00:08.490 --> 00:10.460
That math class was so boring.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.200
It was like one big, giant word problem.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.300
CeCe, that was English.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.410
Rocky?

00:21.450 --> 00:23.550
Hey, look, it's your dad.
Hi, Dr. Blue!

00:23.580 --> 00:25.380
Hi, CeCe.
No detention?

00:26.550 --> 00:28.150
Not yet.

00:28.180 --> 00:31.190
That's my girl.

00:31.220 --> 00:32.450
Hey, Daddy, what're you doing here?

00:32.490 --> 00:34.250
You forgot your lunch.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.560
Um, no, I didn't.
It's right here.

00:36.590 --> 00:39.290
Okay, you caught me.
I just wanted another hug.

00:41.430 --> 00:44.100
Aw.

00:44.130 --> 00:47.400
Hey, I was gone for eight months
with Doctors Without Borders.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.340
They should call it Doctors Without Hugs.

00:50.380 --> 00:54.280
So, after school, you
and me, science museum.

00:54.310 --> 00:57.220
They have a new digestive system exhibit.

00:57.250 --> 01:01.450
The entrance, a giant, realistic intestine.

01:01.490 --> 01:03.390
Don't want to know what the exit is.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.360
Anyway, unfortunately, she can't.

01:06.390 --> 01:08.060
After school we have
to go over to <i>Shake...</i>

01:08.100 --> 01:10.070
Up the math team.

01:10.100 --> 01:13.070
I mean, they've gotten pretty lazy lately.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.370
I mean, especially with those square roots.

01:18.340 --> 01:21.210
No, I meant we have to dance...

01:21.250 --> 01:22.320
Through those algebra problems.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.450
Because that's how we roll.

01:30.290 --> 01:35.160
Oh, that's right.
We do love math.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.600
It's a really great addition to our lives.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.170
And without math it would
just subtract from...

01:43.210 --> 01:45.410
I have no idea what's going on.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.340
Oh, Dad, look!
There's Ty.

01:47.380 --> 01:49.110
He looks like he could use a hug.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.510
Oh!
I'll see ya later!

01:51.550 --> 01:54.280
Ty! You forgot
your lunch, man!

01:57.290 --> 01:58.520
All righty, what's the deal?

01:58.550 --> 02:01.190
Oh, yeah, um...
Funny story.

02:01.220 --> 02:04.190
You know how my dad's all about
me being a doctor, right?

02:04.230 --> 02:06.230
Well, when we auditioned
for <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

02:06.260 --> 02:07.360
He was out of the country and my mom said,

02:07.400 --> 02:08.530
"I don't think
he's gonna like this."

02:08.560 --> 02:10.400
And I said, "Do we really
have to tell him?"

02:10.430 --> 02:12.170
And she said, "I guess not, since you're

02:12.200 --> 02:14.170
"probably not gonna make it on
the show anyway, why upset him?"

02:14.200 --> 02:15.340
But we did make it.
I said, "Telling him over the phone

02:15.370 --> 02:17.070
"is probably a bad idea."
And she said,

02:17.110 --> 02:18.470
"Fine, but you're gonna have to
tell him when he gets home."

02:18.510 --> 02:21.110
And now, he's home and I still
haven't told him.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.280
I thought you said this was a funny story.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.520
Oh, you know what?
You're right. Sad story.

02:28.550 --> 02:31.160
You know how my dad's all
about me being a doctor...

That's the weirdest
video game I've ever seen.

03:32.350 --> 03:35.390
Are you kidding?
This is no video game.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.460
This is the Great Wazoo.

03:39.130 --> 03:40.460
I've been online for years

03:40.500 --> 03:42.200
and I finally found it.

03:42.230 --> 03:45.330
It's my favorite
from when I was a kid.e

03:45.370 --> 03:47.470
I didn't know they had
electricity back then.

03:50.410 --> 03:52.540
Guess not.

03:52.570 --> 03:55.440
You know, you and the Great
Wazoo have a lot in common.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.150
You're both dummies who work for change.

04:03.220 --> 04:04.590
Guess not.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.320
So, let's test-drive
this bad boy.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.550
All right.

04:11.230 --> 04:12.360
Oh, come on!

04:21.269 --> 04:22.400
Oh, no!

04:27.440 --> 04:31.410
Nice. You just
killed the Great Wazoo.

04:31.450 --> 04:34.380
Prediction. Uncle Frank
is going to kill you.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.280
Your outlook, dead.

04:38.220 --> 04:41.220
Can't breathe.
Freaking out.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.290
What am I going to do?

04:44.330 --> 04:45.460
What am I going to do?

04:46.460 --> 04:48.200
You could always slap on a wizard hat

04:48.230 --> 04:50.230
and a beard and climb into the machine.

04:50.270 --> 04:53.500
No way!
I'm afraid of small spaces.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.400
And fake beards.

04:57.610 --> 05:00.470
But I know someone
I can get to climb in there.

05:00.510 --> 05:03.340
Oh. This I gotta see.
What stupid, little...

05:05.180 --> 05:07.450
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

05:12.350 --> 05:15.160
Marcie, honey, that was delicious.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.130
If I didn't know any better,

05:18.160 --> 05:20.130
I'd say you were buttering
me up for something.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.560
Oh, Curtis.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.270
I am pretty full, but fortunately

05:29.300 --> 05:32.070
I saved just enough room
for another helping of hugs!

05:32.110 --> 05:33.510
Come on, now.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.110
Give it up, boy.
Give it up.

05:35.140 --> 05:37.140
Dad, it's getting old.

05:37.180 --> 05:38.380
Well, so is giving you your allowance,

05:38.410 --> 05:40.180
but I seem to be doing that.

05:40.580 --> 05:42.310
Daddy!

05:44.390 --> 05:45.520
Rocky, you're awfully quiet.

05:45.550 --> 05:47.290
Don't you have something to say?

05:47.320 --> 05:49.260
Yeah.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.360
Dad, I bet you're looking forward
to taking Mom out this weekend.

05:51.390 --> 05:54.160
Dinner, maybe?
Dancing afterward?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.130
You like dancing, don't you?

05:56.170 --> 05:58.500
Who doesn't like dancing?
It's America's favorite pastime.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.570
Well, right now I'm going to
dance my way into the kitchen

06:02.610 --> 06:04.310
and get some of your mom's pie.

06:04.340 --> 06:06.510
Ty, help me get dessert.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.250
I don't think you could've
been any more obvious.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.150
Luckily, your father couldn't
have been any more oblivious.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.280
Mom, he's not going to be mad, is he?

06:17.320 --> 06:19.350
Relax, honey, if there's one thing I know,

06:19.390 --> 06:22.490
it's that your father can't be upset
when he's eating some of my pie.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.320
Is this some kind of joke?

06:24.350 --> 06:27.390
You want to be a rapper?
Are you crazy?

06:27.420 --> 06:30.130
It's a legitimate career choice.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.430
Oh, you love rap so much?

06:31.460 --> 06:33.460
Well, let me break it down for you.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.360
Never gonna happen!

06:39.200 --> 06:41.100
Marcie, back me up on this.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.370
Have some pie.

06:46.310 --> 06:50.310
Listen, Ty, no kid of mine
is going into show business.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.180
Your grandfather was a
doctor, I'm a doctor,

06:53.210 --> 06:55.350
your sister's gonna be a doctor,

06:55.380 --> 06:57.280
and so are you.

07:01.190 --> 07:02.350
Mom, what're you doing?

07:02.390 --> 07:04.420
The pie's not working
and I don't want to waste it.

07:04.460 --> 07:07.520
Your father has no idea I bought
that new car while he was away.

07:13.530 --> 07:16.030
Okay, here's the deal.

07:16.070 --> 07:17.370
I get Uncle Frank over here,

07:17.400 --> 07:20.100
you give him a fortune,
then pretend to break down.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.170
That way it'll be his fault

07:21.200 --> 07:23.070
and I don't get
in trouble. Got it?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.410
<i>Yeah. I got it.</i>
<i>You wanna know why?</i>

07:25.440 --> 07:27.340
<i>Because it was my idea!</i>

07:29.210 --> 07:33.350
Look, your idea, my idea.
It doesn't really matter.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.350
What, you got no friends,
you gotta talk to a puppet?

07:40.390 --> 07:43.160
Hey, Uncle Frank.
Why don't you try it out?

07:43.190 --> 07:44.320
My treat.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.060
Okay.

07:47.290 --> 07:51.200
<i>The Great Wazoo</i>
<i>knows all the answers.</i>

07:51.230 --> 07:52.460
<i>Ask away!</i>

07:54.300 --> 07:57.370
Okay. Is anything good
going to happen to me?

07:59.140 --> 08:01.470
<i>Your business will</i>
<i>continue to flourish.</i>

08:02.510 --> 08:04.510
That's great news!

08:04.540 --> 08:07.280
<i>But don't chintz</i>
<i>on the toppings.</i>

08:07.310 --> 08:10.080
<i>And free refills</i>
<i>wouldn't kill you.</i>

08:12.320 --> 08:15.180
Wow, okay, that's even
better than I remembered.

08:16.450 --> 08:19.320
Yeah, it's almost too good.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.260
What happened to the plan?
Why didn't you break down?

08:22.290 --> 08:25.330
<i>I was gonna, but at</i>
<i>25 cents a question,</i>

08:25.360 --> 08:28.500
<i>by the end of the week</i> <i>I should be
able to afford</i> <i>a new video game.</i>

08:30.260 --> 08:32.370
<i>Plus, I look</i>
<i>adorable in this hat.</i>

08:34.240 --> 08:36.370
Look, I don't care if...
Deuce!

08:36.400 --> 08:38.370
Stop talking to the puppet!

08:48.350 --> 08:49.410
Oh, great, you're here.

08:49.450 --> 08:51.180
I'm guessing you finally told your dad.

08:51.220 --> 08:54.350
And now I'm guessing
you didn't tell your dad.

08:54.390 --> 08:58.390
Yeah, I kind of told him there
was emergency choir practice.

09:00.090 --> 09:02.420
Wait, you lied about where you were going

09:02.460 --> 09:05.130
and then put on a costume
to make it seem real?

09:06.200 --> 09:08.200
Yeah.

09:08.230 --> 09:11.270
Bravo!
I'm so proud of you!

09:12.430 --> 09:14.370
Oh, come on, the show's about to start.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.070
Wait, what about if your dad
turns on the TV and sees you?

09:17.100 --> 09:19.100
Don't worry, Ty's got my back.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.280
I know I was a little
hard on you yesterday.

09:24.310 --> 09:27.010
You don't have to be a
doctor to make me proud.

09:27.050 --> 09:29.180
Thanks, Dad.
So I can be a rapper?

09:29.220 --> 09:30.320
Over my dead body.

09:33.190 --> 09:36.160
But you could be a lawyer or an
engineer or an accountant...

09:36.190 --> 09:37.460
An accountant?

09:37.490 --> 09:39.260
Dad, I love music.

09:39.290 --> 09:42.060
There are a lot of accountants
in the music industry.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.430
Someone's got to keep track of all
that money those rappers make.

09:46.130 --> 09:48.260
Dad! No! No TV!

09:50.300 --> 09:51.470
Why?

09:51.500 --> 09:55.500
Uh, it's been so long since
we did anything together.

09:55.540 --> 09:58.170
Let's go to the park.

09:58.210 --> 10:01.040
Ty, I just spent eight
months in a tiny village

10:01.080 --> 10:03.480
fighting off mosquitoes,
scorpions, and dysentery.

10:03.510 --> 10:05.210
I'm not fighting over that remote.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.220
What are you doing?

10:15.260 --> 10:18.530
I want to sit on your lap
again before I get too big.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.400
Daddy!

10:22.370 --> 10:24.340
It's a little late for that.

10:35.180 --> 10:38.520
Wow!
What is Rocky doing on TV?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.430
Uh-oh. Uh...

10:46.460 --> 10:49.260

10:54.230 --> 10:55.400

Can't talk now.

Can I take your order?

11:40.370 --> 11:43.070
I see you're
still thinking. Okay.

11:44.210 --> 11:45.940
Would you like to hear the specials?

11:45.970 --> 11:48.410
Look, Dad, I'm sorry
I hid it from you. Okay?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.140
It was wrong and I shouldn't have done it.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.050
Apology accepted.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.420
Phew, glad that family drama's over.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.090
So would you like to try
Crusty's new stuffed crust

11:59.120 --> 12:01.360
volcano cheesy explosion pizza?

12:03.460 --> 12:06.100
More cheese means more
patients for you, huh, Doc?

12:09.070 --> 12:10.230
Okay!

12:11.230 --> 12:13.370
Dad, can I please stay on the show?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.200
No.
Why not?

12:15.240 --> 12:17.300
Because a surgeon needs steady hands.

12:17.340 --> 12:19.110
Not jazz hands!

12:21.240 --> 12:24.340
Wow. This is just
like at my house.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.080
My dad wants me to go in to
the family business, too.

12:27.110 --> 12:30.420
But until I'm 18 he can't tell
me what the family business is.

12:35.090 --> 12:36.990
I see you still need another minute.
I'll be over there.

12:40.030 --> 12:43.260
Come on, why can't I do both?

12:43.300 --> 12:48.070
Rocky, you can't dance on a TV
show for the rest of your life,

12:48.100 --> 12:49.170
but you can be a surgeon.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.370
That takes dedication.

12:51.410 --> 12:53.110
And dancing is a distraction.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.240
But I love it.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.010
Honey, this isn't a punishment.

12:58.050 --> 13:00.080
This is for your own good.

13:00.110 --> 13:03.950
When I was your age, I was a
pretty good tennis player.

13:03.990 --> 13:07.190
Pretty good? Who am I kidding?
I was amazing.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.090
They called me the Waiter.
The Waiter.

13:11.130 --> 13:12.930
Because I had a killer serve!

13:12.960 --> 13:15.960
That's right, that's right.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.170
But I had to give up tennis
because it was a distraction.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.030
If you want to succeed in life,

13:22.070 --> 13:24.940
you gotta be like me and stay focused.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.170
What is with this place?

13:27.210 --> 13:29.110
Doesn't anybody work here, or what?

13:33.350 --> 13:35.080
I refuse to live in a world

13:35.110 --> 13:37.350
where my best friend can't dance with
me on <i>Shake it Up, Chicago!</i>

13:37.380 --> 13:39.250
This is crazy!

13:39.290 --> 13:41.090
There's got to be some way
we can make this work.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.190
CeCe, don't you have some studying to do?

13:46.230 --> 13:49.160
Studying? Please, you haven't
been gone that long.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.400
CeCe, get out.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.200
Fine.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.040
By the way, she bought a new
car when you were gone.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.340
That girl has some sense of humor.

14:03.380 --> 14:07.120
Here, honey, have some pie.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.020
Now honey, our daughter is unhappy.

14:09.050 --> 14:10.920
What are we going to do about it?

14:10.950 --> 14:12.320
All Rocky needs is a little reminder

14:12.350 --> 14:15.090
about how exciting
the world of medicine is.

14:15.120 --> 14:19.960
That's why I've arranged to have her
observe an actual gallbladder operation.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.360
That beats the kidney transplant

14:22.400 --> 14:24.330
you took us to for our anniversary.

14:24.370 --> 14:26.130
That's right, that's right.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.210
Look, I just can't stand the idea

14:34.240 --> 14:37.280
of us not being together
on <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

14:37.310 --> 14:41.020
Look, I bet if your dad knew
how great a dancer you are

14:41.050 --> 14:43.050
he would let you stay on the show.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.320
Look, he's already made up his mind.
Okay? It's too late.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.990
In fact, he's taking me to the
hospital for an operation.

14:49.020 --> 14:51.090
He's having your legs removed?

14:53.100 --> 14:56.100
No! He's taking me
to go see a surgery.

14:56.130 --> 15:00.270
Oh. There's got to be
something we can do.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.400
<i>The Great Wazoo</i>
<i>knows all the answers.</i>

15:03.440 --> 15:05.040
<i>Ask away!</i>

15:06.340 --> 15:08.180
I'm drawing a blank.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.880
<i>Why not try</i>
<i>the Great Wazoo?</i>

15:10.910 --> 15:12.150
<i>He knows all.</i>

15:13.950 --> 15:15.950
I feel like I'm so close to an answer,

15:15.990 --> 15:19.060
but just cannot put my finger on it.

15:19.090 --> 15:23.060
<i>Seriously!</i> <i>Do not make
me</i> <i>climb out of this box.</i>

15:25.400 --> 15:27.900
Hey, wait a minute.
You want to ask the Great Wazoo?

15:27.930 --> 15:28.930
Good idea!

15:34.170 --> 15:36.040
All right. What should we do
about my Dad not letting me

15:36.070 --> 15:38.180
be on <i>Shake It Up,</i>
<i>Chicago!</i> anymore?

15:38.210 --> 15:40.910
<i>If you cannot bring</i>
<i>a horse to water,</i>

15:40.950 --> 15:42.950
<i>bring water to the horse.</i>

15:44.120 --> 15:45.250
What?
No, I don't get it.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.180
Where am I supposed
to find a thirsty horse?

15:49.220 --> 15:51.250
All right.
CeCe, I think what it's saying is

15:51.290 --> 15:53.220
if my dad won't come
to <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!...</i>

15:53.260 --> 15:55.190
We bonk him on the head, tie
him up, put him in a car,

15:55.230 --> 15:56.330
wait until we get our license

15:56.360 --> 15:58.390
and drive him there to see you dance?

15:59.430 --> 16:01.330
Yeah. Let's call
that plan B.

16:06.940 --> 16:07.970
Aren't you excited, honey?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.340
Actually, I'm a little nervous.

16:09.370 --> 16:12.880
Well, I was a little nervous
before my first operation, too.

16:12.910 --> 16:14.280
Of course, I was the one being operated on.

16:16.180 --> 16:20.220
I was six and having a peanut
removed from my nasal cavity.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.990
I had shoved that thing so far up there

16:22.020 --> 16:24.290
that to this day, every time I sneeze...

16:24.320 --> 16:25.960
Tastes like peanut butter.

16:25.990 --> 16:27.290
That's right, that's right.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.200
Ooh, listen to that.

16:31.230 --> 16:33.060
You see Rocky?

16:33.100 --> 16:35.070
A lot of doctors like to listen
to music during surgery.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.170
It relaxes them.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.300
Most of them pick classical music,

16:38.340 --> 16:40.970
but hey, whatever keeps them awake.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.080
What the heck is going on down there?

16:48.150 --> 16:49.250
Rocky, is that CeCe?

16:50.380 --> 16:53.150
Rocky? Rocky!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.160
He's gone.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.330
No. No, no, no,
you don't know that.

18:18.370 --> 18:21.230
Maybe he was so excited from
seeing you dance he fainted.

18:25.340 --> 18:26.910
Nope, he's gone.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.250
Mom, did Dad come home?

18:36.280 --> 18:38.290
Yes, and he went into the bedroom

18:38.320 --> 18:40.890
and he's been in there ever since.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.030
He must be really upset about that big
surprise dance performance at the hospital.

18:44.060 --> 18:45.330
Oh, good.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.100
I thought he found out
I really did buy a new car.

18:49.230 --> 18:51.300
You know what?
This has gone on long enough.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.000
It's time to deal with this
the old-fashioned way.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.000
We're gonna blame it on CeCe.

18:57.340 --> 18:59.210
No, a family meeting.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.110
We're gonna sit down
together and talk this out.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.310
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.150
We'll sit here all day if we have to.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.120
There they are!

19:11.150 --> 19:13.190
The two most talented kids in the world.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.890
Okay. Family
meeting adjourned.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.260
Wait. You're not mad about
what happened at the hospital?

19:21.290 --> 19:25.970
Well, I was. I was.
And then I realized

19:26.000 --> 19:28.200
you guys are really good

19:28.230 --> 19:30.270
and you just love what you do.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.040
And that's all any father could hope for.

19:33.070 --> 19:36.040
So, does this mean you're going
to let me stay on the show?

19:37.010 --> 19:38.040
Yes.
Yes!

19:39.980 --> 19:42.350
And what about me?

19:42.380 --> 19:44.120
Are you cool with me trying to be a rapper?

19:44.150 --> 19:45.990
Well, that depends.

19:46.020 --> 19:47.320
You cool taking me to the Grammys?

19:47.350 --> 19:48.350
What!

19:51.030 --> 19:53.090
Okay, okay, but we still have
to have a family meeting.

19:53.130 --> 19:55.160
About what?

19:55.200 --> 19:57.360
About why you suddenly decided to
pour yourself into those shorts.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.040
Well, I figured if I was wrong,

20:02.070 --> 20:03.970
maybe my dad was wrong, too.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.340
Stand back.

20:06.380 --> 20:10.980
'Cause it is time for the
Waiter to serve again.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.020
Ow! My neck!
My neck!

20:14.050 --> 20:16.250
My C3!
That's not good.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.250
Um, I'll go get the ice pack.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.290
I'll get the aspirin.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.090
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you, kids.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.290
Honey, I'm so sorry.

20:25.390 --> 20:29.030
See, baby? I told you
they'd make good doctors.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.130
All right, family meeting!

20:34.040 --> 20:36.970
CeCe, it's okay.
No, it's not.

20:37.010 --> 20:40.310
I am not leaving here
until you change your mind

20:40.340 --> 20:42.780
and let Rocky back on
<i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

20:44.150 --> 20:47.380
Well, CeCe, if I was
willing to change my mind,

20:47.420 --> 20:50.320
would you be willing to
bring your grades up?

20:50.630 --> 20:52.380
Now, I'm talking about a B+ average, girl.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.190
B-.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.460
- B.
- Deal!

20:58.160 --> 21:00.330
Hey, CeCe.
Guess what?

21:00.360 --> 21:03.130
He's letting me stay on the show!

21:03.170 --> 21:05.030
You tricked me.

21:05.970 --> 21:07.980
That's right, that's right.

21:32.370 --> 21:34.040
Where'd the Great Wazoo go?

21:34.070 --> 21:36.210
Eh, it wasn't really
bringing in that much cash,

21:36.240 --> 21:38.110
so I sold it to another pizzeria.

21:38.150 --> 21:39.410
You did what?

21:41.150 --> 21:43.480
Um, what pizzeria?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.290
Where exactly?

21:46.320 --> 21:49.120
Italy.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.530
Your cousin Gideon just loaded it
onto his van to take to the airport.

21:53.260 --> 21:54.430
Got you.

21:56.360 --> 22:00.130
So was the little wizard guy,
was he still in there?

22:02.240 --> 22:06.000
No, he walked out and bought
himself a first class ticket.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.070
Of course he was still in there!
He's a puppet!

22:08.110 --> 22:10.110
Good gravy, make a friend.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.420
Is it clear?

22:16.450 --> 22:18.020
Yeah, come on out, buddy.

22:20.020 --> 22:21.290
That'll teach him to bust my machine.

22:21.320 --> 22:24.120
Like I didn't know all along!

22:24.160 --> 22:25.390
Uncle Frank, can I borrow your phone?

22:25.430 --> 22:27.090
You bet, little man.

22:31.030 --> 22:34.130
Deuce, it's me, Flynn.

22:34.170 --> 22:37.070
I'm scared and it's dark

22:37.100 --> 22:39.340
and it smells like airplane fuel.

22:39.370 --> 22:41.140
Don't hang up!
Stay with me, buddy!

22:41.170 --> 22:43.110
I'll be right there.
I just forgot my jacket!

22:43.140 --> 22:44.310
Hey, Flynn.

22:46.180 --> 22:48.140
One, two.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.660
Hey!
