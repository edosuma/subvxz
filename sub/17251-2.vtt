07:58.846 --> 08:00.180

08:17.931 --> 08:20.000
THEY COST 800 BUCKS APIECE.

VIP SUITE.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.591
THEY GOT GOAT CHEESE
UP THERE.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.992
IT'S NOT DOUCHEY
IF IT'S FREE.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.595
- THE GAME STARTS
AT NOON, THOUGH.

08:47.628 --> 08:51.999
- [groans]
WHAT A BUMMER, GUYS.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.935
CLASS ISN'T OVER
TILL AFTER THE GAME.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.238
- I KNOW.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.509
SO WHEN YOU'RE DONE
TEACHING THE CLASS,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.612
BE SURE TO BRING
THE DUMMIES BACK HERE,

09:04.645 --> 09:06.246
WASH THEM DOWN, POLISH THEM UP,
THERE'S THE KEYS. THANKS.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.581

09:07.615 --> 09:08.616
- MM-HMM.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.117
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT BAD KARMA,

09:10.150 --> 09:12.019
THIS IS GENUINELY
TERRIBLE KARMA.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.421
WE ORGANIZED THIS EVENT
TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY,

09:14.454 --> 09:16.757
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE,
TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY,

09:16.790 --> 09:18.058
AND SAVE LIVES.

09:18.091 --> 09:18.792
AND NOW YOU'RE WILLING
TO PROSTITUTE IT

09:18.826 --> 09:21.361
FOR PERSONAL GAIN?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.697
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.334
I USED THE WORD "PROSTITUTE"
AS A VERB.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.039
- HE'S RIGHT, JOHN.
THE KIDS.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.073
- I KNOW.
THE KIDS, WE OWE THEM.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.075
- WE MOST CERTAINLY DO.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.444

HAUL ASS DOWN TO DOUGLAS PARK,

09:37.477 --> 09:38.879

09:41.481 --> 09:43.150
BY KICKOFF, BOY.
- WHAT? NO.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.785
THIS IS SO WRONG, GUYS.
- WHAT'S SO WRONG ABOUT IT?

09:44.818 --> 09:46.787
- I BEG YOUR PARDON.
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.

09:46.820 --> 09:47.955
- LOOK, IF, GOD FORBID, THEY
HAVE TO PERFORM CPR ON SOMEONE,

09:47.988 --> 09:49.122
IT MEANS THAT SOMEONE
IS EITHER DEAD OR DYING,

09:49.156 --> 09:50.924
SO THEY NEED TO DO IT FAST
ANYWAYS.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.427
- WE'RE NOT TEACHING CPR,
WE'RE TEACHING SPEED-PR.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.496
[mimics explosion]
- WAIT, SPEED--

09:56.529 --> 09:57.998
OH, SPEED-PR!
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.633
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.335
- I THINK
THIS IS VERY BAD KARMA.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.674
- BEARS-PACKERS,
50-YARD LINE,

10:06.707 --> 10:08.575
CHEESE FROM A GOAT.
- HMM.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.510
- THIS IS NOT BAD KARMA,

10:10.543 --> 10:11.979
IT'S A DIRECT MESSAGE
FROM THE SON OF GOD HIMSELF.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.514
- MAYBE WE SHOULD BE
ASKING OURSELVES

10:14.547 --> 10:16.449
THAT QUESTION, HMM?

10:16.483 --> 10:20.954
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO
IN THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE?

10:20.988 --> 10:23.691
- HE'D REHIRE DITKA AND PASS
AROUND A BOTTOMLESS JUG OF BEER.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.525
LET'S GO.
- GIVE ME THE KEYS.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.526
GET IN THE RIG.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.196
- [sighs]

10:32.165 --> 10:33.767
- OKAY, KIDS, LISTEN UP,
WE'RE GONNA BE TEACHING YOU

10:33.801 --> 10:35.435
A NEW TYPE OF CPR
CALLED "SPEED-PR."

10:35.468 --> 10:37.370
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME,

10:37.404 --> 10:39.539
SO WE'RE GONNA REALLY
ROLL THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

10:39.572 --> 10:41.008
SO LET'S GET ROLLING.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.642
YES, DEION.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.377
- WHY DON'T WE HAVE ANY TIME?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.546
- OH, WELL,
'CAUSE WHEN YOU DO SPEED-PR,

10:46.579 --> 10:48.515
IT'S LIFE AND DEATH,
IT'S SCARY, AND IT'S FAST.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.817
AND IT TAKES
A LOT OF SPLIT-SECOND DECIS--

10:49.850 --> 10:52.385
UH, DEYONDRE?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.287
- ISN'T THAT ALL THE MORE REASON
WE SHOULD TAKE OUR TIME

10:54.321 --> 10:56.189
WHEN DEALING,
EVEN HYPOTHETICALLY,

10:56.223 --> 10:59.059
WITH SUCH
A SERIOUS MEDICAL SITUATION?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.328
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.964
- YES, DEVONDRE.
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:03.997 --> 11:07.567
- I AM EMT JOHN FARRELL.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.069
- YES, DESHONDRE.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.204
- WHAT'S AN EMT?

11:11.238 --> 11:13.173
- IT STANDS FOR
"EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN."

11:13.206 --> 11:14.641
NOW I THINK THE FIRST--

11:14.674 --> 11:16.043
UH, DEION.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.078
- ARE YOU IN THE ARMY?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.713
- YEAH,
IT'S A LOT LIKE THE ARMY,

11:19.747 --> 11:21.014
EXCEPT WE'RE SAVING LIVES
RIGHT HERE IN CHICAGO.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.183
SO LISTEN UP, GUY--
YES, DEVONDRE?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.651
- ARE YOU A CAPTAIN?
- YEAH.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.719
YEAH.
I'M A CAPTAIN, WHATEVER.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.887
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.721
- WHY DO YOU GET TO BE
A CAPTAIN?

11:27.755 --> 11:29.156
- WHAT?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.490
- WHY DO YOU GET TO BE
A CAPTAIN?

11:30.523 --> 11:31.691
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.060
- IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE
TO ME.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.661
WE STARTED AT THE SAME TIME.
- OH!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.163
- AND I'M A BLACK MAN
IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.531
STANDING IN FRONT OF A GROUP
OF PREDOMINANTLY BLACK--

11:38.565 --> 11:41.268
I AM COLONEL HENRY ST. CLARE.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.536
AND AS CAPTAIN FARRELL'S
COMMANDING OFFICER,

11:43.570 --> 11:44.872
I THINK THE FIRST THING
WE SHOULD DO--

11:44.905 --> 11:46.573
- WHY YOU DON'T
GOT NO EPILEP?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.275
- WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
NO EPILEPS, SIR?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.110
- WHAT THE HELL
IS AN EPILEP?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.745
- MICHAEL JACKSON HAD EPILEPS
ON ALL HIS JACKETS.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.613
WHY YOU DON'T?

11:53.646 --> 11:55.282
- MICHAEL JACKSON DIED
FROM EPILEPS, HAD A SEIZURE.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.084
- ACTUALLY, NO. HE--
- UH, WHO ARE YOU?

11:57.117 --> 12:00.553
- WELL, "CLAREN-SAY"--

12:00.587 --> 12:03.056
- UH, IT'S CLARENCE.

12:05.092 --> 12:09.562
- CLARENCE, I AM A...

12:09.596 --> 12:10.630
SERGEANT.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.032
- [chuckles]
SERGEANT KEVIN.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.034
- BRIAN.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.769
- KEVIN BRIAN?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.971
THAT'S THE WHITEST NAME
I EVER HEARD.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.473
OH, AND MY NAME'S ASHLEY.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.109
- WHY ARE
ALL THE DUMMIES WHITE?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.111
- WHITE PEOPLE DIE TOO.
- NOT IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.046
- OH, DESHONDRE,
WHY ARE YOU KISSING THE DUMMY?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.381
- 'CAUSE I NEVER KISSED
A WHITE BOY BEFORE.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.817
- AIN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO KISS
THE DEAD PERSON

12:29.850 --> 12:31.084
AND BRING THEM BACK TO LIFE?
- SOMETIMES--

12:31.118 --> 12:32.252
- WHY AIN'T THERE
NO GIRL DUMMIES?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.620
- WHY THEY AIN'T GOT
NO TITTIES?

12:33.653 --> 12:34.988
- OH.
- UH, WITH THE LANGUAGE.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.089
- WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING
ON THAT, HUH?

12:36.123 --> 12:38.058
- NIPPLES.
- NO!

12:38.091 --> 12:40.127
NO, DON'T DRAW ON THE DUMMIES.
- DON'T DRAW NO NIPPLES.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.761
COME ON, GUYS.
LISTEN UP, NOW, LISTEN UP.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.396
- WHO DREW A PENIS
ON THIS ONE?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.898
- CAN WE GO FOR A RIDE
IN THE AMBULANCE?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.100
- YEAH, YEAH.
LOOK, NO NIPPLES, NO PENISES.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.102
ALTHOUGH THIS IS VERY QUALITY
WORK, YOU'RE VERY TALENTED.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.303
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAVE
MICHAEL JACKSON?

12:50.337 --> 12:51.638
- BECAUSE HE LIVES
IN CALIFORNIA.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.006
- BUT YOU SAID
YOU WAS THE ARMY.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.574
- ARMY CAN INVADE IRAQ,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.643
BUT IT CAN'T SAVE A BLACK MAN
IN CALIFORNIA?

12:56.676 --> 12:58.311
DAMN SHAME.
- YEAH, COLONEL.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.147
WHY COULDN'T YOU SAVE
A BLACK MAN IN CALIFORNIA?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.682
NO, HEY!
- HOLY SH--!

13:02.715 --> 13:04.284
- YOU SAID THEY COULD
GO FOR A RIDE.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.019
- OH, SH--.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.855
I'M CALLING THERESA.
SHE'S IN LAWNDALE TODAY.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.789
- LOOK, TELL HER TO KEEP IT
ON THE D.L., BECAUSE IF WE MAKE

13:09.823 --> 13:11.091
AN OFFICIAL REPORT, WE GOTTA
GO DOWN THERE AND FILE AND--

13:11.124 --> 13:13.260
SH--!

13:13.293 --> 13:15.295
IF WE GET THE RIG BACK FAST,
WE CAN STILL MAKE THE GAME.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.096
- IS TIGER WOODS
REALLY BLACK?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.730
- NO.
- YES.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.536
- GUYS, THIS IS
MY NEW PARTNER BILLY.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.973
- I'M BILLY CEPEDA, Y'ALL.
- JOHNNY, HANK, BRIAN.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.507
- WHAT HAPPENED TO DENZEL?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.342
- [laughs] THEY CALL DANNY
"DENZEL WASHINGTON."

13:29.376 --> 13:31.778
HE GOT TRANSFERRED
TO ANOTHER PRECINCT,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.513
AND SO NOW I'M WORKING

13:33.546 --> 13:34.848
WITH PUERTO RICAN MATT DILLON
LOOK-ALIKE OVER HERE.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.284
- I DO NOT LOOK
LIKE MATT DILLON.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.986
GUYS, DO I LOOK
LIKE MATT DILLON?

13:39.019 --> 13:40.320
- NO.
- YES.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.154
- GUYS, WE SHOULD REALLY
CALL THIS IN.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.990
- NO! NO, NO, NO.
- NO!

13:43.023 --> 13:44.191
IT'LL LEAD TO HOURS AND HOURS
OF PAPERWORK.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.292
- LOOK, HEAD DOWN
WEST ROOSEVELT.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.626
THEY'RE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.061
THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST ON A JOYRIDE.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.629
- HOW DID THEY GET AWAY
WITH THE RIG ANYWAY?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.464
- WE WERE LEADING A CPR CLASS
IN THE PARK--

13:51.498 --> 13:53.333
- AND WHILE WE WERE FOCUSED
ON ACTUAL CPR TRAINING,

13:53.366 --> 13:54.868
THEY GOT IN THE RIG
AND TOOK OFF.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.870
- HOW DOES AN 11-YEAR-OLD
EVEN KNOW HOW TO DRIVE?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.506
- I SAW A FIVE-YEAR-OLD MONKEY
DRIVING A LITTLE MOTORIZED CAR

13:59.539 --> 14:02.542
ONE TIME ON YOUTUBE,
IN CHINA, MAN,

14:02.575 --> 14:05.678
AND BEHIND HIM
WAS THIS BEAR ON A UNICYCLE.

14:05.712 --> 14:09.349
BEAR LOOKED LIKE HE WAS,
LIKE, AT LEAST...

14:12.419 --> 14:14.387
HE WAS PROBABLY,
LIKE, EIGHT, RIGHT?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.990
SO THE MONKEY
CRASHES THE CAR,

14:17.024 --> 14:20.060
AND THEN THE BEAR
GETS OFF THE UNICYCLE,

14:20.093 --> 14:23.931
AND THEN THE BEAR
EATS THE MONKEY!

14:23.964 --> 14:26.033
[laughs]

14:28.268 --> 14:31.071
HEY, YOU GUYS HUNGRY?

14:31.104 --> 14:33.206
- SO IS THIS CPR CLASS
A NEW THING?

14:33.240 --> 14:34.374
- UH, YEAH, IT'S CHARITY.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.375
WE'RE GIVING BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.876
- MM-HMM.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.511
- THAT'S REALLY SWEET.
- YEAH.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.879
- WHOSE IDEA WAS IT?
- IT WAS MINE.

14:39.913 --> 14:40.880
- MINE.
- MAC'S.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.515
- TOGETHER.
- MAC'S.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.184
- TOGETHER WE CAME UP WITH IT.
- MAC'S IDEA.

18:33.313 --> 18:37.116
[all shout]

18:37.150 --> 18:39.252

18:39.286 --> 18:41.521

19:05.578 --> 19:08.147
THERE'S A PATIENT IN THE BACK.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.716

19:09.749 --> 19:11.284
WE WAS JUST GONNA

19:11.318 --> 19:14.687
BUT THEN WE SAW THIS DUDE
COLLAPSE IN THE STREET.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.190

19:20.693 --> 19:23.530
ACTUALLY TURNED YOU
INTO HEROES.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.298
- HELL NO.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.033
THESE TWO WAS PREACHING
SOME SPEED-PR BULLSH--.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.068
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
ANY OF IT.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.470
WE LEARNED CPR
AT A CAMP LAST SUMMER

19:30.503 --> 19:32.539
FROM THIS BIG GUY
NAMED CASSIUS CLAY.

19:32.572 --> 19:37.544

VIP, FOR THE BEARS-PACKERS GAME.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.246
YO, MAN.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.216

19:57.096 --> 20:00.233
[laughs]

20:00.267 --> 20:02.001
SPEED-PR.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.370
HA!

20:03.403 --> 20:05.838
KARMA CAN BE SUCH A BITCH.

20:05.872 --> 20:10.610
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
SHE GIVES YOU A HAND,

20:10.643 --> 20:13.613
AND THEN SOMETIMES SHE PISSES
RIGHT DOWN YOUR LEG.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.914
GOD.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.750
- [laughing]
PISSING...

20:17.784 --> 20:20.219

20:46.746 --> 20:49.949

20:49.982 --> 20:53.953
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.492
