WEBVTT

00:28.680 --> 00:30.726
There's our distraction.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.297
Finally!

00:36.297 --> 00:37.776
Whoa.

00:37.776 --> 00:40.344
Hey! It's not supposed
to distract us.

00:51.877 --> 00:54.489
Oh, my God, we did it!
We're free!

00:54.489 --> 00:56.317
That tunnel you burrowed
was crazy!

00:56.317 --> 00:58.797
We were up and down
and up and down.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.539
That's 'cause I modeled it on
that game "Chutes and Ladders."

01:01.539 --> 01:03.759
Oh, that game's impossible.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.326
Let's get out of here!

01:11.419 --> 01:14.248
<i>The convicts are armed
and dangerous, but whatever.</i>

01:14.248 --> 01:16.946
<i>Let's get to the only escape
anyone cares about--</i>

01:16.946 --> 01:20.515
<i>An adorable baby giraffe
snuck out of the zoo!</i>

01:20.515 --> 01:22.517
Aww!

01:22.517 --> 01:25.041
If you see the wittle giwaffe
awound town,

01:25.041 --> 01:27.174
pwease contact the zoo immediatwee.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.045
That poor little baby!

01:29.045 --> 01:31.221
I'll tell you what I won't
be doing if I see it--

01:31.221 --> 01:32.744
contacting the zoo.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.877
I'd show that giraffe
the night of its life

01:34.877 --> 01:37.140
before it's hauled back
to captivity forever.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.185
That...

01:38.185 --> 01:40.143
actually makes sense.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.884
- Yeah, screw the zoo.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.320
Great. We all agree.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.017
Now, you know what else
would be great?

01:45.017 --> 01:46.541
A theme song.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.195
- Oh, right, right, right.
- Mm. Oh, yeah.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.370
Eh, I don't know.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.592
<i>♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪</i>

02:22.838 --> 02:24.753
I love Spirit Week!

02:24.753 --> 02:28.017
I'm literally bursting
with school pride.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.411
At least I hope
that's what this is.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.066
What better way
to honor our school

02:34.066 --> 02:36.068
than a
"Teachers Hall of Fame."

02:36.068 --> 02:38.767
Show everyone the greats
who made Pearl Bailey

02:38.767 --> 02:40.899
the amazing school
it is today.

02:40.899 --> 02:44.207
On premium
library real estate, no less.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.514
How'd you lock that up,
Stevie baby?

02:46.514 --> 02:47.993
The library has extra space

02:47.993 --> 02:49.995
'cause Principal Lewis
destroyed most of the books

02:49.995 --> 02:52.781
when he and his buddies
were playing flamethrower tag.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.348
Rest in peace, buddies.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.220
We're close.
Let's test it out.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.875
<i>I'm Mr. D'Angelo.</i>

02:59.875 --> 03:03.879
<i>I was the first teacher to say,
"Talk amongst yourselves,"</i>

03:03.879 --> 03:06.751
<i>and leave for the rest
of the day.</i>

03:06.751 --> 03:10.407
If I know our peers,
they're gonna love this.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.237
Spirit Week, bitches!

03:16.674 --> 03:19.721
Isosceleeeees...

03:19.721 --> 03:22.376
Can you believe I'm just now
discovering the magic

03:22.376 --> 03:25.074
of mixing Mentos
and Diet Coke together?

03:25.074 --> 03:27.424
I'm testing out recipes
for a badass foam show

03:27.424 --> 03:28.686
on the football field.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.558
Our robots are ruined!

03:30.558 --> 03:31.515
Pfft.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.474
You wanna see ruined robots,

03:33.474 --> 03:35.563
let me have 'em for the night.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.218
Spirit Week!

03:38.218 --> 03:40.524
Ugh, this is
gonna take forever to fix.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.178
What's the point, Steve?

03:42.178 --> 03:45.007
As long as that madman Lewis
is in charge,

03:45.007 --> 03:46.835
this school is screwed.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.315
He ruins everything.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.534
Sorry, Steve.
I'm out, too.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.885
All this "Spirit Week" talk
is just too scary for me.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.061
Reminds me of ghosts.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.503
Damn it!

04:02.503 --> 04:04.679
Hey, where'd your friends go?

04:07.899 --> 04:10.467
Please sit.
I've got a lot to explain.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.035
You're the lawyer for all
the school bus drivers, right?

04:13.035 --> 04:14.558
No, I'm a kid...

04:14.558 --> 04:16.430
here to file
a formal complaint.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.562
Against Principal Lewis.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.869
Ah, yes, yes, a kid.

04:20.869 --> 04:23.045
You realize
how serious this is?

04:23.045 --> 04:25.743
I do,
but I love Pearl Bailey,

04:25.743 --> 04:28.093
and Principal Lewis
is a destructive menace

04:28.093 --> 04:30.531
who doesn't care
about the school.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.489
He ruined
my Spirit Week project,

04:32.489 --> 04:35.100
he hired his cousin Dale
as a school nurse,

04:35.100 --> 04:36.928
and all he does
is smoke cigarettes,

04:36.928 --> 04:39.148
plus, Lewis taught
a group of crows

04:39.148 --> 04:42.020
to attack anyone
with a rolling backpack.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.763
Legally I can't admit fault
of any kind,

04:45.763 --> 04:48.113
as you know,
being a kid lawyer and all.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.724
Well, you have to do
something!

04:49.724 --> 04:51.421
This is
a formal complaint.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.641
Fine.
I'll open an investigation.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.947
Hey, before I get into
this school bus fiasco,

04:55.947 --> 04:57.340
let me ask you something--

04:57.340 --> 04:59.255
What's the fastest
you'd feel comfortable

04:59.255 --> 05:00.996
being thrown
from a school bus?

05:00.996 --> 05:03.825
I'm looking for a number
over 70.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.352
No, reach higher, Jeff!

05:09.352 --> 05:11.572
I need the big juicy ones.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.705
You guys want my apple salsa
to be good, right?

05:14.705 --> 05:16.098
We do.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.492
Just grab the big juicy ones,
Jeff!

05:18.492 --> 05:20.189
No, higher, Jeff!

05:20.189 --> 05:22.278
The big juicy ones!

05:25.281 --> 05:26.587
Ahh!

05:43.778 --> 05:45.823
Was it worth it, Jeff?

05:45.823 --> 05:49.261
Disrespecting me
to pet a giraffe?

05:51.742 --> 05:53.396
I'll bet you guys never had

05:53.396 --> 05:56.399
to sneak in at night
to avoid an insane principal.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.836
Yeah, you legends
were probably too busy

05:58.836 --> 06:00.316
to come in at night anyway.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.492
VIP-ing your way around town,

06:02.492 --> 06:04.407
banging everything
with a heartbeat.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.930
Would you just come on?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.802
Gotta hide for a second.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.544
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.809
Yeah. Here they are,

06:14.809 --> 06:16.767
the blueprints
to the school.

06:16.767 --> 06:20.205
Not really sure why late-night
copy machine repairmen

06:20.205 --> 06:21.555
would need these,
but--

06:22.425 --> 06:23.644
Perfect.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.428
These'll show us
the structural points

06:25.428 --> 06:27.169
where we need
to plant the dynamite...

06:27.169 --> 06:30.433
to blow this school
to smithereens.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.614
All. Clean.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.491
All right,
we got the blueprints.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.449
But we still have
a huge problem.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.278
Where are
we gonna unroll them?

06:49.278 --> 06:51.454
How 'bout the table
by them robots, boss?

06:51.454 --> 06:53.151
Good eye.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.332
You know, one day
humans are gonna only sex

07:00.332 --> 07:01.638
each other through robots.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.118
How do you know that?

07:03.118 --> 07:04.554
Because my aunt
used to say it

07:04.554 --> 07:06.687
whenever we went
to Chuck E. Cheese.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.994
Okay, let's hit here,
here, and here,

07:09.994 --> 07:12.214
and we'll start
with the boiler room.

07:12.214 --> 07:15.304
Come on.
Let's get started.

07:19.264 --> 07:22.790
<i>♪ I'm gonna take my class
to the old classroom ♪</i>

07:22.790 --> 07:24.487
-<i>♪ I'm gonna teach ♪</i>
- Oh, my, God, they work!

07:24.487 --> 07:26.576
-<i>♪ Till I can't no more ♪</i>
- Shit.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.883
<i>♪ I'm gonna take my class... ♪</i>

07:28.883 --> 07:30.754
One of the robots
is making a break for it!

07:30.754 --> 07:31.886
That's a kid.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.627
Toad-Button,
you go after him.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.324
We'll start planting
the bombs.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.936
Thank goodness
I wore my brand-new

07:38.936 --> 07:40.547
Skerchers SuperSpeeders.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.244
<i>That's right, Dadders!</i>

07:42.244 --> 07:45.334
<i>Steve wears the brand-new
Skerchers SuperSpeeders</i>

07:45.334 --> 07:47.075
<i>by Skerchers Sneakers.</i>

07:47.075 --> 07:49.730
<i>Now with real rubber.</i>

07:51.035 --> 07:52.515
Aah!

07:52.515 --> 07:53.908
If you're gonna kill me,

07:53.908 --> 07:56.476
pass along my funeral requests
to my friend Snot.

07:56.476 --> 08:01.437
Tell him-- open casket,
eyes wide, huge smile.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.091
Oh, thank God, it's you.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.658
You're too kind, Steve.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.835
I wish everyone was as happy
to have me around as you.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.490
I guess someone formally
complained about me.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.970
The superintendent wants to meet
with me in the morning.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.755
I'm as good as gone.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.757
Just grabbing my most
important stuff in case

08:16.757 --> 08:19.107
I'm not allowed back
on the premises.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.805
Gosh, that's terrible
about the investigation.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.415
Did I say "investigation"?

08:23.415 --> 08:26.157
Some guys broke in, and they're
gonna blow up the school!

08:26.157 --> 08:27.898
Let 'em!
Screw this place!

08:27.898 --> 08:29.770
Oh, man, I love it here!

08:29.770 --> 08:31.119
This'll be a great talk
for later.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.121
They're looking for me.
We gotta go!

08:33.121 --> 08:34.905
It's not fair!

08:34.905 --> 08:36.646
I just finally fundraised
enough money

08:36.646 --> 08:38.648
to trick out my office.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.349
You lovin'
these hydraulics?

08:48.136 --> 08:50.921
You didn't mention the guys
with bombs had guns, too!

08:50.921 --> 08:52.488
Bullets are my Kryptonite!

08:52.488 --> 08:53.794
Follow me.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.670
You're lucky
you're with me.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.324
No one knows this school
like I do.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.586
I should call the police.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.893
Damn, no service down here.

09:05.893 --> 09:10.637
Oh, God forbid a kid goes
five minutes without his phone.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.682
I'm trying to save
the school!

09:12.682 --> 09:15.511
I can't believe my fate's
in your crazy-ass hands.

09:15.511 --> 09:19.167
They're so crazy,
they just might work.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.909
Hey, they worked!

09:24.694 --> 09:26.000
So?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.523
How pimp is this place!

09:27.523 --> 09:28.916
It's uh, great.
Where's the exit?

09:28.916 --> 09:30.439
Nowhere. We kick back

09:30.439 --> 09:32.354
and wait it out here
until this blows over.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.616
"Wait it out"?

09:33.616 --> 09:34.922
What if they find us?

09:34.922 --> 09:37.620
And what about
the school blowing up?

09:37.620 --> 09:41.232
We're fine. This is my
panic room, and it's bombproof.

09:41.232 --> 09:44.061
Designed it myself.
Even built the fireplace.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.410
Briiick.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.064
Just relax, Smith.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.110
Can I get you a drink?
Are you a brandy kid?

09:49.110 --> 09:51.025
Oh, hey, you mind
taking your shoes off?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.983
You destroyed the library
with foam

09:52.983 --> 09:56.378
and you want me
to take off my shoes?

09:57.858 --> 09:59.511
This is such bullshit.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.688
Look at all the work
you did down here,

10:01.688 --> 10:04.821
but you can't be bothered
to care about the actual school.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.737
Smith, I do my job
better than anybody.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.521
And whoever reported me
to the superintendent

10:09.521 --> 10:11.175
got it as wrong as you.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.177
Aah!
Toad-Button found us!

10:13.177 --> 10:14.657
Did you say...

10:14.657 --> 10:15.745
Toad-Button?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.355
Yeah, what a stupid name.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.010
Well, could be cute
on the right guy.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.403
Is this
who was chasing you?

10:21.403 --> 10:22.970
That's him!

10:22.970 --> 10:25.712
Damn, he's aged very well.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.062
Everything always works out
for the bad boys.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.020
I should've known
they'd be back.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.501
Of course they're
your former students.

10:32.501 --> 10:35.112
You've been terrorizing kids
for 30 years.

10:35.112 --> 10:38.681
Man, '94 was a hell of a class.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.988
Those kids could dress.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.818
This place is bombproof, huh?

10:44.818 --> 10:46.167
What do we do?

10:46.167 --> 10:49.213
Oh, people got so hammered
at that prom.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.650
At least I did.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.697
The chimney's
our only way out!

10:54.697 --> 10:56.481
Yes.
Into the Christmas tunnel.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.097
The gym?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.796
Dang, I got something
in my eye.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.058
Do you see anything?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.715
Aah!

11:16.763 --> 11:19.548
Why would you build a chimney
into another room?

11:19.548 --> 11:21.202
I only had this many bricks.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.726
This is why all our
gym teachers have lung disease.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.816
Well, no one seemed to mind when
it smoked out all the pigeons.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.645
Yep, those are
Toad-Button's buddies.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.342
Yeah, it's beautiful
they stayed in touch,

11:31.342 --> 11:32.822
but how are we
getting out of here?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.824
Don't worry. There's gotta be
something in my bag

11:34.824 --> 11:35.912
that can help us.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.698
Useful, useful, useful...

11:38.698 --> 11:40.743
but not for this.

11:40.743 --> 11:41.918
A cord?

11:41.918 --> 11:43.572
I don't remember
packing a--

11:46.836 --> 11:49.534
Did you...
hear something?

11:49.534 --> 11:51.841
I've heard that the dry-cleaning
business will eat you alive

11:51.841 --> 11:53.277
if you don't have
the right mentor.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.759
Hmm, I'm not sure
that's what it was.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.239
But maybe.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.461
We can get out there!

12:05.899 --> 12:08.640
Okay, that's the last
of the explosives.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.730
Now we just wait until
that bastard Lewis

12:10.730 --> 12:14.559
shows up in the morning
so he can watch it happen.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.129
Are you flirting with me,
Smith?

12:19.129 --> 12:21.131
No!
I'm flirting with death,

12:21.131 --> 12:23.090
and it sounds like
they're here because of you.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.135
Pft.
That's why I'm here.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.531
Play it cool.

12:29.531 --> 12:33.013
We are six non-giraffes
looking for a place to eat.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.754
Right this way.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.610
We should go.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.874
My brother-in-law is upset
because he prefers

13:07.874 --> 13:10.224
the Stevie Wonder version
of "Happy Birthday."

13:10.224 --> 13:12.095
We'll obviously be paying
for none of this

13:12.095 --> 13:13.488
and taking it all to go.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.273
And toss a couple
White Russians in here.

13:17.187 --> 13:20.843
Uhh, it feels so good to talk
at full volume again!

13:20.843 --> 13:22.105
♪ La la la ♪

13:22.105 --> 13:23.411
Shut up!

13:23.411 --> 13:24.934
We're almost home free.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.197
Just gotta figure out
how to get down.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.895
I got us covered.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.902
Wow, two inflatable Grim Reapers
made the cut.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.251
<i>- Grims.</i>
- What?

13:37.251 --> 13:38.513
Grims Reaper.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.645
It's the same
as "brothers-in-law."

13:40.645 --> 13:42.604
I have two Grims Reaper.

13:42.604 --> 13:43.866
I'm sorry to nitpick.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.869
That's just
one of my biggest pets peeve.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.218
Okay, so what now?

13:48.218 --> 13:49.350
Climb on.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.352
I'll puncture it,
and it'll deflate,

13:51.352 --> 13:53.876
sinking you down to the ground,
where you can run to safety.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.619
That's actually
a great idea.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.055
Wait, just me?

13:59.055 --> 14:00.883
This is where we part ways, Smith.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.624
I'm their principal,
and I think

14:02.624 --> 14:04.582
I can still get through to them
before it's too late.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.802
But you're not
their principal anymore.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.196
Being a principal is like
being a murderer, Smith--

14:09.196 --> 14:11.067
You carry that label forever.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.287
Forget about them.
They hate you.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.419
So?
I saved you, didn't I?

14:15.419 --> 14:18.248
And you're the one who reported
me to the superintendent.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.076
You-- You knew that?

14:20.076 --> 14:21.773
And you've still been
helping me?

14:21.773 --> 14:24.733
Of course I have.
I'm your principal.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.213
And whether you approve
of my style

14:26.213 --> 14:29.303
or not, I take my role
very seriously.

14:31.479 --> 14:35.004
Now I've got students
to get through to.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.528
Aah! Toad-Button!

14:37.528 --> 14:39.226
You startled me.

14:39.226 --> 14:43.230
Nice to see you again,
Principal Lewis.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.796
Heyyyy.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.191
Principal Lewis,
I've decided

14:48.191 --> 14:50.193
that I can't
leave you here alone.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.804
Y'know, I see you're a big fan
of pistol-whipping.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.937
But you know
what knocks me out?

14:54.937 --> 14:56.939
Bebop jazz.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.250
We thought we were
gonna have to wait

15:03.250 --> 15:05.165
until morning for you
to show up,

15:05.165 --> 15:09.517
but I should've known
you'd be here, working late.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.475
I wasn't working.
I swear!

15:11.475 --> 15:12.781
Those days
are behind me!

15:12.781 --> 15:14.130
I-I can vouch for that.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.827
Yeah, right.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.961
Now you're gonna watch us
destroy your precious school,

15:18.961 --> 15:22.312
just like you destroyed
our lives.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.835
Guys, you can't.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.925
You do something this big
and leave two eyewitnesses,

15:25.925 --> 15:27.187
you're gonna get caught.

15:27.187 --> 15:30.930
Then maybe we don't leave
any witnesses.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.194
Look, I know I ruined
your lives,

15:34.194 --> 15:35.891
but let me help you now.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.981
I got a guy in Mexico who can
set you up with new identities.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.591
Plus he works
at the Hilton pool.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.245
You can swim, get some sun.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.551
Those amazing
rolled-up towels.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.595
Mm, huh? Mm?

15:44.595 --> 15:45.945
Don't listen, boss.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.773
He'll say anything to save
his beloved school.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.688
I'm sorry.
Beloved school?

15:50.688 --> 15:52.125
Working late?

15:52.125 --> 15:54.257
Are we talking about
the same Principal Lewis?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.520
This guy disbanded
the school chorus because

15:56.520 --> 16:00.220
he was afraid the singing
might "attract Sasquatches."

16:00.220 --> 16:02.222
I don't know what he's been up
to recently, kid.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.919
We've been in jail.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.966
But how about we tell you
our experience with Lewis?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.011
Okay, so back
in the early '90s--

16:09.011 --> 16:12.058
Sorry, Toadie. I know I said
"we," but I got this.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.799
So back when we were
in school--

16:14.799 --> 16:16.279
<i>TOAD-BUTTON:
Was it not the early '90s?</i>

16:16.279 --> 16:17.846
<i>I feel like that helps.</i>

16:17.846 --> 16:21.981
<i>Yes, okay,
back in the early '90s,</i>

16:21.981 --> 16:24.374
<i>we used to struggle
as students,</i>

16:24.374 --> 16:26.115
<i>but Lewis saw our potential</i>

16:26.115 --> 16:28.596
<i>and was determined
to get the most out of us.</i>

16:28.596 --> 16:31.164
Aww, Jerry.
Gimme a hug.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.209
I'm obviously not finished!

16:33.209 --> 16:35.211
<i>But no matter how well we did,</i>

16:35.211 --> 16:37.561
<i>nothing was ever good enough
for this guy.</i>

16:37.561 --> 16:41.043
<i>Eventually we couldn't take it
anymore and snapped.</i>

16:41.043 --> 16:43.872
<i>We dropped out,
started getting into trouble,</i>

16:43.872 --> 16:45.439
<i>and wound up in jail.</i>

16:48.964 --> 16:50.748
All because of him.

16:50.748 --> 16:51.793
In the early '90s.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.317
That's right, Steve.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.798
I used to try to get the most
out of my students.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.321
I used to be...

16:58.321 --> 16:59.975
a bad principal.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.629
I...don't follow.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.022
You see, the problem was,

17:03.022 --> 17:05.067
I was acting like
a strict parent,

17:05.067 --> 17:07.156
when all these kids
already had parents.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.810
Actually I lost
both my parents.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.290
It was just
too much pressure.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.987
What they needed
was a friend.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.816
It's not princi-parent.
It's princi-pal.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.645
So I became the most fun pal
I could be.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.473
And, yes, over the years
that may have drifted

17:19.473 --> 17:21.127
into [bleep] up uncle territory,

17:21.127 --> 17:23.303
but the results speak
for themselves--

17:23.303 --> 17:25.131
The only time kids
go to jail anymore

17:25.131 --> 17:26.828
is when they're there
visiting me.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.090
Wow.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.440
So all this time I thought
you were nuts...

17:30.440 --> 17:32.094
I was right.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.269
It was a car accident,

17:33.269 --> 17:35.489
in case
anybody's interested.

17:35.489 --> 17:38.883

17:38.883 --> 17:39.971

18:05.562 --> 18:06.955
You know what's ironic?

18:06.955 --> 18:09.088
We were doing all this
for the giraffe,

18:09.088 --> 18:12.221
but I think he showed us
the night of our lives.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.266
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.534
Whoa, a giraffe!

18:20.534 --> 18:22.492
Looks like y'all had
a crazy night.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.713
Yeah, but I guess he has
to go back to the zoo now.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.367
Wait.

18:27.367 --> 18:31.110
I might have an idea that'll
keep him out of the zoo forever.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.285
Please!

18:32.285 --> 18:33.938
You gotta believe me!

18:33.938 --> 18:35.984
I'm not a baby giraffe!

18:35.984 --> 18:37.594
I'm a human man!

18:37.594 --> 18:41.642
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you and
every other animal in this zoo.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.862
Don't worry, babe!
We'll be back!

18:44.862 --> 18:46.777
I got an annual pass.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.433
Guys, if you wanna
destroy the school,

18:50.433 --> 18:52.174
just leave this man
in charge.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.872
He will eventually do it,
I guarantee.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.831
And your hands'll be clean.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.311
Enough stalling.

18:58.311 --> 19:01.357
Any last requests before
your school goes sky-high?

19:03.533 --> 19:07.015
How about we raise a final toast
to old Pearl Bailey?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.843
With what beverage?

19:08.843 --> 19:11.498
With the champagne
of colas,

19:11.498 --> 19:12.803
Diet Coke.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.640
He's trying to kill himself
before we blow up the school.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.728
That's enough.

19:27.514 --> 19:28.863
Stop!

19:34.129 --> 19:35.652
- Ah, gross!
- Ugh!

19:35.652 --> 19:37.306
This is just sad.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.613
Please blow up the school.
We deserve it at this point.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.441
Sorry.
I meant to do this.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.793
Um, is he flirting with me?

19:53.017 --> 19:54.367
- Oh!
- Ooh!

19:58.327 --> 20:00.547
There is no way he meant
to do that.

20:06.074 --> 20:09.208
He may not be perfect,
but he really does care.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.514
I know his old students tried
to blow up the school,

20:11.514 --> 20:13.864
but his current students
just complain.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.040
I think he's moving
in the right direction here.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.303
Thanks, Steve.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.696
I guess it's kind of
like Steinbeck says--

20:19.696 --> 20:23.091
"Now that I'm not asking you
to be perfect, you can be good."

20:23.091 --> 20:25.180
See?
He knows Steinbeck.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.313
Of course I know
Sherm Steinbeck!

20:27.313 --> 20:29.445
You're not gonna find
a better amateur dentist

20:29.445 --> 20:30.881
than that guy.

20:30.881 --> 20:33.449
All right, we'll let Mr. Lewis
off with a warning.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.625
So what happened to
those convicts anyway?

20:35.625 --> 20:37.236
Back to prison, I assume?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.194
Y'know, as their principal,

20:39.194 --> 20:41.065
I just didn't think
more prison time

20:41.065 --> 20:43.067
was the answer
for those kids.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.985
Here are the passports
for your new identities.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.987
Hop in. I already picked up
my other client,

20:49.987 --> 20:51.554
so next stop's Mexico.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.604
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
