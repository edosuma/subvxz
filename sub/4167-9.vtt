WEBVTT

00:02.077 --> 00:03.953
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:04.038 --> 00:07.166
Peter Scottson served
with dignity and honour.

00:07.291 --> 00:11.587
- What in the hell is this?
- The Softail Deluxe.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.840
- What the fuck is it doing in my atrium?
- I bought it. It's mine.

00:14.924 --> 00:16.967
We're not having sex, Mrs Botwin.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.803
- Oh, really?
- I honour God with my abstinence.

00:19.887 --> 00:23.933
What we need is to redirect a small portion
of our sewage through your town.

00:24.016 --> 00:25.935
Shit highway could be our road to riches.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.144
We need these votes.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.730
I'm thinking a golf membership.

00:29.813 --> 00:30.814
I play house.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.191
She's all yours.

00:32.316 --> 00:34.902
Thank you, Sullivan Groff.

00:34.985 --> 00:38.280
- I had cancer.
- I don't care.

00:39.949 --> 00:43.369
Agrestic and Majestic are never gonna merge.
I told them about your deal with Celia.

00:43.452 --> 00:46.455
This project is on hold
until there is a full report on the dirt shrew,

00:46.539 --> 00:50.709
and I'm referring to the endangered animal,
not the one in the hard hat and heels

00:50.793 --> 00:52.795
who's been sucking your dick.

00:57.007 --> 01:00.844
Very funny, Tim. Open the door.
Open the fucking door!

01:00.928 --> 01:02.805
- I know who you are.
- Excuse me?

01:02.888 --> 01:05.516
Why are you here?

01:05.599 --> 01:08.561
And why the fuck are you stalking me?

01:14.358 --> 01:18.070
<i>Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:18.195 --> 01:21.156
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:21.240 --> 01:24.618
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:24.702 --> 01:27.538
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:27.580 --> 01:30.958
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:31.041 --> 01:34.378
<i># A blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:34.461 --> 01:37.673
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:37.756 --> 01:40.843
<i># They all look just the same</i>

01:42.219 --> 01:45.681
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:45.764 --> 01:48.767
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:48.851 --> 01:52.354
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

01:52.438 --> 01:55.065
<i># And they came out all the same</i>

01:55.149 --> 01:59.153
<i># And there's doctors and there's lawyers</i>

01:59.236 --> 02:02.114
<i># And business executives</i>

02:02.197 --> 02:05.492
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

02:05.576 --> 02:09.371
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:13.834 --> 02:15.586
Well? I'm waiting.

02:16.712 --> 02:19.256
- If you'd...
- Keep your body still.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.092
Move your lips. Make sentences.

02:22.885 --> 02:24.511
What are those lines?

02:26.263 --> 02:29.141
You'll get a full diagnostic
report from the doctor.

02:29.225 --> 02:30.392
But you know.

02:31.393 --> 02:33.229
You have a week to live.

02:33.312 --> 02:35.522
- That's not funny.
- Tickled me.

02:35.606 --> 02:37.274
What the fuck are you doing here?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.109
You want to get some coffee or something?

02:39.193 --> 02:41.946
You're an insane stalker person.
Why would I go anywhere with you?

02:42.029 --> 02:44.240
To talk, to explain.

02:44.740 --> 02:48.118
And... Sorry if I freaked you out.

02:48.202 --> 02:51.789
And I swear I'm not dangerous, and I'll buy.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.709
Latte, cookies, name it.

02:57.253 --> 03:00.381
You're gonna keep stalking me
unless I do this, aren't you?

03:00.422 --> 03:04.134
I can't answer definitively
yes or no at this point.

03:04.218 --> 03:08.347
Fine. There's a place across the street.
I'll meet you there in an hour.

03:08.472 --> 03:10.349
Great. That's great.

03:11.642 --> 03:13.143
- Valerie?
- What?

03:13.227 --> 03:15.437
- Could you release the hounds?
- No.

03:15.521 --> 03:16.647
- No?
- No.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.275
I'm gonna send in another tech
to do your side angles.

03:19.358 --> 03:21.944
Might as well finish what you started.

04:22.171 --> 04:23.380
Oh.

04:38.437 --> 04:40.689
OK, let's make this quick.

04:40.773 --> 04:42.816
It's fucking hot out here.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.445
- Don't you love coffee?
- Yes, I do.

04:46.528 --> 04:49.740
I love coffee, slept with Peter,
just like you.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.742
We must be long-lost twins.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.538
I have those same earrings at home.

04:55.621 --> 04:57.039
They're nice.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.707
How's... How's Tim doing?

04:58.791 --> 05:02.378
How do you think he's doing?
His father's dead.

05:02.419 --> 05:06.090
I have boys, too. Two boys. Dead father.

05:06.173 --> 05:10.928
Heart attack, though, not,
well, however Peter died.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.639
Is Tim seeing a grief counsellor?

05:13.722 --> 05:16.934
Shane went. I don't know if it did anything.

05:16.976 --> 05:19.436
- I guess time and...
- You know, this is my break,

05:19.520 --> 05:22.898
and you are not my friend,
so why am I sitting here?

05:22.982 --> 05:25.067
Don't you want to talk about Peter?

05:25.150 --> 05:29.071
Not with some random woman
he was fucking, who my son hates.

05:29.154 --> 05:33.117
You know, I used to think that it was
because he wanted Peter and me to reconcile,

05:33.200 --> 05:38.581
but now I'm thinking it's because
you're a crazy, stalker, narcissist whack job.

05:41.917 --> 05:44.169
I started sketching again.

05:44.628 --> 05:46.755
Jesus, I do sound nuts.

05:46.839 --> 05:47.840
I'm not.

05:49.466 --> 05:52.261
You're right, this is all ridiculous.

05:52.344 --> 05:55.306
I don't know what I expected. I'm sorry.

05:55.389 --> 05:59.310
Nice meeting you.
Even though you are kind of a bitch.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.728
Bye.

06:04.690 --> 06:08.527
Here. You can throw it away
if you want, OK? Bye.

06:21.498 --> 06:25.377
I have two questions.
One, why isn't the air conditioning on?

06:25.461 --> 06:26.795
I don't think it's working.

06:26.879 --> 06:31.050
OK. And, Shane,
can I play brick breaker on this thing?

06:31.133 --> 06:33.344
Those are for business purposes only.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.889
Sanjay, your territories are
junior colleges, trade schools...

06:36.972 --> 06:40.935
And gay bars and dance clubs,
cos I'm a faggot.

06:41.018 --> 06:44.855
I can call myself that, but you can't,
cos I'm gay and you're not.

06:44.939 --> 06:48.234
- I'm not ashamed. This is who I am.
- Good for you.

06:48.317 --> 06:51.362
I'll sell to anyone cool
who wants some weed. I'm flexy.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.448
Don't be too flexy.
We start with people we've dealt to before

06:54.532 --> 06:57.034
and only expand
when a customer has been vouched for.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.662
You're forgetting one key territory.

06:59.745 --> 07:03.082
- Hi, Silas. I'm gay.
- You can get help for that.

07:03.165 --> 07:08.629
Oh, I know. This guy Stewart's
been really helping me. Stewart's the best.

07:08.712 --> 07:11.507
Silas, why don't we talk about this
after Tara goes home?

07:11.590 --> 07:14.093
This is about Tara. Hear me out.

07:14.802 --> 07:20.432
Tara is completely active in the Church,
and they have, like, 10,000 members.

07:20.516 --> 07:22.226
It's a totally untapped market.

07:22.309 --> 07:27.815
They say when Christ was anointed with oil
by John the Baptist, it was cannabis oil.

07:27.898 --> 07:30.693
Wow, that sounds hot.

07:30.776 --> 07:33.237
The Lord wants me to sell pot, Mrs Botwin.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.738
- Really?
- Yes.

07:34.822 --> 07:39.535
And he also wants me to buy a new BMW.
Preferably the convertible.

07:39.618 --> 07:43.247
The good Christian people of Majestic
like to get baked.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.874
That explains so much.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.960
Shane, would you get that, please?

07:48.043 --> 07:52.047
So, am I in? I promise I'm gonna be
your number-one sales person.

07:54.425 --> 07:56.051
- Straight commission.
- Fine.

07:56.135 --> 07:57.887
Never say where you get your product.

07:57.970 --> 08:00.764
You realise you're doing something illegal?

08:00.848 --> 08:03.350
I answer to a much higher authority.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.731
Fine, you're in.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.068
Do I get a cell phone, too?

08:13.193 --> 08:14.695
- Take Silas'.
- What?

08:14.778 --> 08:16.864
Then how am I supposed
to cover my territory?

08:16.947 --> 08:19.950
Delivery requires discretion,
which you clearly lack.

08:20.034 --> 08:22.286
I'm gonna think of something else for you to do.

08:22.369 --> 08:26.707
Someone named Valerie is here.
She says she wants to talk to you.

08:29.752 --> 08:31.170
What am I doing here?

08:31.253 --> 08:32.379
Erm...

08:33.297 --> 08:36.508
I wanted to apologise
for acting like an asshole.

08:37.259 --> 08:39.053
No, that was fair.

08:39.135 --> 08:40.929
I mean, I did stalk you.

08:43.097 --> 08:48.229
Tim's in the car. I got your address
from your mammogram papers, drove over.

08:48.312 --> 08:50.272
Drove by the house a few times.

08:50.356 --> 08:54.151
Your neighbour on the corner
is really into gnomes, huh?

08:54.235 --> 08:58.197
- Did you call before and hang up?
- Twice.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.741
- Crazy stalker person.
- Call it even?

09:00.824 --> 09:05.579
No, I'm having you arrested.
Restraining order, the whole thing.

09:05.663 --> 09:09.250
Little shit. All right, look, I got you this.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.710
It's a bath bomb. Effervescent.

09:11.794 --> 09:14.838
My advice is to let it bubble
between your legs.

09:14.922 --> 09:18.842
The carbonation effect, it's really enjoyable.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.928
And it smells nice.

09:21.637 --> 09:24.098
- Thanks...
- Just take it. I'm an over-gifter.

09:24.181 --> 09:26.642
- Not a big deal.
- Oh, well...

09:27.685 --> 09:30.145
I'm gonna go.

09:30.229 --> 09:31.897
Thanks for the bath thing.

09:31.981 --> 09:35.276
Oh, and your boobs are fine. Benign.

09:35.359 --> 09:37.194
Fine and benign.

09:37.486 --> 09:39.697
Aren't you glad I'm not a proctologist?

09:39.780 --> 09:44.410
Well, you have short fingernails
but a lot of anger, so...

09:45.578 --> 09:49.456
OK, I'm gonna go smack my kid
and take him to the shrink.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.458
Oh, hey, erm...

09:53.168 --> 09:55.379
Are you free for dinner tomorrow?

09:55.421 --> 09:58.007
The referendum will pass.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.928
- I'm tense.
- Ooh, you want a massage?

10:03.012 --> 10:04.221
Yes.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.517
In Maui. A week in Wailea
with you when this is all over.

10:08.601 --> 10:12.646
- What do you say?
- I say I'm one lucky girl.

10:19.194 --> 10:20.779
Hello.

10:20.863 --> 10:21.989
Isabelle.

10:23.616 --> 10:25.659
How in the hell should I know where he is?

10:25.743 --> 10:28.204
Have you tried his cell phone?

10:29.455 --> 10:33.334
Well, maybe you should
call child protective services.

10:33.417 --> 10:37.421
No, I'm sure he's fine.
God protects the stupid.

10:48.641 --> 10:51.227
I'm not feeling any cold air.
I think it's broken.

10:51.310 --> 10:53.938
OK, when a customer calls
into the computer database,

10:54.021 --> 10:56.857
- he or she types in a client ID number.
- It's not working.

10:56.941 --> 10:58.525
You haven't even tried it.

10:58.609 --> 11:02.154
No, the air conditioning.
I don't think it's working.

11:05.407 --> 11:09.870
- OK, we need to talk.
- Bet your ass we do.

11:09.954 --> 11:11.580
Where's Tara?

11:11.664 --> 11:13.582
At her youth group. She's coming by later.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.626
I'm in the middle of explaining this to you.

11:15.709 --> 11:19.588
Praying that when the time comes,
they'll have a BMW in the colour she wants?

11:19.672 --> 11:22.508
- What's your problem?
- I guess we'll go over it later.

11:22.591 --> 11:26.470
Honey, I'm sorry. Go eat some cake
or watch YouTube or something.

11:26.554 --> 11:28.639
Were you trying to impress her?

11:28.722 --> 11:31.976
The bad-boy drug dealer
who drives all the good girls wild?

11:32.059 --> 11:36.063
It's not like that.
She is totally, totally trustworthy.

11:36.146 --> 11:39.483
And you would know this how?
You met her three weeks ago.

11:39.567 --> 11:41.068
In your 17 years on Earth

11:41.151 --> 11:43.988
you've gained such great insight
and wisdom into people?

11:44.071 --> 11:47.825
- She's gonna make a lot of money for us.
- We know nothing about her

11:47.908 --> 11:50.995
except that she's a fundamentalist
who likes to smoke pot.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.165
That does not inspire me with confidence.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.501
You married a DEA agent.

11:57.585 --> 11:59.879
Also monumentally stupid.

11:59.962 --> 12:03.632
I would hope that my children
could learn from my mistakes.

12:03.674 --> 12:05.426
I'd like my phone back.

12:05.509 --> 12:08.387
No. As I told you before,
I have other plans for you.

12:08.470 --> 12:10.389
You're coming with me to the grow house.

12:10.472 --> 12:13.142
Should I be excited about this,
or is this punishment?

12:13.225 --> 12:17.271
This is a way to learn about a business
from the ground up, literally.

12:17.354 --> 12:20.482
This is also a way
to keep you occupied so you don't go off

12:20.566 --> 12:23.485
and do something else stupid. Get it?

13:13.994 --> 13:18.541
Just a little something
to say thank you for all your help.

13:18.624 --> 13:19.750
Oh!

13:22.044 --> 13:26.173
- Look at that.
- 90 fucking percent of the vote, baby.

13:30.970 --> 13:34.306
- I'm not gonna answer that.
- It might be important.

13:34.390 --> 13:39.562
Everything that's important...
is right here in this room.

13:50.364 --> 13:53.826
It's your daughter.
Tell her you're busy till tomorrow.

13:53.909 --> 13:57.413
Then we can eat and fuck all day
without interruption.

13:58.873 --> 14:00.165
What?

14:01.667 --> 14:05.754
I can't understand anything that you're say...
Stop crying.

14:05.838 --> 14:09.466
Isabelle, stop crying and talk!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.685
Son of a bitch.

14:30.321 --> 14:36.035
Will you drop the Steel Magnolias bit?
He's still breathing.

14:36.118 --> 14:38.370
Why are you such a cunt?

14:39.246 --> 14:43.667
Please don't use foul language, Isabelle.
People will think you weren't raised right.

14:43.751 --> 14:45.002
I wonder why.

14:45.961 --> 14:48.172
Ow! Stop! Ow!

14:48.255 --> 14:49.506
Stop!

14:50.507 --> 14:53.969
- Good afternoon, Mrs Hodes.
- Yeah, for who?

14:54.637 --> 14:57.973
- Is he going to be OK?
- He's lucky to be alive.

14:58.057 --> 15:01.185
Animal urine disinfected
many of his wounds.

15:04.146 --> 15:06.690
- Animals peed on him?
- Apparently, several.

15:06.774 --> 15:09.652
Well, that's somehow perfect.

15:10.444 --> 15:13.656
He's gonna be all right, though, right?

15:13.739 --> 15:16.492
The initial surgery was successful,
but he'll need more.

15:16.575 --> 15:20.079
Then there will be a tremendous
amount of rehabilitation needed.

15:20.162 --> 15:22.623
We're looking down a long road here,
Mrs Hodes.

15:22.706 --> 15:26.627
No, not we. Him and you. Not me.

15:26.710 --> 15:30.256
- We are getting a divorce.
- So, who should I speak to?

15:30.339 --> 15:33.759
- There's no one else.
- There has to be someone else.

15:33.842 --> 15:38.639
He was an only child.
Grandma and Grandpa are dead.

15:38.722 --> 15:42.768
- There's no one else but you.
- Well, what about the state?

15:42.851 --> 15:48.649
I'm sure there must be some lovely,
state-funded institutions that will take him.

15:50.359 --> 15:54.071
- Dad.
- Oh, God.

15:55.739 --> 15:57.366
Come on! Move it!

15:59.326 --> 16:02.246
What's going on, Dwight?
Just open the gate.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.249
Doug Wilson. Councilman Doug.
I'm here every day.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.002
Don't you remember I wore
that pompom hat the other day?

16:08.085 --> 16:10.629
You loved that hat. Yeah, you did.

16:20.139 --> 16:22.683
What?
This is letting the air conditioning escape.

16:22.766 --> 16:25.519
The computer says
your membership's been revoked.

16:25.603 --> 16:27.813
What? By who?

16:27.897 --> 16:31.025
I don't know, but it's in red,
so it's from pretty high up.

16:31.108 --> 16:34.612
- You have to turn your car around.
- No. I'm not moving.

16:34.737 --> 16:38.115
Sullivan Groff and this whole
fucking place can kiss my black ass.

16:39.491 --> 16:44.163
- This is so not over.
- I'm sorry, sir. I did like your pompom hat.

16:44.246 --> 16:46.707
Save yourself.
You're too good for these assholes.

16:46.790 --> 16:50.461
Go get a job you'd be proud of.
We'll see who laughs last.

16:51.462 --> 16:55.549
- Conrad, teach him to grow.
- This little fucker?

16:56.133 --> 16:59.595
No, hold up. OK, no,
this little fucker steals our shit,

16:59.678 --> 17:01.805
and I'm supposed to be his mentor?

17:01.889 --> 17:07.560
Yes, think of it as a Big Brother
kind of thing, or Scared Straight.

17:07.645 --> 17:10.606
He needs a positive male influence in his life.

17:10.689 --> 17:13.525
- And I'm the only man you know?
- The only real man.

17:13.608 --> 17:16.403
- You think this shit is gonna fly with me?
- It's not shit.

17:16.487 --> 17:20.950
You're the best at what you do. I mean that.

17:22.159 --> 17:26.121
Hey, watch this right here.
Your mother's smooth as butter.

17:26.204 --> 17:27.289
Not always.

17:27.373 --> 17:29.291
Silas, your only lines are,

17:29.375 --> 17:34.380
"Yes, I'm willing to do anything you say,"
and, "Thank you for this opportunity. "

17:35.714 --> 17:38.759
So how much are you paying me
to baby-sit?

17:38.842 --> 17:41.136
- Pay you?
- That is what I'm doing.

17:41.220 --> 17:44.306
You can't handle him
so you're giving him to me to set him straight.

17:44.390 --> 17:46.183
- $10 an hour.
- Don't be cheap with me.

17:46.267 --> 17:48.269
The going rate is closer to $15 in the suburbs.

17:48.352 --> 17:50.854
After business is up and running,
I'll buy you a Rolex.

17:50.896 --> 17:53.983
Because all black men
like a little bling-bling?

17:54.066 --> 17:55.693
Yes.

17:55.776 --> 17:57.611
Go on.

17:57.695 --> 18:00.072
Make my boy your bitch.

18:05.035 --> 18:08.205
All right, Nancy,
you want your boy to be my bitch?

18:12.960 --> 18:14.879
He'll be my bitch.

18:16.505 --> 18:20.634
Poor guy. Poor wrecked guy.

18:29.059 --> 18:30.895
OK, tell me she gave you a sponge bath.

18:30.978 --> 18:34.607
She soaped it up
and then slurped the gobbledygoop.

18:34.648 --> 18:38.277
Blink once for yes, two for no, three for hell yes.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.571
Oh, God!

18:41.405 --> 18:44.700
Listen, buddy, you don't have
to worry about anything.

18:44.783 --> 18:47.119
Buddy Doug here has got your back.

18:47.161 --> 18:49.455
Now, in case you turn into a vegetable,

18:49.538 --> 18:52.917
I've taken the liberty of
drawing up this power of attorney.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.837
You need to sign this now,
or your cunt wife will crush the one part of you

18:56.921 --> 18:59.757
that hasn't already been crushed. All right?

18:59.840 --> 19:02.009
Just try to work with me here.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.431
Sign your name.

19:08.265 --> 19:09.892
There we go.

19:09.975 --> 19:12.811
OK. Your assets are protected.
I speak for you now.

19:12.895 --> 19:14.563
Do you have any assets?

19:15.773 --> 19:18.901
You got your MILF money coming to you
. Nance is back in business.

19:18.984 --> 19:21.946
Conrad's got a grow house three times the size.

19:21.987 --> 19:24.907
Money's flowing in like
this morphine in your arm.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.116
Huh.

19:30.037 --> 19:32.706
Just a little while. Share the love?

19:32.790 --> 19:35.376
Are you out of your fucking mind?

19:35.459 --> 19:37.795
He might have a disease.

19:37.878 --> 19:41.882
Let's see if there's any clean needles.
Then we'll just pull the tube.

19:41.966 --> 19:45.719
Fair enough. I could use a little something.
It's so hard to see him like this.

19:45.803 --> 19:49.723
- Think he'll be in pain if we take the drip out?
- No, he'll be fine. Right, buddy?

19:49.765 --> 19:52.726
You are such a good friend.
We love you, man.

19:52.851 --> 19:54.812
- What?
- Bingo.

19:55.771 --> 19:58.399
Does this mean we can't go to Hawaii?

19:58.482 --> 20:02.653
No, this means I have to sell
the Majestic house,

20:02.736 --> 20:08.117
and then I have to pay for someone else
to take care of the magnificent invalid.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.995
Baby, you can't sell the Majestic house.

20:11.078 --> 20:13.247
What can I do? I need the money.

20:13.330 --> 20:17.334
No, seriously, you can't sell it.
The mortgage is held by a dummy corporation.

20:17.418 --> 20:21.630
You can live in it for as long as you want,
but if you try to sell it, the jig's up.

20:21.714 --> 20:25.009
- You'll go to jail for accepting a bribe.
- Shit.

20:25.092 --> 20:27.136
Can you sell it for me?

20:27.261 --> 20:30.764
- I thought Dean was out of your life.
- He was.

20:30.848 --> 20:33.392
Until the handitard went and drove off of a cliff.

20:33.517 --> 20:37.521
You'll think of something. You're a very
resourceful woman, Celia Hodes.

20:43.736 --> 20:48.282
- Fucking rolling blackouts.
- The planet's over-populated.

20:48.365 --> 20:52.244
Resources are running out. The world is...

20:54.455 --> 20:56.081
It's doomed.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.753
- More wine?
- Oh, God, yeah.

21:05.466 --> 21:07.218
I have to sit down.

21:14.642 --> 21:18.812
When Shane was little,
he called the stars "up aboves. "

21:20.898 --> 21:24.985
- I miss the simplicity of toddlerhood.
- Amen to that.

21:30.282 --> 21:32.201
I'm failing my children.

21:33.452 --> 21:36.288
Oh, God. Who isn't?

21:40.584 --> 21:41.877
Yeah.

21:41.961 --> 21:43.671
Tim's kind of a dickhead.

21:44.755 --> 21:48.300
- Fuck you. I love my son.
- Oh, sorry, of course you do.

21:49.552 --> 21:51.595
I love my dickhead son.

21:57.184 --> 22:02.606
- I have ice-cream cake.
- I want cake. Give me cake.

22:02.690 --> 22:04.984
- Give me cake!
- Cake!

22:05.067 --> 22:08.404
Someone's yelling,
and people are sleeping.

22:08.487 --> 22:11.031
How drunk are we?

22:11.115 --> 22:13.909
- We're not drunk, Andy. We're...
- Lubricated.

22:13.993 --> 22:17.788
- Is that the technical term?
- You got a problem with that?

22:17.872 --> 22:20.416
- No, ma'am.
- He called me ma'am.

22:20.499 --> 22:22.710
Get him, Val, get him.

22:22.793 --> 22:24.837
You think I'm a ma'am?

22:27.798 --> 22:30.801
You are definitely not a ma'am. No, ma'am.

22:30.885 --> 22:35.556
I'm getting cake and three forks,
and no one can stop me.

22:37.016 --> 22:38.601
Thank you.

22:43.188 --> 22:46.066
- You getting up?
- No, I'm fine down here.

22:46.150 --> 22:47.776
Who's your friend?

22:48.611 --> 22:52.531
- Do you like her?
- She's... Who is she?

22:52.615 --> 22:55.701
- She's my new friend.
- About time you got a friend.

22:55.784 --> 23:00.706
Oh, not nice, Andy. Not a nice thing to say.

23:00.789 --> 23:02.917
So, how do you know her?

23:04.084 --> 23:06.170
She's Peter's ex-wife.

23:09.173 --> 23:13.219
I'm sorry, Nance. Are you fucking insane?

23:13.302 --> 23:15.387
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:16.513 --> 23:21.894
You know, it's funny, but if we don't
succeed in life, we run the risk of failure.

23:22.811 --> 23:25.189
It's not pollution that's causing problems.

23:25.272 --> 23:27.608
It's the impurities in the air and in the water.

23:27.691 --> 23:30.361
So I say to you, my fellow Majesticans,

23:30.444 --> 23:33.239
change is good

23:33.322 --> 23:36.033
because change is change.

23:42.790 --> 23:43.791
Thank you very much.

23:43.874 --> 23:48.462
God bless you,
and God bless the new Majestic!

23:52.591 --> 23:53.968
Thank you!

24:11.735 --> 24:13.237
Holy shit.

24:15.614 --> 24:18.409
Wow, that's a lot of sewage.

24:30.212 --> 24:33.507
<i># Buttmachine,

24:33.591 --> 24:38.596

24:38.679 --> 24:39.763
