Previously on "12 Monkeys "...

00:02.836 --> 00:06.499
Every time | splinter, it feels like I'm
being ripped apart from the inside.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.499
Time, it's going to take what it's owed.

00:09.635 --> 00:13.674
I'm still holding on to the memory
of her, trapped in that tiny room,

00:13.805 --> 00:15.966
holding on to her dead little hand.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.053
That's your little girl?

00:19.186 --> 00:20.767
That's what this is for you?

00:20.896 --> 00:23.683
Your daughter is the past.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.978
This treatment was a temporary solution
for your condition.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.486
We are out of time.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.273
Splinter Mr Cole to 2015.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.564
- We could lose him forever!
- We have to!

00:33.700 --> 00:35.656
Cole.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.572
They've been one step ahead
the whole way.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.035
I know who the witness is.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.992
- Aaron Marker?
- Who are you?

00:41.124 --> 00:43.080
Dr Railly is very important.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.826
What are you willing to do
to keep her alive?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.919
I can protect you now.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.209
I wanna be a daughter again.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.587
Goines.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.971
You wanna see
what a paradox looks like?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.220
Whatjust happened?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.428
Mother nature doesn't like it when you
rearrange her furniture.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.268
Take this. Keep it to yourself.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.850
- What is it?
- It's why I brought you here.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.894
Your life depends on it.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.618
ADLER: There's no sign of Cole's tracer.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.958
We had it in 2015 for a moment,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.794
but there's been nothing
in more than 24 hours.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.958
Stop looking.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.628
But if Mr Cole did
splinter successfully...

01:33.760 --> 01:34.795
He did.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.546
Mr Cole barely made it alive to 1987.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.589
You saw what condition he was in,

01:40.767 --> 01:43.850
and that was before
the splinter to 2015.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.470
God knows what further damage that did.

01:46.607 --> 01:51.021
He survived... but he won't come back.

01:51.194 --> 01:55.733
So... that's all?
Wejust abandon him there?

02:01.955 --> 02:06.164
I'm afraid it is we who are abandoned...
Dr Adler.

02:09.296 --> 02:13.881
So, Cole is just a memory now.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.750
As the past was intended to be.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.092
This morning, yesterday... or 30 years,

02:21.224 --> 02:23.806
it's all just a million
firing neurons...

02:25.937 --> 02:27.393
...given meaning by the human mind.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.690
We'll all be there eventually.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.481
I return

02:38.659 --> 02:41.992
Seems a long time

02:43.830 --> 02:47.994
We seem like old times

02:54.007 --> 02:56.498
When we are in New York,
we speak English.

02:56.635 --> 02:57.715
I need the practice.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.425
Your English is fine.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.885
I don't understand why you want to
work in an American laboratory anyway,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.678
just because your husband...

03:05.811 --> 03:07.301
It has nothing to do with my husband.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.689
Raritan Valley is the only facility
in the world

03:09.815 --> 03:11.555
focused on quantum splintering.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.187
I thought you'd be proud of me.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.359
I am, Kat.
| just wish it weren't so far away.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.774
Your mother and I
miss having you in Berlin,

03:21.952 --> 03:23.692
and with your medical training,
you...

03:23.829 --> 03:27.117
I'm not interested in medicine.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.286
- I'm not good with people.
- If you'd only try.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.331
Our bodies were built to die.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.545
Why should I waste my research
trying to heal them

03:35.674 --> 03:37.130
when I can put it to such better use?

03:37.259 --> 03:39.796
Better use than prolonging human life?

03:39.928 --> 03:42.761
If your prototypes,
though I barely understand them,

03:42.889 --> 03:47.633
can prevent the effects of time
on human cells at a molecular level,

03:47.769 --> 03:49.430
think of the possibilities.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.894
What aren't you telling me?
Did Elliott...?

03:55.026 --> 03:56.766
Please, let's not discuss my ex-husband.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.645
Past is past. It was a mistake.

03:59.781 --> 04:04.366
Falling in love is never a mistake.
Love can't be calculated or predicted.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.325
Which is why
I don't have any use for it.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.071
You can't live by science alone.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.449
It's the heart, not the mind,
that sustains us.

Goodnight, Papa.

- I love you.

- Maybe dying.
- Who?

You are probably looking for my mother.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.050
I'm not that kind of a doctor,
I'm a physicist.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.842
Please listen to me. We need to talk.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.182
Well, maybe you call my office
in the morning.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.468
There is no time.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.063
If you don't help me, Cole will die.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.682
And I won't let that happen.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.389
JONES:
Time, it's going to take what it's owed.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.282
Cole?

06:14.416 --> 06:15.371

From my time.

06:35.854 --> 06:39.312
- DR RAILLY: Is anyone else here?
- No. Not any more.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.227
OK. Get in here.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.351
- You're the only one who can help us.
- I can't.

- Stop.

Look.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.124
Where did you get these?

07:01.254 --> 07:04.212
No, this can't be real.

This is my work.

In the future,
this will all be very, very real.

- COLE: Where's Cassie?
- I don't know.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.806
She sewed up your wound and she left.
Said she had to get help.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.094
- What kind of help?
- She wouldn't tell me.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.685
She doesn't tell me much any more.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.474
Just... that all this splintering
is killing you.

- Does he have a pulse?
- Uh...

08:08.029 --> 08:11.021
- No, no, there's nothing.
- OK, he's in cardiac arrest.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.024
He needs Epinephrine. Go into
the kitchen and get my medical bag.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.152

in a gray box.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.327
Cassie, how do I do this?

OK, it's time for you to go.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.993
- I have a gun.
- Yes.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.035
But I have a knife, and unlike
your gun, my knife is real.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.964
I'm sorry. |just thought...

09:15.096 --> 09:19.180
This technology, it's not published.
It's just a theory.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.176
It's a prototype serum
that I designed for Project: Splinter.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.395
Just the one. It's not possible.

09:25.523 --> 09:29.983
But my friend,
and one day, your... your friend...

09:31.112 --> 09:34.400
...is from the future,
where it is possible.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.774

sent him here.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.493

I wouldn't exactly call
what you were doing sleeping.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.318
I've seen boxing matches
that looked more restful.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.696
Yeah, well, where I come from,
sleep's dangerous.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.949
It's when you're
at your most vulnerable.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.827
But you survived. That's something.

Maybe now that we know
that the plague is coming...

10:33.967 --> 10:37.175

we can prepare.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.382
- Work to survive it.
- Maybe.

cut off from everyone, everything.

You've always known me.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.313
It appears so.

11:39.949 --> 11:44.067
But maybe your always
and my always are not the same.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.569
Why didn't you tell me?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.912
I'm sure I had my reasons.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.868
- I need blood samples.
- (SIGHS) You don't change, do you?

11:54.339 --> 11:56.125
I'll need a microscope.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.794
Uh, there's one upstairs,
in the office.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.418
I'II draw a fresh blood sample.

12:03.932 --> 12:07.971
Come on. You need to lie down.
Come here.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.930
- COLE: How'd you convince her?
- The way you taught me.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.227
With a gun. And the truth.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.359
Gun? I thought you flew to New York.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.400
I did. The gun was a toy.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.193
You shouldn't have brought her here.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.816
The risk to the timeline, it's too...

12:24.953 --> 12:26.864
I didn't tell her much.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.612
Besides, you're dying. And she can help.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.614
I die, you die.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.913
Nothing anyone can do will change that.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.999
I got Jones here, didn't I?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.038
Jones is here
because she's always come here.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.335
It's fate.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.293
There's no such thing as fate.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.593

of what we don't have,

13:04.617 --> 13:08.360
but that has never stopped us before,
and it will not stop us now.

we need to rebuild our investigation.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.865
We can't. We lost
practically everything in the fire.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.037
We can.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.789
And we will.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.708
We're not giving up.
Start with our own archives.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.417
- Here. Remount the storage drive.
- This is madness.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.586
Just blindly forward?

13:26.723 --> 13:30.011
Well, forward is the only direction
available at the moment.

on the 12 Monkeys.

Markridge, Goines,
Oliver Peters, Dr Railly.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.400
Dig deep. No detail is too small.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.696
Markridge was making
significant political contributions.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.781
This is from Washington Dulles.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.822
Judging by the pattern
of viral dissemination,

13:50.955 --> 13:52.491
it would suggest air travel.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.660
The CDC's original report
was signed by Dr Railly.

There was a break-in in this laboratory
late November.

were never solved.

the vanishing of Dr Peters.

14:27.617 --> 14:32.611
These things subjected us
to substantial economic gravity.

And we are quite frankly
hemorrhaging trust.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.120
What the hell is this?

14:45.134 --> 14:50.094
A takeover. Hostile.
An embarrassing takeover. Move.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.347
Jennifer, what are you doing?

14:53.476 --> 14:54.591
He's right about trust.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.558
If I can be frank for a moment?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.769
Never trust a man
with an offshore account

14:58.898 --> 15:01.059
and a mid-size chubby for redheads.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.025
- This is ridiculous.
- (SCOFFS) Embezzlement?

15:05.154 --> 15:06.530
Infidelity?

15:06.656 --> 15:09.113
Fﬁendo,
you're first mate on the Titanic

15:09.283 --> 15:11.274
and you're filling up life boats
with caviar.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.494
Here. It's your resignation.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.285
As majority shareholder,
pursuant to dear Daddy,

15:18.418 --> 15:22.787
I am exercising my right, as outlined
in article bIah, subsection yadda,

15:22.922 --> 15:26.005
to hostilely take you bitches over.
(LAUGHS)

15:26.134 --> 15:27.169
Security.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.174
Security.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.926
Security?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.044
Security...

15:32.181 --> 15:33.717
...works for me now.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.595
Crazy ironic. (GASPS)

15:36.727 --> 15:39.434
Raise your hand
if you would like to be the new him.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.937
Done. Meet the new boss.

15:42.066 --> 15:47.777
Same as... absolutely nothing at all.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.520
You're insane.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.488
- (CHUCKLES)
- You should be locked up.

15:51.659 --> 15:55.493
Charges were dropped. New evidence.
I've been set free!

15:55.621 --> 15:57.202
- I've been...
- Released.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.366
- No.
- Let loose?

15:58.499 --> 15:59.614
- No.
- Un-caged?

15:59.750 --> 16:00.739
Yes! That.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.914
Un-caged. (CHUCKLES, GROWLS)

16:04.088 --> 16:06.795
And I'm never, ever going back.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.007
OK, Markridge, listen up.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.336
I've got some ideas.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.011
Did you find anything?

16:18.144 --> 16:21.136
Comparing this sample
to what you showed me in New York...

16:21.647 --> 16:23.933
...it's as you feared,
he's getting worse.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.522
Mr Cole is going to die.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.741
He's not just a friend.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.745
He's more to you. Much more.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.207
- How did you meet him?
- I told you.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.790
They found a recording
that I make and...

16:48.341 --> 16:52.084
...the future you sent him here
to find me.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.462
- And you believed his story?
- No.

16:55.598 --> 17:01.685
He brought my watch with him
from the future, and he broke time.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.896
- The same watch from his time?
- Yes.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.987
- That's profoundly risky.
- I know.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.279
It caused a paradox.
It almost killed us.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.568
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.489
Mother Nature doesn't like it
if you rearrange her furniture.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.452
Right.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.919
That must have been
extraordinary to see.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.289
Matter coming in contact with itself.

17:32.468 --> 17:37.132
Wait, just a moment. Uh...
When was Mr Cole born?

17:37.265 --> 17:41.508
Uh... 2009, Ithink. Why?

17:43.187 --> 17:46.850
Splintering has corrupted his genetic
composition at a molecular level.

17:46.983 --> 17:51.727
But if his current DNA were introduced
to his original molecular structure,

17:51.862 --> 17:53.818
it might undo the quantum shifting.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.406
A paradox. To save his life.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.407
Possible.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.949
We could get a blood sample
from the original Cole.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.866
- That might work.

- This isn't my fight.
- Of course it is.

18:24.478 --> 18:28.596
No. No.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.976
See, while you're busy saving Cole
and the rest of mankind,

18:33.112 --> 18:35.774
someone has to figure out
how to save you.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.212
It's Aaron Marker.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.178
I wanna make a deal.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.928
I don't pretend to understand
what you're doing, or why,

19:09.065 --> 19:12.398
but I am a pragmatist.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.069
Right? A realist.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.777
You have to be
to survive in Washington.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.239
Survival is everything.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.529
This isn't just about me.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.826
- It's Cassie. Dr Railly.
- Of course.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.667
How's it going to work?

19:29.710 --> 19:32.372
Where are we going to go?
I need to know the details.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.377
I'm notjust gonna
take your word for it.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.833

19:51.023 --> 19:53.935
Why would you feel shame
over what you were built to do?

19:54.777 --> 19:56.563
To endure.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.977
To thrive.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.527
Because it's wrong.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.364
No. This is not a moral compromise.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.079
It's primal, elemental.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.786
Magnificent.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.039
Darwin himself would be proud.

20:18.175 --> 20:22.339
Darwin?
I missed his treatise on genocide.

20:22.471 --> 20:26.305
Devolution, Mr Marker, takes many forms.

20:28.561 --> 20:33.146
Promise me Cassie and I will be safe.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.691
That all depends.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.857
- On what?
- You.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.828
Found the name James William Cole
in the social security database.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.743
Birth dates match. Father's Matthew.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.125
There's a Matthew Cole
who owns a garage about an hour away.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.415
Might be his dad.

- I'm more worried about prison.

for a sample of his son's blood?

It'll be fine.

(LAUGHS) Yes, yes, the woman
who threatened me with a gun.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.849
We won't need a gun.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.105
Did you bring a real one this time?

21:20.154 --> 21:21.735
You're going to kidnap this boy?

21:22.740 --> 21:23.820

I have an appointment.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.639
- You're pregnant?
- For now.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.969
Recently, I was a married woman.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.262
For six days.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.677
Six.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.270
Then he left me.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.025
And now...
I want every part of him gone.

I'm looking for Matthew Cole.
Is this his garage?

23:48.344 --> 23:49.379
Yeah.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.671
I'm with the CDC.

23:50.846 --> 23:54.805
I don't know if you're aware, but there
have been several cases of E coli

23:54.934 --> 23:58.222
in the area recently,
likely from that supermarket.

23:58.354 --> 24:03.018
We have reason to believe Mr Cole,
or his family might have been exposed.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.606
I'm sorry, miss. Wrong guy.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.228
You're not Matthew Cole?

24:06.362 --> 24:09.775
No. Bill. B"! Anderson.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.443
Mr Cole owned this place before me.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.652
Do you know where I might find him?
Is there a forwarding address?

24:15.829 --> 24:17.956
Disappeared.
I haven't seen him for months.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.572
Good luck, though.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.200
Come on.

24:23.337 --> 24:27.876
- (CREAKING)
- Listen.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.137
James?

24:41.939 --> 24:43.224
Hello.

24:55.953 --> 24:58.035
Alright, you've got two minutes.
I gotta get back.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.996
OK, so you are Matthew Cole?

25:01.166 --> 25:05.000
I'm not usually the paranoid type.
The boy's mother was always...

25:05.129 --> 25:08.212
Well, let's just say that she gave me
a reason to worry about James.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.082
DR RAILLY: Of course. Protective
parents are perfectly natural.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.551
Dad? I can't get this to work.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.212
- Can you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.589
What word was that?
I don't think I heard you right.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.468
- I can't.
- We don't use that word around here.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.970
- The only failure...
- ls giving up.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.232
Exactly. Now, why don't you
work on that a little by yourself?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.736
And then I'll come help, OK?

25:30.863 --> 25:31.898
Good boy.

25:36.994 --> 25:40.612
- We're not here about E coli.
- Let's have it, then.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.207
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.370
Oh, God help us.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.422
You're gonna find this hard to believe.
It's just...

25:52.551 --> 25:55.008
Nearly impossible, I'd say.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.136
You need to leave.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.130
Please. I'm telling the truth.

That boy is the only thing
in this world matters to me.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.385

26:04.521 --> 26:06.261
No, no, no. It's not a game.
It's not a game.

- I think we should go. OK, let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

26:11.153 --> 26:15.271
It's real. All of it.
The virus, time travel.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.784
There's something called
the Army of the 12 Monkeys and...

26:17.951 --> 26:19.077
What did you say?

26:19.203 --> 26:22.240
The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.158
They're the ones behind the plague.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.705

- Who?

26:28.837 --> 26:30.122
Marian. The boy's mother!

Last time I saw her, she was
on about some... monkey army.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.667
Told me I had to protect him.

26:36.804 --> 26:41.844
Your son, the grown-up James Cole,
he needs you.

26:42.017 --> 26:46.056
Right. And who are you to him, exactly?

26:46.188 --> 26:49.601
Look... come with us.

26:50.651 --> 26:54.269
Look into his eyes.
If you don't see your son there,

26:54.404 --> 26:56.269
then you can leave,

26:56.406 --> 26:58.533
And we will not bother you again.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.858
Where the hell did that come from?

Have there been any power surges?

28:19.448 --> 28:20.654
Temporal activity of any kind?

28:20.782 --> 28:23.114
Just a small tachyon surge
in the middle of the night.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.201
- Nothing unusual.
- I want to know how they got here.

28:34.922 --> 28:37.504
- Is it like a shot?
- JONES: Yeah. Just like it.

28:37.633 --> 28:40.045
Except, instead of putting
something into your body,

28:40.219 --> 28:41.425
we're taking something out.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.508
Will it hurt?

28:42.638 --> 28:43.673
Nah, just a pinch.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.839
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Am I sick?

28:46.975 --> 28:50.138
No. You're helping somebody who is sick.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.057
- Your friend?
- Yes. My friend.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.349
Wait. Dr Railly?

29:01.573 --> 29:05.407
You'd better do this.
I'd hate to seal the fate of mankind

29:05.535 --> 29:08.368
because I can't find the vein
of a five-year-old.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.743
She's a really good doctor.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.206
OK...

29:19.341 --> 29:22.003
- Ah, ah.
- I know. I know. Almost done.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.296
- Are we done?
- Almost.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.683
- Ow!
- DR RAILLY: Alright.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.595
- Aah!
- Ow!

29:30.811 --> 29:34.349
Mr Cole, you have to keep
your distance from the boy.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.765
You can't get too close to yourself...
to James.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.607
That would be disastrous.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.853
Come here. There. There.

29:43.699 --> 29:44.734
There.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.322
Good job.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.114
Alright?

29:52.791 --> 29:54.327
Let me get some rest.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.293
And I'll sit with you.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.218
I have to say, boy saved my life.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.891
Before he came along,
I wasn't much of a man.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.393
You...

30:25.157 --> 30:26.897
You told me about my mother.

30:28.618 --> 30:32.827
I... didn't know her that well, Marian.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.747
I loved her like crazy, but...

30:36.960 --> 30:38.496
It was a short thing.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.836
I asked her to marry me, but...

30:42.883 --> 30:43.918
She wouldn't.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.960
I took off pretty soon after...

30:49.014 --> 30:50.675
...without saying much.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.682
My son.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.517
You.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.688
Told me she couldn't protect you.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.409
I never understood
what she was talking about.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.121
But I was grateful.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.999
Every day.

31:23.131 --> 31:27.374
He's a... he's a good boy.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.805
He won't always be.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.808
But I'm trying to make up for it.

31:39.147 --> 31:44.562
- I'm sorry... I can't...
- Hey. Don't use that word.

31:46.113 --> 31:50.823
- The only failure...
- ls giving up.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.277
Exactly.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.656
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, just trying to...

32:32.784 --> 32:34.024
I know. I know.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.869
I'm so sorry.

32:37.998 --> 32:42.788
You know, |just thought...
I'd be there for him... always.

32:44.379 --> 32:49.464
- This plague, it'll get me for sure?
- (PHONE RINGING)

32:49.593 --> 32:50.708
Excuse me.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.131
Aaron?

32:54.306 --> 32:56.922
AARON: Cass, come around the corner.
The parking lot. Quickly.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.053
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.564
Cass, please don't ask a lot of
questions, just get in the car.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.191
They're gonna win this.
They're gonna win this. You know that.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.404
Nothing changes!

33:17.579 --> 33:19.490
- Oh, my God, what did you do?
- Get in the car.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.825
- They wouldn't wait any longer, OK?
- What did you do?

33:21.958 --> 33:23.368
- Please.
- Aaron! Stop it!

33:27.714 --> 33:29.830
We can't stop it, Cass!

33:30.008 --> 33:31.748
You know I'm right!

34:45.458 --> 34:46.789
Get in the car, now!

35:00.932 --> 35:01.967
(GASPS)

35:11.693 --> 35:15.902
- Where is he?
- A step ahead of you, asshole.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.862
(CHUCKLES) I doubt it.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.309
You're just in time.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.847
Yes. It's over, Cole.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.223
I know.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.748
Cole?

37:07.350 --> 37:08.430
My father...

37:16.735 --> 37:19.147
- The boy?
- Yeah, I left him with Katarina.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.314
I didn't want him to see.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.320
It was Aaron.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.782
That's how they found us.

37:28.163 --> 37:32.623
- (SIRENS)
- We should go. Come on.

37:41.843 --> 37:44.630
JONES: He'll be safe here
with child protective services.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.722
You're throwing away your cigarettes?

37:49.851 --> 37:51.341
I've decided to keep the child.

37:51.478 --> 37:54.891
After all this,
maybe my father was right.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.183
Love is never a mistake.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.898
DR RAILLY: But the plague,
you might not have much time.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.480
I'm a scientist, Dr Railly,
I don't believe in fate.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.742
I could tell you, you know.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.745
Who those men were, everything.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.825
Give you a chance to do it differently,
give you a head start.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.998
It's tempting, but no.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.838
It's just as likely to undo your work
as it is to help mine.

38:23.009 --> 38:27.753
The causality of temporal physics
is unpredictable.

38:27.889 --> 38:29.925
And if it is fate
that our paths will cross again,

38:30.058 --> 38:32.174
then we'll find the answers together.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.934
But listen, Mr Cole,
you have to understand,

38:35.063 --> 38:39.022
the paradox has destroyed your
ability to travel back to your time.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.139
You live here now.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.482
I know.

38:43.154 --> 38:46.237
- Good bye for now, Mr Cole.
- Good bye, Katarina.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.495
We'll probably have
some more questions for you,

38:58.670 --> 39:00.752
but you just...
you play here for a while.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.915
OK.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.168
Are you sure we should leave him here?

39:08.304 --> 39:10.761
- Maybe I could see if...
- He'll be alright.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.673
He'll make friends.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.019
You OK, kid?

39:26.155 --> 39:27.986
Don't be scared. It's OK here.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.199
I'm Jose.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.778
I'll show you around.

39:57.937 --> 40:02.146
ADLER: I analyzed the plant.
It is ordinary hedera helix.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.310
English ivy.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.856
But why is it red?
Why is it growing on my machines?

40:06.988 --> 40:09.946
- There's barely any light here.
- Well, I have a theory.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.109
Yeah?

40:11.242 --> 40:15.201
I examined the isotopic Co2 composition
of the cell membrane.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.036
I'm not a botanist, Dr Adler.

40:17.916 --> 40:22.535
Nor am I. But based on my analysis,
this plant grew in an environment

40:22.670 --> 40:25.753
with significantly higher amounts
of greenhouse gases.

40:25.882 --> 40:30.592
- Meaning?
- This plant is not from our time.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.474
(ALARM SOUNDS)

40:47.320 --> 40:48.355
JONES: What's happened?

40:48.488 --> 40:50.103
It's Sergeant Whitley, ma'am.

40:56.913 --> 40:57.948
(GASPS)

41:01.960 --> 41:02.995
Good Lord.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.834
They're coming. They're coming.

41:45.086 --> 41:50.501
This facility...
what is inside is very important to us.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.130
Are you sure you can get us in?

42:01.602 --> 42:03.183
It'll be my pleasure.
