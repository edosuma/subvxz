WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:05.374
Look at him. Breaks my heart.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.672
<i>Poor little guy,
all alone.</i>

00:08.800 --> 00:09.415
I don't see why

00:09.635 --> 00:11.922
- his brother can't sit with him.<i>
- Come on, Mary.</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:13.173
When you were in high school,
would you have lunch

00:13.388 --> 00:14.924
- with a nine-year-old?
- Yes, I would've.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.347
Well, there's something
wrong with you.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.348
I'm gonna keep him company.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.801
Hey, hey, hey, Mary. Mary.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.886
Think this through.
Right now the kids

00:22.105 --> 00:23.437
<i>are just ignoring Sheldon.</i>

00:23.649 --> 00:25.641
What happens if he's
sitting with his mommy?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.892
They could mistake me
for a senior.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.191
Well, I look younger than you.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.030
Just give this time, all right?

00:33.242 --> 00:34.608
It'll work itself out.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.744
<i>My mother never understood</i>

00:37.955 --> 00:40.823
<i>that I actually enjoyed
being alone.</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:44.372
<i>Solitude allowed me to think
about important things,</i>

00:44.586 --> 00:46.873
<i>like the effect
of gravitational forces</i>

00:47.089 --> 00:48.876
<i>as you approach
an event horizon,</i>

00:50.425 --> 00:52.587
<i>as opposed
to less important things,</i>

00:52.803 --> 00:55.420
<i>like how many grapes my brother
can fit in his mouth.</i>

00:55.847 --> 00:56.633
14!

00:56.848 --> 00:58.464
Yeah!

00:59.351 --> 01:00.933
<i>Jean-Paul Sartre said,</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:03.306
<i>"Hell is other people."</i>

01:04.522 --> 01:07.015
<i>That's humorous
because it's true.</i>

01:32.884 --> 01:33.590
Something wrong?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.051
How come math is easy
for Sheldon

01:36.263 --> 01:37.424
and hard for me?

01:37.639 --> 01:38.425
I don't know, honey,

01:38.640 --> 01:40.256
but you have your own gifts.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.591
Like what?

01:41.810 --> 01:43.426
Well, like...

01:47.232 --> 01:49.098
...you have very pretty hair.

01:50.027 --> 01:50.858
True.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.483
Georgie.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.439
Would you do me
a little tiny favor?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.444
Like what?

01:57.659 --> 01:59.116
Tomorrow at lunch,
would you mind

01:59.328 --> 02:00.409
sitting with your brother?

02:00.621 --> 02:01.486
Don't do it, Georgie.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.116
You stay out of this.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.451
I ate with him in second grade.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.658
It really hurt my social life.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.455
Sorry, Mom. Can't do it.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.914
Why are you such a brat?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.254
Maybe I'm crying for attention.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.877
This isn't a joke, young lady.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.721
Yes, your brother
may be smart,

02:20.932 --> 02:22.639
but he doesn't have
a friend in the world.

02:22.851 --> 02:26.094
And I am sorry,
but I am very worried about him.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.314
Nice going. You're making Mom
a nervous wreck.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.977
What did I do?

02:35.197 --> 02:37.860
You don't have any friends,
and she is beside herself.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.407
But I'm fine without friends.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.904
<i>I don't know what to
tell you, Sheldon.</i>

02:41.119 --> 02:43.031
She said it's your fault.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.158
I'm going to watch <i>ALF.</i>

02:45.957 --> 02:47.118
<i>Science fact:</i>

02:47.334 --> 02:50.327

02:57.636 --> 02:58.592

02:59.012 --> 03:00.219
<i>getting from point "A"</i>

03:00.430 --> 03:03.468
<i>to point "B" can be
a harrowing experience.</i>

03:11.024 --> 03:14.017
<i>But it's worth it
when point "B" is...</i>

03:16.530 --> 03:17.941
<i>...the library.</i>

03:18.323 --> 03:21.236
<i>Home to the original

03:21.451 --> 03:23.158
<i>the Dewey Decimal System.</i>

03:23.370 --> 03:24.406
<i>Hey there, Sheldon.</i>

03:24.871 --> 03:26.203
What can I get for you today?

03:26.915 --> 03:27.951
Chemistry?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.203
Quantum mechanics? Astronomy?

03:30.502 --> 03:31.868
No, nothing fun today.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.919
I need to learn
how to make a friend.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.622
Aw, honey,
you having a hard time

03:35.841 --> 03:37.127
adjusting to high school?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.755
I'm having a hard time
adjusting to Earth.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.052
Yeah. You and me both.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.512
<i>Try this.</i>

03:46.727 --> 03:49.435
It's been around a while,
but it's still quite popular.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.270
Unlike me,

03:51.690 --> 03:53.306
who's just been around a while.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.185
<i>"How to Win Friends</i>

03:58.405 --> 04:00.021

04:02.409 --> 04:03.741
"Principle one.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.288
Hello, George.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.000
What?

04:18.216 --> 04:21.425
I do admire
your thick head of hair...

04:21.720 --> 04:22.460
George.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.628
Thanks.

04:26.016 --> 04:26.802
What's going on?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.475
Well, I'm practicing
the principles in this book.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.303
- Why?
- Well, I know Mom is concerned

04:32.522 --> 04:33.478
that I don't have any friends,

04:33.690 --> 04:36.478
so I'm determined
to remedy the situation.

04:37.152 --> 04:37.858
Oh.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.234
George.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.274
Well, good for you.

04:41.907 --> 04:42.897
Do you feel complimented

04:43.116 --> 04:44.652
<i>when I say your name, George?</i>

04:44.868 --> 04:47.406
The book says you should.
George.

04:47.746 --> 04:48.907
I suppose.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.533
Kind of overdoing it a little.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.532
- Sheldon.
<i>- Well, thank you</i>

04:52.751 --> 04:53.992
for your criticism.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.542
It also says I should praise

04:55.754 --> 04:57.871
any improvements
that you've made.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.418
Okay.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.044
I'll get back to you.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.089
George.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.175
<i>On the heels</i>

05:11.394 --> 05:13.101
<i>of that successful beta test,</i>

05:13.313 --> 05:15.521

the Carnegie principles</i>

05:15.732 --> 05:17.223
<i>on someone my own age.</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:22.441
- Hello, Billy Sparks.
- Hey, Sheldon.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.609
I am genuinely interested
in you

05:24.825 --> 05:27.784
and would like to encourage you
to talk about yourself.

05:28.036 --> 05:28.867
Billy Sparks.

05:29.079 --> 05:29.819
Thank you.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.328
You have the floor.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.205
Thank you.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.834
<i>Looking back,
I would've had better luck</i>

05:45.053 --> 05:46.715
<i>making friends
with the chickens.</i>

05:47.973 --> 05:49.054
Go Wolves.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.009
What?

05:50.517 --> 05:51.928
You're a cheerleader,
and by saying

05:52.143 --> 05:54.055
"Go Wolves,"
I'm initiating a conversation

05:54.271 --> 05:55.933
about something
that interests you.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.561
Oh, are you
one of those special ed kids?

05:59.818 --> 06:01.559
My mom says I'm special.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.269
Would you like to be friends?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.191
I don't think so.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.939
Are you sure?
What if I told you

06:07.158 --> 06:09.445
I admired
your boldly-applied makeup?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.747
<i>Greetings from stall number one.</i>

06:18.962 --> 06:21.705
<i>As much as I detest
that odd-smelling cigarette,</i>

06:21.923 --> 06:22.879
<i>I do applaud</i>

06:23.091 --> 06:24.673
<i>your rule-breaking
bravado.</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.552
<i>My name is Sheldon.
What's yours?</i>

06:30.140 --> 06:31.347
Hello, gentlemen.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.677
Did you watch any sports
programs over the weekend?

06:38.148 --> 06:40.765
Or perhaps did some kissing
with girls?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.521
Can you hear me?

06:51.036 --> 06:51.947
98.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.828
99, 100.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.617
- You missed 11 numbers.
<i>- I don't need</i>

06:56.833 --> 06:59.667
to be good at math.
I have beautiful hair.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.998
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.543
Didn't you already
read that book?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.294
I'm reading it again.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.374
How come?

07:07.844 --> 07:08.925
I clearly missed something.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.346
I couldn't find one person
who wanted to be my friend.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.264
Did you look at
the card inside?

07:15.477 --> 07:16.092
Why?

07:16.311 --> 07:18.553
That's just other people
who checked out the book.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.814
It's a list of losers like you
who can't find a friend.

07:22.233 --> 07:22.973
So?

07:23.401 --> 07:25.814
So they're desperate,
and you have their names.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.984
That's brilliant.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.822
Mm.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.443
Now, how is it
that you can't count?

07:41.878 --> 07:44.165
So your father tells me
you've been reading a new book?

07:44.381 --> 07:46.543
I am. It's about
how to make friends.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.257
Is that something
you're interested in?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.426
Not really, but Missy told me

07:51.638 --> 07:53.755
it makes you sad
that I don't have any.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.301
Oh.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.138
I got to sew
that girl's mouth shut.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.135
So how's it going?

08:00.355 --> 08:03.348
Well, the principles in the book
didn't work for me at all.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.395
Although Dad does like
being called George

08:05.610 --> 08:08.318
over and over again,
so you might give that a try.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.238
Baby, you don't have
to go to any trouble for me.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.860
But I like
doing things for you.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.237
You're a nice lady.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.036
- But if the book's not working...
- It isn't.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.746
But I realized
if I find the other people

08:20.000 --> 08:22.708
who checked out the book, they'd
be looking for friends, too.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.994
That's really smart.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.463
- Missy thought of it.
- You're kidding.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.874
I'm as surprised
as you are.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.169
Excuse me, Ms. Ingram?

08:35.472 --> 08:37.089
Sheldon, it's recess.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.015
Go outside, see
what it's like.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.186
Are you
by any chance Evelyn Ingram?

08:42.813 --> 08:43.725
Yes.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.058
The same Evelyn Ingram
who checked out this book?

08:47.277 --> 08:48.984
- And why is that your business?
- I just

08:49.195 --> 08:51.528
assumed you were looking
to make a friend.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.947
Oh.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.615
Well, that was
a long time ago.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.694
I had just gotten out of a
very difficult relationship.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.365
- With a friend?
<i>- Friend.</i>

08:59.581 --> 09:02.244
Ha! I gave that man
three years of my life

09:02.459 --> 09:03.540
and my innocence.

09:03.752 --> 09:04.959
I don't know what that means.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.538
It means men are lying dogs
only interested in one thing.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.706
Well, that's not
the dictionary definition.

09:10.925 --> 09:11.540
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

09:11.760 --> 09:13.342
Always starts the same.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.255
A quick glance across the room,
a casual hand on the shoulder,

09:17.474 --> 09:19.261
lunch at Stuckey's.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.592
<i>Oh, yeah, it's
all romance</i>

09:20.810 --> 09:21.971
and flowers in the beginning...

09:22.187 --> 09:24.850
<i>The list proved to be a double-edged sword.</i>

09:25.065 --> 09:28.900
<i>It turns out
self-help books written in 1936</i>

09:29.110 --> 09:30.772
<i>were only of interest
to adults.</i>

09:30.987 --> 09:32.273
You're like,
"I'm here because I care.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.355
And by the way, your phone
could make calls, too."

09:34.574 --> 09:35.815
Then tries to turn
this whole thing around

09:36.034 --> 09:37.195
like it's all
about you being needy,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.117
and you're like,
"Yes, I have needs!

09:39.329 --> 09:40.615
That's what makes me human!"

09:40.997 --> 09:43.330
<i>Emotionally</i> troubled <i>adults.</i>

09:43.541 --> 09:44.998
Child, go outside.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.413
Yes, that's my signature.
Why do you ask?

09:50.632 --> 09:52.965
I'm seeking people
who want to make friends.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.834
I wasn't interested in friends.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.295
I took out that book to help
me become school principal.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.224
- Did it work?
- Are we sitting in the principal's office?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.141
- No.
- And you know why?

10:03.603 --> 10:06.892
Because Victoria
MacElroy is not a man!

10:07.732 --> 10:10.440
So to be clear, you're <i>not</i>
interested in making friends?

10:10.652 --> 10:14.271
What I'm interested in
is in living long enough

10:14.489 --> 10:18.073
to see women no longer treated
like second-class citizens.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.820
Well if your goal
is a long life,

10:20.036 --> 10:23.074
that chili cheeseburger is
a step in the wrong direction.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.081
Food is all I have.

10:26.918 --> 10:27.954
<i>Like I said,</i>

10:28.169 --> 10:30.877
<i>emotionally troubled adults.</i>

10:31.089 --> 10:32.296
You gonna watch me eat?

10:32.507 --> 10:33.213
Get out of here.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.002
<i>Everybody told me,</i>

10:38.221 --> 10:40.053
"Hubert, don't date
someone from work."

10:40.390 --> 10:42.177
But did I listen? No.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.928
Let me tell you something.
She likes to say

10:44.144 --> 10:45.134
I stole <i>her</i> innocence?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.560
Well, what about <i>my</i> innocence?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.103
I was never the same
after we broke up.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.054
<i>Two years later,</i>

10:49.274 --> 10:51.641
<i>Mr. Givens became
the high school principal,</i>

10:51.860 --> 10:54.819
<i>which might be why Ms. MacElroy
became morbidly obese.</i>

10:55.029 --> 10:57.396
I had the brains, I had the
charm, and I don't like to brag,

10:57.615 --> 10:59.356
but I was pretty easy
on the eyes back then.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.613
That woman got herself
one heck of a package.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.694
<i>But some people don't
want to be satisfied.</i>

11:05.957 --> 11:07.323
Is that any good?

11:08.126 --> 11:08.957
I'm afraid not.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.910
I failed to make
a single friend.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.963
That sucks. I have a tough time
making friends, too.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.461
The worst part is, it
was important to my mom.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.461
My parents pressure me about
making friends all the time.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.636
So you understand
what I'm going through.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.344
Oh, I read that book.
It's excellent.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.968
Are you into rocketry?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.304
I started with
water propulsion,

11:29.522 --> 11:30.683
worked my way up
to solid fuel,

11:30.899 --> 11:33.733
then went back to water after
I set our garage on fire.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.561
- Nice.
- I also tried to get some uranium

11:36.779 --> 11:40.022
and build an atomic engine,
but that stuff's hard to find.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.775
Probably for the best.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.077
Well, good luck on your
quest to find a friend.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.241
You, too.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.170
If you haven't found one
yet, I have good news.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.085
Mom, what do you know
about the drug Prozac?

12:01.638 --> 12:02.469
Not much.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.797
Supposed to make
people happier. Why?

12:05.767 --> 12:06.427
I was just thinking

12:06.643 --> 12:08.805
some of my teachers
might benefit from it.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.053
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

12:11.272 --> 12:13.389
you'll be happy to know
I made a friend today.

12:14.192 --> 12:14.852
Oh.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.727
Well, that's nice.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.858
But, as I said,
this isn't for me.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.189
It's for you.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.569
He made a friend!

12:23.826 --> 12:24.691
<i>He did it!</i>

12:24.911 --> 12:27.654
Our little boy has got a friend.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.454
- Who is it?
- Who cares?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.749
It's a human being.
It's a warm body.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.659
<i>Mom?</i>

12:33.878 --> 12:34.459
Yes, honey?

12:34.671 --> 12:36.253
<i>- Can I come in?</i>
- Of course.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.875
Be cool.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.674
- What's up, sweetie?
- I was wondering

12:40.885 --> 12:43.172
when I could continue
my rocketry hobby.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.379
Uh, Sheldon,
we've been through this.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.009
You can build them.
You just can't launch them.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.091
But launching them
is the fun part.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.100
Tell that to the family
of squirrels

12:50.311 --> 12:52.678
- who died in the fire.
- Okay.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.355
It was just something I was
hoping to do with my new friend.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.561
Hang on.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.017
Uh, yes.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.234
<i>It's fine.</i>

12:59.445 --> 13:00.231
Ban is lifted.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.153
- Mary...
- It's for his friend.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.526
He's got a friend.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.699
Besides,
those could have been rats.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.651
Their bodies
were so badly burned.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.696
I thought we were being cool,
but okay.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.452
Hey, here's an idea.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.909
Why don't you invite your
new buddy over for dinner?

13:15.169 --> 13:16.455
- Why?
- Well, honey,

13:16.671 --> 13:19.755
um, that is what friends do.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.298
My mother asked
me to ask you

13:21.509 --> 13:23.671
if you'd like to
join us for dinner.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.966
- Why?
- I was hoping you'd know.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.099
<i>He's here!</i>

13:34.439 --> 13:36.726
<i>Everybody, stay calm!
Just a normal day,</i>

13:36.941 --> 13:39.274
<i>- just a normal dinner.
- Can I eat in front of the TV?</i>

13:39.527 --> 13:41.439
<i>No, you can eat
in front of Sheldon's friend.</i>

13:41.654 --> 13:43.566
<i>- Aw, fudge.
- I know what "fudge" means,</i>

13:43.781 --> 13:45.773
<i>and you are right
on the edge, young lady.</i>

13:46.659 --> 13:47.820
Welcome.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.036
<i>So, uh...</i>

13:59.297 --> 14:01.163
Tam. What kind of name is that?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.006
Vietnamese. Sir.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.083
Sure. You know, I spent
a little time over there.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.418
Army.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.215
Your mom's name isn't
Kim-Lee, is it?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.803
No. Sir.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.100
Good.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.895
I mean, you know,
it's a small country.

14:18.149 --> 14:18.935
So...

14:19.150 --> 14:20.391
Mary, how's that food coming?

14:20.610 --> 14:21.350
<i>Almost.</i>

14:21.736 --> 14:23.568
So, Vietnam, like in <i>Rambo.</i>

14:23.946 --> 14:25.687
- Yes.
- That's a cool movie.

14:26.032 --> 14:26.692
Yes.

14:27.075 --> 14:27.861
Are you in it?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.904
- No.
- Hmm.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.949
Why would you think
you knew his mom?

14:33.456 --> 14:34.742
<i>All right, Tam.</i>

14:34.957 --> 14:37.700
I decided I was gonna make
you a real Texas dinner.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.376
Barbecued chicken and brisket.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.373
Thank you.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.999
Well, I figured
you were probably tired

14:42.215 --> 14:44.002
of stuff wiggling around
on your plate.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.125
<i>Okay, let's say grace.</i>

14:46.344 --> 14:47.551
Now, Tam, when I say "Jesus,"

14:47.762 --> 14:49.845
feel free to say the word
"Buddha" in your head.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.046
I'm actually Catholic.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.924
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.760
<i>Thank you, God,
for this food,</i>

14:55.978 --> 14:57.139
<i>and bless the hands
that prepared it.</i>

14:57.355 --> 15:00.348
And thank you so much
for Sheldon's new friend.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.977
Amen.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.235
So, Tam, tell us
about your family.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.857
What brings y'all to Texas?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.939
Well, after the American War...

15:09.158 --> 15:10.274
You mean the Vietnam War.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.825
We call it the American War.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.110
- Hmm.
- Anyway,

15:13.329 --> 15:14.945
after the war, my
father was sent

15:15.164 --> 15:16.325
to a reeducation camp

15:16.541 --> 15:17.622
because he fought
on the wrong side.

15:17.834 --> 15:18.699
You mean our side.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.292
I was trying to be nice.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.211
<i>So, for many years,</i>

15:23.423 --> 15:24.880
<i>my mother and my
sisters and I</i>

15:25.091 --> 15:25.956
<i>were very poor</i>

15:26.426 --> 15:28.418
and very often
didn't have much to eat.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.502
Then, when he was released...

15:30.721 --> 15:32.553
What'd they teach him
at the reeducation camp?

15:32.765 --> 15:33.846
How to be a communist.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.515
Cool, like in <i>Rambo.</i>

15:37.395 --> 15:38.135
<i>When he was released,</i>

15:38.354 --> 15:40.220
we escaped on a small boat

15:40.690 --> 15:43.899
and spent many weeks at sea
dodging Cambodian pirates

15:44.110 --> 15:45.442
until we reached Thailand.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.400
Oh, that's supposed to be
a beautiful country.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.738
- Lovely beaches.
<i>- I wouldn't know.</i>

15:50.992 --> 15:53.154
We were forced to live
in a refugee camp,

15:53.453 --> 15:56.116
where the only thing we had
to eat were pigeons and rats.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.580
Ha! That's a job for hot sauce.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.291
Finally,

16:01.544 --> 16:03.206
we were allowed
to come to United States

16:03.421 --> 16:05.128
and start over in Galveston.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.922
My father saved money
and bought his own shrimp boat.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.842
There's a happy ending. Huh?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.840
See, kids?
When the going gets tough,

16:13.055 --> 16:15.047
- America provides.
<i>- It did.</i>

16:15.266 --> 16:18.100
Until the Ku Klux Klan
burned our boat

16:18.311 --> 16:19.643
and chased us away.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.103
You gonna put a good spin
on that one?

16:22.607 --> 16:23.814
<i>So we came to Medford</i>

16:24.025 --> 16:25.857
and opened up
a convenience store.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.560
My parents work 16 hours a day,

16:28.779 --> 16:30.520
seven days a week

16:30.740 --> 16:32.447
for very little money.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.909
Well, that was depressing.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.797
I don't understand
why it didn't launch.

16:49.008 --> 16:49.998
Me, neither.

16:50.218 --> 16:53.256
Evil Nazi scientists
did it 50 years ago.

16:53.888 --> 16:54.924
How hard could it be?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.142
Can I help you?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.562
Sorry to bother you, ma'am. FBI.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.638
We're looking
for a Sheldon Lee Cooper.

17:07.068 --> 17:07.808
George!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.608
<i>I'm on the can.</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:11.272
Now!

17:12.949 --> 17:14.065
- What?
- These gentlemen

17:14.282 --> 17:16.900
are with the FBI.
They want to talk to Sheldon.

17:17.912 --> 17:18.652
What?

17:18.996 --> 17:19.906
<i>We... Uh...</i>

17:20.122 --> 17:22.114
Y-You fellas
must have made a mistake.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.243
Sheldon's nine.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.540
Well, someone living
at this address

17:24.752 --> 17:26.993
recently called a mining
operation in Canada

17:27.213 --> 17:28.374
and tried to buy uranium.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.380
Okay, maybe it's not a mistake.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.002
It's ridiculous.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.337
Let's just go talk to him.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.134
Huh?

17:34.345 --> 17:36.177
He's just a little,
itty-bitty thing.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.550
Really, he's harmless.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.597
<i>Sorry!</i>

17:44.438 --> 17:45.679
He's in the garage.
