<i>All trains departing lower levels.</i>

02:12.745 --> 02:15.682
<i>The Collective runs
by everybody doing their part.</i>

02:15.782 --> 02:18.752
<i>Report suspicious activity
to health and safety.</i>

02:18.852 --> 02:21.088
<i>Health and safety is here to help.</i>

02:21.188 --> 02:23.947
<i>Just look for the black and white vests.</i>

02:27.593 --> 02:30.586
- After you.
- Thank you.

02:38.270 --> 02:41.596
<i>This train serves
the north-east work sectors.</i>

02:47.380 --> 02:49.850
<i>This is a message from the Collective.</i>

02:49.950 --> 02:54.188
<i>Are you overly tired?
Or experiencing increased sensitivity?</i>

02:54.288 --> 02:56.824
<i>Maybe you have difficulty concentrating.</i>

02:56.924 --> 03:01.050
<i>You may have S.O.S. Switched On Syndrome.</i>

03:05.032 --> 03:07.551
<i>...a further 43 degrees along this orbit</i>

03:11.104 --> 03:13.529
<i>into TK-14's atmosphere...</i>

03:42.501 --> 03:47.274
<i>...bombs dropped for the span
of 28 days and obliterated 99.6%</i>

03:47.374 --> 03:50.411
<i>of usable arid land

03:50.511 --> 03:53.280
<i>And event that changed the course
of human kind forever,</i>

03:53.380 --> 03:55.988
<i>and now known as the great war.</i>

03:56.088 --> 03:59.153
<i>...of the two tracts of land
that survived the great war.</i>

03:59.253 --> 04:02.856
<i>The Peninsula still stands 44 degrees
west of the Collective.</i>

04:02.956 --> 04:08.618
<i>And is a wild primitive area,
containing empty, dilapidated buildings...</i>

04:10.030 --> 04:13.934
<i>...and little is known of the primitive
nature of the Peninsula's inhabitants.</i>

04:14.034 --> 04:17.438
<i>The defects living there are ruled
by emotion and base desires.</i>

04:17.538 --> 04:19.540
<i>An ancient vestige of our past.</i>

04:19.640 --> 04:24.578
<i>This image shows Equis 12 leaving Earth's
orbit on last week's interstellar mission.</i>

04:24.678 --> 04:27.236
<i>Who wrote the text for this feature?</i>

04:27.713 --> 04:30.049
Me, I did.

04:30.149 --> 04:33.676
- Does this accurate, Nia?
- Yes.

04:34.020 --> 04:38.225
Except the rocket's fission thrusters
are cylindrical, these appear triangular.

04:38.325 --> 04:41.050
Thank you. I'll change that.

05:02.648 --> 05:05.657
Iris is back from conception duty.

05:08.588 --> 05:10.990
She got back yesterday.

05:11.090 --> 05:12.992
She had a defect.

05:13.092 --> 05:15.027
How do you know?

05:15.127 --> 05:18.165
- She told me.
- Did she have the bug?

05:18.265 --> 05:20.806
No. She says she's clean.

05:22.468 --> 05:24.838
Where is everyone watching
the landing tomorrow night?

05:24.938 --> 05:29.209
I'm watching it in Bishop Park. I'm going
to leave work early to get a good seat.

05:29.309 --> 05:33.066
If I arrive early enough I can get
a seat close to the screen.

05:55.234 --> 05:56.975
David!

05:57.136 --> 05:58.945
David!

06:00.706 --> 06:02.548
David!

06:02.875 --> 06:04.683
David!

06:05.778 --> 06:10.189
You're in safe hands now folks.
Please continue on your way.

07:11.360 --> 07:17.008
<i>Total number of puzzles solved, 2224.</i>

07:28.961 --> 07:33.500
<i>The following is an update on last night's
disturbance in living block 5-J.</i>

07:33.600 --> 07:38.071
<i>Health and safety officials subdued two
individuals engaged in coupling activities.</i>

07:38.171 --> 07:42.524
<i>And both have been transported to the
defective, emotional, neuropathy facility,</i>

07:42.624 --> 07:46.413
<i>the den, for containment
and emotional suppression treatment.</i>

07:46.513 --> 07:49.483
<i>The incident is an outbreak
of defective behavior.</i>

07:49.583 --> 07:53.487
<i>Remember, couplers are a danger
to themselves and to all of us.</i>

07:53.587 --> 07:57.507
<i>Physical contact, touching,
or displays of emotions</i>

07:57.607 --> 08:00.594
<i>are signs of an individual
infected with S.O.S.</i>

08:00.694 --> 08:04.748
<i>If you see the signs, report the couplers
to health and safety immediately.</i>

08:04.848 --> 08:08.891
<i>Let's do our part to help contain
this dangerous epidemic.</i>

08:14.462 --> 08:18.211
<i>...with no infrastructure
the Collective erected a patrolled border</i>

08:18.311 --> 08:21.587
<i>to contain any resurgence of chaos...</i>

08:26.585 --> 08:29.595
- Did anybody see that?
- See what?

08:44.703 --> 08:47.341
- That's unfortunate.
- He's already dead.

08:47.441 --> 08:49.733
- Anyone recognize him?
- Not sure.

08:49.833 --> 08:53.247
- Don't think so.
- That's our first jumper in a while.

08:53.347 --> 08:55.682
His head was no match for that concrete.

08:55.782 --> 08:59.052
I just remembered there was a suicide
in my building last night,

08:59.152 --> 09:00.687
a woman slit her throat.

09:00.787 --> 09:04.029
I hope they find someone
to cover his work.

09:28.448 --> 09:33.654
<i>Even before the demise, humankind knew
the importance of space exploration.</i>

09:33.754 --> 09:37.658
<i>As the Collective,
we prioritize it and perfect it.</i>

09:37.758 --> 09:41.469
<i>Now, 798 million miles away,</i>

09:41.569 --> 09:44.592
<i>as we brace the surface of TK-14,</i>

09:44.692 --> 09:48.335
<i>we move one step further in our
understanding of ultimate reality.</i>

09:48.435 --> 09:50.637
<i>Okay, everybody, this is it.</i>

09:50.737 --> 09:54.880
<i>3... 2... 1... Mark.</i>

11:29.251 --> 11:33.824
Last but not least. Speculative non-fiction,
the title is inside the Peninsula.

11:33.924 --> 11:37.532
Silas, will you talk us
through the lead illustration?

11:38.010 --> 11:39.885
Silas?

11:41.814 --> 11:44.049
Sorry, Leonard.

11:44.149 --> 11:47.320
I went with the scene on the Peninsula where
the defects huddle together for warmth.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.890
In my research I found that they form
social bonds with each other

11:49.990 --> 11:52.125
to help alleviate
something called anxiety.

11:52.225 --> 11:55.701
- Very good.
- Thank you.

13:12.204 --> 13:16.692
<i>While scientists are making great strides in
understanding this debilitating condition.</i>

13:16.792 --> 13:20.213
<i>A reliable cure for S.O.S.
has yet to be found.</i>

13:20.313 --> 13:24.551
<i>And most S.O.S. sufferers will experience
complete emotional disability.</i>

13:24.651 --> 13:26.853
<i>In as little as four to six months.</i>

13:26.953 --> 13:29.355
<i>Prior to eventual containment at the den,</i>

13:29.455 --> 13:33.092
<i>Kappa Rho inhibitors offer a reliable
means of dampening symptoms,</i>

13:33.192 --> 13:35.462
<i>and slowing the stages of the disease.</i>

13:35.562 --> 13:39.104
- <i>Thus allowing sufferers to maintain...</i>
- What stage?

13:40.065 --> 13:43.068
- Excuse me?
- What stage are you?

13:43.969 --> 13:47.207
Oh, I'm just here for a check up.
Strictly precautionary.

13:49.608 --> 13:51.683
I'm Jonas.

13:51.844 --> 13:53.711
Silas.

13:56.215 --> 13:58.256
What stage are you?

13:58.517 --> 14:00.358
Two.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.495
You look healthy.

14:04.823 --> 14:07.999
Well, I have my good days and my bad days.

14:10.662 --> 14:13.471
- Silas?
- Good luck.

14:13.799 --> 14:15.193
Thank you.

14:17.002 --> 14:19.271
The ground was rushing towards me.

14:19.371 --> 14:21.612
I couldn't breathe.

14:22.708 --> 14:25.250
I felt like my stomach was...

14:26.011 --> 14:28.915
it was in my mouth.
It was extremely unpleasant.

14:29.015 --> 14:31.589
You had a nightmare, Silas.

14:33.185 --> 14:36.455
I never want to experience
anything like it again.

14:36.555 --> 14:38.724
How long have you had these symptoms?

14:38.824 --> 14:41.728
Maybe three days. No longer than that.

14:41.828 --> 14:44.218
I'm going to take some blood now.

14:45.631 --> 14:48.322
Can you give me your hand please, Silas?

14:57.009 --> 14:59.378
Your test is positive, Silas.

14:59.478 --> 15:01.869
You're only stage one.

15:03.582 --> 15:07.442
A woman in my office recently
gave birth to a defect, I...

15:08.053 --> 15:10.423
I couldn't have caught it from her.
Not if she's clean, right?

15:10.523 --> 15:14.527
Even if this woman did have S.O.S.,
it isn't contagious.

15:14.627 --> 15:17.230
I'd like to start you on a full course
of inhibitors immediately.

15:17.330 --> 15:20.233
There's no reason why you shouldn't
be able to live a normal life.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.401
At least for a while.

15:22.501 --> 15:25.605
- And the den.
- You mustn't think about that for now.

15:25.705 --> 15:30.164
The den is a long way off for you.
A cure is right around the corner.

16:00.272 --> 16:02.696
Where were you, Silas?

16:03.108 --> 16:05.980
I went to the cafeteria to drink some tea.

16:06.612 --> 16:09.147
Is that where you got the bruise?

16:09.247 --> 16:14.175
No. Last night in Tai Chi class, the man
next to me accidentally struck me.

16:14.753 --> 16:17.023
Silas, you weren't
in Tai Chi class last night.

16:17.123 --> 16:19.324
Yes, he was.

16:19.424 --> 16:21.682
I saw him.

16:42.097 --> 16:44.188
What's that?

16:47.185 --> 16:48.904
It's a bumblebee.

16:49.254 --> 16:52.233
Careful. Don't they sting?

17:01.833 --> 17:04.469
According to the laws of aerodynamics
they shouldn't even fly.

17:07.372 --> 17:11.432
But they don't know it.
So they fly anyway.

17:58.624 --> 18:03.079
<i>Be part of the solution by taking your
inhibitors. Your health is the health...</i>

18:03.179 --> 18:05.236
Picking up.

18:10.335 --> 18:15.141
<i>If you're watching this film,
your doctor has diagnosed you with S.O.S.</i>

18:15.241 --> 18:17.143
<i>Switched On Syndrome.</i>

18:17.243 --> 18:21.548
<i>As members of the Collective,
we hear a lot about Switched On Syndrome.</i>

18:21.648 --> 18:26.152
<i>Here is important information about how
this debilitating disease will affect you.</i>

18:26.252 --> 18:29.555
<i>And how you can manage it responsibly
before eventual containment</i>

18:29.655 --> 18:34.249
<i>at the defective emotional
neuropathy facility, the den.</i>

18:35.093 --> 18:38.214
<i>Switched On Syndrome
is a malfunction of the gene silencing</i>

18:38.314 --> 18:41.868
<i>that controls human emotions
and eliminates human flaws.</i>

18:41.968 --> 18:46.272
<i>But in Switched On Syndrome, problem
genes lose their silencing and re-awaken.</i>

18:46.372 --> 18:51.611
<i>Leading to unpredictable sensory
experiences and behavioral defects.</i>

18:51.711 --> 18:53.146
<i>Until a cure is available.</i>

18:53.246 --> 18:57.050
<i>Inhibitors are the only effective means
of slowing the disease's staging,</i>

18:57.150 --> 19:00.174
<i>while dampening the onset of emotion.</i>

19:00.285 --> 19:02.288
<i>And while the causes are unknown,</i>

19:02.388 --> 19:05.746
<i>we do understand
the disease's progression.</i>

19:06.191 --> 19:08.852
<i>During stage one, intermittent feeling,</i>

19:08.952 --> 19:12.398
<i>you will experience
difficulty concentrating,</i>

19:12.498 --> 19:16.336
<i>depression, pain, overwhelmed feelings,</i>

19:16.536 --> 19:20.661
<i>impulsivity and sensitivity to light.</i>

19:21.273 --> 19:23.876
<i>As the disease progresses
into further stages,</i>

19:24.026 --> 19:27.180
<i>consistent low level emotion
and emotional volatility,</i>

19:27.280 --> 19:29.081
<i>these symptoms will worsen.</i>

19:29.181 --> 19:32.285
<i>In stage four, acute behavioral chaos,</i>

19:32.385 --> 19:35.455
<i>you will no longer function as
a productive member of the Collective.</i>

19:35.555 --> 19:38.191
<i>And your doctor will prescribe
containment at the den.</i>

19:38.291 --> 19:40.693
<i>Where you will be provided
with electro restraint,</i>

19:40.793 --> 19:44.963
<i>emotional suppression,
and a pain-free death scenario.</i>

19:45.063 --> 19:47.267
<i>If you have questions
about your condition,</i>

19:47.367 --> 19:51.170
<i>notify your doctor or health and safety
official for immediate attention.</i>

19:51.270 --> 19:54.763
<i>And remember,
a cure is right around the corner.</i>

20:30.208 --> 20:32.044
Hello, Silas.

20:32.144 --> 20:34.268
Hello, Nia.

22:02.492 --> 22:05.047
- Individuals no longer...
- Nia...

22:06.838 --> 22:09.409
I read your article
on the Harlow Nine probe.

22:09.509 --> 22:12.478
I was wondering if you
could look over my impressions.

22:12.578 --> 22:15.369
But you're speculative non-fiction.

22:15.747 --> 22:18.105
I switched with Leonard.

22:19.484 --> 22:21.342
Why?

22:22.954 --> 22:25.142
I felt like a change.

22:27.859 --> 22:30.479
There's a staff meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

22:30.579 --> 22:33.031
Why don't I review your work then?

22:33.131 --> 22:37.440
I'd really appreciate your input at this
early stage, if it's not too much trouble.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.636
This isn't what I described.

23:11.736 --> 23:15.262
- Isn't it?
- Harlow Nine is a lander not an orbiter.

23:16.475 --> 23:19.767
- And where's its robotic arm?
- Are those for a feature?

23:20.645 --> 23:21.447
Yes.

23:21.547 --> 23:23.316
I thought you were
speculative non-fiction.

23:23.416 --> 23:25.839
I switched with Leonard.

23:26.718 --> 23:29.672
One more thing. The Eleos landing
was made on a flat surface.

23:29.772 --> 23:31.841
The way you've drawn it,
it looks almost mountainous.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.765
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Silas?

23:36.861 --> 23:39.286
Thank you for your feedback.

23:42.067 --> 23:44.158
You're welcome.

24:41.226 --> 24:43.862
<i>It's this vastness...</i>

24:44.262 --> 24:47.187
<i>inaccessibility, symmetry...</i>

24:47.465 --> 24:50.769
<i>and the permanence of the night sky
that made it a natural topic</i>

24:50.869 --> 24:54.873
<i>for philosophers pursuing
the understanding of ultimate reality.</i>

24:54.973 --> 24:57.464
<i>It's this vastness...</i>

24:57.843 --> 25:00.768
<i>inaccessibility, symmetry...</i>

25:01.481 --> 25:03.649
<i>and permanence of the night sky</i>

25:03.749 --> 25:07.074
<i>that made it a natural topic
for philosophers...</i>

25:13.325 --> 25:17.197
At Atmos our past is not a relic
we should leave behind.

25:17.297 --> 25:20.399
But a living creation,
something to be handled.

25:20.499 --> 25:24.238
The work we do at Atmos
is that which links our present.

25:26.438 --> 25:28.862
I'm so sorry.

25:32.243 --> 25:34.668
You dropped these.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.272
Thank you.

25:47.192 --> 25:52.170
It's about time you all knew.
Last week I... tested positive for S.O.S.

25:54.466 --> 25:57.958
I'm stage one. I'm taking inhibitors.

25:58.536 --> 26:00.983
There is no evidence that the bug
is contagious. However...

26:01.083 --> 26:04.076
if it makes you feel more comfortable,
I'll wear a face mask from now on.

26:04.176 --> 26:08.469
- Silas, I'm very sorry.
- How long do you have?

26:10.048 --> 26:11.217
It's difficult to say.

26:11.317 --> 26:14.353
Is this why you stopped doing
speculative non-fiction?

26:14.453 --> 26:16.777
I don't know, Rachel.

26:18.323 --> 26:19.458
Possibly.

26:19.558 --> 26:23.362
A face mask is a little extreme. Although I
don't think he should sit with us anymore.

26:23.462 --> 26:26.220
And you should have your own mug.

26:28.867 --> 26:30.924
Do you all agree?

26:33.005 --> 26:35.608
We cured cancer. We cured the common cold.

26:35.708 --> 26:40.734
We can cure S.O.S.
You're going to live, pal.

26:42.114 --> 26:44.371
Thank you all.

27:29.060 --> 27:31.352
This has to stop.

27:34.232 --> 27:37.102
If it continues I'll be forced
to report you.

27:37.202 --> 27:39.292
Do you understand?

27:44.642 --> 27:47.634
You have the bug. Don't you?

27:48.246 --> 27:50.247
I'm clean.

27:54.152 --> 27:57.411
The day that man
jumped off the building...

27:57.656 --> 28:00.914
you saw his body out the window, you...

28:03.328 --> 28:05.019
you looked...

28:05.964 --> 28:07.821
affected.

28:08.433 --> 28:11.038
There have been other times, too.
I've been watching you.

28:11.138 --> 28:14.123
The way you look at the world,
the way you experience things.

28:14.223 --> 28:16.280
I'm clean.

28:18.410 --> 28:20.467
It's different.

28:21.980 --> 28:24.738
What you are going through
must be very difficult.

28:25.730 --> 28:28.187
If you were clean, this conversation
wouldn't even be taking place.

28:28.287 --> 28:30.555
You'd have reported me already.

28:30.655 --> 28:32.779
Am I right?

28:35.126 --> 28:37.351
Goodnight, Silas.

28:46.170 --> 28:49.530
- Good morning, Silas.
- Good morning, Nia.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.924
And finally, the Harlow landing.

29:18.870 --> 29:21.640
Nia, do you have any more notes for me?

29:21.740 --> 29:24.859
No. Your changes work well. Thank you.

29:24.959 --> 29:27.550
Onto the next article then. Zoe?

29:27.712 --> 29:30.957
These are my impressions of the hot
flow anomaly on the planet BL4.

29:31.057 --> 29:33.340
The visible bioshock...

30:07.151 --> 30:10.981
- Goodnight, Nia.
- Goodnight, Rachel.

33:34.942 --> 33:37.067
Your bruise went away.

33:37.962 --> 33:39.833
You noticed that?

33:43.134 --> 33:46.504
I've had the bug a year and three months.

33:46.604 --> 33:49.474
I didn't want to go to the doctor.
I just sort of knew.

33:49.574 --> 33:53.967
You know there is really nothing
any... anyone could do to help.

33:56.547 --> 34:00.172
And I'm scared of the meds and then...

34:04.889 --> 34:07.347
Doesn't seem fair at first.

34:07.825 --> 34:09.362
Right?

34:13.531 --> 34:15.833
You know I could live...
I could live with it.

34:15.934 --> 34:18.137
But every day was different
and that was the hardest part.

34:18.237 --> 34:21.962
Every single time I thought I knew
something or learned anything, I...

34:27.210 --> 34:28.405
didn't.

34:30.514 --> 34:33.752
And I felt this guilt every time
I wanted to go back to normal.

34:33.851 --> 34:36.743
Like I shouldn't want that.

34:37.922 --> 34:42.681
Every day I am practicing
unbearable discipline and self-control.

34:44.829 --> 34:48.621
You realize what would happen
if anyone saw us in here right now?

34:52.036 --> 34:55.094
We'd go straight to the den.
It's a death sentence.

34:56.774 --> 35:00.111
One of my neighbors missed
two doctor's appointments.

35:00.211 --> 35:02.618
I haven't seen him in six weeks.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.691
We can't do this again.

35:10.588 --> 35:14.163
It can't happen, you know that.

35:23.234 --> 35:25.274
We just...

35:26.637 --> 35:29.478
We just have to hold out for the cure.

35:37.715 --> 35:40.623
Will you stay in here with me
a little longer?

36:20.057 --> 36:22.860
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.234
I need to go.

36:39.743 --> 36:42.915
Nia, are you staying late again tonight?

36:43.015 --> 36:47.303
- I'm not sure.
- I wish I had your kind of work ethic.

36:48.586 --> 36:50.222
I received a message from Zoe.

36:50.322 --> 36:53.859
On her way to work this morning
she received a conception duty summons.

36:53.959 --> 36:56.561
Could one of the illustrators
present for her in the staff meeting?

36:56.661 --> 36:59.835
I'll do it. I'll be glad to.

37:10.674 --> 37:13.449
- Good night, Nia.
- Good night, Kate.

37:17.248 --> 37:21.123
They may simply be labeled as dualist.

37:22.753 --> 37:26.723
Two subject concepts and materialist
one subject concepts.

37:43.275 --> 37:46.049
The way you've been looking at me...

37:46.978 --> 37:49.180
I can't help it.

37:50.314 --> 37:52.555
I can feel it.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.561
What does it feel like?

38:02.092 --> 38:04.467
It feels just wrong.

38:08.532 --> 38:11.702
No, no. No.

38:11.802 --> 38:15.277
It's not wrong.
It's completely right. This feels...

38:15.840 --> 38:18.281
completely right.

38:48.272 --> 38:50.274
I'm scared.

38:50.374 --> 38:52.643
I'm so scared.

38:52.743 --> 38:54.751
Me too.

40:31.342 --> 40:33.549
Hello, Leonard.

40:33.944 --> 40:35.785
Silas.

40:36.747 --> 40:40.222
I didn't expect to see you here this late.

40:43.687 --> 40:46.957
Have you thought about killing yourself?

40:47.057 --> 40:50.366
No, that's not until stage three.

40:56.133 --> 40:58.908
Why is Nia's interface on?

41:00.738 --> 41:03.846
Have you been snooping again, Silas?

41:04.875 --> 41:06.144
Excuse me?

41:06.244 --> 41:10.115
A month ago, health and safety
saw you on Nia's interface after-hours.

41:10.215 --> 41:13.150
I was told to keep an eye on you.

41:13.250 --> 41:16.291
Is there something you want to tell me?

41:18.389 --> 41:20.058
As the manager here at Atmos,

41:20.158 --> 41:24.295
one of my duties is to maintain
the safety and welfare of the team.

41:24.395 --> 41:28.133
Therefore, if I believe that someone
on the team is in danger,

41:28.233 --> 41:32.369
or involved in an activity that is unsafe,

41:32.469 --> 41:35.272
I'd report him, or her,

41:35.372 --> 41:37.541
to health and safety.

41:37.641 --> 41:41.183
Unless, of course,
the activity were to stop.

41:42.546 --> 41:44.620
Does that make sense to you?

41:47.051 --> 41:48.553
Yes.

41:49.053 --> 41:50.888
Good.

41:51.538 --> 41:53.947
Shall we get out of here, Silas?

42:36.834 --> 42:39.842
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Nia.

43:23.113 --> 43:25.254
He knows.

43:28.285 --> 43:30.760
What are we going to do?

43:36.226 --> 43:39.068
We have to stay away from each other.

43:41.432 --> 43:45.236
I can't... stay away from you. I can't...

43:45.336 --> 43:47.404
not be around you.

43:47.504 --> 43:51.380
Not in that office. Not when
I see you everyday. It's impossible.

43:57.581 --> 44:00.118
I thought about it. The best thing
is for me to leave Atmos.

44:00.218 --> 44:02.691
Get a job somewhere else.

44:15.065 --> 44:17.067
It's like you said...

44:17.167 --> 44:20.709
we have to hold on for the cure.
That's all we should be thinking about.

44:32.883 --> 44:34.724
Nia...

45:29.907 --> 45:32.477
<i>Have you received
a conception duty summons?</i>

45:32.577 --> 45:35.479
<i>Let's work together
to populate the Collective.</i>

45:35.579 --> 45:38.016
<i>Insemination is quick and solitary,</i>

45:38.116 --> 45:42.153
<i>and during gestation you'll be supporting
and growing the Collective.</i>

45:42.253 --> 45:45.261
<i>If you received a summons please...</i>

45:50.761 --> 45:53.363
Are you sure this is what you want?

45:53.463 --> 45:54.965
I'm sure.

45:55.065 --> 45:57.655
Positions at Atmos are highly coveted.
Once we've placed you...

45:57.755 --> 45:59.038
I understand.

46:02.272 --> 46:04.375
Because of my diagnosis,
I think a work environment

46:04.475 --> 46:07.449
where I interact less with others
would be better.

46:07.778 --> 46:10.018
For everyone's benefit.

46:11.214 --> 46:13.989
That's a very responsible attitude.

46:23.231 --> 46:26.164
Oh, Nia... meet Dominic,
our new illustrator.

46:26.264 --> 46:30.468
Dominic, this is Nia, she works in text.
You'll be interpreting her words.

46:30.568 --> 46:34.771
- It's very nice to meet you, Nia.
- Welcome to Atmos.

46:34.871 --> 46:37.079
Follow me.

47:38.268 --> 47:43.640
I also design rockets. I could have been
an engineer, but I lacked patience.

47:43.740 --> 47:47.711
I think working at Atmos
is a vitally important job.

47:47.811 --> 47:51.720
Science is a process
and often leads to dead-ends.

47:52.049 --> 47:53.784
But here...

47:53.884 --> 47:57.922
we're delivering the answers,
we're educating people.

47:58.022 --> 48:01.759
Knowledge is sacred,
and Atmos is the new scripture.

48:01.859 --> 48:04.828
If you think about it,
we're kind of like preachers.

48:04.928 --> 48:06.531
Where did you study?

48:06.631 --> 48:09.801
I'm self-taught. I've always drawn
pictures ever since I was a child.

48:09.901 --> 48:14.509
One of my guardians, Barnabas,
nicknamed me Little Da Vinci.

48:15.439 --> 48:18.308
Did you hear? Zoe was inseminated.

48:18.408 --> 48:20.979
It means she's clean.
She didn't catch the bug from Silas.

48:21.079 --> 48:24.762
- That means we're probably clean, too.
- I'm definitely clean.

48:24.862 --> 48:27.422
I donated blood last week.

49:12.662 --> 49:14.536
Silas?

49:17.334 --> 49:19.174
Jonas?

49:25.942 --> 49:28.078
You okay?

49:28.178 --> 49:29.747
Okay.

49:30.597 --> 49:32.571
Do you want to take a walk?

49:39.656 --> 49:41.929
I miss her.

49:43.092 --> 49:47.570
I don't know, it felt so good
to be around her that...

49:48.598 --> 49:52.307
we were nearly tripping up
and I couldn't see...

49:53.003 --> 49:55.605
couldn't see anything bad
happening to her.

49:55.705 --> 49:58.141
You two were in love with each other.

49:58.241 --> 50:01.479
That's very clear.
You were right to end it though.

50:01.579 --> 50:04.115
I think dealing with this disease
on your own is hard enough,

50:04.215 --> 50:07.246
coupling would just make it unbearable.

50:13.390 --> 50:15.459
You know...

50:15.559 --> 50:17.766
about a year ago...

50:18.562 --> 50:21.803
I also made a connection with a woman.

50:24.167 --> 50:27.376
Though, it didn't end well.

50:33.076 --> 50:35.350
So sorry.

50:38.782 --> 50:42.457
Your friend, what stage is she?

50:43.086 --> 50:46.591
She's self-diagnosed.
She's fighting the bug without drugs.

50:46.691 --> 50:49.163
She's a "hider."

50:52.262 --> 50:56.833
Not many people can do that successfully.
I think hiders are...

50:56.933 --> 50:58.836
I think they are wired differently.

50:58.936 --> 51:02.239
You know we have one in our group.
Bess. She's a...

51:02.339 --> 51:05.542
she's a doctor at the den, of all places.

51:05.642 --> 51:08.813
Listen, I'm part of a group.
A support group.

51:08.913 --> 51:11.315
With Bess and others from my work.

51:11.415 --> 51:14.718
To talk openly about how we feel.

51:14.818 --> 51:17.587
If you're interested I'll vouch for you.

51:17.687 --> 51:19.961
It might help.

51:21.424 --> 51:23.966
I'd be willing to try.

51:25.895 --> 51:27.736
Great.

51:32.068 --> 51:35.839
Nia, it's me again. Until you give me
some text to work with, I am idle,

51:35.939 --> 51:39.147
and that doesn't seem
like a very good use of my time.

51:40.944 --> 51:42.246
I'm almost finished, Dominic.

51:42.346 --> 51:44.715
All the other illustrators
received their pieces hours ago...

51:44.815 --> 51:46.972
I'm almost finished, Dominic.

51:51.788 --> 51:54.196
But I appreciate your patience.

51:55.292 --> 51:57.499
Of course.

52:52.816 --> 52:55.485
Silas, you made it.

52:55.585 --> 52:57.321
This is great. I'm glad you're here.

52:57.421 --> 53:00.624
Everybody, this is Silas.
The one I was telling you about.

53:00.724 --> 53:03.594
Silas, this is Bess. Peter and Thomas.

53:03.694 --> 53:05.929
Gilead, Max and Alice.

53:06.029 --> 53:08.338
Come take a seat.

53:10.538 --> 53:12.836
...and then after lunch
he just kept staring at me,

53:12.936 --> 53:16.189
like he could tell
I wasn't taking my meds.

53:16.289 --> 53:18.558
And I wanted to say something to him.

53:18.658 --> 53:22.512
But then I thought,
what if I'm just imagining it?

53:22.612 --> 53:25.982
So I turned and walked away.

53:26.082 --> 53:27.852
And all I could think is that he knows.

53:27.952 --> 53:30.921
He's going to report me
and I'm going to get caught.

53:31.021 --> 53:34.072
And I can't stop thinking that.
All the time...

53:34.172 --> 53:36.611
It's natural.
It's happened to every one of us.

53:36.711 --> 53:40.564
Yes, but all I could think is that I am
going to the den. I'm going to the den.

53:40.664 --> 53:44.068
It's over. And they're...

53:47.754 --> 53:49.828
What happens in the den?

53:58.014 --> 54:00.518
Half the people who are
brought in commit suicide.

54:00.618 --> 54:04.355
The staff encourages it
and stand by while it happens.

54:04.455 --> 54:06.157
And that's the preferable option anyway.

54:06.257 --> 54:09.093
Compared to electro restraints
and all the other methods of treatment.

54:09.193 --> 54:12.367
But there is value in living.

54:14.981 --> 54:17.918
Being a hider reminds you of that.

54:18.018 --> 54:20.937
I still don't know how you do it.

54:21.037 --> 54:24.212
Working for health and safety
is hard enough.

54:25.875 --> 54:29.947
Yes, it's difficult to see things
and not be moved.

54:30.047 --> 54:33.883
But that's what being
a hider is all about.

54:33.983 --> 54:36.603
So you do small things to help.

54:36.703 --> 54:39.406
Just looking someone in the eyes,

54:39.506 --> 54:44.115
can make them feel they're not alone.
Give them hope.

54:45.462 --> 54:49.599
But under no circumstances
do you interfere.

54:49.699 --> 54:55.010
You have to tell yourself, do not risk
your job, do not risk your life.

54:58.341 --> 55:02.150
But why stay in a position
where you feel so much risk?

55:02.612 --> 55:07.422
- You could ask to be reassigned.
- I'd rather be with people who feel.

55:08.218 --> 55:10.754
Who feel intensely.

55:11.254 --> 55:15.593
It reminds me of who I am
and why I choose to keep on living.

55:15.693 --> 55:19.196
Everybody says it's not contagious.

55:19.596 --> 55:23.566
But after all these years
as awful as it is,

55:23.666 --> 55:26.936
everyday I feel a stronger...

55:27.036 --> 55:30.245
affinity with other people.

55:32.275 --> 55:34.844
See I don't believe all the research.

55:34.944 --> 55:37.347
Feelings engender feelings.

55:37.447 --> 55:40.751
S.O.S. isn't even a disease,
that's what they say but...

55:40.851 --> 55:44.755
switched off is something they do
to us between conception and birth.

55:44.855 --> 55:46.891
S.O.S. is who we really are and...

55:46.991 --> 55:50.394
the inhibitors are just
another attempt to squash that.

55:50.494 --> 55:53.763
- I don't know.
- It's so hard.

55:53.863 --> 55:56.199
It's lonely.

55:56.499 --> 56:00.370
At least with the inhibitors
I can get by but now...

56:00.470 --> 56:03.206
I would rather feel nothing.

56:03.506 --> 56:06.615
Nothing is better than this.

57:46.042 --> 57:48.667
It's okay. It's okay.

59:15.565 --> 59:19.870
I could never have imagined
what love felt like. It's strange...

59:20.470 --> 59:23.006
like a little tornado going around and...

59:23.106 --> 59:24.831
Yeah.

59:27.810 --> 59:30.736
That's why I was so scared of it at first.

59:35.852 --> 59:39.022
It's about giving,
I want you to take everything,

59:39.122 --> 59:42.860
I don't even know what it is,
I just want you to take it from me.

59:42.960 --> 59:44.794
I just want to...

59:44.894 --> 59:47.102
I want to run.

59:49.766 --> 59:52.201
I want to run... both of us...

59:52.301 --> 59:55.734
as fast as we can, outside, just take off.

59:59.175 --> 01:00:01.544
It's so weird, I'm like...

01:00:01.644 --> 01:00:04.319
I keep on thinking about...

01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:08.452
Ever since we were kids
it's been drilled into us that...

01:00:08.552 --> 01:00:11.388
our purpose is to explore
the universe, you know.

01:00:11.488 --> 01:00:14.290
Outer space is where we'll find...

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:18.600
the answers to why we're here and...

01:00:19.128 --> 01:00:21.664
where we come from.

01:00:21.764 --> 01:00:24.033
It's like everyone's...

01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:29.073
searching for these answers 800
million miles away and the truth is...

01:00:29.173 --> 01:00:31.413
the answers are right in front of us.

01:00:33.042 --> 01:00:35.017
I know why I'm here.

01:00:36.779 --> 01:00:38.820
Me too.

01:00:40.683 --> 01:00:42.685
What are we going to do now?

01:00:42.785 --> 01:00:47.758
We just spend as much time
here together as we can.

01:00:47.858 --> 01:00:51.935
Go to work, act normal, but then...

01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:55.236
at night...

01:00:55.898 --> 01:00:57.490
we're together.

01:00:59.135 --> 01:01:00.976
Okay.

01:01:22.992 --> 01:01:25.697
What did you look like
when you were little?

01:01:27.663 --> 01:01:30.572
Have you always had these freckles?

01:01:32.568 --> 01:01:34.775
I don't know.

01:01:35.004 --> 01:01:37.245
I think so.

01:01:38.007 --> 01:01:40.977
- Did you grow early?
- Did I grow early?

01:01:41.077 --> 01:01:43.285
Yeah, I was tall until I wasn't.

01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:48.624
I was a little round kid.

01:01:55.992 --> 01:01:58.561
What was your favorite subject?

01:01:58.661 --> 01:02:01.395
I liked history. How about you?

01:02:02.325 --> 01:02:04.268
I always really loved to write.

01:02:04.368 --> 01:02:08.113
- What did you write when you were a kid?
- I always liked to write poetry.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.148
I liked the school trips as well.

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:18.945
When we got to go...
to the great war museum...

01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:23.691
to see how the bombs dropped
and wiped out the cities and stuff.

01:02:25.254 --> 01:02:27.724
I see a future outside of this room.

01:02:27.824 --> 01:02:31.662
Some place out there in the vastness
of everything we know.

01:02:32.062 --> 01:02:34.580
In all those millions of miles.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.318
Dominic FYI. The article's finished.

01:02:38.868 --> 01:02:41.305
You gave it to me already.
I'm working on it right now.

01:02:41.405 --> 01:02:46.147
No, the one after this. On the extraction
of superfluids from neutron stars.

01:02:47.843 --> 01:02:49.616
No pressure.

01:02:50.279 --> 01:02:53.749
I wish I could explain this
to everyone else.

01:02:53.849 --> 01:02:57.421
I'm sick of being...
scared of getting caught.

01:02:57.521 --> 01:03:03.165
I want people to know
and not think we're sick.

01:03:35.991 --> 01:03:40.664
<i>The significant breakthrough came
with the isolation of the bulbar cell line,</i>

01:03:40.764 --> 01:03:43.700
<i>allowing an effective
genetic re-silencing,</i>

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.803
<i>without triggering
the systematic organ malfunction</i>

01:03:46.903 --> 01:03:49.106
<i>that had marked earlier attempts.</i>

01:03:49.206 --> 01:03:52.776
<i>To be clear, this is not
another Kappa Rho inhibitor.</i>

01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:57.047
<i>It's a cure that restores the health
and systematic order to the individual.</i>

01:03:57.147 --> 01:04:00.262
<i>With the Ashby Eni cure,
it is only a matter of time</i>

01:04:00.362 --> 01:04:04.988
<i>before all current S.O.S. cases are
treated, and future cases prevented.</i>

01:04:05.088 --> 01:04:07.924
<i>The ENI cure is injected
directly into the neck,</i>

01:04:08.024 --> 01:04:12.362
<i>leaving a small coin-like scar,
a quick and simple procedure.</i>

01:04:12.462 --> 01:04:16.800
<i>Once administered, the drug requires
a six hour absorption period,</i>

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.636
<i>before the disease
is completely neutralized.</i>

01:04:19.736 --> 01:04:22.272
<i>After which point, regardless of stage,</i>

01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:25.142
<i>the patient is restored to normal health.</i>

01:04:25.242 --> 01:04:27.844
<i>Mass production of the drug
is already underway.</i>

01:04:27.944 --> 01:04:31.682
<i>And shipments are being made available
to public clinics immediately.</i>

01:04:31.782 --> 01:04:35.652
<i>Individuals diagnosed with S.O.S.
need not suffer another day.</i>

01:04:35.752 --> 01:04:39.840
<i>Contact your doctor immediately
to receive the Ashby ENI cure...</i>

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.875
<i>and rejoin the ranks of equals...</i>

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:09.865
We're gonna remember this feeling.

01:05:13.756 --> 01:05:17.278
We're gonna live every day remembering
and we're not gonna feel it.

01:05:24.567 --> 01:05:27.043
We're not even gonna exist anymore.

01:05:41.183 --> 01:05:43.554
It's not over.

01:05:45.321 --> 01:05:47.628
We're not doing that.

01:05:52.695 --> 01:05:55.645
- So you don't want the cure.
- No.

01:05:56.131 --> 01:05:58.133
Do you?

01:05:58.233 --> 01:06:00.108
No.

01:06:19.071 --> 01:06:21.312
This is Nia.

01:06:23.525 --> 01:06:26.013
We want to go to the Peninsula.

01:06:28.097 --> 01:06:32.840
At my old post,
I took part in an air patrol.

01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:35.906
We wouldn't fly directly
over the Peninsula, but...

01:06:36.006 --> 01:06:39.443
I could see it from a distance.
It's totally overgrown.

01:06:39.543 --> 01:06:44.114
If anyone actually lives there
it's in a completely primitive state.

01:06:44.214 --> 01:06:47.784
- How do we get there?
- You're seriously considering this?

01:06:47.884 --> 01:06:51.388
- We've already decided.
- You know you'll be on your own out there.

01:06:51.488 --> 01:06:54.157
There will be no one to look after you.

01:06:54.557 --> 01:06:56.893
Whatever we go through
it will be together.

01:06:56.993 --> 01:07:00.764
I know how you're feeling,
but you're not thinking of all the risks.

01:07:00.864 --> 01:07:05.072
If we stay here we'll be found out.
We'll get the cure.

01:07:08.437 --> 01:07:11.223
You know, it's many years ago...

01:07:11.323 --> 01:07:15.594
I was not much older than you are now
when I got the bug,

01:07:15.694 --> 01:07:19.933
no one even knew
what S.O.S. was back then.

01:07:20.033 --> 01:07:24.725
People were getting it, and most
of them would commit suicide.

01:07:25.588 --> 01:07:28.991
There was a young man in my living block,

01:07:29.091 --> 01:07:32.995
I could tell he was a hider, just like me,

01:07:33.095 --> 01:07:36.570
but no one dared mention it back then.

01:07:37.299 --> 01:07:38.841
One night...

01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:42.205
he knocked on my door
and told me that he and two others...

01:07:42.305 --> 01:07:44.908
were going to the Peninsula
and he wanted me to go with him.

01:07:45.008 --> 01:07:48.082
Of course, there was no way I was going.

01:07:48.744 --> 01:07:51.214
I knew they were headed for their deaths.

01:07:51.314 --> 01:07:52.887
Bess.

01:07:56.202 --> 01:08:00.778
A few months after he left
were the loneliest I ever felt.

01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:05.166
We'd only spoken that one time.

01:08:06.695 --> 01:08:10.099
More than all the suicides I've seen.

01:08:10.199 --> 01:08:12.903
It was his death that was the most...

01:08:13.003 --> 01:08:15.571
unnecessarily wasteful.

01:08:15.671 --> 01:08:18.107
Such a waste.

01:08:18.207 --> 01:08:20.796
That was a new feeling for me.

01:08:22.243 --> 01:08:24.917
But you don't know that he died.

01:08:26.381 --> 01:08:28.856
What if he didn't?

01:08:41.263 --> 01:08:45.635
I can talk to my old colleague. He was
the pilot who took us on the air patrol.

01:08:45.734 --> 01:08:50.444
If they get caught, the whole plan could
be traced back to you or to the group.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.586
You said interfering was too risky.

01:08:55.277 --> 01:08:59.995
If you make this decision
you know... there is no turning back.

01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:02.934
If you do manage to get out...

01:09:03.587 --> 01:09:05.961
you can never return.

01:09:07.156 --> 01:09:09.363
Of course.

01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:26.380
When you get to the border
ask for Oliver, he will fly you.

01:09:28.277 --> 01:09:30.613
What if he gets caught?

01:09:30.813 --> 01:09:32.231
He won't.

01:09:34.683 --> 01:09:36.924
Good luck.

01:09:40.055 --> 01:09:41.490
Thank you.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.788
Welling is the closest station
to the border.

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:55.972
Trains don't go there until the weekend.
I checked the schedule.

01:09:56.072 --> 01:09:58.478
We could leave on Saturday.

01:09:59.942 --> 01:10:01.783
Three days.

01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:09.423
- You're shaking.
- So are you.

01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:15.820
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Are you?

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.342
I got a conception summons.

01:11:03.972 --> 01:11:05.005
We're leaving in two days.

01:11:05.105 --> 01:11:08.061
By the time they come looking
for you we'll be gone. Ignore it.

01:11:08.161 --> 01:11:09.980
My tag is blocked,
I'm not gonna get on the train.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.281
I won't make it through
any of the check points.

01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:15.088
Look, it's just a summons, right?

01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:18.588
It's not like they're going
to inseminate you...

01:11:18.688 --> 01:11:22.229
They'll check my blood.
They'll see I have the disease instantly.

01:11:22.424 --> 01:11:24.794
Yeah, but they can't force you
to get the cure.

01:11:24.894 --> 01:11:27.130
I've been diagnosed,
no one's forcing me to get it, are they?

01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:29.598
Besides, the clinics
are overwhelmed right now.

01:11:29.698 --> 01:11:33.270
All that's going to happen is, they'll
tell you you've tested positive for S.O.S.,

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:37.866
and that you should see your doctor
immediately, that's it. Then get out of there.

01:11:39.308 --> 01:11:41.376
Nothing's changed.

01:11:41.476 --> 01:11:45.014
We're leaving Saturday, 10 o'clock train.
You've missed the whole morning of work.

01:11:45.114 --> 01:11:47.550
You should get over there right away.
I'll come after my shift.

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:49.652
Meet me behind the clinic.

01:11:49.752 --> 01:11:51.342
Okay.

01:12:02.864 --> 01:12:05.572
I received a summons.

01:12:23.352 --> 01:12:25.488
- Hello, Nia.
- Hello, doctor.

01:12:25.588 --> 01:12:28.095
Lie back for me, please.

01:12:31.059 --> 01:12:33.096
I'm going to take a sample
of your blood, okay?

01:12:33.196 --> 01:12:35.069
Okay.

01:12:50.646 --> 01:12:53.049
I have the bug, don't I?

01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:56.194
Nia, you're pregnant.

01:15:40.349 --> 01:15:42.151
- What is it?
- She's pregnant.

01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:46.522
She got called for conception duty and they
found out. They're taking her to the den.

01:15:46.622 --> 01:15:48.891
- You need to calm down.
- I'm calm, I'm calm, it's fine.

01:15:48.991 --> 01:15:51.294
- When did they take her?
- About an hour ago or something.

01:15:51.394 --> 01:15:53.994
- Well, listen, I will contact Bess...
- No, no. No. Not Bess.

01:15:54.094 --> 01:15:57.700
- She won't help us. Ask someone else.
- There is no one else. Bess is our only hope.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.336
Listen, you can't be seen
around here like this.

01:16:00.436 --> 01:16:02.774
I'm fine, but let me come with you.
Let me help her...

01:16:02.874 --> 01:16:05.744
- Go home, I'll contact you. Wait there.
- I can talk to them. Let me go with you.

01:16:05.844 --> 01:16:08.338
Don't attempt to see Nia.

01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:10.847
Silas, go home. Trust me.

01:16:10.947 --> 01:16:13.783
- What are they gonna do to her?
- Just calm down.

01:16:13.883 --> 01:16:17.386
You need to stay calm,
or they'll give you the cure.

01:16:17.486 --> 01:16:21.428
Give me a couple hours.
Go home and wait there.

01:18:28.583 --> 01:18:31.721
- Jonas?
- Get dressed as fast as you can.

01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:34.056
And listen to me carefully,

01:18:34.156 --> 01:18:37.481
last week, a woman
was brought in called Eva.

01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:42.198
She was stage three. Last night she
knotted a garbage bag over her head,

01:18:42.298 --> 01:18:44.466
suffocated, she's dead.

01:18:44.566 --> 01:18:47.870
Now you... are going
to switch places with her.

01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:51.140
Eva didn't kill herself
last night, you did.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.409
You are Eva, she was you.

01:18:53.509 --> 01:18:55.944
- You're gonna walk out of here.
- Just...

01:18:56.044 --> 01:18:59.714
Hold out your arm. Your left arm please.

01:18:59.814 --> 01:19:01.622
Okay.

01:19:02.784 --> 01:19:04.971
All right.

01:19:06.271 --> 01:19:08.745
You are Eva.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:12.800
- Got it?
- Ready?

01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:30.174
I told Silas to wait at his apartment.
You'll find him there.

01:21:39.374 --> 01:21:43.212
<i>The following message is an update
on the security breach at the den.</i>

01:21:43.312 --> 01:21:46.649
<i>The Collective wishes to congratulate
health and safety official,</i>

01:21:46.749 --> 01:21:50.192
<i>I.D.: 22564943</i>

01:21:50.292 --> 01:21:55.124
<i>who alerted authorities to three individuals
operating against protocol at the den.</i>

01:21:55.224 --> 01:21:57.827
<i>Two of the three were health
and safety officials,</i>

01:21:57.927 --> 01:22:00.329
<i>and the third was a physician at the den.</i>

01:22:00.429 --> 01:22:03.900
<i>All are currently safe

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.970
<i>So that they may return to work as
productive equals in the Collective.</i>

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:11.507
<i>The ENI cure will now be required

01:22:11.607 --> 01:22:13.342
<i>or suffering from S.O.S.</i>

01:22:13.442 --> 01:22:16.645
<i>And mandatory S.O.S. testing
will begin immediately,</i>

01:22:16.745 --> 01:22:21.283
<i>for all health and safety officials
as well as medical professionals.</i>

01:22:21.983 --> 01:22:23.792

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:38.005
- You said her name was Nia?
- Yes.

01:22:40.401 --> 01:22:42.570
Was she brought here yesterday evening?

01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:45.745

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:58.558
Could you... could you check that again?

01:23:03.057 --> 01:23:05.098
Yes, that's her.

01:23:14.302 --> 01:23:16.143
Sir?

01:23:17.405 --> 01:23:19.679
Are you okay?

01:23:21.843 --> 01:23:24.384
Do you need some help?

01:26:49.984 --> 01:26:52.358
Where have you been?

01:26:53.354 --> 01:26:55.229
Hey.

01:27:02.163 --> 01:27:04.434
You okay?

01:27:13.491 --> 01:27:15.265
Why?

01:27:17.478 --> 01:27:20.453
I thought... I thought you were gone.

01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:31.719
How long do you have?

01:27:31.859 --> 01:27:34.334
Maybe five hours.

01:27:44.973 --> 01:27:46.813
Silas.

01:27:52.113 --> 01:27:53.920
Hey.

01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:58.524
Fight it.

01:28:00.154 --> 01:28:04.159
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.
Fight it. Okay?

01:28:04.859 --> 01:28:07.066
I'm still pregnant.

01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:17.370
We're going to get
on the train tomorrow. Okay?

01:28:21.309 --> 01:28:23.550
I love you.

01:28:25.279 --> 01:28:29.756
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

01:28:43.865 --> 01:28:47.068
You have to fight it. Just fight it, okay?

01:28:47.668 --> 01:28:50.376
I can already tell it's in me.

01:28:53.441 --> 01:28:56.978
Just remember... okay?

01:28:57.578 --> 01:28:59.452
How?

01:29:03.317 --> 01:29:05.658
Remember this feeling.

01:29:07.989 --> 01:29:10.863
Just remember what this feels like.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.478
Yeah, just promise me, no matter...

01:29:16.578 --> 01:29:20.135
what happens you keep loving me,
no matter what I say,

01:29:20.235 --> 01:29:25.040
what I feel or don't feel, I'm still...
I'm still in here trying. Okay?

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:29.044
I'm still in here.
Just don't give up on me.

01:29:29.144 --> 01:29:32.732
- Please, don't give up on me.
- I promise.

01:29:33.361 --> 01:29:36.141
I promise that I won't...

01:30:25.866 --> 01:30:27.574
Silas?

01:30:31.739 --> 01:30:33.913
Good morning.

01:30:41.482 --> 01:30:43.723
Do you still love me?

01:30:50.124 --> 01:30:52.694
I remember I loved you.

01:30:53.394 --> 01:30:55.235
But...

01:30:57.098 --> 01:30:59.472
I don't feel it anymore.

01:31:05.973 --> 01:31:08.347
Do you still want to go?

01:31:09.777 --> 01:31:12.084
We made a plan.

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.894
Right.

01:32:02.129 --> 01:32:07.369
<i>This is a non-local transport serving
outlying regions with three stops.</i>

01:32:07.469 --> 01:32:11.812
<i>The final destination port will be
Welling at the outer Peninsula.</i>

01:32:11.912 --> 01:32:14.617
