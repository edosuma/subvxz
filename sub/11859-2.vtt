WEBVTT

00:20.500 --> 00:22.291
Dad.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.542
It's too much.

00:23.625 --> 00:25.417
Well, it's yours, baby.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.000
They have public transportation

00:30.083 --> 00:31.291
in Philadelphia, you know.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.583
Now you won't
have to use
it.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.083
Dad, you've got
to stop worrying about me.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.417
I'm gonna be fine.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.083
Your degree,
your brains

00:37.166 --> 00:39.083
you could do
anything you
want.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.583
Law school,
politics,
Wall Street--

00:41.667 --> 00:43.709
But, Dad..

00:43.792 --> 00:45.583
...this is what I want.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.875
Laura McKinney?

01:01.959 --> 01:03.417
I'm Margaret Trudlow.
You're late.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.625
Sorry. Got a little lost.

01:05.709 --> 01:07.667
We had an unexpected change
in faculty.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.792
One of our US History
teachers,
Mr. Hack, had an incident.

01:10.875 --> 01:11.834
"Incident"?

01:11.917 --> 01:13.041
Run-in with some
seniors last year.

01:13.125 --> 01:14.291
Nothing for you
to worry about

01:14.375 --> 01:15.792
but you'll cover
his class this year.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.125
I-I'm supposed to teach English.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.625
I'm not familiar
with US History.

01:20.709 --> 01:22.041
Neither are the students.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.208
No problem.
Ready for the
challenge.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.041
Now, that's
the Ivy League spirit.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.250
This is yours.

01:40.208 --> 01:42.458
My classroom's next
door
if you have any issues

01:42.542 --> 01:44.500
but I'm sure you won't.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.333
Any advice?

01:46.417 --> 01:47.917
Show no fear.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.583
(Laura)
'Hi, class.'

01:55.667 --> 01:57.959
My name is Miss McKinney.

01:58.041 --> 01:59.625
(Laura)
'Can you turn
that down, please?'

01:59.709 --> 02:01.875
Excuse me.
Settle down, guys.

02:01.959 --> 02:03.542
Can-can you please
take your seat?

02:03.625 --> 02:04.959
Hey.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.917
Girls. Girls. Stop it.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.166
Stop it. Stop it, stop it.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.542
Someone helping you?

02:57.625 --> 03:00.333
They told me to wait
for one of those
detectives.

03:00.417 --> 03:01.625
One sec.

03:12.709 --> 03:14.583
Uh..

03:14.667 --> 03:16.208
...they look pretty busy.

03:16.291 --> 03:17.333
Why don't you talk to me?

03:17.417 --> 03:19.041
Darnell Brent.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.750
I'm Detective Rush.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.625
Think I have evidence
on Laura McKinney's
murder.

03:23.709 --> 03:24.959
She was my teacher
at Reeves High

03:25.041 --> 03:28.125
got shot outside
the school in
1991.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.792
They said it was
a carjacking gone
wrong.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.166
You know different?

03:34.250 --> 03:35.500
Just got my
teaching
credential.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.291
Started at Reeves last week.

03:37.375 --> 03:38.834
Coincidence?

03:38.917 --> 03:40.458
She's the reason I'm doing it.

03:40.542 --> 03:41.750
Always challenged us
to make a difference.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.625
Figured it
was about time I
tried.

03:43.709 --> 03:45.166
Well, what'd you find, Darnell?

03:45.250 --> 03:47.458
So I'm there this weekend,
getting my classroom ready.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.750
Found this old,
sturdy desk in
storage

03:49.834 --> 03:51.291
they used to have
when I was a
student.

03:51.375 --> 03:55.125
I was going through
the drawers, and I find
these.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.959
They're her keys,
including her car
keys.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.000
Miss McKinney wouldn't have
left
the classroom without them

04:00.083 --> 04:01.291
never mind the building.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.041
Ah, people forget
their keys all the time.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.750
I've worked
at the school two
days.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.875
First thing you learn
don't go
anywhere without your
keys.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.583
- The school's locked down?
- Especially at night.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.417
Can't get from one door
to the other without
them.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.375
Miss McKinney
would've known
that.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.834
She wasn't going to her car.

04:13.917 --> 04:16.834
So if she wasn't headed
to her car, where was she
going?

04:16.917 --> 04:18.250
I don't know.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.333
I've got to say, Darnell..

04:21.417 --> 04:22.333
...not a lot to go on.

04:22.417 --> 04:24.834
Look, uh, I know you're busy.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.834
But I can't let this sit.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.875
After everything
Miss McKinney did for
me..

04:32.291 --> 04:34.166
Sounds like
she was a special teacher.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.208
Yeah...the best.

04:38.792 --> 04:40.458
I owe her.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.375
It was Valens, right?

05:17.458 --> 05:20.542
He still hot over that
pudding pop thing last month?

05:20.625 --> 05:21.959
I'm no snitch.

05:22.041 --> 05:24.458
You're either with me
or you're against me.

05:25.834 --> 05:28.208
Consider me warned.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.542
Laura McKinney

05:34.625 --> 05:37.041
22, just out of college.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.792
Killed in front of
the school, 10:00 at
night.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.917
Last to see
was Margaret Trudlow

05:41.000 --> 05:42.458
another teacher, hours earlier.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.000
- She was in Teach for
America.
- A cousin of mine did that.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.458
It's like
the Peace Corps.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.750
Grads spend a couple of years
in the worst public schools.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.375
- Uh, it takes guts doing
that.
- Or a loose screw.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.750
Well, sometimes those
are the best teachers.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.709
Always that one
you remember,
right?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.333
Shot once in
the back with a
0.22.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.250
Doer left
the shell
casing.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.750
Not to mention the car.

06:03.834 --> 06:07.583
She's found just steps
from her vehicle, but no
keys.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.625
- Witnesses?
- We got a Mrs. Harris.

06:09.709 --> 06:11.333
Lived across
from the school.

06:11.417 --> 06:13.542
Sees a black man
fleeing the scene.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.000
Reeves High School
security guard was
closer.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.625
Carlton Rawls
eyeballs the
doer

06:19.709 --> 06:21.792
standing over Laura's
body
and chases him off.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.417
Our hero, almost.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.583
But neither witness
saw
the doer pull the
trigger.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.542
Let alone the gun.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.166
(Stillman)
'Victim's father coming in?'

06:38.250 --> 06:39.959
Yeah, taking the train
from New York.

06:40.041 --> 06:42.125
He still blames himself
for getting her the car.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.834
If I'd had a kid go teach
at that school

06:43.917 --> 06:45.291
I'd give him a 0.38.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.959
Hmm, '91 was
a record year for homicides.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.750
Five hundred and one.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.750
Original
detectives
were overworked.

06:51.834 --> 06:54.291
Witness testimony,
placement of the body

06:54.375 --> 06:55.750
they focused
on the robbery
angle.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.208
Leaving out
the
personal.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.667
Maybe connected
to the school.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.125
(Jeffries)
'Great, thank you.'

07:00.208 --> 07:02.458
Second eyewitness,
old Mrs. Harris.

07:02.542 --> 07:05.166
Says she'd love to meet,
talk about what she saw.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.583
Only not today,
her dog's getting groomed.

07:07.667 --> 07:08.959
And tomorrow's book club.

07:09.041 --> 07:11.375
- Ah, playing hard to get.
- 'Yeah.'

07:11.458 --> 07:12.667
Lives in Camden.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.875
Figured I'd swing by,
pay her a visit.

07:14.959 --> 07:17.291
Anybody up for a drive?

07:18.583 --> 07:21.333
Taking that as a "no."

07:21.417 --> 07:24.250
Heading down to Ballistics
about the murder weapon.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.250
IBIS database
didn't exist in '91.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.291
'Could be useful now.'

07:27.375 --> 07:29.333
Gun's out there
17 years, Nick.

07:29.417 --> 07:32.166
Any luck, it was used
in another crime.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.250
"Luck"?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.458
You know what I mean.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.750
Nick.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.875
They got ties, three for ten
bucks on the corner over
there.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.208
You might want
to take a look.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.542
I wouldn't let her
take the subway.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.000
"It's too dangerous," I said.

07:59.083 --> 08:00.834
Well, we're looking
at the possibility

08:00.917 --> 08:02.709
this wasn't
about Laura's
car.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.875
She ever mention
any personal problems?

08:04.959 --> 08:08.917
I talked to her on
the phone at least twice a
week.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.417
Far as I could tell,
her life was work and home.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.208
- No guys in the picture?
- No, not that I knew of.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.041
I mean that job
completely consumed her.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.750
- She stay late, after
school?
- All the time.

08:18.834 --> 08:21.000
- She believed in the program.
- You didn't?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.208
Well, they sent her out
full of big ideas.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.625
'How she'd make her mark.'

08:24.709 --> 08:26.917
Didn't tell her that
no one else was on board.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.458
This place is a disaster area.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.834
Dad.

08:34.917 --> 08:36.709
We've got
reservations
in half an hour.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.583
Did you forget?

08:40.875 --> 08:43.125
I know it's bad here.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.041
I'm going
to paint my classroom next.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.417
Plant some flowers
in the spring.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.417
Give it a sense of hope.

08:52.333 --> 08:53.458
You okay, baby?

08:58.166 --> 09:01.291
These kids,
they can barely read

09:01.375 --> 09:03.166
let alone write.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.875
I can't control them.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.166
They won't even listen to me.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.333
- You're doing your best.
- Look at me.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.291
No matter how much
extra effort I put in

09:13.375 --> 09:14.792
I still can't get through.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.625
Hey, listen

09:18.709 --> 09:21.792
when I started out,
working legal aid in
Newark

09:21.875 --> 09:23.250
I stunk at my job.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.500
I couldn't win a case.

09:25.583 --> 09:28.000
One day an older lawyer
pulled me aside.

09:28.083 --> 09:29.959
Told me,
"Forget about the facts.

09:30.041 --> 09:33.291
Just tell the jury a story."

09:33.375 --> 09:34.792
"A story."

09:34.875 --> 09:37.125
Isn't that what
history's all
about?

09:39.458 --> 09:41.625
Come on, look.
Don't kill
yourself.

09:41.709 --> 09:44.333
A job shouldn't do this to you.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.166
This is more than
a job to me, Dad.

09:49.834 --> 09:52.125
I made a commitment.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.458
I'm gonna see it through.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.458
That was Laura.

09:59.542 --> 10:00.792
Determined to make a difference.

10:01.959 --> 10:04.083
I don't know
if she even got the chance.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.083
I think she did, Mr. McKinney.

10:06.166 --> 10:09.166
It was one of her
students
who brought these in.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.375
Remembered her all this time.

10:13.583 --> 10:16.500
The teachers
she worked
with..

10:16.583 --> 10:18.125
...she ever mention any of them?

10:18.208 --> 10:21.834
I-I don't think they-they went
out of their way to welcome
her.

10:21.917 --> 10:23.500
Why's that?

10:23.583 --> 10:25.875
Laura did the same job
for less money.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.333
Guess they perceived
the program as a threat.

10:28.417 --> 10:31.667
Any teachers give
Laura
a particularly hard
time?

10:31.750 --> 10:34.750
A woman with
a class next door, Margaret.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.291
Supposed to be her mentor.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.917
Sounded more like a menace.

10:43.333 --> 10:44.709
How you doing, Carla?

10:44.792 --> 10:48.542
I got a cold one needs
running through IBIS
ASAP.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.625
- Two weeks.
- It's kind of important.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.375
- Aren't they all?
- Yeah, I hear you.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.333
I'm talking
special circumstances.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.625
The victim was a
teacher,
you know what I mean?

10:57.709 --> 11:00.000
Remember your favorite teacher?
Imagine if she got killed.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.959
I hated my teachers.

11:03.041 --> 11:04.333
Look, we need to expedite this.

11:04.417 --> 11:07.000
Any other
forms
to fill out?

11:07.083 --> 11:10.083
No other forms, no exceptions.
Fresh jobs get priority.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.750
Take a number.
Come back in two weeks.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.291
Okay? Okay.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.291
Only thing I
remember
from that night

11:30.375 --> 11:32.333
is I left at 5:00 p.m. sharp

11:32.417 --> 11:36.417
and Laura was still
in her classroom as
usual.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.625
Here's your
list
of students.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.291
I highlighted the troubled ones.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.333
A lot of names.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.000
Only the best and brightest.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.792
Perk of
the public school system.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.792
Well, uh, how'd
you get along with Laura?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.417
Miss McKinney
was nice enough.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.667
Here every night till 10:00

11:51.750 --> 11:54.000
grading papers,
doing lesson
plans.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.417
- That's a good teacher.
- I didn't say that.

11:59.083 --> 12:02.417
Try sitting up straight.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.041
Oh, way we heard it, you had
it
in for Laura from day one.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.625
How would you like it if
some kid straight out of
school

12:07.709 --> 12:09.083
came in to the police department

12:09.166 --> 12:10.667
thinking they
had all the
answers?

12:10.750 --> 12:12.792
She thought this was
some kind of mission.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.250
But she didn't
have
the training.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.375
- Or the requisite skills..
- Such as?

12:16.458 --> 12:18.125
She couldn't even
control
her classroom.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.458
It's sink or swim,
and Laura was drowning.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.917
Sounded like
World War III.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.291
I come in, everybody's
up out of their seats

12:26.375 --> 12:27.959
and she's just
standing
there, helpless.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.458
Oh, come on, Margaret.
She's not that bad.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.166
She won't make
it
till Christmas.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.667
I was hoping to talk
to you about these
textbooks.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.333
- What about them?
- There aren't enough of them.

12:42.417 --> 12:43.834
I went to the
principal,
he said I couldn't

12:43.917 --> 12:46.667
order new materials
until Christmas
break.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.166
What's the joke?

12:56.083 --> 12:58.333
If you last that long

12:58.417 --> 13:00.834
you can ask Santa
for the extra books.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.834
Teaching's about more
than a winning smile.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.291
She wasn't cut out for it.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.625
A guy who stuck up
for Laura.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.417
- He liked her?
- Kenny Yates.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.083
He didn't have
to share a wall with
her.

13:21.166 --> 13:24.000
- He still teach here?
- Left for greener pastures.

13:24.083 --> 13:27.709
Parochial school.
Less money, more
respect.

13:27.792 --> 13:30.750
This is a dangerous place,
huh?
Pepper spray?

13:30.834 --> 13:31.875
Need some kind of protection

13:31.959 --> 13:33.583
if you're gonna
last
as long as I
have.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.500
Laura didn't have her keys
the night she was killed.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.125
- Figures.
- What happens?

13:38.208 --> 13:41.917
Situation like that, late
at night, no one else around.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.625
You go to the security guard.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.583
Always on post at
the front
entrance.

13:45.667 --> 13:49.625
Yeah, back in '91,
it's a Carlton Rawls?

13:49.709 --> 13:52.000
He was our last
line of defense.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.834
(Rush)
'Now, thanks
for meeting us, Carlton.'

13:57.917 --> 13:59.583
No sweat.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.917
Working security across town.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.250
They're cool
with me being
here

14:03.333 --> 14:05.458
being first responder and all.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.125
Walk us through
what you remember.

14:07.208 --> 14:10.000
I was at my post,
just inside here.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.875
Shot rang out,
I'm through the door.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.166
She was right
here
on the street.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.959
Number one male
standing over her.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.667
'He figured he
was taking her car.'

14:24.750 --> 14:26.709
He thought different
when he saw me rushing him.

14:26.792 --> 14:29.041
He busted ass the other way.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.208
A compelling story, Carlton.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.750
What?
That's what
happened.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.542
See, Carlton,
we got the other witness

14:36.625 --> 14:40.333
saw the suspect running past
her apartment window that way.

14:40.417 --> 14:42.250
That means the suspect
would've been running

14:42.333 --> 14:44.834
towards you, not away. Right?

14:44.917 --> 14:48.542
You weren't at
your post. Where were you?

14:48.625 --> 14:50.500
- I'm telling you, I--
- No, see, you're lying.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.583
You keep it up, we're gonna
start thinking bad things.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.709
I was in the parking lot.

14:58.792 --> 15:01.041
- My car.
- Sleeping one off?

15:01.125 --> 15:03.291
I smell the whiskey
on your breath.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.041
You see the gun, Carlton?

15:05.125 --> 15:06.333
Suspect's face?

15:06.417 --> 15:07.792
Hey, you see anything?

15:07.875 --> 15:10.125
Guy running away down the block.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.959
Look, I had my eye
out,
even from the car.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.959
Every door in
the school was
padlocked

15:15.041 --> 15:16.583
from the inside except for two.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.208
Which ones?

15:18.291 --> 15:20.000
The one to the parking
lot,
which is where I was

15:20.083 --> 15:22.959
and where Laura should've come
if she was going to her car.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.834
(Rush)
'She didn't have
her keys, Carlton.'

15:24.917 --> 15:27.375
Say she wasn't going to her car.

15:29.458 --> 15:32.667
She still would've come
out
through the parking lot.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.834
- And I'd have been there.
- Why?

15:34.917 --> 15:36.125
What's this other door?

15:36.208 --> 15:38.625
Back alley where
the garbage goes.

15:38.709 --> 15:41.625
Told her time and time again
not to use this door.

15:41.709 --> 15:43.250
Locks automatically
when you go out.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.458
Figure she was
in trouble inside.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.542
You weren't
at your post.

15:48.625 --> 15:51.166
Probably she
was looking for
you.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.250
Don't know why
she didn't listen.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.500
Knew it was bad out here.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.667
Maybe something
inside was worse.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.208
Oh, understand you
looked out for
Laura.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.542
She was a kid
out of her element.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.625
Came to me for advice.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.083
You two close?

16:19.166 --> 16:21.625
Work buddies.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.542
Sorry. Nasty habit.

16:23.625 --> 16:25.208
Can't think straight without it.

16:25.291 --> 16:26.375
Quit recent?

16:26.458 --> 16:28.709
Yeah, five years ago.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.250
Off again, on again
kind of thing.

16:31.333 --> 16:32.709
You know, Margaret Trudlow said

16:32.792 --> 16:36.583
that Laura was having
difficulty
with her students.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.417
Left her to fend for herself.
Laura did the best she could.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.375
How'd the students
feel
about Laura's best?

16:41.458 --> 16:44.792
This school was
a glorified detention
facility.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.500
It was endearing how naive

16:46.583 --> 16:49.667
she was
about the kids' potential.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.083
Textbook's outdated.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.500
We don't have
enough of them.

16:52.583 --> 16:54.750
The copies that we do
have are falling apart.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.125
No wonder
the kids don't care.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.959
Welcome to Reeves.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.917
Look, at least now you
have control of your
students.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.917
Getting them to sit down
and be quiet isn't teaching.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.083
You've taught here ten years.
How do you do it?

17:06.166 --> 17:09.250
Simple. Concentrate
on the students who do
care

17:09.333 --> 17:10.458
if you could find one.

17:10.542 --> 17:13.291
Just forget the rest.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.625
Forget them?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.417
What?

17:26.500 --> 17:27.458
Oh, what are you doing?

17:33.500 --> 17:34.625
Take your seats.

17:34.709 --> 17:38.125
Textbooks out.

17:38.208 --> 17:42.291
Now toss them on the floor.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.125
Come on, We don't
have all day.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.417
Great. Darnell, will you pass
these out for me?

17:52.500 --> 17:54.417
One to each student.

17:54.500 --> 17:58.166
History is not just
something from the past.

17:58.250 --> 18:01.291
It's a story,
happening every day.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.917
Each of you will pick
a story out of the paper.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.834
We'll read it
and discuss what it means to
us

18:06.917 --> 18:08.291
and to the rest of the world.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.500
Do we get to keep these?

18:11.583 --> 18:13.834
Yes.

18:19.417 --> 18:21.166
What's the problem?

18:22.750 --> 18:25.500
Bitch thinks she can
buy us for 35 cents.

18:31.542 --> 18:34.667
Out, Renaldo.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.083
Now.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.166
No matter how hard you try

18:55.250 --> 18:56.750
there's gonna be the bad apples.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.000
Got any names?

18:58.083 --> 18:59.959
Too many to remember.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.208
Reason I got out.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.333
Bad for the health.

19:02.417 --> 19:05.583
Nothing changes
if nothing changes.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.834
Been chasing our witness
Mrs. Harris all over
Camden.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.875
Neighbor says she plays
bingo,
but won't say where

19:11.959 --> 19:15.500
without a faxed
request
on police letterhead.

19:15.583 --> 19:20.208
Damn.

19:20.291 --> 19:21.750
When you do get her,
have her look through

19:21.834 --> 19:23.166
old Reeves High
yearbooks.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.208
- You got a suspect?
- Yeah, finally.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.792
Kid in Laura's class
named Renaldo Ramos.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.542
Got expelled
a few weeks after her
murder

19:29.625 --> 19:31.041
for stealing from
the teachers'
lounge.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.250
Rap sheet's
an inch
thick.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.125
- You locate him?
- Not yet.

19:34.208 --> 19:37.542
Brought in the mother
to fill in the blanks.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.291
Of Course it'd help
if we had some
information

19:39.375 --> 19:41.458
on the murder weapon.

19:41.542 --> 19:44.208
Not my fault. Lab rat Carla's
gumming up the works.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.208
Thinking maybe
the boss can call in.

19:46.291 --> 19:48.166
Chain of command's
fine for other cops

19:48.250 --> 19:50.166
but civilians
don't respect rank.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.500
You got
a better
idea?

19:51.583 --> 19:54.375
Two words. "Baked goods".

19:54.458 --> 19:57.291
I'm sayin' Renaldo
ain't been around.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.250
You told me.
No address, no phone.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.083
He's a grown man.
He don't share nothin' with
me.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.583
Yeah, well, we got
some questions for him.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.709
About that teacher,
this one already told
me.

20:04.792 --> 20:05.917
Uh, school says you filed

20:06.000 --> 20:08.125
a discrimination
complaint against her.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.625
Woman had it out for my boy.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.875
Keepin' him after
school
for detention.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.709
Had the nerve to bring me in,
tell me Renaldo's got
problems.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.333
Like with attitude?

20:19.750 --> 20:22.000
Some kind of
learning
disability.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.625
Wanted him to take
all this testing.

20:24.709 --> 20:25.959
Where's the discrimination?

20:26.041 --> 20:27.542
Ten years in the school system

20:27.625 --> 20:29.458
no one ever say
boo
about my kid.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.834
All of a sudden,
there's
disabilities.

20:31.917 --> 20:33.500
'Cause Laura was trying to help.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.166
Look, I'm not
heartless,
you know.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.291
Woman didn't deserve to die.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.834
Just should've
minded
her own business.

20:41.917 --> 20:44.291
Mind lettin' Renaldo know
we'd like to talk to him?

20:44.375 --> 20:45.875
I told you he ain't been around.

20:45.959 --> 20:49.125
Several times...just in case.

20:57.417 --> 21:01.542
You buyin' this?
Renaldo not being around?

21:01.625 --> 21:03.375
Me neither.

21:06.125 --> 21:09.083
Fresh scones. Assorted flavors.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.000
A little thank you
for all your hard work.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.834
Lookin' to kill me?

21:12.917 --> 21:15.166
I have celiac disease.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.041
I'm allergic to wheat.

21:18.458 --> 21:21.917
Uh, Carla,
I'm tryin' to play ball
here.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.625
I need that ballistics
report.
I'm beggin' you.

21:24.709 --> 21:26.583
What's it gonna take?

21:28.375 --> 21:30.458
I like musicals.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.959
Thanks for coming
back in, Darnell.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.458
Wondering if you remember
a kid from school.

21:41.542 --> 21:44.166
- A Renaldo Ramos?
- Renaldo Ramos.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.333
Haven't heard that name
in a while.

21:46.417 --> 21:49.417
- He's in jail, right?
- In and out.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.125
You ever hear about him
bringin' a gun to school?

21:52.208 --> 21:54.166
You think he killed
Miss McKinney?

21:54.250 --> 21:57.458
We know he had problems
with her.

21:57.542 --> 21:59.458
The other teachers
had given up on him.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.041
Miss McKinney
tried
to take him on

22:01.125 --> 22:02.834
as a sort of project,
but he made it hard.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.625
You ever hear him threaten her?

22:04.709 --> 22:06.709
No, but it wouldn't surprise me.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.000
He was already half a thug,
even then.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.250
You're late, Renaldo.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.250
Go inside. Take out your
workbook. I'll be in there
soon.

22:20.333 --> 22:21.917
- Forgot it.
- Again?

22:22.000 --> 22:26.083
How is that possible?
No workbook, no pen, no
paper.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.583
I mean, what do you
even keep in here?

22:27.667 --> 22:31.583
I am trying to work with
you,
but I can't.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.583
What is this? Drugs?

22:33.667 --> 22:35.250
Those aren't mine.

22:35.333 --> 22:38.000
(Kenny)
'What's up?'

22:38.083 --> 22:40.542
Renaldo givin' you a hard time?

22:40.625 --> 22:42.917
It's fine. I got it covered.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.250
- When did this happen?
- I don't know.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.417
A few weeks
before Miss McKinney died.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.041
Never thought to mention it?

22:59.125 --> 23:02.041
At Reeves, stuff like that
was
the rule, not the
exception.

23:02.125 --> 23:04.667
Miss McKinney said
she had it under control.

23:10.959 --> 23:13.291
Renaldo must have loved
growin' up here.

23:13.375 --> 23:14.875
Hmm.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.750
That from Saccardo?

23:23.834 --> 23:25.250
Yeah.

23:25.333 --> 23:28.125
What's up with those
boots of his?

23:28.208 --> 23:29.875
What do you mean?

23:29.959 --> 23:31.041
Sayin'.

23:31.125 --> 23:33.125
He's in Narcotics.
It's their thing.

23:33.208 --> 23:34.792
I was in Narcotics.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.542
Never wore Timberlands.

23:39.959 --> 23:43.041
Pay dirt, five o'clock.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.250
Renaldo Ramos?

24:00.417 --> 24:01.917
What happened?
What you do to him?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.208
What did you do to my boy?

24:03.291 --> 24:05.667
- Hey, look.
- He's fine, Ma.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.667
Thanks for all your help.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.500
(Stillman)
'Hell of a sheet, Renaldo.'

24:14.583 --> 24:15.792
Assault, robbery, auto theft.

24:15.875 --> 24:17.041
Even back at Reeves High.

24:17.125 --> 24:18.583
Stealin' from the
teachers' lounge.

24:18.667 --> 24:19.834
(Renaldo)
'That wasn't me.'

24:19.917 --> 24:23.291
Prison, parole, prison again.

24:23.375 --> 24:24.667
Maybe crime isn't your thing.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.250
Yeah, like those drugs, Renaldo.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.041
(Valens)
'The ones Laura McKinney
found in your backpack.'

24:28.125 --> 24:29.709
(Stillman)
'You and Miss McKinney
didn't get along.'

24:29.792 --> 24:30.959
Always singlin' you out.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.208
(Valens)
'Oh, I get it.'

24:32.291 --> 24:35.333
Had this one teacher,
Sister Beatrice.

24:35.417 --> 24:38.542
Chew gum in class.
Thwap! Instant retribution.

24:38.625 --> 24:41.875
That how Miss McKinney was?
Tough on you, Renaldo?

24:41.959 --> 24:43.709
She was cool.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.041
How's that?

24:45.125 --> 24:46.417
Could have narc'd me out.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.041
Just kicked me
back
to the rejects
class.

24:49.125 --> 24:50.583
That's because
you threatened her?

24:50.667 --> 24:52.417
Let her know what would happen
if you turned her in?

24:52.500 --> 24:54.375
I was dyin'
to get out of
school.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.458
But that lady
just wouldn't let
go.

24:56.542 --> 24:58.667
Gettin' on your case,
bringing your moms down on you.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.959
Nah man. She was different
from other teachers.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.583
'Like, she expected something.'

25:02.667 --> 25:06.333
In a good way.
Kind of made school
okay.

25:27.834 --> 25:29.083
What is it?

25:29.166 --> 25:31.583
- What do you think it is?
- Stupid.

25:31.667 --> 25:35.166
You can go back to the bus
Renaldo. Is that what you
want?

25:35.250 --> 25:37.375
It's just an empty lot, Miss.

25:37.458 --> 25:40.250
That's what it is
now.
But not always.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.917
200 years ago,
they brought slaves here.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.458
Auctioned on this very spot,
only a mile

25:46.542 --> 25:49.959
from where the Declaration
of Independence was signed.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.125
(McKinney)
'Hey, wake up!'

25:54.208 --> 25:55.959
Okay, this is important.

25:56.041 --> 25:57.291
'We're not talkin' books.'

25:57.375 --> 26:01.208
We're talking living,
breathing history.

26:01.291 --> 26:03.917
Something that matters.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.583
We live in one of the most
historic cities in the
country.

26:08.667 --> 26:12.250
(McKinney)
Everywhere you go,
the past lives.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.083
You just gotta find it.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.458
'This is your assignment.'

26:17.542 --> 26:19.125
'I want you to go back
to your neighborhood'

26:19.208 --> 26:22.208
and find something
of
historical
significance.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.792
'No matter how small,
and write about it.'

26:24.875 --> 26:26.917
'Get to know where you're from.'

26:27.000 --> 26:29.166
And then you can decide
where you're going.

26:40.417 --> 26:43.083
Now that's a touchin' story.
I'm sure it made you

26:43.166 --> 26:44.583
turn over a new leaf.

26:44.667 --> 26:47.208
- Graduate with honors.
- Don't think I could have?

26:47.291 --> 26:49.125
Where were you
the night Laura was killed?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.625
At work, flippin' burgers.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.166
Answered pretty quick.
Gonna hold up when we check?

26:53.250 --> 26:54.834
What's it matter? Huh?

26:54.917 --> 26:57.083
You already made up
your mind about me.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.917
Set us straight.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.333
You should be looking
at the teacher's pet.

27:02.417 --> 27:03.667
That Darnell Brent.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.375
For real. You
should
have seen the way

27:05.458 --> 27:06.625
that kid was looking at her.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.291
Left her little stuffed animals.

27:08.375 --> 27:12.834
Gifts, right. Put 'em
there
anonymous. Real romantic.

27:12.917 --> 27:14.542
We're supposed to believe you

27:14.625 --> 27:17.083
'cause couldn't even
graduate high school.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.750
Now I don't give a damn.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.542
Can I go?

27:26.917 --> 27:28.041
We'll get you a toothbrush.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.667
You're gonna be here a while.

27:31.834 --> 27:33.709
(Miller)
'Little confused here,
Darnell.'

27:33.792 --> 27:36.208
You're the one who
brought this case
in.

27:36.291 --> 27:37.583
Figured you wanted it closed.

27:37.667 --> 27:38.709
Of course I do.

27:38.792 --> 27:41.917
You and Miss
McKinney...
pretty tight?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.709
But it was more than
teacher student.

27:44.792 --> 27:46.083
What do you mean?

27:46.166 --> 27:47.875
You had feelings for her, right?

27:47.959 --> 27:50.250
Leavin' all those
stuffed
animals for her on the
sly.

27:50.333 --> 27:53.709
Staying after
school,
just you and her.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.208
Maybe...messages get mixed.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.750
Wasn't that much older.

28:01.834 --> 28:03.458
Happens to the best of us.

28:06.166 --> 28:09.500
I was 15. Thought I was in love.

28:12.166 --> 28:14.208
(McKinney)
That's terrific, Darnell.

28:14.291 --> 28:16.083
Now this is a thesis statement.

28:16.166 --> 28:17.625
Do you see the difference?

28:19.291 --> 28:20.792
Darnell, what are you doing?

28:25.583 --> 28:29.458
She told me not
to worry about it, but..

28:29.542 --> 28:32.542
...she made sure we were never
alone in the same room again.

28:32.625 --> 28:35.333
- Must have been humiliating.
- Yeah.

28:35.417 --> 28:37.625
But I'm a teacher now.

28:37.709 --> 28:40.291
And I understand her dilemma.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.542
You wanna get close
to your students.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.959
- But not too close.
- Yeah.

28:45.041 --> 28:46.500
This is kidnappin', you know.

28:46.583 --> 28:47.792
Sorry you see it
that way, ma'am.

28:47.875 --> 28:50.417
Lurin' me out of
my own church on bingo day?

28:50.500 --> 28:53.166
- Should be ashamed, young man.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.875
(Jeffries)
'Why don't you step
into the kitchen?'

28:54.959 --> 28:59.583
I'll be with you in a
moment,
show you some pictures.

29:00.375 --> 29:01.917
The old rope-a-dope?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.542
Told her I saw someone hit her
car in the church parking lot.

29:04.625 --> 29:05.834
She comes out..

29:05.917 --> 29:07.458
You persuade her to take a ride.

29:07.542 --> 29:10.125
(Mrs. Harris)
'Detective Jeffries?'

29:10.208 --> 29:12.709
Would it kill you
to offer me some refreshment?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.917
Ballistics report on the
0.22
that killed Laura McKinney.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.125
Aah!

29:22.208 --> 29:23.417
This cost me big.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.500
Two tickets to Wicked,
and dinner.

29:26.583 --> 29:28.583
I need you to appreciate that.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.667
You're my hero.

29:30.750 --> 29:33.000
Murder weapon
has a sordid history.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.333
Recovered by police
seven years ago.

29:34.417 --> 29:36.000
Liquor store robbery.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.542
Well, suspect in
possession
said he found the gun.

29:38.625 --> 29:39.834
Alibi'd out for the murder.

29:39.917 --> 29:41.166
I traced the serial number.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.208
The original owner
was a cab driver. Nigerian
guy.

29:44.291 --> 29:46.166
Kid happened to go
to, Reeves High.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.875
In '91.

29:47.959 --> 29:50.333
Kid gets bullied.
Takes Pop's gun to school.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.625
Confiscated by a security guard.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.166
'Guess who.'

29:56.125 --> 29:57.709
(Valens)
'I've met some low IQ
jackasses'

29:57.792 --> 30:00.375
in my career,
but you take the
prize.

30:00.458 --> 30:01.875
How stupid you got to be.

30:01.959 --> 30:04.542
'Take a gun off a kid,
not turn it in?'

30:04.625 --> 30:07.542
Or...was there a reason?

30:14.417 --> 30:19.375
Between you and me,
I heard Laura was a
knockout.

30:19.458 --> 30:22.041
- You have a thing for her?
- It wasn't like that--

30:22.125 --> 30:24.834
Even some students wanted
a piece, but you think

30:24.917 --> 30:28.750
hey, an authority
figure like myself

30:28.834 --> 30:30.417
I got a shot.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.750
And after some liquid
courage,
you make a move.

30:32.834 --> 30:34.166
- She turns you down.
- No way.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.458
We got you at the
crime scene,
Carlton.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.917
We got you with the
gun.
You're done.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.166
Already typed up my report.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.417
I liked those teachers.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.917
Looked after 'em
the best I could.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.166
That's why I kept the gun.

30:45.250 --> 30:47.291
Someone needed it.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.250
Why'd she need it, Carlton?

31:02.875 --> 31:04.333
I didn't ask.

31:05.709 --> 31:07.834
She was a good woman.

31:07.917 --> 31:11.250
If she said she needed the
gun,
she needed it.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.583
I was just trying to help.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.792
That's my job.

31:15.875 --> 31:19.166
It's time to find a
different line of
work.

31:22.417 --> 31:24.208
(Rush)
'Now don't bother standing.'

31:25.542 --> 31:26.792
What are you doing?

31:26.875 --> 31:28.166
Well, seein' if you're packin'.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.458
Or are the new security guards

31:29.542 --> 31:31.000
more accommodating than Carlton?

31:32.375 --> 31:34.291
You have some kind of grudge
against Laura?

31:34.375 --> 31:36.792
Younger, prettier,
better at her job.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.458
That gun had nothing
to do with Laura.

31:38.542 --> 31:39.959
Then what was it for, Margaret?

31:40.041 --> 31:41.166
Protection.

31:41.250 --> 31:45.417
After 20 years in this war
zone,
I got attacked.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.166
Former students.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.333
I could never feel safe again.

31:49.417 --> 31:50.750
So you went to Carlton?

31:52.542 --> 31:54.375
I never felt comfortable
havin' that gun.

31:54.458 --> 31:55.792
'Then one day'

31:55.875 --> 31:58.166
my purse was stolen
from the teachers' lounge.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.083
And this happened
before Laura was killed?

32:01.417 --> 32:03.000
So, why didn't you report it?

32:03.083 --> 32:05.125
Didn't want to get
Carlton into trouble.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.333
He's a good man.

32:06.417 --> 32:10.000
A close friend...at the time.

32:11.291 --> 32:12.875
You meet Will's girlfriend yet?

32:12.959 --> 32:14.834
No, but I heard her
all the way down the hall.

32:14.917 --> 32:17.333
- Delightful woman.
- He get anything from her?

32:17.417 --> 32:20.792
Hope so, or he's about to
pitch
an old lady out the window.

32:20.875 --> 32:22.041
Back in '91, you said

32:22.125 --> 32:24.083
you saw a black man
running from the scene.

32:24.166 --> 32:26.375
This isn't a black man.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.583
Son, you don't think
I know the difference?

32:28.667 --> 32:32.000
I said a dark skinned man
came running past my window.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.166
This is the one I saw.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.417
(Jeffries)
'Renaldo Ramos.'

32:46.291 --> 32:48.583
Hey, look at you, Renaldo.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.792
32, still livin' at home,
no kind of job.

32:51.875 --> 32:53.291
Acting like
you got it figured out.

32:53.375 --> 32:55.542
You say so.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.375
You were there, the night
Miss McKinney was killed.

32:58.458 --> 33:00.125
You were fed up
with the way she treated you.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.083
You stole Margaret's bag
with the gun in it

33:02.166 --> 33:03.375
waited for her, then pop!

33:03.458 --> 33:05.125
- I was at my job.
- There was no job.

33:05.208 --> 33:06.542
I didn't do nothing.

33:06.625 --> 33:09.250
We got the old lady clocking
you
from her window.

33:09.333 --> 33:11.792
Got 30 witnesses sayin'
you bragged on all the things

33:11.875 --> 33:13.875
you stole from
the teachers' lounge.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.458
It's over.

33:16.709 --> 33:18.834
Just too dull to know it.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.917
I couldn't have her mad.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.959
So, you went at her.

33:28.041 --> 33:30.000
No.

33:30.083 --> 33:31.417
She came to me.

33:41.166 --> 33:42.375
Yeah.

33:42.458 --> 33:43.750
What you doing here, miss?

33:43.834 --> 33:45.542
This ain't
a good neighborhood, you
know.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.500
I wanted to see
where the fire was.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.083
What you mean?

33:52.166 --> 33:54.291
Well, it says six tenants
lost their homes to a fire

33:54.375 --> 33:56.875
right here in this building,
ten years ago.

33:57.834 --> 33:58.959
Long time.

33:59.041 --> 34:01.750
One man made sure
they were all relocated.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.458
Took care of them.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.875
Roberto Jimenez.

34:05.959 --> 34:07.333
It's pretty amazing.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.458
I know your handwriting,
Renaldo.

34:13.667 --> 34:15.792
It's the assignment I gave
on the field trip.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.834
He was my grandfather.

34:20.333 --> 34:23.000
It's good...Renaldo.

34:25.208 --> 34:29.959
Like you said,
history's happening everywhere.

34:30.041 --> 34:33.917
Like you comin' to
Reeves,
makin' a difference.

34:39.250 --> 34:40.667
You want back in my class?

34:42.750 --> 34:44.125
You need to use your voice.
If you want in

34:44.208 --> 34:45.667
I have to hear you say it.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.000
Yeah.

34:50.083 --> 34:51.875
That's what I want.

34:54.917 --> 34:56.750
Okay.

34:56.834 --> 34:58.500
But I need you to come clean
about the drugs.

34:58.583 --> 35:00.667
But, miss,
those weren't my
drugs.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.875
- Renaldo..
- I swear to you.

35:06.458 --> 35:08.792
They said I steal. I don't.

35:08.875 --> 35:11.333
They say I deal drugs. I don't.

35:11.417 --> 35:13.458
Everyone's always
sayin'
I'm bad.

35:13.542 --> 35:14.834
I stopped tryin'
to prove 'em
wrong.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.041
There's always
someone else to blame

35:16.125 --> 35:18.500
for your crap life,
your dumb mistakes.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.000
You said tell the
truth.
I told you.

35:20.083 --> 35:21.417
Drugs didn't belong to me.

35:21.500 --> 35:24.291
Then, who, Renaldo,
another student?

35:26.250 --> 35:27.625
A teacher.

35:32.583 --> 35:34.875
(Rush)
'It's gotta be hard leavin'
that
school like you did.'

35:37.458 --> 35:38.875
Fatigue, right?

35:38.959 --> 35:40.709
Well, the place was impossible.

35:40.792 --> 35:42.041
I had to get out.

35:42.125 --> 35:45.583
But you and I both
know
it wasn't fatigue.

35:47.041 --> 35:50.291
Nothing changes
if nothing
changes.

35:50.375 --> 35:54.208
I can spot another
addict
a mile away.

35:54.291 --> 35:56.250
(Rush)
'Yeah, I, uh,
I had a problem.'

35:56.333 --> 35:58.291
Almost lost my job over it.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.417
It can be rough.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.875
Yeah, still is.

36:02.959 --> 36:04.458
Day at a time, right?

36:06.291 --> 36:10.542
How bad a habit?
A gram? Uh, two?

36:10.625 --> 36:13.375
It gets expensive
on a teacher's
salary.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.041
I kept it together.

36:15.125 --> 36:16.291
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.709
Yeah, me, too.

36:19.125 --> 36:20.583
Until one day I-I woke up

36:20.667 --> 36:23.250
and...saw the mess I made.

36:25.291 --> 36:26.667
The thing is, then we get better

36:26.750 --> 36:28.709
and we gotta
take
responsibility.

36:30.583 --> 36:31.875
Hey, we're, uh..

36:33.667 --> 36:36.917
We're only as
sick
as our secrets.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.917
Like taking Margaret's
bag
from the faculty lounge.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.667
You did that,
but the worst part,
Kenny

36:43.750 --> 36:45.291
and I know you feel this..

36:45.375 --> 36:48.667
...the worst part, is
using
Renaldo to score for
you.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.208
(Valens)
'You told Laura all about
it'

36:52.291 --> 36:53.792
Kenny makin' you score for him?

36:53.875 --> 36:56.834
Should have never
got her involved.

36:56.917 --> 36:58.625
And all these years,
why didn't you say somethin'?

36:58.709 --> 37:01.250
You kiddin'? Take a look.

37:01.333 --> 37:02.625
Who's gonna believe
a thug like me?

37:02.709 --> 37:04.041
I wanna believe you, Renaldo.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.667
Wanna be like Laura,
see something different

37:05.750 --> 37:07.041
than just a thug, but you
gotta
be straight with me.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.542
I told you everything.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.291
Still haven't told me
why you were at the crime
scene.

37:11.375 --> 37:13.417
It's my fault she's dead.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.375
Why? 'Cause somethin' happened?

37:19.125 --> 37:20.959
She went back to the school.

37:21.041 --> 37:22.834
To confront Kenny?

37:25.166 --> 37:27.750
I followed.

37:27.834 --> 37:31.458
Waited outside.

37:31.542 --> 37:33.709
Just wanted to make
sure
she was okay.

37:36.583 --> 37:39.125
Laura knew about
you and Renaldo.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.083
Everything was on the
line.
If she turned you in

37:41.166 --> 37:42.375
your life would be ruined.

37:42.458 --> 37:45.583
She just didn't get it.
This is a disease.

37:48.291 --> 37:51.333
I just wanted her to listen.

37:52.583 --> 37:54.709
You were there that night.

37:54.792 --> 37:56.625
I..

37:56.709 --> 37:58.834
I needed some time
to get my thoughts together

37:58.917 --> 38:01.625
but she wouldn't let up.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.500
You need to resign.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.041
You can do it with dignity.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.959
I-I won't say a word.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.250
But it has to be done

38:21.333 --> 38:22.667
or I'll turn you in.

38:25.959 --> 38:27.250
How long were you sitting
in your classroom

38:27.333 --> 38:28.834
comin' up with that speech?

38:33.959 --> 38:37.083
Laura...I know this is bad.

38:38.458 --> 38:41.959
It's a problem.
But I'm addressing it.

38:42.041 --> 38:44.208
Address it someplace else,
not around these kids.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.709
See, I'm ahead of you on that.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.125
I already have my eye
on a treatment facility.

38:47.208 --> 38:50.500
This, this is done...tonight.
I promise.

38:50.583 --> 38:52.875
Renaldo is trying so
hard
to do things right.

38:52.959 --> 38:56.041
- You are killing him.
- Damn it. Just let me speak.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.500
Will you wipe that smug look
off your face?

39:03.375 --> 39:06.875
I used to be like you. I used
to
feel so good about teachin'.

39:06.959 --> 39:08.417
I believed in the students.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.750
This place beats
the hell out of you.

39:10.834 --> 39:13.667
You'll see.
In five years, you'll be me.

39:16.750 --> 39:19.583
Laura, stop!
Get back here.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.667
I worked there for ten years

39:21.750 --> 39:25.792
and this kid..
Who did she think she was?

39:25.875 --> 39:29.542
- I was a good teacher.
- So was Laura.

39:32.041 --> 39:34.041
Ah, she was special.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.083
[chuckling]
Made me wanna graduate.

39:40.625 --> 39:43.875
Would have been the first...
in my family.

39:50.333 --> 39:53.333
She went there to defend me,
and I let her down.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.959
I couldn't help.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.458
You can now.

40:02.417 --> 40:03.750
Tell me what you saw.

40:05.375 --> 40:07.333
Hey, do it for her.

40:15.125 --> 40:16.375
Miss?

40:17.375 --> 40:18.667
Miss?

43:27.083 --> 43:28.291
