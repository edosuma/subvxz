[indistinct chatter]

01:01.853 --> 01:03.897
[Aunt 1] Yeah, she'd like that, I'm sure.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.107
[Aunt 2] Can you imagine?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.192
[Aunt 1] [sighs] Such a good daughter!

01:07.484 --> 01:10.404
I mean, the poor thing's been taking care
of her for years.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.364
What she sacrificed.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.157
[screams]

01:14.241 --> 01:16.493
[Aunt 2]
At least now she will be free to go back.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.833
[Aunt 1] Can she ever really
perform again? It's been a decade.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.918
Well, what else is she gonna do?

01:25.002 --> 01:28.338
Uh, I don't know.
I don't think she even knows.

<i>Yes, it's me. Hi.</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:37.074
[voicemail beeps]

02:37.574 --> 02:39.284
<i>Anton, Paloma. Hi.</i>

02:39.368 --> 02:41.787
<i>It's Charlotte Willmore.</i>

02:41.870 --> 02:44.206

02:48.001 --> 02:53.048

02:53.131 --> 02:55.300

03:40.762 --> 03:42.347
[music playing]

04:04.161 --> 04:05.162
[Anton] Charlotte.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.604
Paloma and I are so sorry
about your mother.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.360
[Anton] After a five-month search
over three continents,

04:37.444 --> 04:39.154
we are thrilled to bring our

04:39.237 --> 04:44.409
remarkable finalists together
in Shanghai for one last concert.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.995
The Bachoff Academy in Boston,

04:47.704 --> 04:50.707
founded by my grandfather Emil in 1927,

04:50.791 --> 04:53.668
is quite frankly the premiere 
private music facility

04:53.752 --> 04:56.046
for young cellists in the world.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.382
And each year, we teach hundreds
of day students in Massachusetts,

04:59.466 --> 05:02.677
but only a select handful
are given the opportunity

05:02.761 --> 05:06.264
privilege, really,
to reside and study at the Academy,

05:06.348 --> 05:09.434
which is why I'm so excited
that the winner tonight will receive

05:09.518 --> 05:12.729
a four-year live-in scholarship
to Bachoff.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.356
[audience applause]

05:18.193 --> 05:20.237
Now, the fact

05:20.320 --> 05:23.323
that my most prized protégé,

05:23.406 --> 05:27.327
Elizabeth Wells, one of the best
young cellists on the planet,

05:27.953 --> 05:30.872
will be judging tonight's final concert
is testament

05:31.289 --> 05:34.000
to just how talented
these three young ladies are.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.422
Listening to Lizzie play music so...
pure, so perfect

05:39.506 --> 05:42.634
is as close to God as you can get.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.136
Well, it's as close to God
as I want to get for the time being.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.972
-[audience laugh]
-[Anton] Uh...

05:47.055 --> 05:49.766
But Lizzie's not the only surprise we have
for you this evening.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.935
For four glorious years,

05:52.644 --> 05:55.480
I trained Charlotte Willmore at Bachoff.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.649
Charlotte was a rare and gifted talent

05:57.732 --> 06:02.153
poised for the type of greatness
achieved by very few,

06:02.237 --> 06:03.738
but then as all of you know,

06:04.197 --> 06:05.866
Charlotte's beloved mother, Ruth,

06:06.575 --> 06:07.492
got sick.

06:08.910 --> 06:13.373
Charlotte put her career on hold,
and went back home care for her mother.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.792
This is the heart of Charlotte.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.845
[machine whirs]

06:28.555 --> 06:32.309
I was thrilled that Charlotte reached out
to Paloma and myself,

06:32.934 --> 06:34.978
thrilled that after nearly a decade,

06:35.061 --> 06:36.271
she's back in our lives.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.649
Ladies and gentlemen,
our second judge for this evening,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.026
Charlotte Willmore.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.579
[boat horn blares]

06:55.749 --> 06:57.459
[Paloma]
It's baijiu. Chinese vodka.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.377
Two shots will have you
fluent in Mandarin.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.921
[laughs] Charlotte!

07:01.588 --> 07:02.964
Good, I was looking for you.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.884
You must remember these two
grueling taskmasters from the Academy?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.970
Oh, my goodness.
It's so wonderful to see you.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.597
Theis and Geoffrey.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.641
And after all these years! Mm.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.851
Charlotte, there you are!

07:16.102 --> 07:17.103
Would you excuse us?

07:17.854 --> 07:20.440
I want to introduce you,
before we have to go upstairs and start.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.192
She's so excited to meet you.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.280
And here she is, Charlotte, my star.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.240
-Elizabeth--
-Elizabeth Wells.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.450
Of course.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.203
Lizzie, please.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.163
Hey.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.210
Your music, Lizzie,
it's something more than beautiful.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.630
[Anton] I mean, I'm sorry.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.425
Am I the luckiest man in the world?
I don't even drink and I feel giddy drunk.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.011
My two most perfect students together.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.848
Oh, my goodness.
We gotta get this thing started.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.726
[sighs] I'm such a big fan.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.355
I know that sounds ridiculous,
but I've downloaded all of your music

08:00.438 --> 08:03.191
and that <i>New York Times</i> magazine profile
last month of you,

08:03.274 --> 08:05.944
those photos of you were amazing,
and the way--

08:06.486 --> 08:08.530
I was nine when I first saw you perform.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.825
You were 14 and everything I wanted to be.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.243
My idol.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.787
Please don`t be nervous
around me, Charlotte.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.916
I'm just so happy to finally meet you.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.212
[chuckles]

08:24.295 --> 08:25.672
[cello music plays]

08:51.197 --> 08:52.574
Wanna know a secret?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.662
The girl on the left is going to win.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.832
She's brilliant.
Leaves the other two in the dust.

09:03.835 --> 09:07.505
I agree, but that kind of takes
the drama out of it, doesn't it?

09:12.677 --> 09:13.887
You want drama?

09:16.848 --> 09:19.392
Watch that other girl's mother
in the blue dress.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.397
And the guy in the gray slacks.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.816
He's the father of the girl in the middle.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.695
There's something going on between them.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.864
They can't help themselves.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.285
[scoffs]
And right in front of their spouses.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.454
Just watch.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.957
I first noticed during semifinals.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.044
It's kind of hilarious.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.049
And... kind of hot.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.220
Just watch.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.370
Her hand...

10:42.058 --> 10:43.184
[sighs]

10:43.268 --> 10:45.520
I know I shouldn't spy, but...

10:47.605 --> 10:48.731
that...

10:51.067 --> 10:52.861
That gets me wet.

10:52.944 --> 10:53.987
[chuckles]

11:06.166 --> 11:08.835
[boat horn blares in distance]

11:29.189 --> 11:30.940
We've actually met once before.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.735
We have?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.281
It was the day you were leaving Bachoff.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.161
Your mom had just had her stroke,
and you had all your bags packed, and...

11:43.870 --> 11:49.167
I was just entering,
and I was nervous and excited, and...

11:50.168 --> 11:51.044
I saw you.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.757
My hero.

12:14.651 --> 12:15.652
[chuckles]

12:16.069 --> 12:17.570
That was a long time ago.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.243
Do you ever play anymore?

12:25.161 --> 12:27.580
It took me a while after I left Bachoff.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.916
Years to be honest, but now I...

12:30.458 --> 12:31.459
love it.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.670
-Because you're playing for yourself?
-Exactly.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.380
All that time with Anton,

12:36.631 --> 12:37.715
the practice,

12:38.424 --> 12:40.468
the performances,
the pressure to be perfect.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.095
-It was--
-I know.

12:42.845 --> 12:43.680
[chuckles]

12:45.974 --> 12:47.642
Do you ever think about leaving?

12:48.977 --> 12:50.061
Bachoff?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.399
It's my family. I can never.

12:55.942 --> 12:56.818
Never?

12:58.403 --> 12:59.570
No, never.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.450
And, anyway, the work.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.537
This special work.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.290
It's what's expected of us.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.044
I don't miss hearing that.

13:16.796 --> 13:20.341
Well, you'll be happy to know
I'm giving myself a little vacation.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.719
First one in forever. Starting tomorrow.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.053
-Amazing.
-I know.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.724
I know I can actually... sleep in.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.850
[both chuckle]

13:28.933 --> 13:32.687
Not dream about notes or scales,
rest my hands.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.106
Cause a little trouble.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.900
Have more than one drink in an evening.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.528
The baijiu is delicious.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.739
That is what I've heard.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.283
I better catch up.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.960
[woman] Was it something he ate?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.129
I hope it isn't linked
to what's happening down south.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.507
What's happening down south?

14:45.301 --> 14:47.678
Some sort of hemorrhagic fever
near the Hunan border.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.181
Passed in the air.
Real contagion-like stuff.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.229
We were just scouting in Hunan.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.563
Oh, it can't be that.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.898
[scoffs] I sure hope not.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.068
You know how Anton likes to find his
protégés in remote places.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.613
-Hunan, Cambodia--
-Minnesota.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.781

15:07.949 --> 15:09.909
Will you go dancing with me later?

15:13.204 --> 15:14.163
Yes.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.750
Good.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.920
[Paloma] Lizzie, there you are.
Anton is asking for you.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.588
Come.

[indistinct chatter]

15:30.555 --> 15:31.556

15:31.889 --> 15:34.142
Elizabeth. I was just telling
Geoffrey and Theis

15:34.225 --> 15:36.394
that I was hoping
that we could convince you to play

15:36.477 --> 15:39.480
one short piece, please.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.524
[exhales]

15:41.607 --> 15:45.194
Only if you can convince Charlotte
to play second cello with me.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.239
-My goodness. Yes, please.
-No.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.366
-No.
-No. no. no. We must.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.119
No. Lizzie, Lizzie. I couldn't.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.495
[Anton] Perfect. Please.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.372
Please! Yes, make it happen.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.583
-My goodness.
-Cello duet number three?

15:58.666 --> 15:59.876
[Anton] Oh, yes, perfect.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.336
-I know you still know it.
-[Theis] It's a dream come true.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.379
Lizzie...

16:04.380 --> 16:06.090
Lizzie, I'm an amateur now.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.094
You have been and always will be

16:10.178 --> 16:13.347
the person who makes 
my heart skip a beat when you play.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.274

19:38.594 --> 19:40.554
Have you ever been with a woman before?

19:42.306 --> 19:44.684
I've never been with anyone before.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.771
No one? Ever?

19:50.481 --> 19:52.900
My mom got sick, I went home.

19:53.901 --> 19:57.697
So, everything else just got put on hold.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.994
So, I'm your first.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.329

First and best.

I'm traveling out west tomorrow.

Come with me.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.025
Really?

20:36.277 --> 20:37.236
Yeah.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.613
I'm doing it rough and tumble.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.158
Small buses, weird towns.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.827
As far away from first class as I can get.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.456
Unplugged from everything and everyone.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.627
I think we could have fun together.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.338
I think we could, too.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.767
I've never met anyone like you before.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.481
I mean, we're so different.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.400
And yet...

21:17.860 --> 21:19.737
we're more alike than it may seem.

I'll start.

33:13.617 --> 33:14.451
Adams.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.621
Come on, give me a "B."

33:17.704 --> 33:20.081
Concentrate on that instead of the pain.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.877
Beet... Beethoven.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.545

33:36.056 --> 33:37.140
Good.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.815
Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm gonna puke.

[Charlotte] Oh, God!

34:00.247 --> 34:01.122
Are those b...?

34:02.457 --> 34:04.876
Are those bugs? Are those fucking bugs?

34:15.845 --> 34:17.931
Charlotte. Charlotte.

34:18.515 --> 34:20.559
This isn't normal.
This isn't fucking normal!

34:21.268 --> 34:22.185
Oh, God.

34:22.852 --> 34:24.604
What if... What if that guy last night...

34:24.688 --> 34:26.856
What if he had that Ebola thing
they were talking about?

34:26.940 --> 34:29.442
What if he had it, the one from Hunan?

34:29.526 --> 34:30.527
What if I caught it?

34:30.610 --> 34:32.279
-No. You didn't catch that.
-What if I did?

34:32.362 --> 34:34.739
-You didn't!
-What if I did? Look what's happening.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.659
-What if I did?
-You didn't catch it, you didn't.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.286
Oh, God. I'm gonna fucking die.

34:39.369 --> 34:40.996
-No. Hey, hey, hey.
-I'm gonna fucking die.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.664
Lizzie, you have to sit down.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.708
-[cries] I'm sick.
-No, you're dehydrated.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.168
I'm fucking sick.
What if I'm fucking sick?

34:48.336 --> 34:49.588
What if you're sick, too?

34:50.839 --> 34:53.174
They said it was contagious.
What if you have it too?

34:53.258 --> 34:55.010
-I'm not sick.
-Oh, my God. What if you are?

34:55.093 --> 34:56.261
I'm not sick. It'll be okay.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.389
[shouts] It's not something.
It is not gonna be fucking okay!

34:59.472 --> 35:00.390
Stop saying it!

35:06.771 --> 35:07.731
What are you doing?

35:08.106 --> 35:08.940
What are you doing?

35:09.024 --> 35:10.817
-Whoa. Stop!
-There's something inside of me.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.111
No, no. There's nothing inside of you.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.362
Yes, there is. You saw.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.489
-There were fucking maggots in my puke.
-Well, the--

35:16.573 --> 35:18.033
They're fucking inside of me.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.368
They're crawling in my skin,
I can feel them.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.369
No, there's not.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.621
There's nothing inside of you.

35:22.704 --> 35:26.166
I can feel them. They're in my head
and they won't get out.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.084
Make them get out. Make them get out.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.252
[man shouts in Mandarin]

35:29.336 --> 35:31.630
Oh, God!
It's crawling in my skin, I can feel it!

35:32.130 --> 35:35.342
I can feel it.
It's in my head. Make it stop!

35:35.425 --> 35:36.885
Please! It hurts!

35:36.968 --> 35:38.762
-Get out! Get out of my body!
-Lizzie!

35:38.845 --> 35:40.680
[shouts in Mandarin]

35:40.764 --> 35:42.641
You have to make it stop.
I want it to stop!

35:42.724 --> 35:44.809
[shouts in Mandarin]

35:44.893 --> 35:47.562
-What is he saying?
-He says you have to get off.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.607
Get off? We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.901
[shouting in Mandarin]

35:52.984 --> 35:54.486
You can't kick us off this bus.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.406
We need a doctor!
We need a fucking doctor!

35:58.490 --> 36:00.742
You have to help us find a doctor.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.162
My head, it's killing me.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.497
Lizzie, stop!

36:05.580 --> 36:08.833
What are you doing? Stop! No! Stop!

36:32.774 --> 36:35.026
[inaudible dialogue continues]

36:56.297 --> 36:58.425
Look, we'll get help for you
when we reach Tongli.

36:58.508 --> 36:59.592
I need it now.

36:59.676 --> 37:00.719
[speaks in Mandarin]

37:00.802 --> 37:02.470
That way is a small town.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.681
They'll have a pharmacy, a doctor maybe.

37:04.764 --> 37:05.724
Start walking there.

37:05.807 --> 37:06.850
Fuck you!

37:06.933 --> 37:07.934
You okay?

37:08.017 --> 37:09.102
[woman speaks in Mandarin]

37:10.311 --> 37:11.479
Thank you.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.357
Okay. Okay. Are you okay?

37:15.608 --> 37:18.820
Hey! We're in the middle of nowhere.
What are you doing?

37:19.571 --> 37:21.364
[shouts] No! No!

37:22.282 --> 37:24.617
No! Fuck you!

37:26.411 --> 37:28.621
Please come back. Wait!

37:29.372 --> 37:30.874
Wait!

37:47.974 --> 37:49.684
Here we go. Almost there.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.977
Just keep going.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.397
I'm burning up.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.317
[groans] They're fucking inside of me.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.570
Fucking crawling inside of me.
What is happening?

38:01.029 --> 38:03.031
-It's gonna be okay, it's--
-No, it's not.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.657
Ah, God, it's not.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.202
It's not gonna be okay, Charlotte.
You need to leave me.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.288
-I'm not going to leave you, Lizzie.
-No, Charlotte. Listen to me.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.748
Something is wrong.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.833
Something is wrong with me!

38:13.917 --> 38:15.877
Lizzie, I know,
that's why we need to get you help.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.545
No. I'm dying. Don't you understand that?

38:17.629 --> 38:21.341
-No! I don't understand that.
-But I am. I'm dying. [crying]

38:23.885 --> 38:25.386
It's inside of me.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.680
It's fucking inside of me.

38:31.893 --> 38:32.936
[crying]

38:41.569 --> 38:42.695
[gasps]

38:45.740 --> 38:47.075
Charlotte?

38:50.245 --> 38:51.329
Charlotte?

38:52.497 --> 38:53.706
What's happening?

38:58.127 --> 38:59.170
What's happening?

38:59.879 --> 39:00.839
Oh, my God.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.465
Your arm!

39:03.007 --> 39:05.134
[Lizzie]
There's something crawling inside it.

39:06.636 --> 39:07.470
What is it?

39:07.554 --> 39:08.763
I don't know!

39:08.847 --> 39:10.849
-What's happening?
-I don't fucking know!

39:10.932 --> 39:13.560
Look, it's alive. These are fucking alive!

39:13.643 --> 39:14.519
It's bugs!

39:14.602 --> 39:16.312
They're fucking bugs!

39:18.606 --> 39:19.691
What the fuck?

39:19.774 --> 39:20.650
[retches]

39:23.236 --> 39:25.238
What the fuck is inside of you?

39:26.155 --> 39:27.949
-Oh, my God.
-Your hand.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.620
They're in your hand.
You have to get them out, Lizzie.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.455
Lizzie, you have to stop it.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.749
It's inside of you. You have to stop it.

39:36.833 --> 39:40.461
-They're fucking inside of you!
-Oh, my God. Charlotte, help me.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.131
Help me! Help me, Charlotte!

39:43.214 --> 39:44.674
You know what you have to do.

39:54.893 --> 39:55.727
[screams]

40:04.819 --> 40:06.154
You know what you have to do.

40:07.572 --> 40:08.990
[shouting]

40:33.681 --> 40:34.682
Good morning.

40:36.893 --> 40:37.894
[chuckles]

40:38.269 --> 40:39.562
Good morning, you.

40:41.814 --> 40:42.815
[exhales]

40:42.899 --> 40:44.609
Are you as hungover as I am?

40:45.276 --> 40:46.527
Pretty much. Yeah.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.323
I am out of practice
on the binge drinking.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.451
That Chinese vodka is brutal.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.203
Do you want some ibuprofen?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.967
Pharmacy is open for business.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.677
[Lizzie]
What is that? Hair of the dog?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.596
-It's the best cure.
-[chuckles]

41:13.680 --> 41:15.098
We're on vacation, right?

41:32.991 --> 41:34.117
[Charlotte] Oh, God.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.785
-What?
-Nothing.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.788
-What?
-There was a bug.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.666
-I need another ibuprofen.
-Okay.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.893
We have to get her to a hospital now.

42:00.977 --> 42:02.395
Maybe we can call someone.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.564
Shit.

42:05.106 --> 42:06.607
There's no service.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.485
Oh, God. Oh, God, I'm gonna puke.
[vomits]

42:09.902 --> 42:10.862
[retches]

42:10.945 --> 42:11.988
Are those b...?

42:13.531 --> 42:15.908
Are those bugs? Are those fucking bugs?

42:19.620 --> 42:20.580
What's happening?

42:21.330 --> 42:23.666
Oh, my God! Your arm!

42:24.792 --> 42:26.919
There's something crawling inside me.

42:27.503 --> 42:29.005
It's bugs! Bugs!

42:32.091 --> 42:33.426
What the fuck?

42:34.427 --> 42:35.762
They're in your hand.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.305
They're all in your hand!

42:38.431 --> 42:39.849
You know what you have to do.

42:45.855 --> 42:48.399
[Lizzie cries]

42:53.029 --> 42:54.072

42:54.155 --> 42:58.076

43:09.128 --> 43:10.838
[classical music playing]

43:42.370 --> 43:44.622
[Paloma]
I know it's a very long way from China,

43:44.705 --> 43:48.334
but we are so thrilled to have Zhang Li
come live with us and study cello.

43:48.417 --> 43:50.169
The joy is for us, Ms. Paloma.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.839
It's every dream I ever had for her.

43:52.922 --> 43:56.717
We will take the very best care of her,
as if she was our own daughter.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.973
Now, Zhang Li, are you ready to go down
and see the Chapel?

44:02.056 --> 44:02.890
Yes.

44:04.100 --> 44:07.395
[Paloma] The day students you study with
are unlikely to ever see this.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.815
Spectacular, isn't it?

44:12.066 --> 44:14.819
Converted from a chapel
nearly a hundred years ago.

44:15.778 --> 44:18.781
Based on the Musikverein in Vienna.

44:19.615 --> 44:22.285
Zhang Li, come here. Come up here.

44:24.829 --> 44:25.955
Come on. Come.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.916
Okay, now stand right here.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.209
Right here.

44:30.293 --> 44:32.879
And I want you to sing a note.

44:33.254 --> 44:34.964
Hm. A sharp.

44:35.339 --> 44:36.215
Hm.

44:40.052 --> 44:40.887
Sing.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.765
[singing]

44:47.185 --> 44:48.853
Doesn't that sound incredible?

44:50.813 --> 44:53.107
I believe this to be the most...

44:53.774 --> 44:56.402
acoustically perfect room
I've ever been in.

44:56.485 --> 44:58.571
-[Zhang Li] It's beautiful.
-And...

44:58.654 --> 45:00.448
very few students

45:01.115 --> 45:03.075
are invited to play here.

45:03.159 --> 45:07.371
It takes years and years
of intense practice.

45:07.455 --> 45:08.664
But the best,

45:09.332 --> 45:10.541
the very best,

45:10.625 --> 45:12.043
Lizzie, for example,

45:12.501 --> 45:14.754
Charlotte Willmore, before her.

45:16.297 --> 45:18.299
If you are as exceptional

45:18.758 --> 45:22.720
as they are, and Zhang Li,
I believe you may be,

45:22.803 --> 45:26.182
well, then you can have the chance
to perform here

45:26.265 --> 45:28.517
and then you can have the chance...

45:29.852 --> 45:30.978
for greatness.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.295
[doorbell buzzes]

Who is it, please?

46:24.365 --> 46:25.574
[clears throat] Hello.

46:28.953 --> 46:29.787
Who is it?

46:38.629 --> 46:39.505
Oh, my God.

46:40.631 --> 46:41.674
Where have you been?

46:42.675 --> 46:45.386
What's... What's happened to you?
We've been looking for you.

46:47.430 --> 46:48.472
Elizabeth.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.019
What happened to your hand?

46:59.400 --> 47:01.444
[shouts]
What the hell happened to your hand?

47:03.029 --> 47:05.197
They found me on the side of a mountain.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.034
Drugged out of my mind.

47:09.660 --> 47:10.995
Covered in blood.

47:12.997 --> 47:16.167
With nothing but a homemade tourniquet
keeping me alive.

47:18.878 --> 47:20.838
The police tried to help me, but...

47:22.715 --> 47:24.967
I'm the one who took the pills.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.094
I'm the one who...

47:27.803 --> 47:29.388
chopped my own hand off.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.476
Once I woke up in the hospital, and...

47:34.310 --> 47:38.105
once the drugs were out of my system,
and I could think clearly again...

47:40.191 --> 47:42.109
Charlotte was already out of the country.

47:42.193 --> 47:44.070
I still can't understand.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.155
Why? Why would she do this?

47:47.031 --> 47:48.074
Because...

47:49.158 --> 47:51.702
Because she's a jealous fucking bitch!

47:53.412 --> 47:54.413
I had...

47:54.997 --> 47:57.583
music, fame...

47:58.793 --> 47:59.794
you.

48:00.836 --> 48:02.129
And she couldn't stand that.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.673
She couldn't stand
that I replaced her. She...

48:05.174 --> 48:08.427
tracked me down to China, befriended me,

48:08.969 --> 48:11.389
slept with me, poisoned me.

48:11.472 --> 48:15.184
All that because I had the life
that she so desperately wanted.

48:15.267 --> 48:16.852
My God. God.

48:17.770 --> 48:19.730
[cries]
And now it's gone. It is...

48:19.814 --> 48:21.941
It is completely gone.

48:22.817 --> 48:23.943
Elizabeth, it's...

48:24.235 --> 48:25.694
It's going to be okay.

48:25.778 --> 48:27.863
She took everything from me.

48:29.281 --> 48:30.533
Everything!

48:42.795 --> 48:44.547
[clock ticking]

48:46.715 --> 48:47.758
[screams]

48:50.803 --> 48:51.762
[screams]

48:56.809 --> 48:57.810
[sniffles]

49:00.771 --> 49:01.939
[screams]

49:08.904 --> 49:10.656
[cello playing]

49:20.583 --> 49:21.625
[Anton] More tension.

49:22.877 --> 49:23.794
Yes.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.089
Good. Good.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.175
Play through the pain. Good.

49:37.766 --> 49:38.684
Right.

49:39.602 --> 49:40.478
Don't...

49:53.032 --> 49:55.910
Actually, Elizabeth,
when practice is over,

49:55.993 --> 49:57.786
do you have a minute to talk?

50:01.081 --> 50:02.208
[door closes]

50:04.001 --> 50:05.461
I don't understand.

50:07.671 --> 50:08.756
You're kicking me out?

50:10.341 --> 50:11.717
I have nowhere to go.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.177
We found you a place.

50:13.636 --> 50:16.055
By the museum,
right next to Central Avenue T Station.

50:16.138 --> 50:17.139
We'll pay for it.

50:17.223 --> 50:19.391
Pay for all of it.
Pay for your rehabilitation.

50:19.475 --> 50:22.353
But I can still be useful, Anton.
I can teach.

50:23.562 --> 50:25.606
Music is my life.

50:25.689 --> 50:26.690
Look at us.

50:27.566 --> 50:28.776
You know what this is.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.028
How we work here.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.696
We have Theis and Geoffrey.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.698
We don't need any more teachers.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.076
But I can conduct, and I can compose.

50:37.159 --> 50:38.285
Fuck, I'll scrub the toilets!

50:38.369 --> 50:40.454
Just don't... Don't shut me out.

50:42.081 --> 50:43.374
[sobs] Please.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.251
Anton...

50:46.418 --> 50:47.753
if you accept me,

50:47.836 --> 50:49.797
the music world will accept me.

50:50.589 --> 50:52.132
Don't you understand that?

50:52.758 --> 50:54.885
You have that power.

50:54.969 --> 50:56.762
You have that reputation.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.223
Your word means so much,

50:59.932 --> 51:01.642
but if you shut me out...

51:02.268 --> 51:04.228
[sobs] Please.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.314
Please.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.234
Don't be this person.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.028
Do not discard me.

51:13.112 --> 51:16.574
Lizzie, this is a music conservatory,
not a convalescent home.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.287
I'm sorry.

51:22.496 --> 51:23.872
I didn't mean it like that,

51:23.956 --> 51:26.584
but there are other girls
that we need to house and train.

51:30.296 --> 51:31.380
Anton...

51:33.632 --> 51:34.675
Please. [sobs]

51:37.052 --> 51:38.679
I don't know anything else.

51:40.889 --> 51:42.057
You had a gift.

51:44.059 --> 51:45.394
A rare and...

51:46.687 --> 51:49.273
beautiful talent like no other.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.360
But sadly, that gift is gone.

51:56.697 --> 51:58.073
I'm so sorry, Elizabeth.

52:03.495 --> 52:04.580
[softly] Please.

52:07.207 --> 52:09.460
[sighs]

52:25.643 --> 52:26.810
[sobs]

53:20.781 --> 53:21.990
[dog barking in the distance]

53:31.625 --> 53:32.668
[thuds]

53:37.005 --> 53:38.549
[bottle clanking]

53:54.857 --> 53:55.941
[door creaks]

54:07.411 --> 54:08.454
Hello?

54:41.695 --> 54:42.988
[electrical crackling]

54:44.615 --> 54:45.783
[grunts]

54:50.078 --> 54:51.205
[grunts]

54:51.288 --> 54:53.916
Fuck you. Crazy bitch!

54:53.999 --> 54:56.752
Fuck you! Fuck you!

54:56.835 --> 54:59.546
Fuck you. You fucking bitch!

55:08.931 --> 55:10.682
[breathes heavily]

55:13.101 --> 55:14.770
[operatic music playing]

55:31.078 --> 55:32.079
[Paloma] Anton.

55:34.957 --> 55:35.999
What's going on?

55:42.005 --> 55:42.923
Anton.

55:43.006 --> 55:43.966
Stay here.

55:48.554 --> 55:49.471
Lizzie.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.474
What are you doing here?

55:53.058 --> 55:54.726
You're gonna freeze to death.

55:57.604 --> 56:01.441
Look, I know this is hard,
but I thought I made myself clear.

56:01.525 --> 56:02.985
You just can't be here.

56:03.652 --> 56:05.362
Because I had nothing you wanted.

56:06.572 --> 56:07.656
Now I do.

56:08.574 --> 56:09.867
What are you talking about?

56:11.535 --> 56:12.661
What do you have?

56:14.037 --> 56:16.790
I have the bitch.

56:19.334 --> 56:20.502
Oh, my God.

56:22.588 --> 56:24.047
Lizzie, what have you done?

56:25.173 --> 56:26.091
Where is she?

56:28.594 --> 56:29.803
Where is she?

56:32.347 --> 56:34.683
In the trunk of my fucking car.

56:41.523 --> 56:42.733
So I can come home?

56:55.787 --> 56:56.663
Where is she?

56:57.623 --> 57:00.042
She's with Paloma, but don't worry.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.419
She... She can't hurt you.

57:02.502 --> 57:03.837
But she's crazy.

57:04.421 --> 57:06.006
She kidnapped me, Anton.

57:06.089 --> 57:08.050
I know. She's not well. Clearly.

57:09.635 --> 57:10.761
But frankly,

57:11.803 --> 57:12.971
neither are you.

57:15.307 --> 57:17.100
Were you really that jealous?

57:18.226 --> 57:19.478
I wasn't jealous.

57:21.521 --> 57:22.564
I was trying to help her.

57:24.316 --> 57:25.734
By cutting off her hand?

57:29.321 --> 57:31.531
I saw her picture in a magazine.

57:32.074 --> 57:33.700
I saw the tattoo on her back.

57:34.826 --> 57:35.911
The same as mine.

57:38.372 --> 57:39.623
I knew how she got it.

57:41.083 --> 57:44.044
I knew what she had to do to get it.

57:45.504 --> 57:47.965
And I knew she was brainwashed
just like I was

57:48.048 --> 57:50.926
until my mom got sick
and I had to go home.

57:52.844 --> 57:56.556
<i>I sat in that room with my mother</i>
<i>for a decade, slowly going crazy.</i>

57:57.015 --> 57:59.142
<i>I blamed myself for everything.</i>

57:59.226 --> 58:03.730
<i>I spent years in and out of</i>
<i>mental hospitals until, finally,</i>

58:03.814 --> 58:05.899
<i>with some help, I saw the light.</i>

58:07.484 --> 58:09.528
So I reached out...

58:11.196 --> 58:12.823
and came back into your lives.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.744
Came back why?

58:21.415 --> 58:23.041
Came back why, Charlotte?

58:23.125 --> 58:24.751
To help save her.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.753
Save her from what?

58:29.047 --> 58:30.048
From you.

58:33.635 --> 58:34.928
[stammers]

58:38.974 --> 58:40.434
[stammers and laughs]

58:44.062 --> 58:45.439
[laughs]

58:54.740 --> 58:56.283
[sighs deeply]

59:03.999 --> 59:05.709
[cello playing]

59:07.836 --> 59:09.046
[Anton] Very good.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.091
Very good.

59:14.426 --> 59:15.677
Back straight now.

59:17.804 --> 59:18.805
Excellent.

59:20.182 --> 59:21.767
More tension in the strings.

59:24.061 --> 59:26.271
Feel it happening inside of you,
Charlotte.

59:28.482 --> 59:29.441
Mm-hmm.

59:29.816 --> 59:30.776
Yes.

59:31.777 --> 59:32.694
Good.

59:43.288 --> 59:44.498
I made a mistake.

59:44.581 --> 59:45.582
Yes, you did.

59:47.459 --> 59:48.835
I'm sorry.

59:48.919 --> 59:50.420
And after all this time.

59:50.504 --> 59:52.172
-Forgive me.
-After all this training.

59:52.255 --> 59:53.465
Forgive me, Anton.

59:53.548 --> 59:55.926
After a promise for Carnegie Hall.

59:59.596 --> 1:00:01.890
[groans] Stop. Stop the crying.

1:00:02.390 --> 1:00:04.351
[sobs]

1:00:04.434 --> 1:00:05.644
Ouch.

1:00:06.311 --> 1:00:08.355
[yells] Stop the fucking crying!

1:00:08.814 --> 1:00:10.148
It won't happen again.

1:00:10.232 --> 1:00:12.275
In this room, it had better not.

1:00:12.359 --> 1:00:13.485
Never in this room.

1:00:13.568 --> 1:00:15.070
Because you know what happens next.

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:16.780
-Yes, I do.
-Do you?

1:00:17.155 --> 1:00:18.115
Yes.

1:00:18.198 --> 1:00:19.950
[footsteps approach]

1:00:22.911 --> 1:00:24.788
We don't make mistakes here.

1:00:27.124 --> 1:00:29.209
Not when we represent the Academy.

1:00:39.219 --> 1:00:40.679
Whose name is on that gate?

1:00:41.721 --> 1:00:43.765
-Yours.
-Yes.

1:00:44.432 --> 1:00:47.227
Mine, my father's, grandfather's.

1:00:47.894 --> 1:00:49.187
This school is my blood.

1:00:49.729 --> 1:00:50.856
It's my history.

1:00:51.898 --> 1:00:55.485
I teach you the way they taught me,
the way they taught Theis and Geoffrey,

1:00:55.569 --> 1:00:59.614
and anyone who's fortunate enough
to earn their place here.

1:01:00.365 --> 1:01:01.741
But I can only take you so far.

1:01:01.825 --> 1:01:02.951
I will work harder.

1:01:03.034 --> 1:01:05.996
Oh, you will work harder.

1:01:07.372 --> 1:01:09.499
Why do we work so hard, Charlotte?

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:11.626
To be the best.

1:01:11.710 --> 1:01:13.253
And why is that, Charlotte?

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:18.008
Because it's what's expected of us.

1:01:24.806 --> 1:01:27.100
You got that tattoo because

1:01:27.184 --> 1:01:31.813
you were ready to play in this Chapel.

1:01:31.897 --> 1:01:34.274
You got that tattoo...

1:01:35.025 --> 1:01:36.651
because you were the very best.

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:38.486
Yes, I know.

1:01:38.570 --> 1:01:40.197
And If you're not the very best,

1:01:40.989 --> 1:01:42.324
if you insult me...

1:01:42.949 --> 1:01:45.744
and Theis and Geoffrey with your mistakes?

1:01:46.578 --> 1:01:48.246
I discredit the Academy.

1:01:49.915 --> 1:01:50.832
Why?

1:01:52.334 --> 1:01:56.087
Because I was prepared for
The Perfection and failed.

1:01:57.214 --> 1:02:02.344
Prepared by our sweat,
passion, and reputation.

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:06.139
Prepared by our sweat and passion
and reputation.

1:02:06.223 --> 1:02:08.350
Month after month, year after year.

1:02:10.644 --> 1:02:12.896
Month after month, year after year.

1:02:12.979 --> 1:02:14.522
[Anton]
Until you were ready.

1:02:17.150 --> 1:02:18.276
Until I was ready.

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:41.675
[Anton] You failed.

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:43.468
You failed.

1:02:47.055 --> 1:02:48.431
So what does that mean?

1:02:49.975 --> 1:02:51.685
What does that mean, Charlotte?

1:02:52.852 --> 1:02:55.855
When you fail
at the things that we teach you?

1:02:57.524 --> 1:02:59.025
I cannot get close to God.

1:02:59.109 --> 1:03:01.027
No, you cannot.

1:03:01.486 --> 1:03:03.488
And your talent will lay in waste.

1:03:03.989 --> 1:03:06.408
Squandered by your lack of ambition.

1:03:07.450 --> 1:03:08.743
So what happens now?

1:03:09.369 --> 1:03:11.288
-Now?
-Yes, what happens now?

1:03:11.371 --> 1:03:14.165
What happened to me,
what happened to Theis and Geoffrey?

1:03:14.249 --> 1:03:18.128
And every one of the chosen who failed?

1:03:22.882 --> 1:03:24.217
We pay the price.

1:03:32.475 --> 1:03:33.852
You pay the price.

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:37.147
[muffled screaming]

1:03:38.606 --> 1:03:39.941
[sobbing]

1:03:42.110 --> 1:03:43.653
[grunting]

1:03:58.501 --> 1:03:59.544
[Anton grunts]

1:04:00.462 --> 1:04:01.504
[grunts]

1:04:03.757 --> 1:04:04.716
[grunts]

1:04:42.754 --> 1:04:46.049
Tonight, Charlotte, after so many years,

1:04:46.508 --> 1:04:48.593
you shall play for us again.

1:04:50.887 --> 1:04:51.888
I can't.

1:04:53.348 --> 1:04:56.017
-I'm not ready.
-Sonata for solo cello.

1:04:56.101 --> 1:04:58.228
I'm not ready to play here, Anton.

1:04:58.812 --> 1:04:59.979
Please.

1:05:00.063 --> 1:05:03.650
Well, here is where you must play.
Where you've always played.

1:05:04.567 --> 1:05:06.069
Theis, Geoffrey.

1:05:06.152 --> 1:05:06.986
No.

1:05:14.744 --> 1:05:16.371
And, of course, Paloma.

1:05:19.457 --> 1:05:20.291
Please.

1:05:20.708 --> 1:05:23.211
Paloma, you can stop this.

1:05:23.962 --> 1:05:24.963
Please.

1:05:25.547 --> 1:05:27.340
We do what we need to do, Charlotte.

1:05:28.508 --> 1:05:30.009
It's what's expected of us.

1:05:32.846 --> 1:05:36.015
Paloma's always adored
when you played perfectly. Well..

1:05:36.433 --> 1:05:37.475
we all did.

1:05:38.101 --> 1:05:40.019
That was always the goal.

1:05:40.103 --> 1:05:41.104
Right, Charlotte?

1:05:42.355 --> 1:05:43.481
The Perfection.

1:05:44.524 --> 1:05:47.652
This doesn't have to be like this, Anton.

1:05:51.698 --> 1:05:53.450
You really hate me, don't you?

1:05:54.909 --> 1:05:55.827
You...

1:05:55.910 --> 1:06:00.039
you hate me,
when all I ever did was believe in you.

1:06:00.123 --> 1:06:02.542
You know what you did to me.

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:05.003
And you know it helped you become
