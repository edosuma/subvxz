WEBVTT

00:09.759 --> 00:10.802
[Olivia] Look at him.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.513
Completely in control.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.767
Like he's enjoying it,
little piece of shit.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.562
Nothing scares that kid.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.021
He's the most dangerous.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.565
What happened to the fourth one?

00:23.648 --> 00:25.316
His parents got him on a plane

00:25.400 --> 00:28.862
for a supposed exchange program,
at a boarding school in the U.S.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.780
Perfect timing, so to speak.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.074
We can still request
extradition.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.576
Take it easy, Carla.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.078
It's possible,
but we have a lot here.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.997
[Elisa] Leave this kid to me.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.832
The smug ones are my specialty.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.125
[Olivia] All yours.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.295
[theme music plays]

01:32.467 --> 01:34.511
THE PACK

01:48.399 --> 01:50.068
[phone rings]

01:51.361 --> 01:52.821
-Hello?
-[distorted voice] <i>A bitch in</i>
<i>heat</i>

01:52.904 --> 01:54.948
<i>can mate with up to ten dogs</i>
<i>in one day?</i>

01:55.031 --> 01:56.407
Who are you, motherfucker?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.243
<i>Nature doesn't lie.</i>

01:58.326 --> 02:01.079
Give me your name, motherfucker.
Fucking coward!

02:01.162 --> 02:02.455
-<i>Blanca.</i>
-I'm going to find you!

02:02.539 --> 02:04.374
-I'll kill you!
-Mom, hand it over!

02:04.457 --> 02:05.959
You don't know
who you're talking to!

02:06.042 --> 02:07.085
Hand it over!

02:08.253 --> 02:10.004
You know nothing about my
sister.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.548
<i>That bitch isn't your sister.</i>

02:11.631 --> 02:13.967
-What did you say?
-Give it to me.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.010
-Listen to me.
-[line disconnects]

02:19.138 --> 02:21.015
[phone beeps]

02:21.099 --> 02:23.143
He told me Blanca
wasn't my sister.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.020
Why would he say that?

02:28.439 --> 02:29.858
Because he's a psycho.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.820
[door bell chimes]

02:33.903 --> 02:35.071
I'll go.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.910
-What happened?
-They were caught.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.537
-Who?
-The rugby players.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.872
-Where are they?
-The police station.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.123
Let's go.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.129
[all chanting]
<i>We want justice! Justice!</i>
<i>Justice!</i>

02:51.212 --> 02:54.674
<i>We want justice! Justice!</i>
<i>Justice!</i>

02:54.757 --> 02:56.301
<i>We want justice!</i>

02:56.384 --> 02:58.177
I just want to clear up
this misunderstanding

02:58.261 --> 03:00.054
as soon as possible.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.264
Misunderstanding?

03:02.473 --> 03:06.686
You are accusing four innocent
people of rape and kidnapping.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.522
Your son and his friends
are in the video, ma'am.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.773
Of course, I'm not denying it.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.276
We were in that video,

03:13.359 --> 03:14.944
but things aren't what they
seem.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.905
-There is a mistake here.
-A mistake?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.824
What mistake?
I saw you in the video.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.577
I'm telling you we had
group sex with Blanca

03:22.660 --> 03:23.870
because she asked to.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.914
And we filmed it
because she asked to.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.125
Where is Blanca?

03:29.208 --> 03:31.044
What kind of a question is that?

03:31.127 --> 03:34.213
You're assuming that my son
has her hidden in my house.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.258
I haven't said that,
Madam Attorney.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.844
I'm going to repeat
the question for your son.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.096
What did you do with her
after you had sex?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.307
-[mother] Consensual sex.
-We went partying.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.351
-She didn't want to come.
-Why not?

03:46.434 --> 03:48.645
I don't know,
you'd have to ask her.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.480
But surely, she felt...

03:50.563 --> 03:51.773
you know...

03:51.856 --> 03:53.024
satisfied.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.859
And you left her
alone at the warehouse.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.153
Of course not.
We left her near the school.

03:57.236 --> 03:58.571
Are there any witnesses?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.615
She asked us to leave her
two blocks away.

04:00.698 --> 04:01.950
She didn't want to be seen
with us.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.077
-Why not?
-Why do you think?

04:04.160 --> 04:07.330
A feminist leader
having sex with four men?

04:07.413 --> 04:09.332
Let's just say
it wouldn't look so good.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.170
You mean to tell me
she agreed to all this?

04:15.463 --> 04:19.759
-The ski masks, the video...
-I'm sorry you're so
closed-minded

04:19.842 --> 04:21.594
that you can't help
but judge a girl

04:21.678 --> 04:24.305
that just wants to have sex
with four rugby players.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.434
Do you think I'm dumb, kiddo?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.478
Maybe just a little
old-fashioned.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.480
Women like Blanca learn about
sex

04:32.563 --> 04:34.065
watching videos on the Internet.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.359
When they grow up,
they want to feel like porn
stars.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.735
There's nothing wrong with that.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.780
Actually, it's widely tolerated.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.657
You don't believe me?

04:42.740 --> 04:46.369
Look up the most viewed porn
video
in the country right now.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.162
-Which?
-Blanca Ibarra.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.332
If a supposed rape
is seen by thousands of people,

04:51.416 --> 04:52.667
there must be a reason.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.419
Some people like it.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.255
Blanca liked it a lot.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.965
Hmm.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.511
When I find her, I'll ask her
whether she liked it or not.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.263
And what you did to her.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.433
-They can't stay in custody.
-I think they can.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.684
You know why?

05:09.767 --> 05:12.645
Because none of these kids
has told us the actual story.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.273
We set them free, they'll hit us
with an appeal tomorrow,

05:15.356 --> 05:17.275
and I want to find Blanca,
alive.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.028
I want the same thing.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.614
-But...
-Goddammit, Jorquera!

05:23.698 --> 05:25.199
I know this is all bullshit!

05:27.243 --> 05:29.829
Do you know who
little Eduardo's father is?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.622
Or whose son this little shit
is?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.875
I don't even remember his name.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.753
The one they rushed out
on a private jet?

05:36.836 --> 05:39.380
-Filthy rich people?
-I wish it were just that.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.882
They're powerful people.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.091
With friends.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.511
They're our bosses' friends,
the people who employ us.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.929
Just understand me.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.890
I have to follow certain rules.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.892
Chief...

05:50.975 --> 05:54.228
Please back me up.
I'm asking as a special favor.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.730
Hear me out.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.692
I'm positive that I can get
Benjamín to confess.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.902
He wanted to talk.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.196
It was only when he saw
the lawyer and his friends--

06:03.279 --> 06:05.490
I can't do it, I'm sorry.

06:06.908 --> 06:10.244
The DNA samples you got
don't match any of them.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.206
Where is Blanca then?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.375
Hiding, I would imagine.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.877
Filled with shame.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.129
After seeing how a drunken
evening

06:20.213 --> 06:22.298
with four morons
got out of control.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.092
You know that's not the case.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.886
Maybe.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.680
Maybe.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.807
But you know what?

06:30.890 --> 06:34.477
My intuition isn't enough
to arrest three minors.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.479
Bring me conclusive evidence,

06:36.562 --> 06:39.398
and I'll incarcerate
those little shits.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.193
Meanwhile...

06:42.276 --> 06:45.404
every minute that those kids
are in custody

06:45.488 --> 06:47.448
is a day less at my job.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.659
Hey, hey!
I'm your ally, goddammit!

06:50.910 --> 06:52.537
I'm your ally.

06:56.707 --> 06:57.875
Release them.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.173
-Carvajal!
-Good morning, Commissioner.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.467
Where are
the detainee's belongings?

07:07.426 --> 07:09.137
I can't give them to you,
Commissioner.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.516
Thank you.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.365
Ten minutes to copy
all the information.

07:29.448 --> 07:30.449
Ten minutes.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.535
This one will take me
a bit longer, though.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.036
Surprise me, Javi.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.417
The guys and I got together

07:39.500 --> 07:41.210
to go have some pre-club drinks.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.753
Who are the guys?

07:42.837 --> 07:47.175
Augusto, Víctor and I...
and Benjamín.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.135
We were going to meet him
on the hill,

07:49.218 --> 07:51.846
and when we got there,
we saw the truck,

07:51.929 --> 07:53.598
so we approached it

07:53.681 --> 07:55.850
and we realized
he was with Blanca.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.019
How did you know
your friend would be there?

07:58.686 --> 08:01.189
Because everyone goes to the
hill.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.983
It's where everyone
goes to drink before going out.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.903
So...it's always full of people.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.531
Some people go to smoke,
some go to drink,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.700
and others go to...

08:13.868 --> 08:14.952
To what?

08:16.370 --> 08:17.580
Geez.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.249
To have sex.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.377
Alright, stop. I'm lost.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.630
You're telling me
you and your friends knew

08:25.713 --> 08:27.256
your friend would be
with his girlfriend,

08:27.340 --> 08:28.424
and you still went?

08:29.759 --> 08:32.386
Excuse me, can we turn on
the AC? It's hot.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.638
No, it's being fixed.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.307
But I don't think the heat
will affect our athlete here.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.391
Will it?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.061
What position do you play?

08:40.978 --> 08:42.647
I don't think
you'll know my position.

08:43.940 --> 08:44.982
Why not?

08:46.692 --> 08:47.860
Try me.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.947
Second row?

08:53.407 --> 08:55.743
-Right lock?
-How did you know?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.287
I had a boyfriend
who played rugby.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.456
So I can recognize
a second row player.

09:00.539 --> 09:01.832
They like to jump.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.543
That's how I tackled you,
remember?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.711
But you know
what that says about you?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.171
No, I have no idea.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.674
That you're someone
who trusts in his team.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.511
Who's the hooker?

09:14.345 --> 09:15.388
Augusto.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.977
And if he plays in the middle,
he had to be fast, smart.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.188
He has to cover
all the blind spots, right?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.857
And you have to do what he says.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.235
On the field I do, sure.
He is the captain.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.861
How about off the field?

09:30.945 --> 09:32.280
No? Really?

09:32.363 --> 09:35.825
I thought everything you learned
on the field applied to life.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.119
At least that's
what my ex told me.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.830
-How'd you get that?
-Training.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.332
We're training a lot,
qualifying rounds are coming.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.500
May I?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.253
What is she doing?

09:47.336 --> 09:49.088
Does she have the right
to do this?

09:49.171 --> 09:52.550
I'm just making sure
that Eduardo's injury

09:52.633 --> 09:54.051
isn't more serious than he
thinks,

09:54.135 --> 09:55.720
so he can make the final.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.264
Father Belmar already saw it
and said it wasn't a problem,

09:58.347 --> 09:59.807
that it's not so serious.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.601
It won't affect you at all,
because it's not a rugby injury.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.855
-I got this while training.
-That is not a rugby injury.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.565
-It's a defensive wound.
-That's enough, let's go.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.900
Did Blanca hit you a lot?
Did she scream?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.360
-Look me in the eye!
-Did she scream?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.279
Let's go! Eduardo, please!

10:17.533 --> 10:19.952
All right, time's up.
Hand it over.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.079
It was broken,
the memory was almost intact.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.873
I was able to recover
almost everything.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.333
Tick-tock, Javi. I have no time.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.667
-Let me finish.
-OK.

10:35.801 --> 10:36.886
Good day.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.513
We're here for these young men's
belongings.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.390
Sure, give me a second.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.314
Where are their phones?

10:48.397 --> 10:49.774
One moment. They're over here.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.777
Here are your things,
please take them immediately.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.866
Your clients
can't leave the country

10:58.949 --> 11:00.076
under any circumstance.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.536
Excuse me, but these young men
haven't been proven guilty,

11:02.620 --> 11:04.246
so they can do as they wish.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.915
Sir, it's very important
that you understand--

11:05.998 --> 11:07.291
General Valenzuela.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.710
Thank you
for clarifying your rank,

11:09.794 --> 11:11.921
but I'm addressing you
as Eduardo Valenzuela's father,

11:12.004 --> 11:13.172
not as a retired General.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.007
Miss, do you think
those are separate?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.717
If you attack my family, my
honor,

11:16.801 --> 11:17.968
you attack my institution.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.720
Commissioner Fernández.
Not "miss."

11:19.804 --> 11:21.847
And I won't tolerate threats
regardless of who you are.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.058
You want to talk about threats,
let's talk about threats.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.060
Nobody's threatening you,
don't worry.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.063
I'll tell you how your
institution
has behaved with these kids.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.773
No one is leaving the country.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.400
We have nothing to fear.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.568
Thank you very much. Shall we?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.237
If we compare the institutions,

11:36.320 --> 11:38.531
I can tell you
which is the most important.

11:38.614 --> 11:39.990
Bye, thank you.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.992
[girls chanting]
<i>Justice, we want justice!</i>

11:42.076 --> 11:44.120
[reporter]
What of the accusations?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.038
We did nothing to Blanca Ibarra.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.540
We are victims
of this whole thing, too.

11:47.623 --> 11:48.791
[reporter] So you didn't rape
her?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.709
<i>We want justice!</i>

11:50.793 --> 11:52.461
They treated us like criminals!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.171
They beat us up!

11:54.255 --> 11:56.549
[mother]
What's wrong with these girls?

11:56.632 --> 11:57.967
Go home, all of you!

11:59.635 --> 12:00.803
I demand privacy!

12:00.886 --> 12:04.473
We'll prove them innocent,
because they are innocent.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.310
This is your fault and these
hysterical screaming girls.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.146
The responsibility is on them
and their parents.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.274
<i>Justice! We want justice!</i>

12:15.818 --> 12:17.862
[clamoring]

12:23.075 --> 12:25.077
<i>We want justice!</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:26.370
Alright, alright.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.252
Thank you, thank you.
You're the best.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.503
Cheers.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.505
Welcome to chaos.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.549
-OK, OK. Hey, don't be like
that.
-[laughter]

12:38.632 --> 12:39.967
[Javi] Did you see the movie?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.761
[Gonzalo] Yeah, the one where
they kill the crow guy.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.180
Yeah, I saw it.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.349
-What?
-[Javi] Can I have some juice?

12:47.433 --> 12:49.643
Why are you
looking at me like that?

12:49.727 --> 12:51.520
-Why?
-[Olivia] You're mean.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.522
[fighting grunts]

12:56.150 --> 12:57.610
[Dani] Hey, I want to play.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.488
-Wait a bit, I'm playing now.
-No, I'm not waiting.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.655
I want to play!

13:01.739 --> 13:04.241
-No, you're not letting me play.
-No, I want to play.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.243
OK, be quiet. Amparo is
sleeping.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.454
OK, she's sleeping.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.040
We'll be working
for a while. Play nice.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.333
OK, alright.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.501
OK.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.796
What are you doing? Hey! What?
No!

13:18.964 --> 13:21.300
None of these conversations
can be used as evidence.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.928
It's critical
that no one hears about this.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.554
[Carla] Yes, of course.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.722
Alright.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.557
[Javi] Victor was the first
to start playing.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.351
We hacked his personal computer.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.895
He found the Wolf Game
on this website.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.527
VICTOR, DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY A GAME? YES

13:39.610 --> 13:41.570
He got the others into the game.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.364
CONGRATULATIONS, PACK,
YOU'RE READY FOR THE NEXT LEVEL.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.033
The Wolf would send messages
to the group.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.785
He left the night Blanca
disappeared.

13:47.868 --> 13:51.497
NOW CHOOSE YOUR PREY, A WOMAN
THAT YOU FOUR WILL DISCIPLINE.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.375
Fuck, and what about Jime?
Jime is so pretty.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.545
[Javi]<i> Then he provided them</i>
<i>with old Android phones.</i>

13:57.628 --> 14:00.756
<i>They were cracked, so</i>
<i>untraceable.</i>

14:00.839 --> 14:02.550
SEND PHOTOS OF YOUR PREY
IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS TO ADVANCE.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.676
FIRST TO DO SO WILL BE LEADER.

14:03.759 --> 14:04.885
Late 90s technology.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.971
It's actually what
drug dealers use.

14:07.054 --> 14:10.057
They're dumb phones
with volatile information.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.393
Benjamín: I don't like this
game,
I'm out.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.852
Victor: Shut up and play, man.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.312
Augusto: How do we choose her?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.191
THE STRONGEST. THE LEADER.
THE INDOMITABLE.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.442
Blanca, bro.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.823
Augusto: This is the prey.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.241
[Olivia]
If these kids were following

14:27.324 --> 14:29.618
someone's orders or
instructions,

14:29.702 --> 14:31.912
whoever designed this game

14:31.996 --> 14:34.164
also designed
a way to recruit them,

14:34.248 --> 14:37.084
grab them, feed them.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.964
BENJAMÍN WILL SEDUCE
AND MARK HER.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.216
Motherfucker, why me?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.385
-He has to seduce her.
-Take it easy.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.637
-I'll do it, bro.
-Enough.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.936
Right this way.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.232
BENJAMÍN WILL DELIVER HER
TO THE PACK.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.529
TWO DAYS FOR THE PHOTO
OF THE MARK.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.535
[Olivia] We know that
Benjamín...

15:12.620 --> 15:14.663
was the first to falter.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.914
Right?

15:15.998 --> 15:18.334
For a while,
he took longer to reply.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.210
<i>He had to be pressured.</i>

15:23.255 --> 15:24.882
Hey, look at Benjamín.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.342
Look, man!

15:27.760 --> 15:29.345
Victor: Great job.
Benjamín: Now what?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.055
[Olivia] Then that chat proves

15:31.138 --> 15:33.891
the mark Blanca had on her neck
was made by Benjamín.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.392
YOU'RE READY FOR THE NEXT TEST.
SHOW HER THAT FEMALES

15:35.476 --> 15:36.769
ARE BENEATH MALES
AND MUST RECEIVE THEM.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.732
Victor: What?
Augusto: He means fuck her.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.360
Victor: Nice.
Eduardo: Gang-bang style.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.527
Benjamín: No.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.404
Augusto: Come on, Benja,
we're already in it...

15:47.488 --> 15:49.615
He was afraid and scared.

15:50.741 --> 15:56.080
So Eduardo, Victor and Augusto
were pressuring him.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.707
IF YOU LEAVE, YOU'LL BE EXPOSED.
Augusto: How so?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.085
OTHER PACKS WILL DAMAGE
THE FAMILIES OF COWARDS.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.546
We're almost there, OK?

16:05.756 --> 16:06.882
Where?

16:06.965 --> 16:10.094
Augusto: Where are you?
Benjamín: The lookout.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.098
Are you going to make that now?

16:14.181 --> 16:15.891
That's what the Wolf
recommended.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.811
[Augusto]
"Not one woman less." Ha!

16:18.894 --> 16:20.771
Idiot, do you think
our protest is a joke?

16:20.854 --> 16:23.148
-Relax, it's a show of support.
-So fucking serious!

16:25.150 --> 16:28.737
He also leaves the group
the day after Blanca disappears.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.949
The pack has to stay united
no matter what!

16:32.032 --> 16:33.826
-Blanca!
-Benjamín!

16:35.619 --> 16:37.037
[Blanca] Stop it, asshole!

16:40.499 --> 16:43.544
[Carla] After the disappearance,
everything starts to crumble.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.754
Víctor got scared too.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.340
He might have told his parents
what happened.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.509
His parents very sweetly
send him abroad that same night.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.553
We're left
with Augusto and Eduardo.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.556
The main instigators.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.142
The toughest ones.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.936
They didn't talk.
It'll be hard to make them.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.488
Let her walk, Gonza.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.409
Thanks for everything, Javi,
you outdid yourself.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.786
No reason to thank me, plus...

17:18.495 --> 17:19.830
I had a great time.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.250
You had fun looking at those
assholes' messages?

17:23.333 --> 17:24.960
No, I mean...

17:25.043 --> 17:26.670
having dinner with you,

17:26.754 --> 17:28.047
meeting your son.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.049
Actually I'd like to do it
again sometime.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.388
-It's OK if you don't want to.
-No.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.556
I mean...

17:37.639 --> 17:39.475
One of these days
when we have time.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.726
I don't really know when.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.770
-Whenever you want.
-What's going on there?

17:43.687 --> 17:45.355
Better not ask.

17:46.815 --> 17:47.941
See you.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.903
-Bye, Javi.
-Bye!

17:54.156 --> 17:55.407
What?

18:17.262 --> 18:18.388
Manuel.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.975
What are you doing here?

18:22.810 --> 18:24.311
How are you feeling?

18:24.853 --> 18:27.439
Like I just got the crap
beaten out of me.

18:28.524 --> 18:32.110
Olivia asked me to be here
as soon as you woke up.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.530
Thank you.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.282
I'm not as well
as I'd like to be, but...

18:38.617 --> 18:40.118
that's nothing new.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.829
It's neither the first
nor the last time.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.330
Really?

18:45.499 --> 18:48.126
In many countries,
working with teenagers

18:48.210 --> 18:49.920
is more dangerous
than being in the police.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.634
Did you see any of their faces?

18:55.717 --> 18:58.720
Or hear anything they said?

19:00.514 --> 19:03.183
Yelling, taunting...

19:03.267 --> 19:05.853
They talked to me
as if they knew me.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.731
If you ask me,
it was the rugby players.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.067
Impossible.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.612
At 4:00 p.m. they were
in custody at the station.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.575
Did they confess?

19:20.284 --> 19:21.493
Was it them?

19:21.577 --> 19:23.996
No, we had to let them go.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.084
Do you want me to call someone?
A loved one?

19:30.794 --> 19:33.255
The closest person would be
my building's doorman.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.299
I mean someone...

19:35.382 --> 19:37.509
in another country,
something like that.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.387
Nobody's waiting for me
anywhere.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.975
I haven't been to Mexico
in four years, I don't call...

19:46.101 --> 19:47.394
There's nobody.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.785
What's up?

20:04.661 --> 20:06.121
Why are you so quiet?

20:10.250 --> 20:11.960
There's nothing we can do,
Celeste.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.005
These fuckers' families
are protecting them.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.132
Yeah, Celeste. They're not
alone.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.967
Plus, the cops aren't with us.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.303
Are you scared?

20:34.775 --> 20:36.109
I can't be scared.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.278
I need to find my sister.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.238
But how?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.698
That's my problem.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.579
Celeste... hold on!

20:50.249 --> 20:52.000
Hey, we're not your enemies.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.503
I know. Go with them.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.546
You promised me
you'd take care of yourself.

20:57.714 --> 21:00.300
Didn't you promise you'd talk
to the women at the PDI?

21:00.384 --> 21:02.844
And that's what I'm doing,
I'm protected.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.809
-Nothing will happen to me.
-Promise me.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.769
-I promise
-Promise me.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.187
I promise.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.079
Manuel!

21:31.456 --> 21:32.916
I'm sorry.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.961
Olivia asked them to let us know
when you were discharged.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.879
With all this attention,

21:37.963 --> 21:39.840
I'm going to start
feeling special.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.801
And I'm also your Uber driver.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.845
-No, no.
-Yes, yes.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.347
Really, I can't ask that of you.
I'll just go.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.933
You're not asking, Olivia is.
So please...

21:57.983 --> 21:59.276
How old were you

21:59.359 --> 22:01.194
when you started
Ossandón's workshop?

22:03.113 --> 22:04.865
-Fourteen.
-And when he started

22:04.948 --> 22:06.199
to cross the line with you?

22:06.283 --> 22:07.993
He was different
from other teachers.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.954
I trusted him.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.789
I even told him
when I lost my virginity,

22:12.873 --> 22:13.915
before my friends.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.876
He made you believe
he was your friend.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.836
Or that he was in love with you.

22:18.378 --> 22:23.133
When I was sixteen,
I was sure I was in love.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.511
I was sure I was the one
who had pursued him.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.929
That I had done everything.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.015
But when I got pregnant
everything changed.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.600
He showed his true colors.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.851
And what was he like?

22:32.934 --> 22:34.686
He was full of rage.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.896
He told me I was just a kid

22:35.979 --> 22:37.814
and didn't know what I was
doing.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.736
Sure, but when we slept
together,

22:42.819 --> 22:44.029
I was a woman.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.947
And then, I was a little girl.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.075
He talked to my parents,

22:48.158 --> 22:51.495
and said I made
the whole thing up.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.997
That it was a lie,
that that child wasn't his.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.501
That if we wanted,
he could help us fix it.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.710
And what happened to your child?

22:58.794 --> 23:01.755
A girl. She didn't even take
her first breath.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.176
She was stillborn. [sobs]

23:07.511 --> 23:09.971
OK, calm down. OK, Luz.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.267
I'd like to ask her just
a couple more questions.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.062
Please.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.483
My daughter took years to
recover

23:21.566 --> 23:23.276
from what happened to her.

23:23.360 --> 23:28.406
Therapy, medicine, hospitals.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.992
We don't need you
to come open old wounds.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.963
[starts engine]

24:30.927 --> 24:32.220
Nice view.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.684
Today's view. Tomorrow, who
knows.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.524
Do you need help
with anything else before I...

24:44.608 --> 24:46.067
The pills that are in my coat.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.903
In the coat...

24:54.117 --> 24:56.453
There's two of them. Which one?

24:56.536 --> 24:57.621
The green ones.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.165
Thanks.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.708
I'll go get you some water.

25:10.508 --> 25:12.344
-There you are.
-Thank you.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.764
-Do you have to leave?
-Yes.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.269
Do you need anything else?

25:21.353 --> 25:23.605
-Thanks so much for everything.
-No, don't worry.

25:24.564 --> 25:27.025
I mean, anything you need,
you can call me.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.987
I'll get the door for myself,

25:31.071 --> 25:33.448
you don't need to go, excuse me.

25:33.531 --> 25:34.991
-Get some rest.
-Thank you.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.618
Bye.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.194
-[Bruno] Thank you for coming.
-[Olivia] Good evening.

26:12.862 --> 26:16.992
I want to cooperate,
but I want to ask you a favor.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.245
For all of this to happen
after Blanca is found.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.455
I don't want to put my wife

26:22.539 --> 26:25.208
through questioning
or journalists.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.419
She couldn't handle it, please.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.712
Not now.

26:28.795 --> 26:33.717
I'd like for the investigation
to focus on what really matters.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.636
Not to turn into a witch hunt.

26:37.971 --> 26:41.391
What really matters to me
is finding your daughter, Bruno.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.103
Blanca is not my daughter.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.356
She isn't my biological
daughter.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.192
Nor is she Maria's,
but she has no idea.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.821
How can she not know?

26:54.904 --> 26:56.489
Who's the mother, then?

26:56.573 --> 26:57.782
She doesn't exist.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.493
The records disappeared years
ago.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.873
Are we talking about
an illegal adoption?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.960
I'm talking about us
having made a mistake,

27:09.044 --> 27:10.503
a big mistake,

27:10.587 --> 27:12.756
and I'm willing to deal
with the consequences.

27:19.888 --> 27:23.391
We will proceed to draw blood
for the corresponding DNA sample

27:23.475 --> 27:24.976
according to protocol.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.031
[whispers] Hi, little bean.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.627
[whispers]
My precious little bean.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.506
What time is it?

27:54.589 --> 27:55.799
Late.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.426
Thank you.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.098
How were they?

28:03.973 --> 28:05.266
Fine.

28:07.685 --> 28:10.772
She wanted to watch these
YouTubers that scared even me.

28:36.631 --> 28:37.966
Why did you call me?

28:39.050 --> 28:42.011
-Come in.
-I won't go into your house.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.222
If you have something to tell
me,
tell me here and now.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.932
I want you to believe me,
at least.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.476
I could never do anything
to Blanca.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.438
I've known her since
she was little--

28:51.521 --> 28:54.274
I don't want you to talk
about my daughter!

28:54.357 --> 28:55.942
I don't want you to say her
name!

28:56.025 --> 28:58.653
I want to know where she is
and what happened!

28:58.736 --> 29:00.989
So tell me what you have to say
and that's it!

29:01.072 --> 29:02.365
I'm not interested in
apologies--

29:02.449 --> 29:03.992
Before you hear it
from someone else,

29:04.075 --> 29:06.578
you should know Blanca was here
before disappearing.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.829
My daughter was here?

29:08.997 --> 29:10.915
Yes, I tried to help her.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.877
-What did you do to my daughter?
-Nothing.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.714
So you thought she was
a very special woman.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.799
A little girl
that you wanted to help?

29:19.883 --> 29:21.217
Like her classmate,

29:21.301 --> 29:23.511
who you helped so much
that she got pregnant?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.638
You're screwed. You know why?

29:25.722 --> 29:27.098
Because you're an abuser.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.602
And you know
what'll happen to you?

29:30.685 --> 29:32.729
You'll die in jail.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.606
You know my life is over, right?

29:34.689 --> 29:35.899
Yes.

29:35.982 --> 29:38.818
You're going to rot in jail.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.033
Talk to Bruno.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.078
He's the only one

29:49.162 --> 29:51.289
who can tell you
what happened to your daughter.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.344
Commissioner Fernández is here.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.471
She says she's here
to see Benjamín Lira.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.641
Do you have a court order?

30:09.724 --> 30:12.560
No, I'll request one now.
They'll send me it in a moment.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.479
Yes, she says they'll send it.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.220
[Olivia] Can we talk?

30:47.303 --> 30:49.430
[Benjamín] They told me
not to talk to anyone.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.062
Do you feel any better?

30:57.689 --> 30:58.773
No.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.195
Maybe talking to me
will make you feel better.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.201
We know it was a test.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.704
Blanca's rape,

31:12.787 --> 31:15.290
we know it was a test
in the Wolf Game.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.584
Benjamín,
you can still help Blanca.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.211
I know you care.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.255
I know you're a good person.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.592
Blanca is still alive,
but we don't know for how long.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.513
Relax, take a deep breath.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.974
Close your mouth,
breathe through your nose.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.602
Benjamín, try to remember.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.147
-What is it?
-I remember...

31:39.897 --> 31:43.860
we left her in...
the factory warehouse and...

31:47.071 --> 31:49.198
-And--
-Were others in the warehouse?

31:49.282 --> 31:52.076
-I don't know...
-Who else was there?

31:52.160 --> 31:54.245
They said that was the last
test.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.830
-They told us...
-Who told you?

31:56.748 --> 31:57.832
The Wolf.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.168
Who's The Wolf?
Did you see his face?

32:01.502 --> 32:03.004
Did you hear his voice?

32:04.213 --> 32:06.841
They sent us
a text message, that's all.

32:06.924 --> 32:09.469
I never saw his face,
I don't know who he is.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.512
-What might he want?
-[woman] Alfredo, here she is!

32:11.596 --> 32:13.848
[Benjamín]
I don't know, but nothing good.

32:13.931 --> 32:16.184
-[Olivia] Who cut the cameras?
-[woman] You need an order!

32:16.267 --> 32:17.935
[Olivia] Yes, I'm leaving now.
Was it you guys?

32:18.019 --> 32:19.562
-[Alfredo] Ma'am!
-Who shut off the cameras?

32:19.646 --> 32:21.272
[Alfredo] Lady, this way please.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.024
-[Olivia] Benjamín?
-[Alfredo] Please.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.405
GONZALO, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE NEXT LEVEL?

33:26.671 --> 33:27.630
New?

33:27.714 --> 33:29.257
Yes.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.678
-Koke.
-Gonzalo.

33:35.471 --> 33:38.474
-You shouldn't be in uniform.
-Why not?

33:38.558 --> 33:40.518
Because they'll know who you
are,

33:40.601 --> 33:42.353
and a pack has to be invisible.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.945
I guess you weren't
as dumb as I thought.

33:51.028 --> 33:53.156
-You know each other?
-I've seen him at school.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.867
Gringo.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.076
Box.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.204
Box, I like it.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.165
He's Gonzalo. I'm Koke.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.374
Koke?

34:03.458 --> 34:04.584
-Gringo.
-Gonzalo.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.877
Should we send the pictures,

34:05.960 --> 34:07.295
set up the group
and start playing?

34:07.378 --> 34:08.504
-Alright.
-OK.

34:15.428 --> 34:18.056
MALE NATURE IS VIOLENT,
TERRITORIAL, AND DOMINANT.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.725
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE READY
FOR THE NEXT LEVEL.

34:20.808 --> 34:23.728
NOW CHOOSE YOUR PREY
AND CUT A PIECE OF HER HAIR.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.716
[Petersen] <i>This game is already</i>
<i>live on the web...</i>

34:54.759 --> 34:56.803
<i>recruiting followers.</i>

34:56.886 --> 34:59.222
It doesn't have to brainwash
them,

34:59.305 --> 35:01.891
It just has to know
their weaknesses,

35:01.974 --> 35:05.186
their weak spots,
resentments, angers.

35:06.896 --> 35:10.733
But how could all men be capable
of raping and killing women?

35:13.486 --> 35:17.156
How is there not a single one
who gets cold feet

35:17.240 --> 35:19.450
and doesn't go to the next
level?

35:19.534 --> 35:20.743
There might be.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.164
But most of them will keep
raping young women like Blanca.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.892
I'm going to ask you,
very seriously.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.106
No more lies.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.650
What are you talking about?

35:54.777 --> 35:57.071
I want you to tell me
the truth about Blanca.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.284
Blanca will come back,
I'm sure of it.

36:02.076 --> 36:03.286
Tell me the truth.

36:30.271 --> 36:33.190
Our baby died at birth.

36:37.486 --> 36:41.282
They took you into surgery,
you were losing blood.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.912
There wasn't a lot of time
to do anything.

36:53.669 --> 36:57.214
And I started wandering
around the hospital.

36:59.175 --> 37:02.136
I knew very well
what the news would do to you.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.724
After trying for a child
for so long...

37:07.683 --> 37:08.851
it would have killed you.

37:14.315 --> 37:17.401
Then this little girl showed
up...

37:18.527 --> 37:19.612
healthy...

37:19.695 --> 37:20.988
newborn...

37:22.406 --> 37:23.616
that no one wanted.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.328
Our Blanca.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.207
Where did you get her?

37:31.999 --> 37:34.001
Belmar helped me.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.879
Actually, he offered her to me.
I couldn't refuse.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.804
Who's the mother?

37:47.974 --> 37:52.687
How does Belmar
get his hands on a baby?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.397
Explain, Bruno.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.648
I don't know.

38:01.487 --> 38:04.323
We have to call the police
and accuse Belmar.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.327
But why? No.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.624
He's involved in Blanca's
disappearance.

38:14.834 --> 38:18.295
Why would he do something
like that after all this time?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.298
To erase evidence.

38:22.633 --> 38:26.887
There's a video of young men
with ski masks.

38:30.224 --> 38:31.892
They're his students.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.730
He trains them.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.403
They do as he asks.

39:22.485 --> 39:26.280
Please, I need your help.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.866
There's no trace.
He knows how to hide.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.618
Don't contact me again.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.912
Tanaka left the conversation.
Tanaka blocked you.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.505
Http://thewolfgame666.onion

39:45.049 --> 39:46.801
My phone was stolen.
I'd already marked someone.

39:46.884 --> 39:47.968
Can I continue?

39:55.267 --> 39:56.977
MALE NATURE IS VIOLENT,
TERRITORIAL, AND DOMINANT.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.104
ARE YOU READY
FOR THE NEXT LEVEL?

39:58.187 --> 39:59.355
YES

40:01.607 --> 40:04.151
BE THERE IN ONE HOUR
OR YOU'LL BE ELIMINATED.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.835
She looks identical.

40:21.752 --> 40:22.795
You're so good.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.798
Blanca will be very proud of
you.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.761
She'll turn up.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.556
-Alright?
-Alright.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.641
-She'll turn up.
-She will.

40:35.724 --> 40:38.144
Do you guys really think
Blanca will turn up?

40:38.227 --> 40:39.478
-Yes.
-Yes.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.402
What I do know is
that Celeste's looking for her.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.655
And when that girl's on a
mission,

40:49.738 --> 40:51.782
-she doesn't stop.
-She won't stop.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.742
-She's stubborn.
-She's brave.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.496
At least we're leaving something
so people will remember.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.665
What the fuck
is that asshole doing here?

40:59.748 --> 41:01.125
Are you kidding me?

41:04.086 --> 41:06.297
Get out of here, old pervert!

41:06.380 --> 41:09.466
Hey, Ossandón, go home! Holy
shit!

41:09.550 --> 41:11.135
Careful, careful!

41:12.970 --> 41:15.764
-Calm down, please.
-Sofia, come.

41:19.518 --> 41:20.811
-Come.
-OK, dude!

41:20.895 --> 41:22.521
I need to talk to you. Come
here.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.398
-No, no.
-Sofia, no. Don't go.

41:24.481 --> 41:25.733
Sofia!

41:28.652 --> 41:30.070
Get in the car.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.990
-Sofia, no! Don't go!
-Son of a bitch!

41:39.997 --> 41:42.374
-Sofia!
-Help, help!

42:08.984 --> 42:10.986
IF YOU TALK OR DROP OUT,
BLANCA WILL DIE.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.374
WELCOME TO THE WOLF GAME,
CELESTE.

42:23.457 --> 42:25.501
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST WOMAN
TO PLAY.

42:34.426 --> 42:35.970
[Ossandón] Are you afraid?

42:40.057 --> 42:41.850
You have no reason to be scared.

42:42.726 --> 42:45.562
I'm not a monster.
I'm not a criminal.

42:45.646 --> 42:48.524
You're here because I want you
to understand what you've done.

42:49.608 --> 42:52.361
Do you understand
how badly you fucked up?

42:52.444 --> 42:55.739
Do you or don't you understand
how badly you fucked up?

42:55.823 --> 42:57.825
[whimpering]

42:57.908 --> 42:59.576
How would a couple of brats
like you understand?

42:59.660 --> 43:02.913
The only thing you know how to
do
is look at yourselves.

43:05.165 --> 43:07.251
Do you know that
you fucked my life up?

43:07.334 --> 43:10.004
My wife doesn't want me to see
my little girl anymore.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.508
My little girl.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.927
She needs me.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.184
You used to be different, Luz.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.312
We loved each other...

43:26.395 --> 43:28.022
and I loved you.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.231
You understood things

43:29.315 --> 43:31.108
that other girls your age
didn't.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.277
Did I force you to do anything?
Yes or no?

43:33.360 --> 43:35.446
-No.
-So then why the fuck?

43:35.529 --> 43:37.448
Why the fuck?

43:39.950 --> 43:41.493
You took everything
out of context,

43:41.577 --> 43:43.746
so things look disgusting,

43:43.829 --> 43:45.706
as if I were a sick person.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.046
You're a son of a bitch.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.714
You used to be different, too.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.342
-Go fuck yourself!
-You used to be shy.

43:56.425 --> 43:57.509
Fuck you!

43:57.593 --> 43:59.261
I don't care that you have a
gun!

43:59.345 --> 44:01.013
You're still going
to kill us both, fucker!

44:01.096 --> 44:02.765
No! No! I'm done!

44:02.848 --> 44:05.643
I'm tired of being afraid!
I'm tired!

44:08.062 --> 44:10.773
Are you going to tell me
it's normal, you fucker?

44:10.856 --> 44:13.442
That I stopped getting my
period.

44:13.525 --> 44:16.570
Or that I puked every day,
son of a bitch?

44:19.907 --> 44:22.034
Or that I would feel guilty...

44:22.910 --> 44:25.120
for getting turned on?

44:27.373 --> 44:29.166
For being confused?

44:35.422 --> 44:38.384
Don't you know what you did to
us?

44:38.467 --> 44:41.011
You should be thanking me
for stopping you.

44:41.095 --> 44:44.556
Otherwise you would've ended up
molesting your own daughter,
too.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.442

45:10.499 --> 45:12.459
