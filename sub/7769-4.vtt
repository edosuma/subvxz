You're a Mason?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Sic transit gloria mundi!

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
I love you, more than
anyone I've ever known.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Well, that's enough for me.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Yes, but I'm not in a position
to promise you anything.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Father, I'm afraid I'm going
to need some more money.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.490
- How much?
- 43,000.

00:18.491 --> 00:19.720
What?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Natasha, this is
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
May I request the pleasure of a
dance with your daughter Natalia?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Of course.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Go to her, don't let her
get away! Propose to her.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Why doesn't he come?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It's been three weeks.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.969
Did he say he would?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
No...

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
but he loves me, I am sure of it.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Did he say so?

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Not in so many words. But how
could he look at me as he did

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
and not mean it?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.619
And you?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Do you love him?

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I do. I think I've loved him

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
since the first time I
saw him at Otradnoe.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
It's not like it was with
Boris, or anyone. It's...

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
It's so deep, it frightens me.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
So it must be true love, mustn't it?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I suppose it must, my dear.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.686
Well then, why doesn't he come?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't know, my darling.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
If it's meant to happen,
it will happen.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
There's nothing we can do about it.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Go to bed, and see what
the morning will bring.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
- I can't, Mama.
- No more talk.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Bed.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Firstly, this marriage would
not be ideal in terms of family,

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
wealth and distinction.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
The Rostovs are a perfectly
good family, Father.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
That may be, but you could do better
in that respect, and you know it.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Secondly, you are not in early youth
and your health is not strong.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
You have never fully recovered from
the wound you took at Austerlitz.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And you're in love
with this girl, you say.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Very deeply, Father.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Hah!

02:58.000 --> 03:02.553
Triumph of hope over
experience. All right.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Will you do this for me?

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Take a year, go abroad, take a
cure, find a tutor for Nikolushka,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
and if, after this year,
your passion for this girl

03:15.000 --> 03:18.813
is still so irresistible,
marry her then.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Can you do this? To please me?

04:12.564 --> 04:15.000
- It's him. What am I going to do?
- Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.

Oh! Prince Andrei, it's a
pleasure to welcome you here.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
It seems so long
since we last saw you.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Countess Rostova, may
I request your permission

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
for a private conversation
with your daughter?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Of course, Prince.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Come with me.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.643
I loved you at the moment I saw you.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
May I hope...

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
... you love me?

Yes, yes! Yes, I love you.

made it a condition of his consent

that the marriage not
take place for a year.

conduct in Switzerland.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh!

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
It cannot be otherwise.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I know a year seems like a long time,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.800
but it will give you the
chance to test your love.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Our engagement will remain a secret.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I consider myself bound,
but you should not.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I want you to feel perfectly
free to change your mind.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.727

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
No...

06:21.000 --> 06:22.638

- No.

Yes, he was.

all about, then?

Well, I'm engaged, that's
all, and I'm very happy.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
He's a wonderful man, Nikki.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Is he? I met him once.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Seemed a bit of a cold fish to me.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh, no, you're wrong,
he isn't! No, he's very...

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
He's intense, and deep.
And he loves you?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.373
Yes, of course, he loves me!

go away for a year?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Why not announce the betrothal?

and I don't want to talk about it

(HE CLICKS HORSE ON)

Nikki, my dear,

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
you must know that things
are very serious with our finances.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
As a woman, your sister has
no claim over Prince Andrei's estate

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
and nothing your father tries
ever seems to work out,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
and he has such a generous nature

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
that everybody takes
advantage of him.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
And you, my dear Nikki...

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
with all that business about the
card game and your friend Dolokhov,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
that was a terrible blow
to the family fortunes.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I know, Mama, and I'm sorry.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I know you're sorry, and I know
you'll be very glad to hear

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
that you have it in your power
to make all things well again.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
How can I do that?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
You remember Julie Karagina?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
- You used to be  playmates together.

lovely young woman.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000

are all sadly... dead...

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
she is an heiress
of a great fortune.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Would you really demand
that I sacrifice my honour

11:09.000 --> 11:11.550
and my feelings for
the sake of money?

11:11.551 --> 11:12.999
No, no, of course not!

11:13.000 --> 11:17.627
You've misunderstood me. Of course,
we wish for your happiness.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
But you could be happy
with Julie Karagina,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
you could manage to
fall in love with her,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
there's nothing
wrong with her at all!

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Really, Mama, I can't
just command my feelings!

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
I do understand, of course I do...
and I hate having to ask this...

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
but our situation is desperate,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.474
and, as our son, you are
the only one who can help.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I'll think about it, Mama.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
That's all I can say.

of working out, my dear.

a great change is coming.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I sometimes wish nothing
would ever change...

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
... it could be just you and
me and Sonya, like this.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Stay like children.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Not possible.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Tonight, it is.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Mother, Father...

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
I have something I want to say to
you before I return to my regiment.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
- (TEACUPS CLATTER)
- I must tell you...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
... that I am in love with Sonya...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
... and I want us to be married.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
I know it's not what you want for
me, but my feelings can't be denied

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and I want Sonya to hear this, too.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I love her.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.585
I've never loved anyone else,
I could never marry anyone else.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And that's all there
is to it. I'm sorry.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Nevertheless, you go
against your parents' wishes.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.347
Well, you are of age, Nikolai,

19:26.571 --> 19:27.999
so you can marry anyone you choose,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
but neither I nor your father
will give you our blessing!

19:30.000 --> 19:32.468
Please, don't let us
quarrel over this, Mama...

19:32.469 --> 19:33.736
Ilya! Speak to him.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
My dear boy, if it weren't
for the circumstances,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
we couldn't wish for a
better match than Sonya.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.482
She's a dear girl and
we're very fond of her...

19:42.483 --> 19:44.999
- What circumstances?
- You know the circumstances very well!

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Our family affairs are in disorder

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
and we've been expecting
you to help put them right!

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
Your conduct so far has had the
opposite effect, as you well know.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Besides, Sonya is your cousin.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
How you could have let
her wheedle her way...

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
My feelings are my own, Mother,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
and I can't go back on my word.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Then you'd better know
that I can never recognise

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
that intriguer as my
daughter! "Intriguer"?!

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
How can you use such a word

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
about a girl who's always
loved you like a daughter?!

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Sonya is not to blame
for this in any way!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Have you no feelings for her at all?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I have nothing else to say to you!

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Mama, I...

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
(SONYA SOBS)

20:27.000 --> 20:28.700
Perhaps I should go after her.

20:28.701 --> 20:31.000
No, no, let me...
I can explain to her.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
It will be all right,
I...I...I know it will.

done for her! (SHE SNIFFLES)

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
She's not ungrateful, Mama,
you know that, really.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
None of this is her fault,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
she didn't know that Nikolai
was going to speak out.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Truly, she's never expected
anything from him.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And now, my son hates me! (SHE SOBS)

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
He doesn't!

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Oh, he doesn't!

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
He wants your blessing.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Listen, if I can get him to promise
he won't do anything in secret.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
He'll go back to his regiment,
and who knows,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
- perhaps his feelings will cool down.
- Oh, now you know so much of love.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
(SHE SOBS AND GASPS)

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Don't let him go with any
bad feeling between you.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Because who knows what may happen.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.086
Nothing I ever think, or do, or say

21:26.261 --> 21:27.999
ever seems to make any difference.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.803
Our family is in ruin!

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I'm the only one who cares.

- I love you, too.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Look after yourself.

That's it! Make haste!

23:05.000 --> 23:07.138
- Is this our house, too?
- Mm-hm,

23:07.163 --> 23:08.999
this is our Moscow house.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It smells funny.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
It just needs airing,
darling, that's all.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.105
I expect your grandpapa will be
redecorating it in cheerful colours.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.999
He certainly will not!
It's perfectly fine as it is.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
We will dine at six.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.076
I am going to my study and will
not to be disturbed until then.

23:24.215 --> 23:26.999
I have much work to do,
important political work of the kind

23:27.000 --> 23:30.357
that women and children
CANNOT BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND!

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Forgive me, Mademoiselle Bourienne.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, dear Prince,
I quite understand...

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Do you? Do you?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, you dear little thing!

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
When I talk of the stupidity of women,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.602
I refer to THAT one, not you.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Really!

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
What?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
How can you take advantage
of his weakness like that?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
You play up to him!

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
You make a fool of him
and yourself and me!

in Moscow by the time we get there?

Has he said anything definite?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
No, not absolutely definite.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.609
Don't get your hopes up too high.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
He'll come when he comes.

Oh!

- Andrei's not coming after all!
- Oh! (COUNT ROSTOV SIGHS)

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
He says his wound has reopened,

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
and his doctors have insisted
he have rest and treatment for it.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
He sends his respects to you,

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000

and his disappointment, et cetera.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
(SHE SOBS)

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
But why couldn't he come
and have his treatment for it here?

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
He has to respect
his doctors' advice, my dear.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
A long journey might have
a very bad effect on his health.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Take heart,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I'm sure you'll see
him before too long.

May I ask,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
how are you enjoying Moscow?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.618
I have seen very little of it, sir.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.576
Then perhaps you will allow me to
show you some of its finer points?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I believe you know
my friend Bezukhov?

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
Bonaparte behaves in Europe
like a pirate on a captured ship.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And his ambition knows no bounds!

It'll come to war again,
mark my words! No, no, Prince.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Our Tsar has the wisdom and
courage to hold him in check.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
But I tell you this...

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
our wars with the French
will be unsuccessful

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
as long as we meddle in Europe.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Let us keep our borders
safe and strong,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
and then we have no need
to fear Bonaparte.

and we'll send him home...

Yes. I suppose he was.

Well, I sometimes think I'd
marry anyone to get away...

I suppose we should, yes...

you have been kept waiting.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
Well enough, thank you.
I grew up here, it's my home.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
There's dancing in the other room.
Come and dance with me.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
- No, I don't think I should.
- Just one dance.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
I think we really should be going.
My wife's not very well, you know?

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Oh, please don't deprive us
of your lovely daughter, Count.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Come and sit with me and watch
the dancing for half an hour.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Well...

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Half an hour?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Very well, why not?

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Wonderful!

46:17.000 --> 46:20.560
I haven't been able to think
of a single thing except for you.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I'm in love with you.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.573
- I've been in complete torment...
- Please! You mustn't say such things.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
I'm engaged... I'm in love with
someone else. What is that to me?

46:37.000 --> 46:40.614
Don't you understand,
I'm madly in love with you?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
You feel something, too. I know it.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Don't leave me. Dance the next.

No...

48:08.000 --> 48:11.262
- No, no, please...
- What can we do?

48:13.000 --> 48:16.429
I can't call on you openly.
Am I never to see you?

48:19.000 --> 48:22.793
I'll get word to you somehow.
We have to be together.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
No...

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
No.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Say yes.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Give me your word!

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
No, no!

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Ah! Well, there you are!

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
I thought I'd lost you.
We really must go.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.622
If you please, miss...

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
... a man asked me to give you this.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, miss.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
ANATOLE: 'Since last evening
my fate is sealed...

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
'to be loved by you, or die.'

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
So, she's the love of your life
and you want to elope with her?

49:39.000 --> 49:40.476
Are you going to tell her about

49:40.501 --> 49:42.000
- the Polish girl?
- Good God, no!

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
Because you're still married
to that one, aren't you?

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
- Who else knows about her?
- No-one. Just you...

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
... and Pierre Bezukhov.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Well. We'd better hope
the little Rostov girl

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
- isn't going to confide in him, then.
- Why would she?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Look here, Dolokhov,
are you going to help me or not?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.558
Did you read it?

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Yes, I couldn't help it.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Sonya, he loves me!

50:17.000 --> 50:18.568
And I... I love him!

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
- But what about Prince Andrei?
- Oh, that's... That's all over.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
- What? You're refusing him?
- I just told you, that's all over!

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
I can't believe it. You've
loved him for a whole year,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
- and then, in three days...
- I know, I know...

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
I know, but I feel as if
I've always loved Anatole.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
I know now that I've never
really loved anybody before,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
not even Andrei.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I have no will when I'm with Anatole,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
it's like I'm his slave,
I'd do anything for him.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Oh, God!

50:45.000 --> 50:47.558
Oh... what am I going to do?

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
Well, I don't understand,
how could you let it go so far?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Sonya, you don't know what it
feels like to be in love like this.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
I do know what it feels
like to be in love, Natasha.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
And SUFFER for it. But...

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
this feels strange and wrong.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
What's stopping this man from
asking for your hand properly?

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
If that's what he wants,
why can't he come to the house?

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Why doesn't he ask
your parents' consent?

51:12.000 --> 51:14.777
What if he just wants to... seduce you?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
How can you say that,
after you've read his letter?

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
He loves me, Sonya!

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
I'd do anything.
I'd... I'd run away with him!

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
- But you'll ruin yourself!
- I don't care if I ruin myself,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
I WANT to ruin myself!

51:29.000 --> 51:30.784
The sooner the better.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And this is... this is none
of your business!

51:34.000 --> 51:35.515
Just leave me alone! Just go!

51:37.000 --> 51:39.006
Well, I won't let it happen.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
I'll tell.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Sonya!

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
- If you do, you're my enemy forever!
- I'm not your enemy.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Don't you see that
what you're doing is wrong?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
You don't understand anything!

51:52.000 --> 51:54.784
Oh, just go! Just... I hate you!

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
(SHE SIGHS)

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Princess Marya, I wasn't expecting...

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
I have been in despair

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
because of the misunderstanding
that happened between us.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
My brother loves you
and I will love you, too.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
I'm so sorry you weren't
properly received the other day.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
And Papa, too, he's not against you,
he's old and crotchety with us all.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Can you forgive us?

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Of course. There's nothing to forgive.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
But...

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
But...

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I have something to ask you.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Will you tell Prince Andrei
when he comes

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
that our engagement is at an end,
and I cannot be his wife?

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Oh, dear, we must have
offended you deeply...

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
No, it's nothing to do
with that, it's... it's me.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I'm the one who's at fault.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I made a mistake.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
But tell him, please, that he is
released from the engagement,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and ask his forgiveness.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I'm sorry, that's all I can say.

to keep a thing like this quiet?

think when he hears about it?

then everyone will know why...
