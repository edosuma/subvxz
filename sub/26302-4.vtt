WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.737
-The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.
-(shouts)

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
-May we rise.
-Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.921
Previously on Empire...

00:20.954 --> 00:22.723
This place is good for me.
I'm here learning

00:22.756 --> 00:24.192
how the street operates.
I'll be unstoppable.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.394
He needs me to cover
the Sub-Saharan desk.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.496
In Lagos.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.165
If you want it, it's yours.
It's a new song.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.001
What you wrote, that's how
it felt. If Hakeem could just

00:34.034 --> 00:36.604
put out his emotions on the page
like you did...

00:36.637 --> 00:39.673
This is gonna be bigger
than Empire. Built by family.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.075
LUCIOUS:
Welcome, everyone,

00:41.109 --> 00:43.277
to the first
Lyon Family Management event.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.012
-Yes!
-We did that.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.547
You must want something.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.881
I think we're
going to be very good friends.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.687
-Damn, it's hot
as what out here.
-Yes.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.356
He should be coming out soon.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.758
Man, if this was two years ago,
we would've had

00:57.791 --> 01:00.461
the velvet rope at Laviticus,
lines all around the back.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.696
What happened
to not looking back, huh?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.598
'Cause it's our boy.
He's coming home.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.966
-He deserves it.
-Yeah, well,

01:05.999 --> 01:07.635
we damn near ran through
all of that money

01:07.668 --> 01:09.937
from the investors
we shucked and jived for.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.039
Look, baby, why don't you just
take care of getting a hit maker

01:12.072 --> 01:15.609
-and let me worry about
raising the capital? I got it.
-(gate buzzes)

01:15.643 --> 01:17.978
-Is that him?
-Yeah, I think that's him.

01:18.011 --> 01:21.149
(sighs) Promise me, Lucious,

01:21.182 --> 01:22.983
promise me you'll keep
that boy out of jail.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.918
You know if he do one small
thing, they'll throw his ass

01:24.952 --> 01:26.787
-back in there--
I need to hear it.
-No, I promise you.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.323
I promise you a Lyon will never
go back behind them walls.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.058
-Ooh, my baby is home.
-Hey, Ma.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.493
-(laughs)
-Thank God.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.228
-Ooh.
-Hey, Pop.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.430
-Son.
-Yes. Come on,
let's get out of here.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.831
-I know you hungry.
-Oh, yeah.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.167
-Boy, what you been doing?
-(Andre laughs)

01:39.200 --> 01:41.269
-(alarm buzzes)
-DIANA: You're back.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.671
Two visits this week.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.140
I would think being CEO
to a Fortune 500's

01:46.174 --> 01:48.676
monument to coonery
would keep you busier.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.811
You know, clearly,

01:50.844 --> 01:53.347
I just couldn't get enough
of your sparkling wit, Diana.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.350
And yet, all you want
to hear about are the Lyons.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.186
Well, you've already
taken their Empire.

01:58.219 --> 02:02.089
What more do you want? Blood?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.625
Did you know that Empire's
founded on a lie?

02:04.658 --> 02:07.495
A number one album is nothing
more than a series of decisions

02:07.528 --> 02:09.263
based on empirical data.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.965
Lucious's instinct?
Cookie's golden ear?

02:11.999 --> 02:14.635
-It's all garbage.
-Oh, please.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.637
Who do you take me for?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.106
Lucious embarrassed your little
ass at your coming out party

02:19.139 --> 02:21.242
when he refused the invitation
to be your puppet.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.946
Ticked you off, didn't it?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.449
Did Lucious remind you of
all the bullies that used to

02:28.482 --> 02:31.219
beat you up before you became
a Silicon Valley star?

02:31.252 --> 02:34.822
Oh, he showed you.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.525
You're the Little Dipper
to his Big Dipper.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.460
And in front
of all those people.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.730
-If you're not gonna help me...
-I'm gonna help you, dear.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.732
When you tell me the truth.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.735
This is about your ego.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.971
I am a little embarrassed
that I didn't anticipate

02:51.004 --> 02:53.574
how troublesome he could be.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.844
I might be inclined to give you
Lucious's Achilles' heel.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.614
But I'm gonna need
something in return first.

03:05.286 --> 03:11.058
Adelaide Shea has created the
most amazing moisturizing cream.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.596
It's rumored to be made
of stem cells and fetal tissue.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.331
Nothing short of miraculous.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.434
You're worried about
crow's feet in lockdown?

03:20.468 --> 03:23.837
A lady must look her best
no matter the circumstances.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.040
Get me what I want...

03:27.074 --> 03:29.577
and I'll get you what you need.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.215
*

03:40.288 --> 03:42.856
Thank God you finally got
the A/C working.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.292
Uh, you're telling me.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.094
Porsha, who are
all these people in my house?

03:47.127 --> 03:49.096
Oh, these are my interns.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.299
Uh, I did
a background check, okay?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.233
His mama go to church
with my cousin.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.469
Me and her, we got, like,
ten mutual friends on Facebook.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.237
Me and Joey,
we got the same weed man.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.139
-Okay...
-Look, ever since Lucious

03:59.172 --> 04:01.074
bitch-slapped Jeff Kingsley,
we've been getting, like,

04:01.108 --> 04:03.043
500 submissions a day.
I needed some help.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.447
Okay, what I need you to do
is get through this stack, okay?

04:06.480 --> 04:09.317
Because if we don't have anybody
to manage, we can't

04:09.350 --> 04:11.385
call ourselves a management
company, now can we?

04:11.419 --> 04:14.888
No. That's why I want
to show you something.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.957
-* Yeah...
-She blowing up.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.158
* It's no surprise...

04:18.191 --> 04:20.160
Yeah, Cardi B-minus. Pass.

04:20.193 --> 04:21.995
What?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.964
She come ready-made; she's got,
like, 2 million followers.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.966
Look, if we sign her,
drop a single or three,

04:25.999 --> 04:28.101
we gonna be on and popping,
get us some momentum going.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.103
So you like taking
shortcuts, huh?

04:30.137 --> 04:31.739
Yeah, well,
why don't you jump back

04:31.772 --> 04:33.941
in that half a cab
you were driving?

04:33.974 --> 04:35.676
Porsha, we are tastemakers.

04:35.709 --> 04:39.313
That means we find talent,
we develop them into greatness

04:39.347 --> 04:41.415
and the followers come. Okay?

04:41.449 --> 04:43.016
DEVON (over phone):
* Going round, been around...

04:43.050 --> 04:45.285
Hey, what's that
playing in the background?

04:45.319 --> 04:46.787
She tagged him.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.522
DEVON:
* I don't want to love you

04:48.556 --> 04:50.324
-* I don't want to, no...
-(chuckles)

04:50.358 --> 04:53.293
Now, see, that? That sound?

04:53.327 --> 04:56.430
That voice? That is talent.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.366
What's his name?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.368
Background dude
is nobody named Devon.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.370
COOKIE:
Well, that's where we come in.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.804
We take background dude

05:03.837 --> 05:05.539
and we put him
in the foreground.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.608
(laughs)
We're gonna make him a star.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.809
Find him.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.278
And get through this.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.813
Y'all better not
have sticky fingers.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.281
I know what's in my house.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.449
Don't nobody want to take
none of your...

05:15.483 --> 05:16.817
COOKIE:
Shut up, Porsha!

05:18.752 --> 05:22.623
So where's Don Lemon Jr.?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.191
I thought I was here
for his welcome back breakfast?

05:24.224 --> 05:26.560
Kai is not back yet.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.962
-Is his flight delayed?
-No. Actually,
I just got off the phone

05:28.996 --> 05:30.464
with his editor. He hasn't
checked in, or something.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.299
But it's fine. He's fine.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.868
He hasn't checked in?
Are they saying he's missing?

05:34.902 --> 05:37.505
No. Missing? Of course not.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.172
They know he's somewhere,

05:39.206 --> 05:42.543
they just don't know exactly
where that somewhere is.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.878
But I'm not tripping,
I'm not freaking out,

05:44.912 --> 05:47.247
so please, don't you, either.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.850
I'm not freaking out,
'cause he's fine.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.586
-Exactly.
-Everything's going to be fine.

05:52.620 --> 05:56.590
Kai is probably perfectly safe,

05:56.624 --> 05:58.426
and you have nothing
to worry about.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.561
I bet he's gonna call you
any second.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.596
Y'all got almond milk?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.432
Uh, yeah.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.100
* Usually, it's cold
in the England *

06:07.134 --> 06:08.569
* So I think I'll fly
somewhere different *

06:08.602 --> 06:10.203
* Usually, I work
on the weekend... *

06:10.237 --> 06:11.905
What's that, a vodka soda?

06:11.939 --> 06:13.774
Can I buy you another?

06:13.807 --> 06:18.178
Uh, it's actually all soda,
no vodka. Thank you.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.883
* One night ting
is not what I came for *

06:22.916 --> 06:24.351
* Now I'm moving through
the race line... *

06:24.384 --> 06:27.354
Cheers.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.723
* Now, clearly you don't
waste time, want mine *

06:29.757 --> 06:31.124
* Not shy, are you?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.461
Excuse me.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.063
* Need a brother
who move confident... *

06:36.096 --> 06:37.865
I wouldn't finish that drink
if I were you.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.467
You just got drugged,
and I don't think

06:39.500 --> 06:41.702
this was the first...

06:41.735 --> 06:43.704
-I just got drugged?
-Yeah.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.106
From my-my soda?
(chuckles)

06:46.139 --> 06:48.576
-You're cute, thank you.
-No, no, seriously. Okay.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.978
Down there?
Fleet Street paparazzi.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.448
* Honestly, I know that
we just met, but I think... *

06:54.482 --> 06:56.450
So what, you're here to save me,
or something? You...

06:56.484 --> 06:59.653
my knight in a golden...

06:59.687 --> 07:01.288
-Oh, no, no. Okay.
-...muscle shirt?

07:01.321 --> 07:03.991
Come on, man.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.293
What are you a, you a tourist,
or something?

07:06.326 --> 07:07.728
-You're not British.
-I'm American.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.396
(echoing):
I'm just based here.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.264
(camera clicking)

07:11.298 --> 07:13.100
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.168
All right, all right,
come on, come on.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.470
(echoing):
Whoa, now.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.306
Let's go, let's go.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.512
LUCIOUS:
You know what? I'm done talking.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.146
MAN (over phone): Lucious,
I'm gonna get your money.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.248
-You got 24 hours.
-Wait, Lucious...

07:28.281 --> 07:29.950
(phone beeps)

07:29.983 --> 07:31.351
Hey, Pop.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.686
I've been going over
the numbers.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.755
Even with Thirsty's investment,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.657
LFM is gonna need
a quick cash infusion.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.659
Tell me something I don't know.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.060
Is that the book?

07:44.498 --> 07:47.134
What do you know about my book?

07:47.167 --> 07:51.038
I used to sneak in here
and look at it when I was a kid.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.542
It's full of amounts,
dates, uh, nicknames.

07:54.575 --> 07:59.446
Boston Red, Roughhouse,
Silky Slim.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.949
I'd wish I could be in those
streets with you,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.718
doing what you did.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.688
What I did?

08:07.721 --> 08:11.491
Never thought the day would come
when I would have to

08:11.525 --> 08:14.327
be making runs again,
but here it is.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.630
-(gun clicks)
-Desperate times, huh?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.365
That's where you're going?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.838
I see that look
in your eye, Dre.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.374
It's not happening.

08:27.407 --> 08:31.645
Reacclimation is overrated, Pop.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.346
I said I got this.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.349
I never remember you going
to collect without backup, Pop.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.653
Let me roll with you.
I can handle myself.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.255
Nobody's saying you can't.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.592
But you ain't coming with me.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.563
GISELLE:
I will continue here

08:49.597 --> 08:51.899
at Empire as COO,
if you still want me.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.201
Your job was to help me
with the transition,

08:54.234 --> 08:56.937
and I've made
the transition, so...

08:56.970 --> 08:58.171
(whirring)

08:58.205 --> 09:00.207
Please. You need me.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.409
Look, you don't know as much
about this business

09:02.442 --> 09:05.278
or the music community
as you think you do.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.080
I see all your blind spots,

09:07.114 --> 09:09.416
and I'll make sure
that no one else does.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.885
You know the music business.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.921
But I don't think
you can work under me.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.122
I don't think you're over it.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.957
Over what?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.626
Little nerdy boys' club?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.130
Over the job, over us.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.365
(laughs softly)

09:25.398 --> 09:27.234
There never was an "us."

09:27.267 --> 09:29.469
-Come on. There was an "us."
-I'll accept

09:29.502 --> 09:32.405
that we both played
a little game and you won.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.541
Bravo.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.978
But from here on out, we're
gonna be professional, okay?

09:38.011 --> 09:41.915
Otherwise, I'm going to #MeToo

09:41.949 --> 09:44.818
all over your ass.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.054
(Kingsley grunts)

09:47.087 --> 09:49.256
(strained):
All right, welcome back.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.664
(exhales)

09:56.697 --> 09:58.732
PORSHA:
Why you walking so fast?

09:58.766 --> 10:01.134
You think my cousin's gonna
want to buy one of them cars?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.003
COOKIE: Girl, ain't nobody
thinking about your damn cousin.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.005
I mean, his 'gram
lists this as his job.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.141
-You think that's him?
-I hope not.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.344
Listen here. Luther Vandross
did not look like Denzel.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.580
Okay? We are here for the voice.
Get it together.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.816
Hello, how you doing?

10:15.849 --> 10:17.985
We're looking for Devon.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.221
Devon! Customers.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.994
Hello!

10:28.528 --> 10:29.763
How you doing?

10:29.797 --> 10:31.264
Oh, snap.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.166
Can I help y'all find something?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.868
I think we found him.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.604
Cookie Lyon,
from Lyon Family Management.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.207
-The Cookie Lyon?
-The only one, baby.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.942
Wait till I tell
my sister about this.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.611
-Uh, this is Porsha, A&R.
-How you doing?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.880
We heard you in the background
of an Instagram video.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.548
But it was your beautiful voice

10:48.581 --> 10:51.852
that cut through
all of the clutter.

10:51.885 --> 10:55.055
I've been praying for a sign,
and here y'all are.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.524
And I've been praying
for a man...

10:57.557 --> 11:00.227
Why don't you let me hear
a little bit of that song?

11:00.260 --> 11:02.896
Please.

11:02.930 --> 11:07.567
* What would you do
if you knew *

11:07.600 --> 11:10.738
* Sometimes I'm hiding

11:10.771 --> 11:13.306
* Sometimes I'm cool on you

11:13.340 --> 11:16.376
* You, baby.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.912
That's just a little bit of it.
I have a lot...

11:18.946 --> 11:21.481
Mm-mm-mm.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.016
I'm gonna make you a star.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.019
A superstar.
I want to manage you.

11:26.053 --> 11:30.323
God, you-- Twice in one day.
This is crazy.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.226
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what
you mean "twice in one day"?

11:33.260 --> 11:34.494
BECKY:
Oh, yeah, he's really excited.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.029
All right, let me-- Okay.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.398
I'm gonna bring him down right
now. I'll call you back. Hi!

11:38.431 --> 11:42.569
Hey, good "mornting."

11:42.602 --> 11:45.238
Hey, Becky.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.249
Well, well, well.
Look at you, Becky.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.685
Waking up bright and early,
snatching up

11:58.718 --> 12:01.588
the next best thing.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.256
How did you beat us here, Becky?

12:03.290 --> 12:08.128
Empire has an A&R algorithm,
and Devon is trending.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.697
Oh, so you're letting computers
do the work for you now.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.965
That's lazy.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.935
Okay, look,
I don't want to fight.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.870
Kingsley's never gonna let me
sign any of your artists,

12:16.904 --> 12:19.139
and I got here first.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.640
You can get the next one.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.910
No, no, this is far from over.

12:22.943 --> 12:27.147
Because I'm not gonna let
this talented young brother

12:27.180 --> 12:29.382
trade in one slimy,
grimy junkyard for another.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.119
Devon, why don't you
tell Ms. Cookie all about how

12:32.152 --> 12:33.386
I'm gonna take you
down to Empire

12:33.420 --> 12:34.654
and give you
the full-court press,

12:34.687 --> 12:36.824
just the way she
and Lucious taught me.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.259
You know what?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.094
You are a very respectful
young man,

12:41.128 --> 12:43.163
and I-I really appreciate that.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.598
I want you to go down
and check out this circus

12:45.632 --> 12:47.300
they gonna show you.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.601
But make me a promise.

12:48.635 --> 12:51.738
Don't sign anything
until you let Cookie show you

12:51.771 --> 12:52.973
what she can do for you.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.408
Okay? All right?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.477
Well, let me get him out
of your kung fu grip.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.146
-If I can just...
-Okay, you good, girl.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.815
-Go ahead...
-There are more singers
on Instagram, Cookie.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.450
-You got it. Next time.
-Bye.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.953
Don't forget, I made
my sons stars. I did that.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.188
All right? I could take you
to the top, baby.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.858
-(sighs)
-You know when he see Empire,

13:10.891 --> 13:12.625
he gonna think he died
and went to hip-hop heaven.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.794
-How we supposed to compete
with that?
-You know what?

13:14.828 --> 13:17.297
I am going to need you to be
a little more professional.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.334
Change that outfit.
You look like a box of Skittles.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.036
You don't like this?

13:23.070 --> 13:24.371
I thought you liked these.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.173
Where did we park
the car, Porsha?

13:26.206 --> 13:27.975
Down there.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.642
* Stop, drop

13:29.676 --> 13:32.980
* Shut 'em down, open up shop

13:33.013 --> 13:36.116
-* Oh, no...
-Andre.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.550
What are you doing here?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.319
Damn. Lucious Lyon.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.689
Sonny.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.057
You old head.
How you holding up?

13:44.091 --> 13:45.993
Oh, bobbing and weaving,
like I do.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.029
Well, I think you remember
my eldest.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.498
Andre, I thought that was you.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.800
A grown-ass man.
Heard you just got out.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.735
-Welcome home.
-Thank you, Sonny.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.005
Well, listen, Sonny, you know
why I'm here, right?

13:58.038 --> 14:01.208
Lucious, I got a couple
of contenders,

14:01.241 --> 14:03.376
but I'm still living
month to month.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.046
Sonny, I wouldn't be here

14:06.079 --> 14:08.815
unless it was
absolutely necessary.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.718
For every 20 fighters
I got training here,

14:11.751 --> 14:14.154
there's maybe one
that's special.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.356
You've got a couple of fighters
with some pretty big wins

14:16.389 --> 14:17.524
in the last six months,

14:17.557 --> 14:19.026
and you definitely haven't
invested those funds

14:19.059 --> 14:21.194
in the upkeep,
that's for damn sure.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.063
LUCIOUS:
Well, you know how they say,

14:23.096 --> 14:26.066
it's like the music business,
Andre, sometimes.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.436
The hits pay for
the many painful losses.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.105
Exactly right.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.841
I'll get your money.
I just need a little time.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.709
I know we'll work something out.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.779
Mm-hmm.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.117
* Stop, drop

14:44.151 --> 14:46.686
* Shut 'em down, open up shop.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.122
What the hell were you
doing there?

14:49.156 --> 14:51.724
I figured you'd come here first.
Sonny's got the biggest tab.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.526
Boy, have you lost your mind?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.462
First you disobey me,
and then you're gonna interfere

14:55.495 --> 14:56.796
when I'm trying to collect?

14:56.829 --> 14:59.933
"Boy"? "Disobey you"?
Pop, I'm a man.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.268
That's not how
this works anymore.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.302
-Oh, is that right?
-That's right.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.037
And you let Sonny off easy.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.039
-I was just trying to help you.
-You want to help me?

15:06.073 --> 15:08.541
Learn how to keep
your damn mouth shut.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.078
An-And watch and listen
and learn!

15:11.111 --> 15:12.980
How do you know
he doesn't have it, Pop?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.147
Because I know Sonny.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.949
You walked out of there
empty-handed.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.384
I didn't want you to look weak.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.552
That would have got me
killed on the inside, Pop.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.088
I'm telling you, son,
don't be one of them fools

15:21.121 --> 15:22.489
running around here
wearing your time

15:22.522 --> 15:23.957
like it's some badge of honor!

15:23.991 --> 15:25.458
You were in there
'cause you got caught.

15:25.492 --> 15:28.061
Ain't no honor in that.
I walked in there,

15:28.095 --> 15:30.497
and I talked to Sonny
my damn self.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.599
I didn't send
a bag man or a goon.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.467
That speaks volumes for me.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.403
Or does it mean you couldn't
afford backup, Pop?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.938
Didn't you tell the whole world
the Lyons are flat-ass broke?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.308
I'll tell you what,
if Sonny tells the streets

15:41.341 --> 15:42.976
that Lucious Lyon has gone soft,

15:43.010 --> 15:46.679
Pop, we won't collect a dime.
Not a nickel!

15:46.713 --> 15:49.983
You spent time in there,
served time, did a bid.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.918
Now you gonna tell me
how the streets--

15:51.951 --> 15:54.021
Man, get in the car.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.358
KINGSLEY:
True talent is rare.

15:58.391 --> 16:02.262
But a triple threat--
presence, songwriting chops,

16:02.295 --> 16:04.764
and a voice to match--
it's one in a million.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.435
-And you, Devon,
are one in a million.
-(laughs)

16:08.468 --> 16:10.270
And what we need to do
is take you

16:10.303 --> 16:14.374
from singing background
on Instagram to...

16:14.407 --> 16:16.209
...winning Album of the Year
at the Grammys.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.312
That would be amazing.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.481
* Trust in love

16:21.514 --> 16:25.285
-(cheers and applause)
-* That's what they told me

16:25.318 --> 16:27.020
* Or else you'll be lonely

16:27.054 --> 16:32.159
* I just really want to
touch someone... *

16:32.192 --> 16:34.961
That's my song right there.
How did y'all do that?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.697
-A remix is easy.
-Mm-hmm.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.234
Making you a star, it's a
million times more complicated.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.471
But Empire has something
that nobody else has.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.574
Proprietary analytics.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.409
We know everything
about your audience.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.878
Where they live, what they eat,
what they watch,

16:51.911 --> 16:53.913
and exactly who they're
listening to.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.916
And the data tells us
that a male R&B singer

16:56.949 --> 16:59.219
-needs to have serious swag.
-Mm-hmm.

16:59.252 --> 17:04.091
-Abs, condos, cars, women.
-Mm-hmm.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.726
We'll mold you into
what every man wants to be,

17:06.759 --> 17:08.195
and every woman wants
to sleep with.

17:08.228 --> 17:12.999
So, are you trying to turn me
into a singer or a stripper?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.934
Uh, I just--

17:14.967 --> 17:17.704
I never saw Ne-Yo
have to take off his clothes.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.673
No offense, Mr. Kingsley,

17:20.707 --> 17:23.110
I just-- I don't know
if all of that is me.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.879
-I mean...
-Luther, Marvin, Teddy,

17:26.913 --> 17:28.081
D'Angelo.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.350
The Mount Rushmore of R&B.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.587
And we knew them
by only one name.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.922
And despite the data--

17:35.955 --> 17:39.292
and trust me, it's all legit--

17:39.326 --> 17:42.095
there's still a little magic
left in what we do around here.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.697
See, what you get with Empire

17:44.731 --> 17:47.267
is our ability
to make you a star.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.070
But faster and bigger
than anybody else.

17:51.104 --> 17:55.074
We want to put your face
on the mountain.

17:55.108 --> 17:59.412
Marvin, Luther, Teddy,

17:59.446 --> 18:00.947
(whispering):
D'Angelo...

18:03.450 --> 18:04.784
Devon.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.121
(laughing)

18:08.155 --> 18:09.889
-That sounds good.
-Yeah?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.124
(mouthing)

18:11.158 --> 18:12.825
KINGSLEY:
All right, Becky and Giselle

18:12.859 --> 18:14.827
will show you
to the recording studios.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.563
-Yes.
-We have 11. Take your pick.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.299
-Wow.
-Stop bragging.
He's always bragging.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.101
*

18:23.536 --> 18:25.138
It's like it's you,
but it's not you.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.106
Does that mean you like it
or you don't like it?

18:27.140 --> 18:29.509
It's dope, but it's different.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.943
Yeah, it's for Kai.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.279
It's like me and Tiana.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.814
When we first met,
she changed my sound.

18:34.847 --> 18:35.915
You tell her that?

18:35.948 --> 18:39.352
You know, Mal,
when you love someone,

18:39.386 --> 18:40.920
they always put something on it.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.022
Yeah, they do.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.962
(phone chimes)

19:01.874 --> 19:03.610
Hell no.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.612
(bell tolling)

19:05.645 --> 19:07.547
(horns honking)

19:15.021 --> 19:17.123
So what'd you do,
you drugged me to get on TV?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.991
-(scoffs)
Good morning to you, too.
-Nah, nah, nah.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.327
I'm sorry, I'm sick of
people like you.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.862
You said all of that BS
about paparazzi,

19:22.895 --> 19:24.797
about us not being in New York,
but in actuality,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.466
you're the trash that's
trying to be on tabloids.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.901
What in the hell do you
even get out of that?

19:28.935 --> 19:31.070
Are you done?
Because if you are,

19:31.103 --> 19:32.805
you'd know that I didn't know
we were being followed.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.407
Oh, and if I did,

19:34.441 --> 19:36.008
I would have hidden my face
with my sweatshirt,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.877
'cause getting caught with
a-a messy, drugged-out

19:37.910 --> 19:40.247
American pop star-- that's
poison for a real journalist.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.150
Wait.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.520
Hold up.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.188
What'd you save me for, then?

19:49.222 --> 19:51.358
I don't like seeing people
getting taken advantage of.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.026
It's kind of my job.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.028
Yo, um...

19:58.298 --> 19:59.832
Look, that's my bad.

19:59.866 --> 20:04.203
I... I'm sorry.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.909
I don't usually meet people
that don't want anything.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.445
That's a topic you could spend
all day with your therapist on.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.247
Probably.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.783
(chuckles) Can I go?

20:16.816 --> 20:18.751
Why don't you let me
take you to dinner?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.521
I don't think so.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.791
All right, look,
I promise I'll be...

20:24.824 --> 20:28.428
33% less messy.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.796
-33?
-That's a big deal for me.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.632
How about I'll think
about it? 33%.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.734
(both laugh)

20:41.808 --> 20:43.776
(elevator bell dings)

20:46.279 --> 20:48.448
Jamal? Eric Nelson.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.751
Keem, this is
Kai's assignment editor.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.553
You got good news?

20:53.586 --> 20:57.324
I promised Kai, uh, if we were
ever in this situation...

20:57.357 --> 21:00.226
What situation?

21:00.259 --> 21:03.229
We haven't heard anything
from him in at least 48 hours.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.798
We're using every contact
that we have.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.767
But, in that part of the world,
after this much time,

21:07.800 --> 21:10.770
I have to be honest,
we're worried.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.182
(chuckles)

21:23.215 --> 21:24.784
I get it.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.486
You've been
to the almighty Empire,

21:26.519 --> 21:28.120
so why in the hell
would you sign with folks

21:28.154 --> 21:29.589
working out
of their house, right?

21:29.622 --> 21:33.292
Empire told you
who they'd turn you into.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.695
But did they ask you
who you are?

21:35.728 --> 21:38.498
What do you... what do you mean?

21:38.531 --> 21:41.534
I mean, what motivates you, son?

21:41.568 --> 21:44.270
(sighs) I love my sister.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.538
That's sweet.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.207
-And I love singing in church.
-Right.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.009
No, okay, that's beautiful.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.711
Where does your music
come from, boy?

21:51.744 --> 21:53.012
I don't, I don't know.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.547
-You don't know?
-I don't know. It...

21:54.581 --> 21:55.982
It just comes.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.617
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.320
Nothing that inspired
just comes.

22:01.354 --> 22:05.392
Now, where does your music
come from?

22:05.425 --> 22:09.562
My heart.

22:09.596 --> 22:10.997
It comes from my soul.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.534
Yes. God has blessed you, Devon.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.537
(chuckles) But all the talent

22:17.570 --> 22:19.406
in the world ain't worth
a hill of beans

22:19.439 --> 22:21.007
if it's used the wrong way.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.876
Why don't you let this family
guide you, and we'll take you

22:23.910 --> 22:25.945
right to the top.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.151
(both laugh)

22:32.184 --> 22:34.587
Can I...

22:34.621 --> 22:38.224
Can I get a minute
to talk to my sister

22:38.257 --> 22:40.326
before I sign?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.429
Sure. Yeah.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.898
-(sighs)
-Don't take too long now.

22:45.932 --> 22:46.966
(chuckles)

22:56.609 --> 22:58.044
This is all you found?

22:58.077 --> 23:00.413
Look, Kingsley's
a Boy Scout, okay?

23:00.447 --> 23:02.949
I could've googled this.
What am I paying you for?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.216
Just wait for it.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.686
See, I've been tailing him,
and turns out

23:06.719 --> 23:08.521
dude loves a field trip.

23:08.555 --> 23:12.091
He's been visiting
a women's prison upstate.

23:14.794 --> 23:15.895
Okay.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.433
(alarm buzzes)

23:25.004 --> 23:26.939
(door locks, keys jangle)

23:38.851 --> 23:40.787
*

24:05.011 --> 24:06.646
BATTAGLIA:
Thank you, Remo.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.081
Here's to new ventures.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.517
Salut.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.752
So I hear you're
out collecting, Lucious.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.122
Word gets around.

24:16.155 --> 24:19.992
Well, you know how expensive
new ventures can be, Mike.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.193
You know,

24:21.227 --> 24:25.598
the two years ago Lucious Lyon,
king of the world,

24:25.632 --> 24:27.099
walks in here,

24:27.133 --> 24:28.835
I'm shaking in my moccasins,

24:28.868 --> 24:32.004
but the today Lucious
walks into my place

24:32.038 --> 24:33.506
begging for his money back?

24:33.540 --> 24:37.510
My answer is you get bupkes,
not a red cent.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.045
Oh, you trying to be
funny right now?

24:39.078 --> 24:41.013
-What? You want something,
big man?
-Easy, Pop.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.350
Gentlemen, if I may, maybe
we can negotiate a settlement.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.186
Now you got something
to say, Mr. MBA?

24:51.558 --> 24:52.692
(screaming)

24:55.427 --> 24:57.163
Where's the safe? Safe!

24:57.196 --> 24:59.398
-Behind the gold record!
-What's the combo?

24:59.431 --> 25:01.267
-3-2-1.
-Figures.

25:06.372 --> 25:08.040
This all you got?

25:08.074 --> 25:09.742
Where's the rest
of my damn money?!

25:09.776 --> 25:11.510
-I'll get you the rest, I swear.
-Do something.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.115
I'm coming back here, man.
I want my money.

25:22.589 --> 25:25.725
That's the money
pulled out of that safe.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.894
Now that's two grand,
and it'll get us through

25:27.927 --> 25:31.263
a hard time or two,
but at what cost?

25:31.297 --> 25:33.199
What you did in that office
was reckless.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.067
-I know what I'm doing.
-Do you?

25:35.101 --> 25:38.370
We will have no future, Pop,

25:38.404 --> 25:41.741
if we don't make it clear
to anybody, anybody

25:41.774 --> 25:44.677
who gets in our way:
we will get what's ours.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.113
I'm the father!

25:47.146 --> 25:50.249
If somebody's got to risk
their life for this family,

25:50.282 --> 25:51.884
it's gonna be me.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.353
That's my job.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.022
Now, I know that
you went in there

25:56.055 --> 25:59.058
and you learned a few things,
but somehow along the way,

25:59.091 --> 26:01.360
when they took your name
and gave you a number,

26:01.393 --> 26:06.232
you've forgotten your value
to me, to this business,

26:06.265 --> 26:09.101
-to this family.
-I know my worth, Pop.

26:09.135 --> 26:13.606
How can you create
the next Empire XStream

26:13.640 --> 26:16.142
if you're beating somebody up
in an alleyway?

26:16.175 --> 26:19.912
Now, I told you

26:19.946 --> 26:24.116
I'm the one that put
that fire in you.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.585
Let me show you
how to control it,

26:26.619 --> 26:28.655
how to hone it.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.692
Okay.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.303
CHILDREN:
* You're so beautiful

26:44.336 --> 26:45.772
KAI:
* Shake it, shake it

26:45.805 --> 26:48.140
CHILDREN:
* I don't care who knows

26:48.174 --> 26:50.609
* Move it, move, go up, down,
up, down, up, down *

26:50.643 --> 26:52.344
* Go up, down, up, down,
up, down *

26:52.378 --> 26:53.680
KAI:
* Shake it fast

26:53.713 --> 26:55.748
CHILDREN:
* You're so beautiful

26:55.782 --> 26:57.249
KAI:
* Shake it, shake it

26:57.283 --> 26:59.318
* And I don't care who knows

26:59.351 --> 27:00.787
* Move it, move, go up

27:00.820 --> 27:02.421
* Down, up, down, up, down

27:02.454 --> 27:04.090
* Go up, down,
up, down, up, down *

27:04.123 --> 27:05.992
* Go up, down, up, down,
up, down... *

27:06.025 --> 27:07.794
I would like some more,
Mr. Lyon.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.962
-Mm-hmm.
-(chuckles)

27:11.497 --> 27:13.332
Oh, all right, heavy hand.
(laughs)

27:13.365 --> 27:15.935
What is that?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.203
(Kai chuckles)

27:17.236 --> 27:19.939
Vincit omnia veritas.
What is that?

27:19.972 --> 27:23.175
-Truth conquers all.
-Mm.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.111
They teach you that
in journalism school?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.545
Something like that.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.148
(laughs) Okay, so it's not--
obviously not that.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.616
So what is it?
What's the story?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.184
Who said there's a story?

27:32.218 --> 27:34.420
Oh, really?
You just gonna not tell me?

27:36.188 --> 27:37.790
Eh, we're not there yet.

27:37.824 --> 27:41.193
Oh, okay. It's just a tattoo.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.729
So which button is the autotune?

27:42.762 --> 27:44.130
Oh, autotune, really?

27:44.163 --> 27:46.132
-Is it, um, that one over there?
-You know, it's actually

27:46.165 --> 27:48.400
this button right here next to

27:48.434 --> 27:50.502
your teleprompter.
Yeah, there it is.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.004
Ah, touché.

27:52.038 --> 27:55.541
So what's your favorite place
that you've ever been?

27:55.574 --> 27:57.409
Dakar, Senegal.

27:58.544 --> 28:01.080
-(music playing)
-Mm.

28:01.113 --> 28:04.316
-Tell me why it's so special.
-Oh, it-it's beautiful, loud,

28:04.350 --> 28:06.385
chaotic, and-and
it's got the most

28:06.418 --> 28:08.955
fiery orange sunset
I've ever seen in my life.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.733
It's Dakar.

28:20.767 --> 28:24.070
I mean, not exactly, but...

28:24.103 --> 28:26.538
it's what I love
to do with my music,

28:26.572 --> 28:28.975
make people feel
what I'm feeling.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.692
You want to go to the bedroom?

28:46.725 --> 28:49.628
I've got to go to the office
early tomorrow.

28:49.661 --> 28:53.265
Oh, yeah, yeah, cool, cool.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.367
(chuckles) Yeah, um...

28:55.401 --> 28:57.870
A crazy early morning, too,
so no worries.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.738
-I'll call you.
-Yeah.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.207
But this-this was fun.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.809
We should, we should
do this again sometime.

29:02.842 --> 29:06.112
-JAMAL: Definitely.
-KAI: Okay, cool.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.417
* Yeah

29:11.450 --> 29:12.885
* My life flashes

29:12.919 --> 29:15.054
* Ahead is my desertion

29:15.087 --> 29:18.424
* His trigger finger makes me
contemplate if I deserve it *

29:18.457 --> 29:20.426
* I'd be damned if my family
would take the hit *

29:20.459 --> 29:22.929
* So be a man
and step in front *

29:22.962 --> 29:24.763
* Of this angry man
without a purpose, yeah *

29:24.797 --> 29:26.498
* Tell me this ain't
a conclusion *

29:26.532 --> 29:27.934
* My body can barely react

29:27.967 --> 29:29.836
* I'm thinking
it's just an illusion *

29:29.869 --> 29:31.403
* But the bullet
is telling me facts *

29:31.437 --> 29:33.339
* 'Cause my whole world
is in a spin *

29:33.372 --> 29:35.107
* If they ain't breathing,
I ain't living *

29:35.141 --> 29:36.408
* Can't express this feeling,
praying *

29:36.442 --> 29:38.144
* Give me one more minute,
yeah *

29:38.177 --> 29:40.746
* Lost all control
in the blink of an eye *

29:40.779 --> 29:44.083
* Just a single thought
went across my mind *

29:44.116 --> 29:46.185
* I'm asking, I'm begging,
I'm pleading *

29:46.218 --> 29:47.954
* Just for one more minute

29:47.987 --> 29:49.255
* One more minute

29:49.288 --> 29:52.424
* Eyes open up

29:52.458 --> 29:53.993
* No, it's not my time

29:54.026 --> 29:55.527
* Need to make a choice

29:55.561 --> 29:56.963
-* Am I willing to fight
-Okay.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.630
* I'm asking, I'm begging

29:58.664 --> 30:00.799
* I'm pleading
just for one more minute *

30:00.833 --> 30:02.869
-* One more minute.
-Yo!

30:02.902 --> 30:06.105
Okay, okay. What you been doing?
I see what you been doing now.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.206
I know, right.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.340
-So, look.
-Yo.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.309
This is your best work.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.544
Nah, nah, your hook
is what kills it.

30:12.578 --> 30:13.980
-Yeah.
-Whatever.

30:14.013 --> 30:17.316
It just feels good
to finally get it out, you know?

30:17.349 --> 30:18.517
Yeah.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.519
That's why I hit you up

30:20.552 --> 30:23.389
so that we can
cut the record today.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.692
Okay, but this isn't
for the world to hear.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.694
W-Why not?

30:28.727 --> 30:31.397
-(laughs)
-It's our story. It's real.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.699
Yeah. It's too real.

30:33.732 --> 30:36.135
I'll record it with you,

30:36.168 --> 30:40.072
but only if you promise me
that it's just for us,

30:40.106 --> 30:41.507
nobody but you and me.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.976
-Okay. You ready?
-Yeah.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.577
-All right, let's do it then.
-Yeah. Let's do it.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.413
Start it from the top. (laughs)

30:50.449 --> 30:52.684
(knocking on door)

30:58.690 --> 31:01.027
Uh, hi, I'm Cookie Lyon.
I'm looking for Devon.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.395
-He was supposed to sign
some papers.
-He's not here.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.731
I'm his sister, Janae.
You want to come in?

31:05.764 --> 31:06.933
Okay.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.035
He's told me all about you

31:09.068 --> 31:12.838
and Lucious and Jamal
and Hakeem. (chuckles)

31:12.871 --> 31:14.606
He's so excited.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.442
Yeah, he's really talented.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.377
It's a gift.

31:18.410 --> 31:22.281
Uh, is it just you two?

31:22.314 --> 31:25.284
Yeah, we lost our parents
a few years ago.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.586
I'm so sorry.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.056
Thank you.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.690
Sit.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.693
Okay.
(clears throat)

31:34.726 --> 31:36.862
Ugh, I move real slow,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.330
-but I get there eventually.
-Ah.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.970
I need surgery on this hip,
but Medicare won't cover it,

31:44.003 --> 31:45.471
and since I stopped working,

31:45.504 --> 31:47.273
Devon's working,
like, four jobs.

31:47.306 --> 31:48.874
I hate that he has to do
all that for me.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.109
I'm sure he's not keeping tally.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.577
You'd do the same thing for him.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.712
That's what family does, right?

31:53.745 --> 31:58.450
(chuckles): That sounds
like something my mom would say.

31:58.484 --> 32:01.053
He should be home soon.
You're welcome to wait.

32:01.087 --> 32:04.256
Uh, you know, I have
another meeting I should get to.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.825
But, um, is there something
you would like

32:06.858 --> 32:08.827
-for me to help you with
in here?
-Oh, I'm good.

32:08.860 --> 32:09.861
Um, you want to leave
those papers?

32:11.998 --> 32:14.133
Uh...

32:14.166 --> 32:16.868
no, I'm okay. Thank you.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.013
Becky. Come on in.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.715
-You call me over here to gloat?
-(chuckles)

32:32.851 --> 32:34.987
Um...

32:35.021 --> 32:40.259
Devon is yours, okay?
We're dropping out.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.693
Why?

32:41.727 --> 32:44.763
I can't give him what he needs
right now. Empire can.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.832
And like Lucious says...

32:46.865 --> 32:49.101
-The artist comes first. I know.
-Yes.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.037
-Mm-hmm.
-He said that to me
when he hired me

32:51.070 --> 32:53.005
to be his assistant
and you reminded me of that

32:53.039 --> 32:54.540
the day you promoted me
to head of A&R.

32:54.573 --> 32:58.810
Becky, promise me
you'll get his contract signed.

32:58.844 --> 33:04.116
Okay, get him
that signing money ASAP.

33:04.150 --> 33:07.719
Cookie, I promise you.
I'm gonna take care of him.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.655
Okay.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.990
Okay, we'll pick up
same time tomorrow, okay?

33:12.024 --> 33:14.160
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-All right, good night.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.561
Hey.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.996
Where you going?

33:18.030 --> 33:19.498
What are you doing here?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.200
You do remember I used
to work here, right?

33:22.701 --> 33:26.305
Well, it's late, so,
I'm-a just go home.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.006
I've been home already.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.409
I fed the babies,
put them to sleep.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.478
I even gave the nanny
a little extra to stay.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.880
Hakeem, you can't just do that.

33:34.913 --> 33:37.249
Babe, you've been working hard.

33:37.283 --> 33:38.850
I've got something for you.

33:38.884 --> 33:42.054
I-I want to show you
how much I appreciate you.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.555
Come on, let me show you, look.

33:46.225 --> 33:49.195
Just for you, babe.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.698
* Can you focus on me?

33:52.731 --> 33:54.600
I know you like that,
so I made sure

33:54.633 --> 33:59.004
the chef cooked that for you.
Hey, check it out.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.273
Thank you.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.842
Tee, I'm sorry
I'm doing this on the fly,

34:03.875 --> 34:06.945
but I can hold you down.

34:06.978 --> 34:10.849
* Have the faucet's running
and I keep looking at you *

34:10.882 --> 34:16.122
* Stuck on your phone and
you're stuck in your zone *

34:16.155 --> 34:18.090
* You don't have a clue...

34:18.124 --> 34:20.526
Look...

34:20.559 --> 34:25.964
this is, this is really nice,
but we can't, Hakeem.

34:25.997 --> 34:27.933
Everybody went home, babe.

34:27.966 --> 34:32.138
* Lately I've been
a little fed up *

34:32.171 --> 34:37.143
* Wish you would
just focus on me... *

34:37.176 --> 34:40.379
No, nah, nah,
tonight not about me.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.049
It's about you.

34:44.082 --> 34:48.554
* Look me in my eyes

34:48.587 --> 34:51.123
* Ooh.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.292
LUCIOUS:
Hey, how was Devon?

34:53.325 --> 34:55.361
Did he hiccup at the contract?

34:57.529 --> 35:01.533
(sighs)
We said no secrets, right?

35:03.635 --> 35:05.103
Tell me we didn't lose him.

35:05.137 --> 35:08.240
No, I just gave him up
to Empire.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.409
-You what?
-I couldn't look
that boy in the face

35:10.442 --> 35:12.944
and tell him I didn't know
when his money was coming.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.346
His family's broke,
he needs...

35:14.380 --> 35:17.316
Baby, we're broke.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.485
Look, I know your heart's
in the right place, baby,

35:19.518 --> 35:21.920
but all we needed was one month

35:21.953 --> 35:23.855
and we could've got him
a major label deal.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.524
Well, he didn't have
a month, okay?

35:25.557 --> 35:27.759
And I made a decision.
How about that?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.095
-Put some salt and pepper...
-Mr. Lucious.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.531
-Ms. Cookie. You have a guest.
-COOKIE: Devon.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.300
Lucious, this is Devon.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.135
You didn't have to come
all the way out here

35:37.169 --> 35:38.604
to tell me you signed
with Empire.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.272
I know, I understand.

35:40.306 --> 35:43.642
(sighs) No, I came to tell you
that I turned it down.

35:48.046 --> 35:49.114
What are you saying?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.482
Honestly,

35:50.516 --> 35:52.551
Empire showed me
a whole nother world.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.853
And it was everything
that I could imagine,

35:54.886 --> 35:56.955
but you guys made me feel
like I was home.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.491
What about Janae?

35:59.525 --> 36:01.327
She said you made her feel
like family as well.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.295
Well... (chuckles)

36:03.329 --> 36:04.730
Well, come on,
I know you hungry.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.398
Welcome to the family.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.667
Hey, Lucious,
get an extra plate.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.737
-Wow. This kitchen
is pretty crazy.
-(Cookie chuckles)

36:11.770 --> 36:14.706
That was real honorable
what you did, man.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.576
Here, why don't you put that
on them eggs

36:17.609 --> 36:20.078
until you can make
some gold ones with us.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.251
-Family comes first here.
-COOKIE: That's right.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.686
Welcome to ours. We got you.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.422
Thank you, Mr. Lyon. Thank you.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.924
You're so welcome.
Now get some silverware.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.661
-You got to bring your sister
over here sometimes.
-I will.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.096
Welcome home, baby. (chuckles)

36:46.438 --> 36:48.774
(knock on door)

36:52.378 --> 36:54.380
You all right? What's going on?

36:54.413 --> 36:56.315
Um...

36:58.450 --> 37:00.419
This is my reminder of a time

37:00.452 --> 37:03.922
when I-I didn't
look out for myself.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.191
I let somebody lie to me
and this...

37:06.224 --> 37:09.361
well, this tattoo is a reminder
of the power of the truth.

37:09.395 --> 37:13.031
You know it's, like,
6:00 in the morning, right?

37:13.064 --> 37:16.868
When I was diagnosed
three years ago, I...

37:16.902 --> 37:18.304
I thought my world
was gonna end.

37:20.639 --> 37:24.042
I'm HIV-positive,
but I'm undetectable.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.711
If you don't know what
that means, it's...

37:25.744 --> 37:27.479
No, of course I know
what it means.

37:30.115 --> 37:34.620
The virus is really low in your
blood, so it's hard to transmit.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.222
Yeah. I didn't want
to have this conversation

37:37.255 --> 37:39.925
while we were kissing,
so I-I just figured I'd...

37:39.958 --> 37:42.961
6:00 in the morning
is the way to go. (chuckles)

37:42.994 --> 37:46.097
Jamal, I don't want you
to think that I'm not interested

37:46.131 --> 37:49.768
because I am...

37:49.801 --> 37:51.937
very much.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.506
But if-if you don't want to,
if you don't want to do this...

37:54.540 --> 37:57.443
Why wouldn't I want to?
I don't...

37:57.476 --> 38:00.579
Some people got a problem
with it and...

38:00.612 --> 38:02.848
I was afraid you would, too.

38:09.220 --> 38:13.992
I guess I should
let you know that...

38:14.025 --> 38:17.262
I'm negative, so...

38:17.295 --> 38:19.064
I know how to stay that way.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.435
So I don't have
a problem with it.

38:23.469 --> 38:27.506
I think you're perfect.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.616
Mm. Don't get excited.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.452
We're going back to sleep.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.087
Come on.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.190
BECKY:
Hey, hon.

38:50.195 --> 38:53.565
What's going on? You okay?

38:53.599 --> 38:57.335
They can't find him and it's
not some off-the-grid thing.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.539
Okay, so that means to me

39:00.572 --> 39:02.140
that he's still
out there somewhere...

39:02.173 --> 39:04.643
-Please, come on, man, please.
-No, really.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.311
Only reason why he took
this stupid-ass gig

39:06.344 --> 39:07.713
is because I made him come here.

39:10.549 --> 39:13.318
-Where the hell did I put it?
-What are you looking for?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.353
-Just let me help you.
-I put it somewhere smart

39:15.387 --> 39:17.823
'cause he's so damn nosy.
All he did was ever search...

39:17.856 --> 39:19.791
Okay, Jamal,
you need to calm down.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.933
Did you find it?

39:31.570 --> 39:34.573
I was gonna ask him, but...

39:34.606 --> 39:39.110
before he left, but, um...

39:39.144 --> 39:41.813
we got into a fight, so...

39:45.917 --> 39:48.353
Jamal.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.823
It was gonna be
so perfect, though.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.636
I called because
I didn't know what to do.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.572
-He's freaking out and...
-You did the right thing.

40:06.605 --> 40:09.240
-Where are you going?
-Going to look for him.

40:09.274 --> 40:12.110
Oh, no, no, no. So, you
gonna go to a war country

40:12.143 --> 40:13.979
and get yourself lost, too?
I don't think so.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.747
JAMAL:
What are they saying?

40:15.781 --> 40:17.449
(Lucious sighs)

40:17.483 --> 40:19.485
Nobody's seen him
for three days.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.286
Exactly, so I'm going.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.954
You can't go running off
to another continent

40:22.988 --> 40:24.456
without a plan, Jamal.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.658
No, that's all right, Mal.
I'll go with you.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.293
-Wait, wait, no, no.
Everybody stop.
-Okay, now.

40:28.326 --> 40:32.130
Now, look, Mal, I know
how you feel about Kai.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.732
And, I mean, if it was
your mom or your brothers,

40:33.765 --> 40:35.333
I'd be the first one
on the plane...

40:35.366 --> 40:36.968
-Yeah, exactly, so please
just let me go.
-No.

40:37.002 --> 40:39.304
This ain't about to be
a Lyon family production.

40:39.337 --> 40:40.839
No, what we need to do is wait.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.841
I've got a call
into the State Department.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.776
Somebody's gonna give me
some more answers.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.412
I promise. Just be patient.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.114
Patient, okay?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.487
You're not telling me
something, I know that.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.259
Son, um...

41:01.292 --> 41:04.295
they found his wallet
and his cell phone

41:04.329 --> 41:06.732
on the side of a road.

41:09.501 --> 41:12.938
Does that mean that he's dead?

41:12.971 --> 41:15.306
What did they say? Did they say
that that means that he's dead?

41:15.340 --> 41:18.810
That doesn't mean that he's...
No, it doesn't.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.780
-No, baby. It's just,
we don't know yet, baby.
-No.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.448
-So, who does know?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, just...

41:23.481 --> 41:25.283
Wait, Mom. Hold on, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Hold on one second.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.819
-We can't just wait, we...
-No, no, no, no, no.

41:27.853 --> 41:31.122
-I need you to calm down.
-No, Mom.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.525
It's okay. There's nothing
we can do right now.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.694
-(crying): I love him so much.
-Okay? I know.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.496
(crying):
I love him so much.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.465
COOKIE:
It's-it's okay.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.001
We gonna get through this,
all right?

41:43.034 --> 41:44.202
(alarm buzzes)

41:51.276 --> 41:55.313
Oh. All of a sudden,
I'm so popular. (chuckles)

41:55.346 --> 41:58.817
Nice to make
your acquaintance, Ms....

41:58.850 --> 42:03.321
Giselle. Sims. Formerly Barker.

42:03.354 --> 42:08.093
Oh, one of Eddie Barker's
many widows. May he rest.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.528
It was all very tragic.

42:12.564 --> 42:14.866
I haven't fully recovered yet.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.267
If we're going
to be friends, dear,

42:16.301 --> 42:19.037
there is one thing that is
paramount and that is honesty.

42:19.070 --> 42:21.873
How broken up about Eddie
could you possibly be

42:21.907 --> 42:24.209
when you've been carrying on
with Jeff Kingsley?

42:24.242 --> 42:27.078
He told you that?

42:27.112 --> 42:30.348
He told me many things.
He's got many secrets.

42:30.381 --> 42:34.352
(scoffs) He blindsided me,
just like the Lyons did to you.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.422
And I need them all to know
that I will never

42:37.455 --> 42:41.727
let that happen again
and I need your help.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.596
The Lyons.

42:44.630 --> 42:48.199
Oh, yes, the Lyons.

42:48.233 --> 42:52.871
Kingsley promised me
he would teach the Lyons.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.774
They need to know how it feels

42:55.807 --> 42:59.244
to put one of your own
into the ground.

43:11.623 --> 43:13.324
(exhaling):
Oh, my God.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.026
What did I do?

44:05.043 --> 44:07.045
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:09.047 --> 44:11.182
Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:11.216 --> 44:13.518
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:16.021 --> 44:17.222
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.893
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:21.927 --> 44:25.496
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:25.530 --> 44:29.067
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:29.100 --> 44:30.135
MAN: Touchdown!

44:30.168 --> 44:33.705
* Reach out *

44:33.739 --> 44:37.342
* Make this right here
right now *

44:37.375 --> 44:40.278
* Stand up *

44:41.179 --> 44:42.914
* Here right now *

44:42.948 --> 44:44.716
That sounds like fun.
