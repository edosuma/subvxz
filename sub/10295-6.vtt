00:16.067 --> 00:20.934
* Love and marriage *

00:20.969 --> 00:22.734
* Go together like *

00:22.769 --> 00:25.200
* A horse and carriage *

00:25.235 --> 00:29.200
* This I tell ya, brother *

00:29.235 --> 00:31.133
* You can't have one *

00:31.168 --> 00:34.033
* Without the other *

00:34.068 --> 00:38.934
* Love and marriage *

00:38.969 --> 00:40.334
* It's an institute *

00:40.369 --> 00:42.734
* You can't disparage *

00:42.769 --> 00:46.501
* Ask the local gentry *

00:46.536 --> 00:51.067
* And they will say
It's elementary *

00:51.102 --> 00:55.868
* Try, try, try
To separate them *

00:55.903 --> 00:59.567
* It's an illusion *

00:59.602 --> 01:04.700
* Try, try, try
And you will only come *

01:04.736 --> 01:08.133
* To this conclusion *

01:08.168 --> 01:10.234
* Love and marriage **

01:17.634 --> 01:19.734
Okay, everybody.
Gather round.

01:19.769 --> 01:23.367
I want you to watch me
pay these bills.

01:23.402 --> 01:25.767
Aren't you gonna
dress in rags

01:25.802 --> 01:27.801
like you did
last month?

01:28.934 --> 01:31.767
That was to prove
a point, Peg.

01:31.802 --> 01:34.767
A point that obviously
wasn't taken too seriously.

01:34.802 --> 01:37.701
Now, the Bundy household
is going to cut down

01:37.736 --> 01:39.200
on unnecessary
expenditures.

01:39.235 --> 01:41.601
What can we do to help?

01:43.434 --> 01:47.200
For starters, we can cut down
on our electricity.

01:47.235 --> 01:50.300
Bud, are we
in the living room?

01:51.701 --> 01:52.701
No, Dad.

01:52.736 --> 01:54.701
Then turn out
the light.

01:54.736 --> 01:55.701
Sure, Dad.

01:55.736 --> 01:57.467
Dad?

01:57.502 --> 01:58.467
What?

01:58.502 --> 02:01.400
I'm in the
living room now.

02:01.435 --> 02:03.734
You're also on thin ice.

02:03.769 --> 02:05.234
Turn out the light.

02:05.269 --> 02:08.234
Like it or not,
this family will learn to save.

02:08.269 --> 02:10.400
Where the hell are
the rest of the bills?

02:10.435 --> 02:11.734
On the coffee table,

02:11.769 --> 02:15.200
under your new $75
glow-in-the-dark tackle box.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.767
Okay. Everybody
gather round.

02:19.234 --> 02:21.734
Would somebody please
turn a light on in here?

02:21.769 --> 02:23.734
I can't see a thing.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.601
Sure, Dad.

02:25.834 --> 02:29.567
Kelly, are we
in the kitchen?

02:30.734 --> 02:31.934
No, Dad.

02:31.969 --> 02:33.334
Then what do we do?

02:34.767 --> 02:35.834
We'll learn.

02:35.869 --> 02:37.200
We'll all learn.

02:37.235 --> 02:38.701
Look at this.

02:38.736 --> 02:41.701
Everybody in the world
gets a tax refund. Not me.

02:41.736 --> 02:44.701
Me, I work in hell,
I earn nothing.

02:44.736 --> 02:47.701
Bud, where else
aren't we?

02:47.736 --> 02:49.567
In a good neighborhood?

02:51.701 --> 02:54.701
Go on upstairs and
turn out those lights.

02:54.736 --> 02:55.701
And, Kelly...

02:55.736 --> 02:57.200
Let me guess.

02:57.235 --> 03:00.701
You want me to go outside
and beg for cheese.

03:00.736 --> 03:03.200
No, I want you to cut down on
your entertainment expenditures.

03:03.235 --> 03:06.634
You know, records,
movies...bleach.

03:08.234 --> 03:10.234
Fine, but I'm
warning you.

03:10.269 --> 03:13.934
I'll steal bleach before
I give up my blondness.

03:13.969 --> 03:15.601
Good girl.

03:19.202 --> 03:20.667
You want
to get that, Al?

03:20.702 --> 03:24.667
Who spent $39.95 at a place
called 10 Little Toenails?

03:24.702 --> 03:26.033
I'll get it.

03:30.634 --> 03:33.467
Hi. We've been nut picking
and we brought you a bag.

03:33.502 --> 03:34.801
Got a nutcracker?

03:34.836 --> 03:37.100
You're looking at her.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.033
I've got one somewhere.

03:41.068 --> 03:42.734
Would you close the door.

03:42.769 --> 03:45.267
You're letting out
the heat.

03:50.234 --> 03:51.601
Is that what you make?

03:55.734 --> 03:58.234
You're gaining
a little weight there,

03:58.269 --> 03:59.601
aren't you, Marce?

04:03.234 --> 04:04.734
I found
the nutcracker.

04:04.769 --> 04:07.100
Do you think
I'm gaining weight?

04:08.234 --> 04:10.400
Eh...

04:11.802 --> 04:14.200
Al, would you get the door
for once in your life?

04:14.235 --> 04:18.233
Who the hell spent
$60 on granular facial scrub?

04:18.269 --> 04:19.634
I'll get it.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.033
Hi. Hi, Al.

04:26.068 --> 04:27.767
What do you want?

04:27.802 --> 04:29.267
I missed Marcie.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.434
Aw, look at that, Al.

04:30.469 --> 04:32.501
It's only been a few minutes,
and he misses her.

04:32.536 --> 04:34.634
Why don't you
just kill me?

04:35.767 --> 04:38.701
Close the door.
The heat's getting out.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.200
If you want to cut down
on your heating bills,

04:41.235 --> 04:42.334
do what we did.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.834
Install extra insulation.

04:43.869 --> 04:45.767
Not only is it
a monthly savings,

04:45.802 --> 04:48.367
but we got a nifty little
rebate from the government

04:48.402 --> 04:49.501
for energy
conservation.

04:49.536 --> 04:51.334
Believe me,
it had a lot to do

04:51.369 --> 04:54.067
with that big tax refund
we just got.

04:54.102 --> 04:56.801
The only thing is, we don't
know what to do with the money.

04:56.836 --> 04:58.801
Why don't you
have a couple of kids.

04:58.836 --> 05:01.801
They'll suck it up
like a Hoover.

05:01.836 --> 05:03.801
That's a vacuum
cleaner, Peg,

05:03.836 --> 05:06.801
in case you want to do
something different

05:06.836 --> 05:08.267
with your afternoons.

05:08.302 --> 05:09.868
Did we come
at a bad time?

05:09.903 --> 05:11.067
Don't mind Al.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.934
It's just his time
of the month.

05:13.969 --> 05:15.634
Bill time.

05:15.669 --> 05:17.634
So, what are you gonna spend
your refund on?

05:17.669 --> 05:21.067
We were thinking about taking
a romantic trip to Paris.

05:21.102 --> 05:23.567
I've always wanted
to go to Paris.

05:23.602 --> 05:26.834
Oh, yeah, Paris.
Where they hate Americans.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.033
Where they won't let
our bombers fly overhead.

05:29.068 --> 05:30.701
Oh, yeah, until
they get invaded.

05:30.736 --> 05:32.834
Then they come crawling back
to us, beret in hand,

05:32.869 --> 05:35.133
for us to bail them out
with my tax dollars.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.367
That's where you
want to go?

05:37.402 --> 05:40.133
No. We just said that
to kid you.

05:42.267 --> 05:43.934
We hate the French.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.133
Know what I'd do
if I had a few extra bucks?

05:46.168 --> 05:48.200
Bomb the French?

05:48.235 --> 05:51.300
No, I was talking about
a little extra money.

05:51.335 --> 05:54.300
Anyhow, I'd like to add on
to our house,

05:54.335 --> 05:57.300
you know, just to have
a little room for me.

05:57.335 --> 06:01.200
Somewhere I could go, relax,
sit back, read the paper.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.167
Another bathroom, huh?

06:05.100 --> 06:08.300
Actually, we considered
adding on to our house

06:08.335 --> 06:09.634
when we bought it,

06:09.669 --> 06:11.400
But we'd need you
to sign a variance

06:11.435 --> 06:13.834
to give us permission to build
that close to the property line

06:13.869 --> 06:15.100
and it seemed
like an imposition.

06:15.135 --> 06:16.801
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

06:16.836 --> 06:18.801
We're friends.
Aren't we, Al?

06:18.836 --> 06:20.667
Who, you and me? No.

06:21.801 --> 06:23.234
Would you really
consider it?

06:23.269 --> 06:24.934
I mean, there would be
some extra noise

06:24.969 --> 06:26.334
and dust for a while.

06:26.369 --> 06:27.834
Ah, why not?

06:27.869 --> 06:30.567
It's something we can
hold over your heads.

06:30.602 --> 06:31.767
Come on, Steve.

06:31.802 --> 06:33.834
Let's go look through
our dream house file.

06:33.869 --> 06:35.133
Hey, thanks, you guys.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.267
That was nice of you.

06:38.302 --> 06:40.267
Yeah, I'm a nice guy.

06:40.302 --> 06:43.267
What is this?
$16 for chopped sirloin?

06:43.302 --> 06:45.767
You never make me
chopped sirloin.

06:45.802 --> 06:48.634
Who the hell got
the chopped sirloin?

06:51.934 --> 06:53.801
Why do you give Buck
chopped sirloin,

06:53.836 --> 06:55.367
and I get tuna?

06:55.402 --> 06:56.801
Why doesn't he get tuna?

06:56.836 --> 06:59.167
Because tuna
makes his breath smell.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.334
And yours is hereditary.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.300
Dad.

07:10.335 --> 07:12.801
I just wanted
you to know

07:12.836 --> 07:14.300
that I've listened
to you.

07:14.335 --> 07:16.801
And I haven't spent
any money today.

07:16.836 --> 07:17.801
Good boy.

07:17.836 --> 07:20.367
Yeah. I sure hope
Kelly hasn't.

07:20.402 --> 07:23.300
Oh, my God!

07:23.335 --> 07:25.467
Kel, what's
in the bag?

07:25.502 --> 07:27.701
I bought some new jeans.

07:27.736 --> 07:29.801
Dad, you told me
to buy new jeans.

07:29.836 --> 07:32.033
You said that you hated
the way these looked.

07:32.068 --> 07:33.234
Oh, all right.

07:33.269 --> 07:34.701
Tough luck, maggot.

07:37.302 --> 07:39.767
Hey, Al.
What can I do for you?

07:39.802 --> 07:42.267
Steve, come on in.
Sit down.

07:42.302 --> 07:44.067
What are you doing?

07:45.767 --> 07:47.234
Everybody's doing this.

07:47.269 --> 07:50.267
And yes, if everyone
was jumping off of buildings,

07:50.302 --> 07:51.434
so would I.

07:52.734 --> 07:57.834
Kel, collect call for you
from Australia.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.934
Excuse me.

08:01.969 --> 08:05.267
There must be some sort
of a misunderstanding.

08:06.567 --> 08:09.300
I thought
we had code words

08:09.335 --> 08:10.801
for things like this.

08:10.836 --> 08:13.000
We're late
on our code payments.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.801
Well, a couple of years,
they'll be gone.

08:18.836 --> 08:21.801
So, Steve,
how's the addition?

08:21.836 --> 08:24.300
Well, we just talked about it
last night.

08:24.335 --> 08:27.467
We haven't had much time
to do anything about it.

08:27.502 --> 08:28.968
Yeah, good, good.

08:29.003 --> 08:31.801
I was thinking that while
the girls are at the gym,

08:31.836 --> 08:34.299
this would be
a good opportunity

08:34.335 --> 08:37.167
for us to just kind of
sit around and shoot the bull.

08:37.202 --> 08:38.833
Hey, great.

08:38.869 --> 08:41.200
Well, yesterday
at the bank-

08:41.235 --> 08:42.833
Ha ha ha ha!

08:42.869 --> 08:44.334
Great story, Steve.

08:44.369 --> 08:47.334
Listen, you know
the kind of room

08:47.369 --> 08:50.267
I think you and Marcie
really need?

08:50.302 --> 08:52.934
A poolroom for you and me.

08:52.969 --> 08:55.234
I don't know.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.734
I think Marcie and I should
get a room we both like.

08:57.769 --> 09:01.567
She's got one.
She's got the kitchen.

09:01.602 --> 09:04.501
You need something
to fill up your life

09:04.536 --> 09:06.367
and I think this room
is the perfect thing.

09:06.402 --> 09:09.133
See, Steve, remember how great
it was when you were a kid

09:09.168 --> 09:10.667
and you had your own room,

09:10.702 --> 09:13.868
and you had the privacy
to do whatever you wanted to?

09:13.903 --> 09:16.300
You can do
those things again.

09:16.335 --> 09:18.367
I don't need
to do that anymore.

09:18.402 --> 09:20.100
I've got a wife now.

09:20.135 --> 09:21.968
And a terrific little wife
she is too.

09:22.003 --> 09:25.701
She would never stand in the way
of you wanting your poolroom.

09:25.736 --> 09:27.200
Listen, think of it, Steve.

09:27.235 --> 09:29.701
A little refrigerator
for your beer.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.200
A little powder
on your hands.

09:32.235 --> 09:34.701
That feeling
of the cue stick

09:34.736 --> 09:35.968
sliding through your fingers.

09:36.003 --> 09:37.300
That squeak of the chalk.

09:37.335 --> 09:38.734
But most of all,

09:38.769 --> 09:41.801
that feeling of adrenaline
coursing through your veins

09:41.836 --> 09:45.334
as you make that
two-cushion bank shot,

09:45.369 --> 09:47.868
8-ball in the side pocket.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:57.601 --> 09:58.934
Gee.

09:58.969 --> 10:00.901
That was a great workout.

10:00.936 --> 10:03.734
You want some pie?

10:03.769 --> 10:05.534
Sure.

10:05.569 --> 10:07.834
It really does give you
an appetite, doesn't it?

10:07.869 --> 10:11.534
Ah, the boys are at your house,
talking about your new room.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.934
So, what kind of room
is this going to be?

10:14.969 --> 10:16.667
An all-purpose room.

10:16.702 --> 10:18.133
What a waste.

10:18.168 --> 10:20.300
Why not build a room
with a purpose?

10:20.335 --> 10:23.467
Like an exercise room
for you and me.

10:23.502 --> 10:24.801
Ice cream?

10:24.836 --> 10:26.200
Sure.

10:26.235 --> 10:29.667
Gee, an exercise room
would be great.

10:29.702 --> 10:31.701
Then we wouldn't
have to wait in line

10:31.736 --> 10:32.934
to use their equipment

10:32.969 --> 10:36.767
and be laughed at
by women with good bodies.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.167
Chocolate sauce?

10:38.202 --> 10:39.767
Okay.

10:39.802 --> 10:42.200
I don't know, Peggy.

10:42.235 --> 10:45.000
Steve and I wanted a room
we could both use.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.000
Oh, Steve has
his own room.

10:47.035 --> 10:48.734
He has the kitchen.

10:48.769 --> 10:52.501
Besides, aren't you sick
of dragging me along each week

10:52.536 --> 10:54.734
to be your free guest
at the health club?

10:54.769 --> 10:57.567
I mean, they know
I'm not gonna join.

10:57.602 --> 10:59.067
Doesn't that
embarrass you?

10:59.102 --> 11:01.667
Well, not as much
as you stealing towels.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.734
Hey. That sign said:

11:03.769 --> 11:05.634
"Guest towels. Take one."

11:05.669 --> 11:08.667
Look, Marce, if you build
an exercise room,

11:08.702 --> 11:11.167
not only will you
look better,

11:11.202 --> 11:12.667
but you'll live longer.

11:12.702 --> 11:15.767
And isn't that
the best possible present

11:15.802 --> 11:17.033
you could give Steve?

11:20.167 --> 11:21.934
Whipped cream?

11:21.969 --> 11:23.234
What the heck.

11:23.269 --> 11:26.133
I'm gonna have
an exercise room, right?

11:26.168 --> 11:27.567
Right.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.334
Now, this exercise room should
have a little refrigerator

11:37.369 --> 11:39.334
for our juice
and other healthy things.

11:39.369 --> 11:43.234
Listen, honey, I think this
is a great move, adding a room.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.000
Listen, you guys,

11:45.035 --> 11:46.133
thanks for
suggesting it.

11:46.168 --> 11:47.634
What are
neighbors for?

11:47.669 --> 11:49.133
Our pleasure.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.634
Steve, let's start getting
bids from some contractors.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.868
And architects.

11:52.903 --> 11:54.767
And designers.
I want to move on this thing.

11:54.802 --> 11:56.534
I love you, Marcie.
I love you, Steve.

11:56.569 --> 11:58.033
I hate them, Peg.

11:58.068 --> 12:00.701
They hate you, Al.

12:00.736 --> 12:03.701
Yeah, but they're gonna
have a nice little room

12:03.736 --> 12:07.400
where I can go and shoot pool
and have fun.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.701
I hate to break
this to you,

12:09.736 --> 12:12.801
but that room is gonna be
an exercise room for me.

12:12.836 --> 12:15.634
Oh, and Marcie, I guess,
if she can find the time.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.033
I don't think
she will, personally.

12:17.068 --> 12:19.634
Forget it, Peg.
I'm getting a poolroom.

12:19.669 --> 12:21.534
I'm getting
an exercise room.

12:21.569 --> 12:22.767
Not a chance!

12:22.802 --> 12:24.767
Look, Marcie
is on my side.

12:24.802 --> 12:26.834
She makes the money,
she's got the power.

12:26.869 --> 12:30.501
Yeah? I make the money,
and I have no power.

12:30.536 --> 12:32.033
Why is that, Peg?

12:32.068 --> 12:33.534
Well, we'll deal
with that tomorrow.

12:33.569 --> 12:35.534
The important thing is,
I want that poolroom,

12:35.569 --> 12:37.934
and Steve's
gonna get it for me.

12:37.969 --> 12:39.601
Marcie will run
right over him

12:39.636 --> 12:41.400
like a tractor
over a road apple.

12:41.435 --> 12:42.667
Not this time, Peg.

12:42.702 --> 12:43.767
This time, he's gonna be

12:43.802 --> 12:45.100
the little road apple
that could.

12:45.135 --> 12:46.234
Ha, ha!

12:46.269 --> 12:47.767
Oh, yeah?
Call him back here

12:47.802 --> 12:49.567
and we'll settle this
once and for all.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.200
All right, fine.

12:54.601 --> 12:56.601
Steve- Oh.

12:56.636 --> 12:59.968
Excuse me.
Could you come back in?

13:02.601 --> 13:04.834
We want you
to settle an argument

13:04.869 --> 13:06.167
between me and Peg.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.133
Now, is that addition
gonna be a poolroom

13:08.168 --> 13:09.634
like Steve wants

13:09.669 --> 13:12.634
or an exercise room
like Peg wants?

13:12.669 --> 13:14.133
You want
a poolroom?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.133
You didn't say anything
about a poolroom.

13:16.168 --> 13:18.634
Well, you didn't say anything
about an exercise room.

13:18.669 --> 13:21.634
I thought we weren't gonna
make any decisions

13:21.669 --> 13:23.634
without consulting
our life partner.

13:23.669 --> 13:26.634
Well, it looks like
you made one

13:26.669 --> 13:29.033
without consulting
me, Ms. La Lanne.

13:29.068 --> 13:32.634
How do you like
my little road apple now?

13:32.669 --> 13:35.834
It ain't over until
the fat lady sings.

13:35.869 --> 13:38.167
You don't even
play pool anymore.

13:38.202 --> 13:39.534
At least I exercise.

13:39.569 --> 13:43.133
So I can be healthy
and live longer for you.

13:43.168 --> 13:45.334
Oh, Marcie.

13:45.369 --> 13:47.801
* La la **

13:47.836 --> 13:50.767
But I suppose I could
exercise at the club,

13:50.802 --> 13:53.267
rather than have you risk
injury or disease

13:53.302 --> 13:54.601
at the local pool hole.

13:54.636 --> 13:57.100
No, your body
is much more important

13:57.135 --> 13:59.601
than my having
a good time.

13:59.636 --> 14:01.601
We'll build
your exercise room.

14:01.636 --> 14:06.467
I don't want you
to be unhappy.

14:06.502 --> 14:07.834
Look, it's obvious

14:07.869 --> 14:10.601
that things are heating up
here a little bit too much.

14:10.636 --> 14:13.634
Why don't we take a minute,
relax, sit down and cool off.

14:13.669 --> 14:16.634
Now, Steve will
cool off right here.

14:16.669 --> 14:19.501
Come on, Marcie. Let's make you
a cup of coffee and calm down.

14:21.634 --> 14:23.133
How you doing, Steve?

14:23.168 --> 14:24.634
Are you comfortable?

14:24.669 --> 14:26.033
Sure, Al.

14:26.068 --> 14:29.133
How could you be
without a backbone?!

14:29.168 --> 14:30.634
You know damn well

14:30.669 --> 14:33.634
you and me wanted
this pool table.

14:33.669 --> 14:36.000
How come she's the one
racking the balls?

14:38.133 --> 14:40.968
Al, it wasn't worth
fighting about.

14:41.003 --> 14:43.067
Oh sure, our rights
are not important?

14:43.102 --> 14:46.601
Anything a woman says
is fine with us.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.601
When did men
become such losers?

14:49.636 --> 14:53.601
It used to be so great
to be a man.

14:53.636 --> 14:55.033
Women were there
to please us.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.434
They'd look after the kids

14:56.469 --> 14:59.234
and we'd go out
and have a good time.

14:59.269 --> 15:01.534
That's the natural
order of things.

15:01.569 --> 15:03.000
What happened, Steve?

15:03.035 --> 15:04.133
Well, Al-

15:04.168 --> 15:05.868
I'll tell you
what happened, Steve.

15:05.903 --> 15:09.601
Somebody told women they should
start enjoying sex too.

15:09.636 --> 15:12.601
That was the beginning
of the end.

15:12.636 --> 15:16.100
Now they like it,
but it's work for us.

15:16.135 --> 15:17.601
Everything's work for us.

15:17.636 --> 15:19.634
It's this equality thing.
It's killing us.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.200
You know who I blame?

15:21.235 --> 15:22.501
The French?

15:25.634 --> 15:28.501
I think it's this Curie guy
started the whole thing.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.133
He's the guy
that let his wife

15:30.168 --> 15:32.501
take the credit
for discovering radium.

15:32.536 --> 15:34.667
But she did
discover radium.

15:34.702 --> 15:37.634
Probably because
he left it out one night.

15:37.669 --> 15:39.634
That never would
have happened

15:39.669 --> 15:41.367
if he had his own room.

15:41.402 --> 15:42.767
Einstein had his own room.

15:42.802 --> 15:46.067
You think Einstein invented
the theory of relativity

15:46.102 --> 15:47.801
in his wife's
exercise room?

15:47.836 --> 15:50.801
No. He was in his own room
with the door closed.

15:50.836 --> 15:52.400
Now, you make
a decision, Steve.

15:52.435 --> 15:53.767
But make the right one.

15:53.802 --> 15:56.434
Remember, a man's castle
is his pants.

16:00.767 --> 16:03.934
Why is it men always
get what they want?

16:03.969 --> 16:06.434
Steve's not getting
what he wants.

16:06.469 --> 16:08.434
He will.
They always do.

16:08.469 --> 16:09.934
And we let them.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.434
You know, no matter
how far we've come,

16:12.469 --> 16:14.434
we are still subservient.

16:14.469 --> 16:16.434
It all started with Adam.

16:16.469 --> 16:18.434
You know, when he said,

16:18.469 --> 16:22.434
"Yo, Eve. Get me an apple,
would you, babe?"

16:22.469 --> 16:23.968
And she did.

16:24.003 --> 16:27.634
And now you are gonna repeat
that same mistake

16:27.669 --> 16:29.868
by giving Steve
a pool table.

16:29.903 --> 16:31.734
You can't draw
parallels there.

16:31.769 --> 16:36.467
That's like comparing
apples and pool tables.

16:36.502 --> 16:38.033
We're talking
symbols here,

16:38.068 --> 16:40.434
and what they
do to men.

16:40.469 --> 16:42.033
You see,
they start out normal,

16:42.068 --> 16:44.033
and then puberty happens.

16:44.068 --> 16:47.033
And suddenly, they're
acting like peacocks

16:47.068 --> 16:48.701
and thinking
they're Italian.

16:48.736 --> 16:51.334
You know,
a lot of people

16:51.369 --> 16:54.200
say that puberty
has to do with hormones.

16:54.235 --> 16:56.701
I blame it on poolrooms.

16:56.736 --> 16:58.734
You see, that's where
they hang out,

16:58.769 --> 17:00.734
elbow each other,
smoke cigars,

17:00.769 --> 17:04.767
and make up names
for boobs.

17:04.801 --> 17:07.666
But Steve seems
to really want this room.

17:07.702 --> 17:11.733
Yeah. Just like Al really wanted
the basement for his room.

17:11.769 --> 17:14.233
You know, that's why
we bought this dump.

17:14.269 --> 17:15.733
Because it had a basement.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.733
I wanted a sewing room.

17:17.769 --> 17:20.200
You know, someplace
I could go and drink wine

17:20.234 --> 17:22.601
and hide from the kids.

17:24.067 --> 17:26.400
Al wanted to build a boat.

17:26.435 --> 17:28.400
A boat he'll never finish.

17:28.435 --> 17:29.734
So once again,

17:29.769 --> 17:33.267
a woman gives up
her dream for a man.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.767
Don't do it, Marcie.

17:34.802 --> 17:38.267
Ruin Steve's dream now
for the both of us.

17:38.302 --> 17:41.133
I'm not sure that's
the best solution.

17:42.767 --> 17:46.767
Marcie, I didn't want
to have to tell you this,

17:46.802 --> 17:48.767
but the women
in the neighborhood

17:48.802 --> 17:50.634
really look up to you.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.000
Really?

17:52.035 --> 17:55.534
Mm. They know they
can't do what you do

17:55.569 --> 17:58.701
because they're married
to men like Al,

17:58.736 --> 18:03.567
men who look at their own
ear wax and smile with pride.

18:05.234 --> 18:07.234
But you give us hope.

18:07.269 --> 18:09.234
You and your
Susan B. Anthony-

18:09.269 --> 18:11.234
or should I say,

18:11.269 --> 18:14.033
Marcie B. Rhoades
Aerobics Studio?

18:14.068 --> 18:16.634
I had no idea.

18:16.669 --> 18:18.601
I know you didn't.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.067
You've got to do it, Marcie.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.067
Let the women look to you
and admire you,

18:24.102 --> 18:27.067
oh, except for those two women
who live in the brown house

18:27.102 --> 18:28.567
and say they're sisters.

18:28.602 --> 18:31.434
Don't let them
admire you too much.

18:33.734 --> 18:35.234
I don't know.

18:35.269 --> 18:39.200
Steve's so unselfish
and kind and sharing.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.133
Is he?

18:48.767 --> 18:51.200
Come on, Steve.
Let's go home.

18:51.235 --> 18:53.701
I think we have something
to talk about.

18:53.736 --> 18:55.200
Yes, we do.

18:55.235 --> 18:58.200
I've decided
I want a pool table.

18:58.235 --> 19:01.200
Ha! And a bag of apples
too, I suppose.

19:01.235 --> 19:04.067
I'd like to think
I can have apples if I want to.

19:09.701 --> 19:11.200
They're coming,

19:11.235 --> 19:13.234
and they've
made a decision.

19:13.269 --> 19:14.734
Here they come.

19:14.769 --> 19:17.234
Marcie's walking in front,
and she's got the plans.

19:17.269 --> 19:19.601
Yeah, but Steve's
eating an apple.

19:25.234 --> 19:27.234
Well, we've been
talking for hours,

19:27.269 --> 19:29.100
and we've reached
a decision.

19:32.567 --> 19:36.234
Well, what's it
gonna be?

19:36.269 --> 19:38.567
We decided to build

19:38.602 --> 19:41.501
an all-purpose room
for both of us.

19:41.536 --> 19:43.968
It's going to be
a sitting room

19:44.003 --> 19:45.601
where we can escape

19:45.636 --> 19:48.267
the pressures
of the living room,

19:48.302 --> 19:50.701
where we can be
alone together

19:50.736 --> 19:52.167
for uninterrupted
quality time.

19:52.202 --> 19:53.734
It's going to have
a bay window,

19:53.769 --> 19:55.634
a love seat,
and a loom.

19:55.669 --> 19:59.467
Yes, because we've always
wanted a loom with a view.

20:03.133 --> 20:04.601
I guess all that's left

20:04.636 --> 20:06.667
is for you guys
to sign the variance.

20:06.702 --> 20:09.200
Uh...I don't know.

20:09.235 --> 20:11.200
What do you think, Peg?

20:11.235 --> 20:12.701
I don't know.

20:12.736 --> 20:14.000
It's an awful lot
of digging

20:14.035 --> 20:15.701
and hammering
early in the morning.

20:15.736 --> 20:16.868
And the dust.
Oh.

20:16.903 --> 20:18.601
Yeah, I gotta be honest
with you guys,

20:18.636 --> 20:20.434
It seems like
a lot of trouble to us,

20:20.469 --> 20:22.234
and for what?

20:22.269 --> 20:24.000
You don't need
another room.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.267
I can't believe
you would entice us

20:27.302 --> 20:28.734
with a room
that we might enjoy

20:28.769 --> 20:31.234
when all you wanted was for us
to sign the variance.

20:31.269 --> 20:34.734
We don't like
to be manipulated.

20:34.769 --> 20:36.734
I feel so used.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.167
I think you two
better leave.

20:39.202 --> 20:41.734
You're the ones who said
we should build a room.

20:41.769 --> 20:43.734
Little late for
an apology now.

20:43.769 --> 20:45.234
I expected
better of you.

20:45.269 --> 20:46.734
But we ordered
a loom.

20:46.769 --> 20:48.467
That was a little presumptuous,
wasn't it, Marcie?

20:48.502 --> 20:50.100
Now just a second, Al,

20:50.135 --> 20:51.667
because I've reached
my boiling point.

20:51.702 --> 20:52.701
Easy, honey.

20:52.736 --> 20:54.200
Not this time.

20:54.235 --> 20:56.267
I listened to
your Einstein theory,

20:56.302 --> 20:58.534
I listened to your
"Man's castle is in his pants,"

20:58.569 --> 21:00.067
and I watched while your wife

21:00.102 --> 21:02.934
tried to shatter
my wife's hourglass figure.

21:02.969 --> 21:05.734
And now you are gonna hear
what I have to say.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.067
<i>Vive la France!</i>

21:13.200 --> 21:15.701
The nerve
of those two, eh?

21:15.736 --> 21:17.400
I guess I'll
have to go on

21:17.435 --> 21:20.067
being her guest
at the health club.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.334
Hey, Peg. You think
there's any room

21:26.369 --> 21:28.534
for a pool table
in our basement?

21:28.569 --> 21:30.734
Yeah, if you wanna
get rid of the boat.

21:30.769 --> 21:33.234
Oh, honey,
we can't do that.

21:33.269 --> 21:35.133
We're gonna sail
the Great Lakes

21:35.168 --> 21:37.734
on that baby someday,

21:37.769 --> 21:39.234
just you and me.

21:39.269 --> 21:41.234
The freedom of the sea.

21:41.269 --> 21:44.234
I'm gonna finish it
too, Peg.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.734
I know you will, Al.

21:45.769 --> 21:48.601
And I'm gonna
vacuum someday too.

21:50.167 --> 21:53.167
I know you will, Peg.

21:53.202 --> 21:54.968
Hey, honey...

21:55.003 --> 21:57.167
I thought of a great
name for the boat.

21:57.202 --> 21:59.567
You know what
I'm gonna call it?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.067
<i>The Al Bundy.</i>

22:04.601 --> 22:06.734
I'm think I'm gonna
go down in the basement

22:06.769 --> 22:08.067
and look at it right now.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.701
Bud, are we
in the basement?

22:17.736 --> 22:19.067
No, Mom.

22:19.102 --> 22:20.901
Then what do we do?

22:21.305 --> 22:27.466
