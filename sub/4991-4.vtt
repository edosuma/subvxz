00:05.572 --> 00:06.607
(phone dings)

00:12.279 --> 00:14.548
Julia's passing out
performance reviews
this morning.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.749
Yay!

00:15.749 --> 00:18.452
Wow. Somebody's excited
for her report card.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.187
I think of each perfect review

00:20.187 --> 00:21.488
as a step toward
a better career.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.259
And toward a car
that doesn't have
the "check engine" light on.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.760
(phone dings)

00:33.166 --> 00:34.167
Kevin!

00:36.069 --> 00:37.604
You get a gold star.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.173
Perfect performance review.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.075
The star is metaphorical,
of course.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.143
We're adults.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.579
You deserve something
more real.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.081
No, I--

00:48.081 --> 00:50.050
Don't resist.
Come on, give in. Give in.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.386
What about me?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.254
Just hugs for the boys
today, sweetheart.

00:54.254 --> 00:57.424
You and your dewy skin
and perfect beach waves

00:57.424 --> 00:59.226
did just fine.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.094
Ricky!

01:01.094 --> 01:02.529
Congratulations.

01:02.529 --> 01:05.599
You had the biggest
drop-off in scores
in the entire company.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.267
Are you firing me?

01:07.267 --> 01:08.969
I told HQ I couldn't do that,

01:08.969 --> 01:11.338
that you were
far too valuable
to this company,

01:11.338 --> 01:13.140
-not to mention
my dry-cleaning.
-Thank you.

01:13.140 --> 01:16.243
They're still working
on that bong water stain
on your tube dress, by the way.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.512
Just sign one new client
by the end of the week.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.747
And then, I can play
whatever race card you are

01:20.747 --> 01:22.149
to roll you
over the finish line.

01:22.149 --> 01:24.618
Okay, Julia. I'll do it.
I know I can.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.119
Russell!

01:28.155 --> 01:29.523
I'm going to go
pack up my stuff.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.258
What? Why?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.160
You can totally
sign one new client
by the end of the week.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.194
These are ridiculous!

01:34.194 --> 01:36.096
It says I lack
problem-solving skills.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.065
I do not lack
problem-solving skills.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.234
Guys, I think everybody
is just making too big
a deal out of these things.

01:41.234 --> 01:44.237
I mean, what does
"born leader" even mean?

01:44.237 --> 01:46.139
Yes, the natural
ability to lead.

01:46.139 --> 01:49.209
But, you see, it's just--
it's so subjective, right?

01:49.209 --> 01:52.179
"Who cares?" said
the analytical go-getter.

01:53.246 --> 01:55.282
-Yeah. See you, guys.
-Yeah. See ya.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.516
Hey!

01:56.516 --> 01:59.319
-Why don't I help you?
-You'd do that for me?

01:59.319 --> 02:02.289
-Why?
-Well, you helped me
when I first got here.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.257
Now, me with the gold star...

02:04.257 --> 02:06.360
-Who better to help you?
-It's like in the Bible.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.328
"The best shall
helpeth the worst."

02:08.328 --> 02:10.163
Hmm.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.498
Don't know that one.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.433
Oh. Maybe it's <i>Harry Potter.</i>

02:13.433 --> 02:14.468
Hmm.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.505
<i>♪ 'Cause it's all good ♪</i>

02:18.505 --> 02:21.341
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:21.341 --> 02:23.744
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:23.744 --> 02:25.545
<i>♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:27.214 --> 02:28.448
<i>♪ 'Cause it's all good ♪</i>

02:28.448 --> 02:31.051
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:31.051 --> 02:32.552
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:34.421 --> 02:36.423
So, listen, I don't think
I'm going to be able to make it

02:36.423 --> 02:39.126
to the opening of Panini Castle
this afternoon for lunch.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.395
I've, um...

02:41.395 --> 02:43.363
I've taken on
some extra work.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.265
Damn! It's a theme
restaurant, Kevin.

02:45.265 --> 02:47.167
You know when
it's a theme restaurant,
I have to be there.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.371
I know. Costumes,
meal combo puns,
disgruntled employees...

02:51.371 --> 02:53.273
It's everything
a fun meal should be.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.207
It's just...

02:55.976 --> 02:58.211
This is definitely going
to take a while.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.746
Hey, I feel you, man. Okay?

02:59.746 --> 03:01.281
I get busy, too.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.150
Weightlifting benches
just don't disinfect themselves.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.518
Thanks for understanding.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.987
Hey, but if anything changes,
call me. Okay?

03:06.987 --> 03:09.256
It's a medieval theme,
so you know there's the promise

03:09.256 --> 03:11.391
of those tight dresses
with the shoelace tops.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.060
I know how you love those.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.229
(gasps)
He's arrived!

03:16.229 --> 03:18.632
Kevin the mentor,
down from gold star mountain

03:18.632 --> 03:20.267
to bestow
his knowledge nuggets

03:20.267 --> 03:22.069
upon little lamb Ricky,
who's lost his way.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.572
(chuckles)
That's a bit dramatic,
don't you think?

03:25.572 --> 03:28.241
Although, gold star mountain is
kind of cute. Let's keep that.

03:28.241 --> 03:31.344
Now, first thing's first.
We've got to clean up
this desk, huh?

03:31.344 --> 03:33.280
Maybe tuck in that shirt.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.214
(phone dings)

03:40.420 --> 03:42.289
I didn't even realize
it was out.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.758
I used to be the guy
who put paperwork
in a file right away.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.526
Now, I put it
under a pastry.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.029
Just as fast, but still.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.997
So, what happened
to the old Ricky?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.432
I mean, what's changed?

03:52.432 --> 03:54.267
Is something going on
outside of work?

03:54.267 --> 03:55.235
Well, since you asked...

03:59.139 --> 04:01.074
I've been having
major problems
with the ladies.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.477
Oh, did you break up
with that checkout girl
from Vons?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.378
-She was cute.
-That was a while ago.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.713
When she started dating
the meat guy there.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.648
Spoiler alert.
He's called the meat guy,

04:08.648 --> 04:10.350
but he works
in the produce section.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.385
So, I was out of the race
immediately.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.387
I was talking about
my twin sister, Liz.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.290
Not usually described
as one of the ladies,
but go on.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.426
Liz never lets me
do anything on my own.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.763
She's seven minutes older,
and boy, she never lets me
forget it.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.664
"We're going to watch
the movie I want.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.633
"We're going
to cook the clams
how I want."

04:26.633 --> 04:29.136
Last night,
it was <i>Casino</i> and casino.

04:29.136 --> 04:32.672
The doctor who delivered us
said that she took up
80% of the womb,

04:32.672 --> 04:35.308
and she's been crowding me
ever since.

04:35.308 --> 04:39.579
Well, Ricky, you can't let
your issues with your sister
influence your work.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.982
-(phone rings)
-Hold on. It's my sister.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.316
Yeah?

04:43.316 --> 04:45.118
Hey, Kev, do you know
how to get to here?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.453
Get where?
From where?

04:46.453 --> 04:48.388
Well, I'm home,
but I'm leaving,

04:48.388 --> 04:50.390
and I want to make sure
I know how to get back from set.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.293
I'm planning ahead.
Zero compliments for that?
Thanks.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.295
You're a grown-up.
Figure it out.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.199
Looks like we're both having
problems with the ladies.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.004
Julia, I was wondering--

05:04.004 --> 05:05.605
-Audrey!
-Is everything okay?

05:05.605 --> 05:07.474
Oh, everything's just the best.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.342
I'm being fired,

05:09.342 --> 05:10.577
but wine still exists.

05:10.577 --> 05:13.380
Speaking of which,
I know you saw me
hide this just now,

05:13.380 --> 05:15.515
so there's no point in me
keeping it down here any longer.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.017
You're being fired?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.718
I got an email from corporate

05:18.718 --> 05:21.154
saying my review was on hold,

05:21.154 --> 05:22.389
with an interview to follow.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.124
That doesn't necessarily
mean that you--

05:24.124 --> 05:25.992
Oh, wake up, Bambi!

05:25.992 --> 05:27.627
It's bad news.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.497
Apparently, you can be
a top international seller,

05:30.497 --> 05:33.400
but they won't forgive
one unsanctioned trip
to New Zealand

05:33.400 --> 05:35.402
to visit someone you thought
was a special friend.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.138
Now, I know I need to lawyer up,
but I can't lawyer up,

05:38.138 --> 05:41.007
because I already <i>Casino</i>-ed up
and lost my 401k.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.243
It seems like
you have a problem.

05:43.243 --> 05:46.279
I can quit any time I want.
Besides, it's a breakfast wine.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.515
No, what I meant is,
it seems like
you have a problem,

05:48.515 --> 05:51.151
and I can solve it for you.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.719
My roommate's dad
is a lawyer.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.622
Mm. I'm intrigued.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.125
I'm glad you suggested
I tuck in my shirt.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.493
I thought I would
feel restricted,

06:00.493 --> 06:02.329
but, in a way,
the structure has made me free.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.031
Ooh, hey!

06:05.031 --> 06:07.100
Some of those companies
we reached out to
emailed me back.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.301
(phone dings)

06:11.371 --> 06:15.242
Look, Arcola Theaters wants
to meet at our office tomorrow
and see our presentation.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.043
If they like it,
they'll sign!

06:17.043 --> 06:19.012
Oh! That's what
I'm talking about!

06:19.012 --> 06:20.447
Tomorrow afternoon
is right around the corner.

06:20.447 --> 06:21.548
Let's get cracking.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.517
Hey!

06:24.517 --> 06:26.119
I thought that you didn't
have time for lunch.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.520
Hi, Brian. No, yeah.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.389
This is more work
than it is lunch.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.291
He's helping me get ready
for a huge presentation.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.760
Oh, fantastic!
How can I help?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.529
Graphs? Charts? Stats?
That's all I got.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.064
I said "stats," right?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.633
We're-- We're--
We're on a deadline, though.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.401
Let me tell you something
about deadlines.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.638
If I don't get ten people
to join the spin class by noon,

06:44.638 --> 06:46.306
there's no spin class.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.441
Actually, this is more
of a corporate thing,

06:48.441 --> 06:51.077
and it just has
to be Ricky and me.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.282
Oh, it's like that.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.416
Okay.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.184
No. See-- Brian! This is--

06:58.184 --> 06:59.586
This is why I didn't tell you
what I was doing.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.321
Because I didn't think
you'd understand.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.555
Oh, I understand, Kevin.

07:02.555 --> 07:03.990
You're all about the work now.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.592
Working late,
working weekends,

07:05.592 --> 07:08.461
neglecting your wife,
your child, your lawn,
and then?

07:08.461 --> 07:09.496
You die alone.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.431
You enjoy
your miserable future.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.766
Don't!

07:13.767 --> 07:16.436
Well, looks like you're
having guy problems, too.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.610
Patti?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.645
Hey, you're out of your
really fancy moisturizer.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.113
Thanks.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.415
Hey, I was wondering,

07:28.415 --> 07:30.483
does your dad ever
do any pro-bono work?

07:30.483 --> 07:32.552
Uh-oh, girl.
What did you do?

07:32.552 --> 07:34.487
Don't panic.
We'll get you out of it.
Even murder.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.489
But we'll probably have
to ship you off somewhere.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.425
Ooh, I'll miss you.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.360
-It's not for me.
-Oh.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.462
It's for my boss.
And before you say no,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.297
I kind of already promised
he would do it.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.199
Are you referring
to your insane boss?

07:46.199 --> 07:48.735
I'm not letting her
near my father.
He's a class act.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.036
Julia is classy.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.471
She has a tramp stamp
of Grace Kelly.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.173
Okay, look,

07:53.173 --> 07:54.507
my dad is really busy.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.443
They were almost going
to follow him around

07:56.443 --> 07:58.545
for a reality TV show
about busy Indian lawyers,

07:58.545 --> 08:00.447
but they went
with the Native American
version instead.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.516
But she really needs his help,

08:03.516 --> 08:05.618
and if he helps her,
that will help me.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.388
If I can solve her problem,
she'll amend my review.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.223
I thought you said
this wasn't for you.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.725
Oh.

08:11.725 --> 08:15.462
Well, it's more for
young women in business
as a whole.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.697
This review could be
my sixth perfect one in a row,

08:17.697 --> 08:20.533
and I can maybe be named
one of the "Hot 27 Under 27"

08:20.533 --> 08:22.335
in the food
and beverage industry.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.471
That is one weird goal.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.343
I don't think
this is a good idea.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.278
Ricky, you have
a confidence issue, okay?

08:32.278 --> 08:33.613
And the only way
to deal with that,

08:33.613 --> 08:35.548
is to deal with the reason
that it's so low right now.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.052
There you are!

08:39.052 --> 08:40.453
Did you get
all my voicemails?

08:40.453 --> 08:42.188
I need you to sweep
all the leaves

08:42.188 --> 08:43.423
off the trampoline
before dinner.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.558
I'm motivating
to bounce tonight.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.530
(sighs)
Liz...

08:50.530 --> 08:52.499
I feel like you don't
give me my space.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.134
We're not in utero anymore.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.536
I need my 50%.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.271
The point is,

08:58.271 --> 08:59.672
I need to be my own person,

08:59.672 --> 09:03.743
and it's time
you started giving me
the respect I deserve.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.481
Okay.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.983
Good night, buddy.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.619
I'm sorry things
didn't work out exactly
as we'd planned.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.687
But you know what?
She is the one
missing you right now.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.256
I guarantee it.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.457
Yeah, I guess.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.593
No! Leave it on.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.728
It'll keep me warm.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.030
Okay.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.565
Sweet dreams, buddy.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.500
Good night, Kevin.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.035
I really hope
I can fall asleep.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.338
(snores loudly)

09:40.513 --> 09:42.549
Oh-ho-ho! Look at you!

09:42.549 --> 09:44.751
Now, I know you probably didn't
have the best sleep last night,

09:44.751 --> 09:46.219
but it's paying off.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.654
The old Ricky
is fighting his way back.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.690
This is the kind of data
the old Ricky would wrangle.

09:50.690 --> 09:51.991
Hmm?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
I'm so fired up
for the presentation,
my head is buzzing,

09:59.599 --> 10:02.202
but that might be from sleeping
against the copier.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.336
It doesn't matter.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.604
(phone dings)

10:09.709 --> 10:11.511
What?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.079
When did this happen?

10:14.414 --> 10:15.715
(sighs)

10:15.715 --> 10:18.151
Damn it.
Kevin never brought me
that phone charger.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.728
Redial.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.332
-Hello?
-Hi, who's this?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.500
And can you come over
and help me?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.604
(line ringing)

10:37.604 --> 10:38.738
Brian: <i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

10:38.738 --> 10:42.008
So, you went with Roxie
to the opening
of the Panini Castle.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.376
I'm still here,

10:43.376 --> 10:44.544
and I might just stay

10:44.544 --> 10:46.546
because they're having
a horse here from 2:00 to 4:00.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.614
No rides though.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.682
But why...

10:49.682 --> 10:51.284
why are you hanging out
with my sister?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.520
Oh, because we're not
corporate drones like you.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.721
We're out here living life.

10:54.721 --> 10:57.190
Maybe you don't know,
but your sister just moved here.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.259
-Yeah! Yeah, Kev.
-Yeah, Kev.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.195
Oh! I had no idea.
Maybe that's why
I'm sleeping in a crib.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.596
I would love to chat some more,

11:03.596 --> 11:05.732
but, uh, we're fueling up
for a big day.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.368
<i>We're going to Koreatown,</i>
<i>the Grove,</i>

11:08.368 --> 11:09.736
Malibu.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.304
Ooh, Brian,
the horse is here.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.573
Oh! We're going to go
have fun, Kev.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.309
You enjoy working,
worker man. Ha.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.711
Look at that!

11:18.711 --> 11:20.380
With the saddle.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.981
Oh, we're going to see
about "no rides."

11:21.981 --> 11:23.183
(horse whinnies)

11:23.183 --> 11:25.451
A horse?

11:27.487 --> 11:28.688
Audrey: Knock, knock!

11:28.688 --> 11:31.424
Julia, the lawyer
I was telling you about
is here.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.760
Oh! Oh, no!

11:33.760 --> 11:35.395
My four ounces of halibut.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.996
Oh, well.
Good thing I'm still full

11:36.996 --> 11:39.132
from the six pecans I had
two hours ago.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.267
Samir Kapoor.
Nice to meet you.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.670
-I'm here to help.
-I'm here to be helped,

11:43.670 --> 11:45.572
helper man
from another land.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.640
-(chuckles)
-Okay, I will leave you two.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.310
If there are any more
problems that arise
that need solving,

11:50.310 --> 11:52.745
or if you want to talk
about, you know, amending
my performance review,

11:52.745 --> 11:54.080
you know where to find me.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.985
Oh, that's a huge... briefcase.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.689
Okay.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.657
Hours away
from the presentation.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.259
-How are you feeling?
-So good.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.994
I haven't called
my sister once.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.396
I thought I would've begged her
to take me back by now.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.732
It's still not
sounding quite right
for sister talk, buddy.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.200
You've really
inspired me, Kevin.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.668
We make a great team.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.204
In fact, I came up with
a power couple name for us.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.006
-"Rickin."
-"Rickin."

12:20.006 --> 12:21.241
Who's going to close that deal?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.209
Frickin' Rickin is going
to close that deal!

12:23.209 --> 12:25.178
-That's right.
-Pound and then blow it.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.046
-Blow it.
-(phone dings)

12:27.046 --> 12:28.648
Oh, come on. This again?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.450
-(phone dings)
-Stop it.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.452
-(phone dings)
-Okay, you know what?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.620
This is getting ridiculous.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.288
Ricky, pick up
that pie chart.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.390
I'm going to show them
we're having fun.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.658
Ha!

12:38.658 --> 12:41.327
"Work rocks!" Send.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.597
I shouldn't have sent that.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.466
-Yeah, that was pretty lame.
-(sighs)

12:50.336 --> 12:53.039
I tried to time that
so I'd be in the reflection
when you closed it.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.274
I misjudged.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.210
Everything okay?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.511
Oh, yeah!

12:58.511 --> 13:00.546
Aside from you tearing
my family apart.

13:01.681 --> 13:04.250
Daddy, it's me!

13:04.250 --> 13:06.519
Ready for dinner on you.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.054
Daddy?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.622
(giggles)
Dinner?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.624
We're still on breakfast.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.762
(screams)

13:15.762 --> 13:17.430
-Oh, my God!
-Exactly.ú

13:18.698 --> 13:21.200
Okay, not an ideal scene
to come home to,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.069
but what's the harm, really?

13:23.069 --> 13:24.337
Aren't your parents divorced?

13:24.337 --> 13:26.005
Only for 12 years, though.

13:26.005 --> 13:29.342
And hasn't your dad
ever had a girlfriend
in those 12 years?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.010
Yes, of course.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.046
But, for some strange reason,
after I meet them,

13:33.046 --> 13:34.480
they decide
never ever to return.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.216
Besides, there's still hope for
my parents to get back together

13:37.216 --> 13:39.118
as soon as I find
my British twin.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.386
Look...

13:40.386 --> 13:44.724
your dad and Julia obviously had
a very instant connection.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.626
Don't you want your dad
to be happy?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.328
Is it really the worst thing?

13:50.730 --> 13:53.766
Yes! I do believe it is!

13:53.766 --> 13:57.537
But I will think about allowing
this abomination to continue.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.642
And I'll try and get
that image out of my head,

14:02.642 --> 14:05.378
and the love for syrup
back into my heart.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.385
Okay.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.753
-Breathe in.
-Okay.

14:13.753 --> 14:17.123
Visualize sweat-free lip,
face, neck, pits, and back.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.091
And breathe out.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.461
Okay, I think I got this.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.762
(phone dings)

14:22.762 --> 14:26.032
(scoffs)
This is still happening.
Can you believe it?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.067
Like I care
that you're shopping.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.502
Oh! They went to Brookfields.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.003
I got Liz
an eye mask there

14:31.003 --> 14:32.472
that says,
"Professional Snoozer."

14:33.673 --> 14:35.608
She's even got him
holding her bags.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.744
And her purse.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.223
(sighs)
The phone charger.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.527
He's not living, he's working,
and he doesn't even know it.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.131
Kevin, I'm going to need
the backup shirt.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.167
That is the backup shirt.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.069
No...

15:08.474 --> 15:11.577
Come on, Brian.
Pick up, you big, trusting--

15:11.577 --> 15:13.079
Hello?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.114
Roxie, what are you doing
answering Brian's phone?

15:15.114 --> 15:17.216
If you had read
any of my jillions
of text messages,

15:17.216 --> 15:19.752
you would know
that my phone ran out of charge
so I borrowed his.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.021
Come on,
that was hours ago.
Where is he now?

15:22.021 --> 15:24.290
Last time I saw him,
he was on his way
to stand in line

15:24.290 --> 15:25.725
and wait for
the limited edition

15:25.725 --> 15:27.627
pink Swarovski Signature
Smartwatch for me,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.128
because he wanted to.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.097
Oh, come on.
You're just using him.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.298
You're pretending
he's your friend.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.067
Um, I am his friend
and I'm using him.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.436
Those two are not
mutually exclusive.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.271
-Man: We're back.
-Ooh, I gotta go.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.139
<i>Do you have fruit leather?</i>

15:40.139 --> 15:42.341
I'm ready to be
back on top, Kevin.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.110
Frickin' Rickin is going
to nail this one!

15:44.110 --> 15:46.179
Great! Call me
as soon as it's over.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.548
Wait! Where are you going?
You can't leave now.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.117
I'll be just Frickin' Rick.
Who's going to sign
a deal with him?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.453
Now, you listen to me.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.087
When I first took you
under my wing,

15:55.087 --> 15:56.489
you were a complete disaster,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.090
your desk was, like, a buffet,

15:58.090 --> 16:00.293
you were living
under the tyranny
of your sister.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.761
But that was two days ago.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.996
You're a completely
different person now.

16:03.996 --> 16:06.632
Not Rick and not Rickin,

16:06.632 --> 16:08.034
but Ricky.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.603
But that's who I always was.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.338
Yes, exactly.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.739
You've always been Ricky.

16:13.739 --> 16:18.244
You just had to help him
find his way...

16:18.244 --> 16:19.545
here.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.516
You're the best
in the business, Kevin.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.152
That speech
only you understand
proves that.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.587
That speech was terrible.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.589
Liz, what are you doing here?

16:29.589 --> 16:31.224
I feel like "terrible"
is a little harsh.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.124
You should go.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.727
I can help my brother
better than anyone,

16:34.727 --> 16:37.330
and if anyone's going to be part
of a power couple with him,

16:37.330 --> 16:38.631
it's me.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.267
-We could be called "Licky"!
-(gasps) "Licky"!

16:41.267 --> 16:44.203
You guys really
can't help crossing that
brother-sister line, can you?

16:44.203 --> 16:45.404
Good luck, you two.

16:45.404 --> 16:48.674
I figured you already
saturated "A" shirt
and "B" shirt,

16:48.674 --> 16:50.209
so I brought you this.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.478
I don't know
what to say, Liz.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.213
I don't want
to need you anymore,

16:54.213 --> 16:55.681
but I could sure use "C" shirt.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.383
I'm sorry!

16:57.383 --> 16:59.519
I know we can't always
be together 24/7,

16:59.519 --> 17:01.287
like we were in Mom,

17:01.287 --> 17:03.089
but I have trouble letting go.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.725
You're the one
who left me in there.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.560
It was my time.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.428
And now, it's yours.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.265
Okay.

17:13.399 --> 17:16.502
So, the figures are clear
and the choice is obvious.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.504
The Arcola Theater Group
demands the best

17:18.504 --> 17:20.573
and Superior is just that.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.576
I'm so proud of you.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.111
Questions?

17:25.111 --> 17:26.679
I like you.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.285
Patti, what are you doing here?

17:32.285 --> 17:35.154
Well, I've done
some soul-searching
about my dad and Julia.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.990
-Good.
-And I've decided to kill her.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.559
Please, please.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.127
I'm this close to getting
corporate off her back
because of your dad.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.762
Then I'll be the one
that solved everything--

17:42.762 --> 17:44.297
Oh, my God!

17:44.297 --> 17:45.765
Is that still
what this is about?

17:45.765 --> 17:48.734
Solving a problem
so you can climb
the corporate ladder?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.269
Well, guess what.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.437
You're not a problem-solver.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.706
You're a problem-maker.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.475
I thought we were friends,
but you've made it clear
what's more important to you.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.277
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:58.277 --> 17:59.679
I've got a skull to bash.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.314
Wait. You're right.

18:01.314 --> 18:04.984
I should have known better
than to introduce Julia
to a man with working genitals

18:04.984 --> 18:06.552
and expect her
to keep it professional.

18:06.552 --> 18:09.288
Are we really talking
about my dad's genitals
in this apology?

18:09.288 --> 18:11.023
I messed up, okay?

18:11.023 --> 18:12.558
It was selfish of me
to try to use your dad

18:12.558 --> 18:14.360
to boost
my stupid score review,

18:14.360 --> 18:16.062
and I'm sorry.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.998
But your dad has been
divorced from your mom

18:18.998 --> 18:20.666
for a long time, you know?

18:22.268 --> 18:24.403
It still hurts though.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.072
I thought they would
always be together.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.441
I think this is a problem
I know how to fix.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.744
It's pretty obvious
what's going on here.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.348
Julia, I think Patti is afraid
that you're going to try
to replace her mother.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.616
Now, let me stop you
right there.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.320
Patti, honey, I don't want
to be your mother.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.390
Ech! I want to be better
than your mother.

18:44.390 --> 18:47.727
I want to be a mom
you can go clubbing with
and call your BFF

18:47.727 --> 18:49.161
and borrow each other's outfits

18:49.161 --> 18:51.297
regardless
of age appropriateness.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.199
-I don't think that's quite--
-Really?

18:53.199 --> 18:54.533
-Real--? Okay.
-And maybe one day,

18:54.533 --> 18:57.503
we can flash our boobs
off the balcony at Mardi Gras,

18:57.503 --> 19:00.640
find someone to carry around
our tiny purse dogs,
and go to rehab together.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.208
What do you say?

19:02.208 --> 19:04.744
So, you just really want
to be the Dina Lohan
to my Lindsay?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.278
I would love that.

19:06.278 --> 19:09.215
Can you come over this weekend?
I need to get to know you
immediately.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.384
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm already
hanging out with someone else
on the weekend.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.485
Tom Collins!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.286
Ah! I'll bring
my girl Margarita.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.088
I hope they get along.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.624
You should join us, too.
We need to thank you
for bringing us together.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.493
Both: Yes, mama!

19:25.031 --> 19:26.165
Brian!

19:27.266 --> 19:29.068
Brian...

19:29.068 --> 19:30.336
Roxie's been using you.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.271
Oh, that's sad, Kevin.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.540
You see that your sister and I
are having a great time,
and you're jealous.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.108
Is that what this is about?

19:36.108 --> 19:38.310
Name me one thing
that you have done
with my sister

19:38.310 --> 19:39.345
that wasn't an errand for her.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.148
You shuttled her
all around town,

19:42.148 --> 19:44.283
you picked up
her dry cleaning,

19:44.283 --> 19:46.218
you held her purse!

19:47.386 --> 19:49.288
Oh, my God.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.157
I picked up
her birth control, Kevin.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.159
You didn't.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.227
You're not ready
to be an uncle, are you?

19:56.295 --> 19:58.097
(sighs)
How'd I let this happen?

19:58.097 --> 19:59.565
It's not your fault, man.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.567
-I should have seen this coming.
-No, it's on me.

20:01.567 --> 20:05.071
A man carrying a little--
a little yellow clutch.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.406
That's not right.

20:07.406 --> 20:11.377
I guess maybe I just
wanted to feel needed.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.147
I'm sorry. I got so caught up
with my gold star review

20:15.147 --> 20:16.382
and trying to fix Ricky.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.417
I totally neglected you, man.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.986
What do you say
we get out of this line

20:20.986 --> 20:23.255
and let Roxie do something
on her own for once?

20:23.255 --> 20:25.057
We can hit up Panini Castle
on the way.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.292
Yeah!

20:27.359 --> 20:29.662
-I'm not even going
to bring her the watch.
-Attaboy.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.498
I'm not going to bring
her birth control either.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.300
Let's maybe just bring her
that one last thing.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.534
-She doesn't need it.
-No, she does, though.

20:35.534 --> 20:36.602
-No, she doesn't.
-No.
