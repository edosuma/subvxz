<i>Ten of</i> <i>the best tattoo artiss</i>

00:03.570 --> 00:07.006
<i>on the planet are competing</i>

00:07.741 --> 00:08.942
[shouts]

00:09.008 --> 00:11.311
[narrator] <i> On the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Ink Master <i> ,</i>

00:11.378 --> 00:13.913
<i>six artists were left</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

00:13.980 --> 00:15.181
[Dave] <i> Each week</i>
<i>we've been testing you</i>

00:15.248 --> 00:16.282
<i>on the essential skills</i>

00:16.349 --> 00:18.051
<i>needed to become</i> <i>an</i> Ink Mastr
<i>.</i>

00:18.118 --> 00:20.120
This week,
these are your canvases.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.590
{\an1}[man] I'm a shark attack
survivor.

00:23.656 --> 00:26.025
I had to actually fight
the shark to get away.

00:26.092 --> 00:28.561
[Lea] Oh, my God.
This is intense.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.997
I hope I'm not gonna
[bleep] it up.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.799
[narrator]
<i>The artists'</i> <i>color skills</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:35.335
<i>were put to the test</i>
<i>in the Flash Challenge.</i>

00:35.402 --> 00:37.704
[Dave] The one artist we feel
won this challenge--

00:37.771 --> 00:39.005
Shane.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.774
[Josh] I'm definitely
pissed off.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.342
<i>They're not gonna</i>
<i>rip Shane apart,</i>

00:42.409 --> 00:44.010
no matter if he takes
a [bleep] on his leg

00:44.077 --> 00:45.979
or if he does a great tattoo.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.747
[Josh] I don't know
what the [bleep] else I can do.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.884
[narrator]
<i>In the elimination tattoo,</i>

00:50.950 --> 00:53.653
<i>Josh proved his color skills</i>
<i>are top notch.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:54.954
[man] That's [bleep] nice.

00:55.021 --> 00:58.258
[narrator] <i> And Bili's cockiness</i>
<i>became a problem.</i>

00:58.324 --> 01:00.493
Any time I do a clock,
I put it on the same time.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.295
It's the time I was born.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.063
That's pretty egotistical

01:04.129 --> 01:06.433
to put the time of your birth
into someone else's tattoo.

01:06.499 --> 01:08.501
I'd say pack your [bleep]
after you finish that tattoo.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.771
[bleep] it, I am egotistical.
I don't give a [bleep].

01:13.907 --> 01:15.308
[narrator] <i> At the elimination,</i>

01:15.375 --> 01:17.911
<i>Bili and Lea</i>
<i>were the bottom two</i> .

01:17.977 --> 01:19.045
[Dave] Bili.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.146
[Chris] <i> There's</i>
<i>no traditional tattoo</i>

01:20.213 --> 01:21.481
<i>that has opaque gray on a wing.</i>

01:21.548 --> 01:22.515
[Bili] That's straight brown.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.083
Whatever it is,
it's straight wrong.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.885
It's a traditional tattoo
that has balls,

01:25.952 --> 01:27.253
and you cut the balls off.

01:28.655 --> 01:29.656
[Dave] Lea.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.824
[Chris] <i> The whole composition</i>

01:30.890 --> 01:33.193
of this tattoo is just painful
for me.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.228
This has been
the toughest deliberation

01:35.295 --> 01:37.530
that we've been faced with yet.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.032
Bili, you do not have
what it takes

01:39.098 --> 01:40.733
to be <i> Ink Master.</i>

01:40.800 --> 01:41.968
This just [bleep] blows.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.538
[narrator] <i> Five artists remain,</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:49.609
<i>but only one will earn</i>
<i>a $100,000 prize</i>

01:49.676 --> 01:52.078
<i>and the title</i> <i>of Ink Master.</i>

01:52.145 --> 01:56.349
[rock music]

02:37.557 --> 02:39.492
[Tommy] Oh, that's a surprise.

02:39.559 --> 02:42.929
[Shane] Oh, slick.
Lucked out again.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.064
{\an5}-[Tommy] How'd it go, guys?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.064
-It was horrible.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.799
I can't believe
I'm here, because Bili

02:46.866 --> 02:49.102
is so [bleep] good.

02:49.168 --> 02:51.604
[Josh] <i> Lea definitely</i>
<i>had her worst going today.</i>

02:51.671 --> 02:53.339
{\an8}I feel like she's
on the hot seat.

02:53.406 --> 02:54.841
[Josh] That's good news for me.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.744
Bili was such a good tattooist
that it's good he's gone.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.212
There's no traditional tattoo

02:59.279 --> 03:00.380
that has opaque gray in a wing.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.115
{\an5}-[Bili] That's brown.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.115
-[Chris] That's brown?

03:02.181 --> 03:03.383
That's brown.
That's straight brown.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.884
Whatever it is,
it's straight wrong.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.786
<i>If it wasn't meeting</i>
<i>the criteria,</i>

03:06.853 --> 03:08.187
it wasn't a traditional tattoo,

03:08.254 --> 03:09.389
and that's the bottom line.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.024
Well, I mean,
I learned my lesson

03:11.090 --> 03:12.425
in this one, believe me.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.928
I wish I could have done
something smaller.

03:14.994 --> 03:16.429
You tell him. It's not up to him

03:16.496 --> 03:18.164
to tell you how much
you can work.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.899
[Chris] <i> The whole composition</i>
<i>of this tattoo</i>

03:19.966 --> 03:21.267
is just painful for me.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.836
[Lea] <i> I feel relieved</i>
<i>that I just made it through.</i>

03:23.903 --> 03:25.638
{\an8}I felt like I was gonna go.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.607
<i>I'm really afraid</i>
<i>for the next challenge.</i>

03:27.674 --> 03:30.743
My next client,
I'm not gonna let them, like,

03:30.810 --> 03:32.245
run my [bleep] show.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.813
[Josh] Just explain it to 'em.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.715
"You get a free tattoo
out of this deal.

03:35.782 --> 03:38.451
"I could possibly go home
or win $100,000,

03:38.518 --> 03:39.786
so you're gonna work with me."

03:39.852 --> 03:42.155
They signed up to get
a tattoo for free.

03:42.221 --> 03:44.257
[bleep] huge five-hour tattoo.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.425
You don't come on

03:45.491 --> 03:47.560
and screw with somebody's
chances and dictate.

03:47.627 --> 03:49.228
[Josh] I'm glad I made it
another day.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.597
{\an5}-Getting real.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.597
-Yeah.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.184
[James] <i> So we're in a church.</i>

04:11.250 --> 04:13.820
{\an8}What in the world
am I doing in a church?

04:13.886 --> 04:15.555
[Josh] <i> It's appropriate</i>
<i>we're in a church today.</i>

04:15.622 --> 04:19.492
{\an8}I'm praying
that my stuff turns out well.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.928
{\an8}I'm not a big fan
of being inside churches.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.129
<i>There's not really</i>
<i>any rhyme or reason</i>

04:23.196 --> 04:24.464
<i>why I bug out when I'm in here.</i>

04:24.530 --> 04:26.466
<i>I just start feeling</i>
<i>light-headed, a little strange.</i>

04:27.667 --> 04:29.102
Welcome
to another Flash Challenge.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.037
As always, you'll be judged
by Oliver Peck,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.839
Chris Nunez, and myself.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.274
Plus, we have
a very special guest judge.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.211
NBA fans will tell you
he's known as much

04:38.277 --> 04:41.080
for his shot-blocking ability
as he is for his tattoos.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.416
From the Denver Nuggets,
Birdman.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.822
<i>I'm Chris Andersen</i>
<i>of the Denver Nuggets,</i>

04:49.889 --> 04:51.557
{\an8}better known as the Birdman.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.359
<i>Very well known</i>
<i>for blocking shots,</i>

04:53.426 --> 04:55.528
<i>rebounding,</i>
<i>and getting the crowd hyped.</i>

04:55.595 --> 04:57.530
<i>I'm electrifying,</i> <i>I'm crazy,</i>

04:57.597 --> 05:00.299
<i>I'm also well-known</i>
<i>for my very colorful tattoos.</i>

05:00.366 --> 05:02.402
{\an5}-[Dave] What's up, dude?

05:00.366 --> 05:02.402
-You know, same old, same old.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.270
Tell us a little bit
about the work you got here.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.371
I like to keep the consistency.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.106
<i>The way everything</i>
<i>was put together,</i>

05:07.173 --> 05:08.174
<i>the shading,</i> <i>the coloring--</i>

05:08.241 --> 05:09.442
can't stop getting tatted up.

05:12.111 --> 05:13.746
Alright, guys,
this week we're testing

05:13.813 --> 05:15.014
your proportion skills.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.684
{\an8}Proportion is when
all the elements

05:17.750 --> 05:19.285
{\an8}in a composition work together

05:19.352 --> 05:20.620
{\an8}and are balanced in size.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.622
{\an8}<i>If you don't have correct</i>
<i>proportion in a tattoo,</i>

05:22.689 --> 05:23.990
it's just gonna look
like [bleep].

05:24.057 --> 05:26.993
Perfect example
is Josh's photorealism tattoo.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.163
<i>He ended up in the bottom three</i>
<i>because his proportion was off.</i>

05:30.229 --> 05:31.798
{\an8}Just let it go, man.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.166
<i>It was a great tattoo.</i>

05:33.232 --> 05:36.035
Just leave my fruit out of it
and get off my ass.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.870
In order to test
your proportion,

05:37.937 --> 05:40.139
you will be sketching one
of the most iconic symbols

05:40.206 --> 05:41.507
in the art world,

05:41.574 --> 05:42.442
the praying hands.

05:43.242 --> 05:46.112
{\an8}Oh, no, this sucks.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.514
<i>I haven't done that</i>
<i>in a long, long time.</i>

05:48.581 --> 05:49.982
Hands are one
of the hardest subjects

05:50.049 --> 05:51.350
to master proportionally.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.885
{\an8}I've struggled
with praying hands

05:52.952 --> 05:54.754
<i>since I started tattooing.</i>

05:54.821 --> 05:57.090
<i>That is the number-one tattoo</i>

05:57.156 --> 05:59.592
<i>that I just have never</i>
<i>been able to do.</i>

05:59.659 --> 06:01.994
I am not looking forward
to any of this.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.332
You'll have 45 minutes
to draw the praying hands.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.434
Your time starts now.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.739
{\an8}Drawing hands is one
of the most difficult things.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.640
<i>It's a weakness</i>
<i>that a lot of artists have.</i>

06:14.707 --> 06:16.576
<i>They have to get</i>
<i>the proportions right</i>

06:16.642 --> 06:18.177
<i>or the hands</i> <i>look un-lifelik.</i>

06:19.579 --> 06:20.646
{\an8}I can't decide

06:20.713 --> 06:22.281
<i>which angle</i>
<i>I want to draw this from,</i>

06:22.348 --> 06:24.183
so I'm kind of freaking
out a little bit,

06:24.250 --> 06:26.586
<i>because I'm drawing from two</i>
<i>different angles at one time.</i>

06:26.652 --> 06:28.955
<i>So I'm seeing one thing,</i>
<i>and I'm drawing another.</i>

06:30.323 --> 06:32.692
{\an8}I just need to get this whole
church thing out of my head.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.460
<i>I don't know what the [bleep]</i>
<i>the problem is.</i>

06:34.527 --> 06:36.028
<i>As soon as I pick up the pencil,</i>

06:36.095 --> 06:37.497
<i>things start going haywire,</i>

06:37.563 --> 06:38.998
<i>and it's not coming out</i>
<i>the way I want.</i>

06:39.899 --> 06:41.100
{\an8}For the American traditional,

06:41.167 --> 06:43.136
<i>I got a hard critique</i>
<i>on the way my hand was.</i>

06:43.202 --> 06:44.804
<i>So I'm gonna try</i>
<i>to really show them</i>

06:44.871 --> 06:46.139
<i>that I can illustrate</i>
<i>a hand right.</i>

06:48.508 --> 06:50.743
[Chris] <i> Hands are very tricky.</i>
<i>Proportion is everything.</i>

06:50.810 --> 06:52.712
<i>Fingers have to be</i>
<i>the right length.</i>

06:52.779 --> 06:54.247
<i>The width of the hand</i>
<i>has to be right.</i>

06:54.313 --> 06:56.849
{\an8}There's so many different
complex things.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.918
<i>If just one little element</i>
<i>is off,</i>

06:58.985 --> 07:00.720
the hand looks horrible.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.221
[Josh] Pencils suck.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.290
[Josh] <i> I'm sweating.</i>
<i>I'm so uncomfortable in here.</i>

07:04.357 --> 07:05.992
{\an8}I'm stressed out
as it is with it.

07:06.058 --> 07:07.994
<i>I notice Lea</i>
<i>stressing hard over it.</i>

07:08.060 --> 07:10.196
<i>She doesn't even have</i>
<i>any shading or anything</i>

07:10.263 --> 07:11.130
<i>in her drawing.</i>

07:12.732 --> 07:14.167
[Lea] <i> This is definitely</i>
<i>a lot tougher</i>

07:14.233 --> 07:15.735
<i>than I thought it was gonna be.</i>

07:15.802 --> 07:17.904
{\an8}I don't want to find
myself in the hot seat again.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.373
[Dave] One more minute.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.313
Alright, that's it.
Time's up.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.247
Pencils down.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.918
{\an8}Thank God this
is just a sketching challenge.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.353
{\an8}We're not putting anything
on bodies today.

07:34.420 --> 07:35.788
You guys all happy
with your sketches?

07:35.855 --> 07:37.423
{\an8}-Yup.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.423
{\an8}-I'm not feeling confident

07:37.490 --> 07:38.591
{\an8}about winning this challenge.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.059
<i>I caught a glance</i>
<i>over at Tommy's.</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:41.761
<i>He just has a lot more</i>
<i>dark shading in there</i>

07:41.828 --> 07:43.396
<i>so it gives it some depth.</i>

07:43.462 --> 07:45.331
The Flash Challenge
hasn't ended yet.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.101
Inside your shop, you'll find

07:49.168 --> 07:51.537
a randomly selected canvas.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.874
Your job is to tattoo
your sketch on the canvas.

07:55.708 --> 07:56.809
[Josh] <i> Holy [bleep].</i>

07:56.876 --> 07:58.945
{\an8}This day is just awful.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.613
[Lea] <i> I don't have the shading</i>
<i>on my hands.</i>

08:00.680 --> 08:01.948
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

08:02.014 --> 08:04.450
{\an8}Now I have
to tattoo those hands.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.485
{\an5}-[bleep].

08:04.517 --> 08:06.485
-You have 90 minutes

08:06.552 --> 08:08.054
to do this tattoo.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.188
[Shane] <i> I'm psyched.</i>

08:09.255 --> 08:11.090
{\an8}I get to redeem myself,
redeem my drawing,

08:11.157 --> 08:13.459
<i>'cause I can make up the shading</i>
<i>in my head in the tattoo.</i>

08:13.526 --> 08:15.494
Good luck and head to your shop.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.868
{\an8}Today, this challenge
has much higher stakes.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.670
<i>I hope that everybody got</i>
<i>all the little shading</i>

08:24.737 --> 08:26.405
in the back of the hands
and the fingers,

08:26.472 --> 08:28.241
<i>because this is gonna be</i>
<i>their reference material</i>

08:28.307 --> 08:30.176
for the tattoos, so, good God,

08:30.243 --> 08:31.644
I'm praying for our clients.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.380
That how big you're doing it?

08:34.447 --> 08:35.280
[Tommy] Yeah, maybe
they should be

08:35.347 --> 08:36.215
a little smaller actually.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.316
What are they, infants' hands?

08:37.383 --> 08:38.818
Thought you were gonna
go bigger than that.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.852
{\an5}-Toughen up, dude.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.852
-[Tommy] Don't even look.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.256
[Dave] You got 90 minutes
to complete your work.

08:44.490 --> 08:48.027
And your time begins now.

08:49.795 --> 08:50.730
[Tommy] We had no idea

08:50.796 --> 08:52.298
we were gonna do
tattoos with this.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.299
[man] Oh, yeah?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.433
[Tommy] So I put 150 percent
into it.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.002
<i>Because of everyone</i>
<i>not realizing</i>

08:56.068 --> 08:57.336
{\an8}where this challenge
was gonna go,

08:57.403 --> 08:59.705
<i>Lea and Josh's drawings</i>
<i>were a little less detailed,</i>

08:59.772 --> 09:00.907
<i>so it's going to be</i>
<i>hard for them</i>

09:00.973 --> 09:02.775
to get a decent tattoo
out of that.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.111
[Josh] <i> Using my sketch</i>
<i>as a stencil to tattoo on</i>

09:05.177 --> 09:06.212
{\an8}is just killing me.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.682
[Josh] [bleep] bastard.

09:09.749 --> 09:10.917
[Josh] <i> I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>right now.</i>

09:10.983 --> 09:12.652
I lose part of my stencil,

09:12.718 --> 09:13.986
<i>making his thumb look nubby.</i>

09:14.053 --> 09:15.488
<i>I'm struggling.</i>

09:15.554 --> 09:16.856
[Josh] This is un-[bleep] real.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.626
{\an8}I know what the hell
needs to be in a hand

09:20.693 --> 09:22.762
<i>like, all the veins</i>
<i>in the back side of the hands.</i>

09:22.828 --> 09:24.397
<i>I'm feeling pretty damn good</i>

09:24.463 --> 09:25.498
<i>about this part</i>
<i>of the challenge.</i>

09:25.564 --> 09:27.800
I turned a drawing
into a nice tattoo,

09:27.867 --> 09:29.368
<i>and I'm not sure</i>
<i>that the other competitors</i>

09:29.435 --> 09:30.770
<i>are gonna do that.</i>

09:30.836 --> 09:32.972
Like a photograph.
That's beautiful.

09:33.039 --> 09:33.906
[Shane] Yeah.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.977
{\an8}I gotta tattoo the hands I drew.

09:38.044 --> 09:39.979
<i>I really wish I would have got</i>
<i>the shading down</i>

09:40.046 --> 09:41.814
<i>because now I'm not gonna have</i>

09:41.881 --> 09:43.983
the veins and all
the cool little details

09:44.050 --> 09:45.151
in those hands.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.322
Thirty seconds.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.757
[tattoo guns buzzing]

09:56.996 --> 09:59.231
Time's up.
No more tattooing.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.166
Do you like it?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.736
[man] That's beautiful.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.638
[Shane] <i> It doesn't matter</i>
<i>how good Tommy's sketch was,</i>

10:05.705 --> 10:06.906
<i>'cause, when it comes</i>
<i>to tattooing,</i>

10:06.973 --> 10:08.908
{\an8}my skills are gonna surpass his.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.509
<i>I'm here</i>
<i>to take this competition.</i>

10:11.978 --> 10:13.980
[Dave] Lea,
let's take a look at this.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.481
You did all the back
of the hands and everything

10:15.548 --> 10:16.716
{\an5}-just from memory?

10:15.548 --> 10:16.716
-[Lea] Yeah.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.918
<i>I had no shading in my drawing.</i>

10:18.985 --> 10:20.619
<i>You actually used the tendons</i>

10:20.686 --> 10:21.988
in the back of the hand,
opposed to using,

10:22.054 --> 10:23.255
<i>like, the veins.</i>

10:23.322 --> 10:25.257
[Chris] <i> It's, like,</i>
<i>a non-traditional take</i>

10:25.324 --> 10:26.792
<i>on praying hands.</i>

10:26.859 --> 10:27.893
I knew it.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.596
{\an8}What is missing in my hands
is the veins

10:30.663 --> 10:32.365
<i>because I didn't have</i>
<i>the shading in place.</i>

10:32.431 --> 10:33.933
<i>Another Flash Challenge</i>

10:34.000 --> 10:35.668
that I'm not gonna get.

10:35.735 --> 10:36.802
[Dave] Tommy?

10:36.869 --> 10:39.472
That looks almost identical
to the statue.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.674
<i>Tremendous detail.</i>
<i>Fingernails.</i>

10:41.741 --> 10:43.576
<i>I mean, even the grooves</i>
<i>in the knuckles.</i>

10:43.642 --> 10:45.311
[Oliver] I think you got
the proportion right,

10:45.378 --> 10:46.278
which is the main test here.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.247
Making up for my hand yesterday.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.083
[Oliver] You used a light source
from this cross.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.585
That's what makes it
go together so well.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.120
Yeah, I was trying
to pull it together.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.388
<i>Tommy's sketch</i>
<i>looked much better</i>

10:55.454 --> 10:56.822
{\an8}than his actual tattoo.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.791
<i>The tattoo looks dark,</i>
<i>irritated.</i>

10:58.858 --> 11:00.026
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>it's not gonna heal smooth.</i>

11:01.594 --> 11:02.661
[Dave] James.

11:02.728 --> 11:03.829
It looks like you got
a little more detail

11:03.896 --> 11:05.698
in your tattoo
than you did in your drawing.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.733
[James] I was able to refine
a little bit.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.902
[Chris] <i> I like that you were</i>
<i>not scared to do dark.</i>

11:09.969 --> 11:11.404
<i>That's got a lot of black.</i>

11:11.470 --> 11:12.605
You went in,
and you put the dark

11:12.671 --> 11:13.806
where the dark should be.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.375
[Dave] What's happening, Josh?

11:16.442 --> 11:18.044
How detailed was your sketch?

11:18.110 --> 11:19.345
[Josh] <i> Pretty detailed.</i>

11:19.412 --> 11:20.546
<i>I tried to simplify it</i>
<i>more on here</i>

11:20.613 --> 11:22.114
<i>than this actual sketch was.</i>

11:22.181 --> 11:23.849
[Chris] <i> It definitely has</i>
<i>a different style.</i>

11:23.916 --> 11:27.753
He just shaded on the outsides
of it and on the bottom

11:27.820 --> 11:28.654
and around it.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.122
I like the use of heavy black

11:30.189 --> 11:32.024
<i>in the background,</i>
<i>gives it that dimension.</i>

11:32.091 --> 11:33.359
You know, that's
an original drawing Josh did

11:33.426 --> 11:35.795
{\an5}-this morning.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.795
-Excellent. I love it.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.663
{\an8}The proportions
on Josh's hands were way off.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.932
<i>His hands came out</i>
<i>a little cartoony.</i>

11:39.999 --> 11:41.267
It was kind of wonky looking.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.168
[Dave] Shane.

11:42.234 --> 11:44.503
You chose the right angle.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.971
<i>A lot of times,</i>
<i>people do it too sideways</i>

11:46.038 --> 11:47.339
<i>and you can't see both thumbs</i>

11:47.406 --> 11:49.575
<i>and the depth</i>
<i>in between the fingers.</i>

11:49.642 --> 11:51.444
I was kind of worried
when I saw you drawing it

11:51.510 --> 11:52.778
actually on the sketchpad,

11:52.845 --> 11:53.813
<i>and from what I see,</i>

11:53.879 --> 11:55.448
<i>the difference,</i>
<i>it blows me away.</i>

11:55.514 --> 11:57.683
<i>I mean, I like how it's open</i>
<i>and the angle of it.</i>

11:57.750 --> 11:58.951
<i>You can actually</i>
<i>see inside of it.</i>

11:59.018 --> 12:00.853
Really good job.
I like it.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.054
[Tommy] <i> Shane's hands came out</i>
<i>way chubbier</i>

12:02.121 --> 12:03.722
<i>than the actual sculpture.</i>

12:03.789 --> 12:05.491
{\an8}I'm totally psyched.
I think I have a chance now.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.261
{\an8}[Lea] You like it?

12:09.328 --> 12:10.830
{\an8}I wanted it on my calf.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.531
[Lea] It's not gonna be good.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.366
I don't really want to go
above my knee.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.302
[Lea] He's ready to go home.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.437
If you don't want to do it,
that's fine.

12:18.504 --> 12:19.638
This is not going to be good.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.415
Alright, guys.
So this is a tough one.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.718
The hands in the church
were a little bent like that.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.221
But I noticed that Lea's fingers
were sort of like...

12:35.287 --> 12:37.156
{\an5}-Yeah.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.156
-That, like, straight.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.824
[Oliver] <i> It's the angle</i>
<i>she picked.</i>

12:38.891 --> 12:41.927
I think that, if there
was a bottom pair of hands,

12:41.994 --> 12:44.196
<i>I think Josh's was a little</i>
<i>out of proportion.</i>

12:44.263 --> 12:45.364
<i>The nails were a little tiny.</i>

12:45.431 --> 12:47.433
It was pudgy.
Josh's was out of proportion.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.135
It's tough to say that
in front of his client.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.269
{\an5}-Right.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.269
{\an1}-Yeah.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.237
[Dave] <i> Shane's was</i>
<i>a little pudgy too.</i>

12:52.371 --> 12:54.440
Shane's looked
actually realistic.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.041
They looked
like these poor little guys.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.676
I think Tommy's were the best.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.612
<i>The only thing I think</i>
<i>about Tommy's is that,</i>

12:59.678 --> 13:01.013
<i>if he either changed</i>
<i>the angle of it</i>

13:01.080 --> 13:02.281
<i>on the arm a little bit,</i>

13:02.348 --> 13:03.816
it would have fit up
in that spot a little better.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.284
[Chris] James did good
on the black shading.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.253
<i>I liked the fact</i>
<i>that people go in</i>

13:07.319 --> 13:08.954
<i>with a heavier black,</i>
<i>'cause that means</i>

13:09.021 --> 13:10.055
<i>they mean what they're doing.</i>

13:10.122 --> 13:11.190
They're not hoping it works out.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.958
{\an5}-Yeah.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.958
-Like, it has to work out.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.594
So that's a little more sign
of a confident tattooer.

13:15.661 --> 13:16.662
Alright, guys.
You want to do it?

13:16.729 --> 13:18.364
{\an5}-Yes, let's do it.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.364
-Alright, cool.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.265
[Dave] So for this challenge,

13:19.331 --> 13:20.799
we tested your proportion skills

13:20.866 --> 13:23.102
by tattooing
one of the most iconic images

13:23.169 --> 13:24.870
in the world, the praying hands.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.138
We saw some
that we really liked.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.007
Saw some
that could use some work.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.644
I think that, Lea,

13:31.710 --> 13:33.345
<i>you got the grooves</i>

13:31.710 --> 13:33.345
<i>for the middle knuckles,</i>

13:33.412 --> 13:35.214
<i>but then you had nothing</i>
<i>in the next digit.</i>

13:35.281 --> 13:36.415
I wanted to see the veins.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.783
<i>To me, praying hands</i>
<i>without veins</i>

13:37.850 --> 13:39.018
<i>are a little too new school.</i>

13:40.286 --> 13:41.620
Josh, you kind of lost it

13:41.687 --> 13:42.821
<i>on the proportion of the hands.</i>

13:42.888 --> 13:44.156
<i>I think the length of the hand</i>

13:44.223 --> 13:46.192
<i>from the knuckle to the wrist</i>
<i>was a little stumpy.</i>

13:46.258 --> 13:47.526
You didn't look confident enough

13:47.593 --> 13:48.861
to step out
of your comfort zone.

13:48.928 --> 13:49.828
It's a big deal.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.467
There is one artist
that stood out.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.274
And today that artist was Tommy.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.275
Congratulations, man.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.778
{\an5}-[applause]

14:03.342 --> 14:05.778
-[Dave] Nice job, Tommy.

14:05.844 --> 14:08.080
<i>You really came back on</i>
<i>the whole hand proportion thing</i>

14:08.147 --> 14:09.481
{\an5}<i>-from last week.</i>

14:08.147 --> 14:09.481
- I did.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.749
[Dave] You have first choice

14:10.816 --> 14:11.917
of the human canvases

14:11.984 --> 14:13.352
for this week's
elimination tattoo.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.987
Awesome.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.288
[James] <i> I don't think</i>
<i>Tommy should have won.</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:17.923
<i>I did a really good</i>
<i>set of hands.</i>

14:17.990 --> 14:20.192
{\an8}And I thought I had a little bit
more dimension in mine.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.627
You guys did a life drawing.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.996
This is the first time we've
thrown this curve ball at you.

14:24.063 --> 14:25.631
This is what it means
to be in this competition.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.865
Everything's gonna get harder,

14:26.932 --> 14:28.167
and you don't know
what's coming.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.435
[Dave] Head on back
to the brownstone.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.203
Get ready
for the elimination tattoo.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.371
[Shane] <i> I'm pissed off.</i>

14:32.438 --> 14:34.206
{\an8}I feel I should have won
that Flash Challenge.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.641
<i>Tommy's making a run for it.</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:37.610
I'm just gonna have to teach him
a lesson this next challenge.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.116
[Tommy] I can't even try
to imagine

14:44.183 --> 14:45.317
what the [bleep] is coming up,

14:45.384 --> 14:47.253
because I think
we always try to imagine

14:47.319 --> 14:48.754
what the next thing was, and...

14:48.821 --> 14:50.022
You're stressing out about it.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.523
[Tommy] I'm nervous,
you know, like...

14:51.590 --> 14:53.659
[Shane] <i> Tommy's the one I need</i>
<i>to watch out for.</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:55.394
{\an8}I see that he can do
some tight detail.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.763
<i>Now I got to sweat him.</i>
<i>I mean, I'm here to win.</i>

14:57.830 --> 14:59.698
[Shane] Well, you could always
just go home, dude.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.300
Oh, strategically.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.636
[Tommy] Shane's got it
all mapped out in his brain.

15:03.702 --> 15:06.839
[Shane] I'm just glad
I see a crack in Tommy's wall.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.774
[Tommy] <i> Shane's been riding high</i>
<i>in this competition,</i>

15:08.841 --> 15:10.843
{\an8}but I'm about to catch up,
and I'm gonna kick his ass.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.053
[Dave] This week,

15:21.120 --> 15:22.721
we've been testing
your proportion skills.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.423
For tonight's
elimination tattoo,

15:24.490 --> 15:25.624
you'll be designing a piece

15:25.691 --> 15:27.960
that contains
three of my favorite elements--

15:28.027 --> 15:29.194
large breasts,

15:29.261 --> 15:31.230
thin waist, and wide hips.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.232
I'm talking about pinup girls.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.601
[Tommy] <i> Pinups in tattooing</i>
<i>originated with the military,</i>

15:35.668 --> 15:38.003
{\an8}so the pinups were always
exaggerated women,

15:38.070 --> 15:39.872
<i>because the men were off at war</i>

15:39.938 --> 15:42.641
<i>and they would want to see a</i>
<i>woman with exaggerated features.</i>

15:42.708 --> 15:45.477
[Dave] Pinup tattoos require you
to take your proportion skills

15:45.544 --> 15:47.379
and turn them inside out.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.815
Pinup girls are intentionally
out of proportion.

15:49.882 --> 15:50.883
{\an8}[James] <i> I don't like</i>
<i>doing pinups</i>

15:50.949 --> 15:52.851
{\an8}because most people want
to get 'em small,

15:52.918 --> 15:55.254
{\an8}and that way you can't
get any detail in it,

15:55.321 --> 15:56.588
<i>and it could go wrong fast.</i>

15:56.655 --> 15:58.257
You are to design a pinup girl

15:58.324 --> 15:59.925
for your human canvas.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.394
The pinup must be
from head to toe.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.362
Let's meet your canvases.

16:08.367 --> 16:12.304
[Dave] Santo would like a pinup
in a firefighter's uniform.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.473
Nikki wants a pinup of herself.

16:14.540 --> 16:18.010
Bill would like
a brunette burlesque girl.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.479
Becky here would like
a 1940s style

16:20.546 --> 16:22.981
with a pecan pie or a peach.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.516
And finally we have David.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.419
David wants a pinup
of an ex-girlfriend.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.021
Ex-girlfriend.
Really, David?

16:29.088 --> 16:30.489
{\an5}-Absolutely.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.489
-[Dave] Interesting.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.859
Alright, Tommy,
you won the Flash Challenge.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.794
You get first pick
of the human canvases.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.231
[Tommy] <i> Pinups, I don't</i>
<i>really do 'em all the time.</i>

16:39.298 --> 16:40.666
{\an8}Like every other challenge,
I don't necessarily do

16:40.733 --> 16:42.167
{\an8}everything all the time.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.236
<i>I don't necessarily</i>
<i>have a forte.</i>

16:44.303 --> 16:45.871
<i>Since pinups</i>
<i>are a little difficult</i>

16:45.938 --> 16:47.239
<i>and you got to get</i>
<i>that face perfect,</i>

16:47.306 --> 16:48.707
<i>it's gonna be</i>
<i>a challenge for me.</i>

16:48.774 --> 16:51.009
[Tommy] And you were thinking
of a pinup with...

16:51.076 --> 16:52.711
[Bill]
A brunette burlesque girl.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.847
Okay, and where were you
thinking of putting it?

16:54.913 --> 16:56.014
{\an5}-[Bill] Anywhere on the...

16:54.913 --> 16:56.014
-[both] Forearm.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.719
I'm gonna go with him.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.354
[Tommy] <i> I think that's</i>
<i>the best one</i> <i>because it has</i>

17:02.421 --> 17:04.123
<i>a lot of drama to it</i>
<i>with all the feathers</i>

17:04.189 --> 17:06.058
and all of her jewelry
and her clothing.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.893
So I think I can have
a pretty good time with this

17:07.960 --> 17:09.962
<i>and make it a beautiful tattoo.</i>

17:10.028 --> 17:11.096
If I was Tommy,
I'm not sure

17:11.163 --> 17:12.263
{\an8}that, that's who I
would have picked

17:12.330 --> 17:13.531
{\an8}the guy's skin
was a little bit darker

17:13.598 --> 17:15.166
than I'd rather work on.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.769
<i>But the style of pinup</i>
<i>that he wanted</i>

17:16.835 --> 17:18.436
<i>really caters to Tommy.</i>

17:18.503 --> 17:21.205
<i>I mean, there's a good chance</i>
<i>that Tommy could win this.</i>

17:21.272 --> 17:23.375
The rest of the human canvases
will, one-by-one,

17:23.442 --> 17:25.010
pick up a skull
that has your name on it.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.779
The canvas that picks
your name is your client.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.948
Lea.

17:30.015 --> 17:32.418
{\an8}I love doing pinups.
I love doing sexy women.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.887
<i>It's one of the things</i>
<i>I specialize in,</i>

17:34.953 --> 17:36.288
<i>so I'm excited about this one.</i>

17:36.355 --> 17:37.222
Shane.

17:38.624 --> 17:39.491
James.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.828
Josh.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.329
[Dave] Alright, you have
the rest of the evening

17:44.396 --> 17:46.698
to talk with your human canvas
and come up with a design.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.768
Tomorrow, you'll have five hours
to do this tattoo.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.804
Good luck.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.540
{\an8}Tattoos of pinup girls
are one of the most commonly

17:54.606 --> 17:56.675
{\an8}requested tattoos
done in tattoo shops today.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.710
<i>Proportions</i>
<i>are really important to pinups</i>

17:58.777 --> 18:00.846
<i>because it needs to</i>
<i>look believable.</i>

18:00.913 --> 18:02.247
You can toy with it
one way or another,

18:02.314 --> 18:04.683
but it still has to
be pleasing to the eye.

18:06.952 --> 18:10.289
{\an8}So my client wants
a pinup of his ex-girlfriend.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.458
It wasn't my idea
for her to be an ex.

18:12.524 --> 18:15.093
It's something
that was a really big impact.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.062
<i>He was only with her</i>
<i>for six months,</i>

18:17.129 --> 18:20.032
and they've been broken up
for two and a half years.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.401
<i>That is very weird.</i>

18:22.468 --> 18:25.337
I originally had this idea of,
like, a cowgirl mermaid.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.072
Would love to do,
like, bell-bottoms

18:27.139 --> 18:30.442
on the bottom of her jeans
that fan out like a fin,

18:30.509 --> 18:33.412
and then the top have,
like, the Daisy Duke top,

18:33.479 --> 18:35.914
and then, like,
the cowgirl, uh, cowboy hat,

18:35.981 --> 18:37.883
and then, like, maybe,
like, a pistol.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.485
If you could do
seaweed intermittent with,

18:39.551 --> 18:41.320
like, stalks of corn.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.888
I don't think my client realizes

18:42.955 --> 18:45.023
that this is a timed tattoo.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.692
<i>This guy is probably</i>
<i>gonna get me eliminated.</i>

18:48.560 --> 18:49.895
[Lea] You want to put it
on your leg?

18:49.962 --> 18:53.699
{\an5}-[Santo] Yeah.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.699
-[Lea] Your legs are not flat.

18:53.765 --> 18:55.868
It's not gonna look good.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.503
[Lea] <i> In order to do</i>
<i>a beautiful pinup,</i>

18:57.569 --> 18:59.605
<i>the skin is really important.</i>

18:59.671 --> 19:02.407
{\an8}I like the skin to be flat
so the pinup is not distorted

19:02.474 --> 19:03.842
{\an8}when you see it.

19:03.909 --> 19:06.044
[Lea] I could do, like,
something nice right here.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.681
[Santo] That's...
That's not really what...

19:09.748 --> 19:11.917
Not really what I was,
you know, looking for.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.720
[Lea] <i> He really wants to get</i>
<i>the tattoo on his calf.</i>

19:14.786 --> 19:17.890
<i>Frankly, if Santo</i>
<i>came to see me at home,</i>

19:17.956 --> 19:19.491
I would refuse to do that.

19:19.558 --> 19:20.893
[Santo] I really wanted to
show it.

19:21.627 --> 19:22.728
Yeah, but I want to do

19:22.794 --> 19:24.496
the best work on you,
you know what I mean?

19:24.563 --> 19:28.000
But I definitely like
displaying what I get, you know?

19:28.066 --> 19:29.668
<i>I am stuck in the same situation</i>

19:29.735 --> 19:32.371
{\an8}that I was stuck earlier
during the competition.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.673
<i>This is not good.</i>
<i>I am not excited about this.</i>

19:42.748 --> 19:44.483
So Shane, what are you
gonna do when you go home?

19:46.084 --> 19:47.653
[laughs]

19:47.719 --> 19:49.421
Happy to go home
to folding laundry?

19:49.488 --> 19:52.257
{\an5}-You do your own laundry?

19:49.488 --> 19:52.257
-[Shane] Since I was 11.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.426
How do you find time
to do your own laundry?

19:54.493 --> 19:56.361
I never stop working, dude.

19:56.428 --> 19:57.596
That's why this show's
a piece of cake.

19:58.597 --> 19:59.731
A pi-- this is a piece of cake?

19:59.798 --> 20:01.533
{\an5}-Oh, [bleep].

19:59.798 --> 20:01.533
-[laughs]

20:01.600 --> 20:04.202
[Tommy] It's on like that, man.
Game face.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.238
[Shane] <i> I'm not going home</i>
<i>anytime soon.</i>

20:06.305 --> 20:07.573
<i>Tommy's always a threat.</i>

20:07.639 --> 20:09.775
He's good.
He's really freaking good.

20:09.841 --> 20:12.778
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>what he has in his arsenal.</i>

20:12.844 --> 20:14.012
Yeah, I'm having
a great time, dude.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.014
This is [bleep].
This is no stress, no sweat.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.683
{\an5}-Nothing.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.683
-Yeah, dude.

20:17.749 --> 20:18.984
<i>Everyone knew that Shane</i>

20:19.051 --> 20:20.919
was the person to keep
an eye on from the beginning.

20:20.986 --> 20:22.521
<i>Back in the game,</i>
<i>and I am gonna give Shane</i>

20:22.588 --> 20:23.622
<i>a run for his money.</i>

20:27.392 --> 20:28.660
Good morning, everybody.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.796
It's time for you all to
tap into your proportion skills

20:30.862 --> 20:33.465
and tattoo a pinup girl
on your human canvas.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.634
You'll be judged on
the proportion of your pinup.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.736
You have five hours
to complete your tattoo.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.672
The clocks starts now.

20:43.141 --> 20:45.544
Oh, my God.
That's perfect, dude.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.380
{\an8}Great pinup tattoos
consist of beautiful features

20:48.447 --> 20:50.882
<i>from the hair to the toes.</i>

20:50.949 --> 20:54.052
<i>The artist's main job here</i>
<i>is to play with proportion.</i>

20:54.119 --> 20:56.521
<i>If you don't do</i>
<i>the exaggeration the right way,</i>

20:56.588 --> 20:58.056
<i>it's going to be obviously off.</i>

21:00.058 --> 21:01.393
{\an5}-[Santo] It looks awesome.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.393
-[Lea] You like it?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.794
{\an5}-[Santo] Yeah, yeah.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.794
-[Lea] Awesome.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.096
I love her face.

21:04.162 --> 21:05.664
[Lea] The only thing is

21:05.731 --> 21:07.532
I think it's going to
look way better right here.

21:08.634 --> 21:10.936
You know?
And she's going to be super-hot.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.138
If you just change the spot,

21:13.205 --> 21:16.642
I guarantee you
it's going to be so awesome.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.311
You know, I'm just very...
I wanted it on my calf.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.647
[Lea] <i> He's stubborn.</i>

21:21.713 --> 21:24.216
{\an8}He does not understand
how important it is

21:24.282 --> 21:27.152
{\an8}to follow an artist's advice.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.420
I mean, you can't...
you can't work with

21:28.487 --> 21:29.655
the whole back of my leg?

21:32.791 --> 21:36.194
[tattoo guns buzzing]

21:36.261 --> 21:37.696
{\an8}[Shane] <i> To do a good pinup,</i>

21:37.763 --> 21:39.998
{\an8}you gotta do the face,
the expression, great.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.768
<i>And normally, I'll start at</i>
<i>the bottom and work my way up,</i>

21:42.834 --> 21:44.603
<i>but here there is</i>
<i>time constraints,</i>

21:44.670 --> 21:45.871
<i>so I went right to the head.</i>

21:45.937 --> 21:47.773
<i>Get the face exactly</i>
<i>how I wanted it to look,</i>

21:47.839 --> 21:49.508
<i>like, really tight detail.</i>

21:49.574 --> 21:51.076
I'd rather get the face done

21:51.143 --> 21:52.644
while we're crashing,
not stressing

21:52.711 --> 21:54.279
about it the last half-hour,
you know what I mean?

21:54.346 --> 21:55.814
[Shane] The judges want
a full-body pinup

21:55.881 --> 21:57.049
from head to toe,

21:57.115 --> 21:58.250
so that's gonna mean
that the faces are gonna be

21:58.316 --> 22:00.919
a lot smaller than some
of the other competitors

22:00.986 --> 22:01.853
<i>are used to doing.</i>

22:05.724 --> 22:07.292
[Tommy] <i> I'm getting</i>
<i>into the tattoo,</i>

22:07.359 --> 22:08.794
{\an8}and I'm realizing
it's very small

22:08.860 --> 22:10.962
{\an8}and I'm gonna have to put
a lot of detail into this.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.998
<i>The face is tiny,</i>
<i>so I'm a little concerned</i>

22:13.065 --> 22:15.067
<i>about getting those details</i>
<i>into the face.</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:19.938
[Lea] For me, it's--

22:20.005 --> 22:21.940
it's a shame, you know, because,
like, I really want to do

22:22.007 --> 22:25.243
my best work on you,
and this kind of design,

22:25.310 --> 22:30.482
it's gonna look the best here,
you know what I mean?

22:30.549 --> 22:35.220
And your legs are, like,
so muscled that it's not smooth.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.788
With that being said,

22:36.855 --> 22:39.057
I... I don't really
want to go above my knee.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.262
Being that you guys are the--
the top in the country,

22:44.329 --> 22:46.998
I wanted this to be displayed
at any given moment

22:47.065 --> 22:49.835
that I wanted it to be,
so people can see it.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.036
If you don't
want to do it there,

22:51.103 --> 22:52.904
I mean, that's fine.
I mean...

22:54.940 --> 22:55.974
[Lea] <i> He's willing to go home.</i>

22:56.041 --> 23:00.112
{\an8}Either I do
Santo's tattoo on his calf,

23:00.178 --> 23:02.681
<i>or I do not do any tattoo today.</i>

23:02.748 --> 23:05.217
[Lea] Well,
that's really a shame.

23:05.283 --> 23:06.518
This is bull[bleep].

23:06.585 --> 23:08.220
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

23:08.286 --> 23:09.921
[Lea] I hope I'm not
going to be sent home.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.692
Alright, guys.
That's one hour down,

23:13.759 --> 23:14.993
four hours to go.

23:16.194 --> 23:18.897
[tattoo guns buzzing]

23:20.365 --> 23:22.834
{\an8}I've done a lot
of details in this tattoo.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.469
<i>I'm a little exhausted, tired.</i>

23:24.536 --> 23:27.005
<i>This competition has been</i>
<i>mentally challenging.</i>

23:27.072 --> 23:28.607
<i>We're working on limited sleep.</i>

23:28.673 --> 23:30.742
I'm ready to finish this
and prove myself.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.312
{\an8}I'm definitely
realizing that I might have

23:34.379 --> 23:37.082
<i>went a little bizarre</i>
<i>with the cartoon images.</i>

23:37.149 --> 23:38.416
[Shane] <i> New-school again?</i>

23:38.483 --> 23:40.519
{\an8}Josh rolled with what
he feels comfortable with.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.020
Are you crazy, dude?

23:42.087 --> 23:44.756
[Shane] <i> I feel like the judges</i>
<i>are gonna rip him apart on that.</i>

23:46.491 --> 23:48.293
I know the judges
hate new school.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.995
Big, crazy tat.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.897
[Josh] <i> They're not</i>
<i>into that style.</i>

23:51.963 --> 23:54.866
<i>I'm taking the big chance,</i>
<i>showing what I love to do.</i>

23:54.933 --> 23:56.902
{\an5}-Does it look like her?

23:54.933 --> 23:56.902
-Yeah.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.870
{\an8}Josh is doing his style.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.907
{\an8}He is trying to show us
that he has his own thing.

24:01.973 --> 24:04.376
<i>And, on one end,</i>
<i>we can appreciate that,</i>

24:04.442 --> 24:05.777
<i>but on the other end,</i>
<i>you would think</i>

24:05.844 --> 24:07.012
<i>he would've learned by now</i>

24:07.078 --> 24:09.014
what these judges like
and what they don't like.

24:13.718 --> 24:15.320
[Santo] I'm just happy
that you're putting it there

24:15.387 --> 24:17.789
'cause I really was against
going anywhere else.

24:17.856 --> 24:20.959
[Lea] I love those boots.
It makes her look like a fetish.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.494
[Santo] Are these gloves
that she has on?

24:22.561 --> 24:24.029
{\an5}-[Lea] No, no.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.029
-[Santo] Oh, no?

24:24.095 --> 24:25.831
[Lea] I mean, I can put gloves
on her if you want.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.632
I think the gloves
would do a little bit something

24:27.699 --> 24:29.267
{\an5}-like that too, you know?

24:27.699 --> 24:29.267
-[Lea] Yeah, yeah.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.202
I think it's gonna look cool.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.672
[Tommy] Beautiful, man.

24:33.738 --> 24:34.940
[Tommy] <i> Lea's piece looks</i>
<i>a little off.</i>

24:35.006 --> 24:36.441
{\an8}Her proportions
were off and, like,

24:36.508 --> 24:38.510
<i>the way things</i>
<i>bent on the human body.</i>

24:38.577 --> 24:40.045
<i>She, uh, didn't really</i>
<i>tackle the job well.</i>

24:40.111 --> 24:42.113
{\an5}-[Lea] Tommy, are you done?

24:40.111 --> 24:42.113
-[Tommy] No, no, no, no.

24:42.681 --> 24:43.548
I wish!

24:45.250 --> 24:46.551
[Tommy]
<i>In this particular tattoo,</i>

24:46.618 --> 24:47.853
<i>the face is tiny.</i>

24:47.919 --> 24:49.988
And you never want to
overwork the skin in a tattoo,

24:50.055 --> 24:52.624
and you could overwork it
by doing too much detail.

24:52.691 --> 24:55.493
<i>So I'm trying to get the detail</i>
<i>in quick and get out of there</i>

24:55.560 --> 24:56.895
<i>'cause I don't want to</i>
<i>tear up the skin.</i>

24:56.962 --> 24:58.129
<i>It is a challenging one for me</i>

24:58.196 --> 24:59.397
<i>to get this thing to look right.</i>

24:59.464 --> 25:00.832
Oh, geez.

25:00.899 --> 25:01.766
I like it.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.736
I like the feathers too.

25:04.803 --> 25:05.971
Of course,
you know I'm gonna like it

25:06.037 --> 25:08.540
{\an5}-'cause of the feathers.

25:06.037 --> 25:08.540
-[Tommy] Oh, there you go.

25:08.607 --> 25:11.343
Okay, that's 30 minutes left,
everybody.

25:11.409 --> 25:13.678
[tattoo guns buzzing]

25:16.481 --> 25:18.283
{\an8}Pinup tattoos
are supposed to be seductive.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.118
{\an8}They're supposed to be enticing.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.786
<i>It's like a conversation piece.</i>

25:21.853 --> 25:23.021
<i>Men love beautiful women</i>

25:23.088 --> 25:25.257
<i>and women love</i>
<i>beautiful women in art.</i>

25:25.323 --> 25:27.692
So that's not happening
out here today.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.361
<i>Really ugly women</i>
<i>are happening out there--</i>

25:29.427 --> 25:30.328
right now.

25:30.395 --> 25:31.429
One minute to go.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.833
[tattoo guns buzzing]

25:38.970 --> 25:40.305
[Dave] Thirty seconds left!

25:44.409 --> 25:45.243
Five...

25:45.310 --> 25:46.177
Four...

25:46.778 --> 25:47.846
Three...

25:47.913 --> 25:49.114
Two...

25:49.180 --> 25:50.482
One.

25:50.548 --> 25:51.383
Okay, that's it.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.351
Time's up. Machines down.

25:53.418 --> 25:54.319
No more tattooing.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.523
[Josh] <i> I'm stoked,</i>
<i>it's finished.</i>

25:58.590 --> 26:00.158
<i>It's saturated, clean.</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:02.360
They're gonna have a hard time
trying to eliminate me.

26:02.427 --> 26:03.561
Come to this side.

26:03.628 --> 26:04.829
[Shane] <i> I'm excited.</i>
<i>I kind of took a gamble</i>

26:04.896 --> 26:06.464
doing the pinup
a little bit bigger

26:06.531 --> 26:09.734
<i>than I think was safe to do</i>
<i>in this time management,</i>

26:09.801 --> 26:12.504
<i>but I got it done</i>
<i>and I'm really happy with it.</i>

26:12.570 --> 26:14.572
{\an5}-Is it really done?

26:12.570 --> 26:14.572
-[James] Yeah.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.775
[James] <i> I'm feeling pretty</i>
<i>confident about my pinup,</i>

26:16.841 --> 26:19.411
<i>especially after seeing Lea's.</i>
<i>Lea's had a crazy arm on it.</i>

26:19.477 --> 26:20.812
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what happened to her stencil,</i>

26:20.879 --> 26:22.781
whether it rubbed off
or something, but it's--

26:22.847 --> 26:24.983
I feel a little
more confident now.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.085
[Lea] <i> I love the tattoo.</i>
<i>I think it's a beautiful tattoo.</i>

26:27.152 --> 26:29.154
<i>I don't how</i>
<i>it's gonna compare to</i>

26:29.220 --> 26:31.856
all the other
great artists here.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.793
<i>'Cause today at</i> Ink Master,
<i>we are five left.</i>

26:34.859 --> 26:35.961
<i>One is gonna go home.</i>

26:38.296 --> 26:39.631
{\an8}What happened here?

26:39.698 --> 26:41.866
{\an8}Uh, you ask that
like it was a negative thing.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.768
For real,
this is a mistake, man.

26:43.835 --> 26:45.837
I figured I didn't...
I didn't [bleep] it up too bad.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.572
[Dave] I... this is...

26:47.639 --> 26:48.873
a... a disaster.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.385
What'd you think of Lea's piece?

27:00.452 --> 27:02.420
{\an5}-[exhales]

27:00.452 --> 27:02.420
-I didn't like it at all.

27:02.487 --> 27:04.255
It's so different from what
I thought she was gonna do.

27:04.322 --> 27:05.991
[Tommy] I thought she was gonna
pull it together.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.792
At least what I saw,
I was, like, "Whoa.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.995
"Holy [bleep]."
That guy's not gonna be happy.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.363
[Shane] I think
she just cracked.

27:11.429 --> 27:12.530
I think she's going home, man.

27:12.597 --> 27:14.766
Yeah.
I'm happy about it.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.901
[Shane] There ain't no
easy way out in pinup anyways.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.037
You either can do it
or you can't.

27:19.104 --> 27:20.872
All I know
is I'm not going home.

27:20.939 --> 27:22.273
I'm dying to [bleep] win, dude.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.560
[Dave] Welcome
to tonight's elimination.

27:42.627 --> 27:44.396
Only five of you left.

27:44.462 --> 27:45.663
And this week, you were tested

27:45.730 --> 27:48.199
on your proportion skills
by tattooing a pinup girl.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.303
Tommy, you're up first.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.108
What happened here?

27:57.175 --> 27:59.477
Uh, you ask that
like it was a negative thing.

27:59.544 --> 28:01.046
I'm asking what happened.

28:01.112 --> 28:02.714
[Tommy] <i> He came looking</i>
<i>for a burlesque girl,</i>

28:02.781 --> 28:05.383
<i>and I didn't go</i>
<i>for a totally realistic piece</i>

28:05.450 --> 28:07.485
<i>because I wouldn't have</i>
<i>been able to pull it off.</i>

28:07.552 --> 28:08.787
[Dave] The face, to me,

28:08.853 --> 28:10.755
<i>she looks like she's</i>
<i>just been in a prize fight.</i>

28:10.822 --> 28:12.991
It's so tiny, man,
to work in there, you know?

28:13.058 --> 28:16.027
I think it's
a pretty standard-sized face

28:16.094 --> 28:18.530
for your average
pinup girl tattoo.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.899
<i>But, man, the eyes?</i>
<i>They're wonky, man.</i>

28:20.965 --> 28:22.901
<i>And the lips</i>
<i>just look like a smear.</i>

28:22.967 --> 28:24.402
<i>If you can outline</i>
<i>those little pearls,</i>

28:24.469 --> 28:26.504
<i>you can put an outline</i>
<i>on those lips and nose</i>

28:26.571 --> 28:27.705
and put them in the right spot.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.108
Are you okay?

28:31.109 --> 28:32.744
'Cause this
doesn't seem like you.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.779
[Tommy] Now I'm not.
I'm actually here sweating now.

28:36.114 --> 28:37.115
You've been solid,

28:37.182 --> 28:38.416
but this wasn't you today.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.018
I guess I fell short.

28:40.085 --> 28:42.587
And my other
main issue is the hand.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.956
<i>The hand is just, like,</i>
<i>very strange.</i>

28:45.023 --> 28:46.658
[Tommy] <i> It's supposed to be</i>
<i>under the gown a little bit.</i>

28:46.724 --> 28:48.460
{\an5}<i>-Like, 'cause it's suppo--</i>

28:46.724 --> 28:48.460
<i>-It's under there a little bit.</i>

28:48.526 --> 28:50.995
It'd be better if it was
under there a little more.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.730
A few areas just kind of
killed it for me.

29:02.807 --> 29:03.675
[Dave] Lea.

29:07.445 --> 29:10.482
You had a tough week last week,
it was a close call for you.

29:10.548 --> 29:13.384
{\an5}-How you feeling about this?

29:10.548 --> 29:13.384
-I feel good about it.

29:13.451 --> 29:16.688
[Dave] <i> To me, pinups</i>
<i>are stunningly gorgeous,</i>

29:16.754 --> 29:17.856
<i>and this one isn't.</i>

29:17.922 --> 29:20.525
I... this is...
a... a disaster.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.162
[Chris] The elbow
on her left arm.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.530
<i>It doesn't look right</i>
<i>with the angle.</i>

29:25.597 --> 29:27.966
<i>She doesn't have her arm</i>
<i>twisted the correct way,</i>

29:28.032 --> 29:30.068
and it doesn't
look proportionate.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.970
[Oliver] I cannot believe

29:32.036 --> 29:34.939
no one has mentioned
her left hand yet.

29:35.006 --> 29:36.441
<i>Jesus.</i>

29:36.508 --> 29:38.576
<i>It looks like she just pulled</i>
<i>it out of the garbage disposal.</i>

29:38.643 --> 29:39.911
Am I crazy?

29:39.978 --> 29:41.679
[stammering] If I... had...

29:41.746 --> 29:43.448
{\an5}-A little bit more time to--

29:41.746 --> 29:43.448
-I'm not even sure

29:43.515 --> 29:44.916
which finger is which.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.119
<i>I don't mean to be</i>
<i>a complete asshole,</i>

29:48.186 --> 29:51.289
but I just can't ignore
certain things.

29:51.356 --> 29:52.857
I really don't think
I did a bad job.

29:52.924 --> 29:54.692
<i>I think that she's a good base</i>

29:54.759 --> 29:58.196
and I can go back into it,
add the details.

29:59.864 --> 30:02.333
[Chris] This isn't a competition
to go back into it.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.136
You're here to do
one great tattoo and walk away

30:05.203 --> 30:07.238
{\an5}-and compete.

30:05.203 --> 30:07.238
-I understand, but--

30:07.305 --> 30:09.007
{\an5}-There's no buts.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.007
-[Lea] Okay, but--

30:09.073 --> 30:10.842
{\an5}-I mean, as far as this goes--

30:09.073 --> 30:10.842
-I mean, in five hours,

30:10.909 --> 30:12.210
this is...
this is what I have, so...

30:12.277 --> 30:15.146
I don't know if you guys
are just beat up or what,

30:15.213 --> 30:17.282
but I'm looking at the best five

30:17.348 --> 30:19.217
out of the ten that are here,

30:19.284 --> 30:21.886
and this week's tattoos
look like we're back

30:21.953 --> 30:23.154
in the beginning again.

30:23.221 --> 30:25.089
You know, I get it that here
we're supposed to, like,

30:25.156 --> 30:28.193
push ourselves, like, all the
way to the end, you know, but--

30:28.259 --> 30:29.661
You didn't come here
to win today.

30:38.369 --> 30:39.237
Shane.

30:43.641 --> 30:47.278
It's an action pinup,
which is just extraordinary.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.048
<i>To put an expression</i>
<i>on her face,</i>

30:50.114 --> 30:52.617
that just blew my mind, man.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.987
<i>The hair flow, you got</i>
<i>the red accents in her hair.</i>

30:56.054 --> 30:57.488
<i>The red ribbon.</i>

30:57.555 --> 30:59.324
Tremendous job, man.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.459
You really excelled
in the detail.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.727
<i>In the mouth, showing the teeth.</i>

31:02.794 --> 31:05.597
<i>It's very tricky to do</i>
<i>on pinups of this size.</i>

31:05.663 --> 31:07.632
<i>The little shadow</i>
<i>underneath the lip</i>

31:07.699 --> 31:08.833
<i>where the bottom lip comes out.</i>

31:08.900 --> 31:10.401
<i>It just gives it that depth.</i>

31:10.468 --> 31:12.003
Dude, yeah, you nailed it.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.339
I also wanted to say,
the shoes are phenomenal, man.

31:14.405 --> 31:17.442
{\an5}-[Chris] Shut up. My turn.

31:14.405 --> 31:17.442
-[Oliver] Shoes are phenomenal.

31:17.508 --> 31:18.576
[Chris] <i> I love the way you left</i>

31:18.643 --> 31:20.144
<i>a</i> <i>real clear</i>
<i>little negative spot</i>

31:20.211 --> 31:21.613
<i>under the pupil of the eye.</i>

31:21.679 --> 31:23.815
<i>It really makes that lid</i>
<i>come in.</i>

31:23.881 --> 31:25.216
Overall, you killed this thing.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.485
It's technically
a beautiful tattoo.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.720
It's proportionate.

31:28.786 --> 31:30.655
<i>And the choice of using</i>
<i>the action in the tattoo</i>

31:30.722 --> 31:33.258
<i>makes it stand out</i>
<i>from the stiff tattoos.</i>

31:33.324 --> 31:35.560
{\an5}-Great job, man.

31:33.324 --> 31:35.560
-Thank you, appreciate it.

31:41.132 --> 31:42.033
[Dave] James Vaughn.

31:48.039 --> 31:49.707
[Oliver] <i> I'm gonna get</i>
<i>right to the point.</i>

31:49.774 --> 31:51.276
This girl's got two right feet.

31:51.342 --> 31:52.477
What?

31:52.543 --> 31:56.114
[Oliver]
<i>She's got two right feet.</i>

31:56.180 --> 31:58.449
[Chris] <i> There's two big toes</i>
<i>in the grass.</i>

31:58.516 --> 32:00.385
[Oliver] James,
tell me what's up.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.755
Whoops.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.590
I wasn't even paying attention.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.492
For real,
this is a mistake, man.

32:07.558 --> 32:08.626
I mean, I get it,

32:08.693 --> 32:10.361
but you're
a consistent tattooer.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.362
I don't know what happened.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.664
I...

32:12.730 --> 32:14.365
I figured I didn't--
I didn't [bleep] it up too bad.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.601
In my... in my opinion.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.036
[Oliver] <i> You lost it</i>
<i>in the mouth, man.</i>

32:18.102 --> 32:19.771
<i>The shape of that top lip</i>
<i>and the teeth man,</i>

32:19.837 --> 32:21.539
<i>it's just scary-looking.</i>

32:22.774 --> 32:25.710
This to find out
who's the most well-rounded.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.745
You know what you came to do,
and you guys aren't doing it.

32:33.584 --> 32:34.452
[Dave] Josh.

32:39.324 --> 32:40.658
[Oliver] <i> You did a big tattoo.</i>

32:40.725 --> 32:43.561
<i>That's impressive that you</i>
<i>did that much in five hours.</i>

32:43.628 --> 32:45.496
[Josh] <i> I lucked out</i>
<i>by him wanting</i>

32:45.563 --> 32:47.332
<i>something colorful and cartoony.</i>

32:47.398 --> 32:49.000
I'm a fan of all the color.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.436
<i>The contrast on it, awesome.</i>

32:51.502 --> 32:54.439
<i>The shirt.</i>
<i>The bell-bottoms.</i>

32:54.505 --> 32:56.507
<i>The farm in the background.</i>
<i>The fence.</i>

32:56.574 --> 32:59.844
Everything you put on there.
Great job.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.679
One of the things
we're looking at

33:01.746 --> 33:03.348
this tattoo is proportion.

33:03.414 --> 33:04.782
<i>And the style</i>
<i>of the tattoo you did,</i>

33:04.849 --> 33:06.884
<i>realistic proportion</i>
<i>is out the window.</i>

33:06.951 --> 33:08.586
<i>But the style</i>
<i>that you went with,</i>

33:08.653 --> 33:11.522
<i>the oversized eyes</i>
<i>and head and body shape,</i>

33:11.589 --> 33:13.358
<i>I don't think this tattoo</i>
<i>is out of proportion.</i>

33:13.424 --> 33:15.560
I think you went all out.
Gung-ho, man.

33:15.626 --> 33:17.762
Bad-ass.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.964
Since day one, you've had
a couple bumps in the road,

33:20.031 --> 33:22.333
but you've been
a consistent big tattooer.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.103
In this competition,
I gotta judge these guys

33:25.169 --> 33:27.171
on that they did, and I
would have loved to have seen

33:27.238 --> 33:31.542
you do a pinup like them
to see what would've happened,

33:31.609 --> 33:34.512
but again, man, what you did,
you did, you know?

33:34.579 --> 33:35.446
You killed it.

33:39.684 --> 33:40.918
[Dave] Okay, artists.

33:40.985 --> 33:42.954
I think it's pretty clear
which way this is gonna go.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.224
Shane and Josh...

33:48.526 --> 33:49.427
You guys are safe.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.064
And while we're at it,
we may as well announce

33:53.131 --> 33:55.133
who had the best tattoo.
Chris?

33:59.837 --> 34:02.039
{\an5}-Shane, congratulations.

33:59.837 --> 34:02.039
-Thanks, man.

34:04.776 --> 34:10.581
We'd like to see
Tommy, Lea, and James

34:10.648 --> 34:12.750
up here for final elimination.

34:12.817 --> 34:14.018
We're gonna deliberate.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.821
When we see you back here,
somebody's going home.

34:27.331 --> 34:28.533
That was brutal.

34:28.599 --> 34:32.203
They had a buffet of [bleep]
to bust on tonight, man.

34:32.270 --> 34:36.139
Stubby arms, busted-up hands,
two right feet.

34:36.206 --> 34:38.141
{\an8}You can't be putting
two right feet on a--

34:38.208 --> 34:39.476
{\an8}that's just insane.

34:39.543 --> 34:40.911
[Tommy] This is awesome!

34:40.978 --> 34:43.281
The competitor in me wants
one of you [bleep] to go home.

34:47.952 --> 34:51.222
{\an8}I'm horrified by
the fact that I did this.

34:51.289 --> 34:53.524
<i>I really think</i>
<i>that I'm going home tonight.</i>

34:53.591 --> 34:56.594
[sighs]
I feel like such a damn [bleep].

34:56.661 --> 34:58.996
I'm stressed about it
for the customer, you know?

34:59.063 --> 35:00.631
[Tommy] You get to throw shoes
on her, dude.

35:00.698 --> 35:03.034
Maybe it'll hook us up
and boot one of you guys.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.001
[Tommy] That would be rad.

35:05.536 --> 35:06.404
[bleep].

35:07.071 --> 35:07.939
[bleep]!

35:22.587 --> 35:25.022
I-I didn't think
I dropped the ball too bad.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.224
I thought... I was like...

35:26.290 --> 35:28.226
[Shane] Dude, I swore to God,
they [bleep] you.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.394
I dropped the [bleep] ball
on the [bleep] feet.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.029
[Shane] <i> He just did a pinup</i>
<i>with two right feet.</i>

35:32.096 --> 35:33.731
That's a serious mistake.

35:33.798 --> 35:34.932
[Lea] I thought
you did a good job.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.701
I thought everybody
did a good job.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.936
[Shane] Yeah, but we're here
to do a great job.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.404
I don't think I did that bad.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.440
[Josh] At least you don't got
two right feet on that bad boy.

35:43.908 --> 35:46.210
[Shane] <i> We're mentally</i>
<i>and physically stressed here.</i>

35:46.277 --> 35:48.246
This is a serious competition.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.313
Lea was pretty confident.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.416
I don't know
what she was looking at.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.119
She don't bull[Bleep] either.
She's confident, dude.

35:56.721 --> 35:57.822
I don't know what's going on.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.423
[Tommy] I don't know either.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.825
[Shane] We'll see.
Yeah, who knows?

36:00.892 --> 36:03.060
{\an5}-[Tommy] Yep.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.060
-Who knows?

36:05.429 --> 36:06.264
Alright, guys.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.231
I think all three of them

36:07.298 --> 36:08.966
<i>are feeling the heat right now.</i>

36:09.033 --> 36:11.002
{\an5}-[Dave] Oh, yeah.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.002
-Oh, they're dying.

36:11.068 --> 36:14.238
All three of these tattoos
just totally botched the face,

36:15.606 --> 36:17.942
<i>which is a very,</i>
<i>very important part.</i>

36:18.009 --> 36:20.044
But one's a little less botched.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.746
And I'm stunned
with Tommy's face.

36:21.812 --> 36:23.948
[Oliver] <i> I think Tommy's face</i>
<i>might be the weakest.</i>

36:24.015 --> 36:26.484
[Dave] <i> She's no, you know,</i>
<i>beauty queen herself.</i>

36:26.551 --> 36:28.519
[Chris] Her...
her nose is a little busted.

36:28.586 --> 36:31.455
I'm sorry, but Tommy's face
outdoes the other two.

36:31.522 --> 36:33.491
Look at Tommy's face.
It's just beat!

36:33.558 --> 36:35.326
No. I totally disagree.

36:35.393 --> 36:39.764
[Dave] I can't overlook James
put two right feet on that girl.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.299
<i>How do you overlook</i>
<i>something like that?</i>

36:41.365 --> 36:44.235
I think James, you know,
drew two right feet,

36:44.302 --> 36:45.937
but it doesn't dismiss
the fact that Lea

36:46.003 --> 36:49.340
<i>did not put enough definition</i>
<i>into the pinup.</i>

36:50.474 --> 36:52.276
They equally did bad faces.

36:53.744 --> 36:56.247
<i>He did two right feet,</i>
<i>and she did one claw.</i>

36:56.314 --> 36:58.916
At least his right foot
looks like a right foot.

36:58.983 --> 37:01.953
I think as far as
the challenge of proportion,

37:02.019 --> 37:04.422
all three of these people
held up to that.

37:04.488 --> 37:06.390
The bodies are
put together well, except for

37:06.457 --> 37:08.192
the few elements
that we've been pointing out.

37:08.259 --> 37:09.126
[sighs]

37:09.193 --> 37:10.494
Alright, guys,
do we have a...

37:10.561 --> 37:11.862
{\an5}-A firm solution here?

37:10.561 --> 37:11.862
-I'm good.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.698
I have mine.
I have my answer.

37:13.764 --> 37:15.132
[Dave] Alright, man.
Let's do it.

37:18.035 --> 37:18.903
Oh, God.

37:19.837 --> 37:20.838
How y'all feeling?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.273
[James Like a dumbass.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.442
You know we need to see
Tommy, Lea, and James.

37:24.508 --> 37:25.710
{\an5}-Man!

37:24.508 --> 37:25.710
-Let's go.

37:25.776 --> 37:27.445
Let's do it.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.814
{\an5}-[Tommy] I'm already sweating.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.814
-[Oliver] Again?

37:37.521 --> 37:39.857
Tonight, we saw two great pinups

37:39.924 --> 37:41.459
and three
that were not so great.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.062
Tattoo mistakes
happen all the time.

37:45.129 --> 37:49.400
Here are three perfect examples
of, just, mistakes.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.136
It sucks that all three of you

37:52.203 --> 37:55.573
made these mistakes
on the same day

37:55.640 --> 37:59.877
in a national challenge
for $100,000.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.379
Obviously,
that would be the time

38:01.445 --> 38:03.180
you would hope
not to make a mistake.

38:04.281 --> 38:05.583
It's just been a rough ride.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.084
All you guys...
we're human.

38:07.151 --> 38:10.254
We don't pick you guys apart,
we pick apart what you give us.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.025
I would hope to see
somebody going home

38:14.091 --> 38:15.960
under different circumstances,

38:16.027 --> 38:18.529
but this is
what you signed up for.

38:18.596 --> 38:21.632
James, do you regret
taking the shoes off the design?

38:21.699 --> 38:24.702
Yeah, I was, like,
flabbergasted.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.070
<i>I'm more upset for the customer,</i>

38:26.137 --> 38:30.741
'cause it's my job to make
the best tattoo for my client,

38:30.808 --> 38:31.776
you know?

38:31.842 --> 38:33.711
And I try to pay attention
to detail.

38:33.778 --> 38:35.513
<i>It was just one thing</i>
<i>that is, you know,</i>

38:35.579 --> 38:37.815
<i>it's a cardinal sin, you know?</i>

38:37.882 --> 38:40.685
<i>I'm not gonna make up</i>
<i>any type of excuse whatsoever.</i>

38:40.751 --> 38:42.486
I've been tattooing a long time.

38:42.553 --> 38:44.989
One of the most
common questions people ask me

38:45.056 --> 38:46.090
about the business,
they're like,

38:46.157 --> 38:48.426
"Have you ever
messed up on anybody?"

38:48.492 --> 38:50.628
And I'm, like,
"All the time."

38:50.695 --> 38:52.563
And they're surprised at
that answer, 'cause they think

38:52.630 --> 38:55.466
that a tattoo artist
never messes up, man.

38:56.367 --> 38:57.401
Tommy, you've never been here.

38:57.468 --> 38:58.602
Um, no, I haven't.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.705
Is there anything that
you would do differently?

39:00.771 --> 39:02.506
[Tommy] <i> Fortunately,</i>
<i>there's things in this tattoo</i>

39:02.573 --> 39:04.341
<i>that, you know,</i>
<i>like, I can fix up.</i>

39:04.408 --> 39:07.244
<i>The nose... things in</i>
<i>this tiny, little pinup.</i>

39:07.311 --> 39:08.646
I don't think
my work's infallible.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.017
{\an5}-[Dave] Lea.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.017
-What happened?

39:13.084 --> 39:14.952
[Lea] <i> The gloves were</i>
<i>an afterthought.</i>

39:15.019 --> 39:17.655
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>that it was gonna affect,</i>

39:17.722 --> 39:18.789
<i>like, the hand like that.</i>

39:18.856 --> 39:20.324
I didn't realize
because I added it,

39:20.391 --> 39:22.059
like, after I did the drawing.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.161
And then when
I did the... he shading,

39:24.228 --> 39:26.931
<i>it changed everything.</i>

39:26.997 --> 39:29.400
[stammering]
<i>I think I put the glove thing</i>

39:29.467 --> 39:31.068
<i>in the wrong--</i>

39:31.135 --> 39:33.237
It's changing the whole arm.

39:33.304 --> 39:37.007
Also, in the stencil,
you had a nose line

39:37.074 --> 39:39.343
that made this face shape
look a lot better,

39:39.410 --> 39:41.879
but in tattoo,
the nose line's not there.

39:41.946 --> 39:44.515
<i>Just little details like that</i>
<i>could've made this tattoo</i>

39:44.582 --> 39:45.850
<i>a lot stronger.</i>

39:45.916 --> 39:47.885
That one line
will change the entire face.

39:47.952 --> 39:49.487
Faces are a son of a bitch,

39:49.553 --> 39:51.889
'cause they're one line away
from greatness or failure.

39:51.956 --> 39:55.092
It's just consistency,
and most everybody up here

39:55.159 --> 39:56.594
has shown consistency.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.296
All of you guys
have pretty much been hanging.

39:59.363 --> 40:00.931
Whether you win or whatever,

40:00.998 --> 40:03.000
you guys have all been
in the same position.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.635
Lea, you've been erratic.

40:07.571 --> 40:08.739
[Dave] The judges have decided.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.581
Lea...

40:17.648 --> 40:19.817
You don't have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

40:21.118 --> 40:22.787
Please, pack up
your machines and leave.

40:26.423 --> 40:29.160
Now is definitely
not the time to relax.

40:29.226 --> 40:31.395
The rest of you have
a one-in-four chance

40:31.462 --> 40:33.998
of claiming that $100,000 prize.

40:34.064 --> 40:36.233
[Oliver] Won't be too much room
for any more mistakes, guys.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.776
[Lea] <i> This is extreme tattooing.</i>

40:45.843 --> 40:47.111
I am an Ink Master.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.379
There is no doubt about that.

40:48.445 --> 40:50.848
<i>I just didn't have control over</i>

40:50.915 --> 40:52.616
<i>the cards that were given to me.</i>

40:52.683 --> 40:55.486
<i>Usually, I pick my game</i>
<i>and I win.</i>

40:56.954 --> 40:59.824
<i>It really, really hurts</i>
<i>and it's pretty devastating.</i>

41:03.027 --> 41:05.362
{\an8}[narrator] <i> On the next</i>
<i>episode of</i> Ink Master.<i> ..</i>

41:05.429 --> 41:07.364
{\an8}About to get my ass
handed to me in graffiti.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.433
{\an8}What the [bleep]?

41:09.500 --> 41:10.501
<i>[Shane] After all the [bleep]</i>
<i>talking Tommy did</i>

41:10.568 --> 41:12.803
{\an8}about being
a veteran graffiti artist,

41:12.870 --> 41:14.104
{\an8}<i>that looks like</i>
<i>a little kid did it.</i>

41:14.171 --> 41:16.173
{\an8}Apparently, he's pretty
[bleep] pissed off about it.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.708
{\an8}-[Tommy] Who's that?

41:16.240 --> 41:17.708
{\an8}-[Shane] You, man!

41:17.775 --> 41:19.176
{\an8}I didn't come here
to [bleep] make friends.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.145
{\an8}Games are over.
Time for the real deal.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.413
{\an8}[Dave] <i> You'll be creating</i>
<i>a portrait.</i>

41:22.479 --> 41:24.215
{\an8}Lord have mercy.

41:24.281 --> 41:25.182
{\an8}<i>If I don't win this challenge,</i>

41:25.249 --> 41:26.483
{\an8}I'm walking the [bleep] out.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.518
{\an8}The fact of the matter is,

41:27.585 --> 41:29.253
{\an8}you allowed that
to happen to yourself.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.088
{\an8}The placement of this thing
beat the hell out of you.
