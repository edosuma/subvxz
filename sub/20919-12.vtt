00:02.411 --> 00:05.086
[Dr. Jane Foster]
The Avengers are alive.

00:05.122 --> 00:08.039
I know for a fact that the Cabal
didn't disintegrate them.

00:08.074 --> 00:10.459
They just teleported them
away... far, far away.

00:14.690 --> 00:17.151
I discovered a way to back-trace the
missing Avengers through space-time.

00:17.175 --> 00:18.867
I can send you to them.

00:18.902 --> 00:21.570
These tethers
are your lifeline back.

00:21.605 --> 00:24.455
Find the Avengers, then activate
the tether to come home.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.753
Don't activate the tether until
you've found them. [Beeping]

00:26.777 --> 00:28.886
You will only
have one shot at this.

00:28.921 --> 00:31.338
One shot is all
we're gonna need.

00:31.373 --> 00:33.824
We're gonna find our friends
and bring 'em home.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.139
All right, Avengers.
Let's do it.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.636
[yelling]

01:04.638 --> 01:06.256
I think I'm in serious trouble!

01:06.291 --> 01:08.424
[grunts]

01:08.460 --> 01:10.352
I can't fly, I can't fly,
I can't fly! Aah!

01:12.440 --> 01:14.815
[screaming]

01:29.423 --> 01:31.206
Kamala! Captain Marvel, hurry!

01:34.495 --> 01:36.461
No, no, no, no, no... Yes!

01:41.735 --> 01:45.411
How do I thank you
for saving my life,

01:45.447 --> 01:48.448
besides saying, "Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you"?

01:48.484 --> 01:50.843
Don't thank me yet.
By the time this is over,

01:50.878 --> 01:52.477
you might wish I'd let you drop.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.379
No, I don't think I'd wish that.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.665
We need to figure out where we are
and find the missing Avengers.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.968
Pick a direction, Ms. Marvel.
Which way do we go?

02:00.003 --> 02:02.979
Don't ask me.
You're Captain Marvel.

02:03.015 --> 02:06.633
Just tell me what to do,
because you're my favorite hero,

02:06.668 --> 02:09.030
and you already rescued me once,
and I don't want to mess up again.

02:09.054 --> 02:11.772
Don't be such a fan-girl,
Kamala.

02:11.807 --> 02:14.207
You're an Avenger. Act like
you've done this before.

02:14.242 --> 02:17.736
We're on an asteroid
somewhere in deep space.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.997
I can't act like
I've done this before,

02:20.032 --> 02:22.124
because I haven't
done this before.

02:22.159 --> 02:24.342
My advice, kid: Fake it.

02:27.789 --> 02:29.940
What is it? Don't know.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.783
Never seen anything like it.

02:31.818 --> 02:35.862
Fire and the ice together?
Shouldn't be physically possible.

02:35.897 --> 02:39.165
Exactly. Totally agree,
Captain Marvel.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.718
Take your selfie,
and then come on.

02:41.753 --> 02:44.670
No selfie for me.
This mission is too important.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.514
No time for... Yeah, okay.

02:46.550 --> 02:47.574
[click]

02:49.619 --> 02:51.203
Right behind ya, Cap!

02:53.373 --> 02:56.508
So, I hate to ask,
but why are we climbing

02:56.543 --> 02:58.385
when we could just fly?

02:58.420 --> 03:00.654
Because we're trying
to keep a low profile.

03:00.689 --> 03:03.256
It's called
the "element of surprise."

03:06.570 --> 03:08.578
Heads up.

03:08.614 --> 03:11.606
What? What is it?

03:11.641 --> 03:13.350
[footsteps approaching]

03:18.081 --> 03:20.849
Easy, fellas.
We're not here to fight.

03:20.884 --> 03:23.368
Those are fighting words!

03:23.403 --> 03:24.903
Destroy the interlopers!

03:33.931 --> 03:35.372
[grunts]

03:36.767 --> 03:38.099
[grunts]

03:38.134 --> 03:40.126
[grunting]

03:44.132 --> 03:46.825
I've got him!
Tell me what to do with him!

03:46.860 --> 03:48.794
Kamala, just do what you do.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.912
Can you be more specific?

03:50.948 --> 03:53.256
Hit him!

03:53.292 --> 03:55.508
You heard what she said.
Nothing personal.

03:55.543 --> 03:56.559
[grunts]

04:00.074 --> 04:03.108
Whoa. You must be
the best of the bunch.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.454
You're good.
But you're not that good.

04:25.649 --> 04:28.066
[yelps]

04:28.101 --> 04:30.660
Kamala, the last one!

04:30.696 --> 04:32.429
[grunts]

04:34.332 --> 04:36.124
[grunts]

04:36.159 --> 04:38.643
Cool off! Wait. No.
Let me start over.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.857
Chill out! [Grunts]

04:46.295 --> 04:48.036
I've got questions.

04:48.071 --> 04:50.238
You better have some answers.

04:50.273 --> 04:52.907
Where are we,
and where are the Avengers?

04:52.943 --> 04:55.218
You're on
Her Majesty's asteroid.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.437
And I don't know
anything about Avengers,

04:57.472 --> 04:59.898
but the queen of the castle
will know.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.784
The queen of the castle
will dispose of you.

05:02.819 --> 05:04.352
[groans]

05:04.387 --> 05:06.821
Thanks for the help.

05:06.856 --> 05:08.656
We'll take it up
with the queen of the castle.

05:15.808 --> 05:17.432
[doors clang]

05:17.468 --> 05:19.184
We could be walking into a trap.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.277
Maybe. Probably?

05:21.312 --> 05:22.937
I don't know. What do you think?

05:28.695 --> 05:31.446
They know we're here. It'd be
rude to keep them waiting.

05:44.853 --> 05:46.844
[gasps]

05:46.880 --> 05:49.564
Thor's hammer!

05:49.599 --> 05:53.143
Thor wouldn't just leave his hammer.
What's it doing there?

05:53.178 --> 05:55.178
[woman] What's it doing?
[laughing]

05:59.318 --> 06:01.968
Why, it's my footrest.
One of a kind.

06:02.003 --> 06:03.903
Isn't it divine?

06:03.939 --> 06:05.563
Enchantress.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.342
How thrilling.

06:09.377 --> 06:12.228
I haven't had the chance
to entertain guests yet.

06:12.264 --> 06:15.682
You're the first ones
to visit my asteroid.

06:15.717 --> 06:17.817
Is that how the fire and
ice together is happening?

06:17.852 --> 06:19.786
Asgardian magic?

06:19.821 --> 06:21.922
Very perceptive.

06:21.998 --> 06:24.799
This beautiful little rock
hurtling through space

06:24.834 --> 06:27.569
is my personal kingdom.

06:27.604 --> 06:31.055
A fairy-tale palace
and servants who adore me.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.741
Everything is perfect,

06:33.777 --> 06:35.552
and it's all mine.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.725
[thud] His head?

06:42.760 --> 06:45.337
That's the creepiest thing
I've ever seen.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.580
Since you're in such
a good mood, Enchantress,

06:47.616 --> 06:49.060
why don't you tell us
where the Avengers are?

06:49.084 --> 06:50.958
Starting with Thor.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.928
Really? That's what
you're on about?

06:53.963 --> 06:57.374
And I was feeling
so magnanimous.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.535
I'm bored of the Avengers,
and I'm bored of you.

07:00.570 --> 07:03.605
Oh, bodyguard!

07:03.640 --> 07:07.592
Bodyguard, your beautiful queen
is being inconvenienced.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.829
Be a dear and bring
Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel

07:10.864 --> 07:12.839
to their knees.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.638
[yells] I'd rather be
hitting the Enchantress,

07:20.674 --> 07:22.223
but you'll do, bodyguard.

07:23.593 --> 07:26.445
[yells, grunts]

07:26.521 --> 07:28.938
So not fair when someone
that big is that quick.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.852
[Captain Marvel]
Now, while he's down!

07:40.351 --> 07:42.201
Thor?

07:42.237 --> 07:45.496
[both grunt] [laughing]

07:45.531 --> 07:48.141
Ever since I cast
an enchantment on him,

07:48.177 --> 07:51.477
Thor has been my favorite plaything.
[grunting]

07:51.512 --> 07:55.164
And he's perfect, because he
does whatever I want him to.

07:55.199 --> 07:57.934
[yells] [grunts]

07:57.970 --> 07:59.636
[both grunt]

08:04.376 --> 08:07.418
Well done, plaything. Well done.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.646
[laughing]

08:15.687 --> 08:18.763
[Captain Marvel] Kamala?

08:18.798 --> 08:21.324
[moans] Kamala, you okay?

08:21.359 --> 08:22.975
Huh? [Gasps]

08:23.011 --> 08:24.410
[grunts]

08:29.501 --> 08:32.067
I think so. I mean,
other than waking up in jail.

08:32.102 --> 08:34.602
[grunts]

08:34.639 --> 08:38.140
Solid. And probably enchanted.

08:38.176 --> 08:41.836
Our tethers are gone! They're
our only way to get home.

08:41.871 --> 08:44.270
What are we supposed to do
without... [footsteps approaching]

08:46.593 --> 08:49.235
We're not alone.

08:49.270 --> 08:52.488
Thor, it's us, big guy.

08:52.523 --> 08:54.816
[singsongy] We're your friends.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.779
Look at you,
trying to talk to my toys.

08:59.815 --> 09:02.031
Oh, but Thor doesn't talk.

09:02.067 --> 09:05.618
Not unless I want him to.

09:05.654 --> 09:08.229
You are enemies of the queen.

09:08.265 --> 09:11.866
This was your game... to join the
Cabal so you could capture Thor?

09:11.901 --> 09:15.644
Ha! I joined the Cabal
for the power.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.998
But if I'm being honest,
I did it because

09:18.033 --> 09:21.142
I wanted Thor
for a very long time.

09:21.177 --> 09:24.904
And he's so much fun.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.365
Remember back
on the Leader's airship?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.367
You dared to hit me.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.578
Aw, somebody's mad.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.964
You're speaking
to the Enchantress.

09:34.999 --> 09:38.326
I don't hold grudges.
I finish them.

09:38.362 --> 09:41.996
[screaming]

09:42.032 --> 09:43.281
[both grunt]

09:46.169 --> 09:48.645
Let's get outta here.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.400
But what if it's another...
[yells] [grunts]

09:51.600 --> 09:52.982
[grunts]

09:53.018 --> 09:54.917
[groans] ...trick?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.797
Welcome to my Arena of Sport.

10:01.859 --> 10:03.634
Uh, I better let you
take the lead

10:03.670 --> 10:06.104
on this, Captain Marvel.

10:06.181 --> 10:09.156
Hm! Never pictured you
as someone who's into sports.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.993
Oh, I'm quite the sports fan.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.347
You see, I invented my own game
that I'll watch you play.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.624
It's simple, with only one rule:

10:17.659 --> 10:20.510
Stay alive.

10:20.545 --> 10:22.787
Feel free to use
whatever you find

10:22.822 --> 10:26.999
in the chests of mystery
to aid you in your fight.

10:27.034 --> 10:28.576
Our fight against what?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.975
My snowman.

10:36.011 --> 10:39.479
[chuckles] Aw, that's not so bad.
We got this.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.182
I built him myself.

10:42.217 --> 10:45.902
And he just loves hugs.
[evil laughter]

10:45.937 --> 10:48.154
[roaring]

10:48.189 --> 10:49.514
Aw, crud.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.796
[yells]

11:04.831 --> 11:07.206
[growling]

11:07.241 --> 11:09.634
[grunts] This hurts.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.936
Hey, ugly! Let her go!

11:11.972 --> 11:13.496
[grunts]

11:18.494 --> 11:19.494
Huh?

11:27.854 --> 11:29.503
[roaring]

11:29.538 --> 11:31.072
[grunts]

11:31.107 --> 11:33.207
[laughing]

11:33.243 --> 11:35.576
I do love sports.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.605
The intensity, the drama,
the cruelty.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.942
Sports are like war,
only with more hate.

11:42.977 --> 11:45.144
Yes, my queen.

11:45.179 --> 11:48.272
Sorry. I'm not much help.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.833
Will you stop apologizing so much?
Whoa!

11:50.868 --> 11:53.194
[gasps] Just like a video game.

11:53.229 --> 11:54.912
Maybe there's
an extra life inside?

11:56.391 --> 11:58.098
[sighs] Nope.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.151
Anything in there we can use?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.721
I don't know. Maybe.

12:02.797 --> 12:05.531
I don't want to mess up again.
What do you think?

12:05.566 --> 12:07.709
This is not the time
to be precious.

12:07.744 --> 12:09.711
This is the time
to do something.

12:09.746 --> 12:12.672
I don't know
what I'm looking for!

12:12.707 --> 12:15.358
What have you got so far?

12:15.393 --> 12:17.568
A bunch of electronic junk
and chemicals.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.229
We can work with that.

12:20.265 --> 12:22.373
[roaring]
Hey, Abominable slushy!

12:22.408 --> 12:25.251
This way!

12:25.286 --> 12:28.321
Heads up! Kamala, now!

12:29.758 --> 12:30.782
[grunts]

12:38.983 --> 12:41.667
What kind of monster
would destroy a snowman?

12:43.188 --> 12:44.462
[grunts]

12:46.967 --> 12:49.158
I'm so sorry.

12:49.193 --> 12:51.227
What are you trying
to apologize for?

12:51.262 --> 12:53.654
Because. I want us to be

12:53.690 --> 12:55.798
one of those classic
superhero team-ups.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.975
But instead,
I never know what to do

12:58.011 --> 12:59.935
because I'm afraid
of messing up.

12:59.970 --> 13:03.572
So what if you mess up?
Nobody's perfect.

13:03.608 --> 13:07.059
And being perfect isn't as
important as being decisive.

13:07.095 --> 13:09.495
You're an Avenger,
so take the initiative.

13:09.530 --> 13:12.072
Try something. See if it works.

13:12.108 --> 13:13.624
You were fortunate, Avengers.

13:13.660 --> 13:18.145
But soon, I'll put you back
in the arena again and again,

13:18.180 --> 13:20.039
until your fortune runs out.
[grunts]

13:21.776 --> 13:25.619
[grunts]

13:25.655 --> 13:27.680
I took the initiative
and came up with a plan.

13:27.716 --> 13:29.732
Run!

13:29.767 --> 13:30.800
[grunting]

13:36.941 --> 13:38.307
We're not gonna outrun him.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.347
We're not trying to.
We just need him to follow us.

13:44.382 --> 13:46.582
If we get Thor
to touch his hammer,

13:46.618 --> 13:48.333
it might break the enchantment.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.043
So we don't have to fight him.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.305
We just have to slow him down.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.607
Yeah, that'll be so much easier.
[running footfalls]

13:54.642 --> 13:56.467
Watch your step. [Grunts]

13:56.502 --> 13:57.994
Or don't.

13:58.029 --> 14:01.397
[both grunting]

14:01.432 --> 14:03.932
[grunts]
Never turn your back on me.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.493
Not unless you wanna
get knocked out.

14:05.528 --> 14:07.003
[groans]

14:07.038 --> 14:09.639
[both grunting]

14:09.641 --> 14:11.615
This may have been a mistake!
[grunts] [yells]

14:11.651 --> 14:13.709
[grunts]

14:13.744 --> 14:16.211
[both straining]

14:16.247 --> 14:19.415
Come on, Thor.
You don't serve the Enchantress.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.609
Remember who you really are!

14:21.644 --> 14:23.394
[straining] [grunts]

14:25.690 --> 14:28.816
That's your hammer.
Only you can lift it.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.495
Thor? [Grunts] [grunts]

14:32.530 --> 14:34.831
[Enchantress laughing]

14:34.866 --> 14:38.183
Fools! As if I would
make it that easy.

14:38.219 --> 14:39.968
Kamala!

14:40.004 --> 14:42.213
You annoying mortals
may have managed

14:42.248 --> 14:44.690
to defeat my Snow Beast.

14:44.725 --> 14:48.152
But no one can survive
against the might of Thor.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.213
Thor, I've grown tired
of this one.

14:51.249 --> 14:53.591
Dispose of her. Yes, my queen.

15:02.877 --> 15:04.260
Oh...

15:04.295 --> 15:07.087
Dispose of Captain Marvel.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.207
[yells]

15:09.242 --> 15:10.691
[grunting]

15:13.396 --> 15:16.288
[grunts] Sorry, Thor.

15:16.324 --> 15:19.584
I know you're not you, and I
didn't wanna have to hurt ya.

15:19.661 --> 15:22.370
But now I'm gonna have to hurt ya!
[cries out]

15:22.405 --> 15:25.039
[grunts, groans]

15:26.358 --> 15:28.542
[grunts]

15:30.288 --> 15:32.213
[both grunting]

15:33.574 --> 15:35.216
[grunts]

15:37.778 --> 15:42.473
Such devastation.
Such brutality. Such fun!

15:42.508 --> 15:44.266
[both grunting]

15:46.029 --> 15:48.554
Captain Marvel needs help.

15:48.590 --> 15:51.582
I gotta do something.
I gotta do anything.

15:51.618 --> 15:55.110
I gotta beat up the Enchantress!
[yells]

15:55.146 --> 15:57.530
What is that? [Grunts]

15:57.565 --> 16:01.159
[all grunting]

16:01.194 --> 16:05.821
I should've ended your miserable
life when you first arrived!

16:05.857 --> 16:08.766
That is harsh.
Only one way to respond to that.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.834
Embiggen! [Grunts]

16:11.646 --> 16:13.788
[grunts]

16:13.823 --> 16:15.881
Farewell, mortal.

16:20.738 --> 16:23.715
[growling]

16:23.750 --> 16:26.425
"Farewell"?
Why? Are you leaving?

16:26.460 --> 16:28.302
[yells]

16:28.337 --> 16:30.705
Bad monster! Bad toothy monster!

16:30.740 --> 16:33.107
[grunting]

16:36.496 --> 16:38.237
[growling continues]

16:40.450 --> 16:43.292
[screeching]

16:43.327 --> 16:45.694
I got one, I got one!
[yells, grunts]

16:45.729 --> 16:47.038
[grunts]

16:49.467 --> 16:51.133
[grunts] [grunts]

16:51.169 --> 16:53.469
[screaming]

16:53.505 --> 16:55.612
[both grunt]

16:55.648 --> 16:56.714
Kamala! [Yells]

17:00.970 --> 17:03.137
Look, Thor. Look at Ms. Marvel!

17:04.781 --> 17:06.580
Finish her, my pet.

17:06.617 --> 17:08.750
[growling]

17:08.786 --> 17:10.935
[roars]

17:13.566 --> 17:15.824
[snarls] [screams]

17:15.859 --> 17:18.777
[screeching]

17:18.813 --> 17:21.538
That heroism
is who you really are.

17:21.574 --> 17:25.643
Ms. Marvel?

17:25.678 --> 17:29.054
And Captain America, Iron Man,

17:29.090 --> 17:31.749
Black Widow, Falcon,
Hawkeye, and Hulk!

17:31.784 --> 17:34.126
Do you remember?

17:34.161 --> 17:36.370
[Enchantress]
You put up quite the struggle.

17:36.406 --> 17:40.207
But all sports have to end,
and you're all out of time.

17:40.242 --> 17:42.159
[yells]

17:42.194 --> 17:44.578
[grunts] I say thee nay!

17:44.614 --> 17:46.180
[grunts]

18:02.707 --> 18:05.616
Thor has returned! [Grunts]

18:09.889 --> 18:14.801
No! Thor belongs to me!
[wind howling]

18:14.877 --> 18:17.720
The piercing pain of ancient winters.
[grunting]

18:17.755 --> 18:21.624
Ice! Ice so cold that it burns!
[grunts]

18:21.659 --> 18:24.135
[evil laughter]

18:29.784 --> 18:31.475
[yells]

18:36.666 --> 18:38.607
[grunts]

18:38.643 --> 18:40.317
A little ice never bothered me.

18:47.401 --> 18:50.452
I had a perfect kingdom,
and you ruined it!

18:52.623 --> 18:55.624
If my beautiful world
has to be destroyed,

18:55.660 --> 18:57.501
then you'll go with it!

19:13.836 --> 19:16.863
The asteroid...
It's changing course!

19:16.939 --> 19:20.032
I've directed this asteroid
into the nearest star.

19:20.068 --> 19:24.045
Everything will be incinerated,
including the likes of you.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.081
Good-bye, Avengers.

19:27.116 --> 19:29.116
We must depart, quickly!

19:29.151 --> 19:31.152
No. Wait. Look!

19:31.187 --> 19:33.653
Everyone on the asteroid
is here.

19:33.689 --> 19:35.631
[Captain Marvel]
We can't just leave them.

19:35.666 --> 19:38.767
But there is no way
to evacuate everyone.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.328
I got it!

19:41.364 --> 19:43.444
It's not the perfect plan,
but I think it might work.

19:46.969 --> 19:48.480
[Captain Marvel]
We're almost out of time.

19:48.504 --> 19:50.813
Thor, you're on!

19:50.848 --> 19:53.249
Then let mine enchanted hammer,

19:53.284 --> 19:56.768
by the power of Thor,
by the might of Odin,

19:56.804 --> 19:58.403
by the... Hurry it up!

19:58.439 --> 20:00.314
Oh, so be it.

20:03.586 --> 20:05.110
[thunderous yell]

20:07.915 --> 20:08.915
[hammer blow lands]

20:12.836 --> 20:14.411
[rumbling]

20:32.348 --> 20:35.557
Not bad, kid.
I mean, you saved the day.

20:35.592 --> 20:39.086
So you did good, I guess.
But, you know, not bad.

20:39.121 --> 20:41.922
Well... [clears throat]
no one's perfect.

20:41.957 --> 20:44.066
[Enchantress] You may have
won this little skirmish,

20:44.102 --> 20:46.602
but my side has won the game.

20:46.637 --> 20:48.938
Heed my warning.

20:48.973 --> 20:50.948
You have not yet
begun to suffer.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.658
Huh!

20:52.694 --> 20:54.576
Well, that didn't sound ominous.

20:54.612 --> 20:56.912
Best not to pay her mind.

20:56.947 --> 21:00.166
Our work here is done.
Let us head home.

21:00.201 --> 21:03.727
Problem with that. Enchantress
took our tethers. We're stuck.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.947
You have no need for a tether.
You have me.

21:06.982 --> 21:08.549
Heimdall, open the Bifrost!

21:12.772 --> 21:15.014
[chuckles] Sweet!

21:22.590 --> 21:25.432
We're home. Back on Earth.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.601
It's been awhile.

21:27.636 --> 21:29.469
I wonder what we've missed.

21:29.505 --> 21:37.505
