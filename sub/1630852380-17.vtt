WEBVTT

00:06.658 --> 00:08.486
Peppermint oil for nausea.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.445
Vitamin A for stretch marks.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.708
A meditation pillow
for relaxation.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.623
Yes, and a sun lamp for mood.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.494
Are we worried this is
a little much?

00:16.538 --> 00:19.062
We just want
to make sure Stacey has

00:19.106 --> 00:21.064
everything she needs
while we're tied up at court.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.762
Hey, about court, um, Professor
Kingston's finally got time

00:23.806 --> 00:25.547
to help me workshop ideas
for my book,

00:25.590 --> 00:27.418
but he wants
to start today, so...

00:27.462 --> 00:28.941
I'm gonna have
to miss the trial.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.074
Lucky you. I wouldn't
even be going, but Blake

00:31.118 --> 00:33.381
is demanding the Carringtons
present a united front.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.991
It turns out
Uncle Ben

00:35.035 --> 00:36.993
is only challenging
Blake's inheritance.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.951
Mine is still resting
safe and sound,

00:38.995 --> 00:41.041
just like Stacey will be
if that goose down comforter

00:41.084 --> 00:43.217
ever gets here. Jeanette-- Oh.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.523
You know my birthday's
not till December, right?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.351
Just like Jesus.
How could I forget?

00:47.395 --> 00:49.832
We just want you to feel
like the manor is your home.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.399
This isn't
our biggest suite,

00:51.442 --> 00:53.053
but my favorite nanny,
Heather, used to

00:53.096 --> 00:55.229
live here, so I've always
had a soft spot for it.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.795
Blake was
busy working and...

00:56.839 --> 00:58.623
Alexis was trying
to claw her way to the top

00:58.667 --> 01:01.148
of the Peach Tree Society,
so Heather basically raised us.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.672
Ah, that sweet Carrington legacy
I hear so much about.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.500
Aw, did anyone
ever tell you that

01:05.543 --> 01:07.893
you're the cutest when you're
the strong and silent type?

01:07.937 --> 01:09.895
And don't worry, I promise you

01:09.939 --> 01:12.985
the legacy of being a bad parent
ends with Blake and Alexis.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.204
And what's this?

01:14.248 --> 01:15.510
An annotated catalogue

01:15.553 --> 01:17.077
of cultural touchstones

01:17.120 --> 01:18.904
my brother and I really enjoyed
as children.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.646
Feel free to start our baby
off with some of the classics.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.692
You know,
maybe <i>Un Chien Andalou?</i>

01:23.735 --> 01:25.781
There's a copy
in the screening room.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.913
Blake's called a
Carrington family meeting.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.655
Then it's a good thing
I'm a Deveraux,

01:30.699 --> 01:32.788
because I don't have time
for a family meeting.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.877
NordicStar
has selected

01:34.920 --> 01:37.401
their finalists for
the new uniform design contest,

01:37.445 --> 01:39.011
and I made the cut.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.187
That's great news.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.666
I wasn't finished yet.

01:41.710 --> 01:42.972
It's down to me

01:43.015 --> 01:44.539
and Lainie Sullivan...

01:44.582 --> 01:47.019
that no-talent
millennial designer.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.934
Well, you're a much better
designer than she is.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.241
Sadly, it's not
just about talent.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.591
NordicStar is posting
the looks online,

01:53.635 --> 01:55.158
and letting the people decide.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.812
Well, isn't that good news?

01:56.855 --> 01:58.683
You've got
tons of fans from FSN.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.946
Of course,
and I love my "Dominoes."

02:00.990 --> 02:04.036
But our show only averages
1.4 million viewers.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.474
And she has
over 14 million followers

02:06.517 --> 02:08.171
on TikTok alone.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.521
After all of my hard work,
it comes down to another

02:10.565 --> 02:14.003
popularity contest between me
and another Insta-blond.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.137
Well... Blake and I

02:17.180 --> 02:19.748
are here to support
you however we can.

02:19.791 --> 02:23.534
Just like I hope you'll be
at the trial to support us.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.885
Subtle.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.149
Just because I came to my senses

02:29.192 --> 02:30.976
about which brother is better

02:31.020 --> 02:33.718
doesn't mean
I want to sit by Blake's side

02:33.762 --> 02:35.807
on a wooden
courtroom bench.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.027
Then how about
sitting by my side?

02:38.070 --> 02:39.550
If Blake loses,

02:39.594 --> 02:41.291
he'll have to pay
Ben the equivalent

02:41.335 --> 02:43.119
of what he inherited
from Thomas.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.077
Since there's
no C.A. anymore,

02:45.121 --> 02:46.688
and Blake and I
merged companies,

02:46.731 --> 02:48.385
most of that
would come from Flores.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.909
It would decimate
my family's business.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.737
Fine.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.957
I'll come to the family meeting.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.873
But there better be mimosas.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.483
And croissants.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.879
Please, no snark.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.663
I just got off
an eight-hour flight

03:05.707 --> 03:07.622
that only had
vegan entrees left.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.363
And I had to fly alone
because Amanda's still in London

03:09.406 --> 03:10.842
working on her green card stuff,
okay?

03:10.886 --> 03:12.366
I come snark-free.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.629
I just wanted
to welcome you home.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.370
Oh, God, it's even worse
than I thought.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.459
What have you done?

03:18.502 --> 03:20.287
Nothing, I promise.
No, everything...

03:20.330 --> 03:22.071
everything's going
really well at Alexam,

03:22.114 --> 03:23.855
and I'm just...

03:23.899 --> 03:25.335
I'm turning over a new leaf,
you know?

03:25.379 --> 03:26.989
I'm not dwelling
on the past anymore.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.947
I even signed up
for some dating apps.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.472
Wow. I'm really happy for you.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.648
I'm still not sure why you're
telling me this, though.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.780
Well, I figured if Mother can
get over her issues

03:35.824 --> 03:37.521
with you,
then I could do the same.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.219
What are you talking about?

03:39.262 --> 03:41.917
Oh, she left you a note,
some... some big apology.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.136
Maybe you haven't found it yet.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.661
Or maybe she changed her mind
once she got in here.

03:46.704 --> 03:49.359
You know, sometimes with Alexis
it's about baby steps.

03:49.403 --> 03:52.057
Alexis was in here unsupervised?

03:52.101 --> 03:54.059
I'm sure Mrs. Gunnerson
has some sage

03:54.103 --> 03:56.105
lying around so you can smudge.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.381
Well, I'm usually
more of a gym rat,

04:11.425 --> 04:15.167
but I got to admit this
sunrise hike/yoga sesh

04:15.211 --> 04:16.995
doesn't totally suck.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.780
That view alone
was worth it, right?

04:18.823 --> 04:20.260
Most definitely.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.609
Oh. Corny.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.350
Good thing
you're so cute.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.439
Cute and smitten.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.181
I know it hasn't been long,

04:29.225 --> 04:31.532
but I got to admit,

04:31.575 --> 04:33.011
this is
something special.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.491
I think so, too.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.756
You know what else is
a great workout?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.323
Mm.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.586
- Dancing.
- Oh.

04:42.630 --> 04:45.372
I hear Leon Bridges is coming
to the Sahara Club next week.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.591
I'm sure the co-owner

04:47.635 --> 04:49.680
could pull a few
strings, get us in?

04:49.724 --> 04:51.726
You know...

04:51.769 --> 04:53.945
I actually don't like

04:53.989 --> 04:55.643
going to the club
when I'm not working. Oh.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.601
But Leon plays
in New York

04:57.645 --> 04:59.429
a lot, so... Uh-huh.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.213
...maybe we could
fly up there,

05:01.257 --> 05:03.128
catch a show--
Michael, stop.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.391
I know what this is about.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.740
I mean, at least, I think I do.

05:05.783 --> 05:06.915
You do?

05:06.958 --> 05:09.309
Yeah. And I appreciate you

05:09.352 --> 05:11.876
for trying to protect me
from going back

05:11.920 --> 05:14.226
to the place where my husband
had his accident, but...

05:14.270 --> 05:15.706
there's no reason
to avoid the club.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.229
There's not?

05:17.273 --> 05:19.101
No. I've been meaning

05:19.144 --> 05:21.321
to talk to you about my past,

05:21.364 --> 05:24.106
but this has been going so
well, I didn't want to...

05:24.149 --> 05:26.674
mess things up by admitting
I'm not exactly traumatized

05:26.717 --> 05:28.153
by Leo's death.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.547
Yeah, I know,
it sounds horrible.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.333
No, no, it doesn't. You, you,
you can tell me anything.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.423
Leo was amazing when we met,

05:36.466 --> 05:38.163
but after we got married,

05:38.207 --> 05:39.817
he became a different person.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.950
And, eventually, I found out
he was involved with some

05:41.993 --> 05:44.039
very scary people.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.868
I was about to leave him
when he died.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.609
Okay.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.828
I hope you don't think I'm
a monster for feeling like that.

05:50.872 --> 05:53.744
No, absolutely not.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.704
I'm very glad that you told me.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.707
You have no idea.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.059
All right, we've got a lot to
discuss and not a lot of time.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.801
Don't worry, Father,
- I'm here to support you.
- And...

06:06.844 --> 06:08.455
I appreciate that.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.848
But you are the one person
I need to stay away.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.502
This trial will be swimming
with press,

06:12.546 --> 06:14.765
and I don't want to remind them
that you've just been fired

06:14.809 --> 06:17.028
as Chief of Staff.
It doesn't look good.

06:17.072 --> 06:19.291
Yeah, of course.
What-whatever you need.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.555
"Swimming with press"?
Interesting.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.687
Irrelevant. I looked up
the statute of limitations

06:23.731 --> 06:25.515
on overturning a will--
it's ten days.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.125
This shouldn't even be
going to trial.

06:27.169 --> 06:28.779
Well, my lawyers
explained to me

06:28.823 --> 06:30.738
that because Ben
was never notified

06:30.781 --> 06:33.871
of the original reading of the
will, that statute is void.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.525
But there are no
copies of your conversations

06:35.569 --> 06:37.440
with Thomas's lawyer,
so what is there to discuss?

06:37.484 --> 06:39.877
Ben has always insisted
that he left me a note

06:39.921 --> 06:42.402
telling me to watch over Mother
on the night that she died.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.142
If he can convincea judge

06:44.186 --> 06:45.927
that's that true,
and that I lied

06:45.970 --> 06:47.494
to Thomas about it...

06:47.537 --> 06:49.452
the will could
be overturned.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.454
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...

06:51.498 --> 06:53.761
did you... lie?

06:53.804 --> 06:56.416
No! There was
never any note!

06:57.417 --> 06:59.723
Ben was trying to cover his ass.
I just need to prove it.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.377
And I have no doubt
that you will.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.466
So call me when you're
ready for us to take

07:03.510 --> 07:05.120
a victory photo on
the courthouse steps.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.905
Did you forget that I
also inherited the manor

07:07.949 --> 07:10.386
from Thomas, the one that
is currently slated to go

07:10.430 --> 07:11.387
to my future
grandchild?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.258
Uncle Ben is going after

07:13.302 --> 07:14.825
my child's legacy?

07:14.869 --> 07:16.392
Uh-uh.
Not on my watch.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.655
When you say
"swimming with press,"

07:18.699 --> 07:21.136
are we talking print,
broadcast or both?

07:31.407 --> 07:33.540
<i>Professor Kingston, so...</i>

07:33.583 --> 07:35.890
I cracked one of my ideas,
and I finally made it

07:35.933 --> 07:37.718
"to the deep end."
I'd really love your input.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.284
And I can't wait to help,
but we just need

07:39.328 --> 07:41.112
to deal with one thing
before we can do that.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.288
Uh, Jasper?

07:43.332 --> 07:46.117
Uh, this is
my nephew, Jasper.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.294
I was hoping you could, uh,
offer him some guidance.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.166
Yeah, of course.
Nice to meet you, Jasper.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.124
Are you thinking
about switching to my class?

07:53.168 --> 07:55.910
Uh, not really,
my uncle's just prepping me

07:55.953 --> 07:57.694
for the summer writing program
in Amsterdam.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.783
Yeah, I did that, too. You're
gonna have a great time, man.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.003
Exactly what I've been
telling him. Um...

08:02.046 --> 08:04.048
you can go now.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.746
Seems like a nice kid.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.356
He's an idiot.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.140
And he has two weeks
to submit his story

08:09.184 --> 08:11.491
for consideration and I was
hoping you could mentor him.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.057
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, I'd be happy

08:13.101 --> 08:14.755
- to take a look at what he's got.
- Well...

08:14.798 --> 08:16.321
this may take more
than just a look.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.149
I got you. Um...

08:18.193 --> 08:19.847
yeah, I mean, it'll be tight,

08:19.890 --> 08:21.805
but I can, I can meet
with him early, before class,

08:21.849 --> 08:23.459
and then you and I can meet
in the afternoons.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.939
There's no need.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.723
Your book isn't due
for another 18 months,

08:26.767 --> 08:28.595
so you could take the next
few weeks to focus on Jasper.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.248
You don't mind, right?

08:30.292 --> 08:32.207
Yeah, sure.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.861
Yeah, I'm...
I'd be happy to help.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.080
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.563
I need your help with Alexis.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.783
Why am I already dreading
- the rest of this conversation?
- Because

08:42.826 --> 08:45.568
you know I wouldn't be asking
if it weren't an emergency.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.614
You and I have very different
definitions of that word.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.485
My father left me a diary
where he recorded pretty much

08:49.529 --> 08:52.662
every bad thing Blake ever did.
I barely skimmed it,

08:52.706 --> 08:54.403
but it's full of serious stuff.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.579
And somehow Alexis found it,
and she took it.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.581
Uh, pause. Uh, rewind.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.714
You're saying
there's a written record

09:00.757 --> 09:03.325
of every bad thing
Blake has ever done?

09:05.675 --> 09:09.113
That's not the point! The point
is my father left it for me

09:09.157 --> 09:10.854
for protection, and
Alexis is going to use it

09:10.898 --> 09:13.640
for war. I don't know
what she's planning,

09:13.683 --> 09:15.076
but I'm willing to bet
it'll be soon

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
with this trial about to start.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.383
Okay, I, uh,
I get the emergency.

09:18.427 --> 09:21.212
I just don't get
how this applies to me.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.997
You were married to
the witch. All I'm asking

09:23.040 --> 09:26.522
is for you to talk to her,
and-and try and get it back.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.438
Alexis and I may have
divorced amicably,

09:29.481 --> 09:32.833
but you are delusional if you
think she's gonna hand over

09:32.876 --> 09:35.531
a bible of Blake's biggest sins.
Or if you think I care

09:35.575 --> 09:37.315
about Blake's secrets
getting out.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.927
Look, despite
a few shared chromosomes,

09:39.970 --> 09:42.973
Carrington problems are
- not my problem.
- You sure about that?

09:43.017 --> 09:45.846
- Mm-hmm.
- Because in Alexis's hands, this thing is like a nuclear bomb.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.369
And there will be
collateral damage.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.066
Probably involving your mother.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.460
And definitely
involving me.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.549
If Blake finds out
this was my fault,

09:53.593 --> 09:55.638
he'll go full Blake on me.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.597
He'll destroy
my relationship with Amanda.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.686
He'll have me banished from
Atlanta. Who knows what else...

09:59.729 --> 10:02.253
Okay, okay, I get it. Goodness.

10:02.297 --> 10:05.039
All right, look,
when Alexis and I were married,

10:05.082 --> 10:07.737
she kept everything important
in her safe.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.479
She's not exactly tech-savvy,

10:10.522 --> 10:12.263
so I'd be shocked

10:12.307 --> 10:14.178
if she changed the combination.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.658
Thank you so much.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.660
That said,
there is no way I'm helping you

10:17.704 --> 10:20.097
break into Alexis's penthouse.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.360
Is it breaking in
if I just walk in the door?

10:22.404 --> 10:24.841
Because Amanda's in London,

10:24.885 --> 10:27.365
and, uh, I have her keys.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.760
Oh, look.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.241
It's Uncle Bane of my Existence.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.416
It's nice to see you, Fallon.

10:34.459 --> 10:35.939
Sorry I can't say the same.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.288
You know, once upon a time,
we were close.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.899
Don't you remember?

10:38.942 --> 10:40.422
I try to block out
all of my childhood memories,

10:40.465 --> 10:41.902
you know, just to be safe.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.773
Your father isn't the man
you think he is.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.601
Ah, but that's
where you're wrong.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.603
I know exactly
who both of you are.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.736
And soon
everyone else will, too.

10:49.779 --> 10:52.303
Hello.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.175
Dominique, over here!

10:54.218 --> 10:56.612
Dom-Mystique has created
four seasonal looks

10:56.656 --> 10:59.136
for NordicStar's
flight attendants.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.052
Enjoy exclusive access
to "summer"

11:02.096 --> 11:04.707
and don't forget,
voting is live.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.056
Looking good, Dominique!

11:06.100 --> 11:08.319
All rise
for the Honorable Judge Drexel.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.325
As the presiding judge

11:14.369 --> 11:16.501
over this bench trial,
I will assume

11:16.545 --> 11:18.765
the role of fact-finder

11:18.808 --> 11:21.768
and rule on all procedural
and evidentiary issues.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.248
In laymen's terms...

11:24.292 --> 11:26.642
there's no jury to convince,
just me.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.078
Let's begin.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.732
According
to the coroner's report,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.734
Evelyn Carrington
died on Friday,

11:31.778 --> 11:34.215
November 24, 2000.
Is that correct?

11:34.258 --> 11:36.304
Yes, the Friday
after Thanksgiving.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.219
My parents lived in Savannah,

11:38.262 --> 11:40.090
but Mother's caregiver
was off for the holiday,

11:40.134 --> 11:42.484
so Father decided to spend
the weekend in Atlanta.

11:42.527 --> 11:43.833
And why did she need
a caregiver?

11:43.877 --> 11:45.182
A few months prior,
Mother suffered

11:45.226 --> 11:46.749
a head injury while skiing.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.316
It left her moody and...

11:48.359 --> 11:49.752
paranoid and very frail.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.667
She didn't trust
strangers, so we agreed

11:51.711 --> 11:53.495
that Blake would dismiss
the staff for the weekend

11:53.538 --> 11:55.540
and we'd take turns staying
with Mother around the clock.

11:55.584 --> 11:59.153
On the night in question,
the others wanted to put

11:59.196 --> 12:01.633
in an appearance
at the lymphoma charity gala,

12:01.677 --> 12:04.549
so I, I agreed
to take the first shift.

12:04.593 --> 12:05.855
Are you sure you don't
want to go to the gala?

12:05.899 --> 12:07.335
I'm thrilled.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.510
You know I hate
all that society stuff.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.904
Unlike my beautiful wife
who lives

12:10.947 --> 12:12.862
for the junior league drama.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.473
Hey, it's not every day
Mildred Wennington's nose

12:15.517 --> 12:18.607
collapses in on itself.
I will take a picture. Okay...

12:18.650 --> 12:20.391
Steven, Fallon,
have fun

12:20.435 --> 12:22.437
on your Thanksgiving campout,
and remember...

12:22.480 --> 12:24.265
Heather's gonna come by
to check on you to make sure

12:24.308 --> 12:26.223
you're asleep, so get in there.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.445
Oh, one of our oil rigs is down.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.839
I knew I shouldn't have given
the crew the holiday off.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.492
Damn unions.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.233
Hey, you cannot
miss the gala.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.148
Uncle Ben, tell us a story!
Story!

12:38.192 --> 12:40.194
Okay.
Good luck.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.239
Thank you.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.589
All right, you scoundrels,
but, really, just one,

12:44.633 --> 12:45.808
Okay?
Okay.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.070
<i>I intended to head up</i>

12:47.114 --> 12:48.115
<i>to Mother's room</i> <i>
as soon as I'd finished</i>

12:48.158 --> 12:49.812
<i>"The Cremation of Sam McGee,"</i>

12:49.856 --> 12:51.640
<i>but Blake wasn't the only one</i> <i>
with a problem.</i>

12:51.683 --> 12:53.773
<i>My ex-wife and daughter were</i> <i>
in Paris for the week</i>

12:53.816 --> 12:55.165
<i>and had apparently</i> <i>
lost their passports,</i>

12:55.209 --> 12:56.732
<i>so I had to head home.</i>

12:56.776 --> 12:59.039
<i>But I knew who to turn to</i> <i>
for help.</i>

12:59.082 --> 13:01.476
Unacceptable!
Every hour that oil rig

13:01.519 --> 13:03.260
is down is costing me millions.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.262
Uh-huh.

13:05.306 --> 13:08.352
Well, that is an
intriguing solution.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.528
Tell me more.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.443
Right.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.445
I see.

13:16.447 --> 13:18.406
Okay.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.280
<i>I was surprised</i> <i>
he was being so agreeable,</i>

13:23.324 --> 13:25.326
<i>so I didn't stick around</i> <i>
for him to change his mind.</i>

13:25.369 --> 13:27.023
Of course,
Blake ignored the note,

13:27.067 --> 13:29.330
like he ignored all of
his familial responsibilities.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.854
I just, I didn't expect him
to lie about it for years.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.944
Ben is the one who's lying
through his capped teeth.

13:34.988 --> 13:38.034
Is that all your brother lied
about concerning that night?

13:38.078 --> 13:39.557
No, not at all.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.603
Turns out,
his oil rigs were fine.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.997
The only emergency Blake
was working on that night

13:44.040 --> 13:46.260
was how to get the nanny alone

13:46.303 --> 13:48.001
so he could have sex with her.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.750
The nanny, I presume?

14:07.890 --> 14:11.024
- You slept with Heather?
- It was barely a fling.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.243
The affair lasted for a year.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.158
Okay, it was maybe a little more

14:15.202 --> 14:17.204
than a fling,
but she seduced me.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.901
It started the night of Fallon's

14:18.945 --> 14:21.382
first grade <i>
Nutcracker</i> performance.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.340
I remember that Blake stayed
home that night

14:23.384 --> 14:25.038
for a C.A. emergency,

14:25.081 --> 14:26.778
but when everyone left,

14:26.822 --> 14:28.476
he invited me
to have a drink with him.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.652
So while I danced <i>
The Nutcracker,</i>

14:30.695 --> 14:33.089
her sugar plums
danced in your face?

14:34.917 --> 14:37.746
So Blake used
the same "C.A. emergency" excuse

14:37.789 --> 14:39.661
to have sexual relations
with you

14:39.704 --> 14:41.445
on the night
of Evelyn Carrington's death?

14:41.489 --> 14:44.535
Yes. There was
no C.A. emergency,

14:44.579 --> 14:47.321
but there were
definitely sexual relations.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.976
And a little role-play.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.893
And as far as you know,
Blake Carrington made

14:53.936 --> 14:55.938
no effort to check
on his mother that evening?

14:55.982 --> 14:57.853
No, there was
no mention of Evelyn.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.942
In fact, the only woman
that he was calling Mommy

14:59.986 --> 15:01.726
that night was me.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.555
Well, that doesn't prove
a thing.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.079
No, it just proves
that you're a terrible father.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.037
And a terrible husband.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.866
Okay, we'll have a brief recess.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.955
I could use a coffee. Excuse me.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.566
Cristal...
Just wait.

15:15.610 --> 15:18.004
Fallon, hello.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.006
Look at you, all grown up.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.746
I hope this hasn't
affected you

15:21.790 --> 15:24.227
too much, you know.
I do have fond memories.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.447
Of me? Or of fondling my father?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.275
You're as spirited as ever.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.929
Blake.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.234
This is Trent.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.976
Your son.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.461
I'm just kidding, no.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.811
This is, this
is my nephew.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.031
You remember Genie,
my mean sister?

15:45.074 --> 15:47.381
You wanted to have
a threesome once?

15:48.164 --> 15:50.166
It's good seeing you two.

15:55.084 --> 15:58.044
Not. One. Word.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.136
We should restock on
sweet tea vodka before

16:03.179 --> 16:04.920
the Leon Bridges show.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.878
Are you gonna be around
- that evening?
- Mm-hmm.

16:06.922 --> 16:10.143
I was thinking of bringing
a woman I'm seeing with me.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.014
Oh.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.669
He is dating someone. Who?

16:14.712 --> 16:16.801
It's Geneva.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.978
You're kidding,right?

16:19.021 --> 16:21.328
I mean, I'm sure you don't
really mean Geneva,

16:21.371 --> 16:23.286
the widow of the man
we helped kill.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.810
Because that would
obviously be insane.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.508
Or would it be cute

16:27.551 --> 16:29.205
in an "ain't fate funny" way?

16:29.249 --> 16:30.598
Are you trying to get us killed?

16:30.641 --> 16:32.295
Geneva isn't trying
to kill anyone.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.558
She told me
that Leo was a bad dude

16:34.602 --> 16:36.212
and she's glad he's dead.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.214
That is exactly

16:38.258 --> 16:40.173
what someone who was trying
to kill you would say

16:40.216 --> 16:42.262
to put your mind at ease...
right before they kill you!

16:42.305 --> 16:44.568
I think
I'm in love with her, Sam.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.962
Okay?

16:49.573 --> 16:51.923
Which is why I need to tell her
what really happened.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.404
I need to be honest
with her.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.624
Can I be honest with you?

16:56.667 --> 16:59.670
If you're going to insist
on dating this woman,

16:59.714 --> 17:02.064
then you cannot tell her
what we did to her husband.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.805
I will obviously
leave you out of it.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.068
This is just a bad idea, okay?

17:06.112 --> 17:08.723
Either I'm right and...

17:08.766 --> 17:11.334
she'll have even more reason
to murder you,

17:11.378 --> 17:14.250
or you're right,
and it'll just reopen

17:14.294 --> 17:16.426
wounds that she's
already managed to heal.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.515
What am I supposed to do?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.082
I don't know how to move forward

17:20.126 --> 17:21.953
with such a big secret
between us.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.216
Well, then you need
to figure it out.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.913
And if you care
about Geneva,

17:24.956 --> 17:26.088
you should let her move on.

17:27.002 --> 17:30.049
Just let the past
stay where it belongs.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.141
Well, it's like Ben said,
I was waiting in my office

17:35.184 --> 17:36.577
for the others
to leave for the gala

17:36.620 --> 17:38.144
so I could be with Heather,
but that's

17:38.187 --> 17:40.885
the only truthful thing
my lying brother said.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.018
Unacceptable.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.456
Every hour that oil rig is down
is costing me millions.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.111
Don't worry,
I'll make sure your rig

17:49.155 --> 17:51.635
is fully functional tonight.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.376
Uh-huh, that is

17:53.420 --> 17:56.901
an intriguing solution.
Tell me more.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.687
<i>That's when Ben came into</i> <i>
my study to steal my whiskey.</i>

17:59.730 --> 18:01.123
<i>Not leave a note.</i>

18:01.167 --> 18:03.169
See you soon, lover.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.823
Aah!

18:07.260 --> 18:09.349
<i>The jacket was ruined, but...</i>

18:09.392 --> 18:10.611
<i>it didn't matter.</i> <i>
I wasn't planning</i>

18:10.654 --> 18:12.700
<i>on wearing it that long anyway.</i>

18:14.702 --> 18:17.531
I hope the kids didn't sap
all your energy.

18:17.574 --> 18:20.099
Thanksgiving has put me
in a very...

18:20.142 --> 18:22.449
giving mood.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.538
Maybe we don't talk
about the kids right now.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.542
<i>We eventually moved upstairs</i>

18:28.585 --> 18:30.805
<i>where it was</i> <i>
a little more private.</i>

18:30.848 --> 18:33.155
Just want to be sure I'm clear.

18:33.199 --> 18:36.115
You lied about having
a work emergency.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.553
You lied about having an affair
with your children's nanny.

18:39.596 --> 18:42.121
But you want us to believe
that you're finally telling

18:42.164 --> 18:44.166
the truth about not getting
your brother's note?

18:44.210 --> 18:47.735
Yes. Because there was no note.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.172
I would not knowingly
leave my mother to die.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.913
What kind of monster
do you think I am?

18:51.956 --> 18:54.524
That's what we're here
to find out, Mr. Carrington.

18:55.482 --> 18:56.831
<i>Hello?</i>

18:56.874 --> 18:58.702
Anyone home?

18:58.746 --> 19:00.574
Alexis just pulled into
the Peachtree Society dinner.

19:00.617 --> 19:03.925
If memory serves, she won't be
home or sober for hours.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.709
And the GPS in Dex's car

19:05.753 --> 19:07.668
is still pinging
from his office across town.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.365
You should be in the clear.

19:09.409 --> 19:12.063
Look for the safe behind one
of her big pieces of art.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.587
Bingo.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.589
All right, the book has
to be in there.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.373
Let me know when you're ready
for the combination.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.161
Don't think I'll need it.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.945
She must've moved the whole
safe after the break-in.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.729
I'm gonna have to search
the entire penthouse.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.558
Kirby?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.299
Was that the elevator?

19:32.780 --> 19:35.217
Kirby?

19:35.261 --> 19:37.176
Kirby, is someone there?

19:53.540 --> 19:54.889
Kirby?

19:54.932 --> 19:56.325
What are you doing here?

19:56.369 --> 19:58.109
Dex, what are you doing here?

19:58.153 --> 19:59.850
I live here.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.026
Right.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.377
I-I just meant I didn't see
your car in the garage.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.596
And security said
no one was here.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.250
Because no one was until now.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.296
Uh, I met a colleague for drinks

20:10.339 --> 20:11.993
after work,
so I caught a car home.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.430
Now that we've established
why I'm in my own home,

20:14.474 --> 20:16.258
why are you here?

20:16.302 --> 20:19.392
Amanda wanted me
to get her EarPods.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.698
But, you know,
she's upset with Alexis,

20:21.742 --> 20:22.960
she didn't want to chance
bumping into her,

20:23.004 --> 20:24.223
so she gave me her key.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.486
Ah... okay.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.575
Well, maybe next time let us
know if you're gonna drop by.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.229
Alexis and I are usually

20:30.272 --> 20:32.187
clothing-optional
when we're alone.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.971
Got it. Thanks.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.191
At least I know
where I'm never dropping by.

20:40.891 --> 20:44.591
I read your outline, and,
uh, well... it's a start.

20:44.634 --> 20:47.028
I'm a computer science major.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.377
I'm only applying
to this program

20:48.421 --> 20:50.205
because every man
in my family has done it,

20:50.249 --> 20:51.685
and they think that
studying in Amsterdam

20:51.728 --> 20:53.295
is some kind
of rite of passage.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.384
But I'm not a writer,
as you can clearly tell.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.907
Yeah, okay,
we'll get there.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.518
We can double
your sessions and...

20:58.561 --> 21:00.346
You already have us scheduled
twice a week.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.652
What are we gonna do,
move in together?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.785
Look, I don't know
what you want from me, man.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.526
I'm trying my best here.

21:06.569 --> 21:07.701
Can't you just write it for me?

21:09.529 --> 21:11.661
I'm sorry?

21:11.705 --> 21:13.707
You're a writer.
Just bang something out, bro.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.230
It'll save us both
a ton of time,

21:15.274 --> 21:16.884
and then you can get
back to your book.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.581
Look, I get
that you're frustrated,

21:18.625 --> 21:20.453
but I would never do that.

21:20.496 --> 21:23.325
Okay, A] it's wrong, and
B] writing is deeply personal.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.545
However long it takes,
we're gonna get you there.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.111
Okay?

21:27.155 --> 21:28.852
Hey, barkeep?

21:28.896 --> 21:31.333
Keep 'em coming.
Make the next one a double.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.597
May I ask why you're
drowning yourself in seltzer?

21:34.641 --> 21:36.512
I'm trying to numb the pain

21:36.556 --> 21:38.340
of whatever Blake's gonna do
to me when he finds out

21:38.384 --> 21:40.690
that Alexis is now in possession

21:40.734 --> 21:43.345
of my father's book
of Blake's dirty secrets.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.868
You mean the book
of secrets that I watched you

21:44.912 --> 21:45.869
burn last year?

21:45.913 --> 21:47.349
That's the one.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.873
Um, unfortunately,
I did not burn the copy

21:49.917 --> 21:51.658
that I made or any
of the documentation

21:51.701 --> 21:53.181
that my father left
along with the book.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.096
Which clearly
I should have because...

21:55.139 --> 21:57.403
secrets always come back
to haunt you.

21:57.446 --> 21:59.100
Well, let's not exaggerate.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.755
Not all secrets come back.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.583
Yes, they do.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.585
It's been 20 years,
and Blake and Ben's secrets

22:05.628 --> 22:07.326
are spilling all
over the place.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.415
The past never
stays in the past.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.068
None of this would
even be a problem

22:11.112 --> 22:12.548
if Alexis's stupid,
creaky floorboard

22:12.592 --> 22:13.767
hadn't given me away.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.943
"Creaky floorboard"?

22:15.986 --> 22:18.685
In her brand-new
multimillion-dollar penthouse?

22:18.728 --> 22:21.296
Just like Alexis to be
all style and no substance.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.821
Wait a minute, this could
actually be the one time

22:24.865 --> 22:28.390
the past coming back
might be helpful.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.349
<i>Do you need help?</i>

22:30.392 --> 22:32.133
"Help"? No, I'm fine.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.439
I just...

22:33.482 --> 22:34.875
I threw my back out
and I'm having

22:34.918 --> 22:36.224
a little trouble unclipping.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.399
Oh, well, let me see...

22:37.443 --> 22:38.879
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.229
It's-it's okay.
My sister will kill me

22:41.272 --> 22:43.623
if I allow her pregnant
gestational carrier

22:43.666 --> 22:46.756
to exert herself
on my behalf.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.410
I was

22:48.454 --> 22:50.760
pushing myself
because I have a date today.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.588
Does this date have
"stubborn to a fault"

22:52.632 --> 22:54.982
on her list of turn-ons?
Because at this rate

22:55.025 --> 22:56.897
I think you're gonna have
the date in here.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.074
I won't tell if you won't.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.163
Okay, okay.

23:05.514 --> 23:06.733
Okay, just to the right.

23:06.776 --> 23:07.951
- Oh, there we go, oh!
- Oh, whoa!

23:14.262 --> 23:15.568
Um, yeah, thanks, yeah.

23:15.611 --> 23:16.960
Sure, yeah.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.441
Um, good luck with your date.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.096
And with your back.

23:24.838 --> 23:26.753
<i>And how long were you married?</i>

23:26.796 --> 23:28.058
18 years.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.799
Though it felt like 80.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.541
If the military is ever looking
to replace waterboarding,

23:32.585 --> 23:35.936
may I suggest marriage
to Blake Carrington?

23:35.979 --> 23:37.981
Objection. Improper character.

23:38.025 --> 23:40.419
Sustained. Mrs. Dexter,

23:40.462 --> 23:42.551
I instruct you to please
limit your testimony

23:42.595 --> 23:45.249
to facts around the night
Evelyn Carrington died.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.295
Of course.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.384
And you may call me Alexis, Judge.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.344
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

23:53.388 --> 23:56.435
Thomas and I got home
from the gala around 11:00.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.045
The gala was a total bore,

23:58.088 --> 24:00.308
and, sadly, Mildred's
nose looked fine.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.441
Got to get the name
of her doctor.

24:02.484 --> 24:05.139
You are perfect. Mmm.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.794
Exactly as you are.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.623
<i>I expected Blake</i> <i>
to be in a mood</i>

24:10.666 --> 24:13.452
<i>given the C.A. disaster,</i> <i>
but he was in high spirits.</i>

24:13.495 --> 24:15.366
<i>And now I know why.</i>

24:15.410 --> 24:19.153
I hope all that mingling
didn't sap your energy.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.504
Because Thanksgiving
has put me

24:22.548 --> 24:25.159
in a very giving mood.

24:25.202 --> 24:27.683
Oh, what's that?

24:27.727 --> 24:30.294
<i>Something in Blake's pocket</i> <i>
was poking me.</i>

24:30.338 --> 24:32.514
<i>And not in a fun way.</i>

24:32.558 --> 24:35.474
Uh, it's just
some work nonsense.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.040
Nothing to worry about.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.086
Now, where were we?

24:44.874 --> 24:47.660
It was Thomas.

24:47.703 --> 24:50.358
He had just found
his wife dead in the bathtub.

24:50.401 --> 24:53.666
When Ben told us
his side of the story,

24:53.709 --> 24:56.146
I couldn't get that little
piece of paper out of my mind.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.279
So I went back and fished it
out of the trash.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.716
It was a notefrom Ben

25:00.760 --> 25:03.066
to Blake, asking him
to watch Mother.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.287
Objection!

25:06.330 --> 25:08.202
To the temperature in this room.

25:08.245 --> 25:10.030
No need to wear
winter wool in the heat...

25:10.073 --> 25:12.641
because Dom-Mystique has created

25:12.685 --> 25:15.775
four seasonally appropriate
looks for NordicStar.

25:15.818 --> 25:18.212
♪Spring.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.041
Hey.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.869
I thought you said
you never saw the note.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.914
I didn't, because
there was no note.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.482
Your mother, the witch,
is lying like always.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.831
Order! Everyone sit down!

25:28.875 --> 25:30.354
Consider yourself lucky

25:30.398 --> 25:31.965
that I'm not holding you
in contempt of court.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.054
Another stunt like that,
and I will.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.882
Don't worry,
I've finished all four seasons.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.797
I'm thrilled.

25:37.840 --> 25:41.104
And do you have any proof
that this note existed?

25:41.148 --> 25:43.890
Otherwise,
it'll be Blake's word

25:43.933 --> 25:45.587
against that
of his scorned ex-wife.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.154
As a matter
of fact, Your Honor...

25:47.197 --> 25:48.547
I do.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.075
Oh, you lying bitch!

25:55.118 --> 25:56.903
Order!

25:56.946 --> 25:58.818
<i>You</i> lying bitch.

26:04.737 --> 26:07.696
You can't... I'll give it right back,
I promise.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.570
Feel free to have
a forensic investigator

26:11.613 --> 26:13.267
take a look,
but I assure you, it's real.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.312
As you can see,
it's written on one

26:15.356 --> 26:17.663
of those tacky
"Y2-Carrington" buck slips

26:17.706 --> 26:20.143
Blake insisted on
having made that year.

26:20.187 --> 26:22.450
I'm sorry I didn't say
anything sooner, but...

26:22.493 --> 26:24.017
I couldn't risk
Blake finding out

26:24.060 --> 26:26.236
and making up another story.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.717
You're welcome to stay at the
manor when I take possession.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.501
I know
what the house means to you.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.068
And it would mean a lot
to me to have a chance

26:32.112 --> 26:34.593
to get to know my future
great-niece or nephew.

26:44.428 --> 26:47.475
My date is in an hour and
I can barely move my neck.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.477
Any chance your
help services are

26:49.520 --> 26:51.435
open for business?

26:51.479 --> 26:54.134
Aw, I can't leave you hanging
before a big first date.

26:55.396 --> 26:58.225
I got to admit

26:58.268 --> 27:00.096
I'm a little jealous.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.272
I never have any luck
on those dating apps.

27:02.316 --> 27:05.101
- I find that hard to believe.
- Well, it turns out

27:05.145 --> 27:08.017
men interested in single moms
with teenage sons

27:08.061 --> 27:11.064
away at boarding school
who are also knocked up

27:11.107 --> 27:13.457
with other women's babies
are in short supply.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.851
I need a special app for that.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.461
Hmm.
There.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.422
I think you look really nice.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.250
Thank you. Oh.

27:23.293 --> 27:26.079
One sec.

27:26.122 --> 27:26.906
Great.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.255
Now that I'm all dressed,

27:28.298 --> 27:30.344
- my date is canceling.
- Well, it's...

27:30.387 --> 27:32.520
it's no fancy lunch date,
but I was about to take

27:32.563 --> 27:34.957
a crack at some of those
Carrington classic movies--

27:35.001 --> 27:36.437
the ones that you and Fallon
used to watch

27:36.480 --> 27:39.135
when you were kids--
if you want to join.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.703
Actually, that's
Fallon's other brother.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.532
Steven. I only met Fallon
a few years ago.

27:44.575 --> 27:45.620
Wait, really?
Yeah.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.796
I was kidnapped as a baby.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.930
The perils of being the eldest
son of a billionaire, I guess.

27:50.973 --> 27:54.150
Uh, I was raised by a single mom

27:54.194 --> 27:56.892
in Montana on a steady diet
of grilled cheese

27:56.936 --> 27:59.112
and soap operas.

27:59.155 --> 28:01.070
Incredibly unglamorous.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.638
It's probably why everyone
treats me like an outsider here.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.248
Definitely why I don't know

28:05.292 --> 28:07.424
which tiny fork to use
for the oysters.

28:07.468 --> 28:10.340
It's also probably
what makes you so normal.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.734
Honestly, you're...

28:12.778 --> 28:14.257
the only person in this place

28:14.301 --> 28:16.129
who makes me feel
like I can be myself.

28:18.871 --> 28:20.916
I'll just go grab that movie?

28:20.960 --> 28:23.005
Okay.
Okay.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.892
You look like you could use
something stronger than coffee.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.981
Maybe cyanide?
Yeah, maybe.

28:42.024 --> 28:44.113
I just got
an email from my publisher.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.333
They want my manuscript
in six months.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.727
Okay, I'm sure you can turn it
in sooner if you want.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.772
It took me two and a half years
to write my last novel.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.340
I'm sure you can turn it in
later if you want.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.516
I wish I could,
but the movie is premiering

28:55.559 --> 28:57.997
in six months and they want
to "capitalize on the hype."

28:58.040 --> 29:00.216
I mean, they've already
set up a whole marketing plan,

29:00.260 --> 29:02.262
a book tour, the works.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.177
This is a nightmare.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.396
Would it help to hear
- that I believe in you?
- It would help

29:06.440 --> 29:08.877
if I didn't have
a baby due in seven months,

29:08.921 --> 29:12.359
a major teaching commitment, and
a bonehead freshman to tutor.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.013
Look, I am no writer.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.755
But I do have a lot
of experience running a hotel.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.800
And when things build up,
I just tackle

29:18.844 --> 29:20.802
the least important things first
to get 'em off my plate.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.718
So that when Bruno Mars
asks me to host

29:23.762 --> 29:26.808
a last-minute soiree,
I can make it happen.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.332
Then I'm not, you know,
running around, trying to...

29:29.376 --> 29:32.509
keep the knives spinning
and the plates up in the air.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.642
Wow, that was a
great metaphor.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.731
Maybe I am a writer.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.441
BAILIFF:This court is now
back in session.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.096
DREXEL:Counsel informs me that we
have heard all the testimony.

29:54.140 --> 29:56.272
As such, I am prepared
to rule in the matter

29:56.316 --> 29:58.579
of Thomas Carrington's
will and trust.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.886
Wait, you haven't heard
all the testimony.

30:00.929 --> 30:03.366
I assume you're talking
about yourself.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.847
Objection! Your Honor, she's not
even on the witness list.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.110
Trust me, you're gonna want
to hear what I have to say.

30:08.154 --> 30:11.113
Yeah, "so help me God,"
all of that. Anyway...

30:11.157 --> 30:14.029
after Uncle Ben read us
that creepy story

30:14.073 --> 30:17.076
about the frozen guy, Steven
and I couldn't fall asleep,

30:17.119 --> 30:20.296
so we went to look for Blake
to make us feel better.

30:20.340 --> 30:23.560
Now, we had no idea that he was
making someone else feel better,

30:23.604 --> 30:25.693
but whatever,
that's not the point.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.129
Daddy?

30:27.173 --> 30:29.436
It's okay,
we'll leave him a note.

30:29.479 --> 30:32.482
He'll come find us
as soon as he reads it.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.620
This way,
no monsters will find it.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.578
Only Dad.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.711
You see,

30:43.754 --> 30:45.669
Blake really didn't
see the note.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.280
It wasn't on his desk

30:47.323 --> 30:50.196
when he got back because we had
moved it to his coat pocket.

30:50.239 --> 30:52.763
And he never put
his coat back on,

30:52.807 --> 30:55.157
because as we all heard, he
ruined it with a double espresso

30:55.201 --> 30:57.333
while he was primping
for his mistress.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.422
Bailiff, the note, please?

31:02.469 --> 31:04.645
I'm sorry, Ms. Carrington,
there's only writing

31:04.688 --> 31:06.560
on one side,
and it's your uncle's.

31:06.603 --> 31:08.214
You must be misremembering.

31:08.257 --> 31:10.042
Your Honor,
may I borrow your marker?

31:10.085 --> 31:12.392
And the buck slip, please?

31:13.741 --> 31:15.525
You see...

31:15.569 --> 31:18.746
Steven was in a real <i>
Harriet the Spy</i> phase.

31:18.789 --> 31:20.530
And he loved leaving

31:20.574 --> 31:22.924
secret messages
with a wax pencil.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.712
May I?

31:30.976 --> 31:33.500
"Daddy, we heard a monster.

31:33.543 --> 31:36.459
Please come help us
when you read this."

31:36.503 --> 31:39.549
Although this certainly is
an interesting development,

31:39.593 --> 31:42.422
it doesn't contradict
your mother's account.

31:42.465 --> 31:43.945
Which I'm inclined
to believe,

31:43.989 --> 31:46.382
as she was in possession
of the note all these years.

31:46.426 --> 31:47.427
Actually...

31:47.470 --> 31:49.777
no, she wasn't.

31:49.820 --> 31:50.778
And you are?

31:50.821 --> 31:51.953
Kirby Anders.

31:51.997 --> 31:52.954
My father was
the majordomo at the manor.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.174
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Overruled.

31:55.217 --> 31:56.915
- I'll hear her out.
- My father and I

31:56.958 --> 31:58.220
were on holiday
for the week,

31:58.264 --> 31:59.613
and when we got back,
he found

31:59.656 --> 32:01.571
Blake's ruined jacket
in the study.

32:01.615 --> 32:02.964
He also found the note.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.661
But he thought it meant
that Blake was guilty,

32:04.705 --> 32:06.446
- so he hid it.
- He told you all this?

32:06.489 --> 32:08.927
He wrote about it in his diary.

32:10.058 --> 32:12.582
Which Alexis stole
from me last week.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.889
Perjury is a crime...

32:14.933 --> 32:16.673
Alexis.

32:16.717 --> 32:19.372
Would you like to make any
amendments to your testimony?

32:19.415 --> 32:21.548
I may have embellished

32:21.591 --> 32:23.898
a few details from that night.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.161
Or all of them,
but for God's sake,

32:26.205 --> 32:28.250
even Anders thought
Blake did it.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.948
DREXEL:It's clear that a
terrible tragedy

32:29.991 --> 32:32.472
occurred on the night
Evelyn Carrington died.

32:32.515 --> 32:35.997
But the biggest tragedy is
the grave miscommunication

32:36.041 --> 32:39.000
between Ben and Blake Carrington
that led to her death.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.872
After hearing all the testimony,
it is clear

32:41.916 --> 32:44.440
that Ben Carrington did leave
a note for his brother

32:44.484 --> 32:46.051
on the night in question.

32:46.094 --> 32:47.617
Thank you.

32:47.661 --> 32:50.229
You may have written
a note, Mr. Carrington,

32:50.272 --> 32:52.579
but it was still
your responsibility to ensure

32:52.622 --> 32:54.320
that your mother had
proper care before leaving,

32:54.363 --> 32:55.886
which you did not do.

32:55.930 --> 32:58.367
And because Blake
never saw the note,

32:58.411 --> 33:00.630
I find no
undue influence

33:00.674 --> 33:02.023
on his part
in the matter.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.591
The will stands.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.723
Remember, voting is live.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.074
Thank you all for coming.

33:18.648 --> 33:21.477
I got to hand it to you. I'm
usually more of a pop, rock,

33:21.521 --> 33:25.090
hip-hop kind of gal, but jazz
night doesn't totally suck.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.005
I'm telling you,

33:27.048 --> 33:28.919
jazz is making a comeback.

33:28.963 --> 33:31.009
Mm.

33:32.532 --> 33:35.143
Michael... you okay?

33:37.667 --> 33:39.365
Not really.

33:40.714 --> 33:43.282
I've done something pretty bad.

33:43.325 --> 33:46.546
And I can't keep it
a secret from you.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.026
What is it?

33:50.941 --> 33:53.683
My ex-girlfriend came into town.

33:54.771 --> 33:56.469
And...

33:56.512 --> 33:58.732
- I slept with her.
- I don't understand.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.777
Yesterday you said
we had something special.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.562
I thought
we were on the same page.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.868
I thought so, too, but...

34:04.912 --> 34:07.262
I guess I just...

34:07.306 --> 34:09.525
haven't been honest with myself

34:09.569 --> 34:11.614
about the past.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.225
I really can'tdo this.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.575
So I-I...

34:15.618 --> 34:18.099
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.319
Oh.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.756
Wow, um...

34:22.799 --> 34:25.150
okay.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.890
I guess I should have taken

34:26.934 --> 34:28.805
the hint when you blew me off
the first time.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.505
You're kind of an ass,
Michael Culhane.

34:32.548 --> 34:33.506
Geneva, wait.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.075
I'm sorry.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.991
You are an incredible woman.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.604
And you deserve the world.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.693
I know.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.093
You okay?

34:55.136 --> 34:56.311
No.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.661
But you were right.

34:58.705 --> 35:02.100
Telling Geneva the truth
would have just hurt her,

35:02.143 --> 35:04.885
and I couldn't live with the lie

35:04.928 --> 35:07.105
and be together, so...

35:07.148 --> 35:09.063
For what it's worth...

35:10.195 --> 35:11.935
...I'm really impressed
with you.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.502
Thanks.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.330
I don't know why I keep
doing this to myself.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.680
You know,
maybe I'm just supposed

35:17.724 --> 35:19.378
to be single forever.

35:19.421 --> 35:22.381
So we're back to not
looking for love?

35:22.424 --> 35:24.905
At this point,
if love wants to find me,

35:24.948 --> 35:27.429
it's gonna have
to hit me in the face.

35:30.389 --> 35:33.174
I figured if you win,
we can celebrate.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.350
And if you lose,

35:35.394 --> 35:38.092
well, you'll probably
want a drink.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.486
Seems like I'm not the only one
who could use a drink.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.792
Trying to avoid
the entire manor?

35:42.836 --> 35:44.751
Or just your husband?

35:44.794 --> 35:47.580
Hearing all of that stuff about
Blake in court wasn't easy.

35:47.623 --> 35:50.887
He may have done
all of those things to...

35:50.931 --> 35:53.238
and with other women,

35:53.281 --> 35:55.501
but I'm the idiot still
married to him.

35:55.544 --> 35:58.156
And I'm the idiot living
in his carriage house

35:58.199 --> 36:00.158
when I swore to myself

36:00.201 --> 36:03.073
I wouldn't get six feet

36:03.117 --> 36:04.684
from Blake Carrington.

36:05.554 --> 36:06.816
People change.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.253
Do they?

36:08.296 --> 36:09.776
Look at Alexis.

36:09.819 --> 36:12.082
I said people, not succubi.

36:12.126 --> 36:15.521
I have a beautiful relationship
with my children

36:15.564 --> 36:18.263
because they were able
to see past

36:18.306 --> 36:21.004
the woman I was

36:21.048 --> 36:23.920
and accept me
for the woman I am today.

36:23.964 --> 36:26.184
I think you owe it
to your marriage

36:26.227 --> 36:28.447
to offer Blake the same grace.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.628
It's NordicStar.

36:35.671 --> 36:36.977
Answer it.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.200
Hello?

36:43.853 --> 36:45.594
Yes.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.596
I understand.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.598
Of course.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.079
Thank you for calling.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.476
After the trial, there was

36:57.519 --> 37:00.609
a last-minute uptick
in votes for me.

37:02.785 --> 37:05.484
I won the NordicStar contract.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.182
I won
the NordicStar contract.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.272
Don't worry,
it's sparkling cider.

37:11.316 --> 37:12.839
Vintage, of course.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.449
To Anders.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.625
Still one step ahead of us,
even from his grave.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.976
May we soon find
a worthy replacement.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.718
Hear, hear.

37:22.762 --> 37:24.894
Mmm.

37:24.938 --> 37:28.202
Hey, if Anders believed
that I was guilty

37:28.246 --> 37:30.683
and was trying to protect me,
why didn't he just

37:30.726 --> 37:33.033
- destroy the note?
- About that.

37:33.076 --> 37:35.470
This is less of a diary

37:35.514 --> 37:37.907
and more of a detailed record

37:37.951 --> 37:39.996
of all the horrible things
you've ever done.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.347
He left it for me
as insurance.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.957
But please don't be mad at him.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.785
You were never supposed
to find out about it,

37:45.828 --> 37:47.613
unless, of course,
you turned on me.

37:47.656 --> 37:50.268
I would expect nothing less
from the old goat.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.446
I just hope that Alexis
didn't make a copy for herself.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.709
Don't worry about her. We had
a great chat after court,

37:56.752 --> 37:58.580
and if anything from this book
ever gets out, Amanda's

37:58.624 --> 38:01.017
gonna find out about every
crime she aided and abetted.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.324
You guys were married
for a shockingly long time.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.021
Don't remind me.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.632
How'd you get
the book back from her?

38:06.675 --> 38:09.025
Culhane remembered finding
a secret hiding place

38:09.069 --> 38:10.723
under a floorboard
that Alexis had installed

38:10.766 --> 38:12.464
when he was living
in the carriage house.

38:12.507 --> 38:15.162
Turns out, she had an identical
one in the penthouse.

38:15.205 --> 38:17.512
Well, I guess you really can't
teach an old bitch new tricks.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.601
Culhane also made me promise

38:19.645 --> 38:22.561
that if he helped me,
I would burn the book for good.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.302
No arguments from me.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.877
No more secrets.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.363
This is normally the part
where I'd apologize

38:42.407 --> 38:44.147
for doubting you.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.149
Somehow I feel like that's
not going to happen.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.369
Well, frankly, you don't
have the best track record

38:48.413 --> 38:50.502
as a father
or truth-teller,

38:50.545 --> 38:54.114
so I'd be a little bit of
an idiot not to doubt you.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.595
But that was then,

38:56.638 --> 38:59.032
and you turned out
to be a, uh...

38:59.075 --> 39:00.990
mostly okay dad.

39:01.034 --> 39:03.950
My point is,
we can't change the past.

39:03.993 --> 39:06.866
We can only do our best
with today and tomorrow.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.259
Hopefully I can do better
this next round

39:09.303 --> 39:12.741
and be someone your child is
proud to call Pop-Pop.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.308
My child is
never calling you that.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.962
Proudly or otherwise.

39:16.005 --> 39:18.530
Yeah, it felt wrong
as soon as I said it.

39:20.227 --> 39:22.664
There he is!

39:22.708 --> 39:24.449
I just came by to
say you're a champ.

39:24.492 --> 39:27.103
I'm not sure how you got
a coherent piece of writing

39:27.147 --> 39:29.671
out of Jasper so quickly,
but I'm grateful.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.456
His submission is in.

39:31.499 --> 39:34.197
Glad to hear it. By any chance,
did you read his story?

39:34.241 --> 39:37.505
I did. Let's just say I'm glad
Jasper has other interests.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.289
Really?

39:39.333 --> 39:42.031
I-I don't know, I didn't
think it was that bad.

39:42.075 --> 39:43.642
It was fine.
It was absolutely pedestrian

39:43.685 --> 39:45.426
and unremarkable in every way.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.298
You performed a miracle
to even get him that far.

39:48.342 --> 39:50.910
Jasper just doesn't have
that special spark.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.434
Hey, why don't we get a jump
on those ideas you mentioned?

39:53.478 --> 39:55.305
I'm dying for a Scotch and soda.

39:55.349 --> 39:58.352
Yeah, actually, I think I...
sort of want to let things

39:58.396 --> 40:00.310
percolate a little longer.

40:00.354 --> 40:01.921
Yeah, you know, I just got
to make sure that I still have

40:01.964 --> 40:03.749
that "special spark."Not a problem.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.099
Whenever you're ready,
you know where to find me.

40:07.666 --> 40:11.757
Hi.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.455
Are we okay? Today was...

40:14.499 --> 40:16.501
weird.

40:18.024 --> 40:20.243
It wasn't easy

40:20.287 --> 40:22.550
hearing about your past,

40:22.594 --> 40:25.466
but your sister helped me
see things clearly.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.773
Dominique argued my case?

40:27.816 --> 40:30.471
Wait, you know what,
never mind. I'm grateful.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.956
Ben, thank you for coming.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.437
- Hey, have a seat.
- I'd rather stand.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.048
So why did you summon me
to the castle?

40:42.091 --> 40:44.006
Hoping to frame me
for another crime

40:44.050 --> 40:45.443
I didn't commit,
or just to gloat?

40:45.486 --> 40:46.748
The opposite.
As a matter of fact,

40:46.792 --> 40:48.054
I've got a proposal for you.

40:49.185 --> 40:51.840
I can't change the past,
but I can change

40:51.884 --> 40:54.016
how we go forward from here.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.105
I want you to move back
to Atlanta with your family.

40:56.149 --> 40:58.194
We can start fresh, rebuild.

40:58.238 --> 41:00.066
I have a lot of friends
in the art world.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.720
I could help you find a job.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.852
Blake Carrington
as the benevolent benefactor,

41:03.896 --> 41:06.159
ladies and gentlemen.
Thanks, but I'll be fine.

41:06.202 --> 41:07.987
After all, I've had
to survive for years

41:08.030 --> 41:09.075
without
Carrington resources.

41:09.118 --> 41:10.511
I'm scrappy.

41:10.555 --> 41:11.599
I'm just trying
to make things right.

41:11.643 --> 41:12.644
Wouldn't it be nice

41:12.687 --> 41:13.993
if your baby and Fallon's
grew up

41:14.036 --> 41:15.864
side-by-side,
as close as we once were?

41:15.908 --> 41:17.562
You should've thought of that
before you convinced yourself

41:17.605 --> 41:19.389
and everyone else
that I'm the kind of man

41:19.433 --> 41:21.304
who would let our mother die.

41:21.348 --> 41:22.697
You can go to hell.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.005
Take Fallon's spawn with you.

41:29.574 --> 41:32.359
You may be better
at gin or chess,

41:32.402 --> 41:34.840
but those are
just games.

41:34.883 --> 41:38.191
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

41:38.234 --> 41:40.019
And if you think
you've won,

41:40.062 --> 41:43.326
you're dumber than you look.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.637
Hey, Stacey, we're back!

41:49.681 --> 41:52.118
Just wanted to check on you
and my baby before we...

41:53.598 --> 41:55.513
Welcome home.
