The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.586 --> 00:05.523
Commander Waterford, you have
now crossed into Canada.

00:05.547 --> 00:06.628
We are arresting you...

00:06.715 --> 00:08.172
Serena! She's done
nothing wrong!

00:08.258 --> 00:09.777
...for war crimes
and crimes of aggression

00:09.801 --> 00:11.801
in violation of international
human rights treaties

00:11.845 --> 00:13.632
and international law.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.056
You should go.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.053
- Eleanor!
- You were raped because of him!

00:18.143 --> 00:22.057
I need him now.
I have a plan, Eleanor.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.355
Are you Billy?
You have access to a cargo plane.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.793
- You want a ride.
- Not for me.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.729
For Beth
and a Commander and his wife.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.606
And 52 children.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.525
- So you'll do it?
- Maybe.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.320
Ofjoseph. It is you.
Let's talk.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.073
Sit down.
Take off your panties.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.498
You bitch!

00:58.517 --> 01:00.634
Hey.
There's a service elevator

01:00.727 --> 01:02.810
at the end of the hall,
on the left.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.387
They grabbed me in Chicago.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.222
I saw you, at the cages.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.397
You saved me.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.563
Godspeed.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.103
They'll be coming for us.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.500
<i>First,</i>

02:08.586 --> 02:10.169
<i>you hear the van.</i>

02:14.217 --> 02:15.583
<i>Pulling up.</i>

02:16.678 --> 02:18.135
<i>Tires on the driveway.</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:22.014
<i>Doors closing.</i>

02:24.603 --> 02:26.060
<i>Voices.</i>

02:27.022 --> 02:28.308
<i>Footsteps.</i>

02:34.946 --> 02:38.155
<i>Then, boots on the stairs.</i>

02:41.828 --> 02:43.035
<i>Boots.</i>

02:45.123 --> 02:46.159
<i>Coming.</i>

02:51.838 --> 02:53.249
Oh!

02:53.882 --> 02:54.882
You scared me.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.173
I'm sorry.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.927
There are people downstairs.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.643
Men... with Joseph.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.110
What do they want?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.405
Joseph said just coffee
and sandwiches.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.619
Beth might need help.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.998
Yes, ma'am.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.548
Go!

03:36.425 --> 03:38.883
And you should...
you should leave that here.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.474
And then what?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.518
Are you familiar with
the idea that it is easier

03:49.604 --> 03:52.938
to get into a shooting war
than it is to get out of it?

03:53.024 --> 03:54.481
We have
to make a response.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.276
We need to be patient
and then make a response.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.356
So, you...
You're drawing conclusions?

04:01.450 --> 04:03.290
We've confirmed the reports.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.033
It's an act of aggression.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.910
- Blessed day.
- Blessed day.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.046
Can I help you?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.179
I think you get a day off,
after last night.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.509
Very impressive.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.810
What does that mean?

04:31.354 --> 04:33.016
You're fucking fantastic.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.689
Billy's in.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.567
Flight's a week from today.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.343
- Who's in there with Lawrence?
- Commanders.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.925
They've got some big bug
up their asses.

05:11.937 --> 05:14.224
One of them wants to
launch an attack.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.351
"Teach them a lesson,"
he keeps saying.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.024
I'll take the tray in.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.299
The Canadians
have shown their hand.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.734
We need to respond.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.280
Canada
is holding them,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.362
but the Americans
are behind this.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.282
- Sienna busy, is she?
- Yes, sir.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.210
We need troops on
the border to send a signal.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.082
Look at you.
Salivating.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.630
He's presenting
to the Council of War.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.957
We're planning to meet today.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.839
Ah. Did they have
a meeting to plan the meeting?

05:45.929 --> 05:48.888
You joke, when it's open season
on Commanders?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.993
Now that those two
are out of the picture,

05:51.017 --> 05:52.017
you come to me?

05:52.102 --> 05:55.561
We need a voice
of reason and restraint.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.479
You still have
a lot of support.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.274
Yet I've been stripped
of my high-level clearance.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.754
It's just politics.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.778
I see.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.822
Given the circumstances,
that can be restored.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.942
Or just hide here
with your books.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.321
Business as usual.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.994
Show some respect!

06:14.833 --> 06:16.244
Forgive me, sir.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.830
I spent the whole night
at the hospital...

06:20.589 --> 06:21.830
with my son.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.499
How is the little guy?

06:25.135 --> 06:27.923
He's tough.
All three pounds of him.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.172
Oh, praise be.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.637
Gentlemen, I thank you
for the briefing,

06:33.727 --> 06:37.346
but now... I need to mull.

06:42.694 --> 06:43.980
Under His eye.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.604
You might be the only one
happy about this.

06:46.698 --> 06:47.734
Blessed day.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.876
- Blessed day, sir.
- Blessed day.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.089
Well...

07:06.718 --> 07:08.084
you're off the hook.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.966
Or off the wall,
I should say. For now.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.092
What happened?

07:12.182 --> 07:15.971
Lucky for you,
they think Winslow's just missing.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.390
They got taken in a plot
by those tricky Americans.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.724
Taken?

07:24.361 --> 07:26.227
Captured? Snatched?

07:26.988 --> 07:28.104
Like the Waterfords?

07:30.742 --> 07:33.359
Who are now in custody
in Toronto.

07:35.622 --> 07:40.333
They went rogue,
expecting to get your baby back.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.000
But they were ambushed.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.128
They're...

07:45.006 --> 07:46.622
They're in prison?

07:46.716 --> 07:49.083
Facing trial
as war criminals.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.881
I guess they didn't bring
52 kids with them.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.054
What is the deal
with the plane?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.606
- A week.
- Can't come soon enough.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.774
Yes, sir.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.521
Cheer up.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.450
Fred and Serena are toast,
and you just...

08:15.245 --> 08:16.736
got away with murder.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.322
All in all,
not a bad morning.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.068
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

09:52.092 --> 09:54.129
<i>There's a special
on canned peaches.</i>

09:54.219 --> 09:56.302
<i>Limit of four cans
per household.</i>

09:56.387 --> 09:57.628
<i>Praise be.</i>

10:02.477 --> 10:04.877
It's happening, a week from today.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.058
- For real?
- Number 20's next.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.148
What now?

10:08.233 --> 10:10.941
Marthas will bring the kids
to the Lawrence house after dark.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.893
Then he'll get them
to the plane.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.027
Amherst is too far.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.359
Dylan?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.704
Do you trust your Martha?

10:24.916 --> 10:27.579
Yeah.
She's a bitch, but yeah.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.581
Have her get a message
to his house.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.871
- You have to try.
- Twenty-one.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.004
Hey. You'll always
be his mother.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.544
You know that.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.144
Twenty-two.
Number 22.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.018
Here you are.
That's two tokens.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.352
<i>Blessed day.</i>

10:57.407 --> 10:59.569
<i>Just a reminder to stay
within eyesight of</i>

10:59.659 --> 11:01.025
<i>your walking partner.</i>

11:01.119 --> 11:02.155
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:04.747 --> 11:07.330
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.540
Wait till you hear.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.962
I've heard.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.588
Can you believe it?

11:19.262 --> 11:21.754
I can't stop imagining them
in orange jumpsuits.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.641
The Eyes came to ask me
what I knew.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.060
What'd you say?

11:32.150 --> 11:34.858
That Serena left,
excited to be with the baby.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.025
She was nice to me

11:36.112 --> 11:37.319
when she said goodbye.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.069
She's only nice when
she's up to something.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.871
I heard what the Marthas
are planning.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.419
I told them that I want in.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.001
Escort a kid. Whatever.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.096
Is this your idea?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.261
Such a boss now.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.781
I'm proud of you.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.908
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

13:09.998 --> 13:10.998
No, of course not.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.351
Tell them you've done
nothing wrong.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.477
You played
no part in any of it.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.787
Fred, don't say anything
to them.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.313
God help me,
I'll get you out of here.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.420
Listen, we don't have
much time.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.747
Listen to me.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.629
Don't give them anything that
they can use against you at the trial.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.927
It won't get that far. Gilead
will demand our release.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.595
Oh, but you must be smart.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.010
This could mean
life in prison.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.516
Or it could mean extradition

13:34.605 --> 13:36.096
somewhere that they could...

13:38.192 --> 13:39.399
Look at me.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.697
I won't let anything
happen to you.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.617
Shh.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.165
You have to stop worrying
about me now.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.588
You have to save yourself.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.882
I'll be fine.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.346
What?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.308
What have you done?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.231
What have you done?

14:27.658 --> 14:29.650
I want to be with my daughter.

14:35.917 --> 14:36.917
How could you?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.708
I...

14:38.795 --> 14:41.663
Please, try to understand me.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.756
It's always been about you.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.086
What you want, what you need.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.796
No, she needs me!
My daughter needs me!

14:52.809 --> 14:55.472
I pity the child
that has you as her mother.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.104
I will pray for you, Fred.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.028
Mrs. Lawrence?
What's wrong?

15:54.245 --> 15:58.034
I just... needed a moment.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.580
I should go back.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.376
Joseph would want me to.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.426
I'll go with you.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.218
You're always so good to me.

16:17.935 --> 16:22.145
Hear us, O Lord, for You are
our help and our comfort.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.473
Come in, my love.

16:25.443 --> 16:29.653
Ofjoseph. Let us pray for
Commander Winslow's safety.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.533
Dear Lord, we pray
that You watch over him

16:34.619 --> 16:37.032
and give him strength
in the presence of danger.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.247
Amen.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.932
- Amen.
- Amen.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.325
Amen.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.410
Thank you for your kindness.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.864
Are there
any leads at all?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.713
None that I've heard of.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.335
I'm so afraid
for my children.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.591
Your children?

16:56.140 --> 16:58.302
Of course. Of course.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.518
May God watch over
Commander Winslow.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.892
Wherever he is.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.018
You will pray
for his safe return.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.936
I will do that, Mrs. Winslow.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.944
By God's grace, George will be
home with you soon.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.285
But the other Commanders
are focused on politics.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.739
Just an excuse
to blow things up.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.957
Boys will be boys.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.579
Please, Commander.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.583
Help me get George back.

17:29.674 --> 17:33.714
I can't be a woman alone
with six children.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.794
They'll take them away.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.013
We could take them with us.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.722
Don't... Don't we have room?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.269
Room here?

17:45.106 --> 17:46.597
Of course. Of course.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.978
All the children can come.
We can save all of them.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.185
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

17:54.782 --> 17:56.398
God bless you, both.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.859
Hopefully things
won't get that far.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.579
They sent the Eyes
to question Warren and me.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.252
As if we'd know anything
about Fred and Serena.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.579
Poor things.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.835
At least
we know where they are.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.422
Empty your pockets.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.220
All loose items.
Bags and purses.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.641
How did this happen?
We're the danger?

18:23.311 --> 18:24.722
Protecting them from us?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.223
The notebook, sir.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.097
Yeah.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.522
Ah! Ready?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.602
Ma'am, that stroller
needs to go through the machine.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.176
It's all right.
It's all right.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.859
Do you want the kid, too?

18:37.617 --> 18:40.325
Could be packing heat.
Baby assassin.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.494
Do not joke.
They won't let us in.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.741
Good. We shouldn't be here.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.823
Fold the stroller.
Hold the child.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.709
Hey.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.831
Okay.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.959
It's part of the deal,
all right?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.540
It'll be worth it
to see 'em in here.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.964
I'm chill.
All right? You be chill.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.627
- I am chill.
- You too.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.259
Oh, for...

19:06.771 --> 19:08.228
Sorry, I got my, um...

19:08.773 --> 19:11.641
You'll be given badges.
Wear them at all times.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.154
- Good morning.
- Morning.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.699
I thought I had
the wrong room for a second.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.876
How many other women
are imprisoned here?

20:12.962 --> 20:14.453
You've been detained

20:14.547 --> 20:17.210
until we finish the process
with the Commander.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.254
How'd he take it?

20:22.138 --> 20:23.629
As you can imagine.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.015
Well, he's not
your concern anymore.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.391
He's my husband.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.024
Sorry.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.070
I know this
has been difficult.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.859
But look to the future.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.407
She's here.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.661
Okay. I'm ready.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.577
Mrs. Waterford,

20:54.670 --> 20:56.627
this is Bonnie Pincus
from Social Services.

20:56.714 --> 20:59.798
- Hello.
- Blessed day. Uh, hello.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.506
And, um, Moira Strand.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.976
It's nice to meet you.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.264
I'm June's friend.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.320
Uh, thank you so much
for bringing Nichole here...

21:22.406 --> 21:23.647
June's daughter.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.161
So, Moira will stay
in the waiting room

21:30.247 --> 21:31.783
while you have your visit.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.359
I'm gonna be back.
You're gonna have a good visit.

21:36.754 --> 21:40.498
Then I'm gonna pick you up and take you home. In an hour.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.757
We all know the terms.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.298
Excuse me.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.095
I put some diapers
and stuff in her bag,

21:48.182 --> 21:51.892
and if she gets cranky,
just give her Herman.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.139
I'm sure that she will
be fine with me.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.139
Who are you, really?

21:57.233 --> 21:58.895
- Moira...
- No.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.962
Just because you got
some new clothes

22:00.986 --> 22:02.978
doesn't make you
any different.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.814
Right?

22:06.784 --> 22:10.573
You are still the same woman
who held my friend down

22:10.663 --> 22:12.074
so your husband
could rape her.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.201
- That's uncalled for.
- Fuck you.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.745
You know, he raped me, too,

22:21.674 --> 22:23.131
at the whorehouse.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.757
Treated me like shit, like I was worthless.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.556
Look, I am who I am, and I...

22:32.852 --> 22:34.093
have sinned plenty.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.725
But you, you are
the gender traitor.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.474
Nichole, I'll be back soon.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.739
Oh.

22:56.667 --> 22:57.953
You're okay.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.581
You're okay. It's okay.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.549
Just a little
stranger anxiety.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.631
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.009
It's okay.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.730
It's your momma.
Hey, Nichole.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.853
Mrs. Waterford,
you can't use terms like that.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.434
You'll confuse her.

23:30.951 --> 23:34.695
It's okay.
I know. I know.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.285
I said,
"And then what?"

23:42.254 --> 23:45.497
Am I not making myself clear?
What happens next?

23:45.591 --> 23:49.676
What is the end game?
Is it... Is it World War III?

23:49.762 --> 23:52.755
Do you understand that it's easier
to get into a conflict

23:52.848 --> 23:54.555
than it is
to get out of one?

23:54.642 --> 23:57.635
Do you understand the concept of
unintended consequ...

23:58.604 --> 24:01.517
No, you cannot
close the border.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.940
The effect that it will
have on trade?

24:05.027 --> 24:07.519
Have you thought about that?
It will strangle us.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.798
No, you know how to speak,
you tell 'em.

24:10.866 --> 24:11.982
Idiot.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.118
I should put a bell
around your neck.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.166
Trouble?

24:21.251 --> 24:24.460
Just a bunch of blowhards
with itchy trigger fingers.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.665
They may close the border.
Move up our departure date.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.505
It doesn't work
like that, sir.

24:31.595 --> 24:32.961
Yeah, well, make it work.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.255
The plane is on a weekly schedule.
It has to look legit.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.424
Okay.
We're... We're stuck?

24:37.518 --> 24:39.638
No, you need to convince them
to keep the border open.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.472
Sweetheart?
Where are you going?

24:44.566 --> 24:45.773
The Salengers' house.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.259
There's that sweet
little boy David.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.400
We can get him out.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.814
Mrs. Lawrence, it's okay.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.399
You don't have
to do that, okay?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.012
'Cause we're taking care
of all of that.

24:56.036 --> 24:59.655
But there's that blonde girl
that lives down the street?

24:59.748 --> 25:01.330
- I can tell her parents.
- No.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.727
They have no idea...

25:02.751 --> 25:04.020
You're not gonna
tell her parents.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.161
- Come with me.
- Hannah! What about Hannah?

25:06.255 --> 25:08.963
The Mackenzies have moved,
and I don't know where she is!

25:09.049 --> 25:10.652
But the children!
What about the other children?

25:10.676 --> 25:13.259
- Let's go back to that school...
- Stop it! Stop it!

25:13.345 --> 25:14.739
- Watch who you're talking to.
- Stop!

25:14.763 --> 25:16.283
No, you should've kept
your mouth shut!

25:17.808 --> 25:20.300
You cannot say anything!
Do you understand?

25:20.394 --> 25:21.680
You cannot!

25:22.563 --> 25:24.646
- Do you understand?
- Enough!

25:26.817 --> 25:28.149
Enough.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.029
No, Joseph, she's right.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.027
I...

25:36.035 --> 25:37.492
I wasn't thinking.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.286
Okay.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.369
I know.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.327
I'm sorry.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.215
Okay.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.922
Sweetheart.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.884
Sweetheart,
all you need to do...

26:04.897 --> 26:09.392
is to think about our life
when we are out of this place.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.228
- Our life.
- Yes, my love.

26:14.156 --> 26:17.024
We'll leave all this behind.
All of it.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.830
Can we really do that?

26:44.937 --> 26:46.257
Get some rest, my love.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.032
You poisoned her.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.198
Exploited her obsession
with that baby

27:03.288 --> 27:05.200
for this political theater.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.290
Commander Waterford,

27:06.375 --> 27:08.617
your wife is too smart
to be manipulated.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.417
You know her better
than anyone.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.338
Consider this an opportunity.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.837
For rest and relaxation?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.426
A chance to explain.

27:20.806 --> 27:24.140
The whole world is eager

27:24.226 --> 27:26.559
to hear from a man
of your stature.

27:28.522 --> 27:30.514
Help us understand Gilead.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.234
Manipulation won't work
for me either.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.316
Fair enough.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.153
Someone's asked
for a meeting.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.331
Luke Bankole.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.368
The guard will stay,
of course.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.872
He's here now?

27:56.550 --> 27:57.882
For a discussion.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.259
It's your call.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.427
Bring him in.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.605
Mr. Bankole,
Commander Waterford.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.399
I'll leave you both to it.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.081
Please.

28:36.173 --> 28:39.712
Can I offer you something?
Coffee? Tea? Bourbon?

28:39.801 --> 28:41.417
They've been
very accommodating.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.045
Yeah, I can see that.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.138
You've been busy.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.939
I know what you've done.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.812
It's all in here.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.061
We grew up the same.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.691
You know, good family.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.569
First-class education.

29:06.620 --> 29:07.986
A man of faith.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.365
Yet you destroy lives.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.707
I've saved lives...
Mr. Bankole.

29:20.884 --> 29:24.377
What did you do
when our values eroded?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.717
When the birth rate
was plummeting?

29:28.850 --> 29:29.850
Hmm?

29:31.687 --> 29:34.350
Stood by and let it happen.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.104
Maybe.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.652
But you're gonna rot
in this jail,

29:40.737 --> 29:42.729
knowing that your wife
betrayed you.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.199
What about your wife?

29:51.456 --> 29:53.948
All those years, wasted,

29:55.669 --> 29:57.752
praying she'll come back
to you.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.670
- She will come back to me.
- Maybe.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.471
But the June Osborn you knew
doesn't exist anymore.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.760
Gilead's changed her.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.854
I've changed her.

30:32.831 --> 30:33.867
I'm not done!

30:36.585 --> 30:38.167
I'm not done!

30:38.795 --> 30:40.286
I'm not done!

30:52.309 --> 30:53.675
Mrs. Lawrence?

30:59.858 --> 31:01.269
Mrs. Lawrence?

31:13.372 --> 31:14.533
Mrs. Lawrence.

31:20.462 --> 31:21.669
Eleanor?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.632
Eleanor?

31:27.427 --> 31:28.884
Eleanor, wake up.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.969
Eleanor.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.432
Eleanor, wake up.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.726
Eleanor, wake up!

31:40.816 --> 31:42.557
Wake up! Eleanor!

31:43.235 --> 31:44.942
Wake up! Shit!

36:08.458 --> 36:10.074
Mrs. Lawrence?

36:55.588 --> 36:57.921
The food is not
so hot here, so...

37:00.260 --> 37:03.253
Trust me,
Toronto's got great pizza.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.635
Isn't that contraband?

37:07.976 --> 37:10.684
That's why you'll have
to eat the evidence.

37:12.439 --> 37:15.022
Thank you. I'll try.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.946
There's a lot going on
in the world.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.783
There's an interesting piece
on media bias

37:29.873 --> 37:31.455
as pertains to religion.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.746
I'd love your thoughts
sometime.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.290
I'll have a read.

38:15.335 --> 38:17.247
Stack those plates
on the buffet.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.703
Make sure
they're not chipped.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.333
Breads came out nice.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.253
Let 'em cool.
We'll slice 'em after the service.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.520
These are for later.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.352
Get the rest
in the basement.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.523
Yes, sir.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.741
This one was her favorite.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.375
I was saving it
for our anniversary.

39:11.975 --> 39:15.764
Luke bought my favorite pinot
for our wedding.

39:16.646 --> 39:19.229
And he left it
in the car overnight,

39:19.816 --> 39:21.432
so the whole case froze.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.314
All the bottles shattered.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.701
I kept the border open...

39:36.082 --> 39:37.243
So...

39:46.426 --> 39:47.667
You convinced the Council?

39:50.096 --> 39:53.305
It's hard to argue with
a man who's in mourning.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.424
Even for them.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.769
Hmm.

40:01.941 --> 40:05.685
I'm very sorry,
Commander Lawrence.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.613
She was so fragile.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.451
I let her...

40:20.043 --> 40:22.330
I let her go to her room.

40:22.462 --> 40:25.205
No. No, don't do that.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.839
You cannot blame yourself.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.153
I could've checked on her.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.759
I could have checked on her.

40:33.598 --> 40:34.805
Okay?

40:47.695 --> 40:51.029
She was
a very kind woman.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.578
She was.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.518
In the name of God,

42:10.611 --> 42:14.901
we commit the body of Eleanor
to the peace of the grave.

42:16.325 --> 42:19.614
May the good Lord forgive her sins
and show mercy.

42:20.830 --> 42:24.540
May He welcome her
at the gates of heaven. Amen.

42:25.334 --> 42:26.791
Amen.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.129
Forgive us,
dear Lord, for our failings.

42:35.053 --> 42:38.342
For we did not
ease her pain,
