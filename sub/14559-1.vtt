WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:05.539
Previously on Numbers:
Dwayne Carter.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.807
We did a tour together
in Afghanistan.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.177
Your friend is bought and paid
for by the Chinese government.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.446
The man who saves your life--
you put him in jail.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.484
Things I could tell you about
squeaky-clean Colby Granger.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.419
If you find the Janus List,
trust it!

00:18.452 --> 00:19.420
(explosion)

00:19.453 --> 00:22.123
Ashby was building a Janus List.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.658
A master list of double agents
and traitors.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.194
ASHBY'S VOICE:
Welcome to the Janus List.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.062
The following people
have been co-opted.

00:28.096 --> 00:31.665
United States FBI agent
Colby Granger, by the Chinese.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.245
DON (on video): I mean, do you
understand

00:44.278 --> 00:45.779
what you're telling me?

00:45.813 --> 00:47.815
COLBY:
Nothing you don't know.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.252
Nothing everybody's not
going to know tomorrow.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.186
David...

00:52.220 --> 00:53.687
How long have you been lying to
us, huh?!

00:53.721 --> 00:54.488
DON: Just relax.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.523
COLBY: From the beginning,
David.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.690
That's what a spy does.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.858
You ain't
no damn spy!

00:57.891 --> 00:58.826
You're a traitor!

00:58.859 --> 01:00.394
All that crap about
serving your country!

01:00.428 --> 01:02.563
Get out of here!

01:02.596 --> 01:03.664
You ain't
no damn spy!

01:03.697 --> 01:05.199
You're a traitor!

01:05.233 --> 01:07.335
All that crap about
serving your country!

01:07.368 --> 01:08.436
Get out of here!

01:10.904 --> 01:13.774
DON:
Spying on your own country?

01:13.807 --> 01:16.177
I mean, do you understand
what you're telling me?

01:16.210 --> 01:18.579
*

01:18.612 --> 01:20.414
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

01:26.687 --> 01:29.657
(panicked shouting)

01:35.829 --> 01:37.131
This man,
do you know this man?

01:37.165 --> 01:39.133
*

01:39.167 --> 01:40.201
Do you know him?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.539
This man,
you know this man here?

01:47.441 --> 01:49.343
Yo, turn around!

01:51.345 --> 01:53.881
*

01:56.384 --> 01:57.818
You know him?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.522
I will put cases
on every one of you!

02:01.555 --> 02:03.224
Every one of you!

02:03.257 --> 02:04.592
How long have you been
lying to us, huh?

02:04.625 --> 02:05.226
Just relax.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.594
You ain't
no damn spy.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.928
You're a traitor.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.564
All that crap about
serving your country!

02:10.598 --> 02:11.899
Get out of here.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.405
COLBY: Dwayne Carter approached
me while I was in the Academy

02:17.438 --> 02:20.208
and asked if he could make
a copy of a training manual.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.810
It didn't seem like a big deal.

02:22.843 --> 02:27.415
You know, he'd ask for a file
or a pass code to a database.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.750
Before I knew it,
I was spying for the Chinese.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.424
It didn't seem like a big deal.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.260
You know, he'd ask for a file
or a pass code to a database.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.363
Before I knew it,
I was spying for the Chinese.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.798
CHARLIE: So consider the game of
chicken

02:44.832 --> 02:47.768
in which there are three
Nash equilibria.

02:47.801 --> 02:51.205
Each driver can choose to drive
straight at the other--

02:51.239 --> 02:52.706
consistent with
a rational strategy--

02:52.740 --> 02:54.408
and rationally crash.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.644
So game theorists recognized

02:56.677 --> 02:59.913
this conundrum during the 1950s
as we contemplated

02:59.947 --> 03:02.483
nuclear annihilation.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.452
Mathematical theory confirmed

03:04.485 --> 03:07.221
what we instinctively
understood-- that the sane man

03:07.255 --> 03:09.857
often operates
at a disadvantage.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.792
So what am I illustrating?

03:11.825 --> 03:14.995
I'm illustrating
the ability of math to do more

03:15.028 --> 03:17.731
than define the parameters
of our lives.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.533
It can illuminate
the human condition.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.970
And some day, perhaps,
it will even

03:23.003 --> 03:24.872
define what lives deepest
in our hearts.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.707
Okay?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.942
Tomorrow, however, we are going
to return to parameters.

03:28.976 --> 03:33.281
Specifically partition
congruences.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.582
All right, you guys are done.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.916
Enjoy the rest of your day.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.988
(clears throat)

03:41.021 --> 03:43.791
Oh, hey.
There you are. Hi.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.562
Your analysis of game theory
seems a little bleak.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.697
Oh.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.931
(laughing):
Yeah.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.866
And I noticed you
haven't been doing

03:52.900 --> 03:55.369
any consulting work
for the FBI.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.738
Well, Don hasn't
asked me, you know.

03:57.771 --> 04:01.609
Honestly, it's been kind of nice
getting back to teaching.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.911
Breathing.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.946
Kissing you.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.885
Before I knew it,
I was spying for the Chinese.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.457
DON:
Yeah? How did it feel?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.392
Spying on your own country?

04:19.627 --> 04:21.462
I didn't do it
because I believed

04:21.495 --> 04:24.298
in Communism or China.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.834
I did it because I could.

04:26.867 --> 04:27.901
Because after Afghanistan,

04:27.935 --> 04:31.271
I just didn't really believe
in much of anything.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.947
So, are you finding
your answers here?

04:39.980 --> 04:42.750
At least the monks and I are
asking the same questions.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.084
Hmm.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.953
Hey... Well, I'm
sure you know this.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.789
The Dobsonian telescope
owes its very existence

04:48.822 --> 04:50.991
to the hours
that John Dobson spent

04:51.024 --> 04:53.694
at the Vedanta Society
monastery.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.397
I did not know that.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.066
Oh, I just think I needed

04:59.099 --> 05:01.935
some kind of surcease
from the madness

05:01.969 --> 05:03.837
of daily obligations.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.008
You...

05:08.041 --> 05:10.077
to what do you
owe your respite?

05:10.110 --> 05:12.746
What makes you think
I'm taking a respite?

05:12.780 --> 05:15.583
Well, given the many hours
you've spent here,

05:15.616 --> 05:17.918
their distribution over
the past many weeks--

05:17.951 --> 05:19.186
I mean, it's highly doubtful

05:19.219 --> 05:23.090
that you could be maintaining
your official duties as well.

05:23.123 --> 05:27.795
I had some leave time coming
that I think I really needed.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.565
You know, with everything
that happened with Colby,

05:31.599 --> 05:34.502
and my work for the DOJ
before that...

05:34.535 --> 05:37.738
Still not at liberty
to discuss it?

05:39.440 --> 05:42.109
I'm not sure that I'm ready.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.144
You know, I...

05:44.177 --> 05:47.014
I feel like I've been
sleepwalking since I got back.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.017
I'm... I'm physically present,
but I'm somewhere else

05:50.050 --> 05:50.951
at the same time.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.954
You know,
I had a very similar experience

05:53.987 --> 05:55.789
on my first space walk.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.057
Just this sense of, oh--

05:57.090 --> 05:59.560
for want
of a more elegant term--

05:59.593 --> 06:02.396
quantum disconnectedness.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.698
And did it go away?

06:04.732 --> 06:08.402
Unfortunately, it did.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.671
Hmm.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.741
DON:
Who else was involved?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.609
Carter was my cutout.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.011
He never let me
near his handlers.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.948
ALAN:
Donny?

06:23.183 --> 06:26.119
Come on. It's been
five weeks.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.622
There's just something
about his confession.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.191
It just... doesn't
feel right.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.026
I mean, do you understand
what you're telling me?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.895
DON:
It just doesn't seem right.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.097
ALAN:
Like what?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.098
I don't know.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.934
Like, I didn't see it coming,
for one thing.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.636
Well, no one did.

06:42.670 --> 06:43.971
Come on.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.775
You got to allow yourself
a few mistakes in life.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.778
Yeah, well, people die that way.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.993
How's it been?

07:06.026 --> 07:08.562
Last chance to turn back.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.799
I've spent two years lying
to everybody about everything.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.434
Stop now, it's all for nothing.

07:17.938 --> 07:22.075
Expect something to happen
during the transfer.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.749
Take the guard's cell phone.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.186
Number six on the speed dial.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.726
Who else knows?

07:38.759 --> 07:41.061
Almost no one.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.163
So I'm alone.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.799
You got me.

07:46.166 --> 07:46.734
(sighs)

07:59.647 --> 08:01.148
(sighs)

08:04.184 --> 08:06.654
MAN (over radio):
Delta Three Niner,

08:06.687 --> 08:09.957
confirm for transpo
to secure facility two.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.661
(speaking Spanish)

08:13.694 --> 08:15.162
(man singing in Spanish
on radio)

08:15.195 --> 08:18.799
Any chance you got some
Johnny Cash up there?

08:18.832 --> 08:22.169
Seriously, I may be a traitor,
but at least I'm an American.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.271
Any of you guys
even got green cards?

08:24.304 --> 08:26.039
Dwayne, do you
ever shut up?

08:26.073 --> 08:27.675
Solitary for three weeks--

08:27.708 --> 08:29.176
conversation's
been a little thin.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.678
*

08:30.711 --> 08:32.212
Excuse me for being social.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.151
(tires squealing)

08:38.185 --> 08:40.187
(truck horn blares)

08:49.196 --> 08:50.798
(groans)

08:54.702 --> 08:56.904
Don't move,
or I'll blow your brains out!

08:56.937 --> 08:58.906
Dwayne, grab his gun.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.643
(indistinct yelling)

09:04.745 --> 09:06.580
Ride's here.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.548
(sirens wailing,
tires squealing)

09:18.025 --> 09:19.760
This ain't going our way,
Granger.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.261
We got to go.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.802
GRANGER:
Hey, get down!

09:28.836 --> 09:30.137
Don't move.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.762
WOMAN (on TV): We could see that
there was a fire or explosion

09:54.795 --> 09:55.462
of some sort.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.898
We're getting no confirmation...

09:57.931 --> 10:00.000
- Oh. Didn't hear you get up.
- Oh, hey.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.869
Well, you know,
since Millie's been on me

10:01.902 --> 10:04.838
to publish lately,
I thought I'd dust off some

10:04.872 --> 10:07.675
of my insights into Groebner
basis calculations.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.677
"A Mathematical Analysis
of Friendship Dynamics."

10:09.710 --> 10:12.012
Yeah, I figured
I could navigate

10:12.045 --> 10:13.781
through the 11th grade
using the minimax theorem

10:13.814 --> 10:14.982
and n-person games.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.383
Did it work?

10:16.416 --> 10:18.986
Actually, my insights
into the network externalities

10:19.019 --> 10:20.854
of school elections
were absolutely bulletproof.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.957
Payoff strategies for doing
other people's homework were not

10:23.991 --> 10:25.793
- quite as well reasoned.
- ALAN: I'm telling you.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.927
It's absolutely new.
I just bought it.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.996
I know, but this is, like,
your third one this year.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.798
With the shoes, which I
have to try on right now.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.199
Charlie, last chance.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.434
Oh, I-I... I love the game
of golf, but no.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.936
Thank you. We have
other plans, all right?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.370
All right, all right.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.372
Can I see this?
I still remember this.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.307
You remember it?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.008
Yeah, yeah,
the Friendship Math, right?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.242
- Wow. Yeah.
- That's right.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.043
Yeah, yeah.

10:43.076 --> 10:43.877
- I tried to read this.
- Really?

10:43.911 --> 10:46.279
- Yeah. I thought I could...
- Why?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.381
Uh, you know, I thought I could,
uh, pick up girls with it.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.249
Of course.

10:49.282 --> 10:49.917
What, it was, like, 11th grade,
right?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.351
Wow. Yeah.
(phone rings)

10:51.384 --> 10:52.786
11th grade.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.354
All right, Dad,
let's get out of here. Eppes.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.423
Oh, no.
They're going to be too small.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.725
DON:
What?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.126
When?

10:59.159 --> 11:00.227
Yeah, yeah, all right. Uh...

11:00.260 --> 11:01.361
Yeah.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.896
I'm on my way.
I got to go.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.031
ALAN:
Why? What's up?

11:04.064 --> 11:05.665
Dwayne Carter
and Colby just escaped.

11:06.266 --> 11:06.834
(pry bar clanging)

11:09.202 --> 11:11.171
There's gotta be
something in here.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.775
Where's my keys?
Where the hell are my keys?!

11:14.808 --> 11:16.777
You left them on the hook
in the kitchen.

11:18.779 --> 11:19.713
Charlie, I think you better
help him.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.816
Come on, you did this
before. What was it?

11:22.850 --> 11:23.683
Uh, chase curves, right?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.418
Pursuit curves,
and they're not really

11:25.452 --> 11:26.453
applicable here, Dad.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.924
Although, you know,
I have always suspected

11:30.958 --> 11:32.760
that the Set Covering
Deployment Problem

11:32.793 --> 11:34.762
could be an invaluable aid
in positioning police units...

11:34.795 --> 11:35.763
DON:
No, no, these aren't my keys!

11:35.796 --> 11:37.397
They're on the coffee table.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.933
MAN (on TV): ...there was a fire
or explosion of some sort.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.869
We're getting no confirmation
from the LAPD

11:41.902 --> 11:43.203
or the Department of Defense....

11:43.236 --> 11:45.739
CHARLIE:
It's potentially revolutionary.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.874
Now picture,

11:46.907 --> 11:48.208
uh, picture a coastline
at night.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.877
To keep ships from crashing
on the rocks,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.945
we build lighthouses, right?

11:51.979 --> 11:53.814
But lighthouses
are a limited resource

11:53.847 --> 11:55.949
because they cost time,
they cost money, materials.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.450
But using
Set Covering Deployment,

11:57.484 --> 11:59.920
we can determine
the best placement

11:59.953 --> 12:01.421
for our limited number
of lighthouses

12:01.454 --> 12:03.390
to illuminate the ocean.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.829
Put your ankle up here.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.397
Where did you get the key?

12:10.430 --> 12:13.033
Swallowed it right before
they busted me.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.869
Figured it was just
a matter of time.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.104
Standard-issue cuffs
use the same one.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.038
Give me this thing.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.477
I have to make a call.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.179
Use the phone right
in the office there.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.415
Right in there.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.053
No, it's me.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.521
Yeah, we need a ride.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.891
Now!

12:37.925 --> 12:38.926
Hold on.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.996
5th and Alvarado?

12:45.899 --> 12:48.235
We got a ride,
but we got to go

12:48.268 --> 12:50.037
- to 5th and Alvarado.
- All right.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.139
Hey, man, put on something
to cover that up.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.207
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.409
(siren wailing)

12:56.443 --> 12:57.410
Oh, man, I must've tripped the
alarm.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.013
- What?
- The cops!

13:00.047 --> 13:01.148
The alarm!

13:06.086 --> 13:08.055
Say, Mike, what do you got?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.322
Thanks.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.163
What's up, Megan?

13:16.196 --> 13:17.364
Thanks for coming back early.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.866
All right,
so what do we got?

13:18.899 --> 13:20.000
Carter and Granger
were being moved

13:20.033 --> 13:21.234
to a new holding facility.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.502
The transport
was ambushed en route.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.703
Driver hit the panic button.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.239
The response time was faster
than they probably expected.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.042
Which would explain why there's
two dead, a third in critical,

13:29.076 --> 13:32.412
and the fourth guy
was ID'd as Jimmy Hong Tran.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.914
What's that, like, Vietnamese?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.115
Yeah, he's a local mope.
He's not talking.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.283
Strictly hired muscle.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.051
Granger and Carter
used a diversion,

13:38.085 --> 13:39.252
overpowered the guards.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.521
They slipped away
during the firefight.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.423
Now, eyewitnesses saw them
taking off down Hill Street.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.158
They were shackled together
at the ankles.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.227
But the driver said
that Colby's hands were free,

13:47.260 --> 13:49.196
so they must have
gotten a key somehow.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.630
Yeah, it's right here.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.232
That explains
how they got loose.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.267
And if they lost it,

13:54.301 --> 13:57.104
why they're still
in leg shackles.

13:57.137 --> 14:00.173
Yeah, so they're gonna be trying
to cut those off, right?

14:05.312 --> 14:09.049
Charles, the monks
do not appreciate FBI agents

14:09.082 --> 14:10.483
knocking at their doors,

14:10.517 --> 14:12.285
especially during
morning contemplation.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.520
Yeah, I didn't have
any way to call you.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.754
Yes, by design.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.624
You know, much as I respect,
I've even embraced your work...

14:17.657 --> 14:19.159
Colby escaped from jail.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.931
All right.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.267
So you're programming a matrix
for Set Covering Deployment.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.237
It doesn't seem to be much use
for a cosmologist here.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.471
Plenty of use
for a friend, though.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.406
Look, intellectually, I know
that this case is no different

14:33.440 --> 14:34.507
than any other case
I've worked on--

14:34.541 --> 14:36.243
a problem needs to be solved.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.644
And, as in every case,

14:37.677 --> 14:39.012
there is a human component.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.014
In this instance,
a personal component.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.015
I can't reconcile

14:42.049 --> 14:44.217
what I know about the man
with his actions.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.253
Try as I might
to put that out of my head.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.354
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Charles.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.557
You ignore any reality,
no matter how uncomfortable,

14:50.590 --> 14:52.225
only at your own risk.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.361
But on the other hand,
you incorporate it,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.129
and I don't know,
who knows what insight

14:56.163 --> 14:57.965
might rise up here
from the depths.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.934
I'm not sorry I dragged you
out of bed, Larry.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.031
*

15:44.544 --> 15:47.180
They lost the key,
they cut the link.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.217
It looks like one of them
is still wearing a belt.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.552
They made a call. Tried to.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.189
Well, I can get a dump
on the phone line.

15:56.223 --> 15:56.689
Yeah.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.494
DAVID:
All right. Hey.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.330
LAPD lost them
in a back alley,

16:03.363 --> 16:05.732
but thinks they might've ducked
into the farmer's market.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.933
Why are we doing this?

16:06.966 --> 16:11.171
We're acting like this is
any other case, and it isn't.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.240
What do we do? Go home,
leave it for somebody else?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.375
No, I think we got to address

16:15.408 --> 16:17.244
what we're feeling
'cause it's affecting the work.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.213
I'm feeling like I'd really like
to put them back in prison.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.116
Sure you're up
for this?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.217
Hey, that's
not fair.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.285
That's not what I said.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.387
What do you want
me to say?

16:27.420 --> 16:28.255
How do I feel?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.223
I feel like it's my fault.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.458
That Colby's my responsibility.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.615
We move the foot patrols

16:55.648 --> 16:56.683
into the unknown
occupancy grids.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.585
Won't that compromise

16:58.618 --> 17:00.687
the coverage
in the central zone?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.790
Okay, how about
a terrain guarding algorithm?

17:03.823 --> 17:05.392
(phone ringing)

17:05.425 --> 17:08.061
It's always terrain guarding
algorithms with you.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.796
Hey. Charlie Eppes.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.398
Charlie, it's Colby.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.141
COLBY:
I need to talk to Don.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.475
CHARLIE (on phone):
Then why call me?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.744
Because the FBI doesn't have
enough time to trace me

17:24.777 --> 17:25.478
through your phone, Charlie.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.813
Look, think like
a mathematician.

17:26.846 --> 17:27.814
Is there any reason

17:27.847 --> 17:29.382
not to put me through to Don?

17:29.416 --> 17:30.550
Uh, no.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.185
It's Colby.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.686
I got to call you back.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.160
What, you call my brother?
Is this a threat?

17:40.193 --> 17:43.530
Don, my handler is
Agent Michael Kirkland,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.398
counterintelligence out of DC.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.500
Your handler?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.539
Look, when Dwayne first came
to me back at Quantico,

17:52.572 --> 17:53.873
I reported it.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.875
Kirkland has been
using me to feed

17:55.908 --> 17:58.578
cherry-picked information
through Dwayne to the Chinese

17:58.611 --> 18:00.313
because he's sure
that Carter's working

18:00.347 --> 18:02.282
for someone high up at the DOJ.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.416
Who's that?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.252
That's the thing, Don,
we haven't flushed him out yet.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.255
When Carter got busted,
Kirkland figured if I got thrown

18:08.288 --> 18:11.158
in jail with him and escaped
with him, that was our only shot

18:11.191 --> 18:12.725
that he might lead me up.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.394
But the problem is,

18:14.427 --> 18:16.229
I can't get ahold
of Kirkland right now.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.198
I don't know if something's
happened to him

18:18.231 --> 18:19.466
or if I'm being set up.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.633
Who else can verify this?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.602
The ranking guard
on the transport.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.471
Other than that,
Don, I-I don't know.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.474
Kirkland kept this whole op
extremely contained.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.143
Colby, you're giving me a story
here I can't even check out.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.611
I'm giving you Kirkland, Don.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.446
Okay, you don't trust me.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.648
I get that, all right?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.650
But you have to understand
that I trust you.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.752
The fact is, you are

18:39.786 --> 18:41.621
the only person
that I can trust right now.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.329
So DC says there is

18:49.362 --> 18:51.298
a Michael Kirkland
in counterintelligence,

18:51.331 --> 18:53.566
and he's been in North Hollywood
for the past six weeks.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.735
Any number of ways Granger
could've known that.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.304
It could be a name he sold to
the Chinese.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.438
So you go talk to him, all
right?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.241
But, uh, let's just keep this
among ourselves, okay?

19:01.274 --> 19:02.242
We're not going

19:02.275 --> 19:03.910
to report contact
with an escaped prisoner?

19:03.943 --> 19:06.179
No, I just want to find
out what Colby gains

19:06.213 --> 19:07.514
by telling us this story,
you know?

19:07.547 --> 19:08.548
MEGAN:
Because you think

19:08.581 --> 19:10.183
he could be telling the truth?

19:10.217 --> 19:12.585
Any of you familiar
with trust metrics?

19:12.619 --> 19:16.256
Uh, sure, in psychology,
it's a measure

19:16.289 --> 19:18.858
of how much a member of a group
is trusted by the other members.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.361
We can't trust
anything Colby says.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.197
Well, it's not
an either-or proposition

19:24.231 --> 19:25.565
if we employ a fuzzy system.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.236
Yes, I am done with that.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.904
Now, how would we describe
this ice cube?

19:31.938 --> 19:35.375
Wet, hard, cold.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.709
But none of those words
mean anything

19:36.743 --> 19:39.679
unless we have a basis
for comparison.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.681
Using fuzzy logic, we create
a range of those states,

19:41.714 --> 19:45.285
and assign the ice cube
values accordingly.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.586
Similarly, a person's honesty

19:46.619 --> 19:48.621
is not absolute;
we all lie

19:48.655 --> 19:50.523
to varying degrees
for varying reasons.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.292
DON: So what, you're going to
tell us what percentage

19:52.325 --> 19:53.393
to believe him?

19:53.426 --> 19:54.994
More like a probabilistic
statement.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.263
Let me do the work.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.897
If you guys don't
want to use it,

19:57.930 --> 19:58.931
then at least I tried.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.800
Charlie, don't you really
have your hands full

20:00.833 --> 20:03.303
trying to figure out
their possible escape routes?

20:03.336 --> 20:04.871
Actually,
my Set Covering Deployment

20:04.904 --> 20:07.274
yielded a very interesting
byproduct.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.942
AMITA: So we created a dynamic,
adaptive system

20:09.976 --> 20:13.446
adjusting for crowds,

20:13.480 --> 20:15.448
911 calls and
suspicious activities.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.884
Yeah, of course, it must seem
all fairly abstract to you.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.886
No, no, no, I get it;
the thicker lines are higher

20:19.919 --> 20:21.788
probabilities, right?

20:21.821 --> 20:24.957
We start where they escaped,
take them to the garage.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.294
Why do the subway stations
have lower values?

20:27.327 --> 20:28.761
Coverage-- there are police

20:28.795 --> 20:30.363
on the station stairs
and platforms.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.998
DON:
Yeah, but not all the trains.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.301
If they disappeared here...

20:36.636 --> 20:39.906
And they haven't
shown up here, right? Yeah!

20:39.939 --> 20:43.376
Well, well, Don has gotten
much better at the math.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.313
He puts on a good game face,
but he seems like he's hurting.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.315
Well, it's hard enough
Colby betrayed him,

20:48.348 --> 20:50.450
and now,
even more confusion

20:50.483 --> 20:52.285
about who he is
and what he's doing.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.920
You know something,
we might do well to consider

20:53.953 --> 20:56.589
a strange neutral B meson here.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.325
Okay.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.926
If something as simple as...

20:59.959 --> 21:02.295
as a heavy bottom
antiquark bound

21:02.329 --> 21:03.930
with a strange quark can

21:03.963 --> 21:06.699
reverse its identity
three million times a second,

21:06.733 --> 21:10.437
how do we expect something
as complex as the human mind

21:10.470 --> 21:12.805
to simply remain unchanged?

21:22.482 --> 21:24.684
Colby!

21:24.717 --> 21:27.487
Don't move!

21:27.520 --> 21:29.021
Colby!

21:29.055 --> 21:30.189
Don't move!

21:34.060 --> 21:36.363
Colby!
(train horn blowing)

21:36.396 --> 21:38.865
Colby, Carter, freeze!

21:38.898 --> 21:40.933
Carter!

22:03.856 --> 22:05.758
Ah, damn it!

22:07.860 --> 22:09.862
I let Colby go.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.532
Oh, come on, man,
you didn't let him...

22:12.565 --> 22:13.766
But we do have to assume that

22:13.800 --> 22:16.569
he's moved beyond the boundaries
of my Set Deployment by now.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.871
I let him get away. I had him.
I was looking right at him.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.973
All right.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.043
Were you basing your decision
on his statement,

22:24.076 --> 22:26.145
the circumstantial context,

22:26.178 --> 22:28.047
or a disposition towards

22:28.080 --> 22:29.115
giving him the benefit
of the doubt?

22:29.148 --> 22:31.518
What, are you actually putting
it in an equation?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.420
Well, of course, man.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.421
It factors
into my trust metric.

22:34.454 --> 22:38.024
I mean, I just, I don't
know why I believed him.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.660
Unless it's so simple
as I don't want to admit

22:40.693 --> 22:42.061
I was wrong in the first place.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.931
Don,

22:44.964 --> 22:47.734
- you have a big ego.
- Thanks.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.602
No, you have a ginormous ego.

22:49.636 --> 22:50.403
Thanks.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.704
But you're not
stupid, you know?

22:51.738 --> 22:53.606
You made the best decision
you could

22:53.640 --> 22:55.542
with all the available
information you had.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.545
And if past performance
is any indicator, man...

22:58.578 --> 23:01.047
you are probabilistically right.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.482
Probabilistically, huh?

23:02.515 --> 23:05.452
I know math is full
of absolutes, and...

23:05.485 --> 23:09.088
unfortunately,
the rest of life isn't.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.172
This guy doesn't
say much, huh?

23:26.205 --> 23:28.608
Never heard him talk,
come to think of it.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.644
Remember when I
dragged your ass

23:31.678 --> 23:33.680
- out of that Humvee?
- Yeah, you remember why?

23:33.713 --> 23:35.181
Sometimes I think
the burns are

23:35.214 --> 23:36.816
payment enough for the
things that we've done.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.117
Other times, I
know they're not.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.587
Holding that key, sitting
in jail for five weeks,

23:40.620 --> 23:42.789
you trusted me
to make a move,

23:42.822 --> 23:45.024
and I knew I could
trust you to wait.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.493
Well, we're in this together,
right?

23:46.526 --> 23:47.226
Damn straight.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.028
The rest of them
can go to hell,

23:49.061 --> 23:53.232
as long as we keep dragging
each other out of the wrecks.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.567
What were you thinking

23:54.601 --> 23:56.736
trying to shoot it out
with the cops?

23:56.769 --> 24:00.507
I was thinking, I'm gonna die
before I go back to jail.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.846
DAVID: You know this is a smoke
screen, right?

24:06.879 --> 24:09.582
Granger sends us off chasing
ghosts while he gets clear.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.984
You know, the best way
to find out is

24:12.018 --> 24:13.820
we'll just ask
Kirkland ourselves.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.588
Do you smell that?

24:15.622 --> 24:17.657
Only one thing
smells like that.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.796
Damn.

24:23.830 --> 24:24.831
(grunts)

24:24.864 --> 24:26.966
Clear.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.200
Mmm.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.975
Special Agent Michael Kirkland.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.546
It's Agent Sinclair.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.047
- Yeah.
- Oh.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.682
Do you have
an Agent Michael Kirkland?

24:42.715 --> 24:43.550
Yeah, he's dead.

24:51.858 --> 24:55.795
Whoever tortured Kirkland
didn't know he had

24:55.828 --> 24:56.929
aortic valve stenosis.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.164
Induced a major heart attack.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.166
And DC is
pushing us off.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.001
Their official
statement is that, uh,

25:02.034 --> 25:04.704
because Kirkland was
in counterintelligence,

25:04.737 --> 25:06.639
his operations may be beyond
our "need to know."

25:06.673 --> 25:07.740
Yeah?

25:07.774 --> 25:09.141
What about unofficially?

25:09.175 --> 25:10.309
I got the impression

25:10.342 --> 25:12.945
no one has any idea what he
was doing in Los Angeles.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.747
Obvious theory is, he was a spy.

25:14.781 --> 25:17.617
Maybe Carter's mystery contact.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.686
He outlives his usefulness
with the Chinese,

25:19.719 --> 25:20.887
and they kill him.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.254
Well, what do you think?

25:23.590 --> 25:25.291
I don't know.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.928
DC's already
asking us

25:28.961 --> 25:30.229
how we found
the body...

25:30.262 --> 25:33.833
Don, we have to come clean.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.002
Look, if Colby's telling
the truth,

25:36.035 --> 25:36.703
we got a leak at the DOJ.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.345
Come on in.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.914
How you doing?

25:49.048 --> 25:51.150
Take a seat.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.021
Any problems?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.055
Nothing we
couldn't handle.

25:56.088 --> 26:00.092
Do you know who I am?

26:00.126 --> 26:02.194
Should I?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.864
Well, that's a question I need
answered, Agent Granger.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.666
Oh, it's not "agent" anymore.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.869
Mike Kirkland says differently.

26:09.902 --> 26:13.172
Am I missing something?

26:13.205 --> 26:17.109
You've been missing
it for two years.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.348
He's a triple agent, Dwayne.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.685
He's been feeding us
lousy intel

26:25.718 --> 26:27.620
and spying on the FBI
for the last two years.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.692
(cocking gun)

26:32.725 --> 26:35.061
May I have the, uh, phone,
please.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.766
How long were you planning
on playing this?

26:39.799 --> 26:42.301
All the way through to China?

26:43.435 --> 26:45.805
If I had to.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.107
So, you were responsible
for transporting

26:48.140 --> 26:49.642
Carter and
Granger?

26:49.676 --> 26:51.043
Yes, sir.

26:51.077 --> 26:51.911
The orders came in late.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.913
I was ranking officer
on the block.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.648
Sir, am I in trouble?

26:55.682 --> 26:57.784
You know an agent
named Mike Kirkland?

26:57.817 --> 26:58.851
No, sir.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.823
All right, let's suppose

27:03.856 --> 27:06.425
your orders were, in fact,
to help these guys escape.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.028
Agent Eppes, are you
accusing me of treason?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.663
That's what helping traitors

27:10.697 --> 27:12.832
escape from custody
would be-- treason.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.101
Agent Kirkland was found dead
this morning, okay.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.069
So, if there was some kind
of classified operation

27:17.103 --> 27:18.971
going on, there's people's
lives in jeopardy.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.973
You understand
what I'm saying?

27:21.007 --> 27:22.942
Yes, sir.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.744
DON:
Kirkland picked the right man.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.212
The guy can definitely
keep a secret.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.981
Or he has no idea
what we're talking about.

27:29.015 --> 27:29.849
All right,
either way

27:29.882 --> 27:31.317
it would only confirm
Colby's story.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.952
It's not going to help us
find him.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.386
All right,

27:34.420 --> 27:36.322
maybe we're just chasing
this thing wrong.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.691
The last time we went
after Carter, what did he do?

27:38.725 --> 27:40.693
Made a run for China.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.061
Then he arranged a murder
from prison,

27:42.094 --> 27:43.896
he pretended to cooperate
with us--

27:43.930 --> 27:44.897
Yeah, but
that was only

27:44.931 --> 27:49.869
to convince the CIA to trade him
back to China.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.704
Right, so how's he plan
to get there?

27:53.039 --> 27:53.940
You're suggesting

27:53.973 --> 27:56.275
we develop a projective
analysis assuming

27:56.308 --> 27:58.010
that Colby and Carter
intend to get to China.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.178
Not Colby-- just Carter.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.246
Everyone agrees

28:00.279 --> 28:02.782
on who he is, you know,
what his motivations are.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.216
Well, that makes
sense, Charlie.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.086
Isn't there a mathematical term
for, uh,

28:07.119 --> 28:10.089
uh, removing the clutter?

28:10.122 --> 28:11.423
Yeah, we call it
"removing the clutter."

28:11.457 --> 28:11.791
Oh.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.793
(chuckles)

28:13.826 --> 28:17.429
I mean, I suppose we could
develop some expressions...

28:19.098 --> 28:20.099
I have to go.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.406
Well, that's how it is,
you know.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.041
He gets an idea.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.043
Yeah.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.913
So, how you doing, David?

28:33.946 --> 28:36.448
Uh, you know, just

28:36.482 --> 28:38.450
trying to treat it
like another case, you know.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.352
I don't see
how you can.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.122
I mean,
it's you and Colby and...

28:43.155 --> 28:46.092
Yeah, that's the thing
about friends...

28:46.125 --> 28:47.226
sometimes they
turn on you.

28:47.259 --> 28:50.229
Yeah, that's the big test,
isn't it?

28:50.262 --> 28:53.099
How do you deal with a really
close friend who lets you down?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.967
Mr. Eppes,

28:55.001 --> 28:57.303
he did not just forget
to pick me up from the airport.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.172
He sold out his country.

29:00.206 --> 29:03.876
I don't want to get all 1960s
on you, but, um,

29:03.910 --> 29:05.311
I've heard that accusation
tossed around a lot

29:05.344 --> 29:06.378
in my lifetime.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.281
And the truth
is, uh...

29:09.315 --> 29:11.250
it's never that simple.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.389
I mean, you might owe it
to yourself and Colby...

29:17.423 --> 29:20.392
to try to understand
why he did what he did

29:20.426 --> 29:23.195
before you actually
close the book on him.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.210
Excuse the camera.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.379
I can't remember things
like I used to.

29:40.412 --> 29:43.382
I should have realized you were
a plant from the start...

29:43.415 --> 29:45.084
we have that in common.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.086
I was born in Beijing--

29:47.119 --> 29:50.222
absorbed into an extensive
training program

29:50.256 --> 29:52.158
just after I
could talk.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.094
They sent me to the
United States

29:55.127 --> 29:58.264
where I was educated
and assimilated.

29:58.297 --> 30:02.401
I was even pre-med
before I...

30:02.434 --> 30:05.337
followed my path
into government service.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.041
Unfortunately,

30:09.075 --> 30:11.043
Kirkland died before
he could answer

30:11.077 --> 30:12.945
the important
questions like,

30:12.979 --> 30:15.081
does the FBI know my name yet?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.918
And, um...

30:18.951 --> 30:20.452
if I go to Washington,
will I be arrested?

30:23.089 --> 30:24.290
Why don't you just ask Dwayne.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.459
He's been working with us
this whole time.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.962
Why don't we start
with something simple--

30:29.996 --> 30:32.198
something I already know--
like your op name.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.935
Arabian Knights.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.004
Stalking Horse.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.941
Lesson number one--

30:41.974 --> 30:46.178
you can't lie,
and I don't bluff.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.932
I may need to find
a new monastery.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.199
(bell tolling)

31:07.233 --> 31:10.402
So, I was on my way to the FBI
to help answer some questions,

31:10.436 --> 31:12.471
and I had to stop
and take a deep breath

31:12.504 --> 31:14.673
before I went
the rest of the way

31:14.706 --> 31:18.077
because I'm not sure
about the optimality

31:18.110 --> 31:20.079
of giving Don the solutions
he's asked for.

31:20.112 --> 31:23.682
Why, because you're not sure
he'll use them wisely?

31:23.715 --> 31:25.184
Well, because I'm not sure
they're right.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.186
I mean, they're right,
but... how can I be sure

31:27.219 --> 31:29.055
that they'll produce
the right outcome?

31:29.088 --> 31:30.356
Yeah, well, you've certainly

31:30.389 --> 31:32.391
wrestled with this
question before.

31:32.424 --> 31:36.195
Yeah, the stakes have seldom
been so personal.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.530
Well, you know, one could posit

31:38.564 --> 31:42.034
that any outcome
the solution produces

31:42.068 --> 31:44.036
is the one that was meant to be.

31:44.070 --> 31:47.306
Science transcends
functions, facts--

31:47.339 --> 31:51.010
it's all a path
to understanding higher truths.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.479
Just yesterday I made
that very same point

31:53.512 --> 31:55.114
to my Intro Game
Theory Class.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.683
Every professor
should spend time

31:57.716 --> 31:59.351
in the back
of his own classroom.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.187
Ah, you're right.
Thank you.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.156
Sorry to interrupt
your meditation.

32:04.190 --> 32:07.726
Silent contemplation has
certainly taught me one thing.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.894
What's that?

32:08.927 --> 32:12.031
You can contemplate silence,
but you can never find it.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.011
What I administered

32:25.044 --> 32:27.546
was a nonlethal dose
of tubocurarine.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.215
It paralyzes the muscles

32:29.248 --> 32:32.084
and depresses the respiratory
capabilities,

32:32.118 --> 32:34.120
creating what I've heard
described

32:34.153 --> 32:37.489
as the sensation
of slowly drowning.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.394
You and I
are in the same position--

32:42.428 --> 32:44.030
both fighting
for freedom,

32:44.063 --> 32:47.233
we're both fighting
for our lives.

32:47.266 --> 32:50.702
Think of what you'd
do in my position,

32:50.736 --> 32:53.039
multiply that by five,

32:53.072 --> 32:57.676
and you'll understand what I'm
willing to put you through.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.184
We assume
that Dwayne Carter intends

33:05.217 --> 33:06.785
to get to China from Los Angeles

33:06.818 --> 33:10.089
by a direct
and safe path.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.457
Now, he is aware

33:11.490 --> 33:13.425
of all the resources
at your disposal--

33:13.459 --> 33:16.295
police dragnets and surveillance
on family and friends.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.763
I mean, you don't need
Karmarkar's algorithm

33:17.796 --> 33:19.198
to see where this is going.

33:19.231 --> 33:23.369
Ernst Straus posited
a roomful of mirrors

33:23.402 --> 33:26.172
and a man lighting a match.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.506
Like lighthouses,

33:27.539 --> 33:29.441
that man wants
to illuminate everything.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.643
Now, as the reflection
of the light bounced

33:31.677 --> 33:33.479
from wall to wall,

33:33.512 --> 33:36.048
Straus wondered
if there was a room so complex

33:36.082 --> 33:38.350
that a match lit
in the right place

33:38.384 --> 33:39.351
couldn't reach every corner.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.386
Well, it was 40 years

33:40.419 --> 33:42.554
before George Tokarsky

33:42.588 --> 33:46.158
devised an answer--
a 26-sided room.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.727
In the spirit of that
problem and solution,

33:48.760 --> 33:51.163
I looked for Carter's
dark corner--

33:51.197 --> 33:53.365
the nearest,
safest Chinese soil.

33:53.399 --> 33:56.168
We already have the Chinese
consulate staked out.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.236
Ah, but he has

33:57.269 --> 33:59.571
a much simpler,
more viable option.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.640
Any ship

34:01.673 --> 34:05.644
flying a Chinese flag
is considered foreign soil

34:05.677 --> 34:07.479
once it's out
of the contiguous zone,

34:07.513 --> 34:08.580
24 nautical miles offshore.

34:08.614 --> 34:09.581
It's practically untouchable.

34:09.615 --> 34:10.416
Right,

34:10.449 --> 34:13.085
so a value-based
algorithm ruled out

34:13.119 --> 34:16.155
private yachts and cruise ships
and any boat incapable

34:16.188 --> 34:18.157
of making
a transpacific journey.

34:18.190 --> 34:21.093
However, it weighted heavily
towards freighters,

34:21.127 --> 34:22.394
and the Port of Los Angeles

34:22.428 --> 34:27.133
recorded 13 Chinese freighters
as of yesterday.

34:30.336 --> 34:33.172
Do they know
my name?

34:33.205 --> 34:35.341
Have they been
watching my contacts?

34:35.374 --> 34:37.176
How much of my network
is compromised?

34:37.209 --> 34:39.478
COLBY: Kirkland never said, and
I never asked.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.314
Is that what Kirkland
said when I asked him?

34:42.348 --> 34:44.216
I know Kirkland.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.318
If you tortured him,
he didn't tell you anything.

34:46.352 --> 34:48.320
That's right.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.624
Quinuclidinyl benzilate...

34:52.658 --> 34:54.293
produces...

34:54.326 --> 34:59.198
akathisia,
an intense desire to move.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.671
It also amplifies
pain receptors...

35:06.805 --> 35:09.141
...so that
even a pinprick

35:09.175 --> 35:10.676
will feel
like you're being stabbed.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.380
It also causes
hallucinations

35:14.413 --> 35:16.448
and a loss of mental
and physical control.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.384
Good.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.486
Then you'll know
what to expect.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.458
DAVID: Four Chinese freighters
pulled out of harbor

35:26.492 --> 35:27.726
this morning.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.262
The Tian Xi was scheduled
to load bicycle parts

35:30.296 --> 35:32.298
and paper pulp headed
for Vietnam next Tuesday.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.933
Instead, it pushed out of harbor
this morning.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.803
NSA's satellite image is
two hours old, but you can see

35:37.836 --> 35:40.639
she's moving past
the 12-mile mark.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.274
What makes the Tian Xi
really interesting is

35:42.308 --> 35:43.709
the bicycle parts
are being loaded

35:43.742 --> 35:44.710
by the China
National Export Company,

35:44.743 --> 35:46.445
which is on our watch list

35:46.478 --> 35:49.581
as a possible front for
Chinese intelligence.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.817
You see that boat right there?

35:53.619 --> 35:54.720
(typing)
Take a look at this.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.325
Actually, you know what?
Do me a favor--

35:59.358 --> 36:00.492
zoom in on that black SUV.

36:00.526 --> 36:03.229
Yeah.
(typing)

36:03.262 --> 36:05.831
I mean, that's
a whip antenna,

36:05.864 --> 36:07.733
isn't it?
One of ours?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.435
(typing)

36:09.468 --> 36:10.802
Let's see.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.304
Infrared markings.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.939
Run it.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.210
All right, so the car
was signed out to this guy.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.411
His name is Mason Lancer.

36:19.445 --> 36:22.748
He's a Special Assistant to
the Deputy Attorney General.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.450
That's exactly the
kind of position

36:24.483 --> 36:26.485
that would have access to
classified information,

36:26.518 --> 36:27.419
but he'd still need
somebody

36:27.453 --> 36:29.321
to go out and steal
what he can't reach.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.656
Yeah, like Carter.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.258
Or Colby Granger.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.362
DAVID:
Now, the ship is 16 miles out.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.830
It's still outside
the 12-mile territorial mark,

36:38.864 --> 36:41.233
but it's inside
the contiguous zone.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.801
Which means we still need
a search warrant

36:42.834 --> 36:44.436
from the State Department
if we want

36:44.470 --> 36:45.371
to board.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.204
How long does that take?

36:46.238 --> 36:48.274
Between three hours
and two days,

36:48.307 --> 36:49.708
no guarantee
that they're going to say yes.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.343
Once they cross
the 24-mile mark,

36:51.377 --> 36:53.011
there's no way
we can get on at all.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.980
All right, look, it
comes down to this:

36:55.013 --> 36:56.915
do we, in fact,
think that Colby is a traitor?

36:56.948 --> 36:57.983
That's all it's about.

36:58.016 --> 37:00.352
Do we? And if we do,
we let the Coast Guard watch

37:00.386 --> 37:01.753
and we wait
for a warrant.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.822
And if he's not,
he could be dead by then.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.924
Yeah.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.362
Um...

37:10.396 --> 37:15.334
so, uh, th-this is
the trust metric I-I prepared

37:15.367 --> 37:16.768
on Colby Granger.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.537
It's, um,

37:18.570 --> 37:21.307
it's a man's life put down
on a few pages of expressions,

37:21.340 --> 37:23.642
distilled down
to an index of trustworthiness,

37:23.675 --> 37:25.377
which is a single number

37:25.411 --> 37:27.313
that incorporates all facets
of his behavior

37:27.346 --> 37:29.381
like, you know,
like the risks he's taken

37:29.415 --> 37:31.049
or the orders he's obeyed

37:31.082 --> 37:32.918
or disobeyed.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.487
The confidences
he's shared.

37:35.521 --> 37:38.390
Yeah, so what
does it tell us?

37:39.525 --> 37:41.727
Nothing.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.396
Nothing we don't already know
in our hearts.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.002
I'm in.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.642
I don't know what to believe,
but I'd like to go find out.

37:56.675 --> 37:59.345
All right, we roll in ten.

38:20.732 --> 38:21.733
(exhales)

38:21.767 --> 38:23.369
Do they know my name?

38:23.402 --> 38:26.672
Your name, your dog's name,
your grandmother's name.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.607
Everybody knows everything.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.811
The last syringe
is potassium chloride,

38:32.844 --> 38:37.483
the finisher in a lethal
injection cocktail.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.584
If I can't know what you know,

38:38.617 --> 38:40.719
then it's really best for me
that no one else does.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.822
What it comes
down to is--

38:43.855 --> 38:47.025
do you want to spend
the last hours in unholy pain

38:47.058 --> 38:49.861
just so that you can die?

38:49.895 --> 38:52.130
Granger, don't do this,
it's not worth it

38:52.163 --> 38:53.565
for some secrets
nobody will care about

38:53.599 --> 38:54.633
six months from now.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.601
Dwayne, I really wish

38:55.634 --> 38:58.370
somebody else had pulled
me out of that fire.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.505
Why?

39:00.639 --> 39:02.708
'Cause I hate owing you.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.514
(siren wailing)

39:08.547 --> 39:10.716
MAN (over speaker):
This is the FBI.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.485
Shut down your engines
and prepare to be boarded.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.727
- What are you doing?
- What I said I would.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.700
(gun cocks, gunshot)

40:01.733 --> 40:02.968
(indistinct yelling)

40:03.001 --> 40:03.969
(gunshot)

40:04.002 --> 40:06.538
(gunfire)

40:06.572 --> 40:07.606
(grunting)

40:12.010 --> 40:14.212
Potassium chloride.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.881
That stuff'll stop
his heart cold.

40:15.914 --> 40:16.448
Plunger wasn't fully deployed,

40:16.482 --> 40:17.849
but he's not breathing.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.718
Colby!
We got to get a medic.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.786
Stay with me!
Wake up!

40:22.754 --> 40:24.122
Let's go!

40:25.757 --> 40:27.158
Wake up!

40:27.192 --> 40:29.828
Colby just keeps owing
this guy, huh?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.897
- Only if he lives.
- Colby, come on.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.031
Let's go! Come on.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.033
Colby!

40:35.066 --> 40:36.868
We've got control, but..
Ah, damn!

40:36.902 --> 40:38.870
Colby, you hear me?!

40:38.904 --> 40:40.906
Wake up! Wake up! Stay with me!
Colby!

40:49.748 --> 40:52.684
Doctors say
his vitals have stabilized,

40:52.718 --> 40:56.588
but it'll be a day or so before
the drugs are out of his system.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.590
Until I saw that needle
sticking out of his chest,

40:58.624 --> 41:00.926
I was sure he was guilty.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.694
You saved his life.

41:02.728 --> 41:06.031
I still don't know who he is.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.233
I didn't know him
when he was a spy.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.936
Now he's some guy
who pretended to be a spy.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.640
Who pretended to be my partner.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.845
You coming in?

41:19.878 --> 41:23.582
No... not yet.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.860
I don't feel
any the lesser

41:34.893 --> 41:36.728
for a night away
from broccoli,

41:36.762 --> 41:38.096
carrots,
and coarse grain bread.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.364
- I'm stuffed.
- ALAN: You know,

41:39.397 --> 41:41.800
celebratory food always tastes
better, Larry, don't you think?

41:41.833 --> 41:44.069
Okay, to, um...

41:44.102 --> 41:46.538
Colby Granger and his
rapid recovery, we hope.

41:46.572 --> 41:48.306
Yeah, well, then,
in that case,

41:48.339 --> 41:49.741
to Don's instincts.

41:49.775 --> 41:51.309
Yeah, and, uh,
your trust metric.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.944
Sounds like a new chapter
in the, uh,

41:52.978 --> 41:55.747
"Mathematical Analysis
of Friendship Dynamics."

41:55.781 --> 41:57.115
I'm not familiar
with that paper.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.150
That was
early Charlie Eppes.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.152
- Ah.
- The mathematics of friendship.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.154
It was like a self-help
manual for eggheads.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.155
Something like that.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.290
No offense.

42:05.323 --> 42:06.658
(chuckles)

42:06.692 --> 42:07.926
You guys might be
on to something.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.227
- Uh, Charlie.
- Charlie.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.295
Charlie, we were just kidding.

42:10.328 --> 42:13.031
Dust off the old paper,
and convert the playground

42:13.064 --> 42:15.734
to an office,
run a few new expressions.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.636
I could publish anyway.

42:17.669 --> 42:18.637
LARRY:
I certainly laud the attempt

42:18.670 --> 42:19.805
to wrestle order
out of the chaos

42:19.838 --> 42:20.806
of interpersonal
relationships,

42:20.839 --> 42:22.608
but how are you going

42:22.641 --> 42:23.642
to address higher
order constraints?

42:23.675 --> 42:24.610
ALAN:
Don't egg him on, Larry.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.612
CHARLIE: Heuristics.
- Heuristics, of course.

42:26.645 --> 42:28.580
- See, no...
- Everybody knows that.

42:28.614 --> 42:29.948
That's why I didn't get
through it to begin with.

42:29.981 --> 42:32.784
I mean, it's too
complicated-- heuristics.
