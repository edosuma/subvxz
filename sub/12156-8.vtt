WEBVTT

00:01.227 --> 00:03.575
You said on the phone that you had
some information about my father.

00:03.683 --> 00:05.435
About both our missing fathers.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.447
Will you marry me?

00:06.562 --> 00:09.606
The kindest thing we can do
is let each other go.

00:09.702 --> 00:12.563
We know you're Harrison Bergeron
but you are also Donald Stark

00:12.649 --> 00:14.867
who once owned
the Hudson sperm bank.

00:14.947 --> 00:17.850
Anything for my future
father-in-law.

00:18.655 --> 00:20.665
I provided all
the spunk myself.

00:20.757 --> 00:24.951
My son, it was so beautiful just
to look at you and your sister.

00:25.684 --> 00:27.781
Did you just say that
rose is my sister?

00:27.853 --> 00:28.794
Yes.

01:25.121 --> 01:27.120
I can't believe
that you're my father.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.988
You rip off insurance companies

01:29.023 --> 01:30.722
and you sold fraudulent sperm.

01:30.756 --> 01:33.856
- You're a con man.
- First of all, that sperm was top notch.

01:33.890 --> 01:37.790
- Secondly, the preferred term is "grifter."
- It doesn't matter.

01:37.824 --> 01:40.257
Either way, you're on the other
side of the law from me.

01:40.291 --> 01:42.725
Listen, shamus, good guys
always need bad guys

01:42.760 --> 01:45.293
just like sons always
need fathers.

01:45.327 --> 01:48.594
- Bullshit.
- You're living in a soft dream, kid.

01:48.628 --> 01:51.762
It's the way the world
works-- Cops and robbers,

01:51.796 --> 01:54.663
cowboys and Indians,
white people and coloreds.

01:54.697 --> 01:59.131
Oh my God, are you even
Jewish or a member of mensa?

01:59.165 --> 02:01.799
I'm black Irish
and a member of AAA.

02:01.833 --> 02:05.867
Look, maybe it was
a mistake to call you,

02:05.902 --> 02:08.268
but you and your sister
came after me, remember?

02:08.301 --> 02:10.735
- I thought this is what you wanted.
- About my sister,

02:10.770 --> 02:14.070
are you sure you were the only one who
provided sperm to the sperm bank?

02:14.105 --> 02:17.538
- You didn't have any friends help out?
- No, it was a solo operation.

02:17.572 --> 02:21.640
It almost killed me.
I have a strong libido, but not that strong.

02:21.674 --> 02:25.042
- I went through cases of vitamin e.
- I have to go.

02:25.076 --> 02:27.143
What--
Uh, wait a minute.

02:27.177 --> 02:28.744
Wait a minute, kid.
Wait.

02:28.779 --> 02:31.979
I'm sorry, I know
I'm a disappointment to you,

02:32.013 --> 02:35.280
but for what it's worth,
you seem like the kind of son

02:35.315 --> 02:37.114
a father could be proud of.

02:37.149 --> 02:39.449
I mean-- You're a little
on the short side,

02:39.484 --> 02:42.817
but other than that,
you have a lot going for you.

02:48.687 --> 02:51.221
Kids, hmph.

03:04.493 --> 03:06.260
Oh, Ray.

03:06.294 --> 03:08.595
What is going on?
It's almost midnight.

03:08.630 --> 03:11.597
- Is Spencer home?
- Yeah, he's 14 months old.

03:11.631 --> 03:14.731
- Of course he's home. Just come-- Okay.
- Spencer!

03:14.765 --> 03:16.732
Come on in.

03:18.768 --> 03:22.635
It's not good for a parent to put
a lot of pressure on their kid,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.536
but you're all
I've got, you know?

03:27.604 --> 03:29.971
You'll never
let me down, right?

03:30.005 --> 03:33.006
No matter what,

03:33.041 --> 03:35.941
you'll still love me, right?

03:44.715 --> 03:47.850
I can't believe
you used to wood glue.

03:47.884 --> 03:49.918
Well, when I get home,
I'm going to yank out

03:49.952 --> 03:52.187
each hair as penance
for your--

03:52.221 --> 03:55.023
For your broken nose. Like a hair-shirt,

03:55.057 --> 03:57.425
but on my face.
As a matter of fact...

03:58.260 --> 04:00.161
- Ow, God!
- Oh oh.

04:00.195 --> 04:02.196
- Oh oh, that hurt.
- Oh, dad,

04:02.230 --> 04:06.033
dad, stop it. I forgive you.

04:06.067 --> 04:09.803
- I love your song.
- Ohh, thank you.

04:09.837 --> 04:13.239
- And Bernard forgives you.
- Yes, I do.

04:13.274 --> 04:16.942
- Huh.
- And I can't wait till Friday.

04:16.978 --> 04:19.795
Good.
What-- What's Friday?

04:19.875 --> 04:23.917
City hall, we're eloping,
just the two of us.

04:23.952 --> 04:27.450
- Oh.
- George, learn from your mistakes.

04:27.485 --> 04:30.584
- No judging.
- <i>No, sorry.</i>

04:30.619 --> 04:32.284
Sorry. It's just--

04:32.319 --> 04:37.122
Well, a father hopes
he can see his daughter off, that's all.

04:37.157 --> 04:39.057
Well, but you weren't
at my first wedding.

04:39.091 --> 04:41.259
Your first wedding?

04:41.293 --> 04:43.961
Don't feel left out, George.
My parents aren't coming.

04:43.996 --> 04:45.629
Of course
they're both dead--

04:45.664 --> 04:47.697
But they would have understood.

04:47.732 --> 04:50.500
Right.
Well,

04:50.534 --> 04:55.305
hey, how about I throw you a
beautiful wedding at George on Jane?

04:55.339 --> 04:58.741
Food and music, no alcohol.

04:58.775 --> 05:02.245
- I would love that.
- Oh, good.

05:02.279 --> 05:04.214
Ooooh.

05:04.248 --> 05:07.583
So...

05:07.618 --> 05:09.114
When were you married before?

05:09.197 --> 05:10.053
It was during my SNM phase.

05:11.888 --> 05:13.922
It wasn't legal.
Just a blood ritual,

05:13.957 --> 05:16.057
so I didn't tell you about it.

05:16.092 --> 05:17.692
Oh good, good, good.

05:17.726 --> 05:19.961
Was there a lot of blood?

05:19.995 --> 05:21.662
Enough.

05:23.398 --> 05:25.165
I can't be
you committed incest.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.867
It's worse than my elder love.

05:26.901 --> 05:28.969
- Did you wear a condom?
- Yes! Yes.

05:29.003 --> 05:31.037
Good, because
you inbreeding is scary

05:31.071 --> 05:32.738
and weird enough
as it is already.

05:32.773 --> 05:35.875
Should I tell rose? She's the first
girl I've liked in a long time

05:35.909 --> 05:39.878
and I know what diseases we're genetically
prone to-- Cancer and colitis.

05:39.912 --> 05:42.513
Look, you have to break up
with her immediately.

05:42.548 --> 05:44.849
And...

05:44.883 --> 05:47.884
I need all your attention now that
Leah doesn't want to marry me.

05:47.919 --> 05:50.687
- I'm so sorry about this, Ray.
- It's okay.

05:50.721 --> 05:54.423
At least I have Spencer.
He'll meet all my emotional needs.

05:55.492 --> 05:57.226
A bond between
a father and son is--

05:57.260 --> 05:59.728
- Is enough for me.
- Hey, don't rub it in.

05:59.762 --> 06:03.231
Because of Bergeron I slept with my sister.
I hate my biological father.

06:03.265 --> 06:05.199
Don't say that.
What if Spencer said that about me?

06:05.233 --> 06:07.067
You gotta give this creep
a second chance.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.835
But he's a crook
and I'm a lawman.

06:08.870 --> 06:11.237
I don't care.
You have to go talk to this guy.

06:11.272 --> 06:14.406
Because if you don't, it could haunt
you for the rest of your life.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.909
Can you come with me
to Coney Island to see him?

06:16.943 --> 06:19.311
I can't. It's the year
anniversary of Super Ray

06:19.345 --> 06:21.445
and I've got a signing
at bergen street comics.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.780
Oh, hold on.

06:23.815 --> 06:25.882
Uh, hi.

06:25.916 --> 06:28.650
What's going on?
What did you learn about the sperm bank?

06:28.684 --> 06:31.486
Uh, nothing.
It was a red herring.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.022
- Another dead end.
- Oh.

06:34.056 --> 06:37.057
- Damn.
- Hey, I'm with a really tormented friend,

06:37.092 --> 06:39.793
who's having a lot of problems,

06:39.827 --> 06:42.462
- can I call you back?
- Oh, okay.

06:42.497 --> 06:45.131
<i>Bye.</i>

06:45.166 --> 06:47.666
- Who was that?
- My beautiful sister.

06:47.701 --> 06:50.569
I knew it.
God!

06:50.603 --> 06:54.707
Look, if you can't break it off
with her, at least wear condoms.

06:54.741 --> 06:57.542
- This is Brooklyn after all.
- Yeah.

06:57.577 --> 07:01.312
Josephine, I am so sorry
I ran out on you last night.

07:01.346 --> 07:04.515
But it is my MO,

07:04.549 --> 07:08.051
even when I'm not stoned
and playing Don Quixote.

07:08.085 --> 07:11.154
It's a lousy MO.
I don't like it.

07:11.188 --> 07:13.323
I tried to tell you this.

07:13.357 --> 07:15.925
My relationships
are like crimes.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.227
I get in, I steal something

07:18.262 --> 07:21.164
- and I leave.
- What do you steal?

07:21.198 --> 07:24.201
Love.
I don't mean to.

07:25.503 --> 07:27.738
It's what I do.

07:29.841 --> 07:32.977
- I think I'm finally hearing you.
- No, no, but wait.

07:33.011 --> 07:36.714
I'm saying this to you
because I want to transform.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.984
Josephine, I'm a 63-year-old
work in progress.

07:41.018 --> 07:44.054
But I am falling for you.

07:45.656 --> 07:47.691
George.

07:51.695 --> 07:55.230
You know, I think we should
take this to the next level.

07:55.264 --> 07:57.999
I think we should
be monogamous.

07:58.033 --> 08:00.668
I thought we were.

08:00.702 --> 08:02.969
Of course we are.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.837
You are such a card.

08:15.914 --> 08:18.615
Well, the prodigal son has returned.
I always wanted to say that. It's classic.

08:18.649 --> 08:21.718
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah, I'm headed for Jacksonville.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.823
They've got a lot of syphilitic
halfwits down there.

08:24.857 --> 08:26.693
It's an easy place to score.

08:26.727 --> 08:29.063
- Why are you going? Is it because of me?
- <i>No, no.</i>

08:29.097 --> 08:31.802
I-- I'm on the lam.

08:31.836 --> 08:34.671
I got in bad
with some groundskeepers.

08:34.706 --> 08:37.741
- Gambling problem.
- So it's serious with this groundskeepers?

08:37.775 --> 08:40.110
Nothing I can't handle
by running away.

08:40.144 --> 08:43.280
But no, I--
I came here to forgive you.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.215
- I want to know my father.
- Damn.

08:45.249 --> 08:47.784
Look, I'm kind of a rush,

08:47.818 --> 08:49.920
but I got time maybe
for one question.

08:49.954 --> 08:52.355
What do you want to know?

08:52.390 --> 08:54.591
Uh...

08:54.625 --> 08:56.660
Do you have any hobbies?

08:56.694 --> 08:58.762
Shit! That's the worst
question possible.

08:58.797 --> 09:01.064
- I don't know.
- No, no, no, it's good.

09:01.099 --> 09:04.801
I saw on your card that you're a writer.
I scribble.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.504
- You probably got that from me.
- Really? You like to write?

09:07.538 --> 09:11.308
Yes, I used to pen a lot of the
letters for "Penthouse" forum.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.410
It was a great side gig
with the insurance fraud,

09:14.445 --> 09:18.348
but then the Internet came and it
destroyed literary pornography.

09:18.382 --> 09:21.451
- God damn it.
- My other dad had those hidden in his closet.

09:21.485 --> 09:24.354
- I must have read your work.
- A lot of people have.

09:24.388 --> 09:27.757
- Wow.
- Listen, I want you to have something

09:27.791 --> 09:30.360
to remember me by.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.195
Uh...

09:32.230 --> 09:33.564
No, no, no, it's a gift.

09:33.598 --> 09:36.534
- I don't want to cross state lines with it.
- Oh.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.606
Thank you, but does this firearm
have the correct paperwork?

09:41.640 --> 09:44.843
Jesus, I thought you were a private
dick, not a Canadian mountie.

09:44.877 --> 09:47.312
You're right.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

09:47.346 --> 09:50.382
- Yeah.
- Business is closed.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.284
Beat it, kid.

09:52.319 --> 09:55.087
- What if I don't want to beat it?
- It's okay, guys.

09:55.122 --> 09:58.423
It's okay. He was just looking
for a Montreal expos cap.

09:58.457 --> 10:01.893
I guess you're
out of luck, mountie.

10:14.303 --> 10:17.038
<i>Why you packing up, old man?
</i> <i>Skipping out on us?</i>

10:17.039 --> 10:20.572
Of course not. I'm just taking some
clothes over to the salvation army.

10:20.606 --> 10:22.373
Bullshit!

10:22.408 --> 10:24.608
Come on, let's go.
Jerry wants to talk to you.

10:24.643 --> 10:26.477
Come on.

11:09.385 --> 11:13.222
<i>I don't like games.</i>

11:13.256 --> 11:16.425
So you were trying
to give me the slip?

11:16.459 --> 11:19.828
I knew you were a liar, but I
didn't think you were stupid.

11:19.862 --> 11:23.899
- I'm a complex person.
- So where's my complex 10 grand?

11:23.933 --> 11:27.169
Listen, I got a good tip
about this new pitcher.

11:27.170 --> 11:31.597
You raise the mound a few inches and
we put our money on a shadow!

11:31.632 --> 11:34.409
Our money?
I want my money!

11:34.443 --> 11:37.713
I'm gonna have
to erase you, Harry.

11:37.747 --> 11:39.281
Pop him here?

11:39.349 --> 11:41.884
Sure, we gotta dig up
centerfield away.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.353
You, drop the gun,
you two, hands up.

11:44.387 --> 11:46.955
And don't test me. I've been going
to the gun range once a week.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.425
- It's that little kid from the hat store.
- Little?

11:55.765 --> 11:58.099
- I should have told you it does that.
- Get him!

11:58.134 --> 12:01.703
- You gave me a broken gun?!
- <i>Well, it works if you don't</i> <i>wing it around.</i>

12:01.738 --> 12:04.607
- Who is this punk?
- He's my son Johnny.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.077
Hey, you can never say your old man
didn't bring you to a ball park.

12:08.111 --> 12:11.339
- Aw shit. Now we gotta bury two bodies.
- What?

12:11.450 --> 12:13.435
Jerry, that's not necessary.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.885
You'll get your money.
Just don't touch the kid.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.888
Suddenly you're flush?

12:17.922 --> 12:20.757
Okay, Phillie,
you go with asshole

12:20.791 --> 12:22.992
and get the cash
and we'll keep the kid.

12:23.026 --> 12:25.061
Where I'm going,
I have to go alone.

12:25.095 --> 12:28.131
It's an old friend in the syndicate
and if I show up with a hard boy,

12:28.165 --> 12:31.001
I won't get in the front door.
So that's the deal.

12:31.068 --> 12:33.203
You keep Johnny.
He's your insurance.

12:33.237 --> 12:37.107
Okay. If you're not
back in 90 minutes,

12:37.141 --> 12:39.443
he's going to be pling
center field-- Permanently.

12:39.477 --> 12:42.279
But I'm a lousy baseball player.
It's not my best sport.

12:42.313 --> 12:45.616
Shut up! I'm ready to
kill this kid right now.

12:45.651 --> 12:47.986
- You going to get my money?
- Yeah, you'll get it.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.690
Don't worry, son.

12:51.724 --> 12:53.492
Dad?

12:56.995 --> 13:01.129
This is the bulk of the work
I produced in the past year.

13:01.164 --> 13:03.963
Sorry there's not more,

13:03.997 --> 13:06.863
but I've had a rough time.

13:07.931 --> 13:10.598
Any questions?
Yes?

13:10.632 --> 13:13.734
What are Exacto Man and the Emasculator
doing to Super Ray in at drawing?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.370
Oh, they're attacking
his spine.

13:17.405 --> 13:22.274
I had back spasms and I
healed them with my own mind.

13:22.308 --> 13:23.975
Yes, in the back.

13:24.010 --> 13:27.812
Can you cure my sore throat
with your mind?

13:27.847 --> 13:30.581
I don't do
other people's bodies.

13:30.616 --> 13:32.616
<i>Next?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

13:32.651 --> 13:35.652
Why aren't there any drawings of
the girl that Super Ray loves?

13:35.687 --> 13:38.655
I worship her.
She's my screen-saver.

13:38.689 --> 13:40.556
She left Super Ray.

13:40.590 --> 13:44.693
And even though his heart is
encased in adamantium fat,

13:44.728 --> 13:46.428
like Wolverine,

13:46.463 --> 13:48.697
he was destroyed.

13:48.731 --> 13:50.865
Is your work autobiographical?

13:50.900 --> 13:52.667
Did a girl leave you?

13:52.701 --> 13:55.036
- Yes and yes.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

13:55.070 --> 13:57.573
But we all love you.

13:57.607 --> 14:00.042
Really?

14:00.076 --> 14:02.612
Thank you.

14:03.681 --> 14:05.582
I guess that's it
for the questions.

14:05.616 --> 14:08.552
I'll just take
some more compliments now.

14:09.387 --> 14:12.489
♪ La la la ♪

14:12.524 --> 14:15.625
♪ la. ♪
You're running out of time

14:15.660 --> 14:18.163
where's the old man?
I hope he loves you.

14:18.197 --> 14:20.366
He does.
He'll be back soon.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.135
Maybe we should give him a call,
let him hear you scream a little.

14:23.170 --> 14:25.671
Or we could call him and I'll use
my normal non-screaming voice.

14:25.705 --> 14:27.472
<i>That was just</i> <i>one thought.</i>

14:27.507 --> 14:29.741
Let's keep brainstorming.
There are no bad ideas.

14:29.776 --> 14:31.710
- Call.
- But just to be clear,

14:31.744 --> 14:34.679
- we're going with your screaming concept?
- Call!

14:41.153 --> 14:43.054
Hi, dad. It's Jonathan.

14:43.088 --> 14:44.589
Um, mm-hmm, no.

14:44.623 --> 14:46.691
Of course I'm still
at Wonders Stadium.

14:46.692 --> 14:48.360
Just seeing how
things coming alone--

14:48.394 --> 14:52.264
Ahh! Ah!

14:52.298 --> 14:54.165
I thought we were going
with normal speaking voice!

14:54.200 --> 14:56.634
If you don't get back here soon,
these guys are definitely

14:56.668 --> 14:58.436
going to kill me, like they say.
So hurry up.

14:58.470 --> 15:00.641
What?
Oh my God.

15:01.649 --> 15:04.999
- I'll be there.
- <i>Okay, I have to go. Bye. I love you.</i>

15:08.545 --> 15:11.346
Sal, I need help.

15:12.782 --> 15:16.184
Yes, that's a good idea, but
let's put it in a to-go cup.

15:16.218 --> 15:18.319
There you go.

15:18.353 --> 15:21.421
- Look, grandma.
- Oh, yeah, it's lovely, yeah.

15:21.456 --> 15:23.757
Uh, excuse me.
Hold on.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.892
This one is...

15:25.926 --> 15:27.560
- For you.
- Oh.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.862
Why don't you call me sometime?

15:29.896 --> 15:31.730
Oh.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.802
Oh. You're really very forward.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.737
Oh, you make it easy.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.774
Oh.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.711
- How are you doing?
- Hi.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.046
Um, were you always a God?

15:48.081 --> 15:51.049
Yes-- Oh God, now what?

15:51.084 --> 15:53.585
George, this better be good.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.921
I'm being told
how great I am by my fans.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.190
Sorry, but Jonathan is
at Brooklyn Wonders Stadium

15:59.225 --> 16:01.626
and he's in trouble. He needs us.
Can you meet me there?

16:01.660 --> 16:04.161
Oh shit, again?
All right, I'll be there.

16:05.830 --> 16:08.965
- Super Ray is needed.
- I always knew your powers were real.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.701
I have to get to Wonders Stadium
to save a disturbed friend.

16:11.736 --> 16:13.670
Do you know the best subway?

16:13.704 --> 16:16.272
Do you need a car?
We could take the Ray Mobile.

16:16.307 --> 16:18.441
There's a Ray Mobile?

16:32.122 --> 16:33.689
Oh, Ray, thank God.

16:33.724 --> 16:36.759
- Who are these people?
- The League of Rays.

16:36.793 --> 16:38.361
Or the Ray-Vengers.

16:38.395 --> 16:40.496
- The name's still under discussion.
- The Rays of Hope.

16:40.530 --> 16:42.630
- Please stop saying that.
- The Ray-Team.

16:42.665 --> 16:46.133
- We'll discuss it at the meeting!
- Hey, guys, I'm stuck.

16:46.167 --> 16:48.168
- Oh come on.
- Well,

16:48.203 --> 16:52.138
good thinking, you know?
We need all the reinforcements we can get.

16:52.173 --> 16:56.677
I brought Sal, but he kinda pooped out.
The car makes him sleepy.

17:00.183 --> 17:02.987
Has your dad always
been such a chiseler?

17:03.021 --> 17:06.326
For as long as I've known him.
Do you have a son?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.194
No, three daughters.

17:08.230 --> 17:11.500
- All of them tarts.
- That's right.

17:15.771 --> 17:17.806
Shut the fuck up!

17:19.642 --> 17:21.777
Whoa!

17:35.322 --> 17:37.589
- He said he was in the stadium.
- He could be anywhere.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.458
You think we're gonna get into trouble
for breaking into this place?

17:40.493 --> 17:43.928
- Do not be negative on a super mission.
- It's okay, man.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.863
That's right.
In a ridiculous situation,

17:45.897 --> 17:47.397
it's important
to think positively.

17:47.432 --> 17:49.767
All right, I have a plan.

17:49.801 --> 17:51.468
Now we need to flush them out.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.737
Are the League of Rays
ready to be heroes?

17:53.771 --> 17:55.272
Hell yeah.

17:55.306 --> 17:57.007
Cocked and loaded.

17:57.041 --> 17:58.642
Okay.

18:00.478 --> 18:03.012
Five more minutes, kid.

18:05.048 --> 18:08.291
- Then we shoot you in the head.
- Do you have to be so explicit?

18:11.221 --> 18:14.290
<i>Let Jonathan Ames go.</i>

18:14.325 --> 18:16.726
Who the fuck is that?

18:19.063 --> 18:20.797
Come on.

18:29.707 --> 18:31.307
I don't like this.

18:35.546 --> 18:38.482
- What the hell?
- Who the fuck are these guys?

18:38.516 --> 18:40.017
They're Super Rays.

18:40.051 --> 18:43.154
<i>Villains,</i> <i>release Jonathan Ames</i>

18:43.188 --> 18:44.789
<i>or you will</i> <i>feel the wrath</i>

18:44.824 --> 18:48.026
<i>of Super Ray</i> <i>and his minions.</i>

18:48.061 --> 18:51.163
- Who's in the booth?
- M-maybe minions isn't the right word.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.064
Uh, followers or sycophants?

18:53.099 --> 18:54.967
<i>Uh, super-- Super fans!</i>

18:55.001 --> 18:57.703
Maybe "minions" was
the best, actually.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.705
Screw this.
Charge!

19:13.478 --> 19:15.692
They have guns!
They have guns!

19:18.551 --> 19:21.353
- Run, Rays, run!
- Ray down!

19:21.387 --> 19:23.322
Okay, come on, come on!

19:27.827 --> 19:30.195
Help me!

19:42.106 --> 19:43.706
Good one!
Good one, yes!

19:43.740 --> 19:45.641
I'm coming, Ray!

19:48.578 --> 19:50.379
Oh no.
Oh my God.

19:51.748 --> 19:53.248
- Take over!
- Get down.

19:54.417 --> 19:56.918
Serpentine, Jonathan,
serpentine!

20:00.523 --> 20:02.391
Stop shooting--
You'll hurt him.

20:02.425 --> 20:03.525
<i>Stop shooting.</i>

20:03.559 --> 20:05.127
Get the little bastard.

20:06.229 --> 20:08.297
Slide like Jackie Robinson.

20:13.036 --> 20:15.070
- Fuck.
- Yes!

20:15.105 --> 20:17.739
Oh God!
Oh God, oh!

20:17.773 --> 20:19.207
Oh.

20:19.242 --> 20:20.875
<i>Non, no, no, no, no!</i>

20:20.910 --> 20:24.646
Make a move
and it'll be your last.

20:25.714 --> 20:28.182
We did it.
We did it!

20:31.887 --> 20:33.487
- Bye!
- Bye!

20:33.522 --> 20:35.356
See you guys next week
at the meeting.

20:35.390 --> 20:37.124
I love your new friends.

20:37.159 --> 20:40.194
- Yeah, they're good people.
- Thank you guys for saving my life--

20:40.228 --> 20:43.030
- Again.
- Of course, Jonathan.

20:44.399 --> 20:47.468
I'm just sorry
your father abandoned you.

20:47.502 --> 20:50.671
It's all right.
I knew you guys would come for me.

20:53.642 --> 20:55.209
Shit, is Sal dead?

20:55.243 --> 20:58.079
He shouldn't be.
I left a window open.

20:58.113 --> 21:00.982
Sal, wake up.
Come on, wake up.

21:31.580 --> 21:35.850
Daddy, I thought you said there
wasn't going to be any alcohol.

21:35.885 --> 21:38.519
Oh no, I meant
no alcohol for you.

21:38.553 --> 21:40.921
- Oh God--
- Oh no, sweetheart,

21:40.955 --> 21:45.291
I can't give a father's wedding
toast without champagne.

21:45.325 --> 21:47.693
And look, look,
I've got marinellis

21:47.727 --> 21:50.195
for you and, um, uh, Bernard.

21:50.230 --> 21:53.398
- Right, and wasn't that thoughtful?
- Okay, fine.

21:54.266 --> 21:55.900
- Go sit, go on.
- Okay.

21:58.603 --> 22:01.204
Uh, excuse me, everybody.

22:01.239 --> 22:02.939
I'd like to say a few words.

22:04.875 --> 22:08.277
What I have learned
in my 63 years

22:08.312 --> 22:11.513
is that we all walk this

22:11.548 --> 22:15.483
rarzor's ed of feeling
like our lives are

22:15.518 --> 22:17.752
both meaningful

22:17.786 --> 22:20.054
and meaningless.

22:21.022 --> 22:23.957
This can lead to depression,

22:23.991 --> 22:26.626
confusion

22:26.660 --> 22:29.828
and melancholy.

22:29.863 --> 22:33.198
Oh no. He's making this about himself.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.297
And all the goers tell
us that we,

22:35.600 --> 22:37.701
we should live in the now,

22:37.735 --> 22:41.836
but I always feel like I'm one
second behind my own life,

22:41.871 --> 22:44.672
never fully present-- Hmm?

22:47.007 --> 22:49.908
So I say to you, Emily...

22:51.478 --> 22:53.346
Let yourself be loved,

22:53.380 --> 22:55.781
which is one of the hardest
things to learn in life.

22:55.815 --> 23:00.584
But you are so worthy
of being cherished,

23:00.619 --> 23:04.188
and I love you
with all my being.

23:04.189 --> 23:06.559
To Emily and Bernard!
