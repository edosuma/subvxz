WEBVTT

03:11.065 --> 03:12.233
You're sure?

03:16.571 --> 03:18.907
With his own eyes, Your Grace.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.378
Stay here. Tell no one.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.049
Help me dress.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.440
Who knows?

03:55.985 --> 03:57.570
My handmaiden, Talya.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.073
Some of the servants.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.497
I saw him last night...

04:08.414 --> 04:09.958
before he--

04:14.671 --> 04:16.798
He told me he wished for Aegon to be king.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.392
It is the truth.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.228
Uttered with his own lips.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.856
His last words to me
and I was the only one to hear it.

04:35.274 --> 04:36.609
And now he's dead.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.934
What is it that could not
have waited an hour?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.561
Was Dorne invaded?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.816
The King is dead.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.412
We grieve for Viserys the Peaceful...

05:30.788 --> 05:32.331
our sovereign...

05:34.459 --> 05:35.626
our friend.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.175
But he has left us a gift.

05:45.011 --> 05:49.057
With his last breath, he impressed
upon the Queen his final wish:

05:49.140 --> 05:51.476
that his son, Aegon...

05:52.685 --> 05:56.689
should succeed him
as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.201
Then we may proceed now
with the full assurance

06:08.284 --> 06:10.953
of his blessing on our long-laid plans.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.081
Yes.
There is much to be done,

06:13.164 --> 06:14.624
as we've previously discussed.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.751
Now, there are two among the captains

06:16.834 --> 06:19.504
of the City Watch that
remain loyal to Daemon.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.131
Let us replace them.
Lord Lannister.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.674
The Treasury is well in hand.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.718
The gold will be divided for safekeeping.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.930
Let ravens be sent to our allies,
Riverrun and Highgarden.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.807
Am I to understand that
members of the small council

06:30.890 --> 06:34.435
have been planning secretly
to install my son without me?

06:34.519 --> 06:39.065
My Queen, there was no need
to sully you with darkling schemes.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.900
I will not have this.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.027
To hear that you are plotting

06:43.111 --> 06:46.447
to replace the King's chosen heir
with an imposter!

06:46.531 --> 06:48.825
His firstborn son is hardly an imposter.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.286
Hundreds of lords and landed knights
swore fealty to the Princess.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.330
That was some 20 years ago.
Most of them now dead.

06:54.413 --> 06:55.665
You heard the Lord Hand.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.959
Plot or no, the King changed his mind.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.629
I am six-and-seventy years old.

07:01.712 --> 07:06.050
I have known Viserys longer
than any who sit at this table.

07:06.134 --> 07:10.596
And I will not believe that he said this
on his deathbed, alone,

07:10.680 --> 07:13.808
with only the boy's mother as a witness.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.811
This is seizure!

07:16.894 --> 07:19.480
It is theft! It is treason!

07:19.564 --> 07:22.984
-At the least, it is--
-Mind your tongue, Lyman.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.945
The King was well last night...

07:26.028 --> 07:27.572
by all accounts.

07:29.615 --> 07:33.953
Which of you here can swear
that he died of his own accord?

07:34.036 --> 07:37.707
Which of us are you accusing of regicide,
Lord Beesbury?

07:37.790 --> 07:41.961
Whether it was one of you,
or all of you, I care not.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.796
-I will have no part--
-Sit down!

07:44.797 --> 07:46.132
Ser Criston.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.439
Throw down your sword
and remove your cloak, Ser Criston.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.402
I am your Lord Commander, Ser Criston.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.446
Cast down your sword.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.199
I will not suffer insults
to Her Grace the Queen.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.410
There was no insult to me, Ser Criston.
Put aside your blade.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.504
-Has it come to this?
-Lord Commander, enough.

08:29.091 --> 08:32.428
-Let us have Lord Beesbury removed.
-No.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.974
The door remains shut
until we finish our business.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.785
Storm's End is of concern.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.038
We may not assume
the loyalty of Lord Borros.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.832
But he has four daughters,
all of them unmarried.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.044
-The right proposal--
-What of Rhaenyra?

09:05.127 --> 09:08.839
The former heir cannot,
of course, be allowed to remain free

09:08.923 --> 09:11.842
and draw support to her claim.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.346
-You mean to imprison her.
-She and her family

09:15.429 --> 09:16.681
will be given the opportunity

09:16.764 --> 09:20.977
to publicly swear obeisance
to the new King.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.979
She will never bend the knee.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.897
Nor will Daemon, which you know.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.904
You plan to kill them.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.744
And all here accede to this.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.038
Your father is correct, Your Grace.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.709
A living challenger
invites battle and bloodshed.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.253
It is unsavory, yes.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.215
But a sacrifice we must make
to secure Aegon's succession.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.301
And then there is Daemon to consider.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.845
-The King wouldn't wish for any unsavory--
-But the King did not wish

09:55.928 --> 09:57.680
for the murder of his daughter!

09:58.889 --> 10:00.891
He loved her.
I will not have you deny this.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.852
-And yet--
-One more word and I will have you removed

10:02.935 --> 10:04.854
from this chamber and sent to the Wall!

10:15.615 --> 10:18.242
What do you suggest, Your Grace?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.497
Time is of the essence.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.593
Lord Commander Westerling...

10:37.261 --> 10:38.888
take your knights to Dragonstone.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.890
Be quick and be clean.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.531
I am Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.704
I recognize no authority but the King's.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.665
And until there is one...

11:08.959 --> 11:10.878
I have no place here.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.977
It is our fate, I think,
to crave always what is given to another.

11:27.686 --> 11:31.607
If one possesses a thing,
the other will take it away.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.192
Yes, Princess.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.406
Where is Aegon?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.576
Not here.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.578
He's not in his rooms.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.837
Father.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.848
What's happened?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.740
-Your father--
-There is a beast beneath the boards.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.243
Oh, my dearest love.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.099
Ser Erryk.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.396
Where's the Prince?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.274
Forgive me, Lord Hand. I do not know.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.860
But you're sworn to protect him.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.653
He exploits his authority
to order me away,

12:59.737 --> 13:01.655
and then he evades me, my Lord.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.871
I believe he may have
left the Keep secretly,

13:08.954 --> 13:10.456
gone into the city.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.041
Find him.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.006
Take no one else but your brother.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.383
And remove your white cloaks.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.636
None can know who you are
or what you seek...

13:24.386 --> 13:26.597
including the Queen.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.598
My Lord.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.144
Bring him to me, and me alone, Ser Erryk.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.540
What is the meaning of this?

14:13.310 --> 14:14.812
Guard. Guard!

14:29.493 --> 14:32.413
Prince Aegon's not to be found
within the castle walls, Your Grace.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.498
Your father has sent
Ser Erryk into the city to find him.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.170
Ser Erryk knows Aegon.
He has the advantage.

14:47.261 --> 14:51.974
I trust again to you, Ser Criston,
and to your loyalty.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.602
Aegon must be found,
and he must be brought to me.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.771
The very fate of the Seven Kingdoms
depends on it.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.860
Everything you feel for me
as your Queen.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.780
I will not fail you.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.575
I'll come with you.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.202
That would not be my desire, Aemond.

15:12.953 --> 15:17.041
-If anything has happened--
-Cole needs me, Mother.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.252
Ser Erryk isn't the only one
who knows Aegon's doings.

15:46.570 --> 15:50.157
Aegon brought me to the Street of Silk
on my thirteenth name day.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.160
It was his duty as my brother, he said,

15:53.243 --> 15:56.372
to ensure I was as educated as he was.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.671
At least that's what
I understood him to mean.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.508
I don't follow.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.718
He said, “Time to get it wet.”

16:10.761 --> 16:14.556
Every woman is an image of the Mother,
to be spoken of with reverence.

16:23.315 --> 16:28.112
Sometime last night, we...
misplaced our drinking companion.

16:28.195 --> 16:31.615
Knowing that he has been, in the past,
a patron of your fine establishment,

16:31.699 --> 16:33.867
we thought to inquire here
as to his whereabouts.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.786
And describe him.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.664
That is a delicate matter.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.794
You see, the man we seek
is the young Prince Aegon.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.422
I may trust, I hope,
in the discretion of your trade.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.758
The Prince is not here.

16:50.801 --> 16:54.138
Has he been here? Earlier, perhaps?

16:54.763 --> 16:58.684
-Quite a bit earlier. Years ago, in fact.
-But more recently?

17:00.519 --> 17:03.063
He does not frequent the Street of Silk.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.066
His tastes are known to be...

17:07.401 --> 17:09.319
less discriminating.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.196
Meaning what?

17:12.740 --> 17:17.661
I wish you luck, good Ser.
And my best to your friend.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.961
How you've grown.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.804
Viserys amended his wishes.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.681
It's as simple as that.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.977
You once swore your banners to Rhaenyra.

17:42.060 --> 17:46.732
You must now
pledge them to the future king.

17:53.655 --> 17:57.785
I must confer first
with my house on this matter.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.915
You'll not leave this room
without declaring your intention.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.718
I am no oath breaker.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.348
I will not bend the knee.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.066
Anyone else?

18:40.994 --> 18:45.916
House Fell keeps its sworn oath
to the Princess.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.504
Very well.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.859
Long live the King.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.777
Long live the King.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.645
It seems you were mistaken
as to Aegon's habits.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.356
He could be in the hands of mercenaries,

19:51.440 --> 19:52.816
on a ship to Yi Ti.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.652
He could be dead.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.363
Let us hope, for your mother's sake,
that is not the case.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.756
Let's have a look.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.467
-Go on.
-Come here. Come here!

20:18.550 --> 20:19.801
Get in there, you little--

20:27.643 --> 20:28.685
Yeah!

20:30.020 --> 20:30.812
Come on!

20:39.363 --> 20:40.864
How old are they?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.743
About 10 years, I should say.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.537
They have them grow their nails
and file the teeth.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.414
Makes them more formidable.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.750
Come on!

20:51.833 --> 20:54.586
Prince Aegon spends many
a night in this place.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.213
Do you see now what he is?

20:57.130 --> 20:58.382
You've not seen everything.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.810
-Aegon's?
-One of many, I'd wager.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.580
Here I am, trawling the city,
ever the good soldier

21:30.664 --> 21:34.126
in search of a wastrel who's never taken
half an interest in his birthright.

21:36.086 --> 21:39.047
'Tis I the younger brother
who studies history and philosophy,

21:39.131 --> 21:40.632
it is I who trains with the sword,

21:40.716 --> 21:42.592
who rides the largest dragon in the world.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.219
It is I who should be--

21:48.515 --> 21:51.393
I know what it is to toil
for what others are freely given.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.982
And we can't find him, Cole.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.569
You are a decent man
with no taste for depravity.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.612
His secrets are his own...

22:02.696 --> 22:04.114
and he's welcome to them.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.116
I'm next in line to the throne.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.369
Should they come looking for me,

22:09.453 --> 22:11.246
I intend to be found.

22:21.089 --> 22:24.051
Something must be done.
Aegon is unfit to rule.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.178
You tolerated
the Prince's proclivities for years.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.971
Because it was my sworn duty, Arryk.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.931
It's for the Hand to find wisdom.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.225
We swore an oath of service until death.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.227
A moment of your time, m'lords.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.106
You'll find no buyers for your wares here.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.236
I can take you to Prince Aegon.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.200
Rather, I am sent by one
who knows where he is.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.202
Who'll tell you, for a price.

22:51.828 --> 22:54.831
Deliver him,
and we'll consider your price.

22:55.457 --> 22:59.419
My mistress will not
treat with the servants of the Keep...

22:59.503 --> 23:01.421
exalted though they may be.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.758
She'll trust this to
the Hand of the King only.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.259
Impossible.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.806
I think he will wish to hear
what the White Worm can tell him.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.782
Halt! Hold the gate!

23:31.827 --> 23:33.036
Let go of me!

23:33.120 --> 23:34.788
He was fleeing from the gate.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.039
Do you know who I am?

23:36.123 --> 23:38.583
A warning for the Princess, I'd wager.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.628
What say you?

23:42.921 --> 23:45.841
The Lord Confessor presumes.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.594
I have no love for the Princess.

23:49.970 --> 23:53.098
And where were you going then
with such urgency?

23:59.146 --> 24:01.064
Let the King's Justice take him.

24:05.485 --> 24:07.279
Let go of me!

24:07.362 --> 24:10.240
-No! This is not right!
-You did well, Lord Larys.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.118
-I will--
-Only my duty, my Lord Hand.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.494
Who do you think you are?

24:14.578 --> 24:16.705
You've spent many hours
with the Queen of late.

24:23.587 --> 24:27.966
There's no reason those hours could not,
in the end, benefit you.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.850
I will do you the considerable
courtesy of assuming

26:00.934 --> 26:04.854
there is a good reason for the outrage
of my treatment here this morning.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.317
My sincerest regrets
for the lack of ceremony.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.113
The King.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.037
And you are usurping the throne.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.998
It was my husband's dying wish.

26:23.081 --> 26:26.793
Believe it or no,
it is of no consequence.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.169
Aegon will be king.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.466
I came here to ask your support.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.262
Well, I must credit you for your boldness.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.140
House Velaryon has long allied itself

26:40.223 --> 26:43.393
with the Princess Rhaenyra
and what has it gained you?

26:44.686 --> 26:47.814
Your daughter dead... alone in Pentos.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.734
Your son cuckolded.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.986
Rhaenyra's heirs are none of yours.

26:54.612 --> 26:58.742
It is your husband
who grasps so heedlessly for the throne.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.161
And even he has abandoned you:

27:01.244 --> 27:03.913
gone these six long years
to fight a desperate battle,

27:03.997 --> 27:07.083
returning grievously,
if not mortally, wounded,

27:07.167 --> 27:09.794
leaving the Lady of Driftmark
to chart her course alone.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.550
The word of my house is not fickle.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.722
No. But, dear cousin...

27:22.474 --> 27:26.686
you more than any soul alive
understand what I say now.

27:26.770 --> 27:31.191
Princess Rhaenys, I loved my husband,
but I will speak the truth we both know.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.777
You should've been queen.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.448
I little thought to hear
those words from you.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.368
The Iron Throne was yours
by blood and by temperament.

27:41.451 --> 27:44.079
Viserys would've lived
his days a country lord,

27:44.162 --> 27:46.206
content to hunt and study his histories,

27:46.289 --> 27:48.416
but... here we are.

27:50.835 --> 27:54.672
We do not rule
but we may guide the men that do.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.132
Gently...

27:56.966 --> 28:00.595
away from violence and sure destruction
and instead toward peace.

28:02.222 --> 28:05.308
Is it in the name of peace
that you've imprisoned me?

28:05.392 --> 28:07.560
-And what of my dragon?
-If we are overmatched,

28:07.644 --> 28:10.021
Rhaenyra will be tempted to strike us,
and war will ensue.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.151
Without your dragon,
she may be persuaded to negotiate.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.573
If it's Driftmark you want,
you shall have it

28:20.657 --> 28:24.119
for you and your granddaughters
to pass on as you see fit.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.501
You are wiser than I believed you to be...

28:34.879 --> 28:36.798
Alicent Hightower.

28:37.298 --> 28:40.844
A true queen counts
the cost to her people.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.265
And yet you toil still in service to men.

28:45.765 --> 28:48.685
Your father, your husband, your son.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.105
You desire not to be free,

28:52.188 --> 28:55.233
but to make a window
in the wall of your prison.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.779
Have you never imagined yourself...

28:59.863 --> 29:01.573
on the Iron Throne?

29:14.127 --> 29:16.045
I'll leave you with your thoughts.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.800
Ring the bell when you have an answer.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.451
My Prince.

29:56.711 --> 30:00.632
You yourself are the mysterious
White Worm, I take it.

30:02.217 --> 30:06.012
Or are you simply a further peel
in this stinking onion?

30:08.014 --> 30:10.934
My condolences
on the passing of your king.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.951
Where is Prince Aegon?

30:28.034 --> 30:34.082
I thought, the Prince is in Flea Bottom
where no one is to be trusted.

30:34.165 --> 30:39.379
I'd best secrete him somewhere safe...
in case they come looking for him.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.548
Where's the Prince?

30:41.631 --> 30:44.175
He is safely tucked away.

30:46.511 --> 30:51.224
I want an end to the savage use
of children in Flea Bottom.

30:51.307 --> 30:54.102
They are forced to fight, and worse...

30:54.686 --> 30:58.606
your gold cloaks take
the bribes given them to look away.

30:59.524 --> 31:05.905
An obscenity
either tolerated or ignored by the crown.

31:07.657 --> 31:09.200
I'll look into it.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.244
You have my word.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.293
When your plots ripen

31:18.376 --> 31:22.547
and you install your grandson
on the throne,

31:22.630 --> 31:25.800
remember it was me who put him there.

31:25.883 --> 31:30.054
I could have killed him
as easily as a wasp on fruit.

31:30.138 --> 31:35.059
There is no power but what
the people allow you to take.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.647
I will remember.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.423
Listen.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.600
No... No!

32:16.559 --> 32:17.518
No!

32:26.152 --> 32:28.321
Where is the White Worm?

32:28.404 --> 32:29.739
She sold you for a price.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.741
And why have you paid it?

32:33.117 --> 32:35.036
I want my mother.

32:35.870 --> 32:39.457
Your grandfather, the Hand,
will meet you outside the city walls.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.967
You flee what other men
die seeking, Aegon.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.778
I do regret this, friend.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.477
No! Stop! No.

33:46.023 --> 33:48.985
-I was hoping you disappeared.
-Is our father truly dead?

33:49.068 --> 33:52.113
Yes... and they're going to make you king.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.242
-No!
-Are you going to help me?!

33:58.995 --> 34:01.372
No! Let me go!

34:01.456 --> 34:02.498
Where's your brother, huh?

34:04.584 --> 34:05.710
Let me go!

34:06.252 --> 34:07.378
Brother!

34:14.719 --> 34:16.262
Let me go!

34:17.430 --> 34:18.973
I have no wish to rule!

34:19.056 --> 34:21.726
No taste for duty! I'm not suited.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.352
You'll get no argument from me.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.981
You let me go,
I will find a ship and sail away,

34:27.065 --> 34:28.191
never to be found.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.696
The Queen awaits.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.814
-Well played.
-None of this is a game.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.024
And yet you treat it as one.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.735
A charming contest,

35:12.819 --> 35:16.781
the prize, a pouch of silver.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.704
We have relied on one another
these many years.

35:23.788 --> 35:27.708
And now it is the good of the family
that we both desire.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.796
Whatever our differences,
our hearts remain as one.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.800
Our hearts were never one.

35:35.883 --> 35:37.552
I see that now.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.263
Rather, I have been a piece
that you moved about the board.

35:40.346 --> 35:44.684
If that is true, then I made you
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

35:45.852 --> 35:49.397
-Would you have desired it otherwise?
-How could I know?

35:50.231 --> 35:53.150
I wanted whatever you
impressed upon me to want.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.112
And now the debt comes due.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.241
-A debt you were happy enough to pay.
-A sacrifice.

36:01.117 --> 36:04.912
A sacrifice made for
the stability of the realm.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.206
No king has ever lived
that hasn't had to forfeit

36:07.290 --> 36:09.375
the lives of a few to protect the many.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.586
Though I understand your squeamishness.

36:11.669 --> 36:15.256
Reluctance to murder is not a weakness!

36:19.010 --> 36:20.678
I have Aegon.

36:20.761 --> 36:22.471
We'll proceed now as I see fit.

36:29.353 --> 36:32.481
We will send terms
to Rhaenyra on Dragonstone.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.568
True terms, such that she
may accept without shame.

36:35.651 --> 36:39.447
If she lives, her allies
will mass behind her banners,

36:39.530 --> 36:42.158
-looking for her return.
-Then she must not return.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.077
My husband would have
desired this mercy be shown

36:45.161 --> 36:46.913
-to his daughter.
-Your husband?

36:47.914 --> 36:50.666
Or you, his daughter's
childhood companion?

36:55.254 --> 36:58.382
Criston Cole will be named
Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

36:59.842 --> 37:01.969
My son will be anointed tomorrow at dawn.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.181
The whole of King's Landing
must witness his ascent.

37:06.098 --> 37:09.101
He will assume authority.
There will be no more dithering.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.313
My son will take
the crown of his namesake, the Conqueror,

37:12.396 --> 37:14.565
and carry Blackfyre, his sword.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.902
Let the people remember
the ancient strength of House Targaryen.

37:22.031 --> 37:25.159
You look so much like your mother
in certain lights.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.505
As you wish.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.352
Your Grace.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.400
The hour is late, Lord Larys.

37:58.484 --> 38:02.154
I've found out something
that you should know.

38:13.958 --> 38:17.211
Have you asked yourself, I wonder...

38:17.294 --> 38:19.547
how it is...

38:19.630 --> 38:22.174
that your father, the Hand...

38:23.592 --> 38:25.720
found Aegon first?

38:58.669 --> 39:02.423
There is a web of spies
at work in the Red Keep.

39:02.506 --> 39:06.719
Along its threads
travels news of all our doings.

39:07.470 --> 39:11.557
Your father knows this,
but has left it in place.

39:12.975 --> 39:17.229
More than once, it has proved advantageous
to those willing to...

39:18.064 --> 39:20.357
feed the weaver.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.652
And this weaver watches me?

39:48.427 --> 39:52.973
One of the little spiders
is your lady-in-waiting.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.770
-Talya?
-There are more like her.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.980
Even I do not know their number.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.988
There is one way to destroy his advantage.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.909
It must be taken out at the head.

40:13.702 --> 40:18.624
When the Queen dies,
the bees fly without purpose.

40:20.292 --> 40:23.212
Begging your pardon
for the turn of phrase, Your Grace.

40:25.214 --> 40:28.008
I assume this task
falls within your expertise.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.219
If you wish it...

40:32.138 --> 40:33.597
it will be done.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.094
Out of my way!

42:02.478 --> 42:04.063
With me, Princess.

42:04.146 --> 42:05.856
I cannot let this treachery stand.

42:46.313 --> 42:49.400
-Where are we?
-Just south of King's Way.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.403
The Blackwater's this way.

43:20.597 --> 43:22.516
I won't leave Meleys.

43:23.225 --> 43:25.269
-If I could get to the Dragonpit, then--
-No.

43:25.352 --> 43:27.062
They'll expect you there, Princess.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.064
You won't get past the gates.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.275
Now come.

43:31.358 --> 43:33.527
You must make for the riverfront
and find a ship.

43:33.610 --> 43:35.279
Before they know you've gone.

43:35.362 --> 43:37.531
Move it! Go! Go!

43:37.614 --> 43:39.158
This way!

43:39.241 --> 43:41.702
Keep moving! That's right.

43:41.785 --> 43:43.120
That's right!

43:44.955 --> 43:47.124
-Onward!
-This way.

43:47.207 --> 43:49.126
Halt! Halt!

43:51.670 --> 43:53.547
Keep moving!

43:58.510 --> 44:01.055
All of you, move forward!

44:05.768 --> 44:06.810
Keep moving!

44:18.197 --> 44:19.490
Out of the way!

44:20.783 --> 44:22.117
Out of the way!

44:43.347 --> 44:45.432
Have the decency to look grateful.

44:46.683 --> 44:49.228
Do you know what has been
done to give you this day?

44:52.606 --> 44:54.400
In an hour, you will be king.

44:54.483 --> 44:57.277
-And my father never wanted this.
-That's not true.

44:57.361 --> 45:00.447
He had 20 years to name me heir
and never did.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.866
Steadfastly, he upheld Rhaenyra's claim.

45:03.450 --> 45:04.535
He changed his mind.

45:07.621 --> 45:08.539
No...

45:09.206 --> 45:12.376
He could have, but he never did

45:12.459 --> 45:13.794
because he didn't like me.

45:15.170 --> 45:17.464
And yet, with his final breath,

45:17.548 --> 45:20.592
he whispered to me that you
should take his place on the throne.

45:41.071 --> 45:44.241
-Do not toy with me, Mother.
-I speak the truth.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.424
Listen to me, Aegon.

46:01.341 --> 46:03.510
Your grandfather, the Hand,
will try to impress on you

46:03.594 --> 46:05.471
that Rhaenyra should be put to the sword.

46:05.554 --> 46:07.723
You must reject this counsel.

46:08.765 --> 46:10.642
We must not rule
with cruelty and callousness.

46:10.726 --> 46:13.687
For all her faults, she is your sister,
your father's daughter--

46:13.770 --> 46:15.063
Do you love me?

46:18.650 --> 46:20.360
You imbecile.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.988
Make way for the royal wheelhouse!

46:39.171 --> 46:41.089
Hey, hey, forward then.

46:42.841 --> 46:45.177
Go on, move yourself! Come on!

47:46.905 --> 47:49.491
People of King's Landing...

47:49.575 --> 47:52.202
today is the saddest of days.

47:53.328 --> 47:55.372
Our beloved king...

47:56.081 --> 47:58.792
Viserys the Peaceful...

48:00.085 --> 48:01.420
is dead.

48:07.759 --> 48:11.305
But it is also the most joyous of days...

48:12.556 --> 48:15.100
for as his spirit left us...

48:17.185 --> 48:19.479
he whispered his final wish:

48:19.563 --> 48:23.900
that his firstborn son, Aegon...

48:25.110 --> 48:27.446
should succeed him.

48:38.248 --> 48:39.583
Guards!

48:41.043 --> 48:43.378
Out of the way! Move!

48:51.887 --> 48:53.263
Halt!

48:53.347 --> 48:54.473
Turn!

49:03.774 --> 49:05.734
Present...

49:05.817 --> 49:06.943
arms!

49:40.477 --> 49:42.646
It is your great good fortune

49:42.729 --> 49:46.858
and privilege...
to be here to witness this:

49:48.026 --> 49:50.445
a new day for our city...

49:51.571 --> 49:54.366
a new day for our realm.

49:54.449 --> 49:58.662
A new king... to lead us.

50:57.137 --> 51:00.056
May the Warrior give him courage.

51:02.851 --> 51:07.397
May the Smith
lend strength to his sword and shield.

51:09.608 --> 51:12.527
May the Father defend him in his need.

51:15.906 --> 51:22.412
May the Crone lift her shining lamp
and light his way to wisdom.

51:47.437 --> 51:50.982
The crown of the Conqueror,
passed down through generations.
