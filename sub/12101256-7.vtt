00:08.141 --> 00:09.510
Jack: Where in the hell are we?

00:09.543 --> 00:10.377
Florian: Transylvania.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.813
Violet: Jack travelled back in
time?

00:12.846 --> 00:15.115
Ivory: To 1778?

00:15.148 --> 00:17.985
These numbers?
They look like coordinates.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.820
Violet: She must want us
to go somewhere.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.922
Doc: I'm experimenting
with a new serum.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.958
Any more than this,
your heart could explode.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.994
I made as many bullets
as I could.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.263
Please, use these sparingly.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.431
Axel: 'Cause this thing is
magic, don't make it foolproof.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.566
We're going to find her.

00:32.599 --> 00:34.568
It'll let us know if we make
a wrong move.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.069
Julius: Vi's counting on us.

00:53.287 --> 00:57.324
The Van Helsing must be killed.

00:58.458 --> 01:02.262
Bring her head and the amulet.

01:02.296 --> 01:07.901
Our master, the Dark One,
commands it.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.103
Where do I find her?

01:11.038 --> 01:13.407
She nears.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.345
Seek her out or your fate
will be worse

01:18.378 --> 01:21.081
than your former master's.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.984
The Van Helsing is said
to be powerful.

01:24.017 --> 01:27.054
Some even say immortal.

01:27.087 --> 01:31.425
A child without a head
is a threat to no one.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.894
If I do what assurance
do I have

01:33.927 --> 01:36.029
the Dark One won't
still destroy me?

01:36.063 --> 01:42.502
The only assurance you have
is your death should you fail.

01:42.536 --> 01:47.107
It will be slow and agonizing.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.076
I will see to that.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.410
Kill the Van Helsing.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.546
Bring me the amulet.

01:52.579 --> 01:55.082
There is no other path.

01:57.317 --> 01:58.318
[groans]

02:02.389 --> 02:05.025
You really think we can defeat
the Van Helsing?

02:05.058 --> 02:06.560
What choice do we have?

02:06.593 --> 02:07.494
We flee here.

02:07.527 --> 02:10.097
Find a distant territory
beyond her reach.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.365
Fool!

02:11.398 --> 02:16.203
Nowhere is beyond the reach
of the Dark One and Bathory.

02:16.236 --> 02:20.607
We will do what
the Dark One commands.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.809
We will kill the Van Helsing.

What the hell are you doing?

It's a call in the Sisterhood
we used to signal an attack,

03:22.903 --> 03:25.172
or to find one another
if we ever got separated.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.473

03:26.506 --> 03:27.841
They're gone.

I still have hope

I'll hear an answer.

And I won't be the last of

keep that hope on the inside.

03:59.439 --> 04:05.278
we were feared by every vampire

04:07.581 --> 04:11.585

when we were kids.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.695
History of what?

07:41.728 --> 07:44.664
Way back, America was at war
with the British.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.099
Yeah, now I remember.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.968
We were drawn to the bloodshed.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.137
We fed on the dying.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.640
The revolutionaries were
so scared that the British

07:53.673 --> 07:57.077
were gonna take all the church
bells, melt them for weapons,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.679
so a group of patriots gathered
them all up and hid them.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.647
Hid them where?

08:00.680 --> 08:01.915
A church.

08:01.948 --> 08:05.885
Still existed pre‐rising,
even after hundreds of years.

08:09.022 --> 08:13.460
Jack made our father take us.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.931
It‐ it's probably not far away.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.599
You know, if it's still
there now?

08:19.632 --> 08:24.004

to set foot in such a place.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.073
That's the path Jack
has led us down.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.508
She might have hid
something there.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.844
In the past.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.748
Before... she um...

08:37.017 --> 08:39.986
But her inscription,
it led us here.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.921
Because only I would know
the truth.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.759
The story between this monument
and the church.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.926
I'm right.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.596
I'm right.

08:51.498 --> 08:52.932

08:54.234 --> 08:56.403
As you wish, Sister.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.097
This is the place.

09:24.130 --> 09:24.931
Careful.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.801
Such a place can refuge
much darkness.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.780
It's here.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.516
Whatever it is, it's here.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.019
How can you be sure?

09:47.187 --> 09:49.956
Everything in my body
is screaming at me.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.158
I've learned to trust that.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.162
We have to search everywhere.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.964
How will we know when we see it?

09:57.997 --> 10:00.900
We don't even know
what we're looking for.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.002

We're mere mortals now
thanks to Blak‐Tek and the army.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.051
They figured out how
to make daywalkers

10:52.085 --> 10:54.154
and then they figured out
how to kill 'em.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.121
Mostly.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.992
That orange chemical shit
got all over us.

10:59.025 --> 11:02.929
Took our ability to heal and
almost killed us in the process.

its way across the country,

it's gonna show up.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.211

11:18.244 --> 11:19.979
Put that anywhere in
a daywalker's body

11:20.013 --> 11:21.014
and they're down for the count.

11:21.047 --> 11:24.150

11:24.184 --> 11:26.152

I only have a handful of those
so gotta conserve.

for someone special.

on the Dark One?

ruin the Oracle's day though.

we doing in here?

in the Dark Realm.

back to Jack's inscription
in the book.

interested in robbing graves.

it's probably in here.

down here.

but I need to get what's
inside that wall.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.537
Easy, pal.

it with his brains.

for over 200 years.

something in that wall

23:30.876 --> 23:33.245
So we turn the Oracle,

then she can read this and

Keep going! Keep going!

29:46.885 --> 29:48.620
I'm not leaving you.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.155
God, you're just as stubborn
as your mother.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.189
Thanks.

29:52.958 --> 29:53.992
Come on, let's go.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.661
Hey! Hurry up!

29:55.694 --> 29:56.695
Come on!

29:56.728 --> 29:57.763
Come on!

29:57.796 --> 29:58.764
Go! Go!

29:58.797 --> 30:00.666
Come on! Come on!

30:00.699 --> 30:01.133
No!

30:01.166 --> 30:02.734
[crash]

30:04.136 --> 30:05.237
Diaz!

30:05.270 --> 30:06.238
Vi!

30:06.271 --> 30:08.140
Goddammit!

30:32.164 --> 30:34.366
Take the amulet.

30:34.399 --> 30:36.702
Take it.

30:39.071 --> 30:43.208
No matter what happens,
you finish this.

30:43.241 --> 30:44.576
Ok?

30:45.210 --> 30:46.878
I can't lose you again.

30:46.912 --> 30:48.213
Not like this.

30:48.246 --> 30:49.147
You're not gonna lose me.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.918
I found you before
and I'll find you again.

30:52.951 --> 30:53.919
Go!

30:54.286 --> 30:55.354
Go, take my sister.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.355
You better.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.590
Axel: Give 'em hell, big guy.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.992
Julius: You know it.

31:14.773 --> 31:17.309
[laboured breathing]

31:28.153 --> 31:30.756
[growling sounds]

31:35.327 --> 31:37.963
Van Helsing!

31:48.940 --> 31:50.442
What's that?

31:50.475 --> 31:58.116
This... this is me spinach.

32:03.388 --> 32:06.024
I think you should stand back
a little.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.011
[grunts]

32:28.713 --> 32:29.981
Julius?

32:30.015 --> 32:32.451
Julius?

32:32.484 --> 32:37.689
[growling]

32:53.805 --> 32:55.474
[growls]

33:04.382 --> 33:07.018
[growls]

33:07.052 --> 33:13.725
Give me the amulet and I will
kill you both quickly.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.875
Sic him.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.776
[charging grunts]

33:42.654 --> 33:43.655
[smash]

33:48.026 --> 33:52.030
[both snarling]

34:00.705 --> 34:02.307
[charging grunt]

34:05.310 --> 34:07.212
[choking]

34:07.245 --> 34:08.680
My turn.

34:16.254 --> 34:19.257
[fighting grunts]

34:24.896 --> 34:27.098
[smash]

34:28.166 --> 34:31.169
[fighting grunts]

34:36.241 --> 34:38.743
Maybe if I remove your teeth

34:38.777 --> 34:41.713
the Dark One would
prefer you alive.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.249
[thud]

34:46.985 --> 34:49.387
You gotta get through me first.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.304
Axel: Hey, Jack. Jack.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.139
We gotta go. We gotta
keep moving.

35:08.173 --> 35:10.208
Would Vanessa have
left her behind?

35:10.241 --> 35:11.276
If it meant accomplishing
the mission

35:11.309 --> 35:13.778
you bet your ass
she would have.

35:13.812 --> 35:18.316
The best thing you can do
right now is finish this thing.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.151
Finish it.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.786
They're gonna make it.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.154
I know.

35:24.155 --> 35:25.657
Ok.

35:50.281 --> 35:54.285
[fighting grunts]

36:02.060 --> 36:03.395
[smash]

36:17.509 --> 36:20.045
[fighting grunting]

36:31.256 --> 36:33.091
[groans]

36:34.526 --> 36:36.194
You're nothing.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.363
You probably would die
on your own.

36:38.396 --> 36:41.132
But where is the fun in that?

36:41.166 --> 36:42.300
Huh?

36:42.801 --> 36:43.768
[grunts]

36:45.937 --> 36:47.372
[grunts]

37:01.186 --> 37:03.421
[gasps]

37:08.460 --> 37:09.427
No!

37:10.562 --> 37:15.934
[sobbing] I'm gonna help you!
I'm gonna help you.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.436
I'm gonna figure this out.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.973
And I'll help you.

37:23.007 --> 37:27.011
It's over for me, kid.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.547
This was a one‐way ticket.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.251
Why?

37:33.284 --> 37:34.919
I had to.

37:34.953 --> 37:37.989
It was the only way
to save you.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.561
I did good?

37:43.595 --> 37:45.430
You did great.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.065
You did so great.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.933
Yeah, I did good.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.535
But you're gonna be ok.

37:50.568 --> 37:52.537
I'm gonna‐ I'm gonna
figure this out.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.472
No.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.474
This was the last time.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.213
Hey.

38:02.247 --> 38:06.417
It's ok, Violet.

38:06.451 --> 38:10.121
I ain't afraid of dying.

38:10.155 --> 38:16.127
You, Jack, Vanessa.

38:16.161 --> 38:18.496
You‐ you gave my life purpose.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.468
Thank you.

38:25.236 --> 38:28.540
[sobbing]

38:30.141 --> 38:34.245
Listen to me, ok?

38:34.279 --> 38:38.316
You find the Dark One and then
you bite that bitch.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.418
You got me?

38:40.451 --> 38:41.419
I got you.

38:41.452 --> 38:44.989
End this for all of us.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.160
For all of us.

38:59.003 --> 39:02.640
[sobbing]

39:02.674 --> 39:04.008
Julius?

39:10.982 --> 39:15.186
No!!!!!

39:15.220 --> 39:19.224
[Violet screaming]

39:23.928 --> 39:25.263
Violet.

39:32.437 --> 39:34.439
Ok, I think t

39:35.006 --> 39:36.241
I think we're safe.

39:36.274 --> 39:39.177
Nah, we gotta keep putting
distance between us and them.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.412
We need to rest.

39:41.446 --> 39:42.981
I mean, what good are we

39:43.014 --> 39:44.549
if we lack the strength
to raise our weapons?

39:44.582 --> 39:46.384
You don't need to raise them
if we keep moving.

39:46.417 --> 39:47.919
Listen.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.222
I don't follow you, ok?

39:51.256 --> 39:53.024
I follow Jack.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.928
Look.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.197
I just need a minute.

40:01.666 --> 40:04.435
Alright, you got five.

40:04.469 --> 40:05.970
That's it.

40:12.143 --> 40:14.112
So you felt that, too,
back there?

40:14.145 --> 40:15.480
Yeah.

40:15.713 --> 40:16.748
I mean, Violet.

40:16.781 --> 40:21.452
Her pain, I... I never felt
anything like that.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.089
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

40:25.123 --> 40:28.059
Hey.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.295
She could have survived.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.501
I mean, can you look
at everything

40:36.534 --> 40:40.705
that you've been through to get
here, to be here in this moment?

40:40.738 --> 40:45.543
You of all people know
anything is possible.

40:45.576 --> 40:46.644
Yeah.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.546
Ok, alright.
Come on, let's go.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.181
We gotta go.

40:58.423 --> 41:02.393
[Violet screaming]

41:02.427 --> 41:04.162
What the hell was that?

41:09.133 --> 41:12.036
[screaming]

41:12.370 --> 41:13.371
Axel: What the hell
are you doing?

41:13.404 --> 41:17.108
[Violet screaming]

41:17.141 --> 41:19.577
[screaming]

41:23.314 --> 41:25.717
[screaming]

41:25.750 --> 41:26.551
Vi!

41:26.584 --> 41:28.186
Jack!

41:32.590 --> 41:35.293
I thought you were dead.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.495
I'm a Van Helsing.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.497
Axel: Where's Julius?

41:44.335 --> 41:48.806
He sacrificed himself
to save me.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.777
So we could both finish this.

42:06.391 --> 42:08.226
He was a good friend.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.133
[sighs]

42:16.801 --> 42:18.770
Violet: Let's go kill
the Dark One.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.806
For Julius.

42:22.673 --> 42:25.510
And all those that died
because of her.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.114
I've waited 300 years
for another shot at her.

42:31.749 --> 42:34.085
Oorah.

42:39.857 --> 42:42.794
[screaming]

42:45.463 --> 42:49.300
[screaming]

42:51.803 --> 42:54.672
[screaming]
