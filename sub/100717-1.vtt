00:28.208 --> 00:32.833
This film was shot at original locations of X-jam Croatia on
Lanterna Peninsula

01:22.833 --> 01:24.750
School is over!

01:25.000 --> 01:28.916
Each year thousands of young adults
meet to celebrate for an entire week.

01:31.333 --> 01:34.833
A party they will never forget.

01:43.833 --> 01:48.041
PARTY HARD, DIE YOUNG

02:54.333 --> 02:55.291
GROUP BEST CLASS EVER

03:01.791 --> 03:04.041
Cheesy, no one wants to know
where your room is.

03:04.208 --> 03:05.875
Nice hat, class rep.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.458
Down it, or you won't get laid.

03:14.833 --> 03:17.208
Ha, you can't handle it!

03:17.375 --> 03:19.583
Dude, you guys are so gay!

03:21.041 --> 03:23.125
Shut up, Barbie!

03:23.416 --> 03:24.958
Look what a nerd I am.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.291
Uhh, our own bloggers.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.166
#victim

03:31.333 --> 03:32.666
#lowbrow

03:38.708 --> 03:40.333
#instavictim

03:44.416 --> 03:45.916
Indulgence!

04:04.708 --> 04:07.500
How am I supposed to survive this week?

04:16.166 --> 04:18.208
Is someone hung over?

04:23.375 --> 04:25.958
Look, drink something!
-Yuk, Julia!

04:27.291 --> 04:29.125
Hey, I have to tell you something.

04:32.708 --> 04:35.333
You reek!
Could you please brush your teeth?

04:38.500 --> 04:40.458
Mom again...

04:41.208 --> 04:42.625
Come on, give it to me!

04:46.125 --> 04:49.583
Hello, Renate. This is Julia.
Jessy's in the shower.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.458
Of course it's just the two of us
in a room.

04:57.416 --> 05:00.541
We'll be careful with the alcohol.
Don't worry.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.041
Sure, I'll watch out for her.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.875
Ok, bye!

05:13.500 --> 05:14.916
She sends her love.

05:15.666 --> 05:17.083
Thank you!

05:18.583 --> 05:21.791
I'll be so relieved
to finally be back in Vienna with you.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.166
I've got something for us.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.666
Taadaa!
-What is it?

05:41.625 --> 05:44.541
I stole it from my mom's medicine cabinet.

05:48.250 --> 05:51.291
Whoa!
-It's for tonight!

06:18.166 --> 06:20.583
You know, I'm moving to Vienna, too,
in the fall.

06:20.916 --> 06:23.083
In case you need another flatmate.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.208
I can help you shower every day.

06:37.833 --> 06:40.083
Samy?
-No, thanks.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.666
Why are you even here if you don't drink?

06:43.208 --> 06:46.208
I have my reasons.
-Oh, Samy has secrets.

06:46.833 --> 06:49.375
Not everyone's here just for
the drinking and banging.

06:49.541 --> 06:52.666
Really?
You know, fat-camp is somewhere else.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.833
Get that thing out of my face.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.000
Are you deaf or what?

07:01.250 --> 07:03.875
Give me back my phone, stupid cow!

07:04.625 --> 07:06.916
Are you class 8B
from Keimgasse high school?

07:09.083 --> 07:14.833
Looks like you feel right at home already.
My name's Felix, this is Leo.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.625
We just have a brief update for you:

07:17.791 --> 07:20.625
The big beach party starts at 8 pm
down here.

07:21.416 --> 07:24.583
The parties at the arena start at midnight.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.333
After that, the beach is closed,
for everyone.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.583
What? Why?
-We can't change it.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.416
We have 8 wristbands for
the first secret party tomorrow night.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.125
But we're more than 8.
-There's 11 of us.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.500
No worries, we'll have more wristbands
for the other parties.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.083
Any questions?

07:40.416 --> 07:43.916
Is it true that you team members aren't
allowed to hook up with the graduates?

07:44.083 --> 07:48.416
First of all, that's true.
Secondly, we're a gang, not a team.

07:48.916 --> 07:51.958
And you are?
-First of all, I'm Alexia Schober.

07:52.125 --> 07:55.916
Secondly, friends and gang members
call me Lexi.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.750
Friends call her "Licksy".

08:00.291 --> 08:05.041
Have a great week, and if you have
questions, come by the info point, ok?

08:05.375 --> 08:06.500
Have fun!
-Bye!

08:08.541 --> 08:09.791
They're so hot!

08:10.500 --> 08:12.166
Who gets a wristband?

08:12.500 --> 08:14.708
Each girl gets one.
-Great idea.

08:15.500 --> 08:19.166
You gentlemen can fight for the rest.
-No way!

08:23.125 --> 08:26.958
I would suggest
that every girl who blows me gets one!

08:27.291 --> 08:29.625
How about it, Andi?
-Stop!

08:33.916 --> 08:36.666
You really have to tell her.
-What?

08:37.458 --> 08:41.583
Come on, everyone knows
you're going to Munich and not to Vienna.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.833
I know...

08:44.375 --> 08:45.750
It won't get any easier.

09:20.208 --> 09:23.083
8B, 8B, 8B!

09:41.666 --> 09:44.166
And here are the best 'Pics of the Day'!

09:45.000 --> 09:46.583
Somebody was feeling hot.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.916
He dumped his wife.

09:53.333 --> 09:57.250
Here is some involuntary body painting,

09:57.583 --> 10:00.875
proving that there
really is only one thing on your mind.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.666
Hey, that's me!

10:09.375 --> 10:14.416
I dare you to fall asleep near me.
-That's not going to happen soon.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.916
Cool, now you're the most popular
dick around here!

10:18.625 --> 10:20.125
Want a drink?
-Yes.

10:20.291 --> 10:25.208
This "genital" artwork
is the perfect transition to a message

10:25.416 --> 10:27.791
that is really important to me
and your parents.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.083
You can't stress it enough
with you young people:

10:31.250 --> 10:34.833
Please, always use
sunscreen with SPF 50.

10:35.166 --> 10:40.750
That guarantees that this will be a week
you will never forget.

10:40.916 --> 10:45.916
And how does it go?
-X-Jam! X-Jam! X-Jam!

11:00.750 --> 11:01.916
Cheers!
-Cheers!

11:04.250 --> 11:06.083
The next round's on me!

11:06.375 --> 11:09.666
I'd rather you invite me to Oktoberfest
when you've moved to Munich.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.375
Why? Didn't you and Jessica
want to move to Vienna?

11:13.958 --> 11:15.333
Munich?

11:16.750 --> 11:19.208
I passed the entry exams!

11:24.500 --> 11:26.833
Great! Thanks, Bogi.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.333
Jessy, I'm really sorry.

11:32.666 --> 11:35.125
How long have you known?
-For a week or so.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.666
You've told Bogi, but not me?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I really wanted to tell you,
but you would've been mad the entire week.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.250
So now it's my fault?
-No, but if it's so important to you...

11:44.500 --> 11:46.875
... then I just won't tell her
and let her die stupid?

11:47.208 --> 11:49.291
Jessy, come on.
This is just about a stupid apartment.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.208
Fuck the apartment!
That's not what this is about.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.833
I thought we trusted each other.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.416
Calm down! What was I supposed to do?

11:56.583 --> 11:59.166
I told you from the beginning
that I'd try to get in.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.833
Just because
you want to share a stupid flat, I can't...

12:02.166 --> 12:04.416
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

12:04.583 --> 12:08.708
Sure you did. In the end you always do
what benefits you most.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.333
You know what?

12:11.333 --> 12:12.791
Fuck "best friends"!

12:14.041 --> 12:15.333
Jessy, come on.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.041
Jessy, stop it! That's really stupid.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.625
Why? Are you worried
you'll have to take care of me?

12:21.958 --> 12:24.166
Give that to me!

12:24.750 --> 12:26.916
Great! Well done!
-Shit, I'm sorry.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.208
Here, take it. Have fun!

12:37.708 --> 12:39.500
Is she still mad?

12:39.666 --> 12:42.666
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

12:42.958 --> 12:45.083
Who cares?
I can't plan my whole life around her.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.333
What is that?

12:51.666 --> 12:53.875
Julia, be careful with that stuff!

12:54.208 --> 12:55.875
Leave me alone, Bogi!

13:50.791 --> 13:52.041
Are you feeling good?

13:55.083 --> 13:56.083
Yes.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.083
I can see that.

14:01.291 --> 14:03.083
I feel fantastic!

14:05.625 --> 14:08.250
Want to go outside
and drink something? Water?

14:09.750 --> 14:11.125
Yeah? Come on!

14:18.416 --> 14:19.875
You all right?

14:20.041 --> 14:21.541
Are you sure?

14:32.708 --> 14:34.125
Shit!

14:37.250 --> 14:39.291
Please, leave me alone!

16:48.833 --> 16:50.041
Morning.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.875
Did you sleep here?

17:02.458 --> 17:06.083
Yeah, Lexi brought a guy back to our room.
Should I have joined them?

17:06.666 --> 17:08.208
And what about Jessy?

17:08.541 --> 17:10.375
She wasn't here.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.208
She was standing over there.

17:45.958 --> 17:47.958
And that's where the guy came from.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.708
Shouldn't we call the police?
-The police? Why?

17:53.041 --> 17:54.125
To report it.

17:54.916 --> 17:57.333
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it,

17:57.750 --> 18:00.541
but do you even know how you
got home last night?

18:02.541 --> 18:05.250
You were lying over there
and you didn't look like

18:05.583 --> 18:08.583
you knew what was going on.
-You took me home?

18:09.625 --> 18:11.291
Felix for Nadja, please.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.791
Sorry.
Felix, here.

18:34.916 --> 18:38.500
Hi, this is Jessica.
Leave a message after the beep.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.958
Hey, you faggot, get up!

19:20.208 --> 19:22.458
Dude, you're the gay one!

19:23.125 --> 19:24.125
Fag!

19:24.458 --> 19:25.500
Morning!

19:25.666 --> 19:28.291
I hear you have a sick sunburn?
-Yes, I do. Thanks!

19:28.458 --> 19:30.416
Cheesy, scoot over.
-Sit down!

19:30.916 --> 19:33.458
I need to get Leo's number.

19:33.791 --> 19:35.541
Who?
-That guy is so hot!

19:35.708 --> 19:37.583
Look, 177 likes.

19:38.041 --> 19:39.041
Awesome!

19:39.958 --> 19:42.416
You guys went on the roof?
Are we allowed up there?

19:42.750 --> 19:45.083
No, Leo almost sent us home.

19:45.416 --> 19:48.666
Luckily, Lexi had some strong
arguments to convince him.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.833
What did you do, give him a blowjob?

20:01.041 --> 20:03.541
Well...
-Blowjob? I've come just in time.

20:03.708 --> 20:06.625
You'll never come with any of us, Cheesy.
Not for real, anyway.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.333
Cheesy, are you done anytime soon?

20:11.083 --> 20:13.666
Yeah, wait. I'm almost done showering.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.416
Morning!

20:22.166 --> 20:24.208
Hey, did you guys see Jessica?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.375
Hey, has anybody seen Jessica?

20:35.708 --> 20:39.250
Guys, have you seen Jessica?
-Did you check her bed?

20:40.291 --> 20:41.333
Seriously?

20:41.500 --> 20:44.458
She's disappeared and isn't answering.
I've looked everywhere.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.625
And I saw her in the forest last night.

20:46.916 --> 20:50.291
Something was off.
She was with some guy who attacked her.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.875
What kind of guy?
-He had a weird face.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.458
Calm down and listen.
She just sent me a text.

20:56.708 --> 20:58.916
"I'm in Rovinj with ...,
don't worry about me.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.208
As long as we don't run out of condoms ;)"

21:01.541 --> 21:02.958
Fucking!

21:03.291 --> 21:04.958
Jessica would never write that.

21:05.166 --> 21:08.125
Are you jealous
because she texted me and not you?

21:08.333 --> 21:10.541
What if she's still mad about
the fight yesterday,

21:10.708 --> 21:12.333
and that's why she didn't text?

21:12.500 --> 21:14.458
Can I read that again?

21:14.625 --> 21:16.541
Seriously? Look!

21:17.041 --> 21:21.208
That fat cow is wearing the same bikini
as I am. I'm going to make her pay.

21:21.416 --> 21:23.125
It suits her better than you.
-Really?

21:23.291 --> 21:24.875
It really suits her.
-Then go fuck her.

21:25.208 --> 21:27.583
It really does.

21:30.708 --> 21:34.333
Sorry, but what's wrong with
Jessica wanting to have some fun for once?

21:35.166 --> 21:38.208
Jessica is still a virgin.
Do you really think she would just

21:38.416 --> 21:41.041
take off with some random guy?
To Rovinj?

21:41.208 --> 21:43.291
And who is "dot, dot, dot"?

21:43.916 --> 21:47.166
Well, it wouldn't be the first time
Jessica has run away.

21:48.625 --> 21:50.750
Hey, that virgin thing
stays between us, ok?

21:51.791 --> 21:54.125
We have a winner!
It's Stefan,

21:54.291 --> 21:57.041
our 'King of X-Jam'!

21:58.000 --> 22:00.291
A round of applause for Stefan!

22:01.833 --> 22:04.416
And the tension is rising for the girls.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.208
These girls signed up
to become the 'Queen of X-Jam'.

22:07.541 --> 22:10.416
Laura and Sophie!

22:12.916 --> 22:15.000
Third is Belli.

22:18.875 --> 22:22.250
Then there is Angi.
Angi!

22:22.583 --> 22:26.208
And last but not least: Carmen!

22:30.583 --> 22:31.958
Where's Carmen?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.541
Carmen Hipfl, please.
-There she is!

22:45.541 --> 22:47.875
Carmen, you don't have to go up there.

22:51.041 --> 22:54.208
Ok, if she's not coming, no problem.
-Hold this!

22:54.541 --> 22:57.750
There she is!
Give it up for Carmen!

24:18.416 --> 24:20.250
Give it up for Carmen!

24:22.958 --> 24:24.041
Give it up!

24:31.333 --> 24:33.041
Hi Jessy, uh...

24:35.041 --> 24:36.666
... please call me back.

24:38.125 --> 24:39.833
I'm so sorry.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.041
I wanted... I don't know.

24:42.666 --> 24:44.541
I... well...

24:44.875 --> 24:46.666
So if you're in Rovinj then...

24:47.083 --> 24:51.125
... please call me back. I get that you
don't want to be with me right now, but...

24:51.833 --> 24:55.333
But please call me, ok?
I'm worried about you.

25:14.166 --> 25:16.375
Hey guys, what's up?

25:17.458 --> 25:22.125
I'm at the X-Jam Secret Party
and it's really...

25:27.041 --> 25:29.375
Should I ask him to film us?

25:29.708 --> 25:31.541
Maybe we'll become YouTube stars.

25:38.958 --> 25:41.250
Just leave him alone.

25:46.208 --> 25:49.791
I didn't think Carmen had it in her.
Amazing!

26:01.583 --> 26:05.500
Hey Denise, come up to the roof!
Surprise ;) Kisses, Jessy

26:09.333 --> 26:12.500
I have to go somewhere.
-And where is "somewhere"?

26:12.666 --> 26:13.666
Denise?

27:17.125 --> 27:20.041
Stop fucking around, Jessica.
I can hear your phone.

27:20.208 --> 27:22.208
Come on, quit it.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.958
Julia is really worried about you.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.625
It's not funny anymore.

27:31.541 --> 27:33.083
Seriously?

27:39.416 --> 27:40.666
New video received

28:06.458 --> 28:08.541
What the fuck?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.250
Julia!

28:52.000 --> 28:54.083
Julia, help! Help!

29:41.041 --> 29:42.625
Cheers!

30:10.291 --> 30:11.916
It's Denise!

30:37.541 --> 30:41.666
There's not much I can tell you.
The police think this was an accident.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.291
That's all we know for now.
I understand if some of you want to go home.

30:46.625 --> 30:50.958
We will take care of the cost, of course.
If you have any questions,

30:51.125 --> 30:53.666
Felix and Leo are here for you.

30:55.583 --> 30:57.416
My condolences.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.708
How can someone just fall down from there?

31:03.875 --> 31:07.250
Or how she even got up there.
-She's been up there before.

31:07.583 --> 31:09.416
Do you think she committed...

31:09.583 --> 31:12.666
I mean...
-No, why would she?

31:12.958 --> 31:15.000
There's no use in speculating.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.708
As class rep, I would say...

31:17.875 --> 31:20.416
... everyone who wants to leave
says so now.

31:20.583 --> 31:25.083
I'm not going home before Jessy comes back.
Maybe something happened to her, too.

31:25.416 --> 31:26.708
Come on...

31:26.875 --> 31:30.166
Well, I don't want to stay. I'm going home.

31:30.333 --> 31:33.416
Do you think Denise would have
wanted everyone to go home?

31:33.583 --> 31:37.250
Do you want to party like nothing happened?
I definitely don't.

31:37.416 --> 31:40.916
Great! Even now she manages
to screw up everything.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.791
What a terrible thing to say.

31:43.125 --> 31:46.375
You think now that you're 'Queen'
you can do whatever you want?

31:46.750 --> 31:48.708
Sorry, it just kind of slipped out.

31:49.833 --> 31:51.416
And it's kind of true.

31:51.958 --> 31:57.166
I'd say that the people who want to go home
come to the info desk in two hours,

31:57.666 --> 32:00.916
and we'll book tickets
for the evening ferry.

32:02.916 --> 32:04.916
Jessy, please call me back.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.458
Something terrible has happened,

32:07.625 --> 32:09.750
and I'm worried about you, ok?

32:09.916 --> 32:13.166
Call me back. Kisses.

32:36.875 --> 32:39.166
Hello, this is
the mailbox of Denise Petrovic.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.541
I'm not available right now,
but please leave a message after the...

32:59.916 --> 33:00.916
Felix?

33:01.875 --> 33:04.125
Julia, how are you?

33:04.708 --> 33:08.125
I wanted to ask if you know
whether they found Denise's phone on her?

33:08.833 --> 33:10.958
As far as I know, they didn't.
Why?

33:11.458 --> 33:12.625
Could you do me a favor?

33:26.041 --> 33:29.583
If anyone finds out that I let you up here,
I'll be in big trouble.

33:29.791 --> 33:32.500
She got a text
and was really secretive about it.

33:32.833 --> 33:34.875
And I just got a picture from her.

33:35.041 --> 33:37.208
You got a picture from her?

33:56.041 --> 33:58.333
Let's go, before anyone sees us.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.125
Come on, please!

34:21.166 --> 34:22.416
Is it Denise's?

34:23.500 --> 34:24.500
No idea.

34:26.083 --> 34:28.541
Julia, let's go, please!
Come on.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.958
Hey.
-Hey, Samy.

34:47.458 --> 34:50.833
Are you coming to our memorial service?
-Of course.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.500
Shit.

36:52.875 --> 36:56.041
Can you say something for once?
Honestly! I mean...

36:57.500 --> 36:59.375
Julia, calm down.

37:16.041 --> 37:17.750
Sorry.

37:58.125 --> 37:59.291
To you, Denise!

37:59.458 --> 38:02.333
To you, Denise.
-To you, Denise.

38:16.708 --> 38:18.875
What are you still doing here?
Didn't you want to go home?

38:19.083 --> 38:23.125
There was no more room on the ferry.
I'll take the one in the morning.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.750
Why are you this late?
-I went to the police.

38:27.083 --> 38:29.000
The police?
-Yes.

38:29.916 --> 38:33.166
I didn't imagine the thing
with Jessica in the forest.

38:33.625 --> 38:37.916
I got pictures on Snapchat of Jessica
and Denise with their faces scratched out.

38:38.125 --> 38:40.958
What? Let's see.
-They're deleted.

38:41.125 --> 38:45.041
Didn't you take a screenshot?
-No, but I also found Jessica's room key.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.083
Why should someone send you
pictures like that?

38:47.416 --> 38:50.583
Because they were killed.
-Here she goes again.

38:50.916 --> 38:54.541
You really need attention, don't you?
-Not at all!

38:54.708 --> 38:57.000
Why are you attacking me right now?
I'm...

38:57.333 --> 38:59.791
First you're late,
then you start with this shit again?

38:59.958 --> 39:03.125
I'm late because I was with the police!
-We're here for Denise, ok?

39:03.291 --> 39:05.958
The police said the thing with Denise
was an accident.

39:06.125 --> 39:09.666
And Jessica is still in Rovinj.
-And what if she's not?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.041
What if it was meant
to look like an accident?

39:12.208 --> 39:15.291
Do you think someone is running around
who "Knows What You Did Last Summer"?

39:15.500 --> 39:19.416
Maybe we're all dead
and this is all an illusion or whatever.

39:19.625 --> 39:23.833
What's wrong with you guys? Don't you care
that we don't know where Jessy is?

39:24.041 --> 39:25.958
Of course we care.
-Why are you attacking us now?

39:26.166 --> 39:28.125
I'm done with this shit.
-Can we stop?

39:28.291 --> 39:30.333
Anyone want to join me at the bar?
-Sure!

39:33.041 --> 39:36.250
How can you think about partying
and act like nothing happened?

39:36.500 --> 39:39.875
What else are we supposed to do?
Stay in our rooms and cry?

39:40.041 --> 39:44.458
Then go get drunk, if you need it.
-Come on, let's not fight, ok?

39:45.458 --> 39:46.500
No, thanks.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.500
Fine. Whatever.

40:24.625 --> 40:25.916
This is Luki, hello?

40:27.125 --> 40:28.333
Yes?

40:30.416 --> 40:31.541
Really?

40:32.750 --> 40:34.208
Ok, I'll hurry.

40:44.083 --> 40:48.083
Hey, there's a space on tonight's ferry
after all, so I'll be leaving now.

40:49.208 --> 40:52.416
Are you sure you want to leave?
-Yes, all of this is a bit too much for me.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.166
Sure...
-I have to hurry.

40:55.333 --> 40:58.833
Tell the others bye from me. Bye!
-Bye, Luki

41:00.541 --> 41:01.625
Bye!

42:38.583 --> 42:41.458
Hey, your performance was so cool.
We made a crown for you.

42:41.625 --> 42:42.625
Thanks!

42:44.333 --> 42:46.750
Can we take a selfie with you?
-Sure.

42:51.041 --> 42:53.625
Awesome, thanks!
-No problem.

43:00.625 --> 43:03.208
Hey, Carmen!
Do you have fans now?

43:04.333 --> 43:06.250
Can I have a selfie with you, too?
-Yes.

43:06.416 --> 43:09.333
With the Queen. Is that ok?
-Sure.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.416
Show us what you've got.

43:14.041 --> 43:17.666
Don't you want to put on the crown?
And show some cleavage.

43:19.750 --> 43:22.125
Yes. Beautiful.

43:23.041 --> 43:24.750
Now you'll get a kiss.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.041
Andi, come on. Another kiss.

43:29.208 --> 43:31.583
Yes, that's it!

43:31.916 --> 43:33.791
Knock it off!
-Don't be like that now.

43:33.958 --> 43:36.958
First you show off your tits,
now you're the good housewife?

43:38.875 --> 43:40.333
What's up with you?

43:40.583 --> 43:43.625
Do you think you're the shit now,
because of that 'Queen' bullshit?

43:43.791 --> 43:46.583
Andi, come on.
-You can be glad I'm touching you at all.

43:46.750 --> 43:47.958
Calm down, Andi!

43:48.416 --> 43:51.666
You're so crazy when you're drunk.
-Calm down!

43:52.750 --> 43:54.291
Sleep off your hangover.

44:13.625 --> 44:15.125
Hello? Who are you?

44:20.333 --> 44:22.208
What do you want from me?

44:32.166 --> 44:34.000
Truth or dare?

44:34.666 --> 44:35.750
Dare!

44:36.250 --> 44:38.083
Finally, here we go!

44:40.375 --> 44:41.666
Anna?

44:43.708 --> 44:47.541
Let me go! I didn't do anything!
Please!

44:47.916 --> 44:49.500
Please!

45:05.875 --> 45:07.666
Please, let me go!

45:08.000 --> 45:10.125
Finally, here we go!

45:16.208 --> 45:18.458
Are you ready?
-Yes.

45:32.708 --> 45:35.250
I was so looking forward to this week.

45:35.666 --> 45:39.000
I wanted to have a good time
with everyone before going to Munich.

45:39.500 --> 45:42.083
And now everything is so fucked up.

45:44.875 --> 45:47.083
I'm sorry I told her.

45:47.833 --> 45:50.083
I should've just told Jessica myself.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.666
Come on...

45:55.375 --> 45:56.791
... I have an idea.

45:59.666 --> 46:01.083
Come on!

46:19.041 --> 46:20.333
Shall we go for a swim?

46:21.458 --> 46:22.458
No.

46:23.916 --> 46:25.291
No.

46:27.041 --> 46:28.416
Come on...

46:29.875 --> 46:33.125
Come on!
-Bogi. Put your clothes back on, please.

46:34.666 --> 46:37.000
Julia.
-I want to leave.

46:57.666 --> 46:58.750
Shit...

47:19.958 --> 47:21.000
Shit!

47:37.208 --> 47:40.208
Are you insane?
-Sorry, I didn't want...

47:40.375 --> 47:42.375
Just shut up!
-Julia...

47:42.541 --> 47:44.000
... shit!

47:45.166 --> 47:47.291
Julia! Fuck...

48:38.875 --> 48:41.083
My mom has called twice already.

48:41.375 --> 48:43.500
I don't know what to tell her.

48:49.375 --> 48:51.583
I'm so sorry.

48:52.791 --> 48:55.916
If I hadn't been so drunk that night
I could've helped Jessy.

48:56.625 --> 48:59.333
Then she might still be alive...

49:03.208 --> 49:05.375
Are you ok?
-Yes.

49:06.500 --> 49:09.458
The police have some more questions.
Is that all right?

49:09.666 --> 49:11.166
Yes, that's fine.

49:11.750 --> 49:14.875
All right, there's a lot going on
right now, I'm sorry.

49:15.208 --> 49:17.291
The event is cancelled for now,

49:17.458 --> 49:21.041
and the police would like to talk
to each of you, ok?

49:22.083 --> 49:25.625
Right, one of you wanted to catch
the ferry today, but that won't be possible.

49:25.791 --> 49:29.333
The police have shut down
the ferry service for now.

49:29.625 --> 49:32.208
But Luki left last night already.

49:32.416 --> 49:35.291
No, there was no room left yesterday.
-What?

49:35.583 --> 49:38.416
We agreed that we would
take him to the morning ferry.

49:39.083 --> 49:43.041
But he left yesterday.
-I saw him leaving.

49:44.291 --> 49:46.708
What if something happened to Luki as well?

49:54.250 --> 49:57.541
Hi, Mom. Everything is fantastic here.
It's very hot.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.375
Really hot.
I've got a tan already.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.250
How are things back home?

50:04.416 --> 50:07.333
Yes, the parties are massive,
there are loads of people.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.541
I've never been out with so many people.

50:09.708 --> 50:12.750
The beach is beautiful, too.
The water is super clear.

50:19.583 --> 50:23.375
Other than that we're having a lot of fun.
I'm getting along with everyone.

50:23.541 --> 50:27.166
No problems to speak of.
It's really nice here.

50:27.500 --> 50:28.875
And...

50:29.375 --> 50:33.375
Everything's cool,
but I'm looking forward to coming home.

50:39.125 --> 50:42.083
Call me back when you get this. Kisses!

50:56.666 --> 50:58.500
Hey, everything all right with you?

50:59.916 --> 51:02.458
What's wrong?
-This is no longer a coincidence.

51:02.625 --> 51:05.625
I've gotten these pictures of everyone
who's dead or who disappeared.

51:05.791 --> 51:08.250
The thing with Denise was
definitely no accident.

51:08.416 --> 51:10.333
Do you think someone's targeting our class?

51:10.500 --> 51:12.291
No idea, but we have to leave.

51:13.083 --> 51:15.708
What's going on?
-We're on a fucking island.

51:15.875 --> 51:19.458
Do you want to swim?
We have to show this to the police.

51:19.791 --> 51:22.833
The police aren't taking me seriously.
And the other pictures got deleted.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.708
Listen, it's super easy to retrieve old
Snapchat photos. There are apps for that.

51:37.833 --> 51:38.958
Have a seat.

51:59.875 --> 52:03.250
You sure you don't have any nudes on here?
-Cheesy.

52:11.750 --> 52:12.750
Look.

52:14.458 --> 52:16.375
Thanks, you're the best.

52:31.208 --> 52:33.458
I could imagine
that Luki sent the picture himself.

52:33.625 --> 52:36.458
and is now having a nice time
without us somewhere.

52:36.625 --> 52:38.375
Why would he do that?

52:38.791 --> 52:41.208
Well, he doesn't know that Jessica...

52:42.750 --> 52:44.208
Well, that she...

52:55.625 --> 52:58.750
I'll be right back.
Make yourself at home.

53:22.208 --> 53:24.750
Luki? Fuck!

53:42.000 --> 53:43.666
Welcome to happy hour!

53:44.458 --> 53:47.791
Let me see what we have to mix this with.

53:59.041 --> 54:00.166
Here you go!

54:01.083 --> 54:02.666
Cheers.
-Cheers.

54:27.791 --> 54:30.250
Don't worry. I won't do anything.

54:30.458 --> 54:32.041
I wanted to leave anyway.

54:32.208 --> 54:34.791
Hey, sorry.
Come on, sit back down.

54:35.208 --> 54:36.958
No, Cheesy, I wanted to...

54:37.166 --> 54:39.541
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it. Sit down and...

54:47.333 --> 54:48.791
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

55:03.375 --> 55:05.000
Run! Run! Run! Run!

55:10.791 --> 55:13.625
Did you do the same
to Jessy and Denise, you psycho?

55:13.791 --> 55:16.541
Did you kill them
because they didn't put out?

55:18.916 --> 55:20.125
Are you ok?

55:29.583 --> 55:31.875
Julia, please! Tell them
I have nothing to do with this.

55:39.666 --> 55:41.375
What have I done?

55:46.375 --> 55:49.666
That's Luki's,
that's Denise's and that's Jessy's.

55:58.958 --> 56:02.208
Good news. The ferries are back in service,
and the events

56:02.750 --> 56:04.208
will continue as planned.

56:04.541 --> 56:05.750
Great news...

56:05.958 --> 56:07.666
Excuse me?
-Nothing.

56:08.541 --> 56:11.750
Obviously you think this is impious,

56:12.041 --> 56:15.166
but what am I supposed to do,
now that the matter has been solved?

56:15.500 --> 56:16.875
"The matter"...

56:17.083 --> 56:19.500
Girl, what's up with you?

56:19.666 --> 56:22.750
I have 5000 young adults on this island!

56:22.916 --> 56:26.291
Should I just send them all home?
Am I supposed to go broke because of you?

56:26.458 --> 56:28.875
I've never had a class like yours!
A bunch of lunatics!

56:29.041 --> 56:31.583
Can't you guys kill each other at home?

56:35.416 --> 56:39.000
Of course we will cover the costs
and arrange your trip home.

56:39.166 --> 56:42.500
No question there. Tomorrow morning
you'll be on the ferry home,

56:42.833 --> 56:46.500
so you can tell your parents not to worry.
That's the main thing.

56:47.916 --> 56:50.458
I'm not doing well
with all of this either.

56:50.625 --> 56:53.250
So please show some understanding.

56:53.875 --> 56:57.583
We have to stick together in this, ok?

57:06.833 --> 57:09.708
Hey, wait!
Where are you guys going?

57:10.041 --> 57:13.750
To my room to pack my things.
And Jessy's stuff, too.

57:15.666 --> 57:18.000
Do you want to stay with us?
-Would that be ok?

57:20.375 --> 57:22.291
Something doesn't seem right.

57:22.458 --> 57:24.958
What do you mean? Like what?

57:25.250 --> 57:28.750
Denise and Jessica probably
didn't put out and he freaked out.

57:29.750 --> 57:31.833
Ok, maybe, but what about Luki?

57:32.000 --> 57:33.208
It doesn't fit.

57:37.083 --> 57:38.250
Fuck!

57:38.458 --> 57:40.583
What?
-Cheesy couldn't have done it.

57:42.416 --> 57:45.458
I'm wondering why he decided
to send you these pictures.

57:45.791 --> 57:49.375
What do you mean?
-Well, Denise is still wearing braces.

57:55.291 --> 57:57.833
That was at sport camp
two years ago, right?

58:09.000 --> 58:10.250
You're right.

58:13.708 --> 58:16.416
Jessy, Denise,

58:17.125 --> 58:18.500
and Luki.

58:19.458 --> 58:23.583
The pictures I got on Snapchat
were all taken from this photograph.

58:25.083 --> 58:28.541
Did you guys keep in touch with Anna
after she left school?

58:28.708 --> 58:29.708
No.

58:30.875 --> 58:32.000
Wait, I'll check on Facebook.

58:32.666 --> 58:36.291
That's from the Secret Party,
right before Denise fell.

58:37.583 --> 58:38.583
Fuck!

58:39.125 --> 58:40.208
You're right!

58:40.458 --> 58:42.458
And what about the phones
under his bed?

58:42.625 --> 58:45.541
Somebody could have planted them there.
-Like who?

58:45.708 --> 58:48.583
No idea. Someone who has a key to his room.

58:49.125 --> 58:51.541
Maybe someone from the gang or the hotel.

58:51.708 --> 58:53.333
Or his roommate.

58:53.708 --> 58:54.708
Samy?

58:55.416 --> 58:58.458
Fuck, that's possible.
Did you guys see his latest blog entry?

58:58.791 --> 59:00.750
Anna deleted me as friend.

59:01.375 --> 59:03.875
Check your profiles!
I don't have Facebook.

59:13.125 --> 59:14.750
You are still friends.

59:17.833 --> 59:20.291
But Anna hasn't posted anything in ages.

59:20.625 --> 59:21.875
At least a few months.

59:22.041 --> 59:23.416
"You will live in our hearts forever."

59:23.583 --> 59:25.291
"So nice to have shared
part of your journey. Theresia."

59:25.458 --> 59:26.541
"Infinite sadness.
Thinking of Anna."

59:26.916 --> 59:27.958
Shit...

59:28.125 --> 59:29.833
"Why, dearest Anna?
How could it come to this?"

59:30.166 --> 59:32.083
Did she kill herself?

59:33.250 --> 59:39.041
Yes, and I will keep you guys up to date
with videos and pictures from the trip.

59:40.291 --> 59:42.791
There'll be a little surprise
at the end of the week.

59:43.125 --> 59:45.333
And everything will be different.

59:47.041 --> 59:49.083
Look, there's another one.

59:50.875 --> 59:51.875
Watch!

59:52.208 --> 59:54.333
Get that thing out of my face!

59:59.666 --> 1:00:00.666
Shit!

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.041
Fuck, maybe all of this is connected?

1:00:03.833 --> 1:00:05.041
Come on!

1:00:05.291 --> 1:00:07.791
Calm down. Maybe she died naturally.

1:00:13.916 --> 1:00:14.916
What's wrong?

1:00:15.750 --> 1:00:18.916
Anna was acting so strange
after that night at sport camp.

1:00:19.583 --> 1:00:21.625
She was always a little strange.

1:00:22.208 --> 1:00:25.291
But not like that. She didn't talk at all,
until she was just gone one day.

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:29.291
What did you guys do to her?
-Nothing. We played spin the bottle.

1:00:30.625 --> 1:00:34.625
Don't look at me. I wasn't even there.
-And I was very drunk.

1:00:34.791 --> 1:00:36.083
What about her?

1:00:36.416 --> 1:00:39.416
No idea. I wasn't her babysitter.

1:00:42.458 --> 1:00:47.083
Guys, Samy is still friends with her.
He even posted something back then.

1:00:47.416 --> 1:00:49.375
"Anna, you shall not be forgotten"

1:00:59.291 --> 1:01:01.333
Julia, it wasn't Cheesy. It's Samy!

1:01:03.083 --> 1:01:05.375
Julia, can you hear me? Where are you?

1:01:05.708 --> 1:01:07.916
I'm in my room with Lexi and Carmen.

1:01:08.250 --> 1:01:10.250
Lock the door and don't let anyone in.
-We have to go!

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:12.750
Guys!
-I'll call right back.

1:01:13.875 --> 1:01:14.958
Everything all right?

1:01:15.125 --> 1:01:17.791
We're just looking for Samy.
He's got something of ours.

1:01:21.916 --> 1:01:24.250
I think I saw him at the sauna party.

1:01:37.750 --> 1:01:38.750
Julia! It's me, Samy.

1:01:43.791 --> 1:01:46.458
I have to talk to you.
It's about Anna.

1:01:49.416 --> 1:01:50.416
The light!

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:54.750
I can hear you.
Open the door!

1:01:58.833 --> 1:02:01.333
Julia, open the fucking door!

1:02:07.666 --> 1:02:12.166
Bogi, we should go to the sauna party
and hear what Samy's got to say.

1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:15.375
I'd like to know that too.
-I thought we're going to the girls?

1:02:15.541 --> 1:02:18.041
Ok, you go to the girls.
We'll look for Samy.

1:02:18.208 --> 1:02:19.208
Dude!

1:02:25.166 --> 1:02:26.125
Come on, Carmen!

1:02:28.250 --> 1:02:29.375
Got it?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:02:36.333 --> 1:02:37.458
We made it!

1:02:40.708 --> 1:02:41.833
Fuck!

1:02:43.250 --> 1:02:45.166
Damn it, Julia!

1:02:45.833 --> 1:02:47.125
Stop!

1:02:53.625 --> 1:02:55.208
You can't get in. We're full.

1:02:55.416 --> 1:02:57.708
We're just looking for a friend.
He's in there somewhere.

1:02:58.041 --> 1:02:59.166
Calm down!

1:02:59.333 --> 1:03:00.708
Looking for trouble?

1:03:00.958 --> 1:03:04.833
Our friend isn't feeling well.
We'll only be in there for a second.

1:03:21.333 --> 1:03:22.833
Hey, there's Leo!

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:29.291
Leo! Cheesy is innocent, it was Samy!
You have to shut down the party!

1:03:29.625 --> 1:03:33.958
Hey Julia, where's Lexi?
Where did she go?

1:03:36.666 --> 1:03:40.250
It's important that you stay calm, ok?
Everyone has to go back to their rooms,

1:03:40.416 --> 1:03:42.916
so we know what's going on.
-I can't go back to my room.

1:03:43.083 --> 1:03:44.416
Samy can find me there.

1:03:47.916 --> 1:03:48.958
Come with me.

1:04:00.291 --> 1:04:02.416
Are you ok?
-I went to your room to look for you.

1:04:02.750 --> 1:04:04.208
Samy is after us.
We climbed down the balcony.

1:04:04.958 --> 1:04:08.125
Let's go to the police and tell them.
-Bogi, we don't have any proof.

1:04:08.458 --> 1:04:11.625
And by the time they get here...
-Guys, let's look for the others at least!

1:04:11.958 --> 1:04:15.166
Jakob and Andi are at the sauna party.
Let's go find them!

1:04:16.125 --> 1:04:19.958
I'll be back as soon as
I tell the police about Samy.

1:04:21.041 --> 1:04:24.333
Don't leave my room
and don't open the door for anyone, ok?

1:04:42.541 --> 1:04:44.291
Look, it's Samy!

1:06:03.875 --> 1:06:06.500
"I think they are slowly starting
to accept me.

1:06:06.666 --> 1:06:09.000
Jakob even smiled at me today.

1:06:10.791 --> 1:06:13.541
That night I finally felt like
I was part of the group.

1:06:14.875 --> 1:06:16.541
I was pretty nervous.

1:06:19.208 --> 1:06:20.583
Truth or dare...

1:06:21.166 --> 1:06:23.500
I didn't dare to pick truth...
The t-shirt smelled strange...

1:06:23.666 --> 1:06:25.583
They would've asked me
who I have a crush on...

1:06:25.833 --> 1:06:27.916
I didn't even want to be there...
I couldn't see, couldn't breathe...

1:06:28.083 --> 1:06:28.916
... but Julia said 'Fuck it!'

1:06:29.083 --> 1:06:30.333
I didn't want to spoil the fun...

1:06:30.666 --> 1:06:32.333
It felt great at first...
I really hoped it was Jakob...

1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:34.208
I can't look them in the eye anymore...
Then he laughed...

1:06:34.375 --> 1:06:36.333
It wasn't Jakob...
I wanted to leave, but they didn't let me...

1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:39.000
I could see the streetlamp
through a gap in the curtains.

1:06:39.166 --> 1:06:42.166
The others didn't give a fuck about me...
They didn't notice.

1:06:45.083 --> 1:06:48.333
How could I have told them?
For them it was all just fun and games.

1:06:50.333 --> 1:06:52.750
I can't get his words out of my head:

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.833
'Get over it, now it's already inside!'

1:07:27.875 --> 1:07:29.416
Lexi... just wait!

1:07:51.583 --> 1:07:53.833
Where did Carmen go?
-I don't know!

1:08:25.833 --> 1:08:27.500
What's she doing?

1:09:17.458 --> 1:09:19.166
Shit, Bogi... it was Lexi!

1:09:19.958 --> 1:09:21.791
Keep moving!
-All that blood...

1:09:27.375 --> 1:09:28.541
Faster!

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.958
Where are you guys going?
-He wants to kill all of us.

1:09:33.125 --> 1:09:35.250
I heard that somebody died.
Do you know who?

1:09:35.416 --> 1:09:38.416
It was Lexi.
Everything was full of blood.

1:09:38.625 --> 1:09:40.333
We have to go, Leo.
He'll kill everyone.

1:09:40.666 --> 1:09:42.208
Where?
-No idea... just away from here.

1:09:42.416 --> 1:09:45.666
Ok, wait. I have a pickup truck.
I can take you to the ferry port.

1:09:45.833 --> 1:09:47.166
This way. Come on.

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:49.291
Come on!
-We have to find the others first.

1:09:49.625 --> 1:09:53.250
Do you really want to wait for
the whole class right now? Come on, please!

1:09:53.583 --> 1:09:55.666
Julia, come on! Come!

1:10:01.416 --> 1:10:03.583
Get in the front seat.
Julia, come on.

1:10:13.625 --> 1:10:15.375
Julia, wait!

1:10:16.416 --> 1:10:18.750
Bogi! Fuck!

1:10:31.750 --> 1:10:34.250
I should've watched out for Lexi.

1:10:35.333 --> 1:10:37.083
What could you have done?

1:10:37.625 --> 1:10:38.750
Drink something.

1:10:51.416 --> 1:10:52.625
No, thanks.

1:11:11.875 --> 1:11:14.375
And you really don't know
who's after you?

1:11:17.541 --> 1:11:20.250
Bogi found videos from Samy,

1:11:21.333 --> 1:11:23.333
and Samy wanted to get into our room.

1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:28.375
We climbed out the balcony
to get away,

1:11:28.541 --> 1:11:30.708
because Samy was trying to get in.

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.916
That was very strange,
because Lexi, Carmen and I...

1:11:41.333 --> 1:11:43.416
What's wrong, Julia?

1:11:47.708 --> 1:11:49.416
What's going on, Leo?
-It will be fine.

1:11:49.583 --> 1:11:51.166
Where are we going?

1:11:52.750 --> 1:11:54.500
Where are we going...
Leo...

1:12:02.375 --> 1:12:03.708
Leo, what's going on?

1:12:04.083 --> 1:12:06.250
Go to sleep, Bogi.
Lie down, come on.

1:12:37.375 --> 1:12:39.708
I'm sorry about Lexi, ok?

1:12:40.041 --> 1:12:42.250
She shouldn't have gone through my stuff.

1:12:46.875 --> 1:12:50.458
It's a pity we can't do this
with the original cast.

1:12:51.458 --> 1:12:53.375
We'll just have to improvise.

1:12:53.791 --> 1:12:55.458
Tell us what you want, wanker!

1:13:11.083 --> 1:13:12.875
Truth or dare?

1:13:13.333 --> 1:13:14.333
Dare.

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.083
Finally, here we go!

1:13:18.458 --> 1:13:23.000
Ok, go to the storage room, blindfolded,

1:13:23.166 --> 1:13:26.333
and someone will follow you,
and you have to guess who it is.

1:13:27.291 --> 1:13:28.291
Oh, God.

1:13:29.333 --> 1:13:30.833
Are you ready?

1:13:31.458 --> 1:13:32.625
Yes.

1:13:34.250 --> 1:13:37.458
Careful.
-Wow, that looks cool.

1:13:40.708 --> 1:13:41.833
Is it ok?
Wait a second.

1:13:53.625 --> 1:13:54.625
Pay attention.

1:13:55.041 --> 1:13:56.250
Walk straight ahead.

1:13:57.500 --> 1:13:59.041
Have fun, Anna!

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.666
Go in there!
-No, come on!

1:14:08.875 --> 1:14:10.458
Fine...

1:14:13.250 --> 1:14:14.666
Are you coming, too?
-Me?

1:14:14.875 --> 1:14:17.291
Of course you.
-Have fun!

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.166
Shut the door!

1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:27.625
Who are you?

1:14:27.791 --> 1:14:28.833
Leo Thalhammer.

1:14:29.166 --> 1:14:32.375
You're Anna's brother!
-Yes, Julia. I am.

1:14:33.333 --> 1:14:36.166
Ok, you know the rules.
We'll play a round.

1:14:39.541 --> 1:14:40.875
Truth or dare?

1:14:44.208 --> 1:14:45.208
Truth.

1:14:52.041 --> 1:14:54.041
Are you in love with Julia?
-What?

1:14:54.875 --> 1:14:56.375
Well, are you in love with her?

1:14:56.708 --> 1:14:58.416
Just say yes or no!

1:15:01.375 --> 1:15:03.000
No.

1:15:03.375 --> 1:15:04.375
A pity.

1:15:09.333 --> 1:15:11.000
There's only one problem.

1:15:16.208 --> 1:15:18.333
You're not allowed to lie in this game.

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:21.458
Stop it! Don't do it!

1:15:21.791 --> 1:15:23.208
Stop!

1:15:23.458 --> 1:15:26.875
Hold this until she stops moving,
or I'll kill you.

1:15:27.041 --> 1:15:28.041
No! No!

1:15:28.208 --> 1:15:29.541
Fucking hell, hold it tight!
-I can't.

1:15:29.708 --> 1:15:31.708
Tighten it!
-No!

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000
No, no, no.
Leave him alone!

1:15:40.541 --> 1:15:42.791
I thought you aren't in love with her?

1:15:46.958 --> 1:15:49.000
Shit, shit!

1:15:53.458 --> 1:15:54.916
Don't touch me!

1:15:58.541 --> 1:16:00.250
Stay there!

1:16:07.625 --> 1:16:09.291
I'm sorry for what I did.

1:16:09.541 --> 1:16:10.916
Just shut your mouth.

1:16:12.291 --> 1:16:14.041
We're far from done here.

1:16:23.291 --> 1:16:25.875
It's your turn. Julia. Truth or dare?

1:16:27.916 --> 1:16:29.583
Bogi! Say something!
-Calm down, Julia.

1:16:30.166 --> 1:16:31.250
Come now.

1:16:31.583 --> 1:16:32.583
What did you do to him?

1:16:32.833 --> 1:16:33.875
It's your turn.

1:16:36.416 --> 1:16:37.416
Truth or dare?

1:16:40.416 --> 1:16:42.666
Fine... we'll finish this round of truth.

1:16:45.833 --> 1:16:48.708
Did you ever think about Anna
after she left your school?

1:16:50.125 --> 1:16:52.541
What happened to her, maybe?

1:16:55.916 --> 1:16:59.125
Did you know that it was the first time

1:16:59.291 --> 1:17:02.958
in her life
that she felt comfortable in a class?

1:17:04.875 --> 1:17:07.625
She would have been happy
to come with you on this trip.

1:17:09.833 --> 1:17:12.500
Have an amazing time
with all of you one more time, right?

1:17:12.666 --> 1:17:14.916
The best party of your life!

1:17:20.791 --> 1:17:22.791
Andi, time for a dare.
Come on!

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:25.250
Get up.

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:29.166
How much did you drink
before you raped my little sister?

1:17:29.333 --> 1:17:32.416
It was Jakob's idea!
-That's not true! You started kissing her.

1:17:32.583 --> 1:17:34.125
I was just holding the camera.

1:17:34.291 --> 1:17:35.666
It's not your turn!

1:17:35.833 --> 1:17:39.041
You wanker told me to bang her.
It was your fucking idea!

1:17:43.416 --> 1:17:44.916
Little wanker.
-No, no, no.

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:48.166
Come on, show us your pretty ass.

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:53.333
No, please leave me alone. Stop it!

1:17:53.583 --> 1:17:55.416
Andi, come on.
-No, I'm sorry.

1:17:56.083 --> 1:17:57.708
Just take the bottle.

1:17:58.833 --> 1:18:00.250
No!
-Yes!

1:18:00.416 --> 1:18:02.750
Andi, don't do it!
-Yes, do it. Come on.

1:18:02.916 --> 1:18:04.500
You saw what happened to Bogi.

1:18:08.125 --> 1:18:10.791
Get over it,
now it's already inside.

1:18:13.666 --> 1:18:15.541
Now it's your turn, buddy.

1:18:15.875 --> 1:18:17.041
Come on.

1:18:21.875 --> 1:18:23.166
The bottle,

1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:24.458
come on.

1:18:25.041 --> 1:18:26.583
Put it in there.

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:30.625
Harder! Stay in there!

1:18:39.291 --> 1:18:40.416
Very good.

1:19:25.041 --> 1:19:26.041
Dare, Julia.

1:19:27.833 --> 1:19:30.208
Now you can make up for
what you did to Anna.

1:19:31.791 --> 1:19:33.416
Wait, I'll help you.

1:19:33.583 --> 1:19:35.375
I'll help you.

1:19:35.958 --> 1:19:37.208
Stop it.

1:19:38.458 --> 1:19:39.541
Let me go!

1:19:39.708 --> 1:19:42.041
Let me go!
I didn't do anything to her!

1:19:42.208 --> 1:19:44.583
Stop it!
-I didn't do anything to her!

1:19:44.791 --> 1:19:46.708
You guys killed my little sister!

1:19:47.041 --> 1:19:48.625
She went to our school
for three months.

1:19:48.791 --> 1:19:51.416
I never even talked to her.
How should I have known that...

1:19:51.583 --> 1:19:54.000
... that they would rape her?

1:19:54.333 --> 1:19:55.458
Say it!

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:59.291
Of course you knew what was going on.
You were in the next room.

1:19:59.458 --> 1:20:01.083
Don't bullshit me!

1:20:02.916 --> 1:20:06.041
You just ignored it.
You didn't give a fuck about her.

1:20:06.208 --> 1:20:07.625
What are you guys doing?

1:20:10.125 --> 1:20:13.041
Where did you guys leave Anna?
-I think she's sleeping.

1:20:13.208 --> 1:20:14.791
Let's take a selfie!

1:20:19.875 --> 1:20:21.333
Come on, Anna!

1:20:21.500 --> 1:20:23.000
Quiet, or he'll wake up.

1:20:24.583 --> 1:20:25.916
Wait, something's missing...

1:20:28.666 --> 1:20:30.833
The party was more important to you guys.

1:20:33.666 --> 1:20:34.916
But now it's your dare, Julia.

1:20:36.125 --> 1:20:37.041
What?

1:20:38.083 --> 1:20:40.125
Bury these two and I'll let you go.

1:20:40.833 --> 1:20:41.833
Come on, Julia.

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.000
You can do it.

1:20:45.791 --> 1:20:46.791
You can do it!

1:20:50.333 --> 1:20:51.333
What?

1:21:03.208 --> 1:21:05.583
I have to do everything myself.

1:21:10.125 --> 1:21:16.166
Can you imagine what it's like to find
your own sister with her wrists slit open?

1:21:19.333 --> 1:21:22.291
I didn't get it for a long time,
until I found her diary.

1:23:11.583 --> 1:23:13.416
Bogi. can you hear me?

1:23:13.583 --> 1:23:14.916
What are you doing with Bogi?

1:23:18.750 --> 1:23:21.416
Shit.
-Careful, Julia. He's a psycho, too!

1:23:21.958 --> 1:23:23.583
What's going on with you and Leo?

1:23:24.666 --> 1:23:26.208
Nothing!

1:23:26.541 --> 1:23:28.375
Bullshit! He's lying, Julia!

1:23:28.541 --> 1:23:30.208
He's lying.

1:23:30.416 --> 1:23:33.791
He just asked me not to tell you
about Anna's death, ok?

1:23:34.125 --> 1:23:36.250
He wanted to know things about the class.

1:23:38.583 --> 1:23:40.791
Give me your hand.
I'll pull you up.

1:23:40.958 --> 1:23:42.416
We have to get Bogi out of here.

1:23:44.166 --> 1:23:45.166
Come on!

1:23:52.666 --> 1:23:53.791
Come on!

1:23:54.750 --> 1:23:55.750
I got you.

1:24:04.375 --> 1:24:08.083
Julia, please help us get out of here.

1:24:09.208 --> 1:24:11.000
Please, Julia!

1:24:11.791 --> 1:24:14.666
Get out of there yourselves, you pigs!

1:24:19.916 --> 1:24:21.500
We have to help him!

1:24:21.916 --> 1:24:23.250
Careful.

1:24:32.041 --> 1:24:34.458
X-Jam, X-Jam, X-Jam!

1:25:07.583 --> 1:25:09.541
I met some crazy dudes.

1:25:09.875 --> 1:25:13.666
I'm telling you,
a night in jail changes you forever.

1:25:14.375 --> 1:25:15.875
Poor you!

1:25:16.458 --> 1:25:17.833
Can we take a selfie?

1:25:24.291 --> 1:25:25.708
Hey Bogi!
-Hi guys!

1:25:25.916 --> 1:25:27.083
Careful with his shoulder.

1:25:27.250 --> 1:25:29.041
How are you feeling?
-I'm fine.

1:25:29.333 --> 1:25:31.375
Are you in pain?
-I'm alright.

1:25:31.708 --> 1:25:33.708
Careful with his shoulder.
He's still recovering.

1:25:37.333 --> 1:25:41.083
I'm sorry. We're still looking for Luki,
but...

1:25:42.583 --> 1:25:43.583
Well...

1:25:44.541 --> 1:25:47.166
Have a good trip home.
-Thanks!

1:25:47.333 --> 1:25:48.666
Bye!

1:25:49.416 --> 1:25:53.458
What happened to those guys?
This is going to be the biggest party ever.

1:25:53.791 --> 1:25:56.333
A week from now we'll look the same.

1:25:59.375 --> 1:26:01.541
Well, here we are.

1:26:02.416 --> 1:26:05.333
And I thought this would be my week.
-Why?

1:26:05.666 --> 1:26:07.416
I was planning to come out.

1:26:08.708 --> 1:26:11.291
Sorry, but everyone knew.

1:26:11.625 --> 1:26:13.666
What?
-Everyone.

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:15.916
We've known each other long enough.

1:26:16.750 --> 1:26:18.750
That doesn't say much.

1:26:19.666 --> 1:26:21.000
You're right.

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.958
Let's go, guys.
