<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

00:15.861 --> 00:18.617
<i>Hello. This is Centurion Trust.</i>

00:18.697 --> 00:22.805
<i>We have a robbery in progress
at 23 Forsythe Place.</i>

00:22.885 --> 00:25.081
<i>So it's in progress right now?</i>

00:25.171 --> 00:29.062
<i>They're in the building. They're taking
hostages, so as soon as you can.</i>

00:29.142 --> 00:31.231
<i>Sir, are you in a safe place?</i>

00:31.711 --> 00:33.565
<i>Drop the phone.</i>

00:33.945 --> 00:35.501
<i>Sir?</i>

00:35.981 --> 00:37.548
<i>Hello?</i>

05:36.548 --> 05:39.351
All right, you're all set. Thank you.

06:19.423 --> 06:21.259
I hate sirens.

06:22.628 --> 06:25.629
You never know if it's your
own damn house on fire.

06:30.435 --> 06:32.236
Miss Reece?

06:36.040 --> 06:38.676
I'm Chris Kirkham. Come on in.

06:43.364 --> 06:44.893
Hi.

06:45.269 --> 06:47.350
What can I do for you today?

06:48.540 --> 06:51.011
I got another deposit for ya.

06:51.391 --> 06:52.751
Okay.

06:53.259 --> 06:55.915
Thanks for waiting out there.
I appreciate your patience.

06:55.995 --> 07:00.286
We're just crazy after the holiday weekend.
It gets to be a bit of a circus around here.

07:01.166 --> 07:04.235
- My resume.
- Great, thanks. You can take a seat.

07:09.841 --> 07:12.076
All right, let's see what we got here.

07:15.297 --> 07:16.840
And is that all?

07:18.050 --> 07:19.787
Got any marshmallows?

07:20.887 --> 07:23.810
I'm sorry, marshmallows?

07:24.790 --> 07:28.281
Yeah, there's a fire.
We can just skip the marshmallows.

07:28.361 --> 07:32.252
Maybe you might want to meet me
for happy hour when you close?

07:32.932 --> 07:35.189
You are too sweet.

07:36.069 --> 07:40.293
Sounds like somebody got started
a little bit early already on happy hour.

07:41.173 --> 07:43.264
I like to beat the crowds.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.832
All righty, you are all set.

07:46.912 --> 07:48.739
Have yourself a nice day.

07:54.085 --> 07:58.003
Babe, just because it happened once,
doesn't mean every time I meet a woman...

07:58.083 --> 08:00.794
- ...it's gonna happen again at the bar.
- Sorry, next window.

08:00.874 --> 08:04.717
- How may I help you today, ma'am?
- You may help me today.

08:05.297 --> 08:07.320
These bounced.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.490
Insufficient funds.

08:10.570 --> 08:14.795
That's quite impossible. I made
a big deposit yesterday, so fix it.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.898
- Let me see what I can do.
- Yeah, you do that.

08:19.878 --> 08:22.914
You sure you want to brave it
out there, Detective?

08:25.383 --> 08:28.435
Hey, it looks like it's getting kind
of serious out there, you might...

08:28.515 --> 08:30.554
...make sure everybody gets out okay.

08:36.561 --> 08:39.885
Looks like you've worked with some
of the big guys. That's great.

08:39.965 --> 08:41.799
You probably know the drill.

08:44.636 --> 08:49.263
Okay, so a little bit of time
since your last position.

08:50.443 --> 08:52.276
What did you get up to there?

08:54.379 --> 08:56.069
I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?

08:56.149 --> 08:59.072
Just a little bit of time
between your last position...

08:59.152 --> 09:02.875
...what did you get up to there?
What happened?

09:02.955 --> 09:04.844
I traveled.

09:05.224 --> 09:09.414
I spent some time in Mexico with
my church group teaching English...

09:09.494 --> 09:13.686
...and fell so in love with it that I ended
up just staying there for about a year.

09:13.766 --> 09:15.922
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah. It's great.

09:16.002 --> 09:19.615
The only reason I came back was because
someone in my family got really sick...

09:19.695 --> 09:23.796
...so I'm looking for a job
to start as soon as possible.

09:23.876 --> 09:27.167
Fair enough. Okay, gotcha.
I hope they're okay.

09:27.847 --> 09:30.068
Okay, great, well, listen...

09:30.952 --> 09:33.673
...this checks out, we do a background check.

09:33.753 --> 09:35.675
It's just a formality,
but they're pretty thorough.

09:35.755 --> 09:38.478
- You expect any red flags there? Any issues?
- No.

09:38.558 --> 09:43.182
So what happens is, you guys charge a fucking
fee for every single check that I bounced.

09:43.262 --> 09:46.285
I get charged. Okay?

09:46.365 --> 09:48.570
So then what happens is...
hold on. Let me talk.

09:48.650 --> 09:53.995
What happens is I get charged a fee for
every fucking check here that bounced...

09:54.075 --> 09:57.408
...then the people that I paid,
they charge me...

09:57.488 --> 10:00.233
...and the fucking circus
happens all over again.

10:00.313 --> 10:03.030
- Yes, ma'am. I understand.
- I really don't think you do understand...

10:03.110 --> 10:05.671
...because now that my account's
in the red, what?

10:05.751 --> 10:09.542
You're going to charge me another penalty?
Yeah, that's what you guys fucking do.

10:09.622 --> 10:11.844
- So let me ask you something.
- Okay.

10:11.924 --> 10:14.957
When the bank fucks up,
who pays Redd's penalties?

10:15.037 --> 10:19.686
- Ma'am, if you would watch your language...
- You charge me for every goddamn mistake.

10:19.766 --> 10:22.688
How does anybody get ahead in fucking life?
You know what I mean?

10:22.768 --> 10:25.959
- Let me ask you a fucking question, Mary.
- Yes?

10:26.239 --> 10:29.040
Who pays when you make a fucking mistake?

11:00.238 --> 11:03.774
- How'd the marshmallow line work for you?
- Fuck you.

11:10.381 --> 11:12.839
Well, listen, that leaves just timing.

11:13.319 --> 11:16.598
What's your timeline like?
The truth is we have...

11:17.350 --> 11:21.747
...three tellers spots open now.
I can't seem to keep them, so...

11:21.827 --> 11:23.608
Can I ask why?

11:24.730 --> 11:28.087
- If you don't mind me asking.
- No, I understand.

11:28.668 --> 11:30.536
I still want the job.

11:31.537 --> 11:35.029
I mean, it's silly, but since you asked...

11:35.109 --> 11:38.323
...it's an old building and...

11:39.103 --> 11:42.023
...some people get spooked
in here, and they...

11:42.103 --> 11:44.304
...think they hear and see things.

11:44.884 --> 11:47.680
And so, I swear to God, it's just...

11:47.760 --> 11:49.571
...people talking and getting in their head.

11:49.651 --> 11:52.145
- Please? Curb your language.
- Yes. Please. Excuse me.

11:52.225 --> 11:55.326
- If you'll give me your social security...
- Hold on. Hold on.

11:56.996 --> 11:59.018
- Let me talk to a manager.
- Absolutely.

11:59.098 --> 12:01.420
Let's do that. Let's get
a fucking manager around here.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.607
There's a fucking manager here.
There's gotta be some fucking manager here.

12:04.687 --> 12:06.842
Okay. What seems to be the issue?

12:06.972 --> 12:09.262
She had these checks returned.
I've looked her up.

12:09.342 --> 12:12.245
Are you the manager
or just a financial service specialist?

12:12.325 --> 12:16.502
I am Susan, the head teller,
and I'm just trying to see...

12:16.582 --> 12:19.071
- ...if I can help you here, okay?
- The head teller?

12:19.151 --> 12:21.647
Oh, great, here comes the cavalry.

12:21.887 --> 12:24.150
I can't explain it, but...

12:25.804 --> 12:29.800
...in fairness, it's probably worth
telling you that in advance, but...

12:29.880 --> 12:31.882
...I don't make anything of it.

12:32.832 --> 12:35.770
You know, do you spook easily, Miss Reece?

12:35.850 --> 12:39.107
- No, sir. Not me.
- Okay, good. That settles that.

12:39.187 --> 12:41.651
The only thing that spooks is a bad loan.

12:43.725 --> 12:46.015
- That's funny.
- I'm perfectly calm.

12:46.145 --> 12:49.368
- So you checked the record?
- I just want my fucking money.

12:49.448 --> 12:53.189
Okay, ma'am, you don't have
an account with us.

12:54.419 --> 12:57.943
Well, that's a fucking mistake. Check again.

12:58.023 --> 13:01.214
- Is there a problem?
- No. There's no problem at all actually.

13:01.294 --> 13:05.897
- Hey, your shitty life is not my problem.
- Sir, can you let us handle this, sir?

13:13.903 --> 13:16.173
I'm gonna need you to step outside.

13:27.318 --> 13:30.843
Where's the fire? Is it close? Are we safe?

13:30.923 --> 13:33.346
We just need everybody to stay inside.

13:34.226 --> 13:37.283
- Ma'am, please.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't touch me.

13:37.363 --> 13:40.319
Get her the fuck out of here.
Please, do something about this.

13:40.399 --> 13:44.401
- Keep your hands off me.
- I need you to step outside with me.

13:53.644 --> 13:55.702
Hands behind your head.

13:56.682 --> 14:01.447
Unit 4919, I'm at Centurion Trust Bank.
23 Forsythe Street. I've got a 29 in progress.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.596
Get down.

14:21.205 --> 14:22.765
Fuck that.

14:23.175 --> 14:25.397
Back up, now!

14:25.477 --> 14:28.545
Yeah, that's right. Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.

14:42.293 --> 14:45.186
Eyes to me. Back, back, back, back.

14:45.266 --> 14:47.100
Back up!

14:47.466 --> 14:49.724
Keep your eyes on me at all times.

14:51.270 --> 14:54.676
<i>Unit 4919, is the situation under control?</i>

14:55.841 --> 14:58.674
You say code 21, this ends bad for everybody.

15:04.382 --> 15:06.272
Situation under control.

15:07.619 --> 15:11.275
- Good work.
- <i>Unit 4919, please repeat.</i>

15:17.496 --> 15:20.965
Yes, this is 4919.

15:21.467 --> 15:25.331
Situation under control. Took care of it.

15:31.008 --> 15:34.077
Let's check it out real quick.
I'll be right back.

15:41.219 --> 15:46.278
<i>This is Centurion Trust, we have
a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

15:46.358 --> 15:48.647
<i>Could you please send the police.</i>

15:48.827 --> 15:50.716
<i>In progress right now.</i>

15:50.796 --> 15:54.087
<i>They're taking hostages,
so as soon as you can.</i>

15:55.547 --> 15:58.091
Out now. Safety deposit vault. Let's go.

15:58.171 --> 16:01.072
You want to survive today?
Let's go. Let's go.

16:06.544 --> 16:08.776
Are you sure you want to do this, honey?

16:10.415 --> 16:14.139
Okay, I did a background
check too, Mr. Kirkham.

16:14.219 --> 16:16.108
You live in a nice house
with a white picket fence,

16:16.188 --> 16:18.644
you've got two boys, 7 and 8,
and another on the way.

16:18.724 --> 16:21.125
You make a decent amount of money,
and you've got a pretty enough wife...

16:21.205 --> 16:24.103
- ...so you have no reason to play hero.
- Okay.

16:24.463 --> 16:26.982
- I need you to work with me. Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

16:27.062 --> 16:29.702
- All right?
- Okay, understood.

16:30.602 --> 16:34.026
What are you doing? What are you doing?

16:34.106 --> 16:36.982
- We said don't hurt anybody.
- You fucking hurt somebody.

16:37.062 --> 16:40.283
- I did it to save you.
- I know, thanks. Awesome.

16:41.013 --> 16:44.770
- Using fucking brass knuckles like that.
- I don't have time to be a good person.

16:44.850 --> 16:47.686
- We're either doing this or we're not. Chill.
- We just don't hurt anybody, okay?

16:47.766 --> 16:50.761
- Well...
- That's what... that's what we agreed.

16:51.389 --> 16:53.880
- All right?
- All right. Fine.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.078
Fine.

16:56.328 --> 16:59.101
- I need you to tell them to remain calm.
- Understood.

16:59.181 --> 17:02.721
You remain calm,
the orders are clear, do nothing.

17:02.801 --> 17:05.324
Sit quietly. Say your prayers in your head.

17:05.404 --> 17:08.992
- Do you understand? Okay? Thank you.
- Understood. Okay.

17:18.883 --> 17:22.107
- Sir, please.
- Don't talk. Do it.

17:22.186 --> 17:24.255
It's gonna be okay, Mary.

17:30.261 --> 17:32.283
Good girl. Come on.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.794
Come on, let's go. Come on.

17:39.121 --> 17:41.168
Come on. Come on.

17:53.451 --> 17:55.719
You want me to do this or not?

17:59.923 --> 18:02.548
You're okay. Don't be nervous.

18:02.928 --> 18:06.369
Why so nervous? Why so nervous?

18:06.532 --> 18:09.439
Good girl. Good girls.

18:19.178 --> 18:20.244
Stop.

18:31.589 --> 18:33.258
Just stop.

18:33.338 --> 18:36.383
Get the code. You're doing very well.

18:38.563 --> 18:41.829
Now, stop being so self indulgent,
or I kill the cop.

18:48.372 --> 18:52.643
Sir, stay still. Stay still.
Stay still. Fuck.

19:27.744 --> 19:30.169
Goddammit. Do it right.

19:30.249 --> 19:33.238
Okay. Okay. Okay.

19:33.618 --> 19:35.907
What is so fucking difficult?

19:35.987 --> 19:38.388
Come on. Come on. Come on.

19:43.560 --> 19:47.753
Where the fuck is the rest of the money?
Are you telling me there's all there is?

19:47.833 --> 19:50.067
You're fucking useless.

19:58.575 --> 20:01.010
- You got it?
- Come on, let's go!

20:02.531 --> 20:05.814
- How much?
- Maybe a little over $70,000.

20:06.919 --> 20:09.541
I mean, there might be $5,000
or $10,000 in the teller's station.

20:09.621 --> 20:12.999
- How much? What'd he say?
- 70 grand.

20:13.826 --> 20:15.414
Clear.

20:15.494 --> 20:19.117
All right, that's not enough. Let's go.
Come on, Vee, let's get out of here.

20:19.197 --> 20:22.420
What do you mean? Are you fucking kidding?

20:22.500 --> 20:26.558
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- What? Let's go? Fucking leave?

20:26.638 --> 20:29.994
We're not gonna leave.
You're not fucking going anywhere.

20:30.074 --> 20:33.606
Come on, we came here for him.
We came here to do this for him...

20:33.686 --> 20:36.441
...and we're not leaving until we do it.
Do you understand that?

20:36.521 --> 20:38.471
- Yes, I understand.
- Okay, then what's the problem?

20:38.551 --> 20:42.425
Does that look like half a million
dollars to you? No. 70 grand.

20:42.505 --> 20:45.410
Should we just go and rob some more fucking
banks or should we just finish this out?

20:45.490 --> 20:48.847
- We leave while we still can.
- We're not leaving and going anywhere.

20:49.927 --> 20:52.176
Let go. Let go.

20:52.256 --> 20:54.498
Look at me. Look at me.
Let's get out of here, okay?

20:55.733 --> 20:59.625
Don't worry, I want to kill you too, bitch.
You've always been a fucking bitch.

20:59.705 --> 21:02.265
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

21:03.375 --> 21:05.962
Let's go. All that we planned out.

21:09.580 --> 21:10.869
Drop your fucking gun.

21:10.949 --> 21:14.506
I've got brothers I've got to answer to.
We ain't going anywhere without the money.

21:14.586 --> 21:17.074
You put your gun down, motherfucker.

21:18.857 --> 21:21.313
Please, please, please.

21:21.393 --> 21:24.606
Please, can we not leave without the money?
I hate when you get stubborn like this.

21:24.686 --> 21:27.552
Leah, this isn't a military op, okay?

21:27.632 --> 21:30.845
- We're not leaving without the money.
- Vee, Vee, look at me. There's no money.

21:30.925 --> 21:34.093
- It's a fucking bank. There's always money.
- Then where's the money?

21:34.173 --> 21:36.861
If you know where the money is,
show me where the money is.

21:36.941 --> 21:39.342
Look, I can tell you where the money is.

21:51.822 --> 21:55.480
- I can help you.
- Who the fuck are you?

21:55.560 --> 21:59.918
I'm the assistant manager.
I know this bank inside and out.

21:59.998 --> 22:03.055
First, you're going to
want to disable the alarm.

22:03.835 --> 22:07.327
- What alarm?
- Behind the tellers' windows.

22:08.907 --> 22:12.475
It was set off because you
didn't follow protocol.

22:15.412 --> 22:17.837
You have three minutes, maybe four.

22:19.037 --> 22:22.941
- Then what? What happens?
- Till the police know that you're here.

22:23.021 --> 22:24.580
- Can you please take this bag off.
- No.

22:24.660 --> 22:28.246
- I'm having trouble. I have asthma.
- It doesn't matter. Tell me more.

22:28.326 --> 22:33.327
Look, at 5:20, all transactions
need to be reconciled...

22:33.407 --> 22:35.654
...and synced with the database.

22:35.734 --> 22:38.376
We need to verify the cash...

22:38.456 --> 22:41.326
...lock all the drawers in the safe
and the manager needs to type his pin in.

22:41.406 --> 22:45.305
If that doesn't happen,
the alarm is triggered at exactly 5:20.

22:47.144 --> 22:51.414
Now, the manager can do it or me.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.110
Take the bag off.

22:58.290 --> 22:59.799
Who the fuck are you?

23:01.459 --> 23:04.214
I can... I can help you.

23:06.897 --> 23:11.301
You just have to promise me
that no one else is going to get hurt.

23:15.372 --> 23:17.595
No, you listen to me, all right?

23:18.145 --> 23:22.622
You do as we say, we won't hurt you
and that's it. There's no negotiating here.

23:23.781 --> 23:28.818
The signal is sent, the police come.
It's as simple as that. No one wins.

23:32.455 --> 23:35.090
- That's true.
- Hold on.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.852
All right, no one's going to get hurt, okay?

23:39.932 --> 23:42.571
Get the pin. Let's do this.

23:43.701 --> 23:45.160
Leah.

24:19.236 --> 24:22.495
- So we good?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

24:24.175 --> 24:26.498
Where's the rest of the money?

24:26.578 --> 24:30.819
It's down below. That's where... that's
where the real money is, in the old vault.

24:30.899 --> 24:33.389
- You can get in there?
- It's a private vault.

24:33.469 --> 24:37.209
It's part of the old bank.
We just house it. It's antiquated.

24:37.289 --> 24:39.184
It's not even on the grid.

24:39.264 --> 24:42.114
- We're not prepared for this.
- We're in pretty good shape, I gotta say.

24:42.194 --> 24:44.985
We got the cobalt drill bits,
we got the welder for the back way out.

24:45.065 --> 24:49.321
- Perfect. Then we're going in.
- Depends on the vault. How old?

24:50.101 --> 24:52.590
It's 60, 70 years.

24:52.670 --> 24:54.726
- We don't have time.
- Bullshit.

24:54.806 --> 24:59.731
The whole fucking warehouse is up in flames,
everything is locked up, we got time.

24:59.811 --> 25:01.833
How much money's in it?

25:01.913 --> 25:03.869
$6 million, cash.

25:04.149 --> 25:07.396
- $6 million?
- Bullshit.

25:08.586 --> 25:13.645
No, it's there. The end of
the basement hall, there's a door.

25:14.125 --> 25:17.036
The key is... here, this is it.

25:18.596 --> 25:20.419
The key.

25:20.799 --> 25:22.688
We're in.

25:23.208 --> 25:27.125
<i>The fire we set is going to keep those
cops busy. I'll go down with Kramer.</i>

25:27.205 --> 25:31.596
<i>I'm gonna check it out and make sure
we're good. I'll be back in five minutes.</i>

25:31.676 --> 25:34.766
<i>Time me. You stay up here,
and you keep a lookout...</i>

25:34.846 --> 25:38.002
<i>...and then Michael goes down next
to cut the hole in the water main.</i>

25:38.082 --> 25:40.572
They're not on to us.
Haven't heard anything. We're good.

25:40.652 --> 25:43.575
<i>Supervise the whole operation
from up on high.</i>

25:43.655 --> 25:48.379
<i>Please watch Mr. assistant bank manager,
make sure Cyrus doesn't fucking kill anybody.</i>

25:48.459 --> 25:53.204
<i>In 30 minutes, we will slip out
the back door with $6 million cash.</i>

25:53.284 --> 25:55.548
<i>It's fucking perfect.</i>

27:06.069 --> 27:10.273
<i>Vee, if you can hear me, look at
the cameras behind you. 4 o'clock.</i>

27:19.116 --> 27:20.996
All right.

27:22.953 --> 27:25.621
- Let's go.
- Yeah, right.

27:31.662 --> 27:34.183
I can tell you're a decent man.

27:35.099 --> 27:36.911
You don't know me.

27:38.302 --> 27:39.858
Please, sir.

27:39.938 --> 27:42.593
- Stop talking.
- Please?

27:42.673 --> 27:45.029
- Shut up, let me handle this.
- Sir, stop talking.

27:45.109 --> 27:49.199
If you would've done your job from the
beginning, we wouldn't be in this shit show.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.536
- Yeah, come on, buddy, let us go.
- Sir, let me handle this.

27:51.616 --> 27:53.538
Let me negotiate.
You had a chance to handle this.

27:53.618 --> 27:56.742
- Just let us all go.
- Stop talking. Stop talking.

27:56.822 --> 28:00.190
Stop fucking talking! Shut up!

28:24.047 --> 28:25.904
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

28:25.984 --> 28:27.722
Congratulations.

28:27.802 --> 28:30.274
Yeah, what? What?

28:30.354 --> 28:34.224
You are the first hostage
who's going to fucking die today.

28:49.440 --> 28:52.108
I have to use the restroom.

28:56.013 --> 29:00.695
I have to use the restroom, and I prefer
not going right here in front of everyone.

29:09.059 --> 29:11.063
Shit. Is that it?

29:11.143 --> 29:12.728
Yeah.

29:19.269 --> 29:22.827
- How the fuck are you getting in there?
- It's a combo lock. It's nothing ugly.

29:22.907 --> 29:24.130
Really?

29:26.276 --> 29:28.032
How long?

29:28.112 --> 29:30.835
- 20 minutes.
- Here.

29:30.915 --> 29:33.204
- Stay on two.
- My favorite.

29:33.284 --> 29:34.818
Start.

29:39.691 --> 29:41.992
X marks the spot.

29:48.565 --> 29:50.087
Fuck.

29:50.467 --> 29:52.454
What the fuck is that?

30:03.246 --> 30:05.648
It's got to be a power surge or something.

30:18.161 --> 30:19.962
Watch him.

30:47.157 --> 30:49.806
<i>Unit 4919, what's your status?</i>

30:50.895 --> 30:54.156
<i>Unit 4919, are you still at 23-47?</i>

31:01.304 --> 31:03.173
Can you untie me?

31:06.509 --> 31:09.712
Can you please take the bag off my head?

31:12.415 --> 31:14.239
Don't move.

31:14.619 --> 31:16.452
You stay right there.

31:20.023 --> 31:21.790
Let's go.

31:26.396 --> 31:28.586
I can't pee when you're
pacing outside like that.

31:28.666 --> 31:30.955
What's that? Let's go. Let's hurry up.

31:31.035 --> 31:33.618
You're making me nervous. I can't pee.

31:33.698 --> 31:34.926
You what?

31:35.006 --> 31:40.285
I can't pee when you're pacing right
outside of the door like that. Please?

31:53.110 --> 31:54.932
I couldn't either.

31:57.161 --> 31:58.927
What's your name?

32:01.931 --> 32:03.499
Susan.

32:17.981 --> 32:19.989
Who's in charge?

32:21.351 --> 32:23.018
Who do you think?

32:25.856 --> 32:28.858
That's the problem.
It doesn't seem like anyone's in charge.

32:33.196 --> 32:34.998
Stop talking.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.731
Oh, fuck. You fuck.

33:53.311 --> 33:56.970
I know that your hand
is being forced right now...

33:58.750 --> 34:03.227
...and I don't know by who or why.

34:06.990 --> 34:09.259
I don't hear you pissing in there.

34:18.068 --> 34:20.569
- You got any sisters?
- Yeah.

34:21.049 --> 34:23.293
Yeah? You love them?

34:23.674 --> 34:25.929
Yeah. I do.

34:26.010 --> 34:29.730
- That's good.
- Are those your sisters out there?

34:33.016 --> 34:36.927
You're not like the others.
You don't want to hurt people.

34:38.206 --> 34:42.272
I know you tried to help that policeman.

34:43.828 --> 34:46.496
I know you're not a bad person.

34:50.233 --> 34:54.493
You know, sometimes you just don't
want to piss off the wrong people...

34:55.572 --> 34:57.761
...no matter what you're trying to do.

35:05.915 --> 35:07.717
What happened?

35:09.819 --> 35:12.311
I stiffed the wrong guys, Susan.

35:13.591 --> 35:15.658
And I owe them a lot of money.

35:21.731 --> 35:23.573
So we're here...

35:25.546 --> 35:28.972
...and my sisters...
my sisters are helping me.

35:32.742 --> 35:34.566
Let's go.

35:35.346 --> 35:37.236
I don't hear any piss.

35:38.316 --> 35:40.158
I can't pee.

35:52.529 --> 35:54.731
Susan, we're not here to hurt anybody.

35:59.802 --> 36:01.393
All right?

36:02.773 --> 36:04.574
Let's go.

36:09.279 --> 36:11.481
You need to see a doctor.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.174
Please, let me...

36:17.254 --> 36:18.776
Please?

36:19.556 --> 36:21.358
I want to help you.

36:24.544 --> 36:26.585
You're a good person.

36:28.065 --> 36:31.090
I know it's not in your heart
to do this, please?

36:32.370 --> 36:35.226
You have my word
you're gonna go home to your family.

36:35.306 --> 36:37.107
I promise you.

36:40.777 --> 36:42.265
Put that on.

36:47.484 --> 36:49.319
All right, let's move.

36:53.523 --> 36:58.370
Move, move, move. Right there. Right there.
Right there. Right there. Go, go, go.

36:58.930 --> 37:01.519
What's going on?
Why are you not cutting the pipe?

37:01.599 --> 37:02.687
I'm going right now.

37:02.767 --> 37:05.386
We need to make sure
that we have a way out of here.

37:05.466 --> 37:07.270
I'm doing it.

37:22.418 --> 37:25.421
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

37:27.890 --> 37:29.813
What's up?

37:29.893 --> 37:32.483
I'm shaken up right now. Like, do
you think we've overlooked somebody?

37:32.563 --> 37:34.986
Like there's someone in the back I think.

37:35.066 --> 37:37.838
You gotta... Leah says we're falling behind.

37:37.918 --> 37:40.755
I don't fucking care. You hear what I said?

37:40.835 --> 37:44.529
Yeah, I heard you. I don't know.

37:44.609 --> 37:47.158
What the fuck do you think,
we're just gonna like slip out the back...

37:47.238 --> 37:50.762
...with a fucking pile of money, and
everything's just gonna be like dandy again?

37:50.982 --> 37:53.404
You'll buy some big fucking
mansion in Stillwood Park...

37:53.484 --> 37:57.108
...and maybe we'll get some daisies
and lay them on Mama's grave.

37:57.188 --> 38:00.011
And we'll be a big happy family again.

38:00.091 --> 38:04.348
Come on, Aaron. You know I fucking love
Leah to death, but you know the minute...

38:04.428 --> 38:07.919
...the minute this shit's done, she's out.
Like always. She's gonna be out.

38:07.999 --> 38:11.222
As soon as we fucking do this,
she's gonna be gone.

38:11.302 --> 38:13.691
I know it. You know it.

38:13.771 --> 38:15.420
I don't know it.

38:16.740 --> 38:18.541
Who cares?

39:07.157 --> 39:10.027
Hey. So what's up?

39:11.395 --> 39:13.238
- He's doing well.
- Oh, yeah?

39:13.318 --> 39:15.031
He's fine.

41:19.188 --> 41:20.690
Kramer?

41:35.971 --> 41:37.473
Vee?

41:52.705 --> 41:56.259
What's he looking at?
What the fuck are you looking at?

42:02.098 --> 42:05.135
Get the fuck upstairs with the others.

42:24.653 --> 42:26.177
<i>Vee?</i>

42:27.157 --> 42:28.959
There's people down here.

42:32.662 --> 42:34.550
- Come on, dude.
- Kramer.

42:36.366 --> 42:39.056
- Piece of shit.
- Give it to me.

42:39.136 --> 42:41.793
Kramer? Can you hear me?

42:43.273 --> 42:45.446
- Kramer, you all right?
- There's no one down there.

42:45.526 --> 42:49.512
<i>Hey, we can actually see you
on the monitor, but what are you staring?</i>

43:00.990 --> 43:03.291
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, he's just like...

43:03.595 --> 43:06.796
...what is he looking at?
Is he looking out in the hall?

43:09.398 --> 43:11.201
<i>There's people.</i>

43:20.342 --> 43:23.199
What the fuck? It keeps doing that.
Was it doing that up here?

43:23.279 --> 43:25.501
It was doing that down there.

43:48.787 --> 43:50.836
Did you just fucking see that?

43:56.611 --> 43:58.881
What the fuck just happened?

44:03.886 --> 44:06.408
Is there someone down there?
Is there someone down there?

44:06.488 --> 44:09.499
Have you seen somebody when I wasn't
up here? Was there someone down there?

44:09.579 --> 44:12.862
- I'm going down there. Fucking wake up!
- No one's down there.

44:16.999 --> 44:19.690
Michael, we need you
in the lobby with the keys.

44:19.770 --> 44:21.948
Cyrus, count the hostages.

44:59.860 --> 45:03.313
Michael, we need you up here
with the keys to the basement.

45:07.750 --> 45:10.420
<i>Cyrus, count the hostages.</i>

45:14.423 --> 45:16.292
Hold on.

45:21.030 --> 45:23.464
The fucking door's locked.

45:28.905 --> 45:30.373
Come on.

48:52.741 --> 48:54.243
Michael?

49:10.793 --> 49:13.794
No lies. Short answers.

49:14.998 --> 49:17.017
What the fuck is down there?

49:17.801 --> 49:19.690
I swear to God I don't know.

49:20.270 --> 49:22.125
- Did you set us up?
- No.

49:22.205 --> 49:23.894
- You fucking set us up.
- No.

49:23.974 --> 49:27.264
Who the fuck is down there?
Do not fucking lie to me.

49:27.344 --> 49:29.900
Please, I don't want you
to get upset and hurt anyone.

49:29.980 --> 49:33.215
You promised that you wouldn't
hurt anyone if I helped you.

49:36.385 --> 49:38.710
- You're lying.
- No.

49:39.970 --> 49:42.125
- You're lying.
- No.

49:48.597 --> 49:50.467
Who's calling?

49:53.736 --> 49:55.626
I don't know.

49:56.406 --> 49:57.907
Okay.

50:07.183 --> 50:09.098
Make them go away.

50:12.254 --> 50:15.112
Centurion Trust. How may I help you?

50:15.192 --> 50:17.848
<i>Can I please speak to whoever's in charge?</i>

50:18.328 --> 50:19.965
Hold, please.

50:22.698 --> 50:24.734
They want to talk to you.

50:31.006 --> 50:32.596
<i>Hello?</i>

50:33.176 --> 50:36.234
<i>This is Detective Tom Iger. Hello?</i>

50:37.544 --> 50:40.689
<i>Listen, I'm here to help work this out.</i>

50:57.967 --> 50:59.556
<i>Hello?</i>

51:01.104 --> 51:03.694
<i>Can you tell me if everyone's okay in there.</i>

51:03.774 --> 51:05.851
<i>Let's start there at least.</i>

51:08.244 --> 51:09.812
<i>Hello?</i>

51:13.749 --> 51:15.288
<i>I'm here.</i>

51:15.368 --> 51:18.006
<i>Can you let me know you're hearing me okay?</i>

51:19.222 --> 51:22.412
<i>Listen, I get it.</i>

51:22.492 --> 51:24.715
<i>This was supposed to be simple.</i>

51:24.795 --> 51:27.285
<i>Now, it's a different situation.</i>

51:28.765 --> 51:33.190
<i>If you let them go right now,
we can still make this right.</i>

51:33.670 --> 51:35.992
<i>I will work with you every step of the way...</i>

51:36.072 --> 51:39.530
<i>...and I promise you we will make it
right and no one gets hurt.</i>

51:39.610 --> 51:42.819
This is how this is gonna go, Detective.
You're gonna give me 30 minutes...

51:42.899 --> 51:46.837
...and I'll pretend that you never called and
I'll make sure that everyone gets out okay.

51:46.917 --> 51:49.339
The other option, you push us
and these people will die.

51:49.419 --> 51:52.167
- Do you understand me, Detective?
- <i>I promise you, we can work...</i>

51:52.247 --> 51:56.292
The other option, you push us,
and these people will die.

52:07.737 --> 52:10.227
Somebody has a line to the outside.
It's one of your people.

52:10.307 --> 52:12.963
- That's not possible. It doesn't work...
- Why are you lying to me?

52:13.043 --> 52:15.635
It doesn't make sense. It's not protocol.

52:18.697 --> 52:20.522
Who's your head teller?

52:22.452 --> 52:24.545
Who the fuck is your head teller?

52:26.757 --> 52:30.029
Susan Reynolds. Number seven.

52:30.109 --> 52:32.722
- Thank you.
- Please don't hurt her.

52:46.775 --> 52:48.332
Kramer?

52:48.812 --> 52:50.313
Michael?

52:54.016 --> 52:57.019
Shit. Oh, my God.

53:18.407 --> 53:20.517
Okay, no lies.

53:20.597 --> 53:23.986
Short answers. Did you call the police?

53:24.915 --> 53:28.584
- How could I have?
- Then what the fuck is going on?

53:32.521 --> 53:34.957
Answer the fucking question!

53:38.560 --> 53:41.371
It was... the bank.

53:41.451 --> 53:42.967
The what?

53:43.667 --> 53:45.719
You're not gonna believe me...

53:45.799 --> 53:48.671
...and I don't want you to hurt anyone.

53:50.806 --> 53:52.674
Try me.

53:54.843 --> 53:57.317
There's something down there...

53:57.716 --> 53:59.565
...in the basement.

54:00.336 --> 54:02.139
The vault.

54:04.756 --> 54:06.602
We're not alone.

54:08.191 --> 54:12.282
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm telling you the truth.

54:12.362 --> 54:14.434
Who's down there?

54:14.514 --> 54:17.396
No one goes down there, not even security...

54:19.015 --> 54:22.159
...because of what happened back in 1982.

54:22.239 --> 54:24.440
A man tried to rob the bank.

54:33.549 --> 54:35.818
<i>Someone got a line out.</i>

54:39.354 --> 54:43.592
<i>The man, he was deranged.
He held them hostage for days.</i>

54:46.160 --> 54:48.444
No food, no water...

54:48.524 --> 54:50.888
...he demanded transportation, a way out...

54:50.968 --> 54:55.404
...but the police, they kept stalling,
and then he... he snapped.

54:58.240 --> 55:02.698
<i>He made them shoot each other,
starting with the bank manager.</i>

55:05.647 --> 55:08.171
- He dies.
- I can't.

55:08.251 --> 55:11.541
Or I kill two more and you.

55:13.621 --> 55:15.624
Do it.

55:15.704 --> 55:17.472
Now!

55:25.834 --> 55:29.670
The ones that got away, he hunted them down.

55:30.741 --> 55:33.407
One was executed in the depository...

55:34.177 --> 55:38.435
...another one, a desk clerk,
a young woman...

55:38.515 --> 55:41.232
...was found by the basement boiler.

55:44.203 --> 55:46.626
<i>They kept finding bodies.</i>

55:47.457 --> 55:51.684
<i>Some had been burned alive in the vault.</i>

56:39.509 --> 56:42.798
<i>They all died. Every one of them.</i>

56:42.878 --> 56:46.802
<i>And they never caught the man,
no body, nothing.</i>

56:46.882 --> 56:51.355
Gone. No one saw his face,
no one knew who he was.

56:53.688 --> 56:57.012
You think something like that
just goes away with a paint job?

56:57.092 --> 57:01.650
It's still here. Ask anyone who's been
here, and they'll tell you the same.

57:01.730 --> 57:05.109
Something is still down there...

57:05.189 --> 57:08.830
...in the basement in the old bank.

57:15.676 --> 57:19.135
That was good. That was really good.

57:19.915 --> 57:22.137
I felt like I was there.

57:22.217 --> 57:24.274
The man in the mask.

57:25.054 --> 57:28.977
He just snapped? I don't like ghost stories.

57:29.157 --> 57:31.380
You can make this different.

57:31.460 --> 57:34.116
You can walk out that door right now...

57:34.196 --> 57:36.631
...and you can make this right.

57:55.850 --> 57:57.972
This is 120 volts.

58:01.522 --> 58:05.113
And I'd be lying if I said
this wasn't gonna hurt...

58:05.193 --> 58:07.462
...and I wasn't gonna enjoy it.

58:12.867 --> 58:14.951
What are you doing to her?

58:15.971 --> 58:17.827
Why is she on the floor?

58:18.307 --> 58:19.760
You've...

58:24.840 --> 58:26.368
Okay.

58:26.448 --> 58:29.238
Michael? Michael?

58:29.518 --> 58:31.273
Michael.

58:31.353 --> 58:33.809
We had one rule.

58:33.889 --> 58:36.611
One. Fuck!

58:36.691 --> 58:40.383
The cops are outside.
We need to get out of here.

58:41.163 --> 58:44.565
Don't fucking touch me.
We had one fucking rule.

58:44.930 --> 58:46.375
Okay.

59:15.612 --> 59:17.481
What happened?

59:19.851 --> 59:21.653
Kramer's dead.

59:23.322 --> 59:24.846
What?

59:26.526 --> 59:28.941
He took this drill bit
and put it to his head.

59:31.930 --> 59:33.765
He's dead.

59:39.221 --> 59:41.090
Something's going on here.

59:44.193 --> 59:46.395
Something's not right about this place.

59:50.866 --> 59:53.555
I'm... I'm sorry about this.

59:58.507 --> 01:00:00.742
You've always been there for me.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.516
We're gonna get out of here.

01:00:09.718 --> 01:00:12.587
I swear to God,
we're going to get out of here.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.837
There's five times more where that came from.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:37.340
- What are you guys doing up here?
- Michael says Kramer's dead.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.602
- What?
- Kramer's dead.

01:00:39.682 --> 01:00:42.038
- He's not.
- The cops are outside.

01:00:42.118 --> 01:00:44.275
They just called. They know we're here.

01:00:45.555 --> 01:00:48.056
- Cops are here?
- Yeah.

01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:51.060
So.

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:56.464
Fuck that.

01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:05.047
Okay, all right, we just go back
to the original plan then. We're good.

01:01:05.127 --> 01:01:06.964
We'll be home free.

01:01:07.614 --> 01:01:11.439
This doesn't make any sense.
Something's not right. These bills...

01:01:12.815 --> 01:01:16.000
...these bills are all from the same year.
These are all from 1982.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.388
It's all from 1982.

01:01:19.688 --> 01:01:22.049
- Every bill is from 1982.
- No, it's not.

01:01:22.129 --> 01:01:23.953
Every single bill.

01:01:25.094 --> 01:01:27.450
Who cares? It's money.
Isn't that what you want?

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:30.587
- Isn't that what this is about?
- Vee! Listen to me for a minute.

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:34.590
- This doesn't make any fucking sense.
- You're losing it, and you're losing it.

01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:37.268
- This has triggered some stuff in your brain.
- Vee!

01:01:37.348 --> 01:01:41.129
Are you coming at me again? 'Cause I'm not
gonna deal with it. I'm not dealing with it.

01:01:41.209 --> 01:01:45.234
You fucking ruined my life.
Is that... are you good yet?

01:01:45.314 --> 01:01:47.749
Is money going to make you happy?

01:01:49.452 --> 01:01:53.042
You owe me. You don't give a fuck
about anybody but yourself.

01:01:53.122 --> 01:01:56.378
You're going to walk away as soon
as we're fucking done, right?

01:01:56.458 --> 01:02:01.734
Am I right? I'm usually right about you,
and how much you have hurt me...

01:02:01.814 --> 01:02:04.082
...and this fucking family.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.225
If you would just say
you're fucking sorry. Can you?

01:02:09.305 --> 01:02:11.594
Can you say you're sorry?

01:02:11.674 --> 01:02:15.094
- You owe me. You fucking owe me.
- Get down.

01:02:21.716 --> 01:02:23.517
Crazy bitch.

01:02:25.086 --> 01:02:27.710
- What the hell is happening?
- I don't know.

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:30.080
But your window just blew out.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.183
What are you going to do?

01:02:34.103 --> 01:02:37.120
You're the only one thinking straight,
so what are you going to do?

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.056
What? I don't fucking know.

01:02:40.136 --> 01:02:43.125
We're gonna get the fucking money
and get out of here. The plan.

01:02:43.205 --> 01:02:46.162
- I'm telling you, she's losing it.
- I know.

01:02:46.242 --> 01:02:49.841
She's going to crack.
Okay? I don't trust her.

01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:51.903
Neither should you. I've seen this before.

01:02:51.983 --> 01:02:54.804
I know how it ends. People are
gonna die unless you do something.

01:02:54.884 --> 01:02:56.706
No, they're not.

01:02:57.486 --> 01:02:59.576
No, they're not.

01:03:01.556 --> 01:03:03.424
No one's gonna die.

01:03:05.526 --> 01:03:07.395
Not even you.

01:03:43.064 --> 01:03:44.907
- What's their next move?
- I don't know.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:47.823
- Why the fuck are they shooting at us?
- I don't know.

01:03:47.903 --> 01:03:51.762
- Tell me right fucking now.
- I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

01:03:51.842 --> 01:03:53.702
My guess is...

01:03:54.626 --> 01:03:56.181
...it's a mistake.

01:03:56.261 --> 01:03:58.868
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No. No.

01:03:58.948 --> 01:04:01.149
It's a mistake.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:05.648
Emotions are as high out there
as they are in here. There's...

01:04:05.728 --> 01:04:08.177
...confusion, miscommunication.

01:04:08.257 --> 01:04:12.318
You assumed they're organized out there.
I guarantee you they are not organized.

01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:19.388
There are probably 3 different departments
all vying for command, Police, FBI, ATF.

01:04:19.468 --> 01:04:22.959
Who the hell knows. You don't know
who's in charge and neither do they.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:26.128
Why would they do that?

01:04:26.608 --> 01:04:28.676
It's not a strategic move.

01:04:30.711 --> 01:04:34.237
- Unless...
- Unless what?

01:04:34.617 --> 01:04:36.707
Unless they're trying to isolate you.

01:04:38.087 --> 01:04:40.309
They need to see movement, good faith.

01:04:40.389 --> 01:04:41.777
How?

01:04:41.857 --> 01:04:45.548
- Release a hostage. It'll buy you time.
- No fucking way.

01:04:45.628 --> 01:04:49.698
The only way to save yourself
is to end this peacefully.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.335
Do you think I want to be here?

01:04:56.004 --> 01:04:58.206
I'm a hostage just like you.

01:05:16.223 --> 01:05:17.725
Please.

01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:37.712
Help me.

01:05:54.862 --> 01:05:58.029
- What the fuck is that?
- An outgoing call.

01:06:00.835 --> 01:06:03.525
<i>Hello. This is Centurion Trust.</i>

01:06:03.605 --> 01:06:07.262
<i>We have a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:09.531
<i>Please send the police.</i>

01:06:09.611 --> 01:06:11.667
<i>In progress right now.
They're in the building.</i>

01:06:11.747 --> 01:06:13.502
Can you describe the assailant?

01:06:13.582 --> 01:06:16.417
<i>They're taking hostages, so as soon...</i>

01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:55.273
Hey.

01:07:01.712 --> 01:07:05.149
Please, don't hurt me. Please.

01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:14.425
No, no, no, no, nobody...
nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:07:17.796 --> 01:07:19.631
What's your name?

01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:24.268
Samantha.

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:29.517
- Samantha Campbell.
- What happened to you, Samantha?

01:07:29.809 --> 01:07:32.210
My ankle, I think it's broken.

01:07:36.281 --> 01:07:38.037
Yeah?

01:07:38.117 --> 01:07:40.151
You're not one of them, are you?

01:07:42.586 --> 01:07:45.078
What do you mean? I'm not one of who?

01:07:46.558 --> 01:07:48.369
Michael!

01:08:07.245 --> 01:08:09.335
- What are you doing, Detective?
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

01:08:09.415 --> 01:08:13.639
<i>We spotted what we thought was a civilian
in distress, and an order was given.</i>

01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:16.325
<i>But you have my word. We're standing down.</i>

01:08:16.404 --> 01:08:19.763
<i>We don't want anyone to get hurt.
Including you. You have my word on that.</i>

01:08:19.843 --> 01:08:21.852
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?

01:08:23.212 --> 01:08:25.868
I can only control these guys for so long.

01:08:25.948 --> 01:08:28.337
<i>Same as me. So you gotta
give us something to work with.</i>

01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:29.970
Okay.

01:08:30.451 --> 01:08:33.388
Okay. I'm gonna give you
something to work with.

01:08:42.965 --> 01:08:44.487
Michael?

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.991
Where are you?

01:08:48.871 --> 01:08:50.460
Michael?

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.743
Michael!

01:09:01.049 --> 01:09:02.493
Michael!

01:09:04.853 --> 01:09:06.921
Where are you?

01:09:19.367 --> 01:09:23.259
Right now, there are hostages at gunpoint.
If anything happens to me, two of them die.

01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:27.395
- Do you understand?
- I hear you loud and clear.

01:09:27.475 --> 01:09:31.511
We're not going to let that happen, okay?
We're going to work through this.

01:09:36.317 --> 01:09:37.818
Who called?

01:09:39.287 --> 01:09:41.560
We never received any phone calls.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.551
I fucking heard the call. Who called?

01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:48.080
We got something on the radio.
It was garbled. It sounded like trouble.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.020
That was it. No phone call.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.929
Get out of here.

01:09:54.209 --> 01:09:55.736
Go.

01:09:57.938 --> 01:09:59.190
Wait.

01:10:11.018 --> 01:10:13.642
<i>Hello. This is Centurion Trust.</i>

01:10:13.722 --> 01:10:17.246
<i>We have a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

01:10:17.326 --> 01:10:19.414
<i>Please send the police.</i>

01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:21.464
<i>In progress right now.
They're in the building.</i>

01:10:21.544 --> 01:10:25.090
<i>They're taking hostages,
so as soon as you can.</i>

01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:36.812
Did you hear it?

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.326
Michael? Hey, come on.

01:11:04.406 --> 01:11:07.329
- Michael, I'm serious.
- Look at me. Look at me. Hey, listen.

01:11:07.409 --> 01:11:10.065
This hallway, to the right,
there's a first door to the water main.

01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:13.668
There's a big hole. Everything's ready. Just
hop in there, and you get out of here, okay?

01:11:13.748 --> 01:11:16.772
When we get out of here, we're going to do
everything we wanted to do, all right?

01:11:16.852 --> 01:11:19.542
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Look at me.

01:11:20.622 --> 01:11:22.178
Michael?

01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:24.713
- What? Look, I'm serious.
- I'll see you soon, all right?

01:11:24.793 --> 01:11:26.722
Come with me. Please.

01:11:27.162 --> 01:11:29.511
- I'll see you soon.
- Michael, I'm serious. Come on.

01:11:30.636 --> 01:11:31.936
Alright.

01:11:32.016 --> 01:11:34.235
Shit. Jesus.

01:11:48.015 --> 01:11:49.606
Holy shit.

01:11:51.786 --> 01:11:53.307
Fuck.

01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:26.241
Now they have to come in.
The police, they have no choice.

01:12:27.621 --> 01:12:29.704
Please, you have to let them go.

01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:43.959
- Go.
- Maybe I was wrong about you.

01:12:44.539 --> 01:12:46.040
Go.

01:13:15.536 --> 01:13:17.727
Hey. Hey.

01:13:17.807 --> 01:13:20.054
Hey, come on. Get up.

01:13:27.115 --> 01:13:28.604
Hey!

01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:30.352
Don't go down there.

01:14:15.796 --> 01:14:20.468
Come on. You're gonna be okay.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:15:20.127 --> 01:15:21.859
Leah!

01:16:57.524 --> 01:17:00.769
Keep moving. I'll be right behind you.

01:17:04.848 --> 01:17:06.376
Michael!

01:17:18.228 --> 01:17:19.796
Michael!

01:17:43.286 --> 01:17:44.855
Michael!

01:18:50.571 --> 01:18:52.216
No.

01:18:53.491 --> 01:18:57.539
- You take care of your sister.
- I'm not leaving without you.

01:18:57.619 --> 01:18:59.185
Go!

01:19:00.865 --> 01:19:02.749
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:19.817 --> 01:19:23.108
<i>Police are investigating last night's
armed robbery and arson...</i>

01:19:23.188 --> 01:19:24.910
<i>...of the Centurion Trust Bank.</i>

01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:28.047
<i>According to a statement released
by the department this morning...</i>

01:19:28.127 --> 01:19:32.213
<i>...at about 5:15 p.m., police responded
to a call from inside the bank...</i>

01:19:32.293 --> 01:19:36.388
<i>...where six employees and one patron
were being held hostage at gunpoint.</i>

01:19:36.468 --> 01:19:39.433
<i>Bank employees described five bank robbers...</i>

01:19:39.513 --> 01:19:43.662
<i>...three white males, two white females.
The robbers were armed.</i>

01:19:43.742 --> 01:19:46.317
<i>The bank employees were transported
to Grant Hospital...</i>

01:19:46.397 --> 01:19:49.193
<i>...where they were treated
for injuries and were later released.</i>

01:19:49.273 --> 01:19:52.838
<i>The robbers are all believed to have died
in the fire, authorities have said.</i>

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:56.122
<i>The forecast, plenty of sunshine
through today...</i>

01:20:34.043 --> 01:20:37.461
- I heard on the radio...
- They're saying that we're dead.

01:20:43.634 --> 01:20:45.635
What was that?

01:20:50.174 --> 01:20:52.376
What did you see down there?

01:20:57.781 --> 01:21:00.505
Because I know what I saw. We were attacked.

01:21:00.585 --> 01:21:02.401
By the police.

01:21:03.438 --> 01:21:05.661
No, it's not the police.

01:21:06.341 --> 01:21:08.809
Come on, tell me, you saw.

01:21:12.262 --> 01:21:15.393
I don't know what I fucking saw,
all right? I saw you hesitate...

01:21:15.473 --> 01:21:18.513
...when we were supposed to be leaving
and the cops were trying to fucking kill us.

01:21:18.593 --> 01:21:21.720
And I saw the vault,
and I saw that it was empty...

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:25.225
...'cause someone went down there and
cleared it out. So where's the money?

01:21:28.929 --> 01:21:31.331
Where is the fucking money, Leah?

01:21:54.688 --> 01:21:56.556
Where's Michael?

01:22:06.365 --> 01:22:10.125
Wait, you were with him. You didn't...
you didn't take care of him?

01:22:10.205 --> 01:22:13.670
- He wouldn't come with me. I tried.
- Where is he?

01:22:17.444 --> 01:22:20.080
He's dead, Vee.

01:22:32.559 --> 01:22:34.428
Don't touch me.

01:23:33.653 --> 01:23:37.445
This guy that you're talking about. He's not
showing up on any of the camera footage.

01:23:37.525 --> 01:23:40.749
None of the cameras, he's not there.
He's not anywhere to be found.

01:23:40.829 --> 01:23:45.053
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying it just doesn't add up.

01:23:45.133 --> 01:23:48.798
You know this bank inside and out,
vault's customers throughout the years...

01:23:48.878 --> 01:23:52.727
...and yet, you don't
recognize this individual.

01:23:53.507 --> 01:23:56.121
I've got six positive IDs...

01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:59.834
...six hostages, but you're
telling me that there's seven.

01:23:59.914 --> 01:24:03.304
I thought this was just a de-briefing?
Am I a suspect now too?

01:24:03.384 --> 01:24:06.040
They took your radio, your firearm.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.677
Any shred of dignity you had left...

01:24:09.157 --> 01:24:11.783
...well, I guess you didn't,
because they took that too, right?

01:24:12.293 --> 01:24:15.604
- Why did you get special treatment?
- What treatment?

01:24:15.864 --> 01:24:18.600
I was a hostage. I barely made it out.

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:22.323
You got your own room. You were
the only hostage that was let go.

01:24:31.745 --> 01:24:35.670
- How old was he?
- I don't remember. Forties, maybe.

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:40.008
- Did he say a name? Any names called?
- I don't remember any names.

01:24:40.088 --> 01:24:42.110
What were they talking about?

01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:46.114
- The vault. And the alarm.
- Could you make out a voice?

01:24:46.194 --> 01:24:52.421
He was telling them all the steps they
needed to make to disarm the alarm.

01:24:52.501 --> 01:24:54.523
So he did or did not work at the bank?

01:24:54.603 --> 01:24:56.805
He must have. He wouldn't know those things.

01:24:56.885 --> 01:24:59.027
How the fuck should I know?
Yeah, maybe he worked there.

01:24:59.107 --> 01:25:01.988
No, he was not a bank employee.

01:25:14.687 --> 01:25:18.009
- Did he say his name?
- He never said his name...

01:25:18.089 --> 01:25:21.970
...but I know everybody that's worked
at that bank for the past 10 years...

01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:26.254
- ...and I have never seen him there before.
- Are you saying you saw this man...

01:25:26.334 --> 01:25:30.024
...but he's not showing up
on any of the bank cameras.

01:25:30.104 --> 01:25:32.394
You realize that, don't you?

01:25:33.214 --> 01:25:37.031
All the cameras we have,
all the backup systems, he's...

01:25:37.111 --> 01:25:39.379
...I mean, he's nowhere to be found.

01:25:55.896 --> 01:26:00.514
You've seen employees come and go,
regional managers, auditors...

01:26:01.964 --> 01:26:04.572
...yet, you don't know who this guy is?

01:26:29.663 --> 01:26:32.220
<i>Hello, this is Centurion Trust.</i>

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.807
<i>We have a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

01:26:35.887 --> 01:26:38.593
<i>Please, send the police.
In progress right now.</i>

01:26:38.673 --> 01:26:43.162
They're in the building, they're taking
hostages, as soon as you can.

01:26:46.813 --> 01:26:48.615
That's him.

01:26:53.453 --> 01:26:55.655
Where? This guy?

01:26:56.823 --> 01:26:58.825
That's not possible.

01:27:02.429 --> 01:27:05.499
That's one of the original
hostages from 1982.

01:27:36.663 --> 01:27:38.619
What's wrong?

01:27:38.699 --> 01:27:40.500
It won't start.

01:27:42.836 --> 01:27:44.859
All right, pop the hood.

01:27:45.039 --> 01:27:48.108
And when I say crank it, try it.

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.350
Okay, try it.

01:28:26.179 --> 01:28:27.681
Fuck.

01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:32.852
Vee!
