WEBVTT

01:26.869 --> 01:29.350
Alrighty, we're
gearin' up to ring in
the New Year

01:29.393 --> 01:33.615
here at Snow Falls'
top-rated radio station
for the past 13 years in a row,

01:33.658 --> 01:37.488
and we wanna hear all
about your past, present,
and future New Year's Eves.

01:37.532 --> 01:40.491
Call in
with your wild
and craziest stories

01:40.535 --> 01:45.366
for a chance to win tickets
to the world-famous
Snow Falls Ski Resort.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.847
Following a tragic plane crash
in the East Hills area,

01:48.891 --> 01:50.371
we're still awaiting
information

01:50.414 --> 01:53.635
on how many passengers
were on board the aircraft,

01:53.678 --> 01:56.028
but it is believed
to be weather-related.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.683
...the highly
contagious SARS-like virus

01:58.727 --> 02:01.164
seems to be spreading
rapidly overseas.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.079
- On the--

02:09.564 --> 02:13.045
I thought you said
you weren't gonna study
at the cabin.

02:13.089 --> 02:16.875
We agreed I wouldn't
study at the cabin,
not in the car.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.358
Hey, how much longer?

02:21.402 --> 02:24.405
- GPS says 15 minutes.
- Thank God.

02:30.106 --> 02:34.806
You know, not to be
the mom of the group, but...

02:34.850 --> 02:38.549
that's really dangerous
if we wrecked.

02:38.593 --> 02:41.204
Em, you're so paranoid.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.380
Yeah, well, Kit refuses
to wear a seatbelt,

02:43.424 --> 02:45.208
which I think is worse.

02:45.252 --> 02:48.690
Well, I'm sorry that I like
to live on the edge, okay?

02:48.733 --> 02:52.868
- Plus, it's natural
selection, so...
- Natural selection.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.000
I mean, people need
organ donors.
Right, Eden?

03:25.857 --> 03:29.078
Damn, River. Is this
your family's second home?

03:29.121 --> 03:32.734
Uh, third, if you count
the one we built
in Martha's Vineyard.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.304
Jesus.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.877
Andy, you might wanna
sit down for this.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.662
There's, uh, no signal.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.360
Uh, you can sometimes get
service up on the hill,
but it's spotty.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.760
Quiet. It's what we came
here for, right?

04:05.288 --> 04:07.812
- Is there any Wi-Fi?
- Put those on the fridge.

04:07.856 --> 04:11.294
Uh, okay, so two bedrooms
downstairs, three upstairs,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.165
and you guys can fight
over the ones that you want,

04:13.209 --> 04:15.864
and Eden gets the master.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.344
Thanks.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.699
- Hey, neighbor.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.745
I'm takin' the room
across the hall.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.703
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:12.747 --> 05:15.576
Shot o'clock!
Kitchen, in five minutes!

05:23.061 --> 05:25.673
Hey, guys! I got
a little service after all.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.284
Oh.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.592
Hey, son, did you make it
there safe?

05:31.635 --> 05:33.507
Just walked in.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.552
Uh, can you--
can you hear me?

05:35.596 --> 05:37.380
The-- the connection's weak.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.295
- There safe?
- Um, uh, yeah,
there you go.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.905
Now, I know I don't need
to remind you,

05:40.949 --> 05:42.342
but take care
of the place,
all right?

05:42.385 --> 05:44.082
The antiques.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.302
And those are
some of your mother's
best dishes,

05:46.346 --> 05:49.523
so did you buy
the paper plates
I asked you to?

05:49.566 --> 05:53.222
- Yes.
- Good.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.615
And make sure
you tell everyone,

05:54.658 --> 05:56.356
no traipsing around the house

05:56.399 --> 05:58.749
after they get out
of the hot tub
before they've toweled off.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.490
- I know, it's cold,
but guess what?

06:00.534 --> 06:02.318
I spent a lot of money
on those floors, so...

06:04.146 --> 06:07.323
God, yes, Sheila!
I just told him
what you told me.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.850
Uh, just be really careful
with the plates, okay?

06:12.894 --> 06:15.462
I promise I've got
it all under control.

06:15.505 --> 06:18.247
All right, have fun.
Happy New Year.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.381
Dad? Hello?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.384
And we're out.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.782
I think I ate something.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.785
You're fine, babe.
Look, you always do this.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.962
I just don't wanna be sick
for the entire trip,
you know?

06:38.006 --> 06:39.921
It's in your head,
you hypochondriac.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.792
- Just relax!

06:45.056 --> 06:46.754
- Oh, this will do nicely.
- Oh, wow.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.408
- How romantic.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.627
Okay, yeah, no.
We're gonna-- I don't--
fucking gonna do that.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.368
- Oh.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.372
Break it in later.

07:02.291 --> 07:06.426
Alrighty, my friends.
I would like
to make a toast.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.298
- Dude, careful.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.692
- Sorry. So...
- Floor, please.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.041
Okay.

07:13.084 --> 07:16.000
Without further ado...

07:16.044 --> 07:17.828
let's get fucked up!

07:17.872 --> 07:19.743
- Whoo!
- Oh, cheers.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.397
- Okay. Oh.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.573
Cheers.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.575
Mm.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.577
- Ooh! Ooh!

07:27.621 --> 07:28.970
- Another?
- Nuh-uh.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.580
- Let's do it, let's do it.
- Here we go.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.983
What the hell is that?

07:42.026 --> 07:44.159
I am building
the best snowman
you've ever seen.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.422
That is
a very interesting snowman.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.510
Well, I'm not done yet.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.382
- Dude, watch it!
Come on!

07:50.426 --> 07:52.863
Man, I don't want snow
on my face. Dude,
I have asthma, seriously.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.343
Shut up.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.040
All right, fine,
I have no choice then.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.520
Okay, I hope this is
good content for you.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.609
- Come on.
- Are you really
gonna film this now?

07:59.653 --> 08:01.089
Oh.
Shit. Hey!

08:01.132 --> 08:02.612
- All right,
get the shot you want.
- Dude, my phone.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.222
- Here-- Point it this way.
- Calm down.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.877
What? Hey!

08:08.270 --> 08:10.490
- Can I please
finish my snowman?
- Fine.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.414
- Hey.
- Yeah?

08:23.546 --> 08:28.029
I'm-- I'm really sorry
I didn't make it
to the funeral.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.204
Don't worry about it.

08:30.074 --> 08:34.209
- No, I should--
I should have been there.
- Hey, really, it's okay.

08:34.252 --> 08:37.081
Nobody ever knows
what to say.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.476
Honestly, I don't even know
what I want them to say.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.738
Doesn't change anything.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.613
- Canonball! Whoo!
- What? Oh!

08:47.744 --> 08:50.878
- You guys, I'm kidding.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.576
The towels.
Don't lose them.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.969
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Dad.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.448
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.018
- You guys were joking.
- Calm down. Oh.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.892
- Yeah.
- Wow. Wow!

09:12.203 --> 09:14.641
- Coasters, please,
you know?

09:14.684 --> 09:17.469
Okay.
Dude, chill, okay?

09:17.513 --> 09:18.862
You're probably,
like, one of those weirdos

09:18.906 --> 09:21.212
who wears, like, two condoms
or something.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.605
If he ever had any sex.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.173
- Very true.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.088
But we know he only has
eyes for one girl.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.570
She's my best friend.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.441
Okay. Keep
tellin' yourself that.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.279
Dude, disconnect.

09:44.322 --> 09:47.587
Hey! Look, I have
11k followers now.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.676
And only like a third
of them were bought.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.983
- People expect to hear from me.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.857
Uh, Jace, that bastard.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.820
- There he is.
- Hey.

10:03.864 --> 10:07.345
Um, excuse me, I didn't ask
to be scheduled
on New Year's Eve.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.870
Yeah, no one's
making you work.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.524
First of all, you know,
I don't really like camping

10:12.568 --> 10:16.964
and secondly, the amount
of drunk tips I'm gonna
make tonight? Worth it.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.401
Plus, I heard there's, like,
a big storm headed your way.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.098
If I got stuck there
for an extra day,

10:21.142 --> 10:22.796
I would be fired for sure.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.233
I just think that you
don't wanna admit
you have FOMO.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.669
I cannot confirm nor deny.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.585
Hey, Eden, where you at?

10:32.153 --> 10:33.807
Hey, Jace.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.547
- A round on me
when you get back, okay?
- Sounds good.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.594
All right,
you guys have fun.

10:39.377 --> 10:42.163
I wish I was there,
but I will see you back here

10:42.206 --> 10:45.906
whenever the snow gods
will it to be so, okay?

10:45.949 --> 10:48.169
Don't drink too much.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.518
Or do, I don't care.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.955
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:54.088 --> 10:58.483
Well, on that note,
I say more shots.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.224
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.749
- More shots.
- More shots.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.054
- Come on.
- Okay.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.121
- Shit! What?
- Oh, I-- shit.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.601
I-- I'm so sorry.
Here, watch the shoes.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.734
Okay, no.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.127
All right, well,

11:33.170 --> 11:36.347
when we get home,
you're buying me a new one.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.914
- Deal.
- Okay.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.055
So what's for dinner?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.100
Stir-fry,
and everyone's helping.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.841
Oh, you want me
to make the "rie"?

12:01.982 --> 12:05.942
Mm. Maybe I'm mixing
too much? I don't know.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.901
I just don't think
it's normal

12:07.944 --> 12:10.251
that my stomach
is always this sensitive.

12:10.294 --> 12:14.298
Em, how many times do we all
have to assure you
that you're fine?

12:14.342 --> 12:16.953
- Trust me. Med student.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.565
It's better
than self-diagnosing online.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.438
Em is constantly convincing
herself that she's dying.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.874
I mean, to be fair,

12:24.918 --> 12:28.008
last week all my symptoms
pointed to cancer, so...

12:32.055 --> 12:36.146
I'm sorry, Eden. No, uh,
that was insensitive.

12:36.190 --> 12:39.497
I know
you didn't mean it.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.154
- Shit!
- Oh, what did you--

12:44.198 --> 12:45.503
Let me see.

12:45.547 --> 12:49.377
- Dammit.
- All right.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.771
In my professional opinion,
I think you'll live.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.949
Okay. Well, Em,
let this be
a lesson to you

12:55.992 --> 12:58.342
that men do not belong
in the kitchen.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.170
- Some of them do.
- I'm doin' a great job.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.478
Yes. He did a great--
great job cutting
all of that stuff.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.393
Hmm, okay.
Well, yay.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.699
- He's quite--
kind of really professional.
- You can never.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.225
Okay, guys,
we have eight seconds left
till the ball drops.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.227
Seven, six,

13:13.270 --> 13:16.796
- five, four, three...

13:16.839 --> 13:21.626
...two, one.
Happy New Year!

13:21.670 --> 13:25.021
Yes, Happy New Year!

14:19.771 --> 14:23.427
Hey.
You good?

14:23.471 --> 14:25.038
I'm good.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.739
Nothing like New Year's Eve
to remind you of how single
you are.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.875
I wasn't gonna ask,
but, uh...

14:37.093 --> 14:38.878
where's your guy tonight?

14:38.921 --> 14:42.490
Yeah, that guy?

14:44.144 --> 14:46.450
Yeah, what happened to him?

14:46.494 --> 14:48.888
Um...

14:48.931 --> 14:52.282
When my mom got sick,
he bolted, so...

14:52.326 --> 14:53.980
He couldn't deal.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.113
That's--

14:58.810 --> 15:00.464
- That's shitty.
- Yep.

15:02.771 --> 15:06.035
I mean,
thank God for you guys.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.732
Planning all this
just to cheer me up.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.866
I don't know what I did
to deserve--

15:10.910 --> 15:13.086
- You guys, look outside.
- What?

15:13.129 --> 15:16.611
Uh, dude, that's one
of my mom's favorite bowls.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.265
- It'll be fine.

15:18.308 --> 15:19.788
Where are you going?

15:30.146 --> 15:33.019
It's really coming down.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.979
Oh, my God.
Okay, remember that--

15:39.721 --> 15:43.943
- Uh, what's that for?
- Alcoholic snow cones.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.857
- What?
- I'm in.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.990
- I'm in, whatever.
Let's do it.

15:54.301 --> 15:57.173
Is this... sanitary?

15:57.217 --> 16:00.350
- Sure it is,
especially with the alcohol.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.482
Mm.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.571
Hmm.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.096
A winter storm warning
is in effect

16:07.140 --> 16:11.013
in and around the popular
skiing destination Snow Falls.

16:11.057 --> 16:14.190
Weather forecasters are
predicting blizzard conditions,

16:14.234 --> 16:17.367
heavy snowfall,
and a bomb cyclone.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.717
They are advising travelers
to be cautious

16:19.761 --> 16:23.808
and prepare for delays
as two powerful
back-to-back storms

16:23.852 --> 16:26.246
- produce widespread...
- Shit, that sounds kinda bad.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.685
We may not be goin' home
tomorrow after all.

16:33.514 --> 16:37.126
Well, on that note,
I'm gonna go to bed.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.607
Is that code for "I'm gonna
go study in my room alone"?

16:42.349 --> 16:46.005
No, it's-it's code
for I'm gonna go sleep.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.532
Whatever.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.192
- Sorry.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.455
Shit, sorry.

18:28.498 --> 18:32.111
- It's-- sorry, it's me.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.722
- Hey, what--
is the power out?
- Yeah.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.941
Uh, I went to check
the backup genny,

18:36.985 --> 18:39.509
but, uh, we're out of gas.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.251
- Holy shit.

18:42.295 --> 18:45.820
Dude, shut up.
It's part of the process.

18:45.863 --> 18:49.432
Okay, do you think the power
will be back on soon?

18:49.476 --> 18:52.392
I'm sure, it's never been out
for more than a day or so.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.526
Wait, so what are we
gonna do about heat?

18:58.137 --> 19:02.489
Uh, maybe a good idea
to gather in one area,

19:02.532 --> 19:04.926
like the living room,
fireside,

19:04.969 --> 19:08.451
and I'll close the vents,
don't let the cold air in.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.627
If we have to,
we can stuff towels
in the base of the doors.

19:10.671 --> 19:13.761
Yeah?
Sound like a plan?

19:13.804 --> 19:15.371
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.807
- Okay.
- Shut up.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.462
- Come on.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.624
Oh!

19:50.667 --> 19:51.973
Wakey-wakey, friends!

19:52.016 --> 19:53.801
Kit!

19:53.844 --> 19:56.456
The roads may be
out of commission,
but that doesn't mean we are.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.720
- Come on, wake up.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.548
- Dude, what you doing?
- Wake up.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.202
But the couch,
seriously.

20:09.425 --> 20:12.385
I walked all the way to the road
tryin' to get service.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.690
No luck.

20:14.909 --> 20:18.260
We should really
use the firewood sparingly,
there's not much.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.613
You can't even
see the road.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.356
Yeah.
We're not goin' anywhere.

20:35.669 --> 20:39.063
What could you possibly
be doing right now?

20:39.107 --> 20:41.370
I'm face-tuning selfies.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.851
If there's no service or Wi-Fi,
I gotta use my time wisely.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.855
"Wisely."

20:47.898 --> 20:50.945
I mean, how do you
put up with him?

20:50.988 --> 20:52.207
I mean, I--
I love him and all,

20:52.251 --> 20:54.688
but, I mean,
he loves himself a lot.

20:56.037 --> 20:59.083
Well, he puts up with my shit.
It's hard to find.

21:00.868 --> 21:04.306
No! Do you have to film
everything?

21:04.350 --> 21:08.310
I mean, Em doesn't let me
film everything.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.138
- Oh, Andy spilled the tea.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.184
Where did he spill it?

21:19.147 --> 21:22.281
What? Oh, okay.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.989
Guys, it's-it's dark outside.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.295
What are we gonna do
for light?

21:37.383 --> 21:41.082
Oh, right. I mean,
do you guys have any candles?

21:41.125 --> 21:43.519
Yeah, my parents
have a lot of candles.

21:43.563 --> 21:46.566
Uh, I think lanterns,
some more flashlights.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.089
Okay, great.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.700
Then let's, um,
let's light this place up.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.686
I'm freezing.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.038
Yeah, when do you think
the power will come back on?

22:24.081 --> 22:26.954
I thought
it would be by now.

22:26.997 --> 22:30.261
Maybe we could siphon the gas
from the cars for the generator.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.613
Mm, I don't think so.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.093
I mean, we'll need it to leave
when the snow clears.

22:36.137 --> 22:40.010
If.
If it clears.

22:40.054 --> 22:42.665
Okay, now
who's the paranoid one?

22:45.189 --> 22:48.367
Maybe we should
stop drinking.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.892
Most people think that booze
will keep you warmer,

22:51.935 --> 22:54.155
but, in reality,
it does the opposite,

22:54.198 --> 22:58.202
and alcohol prevents your body
from lots of its healthy
reflexes,

22:58.246 --> 23:01.380
one of which is keeping
the core body temperature warm
in colder weather.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.558
Screw that.

23:24.707 --> 23:27.014
Sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you up.

23:33.629 --> 23:36.850
I dream about my mom
sometimes.

23:39.983 --> 23:43.596
I miss her.
A lot.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.429
I'm cold.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.563
Me, too.

23:56.478 --> 24:00.787
No, I mean,
I am freezing, but--

24:03.050 --> 24:07.097
That's actually the last thing
she said to me in the hospital.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.233
"I'm cold."

24:17.325 --> 24:21.242
Now it just... feels
like a weird coincidence.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.256
Hey.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.870
I can't take this anymore.

24:42.742 --> 24:45.048
Let's try something.
Come on.

24:53.709 --> 24:54.928
Come on.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.024
Okay, for body heat, right?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.744
There's no luck.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.704
Look, we walked a while,
the roads are really bad.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.488
There's no way a car
is gonna make it.

25:33.532 --> 25:37.187
Yeah, you guys,
there's... "snow" way out.

25:38.885 --> 25:41.583
Come on.
Okay, I got one more.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.759
The snow has fallen
and it can't get up.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.720
You're an idiot.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.897
Okay, it's getting colder.
The house isn't holding heat.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.899
Yeah, and we're
almost out of firewood.

26:22.711 --> 26:26.149
Is-is this
all the dry wood we have?

26:28.325 --> 26:32.025
Right, we're low on food, too.
We need to ration
what we've got.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.551
Hey, why don't we
cut up some furniture
and burn that?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.248
Don't even
think about it.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.250
I mean, come on, man.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.557
Your parents would rather
you destroy a side table
than freeze to death.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.516
Nobody is gonna freeze
to death, okay?

26:45.560 --> 26:47.649
Look, we need to do
two things.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.783
First, we need to stay
as warm as possible.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.306
There's a few ways
we can do that.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.438
Sticking by the fire
is obviously ideal

26:54.482 --> 26:55.701
and I have
a few hand warmers.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.441
And, uh, water
that was already hot

26:57.485 --> 26:58.878
by the time
the-the power went out,

26:58.921 --> 27:01.750
it should still be warm
in the tank for a little while.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.840
And I turned off the heat,
uh, the power and the water
supply to the heater,

27:04.884 --> 27:06.929
just to keep what's left
as warm as possible.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.670
Yeah, and I-I've done
this camping before,

27:08.714 --> 27:10.541
where you put
hot water in a-in a bottle

27:10.585 --> 27:12.979
and you put it at your feet
in your sleeping bag

27:13.022 --> 27:16.069
or under your blanket.
Really works.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.728
Um, secondly,

27:22.771 --> 27:26.645
and, um, this might be
difficult...

27:29.517 --> 27:31.911
we need to stay awake.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.303
Why?

27:35.218 --> 27:37.656
Because when hypothermia
sets in...

27:38.961 --> 27:41.094
most times,
if you fall asleep...

27:42.704 --> 27:44.575
you won't wake up.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.907
Hey, hey.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.562
- You up?
- Yeah.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.650
Yeah. Should give us
a little bit more heat...

28:59.694 --> 29:01.827
when it's sunny.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.448
Could've swore we had
more groceries than this.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.844
Hey, sugar
isn't a good idea.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.890
Well, it's to stay awake.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.675
And it'll give you
a quick burst of energy,

29:24.719 --> 29:26.895
but then you'll crash.

29:29.202 --> 29:33.336
- Kit, come on.
- Frosty, the snow bitch.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.950
Told you. It'll only
make it worse.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.649
Kit.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.652
Don't you take
adde for ADD?

29:44.695 --> 29:47.046
Have you met him?
Of course he does.

29:49.483 --> 29:50.832
That's a good idea.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.240
I'm freezing.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.330
I can hardly feel my hands.

30:12.723 --> 30:16.162
Hey, you know,
with most gas stoves,

30:16.205 --> 30:18.207
you could just ignite it
with a match.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.502
Oh!
Yes, yes.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.983
Hey! Feels really good.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.267
Kit! Kit, what are you doing?!

31:24.099 --> 31:26.754
What were you thinking?
Guys!

31:50.821 --> 31:53.955
...the winter
storm is bringing
snow, sleet, and ice

31:53.999 --> 31:56.958
along with hundreds
of flight cancellations...

31:57.002 --> 31:59.874
...road conditions.
It's fixing up to be

31:59.918 --> 32:03.356
one of the worst snow storms
to hit in quite some time.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.448
- My last one.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.801
Okay, listen,

32:13.844 --> 32:17.674
I know that Kit
isn't the only one
feeling a little off.

32:17.718 --> 32:21.069
Cold's gettin' to me, too.

32:21.113 --> 32:22.288
Plus, we aren't sleeping.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.769
Fire is officially dead.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.904
What if it's the snow?

32:31.253 --> 32:32.820
What do you mean?

32:36.389 --> 32:38.347
I mean, think about it.

32:38.391 --> 32:41.089
How many movies have you seen
where, like, virus spreads

32:41.133 --> 32:43.004
or, like, a zombie plague,

32:43.048 --> 32:46.007
because the water supply
is tainted?

32:46.051 --> 32:47.226
Oh, shit.

32:48.270 --> 32:51.795
Right? I mean, uh,
what if the snow is--

32:51.839 --> 32:55.103
I don't know,
somehow contaminated?

32:55.147 --> 32:57.976
Didn't-- didn't we pass
the water treatment plant
on the way up here?

32:58.019 --> 33:02.415
Maybe. Uh, and I think
there's a military base
not far from here.

33:02.458 --> 33:06.027
Okay, stop, calm down.
I don't think that's it.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.464
You guys sound
like conspiracy theorists.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.862
- We ate it.
- What?

33:18.039 --> 33:20.955
We-- ate the snow,
all of us.

33:26.308 --> 33:31.400
My-- my stomach, I--
I knew that it was starting
to feel worse.

33:31.444 --> 33:35.970
No, no, babe. Look. you--
you always do this,
you know that.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.799
You get in your head
and you ruin things
for yourself.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.366
Think about it.

33:40.409 --> 33:42.063
You were excited
for this trip.

33:43.934 --> 33:47.112
Shit. Don't worry.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.680
I'm sure we're all fine.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.239
It was facing
the other way before.

34:42.645 --> 34:43.820
Guys...

34:47.520 --> 34:50.740
the snowman,
I think it's...

35:06.104 --> 35:07.148
Dude, are you okay?

35:07.192 --> 35:09.933
- I-- I thought, uh...
- What?

35:12.284 --> 35:15.417
Are you guys
messing with me?

35:15.461 --> 35:18.594
Of course not.
Why would you
even ask that?

35:32.173 --> 35:33.566
- Hey.
- Hmm?

35:35.437 --> 35:37.787
Do you think
it's possible?

35:37.831 --> 35:38.832
What?

35:39.833 --> 35:40.834
The snow.

35:43.315 --> 35:46.100
I think we're all
sleep-deprived,

35:46.144 --> 35:48.233
probably a little bit
hypothermic.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.191
Symptoms of both
would make sense here.

35:51.584 --> 35:54.239
Yeah, right.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.694
I have an idea.

36:18.350 --> 36:21.353
Why don't we say
our resolutions?

36:24.269 --> 36:26.880
It doesn't really feel
like the appropriate time.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.666
No.

36:30.710 --> 36:34.148
No, he's right.
It'd be a good exercise.

36:35.628 --> 36:38.065
Speaking of exercise, um,

36:38.108 --> 36:42.287
my resolution is
to make it to the gym
six times a week,

36:42.330 --> 36:44.941
- get below 8% body fat.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.293
It's heartwarming.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.512
I'll go.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.824
My New Year's resolution
is to survive.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.306
I'll second that.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.701
Well, while we
all agree there,

37:05.745 --> 37:07.877
it's a lazy answer.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.097
Then you go.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.015
Mine is to graduate.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.409
I mean,
now that my mom is gone,

37:17.452 --> 37:20.542
my career path
feels even more important.

37:20.586 --> 37:21.891
I wanna make her proud.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.592
- That's a good one.
- Thanks.

37:28.376 --> 37:29.812
What about you,
River?

37:31.074 --> 37:33.251
What's your New Year's
resolution?

37:37.342 --> 37:39.344
To get away
from you people.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.602
Em?

38:24.998 --> 38:27.087
Hey, have you guys seen Em?

38:27.130 --> 38:29.655
I dozed off
and she wasn't there
when I woke up.

38:42.755 --> 38:43.886
Oh, my God.

38:49.979 --> 38:51.067
Em!

38:58.118 --> 38:59.511
Bring her right here.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.779
Okay, everybody back up.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.694
Any excessive
or jarring movement

39:08.737 --> 39:10.913
could-could trigger
a cardiac arrest, okay?

39:10.957 --> 39:12.611
We don't know how long
she's been out there.

39:12.654 --> 39:15.309
- I'm here, Em.
I'm here.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.137
We need to get
these damp clothes off her.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.966
Gently, okay?
Start with the shoes, yes.

39:26.799 --> 39:27.713
Hey.

39:39.464 --> 39:42.641
Hey, how you feelin'?

39:45.905 --> 39:47.341
My stomach hurts.

39:52.868 --> 39:53.782
River.

39:54.783 --> 39:55.610
Oh.

39:56.698 --> 39:58.526
You don't look
so good.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.399
I'm feeling a little...

40:03.270 --> 40:04.445
sick.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.669
I keep thinking
about the snow.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.367
What about it?

40:15.238 --> 40:18.938
About it being... bad.

40:21.462 --> 40:24.857
About there being
something in it.

40:31.864 --> 40:36.085
Eden... can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a minute?

40:36.129 --> 40:38.958
Yeah. I'll be
right back, River.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.877
I'll be right back, okay?

41:02.068 --> 41:03.852
I asked her
why she did it.

41:05.027 --> 41:07.856
Why she--
why she went outside?

41:10.555 --> 41:13.427
She said it was
because it was warm
out there.

41:15.690 --> 41:18.693
She was confused,
hallucinating.

41:20.042 --> 41:22.871
This goes beyond
a little more
than discomfort,

41:22.915 --> 41:24.351
little shivering
and fatigue.

41:25.352 --> 41:28.224
Em is literally
losing her mind.

41:28.268 --> 41:30.270
She's obsessed
with this idea
about the snow.

41:30.313 --> 41:33.578
Yeah, and River's
pretty convinced of it too.

41:35.231 --> 41:36.755
I didn't even think
he was, like, serious

41:36.798 --> 41:38.147
when he came up
with that theory.

41:38.191 --> 41:41.107
That's how mass hysteria works.

41:41.150 --> 41:44.850
People feeding off
of each other's suggestions,

41:44.893 --> 41:48.331
literally making themselves
sick over getting sick.

41:48.375 --> 41:53.815
Plus, we're all tired
and cold, so...

41:55.643 --> 41:59.778
Hypothermia can cause
bizarre, risk-taking behavior

41:59.821 --> 42:02.476
because of confusion
and disorientation.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.740
And hunger doesn't help,

42:05.784 --> 42:08.787
not to mention the effects
of little to no sleep.

42:11.441 --> 42:14.619
Have you guys heard
of the Russian
sleep experiment?

42:14.662 --> 42:16.882
- What's that?
- It's an urban legend.

42:18.579 --> 42:22.017
Apparently,
it was an experiment
on sleep deprivation.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.238
In the '40s,

42:25.281 --> 42:27.588
there were five prisoners
who were put into a room

42:27.632 --> 42:33.028
that was pumped full
of this stimulant gas
to keep them awake.

42:33.072 --> 42:35.422
After only a few days,

42:35.465 --> 42:38.556
they were whispering
to themselves,

42:38.599 --> 42:42.342
turning on each other,
showing signs of paranoia.

42:42.385 --> 42:47.260
And when one of them
was screaming so loud
he tore his vocal cords,

42:47.303 --> 42:48.783
the rest of them
didn't even blink.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.614
By the end of it, they were
chewing their fingers
down to the bone,

42:53.658 --> 42:56.095
literally
feeding on themselves.

42:56.138 --> 42:58.793
Why are you
telling us this story?

42:58.837 --> 43:03.276
I'm just driving home the point
that there's no evil snow.

43:03.319 --> 43:05.800
We're all just run-down.

43:07.410 --> 43:11.153
But I am realizing
that we may need
to make a move soon.

43:13.025 --> 43:14.461
What kind of a move?

43:16.637 --> 43:18.030
The generator.

43:19.379 --> 43:21.033
No more waiting,
no more freezing.

43:22.338 --> 43:23.426
Em is sick.

43:24.471 --> 43:26.473
We siphon the gas
from our car.

43:28.780 --> 43:30.433
- I agree.
- Yeah, me too.

43:30.477 --> 43:32.087
Me as well.

43:34.220 --> 43:38.485
How about I go to the shed,
look for a siphon,

43:38.528 --> 43:39.791
let you know
once I found it?

43:41.096 --> 43:42.707
Yeah, thanks, River.

44:03.031 --> 44:05.033
He's been out there
for a while.

44:06.513 --> 44:07.514
Yeah.

44:08.558 --> 44:11.083
He was acting
kinda funny earlier,
don't you think?

44:13.259 --> 44:16.262
Yeah, maybe I'll go
check on him.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.875
Thank you.

44:30.232 --> 44:31.799
River!

44:35.847 --> 44:37.283
Where are you, man?

44:54.039 --> 44:57.216
- What the hell are you doing?
- We can't spread it.

44:57.259 --> 44:58.608
Spread what?

44:58.652 --> 45:00.872
The virus
or whatever it is.

45:02.438 --> 45:03.744
There is no virus.

45:06.529 --> 45:08.488
What have you done?

45:08.531 --> 45:10.229
We have to die.

45:11.230 --> 45:13.101
It has to die with us.

45:14.102 --> 45:15.451
We can't leave here.

45:22.328 --> 45:24.069
- Tell them!
- What is going on?

45:24.112 --> 45:27.594
You screwed up! He poured out
all the gas, all of it!

45:27.637 --> 45:30.336
- What the hell?
- River, why would you
do that?

45:30.379 --> 45:32.555
Dammit,
he's covered in gas!

45:40.389 --> 45:43.218
- What are you thinking?
- I--

45:45.003 --> 45:46.482
I'm sorry, guys.
I don't--

45:47.614 --> 45:49.224
Uh, I'm feeling
a little...

45:51.618 --> 45:54.142
You're just confused, okay?

45:54.186 --> 45:55.753
We're your friends.

45:57.058 --> 45:59.234
I know. I--

45:59.278 --> 46:01.193
You don't wanna hurt us.

46:01.236 --> 46:03.325
I know, I--

46:03.369 --> 46:05.501
I don't know
what came over me.

46:39.274 --> 46:41.276
Oh, my God.
Em's gone.

47:00.861 --> 47:02.994
- Em?

47:03.037 --> 47:05.039
Babe, are--
are you okay?

47:06.998 --> 47:08.434
I'm f-I'm fine.

47:08.477 --> 47:10.828
Just--
just leave me alone.

47:15.397 --> 47:17.269
Babe, you're scaring me
a little.

47:18.487 --> 47:20.707
Just open the door,
okay?

47:20.750 --> 47:23.666
- Em?

47:41.467 --> 47:45.558
- Open the door.

47:45.601 --> 47:47.212
Open the door, Em.

48:01.661 --> 48:03.097
- Em?

48:11.671 --> 48:14.021
Babe, just--
just open up, okay?

48:21.420 --> 48:23.683
Okay,
if you're in there,
back up. I'm coming in.

48:33.127 --> 48:34.433
- Oh, my God.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.351
What-what are you doing?

48:47.315 --> 48:51.189
I think I got it.
I think I got it out.

48:57.978 --> 48:59.414
No, that's deep.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.416
Thankfully, I don't think
she perforated her stomach,

49:01.460 --> 49:04.767
but I need
to close her up fast.

49:06.030 --> 49:07.640
There's a first-aid kit
in my bag.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.208
I'll do my best.

49:20.827 --> 49:23.438
Hey, buddy,
what you doin'?

49:25.179 --> 49:28.182
Cleaning.
My Mom will flip.

49:30.228 --> 49:33.666
Don't you think we have
more important things
to worry about at this point?

49:38.062 --> 49:40.978
I mean, you're down
on your knees

49:41.021 --> 49:42.631
scrubbing one of your best
friend's blood.

49:49.943 --> 49:51.510
Yeah, you're right.

49:53.512 --> 49:55.514
I'm not thinking clearly,
I guess.

50:32.290 --> 50:33.726
Asshole.

50:59.969 --> 51:01.754
She can't last long
like this.

51:04.148 --> 51:05.888
We can try to keep her warm
and comfortable,

51:05.932 --> 51:09.414
but I can only do so much.
She needs a real hospital.

51:15.898 --> 51:17.074
How's River?

51:18.205 --> 51:19.859
Uh...

51:21.730 --> 51:23.732
At the moment,
he seems okay.

51:26.866 --> 51:28.781
I don't understand
how it happened...

51:30.087 --> 51:31.479
how he changed that fast.

51:31.523 --> 51:35.135
He was... normal
last night.

51:40.706 --> 51:42.490
You know, I never finished
telling you my story

51:42.534 --> 51:44.536
about the Russian
sleep experiment.

51:45.667 --> 51:46.842
Okay.

51:51.020 --> 51:53.545
When the prisoners
were finally told
that they could leave...

51:55.286 --> 51:57.723
the researchers heard
this quiet voice

51:57.766 --> 52:00.552
over the microphone
they used to monitor them.

52:03.207 --> 52:06.645
It said, "We no longer
want to be free."

52:08.037 --> 52:12.433
River was willing
to sacrifice himself and us...

52:14.218 --> 52:15.871
for a hallucination.

52:18.352 --> 52:20.354
And Em cut herself open.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.752
It doesn't matter
if any of this
is actually real.

52:29.189 --> 52:31.800
The danger is real.

52:49.557 --> 52:50.950
Are you feeling better?

52:54.127 --> 52:55.476
I think so.

52:57.043 --> 52:59.176
I think my head's
just a little mixed up.

53:02.266 --> 53:04.093
I think I know
why you're feeling better.

53:05.573 --> 53:08.228
I found the stash
in your bag.

53:10.578 --> 53:12.928
- Shit.
- Hey, I get it.

53:13.799 --> 53:17.150
We're all scared,
we're all hungry...

53:18.804 --> 53:21.894
but you can't hoard
our groceries for yourself.

53:27.813 --> 53:30.207
I took it because...

53:32.426 --> 53:34.211
Well, in case,
we ran out of food--

53:35.429 --> 53:38.650
I was planning on--

53:38.693 --> 53:40.173
I was planning
on sharing it with you.

53:42.610 --> 53:43.959
I'm sorry, I--

53:45.047 --> 53:46.223
I'm sorry, I'll--

53:47.136 --> 53:48.747
I'll share with everyone.

53:51.053 --> 53:55.014
If you don't feed the mind,
it'll start feeding on itself.

53:55.057 --> 53:58.409
I think we'll all think
a little clearer
with food in our systems.

53:58.452 --> 54:01.238
Yeah.

54:06.982 --> 54:09.289
What-- What is he--

54:15.774 --> 54:17.558
- Dude, what are you doing?

54:19.081 --> 54:21.736
We need firewood, River.

54:21.780 --> 54:23.999
But that's an antique!

54:24.043 --> 54:27.002
Em is dying!
I have to warm her up!

54:27.046 --> 54:28.308
Stop!

54:28.352 --> 54:29.657
Look, we're freezing here

54:29.701 --> 54:31.703
and it's because of you
that we have no gas!

54:31.746 --> 54:33.748
I told you not to do that.

54:43.845 --> 54:45.369
- Em.

54:51.375 --> 54:52.854
Andy.

54:52.898 --> 54:54.595
Andy, dude, wake up.

54:59.470 --> 55:01.994
Andy, du-dude,
wake up.

55:02.037 --> 55:04.039
Get the fuck off.

55:11.525 --> 55:12.961
Baby...

55:14.354 --> 55:15.921
You killed him!

55:15.964 --> 55:19.794
I-- I didn't mean to.

55:19.838 --> 55:22.057
- No...

55:27.672 --> 55:28.977
Em!

55:33.025 --> 55:35.506
- I--
- No.

55:40.380 --> 55:41.555
I--

55:43.165 --> 55:46.168
I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

55:56.962 --> 56:00.226
I didn't mean to.

56:08.321 --> 56:11.368
Oh... Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

56:20.899 --> 56:22.248
Oh, my God, Jace!

56:22.291 --> 56:24.293
I've been trying to get ahold
of you guys for days!

56:24.337 --> 56:26.687
Yeah, yeah, we're snowed in,
and the power is all out,

56:26.731 --> 56:29.342
and it's-- it's freezing.
Oh, my God, I can't believe
there's service.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.779
I called for help.
Someone's comin' to get you.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.955
Oh, my God!
Thank God.

56:33.999 --> 56:36.393
Guys! Guys,
Jace is on the phone!

56:36.436 --> 56:37.568
I'm cold.

56:39.483 --> 56:41.441
- What did you just say?
- I'm cold.

56:46.098 --> 56:47.491
Jace, wait, one second!

56:52.800 --> 56:54.498
What's wrong?

56:54.541 --> 56:55.977
- Oh.
- What?

56:56.021 --> 56:57.762
Uh, Jace--
Jace is on the phone.

56:59.198 --> 57:03.724
It's... it's impossible,
there's-there's no service.

57:03.768 --> 57:05.857
No, I was just talking to him.
The call must have dropped.

57:05.900 --> 57:09.251
Eden, your phone's dead.

57:11.776 --> 57:12.951
It's...

57:15.649 --> 57:19.044
Oh, I don't like this feeling.
Like I'm--

57:19.087 --> 57:20.524
- It's okay.
- Like I'm foggy.

57:20.567 --> 57:24.092
Come on, Eden.
You're a medical professional,

57:24.136 --> 57:26.573
- trained to deal
with high-stress situations...
- Come on.

57:26.617 --> 57:29.489
...with a smile
and without losing
your damn mind.

57:31.317 --> 57:33.188
Come on, okay?

57:33.232 --> 57:36.104
We can't leave River
down there with Em alone,
all right?

57:36.148 --> 57:37.802
Come on.

57:49.988 --> 57:52.730
Thanks for sharing
the wealth, dick.

57:52.773 --> 57:54.775
I said I was sorry.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.258
We shouldn't let her stay
like that for long.

57:59.301 --> 58:01.086
He's gonna start
to smell soon.

58:02.435 --> 58:04.437
Maybe not in this cold.

58:08.441 --> 58:10.443
Andy was one
of my best friends.

58:14.491 --> 58:17.929
- I didn't mean to.
- Hey, hey, I know that.

58:17.972 --> 58:19.974
Em does, too.

58:23.021 --> 58:24.718
- I have to go for help.

58:27.765 --> 58:30.332
You-you mean on foot?

58:30.376 --> 58:32.421
Kit, you'll freeze
out there.

58:33.597 --> 58:35.512
You guys,
what other choice
do we have?

58:37.165 --> 58:38.732
Okay? Andy's dead.

58:40.734 --> 58:44.303
Em, she's--
she's really hurt
and she's lost it.

58:48.307 --> 58:50.439
And River,
um, no offense,

58:50.483 --> 58:54.052
but... you're
kind of a wild card, too.

59:45.799 --> 59:48.106
I swear,
something grabbed me.

59:48.149 --> 59:49.237
Okay.

59:51.065 --> 59:52.240
Be careful, please.

1:00:02.686 --> 1:00:05.645
- Kit, there's nothing there.
- I saw it.

1:00:05.689 --> 1:00:08.126
I know.
I know the feeling.

1:00:19.703 --> 1:00:21.356
Are you sure about this?

1:00:22.662 --> 1:00:25.709
Yeah, I'm sure.

1:00:27.145 --> 1:00:29.277
I've lost enough people, Kit.

1:00:29.321 --> 1:00:30.583
Maybe it's not a good idea.

1:00:34.152 --> 1:00:36.676
You know how I'm always,
like, joking around?

1:00:39.723 --> 1:00:42.682
But the truth is,
I am scared
as shit right now.

1:00:45.293 --> 1:00:48.079
But that doesn't change
the fact that I know
I have to try.

1:00:50.603 --> 1:00:51.822
Good luck.

1:01:29.163 --> 1:01:32.514
I don't think she'll come
after you again. Okay?

1:01:34.255 --> 1:01:36.431
I'm not even sure
if she'll make it
through the night.

1:01:47.051 --> 1:01:49.357
The bandage isn't working.

1:02:00.978 --> 1:02:02.980
It won't stop bleeding.

1:02:09.073 --> 1:02:11.075
I can't stop the shivering.

1:02:24.828 --> 1:02:27.656
Maybe there's
just a little juice left
in the car.

1:02:30.311 --> 1:02:32.531
Okay? Just enough
to turn the heater on.

1:02:35.926 --> 1:02:37.014
Just a little bit.

1:03:30.545 --> 1:03:34.680
Oh, yes.

1:03:34.723 --> 1:03:36.247
Oh.

1:03:36.290 --> 1:03:37.204
Oh. Yeah.

1:03:37.248 --> 1:03:39.337
Oh, my God, baby.

1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:40.904
Baby, it's working.

1:03:41.948 --> 1:03:43.689
- You were right.
- It worked.

1:03:52.089 --> 1:03:54.526
Oh, it feels so good.

1:03:56.920 --> 1:03:58.878
I love you, baby.

1:04:01.141 --> 1:04:02.577
I love you, too.

1:04:29.996 --> 1:04:32.433
Thank God, the pipes
haven't frozen over yet.

1:04:34.522 --> 1:04:35.872
Well...

1:04:39.919 --> 1:04:42.443
- Good news.
- Hmm?

1:04:42.487 --> 1:04:44.576
I'm willing to part
with my mother's antiques.

1:04:44.619 --> 1:04:46.970
Hmm, personal growth.
I'm all for it.

1:04:52.758 --> 1:04:54.020
What?

1:04:56.718 --> 1:04:58.329
Hey, where's Em?

1:05:02.942 --> 1:05:05.249
- Em?

1:05:07.381 --> 1:05:09.775
- Em?
- What's that sound?

1:05:12.473 --> 1:05:15.302
Oh, my God.
Is she in the car?

1:05:24.398 --> 1:05:25.922
Em...

1:05:28.446 --> 1:05:31.797
Em, wake up.

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:33.190
Eden.

1:06:08.747 --> 1:06:10.357
You sure you wanna come?

1:06:11.837 --> 1:06:13.534
Yeah, I'm worried
about Kit, too.

1:06:14.753 --> 1:06:17.843
Plus, I can't
let you go alone.

1:06:19.192 --> 1:06:20.367
Okay.

1:06:58.405 --> 1:06:59.450
Kit.

1:07:01.843 --> 1:07:04.063
- Is he--
- No.

1:07:21.950 --> 1:07:23.909
Why did he do that?

1:07:27.173 --> 1:07:29.741
It's, um...
It's called something...

1:07:29.784 --> 1:07:33.397
Um, paradoxical undressing.

1:07:35.790 --> 1:07:37.009
I remember it
being really common

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:39.272
in people dying
from hypothermia.

1:07:41.318 --> 1:07:44.060
They strip off
all their clothes,
like they're burning up.

1:08:06.778 --> 1:08:08.910
But in actuality,
they're freezing.

1:08:35.546 --> 1:08:36.938
What now?

1:08:38.940 --> 1:08:43.336
We get the fire going again,
finish off your snacks,
and then...

1:08:45.947 --> 1:08:47.906
I mean, this is
all we have left.

1:08:51.039 --> 1:08:52.345
You have it.

1:08:53.346 --> 1:08:55.348
Hey, we can share.

1:09:03.182 --> 1:09:04.792
Why are you
so good to me?

1:09:06.229 --> 1:09:07.839
You know why.

1:09:09.928 --> 1:09:12.191
Because we're friends?

1:09:16.282 --> 1:09:19.938
Yeah. Friends.

1:09:25.465 --> 1:09:29.077
Hey, that looks like a good
firewood candidate.

1:09:29.121 --> 1:09:31.079
Yeah. Yeah.

1:09:31.123 --> 1:09:33.778
At least, we'll be warm
when we starve to death.

1:09:33.821 --> 1:09:36.824
Hey, no one's
starving to death.

1:09:40.219 --> 1:09:42.265
- I'll go get the axe.
- Hmm.

1:10:14.645 --> 1:10:16.168
River...

1:10:21.042 --> 1:10:24.307
Come here.

1:10:26.178 --> 1:10:30.269
What are you doing?
You're gonna freeze.

1:10:30.313 --> 1:10:31.618
Come on.

1:10:44.109 --> 1:10:45.241
Hurry.

1:11:07.567 --> 1:11:09.569
Doesn't a hot shower
sound nice?

1:12:00.707 --> 1:12:02.187
River?

1:12:20.597 --> 1:12:22.294
River!

1:12:42.488 --> 1:12:44.142
Oh, River!

1:12:46.405 --> 1:12:49.190
Oh, my God, River!
What are you thinking?!

1:12:51.018 --> 1:12:53.151
What-- what are you doing?

1:12:59.592 --> 1:13:01.899
I-- I-- I--

1:13:01.942 --> 1:13:06.033
I wish-- I wish--
we could have t-- tried...

1:13:09.602 --> 1:13:11.909
Hang in there.
Hang in there, River.

1:13:11.952 --> 1:13:13.998
You're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be okay.

1:13:14.041 --> 1:13:15.913
I wanna s-sleep.

1:13:15.956 --> 1:13:17.175
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

1:13:17.218 --> 1:13:18.437
you're not gonna do that
right now.

1:13:18.481 --> 1:13:20.178
Keep your eyes open, okay?
I'm-- I'm here.

1:13:20.221 --> 1:13:21.527
I'm gonna warm you up, okay?

1:13:21.571 --> 1:13:23.137
- Don't worry.

1:13:24.791 --> 1:13:26.445
You're gonna be fine.

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:31.494
You-- you have to--
to survive.

1:13:31.537 --> 1:13:34.975
No, no, please,
River, don't say that.

1:13:35.019 --> 1:13:36.760
River, please.

1:13:36.803 --> 1:13:39.240
No, no.

1:13:45.072 --> 1:13:47.423
River, please.
Please, wake up.

1:14:16.539 --> 1:14:19.890
River, the power's back.
The power's back.

1:14:19.933 --> 1:14:21.152
We're gonna be okay.

1:14:22.153 --> 1:14:23.154
We're gonna be okay.

1:14:34.948 --> 1:14:36.210
Sit here.

1:14:39.257 --> 1:14:42.565
Sit right here
and wait for help.

1:14:42.608 --> 1:14:44.044
We made it.

1:14:45.350 --> 1:14:46.960
Happy New Year.

1:15:00.017 --> 1:15:02.846
I've arrived on the property.
Yes, I already see
a young woman.

1:15:02.889 --> 1:15:04.935
- Alive.

1:15:08.852 --> 1:15:11.158
Ma'am, are there
any other survivors?

1:15:11.202 --> 1:15:13.073
Just us.

1:15:13.117 --> 1:15:14.553
Us?

1:15:16.294 --> 1:15:17.513
Yeah.

1:15:19.384 --> 1:15:20.951
Me and River.
