WEBVTT

03:13.652 --> 03:15.529
I don't understand.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.244
We have to wait.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.248
No, we go back in now.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.543
We, uh, we get a SWAT team,

03:30.544 --> 03:31.920
and we get a tank,
and we go back in there--

03:31.921 --> 03:33.338
You broke into a facility--

03:33.339 --> 03:35.757
- We didn't break in--
- You broke into a facility

03:35.758 --> 03:37.300
<i>without a warrant.</i>

03:37.301 --> 03:39.886
- I can't in good conscience--
- Zimmerfield is dead.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.721
I know, and I'm sorry.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.556
- No, we're going back now--
- No, we're not--

03:43.557 --> 03:44.849
- Yes, we are--
- No, we're not--

03:44.850 --> 03:46.727
- Yes, we are!
- No, we're not!

03:49.313 --> 03:51.564
All we have at this point
is a dead cop

03:51.565 --> 03:54.859
as a result of an unlawful B&E.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.070
He was shot...

03:57.071 --> 03:58.906
with a harpoon.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.411
We can't just start a gunfight

04:05.412 --> 04:07.915
in the middle of the Seattle Zoo.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.259
You're in on this.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.176
What?

04:20.177 --> 04:22.887
No follow-up on Patrick Spring,

04:22.888 --> 04:25.223
now you've got a dead cop,

04:25.224 --> 04:27.767
and you're saying
we gotta do this by the book?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.019
Yeah, you're in on this.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.646
Say it.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.856
Say it to my face.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.192
Say, "I'm in on this."

04:35.943 --> 04:39.988
Estevez, you are saying things
you're going to regret--

04:39.989 --> 04:43.157
Say it!

04:43.158 --> 04:44.493
Say "I'm one of them."

04:45.703 --> 04:47.704
- "Them?"
- Yes, them.

04:47.705 --> 04:48.663
The Patrick Spring "them."

04:48.664 --> 04:50.331
Those bald freaks, "them."

04:50.332 --> 04:52.041
The Coroner,
the-the Gordon Rimmer,

04:52.042 --> 04:54.085
and whatever the hell else
is locked up in that damn...

04:54.086 --> 04:56.087
Animal Transfer Unit, "them"!

04:56.088 --> 04:57.505
Them!

04:57.506 --> 04:58.507
You're suspended.

04:59.425 --> 05:01.175
- Say it.
- You're fired.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.344
Say it.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.348
Bradshaw, come and escort
Detective Estevez--

05:07.349 --> 05:08.517
No, no, no.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.854
Say it.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.188
- I'm right here, just you and me.
- I'm right here...

05:14.189 --> 05:15.566
Just say it. Say it!

05:18.861 --> 05:20.903
A cop is dead.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.281
Zimmerfield is dead,

05:23.282 --> 05:25.075
and he's firing me.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.038
It's not over.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.166
Not by a long shot.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.711
Make sure he leaves.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.055
Rimmer, we have a problem.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.521
Okay, I'll get Farah.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.064
No.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.650
I'll go with Farah,
you stay and talk to Amanda.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.110
Now?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.570
Everything is connected, Todd.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.907
Telling Amanda the truth
is your next step.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.077
Is this, you know, a universe thing?

06:09.078 --> 06:12.330
Like, if I don't do this now,
the universe goes all weird?

06:12.331 --> 06:14.248
The universe
is already weird, Todd.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.666
If you don't tell her now,

06:15.667 --> 06:18.962
and we get... killed later...

06:20.214 --> 06:22.673
I'll go with Farah and take the machine
back to the Spring Mansion,

06:22.674 --> 06:23.925
and figure out
what the hell it does.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.052
Oh! And you should bring Amanda.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.512
She isn't safe here.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.639
Okay.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.392
- You're back, thank God--
- Farah!

06:32.393 --> 06:33.726
Hey, listen,
we got the machine--

06:33.727 --> 06:36.145
- I killed someone--
- It's okay, we killed some people, too--

06:36.146 --> 06:37.939
Wait, what? It-it... you what?

06:37.940 --> 06:39.190
Is Amanda okay?

06:39.191 --> 06:40.942
- Yes, she's--
- Are you okay?

06:40.943 --> 06:43.319
Have you ever...
done anything like that before?

06:43.320 --> 06:45.947
No. A lot of training, but---

06:45.948 --> 06:47.782
Wait. What machine?

06:47.783 --> 06:50.034
We found Edgar Spring's
unlimited energy device.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.954
- We think. Who did you kill?
- It's more of those bald freaks.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.373
I found their hideout,
they attacked the police,

06:55.374 --> 06:57.875
they killed that detective!

06:57.876 --> 06:59.210
Estevez or Zimmerfield?

06:59.211 --> 07:00.294
Zimmerfield.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.171
Jesus, this is out of control.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.548
Wait, wait, who did you kill?

07:03.549 --> 07:04.674
Same guys, same team,

07:04.675 --> 07:06.300
they must've tracked us
out to the reservation,

07:06.301 --> 07:07.885
but we got them with the kitten.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.137
- The what?
- The kitten.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.680
- It had a shark in it.
- Okay...

07:10.681 --> 07:12.849
And just putting this out there,

07:12.850 --> 07:14.308
this is just a theory at this point,

07:14.309 --> 07:17.728
but we think the dog
has Lydia Spring in it.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.980
What?

07:18.981 --> 07:21.190
We think Rimmer swapped
the soul of the dog and Lydia

07:21.191 --> 07:22.442
to use as insurance

07:22.443 --> 07:24.068
in case Patrick Spring
tried to screw him

07:24.069 --> 07:26.155
in the hostage exchange
for the machine.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.245
So Lydia's in the dog?

07:34.246 --> 07:35.413
Yes.

07:35.414 --> 07:39.333
But we can put her
back in her body, right?

07:39.334 --> 07:41.127
Dirk can do a... thing?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.004
Well, if we get the dog, and Lydia,

07:43.005 --> 07:45.590
and whatever they used
to swap the soul, then...

07:45.591 --> 07:47.383
yes, we're...

07:47.384 --> 07:48.760
we're optimistic about that.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.678
Okay.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.512
Hmm.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.014
Amanda said

07:53.015 --> 07:55.391
she was approached by men
who seemed military.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.059
- Shit, that's "Black Wing."
- What?!

07:57.060 --> 07:59.812
"Black Wing," it's a defunct
CIA program that's after Dirk.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.689
Listen, there's a tremendous
amount of moving pieces here.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.107
We can't pin them all down now.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.234
Okay. Sure.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.028
You need to get Dirk
to the Spring Mansion, yeah?

08:07.029 --> 08:08.946
I'll get Amanda
and meet you there,

08:08.947 --> 08:10.281
but I have something
I have to do here first.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.366
Dirk's outside.
Can you drive him?

08:12.367 --> 08:14.911
He's not good at... cars.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.330
Yes. Take my SUV.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.248
Farah, thank you.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.375
I just want Lydia safe.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.252
That's all that matters now.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.296
Well, we're gonna make that happen.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.591
Or something like that, definitely.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.760
Thanks, Todd.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.054
Are-are you armed, and whatever?

08:33.055 --> 08:34.722
Always. Are you?

08:34.723 --> 08:36.182
What? No.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.893
<i>- Wait, what are you--</i>
- Don't let anyone see you have this

08:38.894 --> 08:40.604
until you punch them
in the face with it.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.105
Right, okay.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.066
I'd give you my gun,
but then I wouldn't have one.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.567
That can never happen.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.653
Right.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.951
Amanda?

08:55.911 --> 08:56.912
Are you here?

09:13.303 --> 09:14.554
Dude...

09:14.555 --> 09:16.473
shit has been going down.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.766
Where were you?

09:18.767 --> 09:21.102
What did you find out there,
with the-the map?

09:21.103 --> 09:22.270
Hey. We, um--

09:22.271 --> 09:25.439
Farah is super weird.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.482
You were right,

09:26.483 --> 09:28.734
I think you have way more
of a shot with her than I thought--

09:28.735 --> 09:30.278
- We have to--
- I spent all night with her,

09:30.279 --> 09:32.863
and she is, like, this
mega whackado basket case--

09:32.864 --> 09:34.657
- Amanda, we have to--
- Not that she's not great,

09:34.658 --> 09:36.576
but, oh, I don't even know
where to start--

09:36.577 --> 09:37.952
I never had pararibulitus.

09:37.953 --> 09:40.163
--the last 24 hours is just like...

09:42.624 --> 09:43.709
What?

09:44.126 --> 09:46.002
Th-this isn't
how I wanted to tell you.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.336
I just...

09:47.337 --> 09:49.298
I couldn't keep it a secret anymore.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.800
What did you say?

09:54.303 --> 09:56.263
I never had pararibulitus.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.144
Yes, you did. What are you...

10:03.145 --> 10:05.229
What are talking about?
Yes, you did.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.815
That's, like,
why you dropped out of college--

10:07.816 --> 10:10.401
No, I-I dropped out
because I was failing,

10:10.402 --> 10:12.028
because I never went to classes,

10:12.029 --> 10:16.324
because I was trying to dedicate my time
to The Mexican Funeral.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.325
Look, th-this isn't

10:17.326 --> 10:19.160
how I meant for this
to happen, okay?

10:19.161 --> 10:21.412
I've wanted to tell you for years, but--

10:21.413 --> 10:22.496
That doesn't make sense.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.041
The Mexican Funeral broke up

10:25.042 --> 10:27.376
because of your pararibulitus.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.837
The Mexican Funeral broke up
because I sold our equipment,

10:29.838 --> 10:32.007
and told the guys that it was stolen.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.011
Okay.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.513
But, okay, but there was
that time with mom and dad

10:39.514 --> 10:40.681
when you were, like--

10:40.682 --> 10:42.516
Well, I wanted my own apartment,

10:42.517 --> 10:44.185
and I needed first
and last months' rent,

10:44.186 --> 10:45.561
and the money
mom and dad were sending

10:45.562 --> 10:48.856
for what they thought was my treatments
wasn't enough, so...

10:48.857 --> 10:50.524
I thought,
the band wasn't going anywhere,

10:50.525 --> 10:51.942
so, screw them,

10:51.943 --> 10:53.861
and then I told mom and dad

10:53.862 --> 10:55.946
that they were all just
trying to screw me over--

10:55.947 --> 10:57.240
You told me that.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.743
Yes, I told you that,

11:00.744 --> 11:03.954
and I-I told them that
my parents hated them.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.082
When you're lying,
you lie to both sides,

11:06.083 --> 11:07.917
so that the others
don't talk to each other,

11:07.918 --> 11:11.253
and I-I ended up
trapped under so many,

11:11.254 --> 11:13.714
- 'cause it-it snowballed--
- It "snowballed"?

11:13.715 --> 11:15.299
I was being stupid.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.550
You're not like that.

11:16.551 --> 11:17.551
You wouldn't do that--

11:17.552 --> 11:18.761
- No--
- And you are not like that--

11:18.762 --> 11:20.137
No, I'm not.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.472
I-I changed.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.265
I changed the second you got sick.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.851
It made me realize that I-I...

11:27.729 --> 11:29.397
I-it doesn't matter now, okay?

11:29.398 --> 11:30.481
Because...

11:30.482 --> 11:32.025
because look...

11:33.694 --> 11:34.610
Seriously?

11:34.611 --> 11:35.904
It's $10,000.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.950
You're trying to bribe me?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.451
No, I--

11:42.452 --> 11:44.621
Look, we can talk about this later.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.414
This isn't happening...

11:46.415 --> 11:47.915
Oh, this was stupid.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.583
- This was so stupid of me--
- Yes. Uh-huh.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.919
- Okay, we have to leave now--
- Is that a joke?

11:51.920 --> 11:53.337
- No, we have to go--
- No, what are you--!

11:53.338 --> 11:54.964
What are you saying to me?

11:54.965 --> 11:56.925
- What are you even saying?
- Amanda--

11:58.677 --> 12:01.512
This isn't happening.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.181
I'm sorry, Todd, but this is not...

12:04.182 --> 12:05.266
happening.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.601
- Wait--
- Not...

12:07.602 --> 12:09.646
- happening.
- No-- Amanda...

12:22.451 --> 12:24.076
What are you doing?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.077
Spot checks.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.538
Whoever was following you
could be watching us now.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.749
"Spot checks." Fantastic.

12:29.750 --> 12:30.833
I think of you and me

12:30.834 --> 12:33.419
as Module "B"
of the detective agency.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.838
Todd and I being Module "A,"
the investigative arm,

12:35.839 --> 12:37.840
but you and I,
we're the strike team,

12:37.841 --> 12:39.217
for when things get physical.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.512
You can't be in both
Module "A" and Module "B."

12:43.513 --> 12:45.056
Sure I can, I jump across.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.391
Your...

12:47.392 --> 12:48.934
organizational structure

12:48.935 --> 12:50.019
is confusing.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.562
What you'd want to do is

12:51.563 --> 12:54.523
use the MECE methodology
to divide the teams.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.400
The meece... what?

12:56.401 --> 12:59.361
Mutually Exclusive,
Cumulatively Exhaustive

12:59.362 --> 13:00.362
sub-units,

13:00.363 --> 13:04.408
And then establish configurations
wherein every possible dynamic

13:04.409 --> 13:06.869
is addressed to the skill set
of the people therein.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.455
<i>That would be more efficient.</i>

13:11.875 --> 13:15.544
I'm not...
part of your detective agency--

13:15.545 --> 13:17.213
Aren't you, though, a little bit?

13:17.214 --> 13:18.422
I mean, what else have you got?

13:18.423 --> 13:21.133
I mainly attract people
in positions of absolute hopelessness,

13:21.134 --> 13:23.053
so I think you
fit into that quite nicely.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.805
No offense.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.642
Just... be quiet.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.770
But it's kind of incredible, isn't it?

13:32.771 --> 13:34.396
I mean, how close we are now?

13:34.397 --> 13:36.398
It really feels like
we're onto something.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.234
- We'll see.
- Did I make some mistakes?

13:38.235 --> 13:39.068
Yes.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.653
Did I <i>only</i> make mistakes?

13:40.654 --> 13:41.737
Yes.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.780
But did it all work out?

13:42.781 --> 13:44.073
Kind of!

13:44.074 --> 13:46.742
I had a plan,
and I put it into action,

13:46.743 --> 13:48.744
and it went off flawlessly.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.579
Almost. Mostly.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.122
Maybe it went off flawful-ish.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.916
But not a total disaster.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.086
In fact, an unmitigated not-total-disaster

13:57.087 --> 13:59.255
of the sort I'm thrilled
to be involved in.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.840
That's what we'll put on the sign

14:00.841 --> 14:02.424
for the detective agency, Farah.

14:02.425 --> 14:06.428
"Cases Solved
With Arguable Efficiency."

14:06.429 --> 14:10.933
Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency!

14:10.934 --> 14:12.893
Dirk Gently, here to help.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.353
You hear that, everyone!

14:14.354 --> 14:15.312
Dirk Gently!

14:15.313 --> 14:16.856
Me! Dirk Gently!

14:16.857 --> 14:18.607
- That's what the sign will say!
- Shh! Shh...

14:18.608 --> 14:19.942
I am Dirk Gently!

14:19.943 --> 14:22.152
- I am Dirk Gently!
- Dirk, get down--

14:22.153 --> 14:24.114
- Dirk! Get down!

14:27.951 --> 14:29.369
No, don't!

14:36.877 --> 14:38.962
Get out of the way.
Dammit.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.798
Run! Run, run...

14:56.646 --> 14:58.314
Run!
Gun coming!

15:11.286 --> 15:12.329
Stop!

15:22.589 --> 15:25.090
Drop your weapon!
Drop it now!

15:36.853 --> 15:39.189
Oh, why?

15:41.149 --> 15:42.274
Stop running!

15:42.275 --> 15:43.359
Not much choice!

15:44.402 --> 15:45.277
No, no, stop, please!

15:45.278 --> 15:47.237
Please, I don't know
why you're doing this!

15:47.238 --> 15:50.574
You're supposed to die!
I'm supposed to kill you!

15:50.575 --> 15:52.117
Everything led me here!

15:52.118 --> 15:54.078
To you! To this!

15:54.079 --> 15:55.914
- Everything is connected--
- Everything is connected--

16:00.085 --> 16:01.460
That's...

16:01.461 --> 16:03.129
different.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.598
You're one of the others...

16:14.599 --> 16:17.143
You're like me!

16:18.478 --> 16:21.063
You're not like me.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.316
You're something different.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.317
You...

16:25.318 --> 16:26.319
Dirk!

16:49.509 --> 16:50.968
Are you okay?

16:50.969 --> 16:53.346
Emotionally? Certainly not.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.774
I can't get hurt, it isn't possible--

17:05.775 --> 17:07.568
You've never been hurt before?

17:07.569 --> 17:09.111
It isn't possible...

17:09.112 --> 17:11.321
Cops are coming, and we need
to find a way out of here.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.243
All right, all right,
if we can just get to the service level,

17:16.244 --> 17:18.328
maybe we can get out the back.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.621
I'll never walk again!

17:19.622 --> 17:21.833
And of course that's locked
for employees only.

17:23.752 --> 17:24.626
And I have no tools.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.798
Farah, that was unbelievable.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.300
You saved me.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.302
No wonder Spring
entrusted his safety to you.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.971
You are an incredible person.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.806
Who'd have thought?

17:37.807 --> 17:38.974
All part of the job.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.642
No, it absolutely wasn't.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.643
Unless you're talking

17:41.644 --> 17:43.812
about your job
at my detective agency.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.483
The machine!
I left it in the car!

17:47.484 --> 17:48.650
Stupid Dirk!

17:48.651 --> 17:50.819
Always running away from death
and forgetting machines!

17:52.655 --> 17:55.157
I got it!

17:55.158 --> 17:57.076
I got it!

17:57.077 --> 17:58.494
I got it.
We're moving again.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.205
- I messed up.
- What?

18:01.206 --> 18:02.247
I ruined everything,

18:02.248 --> 18:03.458
What are you talking about?

18:04.834 --> 18:09.004
I left my path,
and this is my punishment.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.507
I'm lost.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.719
The universe is broken.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.934
Oh, thank God.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.269
<i>We have to get this
to the Spring Mansion.</i>

18:24.270 --> 18:26.939
The FBI guy was right,
we can't do this alone.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.274
I--

18:42.497 --> 18:43.872
You were right.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.542
I need your help.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.170
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.266
I have a theory.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.269
I have a theory,
and I don't like it at all,

19:05.270 --> 19:06.604
but it's...

19:07.814 --> 19:11.233
it's my theory right now,
and right now that's all I got.

19:11.234 --> 19:14.111
So, uh...

19:14.112 --> 19:17.281
I'm gonna explain it to you, and...

19:17.282 --> 19:18.824
if you understand it,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.409
I mean, if you follow it
all the way through,

19:20.410 --> 19:21.577
you gotta tell me,
you gotta help me,

19:21.578 --> 19:23.579
and you gotta confirm or deny
whether it's accurate,

19:23.580 --> 19:24.789
'cause...

19:26.583 --> 19:29.084
right now I feel like
I'm losing my mind a little.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.086
Like, uh...

19:31.087 --> 19:33.422
like I might...

19:33.423 --> 19:35.257
like I might be having
some mental problems.

19:36.634 --> 19:37.969
You know?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.931
So, I just, uh...

19:44.100 --> 19:48.020
I need you to confirm or deny one...

19:48.021 --> 19:49.939
one question.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.614
Are you Lydia Spring?

20:00.158 --> 20:01.783
No.
I've been through a lot, right?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.161
And-and-and I lost someone who I...

20:04.162 --> 20:05.370
Who I...

20:05.371 --> 20:08.790
I lost someone who means a lot to me.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.959
And I'm... I am...

20:10.960 --> 20:12.295
I'm not...

20:14.839 --> 20:17.049
Bark twice for "yes."
Are you Lydia Spring?

20:18.593 --> 20:20.385
Mm...

20:20.386 --> 20:22.639
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.143
If you're Lydia Spring,

20:28.144 --> 20:29.978
bark three times
and turn in a circle.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.364
I'm going to need a minute.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.699
Oh...

20:44.077 --> 20:45.702
How did this happen?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.037
Huh?

20:47.038 --> 20:48.747
Did Gordon Rimmer do this?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.250
How did you get away?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.086
Did someone take you?

20:54.879 --> 20:56.964
Was it Dirk Gently
and Todd Brotzman?

21:03.221 --> 21:04.221
Let's go talk to them.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.444
These guys suck.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.074
I said these guys suck!

21:32.750 --> 21:34.751
- Hey, you grabbed my ass.
- What?

21:34.752 --> 21:36.879
- You just grabbed my ass--
- I'm Rick.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.257
- What the hell?
- That's my boyfriend!

21:40.258 --> 21:42.342
He just grabbed my ass,
you stupid bitch!

21:42.343 --> 21:43.927
He can do whatever he wants--

21:43.928 --> 21:45.595
- You wanna go?
- Yeah!

21:45.596 --> 21:48.765
- Let's take this outside!
- Hey!

21:48.766 --> 21:51.602
Both of you, out of here, now!

21:52.437 --> 21:54.271
Holy shit!

21:54.272 --> 21:55.440
Are you all right?

21:56.524 --> 21:59.526
I'm sorry,
I screwed up your night,

21:59.527 --> 22:00.777
your one night out.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.113
No, it's okay,
that guy was an asshole.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.824
I know you never go out anymore
because of the disease,

22:05.825 --> 22:07.451
and now I'm...

22:07.452 --> 22:09.286
I'm covered in beer,

22:09.287 --> 22:11.038
and I'm crying
like a pussy, and...

22:11.039 --> 22:11.998
Hey.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.793
See? It's great.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.961
I love you.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.464
I love you, too.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.977
Are you ready to talk?

22:33.978 --> 22:36.813
I'm sorry.

22:36.814 --> 22:40.150
Is this very inconvenient for you?

22:40.151 --> 22:41.652
I'm processing.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.364
I just...

22:45.365 --> 22:48.033
God, I really messed this up.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.159
I should've waited.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.994
<i>You should've waited?</i>

22:50.995 --> 22:52.496
<i>Yeah, you're right,</i>

22:52.497 --> 22:54.832
<i>six years wasn't
quite long enough.</i>

22:56.584 --> 23:01.338
Great prank, Todd,
but you screwed up the timing.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.466
That's what you screwed up.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.677
<i>Put your phone under the door.</i>

23:07.678 --> 23:09.012
What?

23:09.013 --> 23:10.723
<i>I'm calling mom and dad.</i>

23:15.686 --> 23:18.271
Okay, okay, but, Amanda,

23:18.272 --> 23:19.731
we have to go meet
Dirk and Farah.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.191
And we can't stay here anymore.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.275
There are dangerous people--

23:22.276 --> 23:24.277
Yeah, I know,

23:24.278 --> 23:25.696
I met some of them.

23:27.698 --> 23:31.076
Look, you're the most important
person in the world to me.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.079
What are you even saying?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.247
I don't know you.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.750
I literally don't know who you are.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.878
<i>You are not my brother,</i>

23:41.879 --> 23:45.757
<i>you are... some other person.</i>

23:45.758 --> 23:47.593
No, I am your brother.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.099
Give me the goddamn phone,

23:54.100 --> 23:55.059
right now.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.232
Oh, shit.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.238
Oh, my God.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.074
You recognize this dog?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.075
Huh?

24:12.076 --> 24:13.076
Yes.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.078
This is the dog you stole
from Gordon Rimmer,

24:15.079 --> 24:17.080
right before
you burned down his house.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.582
<i>Right?</i>

24:18.583 --> 24:19.833
<i>That's what happened, yes.</i>

24:21.752 --> 24:24.588
I would've thought you would have
cleaned this shithole up by now.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.256
You know the CIA--

24:26.257 --> 24:28.091
the actual goddamn CIA--
told us not to follow up

24:28.092 --> 24:30.469
on those four guys
in the van who trashed it?

24:30.470 --> 24:31.928
Crazy.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.433
Have you...
have you been drinking?

24:36.434 --> 24:37.476
Have you been drinking?

24:37.477 --> 24:38.810
Okay.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.981
That dog... is the most
important thing here.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.775
Because it's Lydia Spring.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.776
Yes.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.279
How did they turn her into a dog?

24:49.280 --> 24:51.448
Oh, they-they didn't,

24:51.449 --> 24:54.826
they took the soul out of her body
and swapped it with a dog.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.077
Her body?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.496
Yeah, she-- she's still alive.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.955
Oh, so you know where she is?

24:58.956 --> 25:00.124
I-I...

25:03.794 --> 25:05.462
Your friends killed my partner.

25:05.463 --> 25:07.130
They are not my friends.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.465
Oh, so you know about that, too, huh?

25:08.466 --> 25:09.549
No! I...

25:09.550 --> 25:11.384
Where...

25:11.385 --> 25:13.470
is Lydia Spring?

25:19.352 --> 25:20.644
I need to open that door.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.187
Is that Dirk Gently in there?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.315
Let me open that door.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.566
You don't have a warrant.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.485
I have a gun, Todd.

25:28.486 --> 25:29.486
I have a gun.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.824
You-you seem...

25:34.825 --> 25:37.744
a little stressed,
I'm just gonna say it--

25:37.745 --> 25:39.579
- Ow!
- Stay on the ground!

25:39.580 --> 25:41.456
I will not let this
get ahead of me again!

25:41.457 --> 25:43.500
- You understand me!
- You have to open that door!

25:43.501 --> 25:45.377
- Shut up!
- My sister is in there!

25:45.378 --> 25:46.503
Come out with your hands up!

25:46.504 --> 25:48.046
- Please--
- Shut up!

25:48.047 --> 25:48.922
She has a disease!

25:48.923 --> 25:50.590
Shut up!

25:50.591 --> 25:51.841
Amanda!
Are you okay?

25:54.762 --> 25:55.762
<i>Clear the door, I'm coming in.</i>

26:01.060 --> 26:03.353
Okay. Okay...
All right, come on.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.021
Why is she choking? Huh?

26:05.022 --> 26:06.690
<i>What the hell's wrong with her?</i>

26:06.691 --> 26:09.192
She's not choking, she's drowning.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.657
- We have to get her to a hospital.
- No, no, no, there isn't any time.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.118
She keeps breathing like this,
she'll hemorrhage her lungs.

26:18.119 --> 26:21.204
Amanda!

26:21.205 --> 26:22.581
Holy shit.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.249
Jesus, not now.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.793
You are coming with us.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.923
<i>Not these guys again!</i>

26:31.924 --> 26:33.216
<i>Lydia, with me!</i>

26:33.217 --> 26:34.134
<i>Shit!</i>

26:36.387 --> 26:37.221
I'm all revved up.

26:38.389 --> 26:39.723
Ed, are we in trouble?

26:39.724 --> 26:41.266
I will handle this, Zed.

26:51.485 --> 26:52.778
Jesus...

27:00.077 --> 27:00.995
Hi! How ya doin'?

27:02.413 --> 27:03.414
Goodnight!

27:04.582 --> 27:06.416
Take that!

27:06.417 --> 27:07.417
I got him!

27:32.610 --> 27:34.611
Amanda, thank God.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.279
Don't touch me!

27:36.280 --> 27:37.448
Amanda...

27:38.532 --> 27:40.033
No.

27:40.034 --> 27:42.661
You brought me here
to keep me safe?

27:42.662 --> 27:44.120
Here?

27:44.121 --> 27:45.288
Into this.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.456
With you.

27:46.457 --> 27:49.459
You don't care about me at all.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.961
That's not true.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.633
Okay, just... look.

27:56.634 --> 27:57.634
I was gonna fix things.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.303
I was going to fix everything.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.308
Everything about you is a lie.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.227
<i>I don't want your help,</i>

28:07.228 --> 28:13.483
and I... I don't want
to ever see you again.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.485
You are exactly...

28:15.486 --> 28:17.488
the piece of shit
that everyone thinks you are.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.497
Get me out of here.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.999
No, wait, Amanda!

28:30.000 --> 28:31.335
You-you can't leave!

28:32.503 --> 28:34.087
Amanda, stop!

28:34.088 --> 28:35.840
You can't go with them!

28:37.842 --> 28:40.218
Don't be sad.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.389
...Traffic conditions,

28:44.390 --> 28:45.890
transporting the machine,

28:45.891 --> 28:47.100
accosted by a...

28:47.101 --> 28:52.230
So, you're saying
you have no idea who that was?

28:52.231 --> 28:54.315
Okay, now,
I can't clarify this enough,

28:54.316 --> 28:56.401
I haven't the slightest clue.

28:56.402 --> 29:00.071
That homicidal dirt muppet and I
have never crossed paths before.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.990
Could she be with the cult?

29:01.991 --> 29:03.074
Well, I think not.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.745
I do think we had...

29:06.746 --> 29:09.414
we had a bit of a moment, though,

29:09.415 --> 29:10.415
maybe.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.416
A "moment"?

29:11.417 --> 29:12.960
I don't know.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.920
Look, I don't like this,
and Todd should be here by now.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.172
He'll be here.

29:17.173 --> 29:19.925
He wanted to talk to Amanda
about some things.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.596
Do you... like Todd?

29:24.597 --> 29:25.680
Yeah, he's fine.

29:25.681 --> 29:26.932
Is he?

29:29.602 --> 29:31.853
He's brave,

29:31.854 --> 29:34.273
in his own unique... way.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.816
I like that he's there for you.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.777
I like that he's doing this
even though he doesn't have to.

29:38.778 --> 29:39.944
Call him again.

29:39.945 --> 29:40.987
He's not much of a phone-answerer,

29:40.988 --> 29:42.156
in my experience.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.116
Once we plug in the machine,

29:45.117 --> 29:46.284
everything will become clear,

29:46.285 --> 29:47.202
I'm sure of it.

29:47.203 --> 29:50.121
You don't even know what it does.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.165
Well, I mean, clearly, it...

29:52.166 --> 29:54.793
clarifies everything?

29:54.794 --> 29:56.128
Show me.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.478
<i>Oh...</i>

30:13.479 --> 30:15.688
Does it do that?

30:15.689 --> 30:17.315
We didn't see that one.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.233
These are dates.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.401
This is the date
Patrick was killed,

30:20.402 --> 30:21.319
and this...

30:21.320 --> 30:24.823
this is when
his wife was killed.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.491
What is this thing?

30:26.492 --> 30:27.992
It's...

30:27.993 --> 30:29.536
a bad news...

30:29.537 --> 30:30.745
calendar...

30:30.746 --> 30:32.330
machine.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.415
What?

30:41.215 --> 30:43.175
You said you were bringing backup.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.678
Yes, well, it's hard
to get a SWAT team together

30:46.679 --> 30:48.847
based on one phone call.

30:48.848 --> 30:51.099
Smart move to call me, though.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.517
You're the FBI man?

30:52.518 --> 30:53.560
Yes, that's right,

30:53.561 --> 30:55.395
and you're... Dirk Gently?

30:55.396 --> 30:56.271
It's me.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.188
Good to finally meet you.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.190
You said you were attacked.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.067
Yes, so many times.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.902
There's a group of people,

31:02.903 --> 31:05.864
some kind of cult
or secret organization

31:05.865 --> 31:06.865
hunting us.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.533
<i>They said they didn't kill Patrick,</i>

31:08.534 --> 31:10.201
<i>but they have Lydia.</i>

31:10.202 --> 31:12.036
They're a key piece
in what's happening.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.454
Two of them even came after us

31:13.455 --> 31:15.123
while we were trying
to dig up the machine.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.584
- Got them both, though.
- Yeah.

31:17.918 --> 31:18.918
You killed them?

31:18.919 --> 31:20.546
Well, the shark did, certainly.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.716
This "machine," where is it?

31:24.717 --> 31:26.885
Here, right here.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.386
We put it together ourselves,

31:28.387 --> 31:30.222
so some bits might
be on backwards, but...

31:36.228 --> 31:38.104
This is it.

31:38.105 --> 31:40.815
This is... the machine.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.317
<i>That's right.</i>

31:42.318 --> 31:44.903
Excellent work, Miss Black.

31:44.904 --> 31:47.071
Thank you.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.907
Can I tell you a secret?

31:48.908 --> 31:50.618
When we met?

31:52.995 --> 31:54.913
You were right the first time.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.414
Farah!

31:56.415 --> 32:00.084
You're going
to have to come with me.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.640
This is lunacy.

32:13.641 --> 32:14.766
You must see that.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.809
Cops showed up at the temple,

32:16.810 --> 32:18.269
had to kill one of them.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.271
Should I be expecting more?

32:20.272 --> 32:22.440
You lost your mind
when you betrayed Rainey.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.776
The Supreme Soul had a plan for us,

32:24.777 --> 32:26.110
for all of us.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.154
Oh, really? Did he, now?

32:28.155 --> 32:29.948
"Find more bodies,

32:29.949 --> 32:32.659
make new drones,
make more money."

32:32.660 --> 32:35.119
There's no ambition in that.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.871
He got what he had coming to him.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.373
That's heresy.

32:40.167 --> 32:43.294
This is what blows my mind about you,

32:43.295 --> 32:45.129
you talk about it like it's real.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.881
Like it's... like it's spiritual.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.967
After all these years,

32:48.968 --> 32:50.802
how do you still believe in that?

32:50.803 --> 32:54.639
The machine came to us
from across time and space.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.974
You were there,

32:55.975 --> 32:57.809
you're one of the original souls.

32:57.810 --> 32:58.810
Why is it, do you think,

32:58.811 --> 33:00.478
that Rainey didn't
let us build another altar?

33:00.479 --> 33:03.398
Had us holed up in some
rotted-out mansion basement,

33:03.399 --> 33:05.358
had us in some decrepit zoo building?

33:05.359 --> 33:06.693
It's so he could control it.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.069
The altar is sacred--

33:08.070 --> 33:09.654
It's electrical!

33:09.655 --> 33:13.366
The Soul Exchanger
isn't some holy relic,

33:13.367 --> 33:15.493
it's a piece of technology.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.829
It always has been, it always will be.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.664
You're insane.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.834
Your drones are dropping like flies.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.378
Your insurgency is a failure,

33:25.379 --> 33:27.422
You have ruined everything.

33:27.423 --> 33:30.216
The detective whose partner you killed,

33:30.217 --> 33:32.010
he's looking for you,
and he's not going to go away.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.513
I have the other machine!

33:39.184 --> 33:42.687
So that means you follow me now.

33:42.688 --> 33:46.024
So you are gonna go off
and collect whoever you can,

33:46.025 --> 33:47.108
whoever hasn't run away.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.860
My men are bringing in
the relevant parties.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.194
I will have the machine tonight,

33:50.195 --> 33:51.279
and I will have it at the temple,

33:51.280 --> 33:53.240
and you will meet me there.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.201
I don't give a shit

33:57.202 --> 33:59.912
whether you believe in me or not,

33:59.913 --> 34:02.249
but I am the Supreme Soul now.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.049
Please be quiet.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.134
<i>Please...</i>

34:13.135 --> 34:15.136
<i>you gotta stop screaming.</i>

34:16.221 --> 34:18.306
Can you stop screaming?

34:18.307 --> 34:20.224
Listen, you gotta stop screaming.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.436
Can you stop screaming?

34:26.607 --> 34:27.440
Okay...

34:27.441 --> 34:28.566
--Struck by a car today.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.568
While informing his next of kin,

34:30.569 --> 34:33.071
police uncovered
a shocking discovery--

34:33.072 --> 34:34.572
<i>two women who had been trapped</i>

34:34.573 --> 34:36.908
<i>and kept prisoner
in Gifford's basement</i>

34:36.909 --> 34:37.950
<i>for over three months.</i>

34:39.078 --> 34:40.078
I'm gonna kill that guy.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.621
Hey!

34:43.999 --> 34:45.750
Oh, God...

34:47.252 --> 34:49.003
Get this thing out of my leg!

34:49.004 --> 34:51.422
I read on the Internet
that you're not supposed to--

34:51.423 --> 34:53.925
I don't care what
the stupid rectangle tells you to do!

34:53.926 --> 34:56.094
If I'm supposed to die, I will!

34:56.095 --> 34:58.763
I'm not gonna go to the hospital.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.098
I give up.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.016
Just do it, I give up.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.643
You get hurt once and you give up?

35:03.644 --> 35:05.978
I can't get hurt.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.855
I'm always safe, I can't get hurt...

35:07.856 --> 35:09.482
Yeah, well,
a roller coaster is safe, too,

35:09.483 --> 35:10.775
unless it goes off the tracks.

35:10.776 --> 35:11.776
Gobbledy-gook!

35:11.777 --> 35:14.112
What do you even know
about anything?

35:14.113 --> 35:15.863
You assumed too much, Bart.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.866
You say you kill
whoever you feel like killing.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.119
Did you feel like killing
Dirk Gently right then?

35:21.120 --> 35:22.787
He was...

35:22.788 --> 35:24.498
He was there.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.959
And I mean...

35:27.960 --> 35:31.963
It was... It was different, but...

35:31.964 --> 35:33.131
I knew-- I thought--

35:33.132 --> 35:34.757
I thought that I knew that I was--

35:34.758 --> 35:36.260
That's what I thought.

35:37.219 --> 35:39.178
You shoot up a mall
in the middle of the day,

35:39.179 --> 35:40.304
and we just happen to get away?

35:40.305 --> 35:42.974
I walk you into a crowded hotel

35:42.975 --> 35:44.142
with a knife in your leg,

35:44.143 --> 35:46.853
and we just happen
to not get noticed?

35:46.854 --> 35:49.147
It's the universe,

35:49.148 --> 35:51.566
it's the stream of creation.

35:51.567 --> 35:55.236
I have been doing nothing
every day of my life,

35:55.237 --> 35:57.655
and thinking it was that,

35:57.656 --> 35:59.073
nothing,

35:59.074 --> 36:00.324
it was nothing.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.493
<i>Okay, but now I can see it,</i>

36:02.494 --> 36:04.162
<i>and I don't know what it is,</i>

36:04.163 --> 36:05.371
<i>and I can't name it,</i>

36:05.372 --> 36:07.331
but I've seen it.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.709
All right, and that's greater
than understanding.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.586
Okay? I believe.

36:11.587 --> 36:14.006
I believe in you, Bart.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.674
You talk to me...

36:16.675 --> 36:17.842
a lot.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.511
Look, we're gonna get you
out of this tub, all right?

36:20.512 --> 36:23.181
We're gonna find you clothes
without blood on them,

36:23.182 --> 36:25.349
gonna get you a weapon,

36:25.350 --> 36:26.350
and we're gonna get out there

36:26.351 --> 36:27.852
and follow the web
of the universe,

36:27.853 --> 36:30.605
so you can do
what you're supposed to do.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.024
Kill Dirk Gently.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.401
Or something.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.571
Okay. Okay.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.448
But first...

36:59.343 --> 37:01.010
Psst!

37:01.011 --> 37:01.928
What Happened?

37:01.929 --> 37:02.929
Where's Amanda?

37:02.930 --> 37:04.263
She's gone.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.306
Gone?

37:05.307 --> 37:07.516
Like, she is... gone?

37:07.517 --> 37:09.310
She hasn't stopped existing,

37:09.311 --> 37:11.437
she's just gone.

37:11.438 --> 37:15.107
Is this where the universe
was supposed to lead us?

37:15.108 --> 37:16.777
Maybe.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.111
Who hit you?

37:19.112 --> 37:21.113
The detective,

37:21.114 --> 37:23.032
Estevez.

37:23.033 --> 37:26.161
He's, like,
gone kind of crazy, I guess.

37:27.871 --> 37:28.704
Where's Farah?

37:28.705 --> 37:30.874
I don't know.

37:35.796 --> 37:38.798
Are these guys gonna kill us?

37:38.799 --> 37:40.508
I mean...

37:40.509 --> 37:42.218
I should hope not.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.472
This guy again.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.683
This is it.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.978
He'll explain everything.
He's gonna have the answers.

37:53.397 --> 37:56.149
I've been waiting for you two
for a long time.

38:03.532 --> 38:04.992
What is going on?

38:05.993 --> 38:08.661
Who are you guys?
Did Patrick Spring hire you?

38:08.662 --> 38:11.539
If not, then what are you?
Are you detectives?

38:11.540 --> 38:14.000
No, because you're a... You're a bellhop!

38:14.001 --> 38:15.167
<i>You were at the hotel!</i>

38:15.168 --> 38:16.544
And you! You're who?

38:16.545 --> 38:18.838
- What, the FBI? No?
- No.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.048
Then how does
the FBI figure into this?

38:21.049 --> 38:22.383
Who shot Ned?

38:22.384 --> 38:25.511
How did you know that Farah Black
was gonna be in that apartment?

38:25.512 --> 38:27.013
I mean, what kind of
crazy coincidence is that?

38:27.014 --> 38:28.889
<i>Where's the kitten?</i>

38:28.890 --> 38:29.849
Where's my dog?

38:29.850 --> 38:32.018
Why did you burn down my house?

38:32.019 --> 38:34.020
Who has my dog right now?
Is it the police?

38:34.021 --> 38:35.354
<i>Do the police have my dog?</i>

38:35.355 --> 38:36.856
Who beat up Ed and Zed?

38:36.857 --> 38:39.191
<i>Was it your guys? Other guys?</i>

38:39.192 --> 38:42.028
How many different sets of guys
are in this situation?

38:42.029 --> 38:45.574
How does Patrick Spring
be in two places at the same time?

38:49.536 --> 38:54.206
Aw..... nuts.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.208
We-we don't, uh...

38:56.209 --> 38:57.877
Sorry, I guess.

38:57.878 --> 39:00.212
I, like, can answer four
of those questions, total,

39:00.213 --> 39:01.422
if I'm being honest.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.757
But you were there!

39:02.758 --> 39:03.591
Where?

39:03.592 --> 39:05.384
At the hotel!

39:05.385 --> 39:06.761
When Patrick Spring died,

39:06.762 --> 39:07.970
<i>you were both there together!</i>

39:07.971 --> 39:10.057
You were wearing my coat!
This coat!

39:11.224 --> 39:12.558
<i>Wait...</i>

39:12.559 --> 39:14.561
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

39:22.235 --> 39:23.778
It's the same machine.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.738
What?
What? What? What? What?

39:25.739 --> 39:26.906
Ooh...

39:26.907 --> 39:28.282
Todd, solved it.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.575
<i>The dates!</i>

39:29.576 --> 39:31.410
Of course! So stupid.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.453
Makes total sense in hindsight,

39:32.454 --> 39:34.413
amazed I didn't guess it, honestly.

39:34.414 --> 39:35.664
- We've got to go in there.
- Stop, stop--

39:35.665 --> 39:38.584
Edgar Spring, Zackariah Webb,
Patrick Spring,

39:38.585 --> 39:39.835
the whole thing.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.504
I can get us out of here,

39:41.505 --> 39:42.922
I solved the case.

39:42.923 --> 39:45.591
No, no, no, no, no,
you stop talking to him,

39:45.592 --> 39:47.468
and start talking to me,
giving me answers.

39:47.469 --> 39:49.637
I want you two
to give me some answers now--

39:51.848 --> 39:54.183
No, no, no...
No, no...

39:54.184 --> 39:55.434
No, no, no, no, no.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.146
Fred, get out there,
find out what that is!

40:07.030 --> 40:08.156
No!

40:19.626 --> 40:22.045
Todd, run!

40:25.841 --> 40:27.633
Dirk, what's the plan?

40:27.634 --> 40:29.009
There's a plug just like this

40:29.010 --> 40:30.803
in the basement
of Patrick Spring's house,

40:30.804 --> 40:33.139
and there was another one
under the Ridgely, remember?

40:33.140 --> 40:35.349
They're gonna come in here
and kill us, Dirk!

40:35.350 --> 40:37.476
We won't be here, Todd!

40:37.477 --> 40:38.644
Come on, grab hold!

40:41.148 --> 40:42.314
I'm saving us!

40:42.315 --> 40:43.899
How are you going to save us

40:43.900 --> 40:45.192
with an Unlimited Energy Machine?

40:45.193 --> 40:47.069
It's not an Unlimited Energy Machine,

40:47.070 --> 40:48.821
and that's not
the Soul Exchanger.

40:48.822 --> 40:51.740
Well, they both are,
but they're not, too.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.534
Come on, grab tight!

40:55.704 --> 40:57.371
There's not going
to be a murder, Todd.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.999
We're going to fix everything.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.168
Watch this.
