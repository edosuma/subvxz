All the hippest ways to die
have been taken.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.359
Guys, i'm not overdosing.
That's way too cliche.

08:14.361 --> 08:17.028
What if somebody shot you?

08:17.030 --> 08:19.231
[scoffs]
who would want to shoot me?

08:20.968 --> 08:22.501
Seriously, guys?

08:22.503 --> 08:24.169
I mean, i know there's a lot
of residual anger

08:24.171 --> 08:25.670
From the old days,

08:25.672 --> 08:27.038
But one of you guys
would actually shoot me?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.607
Think how dope that story
would be.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.275
"lead guitar player
shoots lead singer"

08:30.277 --> 08:31.643
Would make the stones
and aerosmith

08:31.645 --> 08:32.944
Look like total pussies.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.380
- Suck on that, oasis.
- So typical.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.549
Why can't the bass player
be the guy who shoots the guy?

08:37.551 --> 08:39.718
I don't know; assassination
sounds really cool.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.354
Such a great name for a band:
The assassins.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.122
- Yeah.
- We actually get to shoot him?

08:44.124 --> 08:46.725
No, no, we fake-assassinate him,

08:46.727 --> 08:49.461
And then he fake-survives
the surgery.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.630
And then we form a real band
called the assassins.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.865
We will get a spike
on old heathens albums

08:53.867 --> 08:55.667
From the conspiracy freaks.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.969
Plus, it's a great origins story
for gigi's new band.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.639
This is something
i can work with.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.040
It's pretty awesome,
honey.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.642
- I'm down.
- Yeah, me too.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.043
What,
i don't get a vote?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.311
Technically, you're dead.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.712
(gigi)
listen to me, okay?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.347
We could be making history here.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.216
This could be even cooler
than biggie and tupac.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.984
Your own guitar player
shoots you dead?

09:12.986 --> 09:14.386
No one will ever forget you.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.454
You'd be
a rock-and-roll legend forever.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.360
You know what?

09:22.362 --> 09:23.995
I really do love you.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.936
"my deepest sympathy.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.504
"if you need anything,
just call.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.705
Love, richie."

09:33.707 --> 09:35.373
How you know richie sambora,
honey?

09:35.375 --> 09:38.944
Oh, we met in the '80s just once
before i knew you.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.545
Guess i made an impression,
huh?

09:40.547 --> 09:41.580
Guess so.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.081
- Hey, hey, dad.
- What?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.616
<i>Rolling stone</i> online
just mentioned you.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.051
Aha.
What did they say, honey?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.086
You watch now,
baby girl.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.523
You're about to see your dad's
true and lasting legacy, okay?

09:51.525 --> 09:52.891
(ava)
that's outrageous.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.626
I know; what is that,
like, 1/8 of a page?

09:54.628 --> 09:57.362
(ava)
"influential singer johnny rock
found dead."

09:57.364 --> 10:00.131
There it is: "influential."
huh? What did i say?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.267
Hey, look at that:
"daughter found smokin' hot!"

10:02.269 --> 10:05.937
(gigi)
wow, it's, like, everywhere.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.405
Here,
click that video link.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.374
(matt)
rock never became famous,

10:09.376 --> 10:13.778
But in new york city's early
'90s music scene and beyond,

10:13.780 --> 10:15.981
He was infamous for his ability
to break up

10:15.983 --> 10:17.983
Every single band he started.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.218
The heathens broke up
the same day

10:20.220 --> 10:22.120
Their first record was released.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.788
The johnny rock show imploded

10:23.790 --> 10:25.991
One week before signing
their record deal

10:25.993 --> 10:29.260
Due to a series of violent
vomiting incidents.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.763
The johnny rock affair
did sign a record deal

10:31.765 --> 10:33.565
But never made it
into the studio

10:33.567 --> 10:37.168
After their bass player entered
a medically induced coma.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.672
And as rock aged, the critically
acclaimed band skinny bitch

10:40.674 --> 10:44.275
Couldn't survive his inability
to finish a single show.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.577
That's a bunch of bullshit.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.245
It's really sad.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.814
He was a nice guy,
real talented.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.018
He as a bit of a mess,
but we all were back in the day.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.419
You knew joan jett?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.021
- Oh, yes, i did.
- She's so badass.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.322
You have no idea.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.424
When did you meet
joan jett?

10:59.426 --> 11:00.859
When did i meet joan jett?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.360
I told you about
when i met joan jett.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.863
It was--ira,
what was that, like--

11:04.865 --> 11:06.297
I'm thirsty.
Who's thirsty?

11:06.299 --> 11:08.667
- I want a drink.
- It was, like--

11:08.669 --> 11:10.335
How do you know joan jett?

11:10.337 --> 11:13.204
Bam and i--bam--bam, right,
remember we, um, we--

11:13.206 --> 11:14.506
It was a benefit,
right, bam?

11:14.508 --> 11:17.108
What was it for,
the thing?

11:17.110 --> 11:20.712
I would like a macaroon
right now.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.514
He's hungry.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.216
He's just a little hungry.
That's all.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.552
- Bedroom?
- Oh, yeah.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.023
When did you sleep
with joan jett?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.192
Okay, relax, relax, relax.
It was a long time ago.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.794
Uh-huh,
before or after we met?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.062
- [sighs]
- after we met, yeah.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.563
Okay, okay,
you kicked me out,

11:38.565 --> 11:39.898
And there was a benefit
for the diabetics.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.332
Remember that band?

11:41.334 --> 11:43.134
We were gonna get the drummer
some new feet.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.803
Joan was there.
Everybody was drunk.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.071
And it was just sex.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.839
Just sex
with joan [bleep] jett.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.407
- Honey, honey, listen to me.
- How was it, john?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.709
Honey,
you don't want to know.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.377
- How was it, john?
- It was great.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.845
- Oh, yeah, i'm sure it was.
- She said it was great.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.513
She's into girls.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.415
Did you even ask if she would be
willing to do a three-way?

11:57.417 --> 11:58.750
No.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.752
Oh, you selfish
son of a bitch.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.754
You never told me you were
friends with richie sambora.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.689
Because i'm not friends
with richie sambora.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.392
I just--met him in the--

12:07.394 --> 12:08.660
Oh, my god.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.228
You [bleep] richie sambora.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.430
- Oh, no--okay,
but this was before--

12:12.432 --> 12:14.099
This was before i knew you.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.067
I don't give a shit, honey.
They were a hair band.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.203
Oh, no, they were<i> the</i> hair band,
john, okay?

12:18.205 --> 12:19.504
It was the '80s.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.772
Fringe leather jackets
were hot.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.507
He had fringe leather pants.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.209
We wore the same eyeliner
and the same brand

12:24.211 --> 12:26.010
Of leopard-print thongs.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.679
- Ew.
- Oh, ew.

12:27.681 --> 12:30.081
Who else do i not know about?
Go ahead. Who else?

12:31.351 --> 12:32.350
Bon jovi.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.918
Jon bon jovi?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.553
What, did you sleep with
the whole friggin' band?

12:35.555 --> 12:38.556
No, i didn't sleep with
the whole freakin' band?

12:38.558 --> 12:40.825
The bass player
was an asshole.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.930
[whimpers]

12:51.805 --> 12:53.138
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.405
Gigi went up to the roof.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.640
You might want to go talk
to her.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.609
She's taking the news
pretty hard.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.144
It's got to be hard even to
pretend like your dad's dying.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.945
Yeah, no, it's not that.
She's anxious.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.814
I booked her and the band
at the glasslands

13:02.816 --> 13:04.816
For a special four-song set
tomorrow night.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.552
Oh, like, a memorial
tribute thing to me?

13:07.554 --> 13:09.320
It's a tribute
to her twitter feed

13:09.322 --> 13:12.157
And my relationship to the guys
at bowery presents.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.659
Oh, okay.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.761
But there is gonna be, like,
a memorial tribute thing to me--

13:16.763 --> 13:18.296
Go talk to your daughter.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.764
Okay.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.599
Awesome.

13:21.601 --> 13:25.303
Great.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.405
Hey, you don't want to do
the show?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.740
No, i want to do the gig,

13:28.742 --> 13:29.941
But when ira mentioned it,
i freaked.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.643
Okay,
freaky is normal.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.344
No, i--i don't know.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.512
I just feel like
i don't know the songs.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.780
I feel like i can't do it.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.148
I feel like i don't want
to freak out

13:37.150 --> 13:38.316
In front of everybody
and freeze on stage,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.684
And i think mom was right.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.486
I think i never should have
done it.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.687
I shouldn't have come here.
I can't do it, dad.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.922
- Okay, come here.
- No, dad, no.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.824
Shh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.760
Chill out.
Relax, okay?

13:48.762 --> 13:50.762
This is completely normal.

13:50.764 --> 13:51.863
This is what
you're gonna do.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.331
Tonight go over
the songs again.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.799
You'll go to soundcheck tomorrow
with the band,

13:54.801 --> 13:56.501
Like, an hour early;
you'll settle in.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.869
You're gonna be fine.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.838
Did you ever get nervous
before big gigs?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.372
Yeah, you have to get--
if you don't get nervous,

14:01.374 --> 14:02.674
That's when you should
start worrying,

14:02.676 --> 14:03.875
Because it's part of the--

14:03.877 --> 14:05.543
Butterflies is part
of the thing.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.345
But you never went on stage
and freaked out and froze?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.713
Nah,
i loved every minute of it.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.381
But then i don't understand.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.617
How did you destroy every band
that you were ever in?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.319
I didn't destroy the bands.
I dug the bands.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.154
The bands were--
you know, they broke up.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.056
Yeah, well, mom told me you had
a fear of success.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.657
Why would i have a fear
of success?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.192
I don't know,
because you're afraid of change.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.527
Yeah, how about your mom?

14:22.529 --> 14:23.995
She was the one--
she had the fear of success.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.497
She had to move to ohio
to get away from it.

14:26.499 --> 14:30.168
Yeah, she moved to ohio,
which was a giant change.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.303
Did you ever hear the story
of jonah and the whale?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.872
Yeah, i think i saw it.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.241
That was that pretentious
indie flick with jeff daniels

14:36.243 --> 14:38.009
As the asshole dad
in brooklyn?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.377
No, it's from the bible.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.213
It's--okay, basically,

14:42.215 --> 14:45.250
God tells jonah that he has to
go warn this city of sinners.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.585
I don't--i forget the name.
Let's just say it's brooklyn.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.387
- Because he's gonna smite them.
- Okay. Smite them?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.889
But jonah doesn't want
to do it.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.490
So he jumps into a boat
to escape his fate,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.058
And the whale eats him,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.261
And he gets trapped
in the whale's belly.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.429
So then he besieges god
to come save him,

14:58.431 --> 15:02.000
So god has the whale puke him up
onto the shore,

15:02.002 --> 15:04.569
And jonah goes
to williamsburg,

15:04.571 --> 15:07.205
And he tells everyone to stop
acting like hipster jerk-offs,

15:07.207 --> 15:08.873
And he becomes a big hero;
he saves the day.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.675
God lets them all live,
and that's what it was.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.010
He was afraid of change.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.444
He was afraid of his destiny.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.846
This is a thing.

15:14.848 --> 15:16.047
This is, like, a true,
psychological thing.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.882
It's called a jonah complex.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.852
I can't believe
you haven't heard of this.

15:20.854 --> 15:23.087
Shit.
I wonder if i was afraid.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.457
Dad, listen to me.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.459
I am your whale, okay?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.094
I am your second chance.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.930
I am--i am spitting you back up
onto the shore.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.564
You are?

15:33.566 --> 15:35.199
'cause now we actually
sound like we're in

15:35.201 --> 15:36.467
The shitty jeff daniels movie.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.069
Ugh.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.204
God, i hope i don't inherit
your complex.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.940
What,
the--the fear thing?

15:41.942 --> 15:43.474
Why would you inherit that?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.243
Well, because i got mom's hair
and your eyes.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.312
I got mom's tits and your ass.
