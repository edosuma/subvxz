WEBVTT

00:04.897 --> 00:06.413
Can I get a little help, please?

00:06.565 --> 00:09.341
Oh, sure. That top doesn't
match that skirt.

00:10.327 --> 00:13.754
Why would you pack all of
this cast-iron cookware anyway?

00:13.906 --> 00:15.663
The only thing you ever made
in a kitchen is that sign

00:15.758 --> 00:18.575
that says, "Nothing tastes
as good as skinny feels."

00:18.594 --> 00:20.561
Oh, so you<i> did</i> see it?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.670
-Hey.
-Oh.

00:22.765 --> 00:25.858
Sorry. I had to shake a pack
of handsy old ladies.

00:26.085 --> 00:29.528
One of them tried to tuck
a savings bond in my waistband.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.847
This is a great apartment.

00:32.867 --> 00:37.611
It's smaller than I remember,
but maybe that's a good thing.

00:37.763 --> 00:40.039
It'll help me get used
to being in a coffin.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.948
Oh, come on. Look here.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.709
You were so excited
about this place.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.603
You loved the pool, the spa,

00:46.622 --> 00:48.438
and I just saw a guy
in the dining room

00:48.440 --> 00:50.549
dropping pills
like a busted piñata.

00:50.700 --> 00:54.369
I know. It's just different
now that I'm here.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.446
Man, take a look
at these activities. Look.

00:56.465 --> 00:59.707
You can go on a tour
of the region's finest wineries.

00:59.876 --> 01:00.801
Ah, yes.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.394
Nothing says a fine merlot

01:02.546 --> 01:05.122
like the hills
of Central Kentucky.

01:05.124 --> 01:06.548
Perhaps I can pair it

01:06.642 --> 01:09.384
with a hard-boiled egg
from a large jar.

01:09.553 --> 01:12.145
Hey, I'm sure
you're gonna find your people.

01:12.298 --> 01:14.481
But you can't give up
and not try.

01:14.633 --> 01:16.867
It's not like being my mother.

01:17.803 --> 01:19.319
Look, it's my first night here.

01:19.471 --> 01:21.747
I miss my house,
I miss my things.

01:21.898 --> 01:24.308
Oh, but you brought
my baby blanket.

01:24.401 --> 01:26.568
-Aw. That's so sweet.
-(Kat laughs)

01:26.645 --> 01:28.478
Is that what
that ratty thing is?

01:28.497 --> 01:32.316
Oh. I was just using it to make
sure my gin didn't break.

01:32.334 --> 01:35.427
At least
I have one friend here.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.246
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

01:38.307 --> 01:40.248
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

01:41.102 --> 01:43.343
Hey, how's Sheila doing
at the retirement home?

01:43.495 --> 01:44.919
Oh, I don't know.

01:44.997 --> 01:46.997
I texted her and said, "Let me
know if you need anything"

01:47.090 --> 01:48.515
on her first day,
and she replied "K."

01:48.609 --> 01:51.835
So then, I texted her again
yesterday, and she said, "KK."

01:51.854 --> 01:54.187
I'm terrified
to send a third text.

01:54.356 --> 01:55.781
Well,
if you're worried about her,

01:55.932 --> 01:57.449
why don't you just
go visit her?

01:57.601 --> 01:59.601
Ooh, and when you go,
take butterscotch hard candy.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.269
For old people, they're like
cigarettes in prison.

02:01.363 --> 02:03.347
Wait,
where's your engagement ring?

02:03.365 --> 02:05.682
-Oh.
-(gasps) It's missing?

02:05.775 --> 02:08.109
All right, everybody, stand up,
turn out your pockets.

02:08.203 --> 02:09.294
My friend's ring is missing.

02:09.446 --> 02:11.371
I'm looking at you,
cargo shorts.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.373
It's not missing,
I just wasn't wearing it.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.284
Oh, oh. Sorry, cargo shorts,
that was profiling,

02:16.362 --> 02:18.211
and I am not proud of that.

02:18.364 --> 02:20.030
Is everything all right?

02:20.048 --> 02:21.031
Yeah.

02:21.049 --> 02:22.215
It's just--

02:22.368 --> 02:24.125
I mean, what do you think
about my ring?

02:24.145 --> 02:25.144
Oh, well, uh,

02:25.295 --> 02:27.663
mm, I think it's...

02:28.649 --> 02:31.150
Since when does my opinion
on fashion matter?

02:31.377 --> 02:32.634
You know, I just started
wearing thongs.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.211
I'm not even sure
I've got it on right.

02:34.229 --> 02:36.713
See, I knew it.
You hate it.

02:36.732 --> 02:37.972
No, not at all.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.883
So you mean to tell me
if Max gave you this,

02:39.902 --> 02:42.219
-you would be happy?
-No, not at all.

02:42.237 --> 02:44.571
Look, I love Carter.

02:44.723 --> 02:46.556
I'm just not sure
I love this ring.

02:46.575 --> 02:48.058
Also, I hate this ring.

02:48.151 --> 02:49.835
Well, have you tried
talking to him about it?

02:49.986 --> 02:51.670
I mean, he might be hurt
at first,

02:51.897 --> 02:53.397
but he'll get over it.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.340
At the end of the day, he just
wants to make you happy.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.843
Yeah, and I just want
to make him happy.

02:57.994 --> 03:00.328
Maybe I'll just learn
to like it.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.406
I mean, we're friends now.

03:02.424 --> 03:04.057
(Randi chuckles)

03:09.005 --> 03:10.731
Mother, it's me.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.901
I brought wine.

03:15.011 --> 03:17.254
That's weird.
She always ignores me,

03:17.347 --> 03:18.755
but never wine.

03:18.774 --> 03:21.758
Something must be wrong.
I'm gonna break this door down.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.944
Oh, or just open it.

03:24.096 --> 03:26.688
So I said, "Well, I may be
losing my sight,

03:26.765 --> 03:29.374
but you never had any taste."

03:29.526 --> 03:30.542
(laughter)

03:30.769 --> 03:31.785
Hey.

03:31.954 --> 03:34.604
Oh, Katharine, I was just
talking about you.

03:34.698 --> 03:36.215
What's going on here?

03:36.291 --> 03:38.050
Someone find "Part B."

03:38.277 --> 03:40.219
I think I just found<i> par-tay.</i>

03:40.370 --> 03:42.963
Just a few friends over
for drinks.

03:43.115 --> 03:46.225
Everyone dumped their
expired meds in a bowl,

03:46.452 --> 03:48.543
and we're playing
"prescription roulette."

03:48.637 --> 03:51.045
Lightweight Charlie
couldn't handle an Ambien.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.957
Well, I'm so glad
you made some friends.

03:53.976 --> 03:57.402
Hi, I'm Katharine,
but you can call me Kat.

03:57.554 --> 03:59.887
See what I did there?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.240
Hi, Kat, I'm Patty.

04:01.467 --> 04:03.800
I love your shoes.
Where'd you get 'em?

04:03.819 --> 04:05.410
Oh, you can't get 'em
in a store.

04:05.637 --> 04:06.411
You need a prescription.

04:06.638 --> 04:07.895
Who's your foot guy?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.414
Well, I used to go
to Lieberman.

04:09.566 --> 04:10.565
Oh, Lieberman.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.251
Would it kill you
to validate parking?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.477
(laughs)
Right?

04:13.495 --> 04:14.978
I mean, I've already got
a pain in my foot,

04:14.997 --> 04:17.481
do I also need a pain
in my tuchus?

04:17.499 --> 04:18.740
(laughter)

04:18.759 --> 04:19.983
Yes, hilarious.

04:20.002 --> 04:22.243
Okay, thank you for the wine.
Drive safe.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.412
You know, you should try
Orwasher.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.839
He's got tattoos,

04:25.933 --> 04:28.767
but I hear it's not
a Satan thing anymore.

04:28.918 --> 04:30.936
He's my new guy.
He is the best.

04:31.013 --> 04:32.271
And not to brag, but

04:32.498 --> 04:34.606
on his website,
I'm the "before" picture

04:34.833 --> 04:36.182
for hammertoe.

04:36.351 --> 04:39.185
Get out. Sheila,
you did not tell us

04:39.280 --> 04:40.670
that your daughter was
a model.

04:40.764 --> 04:43.673
(laughs) If you don't notice
a resemblance,

04:43.675 --> 04:45.117
it's because she paid
a lot of money

04:45.268 --> 04:46.693
to not look like me.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.012
-(laughter)
-Who needs more rosé?

04:49.181 --> 04:50.998
(snorts) Don't bury me!

04:52.534 --> 04:54.351
Here you go, Billy.

04:54.369 --> 04:55.943
So, how were your holidays?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.521
Did they ever find
your big toe?

04:57.539 --> 05:00.132
No. And I called the airline
and everything.

05:01.193 --> 05:02.134
My holidays were nice.

05:02.361 --> 05:04.027
I spent Christmas Eve
with my kids,

05:04.046 --> 05:05.304
Christmas Day
with my other kids.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.864
Then, on New Year's Eve,
I met a redhead.

05:07.883 --> 05:09.382
Tried to make some more kids.

05:09.535 --> 05:10.700
How about you?

05:10.719 --> 05:12.369
Ah, Randi and I got engaged.

05:12.462 --> 05:13.795
-Hey, that's great.
-Mm-hmm.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.205
I hope you invite me
to the wedding.

05:15.223 --> 05:17.733
I can dance as good as anyone
with a whole foot.

05:18.894 --> 05:20.468
There's my soon-to-be-wife.

05:20.562 --> 05:21.895
Just say "fiancée."

05:22.047 --> 05:24.156
That is French.
I do not appropriate.

05:24.383 --> 05:26.232
(chuckles) Uh, do you have
a second to talk?

05:26.385 --> 05:28.885
Sure. But first,
show Billy your ring.

05:28.978 --> 05:30.162
Oh, um...

05:30.313 --> 05:32.055
BILLY:
Wow, look at that.

05:32.148 --> 05:33.723
It's like a classy
hood ornament.

05:33.817 --> 05:35.575
I designed it myself.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.911
I could have gone
to some high-end jewelry store

05:38.063 --> 05:39.821
and picked out the biggest
diamond they had.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.840
Hold up, that was an option?

05:42.067 --> 05:44.125
Check it out.
The diamond's a heart

05:44.160 --> 05:45.993
because I love Randi,

05:46.088 --> 05:48.363
And, baby, tell him why
the ruby's a heart.

05:48.365 --> 05:51.533
Be-Because we love
the Louisville Cardinals.

05:51.593 --> 05:53.093
Throw up the "L".

05:53.169 --> 05:55.837
Yeah, we throwin' up.
(chuckles)

05:55.856 --> 05:58.081
Man, I've never been so proud
of anything in my life,

05:58.100 --> 05:59.524
and I have a son.

05:59.676 --> 06:01.434
So, baby, what'd you want
to talk about?

06:01.528 --> 06:02.510
-Me?
-Yeah.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.345
Oh, uh, Kat got a thong,

06:04.365 --> 06:05.864
and she doesn't know how
to wear it.

06:06.015 --> 06:09.201
Yeah? She got a date
for next New Year's?

06:10.596 --> 06:14.355
You know, Frank and I have
a son about your age.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.023
He has so many model trains

06:16.118 --> 06:19.026
-they might do a YouTube
about him.
-(Kat chuckles)

06:19.121 --> 06:23.048
Well, he's got a very nice
caboose, but I'm taken.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.441
Well, of course you are,

06:24.534 --> 06:26.126
a foot model
with your personality.

06:26.278 --> 06:27.719
(laughs)
You know what, Frank,

06:27.871 --> 06:31.114
-you just earned yourself
a butterscotch.
-Ooh.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.116
Will none of these pills
kick in?

06:33.209 --> 06:35.209
And, uh, check out my fella.

06:35.378 --> 06:37.345
He's a musician,
and get this,

06:37.398 --> 06:39.789
none of his songs
have curse words.

06:39.808 --> 06:40.807
Mm.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.292
Hotsy-totsy.

06:42.310 --> 06:44.552
Tom Selleck, move over.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.646
Speaking of which,
is<i> Blue Bloods</i> tonight?

06:46.798 --> 06:48.073
No, that's Friday at 10:00.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.409
I record it 'cause who can
stay up that late?

06:50.560 --> 06:52.727
I mean, seriously,
I appreciate

06:52.821 --> 06:54.137
everyone who watches,

06:54.230 --> 06:56.665
but you 9:30 Fox viewers...

06:58.568 --> 07:00.234
You know what'd be fun?

07:00.328 --> 07:03.088
We should get naked
and go into the hot tub.

07:03.165 --> 07:04.831
-I'm in.
-Great.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.167
I just got these
bad boys lifted.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.744
(chuckles) It was my
birthday present.

07:09.838 --> 07:12.580
Wait, hang on,
has anyone had diarrhea

07:12.674 --> 07:13.765
in the last few weeks?

07:13.917 --> 07:16.159
'Cause then it's not safe.

07:16.252 --> 07:18.586
What are you looking
at me for?

07:18.680 --> 07:21.690
You're the ones that wanted
to go for Thai food.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.501
Thanks, Katharine.

07:24.519 --> 07:26.928
Well, have any of you
ever played Scrabble

07:26.947 --> 07:28.188
in French?

07:28.340 --> 07:31.265
-It's a panic.
-Ooh-la-la.

07:31.359 --> 07:35.454
I wonder what combination
of these pills will kill me.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.278
Okay, here's me
and the Valley Hills gang

07:44.298 --> 07:47.190
on the bus
heading to the casino.

07:47.209 --> 07:49.859
That's Frank and Charlie.

07:49.953 --> 07:51.970
Oh, here's Patty playing
keep-away

07:52.121 --> 07:53.955
with Mindy's diabetes
medication.

07:54.032 --> 07:56.199
That's just so classic Patty.

07:56.368 --> 07:59.369
(forced chuckle)
So Patty.

07:59.538 --> 08:00.645
Hey, you two.

08:00.797 --> 08:01.813
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.373
All right, I'm gonna
go to the gym.

08:03.466 --> 08:04.724
-I'll see you later.
-Bye.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.543
Is that a new perfume?

08:06.561 --> 08:08.970
Oh, Bengay. Mindy had some
in her purse.

08:09.064 --> 08:11.656
That bus ride,
heck on my sciatica.

08:11.883 --> 08:14.934
No, no, save the sexy talk
for tonight.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.162
-(chuckles)
-See you, Sheila.

08:17.313 --> 08:18.312
I'll take a chai tea.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.481
Oh, fun fact, "chai" means tea,

08:20.501 --> 08:23.651
so you really just
asked me for tea tea.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.819
Fascinating.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.132
I'll take it to go-go
away from you-you.

08:30.418 --> 08:31.826
Are you excited
about bingo tonight?

08:31.903 --> 08:34.070
I know Frank is psyched
because he just found out

08:34.163 --> 08:36.573
that his tumor is "B-Nine".

08:36.666 --> 08:38.165
Actually, you can't come.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.426
Bingo is for residents only.

08:40.579 --> 08:43.004
Really?
That's so disappointing.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.006
I already told everyone
I was coming.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.174
I've literally never
said this before,

08:47.269 --> 08:48.676
but can't we bend the rules?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.845
Mm, they're very strict
about this policy.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.698
Huh. That seems really unfair,

08:53.925 --> 08:56.125
keeping me out
just because I'm young.

08:56.127 --> 08:59.371
When it rains,
do not my knees ache?

08:59.598 --> 09:02.115
Sorry, dear.
And for the record,

09:02.267 --> 09:05.101
you haven't been young
since you were eight

09:05.103 --> 09:08.129
and dressed as democracy
for Halloween.

09:11.293 --> 09:13.701
Hey, I got you something.

09:13.795 --> 09:16.613
Oh, you did?
Is it edible?

09:16.631 --> 09:17.872
Are you wearing it?

09:17.966 --> 09:19.724
-Is it both?
-(Randi laughs)

09:19.876 --> 09:21.117
Here.

09:21.136 --> 09:22.394
What's this?

09:22.545 --> 09:24.211
I got you an engagement ring,
too.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.972
I figured why should ladies
be the ones having all the fun

09:26.141 --> 09:27.715
wearing something for
the rest of their lives

09:27.734 --> 09:29.484
that they didn't pick out?

09:30.629 --> 09:33.071
Oh, wow, Randi.
You shouldn't have.

09:33.222 --> 09:36.132
Yeah, but I did,
just like you did.

09:36.225 --> 09:38.559
And if you don't like it,
that's totally fine.

09:38.653 --> 09:41.020
Just tell me and
I will happily take it back

09:41.172 --> 09:44.140
and not be upset at all,
because that's how mature,

09:44.159 --> 09:46.209
not-crazy people act.

09:46.828 --> 09:47.735
I don't like it.

09:47.829 --> 09:50.313
Oh, no problem.
Now, unrelated...

09:50.332 --> 09:52.649
-I<i> love</i> it!
-You do?

09:52.667 --> 09:54.241
Uh-huh! Look at this.

09:54.336 --> 09:55.819
It's got skeletons because

09:55.912 --> 09:57.429
till death do us part.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.656
And then, when you put
the two pieces together,

09:59.674 --> 10:00.840
it looks like they boning,

10:00.934 --> 10:03.268
which is one of our
favorite things to do.

10:03.495 --> 10:06.587
Well, remember that you're
gonna have to wear that ring

10:06.665 --> 10:09.499
every day until you die
and go to heaven,

10:09.517 --> 10:11.276
which means that
you're gonna have

10:11.427 --> 10:13.186
boning skeletons on your hand

10:13.280 --> 10:14.762
-when you meet Jesus.
-Oh...

10:14.781 --> 10:17.264
He gonna be so jealous.

10:17.342 --> 10:19.025
What the hell is wrong
with you?

10:19.177 --> 10:21.602
That ring is so ugly.
I bought it from a sex shop.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.363
And I'm not even sure
it's for a finger.

10:23.531 --> 10:25.990
But if you hate it,
then why'd you buy it?

10:26.143 --> 10:29.794
And, damn, I feel bad
for the dude this fits on.

10:29.946 --> 10:32.130
Babe, come sit with me.

10:34.876 --> 10:36.301
Look...

10:36.528 --> 10:39.787
I have to be honest with you.

10:39.865 --> 10:41.622
I don't like my ring.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.199
Wait, what?

10:43.218 --> 10:45.535
I love how much thought
you put into it,

10:45.628 --> 10:47.479
it's just... not my style.

10:47.706 --> 10:49.648
Not your style? I mean,
what could you possibly

10:49.799 --> 10:51.207
not like about it?

10:51.226 --> 10:52.709
That it's beautiful?
That it's thoughtful?

10:52.727 --> 10:53.877
That it glows in the dark?

10:53.970 --> 10:56.112
You never even mentioned that.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.898
I feel like such an idiot.

10:59.050 --> 11:00.400
I'm sorry.

11:00.552 --> 11:02.402
That's why I never wanted
to say anything.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.237
I spent the last month
thinking that you loved it

11:04.331 --> 11:05.571
because that's what
you told me

11:05.666 --> 11:06.739
and everyone we know.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.816
Not me.
She told me

11:08.910 --> 11:10.168
she ain't like it
from the jump.

11:10.319 --> 11:13.171
Okay, shut your mouth
before you taste this thing.

11:14.416 --> 11:17.509
-I can't believe this.
-W... Carter...

11:21.181 --> 11:22.255
I don't want to be<i> that guy,</i>

11:22.407 --> 11:24.683
but if you officially broke up,

11:24.759 --> 11:27.143
I'm interested.

11:29.431 --> 11:30.855
(laughter)

11:31.024 --> 11:33.583
You know my favorite part
of bingo?

11:33.601 --> 11:35.509
This.
(sniffs deeply)

11:35.529 --> 11:38.012
Oh, look out.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.848
Oh, I be trippin'.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.350
Oh, yeah, looks like
we're gonna be using

11:43.370 --> 11:47.247
-that bar in the shower tonight.
-Stop.

11:48.524 --> 11:49.949
I miss quaaludes.

11:50.101 --> 11:51.209
(laughter)

11:51.360 --> 11:53.436
♪<i> There was a daughter</i>
<i> had a game</i> ♪

11:53.455 --> 11:55.621
♪<i> And bingo was its name-oh.</i> ♪

11:55.698 --> 11:58.107
-PATTY: Oh, good, Kat's here.
-Hi, everyone.

11:58.159 --> 12:01.368
For those of you
who haven't met me B-four,

12:01.388 --> 12:02.628
my name is Kat Silver.

12:02.781 --> 12:04.872
And you might think
I work hard on these puns,

12:04.966 --> 12:08.134
but my sense of humor is
N-Eight.

12:08.286 --> 12:10.303
-(laughter)
-Katharine.

12:10.455 --> 12:12.455
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

12:12.590 --> 12:14.566
I told you bingo was
for residents only.

12:14.793 --> 12:17.977
Oh, that's why I volunteered
to be the belle of the balls.

12:18.129 --> 12:19.571
(chuckles)
Gotta love a loophole.

12:19.798 --> 12:21.740
Why does it feel like
my 40-year-old daughter

12:21.967 --> 12:24.300
is enjoying my retirement home
more than I am?

12:24.319 --> 12:25.818
Oh, you'll get there.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.637
I mean, there's water aerobics
tomorrow at 9:00.

12:27.730 --> 12:29.748
Try not to make jokes
about Charlie's Speedo.

12:29.899 --> 12:32.417
It covers less than my thong.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.977
Okay, let me be clear.

12:33.995 --> 12:36.087
These are my friends,
not yours.

12:36.314 --> 12:37.647
PATTY:
Hey, Kat,

12:37.740 --> 12:39.499
big sale on black licorice
at the Kroger.

12:39.651 --> 12:42.761
(laughs)
Get there before I do, Patty.

12:42.912 --> 12:44.262
(laughing)

12:44.489 --> 12:45.505
You were saying?

12:45.657 --> 12:48.157
How am I supposed to start
my new life here

12:48.176 --> 12:50.343
when you're always around
saying, "Look at me,

12:50.495 --> 12:52.345
look at me,
I have thinning hair, too."

12:52.497 --> 12:54.514
Why are you getting so upset?

12:54.666 --> 12:56.332
Why do you need
so much attention?

12:56.334 --> 12:57.758
What are you talking about?

12:57.778 --> 13:01.595
You're being... I believe
Carter calls it "thirsty."

13:01.648 --> 13:04.340
Wait, are you jealous?

13:04.359 --> 13:06.767
-That is ridiculous.
-Hold up.

13:06.861 --> 13:09.603
For the first time ever,
people like me

13:09.697 --> 13:12.849
more than they like you,
and it's driving you crazy.

13:12.942 --> 13:15.184
Oh, my goodness,
I'm popular.

13:15.203 --> 13:17.629
I'm one of the mean girls.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.447
You're driving me crazy.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.300
And by the look of
your panty lines,

13:22.451 --> 13:24.210
you got your thong on backwards.

13:24.379 --> 13:25.953
(gasps)

13:25.972 --> 13:28.556
Joke's on you,
I like it this way.

13:40.712 --> 13:41.969
Hey, man.

13:42.063 --> 13:44.047
What up, man?
You going to Kat's?

13:44.065 --> 13:45.323
Yeah. She wants to watch
<i> Mean Girls</i>

13:45.433 --> 13:46.807
and talk about
how popular she is.

13:46.827 --> 13:50.978
She thinks she's a Cady,
but she's really a Gretchen.

13:50.997 --> 13:51.830
What's up with you?

13:51.981 --> 13:53.147
Randi and I got into a fight

13:53.166 --> 13:54.607
about her engagement ring.

13:54.759 --> 13:55.725
I don't want to talk about it.

13:55.818 --> 13:57.168
Okay. Catch you later.

13:57.395 --> 13:58.578
Of course I want
to talk about it.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.246
I'm staring into a fire
drinking tea.

14:00.398 --> 14:02.489
Read the damn signs, man.

14:02.584 --> 14:05.251
All right.
And you're a Regina.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.420
How could she not
like the ring?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.422
It has a diamond and a ruby
shaped like hearts.

14:09.498 --> 14:11.591
You know how rare
those are in nature?

14:11.743 --> 14:12.909
I think it's awesome.

14:12.927 --> 14:15.502
The two hearts look like
butts touching.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.246
Or boobs touching.

14:17.265 --> 14:19.098
Or a butt and a boob touching.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.359
The best art is open
to interpretation.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.528
Too bad I didn't
propose to you.

14:23.755 --> 14:25.438
Well, if you ever do, make sure
it's at a football game,

14:25.532 --> 14:27.448
and it's on a Jumbotron.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.610
Listen, I know it sucks,
but it's not your fault.

14:30.762 --> 14:33.112
I tried so hard to make
something special for her.

14:33.264 --> 14:34.597
Like,<i> really</i> tried.

14:34.616 --> 14:36.449
Like, opened up
my Notes app tried.

14:36.601 --> 14:38.710
I know.
But at the end of the day,

14:38.861 --> 14:40.378
it's just a thing.

14:40.529 --> 14:44.007
What's really important
is that she loves you.

14:45.534 --> 14:48.720
I guess. I mean, why can't women
be simple like guys?

14:48.947 --> 14:51.556
All we want is sports,
beer and sex.

14:51.707 --> 14:53.707
If we're lucky,
all at the same time.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.786
Aka, the holy trinity.

14:56.879 --> 15:00.214
Well, tonight Kat's giving me
a rom-com, tea and feelings,

15:00.233 --> 15:03.050
aka the unholy trinity.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.528
Mm-mm-mm.

15:06.722 --> 15:08.631
Hey, what's all this?

15:08.724 --> 15:10.724
My friends from Valley Hills
are coming to the café.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.469
I thought I'd surprise them all
with ID bracelets.

15:13.562 --> 15:15.521
Mm. "Hi, I'm Charlie.

15:15.673 --> 15:19.825
"If found, I live at
2325 Valley Hills Lane.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.753
I fart when startled."

15:23.072 --> 15:25.314
My mom doesn't want me
going to Valley Hills,

15:25.333 --> 15:26.257
but she can't stop me from

15:26.484 --> 15:27.574
hanging out with
my friends here.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.078
Now, for Patty,
what's a nice way to say

15:31.172 --> 15:33.656
"truly dangerous driver"?

15:33.675 --> 15:35.341
Girl, just put "old."

15:35.493 --> 15:37.326
What's new with the ring sitch?

15:37.345 --> 15:40.513
Oh, Carter freaked out when
I told him I didn't like it.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.089
Oh. Well, do you want me
to talk to him?

15:42.108 --> 15:45.184
I'm popular now, and people
listen to popular people.

15:45.336 --> 15:46.686
No, I think I'm gonna
keep it.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.614
I mean, it's just a ring.
Who cares what it looks like?

15:49.841 --> 15:50.949
Plus, with a face like this,

15:51.025 --> 15:52.766
no one's gonna be looking
at my hands.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.619
-Preach!
-(laughs)

15:54.846 --> 15:57.680
KAT:
Oh, there they are. Hi.

15:57.773 --> 16:00.274
Welcome to Kat's Cat Café.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.461
Come on in, have a seat,
pet a cat.

16:03.612 --> 16:05.964
-Okay. Good kitty.
-(Kat chuckles)

16:06.132 --> 16:08.040
So, what do you want
to do today?

16:08.134 --> 16:11.544
We could play bridge,
hit a deli,

16:11.696 --> 16:12.712
have some soup.

16:12.864 --> 16:14.547
Oh, we could go
to a grocery store

16:14.699 --> 16:16.140
and pay with a check.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.700
Shouldn't we wait for Sheila?

16:17.719 --> 16:19.293
Maybe we can have some soup
while we wait.

16:19.387 --> 16:22.038
-Actually, my mother will not
be joining us today.
-What?

16:22.056 --> 16:23.648
-Why not?
-Well, you know, to be honest,

16:23.799 --> 16:26.726
I think she's a little jealous
that y'all like me

16:26.878 --> 16:28.544
more than you like her.

16:28.563 --> 16:30.137
It's not a contest.

16:30.231 --> 16:31.472
Oh, of course it's not.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.474
But if were,
do you know who would win?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.975
(announcer voice):
Kat Silver!

16:34.995 --> 16:36.552
(chanting):
Kat, Kat, Kat, Kat...

16:36.645 --> 16:38.070
Soup, soup, soup, soup.

16:38.223 --> 16:40.056
Y-You know,

16:40.074 --> 16:41.499
when you invited us,

16:41.576 --> 16:44.393
well, we just assumed
your mother would be here.

16:44.487 --> 16:46.562
Well, we don't need her
to have fun.

16:46.581 --> 16:48.231
You know, I'm here.
Soup, soup, soup!

16:48.249 --> 16:53.069
If this were soup, it'd be
Campbell's Extra-Awkward,

16:53.162 --> 16:54.587
Maybe we should
just head home.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.405
Yeah. You know,
your mother's our friend.

16:56.424 --> 16:58.665
We don't want
to make her feel bad.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.351
Oh, no. (chuckles)
Don't go.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.912
Hey, how about this,
we could go upstairs

17:03.005 --> 17:04.522
to my place
and watch<i> Mean Girls,</i>

17:04.673 --> 17:07.600
then we could make a Burn Book
and use a large font.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.677
Kat, you're a really sweet girl

17:10.772 --> 17:12.012
and we like you a lot,

17:12.032 --> 17:15.700
but hanging out with you
without your mom is...

17:15.851 --> 17:18.036
Borderline creepy.

17:18.187 --> 17:21.264
Yeah, we don't want
to get involved in family drama.

17:21.357 --> 17:22.356
Then why are you
and your sister

17:22.450 --> 17:23.766
still fighting over the hutch?

17:23.768 --> 17:25.710
My mother promised it to me.

17:25.937 --> 17:28.671
My sister doesn't even
collect plates.

17:29.941 --> 17:32.291
I-I collect plates.
You want to see?

17:32.368 --> 17:36.012
I just got a new one from...
Epcot.

17:39.117 --> 17:41.542
-(knock on door)
-(both scream)

17:41.636 --> 17:42.802
Damn!

17:42.929 --> 17:46.380
What are you throwing away,
rocks and sticks?

17:46.474 --> 17:47.957
Come in.

17:47.975 --> 17:49.625
I see you're wearing
your ring.

17:49.718 --> 17:52.295
Is it because of the sad poem
I left on your voicemail?

17:52.313 --> 17:54.906
"R is for the ring
I got you.

17:55.057 --> 17:57.408
A is for an ass
that don't quit."

17:57.635 --> 18:00.078
Actually, you left that
on the café voicemail,

18:00.229 --> 18:02.413
and now Kat thinks
it's okay to say.

18:02.565 --> 18:03.823
But...

18:03.975 --> 18:05.750
I want to keep the ring.

18:05.977 --> 18:09.903
You made it special for me,
and that's what's important.

18:10.072 --> 18:12.648
Oh, baby, you don't have
to keep it.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.592
I got you this.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.579
But it's empty.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.098
Wait, are you un-proposing?

18:20.249 --> 18:22.508
You can't. I already registered
for a NutriBullet.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.995
No, I want you to pick out
your own ring.

18:26.088 --> 18:28.922
-Really?
-Yes.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.666
You deserve to have one
that you love

18:30.759 --> 18:32.276
as much as I love you.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.280
Oh, I love you, too.
Thank you.

18:37.175 --> 18:38.841
But you can return
this one, right?

18:38.860 --> 18:40.601
No, but I got it insured.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.787
-So if they call,
you were mugged.
-(laughs)

18:42.938 --> 18:45.123
-Oh. You're so sweet.
-Yeah.

18:45.350 --> 18:46.682
You know what,
tonight we can do

18:46.684 --> 18:48.033
whatever you want.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.628
Maybe have a couple drinks,
watch the Louisville game.

18:50.779 --> 18:53.372
Maybe wear something edible.

18:53.524 --> 18:54.357
(gasps)

18:54.359 --> 18:57.468
-The holy trinity?
-Mm-hmm.

18:57.695 --> 19:00.096
I'd marry you right now
if I could.

And, uh, for reals, if you ever

I'm your first
and last call.

19:31.896 --> 19:33.229
Oh, you're not Hans.

19:33.247 --> 19:35.748
Why would you be drinking
with your massage therapist?

19:35.900 --> 19:38.992
Why are you asking questions
you don't want the answers to?

19:39.012 --> 19:42.738
-I came to apologize.
-Oh.

19:42.907 --> 19:44.907
For the way you've been acting,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.352
or for what you did
to my once-flawless body?

19:48.521 --> 19:51.672
Mikhail Baryshnikov's words,
not mine.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.691
I'm sorry.

19:53.768 --> 19:57.511
I really was coming here
for you, but I admit it.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.013
I got caught up
in all the attention.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.033
I'm not surprised
they like you.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.185
Why? Because people
who wear corrective footwear

20:05.205 --> 20:07.263
-are my people?
-No.

20:07.281 --> 20:08.855
Because you're bubbly,
you're infectious.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.449
You make them laugh.

20:10.601 --> 20:12.126
Oh.

20:13.454 --> 20:14.528
Thank you.

20:15.531 --> 20:16.881
I mean, to be fair,
you can use a lot of

20:17.032 --> 20:19.842
the same jokes every day;
they forget.

20:20.628 --> 20:23.387
It's just... I'm starting

20:23.614 --> 20:26.206
a whole new chapter
of my life here,

20:26.226 --> 20:31.020
and I didn't enjoy
being in your shadow.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.123
I guess I didn't
handle that very well.

20:34.141 --> 20:36.567
No, it's my fault.
Those are your friends.

20:36.644 --> 20:40.980
I-I need to leave you alone,
let you do your own thing.

20:41.132 --> 20:44.242
And you're gonna need these
a lot more than I do.

20:46.821 --> 20:50.081
I don't want you
to leave me alone.

20:50.308 --> 20:52.333
You're my daughter.

20:53.494 --> 20:56.979
Moving here has been
harder than I thought.

20:56.998 --> 21:00.316
And I need you to support me.

21:00.334 --> 21:01.333
Mother...

21:01.427 --> 21:03.052
