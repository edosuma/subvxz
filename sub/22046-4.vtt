08:53.432 --> 08:55.401
Nobody!
So [bleep] all of you.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.037
{\an7}All y'all fakers.
[bleep] all of you!

09:00.039 --> 09:01.974
- Oh, look at the guy swimming.
Look at the little guy swimming!

09:02.041 --> 09:03.709
- Oh, look right here,
right here, right here!

09:03.776 --> 09:05.945
- Oh, my God, his eyelashes.
- They're so beautiful.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.384
- Hello.
- Where we at?

09:11.450 --> 09:12.818
- Wait, are they not here?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.287
- I can't wait to be like,
"What's up?"

09:15.788 --> 09:17.523
- Wait a second.
- Oh, my God.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.625
- Holy [bleep].

09:24.497 --> 09:27.133
{\an8}- All of you. All y'all fakers.
[bleep] all of you.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.801
- Seriously not dealing
with this [bleep].

09:28.868 --> 09:30.336
- All of my friends [bleep]
left me,

09:30.403 --> 09:31.971
so [bleep] all of you.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.241
- Tya.
- No.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.043
- You're gonna get mad
because I walked

09:37.109 --> 09:39.712
the [bleep] downstairs to have
a mother[bleep] cigarette?

09:39.779 --> 09:42.782
This is all pathetic.
Like, it is so stupid.

09:42.848 --> 09:44.350
Like, just wait because
I 'm gonna start [bleep]

09:44.417 --> 09:46.352
bucking up and people
aren't gonna like that [bleep].

09:47.920 --> 09:49.722
- Right now is not the best--

09:49.789 --> 09:50.990
{\an3}and I understand you're
expressing yourself.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.425
{\an1}I respect it.
I'm just saying that like-

09:52.491 --> 09:54.093
{\an3}- I'm gonna say
the same [bleep] tomorrow.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.761
{\an1}- We can have this conversation
tomorrow when we have--

09:55.828 --> 09:57.096
{\an3}- I'll do that.
For you, I'll do that.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.798
{\an1}- But you yell. They yell.
It's, it's--

09:58.864 --> 10:00.266
{\an3}- Let me finish this Bagel Bite
and I swear to God

10:00.333 --> 10:01.968
I'll get de-mic'd
and I'll [bleep]--

10:02.034 --> 10:03.502
{\an1}- Bite this [bleep]. Bite this
[bleep]. Bite this [bleep].

10:03.569 --> 10:05.137
- No, no. No, no. Enjoy it.
- I'm gonna eat it.

10:05.204 --> 10:06.872
{\an8}I get where she's coming from.
I really do.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.274
{\an8}It's never fun to feel left out,

10:08.341 --> 10:10.009
<i>but I think</i>
<i>she kind of blows things</i>

10:10.076 --> 10:11.610
<i>out of proportion a little bit.</i>

10:11.677 --> 10:12.912
There was absolutely no ill will

10:12.979 --> 10:15.281
or intentions of excluding her.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.883
{\an1}I know you have a point of view,
and it's your point of view,

10:17.950 --> 10:19.485
{\an1}but I think you need to have
a conversation with them.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.854
- I left myself vulnerable
to get to know all of you.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.189
{\an1}- Shh, shh, can we talk?
Can we please talk?

10:23.255 --> 10:24.590
{\an3}- I never had friends
and the one time

10:24.657 --> 10:25.791
I feel like I have friends,

10:25.858 --> 10:27.893
all of you all [bleep] left me.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.595
I've been through
so much [bleep], Mike.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.130
- Tya, I believe you.
No, I do believe that.

10:31.197 --> 10:34.000
{\an3}- I swear to God,
I don't trust [bleep] nobody.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.736
{\an8}The whole reason why I came here
was to have friends.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.137
The action of them, like,

10:38.204 --> 10:40.973
not even having a second thought
to go get Tya,

10:41.040 --> 10:42.875
that really bothered me,
and I'm just like,

10:42.942 --> 10:44.910
"Wow, none of my roommates here

10:44.977 --> 10:47.179
gives a [bleep] about Tya,
like, even Theo."

10:47.246 --> 10:49.715
And it [bleep] cuts me
to the core

10:49.782 --> 10:51.817
that some of you
all [bleep] backstab me.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.185
{\an3}Some of you all talk
behind my back.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.054
{\an3}I have to go hide
in the confession room

10:55.121 --> 10:57.957
to find out something--
- Who is talking bad about you?

10:58.024 --> 10:59.325
{\an3}- Let me finish talking.
Let me finish talking.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.826
- Nobody's saying [bleep]
to you.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.762
{\an3}- Theo, please don't
make me hype up.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.829
- What the [bleep] hype up.
Hype up.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.097
- Please don't make me hype up.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.766
{\an3}I swear to God
I'll hype up, bro.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.434
{\an1}- Hey, I don't need you to fall,
I don't need you to fall.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.702
{\an3}- I don't give a [bleep]
if I fall right now.

11:09.769 --> 11:10.970
- T, T, who's backstabbing you.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.638
Let me know, please.
- All of you.

11:12.705 --> 11:13.939
{\an1}- How?

11:14.006 --> 11:17.143
- Mmm, pancakes.
- Isn't that so bomb?

11:19.545 --> 11:22.548
- Bisquick, girl. Bisquick.
- Literally, like,

11:22.615 --> 11:24.283
this is my shirt from now on.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.653
- I don't care at all.
- Seriously?

11:27.720 --> 11:28.921
- I'm eating pancakes.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.923
I don't give a [bleep].

11:30.990 --> 11:33.025
- I am genuinely hurt.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.428
- You serious? Go to sleep.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.130
<i>I think she's making</i>
<i>a huge deal over nothing.</i>

11:38.197 --> 11:40.766
{\an8}Man, just take your ass upstairs
and go to sleep.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.535
{\an8}Like, get over it.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.170
Man, I ain't got time
for this [bleep].

11:44.236 --> 11:46.639
I'm from Kankakee, Illinois.

11:46.705 --> 11:49.208
No one makes it
out of Kankakee, bro.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.710
- But you did.
- I did not fly

11:51.777 --> 11:54.146
thousands of miles to come here

11:54.213 --> 11:57.950
{\an1}and beef with a female
over something dumb.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.552
- I want you to get out
whatever you're feeling

11:59.618 --> 12:00.920
right now, brother.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.221
{\an3}But, like, I want to listen
to both sides,

12:02.288 --> 12:03.422
{\an3}and I want to be there
for both of you

12:03.489 --> 12:04.590
because T was there for me

12:04.657 --> 12:06.125
when I popped off
the first night.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.893
You were there for me when I
popped off the first night.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.361
You guys were both there for me.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.130
I'm sorry that everybody's
upset right now.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.399
{\an1}- But I have to live up there
with her, bro.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.401
- Hey, bro, you want to switch?
Take my bed.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.869
- No, I'm sleeping
on the couch tonight.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.270
{\an1}I ain't got time
for that [bleep], bro.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.172
I don't have time for that, bro.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.041
{\an1}I don't know
how y'all feel about T,

12:22.108 --> 12:23.676
{\an1}but I've been the one
to make sure her ass is good.

12:23.742 --> 12:27.980
{\an1}Her ass has felt that she
has not fit in this whole time,

12:28.047 --> 12:29.949
{\an1}and I've been the one
that talked to her

12:30.015 --> 12:32.084
every [bleep] time,

12:32.151 --> 12:35.421
{\an1}but you gonna flip [bleep]
at me?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.923
{\an1}[bleep] it.
I don't give a [bleep].

12:37.990 --> 12:39.525
{\an3}- Like, seriously,
it's so [bleep] annoying.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.060
Every night we're [bleep]
entertaining this [bleep].

12:41.127 --> 12:43.362
{\an3}Every other [bleep] night.
I'm done.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.668
- My sister, like,
I want the best for her.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.071
{\an8}But I also know how it is.
Like, I just don't know.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.173
{\an8}It's not gonna be
a fun time for me,

12:54.240 --> 12:55.174
because we're gonna sit there,

12:55.241 --> 12:56.976
and we're gonna fight,

12:57.042 --> 12:58.511
and then she'll get upset
with somebody else

12:58.577 --> 13:00.045
and, like, want me
to have her back,

13:00.112 --> 13:01.814
and I'm her older sister,
so I will.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.016
It's just, like, a sick cycle.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.951
- Don't worry about it.
- Just be the bigger person.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.653
- But I almost feel like
the bad person for, like,

13:07.720 --> 13:09.288
going into the house, though.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.856
- We know they're the bad guys.
- Well, clearly, you know.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.424
- Right, right.
- Like, we all stay strong

13:12.491 --> 13:14.693
and stick together,
we won't look like the bad guys.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.295
- Yeah.
- Ah, man.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.297
- I know, I'm actually
getting so sleepy.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.966
- I think I'm gonna head back
anyways. Yeah, I'm exhausted.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.903
- Day one!
- You guys all frickin' rock.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.571
- I love you all.
This is amazing.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.241
- Seriously, are we
all gonna come together,

13:29.308 --> 13:30.910
or are we all gonna [bleep]
go each other's--

13:30.976 --> 13:32.244
at each other's throats?

13:32.311 --> 13:33.646
{\an3}It's like petty ass [bleep]
[bleep]

13:33.712 --> 13:35.014
{\an3}everyone's [bleep]
making a big deal about.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.383
It's [bleep] pathetic.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.286
{\an8}[sighs]
My main concern is, like,

13:40.352 --> 13:41.620
<i>this twist is gonna happen.</i>

13:41.687 --> 13:44.456
The house drama
just adds double the drama.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.592
<i>We need to stick together</i>
<i>instead of fighting.</i>

13:46.659 --> 13:49.361
Like, it all needs to just,
like, stop.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.931
We're all here together
for a [bleep] reason.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.332
Everyone's trying to learn
one another.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.867
{\an3}- You got something to say
about tonight

13:54.934 --> 13:56.268
that has to deal with me,

13:56.335 --> 13:57.903
{\an3}I would love for you to wait
until tomorrow.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.438
Don't talk about [bleep]
about tonight

13:59.505 --> 14:01.540
unless I'm actually
in your presence.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.375
- Tya, you're gonna [bleep]
jump down my throat

14:03.442 --> 14:05.377
{\an3}and be like,
"[bleep] all of you all."

14:05.444 --> 14:07.546
Yo, I [bleep] walked downstairs
for a mother[bleep] cigarette.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.081
{\an3}I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were a [bleep] mom

14:09.148 --> 14:10.482
{\an3}to where I have to be like,
"Hey, mom,

14:10.549 --> 14:11.984
{\an3}I'm going out
for a [bleep] cigarette."

14:12.051 --> 14:13.752
{\an1}- I ain't trying
to be sarcastic and funny.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.254
{\an3}- No, it's not being sarcastic,
it's not being sarcastic.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.056
{\an1}- No one said I had
to be your [bleep] mom.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.425
{\an1}All I'm saying is
that if you're going to leave,

14:19.491 --> 14:20.993
like, at least, like,
let me know, my God.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.494
{\an1}If you see that
I'm the last person there,

14:22.561 --> 14:23.762
just [bleep] let me know.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.698
{\an3}- I was the [bleep] first
mother[bleep]

14:25.764 --> 14:29.468
to walk the [bleep] downstairs--
what do you want me to say?

14:29.535 --> 14:30.869
{\an1}- Okay. [bleep] cool. Great. I
don't have to [bleep] talk

14:30.936 --> 14:32.171
{\an1}to you--
I don't got to talk to you.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.839
{\an3}- Go ahead.
Honestly, at this point--

14:33.906 --> 14:36.842
- I don't give a [bleep] either.
Shut the [bleep] up, stupid ass.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.110
<i>- With the twist coming,</i>

14:38.177 --> 14:39.712
{\an8}I don't want to see fighting
no more.

14:39.778 --> 14:42.381

15:15.047 --> 15:17.216
{\an1}to make sure T ass is not
[bleep] mad.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.924
I met when I was here.

15:25.991 --> 15:31.530
You're the only person I really

15:36.535 --> 15:38.871
I'm gonna sleep up there with
you so you can just get over it.

15:38.937 --> 15:40.406

Let's talk about tonight.
How'd you feel about tonight?

16:13.372 --> 16:16.175
- I had fun.
- I had mad fun too.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.777
I think you sweated
all over me a lot.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.279
Not like a gross way,

16:20.346 --> 16:24.049
{\an1}but, like, I definitely
tasted your sweat on my face.

16:24.116 --> 16:28.387
- What? I was sweating on you?
- You were sweating all over me.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.788
No, I honestly had a lot of fun.

16:29.855 --> 16:34.059
I just--I think
you're absolutely adorable.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.694
- Aw, thank you.

{\an1}- I know.

literally the entire time--

36:35.226 --> 36:36.894

ignores me.

36:43.434 --> 36:44.669
I'm just annoyed.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.572
- I mean, you guys
just met each other,

36:47.638 --> 36:48.806
so we been together
for, like, two weeks.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.041
So, like,
we did the whole, like,

36:50.107 --> 36:51.776
we got comfortable
with each other

36:51.842 --> 36:53.311
{\an1}so now it's gonna be

Our team great, brother.

36:58.749 --> 37:00.117

from another mother, bro.

37:00.184 --> 37:01.385

for a day--

37:01.452 --> 37:02.687
you're already brothers?

37:02.753 --> 37:03.821
{\an3}- When you bump into another
individual

37:03.888 --> 37:05.423
that's real, bro, you know it,

37:05.489 --> 37:07.525
{\an3}and if you don't,
that's 'cause you fake.

37:07.592 --> 37:08.893
Sorry, you know what I'm saying?

37:08.960 --> 37:10.494
I done been through
real life situations.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.563

about a lot of [bleep].

37:12.630 --> 37:14.332
{\an1}So, are you saying
that Theo's not real then?

37:14.398 --> 37:15.666

- 'Cause you guys obviously

37:15.733 --> 37:17.068

37:17.134 --> 37:19.804
{\an3}- He beefed with the thought
of me, you feel me?

37:19.870 --> 37:21.505
I don't waste time
with peasant bull[bleep].

37:21.572 --> 37:23.841
- That's not peasant [bleep],
the story he told me about.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.309
{\an3}- I don't know
what story he told.

37:25.376 --> 37:26.744

37:26.811 --> 37:28.312
{\an3}- What about it,
him getting caught with weed?

37:28.379 --> 37:30.781
{\an8}- I'm not shocked that Mike is
instigating Kassius.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.217
{\an8}That's in his nature.
He's an instigator.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.252
- Don't do it.
I got a bad temper, bro,

37:35.319 --> 37:36.887
and I'm really--I'm really calm
with you right now, all right?

37:36.954 --> 37:38.322
{\an1}- I asked a question.
I asked a question.

37:38.389 --> 37:39.957
{\an3}- I'm really, really calm
with you, okay?

37:40.024 --> 37:41.425
{\an3}So don't dig a little deeper
than you want to go,

37:41.492 --> 37:42.960
you feel me?

37:43.027 --> 37:44.729
{\an3}'Cause I can release the demon
on you, you feel me?

37:44.795 --> 37:45.830
{\an1}- I can't ask
any more questions?

37:45.896 --> 37:47.298
{\an3}- Let me--
let me clarify this.

37:47.365 --> 37:50.635
When the police knock
on your door and say,

37:50.701 --> 37:52.570
"Do you want search and seizure,

37:52.637 --> 37:56.340
and I say no, and you say yes--

37:56.407 --> 37:58.142
- What did he say?
- Go ahead, say the bull[bleep].

37:58.209 --> 38:00.378
Let's hear it.
Let's start now. Go ahead.

38:00.444 --> 38:01.712
Get it out of the way, sir.

38:01.779 --> 38:02.880
Go ahead,
let's get it out the way.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.081
- What?
- Say what you gonna say.

38:04.148 --> 38:05.583
- So where was
the weed found at?

38:05.650 --> 38:06.817
- On "my side."

38:06.884 --> 38:08.619
- So anyway, this is how I know,
like,

38:08.686 --> 38:10.888
he got a bad brain

38:10.955 --> 38:12.757
and a bad memory
on this whole situation

38:12.823 --> 38:14.191
because I was trying to help
this kid the whole time.

38:14.258 --> 38:15.393
- You a [bleep] liar.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.861
{\an1}- I did that,
right hand on the Bible, bro.

38:16.927 --> 38:17.962
{\an3}- Oh, dig that grave.
He should [bleep]

38:18.029 --> 38:19.430
knock your ass down right now.

38:19.497 --> 38:20.898
- All right, Big Dad,
strike me dead if I'm

38:20.965 --> 38:22.533
lying now.
- You're a lying ass.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.935
- What I got to lie for, bro?
- Hey, hey, before you go--

38:25.002 --> 38:27.104
{\an8}before you go, before you go--
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.144
- Hey, hey, hey, before you go,
before you go.

38:33.210 --> 38:34.512
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Who asked the question?

38:34.578 --> 38:36.280
{\an1}- The way it got brought up is
he's like, "Yo,

38:36.347 --> 38:38.115
{\an1}real recognize real," like,
so then like, I was like,

38:38.182 --> 38:39.750
{\an1}"So then I guess you're saying
Theo's not real?"

38:39.817 --> 38:41.752
{\an1}And that's how this situation
got started.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.354
{\an7}I wasn't beefing.
You were beefing with me.

38:44.288 --> 38:45.389
- Go ahead. Say your story.

38:45.456 --> 38:46.924
- The story is this, bro:

38:46.991 --> 38:48.526
{\an3}when the police
come in the room,

38:48.592 --> 38:50.561
I told them "No,
you can't search my [bleep].

38:50.628 --> 38:52.630
Go get a warrant." He could have
said that same thing.

38:52.697 --> 38:55.132
I'm smart. My momma
has a criminal justice degree.

38:55.199 --> 38:58.836
Now he happens to have weed
in his protein thing.

38:58.903 --> 39:00.337
I wouldn't even put weed
in a protein jar.

39:00.404 --> 39:02.707
That's not smart at all,
okay, cool.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.809
They rip through my side.
They don't find [bleep].

39:04.875 --> 39:06.277
They rip through his side--

39:06.343 --> 39:07.812
{\an3}- How they gonna rip
through your side if you said

39:07.878 --> 39:09.113
you can't search your [bleep]?

39:09.180 --> 39:10.381
{\an1}- Bro, they still
searched my [bleep].

39:10.448 --> 39:11.515
- One. Keep going.

39:11.582 --> 39:12.950
- He not even making sense.
- Keep--

39:13.017 --> 39:14.118
- Anyway what I'm saying is
this, bro:

39:14.185 --> 39:15.486
the [bleep] was
in his possession.

39:15.553 --> 39:16.821
{\an3}- What the [bleep]
is this [bleep] saying?

39:16.887 --> 39:18.422
- The [bleep] was
in his possession.

39:18.489 --> 39:19.857
{\an3}- Bro, if you gonna be on here
trying to tell your story,

39:19.924 --> 39:21.025
{\an3}tell it
what it really [bleep] is.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.226
{\an1}- Bro, quit your [bleep]
talking, bro.

39:22.293 --> 39:23.761
{\an3}- Who the [bleep] is you
talking to?

39:23.828 --> 39:25.529
- I'm talking to you.
- Then do something, sir.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.331
- I ain't got [bleep] to do.
- And it's early.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.166
- I ain't got [bleep] to prove.
- Let's get this [bleep]

39:29.233 --> 39:30.768
out the way--do something.
- I ain't got [bleep] to prove.

39:30.835 --> 39:32.570
{\an3}- You wouldn't be here
unless it was because of me.

39:32.636 --> 39:34.371
- You wouldn't be here
because of him either, dude.

39:34.438 --> 39:35.773
- Okay, cool. You not [bleep].
- I'm just telling you

39:35.840 --> 39:36.974
straight up,
nobody would be here

39:37.041 --> 39:38.375
without anybody else.

39:38.442 --> 39:40.077
{\an3}- Word. Word.
Calm yourself, calm yourself.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.378
- So before you start talking--
- Me and him is blood.

39:41.445 --> 39:42.980
We gonna do this [bleep].
- Of course.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.348
{\an3}- But don't interject [bleep]
with this.

39:44.415 --> 39:45.850
{\an3}I don't want to hear [bleep]
you got to say

39:45.916 --> 39:47.384
{\an3}about [bleep]...
calm yourself.

39:47.451 --> 39:50.321
{\an8}- You wouldn't be here
because of him either, dude.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.056
- It doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter who moved in first.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.524
{\an1}It doesn't matter
who moved in first.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.025
- Was it him?
- It doesn't matter who moved in

39:55.092 --> 39:56.360
first, bro.
- Because you don't--

39:56.427 --> 39:58.028
- You don't even know
my situation,

39:58.095 --> 39:59.463
what the [bleep] happened
between us, all right?

39:59.530 --> 40:01.031
{\an3}- I don't give a [bleep]
about your situation.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.433
{\an9}First of all,
I didn't even ask you--

40:02.500 --> 40:04.769
{\an9}But who moved in first, Mike?
He did. Not him.

40:04.835 --> 40:06.303
{\an8}- It doesn't matter.

40:06.370 --> 40:08.405
{\an3}Wow, now you trying
to dick-ride Kim now?

40:08.472 --> 40:11.142
No. Get the [bleep] off of me.
You trying to dick-ride Kim now?

40:11.208 --> 40:13.344
- Oh, my God.
This is gonna be horrible.

40:13.410 --> 40:15.146
- [bleep] fight [bleep]?
What the [bleep] is up?

40:15.212 --> 40:17.181
You trying to dick-ride Kim?
You trying to dick-ride Kim?

40:17.248 --> 40:19.450
You trying to dick-ride Kim?
Let's go!

40:19.517 --> 40:21.585
No, [bleep]. No, [bleep].

40:21.652 --> 40:23.154
Where's Kim at?

40:23.220 --> 40:25.222
- Relax. You're very immature.
You're very...

40:25.289 --> 40:27.191
- Lay off them boys. Cool.
- Unsanitary.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.493
I feel bad for you.
It's all good though.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.329
- I think it's the OGs versus
the new kids on the block.

40:32.396 --> 40:34.131
- It is literally
a [bleep] storm.

40:34.198 --> 40:36.033
- Hey, yo, yo--
- Yo!

40:36.100 --> 40:37.568
[bleep]. [bleep].
