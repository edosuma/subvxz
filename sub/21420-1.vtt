00:57.308 --> 00:59.441
It'll be okay.

03:06.703 --> 03:09.638
Please don't forget to separate
the whites from the darks.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.440
Why? You didn't like your bleached out shirt?

03:12.408 --> 03:13.475
Daddy's funny, isn't he?

03:15.079 --> 03:18.580
Hey, so I convinced Mike
to give me Sunday off.

03:18.582 --> 03:20.882
I figured maybe we could go out,
do something fun?

03:20.884 --> 03:23.518
You know, I worked that overtime this week.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.721
So I figured we could afford
a babysitter for a few hours.

03:25.723 --> 03:27.522
What do you think?

03:27.524 --> 03:29.791
That sounds great, but I was
gonna see about picking up

03:29.793 --> 03:33.095
some weekend shifts again.

03:33.097 --> 03:36.765
Oh, no!

03:38.502 --> 03:39.935
I'll get them.

03:41.637 --> 03:45.974
Can you see it? My vision's gotten so poor.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.543
It's the last of my change.

03:51.547 --> 03:54.516
Here you go. It didn't go far.

03:54.518 --> 03:56.118
Thank you.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.492
It's not a big deal.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.161
I'll hang dry them at home.

04:10.566 --> 04:13.668
- Hello?
- Adam?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.470
Jake.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.439
Adam, it's about mom.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.474
What about her?

04:19.476 --> 04:22.878
- Have you heard from her?
- No, why, what's going on?

04:22.880 --> 04:25.414
She's missing.

04:25.416 --> 04:27.582
Missing? What do you mean missing?

04:27.584 --> 04:28.850
Nobody's heard from her.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.085
We just had to file a police report.

04:30.087 --> 04:33.021
Oh, my God.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.556
You need to come home.

04:34.558 --> 04:36.758
Bring Beth and Emma, please.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.727
Okay.

04:38.729 --> 04:42.731
You know I wouldn't bother you
if it wasn't serious.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.966
Come stay at mom's with us.
We'll figure this out together.

07:24.093 --> 07:27.662
Hey, sweetie. All right.

07:27.664 --> 07:28.863
Hi, sweetie.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.332
- Got her?
- Hi, sweetie.

07:30.334 --> 07:32.968
Yeah, can you get the door?

07:32.970 --> 07:35.170
Hi, baby.

07:35.172 --> 07:39.341
You're okay. I know, it was a long drive.

07:39.343 --> 07:42.177
- Oh!
- Is she okay?

07:42.179 --> 07:45.914
Yeah.

07:45.916 --> 07:49.250
You can go in there, honey, I'm with you.

07:49.252 --> 07:51.052
I know.

07:55.992 --> 07:57.926
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:06.869 --> 08:09.371
Hiya, Beth, I'm so glad
you guys could make it.

08:09.373 --> 08:12.741
I'm just so sorry about the circumstances.

08:14.377 --> 08:17.112
Oh, my God. She is so cute.

08:17.114 --> 08:19.247
- Hi.
- Thank you.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.183
You guys come in, please.

08:23.786 --> 08:25.920
Hi. I'm so glad to finally meet you.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.298
Hey.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.871
She's adorable.

08:49.979 --> 08:52.414
Are you not gonna say good-bye?

08:52.416 --> 08:54.416
Oh, oh, you want money.
You want money, right?

08:54.418 --> 08:57.185
- Mom, please.
- Yeah, you always want money.

08:57.187 --> 08:59.187
Here. Take it. Take it. It's all I got left.

09:01.057 --> 09:04.426
What do you want from me?

09:04.428 --> 09:05.860
Just go.

09:07.430 --> 09:09.330
Go!

09:09.332 --> 09:11.132
Get out!

09:17.006 --> 09:19.074
It's good to see you, Adam.

09:22.244 --> 09:24.179
Yeah, you too.

09:25.748 --> 09:28.450
I like the beard.

09:28.452 --> 09:30.151
Thanks.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.487
And thanks for helping Jake
put all this together.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.023
I really appreciate it.

09:35.025 --> 09:37.192
Yeah, we do what we can.

09:45.868 --> 09:47.335
How you doing? I'm Jeff.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.804
This is my wife, Sarah.
This is our friend, Candice.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.474
Nice meeting you guys.
I appreciate everybody being here.

09:52.476 --> 09:56.778
It's so great to meet you.
We've heard so much about you.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.413
Your mom will be okay.

10:00.116 --> 10:02.083
Uh, thank you, guys.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.925
So, these are all mom's friends, or...?

10:10.927 --> 10:13.895
Yeah, friends from gateways.

10:13.897 --> 10:15.530
Yeah, everybody here's been a real help.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.232
They're going door-to-door, asking questions

10:17.234 --> 10:19.934
- on their own, even.
- Good.

10:19.936 --> 10:22.137
Anything we can do to help.

10:24.306 --> 10:26.841
We haven't met yet. I'm Lawrence.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.010
Adam.

10:29.012 --> 10:30.078
I know.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.881
I've heard a lot about you.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.250
- Oh, hey. Here you go.
- Thank you.

10:35.252 --> 10:37.952
Hi, I'm Glenda.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.888
It was nice meeting you.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.891
Yes, you were the last one to see mom, right?

10:42.893 --> 10:45.927
That's right. It was Monday after the group,

10:45.929 --> 10:48.163
and Evette and I went
and grabbed a bite to eat,

10:48.165 --> 10:51.833
and, well, she said she was going home.

10:51.835 --> 10:54.402
What about the police? What are they doing?

10:54.404 --> 10:57.572
Well, they were just here. I mean,
they're doing everything they can.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.542
Your mom and I were very close,

11:00.544 --> 11:03.545
and I live just down the street,

11:03.547 --> 11:06.848
and, well, my door's always open.

11:19.128 --> 11:20.195
- Thank you.
- All right.

11:20.197 --> 11:21.563
Thanks for coming, guys.

11:21.565 --> 11:23.565
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

11:23.567 --> 11:25.233
- Good night.
- Good night, Jeff. Thank you.

11:25.235 --> 11:26.501
You have a special little girl.

11:26.503 --> 11:27.902
Thank you.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.912
We'll find her. Don't worry.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.314
Thank you.

11:39.316 --> 11:41.216
Thanks, Lawrence.

11:42.418 --> 11:43.885
Seems like a nice kid.

11:43.887 --> 11:46.054
Yeah, he is.

11:46.056 --> 11:48.122
Been kinda like a brother to me.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.063
It's good to have you back, man.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.618
Hey, you're all set?

12:16.620 --> 12:19.187
Yeah, thanks.

12:19.189 --> 12:21.389
Oh, God, she's adorable.

12:21.391 --> 12:24.225
Mmm, she's fussy.

12:24.227 --> 12:26.561
I thought she'd sleep more in the car.

12:26.563 --> 12:27.929
We've seen your pictures online.

12:27.931 --> 12:31.199
God, she's getting so big!

12:31.201 --> 12:34.903
Hi, Emma. It's so good
to finally meet you in person.

12:36.373 --> 12:39.240
Who were all those people
that came over earlier?

12:39.242 --> 12:42.443
Uh, friends. Mostly people from gateways...

12:42.445 --> 12:45.513
uh, the bereavement group
that Evette was part of.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.582
After the fires, the whole town went.

12:47.584 --> 12:50.919
It was like everyone felt like
they lost something,

12:50.921 --> 12:52.987
or someone.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.423
Jake and I go, too. It's a safe environment.

12:57.092 --> 12:59.661
It's like AA without all the steps.

12:59.663 --> 13:01.596
Or the smokers.

13:01.598 --> 13:04.365
I'm sure it's good
for everyone to talk about it.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.068
Yeah, hmm.

13:15.077 --> 13:16.577
She reminds me of Sean.

13:23.118 --> 13:26.454
Do you miss him?

13:26.456 --> 13:29.057
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

13:29.059 --> 13:30.491
no, it's okay. Of course we do.

13:30.493 --> 13:32.560
I'm sorry for even bringing that up.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.561
Really, don't worry about it.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.730
Um...

13:35.732 --> 13:39.467
I'm just really glad I got him
for the time I did.

13:39.469 --> 13:42.103
He was a blessing.

13:42.105 --> 13:44.739
Well, I'm glad to see you're doing all right.

13:44.741 --> 13:49.444
Yeah, life has a way
of making everything work out.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.581
Doesn't it? Yeah.

14:03.192 --> 14:05.259
9-1-1, what's the address of the emergency?

14:05.261 --> 14:08.396
There's a fire at my place,
at 108 cozen canyon road.

14:08.398 --> 14:11.432
- 118?
- No! 108. Please come now!

14:11.434 --> 14:12.600
Is everybody out of the house?

14:12.602 --> 14:14.068
No, my brother's out of the house.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.403
My mother's out of the house,

14:15.405 --> 14:17.405
but my father's stuck inside the house.

14:17.407 --> 14:18.740
Where inside the house?

14:18.742 --> 14:20.641
I don't know! We can't get in.

14:20.643 --> 14:22.577
Adam!

14:32.354 --> 14:34.389
Beth.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.764
Beth?

15:17.733 --> 15:20.334
Beth, what are you doing?

15:26.475 --> 15:29.077
They can fix us. They'll fix everything.

15:29.079 --> 15:31.245
They can fix this. They'll fix everything.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.815
They can fix this. They'll fix everything.

15:33.817 --> 15:37.185
They can fix this. They'll fix everything.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.288
They can fix this. They'll fix everything.

15:40.290 --> 15:42.557
They can fix this. They'll fix everything.

15:42.559 --> 15:45.093
They can fix this. They'll fix everything.

15:45.095 --> 15:47.695
They can fix this. They'll fix everything.

16:31.141 --> 16:34.542
So tell me, how's life in Redding?

16:34.544 --> 16:36.744
It's okay.

16:36.746 --> 16:40.181
I grew up there, so not too exciting.

16:40.183 --> 16:43.217
Do you get to travel much?

16:43.219 --> 16:45.620
I actually haven't left town
since we had Emma.

16:45.622 --> 16:48.256
Oh, God, some vacation, huh? I'm sorry.

16:53.729 --> 16:56.330
You know, maybe the four of us
could go on a trip sometime.

16:56.332 --> 16:58.466
Some place exotic?

16:58.468 --> 17:00.168
Yeah, maybe.

17:04.940 --> 17:08.309
- I love your necklace.
- Really? Thank you.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.678
You know, I can't ever decide
if it's too much.

17:10.680 --> 17:14.915
No, it's beautiful.

17:14.917 --> 17:16.617
Yeah, I bet this would look good on you.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.587
Here, try it on.

17:21.690 --> 17:23.290
All right.

17:37.673 --> 17:39.607
Honestly, it looks better on you.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.511
Really?

17:43.513 --> 17:45.646
Yeah, you should keep it.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.382
What? No, I couldn't.

17:48.384 --> 17:51.219
Keep it. I have one just like it.

18:27.657 --> 18:29.657
Hi, Glenda.

18:29.659 --> 18:31.892
Hi. Hello.

18:31.894 --> 18:34.795
She looks even more beautiful today.

18:36.833 --> 18:40.368
You're the most beautiful
girl in the world, Emma.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.743
Hello, darling.

18:48.745 --> 18:51.879
Glenda, we brought the fliers here for you.

18:54.483 --> 18:56.517
How many can I have?

18:56.519 --> 18:59.887
Oh, there's like a dozen in there,
but we can always get you more.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.757
I just wish we knew where she was.

19:02.759 --> 19:04.825
I'm s...

19:04.827 --> 19:06.927
I can't imagine why she would leave us,

19:06.929 --> 19:11.899
and we... we do everything
together after my son died,

19:11.901 --> 19:15.303
and...

19:17.673 --> 19:21.442
You could come to gateways, too, you know?

19:21.444 --> 19:23.878
And pass these out.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.914
Or just sit in.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.984
We'll do that for sure, thanks.

19:29.986 --> 19:31.485
What do you know about tom?

19:31.487 --> 19:34.088
Mom's ex-boyfriend?

19:34.090 --> 19:36.757
We talked to him.

19:36.759 --> 19:40.394
He doesn't know anything.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.430
Jake and I will go talk to him.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.764
Thanks.

19:48.570 --> 19:51.605
- It's a nice ride.
- Oh, you like it?

19:51.607 --> 19:55.409
I feel like it's a little ostentatious.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.845
Like, too flashy or something? I don't know.

19:57.847 --> 19:59.780
Must have been pricy, no?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.682
Yeah, well, I've worked hard
to get to this place.

20:01.684 --> 20:04.452
Sacrificed a lot.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.455
I'm afraid to see what
your new house looks like.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.624
I could get you into my work.
We're looking for good people.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.426
I don't even have a college degree.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.128
Eh, you're my brother. It's fine.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.498
Unless you'd prefer breaking
your back outside everyday.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.735
Hey, it's an honest living.

20:20.737 --> 20:23.704
You just don't want to work for me, right?

20:23.706 --> 20:26.974
Look, let's not get into this
right now, all right?

20:26.976 --> 20:29.377
Let's just focus on finding mom, please.

21:12.554 --> 21:14.455
Christy?

21:36.645 --> 21:37.912
Christy?

22:54.589 --> 22:56.857
Tom! Tom!

24:05.928 --> 24:07.695
What are you doing here?

24:07.697 --> 24:10.064
- We're just looking for tom.
- What for?

24:10.066 --> 24:12.032
We need to talk to him about our mother.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.667
Yeah, who's that?

24:13.669 --> 24:16.036
Evette Morris?

24:16.038 --> 24:19.773
Oh, yeah. I liked her.

24:19.775 --> 24:21.942
She was real pretty.

24:23.979 --> 24:25.813
Well, thank you.

27:37.172 --> 27:39.206
Jake Morris.

27:39.208 --> 27:42.242
And you must be the other one.
The one who left.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.479
Adam, right?

27:45.481 --> 27:49.917
First man risen from dust.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.052
What are you doing here, boys?

27:52.054 --> 27:55.189
Just wanted to talk to you about our mom.

27:55.191 --> 27:58.826
Me and evette used to spend
a lot of time together.

27:58.828 --> 28:01.562
Who do you think Johnny law
came calling up first

28:01.564 --> 28:03.330
when she turned up missing?

28:03.332 --> 28:06.233
Yeah, sure. Makes sense. Of course they did.

28:06.235 --> 28:08.168
Well, uh, sorry to have bothered you.

28:08.170 --> 28:10.571
No, no. We wanted to talk to you in person,

28:10.573 --> 28:13.040
- See if maybe you...
- Maybe what?

28:13.042 --> 28:14.508
What are you looking for?

28:16.344 --> 28:18.011
We're just trying to find our mother.

28:18.013 --> 28:20.280
She's been missing for days.
We're just worried.

28:20.282 --> 28:23.317
I told you, I haven't talked to her.

28:23.319 --> 28:25.586
Why did you guys stop dating?

28:25.588 --> 28:27.421
What does that matter?

28:27.423 --> 28:29.356
Ever think your mom just ran away?

28:29.358 --> 28:31.592
Evette was a fucking whacko.

28:31.594 --> 28:32.626
What did you say?

28:32.628 --> 28:35.429
Whoa. Easy, Seth.

28:35.431 --> 28:37.898
I think you fellas should leave.

28:37.900 --> 28:41.935
I'm sure if you were in our situation,
you'd understand where we're coming from.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.371
I have a business to run here, boys.

28:44.373 --> 28:46.473
If you wanna talk about your mommy,

28:46.475 --> 28:50.344
go talk to her crazy friends.

28:50.346 --> 28:52.112
What friends? Who?

28:52.114 --> 28:54.548
These friends right here, behind you.

28:54.550 --> 28:59.086
We're thinking it's time for you to go.

29:00.456 --> 29:01.922
Come on.

29:08.363 --> 29:10.530
Little punks.

29:12.467 --> 29:14.434
I didn't tell you this, but mom had

29:14.436 --> 29:16.470
a lot of trouble last year.

29:16.472 --> 29:18.639
I even had to check her
into a clinic at one point

29:18.641 --> 29:21.475
because she wasn't stable.

29:21.477 --> 29:23.911
What do you mean, "wasn't stable"?

29:23.913 --> 29:26.246
Well, the doctor said
it was a suicide attempt,

29:26.248 --> 29:27.447
but she denied it.

29:27.449 --> 29:29.283
Wait, what?

29:29.285 --> 29:31.218
What was a suicide attempt?

29:31.220 --> 29:33.654
She was mixing pills and alcohol.

29:33.656 --> 29:35.589
How could you not tell me this?

29:35.591 --> 29:37.491
She got really depressed after you left,

29:37.493 --> 29:39.293
and it kind of got worse and worse.

29:39.295 --> 29:42.329
I just didn't want to make you
feel guilty, you know?

29:42.331 --> 29:44.231
How could you not call me?

29:44.233 --> 29:47.067
I mean, is she losing her mind or something?

29:47.069 --> 29:49.069
Well, she knew you had a lot going on,

29:49.071 --> 29:50.971
like with the pregnancy and everything,

29:50.973 --> 29:55.008
and she just didn't want to worry you, so...

29:55.010 --> 29:57.010
I didn't tell you. I should have.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.378
I'm sorry.

30:22.470 --> 30:25.706
Hey...

30:25.708 --> 30:29.643
Come here. Come here. Come here.

30:29.645 --> 30:32.379
What's wrong? You okay?

30:32.381 --> 30:34.748
You okay?

30:34.750 --> 30:38.185
What's wrong?

31:15.423 --> 31:18.025
Watchers.

31:37.211 --> 31:40.280
Hey. I just fed Emma. She's finally asleep.

31:51.726 --> 31:54.127
Their life seems a lot easier than ours, huh?

31:57.665 --> 31:59.166
What's that supposed to mean?

32:02.570 --> 32:06.073
I know money can't buy happiness,
but it sure solves a lot of problems.

32:12.580 --> 32:14.481
Are you not happy anymore?

32:16.584 --> 32:18.452
I am.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.155
You know this year's been hard,

32:22.157 --> 32:23.623
ever since we had Emma.

32:23.625 --> 32:26.426
Look, I know we don't have
everything they do,

32:26.428 --> 32:28.161
but I'm trying.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.833
It's not your fault.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.170
Beth.

33:07.668 --> 33:09.402
Adam.

33:12.340 --> 33:13.907
It's me.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.209
Angela?

33:16.211 --> 33:17.878
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry,

33:17.880 --> 33:19.880
- I didn't recognize you.
- It's okay. It's okay.

33:19.882 --> 33:21.348
- I know.
- Are you okay?

33:21.350 --> 33:23.350
- Do you wanna come in?
- I shouldn't.

33:23.352 --> 33:25.318
I just needed to see you.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.521
I need to warn you.

33:27.523 --> 33:29.656
Warn me about what?

33:29.658 --> 33:31.458
Have you met those people yet?

33:31.460 --> 33:32.826
Your mom's friends?

33:32.828 --> 33:34.394
Yeah, last night.

33:34.396 --> 33:35.729
Lawrence?

33:37.532 --> 33:39.166
The kid, right?

33:40.268 --> 33:42.569
What about him?

33:42.571 --> 33:45.672
Help isn't what they offer.

33:45.674 --> 33:48.175
That place, and those people,
and Lawrence, especially,

33:48.177 --> 33:51.478
just don't trust them.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.480
Why wouldn't we trust them?

34:00.454 --> 34:02.822
He's a monster.

34:07.828 --> 34:10.630
Find me.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.563
Hey, man, wanna give me a hand
with the groceries out of the car?

34:46.766 --> 34:48.601
Wanna tell me what was really
going on with mom?

34:51.339 --> 34:53.540
What do you mean?

34:53.542 --> 34:56.275
Dolls with their eyes blacked out.

34:56.277 --> 34:59.746
Suicide attempts.

34:59.748 --> 35:02.816
Gateways.

35:02.818 --> 35:05.785
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

35:05.787 --> 35:08.655
Tell me everything.

35:08.657 --> 35:10.390
What do you want me to say?

35:10.392 --> 35:12.559
I don't know where she is.

35:12.561 --> 35:13.727
How could you not tell me

35:13.729 --> 35:15.362
our mother tried to kill herself?

35:15.364 --> 35:17.564
You have a nice history
of keeping stuff from me.

35:17.566 --> 35:19.432
Is there anything else I should know?

35:19.434 --> 35:22.002
Why would I tell you? Huh?
You left after the fires.

35:22.004 --> 35:24.471
Would you have come back?

35:24.473 --> 35:25.872
Of course I didn't tell you about mom.

35:25.874 --> 35:29.376
I handled it on my own, like I always do.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.444
Why would I even bother you
or involve you at all?

35:31.446 --> 35:33.013
You're part of the reason she got this way.

35:34.815 --> 35:36.650
Really?

35:36.652 --> 35:37.951
You know, you got a lot of balls

35:37.953 --> 35:39.619
putting this on me after what you've done.

35:39.621 --> 35:41.288
You think I would want to live here

35:41.290 --> 35:43.490
next to you and Christy after what you did?

35:43.492 --> 35:46.593
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that was for me?

35:46.595 --> 35:49.029
What, do you think it was just
easy for us or something?

35:49.031 --> 35:51.931
It's not like I planned this to happen.

35:51.933 --> 35:54.067
- That's bullshit.
- God, I've told you,

35:54.069 --> 35:56.569
nothing happened while you two were together.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.471
I told you this.

35:58.473 --> 36:01.708
Either way, man, you don't do shit like this.

36:01.710 --> 36:04.044
- You knew I loved her.
- Loved her.

36:04.046 --> 36:05.912
Did you? Hmm?

36:05.914 --> 36:07.647
You dated for what, not even a year?

36:07.649 --> 36:10.884
I've been married to her for four years.

36:10.886 --> 36:12.052
How are you still holding this against me?

36:12.054 --> 36:14.054
You still hung up on her or what?

36:17.725 --> 36:19.426
I'm glad you're happy.

36:21.696 --> 36:23.396
I, um...

36:23.398 --> 36:24.731
I just wanted to...

36:24.733 --> 36:26.566
I just wanted to start by apologizing

36:26.568 --> 36:28.601
to all of you. I, uh...

36:28.603 --> 36:30.437
I know I fought a lot of this at first,

36:30.439 --> 36:33.506
but the thought of losing somebody

36:33.508 --> 36:35.875
was just so horrific to me.

36:35.877 --> 36:37.544
The only guilt that I had

36:37.546 --> 36:41.414
is because I wasn't
as strong as all of you...

36:43.818 --> 36:44.478
Or my wife.

36:47.922 --> 36:52.359
And I kept thinking to myself,
did I... did I miss something?

36:53.427 --> 36:56.129
Did I do something wrong?

36:56.131 --> 36:58.098
It was like the light was never clear to me.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.901
And it's taken some time, but we, uh...

37:04.605 --> 37:06.072
we're finally happy now.

37:10.578 --> 37:12.612
Your grief is your own,

37:12.614 --> 37:15.615
and no one else can tell you
when it's time to move on,

37:15.617 --> 37:18.118
but you can find relief in knowing

37:18.120 --> 37:22.122
that those who have moved on
have found a better place,

37:22.124 --> 37:25.592
a clean slate.

37:25.594 --> 37:29.896
I promise you, you will get there.

37:29.898 --> 37:31.798
You can start over, too.

37:36.971 --> 37:38.805
I'm so proud of you.

37:42.543 --> 37:46.513
You both have given up so much,

37:46.515 --> 37:50.817
but think of the rewards you'll receive

37:50.819 --> 37:52.752
of the life now unfolding in front of you.

37:57.491 --> 38:01.694
Whenever you feel weak, remember...

38:01.696 --> 38:03.997
This will ground you.

38:03.999 --> 38:07.600
It's a symbol of strength and regrowth.

38:20.781 --> 38:23.516
- Glad you came.
- Oh, hi.

38:23.518 --> 38:26.953
- Oh, my gosh, so cute.
- Thank you.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.791
That was a wonderful speech.

38:31.793 --> 38:34.060
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

38:34.062 --> 38:36.896
Is there something you're not
telling me about my mom?

38:36.898 --> 38:38.498
I told you everything I know.

38:38.500 --> 38:43.536
- Watchers.
- Watchers?

38:43.538 --> 38:45.772
My mom had an interesting doll collection.

38:45.774 --> 38:49.008
Oh! Her babies.

38:49.010 --> 38:52.846
Evette just loved those old
porcelain antique dolls.

38:52.848 --> 38:54.514
Really?

38:54.516 --> 38:58.084
She blacked out their eyes,
tore off their clothes,

38:58.086 --> 39:00.153
and wrote watchers on all of them.

39:00.155 --> 39:02.489
Do you know anything about that?

39:02.491 --> 39:05.492
Oh, evette.

39:05.494 --> 39:08.495
Let's push our energy towards
Evette's return.

39:08.497 --> 39:10.930
This is a place of peace,

39:10.932 --> 39:14.234
safety, and understanding.

39:14.236 --> 39:15.869
We support each other,

39:15.871 --> 39:18.671
and right now we're in support
of finding evette.

39:18.673 --> 39:21.508
You and Beth are always welcome here, Adam.

39:21.510 --> 39:24.777
You're welcome anytime.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.513
Shouldn't you be in school?

39:38.058 --> 39:40.793
So, how about a glass of wine?

39:40.795 --> 39:42.829
I brought one from home.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.668
I just shouldn't drink because of Emma.

39:48.670 --> 39:51.771
Oh, come on.
We're not going anywhere tonight.

39:51.773 --> 39:53.573
Let's relax.

39:53.575 --> 39:55.842
Do something for yourself for a change.

40:06.854 --> 40:08.121
Wow.

40:25.606 --> 40:29.576
Wouldn't you like to have
anything you've ever wanted?

40:29.578 --> 40:32.078
We're okay.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.647
We get by.

40:34.649 --> 40:39.652
Yeah, but that doesn't
stop you from wanting...

40:41.088 --> 40:44.891
Craving,

40:44.893 --> 40:48.962
needing?

40:48.964 --> 40:50.964
No.

40:53.167 --> 40:55.201
So, I heard you got a chance to talk

40:55.203 --> 40:56.936
to the girls from gateways.

40:58.806 --> 41:00.173
- Hi.
- What are we having?

41:00.175 --> 41:04.777
Your favorite. Here.

41:04.779 --> 41:07.914
Oh, thank you.

41:10.851 --> 41:12.819
You okay?

41:12.821 --> 41:15.021
Yeah.

41:15.023 --> 41:18.791
I'm so glad I have you.

41:18.793 --> 41:20.660
I'm glad I have you, too.

41:37.778 --> 41:40.880
- Hi, this is evette.
- Leave a message.

42:02.971 --> 42:05.405
Mom. Mom!

42:21.321 --> 42:24.057
Hi, this is evette. Leave a message.

42:39.339 --> 42:41.474
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm gonna take a drive.

42:41.476 --> 42:43.242
What, this late?

42:43.244 --> 42:46.179
Look, tom knows something,
and I wanna know what he knows.

42:46.181 --> 42:47.880
- You want company? I'll...
- No.

44:06.860 --> 44:08.361
Hey, you all right?

44:08.363 --> 44:11.864
Yeah, I'm just getting ready for bed.

44:11.866 --> 44:15.868
- Wow, you've bounced back quickly.
- Oh, thanks.

44:15.870 --> 44:17.904
I'm almost back to my pre-baby weight.

44:17.906 --> 44:20.907
Oh, God, I bet Adam can't keep
his hands off you.

44:20.909 --> 44:23.276
I don't know.

44:23.278 --> 44:25.978
That would be nice.

44:25.980 --> 44:31.284
I think since having Emma,
things have changed.

44:31.286 --> 44:33.152
It's different.

44:35.856 --> 44:37.390
And we're different.

44:44.031 --> 44:45.565
You know, you can have whatever you want

44:45.567 --> 44:47.333
if you really want it.

44:51.071 --> 44:52.405
Beth...

44:55.242 --> 44:58.578
Anyone can have anything.

44:58.580 --> 45:00.346
But no one can have everything.

47:06.473 --> 47:07.673
Adam.

47:09.609 --> 47:13.112
Breaking into my place?

47:13.114 --> 47:16.048
Think I got her here?

47:16.050 --> 47:19.618
Have the police get a warrant.

47:19.620 --> 47:21.354
No.

47:21.356 --> 47:24.123
Think you're hard, boy?

47:24.125 --> 47:26.726
There's things in this town
all kinds of harder.

47:26.728 --> 47:31.597
What's that supposed to mean? What things?

47:31.599 --> 47:34.300
This town is full of crazy.

47:34.302 --> 47:39.538
You should be harassing Glenda, not me.

47:39.540 --> 47:41.774
Are you one of them?

47:41.776 --> 47:43.142
What?

47:43.144 --> 47:44.377
Are you one of them?

47:44.379 --> 47:47.313
- One of who?
- Are you one of them?

47:54.688 --> 47:56.389
- Jake, what the hell!
- You all right?

47:56.391 --> 47:58.090
Yes, I'm all right. Why would you do that?

47:58.092 --> 47:59.492
He was about to cut your head off.

47:59.494 --> 48:01.127
Thank God I followed you. Come on, let's go.

48:01.129 --> 48:04.196
Wait a second! Wait a second.

48:04.198 --> 48:06.232
You don't think he's dead, do you?

48:06.234 --> 48:08.768
No, no. I just... I just hit him.

48:12.707 --> 48:14.340
He's alive.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.277
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I'm calling him an ambulance.

48:18.279 --> 48:20.546
Oh, okay. All right.
Think about what you're doing.

48:20.548 --> 48:22.314
Think about what you just did.

48:22.316 --> 48:25.551
I'm sorry. You would be lying there
right now, if I hadn't shown up.

48:25.553 --> 48:27.186
He's fine. He's not dead. He's gonna wake up.

48:27.188 --> 48:31.057
Either way, he's gonna wake up and he's
gonna tell them that he saw me here.

48:31.825 --> 48:33.359
He reeks of booze.

48:33.361 --> 48:34.660
He's not gonna remember
what the hell happened.

48:34.662 --> 48:36.429
Shit.

48:38.198 --> 48:39.498
Come on!

48:42.836 --> 48:46.172
Shh, shh, shh.

50:57.771 --> 50:59.205
What are you doing?

50:59.207 --> 51:00.940
- I think I just saw mom.
- What? Where?

51:00.942 --> 51:02.608
Up in Glenda's window in that room.

51:02.610 --> 51:04.510
Well, I think you're seeing things, man.

51:04.512 --> 51:06.212
- Am I?
- Probably just Glenda.

51:06.214 --> 51:07.947
No! I know what I saw.

51:07.949 --> 51:10.649
- Come on.
- Adam, hold on!

51:12.953 --> 51:16.355
Hey Adam, you're not...

51:16.357 --> 51:20.559
wait here!

51:26.000 --> 51:28.300
- Hello?
- Who's upstairs?

51:28.302 --> 51:30.002
- Up a... who's up where?
- Upstairs.

51:30.004 --> 51:31.537
I just saw my mother upstairs.

51:31.539 --> 51:33.239
No, there... there... I don't understand.

51:33.241 --> 51:34.974
- In my house?
- Glenda, please.

51:34.976 --> 51:36.475
Can I take a look upstairs?

51:36.477 --> 51:38.611
There's nothing up there. I live alone!

51:38.613 --> 51:40.980
Glenda, please! Just let me take a look.

51:40.982 --> 51:42.381
- No, no, no, no.
- I need to know what I saw.

51:42.383 --> 51:44.016
No! No! No! Please!

51:44.018 --> 51:46.585
No! Please, don't go up there!

51:46.587 --> 51:48.587
I live alone!

51:49.522 --> 51:52.258
No! No! No!

51:54.261 --> 51:55.594
Stop him!

51:59.733 --> 52:01.467
Please don't.

52:03.937 --> 52:05.804
Stop him!

52:05.806 --> 52:09.508
Stop him!

52:09.510 --> 52:12.444
Stop, stop, stop.

52:12.446 --> 52:13.946
Stop him!

52:16.283 --> 52:19.685
No! No! No! No!

52:19.687 --> 52:21.420
No!

52:31.564 --> 52:33.365
There he is.

52:44.044 --> 52:45.744
My child.

52:50.083 --> 52:54.353
I couldn't save him after the fires.

53:02.662 --> 53:04.496
Please don't tell.

53:45.106 --> 53:47.039
What the hell?

54:29.816 --> 54:33.652
Hey. How's it going?

54:33.654 --> 54:36.021
All right. I'm just tired.

54:40.627 --> 54:42.628
Are you okay?

54:42.630 --> 54:45.664
Yeah, I'm fine.

54:45.666 --> 54:49.935
- You look tired, too.
- Oh, thanks.

54:49.937 --> 54:52.805
No, I'm sorry.

54:52.807 --> 54:55.774
I mean, you look great.

54:55.776 --> 54:57.709
You're beautiful.

55:01.815 --> 55:03.515
So what is it?

55:03.517 --> 55:06.218
Are you scared I'm gonna have
feelings for him again?

55:06.220 --> 55:09.588
Are you scared he hasn't forgiven you?

55:09.590 --> 55:12.591
Mmm, can it be both?

55:12.593 --> 55:15.093
I don't know.
I just want him to trust me again.

55:15.095 --> 55:17.095
- You know?
- Mmm.

55:17.097 --> 55:18.664
I don't know how this is gonna work.

55:18.666 --> 55:22.835
He definitely still seems upset with me.

55:22.837 --> 55:26.138
You're not worried about me?

55:26.140 --> 55:28.807
Nope.

55:28.809 --> 55:32.611
- You know I love you.
- Of course.

58:56.849 --> 59:00.218
Hey.

59:00.220 --> 59:02.421
Were you all right last night?

59:02.423 --> 59:04.890
What? What do you mean?

59:04.892 --> 59:07.325
You were crying in your sleep.

59:07.327 --> 59:09.261
I was?

59:09.263 --> 59:12.831
Or at least I thought you were.

59:12.833 --> 59:15.734
You were probably just dreaming.

59:18.371 --> 59:20.372
I don't remember.

59:24.777 --> 59:26.445
It's gonna be okay.

59:56.375 --> 59:59.010
- Hey.
- What was that about?

59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.412
Well, he's just checking on us.

01:00:00.414 --> 01:00:02.247
How close are you with
everyone in this group?

01:00:02.249 --> 01:00:04.249
Well, they just wanna help us, man.

01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:09.488
- Do they?
- Yeah.

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:10.989
Do you remember Angela?

01:00:10.991 --> 01:00:12.324
Angela who?

01:00:12.326 --> 01:00:14.059
Angela from high school?

01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:16.862
Uh, no.

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:18.130
Danny's sister?

01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:20.499
Oh! Yeah, what about her?

01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:22.134
Do you know if she's all right?

01:00:22.136 --> 01:00:23.235
What do you mean?

01:00:23.237 --> 01:00:25.337
Morning.

01:00:25.339 --> 01:00:29.074
- Hey.
- Hey. Good to see you.

01:00:29.076 --> 01:00:31.143
So what's the plan for today?

01:00:31.145 --> 01:00:35.814
Um, I don't know. I'm sorry, what about her?

01:00:35.816 --> 01:00:37.883
Wasn't important.

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:44.422
Okay.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.075
Lawrence!

01:01:12.385 --> 01:01:14.452
Lawrence!

01:01:26.899 --> 01:01:28.400
Hey, man. We'll be back.

01:01:28.402 --> 01:01:30.468
- You have to leave now?
- Yeah, I told you.

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:32.204
We're just gonna get some clothes
and stuff from the house.

01:01:32.206 --> 01:01:33.338
We'll be back in a few hours.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.842
- A few hours?
- Yeah.

01:01:36.844 --> 01:01:38.243
I left two messages with that detective.

01:01:38.245 --> 01:01:40.078
I still haven't heard anything back yet.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.047
Okay. I'll call him from the road.

01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:44.583
Why can't Christy just go?

01:01:44.585 --> 01:01:46.151
You all right, man?

01:01:46.153 --> 01:01:48.353
Just relax.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.954
What are you doing?

01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:24.256
Getting rid of this shit.

01:02:24.258 --> 01:02:26.892
I'll be back.

01:02:26.894 --> 01:02:28.193
Do you want me to come with you?

01:02:28.195 --> 01:02:30.495
No, stay with the baby.

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.064
I'm getting to the bottom of this right now.

01:02:33.066 --> 01:02:34.399
Adam!

01:02:36.936 --> 01:02:40.138
You know, we deserve better.

01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:45.110
Things are gonna work out for us...

01:02:45.112 --> 01:02:47.145
Soon.

01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:42.761
This faction is tremendous.

01:04:42.763 --> 01:04:46.765
You have all done so well.

01:04:46.767 --> 01:04:49.701
We've had our share of complications,

01:04:49.703 --> 01:04:53.638
but all has been rectifiable.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.342
The rewards tonight will be so fulfilling.

01:05:07.453 --> 01:05:11.056
She's beautiful.

01:05:11.058 --> 01:05:13.725
She is so perfect.

01:05:42.456 --> 01:05:45.757
Do you remember when we all
came here as kids?

01:05:45.759 --> 01:05:48.827
When we first put these up?

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:50.395
I thought I might find you here.

01:05:53.165 --> 01:05:55.100
I'm so glad you came.

01:06:01.273 --> 01:06:04.309
These woods have kind of become my home.

01:06:04.311 --> 01:06:06.177
Fluke of nature, they're the only place

01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:09.414
in the county that didn't get scorched.

01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:12.884
I think that's why they don't
like to come here.

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:18.890
Why did you say Lawrence is a monster?

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.860
Wherever they're from, whatever darkness,

01:06:21.862 --> 01:06:23.595
what does it matter what you call them?

01:06:23.597 --> 01:06:26.231
They're here, Adam.

01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:28.766
And you're with them, or you're here...

01:06:28.768 --> 01:06:30.635
With me.

01:06:34.607 --> 01:06:36.341
Come on!

01:06:53.893 --> 01:06:55.326
The first reference I could find

01:06:55.328 --> 01:06:58.696
was the Boston molasses flood in 1919,

01:06:58.698 --> 01:07:01.699
gateways was there helping people
who had lost their homes and loved ones

01:07:01.701 --> 01:07:04.435
get back on their feet, and,
boy, did they do a good job,

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.271
because every one in that town
went on with their life

01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:07.705
like nothing had ever happened.

01:07:07.707 --> 01:07:09.674
And then babies started getting stolen.

01:07:09.676 --> 01:07:11.776
Babies connected to the people who joined.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:15.313
And the dust bowl, coal fires,
earthquakes, tornadoes,

01:07:15.315 --> 01:07:17.615
it's not every disaster,
but where gateways goes,

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.617
everyone comes out just fixed and happy,

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.253
and one child lighter, and, and look...

01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:23.621
they showed up before.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:25.690
They showed up two weeks
before the fires hit.

01:07:25.692 --> 01:07:27.625
Everywhere they've ever been,
it's like, they knew...

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:28.927
they knew in advance.

01:07:28.929 --> 01:07:31.863
They know, or they cause the disasters.

01:07:31.865 --> 01:07:35.400
How can they cause the disasters?

01:07:35.402 --> 01:07:39.571
Um... always just a few weeks
before something happens.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.840
And always with him.

01:07:48.514 --> 01:07:50.582
1964.

01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:56.588
That's impossible.

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:59.691
I wish it were.

01:07:59.693 --> 01:08:01.559
Gateway started the fires.

01:08:04.797 --> 01:08:06.598
What is he?

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.400
He burns your life to the ground,

01:08:09.402 --> 01:08:12.237
and then trades you...

01:08:12.239 --> 01:08:14.239
a child for the perfect life.

01:08:15.641 --> 01:08:18.743
- Why children?
- I don't know.

01:08:18.745 --> 01:08:21.845
Maybe it's 'cause they're babies, they're
innocent, they don't know any better,

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.747
or they can be raised in some way,

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.515
or maybe they just consume their souls.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:29.754
I don't know. All I know
is no children ever come back.

01:08:29.756 --> 01:08:31.589
You need to get your child away from here

01:08:31.591 --> 01:08:32.890
as fast as you can,

01:08:32.892 --> 01:08:35.727
and you need to get to your wife because
they're probably already working on her.

01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:37.261
They go for the mother first.

01:08:37.264 --> 01:08:39.264
I mean, that's what they did to Christy.

01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:12.430
Angela!

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:17.635
Angela!

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.680
Where is she?

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.368
- Beth.
- Adam?

01:09:51.371 --> 01:09:53.071
- Beth, where are you?
- I'm home.

01:09:53.073 --> 01:09:55.373
You have to leave there right now!

01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:59.477
- Adam.
- Jake and Christy are not
trying to help us, okay?

01:09:59.479 --> 01:10:03.414
Adam, anyone can have anything.

01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:05.650
But no one can have everything.

01:10:05.652 --> 01:10:06.851
Beth!

01:10:06.853 --> 01:10:09.487
Beth!

01:10:52.965 --> 01:10:54.932
Come on!

01:10:56.402 --> 01:10:58.636
Come on!

01:10:58.638 --> 01:11:00.905
Hey, it's Beth.
Leave me a message at the beep.

01:12:12.845 --> 01:12:15.713
Hello. Welcome.

01:12:15.715 --> 01:12:17.515
Where is Emma?

01:12:17.517 --> 01:12:19.484
Adam, you have to let her go.

01:12:19.486 --> 01:12:21.052
Where is my daughter?

01:12:21.054 --> 01:12:23.120
She's going to a better place,

01:12:23.122 --> 01:12:27.792
so you and your wife
can find happiness in this one.

01:12:27.794 --> 01:12:29.760
- Don't touch me.
- Adam!

01:12:31.163 --> 01:12:33.764
What have you done with Beth and Emma?

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.500
I know you're upset. I know you're scared.

01:12:35.502 --> 01:12:37.268
It's not whatever you're thinking.

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.704
- Who are the watchers?
- Just calm down.

01:12:39.706 --> 01:12:41.839
I know what you did to your baby!

01:12:41.841 --> 01:12:43.841
The fires took everything.
We did what we had to do.

01:12:43.843 --> 01:12:46.277
- I don't care!
- Calm down, okay?

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.613
Where is my daughter?

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:50.781
We're taking her to a better place.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.917
For you, Adam!

01:12:52.919 --> 01:12:55.253
Stop it! Stop it!

01:12:57.089 --> 01:12:59.023
Adam.

01:12:59.025 --> 01:13:01.025
Oh, Adam.

01:13:01.027 --> 01:13:04.195
- Mom?
- Oh, Adam.

01:13:05.999 --> 01:13:08.533
I'm so sorry we had to do this to you.

01:13:09.768 --> 01:13:11.702
It was the only way to get you here.

01:13:11.704 --> 01:13:13.104
Do what to me?

01:13:13.106 --> 01:13:15.072
Mom, where have you been?

01:13:15.074 --> 01:13:16.307
Oh, I haven't been far.

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:18.709
I've been watching you.

01:13:18.711 --> 01:13:21.212
Oh, there's such a great future
for your family.

01:13:21.214 --> 01:13:23.147
Where are they? Are they okay?

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.283
Oh, yes, they're here. They're fine.

01:13:25.285 --> 01:13:28.686
Just come with us. Don't fight it.

01:13:28.688 --> 01:13:31.622
You deserve the life you never had.

01:13:43.302 --> 01:13:44.669
I was so worried about you.

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:46.837
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.673
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:50.174
I'm so sorry I haven't been there for you.

01:13:53.779 --> 01:13:58.816
- Where are we going?
- You'll see, be patient.

01:13:58.818 --> 01:14:01.652
Oh, I only wish I could have
done this with the two of you.

01:14:07.793 --> 01:14:09.126
They said you were missing.

01:14:11.631 --> 01:14:14.999
Adam, you can fight this
or you can embrace it.

01:14:15.001 --> 01:14:16.601
Adam, it will be much more clear

01:14:16.603 --> 01:14:18.035
once it happens.

01:14:27.112 --> 01:14:28.613
Beth?

01:14:33.151 --> 01:14:34.719
Adam.

01:14:37.923 --> 01:14:40.891
They're gonna fix us.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:42.927
You'll understand soon.

01:14:45.163 --> 01:14:47.632
Are you ready?

01:14:47.634 --> 01:14:49.367
I am.

01:14:49.369 --> 01:14:52.703
Ready for what?

01:14:52.705 --> 01:14:57.241
Adam, you had to lose everything
before you understood.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.744
To lose, even me, your mother.

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:03.681
- And now you know.
- Know what?

01:15:03.683 --> 01:15:06.317
Now you understand what it means to be empty.

01:15:06.319 --> 01:15:09.220
Now let yourself full.

01:15:09.222 --> 01:15:11.322
Emma will leave this horrible world,

01:15:11.324 --> 01:15:13.224
and she will be innocent forever.

01:15:13.226 --> 01:15:17.194
She'll be free of diseases
and sickness and even age,

01:15:17.196 --> 01:15:18.996
like Lawrence!

01:15:18.998 --> 01:15:20.131
What are you talking about?

01:15:20.133 --> 01:15:22.400
We can be a part of the future.

01:15:22.402 --> 01:15:24.135
This is insane!

01:15:24.137 --> 01:15:27.104
Beth! What have they told you?

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:28.406
Why is she here?

01:15:28.408 --> 01:15:30.708
Why is Emma here?

01:15:49.829 --> 01:15:52.830
Get off!

01:15:52.832 --> 01:15:54.732
Let go of me! Please!

01:15:54.734 --> 01:15:55.800
Stop it!

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.802
Beth! Don't give her to him!

01:15:57.804 --> 01:16:00.004
Please, no! Emma!

01:16:01.774 --> 01:16:03.841
Beth, please!

01:16:09.014 --> 01:16:10.448
No!

01:16:26.798 --> 01:16:29.133
No! Where is she?

01:16:29.135 --> 01:16:33.804
- Let her go.
- No! No! No! No! No!

01:16:41.313 --> 01:16:43.114
I love you.
