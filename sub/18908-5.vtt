00:06.707 --> 00:08.242
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:08.676 --> 00:10.178
[explosion]

00:10.211 --> 00:12.346
[gunfire]

00:12.380 --> 00:15.183
- So we were able to isolate
the sound they were hearing.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.318
- Our best guess--
some kind of message.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.588
- We need to send a response.
- What do you think it is?

00:20.621 --> 00:22.723
- I think it's a freaking
dead alien.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.358
- Whoa.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.493
- This must be
its communications protocol.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.195
- Quayle came to me.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.596
He was ready to give up
the whole damn cell

00:28.629 --> 00:31.199
to save his own ass,
so I killed him.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.733
[gunshots]

00:32.766 --> 00:34.602
- I'm afraid you lack both
the skill set

00:34.635 --> 00:36.637
and the constitution
to be an officer.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.106
I'm therefore transferring you

00:38.139 --> 00:39.640
to the general
surveillance pool.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.409
Clean out your office
and report down there

00:41.442 --> 00:42.610
in the morning.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.479
- Fire!
- My book! Mr. Bowman, help!

00:46.580 --> 00:48.516
- Smoke alarm didn't go off.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.551
I must've got to the fire
before the sensor tripped.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.753
There's a camera in
the smoke alarm in the kitchen.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.256
We can't talk about
anything in here anymore.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.794
[whooshing]

01:05.666 --> 01:08.702
[whooshing]

01:11.539 --> 01:14.542
[device beeping]

01:28.489 --> 01:31.192
[device powering down]

01:31.225 --> 01:33.561
- Holy shit, it worked.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.132
- We're already behind.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.434
Let's make sure it's off
and get it out of here.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.570
Stop staring at it
and get to work.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.573
[dramatic music]

01:45.606 --> 01:50.878
*

01:50.911 --> 01:53.847
- I can't move it.
- You said we'd be able to.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.417
- It's alien tech, man,
we're just guessing.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.189
[device humming]

02:02.656 --> 02:04.325
- It's waking up.
- What are you doing?

02:04.358 --> 02:05.826
- I'm trying to shut it down.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.697
- It's gonna nuke us,
guys.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.699
- It's not working.
- Time's up. We're done.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.434
- It's a drone--
we captured a live drone.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.868
- I said we're done.

02:14.902 --> 02:18.172
Pull out.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.708
Morgan, abort.

02:20.741 --> 02:21.775
Morgan!

02:21.809 --> 02:28.782
*

02:30.584 --> 02:31.852
- Camera's mounted.

02:31.885 --> 02:38.892
*

02:42.696 --> 02:45.733
[dramatic music]

02:45.766 --> 02:50.671
*

02:53.907 --> 02:56.910
[rustling]

03:00.381 --> 03:02.483
- They're out there again.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.651
- Keep your voice down.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.486
[rumbling]

03:05.519 --> 03:06.754
- I told you.

03:08.722 --> 03:12.460
[mechanical whirring]

03:12.493 --> 03:15.596
*

03:15.629 --> 03:17.331
[rumbling]

03:17.365 --> 03:18.866
Did you see that?

03:18.899 --> 03:21.769
- Yes. That's why I told you
to keep your voice down.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.771
[explosion]

03:23.804 --> 03:27.341
- [shouting]
- Hell was that?

03:27.375 --> 03:30.244
- [indistinct]
Watch your back!

03:30.278 --> 03:31.879
[alarm blaring]

03:31.912 --> 03:34.382
- Sweep out!

03:34.415 --> 03:35.816
[indistinct shouting]

03:35.849 --> 03:38.752
[radio chatter]

03:38.786 --> 03:41.255
- Jesus.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.657
- Forward! Forward!

03:43.691 --> 03:45.659
- Suicide bomber?

03:45.693 --> 03:47.661
[radio chatter]

03:47.695 --> 03:50.298
- They were making a bomb.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.666
Got the recipe wrong.

03:52.700 --> 03:56.637
- How the hell
are they making bombs?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.639
- I'll handle it.
Let's go.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.974
[alarm blaring]

04:01.008 --> 04:03.544
[indistinct shouting]

04:03.577 --> 04:06.980
*

04:10.518 --> 04:12.853
- Is there anything else?

04:12.886 --> 04:14.422
- Can't be sick
of oranges already, love.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.956
You just got home.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.827
- I wish we had cereal
or oatmeal.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.429
I hate oranges.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.331
[knocking]

04:23.364 --> 04:25.533
- Morning.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.702
- Hi, Lindsey.
- Look what I brought.

04:28.736 --> 04:32.306
Are we ready to get to work?

04:32.340 --> 04:34.975
- Uh-huh.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.578
- Good morning,
everyone--beautiful.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.879
- Morning, Dad.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.816
- Get enough to eat,
big man?

04:49.457 --> 04:51.559
Let's take Minnie for a walk.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.429
- Yeah.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.865
I can't live like this,

04:57.898 --> 04:59.600
with cameras
watching everything we do.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.868
- We have nothing to hide.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.436
We're just
model citizens, right?

05:02.470 --> 05:03.871
- [sighs]

05:03.904 --> 05:06.106
How long has
Jennifer been watching?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.776
If she has actual recordings--
- I don't know.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.444
That's why I got to go back
in the office

05:10.478 --> 05:12.913
and find out
what she knows.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.482
- If you go in there
voluntarily,

05:14.515 --> 05:17.351
they might just arrest you.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.387
- They're gonna be looking
for me either way.

05:19.420 --> 05:23.123
If I don't go back in willingly,
it seems suspicious.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.793
I know it's a risk,
but I need to talk to Jennifer,

05:25.826 --> 05:28.662
and I need to figure out
what Bram's real situation is.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.731
I can't do any of
that from here.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.400
- I wish I could help.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.802
- Then stay out of it.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.738
- Stay at home
and play housewife?

05:37.771 --> 05:39.873
- I don't care
what you call it.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.376
The only thing that matters
is righting this ship,

05:42.410 --> 05:45.779
and we'll both do whatever
it takes to do that, right?

05:45.813 --> 05:48.916
That means playing our roles--
me the good soldier,

05:48.949 --> 05:51.151
you the good citizen.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.655
- Because I wasn't
before, right?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.624
- Do we have to get
back into this?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.529
- I was trying
to protect you.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.097
- I can take care
of myself,

06:04.131 --> 06:07.067
but Charlie and Gracie
need you right now.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.939
I'll update you
as soon as I can.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.574
- Okay.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.950
[tense music]

06:22.983 --> 06:29.990
*

06:46.740 --> 06:49.009
[scanners chiming]

06:49.042 --> 06:50.578
- Go through.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.683
[inaudible]

06:55.716 --> 07:00.087
*

07:00.120 --> 07:03.156
Step through, sir.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.993
Step through, ma'am.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.861
Step forward.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.030
- I'm Will Bowman, I've been out
of the bloc on assignment.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.098
I'm here to report.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.234
*

07:14.267 --> 07:16.504
- I have him.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.638
Come with me.

07:17.671 --> 07:24.645
*

07:25.779 --> 07:26.880
[door opens]

07:28.215 --> 07:30.017
- I'm Dan Bennett,

07:30.050 --> 07:33.721
Chief of the Special
Police Division.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.623
Welcome back.

07:35.656 --> 07:40.127
- Thank you.
- Your reputation precedes you.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.129
- Look, I don't know
what happened when I left,

07:42.162 --> 07:44.632
but I went to Santa Monica
in an official capacity.

07:44.665 --> 07:48.001
I had transit documents
authorized by the Proxy's office

07:48.035 --> 07:50.504
as a reward for finding the VIP.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.906
- Why would the Proxy provide
you with transit documents

07:52.940 --> 07:55.008
simply for doing your job?

07:55.042 --> 07:58.011
- You'd have to ask him that.
- He's been exited.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.281
- So I heard.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.484
- Did you recover
your missing child?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.956
- Yes.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.223
I came back in as soon
as I got home.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.892
I'm ready to work.

08:11.925 --> 08:17.565
- Finding the missing VIP
was obviously commendable.

08:17.598 --> 08:21.769
But other facts
in your file

08:21.802 --> 08:25.539
raise certain questions.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.108
Detective Bolton Miller.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.845
"Beau."

08:31.879 --> 08:33.681
- Good enough guy--
what about him?

08:33.714 --> 08:35.082
- He walked off
the reservation

08:35.115 --> 08:37.651
right before
the VIP disappeared.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.854
- I didn't know that.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.923
Did you talk
to Jennifer McMahon about it?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.925
- Did Detective Miller
have sympathies

08:44.958 --> 08:46.660
toward the Insurgency?

08:48.629 --> 08:51.131
- Beau?

08:51.164 --> 08:52.866
If he did, he kept 'em
hidden from me.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.102
- You worked together
to turn Alexander Quayle,

08:55.135 --> 08:57.070
a key member
of Broussard's cell.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.271
- That's right.

08:58.305 --> 09:02.610
- Who was,
rather conveniently,

09:02.643 --> 09:05.012
assassinated in one
of our safe houses

09:05.045 --> 09:07.848
before he could start talking.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.216
- You think Beau was our leak?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.852
- I think there was a leak,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.822
but I'm not sure it was him.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.128
Let's talk about
your other son, Bram.

09:21.161 --> 09:25.599
He was caught trying to go
under the wall...

09:25.633 --> 09:27.000
- Yes.

09:27.034 --> 09:31.739
- In a tunnel that we discovered
based on your tip.

09:31.772 --> 09:36.009
Seems like an odd coincidence.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.278
- You think I'd try to get
my own son arrested?

09:38.311 --> 09:41.148
- I don't know what to think.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.751
Something odd was happening
in your division,

09:43.784 --> 09:45.285
and I need to know
what it was

09:45.318 --> 09:49.757
before I hand you
a badge and a gun.

09:49.790 --> 09:53.026
- The moment Phyllis died,
I knew we had a leak,

09:53.060 --> 09:56.196
but finding it wasn't my job.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.165
So I kept my head down
and did my work,

09:58.198 --> 10:02.135
which is how I recovered the VIP
and saved this bloc.

10:02.169 --> 10:06.940
Now, you need to find Broussard,
and I can help,

10:06.974 --> 10:09.409
which is why you need
to put me back on the street.

10:24.992 --> 10:25.158
.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.995
- Guys, we rehearse these ops
so that

10:29.196 --> 10:29.663
we don't run into amateur hour
shit like we did back there.

10:30.397 --> 10:30.864
When I give a command,
it's done

10:31.631 --> 10:32.365
in the best
interest of the unit.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.567
I won't have time to explain
myself on the battlefield.

10:34.601 --> 10:38.138
- I just don't ever recall
voting you in as chairman.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.440
- Chairman?

10:40.473 --> 10:43.677
This is a military
operation, Eckhart.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.680
- Guys, our drone's shift
is over, he's headed home.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.189
- What's the range
on your transmitter?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.091
- We're about to find out.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.163
- Damn.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.798
- Here we go.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.841
Oh, stay with us.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.977
- What, we lost signal?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.780
- No.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.349
No, there's no light source.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.185
We're seeing what it sees.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.921
- And what are we seeing?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.923
- Drones.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.129
- God, there are
hundreds of them.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.098
- Thousands.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.100
- With that many of them, they
could vaporize the entire bloc.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.969
How the hell are we
gonna fight that?

11:42.002 --> 11:42.970
- Quiet!

11:43.003 --> 11:44.471
[machinery humming]

11:44.504 --> 11:46.139
- What is that?

11:46.173 --> 11:49.176
[machinery humming]

11:55.348 --> 11:57.951
- Hmm.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.520
You didn't do your homework.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.890
- My brother just came home.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.392
- This work is important
to Gracie.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.294
- Why?

12:07.327 --> 12:10.497
- Because the Greatest Day
is going to save all of us.

12:10.530 --> 12:14.034
- But lots of other religions
say that.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.237
How do we know it's true?

12:17.270 --> 12:20.040
- Did those other religions
build giant walls?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.175
Do they have spaceships?

12:22.209 --> 12:24.878
Their miracles
are just fairytales.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.881
We can see proof of the
Greatest Day all around us.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.987
Where are you
getting these ideas?

12:43.964 --> 12:46.399
Let's continue with
the lesson, okay?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.400
Okay.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.954
- Don't move.

13:06.987 --> 13:07.988
Back in line.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.099
- So who wants to tell me

13:19.132 --> 13:21.334
where the bomber
got his material?

13:26.373 --> 13:27.841
Huh?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.145
One...

13:34.514 --> 13:37.184
two...

13:37.217 --> 13:40.954
- [screams]

13:40.988 --> 13:42.489
- Three.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.095
One...

13:48.128 --> 13:50.597
two--

13:50.630 --> 13:53.600
- That's enough!

13:53.633 --> 13:56.336
Everybody on the buses.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.337
Let's go!

13:57.370 --> 13:59.873
[bus engine turning over]

13:59.907 --> 14:02.342
This is a labor camp,
which means our workers

14:02.375 --> 14:05.245
should probably do
some actual labor.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.980
- And What about the bomb?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.016
- I'll handle it...

14:09.049 --> 14:10.550
with a more targeted strategy

14:10.583 --> 14:13.420
than whacking prisoners
in the head.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.462
- You--clean up duty.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.402
- I promise
I've been listening,

14:29.436 --> 14:32.539
but I haven't
heard anything yet.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.241
- If that shithead last night
had blown up

14:34.274 --> 14:37.110
one of our Host shipments
instead of just himself,

14:37.144 --> 14:39.512
you'd be dead--
not in the Factory,

14:39.546 --> 14:42.549
not in another labor camp,
just dead,

14:42.582 --> 14:46.586
along with every other prisoner
in this camp.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.256
Do you understand?

14:49.289 --> 14:51.291
- I'll see what I can find out.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.293
- You do that.

15:03.070 --> 15:03.236
.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.437
- Will Bowman.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.943
This is Detective Burke,
your new partner.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.311
- My pleasure.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.146
- How's it going?

15:13.180 --> 15:17.184
- Detective Burke is familiar
with my way of doing things.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.986
- Let me show you your desk.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.557
[elevator humming]

15:26.526 --> 15:30.097
- So what's your story?

15:30.130 --> 15:33.333
- Honor and duty.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.303
I'm dedicated to rooting out
and destroying the terrorism

15:36.336 --> 15:39.272
that threatens the security
of our Los Angeles bloc.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.315
- Where's Jennifer?

15:50.517 --> 15:51.518
- Who?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.386
- Jennifer McMahon.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.356
She was one of the detectives on
my counterinsurgency task force.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.758
- I'm not familiar with her.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.129
- Really? She worked here
for the better part of a year.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.166
- Your desk.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.609
- Hey, Betsy,
have you seen Jennifer?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.411
- Um, sorry.

16:18.445 --> 16:22.482
So much work to do today, it's--
- Hey, where is she?

16:22.515 --> 16:26.019
- Uh, I really don't know.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.024
- A number of staff
was recently relocated

16:31.058 --> 16:32.625
to the surveillance annex.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.461
Maybe your friend is there.

16:36.829 --> 16:44.071
*

17:05.658 --> 17:06.693
[chime]

17:09.229 --> 17:11.264
[handle rattles]

17:16.769 --> 17:21.741
[mechanical humming]

17:21.774 --> 17:22.742
[keyboard clacks]

17:22.775 --> 17:26.413
[humming continues]

17:26.446 --> 17:27.480
[sound stops]

17:29.116 --> 17:30.650
- We need more footage.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.755
- We need to know
more about that audio signal.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.424
If that's how they communicate,

17:37.457 --> 17:40.160
we'll have something
big--something actionable.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.495
- This is pointless.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.298
You saw it yourself--
there are thousands of drones

17:45.332 --> 17:46.733
in those walls.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.102
I mean, didn't you see
that whole bloody nest?

17:49.136 --> 17:52.239
What does it matter
if we crack their communication?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.641
- Put that audio file
on a thumb drive.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.644
I'll take it to Hennessey,
see if he has any ideas.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.779
- So once again you're going
for a stroll around town

17:59.812 --> 18:02.115
while we're all stuck
underground doing nothing?

18:02.149 --> 18:03.583
- I know how to handle myself.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.252
You don't.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.454
What if you pop your head up
out there and a camera

18:07.487 --> 18:11.191
or a Redhat or a civilian
looking for a reward sees you?

18:11.224 --> 18:12.625
We all die.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.269
Sit tight.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.893
- What's it like
being a mole?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.531
- What?

18:51.564 --> 18:54.667
- The camp commander saved
your ass again this morning.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.670
Once might be a coincidence,
but twice?

19:05.378 --> 19:08.781
- I'm not the only one
with secrets.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.850
You know something
about the bomb.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.859
Snyder trusts me.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.263
I can feed him information
and keep him off your trail.

19:23.296 --> 19:27.334
- If he realizes that you're
lying to him, you're dead.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.802
- It's no more dangerous
than going under the wall.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.215
- Tell Snyder that it was
a three-person gang.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.750
Pinto and Lyons
were helping Morales

19:43.783 --> 19:45.418
steal supplies for his bomb.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.421
They were gonna blow a hole
in the fence and escape.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.725
- Is it true?
- Does it matter?

19:52.759 --> 19:55.328
- They'll get sent
to the Factory.

19:55.362 --> 19:59.866
- There's no reason for Snyder
not to believe their story.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.369
We've got big plans.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.572
But we need space to operate.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.574
Pinto and Lyons
understand the stakes.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.442
They signed up for this.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.347
You said you wanted
to help us.

20:16.483 --> 20:20.487
Did you mean it?

20:20.520 --> 20:23.590
- Yeah, I meant it.

20:39.572 --> 20:39.706
.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.708
- This was a terrorist attack

20:42.642 --> 20:43.510
at a Homeland Security
recruitment center.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.813
They tell me you're
a great investigator.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.681
So why don't you
tell me what happened here?

20:50.783 --> 20:53.820
- Is this a test, Bob?

20:56.323 --> 20:58.525
All right.

20:58.558 --> 21:02.395
Well, it looks like
blast came from inside.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.567
It was a phased attack.

21:07.600 --> 21:12.405
Shooters were placed here
to ambush the survivors...

21:12.439 --> 21:15.007
and the first responders.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.345
My guess is, the explosion

21:18.378 --> 21:20.413
pushed everybody that way.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.349
The bomb was just a diversion.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.552
They locked the gate,
shot the survivors

21:25.585 --> 21:29.322
like fish in a barrel--
which is a pro tactic,

21:29.356 --> 21:31.358
and they left
their calling card.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.862
How'd I do?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.964
- Broussard's ego's grown
in lockstep

21:37.997 --> 21:41.434
with his destructiveness.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.336
- Doesn't seem like
Broussard's MO.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.373
He was a military
target guy.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.341
- It doesn't matter.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.710
Once the good people
of this bloc understand

21:50.743 --> 21:53.012
that Broussard is the reason
for the oppression

21:53.045 --> 21:56.616
and the misery
that they're suffering,

21:56.649 --> 21:59.386
they'll root him out
themselves.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.929
[whooshing]

22:18.004 --> 22:25.044
*

22:28.681 --> 22:31.384
- Hey, it's me.

22:31.418 --> 22:34.053
Yeah, I stuck my head up
for a meeting.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.088
Can I see you after?

22:36.122 --> 22:39.559
*

22:39.592 --> 22:41.494
I got to go.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.631
- Forgive me.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.634
Perhaps that
is an unfair question...

22:49.869 --> 22:52.672
But let me say
only two things.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.674
The French have
helped us greatly,

22:54.707 --> 22:57.544
and they are too powerful
to combat.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.647
- For years,
I've heard that dismal...

23:00.680 --> 23:04.451
- Haven't had a signal
from you in a while.

23:04.484 --> 23:08.588
- I've become more popular
than I want to be.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.724
- Nice to be popular.

23:11.758 --> 23:14.427
- Not in our line of work.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.128
- Our friends with
the red hands

23:16.162 --> 23:17.930
seem to think differently.

23:17.964 --> 23:22.669
Catchy PR campaign
they got going.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.472
- Any luck making
contact with 'em?

23:25.505 --> 23:27.139
- They're a closed loop.

23:27.173 --> 23:30.710
As far as I can tell, they want
to talk, they come to you.

23:32.579 --> 23:36.483
- Any idea who they might be?

23:36.516 --> 23:38.117
- Not of our world.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.488
They're something new.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.159
Any progress on that
tech you acquired?

23:49.228 --> 23:51.631
- Some.
- Mm?

23:51.664 --> 23:53.600
- I need you to find me
an audio engineer.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.001
- I couldn't let her die
for something

23:55.034 --> 23:56.736
that wasn't her fault.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.906
So I let her go last night.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.708
- You what?

24:01.741 --> 24:03.710
- I didn't think it would rain,

24:03.743 --> 24:04.844
and, after all, she's a woman.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.925
- Pinto and Lyons.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.196
Idiots.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.768
Take 'em to interrogation.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.938
[gunfire]

24:31.971 --> 24:33.940
*

24:33.973 --> 24:38.044
- This is what happens
when you break the rules.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.079
You answer to me.

24:40.112 --> 24:45.184
*

24:45.217 --> 24:47.153
- Right, one more row.
Come on.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.556
- Let's go! Back to work.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.223
- Let's go.

25:05.638 --> 25:05.805
.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.074
- Hello.
- Hey, Mom.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.943
- Hi.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.278
Where's your brother?

25:12.311 --> 25:13.980
- He went out.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.281
- Out where?

25:15.314 --> 25:18.150
- He said he wanted
to go for a walk.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.119
- And you let him?

25:20.152 --> 25:22.822
- He's not my student.

25:22.855 --> 25:29.829
*

25:29.862 --> 25:30.897
- Charlie!

25:30.930 --> 25:37.904
*

25:37.937 --> 25:39.639
Charlie?

25:43.142 --> 25:46.145
You can't just
run off like that.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.180
- I was getting things
we needed--look.

25:48.214 --> 25:54.587
*

25:54.621 --> 25:56.656
- This isn't Santa Monica.
- What are you doing?

25:56.689 --> 25:58.124
- You can't just go
around stealing

25:58.157 --> 26:01.127
other people's...

26:01.160 --> 26:03.129
There are rules here.

26:03.162 --> 26:07.934
- Don't we need that stuff?
- You're not listening to me.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.302
Okay?
You're gonna stay safe.

26:10.336 --> 26:14.874
So no stealing stuff,
knucklehead.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.276
No breaking the rules.
- Okay.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.613
- Listen, things are
different, right?

26:20.647 --> 26:24.016
So you can let me and Dad
take care of you again.

26:24.050 --> 26:27.286
*

26:27.319 --> 26:29.021
- That's a waste.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.758
- In this bloc, people are
always watching, my love.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.292
You understand that?

26:33.325 --> 26:34.894
- Yeah.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.670
- Mm, look at you.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.705
You were so skinny
in high school.

26:45.738 --> 26:46.906
- [chuckles]

26:46.939 --> 26:48.307
My mom's cooking.
- Mm.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.642
- Mm-hmm.

26:49.676 --> 26:53.946
- I used to be able
to pin you down.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.214
I can still take you.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.983
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.351
- You got me?
- Mm-hmm.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.056
Ah!

27:04.090 --> 27:06.325
[both chuckling]

27:09.361 --> 27:11.330
You can stay,
if you want.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.235
- It's too dangerous.

27:16.268 --> 27:19.071
- You can't spend the rest of
your life trapped underground.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.372
You'll go crazy.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.811
- You'd get tired of me.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.079
- No, I wouldn't,

27:27.113 --> 27:30.416
'cause you make me laugh.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.858
- I'm not the kid
you used to know.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.760
- Well, thank God,
'cause I wouldn't have slept

27:40.793 --> 27:42.228
with the kid I used to know.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.402
[pounding]

27:57.844 --> 27:58.911
[knocks]

28:00.479 --> 28:04.383
- Hey.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.185
What's going on?

28:06.218 --> 28:08.721
- Lindsey said I'm
a bad influence on Gracie.

28:08.755 --> 28:12.158
She told me
to stay in my room.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.393
- You don't have
to stay in here.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.028
I'll go talk to Lindsey.

28:18.497 --> 28:21.400
[indistinct chatter]

28:21.433 --> 28:24.136
- So what do you think
the answer to this would be?

28:24.170 --> 28:25.805
We're almost done
for the day.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.074
- Did you tell Charlie
to stay in his room?

28:28.107 --> 28:29.876
- He was being disruptive.

28:29.909 --> 28:33.012
Gracie's work requires
peace of environment.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.015
- This isn't your house,
Charlie's not your son,

28:36.048 --> 28:39.151
and it's certainly not your job
to discipline him.

28:39.185 --> 28:42.188
So that's not gonna
happen again.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.757
- I can't make that promise,
Mrs. Bowman.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.326
My responsibility is to Gracie
and her studies,

28:47.359 --> 28:51.463
and to teach her,
I need a sound environment.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.065
- Get out of my house.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.170
- Can't you see?

28:58.204 --> 29:01.340
That child is a poison.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.175
He burned my book.

29:03.209 --> 29:06.913
*

29:06.946 --> 29:09.949
- I don't give a shit
about your book.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.450
Get out!

29:11.483 --> 29:13.319
Get out of my house.

29:13.352 --> 29:16.055
- You're making a big mistake.
- I don't care.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.456
[door locks]

29:17.489 --> 29:24.496
*

29:30.502 --> 29:32.538
- Okay, move on.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.541
[scanners chiming]

29:40.346 --> 29:42.214
- ID.

29:43.850 --> 29:44.851
[chimes]

29:58.197 --> 29:59.966
- This is what we've collected
on Broussard

29:59.999 --> 30:01.400
since you've been gone.

30:01.433 --> 30:04.270
I expect you to be current
by tomorrow morning.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.843
[loud rumbling]

30:10.877 --> 30:12.011
- What was that?

30:12.044 --> 30:14.546
[screaming]
- Evacuate!

30:14.580 --> 30:17.149
- EMTs and Fire in here!

30:17.183 --> 30:18.584
- The other door is locked!

30:18.617 --> 30:21.587
[indistinct sobs and screams]

30:22.889 --> 30:24.256
- [groans]

30:24.290 --> 30:27.259
[alarm blaring]

30:29.561 --> 30:31.931
- [sobbing] Are you okay?

30:31.964 --> 30:33.933
[radio chatter]

30:36.435 --> 30:38.871
They're coming for me.

30:38.905 --> 30:41.007
[whimpering]

30:41.040 --> 30:43.309
*

30:43.342 --> 30:45.444
- Just keep it together!

30:45.477 --> 30:47.013
Get outside!

30:47.046 --> 30:49.548
- Help me! Please!

30:49.581 --> 30:52.584
[radio chatter]

30:56.688 --> 30:58.157
[indistinct screaming]

30:58.190 --> 31:00.059
- Don't panic!

31:00.092 --> 31:03.062
[indistinct shouting]

31:05.197 --> 31:08.567
- He's gone!
- I can't find him anywhere!

31:08.600 --> 31:10.970
[alarm blaring]

31:11.003 --> 31:17.977
*

31:28.687 --> 31:31.924
[indistinct shouting
over monitors]

31:31.958 --> 31:38.965
*

31:53.079 --> 31:54.981
- Drink.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.219
Don't blame yourself
for this morning.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.388
That mouth-breather Jenkins
was trying to make a point

32:02.421 --> 32:05.291
instead of doing his job.

32:05.324 --> 32:08.560
- Well,
aren't you his boss?

32:08.594 --> 32:11.097
- Technically.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.100
But have you ever tried
to train a bear?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.170
Goddamn Jenkins.

32:18.204 --> 32:21.507
I needed to interrogate
those bomb-making morons.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.510
I guarantee this
thing runs deeper.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.312
[door opens]

32:29.681 --> 32:32.284
- That shipment just arrived
at the loading facility.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.519
- I'm coming.

32:33.552 --> 32:39.391
*

32:39.425 --> 32:42.128
Just keep doing good work.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.163
As long as we don't make
any mistakes,

32:44.196 --> 32:46.999
you and I are gonna
get out of this shithole.

32:47.033 --> 32:49.168
I promise.

32:57.676 --> 33:04.716
*

33:06.418 --> 33:10.156
- Extra security
for the shipment--it's going up.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.191
- We'll take good care of it.

33:12.224 --> 33:19.198
*

33:24.736 --> 33:27.206
- We're unloading it here.

33:28.807 --> 33:36.048
*

33:39.485 --> 33:42.321
[knocks]

33:42.354 --> 33:49.328
*

33:51.163 --> 33:52.598
- Jennifer?

33:52.631 --> 33:59.638
*

34:20.326 --> 34:27.366
*

34:36.642 --> 34:40.379
Where's Jennifer?

34:40.412 --> 34:42.381
What happened to her?

34:42.414 --> 34:45.251
- Agent McMahon
wasn't adaptable.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.654
She didn't have the constitution
to survive in the new system.

34:48.687 --> 34:54.826
*

34:54.860 --> 34:57.696
See you tomorrow.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.132
[engine turns over]

35:11.743 --> 35:11.877
.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.846
[indistinct chatter]

35:36.402 --> 35:39.705
- Every time something
happens like this morning,

35:39.738 --> 35:43.809
it's a reminder
of what's important.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.212
Humans are stomping
down other humans

35:46.245 --> 35:49.881
because nobody thinks
we can beat the Raps,

35:49.915 --> 35:53.185
but we're gonna change
all that.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.821
- How?

35:55.854 --> 35:57.689
- With your help.

36:10.536 --> 36:14.606
- A shipment's coming
to the distribution center.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.876
- What kind of shipment?

36:17.909 --> 36:19.511
- I don't know.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.314
But Snyder acted like
it was a really big deal.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.317
[tense music]

36:28.720 --> 36:30.322
- Thanks.

36:30.356 --> 36:35.861
*

36:35.894 --> 36:38.764
- Talk to Jennifer?

36:38.797 --> 36:40.366
- I couldn't find her.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.637
I think something
terrible's happened to her.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.373
- What?

36:47.406 --> 36:50.376
- I don't know, but...

36:50.409 --> 36:53.812
I think whatever she knew
about us, she took with her.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.781
If this new crew
had anything on us,

36:55.814 --> 36:58.284
we'd already be
on our way to the Factory.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.754
- Are we gonna be okay?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.395
- They need to find Broussard

37:09.428 --> 37:12.030
and the thing
he took from the Rap.

37:12.063 --> 37:16.234
As long as I seem useful,
we'll be okay.

37:17.803 --> 37:21.640
I'll keep working to find out
what they have on us.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.409
How's Charlie?

37:26.712 --> 37:28.814
- Lindsey went after him,
and I threw her out.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.916
I've already called Maddie.
I'm gonna go up there tonight.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.552
I'm gonna
get ahead of this.

37:33.585 --> 37:37.423
And a messenger, uh,
dropped off clothes for you.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.278
[whooshing]

38:02.113 --> 38:05.317
[instrumental piano music]

38:05.351 --> 38:12.358
*

38:16.795 --> 38:18.830
- Katie, what are you
doing here?

38:18.864 --> 38:20.499
Is everything all right?

38:20.532 --> 38:22.568
- Well, can I just
speak with you

38:22.601 --> 38:25.471
for a couple seconds
in private?

38:25.504 --> 38:29.007
- You have to apologize.
- What?

38:29.040 --> 38:31.877
- She was trying to
help you, Katie.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.013
- Help me by brainwashing
my children?

38:35.046 --> 38:37.483
- Brainwashing?

38:37.516 --> 38:39.618
Nolan oversees
the Greatest Day movement.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.354
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
come into my house

38:42.388 --> 38:45.591
and insult his work--our work.

38:45.624 --> 38:49.495
- You're kidding.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.498
You actually believe this shit.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.670
- Don't be so judgmental.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.507
You don't know the things
that I've seen.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.680
- Wait, wait, wait.

39:10.816 --> 39:13.485
Everything you've been telling
me about Bram--is that true?

39:13.519 --> 39:14.653
- Of course it's true.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.388
- If you believe
the rest of this,

39:16.422 --> 39:18.056
how do I know that he's not
in the Factory or--

39:18.089 --> 39:21.660
- I would never, ever lie to
you about something like that.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.935
Look...

39:29.968 --> 39:31.703
I'll show you, okay?

39:37.909 --> 39:40.045
See? Bram Bowman.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.948
This column means
that he's at a labor camp.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.816
- What do
the other columns mean?

39:44.850 --> 39:46.685
- Look, I don't know, I just
asked about Bram because--

39:46.718 --> 39:48.119
[knocking]

39:48.153 --> 39:49.821
- I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. Burgess

39:49.855 --> 39:51.056
is about to give his toast.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.057
He wants you there.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.825
- Of course.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.736
I'll be right back.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.748
[clinking on glass]

40:16.782 --> 40:20.752
- Maddie and I are so glad
that you could all be here.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.093
[applause]

40:28.126 --> 40:35.100
*

40:43.975 --> 40:47.012
[speech continues indistinct]

40:55.253 --> 41:02.494
*
