00:11.041 --> 00:14.041
NO. GO AWAY, JO.

00:14.041 --> 00:17.917
YOU BETTER MAKE
A WISH BEFORE I SET
THIS COUCH ON FIRE.

00:17.917 --> 00:21.583
MY WISH WOULD BE
FOR NO FURTHER
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

00:21.583 --> 00:26.208
OF TODAY'S HOLLOW, SYMBOLIC
MEANING AS A MILESTONE IN
THE LIFE OF PACEY WITTER.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.000
OK. EXCEPT,
NOW THAT YOU'VE
TOLD ME YOUR WISH,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.667
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY
COME TRUE.

YOUR NAIVE ENTHUSIASM, OK?

00:38.875 --> 00:41.667
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE HARM
IN CELEBRATING A BIRTHDAY?
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES IT.

00:41.667 --> 00:46.250
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS
THAT EVERY BIRTHDAY I'VE HAD
SINCE I WAS 10 YEARS OLD

00:46.250 --> 00:48.792
HAS BEEN
A COMPLETE DISASTER.

00:48.792 --> 00:54.208
I'M TALKING GUT-WRENCHING,
SOUL-SEARCHING,
QUESTION-THE-UNIVERSE AGONY.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.500
WELL, AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT
BEING DRAMATIC ABOUT IT.

00:58.250 --> 01:03.875
FOR EXAMPLE,
MY 12th BIRTHDAY PARTY,
MY FIRST BOY-GIRL PARTY,

01:03.875 --> 01:07.625
I ATE SO MUCH PIZZA
AND ICE CREAM, I PUKED
ON JUSTINE SHERMAN,

01:07.625 --> 01:08.917
A GIRL WHO I HAD
A MASSIVE CRUSH ON.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.625
REMEMBER THIS?
MM-HMM.

01:10.625 --> 01:13.375
SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO
CALL ME PACEY PUKEY FOR
THE REST OF THE YEAR,

01:13.375 --> 01:15.542
A QUAINT LITTLE NICKNAME
THAT MY FAMILY
PICKED UP ON

01:15.542 --> 01:19.375
AND NOW RESURFACES
ITSELF EVERY YEAR
AROUND THIS TIME

01:19.375 --> 01:21.375
TO HEARTY LAUGHS
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.750
OF COURSE, IT'S PROBABLY
NOT AS BAD AS 16,

01:24.750 --> 01:26.750
THE YEAR THAT
I THREW MYSELF A PARTY

01:26.750 --> 01:29.208
AND NOBODY
DECIDED TO SHOW UP.
THAT WAS GOOD.

01:29.208 --> 01:32.000
OH, YEAH. I ALSO
FAILED MY DRIVER'S TEST
THE SAME DAY.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.500
BUT NEITHER OF THOSE
WILL EVER, EVER BEAT 14,

01:36.500 --> 01:39.583
THE DAY I WAS
MAULED BY A DOG.

01:39.583 --> 01:42.583
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
THIS YEAR I THINK
I'LL JUST SKIP IT.

01:42.583 --> 01:46.583
HMM. NO.

01:46.583 --> 01:51.667
WELL, THERE
MAY BE ONE WAY

01:51.667 --> 01:53.792
THAT WE COULD
AVERT DISASTER--

01:53.792 --> 01:59.750
IF YOU AND I WERE
TO SPEND A QUIET
EVENING ALONE, HERE.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.375

JUST YOU AND ME.

02:55.291 --> 02:58.291

WITH GRETCHEN
TONIGHT, HUH?

03:00.208 --> 03:02.166
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S ANTICIPATION
OR NERVOUS TERROR.

03:02.166 --> 03:03.667
WHAT'S TO BE
TERRIFIED ABOUT?

03:03.667 --> 03:06.000
YOU GUYS KISSED,
AND SHE AGREED
TO GO OUT--

03:06.000 --> 03:08.708
OH, NO, NO.
I GET IT.
I GET IT.

03:08.708 --> 03:09.959

JUST--PACEY AND JOEY.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.083
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.500
I'M TERRIFIED
BECAUSE IT'S OUR
FIRST OFFICIAL DATE.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.708
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE
THE KISS, AND THERE'S
A MASSIVE BUILD-UP.

03:19.708 --> 03:24.083
PACEY AND JOEY,
IF THEY ASK ME,
I'LL TELL THEM.

03:24.083 --> 03:27.250
GRETCHEN WILL, TOO.
IT'S REALLY NOT
A BIG DEAL.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.375

LIKE A GREAT PLAN.

NIGHT ALONE, ME AND HIM.

03:39.959 --> 03:44.917
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE STILL
THINKS THERE'S SOME KIND OF
A BIRTHDAY CURSE ON HIM.

03:44.917 --> 03:48.959
I KNOW. PRETTY RIDICULOUS,
RIGHT? BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, THOUGH?

03:48.959 --> 03:52.000
WHAT?

03:52.000 --> 03:55.417
OH, NOTHING. I'M COOL.
I'M JUST GONNA PUT
SOME SHOES ON.

YOUR MOM'S BAD IDEA.

AND SHE WAS SO EXCITED
AND SO SWEET,

04:14.417 --> 04:16.834

I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

04:16.834 --> 04:19.125

YEAH, BUT I SAID YES.

MUCH OF A LIFE.

IT'LL BE FUN.

KILL ME, ISN'T HE?

SO HAPPY ABOUT?

05:00.792 --> 05:06.291
WELL, I'M HAPPY BECAUSE
YOU AGREED TO DO THESE FUN
SATURDAY AFTERNOON CRAFTS.

05:06.291 --> 05:09.166
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

05:09.166 --> 05:13.500
MY GRANDMOTHER
TAUGHT ME HOW TO DO
THE ART OF DECOUPAGE.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.041
WELL, I DON'T THINK
I'M SO GOOD AT IT.

05:15.041 --> 05:18.458
OH, THAT LOOKS FINE.

05:18.458 --> 05:22.834
SO, WHAT ARE YOUR BIG
PLANS FOR THIS EVENING?

05:22.834 --> 05:27.542
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
I'VE GOT, LIKE, 5 MORE
HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE,

05:27.542 --> 05:29.083
WHICH MEANS THAT
MY SATURDAY NIGHT
WILL BE SPENT

ILLICIT TEENAGE PARTIES.

WELL, THAT
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

05:39.875 --> 05:44.583
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, ALL THESE LAME
HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE,

05:44.583 --> 05:47.208
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'VE SERVED THE COMMUNITY
ONCE OR LEARNED A THING.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.083

FAT WASTE OF TIME.

NATURAL TO DAYDREAM
ABOUT SEX.

STOP. NOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

06:38.750 --> 06:42.625
YOU'RE TRYING TO
FREAK ME OUT BECAUSE
YOU HATE DECOUPAGE

YOU HOPE TO BE GROUNDED

SO YOU CAN GET OUT OF
COMMUNITY SERVICE TONIGHT.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.708

"FREAK ME OUT"?

06:48.708 --> 06:50.041
WELL, IT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK,

TO SAFE SEXUALITY,

06:51.333 --> 06:54.041

TO DECOUPAGE,

THE BETTER YOU GET,

06:57.625 --> 07:01.708

LIKE TO BE TAKEN ON

I JUST, UM--THERE'S
BEEN A SLIGHT
CHANGE OF PLANS.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.125

MY PARENTS DECIDED

07:40.125 --> 07:42.083
TO THROW PACEY
A SURPRISE
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.625
JOEY WAS GONNA
TELL YOU ABOUT IT,

07:43.625 --> 07:46.041
BUT I TOLD HER
I WOULD, BECAUSE--

07:46.041 --> 07:49.125
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING. OK.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.875
UH, NOT MUCH OF
A FIRST DATE, BUT--

07:51.875 --> 07:53.375
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING,
ACTUALLY,

07:53.375 --> 07:56.500
MAYBE WE COULD
POSTPONE THE WHOLE
FIRST DATE THING.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.667
WHY WOULD WE
WANT TO DO THAT?

07:59.667 --> 08:02.750
WELL, LOOK. YOU KNOW,
JOEY AND PACEY DON'T
KNOW ABOUT US YET,

08:02.750 --> 08:04.959
YOU KNOW?
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT
HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY

08:04.959 --> 08:06.667
IS THE BEST PLACE
TO COME OUT OF THAT
PARTICULAR CLOSET.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.125
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE IT'S A SECRET.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.125

BUT NOBODY KNOWS.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.125
JACK KNOWS.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.083
NOBODY ELSE KNOWS.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.458
WHAT, SO THAT MEANS
WE SHOULD HIDE IT?

08:13.458 --> 08:16.583
WELL, NO. I MEAN,
NOT SO MUCH HIDE IT,

08:16.583 --> 08:19.458
JUST NOT TELL
ANYONE YET.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.834
OK, BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE,

08:22.834 --> 08:25.834
SNEAKING AROUND IS
THE BEST WAY TO GET
CAUGHT DOING ANYTHING.

08:25.834 --> 08:27.625
WE WOULDN'T BE
SNEAKING AROUND.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.500
WE'RE JUST
POSTPONING THINGS.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.333
ALL RIGHT. IS THIS
ABOUT PACEY AND JOEY,

08:30.333 --> 08:31.417
OR IS THIS
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY

08:31.417 --> 08:33.332
AND YOU BEING ASHAMED
TO BE ON A DATE WITH ME?

08:33.332 --> 08:35.707
I'M NOT ASHAMED.
DAWSON, COME ON.

08:35.707 --> 08:37.082
YOU KNOW MY FAMILY.
I MEAN, THEY'RE INSANE.

08:37.082 --> 08:40.125
PLUS, YEAH, THIS
HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH JOEY AND PACEY.

08:40.125 --> 08:41.958
I MEAN, I THINK WE NEED
TO BE SENSITIVE TO THEM.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.082
SENSITIVE TO THEM
BY LYING TO THEM?

08:44.082 --> 08:47.000

KNOWN YOU TO BE

08:47.000 --> 08:49.333
ANYTHING OTHER
THAN STRAIGHTFORWARD.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:49.333 --> 08:52.625
LOOK. I'M JUST NOT READY
TO GO PUBLIC WITH THIS.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.834
I MEAN, YOU CAN STILL
COME TO THE PARTY
AND EVERYTHING. I JUST--

08:54.834 --> 08:56.959
YEAH, BUT IF THIS IS
SOMETHING YOU FEEL
YOU NEED TO HIDE,

08:56.959 --> 08:57.667
THEN IT'S SOMETHING
WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:07.417 --> 21:09.291
AND SHE WOULD TELL US
THIS STORY.

21:09.291 --> 21:13.583
IT WAS ABOUT A PRINCESS
NAMED ISABELLA.

21:13.583 --> 21:16.875
YOU SEE, ISABELLA
WAS A STAR DANCER.

21:16.875 --> 21:20.792
AND SHE WAS MEANT FOR A LIFE
DANCING AMONGST THE STARS.

21:20.792 --> 21:24.834
AND SHE WAS BLESSED
BECAUSE SHE COULD FLY
FROM STAR TO STAR.

21:24.834 --> 21:29.417
BUT SHE WAS CURSED, TOO.
BECAUSE FOR EVERY STAR
SHE'D VISIT,

21:29.417 --> 21:32.750
THERE'D BE ANOTHER ONE
SHE LEFT BEHIND.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.375
AND THAT WAS HER PLIGHT.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.750
FORCED TO LIVE ETERNITY
DANCING AMONGST THE STARS,

21:38.750 --> 21:42.458
FREE AS A BIRD...BUT ALONE.

21:44.417 --> 21:45.708
IT'S TRAGIC, HUH?

21:45.708 --> 21:48.125
NOT REALLY.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.208
THINK OF ALL THE STARS
SHE GOT TO VISIT

21:49.208 --> 21:50.291
AND HOW MUCH BETTER
SHE MADE THE LIVES

21:50.291 --> 21:52.625
OF THE PEOPLE
SHE MET THERE.

21:52.625 --> 21:56.000
BUT DAWSON, SHE LEAVES.

21:59.041 --> 22:02.250
Little boy: IF ISABELLA
VISITS, I DON'T WANT
HER TO LEAVE.

22:02.250 --> 22:02.875
OH, YOU DON'T, HUH?

22:02.875 --> 22:04.959
ME, EITHER.

22:04.959 --> 22:06.959
ME, EITHER.

22:08.291 --> 22:10.417
Mary: KIDS, COME
WASH UP FOR DINNER!

22:10.417 --> 22:12.458
Little Boy 2: DO WE HAVE TO?

22:12.458 --> 22:24.000
Little Girl: WE WERE
JUST GETTING TO THE GOOD PART
OF THE STORY.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.500
AW, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, REF?

22:25.500 --> 22:29.542
Mary: DOUG, DIDN'T I ASK YOU TO
SET UP THE CARD TABLE, HONEY?

22:29.542 --> 22:30.875
DON'T BELIEVE THEM, PACE.

22:33.083 --> 22:37.208
YOU ARE GONNA
GO TO COLLEGE AND DO
AMAZING, YOU KNOW THAT?

22:37.208 --> 22:40.166
THERE'S NOTHING THAT
THEY CAN SAY ABOUT IT.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.583
GONNA SHOCK THEM ALL.

22:44.041 --> 22:45.333
I KNOW YOU ARE.

22:47.458 --> 22:50.333
WELL,
WHAT IF I DON'T?

22:50.333 --> 22:53.667
WHAT IF THEY ARE
100% CORRECT,

22:53.667 --> 22:56.375
AND I AM SIMPLY
TOO STUPID

22:56.375 --> 22:58.583
TO DO ANYTHING
WORTHWHILE
WITH MY LIFE?

23:00.375 --> 23:02.667
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:05.792 --> 23:09.375
PACE, WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS CAN'T JUST BE
ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

23:09.375 --> 23:12.458
NO, IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY.

23:16.542 --> 23:19.166
LET'S TAKE THIS TO
THE BASEMENT, HUH?

23:29.875 --> 23:31.208
WRONG ROOM.

23:35.583 --> 23:38.500
Mary: DINNER'S ON. COME ON.

23:46.291 --> 23:49.875
Little Boy: COME ON, LET'S EAT.
Little Girl: YEAH, I'M STARVED.

23:49.875 --> 23:50.708
OK, EVERYBODY...

23:50.708 --> 23:53.792
IN HONOR OF PACEY'S
BIRTHDAY,

23:53.792 --> 23:56.667
I HAVE MADE
HIS FAVORITE:
CHIPPED BEEF ON TOAST.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.625
NOPE!
THAT'S DOUGY'S
FAVORITE.

23:58.625 --> 24:00.291
MINE'S SPAGHETTI
AND MEATBALLS.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.583
NAH-AH-HA. WHEN YOU
WERE A LITTLE KID

24:01.583 --> 24:04.333
YOU ALWAYS
BEGGED ME TO MAKE YOU
CHIPPED BEEF ON TOAST.

24:04.333 --> 24:07.500
THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.875
I ALWAYS PRETENDED
TO HATE CHIPPED BEEF
ON TOAST,

24:10.875 --> 24:13.750
IN A VAIN ATTEMPT
TO MASK MY TRUE
FEELINGS OF LOVE.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.000
I LOVE  CHIPPED
BEEF ON TOAST.

24:17.667 --> 24:18.625
WE'VE ESTABLISHED
THAT, DOUG. THANKS
FOR THE INPUT.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.583
OH, NUTS.
YOU KNOW WHAT
I FORGOT?

24:21.583 --> 24:22.667
SPAGHETTI
AND MEATBALLS.

24:22.667 --> 24:23.625
KETCHUP.

24:23.625 --> 24:25.291
JOANNA, WILL YOU
GO GRAB THE KETCHUP?

24:25.291 --> 24:26.708
IT'S IN THE, UH, FRIDGE.

24:26.708 --> 24:27.667
SURE.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.208
Mary: DIG IN, EVERYBODY.
HERE, HONEY.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.000
Doug: MMM!

24:34.000 --> 24:36.417
Mary: MM-MM-MM-MM-MM!

24:36.417 --> 24:39.708
JOEY, HEY, UH...

24:41.583 --> 24:44.750
LOOK, I'M...I'M REALLY
SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO FIND
OUT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.041
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE UPSET.

24:46.041 --> 24:46.583
SO, WHAT...
ARE YOU GUYS LIKE,
DATING NOW?

24:46.583 --> 24:49.458
WELL, UH, WE...

24:49.458 --> 24:51.500
THIS WAS GOING TO BE
OUR FIRST DATE,
BUT PLANS CHANGED.

24:51.500 --> 24:52.500
BUT YOU ARE A COUPLE?

24:52.500 --> 24:53.708
UH, WE HAVEN'T REALLY

24:53.708 --> 24:54.750
DEFINED OUR
RELATIONSHIP YET.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.792
BUT IT IS
A RELATIONSHIP?

24:57.291 --> 24:59.166
I DON'T KNOW.
LISTEN, UM...

24:59.166 --> 25:00.041
OH! FOUND IT.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.041
EXCUSE ME.

25:08.333 --> 25:09.667
WHAT THE HELL
DO WE DO NOW?

25:09.667 --> 25:12.625
UM...I DON'T KNOW.

25:12.625 --> 25:13.834
BUT I THINK WE CAN
PROBABLY MOVE BEYOND

25:13.834 --> 25:14.875
THE "SHOULD WE/SHOULDN'T WE
TELL THEM" QUESTION.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.917
BY THE WAY, SHE THINKS
WE'RE A COUPLE NOW.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.542
WELL, DID YOU TELL HER
WE WERE A COUPLE?

25:18.542 --> 25:21.834
UM...NO, I TOLD HER
WE HAD A DATE.

25:21.834 --> 25:22.917
SO, YOU TOLD HER
WE WERE DATING.

25:22.917 --> 25:24.500
I TOLD HER WE HADN'T

25:24.500 --> 25:26.000
DEFINED
THE RELATIONSHIP YET.

25:26.000 --> 25:26.959
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY?

25:26.959 --> 25:29.583
SHE SAID, "BUT IT IS
A RELATIONSHIP."

25:32.166 --> 25:33.959
IS IT A RELATIONSHIP?

25:33.959 --> 25:35.959
I KNOW WHAT I THINK.
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

25:37.542 --> 25:39.208
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I THINK.

25:39.208 --> 25:43.083
WELL, I THINK THAT THIS
WAS NEVER ABOUT

25:43.083 --> 25:45.667
PACEY OR JOEY OR YOUR
FAMILY OR COMING OUT
OF ANY CLOSETS.

25:45.667 --> 25:46.792
I THINK THIS
IS ABOUT YOU,

25:46.792 --> 25:48.542
AND I THINK YOU NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT.

25:59.875 --> 26:00.375
OK, LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.542
NO, LET'S NOT.

26:01.542 --> 26:02.667
TODAY IS NOT
THE DAY, GRETCHEN.

26:02.667 --> 26:06.542
I MEAN, ANY OTHER DAY
THAT I WAS TO FIND YOU

26:06.542 --> 26:08.500
MAKING OUT ON
THE BASEMENT FLOOR
WITH DAWSON,

26:08.500 --> 26:10.208
OF ALL PEOPLE,
I WOULD PROBABLY
FREAK OUT.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.000
AND THEN WE WOULD
HAVE WORDS.
BUT NOT TODAY.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.708
TODAY, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

26:13.708 --> 26:15.125
I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

26:15.125 --> 26:17.375
IN FACT, I'D LIKE
TO PRETEND IT NEVER
EVEN HAPPENED,

26:17.375 --> 26:19.500
'CAUSE FRANKLY,
I GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
ON MY MIND.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.625
WHICH ARE?

26:22.834 --> 26:25.542
A CONVERSATION
THAT I AM SUPPOSED
TO HAVE WITH JOEY

26:25.542 --> 26:27.917
THAT WILL IMPACT
THE ENTIRE REST
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

26:27.917 --> 26:29.417
NOT TO MENTION,
EXPLAIN WHY I'VE BEEN

26:29.417 --> 26:30.834
IN SUCH A STATE
OF UTTER DESPAIR TODAY.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.250
PACEY, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:32.250 --> 26:34.542
YOU KNOW WHAT MY
ADVICE TO YOU WOULD BE?

26:34.542 --> 26:35.875
TO JUST STICK
TO YOUR OWN DRAMAS,

26:35.875 --> 26:36.708
BECAUSE THEY ARE
MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING.

26:39.000 --> 26:39.959
PACEY...

26:41.125 --> 26:42.333
[SIGH]

26:49.125 --> 26:50.542
[HYSTERICAL
LAUGHTER]

26:52.000 --> 26:56.417
AND THEN...THEN
I REALIZED THAT
SHE DOESN'T LOVE ME.

26:56.417 --> 26:58.500
SHE LOVES HIM, HUH?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.083
THAT'S WHY SHE WAS
HAVING SEX  WITH HIM
IN...IN THE BATHROOM!

27:01.083 --> 27:06.708
THERE'S GONNA BE
BEER BONGS, KEG STANDS,
BODY SHOTS.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.417
YOU GOT TO COME.

27:08.417 --> 27:10.375
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET YOUR FRIEND HOME.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.291
NO, SHE'S FINE.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.333
I THINK I'M
GONNA HURL.

27:13.333 --> 27:14.792
OH, NO!

27:14.792 --> 27:17.458
Little Girl: OPEN THE NEXT ONE!
HURRY!

27:17.458 --> 27:20.000
Little Boy: OOH, LOOK AT
THE PAPER ON THAT ONE.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Everyone: WHOO...

27:22.000 --> 27:22.375
IT'S AN ASHTRAY.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.875
YEAH.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.125
THANK YOU, I'VE
BEEN MEANING TO
TAKE UP SMOKING.

27:28.125 --> 27:28.792
UH, THAT ONE'S
FROM ME.

27:30.834 --> 27:33.250
Little Girl: WOW, LOOK AT THE
WRAPPING PAPER!

27:33.250 --> 27:35.208
FIREWORKS.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.959
Everyone: OOH! AHH!

27:40.625 --> 27:42.250
IT'S JUST WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.
THANKS, POP.

27:42.250 --> 27:45.125
Mary: YOU KNOW, I, UH,
RECENTLY READ AN ARTICLE

27:45.125 --> 27:46.166
IN, UH, LADIES HOME JOURNAL,

27:46.166 --> 27:50.041
THAT SAID A FUN WAY
TO BOND WITH YOUR KIDS,

27:50.041 --> 27:51.291
UH, ON THEIR BIRTHDAY,

27:51.291 --> 27:54.166
WAS TO RECALL A FAVORITE
MEMORY FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD.

27:54.166 --> 27:56.542
OH, JOY.

27:56.542 --> 27:57.792
I GUESS I'LL GO FIRST.

27:57.792 --> 28:01.000
AND, UH, MY MEMORY
WOULD HAVE TO BE

28:01.000 --> 28:03.083
WHEN PACEY WAS A BABY.

28:03.083 --> 28:06.917
IT WAS SUCH A RELIEF TO FINALLY
HAVE A LATE BLOOMER.

28:06.917 --> 28:09.500
NEVER BOTHERED ANYBODY.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.667
USED TO FALL ASLEEP
IN CARDBOARD BOXES.

28:11.667 --> 28:11.959
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:15.417 --> 28:19.667
AND THEN THERE WAS
THE TIME WE ALMOST
LEFT PACE AT 31 FLAVORS.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.250
I REMEMBER THAT, YEAH.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.834
WE WERE PRACTICALLY
DRIVING AWAY WHEN THIS
LADY FLAGGED US DOWN

28:22.834 --> 28:25.500
WITH PACEY JUST
WAILING IN HER ARMS.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.000
I SWEAR, WE WOULD
HAVE DRIVEN HOME

28:27.000 --> 28:28.667
BEFORE WE REALIZED
HE WAS EVEN GONE.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.000
I'LL TELL YOU, HE WAS
SO UPSET THAT HE
PEED HIS PANTS.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.417
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR UNCLE,
HE PEED HIS PANTS!

28:32.417 --> 28:34.375
[EVERYONE LAUGHS]

28:34.375 --> 28:35.000
THANKS FOR
THAT ONE, DOUG.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.375
YOU LIKE
THAT, HUH?

28:37.375 --> 28:38.917
UNCLE PEED
HIS PANTS.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.375
YOU KNOW MY FAVORITE
PACEY MEMORY?

28:41.375 --> 28:42.875
WHEN I WAS
IN FIFTH GRADE,

28:42.875 --> 28:45.834
THERE WAS THIS BULLY
NAMED MAX BRODY.

28:45.834 --> 28:47.041
AND HE WAS THE MEANEST
KID YOU'D EVER
WANT TO MEET.

28:47.041 --> 28:51.208
AND ONE DAY,
HE PUSHED ME
OFF THE SWING SET.

28:51.208 --> 28:52.375
HARD.

28:52.375 --> 28:55.083
I, UM, I SPLIT
MY LIP OPEN.

28:55.083 --> 28:57.875
AND PACEY, WHO WAS
IN SECOND GRADE
AT THE TIME,

28:57.875 --> 28:59.667
WAS SITTING OVER
IN THE SAND BOX.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.750
AND WHEN HE SAW
MAX PUSH ME,

29:01.750 --> 29:05.125
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYBODY RUN SO FAST.

29:05.125 --> 29:07.792
AND HE JUST STARTED
PUNCHING AND KICKING
HIM, SCREAMING,

29:07.792 --> 29:09.375
"STAY AWAY
FROM MY SISTER!"

29:09.375 --> 29:13.041
BUT THAT'S PACEY.
THE BRAVEST
GUY I KNOW.

29:13.041 --> 29:14.375
John:
BRAVE AND FOOLISH.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.250
AS I RECALL, PACEY
CAME HOME CRYING

29:16.250 --> 29:17.458
BECAUSE THAT BULLY
BEAT THE PULP
OUT OF HIM.

29:17.458 --> 29:19.458
I REMEMBER THAT.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.542
Kerry:
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME
THAT PACEY

29:20.542 --> 29:23.083
GOT UP AT 5:30
IN THE MORNING
AND DECIDED

29:23.083 --> 29:24.208
TO MAKE PANCAKES
FOR THE WHOLE
ENTIRE FAMILY?

29:24.208 --> 29:25.625
COME ON!

29:25.625 --> 29:28.750
BUT HE SET
THE KITCHEN ON FIRE

29:28.750 --> 29:30.834
AND SCRAPS DIED
OF SMOKE INHALATION.

29:36.834 --> 29:39.750
ALL RIGHT. I HAVE
A PACEY STORY--

29:39.750 --> 29:40.208
OH, ENOUGH!

29:40.208 --> 29:42.500
ENOUGH.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.792
LOOK AS MUCH
AS I LOVE BEING
PUBLICLY EVISCERATED

29:46.792 --> 29:49.083
ON MY OWN BIRTHDAY,
I THINK WE
CAN ALL GUESS

29:49.083 --> 29:51.375
WHAT THE THEME
OF THIS HAPPY ANECDOTE
IS GOING TO BE:

29:51.375 --> 29:54.458
PACEY MESSES UP
YET AGAIN. AM I RIGHT?

29:54.458 --> 29:56.291
PACEY KILLS THE DOG.

29:56.291 --> 29:58.125
OR PEES HIS PANTS,
OR PUKES,

29:58.125 --> 30:00.417
OR GETS THE PULP
BEATEN OUT OF HIM.

30:00.417 --> 30:02.166
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
THE THEME MIGHT BE?

30:02.166 --> 30:03.417
THE THEME OF EVERY
BIRTHDAY I'VE EVER HAD.

30:03.417 --> 30:07.375
WELL, THE THEME
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE,
FOR THAT MATTER.

30:07.375 --> 30:10.375
NO ONE GIVES
PACEY A BREAK.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.834
EVERYBODY EXPECTS
THE ABSOLUTE WORST
OUT OF PACEY.

30:11.834 --> 30:14.208
PACEY GETS THE SHORT
END OF THE STICK.

30:14.208 --> 30:16.291
PACEY GETS FIREWORKS
AND AN ASHTRAY,

30:16.291 --> 30:18.458
AND CHIPPED BEEF
ON TOAST FOR
HIS BIRTHDAY,

30:18.458 --> 30:21.125
AND ENDLESSLY HARASSED
BECAUSE HOW DARE HE
WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE

30:21.125 --> 30:22.875
SO HE CAN POSSIBLY
GET OUT OF THIS PLACE?

30:22.875 --> 30:24.917
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

30:24.917 --> 30:26.208
YOU AND YOUR WALLET
CAN BREATHE EASY,

30:26.208 --> 30:27.625
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
I COULD GO TO COLLEGE

30:27.625 --> 30:29.500
EVEN IF I WANTED TO,
BECAUSE I FOUND OUT
TODAY

30:29.500 --> 30:32.041
THAT THE ONLY SCHOOL
I THOUGHT WOULD TAKE ME,

30:32.041 --> 30:34.417
MY FALLBACK SCHOOL,
REJECTED ME.

30:34.417 --> 30:36.542
SO I'M NOT GOING
TO COLLEGE. SO I GUESS,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

30:36.542 --> 30:39.041
YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT.

30:39.041 --> 30:40.667
I'M GOING TO END UP
EXACTLY WHERE YOU
THOUGHT I WOULD.

30:40.667 --> 30:43.041
A COMPLETE
AND UTTER FAILURE.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.375
[BOTH]
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO YOU... ♪

30:51.458 --> 30:52.667
PACE!

30:59.583 --> 31:00.583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:26.250 --> 32:27.834
DATING OR A COUPLE
OR IN A RELATIONSHIP,

32:27.834 --> 32:29.291
BECAUSE SHE WON'T
TELL ME.

32:29.291 --> 32:32.125

CLOSE TO FINDING OUT,
SHE FREAKS.

FOR YOU, DAWSON.

THEIR EMOTIONS CLOSE

32:43.166 --> 32:44.708

EVEN CLOSER,

32:44.708 --> 32:47.708

THEY DON'T CARE,
IT'S JUST...

32:47.708 --> 32:49.291
IT'S BECAUSE THEY
CARE SO MUCH.

32:49.291 --> 32:52.625

THE GOOD NEWS IS,

32:52.625 --> 32:54.959
IS THAT EVENTUALLY
THEY ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH.

32:54.959 --> 32:58.375
HOWEVER, IT'S OFTEN
AFTER YOU'VE...

32:58.375 --> 33:00.875

IGNORED ALL THE SIGNS
THAT THEY'VE BEEN SUFFERING.

FAULT PACEY DIDN'T
GET INTO COLLEGE.

THAT HE THINKS THAT
HE DISAPPOINTED ME,

FOR YOU.

BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES.

CHARACTER FLAW.

PROBABLY JUST GO BACK.

FROM A HOUSE BOAT

TOLD THIS TO ANYONE...

HUNT YOU DOWN IF YOU
BREATHE IT TO A SOUL.

THAT I'VE BEEN HARD ON YOU
ABOUT SCHOOL, AND, UH...

35:12.000 --> 35:14.291

I DON'T THINK

YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH
TO GO OR TO GET IN.

THAT YOU'RE MEANT
TO DO GREAT THINGS...
