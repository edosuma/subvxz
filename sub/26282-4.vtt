WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.987
-Previously on The Resident...
-AUSTIN:
Dr. Okafor frightens me.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.923
-I want her to be my right hand.
-My thoughts exactly.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.059
-BELL: Ms. Booth works
for QuoVadis Labs.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.727
It's a cutting-edge
medical device company.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.430
Medical devices
are even bigger than pharma.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.432
Pacemakers, cochlear implants...

00:31.465 --> 00:33.101
CONRAD:
The kid was dying.
I had to cut.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.436
You don't make the decision
to cut. I decide that.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.570
BELL:
Tell me exactly what happened.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.772
Who made the first cut--
you or Conrad Hawkins?

00:38.806 --> 00:42.042
-MAN: Marshall is our new
chairman of the board.
-It's time to put this hospital

00:42.076 --> 00:44.845
on a firm financial footing.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.115
Stick to what you know,
and leave the business

00:47.148 --> 00:48.582
to the big boys.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.050
BELL:
You better open your eyes.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.185
He's certainly here
to scorch the earth.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.453
MARSHALL:
You're a lot more like me

00:52.486 --> 00:53.921
than you realize.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.925
NAOMI:
State your name for the record.

00:57.958 --> 01:01.395
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.631
You understand
that you're under oath?

01:03.664 --> 01:06.267
I do.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.436
Remember: "yes," "no,"

01:08.469 --> 01:09.803
"I don't recall."

01:12.973 --> 01:16.577
Where were you on the first day
that you encountered my client?

01:18.146 --> 01:19.547
* All right, here we go *

01:19.580 --> 01:21.582
* Hello, stranger *

01:28.456 --> 01:30.391
CONRAD:
When did the dizziness start?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.826
About 15 minutes ago.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.128
Aw, you're just
a little dehydrated.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.096
I should have you back out
before the encore.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.998
You said volunteers got in free.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.933
And here you are.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.969
In the parking lot.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.604
What'd you think--
you'd be onstage with the bands?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.406
DEVON:
I thought I'd me able
to see the bands.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.607
-The bathrooms have
a better view.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.643
Then drink your way
to a bathroom break.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.948
Ah, good, we can use
some extra hands.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.418
Sorry, but I am here
for this guy.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.453
-Let's go.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.955
One of the other doctors
called in sick.

02:01.989 --> 02:04.158
-So...
-You took their shift.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.594
Just a couple more hours,
and then I'm all yours.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.496
No, that's fine.
I'm sure, uh, after a few beers,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.798
any guy out there will seem
like a good dance partner.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.033
-I'll dance with you.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.035
Not dehydrated, you won't.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.471
But seriously,
if you guys need help...

02:17.505 --> 02:18.606
MINA:
Go.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.308
Somebody should have
some fun today.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.310
I'll see you later.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.578
I'll find you.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.649
God, I really wanted to see
Scott Weiland live.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.985
Well, that'll be tough,
since he's dead.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.854
You're thinking of the guy
from Soundgarden.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.556
No, that's Chris Cornell.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.725
You're thinking of the guy
from Stone Temple Pilots,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.327
who is Scott Weiland.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.028
They're both dead?

02:41.061 --> 02:42.230
Are you two done?

02:50.371 --> 02:51.839
DEVON:
Oh, my God.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.680
NIC:
Somebody get help!

02:59.713 --> 03:02.716
Nic! Nic!

03:03.884 --> 03:05.886
-The exit's this way, come on!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.824
MAN:
Go, go, go, go!

03:10.858 --> 03:12.560
Nic?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.731
-I found him like this.
No pulse.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.200
-I started compressions.
-Switch.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.902
Yeah.
I'll get help.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.152
*

03:48.662 --> 03:51.599
32-year-old male found down
without a pulse. Now with ROSC.

03:51.632 --> 03:55.403
-Multiple external injuries.
-BP 105/80. Heart rate 110.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.238
-Two liters.
He needs a pan scan.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.773
-Do we have any idea
what happened?
-Radio said

03:59.807 --> 04:02.109
a couple speakers blew, but
everyone thought it was a bomb.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.279
MINA: Blunt abdominal trauma,
hypotensive.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.315
Are ambulances on a level zero?

04:07.348 --> 04:08.916
-Yeah, patients
going all over town.
-Get ready

04:08.949 --> 04:10.083
for a full house, people.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.919
Open-arm fracture
and hemoptysis.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.087
I need another large-bore I.V.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.924
One, two, three.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.327
I heard you need extra hands.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.797
NIC:
Bleeding's controlled.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.232
All right, it's getting
pretty crazy in here,

04:25.265 --> 04:28.436
but, uh, no more
improv surgeries, okay?

04:28.469 --> 04:29.770
Our gunshot kid
during the blackout--

04:29.803 --> 04:32.072
-Yeah, but you barely did.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.274
Bell put me on the spot,

04:34.308 --> 04:36.109
asked me who made the first cut.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.647
What'd you say?

04:40.681 --> 04:41.982
Nothing.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.787
But don't make me cover
for you again, okay?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.522
Thanks.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.292
Dr. Hawkins, they want you
in the VIP room.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.762
Yeah, I'm a little busy.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.330
-Well, someone's got to go.
-DEVON: Hey, I got it.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.805
I was about to go onstage,

05:04.838 --> 05:06.940
play my set.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.976
That's when I heard
that noise.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.778
Is everyone okay?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.312
Let's focus on you
right now, Mr. Barrett.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.549
Looks like you got
stomped on pretty bad.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.151
Actually, I just tripped
backstage.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.323
Is someone in the bathroom?

05:23.357 --> 05:25.225
Hey, Tony.

05:25.258 --> 05:29.029
Doc, this is Tony,
my sober companion.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.531
Tony, this is Doc.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.703
Tony's just making sure
the room's clean.

05:35.736 --> 05:39.373
You'd be surprised what people
leave behind in hotels.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.809
It's a hospital.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.578
Maids leave stuff
all the time.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.981
How long have you been sober,
Mr. Barrett?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.683
Almost a year.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.719
Got to get that chip.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.489
It did get ugly, though.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.025
The more records I sold,
the more drugs I took.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.028
I nearly drank myself to death
a few years ago.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.996
Had to quit the tour,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.198
take some time to dry out.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.436
That show today was supposed
to be my big comeback.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.541
You have a possible
tibia fracture.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.876
While we get your X-rays
we'll get you on oxycodone

06:15.909 --> 06:18.378
-No, no, no, no. No pills.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.848
No booze, nothing.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.384
Only vice I've got left
are these babies.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.719
You want one?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.921
I'm good.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.257
We'll be back.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.962
: Does he seem
a little drunk to you?
-Yes.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.897
Add a blood alcohol test.
Tox, too.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.732
Got it.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.204
Mm. So, Julian,
what do you advise

06:44.237 --> 06:47.407
for an abdominal wall
this well

06:47.441 --> 06:48.742
Try these retractors.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.911
They're non-slip.
Designed for bariatrics.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.649
JESSICA:
I'm glad Prince Abdulraheem

06:55.683 --> 06:57.084
requested you personally,
Dr. Bell.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.319
We miss you down here.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.254
Well, thank you, Jessica.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.824
I love the Saudis.
Ideal patients.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.594
They pay same day,
full price, in cash. Mets.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.095
Pick-ups.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.430
We still on for tonight?

07:10.464 --> 07:12.666
Mm-hmm.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.936
Dr. Bell is meeting
my boss tonight, Gordon Page.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.137
He's throwing a party
for the CEOs

07:17.170 --> 07:18.839
who do business with QuoVadis.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.675
Yeah, I'm betting that a guy
who went from med school dropout

07:21.709 --> 07:23.511
to start-up billionaire
in five years

07:23.544 --> 07:25.746
can entertain like a rock star.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.947
His open bar is epic.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.116
He flies a mixologist in
from Miami Beach.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.620
Oh. If you need
a plus-one, I'm free.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.325
The pick.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.395
("Like No Other Man"
by The Hellacopters playing)

07:49.336 --> 07:51.972
See how we mind
the patellar tendon

07:52.005 --> 07:53.807
as we saw the posterior tibia.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.479
Retractor, please.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.048
SURGICAL RESIDENT:
PCL, right?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.616
That's right.

08:02.650 --> 08:06.153
Oscillating saw's
best to resect damaged areas

08:06.186 --> 08:07.487
of the proximal tibia.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.657
Then we size the implants

08:09.690 --> 08:11.659
and cement the components.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.861
Oh, it's a beautiful
procedure, isn't it?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.996
Go ahead, you try.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.532
Get in there
and do the next cut.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.370
You all right, dear?

08:23.403 --> 08:26.574
* Well, I'm tired, so sick,
tired of breakin' down... *

08:30.844 --> 08:33.647
* When you come around *

08:33.681 --> 08:36.483
* And crossroads, alleys
and empty streets... *

08:52.399 --> 08:54.835
Don't be too hard on yourself.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.170
But time for a gut check.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.072
Not too late to
go into dermatology.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.276
Dr. Bell.
Randolph. My man.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.846
-Make an appointment.
-Amazing thing.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.281
I checked the schedule, and
we're both available right now.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.617
I'm on a much-needed break.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.719
Which you'll share with me.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.287
I let you get away
with this why?

09:14.321 --> 09:15.689
Hmm.

09:15.723 --> 09:19.192
I need to establish better
boundaries with staff.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.729
Why, dear man,
did you assign me

09:21.762 --> 09:24.632
yet another moist towelette
of a resident?

09:24.665 --> 09:27.868
What, Coleman? He graduated
Baylor at the top of his class.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.070
He nearly fainted in my OR.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.606
We're a teaching hospital.
Teach him, he can learn.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.476
Who's this douche?

09:36.509 --> 09:38.746
Head of the hottest new medical
device company in the country.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.448
Also the most eligible bachelor,
I'm told.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.716
Oh, come on, Bell.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.252
We all know you're
the most eligible bachelor.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.555
All our residents are standouts,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.891
or they wouldn't be at Chastain.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.093
I love Atlanta.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.928
The street art, the craft beer.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.930
A rough-but-ready Irishman

09:56.964 --> 10:00.433
in Buckhead I've been
spending a lot of time with.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.602
But have you seen the
surgical suites at Walter Reed?

10:02.636 --> 10:05.605
Mayo and Stanford
keep calling, too.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.075
I-I don't know how
they all get my number.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.645
I may be able to find you
a replacement.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.316
What

10:19.452 --> 10:21.421
A piece of bone.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.992
Ah. It's an occupational hazard.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.028
Keep me happy, Randolph.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.465
What's your full name?

10:32.499 --> 10:33.967
Josh Robinson.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.136
Do you remember where you were
when you lost consciousness?

10:36.169 --> 10:37.938
Uh, at a concert in the park.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.341
Reviewing your chart, you've had
quite the interesting life.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.810
How did you get
so many injuries?

10:42.843 --> 10:47.781
Uh, well, this one,
heli-rafting in Queenstown.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.818
Um, mountain biking in Morocco.

10:50.851 --> 10:54.121
Heat stroke, passed out.
And, uh...

10:54.154 --> 10:55.655
Death Drop in Zambia,
two years ago.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.157
Still can't bend it right.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.059
Someone knows how to use
their vacation time.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.728
I'm a professional
adventure guide.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.730
-Yeah.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.597
I just took a group free diving.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.567
-NIC: Wow.
-CONRAD: Oh, nice.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.502
You on any medications?

11:09.536 --> 11:12.740
Uh, yeah. It's in my bag.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.907
Oh, there it is.

11:13.941 --> 11:17.310
-No.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.678
CONRAD:
You have injuries
to mark your experiences.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.013
I get tattoos to mark mine.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.515
NIC:
I don't see
any prescription drugs.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.018
These are all supplements.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.686
Oh, Pharma. Bad juju.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.255
CONRAD:
Josh.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.524
Do not get me started
on Big Pharma.

11:31.558 --> 11:34.594
NIC:
Milk thistle,
kava kava, omega-3.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.596
Ironic you take all these
supplements to stay healthy

11:36.629 --> 11:39.499
and you end up stampeded
by a bunch of drunk music fans.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.369
Stampede

11:42.402 --> 11:44.704
NAOMI:
And that's when
you realized that my client

11:44.738 --> 11:47.607
-Yes.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.011
And how many patients did you
treat that day, Dr. Hawkins?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.546
I don't recall.

11:53.580 --> 11:57.384
More than five

11:59.086 --> 12:01.889
I'll tell you. 20.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.025
Chastain strictly adheres
to ACGME guidelines.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.626
How can one resident
possibly provide

12:06.659 --> 12:08.295
the standard of care
to that many patients?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.897
We do it every day.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.401
REPORTER:
Disturbing footage today

12:14.434 --> 12:16.036
from the Hotlanta
Music Festival.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.238
CONRAD:
Liver and kidneys
have seen better days.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.706
History of Crohn's, too.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.409
So, lots of signs
of the rock star life.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.811
I'm worried the swelling
from his injury could cause

12:23.844 --> 12:25.412
too much pressure in his leg.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.714
Could lead to poor blood flow
and muscle necrosis.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.917
Compartment syndrome. So if
we don't relieve the pressure,

12:29.950 --> 12:31.551
he'll lose the leg.
What's your plan?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.921
Fasciotomy. I had Ortho come
check his pressures.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.823
-Good.
-They're only at 20.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.590
Well, watch it closely.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.426
If it hits 30, they'll need
to operate right away.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.394
Which is why I have him
on the OR's radar.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.731
But the anesthesiologist said
he'd like to have him sober.

12:44.764 --> 12:49.169
Well, his blood alcohol
concentration is .04.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.838
Give him a few hours.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.673
He says that he hasn't
had a drink in a year.

12:53.706 --> 12:56.743
But his serum alcohol level
tells us he did.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.280
Tests don't lie. Alcoholics do.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.316
Yeah, maybe
sober companions, too.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.691
How does one man
take all of these?

13:11.724 --> 13:12.860
Those are just the supplements

13:12.893 --> 13:13.961
that our adventure guide
remembers taking.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.462
Kava kava was banned in Europe

13:15.495 --> 13:16.796
for causing liver toxicity.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.465
That might explain
all the bleeding,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.533
-but not why he passed out.
-If I had to guess,

13:20.567 --> 13:22.535
supplements and dehydration
caused an arrhythmia.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.637
-Knocked him out.
-MAN: I'm glad you called.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.874
My firm has over 50 years
of experience

13:26.907 --> 13:28.375
with neck injuries, right?

13:28.408 --> 13:31.311
You say the ER doctor
didn't even order an MRI?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.713
That's malpractice.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.884
You know, I'm all for patients'
rights, but doctors' jobs

13:36.917 --> 13:39.386
are hard enough
without these vulture lawyers.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.221
And who gets sued the most?
ER doctors.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.223
Patients need to be able to sue.
It's their only recourse

13:43.256 --> 13:45.725
-for medical error.
-It's abused, and it leads

13:45.758 --> 13:47.861
to cover-our-asses overtreatment
and overtesting.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.562
Forcing doctors to practice
defensive medicine.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.664
Well, let's just focus
on our patients

13:51.698 --> 13:53.700
and ignore the vultures.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.712
Thank you.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.882
I understand that you and Nurse
Nevin are in a relationship.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.251
-That's irrelevant.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.920
NAOMI:
Do you think working
with your girlfriend

14:12.953 --> 14:15.188
could possibly have affected
your performance?

14:15.222 --> 14:16.924
Objection. Argumentative.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.760
No. Never. There is no better
nurse practitioner than Nic.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.930
Your client was lucky
to have her.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.966
Wouldn't you agree, Josh?

14:28.468 --> 14:30.203
:
Easy.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.771
NAOMI:
Isn't it true

14:31.804 --> 14:33.206
that you have a history

14:33.240 --> 14:37.077
of deviating from protocol?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.548
I know what you're trying to do.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.750
You're suggesting I put
my patient at risk,

14:43.783 --> 14:48.255
but you don't know a damn thing
about medicine.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.158
Let's take five.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.065
-Conrad.
-I know, I messed up.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.299
I don't need
to hear it from you.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.268
This lawsuit
could end your career.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.937
You could even be found
personally liable.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.905
And the hospital
won't stand by you.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.408
Not everyone at Chastain
is on your side.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.978
-Yes.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.413
You have no idea
what this is like for me.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.815
I know exactly
what this is like.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.284
I get sued all the time.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.986
Yeah, you probably win
every single one,

15:19.019 --> 15:20.320
no matter what you say or do.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.654
Oh, don't be naive.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.756
What happened doesn't matter.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.727
A doctor can do everything
right, and still get screwed.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.998
Just control your emotions,

15:31.031 --> 15:34.167
and let the lawyers
do their job.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.970
I have to tell the truth,
no matter what.

15:37.004 --> 15:40.373
Then you'll lose.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.677
Maybe.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.824
AUSTIN:
This metalhead is lucky
you brought her to me.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.028
That paper-thin portal vein

16:01.061 --> 16:03.663
could easily be ripped
by a mere mortal.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.466
MINA:
I can do the Pringle Maneuver.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.535
AUSTIN:
I can do it better.
Observe. Right angle.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.003
MINA:
Well, I've done it before,

16:10.037 --> 16:11.638
-flawlessly.
-Well, if there's nothing

16:11.671 --> 16:14.974
left for you to learn,
Dr. Okafor, why are you here?

16:15.008 --> 16:17.210
Good question.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.846
PAUL:
Pressure's still dropping.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.149
MINA:
We must have another bleeder
in there somewhere.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.517
-Give me another right angle.
-She's losing too much blood.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.719
-Let me help.
-Too many cooks.

16:26.753 --> 16:30.157
Can we think about the safety
of the patient and not your ego?

16:30.190 --> 16:33.226
AUSTIN:
Yeah, in the words
of my colleague Dr. Seuss,

16:33.260 --> 16:36.996
"With this brain in my head
and this blade in my hand,

16:37.030 --> 16:40.900
I shall save every man, woman
and child in the land."

16:40.933 --> 16:43.570
-That is not Dr. Seuss.
-It's an adaptation.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.873
Let me break it down, Okafor:
my house, my rules.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.744
Pressure's coming back up.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.680
AUSTIN:
Course it is.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.915
Oh, it's so good to be king.

16:55.948 --> 16:59.552
I'm getting sick of the king
treating me like his valet.

17:01.788 --> 17:06.426
I'll tell you what:
you can close.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.765
Your life can change
in a moment.

17:12.799 --> 17:17.437
Levi was born with
a congenital corneal disease.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.073
He'd never seen his mom,

17:20.107 --> 17:22.109
until a synthetic cornea

17:22.142 --> 17:25.545
from QuoVadis made it possible.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.447
Utilizing advanced
nanotechnology,

17:27.480 --> 17:31.451
we provided better bio
integration, quicker healing...

17:31.484 --> 17:33.553
I don't like being summoned.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.088
You see, at QuoVadis,

17:35.122 --> 17:37.724
we measure our success

17:37.757 --> 17:40.227
by how much we improve
the quality of people's lives.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.429
Which is why I'm so passionate

17:42.462 --> 17:44.797
about our latest
breakthrough device:

17:44.831 --> 17:49.169
a safer, a more effective
vagus nerve stimulator.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.806
Remember that rep serving free
lunch with her device demos?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.808
-AUSTIN: Mm.
-This is her boss.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.112
He's barely 30. His company
valued at $4 billion.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.480
He's a salesman, Dr. Bell.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.981
The first thing they sell
is themselves.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.418
This talk of his
has over a million hits.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.653
I find it quite moving.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.087
What am I doing here?

18:08.121 --> 18:10.257
Oh, I'm assigning you to Ortho.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.660
Ha. Bell just made a funny.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.662
MINA:
I-I am not changing
my residency.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.664
Well, no one said you were.
You're just rotating

18:17.697 --> 18:19.299
through a different
surgical specialty.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.667
This is a teaching hospital,
and when we said,

18:20.700 --> 18:21.968
"See One, Do One, Teach One,"

18:22.001 --> 18:25.138
we didn't literally mean
just one.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.140
See mine, do mine, be mine.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.608
Okafor belongs to me.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.178
I belong to no one.
I chose general surgery.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.813
Me, not you.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.484
Well, my bad, Dr. Bell.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
I now see the value
in Okafor doing a dance

18:39.219 --> 18:41.020
with our friends in Ortho.

18:41.053 --> 18:44.391
Happy hammering.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.175
Dr. Okafor, lovely to meet you.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.043
You come highly recommended.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.046
What did Dr. Austin really say?

19:07.079 --> 19:09.216
That you're extremely demanding,

19:09.249 --> 19:11.518
and in need
of an attitude adjustment.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.820
Also too talented for Ortho,

19:13.853 --> 19:16.489
which he called
glorified carpentry.

19:16.523 --> 19:20.193
That was rude of him,
but accurate.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.731
You know what's beautiful
about Ortho?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.400
When something is broken,
we fix it.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.169
First up, full hip replacement.

19:30.203 --> 19:33.573
Shall we go and give the patient
the ability to walk again?

19:38.245 --> 19:41.348
-Come on, just let it go.
Relax, relax.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.849
LFTs just came in.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.751
Let me guess.
Alcoholic liver disease?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.185
Early stage.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.687
INGRID:
Relax, relax, let it go.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.389
Ingrid, what's going on?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.090
We're having a party.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.260
Are you sure all he's had
are IV fluids?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.262
INGRID:
Oh, I never took my eyes
off him, I swear.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.763
Does this thing
have a gas pedal?

19:58.598 --> 20:01.734
Hey. What'd you slip him?

20:01.768 --> 20:04.036
A drink

20:04.070 --> 20:06.806
Let me have a look at that leg.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.744
I'm not drunk.
I'm sober as a judge.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.413
Pressure's too high.
We can't wait.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.914
DEVON:
All right, we need
to get him up to surgery,

20:14.947 --> 20:18.084
or he'll lose his leg. Let's go.

20:18.117 --> 20:22.622
It's his leg, but if he keeps
drinking, it won't matter.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.961
KIT:
You're up.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.564
You want me to do the impaction?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.833
Mm-hmm.

20:42.275 --> 20:46.346
This hip replacement needs
to be attached firmly.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.920
Think of something
bothering you.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.590
Pissed you got reassigned?
Get out those frustrations.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.133
The news reports said
hundreds of people

21:07.166 --> 21:08.935
were injured at the concert,

21:08.968 --> 21:12.271
most of them seriously, so why
am I only seeing 40 admits?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.673
Where are the brain injuries,
the skull fractures,

21:13.706 --> 21:14.941
the ICU admissions?

21:14.974 --> 21:16.509
My understanding is

21:16.543 --> 21:18.811
the serious cases
all went to Atlanta General.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.947
All of them?
We're a level-1 trauma center.

21:20.980 --> 21:25.151
Why are the EMTs not sending us
the serious cases?

21:25.184 --> 21:28.120
Because Atlanta General
has a new EMT lounge.

21:28.154 --> 21:31.023
They have a 72-inch TV
with sports channels

21:31.057 --> 21:33.693
and a popcorn machine
with real butter.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.295
They have a lounge
just for the EMTs?

21:36.329 --> 21:39.131
I heard Trinity Memorial
is building a better one.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.033
We don't even give them
stale bagels.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.703
It's no wonder the ambulances
are going elsewhere.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.505
Give us the room.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.717
Maybe it's time you start
doing your job

21:57.750 --> 22:01.388
and let someone else cut open
obese Saudi princes.

22:01.421 --> 22:05.358
He requested the chief
of surgery which...

22:05.392 --> 22:07.159
is me.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.562
I've been doing due diligence
for the board.

22:09.596 --> 22:12.031
Our costs are rising

22:12.064 --> 22:14.066
and our profit margins
are shrinking.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.068
Yeah, which is why
I have a meeting

22:16.102 --> 22:17.904
with Gordon Page tonight.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.339
Let me guess,
Chastain agrees to use

22:20.373 --> 22:22.542
only QuoVadis medical devices

22:22.575 --> 22:25.077
and in exchange,
Gordon gives us...

22:25.111 --> 22:28.748
A 20% price cut to boost
our profit margins.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.884
Strong deal for both sides.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.420
I need a better one.

22:33.453 --> 22:36.055
I've already told the board

22:36.088 --> 22:39.426
not to worry because if you
can't land Gordon, I will.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.538
I didn't have time
to go home and change.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.607
Is this too wrinkled?

22:54.641 --> 22:56.776
-No.
-Thanks.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.945
There isn't a full-length mirror
in the ladies room.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.380
I'll get right on that.

23:01.414 --> 23:04.250
This party of Gordon's
is a big deal.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.385
I don't get a lot of face time
with him. He's too busy.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.220
I want to make
a good impression.

23:08.254 --> 23:09.422
Oh, come on,
Gordon can't be tougher

23:09.456 --> 23:11.958
than some of these doctors
at Chastain.

23:11.991 --> 23:16.128
And you've been winning us over
since you walked in that door.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.597
You got this.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.466
I hope so. If I can be the one

23:19.499 --> 23:21.568
to bring Gordon
and Bell together,

23:21.601 --> 23:25.605
I could be looking at a bonus,
which I really need.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.607
I'm helping my parents put my
little sister through college.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.142
You're gonna do great, Julian.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.612
Thanks.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.981
Oh, hey,
could you do me a favor?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.415
Sure.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.951
I heard you're treating
Rhys Barrett in VIP.

23:38.985 --> 23:42.922
If I confirmed that,
I would be violating HIPAA.

23:42.955 --> 23:46.025
Just blink if he's here.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.998
My parents would not stop
playing his albums

23:52.031 --> 23:53.766
when I was a kid;
his songs are basically

23:53.800 --> 23:55.001
the only ones I knew

23:55.034 --> 23:56.435
until I dropped out
of high school.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.837
I'm still not telling you.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.171
Pretty please.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.439
Wait, you dropped out?

24:00.473 --> 24:02.509
I went back.
Anyway, I'll always have

24:02.542 --> 24:03.976
a special place in my heart
for Rhys.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.278
I know he hasn't toured
for years.

24:06.312 --> 24:08.848
Drugs and alcohol, I guess,
which is such a shame,

24:08.881 --> 24:11.851
but I will always be a fan.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.220
I'd love to meet him.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.931
BELL:
So who's my
biggest competition?

24:24.964 --> 24:28.334
Trinity Memorial beats you
on cochlear implants by 15%

24:28.367 --> 24:30.970
but doesn't come close
on caths or aortic valves.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.639
St. John's will make a play.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.273
Yes, but with the VNS,

24:34.306 --> 24:37.176
Gordon wants high-volume
pilot hospitals.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.645
-More patients, better outcomes.
-Well, for a guy

24:38.678 --> 24:41.781
who just moved to Atlanta,
he certainly has settled in.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.188
JULIAN:
Gordon.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.523
I'd like to introduce you
to the CEO of Chastain,

24:50.557 --> 24:53.125
-Dr. Randolph Bell...
-Randolph Bell.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.194
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Dr. Bell.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.196
Hope Julian here
has made herself useful.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.631
BELL:
Oh, she's been invaluable.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.533
So I've done some reading
on your vagus nerve stimulator.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.801
Is it everything I hear?

25:01.834 --> 25:05.204
More. Yeah, we just wrapped
our European trials.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.539
It exceeded
all our expectations.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.340
We're gonna help so many people.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.009
Well, I'd love to see the data
from those trials.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.178
Previous VNS stimulators
have all had issues.

25:12.211 --> 25:15.014
Not ours. But we'd value
your thoughts.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.816
-MAN: Hey, Gordon.
-Ooh.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.184
Can I introduce you
to the governor?

25:18.217 --> 25:19.552
He's on our board.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.888
His son suffers
from refractory seizures,

25:21.921 --> 25:23.522
so we might have
some answers for him.

25:23.556 --> 25:26.225
Governor.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.232
You're even better
than your reputation.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.401
I need opportunities
to hone my skills.

25:35.434 --> 25:37.704
Lately, Dr. Austin
would rather show off his.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.907
AJ does seem like
a grade-A narcissist.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.743
He's also the most brilliant
surgeon I've ever seen.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.511
No offense.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.513
Well, you haven't
got to know me yet.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.918
There are things I can teach you
even the Raptor doesn't know.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.419
I'm listening.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.890
*

26:06.465 --> 26:09.101
And one for you,
fresh from Havana.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.103
Thank you.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.940
Awful, what happened today
at that music festival.

26:13.973 --> 26:17.276
Yeah, thank God no one died.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.878
You know,
you're the only CEO here

26:18.911 --> 26:20.246
who didn't tell me
in the first two minutes

26:20.279 --> 26:21.547
how much they made from it.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.116
Well, don't give me
too much credit.

26:24.150 --> 26:27.954
To be perfectly frank,
we didn't do so well.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.122
I'm impressed by your honesty.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.558
I'm interested
to know more about you.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.927
Were your parents in medicine?

26:34.961 --> 26:38.765
My parents...

26:38.798 --> 26:41.801
ran a hardware store
on Peachtree.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.402
Worked seven days a week,

26:43.435 --> 26:44.804
not that it
got them anything.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.939
-You know,

26:46.973 --> 26:48.140
I just wanted
them to wake up one day

26:48.174 --> 26:49.475
and not have to go in,

26:49.508 --> 26:52.111
not have a job to do,
no bills to worry about.

26:52.144 --> 26:56.148
And being a doctor seemed like

26:56.182 --> 26:59.151
the hardest, best thing
I could become.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.953
I'd have the power
to change their lives and...

27:00.987 --> 27:03.522
Did you?

27:06.192 --> 27:09.461
Well, they died while
I was still a resident.

27:09.495 --> 27:12.832
They'd be proud
if they could see you now.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.300
Look at you.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.268
You're at the top of your game.

27:16.302 --> 27:20.973
-Well, I'm not done yet.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.642
Look, I want Chastain
to handle the launch of your VNS

27:23.676 --> 27:25.812
and-and I want us to negotiate

27:25.845 --> 27:28.180
a financial relationship
that benefits us both.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.349
I'm talking to several CEOs
who want the same.

27:30.382 --> 27:33.185
Tonight? Enjoy the party.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.722
I'm not ready
to make my decision.

27:40.392 --> 27:43.629
DEVON:
They fixed his leg,
but get this:

27:43.662 --> 27:46.532
Rhys's blood alcohol
actually rose during surgery.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.967
He's telling the truth.
He's not drinking.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.136
Which means to save his liver,

27:50.169 --> 27:51.537
we have to figure out
what's really going on.

27:51.570 --> 27:52.538
And...?

27:52.571 --> 27:53.806
There's no explanation.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.876
And what?
We've been watching him.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.845
The only thing he's put
in his mouth is licorice.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.412
CONRAD:
And?

28:06.252 --> 28:09.321
Those vines--
they're pure sugar.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.723
I'm gonna order an EGD.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.165
You snowboarded down a volcano?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.400
-Yeah, I did.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.235
You're a hell of a risk-taker.
I respect that.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.337
You guys ever take, uh,
adventure vacations?

28:25.371 --> 28:26.873
Last year I went to Rwanda

28:26.906 --> 28:27.874
to volunteer
with Partners in Health.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.575
That's the kind
of vacation I like.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.543
Yeah, he slept in a tent, made
friends with the village goat.

28:31.577 --> 28:34.346
Yeah, they gave him
to me as a gift.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.282
They had this whole amazing
ceremony and everything,

28:36.315 --> 28:37.416
but obviously,
I couldn't take him with me.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.551
Hmm. And when Conrad left,
they ate him.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.552
No.

28:40.586 --> 28:41.888
I don't like to talk
about that part.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.726
Wait a second.
What's going on here?

28:49.796 --> 28:51.397
NAOMI:
Mr. Robinson's arm had a clot.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.265
-Yes.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.267
I suspected disseminated
intravascular coagulation.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.436
It's a blood disorder
that causes

28:57.469 --> 28:59.038
simultaneous
clotting and bleeding.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.773
Why did you think DIC?

29:00.807 --> 29:02.942
The liver toxicity
from the supplements combined

29:02.975 --> 29:04.777
with the traumatic injuries
from being trampled

29:04.811 --> 29:06.412
used up his blood's
clotting factors.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.214
His blood work
later confirmed it.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.049
This is life-threatening,
correct?

29:10.082 --> 29:11.117
It can be.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.584
So you alerted your attending?

29:12.618 --> 29:14.086
I did not alert my attending

29:14.120 --> 29:16.588
because Mr. Robinson was stable.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.825
The next step
was to remove the clot.

29:20.793 --> 29:24.063
Continue advancing
the cath to the cloth.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.733
And this is where
we confirm placement?

29:27.766 --> 29:30.402
Yes. Inject contrast.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.271
Once we get this clot,

29:32.304 --> 29:34.273
we'll go down and
get the one in your leg.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.641
So, you're saying
what's wrong with me

29:35.674 --> 29:37.143
was caused by my supplements?

29:37.176 --> 29:38.744
Aspirating.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.813
NIC:
Ah, it's an easy mistake.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.281
Supplements are
completely unregulated.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.816
People hear "natural"
and they think safe.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.051
-Good.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.824
-I want to monitor you

29:51.858 --> 29:54.160
on low-dose heparin before you
go back to conquering the world.

29:54.193 --> 29:57.997
Thanks, man.
You're a great doctor.

29:58.030 --> 30:02.301
-And if any of y-y-you...

30:02.334 --> 30:04.603
:
What's happening?

30:04.636 --> 30:05.771
Slurred speech.
Right-sided weakness.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.473
There might be another clot
in his brain.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.508
We need to get him to CT now.

30:16.983 --> 30:20.286
How you doing, Josh?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.621
Okay, one more minute.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.456
Josh's heart rate's slowing.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.792
NIC:
His respirations are irregular.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.594
And severe hypertension.
Cushing's triad.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.366
That's not a clot.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.035
That's a massive hemorrhage.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.070
He needs surgical decompression.
Page Neurosurgery.

30:42.408 --> 30:45.244
-He's starting to seize.
-His ICP's going up.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.714
-In a resection.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.149
It'll be another ten minutes.

30:50.182 --> 30:53.052
No, that's too late.
We need him now.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.554
-Left pupil's blown.
-He'll never make it.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.326
How long did you wait
for Dr. Jacobs?

31:00.359 --> 31:03.162
The CTs show that
Mr. Robinson's hemorrhage

31:03.195 --> 31:04.263
would have rendered him
brain-dead.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.672
We have a right to know how long
Dr. Hawkins waited for Neuro

31:13.705 --> 31:15.441
before taking matters
into his own hands.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.681
It was an emergency.
He wasn't watching a clock.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.882
Ju... Move on.

31:30.789 --> 31:32.091
The burr should've
been performed

31:32.124 --> 31:33.759
by a trained neurosurgeon
in the OR,

31:33.792 --> 31:35.427
not a third-year in the hallway,

31:35.461 --> 31:37.429
where my client was more likely
to contract the meningitis

31:37.463 --> 31:39.098
that would put him
on a long road to recovery.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.100
I had done them in Afghanistan.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.401
You're not on a battlefield,
Dr. Hawkins.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.535
Now answer the question.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.171
Seconds?

31:48.274 --> 31:49.741
Think back.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.978
How long did you wait?

31:56.648 --> 31:59.151
-I didn't.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.800
DEVON:
Scrapings from your
stomach lining

32:14.833 --> 32:16.802
stained positive
for an overgrowth of fungus.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.105
Something called A.B.S.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.772
I have abs?

32:20.806 --> 32:22.408
Auto-brewery syndrome.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.977
Sounds fun,
but I'm guessing it's not.

32:25.011 --> 32:28.480
One cause of A.B.S.
is consuming so much alcohol

32:28.514 --> 32:31.650
in the past that yeast
builds up in the stomach.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.653
That yeast now turns carbs
into alcohol.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.922
I'm making beer inside me?

32:36.955 --> 32:40.292
Yeah, and these were making it
worse because sugars are carbs.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.828
Well, they ought to put that
on the label.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.663
We'll get you on an antifungal.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.932
Cut carbs, stick to meat
and vegetables.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.801
In a few hours,
you'll be sober again, for real.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.837
Did you say, uh, low carbs

32:51.870 --> 32:53.872
or no carbs?

33:03.082 --> 33:05.084
(indistinct announcement
on P.A.)

33:08.487 --> 33:11.157
You can thank me later.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.791
For?

33:12.824 --> 33:14.960
For talking to Bell tomorrow
and persuading him

33:14.993 --> 33:17.463
to send you home to my OR.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.966
I don't want those hands
picking up any bad habits.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.203
I'm fine where I am.

33:27.406 --> 33:30.376
My mentor, Dr. Abe Benedict,

33:30.409 --> 33:32.811
studied under DeBakey himself.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.313
It's a sacred lineage,

33:34.346 --> 33:37.316
a genealogy of giants,

33:37.349 --> 33:39.385
and you belong in that line.

33:39.418 --> 33:43.722
I'm not interested
in being in your

33:43.755 --> 33:46.058
line of giants.
I am the first

33:46.092 --> 33:48.694
of my own line-- an ancestor,

33:48.727 --> 33:50.929
not your descendant.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.938
*

34:08.780 --> 34:10.749
How's the low

34:10.782 --> 34:13.885
I'll take it.

34:13.919 --> 34:16.755
Good news is you'll recover.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.526
And so will your liver...
if you stay clean.

34:20.559 --> 34:24.430
I will. Thanks, Doc.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.266
You all right?

34:28.300 --> 34:29.935
Yeah.

34:29.968 --> 34:34.440
I was pretty far gone
before I met Tony.

34:34.473 --> 34:38.244
Honestly, I don't think
he thought I'd make it.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.046
He couldn't get through to me,

34:41.079 --> 34:44.116
but in the end, my fans did.

34:44.150 --> 34:48.754
I started getting all these
tweets and DMs, letters.

34:48.787 --> 34:52.291
I never realized
how much they cared.

34:52.324 --> 34:55.627
Saved my life.

34:55.661 --> 34:59.097
But some of them got hurt
at the park today.

34:59.131 --> 35:02.634
Accidents happen.
It's not your fault.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.069
I just wanted so badly

35:04.102 --> 35:07.072
to hit that stage again,

35:07.105 --> 35:09.475
to feel that crowd out there.

35:09.508 --> 35:13.812
People who actually came
to hear me play--

35:13.845 --> 35:15.781
I let them down.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.150
No. No, you didn't.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.852
Feels like it.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.800
-Dr. Okafor's a natural.
-Give her a week.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.502
She'll be missing

35:36.535 --> 35:39.004
the delicate artistry
of our body's vital organs.

35:39.037 --> 35:43.108
-You're worried I'll ruin her.
-She's an artist,

35:43.141 --> 35:46.445
likely to become one of the
great cardiothoracic surgeons

35:46.478 --> 35:49.181
of her generation.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.550
Don't take that from her.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.356
Did you ever think maybe
the best decision

35:57.389 --> 35:59.525
is her decision?

36:13.004 --> 36:15.040
You said we're going
to the cafeteria.

36:15.073 --> 36:18.477
I lied.
I had a better idea.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.712
Because this hospital
was founded on a simple idea:

36:20.746 --> 36:23.349
improve the health
and well-being

36:23.382 --> 36:25.517
of Atlanta, and today,

36:25.551 --> 36:27.219
Chastain's commitment
to this community

36:27.253 --> 36:29.154
is as strong as ever,

36:29.187 --> 36:31.823
which is why we are forgiving
the medical bills

36:31.857 --> 36:34.660
of every single patient of ours

36:34.693 --> 36:37.162
who's been affected
by this tragedy.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.131
And we're asking all Atlanta
hospitals to do the same.

36:46.272 --> 36:49.541
And we have a really special
surprise for you.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.045
Mr. Rhys, I'm Dr. Bell.
Thank you.

36:54.079 --> 36:57.048
They're all yours.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.917
What do you think?

36:58.950 --> 37:02.721
Good enough place
for a comeback?

37:02.754 --> 37:05.791
You've earned it.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.098
I know some of you

37:13.131 --> 37:15.634
have been knocked down
and you're-you're hurting.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.106
This is a song about
how we can help each other

37:21.139 --> 37:23.609
get back up.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.112
* I did everything I could *

37:29.648 --> 37:32.050
* I did everything *

37:32.083 --> 37:34.553
* I thought I should *

37:34.586 --> 37:37.222
* I closed my eyes
so I could see *

37:37.255 --> 37:41.092
-Not bad.

37:41.126 --> 37:44.796
* But in the dark
I could not breathe *

37:47.265 --> 37:52.237
* I screamed
until I had no voice *

37:52.270 --> 37:55.807
* I screamed and then I had *

37:55.841 --> 37:57.275
* No choice... *

37:57.309 --> 37:59.611
So you couldn't tell me before
that Rhys was here,

37:59.645 --> 38:01.313
but now you can tell
the whole world?

38:01.347 --> 38:02.814
I didn't call them.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.150
Bell probably wanted
his philanthropy televised.

38:05.183 --> 38:08.354
He always brings out his best
self in front of the cameras.

38:13.459 --> 38:16.495
Forgiving patient bills
won't cost us much.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.130
How much will
the other hospitals lose?

38:19.164 --> 38:20.966
Millions.

38:20.999 --> 38:25.303
And I hear the EMT lounge you're
building puts theirs to shame.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.773
Oh, it'll pay for itself
in a month.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.441
How about Gordon?

38:29.475 --> 38:32.277
I'm closing in on him.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.213
* Home again *

38:37.215 --> 38:39.351
* I screamed *

38:39.385 --> 38:42.521
* Until I had no voice *

38:42.554 --> 38:44.289
* I screamed *

38:44.322 --> 38:48.360
* And then I had no choice *

38:48.394 --> 38:52.297
* Signs along the road
are hard to see... *

38:52.330 --> 38:55.967
-Not out of the woods yet.

38:56.001 --> 38:59.371
NIC:
At least he has
a fighting chance.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.139
* Hey *

39:01.172 --> 39:04.309
* Carry me back,
carry me back... *

39:04.342 --> 39:08.213
You only came to that festival
to see me, didn't you?

39:08.246 --> 39:10.215
Because I volunteered
on our day off.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.550
That's not true.
I love live music.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.485
You never go with me.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.722
'Cause you sway the whole time.
It's like being on a boat.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.490
-It's annoying.
-I do not sway.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.992
You're a swayer.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.561
Really?

39:22.594 --> 39:24.896
Yeah.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.365
All right, well,
now you're swaying.

39:27.399 --> 39:31.336
* From myself... *

39:31.369 --> 39:34.005
I won't make the same mistakes.
I will make time for us.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.407
We're busy.

39:35.441 --> 39:39.711
We both know what we
signed up for, but I will, too.

39:39.745 --> 39:43.248
* Set me free *

39:43.281 --> 39:46.251
* Yeah, you... *

39:46.284 --> 39:48.687
CONRAD:
Every day, doctors
make decisions.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.923
Sometimes they're hard,
sometimes they're easy, but...

39:51.957 --> 39:55.894
this is one of the easy ones.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.129
Josh is here
because I took a risk.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.469
I broke a rule to save a life,
and if I hadn't, he'd be dead.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.640
But...

40:11.577 --> 40:12.911
...you know that.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.485
We're done here.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.607
MARSHALL:
You were right.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.811
And it's time I stop
telling you what to do.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.946
Will this be harder to win
at trial? Yes.

40:47.979 --> 40:52.150
But we are both fighters.
We will win this your way, son.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.786
And I will be with you
every step of the way,

40:54.820 --> 40:57.188
if you will let me.

41:02.193 --> 41:03.662
Thank you.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.686
I get it.

41:27.719 --> 41:31.356
A doctor saves you,
you come home grateful,

41:31.389 --> 41:34.860
but rehab gets hard,
money dries up

41:34.893 --> 41:36.862
and your future
doesn't look like

41:36.895 --> 41:39.330
you hoped it would.
Soon, the doctor

41:39.364 --> 41:42.300
who stuck his neck out
to save your ass

41:42.333 --> 41:43.869
starts to represent
an opportunity.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.837
It's not personal.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.674
It is for me.
Conrad's my son.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.877
So here's what happens next.

41:51.910 --> 41:56.715
I am having a nondisclosure
agreement drawn up as we speak.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.050
It will be delivered to you
within the hour,

41:59.084 --> 42:01.186
along with a generous check.

42:01.219 --> 42:04.222
It is an off-the-record
settlement

42:04.255 --> 42:07.559
that Conrad
will never know about.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.060
You will sign it.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.897
My son will be in the cafeteria
getting a coffee

42:11.930 --> 42:14.165
before his next shift.

42:14.199 --> 42:17.235
You are going to go find him,
apologize,

42:17.268 --> 42:21.239
tell him you will not
be taking a dime,

42:21.272 --> 42:23.408
shake his hand, and leave.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.410
-Mr. Robinson,

42:25.443 --> 42:29.247
I am a man of almost
unlimited means,

42:29.280 --> 42:31.549
and I will use them
to keep you in court

42:31.583 --> 42:34.085
the rest of your natural life.

42:34.119 --> 42:36.554
Now, you seem like a nice kid.

42:36.588 --> 42:39.758
I would hate to see you broke,
on the street,

42:39.791 --> 42:44.029
buried in legal bills
you cannot afford to pay.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.697
Because the truth is,

42:45.731 --> 42:49.768
you can't win a lawsuit
that never ends.

42:49.801 --> 42:54.740
So, the next time
someone saves your life,

42:54.773 --> 42:57.575
just... say thank you.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.826
*

44:09.014 --> 44:10.982
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:13.084 --> 44:14.853
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:14.886 --> 44:17.422
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.259
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.964
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:25.997 --> 44:29.534
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *

44:29.567 --> 44:33.138
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:33.171 --> 44:34.172
MAN: Touchdown!

44:34.205 --> 44:37.743
* Reach out *

44:37.776 --> 44:41.379
* Make this right here
right now *

44:41.412 --> 44:44.349
* Stand up *

44:45.216 --> 44:46.985
* Here right now *

44:47.018 --> 44:48.787
That sounds like fun.
