[Screaming]

00:04.923 --> 00:06.490
Oh, my God.
You shot him!

00:06.524 --> 00:07.691
It was an accident.
I didn't see him!

00:07.726 --> 00:08.993
Can I help you?

00:09.027 --> 00:11.395
I... heard about...
Mr. Rubio being killed.

00:11.429 --> 00:12.830
I'm so sorry.

00:12.864 --> 00:15.666
<i>In a sad twist,
one young fan attempted suicide</i>

00:15.700 --> 00:18.068
<i>outside
Rubio's Beverly Hills home.</i>

00:18.103 --> 00:21.105
I was thinking you might benefit
from a trip to sage creek.

00:21.139 --> 00:23.440
Sage creek?
That's a looney bin.

00:23.475 --> 00:24.908
Goodbye, my darling.

00:24.943 --> 00:27.144
How soon until we go in
and take off our clothes?

00:27.178 --> 00:29.613
We should wait until his car
leaves the driveway.

00:29.647 --> 00:32.716
I know Dahlia killed herself.
Why didn't you tell me?

00:32.750 --> 00:35.452
I never told you 'cause I
was worried I'd scare you off.

00:35.487 --> 00:36.754
No more secrets.

00:36.788 --> 00:39.023
So, your husband doesn't talk?

00:39.057 --> 00:40.457
I'm his daughter.

00:40.492 --> 00:42.092
Oh.

00:42.127 --> 00:44.228
No, I'm at a job interview,
to be a maid.

00:44.262 --> 00:46.397
Your resume's very impressive.

00:46.431 --> 00:47.698
Thank you.

00:47.732 --> 00:49.633
Why didn't you tell your mother
you were home?

00:49.667 --> 00:52.703
Didn't you know she convinced Remi
to go to the Congo without me?

00:52.737 --> 00:55.105
You should be in school,
making something of your life.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.473
You're trying to control me.

00:56.508 --> 00:59.443
Now, please, go back to your
life and let me have mine.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.879
What about your, uh,
your friend from the Congo?

01:01.913 --> 01:03.580
He's in the Congo.

01:03.615 --> 01:05.983
- How's he doing?
- Not well.

01:06.017 --> 01:08.052
And I'm starting
to get worried.

01:08.086 --> 01:09.253
Is everything okay?

01:09.287 --> 01:11.055
<i>We're sending Remi

01:11.089 --> 01:12.589

01:19.030 --> 01:21.198
Look, I'm supposed to
be cleaning.

01:21.232 --> 01:23.333
Then start with me.
I'm very dirty.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.502
[Chuckles]
I'd suggest a cold shower.

01:25.536 --> 01:27.337
Only if you take one with me.

01:27.371 --> 01:29.339
[Laughs]
Okay. I'll stop.

01:29.373 --> 01:30.907
You know, you can't blame a guy

01:30.942 --> 01:32.576
for wanting to make out
with his girlfriend.

01:34.579 --> 01:36.646
Uh-oh.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.149
Did I use the "g" word
too soon?

01:40.284 --> 01:42.786
No. It's nice.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.721
Most guys want
to keep it casual forever.

01:44.789 --> 01:46.256
Oh, no.

01:46.290 --> 01:50.494
I'm way past casual.
I'm... you know...

01:50.528 --> 01:51.995
Feeling stuff.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.164
So am I.
[Chuckles]

01:54.198 --> 01:57.534
Which is why I want you
to take a cold shower.

01:57.568 --> 02:00.604
I'm serious.
I'm crazy about you.

02:00.638 --> 02:01.972
[Doorbell rings]

02:02.006 --> 02:03.073
Well, good.

from my boyfriend.</i>

02:05.476 --> 02:06.643
Just so you know,

02:06.677 --> 02:10.045
you have made me the happiest
pool boy in the world.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.481
[Laughs]

02:13.317 --> 02:14.518
Mrs. Delatour?

02:14.552 --> 02:16.419
I need you to come with me now.

02:16.454 --> 02:17.420
What's wrong?

02:17.455 --> 02:19.789
- Remi's back.
- From Africa?

02:19.824 --> 02:21.258
He's very sick.

02:21.292 --> 02:23.226
They brought him home
in an ambulance.

02:23.261 --> 02:25.562
- He's not in a hospital?
- No.

02:25.596 --> 02:28.465
I want the best for Remi,
so I've hired top doctors

02:28.499 --> 02:30.700
and private nurses
to look after him.

02:30.735 --> 02:33.870
You know, his first words were,
"where's Valentina?

02:33.905 --> 02:35.605
I need her."

02:35.640 --> 02:36.806
He said that?

02:38.476 --> 02:43.213
Oh, don't be sad, darling.
He's getting better.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.215
And the best part of all...

02:45.249 --> 02:47.150
[Chuckles]

02:47.184 --> 02:48.952

You make me happy.

- I want to buy you something.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.

04:31.221 --> 04:33.489
I know, but I want to celebrate
our relationship.

much space in here.

who lives in Bel Air?

a kid staying here?

05:58.575 --> 05:59.742
Yeah. Why?

It's just,
I-I hate kids.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.746
- How can you hate kids?
- They spill stuff.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.648
That's no reason to hate them.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.150
Well, it is if you're a maid.

My nephew is not a child.
He's 17.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.121
Much better.
Teenagers are never messy.

06:12.156 --> 06:13.489
Well, I don't have a choice.

06:13.524 --> 06:15.324
He's been having
some emotional problems,

06:15.359 --> 06:16.926
and my sister
can't leave him alone.

06:16.994 --> 06:19.629
Emotional problems?
What does that mean?

06:19.663 --> 06:23.332

he tried to commit suicide.

- Uncle Spence?

for what happened in Africa.

07:14.284 --> 07:15.751
You don't have to do that.

07:15.786 --> 07:16.986
No, I do.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.323
I was selfish and insensitive.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.258
But now that I'm back...

07:24.361 --> 07:26.295
I really want us to get
back together, you know?

07:26.330 --> 07:29.932

07:39.076 --> 07:40.776
She's right, Remi.

07:40.811 --> 07:42.645
You know what the doctors said.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.081
All right.

Val?

07:51.355 --> 07:53.823
I love you.

Okay.

08:04.201 --> 08:06.269
"Okay"?

08:06.303 --> 08:07.937
When Remi says he loves you,

08:07.971 --> 08:10.373
you say, "I love you, too,"
not "okay."

08:10.407 --> 08:12.208
I don't know if I can say that.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.110
Is it the beard?

08:14.144 --> 08:16.279
Because I agree...
It's terrible.

08:16.313 --> 08:19.115
When the doctor sedates him,
we'll shave it off.

08:19.149 --> 08:20.850
It's not the beard.

08:20.884 --> 08:22.552
What, then?

08:23.620 --> 08:25.188
I'm seeing someone.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.024
Who?

08:28.058 --> 08:32.395
- Ethan, your pool boy.
- You're dating my pool boy?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.964
I still adore Remi.
I-I do.

08:34.998 --> 08:37.866

really understands me.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.135

08:40.169 --> 08:43.905
- Mrs. Delatour.
- Remi is sick.

08:43.941 --> 08:46.876
And hearing you've abandoned him
won't help him get better.

08:46.910 --> 08:48.477
I haven't abandoned him.

08:48.512 --> 08:50.313
Well, you can't have them both.

- Kim Rampton.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.580
My book editor.

09:24.615 --> 09:26.482
I told you
we were working today.

09:26.516 --> 09:28.150
Oh.

you can imagine. [Chuckles]

I can imagine quite a lot.

09:45.068 --> 09:47.603
We still have
a lot of work to do, so...

Uh... I guess not.

10:15.165 --> 10:17.166
So, how deeply should I cut?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.769
Well, if you lose
the first paragraph... right?

10:19.803 --> 10:23.172
And then pick it back up
on this page here...

10:23.206 --> 10:24.840
Right? See that?
And then you could...

10:24.875 --> 10:26.742
Hey, Kim, why don't you
pull that chair over here?

10:26.777 --> 10:28.778
Oh. [Chuckles]

10:28.812 --> 10:31.047
Tired of me
hovering over you, huh?

10:31.081 --> 10:32.348
[Chuckles]

10:32.416 --> 10:33.916
No, no.

10:33.950 --> 10:36.185
I just think
this would be more comfortable.

10:37.921 --> 10:40.856
For everybody.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.159
Okay...

10:48.056 --> 10:50.520
I am telling you, your editor
wants to have sex with you.

10:50.588 --> 10:53.215
You are now
officially laughable.

10:53.216 --> 10:54.993
I can see it in his eyes,
the way he touches you.

10:55.241 --> 10:56.741
Oh! Kim touches me
like a friend.

10:56.776 --> 10:58.209
Yeah, who's looking
for a benefit.

10:58.244 --> 11:00.545
First of all, Kim is
the consummate professional,

11:00.579 --> 11:03.014
and secondly,
I'm not even his type.

11:03.048 --> 11:05.617
He's married to a blue-eyed
blonde from Minnesota.

11:05.651 --> 11:08.019
Well, lots of men
love chocolate ice cream,

11:08.053 --> 11:10.221
but every now and then,
they crave vanilla.

11:10.256 --> 11:12.791
If you're going to
reduce me to a flavor,

11:12.825 --> 11:15.460
can you pick something
more interesting than vanilla?

11:15.494 --> 11:18.396
Trust me. Kim wants more from you
than scintillating prose. [Scoffs]

11:18.430 --> 11:21.566
Kim's agenda is meaningless
unless I'm interested.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.868
Are you suggesting
that's possible?

11:23.903 --> 11:26.771
And be careful how you answer.

11:26.806 --> 11:30.275
He makes me uncomfortable.
That should matter to you.

11:32.344 --> 11:33.645
Okay.

11:33.679 --> 11:36.347
Tell you what... I will invite
Kim for dinner tomorrow night.

11:36.382 --> 11:39.617
You will get to know him,
see that he's harmless.

11:39.652 --> 11:42.120
You might even become friends.
[Chuckles]

11:42.154 --> 11:43.621
Opal's off tomorrow night.

11:43.656 --> 11:44.789
Then I'll cook.

11:44.824 --> 11:46.791
I don't know
what I'll be serving,

11:46.826 --> 11:50.361
but you'll be eating crow.

11:54.433 --> 11:55.733
Carmen is a fantastic cook.

11:55.768 --> 11:58.002
While you're here, she'll
make you anything you want.

11:58.037 --> 11:59.404
That'd be great.

11:59.438 --> 12:01.139
Thank you very much.

12:01.173 --> 12:02.807
[Cellphone rings]

12:02.842 --> 12:05.543
Oh. I got to take this.
I'll be right back.

12:05.578 --> 12:07.045
[Cellphone beeps]

12:08.681 --> 12:09.848
So...

12:09.882 --> 12:13.051
I guess my uncle told you
about my suicide attempt.

12:13.085 --> 12:15.186
Why would you say that?

12:15.221 --> 12:19.123
We're having steak, and you
brought me a plastic knife.

12:19.158 --> 12:22.493
I just don't like doing dishes.

12:22.528 --> 12:23.995
It's okay.

12:24.029 --> 12:25.763
I don't mind that he told you.

12:28.267 --> 12:30.802
Then... can I ask you
a question?

12:30.836 --> 12:31.669
Sure.

12:33.772 --> 12:36.040
Why would you try to...

12:36.075 --> 12:39.444
- You know?
- I was just...

12:39.478 --> 12:42.981
Feeling bad...
About my life.

12:43.015 --> 12:45.516
Are you feeling better now?

12:45.551 --> 12:46.684
[Chuckles]

12:46.719 --> 12:48.686
Relax.
I'm not gonna kill myself.

12:48.721 --> 12:50.688
Oh, good.
The job is hard enough.

12:50.723 --> 12:52.891
I don't need to be opening doors
and finding bodies.

12:52.925 --> 12:54.192
[Laughs]

12:54.226 --> 12:56.060
I love that you made a joke!

12:56.095 --> 12:59.330
Most people just tiptoe around
me 'cause they're so worried.

12:59.365 --> 13:03.668
Well, I'm not worried.
Not anymore.

13:04.937 --> 13:06.704
Does that mean
I can have a real knife?

13:06.739 --> 13:09.240
[Chuckles] No.

13:09.275 --> 13:11.175
[Laughs]

13:15.214 --> 13:17.548
I'm running to the store.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

13:17.583 --> 13:18.532
Okay.

13:18.533 --> 13:21.079
And just so you know, Miguel is
taking a nap in his room.

13:21.114 --> 13:22.474
Lord.

13:22.508 --> 13:25.176
You are not asking me
to babysit, are you?

13:25.211 --> 13:27.579
Well, since he's asleep,
I didn't think you'd...

13:29.248 --> 13:31.983
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

13:40.660 --> 13:42.694
[Whirring]

13:50.503 --> 13:51.569
Oh!

13:52.438 --> 13:54.205
Ohh!

13:54.240 --> 13:56.207
[Gasps]

13:59.378 --> 14:02.180
Now, what did I say about playing
in the house, little boy?

14:05.151 --> 14:06.651
You don't remember?

14:07.787 --> 14:09.854
Well.

14:09.889 --> 14:12.123
I'm going to see to it
that you do.

14:16.529 --> 14:18.163
[Door opens]

14:20.866 --> 14:22.067
[Door closes]

14:22.101 --> 14:25.036
- Remi's asleep.
- I'm not here to see him.

14:25.071 --> 14:26.905
Oh.

14:26.939 --> 14:30.975
I need some advice.

14:31.010 --> 14:36.181
But I can't talk to the person
I usually go to because...

14:36.215 --> 14:38.349
I'm supposed to be mad at her.

14:40.119 --> 14:43.221
Does that mean
you've forgiven me?

14:45.591 --> 14:47.592
I'm so sorry
for being such a brat.

14:48.994 --> 14:51.930
When I heard about you and papi,
I should have called.

14:51.964 --> 14:54.866
It's okay. You're here now,
and that is all I care about.

14:54.900 --> 14:58.136
Now, tell me, how can I help?

14:58.170 --> 15:00.505
Well...
[Sighs]

15:00.539 --> 15:03.308
I've been seeing Ethan
for the last month.

15:03.342 --> 15:04.809
That's what I heard.

15:04.844 --> 15:08.113
- And it's been great.
- But Remi's back.

15:08.147 --> 15:09.581
And saying all the things

15:09.615 --> 15:11.716
I wanted him to say
six months ago.

15:12.952 --> 15:15.987
Oh, mami, I love Remi.

15:16.710 --> 15:20.158
- But he broke my heart.
- Yes, he did.

15:20.192 --> 15:24.262
And Ethan is exciting,
and he makes me laugh,

15:24.296 --> 15:26.598
but how well
do I really know him?

15:26.632 --> 15:29.968
- He could hurt me, too.
- Well, he sure could.

15:30.002 --> 15:31.265
[Chuckles lightly]

15:31.266 --> 15:35.233
You totally have my permission
to tell me what to do.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.779
Honey, this is one decision
I can't make for you.

15:38.814 --> 15:41.415
Come on.
You live to give me advice.

15:41.450 --> 15:43.250
[Breathes deeply]

15:43.285 --> 15:46.253
All right. Here goes.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.991
Eat something.
You're too thin.

15:51.026 --> 15:54.295
You're really not gonna
tell me what to do?

15:54.329 --> 15:56.630
Nope.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.109
Your statue's almost finished.

16:08.143 --> 16:11.712
Yeah. It might end up being
the best thing I've ever done.

16:11.746 --> 16:13.647
[Chuckles] By the way...

16:13.682 --> 16:16.283
Miguel got up from his nap
five minutes after you left.

16:16.318 --> 16:18.185
I hope he wasn't any trouble.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.221
Well, he was
playing with that car again...

16:20.255 --> 16:22.690
Came out of nowhere,
knocked me over.

16:22.724 --> 16:24.058
So I spanked him.

16:26.294 --> 16:27.895
You did what?

16:27.929 --> 16:30.297
It was just
a little swat on his bottom.

16:30.332 --> 16:32.366
I put the fear of Lucinda
into him...

16:32.400 --> 16:34.268
Been a perfect angel
ever since.

16:39.941 --> 16:41.809
Are you okay?

16:41.843 --> 16:43.878
Yeah.

16:43.912 --> 16:45.813
[Smooches]

16:47.315 --> 16:48.949
[Exhales deeply]

16:54.156 --> 16:56.257
You do not hit my son.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.259
He was zooming that car
through the house,

16:58.293 --> 16:59.660
bent on destruction.

16:59.694 --> 17:02.730
- What was I supposed to do?
- Talk to him.

17:02.764 --> 17:05.499
Tell him if he's good,
you'll give him a cookie.

17:05.534 --> 17:08.269
I do not negotiate
with terrorists.

17:08.303 --> 17:12.673
Miguel is my son,
and I don't believe in violence.

17:12.707 --> 17:15.376
You act like I was beating
on the boy. It was nothing.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.710
Here... let me
show you what I did.

17:16.744 --> 17:17.845
[Gasps] Don't touch me!

17:17.878 --> 17:19.146
Why are you getting so upset?

17:19.181 --> 17:21.048
It was just a little
old-fashioned discipline.

17:21.082 --> 17:24.617
If you want to spank children,
get some of your own!

17:26.054 --> 17:29.523
Fine. I will
never touch Miguel again.

17:33.128 --> 17:35.462
But just so you know,

17:35.497 --> 17:38.599
that was
a very cruel thing to say.

17:49.306 --> 17:51.244
She spanked Miguel?

17:51.327 --> 17:52.794
Can you believe it?

17:52.829 --> 17:54.329
- I am shocked.
- I know.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.664
So, what did he do?

17:57.099 --> 17:59.134
Your "perfect child"
must have done something wrong.

17:59.168 --> 18:01.603
- What was it?
- What does it matter?

18:01.637 --> 18:03.605
Miss Lucinda
did violence on him.

18:03.639 --> 18:04.773
She spanked him.

18:04.807 --> 18:06.608
That's not even close
to violence.

18:06.642 --> 18:08.109
And stop eating my fries.

18:08.144 --> 18:10.078
That felt close to violence.

18:10.112 --> 18:13.114
The point is,
society has changed.

18:13.149 --> 18:14.883
Nobody really spanks anymore.

18:14.917 --> 18:18.553
- I let a guy spank me once.
- We're not talking about sex.

18:18.588 --> 18:20.522
Why not?
It would be more fun.

18:20.556 --> 18:22.390
The problem with spanking

18:22.425 --> 18:24.759
is that it can
very easily turn into abuse.

18:24.794 --> 18:26.027
Whoa!

18:26.062 --> 18:28.096
I spanked Valentina
when she was little.

18:28.130 --> 18:31.433
- Do you feel I'm abusive?
- You are to me.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.468
I don't mean to criticize
your parenting skills.

18:33.502 --> 18:35.237
It's just that
when my son would misbehave,

18:35.271 --> 18:36.638
I would talk to him.

18:36.672 --> 18:38.473
Didn't he end up in jail?

18:38.507 --> 18:41.142
[Chuckling] He was framed!

18:41.177 --> 18:44.145
I also dated this guy who liked
me to twist his nipples.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.314
Okay, either
follow the conversation

18:46.349 --> 18:48.049
or sit over there.

18:48.117 --> 18:50.852
So, what do I do
about miss Lucinda?

18:50.887 --> 18:53.455
You made your feelings known.
I think it's over.

18:53.489 --> 18:55.657
Until the next time
Miguel is naughty.

18:55.691 --> 18:57.792
You think
she'd spank him again?

18:57.827 --> 18:59.694
No.
She'll just fire you.

18:59.729 --> 19:00.862
It's her house.

19:00.897 --> 19:03.331
She doesn't have to put up
with kids who misbehave.

19:03.366 --> 19:06.067
I just wish I knew
what was up with her.

19:06.102 --> 19:08.370
Miss Lucinda
is angry about something,

19:08.404 --> 19:09.905
and it's not my son.

19:09.939 --> 19:11.473
[Carmen laughs]

19:11.507 --> 19:14.876
This other guy made me
wear heels and walk on his back.

19:16.846 --> 19:17.812
Ay!

19:23.252 --> 19:24.819
What are you doing in here?

19:24.854 --> 19:26.821
I'm moving in.

19:26.856 --> 19:29.658
- Didn't we discuss this?
- We did.

19:29.692 --> 19:31.860
You told me
to stay in the pool house.

19:31.894 --> 19:33.128
And yet, here you are,

19:33.162 --> 19:35.730
putting your boxer shorts
in my chiffonier.

19:35.765 --> 19:39.634
I think, in the long term,
you'll prefer this arrangement.

19:39.669 --> 19:42.938
Since when do you decide
what I'd prefer?

19:42.972 --> 19:44.673
You're an employee.

19:44.707 --> 19:47.342
An employee
who gives you orgasms.

19:47.376 --> 19:49.377
I'm not saying
you don't go the extra mile,

19:49.412 --> 19:52.380
but it doesn't entitle you
to be disrespectful.

19:52.448 --> 19:56.184
You were right when you said
I was a real man.

19:56.218 --> 19:59.554
And like all real men,
I have needs.

19:59.588 --> 20:03.425
If I waited for someone
to hand them to me, well...

20:03.459 --> 20:06.928
You wouldn't find me
so sexy and irresistible.

20:06.963 --> 20:10.065
I think you're overestimating
the power of your abs.

20:10.099 --> 20:13.335
This is what strength
looks like, Evelyn.

20:13.369 --> 20:16.338
You'll come to appreciate it
in time.

20:16.372 --> 20:17.872
[Gasps]

20:22.345 --> 20:25.246
So this is the price I pay
for passion?

20:25.281 --> 20:26.715
It is.

20:26.749 --> 20:29.017
But I'm worth it.

20:30.353 --> 20:31.586
[Chuckles lightly]

20:31.620 --> 20:32.754
Hey!

20:32.788 --> 20:33.855
Hey.

20:33.889 --> 20:35.256
When does my uncle get home?

20:35.291 --> 20:37.325
Oh, not till late.
He's shooting a commercial.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.693
What are you doing tonight?

20:38.728 --> 20:40.362
Are you kidding?
It's Friday night.

20:40.396 --> 20:41.896
I've got crazy plans.

20:41.931 --> 20:44.599
Gonna drink tea and write
in my therapy journal.

20:44.633 --> 20:47.035
Why don't you call some friends
and have them come over?

20:47.069 --> 20:48.403
My uncle wouldn't like that.

20:48.437 --> 20:51.072
No! He wants you
to have a good time.

20:51.107 --> 20:52.640
We both do.

20:52.675 --> 20:55.844
In that case,
I'll see who's around.

20:55.878 --> 20:57.245
Great.

20:57.279 --> 21:00.015
I'll go to the store and go
get you some chips and dip.

21:00.049 --> 21:01.950
Can I just say,

21:01.984 --> 21:07.856
you're... super-cool and fun
and really nice.

21:08.991 --> 21:10.492
Nothing about my looks?

21:12.561 --> 21:14.229
Okay.

21:15.431 --> 21:16.931
[Laughter]

21:16.966 --> 21:18.700
I'm so glad we did this.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.602
I knew
you two would hit it off.

21:20.636 --> 21:21.970
Are you kidding me?
I love this guy.

21:22.004 --> 21:23.138
He keeps
re-filling my glass.

21:23.172 --> 21:25.540
I like my guests
to feel relaxed.

21:25.574 --> 21:27.675
So, Marisol, we should start
talking about the book tour.

21:27.710 --> 21:29.010
Already?

21:29.045 --> 21:31.112
It's never too early
to start planning.

21:31.147 --> 21:33.281
Well, now, what exactly
is a book tour?

21:33.315 --> 21:35.483
Marisol and I would go
on the road for a few weeks,

21:35.518 --> 21:37.752
do some book signings,
interviews...

21:37.787 --> 21:39.220
You know, that sort of stuff.

21:39.255 --> 21:42.090
Yeah, just the two of you...
Out on the road.

21:43.526 --> 21:46.728
Hey, I haven't seen your wife
in months. How's Ingrid?

21:46.762 --> 21:48.430
Not exactly sure.

21:48.464 --> 21:51.266
We only speak through
attorneys these days.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.534
Attorneys?

21:52.568 --> 21:53.935
Yeah,
I didn't want to mention it,

21:53.969 --> 21:55.336
but I'm getting divorced.

21:55.371 --> 21:58.173
Oh. So you're
about to be single.

21:59.508 --> 22:02.243
Isn't there a chance
you two could work it out?

22:02.278 --> 22:04.345
You seem so devoted
to each other.

22:04.380 --> 22:06.681
Yeah,
I got caught red-handed.

22:06.715 --> 22:10.218
There was this gorgeous writer.
We were in Chicago together.

22:10.252 --> 22:12.053
- On a book tour?
- Good guess.

22:12.088 --> 22:14.355
And one thing
led to another and...

22:14.423 --> 22:15.723
[Chuckling]
You know how it goes.

22:15.758 --> 22:17.225
I do. [Chuckles]

22:17.259 --> 22:18.693
I really do.

22:18.727 --> 22:21.629
Kim, don't you think
you've had enough?

22:21.664 --> 22:23.398
No, I can still feel my liver.

22:23.432 --> 22:24.399
[Laughter]

22:24.433 --> 22:25.834
So, hey,
now that you're single,

22:25.868 --> 22:27.302
you'll probably want
to start dating, huh?

22:27.336 --> 22:28.937
Yeah, yeah.
If you know anyone...

22:28.971 --> 22:30.705
Oh! There's a woman
at my gym...

22:30.739 --> 22:32.841
Very sweet, blond.

22:32.875 --> 22:34.175
Yeah, I'm sick
of sweet blondes.

22:34.210 --> 22:35.410
I want a brunette, you know?

22:35.444 --> 22:37.445
Someone spicy and ethnic,
like you.

22:38.581 --> 22:40.048
Nick, you don't know
how lucky you are

22:40.082 --> 22:41.516
to have swept this one up.

22:41.550 --> 22:42.917
[Chuckles]

22:42.952 --> 22:45.120
And you don't know how lucky
you are to still have that hand.

22:46.288 --> 22:47.755
[Laughing]

22:49.058 --> 22:50.492
[Laughing]

22:52.862 --> 22:53.928
[Chuckles]

22:58.295 --> 23:00.263
[Dance music plays]

23:02.766 --> 23:05.508
No, no, no, no, no!

23:06.670 --> 23:08.638
[Indistinct conversations]

23:15.379 --> 23:17.814
Excuse me!
Where's Ty?

23:17.848 --> 23:18.681
Who?

23:24.455 --> 23:25.555
Ty?

23:25.589 --> 23:26.789
Hey.

23:26.857 --> 23:28.157
Did you get the chips?

23:28.192 --> 23:29.392
What is going on?

23:29.426 --> 23:30.960
I said you could have
a few friends over!

23:30.994 --> 23:32.562
I only texted four people.

23:32.596 --> 23:34.430
There's more
than four people here!

23:34.465 --> 23:37.033
Well, word got out,
and at first, I was angry,

23:37.067 --> 23:38.868
but...

23:38.902 --> 23:40.603
Now I just feel popular.

23:40.637 --> 23:42.171
Oh.
I'm glad you had fun.

23:42.206 --> 23:44.140
Because this party's over!

23:44.174 --> 23:45.475
Carmen...

23:45.509 --> 23:47.243
Please don't make me
send people home.

23:47.277 --> 23:49.779
- I'll be humiliated.
- Oh, you'll get over it.

23:49.813 --> 23:51.080
Maybe.

23:51.114 --> 23:52.710
Unless I get depressed again.

23:52.817 --> 23:55.351
And then...
Who knows what I'll do.

23:55.386 --> 23:58.221
You did not just threaten that.

23:58.255 --> 24:00.190
Look, I'm having fun.

24:00.224 --> 24:02.459
That's what you and uncle Spence
wanted, right?

24:12.203 --> 24:13.403
Hey, there.

24:13.437 --> 24:15.405
There's a party
going on next door,

24:15.439 --> 24:17.407
and it's so very loud.

24:17.441 --> 24:20.043
Do you have any policemen
close by?

24:22.813 --> 24:24.981
Hi.

24:25.015 --> 24:26.764
What are you doing here?

24:27.818 --> 24:30.253
You haven't returned my calls.

24:30.287 --> 24:32.422
I've had a lot on my mind.

24:34.091 --> 24:35.792
Look, I-I get it.

24:35.826 --> 24:37.727
You and Remi
were really serious,

24:37.761 --> 24:40.430
and you've only known me
for a few weeks.

24:40.464 --> 24:42.098
So if...

24:42.133 --> 24:45.001
If you want me
to back off, I will.

24:45.035 --> 24:46.970
Wow.

24:47.004 --> 24:48.938
Don't get me wrong.
I'm... I'm crazy-jealous.

24:48.973 --> 24:50.740
I mean, I want...
I want to kill the guy.

24:51.461 --> 24:56.036
I care about you, and...
I want you to be happy.

24:56.547 --> 25:00.350
That's very... noble.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.685
I may not be rich,

25:02.720 --> 25:06.128
and I haven't
saved any lives... lately...

25:06.991 --> 25:09.492
But I do have my moments.

25:09.527 --> 25:11.261
[Chuckles lightly]

25:14.899 --> 25:17.567
And this is one of them.

25:24.642 --> 25:27.977
Well, tonight was lovely.
But weren't you worried

25:28.012 --> 25:30.046
that one of your friends
might see us together?

25:30.080 --> 25:32.248
That's the advantage of having
an affair in Burbank...

25:32.283 --> 25:34.284
You never run into
anyone who matters.

25:38.255 --> 25:39.522
Whoa.

25:39.557 --> 25:41.624
Something wrong?

25:41.659 --> 25:45.161
I've never seen
a $900 dinner bill before.

25:45.196 --> 25:47.163
Oh, they always get you
on the wine.

25:47.198 --> 25:50.733
And this was
a 40-year-old Bordeaux, so...

25:50.768 --> 25:53.836
Well, you're very generous.

25:53.904 --> 25:55.838
Oh, no.

25:55.906 --> 25:59.042
I wouldn't dream
of emasculating you in that way.

25:59.076 --> 26:01.010
Huh?

26:01.045 --> 26:02.412
You're a real man.

26:02.446 --> 26:03.713
And it's my understanding

26:03.781 --> 26:05.915
they always insist
on paying the check.

26:05.950 --> 26:07.850
That's very clever, Evelyn.

26:07.885 --> 26:09.752
But I don't have
that kind of cash,

26:09.787 --> 26:11.654
and my credit card's
at its limit.

26:13.224 --> 26:16.559
How unfortunate for you.

26:16.594 --> 26:19.329
This is my old friend Angelo.

26:19.363 --> 26:22.065
He has been the maitre' here
for years.

26:22.099 --> 26:24.434
Before that, he had some sort
of career in New Jersey.

26:24.468 --> 26:26.002
What was it
you were involved in?

26:26.036 --> 26:28.905
- I can't talk about it.
- Fair enough.

26:28.939 --> 26:31.274
Anyway,
this is my friend, Tony,

26:31.308 --> 26:33.776
and if he doesn't pay the bill,
call the police...

26:33.811 --> 26:36.980
Or whatever it is you do
in these situations.

26:39.850 --> 26:43.953
- Just tell me what you want.
- I want you to behave.

26:44.673 --> 26:47.457
- Fine.
- Thank you.

26:50.261 --> 26:52.862
We may be having an affair,
but don't think for two seconds

26:52.896 --> 26:54.864
it gives you
some kind of power over me.

26:54.898 --> 26:56.866
So let me be clear...

26:56.900 --> 26:58.468
You can screw me,

26:58.502 --> 27:00.870
but you can't screw with me.

27:00.904 --> 27:04.574
I'll move my things back to
the pool house in the morning.

27:04.608 --> 27:07.377
As if there was ever any doubt.

27:11.749 --> 27:13.650
[Doorbell rings,
dance music plays]

27:13.684 --> 27:15.084
Excuse me, ma'am.

27:15.119 --> 27:17.420
One of your neighbors called
to complain about loud music.

27:17.454 --> 27:18.521
40 minutes ago.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.223
Thanks for rushing over.

27:24.428 --> 27:25.928
[Music stops]
[All groaning]

27:25.963 --> 27:28.564
Okay, listen up, people.
The police are here.

27:28.599 --> 27:30.433
And before you mouth off,
remember...

27:30.467 --> 27:33.136
They've got batons, and they're
not afraid to use them!

27:33.170 --> 27:35.138
That's not cool, ma'am.

27:35.172 --> 27:36.572
Hey.
Is there a problem?

27:36.607 --> 27:39.776
Yes. They want all your friends
out of the house now!

27:39.810 --> 27:42.111
But it's
not even 10:00 yet.

27:42.146 --> 27:44.447
Where you going?
Guys, wait!

27:44.481 --> 27:46.282
Oops.

27:46.317 --> 27:48.117
Son, what's in that cup?

27:48.152 --> 27:50.420
Um... milk?

What are you, 16?

27:53.223 --> 27:54.691
[Chuckles]

27:54.725 --> 27:56.926
Oh, I'm so flattered.
Actually, I'm 39.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.995
The missus
will back me up on that.

27:59.029 --> 28:01.431
He's 17. Why?

28:01.465 --> 28:03.800
Son, I'm gonna need you
to blow into this.

28:03.834 --> 28:06.135
No!
Nobody's blowing nothing.

28:06.170 --> 28:07.837
Ma'am, you need to step back.

28:07.871 --> 28:10.139
This is a violation of my civil rights.
I'm not doing that.

28:10.174 --> 28:11.941
Then you're gonna
have to come with us.

28:11.975 --> 28:13.643
Hey, you'll get me in trouble.
Put those away.

28:13.711 --> 28:14.610
Please turn around.

28:14.645 --> 28:17.480
Are you deaf?
I said stop!

28:19.817 --> 28:23.019
[Cell door clanging, slams]

28:23.053 --> 28:25.691
You couldn't just pretend
to be my wife?

28:33.820 --> 28:35.570
Uncle Spence is
gonna be so mad.

28:35.605 --> 28:36.772
You've got to talk to him.

28:36.806 --> 28:38.407
Y-you got to tell him
this wasn't my fault.

28:38.441 --> 28:40.075
You think
I'm gonna protect you?

28:40.109 --> 28:41.643
I could lose my job over this.

28:41.678 --> 28:44.279
And stop pacing!
You're making me nervous.

28:44.314 --> 28:45.881
You should be nice to me.

28:45.915 --> 28:47.482
This is a traumatic experience,

28:47.517 --> 28:49.384
and you know
how badly I handle stress.

28:49.619 --> 28:51.987
Oh, you're not getting
any more sympathy from me,

28:52.021 --> 28:53.588
you manipulative twerp!

28:53.623 --> 28:55.257
Okay, maybe I was milking it,

28:55.291 --> 28:56.758
but you don't know
some of the horrible stuff

28:56.793 --> 28:58.360
that's happened to me.

28:58.794 --> 29:01.129
You want to compete
in the misery Olympics?

29:01.163 --> 29:03.598
'Cause I can take you on
any day of the week!

29:03.632 --> 29:06.301
I'm sure it's rough going
through life as a hot chick.

[Sighs]

29:10.439 --> 29:12.440
Have you heard of
Alejandro Rubio?

29:14.243 --> 29:15.810
Sure.

29:15.845 --> 29:18.480
Did you hear
how he was murdered?

29:18.514 --> 29:20.315
Men broke into his home
and shot him

29:20.349 --> 29:21.950
while we were having a party.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.686
You were there?

29:27.823 --> 29:30.758
[Voice breaking]
He died in my arms.

29:30.793 --> 29:32.961
Oh, my God.

29:32.995 --> 29:34.963
So you can't talk to me
about pain

until you've seen
the light go out

29:36.999 --> 29:39.901
in the eyes
of someone you love.

29:41.437 --> 29:43.371
Carmen, I'm so sorry.

29:45.908 --> 29:47.275
Thank you.

29:49.812 --> 29:52.313
Your uncle just paid your bail.
Yours, too.

29:52.348 --> 29:53.815
Time to go.

29:53.849 --> 29:56.284
Look, I'm gonna tell
uncle Spence

29:56.318 --> 29:58.186
you had nothing
to do with the party.

29:58.220 --> 29:59.854
I appreciate that.

29:59.889 --> 30:01.856
And again, Carmen,
from the bottom of my heart,

30:01.891 --> 30:04.659
I am so sorry for everything
that you've gone through.

30:04.693 --> 30:06.394
It's okay, honey.

30:06.428 --> 30:08.196
It wasn't your fault.

30:20.576 --> 30:23.545
You're angry with me.

30:23.579 --> 30:26.614
- Yep.
- Why?

30:26.649 --> 30:28.616
Because I was right
about your friend?

30:28.651 --> 30:31.419
You can't judge him by tonight.
He was drunk.

30:31.453 --> 30:33.121
<i>In vino veritas.</i>

30:33.155 --> 30:34.923
There were no secrets revealed,

has a work crush.

one thing we learned...</i>

30:39.295 --> 30:41.162
You're not going
on that book tour.

30:41.196 --> 30:44.599
That decision is not up to you.

Do you want
to be alone with him?

with him?! Is that it?!

go through this again.

31:05.020 --> 31:07.589
Okay? The uncertainty,
the paranoia, the...

What do you mean "again"?

31:15.164 --> 31:18.032
- Oh, Nick.
- I should have told you.

31:18.067 --> 31:19.534
I just...

31:21.236 --> 31:24.005
I don't like
discussing my failures.

31:27.676 --> 31:29.510
Listen to me.

31:31.180 --> 31:34.616
I am not Dahlia.

31:34.650 --> 31:37.752
I will never be unfaithful
to you.

I'm not myself.

I think so.

32:22.965 --> 32:24.198
[Exhales deeply]

32:24.233 --> 32:25.700
Wow. [Chuckles]

32:25.734 --> 32:27.035
I'm so sorry.

32:27.069 --> 32:28.836
I didn't want to tell you
while you're sick, but...

32:28.871 --> 32:32.273
No, I'm glad you did.
I'd rather know the truth.

32:34.276 --> 32:36.244
Does he treat you well?

32:38.280 --> 32:39.714
Ethan is great.

32:39.748 --> 32:43.678
Good.
You deserve the best.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.721
Well...

32:46.755 --> 32:49.424
I should go
before your mother finds me.

32:51.326 --> 32:54.128
If she gives you any trouble,
just send her my way.

33:01.203 --> 33:02.737
Just so you know...

33:04.006 --> 33:06.541
I still love you.

33:08.510 --> 33:11.145
Honestly, Val...

33:11.180 --> 33:13.681
That kind of makes it worse.

33:28.530 --> 33:31.265
<i>No, pepito!</i>

33:31.300 --> 33:33.167
<i>No corres en la casa!</i>

33:33.202 --> 33:34.335
<i>Si, mami.</i>

33:34.369 --> 33:36.404
Good boy.

33:42.478 --> 33:44.245
Ohh!

33:44.313 --> 33:45.947
[Gasps]

33:45.981 --> 33:47.715
Oh, no.

33:48.984 --> 33:51.385
[Gasps] Oh, my God!

33:51.420 --> 33:54.388
Miss Lucinda!
I'm so sorry!

33:54.423 --> 33:56.624
Oh! It's ruined!

33:56.658 --> 33:59.861
No, maybe... we could
glue it back together.

33:59.895 --> 34:01.329
How did this happen?!

34:01.363 --> 34:03.431
Well,
I-I was sweeping,

34:03.465 --> 34:05.466
and Miguel was running
through the house and...

34:05.534 --> 34:07.001
Of course... Miguel!

34:07.035 --> 34:08.335
Wait! I didn't mean...

34:08.370 --> 34:10.138
You are so lucky
that this was your son,

34:10.172 --> 34:11.873
'cause if you had
broken my sculpture,

34:11.907 --> 34:13.775
I would have fired your ass.

34:15.476 --> 34:17.311
Miguel!

34:18.880 --> 34:19.847
<i>Que?</i>

34:19.882 --> 34:21.014
Come here, little boy.

34:21.049 --> 34:23.484
No, he's my son.
I will punish him.

34:23.518 --> 34:26.387
I know you will.
And you will do it now.

34:27.723 --> 34:28.723
<i>Que?</i>

34:28.757 --> 34:30.690
You are living in my house.

34:30.726 --> 34:34.462
I need to know that you take
your role as a parent seriously.

34:34.496 --> 34:36.496
Now discipline
the hell out of him.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.219

34:44.487 --> 34:45.648
_

34:45.683 --> 34:48.418

34:48.454 --> 34:51.344

34:51.799 --> 34:53.155

34:54.830 --> 34:56.418

34:56.552 --> 34:58.019

34:58.462 --> 35:01.629

35:14.102 --> 35:15.736
[Whimpering]

35:17.673 --> 35:18.806
[Sighs]

35:18.841 --> 35:20.308
Wow.

35:20.342 --> 35:22.076
You were really tough on him.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.912
How else will he learn?

35:31.895 --> 35:34.563
[Spray can hisses]

35:39.669 --> 35:42.838
[Spray can hisses]

35:55.388 --> 35:58.719
Miss Lucinda?
Are you okay?

36:00.059 --> 36:02.661
I've seen better days.

36:02.695 --> 36:04.696
What's wrong?

36:04.731 --> 36:09.001
Did Miguel do something
to upset you again?

36:11.037 --> 36:15.841
I was 6 the last
time daddy spanked me.

36:15.875 --> 36:20.512
He told me if I was good,
there'd be no need to punish me.

36:20.547 --> 36:25.083
So I began doing all my chores,
stopped sassing back.

36:25.118 --> 36:28.554
I was the perfect daughter.

36:28.588 --> 36:33.325
- Until I turned 15.
- What happened then?

36:34.761 --> 36:36.778
I fell in love with a boy.

36:37.564 --> 36:42.138
Got pregnant.
Daddy was so angry.

36:42.502 --> 36:45.304
He wouldn't let me
keep the baby.

36:45.338 --> 36:46.639
No.

36:46.673 --> 36:48.774
Oh, yes.
[Sniffles]

36:48.808 --> 36:52.144
He made me give up
my little girl for adoption.

36:52.178 --> 36:54.813
And all these years,
I told myself

36:54.848 --> 36:58.984
maybe he didn't have room
in his heart for another child.

36:59.019 --> 37:03.656
But now I see him
with your son,

37:03.690 --> 37:05.658
and I know it's not true.

37:05.692 --> 37:08.494
I am so sorry.

37:09.126 --> 37:12.568
I spend my days molding clay,

37:12.999 --> 37:15.901
trying to create
something beautiful.

37:15.936 --> 37:17.970
But what I would have given

37:18.004 --> 37:20.839
for a chance
to mold a little life.

37:23.810 --> 37:25.408
Anyway...

37:26.613 --> 37:28.847
To answer your question,

37:28.882 --> 37:33.452
your son is not the one
I have a problem with.

38:06.853 --> 38:08.087
Hey.

38:08.121 --> 38:11.423
- Remi!
- You're out of bed.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.559
It's okay.
I'm feeling better.

38:13.593 --> 38:15.060
And looking better, too.

38:15.095 --> 38:17.730
I don't know if I told you,
but I hated the beard.

38:17.764 --> 38:18.931
You told me.

38:18.965 --> 38:21.834
Well, it's good to see you
looking like your old self.

38:21.868 --> 38:25.137
- Anything I can get you?
- How about Valentina?

38:26.306 --> 38:27.439
What?

38:27.474 --> 38:29.441
She told me about Ethan.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.010
I specifically told her...

38:31.044 --> 38:33.545
Mom, relax.
I had to find out sometime.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.547
I'm so sorry.

38:35.582 --> 38:37.616
I know how upset
you must be.

38:37.650 --> 38:39.785
I just know that I-if
she'd give me another chance,

38:39.819 --> 38:41.286
I can make her happy.

38:41.321 --> 38:43.422
If you would
just maybe talk to her...

38:43.456 --> 38:45.524
You can talk to Valentina
all you want,

38:45.558 --> 38:49.495
but I no longer stick my nose
where it doesn't belong.

38:51.231 --> 38:54.133
Zoila, when I was
lying in that tent in Africa,

38:54.167 --> 38:57.403
thinking I was gonna die,
she is what kept me going.

38:57.437 --> 39:00.939
I'm so sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

39:08.081 --> 39:10.215
You still love Valentina,

39:10.250 --> 39:12.651
even though she's taken up
with someone else?

39:12.685 --> 39:14.887
She's my life, mom.

39:14.921 --> 39:16.955
I know
we're meant to be together.

39:18.992 --> 39:21.493
Then I will get her back
for you.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.662
That is a promise.

39:31.471 --> 39:32.571
Patio's done.

39:32.605 --> 39:35.107
Well, we still got
a ways to go in here.

39:35.141 --> 39:37.409
Be right back.
I'm gonna take this out.

39:37.444 --> 39:40.479
- I got it.
- Thanks.

39:40.513 --> 39:42.848
Look, I know I got mad at you
about the party,

39:42.882 --> 39:45.017
but I'm thrilled
you're getting back to normal.

39:45.051 --> 39:48.253
Yeah. I'm in a better place,
thanks to you.

39:48.288 --> 39:49.621
And Carmen.

39:55.562 --> 39:56.862
Hey.

39:58.498 --> 40:02.367
Your uncle's got
a real nice house.

40:02.402 --> 40:03.835
What are you doing here?

40:05.642 --> 40:07.840
Came to check on you.

40:07.874 --> 40:10.442
Heard you had some...
Some trouble with the cops?

40:10.477 --> 40:13.479
Relax. I didn't...
I didn't tell them anything.

40:14.714 --> 40:16.415
How are you feeling?

40:18.017 --> 40:20.085
I don't know.
I still have nightmares.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.621
Well, it was an accident.

40:22.655 --> 40:26.425
Carter killed Alejandro.

40:26.459 --> 40:29.761
That might not be
how the rest of us remember it.

40:30.864 --> 40:33.098
What's that
supposed to mean?

40:33.133 --> 40:37.603
It'll always be
our word against yours.

40:38.838 --> 40:42.341
You son of a bitch.
You'd throw me under the bus?

40:43.343 --> 40:47.613
Just keep your mouth shut,
and we won't have to.
