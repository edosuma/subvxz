WEBVTT

00:00.208 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.208
a friend of mine

00:07.958 --> 00:11.375
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.500
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.500 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.500 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.458
and there's nobody home

00:34.458 --> 00:37.875
to count on a friend

00:37.875 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.750 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.875
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:02.125 --> 01:05.583
Gopher: Eh, what's
this all about?

01:05.583 --> 01:08.375
Piglet: I hope
it's nothing b-b-bad.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.000
Tigger: Look,
I can touch my nose.

01:11.208 --> 01:14.375
Quiet! Quiet down,
everyone.

01:14.375 --> 01:18.458
I called this meeting
for a very serious reason.

01:18.458 --> 01:21.583
It's that time
of year again.

01:21.583 --> 01:26.125
Oh, no. Not that time
of year already.

01:26.125 --> 01:29.750
Uh, exactly what
that time of year is it?

01:29.750 --> 01:32.000
Valentine's Day.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.875
We must avoid
the terrible fiasco

01:36.875 --> 01:38.500
that took place last year.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.875
Absotively
posilutely, long ears.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.458
But just one thing:

01:42.458 --> 01:44.625
what terrible fiasco
are we talking about?

01:44.625 --> 01:48.291
Tigger, allow me
to refresh your memory.

01:49.708 --> 01:51.833
Too many cards
were given last year.

01:51.833 --> 01:56.333
10 zillion valentines is more
than any one animal can use.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.958
Oh, my. They were all about,
weren't they?

01:58.958 --> 02:03.166
That's right.
They stopped up
my tunnel.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.166
Yeah. My house
was a terrible mess.

02:08.166 --> 02:10.083
Why, I couldn't even find it.

02:10.083 --> 02:13.000
Uh, has anybody
seen it lately?

02:13.000 --> 02:17.708
And most of the blame can be
placed on just one of us:

02:17.708 --> 02:20.208
a certain bear who
shall remain nameless

02:20.208 --> 02:22.166
but whose initials
are Winnie the Pooh.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.416
Hmm. That sounds familiar,

02:26.416 --> 02:29.083
but I can't quite
place the face.

02:29.083 --> 02:32.333
Whenever anyone gave him
one valentine,

02:32.333 --> 02:34.333
he responded with three.

02:34.333 --> 02:37.291
Heh. I had 40 bushels.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.416
I received 200,000 at least.

02:40.416 --> 02:44.500
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
an even quadzillion and 1.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.000
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

02:46.000 --> 02:48.500
Uh, I wonder how many that is.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.458
Well, now
that that's solved,

02:50.458 --> 02:53.291
shouldn't we get down
to important matters

02:53.291 --> 02:55.083
like giving valentines?

02:55.083 --> 02:59.708
Pooh, you must learn
to control yourself.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.583
But I can't help it.

03:01.583 --> 03:04.250
I just like to show
how much I care.

03:04.250 --> 03:08.458
In fact, happy
Valentine's Day, Rabbit.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.708
It's hopeless.

03:10.708 --> 03:14.875
Pooh, I'm afraid there's
only one thing left to do.

03:14.875 --> 03:18.166
You're going to give me
a valentine?

03:18.166 --> 03:19.416
Oh, thank you.

03:19.416 --> 03:20.583
No!

03:20.583 --> 03:24.083
We must cancel
Valentine's Day.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.083
Really?

03:26.083 --> 03:27.750
- Oh, my.
- Golly.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.250
Cancel Valentine's Day?

03:32.250 --> 03:34.291
There's no other way.

03:34.291 --> 03:38.083
The situation calls
for drastic measures.

03:38.083 --> 03:41.625
We should follow the example
set by Eeyore last year.

03:41.625 --> 03:45.166
But, uh, Eeyore didn't send
any valentines last year.

03:45.166 --> 03:49.875
Exactly. That way, nobody's
feelings will be hurt.

03:49.875 --> 03:54.458
And nobody will be
buried by unwanted cards.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.458
I want everyone to promise

03:56.458 --> 04:01.166
that not even a teeny-tiny
valentine gift will be given.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.375
- Kanga: Oh, all right.
- Roo: Me, too.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.583
- Gopher: Certainly.
- Tigger: Indubitably.
- Pooh: Oh, bother.

04:05.583 --> 04:06.875
Rabbit: So it's official.

04:06.875 --> 04:10.750
Valentine's Day is cancelled.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.333
- Now who could that be?

04:18.750 --> 04:22.458
A valentine
gift for me?

04:22.458 --> 04:25.458
Oh, my. Someone
broke their promise.

04:25.458 --> 04:29.125
Hmm. I'm quite certain
it wasn't me.

04:29.125 --> 04:32.583
I would remember giving myself
a gift as wonderful as this.

04:32.583 --> 04:37.208
Unless, of course I did it
when I wasn't around.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.333
It must be from
my best friend Piglet.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.000
He really shouldn't have.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.125
But I'm glad he did.

04:46.125 --> 04:50.000
I must give him something
as wonderful in return.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.833
Perhaps a jar of honey.

04:52.833 --> 04:57.083
But I'd better not tell
anyone, including me.

04:57.083 --> 05:00.208
I've never been known
for keeping a secret.

05:05.583 --> 05:07.000
Uh, y-yes?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.083
Piglet, you promised
not to do it.

05:10.083 --> 05:14.375
I'm sorry, Pooh. I promise
not to do it again.

05:14.375 --> 05:17.083
Uh, what did I do?

05:17.083 --> 05:20.375
You gave me
a wonderful jar
of honey

05:20.375 --> 05:22.000
as a valentine gift.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.250
I did?

05:23.250 --> 05:25.750
And if you ever do
such a thing again,

05:25.750 --> 05:29.875
I shall have no choice
but to thank you again.

05:29.875 --> 05:32.500
Happy Valentine's Day,
Piglet.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.875
I'm sorry
it's only half full,

05:35.875 --> 05:38.458
but it was a long trip.

05:38.458 --> 05:42.250
Oh, thank you, Pooh,
but I can't keep it.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.458
Why not?

05:43.458 --> 05:46.000
Because I didn't
get you anything.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.750
--
my best friend.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.416
Oh, that's all right,
Piglet.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.875
Keep it anyway.

05:52.875 --> 05:56.000
Only please don't tell
anyone about it.

06:03.750 --> 06:08.208
Oh, my. If the honey wasn't
from my best friend Piglet,

06:08.208 --> 06:11.166
then from what best
friend was it from?

06:11.166 --> 06:13.583
I never remembered
Valentine's Day

06:13.583 --> 06:15.875
to be so confusing.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.958
I must find the real
valentine giver

06:18.958 --> 06:21.125
and give him a piece
of my mind.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.708
And a valentine.

06:22.708 --> 06:25.000
Oh, dear.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.125
Now I have to make
Pooh a valentine, too,

06:27.125 --> 06:29.958
or-- or he'll think
I'm ungrateful.

06:31.166 --> 06:33.958
I do hope Rabbit
doesn't find out.

06:33.958 --> 06:37.250
Oh, dear. Oh, d-d-dear.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.875
Mama, isn't that Pooh?

06:45.875 --> 06:49.750
Now, Roo, dear, it isn't
polite to bother someone

06:49.750 --> 06:52.291
when they're pretending
to be a mailbox.

06:52.291 --> 06:56.958
A mailbox
for secret valentines
only, if you please.

06:59.375 --> 07:03.291
Oh, bother. My disguise
doesn't seem to be working.

07:06.333 --> 07:10.000
Aw. I think the mailbox
is sad, Mama.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.875
Maybe a valentine
would cheer him up.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.000
But don't tell Rabbit.

07:17.458 --> 07:20.250
Think. Think. Think.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.958
I do hope Pooh likes the
valentine cake I made him.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.875
And I do hope no one sees me.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.958
- What was that?

07:29.958 --> 07:31.458
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

07:31.458 --> 07:34.166
Hiya, Piglet pal!
What's up?

07:34.166 --> 07:36.166
Uh...up?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.333
Yeah. You know. P-U: up.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.833
Oh, nothing.
Certainly not a cake.

07:43.833 --> 07:45.708
Oops. D-Did I say cake?

07:45.708 --> 07:47.583
I meant aren't we late?

07:47.583 --> 07:50.875
Yeah, uh, late? Late for what?

07:50.875 --> 07:53.458
Oh, we must be late
for something.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.375
Uh, breakfast?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.708
Oh, I had breakfast
already, Piglet.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.625
Well, you can never
have too many breakfastses,

08:00.625 --> 08:01.708
I always say.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.875
I say, how strange
for snow to fall

08:10.875 --> 08:12.375
on such a clear day,

08:12.375 --> 08:15.000
especially warm, sweet snow--

08:16.166 --> 08:18.250
with raspberry hearts.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.500
Oh, how nice. Piglet
sent me a valentine cake.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.250
Why,
I haven't been so moved

08:29.250 --> 08:31.583
since Aunt Lucille
tried to teach me to fly

08:31.583 --> 08:33.583
by kicking me out of the nest.

08:33.583 --> 08:37.583
Unfortunately, I was
still in my egg at the time.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.250
Ahem.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.958
I must reciprocate
Piglet's generous offering

08:41.958 --> 08:44.208
with a valentine of my own.

08:44.208 --> 08:46.208
Uh, secretly, of course.

08:46.208 --> 08:49.875
I wonder. What does one
get a very small animal?

08:49.875 --> 08:55.333
Ah, yes, I know:
a very small valentine.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.875
Yeah. Icy cream sundaes
and eggs sound good.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.958
But what I could really
use for breakfast is--

09:06.750 --> 09:07.875
Yipe!

09:07.875 --> 09:09.250
Oh, d-d-dear.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.875
Piglet?

09:10.875 --> 09:12.833
Piglet?

09:12.833 --> 09:15.333
Hmm. What's this?

09:15.333 --> 09:19.333
Ha ha ha! Buddy bird
got me a valentine cake.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.166
Well, I got to get old
feather duster something, too.

09:22.166 --> 09:25.291
But first I'd better
get rid of this evidence

09:25.291 --> 09:26.708
before Rabbit sees it.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.708
Back.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.375
Back.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.875
Oh, there. Finally.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.583
For me? A gift?

09:44.583 --> 09:46.458
Ooh, well, how nice.

09:47.708 --> 09:50.583
Oh, no. It's a valentine!

09:50.583 --> 09:52.458
Not again!

09:54.583 --> 09:59.750
No! No! No!

09:59.750 --> 10:01.958
Pooh Bear!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.875
I do hope Pooh likes
the valentine I got him.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.000
Oh, d-d-dear.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.458
Maybe I should have
given him candy instead.

10:11.458 --> 10:15.208
Yaah!

10:15.208 --> 10:18.750
And one for Pooh
and one for Piglet

10:18.750 --> 10:20.458
and-- Yaah!

10:20.458 --> 10:23.208
I'm not sending
any valentines.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.708
I'm, uh, heh heh,

10:24.708 --> 10:27.625
I'm mail ordering
for a ball pin carburetor.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.583
Honest. Heh heh heh heh.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.208
And I'm, uh, uh,

10:31.208 --> 10:33.416
catching up on my
correspondences.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.208
Lots of relatives,
you know.

10:35.208 --> 10:39.583
Oh, good. My new and improved
disguise is working.

10:39.583 --> 10:40.833
- Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Yipe!

10:40.833 --> 10:42.625
- Aah!
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.875
What are you guys doing?

10:45.208 --> 10:48.083
Both: We're not
sending valentines.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.625
- Nope, not us.
- We wouldn't think of it.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.625
Uh-uh. No way.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.291
Yeah, well,
it's a good thing.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.500
We promised Rabbit.

10:58.833 --> 11:00.250
Uh, oh, heh heh.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.708
I'm just mailing it
to myself.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.708
Kanga: Excuse us.

11:04.708 --> 11:05.708
- Yike!
- Yaah!

11:07.250 --> 11:08.875
It's a secret.

11:08.875 --> 11:12.583
Gee, Rabbit, didn't you
bring a valentine, too?

11:12.583 --> 11:15.416
And just what
is going on here?

11:16.708 --> 11:18.000
Oh, bother.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.083
Yaah!

11:22.083 --> 11:23.583
Oh, dear.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.708
What?

11:28.833 --> 11:31.833
Happy Valentine's Day,
Rabbit?

11:33.875 --> 11:37.458
Roo: And Tigger sent one
and Owl and Gopher and Pooh.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.291
Order!

11:42.291 --> 11:44.250
Ahem. Clearly,

11:44.250 --> 11:47.125
there's only one of us
of so very little brain

11:47.125 --> 11:49.125
that he'd start
this mess up again

11:49.125 --> 11:52.250
and break his
no valentines promise.

11:52.250 --> 11:56.083
Pooh, why did you do it?

11:56.083 --> 11:59.958
But I didn't, Rabbit.
Someone else broke it first,

11:59.958 --> 12:03.458
and I just broke it some more.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.333
Someone else?

12:06.333 --> 12:11.500
Then that someone else
has to be someone else
in this room.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.875
Yes! It was me!
I did it! I'm sorry!

12:14.875 --> 12:21.458
Aha! And why did you send
the valentine, Piglet?

12:21.458 --> 12:23.750
Well, you see, I, uh, uh--

12:23.750 --> 12:26.458
Heh heh,
actually, it wasn't me.

12:26.458 --> 12:29.125
Then why did you confess?

12:29.125 --> 12:32.125
I-- I'm, uh, not
very good under pressure?

12:32.125 --> 12:34.291
We must get to
the bottom of this.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.958
Say, who's the guilty
party around here?

12:36.958 --> 12:38.750
Who broke
the promise, Mama?

12:38.750 --> 12:41.000
- Speak up, whoever you are.
- Why, I don't know, dear.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.875
Order. Order!

12:42.875 --> 12:44.458
Order!

12:44.458 --> 12:45.875
Perhaps it was someone

12:45.875 --> 12:48.291
who didn't know
about our promise.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.000
Someone like...

12:50.000 --> 12:51.708
Christopher Robin.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.166
Pooh, you're right.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.958
He didn't know.

12:57.958 --> 13:00.333
It must have
been him.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.500
Well, if Christopher Robin's
sending cards,

13:02.500 --> 13:04.750
we're going to have to
send him one, too,

13:04.750 --> 13:07.000
uh, in self-defense.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
- Gopher: We should.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I thought I saw a card
around here somewhere.

13:13.166 --> 13:15.500
No. No!

13:16.708 --> 13:18.458
Oh, my. This won't do.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.375
This card's
for Groundhog's Day.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.875
Where did this
come from?

13:22.875 --> 13:26.375
Say, these are all
used valentines.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.083
We got to have a new one
for Christopher Robin.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.500
It's an extra I had.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.875
It's terrifical,
buddy bear! Ha ha!

13:36.875 --> 13:40.125
Uh, but it's kind of
on the scrawny side.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.458
We need a valentine
so gigantical,

13:42.458 --> 13:45.708
it'll hold all our friendship
and then some.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.208
Maybe we could
act out Pooh's card.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.000
Then it would be like
a real-live valentine

13:51.000 --> 13:52.750
with all of us in it.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.708
Piglet,
that's a wonderful idea.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.416
Why didn't I think of it?

13:59.416 --> 14:03.125
- What a lovely idea.
- A living valentine.

14:03.125 --> 14:06.750
A project like this
will require organization,

14:06.750 --> 14:09.500
skilled planning,
and leadership.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.875
Obviously a job for--

14:12.875 --> 14:14.458
Ahem. Action.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.250
I said action.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.291
Uh, heh heh,

14:22.291 --> 14:25.333
happy Valentine's Day,
Mrs. Kanga, ma'am.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.583
Well, thank you, Tigger, dear.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.583
Tigger, what are you doing?

14:31.583 --> 14:33.416
That isn't romance.

14:33.416 --> 14:35.416
Well, sure it is, long ears.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.625
You always bounce
the one you love.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.250
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

14:39.250 --> 14:41.625
Uh, here. Use these.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.083
Mm. Oh, say, not bad.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.583
Could use a little
mustard, though.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.875
Uh, have a taste,
Mrs. Kanga.

14:50.875 --> 14:54.333
No, no, no.
You give them
to her to hold.

14:54.333 --> 14:57.000
And then you give her
a big kiss.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.166
A kiss?

14:59.166 --> 15:01.958
Oh, no. No.
Anything but that.

15:01.958 --> 15:05.000
Anything but-- Yecch. Kiss.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.250
Uh, shouldn't I just
shake her pouch or something?

15:08.250 --> 15:11.958
No. You must kiss her.

15:11.958 --> 15:16.291
You want to be in Christopher
Robin's valentine, don't you?

15:16.291 --> 15:19.958
Well...okay.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.833
Bleah. That's it.

15:23.833 --> 15:27.000
You're fired, Tigger, fired.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.625
You obviously don't
have what it takes.

15:29.625 --> 15:33.375
This part calls for
someone with talent,

15:33.375 --> 15:35.500
someone like...

15:42.458 --> 15:43.958
Here you are.

15:43.958 --> 15:47.875
For me? Why,
thank you, Rabbit.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.208
I'm touched.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.250
That's not a gift, Pooh.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.958
They're for the show.

15:52.958 --> 15:55.875
Yes. But it's
a nice thought anyway.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.416
Since when

15:58.416 --> 16:00.583
does a valentine
need gunpowder?

16:00.583 --> 16:03.625
Since I took over
the special defects.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.375
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

16:05.375 --> 16:09.833
And then Cupid flies in and--

16:09.833 --> 16:11.708
Where's Cupid?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.083
I'm Cupid, bringer of love.
I'm Cupid, bringer of love.

16:17.083 --> 16:20.708
Uh, Rabbit, wouldn't a very
small animal such as myself

16:20.708 --> 16:23.291
be better playing
a very small part?

16:23.291 --> 16:27.583
Nonsense, Piglet.
You were born to play Cupid.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.375
Besides, you're just
the right color for it.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.083
Now let's see
your arrow shooting.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.083
Yaah!

16:36.083 --> 16:37.875
Oh, magnificent.

16:37.875 --> 16:40.708
He flies like
the very wind itself.

16:45.375 --> 16:49.000
No, no.
You must feel the music.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.291
Now once more, with feeling.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.875
Well, I felt it.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.750
Ten minutes to show time.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.458
Make-up!

17:11.458 --> 17:12.708
Make-up!

17:13.833 --> 17:15.500
- It's--
- Make-up!

17:18.875 --> 17:20.416
Excuse me. Pardon us.

17:20.416 --> 17:22.250
Excuse us. Pardon us.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.083
What's
going on, Rabbit?

17:25.083 --> 17:27.708
Here we are: 13D.

17:29.583 --> 17:33.250
Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen,

17:33.250 --> 17:35.833
Rabbit presents
a Rabbit production

17:35.833 --> 17:40.125
ofRabbit's Valentine
to Christopher Robin.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.333
To me?

17:43.958 --> 17:46.583
Directed by Rabbit,
written by Rabbit,

17:46.583 --> 17:48.625
from an original idea
by Rabbit,

17:48.625 --> 17:50.750
based on
a notion by Rabbit,

17:50.750 --> 17:52.333
starring, uh, the others.

17:56.166 --> 17:59.708
Oh, yes. Original music
composed by Rabbit, too.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.375
Cupid.

18:06.375 --> 18:07.833
That's your cue.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.166
Yaah!

18:17.708 --> 18:20.000
I, uh-- I...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.708
Am Cupid,
bringer of love.

18:22.708 --> 18:25.875
I-- I, uh...I...

18:25.875 --> 18:28.458
I am Cupid, bringer of--

18:28.458 --> 18:29.500
Oh, my.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.125
I am Cupid!

18:32.125 --> 18:34.250
That was not in the script.

18:49.416 --> 18:52.458
Where does the script say
orchestra blows away?

18:52.458 --> 18:53.500
Where?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.583
--

18:56.583 --> 18:59.458
I give you these--

19:00.583 --> 19:01.625
Oh, bother.

19:01.625 --> 19:04.500
Oh, isn't that sweet?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.083
Thank you, dear.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.833
I must not have read
the script closely

19:08.833 --> 19:12.458
because I don't
remember this part.

19:14.625 --> 19:17.458
It is Valentine's Day,
Kanga,

19:17.458 --> 19:19.583
and in the air there is--

19:19.583 --> 19:21.708
I am Cupid!

19:21.708 --> 19:27.708
A piglet and a gopher
and a roo.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.500
Not to mention an owl.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.875
Tigger, the curtain.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.750
Uh, time for the big finish?

19:34.750 --> 19:36.708
You got it, Bunny boy.

19:39.416 --> 19:41.750
I am Cupid!

19:41.750 --> 19:43.416
No, no, no. Tigger!

19:43.416 --> 19:46.875
One big finish coming up!

19:46.875 --> 19:47.958
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

19:47.958 --> 19:50.291
Pooh: What do we do
now, Rabbit?

19:50.291 --> 19:53.708
I am Cupid!

19:57.583 --> 19:59.000
My show!

19:59.000 --> 20:00.750
It was an absolute--

20:00.750 --> 20:03.958
Absolute success.

20:03.958 --> 20:06.583
The best comedy
I've ever seen.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.750
Uh, comedy?

20:08.750 --> 20:11.416
But it wasn't a--
a comedy?

20:11.416 --> 20:12.833
Yeah, oh, of course.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.458
It was a comic valentine.

20:15.458 --> 20:18.458
I'm very glad you liked it,
Christopher Robin.

20:18.458 --> 20:22.291
Liked it?
It was the greatest
Valentine's ever.

20:22.291 --> 20:25.583
These ones I got you
aren't as nice.

20:25.583 --> 20:26.958
Hey, thanks.

20:26.958 --> 20:29.458
Oh, thank you,
Christopher Robin.

20:29.458 --> 20:31.583
Oh, I say, thank you.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.250
- Why, thank you, dear.
- Gopher: Thanks.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.750
Thanks, Christopher Robin.

20:35.750 --> 20:38.083
Well, if you think
this was good,

20:38.083 --> 20:41.125
just wait until you see
next year's show.

20:41.125 --> 20:47.125
I am Cupid, bringer of love.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.958
Uh, Pooh,
something's bothering me.

20:56.958 --> 21:00.458
If Christopher Robin
gave you a card this morning,

21:00.458 --> 21:02.708
why did he give you
another one just now?

21:02.708 --> 21:07.291
I suppose, Piglet...
he forgot.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.500
Although it's usually me
who does the forgetting.

21:10.500 --> 21:15.208
Hello, Pooh. How'd you like
the valentine I left you?

21:15.208 --> 21:18.708
Not that I expect
any ballyhoo, mind you.

21:18.708 --> 21:20.750
You mean it was you

21:20.750 --> 21:23.166
who left Pooh the jar
of honey this morning?

21:23.166 --> 21:24.958
Yep.

21:24.958 --> 21:28.625
Felt bad not joining
in the fun last year.

21:28.625 --> 21:31.708
Thought I'd do something
about it this year.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.583
Oh, my.

21:33.583 --> 21:37.875
I remembered the way Pooh
got everybody running around

21:37.875 --> 21:40.333
all excited, like,

21:40.333 --> 21:43.583
showing how much they
cared for each other.

21:43.583 --> 21:46.708
Made me wish
I could do that.

21:46.708 --> 21:50.708
Not that an Eeyore ever
really could, mind you.

21:50.708 --> 21:53.458
Oh, but you did, Eeyore.

21:53.458 --> 21:56.708
Yes, you certainly did.
