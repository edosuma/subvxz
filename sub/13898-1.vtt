10:44.890 --> 10:48.430
I have. Um, I like to pop back
in and see how people are doing.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.190
Is that file on me? I could
trade you for this photograph.

10:54.150 --> 10:55.610
Looking for this guy?

10:55.650 --> 10:57.780
In fact, I am. He's my cousin.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.700
He's a really nice, you know,
clean cut, law abiding --

11:00.740 --> 11:03.450
He's downstairs...
in the drunk tank.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.870
This "drunk tank."
I've never heard of this before.

11:05.910 --> 11:07.370
Do you know where
I could find it?

11:07.410 --> 11:09.870
According to your file,
you know exactly where that is.

11:09.910 --> 11:12.460
You've slept in there
fourteen times.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.050
I think that's a different
Jake Doyle that you have...

11:17.090 --> 11:19.630
This was nice.
I'll see you around.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.260
Nice to meet you Jake.

11:36.610 --> 11:38.990
Rory have a party last night?

11:39.030 --> 11:40.740
Something's wrong here.

11:40.780 --> 11:43.160
The room wasn't like
this when I left.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.450
Nelson's been here.
I can feel it.

11:46.490 --> 11:48.790
Let's just stay calm until we
know what's going on.

11:48.830 --> 11:52.830
I am calm. You know, this isn't
easy for me either.

11:52.870 --> 11:55.920
Being here with you.
Having to ask for your help.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.340
Trust me, it's much harder to
listen to it, and you never had

11:59.380 --> 12:01.880
much trouble before asking me,
or your late sister for money.

12:01.930 --> 12:02.970
And a lot of it.

12:03.010 --> 12:04.890
Oh, here we go again.

12:04.930 --> 12:07.260
You really don't understand
the concept of forgive

12:07.310 --> 12:08.600
and forget now, do you?

12:10.100 --> 12:12.390
We had to re-mortgage the house
for you, and then you

12:12.440 --> 12:14.940
abandoned her, your own sister,
when she was calling for you

12:14.980 --> 12:16.020
on her deathbed.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.730
There were unforeseen
circumstances.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.990
I couldn't tell you
what was going on.

12:21.030 --> 12:23.070
I don't want to hear
any excuses from you.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.570
Let's just focus on finding your
son and then I can get you

12:25.620 --> 12:27.030
out of my life again for good.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.710
Bank slip from an ATM -- Rory
got some money out last night.

12:32.910 --> 12:35.250
I'll call Rose
and have her look into it.

12:35.290 --> 12:36.420
No, no, no, no...

12:36.460 --> 12:36.790
What?

12:38.340 --> 12:43.550
The banking fees are outrageous.
This is daylight robbery.

12:43.590 --> 12:45.260
You and your deadbeat son

12:45.300 --> 12:47.760
know all about robbery now,
don't you?

12:51.060 --> 12:52.690
Nelson.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.150
Where's Rory?

12:55.190 --> 12:57.270
What have you done with my son?

13:03.360 --> 13:05.110
Jake! How are you, cousin?
Great to see you.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.950
Thanks for springing me,
by the way.

13:06.990 --> 13:09.370
It's good to see you too, Rory,
but your father is anxious

13:09.410 --> 13:10.870
to see you, you know.
He's kinda freaking out.

13:10.910 --> 13:12.410
Ah, never mind him.
You know what he's like.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.910
He's emotional in his old age,
driving us all a bit mental.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.130
Rory, what are you doing here?
And why are you in jail?

13:19.460 --> 13:21.300
One second... There was a huge
misunderstanding.

13:21.340 --> 13:23.670
I was thrown out of a nightclub
for taking my clothes off.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.930
Apparently the patrons aren't
allow to take their clothes off,

13:25.970 --> 13:27.390
but the strippers are.

13:27.430 --> 13:30.970
You know they're funny
about that. Just --

13:31.010 --> 13:33.770
What about the Dublin gangster
guy, why is he after you?

13:33.810 --> 13:36.480
Nelson? Never mind him. You know
what Dubliners are like.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.900
We're all hard men.
And anyway, it's ah...

13:38.940 --> 13:40.270
A huge misunderstanding?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.480
It's all a bit tangly,
to be honest, Jake.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.940
-[ring]
-No doubt. No doubt.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.360
Dad, yeah.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.900
It's me.

13:46.950 --> 13:49.620
I know it's you. I just said
Dad. Anyways. I have Rory, okay?

13:49.660 --> 13:50.780
Well, that's good, but uh...

13:50.830 --> 13:52.620
Speakerphone.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.660
Uncle Malachy,
meet us outside 1 Water Street?

13:56.710 --> 13:58.790
Outside the building that looks
like there's nothing there.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.750
And there we'll be. We'll meet
you as we're coming out?

14:00.790 --> 14:02.170
Yeah? Good?

14:02.210 --> 14:04.340
That voice sounds familiar.

14:04.380 --> 14:05.590
He hung up.

14:07.010 --> 14:11.140
Let's get ourselves to that
address. Now. You drive.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.640
Where you going?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.350
C'mon cousin. You don't
want to be late, do ya?

14:15.390 --> 14:16.600
For what?

14:21.270 --> 14:23.610
So she blew up your car.
She just blew it up,

14:23.650 --> 14:24.820
the blue GTO. Why?

14:24.860 --> 14:26.900
Well it's... it's complicated.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.570
So you still have a way with
the gals, then, I see.

14:28.610 --> 14:29.990
I loved that car.

14:30.030 --> 14:32.620
Rory, stop walking and tell me
what we're doing here.

14:32.660 --> 14:34.290
I was thinking it's a massive

14:34.330 --> 14:36.700
shame that Malachy and me dad
aren't talkin' any more.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.290
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

14:38.330 --> 14:41.920
Family is everything, Jake. It
really is. Hold on one second.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.130
Rory, you're in a dumpster.
Why are you in a dump --

14:44.170 --> 14:46.340
Remember when we were kids?
When we came to visit you?

14:47.470 --> 14:48.930
I tried to ride
that shopping cart,

14:48.970 --> 14:51.010
that trolley
down the main street.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.390
What's it called?
Is it Mascot Street?

14:52.430 --> 14:53.970
Prescott Street.

14:54.010 --> 14:56.020
Yeah, right. Prescott Street.
And you told me not to do it.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.730
And did I listen to you? No.
How much fun did we have, Jake?

14:58.770 --> 15:01.310
You're forgetting that I spent,
like, seven days in the Janeway.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.310
Please tell me that
you're not about to --

15:03.360 --> 15:04.400
Inside, Jake,
as you might not know,

15:04.440 --> 15:05.360
is an illegal gambling casino,

15:05.400 --> 15:06.440
and I am about to rob it.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.150
No, you're not.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.610
That's the spirit.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.740
Rory.

15:15.490 --> 15:16.740
[gunshot]

15:16.790 --> 15:19.120
Ladies and Gentlemen,
if you'd be so kind as to

15:19.160 --> 15:20.370
put your hands in the air.

15:20.410 --> 15:22.330
Do not move.
If you move you will be killed.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.040
If you do not move,
you will not be killed.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.170
What do you think, Jake, eh?

15:26.210 --> 15:27.460
[Jake]
Drop it! Lay it down!

15:27.510 --> 15:29.420
Lay it down. I'm gonna kill you.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.680
Thank you very much, Jake.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.590
[Jake]
Stop saying my name.

15:33.090 --> 15:35.430
Gerry, I have to say, the apple
doesn't fall far from

15:35.470 --> 15:38.770
the proverbial tree, now,
does it? You and Rory.

15:38.810 --> 15:42.560
He's the spit out of your mouth.
Hopefully not as stunned.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.060
No need to be gettin' all
personal now. You don't see me

15:45.110 --> 15:46.520
pointing out that your sons
are all riddled

15:46.570 --> 15:47.900
with the herpes now, do you?

15:47.940 --> 15:49.990
Heh, heh.
You watch yourself.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.240
What do you plan to do with us?

15:52.280 --> 15:53.620
Who is this anyway, Gerry?

15:53.660 --> 15:54.620
My brother.

15:54.660 --> 15:57.540
In law. Former. Brother-in-law.

15:57.580 --> 16:00.710
Lads. If you'd be so kind to
empty your pockets and put

16:00.750 --> 16:02.460
everything on that table.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.130
Why don't we stop this
before it goes too far?

16:05.170 --> 16:07.130
Ah, but the fun is only getting
started, isn't' it?

16:07.170 --> 16:09.960
Now, let me see. I'm just gonna
get a little photograph of you.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.720
Ah, c'mon Jake, I'm just trying
to have a little bit of fun.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.260
That's quite the accent.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.680
Oh really? I like yours too,
but can you empty your pockets

16:16.720 --> 16:19.310
and put your belongings on the
table before I lose my patience.

16:19.350 --> 16:20.480
Now!

16:24.600 --> 16:25.520
Thank you.

16:26.690 --> 16:28.400
He's bluffing you.
He has a crap hand.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.150
-Say goodbye.
-Okay, bye!

16:30.190 --> 16:32.570
I don't mean literally.
Just get out!

16:33.530 --> 16:34.410
Let's go.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.490
Rory lost at cards, yes?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.790
But why travel to the end
of the world to collect?

16:40.830 --> 16:43.080
He's right, for once.
It's a tad excessive.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.540
Rory didn't lose at one of my
card games, Gerry.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.290
He robbed my entire
pot at gunpoint.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.960
Why am I not surprised?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.800
Not to mention a little personal
matter your shit son

16:51.840 --> 16:53.340
was involved with, with my --

16:55.510 --> 16:56.680
Rory?

16:56.720 --> 16:59.850
Oh hi dad! Go get the truck!
We gotta go now.

16:59.890 --> 17:01.390
Rory's running away!

17:02.980 --> 17:04.310
Rory you're an idiot.

17:04.350 --> 17:08.060
Rory, I'll tear the back
of your arse when I find ya.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.030
We'll do that later uncle
Gerald. Get in!

17:23.120 --> 17:24.960
Go.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.080
Ahh!

17:29.170 --> 17:30.670
All right?

17:30.710 --> 17:31.710
Yeah.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.460
OK. Let's take a break.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.840
Look who it is! Desbot.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.390
Des?

17:38.430 --> 17:41.890
What are ya at Tinny b'y?
I mean Katrina, b'y?

17:41.930 --> 17:43.520
How are you feeling?
Can you walk right yet or wha?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.930
I'm on the mend.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.600
I heard your scored first
in your shooting range test.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.730
How did you hear that?

17:47.770 --> 17:49.610
Tinny, I'm a P.I.
I have my ways.

17:50.650 --> 17:51.570
And by ways,
I mean Rose told me.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.690
So did you manage to get that
info for me?

17:54.740 --> 17:57.700
Yeah. Why are you so obsessed
with the guy that kidnapped us?

17:59.450 --> 18:00.990
Katrina!
Let's go.

18:01.030 --> 18:03.830
Hold on to this for me.
Don't tell anyone, okay?

18:03.870 --> 18:04.960
I'll explain later.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.290
Hey, sorry. Um...

18:09.380 --> 18:11.380
I need to borrow some money.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.380
Like two hundred dollars. Cash.

18:14.420 --> 18:15.880
Why? For what?

18:15.920 --> 18:19.430
It's just for medication.
For pain and stuff.

18:19.470 --> 18:20.640
I'll pay you back.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.810
Maybe. We can talk about
it at home later.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.270
What were you thinking?
Why were you robbin' a casino?

18:29.310 --> 18:31.230
Rory kinda sprang it at me
at the last minute.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.440
I don't know where he gets it.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.280
I just don't know
where he gets it!

18:34.320 --> 18:35.900
Not a clue huh?
Well, here's a hint.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.900
He gets it from his juvenile,
irresponsible dad, that's where.

18:38.950 --> 18:43.620
The casino is owned by a very
bad local guy. One Marko Long.

18:43.660 --> 18:46.040
He's gotta rap sheet
the size of Salmonear Line.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.620
Racketeering and loan sharking.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.830
Been in prison on the mainland
and here at Her Majesty's Pen.

18:49.870 --> 18:52.500
So now Rory not only has one
thug after him but two.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.750
What about that ATM bank
receipt. Did you track it?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.920
Yeah, I did. To a place called
Great Big She. A strip club.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.180
Also owned by Marko Long.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.680
-A strip club.
-Yeah.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.340
This is Rory's phone.

19:02.390 --> 19:05.770
He told me that he got kicked
out of a strip club last night.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.600
How much money did he pull
from the casino job?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.060
-Looking for your cut?
-Malachy!

19:09.100 --> 19:10.600
Ah, that's alright Rose.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.900
Impatience runs in the family.
I've got a touch of it too.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.440
We're not family!

19:14.480 --> 19:17.440
I am just trying to ascertain if
what he stole from the Marko

19:17.490 --> 19:18.950
fella is enough to pay back

19:18.990 --> 19:21.070
what he stole
from Nelson McNulty.

19:21.110 --> 19:24.490
Actually, he didn't steal any
money from the casino.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.620
I mean there was a money clip
with a bit of cash.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.910
But he did steal a key.

19:27.950 --> 19:29.750
Well, why don't you go
check out the strip club.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.080
That's all he needs.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.880
For the record,
it was Rose's idea

19:32.920 --> 19:34.540
and I think it was a good one.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.960
Keep us posted will ye?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.420
Don't worry uncle Ger.
We'll figure this out.

19:38.470 --> 19:39.760
[telephone rings]

19:43.760 --> 19:46.100
-It's Nelson.
-Are you going to answer it?

19:46.140 --> 19:47.810
-I can't.
-Why not?

19:47.850 --> 19:49.940
Roaming fees are insanely high.

19:52.730 --> 19:53.900
It's Malachy.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.480
Oh, this is the brother, is it?

19:55.520 --> 19:57.440
Brother-in-law! Ex!

19:57.480 --> 19:59.650
Meet me. Now.
I'll send you a location.

19:59.690 --> 20:02.990
No. We'll meet you but it needs
to be somewhere public.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.530
How does a pint sound?

20:04.570 --> 20:07.160
Fine. You have my number.
Text the address.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.050
Oh hey, I'm definitely
in the right place...

20:21.720 --> 20:23.300
You're not supposed
to be back here.

20:23.340 --> 20:27.720
I know. See I'm a union,
ah, stewart. And I'm here to ask

20:27.760 --> 20:29.640
you a few questions.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.060
Have you seen this guy today?

20:32.100 --> 20:34.730
I know he was here last night.
He was thrown out.

20:34.770 --> 20:37.190
You know,
real funny accent. Nice guy.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.480
Yeah.
His accent's super charming.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.660
He got thrown out because
my boyfriend got jealous.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.530
Who's your boyfriend?

20:50.700 --> 20:53.410
[Jake] You've got to be
kidding me. Okay, listen.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.250
This guy, he's my cousin,

20:55.290 --> 20:57.170
alright, and he's
in a bit of danger,

20:57.210 --> 20:58.710
so have you seen
him today or not?

20:59.090 --> 21:00.090
No.

21:00.130 --> 21:02.050
[clang-bang]

21:03.170 --> 21:04.550
There's someone
changing in there.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.760
I just walked past three naked
girls and you're worried

21:06.800 --> 21:08.510
about someone changing.

21:09.390 --> 21:11.680
Jake! When did you get here?

21:18.730 --> 21:20.940
Let's start over here, Nelson.
Forget about Gerald.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.360
You're dealing with me now.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.570
Is that right?

21:23.610 --> 21:25.530
How much did Rory
steal from you?

21:25.570 --> 21:27.570
Oh, this isn't only
about the money.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.910
It's about the fact that
a weasel boy from a weasel

21:29.950 --> 21:30.950
family robbed me.

21:31.410 --> 21:32.370
Plus...

21:33.870 --> 21:35.420
he slept with my wife.

21:39.290 --> 21:41.550
I didn't know you were married,
Nelson. Congratulations.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.470
Sorry about me boy and the wife
doing the dirty,

21:45.510 --> 21:48.350
but he has
his father's hormones.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.970
We can fix all of this.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.180
This is about my reputation.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.730
Your whore boy robbed 50,000
quid and made a fool of me.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.940
Go on big man. Use it then.
I dare you. In here.

22:02.530 --> 22:07.110
300,000. Two hours. Or I just
take my debt in Rory flesh.

22:07.150 --> 22:11.910
Ooh, big man. Was that 300,000
in dollars or Euros?

22:11.950 --> 22:14.750
This is Kara.
And Kara and I are together.

22:15.660 --> 22:16.750
She used to go out with Marko.

22:16.790 --> 22:18.370
I sorta still do.
This is his club.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.130
And she gave me the tip as
to where to find that key.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.960
Right. What is this key for?

22:24.460 --> 22:26.840
It's for a locker with a very
valuable statue inside.

22:27.590 --> 22:28.890
It's worth a fortune.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.220
I've got a buyer all lined up,

22:30.260 --> 22:32.220
so all we have to do
is get the statue.

22:32.260 --> 22:34.890
Marko doesn't know the buyer,
Jake, so we're gonna sell it

22:34.930 --> 22:37.310
and make loads of money
and run off together.

22:37.350 --> 22:41.020
Wow. That's really sweet. I'm so
happy for you. She seems lovely.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.990
Kara. Who are your friends
and why aren't you working?

22:48.490 --> 22:50.110
I was just --

22:50.160 --> 22:53.700
We -- I was here last night and
I got a bunch of dances from her

22:53.740 --> 22:56.290
and I didn't have any cash on me
and she didn't have the Interac.

22:56.330 --> 22:57.580
So I promised her
I'd come back and here I am.

22:59.210 --> 23:02.460
A conscientious perve. It's good
to see that chivalry isn't dead.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.010
Anyways.
See you around.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.630
Yeah, we should probably
get going too.

23:07.670 --> 23:09.880
Yeah.
Good idea, Jake.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.220
Jake?

23:12.300 --> 23:14.430
Hm. That's a nice name.

23:14.470 --> 23:15.930
Yeah, I was named after my aunt.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.940
I could have sworn that I met
you guys earlier on today.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.480
Irish leprechaun accent, right?

23:22.520 --> 23:25.020
Ha, ha, ha, excuse me?

23:25.070 --> 23:27.320
No, no, no. He's from up
the shore. He's from Calvert.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.110
That explains his oddness
and his funny accent.

23:30.150 --> 23:32.450
-Oh, I see.
-[thud]

23:32.490 --> 23:34.580
Now which one of
you two has my key?

23:34.620 --> 23:36.580
Are you suggesting a key party?

23:36.620 --> 23:39.870
Listen man, I'm not good at key
parties. I keep picking my own.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.870
You think this is a joke,
wise guy?

23:41.920 --> 23:45.590
Marko, no. No!
I've got your key.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.590
I've got your key.

23:48.630 --> 23:50.170
Just leave him out of this.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.640
He's got nothing to do with it.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.260
And then, you and me?

23:54.300 --> 23:55.100
We're going to
go get that statue.

23:55.140 --> 23:56.510
It's all good.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.350
He's going to use the key
to find just what he wants.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.390
And then you're going to pay

24:01.440 --> 24:02.600
for that little stunt you pulled
at the casino.

24:03.940 --> 24:06.150
So you call the cops,
or you try to find him,

24:06.190 --> 24:07.860
I'm going to kill him.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.950
Now you remember that.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.630
Rory's going to be okay, right?

24:26.880 --> 24:29.300
Not when Marko finds
out that this missing.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.930
Poor Rory. He sacrificed
himself to save me.

24:35.970 --> 24:39.010
Or this. Either way,
Marko's gonna find out that Rory

24:39.060 --> 24:41.100
tricked him and we ended up
with the statue.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.520
Malachy!
We have to get him back.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.980
Or somehow we have to come up
with $300,000 for Nelson.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.190
Gotta give it to you Gerald.

24:48.230 --> 24:50.400
When you mess up,
you mess up big time.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.110
But...

24:52.150 --> 24:53.950
don't worry.

24:53.990 --> 24:55.530
We'll get Rory back.

24:55.570 --> 24:57.450
What's the story
with the statue?

24:57.490 --> 24:59.200
It was made
for a Russian princess.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.870
An engagement gift from her
fiancé just before he was killed

25:01.910 --> 25:03.160
in World War One.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.870
I'm not just a stripper.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.790
I'm doing my masters
in art history at MUN.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.300
The stature belongs
to a private collector.

25:09.340 --> 25:10.590
How'd you get your hands on it?

25:10.630 --> 25:13.090
Marko has a guy on the inside.
An art restorer.

25:13.130 --> 25:14.470
No one even knows it's gone.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.340
Not yet.
What's it worth?

25:16.390 --> 25:19.010
I have a buyer overseas.
Five hundred thousand bucks.

25:19.050 --> 25:21.770
Whoa. Imagine what he'd be worth
if he had arms and legs.

25:21.810 --> 25:24.480
We can give the statue to Nelson
in exchange for Rory's debts.

25:25.730 --> 25:27.690
One problem.
You're forgetting about Marko.

25:27.730 --> 25:29.650
The guy who actually has your
son held captive.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.280
We can't get involved
in some art heist.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.650
We'll all end up in jail.

25:32.690 --> 25:33.990
If we don't use the statue,

25:34.030 --> 25:36.360
we have no leverage
to save Rory's arse.

25:36.410 --> 25:37.910
We need to bring the cops
in on this.

25:37.950 --> 25:40.030
Ah, Malachy. There's something
that Gerald hasn't told us.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.580
Huh?

25:41.620 --> 25:43.750
Well, we can't call the police
because Gerald is currently

25:43.790 --> 25:45.790
breaking parole in Ireland.

25:45.830 --> 25:47.710
They'll lock him away again.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.920
Eh, you know, don't mind me.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.340
I mean,
this is all about Rory anyway.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.420
And I honestly don't
mind going back to jail.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.180
You didn't tell us you were
breaking parole?

25:56.220 --> 25:56.840
What else are you
keeping from me?

25:56.880 --> 25:58.390
What do you expect?

25:58.430 --> 26:00.680
I can't tell you about my parole
situation because you've got

26:00.720 --> 26:02.930
so much hatred inside of ya.

26:02.970 --> 26:05.310
This is exactly the kind of
thing I expected from you.

26:05.350 --> 26:06.770
There's never a straight story.

26:06.810 --> 26:08.230
It's always jumbled
up in your lies.

26:08.270 --> 26:11.980
Dad. Can I talk to you
downstairs please, for a second.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.110
Alone. Now.

26:17.030 --> 26:21.490
Who'd like a cup of tea?
With whiskey, and ice, and...

26:21.530 --> 26:22.700
no tea.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.330
I wouldn't say no.

26:24.370 --> 26:25.660
Alright.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.000
Ahh, what are you doing?

26:31.750 --> 26:36.590
Do you honestly care about Rory
in the way I think you do?

26:42.010 --> 26:45.430
Dad, c'mon. We can't rat Gerald
out to the cops.

26:45.470 --> 26:48.850
I know. It's just one thing
after another with him.

26:48.890 --> 26:50.190
Think about mom, alright?

26:50.230 --> 26:51.310
If she was here,
if she were alive,

26:52.310 --> 26:53.400
what would she
want you to do?

26:53.440 --> 26:54.820
Break up with Rose, likely.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.190
What do you think
she'd want me to do?

26:56.230 --> 27:00.570
She'd want you to give Gerald
a chance. C'mon b'y.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.370
Think about it.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.790
Maybe he'll surprise us.

27:04.830 --> 27:06.910
Guys, I've got some bad news.
Gerald's gone.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.670
He just grabbed
the statue and left.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.170
Surprise.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.880
Nelson. I have something that --

27:19.170 --> 27:22.300
that will make all of
this go away.

27:22.340 --> 27:25.930
Something that will clear all
of Rory's debts.

27:25.970 --> 27:27.810
Everybody's on the wrong
side of the road.

27:27.850 --> 27:29.270
He stole my truck.

27:29.310 --> 27:31.560
I tried calling Gerald's phone,
but there was no answer.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.690
Probably too cheap to answer
because of the roaming.

27:33.730 --> 27:35.190
Oh yes b'y, you're one to talk.

27:35.230 --> 27:37.030
It took everything outa ya
to buy the new truck you got.

27:37.070 --> 27:38.320
I liked my old one.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.780
Uh, the chassis fell out of her.

27:39.820 --> 27:40.950
Speaking of which -- Des,

27:40.990 --> 27:42.700
any luck tracking
the truck's location?

27:42.740 --> 27:45.120
Malachy, I know you hate your
new ride, but this new rig?

27:45.160 --> 27:46.540
It has some advantages --

27:46.580 --> 27:48.410
an I-Star Road Side assistance
feature which mean --

27:48.450 --> 27:50.120
Which means we can track
the truck's location.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.370
And I can tap into
the microphone inside the truck

27:52.420 --> 27:54.460
used to communicate with
the I-Star operator.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.420
-Good.
-Great. Okay.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.340
[scrape]

28:06.470 --> 28:09.180
Ah, sure that'll buff right out.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.690
Do you have my money Gerald?
Or are things going to get ugly?

28:11.730 --> 28:13.900
They drive on the wrong side
of the road here.

28:14.810 --> 28:16.270
It's hard to get a handle on it.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.860
Gerald!

28:17.900 --> 28:19.150
My money.

28:19.190 --> 28:23.030
I don't have your money.
But, I do have an idea.

28:23.070 --> 28:24.740
An idea. Is that a joke?

28:24.780 --> 28:26.030
Got it.

28:26.070 --> 28:27.700
[Gerald] It's a special,
one time occasion

28:27.740 --> 28:31.210
for you to win back all
the money that's owed to you.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.370
Turn it up.

28:32.410 --> 28:33.960
An idea doesn't equate money.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.090
But Rory sleeping with my wife
and stealing from me does equate

28:37.130 --> 28:38.340
a bullet to the head.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.970
This is a very valuable statue.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.260
Where is it?

28:42.300 --> 28:44.340
-I don't have it on me.
-Oh, is that so?

28:44.380 --> 28:47.300
Given the very volatile nature
of our relationship,

28:47.350 --> 28:50.520
I thought it wise to, you know,
keep it hidden.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.560
-Heh, heh. It's worth $300,000.
-A statue?

28:53.600 --> 28:57.650
The statue. Worth a fortune.
And it's all yours.

28:57.690 --> 29:01.320
But you're gonna help me
to get back my son, Rory.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.110
-What's he doing?
-Des, do you have a location?

29:03.150 --> 29:04.910
Ah, sorry, almost.

29:04.950 --> 29:07.320
Why would I help you
and your ratbag son?

29:07.370 --> 29:09.830
[Gerald] Because if you don't,
you don't get nuthin'.

29:09.870 --> 29:10.910
Are you sure it's not stashed

29:10.950 --> 29:11.450
under the seat
in the truck there?

29:12.960 --> 29:14.460
Like you used to do with your
winnings in the old days?

29:15.830 --> 29:17.880
Yeah, you really are thicker
than thick, Gerald.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.090
I gotta say. If you had a clue
you'd die of loneliness.

29:21.130 --> 29:22.010
[shot]

29:22.050 --> 29:23.300
He's gonna kill him!

29:23.340 --> 29:25.300
Perhaps you've misunderstood
the particulars of

29:25.340 --> 29:27.850
our relationship --
how this works.

29:27.890 --> 29:29.720
I don't like to be crossed,
Gerald.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.100
My leg!
You shot me. Aye!

29:32.140 --> 29:34.390
You know there was a time you
owed me money and for some

29:34.440 --> 29:35.730
reason you chose not to pay me.

29:35.770 --> 29:37.480
Do you recall that time Gerald?

29:37.520 --> 29:39.730
My guys beat you so badly you
were in the hospital for weeks.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.980
You almost died.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.780
From what I remember you missed
your own sister's funeral due to

29:45.820 --> 29:48.240
that unfortunate turn of events.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.450
Am I right?

29:49.490 --> 29:53.250
[Gerald] Eh, yes, my sister, my sister.

29:53.290 --> 29:56.160
So what do you think I'm gonna
do with your son now?

29:56.210 --> 29:59.750
First, I'm gonna take
your little statue.

29:59.790 --> 30:02.460
And then I'm gonna make sure
your son never takes advantage

30:02.500 --> 30:04.170
of another man's wife again.

30:04.220 --> 30:05.760
Are we clear?

30:07.090 --> 30:08.760
We don't need the cavalry.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.560
Des! C'mon.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.600
Okay. I got a location.
Ah, Logy Bay Road.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.480
Alright. Dad, you call 911
and get over there.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.140
[telephone rings]

30:17.190 --> 30:18.230
It's Rory!

30:18.980 --> 30:20.440
Hello.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.940
Heh, heh. Jake. How are ya,
buddy? Um, I kinda need your

30:23.980 --> 30:25.190
help at the minute.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.490
It seems that Marko's
gonna cut my ears off

30:26.530 --> 30:27.990
if I don't get him the statue.

30:28.030 --> 30:29.950
Which is a tad bit extreme
seeing as I need them to hear

30:29.990 --> 30:31.660
and to talk to people.

30:32.910 --> 30:34.950
Was it Kara? Hm?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.620
Did she lead you to the statue?

30:36.660 --> 30:38.620
Listen man. I got no idea what
you're talking about.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.250
But here's an idea. Why don't
you send Rory over and --

30:42.290 --> 30:46.630
You bring me the statue. Or Rory
ends up an earless corpse.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.560
Marko's gonna kill Rory.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.060
Hey, I screwed up again,
didn't I?

30:58.100 --> 31:02.150
I'm not fit to mind mice
at the crossroads.

31:02.190 --> 31:04.860
A constant disappointment to
myself and to others.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.820
I'm sorry, Mal.

31:09.990 --> 31:10.870
I'm sorry.

31:12.530 --> 31:16.540
I've always prided myself as a
person who didn't judge others.

31:16.580 --> 31:20.170
To imagine another person's
circumstances before I take

31:20.210 --> 31:21.750
a point of view
as to who they are.

31:21.790 --> 31:25.550
But with you,
the truth is Gerald,

31:26.460 --> 31:29.590
I never gave you
a fair shot.

31:29.630 --> 31:31.930
And from this moment,
that's over.

31:33.510 --> 31:35.810
I heard the whole conversation
with Nelson over the speaker

31:35.850 --> 31:37.560
in my truck.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.430
I didn't realize...

31:39.480 --> 31:42.560
Well, whatever grief
you've given me,

31:42.600 --> 31:45.400
I deserved
every inch of it.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.610
Let's not go in circles.
Let's just... Just promise to be

31:48.650 --> 31:50.820
good to each other
from here on in.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.240
Like brothers.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.450
In law.

31:53.490 --> 31:54.580
Oh.

31:55.870 --> 31:56.830
But yeah.

31:56.870 --> 31:58.290
Do me a favor then, will ya?

31:59.660 --> 32:00.830
Hmm...

32:02.170 --> 32:03.080
Anything.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.750
Cancel my
cell phone plan.

32:04.790 --> 32:08.460
Nelson McNulty stole my phone
and he's rackin' up the charges.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.720
I just know he is.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.550
Nelson has your phone now?

32:11.590 --> 32:12.760
Yeah.

32:15.050 --> 32:16.600
I think I have a plan.

32:16.640 --> 32:21.230
So, being a stripper -- sorry,
provocative dancer --

32:21.270 --> 32:24.020
Is there a lot of growth in that
industry? I mean, I'm not going

32:24.060 --> 32:26.940
to get into it myself, but one
never wants to limit oneself.

32:28.190 --> 32:30.400
I'm just so worried about Rory.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.110
I don't know what
I'll do if he's hurt.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.360
Hey Jake, any news on Gerald?

32:33.410 --> 32:34.780
What about my Rory?

32:34.820 --> 32:37.580
Rory's gonna be fine. But he's
gonna need your help.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.740
What can I do?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.660
Well...

32:40.700 --> 32:41.910
how's your poker face?

32:47.590 --> 32:50.050
It's ringing.
What if he doesn't pick up?

32:50.090 --> 32:51.550
Don't worry. He will.

32:51.590 --> 32:53.680
Just do everything we talked
about, okay? You'll be fine.

32:53.720 --> 32:54.890
Put it on speakerphone.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.760
[telephone rings]

32:59.560 --> 33:00.060
What do you want?

33:01.100 --> 33:03.310
I want my statue.
Where's Gerald?

33:03.350 --> 33:05.060
Gerald's not hear right now.
Who is this?

33:05.940 --> 33:06.810
[bang]

33:08.940 --> 33:11.650
I'm looking to purchase this
statue. Is this still possible?

33:13.190 --> 33:16.910
Yeah. Yeah. I'm uh, actually
working on Gerald's behalf.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.910
Well, if you think a new
negotiator is going to

33:19.950 --> 33:22.660
change things, you're wrong.
We agreed to five hundred.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.080
[coughs]

33:24.460 --> 33:25.960
Thousand?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.840
I'm not paying more, if that's
what you're suggesting.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.340
Ah, yeah, well it's um...

33:33.260 --> 33:34.510
Five hundred thousand is fine.

33:34.550 --> 33:35.640
Good. Now where are we meeting?

33:36.760 --> 33:38.300
Time's running out.
I want my statue.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.140
[bang]

33:41.060 --> 33:43.020
Newfoundland Hotel. Room 706.

33:43.060 --> 33:44.140
Be there in an hour.

33:44.180 --> 33:45.940
You did great. You did great.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.730
Des. What the hell
is wrong with you?

33:47.770 --> 33:48.860
I'm sorry. It's slippery.

33:48.900 --> 33:51.150
Your turn.

33:54.150 --> 33:57.700
Marko, buddy. I think I got
something that belongs to you.

33:57.740 --> 33:59.910
[bang]

34:09.960 --> 34:11.300
If he looks past this top layer
in twenties, this whole thing

34:11.340 --> 34:12.920
is going to be blown.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.800
Just make him prove to you that
the statue is authentic before

34:15.840 --> 34:17.300
you show him the money.

34:17.340 --> 34:18.640
You think you're going
to be able to handle this?

34:18.680 --> 34:20.760
I'm a big girl.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.810
Besides, I've danced in almost
all these rooms before.

34:23.850 --> 34:25.980
I know my way around.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.600
That's pretty hot.
I'm not going to lie to you.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.560
Uh, shouldn't we be talking
about the plan, Jake?

34:31.610 --> 34:33.980
Des will be in the room next
to yours in case anything goes

34:34.030 --> 34:34.900
wrong and you need...

34:35.280 --> 34:36.860
Security.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.530
Although I should mention this
is my first day back on the job,

34:38.570 --> 34:40.320
so if you could keep your
expectations, like, crazy

34:40.370 --> 34:41.280
super low --

34:41.330 --> 34:42.370
-Bye, bye. [slap]
-Ow!

34:48.080 --> 34:50.750
So, uh, I'm in position.

34:50.790 --> 34:52.380
We're all here.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.920
[Rose in headphones] Hotel key
for room 706 on the counter.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.970
You look very nice today, Rose.

34:57.010 --> 34:58.300
Thank you.

35:01.390 --> 35:02.600
Got him.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.980
So, uh, you having a game of
pocket pool there? Or --

35:09.020 --> 35:10.940
You know you're a real pain in
the ass -- where my statue?

35:10.980 --> 35:11.980
Where's Rory?

35:12.020 --> 35:13.150
You get Rory
when I get my statue.

35:13.190 --> 35:14.360
It's funny.
I got the exact same rules.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.900
You got two options.
Number one.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.820
You can kill me right here in
this lobby in public.

35:19.860 --> 35:21.110
That way you get nothing.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.780
Or you meet me on the seventh
floor, with Rory.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.330
[mouth-click]
It's up to you.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.510
No more games.

35:36.550 --> 35:38.300
You all right, Rory?

35:38.340 --> 35:39.720
I'm fine Jake.
Would you get on with this?

35:39.760 --> 35:40.890
This guy is starting
to drive me mad.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.760
Okay, look. Room 706, alright?

35:44.800 --> 35:47.180
You give me Rory,
you can have your statue.

35:48.100 --> 35:49.730
How do I know it's not a trap?

35:49.770 --> 35:51.480
It's not a trap.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.310
It's the location where Kara is
right now getting ready to sell

35:54.360 --> 35:56.360
that statue to a buyer.

35:57.110 --> 35:58.860
She wouldn't do that.

35:59.780 --> 36:01.450
Kara's selling it to a buyer?

36:01.490 --> 36:04.450
Yeah. In fact she's alone
in there right now.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.290
I'd say you got about, uh...

36:07.330 --> 36:09.870
twenty minutes
before the buyer arrives.

36:09.910 --> 36:10.620
She's selling me out?

36:12.250 --> 36:14.210
She said she couldn't tell me
the name of the buyer because

36:14.250 --> 36:15.790
it would scare him off.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.710
Alright, alright.

36:17.750 --> 36:20.050
I'll show her scared off.
Take me to the room.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.010
-Whatever you say.
-Take me to the room!

36:22.050 --> 36:23.220
I heard you.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.270
So -- it's the real deal.
You can see.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.770
Kara?

36:31.810 --> 36:33.100
Hey that's my statue!

36:33.150 --> 36:34.360
Who the hell are you?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.070
-[gunshot]
-Ooof!

36:37.110 --> 36:38.190
Aw!

36:38.230 --> 36:39.860
-Oh no you don't.
-[ding]

36:42.400 --> 36:44.370
[punch] [thud]

36:49.660 --> 36:50.830
Ohh!

36:52.410 --> 36:54.670
Oh I'm so sorry.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.130
Ahh!

36:57.750 --> 36:59.260
[punch]

36:59.760 --> 37:00.920
Nice work.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.340
Everyone, okay?

37:04.380 --> 37:07.100
Yeah. I'm fine.
So thank you for asking.

37:08.010 --> 37:09.720
[Rory]
Dad, you all right?

37:09.770 --> 37:12.890
[Gerald]
Yeah, son, I'm fine.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.150
What are you at?
Getting us all into this?

37:15.190 --> 37:16.860
Ah! Dad, what are you at? Relax!

37:16.900 --> 37:19.110
Ha ha! Nice.

37:19.150 --> 37:21.610
Show some respect
for your family.

37:21.650 --> 37:22.780
Ah, b'y.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.410
-Pint?
-Pint?

37:31.620 --> 37:34.000
So -- you collared an
international criminal

37:34.040 --> 37:36.460
and a wanted local
on the same day.

37:36.500 --> 37:39.170
Plus an extremely
valuable statue.

37:39.210 --> 37:41.670
Ah, right. The old hat trick.

37:42.210 --> 37:42.880
Good on ya.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.430
Why'd you stop being a cop?

37:46.390 --> 37:48.180
Ah, let's talk about you.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.010
When did you start being so hot?

37:50.050 --> 37:52.850
Was it elementary school or high
school when you first noticed?

37:52.890 --> 37:55.440
Touchy topic, I see.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.850
Well Jake,
perhaps we'll see you around.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.690
But hopefully in a way
that doesn't involve

37:59.730 --> 38:00.900
me arresting you.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.490
I agree.

38:04.570 --> 38:06.780
Dan Tanna does it again.
Big whoop.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.120
Hood.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.160
About Leslie.
I need to know man.

38:16.790 --> 38:21.050
Just... whatever you can tell
me. Is she okay? Is she sick?

38:21.090 --> 38:22.170
What?

38:24.590 --> 38:26.420
She's okay.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.470
But I can't tell you
anymore than that.

38:28.510 --> 38:32.720
As far as you're concerned,
she's gone. Okay?

38:46.280 --> 38:47.400
What's on the go?

38:47.450 --> 38:48.610
This is it.

38:50.740 --> 38:52.120
This is yours.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.960
You wanna tell
me what this is all about?

38:59.880 --> 39:01.000
I will.

39:01.750 --> 39:02.670
I promise.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.460
Just not yet.

39:09.220 --> 39:12.390
I'm going to need that two
hundred bucks.

39:12.430 --> 39:16.100
I'll pay you back, but my
money's tied up right now...

39:16.140 --> 39:18.850
in some awesome investments,
but the dividends should more

39:18.890 --> 39:21.190
than cover what I owe you.

39:21.230 --> 39:22.730
So this is for the pain.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.610
Des, should I be worried here?

39:26.650 --> 39:27.860
No.

39:35.200 --> 39:42.080
Ah, what an adventure for
a family to go on, hmm?

39:42.130 --> 39:44.290
You can really defend yourself.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.210
Thanks, Uncle Ger.
I have to say,

39:46.250 --> 39:49.010
even though you did
almost kill our entire family,

39:49.050 --> 39:50.680
it's great to see you again.

39:51.140 --> 39:52.260
Thanks.

39:55.220 --> 39:58.600
I see Rory's landed on his feet
pretty good there.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.190
He says he loves this one.

40:01.230 --> 40:04.980
I can't really blame him.
She is very, very talented.

40:07.400 --> 40:12.820
You know, if your mother
were alive today...

40:14.490 --> 40:17.240
she'd be very proud of you.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.670
I'm proud of you too.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.210
Thank you, Uncle Gerald.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.800
You're a good man.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.800
And you're my favorite uncle.

40:36.050 --> 40:39.770
Ha ha! Now.
That'll get you a real drink.

40:39.810 --> 40:41.440
[phone rings]

40:46.230 --> 40:47.980
Jake Doyle.

40:49.610 --> 40:55.530
[Jake] Hello...? Hello...? Hello...?

41:03.540 --> 41:04.620
Who was that?

41:04.670 --> 41:05.960
It was just a hang-up.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.710
Um, you need to come with us.

41:07.750 --> 41:10.340
Like, right now.
C'mon. I'll drive.

41:10.380 --> 41:11.590
C'mon.

41:19.470 --> 41:21.600
What is this? What are we doing
here at a cab company?

41:21.640 --> 41:23.270
Jake! Whaddya at?

41:23.310 --> 41:26.520
Please don't tell me that
Ned Bishop is my big surprise.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.900
[Des]
No, no, no, no, no.

41:29.940 --> 41:33.450
This -- is a gift
from me to you.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.150
You're gonna love it,
Uncle Jake.

41:35.200 --> 41:39.870
Cuz even though you kinda got me
shot, you're my best friend

41:39.910 --> 41:41.490
in the entire world.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.460
I kinda think of you as a
brother, and brothers do

41:43.500 --> 41:46.630
nice things for each other.
So...

42:05.560 --> 42:07.100
Like I told the weird boy...

42:07.150 --> 42:09.310
Car restoration
is an expensive racket.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.020
Now I'm not a licensed
car dealer,

42:11.070 --> 42:13.780
so this is a secret- style deal.

42:15.030 --> 42:16.240
Ah...

42:18.820 --> 42:20.410
I don't know what to say.

42:25.330 --> 42:26.870
It's perfect.

42:30.090 --> 42:31.090
It's perfect.
