WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:10.041
OH, JOEY,
YOU WOOK WADIANT.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.834
[CHUCKLES] WHAT?

00:11.834 --> 00:12.834
Pacey:
I BELIEVE SHE SAID,

00:12.834 --> 00:14.000
"OH, JOEY,
YOU LOOK RADIANT."

00:14.000 --> 00:15.959
AND I COULD NOT
AGREE MORE

00:15.959 --> 00:17.500
WITH YOUR WISE
ASSESSMENT, BESS.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.250
JOEY POTTER,
YOU DO LOOK
ABSOLUTELY RADIANT.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.667
I DON'T LOOK RADIANT.
I LOOK SILLY.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.000
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, JO.
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
DIGNIFY THAT COMMENT

00:26.000 --> 00:27.583
WITH A RESPONSE.

00:27.583 --> 00:30.500
PACEY, THE PROM?
WHAT ARE WE, LIKE,
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.667
YEAH. WE ARE
IN HIGH SCHOOL
LAST TIME I CHECKED.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.792
NOT TO MENTION I DON'T
HAVE THE BEST TRACK RECORD
FOR THESE EVENTS.

00:35.792 --> 00:37.500
I MEAN, NEED I REMIND YOU,

00:37.500 --> 00:39.917
OF THE DEBACLE THAT WAS
LAST YEAR'S ANTI-PROM?

00:39.917 --> 00:42.166
OH, GOD, I FORGOT
TO PICK UP ALEXANDER.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.500
OH, MY GOD. SHE FORGOT
TO PICK UP ALEXANDER.

00:44.500 --> 00:44.834
PACEY, YOU FINISH.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.208
OK.

00:49.208 --> 00:50.125
OK.

00:50.125 --> 00:53.000
SO...YOU LIKE MY DRESS?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.375
WELL, I BELIEVE I ALREADY
USED THE WORD RADIANT.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.625
WELL, ACTUALLY,
'CAUSE I KIND OF FIGURED

00:57.625 --> 00:59.000
THAT THE DRESS
REALLY ISN'T THE PART

00:59.000 --> 01:01.458
THAT THE GUYS CARE ABOUT.

01:01.458 --> 01:05.041
IT'S REALLY THE AFTER-PROM
WHEN THE DRESS COMES OFF.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.083
SPEAKING OF PROM,
I NEED FOR YOU TO GO

01:06.083 --> 01:08.792
AND PICK UP
THE PROM TICKETS.

01:08.792 --> 01:09.875
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
PICK UP THE PROM TICKETS.

01:09.875 --> 01:11.041
WELL, I TRIED
TO PICK UP
THE PROM TICKETS,

01:11.041 --> 01:13.625
BUT MY POOR
ACADEMIC STANDING

01:13.625 --> 01:15.291
HAS PUT ME ON
"THE DO NOT SELL TO"
LIST.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.500
DID YOU REMEMBER
THE LIMO?

01:16.500 --> 01:17.625
YEAH. YEAH, I
REMEMBERED THE LIMO.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.667
I TOLD YOU
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.792
WELL, PACEY, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING YOURSELF.

01:21.792 --> 01:24.250
I MEAN, I CAN HANDLE
SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.959
I WANT TO. OK?

01:25.959 --> 01:26.917
I WANT TO TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.417
I WANT TO MAKE THIS
PERFECT FOR YOU.

01:28.417 --> 01:30.250
SWEETHEART...

01:30.250 --> 01:32.875
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE THIS PERFECT.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.583
WELL, THAT'S SWEET
OF YOU TO SAY,

01:35.583 --> 01:36.583
BUT I'D
LIKE TO TRY ANYWAY,

01:36.583 --> 01:37.959
IF THAT'S
ALL THE SAME TO YOU.

01:37.959 --> 01:39.542
AND SPEAKING OF,
I REALLY SHOULD

01:39.542 --> 01:40.625
KIND OF
GET ON MY WAY.

01:40.625 --> 01:42.417
BUT I LOVE YOU, JO.

01:42.417 --> 01:45.208
AND...
YOU DESERVE TO HAVE

01:45.208 --> 01:46.667
THE MOST AMAZING
SENIOR PROM

01:46.667 --> 01:47.875
THAT ANYONE
HAS EVER HAD,

01:47.875 --> 01:50.750
AND THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU, OK?

01:50.750 --> 01:51.708
SO,
FROM HERE ON OUT,

01:51.708 --> 01:54.041
SMOOTH SAILING,
I PROMISE.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.500
[RIP]

01:58.583 --> 02:00.375
DAMN.

02:48.458 --> 02:49.041
[LAUGHTER]

02:49.041 --> 02:50.208
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

02:50.208 --> 02:55.417
SO THERE I AM.
15 YEARS OLD.

02:55.417 --> 02:56.834
I'M AT THIS GIRL'S
SENIOR PROM,

02:56.834 --> 02:58.750
AND I'VE JUST
CONFESSED TO HER
THAT I'M GAY.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.000
AND WHAT DOES SHE
DO IN RESPONSE?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.375
SHE STICKS HER TONGUE
ALL THE WAY
DOWN MY THROAT!

03:02.375 --> 03:03.625
IT GETS WORSE.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.417
SHE TAKES MY HAND,
AND SHE STICKS IT
ON HER CROTCH,

03:05.417 --> 03:08.458
AND SHE SAYS,
"YOU MAY THINK
YOU'RE GAY NOW,

03:08.458 --> 03:11.333
HONEY, BUT GIVE ME
AN HOUR, AND I'LL
ROCK YOUR WORLD!"

03:11.333 --> 03:12.875
NO WAY!
THAT'S CRAZY!

03:12.875 --> 03:14.000
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.291
HEY, BUT DON'T
LET MY HORROR
STORY FOOL YOU.

03:16.291 --> 03:17.333
I'M SURE YOU GUYS
WILL HAVE A GREAT
TIME AT YOUR PROM.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.333
I GOTTA GO.
I GOT A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.166
OH, YEAH.
FINAL ONE
AFTER THE INCIDENT.

03:22.166 --> 03:23.333
BYE, JEN.
BYE,
SWEETIE.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.792
GOOD LUCK
FINDIN' A DRESS.

03:24.792 --> 03:26.333
AND, UH, YOU CAN
KEEP THE MAGAZINES.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.834
OOH--I'M DOIN'
THE COSMO  SEX QUIZ,
THOUGH.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.792
JACK,
GIVE ME A CALL.
SEE YA LATER.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.792
AND, UH, I WANT
TO HEAR ALL ABOUT

03:30.792 --> 03:32.917
THE PROM-RELATED
DETAILS.
YOU GOT IT.

03:32.917 --> 03:34.250
BYE.
SEE YA LATER.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.333
BYE-BYE!

03:36.917 --> 03:39.875
THAT IS TOO FUNNY.
HEH.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.417
DON'T EVEN SAY IT.

03:43.417 --> 03:44.583
I DIDN'T SAY
A THING.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

03:46.333 --> 03:48.417
AND THE ANSWER IS
"NO, I AM NOT ASKING
TOBEY TO THE PROM."

03:48.417 --> 03:50.708
WHY THE HELL NOT?
JACK, YOU GUYS

03:50.708 --> 03:51.792
ARE GETTING ALONG
REALLY WELL,

03:51.792 --> 03:54.875
AND IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU HAVE
FUN TOGETHER.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.583
PLUS, HE OBVIOUSLY
WANTS YOU TO ASK HIM.

03:56.583 --> 03:58.875
I MEAN, EVERY OTHER WORD
OUT OF HIS MOUTH
IS "PROM."

03:58.875 --> 04:00.959
DO YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR?
REMEMBER WITH ETHAN?

04:00.959 --> 04:04.000
ALL THE CONTROVERSY--
CRAZY BARBARA JOHNS,
THE WHOLE ANTI-PROM THING?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.208
JACK, NOBODY CARES.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.458
JUST TAKE THE BOY
TO PROM.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.667
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK YOU'RE TRYIN'

04:08.667 --> 04:09.583
TO GET OUT OF
THIS WHOLE PROM THING
ALTOGETHER.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.875
THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS REALLY ALL ABOUT.

04:11.875 --> 04:12.750
NOW, JUST PICK
A DRESS, J!

04:12.750 --> 04:14.250
WILL YOU NOT
CHANGE THE SUBJECT?

04:14.250 --> 04:15.750
JACK, I CAN GO STAG.
IT'S FINE.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.250
WE'RE BOTH AWARE OF TOBEY'S
MORE-THAN-PLATONIC FEELINGS.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.458
NOW, IF I ASK HIM
TO GO TO THE PROM,

04:20.458 --> 04:21.875
IT'S LIKE
I'M LEADING HIM ON!

04:21.875 --> 04:24.000
JACK, ALL I'M SAY--
I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.083
JEN, DROP IT!
THAT'S IT! AH--
BUT THAT'S--

04:26.083 --> 04:26.917
THAT'S IT!
STOP! SHH!
NO--

04:26.917 --> 04:29.000
PICK A DRESS.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.166
DO YOU THINK
THIS ONE'S
TOO TIGHT?

04:32.166 --> 04:33.583
NO,
YOU LOOK PERFECT.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.208
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
LOOK LIKE A BIG,
STUPID FREAK.

04:36.208 --> 04:38.250
UH, YEAH,
IN WHAT UNIVERSE?

04:38.250 --> 04:41.166
SHE'S RIGHT.
YOU LOOK...

04:41.166 --> 04:42.959
LUMINOUS!

04:42.959 --> 04:44.250
LIKE A BIG,
LUMINOUS FREAK.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.000
WE ARE GONNA
LOOK GREAT.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.208
AS LONG AS
GRETCHEN THINKS SO.

04:49.208 --> 04:50.875
OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DID YOU GET THE CORSAGE?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.917
PACEY SAID HE'D
PICK UP MINE WHEN
HE PICKED UP JOEY'S.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.458
LIMO?
PACEY.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.583
I GUESS WE GOT EVERYTHING
COVERED THEN.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.291
YOU KNOW,
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE

04:57.291 --> 04:58.208
WITH A RIGHT
TO FEEL LIKE A FREAK.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.291
MY SENIOR PROM
WAS LAST CENTURY.

05:01.291 --> 05:02.291
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

05:02.291 --> 05:03.792
IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF DEPRESSING.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.458
YOU DON'T SEEM
ALL THAT DEPRESSED.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.458
YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE I'M NOT.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.291
I-I'M UP FOR THAT
KICK-ASS JOB IN BOSTON,

05:08.291 --> 05:09.750
WHICH IS SUPER EXCITING,

05:09.750 --> 05:11.542
AND I FEEL LIKE THE PROM
WILL BE THIS FUN TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE

05:11.542 --> 05:14.083
ON THE ARM OF A GUY
I'M TOTALLY INTO.

05:14.083 --> 05:15.542
WHAT'S THERE TO BE
DEPRESSED ABOUT?

05:15.542 --> 05:17.250
Jack: ACTUALLY, UH,

05:17.250 --> 05:19.125
THERE IS ONE MORE TRADITION
THAT I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.208
WHAT'S THAT?

05:20.208 --> 05:21.125
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.792
ARE YOU OR ARE YOU
NOT GONNA FULFILL

05:22.792 --> 05:26.792
THE LONG-STANDING
TEENAGE TRADITION
OF AFTER-PROM SEX?

05:26.792 --> 05:29.583
I DECLINE TO RESPOND
TO THAT LINE
OF QUESTIONING.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.291
HOW ARE YOU,
MISS LINDLEY?

05:31.291 --> 05:33.583
SEEMS TO ME
THAT EVER SINCE
WE GOT BACK

05:33.583 --> 05:36.333
FROM NEW YORK,
YOU SEEM
A LITTLE...

05:36.333 --> 05:38.375
HORRIBLY MESSED UP?

05:38.375 --> 05:39.083
I WAS GONNA
SAY SAD.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.458
MMM--I'M SAD.

05:40.458 --> 05:43.500
AND HORRIBLY MESSED UP
AND...YOU KNOW,

05:43.500 --> 05:45.583
TERRIFIED OF THE FUTURE
AND HAUNTED BY THE PAST,

05:45.583 --> 05:48.500
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I FEEL REALLY GOOD
ABOUT THINGS.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.333
ALL I'M SAYIN' IS
IF YOU WERE GONNA DO IT

05:49.333 --> 05:51.291
ON PROM NIGHT,
JUST...YOU KNOW,

05:51.291 --> 05:53.208
BE CAREFUL, MAN.
THAT'S ALL.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.500
I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN, BUT
IF WE WERE PLANNING

05:55.500 --> 05:57.959
ON FOLLOWING THROUGH
IN ANY TRADITIONS,

05:57.959 --> 05:59.750
I'VE GOT MY EMOTIONAL
BASES COVERED.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.458
AH. GOOD TO KNOW.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.542
BUT I ADMIT TO NOTHING.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.875
SO WHY DON'T I
FEEL PERFECT?

06:04.875 --> 06:08.333
IN THE WORDS OF
MY FORMER THERAPIST,
"WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?"

06:08.333 --> 06:11.417
HMM, WELL,
I'M TERRIFIED
OF THE FUTURE,

06:11.417 --> 06:14.375
FOR ONE THING.
AND A COUPLE
OF WEEKS AGO,

06:14.375 --> 06:16.542
I HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF A SCARE.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.583
BUT THAT'S
NOT EVEN IT.

06:17.583 --> 06:21.333
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S PACEY.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.375
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEN,

06:23.375 --> 06:26.041
IT JUST DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE HE'S
TOO EAGER TO...

06:26.041 --> 06:27.750
TO TOUCH ME.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.291
I'M SURE HE'S
JUST WAITING FOR YOU
TO COME TO HIM.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.041
YOU THINK?

06:34.917 --> 06:38.542
YEAH, IT MAKES SENSE.
I MEAN, HE PROBABLY
IS JUST WAITING.

06:38.542 --> 06:39.834
YEAH.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.291
JEN, WHAT IF HE'S
NOT WAITING FOR ME?

06:44.291 --> 06:46.250
HEY!
HEY.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.708
I WAS JUST
THINKIN' ABOUT YOU.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.166
HENCE
MY EAR-TO-EAR GRIN.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.792
I DIDN'T GET THAT JOB
IN BOSTON.

06:52.792 --> 06:54.708
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

06:54.708 --> 06:56.208
THE WOMAN
FROM THE MAGAZINE--

06:56.208 --> 06:58.041
SHE JUST PAGED ME,
AND I CALLED HER BACK.

06:58.041 --> 06:59.750
SHE SAID THAT
SHE LOVED ME

06:59.750 --> 07:00.959
AND THAT I WAS
PERFECT FOR IT,

07:00.959 --> 07:02.750
BUT THAT I DIDN'T
HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE

07:02.750 --> 07:04.083
OR THE NECESSARY
EXPERIENCE.

07:04.083 --> 07:04.917
OH, GOD, THAT SUCKS.

07:04.917 --> 07:07.417
I'M SORRY.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.750
I REALLY THOUGHT
I HAD IT.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.291
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

07:15.291 --> 07:18.208
IF YOU WANT TO SKIP
THIS WHOLE PROM THING,

07:18.208 --> 07:19.750
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.583
NO. NO,
DAWSON, COME ON.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.792
THIS IS--THIS IS
YOUR MILESTONE, NOT MINE.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.750
AND YOU DESERVE
TO HAVE IT BE A WONDERFUL
AND MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE.

07:27.750 --> 07:28.917
AND THAT'S
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.667
ARE YOU SURE?

07:30.667 --> 07:34.417
YES.
YES, IT'S FINE.

07:34.417 --> 07:36.583
IT'S MORE THAN FINE.
IT'S GONNA KICK ASS.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.708
I PROMISE.
OK.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.750
I'M TELLING YOU,
TOBEY, HE DESPERATELY
WANTS TO ASK YOU.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.125
HE'S--HE'S JUST
TOO EMBARRASSED,
YOU KNOW.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.959
HE'S GOT A REALLY
IRRATIONAL FEAR
OF REJECTION.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.125
MMM, I DON'T KNOW, JEN.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.125
I-IT JUST DIDN'T
SEEM LIKE JACK WANTED
TO ASK ME TO PROM.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.708
WOULD I MAKE THIS UP?

07:56.708 --> 08:00.625
LOOK, HE...IS
A SEETHING QUAGMIRE
OF NEUROSES.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.041
YOU--YOU REAL--
YOU JUST--YOU DON'T
EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.166
I MEAN, HOW SOMEBODY
SO GOOD-LOOKING

08:03.166 --> 08:06.291
COULD BE SO INSECURE,
IT'S...BEYOND ME.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.959
BUT I ASSURE YOU,
HE REALLY WANTS YOU
TO GO TO PROM WITH HIM.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.458
HE TOLD ME SO.
THE GUY BEGGED ME
TO COME OVER HERE

08:12.458 --> 08:16.166
AND ASK YOU,
SO JUST--JUST CALL
HIM AND SAY YES.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.708
HMM?

08:41.375 --> 08:43.375
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT?

08:43.375 --> 08:44.959
NOBODY'S HOME.

08:44.959 --> 08:48.000
BESSIE, BODIE,
ALEXANDER--ALL GONE.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.542
AND THERE ARE
NO GUESTS HERE.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.834
SO, BASICALLY,
THAT MEANS

08:52.834 --> 08:56.291
WE HAVE THE WHOLE PLACE

19:07.125 --> 19:08.458
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

19:08.458 --> 19:10.041
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

19:10.041 --> 19:11.166
NOBODY REALLY
NOTICES ANYBODY ELSE

19:11.166 --> 19:12.291
AT THESE THINGS ANYWAY.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.041
THEY'RE ALL SO CAUGHT UP
IN THEIR OWN MELODRAMAS.

19:14.041 --> 19:16.625
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ME
FEEL ANY BETTER.

WELL, IN THAT CASE,
IF ANYBODY ASKS,

19:18.583 --> 19:20.083
YOU CAN JUST TELL THEM
YOU'RE CHAPERONING.

19:20.083 --> 19:22.792
OK. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

19:22.792 --> 19:24.542

FOR THAT COMMENT.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.458

BE ENJOYING

OFFERED ME 50 BUCKS

19:38.083 --> 19:39.458

GETTING PAID IN FULL.

CHARACTER VERSIONS

19:58.333 --> 19:59.500
OF A HUMAN, YOU KNOW,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.208

FROM SNOW WHITE

20:01.208 --> 20:02.625
OR SOMETHING.

20:02.625 --> 20:03.500

20:03.500 --> 20:05.291
THE FIRST GUY
TO BREAK MY HEART,

20:05.291 --> 20:07.542
HE LOOKED
JUST LIKE TED DANSON.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.625
IS THAT FUNNY?

20:10.625 --> 20:11.708
TED DANSON, HUH?

20:11.708 --> 20:13.208

20:49.041 --> 20:50.959
YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.959
A PROM.

20:52.959 --> 20:54.417
I'M SERIOUS.

20:54.417 --> 20:55.250
UH, WELL, LOOK,

20:55.250 --> 20:58.792

TO DISAPPOINT YOU, JO.

BOTHERING ME.

EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

SO, WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM?

21:07.667 --> 21:09.834
PACEY,
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

21:09.834 --> 21:12.417
THE "EVERYTHING'S
GREAT" IS THE PROBLEM.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.208
I MEAN,
EVER SINCE YOU GOT BACK

21:14.208 --> 21:17.291
FROM THAT FISHING TRIP
OR WHATEVER IT WAS,

21:17.291 --> 21:18.834
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN WALKING AROUND

I UNDERSTAND IT,

WHO YOU WANT ME TO BE.

THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND--

21:44.917 --> 21:46.125
THAT IS
SO UNTRUE, PACEY.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.750

21:47.750 --> 21:49.792
ABOUT THE LIMO

LIKE I'M HAPPY,

YOU GET ANGRY
WITH ME.

22:03.041 --> 22:04.625

SHOULD STOP ACTING

22:04.625 --> 22:05.708

28:37.542 --> 28:39.333
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO HAVE
SEX WITH ME ON THE TABLE.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.375
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
TOBEY.

28:40.375 --> 28:41.208
I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU

28:41.208 --> 28:42.083
THAT THIS IS
STRICTLY PLATONIC

28:42.083 --> 28:43.917
BEFORE YOU'RE
GONNA BELIEVE ME?

28:43.917 --> 28:45.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:45.333 --> 28:46.542
I DON'T BUY THAT.

28:46.542 --> 28:48.083
NOTHING THAT
HAS HAPPENED TONIGHT

28:48.083 --> 28:49.375
HAS BEEN PLATONIC.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.708
NOT FROM THE WAY
WE'VE BEEN LAUGHING

28:50.708 --> 28:51.750
OR FLIRTING,

28:51.750 --> 28:52.834
AND CERTAINLY NOT
THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT ME

28:52.834 --> 28:53.333
WHEN YOU CAME
TO PICK ME UP TONIGHT.

28:53.333 --> 28:55.417
YOU'RE WRONG.

28:55.417 --> 28:56.208
NO...

28:56.208 --> 28:58.625
I'M NOT.

28:58.625 --> 28:59.583
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF,

28:59.583 --> 29:00.667
BUT IT'S NOT ME.

29:00.667 --> 29:01.834
AND I SUGGEST
YOU FIGURE IT OUT,

29:01.834 --> 29:02.959
OR RISK
LOSING A CHANCE

29:02.959 --> 29:05.041
AT SOMETHING
REALLY GOOD SOMEDAY.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.458
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.083
PACEY, WE WERE
JUST DANCING.

30:10.083 --> 30:11.875
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE TO ME,
JUST DANCING.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.000
OH, COME ON.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.458
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT DAWSON,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

30:14.458 --> 30:15.959
PACEY, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT IS GOING ON?

30:15.959 --> 30:17.125
YOU KNOW WHAT I
ACTUALLY REALIZED

30:17.125 --> 30:19.959
WHEN I SAW THE TWO OF YOU
DANCING THERE TOGETHER?

30:19.959 --> 30:22.834
THAT IS THE HAPPIEST
I HAVE SEEN YOU
ALL NIGHT.

30:22.834 --> 30:24.291
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S
ACTUALLY THE HAPPIEST

30:24.291 --> 30:25.500
I'VE SEEN YOU IN WEEKS.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.458
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S WORSE THAN THAT?

30:27.458 --> 30:29.625
I DON'T CARE.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.583
I SAW THE TWO OF YOU
DANCING TOGETHER,

30:31.583 --> 30:33.625
AND I JUST DON'T CARE.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.792
I'M NOT ANGRY.

30:34.792 --> 30:35.708
I'M NOT JEALOUS.
I'M NOT UPSET.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.625
I'M REALLY
NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING.

30:37.625 --> 30:40.041
PACEY, FINE.
LET'S JUST TAKE THIS
NOTHING OUTSIDE.

30:40.041 --> 30:42.208
WHY--WHY BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO CLEAN UP
MY MESS AGAIN?

30:42.208 --> 30:44.500
NO. YOU WANTED ME
TO TAKE OFF
THE HAPPY MASK,

30:44.500 --> 30:45.333
AND THE HAPPY MASK
IS OFF.

30:45.333 --> 30:47.166
SO ANSWER ME
THIS ONE QUESTION

30:47.166 --> 30:47.750
BECAUSE THIS IS
WHAT I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO ASK YOU, JO.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.208
WHY ARE YOU WITH ME?

30:50.208 --> 30:51.166
PACEY.

30:51.166 --> 30:52.375
WHY ARE YOU WITH ME?

30:52.375 --> 30:54.250
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M STILL WITH YOU.

30:54.250 --> 30:55.917
I MEAN, I USED TO KNOW,
BUT I DON'T ANYMORE.

30:55.917 --> 30:57.000
I'LL MAKE
A NOTE OF THAT.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.417
WHAT I DO KNOW, JO,

30:58.417 --> 30:59.667
I FEEL LIKE
I'M JOSEPHINE POTTER'S

30:59.667 --> 31:01.166

31:01.166 --> 31:02.708
I FEEL LIKE
I'M THE DESIGNATED LOSER,

31:02.708 --> 31:03.834
THE FAIL--JUST BACK OFF!

31:03.834 --> 31:05.834
PACEY, I NEVER
SAID THAT,

31:05.834 --> 31:07.417
BUT THIS
ISN'T ABOUT ME.
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.000
NO, IT IS ABOUT YOU!

31:09.000 --> 31:10.834
IT'S ABOUT YOU  AND
HOW YOU  MAKE ME FEEL
WHEN I'M WITH YOU!

31:10.834 --> 31:13.834
OK? I FEEL LIKE I'M
STUPID AND I'M WORTHLESS
AND I'M NEVER RIGHT.

31:13.834 --> 31:16.166
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I REALIZE?
THAT IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

31:16.166 --> 31:17.542
THAT IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.000
BECAUSE I'M WITH YOU,
IT'S POOR PACEY.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
HE DIDN'T
GET INTO COLLEGE,

31:20.000 --> 31:21.291
AND IT'S STUPID PACEY
FORGOT THE LIMO

31:21.291 --> 31:23.041
AND RIPPED THE DRESS
AND MESSED UP THE CORSAGE.

31:23.041 --> 31:25.583
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.041
BUT I WANT YOU TO CARE!

31:27.041 --> 31:29.417
I WANT YOU TO CARE!

31:29.417 --> 31:31.250
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO JUST ACCEPT IT

31:31.250 --> 31:32.875
LIKE THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

31:32.875 --> 31:34.834
WE ARE NOT TRAPPED
ON THIS BOAT.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.708
YOU AND I ARE TRAPPED
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

31:36.708 --> 31:38.041
I CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE, JOEY.

31:38.041 --> 31:42.291
WHEN I'M WITH YOU,
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOTHING.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.333
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOTHING.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.583
THAT'S WHY I FLINCH
WHEN YOU COME TO TOUCH ME.

31:48.583 --> 31:49.458
IT'S WHY I NEVER TOUCH YOU.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.125
WHY I NEVER EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

31:51.125 --> 31:52.583
BECAUSE WHEN I START TO,

31:52.583 --> 31:55.917
IT JUST REMINDS ME
THAT I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

31:57.458 --> 31:58.875

31:58.875 --> 32:00.917
DONE?
OH, NO, I'M NOT DONE.

I AM JUST
GETTING STARTED.

32:02.917 --> 32:04.083

STOP RIGHT NOW.

NOT EVEN TRUE.

UNDERSTAND WHY HE
WOULD SAY ALL THAT

THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

BEEN TOO AFRAID
TO ADMIT IT,

40:26.250 --> 40:28.625
AHEM, YOU KNOW...

40:30.375 --> 40:35.875
OUR SENIOR YEAR
IS OVER NOW,

40:35.875 --> 40:39.417
AND YOU AND I ARE JUST
2 VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE

40:39.417 --> 40:41.917
ON 2 VERY DIFFERENT PATHS,

40:41.917 --> 40:43.667
AND FOR US THIS SUMMER
THERE IS NO BOAT,

40:43.667 --> 40:45.583
AND THERE IS NO SUNSET.

40:45.583 --> 40:48.542
THERE IS JUST
BOSTON AND CAPESIDE.

40:48.542 --> 40:50.708
BUT, PACEY, THEY'RE
LESS THAN AN HOUR APART.

40:50.708 --> 40:54.125
AND ARE MORE THAN A WORLD
APART, AND YOU KNOW IT.

40:55.583 --> 40:56.834
YOU'VE SPENT
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

40:56.834 --> 40:58.166
TRYING TO GET
OUT OF CAPESIDE, JOEY,

40:58.166 --> 41:01.041
BECAUSE YOU FELT
LIKE YOU DESERVED BETTER.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.125
WELL, I AM CAPESIDE.

41:04.333 --> 41:07.125
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
GET OUT AND YOU DID,

41:07.125 --> 41:09.417
AND YOU DO DESERVE BETTER.

41:09.417 --> 41:11.125
YOU DESERVE BETTER
THAN THIS PLACE,

41:11.125 --> 41:13.583
AND YOU DESERVE
BETTER THAN ME.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.625
YOU BREAK MY HEART
INTO A THOUSAND PIECES,

41:16.625 --> 41:18.583
AND YOU SAY IT'S BECAUSE
I DESERVE BETTER?

41:21.917 --> 41:23.125
JUST...

41:23.125 --> 41:27.917
LEAVE ME ALONE.

41:29.750 --> 41:30.959
OK.

42:28.708 --> 42:31.125
YOU KIDS WANT TO GO
TO THAT AFTER-PARTY?
