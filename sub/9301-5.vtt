WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:41.006 --> 01:42.166
Can I come out now?

01:42.908 --> 01:45.604
Queen Elmora,
You've outdone yourself.

01:45.877 --> 01:49.040
The strength of the shields and
weapons made from your Photanium...

01:49.347 --> 01:50.814
are without equal.

01:51.149 --> 01:52.980
Fortunately for me.

01:53.385 --> 01:56.213
It's always a pleasure to make this
trip here to the Moon of Phantos.

01:56.288 --> 01:58.085
and visit Your Highness.

01:58.490 --> 02:01.186
You may take your shipment of
Photanium, Man-At-Arms...

02:01.526 --> 02:02.959
as we have agreed.

02:03.395 --> 02:04.419
Now, leave me.

02:04.696 --> 02:08.496
Queen Elmora, forgive me,
but well, you seem different.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.568
Is something wrong?

02:09.568 --> 02:11.729
Everything is fine.

02:11.970 --> 02:13.335
We should go home now.

02:13.638 --> 02:17.699
King Randor appreciates your kindness
in giving us this fine metal.

02:18.043 --> 02:22.309
With it I'll be able to fashion it into
the strongest defence for Eternia.

02:30.021 --> 02:33.081
Yes, you have outdone yourself, Elmora.

02:35.093 --> 02:38.256
But little do they know,
their shipments of Photanium...

02:38.563 --> 02:39.996
will now be coming to me.

02:40.432 --> 02:44.664
What they are taking with
them is worthless metal ore.

02:45.103 --> 02:46.934
You've had you're way, Skeletor.

02:47.439 --> 02:51.000
Now release my men and leave Phantos.

02:51.343 --> 02:55.712
I don't think you understand, Elmora.
I'm in control here.

02:58.083 --> 03:03.350
Take them to the dungeons and
see they are made uncomfortable.

03:04.990 --> 03:07.151
How dare you!

03:08.693 --> 03:10.558
You'll have to do better than that, Elmora.

03:10.996 --> 03:15.365
The people of Phantos will not
bow to your evil, Skeletor.

03:22.407 --> 03:24.602
You will do my bidding.

03:25.844 --> 03:27.903
I will not!

03:35.987 --> 03:38.785
You will do my bidding!

03:40.225 --> 03:43.092
As you wish, Skeletor.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.903
I dunno what's so great
about that Photanium stuff.

03:53.171 --> 03:54.966
Everything they're made
from keeps breaking.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.238
Are you sure these weapons
are made out of Photanium?

03:58.610 --> 04:02.944
I'm positive. I made them myself from
the ore we brought back from Phantos.

04:03.315 --> 04:05.909
Okay, let's try it again.

04:09.955 --> 04:12.219
I think I'll go clean up my room.

04:14.159 --> 04:16.957
Wait a minute!  I'll help you.

04:17.796 --> 04:19.593
I can't understand it.

04:19.865 --> 04:23.665
This sure isn't the same Photanium
metal we tested on Phantos.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.526
Would Elmora try to cheat us?

04:25.770 --> 04:27.863
Well, she did act kinda
strange when we were there.

04:31.643 --> 04:32.735
The Falcon.

04:33.245 --> 04:35.338
We must go to Grayskull.

04:35.647 --> 04:39.083
I have something to talk to Adam
about, would you excuse us, please?

04:39.484 --> 04:42.920
Of course, father.
I'll get some help and clean up this mess.

04:44.656 --> 04:45.688
Let's go.

04:58.670 --> 05:03.369
Queen Elmora and Skeletor
have joined together.

05:03.608 --> 05:05.269
But Queen Elmora has
always been a friend.

05:05.644 --> 05:10.172
She is no longer a friend,
though it is against her will.

05:10.448 --> 05:11.574
How could that happen?

05:11.950 --> 05:16.721
Skeletor has cast a spell over
her and now controls her...

05:16.721 --> 05:18.348
and her planet Phantos.

05:18.623 --> 05:20.181
We've got to help her.

05:20.825 --> 05:22.884
By the power of Grayskull!

05:29.334 --> 05:32.997
I have the power!

05:47.018 --> 05:51.250
Beware of Elmora.
She will not see you as He-Man.

05:52.023 --> 05:54.184
Skeletor will see to that...

05:54.459 --> 05:57.394
though your spirit remains true.

05:57.696 --> 05:59.323
I will heed your warning.

05:59.564 --> 06:01.964
Come, my friends.
We must return to Phantos.

06:08.373 --> 06:11.900
Teela, we are leaving for Phantos.
You will remain with the palace guard.

06:12.143 --> 06:13.440
But can't I go?

06:13.778 --> 06:15.803
Let Prince Adam be in
charge of the guards.

06:16.147 --> 06:19.116
If we can find Adam. Please.

06:19.417 --> 06:20.916
No, there is no time to discuss it.

06:21.052 --> 06:23.179
We're meeting He-Man
and we're already late.

06:24.489 --> 06:26.286
I must go.

06:33.765 --> 06:35.232
To the space portals.

06:54.452 --> 06:55.516
This is the one.

07:51.876 --> 07:56.108
You must leave Phantos.
You are enemies of the realm!

07:56.648 --> 07:59.515
I don't know who you are,
but this is Elmora's realm...

07:59.818 --> 08:01.046
and we have come to help her.

08:01.453 --> 08:05.116
I am Elmora and I have
no need of your help.

08:05.490 --> 08:08.050
Leave, while i still let you!

08:08.359 --> 08:11.760
You, Elmora? This is Skeletor's doing.

08:17.068 --> 08:18.057
Battle Cat!

08:18.369 --> 08:20.599
Your Battle Cat is now my prisoner.

08:20.839 --> 08:24.468
Give up your folly, He-Man.
You can't defeat me.

08:24.742 --> 08:26.573
We're here to protect you, Elmora.

08:28.546 --> 08:32.448
Skeletor has given me all
the protection I need.

08:34.352 --> 08:38.880
Elmora, your magic is
evil now, but we will help you.

08:39.157 --> 08:42.354
We will free you and Phantos
inspite of Skeletor's wickedness.

09:10.221 --> 09:13.019
I thought you fellas
could use a little help.

09:15.627 --> 09:18.391
Teela, you've disobeyed my orders.

09:18.696 --> 09:19.590
But Father.

09:19.664 --> 09:22.827
You shouldn't have
disobeyed, Teela, but thank you.

09:24.002 --> 09:25.492
We'll discuss this later.

09:25.770 --> 09:28.500
Now Battle Cat and Stratos
are Elmora's prisoners.

09:28.773 --> 09:31.674
We've got to find a way to
break Skeletor's spell.

09:33.344 --> 09:37.178
Thats where the metal is refined
and Elmora's castle is just above.

09:40.151 --> 09:43.143
I know a way into Elmora's
castle through the refinery.

09:44.455 --> 09:45.615
Well, let's go.

09:45.924 --> 09:49.155
Not so fast, Teela.
We have to disguise ourselves first.

09:49.394 --> 09:50.394
C'mon.

09:50.562 --> 09:51.562
This way.

10:01.906 --> 10:05.398
Look at that. The slavedrivers push
the workers around with a force field.

10:06.110 --> 10:07.668
I'll put a stop to that.

10:08.179 --> 10:10.511
Patience, He-Man, all in good time.

10:23.795 --> 10:26.286
There's Mer-Man, one of Skeletor's crowd.

10:36.107 --> 10:37.597
Get over there, you lazy lout...

10:37.875 --> 10:40.901
or we'll seal ya in Photanium
body cells like those four.

11:04.936 --> 11:09.873
He-Man! What a prize
you'll make for Skeletor.

11:18.650 --> 11:19.650
He-Man!

11:21.519 --> 11:22.611
Gotcha!

11:44.042 --> 11:47.239
There are just too many of them to
fight, and besides...

11:47.679 --> 11:50.113
I knew you'd want to hear the good news.

11:50.548 --> 11:52.482
I got He-Man.

11:52.617 --> 11:54.642
Good work, how did you do it?

11:55.019 --> 11:58.079
I locked him into a Photanium body cell.

11:58.956 --> 12:00.583
He'll never get out.

12:01.192 --> 12:02.557
See for yourself.

12:07.231 --> 12:11.531
I tried freezing it, heating it,
chipping away at it. Nothing works.

12:11.803 --> 12:14.169
I've exhausted all my tricks too.

12:14.505 --> 12:16.871
Photanium is the strongest
metal in the universe.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.267
Good, good.

12:20.712 --> 12:25.308
The others will be no trouble to
us, with He-Man out of the way.

12:25.850 --> 12:30.617
Well, we better think of something fast.
They know we're here now.

12:30.922 --> 12:35.188
I guess the only thing to do is,
carry He-Man, back to Eternia.

12:38.830 --> 12:40.161
Now here's the plan.

12:40.531 --> 12:44.490
I should have known.
Nothing is stronger than He-Man.

12:44.836 --> 12:45.996
Whats next?

12:49.741 --> 12:53.233
While you and Lizard Man try
to find Battle Cat and Stratos...

12:53.478 --> 12:55.546
Teela and I will make our
way to Elmora's chambers.

12:56.047 --> 13:00.006
Remember, this is the castle of a
demon under the spell of Skeletor.

13:00.418 --> 13:01.851
So beware.

13:05.556 --> 13:09.458
So, they think they can
free, Elmora from my will.

13:10.495 --> 13:14.625
With He-Man out of the way, she's mine!

13:15.366 --> 13:17.197
Aren't you, my beauty?

13:18.202 --> 13:19.931
Never, Skeletor.

13:21.305 --> 13:24.502
My spell over Elmora
seems to be weakening.

13:24.976 --> 13:28.673
No matter.
I'm already in control of Phantos.

13:29.113 --> 13:33.447
Concentrate, Elmora. Find the answer.

13:49.133 --> 13:52.000
See if you can get out of
this one, He-Man.

14:00.077 --> 14:04.411
Your control over my
realm will be short lived.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.574
I'll show you whose realm this is.

14:09.053 --> 14:11.681
Strongarm, Mer-Man, take her.

14:17.528 --> 14:20.361
So you still think
you can defy me?

14:24.602 --> 14:26.900
Your strength is useless, Elmora.

14:30.308 --> 14:33.141
You don't have He-Man to save you now.

14:33.411 --> 14:37.074
As you can see,
your He-Man is permanently enshrined...

14:37.548 --> 14:40.108
in your own Photanium body cell.

14:40.485 --> 14:43.079
Don't be so sure.

14:49.060 --> 14:52.393
You'll have to deal with He-Man after all.

14:54.065 --> 14:57.193
No, you'll have to, my beauty.

14:57.602 --> 15:00.867
Your hatred of me will work in my favor.

15:01.272 --> 15:05.072
Every time you look at
He-Man, you'll see my face...

15:05.409 --> 15:08.276
and you'll think it is me.

15:14.685 --> 15:15.982
Come, you fools!

15:27.431 --> 15:31.561
They said you were tough,
but you're nothing but a big pussy cat.

15:34.205 --> 15:35.297
I think we found them.

15:35.306 --> 15:37.699
You take the one on the right,
I'll take the one on the left.

15:37.709 --> 15:38.709
No problem.

15:41.078 --> 15:46.141
I hate to leave you guys up in the air
like that, but we really got to go.

15:49.787 --> 15:53.223
I can't wait for her to see He-Man
and see what happens once she thinks...

15:54.025 --> 15:55.515
he is you.

15:56.627 --> 16:00.188
She hates me so much she'll tear him apart.

16:00.498 --> 16:03.899
And he probably won't even raise
a finger against her.

16:11.142 --> 16:12.234
Stay behind me.

16:12.510 --> 16:14.740
We no longer know what
to expect from Elmora.

16:15.012 --> 16:16.775
She's still under Skeletor's power.

16:27.959 --> 16:29.756
We're here as friends, Elmora.

16:34.765 --> 16:38.292
I've been waiting for you to
return, Skeletor.

16:38.769 --> 16:42.830
I hate you more, with every breath I take.

16:43.341 --> 16:45.566
Elmora, I don't know what
power Skeletor has over you...

16:45.610 --> 16:47.445
but I am He-Man, your friend.

16:47.445 --> 16:48.445
Not your enemy.

16:48.913 --> 16:53.373
I'm not blind.
I see you, and you are Skeletor.

16:53.751 --> 16:57.414
I must stop you any way I can.

17:07.198 --> 17:08.198
Teela!

17:08.733 --> 17:11.166
So, Skeletor's got you under his power too.

17:11.469 --> 17:13.493
Then I'll fight you both.

17:13.804 --> 17:17.535
I would never be Skeleton's ally.
Can't you see? This is He-Man.

17:17.942 --> 17:20.308
I see only Skeletor.

17:23.748 --> 17:24.748
Listen, Elmora.

17:24.915 --> 17:26.815
You are a queen of magic.

17:27.184 --> 17:29.697
And in magic, you know that what you see,

17:29.722 --> 17:32.111
is what the magician wants you to see.

17:33.457 --> 17:36.085
Come on, we'll take care of them ourselves.

17:36.661 --> 17:40.859
Elmora, your spirit is
stronger than Skeletor's spell.

17:44.835 --> 17:48.134
What evil is this? Two Skeletors?

17:48.472 --> 17:50.963
There is only one
Skeletor, Elmora.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.066
And he is the one.

17:53.611 --> 17:56.079
And together we'll rid ourselves of him.

17:56.514 --> 17:59.745
Elmora, don't be fooled
by Skeletor's spell.

18:00.051 --> 18:02.519
Enough!  I'll get you both!

18:13.230 --> 18:15.357
Remove your spell on Elmora!

18:15.633 --> 18:18.033
What?  Spoil all my fun?

18:19.904 --> 18:21.997
Now for a little more fun.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.131
There is your enemy, Elmora.

18:34.418 --> 18:37.444
What can I do? Which is He-Man?

18:37.755 --> 18:39.790
Remember your spin magic , Elmora.

18:39.790 --> 18:42.657
My spin magic.

18:48.132 --> 18:51.067
Yes, now I remember.

18:56.874 --> 19:00.571
Only He-Man can break out
of my Photanium chains.

19:02.913 --> 19:03.913
He-man!

19:04.315 --> 19:07.250
And you're the real Skeletor.

19:08.352 --> 19:10.843
Release Queen Elmora from
your spell...

19:11.055 --> 19:12.784
or you'll remain in these chains forever.

19:17.394 --> 19:20.295
He-Man, I can see you.

19:29.306 --> 19:32.275
There will be another day, He-Man!

19:37.348 --> 19:41.375
Phantos is once again under the reign
of our good friend, Queen Elmora.

19:41.652 --> 19:45.144
Long live the alliance
between Eternia and Phantos.

19:45.923 --> 19:51.987
Thank you, He-Man, for helping rid
Phantos from the evil grip of Skeletor.

19:52.329 --> 19:58.165
And Teela, thank you for making
me see the true power of magic.

20:02.506 --> 20:04.770
Peel all those potatoes.

20:05.075 --> 20:08.909
I hope this will teach the captain of
the guard that when an order is given...

20:09.280 --> 20:10.770
the order should be followed.

20:11.182 --> 20:13.343
Queen Elmora was glad I was there.

20:13.584 --> 20:15.413
I don't think I deserve
to be punished for it.

20:15.653 --> 20:18.781
Well if it's any consolation, Teela,
you're not being punished alone.

20:19.123 --> 20:21.853
We're all being punished for
your disobeying your father.

20:22.193 --> 20:24.991
I've... tasted your potatoes before.

20:33.471 --> 20:36.304
I'd like to talk to you for
just a moment about safety.

20:36.674 --> 20:38.677
When we go to the beach
there are lifeguards there

20:38.702 --> 20:40.259
to watch out for our safety.

20:40.611 --> 20:44.479
Crossing guards are in the street
for the same reason: to protect us.

20:44.849 --> 20:46.180
Now things like that are fine,

20:46.484 --> 20:49.920
but we can't count on someone
always being around to protect us.

20:50.254 --> 20:53.621
We should practice thinking
of safety all the time.

20:53.925 --> 20:55.085
So, don't take a chance.

20:55.426 --> 20:57.553
And that's true whether
you're crossing a street...

20:57.895 --> 20:58.987
or driving a car.

20:59.363 --> 21:00.591
Think safety.

21:01.305 --> 21:07.266
