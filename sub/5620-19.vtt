Oh, God.

We are good
at what we do, aren't we?

00:17.208 --> 00:18.834
That we are.

00:18.917 --> 00:19.875
If I had the energy, I would

00:19.959 --> 00:20.959
totally high five you right now.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.875
Ooh, yikes!
I missed 25 calls

00:22.959 --> 00:25.125
and 46 e-mails!

00:25.208 --> 00:26.583
I missed two Instagram likes

00:26.667 --> 00:28.667
and an e-mail
from Michelle Obama.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.875
"Dear Americans..."
Oh, this is serious.

00:30.959 --> 00:32.875
We have to get out of this bed
and get back to our lives.

00:32.959 --> 00:34.166
Yes, that we do.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.333
Is that your hand on my breast?

00:36.417 --> 00:37.959
Is that your breast

I can't believe you haven't
made one comment

00:48.959 --> 00:50.625
about what's in my basket.

00:50.709 --> 00:52.166
You notice anything unusual?

00:52.250 --> 00:54.458
Lady deodorant.

00:54.542 --> 00:55.917
Pink razors.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.917
Is this a hint?
Because in some countries,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.875
I'm too groomed.
No.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.750
I'm in a mature
relationship,

01:01.834 --> 01:03.250
so I'm maturely buying
chick crap

01:03.333 --> 01:05.041
for Catherine to leave
at my apartment.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.667
As opposed to the chick crap
that you use at your apartment?

01:07.750 --> 01:10.458
All right, make your
little jokes, Amy Schumer.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.959
Now, see, over the years,
women have wanted to leave

01:12.041 --> 01:14.709
stuff like this at my apartment,
I've resisted.
Oh.

01:14.792 --> 01:15.917
Catherine is different.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.542
And this gesture
is my way of showing her.

01:17.625 --> 01:18.917
No, you know what?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.917
I am very happy for you.
This is big.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.083
It almost justifies
you dragging me out here

01:23.166 --> 01:25.375
to brag about your progress.

01:25.458 --> 01:26.834
Someday when you're
in a relationship,

01:26.917 --> 01:28.333
you'll get to experience
all this, too.

01:28.417 --> 01:29.959
I am in a relationship.

01:30.041 --> 01:31.542
Remember Craig,
the musician?

01:31.625 --> 01:32.959
Craig, Cra...

01:33.041 --> 01:34.917
I get all those Hollywood
white guys mixed up.

01:35.000 --> 01:35.959
Oh, my...
That's the beauty
of Catherine.

01:36.041 --> 01:36.959
She's diverse.

01:37.041 --> 01:39.166
She looks like our country.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.959
Remind why I agreed
to help you.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.166
Oh, right, for
the free stuff.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.208
(gasps)
Ooh!

01:44.291 --> 01:46.208
Cough syrup with codeine.

01:46.291 --> 01:48.959
Or as I like to call it--
codeine with cough syrup.

01:49.041 --> 01:50.959
Are you allowed to-to
drink this in the store?

01:51.041 --> 01:52.166
Mm-hmm.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.166
I'll-I'll pay.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.959
And here we are.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.166
Yep.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.917
It took a woman
like Catherine Sanders

01:59.000 --> 02:03.083
to finally get Jimmy Martino
to buy his lady tampons.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.875
Do they sell guns here?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Which ones do you think
she'd like?

02:06.083 --> 02:07.542
Now, keep in mind she's a CEO,

02:07.625 --> 02:09.333
so money is no object.

02:09.417 --> 02:12.000
It's an important decision.
Could you draw me a picture

02:12.083 --> 02:14.125
of what her vagina looks like?
Which way does it lean?

02:14.208 --> 02:16.083
Well, left...

02:16.166 --> 02:18.041
My God, you're actually
trying to answer that.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.500
Oh, sorry.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.000
These are
for my girlfriend.

02:22.083 --> 02:24.458
Embarrassing, right?

02:24.542 --> 02:26.041
You hear that?
I just said "girlfriend."

02:26.125 --> 02:27.709
I suppose "boyfriend"
is gonna be next.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.000
Ah, see it was.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.250
Thank you.

02:31.333 --> 02:33.083
(groans)

02:36.542 --> 02:38.041
Edie, isn't this great?

02:38.125 --> 02:39.291
Now that Mommy and Daddy
are a couple,

02:39.375 --> 02:40.709
she can walk around naked.

02:40.792 --> 02:41.875
I'm wearing a towel.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.250
Yeah, but when you sat down...

02:43.333 --> 02:45.834
Never mind.

02:45.917 --> 02:47.542
Holy crap!
What the hell was that?

02:47.625 --> 02:49.709
I just sneezed.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.041
(high-pitched):
Achoo.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.959
Achoo!

02:53.041 --> 02:55.792
Oh, that's public
sneeze persona.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.709
I guess I'm just getting
comfortable around you.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.875
(chuckles)
You know what?

02:59.959 --> 03:01.583
I love this, you know?

03:01.667 --> 03:03.000
Even though we've known
each other for years,

03:03.083 --> 03:04.125
there's still so much we get

03:04.208 --> 03:05.542
to discover
about each other now.

03:05.625 --> 03:06.834
If you're saying
you want us to keep

03:06.917 --> 03:08.000
the door open
when we use the bathroom,

03:08.083 --> 03:09.250
I'm way ahead of you.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.583
Actually been waiting
for the right time

03:10.667 --> 03:11.625
to ask you to stop that.

03:11.709 --> 03:12.625
But you know what?

03:12.709 --> 03:14.041
There is one very important part

03:14.125 --> 03:15.834
of my life that you haven't
experienced yet.

03:15.917 --> 03:18.792
You having disposable income?
Hey-o!

03:18.875 --> 03:20.875
Just kidding.
We're equally poor.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.875
No, I'm talking
about Friday movie night.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.667
I've been doing it with my mom
ever since I was a kid,

03:24.750 --> 03:26.041
but I never brought
a girl to it.

03:26.125 --> 03:29.041
You're saying I can come
to movie night? Really?

03:29.125 --> 03:30.083
Hell yeah.
It's the best.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.917
It's a whole big tradition.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.583
And let's just say it ain't
your mama's movie night.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.000
Although it is
<i>my </i>mama's movie night.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.709
Cool.
Should I bring popcorn?

03:38.792 --> 03:40.834
Nah, just bring
your love of cinema

03:40.917 --> 03:42.166
and adventure.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.458
Popcorn, she says.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.208
Wait, you've never borrowed
money from an employee?

03:52.291 --> 03:53.250
Oh, it's the best.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.041
They can't say no.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.208
And they never have the
balls to ask for it back.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.500
That sounds absolutely awful.

03:58.583 --> 03:59.834
And I'm dying to try it.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.709
Watch this.
Annelise, can I borrow...?

04:01.792 --> 04:03.083
Not now, Jimmy, I'm busy.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.542
It's okay.
I know where her purse is.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.291
ANNELISE:
I'm moving it.

04:06.375 --> 04:07.917
Close your eyes.
I have something for you.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.125
Ooh, I hope you
didn't spend too much.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.125
And you didn't.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.750
Feminine products.

04:14.834 --> 04:17.125
Wow, well, you really know
how to spoil a girl.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.417
And I got you
a whole toiletry kit

04:18.500 --> 04:20.125
that you can keep
at my apartment--

04:20.208 --> 04:22.125
complete with
a Sonicare toothbrush,

04:22.208 --> 04:23.333
charging as we speak.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.333
That is really sweet.

04:25.417 --> 04:26.625
It's a little weird,

04:26.709 --> 04:28.208
but I love it.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.583
Mwah.
(phone rings)

04:31.667 --> 04:33.000
(groans)

04:33.083 --> 04:35.125
My sister is a
world-class nightmare.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.583
She was dropped
on her head

04:36.667 --> 04:39.000
once and it's her
excuse for everything.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.125
I'm sorry, I'm just
having a bad day.

04:41.208 --> 04:42.417
I know exactly
what you need.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.125
Stay right here, okay?

04:45.208 --> 04:47.500
Ravi, Catherine's
having a bad day.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.333
<i>Our </i>Catherine? What's wrong?
Is she okay?

04:49.417 --> 04:50.750
I don't know, but you're
gonna make it all better

04:50.834 --> 04:52.375
by making a killer plate

04:52.458 --> 04:54.375
of cavatelli alla norcina
with black truffles, stat.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.375
Oh, and everyone, I know I said

04:56.458 --> 04:58.166
the most important meal you
ever made was for Mark Wahlberg.

04:58.250 --> 04:59.583
Well, forget it.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.250
It's for my girlfriend.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.667
Okay, so listen,
I'm-I'm at dinner.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.125
I got to go.

05:05.208 --> 05:08.000
No, just some
guy I'm seeing.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.625
"Just some guy I'm seeing"?

05:14.750 --> 05:16.375
All right, people.
Prepare to be titillated.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.375
I want your opinion
on my love life.

05:17.458 --> 05:18.750
Oh, can it wait?

05:18.834 --> 05:20.375
Edie thinks she's
cooking spaghetti.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.709
It is literally the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.041
No, it can't wait.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.083
Oh, that is
the cutest little thing.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.667
Bam!
Bam!
Thank you.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.041
All right, Gerald,
get her out of here.

05:28.125 --> 05:29.375
We have important things
to talk about.

05:29.458 --> 05:30.709
Okay, people, give us a minute.

05:30.792 --> 05:32.667
Inner circle stuff.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.917
Okay, maybe we can
just get rid of one of them.

05:34.041 --> 05:34.959
(whispers):
Doesn't matter who.

05:35.041 --> 05:36.542
All right, so this is

05:36.625 --> 05:38.291
about my girlfriend Catherine.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.291
Wow, "girlfriend."

05:39.375 --> 05:40.417
Did you hear that, Edie?

05:40.500 --> 05:41.500
Not only did he
say "girlfriend,"

05:41.583 --> 05:42.917
but he said it casually.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.417
Don't alert
the tabloids yet, Edie.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.750
Okay.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.000
Last night,
she referred to me as

05:47.083 --> 05:48.500
"just some guy she's seeing."

05:48.583 --> 05:50.000
Why doesn't she see me
as her boyfriend?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.417
I mean, I give her gifts.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.291
We have a one-to-one
orgasm ratio.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.208
Dad, stop.
Did you ever consider

05:55.291 --> 05:57.417
that perhaps you don't see
yourself as a boyfriend?

05:57.500 --> 05:59.000
Gerald, I don't have time

05:59.083 --> 06:00.375
for your Chinese philosophy.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.083
Maybe she's dating
someone better?

06:02.166 --> 06:04.250
Like who, Victor-- God?

06:04.333 --> 06:06.875
Or maybe she's aware
of your reputation.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.166
Pillar of the community?

06:08.250 --> 06:09.750
Lovable man slut
of the community.

06:09.834 --> 06:12.417
Remember what comes up when
you make me Google you?

06:12.500 --> 06:15.458
Dozens of Getty
Image photos of you

06:15.542 --> 06:18.041
and young gorgeous women.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.583
Maybe that's making her afraid
to get serious with you.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.417
You know what?
You're right.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.458
Yeah, maybe Catherine
thinks of me as a playboy.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.583
That I'm too good for her.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.333
I didn't say that last thing.

06:28.417 --> 06:30.583
I know the one thing
that'll fix this.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.333
You go online and replace
every woman

06:32.417 --> 06:34.583
in a photo with you
with a really handsome guy.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.208
No, no, Victor, don't do that.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.458
Seriously, I'll be
very mad if you do that.

06:38.542 --> 06:39.792
You know, honestly
if I were you, I would...

06:39.875 --> 06:41.709
Gerald, before you
finish that sentence,

06:41.792 --> 06:43.834
I want you to stop
and honestly ask yourself,

06:43.917 --> 06:46.709
"Does this have anything to do
with Chinese philosophy?"

06:46.792 --> 06:48.125
It doesn't.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.083
But I think you might
think it does.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.750
So... we're gonna go.

06:52.834 --> 06:54.458
Say "peace out, Grandpa."

06:54.542 --> 06:55.750
Peace out, Dampa.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.792
Once again, Annelise is right.

06:58.875 --> 07:00.709
Catherine thinks of me
as a player.

07:00.792 --> 07:02.917
I'm gonna have to double down
on this boyfriend stuff.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.417
Make her think
I'm in for the long haul,

07:04.500 --> 07:07.417
and you know what?
I know just what to do.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.500
That's my boss.

07:08.583 --> 07:11.166

07:11.250 --> 07:12.458

07:38.542 --> 07:40.000
that's actually more fun
than the movie.

07:40.083 --> 07:43.000
Unless we go with
my first pick,<i> Capote. </i>

07:43.083 --> 07:44.166
Veto.
Reverse veto.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.041
Danny DeVito.

07:45.125 --> 07:45.834
That's well played.

07:45.917 --> 07:48.083
Um... okay.

07:48.166 --> 07:51.041
This is... different.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.333
All right.
So it's your turn, babe.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.542
Now do you want
to make a pick or do you

07:53.625 --> 07:54.875
want to pass
and bank one of your vetoes?

07:54.959 --> 07:56.458
VANESSA:
Hmm...

07:56.542 --> 07:58.875
I'd go with...

07:58.959 --> 08:00.166
<i>Happy Gilmore.</i>

08:00.250 --> 08:01.750
That's a great idea!

08:01.834 --> 08:04.291
If it hadn't been
Veto Corleone'd last week.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.625
Yeah.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.375
Well, it's a long story.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.625
But a great one. See...

08:08.709 --> 08:09.750
I'll get it from context.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.458
It's Mama's turn.

08:11.542 --> 08:12.959
What about...

08:13.041 --> 08:15.709
<i>The Love Guru?</i>

08:15.792 --> 08:17.834
You're just trying
to burn one of my vetoes.

08:17.917 --> 08:20.583
No, I want to watch
<i>The Love Guru.</i>

08:20.667 --> 08:22.083
All right.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.125
Let's watch
the famously-hated movie

08:24.208 --> 08:25.750
that we only own because it was

08:25.834 --> 08:28.166
in the DVD player
we bought off Craigslist.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.500
Veto.

08:30.583 --> 08:31.583
(laughs)

08:31.667 --> 08:33.417
All right.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.959
Not that this parliamentary
exercise is not a blast,

08:36.041 --> 08:38.333
but we are going to watch
a movie tonight, right?

08:38.417 --> 08:39.583
I don't know.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.709
Maybe we should ask,

08:40.792 --> 08:43.125
uh,<i> Forrest Gump. </i>

08:43.208 --> 08:44.959
Ah! Can't watch it
for the next five years.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.291
My plan all along!

08:47.375 --> 08:49.291
Oh! All right.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.667
I could use one of
my ricochets...

08:51.750 --> 08:53.583
but I've only
got 90 left.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.083
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

08:55.166 --> 08:56.583
Oh, don't act like
you like romcoms.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.208
SARA:
Ah ha ha ha!

08:58.291 --> 08:59.792
You don't know
what I'm gonna do!

08:59.875 --> 09:01.625
(doorbells rings)

09:01.709 --> 09:03.375
Coming!

09:05.333 --> 09:07.917
Ooh, sexy.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.458
Business on the outside,

09:09.542 --> 09:10.792
naked body underneath.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.625
Yes, that is how
clothing works.

09:14.083 --> 09:16.125
So, I got the twist-off kind

09:16.208 --> 09:17.917
so I could drink
while I waited in line to pay.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.250
Okay.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.625
My sister...
Uh-huh.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.250
...has now somehow
turned my folks against me.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.625
I mean, I gave her a job.

09:24.709 --> 09:26.291
Mm.

09:26.375 --> 09:27.625
Yeah, hold that thought,

09:27.709 --> 09:29.125
because I have
a special treat for you.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.917
Oh. Well, is it another
bottle of wine?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.792
Because this one
is almost empty.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.083
No, better than that.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.417
And it's so messed up,

09:35.500 --> 09:37.000
because my sister works for me.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.500
Well, she did work for me,
until just recently...

09:39.583 --> 09:41.291
May I present...

09:41.375 --> 09:43.250
Marv, my doorman.
Marv, Catherine;

09:43.333 --> 09:44.333
Catherine, Marv.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.709
We met downstairs

09:45.792 --> 09:47.333
when you were calling
your sister a whore.

09:47.417 --> 09:48.667
Mm.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.500
Yes. Nice to meet you.
Again.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.667
Now, Marv, you've known me
for a while and, uh,

09:53.750 --> 09:55.583
you've seen me date a number
of women, have you not?

09:55.667 --> 09:56.667
Mm-hmm.
All sorts of women.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.500
Blondes, brunettes;

09:58.583 --> 10:00.834
25-year-olds,
28-year-olds;

10:00.917 --> 10:02.125
twins, triplets...

10:02.208 --> 10:03.125
JIMMY:
Right, right, right.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.667
And what is the one thing

10:04.750 --> 10:06.500
that none of 'em had?

10:06.583 --> 10:07.834
Marv.

10:07.917 --> 10:10.709
No. No, walk-in privileges
to my apartment.

10:10.792 --> 10:11.667
Right? So, Marv,

10:11.750 --> 10:13.333
as my witness,

10:13.417 --> 10:15.291
I hereby give Catherine Sanders

10:15.375 --> 10:16.834
permission to come and go
at her leisure.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.917
No signing in, no buzzing up.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.333
That is against
leasing company policy.

10:21.417 --> 10:22.667
Right. Thanks, Marv.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.709
So, what do you think, huh?

10:23.792 --> 10:25.208
Are you surprised?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.542
It's really
not necessary, Jimmy.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.125
I can just get buzzed up
the normal way.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.000
That would be a lot better
for me, leasing company-wise.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.208
Uh, thanks, Marv.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.000
Wait a minute.
I don't, I don't understand.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.792
I don't see how you're not
jumping for joy over this.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.875
I'm giving you the keys
to this castle.

10:36.959 --> 10:39.333
It's a privilege that I didn't
even extend to Lucy Liu...

10:39.417 --> 10:41.333
and yes, this is my subtle way
of telling you I dated Lucy Liu.

10:41.417 --> 10:43.333
You are acting
like a child, Jimmy,

10:43.417 --> 10:44.709
and if you haven't noticed,

10:44.792 --> 10:46.709
I am already dealing
with one of those today.

10:46.792 --> 10:48.291
What are you talking about?

10:48.375 --> 10:50.250
Oh, my God,
you really don't know.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.959
Why don't we just
get this out in the open?

10:53.041 --> 10:54.875
You don't think
I'm boyfriend material, do you?

10:54.959 --> 10:57.250
Are you?
Yes.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.458
How does Marv not prove that?

10:59.542 --> 11:01.000
Carting out your doorman?

11:01.083 --> 11:03.250
You are unbelievable, Jimmy.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.959
Yeah, and you're unappreciative.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.875
You know how many women in this
town would love this privilege?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.250
Then call them.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.083
Oh!
Shh!

11:10.166 --> 11:11.792
(phone ringing, groans)

11:11.875 --> 11:13.792
And it's my sister,
for the billionth time.

11:13.875 --> 11:16.500
(sighs)
You know what? I have to go.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.000
Hey, Marv.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.750
(ringing continues)

11:19.834 --> 11:21.792
Maybe you could just
put Catherine's name

11:21.875 --> 11:23.792
down on the sublease
so it'll all work out...

11:23.875 --> 11:25.291
(drumroll)

11:25.375 --> 11:27.083
(trumpeting)

11:27.166 --> 11:28.458
GERALD:
All right.

11:28.542 --> 11:30.291
It was a long process,
but once again,

11:30.375 --> 11:31.917
the system has prevailed.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.333
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:33.417 --> 11:34.667
<i>Regarding Henry.</i>

11:34.750 --> 11:35.875
VANESSA:
I don't get it.

11:35.959 --> 11:37.792
Does anybody even
want to see this movie?

11:37.875 --> 11:39.083
No.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.750
But that's movie night.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.458
I think it's getting
kind of late.

11:42.542 --> 11:44.417
And even if it weren't,

11:44.500 --> 11:46.000
I think I'm gonna hit the hay.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.625
Nah. Are you sure?

11:47.709 --> 11:49.583
Very sure.
Good night.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.333
(sighs)

11:52.417 --> 11:53.834
Tonight was about showing

11:53.917 --> 11:56.041
this tradition that
I love to Vanessa

11:56.125 --> 11:57.583
and she hated it.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.583
What does that mean?

11:59.667 --> 12:01.792
Are we just... incompatible?

12:01.875 --> 12:04.625
Hey, movie night
ain't for everyone.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.166
But good news,
now that she's gone,

12:06.250 --> 12:07.917
<i>Patriot Games</i>
is back on the table.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.291
Hah!

12:15.750 --> 12:17.792
Far be it from me
to question you,

12:17.875 --> 12:20.792
but why are you restocking
the oral hygiene aisle?

12:20.875 --> 12:22.417
I'm returning all the things
I bought for Catherine.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.834
We're done.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.250
Okay, but you know
you can't return items

12:25.333 --> 12:26.792
just by putting them
back the shelf.

12:26.875 --> 12:27.834
Well, how else
do you do it?

12:27.917 --> 12:28.834
Annelise usually
does it for me.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.041
You have to wait in line,

12:30.125 --> 12:31.500
talk to the manager,

12:31.583 --> 12:33.041
show them the receipt,
give them the credit...

12:33.125 --> 12:34.125
I'm not doing all that.

12:35.792 --> 12:38.166
So why are you
and Catherine done?

12:38.250 --> 12:39.625
Got in a fight.

12:39.709 --> 12:41.208
And she said
she wanted to break up?

12:41.291 --> 12:42.959
Well, not in so many words,

12:43.041 --> 12:44.500
but that's usually
what happens with me.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.250
We get in a fight, we break up
and we never talk again.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.291
Every relationship has fights.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.166
Craig and I once had
a huge yelling fight

12:50.250 --> 12:51.917
over whether or not Tori

12:52.000 --> 12:53.041
was on<i> The Bachelor </i>
for the right reasons.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.291
Well, she wasn't, clearly.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.333
Right?
Right?

12:55.417 --> 12:56.917
Anyway, after I gave him

12:57.000 --> 12:58.166
the silent treatment
for a couple of hours,

12:58.250 --> 12:59.917
we came together like adults,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
apologized, had crazy sex,
and moved on.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.166
Tell me what
your fight was about.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.041
I don't know.
She came over last night

13:07.125 --> 13:08.542
and she got all worked up
about her sister or something.

13:08.625 --> 13:09.750
But then I did
this great thing.

13:09.834 --> 13:11.333
I had the doorman come in

13:11.417 --> 13:13.083
and give her walk-in privileges.

13:13.166 --> 13:15.375
Sort of a baller twist
on giving her my house key.

13:15.458 --> 13:16.959
Wouldn't her name have
to be on the sublease?

13:17.041 --> 13:18.083
Yeah, I know.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.959
But the point is
that she got worked up,

13:20.041 --> 13:21.291
she left and she said
I wasn't boyfriend material.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.041
Well, what was the thing
with the sister?

13:24.208 --> 13:26.083
Ah... ding, ding, ding.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.709
So it sounds like Catherine
was having a personal problem

13:28.792 --> 13:30.709
and she could've used
a little emotional support.

13:30.792 --> 13:33.500
You know, the kind boyfriends
tend to give their girlfriends.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.083
You think so?
Yes.

13:35.166 --> 13:36.959
But I'm only
a board-certified therapist

13:37.041 --> 13:38.166
who's always right.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.500
You don't think
she moved on already?

13:39.583 --> 13:41.208
(laughs)
It's been eight hours.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.625
I would've moved on already.

13:42.709 --> 13:45.500
Go talk to her.
I bet she's in her sweats

13:45.583 --> 13:47.625
eating a pint of cookie dough
ice cream. Oh, by the way,

13:47.709 --> 13:49.166
you're buying me a pint
of cookie dough ice cream.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.667
What are you doing?

13:50.750 --> 13:51.834
I'm not passing up free tampons.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.000
And these are the good ones.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.125
Oh, yeah, they are.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.208
None of the blue
liquid gets through.

13:55.291 --> 13:57.291
Well, it doesn't.

13:57.375 --> 13:59.125
MAN:<i> Yes! Yes! </i>

13:59.208 --> 14:01.417
Rip his junk off and use
it as a puppet, Roy!

14:01.500 --> 14:03.542
It's so violent.
Hey.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.125
Thanks for letting
us watch MMA here.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.125
Hey, that's what couples
do for each other.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.834
Yeah.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.125
but I'm excited to find

14:10.208 --> 14:11.291
something else
we can do together, yeah?

14:11.375 --> 14:13.125
Maybe it's mixed
martial arts.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.208
Mm.

14:14.291 --> 14:15.667
(grunts)
Make him hemorrhage!

14:15.750 --> 14:17.125
Make him die in his 40s!

14:17.208 --> 14:19.542
Uh, is that allowed?

14:19.625 --> 14:22.125
I love it when they cut to a
shot of his family watching.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.041
Hey, you know what,
I mean, I feel a little weird

14:24.125 --> 14:25.625
admitting this,
and I'm not hoping for it,

14:25.709 --> 14:27.625
but if one of them dies,
it would be pretty exciting.

14:27.709 --> 14:31.125
Hey, you actually
enjoy this, baby?

14:31.208 --> 14:32.458
Yeah, I think I do.

14:32.542 --> 14:33.959
I mean, you know
I love pro wrestling,

14:34.041 --> 14:35.792
and I love those live
surgeries on Discovery.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.750
It's kind of like
the best of both worlds.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.166
All right, everyone,
place your bets.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.959
Shanahan versus Wong.

14:41.041 --> 14:43.166
(grunts)
You in, G?

14:43.250 --> 14:46.166
Uh, I mean, I haven't, uh,
placed a bet in a while.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.333
Not long enough
to forget the thrill.

14:48.417 --> 14:51.041
Oh, my God, do you have
a gambling problem?

14:51.125 --> 14:52.333
(laughing):
No.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.166
No. Just a little online poker.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.250
Oh.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.041
Women's college basketball,

14:57.125 --> 14:58.625
which, if you watch preseason,
is basically free money.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.000
Yo, my man,
Money Mike.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.166
Uh, what's the max wager?

15:01.250 --> 15:02.875
You know what,
don't answer that.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.542
Hey, I'm gonna get out of here.
Why don't you hide that?

15:04.625 --> 15:05.625
That's probably best for me.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.166
Hey, what time
is the main event?

15:07.250 --> 15:08.250
Uh, don't
answer that.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.583
Hi, Jimmy.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.375
Hi. I just came by to tell you

15:21.458 --> 15:22.875
that I borrowed
20 bucks from Ravi,

15:22.959 --> 15:25.041
and I have no intention
of ever paying him back.

15:26.417 --> 15:27.875
Catherine, you're amazing.

15:27.959 --> 15:29.875
And I really like you,
and I know I was an idiot.

15:29.959 --> 15:31.875
And, I'll tell you,
if you were anyone else,

15:31.959 --> 15:35.583
I-I would have moved on by now,
but I don't want to.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.583
And I don't think
you want to either.

15:39.667 --> 15:41.583
Everything okay?

15:41.667 --> 15:44.125
Or is this Ken doll
giving you a problem?

15:49.792 --> 15:52.417
This is weird.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.709
I guess so.
It's just that

15:53.792 --> 15:56.000
usually when I have
a big fight with a guy,

15:56.083 --> 15:58.375
that's how it goes.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.208
Sounds like the beginning
of a beautiful threesome.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.208
Listen, Rick,

16:01.291 --> 16:02.750
I know I invited
you here,

16:02.834 --> 16:04.250
but get out.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.500
We haven't even
had sex yet.

16:05.583 --> 16:06.875
I just inhaled
a pint of ice cream.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.875
That really wasn't
gonna happen anyway.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.834
I left my brother's
graduation for this?

16:11.542 --> 16:13.041
I'm, um...

16:13.125 --> 16:15.041
I'm gonna choose
to ignore all that.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.375
He's an old friend.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.917
Yours is bigger.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.166
That's all I needed to hear.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.709
Listen, I don't know what's
going on with your sister,

16:24.792 --> 16:26.000
and that's a problem.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.500
I mean, you needed
me to listen.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.291
That seems like a
very reasonable thing

16:29.375 --> 16:32.000
to expect from a guy who wants
to be called your boyfriend.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.667
Well, it's also
pretty reasonable

16:33.750 --> 16:35.667
that if a girl wants a guy
to help, she should ask.

16:35.750 --> 16:39.000
I did feel this was
mostly your fault.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.250
For two very successful people,

16:41.333 --> 16:44.041
we are idiots
when it comes to relationships.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.083
And what do we do now?

16:45.166 --> 16:46.625
Kissing couldn't hurt.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.625
Oh.

16:48.709 --> 16:50.291
You know what?

16:50.375 --> 16:52.500
I think we should
wait on that.

16:52.583 --> 16:54.792
Did the horny guy who just left
kill the mood?

16:54.875 --> 16:56.709
No, no. It's just
that I think that

16:56.792 --> 16:59.917
what a boyfriend and girlfriend
are supposed to do now is cook

17:00.000 --> 17:02.041
and sit on the couch and
talk and listen to ea...

17:02.125 --> 17:05.875
Yeah. Well, the horny guy
did sort of kill it, too.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.917
Come on. Now, tell me
about this horrible
sister of yours.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.917
(knocking)

17:11.000 --> 17:14.125
Ooh. Baby, you can't have that.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.875
Baby, you can't have that.

17:20.792 --> 17:22.083
EDIE:
My beer.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.667
Hey, Vanessa, we need
to talk about something.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.709
Your laptop was broken
before my cousins got here.

17:26.792 --> 17:29.041
Fine. Money Mike broke it.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.834
<i>Fine. </i>I broke it.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.333
It's okay.
I got it all backed up

17:32.417 --> 17:33.834
on my external hard drive.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.750
(hissing inhale)
Money Mike broke that.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.583
Fine. I broke that, too.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.500
Let's... talk about that later.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.375
Look... Vanessa,
I'm-I'm worried about us.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.834
You know? I mean,
you didn't like my thing,

17:44.917 --> 17:47.333
and I literally
can't do your thing<i> ever. </i>

17:47.417 --> 17:49.333
We're two very different people.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.792
Since when's that news?

17:51.875 --> 17:53.291
I know, but it's just...

17:53.375 --> 17:54.834
what's our relationship
gonna look like

17:54.917 --> 17:56.166
if we can't do anything
together?

17:56.250 --> 17:57.709
How will that work?

17:57.792 --> 18:00.166
It just will.

18:01.709 --> 18:03.166
Why aren't you worried
about this?

18:03.250 --> 18:07.166
Gerald, nothing
about you and me should work.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.125
Not helping.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.208
We got pregnant
when we weren't even dating,

18:11.291 --> 18:13.250
we both still live
with our families,

18:13.333 --> 18:15.166
my grandmother
hates white people.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.166
Since when do we
care about that stuff?

18:18.250 --> 18:20.000
I love you.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.750
Even during movie
night, I loved you.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.333
I love you, too.

18:24.417 --> 18:27.125
And we're still getting
to know each other, right?

18:27.208 --> 18:29.333
We'll figure out tons of stuff
to do together.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.834
Like, um...
do you like mini golf?

18:31.917 --> 18:33.834
No. Do you like gun ranges?

18:33.917 --> 18:35.792
No. Do you like road trips?

18:35.875 --> 18:37.792
No. Do you like just shooting
guns in the desert?

18:37.875 --> 18:40.208
No.
Oh.
Do you like...?

18:40.291 --> 18:41.792
Kissing?
Yes.

18:43.792 --> 18:44.792
My beer.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.000
So, I caught my sister
looking at porn at work.
Oh.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.750
And-and I told her
to stop, and she said no,

18:51.375 --> 18:52.500
so I had to fire her.
Hmm.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.166
I mean, filthy stuff.

18:54.291 --> 18:55.917
Genres that I didn't
even know existed.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.959
Really? Good thing
I don't work for you.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.208
(laughs)
I'm just kidding.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.041
I've got my own little
porn star right here.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.667
Is that a romantic,
boyfriendy thing to say?

19:03.792 --> 19:05.125
Uh-uh, not really.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.041
(loud, indistinct chatter on TV)

19:06.125 --> 19:08.875
Oh, want to watch
<i>The Bachelorette? </i>It's 8:00.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.583
I dated her for
a hot minute.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.583
Oh, she's cute.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.083
Ooh, big Bill
O'Reilly, huh?

19:14.166 --> 19:17.166
How about<i> The </i>
<i>O'Reilly Factor?</i>

19:17.250 --> 19:18.500
Oh, no, you did not.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.250
He was liberal in bed.

19:20.458 --> 19:21.750
I love that
we're both funny.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.375
(doorbell rings)

19:24.709 --> 19:26.583
Been there.
Wait. No.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.709
Coming!

19:35.291 --> 19:37.500
Jimmy, this is
my security guard Brent.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.250
Brent, this is Jimmy,

19:40.041 --> 19:41.333
my boyfriend.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.333
No need to buzz him up
from the gate.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.000
He can drive on
whenever he wants.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.125
Thank you.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.208
You know, when I say we should
just cuddle and talk,

19:54.291 --> 19:56.291
I completely forgot
about make-up sex.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.333
Oh, right! It
slipped my mind, too.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.583
Did you really sleep
with Bill O'Reilly?

20:06.166 --> 20:07.500
Yours is bigger.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.709
Ah. All I needed to hear.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.000
(laughing)
