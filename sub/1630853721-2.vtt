WEBVTT

01:15.909 --> 01:17.702
-Keep her alive.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.137
Yo, Jade!

01:36.930 --> 01:39.724
We stop shooting, you're dead.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.684
So how about you just come with us, huh?

01:42.477 --> 01:43.478
Come on.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.606
Sometimes, it's better
to eff the devil, you know, right?

02:17.095 --> 02:18.054
Stop! Please!

02:33.027 --> 02:34.863
-Drive!

03:26.831 --> 03:30.543
-Hey! Hey!

03:30.627 --> 03:33.171
Are you okay? Hey! Are you okay?

03:33.254 --> 03:35.506
Are you okay?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.635
Are you okay?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.929
-I'm okay.
-Are you…

03:41.012 --> 03:42.847
I don't think I'm a dog person anymore.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.225
-Well, that's okay.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.392
It's okay.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.603
Ow!

03:48.686 --> 03:49.938
You need a doctor, okay?

03:50.730 --> 03:51.689
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.358
Now I'm gonna get…

03:53.441 --> 03:55.235
It might hurt a little bit. Okay, ready?

03:55.318 --> 03:57.195
-Careful.
-One, two, three.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.530
-Okay.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.199
I need… I need help.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.243
I know. And we're gonna get you help.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.675
It's okay.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.518
-I'm sorry. I…

04:30.853 --> 04:32.397
It's gonna be all right.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.527
Dad.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.861
Did the dog bite her?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.238
Yeah.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.490
Jesus.

04:49.497 --> 04:53.376
-Is she, is she gonna be okay?
-Billie, look at me. Look at me.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.505
She's in shock.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.302
Hey, Bill?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.562
You're going to have to take her home.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.605
-What?
-Keep pressure on the wound.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.566
Her vitals are fine.
No major arteries were hit.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.692
Are you fucking…

05:18.359 --> 05:19.610
She needs a hospital.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.654
Just go before Umbrella sees you.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.240
Okay.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.576
No. Not okay.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.787
At the end of the hall, the door is open.
Cut through the backfield.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.748
-But why?
-Now!

05:32.915 --> 05:33.833
Jade.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.210
Okay, okay.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.671
-Jade.
-Come on.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.424
Come on, come on.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.884
That's it.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.534
Stop!

06:54.455 --> 06:55.540
Hey!

06:59.961 --> 07:01.671
No. Wait, wait! Stop!

07:01.754 --> 07:03.756
Wait! Wait! No!

07:03.840 --> 07:07.135
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please!

07:07.218 --> 07:08.928
Please! Stop!

07:23.484 --> 07:25.445
-Move!

07:25.528 --> 07:27.029
-Move!
-Oh, my God.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.907
I got you out of there.
Now get the fuck away from me!

07:29.991 --> 07:31.284
Umbrella's after you.

07:31.367 --> 07:34.162
You got a big fucking target on your back,
and I don't want one on mine.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.079
It's too late.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.874
What, you think
they're just gonna let you go?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.125
Run off and tell people that…

07:39.208 --> 07:40.835
That they shot up a freehold?

07:41.752 --> 07:42.879
No chance.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.630
They will hunt you down.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.259
But I can help you. Okay?

07:48.342 --> 07:50.678
I can get you away from Umbrella.
I save you, you save me.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.976
Okay, good.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.291
No.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.252
No!

08:27.256 --> 08:28.716
Grab my hand!

08:28.799 --> 08:29.926
Grab on!

09:09.048 --> 09:10.758
Move! Move, move, move!

09:10.841 --> 09:13.135
-Coming.
-I need a probe, searching team.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.720
Go out through the back door.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.894
-Right there.
-Contact, forward. In the back.

09:21.978 --> 09:22.812
Contact!

09:22.895 --> 09:24.272
We see your hands!

09:24.355 --> 09:25.398
Don't move!

09:26.649 --> 09:28.818
My, my name's Albert Wesker. I work here.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.611
There's been an incident.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.740
We should have waited
for an ambulance.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.909
-No. Dad…
-Dad…

09:36.993 --> 09:39.120
-Dad said…
-Fuck Dad.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.540
What do you think was wrong with that dog?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.874
I don't know.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.502
-It looked dead.
-Yeah, well…

09:46.586 --> 09:48.879
You looked dead too, Billie. I thought…

09:52.466 --> 09:54.468
I should have stopped you from going.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.095
-What?

09:56.178 --> 09:57.847
It just hurts.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.017
Where is Dad?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.901
One minute, things were fine,
and the next…

10:11.485 --> 10:13.904
every screen in the place went red
and all hell broke loose.

10:15.990 --> 10:16.907
Marcus.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.244
Evelyn Marcus. I run this fucking company.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.038
-Ma'am, without a badge, I--
-Move!

10:25.124 --> 10:26.208
Clear the room.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.048
Evelyn?

10:33.382 --> 10:34.425
How bad is it?

10:35.217 --> 10:37.511
I wasn't bitten. It's not my blood.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.890
Fire that guard.

10:40.973 --> 10:41.974
He's new.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.352
He's gone.

10:48.689 --> 10:49.690
What happened?

10:50.691 --> 10:51.692
We got hacked.

10:52.234 --> 10:55.655
I was working late when the whole system
went down and the virus…

10:55.738 --> 10:57.365
It must have overridden our security.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.575
The cage unlocked, the dog got out.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.500
Whoever did this
wiped every hard drive on campus.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.879
Research, security cameras, everything.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.216
We have backups of the research.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.759
Still a pain in my ass.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.095
An attack like this,
usually, it's ransomware,

11:19.178 --> 11:21.430
but this was just burn it all down.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.265
Why?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.519
I thought you were in Tokyo now.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.312
I split time.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.148
When I got the call,
I was already on my way here.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.400
Thanks to you.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.484
Joy?

11:36.737 --> 11:39.532
I'm right about this, Evelyn.
The drug has side effects.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.117
-Minor side effects.
-"Minor"?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.703
Did you see the fucking monster
in the lobby?

11:43.786 --> 11:46.122
So we fix it. We make it better.

11:50.334 --> 11:54.171
What happened in Tijuana,
we're taking it seriously.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.050
That's why I'm moving
the Joy production line here,

11:58.134 --> 11:59.427
so I can keep an eye on it.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.095
And, you know, tax breaks.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.264
Al…

12:05.683 --> 12:06.934
You and me.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.937
We're gonna drive this one home.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.648
Just like the old days.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.359
I'm tired.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.155
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

12:22.366 --> 12:23.576
Sure.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.132
Ev! Oh, thank God.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.633
What are you doing here?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.761
I heard the sirens,
and you weren't answering your phone.

12:44.013 --> 12:48.225
Diana, this is Albert Wesker,
one of my scientists.

12:49.059 --> 12:52.146
Albert, my wife, Diana.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.856
What happened? Was there a break-in?

12:54.523 --> 12:55.983
It's being handled.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.276
What does that mean?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.990
-Diana, you know I can't talk about work--
-No.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.367
I'm not one of your employees.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.369
You've been gone for weeks,

13:07.453 --> 13:09.622
and I have to hear from your assistant
that you're back.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.458
You drag us
around the world for this job.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.627
Then we might as well leave.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.172
-You don't care.
-No, Diana.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.347
I should go.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.855
Al?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.737
Say hi to the girls for me.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.206
-What?

13:54.250 --> 13:57.294
-Billie? Billie?

14:00.881 --> 14:02.466
-Where were you?

14:03.467 --> 14:04.677
She needs stitches.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.228
The bite's deep.
There's not much bleeding.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.521
Get me the first aid kit.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.276
What bit me?

14:20.943 --> 14:22.152
A dog.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.488
It had a rare genetic disease.
I was trying to help it.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.282
It was sick.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.075
Am I gonna get sick?

14:28.659 --> 14:30.578
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?

14:30.661 --> 14:31.787
Will I have to quarantine?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.664
No, it's not like Covid.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.501
Why were you even there?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.259
Let me guess. This was your idea?

14:46.093 --> 14:48.554
No, no. It was mine.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.853
I saw some rabbits in cages
when I was at your office.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.355
I just…

14:58.439 --> 15:00.524
I thought
Umbrella was doing testing.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.067
We're not.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.819
We're just trying to cure…

15:03.903 --> 15:04.904
It doesn't matter.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.365
If I hadn't woken up
and realized you were gone,

15:08.449 --> 15:09.950
that you'd taken my keycard…

15:11.994 --> 15:13.996
You can't tell anyone.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.290
Why? What would happen?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.418
And why can't we
take Billie to the hospital?

15:20.252 --> 15:23.255
-If Umbrella knew you were there--
-What, you'd get fired?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.883
-We'd be arrested. All of us.
-What, for trespassing?

15:25.966 --> 15:27.968
And breaking and entering
and destruction of property.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.680
Look, some of the things
in that building are classified,

15:31.764 --> 15:33.015
government projects.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.392
Umbrella can…

15:36.685 --> 15:38.187
We'd never see each other again.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.233
Right now, I can fix this,
but it stays between us.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.321
I need you to say it.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.284
I promise.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.287
Okay.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.835
It's okay. It's okay.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.588
Just breathe, just breathe, squeeze me.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.256
Ow.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.370
<i>The following is</i>
<i>an Umbrella security announcement…</i>

17:55.491 --> 17:57.326
-Yes?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.954
It's Melinda, right?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.247
Do I know you?

18:02.331 --> 18:05.292
Yeah. We… we met about six months back.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.628
Your husband, Barry,
he got me here from Cairo.

18:07.711 --> 18:08.670
Can I talk to him?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.547
I'm sorry. Barry's not home.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.760
-I can wait.
-Uh…

18:25.104 --> 18:27.981
I'm afraid Barry's in Selsey today.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.150
When will he be back?

18:30.234 --> 18:33.112
Um, I never really know.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.243
Sorry. It's feeding time.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.247
This is, uh, Rocky.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.250
Or maybe Sonny.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.502
I can't keep them straight.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.382
What did you say your name was?

18:54.424 --> 18:56.885
The last time I was here,
there was no Umbrella.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.346
-Now they're everywhere.
-Yes.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.141
The city signed a security contract
with them last month.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.559
It's been incredible.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.853
We haven't had
a single infection since then.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.190
I feel so much safer,
what with all the patrols and the cameras.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.233
Yeah.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.944
That's Umbrella. Always watching.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.489
Well, I have nothing to hide.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.285
Right.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.622
I, uh, need to make a call.
Can I use your sat link?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.002
Uh, just one, and then I'll leave.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.265
Arjun.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.018
<i>Jade. I, I've been trying to call.</i>

19:46.101 --> 19:47.978
<i>The, the perimeter alarms</i>
<i>at your camp went off.</i>

19:49.062 --> 19:50.647
<i>I, I didn't know if you were dead.</i>

19:50.731 --> 19:52.024
Not dead.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.444
-<i>What happened?</i>
-Scavengers.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.738
<i>Oh, they took your equipment?</i>

20:00.282 --> 20:01.366
<i>That's fine.</i>

20:01.450 --> 20:02.910
<i>That, we can replace.</i>

20:02.993 --> 20:04.703
They tried to sell me to Umbrella.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.873
The company, they, they know I'm here.

20:07.956 --> 20:08.999
<i>Where are you?</i>

20:09.583 --> 20:10.751
Dover.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.545
But Umbrella's everywhere.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.671
<i>They've taken over. I heard.</i>

20:15.797 --> 20:16.924
<i>You need to get to Calais.</i>

20:17.507 --> 20:18.508
"Calais"?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.929
That, that's Brotherhood territory.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.931
<i>And that's still better than Umbrella.</i>

20:24.014 --> 20:25.766
<i>The Brotherhood hate Umbrella.</i>

20:26.808 --> 20:29.436
<i>Get across the Channel,</i>
<i>I'll, I'll send a team to come meet you.</i>

20:29.519 --> 20:30.646
Get across, how?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.484
<i>I, I… I don't know.</i>

20:38.570 --> 20:41.448
Hey, hey, I'll be okay.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.744
Uh, is, uh… Is Bea there?

20:45.827 --> 20:46.995
Can I talk to her?

20:47.579 --> 20:48.997
<i>She's at ballet practice.</i>

20:51.833 --> 20:54.294
Good. Yeah, that's good.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.757
Hey, uh, tell her I, um…

21:01.510 --> 21:02.636
<i>I will.</i>

21:14.064 --> 21:15.065
<i>Get home to us.</i>

21:25.867 --> 21:27.244
-All done, then?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.122
I need to see Barry.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.498
I could call the authorities.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.126
-Umbrella.
-You don't want to do that.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.294
Oh, watch me.

21:45.804 --> 21:46.888
What was that?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.687
Yeah.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.857
One of the cats must have
gotten locked in the bathroom.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.820
Not a cat.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.440
-Oh!

22:42.569 --> 22:44.029
What the fuck?

22:44.112 --> 22:46.156
When Barry came home
from his last trip, he…

22:46.239 --> 22:47.741
He wasn't feeling well.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.869
The next morning,
I found him chained in the bathroom.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.496
He did that to himself.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.164
You can't keep him chained up in there.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.959
We both know how this ends.
He gets out, and he will kill you.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.253
Marriage is complicated.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.507
Fine. You do you.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.842
But I need to get to France,
and I can't take the ferry.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.427
I need someone to smuggle me out.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.888
Why? What did you do?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.682
Well, I didn't keep
a fucking brain eater in my bathtub.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.725
Let's start there.

23:14.768 --> 23:15.894
Okay.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.605
Did Barry know anyone who could help me?

23:19.189 --> 23:20.148
I, uh…

23:20.774 --> 23:22.192
Oh, maybe.

23:22.275 --> 23:23.485
Charon.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.778
Okay. Where is he?

23:24.861 --> 23:27.489
Why, I, I… I don't know.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.450
I mean, Barry kept all
that sort of thing in his pocketbook.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.911
-Okay, and, and where's the pocketbook?

23:37.249 --> 23:38.583
In his pocket.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.846
Barry.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.722
-She's not going to hurt you.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.353
Easy. Whoa!

23:59.729 --> 24:01.231
Oh, my God!

24:02.524 --> 24:04.276
Seriously, Melinda?

24:04.359 --> 24:06.069
Cats carry disease.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.371
It's not in here.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.914
His other pocket!

24:21.877 --> 24:24.379
-Yeah, yeah.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.631
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.180
Barry.

24:34.431 --> 24:35.765
-Melinda!
-Barry…

25:15.388 --> 25:16.723
You…

25:18.558 --> 25:20.477
You killed him.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.438
-Wait…
-You promised.

25:27.484 --> 25:28.360
Get out.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.404
-Get out!
-Yeah. Yes, that's the plan.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.082
Oh, and by the way, Melinda?

25:42.958 --> 25:45.585
The cat thing? Super fucked up.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.008
<i>Billie?</i>

25:55.220 --> 25:57.138
Billie?

25:57.222 --> 25:58.890
Come in.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.864
How are you feeling?

26:15.448 --> 26:16.283
Sore.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.577
Did you sleep? Look at me.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.746
Not really.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.081
Look right at me.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.377
Why do you keep doing that?

26:28.169 --> 26:32.549
The whites of your eyes, your sclera,
they're good indicators of health.

26:32.632 --> 26:35.051
If the color changes,
it could be an early sign of infection.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.056
So I'm getting sick?

26:41.850 --> 26:42.892
No.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.044
But let's just be on the safe side.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.992
Hey!

27:41.076 --> 27:42.118
How's Billie?

27:42.869 --> 27:44.079
She's staying home today.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.917
It's just a precaution.
I gave her something to help her rest.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.710
-I can stay too.
-No.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.420
Both of you missing school would…

27:53.672 --> 27:55.131
People would notice.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.383
What does that even mean?

27:59.678 --> 28:04.057
The car, in 15. No excuses.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.730
Billie.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.026
Bill.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.750
Thank you.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.462
For saving me.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.662
Oh, sorry!

30:31.246 --> 30:32.455
What's going on?

30:32.539 --> 30:34.165
Simon's got the new <i>Deca-Dence.</i>

30:34.249 --> 30:36.209
It's the super-hard-to-get anime.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.294
Not that hard. It's on Nyaa.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.005
Not here. Umbrella blocks torrent sites.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.217
Simon's, like, the only one
that could get around the firewall.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.930
-Hey.
-Cheers.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.223
See ya.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.316
Impressive.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.568
You'll have to be more specific.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.986
Cute.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.280
The comment's cute, not you.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.991
-You're disgusting.
-Oh, thank you.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.202
I need your help.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.872
Do you normally go around
asking disgusting people for help?

31:13.955 --> 31:16.332
-Not if I can help it.
-You're saying the word help a lot.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.378
I wanna get past Umbrella's firewall.

31:22.505 --> 31:23.590
Why? Porn?

31:25.383 --> 31:26.509
I can't tell you.

31:26.593 --> 31:27.719
So it's porn.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.390
What do I get?

31:32.473 --> 31:33.641
What do you want?

31:42.817 --> 31:43.860
I like your necklace.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.493
Hey, chill.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.831
Where did you learn how to do this?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.666
I, uh, taught myself.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.293
I've lived in Umbrella housing
pretty much my whole life,

32:00.376 --> 32:02.337
so, you know, fuck 'em.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.845
All right. I'm in.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.103
This is crazy.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.898
He's talking about a dude who…

32:21.981 --> 32:25.526
Animal bite turned him psycho,
like eating people psycho.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.778
How did you hear about this?

32:27.445 --> 32:29.072
A friend. From back home.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.660
-Oh, get off. Give me. Give me.
-What?

32:39.582 --> 32:40.750
-Dude.
-What?

32:42.502 --> 32:43.836
It's a joke.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.174
-Like you said. The guy's crazy.

32:48.257 --> 32:49.550
What? No thank you?

32:51.719 --> 32:53.137
Okay! Bye!

33:04.565 --> 33:06.651
Hope you like oatmeal raisin.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.778
My favorite.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.613
Who needs delicious chocolate,

33:10.697 --> 33:13.783
when you can toss a couple
of shriveled up grapes in there?

33:25.128 --> 33:27.714
If I'd known I was having company,
I would have tidied up.

33:27.797 --> 33:30.174
No. No need to fuss.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.219
One of our drones spotted
a person of interest in the area.

33:33.302 --> 33:35.596
Just a few questions and…

33:36.222 --> 33:38.474
We'll be out of your…

33:40.351 --> 33:41.269
hair.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.480
-Can I use your bath--
-No?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.530
-Have you seen--
-Oh, yes.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.741
Horrible woman.
She was looking for my husband.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.325
He's not home, you see.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.706
Cool.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.044
Did she say why?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.788
Ta, Charon.

34:42.705 --> 34:43.581
Next.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.959
-Oi, get in the back of the queue.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.002
Barry sent me.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.213
A minute.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.802
Barry still hasn't paid me
for the last transport.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.553
-Where is he?
-Dead.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.807
I need to get to Calais
without Umbrella knowing.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.059
Yes, love. You and
half the people in this pub.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.310
I hear you've got a way.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.605
If I did, it'd be safe, secure,
and not cheap.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.280
It's not enough.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.032
It's more than enough.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.577
Fee's double for any friend of Barry's.

35:22.411 --> 35:23.371
Next.

35:39.512 --> 35:40.596
Hey.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.848
-Huh?

35:41.931 --> 35:43.182
To the end of the world.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.059
Ta, love.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.529
Al.

35:57.822 --> 35:58.948
You wanted to see me?

35:59.782 --> 36:02.451
I always wanna see you. You know that.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.204
How's your wife?

36:07.832 --> 36:12.044
Diana and I are fine.
Thank you so much for asking.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.006
You find out who hacked us?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.093
Not yet, but we'll figure it out.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.637
We always do.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.223
What do you want, Evelyn?

36:25.057 --> 36:26.767
Like I told you.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.019
Joy.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.396
New and improved
and on shelves in two months.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.815
That isn't possible.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.275
Sure it is.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.986
You're a genius!

36:37.778 --> 36:40.031
Think of all the people
you could help, huh?

36:40.114 --> 36:42.658
Cutters, the spastics.

36:43.367 --> 36:46.829
Hey! The chronic masturbators?

36:48.998 --> 36:49.874
What about us?

36:49.957 --> 36:52.126
On that schedule, we'll make mistakes.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.004
The last time
we made mistakes, people died.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.964
Thousands of people. You were there.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.549
And that was barely contained.

36:58.633 --> 37:02.470
This, if it goes wrong,
you're putting billions at risk.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.643
I won't do it. I'm out.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.901
You're not out.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.280
I'm the only reason you were ever in.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.915
You used to inject once a week.

37:30.998 --> 37:33.459
Now how often? Every other day?

37:34.585 --> 37:36.545
Every day?

37:36.629 --> 37:38.506
Stop talking.

37:40.132 --> 37:43.469
I get it. I do.

37:44.553 --> 37:48.099
You need them.
Your cute little blood bags.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.018
And I need you. So we all need each other.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.105
Right?

37:56.399 --> 37:58.651
-Now get to work.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.094
Okay.

39:07.845 --> 39:08.971
Let's go for a walk.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.977
-Seriously?

39:31.327 --> 39:32.328
<i>Who are you?</i>

39:32.411 --> 39:35.039
-Who are you?
-<i>No, no, no, no. You contacted me.</i>

39:35.122 --> 39:37.083
<i>How do I know you're not with Umbrella?</i>

39:37.166 --> 39:39.543
Well, for starters, I'm fucking 14.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.463
-This was a mistake.
-<i>No, wait, wait.</i>

39:43.839 --> 39:44.882
<i>Your message.</i>

39:45.758 --> 39:47.259
<i>That someone was bitten. Was…</i>

39:48.719 --> 39:49.637
<i>Was it real?</i>

39:50.346 --> 39:52.306
I don't know. Maybe.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.392
What you posted on your site,
was that real?

39:56.310 --> 39:58.104
<i>Listen to me. If this is happening--</i>

39:58.187 --> 40:00.815
I'm not gonna talk to you
if I can't see your face.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.283
<i>My name is Angel Rubio. I…</i>

40:12.701 --> 40:15.496
<i>I was an investigative reporter</i>
<i>at</i> The Baja Post.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.623
But you're not anymore?

40:18.749 --> 40:22.378
<i>I've been looking into Umbrella's</i>
<i>health and safety violations for years.</i>

40:22.461 --> 40:24.630
<i>Okay, people die there.</i>

40:24.713 --> 40:26.715
"Die"? How?

40:26.799 --> 40:30.886
<i>Last week, a worker at the Umbrella lab</i>
<i>went on a rampage,</i>

40:30.970 --> 40:33.139
<i>and he killed nine people.</i>

40:33.222 --> 40:35.057
<i>And when I talked to his wife,</i>

40:35.141 --> 40:38.686
<i>she told me he was bitten</i>
<i>by an animal in the lab.</i>

40:38.769 --> 40:42.273
<i>Within 72 hours,</i>
<i>he became erratic, violent.</i>

40:42.356 --> 40:44.316
<i>He saw things. He heard things.</i>

40:45.693 --> 40:46.819
Where is he now?

40:48.028 --> 40:48.946
<i>Dead.</i>

40:49.780 --> 40:53.701
<i>But when I tried to publish,</i>
<i>well, Umbrella got me fired, hmm?</i>

40:53.784 --> 40:55.786
<i>But people need to hear the truth.</i>

40:55.870 --> 40:59.165
<i>And if this is happening again,</i>
<i>you need to tell me.</i>

40:59.748 --> 41:01.459
<i>Have you seen the bite?</i>

41:04.712 --> 41:08.883
<i>Was there a… a red rash around it?</i>

41:08.966 --> 41:11.719
I… Yeah.

41:11.802 --> 41:14.138
Jade Wesker! Class!

41:14.847 --> 41:16.765
<i>-"Wesker"? No, wait!</i>
-Now!

41:21.645 --> 41:24.690
Dude, slow down. Slow down.

41:24.773 --> 41:25.941
What's wrong with you?

41:28.402 --> 41:29.612
-Hey, stop!

41:30.488 --> 41:31.363
Pablo!

41:31.447 --> 41:32.573
Whoa, whoa, hey, watch it!

41:32.656 --> 41:33.866
-You okay?
-I'm sorry.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.002
Oh, my God. Thank you.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.923
-He slipped out of his collar.
-You should really have him on a harness.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.220
-Is this your dog?
-Yeah.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.349
Pablo, come here. Come here.

41:58.432 --> 42:00.935
Okay. I'm gonna need to see some proof.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.686
What? Like a DNA test?

42:02.770 --> 42:05.439
Like a picture, on your phone.

42:09.443 --> 42:10.986
I left my phone at home.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.784
Look, he clearly
doesn't want to go with you.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.954
I'm gonna take him to the shelter.
They'll sort it out.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.705
You can't do that.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.249
I really can.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.172
What the fuck?

42:33.342 --> 42:34.593
I'm sorry.

42:34.677 --> 42:37.096
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

42:37.179 --> 42:41.475
-Hey. Hey. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Okay.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.911
I swear I…

43:00.995 --> 43:02.329
I had a token.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.665
It's here somewhere.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:04.748 --> 43:07.543
No, no, no. No. Come on, where is it?

43:08.460 --> 43:09.628
Come on!

43:13.424 --> 43:15.259
-Listen up!

43:15.342 --> 43:16.260
Listen up!

43:17.845 --> 43:19.138
This way, people.

43:20.514 --> 43:23.267
We board as soon as she docks.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.235
<i>Halt!</i>

43:33.319 --> 43:36.447
<i>You are engaged in illegal activities</i>
<i>under Umbrella jurisdiction!</i>

43:36.530 --> 43:38.073
<i>Do not resist!</i>
