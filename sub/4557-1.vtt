03:26.673 --> 03:27.640
<i>Corner of Wiltern</i>
<i>and Wetherly.</i>

03:29.275 --> 03:32.642
Tumbler messed up.
He said the Porsche should be...

03:32.712 --> 03:34.805
<i>at the corner</i>
<i>of Wiltern and Wetherly.</i>

03:34.881 --> 03:37.111
- <i>It's right there.</i>
- <i>You're bullshittin' me, right?</i>

03:37.183 --> 03:40.880
- 9024 Wiltern?
- What? That?

03:40.954 --> 03:43.218
I gotta get my tool.

03:43.289 --> 03:46.486
Kip! He ain't
bullshittin'.

03:48.328 --> 03:52.458
<i>Kip! That's not a tool.</i>
<i>That's a damn brick!</i>

03:52.532 --> 03:56.662
Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man, we might
as well call a prison and make reservations.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.296
<i>Ah, come on.</i>

04:02.041 --> 04:04.009
Get the number.

04:06.379 --> 04:09.041
42850.

04:09.115 --> 04:11.811
<i>Hurry up, man.</i>

04:11.884 --> 04:14.512
<i>Man, let's go!</i>

04:16.823 --> 04:18.848
Let's get the hell
outta here.

04:18.925 --> 04:22.156
Okay, Billy Badass,
you got us in here.

04:22.228 --> 04:24.753
Now tell me how the hell
we gonna get out.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.823
Oh, no. I know you ain't gonna do
what I think you're gonna do.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.869
- Oh, man!
- Come on!

04:33.006 --> 04:35.702
- <i>This ain't</i> The Dukes of Hazzard.
- Come on!

04:50.590 --> 04:54.026
Yo, so check out my new move.
I call it "The Stranger."

04:54.093 --> 04:58.325
What I do is, I sit on my hand
for like 15, 20 minutes...

04:58.398 --> 05:01.765
<i>until it goes numb,</i>
<i>no feeling at all.</i>

05:01.834 --> 05:04.302
And then... I rub one out.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.201
The Stranger, huh?

05:06.272 --> 05:09.901
It's like a little boys' nursery
school I've come upon here.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.274
Where are they?

05:16.949 --> 05:19.179
- <i>You want it? All right.</i>
- Hey.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.085
- <i>Leave those people alone.</i>
- Oh, my God. Sweetie, you're so talented.

05:22.155 --> 05:26.057
- Wha... Hey, hey. Stolen car. Stolen car.
- I know. I know.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.389
Hey, I love you.

05:32.498 --> 05:36.059
Man, we goin' to jail, man!

05:36.135 --> 05:38.501
Come on!

05:43.109 --> 05:46.840
Keep your hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.438
Hey, watch it!

05:51.751 --> 05:54.515
We have a silver Porsche.
Estimated speed: 80 miles per hour.

05:54.587 --> 05:58.421
Heading west on Wilshire Boulevard.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.289
<i>This is Air One. We have a visual</i>
<i>of the suspect southbound...</i>

06:01.361 --> 06:04.194
<i>on Vincent Thomas Bridge.</i>

06:06.232 --> 06:12.262
- Something wrong, Tumbler?
- Yeah, I'm missing <i>Jerry Springer</i>.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.266
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

06:23.349 --> 06:26.341
That's right, that's right,
that's right, that's right!

06:29.655 --> 06:31.748
What's up, old man?

06:31.824 --> 06:34.486
She'll go zero to 60
in 5.2 seconds.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.188
<i>Believe me,</i>
<i>I can vouch for that.</i>

06:37.263 --> 06:40.858
<i>Ground units be advised, suspects last</i>
<i>seen entering south side of warehouse.</i>

06:40.933 --> 06:44.391
Thirteen down, thirty-seven to go.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.238
- What the hell is that?
- What is that, man?

06:53.312 --> 06:56.042
- Now you've gone and done it, Raines.
- Tumbler!

06:56.115 --> 06:58.379
- Get the board and get the lights!
- <i>I got it, I got it!</i>

06:58.451 --> 07:00.681
This is bullshit.
It's not comin' off!

07:00.753 --> 07:03.017
- <i>Keys! Get the keys!</i>
- I got 'em. I got 'em!

07:03.089 --> 07:06.115
<i>Come on, everybody!</i>
<i>Let's go! Hurry up!</i>

07:06.192 --> 07:09.423
- I got it!
- <i>Let's go! Toby, get it!</i>

07:09.495 --> 07:12.760
- <i>Let's go, boys!</i>
- Come on, come on! I got the light!

07:12.832 --> 07:15.596
Go, go, go!
Let's go!

07:17.270 --> 07:19.465
Shit!

07:33.219 --> 07:35.585
<i>Get the VIN number on that?</i>

07:35.655 --> 07:38.783
- <i>I got it.</i>
- <i>We've got a lamp shade by a truck.</i>

07:38.858 --> 07:42.055
What do we got?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.995
All gone. We didn't get
a single one of 'em.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.692
And we are talking
about professionals.

07:47.767 --> 07:52.033
No visible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions.

07:52.104 --> 07:55.232
And, as you can see,
these are not Honda Civics.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.072
This is one of three
brand-new Mercedes,

07:58.144 --> 08:01.739
a car they say
is unstealable.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.908
Yeah, unless you get
the laser-cut transponder key...

08:04.984 --> 08:07.475
sent directly to the U.S.
Dealer from Hamburg.

08:07.553 --> 08:10.044
They got somebody
working on the inside.

08:10.122 --> 08:14.923
- Find out which dealership sold them, serviced them, etc., etc.
- Yeah, I'll get on it.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.157
- Mr. Drycoff?
- Yeah?

08:19.232 --> 08:23.635
Let's impound these cars for one month. I
don't give a damn if they belong to Tom Cruise.

08:49.929 --> 08:54.491
<i>Control, vision, determination.</i>

08:54.567 --> 08:57.866
These are the three
fundamental components...

08:57.937 --> 09:00.804
of the new generation
race car driver.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.172
Speed is a byproduct.
Going fast.

09:04.243 --> 09:09.271
But remember: The car is you,
you are the car.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.351
Okay? Let's ride!

09:17.523 --> 09:21.789
Billy, you just shaved
one second off your lap time!

09:35.441 --> 09:38.501
Tommy, I don't know what
that was, but it wasn't driving.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.283
Go get 'em!

09:52.558 --> 09:55.994
Well, well, well. What do you pay
your pit crews with?

09:56.062 --> 09:58.758
Oreos and Gummy Bears?

09:58.831 --> 10:03.268
I folded, Atley. You know that.
What are you doing here?

10:03.336 --> 10:05.930
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- About what?

10:06.005 --> 10:08.064
About your brother
and the deep shit he's in.

10:08.140 --> 10:12.304
Frank, can you watch
the kids for a minute?

10:19.285 --> 10:21.219
Tell me about Kip.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.017
He took a job,
and he fumbled it.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.218
Now he's jammed up.
He's jammed up bad.

10:27.293 --> 10:32.196
- What kind of job?
- A boost. A big boost.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.630
A boost?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.397
What's Kip doing on a boost?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.771
Oh, you're shittin' me, man.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.970
Kip's become quite
the little crew runner since you left.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.536
You don't talk to your ma?

10:48.614 --> 10:51.048
She neglected to mention it.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.847
Listen, I need something.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.217
I-I need something
cold to drink.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.587
I thought we were goin'
someplace to talk.

11:04.230 --> 11:09.258
- Who was the job for?
- A new guy named Raymond Calitri.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.133
They call him
"The Carpenter."

11:12.204 --> 11:15.401
He's runnin' all the dark
ponies down there now.

11:15.474 --> 11:19.843
It's a full-on "Devil came
down to Long Beach" trip.

11:19.912 --> 11:23.905
He's bad.
He's real bad.

11:23.983 --> 11:27.783
And this Calitri is the one
who's after my brother?

11:27.853 --> 11:29.821
Like stains on a mattress.

11:31.490 --> 11:34.288
And you should know...
I work for him.

11:36.762 --> 11:42.098
There weren't a lot of opportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.160
He put me to work.

11:45.237 --> 11:50.766
I-I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out of even me.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.362
What are you doin', man?

12:15.434 --> 12:19.996
Stop! Stop!

12:24.243 --> 12:26.905
Atley Jackson.

12:26.979 --> 12:30.745
<i>Got it. They have Kip.</i>

12:30.816 --> 12:33.080
Take me there.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.540
Raymond Calitri,
Memphis Raines.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.847
I try...

13:06.919 --> 13:10.446
to learn your ways,
understand your obsessions.

13:10.523 --> 13:14.289
<i>But this baseball...</i>
<i>it's so bleeding boring, isn't it?</i>

13:14.360 --> 13:16.692
Where's my brother?

13:18.697 --> 13:21.791
Memphis Raines,
your legend precedes you.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.233
Atley tells me
you're the best.

13:24.303 --> 13:28.069
<i>After you left, auto theft in the</i>
<i>South Bay area went down 47 percent.</i>

13:28.140 --> 13:30.734
Where's my brother?

13:32.711 --> 13:36.511
<i>I'm proud of these. Straddle chair</i>
<i>from the Arts and Crafts period.</i>

13:36.582 --> 13:39.142
Mahogany table
with cloud-lift pattern.

13:39.218 --> 13:42.312
Black walnut wine table.
Metal's cold, ugly.

13:42.388 --> 13:46.848
<i>Wood's warm, clean,</i>
<i>provided by nature.</i>

13:46.926 --> 13:51.488
See a piece of furniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.965
I asked you a question.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.935
They threw us out of England,
threw us out of France,

13:58.003 --> 14:00.471
but here we are,
flourishing really,

14:00.539 --> 14:05.238
except for the minor inconvenience of
despising everything about your country.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.337
On this list you'll find
50 cars... five-zero.

14:08.414 --> 14:14.148
I need all 50 delivered to Long Beach Harbor,
pier 14 by 8:00 a.m. Four days from now.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.188
I'm paying $200,000.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.780
I'm not interested.
I'm just here for my brother.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.385
Young Kip came to me.
He had street cred.

14:22.461 --> 14:25.430
The brother of the notorious
Memphis Raines.

14:25.497 --> 14:29.194
So two weeks ago I hired him
and advanced him $10,000.

14:29.268 --> 14:33.705
Atley told me. If it's about the
advance, I can understand your anger.

14:33.772 --> 14:39.267
The debt has to be settled.
Ten grand, from me to you.

14:39.345 --> 14:43.042
- I wish it was that easy.
- I don't see the complication.

14:43.115 --> 14:46.312
I have four days to deliver 50 cars,
and I have no cars.

14:46.385 --> 14:50.048
- Well, that's another problem.
- It is another problem, isn't it?

14:50.122 --> 14:54.388
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars
because I said I would.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.089
Because if I don't, my South American
friend goes somewhere else from now on.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.597
And that's not good.
It's a humiliation.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.964
Because I'm the asshole
who said I could deliver.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.560
Am I an asshole?
Do I look like an asshole?

15:05.638 --> 15:09.039
Yeah.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.908
- I need that paper satisfied.
- I'm retired.

15:13.979 --> 15:17.176
And where the hell
is my brother?

15:21.553 --> 15:24.078
I made this as well.

15:24.156 --> 15:27.250
My first one.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.905
It takes 80,000 pounds
of pressure to crush a car.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.948
- Kip?
- Who's that?

16:00.025 --> 16:03.392
- Memphis.
- Oh, shit.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.191
You okay?

16:08.667 --> 16:11.864
Shut it off!

16:11.937 --> 16:14.770
- <i>Turn it off!</i>
- You've got 30 seconds to consider your options.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.809
- Shut it off!
- One: You kill me; they kill you.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.242
Your brother dies anyway.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.611
Two: You lie, you accept the job,
you take your brother, you run.

16:23.682 --> 16:27.209
I hunt you down, I kill you, I kill
your brother, and I kill your mother...

16:27.286 --> 16:29.777
for the aggravation
you've caused me.

16:29.855 --> 16:33.154
<i>Three: You accept the deal,</i>
<i>you steal some cars,</i>

16:33.225 --> 16:35.420
you make some money
and you be a big brother.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.670
- <i>Memphis!</i>
- 8:00 a.m. Friday morning.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.937
The cars are on the boat,
or your brother's in the coffin.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.343
<i>Get me outta here!</i>
<i>Somebody get me outta here.</i>

17:01.553 --> 17:04.545
<i>Listen, you really don't</i>
<i>have to make me anything.</i>

17:04.623 --> 17:06.784
Oh, hey, you come down here.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.986
You saved my ass.
It's the least I can do.

17:11.363 --> 17:15.993
Hey, I heard you were, uh, pumping gas
someplace up North or something, right?

17:16.068 --> 17:18.628
- Yeah, working with kids.
- Oh, really?

17:21.306 --> 17:26.938
"First place."
I remember this.

17:27.012 --> 17:31.005
Oh, yeah, that was...
that was a long time ago.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.918
What'd you put in it?

17:42.995 --> 17:45.657
I don't know.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.370
It's good.

17:56.175 --> 17:59.303
Ow. Ow. Oh, God.

17:59.378 --> 18:03.178
Does Mom know
about any of this?

18:03.248 --> 18:06.706
No, no, no, she doesn't,
and I don't think she should.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.811
You know, she... she works
really hard, and this... this...

18:09.888 --> 18:12.652
She doesn't need to know
about any of this stuff.

18:12.724 --> 18:16.023
Look, you know,
I got everything under control.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.563
Kitchen's on fire.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.668
Uh, man.

18:32.978 --> 18:36.072
Hey, Memphis.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.480
It's good to see you.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.349
<i>Haul the cartons over there!</i>

18:45.424 --> 18:48.291
- <i>Hey, Fuzzy.</i>
- Aw, shit. What are you doin' here?

18:48.360 --> 18:52.854
- I told you I don't know anything.
- Yeah, but you're a liar.

18:52.931 --> 18:56.833
- You're gonna get me fired, man.
- Fired? That's not good. You're on parole, right?

18:56.902 --> 19:00.065
Fuzzy, hey, nobody
wants to get you fired.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.040
We just need this
information is all.

19:03.108 --> 19:06.373
Two weeks ago, a call came in
for a lot of top-end cars.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.414
- And who made that call?
- I don't have a clue.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.211
- Okay. We should go talk to your boss.
- Oh, shhh.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.583
The delivery date.
I know the delivery date.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.122
- And when is that?
- Thursday, Friday, end of the week.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.057
Well, you get me a name
within 48 hours, or we'll be back.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.060
Good to see you, buddy.

19:23.128 --> 19:25.062
Thank you.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.397
I'm looking
for Helen Raines.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.530
<i>Helen, some guy's</i>
<i>here for you.</i>

19:34.606 --> 19:36.801
What guy?
What's he look like?

19:36.875 --> 19:39.435
Like a firecracker.
Like your son.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.809
You look so good.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.247
Thank you, Momma. Here.
Spring... Spring bouquet.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.877
What are you doing here?

19:47.953 --> 19:51.548
Well, uh, Atley Jackson
came to see me.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.750
Told me something about Kip.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.487
Can I help you
with one of these?

19:59.598 --> 20:02.658
<i>Okay, that's yours.</i>

20:02.734 --> 20:06.830
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe
who just walked into the Quality Cafe.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.965
I can't say I'm surprised.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.808
All his life he looked up to you,
tried to be you.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.973
I guess now he is.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.280
So why is this happening?
I send you guys money.

20:20.352 --> 20:24.686
He... He met some people,
and he changed.

20:24.756 --> 20:29.352
He lost that...
that sweetness, you know?

20:30.963 --> 20:36.299
Okay... tell me.
How deep in is he?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.427
Deep.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.301
Can you get him out?

20:43.275 --> 20:46.369
It means doin' things,

20:46.445 --> 20:49.676
things I told you
I'd never do again.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.774
Do what it takes, Randall.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.723
<i>When did you get into town, Raines?</i>

21:06.798 --> 21:09.528
- Last night.
- Last night? What for?

21:09.601 --> 21:11.933
I thought I'd catch a Lakers game.
Heard we got Shaquille.

21:12.004 --> 21:15.098
Guys wanna go?

21:15.173 --> 21:19.337
- Guess not.
- Randall, Randall, Randall, come here.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.312
I get this call from this
uniform, you know?

21:22.381 --> 21:25.145
Axton. Very nice man.
Remembers everything.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.345
This man calls me up, says, "Guess
who's back in town?" I say, "Who?"

21:28.420 --> 21:31.856
<i>He says, "Randall Raines."</i>
<i>I say, "Randall Raines the car thief?"</i>

21:31.923 --> 21:34.153
He says, "Yeah." I say, "Impossible."
He says, "No, he's back."

21:34.226 --> 21:37.821
I say, "No, he's not." He says, "Yes, I
will bet you $200 I just saw Randall Raines."

21:37.896 --> 21:41.332
- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective...
- <i>No, whoa, whoa.</i>

21:41.400 --> 21:44.335
What's really, really
ironic about this...

21:44.403 --> 21:48.032
Two nights ago we snare these
13 fresh stolens waiting for export.

21:48.106 --> 21:52.566
At the time I'm thinking,
"This feels like Randall Raines."

21:52.644 --> 21:55.670
Now, it didn't have your
panache, your, uh, flash,

21:55.747 --> 21:58.944
but it just felt
like Randall Raines.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.042
<i>And now here you are.</i>

22:01.119 --> 22:04.680
Look, I don't know what you boys are
looking for, but I just got back, okay?

22:04.756 --> 22:07.418
It was a family emergency.
Now, that's the truth.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.859
Family emergency. Yeah, I got
a family emergency too, Randall.

22:10.929 --> 22:15.025
I gotta go tell my woman
that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.092
- Mmm, she's mean.
- What?

22:18.170 --> 22:21.867
She can be mean.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.500
Come here.
Come here, Randall.

22:24.576 --> 22:28.239
Take those glasses off, Randall.
Please, do me a favor.

22:29.781 --> 22:33.182
Six years ago you make
a real smart move, you know?

22:33.251 --> 22:36.584
You retire from a life that's gonna get
you busted or killed or maybe even both.

22:36.655 --> 22:40.523
And I'm thinkin' that not putting
you away when I had a chance...

22:40.592 --> 22:45.393
is like this big bug up the ass of this
real impressive career that I've had.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.398
Oh, yeah.

22:47.466 --> 22:51.596
Well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate victory.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.797
Eleanor tell you that?

22:53.872 --> 22:55.897
Now, that's hittin'
below the belt.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.534
Yeah, all right, let me tell you
about below the belt, Randall.

22:58.610 --> 23:01.636
From here on out, if you walk across
the street outside of a crosswalk,

23:01.713 --> 23:04.147
if you roll
through a stop sign,

23:04.216 --> 23:07.447
if you use an aerosol can in
a manner other than directed...

23:07.519 --> 23:10.147
I mean, I don't care,
you make one slip,

23:10.222 --> 23:12.417
and I will put you away
for good.

23:12.491 --> 23:15.016
- Okay.
- <i>By the time you get out, asshole,</i>

23:15.093 --> 23:17.254
there won't even be cars.

23:17.329 --> 23:21.163
We'll all be cruising around
in your little, vroom, spaceships.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.031
That's gonna suck.

23:26.371 --> 23:28.305
Who's Eleanor?

23:28.373 --> 23:30.307
It's a damn car.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.640
And don't ever
talk about my wife.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.451
Excuse me.
You know where Otto is?

23:42.521 --> 23:46.617
He's in the back, in the paint shop.

23:54.566 --> 23:59.469
Is that you? About time
you came to see me.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.403
- I missed you.
- Good to see you!

24:01.506 --> 24:04.373
You look great.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.378
- It's good to see you.
- You too. Oh, remember my Junie?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.175
Hey, Junie.
How are you?

24:09.247 --> 24:11.807
- We're doin' good, thank you.
- Good, good.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.317
You look happy.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.581
Well, I am happy.
I really am.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.589
So what happened here?

24:18.657 --> 24:20.648
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's nice.

24:20.725 --> 24:24.388
But the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.398
What happened? Hey.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.730
Old age happened.
That's what happened.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.098
Got tired of killing 'em.

24:31.169 --> 24:33.603
You know, I woke up
one morning and thought,

24:33.672 --> 24:36.732
"I'm no longer a destroyer.
I'm a means of resurrection."

24:36.808 --> 24:39.276
Now we restore,
we revive.

24:39.344 --> 24:41.744
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Remember we used to do this?</i>

24:41.813 --> 24:45.544
- What?
- You know. Come here. Okay.

24:45.617 --> 24:48.916
It's a Ferrari 365 GTB-4 Daytona.

24:48.987 --> 24:52.081
Le Mans, 1971.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.920
- <i>Five cam...</i>
- That's a V-12.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.222
V-12, right, right,
right, right!

24:56.294 --> 25:00.890
Here it peaks
at 5,500 r.p.m.!

25:00.966 --> 25:03.935
- What do you know about Raymond Calitri?
- Who?

25:04.002 --> 25:05.731
Raymond Calitri.

25:07.472 --> 25:10.532
Uh, excuse us, sweetness.
I'll be right back.

25:10.609 --> 25:12.907
- We can talk here.
- No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.105
Raymond Calitri.

25:15.180 --> 25:20.049
He's a jackal tearing at the
soft belly of our... of our fair town.

25:20.118 --> 25:24.782
And he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.

25:24.856 --> 25:29.725
I heard about Kip.
Are you considering a comeback tour?

25:29.794 --> 25:33.525
- Do you think it can be done?
- Don't do this to me, okay?

25:33.598 --> 25:36.692
Please, please not now.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.128
<i>Oh, man.</i>

25:46.912 --> 25:49.881
- How many cars?
- <i>Fifty.</i>

25:49.948 --> 25:53.611
- How many days?
- <i>Three.</i>

25:53.685 --> 25:55.949
How many in your crew?

25:56.021 --> 25:59.457
One, but I came here
hoping to negotiate for a second.

25:59.524 --> 26:01.389
No way.
It can't be done.

26:01.459 --> 26:04.951
I mean, you need time to prep,
time to shop. You know that.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.498
It has to be.
They're gonna kill him.

26:11.703 --> 26:13.637
Oh, man.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.443
It was a mistake
to come here.

26:24.516 --> 26:28.646
You have a great life now.
I don't want to upset that.

26:32.357 --> 26:36.851
<i>Uh, wait a minute.</i>
<i>Uh, hold on.</i>

26:36.928 --> 26:39.123
Look around you.

26:39.197 --> 26:43.463
These days...
I'm all about second chances.

26:43.535 --> 26:47.301
So, uh, let's make a few phone calls,
and we'll go from there, okay?

26:47.372 --> 26:49.863
Okay.

26:50.041 --> 26:54.171
- Don't look at me!
Look at the people next to you!

26:54.245 --> 26:56.713
That's... Turn the wheel!

26:56.781 --> 27:00.512
Pull over! Pull her the hell over!

27:00.585 --> 27:02.553
Asshole!

27:02.621 --> 27:04.782
Learn how to drive!

27:04.856 --> 27:08.792
Don't touch nothing. Just...

27:08.860 --> 27:11.693
No!

27:11.763 --> 27:15.494
You can't negotiate turns.
You can't signal properly.

27:15.567 --> 27:20.937
You can't maintain speed. You can't
parallel park. Hell, you can't drive, honey.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.474
Shit, I can't swim.
I know I can't.

27:23.541 --> 27:27.272
So you know what I do?
I stay my black ass outta the pool.

27:27.345 --> 27:30.280
All right now, just...

27:33.251 --> 27:36.118
Can you... Oh!
Hello?

27:36.187 --> 27:40.681
Memphis! Hey, how are you?

27:40.759 --> 27:45.560
Sure, sure.
When? Okay.

27:45.630 --> 27:47.962
- 32969811.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.058
Donny.

27:51.703 --> 27:54.536
Just take it around the block
a couple of times, okay?

27:54.606 --> 27:56.904
<i>All right.</i>

28:02.514 --> 28:05.449
Hello. I'm calling
for Frankie Fish.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.452
Frank's dead, man.
Yeah, he got scragged.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.786
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, yeah, I'm looking for Henry Santoro.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.758
He went down to Florida
with that asshole Frankie Fish.

28:15.827 --> 28:18.091
- <i>Tell him I want my money.</i>
- I didn't mess with your money.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.290
Yes, ma'am. I'm looking
for Dan and Mikey.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.731
Both of 'em up to Chino.
Doin' a nickel apiece.

28:22.801 --> 28:24.792
Now I'm not so sure
I want to tell you who this is.

28:24.869 --> 28:28.134
- Yeah, try it, asshole.
- You sound very busy right now.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.470
You sound very, very busy.

28:33.044 --> 28:36.172
Whew. There's
only two names left.

28:36.247 --> 28:40.013
Yeah? Let me see.

28:40.085 --> 28:42.110
<i>Those two? No way.</i>

28:42.187 --> 28:44.121
There's no one else.

28:44.189 --> 28:46.885
Are you sure?

28:48.426 --> 28:50.417
- You tell him.
- Listen, why should I...

28:50.495 --> 28:52.690
- Come on!
- You were the one who answered the phone.

28:52.764 --> 28:56.325
- Fine! Fine!
- But how's a guy who can't speak gonna take a phone call?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.961
<i>You've got a call!</i>

29:14.753 --> 29:16.812
Sphinx, is that you?

29:16.888 --> 29:19.448
Press a button if it's you.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.729
Sway, you set up
this brake job?

29:29.801 --> 29:32.065
<i>Yeah. He warped all four rotors.</i>

29:32.137 --> 29:34.571
<i>Must've been ridin' those</i>
<i>brakes like an old lady.</i>

29:34.639 --> 29:37.870
- <i>That's nice.</i>
- Sounds like the left bank's running lean.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.978
The service department's
over there.

29:52.056 --> 29:55.719
- Can I talk to you?
- Talk to me? Yeah, sure, talk.

29:55.794 --> 30:00.163
- The thing of it is, I came back because...
- Do you know what time it is?

30:00.231 --> 30:03.325
It's 5:30.
I came back because...

30:03.401 --> 30:06.336
I gotta go.
I'm late for work.

30:09.107 --> 30:11.041
You're at work.

30:11.109 --> 30:14.044
I got two jobs.

30:14.112 --> 30:19.914
I have discovered that you have
to work twice as hard when it's honest.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.589
- Hey, Sway, can I get another shot?
- Yep.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.151
Still lookin' amazing.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.789
While you look
like a Bible salesman.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.299
You're healed.

30:36.367 --> 30:38.835
<i>Can we improvise</i>
<i>a little bit?</i>

30:38.903 --> 30:41.804
Sure. What do you have in mind?
Wanna get a little crazy?

30:41.873 --> 30:44.865
There's a Cutlass 442 in the back
we can strip down and shine the hood.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.538
- What do you say?
- Uh, that's not what I had in mind.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.604
No?

30:50.682 --> 30:53.276
It's about my brother.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.478
- Kip's in trouble.
- I n trouble?

30:55.553 --> 30:57.783
- Took a boost, and he blew it.
- Shit.

30:57.856 --> 31:01.622
And you got some Italians?

31:01.693 --> 31:04.093
- Five or six.
- <i>Right.</i>

31:04.162 --> 31:07.620
It's 50 ladies in 24 hours,
$200,000.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.327
Well, I've cleaned up.

31:15.073 --> 31:17.906
I understand. I hate
to even come here and ask...

31:17.976 --> 31:20.035
Sway, can I get
that drink now, please?

31:20.111 --> 31:24.138
I had to ask a few of the others too,
and I feel bad about it, but...

31:24.215 --> 31:27.514
- But you had no choice. You had to come here...
- Pretty much.

31:27.585 --> 31:30.520
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

31:32.590 --> 31:36.185
I'd love to help Kip,
but I-I'm not into the life anymore.

31:38.263 --> 31:40.595
Well, that's a good thing.

31:40.665 --> 31:44.499
- Yeah.
- I'm glad to see you're doing well.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.764
Sorry, I can't help you.

31:46.838 --> 31:50.330
- I'd like to pay for your drink.
- That's fine.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.774
How about that drink?

31:54.846 --> 31:57.440
Yeah, how about that drink?

31:58.583 --> 32:02.451
<i>Raines!</i>
<i>Memphis Raines, huh?</i>

32:02.520 --> 32:04.545
- Do I know you?
- <i>Well, you should know me...</i>

32:04.622 --> 32:09.082
considering all the business you done
screwed up for me in the past, baby.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.628
- Johnny B.
- That's me.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.664
What can I do for you?

32:13.731 --> 32:16.495
Well, I'm gonna tell you
what you can do for me, baby.

32:16.567 --> 32:19.331
Get out of Long Beach, tonight.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.872
I'll be gone in three days.
I'm just here on some family business.

32:21.940 --> 32:26.036
Word on the street says Raymond Calitri
hired you and your brother...

32:26.110 --> 32:29.307
for a top order, a order
that should've went to me.

32:29.380 --> 32:32.076
That's not the way
it went down, Johnny.

32:44.128 --> 32:48.531
Hey! Get away
from my car, asshole!

33:02.981 --> 33:05.449
<i>Got somethin' to say</i>
<i>before I kill you, fool?</i>

33:25.737 --> 33:29.298
Sphinx. Otto send you?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.917
Oh, Dad.

33:48.993 --> 33:52.554
We'd probably both be working
at the dealership if he hadn't died,

33:52.630 --> 33:55.258
just like normal people.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.994
Shit.

34:01.973 --> 34:04.441
What's the matter with you?

34:04.509 --> 34:08.639
Eh, six years does
a lot of different things to people.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.841
<i>You know, I don't know</i>
<i>where you went, but...</i>

34:11.916 --> 34:14.942
you know, you're in there,
you're talking about being normal...

34:15.019 --> 34:18.147
<i>I mean, you were always the one</i>
<i>who was goin' after the easy money.</i>

34:22.727 --> 34:25.662
I didn't do it
for the money.

34:27.732 --> 34:31.031
I did it for the cars.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.569
Gleaming in marina blue,

34:35.640 --> 34:38.131
sunfire yellow,

34:38.209 --> 34:40.200
Marlboro red.

34:40.278 --> 34:43.975
<i>Begging to be plucked.</i>

34:45.516 --> 34:47.848
And I'd do it.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.752
I'd boost her...

34:50.822 --> 34:53.814
and just blast
to Palm Springs,

34:53.891 --> 34:57.452
instantly feeling better
about being me.

34:57.528 --> 35:01.328
<i>And then the next day,</i>
<i>it seems like,</i>

35:01.399 --> 35:05.426
<i>I'm getting shot at,</i>
<i>my friends are dying,</i>

35:05.503 --> 35:07.494
<i>people are going to jail.</i>

35:07.572 --> 35:10.541
I didn't like
what I'd become.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.678
Yeah, and then you left,

35:16.747 --> 35:20.183
and then I didn't
have a brother anymore,

35:20.251 --> 35:23.311
<i>and now you want</i>
<i>to give me advice...</i>

35:23.387 --> 35:25.685
<i>and I don't even know you.</i>

35:25.756 --> 35:29.248
<i>And, you know, I got my own family now,</i>
<i>I got my own friends.</i>

35:29.327 --> 35:32.353
And you can say what you want
about them, but they're loyal.

35:34.565 --> 35:38.092
Well, when you hit the wall,
the same thing's gonna happen.

35:38.169 --> 35:41.161
You and your family...

35:41.239 --> 35:44.436
<i>are either</i>
<i>gonna get shot...</i>

35:44.509 --> 35:47.603
or get a five-year
jolt at Corcoran.

35:57.922 --> 36:01.881
<i>Those Mercedes we impounded?</i>
<i>Need those newfangled laser-cut keys.</i>

36:01.959 --> 36:04.894
Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors
downtown Newport...

36:04.962 --> 36:07.453
where all the employees
are clean, except for him.

36:07.532 --> 36:11.468
James Lakewood. Served a nickel
at Folsom for auto insurance fraud.

36:11.536 --> 36:16.803
My gosh, I bet he just neglected to mention that
to the people at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh?

36:16.874 --> 36:19.934
It gets better. Young James there
places orders for lost keys...

36:20.011 --> 36:23.606
to the Mercedes
home office in Germany.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.121
The list.

36:31.189 --> 36:35.023
The list. I guess we gotta start beating
the bushes and try to find out where they...

36:35.092 --> 36:38.528
- Whoa! 1967 Shelby GT-500.
- <i>I know. I know.</i>

36:38.596 --> 36:42.054
- You got Eleanor here?
- Otto, there's somebody here to see you.

36:43.801 --> 36:46.395
<i>Oh, the puppy's</i>
<i>a big dog now!</i>

36:46.470 --> 36:50.566
- <i>How are you doin'?</i>
- Hey there, Kip, what is this... What's that up under there?

36:50.641 --> 36:53.132
Hey, Otto, how you doin'?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.270
It's a long time.
Good to see you.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.712
What are you
doin' here, Kip?

36:57.782 --> 37:01.240
- Well, we actually came to talk about some things.
- About what?

37:01.319 --> 37:04.379
Well, you know, it seems like
you guys need a little help,

37:04.455 --> 37:06.753
<i>and we thought</i>
<i>that we should participate.</i>

37:06.824 --> 37:08.792
But I just promised Mom
I was getting you out of this.

37:08.859 --> 37:11.089
No, no, we're talking
about a lot of money here.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.995
- And if you guys think you're gonna
get into our Kool-Aid... - - What? Money?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.898
Is that why you think I'm doing this,
you inconsiderate little punk!

37:16.968 --> 37:20.404
If you wanna participate, well, then
you call Mom and you explain to her...

37:20.471 --> 37:23.702
<i>Can you explain how you are gonna</i>
<i>steal 50 cars in two days?</i>

37:23.774 --> 37:27.073
Hey. Hey.

37:27.144 --> 37:30.079
This is why I do not
do business with family.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.707
I think you should
consider this.

37:32.783 --> 37:36.378
Oh, come on, Otto, please. No, his
criminal career has come to an end.

37:36.454 --> 37:39.355
Well, his life will come to an end
unless we pull this off.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.620
How can we do it without them?
It can't be done, and you know it.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.831
You guys have
any skills at all?

37:48.899 --> 37:51.459
- Please!
- Yeah, we have skills.

37:51.535 --> 37:54.936
We... Mirror Man here,
he's an electronics expert.

37:55.006 --> 37:58.373
You know, he's got some gadgets that...
that you old farts probably never heard of.

37:58.442 --> 38:02.344
You know, uh, Tumbler over here, he can
pretty much drive anything with wheels...

38:02.413 --> 38:04.779
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>some things without wheels.</i>

38:04.849 --> 38:07.784
And, uh, and Toby,
he's a computer genius.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.821
He's... He does fascinating
things with computers.

38:10.888 --> 38:13.721
What exactly can you do
with a computer, Toby?

38:13.791 --> 38:15.782
I can hack
into the D.M.V. Mainframe.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.660
<i>I can change VIN numbers.</i>
<i>I can change addresses, registrations.</i>

38:19.730 --> 38:22.062
I can do a lot
of really tricky stuff. I can.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.330
All right, all right.
We do this, we do it my way.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.803
I run the show.
You take your orders from me.

38:27.872 --> 38:29.965
If you have any problems
with that, you can leave now.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.032
No, that's fine.
That's fine.

38:32.109 --> 38:35.977
- Well, who is Gilligan here, and what does he do?
- <i>Gilligan is actually Freb.</i>

38:36.047 --> 38:38.811
- Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business.
- What?

38:38.883 --> 38:42.512
- <i>It's true.</i>
- Hey, people gotta eat, right?

38:44.388 --> 38:47.687
This is outrageous.
I want my lawyer.

38:47.758 --> 38:50.784
I'm not saying a word
till I get a lawyer.

38:50.861 --> 38:53.295
All right, James,
that's an option.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.730
And frankly,
a reasonable one.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.734
So you call
your lawyer, James.

38:57.802 --> 39:00.999
You tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion of grand theft auto.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.097
- <i>We indict you.</i>
- He'll bail you out.

39:03.174 --> 39:07.110
- And we move on to trial.
- Okay, okay.

39:07.178 --> 39:11.774
A kid came to me,
said he'd pay $500 a key.

39:11.849 --> 39:16.718
So I put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.

39:16.787 --> 39:20.518
- What's the kid's name?
- We kept it anonymous.

39:20.591 --> 39:26.427
He was a well-built kid.
Uh, looks like a boxer.

39:26.497 --> 39:30.092
- What do you want me to do?
- When he comes back, you call us.

39:30.167 --> 39:33.898
- What says he comes back?
- A hunch.

39:34.038 --> 39:37.530
To make the Friday 8:00 a.m. Deadline,
you're gonna have to go old school.

39:37.608 --> 39:41.942
A one-night boost.
Put all your nuts in one basket, okay?

39:42.012 --> 39:44.640
- One night? What, are you crazy?
- <i>Yes. No, I'm not crazy.</i>

39:44.715 --> 39:47.149
- What, do you have like a better plan or something'?
- Yeah, you spread it out.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.244
- You play shadow games and shit.
- We're on a truncated timetable.

39:50.321 --> 39:53.313
Otto, I'm sorry. Can you just listen
to me for one second, all right?

39:53.391 --> 39:56.724
<i>We heard you, Kip. Shadow games.</i>
<i>But what you have to understand...</i>

39:56.794 --> 40:00.457
is that if you play shadow games, by
the second night, the heat is onto you.

40:00.531 --> 40:04.092
With a one-night boost, by the time
the first car's reported stolen,

40:04.168 --> 40:07.467
your ship's set sail;
it's a surprise attack.

40:07.538 --> 40:11.975
This is a complicated list,
fellas, it really is, okay?

40:12.042 --> 40:14.670
<i>There are 25</i>
<i>that aren't a problem,</i>

40:14.745 --> 40:16.906
but these exotics
are tough to find.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.745
And the new Mercedes,
they require laser-cut keys, okay?

40:19.817 --> 40:23.184
- Yeah, I got that covered.
- You have that covered?

40:23.254 --> 40:25.518
- What'd I just say? Yeah, I got it covered.
- Yeah.

40:25.589 --> 40:28.183
All right, all right.
Well, then let's get to work.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.420
<i>Toby, hack into</i>
<i>the insurance database...</i>

40:30.494 --> 40:32.428
<i>and find as many cars</i>
<i>as you can.</i>

40:32.496 --> 40:36.626
<i>Yes! I got addresses</i>
<i>on Hillary, Natalie and Tracy.</i>

40:36.700 --> 40:40.192
<i>Donny, check the D.M.V.For</i>
<i>the remaining cars on the list.</i>

40:40.271 --> 40:42.535
<i>I'm sorry, miss, but you've</i>
<i>missed five questions.</i>

40:42.606 --> 40:45.632
- <i>That's a failing.</i>
- No!

40:45.709 --> 40:48.075
- <i>Next.</i>
- No! Why?

40:48.145 --> 40:51.171
You're supposed to go faster
when somebody tailgates you.

40:51.248 --> 40:53.182
- Ah. Hello again.
- <i>Mm-hmm. Here's your list...</i>

40:53.250 --> 40:56.185
of the 20 car owners' names and
addresses that you requested.

40:56.253 --> 40:58.448
- Thank you.
- That's $100, please.

40:58.522 --> 41:01.218
- A hundred dollars?
- Well, five dollars a car.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.726
Twenty cars.
Would you like a calculator?

41:03.794 --> 41:06.991
It used to be two dollars a car.
Thanks a lot.

41:07.064 --> 41:11.125
My name's Roger, sir.
May I be of some help?

41:13.204 --> 41:16.605
That's funny, my name's Roger.
Two Rogers don't make a right.

41:16.674 --> 41:19.609
- Roger, I have a problem.
- Yes?

41:19.677 --> 41:22.646
I've been in L.A. For three months now.
I have money, I have taste.

41:22.713 --> 41:24.840
But I'm not
on anybody's "A" list,

41:24.915 --> 41:27.850
and Saturday night is the
loneliest night of the week for me.

41:27.918 --> 41:31.012
- Oh. A Ferrari would certainly change that.
- Perhaps. Mmm.

41:31.088 --> 41:34.023
But, you know, this is the one.
Yes, yes, yes.

41:34.091 --> 41:37.857
I saw three of these parked outside
the local Starbucks this morning,

41:37.928 --> 41:39.862
which tells me
only one thing.

41:39.930 --> 41:44.230
There's too many self-indulgent wieners
in this city with too much bloody money!

41:44.301 --> 41:47.236
Now, if I was driving...

41:47.304 --> 41:51.673
a 1967275 GTB four-cam...

41:51.742 --> 41:54.677
You would not be
a self-indulgent weiner, sir.

41:54.745 --> 41:57.179
- You'd be a connoisseur.
- Precisely.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.443
Champagne would fall
from the heavens.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.350
Doors would open.
Velvet ropes would part.

42:02.419 --> 42:04.717
I don't have one here,

42:04.788 --> 42:07.382
however I do have one
in the warehouse.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.392
Superb.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.553
What else do you have
in the warehouse?

42:11.695 --> 42:15.153
<i>Mm-hmm. All right.</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

42:17.034 --> 42:19.127
That was Mr. Lakewood
from the dealership.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.433
<i>He says that boxer-looking punk</i>
<i>is gonna pick up the keys...</i>

42:21.505 --> 42:23.700
to three new Mercedes today.

42:23.774 --> 42:26.572
Same make and models
as the ones we already got impounded.

42:26.644 --> 42:31.274
Now we're talkin'.

42:31.348 --> 42:34.215
The <i>El Spirito</i>
<i>de Graciela...</i>

42:34.285 --> 42:38.244
sails Friday,
8:00 a.m. Sharp.

42:38.322 --> 42:41.814
We'll target all the cars
within 45 minutes of here.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.952
<i>By the time their alarm</i>
<i>tracking systems are activated,</i>

42:45.029 --> 42:48.260
<i>the cars will already be</i>
<i>in these containers.</i>

42:56.173 --> 42:59.404
Fellas, this is Sway.

42:59.476 --> 43:02.001
No questions.
I'm here for Kip.

43:02.079 --> 43:04.172
- All right.
- <i>All right.</i>

43:20.397 --> 43:22.831
- It's me. He's here.
- The red Chevy Nova?

43:22.900 --> 43:25.835
That's affirmative, sir.

43:25.903 --> 43:29.339
As soon as he leaves, you call me
with the owners' addresses, all right?

43:29.406 --> 43:32.341
I'll get those forms
right over, sir.

43:32.409 --> 43:36.277
Damn boss.
Always on my case.

43:36.347 --> 43:39.111
- I got three here?
- Mm-hmm.

43:39.183 --> 43:41.413
Thank you.

43:52.563 --> 43:57.796
<i>Huh, Randall Raines,</i>
<i>Donny Astricky, Otto Halliwell.</i>

43:57.868 --> 43:59.961
Should I set up
some tails?

44:00.037 --> 44:02.130
Uh-uh. They're
too smart for that.

44:02.206 --> 44:04.299
They'll just
dump the cars.

44:04.375 --> 44:06.935
No, we'll get them
with the Mercedes.

44:07.011 --> 44:11.038
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance
teams at those addresses.

44:13.384 --> 44:16.046
You go ahead and you
make your move, man.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.850
And I will
be waiting for you.

44:24.061 --> 44:26.154
Why do you call 'em
girls' names?

44:26.230 --> 44:29.358
That's a good question.
Why <i>do</i> you call 'em girls' names?

44:29.433 --> 44:34.029
<i>It's code. You say Jane,</i>
<i>you say Shirley, Lucy, Edna,</i>

44:34.104 --> 44:37.767
and nobody listening
on the waves is the wiser.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.809
Got 'em.

44:44.515 --> 44:47.177
Okay.

44:47.251 --> 44:53.019
All right, we've got the addresses
on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.

44:58.162 --> 45:01.563
- There she is.
- Nice.

45:01.632 --> 45:04.567
Damn, it's cold up here!
They keep these Ferraris refrigerated?

45:04.635 --> 45:07.570
And you know black people don't like
cold weather! We're tropical people, man.

45:07.638 --> 45:10.004
When this is over,
I'm gonna smoke a joint,

45:10.074 --> 45:12.770
watch two hours of <i>Roots</i>,
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

45:12.843 --> 45:16.870
Hello, and welcome
to <i>TV Car Trivia.</i>

45:16.947 --> 45:20.542
First question: Who was
the driver of a '73 Firebird?

45:20.617 --> 45:23.108
- <i>Uh, Otto?</i>
- Uh, Jim Rockford, <i>Rockford Files</i>.

45:23.187 --> 45:25.712
Give me <i>Columbo</i>.

45:25.789 --> 45:27.984
- A Peugeot convertible.
- What color?

45:28.058 --> 45:30.492
- Grey.
- How'd you know that?

45:30.561 --> 45:32.529
'Cause I love that show.

45:32.596 --> 45:35.360
I got three words
for all of y'all. Get a life!

45:35.432 --> 45:37.798
Ah, this is some kiddie shit, Sphinx.

45:37.868 --> 45:40.666
What's on Magnum P.I.'s
license plate?

45:40.738 --> 45:42.672
<i>"Robin 1."</i>

45:42.740 --> 45:45.470
<i>Wait. Wasn't Robin that</i>
<i>faggoty guy who hung with him?</i>

45:45.542 --> 45:48.067
No, that was Higgins.
That was Higgins.

45:48.145 --> 45:50.170
Hey, hey, ten points
for our fearless leader.

45:50.247 --> 45:53.239
<i>Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor</i>
<i>of the Bill Bixby trifecta?</i>

45:56.754 --> 45:59.450
<i>He drove a Corvette in</i> The Magician<i>,</i>

45:59.523 --> 46:02.651
<i>A Ford pickup truck</i>
<i>in</i> The Incredible Hulk<i>,</i>

46:02.726 --> 46:06.423
<i>and in</i> The Courtship
of Eddie's Father<i>, he walked.</i>

46:11.368 --> 46:14.337
- Bingo.
- My man.

46:27.584 --> 46:30.417
<i>Al, tell me something.</i>

46:30.487 --> 46:32.853
Nothin' doing here, sir.
Nobody's showing.

46:32.923 --> 46:34.686
Copy.

46:34.758 --> 46:36.749
Minivan approaching.

46:36.827 --> 46:39.318
<i>It seems a little late</i>
<i>for soccer practice.</i>

46:42.032 --> 46:45.126
Heads up. I think we got
some activity right here.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.337
<i>Oh, that is...</i>
<i>Looks like it's Kip Raines,</i>

46:53.410 --> 46:55.537
<i>and we got a Randall Raines.</i>

46:55.612 --> 46:59.275
If they take this,
we will take them down.

46:59.349 --> 47:02.580
<i>He's pulling something</i>
<i>out of his pocket. You see that?</i>

47:02.653 --> 47:05.679
<i>It's a camera. Looks like</i>
<i>he's just doing some homework.</i>

47:05.756 --> 47:07.849
<i>All right,</i>
<i>let's leave him be.</i>

47:07.925 --> 47:10.723
I don't wanna burn this.
They will be back.

47:12.563 --> 47:15.361
<i>Huh.</i>

47:15.432 --> 47:18.333
You know what? Let's go over
to Otto's in the morning.

47:18.402 --> 47:21.894
Kick over some rocks,
see what's underneath there.

47:21.972 --> 47:24.600
We saved the best for last.

47:24.675 --> 47:28.202
The '67 Shelby Mustang GT-500.

47:28.278 --> 47:31.770
- The GT-500?
- Yeah, yeah.

47:35.285 --> 47:38.152
There she is.

47:38.222 --> 47:42.022
<i>Yep, there's Eleanor.</i>

47:43.493 --> 47:46.223
Eleanor is Memphis's unicorn.

47:46.296 --> 47:49.026
- What's a unicorn?
- Fabled creature.

47:49.099 --> 47:52.933
You know, the horse with the horn,
impossible to capture.

47:53.003 --> 47:56.871
<i>It's the one car, no matter how many times
you try to boost, something always happens.</i>

48:00.777 --> 48:05.373
We're gonna get through this this time,
right? It's gonna be smooth...

48:05.449 --> 48:07.644
- What's he doing?
- <i>And easy.</i>

48:07.718 --> 48:11.449
He's talkin' to her, man.
Tryin' to get reacquainted.

48:11.521 --> 48:15.321
<i>Done had a rough history. She almost</i>
<i>got him killed a couple of times.</i>

48:15.392 --> 48:18.122
- I don't want any talking back.
- <i>He flipped one on the Harbor freeway.</i>

48:18.195 --> 48:20.425
He went off
the Long Beach pier once.

48:20.497 --> 48:22.931
A smooth, easy ride.

48:24.534 --> 48:26.502
We're just gonna glide.

48:29.206 --> 48:32.334
Big night tomorrow, guys.
Let's go home.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.474
- Did you... Did you get the picture?
- Yeah.

48:36.546 --> 48:40.312
See you tomorrow night,
Eleanor, with your fine ass.

48:42.886 --> 48:47.152
Man, we're almost home.
You wanna get something to eat?

48:47.224 --> 48:49.658
<i>I'd like to get</i>
<i>a chocolate malt.</i>

49:01.438 --> 49:04.168
- Hey!
- Get out of the car!

49:04.241 --> 49:06.539
Go, go, go, go, go!

49:09.947 --> 49:12.381
Why are people shooting at us?

49:12.449 --> 49:15.384
'Cause I blew up their car!

49:35.706 --> 49:37.970
Over here!

49:43.313 --> 49:45.804
"Beast."

49:45.882 --> 49:48.407
Okay, okay.

49:52.155 --> 49:55.090
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

49:55.158 --> 49:57.888
Hey!

50:05.435 --> 50:09.531
Oh!

50:39.936 --> 50:42.666
<i>Oh, you...</i>
<i>you think it's a game?</i>

50:42.739 --> 50:45.765
Johnny B.
Cops, man.

50:45.842 --> 50:48.811
<i>I ain't got nothin' but time, baby.</i>

50:59.723 --> 51:02.749
Oh, man, we're gonna
be here all night, man.

51:04.227 --> 51:07.321
Look! Cop car! Uh-huh.

51:07.397 --> 51:12.266
Long as I'm in here, you're just gonna
sit out there, aren't ya? Aye?

51:14.905 --> 51:17.499
Hey, listen,
this is the plan.

51:17.574 --> 51:20.168
This is what we're gonna do.
There's a big rig over there.

51:23.547 --> 51:27.506
Uh, mister, is that your truck
out there, the Big Rig Wrecker?

51:27.584 --> 51:29.552
- Big Rig Wrecker's mine.
- That's cool.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.602
What do I gotta do?
How do I learn? Where do I go?

51:46.670 --> 51:48.900
- Well, you gotta go to truck drivin' school.
- Truck dri...

51:48.972 --> 51:51.634
I know, man. I know.
But I mean like, um... -

51:51.708 --> 51:56.202
- You boys ready to play
a little pin the tail on the donkey?

51:56.279 --> 51:59.112
- Can I get you a jelly donut or something, man?
- No, I'm just gonna go.

51:59.182 --> 52:03.016
- 'Cause I'm gonna have a waffle.
- Maybe next time, though.

52:22.372 --> 52:26.240
I'm gonna smoke you!

52:39.723 --> 52:42.055
What the hell's going on?

52:43.760 --> 52:46.092
Want some of this?

52:46.163 --> 52:48.097
Yeah.

52:51.101 --> 52:53.831
- You guys got permits for these weapons?
- Oh, man!

53:12.522 --> 53:16.856
So you think I can only
get pizzas, huh? Boosted it myself.

53:16.927 --> 53:19.521
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How'd you get it?

53:19.596 --> 53:22.895
- Actually, the keys were in it.
- <i>Oh, well, that kind of defies the point then, don't it?</i>

53:22.966 --> 53:25.491
You stole a car
that wasn't on the list.

53:25.569 --> 53:28.231
You stole a car
that wasn't on the list!

53:28.305 --> 53:31.172
Why didn't you just go to the
police station in a red clown suit...

53:31.241 --> 53:33.175
and let everybody know
what we're doin' here?

53:33.243 --> 53:37.509
- What have we got?
- I don't know.

53:37.581 --> 53:39.378
Shit! Fellas.

53:39.449 --> 53:41.644
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Gimme that.</i>
- <i>Check this out.</i>

53:41.718 --> 53:45.620
- Check this out!
- Let me see that. This looks like heroin.

53:45.689 --> 53:47.816
- Yeah. -
What! - Exactly.

53:50.026 --> 53:52.688
- Where did you get this car?
- I n front of some poker parlor in Chinatown.

53:52.762 --> 53:54.787
Did you ever consider why a car
in a neighborhood like that...

53:54.864 --> 53:56.855
- <i>would have its keys left in it?</i>
- No.

53:56.933 --> 53:59.800
Maybe because nobody in that neighborhood
would be stupid enough to rip this car off.

53:59.869 --> 54:02.463
- All right. Get this shit outta here. Take it back.
- No, no. We can't take it back.

54:02.539 --> 54:04.302
- Get it outta here!
- Will everybody relax for a second?

54:04.374 --> 54:07.775
Take it back!

54:10.614 --> 54:12.343
I'm comin' after that shit.
Gimme that.

54:12.415 --> 54:16.112
No!

54:16.186 --> 54:18.916
Man, I will knock the shit out of you.

54:18.989 --> 54:22.117
- <i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>
- Who is it?

54:22.192 --> 54:25.559
- Detective Castlebeck.
- Oh. Christ.

54:38.975 --> 54:41.307
Goddamn it.

54:41.378 --> 54:45.474
- Hey, hello, Otto.
- Detective. Good to see you.

54:45.548 --> 54:48.847
- <i>Long time.</i>
- <i>Yeah. You're lookin' good.</i>

54:48.918 --> 54:51.318
Thank you.

54:51.388 --> 54:53.652
So Randall,
what do we got here?

54:53.723 --> 54:56.851
We got a multigenerational
gathering of players?

54:56.926 --> 54:58.553
- <i>Is that what we got here?</i>
- Right.

54:58.628 --> 55:00.994
Here's Donny.

55:01.064 --> 55:03.862
- How you been, D?
- I'm just happy to see you, brother.

55:03.933 --> 55:09.303
Yeah. I gotta tell you, Randall.
Seeing you here, Otto, Donny,

55:09.372 --> 55:11.533
makes me feel
almost nostalgic.

55:11.608 --> 55:14.236
Kind of like
a big reunion.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.677
You should stick around,
'cause a little later we're gonna...

55:16.746 --> 55:19.510
make s'mores
and sing "Kumbayah."

55:21.918 --> 55:25.479
- What is this?
- What? They call this a Cadillac.

55:25.555 --> 55:28.046
Yeah.

55:28.124 --> 55:29.751
- What's wrong with it, Otto?
- Rest...

55:29.826 --> 55:32.090
- <i>Needs restoration.</i>
- What?

55:32.162 --> 55:34.858
- Brightening.
- Otto.

55:34.931 --> 55:38.196
- You got a '39 Ford right there.
- That's a pretty car.

55:38.268 --> 55:41.897
- Isn't that a nice car?
- Yeah. Right here you got a '53 Fiat Vignale.

55:41.971 --> 55:46.374
<i>Now, these are beautiful cars, Otto.</i>
<i>And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado.</i>

55:46.443 --> 55:49.003
- Yeah.
- I mean, who the hell pays...

55:49.079 --> 55:52.310
to brighten up
a Cadillac Eldorado?

55:52.382 --> 55:55.783
I think it holds a certain
sentimental value, you know.

55:55.852 --> 55:58.446
<i>Nothing more.</i>

56:00.056 --> 56:02.149
Run me down a tag.

56:04.861 --> 56:08.490
License 3-2-9-H-R-O.

56:08.565 --> 56:12.592
That is Harold, Randall, Otto,
burgundy Cadillac.

56:18.141 --> 56:21.770
No faith in our newfound
goodness, Detective? Huh?

56:21.845 --> 56:25.281
Task force runs on statistics
and numbers, Otto. You know that.

56:25.348 --> 56:28.579
- <i>Randall, this Kip?</i>
- That's my brother.

56:28.651 --> 56:31.051
He's all grown up.

56:31.121 --> 56:33.112
<i>One-Baker-eleven, Pacific Division...</i>

56:33.189 --> 56:35.657
<i>three-two-niner,</i>
<i>Harold, Randall, Otto.</i>

56:35.725 --> 56:40.059
<i>No wants, no warrants at this time.</i>
<i>D.M.V.Not on file.</i>

56:40.130 --> 56:42.257
Copy that.
Thank you.

56:42.332 --> 56:44.562
See, I know what you're doin'.
I know.

56:44.634 --> 56:48.263
You're thinkin' there's no want,
but that I stripped its guts...

56:48.338 --> 56:50.465
and crated her up, right?

56:50.540 --> 56:52.565
Is that what you did,
Randall?

56:52.642 --> 56:55.440
No. I didn't do it. You know, you're
trying to hurt my feelings? Fine.

56:55.512 --> 56:57.446
You know what? Go ahead.
Do it. Let her rip.

56:57.514 --> 57:00.540
- Go ahead, rev it up.
- All right, goddamn it. I will.

57:00.617 --> 57:02.676
Sell it to you cheap.

57:02.752 --> 57:05.915
Yeah. '83. First year they
put the auto-ride control on these boys.

57:05.989 --> 57:09.652
Oh, I don't know. You probably know
more about cars at this point than I do.

57:09.726 --> 57:13.685
- You slippin' on me, Randall?
- No, it's just your knowledge overwhelms me.

57:13.763 --> 57:16.994
- It's got a real nice-sounding engine.
Right, Otto? - Four point one liter.

57:17.066 --> 57:19.864
- Digital fuel injection?
- You got it. You're the man.

57:25.241 --> 57:29.007
Give it some more.
Give it some more.

57:29.078 --> 57:31.342
- Yeah, that's it!
- Go, go!

57:33.550 --> 57:36.110
Baby, don't be so mean!
Yeah, that's it!

57:38.721 --> 57:42.350
- <i>Oh, that was good.</i>
- Yeah, you break it, you buy it, my friend.

57:42.425 --> 57:46.486
<i>Yeah, she got some power goin' on.</i>

57:46.563 --> 57:50.363
All right.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.237
I'll catch you later.

58:11.955 --> 58:13.889
- It's on for tonight.
- How do you know?

58:16.292 --> 58:19.455
They got the call signs
on all the units working tonight.

58:22.031 --> 58:25.262
- Wh-What were you gonna do with this?
- I was gonna bonk him.

58:25.335 --> 58:28.065
Bonk?
For the next 24 hours,

58:28.137 --> 58:31.265
all your decision-making
privileges have been removed!

58:31.341 --> 58:33.571
- <i>You got it?</i> - Got
it. - Yeah, that's cool.

58:33.643 --> 58:36.476
Obviously they're onto us.
He's sniffin' real close.

58:36.546 --> 58:39.140
If anything tonight
appears out of place,

58:39.215 --> 58:41.683
I want you to cut bait,
get out of there and walk away.

58:41.751 --> 58:44.049
And get rid of this
goddamn car!

58:46.689 --> 58:49.817
- What's up, Kip?
- Bobby, what are you doin'?

58:49.893 --> 58:51.952
You think you're comin'
with us, but you're not.

58:52.028 --> 58:54.053
What are you talkin' about, man?
I'm part of the team. I get to go.

58:54.130 --> 58:58.999
No, no, wake up. Gonna end up in the jail
or the morgue or some shit. Don't be stupid.

58:59.068 --> 59:01.229
What am I supposed to do?

59:01.304 --> 59:03.636
Did you see a box
of rubber gloves here, man?

59:03.706 --> 59:08.473
Gloves? Man, you don't need gloves.
This is the new age. Check this out.

59:08.545 --> 59:11.639
- What is this?
- Let me just see that big claw you call a hand.

59:13.249 --> 59:15.080
That's not doughnut jelly,
so don't eat it.

59:15.151 --> 59:18.678
Your new fingerprints.
Elvis is back.

59:18.755 --> 59:20.586
Hmm.

59:20.657 --> 59:24.093
- Boy got skills, right?
- Yeah, you do.

59:25.328 --> 59:27.296
Look like a little
ghetto Smurf.

59:45.949 --> 59:50.113
I am a bad man.

59:57.927 --> 1:00:00.521
Thanks.
Thanks for doin' this.

1:00:03.032 --> 1:00:05.762
Keep it real.
Think slow.

1:00:06.903 --> 1:00:08.837
We should get through it
just fine.

1:00:11.341 --> 1:00:15.402
"Low Rider," Donny. Donny?
"Low Rider."

1:00:42.639 --> 1:00:44.573
Okay, let's ride.

1:00:59.088 --> 1:01:01.488
Oh! Shit.

1:01:05.895 --> 1:01:08.455
Gimme that torch. Aha!

1:01:10.033 --> 1:01:13.025
I tell you, I'm the man.
Now, where does this go?

1:01:13.102 --> 1:01:15.764
Find a way to get in here.
Get this...

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:20.775
I tell you, I'm runnin' this shit!
You do that again, I will kick...

1:01:20.843 --> 1:01:23.277
Cool, man. You don't have
to take it so damn personal.

1:01:25.148 --> 1:01:27.878
Ah. Everything is perfect.

1:01:40.897 --> 1:01:45.630
Hello, ladies. Always was
a sucker for a redhead.

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:49.729
Let's go. Come on, move, move!
Go, go!

1:01:52.542 --> 1:01:55.511
Work your magic, baby. I know
you know Ferraris. Work your magic.

1:01:55.578 --> 1:01:57.739
- <i>Girl got skill.</i>

1:02:22.472 --> 1:02:25.441
You all right?

1:02:27.944 --> 1:02:31.311
- You think we're gonna make it?
- I don't know. It's too early to tell.

1:02:56.139 --> 1:02:59.973
<i>Diana, Tricia,</i>
<i>Nadine and Rose are on their way.</i>

1:03:00.042 --> 1:03:01.976
Good goin', guys.

1:03:21.931 --> 1:03:23.865
Al, tell me something.

1:03:23.933 --> 1:03:28.393
Unit two. Sorry, sir.
Nothing yet.

1:03:28.471 --> 1:03:30.735
Son of a bitch.

1:03:30.807 --> 1:03:33.970
I know you're not parking
right in front of me.

1:03:34.043 --> 1:03:36.204
Oh, no. I can't see
a damn thing.

1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:39.339
All right.
We gotta move.

1:03:54.463 --> 1:03:57.261
<i>You ever feel bad</i>
<i>about any of this?</i>

1:03:57.333 --> 1:04:01.736
Hell, no. I'm Robin Hood, man. I rob
from the rich and give to the needy.

1:04:01.804 --> 1:04:05.103
Damn. Donny!

1:04:05.174 --> 1:04:07.768
I got you.
I got you.

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:10.677
- You mean the poor.
- Cutters.

1:04:10.746 --> 1:04:12.680
Cutters.

1:04:12.748 --> 1:04:14.613
No, like I said, the needy.

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:19.545
'Cause, brother,
we need this car.

1:04:27.096 --> 1:04:30.293
- What's up, Doc?
- You're new, aren't ya?

1:04:30.366 --> 1:04:34.496
- Yeah. How can you tell?
- Now, listen, son. You take real good care of this car,

1:04:34.570 --> 1:04:37.471
and I'll take care of you.

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:40.065
Tell you what. Save it. You get
another one of these suits, all right?

1:04:40.142 --> 1:04:43.043
- God bless you, son.
- You need a fashion counselor.

1:04:43.112 --> 1:04:46.309
All right, babe. I ain't here for the door.
I here for the car. Get your big ass out.

1:04:46.382 --> 1:04:48.782
- Hmm?
- Out! What are you lookin' at?

1:04:51.687 --> 1:04:55.123
- Hey, man, that was as easy as pie.
- I'm a veteran, son.

1:04:55.191 --> 1:04:57.250
Get outta the car, bitch,
or I'll blow your brains out!

1:04:57.326 --> 1:05:00.625
- You gotta be shittin' me.
- I will shoot you, damn it!

1:05:00.696 --> 1:05:02.561
Damn!

1:05:02.632 --> 1:05:07.296
You lazy, half-ass bully!
Any asshole can pull a gun on somebody!

1:05:07.370 --> 1:05:10.771
You don't know the first thing
about stealin' a car! Boy, I...

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:14.105
You need a role model!

1:05:15.544 --> 1:05:17.842
Stacy.

1:05:41.148 --> 1:05:43.946
Shannon.

1:05:58.966 --> 1:06:01.457
Laura.

1:06:04.638 --> 1:06:07.471
Lindsay.

1:06:07.541 --> 1:06:09.065
Rachel.

1:06:20.254 --> 1:06:23.246
<i>Hey. Check this out.</i>

1:06:32.599 --> 1:06:36.035
J.J., he's back. But he's smart.
He watches his ass.

1:06:36.103 --> 1:06:38.765
<i>Just hold our positions.</i>
<i>If he rolls,</i>

1:06:38.839 --> 1:06:40.864
- <i>you follow him out.</i>
- Copy that.

1:06:50.384 --> 1:06:53.547
<i>What's he doin'?</i>
<i>What... What are you doing?</i>

1:07:01.061 --> 1:07:05.225
<i>We might as well roll down</i>
<i>our windows and wave.</i>

1:07:05.299 --> 1:07:06.960
- J.J., you tail him. All right?
- <i>Copy that.</i>

1:07:11.805 --> 1:07:13.864
Let's go.

1:07:17.411 --> 1:07:20.539
- Good luck.
- Piece of cake.

1:07:23.884 --> 1:07:27.843
Unit one, this is unit two.
Astricky has landed.

1:07:27.921 --> 1:07:29.946
<i>If they roll, we take them down.</i>

1:07:32.159 --> 1:07:36.528
Last night that van was parked
four houses down. Now it's only two.

1:07:37.564 --> 1:07:41.000
- We got company.
- Shit.

1:07:41.068 --> 1:07:43.195
He's at the car.

1:07:45.305 --> 1:07:48.103
<i>Bird, come back.</i>

1:07:49.176 --> 1:07:52.236
- Stand by, unit one.
- What?

1:07:52.312 --> 1:07:54.439
- Where are you?
- Where do you think I am?

1:07:54.515 --> 1:07:57.450
I'm at the casino, picking up
pit boss's lady. What do you want?

1:07:57.518 --> 1:08:01.648
- The ladies are dirty. Walk away. The ladies are dirty.
- What?

1:08:01.722 --> 1:08:04.384
I want everybody to get back
to the garage now.

1:08:04.458 --> 1:08:07.393
Oh, so she's havin'
a baby right now?

1:08:07.461 --> 1:08:09.520
I guess I better get
to the hospital then, huh?

1:08:09.596 --> 1:08:11.291
Something's got him spooked.

1:08:11.365 --> 1:08:14.061
My wife is havin' a baby.
Gotta get...

1:08:14.134 --> 1:08:16.728
I'm nervous! This ain't even my car!
Way over here...

1:08:18.038 --> 1:08:19.972
He's heading away
from the vehicle.

1:08:21.875 --> 1:08:24.139
I see you.

1:08:29.716 --> 1:08:32.150
Pull in over there.

1:08:45.165 --> 1:08:49.067
- Hello.
This is unit two. I lost them.

1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:56.438
<i>All right, it's time</i>
<i>to talk to Fuzzy again.</i>

1:08:58.212 --> 1:09:01.579
<i>Check this out. Laser-encoded keys
that send a message to a receiver...</i>

1:09:01.648 --> 1:09:03.377
inside the car.

1:09:03.450 --> 1:09:05.941
You wanna tell me
what you're doin' with these?

1:09:06.019 --> 1:09:08.852
Yeah. These are from last week.
These are from the other boost.

1:09:15.662 --> 1:09:18.460
Who is it?

1:09:19.833 --> 1:09:24.167
- <i>The keys, the keys, the keys!</i>
- <i>Take it easy!</i>

1:09:24.238 --> 1:09:26.263
- <i>Now gimme this!</i>
- What happened? What happened?

1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:28.467
- Where'd you get these from?
- <i>What's the problem?</i>

1:09:28.542 --> 1:09:31.477
The Mercedes are dirty!
There's surveillance vans all over them.

1:09:31.545 --> 1:09:34.946
- Where'd they come from?
- Whoa. My guy in Southland. The same guy I used last time.

1:09:35.015 --> 1:09:37.210
- Same guy I used before.
- Before when?

1:09:37.284 --> 1:09:39.912
- When we... When we took the other cars.
- Other Mercedes.

1:09:39.987 --> 1:09:43.286
- Christ.
- Castlebeck.

1:09:43.357 --> 1:09:46.656
He got to one of the guys at the dealership,
and he turned him. That's what happened.

1:09:46.727 --> 1:09:49.491
Eight hours left.

1:09:49.563 --> 1:09:53.090
So what, we're gonna stand around and
have a meeting? Wh-What's goin' on?

1:09:53.166 --> 1:09:57.068
Memphis, maybe it's time for us
to start thinking about...

1:09:57.137 --> 1:10:01.130
- how to get these young kids
out of town, 'cause...

1:10:01.208 --> 1:10:05.611
If there's no Mercedes, there's no point
in boosting any other cars. You hear me?

1:10:05.679 --> 1:10:09.410
- That's it.
- 47 is not 50, Memphis. You know that's what he'll say.

1:10:09.483 --> 1:10:11.417
Yeah.

1:10:11.485 --> 1:10:15.751
<i>Hey, Memphis. You know, we still have</i>
<i>the Mercedes keys from the last boost.</i>

1:10:15.822 --> 1:10:20.316
Hey! Those cars are
at the police impound.

1:10:20.394 --> 1:10:23.386
Okay? The police impound. You want
us to go there and start stealin' cars?

1:10:23.463 --> 1:10:26.432
- Yeah. - Yeah, let's do
it. - <i>You're crazy.</i>

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:30.937
- We're gonna get hectic. Let's go.
- No, Memphis, no. Don't do this.

1:10:31.004 --> 1:10:32.995
Hey, Sphinx, I don't look
suspicious, do I, man?

1:10:33.073 --> 1:10:36.440
<i>Otto, man, I think that</i>
<i>your dog ate the keys.</i>

1:10:36.510 --> 1:10:39.843
He usually goes for the license plates.

1:10:39.913 --> 1:10:44.145
- Are you sure?
- What? Wait a minute. The dog ate the keys?

1:10:44.217 --> 1:10:47.948
- Yes.
How you gonna get them out?

1:10:48.021 --> 1:10:49.852
- Not funny.
- I'm...

1:10:49.923 --> 1:10:52.357
- Hey, hey, don't even
think about it, Sphinx.

1:10:52.426 --> 1:10:54.690
It's all right.

1:10:54.761 --> 1:10:58.162
Say, uh, Toby,

1:10:58.231 --> 1:11:02.531
go see if you can get some,
uh, Alpo, and get some Ex-lax.

1:11:02.602 --> 1:11:05.070
- No way, man.
- Bad dog!

1:11:05.138 --> 1:11:07.629
- <i>Let's get back to work.</i>

1:11:22.522 --> 1:11:25.719
Hey! Open the door.

1:11:25.792 --> 1:11:28.192
- <i>Ah, Jesus.</i>
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

1:11:28.261 --> 1:11:30.729
- End it, rock star. Get in.
- Jesus Christ.

1:11:30.797 --> 1:11:34.824
Now what, man?
What else?

1:11:34.901 --> 1:11:38.302
Fuzzy, you never called me.
So now we gotta stay down here...

1:11:38.372 --> 1:11:40.533
till you tell me everything
you know.

1:11:40.607 --> 1:11:42.973
I... I told you everything I know.
I know that,

1:11:43.043 --> 1:11:45.068
because I said,
"This is everything I know."

1:11:45.145 --> 1:11:49.741
Detective Drycoff, does it seem like the
suspect is violating his parole right now?

1:11:49.816 --> 1:11:52.683
<i>Why, yes, Detective Castlebeck,</i>
<i>if by violating his parole...</i>

1:11:52.753 --> 1:11:55.313
you mean failing to cooperate
with a law enforcement officer.

1:12:01.495 --> 1:12:04.157
A little trick I learned in
the car thief retirement home.

1:12:05.265 --> 1:12:06.789
Can you hold this?

1:12:06.867 --> 1:12:10.200
No, no, no. I'm not failing
to cooperate. It's just that...

1:12:10.270 --> 1:12:13.398
Y-Y-Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Uh, word has it...

1:12:13.473 --> 1:12:18.240
that Kip Raines took the job and he
screwed up. Uh, he screwed up pretty bad.

1:12:18.311 --> 1:12:20.506
And who put out
the order for the job?

1:12:23.383 --> 1:12:25.317
It's Raymond Calitri's order.

1:12:25.385 --> 1:12:27.580
<i>Nice.</i>

1:12:33.994 --> 1:12:35.825
<i>Come on, come on,</i>
<i>come on, come on.</i>

1:12:35.896 --> 1:12:39.696
Yes.

1:12:42.969 --> 1:12:45.836
<i>We have six hours left.</i>
<i>Has the dog done its business yet?</i>

1:12:45.906 --> 1:12:47.840
Toby and Freb
are walking him right now.

1:12:47.908 --> 1:12:51.571
- He's not gonna go it.
It's not gonna happen, man.

1:12:51.645 --> 1:12:56.241
Come on, dog.
What's wrong, Hemi? Poop, dog.

1:12:58.885 --> 1:13:03.618
- It had to be a girl car.
- Girl car, what kind of a girl drives a Hemi 'Cuda?

1:13:03.690 --> 1:13:06.591
I'll show you.

1:13:06.660 --> 1:13:09.356
Lipstick?

1:13:09.429 --> 1:13:13.092
Matches the car.

1:13:13.166 --> 1:13:17.193
- What's next? Blush? Mascara?
- <i>Next time...</i>

1:13:17.270 --> 1:13:21.730
I'll pull out the, uh, leather and
high heels and pink underwear for you.

1:13:21.808 --> 1:13:24.641
- Leather, high heels and pink underwear.
- Pink underwear.

1:13:24.711 --> 1:13:27.271
- Pink underwear works.
Pink underwear works.

1:13:30.283 --> 1:13:35.050
<i>Raymond Vincent Calitri did five years</i>
<i>in South London for manslaughter.</i>

1:13:35.121 --> 1:13:37.589
- He immigrated in '98.
- Look at this.

1:13:37.657 --> 1:13:42.458
Loan shark and extortion, fencing. Ha.
His front's a salvage yard.

1:14:01.448 --> 1:14:03.712
Gonna have to
wait it out.

1:14:05.452 --> 1:14:09.513
So, you seeing anybody?

1:14:09.589 --> 1:14:13.548
No. No, I had
a girl once.

1:14:13.627 --> 1:14:19.122
- She was great.
- Mmm. So if she was so great, why'd you leave her?

1:14:39.686 --> 1:14:41.881
I did ask you
to come with me.

1:14:43.490 --> 1:14:47.119
No, you asked me
to be a different person.

1:14:47.193 --> 1:14:52.688
I didn't want to see people get hurt.
I just wanted you to slow down.

1:14:52.766 --> 1:14:55.200
Well, I couldn't.

1:14:55.268 --> 1:14:57.202
'Cause I wasn't ready.

1:14:58.672 --> 1:15:00.970
- You're straight now.
- Yeah, I am.

1:15:01.041 --> 1:15:02.941
'Cause it wasn't the same
without you.

1:15:09.215 --> 1:15:12.150
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Hey, asshole. I was reading that.

1:15:12.218 --> 1:15:14.152
- Watch your mouth, kid.
- What's goin' on?

1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:16.780
- This is a homicide file from a homicide investigation.
- <i>All right.</i>

1:15:16.856 --> 1:15:19.518
It took us three months to get a
magistrate to give us a wiretap on 'em.

1:15:19.593 --> 1:15:24.997
<i>No other division, including GRAB, can go near
his person, residence or place of business.</i>

1:15:25.065 --> 1:15:27.499
All right? Got it?
Let me tell you guys something.

1:15:27.567 --> 1:15:32.334
All right. Raymond Calitri
is going down for murder one. Boneheads.

1:15:32.405 --> 1:15:36.171
Who gives a shit
about grand theft auto? Really.

1:15:37.577 --> 1:15:39.738
<i>I can't watch this.</i>

1:15:39.813 --> 1:15:42.907
Come on, come on, come on.
Get it on. Get it over with.

1:15:48.021 --> 1:15:52.856
What do you think is more
exciting, having sex, or stealing cars?

1:15:52.926 --> 1:15:55.019
Having sex or boosting cars?

1:15:55.095 --> 1:15:57.529
<i>Um. Ooh!</i>

1:15:57.597 --> 1:15:59.531
Uh.

1:16:03.036 --> 1:16:06.199
<i>Well, uh, how about, uh...</i>

1:16:06.272 --> 1:16:09.799
<i>having sex</i>
<i>while boosting cars?</i>

1:16:09.876 --> 1:16:12.242
God, that's
a good line.

1:16:12.312 --> 1:16:16.874
<i>Oh, doesn't work on</i>
<i>a lot of girls, though.</i>

1:16:16.950 --> 1:16:19.248
I just blurted it out.
I'm s...

1:16:21.121 --> 1:16:23.885
But you haven't
answered the question.

1:16:23.957 --> 1:16:27.051
Well, you see,
the problem is,

1:16:27.127 --> 1:16:29.220
how do you get over
the shifter?

1:16:29.295 --> 1:16:33.095
- Oh. Oh, right. 'Cause the, uh...
- Because it gets in the way.

1:16:33.166 --> 1:16:39.071
Because you wouldn't want to disrupt
the, uh, synchromesh. Right?

1:16:39.139 --> 1:16:41.573
Or the throttle linkage.

1:16:47.747 --> 1:16:50.511
The clutch master cylinder.

1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:56.413
Double overhead cam shaft.

1:16:56.489 --> 1:17:02.086
- I can't do this.
- Wait, wait. Just straight in-line six,

1:17:02.162 --> 1:17:03.891
triple Weber carburetors...

1:17:03.963 --> 1:17:07.399
<i>Bolted to each other's</i>
<i>body structures.</i>

1:17:10.503 --> 1:17:12.437
Oh, it's time to work.

1:17:12.505 --> 1:17:16.498
Good brakes.
Good brakes too.

1:17:30.423 --> 1:17:34.291
- There's nothin' happening.
- Maybe he's got indigestion.

1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:37.761
- Well, dude, we'll give him some
more Ex-lax. - He already ate two.

1:17:37.831 --> 1:17:39.594
- <i>Hey, little man.</i>
- Oh, man.

1:17:39.666 --> 1:17:45.036
I thought I told you this is our turf.
What, you wanna make a move?

1:17:45.105 --> 1:17:47.039
We don't want anything
to do with your turf.

1:17:47.107 --> 1:17:49.007
<i>Something wrong with</i>
<i>where we live?</i>

1:17:49.075 --> 1:17:51.669
Oh, no, it's cool for you.
I mean, it's just not for us.

1:17:51.745 --> 1:17:54.873
Oh, so now you think you're
better than us or something, huh?

1:17:54.948 --> 1:17:57.644
- <i>Maybe we should cut you up, doll?</i>
- Um...

1:17:57.717 --> 1:18:02.245
- Dude, the keys. Freb.
- Excuse me a second, guys.

1:18:02.322 --> 1:18:05.883
<i>Man!</i>

1:18:05.959 --> 1:18:09.053
- Aw, I'm gonna throw up, dog!
- Man, that's disgusting.

1:18:09.129 --> 1:18:12.394
What kind of pervert gets their jollies
off playing with dog shit?

1:18:12.465 --> 1:18:14.990
Look, man! I got 'em.
All three, man.

1:18:15.068 --> 1:18:17.662
- You guys are sick.
- I got 'em!

1:18:30.316 --> 1:18:32.841
Wake up, man.
Check this out.

1:18:32.919 --> 1:18:36.355
Every time I drive my Volvo
in Beverly Hills, they tow the shit.

1:18:45.765 --> 1:18:49.724
- We ain't got any Volvos here.
- There is a Volvo here. I know.

1:18:49.803 --> 1:18:51.270
- They told me...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

1:18:51.337 --> 1:18:54.306
What I'm tryin' to tell you is,
there ain't no Volvos here.

1:19:00.647 --> 1:19:03.445
Then get in your book, do something.
Find my damn Volvo!

1:19:03.516 --> 1:19:06.451
Sphinx. Sway.

1:19:06.519 --> 1:19:08.851
It's got to be somewhere
in there. Check it out, man.

1:19:10.456 --> 1:19:12.720
Wait, wait.
There's nothing here. Look.

1:19:12.792 --> 1:19:17.058
- There's another one... - No, no!
Uh-uh, hey! Tell you what, look at this.

1:19:17.130 --> 1:19:20.657
Look at her.

1:19:31.044 --> 1:19:33.512
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I don't</i>
<i>even need to be out here.</i>

1:19:33.580 --> 1:19:36.549
Hey, uh... I got a midget
pagin' me right now.

1:19:36.616 --> 1:19:38.777
- Wait...
- I gotta get outta here. Hey, time is money.

1:19:38.918 --> 1:19:43.048
This is the worst damn day of my life.

1:19:48.027 --> 1:19:50.655
"Detective Castlebeck.
Glass shards...

1:19:50.730 --> 1:19:54.291
"from the warehouse
from a black light bulb...

1:19:54.367 --> 1:19:56.562
available at any
local hardware store."

1:19:59.172 --> 1:20:01.265
<i>All right.</i>

1:20:01.341 --> 1:20:04.333
What the hell is a black
light bulb doin' in a...

1:20:05.478 --> 1:20:07.412
warehouse in Long Beach?

1:20:12.685 --> 1:20:14.653
Come with me.

1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:23.094
- See this glass right here?
- Let me guess.

1:20:23.162 --> 1:20:26.598
- Black light?
- Black light.

1:20:26.666 --> 1:20:29.931
Take that wall.
I'll take this wall.

1:20:30.003 --> 1:20:34.133
- <i>Remember the seventies?</i>
- Too young, thank God.

1:20:34.207 --> 1:20:36.471
Black lights were
all the rage back then.

1:20:36.542 --> 1:20:40.137
You know, they had this ink,
these magic markers.

1:20:40.213 --> 1:20:42.272
Only show up
under black light.

1:20:42.348 --> 1:20:47.183
So if you got a whole lot of information
that you don't want anybody to have...

1:20:47.253 --> 1:20:52.190
- Like a shopping list of cars?
- There you go. Whoa!

1:20:52.258 --> 1:20:54.920
Yes. Yes!

1:20:54.994 --> 1:20:56.962
Here is our list.

1:20:57.030 --> 1:21:01.399
That's a big list.
We can't handle all these cars.

1:21:01.467 --> 1:21:05.631
Maybe we don't have to. I'd say where
let's concentrate on the rarest ones,

1:21:05.705 --> 1:21:08.367
and let's just hope
for some luck.

1:21:08.441 --> 1:21:11.638
Let's get somebody on this right here.
You and I will take this one right her.

1:21:11.711 --> 1:21:13.645
'67 Shelby Mustang.

1:21:13.713 --> 1:21:15.647
- Can't be but a few of these in town.
- Yeah.

1:21:15.715 --> 1:21:17.945
But how do you know
he hasn't already stolen it?

1:21:18.017 --> 1:21:20.645
Oh, if I know our boy, I believe
he'll leave this one till last.

1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:23.848
- Why?
- He's afraid of it.

1:21:35.902 --> 1:21:39.133
<i>Yo, guys.</i>
<i>It's me.</i>

1:21:39.205 --> 1:21:43.198
- Oh, man. What are you doing?
- I want to come along with you guys on a boost.

1:21:43.276 --> 1:21:46.268
Come on. Let's go.
Later. Come on.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.628
Go, go, go.

1:22:13.106 --> 1:22:16.906
What's the matter with you? Come on!

1:22:16.976 --> 1:22:19.444
<i>Hey, call security!</i>
<i>Someone's stealing the car!</i>

1:22:19.512 --> 1:22:21.707
- Go, go, go!
- What are you doing?

1:22:21.781 --> 1:22:25.342
Whoa. I ought to leave your ass. You
know that? What's the matter with you?

1:22:37.697 --> 1:22:41.599
Hey, Sphinx. Check this out. Home boy
got "Snake" on the license plate.

1:22:41.667 --> 1:22:46.036
<i>Well, Snake will have to slither his ass
all the way to the bus stop in the morning.</i>

1:22:48.441 --> 1:22:52.901
Police officers.
We need to check the lot for a car.

1:22:52.979 --> 1:22:54.913
Go ahead.

1:23:01.187 --> 1:23:03.655
Check this out, man.
Here's some low-ridin' music.

1:23:03.723 --> 1:23:07.420
It's a little bit different than that cracker
shit you used to be playin'. Check this out.

1:23:11.197 --> 1:23:14.792
You like that. You feelin' it?
Are you feelin' it?

1:23:14.867 --> 1:23:18.428
I know you're feelin' it.

1:23:18.504 --> 1:23:21.667
Oh! Snake!
Get this thing off me!

1:23:21.741 --> 1:23:24.175
Snake! Snake! Snake!

1:23:32.318 --> 1:23:35.344
Get this thing off me, man!
It's a snake!

1:23:35.421 --> 1:23:37.753
It's tryin' to kill me, man!
Get this thing off me!

1:23:39.192 --> 1:23:41.922
<i>Somebody always want to kill</i>
<i>a brother. Man, this is wrong.</i>

1:23:41.994 --> 1:23:44.462
What the hell are you doing?
Get the snake!

1:23:46.299 --> 1:23:49.234
- Use the brakes!
- I am!

1:23:50.703 --> 1:23:54.332
<i>This snake is crawlin' up my ass, man!</i>

1:23:54.407 --> 1:23:57.570
This snake is up my ass!

1:23:57.643 --> 1:23:59.508
This snake gonna swallow
my shit!

1:24:28.207 --> 1:24:32.541
God, I love that car.
All right. Two ladies, home safe.

1:24:32.612 --> 1:24:36.810
<i>He's tucking in Vanessa,</i>
<i>and Bernadine just took me for a ride.</i>

1:24:38.251 --> 1:24:40.185
What's the count?

1:24:40.253 --> 1:24:43.154
- Forty-eight.
- Yes!

1:24:43.222 --> 1:24:45.349
But Mirror and Sphinx
had some unexpected visitors.

1:24:45.424 --> 1:24:47.858
- Castlebeck?
- I think so.

1:24:47.927 --> 1:24:50.020
- Everything cool?
- Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

1:24:50.096 --> 1:24:52.690
They're on their way back to Otto's.
Donny and Freb are already there.

1:24:52.765 --> 1:24:56.531
- What about Kip and Tumbler?
- No word yet.

1:24:56.602 --> 1:24:59.662
<i>Lost in suburbia. Hell, where are we?</i>

1:24:59.739 --> 1:25:02.003
- What do you mean? You don't know where you're going?
- Which way is out?

1:25:02.074 --> 1:25:04.008
I don't know where I am.
Everything looks the same to me.

1:25:04.076 --> 1:25:05.600
You don't know
where you're going?

1:25:05.678 --> 1:25:07.646
- <i>That is a cop.</i>
- No, it's not. That's rent-a-cop.

1:25:09.649 --> 1:25:11.947
- Slow down. Slow down.
- He's pulling a U-turn.

1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:16.449
Oh, man,
we're in big trouble.

1:25:16.522 --> 1:25:18.456
<i>In pursuit of stolen Cadillac S.U.V.,</i>

1:25:18.524 --> 1:25:22.085
<i>traveling west</i>
<i>on Murray Drive.</i>

1:25:22.161 --> 1:25:25.221
- Roadblock, Kip. Oh, shit. - Look
out for the roadblock! - Go, go!

1:25:31.938 --> 1:25:34.930
Go!

1:25:37.276 --> 1:25:40.245
- Oh, man.
- Motherfucker.

1:25:40.313 --> 1:25:42.543
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- I need help, man.

1:25:42.615 --> 1:25:47.814
- <i>What?</i>
- He's been shot! Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1:25:47.887 --> 1:25:49.752
- Don't touch me!
- We need to go to the hospital, man!

1:25:49.822 --> 1:25:51.756
People ask questions
in hospitals, Kip.

1:25:51.824 --> 1:25:55.487
- <i>Go to the hospital!</i>
- You should use your head. We're in a stolen car!

1:25:57.063 --> 1:25:59.327
Now, this does not look good.

1:25:59.398 --> 1:26:02.526
You're gonna be all right.

1:26:04.837 --> 1:26:06.634
- Oh, man!
- What happened?

1:26:06.706 --> 1:26:10.437
- We ran into security patrol.
- He hid in the van. We didn't know he was there.

1:26:10.509 --> 1:26:12.909
We gotta get you to a doctor, private.
I know just where to go.

1:26:12.979 --> 1:26:16.471
- Let's get him to a car.
- No! Ow!

1:26:17.683 --> 1:26:21.210
Lie in the back.
Lie down in the back.

1:26:21.287 --> 1:26:24.051
Tumbler, you and Kip take
the last van back to Otto's.

1:26:24.123 --> 1:26:26.387
- <i>You all right?</i>
- <i>Yeah, go.</i>

1:26:28.294 --> 1:26:31.889
- What are you doin'?
- I'm goin' with him.

1:26:36.736 --> 1:26:38.897
- If something should go wrong, just...
- <i>Let's go!</i>

1:26:38.971 --> 1:26:41.804
I'll take care of him, man.

1:26:44.977 --> 1:26:47.377
Let's finish this.

1:27:02.828 --> 1:27:04.887
- What's up?
- What's the story with that Humvee?

1:27:04.964 --> 1:27:07.091
- Gone.
- Cadillac?

1:27:07.166 --> 1:27:09.157
The same.
Where are we goin'?

1:27:09.235 --> 1:27:11.669
The only '67 Shelby
in the area is registered...

1:27:11.737 --> 1:27:14.205
at a place called
the International Towers in Long Beach.

1:27:14.273 --> 1:27:17.003
Let's go to Long Beach.

1:27:49.909 --> 1:27:52.309
I know we got a history, Eleanor,

1:27:52.378 --> 1:27:57.042
and that that history has not
been great, but I promise...

1:27:58.217 --> 1:28:00.378
you take care of me,
I'll take care of you.

1:28:22.241 --> 1:28:24.004
Shit.

1:28:28.748 --> 1:28:31.216
The easy way or the hard way,
Raines. Easy way or the hard way?

1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:45.490
- Hey!
- I think he's choosin' the hard way.

1:28:45.564 --> 1:28:48.658
All right.

1:29:01.046 --> 1:29:05.142
One-Baker-eleven.
I n pursuit of '67 Ford Mustang, gray.

1:29:11.223 --> 1:29:14.317
- That sign said "Do Not Enter."
- Yeah. You noticed, huh?

1:29:14.393 --> 1:29:16.657
- Jesus!
- Keep your pants on.

1:29:20.032 --> 1:29:23.058
Suspect now traveling east
on Fourth Street.

1:29:29.408 --> 1:29:32.104
<i>Correction.</i>
<i>Make that north on Main.</i>

1:29:46.725 --> 1:29:49.387
Move! Get the fuck...
Just move!

1:30:01.474 --> 1:30:03.874
Get out of there!

1:30:07.346 --> 1:30:10.782
Oh, you wanna get
crazy with me!

1:30:10.850 --> 1:30:13.341
Come on, boy.

1:31:22.888 --> 1:31:27.951
<i>One-Baker-eleven. Unit three involved</i>
<i>in a T.A. At St. Vincent's and Seventh.</i>

1:32:02.628 --> 1:32:06.086
<i>All units, pursuit has entered flood</i>
<i>control adjacent to 710 freeway.</i>

1:32:06.165 --> 1:32:09.157
- Where's that air unit?
- Requesting air unit. Same location.

1:32:11.537 --> 1:32:14.131
<i>Air One. We're over the pursuit.</i>

1:32:14.206 --> 1:32:17.471
<i>Suspect traveling southbound</i>
<i>at 90 miles an hour.</i>

1:32:21.180 --> 1:32:23.478
- <i>Stay with him, Air One.</i>
- <i>I'm all over him.</i>

1:32:31.657 --> 1:32:35.525
- <i>Suspect has increased speed to 120.</i>
- <i>Maintain visual, Air One.</i>

1:32:35.594 --> 1:32:38.427
<i>140 miles an hour.</i>

1:32:38.497 --> 1:32:41.489
- <i>Do not lose him.</i>
- <i>This is an A-Star, sir, not an Apache.</i>

1:32:41.567 --> 1:32:43.831
<i>One-fifty. One-sixty.</i>

1:32:45.037 --> 1:32:47.198
- He's gone.
- God!

1:32:47.272 --> 1:32:49.706
- Man, this guy can drive.
- What, what?

1:32:49.775 --> 1:32:52.505
It's probably mostly the car.

1:32:54.813 --> 1:32:56.747
Hey, what time is it?

1:32:59.118 --> 1:33:01.245
7:30.

1:33:04.023 --> 1:33:07.618
I think I'm gonna have to get
you out of town or something.

1:33:07.693 --> 1:33:12.630
Your brother's the best boost in the world,
but I don't know if he's gonna make this one.

1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:19.130
I'm not like my brother, you know.
I just don't abandon my friends.

1:33:19.204 --> 1:33:21.968
Oh, man. I ought to
smack you silly, boy.

1:33:25.277 --> 1:33:27.768
You know, your brother ran away,
is that what you think?

1:33:27.846 --> 1:33:30.212
You better get your story
straight.

1:33:32.317 --> 1:33:35.650
Well, go on then.
Straighten it out.

1:33:35.721 --> 1:33:38.053
Your mother told him to go.

1:33:38.123 --> 1:33:42.787
<i>She knew if Memphis stayed,</i>
<i>you were gonna walk his line.</i>

1:33:42.861 --> 1:33:44.795
<i>You were gonna join</i>
<i>his crew.</i>

1:33:44.863 --> 1:33:47.058
<i>But she told him</i>
<i>to pick up and go.</i>

1:33:47.132 --> 1:33:51.159
And he did, thinkin'
it was best for you.

1:33:51.236 --> 1:33:55.229
<i>He left all of us.</i>
<i>For you.</i>

1:33:57.076 --> 1:33:59.067
Guess it wasn't that big a deal
for him though, really.

1:33:59.144 --> 1:34:03.808
Wasn't that big a sacrifice, leavin'
everything he'd ever known behind.

1:34:03.882 --> 1:34:06.112
And six years later,
ain't life grand?

1:34:06.185 --> 1:34:10.815
You became a car boost anyway.
How about that?

1:34:11.890 --> 1:34:14.757
I sedated him.
He's sleeping.

1:34:14.827 --> 1:34:16.761
<i>He's gonna be just fine.</i>

1:34:44.189 --> 1:34:47.716
It's just a scratch, Eleanor.
It can be fixed.

1:34:47.793 --> 1:34:50.455
No, no, no, don't.

1:34:50.529 --> 1:34:52.622
Don't do this to me.
Don't... Don't start with me.

1:34:52.698 --> 1:34:54.632
Don't... No, no... No, start!

1:34:54.700 --> 1:34:57.965
Start, start, start.
Come on. Come on.

1:35:00.305 --> 1:35:04.036
<i>I need you, Eleanor.</i>
<i>I need you now, now.</i>

1:35:10.883 --> 1:35:12.817
<i>All units, be advised.</i>

1:35:12.885 --> 1:35:15.513
<i>Suspect vehicle headed south</i>
<i>on Henry Ford Boulevard.</i>

1:35:15.587 --> 1:35:18.021
We should hit him at Ocean Avenue
at the end of this bridge.

1:35:19.992 --> 1:35:21.926
There he is.
There he is! Yeah.

1:35:21.994 --> 1:35:25.122
I got you, Raines!
I got you, boy!

1:35:30.435 --> 1:35:33.199
That's it. Keep it comin'.

1:35:47.219 --> 1:35:50.347
Whoa! Shit!
Shit.

<i>Suspect heading in your direction.</i>

<i>One-Baker-eleven, he's at the end</i>
<i>of the pier turning towards you.</i>

<i>Wait! Hang on! Hang onto it!</i>

1:37:14.539 --> 1:37:16.302
Oh, shit.

1:37:29.888 --> 1:37:32.379
Move, move!

1:37:47.906 --> 1:37:50.875
Is he okay?

1:37:50.943 --> 1:37:52.877
- How are you doing? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1:37:52.945 --> 1:37:55.004
- Are you okay? Just sit back. You all right?
- I think so.

1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:59.176
Are you sure?
'Cause you just went through a wall.

1:38:05.757 --> 1:38:08.089
<i>Negative, Air One.</i>
<i>Incoming aircraft on approach.</i>

1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:10.924
<i>Hold your position.</i>

1:38:10.996 --> 1:38:14.932
<i>I repeat, do not enter</i>
<i>airport air space.</i>

1:38:19.871 --> 1:38:21.600
<i>Hey!</i>

1:38:40.092 --> 1:38:42.617
<i>That one's got a broken leg!</i>

1:39:05.650 --> 1:39:07.481
There he is.
There he is.

1:39:12.057 --> 1:39:15.117
Get outta the car, man!

1:39:18.497 --> 1:39:20.829
Raines!

1:40:08.146 --> 1:40:10.979
- Where's, uh... Where's Memphis?
- I don't know, man.

1:40:11.049 --> 1:40:14.485
- He's not back yet.
- What do you mean, he's not back yet?

1:40:14.553 --> 1:40:17.215
It's 8:00.

1:40:21.293 --> 1:40:23.818
- Atley.
- Time's up, Atley.

1:40:23.895 --> 1:40:27.092
I've got 49 cars.
That's one less than required.

1:40:27.165 --> 1:40:29.156
- Bring the kid, and we'll settle this.
- What kid is that?

1:40:29.234 --> 1:40:33.330
Oh, you know. The Cincinnati Kid, Billy
the Kid. Which kid did you think I mean?

1:40:33.405 --> 1:40:36.067
Oh, gee, I don't know.
I think that maybe you mean Kip Raines.

1:40:36.141 --> 1:40:38.075
<i>Well, gee.</i>
<i>I think you're right.</i>

1:40:38.143 --> 1:40:43.240
Yeah. Well, you know, it's a funny thing.
That little son of a bitch evaded me.

1:40:43.315 --> 1:40:46.341
- Find him, Atley.
- Well, what if I can't find him?

1:40:46.418 --> 1:40:49.546
Then big brother takes the fall for the
slipup. It doesn't matter much to me.

1:40:49.621 --> 1:40:54.684
One Raines is as good as another.
It never rains, but it pours.

1:40:54.759 --> 1:40:58.889
Son of a...! Just... Well, you know,
I think you can thank your big brother.

1:40:58.964 --> 1:41:02.695
I think he just took your place
under the guillotine.

1:41:11.943 --> 1:41:15.276
Sorry, mate.
We're all done here.

1:41:15.347 --> 1:41:18.282
- No, we're not done. This is number 50.
- <i>You're late.</i>

1:41:18.350 --> 1:41:21.183
So sod off.
You got a problem with that,

1:41:21.253 --> 1:41:23.585
take it up with Calitri.

1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:46.839
- You're late.
- Wait. You're gonna argue with me over 12 minutes?

1:41:46.912 --> 1:41:49.972
I just stole 50 cars for you
in one night!

1:41:50.048 --> 1:41:53.108
All right? I'm a little tired.
I'm a little wired!

1:41:53.185 --> 1:41:55.983
And I think I deserve
a little appreciation.

1:41:56.054 --> 1:41:58.648
I said 50 cars, not 491/2.

1:41:58.723 --> 1:42:04.093
491/2? She's not so bad, man. She's got,
what? You know, some paint and, uh...

1:42:06.031 --> 1:42:08.932
<i>Some fiberglass.</i>
<i>Yes, indeedy.</i>

1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:12.231
You know, and the book
on her is 60, 70, call it 80.

1:42:12.304 --> 1:42:17.571
So you take 80, all right? You subtract
it from 200. All right. And we make a deal.

1:42:17.642 --> 1:42:20.611
You take 80 from 200,
and we call it even.

1:42:20.679 --> 1:42:23.079
Done.

1:42:23.148 --> 1:42:26.117
All right. Good. And this thing
with my brother's over.

1:42:26.184 --> 1:42:28.345
It's over.

1:42:28.420 --> 1:42:30.445
It's done.
It's finished.

1:42:31.957 --> 1:42:33.891
Done. Finished.

1:42:40.932 --> 1:42:44.891
Nobody insults me.
Nobody puts a gun to me head.

1:42:46.771 --> 1:42:49.899
Kill him.
Shred the car.

1:42:59.384 --> 1:43:04.014
All right. Where's
Raymond Calitri's place?

1:43:04.089 --> 1:43:06.785
Exeter Salvage and Steel.
It's on the water. Why, are we goin'?

1:43:06.858 --> 1:43:09.383
Because, you know, homicide specifically
ordered us not to interfere.

1:43:09.461 --> 1:43:11.588
To hell with homicide.

1:43:27.746 --> 1:43:29.714
Unicorn.

1:43:29.781 --> 1:43:31.840
- What?
- Nothing.

1:43:36.821 --> 1:43:39.517
So, where would
you like it, sir?

1:43:39.591 --> 1:43:42.116
I n the head
or in the chest?

1:43:42.193 --> 1:43:45.094
- The chest.
- My pleasure.

1:43:45.163 --> 1:43:47.290
<i>Hey, wait a minute, fellas! Hold it.</i>

1:43:47.365 --> 1:43:50.664
- Big change of plan here.
- That's far enough, Atley.

1:43:50.735 --> 1:43:53.101
What are you doing?
No, no, no!

1:43:53.171 --> 1:43:54.968
I said stop there, Atley!

1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:58.100
<i>No, no. Calitri just sent me</i>
<i>up here to ask you a question.</i>

1:44:08.253 --> 1:44:10.653
<i>All right? Everything's</i>
<i>gonna be all right. We got it covered.</i>

1:44:10.722 --> 1:44:12.952
Get my brother outta here.

1:44:14.559 --> 1:44:18.518
Hey.

1:44:18.596 --> 1:44:21.793
You made a mistake
pickin' a kid to do your dirty work.

1:44:21.866 --> 1:44:25.131
<i>Made an even bigger mistake</i>
<i>pickin' my kid brother.</i>

1:44:25.203 --> 1:44:28.969
And now, you just made
the biggest mistake tryin' to kill me.

1:44:33.712 --> 1:44:35.577
- No. Be careful with that.
- This?

1:44:35.647 --> 1:44:38.741
- Just put it down.
- That's right. You got a thing about wood.

1:44:38.817 --> 1:44:41.251
Just put it down.

1:44:41.319 --> 1:44:43.879
No! No!

1:44:43.955 --> 1:44:45.650
- No!
- I... I...

1:44:45.724 --> 1:44:47.589
- No!
- Oh, no.

1:45:29.401 --> 1:45:32.529
- Psst.
- I'm good.

1:46:39.537 --> 1:46:41.437
God! Jesus!

1:46:42.674 --> 1:46:44.835
God.

1:46:46.544 --> 1:46:50.310
- Who are you?
- I'm a police officer. You don't wanna do that now.

1:46:50.381 --> 1:46:52.542
- Yeah, I do.
- Listen to me.

1:46:52.617 --> 1:46:56.883
You walk outta here with me, you got some
options. You kill me... now you think about this...

1:46:56.955 --> 1:47:00.254
I'm a police officer.
Your life will be over.

1:47:00.325 --> 1:47:03.692
No, you've got that the wrong way
around. If I kill you, your life's over.

1:47:03.761 --> 1:47:08.289
<i>Not all bad, though. Funeral will be on the
telly. Everybody out there, pressed and dressed.</i>

1:47:08.366 --> 1:47:13.201
Guard of honor. Twenty-one gun salute and the
Stars and Stripes draped all over your coffin.

1:47:14.305 --> 1:47:16.500
It'll be the greatest day
of your life.

1:47:47.038 --> 1:47:50.201
Here I am smack dab in the middle
of a moral dilemma, Randall.

1:47:50.275 --> 1:47:54.871
You've torn this town to shreds with that
little escapade of yours. You and your Eleanor.

1:47:54.946 --> 1:47:58.780
But I understand
what brought you back here.

1:47:58.850 --> 1:48:03.048
A brother's love
is a brother's love.

1:48:05.089 --> 1:48:07.853
You saved my life,
didn't you?

1:48:07.926 --> 1:48:10.759
<i>So what am I gonna do?</i>

1:48:10.828 --> 1:48:13.490
It's your call,
Detective.

1:48:15.333 --> 1:48:18.894
Get outta here, Randall.
I'll clean this up.

1:48:20.772 --> 1:48:24.765
Go, Randall, before
I change my mind. Go.

1:48:27.312 --> 1:48:32.545
Oh, uh, there's
a container ship. At pier 14.

1:48:32.617 --> 1:48:34.710
You might want to
check it out.

1:48:43.861 --> 1:48:49.231
Oh. Look here. Can a good-lookin',
hard-workin' chef get a beer around here?

1:48:49.300 --> 1:48:52.269
Come on, Tumbler. You ain't
doin' nothin'. Hand me a beer, baby.

1:48:53.738 --> 1:48:57.538
All right, Memphis,
guys, food! Thank you, sir.

1:48:57.609 --> 1:48:59.736
Damn.

1:48:59.811 --> 1:49:01.836
- Ow, ow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:49:01.913 --> 1:49:06.782
Poor Toby, man. Sure looks
like he's in a lot of pain.

1:49:06.851 --> 1:49:09.046
If that's pain,
you can shoot me anytime.

1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:11.953
Sexy, sexy.

1:49:13.191 --> 1:49:15.159
If his unpleasant wounding...

1:49:15.226 --> 1:49:17.421
has in some way enlightened
the rest of you...

1:49:17.495 --> 1:49:21.022
<i>as to the grim finish below</i>
<i>the glossy veneer of criminal life...</i>

1:49:21.099 --> 1:49:23.465
<i>and inspired you to change</i>
<i>your ways,</i>

1:49:23.534 --> 1:49:29.063
then his injuries carry with it an
inherent nobility and a supreme glory.

1:49:29.140 --> 1:49:31.301
We should all be
so fortunate.

1:49:31.376 --> 1:49:34.675
You say, "Poor Toby."

1:49:34.746 --> 1:49:38.614
I say, "Poor us."

1:49:38.683 --> 1:49:40.708
- He spoke.
- Yeah.

1:49:40.785 --> 1:49:42.719
Hey, man, I thought you were
from Long Beach.

1:49:45.323 --> 1:49:47.883
<i>Hey, Memphis. Hey.</i>

1:49:50.294 --> 1:49:52.421
I have something for you.

1:49:52.497 --> 1:49:54.897
- What is this?
- Open it.

1:49:56.567 --> 1:50:00.230
Keys. Keys are good.
What do I do with 'em?

1:50:00.304 --> 1:50:02.568
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>
<i>Everybody.</i>

1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:06.303
Inside here. Let's go.
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

1:50:06.377 --> 1:50:10.108
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my great pleasure...

1:50:11.516 --> 1:50:13.541
to present...

1:50:13.618 --> 1:50:15.518
- Oh, man. Oh, man!
- There you go. Eleanor.

1:50:15.586 --> 1:50:18.783
- <i>What? What? It's Eleanor.</i>
- <i>How about that?</i>

1:50:18.856 --> 1:50:21.450
- Look at his face.
- <i>All yours.</i>

1:50:23.127 --> 1:50:25.891
Now it's a heap, but give me
a couple of weeks and it'll look like...

1:50:25.963 --> 1:50:27.794
a streamlined butterfly.

1:50:32.070 --> 1:50:34.595
- You didn't...
- Oh, no, no, no.

1:50:34.672 --> 1:50:37.436
I, uh... I parted the chopper
out for that.

1:50:37.508 --> 1:50:40.671
I'm blown away.

1:50:40.745 --> 1:50:42.872
You bought me a car.

1:50:42.947 --> 1:50:46.542
Well, yeah, you know. It's just
a token of my appreciation for, uh...

1:50:46.617 --> 1:50:49.211
<i>For everything.</i>

1:50:51.089 --> 1:50:54.183
<i>That's the way it should be.</i>

1:50:54.258 --> 1:50:56.692
That's the way it should be.
That's right.

1:50:59.430 --> 1:51:03.025
- Yeah.
- Why don't you get in there and go for a ride?

1:51:03.101 --> 1:51:05.763
I know what you did.

1:51:05.837 --> 1:51:09.398
- And I thank you.
- I'll see you later, man.

1:51:21.352 --> 1:51:24.048
- You wanna go for a ride?
- Hell, yes.

1:51:46.110 --> 1:51:48.442
<i>Oh, don't do this to me.</i>
