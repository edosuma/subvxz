WEBVTT

00:11.044 --> 00:15.448
[ APPLAUSE ]
>>> I'M LAURA INGRAHAM, AND AS

00:15.448 --> 00:20.153
SOON AS I MARRY YOUR DAD, I'M
SENDING YOU STRAIGHT TO BOARDING
SCHOOL.

00:20.153 --> 00:25.392
WELL, WE'RE FINALLY DONE WITH
YEAR ONE OF BIDEN'S PRESIDENCY.
CAN WE ALL ADMIT IT'S A

00:25.392 --> 00:32.665
DISASTER?
INFLATION'S OUT OF CONTROL.
GAS IS AT $19 A GALLON.

00:32.665 --> 00:42.575
AND THE GREEN M&M HAS BEEN
CANCELED JUST FOR BEING A WHORE.
THINGS ARE SO BAD IN BIDEN'S

00:42.575 --> 00:52.485
AMERICA, EVEN FORMER WENDY'S
SPOKES GIRL JEN PSAKI
FACADE IS BEGINNING TO CRACK.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.420
SPOKES GIRL JEN PSAKI
FACADE IS BEGINNING TO CRACK.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

00:56.122 --> 00:58.391
VOTING RIGHTS IS APPARENTLY NOT
GOING TO PASS.
AND VACCINE REQUIREMENTS ARE

00:58.391 --> 01:00.827
APPARENTLY ILLEGAL.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WE ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE.

01:00.827 --> 01:05.065
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SHOULD VOTE
US OUT.
>> THE BEST TWO THINGS SHE'S

01:05.065 --> 01:10.203
EVER SAID.
PLUS THE NATION IS STILL
MOURNING FROM THE SUDDEN LOSS OF

01:10.203 --> 01:16.976
AMERICA'S DAD, ROBERT DURST.
THE COUNTRY'S ON ITS LAST LEGS,
FOLKS.

01:16.976 --> 01:21.681
LIBERALS WANT TO TAKE AWAY
EVERYTHING THAT MAKES YOU
AMERICAN.

01:21.681 --> 01:27.087
FOR EXAMPLE, GUNS, HAMBURGERS,
MORGAN WALLEN.
I DON'T CARE IF HE USES A SLUR,

01:27.087 --> 01:34.728
I JUST WANT TO DANCE.
YOUR BACKUP GUNS, COMMERCIAL
WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY IS THE

01:34.728 --> 01:40.967
SAME THING.
USING THE WORD MAYONNAISE.
IT'S AIOLI ALL OF A SUDDEN, NO

01:40.967 --> 01:47.741
THANKS, LIN-MANUEL.
AND FINALLY, MISSIONARY.
MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE

01:47.741 --> 01:55.115
TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE'S PUSHING
BACK AGAINST BIDEN'S TYRANNY.
YOU KNOW HIM.

01:55.115 --> 01:59.185
YOU KNOW HIM.
TED CRUZ.
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:59.185 --> 02:01.788
>> HELLO, HELLO.
HELLO, LAURA.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.924
>> BEARD STILL GOING STRONG,
HUH, TED?
>> OH, YEAH.

02:04.924 --> 02:14.401
MY BEARD IS LIKE JANUARY 6th.
SHOCKING AT FIRST, BUT SADLY
IT'S BEEN NORMALIZED.

02:14.401 --> 02:20.774
>> RIGHT.
SPEAKING OF JANUARY 6th, YOU
RECENTLY HAD TO APOLOGIZE

02:20.774 --> 02:26.312
FOR CALLING THE CAPITOL RIOTERS
TERRORISTS.
>> I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.

02:26.312 --> 02:33.186
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE CALLED THEM
TERRORISTS.
THE TRUTH IS, THEY ARE BIG,

02:33.186 --> 02:34.821
BURLY
MEN WITH BIG "D" ENERGY.
IN FACT, I ACTUALLY LIKE THEM A

02:34.821 --> 02:36.456
LOT.
THEY ARE MY COOL FRIENDS.
AND DONALD, IF YOU'RE WATCHING,

02:36.456 --> 02:38.425
I LOVE YOU, BABY.
YOU ARE THE KING.
HONESTLY, HIT ME.

02:38.425 --> 02:44.130
>> DID YOU JUST ASK TRUMP TO HIT
YOU?
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:44.130 --> 02:50.337
HIT ME, CHOKE ME, SPIT IN MY
FACE.
I JUST WANT TO STAY IN THE MIX.

02:50.337 --> 02:57.243
>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE, TED.
>> OH, AND ONE MORE THING.
I LIKE TO REMIND ALL MY FELLOW

02:57.243 --> 02:59.646
TEXANS WATCHING AT HOME THAT
FEBRUARY'S GOING TO BE A COLD
ONE, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO BOOK

02:59.646 --> 03:05.051
YOUR VACAY TO CANCUN NOW.
LIVE MAS, EVERYBODY!
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

03:05.051 --> 03:11.224
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO
THANK MY FEW REMAINING LOYAL
SPONSORS.

03:11.224 --> 03:16.463
COVID NEGS, THE COVID TEST
THAT'S GUARANTEED TO BE NEGATIVE
EVEN IF YOU HAVE IT.

03:16.463 --> 03:21.167
COVID NEGS, I'M GOING TO YOUR
WEDDING.
AND FALSE ALARM MEDICAL ALERT.

03:21.167 --> 03:27.407
IF YOUR GRANDKIDS THINK IT'S THE
END, THEY'LL CALL.
AND WHITE PIZZA.

03:27.407 --> 03:36.783
FOR WHEN ITALIAN IS TOO ETHNIC.
OUR NEXT GUEST IS THE LATEST
VICTIM OF THE VACCINE POLICE

03:36.783 --> 03:38.785
WITH A NAME I SOMEHOW HAVE AN
EASIER TIME LEARNING TO
PRONOUNCE THAN KAMALA HARRIS.

03:38.785 --> 03:49.462
PLEASE WELCOME NOVAK DJOKOVIC.
>> YES.
OH, YES.

03:49.462 --> 03:50.797
GOOD DEAL.
CALL ME BY MY NICKNAME, THE
JOKER.

03:50.797 --> 03:54.701
ALTHOUGH RIGHT NOW I'M THE LEAST
POPULAR JOKER, EXCEPT FOR
JARED LETO.

03:54.701 --> 04:00.940
>> NOW I FOUND HIM RELATABLE.
SO NOVAK, YOU WERE DEPORTED FROM
AUSTRALIA FOR REFUSING TO BE

04:00.940 --> 04:09.582
VACCINATED, AND I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD HEAR MYSELF USE THE WORD
"DEPORTED" IN A BAD WAY.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.251
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> I WENT TO AUSTRALIA, AND MY
VISA WAS DENIED.

04:11.251 --> 04:23.797
BUT THEN I APPEALED TO THE
JUDGE, AND THIS WAS HIS RULING.
>> OUT.

04:23.797 --> 04:28.735
>> I MUST SAY, I AM A FAN OF
YOUR
SPORT, BECAUSE IN TENNIS, LOVE

04:28.735 --> 04:30.837
IS BAD.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU TELL YOUR
SIDE OF THE STORY WHILE I STARE

04:30.837 --> 04:35.308
INTO THE CAMERA LIKE IT'S A RAW
PIECE OF STEAK.
>> OH, THANK YOU, LAURA.

04:35.308 --> 04:43.650
YOU SEE,
PEOPLE LOVE TO TEAR YOU OFF YOUR
PEDESTAL JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

04:43.650 --> 04:45.885
YOU'RE REALLY RICH OR YOU'RE THE
BEST AT TENNIS, OR YOU KNOW, YOU
GO TO A CHARITY EVENT WITH

04:45.885 --> 04:50.423
200 KIDS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
DRIPPING WITH COVID.
BUT IN MY HEART I KNOW THAT ONE

04:50.423 --> 04:52.792
DAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK ON
THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY AND
THINK, "YEAH, WHO CARES?"

04:52.792 --> 04:54.327
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THANK YOU, NOVAK.
SEE YOU AT WIMBLEDON.

04:54.327 --> 04:59.833
>> PROBABLY NOT.
>> YEAH.
MY NEXT GUEST IS HERE TO ADDRESS

04:59.833 --> 05:04.504
A VOTING RIGHTS BILL WHICH WOULD
MAKE IT EASIER FOR MINORITIES TO
VOTE AND HARDER FOR WHITE PEOPLE

05:04.504 --> 05:10.777
IN FLORIDA TO VOTE TWICE.
PLEASE WELCOME MY ONE BLACK
FRIEND, CANDACE OWENS.

05:10.777 --> 05:17.550
>> MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD HAVE
VOTED FOR TRUMP.
>> HELLO TO YOU TOO.

05:17.550 --> 05:30.964
>> LAURA, LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO
MAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT RACE.
TO QUOTE THE ONLY WORDS THAT

05:30.964 --> 05:32.932
MARTIN LUTHER KING EVER SAID, I
HAVE A DREAM.
THAT'S IT, END OF QUOTE.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.669
NOTHING ABOUT MONEY OR JOBS OR
SCHOOLS.
UNLESS YOU COUNT HIS TOMBSTONE

05:35.669 --> 05:38.104
WHICH SAYS, GREAT JOB, GANG,
RACISM OVER.
>> I HOPE PEOPLE AT HOME ARE

05:38.104 --> 05:41.708
WRITING THIS DOWN.
>> THANKS, LAURA.
IT'S MY GREATEST HONOR TO

05:41.708 --> 05:49.082
CONTINUE THE FIGHT FOR AFRICAN
AMERICANS, NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES THEY ASK ME TO STOP.

05:49.082 --> 05:57.924
>> THANK YOU, CANDACE.
NOW I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS
MEANS, BUT WILL YOU BE MY BAE?

05:57.924 --> 06:00.026
I'D LIKE TO THANK A FEW MORE OF
MY LOYAL SPONSORS.
BIBLE BELT.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.595
HOLD YOUR PANTS UP THE WAY GOD
INTENDED.
FLOWER POISON.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.664
EVER SEE A BIG GARDEN FULL OF
FLOWERS AND THINK, "I WISH THEY
WERE DEAD?"

06:04.664 --> 06:10.937
FLOWER POISON.
AND PAULA DEEN'S CHICKPEA MASH.
IT'S NOT RADICAL ISLAMIST

06:10.937 --> 06:21.047
HUMMUS, IT'S AMERICAN CHICKPEA
MASH.
TALK OF THE 2024 REPUBLICAN

06:21.047 --> 06:23.183
PRIMARIES IS ALREADY HEATING UP,
SO LET'S TALK TO THE SVELTE,
MUSCULAR, 230 POUND GORILLA IN

06:23.183 --> 06:31.524
THE ROOM, DONALD TRUMP.
>> HELLO, LAURA.
HELLO, LAURA.

06:31.524 --> 06:36.763
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.
I'M BACK LIKE "TIGER KING 2."
YOU HAD FUN THE FIRST TIME, AND

06:36.763 --> 06:38.865
NOW YOU'RE LIKE, "HOW ARE MORE
PEOPLE FROM THIS NOT IN JAIL
YET?"

06:38.865 --> 06:41.968
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE OUT ON
THE TRAIL AGAIN, CREATING
CONTROVERSY WITH YOUR TYPICAL

06:41.968 --> 06:46.172
WACKO STUFF AND YOUR
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY REASONABLE
TAKES ON BOOSTER SHOTS.

06:46.172 --> 06:51.911
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE OUR
VIEWERS A TASTE?
>> I SURE WOULD.

06:51.911 --> 07:01.021
CAN WE GET TODAY'S WORDLE
PLEASE?
>> I GOT THE BOOSTER, OKAY.

07:01.021 --> 07:05.725
BECAUSE I MADE THE VACCINE.
IT'S A WONDERFUL VACCINE.
BUT IT'S VERY UNFAIR WHAT IS

07:05.725 --> 07:08.061
HAPPENING WITH THE COVID
TREATMENT, OKAY.
WHITE PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD TO

07:08.061 --> 07:13.833
GET IN THE BACK OF LINE.
IT'S REALLY AWFUL.
SPEAKING OF WHITE PEOPLE,

07:13.833 --> 07:16.736
JOHN MAYER.
OKAY, JOHN MAYER HASN'T HAD A
HIT IN SO LONG, BUT WE LOVE

07:16.736 --> 07:19.039
MAYER, OKAY?
BODY WONDERLAND.
COME ON, I THOUGHT IT WAS

07:19.039 --> 07:24.310
TREMENDOUS MUSIC.
I THOUGHT IT WAS TREMENDOUS
MUSIC.

07:24.310 --> 07:31.851
WITH "BODY WONDERLAND."
YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER BE THE
MAYOR OF ANYTHING THAN BE

07:31.851 --> 07:44.531
GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS
I BEAT HIM SO BAD.
JUST LIKE I BEAT HILLARY.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.766
BECAUSE THE ONLY HILLARY WE LIKE
IS DUFF, OKAY?
FROM "HOW I MET YOUR FATHER."

07:46.766 --> 07:49.235
YOU KNOW WHAT, "HOW I MET YOUR
FATHER," IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE
THE CHARM AND SPARKLE OF,

07:49.235 --> 07:51.304
FRANKLY, MOTHER.
OKAY?
BUT WE LOVE DUFF.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.873
YOU KNOW, SHE GOT HER TEETH
FIXED.
SHE GOT HER TEETH FIXED.

07:53.873 --> 07:59.079
AND "LIZZIE McGUIRE," YOU KNOW,
THEY WANTED TO DO A LIZZIE WITH
HULU, BUT THEY SAID NO SEX,

07:59.079 --> 08:09.756
THEY DIDN'T WANT SEX.
SO THEY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS
JUST LIKE LISA AND JASON MAMOA.

08:09.756 --> 08:16.029
AND "THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA."
"DAUGHTERS" IS BY JOHN MYER.
AND I'VE GOT TO RUN TO THE HOLES

08:16.029 --> 08:18.398
OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL IN 2024 WHEN
YOU RE-ELECT TRUMP.
WORDLE!

08:18.398 --> 08:22.702
>> THERE IT IS, WE GOT IT.
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

08:22.702 --> 08:28.241
SATURDAY NIGHT!
[ APPLAUSE ]
[ APPLAUSE ]

10:29.396 --> 10:35.769
MUSICAL GUEST MANESKIN.
AND YOUR HOST, WILL FORTE.

10:45.045 --> 11:01.394
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WILL
FORTE!
[ APPLAUSE ]

11:05.732 --> 11:07.434
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HOSTING

11:07.434 --> 11:14.374
"SNL."
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> I --

11:14.374 --> 11:19.379
I WAS IN THE CAST 12 YEARS AGO
WITH KRISTEN WIIG, BILL HADER,
ANDY SAMBERG, JASON SUDEIKIS AND

11:19.379 --> 11:32.125
FRED ARMISEN.
SO IT WAS REALLY FUN TO SEE
KRISTEN HOST.

11:32.125 --> 11:36.096
YEP.
AND BILL.
AND THEN ANDY.

11:36.096 --> 11:40.266
THEN FRED.
THEN KRISTEN AGAIN.
THEN BILL AGAIN.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.503
THEN JASON.
SETH MEYERS.
I MEAN, HE'S ONE OF MY BEST

11:43.503 --> 11:48.108
BUDS, RIGHT?
BUT, COME ON.
HE WASN'T REALLY A SKETCH GUY,

11:48.108 --> 11:53.279
HE WAS JUST ON "WEEKEND UPDATE."
DOES THAT EVEN COUNT AS BEING ON
THE SHOW?

11:53.279 --> 11:57.117
BUT HE HOSTED.
RIGHT?
JOHN MULANEY WAS A WRITER WHEN I

11:57.117 --> 12:03.156
WAS IN THE CAST.
AND THEN HE HOSTED FOUR TIMES.
FOUR TIMES.

12:03.156 --> 12:09.963
BUT HEY, THAT'S OKAY.
I'M NOT BITTER ABOUT IT.
I'M NOT.

12:09.963 --> 12:19.906
OH.
SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST, RIGHT?
[ APPLAUSE ]

12:19.906 --> 12:32.852
>> SAVED THE BEST FOR WAY LAST.
BUT, LOOK, AFTER 12 LONG YEARS,
TONIGHT IT'S FINALLY MY TURN.

12:32.852 --> 12:46.499
MY TIME TO SHINE.
TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT ME.
[ APPLAUSE ]

12:46.499 --> 12:55.675
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
KRISTEN.
HEY.

12:55.675 --> 13:00.046
YEAH.
>> WILL, I AM SO EXCITED THAT
YOU'RE HOSTING.

13:00.046 --> 13:04.384
>> NOT A GOOD TIME.
NOT A GOOD TIME.
>> OKAY.

13:04.384 --> 13:09.255
>> YEAH.
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
BYE-BYE!

13:09.255 --> 13:12.592
>> OH.
SO -- SO I SHOULD GO?
>> YEAH, I THINK SO.

13:12.592 --> 13:19.899
>> I FLEW IN FOR THIS.
>> OH, GREAT, SO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE AIRPORT IS.

13:19.899 --> 13:40.220
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, BACK TO NORTH KOREA.
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO GET OUT.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.756
>> SO I DON'T LOVE
THAT SHE GOT MORE APPLAUSE THAN
WHEN I CAME OUT.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.091
YOU KNOW, I CAME OUT ONCE WHEN
SHE WAS HOSTING, AND I DID
SOMETHING IN HER MONOLOGUE.

13:45.091 --> 13:49.763
BUT I WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO GET
LESS APPLAUSE THAN HER.
YOU KNOW.

13:49.763 --> 13:54.901
BUT LOOK, MY POINT IS, MAYBE THE
UNIVERSE HAD A REASON FOR MAKING
ME WAIT TO HOST.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.703
YOU KNOW?
MAYBE IT WANTED ME TO WAIT UNTIL
"MacGRUBER," THE SERIES, WAS

13:56.703 --> 14:03.910
STREAMING ON PEACOCK.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> YEAH.

14:03.910 --> 14:08.081
NOW, SPEAKING OF "MacGRUBER," I
WOULD LIKE TO OFFICIALLY
ANNOUNCE THAT "MacGRUBER" HAS

14:08.081 --> 14:19.159
BEEN PICKED UP FOR A SEASON TWO.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE

14:19.159 --> 14:21.161
THAT.
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN PICKED UP
YET, SO I CAN'T.

14:21.161 --> 14:26.466
YOU KNOW, WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR.
BUT I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE
IN GREAT HANDS TONIGHT.

14:26.466 --> 14:33.707
YOU KNOW?
STRONG, VEINY COMEDY HANDS.
AND, LOOK, IF I COULD JUST TAKE

14:33.707 --> 14:39.479
A SERIOUS MOMENT.
I'D LIKE TO SAY HOW MUCH THIS
SHOW HAS MEANT TO ME.

14:39.479 --> 14:45.785
I STARTED MY CAREER HERE, AND
THEY ALWAYS SUPPORTED ME.
WAIT A SECOND.

14:45.785 --> 14:53.193
ARE THEY PLAYING ME OFF?
ARE YOU PLAYING ME OFF IN MY OWN
MONOLOGUE?

14:53.193 --> 14:58.164
I WAITED 12 FREAKING YEARS FOR
THIS.
HAVE YOU SEEN SOME OF THE IDIOTS

14:58.164 --> 15:04.671
THEY HAD HOST THE SHOW SINCE
THEN.
KRISTEN, BILL, ANDY, FRED.

15:04.671 --> 15:09.409
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL TAKE ONE QUESTION.
YOU, SIR.

15:09.409 --> 15:29.295
>> I'M SO SORRY, WILL.
THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
>> HEY!

15:29.295 --> 15:35.068
>> WILLEM DAFOE, YOU'RE HOSTING
NEXT WEEK.
>> I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THIS

15:35.068 --> 15:40.774
WEEK.
>> YOU THINK I'D BOOK SOMEONE
NAMED WILL, THEN SOMEONE NAMED

15:40.774 --> 15:44.411
WILLEM?
>> OH MY GOD, THIS IS NOT
HAPPENING.

15:44.411 --> 15:48.581
YOU TEXTED ME TO COME HOST,
LORNE.
>> I TESTED WILLEM, AND YOU

15:48.581 --> 15:58.091
KNOW, AUTO CORRECT.
>> ALL RIGHT, FINE.
THEN LET'S HAVE THE FANS DECIDE

15:58.091 --> 16:08.468
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
>> OH, MY GOD?
5%?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.403
I GUESS PEOPLE DO LOVE ME.
LOOK, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.
I'M HERE, MANESKIN'S HERE.

16:10.403 --> 16:17.077
I'M HERE, MANESKIN'S HERE.
SO STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

16:22.716 --> 16:28.788
* MAKING LIFE
MacGRUBER
YOU NEED AN ANIMAL FOR *

16:28.788 --> 16:32.058
* STICKY SITUATIONS
MacGRUBER
THE GUY'S A FREAKING *

16:32.058 --> 16:39.132
THE GUY'S A FREAKING *
* GENIUS
MacGRUBER *

16:41.334 --> 16:45.305
SEALED.
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!
>> MacGRUBER, IF WE DON'T

16:45.305 --> 16:47.941
DISMANTLE THE C4 EXPLOSIVE, THIS
WHOLE BUILDING IS GOING TO BLOW
SKY HIGH.

16:47.941 --> 16:51.778
60 SECONDS.
>> OKAY, DON'T WORRY, GANG, WE
CAN DO THIS IF WE WORK TOGETHER

16:51.778 --> 16:57.317
AS A TEAM.
AND LOOK, I KNOW THIS WHOLE
COVID SITUATION HAS REALLY

16:57.317 --> 17:01.021
CHANGED THE GAME, SO WE GOT TO
BE SMART ABOUT THIS, OKAY?
WE'RE IN A SMALL ROOM WITH VERY

17:01.021 --> 17:03.156
LIMITED AIRFLOW.
>> GOOD CALL.
>> YEAH, GREAT THINKING,

17:03.156 --> 17:05.625
MacGRUBER.
>> OKAY, VICKI, PASS ME THAT OLD
TIN.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.295
>> YOU GOT IT, MacGRUBER.
>> PIPER, THAT LIGHTER FLUID.
>> COMING AT YOU, GRUBS.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.898
>> NOW BOTH OF YOU, HAND ME YOUR
MASKS.
>> WHAT?

17:11.898 --> 17:19.339
>> NO TIME TO EXPLAIN, MASKS
NOW!
>> MacGRUBER, WHAT ARE YOU

17:19.339 --> 17:22.342
DOING?
>> FREEING US FROM TYRANNY,
VICK.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.611
YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> WELCOME FOR WHAT?
I REALLY WANTED TO WEAR THAT

17:24.611 --> 17:27.547
MASK.
>> YEAH, YOU JUST SAID YOURSELF
THAT WE'RE IN A SMALL ENCLOSED

17:27.547 --> 17:31.317
ROOM.
>> YES, SO WE NEED EVERY DROP OF
OXYGEN WE CAN GET, WHICH IS

17:31.317 --> 17:38.491
IMPOSSIBLE WITH THESE STUPID
FACE DIAPERS.
I CAN FINALLY BREATHE.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.127
>> I'VE GOT TO SAY I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS.
>> DON'T WORRY, VICK.

17:41.127 --> 17:46.833
I'M VAXED AND RELAXED.
HERE'S PROOF.
>> I THINK THERE'S A "P" MISSING

17:46.833 --> 17:52.072
AT THE BEGINNING OF PFIZER.

BUT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU, TATUM.

21:18.078 --> 21:22.482
IS A MEDALLION THE SAME AS A
FRIGGING FLAG?
>> NO, BUT -- IT SEEMED LIKE

21:22.482 --> 21:26.186

31:56.449 --> 32:01.654
THAT'S A BAD NAME.
SO LOOK, I KNOW IT'S YOUR FIRST
TIME DOING THIS.

32:01.654 --> 32:04.791
BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT.
MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE

32:04.791 --> 32:08.428
HAS A NICE, FULFILLING
EXPERIENCE.
BUT SAFETY FIRST, OKAY?

32:08.428 --> 32:26.446
BUT SAFETY FIRST, OKAY?
LET'S SEE IF THIS BED CAN HANDLE
MY MOTION.

32:35.288 --> 32:38.391
IT'S NOT BAD.
NOT BAD.
YEAH,

32:38.391 --> 32:42.662
THIS COULD WORK.
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GET MY CIALIS HERE.

32:42.662 --> 32:47.834
THREE PILLS OUGHT TO DO IT.
>> THREE?
WOW.

32:47.834 --> 32:55.008
>> BY THE WAY, I FIND A
THREESOME WITH AMARIED COUPLE
WORKS BEST.

32:55.008 --> 32:57.744
WHEN THE WIFE AND I GO ABOUT THE
NIGHT AS IF IT'S JUST US.
AND IT'S ON THE HUSBAND TO

32:57.744 --> 32:59.212
FIGURE OUT WHEN AND HOW TO JOIN
IN.
>> THAT'S SMART.

32:59.212 --> 33:02.816
SO IT'S NOT CHAOS.
FEELING BETTER NOW?
>> NO.

33:02.816 --> 33:07.520
I'M NOT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, EXACTLY?
>> WELL, IT MEANS THAT IF YOUR

33:07.520 --> 33:10.123
WIFE AND I HAVE A GOOD RHYTHM
GOING, DON'T CROWBAR YOURSELF
IN.

33:10.123 --> 33:15.328
YOU KNOW?
REMEMBER, IT'S A THREE-WAY, NOT
A ME-WAY.

33:15.328 --> 33:20.066
>> WOW, YEAH, THAT IS SUCH A
GOOD WAY TO PUT IT.
DID YOU MAKE THAT UP?

33:20.066 --> 33:24.604
>> I DID.
YEAH.
NOW HEADS-UP, TAINT.

33:24.604 --> 33:26.906
THE MORE HEATED I GET THE HARDER
IT WILL BE FOR YOU TO GET IN
THERE.

33:26.906 --> 33:35.782
THIS DOG GETS GREEDY WITH HIS
TREATS.
>> YOU CALLED ME TAINT AGAIN.

33:35.782 --> 33:42.188
IT'S TATE.
AND JUST SO I'M CLEAR, THE GAME
PLAN FOR TONIGHT IS YOU'RE GOING

33:42.188 --> 33:45.492

LOVE TO MY WIFE ALL NIGHT AND
FIGHT ME OFF THE WHOLE TIME?

33:45.492 --> 33:50.130

WAY.

34:03.209 --> 34:07.080
>> I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND.
>> ALL RIGHTMENT TRY TO JOIN IN.

34:07.080 --> 34:14.721
>> TRY TO JOIN IN?
ALL RIGHT.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.589
>> DUDE!
YOU'RE GOING TO HIT ME WITH MY
OWN WIFE?

34:16.589 --> 34:23.496
>> YEAH, IF I HAVE TO, YEAH.
LOOK BUD, YOU WANT TO SAVE THE
SHIRE,

34:23.496 --> 34:25.231
YOU GOT TO GET THROUGH MORDOR
FIRST.
>> YES, THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO

34:25.231 --> 34:28.868
SEE TONIGHT, MY MAN FIGHTING FOR
ME.
GOD,

34:28.868 --> 34:35.608
I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.
>> NOW, I MENTIONED IN MY E-MAIL
I'M A SWEATER.

34:35.608 --> 34:40.547
>> YES.
WE HAVE EVERYTHING YOU ASKED
FOR.

34:40.547 --> 34:45.652
11 FULL SIZE BATH TOWELS AND A
TARP TO PUT OVER THE BED.
>> YES.

34:45.652 --> 34:50.857
THE TARP IS OPTIONAL.
BUT, AGAIN, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
HOW MUCH I SWEAT.

34:50.857 --> 34:56.463
OKAY.
SPEAKING OF, TAINT, DURING SOME
OF YOUR DOWN TIME, I MIGHT CALL

34:56.463 --> 35:12.379
FOR A TOWEL.
GO AHEAD AND CALL FOR A FRESHY.
>> LOOK, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

35:12.379 --> 35:14.814
HAVE A LOT TO DO SO I FIGURED
YOU'D WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE.
OKAY.

35:14.814 --> 35:16.883
LAST THING, TAINT, THROW THIS
MASK ON.
>> WHAT IS THIS?

35:16.883 --> 35:19.686
>> I DON'T LIKE SEEING A DUDE'S
FACE WHEN I'M DOING MY THING.
NOW IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT EVEN

35:19.686 --> 35:24.157
HERE.
>> OH, YES.

35:26.292 --> 35:29.429
SO SHOULD WE START?
>> HELL YEAH.
>> OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO --

POP INTO THE BATHROOM AND WORK
THROUGH A MINOR CIALIS HEART
ATTACK REAL QUICK.

>> SO MAYBE MY WIFE AND I WILL
GET STARTED WHILE YOU'RE GONE?

GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

39:38.445 --> 39:42.282
WITH A TWO-HOUR PRESS
CONFERENCE.
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG IT TOOK

39:42.282 --> 39:45.352
TO LIST EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE
WRONG.
IT WAS ACTUALLY THE LONGEST

39:45.352 --> 39:50.423
PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCE IN
HISTORY.
BUT AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD MANY

39:50.423 --> 40:04.504
TIMES BEFORE, JUST BECAUSE YOU
WENT FOR A LONG TIME DOESN'T
MEAN YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

40:04.504 --> 40:06.806
>>> SENATE REPUBLICANS LINED UP
TO SHAKE KYRSTEN SINEMA'S HAND
AFTER SHE VOTED AGAINST CHANGING

40:06.806 --> 40:08.875

RIGHTS.
AH, THE U.S. SENATE, KEEPING

40:08.875 --> 40:19.619

HANDSHAKE SINCE 1787.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS SUGGESTED

40:19.619 --> 40:27.027
PRIMARY CHALLENGERS WHO RUN
REPLACING
JOE MANCHIN AND KYRSTEN SINEMA.

40:27.027 --> 40:29.095
DAMN, BERNIE, STABBING YOUR OWN
CO-WORKERS IN THE BACK IS JUST
UNFORGIVABLE.

40:29.095 --> 40:36.403

COLIN GET FIRED NO MATTER HOW
AMAZING I THINK BOWEN WOULD BE.

STAFF MEMBERS TOLD THE JANUARY
6th COMMITTEE THAT IF TRUMP MADE

40:39.005 --> 40:41.474
AN UNSCRIPTED STATEMENT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ATTACK, HE WOULD
HAVE MADE THE SITUATION WORSE.

40:41.474 --> 40:44.744
AND I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY
SOUND ARGUMENT.
NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN LIKE, "YOU

40:44.744 --> 40:49.949
KNOW WHO WOULD BE PERFECT TO
DE-ESCALATE THIS SITUATION?
DONALD TRUMP."

40:49.949 --> 40:53.086
IF HE WAS TRYING TO TALK SOMEONE
OFF A LEDGE HE'D BE LIKE, "DON'T
JUMP.

40:53.086 --> 41:01.061

LIKE A DOG.

WAY TO GET BACK AT HER.

REALLY ISN'T THAT SURPRISING
COMING FROM A GUY WHO DRESSES
LIKE LEO IN "DJANGO UNCHAINED."

41:28.088 --> 41:30.390
>>> THIS WEEK, BRITAIN'S MOST
ELIGIBLE BACHELOR, PRINCE
ANDREW, OFFICIALLY DELETED HIS

TWITTER ACCOUNT AFTER HE

42:36.556 --> 42:39.659
CONNECTICUT?
"MAURY."
COMMENTATING OVER CRIES OF "YOU

42:39.659 --> 42:46.700
ARE NOT THE FATHER!"
AND HOW WILL YOU DESCRIBE THE
ATMOSPHERE IN THE STADIUM?

42:46.700 --> 42:52.939
LIKE
"UH, THE VIBE IS 2:00 A.M. IN
STAMFORD."

IT'S ACCURATE.
AND FUN.

WHAT IS THIS, "THE WIRE"?
MUST BE SEASON TWO BECAUSE
YOU'RE WHITE AND NO ONE CARES.

43:35.749 --> 43:39.419

CHAPPELLE SPECIAL?
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF
PEOPLE PROTESTING AFTERWARDS.

44:30.303 --> 44:33.940

SERIOUS ISSUES.

44:33.940 --> 44:35.942

STEPBROTHER'S LIFE COACH.
>> AND --

** OH, TODDLER DID YOU HEAR WHAT
I WHISPERED IN YOUR EAR ABOUT

57:26.813 --> 57:34.821
THE SPACESHIP THAT WAS PARKED IN
YOUR YARD
** WITH A TURKEY AND A TOLD

57:34.821 --> 57:42.095
** AND A FACE FULL OF REGRET
** BUT THEN A TRUCK PASSED BY
** AND NOW THE TURKEY IS BED AND

57:42.095 --> 57:51.204
THE TOLD'S ON LIFE-SUPPORT.
>> THAT'S AMAZING.
>> JUST GIVES YOU THE SHIVERS,

57:51.204 --> 57:56.843
DOESN'T IT?
AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.
SO IMPORTANTLY, YOU WANT LESS?

57:56.843 --> 57:59.512
SORRY.
BECAUSE WHILE THERE IS MORE THAN
ONE WAY TO SKIN A CAT, THERE IS

57:59.512 --> 58:08.321
ONLY ONE WAY TO PUT THAT SKIN
BACK ON, WITH BEAUTIFUL MUSIC
LIKE THIS LITTLE SLOW JELLY.

58:08.321 --> 58:18.832
** THE EYES OF GOD ARE CRYING
**
** THE TODDLERS HAVE BEEN LYING

58:18.832 --> 58:28.041
** OH, YES, THOSE LITTLE SONS OF
GUNS
** WHO TRUSTED THEM TO GUARD THE

58:28.041 --> 58:38.318
MODEL T CARS.
** AND NOW THEY'LL MEET THE
WRATH OF GOD AND BURN IN TODDLER

58:38.318 --> 58:42.756
HELL
** UNLESS THEY CALL YOUR FRIENDS
THE ALIENS TO SEND A SPACESHIP

58:42.756 --> 58:47.427
DOWN
** BUT GOD WILL FIND THEM THERE
** HE'S EVERYWHERE

58:47.427 --> 58:54.401
** HE'LL WELL CONNECTED
** AND A LIGHTENING BOLT AND
BURN THEM TO A CRISP AND DRINK A

58:54.401 --> 59:02.342
JAR OF BEER TO CELEBRATE THE
DEATH FOR LITTLE NAUGHTY
TODDLERS WHO DISRESPECT NUNS

59:02.342 --> 59:12.686
** FOR THEY WILL FIND THEMSELVES
** IN TODDLER HELL!
**

59:12.686 --> 59:19.926
** TODDLER HELL
** TODDLER HELL
** TODDLER HELL!

** AND YOUR FIELD IS STUCK FROM
THE SPACESHIP BELOW

1:04:46.086 --> 1:04:49.589
>> I'M SORRY, IN WHAT WAY?
>> JUST LOOK AT HOW YOU'RE
DRESSED.

1:04:49.589 --> 1:04:53.760
>> FORGIVE ME FOR NOT SHOPPING
AT CHEAPS-R-US LIKE YOU.
I'M JUST YOUR AVERAGE AMERICAN

1:04:53.760 --> 1:05:03.670
WHO BELIEVES IN LIMITED
GOVERNMENT, MY BODY, MY
CHOICE -- FOR MEN -- AND

1:05:03.670 --> 1:05:06.039
SUPPRESSED VOTING RIGHTS FOR
ALTERNATIVELY SKINNED PEOPLE.
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT MAKES ME

1:05:06.039 --> 1:05:10.443
BRAINWASHED.

FOR THIS.

1:05:10.443 --> 1:05:12.545

VICKY, HAND ME ALL THE REMAINS
OF AMERICA'S SOUL.
>> WHAT?

1:05:14.614 --> 1:05:21.388
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD.
LOOK, I'M JUST A SHAMAN.

1:05:21.388 --> 1:05:23.556
>> ALL I CAN DO IS PRAY FOR YOU,
TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST YOU, AND
KEEP THE OATH I TOOK TO PROTECT

1:05:23.556 --> 1:05:27.127
THIS COUNTRY.
BECAUSE I AM AN OATH KEEPER AND
BOY AM I PROUD OF THAT.

1:05:27.127 --> 1:05:30.463
WHICH I GUESS MAKES ME A PROUD
BOY.
>> DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT

1:05:30.463 --> 1:05:32.899
YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW?
>> PROBABLY NOT.
>> MacGRUBER, IF WE DON'T DEAL

1:05:32.899 --> 1:05:36.503
WITH THIS BOMB, WE ARE GOING TO
EXPLODE.
>> 5 SECONDS.

1:05:36.503 --> 1:05:39.105
>> ACCORDING TO CNN.
>> 4 SECONDS.
>> CANCEL CULTURE.

1:05:39.105 --> 1:05:41.241
>> 3 SECONDS.
>> NOT MY CLOCK.
>> 2 SECONDS.

1:05:41.241 --> 1:05:45.612
>> HOLLYWOOD ELITE.
>> 1 SECOND.
>> THOUGH I DO KIND OF LIKE SOME

1:05:45.612 --> 1:05:48.915
>> THOUGH I DO KIND OF LIKE SOME
STREAMERS ON PEACOCK.
