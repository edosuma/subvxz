Boy, it must be rough

00:10.173 --> 00:12.273
<i>Wait, hold on.
Don't lock it yet.</i>

00:13.310 --> 00:16.277
Yeah, there we go.

00:16.312 --> 00:18.680
- Mmm.
- That makes four.

00:18.715 --> 00:20.715
- Mm-hmm.
- You're eating all the profits.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.584
How'd you ever even get a license?

00:22.619 --> 00:23.785
'Cause I look good in a suit.

00:23.820 --> 00:25.220
[chuckles]

00:27.257 --> 00:30.458
How long has the parking
lot camera been down?

00:30.493 --> 00:35.163
I have no idea.
Isn't that your job?

00:35.198 --> 00:36.397
Finish locking up, would ya?

00:36.433 --> 00:38.132
I'm gonna go check out the camera.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.835
I will not be going home tonight
if that thing's busted.

00:44.474 --> 00:47.208
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

- What is it? What's wrong?

01:30.320 --> 01:32.654
What ... What's wrong?
What are you doing here?

01:32.689 --> 01:36.891
Um...
I-I was just stopping by.

01:36.926 --> 01:40.662
- You were watching us.
- No.

01:40.697 --> 01:42.363
How long have you been
sneaking in?

01:42.399 --> 01:44.399
It's not sneaking.
I have a key.

01:44.434 --> 01:49.404
I understand the nervousness,
but this is not a solution.

01:49.439 --> 01:52.273
<i>It's just until we catch him, Maura.</i>

01:52.309 --> 01:54.175
[sighs]

01:56.713 --> 01:58.313
You need to talk to someone.

01:58.348 --> 02:01.382
Melanie has been really helpful.

02:01.418 --> 02:02.717
She's given me a lot of tools

02:02.752 --> 02:04.652
to help me cope
with having been abducted.

02:04.688 --> 02:09.657
Every time I feel anxious or scared,
I just write it in my journal.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.859
It's a way of avoiding
the onset of P.T.S.D.

02:11.895 --> 02:14.295
So what are you doing up
in the middle of the night?

02:15.832 --> 02:17.865
It's a process.

02:17.901 --> 02:19.901
All right, well, we'll see
how your therapy goes,

02:19.936 --> 02:21.769
and maybe I'll consider
talking to somebody.

02:21.805 --> 02:25.473

- [whispers] Quit it!
- You could have ironed it.

02:54.771 --> 02:56.571
You have bags under your eyes.

02:56.606 --> 02:58.973
I don't have bags

02:59.008 --> 03:02.510
- Gotcha.
- Anyone hungry?

03:02.545 --> 03:04.512

- What? Robbery gone bad?
- First unit on the scene

03:14.624 --> 03:16.424
<i>talked to the security
guard, Jeff Collins.</i>

03:16.459 --> 03:18.292
He said he and the owner,
Otis Reynolds,

03:18.328 --> 03:19.594
were closing up for the night.

03:21.231 --> 03:23.765
- Should she be back so soon?
- W...

03:25.368 --> 03:28.136
Yeah. It's good for her to get
into her regular routine.

03:28.171 --> 03:29.304
Keeps her mind focused.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.005
What's with the security cameras?

03:31.041 --> 03:33.408
Collins noticed that the parking
lot camera was malfunctioning.

03:33.443 --> 03:35.444
When he went to check
it out, two masked guys

03:35.445 --> 03:37.445
with guns were at the
door, forced their way in.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.746
Do we know how they
disabled the cameras?

03:38.782 --> 03:41.549
Wiring appears intact. We're
taking it back to the crime lab.

03:41.585 --> 03:43.585
Collins said Reynolds was
trying to lock the safe,

03:43.620 --> 03:47.455
and the bad guys came in
and that one started shooting.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.724
Mm, to keep Otis
from locking everything up.

03:49.759 --> 03:53.194
- Otis took a round to the head.
- Is he alive?

03:53.230 --> 03:55.597
Surgeon said it's a miracle
he's still alive, but he is.

03:55.632 --> 03:57.699
Our victim has a single
close contact gunshot wound

03:57.734 --> 04:01.369
- to the chest, no exit wound.
- What about the guard?

04:01.404 --> 04:03.705
Took one to the chest and still
managed to shoot our dead guy.

04:03.740 --> 04:06.074
The vest saved his life,
but he is hurtin'.

04:06.109 --> 04:08.276
He passed out, called 9-1-1
when he came to.

04:08.311 --> 04:10.245
He didn't say anything
about the second guy?

04:10.280 --> 04:12.480
No, just that it happened
in the blink of an eye.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.350
Well... [sighs]

04:15.385 --> 04:17.252
if the accomplice is trying
to get to the money,

04:17.286 --> 04:19.387
I mean, he ... he would've left
a bloody footprint.

04:19.422 --> 04:21.255
Well, maybe the gunplay
scared him off.

04:21.291 --> 04:22.724
Yeah.

04:22.759 --> 04:25.793
Hey, can you bag that up
and get it to the crime lab?

04:25.829 --> 04:29.130
Maybe our accomplice needed
something to calm his nerves.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.799
And that's a lot of dough.

04:31.835 --> 04:33.801
Mm-hmm. And until the state
and federal drug laws

04:33.837 --> 04:35.954
catch up to each other,
little places like this

04:35.955 --> 04:37.538
are always gonna have
a lot of cash lying around.

04:37.574 --> 04:40.675
- It's a gold rush.
- It's a green rush.

04:42.312 --> 04:43.845
And with that much green,

04:43.880 --> 04:45.446
there's always gonna be someone
who wants to steal it.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.122
- You're tracking airline flights?
- [chuckles] No.

04:54.157 --> 04:56.291
This is about not being able
to find a link

04:56.326 --> 04:58.660
between Maura's kidnapper,
Joe Harris, and Jane.

04:58.695 --> 05:01.763
Since Harris leads us nowhere,
I circled back to the hacker

05:01.798 --> 05:03.498
who broke into
your sister's bank accounts.

05:03.533 --> 05:05.833
Hoping that he can lead us
to whoever's behind all this.

05:05.869 --> 05:08.336
Exactly.
This is wingate bouncing.

05:08.371 --> 05:10.171
Hacker's hiding his I.P. address

05:10.206 --> 05:12.440
by bouncing the signal
to hundreds of servers.

05:12.475 --> 05:14.108
The only thing I've learned so far

05:14.144 --> 05:16.077
is how badly this guy
does not want to be found.

05:16.112 --> 05:19.380
Speaking of found, you got
anything on our dead robber?

05:19.416 --> 05:21.649
- Theodore "Teddy" White.
- Oh.

05:21.685 --> 05:24.852
35 years old from Charlestown.
[computer beeps]

05:24.888 --> 05:28.823
Two-bit thief, marijuana dealer.
Did time for both.

05:28.858 --> 05:30.858
He's been caught for almost
everything he's ever done.

05:30.894 --> 05:33.828
Someone should've told him
to pick another line of work.

05:33.863 --> 05:35.430
Any luck with the other videos
we pulled?

05:35.465 --> 05:38.366
No. The Pot Palace parking
lot camera was down.

05:38.401 --> 05:40.468
None of the city traffic cameras
caught anything,

05:40.503 --> 05:42.904
and I came up empty on private
security cameras in the area.

05:42.939 --> 05:45.473
All right, yeah, e-mail Maura
and Jane this stuff on White.

05:45.508 --> 05:47.608
I'm gonna start the paperwork
on a search warrant.

05:47.644 --> 05:49.777
Maybe we'll have better luck
at his apartment.

05:52.549 --> 05:54.382
<i>Kent: There once was a man from Kent,</i>

05:54.417 --> 05:58.453
- whose name, in fact, was Kent.
- Mm, ceiling is eating Kent. Good.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.388
<i>Be happy I'm not wearing
the kilt today.</i>

06:00.423 --> 06:03.658
- He's fixing the exhaust fan.
- What about a call to maintenance?

06:03.693 --> 06:06.127
Oh, that would take a month.
Besides, this satisfies

06:06.162 --> 06:08.796
the basic male need to fix things.

06:08.832 --> 06:11.232
<i>[sighs] For your information,</i>

06:11.267 --> 06:14.469
I once made an air conditioner of
a laptop fan and some ice cubes.

06:14.504 --> 06:18.906
- So I've got this, okay? [tools clatter]
- We'll see.

06:18.942 --> 06:21.743
Look what I found
in Teddy White's pocket.

06:21.778 --> 06:23.344
[click] A laser pointer.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.813
Mm-hmm. And if directed
at the camera lens,

06:25.849 --> 06:28.583
the concentrated beam
literally blinds the camera

06:28.618 --> 06:31.419
by destroying the C.C.D./C.M.O.S. sensor.

06:31.454 --> 06:34.655
So the camera can't "C-anymore."
Get it?

06:34.691 --> 06:36.290
<i>[metal bangs]
Ow!</i>

06:36.326 --> 06:38.457
<i>[strained voice] I'm okay!</i>

06:39.596 --> 06:42.597
Ballistics confirmed that
Collins' gun killed Teddy White.

06:42.632 --> 06:47.769
Okay. And all the other
bullets came from White's gun.

06:47.804 --> 06:50.805
And there are no prints
on the gun either. Great.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.306
What about the bloody brownie?

06:52.342 --> 06:55.610
Uh, still being processed for D.N.A.,
but more than likely, it's Otis'.

06:55.645 --> 06:58.646
[ladder rattles] The hospital tox screen
showed high levels of T.H.C. in his blood.

06:58.681 --> 07:00.381
Shocking.

07:03.286 --> 07:04.485
[switch clicks]

07:04.521 --> 07:06.721
[fan whirring]

07:06.756 --> 07:08.623
Well, all this talk of brownies

07:08.658 --> 07:11.759
makes me realize
I haven't eaten. Lunch?

07:11.795 --> 07:13.528
I can't.
I gotta interview a witness.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.498
But I'll catch you later.

07:21.504 --> 07:23.204
Gotta stop meeting like this.

07:23.239 --> 07:25.606
Dr. Kaplan, you say the sweetest things.

07:25.642 --> 07:27.675
No, really. Someday,
we have to meet in my office.

07:27.710 --> 07:29.343
People do it all the time.

07:29.379 --> 07:31.646
They call, they make an appointment,

07:31.681 --> 07:33.581
they come in and lie on my couch.

07:33.616 --> 07:38.486
- Come and see for yourself.
- I-I like this spot.

07:38.521 --> 07:39.987
[chuckles]

07:40.023 --> 07:42.423
It affords you a 360-degree
view of your surroundings,

07:42.459 --> 07:44.459
and it's not patrolled by Boston cops.

07:44.494 --> 07:45.993
Well, you're a... doctor.

07:46.029 --> 07:48.362
You should know that sunshine
is good for you.

07:48.398 --> 07:49.897
And, you know, it's...

07:49.933 --> 07:53.534
not like I see you
every Tuesday at 10:00, so...

07:53.570 --> 07:55.603
12 meetings in 5 years

07:55.638 --> 07:58.673
is enough to constitute
a professional relationship.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.374
Next time in my office.

08:00.410 --> 08:03.511
Fine, but I'm not bringing
you coffee. [chuckles]

08:05.949 --> 08:09.450
I, uh, read about Dr. Isles' abduction.

08:11.287 --> 08:13.150
I'm guessing that's why you're here.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.924
You find it difficult to see
someone you care about in danger?

08:16.960 --> 08:21.529
Well, yeah.
It's ... it's...

08:21.564 --> 08:26.968
hard to see a-a strong woman
like Maura, you know, just...

08:27.003 --> 08:31.339
crippled by fear and anxiety.
It's...

08:31.374 --> 08:33.374
She's starting to lose her confidence.

08:33.409 --> 08:34.909
She's second-guessing herself.

08:34.943 --> 08:38.312
Dr. Isles is not my client.
You are.

08:38.347 --> 08:42.750
- I'm asking about you.
- No, I'm fine.

08:42.784 --> 08:47.855
- I-I-I am fine.
- Then why'd you want to see me?

08:47.891 --> 08:50.424
You know, I remember
when you first called me

08:50.460 --> 08:54.462
to come meet you here.
Those scars were very new.

08:56.966 --> 09:01.536
Yeah, it was, uh...
right after I caught Hoyt.

09:01.571 --> 09:06.407
Some wounds heal with stitches
and a band-aid.

09:06.442 --> 09:09.577
Others require more time.

09:09.612 --> 09:13.163
All of them require a helping hand.

09:13.983 --> 09:17.307
I'm not wounded.
[chuckles]

09:19.571 --> 09:24.167
[music]

09:30.145 --> 09:33.346
Professor Gray. I read your
smackdown of the hackers

09:33.381 --> 09:35.748
who broke into the S.S.A. computers.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.384
Pissed and fighting
for the good guys.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.954
[chuckles]
[flips page]

09:43.291 --> 09:46.176
I figured the guy who wrote
that article would help me

09:46.177 --> 09:49.362
stop someone from hurting
a cop's family and friends.

09:50.265 --> 09:52.498
What? Oh.

09:52.534 --> 09:55.301
Yes, that was absolutely...
horrible.

09:55.337 --> 09:58.271
What is it you wanted me
to do again?

09:58.306 --> 10:02.141
I know how this hacker hides.
I just don't know how to find him.

10:04.579 --> 10:06.045
The trick is to find
that piece of himself

10:06.081 --> 10:10.450
that every hacker leaves
in their work. A signature.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.185
Where do I find that?

10:12.370 --> 10:15.605
If the hacker's good,
you never find it.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.088
And this guy's good.

10:22.213 --> 10:27.216
Professor Gray?
There must be something I can do.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.720
Yes. Yes, there is.
Leave this stuff with me.

10:32.390 --> 10:34.524
I thought you said
we'd never find his signature.

10:34.559 --> 10:37.160
No, I said you would never find it.

10:37.195 --> 10:40.769
I did not say I couldn't.

10:44.202 --> 10:46.369
<i>[groans]
It's three broken ribs...</i>

10:46.404 --> 10:48.404
[grunts] bruised spleen,
and some...

10:48.439 --> 10:51.440
[inhales sharply]
major blunt force trauma.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.775
You feel up to looking at a photo?

10:52.810 --> 10:56.512
- I'll do whatever I can to help.
- You seen him before?

10:56.548 --> 10:59.482
<i>Customer, maybe?
Hanging around the parking lot?</i>

10:59.517 --> 11:01.450
No. [scoffs]

11:01.486 --> 11:04.987
I can't believe I just opened the door.

11:05.023 --> 11:06.722
I just let him walk right in and ...

11:06.758 --> 11:09.058
<i>Woman: Don't blame yourself.</i>

11:09.093 --> 11:11.127
I just came by here to thank you.

11:11.162 --> 11:14.204
The surgeon said getting
Otis to the hospital

11:14.205 --> 11:18.267
when they did saved his life.
You saved his life, Jeff.

11:18.303 --> 11:21.537
<i>I didn't mean to interrupt.</i>

11:21.573 --> 11:24.540
I'm Christine Reynolds,
Otis's wife.

11:24.576 --> 11:28.744
Sergeant Vince Korsak,
Boston Homicide.

11:28.780 --> 11:32.381
- How is your husband doing?
- Still in a coma.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.183
Did you work at the Pot Palace, too?

11:34.219 --> 11:38.454
Yes, I work there.
Mostly bookkeeping at home,

11:38.489 --> 11:42.058
but I work behind the counter
two or three days a week.

11:42.093 --> 11:44.694
Have you seen anything strange
around the store this week?

11:44.729 --> 11:46.395
Someone hanging around outside?

11:46.431 --> 11:47.730
No.

11:47.765 --> 11:50.066
Were there any problems
with employees?

11:50.101 --> 11:52.602
No, we have four... part-timers

11:52.637 --> 11:55.471
and... my husband and me, sergeant.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.840
And Otis wanted it that way ...

11:57.875 --> 12:00.376
a small, owner-operated
corner store.

12:00.411 --> 12:02.211
Did Otis owe anyone money?

12:02.247 --> 12:04.447
Anyone that might have robbed
the store to get it back?

12:04.482 --> 12:08.584
- Oh, God, no.
- Do you recognize him?

12:08.620 --> 12:11.743
I've never seen him before.

12:12.423 --> 12:16.192
Otis is the most wonderful,
peaceful man.

12:16.227 --> 12:19.176
No one would want to hurt him.

12:20.765 --> 12:23.532
[music]

12:26.871 --> 12:29.372
Oh! Jane, I was just trying to find you.

12:29.407 --> 12:31.507
- What's up?
- Uh...

12:31.542 --> 12:33.242
- No, d...
- Stay.

12:33.278 --> 12:35.244
Now before you get to your desk,

12:35.280 --> 12:38.247
- I just want you to know that, uh...
- Martinez.

12:38.283 --> 12:43.252
- Martinez is here.
- Hi!

12:43.288 --> 12:45.154
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

12:47.158 --> 12:50.126
I mean ... I mean, not...
my pleasure.

12:50.161 --> 12:51.794
I-I mean, everyone's pleased,
I'm sure.

12:51.829 --> 12:54.530
He's not. Um... but...

12:54.565 --> 12:55.731
<i>Hola.</i>

12:55.767 --> 12:58.901
Hi.
Mm-kay.

12:59.086 --> 13:02.822
As you all know, I've been on
loan to the D.E.A. task force.

13:02.857 --> 13:04.490
We've been working
a series of robberies

13:04.525 --> 13:07.560
along the Massachusetts border.
Small crew hitting

13:07.595 --> 13:09.762
small town, mom-and-pop
medical marijuana operations.

13:09.797 --> 13:12.431
Makes sense. Small towns,
small police departments.

13:12.467 --> 13:14.934
They don't have the personnel
to handle that kind of operation.

13:14.969 --> 13:16.735
You think your crew hit the Pot Palace?

13:16.771 --> 13:19.538
Possibly. Two masked man enter
near closing time

13:19.574 --> 13:20.940
when there were no customers,

13:20.975 --> 13:23.776
grabbing the cash
and the marijuana on display.

13:23.811 --> 13:25.911
Our guys were in and out in 35 seconds.

13:25.947 --> 13:28.948
- Can we tie Teddy White to these crimes?
- Not yet.

13:28.983 --> 13:32.918
This is where we thought they
would hit next. Nina? [beep]

13:32.954 --> 13:34.920
A small dispensary in Wellesley,
right off Route 9.

13:34.956 --> 13:37.525
<i>D.E.A.'s already set up on the place.</i>

13:38.359 --> 13:39.959
You guys want in?

13:41.896 --> 13:44.063
[bag rustles]

13:47.902 --> 13:51.003
Dude, what if I smoke this
all up and I don't like it?

13:51.038 --> 13:54.406
Is there, like, some kind
of refund policy?

13:54.442 --> 13:58.677
Sure is, dude.
Just return the smoke in this jar,

13:58.713 --> 14:01.597
and we'll totally give you a refund.
[glass lid clinks]

14:02.316 --> 14:03.849
That's really cool, dude.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.684
- Far out, right?
- [laughs] Yeah!

14:05.720 --> 14:09.071
- Yeah, right on, man.
- Whoo!

14:11.222 --> 14:13.642
<i>[static hisses] Korsak:
Note to self ... I hate retail.</i>

14:13.677 --> 14:14.256
[static hisses]

14:19.897 --> 14:22.698
You look tired.

14:22.733 --> 14:27.002
Well, sitting in a car
watching nothing is boring.

14:27.038 --> 14:28.971
You know, I heard about
what happened.

14:31.642 --> 14:35.744
- How you doing?
- I'm all right. I'm just tired.

14:43.054 --> 14:45.587
I've been sleeping
on Maura's couch,

14:45.623 --> 14:47.623
trying to keep an eye on things.

14:47.658 --> 14:51.060
Wouldn't surveillance cameras be easier?

14:51.095 --> 14:54.530
Yes, but there's a hacker involved,

14:54.565 --> 14:56.899
and I'm worried about him
stealing the signal, so...

15:01.105 --> 15:02.738
You talking to anyone?

15:02.773 --> 15:06.642
- You can't be serious.
- Hey, why not?

15:06.677 --> 15:10.479
After that incident in Dorchester,
I saw a therapist for a few months.

15:10.514 --> 15:12.214
I was having pretty bad dreams.

15:12.249 --> 15:15.284
- I know. I remember.
- So?

15:21.625 --> 15:24.193
All right.

15:24.228 --> 15:29.998
In my dream, I chase a killer
into a-a crowd of people.

15:30.034 --> 15:31.533
But I can't see any faces.

15:31.569 --> 15:34.036
I-I can't see who's good
or who's bad,

15:34.071 --> 15:36.839
and I just keep spinning.

15:36.874 --> 15:41.243
And I just keep circling, and...

15:41.278 --> 15:44.980
and then, I-I don't see
the knife until it's too late.

15:45.015 --> 15:49.651
- And then I wake up.
- What do you think it means?

15:49.687 --> 15:54.757
In the dream, if...
I just had a little more time...

15:54.792 --> 15:58.627
You know? Like, I-I could see
his face. I could catch him.

15:58.662 --> 16:03.165
But he's always just out of reach.

16:04.635 --> 16:08.621
- It's...
- Maybe you need to let someone

16:08.622 --> 16:10.205
else carry the ball for a while.

16:10.241 --> 16:12.941
My family is in danger.

16:12.977 --> 16:15.844
You know this guy isn't gonna stop.

16:17.648 --> 16:20.408
Then I guess you're gonna
have to find him.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.088
[tires screech]

16:29.660 --> 16:30.959
[brakes squeal]

16:30.995 --> 16:32.795
[door creaks]

16:35.366 --> 16:37.290
[static hisses]
Get ready. They're here.

16:37.701 --> 16:38.734
[door squeaks]

16:38.769 --> 16:40.803
[racks shotgun]

16:40.838 --> 16:43.742
Boston police.
Drop it or die.

16:50.294 --> 16:52.427
<i>Martinez: Your partner's dead. </i>

16:52.463 --> 16:54.396
What the hell?
When did that happen?

16:54.431 --> 16:56.031
The night you hit the Pot Palace.

16:56.066 --> 16:59.134
Wanna explain
the gun in your waistband?

16:59.169 --> 17:01.937
I found that. I didn't want
some kid to pick it up.

17:01.972 --> 17:05.641
You're a nice guy, helping out
the community like that.

17:05.675 --> 17:08.210
That's why I gave my friend
a ride to the store.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.378
Do you know just being a lookout
is felony murder?

17:10.414 --> 17:13.115
- Do you know that?
- Life in prison, no parole.

17:13.150 --> 17:17.419
Look... I don't know what
happened, okay, in that store,

17:17.454 --> 17:19.954
but I-I-I-I didn't hurt anybody.

17:19.990 --> 17:24.226
I'm a thief. A thief.
Not a killer, all right?

17:24.261 --> 17:26.228
You tell us what happened
inside of Pot Palace.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.563
We talk to the D.A., maybe
they knock it down to accessory.

17:28.599 --> 17:30.465
I wasn't in the Pot Palace.
I've never been there.

17:30.501 --> 17:32.000
Where were you last night
around midnight?

17:32.036 --> 17:35.070
In Brockton, at the Motel 24 with Todd.

17:35.105 --> 17:39.341
Brockton. This little place
called, uh, uh, 24 Motel.

17:39.376 --> 17:42.010
Uh, Wally and I,
we were there all night.

17:42.046 --> 17:43.712
We ordered some pizza, had
a little party with some girls.

17:43.747 --> 17:46.581
- What are their names?
- Jasmine and, um...

17:46.617 --> 17:48.350
Ah. Cinnamon.

17:48.385 --> 17:52.054
Yeah, Cinnamon.
[chuckles] Cinnamon.

17:52.089 --> 17:55.090
[music]

17:59.263 --> 18:01.096
[indistinct conversations]

18:01.131 --> 18:03.098
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm?

18:03.133 --> 18:06.068
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. [inhales deeply]

18:06.103 --> 18:08.070
Yeah, I just need to get some sleep.

18:08.105 --> 18:10.372
<i>[yawns]
For, like, a week or two.</i>

18:10.407 --> 18:12.474
You should let me
take Ma home tonight.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.145
All right, spill the beans.
What's going on?

18:17.181 --> 18:19.214
She's been taking
our mother home every night

18:19.249 --> 18:22.117
- after her shift.
- Well, no wonder you're so tired.

18:22.152 --> 18:24.353
You can't burn your candle
at both ends like that.

18:24.388 --> 18:27.356
- That's what I told her.
- Do you have any useful information,

18:27.391 --> 18:30.258
or are you just trolling
the halls, causing problems?

18:31.595 --> 18:35.030
Wally Johnson and Todd Davis'
phone records.

18:35.065 --> 18:37.366
They were in the area of all
of the out-of-state robberies.

18:37.401 --> 18:41.269
- But not the Pot Palace?
- I went to Brockton this morning.

18:41.305 --> 18:43.605
Wally and Todd checked
into the Motel 24

18:43.640 --> 18:46.608
the night of the robbery,
left the next morning.

18:46.643 --> 18:48.276
Pizza delivery guy I.D.'d
'em from their photos.

18:48.312 --> 18:52.381
So the Pot Palace wasn't them.

18:56.653 --> 18:58.420
[sighs deeply]

19:00.057 --> 19:02.958
[thud] Lieutenant Martinez left
this for you at the front desk.

19:02.993 --> 19:04.259
Thank you.

19:15.172 --> 19:18.273
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Ma.

19:18.308 --> 19:20.575
What's that?

19:20.611 --> 19:25.080
Wireless cameras.
Paid for by the D.E.A.

19:25.115 --> 19:26.348
Don't touch.
[scoffs]

19:26.383 --> 19:28.316
N.S.A. crypto technology
prevents anyone

19:28.352 --> 19:30.018
from intercepting the signal.

19:30.054 --> 19:33.155
Oh. Does that mean you're
gonna start sleeping?

19:33.190 --> 19:37.392
Or are you going to watch
cameras all night long?

19:37.428 --> 19:40.429
When I'm not watching,
someone else will.

19:40.464 --> 19:43.732
- Who?
- What?

19:43.767 --> 19:46.334
Jane, this has got to stop.

19:46.370 --> 19:50.072
You are not responsible
for me or Maura.

19:50.107 --> 19:52.674
Okay, this is about someone
who is trying to hurt,

19:52.709 --> 19:56.578
potentially kill,
the people that I love.

19:56.613 --> 20:00.248
Someone that I'm in charge
of finding. Okay?

20:00.284 --> 20:03.385
But for all we know,
whoever was behind this

20:03.420 --> 20:06.588
could've been scared off
when Joe Harris died.

20:08.258 --> 20:10.492
What if he wasn't?

20:12.529 --> 20:15.497
[music]

20:15.532 --> 20:18.467
[telephone ringing in distance,
door closes]

20:18.502 --> 20:22.137
As requested, a random sampling
of product from the Pot Palace.

20:22.172 --> 20:25.640
- For investigatory purposes only.
- I never doubted it.

20:25.676 --> 20:27.709
You say this has to do
with some inconsistency?

20:27.744 --> 20:31.179
Well, the government-sanctioned
suppliers are required by law

20:31.215 --> 20:34.483
to maintain a specific level
of T.H.C. in all their products.

20:34.518 --> 20:37.219
Yet, the bloody brownie
I was testing for D.N.A.

20:37.254 --> 20:40.288
had a significantly higher level
of T.H.C. than allowed.

20:40.324 --> 20:41.857
Meaning what?

20:41.892 --> 20:43.558
Otis was selling non-sanctioned
products in his store?

20:43.594 --> 20:45.494
Well, the discrepancy could be
an aberration

20:45.529 --> 20:47.813
in the manufacturing process.
I'll know for sure

20:47.814 --> 20:50.232
once I test the T.H.C. levels
in these samples.

20:50.267 --> 20:54.569
When you say "test,"
uh, exactly how do you do that?

20:54.605 --> 20:58.807
Well, we do burn it
in a controlled environment

20:58.842 --> 21:03.812
with proper ventilation.
It's all very scientific, I promise.

21:03.847 --> 21:04.846
[laughs]

21:07.251 --> 21:10.585
[telephone ringing in distance,
indistinct conversations]

21:14.324 --> 21:16.158
[coffeemaker beeps]

21:16.193 --> 21:17.626
Anything new on Wally and Todd?

21:17.661 --> 21:20.362
Well, no,
we have found no connection

21:20.397 --> 21:23.198
between Wally and Todd
and Teddy White.

21:23.233 --> 21:26.434
- Maybe it's a copycat.
- Yeah.

21:26.470 --> 21:28.470
But how does a two-bit loser

21:28.505 --> 21:30.906
who can barely plan
a subway ride know how

21:30.941 --> 21:33.608
to disable a security camera
with a laser pointer?

21:33.644 --> 21:35.628
Did we find any connection
between Teddy White

21:35.629 --> 21:37.612
and the employees at the
store? [cell phone buzzes]

21:37.648 --> 21:39.614
Not yet, but Nina's still
working on it. [buzzing continues]

21:39.650 --> 21:41.883
We gotta find an accomplice.
[cell phone beeps]

21:41.919 --> 21:43.618
Hey, Maura, what's up?

21:43.654 --> 21:44.920
[telephone ringing in distance]

21:44.955 --> 21:48.690
No, I do not have
Prince Albert in a can.

21:50.394 --> 21:53.361
Yes, my refrigerator is running.

21:53.397 --> 21:57.666
Where are you?
Are you in the lab?

21:57.701 --> 22:01.970
Y-You know, if you could just
stop with the laughing, I...

22:04.508 --> 22:05.874
[Kent giggling]

22:05.909 --> 22:09.344
Why can you not trust atoms?

22:09.379 --> 22:11.613
Because they make up everything.
[cell phone beeps]

22:11.648 --> 22:14.649
[both laughing]

22:17.621 --> 22:20.222
You've got the fan
pushing the smoke in.

22:20.257 --> 22:25.393
- You wired the fan wrong.
- You wired the fan bong!

22:25.429 --> 22:27.262
[both laughing]

22:27.297 --> 22:28.897
<i>You know, just interesting fact ...</i>

22:28.932 --> 22:31.299
that might be the
biggest bong in history.

22:31.335 --> 22:33.535
[both laughing]
Okay. Let's go.

22:33.570 --> 22:35.270
Get up!
Get up, get up.

22:35.305 --> 22:37.572
[speaks indistinctly]
[groans] Get up! Get up!

22:37.608 --> 22:39.774
[continues laughing]

22:39.810 --> 22:44.283
Get out! Get out!
[both guffawing]

22:47.951 --> 22:50.785
- Oh!
- I'm over here.

22:50.821 --> 22:52.387
[smack]
Oh?

22:52.422 --> 22:54.422
[both stifling laughter]

22:54.458 --> 22:55.790
[Kent clears throat]

22:55.826 --> 22:58.426
The tests that I've been
running on the edibles...

22:58.462 --> 23:00.829
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I'm so hungry!

23:00.864 --> 23:04.532
Oh, yeah.
[whines]

23:04.568 --> 23:07.335
- What are you doing?
- Looking for corn curls.

23:07.371 --> 23:09.938
- In my hair?
- Yeah.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.507
[laughing]
Corn curls in your curls!

23:12.542 --> 23:14.342
[laughs]

23:14.378 --> 23:16.411
Maura... focus.

23:16.446 --> 23:18.280
- Okay?
- Okay.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.581
- Tell me about...
- Hmm.

23:19.616 --> 23:21.416
the tests on the edibles.

23:21.451 --> 23:24.286
- On the edibles.
- Mm-hmm.

23:24.321 --> 23:26.821
Oh, yeah!

23:26.857 --> 23:29.958
[lowered voice] Some of Otis' brownies

23:29.993 --> 23:33.561
did not come from
his government supplier.

23:33.597 --> 23:35.030
Shh.

23:35.065 --> 23:38.099
He was gettin' some
M.J. from the street.

23:38.135 --> 23:42.037
- Word.
- I can't. Just...

23:42.072 --> 23:44.739
Oh, you know, I have never
told you this before...

23:44.775 --> 23:49.611
- Oh, God.
- But I love glazed doughnuts.

23:49.646 --> 23:50.912
Okay! I'll...

23:50.947 --> 23:52.380
[both laughing]

23:52.416 --> 23:54.783
[phone beeps]
I will get you some.

23:54.818 --> 23:57.952
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

23:57.988 --> 23:59.421
[stifles laugh]

23:59.456 --> 24:01.022
Nina, can you send
the phone records

24:01.058 --> 24:03.458
from Otis and the Pot Palace
over to Martinez, please?

24:03.493 --> 24:05.361
Thanks so much! Bye!
[cell phone beeps]

24:05.396 --> 24:06.061
[continues laughing]

24:06.096 --> 24:10.465
Do you know what a scientist
plants in his garden?

24:10.500 --> 24:11.733
No.

24:11.768 --> 24:16.171
<i>[both unisono] A chemistree!
[laughing]</i>

24:24.877 --> 24:28.544
- So how's the 420 gang doing?
- [chuckles] Fine,

24:28.580 --> 24:32.015
once I got 'em six bags
of chips and some fresh air.

24:32.050 --> 24:34.851
Okay, so it's pretty obvious
from Maura's report

24:34.886 --> 24:37.820
that Otis is supplementing
his brownie inventory.

24:37.856 --> 24:40.757
It's a good plan. Sell your
own home-baked brownies,

24:40.792 --> 24:43.426
cut the government out of it,
pocket a bunch of tax-free cash.

24:43.461 --> 24:45.128
Yeah, all he'd need is
a street dealer.

24:45.163 --> 24:46.963
And for someone who sells
legal marijuana for a living,

24:46.998 --> 24:48.631
how hard could that be to find?

24:48.667 --> 24:51.401
If Otis was stupid enough
to burn someone in a deal,

24:51.436 --> 24:53.970
it wouldn't surprise me
if that robbery was staged.

24:54.005 --> 24:56.572
Otis is killed, the dispute is resolved,

24:56.608 --> 24:57.907
and it doesn't kick back on the dealer.

24:57.942 --> 24:59.609
[telephone ringing in distance]

24:59.644 --> 25:00.910
I sent the Pot Palace phone records

25:00.945 --> 25:02.512
to Martinez and the D.E.A.
like you asked.

25:02.547 --> 25:03.913
He cross-referenced them

25:03.948 --> 25:06.816
against their database
of suspected dealers.

25:06.851 --> 25:08.985
They got a hit.

25:09.020 --> 25:12.388
[TV playing indistinctly]

25:12.424 --> 25:14.924
I have never seen an operation
this big in Boston.

25:14.959 --> 25:18.561
Say thanks to the modern marvel
of advanced hydroponics.

25:18.596 --> 25:21.464
You're mixing up the Sativa
and the Indica with the hybrids.

25:21.499 --> 25:24.367
- Who's in charge here?
- We are.

25:24.402 --> 25:25.702
All right, well, you ...

25:25.737 --> 25:27.637
can you tell me
what the hell is going on here?

25:27.672 --> 25:31.374
Because you're taking, like,
all of my product.

25:31.409 --> 25:33.976
Well, it's illegal to grow
and sell marijuana.

25:34.012 --> 25:37.580
Not anymore. It's legal in
the State of Massachusetts.

25:37.615 --> 25:39.782
If you have a grower's permit.

25:39.818 --> 25:42.418
Do you have yours handy, Charlie?

25:42.454 --> 25:44.654
No, I ... look, I got a friend.
He was gonna get it to me.

25:44.689 --> 25:47.457
Okay, you know what? No one
cares about your weed, all right?

25:47.492 --> 25:48.825
You can discuss that with the D.E.A.

25:48.860 --> 25:52.428
- All I care about is murder.
- Murder?

25:52.464 --> 25:55.798
Was the robbery at the Pot Palace
a setup to kill Otis Reynolds?

25:55.834 --> 25:58.101
Wait, wait.
What are you talking about?

25:58.136 --> 26:01.671
You killing Otis Reynolds
because he stiffed you on a deal.

26:01.706 --> 26:04.507
God, no. If somebody
stiffed me, I just ...

26:04.542 --> 26:07.577
- I-I wouldn't sell to them again.
- Well, that's big of you.

26:07.612 --> 26:11.581
Hey, look around, I've got
plenty of product to cover a loss.

26:11.616 --> 26:13.449
It's not like I'm gonna
kill somebody over it.

26:13.485 --> 26:14.951
You sure of that?

26:14.986 --> 26:19.122
Look at me, bro. I mean,
do I look like Pablo Escobar?

26:19.157 --> 26:20.757
I mean... [sighs]

26:20.792 --> 26:22.592
anyway, it's not ...
not the way it was with Otis.

26:22.627 --> 26:25.528
He was ...
he was a solid customer.

26:25.563 --> 26:29.232
- When's the last time you saw him?
- 15 years ago?

26:29.267 --> 26:31.701
Otis and I did
a little business together

26:31.736 --> 26:33.035
when we were in college.

26:33.071 --> 26:36.672
And then, you know, we drifted apart.

26:36.708 --> 26:39.175
But he called me, like, five months ago.

26:39.210 --> 26:43.079
- How did he get your number?
- This is the house I grew up in.

26:43.114 --> 26:45.581
And so, like,
the number's not changed.

26:45.617 --> 26:46.916
And Otis called 'cause

26:46.951 --> 26:48.751
he wanted to do some business
together again.

26:48.787 --> 26:50.720
But he didn't want to meet
face-to-face,

26:50.755 --> 26:53.523
so he just left the money
at the drop-off,

26:53.558 --> 26:58.961
and I dropped off, you know,
the package. Legally.

26:58.997 --> 27:02.565
- I'm gonna look around.
- Yeah.

27:18.550 --> 27:20.783
Can we trust you with this?

27:23.455 --> 27:24.987
Considering my body weight

27:25.023 --> 27:27.890
and the fact that I am not
a regular marijuana smoker,

27:27.926 --> 27:30.693
I do believe that the effects

27:30.728 --> 27:33.830
of the inhalation event have passed.

27:33.865 --> 27:37.099
And given my lack of a genetic
predisposition to addiction,

27:37.135 --> 27:39.235
I don't have any overwhelming desire

27:39.270 --> 27:43.539
- to smoke marijuana again.
- Mmm.

27:43.575 --> 27:45.575
<i>[mouth full] But I'm not
so sure about Kent.</i>

27:45.610 --> 27:47.477
He did seem to enjoy the effects.

27:47.512 --> 27:49.579
Oh, yeah. No, you are
the picture of decorum.

27:49.614 --> 27:51.748
Okay, can you test that, please,
and see if that's the same

27:51.749 --> 27:53.883
marijuana that we found
in the illegal brownies?

27:53.918 --> 27:57.086
Well, if I can extract plant D.N.A.

27:57.121 --> 27:59.121
from the illegal brownies,
then I can compare the two.

27:59.157 --> 28:02.158
If not, all I can test is
the same T.H.C. levels.

28:02.193 --> 28:05.661
And that won't prove conclusively
that the samples are the same.

28:05.697 --> 28:09.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Angela told me about the cameras.

28:10.034 --> 28:11.851
Yeah?

28:11.886 --> 28:14.837
I don't want them in my house.
I don't want to be watched.

28:14.873 --> 28:17.540
Okay, Maura, the cameras aren't ...

28:17.575 --> 28:21.143
Jane, stop worrying about us.
It's unhealthy.

28:21.179 --> 28:25.114
Is it as unhealthy as... being kidnapped?

28:25.149 --> 28:27.617
Or killed?

28:31.689 --> 28:34.690
My therapist showed me something.
It might help you.

28:34.726 --> 28:36.893
Oh, I can hardly wait.

28:41.232 --> 28:42.665
The glass is life.

28:42.700 --> 28:45.535
The rocks are the bad things
that happen.

28:45.570 --> 28:48.838
[rocks clatter]

28:48.873 --> 28:54.110
It looks like there's no
room left in the glass, but...

28:56.814 --> 29:00.816
the water
is the good things in life.

29:00.852 --> 29:05.187
And you ... we... need to
focus on the good things.

29:10.028 --> 29:12.028
What if somebody takes your glass?

29:19.337 --> 29:21.003
[telephone rings in distance]

29:21.039 --> 29:23.306
Is it a bad thing that
I'm being security-conscious

29:23.341 --> 29:25.041
after everything that's happened?

29:25.076 --> 29:27.109
Maura and your mother
aren't cops, Jane.

29:27.145 --> 29:30.012
They don't think they way we do.
It's just the way it is.

29:30.048 --> 29:32.882
- Oh, speaking of your mother...
- [groans] What?

29:32.917 --> 29:34.584
Did she ask you to
say something to me? What?

29:34.619 --> 29:36.018
No, no, no, not at all.

29:36.054 --> 29:37.219
I was just gonna say
I'm at the robber most nights.

29:37.255 --> 29:40.189
- I can give Angela a ride home.
- She didn't put you up to this?

29:40.224 --> 29:44.226
On my dogs. It's just my way
of watching your back.

29:44.262 --> 29:47.196
Thank you.
Listen, when you drop her off,

29:47.231 --> 29:48.164
you just gonna take a look around ...

29:48.199 --> 29:51.633
- I got your back.
- O-kay.

29:51.668 --> 29:53.336
[telephone ringing in distance]

29:53.371 --> 29:56.105
Got the list of everything
Charlie Douglas sold to Otis.

29:56.140 --> 29:58.475
From what he bought,
Otis could've baked enough

29:58.476 --> 30:00.810
pot brownies to net at
least $250,000 tax-free.

30:00.845 --> 30:04.246
Did you find an extra 250 grand
in the Pot Palace safe?

30:04.282 --> 30:07.083
Nope, all the money in the safe
balanced with the business receipts.

30:07.118 --> 30:08.884
But the records do show
a drop in sales

30:08.920 --> 30:11.321
- if they're legit brownies.
- Which is what we'd expect

30:11.322 --> 30:13.756
if Otis was pushing his product
instead of the government's.

30:13.791 --> 30:16.726
Well, Otis owned one of only
six dispensaries in Boston.

30:16.761 --> 30:19.729
That's worth millions of dollars
even after he paid taxes.

30:19.764 --> 30:20.896
Yeah, so why do something
that would cost you your license

30:20.932 --> 30:24.534
- or end you up in jail?
- Is it possible that Otis

30:24.535 --> 30:27.937
wasn't the one
goosing the inventory?

30:27.972 --> 30:30.706
I mean, Charlie said that
he hadn't seen him in years.

30:30.742 --> 30:33.209
And Otis wouldn't meet with him
face-to-face this time.

30:33.244 --> 30:35.177
You thinking an employee
pretending to be Otis

30:35.213 --> 30:36.679
picked up some brownies

30:36.714 --> 30:38.114
and sold 'em at the Pot Palace
on his own?

30:38.149 --> 30:41.350
Maybe Otis found out,
was gonna turn them in.

30:41.386 --> 30:45.120
That's certainly motive
to want him dead.

30:51.276 --> 30:53.109
[music]

30:53.144 --> 30:57.380
- Anything yet?
- No, nothing we don't already know.

30:57.415 --> 30:59.282
Otis did a great job
running background checks

30:59.317 --> 31:00.950
on these people before he hired them.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.184
[cup clatters]

31:02.220 --> 31:04.220
[sighs] Thank you.

31:04.255 --> 31:06.289
<i>It looks like all of
the employees are clean.</i>

31:06.324 --> 31:10.192
No new purchases,
no investment accounts.

31:10.228 --> 31:14.096
Jane told us to run checks
on all the employees, right?

31:14.132 --> 31:15.831
She did.

31:15.867 --> 31:19.568
Well, the wife, Christine,
is also a part-time employee.

31:19.604 --> 31:23.105
Christine Reynolds had one credit
card, but it's been paid off.

31:23.141 --> 31:25.608
Account's been closed since
the Pot Palace opened. [typing]

31:25.643 --> 31:28.077
Looks like they pay cash
for everything now.

31:28.112 --> 31:30.012
What was Christine's maiden name?

31:30.048 --> 31:32.415
[typing]

31:32.450 --> 31:35.017
- [computer beeps] Johnson.
- Okay. [types]

31:35.053 --> 31:36.619
There it is, at the same bank.

31:36.654 --> 31:40.022
A holiday account
for a Christine Johnson.

31:41.159 --> 31:46.428
The account also comes with
a free safe deposit box.

31:47.198 --> 31:50.433
[telephone ringing in distance]

31:50.468 --> 31:52.601
$240,000.

31:52.637 --> 31:54.170
Uniforms picked Christine up
at her house.

31:54.205 --> 31:55.538
They're bringing her in.

31:55.573 --> 31:57.940
<i>So she was sneaking in
the illegal brownies</i>

31:57.975 --> 32:00.209
and selling 'em right under
her husband's nose.

32:00.244 --> 32:01.944
It appears so.

32:01.979 --> 32:04.013
Why would she steal
from her husband?

32:04.048 --> 32:05.614
Maybe she was leaving him.

32:05.650 --> 32:07.883
Even though his name was
the only one on the license,

32:07.919 --> 32:09.552
wouldn't she still have a stake
in the profits

32:09.587 --> 32:11.554
- if they got divorced?
- In an ongoing business,

32:11.589 --> 32:13.522
her stake would be
less than half, if that.

32:13.558 --> 32:15.991
Best she could hope for
is a decent alimony settlement.

32:16.027 --> 32:18.461
But in an all-cash business,
Otis could play with the books,

32:18.496 --> 32:20.229
cut her out of thousands of dollars.

32:20.264 --> 32:22.298
She didn't come up with this
on her own.

32:22.333 --> 32:23.599
Someone pretended to be Otis

32:23.634 --> 32:27.036
when they were talking
to Charlie. And this..

32:27.071 --> 32:28.904
this is her protection
against Otis being pissed

32:28.940 --> 32:30.539
because she wasn't just
leaving him,

32:30.575 --> 32:33.175
- she was having an affair.
- We didn't find a burner phone

32:33.211 --> 32:34.610
when we searched her house
and her car.

32:34.645 --> 32:37.213
<i>No e-mails or love letters
on her computer.</i>

32:37.248 --> 32:38.481
Most of the calls from her cell phone

32:38.516 --> 32:39.949
were to and from the Pot Palace.

32:39.984 --> 32:42.218
And there's no connection
between Christine

32:42.253 --> 32:44.620
and Teddy White or any of
his known associates.

32:44.655 --> 32:46.655
We don't even know whether
it was a robbery

32:46.691 --> 32:48.190
or an attempt to kill Otis.

32:49.761 --> 32:52.061
Let's ask her.

32:54.399 --> 32:57.166
Did Otis know
you were stealing from him?

32:57.201 --> 33:00.369
Is that why you staged the robbery?

33:00.405 --> 33:03.134
Or did he find out about
the affair you were having?

33:03.641 --> 33:05.107
The two of you decided to kill Otis

33:05.143 --> 33:06.409
so you could start a
new life, didn't you?

33:06.444 --> 33:08.677
I would never hurt Otis.

33:08.713 --> 33:11.480
I may not love him anymore,
but I would never hurt him!

33:11.516 --> 33:13.482
Oh, sure you would,
especially if you found out

33:13.518 --> 33:16.018
that he was trying to cut you out
of your share of the store.

33:16.053 --> 33:20.623
The store was Otis's dream, not mine.
I don't want part of the store.

33:20.658 --> 33:23.626
- You expect us to believe that?
- It's the truth!

33:23.661 --> 33:25.894
Then why were you stealing from him?

33:27.398 --> 33:31.734
The money...
was just to get away,

33:31.769 --> 33:35.271
- start a new life.
- With who?

33:38.409 --> 33:41.310
[telephone ringing in distance]

33:41.345 --> 33:44.280
Yeah, and run the employee records
against the schedule, okay?

33:44.315 --> 33:46.782
Thanks.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.752
- What's up?
- Uh, so, just wanna let you know

33:49.787 --> 33:53.422
that we've tied Johnson and Davis to
all the other dispensary robberies.

33:53.458 --> 33:57.693
- But not the Pot Palace?
- No.

33:57.728 --> 34:02.631
So you haven't helped me at all with
my murder investigation. [chuckles]

34:02.667 --> 34:03.966
[sighs deeply]

34:04.001 --> 34:06.502
- You sleeping any better?
- Mm, no.

34:06.537 --> 34:09.737
But thanks for asking.
Oh. Hey.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.810
Maura's allergic to surveillance.

34:17.215 --> 34:18.746
My money's on you, Jane.

34:21.452 --> 34:23.585
Call me if you're up
in the middle of the night.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.623
[whispers] Especially if you're
up in the middle of the night.

34:27.658 --> 34:30.359
[whispers] I'm not gonna do that.

34:30.393 --> 34:32.328
I wish you would.

34:34.264 --> 34:35.731
[normal voice]
You're the best, kiddo.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.667
[sighs] Thanks.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.447
[taps keys]

34:55.520 --> 34:57.804
- [sighs] What'd you find?
- I ran the schedules

34:57.805 --> 35:00.222
of the employees,
and you were right.

35:00.258 --> 35:01.524
Christine didn't need
to call her boyfriend

35:01.559 --> 35:03.225
'cause she saw him all the time.

35:03.261 --> 35:07.563
Her schedule overlaps a lot
with Jeff Collins, the guard.

35:07.598 --> 35:09.431
Most of their days off match.

35:09.467 --> 35:11.400
And the number of calls
from the Pot Palace

35:11.435 --> 35:13.068
to the Reynolds' home were higher

35:13.104 --> 35:15.037
when Otis was working
than when he wasn't.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.473
They also correspond to the days
that Collins was working.

35:17.508 --> 35:19.275
How much you wanna bet
he was calling her

35:19.310 --> 35:23.078
- right under Otis' nose?
- And...

35:23.114 --> 35:25.414
- Yes? Something else?!
- Mm-hmm.

35:25.449 --> 35:28.017
I couldn't find a connection
between Christine and

35:28.018 --> 35:30.586
Teddy White, so I took
another look at Jeff Collins.

35:30.621 --> 35:32.221
[beep]

35:32.256 --> 35:33.756
Right here.

35:33.791 --> 35:37.092
[beeping]

35:37.128 --> 35:39.398
They went to the same gym.

35:43.134 --> 35:44.633
Where's Jane?

35:44.669 --> 35:46.635
Uh, she's a little tied up,
asked me to get the results.

35:46.671 --> 35:49.305
Oh.

35:49.340 --> 35:52.675
Well, uh, there is a significant
quantity of gunshot residue

35:52.710 --> 35:55.411
on the inside of the right
and left sleeves.

35:55.446 --> 35:57.580
Is the gunpowder the same?

35:57.615 --> 36:01.450
The G.S.R. on both sleeves
has the same chemical signature

36:01.485 --> 36:03.552
as the gunpowder from
Teddy White's weapon.

36:03.588 --> 36:05.621
Yeah, same as when I ran the first test.

36:05.656 --> 36:09.025
If he held a gun like this,
shot himself, that would

36:09.026 --> 36:12.394
explain how gunshot residue
got on both sleeves, right?

36:12.430 --> 36:14.830
Yes, or he could've been
involved in a scuffle

36:14.865 --> 36:17.166
with Teddy White,
like he said he was.

36:17.201 --> 36:19.435
Jane thinks Jeff Collins shot himself.

36:19.470 --> 36:21.236
Staged the whole thing
to look like a hero,

36:21.272 --> 36:23.772
take the suspicion off himself.

36:23.808 --> 36:25.774
Well, I know you don't want
to hear this,

36:25.810 --> 36:28.143
but there is no science
to confirm that theory.

36:28.179 --> 36:30.847
The only thing I want to
confirm right now is whether

36:30.848 --> 36:33.944
or not Christine knew that
Collins was gonna shoot Otis.

36:33.979 --> 36:35.618
[music]

36:40.460 --> 36:42.027
[music]

36:42.062 --> 36:45.530
Your boyfriend Jeff
shot and killed Teddy White,

36:45.565 --> 36:49.134
- and he shot your husband in the head.
- I don't believe you.

36:49.169 --> 36:50.602
You're just trying to
blame him for the robbery

36:50.637 --> 36:54.172
because you can't solve it!

36:54.207 --> 36:55.941
You were in the hospital room

36:55.976 --> 36:59.044
when Jeff said he didn't know
Teddy White, remember?

37:07.354 --> 37:09.688
- Jeff would never...
- Think about it.

37:09.723 --> 37:11.356
He was obsessed
with how much money

37:11.391 --> 37:13.325
Otis was making
at the dispensary, wasn't he?

37:13.360 --> 37:16.328
And it was his idea
to sell the brownies, wasn't it?

37:16.363 --> 37:18.930
And he's the one who called
Charlie Douglas

37:18.966 --> 37:20.932
pretending to be Otis, wasn't he?

37:20.968 --> 37:24.202
Did he tell you how screwed
you were gonna get?

37:24.237 --> 37:26.938
Did he tell you how Otis would
end up with the entire store,

37:26.974 --> 37:28.573
and you'd get stiffed on the alimony?

37:28.608 --> 37:32.010
- Did he tell you any of that?
- [voice breaks] No, no.

37:32.045 --> 37:34.842
Jeff would never hurt Otis!

37:35.782 --> 37:38.416
[sighs] Okay.

37:44.124 --> 37:47.292
She just can't accept
that Jeff set this all up.

37:47.327 --> 37:51.997
- You think she was in on it?
- [sighs] I think she loves Jeff,

37:52.032 --> 37:54.366
but I don't think she'd be in
on a plan to kill Otis.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.303
Okay, thanks.
[cell phone beeps]

37:58.338 --> 38:01.006
Jeff Collins was released
from the hospital this morning.

38:01.041 --> 38:02.540
I have a unit standing by Otis's room.

38:02.576 --> 38:04.509
[footsteps approach]

38:04.544 --> 38:06.277
I checked.
Collins has three handguns

38:06.313 --> 38:08.213
and two rifles registered to him.

38:08.248 --> 38:12.764
Might not be the kind of guy
to take our suspicions lying down.

38:14.554 --> 38:17.389
<i>I know that you don't wanna believe</i>

38:17.424 --> 38:20.592
that your boyfriend
shot and killed your husband.

38:20.627 --> 38:23.428
He wouldn't.

38:26.133 --> 38:29.134
Okay, well, help me prove that.

38:30.504 --> 38:34.114
Call Jeff and tell him that Otis
is gonna make a full recovery.

38:38.478 --> 38:41.513
[helicopter whirring]

38:51.758 --> 38:53.291
[footsteps approaching]

38:53.326 --> 38:55.060
<i>Jane: We moved him, Jeff,
put the rifle down.</i>

38:55.095 --> 38:57.362
Do it the easy way.
Put the gun down.

38:59.366 --> 39:03.134
- I can't believe she set me up.
- Christine didn't set you up.

39:03.170 --> 39:04.135
She just couldn't believe
you're a murderer.

39:20.654 --> 39:23.014
Tell Christine I'm sorry.

39:27.627 --> 39:29.828
[electricity buzzes]
[screams]

39:29.863 --> 39:32.330
[thud]

39:32.365 --> 39:35.533
I've never used one of these
things before. This is great!

39:35.569 --> 39:38.803
- I mean, is he all right?
- Yeah, he's all right.

39:49.916 --> 39:52.350
I swear, Jane, this is
the last time I'm gonna show up

39:52.385 --> 39:53.785
unless you have something to say.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.854
You said that last time.

40:02.696 --> 40:04.696
I'm afraid.

40:07.636 --> 40:10.916
[music]

40:17.878 --> 40:19.577
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

40:25.100 --> 40:28.319
[music]
[door opens]

40:28.355 --> 40:31.656
[door closes]

40:39.366 --> 40:42.267
I'm sorry I took your rocks.

40:42.302 --> 40:43.468
[clatter]

40:43.503 --> 40:46.571
They weren't really my rocks.

40:46.606 --> 40:49.574
They belong to the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

40:49.609 --> 40:54.245
Mmm. I gave them to
Korsak for his turtles.

40:54.281 --> 40:58.316
- He is so busted.
- I still have the glass.

40:58.317 --> 41:00.100
[chuckles]

41:03.623 --> 41:06.591
I shouldn't have played
amateur psychiatrist.

41:06.626 --> 41:09.994
- It was wrong of me.
- [whispers] It was fine.

41:11.998 --> 41:15.366
[normal voice]
I'm only watching you two

41:15.402 --> 41:18.202
because I'm afraid that
I can't catch this guy.

41:19.406 --> 41:23.241
I mean, he's been ahead of me
every step of the way.

41:23.276 --> 41:26.411
[voice breaks] What if I'm just
not good enough to catch him?

41:33.420 --> 41:35.853
But what if you are?
