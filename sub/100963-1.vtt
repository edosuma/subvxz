00:18.360 --> 00:22.096
Best thing in life is
taking what's not yours

00:22.098 --> 00:23.365
and getting away with it,

00:24.499 --> 00:25.968
and getting a good
night's sleep.

00:28.303 --> 00:29.138
Show time.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.234
Kiss my ass, Bishop.

03:02.859 --> 03:05.226
You boys gonna miss
me while I'm gone?

03:05.228 --> 03:07.228
Kiss my ass, Bishop.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.996
Potty mouth.

03:08.998 --> 03:10.965
Don't forget to tell your
wife I said hi, will ya?

03:10.967 --> 03:13.069
Yeah, screw you Bishop.

03:30.619 --> 03:33.055
He's gonna be back in a week.

04:16.699 --> 04:19.132
Give your little
brother a hug!

04:24.106 --> 04:27.374
Oh, why?

04:27.376 --> 04:28.844
Making me drive out here.

04:30.913 --> 04:32.578
Besides, you're up to no good.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.083
Missed you too.

04:38.453 --> 04:40.387
Put your shit in the trunk.

04:40.389 --> 04:42.156
Sure thing, chauffeur.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.524
Don't start, it's
a long car ride.

04:44.526 --> 04:46.026
It sure is.

04:46.028 --> 04:47.462
How'd you get the limp?

04:49.165 --> 04:51.732
Another inmate stabbed
me in the hamstring.

04:51.734 --> 04:52.933
I'm sure he had a good reason.

04:52.935 --> 04:53.769
Meh.

05:01.777 --> 05:02.710
Quit monkeying with your hair

05:02.712 --> 05:04.947
and put your belt on, jackass.

05:17.659 --> 05:19.026
You're starting
to look like Dad.

05:19.028 --> 05:22.264
Ha, just couldn't
resist could you, Danny?

05:23.699 --> 05:25.665
Well I saw your
grays coming in.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.901
Are you dying your hair?

05:27.903 --> 05:28.802
You're dying your hair!

05:28.804 --> 05:30.006
Shut up.

05:33.009 --> 05:33.843
Okay.

05:39.448 --> 05:40.914
All right, you know what, no.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.617
When are you gonna
grow up, Danny?

05:46.822 --> 05:49.725
Aiming for late
40s, early 50s, Dad.

05:52.161 --> 05:53.526
Dad, huh?

05:58.434 --> 05:59.233
Am I sounding like Dad now, huh?

05:59.235 --> 06:00.568
Watch the road!

06:02.905 --> 06:03.739
God.

06:06.175 --> 06:07.009
Oh.

06:13.115 --> 06:14.316
You visit Mom and Dad?

06:15.550 --> 06:16.385
Yeah.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.622
Did you put
tulips on the grave?

06:21.824 --> 06:23.893
Yeah.

06:24.827 --> 06:25.660
Good.

06:30.199 --> 06:32.868
Can we stop by the liquor store?

06:34.003 --> 06:36.437
Whoo doggie, it
just starts right up.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.738
I hope to God that
you're kidding.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.307
I just got out,
I just wanna drink.

06:40.309 --> 06:43.677
Yeah, just
fresh outta the joint,

06:43.679 --> 06:45.779
let's go to the liq.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.014
Tell you what, I'm gonna

06:47.016 --> 06:48.784
lay some ground
rules, butt hole.

06:49.718 --> 06:51.987
Number one, no pool halls.

06:53.889 --> 06:56.025
Number two, no women.

06:57.393 --> 06:58.992
Don't be bringing any of
your dirty little tarts

06:58.994 --> 07:00.096
over to the house.

07:01.596 --> 07:03.099
Number three, no booze.

07:06.202 --> 07:08.902
Four, five and six, no cards.

07:08.904 --> 07:11.273
No cards, no nothing.

07:14.276 --> 07:16.743
Good to be home.

07:16.745 --> 07:18.013
Yeah, welcome
back, Mr. Kotter.

07:35.764 --> 07:36.599
Danny!

07:40.503 --> 07:42.071
Danny, it's 11 a.m.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.608
Get outta bed already.

07:48.577 --> 07:51.213
Come on, you can
box the clown later.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.883
I'm goin' to work.

07:56.886 --> 07:58.118
Cute.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.354
Can you watch Lisa
while I'm gone?

08:01.290 --> 08:02.124
Danny.

08:03.325 --> 08:04.160
Danny?

08:05.561 --> 08:06.393
Danny!

08:06.395 --> 08:08.164
Yes, god!

08:09.598 --> 08:13.068
Good, when I get back
you should look for a job.

08:14.303 --> 08:16.203
Okay, Dad.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.005
Smart ass.

08:18.007 --> 08:21.777
And Danny, stay out
of the pool halls.

08:25.181 --> 08:26.315
Sure thing, Dad.

08:27.483 --> 08:28.717
Piece of shit.

08:40.129 --> 08:41.662
Morning.

08:41.664 --> 08:42.929
Good morning.

08:42.932 --> 08:45.599
I've taken the liberty
of making us coffee.

08:45.601 --> 08:48.235
French-press, if
you would like some.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.071
Yeah, sure.

08:51.307 --> 08:53.106
No smoking in the house!

08:53.108 --> 08:55.311
There's a porch outside
where you can smoke.

08:56.979 --> 08:57.813
Right.

08:59.014 --> 09:01.848
Shouldn't you be in school?

09:01.850 --> 09:03.519
It's Saturday, Danny.

09:04.653 --> 09:07.321
Sorry, I'm still
adjusting to society.

09:07.323 --> 09:10.023
I know, Dad told me
to keep an eye on you

09:10.025 --> 09:10.924
while he was gone.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.327
Hm, he did did he?

09:13.329 --> 09:14.895
What else did he say?

09:14.897 --> 09:16.830
Your mouth gets
you into trouble.

09:16.832 --> 09:19.633
That you usually have an
excuse for everything.

09:19.635 --> 09:20.836
How'd you get the limp?

09:24.440 --> 09:26.542
Bookies took a
hammer to my kneecap.

09:30.045 --> 09:31.878
Is there anything
to cook around here?

09:31.880 --> 09:33.547
You don't know how to cook.

09:33.549 --> 09:35.515
I know how to cook.

09:35.517 --> 09:37.851
You want pancakes, I'll
make some pancakes.

09:37.853 --> 09:39.286
There aren't any eggs.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.021
You want eggs and pancakes?

09:41.023 --> 09:43.859
No, you need eggs to
make pancakes, Danny.

09:47.496 --> 09:49.963
Okay, is there any
cereal to eat around here?

09:49.965 --> 09:51.701
There's some Trix
in the kitchen.

09:53.369 --> 09:56.805
Fine, fake processed
food to start my day.

10:02.278 --> 10:03.977
How long were you in jail for?

10:03.979 --> 10:06.880
Three glorious years.

10:06.882 --> 10:08.083
What did you do wrong?

10:09.852 --> 10:12.919
Well, I got caught.

10:12.921 --> 10:14.691
What law did you break?

10:16.225 --> 10:20.029
Well, I was like a
modern-day Robin Hood.

10:26.302 --> 10:30.170
Except I didn't give the
money back to the poor people.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.607
Danny, cut the crap.

10:33.809 --> 10:35.311
Okay, okay, okay.

10:38.614 --> 10:42.182
First, I hot-wired a
red-hot muscle car.

10:42.184 --> 10:46.088
Mm, then I took a gorgeous
blonde as my hostage.

10:47.256 --> 10:48.758
Got in a shoot-out
with the cops.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.728
Turns out that
gorgeous blonde though?

10:54.129 --> 10:55.364
She's an undercover cop.

10:56.932 --> 11:00.300
Put a gun to my head, said,
"Darling, you're going down."

11:00.302 --> 11:02.035
Dad said you
robbed a gas station

11:02.037 --> 11:04.037
and left the gas
hose in your gas tank

11:04.039 --> 11:05.572
as you took off.

11:05.574 --> 11:07.811
You sold your car and the
police caught you on foot.

11:09.779 --> 11:11.280
Well I like my story better.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.451
Oh you remind me of your mother.

11:17.453 --> 11:18.487
You knew my mother?

11:20.790 --> 11:22.456
Oh, I knew your mother.

11:22.458 --> 11:23.992
I knew her before your dad did.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.961
What was she like?

11:28.765 --> 11:33.770
Well, she was a tornado
of beauty and hell.

11:34.636 --> 11:35.839
She was certainly a life force.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.141
She was pretty though, right?

11:40.442 --> 11:41.274
Yeah, she was pretty.

11:41.276 --> 11:45.180
She was a lot like you.

11:46.850 --> 11:49.784
But do me a favor,
don't tell your dad

11:49.786 --> 11:51.318
we talked about
your mother, okay?

11:51.320 --> 11:53.555
Don't worry, I
won't say anything.

12:00.797 --> 12:03.765
Do you know about the
secret Bishop talent?

12:03.767 --> 12:04.699
No.

12:04.701 --> 12:06.166
Oh that's too bad.

12:06.168 --> 12:07.434
Why is that?

12:07.436 --> 12:09.269
Oh, just
for a few reasons.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.604
What reasons?

12:10.606 --> 12:12.973
Well, every adult should know

12:12.975 --> 12:14.709
this rare and unique talent.

12:14.711 --> 12:15.976
What's so unique about it?

12:15.978 --> 12:17.577
Oh, I don't
know if you're ready.

12:17.579 --> 12:19.346
It is very special.

12:19.348 --> 12:20.817
How do I know if I'm ready?

12:22.117 --> 12:26.319
Well, seven pancakes.

12:26.321 --> 12:30.792
So, if I make seven pancakes,
I'll know if I'm ready?

12:30.794 --> 12:31.627
Bingo.

12:32.528 --> 12:33.795
You're lucky I hid some eggs

12:33.797 --> 12:35.429
in the back of the freezer.

12:35.431 --> 12:36.265
Mm.

12:46.876 --> 12:48.074
Seven pancakes.

12:48.076 --> 12:49.576
Seven pancakes.

12:49.578 --> 12:51.712
So?

12:51.714 --> 12:54.514
So, you wanna play poker?

12:54.516 --> 12:55.317
No.

12:56.351 --> 12:57.352
Of course not.

12:58.620 --> 13:01.054
Most important thing
to know about poker

13:01.056 --> 13:02.622
is it's not gambling.

13:02.624 --> 13:03.957
It's deception.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.561
Who taught you all of this?

13:06.729 --> 13:08.962
A special friend you
might meet one day.

13:08.964 --> 13:09.866
Well teach me!

13:11.233 --> 13:13.937
Lisa, let me eat my pancakes
first, please thank you.

13:14.904 --> 13:15.839
Fine.

13:23.378 --> 13:25.378
Now, if I have a
flush and you have

13:25.380 --> 13:26.613
a straight, who wins?

13:26.615 --> 13:27.849
You.

13:27.851 --> 13:29.951
Very good, and what
is the highest hand?

13:29.953 --> 13:31.051
Royal flush.

13:31.053 --> 13:32.187
Also very good.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.790
Speaking of royal,
there is mail for you

13:35.792 --> 13:38.193
from the Queen, whoever that is.

13:39.561 --> 13:40.862
When did it arrive?

13:40.864 --> 13:42.998
Yesterday, it's in this stack.

13:51.607 --> 13:53.273
My dearest Daniel.

13:53.275 --> 13:55.175
Oh, how I've missed you.

13:55.177 --> 13:56.476
Welcome home.

13:56.478 --> 13:58.178
Time flies by when
you've got my boys

13:58.180 --> 14:01.081
protecting you in
prison, doesn't it?

14:01.083 --> 14:02.616
I'm sure you're
reading this letter

14:02.618 --> 14:04.119
wondering why I sent it.

14:05.454 --> 14:07.454
Well Daniel, you're
too good at what you do

14:07.456 --> 14:09.757
and I want you back.

14:09.759 --> 14:11.324
I've been patiently
waiting for you

14:11.326 --> 14:14.094
to come home and
play in my sandbox.

14:14.096 --> 14:18.064
Not to mention, we've
got unfinished business.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.635
Oh, now be a good boy

14:21.637 --> 14:23.838
and come visit me tonight.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.039
Don't make me come
find you, Daniel.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.609
A lady never likes to wait.

14:28.745 --> 14:30.112
You're truly mine, Alex.

14:34.349 --> 14:35.183
What's wrong?

14:38.755 --> 14:39.588
Nothing.

14:42.324 --> 14:43.758
When does your dad get back?

14:43.760 --> 14:45.425
Tonight.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.761
Good.

14:46.763 --> 14:48.863
You still wanna play poker?

14:48.865 --> 14:50.767
No, you've learned
enough for today.

14:51.968 --> 14:53.667
I need to go, are
you gonna be okay?

14:53.669 --> 14:54.902
You must be joking.

14:54.904 --> 14:57.437
Of course, we have
HBO Go and I need to

14:57.439 --> 15:00.607
get caught up with "Real
Time with Bill Maher."

15:00.609 --> 15:01.976
What the hell is HBO Go?

15:01.978 --> 15:04.144
A network streaming
platform, Danny.

15:04.146 --> 15:05.579
Get with it.

15:05.581 --> 15:07.982
Right, whatever.

15:07.984 --> 15:09.784
Oh, and don't you don't
tell your Dad any...

15:09.786 --> 15:12.087
Relax, I won't say
anything about poker.

15:13.355 --> 15:14.254
How did you know I was...

15:14.256 --> 15:15.424
Danny, I got it.

15:17.326 --> 15:18.160
Right.

15:24.499 --> 15:25.432
She's so nice.

15:25.434 --> 15:27.534
I've talked to her before.

15:28.805 --> 15:30.570
Come on, we can get
you the best tuxedo.

15:30.572 --> 15:31.772
You're gonna look amazing.

15:31.774 --> 15:34.041
Okay, it's to the right.

15:34.043 --> 15:35.609
This is
a outfit.

15:35.611 --> 15:38.614
Come on.

15:51.861 --> 15:55.865
How 'bout this?

16:03.238 --> 16:04.839
When you were my
age, did you think

16:04.841 --> 16:06.841
you would be where you are now?

16:06.843 --> 16:08.341
No.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.543
Why don't people just
let other people be happy?

16:10.545 --> 16:13.413
What do you mean?

16:13.415 --> 16:15.548
Louis's family has a
sign in their front yard

16:15.550 --> 16:18.318
that says, "One man, one woman."

16:18.320 --> 16:19.820
What does it matter to them?

16:19.822 --> 16:21.989
Well, do you want
the simple answer

16:21.991 --> 16:23.523
or the brutal answer?

16:23.525 --> 16:24.359
Both.

16:25.728 --> 16:28.763
Well, they have a
self-centered, simplistic

16:28.765 --> 16:31.231
ideology, they have
a very crude view

16:31.233 --> 16:33.067
that's black or
white because it's

16:33.069 --> 16:34.269
easier to differentiate.

16:35.404 --> 16:37.071
Cognitively, they can't
understand being gay

16:37.073 --> 16:39.040
because they
themselves aren't gay.

16:39.042 --> 16:41.508
Therefore, being
gay is different

16:41.510 --> 16:43.178
resulting in that being wrong.

16:44.346 --> 16:46.513
From an intellectual
standpoint, they lack

16:46.515 --> 16:47.782
the ability to
understand that we live

16:47.784 --> 16:50.252
in a colorful world, not
a black or white one.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.087
What's the brutal answer?

16:53.089 --> 16:54.057
They're assholes.

16:55.323 --> 16:57.160
I see, sounds about right.

16:58.427 --> 16:59.960
I inherited a small
plumbing business

16:59.962 --> 17:01.696
from your grandfather.

17:01.698 --> 17:03.798
I don't make a lot of money.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.400
I enjoy working in this country,

17:06.736 --> 17:08.969
and I cherish the diversity
that I'm a part of.

17:08.971 --> 17:11.907
If I can teach you anything,
it'd be to do the same.

17:13.142 --> 17:14.842
Sometimes Louis
makes fun of Shawn

17:14.844 --> 17:17.544
at the bus stop because
he has two moms.

17:17.546 --> 17:19.012
He says he won't be
a real man because

17:19.015 --> 17:21.282
he doesn't have a father
to play sports with.

17:22.451 --> 17:23.751
Did Shawn tell
your teacher this?

17:23.752 --> 17:24.952
No.

17:24.954 --> 17:27.088
I think he's embarrassed.

17:27.089 --> 17:27.924
Poor kid.

17:29.092 --> 17:31.391
Well Louis is probably
like that because

17:31.393 --> 17:32.693
his father used to
do the same thing

17:32.695 --> 17:34.529
to Danny and I when
we were your age.

17:36.099 --> 17:38.498
I tell you what, next
time Louis does that,

17:38.500 --> 17:40.400
I want you to pick up a rock,

17:40.402 --> 17:41.367
and smash it in his face.

17:41.369 --> 17:43.603
You want me to assault him?

17:43.605 --> 17:47.110
No, on second thought, I
can't afford the insurance.

17:48.543 --> 17:50.510
Just kick him in the balls.

17:50.512 --> 17:52.012
Bishops stand up
for what's right.

17:52.014 --> 17:52.882
Always.

18:06.796 --> 18:07.697
Come in.

18:11.399 --> 18:14.771
Oh, Daniel, I've
been expecting you.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.671
Take a seat.

18:19.508 --> 18:21.244
Do you have any
pet fish, Daniel?

18:24.247 --> 18:26.682
I avoided ownership
after seeing "Free Willy."

18:27.817 --> 18:29.282
I see.

18:29.284 --> 18:32.720
My sister and I, we had
many and always betta fish.

18:32.722 --> 18:33.790
Are you familiar?

18:35.390 --> 18:38.726
Yes, also known as
Siamese fighting fish.

18:38.728 --> 18:42.765
Ah, there's that
flash of genius.

18:44.299 --> 18:46.633
See me and my sister,
we'd take the two males

18:46.635 --> 18:48.035
and we'd put 'em in
the bowl together

18:48.037 --> 18:49.671
and watch 'em
fight to the death.

18:51.174 --> 18:52.708
We didn't have a TV growing up.

18:55.011 --> 18:57.512
There can never be two bettas.

18:59.314 --> 19:03.150
As a child, I never
truly comprehended that

19:03.152 --> 19:08.157
until I
killed my sister.

19:13.029 --> 19:16.065
See, we were in love
with the same girl.

19:18.801 --> 19:22.337
It was an odd feeling
when I realized

19:23.405 --> 19:24.839
I was the betta.

19:24.841 --> 19:26.807
And that's when I
took over my entire

19:26.809 --> 19:29.578
neighborhood, and then
alternately the city.

19:37.253 --> 19:40.723
It's always been my destiny
to rule this city, Daniel.

19:44.459 --> 19:49.464
Daniel, you're a
good poker player.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.400
But you never know when to quit.

19:53.535 --> 19:55.368
And you're an even
better con man

19:55.370 --> 19:57.039
but you never wanna quit.

19:58.241 --> 20:01.677
You owe me
too much money, Daniel.

20:03.913 --> 20:06.646
What am I gonna do with you?

20:06.648 --> 20:08.983
Well, you could
start by sending me

20:08.985 --> 20:10.684
to bed without dinner.

20:10.686 --> 20:12.052
Or you know what, you could even

20:12.054 --> 20:14.156
pull down my pants and
give me a spanking.

20:16.692 --> 20:19.362
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

20:21.563 --> 20:25.032
Your mouth is always getting
you into trouble, Daniel.

20:25.034 --> 20:29.003
However, your mouth isn't
the problem, Daniel.

20:29.005 --> 20:30.436
- Do you know what it is?
- Danny!

20:30.438 --> 20:32.574
My name is Danny, not Daniel.

20:35.510 --> 20:40.415
Daniel, do you know
what the problem is?

20:42.151 --> 20:43.117
Enlighten me.

20:47.555 --> 20:49.256
Yes, Violet?

20:49.258 --> 20:51.058
I'm going shopping.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.659
And?

20:52.661 --> 20:53.396
Plastic?

20:54.562 --> 20:56.564
Visa's on the nightstand.

20:57.833 --> 20:58.734
Visa?

20:59.735 --> 21:01.302
I don't want the Visa.

21:01.304 --> 21:03.938
Can I have a black card?

21:03.940 --> 21:04.941
Come here.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.079
Ah, ah, ah.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.386
Love you.

21:18.553 --> 21:20.323
Oh, I see you got
the gift I got you.

21:21.190 --> 21:22.024
I did.

21:30.933 --> 21:33.834
When you gonna grow up, Daniel?

21:33.836 --> 21:35.371
Stop acting like a child?

21:36.504 --> 21:39.840
Finally mature,
take responsibility

21:39.842 --> 21:42.142
for your own life?

21:42.144 --> 21:43.611
Quit with all the shenanigans?

21:48.384 --> 21:51.187
You're very
inspirational, Alex.

21:53.356 --> 21:55.521
Your smart ass
jokes are funny.

21:55.523 --> 21:56.826
I'm not denying that.

21:57.927 --> 22:00.127
See, you made me a lot of money

22:00.129 --> 22:01.627
with all that charm.

22:01.629 --> 22:06.634
Mm, time marches on, the
days get long, Daniel.

22:09.905 --> 22:12.638
And you still owe me a debt.

22:13.843 --> 22:15.376
No?

22:15.378 --> 22:20.214
So if you don't give me my
fucking money in 72 hours,

22:20.216 --> 22:21.982
I'm gonna take that
little niece of yours

22:21.984 --> 22:23.183
and I'm gonna put
her in a barrel

22:23.185 --> 22:25.152
of fucking acid
and make you watch.

22:25.154 --> 22:27.988
And I think you know
who she reminds you of,

22:27.990 --> 22:29.058
don't you?

22:29.925 --> 22:31.492
How many days is that, Daniel?

22:31.494 --> 22:32.960
- Three!
- How many days?

22:32.962 --> 22:33.796
Three!

22:35.431 --> 22:37.364
One more time.

22:37.366 --> 22:38.200
Three.

22:42.171 --> 22:44.006
Oh good boy, Daniel.

23:03.159 --> 23:05.428
That's enough
reading for today.

23:08.264 --> 23:09.396
Did you have a
good day, or what?

23:09.398 --> 23:10.230
Yep.

23:10.232 --> 23:11.899
Yeah?

23:11.901 --> 23:12.833
Get some sleep, Sweetheart.

23:12.835 --> 23:14.268
I'll see you in the morning.

23:14.270 --> 23:16.038
But Dad, can I
ask you something?

23:19.175 --> 23:20.841
Of course.

23:20.843 --> 23:21.775
Any new girls?

23:21.777 --> 23:23.844
Ha, Jesus.

23:23.846 --> 23:26.313
Did we not just have this
conversation yesterday?

23:26.315 --> 23:27.147
No.

23:27.149 --> 23:27.981
Why not?

23:27.983 --> 23:29.983
I don't know.

23:29.985 --> 23:31.752
Mom passed away
a long time ago.

23:31.754 --> 23:33.821
You need to put
yourself out there.

23:33.823 --> 23:36.258
Take some ownership
and ask a girl out.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.093
I'm working on it, Sweetheart.

23:39.095 --> 23:41.895
Well, I'm
not seeing results.

23:41.897 --> 23:43.430
I can't believe we're having
this conversation again.

23:43.432 --> 23:46.233
Maybe you should
try a dating website.

23:46.235 --> 23:47.901
Little Jimmy Taylor's
dad found a wife

23:47.903 --> 23:50.003
on Christian Mingle.

23:50.005 --> 23:52.005
Paul Taylor found a wife?

23:52.007 --> 23:54.675
That's the word at
the bus stop today.

23:54.677 --> 23:55.678
Ah, shit.

23:57.612 --> 23:58.914
I do need to get out there.

24:01.150 --> 24:03.817
Look, thank you for
the information.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.421
Get some sleep, Sweetheart.

24:08.724 --> 24:10.757
Don't forget to
brush your teeth.

24:10.759 --> 24:13.393
Yes, I
know, goodnight.

24:13.395 --> 24:14.230
Goodnight.

24:43.392 --> 24:44.324
You're late.

24:44.326 --> 24:45.161
Sorry.

24:46.495 --> 24:47.496
How bad?

24:48.531 --> 24:49.365
Bad.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.399
How
much do you need?

24:52.401 --> 24:53.235
100 K.

24:54.203 --> 24:55.269
Jesus, Danny.

24:55.271 --> 24:56.272
You asked!

24:57.173 --> 24:59.106
Danny, Danny, Danny.

24:59.108 --> 25:01.041
What am I gonna do with you?

25:01.043 --> 25:02.776
Well Merchant,
Merchant, Merchant.

25:02.778 --> 25:07.014
Daniel, don't mock me,
you little smart ass.

25:07.016 --> 25:08.951
Sorry, old habits
die hard, you know.

25:10.319 --> 25:11.687
Recite the rules, Daniel.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.087
Merchant, I'm not 17 anymore.

25:14.089 --> 25:15.491
The rules, Daniel.

25:17.893 --> 25:18.694
Fine.

25:20.129 --> 25:23.332
Rule number one, know the
beginning before the ending.

25:24.433 --> 25:25.832
Rule number two,
there's no such thing

25:25.834 --> 25:28.302
as gambling, only deception.

25:28.304 --> 25:30.804
Rule number three,
the true art of a con

25:30.806 --> 25:32.372
is creating the
illusion you're behind

25:32.374 --> 25:34.308
when you're really ahead.

25:34.310 --> 25:38.345
Number four, there's no
such thing as bad luck,

25:38.347 --> 25:39.648
only bad people.

25:40.849 --> 25:44.184
Rule number five,
I live for myself

25:44.186 --> 25:46.088
and I answer to no one.

25:48.157 --> 25:50.726
Five rules you executed
all too well, I'm afraid.

25:51.727 --> 25:53.329
You sound like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

25:55.297 --> 25:56.997
When are you gonna grow up?

25:56.999 --> 25:57.833
God.

25:58.968 --> 25:59.969
You know, Daniel?

26:00.936 --> 26:03.170
You shoulda been a prima donna.

26:03.172 --> 26:04.740
But instead you were a prodigy.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.909
I taught you
everything you know.

26:08.911 --> 26:10.744
I found you when you
were just a bus boy

26:10.746 --> 26:12.716
in that dumpy casino,
going nowhere.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.482
I taught you how to play poker.

26:15.484 --> 26:17.386
I taught you how to con.

26:18.787 --> 26:21.355
You were the greatest
student I ever had.

26:21.357 --> 26:23.859
I've never seen anybody
with as much skill as you.

26:27.196 --> 26:29.398
I know your family must
have been hell, but.

26:30.866 --> 26:33.068
And I may have been the only
parent figure you ever had.

26:34.236 --> 26:36.972
But it's time for
you to give this up.

26:42.511 --> 26:44.113
So what are you trying to say?

26:47.116 --> 26:49.182
You need to pull
off one more con.

26:49.184 --> 26:51.652
One more big round
at the poker table.

26:51.654 --> 26:53.455
Settle this debt
you have with Alex.

26:55.224 --> 26:57.226
I'll front you the
100 K to pull it off.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.095
- But...
- But what?

27:02.831 --> 27:05.634
Once you win,
and you will win,

27:09.071 --> 27:12.742
you'll leave and you stay
gone from the city forever.

27:13.809 --> 27:15.377
Arthur and Lisa don't need you.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.645
You're only gonna get them hurt.

27:18.647 --> 27:20.949
They can't afford to be
put in danger anymore.

27:23.787 --> 27:24.788
Those are the terms.

27:29.358 --> 27:31.360
You watch over
them while I'm gone?

27:32.361 --> 27:33.195
Of course!

27:35.097 --> 27:37.197
After all, Lisa is
my granddaughter.

27:37.199 --> 27:38.434
It's the least I can do.

27:43.707 --> 27:45.707
You know, Alex is
gonna come after you

27:45.709 --> 27:47.274
if she finds out.

27:47.276 --> 27:48.110
Relax.

27:50.579 --> 27:51.779
I'm the merchant of the city.

27:55.517 --> 27:56.686
I'll be fine.

28:06.161 --> 28:06.995
So that's it.

28:10.165 --> 28:11.166
That's it.

28:18.842 --> 28:19.676
Danny.

28:27.049 --> 28:27.883
Good luck.

29:11.260 --> 29:12.860
Fucked up, huh?

29:12.862 --> 29:14.729
Get over here.

29:14.731 --> 29:17.030
Fucking did this to yourself.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.933
Get in there.

29:22.772 --> 29:23.939
You hear that?

29:25.107 --> 29:27.742
That's the sound of my
bank account going down.

29:27.744 --> 29:29.811
Not a pleasant sound, is it?

29:29.813 --> 29:32.279
Get in there.

29:32.281 --> 29:33.447
Excuse me, Sir.

29:33.449 --> 29:36.249
Loaned you too
much, too many times.

29:36.251 --> 29:37.083
Excuse me, Sir.

29:37.085 --> 29:37.921
What?

29:38.822 --> 29:40.755
Henry's on the phone.

29:40.757 --> 29:42.824
Oh, he is?

29:42.826 --> 29:44.124
Yes.

29:44.126 --> 29:46.493
And Danny Bishop
just got outta jail.

29:46.495 --> 29:49.565
Ah, the plot thickens.

29:50.466 --> 29:52.199
What should we do with him?

29:52.201 --> 29:54.369
What do we do to
people who don't pay me?

29:55.304 --> 29:56.503
Mississippi?

29:56.505 --> 29:58.240
That's right.

30:00.142 --> 30:01.676
Mississippi.

30:27.436 --> 30:28.268
I thought you said
you never wanted

30:28.270 --> 30:30.337
to talk to me again.

30:30.339 --> 30:32.007
I can hang up if you want.

30:33.442 --> 30:36.178
I'm glad you called,
just please, don't.

30:38.347 --> 30:39.515
So I've been thinking.

30:41.183 --> 30:43.951
Have you given thought
to what I said?

30:43.953 --> 30:46.854
Henry, I can change.

30:46.856 --> 30:49.057
It just, it just takes time.

30:50.025 --> 30:52.528
How long as it
been, two years?

30:58.333 --> 31:00.302
Where were you just now?

31:01.503 --> 31:04.404
Just here at the
club, making a drink.

31:04.406 --> 31:06.406
You're lying.

31:06.408 --> 31:08.642
I can always tell
when you're lying.

31:08.644 --> 31:10.112
That's because you love me.

31:15.018 --> 31:16.483
Loan shark.

31:16.485 --> 31:18.688
Does that mean
you're coming back?

31:20.222 --> 31:21.056
I don't know.

31:23.693 --> 31:24.593
I need more time.

31:26.029 --> 31:27.260
I have to go.

31:27.262 --> 31:29.062
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:29.064 --> 31:33.266
Tell me, is there someone else?

31:33.268 --> 31:35.535
No.

31:35.537 --> 31:36.369
Promise.

31:36.371 --> 31:38.271
I'm gonna hang up now.

31:38.273 --> 31:39.306
Don't get mad and
throw the phone

31:39.308 --> 31:40.607
across the room, okay?

31:40.609 --> 31:42.879
I won't, I'm a changed man.

31:46.148 --> 31:46.950
Goodbye.

32:04.801 --> 32:05.634
Bishop is here.

32:07.904 --> 32:08.972
Of course he is.

32:10.039 --> 32:12.773
I sense a disturbance
in the force.

32:12.775 --> 32:14.641
I'm sorry, Sir,
I don't follow.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.610
It's a "Stars Wars" reference.

32:16.612 --> 32:17.812
Sorry, Sir, I've
never seen "Star Wars."

32:17.814 --> 32:22.215
Never mind, just
give me a few minutes

32:22.217 --> 32:23.851
and send him in.

32:23.853 --> 32:24.687
Yes, Sir.

32:53.016 --> 32:54.581
You hear this?

32:54.583 --> 32:55.515
The music?

32:55.517 --> 32:57.384
Yes.

32:57.386 --> 32:58.652
Yes, I can hear the music.

32:58.654 --> 33:00.389
Jazz music's my favorite.

33:01.657 --> 33:02.990
With jazz music you can wake up

33:02.992 --> 33:05.394
with a hangover and
still enjoy the day.

33:07.096 --> 33:08.965
You know what else
I like about jazz?

33:10.565 --> 33:12.133
The tone?

33:12.135 --> 33:14.302
I never know how
it's going to start,

33:15.637 --> 33:18.605
but I do know how
it's going to end.

33:18.607 --> 33:23.077
However, with you,
Daniel Bishop, I never

33:23.079 --> 33:27.083
know when it starts, but I do
know how it's going to end.

33:30.687 --> 33:32.185
Bad.

33:32.187 --> 33:34.623
Danny, my name is
Danny, not Daniel.

33:37.026 --> 33:38.527
You only live once, Danny.

33:40.629 --> 33:43.196
Yes, well listen,
Jazz Boss, I pulled off

33:43.198 --> 33:46.266
a very big con for
you in the past,

33:46.268 --> 33:48.135
and I'd like to
think I've developed

33:48.137 --> 33:50.670
a very good line
of credit with you.

33:50.672 --> 33:54.474
Yes, a quarter of
a million dollars

33:54.476 --> 33:56.179
made off of a real estate con.

33:57.446 --> 33:59.614
Perhaps you've had too
much success, Daniel.

34:00.817 --> 34:02.083
People put their
money down on you

34:02.085 --> 34:04.317
and you crumble
under the pressure.

34:04.319 --> 34:06.856
You ran away,
to prison.

34:07.757 --> 34:09.357
I know you wanted to get caught.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.460
Took the easy way out.

34:14.262 --> 34:17.063
Yep, well as much
as I enjoy your

34:17.065 --> 34:18.933
rousing pep talk, Tony Robbins,

34:18.935 --> 34:20.266
if you're not going to help me

34:20.268 --> 34:22.705
then I will find
someone who will.

34:23.973 --> 34:28.440
I'm a loan shark,
Danny, not a bad guy.

34:28.443 --> 34:33.179
Ah, she gave you the betta
fish speech, didn't she?

34:33.181 --> 34:34.614
Yes, she did.

34:34.616 --> 34:38.853
Jesus, Danny, she'll destroy
your entire family tree.

34:38.855 --> 34:40.087
I'm well aware.

34:40.089 --> 34:41.822
There's only one thing
that God and the devil

34:41.824 --> 34:43.523
have in common.

34:43.525 --> 34:44.960
They fear Alex.

34:46.062 --> 34:47.862
Yes, I know.

34:47.864 --> 34:50.630
So, who else have you gone to?

34:50.632 --> 34:51.466
The usual.

34:53.202 --> 34:55.335
I heard you went
to the Merchant.

34:55.337 --> 34:56.871
How much did he give you?

34:56.873 --> 34:59.175
Hm, not enough.

35:00.342 --> 35:01.675
How the hell did you
know that anyway?

35:01.677 --> 35:04.080
Word travels fast
in the city, Danny.

35:05.214 --> 35:06.481
How much do you need?

35:07.717 --> 35:09.049
100.

35:09.051 --> 35:13.220
Hm, I'll front you the
money, with interest.

35:13.222 --> 35:14.056
Thank you.

35:15.691 --> 35:18.225
A very large interest, Danny.

35:18.227 --> 35:20.462
I wasn't expecting
anything less.

35:21.630 --> 35:23.598
Under one condition.

35:27.003 --> 35:27.804
Yes?

35:28.938 --> 35:31.741
I wanna dance
with your fine ass.

35:36.611 --> 35:37.546
What, no.

35:40.382 --> 35:44.218
Look, I'm not twerking on
you, or grinding on you,

35:44.220 --> 35:46.220
or whatever the hell
they call it nowadays.

35:46.222 --> 35:49.389
Oh shut up, I
just want a normal slow dance.

35:49.391 --> 35:50.390
One dance?

35:50.392 --> 35:51.391
One dance.

35:51.393 --> 35:52.625
And then I get my money?

35:52.627 --> 35:54.230
You
get your 100 K.

35:55.131 --> 35:55.965
Shit, fine.

36:00.903 --> 36:02.171
Mm-hmm, yeah.

36:03.538 --> 36:04.839
Lucky I got a drink in me.

36:04.841 --> 36:09.477
Oh, that's fine.

36:12.614 --> 36:14.647
Oh my god, really?

36:14.649 --> 36:15.818
I knew you'd like it.

36:18.587 --> 36:21.354
Odds are against you
this time around, Danny.

36:21.356 --> 36:23.791
Well I never knew
you were on my side.

36:23.793 --> 36:25.192
This is going
to be the biggest

36:25.194 --> 36:26.593
poker match of your life,

36:26.595 --> 36:30.231
and you won't even make
a penny, win or lose.

36:30.233 --> 36:31.932
Yes, well it's the
simple things in life

36:31.934 --> 36:34.068
that keep us humble,
so I'll gladly

36:34.070 --> 36:36.569
accept a moral victory.

36:36.571 --> 36:41.008
Well, at least you haven't
lost your smart ass abilities.

36:41.010 --> 36:44.111
Indeed, so I heard Henry left.

36:44.113 --> 36:46.013
How are you holding up?

36:46.015 --> 36:47.480
How the hell
did you know that?

36:47.482 --> 36:49.651
Word travels fast in the city.

36:51.220 --> 36:52.853
Of course.

36:52.855 --> 36:55.723
Well, you know me,
Danny, being a criminal

36:55.725 --> 36:58.393
comes so natural, it's
difficult to depart.

37:00.096 --> 37:01.328
Yeah, I can relate.

37:01.330 --> 37:04.164
Mm, I wish I was
as good as you.

37:04.166 --> 37:05.134
Everyone does.

37:06.235 --> 37:08.401
Too bad you're a bad dancer.

37:08.403 --> 37:11.005
I'm rusty, thank
you very much.

37:11.007 --> 37:13.640
Well, I appreciate
the dance, Danny,

37:13.642 --> 37:16.509
but that's all the time I have.

37:16.511 --> 37:19.914
You know me, crimes are
committed, people are beat.

37:19.916 --> 37:20.816
Imagine that.

37:21.951 --> 37:24.486
By the way, how did
you get that limp?

37:26.022 --> 37:27.054
Sky diving incident.

37:27.056 --> 37:29.491
Ah, of course.

37:31.928 --> 37:33.930
The money will be
wired to you tomorrow.

37:35.398 --> 37:36.232
Thank you.

37:37.432 --> 37:40.600
Take care of
yourself, Jazz Boss.

37:40.602 --> 37:42.937
Mm-hmm, good luck.

37:42.939 --> 37:43.940
Thank you.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.245
Hey Arthur.

38:25.247 --> 38:26.512
Get you another one?

38:26.514 --> 38:27.348
I'm good.

38:27.350 --> 38:29.352
All right.

38:30.252 --> 38:31.352
Hey you.

38:33.055 --> 38:35.122
You owe me a drink.

38:35.124 --> 38:35.958
Excuse me?

38:37.827 --> 38:40.260
I heard your brother
got outta jail.

38:40.262 --> 38:41.395
And?

38:41.397 --> 38:44.765
And I was the pool hall.

38:44.767 --> 38:46.266
Shit.

38:46.268 --> 38:48.601
This afternoon he conned
me out of all my money.

38:48.603 --> 38:50.804
Best pool player I've ever seen.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.039
He hustled me.

38:52.041 --> 38:52.875
I'm sorry.

38:53.843 --> 38:54.744
Where you goin'?

38:56.112 --> 38:57.645
Your brother's a marked man.

38:59.048 --> 39:02.118
He threw himself in prison
to escape everything.

39:03.686 --> 39:05.421
They're gonna kill your brother.

39:07.023 --> 39:09.490
Here, that's for your trouble.

39:14.130 --> 39:15.597
Somebody call this guy a cab.

39:16.465 --> 39:17.800
He's had too much to drink.

39:20.703 --> 39:22.204
Hey
man, you all right?

39:25.307 --> 39:26.509
Anything good in here?

39:29.445 --> 39:31.747
Nothing of
your taste, unfortunately.

39:33.749 --> 39:36.252
Oh, that's too bad.

39:37.686 --> 39:39.155
Yeah, that's a shame.

39:43.492 --> 39:47.127
Word around town is
Danny Bishop's back.

39:47.129 --> 39:48.497
You don't say.

39:50.332 --> 39:51.967
Have you
heard from him?

39:54.336 --> 39:55.568
Have you?

39:55.570 --> 39:58.072
He's playing in the
high rollers game.

39:58.074 --> 40:01.043
And I'm wondering who gave
him the money to enter.

40:02.711 --> 40:05.546
Well, I'm sure a
very nice, generous man

40:05.548 --> 40:07.783
gave it to him.

40:08.784 --> 40:09.985
You're probably right.

40:11.754 --> 40:15.324
You know what I'd like to
do to that generous man?

40:16.959 --> 40:19.328
I'd like to skin him alive.

40:21.864 --> 40:22.932
Taste him.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.702
Well I sure hope
you find him, Alex.

40:28.838 --> 40:30.137
I'm gonna play in
that high rollers game

40:30.139 --> 40:31.740
myself and beat Daniel.

40:34.844 --> 40:37.046
Why do you like to
see people suffer?

40:40.082 --> 40:42.518
Oh honey, I get off on it.

40:43.486 --> 40:44.854
That and my two girlfriends.

40:46.654 --> 40:48.023
You're insane.

40:49.758 --> 40:50.826
So I've been told.

40:55.297 --> 40:57.933
I sure would like to be there.

40:58.868 --> 40:59.667
For what?

41:02.338 --> 41:05.606
To see your face when
Danny drops the hammer.

41:05.608 --> 41:06.641
He's the best.

41:07.843 --> 41:09.810
And he's 10 times the
player you'll ever be.

41:09.812 --> 41:11.714
What makes you so
fucking confident?

41:14.049 --> 41:14.984
I taught him.

41:18.454 --> 41:19.654
Place looks like shit.

41:21.790 --> 41:22.791
I've been told.

41:31.333 --> 41:32.466
Been
drinking alone, huh?

41:32.468 --> 41:34.535
Oh my favorite way, Arthur.

41:34.537 --> 41:37.471
Yeah, you
sound just like Dad.

41:37.473 --> 41:38.307
Mm-hmm.

41:39.975 --> 41:40.809
What'd you do?

41:42.244 --> 41:43.577
Nothing.

41:43.579 --> 41:44.380
Danny.

41:46.015 --> 41:47.414
Promise you won't get mad?

41:47.416 --> 41:48.215
Danny!

41:48.217 --> 41:49.318
Promise?

41:50.753 --> 41:51.554
Fine.

41:53.322 --> 41:57.092
When I was in prison,
I was being protected

41:58.527 --> 42:00.394
and I owe these
people a large debt,

42:00.396 --> 42:03.297
and if I don't pay them,
they're going to kill me.

42:03.299 --> 42:05.467
Oh, and you and Lisa too.

42:09.972 --> 42:11.073
How much do you owe?

42:13.042 --> 42:15.042
Just under a million.

42:15.044 --> 42:16.076
God damn it, Danny!

42:16.078 --> 42:18.347
Would you calm down?

42:22.017 --> 42:23.317
Do you have the money?

42:23.319 --> 42:24.918
No.

42:24.920 --> 42:27.187
Do you have a way
to get the money?

42:27.189 --> 42:29.089
Of course, poker tournament.

42:29.091 --> 42:30.958
Jesus Christ, are
you outta your mind?

42:30.960 --> 42:33.126
Would you calm down, Dad?

42:33.128 --> 42:34.828
Don't call me Dad.

42:34.830 --> 42:37.397
Then quit acting like him.

42:37.399 --> 42:38.400
You need to leave.

42:40.704 --> 42:43.505
Look, I'll be able
to pay them back.

42:44.573 --> 42:45.505
I think.

42:45.507 --> 42:47.007
You enjoy ruining this family?

42:47.009 --> 42:48.542
Or is this just a game?

42:48.544 --> 42:49.876
Well, Arthur, I was the
black sheep of the family.

42:49.878 --> 42:51.511
I never did fit in, did I?

42:51.513 --> 42:53.580
Oh yeah, that's right.

42:53.582 --> 42:55.582
Bitter and sweet, just like Mom.

42:55.584 --> 42:58.018
Yep, bitter and
sweet, just like Mom.

42:58.020 --> 42:59.219
And you were the golden child.

42:59.221 --> 43:01.323
Hm, yeah.

43:04.493 --> 43:07.961
It was equal until you chose
the life that you have now.

43:07.963 --> 43:10.130
I have never asked
you for anything.

43:10.132 --> 43:13.800
Just please trust me this
one time, I am begging you.

43:13.802 --> 43:15.068
I can't.

43:15.070 --> 43:17.039
I have a daughter to protect!

43:32.621 --> 43:35.024
Your daughter, is
that right, Arthur?

43:36.191 --> 43:37.759
Hm.

43:39.928 --> 43:42.095
You stole her from me!

43:42.097 --> 43:44.933
That's 'cause
you're a criminal.

43:45.901 --> 43:46.867
Get...

43:46.869 --> 43:49.503
Enough, you two!

43:49.505 --> 43:51.405
What the hell is going on?

43:51.407 --> 43:53.273
Watch your mouth!

43:53.275 --> 43:55.177
Why are you fighting?

43:56.312 --> 43:57.611
It's adult
stuff, Sweetheart.

43:57.613 --> 43:58.812
Adult?

43:58.814 --> 44:01.683
No, children,
that's what you are.

44:01.685 --> 44:03.150
Both of you need to
realize you come from

44:03.152 --> 44:04.818
the same flesh and same blood

44:04.820 --> 44:06.920
and should rely on each other.

44:06.922 --> 44:09.124
Only then will I
consider you men.

44:10.059 --> 44:11.291
He started it.

44:11.293 --> 44:12.225
You had it coming.

44:12.227 --> 44:14.129
Enough, you two!

44:15.497 --> 44:18.365
If one of us is in trouble,
we're all in trouble.

44:18.367 --> 44:21.068
We're family, we're Bishops.

44:21.070 --> 44:22.804
We'll make it through.

44:22.806 --> 44:26.239
Arthur, treat
Danny with respect.

44:26.241 --> 44:29.144
Danny, no more drinking
under this roof.

44:30.112 --> 44:30.946
Fine.

44:36.118 --> 44:36.985
Sweetheart.

45:05.114 --> 45:08.117
Tequila on the rocks
with a lime, please.

45:09.819 --> 45:13.655
You'll have to forgive
me, but we're closed.

45:14.824 --> 45:15.991
Are you sure?

45:17.393 --> 45:19.459
I wouldn't want this place
going out of business.

45:19.461 --> 45:22.064
I so do enjoy coming here.

45:25.534 --> 45:27.200
So spoiled.

45:27.202 --> 45:28.003
I know.

45:33.976 --> 45:36.443
I see you brought a date.

45:36.445 --> 45:38.345
She's venomous like her mama.

45:38.347 --> 45:39.281
Ain't ya, Dolores?

45:41.617 --> 45:43.986
So, what do you want?

45:45.154 --> 45:46.522
I heard Henry left you.

45:49.358 --> 45:52.125
Everybody seems to know
about my personal life.

45:52.127 --> 45:53.730
I feel like a fucking celebrity.

45:55.464 --> 45:57.867
Yeah, he'll be back.

45:59.234 --> 46:02.335
Mm, of course he will.

46:02.337 --> 46:04.271
Who could resist you?

46:04.273 --> 46:05.773
Try Catholics.

46:05.775 --> 46:08.912
You always do
know how to make me smile.

46:11.013 --> 46:11.980
Anyways.

46:13.115 --> 46:15.083
Anyways, you
know why I'm here.

46:17.887 --> 46:20.088
Yes, I helped him.

46:21.858 --> 46:22.692
Why?

46:23.893 --> 46:26.393
Maybe I like to watch
the thrill of the spill,

46:26.395 --> 46:27.262
just like you.

46:29.331 --> 46:31.264
How could a girl like me

46:31.266 --> 46:33.335
get mad at an answer like that?

46:35.070 --> 46:37.270
Well, I guess we're done here.

46:37.272 --> 46:38.373
Ah, ah, ah.

46:39.909 --> 46:42.576
See if you ever
help him out again,

46:42.578 --> 46:44.946
I'm gonna burn this
place down to the ground,

46:44.948 --> 46:46.980
with you locked inside of it.

46:46.982 --> 46:50.984
And I'll enjoy every last
ash fall to the ground.

46:50.986 --> 46:53.055
Some violence, Alex, ooh.

46:54.156 --> 46:56.860
Relax, I won't help him again.

46:58.862 --> 46:59.696
Thank you.

47:01.096 --> 47:02.697
I know you're going to play
in the high rollers game.

47:02.699 --> 47:03.499
So?

47:04.666 --> 47:06.666
Danny's the best con
man and poker player

47:06.668 --> 47:08.635
I have ever met, Alex.

47:08.637 --> 47:11.273
He walks in with 20,
walks out with 20,000.

47:12.441 --> 47:14.174
Are you trying
to intimidate me?

47:14.176 --> 47:15.010
No, no, no.

47:16.411 --> 47:20.884
You see, Danny's blessing,
his gift if you will,

47:21.483 --> 47:22.549
is his curse.

47:22.551 --> 47:23.385
Remember that.

47:28.557 --> 47:29.424
Duly noted.

47:34.196 --> 47:36.365
Place really does look great.

47:37.533 --> 47:39.301
Don't give me a
reason to ruin it.

47:40.636 --> 47:44.237
And will you be attending
the game tomorrow?

47:44.239 --> 47:47.140
No, I'm going to find Henry.

47:47.142 --> 47:50.110
Oh, so I'll
see you when I see you.

47:50.112 --> 47:52.312
Try knocking next time, Alex.

48:08.564 --> 48:09.398
Daniel Bishop.

48:11.433 --> 48:12.869
Heard you just got out.

48:13.870 --> 48:16.670
It's Danny, Frank, not Daniel.

48:16.672 --> 48:19.272
Anyways, how've ya been?

48:19.274 --> 48:20.540
Get outta my way.

48:20.542 --> 48:22.845
Wait, I have a little
business offer for you.

48:24.212 --> 48:26.646
Whatever it is,
there's no way in hell

48:26.648 --> 48:28.683
I'm cooperating.

48:28.685 --> 48:32.252
There is nothing you could
say in the entire world

48:32.254 --> 48:34.421
that would get me involved.

48:34.423 --> 48:38.393
Nothing, point blank, period.

48:43.900 --> 48:45.432
Two minutes.

48:45.434 --> 48:47.601
Last time I saw
you, you rivered me

48:47.603 --> 48:50.004
on the tournament
and ruined my life.

48:50.006 --> 48:52.574
And you had the same
shit-eating grin on your face!

48:54.109 --> 48:55.810
I saw those photos on Facebook

48:55.812 --> 48:57.377
of your family's
little Hawaii trip.

48:57.379 --> 48:58.913
They looked very nice.

48:58.915 --> 49:01.716
Would've been Europe if
someone hadn't screwed me.

49:01.718 --> 49:03.884
I also saw some
other photos of you

49:03.886 --> 49:05.755
I decided to print out.

49:09.324 --> 49:11.759
You know, Frank, a
20-year old I could see.

49:11.761 --> 49:13.493
Even get behind, literally.

49:14.396 --> 49:16.897
16-year old, nyea.

49:16.899 --> 49:19.635
For Frank, 12 years old, 12?

49:21.670 --> 49:24.071
You know, I know
Alex's brothel is fun,

49:24.073 --> 49:25.305
don't get me wrong,

49:25.307 --> 49:26.539
but I thought that
little

49:26.541 --> 49:28.341
had a height requirement.

49:30.479 --> 49:33.482
I would really hate
to see these photos

49:34.917 --> 49:36.951
get in the hands of the
police or even your wife.

49:36.953 --> 49:40.453
You bastard.

49:40.455 --> 49:42.155
High rollers
game this weekend.

49:42.157 --> 49:43.556
You will help me.

49:43.558 --> 49:46.994
And after you do, I
will burn these photos.

49:46.996 --> 49:48.428
Then I will leave the city,

49:48.430 --> 49:50.898
and you become the number
one player in town.

49:50.900 --> 49:53.466
Why can't.

49:53.468 --> 49:56.503
Oh well, it's the
Merchant's terms, not mine.

49:56.505 --> 50:00.076
What
whatever.

50:01.376 --> 50:02.743
I'll do it.

50:02.745 --> 50:04.080
That's a good boy, Frank.

50:05.380 --> 50:06.214
Dan, Dan!

50:07.984 --> 50:11.752
If I find out
that this arrangement

50:11.754 --> 50:14.421
gets leaked to the
cops, so help me God,

50:14.423 --> 50:16.957
your body will be in the
bottom of the Mississippi

50:16.959 --> 50:18.695
before you even
realize you're wet!

50:21.596 --> 50:23.731
You just cover my
ass, and I'll make sure

50:23.733 --> 50:25.300
nothing gets up yours.

50:26.836 --> 50:28.501
We'll talk more
details this weekend.

50:28.503 --> 50:29.438
Don't be late.

50:43.518 --> 50:44.617
Hello.

50:44.619 --> 50:46.153
Hi, what can I do for you?

50:46.155 --> 50:48.354
I'm a friend of
your Uncle Daniel's.

50:48.356 --> 50:49.556
Is he home?

50:49.558 --> 50:51.158
No, but I've
been expecting you.

50:51.160 --> 50:52.893
Oh you have, have you?

50:52.895 --> 50:55.361
Yes, I assume
you're Alex, correct?

50:55.363 --> 50:56.563
Yeah.

50:56.565 --> 50:58.032
Danny told me
you'd be stopping by.

50:58.034 --> 50:59.299
Oh he did.

50:59.301 --> 51:00.400
Yes, he also said
you're very pretty

51:00.402 --> 51:02.203
and manipulative.

51:02.205 --> 51:04.537
Oh
sounds about right.

51:04.539 --> 51:07.340
He said you're like an evil
queen from a Disney movie.

51:07.342 --> 51:09.946
Pretty on the outside,
but ugly on the inside.

51:11.180 --> 51:13.047
Well I'm flattered.

51:13.049 --> 51:15.816
Lisa, do you know
why I'm really here?

51:15.818 --> 51:17.517
Well, to get at me, of course.

51:17.519 --> 51:19.053
Use me as leverage against Danny

51:19.055 --> 51:20.453
at the poker
tournament, in hopes

51:20.455 --> 51:22.191
it will psych him
out so he loses.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.961
Did he forget to tell
you that if he does lose,

51:26.963 --> 51:28.763
I'm gonna put you
in a barrel of acid

51:28.765 --> 51:32.632
and make him watch as your
skin falls off your bones?

51:32.634 --> 51:33.868
Basically.

51:33.870 --> 51:35.368
Anyways, we're wasting time.

51:35.370 --> 51:38.873
We should take highway
69, less traffic.

51:38.875 --> 51:40.977
We wouldn't want to
be late now, would we?

51:42.078 --> 51:44.044
I can't decide whether
to give you a job

51:44.046 --> 51:45.246
or kill you now.

51:45.248 --> 51:46.646
The feeling's mutual.

51:46.648 --> 51:47.884
After you, Alex.

52:05.101 --> 52:06.466
That was Louis!

52:06.468 --> 52:07.300
Who?

52:07.302 --> 52:08.535
I hate him.

52:08.537 --> 52:09.502
He makes fun of
my friend, Shawn.

52:09.504 --> 52:10.738
Why?

52:10.740 --> 52:13.406
Because Shawn has
two moms without a dad.

52:13.408 --> 52:14.909
Driver, follow that boy.

52:14.911 --> 52:16.442
Get in front of him.

52:16.444 --> 52:17.914
Cut him off over by the tree.

52:31.194 --> 52:32.525
Hello, Louis.

52:32.527 --> 52:33.593
What do you want?

52:33.595 --> 52:34.527
I heard you've been making fun

52:34.529 --> 52:35.763
of my friend, Shawn.

52:35.765 --> 52:37.532
Yeah what, are
you his third mom?

52:38.701 --> 52:41.836
No, I like my women
a little more venomous.

52:41.838 --> 52:44.071
I'm what you call the
negative side of karma,

52:44.073 --> 52:45.538
in the flesh.

52:45.540 --> 52:46.774
What do you mean?

52:46.776 --> 52:48.376
Oh, don't worry,
I'll explain later.

52:49.644 --> 52:52.347
So, why are you
making fun of Shawn?

52:53.515 --> 52:55.783
Because he's a pussy,
like his dyke moms.

52:55.785 --> 52:59.119
Oh, I
remember kids like you

52:59.121 --> 53:00.587
when I was growing up.

53:00.589 --> 53:02.524
Used to pick on me because
I fucked.

53:04.260 --> 53:07.296
See, most of those
children, fortunately Louis,

53:08.396 --> 53:09.564
are no longer with us.

53:11.033 --> 53:12.867
Whatever, I'm outta here.

53:12.869 --> 53:15.635
Louis, wait, I have
something for you.

53:15.637 --> 53:16.471
What?

53:18.573 --> 53:21.275
A $20 bill, and I
want you to have it.

53:21.277 --> 53:22.778
Really, why?

53:23.980 --> 53:25.378
I'll give it to
you, but you gotta

53:25.380 --> 53:26.816
promise me something first.

53:27.783 --> 53:29.382
What do you want?

53:29.384 --> 53:31.685
Come a little closer
and I'll tell you.

53:31.687 --> 53:32.853
I'm close enough.

53:32.855 --> 53:35.756
Louis, come a little closer.

53:35.758 --> 53:37.459
Fine.

53:39.228 --> 53:43.964
If you ever make fun of
Shawn or anyone ever again,

53:43.966 --> 53:45.799
I'm gonna cut off
your mother's head

53:45.801 --> 53:47.234
and I'm gonna rip your
father's intestines out

53:47.236 --> 53:48.769
and hang you by the roof.

53:48.771 --> 53:50.436
Let me go!

53:50.438 --> 53:51.272
Promise!

53:51.274 --> 53:52.275
I promise!

53:53.342 --> 53:55.776
Here's your 20.

53:55.778 --> 53:56.744
I don't think he's
gonna be making fun

53:56.746 --> 53:58.178
of anyone ever again.

53:58.180 --> 53:59.348
Driver, door.

54:07.757 --> 54:12.762
Ah, best thing in life,
taking what's not yours

54:13.930 --> 54:15.932
and getting away with it.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.668
And getting a good
night's sleep.

54:21.737 --> 54:22.570
Show time.

54:28.277 --> 54:29.777
You
doin' okay, Frank?

54:32.480 --> 54:33.716
Hiya Frank.

54:34.951 --> 54:35.785
Miss me?

54:37.086 --> 54:39.286
How were the girls last week?

54:39.288 --> 54:40.220
Nearly broke my chair.

54:40.222 --> 54:43.623
Oh so you nervous?

54:43.625 --> 54:46.026
Big game, lots a money.

54:46.028 --> 54:47.229
I'm sure I'll do fine.

54:48.630 --> 54:49.797
Fine?

54:49.799 --> 54:51.631
Wouldn't it be
better to be great?

54:51.633 --> 54:53.033
Don't you play to win?

54:53.035 --> 54:56.170
I mean, you do have
a family and all.

54:56.172 --> 54:58.538
And a business, I might add.

54:58.540 --> 55:00.640
How's that going anyway?

55:00.642 --> 55:01.576
Stocks are up.

55:03.079 --> 55:05.179
Too bad they weren't always.

55:05.181 --> 55:06.380
Too bad.

55:06.382 --> 55:10.384
Hm, what if I told
you I had a magical wand

55:10.386 --> 55:12.188
that could take
care of that always?

55:13.189 --> 55:14.056
Not interested.

55:15.224 --> 55:18.726
Frank, I thought you
were a businessman.

55:18.728 --> 55:19.960
I wouldn't want a man like you

55:19.962 --> 55:22.031
to be made a fool of by Daniel.

55:23.165 --> 55:24.666
What, you care about me now?

55:28.636 --> 55:30.904
I care about the
same thing you do.

55:30.906 --> 55:33.606
A bottle of gin and
a one night stand?

55:33.608 --> 55:34.443
Winning.

55:36.212 --> 55:38.914
And I have all the money
you could ever imagine.

55:40.349 --> 55:42.485
You know Frank, me and
you, we're the same.

55:44.220 --> 55:45.753
We play to win.

55:45.755 --> 55:48.455
So many Americans
play not to lose.

55:48.457 --> 55:51.591
Do you think that
Carnegie, Rockefeller, Jobs

55:51.593 --> 55:53.093
play not to lose?

55:53.095 --> 55:57.331
No, they play foot to ass
and they take no prisoners.

55:57.333 --> 55:58.134
Go on.

55:59.902 --> 56:01.837
We all know Daniel
likes to drink.

56:04.206 --> 56:07.975
Do me a favor, put
this in his drink.

56:07.977 --> 56:08.811
And this is?

56:10.513 --> 56:12.246
Just something to
make him a little loopy.

56:12.248 --> 56:14.383
I mean, nothing more
than a truth serum.

56:15.951 --> 56:19.889
Do this, Frank, and you'll
never need to work again.

56:22.258 --> 56:23.092
Deal?

56:25.660 --> 56:26.462
Deal.

56:27.997 --> 56:28.831
Ah, the life.

56:30.199 --> 56:32.565
Oh Frank, I really
do hope this is

56:32.567 --> 56:35.204
a long, prosperous
business plan.

56:36.138 --> 56:37.440
The girls will be waiting.

56:38.541 --> 56:39.674
So next Thursday?

56:40.976 --> 56:41.977
As always.

56:55.324 --> 56:57.491
Frank, you good-lookin' SOB.

56:57.493 --> 56:59.295
How'd I know you'd
be at the bar?

57:01.197 --> 57:03.297
Can you just do your
thing and we'll be fine?

57:03.299 --> 57:04.965
Oh I will, looks like
you need a little help.

57:04.967 --> 57:07.667
What, I'll grab you a
drink, just go grab a table.

57:09.205 --> 57:10.437
What was that?

57:10.439 --> 57:11.905
Go grab a table, Dan.

57:11.907 --> 57:13.373
All right, all
right, all right.

57:13.375 --> 57:14.443
Don't take too long.

57:18.613 --> 57:19.448
Mick.

57:21.784 --> 57:26.055
Can I get a double scotch
and another one of these?

57:34.563 --> 57:35.397
Thanks.

58:03.159 --> 58:04.458
So you're probably
wondering whether

58:04.460 --> 58:06.693
I'll be able to pull this off.

58:06.695 --> 58:08.962
And you're probably
wondering how good

58:08.964 --> 58:10.731
I actually am.

58:10.733 --> 58:12.699
Well, I had a good teacher.

58:12.701 --> 58:14.067
And what you should
also be asking is,

58:14.069 --> 58:16.172
"Danny, how did
you get so good?"

58:17.873 --> 58:19.606
Well, main thing
to always realize

58:19.608 --> 58:22.376
is it's not gambling,
it's deception.

58:22.378 --> 58:25.479
You can play the math and
the odds all you want,

58:25.481 --> 58:27.447
but the one thing
that always gets you

58:27.449 --> 58:30.586
to the final table is your
image and table presence.

58:31.720 --> 58:33.754
For example, this old thing.

58:33.756 --> 58:34.988
She's looking to get a flush

58:34.990 --> 58:36.290
and she currently
has two spades.

58:36.292 --> 58:38.158
I know this because
she can't take her eyes

58:38.160 --> 58:40.060
off the two on
board as we speak.

58:40.062 --> 58:42.563
Her tell is, well,
it's the fact she keeps

58:42.565 --> 58:45.065
stroking her stack of chips.

58:45.067 --> 58:46.033
It's not smart to
give your chips

58:46.035 --> 58:48.101
a hand job while staring off.

58:48.103 --> 58:49.636
You see, if you're
holding two spades

58:49.638 --> 58:51.471
and there are two
more on the board,

58:51.473 --> 58:53.073
along with the other
card, that leaves

58:53.075 --> 58:57.044
52 minus five, between
47 cards, of which

58:57.046 --> 59:00.414
13 minus four equal
nine more spades.

59:00.416 --> 59:02.216
The chance of hitting
the flush on a turn

59:02.218 --> 59:06.887
is nine divide 47,
equaling 19.15%

59:06.889 --> 59:08.889
which is about one in five.

59:08.891 --> 59:10.190
If you don't hit on the turn,

59:10.192 --> 59:11.592
your chance of hitting the river

59:11.594 --> 59:16.063
is nine divide 46,
equaling 19.57%.

59:16.065 --> 59:19.199
So with all those variables
taken into consideration,

59:19.201 --> 59:22.771
roughly she has a 35%
chance of getting the flush.

59:23.939 --> 59:25.973
Now her next step
is to raise gently.

59:25.975 --> 59:28.508
She doesn't want to come
across too confident.

59:28.510 --> 59:30.143
And I'm gonna go all
in because I'm buying

59:30.145 --> 59:31.478
my way out of my bluff.

59:31.480 --> 59:33.082
That's right, I have nothing.

59:34.183 --> 59:36.583
And she wants to
call, but that little

59:36.585 --> 59:39.353
cautionary voice in
her head won't go away,

59:39.355 --> 59:42.289
and in five seconds,
she'll fold.

59:42.291 --> 59:45.928
Five,
four, three, two, one.

59:47.363 --> 59:48.197
I fold.

59:50.833 --> 59:51.667
Thank you.

59:52.868 --> 59:54.702
I knew
you had the full house.

59:54.704 --> 59:56.103
Oh, of course, you made

59:56.105 --> 59:59.174
a marvelous decision,
let me assure you.

01:00:12.087 --> 01:00:15.088
Ah, so as I said
earlier, table presence,

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.224
image, is what matters.

01:00:17.226 --> 01:00:18.726
Math comes second.

01:00:18.728 --> 01:00:20.661
I mean, just can't you tell
by the stack of my chips?

01:00:20.663 --> 01:00:23.630
Oh, and as the old bag
illustrated earlier,

01:00:23.632 --> 01:00:26.701
easy tell is don't give
your chips a hand job.

01:01:20.322 --> 01:01:21.156
Ah!

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:25.060
So this is it, boys.

01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:29.797
This is it.

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:33.367
Just before we start,
aces are good, right?

01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:35.369
Only queens,
Daniel, just like your niece.

01:01:35.371 --> 01:01:36.470
Right, Lisa?

01:01:36.472 --> 01:01:38.271
That's the rumor.

01:01:38.273 --> 01:01:42.810
Oh yes, queens, dames, always

01:01:42.812 --> 01:01:44.644
getting the best of me.

01:01:44.646 --> 01:01:46.546
That's because you're no ace.

01:01:46.548 --> 01:01:48.982
I know, I'm
I'm a magician.

01:01:48.984 --> 01:01:51.118
Oh really, do tell.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.085
All right
ladies and gentlemen,

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:54.020
can we please focus on the game?

01:01:54.022 --> 01:01:56.824
Well, I wanted to
be, but my father

01:01:56.826 --> 01:01:59.794
didn't approve and I
begged and I begged

01:01:59.796 --> 01:02:00.961
and then he broke my leg.

01:02:00.963 --> 01:02:03.463
That's how I got the limp.

01:02:03.465 --> 01:02:05.667
That's it, that's the story?

01:02:07.236 --> 01:02:09.903
Dealer, I've become
bored with Texas Holdem.

01:02:09.905 --> 01:02:11.806
I'm feeling a little
bit more nostalgic.

01:02:11.808 --> 01:02:13.573
Five card draw?

01:02:13.575 --> 01:02:14.842
Any complaints?

01:02:14.844 --> 01:02:16.643
Hey, it's your world,
we're just living in it.

01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:17.781
Sure, why not?

01:02:18.748 --> 01:02:20.480
Dealer, you can deal now.

01:02:20.482 --> 01:02:23.650
I'll say, I'll say when
you can do it, Dealer.

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:26.953
You can, you can do
it, you can do it.

01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:28.221
All right, ladies
and gentlemen.

01:02:28.223 --> 01:02:30.023
This is the final table.

01:02:30.025 --> 01:02:32.325
We'll conclude with
the five card draw.

01:02:32.327 --> 01:02:35.130
Aces are high, ante, $10,000.

01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:42.936
You know, Daniel, only a
monster can out-monster another.

01:02:42.938 --> 01:02:45.939
I mean, it only makes
sense we collide,

01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:47.976
being the two major
forces in the city.

01:02:50.612 --> 01:02:51.879
Bless you.

01:02:51.881 --> 01:02:53.714
Thanks, Alex.

01:02:53.716 --> 01:02:55.685
There's only one
monster in this room.

01:02:56.686 --> 01:02:59.186
That's why I run the city.

01:02:59.188 --> 01:03:02.389
Whoever said I was
talking about you?

01:03:02.391 --> 01:03:03.225
I bet $15,000.

01:03:04.894 --> 01:03:06.195
I'll raise you $30,000.

01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:10.399
I can do that.

01:03:13.268 --> 01:03:16.938
You know, Alex, we're
not so different.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.540
I mean, we were both
rejected by our families

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:21.843
and misunderstood.

01:03:21.845 --> 01:03:25.080
I mean, we're survivors.

01:03:26.248 --> 01:03:28.515
I didn't know you were
such an intellectual.

01:03:28.517 --> 01:03:29.518
Dealer, give me two.

01:03:31.688 --> 01:03:33.055
I have my moments.

01:03:34.323 --> 01:03:36.926
I'll take, dealer,
I'll take three.

01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:40.728
Three, dealer.

01:03:42.097 --> 01:03:43.965
I know you're
getting bored, Lisa.

01:03:43.967 --> 01:03:45.534
But this will all be over soon.

01:03:46.736 --> 01:03:50.103
Daniel, do you
know what we really are?

01:03:50.105 --> 01:03:52.572
Criminals, uh, gamblers?

01:03:52.574 --> 01:03:54.241
Apex predators.

01:03:54.243 --> 01:03:56.610
We're at the top of
the food chain, honey.

01:03:56.612 --> 01:03:59.816
We control the eco-system
and we maintain the city.

01:04:03.085 --> 01:04:04.150
You sound
like a politician.

01:04:04.152 --> 01:04:05.920
You shoulda ran for office.

01:04:05.922 --> 01:04:07.120
Don't need to.

01:04:07.122 --> 01:04:08.655
They're already
all in bed with me.

01:04:08.657 --> 01:04:11.558
And you watch too much
"National Geographic."

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.360
This is
gonna be a long game.

01:04:13.362 --> 01:04:15.832
Dealer, you can give me three.

01:04:19.034 --> 01:04:20.868
You two are both wrong.

01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:22.569
You know what you are?

01:04:22.571 --> 01:04:23.603
Buckthorn.

01:04:23.605 --> 01:04:24.471
Buckthorn?

01:04:24.473 --> 01:04:26.139
Yeah, Buckthorn.

01:04:26.141 --> 01:04:29.109
It's a tree that kills
other trees in the forest

01:04:29.111 --> 01:04:31.979
by spreading itself
around like a cancer,

01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:35.348
out-competing native
plants and trees for sun.

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:39.221
It thrives on weakness and
prospers without any shame.

01:04:41.456 --> 01:04:42.624
Yeah, I'm goin' all in.

01:04:44.861 --> 01:04:45.695
I'll call.

01:04:46.896 --> 01:04:50.765
Alex Buckthorn, oh I do
like the sound of that.

01:04:50.767 --> 01:04:53.066
However, Frank, what
does that make you?

01:04:53.068 --> 01:04:55.669
Just a simple Irishman
trying to make his way

01:04:55.671 --> 01:04:57.172
through the storm called life.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.442
All right,
show me what you got.

01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:07.080
Before we show our
cards, do you feel that?

01:05:07.082 --> 01:05:08.415
Feel what, Frank?

01:05:08.417 --> 01:05:11.318
That edge-like feeling
of being in control,

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.520
yet you don't know
what the future holds.

01:05:13.522 --> 01:05:16.491
And at any second you could
gain or lose everything.

01:05:17.894 --> 01:05:19.794
The home of the unknown.

01:05:19.796 --> 01:05:21.630
That's what drives
me to this game.

01:05:22.865 --> 01:05:24.333
Just call, show me.

01:05:25.802 --> 01:05:29.036
My favorite, full house.

01:05:29.038 --> 01:05:30.006
Four fours.

01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:33.475
Pair of kings.

01:05:34.844 --> 01:05:37.646
Well, that's the end of me.

01:05:38.848 --> 01:05:40.580
I suppose there's always
next year, right Danny?

01:05:40.582 --> 01:05:42.051
Ta ta, everyone.

01:05:45.287 --> 01:05:46.689
It's you and me now, Alex.

01:05:49.826 --> 01:05:54.028
Time to remind you what
a betta fish is, Daniel.

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:55.295
Tell you what.

01:05:55.297 --> 01:05:57.430
I do like climax, so
I'm gonna make this

01:05:57.432 --> 01:06:00.737
interesting and quick,
like my Brazilian wax.

01:06:02.805 --> 01:06:06.107
You get a full house,
I'll let you live,

01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:07.609
but little Lisa here will die.

01:06:09.012 --> 01:06:12.178
You get a four of a
kind, I'll let you live

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.448
and Lisa live.

01:06:15.051 --> 01:06:16.817
I'm all ears, go on.

01:06:16.819 --> 01:06:19.386
But then there's a choice.

01:06:19.388 --> 01:06:22.890
Daddy, Daddy!

01:06:22.892 --> 01:06:24.025
Shut her up!

01:06:24.027 --> 01:06:25.028
Shut her up.

01:06:26.662 --> 01:06:28.294
Everybody shut up.

01:06:28.296 --> 01:06:32.399
Nobody moves, we are
finishing this god damn game.

01:06:35.537 --> 01:06:38.005
Arthur here will die.

01:06:38.007 --> 01:06:40.640
And in the rare occasion
that you beat me,

01:06:40.642 --> 01:06:44.346
and I mean rare, I'll
let you all live.

01:06:45.882 --> 01:06:49.217
See how Democratic
I can be, Daniel?

01:06:50.519 --> 01:06:55.524
I'm sorry.

01:06:56.859 --> 01:06:58.460
I'm sorry, I'll stop.

01:07:02.065 --> 01:07:02.899
Are you done?

01:07:06.736 --> 01:07:09.170
Yes

01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:10.907
So what's the catch,
Richard Nixon?

01:07:12.474 --> 01:07:15.277
I'll call and you
show me your cards.

01:07:23.585 --> 01:07:24.419
Whew!

01:07:25.922 --> 01:07:30.193
As I once said, I
am the betta fish.

01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:34.362
Aces high, Daniel.

01:07:35.865 --> 01:07:37.064
I think I should just kill you

01:07:37.066 --> 01:07:38.868
and your whole family
out of principle.

01:07:40.469 --> 01:07:42.435
Well what do you have, Alex?

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:45.041
Oh.

01:07:47.242 --> 01:07:48.608
Four of a kind.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:49.611
Uh ma'am,

01:07:50.813 --> 01:07:54.481
you have nothing.

01:07:54.483 --> 01:07:55.818
This is
my favorite part.

01:07:56.686 --> 01:08:00.253
Fuck.

01:08:00.255 --> 01:08:02.223
This isn't over, Daniel!

01:08:02.225 --> 01:08:03.523
His name is Danny.

01:08:03.525 --> 01:08:04.191
Eh, I think
I called your bluff.

01:08:04.193 --> 01:08:05.391
And it's over.

01:08:05.393 --> 01:08:07.327
It was a pleasure
meeting you, goodbye!

01:08:07.329 --> 01:08:09.096
Anyway!

01:08:09.098 --> 01:08:10.597
What the fuck happened, Violet?

01:08:10.599 --> 01:08:13.200
Was anyone watching
that fucking

01:08:13.202 --> 01:08:14.667
Sure glad I called her bluff.

01:08:14.669 --> 01:08:16.502
God damn it, who
was watching the little girl?

01:08:16.505 --> 01:08:17.506
God damn it!

01:08:33.022 --> 01:08:34.788
Did you have fun, Arthur?

01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:35.725
Fuck you.

01:08:37.126 --> 01:08:39.193
Oh you know, I would
really like to untie you,

01:08:39.194 --> 01:08:42.562
but you still look a
little wound up right now.

01:08:42.564 --> 01:08:45.099
So I'm just gonna
leave you tied for now.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.966
You can consider
that payback for when

01:08:46.969 --> 01:08:50.173
you used to fart on me
when I was a little kid.

01:08:51.808 --> 01:08:55.109
All right, Bishop
family, let's go.

01:08:55.111 --> 01:08:58.580
Party's over, Danny wins again.

01:08:59.881 --> 01:09:01.314
Just joking, come on.

01:09:01.316 --> 01:09:02.350
Not funny.

01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:18.067
Danny?

01:09:20.136 --> 01:09:21.368
I need to know something.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.706
Oh, I know.

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:28.943
You're wondering how
I won so effortlessly.

01:09:28.944 --> 01:09:31.080
Well I guess I just didn't
know you were that good.

01:09:32.014 --> 01:09:32.846
How did you know?

01:09:32.849 --> 01:09:34.515
I mean, how did you win?

01:09:35.984 --> 01:09:38.384
Well big brother, I have
a rare and unique talent.

01:09:38.386 --> 01:09:40.888
But to describe it to
someone such as yourself,

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:44.492
I'd have to do it in a
very rudimentary way.

01:09:46.361 --> 01:09:49.298
Essentially, I just rigged
the game in my favor.

01:09:50.465 --> 01:09:51.300
You cheated.

01:09:53.102 --> 01:09:54.335
Well yeah, of course.

01:09:54.337 --> 01:09:55.870
I mean, I wasn't
gonna risk losing,

01:09:55.872 --> 01:09:57.670
if it meant that
they would kill me.

01:09:57.672 --> 01:09:59.539
Of course, you and Lisa as well.

01:09:59.541 --> 01:10:01.641
Jesus, Danny,
you're a cheater?

01:10:01.643 --> 01:10:02.843
Well yeah!

01:10:02.845 --> 01:10:04.444
I mean, you're alive,
everything's okay.

01:10:04.446 --> 01:10:05.880
You're welcome, by the way.

01:10:05.882 --> 01:10:07.248
Have you always been cheating?

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:10.050
Yes, Arthur,
sometimes but who cares?

01:10:10.052 --> 01:10:11.417
No honor.

01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:14.054
Honor, who the hell
are you, the Dalai Lama?

01:10:14.056 --> 01:10:15.990
Look, how did you know
it was gonna work out?

01:10:15.992 --> 01:10:17.260
How were so damn certain?

01:10:19.028 --> 01:10:23.197
Well, when I was prison,
no one laid a hand on me.

01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:26.901
Which I found very odd,
considering how good-looking I am.

01:10:26.903 --> 01:10:28.401
And I knew once I got
out I'd have to pay up

01:10:28.403 --> 01:10:30.304
because I was being protected.

01:10:30.306 --> 01:10:31.805
You're not that good-looking.

01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:33.075
Anyways.

01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:36.377
Wait a minute, you
said that you were

01:10:36.379 --> 01:10:38.848
stabbed in the leg
when you were in there.

01:10:39.882 --> 01:10:41.916
No, I was limping around

01:10:41.918 --> 01:10:43.416
so everyone would
feel sorry for me.

01:10:43.418 --> 01:10:44.720
You are sick.

01:10:45.888 --> 01:10:47.487
Oh I'm a natural
born con man, Arthur.

01:10:47.489 --> 01:10:48.722
What can I say?

01:10:48.724 --> 01:10:50.724
Yeah, how can I forget?

01:10:50.726 --> 01:10:53.062
Anyways, back
to my explanation.

01:10:54.429 --> 01:10:56.496
So I had a hunch Alex
was gonna threaten

01:10:56.498 --> 01:10:58.032
me and my family.

01:10:58.034 --> 01:11:00.834
Of course, she would love
to see me suffer agony.

01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:02.568
I figured what better
way to lure her in

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:04.437
than a high stakes
poker tournament.

01:11:04.439 --> 01:11:06.539
I knew her jealousy
would fill her with rage

01:11:06.541 --> 01:11:08.641
and fuel her to try and beat me.

01:11:08.643 --> 01:11:11.378
Naturally she would try
and rig the game, too,

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.280
by buying off Frank.

01:11:13.282 --> 01:11:15.883
So I made him a better deal.

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:17.251
For leverage, I
knew she would try

01:11:17.253 --> 01:11:19.286
and kidnap Lisa,
but I knew she would

01:11:19.288 --> 01:11:20.821
never harm a little girl.

01:11:20.823 --> 01:11:23.656
See, Alex rose to power
by human trafficking.

01:11:23.658 --> 01:11:26.827
My favorite part is, Lisa
did most of the work.

01:11:26.829 --> 01:11:29.763
I taught her how to play
poker when I got out of jail.

01:11:29.765 --> 01:11:31.398
My instincts also
told me Alex would

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.434
keep Lisa close
for intimidation.

01:11:33.436 --> 01:11:35.468
That played
beautifully in my con.

01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:37.237
You see, when Alex
had a high hand,

01:11:37.239 --> 01:11:38.706
Lisa would scratch her nose.

01:11:38.708 --> 01:11:41.342
When she had a low hand,
Lisa would sneeze and yawn.

01:11:41.344 --> 01:11:42.608
Alex had a low-level con,

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:44.544
keeping extra
cards in her purse.

01:11:44.546 --> 01:11:45.879
Really bad move.

01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:48.749
I had Lisa make the pull
right under her nose.

01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:50.384
She waited until the final hand

01:11:50.386 --> 01:11:53.120
to replace Alex's
cards with useless ones

01:11:53.122 --> 01:11:55.588
to ensure that I won ace high,

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:57.893
obviously leaving Alex
with absolutely nothing.

01:12:00.528 --> 01:12:02.096
The hardest part,
Arthur, honestly

01:12:02.098 --> 01:12:04.164
was just keeping a straight
face through that whole con.

01:12:04.166 --> 01:12:05.665
Not laughing.

01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:07.968
The funny thing, too,
is I had all the money

01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:09.903
to pay off Alex 10 times over.

01:12:09.905 --> 01:12:12.041
It's buried under the
tree in the backyard.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:15.144
How much?

01:12:16.979 --> 01:12:20.214
Well, if you wanna
know, you'll just

01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:22.615
have to dig it up and find out.

01:12:22.617 --> 01:12:23.518
Of course.

01:12:24.787 --> 01:12:27.388
Hey, there's something
in the glove compartment

01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:28.824
I've been meaning to give you.

01:12:34.463 --> 01:12:36.564
This is from Christmas!

01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:39.068
Yeah.

01:12:40.803 --> 01:12:42.736
You remember when you
fell through the ice

01:12:42.738 --> 01:12:44.907
with your brand new
skates, playing hockey?

01:12:45.841 --> 01:12:48.511
Yeah, you came and rescued me.

01:12:50.312 --> 01:12:51.211
I've never seen you so scared

01:12:51.213 --> 01:12:52.415
in my entire life.

01:12:53.349 --> 01:12:55.249
I was sick for a week.

01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:56.417
But as a bonus, it was worth it.

01:12:56.419 --> 01:12:57.953
I got to miss a week of school.

01:13:00.289 --> 01:13:01.991
It's not easy being
brothers, huh?

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:04.393
No it isn't.

01:13:05.928 --> 01:13:07.928
But we make do, don't we?

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.562
Bishops always do.

01:13:09.564 --> 01:13:10.399
That's right.

01:13:14.236 --> 01:13:15.771
Well, thanks for the ride.

01:13:21.576 --> 01:13:24.378
Hey, is there really money

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.182
buried under that maple tree?

01:13:29.418 --> 01:13:30.252
Perhaps.

01:13:39.261 --> 01:13:40.160
You boys doin' okay?

01:13:40.162 --> 01:13:41.095
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:13:41.097 --> 01:13:43.130
All right, what do ya got?

01:13:43.132 --> 01:13:46.567
I have a pair of twos.

01:13:46.569 --> 01:13:48.836
I have a 10 high.

01:13:48.838 --> 01:13:49.671
Double ace.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.705
- Double aces?
- You got a pair of aces?

01:13:51.707 --> 01:13:52.773
Are you serious?

01:13:52.775 --> 01:13:54.074
Again?

01:13:54.076 --> 01:13:55.342
What do you mean, again?

01:13:55.344 --> 01:13:56.944
- You just had aces.
- You just had that.

01:13:56.946 --> 01:13:58.212
Double aces.

01:13:58.214 --> 01:14:00.314
Hey, you in the fancy jacket.

01:14:00.316 --> 01:14:02.549
You know how to play poker?

01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:04.051
We need one more.

01:14:04.053 --> 01:14:06.120
Well, it's funny you ask.

01:14:06.122 --> 01:14:07.653
I've been told I'm okay, but I

01:14:07.655 --> 01:14:09.289
personally don't
think I'm that good.

01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:10.190
Oh really?

01:14:10.192 --> 01:14:11.825
Well, you got any money?

01:14:11.827 --> 01:14:13.127
Just a little bit.

01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:13.961
Just a little bit.

01:14:13.963 --> 01:14:14.795
Just a little bit.

01:14:14.797 --> 01:14:17.064
Hm, it's a $50 buy-in.

01:14:17.066 --> 01:14:18.298
I think I can manage that.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.733
- Have a chair.
- Manage that.

01:14:19.735 --> 01:14:20.635
Come on, hm.

01:14:22.204 --> 01:14:23.937
How'd you get your limp?

01:14:23.939 --> 01:14:24.773
Well.

01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:53.281
