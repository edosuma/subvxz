00:01.988 --> 00:04.479
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:04.480 --> 00:08.269
The idea of Atlantis,
a lost culture,

00:08.270 --> 00:11.689
has fascinated many
for generations,

00:11.690 --> 00:15.039
what wisdom was
there and only there,

00:15.040 --> 00:18.029
the places we go are
at the tipping point,

00:18.030 --> 00:22.509
their existence threatened
in a very real way.

00:22.510 --> 00:25.809
We'll explore areas fighting
a ticking clock joined

00:25.810 --> 00:27.969
by young and
passionate locals who

00:27.970 --> 00:31.389
won't back down from the
challenges to their homeland.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.579
Let's celebrate
what's unique, what

00:33.580 --> 00:36.945
we should cherish and protect
before the whole thing could

00:36.946 --> 00:38.175
be washed away.

00:38.176 --> 00:41.620
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:49.984 --> 00:53.428
(WAVES CRASHING)

00:58.360 --> 01:01.159
Welcome to the Maldives,
a group of 1,200 islands

01:01.160 --> 01:03.839
and 300,000 residents
in the Indian Ocean.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.909
It's an Islamic republic
where tourists flock

01:05.910 --> 01:09.929
from all cultures for sun,
relaxation, world class

01:09.930 --> 01:11.849
diving and surf.

01:11.850 --> 01:15.269
This turquoise blue ocean is
the country's greatest friend,

01:15.270 --> 01:17.220
but it could also be
its greatest threat.

01:20.030 --> 01:22.939
We're standing on what
is the lowest lying

01:22.940 --> 01:26.449
nation on the planet, which
means one perfect wave

01:26.450 --> 01:28.189
or rise in sea level
of just three feet

01:28.190 --> 01:30.699
makes this nation uninhabitable.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.359
Meaning there's a
high probability

01:32.360 --> 01:37.369
that the Maldives can soon
become modern Atlantis.

01:37.370 --> 01:40.640
I'm Josh Burstein, and we're
here to get a last glimpse.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.739
To get to know a place
like the Maldives,

01:46.740 --> 01:48.809
it's good to have a
man on the inside,

01:48.810 --> 01:50.789
and I knew just the guy.

01:50.790 --> 01:51.750
Meet Kevin.

01:51.751 --> 01:53.979
He hails from Mali,
the capital city,

01:53.980 --> 01:56.669
where he seems to be friends
with all his neighbors.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.609
More on that later.

01:58.610 --> 02:00.459
Kevin agreed to take
me under his wing,

02:00.460 --> 02:02.629
and on this trip, leaning
on someone like him

02:02.630 --> 02:04.589
makes all the difference.

02:04.590 --> 02:07.309
I started to pick up
local tricks of the trade.

02:07.310 --> 02:08.609
What do you do with your hands?

02:08.610 --> 02:09.479
We just...

02:09.479 --> 02:09.979
Hug it?

02:09.979 --> 02:10.660
Hug it.

02:10.660 --> 02:11.225
All right.

02:11.226 --> 02:12.600
But the legs should
be like this.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.369
One more, one more.

02:20.370 --> 02:21.399
I got it.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.049
I have no idea how to get down.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.749
I was in good hands with
Kevin, but before our journey

02:25.750 --> 02:28.239
could go any further I
needed to see the way

02:28.240 --> 02:30.064
most foreigners
experienced the Maldives.

02:30.065 --> 02:33.370
(MUSIC PLAYING)

02:37.870 --> 02:39.629
The rest of the world
knows this nation

02:39.630 --> 02:43.199
as a haven, resort life with
picturesque postcard views

02:43.200 --> 02:44.649
true to form.

02:44.650 --> 02:46.949
I had to check out what
these tourists are getting

02:46.950 --> 02:48.969
to know what they're missing.

02:48.970 --> 02:52.229
It was a hard choice, but
somebody had to do it.

02:52.230 --> 02:54.569
When you plan your
paradise honeymoon

02:54.570 --> 02:56.729
you think of those huts
that just levitate right

02:56.730 --> 02:59.039
above the tranquil water.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.499
This one came with
a glass bottom tub.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.279
Tourism is thriving as it may
be a last shot for Western elite

03:05.280 --> 03:07.739
to enjoy all these amenities.

03:07.740 --> 03:13.169
Amenities like eating with
the fish under the sea.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.010
Not a bad view.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.659
Cuisine says a lot
about a culture.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.569
And upstairs in
the main kitchen,

03:20.570 --> 03:23.879
Ishaaq is an award winning
chef and considered something

03:23.880 --> 03:26.219
of an ambassador to
the Maldivian palate.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.199
We sat down to swap recipes.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.249
Maldivian cuisine is
strong flavor dish,

03:32.250 --> 03:35.789
which has all kinds of curry
spices, cinnamon, cardamom,

03:35.790 --> 03:37.779
coriander.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.239
We're in the thick of it.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.609
Maldivians tend to
like spicy foods.

03:41.610 --> 03:43.439
Everybody likes spicy food.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.439
The chef gave me a quick crash
course on Maldivian spices

03:46.440 --> 03:48.299
and prepared a few of
his favorite dishes

03:48.300 --> 03:49.230
for me to sample.

03:49.231 --> 03:51.749
I have Maldivian
traditional Garudiya,

03:51.750 --> 03:55.869
which is fish boiled with water,
adding of raanbaa and curry

03:55.870 --> 03:56.370
leaves.

03:56.371 --> 03:59.579
I'm going to add cardamom
with pods because then it

03:59.580 --> 04:00.829
gets the flavor.

04:00.830 --> 04:04.089
So this is nice coconut
flavored Maldivian soup.

04:04.090 --> 04:07.559
We call that Kiru Garudhiya.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.599
Yeah, yummy.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.619
They got a good
thing going here.

04:10.620 --> 04:13.539
I settled in and enjoyed a
full bowl of Chef Ishaaq's

04:13.540 --> 04:14.854
Kiru Garudhiya.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.228
It was hard to
tell what to enjoy

04:16.230 --> 04:18.990
more, the food or that horizon.

04:23.060 --> 04:26.179
In the evening hours, resorts
go all out with beach parties

04:26.180 --> 04:28.609
so guests can let loose.

04:28.610 --> 04:31.199
The Maldives is
a Muslim country,

04:31.200 --> 04:34.459
which means no booze,
no bacon, no porn,

04:34.460 --> 04:36.889
but nightlife
accommodations at resorts

04:36.890 --> 04:40.459
make plenty of
exceptions for travelers.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.649
There are worse fates than this.

04:42.650 --> 04:46.729
Each day I discovered a new
form of luxury and pampering.

04:46.730 --> 04:49.609
I had sat in pretty much every
hanging comfy device known

04:49.610 --> 04:52.589
to man, but it was getting old.

04:52.590 --> 04:54.619
There's a moral hangover
to just sitting still

04:54.620 --> 04:57.079
and watching the tide come in.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.489
I need something new,
I needed a friend.

05:01.490 --> 05:05.419
Fortunately I had Kevin, someone
that knew his way around,

05:05.420 --> 05:07.069
someone that I could trust.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.689
The way I like to
travel doesn't need

05:08.690 --> 05:11.479
exclusivity or much itinerary.

05:11.480 --> 05:16.849
I'd rather spend my days the
way residents actually live.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.909
This is something we have after
every meal, all the Maldivians.

05:20.910 --> 05:24.459
This is Areca nuts,
this is betel leafs.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.649
Can I make one for you?

05:25.650 --> 05:26.320
Yeah.

05:26.321 --> 05:29.019
So you're making me a leaf taco.

05:29.020 --> 05:31.509
It's better to learn
through hands on experience

05:31.510 --> 05:34.199
even if there's some
trial and error.

05:34.200 --> 05:34.790
Good?

05:34.790 --> 05:35.450
No.

05:35.451 --> 05:38.799
How's the betel leaf taste?

05:38.800 --> 05:41.179
True to form, does
the intended effect.

05:41.180 --> 05:44.921
It's like I get an easy
feeling, high feel.

05:44.922 --> 05:46.629
I think I know what
you're talking about.

05:46.630 --> 05:49.839
Like I just had four cigarettes
at once or something.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.949
You want some more?

05:50.950 --> 05:51.640
No, we're good.

05:51.641 --> 05:53.679
I think that was
the right amount.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.619
So some customs I wasn't
the biggest fan of,

05:56.620 --> 05:58.779
but what was most important
is that the more time

05:58.780 --> 06:01.539
I spent with Kevin the more
traditions I would learn

06:01.540 --> 06:03.279
and people I would meet.

06:03.280 --> 06:08.019
Kevin kind of knows everyone,
which was paramount for where

06:08.020 --> 06:12.519
we were going next, one of the
most densely populated cities

06:12.520 --> 06:18.459
in the world, Malé.

06:18.460 --> 06:21.339
Every place has its
own unique speed

06:21.340 --> 06:24.519
and you must adapt
quickly to thrive.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.129
Almost half of the population
here packed the capital city

06:27.130 --> 06:30.639
of Malé for access to trade
and a sense of security from

06:30.640 --> 06:32.409
the elements.

06:32.410 --> 06:35.729
Everything in this metropolis
is constantly changing.

06:35.730 --> 06:38.869
There's reverence for the
old, a sense of history,

06:38.870 --> 06:42.859
but the attitude of Malé
is in perpetual motion.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.469
There's a bustling
fish market where

06:44.470 --> 06:46.659
daily catches with
the freshest tuna

06:46.660 --> 06:51.069
feed both the locals and the
resorts, and traffic on water

06:51.070 --> 06:53.299
rivals that on land.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.719
In the heart of Malé, Kevin
runs a women's boutique.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.109
We swing by as I'm getting my
bearings in the neighborhood.

07:00.110 --> 07:02.499
He started the business
basically from nothing,

07:02.500 --> 07:04.539
one of the few
successful entrepreneurs

07:04.540 --> 07:07.359
in a country that is mainly
motivated by the hospitality

07:07.360 --> 07:08.170
industry.

07:08.171 --> 07:13.509
After my studies I came back
to Malé and it was difficult

07:13.510 --> 07:17.529
for me to get a job so I thought
I wouldn't work for somebody,

07:17.530 --> 07:19.659
I'll start up my own business.

07:19.660 --> 07:24.549
I got a loan and today I'm
here just smiling, happy.

07:24.550 --> 07:26.529
It's clear that Kevin's
ability to make friends

07:26.530 --> 07:29.079
anywhere and everywhere
has been a good part

07:29.080 --> 07:30.879
of the success of his business.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.399
So we know you already
as the mayor of Malé.

07:34.400 --> 07:38.559
Could you just speak to being
this friendly tour de force?

07:38.560 --> 07:42.479
If someone, like, introduced
me or if I meet somebody

07:42.480 --> 07:44.599
I just keep the
friendship, always.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.929
I just go and say hello.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.119
Always I do that.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.729
So do most people in Malé just
have their own little bachelor

07:50.730 --> 07:52.289
pad, or how's that work out?

07:52.290 --> 07:53.449
Bachelor?

07:53.450 --> 07:54.430
No, no.

07:54.431 --> 07:57.779
Most of the people
live with their families.

07:57.780 --> 08:01.749
I'm still living with my
parents because I just

08:01.750 --> 08:03.649
don't want to leave them.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.089
They gave me the love
and care and everything.

08:07.090 --> 08:09.849
Maybe when I get married
I might have to go,

08:09.850 --> 08:12.459
but I just want to be with them.

08:12.460 --> 08:14.769
Suddenly I felt like
I had to call my mom.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.779
My parents are
really cool parents.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.889
My mom was a runner.

08:17.890 --> 08:19.506
She was a great athlete.

08:19.507 --> 08:20.589
How far is it around Malé?

08:20.590 --> 08:21.240
5k.

08:21.240 --> 08:21.830
5k?

08:21.830 --> 08:22.750
But you run marathons.

08:22.751 --> 08:24.082
So how many laps do you got to...

08:24.083 --> 08:25.509
It's 8 and 1/2.

08:25.510 --> 08:27.759
Go for a run with me?

08:27.760 --> 08:30.259
Not going to run the marathon
with you, but I'll take a lap.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.068
Just a 5k.

08:32.070 --> 08:34.889
Let's do it.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.139
There seem to be two
worlds in the Maldives,

08:37.140 --> 08:40.619
one for resort patrons
and one for residents.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.739
I could have easily spent my
entire trip like most visitors

08:43.740 --> 08:47.589
without seeing any local culture
or meeting any new people.

08:47.590 --> 08:50.279
Kevin provided me a genuine
look at the Maldives.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.179
But I was still a
novice to this world

08:52.180 --> 08:54.869
and had no idea how deep
things were going to get

08:54.870 --> 08:57.009
or the heroes I would meet.

08:57.010 --> 08:59.399
The rest of my journey
would start tomorrow

08:59.400 --> 09:00.450
with a man named Funko.

09:05.990 --> 09:07.629
The next day I
synced up with Funko,

09:07.630 --> 09:10.579
a photographer that takes high
fashion stills and produces

09:10.580 --> 09:12.379
street art around Malé.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.954
He's a hard man to
track down, kind

09:13.955 --> 09:17.179
of the Banksy of the Maldives.
Funko's unique vantage

09:17.180 --> 09:19.399
point on local
culture and style has

09:19.400 --> 09:21.500
led him to collaborate
with a new partner.

09:24.650 --> 09:27.469
I created this
little person Mika.

09:27.470 --> 09:30.529
Mika is sort of like
a goodwill ambassador.

09:30.530 --> 09:33.409
He's able to make a little
statement very boldly,

09:33.410 --> 09:34.759
and people would listen to it.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.639
Why do you think they listened
to a cobbled together toy?

09:37.640 --> 09:40.279
If I went out there
with a placard and say,

09:40.280 --> 09:43.269
hey, don't throw garbage,
they'll be like, hey, boo,

09:43.270 --> 09:44.260
get out of here.

09:44.261 --> 09:46.519
But when I take
Mika out he doesn't

09:46.520 --> 09:50.089
look threatening or
intimidating or serious, you know?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.109
He's a cute little fellow
...And he doesn't blink

09:51.110 --> 09:52.775
...with goofy eyes and
they're like yeah,

09:52.776 --> 09:54.709
okay, we like you, Mika.

09:54.710 --> 09:57.229
Mika may be a cute doll,
but he has made waves

09:57.230 --> 09:59.539
as a stark reminder
of current issues,

09:59.540 --> 10:02.029
and thousands are tuning
into his adventures.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.209
He even found a girl.

10:03.210 --> 10:06.069
So that's him on a
bike with his girl.

10:06.070 --> 10:06.750
She's cute.

10:06.751 --> 10:08.049
Yeah, she's cute.

10:08.050 --> 10:10.359
That was during the
political uprising.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.009
So he's waiting for the
commissioner of police.

10:13.010 --> 10:15.109
He was the first person
to protest that day.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.979
A lot of Maldivians
are protesting.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.619
And he was the first person.

10:18.620 --> 10:22.039
While Mika has developed a huge
underground following in Malé,

10:22.040 --> 10:24.709
he's not quite as popular
with the authorities.

10:24.710 --> 10:28.279
And because of that, Funko
tends to keep a low profile.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.679
A little guy like this
isn't so intimidating,

10:30.680 --> 10:32.485
but they may not be
the biggest fan of you.

10:32.486 --> 10:34.609
How has that affected the
way you live around here?

10:34.610 --> 10:38.609
For me more than politics, it's
about the environment here.

10:38.610 --> 10:40.669
And why I'm in hiding
is because if I

10:40.670 --> 10:43.529
touch upon the controversial
issues and stuff,

10:43.530 --> 10:47.349
there are people out there who
would just want to harm me.

10:47.350 --> 10:48.769
It sounds like he
speaks for you.

10:48.770 --> 10:51.859
He speaks for me and
the people that really

10:51.860 --> 10:53.689
does care about the ocean.

10:53.690 --> 10:54.829
I really love the ocean.

10:54.830 --> 10:56.629
I tell these people
out here, if you

10:56.630 --> 10:59.009
go underwater it's a
different world out there.

10:59.010 --> 11:00.119
It's beautiful.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.989
I've never been diving,
but I think I got to here.

11:02.990 --> 11:03.970
You got to.

11:03.971 --> 11:06.769
Funko had a mission for
me, a quest of sorts.

11:06.770 --> 11:09.499
Later in the trip he'd take
me on a dive to investigate

11:09.500 --> 11:11.919
an unseen and
undocumented danger,

11:11.920 --> 11:13.879
a crack in Malé's coral reef.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.579
But in the meantime, Funko
suggested a few other places

11:16.580 --> 11:17.939
to investigate.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.179
So you should definitely
visit Soneva Fushi.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.519
Waste management
is top class there.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.829
It's an example to
the whole of Maldives.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.299
They even have this little
swimming camp for students

11:27.300 --> 11:28.006
out there.

11:28.007 --> 11:30.379
We are surrounded by the ocean
and there are still people

11:30.380 --> 11:31.859
who don't know how to swim.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.699
I don't think anyone has gone
there and highlighted that.

11:34.700 --> 11:38.179
I decided to take Funko's advice
and visit Soneva Fushi, an

11:38.180 --> 11:39.679
Eco-resort in the north.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.960
But before leaving Malé, Kevin
introduced me to one more local

11:42.961 --> 11:43.460
artist.

11:43.461 --> 11:46.953
(MALDIVIAN SINGING)

12:04.450 --> 12:09.424
Thank you for participating in
the first tiny swingset concert

12:09.425 --> 12:11.139
series.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.409
Thank you for having me.

12:12.410 --> 12:15.129
Can you describe the dynamic
of being a musician in Malé?

12:15.130 --> 12:19.049
A lot of the motivating artists
today, they're based in Malé,

12:19.050 --> 12:20.789
though very few girls.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.459
Everyone's very friendly.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.779
We actually have a chance to
get together and jam a lot.

12:25.780 --> 12:27.459
So if I have
something that I want

12:27.460 --> 12:29.859
them to hear I can
just go play to them

12:29.860 --> 12:32.019
and they'll be like
"yeah, that's really good."

12:32.020 --> 12:34.329
Everyone's just feeding
off the other one, you know?

12:34.330 --> 12:37.606
(MALDIVIAN SINGING)

12:40.882 --> 12:42.589
That music really
chilled me out.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.749
I'm curious what it
means in Maldivian.

12:44.750 --> 12:49.459
It starts out as,
(SPEAKING MALDIVIAN) saying

12:49.460 --> 12:51.409
like, look at how
beautiful this is.

12:51.410 --> 12:53.881
When you hear this song
you get goosebumps.

12:53.882 --> 12:56.089
I think it's the best part
about Maldives, the ocean,

12:56.090 --> 12:57.499
you get all these colors.

12:57.500 --> 13:01.009
You can get a deep blue
color and then a light blue

13:01.010 --> 13:02.869
and then so beautiful.

13:02.870 --> 13:05.860
(MALDIVIAN SINGING)

13:08.160 --> 13:12.959
As I sailed up to Soneva Fushi,
Anya's lyrics resonated deeply.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.769
The bathtub warm water
had the most uncanny hues.

13:16.770 --> 13:18.069
I had to take a dip.

13:18.070 --> 13:21.899
But first I need to know how
Soneva Fushi could go green

13:21.900 --> 13:24.066
and still live the good life.

13:24.067 --> 13:25.649
Our intentions and our
philosophy allows

13:25.650 --> 13:30.129
us to really make sustainability
and luxury partners.

13:30.130 --> 13:33.419
We need to give people the
luxury of the sports car,

13:33.420 --> 13:35.309
but in a much more
Eco-friendly way.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.019
If things don't
change, the Maldives

13:37.020 --> 13:39.389
may well find itself underwater.

13:39.390 --> 13:40.679
Businesses have to solve it.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.449
Governments create
the context, but it's

13:42.450 --> 13:44.679
businesses who caused the
problem in the first place

13:44.680 --> 13:46.169
and we have to change the world.

13:46.170 --> 13:49.079
We need to give consumers
sustainable options

13:49.080 --> 13:50.759
without compromises.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.669
And it didn't take long
to find out that Soneva

13:53.670 --> 13:54.759
wasn't compromising.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.159
Yeah, okay, this is nice.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.389
We got the swimming pool,
but we can just walk right

14:00.390 --> 14:02.595
into the Corona commercial.

14:02.596 --> 14:03.720
Well, we got to get inside.

14:07.190 --> 14:10.529
That's the espresso
machine, into the bathroom.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.299
Welcome, please.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.140
This is insane.

14:18.080 --> 14:22.329
This is where great
novels are written.

14:22.330 --> 14:25.339
I've never been to an Eco resort
before, but it's pretty cool.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.719
And Soneva's doing it right
for the environment and soul.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.239
Let's see how they
provide all this.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.559
I hopped on a bike to get a full
tour with Gordon Jackson, Waste

14:34.560 --> 14:36.889
to Wealth Manager
at Soneva Fushi.

14:36.890 --> 14:38.559
So we're going to
go to Eco-Centro.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.429
So looking at how we can
responsibly manage our waste.

14:41.430 --> 14:42.819
That goal that we
have is to show

14:42.820 --> 14:45.159
that there's a link between
environmental sustainability

14:45.160 --> 14:47.174
and financial good sense.

14:47.175 --> 14:47.800
So here we are.

14:47.801 --> 14:48.849
This is Eco Centro.

14:48.850 --> 14:49.899
Fantastic.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.329
We receive somewhere between
50 and 100 of these boxes

14:52.330 --> 14:52.960
every week.

14:52.961 --> 14:54.279
We got a number of
ideas how to use them.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.109
What we do at the
moment is we collect up

14:56.110 --> 14:57.359
the individual panels.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.079
We use them as
insulation on new villas.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.439
We are looking to invest in a
machine that will shred this up

15:02.440 --> 15:05.271
into a powder that could then
be mixed in with a concrete mix.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.479
There is no shortage of this
material in the country.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.940
There's a lot of
building going on.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.439
These are the kind of things
we're trying to pioneer and see

15:11.440 --> 15:12.196
what works.

15:12.197 --> 15:14.069
These actually have come
from another resort.

15:14.070 --> 15:15.523
You're welcoming the waste.

15:15.524 --> 15:18.189
If it's the right kind of waste,
if it's what we're looking for.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.619
We'll be bringing a glass
artist to come and make

15:20.620 --> 15:23.619
utensils for the kitchen,
art pieces, and other things.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.119
So you're taking
on leftover glass

15:25.120 --> 15:27.109
from all the other
islands and then you

15:27.110 --> 15:29.749
make Chihuly sort of
art work out of it.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.059
It's pretty wild.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.889
Behind us, this is
our composting area.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.149
Each pile represents a week.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.189
What was a mixture of
woodchips and food waste

15:36.190 --> 15:38.229
is now good dirt.

15:38.230 --> 15:38.980
Exactly.

15:38.981 --> 15:42.639
When I hear "Eco" and "sustainable"
I think a lot of people

15:42.640 --> 15:44.889
immediately have this
stigma of roughing it,

15:44.890 --> 15:48.999
or that this is just something
very crunchy and hippie

15:49.000 --> 15:51.309
and you would not
be able to enjoy

15:51.310 --> 15:53.019
the same level of comfort.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.129
You have to compromise.

15:54.130 --> 15:56.059
As part of the
Waste to Wealth concept,

15:56.060 --> 15:57.519
it's important not
just because we

15:57.520 --> 15:59.143
want to be environmentally
responsible,

15:59.144 --> 16:01.609
but we want to show that it
makes financial sense as well.

16:01.610 --> 16:04.279
We are now turning the waste
to our department, which

16:04.280 --> 16:06.339
increases Eco Centro
in the gardens

16:06.340 --> 16:08.329
into a profit center
instead of a cost.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.959
And by showing this
to local schoolchildren

16:10.960 --> 16:13.420
or local counselors of
our neighboring islands

16:13.421 --> 16:14.919
we have an opportunity
to share that

16:14.920 --> 16:17.349
with folks that can develop
them further elsewhere.

16:17.350 --> 16:20.409
Perhaps most important about
Soneva's conscious capitalism

16:20.410 --> 16:22.929
is that they don't feel
proprietary and encourage

16:22.930 --> 16:24.205
others to copy their tactics.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.379
There is more to learn here,
but the swim class Funko

16:29.380 --> 16:31.509
told me about had
just made port.

16:31.510 --> 16:35.219
So I dropped in to meet Ish,
one of the lead instructors.

16:35.220 --> 16:38.829
Ish is passionate about
working with Maldivian youth.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.289
The irony is not lost on
her that in a country that

16:41.290 --> 16:44.199
is literally sinking,
most of the children

16:44.200 --> 16:46.129
don't know how to swim.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.619
I got a chance to
sit down with her

16:47.620 --> 16:50.199
and hear about how the ocean
connects to the Maldivian

16:50.200 --> 16:51.759
identity.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.069
My mom tried to keep
me away from the ocean

16:54.070 --> 16:56.229
so much when I was younger.

16:56.230 --> 16:59.559
But I remember this one
day I couldn't swim then,

16:59.560 --> 17:02.829
but I had a life jacket
on and I went under

17:02.830 --> 17:05.269
and I saw the octopuses
and the corals

17:05.270 --> 17:07.959
and I just knew I had to learn.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.939
And so that's how
my journey started.

17:09.940 --> 17:12.867
Why is it important to
teach these local children

17:12.868 --> 17:13.929
this skill?

17:13.930 --> 17:15.969
Not only is it a
survival technique,

17:15.970 --> 17:19.529
but once they actually
get to be in the water,

17:19.530 --> 17:21.209
once they're comfortable
in the water,

17:21.210 --> 17:23.858
once they're not scared of the
water, once they see what's

17:23.858 --> 17:26.617
underneath, all the
beauty, then they

17:26.618 --> 17:28.259
kind of want to protect it.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.219
And we're hoping to
now share that spirit,

17:30.220 --> 17:32.169
make them ocean stewards.

17:32.170 --> 17:35.649
Why is it important that we
protect these oceans here?

17:35.650 --> 17:37.999
Because we wouldn't
be here without it.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.839
If they're giving back to us, we
should be giving back to them.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.259
And I want the
generations that come

17:44.260 --> 17:48.729
after us to realize this was
known as paradise for a reason.

17:48.730 --> 17:54.099
Can you talk about how the water
and the people of the Maldives

17:54.100 --> 17:55.996
have a relationship?

17:55.997 --> 17:57.579
I remember a friend
of mine telling me

17:57.580 --> 17:59.199
about how her
grandmother actually

17:59.200 --> 18:02.809
walked across these islands
to get to her grandpa.

18:02.810 --> 18:08.329
So star-crossed lovers, we swam
across the sea for each other.

18:08.330 --> 18:11.839
I take much pride for being
born in such a wonderful place,

18:11.840 --> 18:16.459
but the truth is we're living
in such a delicate environment.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.919
Our biggest threat
will be the ocean.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.413
(MUSIC PLAYING)

19:18.301 --> 19:21.889
The ocean was enchanting.

19:21.890 --> 19:23.929
I could forget how
the future hinges

19:23.930 --> 19:29.239
on such a contrasting force,
a threat so beautiful,

19:29.240 --> 19:31.714
a relentless power that
could not be tamed.

19:31.715 --> 19:35.180
(MUSIC PLAYING)

19:56.020 --> 19:58.249
I could have stayed at
Soneva Fushi longer,

19:58.250 --> 20:00.899
but it was about time I
met up with Kevin again.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.699
We had a lot to catch up on.

20:02.700 --> 20:05.369
I shared with him my
experience with Ish and Gordon.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.619
He clued me into the
latest with his business

20:07.620 --> 20:10.159
and some adventures he
had in store for us.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.209
We were heading north to
the more remote islands

20:12.210 --> 20:17.949
in the Maldives, and at sunset
we were going night fishing.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.949
Our boat captain was a grizzled
veteran of the open waters

20:20.950 --> 20:23.709
and spent most of his life
as a fisherman, who struck me

20:23.710 --> 20:25.629
as a no bullshit tough guy.

20:25.630 --> 20:28.059
Tonight would be my
first time fishing,

20:28.060 --> 20:29.529
but we hit it off quickly.

20:29.530 --> 20:32.259
And before long I was
steering the boat.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.649
Fishing is one of the
most fundamental skills

20:34.650 --> 20:36.309
in the Maldives.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.879
Give any local a milk
jug and some fishing reel

20:38.880 --> 20:41.649
and they'll have you
a catch in no time.

20:41.650 --> 20:45.709
It's deeply embedded in the
national identity and economy.

20:45.710 --> 20:47.259
It's also a great
chance to drink

20:47.260 --> 20:49.109
in the beauty of the open water.

20:49.110 --> 20:52.484
(MUSIC PLAYING)

20:54.900 --> 20:58.829
Our captain gave us
a quick crash course.

20:58.830 --> 21:00.149
There it is.

21:00.150 --> 21:02.539
And you just let it keep going
until it hits the bottom.

21:02.540 --> 21:03.789
I shouldn't have shaved today.

21:03.790 --> 21:08.148
I should have got small
goatee, an eyepatch.

21:08.149 --> 21:09.689
No one on the boat
was surprised when

21:09.690 --> 21:13.319
he reeled in that first fish,
but as nightfall set in Kevin

21:13.320 --> 21:14.763
and I were catching up.

21:14.764 --> 21:15.264
Yay.

21:20.302 --> 21:21.659
Good.

21:21.660 --> 21:22.770
All right, take her.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.619
I like it.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.709
I had held my own, catching
jackfish and snapper,

21:30.710 --> 21:32.419
and it felt like a
milestone to partake

21:32.420 --> 21:36.319
in a truly authentic
Maldivian fishing expedition.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.909
But the night was young.

21:37.910 --> 21:42.079
No outing like this is complete
without a beachside barbecue.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.779
Our catch of the day was
rubbed in curry spices

21:44.780 --> 21:47.809
and cooked over coconut shells,
giving it that distinctly

21:47.810 --> 21:49.519
Maldivian flavor.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.879
And of course the Boduberu
was about to begin.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.559
What's Boduberu?

21:54.560 --> 21:55.250
Let's find out.

21:55.251 --> 21:58.708
(PLAYING DRUMS)

22:39.280 --> 22:59.459
(SPEAKING MALDIVIAN)

22:59.460 --> 23:02.890
(PLAYING DRUMS)

23:22.040 --> 23:47.039
(SPEAKING MALDIVIAN)

23:47.040 --> 23:50.512
(PLAYING DRUMS)

24:28.208 --> 24:31.680
(APPLAUSE)

24:34.930 --> 24:41.219
Yeah, that was cool.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.615
(PLAYING DRUMS)

24:54.810 --> 24:56.939
We continued to bounce
from island to island.

24:56.940 --> 25:00.259
And of course as long as I stuck
with Kevin, I made fast friends.

25:00.260 --> 25:03.466
(LAUGHTER)

25:08.300 --> 25:11.299
There was an undeniable
charm to the smaller, more

25:11.300 --> 25:13.519
remote communities in the north.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.199
Each island seemed to
be its own little world.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.799
The people were welcoming
and the pace of life

25:18.800 --> 25:22.349
was slower, much slower.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.759
Family is the most
precious thing

25:24.760 --> 25:27.629
and most activities
are centered around it.

25:27.630 --> 25:29.429
Many locals
specialize in a craft

25:29.430 --> 25:32.529
that been passed down from
one generation to the next.

25:32.530 --> 25:35.699
Whether it's fishing,
weaving or wood carving,

25:35.700 --> 25:37.980
traditions are the fabric
of life on these islands.

25:40.764 --> 26:08.139
(SPEAKING MALDIVIAN)

26:08.140 --> 26:43.889
(SPEAKING MALDIVIAN)

26:43.890 --> 27:10.169
(SPEAKING MALDIVIAN)

27:10.170 --> 27:13.670
(MUSIC PLAYING)

27:20.170 --> 27:24.009
These remote places most locals
will not even make it to.

27:24.010 --> 27:27.549
This whole leg of the trek
was captivating, surreal,

27:27.550 --> 27:30.209
but it was time to
get back to Malé.

27:30.210 --> 27:34.029
Funko had contacted us and was
ready to take us on that dive.

27:34.030 --> 27:35.849
I had to get back.

27:35.850 --> 27:37.559
But what we had
seen in the north,

27:37.560 --> 27:41.389
this lifestyle, hadn't
changed in a long time

27:41.390 --> 27:45.499
and wasn't planning on changing
for anyone or anything.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.709
If this is in fact
modern Atlantis,

27:48.710 --> 27:50.749
time will tell what
Maldivian traditions

27:50.750 --> 27:52.849
can be retained if
forced to migrate

27:52.850 --> 27:56.069
to another part of the world.

27:56.070 --> 27:58.639
The next morning,
we set out for Malé.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.669
Kevin's open water road trip
felt like endless summer,

28:01.670 --> 28:04.049
and he had one last
surprise detour.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.429
We were making a pit stop
at an uninhabited island.

28:07.430 --> 28:10.639
The water was as vibrant as
it was back at Soneva Fushi

28:10.640 --> 28:12.679
and there wasn't
another soul in sight.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.439
Before long you're crab
hunting on the beach.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.136
Arm deep in crabs right here.

28:18.137 --> 28:19.969
Are you worried about
getting your hand bit?

28:19.970 --> 28:20.953
I don't care.

28:20.954 --> 28:24.579
Ow!

28:24.580 --> 28:25.839
Huge, huge.

28:25.840 --> 28:26.786
Wow.

28:26.787 --> 28:28.699
(SPEAKING MALDIVIAN)

28:28.700 --> 28:30.339
That won't bite.

28:30.340 --> 28:33.149
Oh, God.

28:33.150 --> 28:34.439
Whoa.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.648
It happened very much like
the crustacean itself.

28:37.649 --> 28:38.440
We'll let him back.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.799
But just when I thought
we had found an oasis,

28:47.800 --> 28:49.231
something wasn't quite right.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.369
This is the most pristine
beach I've ever seen.

28:54.370 --> 28:58.029
We're playing with crabs
and then everywhere

28:58.030 --> 29:05.259
is trash, bottles cans,
diapers, yummo. Bottled water,

29:05.260 --> 29:06.919
plastic cups.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.603
It was a jarring end
to our private getaway.

29:09.604 --> 29:11.769
It got me wondering, what
happens to all the garbage

29:11.770 --> 29:15.789
in a country that only imports
from the outside world?

29:15.790 --> 29:18.309
Kevin explained that all
the trash in the Maldives

29:18.310 --> 29:21.538
goes to a place creatively
nicknamed Trash Island.

29:21.539 --> 29:23.079
It didn't sound like
one of the spots

29:23.080 --> 29:24.879
they put on the postcards.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.289
I asked if we could go there.

29:26.290 --> 29:28.009
He thought Ish might be of help.

29:28.010 --> 29:31.569
So it was onwards to Malé
to reunite with our friends

29:31.570 --> 29:33.549
and climb a flaming
mountain of trash.

29:33.550 --> 29:36.700
(MUSIC PLAYING)

29:41.990 --> 29:44.999
Back in Malé we picked up Ish,
the swim instructor from Soneva

29:45.000 --> 29:46.219
Fushi.

29:46.220 --> 29:49.459
Trash Island was off limits,
but Ish arranged safe passage

29:49.460 --> 29:52.649
with the help of the only folks
who recycle in the nation.

29:52.650 --> 29:55.789
I feel like we're on one
on those nice safari tours,

29:55.790 --> 29:57.799
but instead of rhinos
or elephants,

29:57.800 --> 30:00.560
we got mounds of flaming trash.

30:03.940 --> 30:07.029
Somehow by choice we
transported ourselves

30:07.030 --> 30:10.119
from some of the most
gorgeous islands on earth

30:10.120 --> 30:12.259
to a scene out of
Apocalypse Now.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.495
So dystopian.

30:13.496 --> 30:14.619
Yeah, this is a hell scape.

30:14.620 --> 30:17.549
This is what Mad Max
wishes it could be.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.659
Do you remember the
Brave Little Toaster?

30:19.660 --> 30:20.999
It's kind of like that here.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.279
I am the blanket,
you are the toaster.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.358
This island now has the
highest peak in the Maldives.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.899
Probably not where
you want to set up

30:28.900 --> 30:31.069
camp when sea levels rise.

30:31.070 --> 30:33.069
But we decided to
climb to the top

30:33.070 --> 30:34.877
and set off in that direction.

30:40.610 --> 30:43.239
Fun.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.220
Ew.

30:44.220 --> 30:45.220
Wet, yucky.

30:45.220 --> 30:45.820
No.

30:45.821 --> 30:47.380
No more, no more fun.

30:50.470 --> 30:52.059
You're scared off easily.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.859
Scared off?

30:53.860 --> 30:56.969
Just trash juice, I just
don't like trash juice.

30:56.970 --> 31:00.549
Oh, I mean, it's a
nice fixer upper.

31:00.550 --> 31:02.168
Lot of space.

31:02.169 --> 31:03.209
You want to get up there?

31:03.210 --> 31:05.279
This is one of those
places where you can just

31:05.280 --> 31:06.899
get lost exploring.

31:06.900 --> 31:10.319
And then of course you choke
to death on all the fumes.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.619
On that note we decided we
could go antiquing another day.

31:13.620 --> 31:16.550
Yeah, this is the End
of Days right here.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.564
You're a brave soul for
joining us on this adventure,

31:23.565 --> 31:24.231
let me tell you.

31:24.232 --> 31:26.269
Oh, this is nothing for me.

31:26.270 --> 31:29.379
This is the kind of
adventures I like to have.

31:29.380 --> 31:32.159
Oh, look, flames, beautiful.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.169
Let's try not to step
on anything that burns.

31:35.170 --> 31:36.669
Yeah, don't breathe too hard.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.259
Don't step too hard.

31:38.260 --> 31:42.839
I'm surprised my sandals
have made it this far.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.339
We were picking up trash on one
of these uninhabited islands

31:45.340 --> 31:48.273
and it was some people
would say feudal.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.689
No one's going to
see us doing it.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.064
We picked up a couple of bags,
put it near the trash can.

31:52.065 --> 31:53.819
But who knows where
that's even going.

31:53.820 --> 31:57.249
I actually have a
story about that.

31:57.250 --> 32:01.339
This one time a man was
walking along the beach,

32:01.340 --> 32:04.459
there was a lot of starfish's
that had washed onto the shore

32:04.460 --> 32:08.029
and he was just picking up one
and throwing it into the sea.

32:08.030 --> 32:11.811
And somebody sees him doing
it comes and asks him,

32:11.812 --> 32:13.269
why do you think
you're doing that?

32:13.270 --> 32:14.935
Even if you spend the
whole day doing it

32:14.936 --> 32:17.469
you're not going to be able
to save all the starfish.

32:17.470 --> 32:20.049
So he picks up a starfish,
throws it into the sea

32:20.050 --> 32:22.719
and goes, "it
mattered to that one.:

32:22.720 --> 32:26.799
And that's my belief
with cleaning trash.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.299
Ish is not the kind
of person who's

32:28.300 --> 32:30.309
afraid to get her hands dirty.

32:30.310 --> 32:32.319
And she works closely
with Secure Bag,

32:32.320 --> 32:35.139
the same organization that
helps Soneva Fushi turn

32:35.140 --> 32:36.879
their waste into wealth.

32:36.880 --> 32:37.840
That's one week?

32:37.841 --> 32:40.079
30 tons for the (INAUDIBLE).

32:40.080 --> 32:41.949
They compact it
elsewhere, bring it here,

32:41.950 --> 32:43.899
and this is ready for export.

32:43.900 --> 32:46.729
Secure Bag is finding ways
to repurpose and profit

32:46.730 --> 32:47.988
from other people's crap.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.449
It may be a drop in the
bucket, but it's certainly

32:53.450 --> 32:55.019
better than burning the bucket.

32:55.020 --> 32:58.209
I think we had over
900 boxes of this.

32:58.210 --> 32:58.800
At Soneva?

32:58.800 --> 32:59.505
At Soneva.

32:59.506 --> 33:01.549
Secure Bag help
take it all the way.

33:01.550 --> 33:05.479
All this junk can
actually be a business.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.929
Secure Bag can identify that
why not evangelize sort of field

33:08.930 --> 33:12.529
teams where people can do
this in their neighborhood

33:12.530 --> 33:15.529
and work directly with them,
make a small bit of profit

33:15.530 --> 33:17.789
so that they can continue
what they're doing.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.159
It's just a strategy
where everyone benefits.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.329
Ish is just doing just that,
organizing trash pickups in her

33:23.330 --> 33:24.290
community in Malé.

33:24.291 --> 33:27.089
Even got approached by
a bunch of scuba divers.

33:27.090 --> 33:29.479
I would like to help by
cleaning in the city.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.009
Do you think that
those divers might

33:31.010 --> 33:34.879
want to meet with us when
me and Funko were thinking

33:34.880 --> 33:36.119
about checking out that reef?

33:36.120 --> 33:37.040
Yeah, I think so.

33:37.041 --> 33:41.149
Funko just sent us an email
asking me to set that up.

33:41.150 --> 33:43.039
Good man.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.139
What Ish she had showed
me at Trash Island,

33:45.140 --> 33:48.489
is that every little
thing you do does matter,

33:48.490 --> 33:51.919
and what drives people like Ish
and Funko to make a difference

33:51.920 --> 33:55.639
and inspire people is their love
of the ocean and all the beauty

33:55.640 --> 33:57.969
that makes up the Maldives.

33:57.970 --> 34:00.309
Even if it is inevitable
that the sea levels will

34:00.310 --> 34:02.929
rise above the Maldives
in our lifetime,

34:02.930 --> 34:05.349
Ish and Funko will
dedicate themselves

34:05.350 --> 34:09.688
to do whatever they can to
stop that from happening.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.908
Funko has been working to
call attention to a crack

34:11.909 --> 34:13.559
in the reef near Malé.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.447
He's been talking with
local scuba divers

34:15.449 --> 34:18.299
to find the exact location
of this damaged reef.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.270
What does this mean?

34:19.271 --> 34:21.018
What does a crack
in the reef mean?

34:21.020 --> 34:23.838
The risk of collapse.

34:23.839 --> 34:25.129
With the landslide under water.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.248
And the landslide.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.399
And the reef is what
protects Malé from...

34:28.400 --> 34:29.150
All the islands.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.447
All the islands.

34:30.449 --> 34:32.619
A healthy coral reef
provides a key layer

34:32.620 --> 34:34.708
of protection against
rising sea levels

34:34.710 --> 34:36.739
and can dramatically
reduce land erosion.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.789
Zaheena is a local
journalist who

34:41.790 --> 34:44.487
also wanted to document
this erosion in the reef.

34:44.489 --> 34:47.217
Zaheena has a lot more
experience scuba diving

34:47.219 --> 34:49.518
and doesn't seem to
shy from a good story.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.888
A real mensch named Funko talked
about this crack in the reef

34:52.889 --> 34:54.089
right here in Malé.

34:54.090 --> 34:55.498
What's the significance?

34:55.500 --> 34:58.769
More and more we're seeing
harbors being dredged.

34:58.770 --> 35:01.769
We see a lot of development
that doesn't really

35:01.770 --> 35:04.949
think about what impact it
could have on the reefs.

35:04.950 --> 35:09.216
Who knows, like Malé could
be cracking from its weight

35:09.217 --> 35:11.549
beneath us and we don't know
because we don't keep track

35:11.550 --> 35:13.529
of these things.

35:13.530 --> 35:16.709
Our mission was clear, the
crack threatened the entire city

35:16.710 --> 35:17.610
of Malé.

35:17.611 --> 35:20.699
It was time to assemble
the Maldivian Avengers.

35:20.700 --> 35:23.279
So we have a whole
convoy joining us.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.298
We got the guys who
discovered the crack.

35:25.299 --> 35:26.339
We'll be the ones diving.

35:26.340 --> 35:26.940
Is Ish coming?

35:26.940 --> 35:27.620
Ish is coming.

35:27.620 --> 35:28.620
She's not going to dive.

35:28.621 --> 35:30.389
She's going to hang
with Funko up top.

35:30.390 --> 35:33.929
He's never been there
before and it's not exactly

35:33.930 --> 35:35.039
easy to the untrained eye.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.189
So we're actually going to
get to use that Open ROV.

35:38.190 --> 35:40.579
Apparently it's not exactly
easy to identify the cracks

35:40.580 --> 35:42.779
so we're going to need
some trial and error.

35:42.780 --> 35:44.819
And it's got lots of
currents in the area.

35:44.820 --> 35:46.429
Also a lot of traffic.

35:46.430 --> 35:47.699
A lot of traffic?

35:47.700 --> 35:49.879
So boat traffic,
currents, don't know where

35:49.880 --> 35:51.129
this thing is, low visibility.

35:51.130 --> 35:52.349
It's a nice adventure.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.929
Nice adventure.

35:54.930 --> 35:57.339
Our quest was shaping up
to be something special.

35:57.340 --> 35:59.589
And I was going to get to
do it with all the friends

35:59.590 --> 36:02.919
I had met along my way.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.579
I think people are going to
see some really raw footage.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.059
I'm really excited for it.

36:07.060 --> 36:10.459
So first of all, we start
with the big overhang,

36:10.460 --> 36:12.874
and then after that,
straight away we

36:12.875 --> 36:14.289
will go to the broken area.

36:14.290 --> 36:16.719
We got ourselves a
robot that will help

36:16.720 --> 36:19.119
us find this crack under water.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.659
And you guys are the ones who
are going to be manning it.

36:22.660 --> 36:27.132

36:27.133 --> 36:30.612
(BOAT ENGINE SOUND)

36:36.576 --> 36:40.055
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

36:42.140 --> 36:45.431
We're getting some footage.

36:45.432 --> 36:46.348
Yeah, she's there.

36:46.349 --> 36:48.149
Yep, she's there.

36:48.150 --> 36:50.949
Zaheena's there.

36:50.950 --> 36:54.039
Once we equalized we swam
towards the damaged reef

36:54.040 --> 36:57.039
and immediately realized
that things were off.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.529
Compared to normal
healthy coral reef

36:59.530 --> 37:02.439
the terrain was
drab and lifeless.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.599
Our guide pointed
out areas that showed

37:04.600 --> 37:06.879
signs of landslide
debris and did what he

37:06.880 --> 37:09.009
could to warn us to stay alert.

37:09.010 --> 37:11.589
This reef snapped in
two and others could

37:11.590 --> 37:12.910
break off and threaten us.

37:18.020 --> 37:21.269
We pressed on to the
reef nearest to the city,

37:21.270 --> 37:24.684
and as we did the current
picked up considerably.

37:24.685 --> 37:26.153
Trying to get some good footage.

37:26.154 --> 37:27.070
The current's really...

37:33.220 --> 37:36.099
The visibility is challenging,
but right now what

37:36.100 --> 37:38.259
you're looking at is
a significant crack

37:38.260 --> 37:40.479
in Malé's reef.

37:40.480 --> 37:44.679
The crack, the area is
completely dead actually.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.550
The reef is dead.

37:48.370 --> 37:50.019
Just as I tried to
direct the camera

37:50.020 --> 37:52.239
to get a closer
inspection of the crack,

37:52.240 --> 37:55.719
the current whipped up
into a frenzy and Zaheena

37:55.720 --> 37:56.909
was nowhere to be found.

37:56.910 --> 38:00.270
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

38:05.070 --> 38:08.014
It went well, actually,
except I lost my buoyancy

38:08.015 --> 38:10.129
and just shot up.

38:10.130 --> 38:11.459
That was not fun.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.599
So the Malé reef is
just really damaged.

38:13.600 --> 38:19.160
There's not a lot of coral
cover at all, very little fish.

38:19.161 --> 38:22.579
The crack is about this big
and then you kind of go down

38:22.580 --> 38:23.879
and it becomes bigger.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.949
I think it's brilliant
that we were able to take

38:26.950 --> 38:28.309
some footage of the reef crack.

38:28.310 --> 38:30.560
I don't think anyone has
brought this to light yet.

38:36.570 --> 38:39.219
Yeah, we saw the crack.

38:39.220 --> 38:41.779
It was deep.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.230
That current though, no joke.

38:48.150 --> 38:51.329
Killer currents and
missing persons, the dive

38:51.330 --> 38:53.939
had truly been an adventure.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.749
The feeling on the boat was
a friendship and deep pride

38:57.750 --> 38:59.939
that our mission
documented something core

38:59.940 --> 39:01.769
to the island's safety.

39:01.770 --> 39:04.619
It was a fitting
bookend to my trip.

39:04.620 --> 39:07.919
I dined under water, met
an inanimate activist

39:07.920 --> 39:12.789
making bold statements, listened
to the sounds of the Maldives,

39:12.790 --> 39:16.199
learned sustainability could
be good on the wallet, swam

39:16.200 --> 39:19.259
with the turtles, and
witnessed first hand a way

39:19.260 --> 39:23.349
of life unique to anything
I had seen before,

39:23.350 --> 39:27.460
and most importantly, we
fostered lifelong friendships.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.789
But I still had one
very important person

39:33.790 --> 39:38.379
to talk to, former president
Mohamed Nasheed, steward and UN

39:38.380 --> 39:40.809
representative of
all island nations,

39:40.810 --> 39:44.659
heralded by Time Magazine
as a leader and visionary,

39:44.660 --> 39:46.589
the Mandela of the Maldives.

39:46.590 --> 39:48.029
The science is sorted.

39:48.030 --> 39:48.950
It's proper.

39:48.951 --> 39:54.659
The sea level will rise, there's
no doubt about that at all.

39:54.660 --> 39:58.659
The sea levels will
probably rise over us,

39:58.660 --> 40:03.539
but we will find adaptation
measures as a society,

40:03.540 --> 40:06.209
as a culture, as a community.

40:06.210 --> 40:08.379
What still will be lost?

40:08.380 --> 40:10.529
What are some of those
uniquely Maldivian things

40:10.530 --> 40:11.238
that you cherish?

40:11.239 --> 40:14.189
My grandmother told
me, President, you

40:14.190 --> 40:16.799
can look at the
people, but they are

40:16.800 --> 40:19.809
the sounds and the
butterflies and the colors go.

40:19.810 --> 40:24.029
All of these islands aren't for
the inhabitants unique islands.

40:24.030 --> 40:27.429
There's nothing
like it for them.

40:27.430 --> 40:30.879
We have more than two billion,
the world's population living

40:30.880 --> 40:32.699
on coastal areas.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.679
We are not just simply
talking about the Maldives.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.319
Manhattan is as low
as the Maldives.

40:38.320 --> 40:41.679
And so for the people in
Malé or Manhattan or Miami,

40:41.680 --> 40:43.269
what can people do?

40:43.270 --> 40:47.549
This would become the
mainstream political discourse.

40:47.550 --> 40:49.539
And it's happening very rapidly.

40:49.540 --> 40:53.799
But the people have
a big responsibility

40:53.800 --> 40:56.139
in promoting this idea.

40:56.140 --> 41:01.489
Humanity, we've never had
the odds on our sides,

41:01.490 --> 41:05.059
and certainly in my life I've
never had the odds on my side.

41:05.060 --> 41:09.799
I get a death threat every day
from Islamic extremists because

41:09.800 --> 41:12.289
of my advocacy on environment.

41:12.290 --> 41:16.009
But there is hope and
we must not give up hope

41:16.010 --> 41:18.209
and we must move forward.

41:18.210 --> 41:20.449
We will probably stay
now because we are all

41:20.450 --> 41:24.929
human that's teared to the
brink and then pull back.

41:24.930 --> 41:29.809
We will stay to the
brink, and of course

41:29.810 --> 41:34.909
that has the sad side effect
of losing so much that you

41:34.910 --> 41:35.650
could have saved.

41:35.651 --> 41:39.045
(MUSIC PLAYING)

41:49.230 --> 41:51.329
I hope you agree what's
unique about this nation

41:51.330 --> 41:53.879
and culture is worth protecting.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.659
Their challenge is not unique,
the whole world faces it.

41:57.660 --> 41:59.909
They just have a front row seat.

41:59.910 --> 42:03.839
It's called climate change
and it's happening right now.

42:03.840 --> 42:08.039
It's compounding, demoralizing,
faceless, systemic,

42:08.040 --> 42:10.259
catastrophic, a life
changing problem

42:10.260 --> 42:14.429
that is not only not going
away, it's picking up steam.

42:14.430 --> 42:18.599
We can adapt and innovate and
foster a global environment

42:18.600 --> 42:21.509
that is ready to take on
this test of our generation.

42:21.510 --> 42:23.729
Join us and learn
about actions you

42:23.730 --> 42:26.569
can take to protect
the Maldives at home

42:26.570 --> 42:28.609
and change the story.
Because we know

42:28.610 --> 42:30.663
what the cost is of inaction:

42:30.664 --> 42:33.969
It's self-fulfilling prophecy.

42:33.970 --> 42:35.629
This is why we came
here to give you

42:35.630 --> 42:38.899
a first glimpse of the Maldives,
because we're damn sure we

42:38.900 --> 42:41.419
don't want it to be our last.

42:41.420 --> 42:43.519
Thanks for watching.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.870
