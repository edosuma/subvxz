-(buzz)
-Dammit!

00:02.917 --> 00:04.083
Brain freeze
is too hard.

00:04.166 --> 00:05.417
I knew I should have
gone for funny bone.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.291
Step aside.

00:08.917 --> 00:11.250
(J.D.) <i>One thing I've learned</i>
<i>is to never play operation</i>

00:11.333 --> 00:13.417
<i>against a surgeon for money.</i>

00:13.500 --> 00:14.750
(crack)

00:22.291 --> 00:23.959
Eight seconds.

00:24.041 --> 00:25.417
Is that a new record, baby?

00:25.500 --> 00:27.250
That depends.
What are we talking about?

00:27.333 --> 00:29.125
Haaaa.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.041
-Let's play again.
-No.

00:31.125 --> 00:33.333
Oh, come on. If you do, I promise
that every time I hit the buzzer,

00:33.417 --> 00:34.834
I'll act like I'm getting electrocuted.
Like this.

00:34.917 --> 00:36.792
(buzz)

00:36.875 --> 00:38.166
That's awesome, but no.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.125
My blood sugar's a little low.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.583
You want a cookie?

00:41.667 --> 00:44.458
(J.D.) <i>Turk's blood sugar was low</i>
<i>because he has type-two diabetes</i>

00:44.542 --> 00:46.500
<i>and hasn't figured out</i>
<i>his medication yet.</i>

00:46.583 --> 00:49.041
Mmm. Mulattos.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.125
They're Milanos, you idiot.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.542
I always thought that was
a little bigoted for a cookie.

00:56.458 --> 00:58.875
(J.D.) <i>Cookie racism aside,</i>
<i>I had bigger problems.</i>

00:58.959 --> 01:00.667
<i>It had been Three weeks</i>
<i>since our Dad died,</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:02.333
<i>and my brother Dan</i>
<i>was still staying with me.</i>

01:02.417 --> 01:04.166
Hi. Nothing like
a little time off

01:04.250 --> 01:05.959
to remind you how hard you've
been working, huh?

01:06.041 --> 01:07.667
You bartend three shifts a week.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.834
Two. They docked me one
for doinking the Jello-shot girl.

01:09.917 --> 01:10.792
Hey.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.417
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.875
(J.D.) <i>Since I had dumped Elliot</i>
<i>and broke her heart,</i>

01:14.959 --> 01:16.208
<i>she couldn't really be there for me.</i>

01:16.291 --> 01:18.583
<i>But thankfully,</i>
<i>she was there for my brother.</i>

01:19.542 --> 01:20.500
You doing okay?

01:20.583 --> 01:22.000
-I am now.
-(clinks bottles)

01:22.083 --> 01:23.250
You know, without Elliot,

01:23.333 --> 01:25.083
I never would have gotten through
my dad's death.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.375
-Our dad's death.
-Right. Air hockey?

01:27.458 --> 01:29.542
Yes.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.083
(J.D.) <i>Oh, hello.</i>

01:31.166 --> 01:33.000
<i>Women are checking me</i>
<i>out lately.</i>

01:33.083 --> 01:37.166
<i>Was it the 10 push-ups I've been cranking</i>
<i>out every other Sunday? Perhaps.</i>

01:37.250 --> 01:41.125
<i>More likely it was the pledge I made</i>
<i>not to date anyone until Elliot did.</i>

01:41.208 --> 01:43.959
<i>See, since then, the gals</i>
<i>have been all over me.</i>

01:44.041 --> 01:45.333
Can I buy you a drink?

01:45.417 --> 01:47.959
I'm sorry, sugar.
The store's closed.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.291
(J.D.) <i>They've been all over me.</i>

01:55.083 --> 01:57.291
Very impressive, but I'm sorry.

01:58.583 --> 02:02.000
You have some gum
on your shoe.

02:02.875 --> 02:04.291
Oh.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.625
(laughs)

02:05.709 --> 02:07.750
Dr. Clock, do you have a minute?

02:07.834 --> 02:10.458
Sure. I was just talking
to Dr. Bromberg about switching shifts

02:10.542 --> 02:11.875
so I can go to Mexico
for my mom's wedding.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.125
I am so psyched.

02:13.208 --> 02:14.542
She is getting married to this guy

02:14.625 --> 02:17.333
that has been like a father to me
since I was this big.

02:17.417 --> 02:18.583
Actually, maybe I was this big.

02:18.667 --> 02:20.083
How tall was I in fourth grade?

02:20.166 --> 02:21.667
It's a mystery.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.917
Now, our old hospital psychiatrist

02:25.000 --> 02:28.208
used to write my wife Enid
a prescription for crazy pills.

02:28.291 --> 02:29.917
He was a dear, dear friend,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.750
but he died or moved or something,

02:31.834 --> 02:33.792
and now I need you to do the honors.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.083
Have her come in
for a few sessions.

02:35.166 --> 02:36.709
I'll gladly prescribe antidepressants.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.458
-That's going to be a problem.
-Why?

02:38.542 --> 02:40.583
She doesn't know she's taking them.

02:41.166 --> 02:42.625
(J.D.) <i>The key to sleeping</i>
<i>in the on-call room</i>

02:42.709 --> 02:44.000
<i>is to block out the noises around you,</i>

02:44.083 --> 02:46.625
<i>like snoring, teeth grinding, or even...</i>

02:46.709 --> 02:48.041
(woman) Ooh.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.333
(J.D.) <i>On-call room nookie.</i>

02:50.417 --> 02:53.542
<i>Hello, my old friend.</i>
<i>How I've missed you.</i>

02:53.625 --> 02:55.542
(woman)
That feels good.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.542
(J.D.) <i>Yes, it does.</i>

02:57.625 --> 02:59.125
(man) Ooh.

02:59.208 --> 03:02.041
(J.D.) <i>Time out.</i>
<i>Male moaning. Party's over.</i>

03:02.125 --> 03:03.750
Hey!

03:05.625 --> 03:06.667
Whoa!

03:06.750 --> 03:08.709
Hey, little brother.

03:10.041 --> 03:15.250
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own</i>
<i>no, I know ♪</i>

03:15.333 --> 03:16.875
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:19.834 --> 03:21.500
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:24.834 --> 03:26.583
You know,
on <i>The Sopranos,</i>

03:26.667 --> 03:29.208
if a guy caught his brother
with his ex-girlfriend,

03:29.291 --> 03:31.000
He'd just rub
his ass out.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.083
Oh, believe you me,
the second I get Dan alone,

03:33.166 --> 03:35.083
there's gonna be some
serious ass rubbing.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.583
I shouldn't smack-talk.

03:37.667 --> 03:38.875
Hey, you mind if I join you guys?

03:38.959 --> 03:40.208
I think the question
you should be asking is

03:40.291 --> 03:42.250
"mind if I diddle your ex?"

03:42.333 --> 03:45.875
Oh, and just a great big congratulations
on your ongoing streak

03:45.959 --> 03:47.709
of being the world's worst older brother.

03:49.917 --> 03:50.959
Thanks, Coxie.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.375
(J.D.) <i>I knew it was my turn</i>
<i>to let Dan have it,</i>

03:53.458 --> 03:55.208
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>I really wasn't mad.</i>

03:55.291 --> 03:57.166
-Listen, Dan--
-J.D., let me explain.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.500
I came to the hospital to see you,

03:58.583 --> 03:59.917
and then I ran into Elliot
and it just happened.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.959
-It was a one-time thing.
-I'm okay with it.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.083
Great. 'Cause it's been
going on for a few weeks.

04:04.166 --> 04:05.542
Elliot's amazing.

04:05.625 --> 04:08.291
Smart, funny, hot.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.583
I was in a dark place,
and she saved me. She really did.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.000
I haven't felt this good
since my dad died.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.250
-Our dad.
-Right.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.166
Hold up.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.542
When Carla and I
came home yesterday,

04:15.625 --> 04:16.834
we heard something.

04:16.917 --> 04:19.291
Did you two hook up
in J.D.'s room?

04:19.375 --> 04:21.208
A friend wouldn't ask,
and a gentleman wouldn't tell.

04:21.291 --> 04:22.959
-Did you?
-Twice.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.250
We didn't go under
the sheets out of respect.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.792
How thoughtful.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.000
I'm so sorry
you lost your grandmother.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.000
Our prayers go out
to you and your family.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.792
Thank you, doctor.
That's very kind.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.750
That'll be $1,700.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.417
Sir--sir?

04:38.500 --> 04:41.000
It is not your job
to collect money from patients.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.583
I know, but I just fired the woman
who usually does it.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.458
You fired Glenda? Why?

04:47.166 --> 04:49.291
Oh, how precious.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.583
Mind if I hold him?

04:50.667 --> 04:51.834
Go right ahead.

04:55.709 --> 04:57.625
I finally got a baby!

04:59.875 --> 05:01.458
She was stealing
from the hospital.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.125
Oh, Dr. Clock.

05:04.208 --> 05:08.083
Uh, look, I'm afraid I wasn't
being honest with you before.

05:08.166 --> 05:10.583
In my job, it seems like
I'm always the bad guy.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.291
Hard as this is to admit,
it gets to me sometimes.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.750
The point is...

05:14.834 --> 05:17.000
The antidepressants
I asked you to prescribe

05:17.083 --> 05:19.333
weren't for my wife, they were for me.

05:19.417 --> 05:20.667
Oh, I understand.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.291
So what dosage are you on?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.250
(Enid) Where are my Fig Newtons,
Bob?

05:26.333 --> 05:28.166
I'm getting them, dear.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.625
About half a Newton.

05:31.709 --> 05:33.041
No dice.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.500
-Ugh.
-Hey.

05:35.583 --> 05:39.291
Boy, oh, boy, it looks like you
pissed off the wrong guy there, Crunchy.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.625
And trust me, he'll make you pay.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.250
Oh, Dr. Kelso's all bluster.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.125
Underneath it all,
I bet he's a sweetheart.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.625
No, no,
underneath it all,

05:46.709 --> 05:48.208
he is pure evil.

05:48.291 --> 05:49.959
Perry, no one's pure evil.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.959
I mean, yes, some people
have a hard outer shell,

05:52.041 --> 05:55.250
but inside, everybody
has a creamy center.

05:55.333 --> 05:58.959
There are plenty of people here
on this particular planet

05:59.041 --> 06:02.583
who are hard on the outside
and hard on the inside.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.834
So they have more
of a nougatey center?

06:04.917 --> 06:08.583
Lady, people aren't
chocolates.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.166
Do you know what
they are mostly?

06:10.250 --> 06:11.291
Bastards.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.959
Bastard-coated bastards
with bastard filling.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.875
But I don't find them
half as annoying

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
as I find naive
bubble-headed optimists

06:18.083 --> 06:21.458
who walk around
vomiting sunshine.

06:21.542 --> 06:24.917
I'm touching your
creamy center.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.792
Oh, I am so very angry

06:27.875 --> 06:32.959
that I'm going to find someone
to kill just to prove her wrong.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.166
(moans)

06:35.250 --> 06:37.083
(moans)

06:37.166 --> 06:39.083
(growls)

06:39.166 --> 06:41.792
Why you acting like that whole
Dan and Elliot thing doesn't bother you?

06:41.875 --> 06:42.875
Because it doesn't.

06:42.917 --> 06:44.834
Dude. You're missing a great
opportunity here, man.

06:44.917 --> 06:46.709
If you act like it bothered you,
Elliot will feel guilty,

06:46.792 --> 06:48.709
and she'll finally
forgive you for dumping her.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.542
I'm telling you. You gotta use this
like I use my diabetes.

06:51.625 --> 06:52.834
Watch.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.542
Honey, my blood sugar's dipping.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.709
Don't move.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.250
Thanks, sweetness.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.709
Oh, my God.
This could be my diabetes.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.583
Exactly, but you gotta use it
before that window closes.

07:12.667 --> 07:16.000
Lucky for me, my diabetes window
stays open 24/7.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.500
Unless, God forbid,
they find a cure.

07:18.583 --> 07:19.834
Amen, brother.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.041
Bye, folks.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.083
You'll notice I knocked
a hundred dollars off the bill

07:25.166 --> 07:27.792
because of the, you know,
baby stealing thing.

07:30.792 --> 07:31.834
(J.D.) <i>Turk was right.</i>

07:31.917 --> 07:33.083
<i>Lying to Elliot</i>
<i>was the perfect way</i>

07:33.166 --> 07:34.458
<i>to get our friendship</i>
<i>back to normal.</i>

07:34.542 --> 07:36.792
(shouting) Thanks for
the loaner scooter, Johnny.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.583
(shouting) I want to talk to you
for a second.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.250
Can you turn that thing off?

07:40.333 --> 07:43.250
-Sorry.
-(turns off engine)

07:43.333 --> 07:44.709
(revving)

07:44.792 --> 07:46.625
-(all turn off engines)
-Sorry!

07:46.709 --> 07:49.375
(chain saw revving)

07:49.458 --> 07:50.917
Sorry.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.333
Look, when I caught
you two yesterday,

07:52.417 --> 07:55.625
I didn't know what to say,
but now I do.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.709
You really hurt me.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.375
Okey-dokey.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.500
(engines revving)

08:01.583 --> 08:03.000
(chain saw revving)

08:03.083 --> 08:07.125
Guys! There are sick
people trying to sleep!

08:07.208 --> 08:10.041
(revving stops)

08:10.125 --> 08:12.250
J.D., are you really this upset?

08:12.333 --> 08:14.583
Well how would you feel if I hooked up
with one of your siblings?

08:14.667 --> 08:17.083
A little confused considering
I have four brothers...

08:17.166 --> 08:19.875
But not surprised. At you or Barry.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.375
(mouthing) Barry?

08:21.458 --> 08:24.041
I guess I just didn't think
I was doing anything wrong.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.375
Well, obviously, you did,

08:25.417 --> 08:27.166
or you would have told me about it
from the beginning.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.083
(J.D.)
<i>That one had to sting.</i>

08:29.166 --> 08:31.166
<i>I really want to look back</i>
<i>and see if it landed,</i>

08:31.250 --> 08:33.875
<i>but I'll have to go back</i>
<i>to sad face first.</i>

08:37.458 --> 08:38.917
<i>Oh, it landed.</i>

08:41.375 --> 08:44.166
Dr. Clock, may I have a word?

08:44.250 --> 08:46.166
Uh-oh. It's payback time.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.625
I got you a present
for your trip to Mexico.

08:49.709 --> 08:53.500
It's my old
Spanish-to-English dictionary.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.625
I don't need it anymore.
I've mastered the language.

08:56.709 --> 08:58.041
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

08:58.125 --> 08:59.875
You're welcome-o.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.583
You were right.
Payback's a bitch.

09:03.667 --> 09:08.000
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

09:08.083 --> 09:10.542
Well, just get back to me
when you have an answer.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.208
Baby, check this out.

09:14.291 --> 09:18.125
Dr. Kelso just offered me Glenda's old job
as administrative supervisor.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.417
Oh, that's great, sweetie.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.834
The job pays an extra
$7,000 a year.

09:21.917 --> 09:24.625
My baby's an administrative supervisor!

09:24.709 --> 09:26.542
Let's celebrate!
Whatever you want.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.208
Oh! Let's go shopping
for a new duvet cover.

09:29.291 --> 09:30.667
I'd love to,

09:30.750 --> 09:32.458
but my diabetes
is acting up.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.583
Bob, we have a problem.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.583
Not now, Perry.
I'm swamped.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.208
I'm trying to find an exterminator
to kill the bat in my attic.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.375
Be a man, Bob.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.208
That's what
tennis rackets are for.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.083
(barks)

09:48.166 --> 09:50.000
Oh, good lord!
He got Baxter!

09:50.083 --> 09:52.250
Try telling that to my one-eared dog.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.834
Bob, do you realize what you did
by giving blondie that book?

09:55.917 --> 09:58.125
With any luck, I kept her
from reporting me to the board

09:58.208 --> 09:59.375
for trying to con her
out of meds.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.000
Thanks to your little gesture,

10:01.083 --> 10:02.875
she actually believes
that the earth

10:02.959 --> 10:05.041
is full of people who deep down

10:05.125 --> 10:07.041
are filled with kindness and caring.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.083
Why, that's absurd.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.625
People are bastard-coated bastards
with bastard filling.

10:10.709 --> 10:11.834
Exactly.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.500
Sweet Moses.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.750
Everything has gone
straight down the crapper

10:15.834 --> 10:17.792
since Enid got off
the antidepressants.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.959
I didn't know Enid
suffered from depression.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.959
She doesn't. Those pills
kill her sex drive.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.750
Oh.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.041
Dude, your idea
totally worked.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.208
Incoming.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.625
My own brother! Why?!

10:32.709 --> 10:35.208
Oh, God! It hurts so bad!

10:35.291 --> 10:36.625
You can stop now. She's gone.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.834
No, I think I broke my hand.

10:38.917 --> 10:42.875
(J.D.) <i>There's nothing more satisfying</i>
<i>than having a good plan.</i>

10:44.458 --> 10:45.458
Good night, amigos.

10:45.542 --> 10:46.583
-Night.
-Night.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.750
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes a plan</i>
<i>can crystallize in a moment.</i>

10:53.917 --> 10:55.041
What are we gonna do?

10:55.125 --> 10:56.291
Let's destroy her.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.166
(J.D.) <i>And sometimes a plan can fall apart</i>
<i>just as quickly.</i>

10:59.250 --> 11:01.834
Ahhhh. So when do you
start your new job?

11:01.917 --> 11:03.041
I turned it down.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.166
What?

11:04.250 --> 11:05.417
I know it's a dream job,

11:05.500 --> 11:06.542
but with your diabetes,

11:06.625 --> 11:08.333
I think you need me more.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.208
(J.D.) <i>Of course, in my plan,</i>
<i>nobody gets hurt.</i>

11:15.291 --> 11:16.208
Hey, little brother.

11:16.291 --> 11:17.750
Aah!

11:17.834 --> 11:20.375
What are you doing
back in the tub?!

11:20.458 --> 11:22.250
Elliot dumped me.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.250
(J.D.) <i>Except my brother.</i>

11:28.875 --> 11:30.750

11:40.125 --> 11:43.959
(off-key)
<i>♪ What went wrong? ♪</i>

11:44.041 --> 11:45.166
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

11:45.250 --> 11:46.792
No, J.D., I don't.
Because Elliot was the best thing

11:46.875 --> 11:49.583
that ever happened to me,
and now she's gone.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.208
<i>♪ Oh, she's gone ♪</i>

11:53.291 --> 11:54.792

11:54.875 --> 11:56.166
♪ <i>She's gone, she's gone</i> ♪

11:56.250 --> 11:57.458
That's not even
the right gibberish.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.667
You know what, J.D.?
Elliot and I were supposed to have

11:59.750 --> 12:01.959
our big romantic evening together.
Look at all this stuff.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.834
I bought candles,
champagne,

12:04.917 --> 12:05.959
a Dido cd.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.709
I guess I'll just
throw these things out

12:09.792 --> 12:12.333
with the rest
of the garbage.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.125
Oh, come on. Don't go.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.625
We can watch <i>Kangaroo Jack</i>

12:15.709 --> 12:17.667
and chug a Fosters
every time they say "g'day."

12:17.750 --> 12:19.375
-G'day, J.D.
-Dan!

12:19.458 --> 12:21.333
(Australian accent)
I said g'day!

12:22.875 --> 12:24.625
Baby, you have
to take this job.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.750
Let it go. It's done.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.333
-You okay?
-No.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.333
Sometimes I wish I'd never
gotten this stupid diabetes.

12:32.417 --> 12:34.625
Hey! Let's not get crazy.

12:37.208 --> 12:40.583
(whistling theme from
<i>The Andy Griffith show)</i>

12:44.083 --> 12:47.125
Dear God. She has an actual
skip in her step.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.458
It doesn't bother me
as much as the whistling.

12:49.542 --> 12:50.959
Watch what happens.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.625
(whistling theme from
<i>The Andy Griffith show)</i>

12:54.709 --> 12:58.291
(whistling same theme)

12:58.375 --> 13:01.917
(whistling same theme)

13:05.500 --> 13:08.417
Why are you whistling, Ted?
Your life is pathetic.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.917
Right.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.500
Perry, what's our plan
of attack?

13:13.583 --> 13:15.125
When I crush
a person's spirit,

13:15.208 --> 13:17.792
I like to use a combination
of intimidation and degradation.

13:17.875 --> 13:19.542
I prefer to create an environment

13:19.625 --> 13:21.625
in which the subjects
end up crushing themselves.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.959
I like to pick one person

13:24.041 --> 13:26.250
and torment them relentlessly
for no reason.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.792
If I could find him, I'd show you.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.417
He's near.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.875
Well, I'm not sure moonbeam's
going to break so easily.

13:38.959 --> 13:42.417
I just wish we knew something personal
that would really get to her.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.834
Turns out you can't go
to your mom's wedding.

13:46.917 --> 13:48.250
There's too much shift switching
going on here,

13:48.333 --> 13:50.000
and I don't like shift switching.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.709
It's too hard to say.

13:52.542 --> 13:56.625
Aw. That wasn't very
soft and creamy.

13:56.709 --> 13:59.542
It's okay.
He has a hospital to run.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.208
I understand.

14:01.291 --> 14:06.333
(whistling theme from
<i>The Andy Griffith show)</i>

14:06.417 --> 14:12.417
(all whistling theme from
<i>the Andy Griffith show)</i>

14:12.500 --> 14:16.583
Good God. She can't be stopped.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.583
Let me get this straight.

14:19.667 --> 14:22.500
You want me to offer your wife
the same job she's already turned down,

14:22.583 --> 14:24.125
is that about the size of it, Turkelton?

14:24.208 --> 14:26.333
Actually, sir, my last name
isn't Turkelton.

14:26.417 --> 14:28.750
It's just Turk,
as in Chris Turk.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.583
I prefer Turkelton.

14:31.667 --> 14:34.709
Sir, I promise you, if you offer her
the job again, she'll say yes.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.500
And I'll do anything.
I'll pick up extra shifts.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.250
I'll volunteer--I'll volunteer
at the clinic.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.333
-Whatever you want.
-Ah.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.041
I want you to kill the giant bat

14:42.125 --> 14:43.917
that's been living in my attic.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.834
You keep Enid in the attic?

14:45.917 --> 14:46.834
(laughs)

14:46.917 --> 14:48.250
You make me laugh, Turkelton.

14:48.333 --> 14:51.917
8:00 sharp. I'd wear goggles.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.166
Yes!

(J.D.) <i>I decided the only way</i>
<i>Elliot would take Dan back</i>

14:58.125 --> 14:59.667
<i>was if she knew the truth:</i>

14:59.750 --> 15:02.542
<i>That their being together</i>
<i>didn't really bother me.</i>

15:03.709 --> 15:06.000
Elliot, we need to talk.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.834
Nice jammies!

15:07.917 --> 15:10.041
(laughs)
Thanks. They're new.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.041
This will only take a second. Look...

15:12.125 --> 15:15.000
You know how I told you
I was upset about you and Dan?

15:15.083 --> 15:16.291
Is that champagne?

15:16.375 --> 15:19.917
Yeah. Yeah, I was celebrating
my new jammies.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.375
I love champagne.
You mind if I have a little--

15:22.417 --> 15:23.834
Thank you. A nipper.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.917
Ah. Tingly.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.166
It's a tingly drink.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.125
Ooh. Pretty candles.

15:31.208 --> 15:33.834
Anywho, I know you broke up with Dan
because you thought I was upset,

15:33.917 --> 15:35.959
but in reality, I, uh--

15:36.041 --> 15:37.583
I...

<i>♪ I--I want to thank you ♪</i>

15:41.166 --> 15:44.500

I love this song.
Who is it?

15:46.250 --> 15:49.125
Dido--and you've really got to meet
my brother Barry.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.291
Dido?

Hey, little brother.

-Aah!

Tingles.

-Carla, we have to talk.
-Is it your blood sugar again?

16:15.083 --> 16:17.417
I'll get you something.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.875
Baby, I feel fine.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.083
It's just that I've kinda
been using my diabetes

16:23.166 --> 16:24.458
to get you to, you know,

16:24.542 --> 16:26.750
hook me up with sandwiches
and whatnot.

16:27.542 --> 16:30.542
I can't believe you!

16:30.625 --> 16:32.583
Oh, man!
I brought that from home!

16:32.667 --> 16:34.959
Look, baby, before
you get freaked out,

16:35.041 --> 16:36.333
I fixed it already. Look.

16:36.417 --> 16:39.667
Nurse Turkelton, I wanted to offer you
that job once more.

16:39.750 --> 16:40.750
I don't want it.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.291
Great. See you Saturday, Batman.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.625
Baby, what the hell?!

16:44.709 --> 16:47.166
Um, maybe I decided right away

16:47.250 --> 16:48.333
that I didn't want that job

16:48.417 --> 16:50.000
because I'd miss
working with patients,

16:50.083 --> 16:52.208
but I didn't tell you because you were
excited about the extra money,

16:52.291 --> 16:54.000
so I used your diabetes
as an excuse.

16:54.083 --> 16:57.000
I don't know.
I don't really remember.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.792
It tastes funny.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.750
You see, Bob? It didn't even faze her.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.709
Patience, Perry.
With a tough one like her,

17:12.792 --> 17:14.375
you have to wait for it.

17:15.083 --> 17:17.583
Here it comes.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.625
And we've broken her.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.000
There sits a dejected woman,
all alone.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.875
-Wounded.
-Vulnerable.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.208
Crying.

17:26.291 --> 17:27.750
She's ruining it for me.

17:27.834 --> 17:28.834
Aw.

17:29.542 --> 17:30.709
Lady, stop crying!

17:34.458 --> 17:37.125
Dr. Clock, you don't have
to miss your wedding.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.917
I was lying about shift switching.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.709
I like doing it. I like saying it.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.375
Shift switching.
And I only lied

17:42.458 --> 17:44.458
because we were trying
to destroy your morale.

17:44.542 --> 17:45.542
Why would you do that?

17:45.625 --> 17:48.375
In our defense, you're overly cheery,
and we were bored.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.667
But you thought it would be nice
to come clean and make me feel better?

17:50.750 --> 17:51.959
-Pretty much.
-Pretty much, yeah.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.542
See, I told you there
was good in everyone.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.250
If you'll excuse me, boys.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.667
I've got a plane to catch.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.125
Don't even pretend like you knew
what we were doing all along.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.625
(car horn honks)

18:03.834 --> 18:05.000
<i>Adios,</i> boys.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.917
Was she always
wearing that big hat?

18:13.709 --> 18:15.166
I can't believe you two
never broke up.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.750
Dan was in my tub for four hours

18:16.834 --> 18:18.667
drinking beers and singing <i>She's Gone.</i>

18:18.750 --> 18:20.709
How do you take a bath?

18:20.792 --> 18:22.333
Okay. I'm gonna get dressed.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.291
Hey, Elliot, do you mind if I borrow
one of your socks?

18:24.375 --> 18:25.750
I seem to have lost my righty in the fray.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.834
Oh, there you are, high flyer.

18:27.917 --> 18:29.750
(Sniffs) Hmm.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.709
J.D., Dan and I both know
this is just a fling.

18:32.792 --> 18:35.625
Still, I feel like the worst person
in the whole world.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.500
Please, can you forgive me?

18:37.583 --> 18:40.750
Elliot, I came here to tell you
I was never actually mad at you.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.667
How could you not be mad that
I was hooking up with your brother?

18:43.750 --> 18:46.625
I don't know. I just wasn't.

18:47.250 --> 18:50.083
How could you hook up with my brother
without considering my feelings?

18:50.959 --> 18:52.834
I don't know. I just didn't.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.500
(J.D.) <i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>that Elliot and I</i>

18:54.583 --> 18:57.625
<i>had absolutely no romantic feeling</i>
<i>for each other anymore...</i>

18:59.417 --> 19:01.208
<i>No matter what the situation.</i>

19:04.917 --> 19:08.250
<i>It was a little sad,</i>
<i>but who knows?</i>

19:08.333 --> 19:10.291
<i>Maybe it meant</i>
<i>we could be friends again.</i>

19:11.458 --> 19:14.875
(Dan) Hey! I can't find my Dido CD!

19:16.959 --> 19:20.166
(whispering) If my heart could
write songs, they'd sound like these.

19:24.709 --> 19:27.166
(J.D.) <i>I think relationships</i>
<i>are inherently fragile.</i>

19:27.750 --> 19:30.083
<i>They can be strengthened</i>
<i>by a shared excuse.</i>

19:30.166 --> 19:33.667
Turk, we just got invited to Linda's
"Jack and Jill" bridal shower.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.875
Do you mind if I use your diabetes
to get out of it?

19:35.959 --> 19:37.417
Of course not, baby.

19:39.417 --> 19:41.083
And now...

19:41.166 --> 19:43.875
It's bat-killing time.

19:43.959 --> 19:46.750
(wings flapping)

19:48.625 --> 19:51.166
Oh, good Lord!

19:54.041 --> 19:55.625
Aah!

19:56.583 --> 19:58.291
(J.D.) <i>Others can be torn apart</i>

19:58.375 --> 20:00.000
<i>by the loss of</i>
<i>a common enemy.</i>

20:00.083 --> 20:01.500
I hate you, Bob.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.417
Same times a thousand,
big guy.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.667
Well, good night, little bro.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.500
Oh, night, Dan. Sleep tight.

20:12.583 --> 20:15.041
There's a bus schedule
underneath your pillow.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.500
(J.D.) <i>And for Elliot and I,</i>

20:17.583 --> 20:19.792
<i>turns out all we needed</i>
<i>was a little time.</i>

20:19.875 --> 20:21.125
Night, J.D.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.375
What was that for?

20:28.125 --> 20:30.458
(J.D.) <i>The good news was</i>
<i>this Elliot and Dan thing</i>

20:30.542 --> 20:32.959
<i>meant that I was</i>
<i>back on the market.</i>

20:33.041 --> 20:34.750
Can I buy you a drink?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.625
No, thanks.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.542
(J.D.) <i>Yep. I'm back, baby.</i>

20:41.875 --> 20:43.792
More nuts, please.
