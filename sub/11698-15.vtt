WEBVTT

00:00.965 --> 00:03.080
So, I can't believe I was so drunk,

00:03.081 --> 00:03.832
I accidentally got

00:03.833 --> 00:05.630
the wrong name tattooed on my wrist.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.924
What do you think? Any chance it'll fade?

00:09.527 --> 00:10.595
Sure.

00:10.596 --> 00:12.491
As long as you got it out of a cereal box

00:12.492 --> 00:13.997
and licked it on with your tongue.

00:15.260 --> 00:16.969
Well, at least you didn't
get anything pierced.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.951
Taking Nana through a metal detector

00:19.297 --> 00:20.945
was always pretty hinky after that.

00:22.242 --> 00:23.567
I just don't know how I'm gonna explain

00:23.568 --> 00:24.711
this to Amy.

00:24.712 --> 00:26.606
I truly am the world's biggest idiot.

00:26.607 --> 00:27.788
Okay, it's official.

00:27.789 --> 00:29.559
I truly am the world's biggest idiot.

00:30.109 --> 00:31.915
Dude! Why does everything always have to be

00:31.916 --> 00:34.383
a competition with you?
I'm the biggest idiot!

00:34.384 --> 00:35.585
What are you talking about?!

00:37.141 --> 00:39.669
Okay, yeah, maybe you win.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.477
I just can't find Emma's paperwork.

00:41.478 --> 00:42.919
Well, honey, just so you know,

00:42.920 --> 00:44.483
even if you have the original receipt,

00:44.484 --> 00:45.719
you can't return a baby.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.282
I tried.

00:47.283 --> 00:48.652
Twice.

00:48.653 --> 00:50.369
I need to find the paper that Angela signed

00:50.370 --> 00:51.724
when she left Emma on the doorstep

00:51.725 --> 00:53.251
giving me sole custody.

00:53.252 --> 00:54.554
I'm finally getting health insurance

00:54.555 --> 00:55.924
for me and my dependents.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.278
What if I can't find it?

00:57.279 --> 00:58.839
What if I have to talk to Angela?

00:59.153 --> 01:01.438
<i>I haven't talked to her
since the night I made her.</i>

01:02.339 --> 01:03.850
I barely remember what she looks like.

01:03.851 --> 01:06.978
Oh, and that'll make a lovely
toast at Emma's wedding.

01:08.162 --> 01:09.298
Relax.

01:09.299 --> 01:13.155
You gave me all important
baby-related items for safekeeping.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.870
- You have all the papers?
- Yup.

01:14.871 --> 01:16.787
- You can stop panicking.
- Thank you, mom.

01:17.662 --> 01:18.814
What would I do without you?

01:19.236 --> 01:21.017
Probably pay for childcare.

01:21.363 --> 01:22.884
Here's your baby.

01:25.453 --> 01:35.450
Synced and corrected by
Nantinha ~ www.addic7ed.com ~

01:36.051 --> 01:37.307
Hey.

01:38.297 --> 01:40.935
Oh! Look at you standing up.

01:40.936 --> 01:43.291
Daddy's little girl is
becoming daddy's big girl.

01:44.450 --> 01:46.383
So...

01:46.384 --> 01:47.920
What do you think we should do today?

01:51.088 --> 01:53.178
I suggest something involving balloons.

01:54.342 --> 01:56.058
- It's me!
- Riley?

02:01.013 --> 02:02.357
Nice look!

02:02.358 --> 02:03.810
Did you mug a clown?

02:04.640 --> 02:06.131
They're a birthday present from my mother

02:06.441 --> 02:08.256
because she loves to get me things I hate.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.472
But, it's not your...

02:11.438 --> 02:13.275
Oh, my God! It's your birthday!

02:14.341 --> 02:16.571
And I knew that! Here, I got you, um...

02:18.859 --> 02:20.362
Wow, I'm surprisingly attached

02:20.363 --> 02:21.731
to everything in this apartment.

02:26.676 --> 02:29.450
Well, first of all, it's tomorrow.

02:29.814 --> 02:31.616
And second of all, I
don't really celebrate it.

02:31.975 --> 02:33.177
So you're good.

02:33.178 --> 02:34.300
What are you talking about?

02:34.301 --> 02:36.710
You used to have parties all
the time when you were a kid.

02:36.711 --> 02:39.157
If I recall, you were
quite a fan of the cake.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.621
Well, I sorta stopped
celebrating after, you know...

02:46.972 --> 02:48.351
After I know what?

02:49.183 --> 02:50.345
Did something happen?

02:51.283 --> 02:53.304
Um. No.

02:53.891 --> 02:55.383
No, nothing happened. I'm just...

02:55.722 --> 02:58.331
Not really that into it,
so you enjoy the balloons

02:58.332 --> 02:59.930
and I gotta get back to work and open

02:59.931 --> 03:02.648
a giant card signed by a
bunch of people I barely know.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.557
"Happy birthday, Miley."

03:07.879 --> 03:09.548
Mrs. Wheeler, hey. I got your text.

03:09.549 --> 03:10.612
Is everything okay?

03:10.613 --> 03:12.692
Sit down. We've got a problem.

03:13.447 --> 03:16.158
You know those papers
I was keeping for Ben?

03:16.159 --> 03:17.916
Oh, my God! You lost them?!

03:17.917 --> 03:20.070
No!

03:20.921 --> 03:22.215
They're right here.

03:22.611 --> 03:25.350
How irresponsible do you think I am?

03:26.494 --> 03:28.543
I just, um...

03:28.544 --> 03:31.350
May or may not have mailed them in on time

03:31.351 --> 03:35.195
and now Ben may or may not
have sole custody of Emma.

03:37.306 --> 03:39.498
Closer to may not.

03:41.176 --> 03:43.378
Ben doesn't have sole custody?!

03:43.379 --> 03:44.851
What is wrong with you, woman?!

03:45.333 --> 03:47.435
I don't know!

03:47.973 --> 03:51.004
There was all the excitement
around the new baby

03:51.005 --> 03:53.452
and, you know, plus, I
didn't have any stamps!

03:55.141 --> 03:56.399
Look, okay,

03:56.718 --> 03:59.752
we just need to get Angela
to resign this document

03:59.753 --> 04:01.153
and we'll be fine.

04:01.154 --> 04:03.380
Oh, my God. Ben is going to freak.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.390
Wait.

04:07.158 --> 04:09.113
What do you mean by "we"?

04:09.589 --> 04:12.154
I thought since you're his best friend

04:12.155 --> 04:15.513
and you're the only one
who's actually seen her...

04:15.514 --> 04:16.805
Seen her?!

04:16.807 --> 04:19.267
Ben pointed her out across
a crowded room and said,

04:19.267 --> 04:21.261
"can you believe I talked
her into coming home with me?"

04:22.488 --> 04:25.416
Tucker, you have to help me.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.924
Okay? You're really my only hope.

04:28.350 --> 04:29.585
Please.

04:30.196 --> 04:31.748
Well, I can see you're desperate.

04:32.957 --> 04:34.622
Which I enjoy, so I'm in.

04:37.435 --> 04:39.005
Oh, Danny, I am so sorry.

04:39.424 --> 04:40.635
I thought it was only sprained.

04:40.636 --> 04:42.088
I had no idea it was actually broken.

04:42.653 --> 04:43.965
When does it come off?

04:43.966 --> 04:45.925
I can have it removed in three weeks.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.693
The cast. Just the cast.

04:49.931 --> 04:51.687
All right, Emma's finally asleep.

04:52.007 --> 04:54.373
If I never hear "itsy bitsy spider" again,

04:54.374 --> 04:56.467
I will be an itsy bitsy bit happier.

04:57.572 --> 04:58.695
Hey, Danny, what's the deal

04:58.696 --> 05:00.317
with Riley not wanting
to celebrate her birthday?

05:00.630 --> 05:02.305
Are you really asking me that question?

05:02.306 --> 05:03.659
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was me.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.005
Seriously, why does she hate it so much?

05:07.006 --> 05:08.780
Ben, Riley hasn't celebrated her birthday

05:08.781 --> 05:11.567
since her disastrous not-so-sweet 16.

05:11.568 --> 05:13.070
Disastrous? What happened?

05:13.425 --> 05:14.736
<i>Not what happened.</i>

05:15.337 --> 05:16.884
<i>Who happened.</i>

05:18.317 --> 05:19.717
Are you sure you wanna see this?

05:19.903 --> 05:22.227
What's the big deal? I was there.

05:22.228 --> 05:24.880
And I think I'd remember if
anything disastrous happened.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.071
All right.

05:32.253 --> 05:33.687
Yeah, mom!

05:33.688 --> 05:35.705
All right, come on,
people. Let's get going.

05:35.706 --> 05:37.562
I've got spin class in 20 minutes.

05:38.124 --> 05:41.080
Bikes nailed to the floor,
like that's gonna last.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.952
<i>Here we come!</i>

05:45.567 --> 05:47.078
Careful.

05:49.253 --> 05:51.763
Danny, where are we going?

05:51.764 --> 05:53.966
<i>Luckily the future,</i>

05:53.967 --> 05:57.037
where you gain a real mustache
and she loses a person.

05:58.632 --> 06:00.663
Okay, I'm gonna take off the blindfold.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.172
Surprise!

06:03.173 --> 06:04.643
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

06:04.644 --> 06:06.449
I always wanted a surprise party.

06:06.753 --> 06:08.416
Thank you.

06:14.964 --> 06:16.662
Dude, what's wrong with you?

06:16.663 --> 06:18.464
You totally smelled her hair.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.436
It's like you liked her or something.

06:24.279 --> 06:25.578
Is Ben here?

06:25.579 --> 06:26.821
Didn't he come?

06:28.472 --> 06:30.836
<i>Benjamin Wheeler, get over here</i>

06:30.837 --> 06:32.857
<i>and wish Riley a happy birthday.</i>

06:33.895 --> 06:35.191
<i>Just do it.</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:42.465
- Hi, Ben.
- Hey, Riles.

06:42.466 --> 06:43.693
Happy birthday.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.074

06:56.499 --> 06:58.427
Oh, come on. She should
have seen that coming

06:58.428 --> 06:59.759
when I hugged her.

07:00.630 --> 07:04.609
Okay, so far this is definitely
my best birthday ever.

07:04.937 --> 07:06.553
Oh, my God, is that cake?

07:09.299 --> 07:10.479
<i>What are you doing?</i>

07:10.848 --> 07:13.758
<i>Do not tell me that you
did something to that cake.</i>

07:14.131 --> 07:16.527
Okay, I didn't do anything to the cake.

07:16.528 --> 07:17.870
<i>Okay, keep it up, buddy.</i>

07:17.871 --> 07:19.519
<i>If you pull one of your
stupid little pranks,</i>

07:19.520 --> 07:21.610
<i>I swear to God, I'm taking
away your dial-up Internet.</i>

07:23.457 --> 07:24.810
<i>Make a wish!</i>

07:32.551 --> 07:33.585
Ben!

07:44.502 --> 07:46.796
Will you please turn it off?

07:46.797 --> 07:48.343
<i>Riley, wait!</i>

07:53.219 --> 07:54.462
Wow!

07:54.463 --> 07:56.290
I remember that being a lot funnier.

07:58.114 --> 07:59.627
Okay, it's official.

07:59.628 --> 08:02.110
I am the worst person that's ever lived.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.842
I'm feeling the need to say, "oh, no, Ben.

08:04.843 --> 08:06.262
That's not true."

08:06.263 --> 08:07.758
But that would be a lie.

08:10.009 --> 08:11.574
No wonder she doesn't like her birthday.

08:12.185 --> 08:13.596
This is all my fault.

08:14.387 --> 08:16.288
I have to do something
to make it up to her.

08:16.289 --> 08:18.002
Bro, I'm telling you...

08:18.003 --> 08:19.239
Just let it go.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.677
Do I what I did with that hockey hair

08:20.678 --> 08:22.133
and cut your losses.

08:23.165 --> 08:25.074
Actually, try to save it with a perm first,

08:25.075 --> 08:26.820
then cut your losses.

08:32.192 --> 08:34.123
What? Just be glad you weren't there

08:34.124 --> 08:35.962
for the mohawk and mutton chops phase.

08:35.964 --> 08:37.451
Oh, no, I am.

08:37.941 --> 08:39.895
But I'm just curious, um...

08:40.499 --> 08:42.086
Is Riley still in love with Ben,

08:42.087 --> 08:44.525
or was that just something
from back when they were kids?

08:44.856 --> 08:46.061
Riley?

08:46.062 --> 08:47.520
In love with Ben?

08:47.521 --> 08:49.361
I don't know what video you were watching.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.825
It was so obvious.

08:51.203 --> 08:52.726
I mean, I'm not wrong, am I?

08:53.174 --> 08:55.346
She might have kinda had a crush on him.

08:55.347 --> 08:57.701
And she still really
likes him, doesn't she?

08:59.103 --> 09:00.415
Maybe.

09:01.012 --> 09:03.461
And, I mean, it doesn't
take a PHD to see that

09:03.462 --> 09:05.635
Ben obviously has feelings for her.

09:06.192 --> 09:08.454
Remember when you said to tell you
when you're acting like a therapist?

09:08.455 --> 09:10.607
And not a girlfriend?
You're doing it again.

09:11.019 --> 09:13.983
I'm sorry, I just don't understand
why you haven't told Ben.

09:15.511 --> 09:16.669
Unless of course,

09:16.670 --> 09:18.976
you're still in love with Riley.

09:25.655 --> 09:27.591
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

09:27.592 --> 09:28.646
How's it going?

09:28.647 --> 09:30.519
I'm just trying to figure
out what kind of gift says

09:30.520 --> 09:32.312
"I'm sorry I'm me."

09:33.518 --> 09:35.268
Come on, it's not that bad.

09:35.269 --> 09:38.037
Not that bad? I ruined her sweet sixteen.

09:38.437 --> 09:41.048
It's no wonder I can never figure
out a way to get her to like me.

09:42.388 --> 09:43.623
Ben,

09:43.624 --> 09:45.186
there's something you need to know.

09:45.187 --> 09:47.247
Dude, unless you know what I
should get her for her birthday,

09:47.248 --> 09:48.559
it really doesn't matter.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.230
Well, I think I know what she wants.

09:51.231 --> 09:52.362
Really? Like what?

09:53.672 --> 09:54.802
You.

09:57.002 --> 09:58.117
Me?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.890
Riley's been in love with
you since we were kids.

10:07.978 --> 10:09.716
Are you saying that she actually likes me?!

10:10.210 --> 10:12.066
Likes me? Has always been in like with me?

10:12.067 --> 10:13.632
May possibly love me?

10:14.784 --> 10:16.407
Maybe not around her birthday,

10:16.408 --> 10:18.948
but the rest of the time, definitely a fan.

10:18.949 --> 10:20.774
That's amazing!

10:21.168 --> 10:22.531
But why didn't you tell me before?

10:23.004 --> 10:25.587
Well, it might have
involved a threat to my life

10:26.095 --> 10:27.363
and a double pinky swear.

10:28.852 --> 10:31.056
But since you really seem to like her back,

10:31.474 --> 10:33.295
I'm willing to face the consequences.

10:33.296 --> 10:35.509
So... so what do I do?
Do I just go over there

10:35.510 --> 10:38.285
and say, "Riley, it's me, Ben."

10:38.286 --> 10:39.556
And throw myself at her?

10:40.309 --> 10:42.008
Are there any other options?

10:42.801 --> 10:44.107
You're right. You're right.

10:44.472 --> 10:46.270
I need to make amends first.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.712
I need to arrange the greatest birthday

10:48.713 --> 10:50.019
of all time!

10:50.020 --> 10:51.573
And then throw myself at her.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.423
Will you help?

10:54.424 --> 10:56.011
With the birthday, not the throwing...

10:56.012 --> 10:57.281
That part I've got down.

10:58.546 --> 11:00.300
Sure. Whatever you need, bro.

11:00.854 --> 11:01.922
Thanks, man.

11:02.831 --> 11:04.143
You're the best!

11:12.203 --> 11:13.369
You are so good.

11:13.370 --> 11:14.991
I can't believe you already found her.

11:14.992 --> 11:16.948
Well, when you're as connected as I am,

11:16.949 --> 11:18.192
it's easy.

11:18.802 --> 11:20.763
Plus, I found her number in Ben's phone.

11:22.128 --> 11:23.735
Okay, so she doesn't suspect anything?

11:23.736 --> 11:25.827
Oh, no way. She's an actress.

11:25.828 --> 11:27.635
She thinks she's coming to meet a producer

11:27.636 --> 11:29.216
about a part in a new movie.

11:29.217 --> 11:31.024
Oh, that's good. That's good.

11:31.025 --> 11:32.148
Okay, so what should I be?

11:32.149 --> 11:34.447
The writer, director? Co-star?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.475
"I'd like to thank the academy."

11:43.464 --> 11:45.210
Maybe on our next movie.

11:45.211 --> 11:46.762
But for now...

11:47.859 --> 11:49.901
You're my assistant.

11:50.905 --> 11:52.574
I'm oddly attracted to you.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.043
Oh, there she is.

12:05.044 --> 12:06.264
Okay, whatever you do,

12:06.265 --> 12:08.130
just be cool and let me do the talking.

12:08.798 --> 12:10.913
Hi, Mr. Spielberg?

12:13.955 --> 12:16.132
You can call me Tyrell.

12:17.593 --> 12:19.657
Really? Tyrell Spielberg?

12:20.316 --> 12:22.912
And this is my assistant Bonnie.

12:22.913 --> 12:24.688
Hi hi, have a seat.

12:25.387 --> 12:28.465
I just want you to know
that we are huge fans.

12:29.209 --> 12:31.528
Oh, thank you. That is so nice to hear.

12:31.529 --> 12:33.587
Especially since I've
really only done a few soaps

12:33.588 --> 12:35.326
and that birth control commercial.

12:37.441 --> 12:38.637
I'm sorry.

12:38.638 --> 12:40.561
Little irony just went down the wrong way.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.238
Uh, so what can you tell me about the part?

12:45.230 --> 12:46.345
Well...

12:47.139 --> 12:50.316
Obviously you'll be playing the girl.

12:52.218 --> 12:54.235
Well, before he tells you too much more,

12:54.555 --> 12:55.764
I'm gonna need you

12:56.066 --> 12:58.466
to sign this non-disclosure agreement.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.176
It's a pretty top-secret project.

13:00.177 --> 13:01.855
- Oh...
- So I need you to sign here,

13:01.856 --> 13:03.242
here and here, okay?

13:03.548 --> 13:04.816
Yeah. Whoo.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.646
All right.

13:08.647 --> 13:09.649
What?!

13:09.650 --> 13:10.725
What's going on?

13:12.204 --> 13:14.852
Uh, you were just finishing
signing these papers

13:14.853 --> 13:16.173
without asking any questions.

13:16.174 --> 13:18.555
Wait wait. "Parental rights waiver"?

13:18.556 --> 13:19.954
Yeah, it's a working title.

13:21.329 --> 13:23.150
Emma? No, I already signed...

13:23.679 --> 13:26.095
Oh, my God! You're Ben's roommate!

13:29.392 --> 13:31.495
Hey, Angela!

13:31.496 --> 13:33.045
Oh, my...

13:33.046 --> 13:35.052
It is so good to see you again.

13:35.759 --> 13:38.232
And hi, I'm Bonnie Wheeler. Ben's mom.

13:38.661 --> 13:40.689
So great to finally meet the mother

13:40.690 --> 13:43.031
that made this mother a grandmother.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.048
What is the matter with you people?

13:46.049 --> 13:47.645
Why do I have to sign these again?

13:47.646 --> 13:50.552
Well, the paperwork didn't get
filed when it was supposed to.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.985
Nobody knows what happened.

13:54.014 --> 13:55.746
Well, if Ben is so irresponsible

13:55.747 --> 13:58.170
that he lost the papers
and so immature that he

13:58.171 --> 13:59.891
couldn't face me himself,
then maybe he's not

13:59.892 --> 14:01.977
responsible enough to
have sole custody of Emma.

14:04.262 --> 14:06.744
If it makes you feel any better,

14:07.109 --> 14:09.932
we actually do a lot of the work.

14:16.138 --> 14:18.315
Ben, is the blindfold really necessary?

14:18.316 --> 14:21.028
Yes, it is. Today is gonna
be a day full of surprises.

14:21.029 --> 14:22.996
Where are we going?

14:22.997 --> 14:24.941
Did you miss the part about the surprises?

14:24.942 --> 14:26.203
You're just gonna have to trust me.

14:26.204 --> 14:27.741
- I do.
- Okay. Big step.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.428
- All right.
- Okay, here, give me your purse.

14:29.429 --> 14:30.799
- Okay.
- All right.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.984
Now spin around.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.869
- Okay, hold...
- You need a hand?

14:34.870 --> 14:36.601
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

14:36.602 --> 14:38.627
Okay, now have a seat.

14:40.991 --> 14:42.251
Stop that guy!

14:48.706 --> 14:49.845
Yeah, you better run!

14:52.983 --> 14:54.289
Oh, no no no no no!

14:58.949 --> 15:00.446
Are you kidding me?

15:01.540 --> 15:03.048
Oh, this is so much fun.

15:04.219 --> 15:05.392
I can tell already that

15:05.393 --> 15:06.955
this is gonna be the best birthday ever.

15:07.272 --> 15:08.354
Whoo!

15:13.794 --> 15:15.522
How are we gonna explain this to Ben?

15:16.351 --> 15:19.537
We? Oh, hell no! No no no.

15:19.538 --> 15:21.903
I am so done with this "we".

15:21.904 --> 15:23.693
You're the one who
didn't mail in the papers.

15:23.694 --> 15:25.469
Yeah, well, you're the one who found Angela

15:25.470 --> 15:26.965
and brought her back into our lives.

15:26.966 --> 15:28.252
Because you made me!

15:28.966 --> 15:30.157
You're right.

15:30.369 --> 15:32.671
We're both equally to blame.

15:34.384 --> 15:36.217
- Hey.
- Angela!

15:36.521 --> 15:37.558
You came back!

15:39.235 --> 15:41.389
You know there's not really a movie, right?

15:43.457 --> 15:44.558
Look...

15:44.986 --> 15:46.537
We are so sorry.

15:47.234 --> 15:48.507
Yeah, here.

15:49.302 --> 15:52.182
You know what? We should
have just told you the truth.

15:53.622 --> 15:56.234
I know how hard it must have been

15:56.235 --> 15:57.882
to give Emma up the first time.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.488
But please believe us,

16:00.489 --> 16:03.454
we had the right intentions.
We were doing it for Emma.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.181
And I get that.

16:05.687 --> 16:07.260
That's why I gave her up.

16:08.298 --> 16:09.605
You know, and it was hard,

16:09.606 --> 16:11.411
but she needed a home and a family

16:11.412 --> 16:12.737
and people that care about her.

16:13.814 --> 16:15.357
Clearly, she has that.

16:17.962 --> 16:19.775
- Oh, she means us.
- Oh, right, yeah.

16:21.171 --> 16:22.526
Thank you.

16:23.429 --> 16:25.729
Look, my life is kinda all over the place.

16:25.730 --> 16:27.830
Um, so I'm prepared to make you a deal.

16:28.594 --> 16:31.087
I'll sign the papers and
disappear on one condition.

16:32.109 --> 16:33.238
What's that?

16:33.592 --> 16:35.769
I just wanna see a
picture of my little girl.

16:35.770 --> 16:36.816
That's all.

16:37.321 --> 16:38.569
Of course.

16:50.193 --> 16:52.000
She's gotten so big.

16:53.851 --> 16:55.523
And she's so beautiful.

16:58.174 --> 16:59.566
She sure is.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.644
Here, use my pen.

17:08.546 --> 17:10.028
Surprise!

17:10.946 --> 17:13.269
Not yet. Has anyone heard from Riley?

17:13.270 --> 17:14.656
I kinda lost her.

17:14.657 --> 17:15.971
What do you mean you lost her?

17:15.972 --> 17:17.131
We had a plan.

17:17.132 --> 17:18.648
It's a long story.

17:18.650 --> 17:20.549
- Okay, sorry, we're late.
- Surprise!

17:21.179 --> 17:22.410
Aww.

17:22.411 --> 17:24.705
See, I told you people think
Riley and I are sisters.

17:26.292 --> 17:27.709
Did we beat the birthday girl?

17:28.165 --> 17:29.317
Damn.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.283
Hey, you wanna come back in like an hour?

17:31.284 --> 17:32.501
I like to make an entrance.

17:34.216 --> 17:36.119
Found those papers you needed.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.926
See? Right here.

17:37.927 --> 17:39.107
All signed.

17:39.108 --> 17:40.392
Just like they were suppo...

17:40.393 --> 17:42.328
Were. Always had been.

17:43.266 --> 17:45.000
Thank you, but not really
important right now.

17:45.001 --> 17:46.049
Riley's in the city somewhere

17:46.050 --> 17:47.661
with no wallet, no keys and no phone.

17:48.049 --> 17:50.750
Add bad judgment and a leotard,
and that was me in the '80s.

17:55.672 --> 17:56.998
Okay.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.125
I've gotta keep looking.

17:58.126 --> 17:59.360
If anyone hears anything, let me know.

18:02.125 --> 18:03.276
Dude.

18:03.277 --> 18:04.832
- What's going on?
- I didn't mean to.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.454
I was just trying to do
something great and then...

18:06.455 --> 18:07.968
Oh, my God! What is the matter with you?!

18:08.501 --> 18:11.507
This... this is exactly
why I didn't wanna tell you.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.405
Because I knew that you would screw it up.

18:13.406 --> 18:16.163
No matter how great or funny or amazing

18:16.164 --> 18:17.417
you thought it was going to be,

18:17.418 --> 18:19.941
at the end of the day, I
knew you were gonna hurt her!

18:21.072 --> 18:22.508
- That's not true.
- Ben!

18:22.509 --> 18:24.225
Let's face it, you don't deserve her.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.659
So then who does, Danny?

18:29.953 --> 18:31.523
Who does?

18:31.524 --> 18:33.063
Amy, that's not what I was saying.

18:33.656 --> 18:35.333
No, I... I think it was.

18:37.885 --> 18:39.401
I'm sorry, I don't...

18:40.549 --> 18:42.169
I don't think I can do this anymore.

18:44.112 --> 18:45.242
So I think I'm just gonna, um,

18:45.621 --> 18:46.909
get my purse and go.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.663
Surprise!

18:49.664 --> 18:50.977
Amy, wait. Just for a sec.

18:51.314 --> 18:52.925
- Danny, what is she...
- Surprise!

18:52.926 --> 18:55.028
Okay, seriously, people, give it a rest.

18:55.029 --> 18:57.178
Ben Wheeler! You are a dead man.

18:57.497 --> 18:58.672
Riley, you're okay!

18:58.673 --> 19:00.962
No no no, I'm not okay.

19:01.387 --> 19:03.616
By the time I finally
realized that you ditched me,

19:03.617 --> 19:06.689
I was in the Bronx. The Bronx, Ben.

19:07.323 --> 19:09.406
I had to beg people for money

19:09.407 --> 19:11.586
who were already begging people for money.

19:12.702 --> 19:15.215
Look, I have no idea
what your whole plan was,

19:15.216 --> 19:17.516
but this is officially
the worst birthday ever!

19:19.364 --> 19:21.293
Okay, now would actually be a good time.

19:21.742 --> 19:23.446
Surprise!

19:25.209 --> 19:26.541
What is going on?

19:26.542 --> 19:27.976
This is your surprise party.

19:28.403 --> 19:31.221
Look, Riley, I'm so so
sorry. This wasn't the plan.

19:31.829 --> 19:35.061
Central park, a carriage ride.

19:35.062 --> 19:37.767
Rowboat on the lake and then
the party you always wanted.

19:38.547 --> 19:39.921
That was the plan.

19:41.420 --> 19:42.499
Well...

19:42.988 --> 19:44.884
That I might have liked.

19:46.892 --> 19:50.037
Look, I'm sorry, but I just can't do this.

19:50.038 --> 19:51.234
I'm not done.

19:51.235 --> 19:53.431
Oh, really? What else do you have planned?

19:55.508 --> 19:57.745
This may be the dumbest
thing I've ever done.

20:09.879 --> 20:11.530
Okay.

20:11.531 --> 20:12.819
Officially...

20:13.336 --> 20:15.172
The best birthday ever.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.671
Happy Birthday, Riley.

20:20.337 --> 20:21.468
Angela?

20:21.469 --> 20:22.520
Hi, Ben.

20:22.859 --> 20:24.323
What are you doing here?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.546
I couldn't do it.

20:25.547 --> 20:26.729
Once your mom showed me her picture,

20:26.730 --> 20:27.964
I couldn't walk away again.

20:28.548 --> 20:31.452
I'm sorry, but I think I want Emma back.

20:48.303 --> 20:49.481
So you're actually okay

20:49.482 --> 20:51.281
with your brother and Riley being together?

20:52.873 --> 20:54.256
Yeah.

20:54.257 --> 20:55.674
Why wouldn't I be?

20:56.114 --> 20:57.461
It was kinda my idea.

20:58.904 --> 21:01.070
Look, I'm really sorry about you and Amy.

21:02.985 --> 21:05.585
Yeah. Me too.

21:06.211 --> 21:07.883
I just she would have broken up with me

21:07.884 --> 21:09.906
before I got this.
