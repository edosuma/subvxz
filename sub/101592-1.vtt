00:50.615 --> 00:53.018
<i>I didn't really have
your typical upbringing.</i>

00:53.152 --> 00:56.789
<i>I mean, I did at first,
but then the world ended.</i>

00:56.921 --> 00:58.590
<i>I don't think anyone
was really shocked.</i>

00:58.723 --> 01:02.126
<i>We always thought it might,
and then it just finally happened.</i>

01:02.259 --> 01:05.932
<i>But how it happened,
now that's where it gets interesting.</i>

01:06.531 --> 01:07.833
<i>Agatha 616.</i>

01:07.965 --> 01:10.434
<i>Yep, an asteroid
heading straight for Earth.</i>

01:10.569 --> 01:12.237
<i>I know. So obvious.</i>

01:12.370 --> 01:14.906
<i>So, humanity came together,
and we did what we do best.</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:16.575
<i>We shot a bunch
of rockets at it!</i>

01:16.707 --> 01:18.843
<i>And we blew it up!
And it was great!</i>

01:18.977 --> 01:22.112
<i>But it wasn't. You see,
the thing that makes rockets rockets...</i>

01:22.246 --> 01:23.816
<i>chemical compounds,
a lot of 'em.</i>

01:23.948 --> 01:27.319
<i>Which rained back down on us,
and everything changed.</i>

01:27.451 --> 01:29.820
<i>And by "everything,"
I mean cold-blooded creatures.</i>

01:29.954 --> 01:33.290
<i>And by "changed," I mean mutated
and started eating us to death.</i>

01:34.793 --> 01:39.031
<i>Ants, lizards, roaches, crocodiles.
You name it. There's a lot of 'em.</i>

01:44.102 --> 01:47.705
<i>I knew this one kid who was eaten in his
sleep by a goldfish he won at a carnival.</i>

01:47.838 --> 01:50.242
<i>Man, Todd loved that goldfish.</i>

01:51.775 --> 01:54.111
<i>And that cat.</i>

01:54.245 --> 01:57.015
<i>So, for most of human history,
if you wanted to kill a cockroach,</i>

01:57.149 --> 01:58.551
<i>all you needed was a shoe.</i>

01:58.683 --> 02:00.551
<i>Well, suddenly
you needed a shotgun.</i>

02:00.686 --> 02:02.821
<i>And sometimes even a tank.</i>

02:02.954 --> 02:04.822
<i>And sometimes
even that doesn't work.</i>

02:04.956 --> 02:08.326
<i>Especially if you don't stay
in the tank, Bob.</i>

02:09.762 --> 02:13.264
<i>Eventually, the really big ones and
our military took each other out.</i>

02:14.532 --> 02:19.304
<i>We lost 95% of the human
population in about a year.</i>

02:19.437 --> 02:21.238
<i>That's a lot of Bobs.</i>

02:21.372 --> 02:22.506
<i>And a lot of Todds.</i>

02:23.608 --> 02:27.079
<i>Those of us who survived,
we hid anywhere we could...</i>

02:27.211 --> 02:30.881
<i>bunkers, caves, panic rooms,
all around the world.</i>

02:31.015 --> 02:34.852
<i>So for the last seven years I've
been living in an underground bunker.</i>

02:35.820 --> 02:38.022
<i>It's not as bad
as it sounds. Really.</i>

02:38.157 --> 02:41.527
<i>It's a great group of people,
and we all love each other.</i>

02:41.659 --> 02:44.996
<i>It's kinda what I imagined
college would have been like.</i>

02:45.131 --> 02:48.300
Are you sure he's asleep?

02:48.432 --> 02:49.935
Who?

02:50.068 --> 02:52.304
- Joel. Who else?
- Yeah. He's asleep.

02:52.437 --> 02:55.140
- Hang on. Shh.
- He's not awake.

02:55.274 --> 02:56.907
- Are you sure?
- It's just you.

02:57.042 --> 02:58.843
I just... I don't...

02:58.978 --> 03:01.379
Joel. Joel.

03:02.146 --> 03:04.917
See?
He's not awake.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.850
It's just you.

03:06.985 --> 03:09.288
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am wide awake.</i>

03:09.420 --> 03:12.691
<i>I've just gotten good at not
really moving or breathing.</i>

03:14.592 --> 03:16.429
<i>Being stuck in a survival
bunker with a bunch of people</i>

03:16.562 --> 03:19.831
<i>who have all found their
soul mate is less than ideal.</i>

03:19.965 --> 03:22.366
<i>Karen and Ray got together
a few months ago,</i>

03:22.500 --> 03:24.536
<i>so they're still kinda
in their honeymoon phase.</i>

03:24.669 --> 03:27.506
<i>It is super physical.</i>

03:27.639 --> 03:31.777
<i>Good for them. They're both very
attractive and apparently quite flexible.</i>

03:31.909 --> 03:34.478
<i>Hey, life's short.
Especially down here.</i>

03:34.612 --> 03:36.448
- Oh. Hey, Ava.
- Hey, Joel.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.751
- Joel. How's it going?
- It's going good, Tim.

03:39.884 --> 03:42.721
- How are you... How are you doing?
- Yeah, good.

03:42.854 --> 03:44.155
Cool.

03:45.189 --> 03:47.658
- I couldn't sleep.
- Yeah, we know the feeling.

03:47.793 --> 03:50.295
Yeah. Probably not
for the same reasons.

03:50.429 --> 03:54.199
Y-You guys's, uh, door's open.
Is that... Did you know that?

03:54.332 --> 03:56.268
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we know.

03:56.868 --> 03:58.402
Okay.

03:58.537 --> 04:00.139
<i>After Tim's parents were
eaten by a swarm of termites,</i>

04:00.271 --> 04:02.807
- <i>he and Ava became inseparable.</i>
- Okay. Good night.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.742
- <i>In every way.</i>
- Good night.

04:04.877 --> 04:08.781
That's the asteroid
they named 616 Agatha.

04:08.913 --> 04:11.716
And these are all the chemical
bombs they sent up to try and...

04:11.849 --> 04:14.319
<i>So, pretty much
everyone's coupled up down here.</i>

04:14.453 --> 04:17.723
<i>Our first baby was born last winter.
It was super emotional.</i>

04:17.855 --> 04:19.625
<i>Welcome to the apocalypse, kid.</i>

04:19.757 --> 04:22.026
<i>The food sucks. At least you'll
never know what you're missing.</i>

04:22.161 --> 04:25.530
<i>Kala and Connor got together
after Carol died.</i>

04:25.663 --> 04:28.733
<i>Carol was a cow who ate a
box of laundry detergent.</i>

04:28.867 --> 04:32.304
<i>And now we only have one cow.</i>

04:32.437 --> 04:33.672
<i>Her name's Gertie.</i>

04:33.805 --> 04:35.274
<i>Gertie is great.</i>

04:36.440 --> 04:38.175
<i>Gertie's not
our only food source.</i>

04:38.310 --> 04:40.079
<i>We actually have a hunting
party that brings back</i>

04:40.211 --> 04:41.947
<i>whatever they can
from the surface.</i>

04:42.079 --> 04:46.151
<i>It was easier in the beginning, you
know, before we ran out of bullets.</i>

04:46.283 --> 04:48.887
<i>Facing down one of those things
with a janky handmade weapon</i>

04:49.021 --> 04:50.989
<i>is no walk in the park.</i>

04:51.122 --> 04:52.324
<i>Or so they tell me.</i>

04:52.456 --> 04:55.060
<i>I-I don't go
on the hunting parties.</i>

04:55.192 --> 04:57.161
<i>They need me in the kitchen.
I'm kinda the, uh...</i>

04:57.295 --> 04:59.129
<i>...the chef of the bunker.</i>

04:59.264 --> 05:01.066
<i>Everyone likes my minestrone.</i>

05:02.466 --> 05:06.069
<i>Being the only single person in
the bunker has its perks too.</i>

05:06.204 --> 05:07.673
<i>I get to hang out with Mavis.</i>

05:07.805 --> 05:11.276
<i>Of course, she's not much
for conversation anymore.</i>

05:11.410 --> 05:14.846
<i>Her core battery's shot,
just like every other Mavis, I'd imagine.</i>

05:14.980 --> 05:16.849
<i>Actually never seen
a working one.</i>

05:30.327 --> 05:32.362
<i>Sure wish you were here, Aimee.</i>

05:32.497 --> 05:34.699
<i>I'd love for you
to meet everyone.</i>

05:34.833 --> 05:36.301
Oh, yeah.

05:36.434 --> 05:38.903
<i>Maybe we could do a little
target practice together.</i>

05:39.036 --> 05:40.839
<i>It's kinda my thing.</i>

05:41.639 --> 05:43.209
<i>Well...</i>

05:45.276 --> 05:47.345
Sorry, Mavis.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.891
Hustle, hustle, people.
We gotta move.

06:01.024 --> 06:03.596
Guys!

06:04.963 --> 06:07.366
Guys! I got the weapons.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.368
- Stay.
- What?

06:10.499 --> 06:11.469
- Get what you need, and let's go.
- What's happening?

06:11.603 --> 06:12.638
What's going on?

06:12.771 --> 06:14.538
- We're breached.
- Breached?

06:14.673 --> 06:16.240
- Joel.
- What do you mean?

06:16.374 --> 06:17.676
Like,
inside the bunker breached?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.377
That's what "breached"
means, kiddo.

06:21.779 --> 06:23.547
Breached.

06:24.682 --> 06:27.485
Anna Lucia and I will engage.
Anderson and Tim, flank us.

06:27.619 --> 06:30.889
Flank 'em, yeah, okay.
Where do you guys need me? The rear, or...

06:31.021 --> 06:32.257
I thought
we were past this, Joel.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.859
Past what?
You need help. I can help.

06:33.992 --> 06:35.994
- Let me help.
- You gonna make me say it?

06:36.127 --> 06:38.663
- Say what?
- You can't handle it, Joel.

06:38.797 --> 06:40.665
- You're shook.
- Okay, yeah.

06:40.798 --> 06:43.435
- So, you guys don't get scared ever?
- We get scared.

06:43.567 --> 06:46.237
We all get scared, Joel,
but you get really scared.

06:46.370 --> 06:48.539
- We're not trying to make you feel bad.
- We love you, Joel.

06:48.673 --> 06:49.907
But you're unsafe.

06:50.041 --> 06:52.443
- You're a liability.
- Even on supply runs.

06:52.576 --> 06:54.446
Okay, why did that speech
feel so rehearsed?

06:57.048 --> 06:58.149
Connor.

06:58.283 --> 07:01.186
Okay, 30 meters out. Let's move.

07:08.026 --> 07:10.996
- Be careful, Connor-Bear.
- I will, Kala-Bee.

07:18.803 --> 07:20.505
Load out.

07:24.074 --> 07:26.077
Go with them.

07:35.887 --> 07:37.622
They're getting close.

07:43.327 --> 07:45.162
Shit.

07:45.297 --> 07:46.798
Oh, my God.

07:46.932 --> 07:49.468
- It's got one of 'em.
- What about the others?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.002
They're coming back.

07:51.136 --> 07:52.204
Joel!

07:52.336 --> 07:54.738
They need help. I'm going.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.975
Joel! Wait!

08:51.028 --> 08:53.264
Connor?

08:54.633 --> 08:55.667
Connor.

09:58.062 --> 10:00.298
Did I shoot it, or did you?

10:01.667 --> 10:03.235
What do you think?

10:05.035 --> 10:06.370
You.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.910
<i>Oh, and I have a pretty
severe freezing problem.</i>

10:13.044 --> 10:14.712
<i>But I am working on it.</i>

10:27.926 --> 10:30.562
- How is it looking?
- I think it looks really good.

10:30.695 --> 10:32.263
- Does it look like me?
- Yeah.

10:32.397 --> 10:35.834
Are you sure that
this pose looks natural?

10:35.966 --> 10:37.335
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

10:37.467 --> 10:39.437
I think it's really good.

10:39.571 --> 10:41.339
What are you doing?
Don't move.

10:41.471 --> 10:43.908
- Will you let me see it?
- Don't... Don't move. Aimee.

10:44.042 --> 10:45.377
I really wanna see it.

10:45.509 --> 10:47.077
Can I see it?

10:47.211 --> 10:49.313
Okay.

10:50.081 --> 10:51.014
Okay.

10:51.149 --> 10:52.884
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.856 --> 11:00.158
What do you think?

11:01.493 --> 11:04.463
Why do I have a beard?

11:04.596 --> 11:06.465
No, that's shading.
I did the shading.

11:06.597 --> 11:09.233
My head is... is so large.

11:09.366 --> 11:12.737
- You have a big head.
- And my hand is so tiny.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.404
You have tiny hands.

11:15.105 --> 11:17.075
I love it. I frickin' love it.

11:17.207 --> 11:20.577
That's super sweet, 'cause it's terrible.

11:20.711 --> 11:22.646
- I got you something too.
- What?

11:22.780 --> 11:26.650
I don't know if
these are the right ones.

11:26.784 --> 11:30.053
No way. These are the ones
that I-I-I wanted to get.

11:30.187 --> 11:31.557
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:34.025 --> 11:36.127
Ooh. Hello.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.895
- What's happening right now?
- Uh...

11:38.028 --> 11:41.032
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm dancing with my shoulders.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.734
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

11:58.549 --> 12:00.885
This has been the best summer
of my life.

12:01.852 --> 12:03.287
Mine too.

12:07.859 --> 12:08.793
Uh-oh.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.695
What are you doing?

12:10.828 --> 12:14.965
- Do you know what time it is?
- Uh, I think it's, like, 6:30.

12:15.100 --> 12:18.302
Aimee, you're...
you're scaring Crocodile Carl.

12:18.436 --> 12:20.405
Okay, look away, Crocodile Carl.

12:20.538 --> 12:23.240
Oh. Look away.
Hey, I get it.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.875
I get it.

12:36.386 --> 12:37.989
We need to go.

12:38.956 --> 12:40.524
I'm scared.

12:55.706 --> 12:59.110
<i>Dear Aimee, This week
has been especially shitty.</i>

12:59.244 --> 13:02.681
<i>We lost Connor to what
looked like a really big ant.</i>

13:05.549 --> 13:07.418
<i>Helps me to draw them.</i>

13:07.552 --> 13:09.486
<i>I try to capture their essence,</i>

13:09.620 --> 13:12.057
<i>scribble down some notes
on how to kill them.</i>

13:14.158 --> 13:15.526
<i>Sometimes I think
it's the only way I know</i>

13:15.659 --> 13:17.461
<i>how to cope with these things.</i>

13:23.033 --> 13:25.702
This is 7045. Come in, 3022.

13:25.836 --> 13:28.706
I repeat, come in, 3022. Over.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.642
<i>This is 3022.
What is it now, Ray?</i>

13:31.775 --> 13:34.945
Hey, Janice. No, it's actually...
It's, uh, Joel.

13:35.846 --> 13:38.482
- <i>Oh. Joel.</i>
- Yeah.

13:38.616 --> 13:40.418
<i>All right.
Hold on one second.</i>

13:40.551 --> 13:42.552
<i>Aimee, it's Ray!</i>

13:42.687 --> 13:45.023
It's Joel.
Thanks, Janice.

13:46.724 --> 13:49.394
- <i>Joel! Hey!</i>
- Hey, Aimee! Hi!

13:49.528 --> 13:51.763
- How are you?
- <i>Hi. Yeah, I, uh... I'm good.</i>

13:51.895 --> 13:54.932
- It's so good to hear your voice.
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

13:55.066 --> 13:58.336
<i>I heard on the open frequency
that one of you guys got killed.</i>

13:58.469 --> 14:00.504
Yeah. Breached the bunker.

14:00.638 --> 14:02.940
<i>Wow. Actually got inside?</i>

14:03.073 --> 14:07.010
Yeah. It's the first time it's happened.
It was kinda scary.

14:07.144 --> 14:09.346
<i>Did you have to fight it too?</i>

14:09.480 --> 14:11.817
Yeah. Yeah, a little.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.052
I had to fight it
a little bit.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.820
Actually got super ripped since
the last time you saw me, so...

14:16.955 --> 14:19.424
<i>Oh. Wow!</i>
<i>Super ripped, huh?</i>

14:19.557 --> 14:24.128
Yeah, I was kidding. I'm not super ripped.
That was just a bad joke.

14:24.261 --> 14:26.497
<i>Well, I'm glad you're okay.</i>

14:27.298 --> 14:29.466
Thanks. Yeah.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.204
<i>I am still kinda blown away that you were
even able to find my colony on this thing.</i>

14:33.337 --> 14:34.871
I know.
It's pretty crazy.

14:35.005 --> 14:37.775
'Cause I found it on the first one.
What are the odds?

14:37.908 --> 14:39.543
<i>Crazy.</i>

14:39.677 --> 14:43.281
Yeah. No, I... I called...
I called, like, 90.

14:45.115 --> 14:49.354
- Hey, you know what I, uh... know what I wish sometimes?
- <i>What?</i>

14:49.486 --> 14:53.924
That I could, like, s-snap my fingers
and be back in that car with you.

14:56.293 --> 14:57.728
Man, that'd be nice.

14:57.861 --> 15:00.397
<i>Yeah. Too bad it's, uh...</i>

15:00.530 --> 15:03.734
<i>you know, impossible.</i>

15:03.868 --> 15:06.905
<i>Kinda feels like everything
is impossible these days.</i>

15:07.038 --> 15:10.808
<i>Taking care of this whole
colony is exhausting.</i>

15:12.409 --> 15:14.846
I, uh...
I-I write you letters.

15:16.147 --> 15:17.516
<i>Really?</i>

15:18.850 --> 15:21.485
Yeah. Yeah,
I-I write you letters sometimes.

15:21.619 --> 15:23.855
- <i>Aw!</i>
- All the time.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.157
<i>I'd love to read 'em.</i>

15:26.291 --> 15:29.127
Really? I would love to read them to...

15:29.260 --> 15:32.062
No. Aimee?

15:34.264 --> 15:36.599
Aimee?

15:46.977 --> 15:49.814
<i>We've lost
a lot of people over the years.</i>

15:52.015 --> 15:55.120
<i>You'd think you'd get numb
to it after a certain point.</i>

15:58.288 --> 15:59.723
<i>You don't.</i>

16:05.796 --> 16:08.299
- I'm sorry.
- Thank God! Where have you been, Joel?

16:08.432 --> 16:11.501
We have to go right now.
Say your goodbyes, get in the car.

16:11.635 --> 16:13.304
- I should go.
- Maybe you should come with us.

16:13.437 --> 16:16.908
No, my mom is waiting. I'm sorry.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.210
Get in the car!
Aimee, you need to hurry home now!

16:19.342 --> 16:21.779
- I want you to have this.
- What? This is Crocodile Carl.

16:21.913 --> 16:23.346
It's your good luck charm.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.216
- Be careful.
- You too.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.027
Aimee.

16:38.028 --> 16:39.264
I love you.

16:41.097 --> 16:42.199
I love you too.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.002
I'm gonna come find you.

16:46.136 --> 16:47.605
You better.

16:57.048 --> 16:58.548
<i>You better.</i>

16:58.682 --> 17:00.350
I wanna know how it got in.

17:00.484 --> 17:03.321
It appears to have ripped
through one of our perimeter defenses.

17:03.455 --> 17:04.923
What,
it ripped through steel?

17:05.056 --> 17:06.923
Anderson and I resealed
the breach point and the vent.

17:07.057 --> 17:08.358
Nothing's getting
in that way again.

17:08.492 --> 17:09.594
But why did it happen?

17:09.727 --> 17:10.961
It was a freak occurrence.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.630
There's no reason to think
it'll happen again.

17:12.762 --> 17:16.199
We should try to stay calm.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.137
How far away is Aimee's colony?

17:19.836 --> 17:21.972
- What?
- Aimee's colony.

17:22.707 --> 17:25.377
- How far away is it?
- About 85 miles.

17:25.509 --> 17:26.778
How long does that take
to get there?

17:26.911 --> 17:28.813
You're not actually thinking
of going?

17:28.945 --> 17:31.782
Tim, just... humor me.

17:32.483 --> 17:36.153
- How long?
- Seven days. Minimum.

17:36.288 --> 17:40.325
An armed and trained hunting party would
be lucky to last 50 miles on the surface.

17:40.458 --> 17:41.826
But you, Joel...

17:42.559 --> 17:45.028
All right, now I need volunteers

17:45.163 --> 17:47.163
to help reinforce
some of the outer perimeter.

17:47.298 --> 17:50.634
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

17:50.768 --> 17:52.202
- Ava's got this.
- Exactly.

17:52.336 --> 17:53.738
I'm gonna go.

17:56.574 --> 17:59.144
It's an impossible journey,
Joel.

18:01.545 --> 18:03.214
No, I'm serious.

18:05.316 --> 18:08.318
I love you guys,
but there's one person in this world

18:08.452 --> 18:10.320
who ever truly made me happy,

18:10.454 --> 18:12.656
and she's only 85 miles away.

18:12.789 --> 18:14.893
And I'm gonna go see her.

18:16.961 --> 18:18.096
Whew.

18:18.896 --> 18:20.097
That felt awesome.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.866
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am done hiding.</i>

18:23.000 --> 18:25.068
<i>I'm done waiting
for things to get better.</i>

18:25.202 --> 18:27.904
<i>It's time to take matters
into my own hands.</i>

18:28.038 --> 18:30.875
<i>Time to let someone else
make the minestrone.</i>

18:32.042 --> 18:34.711
<i>I'm taking a radio, even though
it doesn't have power.</i>

18:34.846 --> 18:36.381
<i>But I'm gonna take it anyway.</i>

18:37.315 --> 18:39.283
Wish me luck, Gertie.

18:39.416 --> 18:41.451
Mavis, take care of her.

18:41.586 --> 18:43.688
You're not joking,
are you?

18:44.288 --> 18:46.057
Nope. Nope, I'm not.

18:46.723 --> 18:48.092
He's not joking.

18:48.226 --> 18:50.962
We're not letting you leave,
Joel. You're needed here.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.964
Tim, no, I'm not. Come on.
I don't do anything.

18:54.098 --> 18:58.403
Joel, that's not true. You fix the radio.
You make the minestrone.

19:00.171 --> 19:01.706
Okay.

19:01.838 --> 19:03.707
Doesn't sound as important
when I say it out loud.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.675
I appreciate you trying.
Really, I do.

19:05.809 --> 19:08.111
I just don't feel like
I belong anywhere.

19:08.246 --> 19:11.682
I don't really wanna die all alone
at the end of the world, so...

19:16.787 --> 19:22.125
Look, I know you guys all just think
of me as, like, some little, pathetic,

19:22.626 --> 19:24.461
adorable hedgehog.

19:24.595 --> 19:26.096
But I can take care of myself.

19:26.230 --> 19:29.334
I'm actually probably a lot
stronger than you might think.

19:31.234 --> 19:34.238
- We made you a map.
- Thanks, Karen.

19:38.509 --> 19:40.577
Just... take care.

19:40.711 --> 19:43.881
- Everything will try to kill you.
- Oh.

19:44.013 --> 19:46.183
Be observant.
Use the advantages that you have.

19:46.317 --> 19:48.719
- You're fast and small, so...
- Right.

19:48.853 --> 19:51.722
- Don't fight. Just run and hide.
- Don't fight.

19:53.657 --> 19:55.225
Thanks, Ray.

19:56.326 --> 19:58.829
You're an asshole
if you get eaten.

20:06.569 --> 20:09.139
- Okay.
- Nice.

20:10.207 --> 20:12.376
I love you guys. Tell Aimee
I'll see her in seven days.

20:12.509 --> 20:14.878
- We believe in you.
- Love you, buddy.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.663
Where am I?

21:05.797 --> 21:07.964
Well, it's not super useful.

21:08.531 --> 21:09.666
Okay, well, you know what?

21:09.799 --> 21:12.269
We know we gotta head west.
Right?

21:13.003 --> 21:15.772
Well, let's just... do that.

21:15.905 --> 21:18.143
Start with something easy. West.

21:21.144 --> 21:23.381
Nope, it's this way.
West is this way.

21:29.753 --> 21:31.288
Shit.

21:31.422 --> 21:34.092
Split the difference.
Go this way.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.060
Done. First decision made.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.882
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am doing it.</i>

21:59.016 --> 22:00.618
<i>I'm really doing it!</i>

22:00.751 --> 22:04.055
<i>Honestly, I thought it'd be way worse.
So far, it's not too bad.</i>

22:04.188 --> 22:07.692
<i>I've seen a lot of signs
of death, but no actual death.</i>

22:07.825 --> 22:09.561
<i>So cross your fingers.</i>

22:11.327 --> 22:12.896
Oh.

22:13.029 --> 22:14.298
Monster eggs.

22:14.432 --> 22:16.599
<i>Trying to stay positive.
Weather's nice.</i>

22:16.732 --> 22:20.337
<i>Getting some fresh air.
What else can I tell ya?</i>

22:23.942 --> 22:25.276
Cool.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.879
Wham-O...

22:29.012 --> 22:32.081
No.

22:32.215 --> 22:34.817
Run and hide.

22:34.951 --> 22:38.355
Hide in the house.
Hide in the house.

24:06.977 --> 24:08.879
No.

24:09.011 --> 24:11.182
No, no, no. No!

24:11.315 --> 24:14.085
No!

24:14.618 --> 24:17.320
No, no, no!

24:17.454 --> 24:20.457
Yes! Bite it! Bite it off!

24:34.372 --> 24:36.908
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

24:37.040 --> 24:38.675
Where are you going?

24:49.519 --> 24:51.054
Whoa!

24:51.188 --> 24:53.124
Whoa, that was so cool.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.296
Nice place.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.400
Can I sit?

25:06.136 --> 25:07.437
Thanks.

25:12.576 --> 25:13.876
You all alone?

25:14.010 --> 25:15.778
Yeah.

25:15.913 --> 25:17.280
Me too.

25:23.053 --> 25:25.356
Boy?

25:25.490 --> 25:28.726
Is that your name?
Boy? Your name is Boy.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.429
I'm Joel.

25:32.296 --> 25:34.065
Nice to meet ya.

25:35.165 --> 25:38.702
Thanks, uh...
Thanks for saving my life, Boy.

25:45.541 --> 25:48.211
Is this a dress?

25:48.345 --> 25:51.114
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry.

25:51.248 --> 25:53.451
Okay, I won't touch it again.

25:55.751 --> 25:58.387
Was that your owner's?

25:58.521 --> 26:01.091
It's okay.
You don't have to talk about it.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.793
Sorry.

26:04.428 --> 26:06.831
Wait. Did you think I was her?

26:07.765 --> 26:08.632
Huh.

26:08.766 --> 26:11.502
I'm gonna lie down too.
Is that o...

26:12.568 --> 26:15.673
No, it's okay.
Just my backpack.

26:25.682 --> 26:27.918
You know,
I had a girl, too, once.

26:28.051 --> 26:31.020
Think you would've really liked her.
Yeah, you guys would totally get along.

26:31.153 --> 26:34.825
She loves dogs. I mean, all animals.
She's a big animal lover.

26:35.592 --> 26:37.862
I haven't seen her
in seven years.

26:37.994 --> 26:41.298
Long time. That's why
I'm trying to go find her.

26:42.499 --> 26:45.870
I haven't told anyone this,
but I'm kinda nervous about it.

26:54.911 --> 26:56.647
Good night, Boy.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.901
Weakness: dogs.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.439
That's you.

27:21.571 --> 27:25.107
You wouldn't happen to have a power
source to a ham radio in here, would you?

27:25.241 --> 27:26.844
'Cause I have a...

27:27.310 --> 27:28.545
Never mind.

27:37.121 --> 27:39.456
Huh. Lipstick.

27:39.589 --> 27:40.691
Aimee.

27:41.491 --> 27:43.626
Hey, would you mind
if I kept this?

27:43.760 --> 27:44.795
Thanks.

27:45.395 --> 27:48.097
All right, well... this is it.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.166
Thanks for having me.

27:50.299 --> 27:53.903
I should...
stop talking to a dog.

27:55.239 --> 27:57.807
Okay. I'll see ya.

28:08.285 --> 28:09.753
Okay.

28:13.457 --> 28:14.658
Oh.

28:14.790 --> 28:17.127
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no. None of that.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.329
Something might hear you.

28:19.997 --> 28:21.865
You wanna come with me?

28:22.532 --> 28:24.634
Okay. You can come.

28:25.336 --> 28:26.804
Let's go. Come on.

28:27.904 --> 28:29.472
Uh... What...

28:31.141 --> 28:35.778
Yeah, we can bring that.
You want me to put it in my bag?

28:38.080 --> 28:41.150
Okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna keep it safe. I promise.

28:43.019 --> 28:45.256
Going in the safe backpack.

28:46.088 --> 28:47.191
See?

28:47.324 --> 28:48.859
Okay, you ready?

28:49.559 --> 28:52.128
Let's go. Come on.

28:52.262 --> 28:54.831
Okay, that's really
gonna have to stop.

28:58.499 --> 28:59.971
Feels good, actually,
having company.

29:18.788 --> 29:20.624
<i>Dear Aimee, Guess what.</i>

29:20.757 --> 29:23.794
<i>I got a dog, and he's the coolest.
His name is Boy.</i>

29:23.928 --> 29:25.629
<i>He saved my life
from a giant frog in a pool</i>

29:25.761 --> 29:27.764
<i>who tried to eat me
with his tongue.</i>

29:27.897 --> 29:30.699
<i>And then we hung out on his bus.
Man, do we make a great team.</i>

29:32.035 --> 29:33.903
<i>We found out we have
a ton in common too.</i>

29:34.037 --> 29:36.105
<i>I feel like
we can talk about anything.</i>

29:37.273 --> 29:40.209
<i>You gotta see us out here.
We're like this iconic duo.</i>

29:40.343 --> 29:43.980
<i>I don't know. Feels like when
we're together, we're unstoppable.</i>

29:44.115 --> 29:47.084
Hey. What are you doing?
What you got in there?

29:48.618 --> 29:50.319
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Go. Go!

29:50.452 --> 29:52.455
We gotta go! Come on!

29:59.362 --> 30:02.333
Berries.

30:02.465 --> 30:05.269
Sustenance. Perfect.

30:05.402 --> 30:06.769
Ow. Ow!

30:06.903 --> 30:10.441
Ow! What... What are you doing?

30:11.340 --> 30:13.176
Uh...

30:14.711 --> 30:16.547
But they look so good.

30:20.183 --> 30:22.720
Yeah, you know what?
I don't think I should eat these.

30:22.853 --> 30:26.256
<i>It's crazy the things you forget
about the world. Like the smells.</i>

30:26.390 --> 30:28.425
<i>The grass,
the trees, the flowers.</i>

30:28.557 --> 30:30.661
<i>Sure, you get the occasional
bloody corpse, but...</i>

30:30.795 --> 30:31.829
Aaah!

30:52.348 --> 30:54.617
Oh, no.
I fell in a hole.

30:54.751 --> 30:56.854
Okay, I just gotta...

30:58.154 --> 30:59.455
climb out.

30:59.588 --> 31:01.424
I can climb out.

31:11.499 --> 31:12.036
Oh, no.

31:13.470 --> 31:14.872
This is bad.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.275
Oh, this is so bad.

31:18.409 --> 31:20.511
Stop. Stop it. Shh. Stop it.

32:10.426 --> 32:12.428
It's a rope, you numbskull!

32:12.563 --> 32:15.099
Put it around your foot
and grab on!

32:15.231 --> 32:17.634
Okay, come on! Hold on!

32:17.768 --> 32:20.170
Pull up!

32:28.479 --> 32:31.782
You wanna look at 'em? Oh, shit!

32:33.616 --> 32:35.920
Uh...

32:36.586 --> 32:38.221
Minnow, finish 'em off.

32:39.623 --> 32:42.859
One, two, three, four and...

32:46.262 --> 32:48.531
Are we...

32:49.932 --> 32:51.769
Always count to five.

32:51.902 --> 32:53.670
Was that a samurai sword?

32:53.804 --> 32:55.672
Why'd you fall
into a Sandgobbler's nest?

32:55.805 --> 32:58.741
I didn't mean to, you know.
I was just... I was walking.

32:58.875 --> 33:01.110
- What's your name?
- Joel.

33:01.244 --> 33:02.512
Joel Dawson.

33:02.645 --> 33:04.280
I'm, uh, Clyde.
This is Minnow.

33:04.413 --> 33:07.283
You're lucky we weren't monsters.
You were yelling like a girl.

33:07.416 --> 33:09.485
"This is bad! This is so bad!"

33:09.619 --> 33:13.556
Okay, I don't sound like that.
My voice is not that high-pitched.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.558
- Yeah, it is.
- Yes, it is.

33:15.692 --> 33:17.861
It was higher than mine,
and I'm eight.

33:17.993 --> 33:21.531
What in God's name are you
doing up here alone anyway?

33:21.664 --> 33:23.766
I'm not alone. I've got Boy too.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.802
Oh, wait, no! No, wait, wait!

33:25.935 --> 33:28.672
Oh, my God, it's a puppy!

33:28.806 --> 33:30.841
Come here, Boy!
Come here, Boy!

33:30.973 --> 33:33.876
- They almost killed my dog.
- Hi, Boy!

33:34.010 --> 33:35.913
Hi!

33:36.046 --> 33:37.581
Hey.

33:37.713 --> 33:40.582
So, uh, what happened
with your colony, man?

33:40.717 --> 33:42.185
They kick you out?

33:42.318 --> 33:44.320
No, I actually left on my own.

33:44.453 --> 33:47.190
- Something I had to do.
- You stole food, didn't you?

33:47.324 --> 33:48.792
- He's a food stealer.
- Yeah.

33:48.924 --> 33:52.361
- No, I didn't steal any food.
- Right.

33:52.494 --> 33:55.064
Me and my colony were really close.
Like family. Okay?

33:55.198 --> 33:57.201
They were super upset
that I left.

34:01.605 --> 34:03.640
- Time to go, Minnow.
- Time to go? Why?

34:03.773 --> 34:05.875
So, what...

34:06.009 --> 34:08.143
What, uh... What was that?
What's going on?

34:08.277 --> 34:11.648
- Could've been a lot of things.
- Tree Flamer. Herd Stomper.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.215
Rockdiver.

34:13.349 --> 34:17.253
Limbsnapper. Limbcrusher.
And my favorite... the Chumbler.

34:17.387 --> 34:20.590
Okay, I get it.
A lot of... A lot of names.

34:20.724 --> 34:24.327
Whatever it is,
it took your screams for the dinner bell.

34:24.460 --> 34:27.596
If it's got your scent,
it's gonna be on you for a while.

34:27.731 --> 34:31.335
Hey, maybe I could, like,
I don't know, come with you guys.

34:36.172 --> 34:38.041
Which way you headed?

34:38.742 --> 34:40.409
Going west.

34:40.543 --> 34:42.978
To the coast. Jenner Beach.

34:43.112 --> 34:45.380
Yeah. We're not
cutting north just yet.

34:45.514 --> 34:48.817
- Not cu... Not cutting north just yet.
- Come on. Come on.

34:48.952 --> 34:50.987
Yeah. Whatever you want.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.222
You guys want me
to come, I'll come.

34:53.356 --> 34:55.224
Come on.

35:14.878 --> 35:17.847
That's a good, uh...
good little workout.

35:19.548 --> 35:21.585
A girl, huh?

35:21.717 --> 35:23.286
Yeah.

35:23.420 --> 35:25.855
You left a nice, safe colony to
travel all the way to the ocean

35:25.989 --> 35:29.393
for a girl you ain't seen
since you were, what, 17?

35:29.525 --> 35:32.862
No, I know what you're thinking.
I know how it sounds. It's crazy.

35:32.996 --> 35:34.530
But... I don't know.

35:34.664 --> 35:37.534
If you knew our connection,
you'd probably feel differently.

35:37.666 --> 35:40.503
We actually just got back in touch
over the radio a few weeks ago.

35:40.637 --> 35:43.740
And it's still there.
It's just magical. And so sweet.

35:43.873 --> 35:47.109
She loves me too, so a "pick up right
where we left off" kind of thing.

35:47.242 --> 35:50.413
- It's still there.
- You ever hear the term "fool's errand"?

35:50.547 --> 35:53.884
All right, what, so I'm a fool
because I believe in true love?

35:54.016 --> 35:56.285
No, you're a fool
because you're out here alone,

35:56.420 --> 35:58.856
you don't know a thing
about survival...

36:00.356 --> 36:01.291
Wind.

36:01.423 --> 36:03.126
...you shoot for shit,

36:03.259 --> 36:07.730
yet you got an attitude like
you're some kind of noble warrior

36:07.864 --> 36:10.099
floating on the wings of love.

36:10.233 --> 36:13.502
- Doesn't work like that.
- Okay.

36:13.635 --> 36:16.105
Super encouraging speech.

36:23.512 --> 36:24.847
- Damn it.
- You're braining out.

36:24.981 --> 36:27.918
- Huh?
- Braining out. Thinking too much.

36:28.052 --> 36:31.355
I always clear my mind
and say to myself,

36:31.487 --> 36:32.623
"a needle through water."

36:32.755 --> 36:34.257
"A needle through water"?

36:34.391 --> 36:37.494
Trust me. My dad was the
best archer in my colony.

36:37.628 --> 36:41.864
Oh, really? Okay. Then how come he's
not the one giving me the lessons?

36:41.998 --> 36:43.499
'Cause I'm not her dad.

36:43.632 --> 36:45.601
Yeah, my dad got killed.

36:45.735 --> 36:47.871
Back when we lived
in the subway station.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.539
Along with Elliot.

36:49.672 --> 36:51.440
Uh, wh-who's Elliot?

36:51.574 --> 36:52.909
My son.

36:53.876 --> 36:56.847
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No need to be sorry.

36:57.981 --> 37:00.317
We all have stories like that.
Don't we?

37:06.956 --> 37:08.358
Needle through water.

37:09.858 --> 37:11.894
Needle through water.

37:15.731 --> 37:17.733
Hey, that was pretty close.

37:17.867 --> 37:20.203
- It was better.
- It was really good, right?

37:21.170 --> 37:22.638
Right?

37:22.771 --> 37:26.543
Tell you what, kid. You gonna hang with
us, you need to know stuff.

37:26.677 --> 37:27.778
Yeah. Okay.

37:27.911 --> 37:29.945
- First lesson.
- Yeah. Hit me.

37:30.079 --> 37:32.481
Always survey from high ground
when possible.

37:32.614 --> 37:33.750
- Always.
- Always.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.318
Helps you spot the big ones
in advance.

37:35.451 --> 37:37.320
It's nice to know that thing's
not following us anymore.

37:37.452 --> 37:40.757
No, no, it's definitely still
following us. Just saw it.

37:40.889 --> 37:42.424
- What...
- Yeah.

37:42.559 --> 37:44.995
- Chumbler.
- I knew it.

37:45.128 --> 37:48.097
- Big son of a bitch too.
- Big sumanabitch.

37:48.231 --> 37:50.133
Got your scent too, man.

37:50.266 --> 37:53.536
- It's gonna be hard to shake.
- Then why are we still standing here?

37:53.670 --> 37:56.005
Relax.
Chumblers aren't fast.

37:56.139 --> 37:57.907
- We gotta keep moving.
- Mmm.

37:58.041 --> 38:00.010
Should've already been gone.

38:01.311 --> 38:04.414
- It's got my scent.
- Oh, yeah, it does.

38:13.889 --> 38:15.792
- Comin'?
- Yeah!

38:17.559 --> 38:19.663
- Where you guys headed anyway?
- North.

38:19.795 --> 38:21.964
- To the mountains.
- What's up there?

38:22.099 --> 38:24.534
A, uh, place called
Snow Mountain Wilderness.

38:24.668 --> 38:27.938
Supposed to be some kind of
colony up there full of survivors.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.839
The cold and elevation
help to keep the monsters away.

38:30.974 --> 38:33.109
You should definitely
come with us.

38:33.242 --> 38:34.878
Well, I would, but, you know...

38:35.010 --> 38:36.945
You gotta go
find your girlfriend.

38:37.079 --> 38:38.582
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh...

38:41.650 --> 38:43.085
Minnow.

38:44.052 --> 38:45.721
If you knew her,
you'd really like her.

38:45.855 --> 38:46.990
She's a super cool person.

38:47.123 --> 38:48.557
Well, she's not gonna like you,

38:48.690 --> 38:51.527
'cause you can't even get out
of a Sandgobbler's nest.

38:51.661 --> 38:54.930
And honestly, I just like you
'cause you have a really cute dog.

38:55.065 --> 38:58.568
- Hurts my feelings.
- You're so useless.

39:00.302 --> 39:02.873
It just means
she likes you, man.

39:03.005 --> 39:05.474
She's, uh...
She's been through a lot.

39:07.476 --> 39:08.443
Yeah.

39:08.577 --> 39:10.614
So annoying.

39:11.748 --> 39:13.884
- Joel.
- What?

39:14.518 --> 39:16.085
Don't move.

39:16.219 --> 39:18.355
- Oh, my God. Why?
- Give me your shirt.

39:18.487 --> 39:20.422
My shirt? What do you mean?

39:20.556 --> 39:23.259
Your shirt, man.
Give me your shirt.

39:23.393 --> 39:25.795
- Okay.
- Get... Hurr... Come on.

39:25.929 --> 39:28.731
- Do what he says, Joel.
- Give me your shirt.

39:28.865 --> 39:30.599
Shut up. I'm trying.

39:30.733 --> 39:32.402
Easy. Take it easy.

39:33.336 --> 39:35.271
- That's it. That's it.
- Is it a Chumbler?

39:35.405 --> 39:37.473
- No.
- What is it called?

39:38.074 --> 39:40.677
Take it easy. Lean over, man.

39:40.811 --> 39:42.245
- If I don't make it...
- Shh, shh.

39:42.378 --> 39:45.048
That's it. That's it.

39:47.182 --> 39:48.617
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:48.751 --> 39:51.421
Just stay very still.

39:51.554 --> 39:54.958
- Okay.
- Shh.

39:55.791 --> 39:57.259
Okay, buddy.

39:59.929 --> 40:03.099
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Easy does it.

40:03.233 --> 40:06.135
It's okay.

40:07.371 --> 40:08.805
You're okay.

40:08.938 --> 40:12.309
It's okay.
You're all right.

40:13.108 --> 40:15.478
All right. Okay, now.

40:16.211 --> 40:19.349
On your way.

40:19.782 --> 40:21.050
Okay, now.

40:23.186 --> 40:25.888
All good. On your way now.

40:26.021 --> 40:27.356
On your way.

40:29.291 --> 40:31.627
Good boy. Good boy.

40:39.202 --> 40:41.805
What you so scared for?
Boulder Snails are nice.

40:42.338 --> 40:43.840
There can be nice ones?

40:43.974 --> 40:47.276
You can always tell in their eyes.
Just look at their eyes.

40:47.409 --> 40:50.346
- This one probably saved our lives too.
- Saved our...

40:50.480 --> 40:53.516
Gonna spread your scent
all over this hillside.

40:53.650 --> 40:57.387
Shoot. That old Chumbler ain't
gonna know which way to go.

40:57.521 --> 40:59.722
So the Chumbler's
gonna follow my shirt?

40:59.856 --> 41:02.291
Thank you, Mr. Boulder Snail.

41:02.425 --> 41:05.429
- Thank you, Mr. Boulder Snail!
- Thank you.

41:05.561 --> 41:08.063
Yeah, they're
very sensitive, you know.

41:09.264 --> 41:11.734
But they'll crush your ass...

41:12.735 --> 41:14.471
in a second.

41:20.643 --> 41:22.278
What you working on, man?

41:22.411 --> 41:26.681
Just a little project I started
a while back in my colony.

41:26.815 --> 41:31.453
Every time we encountered a new
monster, I'd just make a little entry.

41:31.586 --> 41:32.822
Mm-hmm.

41:32.956 --> 41:35.726
A drawing.
Um, just some info about it.

41:35.858 --> 41:38.293
You know, strengths, weaknesses.
Stuff like that.

41:38.427 --> 41:40.896
Made me feel like
I was helping out, you know.

41:41.030 --> 41:44.065
- You're a pretty good artist.
- Thanks.

41:44.199 --> 41:46.935
- I seen this one. Ugly bastard.
- Yeah.

41:47.070 --> 41:48.638
- Doesn't like loud noises.
- Oh, yeah.

41:48.771 --> 41:51.875
Also doesn't like
shotgun blasts to the head.

41:52.007 --> 41:53.708
Might wanna add that.

41:54.242 --> 41:56.278
Shotgun to the face.

41:56.411 --> 41:57.779
- Yeah. Got it.
- Oh.

41:57.914 --> 41:59.849
- Do you mind if I...
- Oh, sure.

41:59.981 --> 42:02.150
Yeah. Oh, thanks. Thanks.

42:02.652 --> 42:04.887
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

42:05.021 --> 42:06.923
I was 16 when it hit.

42:07.056 --> 42:09.525
Yeah, they sent everything
up at once to take her down.

42:09.659 --> 42:12.195
They had the balls
to call us the lucky ones

42:12.327 --> 42:15.664
just 'cause whatever the hell was
in those things didn't affect us.

42:15.798 --> 42:20.070
Ain't nothing lucky about getting
kicked off the top of the food chain.

42:20.202 --> 42:24.541
Yeah, my parents thought if we
could just make it out of Fairfield,

42:24.673 --> 42:26.007
we might have a shot.

42:26.141 --> 42:27.710
Wait, wait, wait.

42:29.110 --> 42:30.980
You're from Fairfield?

42:31.112 --> 42:33.215
Yeah. Why?

42:34.650 --> 42:38.019
Man, I've never met anyone
who made it out of Fairfield.

42:38.153 --> 42:41.090
That place
was basically ground zero.

42:41.224 --> 42:44.661
Shit, I've only heard
horror stories.

42:46.228 --> 42:47.864
Yeah,
it was pretty bad.

42:47.996 --> 42:49.699
Your parents, uh...

42:50.166 --> 42:51.601
Oh, uh, no.

42:51.733 --> 42:54.804
No, it's just me.

42:57.641 --> 42:59.342
Couldn't save 'em.

43:00.043 --> 43:02.112
You putting that on yourself?

43:02.577 --> 43:04.413
Mmm.

43:05.447 --> 43:07.250
You're from Fairfield, man.

43:07.382 --> 43:09.585
You shouldn't even be here.
Right?

43:09.719 --> 43:12.722
You're more of a survivor
than I thought.

43:15.690 --> 43:18.594
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

43:19.295 --> 43:21.097
It's a good start.

43:21.230 --> 43:25.635
Keep it up. Book like this could
save someone's life out here.

43:27.036 --> 43:28.070
Thanks, Clyde.

43:29.905 --> 43:31.240
You, um...

43:32.275 --> 43:34.144
sure your girl's worth it?

43:34.811 --> 43:36.413
Coming all this way?

43:39.048 --> 43:40.416
Yeah.

43:40.916 --> 43:42.152
Yeah, she is.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.788
Don't settle, Joel.

43:46.690 --> 43:48.291
She's right.

43:48.425 --> 43:50.327
You don't have to.

43:51.293 --> 43:53.697
Not even at
the end of the world.

44:06.009 --> 44:08.777
Okay! Time to break camp! Let's go!

44:08.911 --> 44:10.713
Uh, wh...

44:10.847 --> 44:12.214
Lesson two.

44:12.347 --> 44:15.284
You get a hot meal
or a good night's sleep.

44:15.418 --> 44:17.787
- Not both.
- Not both.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.755
Are you being serious?

44:19.889 --> 44:22.057
Something will have smelled our food and
be all over this camp within the hour.

44:22.190 --> 44:26.194
Why wouldn't you tell me that, though?
Uh, I didn't... I didn't do either.

44:26.329 --> 44:29.231
I can't tell you everything,
man. Keep up.

44:39.809 --> 44:44.113
"Roar! I'm gonna kill you, Joel Dawson!
I'm gonna eat you like broccoli!"

44:46.382 --> 44:48.083
"I'm Joel,
and I can't protect my girlfriend

44:48.217 --> 44:51.519
because I'm useless and insecure
and an awkward little teenager."

44:51.653 --> 44:53.789
"But I need you to save me!
I thought you loved me."

44:53.922 --> 44:57.459
"But I can't because..."

44:57.592 --> 44:59.628
- What?
- That's your girlfriend dying.

44:59.762 --> 45:01.998
- What?
- A needle through water.

45:02.865 --> 45:05.768
A needle through water.
Needle through water.

45:07.536 --> 45:11.207
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yes! See? Bull's-eye!

45:11.740 --> 45:13.476
Oh.

45:13.608 --> 45:15.376
Got yourself
an admirer there, huh?

45:15.510 --> 45:17.614
Hey, we gotta get going.

45:17.746 --> 45:19.280
Uh, okay.

45:19.414 --> 45:21.650
Come on. Come on.
We gotta go. We...

45:22.619 --> 45:24.988
Minnow? What are you doing?

45:25.822 --> 45:28.691
<i>Dear Aimee,
I made friends.</i>

45:28.824 --> 45:29.992
<i>Human friends.</i>

45:30.126 --> 45:31.861
<i>And they're teaching me
everything they know.</i>

45:33.396 --> 45:36.432
<i>Like lesson three:
Don't take shortcuts.</i>

45:38.900 --> 45:42.038
<i>Lesson eight:
Target practice every day.</i>

45:42.170 --> 45:43.739
<i>I'm getting pretty good
with my crossbow.</i>

45:43.873 --> 45:45.740
- See?
- Pretty good.

45:45.875 --> 45:49.746
<i>Lesson ten: Keep your socks dry.
That's a great one.</i>

45:50.847 --> 45:53.550
<i>I'm kinda struggling
with lesson two: Not both.</i>

45:53.682 --> 45:55.385
<i>That one is not great.</i>

45:56.219 --> 45:58.320
Not both. Not both.

45:58.454 --> 46:00.923
Come on, Joel. Not both.

46:01.056 --> 46:02.891
<i>I'm super tired.</i>

46:11.233 --> 46:14.671
All right, a lot of things out
here you shouldn't touch or eat,

46:14.804 --> 46:18.340
but, uh, ferns like these
have an antivenom.

46:18.474 --> 46:21.678
Good in a pinch
for snakes, slugs.

46:21.811 --> 46:24.247
- Great entry for your book.
- Yep, got it.

46:25.181 --> 46:28.284
The insect-looking ones
got no peripheral vision.

46:28.416 --> 46:29.652
No peripheral... Ah!

46:29.786 --> 46:32.288
The lizard-looking ones
can't climb for shit.

46:32.420 --> 46:35.958
The amphibian-looking ones like to
hide, lure ya in, eat ya whole.

46:36.092 --> 46:38.360
Then there are the Sandgobblers.

46:38.494 --> 46:40.129
Those guys are badasses.

46:40.262 --> 46:42.164
Badasses!

46:42.297 --> 46:44.132
Yeah, I know.
I fell into their hole.

46:44.266 --> 46:45.902
What you saw were worker bees.

46:46.034 --> 46:49.605
What you wanna avoid under
all circumstances is a queen.

46:49.739 --> 46:51.407
How do I know if it's a queen?

46:51.539 --> 46:55.478
Well, your first clue would be a
giant fin slicing through the earth,

46:55.612 --> 46:58.782
following every single sound
and vibration you make.

46:58.914 --> 47:00.817
You howling in pain...

47:00.949 --> 47:03.952
...as you're being ripped
in half will be your second.

47:04.086 --> 47:06.855
Copy. I'll keep that in mind.

47:06.989 --> 47:10.492
Well, we're getting
close to where our paths diverge.

47:10.626 --> 47:14.097
You're gonna wanna go west
to Jenner, the beaches.

47:14.230 --> 47:17.867
Or you can be sensible,
come with us to the mountains.

47:18.833 --> 47:22.270
Yeah, um, I think I've been
sensible all my life,

47:22.403 --> 47:24.007
and it's really
gotten me nowhere.

47:24.139 --> 47:26.708
Come with us.
Strength in numbers, you know?

47:27.577 --> 47:29.579
Besides,
think we'd make a good team.

47:29.711 --> 47:31.914
No, I think so, too.
I just, uh...

47:32.648 --> 47:34.050
It's just something I gotta do.

47:34.182 --> 47:36.152
It's not fair.

47:36.284 --> 47:38.887
Wh... Hey. Wha...

47:39.021 --> 47:42.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa. What's going on?

47:42.425 --> 47:44.394
Why do you gotta go?

47:46.161 --> 47:49.331
'Cause this girl, she means a lot to me.
You know?

47:49.465 --> 47:53.436
Come on. You know I gotta do this.
We talked about this.

47:54.637 --> 47:57.139
Hey, you know what?
I got something for ya.

47:57.273 --> 47:59.675
I don't even know if you'd know
what this is, but...

47:59.809 --> 48:01.110
Lipstick?

48:01.242 --> 48:02.277
Oh.

48:02.411 --> 48:04.212
- What?
- Yeah.

48:04.347 --> 48:06.615
Yeah, it's lip...

48:06.748 --> 48:08.050
Aw.

48:09.784 --> 48:12.153
I take back
what I said before.

48:12.288 --> 48:13.923
Aimee's gonna love you.

48:15.490 --> 48:17.592
Thanks, Minnow.
You got some snot.

48:17.726 --> 48:20.129
Yeah.

48:20.996 --> 48:23.565
All right. Come on.

48:29.438 --> 48:31.007
Final lesson.

48:32.775 --> 48:34.343
Listen to your instincts
out here.

48:34.476 --> 48:35.944
They'll keep you alive.

48:36.079 --> 48:39.749
Yeah. What if I have,
uh, terrible instincts?

48:39.882 --> 48:40.916
You'll die.

48:41.449 --> 48:42.884
Y...

48:43.018 --> 48:47.121
Listen, man, good instincts
are earned by making mistakes.

48:48.090 --> 48:50.292
If you're lucky enough
to survive a few mistakes,

48:50.425 --> 48:52.661
you're gonna be
okay out here.

48:54.597 --> 48:56.332
This might come in handy, too.

48:56.465 --> 48:57.833
Wow!

48:58.701 --> 48:59.969
Oh, that's great.
Do you have, uh...

49:00.101 --> 49:01.836
Do you have any more
that I could have?

49:01.971 --> 49:03.005
You get one.

49:03.139 --> 49:07.242
Pull the pin, count to five.
Not four, not six.

49:07.376 --> 49:08.976
Five.

49:09.110 --> 49:10.480
Got it.

49:13.849 --> 49:15.151
You're gonna be okay.

49:16.985 --> 49:17.953
Minnow?

49:18.086 --> 49:19.521
Let's go, kid.

49:22.690 --> 49:25.928
Hey, man, you made it
all this way from Fairfield.

49:26.829 --> 49:29.199
What's another 30 miles, huh?

49:39.375 --> 49:41.242
Uh-oh, here he comes.

49:41.376 --> 49:43.112
Hi.

49:45.414 --> 49:46.816
Hey there.

49:59.762 --> 50:01.864
I know.
I'm gonna miss 'em, too.

50:01.998 --> 50:04.465
It's a good decision,
though. It's good.

50:04.599 --> 50:06.835
You feel good about it,
right?

50:09.739 --> 50:11.173
Come on, Boy.

50:46.775 --> 50:49.144
Aw, I'm okay.
I'm just gonna...

50:50.146 --> 50:51.781
You can have that.

50:52.681 --> 50:54.549
I'll just stick
to the beans.

50:54.682 --> 50:55.818
I'm good.

50:55.952 --> 50:58.254
I'm not gonna eat that,
so...

51:15.204 --> 51:17.272
Hey, come on.
We gotta keep moving.

51:17.405 --> 51:20.943
I know. There's a lot
of creepy stuff. Creepy boats.

51:22.411 --> 51:23.979
Kind of a creepy sign.

51:24.112 --> 51:27.182
But nothing
we haven't seen before.

51:27.315 --> 51:28.583
Just gotta be brave.

51:28.717 --> 51:30.752
What...

51:32.054 --> 51:34.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on? What's happening?

51:34.822 --> 51:35.891
You okay?

51:36.025 --> 51:38.628
You hearing something, Boy?

51:38.760 --> 51:41.130
Boy, Boy, Boy! Boy!

51:43.199 --> 51:46.300
Hey! Boy! Boy! Boy!

51:46.434 --> 51:47.969
Boy! Are you okay?

51:48.103 --> 51:50.173
I need some kind
of communication here.

51:52.407 --> 51:55.143
Oh. I hear it.

52:06.255 --> 52:07.489
We gotta go. Hey.

52:07.623 --> 52:11.360
We really gotta go.
Please get out from under the duck.

52:20.603 --> 52:22.105
We gotta go.

53:19.929 --> 53:22.365
<i>Joel. You okay?</i>

53:23.599 --> 53:25.001
You okay?

53:25.833 --> 53:27.602
Joel! Get out of the car!

53:28.204 --> 53:29.638
<i>Joel, get outta the car!</i>

53:33.375 --> 53:35.077
Run, Joel, run!

53:35.210 --> 53:37.145
<i>Run! Go!</i>

53:41.684 --> 53:42.952
<i>You can survive this.</i>

53:43.085 --> 53:46.222
I love you. I love you.

54:08.210 --> 54:09.778
No.

54:13.514 --> 54:14.850
Hey!

54:33.702 --> 54:35.938
Boy?

54:38.474 --> 54:40.143
Are you okay?

54:43.344 --> 54:44.980
Yeah! Yeah, you're okay!
You're okay!

54:45.114 --> 54:48.550
You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

54:48.684 --> 54:50.319
Aren't you? Aren't you?

54:50.452 --> 54:52.154
Ah!

54:52.288 --> 54:53.489
Yeah!

54:54.856 --> 54:56.359
We're monster killers.

54:56.492 --> 54:59.528
Whoo-ooh!

55:05.434 --> 55:06.836
Ah!

55:12.340 --> 55:13.909
Wow.

55:14.043 --> 55:16.612
You know, I haven't felt
the rain in seven years.

55:16.746 --> 55:19.248
Pretty cool.
Pretty cool.

55:23.885 --> 55:26.121
Hey, Boy,
you think I'm crazy?

55:27.655 --> 55:29.424
Coming all this way?

55:32.126 --> 55:34.163
Hello.

55:51.880 --> 55:53.615
Holy shit.

55:55.951 --> 55:57.686
You're alive.

55:57.820 --> 56:00.489
I mean... you're on.

56:00.621 --> 56:05.894
I have 51 minutes of power left.
What is your name?

56:06.027 --> 56:08.596
Uh, I'm Joel.

56:09.331 --> 56:11.967
- My name is Joel.
- Hello, Joel.

56:12.101 --> 56:14.536
I am so pleased to meet you.

56:14.670 --> 56:16.238
My name is Mavis.

56:16.371 --> 56:18.373
But if you were to write it out,

56:18.507 --> 56:21.376
you would write it
with a 1 and not an I.

56:21.510 --> 56:23.178
Yeah, I know.

56:23.311 --> 56:27.181
You are familiar with the Mav1s line.
Delightful!

56:27.315 --> 56:29.717
You guys were supposed to be
the next amazing thing.

56:29.851 --> 56:31.554
I can't believe
I'm talkin' to one.

56:31.686 --> 56:33.422
But if you were to write it out,

56:33.556 --> 56:36.659
you would write it
with a 1 and not an I.

56:38.025 --> 56:40.194
Yeah. You said that.

56:40.829 --> 56:43.164
Years ago, I was bitten in half

56:43.297 --> 56:46.534
by something
I did not get a chance to name.

56:46.668 --> 56:49.471
I crawled here for safety
and powered down,

56:49.605 --> 56:52.840
hoping someone
would one day find me.

56:52.974 --> 56:55.309
And here you are!

56:55.443 --> 56:56.277
Amazing.

56:56.411 --> 56:58.847
Joel, besides
conversing with me,

56:58.980 --> 57:00.715
for which
I am eternally grateful,

57:00.849 --> 57:04.652
may I ask what you are doing
outside of your colony?

57:04.786 --> 57:05.721
Yeah, um...

57:05.853 --> 57:08.490
Did you steal food?

57:08.623 --> 57:09.857
No.

57:09.990 --> 57:11.525
No, I didn't steal
any food.

57:11.659 --> 57:15.998
Um, I'm actually on a quest...
to find a girl.

57:16.130 --> 57:20.067
Why, Joel, a lovely lady
has caught your eye!

57:20.202 --> 57:21.436
What is her name?

57:21.570 --> 57:25.374
Uh, her name's Aimee.
With one I and two E's.

57:25.507 --> 57:29.545
She sounds like
an incredible person, Joel.

57:30.947 --> 57:33.715
Is there anything
I can do to assist you

57:33.849 --> 57:37.486
in your quest for Aimee
with one I and two E's?

57:37.619 --> 57:42.358
Nope. Appreciate it, Mav1s,
but, uh, unfortunately not.

57:42.490 --> 57:46.329
Unless you happen to have a power
source to an SK-21 ham radio handy.

57:48.030 --> 57:49.398
Oh, no, but...

57:49.530 --> 57:52.800
I would be honored to donate
my remaining power to you

57:52.934 --> 57:57.373
if it would help you with your quest
for Aimee with one I and two E's.

58:02.445 --> 58:05.213
She probably thinks
I've been devoured by now.

58:05.347 --> 58:08.017
Oh, this is all so exciting!

58:10.318 --> 58:12.555
- It's working.
- Hooray!

58:13.688 --> 58:16.090
3022? Come in, 3022.

58:16.224 --> 58:18.427
- <i>Joel?</i>
- Aimee! Hey. Hey.

58:18.559 --> 58:20.996
<i>Your colony told me you were
coming here. Are you okay?</i>

58:21.130 --> 58:23.599
<i>I was worried.
It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

58:23.731 --> 58:27.168
Yeah, it's good to hear yours, too.
Yeah, I'm alive. I'm good. I'm okay.

58:27.302 --> 58:29.971
<i>I-I-I can't believe
you're actually doing this.</i>

58:30.105 --> 58:33.141
I know. It's crazy. Aimee,
I cannot wait to tell you everything.

58:33.275 --> 58:35.077
I feel like a whole new man,
you know?

58:35.210 --> 58:37.512
You should see me out here.
I'm fighting monsters.

58:37.646 --> 58:39.914
I'm in a motel right now
with a robot and a dog.

58:40.048 --> 58:42.250
<i>What? That sounds crazy.</i>

58:42.384 --> 58:44.519
<i>How far are you
from Jenner Beach?</i>

58:44.652 --> 58:48.189
Um, how far? I'm getting close.
I'm, um...

58:49.157 --> 58:50.525
I'm 9.3 miles to you.

58:50.659 --> 58:53.595
<i>Joel, listen.
I have amazing news.</i>

58:53.728 --> 58:56.931
<i>Some survivors showed up a few days
ago, and they're rescuing us.</i>

58:57.065 --> 58:58.399
<i>They're gonna get us
out of here!</i>

58:58.532 --> 59:00.935
<i>They're really helping me
with the colony.</i>

59:01.068 --> 59:03.706
Oh. Okay, g-getting you out
of there? What do you mean?

59:03.838 --> 59:07.342
<i>I can't remember the last time I actually
felt like everything was going to be...</i>

59:07.809 --> 59:09.577
Wh... Aimee?

59:09.710 --> 59:11.012
Aimee? Aimee?

59:11.146 --> 59:12.248
Shit.

59:12.380 --> 59:15.083
My battery
has automatically shut down

59:15.217 --> 59:19.755
in order to preserve
my final 15 minutes of power.

59:19.887 --> 59:22.958
- I am very sorry, Joel.
- No, it's okay, Mav1s.

59:23.090 --> 59:25.027
You don't have to...

59:27.563 --> 59:28.997
Joel?

59:29.130 --> 59:33.033
I haven't been outside
in a very long time.

59:33.168 --> 59:35.403
Yeah. I hadn't, either.

59:41.376 --> 59:44.813
- There you go.
- Is something troubling you, Joel?

59:44.947 --> 59:49.084
You can tell me anything,
as I am an empathetic listener.

59:49.217 --> 59:55.423
Also, my memory banks will be
permanently erased in 14 minutes.

59:57.259 --> 01:00:01.228
You know that feeling where you just
completely put yourself out there?

01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:02.964
You know?
And you're so sure of it.

01:00:03.097 --> 01:00:06.902
And... right when you're
about to cross the finish line,

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:11.972
you just think is this the dumbest...
thing I ever could've done?

01:00:12.106 --> 01:00:14.742
I don't think it's dumb,
Joel.

01:00:14.876 --> 01:00:17.078
I think it's romantic.

01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:19.581
Right, see?
Yeah, okay, you get it.

01:00:20.548 --> 01:00:22.384
Romantic, that's what...
Yeah.

01:00:22.516 --> 01:00:25.686
Do not give up
on your quest, Joel.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:30.125
When you see her, she will
appreciate the grand romantic gesture

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:31.893
implied by your journey

01:00:32.025 --> 01:00:35.964
and be moved by your kindness
and leadership qualities.

01:00:36.097 --> 01:00:37.333
Thanks, Mav1s.

01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:43.103
Another option is that Aimee will
not see those qualities in you

01:00:43.237 --> 01:00:45.440
and you will have traveled
a great distance

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:48.409
only to be met
with disappointment.

01:00:48.543 --> 01:00:52.647
Perhaps you will have learned
valuable lessons along the way?

01:00:53.148 --> 01:00:54.649
Okay.

01:00:54.782 --> 01:00:58.452
A third option is that you
don't survive the journey at all

01:00:58.586 --> 01:01:00.688
and get eaten
by mutated insects...

01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:02.656
- Okay, that's... I get it.
- ...amphibians...

01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:05.126
There are so many ways
you could perish.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.227
I get it.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.663
Thanks for the...

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:10.532
Thanks for that.

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:14.803
Would you like
to see a trick, Joel?

01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:16.337
Sure.

01:01:16.471 --> 01:01:19.574
What is your full name,
and where were you born?

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:22.278
Uh, Joel Dawson.
Fairfield, California.

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:26.681
Whoa.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.251
Whoa.

01:01:29.384 --> 01:01:32.320
What lovely parents
you had, Joel.

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.191
Oh, my God.

01:01:35.824 --> 01:01:36.858
Wow.

01:01:37.592 --> 01:01:39.627
I don't even have a picture.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.097
What would you say
to your mother now, Joel,

01:01:43.231 --> 01:01:45.334
if you had the chance?

01:01:51.572 --> 01:01:53.608
I guess I'd tell her I'm okay.

01:01:58.346 --> 01:02:00.583
<i>I made it to a colony.</i>

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:04.887
Met a lot of really,
really good people

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:07.590
who took really good care of me.

01:02:15.063 --> 01:02:17.332
They also lost a lot, so...

01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:22.437
And I miss you guys so much.

01:02:27.242 --> 01:02:28.644
I'm so sorry.

01:02:39.487 --> 01:02:42.624
Oh, look! Sky Jellies!

01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:46.528
They're harmless
and quite lovely.

01:02:47.728 --> 01:02:48.896
Wow.

01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:52.934
Oh! <i>Canis familiaris!</i>

01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:56.338
You found my foot.
Thank you.

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:59.742
- That's my dog.
- He's delightful.

01:03:01.576 --> 01:03:03.579
Yeah, he's a good boy.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:08.584
Joel, would you like to hear a song?

01:03:09.184 --> 01:03:10.686
Yeah, okay.

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.915
You know, nature's kinda nice

01:03:40.048 --> 01:03:42.083
when there's nothing trying
to kill you.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:50.826
Mav1s?

01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:57.765
Thanks.

01:04:03.538 --> 01:04:05.974
<i>Some survivors
showed up at the camp.</i>

01:04:07.275 --> 01:04:10.044
That's not something I gotta worry
about, you don't think, right?

01:04:10.177 --> 01:04:12.914
I mean, what are the odds
that they're, like, awesome

01:04:13.047 --> 01:04:17.251
and similar to my age and potentially
a threat to me romantically?

01:04:17.385 --> 01:04:19.286
Slim to none, probably.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.490
I think it's good, actually.
I think we're totally, uh... fine.

01:04:22.623 --> 01:04:25.760
Actually, why don't we pick up the
pace a little bit, just in case...

01:04:27.262 --> 01:04:28.564
Um...

01:04:29.463 --> 01:04:31.333
Okay, you know what?

01:04:31.465 --> 01:04:33.469
Why don't we go
another way. Yeah?

01:04:34.902 --> 01:04:36.070
Uh...

01:04:39.407 --> 01:04:40.342
Boy?

01:04:40.474 --> 01:04:41.710
Boy!

01:04:43.344 --> 01:04:45.213
Boy, where you going?

01:04:56.791 --> 01:04:58.494
Queen.

01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.123
Run, Boy! Run!

01:05:29.257 --> 01:05:30.793
Get...

01:05:32.427 --> 01:05:34.663
Go, go! Go!

01:05:40.802 --> 01:05:41.935
Sh...

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.976
Wait!

01:05:48.108 --> 01:05:49.344
Boy!

01:05:49.476 --> 01:05:51.913
Boy, I can't run that fast!

01:06:07.961 --> 01:06:10.565
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

01:06:32.153 --> 01:06:33.889
Shh-shh-shh. Shh.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:40.229
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:07:09.523 --> 01:07:12.827
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:07:13.327 --> 01:07:14.695
I'm sorry.

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.869
What are you doing?

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:23.438
Don't you dare.

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:26.208
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

01:07:28.675 --> 01:07:30.211
No. Wait, Boy!

01:07:30.344 --> 01:07:31.679
Boy!

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:34.849
Boy, don't even think about it.

01:07:34.983 --> 01:07:36.617
Don't. Don't you do it.

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:38.753
Don't. Don't. No!

01:07:51.266 --> 01:07:52.968
Count to five.

01:07:54.335 --> 01:07:55.704
One, two...

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.109
Two. Uh, three, four...

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.644
five!

01:08:23.096 --> 01:08:25.064
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:08:25.198 --> 01:08:26.701
Yes!

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:29.171
Yes! Oh, my God!

01:08:30.238 --> 01:08:31.971
Oh, that was awesome.

01:08:32.104 --> 01:08:34.506
I feel like Tom Cruise.

01:08:36.844 --> 01:08:40.212
Oh! Ow.
What the hell is...

01:08:40.346 --> 01:08:41.917
Ow!

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.725
Ow!

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.395
Oh, my God.

01:08:56.331 --> 01:08:57.399
Ow! Ow!

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:02.368
Get that dress
out of my face!

01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:06.372
Boy?

01:09:16.184 --> 01:09:17.484
Oh!

01:09:23.524 --> 01:09:25.027
Oh, f...

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:38.270
Okay.

01:09:38.404 --> 01:09:40.006
Oh, no.

01:09:58.259 --> 01:10:00.627
Okay, all right,
I think I'm good.

01:10:00.761 --> 01:10:02.464
I think I got 'em all.

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.333
What?

01:10:07.769 --> 01:10:10.639
God! No!

01:10:14.475 --> 01:10:16.411
You! You! You!

01:10:16.543 --> 01:10:19.547
This is all your fault!
What is wrong with you?

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.116
Why don't you listen to me,
huh? Huh?

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.418
You have any idea what you just did?
You just almost got us killed!

01:10:24.551 --> 01:10:27.221
We are supposed to care
about each other, okay?

01:10:27.354 --> 01:10:31.058
I would never do that to you, never!
You bailed on me! Oh, my God!

01:10:31.192 --> 01:10:34.228
That freakin' dress!
I can't take it anymore!

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.649
<i>Dear Aimee,
It's not looking good.</i>

01:10:55.783 --> 01:10:57.919
<i>And by "it," I don't remember
what I was talking about.</i>

01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:02.157
<i>I can't feel my feet.</i>

01:11:02.289 --> 01:11:03.358
<i>Or my face.</i>

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:06.594
<i>I think I'm dying.</i>

01:11:17.137 --> 01:11:21.876
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Joel Dawson!
I'm gonna eat you like broccoli!</i>

01:11:23.176 --> 01:11:25.579
<i>Ferns like these
have an antivenom.</i>

01:11:25.712 --> 01:11:29.183
<i>Good in a pinch for snakes, slugs.</i>

01:11:56.511 --> 01:11:59.414
<i>If you find the best dog ever,</i>

01:11:59.546 --> 01:12:01.015
<i>that's Boy.</i>

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:04.051
<i>Please, look after him.</i>

01:12:04.652 --> 01:12:06.154
<i>Tell him I'm sorry.</i>

01:12:06.287 --> 01:12:08.322
- Have you seen my dog?
- <i>Tell him I love him.</i>

01:12:08.456 --> 01:12:10.925
Have you seen him?
I yelled at him.

01:12:11.059 --> 01:12:13.394
<i>And don't take his dress out of his mouth.
He doesn't like that.</i>

01:12:13.528 --> 01:12:15.396
And now I might not
ever see him again.

01:12:15.529 --> 01:12:18.599
<i>And please don't shout at him.
I know you won't.</i>

01:12:21.269 --> 01:12:22.436
Joel.

01:12:23.704 --> 01:12:25.171
Oh, my God.

01:12:25.706 --> 01:12:28.009
- It's you.
- Aimee?

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.478
I can't believe you made it.

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:33.514
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you made it.

01:12:33.646 --> 01:12:35.382
You made it,
Joel.

01:12:36.016 --> 01:12:38.854
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:42.823
Oh, you're so beautiful.

01:12:58.005 --> 01:12:59.574
That was nice.

01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:14.956
Aimee?

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:17.925
Aimee.

01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:19.761
- Aimee.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:13:19.894 --> 01:13:21.395
T-T-Take it easy.
Take it easy.

01:13:21.529 --> 01:13:24.900
Still pretty messed up from all the poison.
How do you feel?

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.168
I feel... I'm good.

01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:29.469
Good. No, I'm f...
I-I'm okay.

01:13:30.537 --> 01:13:33.673
What was it like? I mean,
you have to tell me everything.

01:13:33.807 --> 01:13:36.877
Honestly, it wasn't that bad. I don't
know what everyone's complaining about.

01:13:37.011 --> 01:13:39.546
- Oh?
- No, it was terrible.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.581
I almost... died a lot.

01:13:42.984 --> 01:13:45.119
It's so good to see you.

01:13:45.987 --> 01:13:47.788
I'm lucky you found me
when you did.

01:13:47.921 --> 01:13:49.189
About that, um...

01:13:49.323 --> 01:13:51.425
And hey, we... kissed.

01:13:51.559 --> 01:13:54.596
- You were hallucinating pretty hard.
- How amazing was that, huh?

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:56.564
You kissed Old Pete.

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:59.401
- Hi, Pete.
- Oh. Yeah.

01:14:01.702 --> 01:14:03.271
That'd be hilarious.

01:14:05.907 --> 01:14:07.409
Oh, yeah,
I really did.

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.680
I don't know how
to move on from this.

01:14:12.814 --> 01:14:14.914
What was that you said
on the radio about, uh...

01:14:15.048 --> 01:14:18.552
Yeah. This yacht captain and his
crew show up out of the blue.

01:14:18.686 --> 01:14:21.288
- Did you say a yacht captain?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:21.421 --> 01:14:24.490
And he says he can find us a safe
place to live and a new home.

01:14:24.625 --> 01:14:26.293
I'm trying to pack
everything up right now.

01:14:26.426 --> 01:14:28.128
Why is he called
a yacht captain?

01:14:28.261 --> 01:14:30.130
'Cause he's the captain
of the yacht, you moron.

01:14:30.264 --> 01:14:32.634
Oh, my God.
Be nice, Bill.

01:14:32.766 --> 01:14:34.534
- What?
- I'm trying to listen.

01:14:34.668 --> 01:14:37.706
So anyway, I just wanted to say
something to you, though...

01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:38.773
- Whoo.
- Oh!

01:14:38.905 --> 01:14:40.274
Aimee! Aimee!

01:14:40.408 --> 01:14:42.510
We got another leak
in the main line.

01:14:42.643 --> 01:14:45.212
Bastard's spitting freshwater
all over the beach!

01:14:45.345 --> 01:14:48.114
Yeah, yeah, thank you, Janice.
I'll be right there.

01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:49.849
- Oh.
- Hi, Joel.

01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:51.919
Hey, Janice.
Good to meet you.

01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:53.421
- Please...
- Everyone's so old.

01:14:53.554 --> 01:14:56.091
- You came at a crazy time.
- Yeah.

01:14:56.224 --> 01:14:58.226
- Can we put a pin in this?
- Yeah.

01:14:58.359 --> 01:15:00.695
Put a pin in it. Sure.

01:15:18.078 --> 01:15:19.514
Hey, man.

01:15:36.363 --> 01:15:38.432
It's all falling apart, Aimee.

01:15:38.565 --> 01:15:41.935
I don't know what's happening here.
What can we do?

01:15:42.069 --> 01:15:45.139
Yeah, I know, Janice.
I'm sorry.

01:15:45.273 --> 01:15:47.908
Janice, will you just...
Will you give me the wrench?

01:15:48.775 --> 01:15:50.778
This is a shitshow.

01:15:50.911 --> 01:15:54.282
Who left the kelp out in the sun?
That was meant to be packed up already.

01:15:54.414 --> 01:15:56.617
- It's gonna bring in the flies.
- It's swellin' up.

01:15:56.751 --> 01:16:00.288
Yeah, I don't think feet
are meant to be that color.

01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:02.957
Hey.

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:04.324
Perfect timing.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:07.394
Guys! Joel,
this is Dana and Rocko.

01:16:07.528 --> 01:16:10.030
- What's up?
- These are the guys from the yacht.

01:16:10.163 --> 01:16:11.465
Cool. Oh.

01:16:11.597 --> 01:16:14.001
Is that a...
Is that an arm cannon?

01:16:14.134 --> 01:16:15.536
Homemade.

01:16:15.668 --> 01:16:18.271
So which one...
which one of you is the yacht captain?

01:16:18.404 --> 01:16:21.007
Guilty as charged.
Captain Brooks Wilkinson.

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:23.210
- Royal Australian Navy.
- Oh, dear God.

01:16:23.344 --> 01:16:26.146
Retired, of course.
My mates call me Cap.

01:16:26.279 --> 01:16:27.282
How you doing, man?

01:16:27.414 --> 01:16:28.582
I see you've met
these specimens,

01:16:28.716 --> 01:16:31.018
but this beautiful lady,
that's our yacht.

01:16:32.019 --> 01:16:34.889
A little showy for my taste,
but she gets the job done.

01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:36.823
- Huh.
- Cap, this is Joel.

01:16:36.957 --> 01:16:38.525
Joel. Right.

01:16:38.658 --> 01:16:41.094
Joel ended up traveling seven
days on the surface to get here.

01:16:41.228 --> 01:16:43.297
- Seven days?
- Seven... Yeah, seven days.

01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:45.899
- That is one hell of a journey, Joel.
- It was. Yeah.

01:16:46.033 --> 01:16:48.068
I don't get it.
Why'd you leave your colony, Joel?

01:16:48.202 --> 01:16:49.804
You get caught stealing food?

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:53.606
No, I didn't get caught stealing food.
Why is that such a thing?

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.475
He came for love.

01:16:55.609 --> 01:16:57.143
Good on ya, mate.
That's beautiful.

01:16:57.278 --> 01:17:00.048
There is no mission
more admirable than love.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.482
Every sailor
worth his salt knows that.

01:17:02.615 --> 01:17:04.551
Yo, Cap.
We cooking this shit or what?

01:17:04.685 --> 01:17:06.987
Feel like I got King Kong's nuts
on my shoulders, man.

01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:09.090
That's charming, Rock,
really.

01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:12.460
Joel, you look like a man who
knows his way around a barbecue.

01:17:12.592 --> 01:17:15.262
- I... don't...
- Come help us get a fire started.

01:17:15.395 --> 01:17:17.764
Um, actually, I'm gonna...

01:17:17.898 --> 01:17:21.034
- catch up with Aimee for a sec, if it's...
- Yeah.

01:17:21.167 --> 01:17:23.436
I apologize.
I... Old habits.

01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:27.007
You show up and...
here I am trying to give you orders.

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.475
I'll give you guys
some privacy, yeah?

01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:30.411
- Thank you.
- Yeah, <i>namaste.</i>

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:32.212
Uh, I was gonna just,
if you...

01:17:32.345 --> 01:17:33.647
- Hey, Joel.
- Yeah?

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.716
We're throwing a killer
going-away party tonight.

01:17:35.849 --> 01:17:37.083
Nothing fancy, but...

01:17:37.217 --> 01:17:39.653
we'll have a drink together
to welcome you to the colony.

01:17:39.787 --> 01:17:40.722
Okay.

01:17:40.854 --> 01:17:42.054
First beer's on me.

01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:43.591
Thanks.

01:17:43.724 --> 01:17:45.259
He's nice.

01:17:45.391 --> 01:17:46.693
Brews his own beer.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:49.130
- Oh.
- Hello, darling. How are you?

01:17:49.262 --> 01:17:51.265
Course he does.

01:17:54.135 --> 01:17:56.704
I'm sorry. There's just so much
going on right now.

01:17:56.837 --> 01:17:58.038
- Do you mind?
- Yeah.

01:17:58.171 --> 01:17:59.205
It's crazy.

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.408
Pretty nice here, you know.

01:18:01.542 --> 01:18:03.711
Why, uh...
why do you have to leave?

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:06.347
- It's beautiful. It's just not safe.
- Right.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.047
Everyone's afraid.

01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:11.618
Even your bunker got breached,
and you're all young and strong.

01:18:11.752 --> 01:18:12.952
Yeah.

01:18:13.087 --> 01:18:14.822
Hey, Aimee?

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:18.859
Sorry. I know you got, like,
a lot going on, but, uh...

01:18:19.894 --> 01:18:23.063
you know, I came...
I came all the way here to see you,

01:18:23.197 --> 01:18:26.734
and so I'm just...
checkin' in.

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:30.538
Just wondering how you're...
feeling about that.

01:18:30.671 --> 01:18:33.106
I think it's the most romantic
thing anyone's ever done.

01:18:33.239 --> 01:18:35.809
You do? Okay.
Okay, good, 'cause, um...

01:18:35.943 --> 01:18:38.445
But listen, Joel, um...

01:18:38.578 --> 01:18:41.614
talking to you on the radio
was such a nice escape

01:18:41.748 --> 01:18:43.818
from the stress
of running this colony.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.586
Yeah.

01:18:45.719 --> 01:18:46.886
And, um...

01:18:48.154 --> 01:18:51.557
I mean, you're probably the only
person left alive from my old life.

01:18:52.024 --> 01:18:53.795
From Fairfield.

01:18:57.029 --> 01:18:58.398
Oh. There's a...

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:01.970
There's a "but" coming,
isn't there?

01:19:03.503 --> 01:19:06.908
But I didn't think
you'd actually come here, Joel.

01:19:07.774 --> 01:19:09.143
Oh. Um...

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.346
And I am so happy
to see you.

01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:12.847
I'm just not...

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:16.384
I'm not the same person
that I used to be, you know?

01:19:16.516 --> 01:19:18.752
Seven years,
that's a long time.

01:19:18.886 --> 01:19:22.323
I've... I've lost people.
My mom, my friends, and...

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:25.025
Last year I lost someone...

01:19:26.493 --> 01:19:28.596
and he meant a lot to me.

01:19:29.963 --> 01:19:31.265
Um...

01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:33.268
Whew.

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:55.522
Oh, man, I feel
like such an idiot.

01:19:55.655 --> 01:19:57.757
- No. No, don't.
- I didn't even...

01:19:57.891 --> 01:20:00.827
I didn't even ask you
if I should come.

01:20:00.961 --> 01:20:04.164
I just got so excited,
and I... I left.

01:20:04.297 --> 01:20:06.400
I don't know what I thought.

01:20:07.634 --> 01:20:09.636
Well, I know
what I thought.

01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:13.507
I'd come and...
and sweep you off your feet,

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.775
and we'd be happy.

01:20:15.908 --> 01:20:17.210
Oh, Joel.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:22.250
But you...
didn't w-want... me.

01:20:22.382 --> 01:20:26.386
I am so sorry. I should have
said something on the radio or...

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.023
No. It's okay.
It's okay. Um...

01:20:29.155 --> 01:20:32.393
I know this isn't how
you pictured this going, but...

01:20:34.895 --> 01:20:36.630
you'll still
come with us, right?

01:20:36.764 --> 01:20:40.702
Come with you...
Uh, on the... yacht?

01:20:42.869 --> 01:20:45.105
This is our shot
at survival.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.010
Give Cap a chance.

01:20:52.613 --> 01:20:54.782
Tell us.

01:20:54.914 --> 01:20:57.118
Yeah, come on, Cap.
Tell us another story.

01:20:57.251 --> 01:21:00.021
- Yeah, come on.
- Four years post-Agatha.

01:21:00.154 --> 01:21:02.089
HMS Brisbane. First watch.

01:21:02.221 --> 01:21:04.425
I was the first person
to see it coming over the wall.

01:21:04.557 --> 01:21:07.094
Giant lizard, two stories high.

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:11.599
I sounded the alarm.
Too late.

01:21:11.731 --> 01:21:14.600
We lost 1,032 souls that night.

01:21:14.734 --> 01:21:16.903
Those of us that survived
took to the sea.

01:21:17.037 --> 01:21:21.242
I mean, make no mistake.
We have lost this war. Right?

01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:25.112
There is no place for mankind on land.
But out there?

01:21:25.244 --> 01:21:27.247
There we got a chance.

01:21:27.381 --> 01:21:29.483
I've got a...

01:21:29.617 --> 01:21:32.485
Sorry. Just got a... question.

01:21:32.618 --> 01:21:34.621
I survived seven days
on the surface,

01:21:34.755 --> 01:21:39.092
and... if I can do that,
literally anyone can.

01:21:39.225 --> 01:21:42.395
Seven days on the surface?
I'm impressed.

01:21:42.529 --> 01:21:45.698
So maybe we still have
a chance... to fight

01:21:45.832 --> 01:21:48.869
and... and, you know, win, uh...

01:21:49.002 --> 01:21:51.537
win our...
win our world back.

01:21:51.671 --> 01:21:56.009
I have a plan. And if you have a
better one, mate, I'm... I'm all ears.

01:21:56.143 --> 01:21:59.078
- And I will stand by your side.
- You wanna hear my...

01:21:59.212 --> 01:22:01.347
You wanna hear my plan?

01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:02.817
It's, uh...

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:05.185
just, uh...

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:13.327
I got nothing, uh...

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.927
Hey, that's on me.

01:22:15.061 --> 01:22:17.963
I-I didn't mean to put you
on the spot, mate. It's...

01:22:18.097 --> 01:22:21.768
Well... Aimee tells
me you make a mean minestrone.

01:22:22.536 --> 01:22:23.871
And you're great
on the radio.

01:22:24.003 --> 01:22:26.139
Lord knows
I need a comms expert.

01:22:26.273 --> 01:22:29.710
Someone to teach Rocko how to cook.

01:22:30.978 --> 01:22:34.815
Do you guys have a radio I could use?
I want to contact my colony.

01:22:35.716 --> 01:22:39.220
7045, this is 3022.
Come in.

01:22:41.555 --> 01:22:45.059
7045, this is 3022.
Is anyone there?

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:46.860
Tim? Ava?
Anyone. Over.

01:22:46.993 --> 01:22:49.662
Cap thought you might
need a snack.

01:22:49.796 --> 01:22:52.165
- Oh.
- You know, he brews his own beer.

01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:55.603
- Yep. Yeah, I heard.
- It's good, man.

01:22:55.735 --> 01:22:57.939
- Cool. Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.961
<i>Hello? Is someone there?</i>

01:23:54.094 --> 01:23:55.229
Hey. Yeah! Yeah!

01:23:55.362 --> 01:23:57.463
Yeah, Ray, is that you?
It's me. It's Joel.

01:23:57.596 --> 01:23:59.099
<i>Joel?</i> <i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:23:59.233 --> 01:24:01.768
<i>Hey, guys! It's Joel. He made it!</i>

01:24:01.902 --> 01:24:03.936
- <i>You're kidding!</i>
- Hey. Hey, guys!

01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:06.506
It's me. It's Joel.
I'm... I'm... I'm safe.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.742
I-I made it.
I'm at Aimee's colony.

01:24:08.876 --> 01:24:10.644
- <i>He made it!</i>
- <i>Oh, my God, you're alive?</i>

01:24:10.777 --> 01:24:12.045
It's so good
to hear your guys' voices.

01:24:12.179 --> 01:24:13.748
<i>So good
to hear you, too, buddy.</i>

01:24:13.881 --> 01:24:15.582
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- I feel like it's been so long.

01:24:15.716 --> 01:24:18.251
- I've got so much to tell you guys.
- <i>Tell us what you've seen.</i>

01:24:18.385 --> 01:24:22.155
- I saw a queen Sandgobbler.
- <i>What's a queen Sandgobbler?</i>

01:24:22.288 --> 01:24:24.391
It's... I don't know,
but I blew it up.

01:24:24.524 --> 01:24:26.027
I blew it up
with a hand grenade!

01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:27.527
<i>Where'd you get a grenade?</i>

01:24:27.661 --> 01:24:29.262
Yeah,
it was so awesome, and...

01:24:29.396 --> 01:24:33.033
What else? What else?
Uh, I met these two really cool survivors.

01:24:33.167 --> 01:24:36.737
And they taught me all these things.
They live on the surface and...

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:39.105
And, oh, oh, oh!
I met a Mav1s.

01:24:39.239 --> 01:24:42.742
- I talked to a real live Mav1s.
- <i>No way! What's she like?</i>

01:24:42.876 --> 01:24:47.047
Uh, she was...
very informative, emotionally, and...

01:24:48.515 --> 01:24:52.019
And I got a dog too, um...

01:24:52.152 --> 01:24:55.590
- <i>Wow, Joel. You got a dog?</i>
- <i>And how is it with Aimee?</i>

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:57.725
Uh, really...

01:24:58.324 --> 01:24:59.961
really good.

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:04.431
<i>Joel, you simply surviving
that journey, it's incredible.</i>

01:25:04.564 --> 01:25:06.299
<i>We're proud of you, Joel.</i>

01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:09.969
Man, I really miss you guys.

01:25:11.238 --> 01:25:15.176
How is, uh... How is everything back there?
Give me the update.

01:25:15.309 --> 01:25:18.145
<i>Not good.
We've had multiple breaches.</i>

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:20.447
Multiple breaches? What do you mean?
Is everyone okay?

01:25:20.579 --> 01:25:23.582
<i>Not really. I don't think
we can stay here much longer.</i>

01:25:26.286 --> 01:25:27.654
Uh, guys?

01:25:27.787 --> 01:25:29.289
<i>We're surviving for now.</i>

01:25:29.422 --> 01:25:32.826
"Surviving for now."
What? Sur... Ray? Hey, guys!

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:35.630
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit.

01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:39.166
Hello, guys, can you hear me?

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.900
Guys?

01:25:51.243 --> 01:25:52.947
I gotta go back.

01:25:53.912 --> 01:25:55.815
What am I doing here?

01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:11.699
Purple berries.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.309
<i>Giant lizard, two stories
high, coming over the wall.</i>

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:26.580
<i>The lizard-looking ones
can't climb for shit.</i>

01:26:26.712 --> 01:26:28.448
Lying son of a bitch.

01:26:29.882 --> 01:26:31.719
Son of a bitch!

01:26:43.697 --> 01:26:46.300
Y'all like this shit, huh?

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:47.735
Aimee.

01:26:47.868 --> 01:26:49.937
Hey, hey. Aimee, Aimee, Aimee.

01:26:50.069 --> 01:26:51.771
- Joel!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:26:51.904 --> 01:26:53.873
- I have to talk to you.
- Joel!

01:26:54.975 --> 01:26:56.309
Oh, you're so drunk.

01:26:56.443 --> 01:27:01.681
Hot, super ripped, super awesome
Joely-Joely Dawson!

01:27:01.815 --> 01:27:03.384
Aimee, please.

01:27:03.516 --> 01:27:06.153
This is super important.
I need to talk to you about something.

01:27:06.286 --> 01:27:09.122
You have to get everyone
out of here right now.

01:27:09.256 --> 01:27:12.126
Okay, I think something bad is
about to happen. I'm telling you.

01:27:12.259 --> 01:27:14.793
I can feel it. This is a bad...
This is a bad vibe.

01:27:17.896 --> 01:27:20.835
I think he's planning something.
I don't think he's here to save you.

01:27:20.967 --> 01:27:23.237
- Who?
- The yacht captain. He tried to poison me.

01:27:23.369 --> 01:27:26.806
Cap. Cap's right there.
He's dancing.

01:27:27.908 --> 01:27:31.144
Oh, my... I hate him.
I hate him so much.

01:27:31.278 --> 01:27:33.579
Listen, he gave me
these poison berries, okay?

01:27:33.713 --> 01:27:36.048
And I know that the berries are
poison because my dog told me.

01:27:36.182 --> 01:27:37.850
You have a talking dog?

01:27:37.984 --> 01:27:40.085
- No, no, no, Aimee.
- I love dogs!

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:44.759
What'd he say?
Where is the little fella?

01:27:45.759 --> 01:27:46.826
Man down!

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.429
Please.
Please try to listen to me.

01:27:48.561 --> 01:27:50.764
I need your help.
Something's gonna happen.

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:52.833
Your colony,
they're in danger.

01:27:52.966 --> 01:27:53.900
- Joel.
- What?

01:27:54.033 --> 01:27:55.502
Joel!

01:28:05.278 --> 01:28:07.280
Oh, shit.

01:28:07.413 --> 01:28:09.682
- Aimee? Aimee?
- Joel? Joel, are you okay?

01:28:09.815 --> 01:28:11.085
Good morning.

01:28:11.217 --> 01:28:13.118
Joel, I'm sorry about
the fist to your face.

01:28:13.252 --> 01:28:16.657
I couldn't have you talking shit about us
on the radio. I didn't wanna mess this up.

01:28:16.789 --> 01:28:19.292
Dana, take care of it.

01:28:20.894 --> 01:28:23.697
Dana, d-don't.
Not the radio tower!

01:28:25.631 --> 01:28:29.002
- What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?

01:28:29.136 --> 01:28:32.373
So, you probably figured out
we're not on a pleasure cruise.

01:28:32.506 --> 01:28:35.643
My crew and I want to thank you
for your generous donations.

01:28:35.775 --> 01:28:37.978
Food, water,
supplies, medicine.

01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:39.813
We greatly appreciate it.

01:28:39.945 --> 01:28:43.449
It will see us through to the next
helpless colony down the coast.

01:28:43.582 --> 01:28:44.917
He's a food stealer!

01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:46.786
- You're right.
- Yeah.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.157
But it's not that simple. The world
is basically devoid of fossil fuels.

01:28:50.289 --> 01:28:52.192
Not enough to run
a yacht on, anyway.

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:55.561
So my crew and I,
we had to improvise just to survive.

01:28:55.695 --> 01:28:59.131
And we found a real special fuel source.
Actually, Rocko did.

01:28:59.265 --> 01:29:01.400
- Didn't ya, big fella?
- Yeah, that was me.

01:29:01.534 --> 01:29:05.840
Ten tons of pure power,
chained to the front of that yacht.

01:29:06.506 --> 01:29:08.108
She's sleeping now.

01:29:09.609 --> 01:29:11.311
She will be hungry soon.

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:20.487
What?

01:29:20.619 --> 01:29:22.355
Well, what can I say?

01:29:24.123 --> 01:29:25.824
Shit gets crazy
in the apocalypse.

01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:27.827
Oh, my God.

01:29:49.448 --> 01:29:52.485
Oh, my God.

01:29:53.386 --> 01:29:54.421
Run!

01:30:03.529 --> 01:30:04.398
Rose!

01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:10.336
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

01:30:14.207 --> 01:30:17.043
Mkay. Just gotta find a way
to free my hands from the...

01:30:17.176 --> 01:30:19.511
Oh.

01:30:19.645 --> 01:30:22.648
I have to stop these bastards
from taking our stuff!

01:30:22.783 --> 01:30:24.351
Oh, my...

01:30:25.451 --> 01:30:27.287
You traveled 85 miles
across hell.

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.189
I think
I can stop three assholes.

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:30.624
- You get the crab!
- What?

01:30:32.759 --> 01:30:34.994
This is desperate.

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:43.203
Aimee?

01:31:16.136 --> 01:31:18.438
Holy shit.

01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:19.573
Holy shit.

01:32:26.506 --> 01:32:28.207
No, no, no, no, no!

01:32:36.682 --> 01:32:38.685
Boy? Boy!

01:32:40.287 --> 01:32:42.489
Boy! Hey!

01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:48.761
Dana? Shoot the dog.

01:33:05.811 --> 01:33:07.113
Aimee!

01:33:08.814 --> 01:33:10.451
No!

01:33:12.284 --> 01:33:14.954
Rocko? Time to go. Let's mo...

01:33:18.757 --> 01:33:20.326
Oh, no, you don't.

01:33:22.529 --> 01:33:24.331
Boy! I need you
to listen to me right now.

01:33:24.463 --> 01:33:27.501
You see over there?
Go get Aimee.

01:33:27.634 --> 01:33:28.967
Let's move it!

01:33:29.101 --> 01:33:30.737
Go now. Now. Now!

01:33:30.869 --> 01:33:32.538
I'm sorry I yelled at you!

01:33:38.845 --> 01:33:40.513
Move.

01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:49.088
Okay, crab, you want some of...

01:33:51.891 --> 01:33:53.359
Whoa!

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:02.769
Okay! Whoa! Whoa!

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:05.905
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen.
You don't wanna do this.

01:34:15.448 --> 01:34:17.584
Oh, no!

01:34:25.925 --> 01:34:27.461
- Joel!
- Aimee!

01:34:27.594 --> 01:34:30.697
Aimee! Aimee, throw me the cannon!
I know how to kill it!

01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:53.020
You can always tell in the eyes.

01:34:53.153 --> 01:34:56.456
- What are you doing? Shoot it!
- Shoot it! What are you waiting for?

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:59.726
- Kill it!
- Goddamn it, shoot it!

01:35:01.027 --> 01:35:02.261
Needle through water.

01:35:05.765 --> 01:35:07.066
Cap?

01:35:15.073 --> 01:35:18.244
You're free.

01:35:49.242 --> 01:35:51.244
Oh, my God.

01:35:58.618 --> 01:36:01.655
Oh, shit, we're gonna die.
We're dying.

01:36:08.927 --> 01:36:11.163
No!

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:33.619
That was amazing.

01:36:33.752 --> 01:36:34.953
What? Uh...

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.157
- Amazing? Me?
- Yeah.

01:36:37.289 --> 01:36:38.692
You thought I was...

01:36:46.265 --> 01:36:48.034
- Thank you, Joel.
- Yeah?

01:36:48.167 --> 01:36:52.005
Yeah, well, I would've done it
different, but... you did all right.

01:36:52.137 --> 01:36:53.974
Oh. Okay.

01:36:54.106 --> 01:36:56.609
Sorry. Yeah, just...

01:36:56.743 --> 01:36:58.477
That's looking better.
Take care of it.

01:36:58.610 --> 01:37:00.079
- Bye now.
- Bye, guys.

01:37:01.381 --> 01:37:03.850
- Can you move this? Yeah.
- Aimee.

01:37:07.587 --> 01:37:09.422
- Hey.
- Hey. Um...

01:37:09.555 --> 01:37:12.925
I gotta get back to my colony,
see if they're okay.

01:37:13.059 --> 01:37:14.961
Right, yeah. Yeah.

01:37:15.094 --> 01:37:18.265
Some friends of mine told me that
there's a place in the mountains,

01:37:18.398 --> 01:37:20.266
I guess,
that's safe from the monsters.

01:37:20.399 --> 01:37:22.868
So maybe
we'll all head there.

01:37:23.002 --> 01:37:24.171
Oh.

01:37:24.304 --> 01:37:28.240
Um, it was really cool to just...
to see you in action,

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:33.612
and... I don't know, how you take
care of all these people, and then...

01:37:33.746 --> 01:37:36.949
- Oh.
- I'm so glad you came.

01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:42.154
I gotta go.

01:37:42.287 --> 01:37:44.022
I'm worried about 'em.

01:37:44.157 --> 01:37:45.559
Yeah.

01:37:46.626 --> 01:37:49.463
But I had something
for you. Um...

01:37:50.063 --> 01:37:51.965
Oh, my God.

01:37:52.097 --> 01:37:53.265
Crocodile Carl?

01:37:53.399 --> 01:37:55.467
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:37:55.601 --> 01:37:58.704
Thought you should
have him back finally.

01:37:59.872 --> 01:38:00.906
Here, uh...

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.644
- No, I can't take that. You need it.
- No, no, no.

01:38:04.777 --> 01:38:07.547
I want you to take it.
It'd mean a lot to me.

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.649
Really, take it.

01:38:11.117 --> 01:38:14.354
I got it all up here, anyway.
So I can always make copies.

01:38:14.487 --> 01:38:17.056
Thanks for
inspiring me to...

01:38:18.356 --> 01:38:20.393
take this trip.

01:38:20.525 --> 01:38:22.496
It's the best decision
I ever made.

01:38:23.662 --> 01:38:27.065
All right,
uh, I'm gonna go.

01:38:27.199 --> 01:38:29.234
- Yeah.
- Boy, come on!

01:38:29.368 --> 01:38:31.337
Um...

01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:33.939
- Uh, be careful.
- Yeah, you, too.

01:38:35.608 --> 01:38:37.411
- Bye, Aimee.
- Bye.

01:39:00.432 --> 01:39:01.935
That was...

01:39:02.068 --> 01:39:04.003
- Great.
- Yeah.

01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:13.046
I'll come find you.

01:39:15.381 --> 01:39:16.849
You better.

01:39:21.354 --> 01:39:22.588
Okay.

01:39:31.997 --> 01:39:34.033
<i>My name is Joel Dawson.</i>

01:39:34.167 --> 01:39:38.672
<i>I'm 24 years old,
and I survived seven days on the surface.</i>

01:39:46.645 --> 01:39:48.215
<i>Twice, actually.</i>

01:40:00.059 --> 01:40:01.293
- Joel?
- Joel?

01:40:01.427 --> 01:40:03.662
You guys! Hey!

01:40:03.796 --> 01:40:06.065
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:40:19.244 --> 01:40:22.481
I'm alive because of the
generosity of a few strangers

01:40:22.614 --> 01:40:25.885
and the kindness
of a great dog.

01:40:27.653 --> 01:40:30.088
<i>My colony and I
are headed to the mountains.</i>

01:40:30.221 --> 01:40:32.992
<i>There's supposed to be
less monsters there.</i>

01:40:33.126 --> 01:40:37.496
<i>And don't get me wrong.
The surface is a dangerous place.</i>

01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:41.434
<i>But I don't think hiding
underground is the answer anymore.</i>

01:40:41.568 --> 01:40:46.773
<i>There is a great big, beautiful,
inspiring world out there.</i>

01:40:46.905 --> 01:40:50.609
<i>And I know you think it
might be impossible, but it's not.</i>

01:40:50.743 --> 01:40:52.911
<i>If I can survive out here,
anybody can.</i>

01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:55.280
<i>It's like a good friend
once told me.</i>

01:40:55.413 --> 01:40:58.184
<i>Good instincts are earned
by making mistakes.</i>

01:40:58.317 --> 01:41:00.786
<i>If you're lucky enough
to survive a few mistakes,</i>

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.587
<i>you're gonna
do all right out here.</i>

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.625
<i>In this recording, you'll find
everything I know about our new world.</i>

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.628
<i>Most of this
I had to learn the hard way.</i>

01:41:08.761 --> 01:41:11.063
<i>Hopefully, it'll make your way
a little easier.</i>

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:14.467
<i>So crank open that hatch.</i>

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.935
Okay, come on.

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:19.972
<i>Breathe some fresh air.
Go. Live your life.</i>

01:41:21.039 --> 01:41:24.176
<i>It won't be easy,
but it'll be worth it.</i>

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:29.983
<i>I traveled 85 miles to find what I had
been missing below ground for seven years</i>

01:41:30.115 --> 01:41:32.585
<i>was right above my head
this whole time.</i>

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:34.420
<i>And it's incredible.</i>

01:41:35.454 --> 01:41:38.457
<i>Oh, and one last thing.
Don't settle.</i>

01:41:38.591 --> 01:41:42.762
<i>You don't have to.
Not even at the end of the world.</i>

01:41:50.636 --> 01:41:52.338
<i>Signing off,</i>

01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:54.239
<i>Joel Dawson.</i>

01:42:22.801 --> 01:42:25.270
"Don't settle"?
That's my line.

01:42:25.404 --> 01:42:28.173
It's a long journey, kid.
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:42:28.306 --> 01:42:31.109
He definitely doesn't.
Snow Spiders will probably get him.

01:42:31.243 --> 01:42:32.744
That's not a good way to go.

01:42:32.877 --> 01:42:34.246
They will tear him apart.

01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:37.417
- Nah, he'll figure it out.
- Possibly.
