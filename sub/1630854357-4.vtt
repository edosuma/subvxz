14:10.558 --> 14:11.851

14:11.893 --> 14:14.312
She's always been
a good customer.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.899
- Well, that's
who's helping me and Bob.

14:17.941 --> 14:21.277
Jennifer thinks having
this whole mess

14:21.319 --> 14:25.073
out in public would just be
the worst thing for everyone.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.075

14:29.494 --> 14:31.538
You don't wanna
put her through a trial.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.958
- I am thinking of Jan.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.713
Your husband kidnapped her
and needs to pay.

You and Mary Ann

14:51.641 --> 14:53.184

14:53.226 --> 14:55.687
from letting Jan spend...

14:55.729 --> 14:58.064
so much time with him.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.400
You practically
threw Jan at him.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.777
- We did what?
- With his therapy,

15:02.819 --> 15:06.948
his tapes, you...
you allowed that.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.953
And you know
what I'm talking about.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.039
That's what he says.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.332
And it's not just Jan.

15:18.043 --> 15:21.296
- What is that supposed
to mean?

15:21.338 --> 15:24.466
- Bob and I are very open
with each other.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.636
And he told me...

15:32.515 --> 15:34.309
What you did.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.565
But Bob says
if you aren't willing

15:40.607 --> 15:42.484
to work with Jennifer...

15:44.986 --> 15:47.947
Then it will go out in public

15:47.989 --> 15:52.369
that you are a sinful man

15:52.410 --> 15:55.538
with unnatural desires.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.126

27:53.673 --> 27:55.133
- Have a seat.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.143
- Hey, Jan.

28:05.185 --> 28:08.063
Would you tell the court about
your relationship

28:08.104 --> 28:11.107
with Mr. Berchtold?

28:17.405 --> 28:18.907
You don't have
to look at him, Jan.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.408
You can look at me.

What's your relationship
with Mr. Berchtold?

28:25.121 --> 28:28.166

- Um...

- You knew Mr. Berchtold
was unwell, didn't you?

28:58.321 --> 29:00.573
- I knew
he had various therapies,

29:00.615 --> 29:02.659
but I'm not a doctor.

29:02.701 --> 29:06.204
- Can you tell us more about
the therapy you knew of?

29:06.246 --> 29:10.125
- His psychologist
recommended it.

29:10.166 --> 29:15.797
He played these tapes
from his clinic in California.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.757
- What tapes, Mrs. Broberg?

29:17.799 --> 29:23.430
- Oh, they were just about him
being on vacation with his wife

29:23.471 --> 29:25.807
on a beach.

29:28.059 --> 29:31.312
He was supposed to...

29:33.481 --> 29:38.987
Lie beside Jan
and listen to them

29:39.029 --> 29:41.364
when she was asleep.

29:41.406 --> 29:46.786
<i>* *</i>

29:46.828 --> 29:49.164
- And you allowed this?

29:49.205 --> 29:51.124
- His doctor prescribed it,

29:51.166 --> 29:52.834
and he was never alone
with her.

29:52.876 --> 29:55.545
I would walk in the room
to put things away,

29:55.587 --> 29:58.173
and I never observed anything
unnatural going on.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.592
He was on top of the sheets.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.886
- You never thought
there was anything weird

30:02.927 --> 30:04.054
about this process?

30:04.095 --> 30:05.472
- Sure, I did.

30:05.513 --> 30:07.390
I'd never heard of this type
of therapy,

30:07.432 --> 30:14.189
but...there's a lot of things
that I've never heard of.

30:15.690 --> 30:20.445
And I accept that we have
to listen to doctors.

30:20.487 --> 30:23.823
And Mr. Berchtold was like
a part of our family,

30:23.865 --> 30:27.160
and I wanted to help him.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.913
I-I thought he needed our help.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.416
- So what do you believe now?

30:33.458 --> 30:35.585
Because you don't really have
any idea what went on

30:35.627 --> 30:37.003
in Mexico, do you?

30:37.045 --> 30:40.173
Except
what your daughter's told you.

30:40.215 --> 30:45.178
- I suppose...that's...true.

30:45.220 --> 30:47.430
- And what did she tell you?

30:47.472 --> 30:49.808
- That she and B
just went on a vacation

30:49.849 --> 30:51.393
and nothing bad happened.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.603
- And the doctors
find no evidence

30:53.645 --> 30:55.563
of anything inappropriate,
isn't that right?

30:55.605 --> 30:57.065
- Objection.
- And the allergy pills

30:57.107 --> 30:59.275
they tested were just
regular allergy pills.

30:59.317 --> 31:01.027
- Objection!
- So isn't it possible

31:01.069 --> 31:02.445
that it's just like
your daughter

31:02.487 --> 31:04.197
and all the doctors
and experts say

31:04.239 --> 31:06.157
and Mr. Berchtold
didn't do anything wrong?

31:06.199 --> 31:07.575
- Your Honor, objection!

31:07.617 --> 31:09.035
- Ms. Ferguson.

31:09.077 --> 31:11.705
- Withdrawn.

31:11.746 --> 31:14.249
No more questions.

31:16.209 --> 31:19.337
- I told Mr. Berchtold that day

31:19.379 --> 31:22.507
that he was not allowed
to take Jan.

31:22.549 --> 31:25.301
I was adamant,
and he betrayed me completely.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.053
- And what exactly
was the nature

31:27.095 --> 31:29.431
of your relationship
with my client?

31:29.472 --> 31:32.892
Would you say
you both were close?

31:32.934 --> 31:35.645
- Our families spent
a fair amount of time together.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.397
- Just your families?

31:37.439 --> 31:40.191
Or did you also spend
a lot of time one-on-one?

31:43.111 --> 31:47.574
- Now and again,
we would get together.

31:47.615 --> 31:51.786
But I will never let
Bob Berchtold anywhere near me

31:51.828 --> 31:55.582
or my family ever again.

31:55.623 --> 31:58.209
- Prior to Mexico, my client
describes your relationship

31:58.251 --> 32:01.463
to him as very close.

32:01.504 --> 32:03.423
Intimate.

32:03.465 --> 32:07.260
He says he shared a lot
of private things with you.

32:07.302 --> 32:09.971
Did you feel comfortable
being open with him?

32:13.308 --> 32:15.602
- That's all in the past.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.897
- Well,
you've signed affidavits

32:18.938 --> 32:21.733
saying you gave him permission
to take Jan on a road trip,

32:21.775 --> 32:23.485
and now
you're telling us the opposite.

32:23.526 --> 32:27.655
So how can anyone
trust your word?

32:33.828 --> 32:36.373
the judge is granting us
a trial.

32:36.414 --> 32:39.542
However,
you cannot take the stand

like you just did.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.338
- How do you mean?

32:43.380 --> 32:45.090
- You were okay, Bob.
Not perfect,

32:45.131 --> 32:47.759
but at least
you came across like someone

32:47.801 --> 32:50.595
who actually dislikes the man
who kidnapped his daughter.

32:51.304 --> 32:53.473
No more surprises.

32:53.515 --> 32:55.934
We cannot let your history
with this guy

32:55.975 --> 32:57.727
jeopardize our case.

32:57.769 --> 32:58.895
- It really didn't help

32:58.937 --> 33:01.147
that Jan denied
being kidnapped.

33:01.189 --> 33:03.900
- She's had
a difficult experience.

33:03.942 --> 33:06.111
- Well,
now that she's back home,

33:06.152 --> 33:07.570
it's important to make sure

33:07.612 --> 33:08.988
that she keeps her head
on straight

33:09.030 --> 33:11.199
when it comes to Berchtold.

within yourself to come to us

39:32.580 --> 39:35.542

to this transgression.

Obviously, this is a matter

After discussion and prayer,

39:43.675 --> 39:47.345
we've concluded
that a formal probation

39:47.387 --> 39:49.764

39:50.223 --> 39:55.395
But we do feel,
as representatives of the Lord,

39:55.437 --> 39:58.231
that because
this was a first offense,

39:58.273 --> 40:01.943
and since sexual encounters
with Brother Berchtold

40:01.985 --> 40:05.572
were not numerous,

40:05.613 --> 40:09.534
and because you show
genuine remorse,

40:09.576 --> 40:13.788
that excommunication
is not merited.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.878
We think
that your actions do merit

you being disfellowshipped.

Now this, above all,

41:34.744 --> 41:37.497
- It means that I can't
partake in the sacrament

41:37.539 --> 41:40.166
because I've made
some mistakes,

41:40.208 --> 41:42.377
but I will again soon.

41:42.419 --> 41:46.131
As long as I keep going
to church and be good,

41:46.172 --> 41:49.134

42:07.235 --> 42:09.946
I touched my earthly father

42:18.955 --> 42:22.876
I don't want anyone else

before we begin,

42:35.889 --> 42:39.351
I'd like to ask us all to pray
for Jasper Berchtold

42:39.392 --> 42:42.228
and the Berchtold family.

42:42.270 --> 42:45.273
Jasper has been taken
with a very sudden

42:45.315 --> 42:47.776
and confounding illness

42:47.817 --> 42:51.196
that the doctors
are still trying to diagnose.

42:51.237 --> 42:53.073
[congregation whispering]

So please,
do keep them in your thoughts.

42:58.453 --> 43:01.331
[whispering continues]

43:07.837 --> 43:09.547
- I made Jasper
a get well basket,

43:09.589 --> 43:11.091
and I wanna take it over.

43:11.132 --> 43:12.926
I just need
to tell him I'm sorry.

43:12.967 --> 43:14.594
- Wait,
you think it's your fault

43:14.636 --> 43:15.929
that he got sick?

43:15.970 --> 43:18.098
That doesn't make any sense.

43:18.139 --> 43:20.600
- You always say show charity
when people get sick.

43:20.642 --> 43:23.311
- You're not going over there.

43:32.654 --> 43:34.781
- What?
We were told not to interact

43:34.823 --> 43:36.616
with the Berchtolds, Mary Ann.

43:36.658 --> 43:39.077
- B won't even be there.

43:39.119 --> 43:40.829
He has to go back to Ogden
for work.

43:40.870 --> 43:42.789
He's probably halfway back
by now.

43:42.831 --> 43:44.708
- We're supposed
to cut off all contact

43:44.749 --> 43:46.459
with the whole family.

43:46.501 --> 43:49.421
- Jasper and the other children
haven't done anything wrong,

43:49.462 --> 43:52.257
and we have to decide
what's right for us, Bob.

43:52.298 --> 43:55.677
- Well, than this one's
an easy decision to make.

43:55.719 --> 43:57.887
- Children
shouldn't be punished

43:57.929 --> 44:01.349
for their parents' mistakes.

44:14.863 --> 44:17.782
- Well, come in.

44:21.369 --> 44:23.580
I wasn't expecting you.

44:23.621 --> 44:26.541
- Jan made this for Jasper.

44:26.583 --> 44:28.918
- Oh, my goodness.

44:31.212 --> 44:33.715
She truly does have
the biggest heart.

44:33.757 --> 44:35.800
Jasper will be so touched.

44:35.842 --> 44:37.802
I'll bring it to him.
I go back to the hospital

44:37.844 --> 44:39.721
tomorrow morning.

44:39.763 --> 44:42.223

44:49.189 --> 44:51.649

it might be something

44:51.691 --> 44:54.903
called "infectious neurosis."

44:54.944 --> 44:57.405
He just woke up and...

44:59.115 --> 45:00.867
Couldn't move his legs.

45:00.909 --> 45:03.703
We had to lift him down
from the top bunk.

45:03.745 --> 45:07.332
I mean,
thank heaven Bob was here.

45:07.374 --> 45:09.876
He had driven up
the night before for church.

45:09.918 --> 45:11.753
- Oh, my goodness.

45:11.795 --> 45:15.215
I'm so sorry for Jasper.

45:15.256 --> 45:19.844
- All I can think about
is what else I can do,

45:19.886 --> 45:22.722
how I can make him well.

45:22.764 --> 45:24.974
- When our children
are in pain,

45:25.016 --> 45:29.771
it's hard to think
of anything else.

45:32.857 --> 45:34.526

45:38.196 --> 45:42.409

your meat loaf recipe.

45:42.450 --> 45:44.244
It wasn't the same.

45:45.286 --> 45:48.123

Anytime.

45:53.878 --> 45:56.548
Mary Ann, I have to tell you...

45:58.967 --> 46:01.928
Bob just feels so bad.

46:01.970 --> 46:04.222
This whole thing
has wrecked him.

46:04.264 --> 46:07.267
- I can't talk about all that.
- He's desperate to apologize.

46:07.308 --> 46:11.771
I--I've never seen him
like this.

46:11.813 --> 46:16.609
But I know how badly he wants
to make things right with you.

You just have so much goodness

Help me understand

And why you got
those marriage papers with...

49:17.624 --> 49:20.502
- Well, dang it, Mary Ann.
You know why.

49:20.543 --> 49:24.506
It's because Bob
called the FBI.

49:24.547 --> 49:27.133
We had to get married on paper,

49:27.175 --> 49:28.760
'cause we both wanted
to come back.

49:28.802 --> 49:30.553
Otherwise I'd spend
the next ten years

49:30.595 --> 49:32.847

to get back to the States.

49:32.889 --> 49:34.808

49:34.849 --> 49:36.476
- Hell yes it's true!

49:36.518 --> 49:38.353
That's why I never even
told her about it.

49:38.395 --> 49:40.730
I didn't want her to think
we'd actually gotten married.

49:40.772 --> 49:43.566
That'd be a little weird.
