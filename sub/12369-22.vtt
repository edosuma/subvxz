WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.420
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.503 --> 00:05.046
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.130 --> 00:09.134
- VEGAS, BABY!

00:11.302 --> 00:13.430
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SPEND
THE WHOLE TIME GAMBLING.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.433
THIS TRIP IS A BACHELORETTE
PARTY FOR VICTORIA.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.101
- WHERE IS SHE ANYWAY?

00:18.184 --> 00:19.602
- OH, HER SHOES
WERE JUST DELIVERED,

00:19.686 --> 00:20.729
AND IT'S BAD LUCK FOR THE BRIDE

00:20.812 --> 00:23.231
NOT TO TRY HER WEDDING SHOES ON
AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.775
- AREN'T YOU GUYS A LITTLE
LONG IN THE TOOTH

00:25.859 --> 00:26.943
FOR SILLY SUPERSTITION?

00:27.026 --> 00:29.070
- LONG IN THE TOOTH?

00:29.154 --> 00:31.740
THIS FROM THE WOMAN WHO WALKED
INTO CAESAR'S PALACE AND SAID,

00:31.823 --> 00:35.618
"WASN'T REALLY LIKE THIS."

00:35.702 --> 00:38.663
- SAID THE LOOSEST SLOT
IN VEGAS.

00:38.747 --> 00:43.835
- EVERYONE,
I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.462
- OH, VICTORIA.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.590
- I'VE NEVER FELT
MORE BEAUTIFUL AND GRACEFUL.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.259
I FEEL LIKE I'M WALKING ON AIR.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.137
[yelps]

00:54.220 --> 00:55.638
- ARE YOU OKAY?

00:55.722 --> 00:56.639
- I'M FINE.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.101
OKAY.

01:00.185 --> 01:04.022
- VEGAS, BABY.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.621
{\an8}VICTORIA, I FEEL TERRIBLE.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.164
{\an8}- OH, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.665
{\an8}AND ON THE PLUS SIDE,

01:22.749 --> 01:25.543
{\an8}I SCORED THE HOSPITAL
CELEBRITY SUITE.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.088
{\an8}THE SHAH OF SOMEWHERE-ISTAN WAS
ADMITTED THE SAME TIME AS ME,

01:29.172 --> 01:32.801
{\an8}AND THEY PUT HIM IN A DOUBLE.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.302
{\an8}- DON'T YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT?

01:34.385 --> 01:36.012
{\an8}I MEAN, HE SEEMED REALLY SICK.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.806
{\an8}- OH, PLEASE, HE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.350
{\an8}HE WAS BABBLING INCOHERENTLY.

01:40.433 --> 01:45.063
{\an8}- HE WAS SPEAKING HIS LANGUAGE.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.856
{\an8}- VICTORIA, GREAT NEWS.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.233
{\an8}IT WAS JUST A MILD CONCUSSION.
- OH.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.276
{\an8}- WE'RE KEEPING YOU OVERNIGHT
FOR OBSERVATION,

01:50.360 --> 01:51.528
{\an8}BUT WE'RE LISTING YOU AS STABLE.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.572
{\an8}- THAT'S A FIRST.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.699
{\an8}- SALLY, ONCE AGAIN,

01:56.783 --> 01:58.326
{\an8}CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NURSING DEGREE.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.036
{\an8}- YEAH, YOUR FAMILY
MUST BE VERY PROUD.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.330
{\an8}- YES. VERY.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.331
{\an8}SALLY WAS IT?

02:03.414 --> 02:04.999
{\an8}- I'M YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.376
{\an8}YOU GAVE ME A MAKEOVER.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.544
{\an8}I WORK IN YOUR VET'S OFFICE.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.338
{\an8}YOU TOLD MY
FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

02:10.420 --> 02:12.715
{\an8}TO GET HER UPPER LIP WAXED.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.218
{\an8}- OH, YES.
YES.

02:15.301 --> 02:20.932
{\an8}THE LITTLE GIRL I SAVED
FROM TERRIBLE TEASING.

02:21.015 --> 02:26.229
OH, LIKE TOM SELLECK
IN A SUN DRESS.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.690
- I HEAR CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER

02:28.773 --> 02:29.983
FOR YOU AND EMMET LAWSON, TOO.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.067
- OH, THANK YOU.

02:31.150 --> 02:31.943
YES, SIR EMMET AND I

02:32.026 --> 02:34.112
HAVE BEEN ON
A LOT OF MAGAZINE COVERS.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.364
- OH, AND THE PUNCH LINE
ON ALL THE LATE NIGHT SHOWS.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.658
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE A PRETTY THICK
SKIN TO BE IN YOUR BUSINESS.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.743
- WELL, IF YOU CAN'T
TAKE A JOKE...

02:40.827 --> 02:44.581
WHAT ARE YOU
REFERRING TO EXACTLY?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.249
- WELL, LENO HAD
THIS GREAT JOKE LAST NIGHT

02:46.332 --> 02:48.877
ABOUT HOW YOU AND EMMET
HAVE 12 MARRIAGES BETWEEN YOU.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.420
PLUS HE'S IN PRISON.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.298
LENO WAS LIKE,
"EVEN LINDSAY LOHAN SAID,

02:53.381 --> 02:55.091
'ARE THEY SURE THEY
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING?'"

02:55.174 --> 02:57.218
[chuckles]

02:57.302 --> 03:01.598
- WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE LENO
IN VEGAS TONIGHT.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.267
- AND GAMBLE AND GET
ROOM SERVICE AND MASSAGES.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.268
- YEAH.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.936
NOT TO MENTION THAT VEGAS

03:07.020 --> 03:11.107
IS A GREAT PLACE
TO MEET GUYS OUR AGE.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.109
- LOT OF GUYS YOUR AGE
IN THIS PLACE TOO.

03:13.192 --> 03:16.946
HIP REPLACEMENT UNIT,
THIRD FLOOR.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.324
JUST SAYING.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.952
- SHOULD WE CHECK IT OUT?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.787
- WHY NOT?

03:24.871 --> 03:28.917
THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.712
- [sighs]
- OH, HONEY, YOU OKAY?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.631
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.341
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY

03:36.424 --> 03:38.259
IS DOING THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER

03:38.343 --> 03:40.094
AND EXPECTING
A DIFFERENT RESULT.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.138
WELL, I HAVE
HAD FIVE FAILED MARRIAGES--

03:42.221 --> 03:46.392
- SIX.
YOU ALWAYS FORGET ME.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.437
- WHAT MAKES ME THINK
THIS ONE WILL BE DIFFERENT?

03:49.520 --> 03:50.980
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
BLAME MY EX-HUSBANDS

03:51.064 --> 03:52.649
ON THE FAILURE OF MY MARRIAGES,

03:52.732 --> 03:55.193
BUT COULD IT BE THAT...

03:55.276 --> 03:58.196
I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT?

04:01.449 --> 04:03.660
- OH, NO.
- NO, NEVER YOU.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.788
- PLEASE. YOU BOTH HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN BLIND TO MY FAULTS,

04:06.871 --> 04:08.790
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:10.583 --> 04:13.211
I AM GOING TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH ALL OF MY EXES

04:13.294 --> 04:15.213
AND ASK THEM WHAT I COULD
HAVE DONE TO BE A BETTER WIFE.

04:15.296 --> 04:18.173
- EVEN HE WHO MUST
NEVER BE MENTIONED?

04:18.257 --> 04:21.177
- YES, EVEN HE.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.221
- HONEY, I'M NOT SAYING
THIS IS A BAD IDEA,

04:23.304 --> 04:25.390
BUT YOU ARE NOT THE BEST
AT HANDLING CRITICISM.

04:25.473 --> 04:30.061
- HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT--

04:30.144 --> 04:32.021
I MEAN, THANK YOU,
DEAR FRIEND,

04:32.105 --> 04:35.900
FOR YOUR WELL-INTENTIONED,
BUT WILDLY INACCURATE FEEDBACK.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.698
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WERE SO BRAZEN.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.700
- OH, RELAX.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.704
WHAT HAPPENS IN ORTHOPEDICS
STAYS IN ORTHOPEDICS.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.497
- JUST LIKE VEGAS.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.874
ONLY IF WE WERE IN VEGAS,
WE'D BE KICKING BACK

04:51.958 --> 04:54.544
IN OUR COMFY BEDS
AND ORDERING ROOM SERVICE

04:54.627 --> 04:58.881
AND TALKING ABOUT
WHAT WE'LL BET ON.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.385
- WELL, I SEE TWO
COMFY BEDS RIGHT IN HERE.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.053
- WE CAN'T DO THAT.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.263
WE'LL GET INTO TROUBLE.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.057
- WE'RE TOO OLD BROADS
IN A HOSPITAL.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.351
WHO'S GONNA ASK QUESTIONS?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.812
CLEVELAND CLINIC, BABY.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.066
- "SO IN ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION, VICTORIA,

05:17.150 --> 05:18.317
"YOU WERE A TERRIBLE WIFE.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.611
"YOU MADE ME FEEL
DIMINISHED AS A MAN.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.614
IT TOOK YEARS OF THERAPY
TO UNDO THE DAMAGE YOU DID."

05:23.698 --> 05:26.409
WOW.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.786
- OH, HONEY,
IT'S JUST ONE ANGRY EMAIL.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.288
- EMAIL?

05:30.371 --> 05:34.417
HE POSTED THIS
AS HIS FACEBOOK STATUS.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.086
- VICTORIA,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.255
THERE'S A REASON YOU TOLD US
TO NEVER SHOW YOU BAD REVIEWS.

05:39.338 --> 05:42.216
- YES, BECAUSE IF YOU NEVER
SEE SOMETHING TERRIBLE

05:42.300 --> 05:43.760
IT'S AS IF IT DOESN'T EXIST.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.596
YOU KNOW,
LIKE BACK FAT OR NBC.

05:51.809 --> 05:52.894
[phone chimes]

05:52.977 --> 05:54.562
- OH, WHO'S THAT?

05:54.645 --> 05:56.147
- IS IT HE WHO MUST
NEVER BE MENTIONED?

05:56.230 --> 05:58.066
- NO, IT'S JESSE.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.276
- OH, WELL, WE KNOW WHY
THAT MARRIAGE DIDN'T WORK.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.236
- HI, JESSE.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.074
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE WOMAN
WHO TURNED ME GAY.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.036
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS MIGHT GET A LITTLE HEATED.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.204
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST--

06:11.287 --> 06:14.123
- OH, WE'LL GIVE YOU
SOME PRIVACY.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.291
SO THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.667
VICTORIA CONTACTING HER EXES?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.252
I MEAN, SHE RUSHED
INTO ALL HER OTHER MARRIAGES

06:18.336 --> 06:19.962
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING.
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.465
THE LAST TIME SHE TOOK A LONG,
HARD LOOK AT HERSELF

06:22.548 --> 06:23.841
SHE SUED NEIMAN MARCUS

06:23.925 --> 06:26.511
OVER THE HARSH LIGHTING
IN THE DRESSING ROOMS.

06:26.594 --> 06:30.681
- OOH. THERE'S A CUTE GUY.

06:30.765 --> 06:35.645
A HANDSOME,
SLEEPING MYSTERY MAN.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.106
- HIS NAME IS ANDY GORDON.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.650
6'1". SINGLE.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.485
- SO FAR, SO GOOD.

06:42.568 --> 06:47.323
- AND HE'S BEEN
IN A COMA FOR 25 YEARS.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.869
- HE'S STILL SINGLE.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.497
- I BET HE'D LIKE A VISITOR.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.836
- [sighs]

06:59.919 --> 07:01.337
WHAT A TRAGEDY.

07:01.420 --> 07:05.299
- LOOK AT HIS
BEAUTIFUL COMA SKIN.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.468
YOU'D NEVER GUESS
HE WAS IN HIS 40s.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.345
- NO SUN, NO STRESS.

07:09.428 --> 07:13.891
IT'S LIKE BOTOX
WITHOUT THE NEEDLES.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.145
YOU KNOW, JUST LOOKING AT HIM,
I CAN TELL HE'S MY TYPE.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.148
DEEP, COMPLICATED,
EMOTIONALLY DISTANT.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.983
TRYING TO ESCAPE THE INFLUENCE

07:22.066 --> 07:24.527
OF AN OVERBEARING MOTHER
AND AN ABSENT FATHER.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.862
- OH, PLEASE, THAT'S NOT HIM.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.323
THAT'S YOU.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.992
NO, CLEARLY HE'S MUCH MORE
OF A BOY NEXT DOOR.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.493
AREN'T YA, ANDY?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.704
THE KIND OF GUY
THAT CAN LIGHT UP ANY ROOM

07:34.787 --> 07:37.748
JUST BY BEING ROLLED INTO IT.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.168
- DON'T LISTEN TO HER, ANDY.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.420
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU LIKE I DO.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.880
- YOU KNOW,
HE LOOKS A LITTLE CHILLY.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.673
WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK
THE NURSE FOR ANOTHER BLANKET?

07:45.756 --> 07:47.258
- AND LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE?

07:47.341 --> 07:51.387
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.433
- HEY, WE GOT YOUR TEXT.
WHAT DID JESSE SAY?

07:55.516 --> 07:56.851
- OH, HE SAID I MADE HIM
FEEL INVISIBLE.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.228
THAT OUR MARRIAGE WAS LIKE
THE VICTORIA CHASE SHOW

07:59.312 --> 08:02.106
AND HE WAS JUST
A SUPPORTING ACTOR.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.441
OF COURSE, WHEN I POINTED OUT

08:03.524 --> 08:05.359
THAT I'M STILL
SUPPORTING HIM FINANCIALLY,

08:05.443 --> 08:08.779
SUDDENLY <i> GLEE</i> WAS ON
AND HE HAD TO SCOOT.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.616
- HAVE YOU HEARD FROM
ANY OF YOUR OTHER EXES?

08:11.699 --> 08:14.744
- MM. NOT FROM ERNIE OR FROM HE
WHO MUST NEVER BE MENTIONED.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.579
- WHY MUST HE NEVER
BE MENTIONED?

08:16.662 --> 08:19.665
- BECAUSE HE BROKE MY HEART.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.958
BADLY.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.212
ANYWAY, NOW I AM GOING
TO VIDEO CHAT WITH CLARK.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.963
HE'S IN NAIROBI.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.425
- WHY ARE YOU TWO
IN HOSPITAL ROBES?

08:29.508 --> 08:33.554
- WE CHECKED IN.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.476
TURNS OUT A HOSPITAL AND
VEGAS AREN'T THAT DIFFERENT.

08:38.558 --> 08:41.562
WE HAVE CABLE TV,
ROOM SERVICE--

08:41.645 --> 08:44.273
- WELL, THERE MAY
NOT BE MALE STRIPPERS,

08:44.357 --> 08:48.110
THERE ARE A LOT GUYS
WITH GOWNS OPEN IN THE BACK.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.616
[phone rings]

08:53.699 --> 08:55.284
- HELLO, MOTHER.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.744
- OH, NO.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.620
IT'S NOT CLARK.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.913
IT'S HIS PARROT.

08:58.996 --> 08:59.789
WE'RE SWORN ENEMIES.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.125
- VICTORIA'S A BITCH.

09:03.209 --> 09:07.505
- I LOVE THAT BIRD.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.507
- YOU REALIZE HE'S A PARROT.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.175
HE ONLY REPEATS
WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.344
- OH, NOT THIS PARROT.
HE'S VICIOUS.

09:13.427 --> 09:17.431
- VICTORIA'S BAD IN BED.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.934
- THIS LITTLE BEADY-EYED
PERVERT USED TO WATCH US.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.769
- LAYS THERE LIKE A LOX.

09:21.852 --> 09:25.815
LAYS THERE LIKE A LOX.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.360
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF
MOVEMENT YOU CAN'T SEE, BARRY.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.279
- GOOD-BYE, MOTHER.
[click]

09:31.362 --> 09:33.322
- OH...

09:33.406 --> 09:38.160
MAYBE THIS WAS A STUPID IDEA
GETTING IN TOUCH WITH MY EXES.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.999
- HELLO, VICTORIA.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.167
- WHO'S THAT?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.502
- HE WHO MUST
NEVER BE MENTIONED.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.628
- OH...

09:52.758 --> 09:54.468
- OH, MY GOD, JULIAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:54.552 --> 09:55.803
- WELL, I GOT YOUR EMAIL.

09:55.886 --> 09:56.971
YOU SAID YOU WERE
IN THE HOSPITAL.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.180
- AND YOU FLEW ALL THE WAY HERE

09:58.264 --> 10:00.016
FROM LOS ANGELES JUST TO SEE ME?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.809
- YOU SENT THE EMAIL
AN HOUR AGO.

10:01.892 --> 10:06.022
I SEE YOUR GRASP OF TIME
AND GEOGRAPHY HAVEN'T CHANGED.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.357
NO, I WAS HERE
AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC ALREADY.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.026
I HAVE A TRANSPLANT
THIS AFTERNOON.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.988
- MM. DR. JULIAN CORTESE IS A
HIGHLY RESPECTED BRAIN SURGEON.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.198
- HEART SURGEON.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.200
- WELL, THE HEART
IS THE BRAIN OF THE CHEST

10:18.284 --> 10:20.703
SO I'M NOT ENTIRELY
WRONG, AM I?

10:20.786 --> 10:24.332
- YES, YOU'RE ENTIRELY WRONG.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.209
- YOU REMEMBER MELANIE
AND JOY, OF COURSE.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.045
AND--AND THIS IS ELKA
AND MAMIE SUE.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.379
- HELLO.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.714
- SO WHO'S GETTING
THE NEW TICKER?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.883
- THE SHAH OF KAFIRISTAN.

10:33.966 --> 10:38.512
IT'S ODD--HE'S SHARING A TINY
ROOM WITH A KID WITH MEASLES.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.558
- ELKA, WE SHOULD GET GOING.

10:42.641 --> 10:45.394
WE HAVE--WINK, WINK--
PHYSICAL THERAPY.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.984
- MAMIE SUE,
YOU DON'T SAY WINK, WINK.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.320
YOU JUST WINK.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.410
- [snaps fingers]
DR. CORTESE?

11:01.494 --> 11:05.456
I ENJOYED YOUR PAPER ON
CYTOMEGALOVIRUS SEROLOGY

11:05.539 --> 11:07.416
IN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.377
THANK YOU.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.556
WHAT? I LIKE TO READ
WHEN I'M GETTING MY NAILS DONE.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.106
- SO HOW LONG'S IT BEEN?

11:30.189 --> 11:33.275
- 20 YEARS.
- WOW.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.069
I GUESS THIS IS THE PLACE
WHERE WE TELL EACH OTHER

11:35.152 --> 11:36.654
WE HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.
- YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.531
[both laugh]

11:38.614 --> 11:41.742
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, VICTORIA.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.285
both: AWW.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.579
- YEAH, RIGHT.
WE'LL GO. YEAH.

11:47.706 --> 11:50.501
- SO, LET'S TALK.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.131
- A LITTLE LOWER, DEAR.

11:55.214 --> 11:59.510
- THE RESULTS CAME IN
FROM THE JOHNSON BIRTH AND...

11:59.593 --> 12:02.763
CONGRATULATIONS.
7 POUNDS, 5 OUNCES.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.099
- WE GOT THE UNDER.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.936
- I KNEW MOST OF THAT
WAS PLACENTA.

12:11.355 --> 12:15.693
- MAMIE SUE, I SEE YOU SIGNED UP
FOR THE SPONGE BATH WITH JOHAN.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.987
- I DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR A SPONGE BATH.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.281
- I COMPED YOU, DEAR.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.782
ENJOY.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.495
- I KNOW IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.998
BUT I REALLY AM SORRY FOR
HOW I ENDED THINGS WITH YOU.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.833
- THANK YOU.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.210
I-I APPRECIATE THAT.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.839
BUT RIGHT NOW I NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT I DID WRONG.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.133
I MEAN, IT CERTAINLY
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY

12:39.216 --> 12:44.305
THAT MY WORK WAS SO MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT THAN YOURS WAS.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.474
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:46.557 --> 12:48.350
THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.060
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A BRAIN SURGEON,

12:50.144 --> 12:53.147
WHICH YOU AREN'T...

12:53.230 --> 12:57.568
TO KNOW THAT I HAD A MORE
PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE WORLD.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.406
- YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.033
I'VE SAVED LIVES.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.202
I'VE TRANSPLANTED
THOUSANDS OF HEARTS.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.454
- AND I HAVE TOUCHED
MILLIONS OF HEARTS

13:08.537 --> 13:10.831
WITH MY MOVING PORTRAYALS
OF STRONG WOMEN

13:10.915 --> 13:13.918
OVERCOMING IMPOSSIBLE ODDS.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.421
- MY WORK WAS NOMINATED
FOR A NOBEL PRIZE.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.757
- AND MY WORK WON AN EMMY.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.635
- A DAYTIME EMMY.

13:22.718 --> 13:27.014
- THEY ALL FEEL
THE SAME IN THE DARK.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.892
- THIS IS HOW IT ALWAYS WENT.
YOU DRIVE ME NUTS.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.727
- YEAH, WELL, THEN
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

13:31.810 --> 13:36.023
- BECAUSE YOUR EMAIL, IT SOUNDED
LIKE MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME

13:36.106 --> 13:38.192
SINCE WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY NEED ME.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.027
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.946
- IF YOU REALLY
WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH

13:42.029 --> 13:44.198
ABOUT WHAT ENDED OUR MARRIAGE,
IT WAS THAT.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.242
I NEVER FELT NEEDED.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.452
A MAN NEEDS TO FEEL NEEDED.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.371
- BUT MEN HATE NEEDY WOMEN.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.748
- NO, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING HELPLESS

13:52.831 --> 13:55.960
AND MAKING SOMEONE
FEEL UNNECESSARY.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.755
YOU KNOW THAT,
UM, THAT IMAGE WOMEN HAVE

13:59.838 --> 14:01.757
OF A KNIGHT ON A WHITE HORSE?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.926
IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN
THAT WANT THAT.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.636
A MAN WANTS TO BE THAT.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.764
AND YOU PUT
THIS WALL AROUND YOU.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.599
I KNOW YOU NEED YOUR FRIENDS
AND YOU NEED YOUR WORK,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.936
BUT HAVE YOU EVER
REALLY NEEDED A MAN?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.942
UH...

14:20.025 --> 14:23.821
I'M SORRY IF THAT JUST HURT YOU.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.948
- ACTUALLY, YOU'RE NOT
THE FIRST EX-HUSBAND

14:26.031 --> 14:28.826
WHO SAID THAT TO ME TODAY.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.125
BUT I REALLY WANT MY NEXT
MARRIAGE TO BE DIFFERENT,

14:36.208 --> 14:37.960
AND--AND MAYBE I CAN CHANGE.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.462
- YOU CAN'T CHANGE.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.550
YOU SHOULDN'T CHANGE.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.513
YOU'RE AN AMAZING,
EXCITING, REMARKABLE WOMAN.

14:49.597 --> 14:53.350
IT MAKES YOU EASY
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH.

14:53.434 --> 14:57.479
BUT HARD TO BE MARRIED TO.

15:01.358 --> 15:04.361
- WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT
THAT HE'S A MORNING PERSON

15:04.445 --> 15:06.363
WHO PREFERS WHITE WINE

15:06.447 --> 15:09.491
AND LOVES TO TURN
A STRANGER INTO A FRIEND.

15:09.575 --> 15:15.331
- BECAUSE, CLEARLY HE'S A NIGHT
PERSON WHO LOVES RED WINE,

15:15.414 --> 15:18.334
HAS A SENSIBLE DISTASTE
FOR HUMANITY,

15:18.417 --> 15:21.670
AND WOULD TOTALLY GET MY POETRY.

15:21.754 --> 15:26.216
- NOBODY GETS YOUR POETRY.

15:26.300 --> 15:30.804
ESPECIALLY SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO
WATCH <i> SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE</i>

15:30.888 --> 15:34.016
AND <i> LOVE ACTUALLY</i> OVER AND OVER

15:34.099 --> 15:36.894
AND ISN'T AFRAID TO CRY
JUST A LITTLE EVERY TIME.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.813
- YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD MAKE HIM CRY?

15:39.897 --> 15:43.692
<i>PUNCTURED HEART,</i>
BY JOY SCROGGS.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.319
THE FROZEN BIRD--
- PLEASE, GOD.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.988
NOT <i> PUNCTURED HEART.</i>

15:48.072 --> 15:49.365
- FINE.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.617
HIS LIPS LOOK DRY.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.576
I'LL GET THE ICE CHIPS.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.577
- NO, I'LL GET THE ICE CHIPS.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.871
[monitor deactivates]

15:58.374 --> 16:00.084
WHAT DID YOU DO?
PLUG HIM BACK IN!

16:02.628 --> 16:04.380
[monitor beeps]
- OKAY.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.881
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

16:05.964 --> 16:09.218
NOBODY SAW.
NO HARM, NO FOUL.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.261
- [groans]

16:11.345 --> 16:12.596
- HE'S WAKING UP.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.431
- OH, MY GOD.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.975
I'VE REBOOTED COMA GUY.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.066
- HELLO?

16:24.149 --> 16:25.067
- HE'S COMING TO.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.360
THIS IS A MIRACLE.

16:26.443 --> 16:29.196
HOW'S MY HAIR?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.281
- NURSE.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.367
- DON'T WORRY, ANDY.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.537
WE'LL GET THE NURSE,
BUT WE WON'T LEAVE YOUR SIDE.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.415
- GO AWAY.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.917
- SORRY, JOY, HE JUST WANTS ME.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.544
- NO.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.129
I DON'T WANT EITHER ONE OF YOU.

16:45.212 --> 16:51.593
YOUR POETRY SUCKS,
AND I AM NOT A MORNING PERSON.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.929
- YOU HEARD EVERYTHING WE SAID?

16:54.012 --> 16:56.098
- YEAH, IT WAS TORTURE.

16:56.181 --> 17:01.478
LOOK, I'M JUST A GUY WHO LIKES
TO SKATEBOARD BEHIND BUSES.

17:01.562 --> 17:05.816
INSTEAD I GOT TWO MIDDLE-AGED
MOMS TALKING MY EAR OFF.

17:05.898 --> 17:07.693
- "MIDDLE-AGED"?

17:07.776 --> 17:09.403
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

17:09.486 --> 17:11.113
- I'M 19, DUDE.

17:11.195 --> 17:14.241
- REALLY?

17:16.410 --> 17:17.661
- OH, MY GOD.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.454
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FACE?

17:19.538 --> 17:21.457
LOOK AT THESE WRINKLES.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.125
OH, MY GOD, GRAY HAIR?

17:23.208 --> 17:28.672
- WHO'S THE MIDDLE-AGED MOM NOW,
COMA DOUCHE?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.799
- OH, IT'S A TEXT FROM ELKA.

17:30.883 --> 17:35.304
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.598
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:37.681 --> 17:39.516
- WE GOT KICKED OUT OF OUR ROOM.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.060
- AND I'M ONLY HALF-SPONGED.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.521
- WHERE'S VICTORIA?

17:44.605 --> 17:46.648
- SHE WAS GONE WHEN WE GOT HERE.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.777
- OH, NO.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.155
"I'VE GONE TO THE PRISON
TO END MY ENGAGEMENT TO EMMET.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.032
"I DIDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D STOP ME

17:55.115 --> 17:56.158
AND TRY TO TALK ME OUT OF IT."

17:56.241 --> 17:57.910
- OH, MY GOD.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.995
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HER
AND TRY TO TALK HER OUT OF IT.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.630
- I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.298
VISITING HOURS ARE OVER.
- OH, PLEASE?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.717
I NEED TO TELL HIM SOMETHING
BEFORE I LOSE MY NERVE.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.135
- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.720
- OH, THERE MUST
BE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.389
I-I MEAN, I'M SURE
THAT A HARD-WORKING,

18:19.473 --> 18:24.144
BUT POORLY PAID MAN LIKE YOU
PROBABLY WOULDN'T TAKE A BRIBE.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.312
- I WOULDN'T.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.522
- AND YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW ANYONE ELSE

18:26.605 --> 18:28.065
WHO WOULD TAKE A BRIBE?

18:28.148 --> 18:31.318
- I WOULD NOT.
- OH, PLEASE?

18:31.401 --> 18:33.320
- ALL RIGHT.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.364
I'LL ASK MY SUPERVISOR IF
THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.615
- THANK YOU.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.373
I SPECIFICALLY
TOLD YOU NOT TO COME HERE.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.833
- WHAT KIND OF FRIENDS
WOULD WE BE

18:45.916 --> 18:49.169
IF WE DID THE THINGS YOU ASKED?

18:49.253 --> 18:50.504
- NOW, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT JULIAN SAID,

18:50.587 --> 18:52.381
BUT YOU KNOW HE'S TOXIC.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.383
SO WHATEVER HE SAID,
DO THE OPPOSITE.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.219
- HE SAID I'M A REMARKABLE WOMAN
AND I SHOULD NEVER CHANGE.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.388
- WELL, THEN,
I'M GLAD I KEYED HIS CAR.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.014
WAIT, WHAT?

19:01.098 --> 19:03.267
- IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.562
JULIAN JUST MADE CLEAR WHAT
ALL MY EXES WERE TELLING ME.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.232
I PUT UP A WALL AROUND ME AND
I DON'T MAKE THEM FEEL NEEDED

19:10.315 --> 19:13.193
AND--AND I-I CAN'T
DO THAT TO EMMET.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.112
AND YOU BOTH KNOW
THAT I CAN'T CHANGE.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.947
- BUT YOU HAVE CHANGED.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.699
WE'VE SEEN YOU
WITH ALL YOUR HUSBANDS.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.242
AND YOU'RE DIFFERENT WITH EMMET.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.286
YOU'RE OPEN
AND VULNERABLE WITH HIM.

19:22.369 --> 19:26.248
- YOU'RE ALMOST
LIKE A NORMAL WOMAN.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.084
I WROTE A POEM ABOUT IT
CALLED <i> HEART SHADOWS.</i>

19:29.167 --> 19:34.256
THE BLEAK, DARK, OOZE--
- NOT NOW, JOY.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.259
LISTEN, WE SPENT ALL DAY
FANTASIZING THAT A GUY IN A COMA

19:37.342 --> 19:39.428
WAS EVERYTHING
WE WANTED IN A MAN.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.388
HONEY, YOU HAVE THAT FOR REAL.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.390
DO NOT THROW IT AWAY.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.600
YOU LOVE HIM.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.437
- I'M DOING THIS
BECAUSE I LOVE HIM.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.899
- I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.150
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.776
COME BACK TOMORROW.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.403
- NO, I CAN'T LEAVE NOW

19:56.486 --> 19:58.739
KNOWING THAT HE'S 20 FEET AWAY
AND I CAN'T TALK TO HIM.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.282
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.783
- NO, NO, NO, WAIT.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.951
LOOK, I NEED TO SEE HIM,

20:03.035 --> 20:04.077
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.455
I NEED HIM.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.750
- OKAY.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.752
MAYBE I CAN GET
A MESSAGE TO HIM.

20:11.835 --> 20:15.005
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

20:15.088 --> 20:18.133
- JUST TELL HIM I NEED HIM.

20:18.216 --> 20:19.301
- THAT'S IT?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.262
- [chuckles]
THAT'S HUGE.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.890
JUST PLEASE GO TELL HIM.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.813
I NEED HIM.
