WEBVTT

00:00.835 --> 00:02.892
I've been brought in from
the Metropolitan Police

00:02.899 --> 00:05.062
to lead the review
into the investigation

00:05.098 --> 00:06.705
of the murder of Alice Monroe.

00:06.727 --> 00:09.513
He had things entirely
under his control.

00:09.552 --> 00:10.961
Which makes me just think

00:10.961 --> 00:12.603
that this was not his first murder.

00:12.642 --> 00:14.174
Go back to your review, Stella.

00:14.229 --> 00:15.822
I don't want the two murders linked.

00:15.942 --> 00:18.280
This is the third murder
in three months, Jim.

00:18.336 --> 00:20.744
If we don't stop him,
he will kill again.

00:20.811 --> 00:22.358
There's someone to see you, ma'am.

00:22.359 --> 00:24.723
Rose Stagg, a friend
of Professor Reid Smith.

00:24.740 --> 00:27.038
I spent years interviewing
the victims of rape.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.850
I don't think anyone
ever felt worse after

00:29.878 --> 00:31.831
talking to me about their experiences.

00:31.875 --> 00:33.958
We have an e-fit from Rose Stagg.

00:34.233 --> 00:35.798
Could he really look like that?

00:35.918 --> 00:37.491
In his own mind, he...

00:37.558 --> 00:39.045
believes he has the right

00:39.067 --> 00:42.003
to decide who lives and who dies.

00:42.236 --> 00:43.284
Peter?

00:43.323 --> 00:45.318
No!

00:45.438 --> 00:47.912
They've managed to lift a
partial print from the scissors.

00:47.962 --> 00:49.958
We've run it through the
system and found a match.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.308
Paul Spector.

00:51.547 --> 00:52.901
Paul Spector?

00:54.626 --> 00:56.096
Detective Sergeant Anderson.

00:56.157 --> 00:59.215
I'm arresting you for the unlawful
imprisonment of Rose Stagg.

00:59.382 --> 01:02.034
Sally-Ann Spector, I'm
arresting you on suspicion

01:02.050 --> 01:03.926
of perverting the course of justice.

01:04.046 --> 01:05.407
Open the door!

01:05.973 --> 01:06.878
Katie...

01:07.067 --> 01:09.236
- Get off!
- Calm down, you are under arrest.

01:09.264 --> 01:10.624
- I need your car.
- What?

01:10.890 --> 01:12.111
You heard me.

01:14.974 --> 01:16.838
You know Paul Spector can go to prison

01:16.861 --> 01:18.153
for the things you're saying?

01:18.273 --> 01:19.638
We love each other.

01:19.835 --> 01:22.279
- You love each other?
- Completely.

01:22.326 --> 01:24.624
You asked if your husband was arrested

01:24.744 --> 01:27.153
for having sex with a minor. He was not.

01:27.322 --> 01:28.840
He was arrested initially

01:28.960 --> 01:31.598
for the abduction and false
imprisonment of Rose Stagg.

01:31.718 --> 01:33.301
He was subsequently further arrested

01:33.323 --> 01:34.864
for a serious sexual assault.

01:36.165 --> 01:37.701
And the murder of Joseph Brawley.

01:37.941 --> 01:39.059
I'm bleeding.

01:39.139 --> 01:40.319
What?

01:41.599 --> 01:42.860
I'll talk to Stella.

01:43.863 --> 01:44.871
No-one else.

01:46.038 --> 01:48.107
When was your first attack?

01:48.719 --> 01:50.894
Are there other victims
that we don't know about?

01:50.899 --> 01:52.967
Victims before Fiona Gallagher?

01:53.225 --> 01:54.278
No.

01:54.858 --> 01:56.478
Fiona Gallagher was the first.

01:56.888 --> 01:58.118
It's Eastwood, ma'am.

01:58.277 --> 01:59.479
Go ahead.

01:59.915 --> 02:01.959
Spector has come up with an offer.

02:02.649 --> 02:04.186
When are you coming home?

02:04.891 --> 02:06.158
Not for a while.

02:06.712 --> 02:08.051
I've got work to do here.

02:08.172 --> 02:09.681
Do you work for her?

02:10.911 --> 02:11.718
Sort of.

02:11.901 --> 02:13.340
There's nothing here...

02:13.553 --> 02:15.018
There's no sign of Rose.

02:16.088 --> 02:17.398
Go deeper, Stella.

02:18.455 --> 02:20.278
There's clearly something
going on between you.

02:20.279 --> 02:21.821
Let me give you some advice.

02:21.865 --> 02:24.337
If you haven't done it yet, don't.

02:24.906 --> 02:27.679
I've tasted both the
fantasy and the deed.

02:27.983 --> 02:30.123
The fantasy is way more piquant.

02:31.179 --> 02:32.639
Rose's car is here.

02:32.661 --> 02:34.566
I repeat, Rose's car is here.

02:39.719 --> 02:41.678
Jesus Christ, she's alive.

02:42.094 --> 02:44.426
There's another individual
on the edge of the woods.

02:44.439 --> 02:46.348
Er, someone we can't account for.

02:52.466 --> 02:53.402
Shit.

02:54.490 --> 02:56.395
- OK, don't move.
- Can that thing land?

02:56.417 --> 02:57.908
We've got three men down here.

02:58.028 --> 02:59.546
We need urgent medical backup.

03:00.128 --> 03:02.436
I can't land. The trees are too dense.

03:02.445 --> 03:04.206
Repeat, I can't land.

03:04.326 --> 03:06.239
- Jesus Christ.
- The trees are too dense.

03:06.542 --> 03:08.086
We're losing him!

- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:26.917 --> 04:30.224
32-year-old male,
gunshot wounds to abdomen.

04:30.391 --> 04:33.642
Breathing 35, pulse thready and 140.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.418
BP un-recordable.

04:35.721 --> 04:39.839
GCS nine, eyes two,
speech one, motor six.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.933
Central and peripheral
veins are collapsed,

04:42.944 --> 04:44.525
can't get venous cannulation.

04:44.558 --> 04:46.212
We're trying intraosseous.

04:46.961 --> 04:48.154
We're in.

04:58.481 --> 04:59.959
IO successful.

05:03.614 --> 05:06.056
0.5 litres saline being squeezed in.

05:08.598 --> 05:10.945
You should know the patient
is in police custody.

05:43.023 --> 05:44.266
He's fitting.

05:44.432 --> 05:45.625
How long?

05:45.819 --> 05:46.802
Two minutes.

05:53.128 --> 05:54.360
What is it?

05:54.799 --> 05:57.873
Man versus bullet, LUQ.
Doesn't sound too good.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.043
BP unrecordable, palpable pulse,

06:00.065 --> 06:01.697
GCS nine and falling.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.688
We've cleared a space
in Resus One for him.

06:04.705 --> 06:08.377
Draw up 100mg of ketamine and
100 milligrams of Sux, please.

06:08.405 --> 06:11.130
We'll need phenylephrine,
ephedrine, atropine handy

06:11.146 --> 06:13.361
and ten micrograms per millilitre of epi

06:13.383 --> 06:15.558
- drawn up also as rescue drugs.
- OK, sure.

06:15.569 --> 06:17.917
- Right, what's going on here?
- She's hypothermic,

06:17.939 --> 06:19.849
core temp 28.2.

06:19.871 --> 06:21.258
Paramedics got a line in

06:21.269 --> 06:23.279
and I got some bloods from one I put in.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.498
The junior doc did gas. PH is...

06:25.514 --> 06:30.049
7.1. PaCO2 9.0 PA.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.630
Base XS minus eight.

06:31.685 --> 06:33.999
Lungs are good, though. What's her name?

06:33.999 --> 06:36.438
- Rose Stagg.
- DC McNally.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.494
She's the woman we've
been searching for.

06:39.455 --> 06:40.758
Where was she found?

06:40.759 --> 06:42.918
In a forest, in the boot of a car.

06:42.962 --> 06:45.176
We think she was there
for at least four days.

06:46.147 --> 06:48.031
That's why her CO2's up,

06:48.034 --> 06:50.143
breathing her own recycled air.

06:52.790 --> 06:53.944
Rose.

06:54.621 --> 06:56.624
It's time to wake up, Rose.

07:02.140 --> 07:03.750
I can smell pear drops.

07:03.789 --> 07:06.169
- What are her ketones?
- 2.3.

07:06.289 --> 07:08.622
We can't move her until
an ICU bed is ready

07:08.639 --> 07:10.364
and her temp's going
in the right direction.

07:10.426 --> 07:12.889
- Do you want the Bair Hugger?
- Aye. Set it to 38.

07:13.311 --> 07:15.902
The FMO will need to see her
to process for rape evidence.

07:15.919 --> 07:18.793
Not yet and not in here. We
need to stabilise her first.

07:18.799 --> 07:20.253
Can I stay with her?

07:20.373 --> 07:21.998
Things are about to get messy.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.193
The gunshot wound that's coming in,

07:24.387 --> 07:25.902
we think he's responsible for this.

07:25.935 --> 07:27.494
She shouldn't catch sight of him.

07:27.522 --> 07:29.918
Plus we need to avoid
cross-contamination of evidence.

07:30.113 --> 07:31.201
Fine.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.831
Just keep out of the way.

07:37.472 --> 07:39.492
OK, everybody, listen to me.

07:39.508 --> 07:41.329
I'm the Tsar. All questions to me,

07:41.356 --> 07:44.048
all angst to me, all misery to me.

07:44.168 --> 07:47.127
Fran is on airway, Nurse
Bronagh is anaesthetic buddy.

07:47.139 --> 07:48.775
Daryl, you're on "C",

07:48.820 --> 07:51.562
Nurse Ursula is runner,
just because she is.

07:51.682 --> 07:53.071
Andrew, you're scribe.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.807
Everyone happy?

07:55.579 --> 07:56.722
Good.

08:01.233 --> 08:02.609
Come on,

08:02.953 --> 08:04.135
let's go.

08:22.154 --> 08:24.157
OK, guys, our patient's here.

08:24.196 --> 08:26.815
This is Paul, he's 32 years old.

08:26.859 --> 08:28.924
He was in police
custody when he was shot.

08:28.929 --> 08:30.472
Let's get him across.

08:33.464 --> 08:35.510
OK, on my count.

08:35.544 --> 08:38.397
Nice and easy. One, two, three.

08:38.639 --> 08:40.683
Let's break the scoop, please.

08:40.719 --> 08:43.758
Hit by a nine millimetre
police handgun from close range.

08:43.830 --> 08:46.694
Two wounds to abdomen,
left upper quadrant.

08:46.716 --> 08:48.541
Lateral wound I can feel the bullet.

08:48.559 --> 08:50.278
The other is hosing and deep.

08:50.295 --> 08:52.803
Can we get the Gendarmes
out of here, please.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.390
We're going to need those clothes.

08:54.424 --> 08:56.633
It was approximately 20
minutes before we got to him,

08:56.666 --> 08:59.346
by which time he was
unresponsive, GCS 9,

08:59.362 --> 09:01.479
and had lost a significant
amount of blood.

09:01.599 --> 09:03.053
Breath sounds bilaterally,

09:03.081 --> 09:04.713
heart sounds one and two, bit muffled.

09:04.735 --> 09:06.167
He has an IO in the right tibia.

09:06.172 --> 09:08.892
We've given him a litre of
warm saline in two boluses.

09:08.925 --> 09:12.388
BP 70, systolic, pulse 136.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.491
We couldn't get his
sats, he is too shut down.

09:14.507 --> 09:17.066
Have you given him anything
else? Morphine? Transexamic?

09:17.079 --> 09:19.218
Just the saline and
a gram of transexamic.

09:19.257 --> 09:20.777
Excellent work, thank you.

09:22.248 --> 09:23.238
OK, we're good.

09:23.239 --> 09:24.534
OK, let's roll him in case

09:24.540 --> 09:26.316
there's a bullet they
haven't told us about.

09:26.327 --> 09:27.909
OK, on my count.

09:27.987 --> 09:30.617
One, two, three. Roll.

09:34.822 --> 09:36.359
No exit wound, nothing here.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.019
- OK, roll him back.
- Grab his clothes first.

09:39.262 --> 09:41.837
OK. One, two, three, roll.

09:45.116 --> 09:48.737
BP 60 systolic, pulse 128 palp,

09:48.857 --> 09:50.124
no radial.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.441
Use the ambu bags. Help
him with his breaths.

09:52.747 --> 09:54.730
And ultrasound him, please.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.581
Gently, Fran.

10:23.217 --> 10:25.159
No pneumothorax.

10:25.279 --> 10:27.427
Daryl, any luck with
the bloods and line?

10:27.434 --> 10:28.766
Here's blood.

10:28.815 --> 10:31.235
Ursula, two units of House Red to start.

10:31.249 --> 10:34.038
Cross match me six
units in the lab, please.

10:34.086 --> 10:37.069
Good man, Daryl. Chop, chop now.

10:58.392 --> 10:59.862
Hello.

10:59.918 --> 11:01.430
How's he doing?

11:01.486 --> 11:03.237
I don't know.

11:04.148 --> 11:06.021
He's lost so much blood.

11:06.972 --> 11:09.095
It looks like he's dying.

11:09.215 --> 11:11.259
Tyler died at the scene.

11:11.573 --> 11:13.500
I know.

11:14.075 --> 11:17.502
I had Ged Green secure the
scene as per your instructions.

11:17.622 --> 11:19.915
The Ombudsman's SIO is on her way.

11:19.977 --> 11:21.252
Thank you.

11:21.253 --> 11:24.444
The Ombudsman's Office will want
to conduct a full investigation

11:24.479 --> 11:26.732
of the circumstances
surrounding the shooting.

11:26.733 --> 11:29.572
Why Spector was there,
why Tyler was shot.

11:29.573 --> 11:31.562
Well, Ferrington had no choice.

11:31.916 --> 11:34.552
Tyler emerged from the woods firing.

11:34.877 --> 11:37.735
I think the one round missed and

11:37.978 --> 11:40.114
went into the police car and
then the next three rounds

11:40.121 --> 11:41.939
hit Anderson and Spector.

11:42.341 --> 11:45.074
I'm not sure of the
precise order of shots but I

11:45.074 --> 11:47.869
am certain that Ferrington
only returned fire.

11:48.653 --> 11:51.733
- The shooting was fully justified.
- How is Anderson?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.042
I don't know.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.472
We had to leave him at the scene.

11:58.053 --> 12:00.653
A second rapid response
vehicle was on its way.

12:02.539 --> 12:04.670
Has Spector's family been informed?

12:05.485 --> 12:06.540
I'm not sure.

12:07.653 --> 12:09.065
Well, make sure that they are.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.606
What about Tom Stagg?

12:11.893 --> 12:15.219
I think the, er, officers are
on their way to see him now.

12:15.541 --> 12:17.053
And Rose?

12:19.492 --> 12:20.813
Alive.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.052
Are you in the car?

12:25.796 --> 12:27.578
I'm on my way to HQ.

12:28.593 --> 12:30.219
The Chief wants to see me.

12:30.773 --> 12:32.255
Keep in touch.

12:53.586 --> 12:56.289
Andrew, get on to the blood
bank, order four FFP, please.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.852
Ursula needs a gram of transexamic.

12:58.853 --> 13:00.390
We need anaesthesia!

13:00.418 --> 13:02.814
And fast! Bleep the surgeons again!

13:02.849 --> 13:04.626
None of their "we need a CT" shite.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.903
He needs to go straight to theatre.

13:06.907 --> 13:08.773
Have you got the O-neg up, Daryl?

13:08.790 --> 13:10.419
- Yeah.
- He's vomiting.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.409
Suction.

13:14.965 --> 13:18.130
On my count, one, two, three. Roll.

13:20.820 --> 13:23.231
And back, one, two, three.

13:24.177 --> 13:26.303
He needs tubed. Let's go.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.186
Bronagh, size 8.5 tube.

13:28.204 --> 13:30.373
MAC four blade. You ready, Bronagh?

13:30.379 --> 13:32.235
- One minute.
- Am I doing it?

13:32.581 --> 13:35.217
- Unless you don't want to.
- He's hypertensive and puking.

13:35.337 --> 13:36.623
Them's the breaks.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.453
I'll bail you out if it goes to shite.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.667
Can someone get a pillow for his head

13:40.702 --> 13:42.421
before Fran knocks his teeth out?

13:42.541 --> 13:44.710
- Will I do cricoid?
- Sure.

13:45.797 --> 13:47.828
Get that other blood up, Daryl.

13:48.413 --> 13:50.336
Sophie, you got squeezer drugs ready?

13:50.353 --> 13:52.699
I've got ten mics per
millilitre of epinephrine,

13:52.733 --> 13:54.812
100 mics per mill of phenylephrine,

13:54.813 --> 13:56.218
ephedrine and glycopyrrolate.

13:56.234 --> 13:58.887
The emergency box is ready.
Ketamine and Sux here.

13:58.898 --> 14:00.184
Good. Is that blood up?

14:00.186 --> 14:01.523
I've got a Green in his left foot.

14:01.529 --> 14:03.843
- I'll stick the other unit through here.
- You happy, Daryl?

14:03.865 --> 14:06.234
- Flushing well.
- OK, let's have quiet.

14:07.189 --> 14:09.082
- Ready, Fran?
- Ready.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.530
He's been pre-oxygenated.

14:10.535 --> 14:12.253
End tidal CO2 ready.

14:12.293 --> 14:14.013
Suction ready and under pillow.

14:14.351 --> 14:17.613
Cuff checked, tube lubed.
Boogie handy. Ready.

14:17.670 --> 14:21.212
BP 70, pulse 120. Sats now reading 93%.

14:21.213 --> 14:24.465
50 milligrams ketamine in. 100 of Sux.

14:49.364 --> 14:51.412
- He's fasciculating.
- Just wait.

14:52.011 --> 14:53.276
It should pass.

15:02.515 --> 15:03.693
Go now.

15:17.373 --> 15:20.384
Give him 100 micrograms
of phenylephrine, Daryl.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.653
Can you see the cords?

15:24.086 --> 15:26.057
- I think I can...
- Is that a yes or a no?

15:26.074 --> 15:27.966
It's a yes. Tube, please.

15:35.707 --> 15:36.939
Feels good.

15:37.621 --> 15:38.964
Cuff up.

15:41.473 --> 15:45.428
You've got end tidal,
sats 90%. Check BP there.

15:45.548 --> 15:47.537
Sophie, squeeze that blood in.

15:47.657 --> 15:50.932
Daryl, listen to the lungs
and stop looking pretty.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.097
Air entry in both axilla.

15:58.285 --> 15:59.551
Cricoid off, please.

16:00.117 --> 16:01.815
Bronagh, can you hold this?

16:03.093 --> 16:05.295
It's 22 centimetres at lips.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.542
Ursula, bag while I tie this in.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.889
BP 50 systolic.

16:11.060 --> 16:13.901
Give him 50 micrograms
of epi please, Daryl.

16:18.124 --> 16:20.089
Right, let's get him on the vent.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.853
Andrew, log the time.

16:26.648 --> 16:28.923
Where's that bloody surgeon?!

16:37.559 --> 16:39.706
Ah, Alex, good, right...

16:40.694 --> 16:42.715
This one's superficial.

16:42.759 --> 16:44.785
- Yeah, I can feel the bullet.
- Right.

16:44.818 --> 16:46.793
- That one's gone deep.
- OK.

16:49.002 --> 16:51.056
They're taking her up to the ICU, ma'am.

16:52.653 --> 16:54.956
Rose... Rose.

16:55.076 --> 16:56.604
You're safe now.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.763
Everything's going to be OK.

16:58.763 --> 17:00.822
Everything's going to be OK.

17:03.069 --> 17:05.532
You go with her. No
media, no photographs.

17:05.555 --> 17:06.733
Yes, ma'am.

17:21.653 --> 17:22.780
Gail,

17:23.491 --> 17:24.778
could you go to my hotel room

17:24.795 --> 17:26.397
and pick me up some clean clothes?

17:27.157 --> 17:28.856
I need something comfortable and

17:29.233 --> 17:31.780
- something to talk to the press in.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:32.179 --> 17:34.255
I think I left some papers
out this morning in the rush...

17:34.288 --> 17:36.145
- if you'd put them away?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:36.167 --> 17:37.372
Thank you.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.908
OK, let's move him, let's go!

17:43.858 --> 17:45.444
Is your boss on his way?!

17:45.478 --> 17:47.120
He's been fast-bleeped by theatre.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.485
Sophie, can you squeeze that blood in?

17:48.502 --> 17:50.488
It's hard to look at a systolic of 60.

17:51.232 --> 17:53.093
- Thanks, Joe.
- All right.

17:53.107 --> 17:55.143
- How is he?
- Dr O'Donnell,

17:55.326 --> 17:57.293
we have another gunshot
wound here for you.

17:57.657 --> 17:59.555
What is this? The '70s?

17:59.793 --> 18:02.685
- Who are you exactly?
- Detective Superintendent Gibson.

18:03.384 --> 18:05.542
Er, massive internal bleeding,

18:05.565 --> 18:07.874
he's lost half his
blood volume at least.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.042
Given where he was shot,

18:09.044 --> 18:11.098
I'm guessing he needs
his spleen in a bucket.

18:11.218 --> 18:13.256
- Will he live?
- Maybe.

18:14.649 --> 18:16.491
So he's the Belfast Strangler?

18:17.196 --> 18:18.561
Wow.

18:19.111 --> 18:21.332
We need to keep him
under guard at all times.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.979
Well, he's been given muscle relaxants

18:23.001 --> 18:25.154
and he's on a ventilator.
He's going nowhere.

18:25.420 --> 18:28.516
It's not the risk of escape,
really. It's for his own protection.

18:28.926 --> 18:32.013
There are people that would harm
him if they could, and my aim is to

18:32.133 --> 18:34.170
get him to court in one piece.

18:35.186 --> 18:38.825
Right now, the aim is to
get him to survive theatre.

18:39.796 --> 18:40.908
Right.

18:41.028 --> 18:44.173
Your other gunshot wound
I think is a colleague.

18:45.018 --> 18:47.188
- Look after him, please.
- Aye.

19:12.036 --> 19:14.227
And you're backing
Gibson to stay in charge?

19:14.347 --> 19:15.598
On balance?

19:16.380 --> 19:17.456
Yes, sir.

19:18.106 --> 19:19.893
No-one knows the case like her.

19:19.932 --> 19:22.652
She's got her man, Rose is alive...

19:22.653 --> 19:24.759
There's going to be a
media feeding frenzy.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.990
Get an MLO on board as soon as you can

19:27.006 --> 19:28.892
and keep Gibson away from the cameras.

19:28.893 --> 19:30.796
I don't want her making
any direct statements,

19:30.812 --> 19:32.338
conducting any interviews

19:32.405 --> 19:34.952
while inquiries into her
handling of the case are ongoing.

19:34.968 --> 19:36.355
Understood.

19:37.554 --> 19:39.940
Spector's first appearance
was moved to tomorrow.

19:39.962 --> 19:42.421
I'll contact the courts and let
them know he won't be appearing.

19:42.776 --> 19:44.812
Keep the PPS up to speed too.

19:44.813 --> 19:46.150
Yes, sir.

19:50.093 --> 19:51.733
I can manage her, sir.

19:52.815 --> 19:54.213
I promise that.

19:55.229 --> 19:56.782
Detective Sergeant Anderson

19:56.810 --> 19:59.253
has a gunshot wound
to the lateral aspect

19:59.285 --> 20:02.103
of the distal end of his
humerus with what looks like

20:02.126 --> 20:04.645
an exit wound just distal
to the antecubital fossa

20:04.645 --> 20:07.502
on the ulnar flexor
aspect of his forearm.

20:07.622 --> 20:09.804
He has some minor ooze around
the entry and exit sites

20:09.827 --> 20:11.491
when taking the dressing down.

20:11.552 --> 20:13.572
There's a lot of swelling
around the entrance wound,

20:13.573 --> 20:15.053
probably a large haematoma.

20:15.076 --> 20:17.159
- Do you have Mr Anderson's X-rays?
- Yeah.

20:21.443 --> 20:23.302
No bony injury,

20:23.896 --> 20:25.811
no retained metal by the looks of it.

20:25.832 --> 20:28.196
- He can get an MRI.
- The earliest is tomorrow,

20:28.213 --> 20:29.728
and that's with me pleading for it.

20:32.713 --> 20:34.493
So far so good, Mr Anderson.

20:34.521 --> 20:37.807
The X-ray reveals no fractures
and your pulses are intact.

20:37.927 --> 20:39.994
Now let's see you bend this wrist back.

20:45.183 --> 20:46.831
There but not great.

20:46.868 --> 20:48.195
Make a fist

20:48.595 --> 20:51.069
and open up your hand
spreading your fingers.

20:52.435 --> 20:53.495
Good.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.343
Can you feel me touch you there?

20:56.925 --> 20:58.572
It feels odd.

20:59.349 --> 21:00.932
Your function in your hand is good.

21:00.933 --> 21:03.492
However, I am a little
worried about the radial nerve.

21:03.493 --> 21:06.581
Where the bullet entered is not
exactly where the radial nerve lies,

21:06.620 --> 21:08.545
but swelling can compress it and clearly

21:08.573 --> 21:10.820
there is a lot of
swelling above the elbow.

21:10.892 --> 21:14.017
Reassuringly, with encouragement
you can extend the wrist,

21:14.050 --> 21:15.793
which is what the
radial nerve should do,

21:15.798 --> 21:18.284
but the altered sensation
is a cause of concern.

21:18.290 --> 21:20.188
So the plan is we'll clean the wound out

21:20.205 --> 21:21.925
and scan it tomorrow.

21:22.093 --> 21:23.778
How long will I be out of action for?

21:24.333 --> 21:25.592
I really don't know.

21:25.609 --> 21:28.328
We'll be in a better position
to judge tomorrow, post MRI.

21:28.384 --> 21:31.396
Well, weeks, months? For ever? What?

21:31.402 --> 21:33.350
I'm sorry. I really don't know.

23:10.663 --> 23:14.429
All I can tell you is that
he was shot in police custody.

23:14.813 --> 23:16.808
There's severe abdominal trauma.

23:16.928 --> 23:20.345
He's in a critical condition
and undergoing emergency surgery.

23:20.533 --> 23:23.508
There is a possibility that
he won't survive that surgery.

23:23.530 --> 23:25.613
Shot by a police officer?

23:25.621 --> 23:27.935
No, not a police officer.

23:28.453 --> 23:30.926
I'm sorry, I can't
say any more than that.

23:33.356 --> 23:34.571
Is that blood here yet?

23:34.804 --> 23:38.201
Two units, O negative, just ready
through the rapid transfuser.

23:38.223 --> 23:39.788
We're waiting on MTP.

23:39.826 --> 23:42.552
Christ, 60 systolic before we start?

23:45.015 --> 23:46.153
Drapes.

24:00.392 --> 24:01.774
Give me a minute, before you open.

24:01.796 --> 24:04.526
- His BP is in the toilet.
- More like 30 seconds, please.

24:04.646 --> 24:06.153
Make me a syringe of adrenaline.

24:06.214 --> 24:08.335
His pressure will bottom when
they open and decompress him.

24:08.539 --> 24:10.392
Sister, would you ring the
blood bank and remind them

24:10.416 --> 24:12.335
that Massive Transfusion
Protocol means now?

24:12.336 --> 24:14.836
And would you call Mr King and
tell him I'd appreciate his help?

24:15.225 --> 24:16.895
What's his pressure now? Can I start?

24:16.896 --> 24:18.882
80 systolic. Only going to get worse.

24:18.896 --> 24:21.311
- Yes, you can start.
- Scalpel.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.256
Two swabs.

24:35.472 --> 24:36.616
Suction, please.

24:41.810 --> 24:43.296
Protractor.

24:46.317 --> 24:48.016
It's a real, real mess here.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.597
He's slowing, systolic dropping.
Where's that adrenaline?

25:00.496 --> 25:02.398
He's cold. Let's push the fluids.

25:02.432 --> 25:04.313
Turn up the heat in theatre, please.

25:04.818 --> 25:07.093
There's another unit
ready for transfusion.

25:07.213 --> 25:08.788
The six FFP are here.

25:08.813 --> 25:11.515
Give him the unit and horse in
the FFP through that peripheral.

25:11.554 --> 25:13.673
- Sister, would you squeeze that in?
- Packs.

25:14.927 --> 25:17.213
We're losing here. BP and
pulse are the same. 40.

25:17.252 --> 25:19.200
Where are we at, Miss Morton?
We need to get control here.

25:19.216 --> 25:20.816
I can't see shit.

25:21.131 --> 25:23.745
Pulse rate is dropping.
We're really struggling here.

25:25.714 --> 25:28.256
Stop, stop, stop. There's
no pulse. Adrenaline, please.

25:34.736 --> 25:36.056
Start CPR.

26:03.568 --> 26:04.894
Peter?

26:06.997 --> 26:08.376
Mother?

26:14.916 --> 26:17.202
Daddy, look what I've found!

26:25.276 --> 26:26.496
Peter!

26:30.925 --> 26:32.695
Peter, come to me.

26:42.924 --> 26:44.096
Peter.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.154
Adrenaline is hitting.

26:54.274 --> 26:55.575
So, he's back?

26:55.576 --> 26:57.545
He's back. Carry on, Dr Morton.

27:04.716 --> 27:06.335
His spleen is shattered.

27:06.736 --> 27:08.561
I'm going to need a
second pair of hands here.

27:08.595 --> 27:10.095
Any sign of Mr King?

27:10.096 --> 27:11.415
He is scrubbing.

27:11.416 --> 27:13.389
BP now 60 and pulse 56.

27:13.411 --> 27:15.031
Time to act, we've got a window here.

27:15.070 --> 27:17.262
- Spleen?
- Yeah, I think so.

27:17.523 --> 27:19.456
Let's get it out and see
what else is going on.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.374
Mobilise the spleen, please.

27:22.216 --> 27:23.621
Scissors.

27:28.571 --> 27:30.416
- That's just coming now.
- Good.

27:33.143 --> 27:34.416
Clamp.

27:38.987 --> 27:40.856
Watch the tail of the pancreas.

27:43.531 --> 27:46.022
- Got it.
- Good.

27:46.771 --> 27:48.576
Scissors.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.495
Pressure rising 80 systolic,
pulse rising up at 72.

27:56.759 --> 27:58.216
Tie.

28:02.544 --> 28:04.136
Scissors.

28:06.692 --> 28:08.267
Diathermy.

28:09.733 --> 28:11.455
How are we getting on there, Adrian?

28:11.456 --> 28:14.495
Systolic stable at 90,
pulse stable at 102.

28:14.615 --> 28:16.695
He's on a trickle of norepinephrine.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.957
He's still behind but pH 7.2,

28:18.976 --> 28:21.136
lactate 4.5, though, that's improved.

28:21.256 --> 28:23.001
He's still quite labile.

28:23.313 --> 28:26.484
Temp is 34.8 degrees Celsius.
But he's making urine,

28:26.539 --> 28:29.606
- 40 mills in the last 15 minutes.
- He's very oozy.

28:29.616 --> 28:31.453
I think it's best to
pack him, warm him up.

28:31.702 --> 28:34.627
We need to fix that acidosis
and get his co-ag sorted out.

28:35.170 --> 28:37.223
I suggest putting him in ICU overnight

28:37.251 --> 28:39.876
- and having a re-look laparotomy tomorrow?
- Agreed.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.472
The hole's superficial.

28:44.194 --> 28:46.203
I can actually feel the bullet.

28:51.324 --> 28:53.744
Another trophy for the
forensic lab. Packs, please.

28:55.031 --> 28:57.255
There's an ICU bed ready
whenever you're ready.

28:57.462 --> 29:00.369
Medium soft. Do not unfold
them. Do not unfold them.

29:01.257 --> 29:03.499
Big soft in my hand, please. Big soft.

29:03.619 --> 29:04.856
Thank you.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.531
Take the bad look off
him up in recovery. Yeah?

29:16.534 --> 29:18.088
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:26.179 --> 29:28.876
Daddy's been in an accident.

29:28.996 --> 29:30.874
What kind of accident?

29:31.185 --> 29:32.783
A car accident.

29:33.127 --> 29:35.616
- What car?
- I don't know. I think, um...

29:37.406 --> 29:39.093
I don't know what car.

29:39.936 --> 29:41.176
Where is he?

29:43.376 --> 29:45.391
He's in hospital.

29:46.467 --> 29:48.215
Can we go and see him?

29:48.454 --> 29:51.356
The doctors are looking
after him now and

29:51.616 --> 29:53.070
he needs his sleep.

29:53.253 --> 29:56.045
Maybe tomorrow, if he's feeling better.

29:56.450 --> 29:58.059
Where is he hurt?

29:59.579 --> 30:02.787
I don't know. I think it's his tummy.

30:03.718 --> 30:07.120
- I really want to see him.
- Well, you can't. Not tonight.

30:08.024 --> 30:09.084
Olivia.

30:10.096 --> 30:11.376
Olivia...

30:31.904 --> 30:33.213
Hey.

30:33.452 --> 30:34.816
Hi.

30:41.310 --> 30:43.346
What have the doctors
said about your arm?

30:45.136 --> 30:47.231
There could be some nerve damage.

30:49.096 --> 30:50.816
May be the end of my career.

30:53.290 --> 30:54.539
Really?

30:56.321 --> 30:57.816
I'm sure it's not.

31:11.915 --> 31:14.384
Why did you run to him?

31:17.976 --> 31:19.312
What?

31:23.352 --> 31:25.916
The both of us were shot,
but you ran to him, not me.

31:25.936 --> 31:27.897
All your concern was for him.

31:29.051 --> 31:31.831
I could see that his
injuries were worse.

31:33.961 --> 31:35.176
And?

31:36.719 --> 31:38.933
You were crying out, "We're losing him."

31:40.637 --> 31:41.976
You sounded...

31:43.976 --> 31:45.216
... anguished.

31:48.228 --> 31:50.309
I didn't want it to end there.

31:51.663 --> 31:53.244
Not like that.

31:53.572 --> 31:57.616
No court case, no
sentence, no punishment.

31:57.622 --> 31:59.670
No closure for the families.

32:00.153 --> 32:02.023
I want him to live

32:02.550 --> 32:04.453
so that he can be tried and sentenced

32:04.464 --> 32:06.736
and spend the rest
of his life in prison.

32:12.455 --> 32:14.747
If I sounded anguished...

32:17.056 --> 32:18.338
... that's why.

32:33.794 --> 32:35.170
I have your things, ma'am.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.576
Thank you.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.418
If you need somewhere to park yourself,

32:41.424 --> 32:43.249
I have a room for you.

32:43.627 --> 32:44.816
Thanks.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.441
- You all right?
- Yeah, you?

32:55.513 --> 32:56.816
Not brilliant.

33:31.656 --> 33:33.975
He's had his spleen out
and his abdomen packed.

33:33.976 --> 33:35.644
Didn't look as if
anything else was perf'ed,

33:35.764 --> 33:38.135
but the surgeons want him
on co-amoxiclav and Flagyl.

33:38.136 --> 33:39.646
They're having a relook tomorrow.

33:39.896 --> 33:41.896
He's had a shed-load of
blood and products, though.

33:42.016 --> 33:44.496
Four units of O-neg and
ten units cross match.

33:44.529 --> 33:46.294
That's including the
two units hanging there.

33:46.414 --> 33:49.445
He's had eight FFP
and a bag of platelets.

33:49.565 --> 33:51.432
So, only twice his blood volume, then?

33:51.476 --> 33:52.880
No expense spared.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.263
Hey.

34:29.936 --> 34:31.599
How's the Strangler doing?

34:32.949 --> 34:34.746
I'm going up to see him in a minute.

34:37.088 --> 34:38.442
I've been aware of what's going on

34:38.458 --> 34:40.416
but I haven't really
been following it closely.

34:42.427 --> 34:45.179
Some of my friends have been
really caught up in it all,

34:45.951 --> 34:49.214
having alarms fitted and asking
random boyfriends to move in.

34:50.376 --> 34:53.496
Well, luckily, you're a doctor
and therefore never at home.

34:53.748 --> 34:54.815
True.

34:56.815 --> 34:59.656
I hadn't really thought of myself
as being at risk in that way.

35:01.256 --> 35:03.981
Then you look at the photographs and
you think, "They're just young women

35:04.020 --> 35:05.945
living their lives like I live mine.

35:07.210 --> 35:08.616
That could have been me."

35:11.228 --> 35:14.136
One of my best buddies is
a doctor in the military.

35:14.375 --> 35:16.922
Did several tours in Afghanistan.

35:17.456 --> 35:20.784
In the field hospitals,
casualties are treated solely

35:20.817 --> 35:22.876
on the basis of their clinical need.

35:23.514 --> 35:26.582
Badly injured Taliban treated
ahead of British casualties

35:26.582 --> 35:28.508
if their condition was more urgent.

35:28.531 --> 35:30.256
Same here in the old days.

35:30.539 --> 35:32.759
That didn't always
make him very popular.

35:33.336 --> 35:36.160
In truth, it rather fucked him up.

35:36.576 --> 35:38.441
But he'd still argue medical care

35:38.474 --> 35:40.689
has to be delivered
according to clinical need

35:40.711 --> 35:42.181
without discrimination.

35:42.856 --> 35:45.240
If he was here, he'd
tell us it's our duty

35:45.262 --> 35:48.064
to treat your man
humanely and protect them.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.182
Even if he is a murdering bastard...

35:51.904 --> 35:53.176
allegedly.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.569
The press are gathering.

35:58.816 --> 36:01.765
TV crews, all the main
channels, plus local TV,

36:01.776 --> 36:03.402
print and radio journalists.

36:03.576 --> 36:05.735
Quite a few web news sites too.

36:06.116 --> 36:08.258
I think we have to go
with a live interview.

36:08.563 --> 36:10.578
Have the victims'
families been informed?

36:11.066 --> 36:13.130
Gallaghers, Kays, Monroes?

36:13.779 --> 36:16.215
The announcement can't
come as a shock to them.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.841
They have, ma'am, yes.

36:18.096 --> 36:19.822
And Spector's family?

36:20.056 --> 36:21.992
Yes, ma'am, they've been notified.

36:31.276 --> 36:32.663
Right...

36:34.456 --> 36:36.210
... three key points.

36:37.742 --> 36:41.816
One, a man has been arrested
and has been charged.

36:41.936 --> 36:44.400
Two...

36:44.576 --> 36:46.747
- Stella.
- Sorry, sir, just one second.

36:46.969 --> 36:49.782
Rose Stagg has been found and is alive.

36:50.336 --> 36:53.906
Three, that the prisoner
was injured in police custody

36:54.089 --> 36:56.631
and then something about his condition.

36:56.975 --> 36:58.867
But beyond that,
investigations are ongoing.

36:58.896 --> 37:00.256
I need to stop you there.

37:02.036 --> 37:03.701
You won't be making the statement.

37:04.833 --> 37:05.910
What?

37:05.915 --> 37:07.902
The Chief Constable wants me to do it.

37:10.936 --> 37:12.552
Am I still SIO?

37:16.456 --> 37:18.173
Can you give us a second, please?

37:19.844 --> 37:21.342
Martina,

37:21.620 --> 37:23.706
it is really important that you monitor

37:23.717 --> 37:26.575
all press coverage for
accuracy and interpretation.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.961
Defence teams love to make allegations

37:28.978 --> 37:30.487
about what's been said in the media,

37:30.504 --> 37:32.701
particularly when misquoting facts

37:32.718 --> 37:34.343
provided by the police.

37:34.599 --> 37:36.016
Yes, ma'am.

37:42.776 --> 37:43.899
Well?

37:44.576 --> 37:46.008
Yes, you are.

37:46.835 --> 37:48.034
For now.

37:49.610 --> 37:51.296
I stood up for you, Stella.

37:52.734 --> 37:54.249
So I should think.

37:55.021 --> 37:57.616
I also told the Chief
that I could manage you.

37:59.632 --> 38:00.776
I see.

38:02.895 --> 38:04.693
Don't make this difficult for me.

38:06.940 --> 38:08.516
Well, you might want
to straighten your tie

38:08.527 --> 38:10.036
before you go on camera.

38:26.776 --> 38:28.825
Tom Stagg is in the
ICU waiting room, ma'am.

38:28.847 --> 38:29.935
Oh, thank you.

38:29.936 --> 38:31.966
Would you ask DC McNally
to bring me my bags

38:31.972 --> 38:34.202
- from the room I just changed in?
- Yes, ma'am.

38:43.813 --> 38:46.176
Has the Belfast Strangler been caught?

38:46.193 --> 38:47.958
That's the question tonight.

39:00.001 --> 39:01.282
How is she?

39:01.493 --> 39:02.614
Have you seen her?

39:02.842 --> 39:04.639
I've seen her briefly.

39:05.183 --> 39:06.787
I'm told she's stable, Tom.

39:10.555 --> 39:11.970
Thank you.

39:12.337 --> 39:13.602
Thank you.

39:14.896 --> 39:16.355
Shall we go in and see her?

39:16.475 --> 39:18.053
What's going on outside?

39:18.608 --> 39:20.162
Is that all for Rose?

39:20.822 --> 39:22.249
Don't worry about that now.

39:22.964 --> 39:24.529
Come on, I'll take you in.

40:06.336 --> 40:07.701
You're Rose's husband?

40:07.757 --> 40:09.655
- Yes.
- Come this way.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.686
Oh, my love.

40:51.976 --> 40:56.381
Here he comes!

40:56.501 --> 40:59.895
I am Assistant Chief Constable
Jim Burns and I have information

40:59.896 --> 41:02.485
relating to the Operation
Music Man Task Force

41:02.605 --> 41:05.350
and the serial murder investigations.

41:05.377 --> 41:08.388
I wish to confirm that a
32-year-old Belfast male

41:08.409 --> 41:10.664
has been arrested in
connection with the murders of

41:10.684 --> 41:15.422
Sarah Kay, Fiona Gallagher, Alice
Parker Monroe and Joseph Brawley.

41:15.478 --> 41:17.926
And also for the unlawful imprisonment

41:17.976 --> 41:20.492
of Belfast radiologist Rose Stagg.

41:20.527 --> 41:23.489
He was due to appear in court
in Belfast tomorrow morning

41:23.516 --> 41:25.563
to face these and other
charges, but that is

41:25.569 --> 41:29.114
no longer the case as he
has suffered serious injury

41:29.156 --> 41:30.765
whilst in police custody.

41:30.885 --> 41:33.245
- How did he come by those injuries?
- Why was he injured?

41:33.249 --> 41:35.215
The victim of a gun attack.

41:35.216 --> 41:38.112
His medical condition
is described as critical,

41:38.136 --> 41:40.336
his injuries life-threatening.

41:40.387 --> 41:42.239
Assistant Chief Constable,
how does a man get shot... ?

41:42.359 --> 41:44.313
Who's he talking about?

41:44.826 --> 41:46.768
- Don't do that!
- Katie.

41:48.038 --> 41:50.453
His assailant was shot dead
by police in the incident...

41:50.456 --> 41:53.576
It is Paul. Oh, my God!
I have to go to him!

41:53.616 --> 41:55.503
- Katie, you can't!
- I have to see him.

41:55.523 --> 41:58.284
- You're not allowed out!
- I don't care!

41:58.326 --> 42:01.274
Katie, you're on bail, you're
not allowed out at night.

42:01.296 --> 42:04.291
- Get out of my way!
- You're not allowed to see him!

42:04.296 --> 42:06.268
- Get out of my way!
- Katie!

42:08.994 --> 42:10.775
- Where are the keys?
- Katie!

42:10.776 --> 42:12.310
You locked me in!

42:12.372 --> 42:14.911
You're not allowed out
of this house, I said!

42:14.939 --> 42:17.048
- Fuck off!
- You're not allowed to see him!

42:17.076 --> 42:19.955
- Get the fuck off me!
- I'm calling the police!

42:20.295 --> 42:23.136
If you leave this house,
I'm calling the police.

42:24.172 --> 42:26.216
I don't know what's happened to you.

42:26.336 --> 42:29.034
Your father would be appalled
at what you've become.

42:32.896 --> 42:35.575
I am pleased to say that
Rose Stagg has been found,

42:35.576 --> 42:38.175
that she's alive and she's
in a stable condition.

42:38.495 --> 42:40.389
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank

42:40.416 --> 42:42.462
Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson,

42:42.490 --> 42:45.875
her team, and the public for
all their efforts in finding her.

42:45.903 --> 42:48.844
- Where is Detective Superintendant Gibson?
- Why isn't she here?

42:48.851 --> 42:50.876
- Won't she be making any statements?
- Detective Superintendant Gibson

42:50.890 --> 42:53.595
is doing what she does best: policing.

43:16.896 --> 43:18.669
I'm certain it's Paul.

43:19.779 --> 43:20.994
He's been hurt.

43:22.254 --> 43:23.976
How's he been shot? Who shot him?

43:24.002 --> 43:25.466
I don't know.

43:26.049 --> 43:28.552
The police, I suppose, I don't know.

43:28.785 --> 43:30.255
He's in hospital.

43:30.510 --> 43:31.816
He's where?

43:32.774 --> 43:35.056
In the General Hospital, I think.

43:35.176 --> 43:36.847
I really need you to go there,

43:37.208 --> 43:39.975
- find out how he is.
- Me? Why? Why can't you?

43:39.976 --> 43:41.319
You know why.

43:41.353 --> 43:43.184
The fucking bail conditions!

43:43.201 --> 43:45.120
- Why would they let me in?
- They wouldn't.

43:45.142 --> 43:47.773
- They wouldn't let me in.
- You don't understand.

43:48.827 --> 43:50.415
I think he might be dying.

43:50.535 --> 43:52.562
What? It's really difficult to hear.

43:54.371 --> 43:56.547
I think he might be dying.

43:57.152 --> 43:59.155
What do I... ? I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.831
Daisy, are yous coming?

44:00.831 --> 44:03.310
- Why are you being a bitch?
- What?

44:04.287 --> 44:07.603
Why are you being a fucking bitch?

44:08.213 --> 44:10.100
I'm not, I'm just saying.

44:10.310 --> 44:12.258
I don't know what I'm supposed to...

46:06.262 --> 46:10.632
_

46:51.387 --> 46:52.571
Mummy.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.713
- Yes?
- I can't sleep.

46:55.190 --> 46:56.616
Have you tried?

46:56.736 --> 46:58.420
Really, really hard.

46:59.107 --> 47:00.816
It's because you've got your light on.

47:01.166 --> 47:02.903
Can I get in with you?

47:18.740 --> 47:20.278
I'm thirsty.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.696
You've cleaned your teeth
so you can only have water.

47:23.741 --> 47:24.806
OK.

47:48.489 --> 47:51.486
_

48:53.416 --> 48:55.461
She needs her rest now.

49:00.736 --> 49:02.361
I've got something for you.

49:03.756 --> 49:05.829
Nancy was desperate to come.

49:06.890 --> 49:08.659
She sent you this.

49:22.594 --> 49:24.256
I'll see you tomorrow.

49:41.336 --> 49:43.765
Now, would you like me
to hang that up for you?

50:10.696 --> 50:12.335
Has she spoken to you?

50:12.398 --> 50:13.958
Has she told you anything?

50:14.136 --> 50:15.375
Did he... ?

50:15.376 --> 50:17.260
She's hardly said a word yet.

50:17.697 --> 50:19.456
It's too soon.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.789
She'll see the police
doctor in the morning

50:21.810 --> 50:23.898
and we'll know more after that.

50:24.376 --> 50:26.443
But she'll talk in her own time.

50:27.429 --> 50:30.616
I can't bear to think of her
alone with him for all that time.

50:31.348 --> 50:33.415
I can't bear to think of him...

50:33.535 --> 50:36.086
- laying his hands on her.
- Tom,

50:36.981 --> 50:38.500
try not to imagine things

50:38.507 --> 50:40.657
that very probably didn't even occur.

50:41.296 --> 50:44.729
I'm furious with myself for
not being there to protect her.

50:45.336 --> 50:48.175
Lying on the sofa, headphones
on, for Christ's sake.

50:48.176 --> 50:50.335
If I was in bed with her,
it would never have happened.

50:50.336 --> 50:52.135
Tom, you don't know that.

50:52.546 --> 50:54.335
It could have been far worse.

50:54.967 --> 50:57.312
Look at what happened with Joe Brawley.

50:57.936 --> 50:59.815
Why didn't she cry out?

50:59.816 --> 51:01.415
Or scream?

51:01.416 --> 51:03.135
Why didn't she fight him?

51:03.136 --> 51:05.055
Why did she go with him?

51:05.056 --> 51:06.482
- Tom...
- Do you know that Nancy

51:06.509 --> 51:08.583
saw them crossing the
street together, arm in arm?

51:08.583 --> 51:11.420
Tom, I need you to
listen to me right now.

51:13.924 --> 51:16.935
Men always think in
terms of fight or flight.

51:18.343 --> 51:19.772
In fact, the most

51:19.834 --> 51:21.275
common instinct in the face

51:21.291 --> 51:23.339
of this kind of threat is to freeze.

51:24.227 --> 51:26.296
If she didn't fight,
if she didn't scream,

51:26.341 --> 51:29.027
if she was silent and numb,

51:29.348 --> 51:31.596
it's because she was petrified.

51:33.336 --> 51:35.358
If she went with him quietly,

51:35.976 --> 51:38.582
it's because she was afraid for her life

51:39.381 --> 51:41.035
and not just her life,

51:41.296 --> 51:42.467
yours,

51:42.587 --> 51:44.964
and Nancy's, and the baby's.

51:47.336 --> 51:49.159
In that state of fear,

51:50.080 --> 51:52.294
she might well have been compliant...

51:53.176 --> 51:54.976
... she might well have submitted...

51:57.194 --> 51:59.576
... but that does not
mean she consented.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.176
Tom, the way you behave...

52:14.696 --> 52:17.653
... the way you approach your role

52:17.875 --> 52:19.485
as Rose's helper...

52:21.136 --> 52:24.590
... will either make her
experience better or worse.

52:26.456 --> 52:28.153
If you react badly,

52:29.418 --> 52:31.099
you will devastate her.

52:33.576 --> 52:35.039
Or you can be...

52:36.336 --> 52:38.840
a big part of her
healing and her recovery.

52:45.039 --> 52:48.018
What she needs from you right
now is to know that she is safe,

52:49.123 --> 52:50.620
to know that she's loved.

52:55.043 --> 52:56.416
Be patient...

52:58.639 --> 53:00.137
... be tender.

53:02.967 --> 53:04.665
Tomorrow's another day.

55:01.402 --> 55:03.136
You shouldn't be in here.

55:08.483 --> 55:10.115
Please leave.

55:46.903 --> 55:48.793
Is that you?

55:52.816 --> 55:55.214
Thank God you're here.

55:56.856 --> 55:58.296
I've been so worried.

56:08.093 --> 56:09.896
Thank God you're safe.

56:15.256 --> 56:17.182
Sweetheart...

56:17.687 --> 56:19.369
I'm glad you've come.
