Guys, that was a
great night, man.

01:47.058 --> 01:48.536
We were on fire tonight.

01:48.538 --> 01:50.192
Did you see how
the crowd reacted?

01:51.019 --> 01:52.410
Crowd?

01:52.412 --> 01:54.107
Yeah, that's
what I call it, the crowd.

01:54.109 --> 01:57.415
There was five people and
only two of them were awake.

01:57.417 --> 01:58.677
They loved us.

01:58.679 --> 02:01.244
Did you see they
had our t-shirts on.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.724
We're making a comeback!

02:02.726 --> 02:03.597
No, we're not.

02:05.163 --> 02:05.990
I'm done, man.

02:06.991 --> 02:08.600
Done?

02:08.602 --> 02:10.602
But we've got gigs lined up
for the rest of the year.

02:10.604 --> 02:11.690
What am I supposed to tell them,

02:11.692 --> 02:14.216
that Rat Poison is dead?

02:15.086 --> 02:16.697
Been dead a long time, Jack.

02:18.612 --> 02:22.135
Plus, we don't even make
enough money to break even.

02:22.137 --> 02:22.918
So, that's it?

02:22.920 --> 02:23.789
It's about the money?

02:23.791 --> 02:25.399
No, no, no.

02:25.401 --> 02:27.749
Look, I just can't fit
it into my schedule.

02:27.751 --> 02:29.882
My boss wants me to take
over the audit team,

02:29.884 --> 02:32.928
so I'm gonna be traveling
more and more and,

02:32.930 --> 02:35.716
Jack, I'm afraid we've
been rat poisoned.

02:37.413 --> 02:39.587
Guys, what's going on here?

02:39.589 --> 02:41.243
My son's in Little League.

02:42.505 --> 02:44.505
My daughter's got dance
competition every weekend.

02:44.507 --> 02:46.814
I can't do this late
night routine, man.

02:47.641 --> 02:48.468
Sorry.

02:49.556 --> 02:50.380
Peter?

02:50.382 --> 02:51.556
I'm tired, man.

02:51.558 --> 02:53.601
I want to have my nights
and weekends free.

02:53.603 --> 02:55.298
I want to work on my boat.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.519
We can still get together
and jam, just, like, for fun.

02:58.521 --> 03:01.481
Just like we used to do at
your dad's, back in the day.

03:20.891 --> 03:22.978
I don't get it, Dillon.

03:22.980 --> 03:24.284
Get what?

03:24.286 --> 03:26.506
The guys just
leaving the band.

03:27.724 --> 03:30.029
It's been our whole life.

03:30.031 --> 03:31.249
This sucks.

03:33.077 --> 03:34.773
Let me have a cigarette.

03:34.775 --> 03:36.252
I don't smoke.

03:36.254 --> 03:37.776
You got a damn
cigarette behind your ear.

03:37.778 --> 03:39.604
Let me see that one.

03:39.606 --> 03:40.561
No.

03:40.563 --> 03:41.693
And there's no smoking in here.

03:41.695 --> 03:42.609
You don't even smoke.

03:44.524 --> 03:45.958
You're such a bitch.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.788
I hate you, fuck you.

03:53.576 --> 03:54.751
I love you, man.

03:56.579 --> 03:58.318
Can I have another drink?

03:58.320 --> 03:59.756
How are you getting home?

04:00.583 --> 04:01.582
A car.

04:01.584 --> 04:03.671
What do you think?

04:03.673 --> 04:04.977
Let me have another drink.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.718
I think you're
done for the night.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.504
Don't you have the
early shift tomorrow?

04:10.027 --> 04:10.854
I don't care.

04:11.942 --> 04:13.594
Nothing matters anymore.

04:13.596 --> 04:15.074
Who cares?

04:15.076 --> 04:16.596
What about your wife?

04:16.599 --> 04:17.992
Sheila loves me.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.601
She will understand.

04:21.603 --> 04:23.127
We are solid.

04:25.216 --> 04:27.173
You're not driving
home, I got you a ride.

04:27.175 --> 04:28.304
Who?

04:28.306 --> 04:29.133
Me.

04:30.613 --> 04:35.268
Chrissy, my last
only best friend.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.530
I love you, man.

04:36.532 --> 04:38.401
Hey, man, I told you,
you're not my type.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.969
What?

04:40.971 --> 04:42.580
Rejected again by my friend.

04:42.582 --> 04:43.972
Not your type?

04:43.974 --> 04:46.845
I like my men
lean and successful.

04:46.847 --> 04:49.717
I still love you though,
buddy, that's why I'm here.

04:49.719 --> 04:51.589
He loves me.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.503
He really loves me.

04:53.505 --> 04:54.679
Give Jackie a hug.

04:56.508 --> 04:57.725
You need some help
getting him to your car?

04:57.727 --> 04:59.990
Yeah, Sheila's
gonna be pissed.

05:08.303 --> 05:11.434
At least he made it
home and onto the couch.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.262
Jack?

05:17.268 --> 05:19.791
Jack?

05:19.793 --> 05:20.618
Jack?!

05:20.620 --> 05:21.662
Oh, what?

05:21.664 --> 05:22.663
What, what?

05:22.665 --> 05:24.404
Shouldn't you be at work?

05:24.406 --> 05:25.187
What time is it?

05:25.189 --> 05:26.016
8 a.m.

05:27.148 --> 05:28.713
Shit, shit!

05:28.715 --> 05:29.888
I gotta open today.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.106
What time are you
supposed to be there?

05:31.108 --> 05:32.630
Now.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.066
Give, where are my
clothes, where's my shirt?

05:34.068 --> 05:35.633
I don't know.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.678
I got dressed without any help.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.811
Does little Jackie need
some help getting dressed?

05:39.813 --> 05:41.508
Come on,
stop doing that!

05:41.510 --> 05:42.378
Help me!

05:42.380 --> 05:43.815
Sorry, Jack.

05:43.817 --> 05:45.643
I have a meeting with my
director, I can't be late.

05:45.645 --> 05:46.994
Have a good day, sweetie.

05:49.561 --> 05:52.475
You bitch.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.740
You fucking bitch!

05:56.830 --> 05:57.657
Jesus.

06:14.412 --> 06:16.586
- Come on in, welcome.
- Thank you.

06:16.588 --> 06:17.805
- Hey, grab yourself a seat.
- So hungry.

06:17.807 --> 06:19.502
Sorry about the wait.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.721
- Hey.
- About time.

06:20.723 --> 06:22.114
I remember you.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.681
Hey there, hey.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.685
Welcome, good morning.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.124
Hello and welcome to
Caribbean Sweetness.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.734
What can I get for
you guys today?

06:33.736 --> 06:34.911
Vodka soda, please.

06:35.782 --> 06:37.259
Vodka soda
and you, ma'am?

06:37.261 --> 06:39.002
The same, but no soda.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.611
Great, all right.

06:41.613 --> 06:44.049
I'll go get your drinks while
you take a look at the menu.

06:44.051 --> 06:48.662
Holy shit, you're Jack
from Rat Poison, aren't you?

06:48.664 --> 06:50.751
Yes, I am, how
did you know that?

06:50.753 --> 06:52.884
We were at your
concert last night.

06:52.886 --> 06:54.668
You guys rock.

06:54.670 --> 06:55.627
Thank you!

06:56.803 --> 06:58.587
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

07:00.023 --> 07:01.327
Jack.

07:01.329 --> 07:02.458
We need to talk.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.808
You were late again today.

07:03.810 --> 07:05.418
Yes, I know,
but I got the doors open

07:05.420 --> 07:07.899
in time for the
customers to come in.

07:07.901 --> 07:09.465
Let's step outside, okay?

07:09.467 --> 07:10.858
I have some
customers right now,

07:10.860 --> 07:13.469
but let me get their drinks
and their order first.

07:13.471 --> 07:16.170
All right, but then
we need to step outside.

07:25.788 --> 07:27.048
Here you go.

07:27.050 --> 07:28.354
Thank you.

07:28.356 --> 07:29.964
Now what can I get for
you guys to eat today?

07:29.966 --> 07:33.011
I'll have the Cuban
and black beans, please.

07:33.013 --> 07:34.969
The same, but no black beans.

07:34.971 --> 07:35.796
Very good.

07:35.798 --> 07:37.450
Anything else?

07:37.452 --> 07:39.365
Uh, might as well set us a
couple more rounds, please.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.715
- Will do.
- Uh, one more thing.

07:41.717 --> 07:43.282
Who's playing this music?

07:43.284 --> 07:45.806
I've been listening to it but
I can't quite place the band.

07:45.808 --> 07:46.894
You like it?

07:46.896 --> 07:49.810
Yeah, it's a
different kind of sound.

07:49.812 --> 07:50.724
It's me.

07:50.726 --> 07:52.204
Rat Poison?

07:52.206 --> 07:54.815
No, just a song I wrote
and recorded in my basement.

07:54.817 --> 07:55.729
I'm digging it!

07:55.731 --> 07:57.296
Man, you are a talented dude.

07:57.298 --> 07:59.472
Can't wait to see
you at your next gig.

07:59.474 --> 08:01.779
Yeah, well, that's
another story.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.128
Excuse us, folks.

08:03.130 --> 08:05.957
Can I borrow your waiter
for just a minute?

08:05.959 --> 08:08.742
I'll make sure your orders
and drinks get out okay.

08:08.744 --> 08:10.918
In fact, I'ma let Gaston
take over for Jack,

08:10.920 --> 08:12.485
if that's all right with y'all.

08:12.487 --> 08:14.356
Is that okay?

08:14.358 --> 08:15.618
Gaston!

08:15.620 --> 08:16.881
Sir?

08:16.883 --> 08:17.838
Could you step
out here, please?

08:17.840 --> 08:19.492
Yes, sir.

08:19.494 --> 08:20.841
Gaston, could you take
care of these nice people

08:20.843 --> 08:22.277
- while I speak to Jack outside?
- Absolutely.

08:22.279 --> 08:23.106
Jack.

08:25.413 --> 08:26.673
Hello, guys.

08:26.675 --> 08:27.456
Dick!

08:27.458 --> 08:28.851
Get your dick out here.

08:29.983 --> 08:31.809
Why do we have
to do this here?

08:31.811 --> 08:34.028
I like our usual spot
at the Courtyard.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.856
Because Nancy works there.

08:35.857 --> 08:38.250
I can't have my friends
seeing us there.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.991
How would I explain
being there with my boss?

08:40.994 --> 08:42.907
What about Motel 6?

08:42.909 --> 08:44.256
Motel 6?

08:44.258 --> 08:45.910
You are the big
spender, aren't you?

08:45.912 --> 08:49.348
Well, I was getting our company
discount at the Courtyard.

08:49.350 --> 08:50.958
Hm.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.395
Maybe I should give you the
Motel 6 version in bed, then?

08:53.397 --> 08:55.267
Sheila, baby.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.356
Come on, what if
Jack comes home?

08:57.358 --> 08:59.793
If there's one thing
Jack is, it's predictable.

08:59.795 --> 09:01.490
He's at the restaurant.

09:01.492 --> 09:03.710
He can't leave 'til the
morning rush is over.

09:03.712 --> 09:04.972
We've got a couple hours of fun.

09:04.974 --> 09:06.756
Come here, tiger.

09:06.758 --> 09:08.889
I can't believe
you're firing me.

09:08.891 --> 09:10.673
I'm sorry, Jack.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.024
The doors were open on time!

09:13.026 --> 09:14.460
Almost.

09:14.462 --> 09:16.986
I need someone that I
can depend on to open up.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.901
The customers always complain
when you open the restaurant.

09:20.903 --> 09:22.598
They need to get a life.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.817
Five minutes, I've never been

09:23.819 --> 09:26.385
more than five
minutes late any time.

09:26.387 --> 09:29.910
Jack, this is their life.

09:29.912 --> 09:32.695
This is a part of
their daily routine.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.089
This is somewhere
they like to go.

09:35.091 --> 09:37.137
Why would you fault
them for that?

09:38.616 --> 09:39.877
I know, I know.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.009
All right, but I won't
be late next time.

09:42.011 --> 09:44.361
This is next time.

09:45.841 --> 09:48.015
Pick up your check at the end
of the week and good luck.

09:48.017 --> 09:49.277
Come on.

09:49.279 --> 09:51.714
I can't lose this
job, I need the money.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.936
And I can't afford
to lose customers.

09:55.068 --> 09:58.025
Sheila has a great
job, you won't starve.

09:58.027 --> 09:59.940
Yeah, right.

09:59.942 --> 10:01.333
Jack.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.860
Go do something
that you care about.

10:05.992 --> 10:08.777
Something that
gives you a reason

10:09.952 --> 10:14.914
to be somewhere and not just
a place to be opened up.

10:18.961 --> 10:21.919
Man, Sheila,
you are a tigress.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.877
Yeah, I know.

10:23.879 --> 10:24.706
How's your back?

10:26.316 --> 10:28.012
Love scars.

10:28.014 --> 10:29.361
Well worth it.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.015
I'm ready for another tear.

10:31.017 --> 10:32.277
Well, come here, Dicky.

10:32.279 --> 10:33.889
Let me leave my
mark on you.

10:35.978 --> 10:36.805
Shit!

10:42.767 --> 10:47.772
What the hell?

11:08.010 --> 11:10.882
- Shit, shit, shit!
- Socks, socks!

11:13.015 --> 11:14.582
Here, here, here!

11:16.497 --> 11:17.324
Head.

11:26.246 --> 11:28.028
Jack, what are you doing?

11:28.030 --> 11:30.117
Sheila, what are
you doing home?

11:30.119 --> 11:31.858
Why are you in bed?

11:31.860 --> 11:33.338
I had one of my headaches.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.035
What are you doing here?

11:35.037 --> 11:37.168
Must have been a
pretty bad migraine.

11:37.170 --> 11:39.735
It looks like it was
worse than the last one.

11:39.737 --> 11:41.824
Why are you at home?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.652
I got fired.

11:43.654 --> 11:46.438
Fired, Jack, how could you?

11:46.440 --> 11:48.483
Why do you always
assume it was my fault?

11:48.485 --> 11:51.051
What happened to
standing by your husband?

11:51.053 --> 11:52.748
It's always your fault.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.622
That's not true.

11:56.363 --> 11:58.145
Why
did you get fired?

11:58.147 --> 12:01.714
Because I was late
opening up the restaurant.

12:01.716 --> 12:03.455
It's because of that band.

12:03.457 --> 12:06.197
Jack, grow up and
quit the stupid band!

12:06.199 --> 12:08.068
But it's my life!

12:08.070 --> 12:10.070
It's all I ever wanted.

12:10.072 --> 12:13.421
What happened to you,
Sheila, you know that.

12:13.423 --> 12:15.423
You're not in
high school anymore.

12:15.425 --> 12:17.512
And dreams don't come true.

12:17.514 --> 12:18.646
At least not for you.

12:19.473 --> 12:20.907
Or us.

12:20.909 --> 12:22.082
Shut the door on your way out.

12:22.084 --> 12:23.694
My headache's come back.

12:29.178 --> 12:31.526
Do you think
I should leave now?

12:31.528 --> 12:33.311
I'm gonna need to
charge your rent tonight.

12:33.313 --> 12:35.141
Half a beer's not
gonna pay my bills.

12:38.144 --> 12:39.752
What?

12:39.754 --> 12:40.535
You okay?

12:40.537 --> 12:41.625
This is shit.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.191
It's just shit.

12:44.193 --> 12:45.105
Hey, I can get you

12:45.107 --> 12:47.020
another beer if that one's bad.

12:47.022 --> 12:48.630
What, no, not the beer.

12:48.632 --> 12:50.112
Good, you had me worried.

12:51.113 --> 12:52.201
What then?

12:54.116 --> 12:55.161
Nothing.

12:56.510 --> 12:57.639
Come on, Jack, you've
been sitting here for hours

12:57.641 --> 12:58.990
just staring at that beer.

13:01.123 --> 13:03.341
I don't know
what I want to do.

13:03.343 --> 13:05.212
I, I lost my job.

13:05.214 --> 13:06.433
The band's gone.

13:08.217 --> 13:09.651
Sheila's pissed.

13:09.653 --> 13:11.044
And?

13:11.046 --> 13:13.220
And nothing, that's just it.

13:13.222 --> 13:14.439
I've got nothing.

13:14.441 --> 13:17.485
All I've ever wanted
or cared about is gone.

13:17.487 --> 13:18.619
I've got nothing.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.708
Come on, Jack, there must
be something you can do.

13:22.710 --> 13:23.970
What?

13:23.972 --> 13:26.799
I mean, it's just
been me with the band.

13:26.801 --> 13:29.106
Music is all I have.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.890
Well, you could get
another restaurant job.

13:30.892 --> 13:33.155
You've got years of
experience doing that.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.547
Thanks.

13:35.549 --> 13:37.201
That makes me feel better.

13:37.203 --> 13:38.767
Really?

13:38.769 --> 13:39.812
With all of your experience,
you could get a job tomorrow,

13:39.814 --> 13:41.248
probably as a manager.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.120
Hours suck but it's good money.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.689
No, I hate the restaurants.

13:47.169 --> 13:50.518
Was a short term thing
that turned into 10 years.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.607
I just, I can't do it anymore.

13:52.609 --> 13:53.393
What then?

13:54.524 --> 13:56.263
I don't know.

13:56.265 --> 13:57.699
You could go back to school.

13:57.701 --> 13:58.572
College, maybe?

14:00.443 --> 14:02.356
I barely got out
of high school.

14:02.358 --> 14:04.053
I just wanted to get out.

14:04.055 --> 14:06.099
My grades sucked.

14:06.101 --> 14:07.318
You were a kid then.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.884
Now would be different.

14:08.886 --> 14:11.322
Might be something that grabs
your attention and interest.

14:11.324 --> 14:12.758
There's nothing
college can offer me

14:12.760 --> 14:15.021
that I would want to do.

14:15.023 --> 14:16.155
Where are you going?

14:17.156 --> 14:18.285
I know it's only half a beer

14:18.287 --> 14:20.246
but that half needs to come out.

14:27.078 --> 14:27.905
Oh, damn.

14:29.559 --> 14:30.995
An elephant shit.

14:32.432 --> 14:33.911
Does anybody flush anymore?

14:37.437 --> 14:38.960
Come on, little buddy.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.627
Rock-Enroll now.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.717
Are you a musician
looking for a new start?

14:58.719 --> 15:01.241
- Uh-huh.
- Is the band thing

15:01.243 --> 15:03.287
just not working anymore?

15:03.289 --> 15:06.290
- Yeah.
- Tired of the road trips

15:06.292 --> 15:08.117
- and low pay?
- Yes.

15:08.119 --> 15:11.512
Is your spouse
telling you to get a real job?

15:11.514 --> 15:13.645
- Yes.
- County Community College

15:13.647 --> 15:15.864
has your new career.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.267
That sounds great, Jude.

15:27.269 --> 15:31.315
I can go to school at night
and still work during the day.

15:31.317 --> 15:35.188
But my grades weren't that
great, so, I don't know.

15:35.190 --> 15:36.668
Do you think I can still get in?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.409
Jack, don't worry about it.

15:38.411 --> 15:41.107
I've worked with guys who barely
made it out of high school.

15:41.109 --> 15:42.413
I'll make sure you're approved.

15:42.415 --> 15:43.718
What about tuition?

15:43.720 --> 15:46.199
I don't think I could
swing that, I mean,

15:46.201 --> 15:48.288
I'd have to get a job,
save up some money.

15:48.290 --> 15:50.464
There's grants,
from the government.

15:50.466 --> 15:53.337
And I think from what you've
told me, you'll qualify.

15:53.339 --> 15:54.729
That would be awesome.

15:54.731 --> 15:57.428
I mean, it'd be a miracle
if it all worked out.

15:57.430 --> 15:59.081
Well, look, let me work on it

15:59.083 --> 16:00.431
and I'll get back
to you tonight.

16:00.433 --> 16:03.303
Aw, thanks, Jude, I
really appreciate it.

16:03.305 --> 16:05.087
Now I gotta go find a job.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.178
Let me know as soon
as you hear something.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.397
I don't know if you have the

16:10.399 --> 16:12.007
right qualifications
for the job.

16:12.009 --> 16:14.271
I can do it, just
give me a chance.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.924
Let me dip that
cage in that fryer.

16:15.926 --> 16:18.581
They will come out
crispy and not soggy.

16:21.149 --> 16:22.150
I don't know.

16:25.022 --> 16:26.326
Jake?

16:26.328 --> 16:28.285
Someone thew up in the
men's urinal again.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.985
Can you please go clean
it up for me, please?

16:32.203 --> 16:32.985
Sure.

16:32.987 --> 16:33.899
I'd love to.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.248
I'll be right on it.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.513
Aw, you're so
sweet, thank you.

16:39.994 --> 16:42.997
You know, chicks dig a
guy who play the guitar.

16:43.998 --> 16:45.391
I don't play the guitar.

16:46.392 --> 16:47.347
I do.

16:47.349 --> 16:48.914
I was in a band for many years.

16:48.916 --> 16:51.656
I have a collection of bras
and panties to prove it.

16:51.658 --> 16:53.310
So?

16:53.312 --> 16:54.528
What's her name?

16:54.530 --> 16:55.660
Patience.

16:55.662 --> 16:57.316
I can teach you how to play.

16:58.578 --> 16:59.490
Really?

16:59.492 --> 17:00.752
When I get done with you,

17:00.754 --> 17:03.102
she won't have
any patience left.

17:03.104 --> 17:05.411
She will be all about her Jake.

17:07.368 --> 17:08.282
You're hired.

17:10.372 --> 17:11.242
Hello?

17:12.113 --> 17:14.069
Hey, Jude.

17:16.204 --> 17:17.336
I'm just kidding, man.

17:18.598 --> 17:19.512
You're kidding me.

17:20.861 --> 17:22.121
You're shitting me!

17:22.123 --> 17:23.470
Oh, sorry.

17:23.472 --> 17:24.863
Awesome.

17:24.865 --> 17:26.257
Dude, this is great.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.300
Tomorrow?

17:28.303 --> 17:29.478
Yeah, I'll stop by.

17:31.437 --> 17:34.091
You're gonna help me pick
out my classes, too, right?

17:34.918 --> 17:35.919
Excellent.

17:37.486 --> 17:40.748
All right, well I'll
see you tomorrow, bye.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.402
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

17:42.404 --> 17:43.884
I got a job today.

17:45.233 --> 17:48.408
Yeah, I know, it's a great day.

17:48.410 --> 17:50.369
All right, see you
tomorrow, later.

17:56.853 --> 17:59.856
Chrissy, baby,
how's it going, man?

18:01.031 --> 18:03.164
Oh, gosh, I'm great, just great.

18:04.644 --> 18:07.732
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.211
Well, that's why I called you.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.475
We need to celebrate!

18:12.608 --> 18:14.436
Well, I'll tell you
when you get there.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.875
Oh, uh, how about
Dillon's at seven o'clock?

18:20.399 --> 18:21.615
Great.

18:21.617 --> 18:23.400
All right, I'll see
you when you get there.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.446
Bye.

18:33.150 --> 18:34.325
I'll have another one.

18:35.718 --> 18:37.370
Last one, Jack,
then I have to close up.

18:37.372 --> 18:39.546
Closing up, come
on, it's early.

18:39.548 --> 18:41.245
I should have closed by now.

18:44.074 --> 18:45.424
Are you sure Chris is coming?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.468
Yeah, where is Chrissy?

18:48.470 --> 18:51.253
Where is my bestest homo buddy?

18:51.255 --> 18:52.431
I need to buy him a drink.

18:55.477 --> 18:57.477
Chrissy!

18:57.479 --> 18:59.218
You're my best homo buddy.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.568
Cut the shit, Jack,
I'm not in the mood.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.831
And what's your problem
with gay men anyway?

19:03.833 --> 19:06.617
Whoa, what's your problem?

19:06.619 --> 19:08.270
I invite you to celebrate

19:08.272 --> 19:12.536
and you're hours late
and then you piss me off?

19:12.538 --> 19:15.452
You're right, it's
all about you, always.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.670
Chrissy, can I have a ride?

19:16.672 --> 19:18.846
Chrissy, can you
lend me some money?

19:18.848 --> 19:21.414
I'm tired of your shit, man.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.548
Whoa, whoa.

19:23.723 --> 19:26.682
Chill out, man, you
know I love you.

19:27.553 --> 19:29.553
Hey, get Chrissy a drink.

19:29.555 --> 19:30.858
I told you, I'm closing up.

19:30.860 --> 19:33.557
Can't you see he
needs some comfort.

19:33.559 --> 19:35.561
Just one, then I
need to close up.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.171
Yes.

19:39.173 --> 19:40.520
Okay.

19:40.522 --> 19:43.480
Now tell Doctor
Jackie what's wrong.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.959
I don't want to talk about it.

19:44.961 --> 19:47.745
Come on, you're
always there for me.

19:47.747 --> 19:49.400
Now let me be there for you.

19:51.707 --> 19:52.491
Well,

19:53.883 --> 19:55.666
Daniel left me.

19:55.668 --> 19:56.495
What?

19:57.887 --> 20:00.801
What a fucking bastard!

20:00.803 --> 20:03.545
Oh, what is his problem?

20:05.373 --> 20:06.243
He left you,

20:07.593 --> 20:09.638
he left you for somebody
else, I'm assuming?

20:10.987 --> 20:13.074
Yes, it was a man.

20:13.076 --> 20:14.034
His boss.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.079
Oh, wow, what a bastard.

20:18.081 --> 20:19.518
What a fucking bastard.

20:20.736 --> 20:22.042
Are you doing all right?

20:23.565 --> 20:25.609
Yeah, I'm all right, man, I
just, I didn't see it coming.

20:25.611 --> 20:26.958
I mean, I thought we were okay

20:26.960 --> 20:28.089
and then the next thing I know,

20:28.091 --> 20:30.527
my nuts get kicked in my mouth.

20:30.529 --> 20:35.534
Wow, wow, that really,
really, really, really sucks.

20:36.752 --> 20:38.317
It would kill me if
Sheila ever left me.

20:38.319 --> 20:39.623
I love her so much.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.278
She's such a good woman.

20:42.932 --> 20:44.151
You know what, Chrissy?

20:45.587 --> 20:47.197
Let Jackie give you a hug.

20:51.158 --> 20:53.462
Well, I guess it's
the thought that counts.

20:53.464 --> 20:54.725
You taking him home?

20:54.727 --> 20:56.291
Yeah, he better
have some great news.

20:56.293 --> 20:57.771
If he doesn't, Sheila's
gonna be pissed.

20:57.773 --> 21:00.469
She's gonna
be pissed either way.

21:00.471 --> 21:01.211
That's true.

21:58.268 --> 21:59.659
Abandon ship!

21:59.661 --> 22:00.793
Abandon ship!

22:03.317 --> 22:04.664
What the hell, Sheila?

22:04.666 --> 22:06.666
Are you trying to kill me?

22:06.668 --> 22:07.711
That's it.

22:07.713 --> 22:08.755
No more.

22:08.757 --> 22:10.148
I'm done.

22:10.150 --> 22:11.453
What are you talking about?

22:11.455 --> 22:12.631
What's wrong with you?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.676
What's wrong?

22:16.678 --> 22:17.505
What's wrong?

22:18.375 --> 22:19.984
Look at you.

22:19.986 --> 22:22.769
Passed out on the couch from
being out getting drunk again.

22:22.771 --> 22:24.771
Poor Chris had to
bring you home again.

22:24.773 --> 22:27.644
Man, Chris, I
forgot to tell him the news.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.950
You've got no job and
you're just out getting drunk

22:29.952 --> 22:32.083
and spending money
you don't have.

22:32.085 --> 22:35.086
Just chill for
a minute, Sheila.

22:35.088 --> 22:39.658
I was out celebrating my
new job and my new career.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.703
New job and a new
career, all in one day?

22:43.705 --> 22:44.878
How?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.184
What is it?

22:46.186 --> 22:48.447
Well, I'm going back to school

22:48.449 --> 22:51.800
and I'm the new fryer
guy at Carolina Drive-In.

22:53.454 --> 22:55.280
You will never grow up.

22:55.282 --> 22:57.456
School and making fries.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.459
That's your plan?

23:00.896 --> 23:01.854
I'm late for work.

23:05.466 --> 23:07.555
I want you out of my
house when I get home.

23:08.774 --> 23:10.861
Why would I do that?

23:10.863 --> 23:12.081
You don't listen, do you?

23:12.952 --> 23:14.562
You live in this dream world.

23:15.432 --> 23:17.606
I want a divorce
and I don't want

23:17.608 --> 23:19.696
to see your face
when I get home.

23:29.838 --> 23:33.622
Do you know a
good, cheap lawyer?

23:33.624 --> 23:35.712
Oh, shit.

23:35.714 --> 23:38.194
Please stand for the
Honorable Frank O'Brien.

23:39.935 --> 23:41.456
Good to see you, judge.

23:41.458 --> 23:42.459
You, too, Audrey.

23:45.811 --> 23:47.941
Next time, I'm buying.

23:47.943 --> 23:49.162
You got it, judge.

23:50.946 --> 23:52.339
Y'all be seated now.

23:54.384 --> 23:56.822
Jack, you need to grow
up and get a real job.

23:57.779 --> 23:58.867
Divorce granted.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.002
All rise.

24:05.918 --> 24:07.787
So that's it?

24:07.789 --> 24:09.310
Yep.

24:09.312 --> 24:10.790
That sucks.

24:10.792 --> 24:12.661
Well, hey, at least you
don't have to pay alimony.

24:12.663 --> 24:14.925
Pay, she should be paying me.

24:14.927 --> 24:16.753
She makes a ton of money.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.406
You suck as a lawyer.

24:18.408 --> 24:20.234
Well, I'm not a lawyer.

24:20.236 --> 24:22.889
You're supposed
to be trying to be.

24:22.891 --> 24:24.978
No hard
feelings, Jack.

24:24.980 --> 24:28.373
Hard feelings are
more than you ever had.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.289
Well, hard wasn't ever
really your forte either.

24:31.291 --> 24:33.726
You are such a bitch!

24:33.728 --> 24:36.078
And I see your
vocabulary hasn't changed.

24:37.558 --> 24:41.603
Well, she has a kick-ass ass.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.910
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

24:43.912 --> 24:45.782
So now what the
hell am I gonna do?

24:45.784 --> 24:47.348
Well, you're gonna
find a new girl.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.176
I don't want another girl.

24:49.178 --> 24:51.570
Come on, Jack, she's
the high school sweetheart

24:51.572 --> 24:52.789
that just got away.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.442
How am I gonna get her back?

24:54.444 --> 24:55.792
Well, that's the
least of your worries.

24:55.794 --> 24:58.055
I mean, you can't stay
on my couch forever.

24:58.057 --> 24:59.708
Seriously?

24:59.710 --> 25:01.928
I need a better paying job.

25:01.930 --> 25:03.887
I can help you, Jack.

25:03.889 --> 25:05.192
My name is Bruno.

25:05.194 --> 25:06.282
Bruno Sorentino.

25:07.370 --> 25:08.935
M.A.?

25:08.937 --> 25:11.024
Mister Academy, I'm
the head recruiter there.

25:11.026 --> 25:13.940
We can help you
get your wife back.

25:13.942 --> 25:18.118
Mister Academy, what is that,
some kind of butler school?

25:18.120 --> 25:19.946
How is that gonna help
me get my wife back?

25:19.948 --> 25:21.382
Look.

25:21.384 --> 25:22.906
Most marriages fail
because men don't know

25:22.908 --> 25:24.995
what women really want.

25:24.997 --> 25:28.215
Our academy can teach you
how to treat a woman right.

25:28.217 --> 25:30.914
Give her all the things
that she really wants.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.741
Yeah, right.

25:32.743 --> 25:35.048
I don't have the time
or money for school.

25:35.050 --> 25:36.441
Come on, Chris.

25:36.443 --> 25:39.270
We do have a
work-study program.

25:39.272 --> 25:41.489
Maybe you can qualify.

25:41.491 --> 25:43.143
Our finance department
can probably

25:43.145 --> 25:44.753
find you some money, too.

25:44.755 --> 25:46.886
What about on-campus housing?

25:46.888 --> 25:48.192
Chris.

25:48.194 --> 25:50.542
Your options are
limited, buddy.

25:50.544 --> 25:53.414
We can also help you

25:53.416 --> 25:56.591
find the man of your dreams.

25:56.593 --> 25:57.420
Really?

25:58.987 --> 26:00.900
Why don't both of you
stop by in the morning

26:00.902 --> 26:03.296
and we can discuss the details.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.514
- I don't know.
- We'll be there.

26:06.516 --> 26:07.256
Good.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.869
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

26:15.961 --> 26:17.134
Are you nuts?

26:17.136 --> 26:19.179
Calm down, Jack, I
mean, it won't hurt

26:19.181 --> 26:20.920
to hear what the
guy has to offer.

26:20.922 --> 26:23.357
I don't want to go
to some man school.

26:23.359 --> 26:24.663
Well, we're going
unless you want

26:24.665 --> 26:26.970
to find another
couch to sleep on.

26:26.972 --> 26:27.884
Seriously?

26:27.886 --> 26:28.843
Seriously.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.844
Jesus.

26:31.846 --> 26:33.239
I'm gonna regret this.

26:37.591 --> 26:40.374
Sign right here and
you'll be all set.

26:40.376 --> 26:42.724
A new semester starts Monday.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.684
Well, what kind of
guarantees do you offer?

26:45.686 --> 26:46.946
What if this doesn't work?

26:46.948 --> 26:48.252
Kid.

26:48.254 --> 26:51.037
There are no real
guarantees in life.

26:51.039 --> 26:52.212
I knew it.

26:52.214 --> 26:54.171
That being said,
I can guarantee that

26:54.173 --> 26:57.217
if you do everything
we say, study hard,

26:57.219 --> 26:58.958
well, then you'll
have a better chance

26:58.960 --> 27:00.786
than any other guy out there.

27:00.788 --> 27:03.051
It's all about
increasing your odds.

27:03.965 --> 27:06.009
I don't like those odds.

27:06.011 --> 27:09.447
Look, we have a long
list of happy clients.

27:09.449 --> 27:11.362
Let me show you around.

27:11.364 --> 27:14.321
You can see what we have
to offer for yourself.

27:14.323 --> 27:16.369
I'll even give you
a personal tour.

27:17.457 --> 27:18.371
That reminds me.

27:21.504 --> 27:24.986
This is our most
recent graduate.

27:26.074 --> 27:27.769
Dick.

27:27.771 --> 27:28.988
Yeah.

27:28.990 --> 27:29.991
Dick Lungvick.

27:32.037 --> 27:33.166
You know him?

27:33.168 --> 27:35.168
Yeah, I know him.

27:35.170 --> 27:37.390
He was one of our most

27:39.044 --> 27:41.000
gifted students.

27:41.002 --> 27:42.654
I bet.

27:42.656 --> 27:46.310
Only our top students get
our pictures hung out there.

27:46.312 --> 27:47.139
I'm ready.

27:48.575 --> 27:50.009
Ready for?

27:50.011 --> 27:51.358
Sign me up.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.881
But
there's so much more

27:52.883 --> 27:55.145
- I'd like to show you, Jack...
- I've seen enough.

27:55.147 --> 27:58.237
Okay, let's get on
with the paperwork.

27:59.281 --> 28:00.108
Chris.

28:01.501 --> 28:02.891
All right, I'm in.

28:02.893 --> 28:04.634
Somebody's gotta
look after Jackie.

28:06.245 --> 28:07.028
Excellent.

28:10.031 --> 28:12.597
Welcome to Mister Academy.

28:12.599 --> 28:15.469
My name is Bruno Sorentino.

28:15.471 --> 28:19.082
I'm the headmaster of
this great academy.

28:19.084 --> 28:22.476
All of you have enrolled
for your own reasons.

28:22.478 --> 28:25.175
But, ultimately,
for the same goal.

28:25.177 --> 28:30.225
To learn what a woman wants,
how to attract, and keep her.

28:31.313 --> 28:33.444
Jack, I'm not looking
for a good woman.

28:33.446 --> 28:34.749
I thought you said this
was a progressive school.

28:34.751 --> 28:36.447
Shh, I'm trying to listen.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.188
Are you trying to get
us in trouble already?

28:38.190 --> 28:40.103
Excuse me, is
there a question?

28:40.105 --> 28:41.713
Yeah.

28:41.715 --> 28:44.368
I'm not interested in women.

28:44.370 --> 28:47.066
Well, what are
you interested in?

28:47.068 --> 28:47.895
Men.

28:49.288 --> 28:51.592
Oh, I see.

28:51.594 --> 28:53.072
Tino.

28:53.074 --> 28:54.771
Can you address his concern?

28:56.991 --> 28:58.556
Christopher.

28:58.558 --> 29:02.257
We cater to all flavors here.

29:03.215 --> 29:05.084
You will find that
our workshops work

29:05.086 --> 29:09.175
for attracting men
as well as women.

29:09.177 --> 29:12.744
But we do take
special consideration

29:12.746 --> 29:15.181
for the needs of
our gay students.

29:15.183 --> 29:18.750
I teach all those
classes myself.

29:18.752 --> 29:19.533
Well, good.

29:19.535 --> 29:20.621
I was just making sure.

29:20.623 --> 29:22.234
It's my pleasure.

29:23.191 --> 29:25.759
I look forward to
helping you meet,

29:26.673 --> 29:30.068
capture the right man.

29:31.721 --> 29:34.157
Yeah, he totally wants me.

29:34.159 --> 29:36.985
- Happens all the time.
- Shut up and pay attention.

29:36.987 --> 29:41.120
We have a very aggressive
four-week program.

29:41.122 --> 29:44.123
It's designed to prepare
you for the field.

29:44.125 --> 29:46.823
This program is not
designed for pansies.

29:48.086 --> 29:52.264
You guys need to work hard,
be tough, and be ruthless.

29:53.395 --> 29:55.569
It ain't easy to get a woman.

29:55.571 --> 29:59.182
They all are calculating
and they have a game plan.

29:59.184 --> 30:02.185
You need your own game plan if

30:02.187 --> 30:04.143
you're going to win them over.

30:04.145 --> 30:08.756
Fortunately, we have a proven
track record of success.

30:08.758 --> 30:11.500
I can guarantee your success if

30:12.588 --> 30:14.112
you follow our process.

30:15.243 --> 30:16.982
Okay, now, I'd like
to introduce you

30:16.984 --> 30:18.853
to one of our other instructors.

30:18.855 --> 30:19.943
Vinny Sorentino.

30:20.857 --> 30:21.684
Vinny.

30:23.164 --> 30:24.513
Thanks, boss.

30:26.124 --> 30:26.994
Gentlemen.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.561
I've only got one rule.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.954
Nobody quits.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.088
If I tell you to do something,
I expect you to do it,

30:36.090 --> 30:39.135
no whining, no crying,
no complaining.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.660
You follow my instructions

30:42.314 --> 30:43.315
you will leave here alive.

30:45.186 --> 30:47.232
I'm just kidding.

30:48.233 --> 30:50.537
You will graduate with honors

30:50.539 --> 30:53.584
and you will have lots
of chicks wanting you.

30:53.586 --> 30:54.369
Fair enough?

30:55.588 --> 30:57.240
Good.

30:57.242 --> 31:01.026
All right, your schedules are
in envelopes in your chair.

31:01.028 --> 31:01.811
Any questions?

31:03.596 --> 31:05.073
Yes, what's your name?

31:05.075 --> 31:05.859
Oscar.

31:06.816 --> 31:08.296
What about a little competition?

31:10.080 --> 31:11.210
What do you mean?

31:11.212 --> 31:13.821
I need some extra incentive

31:13.823 --> 31:15.997
to beat out these other guys and

31:15.999 --> 31:17.956
get my picture on that wall.

31:17.958 --> 31:19.523
I see.

31:19.525 --> 31:21.612
Well, boss, should we tell them

31:21.614 --> 31:22.963
about A Lady's Place?

31:24.094 --> 31:25.311
I don't know.

31:25.313 --> 31:26.356
Maybe.

31:26.358 --> 31:27.924
Come on, what's the deal?

31:29.361 --> 31:33.319
Well, we have a little
rivalry with another school.

31:33.321 --> 31:34.451
Who?

31:34.453 --> 31:38.106
They call themselves
A Lady's Place.

31:38.108 --> 31:40.326
But they are just
mistresses in the making.

31:40.328 --> 31:41.199
Sweet.

31:43.549 --> 31:45.594
I can beat some
ladies at anything.

31:47.509 --> 31:48.380
We shall see.

31:49.903 --> 31:52.210
You guys have a lot to
learn to even come close.

31:53.385 --> 31:55.213
The woman that
runs that place is

31:57.171 --> 31:58.216
top notch.

32:00.609 --> 32:01.913
Now we're talking.

32:01.915 --> 32:03.262
Okay.

32:03.264 --> 32:05.264
You'll learn more
about them later.

32:05.266 --> 32:06.657
Vinny.

32:06.659 --> 32:07.442
Wrap this up.

32:08.922 --> 32:10.791
All right, gentlemen,
class starts tomorrow night

32:10.793 --> 32:13.316
and do not be late.

32:13.318 --> 32:16.103
We do not like it
when anyone is late.

32:17.278 --> 32:18.973
And you don't want to
find out what happens

32:18.975 --> 32:20.150
when someone is late.

32:22.718 --> 32:25.286
We'll see you tomorrow,
get the hell out of here.

32:43.826 --> 32:44.871
Here you go, boss.

32:45.915 --> 32:47.306
It's all there.

32:47.308 --> 32:48.483
Counted it myself.

32:49.615 --> 32:51.310
Good.

32:51.312 --> 32:53.575
Make sure this gets added to
the tuition receipts books.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.796
What a
bunch of wussies.

32:57.579 --> 32:59.146
You mean dicks.

33:00.408 --> 33:01.451
Whatever.

33:01.453 --> 33:03.237
The worst bunch of students yet.

33:04.586 --> 33:06.151
Who the hell cares?

33:06.153 --> 33:08.936
We got their money,
that's all that matters.

33:08.938 --> 33:13.595
Now it's up to you guys
to turn 'em into real men.

33:19.819 --> 33:20.733
Come in.

33:22.430 --> 33:24.648
You wanted to see me, sir?

33:24.650 --> 33:25.605
Yes.

33:25.607 --> 33:26.739
Sit down, Jack.

33:30.003 --> 33:31.352
We got a problem, Jack.

33:32.832 --> 33:34.962
Your tuition check bounced.

33:34.964 --> 33:36.224
It did?

33:36.226 --> 33:37.835
Oh, wow, I'm sorry.

33:37.837 --> 33:39.793
Hold on, hold on.

33:39.795 --> 33:41.447
I don't want another bad check.

33:41.449 --> 33:43.667
This one will be
good, I promise.

33:43.669 --> 33:45.756
I just need a day to put
some money into the account.

33:45.758 --> 33:47.714
Do you think
I'm stupid, Jack?

33:47.716 --> 33:49.237
No.

33:49.239 --> 33:50.066
Put that away.

33:52.242 --> 33:53.069
Where you going?

33:54.288 --> 33:55.374
I thought that
since I couldn't pay...

33:55.376 --> 33:56.421
Sit down, sit down.

34:00.512 --> 34:01.817
I read your file.

34:03.471 --> 34:05.384
I know what that
bitch did to you.

34:05.386 --> 34:07.212
What bitch?

34:07.214 --> 34:08.387
Your ex-wife.

34:08.389 --> 34:09.693
Sheila?

34:09.695 --> 34:11.911
No, that was my fault.

34:11.914 --> 34:13.568
She is a saint.

34:15.744 --> 34:18.225
You are so
pussy-whipped, aren't you?

34:20.096 --> 34:21.268
Listen.

34:21.271 --> 34:23.010
I think I have a solution.

34:23.012 --> 34:24.318
How about work for me?

34:25.188 --> 34:26.581
I had a recent opening.

34:27.842 --> 34:30.235
But I don't know how to
teach guys about women.

34:31.411 --> 34:32.889
Yeah.

34:32.891 --> 34:33.893
That's for sure.

34:35.068 --> 34:37.462
But I have another
job in mind for you.

34:39.072 --> 34:41.464
A little side business of mine.

34:41.466 --> 34:42.554
Doing what?

34:43.598 --> 34:44.599
Deliveries.

34:45.513 --> 34:46.425
Of what?

34:46.427 --> 34:47.469
Stuff.

34:47.472 --> 34:49.297
Don't worry about it.

34:49.299 --> 34:51.561
But you do this job

34:51.563 --> 34:54.087
and your tuition
will be paid in full.

34:55.304 --> 34:56.481
Are you kidding me?

34:57.482 --> 34:59.786
So, do you want
the job or what?

34:59.788 --> 35:01.397
Hell yeah!

35:01.399 --> 35:03.399
Thank you so much, sir.

35:03.401 --> 35:04.443
When do I start?

35:04.445 --> 35:06.314
Manny will let you know.

35:06.316 --> 35:10.408
He runs all my side businesses.

35:33.387 --> 35:36.257
Yeah, listen, Manny.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.913
Jack's our new delivery guy.

35:38.784 --> 35:40.131
Yep.

35:40.133 --> 35:41.090
Set him up.

35:43.658 --> 35:45.878
Don't worry about if
it doesn't work out.

35:47.575 --> 35:49.534
Well, then we'll have
one less student.

35:50.578 --> 35:51.492
Right, exactly.

35:56.018 --> 35:57.455
Tomorrow's delivery will work.

35:58.499 --> 35:59.544
Okay.

36:11.686 --> 36:14.600
Jack!

36:14.602 --> 36:16.996
Now, where were we?

36:21.522 --> 36:24.567
Jack!

36:24.569 --> 36:25.481
Jack!

36:25.483 --> 36:26.830
What?

36:26.832 --> 36:28.788
I'm watching TV.

36:28.790 --> 36:30.660
Yeah, you and the
whole neighborhood.

36:30.662 --> 36:32.662
It's late, go to sleep.

36:32.664 --> 36:33.532
I can't.

36:33.534 --> 36:34.753
I'm too excited.

36:36.581 --> 36:38.929
I got my new job, we
start class tomorrow,

36:38.931 --> 36:42.108
and my tuition is paid in full.

36:43.109 --> 36:43.936
About that.

36:48.244 --> 36:49.505
When are you getting
your own place?

36:49.507 --> 36:50.810
Come on, Chris.

36:50.812 --> 36:52.551
I gotta save up some money.

36:52.553 --> 36:54.118
I can't afford my own place yet.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.729
Well, how do you expect to
work two jobs and go to school?

36:56.731 --> 37:00.559
I don't know, don't worry
about it, I'll figure it out.

37:00.561 --> 37:01.604
I need my space.

37:01.606 --> 37:03.562
You're kinda cramping my style.

37:03.564 --> 37:05.521
I can't even meditate.

37:05.523 --> 37:08.698
And what's this job
that Vinny got you?

37:08.700 --> 37:10.049
Making deliveries.

37:10.963 --> 37:12.702
Delivering what?

37:12.704 --> 37:13.616
I don't know.

37:13.618 --> 37:15.182
Doesn't matter, go to bed.

37:15.184 --> 37:16.619
Turn down the TV.

37:16.621 --> 37:18.795
I need my sleep.

37:20.581 --> 37:21.756
Fine, okay.

37:23.453 --> 37:24.583
Good night.

37:24.585 --> 37:25.673
Good night.

37:49.741 --> 37:50.568
Hello?

37:51.873 --> 37:53.571
Oh, hey, Manny.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.572
What?

37:56.574 --> 37:57.444
Tomorrow?

37:58.706 --> 38:01.272
5 a.m., are you shitting me?

38:01.274 --> 38:02.971
No, no, I can do it.

38:04.843 --> 38:06.714
I just gotta be at work on time.

38:07.889 --> 38:08.716
Okay.

38:09.717 --> 38:11.499
Text me the address.

38:11.501 --> 38:12.328
Okay.

38:13.373 --> 38:14.853
See you at 5 a.m.

38:39.834 --> 38:40.661
Hello?

38:42.054 --> 38:43.314
Shit!

38:43.316 --> 38:45.229
Manny, I am so sorry.

38:45.231 --> 38:46.578
I'll be there in five minutes.

38:46.580 --> 38:47.712
I am so sorry.

38:57.243 --> 38:59.199
Where the hell have you been?

38:59.201 --> 39:00.725
I've been texting your phone.

39:02.596 --> 39:03.377
Oh.

39:03.379 --> 39:04.683
Forget it at home.

39:04.685 --> 39:05.817
Sorry, Manny.

39:15.740 --> 39:16.695
What is it?

39:16.697 --> 39:17.957
Don't worry about it.

39:17.959 --> 39:20.699
Just deliver it to the
address on the package.

39:20.701 --> 39:22.832
Okay, I have to
go to work first,

39:22.834 --> 39:24.311
so I'll deliver it later.

39:24.313 --> 39:25.748
No, now.

39:25.750 --> 39:26.751
But I'll be late.

39:30.537 --> 39:31.843
I'll give your boss a note.

40:00.610 --> 40:02.654
Ow, what'd you do that for?

40:02.656 --> 40:04.177
We're closed.

40:04.179 --> 40:06.745
Couldn't you have said
that without hitting me?

40:06.747 --> 40:08.138
No.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.793
I have a package to
deliver, I have to go inside.

40:10.795 --> 40:11.924
We're closed!

40:11.926 --> 40:13.186
We're closed!

40:13.188 --> 40:15.582
I need to go inside.

40:17.453 --> 40:18.716
Okay, fine.

40:19.934 --> 40:21.804
Bruno's gonna be pissed.

40:21.806 --> 40:22.894
Bruno?

40:24.199 --> 40:25.766
Are you his new delivery boy?

40:26.636 --> 40:27.507
Yes?

40:28.290 --> 40:29.768
You don't know?

40:29.770 --> 40:31.030
Yes, I am.

40:31.032 --> 40:33.511
Manny gave me this
package to deliver.

40:33.513 --> 40:34.773
Give it to me.

40:34.775 --> 40:36.601
No way.

40:36.603 --> 40:38.646
I have very specific instructions
on who to give this to.

40:38.648 --> 40:39.778
Heidi.

40:39.780 --> 40:41.824
Yeah, how did you know that?

40:41.826 --> 40:42.868
I'm Heidi.

40:42.870 --> 40:44.132
Yeah, right.

40:45.786 --> 40:46.742
You done out here?

40:46.744 --> 40:48.047
Does it look like I'm done?!

40:48.049 --> 40:49.396
Don't hurt me.

40:49.398 --> 40:50.748
Just come inside
when you're done.

40:52.358 --> 40:55.011
Can you sign something to
prove that I gave it to you?

40:55.013 --> 40:56.754
Do I look like UPS?

40:57.798 --> 40:59.278
All right, here you go.

41:00.192 --> 41:01.191
Ow, jeez!

41:01.193 --> 41:02.932
What are you, Fed-Ex?

41:02.934 --> 41:05.543
Don't drop my package.

41:05.545 --> 41:06.328
Thank you.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.770
Bruno's got a
new delivery guy.

41:26.958 --> 41:28.002
Hey, Jack.

41:28.829 --> 41:30.916
You have some customers.

41:33.007 --> 41:36.139
Hello and welcome to
Carolina Drive-In, ladies.

41:36.141 --> 41:37.444
Ladies?

41:37.446 --> 41:39.011
Do we look that old?

41:39.013 --> 41:41.840
Sorry, ladies, I mean, ma'am.

41:41.842 --> 41:43.668
So I'm a grandma now?

41:43.670 --> 41:46.279
Dude, you better quit now
before things get ugly.

41:46.281 --> 41:48.586
Gina, he is just being
a southern gentleman.

41:48.588 --> 41:50.416
Oh, I'm not from the South.

41:51.765 --> 41:53.767
But I have friends in the South.

41:55.116 --> 41:57.551
Bloody Mary and
I want a good pour.

41:57.553 --> 41:58.901
And put it in a go cup.

41:58.903 --> 42:00.206
Coffee, please.

42:00.208 --> 42:03.557
Yeah, coffee and
water, about a gallon.

42:03.559 --> 42:05.823
Very good, I'll be right
back with your drinks.

42:07.650 --> 42:08.867
Gina, why are you
mean to our server?

42:08.869 --> 42:11.609
I think I'm still drunk.

42:11.611 --> 42:13.045
Why do my legs hurt?

42:13.047 --> 42:16.005
Could have been all that
table dancing last night.

42:16.007 --> 42:17.136
Table dancing?

42:17.138 --> 42:18.921
Shit, I don't remember that.

42:18.923 --> 42:20.966
Yeah, I told you not
to get on the table

42:20.968 --> 42:22.054
with that skirt on.

42:22.056 --> 42:23.882
Was I at least
wearing underwear?

42:23.884 --> 42:25.536
When you got on
or off the table?

42:25.538 --> 42:27.146
Fuck, nevermind.

42:27.148 --> 42:29.018
Your divorce party
was much better

42:29.020 --> 42:30.062
than your bachelorette
party, though.

42:30.064 --> 42:32.282
I remember your divorce party

42:32.284 --> 42:35.285
and you got a little
cray cray as well.

42:35.287 --> 42:37.026
All right, here's your drinks.

42:37.028 --> 42:39.463
Now what would
y'all like to order?

42:39.465 --> 42:40.856
Dude, don't even try.

42:40.858 --> 42:43.162
Gina, stop it!

42:43.164 --> 42:45.208
What would you recommend
for a hangover?

42:45.210 --> 42:46.818
Cheeseburger.

42:46.820 --> 42:49.168
All the cheese, all the bacon.

42:49.170 --> 42:50.169
It always works for me.

42:50.171 --> 42:52.955
Done and fries, lots of fries.

42:52.957 --> 42:54.913
I'm gonna do the fruit salad

42:54.915 --> 42:57.831
with an egg white
omelet and wheat toast.

42:58.919 --> 42:59.831
Great.

42:59.833 --> 43:01.354
Very good.

43:01.356 --> 43:03.313
You're making me
look like a pig.

43:03.315 --> 43:04.836
Stop it, you are not a pig.

43:04.838 --> 43:06.535
You're just hungover.

43:07.797 --> 43:08.886
So now what?

43:12.106 --> 43:13.279
Hangover?

43:13.281 --> 43:14.108
Yep.

43:14.979 --> 43:16.630
That chick is just rude.

43:16.632 --> 43:18.067
Which one?

43:18.069 --> 43:20.243
The dark haired
girl with the hat on.

43:20.245 --> 43:21.635
Oh, that's Gina.

43:21.637 --> 43:23.899
She's a regular,
she'll grow on you.

43:23.901 --> 43:24.856
Yeah.

43:24.858 --> 43:26.989
Like mold on stale bread.

43:27.817 --> 43:29.295
Just be nice.

43:29.297 --> 43:30.949
She tips well.

43:30.951 --> 43:32.344
Unless you piss her off.

43:33.475 --> 43:34.302
Damn.

43:36.478 --> 43:38.174
I tore that shit up.

43:38.176 --> 43:39.653
Yes, you did.

43:39.655 --> 43:41.525
I'm gonna hit the gym later.

43:41.527 --> 43:43.048
What about the interview?

43:43.050 --> 43:44.615
I gotta hit the gym first,

43:44.617 --> 43:47.313
relieve some stress and
work off these fries.

43:47.315 --> 43:48.271
Then the interview.

43:48.273 --> 43:49.620
Are you ready?

43:49.622 --> 43:52.971
Tidy up, clean up, you
know you gotta speed up,

43:52.973 --> 43:56.322
take a sip, pep up, and
you'll have to get up.

43:56.324 --> 43:58.585
Hey, that's pretty good.

43:58.587 --> 43:59.499
What's it for?

43:59.501 --> 44:00.938
Menstrual cramps commercial.

44:03.114 --> 44:03.939
I don't get it.

44:03.941 --> 44:04.765
Is that our bill?

44:04.767 --> 44:06.028
Yep.

44:06.030 --> 44:07.116
Unless you guys
want anything else.

44:07.118 --> 44:08.247
Desserts?

44:08.249 --> 44:09.422
No, thank you.

44:09.424 --> 44:10.858
It's been my
pleasure serving you.

44:10.860 --> 44:12.077
Thank you.

44:12.079 --> 44:13.951
You must enjoy having
your teeth drilled.

44:16.823 --> 44:18.127
I'll get this.

44:18.129 --> 44:20.131
Oh, no, you can
pay after you get a job.

44:23.351 --> 44:24.133
You ready?

44:24.135 --> 44:25.005
Yeah, let's go.

44:28.966 --> 44:29.877
What a bitch!

44:29.879 --> 44:31.227
I couldn't do anything right.

44:31.229 --> 44:32.880
No one can.

44:32.882 --> 44:34.230
Her husband recently left her.

44:34.232 --> 44:35.492
Oh, wow.

44:35.494 --> 44:37.233
For her sister.

44:37.235 --> 44:38.018
Ouch.

44:51.466 --> 44:52.900
Well, I'll be damned.

44:52.902 --> 44:53.816
Told you so.

44:56.036 --> 44:57.688
Men.

44:57.690 --> 45:00.432
This is your first
practical test.

45:03.174 --> 45:05.132
What the hell?

45:07.004 --> 45:08.046
You're late, Jack.

45:08.048 --> 45:09.265
Sorry, I got
out of work late...

45:09.267 --> 45:10.746
Oh, don't you.

45:12.052 --> 45:14.835
Lateness will not be tolerated.

45:14.837 --> 45:16.230
- But...
- No buts.

45:18.493 --> 45:19.755
Drop and give me 20.

45:30.331 --> 45:34.640
As I was saying, this is
your first practical test.

45:35.423 --> 45:38.076
This skill will save your life

45:38.078 --> 45:41.560
and your family Jules
when done effectively.

45:42.387 --> 45:43.734
Now.

45:43.736 --> 45:44.563
Let's get ready.

45:45.651 --> 45:46.478
Attention.

45:48.784 --> 45:49.957
There's a knock at the door.

45:49.959 --> 45:51.481
Stop what you're doing.

45:51.483 --> 45:53.396
Drop on the floor.

45:53.398 --> 45:54.921
Roll under the bed.

45:57.097 --> 45:58.142
Back to one.

46:00.144 --> 46:01.493
Back to one, let's go.

46:03.190 --> 46:04.233
Right.

46:04.235 --> 46:05.538
Attention.

46:05.540 --> 46:07.062
There's
a knock at the door.

46:07.064 --> 46:08.846
Stop what you're doing.

46:08.848 --> 46:10.326
Drop to the floor.

46:10.328 --> 46:12.328
Roll under the bed.

46:12.330 --> 46:15.287
Yeah, this drop, stop,
and roll technique,

46:15.289 --> 46:18.290
when mastered will save
your butt every time

46:18.292 --> 46:22.033
that boyfriend or husband
shows up unexpectedly.

46:22.035 --> 46:24.688
Now, let's do it again.

46:24.690 --> 46:26.516
Come on, let's go.

46:26.518 --> 46:28.126
Move those titties.

46:28.128 --> 46:29.780
All right, yeah.

46:29.782 --> 46:31.129
All right.

46:31.131 --> 46:32.263
Attention.

46:33.133 --> 46:34.176
There's
a knock at the door.

46:34.178 --> 46:35.829
Stop what you're doing.

46:35.831 --> 46:36.613
Drop to the floor.

46:36.615 --> 46:38.095
Roll under the bed.

46:39.792 --> 46:42.140
All right, come
on, man up, guys.

46:42.142 --> 46:44.229
Work through the pain.

46:44.231 --> 46:47.016
Better to have a bruised
leg than a fist to the face.

46:47.974 --> 46:48.975
Let's do it again.

46:51.760 --> 46:53.586
I counted it already.

46:53.588 --> 46:55.588
That's why you pay me, isn't it?

46:55.590 --> 46:57.634
Vinny, I know, I just love

46:57.636 --> 47:00.289
the feel of fresh
cash in my hands.

47:00.291 --> 47:01.640
Yeah, it feels good.

47:03.032 --> 47:05.555
Is Manny working on the books?

47:05.557 --> 47:07.731
Yeah, he's adding it up now.

47:07.733 --> 47:09.213
Making sure everything adds up.

47:10.344 --> 47:11.952
Correctly.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.696
Hey, you know, I've
been meaning to ask you.

47:16.220 --> 47:17.741
How the newbies doing?

47:18.831 --> 47:20.483
They've been working hard.

47:20.485 --> 47:22.441
Yeah, they got lots of bruises.

47:22.443 --> 47:25.836
Manny's been teaching them
about endurance in the bedroom.

47:25.838 --> 47:27.446
I love that session.

47:27.448 --> 47:29.187
You got the doc on call?

47:29.189 --> 47:30.625
Yeah, he's ready.

47:31.887 --> 47:33.802
Just in case.

47:34.847 --> 47:36.544
White or yellow?

47:37.415 --> 47:39.066
White.

47:39.068 --> 47:40.896
The yellow takes too long.

47:42.202 --> 47:43.201
Good.

47:43.203 --> 47:44.248
Good.

47:57.565 --> 47:58.825
Guys!

47:58.827 --> 48:00.175
Come on.

48:00.177 --> 48:02.179
It's more important that
the woman is satisfied.

48:09.490 --> 48:11.969
I got to pee but I can't,
what am I supposed to do?

48:11.971 --> 48:13.275
Not pee.

48:13.277 --> 48:14.278
Get out of here.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.326
Damn, I feel like Superman.

48:21.328 --> 48:22.371
How about you?

48:22.373 --> 48:23.287
I feel good.

48:24.288 --> 48:26.418
Look out, ladies, here I come!

48:26.420 --> 48:28.203
Wait, so you've never
taken a boner pill?

48:28.205 --> 48:30.248
No, I've never
had to before now.

48:30.250 --> 48:31.425
Yeah, me neither.

48:32.513 --> 48:33.338
What do you think of it?

48:33.340 --> 48:34.600
Oh, I didn't take one.

48:34.602 --> 48:36.167
Why not?

48:36.169 --> 48:37.299
I don't need to.

48:37.301 --> 48:39.781
That's a bunch of
fake shit anyway.

48:40.565 --> 48:41.564
I like.

48:41.566 --> 48:42.869
Well, don't get used to it.

48:42.871 --> 48:44.567
It won't last long
and if it does,

48:44.569 --> 48:46.005
you're going to the ER.

48:50.357 --> 48:54.446
You don't need a man in
your life to be complete.

48:54.448 --> 48:59.277
You must first find peace and
completeness within yourself.

48:59.279 --> 49:02.456
Be the woman you
know you can be.

49:03.370 --> 49:06.371
Take that first step
and the remaining ones

49:06.373 --> 49:07.722
will fall into place.

49:08.941 --> 49:10.332
Now...

49:10.334 --> 49:13.596
Why do I hear be the
do, do the do in my head?

49:13.598 --> 49:15.467
Don't be so negative.

49:15.469 --> 49:17.904
She's come a long way and
she's helped a lot of women

49:17.906 --> 49:19.341
along the way.

49:19.343 --> 49:21.473
This is such bullshit.

49:21.475 --> 49:23.823
She's just trying
to sell her book.

49:23.825 --> 49:27.392
I need something real,
not commercial pop speak.

49:27.394 --> 49:28.306
Not enjoying the talk?

49:28.308 --> 49:30.003
It's such bullshit.

49:30.005 --> 49:32.223
She's so fake.

49:32.225 --> 49:34.921
She doesn't know what
I'm going through.

49:34.923 --> 49:36.836
They're nothing but sheep here.

49:36.838 --> 49:40.013
You have to read her story
to really understand her.

49:40.015 --> 49:42.146
Yeah, whatever.

49:42.148 --> 49:44.366
She really does
have a great story.

49:44.368 --> 49:45.715
She just doesn't talk about

49:45.717 --> 49:47.456
how she got her confidence
up in the beginning.

49:47.458 --> 49:49.068
See, I told you.

49:49.938 --> 49:50.720
Wait?

49:50.722 --> 49:52.330
How do you know that?

49:52.332 --> 49:54.376
'Cause she got her start
with me, at my school.

49:54.378 --> 49:56.249
And who are you?

49:57.511 --> 49:58.858
I'm Rhonda.

49:58.860 --> 50:00.860
I run A Lady's
Place here in town.

50:00.862 --> 50:02.819
What the hell is that?

50:02.821 --> 50:04.603
We teach women
how to have strength

50:04.605 --> 50:06.388
and power of their own

50:06.390 --> 50:09.739
and not get caught up in
a man's illusion of power.

50:09.741 --> 50:11.960
So you're selling a book, too?

50:13.179 --> 50:15.484
Come on, Ally, let's get
the hell out of here.

50:15.486 --> 50:17.442
Don't mind my friend,
she's just getting out of her

50:17.444 --> 50:19.401
second bad marriage.

50:19.403 --> 50:20.793
I don't mind.

50:20.795 --> 50:22.014
I know her type.

50:23.450 --> 50:26.451
Bitch just meets me and
thinks she knows my shit.

50:26.453 --> 50:27.539
Bitch.

50:27.541 --> 50:29.411
I know your shit 'cause I was

50:29.413 --> 50:32.109
in your shit not that long ago.

50:32.111 --> 50:35.547
Do you think you're the
only bitch with problems?

50:35.549 --> 50:36.376
Grow up.

50:38.726 --> 50:40.813
I like this lady.

50:40.815 --> 50:42.861
Okay, I'm listening.

50:43.688 --> 50:44.471
What you got?

50:47.039 --> 50:50.040
Come to our orientation
session tomorrow night.

50:50.042 --> 50:51.783
I promise you won't
be disappointed.

50:55.134 --> 50:56.394
Pay attention, Gina.

50:56.396 --> 50:58.744
No, I'm done here.

50:58.746 --> 51:00.398
Let's go, I'm getting hungry.

51:00.400 --> 51:01.965
That's it?

51:01.967 --> 51:03.532
It's not over.

51:03.534 --> 51:06.448
I'm gonna go to this place
and you're gonna come with me.

51:06.450 --> 51:07.492
Why?

51:07.494 --> 51:09.451
Because you
dragged my ass here,

51:09.453 --> 51:11.629
so I'm dragging your
ass with me tomorrow.

51:20.115 --> 51:21.506
What the hell are you wearing?

51:21.508 --> 51:23.989
Protection, from that girl.

51:24.903 --> 51:26.206
Mei?

51:26.208 --> 51:27.294
You?

51:27.296 --> 51:28.123
What?

51:29.342 --> 51:31.081
No, that, that girl.

51:31.083 --> 51:32.517
Yeah, Mei.

51:32.519 --> 51:33.605
No, not you.

51:33.607 --> 51:35.392
Don't be stupid, Jack.

51:36.218 --> 51:37.568
Her name is Mei.

51:38.612 --> 51:39.611
Oh.

51:39.613 --> 51:41.570
I thought her name was Heidi.

51:41.572 --> 51:43.223
Heidi?

51:43.225 --> 51:45.400
Does she look like a Heidi?

51:45.402 --> 51:46.575
No.

51:46.577 --> 51:49.186
You're one tough
guy, aren't you, Jack?

51:49.188 --> 51:50.753
She's tough as nails.

51:50.755 --> 51:52.496
I got the bruises to prove it.

51:53.453 --> 51:54.757
Why are you here?

51:54.759 --> 51:57.805
Why couldn't you deliver
the package yourself?

52:02.157 --> 52:03.594
I don't do deliveries.

52:23.614 --> 52:25.529
Thank you for
delivering my package.

52:27.618 --> 52:28.834
What the hell?

52:28.836 --> 52:29.881
See you next time.

52:32.623 --> 52:34.231
Yeah.

52:34.233 --> 52:35.060
I got it.

52:36.801 --> 52:38.148
Get this.

52:38.150 --> 52:39.717
Bruno showed up at the delivery.

52:41.458 --> 52:43.285
Yeah, I'm headed back now.

52:45.636 --> 52:46.463
Gotcha.

53:05.743 --> 53:07.046
What is it?

53:07.048 --> 53:08.526
Bruno's here to see you.

53:08.528 --> 53:11.224
Well, tell him
I'm busy, Jules.

53:11.226 --> 53:12.922
It's Julian.

53:12.924 --> 53:14.708
Now, Jules,

53:15.535 --> 53:17.622
why did I hire you?

53:17.624 --> 53:20.712
Because you fired the
last assistant you had.

53:20.714 --> 53:23.454
Exactly, because
Benji couldn't

53:23.456 --> 53:25.325
keep unwanted visitors out.

53:25.327 --> 53:26.370
Benjamin.

53:26.372 --> 53:27.373
Whatever.

53:28.156 --> 53:29.506
Go tell Bruno I'm busy.

53:48.263 --> 53:50.568
You're gonna need
a bigger assistant

53:50.570 --> 53:53.005
if you wanna keep me out.

53:53.007 --> 53:54.354
What do you want?

53:54.356 --> 53:56.576
Just to discuss our
upcoming school dance.

53:58.056 --> 53:59.272
Dance?

53:59.274 --> 54:00.752
What dance?

54:00.754 --> 54:02.624
Our
annual competition.

54:02.626 --> 54:04.669
It's not a dance.

54:04.671 --> 54:08.455
Well, I've told my students
it is, so just go with it.

54:08.457 --> 54:11.676
That is, unless you
don't have any students.

54:11.678 --> 54:13.809
I know business has been rough.

54:13.811 --> 54:15.769
Business is just fine.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.813
I've got a whole
crop of new recruits

54:17.815 --> 54:19.466
coming to orientation tonight.

54:19.468 --> 54:20.295
Good.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.601
You've got two
weeks to get ready.

54:23.603 --> 54:25.168
Two weeks?

54:25.170 --> 54:26.735
We don't start our first
session 'til tomorrow night.

54:26.737 --> 54:29.346
I can't possibly have
them ready in two weeks.

54:29.348 --> 54:30.695
Okay, then.

54:30.697 --> 54:32.436
If you want to forfeit.

54:32.438 --> 54:34.569
No, hell no, I don't.

54:34.571 --> 54:36.005
We'll be ready.

54:36.007 --> 54:36.834
Good.

54:39.358 --> 54:42.054
Why don't we raise
the stakes this year?

54:42.056 --> 54:43.969
What did you have in mind?

54:43.971 --> 54:45.580
Ownership rights.

54:45.582 --> 54:46.493
Of what?

54:46.495 --> 54:47.973
The business.

54:47.975 --> 54:51.629
I win, you close your
stupid macho academy.

54:52.589 --> 54:53.894
And when I win?

54:55.026 --> 54:56.416
I'll close A Lady's Place.

54:56.418 --> 54:57.679
Deal.

54:57.681 --> 54:59.291
That was too easy.

55:00.901 --> 55:02.509
Nope.

55:02.511 --> 55:04.165
I just know you're gonna lose.

55:12.609 --> 55:14.086
What's this?

55:14.088 --> 55:16.132
Your alimony check.

55:16.134 --> 55:18.745
I figured you might
need it a little early.

55:24.229 --> 55:25.056
Asshole.

55:26.144 --> 55:27.449
Jules, get in here.

55:32.672 --> 55:33.760
It's Julian.

55:34.718 --> 55:35.891
Whatever.

55:35.893 --> 55:36.720
Sit down.

55:46.425 --> 55:47.685
This is it?

55:47.687 --> 55:48.817
Where are all the
recruits, Jules?

55:48.819 --> 55:51.691
I'm sorry, it's
all I could round up.

55:52.692 --> 55:53.648
Okay.

55:53.650 --> 55:55.606
New tactic.

55:55.608 --> 55:58.609
I worked all day
on that speech.

55:58.611 --> 55:59.656
Well, it won't do now.

56:03.181 --> 56:05.398
Get ready to leave
in five minutes.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.270
I thought you wanted
to hear what she says.

56:07.272 --> 56:10.621
Yeah, she's got five
minutes to get my attention.

56:10.623 --> 56:14.801
You're all
pathetic, weak women.

56:16.760 --> 56:18.455
Losers.

56:18.457 --> 56:19.717
All of you.

56:19.719 --> 56:21.676
Let's go, I don't like
how this is starting.

56:21.678 --> 56:23.112
Wait.

56:23.114 --> 56:25.070
And that's what you've
been told your whole life.

56:25.072 --> 56:26.117
By men.

56:27.509 --> 56:28.552
Men.

56:28.554 --> 56:31.339
The supposedly stronger sex.

56:32.384 --> 56:35.692
Men who always get their ways.

56:37.215 --> 56:41.739
Men who make more money
doing the exact same thing

56:41.741 --> 56:42.611
that you do.

56:43.743 --> 56:46.091
They act like you're an equal

56:46.093 --> 56:48.835
but they want you to do
exactly what they say.

56:50.576 --> 56:52.447
What do you mean
you have a headache?

56:53.710 --> 56:57.539
Oh, wait, are you
on your period?

56:59.193 --> 57:02.804
Well, why else are you
dressed like that, huh?

57:02.806 --> 57:04.459
You want it, don't ya?

57:06.374 --> 57:09.767
You know, if a women
shows aggression

57:09.769 --> 57:12.422
and, God forbid, actually
wants to have sex,

57:12.424 --> 57:16.645
she's called a
whore, a slut, easy.

57:17.734 --> 57:19.472
But when a man
sleeps around, well,

57:19.474 --> 57:21.779
his buddies, they just put him

57:21.781 --> 57:24.521
on a pedestal and cheer him on.

57:24.523 --> 57:26.392
Does that make any sense?

57:26.394 --> 57:27.831
I mean, like, any, does it?

57:29.441 --> 57:31.615
I'm here to tell
you that you don't

57:31.617 --> 57:33.706
have to take that
bullshit any longer.

57:34.794 --> 57:37.577
You have the power
to change perception,

57:37.579 --> 57:39.884
be the woman that you've
always wanted to be,

57:39.886 --> 57:43.932
and take those men by the balls.

57:43.934 --> 57:47.109
And I don't mean figuratively.

57:47.111 --> 57:51.768
I mean grab those
dangling marbles

57:52.943 --> 57:55.813
and just squeeze tight

57:55.815 --> 57:57.423
and you know what?

57:57.425 --> 58:01.558
You'll have total control
over any man that you want.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.780
So if you're tired of being
taken advantage of by men,

58:05.782 --> 58:07.172
I can help you.

58:07.174 --> 58:08.826
Two weeks.

58:08.828 --> 58:12.789
That is all it will take to
completely change your life.

58:13.877 --> 58:15.008
Who's in?

58:16.357 --> 58:20.098
My assistant, Julian,
is at the table.

58:20.100 --> 58:22.187
He'll get you signed
up for our two-week,

58:22.189 --> 58:24.322
life-changing, crash course.

58:25.366 --> 58:26.583
Where are you going?

58:26.585 --> 58:28.846
To sign up and
you're coming with me.

58:28.848 --> 58:31.022
I don't want any part in this.

58:31.024 --> 58:33.851
You get pushed around
by men all the time.

58:33.853 --> 58:36.114
You need this just
as much as I do.

58:36.116 --> 58:37.855
I do?

58:37.857 --> 58:39.335
Yeah.

58:39.337 --> 58:40.771
And I don't have any money.

58:40.773 --> 58:42.947
I'll pay you back, I promise.

58:42.949 --> 58:44.079
Gina!

58:44.081 --> 58:47.388
Ally, come on,
please, I need this.

58:48.650 --> 58:49.954
Did you just say please?

58:49.956 --> 58:52.350
Don't be a bitch, yes, please.

58:54.352 --> 58:57.266
It is worth it just to
hear you say those words.

58:57.268 --> 58:58.791
Awesome, let's go.

59:04.579 --> 59:07.060
Oh, Jack, your favorite
customer just walked in.

59:13.937 --> 59:16.067
Welcome, breakfast for one?

59:16.069 --> 59:18.461
Do you see anybody
else with me?

59:18.463 --> 59:20.855
Well, no, but last
time you were here...

59:20.857 --> 59:22.859
Just get me a coffee to go.

59:23.860 --> 59:25.772
- Okay.
- Can you handle that?

59:25.774 --> 59:27.035
Yes.

59:27.037 --> 59:28.473
I'll be right back.

59:35.001 --> 59:37.001
I see you two are
getting along quite well.

59:37.003 --> 59:39.134
She is such a bitch.

59:39.136 --> 59:40.439
I don't know what
crawled up her ass

59:40.441 --> 59:42.311
so early this morning.

59:42.313 --> 59:43.921
So why don't you
take the high road?

59:43.923 --> 59:45.227
How?

59:45.229 --> 59:46.750
Don't charge her
for the coffee.

59:46.752 --> 59:48.012
On the house.

59:48.014 --> 59:49.535
Okay, I don't see
how that's gonna help.

59:49.537 --> 59:50.364
Trust me.

59:54.020 --> 59:56.499
Hi, how may I help you?

59:56.501 --> 59:58.109
On the house.

59:58.111 --> 59:59.458
Why?

59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.461
Well, last time
you were in here,

01:00:02.463 --> 01:00:05.551
you know, the serving skills
weren't up to par, so.

01:00:05.553 --> 01:00:06.857
Aha.

01:00:06.859 --> 01:00:08.076
And you look like
you could use it, too.

01:00:08.078 --> 01:00:09.904
What's that supposed to mean?

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:12.428
Nothing, I mean, you just
look a little stressed.

01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:14.082
Stressed?

01:00:14.084 --> 01:00:14.909
Really?

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.084
No.

01:00:16.086 --> 01:00:18.869
Nothing, sorry, just
trying to be nice.

01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:21.959
Well, you need to work
on your social skills.

01:00:21.961 --> 01:00:23.876
Believe me, I am.

01:00:25.008 --> 01:00:27.010
Thanks for coming
in, have a nice day.

01:00:28.968 --> 01:00:32.929
Look, I'll give you
a pass this time, if.

01:00:33.712 --> 01:00:34.972
If?

01:00:34.974 --> 01:00:37.148
If you tell me where
I can get this music

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:38.804
you guys are playing in here.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.022
Oh, you can't.

01:00:41.024 --> 01:00:43.763
You're not scoring
any points, dude.

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:45.940
No, I mean you can't
because it's not for sale.

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:46.986
It's my music.

01:00:48.205 --> 01:00:48.988
Your music?

01:00:49.989 --> 01:00:51.989
Yeah, I'm in a band.

01:00:51.991 --> 01:00:53.948
Well, I was in a band.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.864
I'm not anymore, but I
still love to compose music.

01:00:57.866 --> 01:01:00.128
This is your music?

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:01.477
Yes.

01:01:01.479 --> 01:01:02.782
Cool.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:03.568
Very cool.

01:01:04.699 --> 01:01:06.047
Thanks.

01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:08.658
I can bring you a copy
next time you come in.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.966
That'd be great.

01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.533
Great, my pleasure.

01:01:26.112 --> 01:01:29.374
Hey, you need to work on
your communication skills.

01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:31.333
I know, I know.

01:01:31.335 --> 01:01:33.117
Nice save with
the music though.

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:34.858
Yeah.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.209
I didn't see that coming.

01:01:39.082 --> 01:01:40.168
Men.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:42.126
We're going to shift
into high gear.

01:01:42.128 --> 01:01:45.825
In two weeks, you will
meet the competition.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:49.916
Each of you will go head
to head with a woman

01:01:49.918 --> 01:01:51.179
from A Lady's Place.

01:01:51.181 --> 01:01:54.834
Uh, what's A Lady's Place?

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:56.358
Good question.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.754
It's a place where women learn
to take advantage of men.

01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:04.627
These women are the
reason men get divorced.

01:02:04.629 --> 01:02:07.369
They give all men a bad name.

01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:10.198
What are we
gonna do, beat 'em?

01:02:11.505 --> 01:02:13.418
Don't be an ass.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.942
We don't condone violence here.

01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:17.205
I'm kidding.

01:02:17.207 --> 01:02:19.076
What do you mean by competition?

01:02:19.078 --> 01:02:20.338
What's even the point?

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.732
The point is to
show these women

01:02:22.734 --> 01:02:24.777
how a real man does things.

01:02:24.779 --> 01:02:27.258
You will be tasked with
getting a date with a woman.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.999
How are we gonna do that?

01:02:29.001 --> 01:02:31.175
I'm glad you asked, Jack.

01:02:31.177 --> 01:02:33.875
The next series of workshops
will teach you just that.

01:02:34.746 --> 01:02:36.224
Chris.

01:02:36.226 --> 01:02:38.228
Well, I guess that leaves
me out of the competition.

01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:40.271
Why?

01:02:40.273 --> 01:02:41.751
Because I'm not into women.

01:02:41.753 --> 01:02:43.059
Yeah, I know.

01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:47.150
You've got to get a man.

01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:49.237
I can do that.

01:02:49.239 --> 01:02:50.283
Anymore questions?

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:54.244
Put your big boy
britches on, men.

01:02:55.158 --> 01:02:56.420
And get ready to work.

01:03:01.512 --> 01:03:04.165
It looks like a
good group of ladies.

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:05.949
Well, I'm not
looking for good.

01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:08.473
I need women with
killer instincts.

01:03:08.475 --> 01:03:10.823
Those Mister Academy men
aren't good ol' boys.

01:03:10.825 --> 01:03:13.130
Are you girls excited or what?

01:03:13.132 --> 01:03:15.089
I'm ready to tear
apart some men.

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.829
Excuse me?

01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:18.396
There'll be no
tearing apart here.

01:03:18.398 --> 01:03:20.877
You haven't read
Rhonda's blogs, have you?

01:03:20.879 --> 01:03:22.185
No, I haven't.

01:03:23.577 --> 01:03:24.576
What do they say?

01:03:24.578 --> 01:03:26.665
She's a man killer.

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:28.885
Ever since her divorce,
she's dedicated her life

01:03:28.887 --> 01:03:31.977
to make sure women don't get
taken advantage of by men.

01:03:33.152 --> 01:03:35.674
Well, I don't think you
have to be mean to have that.

01:03:35.676 --> 01:03:37.763
You haven't had a
boyfriend lately, huh?

01:03:37.765 --> 01:03:39.852
No, she hasn't.

01:03:39.854 --> 01:03:40.853
I'm Gina.

01:03:40.855 --> 01:03:41.985
This is Ally.

01:03:41.987 --> 01:03:43.423
Maya, nice to meet you.

01:03:44.381 --> 01:03:45.945
Welcome, ladies.

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:48.861
I'm very excited that you've
all decided to join in

01:03:48.863 --> 01:03:51.255
on this life-changing adventure.

01:03:51.257 --> 01:03:53.692
I'm Julian, Rhonda's assistant.

01:03:53.694 --> 01:03:56.608
I have the privilege
of introducing to you

01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:00.569
the one woman who will make
all of your dreams come true.

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:03.920
Rhonda Marie Moretti.

01:04:06.881 --> 01:04:07.882
Thank you, Julian.

01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:09.752
Ladies.

01:04:09.754 --> 01:04:10.624
Welcome.

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:14.585
You're all here because
you're ready for a change.

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:19.022
So I'm not gonna bullshit
you with a long speech.

01:04:19.024 --> 01:04:21.503
Because now's not the time
for bullshit speeches.

01:04:21.505 --> 01:04:23.115
It's the time for action.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:28.338
These next two weeks,
they're all about action.

01:04:29.208 --> 01:04:32.166
You're gonna learn
how to handle,

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:37.173
subdue, acquire, and
take control of a man.

01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:40.261
Yes, whoo!

01:04:40.263 --> 01:04:41.914
Whoo, yes!

01:04:41.916 --> 01:04:43.960
There you go, yeah, baby!

01:04:43.962 --> 01:04:48.878
That, that, that
right there, ladies,

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.227
is what you're all gonna need,

01:04:50.229 --> 01:04:52.577
that enthusiasm, that gusto.

01:04:52.579 --> 01:04:54.666
You're gonna need it to succeed.

01:04:54.668 --> 01:04:57.930
We're not the weaker sex.

01:04:57.932 --> 01:05:00.803
We are the stronger one.

01:05:00.805 --> 01:05:03.109
By the end of these two weeks,

01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:05.764
you'll learn just how
to become that woman.

01:05:05.766 --> 01:05:08.463
I think Maya needs to
lay off the caffeine.

01:05:08.465 --> 01:05:10.639
I don't think this is
the place for me, Gina.

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:12.293
Rhonda sounds angry.

01:05:12.295 --> 01:05:14.120
Well, I don't blame her.

01:05:14.122 --> 01:05:16.079
She should sound angry.

01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:17.385
Men suck.

01:05:17.387 --> 01:05:19.650
Come see Julian for
your class schedules.

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:26.045
Recognizing a Loser.

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.700
I needed that before my
first and second marriage.

01:05:28.702 --> 01:05:31.399
How to Keep Your Man Hard?

01:05:31.401 --> 01:05:33.749
I needed that
before my last date.

01:05:33.751 --> 01:05:35.927
Mr. Softie was such a loser.

01:05:37.972 --> 01:05:42.281
Oh, How to Take Control
and Keep Your Legs Closed.

01:05:43.413 --> 01:05:45.893
I got a bad feeling
about all of this.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.024
What's going on, boss?

01:05:48.026 --> 01:05:50.246
Why the emergency meeting?

01:05:51.812 --> 01:05:53.725
I just wanted you guys
to know what's at stakes

01:05:53.727 --> 01:05:56.293
with A Lady's Place competition.

01:05:56.295 --> 01:05:58.556
What do you mean, it's
not the same as last year?

01:05:58.558 --> 01:05:59.905
No.

01:05:59.907 --> 01:06:02.604
Rhonda has raised
the stakes higher.

01:06:02.606 --> 01:06:03.822
How high?

01:06:03.824 --> 01:06:07.478
If we lose, we
close Mister Academy.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.392
What the hell?

01:06:08.394 --> 01:06:10.002
Bruno, are you crazy, man?

01:06:10.004 --> 01:06:11.743
No, just confident.

01:06:11.745 --> 01:06:14.398
You have not seen these
guys, these guys are pathetic.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.879
Yeah, what a bunch of losers.

01:06:16.881 --> 01:06:18.315
Step it up, guys.

01:06:18.317 --> 01:06:21.364
We ain't losin', and I'm
not closing this place down.

01:06:22.887 --> 01:06:24.365
Now.

01:06:24.367 --> 01:06:26.238
What's Tino teaching 'em today?

01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:28.022
Proper grooming.

01:06:30.373 --> 01:06:32.373
I thought we weren't
gonna teach them that?

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:35.289
You guys remember what
happened to the guy last time.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:38.335
Yeah, but he didn't lose
any of his family Jules.

01:06:38.337 --> 01:06:41.338
He just can't feel one anymore.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:45.039
Jeez, Vinny, call the medic
and have him on standby.

01:06:51.916 --> 01:06:56.703
Now, remember, gentlemen,
the tree always appears taller

01:06:58.096 --> 01:07:00.446
when the bushes are trimmed.

01:07:01.229 --> 01:07:02.359
That's right.

01:07:02.361 --> 01:07:06.713
A woman appreciates
a well-groomed man.

01:07:08.193 --> 01:07:10.715
Excuse me, uh, I think
I'm gonna skip this lesson.

01:07:10.717 --> 01:07:13.414
Oh, don't be scared,
little buckaroo.

01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:14.980
Oh, I'm not scared.

01:07:14.982 --> 01:07:16.504
Then what's the problem?

01:07:16.506 --> 01:07:18.812
Come on, Chris, if I'm
doing this, so are you.

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.949
I just got my monthly waxing.

01:07:26.951 --> 01:07:28.298
Damn.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.256
Smoother than a
newborn's bottom.

01:07:30.258 --> 01:07:31.085
Thank you.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:36.219
Okay, you are excused
from this exercise.

01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:38.482
And write down the
name of your waxer.

01:07:38.484 --> 01:07:40.312
I'm looking for somebody new.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.705
Everybody else,
gather your materials

01:07:43.707 --> 01:07:47.404
and please proceed to your
stalls in the next room.

01:07:47.406 --> 01:07:51.539
And remember, gentlemen,
this is not a race.

01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:53.497
Take your time.

01:07:53.499 --> 01:07:55.806
Be careful.

01:07:57.416 --> 01:07:59.329
Please don't
open your bags yet,

01:07:59.331 --> 01:08:02.203
Rhonda will explain
what to do, thank you.

01:08:05.642 --> 01:08:10.471
Please don't open the bag yet.

01:08:10.473 --> 01:08:11.343
Thank you.

01:08:16.435 --> 01:08:19.872
Gina, put the bag down
before you break what's inside.

01:08:21.048 --> 01:08:22.613
You worry too much, girl.

01:08:22.615 --> 01:08:24.746
Ladies, your
attention, please.

01:08:24.747 --> 01:08:25.703
I'm so excited.

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.054
We'll get to what's in your
goodie bags in just a minute.

01:08:29.055 --> 01:08:30.533
Pay attention, Gina.

01:08:30.536 --> 01:08:32.014
Yes, mother.

01:08:32.015 --> 01:08:34.973
What is one reason why
you failed at getting a man?

01:08:34.975 --> 01:08:36.540
Oh, oh, I know.

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:37.759
Okay.

01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:39.674
Because I picked a
big old douchebag, yeah.

01:08:41.024 --> 01:08:44.330
Yes, yes, that is
probably one reason.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:45.203
Anybody else?

01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:48.595
I let my girlfriends
pick my dates.

01:08:48.598 --> 01:08:52.904
Yes, yes, yes, the
inevitable blind date.

01:08:52.906 --> 01:08:56.647
Uh, I didn't have
a plan of attack.

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:58.564
Yes, yes, yes, that's it.

01:08:59.564 --> 01:09:00.434
What's your name?

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:01.346
Maya.

01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:02.392
You've been reading my blog?

01:09:02.394 --> 01:09:03.393
Yes.

01:09:03.395 --> 01:09:05.439
I read them every week.

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.572
You are amazing, I love you.

01:09:08.573 --> 01:09:10.182
Suck up.

01:09:10.184 --> 01:09:14.448
When was the last time
that you went on vacation

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.452
and you didn't have a plan?

01:09:17.975 --> 01:09:19.365
Do you just, I don't know,
get up in the mornings,

01:09:19.367 --> 01:09:21.411
walk out the door and not know

01:09:21.412 --> 01:09:22.673
what you're going to
do during the day?

01:09:22.675 --> 01:09:25.023
Yeah, like every day.

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:26.502
Gina, right?

01:09:26.505 --> 01:09:27.939
Yeah, good memory.

01:09:27.941 --> 01:09:30.812
How do those days
normally turn out for you?

01:09:30.814 --> 01:09:32.161
Be honest.

01:09:32.162 --> 01:09:33.510
Pretty shitty, actually.

01:09:33.511 --> 01:09:35.077
Exactly.

01:09:35.078 --> 01:09:37.600
And that is how your
date will turn out

01:09:37.603 --> 01:09:39.692
if you don't have
a plan of attack.

01:09:40.563 --> 01:09:42.475
The goodie bags in front of you,

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:45.304
they're part of
your attack plan.

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:48.524
So go ahead and look
inside, pull out each item,

01:09:48.527 --> 01:09:50.310
lay it on the table
in front of you.

01:09:54.533 --> 01:09:56.228
Oh, this is nice.

01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:58.624
Uh, that's not for your hands.

01:10:00.365 --> 01:10:01.148
Oh.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:04.672
Um, what are the
white pills for?

01:10:04.674 --> 01:10:06.369
Oh, yes, yes.

01:10:06.371 --> 01:10:09.503
That is my favorite
item in the bag.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:13.550
This, ladies, this is
your most powerful weapon

01:10:13.552 --> 01:10:14.771
to gain control of a man.

01:10:15.859 --> 01:10:17.598
The boner pill.

01:10:18.992 --> 01:10:22.080
Excuse me, these really
are to help the guy,

01:10:22.082 --> 01:10:23.386
so how does it help me?

01:10:23.388 --> 01:10:25.431
That's, that's true.

01:10:25.433 --> 01:10:27.651
Just not how I would use them.

01:10:27.653 --> 01:10:28.957
Have you ever been with a man

01:10:28.959 --> 01:10:30.524
who's had trouble
getting an erection?

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:32.482
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10:32.484 --> 01:10:35.790
The key to control is to
just take one of these babies

01:10:35.792 --> 01:10:37.966
and just slip it into
your date's drink.

01:10:37.968 --> 01:10:40.359
But why would I
want to do that?

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:43.145
Because there's
nothing more controlling

01:10:43.147 --> 01:10:46.844
than an unsatisfied, hard dick.

01:10:49.327 --> 01:10:51.501
Yeah, he gets hard.

01:10:51.503 --> 01:10:52.460
You know it.

01:10:53.853 --> 01:10:57.681
You tease him and then you
leave him, unsatisfied.

01:10:59.816 --> 01:11:02.512
That is just not very nice.

01:11:02.514 --> 01:11:05.384
Well, this is not
about being nice.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:08.128
This about taking
control of the situation.

01:11:10.478 --> 01:11:11.695
Okay.

01:11:11.697 --> 01:11:12.959
Let's talk about
the handcuffs next.

01:11:15.092 --> 01:11:16.702
Okay, gentlemen.

01:11:18.486 --> 01:11:20.878
Inspection time.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.187
Get ready to drop your shorts.

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:27.017
And.

01:11:29.541 --> 01:11:30.368
Mm-hm.

01:11:33.197 --> 01:11:34.024
Hmm.

01:11:37.114 --> 01:11:37.941
Hm, nice.

01:11:40.117 --> 01:11:40.944
Ooh.

01:11:42.685 --> 01:11:44.208
Is something wrong?

01:11:46.384 --> 01:11:47.211
No.

01:11:48.647 --> 01:11:50.299
Nicely done.

01:11:50.301 --> 01:11:53.783
Just make sure you get lots
of aloe down there tonight.

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.785
Why?

01:11:56.873 --> 01:11:59.049
Trust me, don't forget.

01:12:02.879 --> 01:12:03.662
Mm-hm.

01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:06.273
Mm.

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:08.885
Okay.

01:12:10.364 --> 01:12:13.539
Oh, and that goes for everyone
else as well, gentlemen.

01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:17.239
Aloe vera, your best friend.

01:12:17.241 --> 01:12:20.372
Okay, nice job, everyone.

01:12:20.374 --> 01:12:21.635
That's it for tonight.

01:12:21.637 --> 01:12:25.508
Tomorrow, we will
work on pick up lines.

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:27.077
Thank you, goodnight.

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:39.740
That is some razor burn, dude.

01:12:39.742 --> 01:12:41.567
That's why I get waxed.

01:12:41.569 --> 01:12:43.528
Doesn't feel like razor burn.

01:12:45.269 --> 01:12:47.661
Ouch, that is a little tender.

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:50.100
Yeah, aloe, lots
and lots of aloe.

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:02.110
Evening, ladies.

01:13:02.112 --> 01:13:03.679
What can I get for you today?

01:13:04.767 --> 01:13:05.591
Are you okay, Jack?

01:13:05.593 --> 01:13:06.941
Oh, I'm fine.

01:13:06.943 --> 01:13:08.551
Why?

01:13:08.553 --> 01:13:09.900
You're walking like
you've got a bowling ball

01:13:09.902 --> 01:13:11.685
between your legs.

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:14.818
Just sunburn, forgot the aloe.

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:16.733
Coffee?

01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:18.517
Uh, yes, please.

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:19.651
Yes, and water.

01:13:22.393 --> 01:13:24.872
I brought you that
CD I promised you.

01:13:24.874 --> 01:13:26.702
I hope you like it.

01:13:27.746 --> 01:13:28.963
Thanks, Jack.

01:13:28.965 --> 01:13:29.792
My pleasure.

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:33.707
So, Laura's gonna be
taking over for me.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.058
I gotta get to my second job.

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:45.240
That was very nice of Jack.

01:13:45.242 --> 01:13:46.722
Jack's pretty cool.

01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:48.767
Pretty cool?

01:13:49.768 --> 01:13:51.899
You like him, don't you?

01:13:51.901 --> 01:13:54.379
Quit it, I'm just
being nice to him.

01:13:54.381 --> 01:13:56.860
No, the last guy you
were nice to, you married.

01:13:56.862 --> 01:14:00.385
Look, I'm learning
not to be fooled by men.

01:14:00.387 --> 01:14:02.779
Some guys are just nice.

01:14:02.781 --> 01:14:04.825
Don't let your last two
ex-husbands convince you

01:14:04.827 --> 01:14:06.002
that all guys are bad.

01:14:08.395 --> 01:14:09.873
What are you doing?

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:12.267
Studying for tonight's test.

01:14:12.269 --> 01:14:15.139
Worst pick-up lines
review and test.

01:14:15.141 --> 01:14:17.533
You're taking Rhonda's
message seriously?

01:14:17.535 --> 01:14:19.883
She's got her shit together.

01:14:19.885 --> 01:14:21.363
Don't you think?

01:14:21.365 --> 01:14:23.802
No, I think she's
a bitter woman.

01:14:26.979 --> 01:14:28.067
Excuse me, miss.

01:14:28.938 --> 01:14:30.415
Yeah?

01:14:30.417 --> 01:14:32.809
Are you related
to my keyboard?

01:14:32.811 --> 01:14:34.376
No, why?

01:14:34.378 --> 01:14:36.117
Because you're just my type.

01:14:36.119 --> 01:14:37.947
Get the hell out of here.

01:14:51.961 --> 01:14:52.788
What's that?

01:14:57.923 --> 01:14:59.011
For you.

01:15:18.117 --> 01:15:18.944
Wow.

01:15:20.511 --> 01:15:24.339
Thank you.

01:15:24.341 --> 01:15:25.168
You're welcome.

01:15:32.001 --> 01:15:32.828
Hey.

01:15:33.959 --> 01:15:35.961
A whole ten dollars, huh?

01:15:43.882 --> 01:15:45.490
Can I help you?

01:15:45.492 --> 01:15:47.059
You get some good pictures?

01:15:48.104 --> 01:15:49.668
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:50.887
Yeah, you see, I
got a good friend

01:15:50.889 --> 01:15:52.497
that likes to take
pictures, too.

01:15:52.499 --> 01:15:55.152
And he's real good at
getting just the right angle.

01:15:55.154 --> 01:15:55.938
Yeah, here.

01:15:57.504 --> 01:15:58.331
Take a look.

01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:02.594
Mm?

01:16:02.596 --> 01:16:03.769
You know, I think
your wife would love

01:16:03.771 --> 01:16:04.990
to see these
pictures, don't you?

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:07.384
What do you want?

01:16:08.341 --> 01:16:09.168
Nothing.

01:16:10.996 --> 01:16:11.952
Should I send her a copy?

01:16:11.954 --> 01:16:13.605
No.

01:16:13.607 --> 01:16:15.738
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.218
I don't expect to see
you around here again,

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.349
you understand me?

01:16:18.351 --> 01:16:20.917
Yeah, I do.

01:16:20.919 --> 01:16:22.007
Good.

01:16:23.226 --> 01:16:24.792
Now get the hell outta here.

01:16:29.536 --> 01:16:31.928
I'm so proud of all of you.

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:35.192
You've worked really hard
over the last two weeks.

01:16:35.194 --> 01:16:38.587
Tomorrow night, you get
to meet your competition.

01:16:38.589 --> 01:16:40.502
You get to take
what you've learned

01:16:40.504 --> 01:16:42.027
and put it into practice.

01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:44.767
So who's ready to
go into battle?

01:16:45.988 --> 01:16:46.858
Battle?

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:48.902
Bring it on!

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:50.688
I'm ready to get this shit on!

01:16:52.951 --> 01:16:54.516
Yes, you've got it!

01:16:54.518 --> 01:16:58.174
Men, I have heard you are
the best group we've ever had.

01:17:00.959 --> 01:17:04.047
You're gonna need to be
to beat the ruthlessness

01:17:04.049 --> 01:17:06.180
of the women from
the Lady's Place.

01:17:06.182 --> 01:17:08.793
They will not play by the rules.

01:17:09.968 --> 01:17:12.928
They will go straight
for your balls to win.

01:17:14.799 --> 01:17:16.842
Believe me, I know them.

01:17:16.844 --> 01:17:21.153
They will not stop until they
have beaten us to a pulp.

01:17:22.589 --> 01:17:26.113
Tomorrow night, these
ladies will join us,

01:17:26.115 --> 01:17:29.551
so, men, get a good night's rest

01:17:29.553 --> 01:17:33.120
and get ready to kick
some lovely asses.

01:17:51.749 --> 01:17:53.096
Hey, buddy, can
I get you a beer?

01:17:53.098 --> 01:17:55.971
No, I want to be sharp
for tomorrow night.

01:17:58.147 --> 01:17:59.755
About that.

01:17:59.757 --> 01:18:02.018
Are you sure you still want
to go through with this?

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.324
Are you shitting me?

01:18:03.326 --> 01:18:04.978
Yes.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.588
But you don't even
know what they want you to do.

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:09.373
I figure we'll practice what
we learned with these women.

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:10.679
I don't know.

01:18:10.681 --> 01:18:12.986
We've learned some
pretty stupid shit.

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:14.378
Stupid?

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.775
How to talk to a
woman is not stupid.

01:18:19.951 --> 01:18:22.171
I'm finally getting
used to these razors.

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:27.130
Did you know they make
ball-sized band-aids?

01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:29.132
Yeah, I know.

01:18:29.134 --> 01:18:32.092
Hey, I just didn't want you to
be disappointed, that's all.

01:18:32.094 --> 01:18:33.223
Dude, you're the
one who told me

01:18:33.225 --> 01:18:35.051
I didn't know how
to treat a woman.

01:18:35.053 --> 01:18:38.533
How will I ever get Sheila
back if I don't learn how to?

01:18:38.535 --> 01:18:41.188
Is that what you think
you've been learning?

01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:42.276
Look.

01:18:42.278 --> 01:18:43.712
You and Sheila, you
just grew apart.

01:18:43.714 --> 01:18:45.018
It happens.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.194
I didn't know
how to treat her.

01:18:47.196 --> 01:18:50.414
I didn't know what it was
like to be a good husband.

01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:52.068
Why are you messing with me?

01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:54.157
I'm finally getting
my life together.

01:18:54.159 --> 01:18:55.030
I'm sorry.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.378
You've been working really hard.

01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.296
I even saved up enough
money to get my own place.

01:19:04.082 --> 01:19:08.084
Really, that's,
that's great, I guess.

01:19:08.086 --> 01:19:10.739
I thought you'd be
happy to get rid of me.

01:19:10.741 --> 01:19:12.262
Nah, man, to be honest,

01:19:12.264 --> 01:19:14.136
I kinda got used to
you being around.

01:19:15.615 --> 01:19:17.789
You're a different man than
when you first moved in with me.

01:19:17.791 --> 01:19:19.095
See?

01:19:19.097 --> 01:19:20.096
It's all because
of Mister Academy.

01:19:20.098 --> 01:19:21.924
Okay, okay.

01:19:21.926 --> 01:19:23.404
Look, I'm going to bed.

01:19:23.406 --> 01:19:24.233
Night, Jackie.

01:19:25.451 --> 01:19:26.278
Night, buddy.

01:19:37.594 --> 01:19:39.115
What are they doing here?

01:19:39.117 --> 01:19:40.247
Who?

01:19:40.249 --> 01:19:42.118
Gina and Ally.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.250
You know them?

01:19:43.252 --> 01:19:44.468
They're regulars
at the restaurant.

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:46.253
I told you about Gina.

01:19:46.255 --> 01:19:48.124
Oh, that bitch customer.

01:19:48.126 --> 01:19:50.213
She's not a bitch,
really, it's just,

01:19:50.215 --> 01:19:52.172
she's tough on the outside.

01:19:52.174 --> 01:19:53.608
So you like her?

01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:54.739
No.

01:19:54.741 --> 01:19:55.568
No?

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.091
Well, she's nice.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:20:00.093
But I don't like her.

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:02.749
Oh, so you like her but
you don't really like her.

01:20:04.055 --> 01:20:05.272
Exactly.

01:20:05.274 --> 01:20:06.099
Okay.

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:07.276
Whatever you say, man.

01:20:08.755 --> 01:20:09.887
I'll be right back.

01:20:21.203 --> 01:20:23.203
Ladies,
ladies, ladies.

01:20:23.205 --> 01:20:24.247
Jack?

01:20:24.249 --> 01:20:25.118
Gina.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.207
What are you doing here?

01:20:27.209 --> 01:20:29.470
I could ask you
the same thing.

01:20:29.472 --> 01:20:32.255
Wait, are you a student
at the Lady's Place?

01:20:32.257 --> 01:20:33.169
Yeah.

01:20:33.171 --> 01:20:34.562
Wait.

01:20:34.564 --> 01:20:37.173
Do you go to that male
chauvinist Mister Academy?

01:20:37.175 --> 01:20:38.566
Male chauvinist?

01:20:38.568 --> 01:20:40.350
Yeah, that's what Rhonda said.

01:20:40.352 --> 01:20:41.743
Who the hell is Rhonda?

01:20:41.745 --> 01:20:42.833
My teacher.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:46.226
Yeah, well, well, Bruno says

01:20:46.228 --> 01:20:48.663
you guys are just a bunch
of ball-busting bitches.

01:20:48.665 --> 01:20:50.186
Ball-busting?

01:20:50.188 --> 01:20:52.319
And I thought you
were a nice guy.

01:20:52.321 --> 01:20:55.846
Yeah, well, obviously I
know who you really are.

01:20:59.197 --> 01:21:01.023
I was really starting
to like that guy.

01:21:01.025 --> 01:21:02.242
And now you don't?

01:21:02.244 --> 01:21:04.679
He goes to Mister Academy.

01:21:04.681 --> 01:21:07.247
He was probably just
using me for some project.

01:21:07.249 --> 01:21:08.857
Gina, you
don't know that.

01:21:08.859 --> 01:21:11.164
My instincts are spot on.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:13.340
Says the twice divorced woman.

01:21:13.342 --> 01:21:14.212
Shut it.

01:21:19.217 --> 01:21:20.349
Well, how'd that go?

01:21:21.393 --> 01:21:23.741
I don't want to talk about it.

01:21:23.743 --> 01:21:25.090
Bitch.

01:21:25.092 --> 01:21:26.483
I thought you said
she wasn't a bitch.

01:21:26.485 --> 01:21:27.310
Well, I was wrong.

01:21:27.312 --> 01:21:28.835
Okay, flipper.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.662
Wait.

01:21:31.664 --> 01:21:33.229
Who's that beauty?

01:21:33.231 --> 01:21:34.491
Who are you looking at?

01:21:34.493 --> 01:21:36.145
That guy right there.

01:21:36.147 --> 01:21:38.843
I'm in crisis mode and
you're scoping out a dude?

01:21:38.845 --> 01:21:41.890
Look, I'm just trying to put
what I learned to good use.

01:21:41.892 --> 01:21:42.719
Excuse me.

01:21:52.816 --> 01:21:55.208
Hey, you look like you've
been working really hard.

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.774
Here you go.

01:21:56.776 --> 01:21:58.254
Thanks.

01:21:58.256 --> 01:21:59.301
Yeah, my name's Chris.

01:22:00.258 --> 01:22:01.301
Jules.

01:22:01.303 --> 01:22:02.998
Ugh, Julian.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.653
Damn it, Rhonda's got
me saying it, too.

01:22:05.655 --> 01:22:06.871
What, Jules?

01:22:06.873 --> 01:22:08.351
I mean, I like
that, it suits you.

01:22:08.353 --> 01:22:09.702
I mean, you do sparkle.

01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:11.748
Thank you.

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:14.314
So you're the,

01:22:14.316 --> 01:22:15.793
you're the main guy
in charge, right?

01:22:15.795 --> 01:22:17.708
Oh, no, no, no, god, no.

01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:19.275
I'm just the assistant.

01:22:19.277 --> 01:22:20.929
Oh, well, the way you've
been working this room

01:22:20.931 --> 01:22:23.238
I just figured that
you were the main man.

01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:25.238
It was nice talking to you.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.283
Uh, you too.

01:22:27.285 --> 01:22:28.330
Thanks.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:32.375
You get his number?

01:22:32.377 --> 01:22:35.378
Nope, just laying the
ground work, my friend.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.252
Just laying the ground work.

01:22:38.644 --> 01:22:39.643
Rhonda.

01:22:39.645 --> 01:22:40.472
Bruno.

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.387
How do you want to do this?

01:22:44.389 --> 01:22:45.736
Same as always.

01:22:45.738 --> 01:22:48.043
Just spare me the
motivational speech.

01:22:48.045 --> 01:22:49.523
My guys love it.

01:22:49.525 --> 01:22:50.352
Doubtful.

01:22:51.962 --> 01:22:54.441
Ladies, guys, we're
about to get started,

01:22:54.443 --> 01:22:56.401
so, please find your
way to your seats.

01:22:57.576 --> 01:23:01.274
Welcome to our annual
school competition.

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:04.929
This is our fifth year running
our friendly competition.

01:23:04.931 --> 01:23:06.366
Yes.

01:23:06.368 --> 01:23:08.324
And this is a very
important year.

01:23:08.326 --> 01:23:09.675
The tie-breaking year.

01:23:11.503 --> 01:23:13.634
For your assignments,

01:23:13.636 --> 01:23:17.202
you'll each be paired up with
someone from the other school.

01:23:17.204 --> 01:23:20.075
Time to take what you've
learned, put it into practice.

01:23:20.077 --> 01:23:23.298
The goal is to get a date with
someone that you don't know.

01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:25.733
Simple, right?

01:23:25.735 --> 01:23:27.389
School with the most dates wins.

01:23:28.781 --> 01:23:32.783
There's no limit,
the number of dates.

01:23:32.785 --> 01:23:36.352
However, each date has to
be with a different person.

01:23:36.354 --> 01:23:38.311
It's not about quality.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.964
It's about quantity.

01:23:39.966 --> 01:23:40.837
Besides,

01:23:42.186 --> 01:23:44.447
you won't find much
quality out there.

01:23:46.364 --> 01:23:47.581
Boo.

01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:50.888
You know, Bruno's
right, ladies.

01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:53.891
There aren't many
quality men out there.

01:23:57.375 --> 01:23:59.288
Please see Julian and Tino.

01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:01.336
They'll let you know who
you've been paired up with.

01:24:10.475 --> 01:24:11.822
You're so going down.

01:24:11.824 --> 01:24:13.607
You're going down, bitch.

01:24:13.609 --> 01:24:15.435
Is that how it's gonna be?

01:24:15.437 --> 01:24:18.178
- You fuck...
- No need to get foul-mouthed.

01:24:18.962 --> 01:24:20.485
It's not gonna help you win.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:23.009
Go on.

01:24:24.968 --> 01:24:25.795
Good luck.

01:24:28.014 --> 01:24:29.362
It looks
like we're out of names.

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:30.972
No, wait a minute,
that's not right.

01:24:30.974 --> 01:24:33.496
We, I thought we had
enough for everyone to be

01:24:33.498 --> 01:24:34.758
evenly paired up.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.456
We're out.

01:24:36.458 --> 01:24:38.460
Well, how about I
pair up with Jules?

01:24:39.852 --> 01:24:41.591
That's not appropriate.

01:24:41.593 --> 01:24:44.551
Why not, I mean, he's not
a part of Mister Academy.

01:24:44.553 --> 01:24:47.031
What do you say, Jules, you
ready to go head to head?

01:24:47.033 --> 01:24:48.293
I don't know.

01:24:48.295 --> 01:24:50.557
How's your stamina,
can you keep up?

01:24:50.559 --> 01:24:51.951
Like Superman.

01:24:54.301 --> 01:24:56.824
All right, Tino, I think
we can make this work.

01:24:56.826 --> 01:24:58.741
I accept your challenge.

01:24:59.524 --> 01:25:00.871
Fine.

01:25:00.873 --> 01:25:03.918
But if Bruno asks,
it was your idea.

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.180
Tino, I hope you don't mind.

01:25:05.182 --> 01:25:07.008
I mean, I know we had
a connection, but,

01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:08.183
well, you know.

01:25:08.185 --> 01:25:09.793
I understand.

01:25:09.795 --> 01:25:12.840
You'll just have to
remain in my dreams.

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:15.410
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that.

01:25:18.587 --> 01:25:21.544
You are getting
soft in your old age.

01:25:21.546 --> 01:25:23.372
Don't you say it.

01:25:23.374 --> 01:25:26.551
'Specially if you value
your family Jules.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.380
I take it back.

01:25:30.207 --> 01:25:31.034
Smart boy.

01:25:33.515 --> 01:25:36.429
Let's keep this professional,
I plan on winning.

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:38.433
Agreed, so, now what?

01:25:39.608 --> 01:25:40.870
We go to a pick-up joint.

01:25:42.175 --> 01:25:43.479
I don't know of any.

01:25:43.481 --> 01:25:44.306
I do.

01:25:44.308 --> 01:25:45.438
Come on, let's go.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.266
You're driving.

01:25:58.235 --> 01:26:00.453
So, what now?

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:04.544
Well, I guess we should go
find a place to pick up women.

01:26:04.546 --> 01:26:06.850
Well, that's not gonna work.

01:26:06.852 --> 01:26:07.636
Why not?

01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:09.638
I'm gay.

01:26:10.465 --> 01:26:11.986
Happy?

01:26:11.988 --> 01:26:14.423
Well, you're cute and funny.

01:26:14.425 --> 01:26:15.468
You know what I mean.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.516
Yeah, I'm just being shy.

01:26:19.778 --> 01:26:22.520
Well, what do you say
we ditch this competition

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:25.652
and we go get a drink?

01:26:25.654 --> 01:26:27.523
Rhonda would be furious!

01:26:27.525 --> 01:26:30.308
Look, life's too short
to sweat the small stuff.

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.182
Just, just one drink.

01:26:33.575 --> 01:26:35.313
Okay.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:36.708
Just one drink.

01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:38.797
Let's go.

01:26:46.675 --> 01:26:47.674
I bring 'em in.

01:26:47.676 --> 01:26:48.503
I put 'em away.

01:26:49.547 --> 01:26:50.633
All of them?

01:26:50.635 --> 01:26:52.505
So there was this one guy.

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:53.333
You here alone?

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.638
Yeah.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.033
Who's that woman you're with?

01:26:58.948 --> 01:27:00.730
She's just a friend.

01:27:00.732 --> 01:27:01.994
Is she seeing anyone?

01:27:06.129 --> 01:27:07.086
Check, please.

01:27:08.305 --> 01:27:10.523
So, you want to
get out of here?

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:11.741
Yes.

01:27:11.743 --> 01:27:12.960
All right, let's go.

01:27:12.962 --> 01:27:13.961
Not with you.

01:27:13.963 --> 01:27:15.399
Get the hell out of here.

01:27:18.576 --> 01:27:20.576
So, you come here often?

01:27:20.578 --> 01:27:21.534
No.

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:22.580
Okay.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.580
Can I buy you a drink?

01:27:24.582 --> 01:27:25.452
No.

01:27:31.589 --> 01:27:32.719
Where are we?

01:27:32.721 --> 01:27:34.503
I thought we were
going to get a drink.

01:27:34.505 --> 01:27:36.681
My house, we are, here.

01:27:41.817 --> 01:27:43.688
I have pepper spray.

01:27:48.084 --> 01:27:50.084
Actually, it's body spray,

01:27:50.086 --> 01:27:52.741
but it will still sting
your eyes really badly.

01:27:53.959 --> 01:27:55.611
You'll just smell nice
as you writhe in pain.

01:27:55.613 --> 01:27:57.308
Hey, man, we're cool.

01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:00.703
We're just gonna have a few
drinks on my porch, that's it.

01:28:00.705 --> 01:28:02.139
Okay.

01:28:02.141 --> 01:28:03.924
But I'm not going in your house.

01:28:03.926 --> 01:28:05.492
Okay, come on.

01:28:07.538 --> 01:28:09.582
In high school, I was
quarterback in a football team.

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:10.539
Star player.

01:28:10.541 --> 01:28:11.627
Oh, nice.

01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:13.020
What do you do now?

01:28:13.022 --> 01:28:14.021
Play league.

01:28:14.023 --> 01:28:15.631
Oh, full-time?

01:28:15.633 --> 01:28:17.809
Nah, only when I can get
a ride from the shelter.

01:28:19.637 --> 01:28:21.596
Check please, on him.

01:28:32.258 --> 01:28:33.085
Have a seat.

01:28:41.137 --> 01:28:42.138
I'll be right back.

01:29:13.996 --> 01:29:15.650
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:29:35.017 --> 01:29:35.844
Thanks.

01:29:37.454 --> 01:29:39.802
It's a really nice
house you have.

01:29:39.804 --> 01:29:41.761
Well, porch, actually.

01:29:41.763 --> 01:29:43.676
Well, thank you.

01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:45.634
Is that a spiral
staircase in there

01:29:45.636 --> 01:29:46.722
with all those lights?

01:29:46.724 --> 01:29:49.379
Yeah, it leads to
the master suite.

01:29:50.206 --> 01:29:51.684
Oh.

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:52.687
Lovely.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.080
I'd love to see that sometime.

01:29:56.212 --> 01:29:58.995
But not tonight.

01:29:58.997 --> 01:29:59.868
I know, I know.

01:30:03.741 --> 01:30:07.569
So, uh, how long have you
been working for Rhonda?

01:30:07.571 --> 01:30:09.745
Oh, just a couple of weeks.

01:30:09.747 --> 01:30:12.487
And it's been hell.

01:30:12.489 --> 01:30:13.793
Why is that?

01:30:13.795 --> 01:30:16.578
She's just, she's just
a very demanding person

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.580
and, and not very nice.

01:30:18.582 --> 01:30:19.973
You want me to slap
her around for you?

01:30:19.975 --> 01:30:21.757
No, stop it.

01:30:21.759 --> 01:30:24.542
She's just a bitter old bitch.

01:30:24.544 --> 01:30:26.066
So what do you do?

01:30:26.068 --> 01:30:27.284
I'm a hairdresser.

01:30:27.286 --> 01:30:30.723
Oh, I've been looking
for a new stylist.

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:33.856
I could give you a
makeover if you'd like.

01:30:33.858 --> 01:30:34.729
Oh.

01:30:36.339 --> 01:30:37.122
So.

01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:41.257
Tell me more about what
you would do to me.

01:30:58.274 --> 01:31:00.970
So, how many did you get?

01:31:00.972 --> 01:31:03.320
I don't know, I
haven't added 'em up yet.

01:31:03.322 --> 01:31:05.540
Just count up the
numbers that you got.

01:31:05.542 --> 01:31:06.802
Okay.

01:31:06.804 --> 01:31:09.415
I got one.

01:31:10.242 --> 01:31:11.504
How many did you get?

01:31:13.811 --> 01:31:15.115
Two.

01:31:15.117 --> 01:31:16.856
Twice as many as you.

01:31:16.858 --> 01:31:18.248
I win.

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:20.642
Yeah, you win.

01:31:20.644 --> 01:31:21.558
Where you going?

01:31:22.864 --> 01:31:23.908
I need some tunes.

01:31:41.883 --> 01:31:42.969
What is this?

01:31:42.971 --> 01:31:45.275
It's my newest creation.

01:31:45.277 --> 01:31:46.104
Do you like it?

01:31:46.888 --> 01:31:48.757
It's amazing.

01:31:48.759 --> 01:31:50.108
You're really talented, Jack.

01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.936
Thanks.

01:32:20.008 --> 01:32:20.965
I like you, Jack.

01:32:22.488 --> 01:32:23.925
Yeah, sure.

01:32:27.406 --> 01:32:29.929
I really do.

01:32:29.931 --> 01:32:30.975
I do, too.

01:32:31.889 --> 01:32:33.064
It's just.

01:32:34.892 --> 01:32:35.762
What?

01:32:37.547 --> 01:32:41.114
My track record
isn't the greatest.

01:32:41.116 --> 01:32:42.160
I want this to work.

01:32:43.901 --> 01:32:44.728
Really?

01:32:46.469 --> 01:32:47.296
Yeah.

01:32:48.514 --> 01:32:49.864
Can we go slow?

01:32:53.432 --> 01:32:54.433
Slow is good.

01:32:56.044 --> 01:32:57.132
I can be a turtle.

01:33:02.093 --> 01:33:04.485
You really are
a great guy, Jack.

01:33:04.487 --> 01:33:06.489
Yes, yes, I am.

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.969
We should get back
so we can see who won.

01:33:09.971 --> 01:33:11.971
I already know who won.

01:33:11.973 --> 01:33:12.928
Who?

01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:13.800
Me.

01:33:17.152 --> 01:33:20.501
Tino and Julian are
tallying up the scores.

01:33:20.503 --> 01:33:23.114
We will soon know
which school has won.

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:26.028
Everybody freeze, FBI!

01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:27.334
What the hell?

01:33:28.685 --> 01:33:31.468
Bruno, you're under
arrest for smuggling.

01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:32.948
Smuggling what?

01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:34.254
These.

01:33:34.256 --> 01:33:36.038
We caught up with the
rest of the packages

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.170
left in Jack's car.

01:33:37.172 --> 01:33:38.475
Damn it.

01:33:38.477 --> 01:33:41.000
I forgot to deliver the
rest of the packages.

01:33:41.002 --> 01:33:42.915
I'm sorry, Bruno.

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.003
Don't worry about it, Jack.

01:33:44.005 --> 01:33:46.092
You got nothing on me.

01:33:46.094 --> 01:33:47.399
Go ahead, open it up.

01:33:50.272 --> 01:33:53.055
These, drugs.

01:33:53.057 --> 01:33:54.491
You're an idiot.

01:33:54.493 --> 01:33:56.102
Those aren't drugs.

01:33:56.104 --> 01:33:57.059
Then what are they?

01:33:57.061 --> 01:33:58.321
Spices.

01:33:59.237 --> 01:34:00.628
Spices?

01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:03.283
Yeah, from my
import-export business.

01:34:03.285 --> 01:34:06.068
I supply 'em to
Chinese restaurants.

01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:07.115
Sorry, Bruno.

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.506
Sorry, huh?

01:34:09.508 --> 01:34:11.380
Tell that to the
judge and my lawyer.

01:34:12.294 --> 01:34:15.077
Now, get the hell outta here.

01:34:15.079 --> 01:34:17.125
Manny, show her the door.

01:34:21.172 --> 01:34:22.867
Spices.

01:34:22.869 --> 01:34:23.999
Rhonda.

01:34:24.001 --> 01:34:25.087
We have a problem.

01:34:25.089 --> 01:34:26.001
What is it?

01:34:26.003 --> 01:34:27.526
Well, take a look.

01:34:36.231 --> 01:34:39.362
What are we gonna do?

01:34:39.364 --> 01:34:41.103
I need to think.

01:34:41.105 --> 01:34:42.454
We both need to think.

01:34:44.935 --> 01:34:46.761
Attention, everyone.

01:34:46.763 --> 01:34:48.678
It appears we have a tie.

01:34:50.201 --> 01:34:52.201
Rhonda and Bruno are
reviewing the results

01:34:52.203 --> 01:34:55.380
and will have a decision for
you momentarily, thank you.

01:35:00.559 --> 01:35:03.258
Ladies and gentlemen,
please gather around.

01:35:04.868 --> 01:35:09.177
I'm sorry about the unexpected
intrusion and the delay.

01:35:10.439 --> 01:35:14.225
Rhonda and I have come up
with a solution to the tie.

01:35:15.705 --> 01:35:18.097
Nick, come on up.

01:35:18.099 --> 01:35:19.926
Gina, come on up here.

01:35:24.757 --> 01:35:27.062
We've decided to
have our top students

01:35:27.064 --> 01:35:29.630
compete to break the tie.

01:35:29.632 --> 01:35:31.503
- The winner will...
- Bruno, wait.

01:35:33.984 --> 01:35:35.636
Did you just interrupt me?

01:35:35.638 --> 01:35:38.987
Yes, I'm sorry, but
there isn't a tie.

01:35:38.989 --> 01:35:40.989
I didn't get any dates.

01:35:40.991 --> 01:35:42.034
I lied.

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.081
Yes, yes!

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.040
Why the hell
would you do that?

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:49.998
Because I didn't want to.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.218
Come on, Bruno, let's discuss

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.136
the details of your
surrender over some drinks.

01:35:56.528 --> 01:35:58.313
Okay, but you're
buying this time.

01:36:04.536 --> 01:36:06.321
Jack, why'd you do that?

01:36:07.452 --> 01:36:09.976
I may be a turtle,
but I know what I want.

01:36:12.805 --> 01:36:14.153
Well, Jack, it looks
like you finally learned

01:36:14.155 --> 01:36:15.937
how to treat a woman.

01:36:15.939 --> 01:36:18.157
I guess it took
the right woman.

01:36:18.159 --> 01:36:20.072
And the right man.

01:36:39.702 --> 01:36:41.180
So, spices, huh?

01:36:41.182 --> 01:36:42.270
Yeah.

01:36:43.619 --> 01:36:45.401
They didn't even look inside.

01:36:45.403 --> 01:36:47.101
What a bunch of idiots.

01:36:50.191 --> 01:36:52.106
So, what are we gonna do now?

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:55.150
I think we need a new plan.

01:36:55.152 --> 01:36:58.938
I was thinking about
opening up a new school.

01:37:00.331 --> 01:37:01.158
Manny,

01:37:02.638 --> 01:37:04.638
you ever been a model?

01:37:07.208 --> 01:37:10.254
Yeah, modeling
school, I like that.
