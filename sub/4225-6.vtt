00:01.000 --> 00:04.925
<i>The pro-treaty Paddles
and the King want the same man dead.</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:06.570
You've been chosen, Mr Shelby.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.883
The Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody King.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.247
For the last 10 years,
Sabini's made it his race.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.209
<i>If we're gonna take him down,
might as well make it there.</i>

00:14.600 --> 00:15.681
It's good to see you, Grace.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.166
Tommy, do you have someone?

00:17.240 --> 00:20.449
<i>The horse will come fifth or sixth.
But I will win you.</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:22.409
Mr Churchill was impressed.

00:22.480 --> 00:27.486
He has asked that the Colonial Office
grant him an Empire export licence.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.370
I want my son out of prison now.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.442
<i>He can be freed
by tomorrow morning.</i>

00:32.520 --> 00:34.921
<i>I'm talking about
a simple transaction here.</i>

00:35.000 --> 00:36.365
<i>I will carry out
your assassination</i>

00:36.440 --> 00:37.680
<i>at a place of my choosing.</i>

00:37.760 --> 00:39.000
Epsom.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.326
Derby Day.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.047
<i>My name is Thomas Shelby,</i>

00:46.120 --> 00:48.361
<i>and today, I'm going to kill a man.</i>

00:50.520 --> 00:52.045
<i>Today is Derby Day.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:55.246
<i>The murder will take place
this afternoon,</i>

00:55.320 --> 00:56.970
<i>at the Epsom races.</i>

01:04.800 --> 01:08.282
<i>It may be that I am able to escape
after the killing.</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:12.490
<i>The odds are not good,
which is why I am writing this letter.</i>

01:12.560 --> 01:16.042
<i>I've been forced by agents of the Crown
to carry out this murder.</i>

01:16.120 --> 01:20.125
<i>In the event of my own death,
I want the following facts to be known.</i>

01:21.000 --> 01:23.651
<i>My family are innocent
of any involvement.</i>

01:28.720 --> 01:30.643
Who are we?

01:32.840 --> 01:35.650
- Let's go.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.041
<i>And while some of them
may be guilty of other things,</i>

01:47.280 --> 01:50.124
<i>I've not shared details of this mission
with any of them,</i>

01:50.200 --> 01:52.282
<i>and no company assets were used.</i>

01:58.680 --> 02:01.604
<i>Agents of the Crown joined forces
with pro-treaty Fenians</i>

02:01.680 --> 02:03.045
<i>to arrange this murder.</i>

02:03.120 --> 02:06.886
<i>I believe the governments intend
to falsely blame the anti-treaty IRA.</i>

02:06.960 --> 02:09.360
<i>Therefore, the bullet I fire
this afternoon</i>

02:09.440 --> 02:11.966
<i>will be the starting gun
for civil war in Ireland.</i>

02:14.320 --> 02:15.890
<i>The man I have been
instructed to kill</i>

02:15.960 --> 02:17.325
<i>is Field Marshal Russell.</i>

02:17.400 --> 02:20.449
<i>Formerly a Black and Tan commander
who committed many atrocities</i>

02:20.520 --> 02:21.646
<i>in the county of Cork.</i>

02:22.840 --> 02:25.571
<i>There is no remorse in my heart
at the prospect of his death.</i>

02:26.360 --> 02:27.964
<i>However, the conspiracy
behind the killing</i>

02:28.040 --> 02:29.804
<i>is cause for international concern.</i>

02:30.640 --> 02:32.404
<i>Such is the gravity
of my secret mission,</i>

02:32.480 --> 02:35.689
<i>that after I have served my purpose,
I believe they intend to kill me.</i>

02:35.760 --> 02:36.761
Do you want tea?

02:36.840 --> 02:40.367
<i>I therefore want to name
a particular individual in this letter.</i>

02:41.920 --> 02:44.526
<i>The agent who has initiated
and orchestrated this crime</i>

02:44.600 --> 02:48.924
<i>is Major Chester Campbell of
the British Secret Intelligence Service.</i>

02:50.160 --> 02:53.448
<i>He chose me for this dirty business
as an act of vengeance,</i>

02:53.520 --> 02:56.364
<i>prompted by hatred of long standing.</i>

02:56.440 --> 02:58.124
<i>In the event of my death,</i>

02:58.200 --> 03:01.090
<i>it is imperative
he be brought to justice.</i>

03:01.160 --> 03:04.323
<i>If you are reading this,
then I am dead already.</i>

03:04.400 --> 03:07.324
<i>I hope that, living as you do
in a truly free country,</i>

03:07.400 --> 03:10.688
<i>you will be able to make the above facts
known to the world.</i>

03:10.760 --> 03:13.730
<i>Yours sincerely, Thomas Shelby.</i>

03:15.160 --> 03:17.606
Did you one anyway, you ignorant git.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.047
Ada, sit down here for a minute.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.130
Ada, if anything happens to me today,

03:31.920 --> 03:33.251
I need you to post this letter.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.730
The stamp's already on.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.486
Don't ask any questions,
it's to do with insurance.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.888
Look, Tommy,

03:48.080 --> 03:51.482
whatever it is you're involved in,
just tell us.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.524
God, you never let anybody in.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.291
We love you, Tom.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.841
What are you doing up
at 6:00 in the morning?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.725
- Ready?
- What the bloody hell's going on?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.804
- Little errand.
-What errand?

04:13.880 --> 04:16.486
- You just have to stand there, Ada.
-Stand where?

04:16.560 --> 04:19.166
- Let's go, come on.
flames, what's going on?

04:19.240 --> 04:22.449
Don't listen to him, James.
He'll get you killed.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.204
What errand?

04:24.280 --> 04:26.851
For the cause, Ada.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.331
The good old cause.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.363
Hands off cocks, on with socks.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.204
One at a time.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.964
One at a time, that's all I ask.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.921
You're getting out, Mr Shelby.

05:07.160 --> 05:17.121
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

05:18.280 --> 05:21.921
All 10 witnesses against you
withdrew their statements,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.240
last night.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.728
All at once. 9:00.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.928
Don't ask me why, because I don't know.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.162
The next 10 minutes, you don't do
or say anything I haven't told you.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.924
All right?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.161
- All right?
-Yeah.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.005
Hello, Ollie.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.766
Well, hang on. just you, yeah?

05:45.840 --> 05:47.126
He stays out here.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.531
Uh, you stay here.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.323
Johnny fucking Dogs.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.887
How did they get me
out of there?

06:35.960 --> 06:39.089
I need to get you to a telephone.
You need to make a call.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.844
It's all part of Tommy's plan.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.208
Apparently.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.449
That'll probably be for you, won't it?

07:03.320 --> 07:04.401
Hello?

07:05.360 --> 07:06.521
Arthur.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.566
You're out.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.210
Right, so that'll be your side
of the street swept up, won't it?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.206
Where's mine?

07:21.960 --> 07:23.405
What you got for me?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.048
Signed by
the Minister of the Empire himself.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.088
Yeah? So it is.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.445
This means that you can put
your rum in our shipments,

07:37.520 --> 07:40.490
and no one at Poplar Docks
will lift a canvas.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.040
You know what? I'm not even going
to have my lawyer look at that.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.804
- I know, it's all legal.
- You know what,

07:44.880 --> 07:48.282
mate, I trust you. That's that. Done.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.011
So, whisky...

07:52.200 --> 07:56.000
There is, uh, one thing, though,
that we do need to discuss.

07:56.080 --> 08:00.165
- What would that be?
-It says here, "20%

08:00.960 --> 08:03.406
"paid to me of your export business."

08:04.480 --> 08:07.006
- As we agreed on the telephone...
-No, no, no, no, no.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.562
See, I've had my lawyer
draw this up...

08:11.160 --> 08:13.367
...for us, just in case.

08:16.920 --> 08:22.165
It says that, here, that 100%

08:22.240 --> 08:25.722
of your business goes to me.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.607
- I see.
-It's there. Right.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.490
Don't worry about it, right,
'cause it's totally legal binding.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.201
All you have to do is sign the document
and transfer the whole lot over to me.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.081
- Sign just here, is it?
-Yeah.

08:41.159 --> 08:44.130
I see. That's funny. That is.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.401
- What?
-No, that's funny.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.881
"I'll give you 100% of my business."

08:53.640 --> 08:54.687
Yeah.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.207
Why?

09:02.520 --> 09:04.887
Ollie, no. No, no, no.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.964
Put that down.
He understands, he understands.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.247
He's a big boy, he knows the road.
Now, look,

09:10.320 --> 09:12.322
it's just non-fucking-negotiable.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.561
That's all you need to know.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.883
So all you have to do
is sign the fucking contract.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.371
- Right there.
-just sign here?

09:18.440 --> 09:20.727
- With your pen.
-I understand.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.802
Good. Get on with it.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.121
Well, I have an associate
waiting for me at the door.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.525
I know that he looks like a choir boy,
but he is actually an anarchist

09:32.280 --> 09:34.362
- from Kentish Town.
-Tommy...

09:34.440 --> 09:36.807
I'm going to fucking shoot you.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.211
All right?

09:38.280 --> 09:40.726
Now, when I came in here, Mr Summons,

09:40.800 --> 09:44.009
I stopped to tie my shoelace.
Isn't that a fact?

09:44.080 --> 09:45.081
Ollie?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.807
I stopped to tie my shoelace.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.245
And while I was doing it,

09:49.320 --> 09:51.721
I laid a hand grenade
on one of your barrels,

09:52.600 --> 09:54.921
Mark 15, with wired trip.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.403
And my friend upstairs...

09:57.480 --> 10:02.247
Well, he's like one of those anarchists
that blew up Wall Street, you know?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.651
He's a professional.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.650
And he's in charge of the wire.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.922
If I don't walk out that door
on the stroke of 7:00,

10:10.840 --> 10:14.128
he's going to trigger the grenade and...

10:14.200 --> 10:19.206
...your very combustible rum
will blow us all to hell.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.724
And I don't care...

10:26.240 --> 10:27.924
...'cause I'm already dead.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.925
He tied his lace, Alfie.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.571
- And there is a kid at the door.
-From a good family, too.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.085
Ollie, it's shocking what they become...

10:39.160 --> 10:41.128
What were you doing when this happened?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.210
He tied his lace, nothing else.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.611
Yeah, but what were you doing?

10:45.280 --> 10:46.805
I was marking the runners in the paper.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.361
What are you doing?

10:50.680 --> 10:52.921
Just checking the time. Carry on.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.727
Right, Ollie, I want you to go outside,
yeah, and shoot that boy in the face

10:57.800 --> 10:59.325
from the good family, all right?

10:59.400 --> 11:02.722
Anyone walks through that door
except me, he blows the grenade.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.926
- He tied his fucking lace...
-I did tie my lace.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.286
I bet, 100 to 1,

11:13.880 --> 11:17.487
you're fucking lying, mate.
That's my money.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.801
Well, see, you've failed
to consider the form.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.130
I did blow up me own pub...

11:22.640 --> 11:24.483
...for the insurance.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.481
OK right...
Well, considering the form,

11:30.920 --> 11:33.764
I would say 65 to 1. Very good odds.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.968
And I would be more than happy
and agree

11:36.040 --> 11:38.486
if you were to sign over
65% of your business to me.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.530
- Thank you.
-Sixty-five? No deal.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.409
- Ollie, what do you say?
- Jesus Christ, Alfie.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.369
He tied his fucking lace, I saw him!

11:45.440 --> 11:48.011
- Mmm-hmm.
-He planted a grenade, I know he did.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.170
Alfie, it's Tommy fucking Shelby...

11:53.760 --> 11:55.808
You're behaving like a fucking child.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.851
This is a man's world.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.881
Take your apron off,

12:00.960 --> 12:03.042
and sit in the corner like a little boy.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.889
Fuck off. Now.

12:10.840 --> 12:13.491
- Four minutes.
-All right, four minutes.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.722
--Talk to me about hand grenades.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.883
The chalk mark on the barrel,
at knee height.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.485
It's a Hamilton Christmas.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.642
I took out the pin
and put it on the wire.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.444
Based on this...

12:48.080 --> 12:49.605
...forty-five percent.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.682
- Thirty.
-Oh, fuck off, Tommy.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.125
That's far too little.

12:57.120 --> 13:01.045
In France, Mr Solomons,
while I was a tunneller, a clay-kicker.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.804
179.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.410
I blew up Schwaben Höhe.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.050
Same kit I'm using today.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.646
It's funny, that.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.368
I do know the 179.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.487
And I heard they all got buried.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.644
Three of us dug ourselves out.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.768
Like you're digging yourself out now?

13:27.400 --> 13:28.970
Like I'm digging now.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.045
Fuck me.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.281
Listen, I'll give you 35%.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.325
That's your lot.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.881
Thirty-five.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.601
- You're late.
-Hey, it's my business.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.925
How the fuck did you
get me out of that?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.889
I need you today, brother.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.962
I pulled some strings.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.485
- You all right?
-I am now.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.170
So Arthur's back in charge now?

14:22.240 --> 14:24.971
He's in charge of you,
and you're both in charge of him.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.289
Look-out duties only today.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.725
- Tom, I'm getting sick of this...
-Finn.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.201
You don't obey orders, you don't come.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.290
- Johnny Dogs.
-Tommy.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.727
- Your boys will meet us there?
- Well, at least they'll be there,

14:36.800 --> 14:37.801
Captain.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.041
- Captain?
-Ah, we promoted you.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.249
Well, the boys decided you're no longer
like a Sergeant Major.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.164
Fucking those rich women
and using those fancy words.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.723
I'd say you're more like a captain
these days.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.610
Fine, well, I'll take it
as a compliment.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.011
Just don't bloody shoot me.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.447
Let's go to the Derby, boys.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.966
All right, then! Load 'em up!

15:07.280 --> 15:08.327
Hello.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.328
No, I'm afraid Mr Shelby is in London.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.290
- He can't be reached.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.283
- No, he won't be back today.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.609
He's at the races.
The Epsom races, the Epsom Derby.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.091
Can I ask who's calling?

15:30.920 --> 15:32.410
I'm going to the station.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.441
- What's that?
-That money's yours.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.761
You take the money, you get a train,

16:14.840 --> 16:17.969
you start a new life in London.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.088
I don't want to see you here
when I get back.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.930
If I get back.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.367
Everything's an "if"
in this Birmingham life.

16:31.360 --> 16:35.843
You can write on Sundays
and visit on holy days.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.962
But I want you to wash this city
out of your hair and your clothes.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.849
It's what I should have done
at the start.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.763
Now I've got business to attend to.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.847
I do love you, Michael.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.491
I love you too.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.005
You'll miss your train.

17:42.840 --> 17:45.684
Me beloved greyhounds.

17:47.800 --> 17:48.961
Behold.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.169
Today's rabbit.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.205
When I give you the signal, I want you
to send that man to his maker.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.449
I decided to use you men
because I couldn't trust

18:06.520 --> 18:09.922
the hearts and the livers
of the English pansies and posies

18:10.000 --> 18:11.764
they'd given me as operatives.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.769
Right.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.882
This is a man of some capability,

18:20.000 --> 18:24.847
but I expect no excuses and no failures.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.446
The Red Right Hand
of the Ulster Volunteer Force

18:27.520 --> 18:29.522
will not let you down, Mr Campbell.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.284
The Red Right Hand.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.089
Good luck, gentlemen.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.770
Gentlemen, today,
we are not fucking about.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.444
I hope you've all obeyed instructions

18:59.520 --> 19:01.363
and brought loaded firearms with you.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.965
--Very good.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.964
You will all know that if you are lifted
on a racetrack these days

19:06.040 --> 19:07.849
with a loaded weapon, you get 20 years.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.605
That's all right.
Today, you won't get lifted.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.286
Because today, there will be
no coppers around to lift you.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.649
At exactly 3:00, there will be
an incident in the owners' enclosure

19:17.720 --> 19:20.326
and all the coppers on the track
will be diverted. All of them.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.448
They will be looking for someone.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.091
- So you will be free to operate at will.
-Looking for who?

19:25.160 --> 19:27.049
Me. They will be looking for me.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.724
Now, while the coppers are busy with me,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.404
you will make your move
on Sabini's pitches.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.131
You will confiscate his takings,
you'll destroy his licences,

19:33.200 --> 19:34.440
and you do it at gunpoint.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.330
He usually has police protection,
so they won't be armed.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.086
We should aim to complete the takeover
without a shot being fired, understood?

19:41.160 --> 19:45.563
And remember, the licences are
more important than the takings.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.608
All right. Before the fun begins,

19:47.680 --> 19:49.842
you can all lay 10 bob
on Nom de Guerre.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.125
- I hear she's going to win.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.728
Only beer beforehand, boys, and plenty
of time for rum and whisky after.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.250
And remember,
do not make a move until 3:00.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.926
When the coppers leave. That is all.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.527
Incident? What are you going to do

20:07.600 --> 20:11.082
that's going to make every copper
at the Derby look the other way?

20:11.800 --> 20:12.881
Trust me, brother.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.926
Ten, please.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.529
She threw a shoe coming out of the box.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.401
Eh?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.530
She looks in fine shape.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.369
Hello, hello, hello.

21:12.440 --> 21:15.523
I missed you, buck. Missed you, buck.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.805
- Should I be worried?
-You should not.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.410
Go and drink, enjoy the day. I'll come
and find you when the race is done.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.884
Hmm, that's nice. Is that yours?

21:32.720 --> 21:35.200
My mother wore it to the Derby in 1895.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.242
She was presented to Queen Victoria.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.330
After the race,
I'll change in the horse box

21:41.400 --> 21:43.801
and then come and join you up there
with the toffs, what do you say?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.968
Hmm. Yeah.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.406
You don't want me to join you.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.841
It's fine.
I'll stay down here in the mud.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.967
Whatever happens today, it was good.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.165
You mean, win or lose?

22:20.360 --> 22:22.249
Yeah. Win or lose.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.843
You know, I never watch the race.
Can't stand it.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.686
I always like to find somewhere
dark and quiet.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.925
Tommy?

22:38.520 --> 22:40.090
If you can't find me up there,

22:41.320 --> 22:43.004
I'll come and find you later.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.250
What do you mean?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.765
Whatever happens, May,

22:49.200 --> 22:52.443
no regrets. No regrets.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.531
And I will find you.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.126
All right.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.926
Remember that.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.007
Bye.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.850
Put this on Nom de Guerre.

23:28.760 --> 23:29.841
Good day, sir.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.486
There he is.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.404
Fucking meatball blokes.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.526
Right, let's go.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.686
I have to talk to you.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.891
- Grace. What are you doing here?
-I have to talk to you.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.326
Grace.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.125
This is not a good time.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.722
What's all this about? Please excuse us.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.044
Whatever it is, Grace,
it'll have to wait.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.964
It can't wait.
It wasn't me who is at fault.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.361
I'm pregnant.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.731
The baby's yours.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.926
Better believe...

25:18.080 --> 25:19.844
Make your husband believe that it's his.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.524
Is that what you want me to do?

25:21.600 --> 25:24.524
Grace, I seriously have things to do.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.090
It's not worth the toss
of a coin this time?

25:26.160 --> 25:29.562
Grace, I have things to do.
When they are...

25:29.640 --> 25:32.086
When they are done, I will decide.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.650
- When will that be?
-After the race.

25:33.720 --> 25:36.326
After the race?
After the fucking race, Tommy?

25:36.400 --> 25:38.402
When the race is over
I will decide what to do.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.642
What to fucking do, all right?

25:40.720 --> 25:44.691
But Tommy...
I was right not to tell him?

25:45.840 --> 25:48.571
I could have phoned him and lied,
but I didn't.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.085
Just tell me that I was right.

25:50.160 --> 25:54.643
Not to phone and lie.
Agree with that, Tommy.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.891
Yes. Yes, Grace.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.371
Because the thing is...

26:03.200 --> 26:04.929
...I love you, not him.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.090
That is a thing.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.886
A baby, Thomas.

26:17.560 --> 26:18.721
Yes.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.444
- Go to your race.
-Where will you be?

26:25.520 --> 26:26.760
I'll be waiting.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.844
I'll wait where they lay their bets.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.971
Found a lost sheep.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.120
Come on, Lizzie.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.689
- What do you think?
-About what?

27:14.360 --> 27:16.442
- About the dress?
-Undo two buttons. Come on!

27:23.960 --> 27:26.531
Oh Tommy, I never thought
I'd see the like of this.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.886
Yeah.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.211
But I do know that
I'm here to work,

27:30.280 --> 27:32.044
so you may have noticed
I haven't taken a drink.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.326
Well, here.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.727
Take this. You might need it.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.242
What's the work you want me
to do here today, Tommy?

27:45.440 --> 27:46.885
Is it taking notes in a meeting?

27:47.280 --> 27:49.806
No, Lizzie.
You're not here to take notes.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.449
My shorthand won't be required.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.047
Lizzie...

27:59.800 --> 28:02.724
There's a man here
and I need him separated from the crowd

28:02.800 --> 28:05.849
-and taken to a quiet place.
-A quiet place...

28:06.160 --> 28:08.766
- Lizzie, I know what I said.
-Yeah, you know.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.887
You know, you told me I shouldn't
do that kind of work any more.

28:11.960 --> 28:14.247
I just need you to isolate him, is all.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.561
No exceptions, you said.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.291
I've drawn a map, all right,

28:19.360 --> 28:21.124
of where exactly you need to take him.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.849
For months I made no exceptions
because you told me not to.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.251
Lizzie...

28:26.320 --> 28:28.971
just keep him busy.
I have the place marked with an "X"

28:29.040 --> 28:32.647
and I'll get to you before it can start,
I promise. All right?

28:35.040 --> 28:37.008
I mustn't smudge my eyes,
he might not like that.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.366
Lizzie...

28:38.440 --> 28:42.729
...this is the only time.
After this, never again.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.251
All right, I'll pay an extra five...

28:45.320 --> 28:47.322
Do not talk to me about money now.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.449
Not right now, I swear
I'll break this glass in your eyes.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.322
No exceptions,
there's been no hardship.

28:57.680 --> 28:58.727
You know why?

29:01.600 --> 29:02.681
Hmm?

29:06.440 --> 29:07.885
Doesn't matter.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.601
Who is he?

29:10.920 --> 29:13.890
- To your right. Soldier.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.723
Smoking a cigarette.
just be alone with him at 3:00.

29:17.800 --> 29:21.043
When the race starts,
and I'll do the rest. Yeah?

29:21.680 --> 29:22.727
Got a piece of chalk?

29:23.320 --> 29:25.721
- Chalk?
-It's how the soldiers know.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.041
It doesn't matter,
just give me the fucking chalk.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.091
Lizzie, it's gonna be all right. Eh?

29:42.080 --> 29:45.050
I'll get to you, I promise.
Before it can start.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.771
I will be there.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.881
Keep them fuckin' guns ready.
Keep them guns ready.

30:08.880 --> 30:13.329
Coppers aren't moving.
Stood there like fucking gargoyles.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.923
Keep your wits about you,
boys, all right?

30:52.600 --> 30:53.761
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

30:53.840 --> 30:56.605
<i>the race will begin in four minutes.</i>

30:56.680 --> 30:58.967
<i>So please make your way trackside.</i>

31:19.760 --> 31:21.285
Shouldn't you be busy?

31:23.760 --> 31:25.330
When you've planned
something well,

31:25.400 --> 31:27.050
there's no need to rush.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.446
Do you know something?

31:30.160 --> 31:32.401
I actually trust you to do this.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.290
Do you think there might be some...

31:39.440 --> 31:42.330
...measure of respect
developing between us?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.164
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:44.240 --> 31:47.528
<i>runners and riders are coming to order,
please take your seats.</i>

31:47.600 --> 31:51.366
Old foes that have grown
to admire each other,

31:52.360 --> 31:55.170
and see each other's
professional virtues.

31:58.440 --> 32:01.683
Personally, I think not.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.246
I think not.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.446
Well, I drink to that.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.850
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

32:10.920 --> 32:14.049
<i>please be upstanding
for the national anthem.</i>

32:19.040 --> 32:21.884
It's always the plan
that you'll stay together forever.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.485
Or perhaps she'll whore for you,

32:26.560 --> 32:29.689
take her husband's money.
Is that the plan?

32:31.480 --> 32:33.323
How wrong I was about her.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.561
I was wrong about her as well.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.531
You once said to me,

32:45.360 --> 32:47.681
that men like us can never be loved.

32:49.560 --> 32:53.360
She loves me. She told me.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.164
She loves me.

32:58.880 --> 33:03.966
And all you got was a bullet
and a fucking wolf head cane.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.123
Well. Bully for you.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.684
This I know.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.051
Ahead of you is damnation,

33:17.120 --> 33:20.249
but I have the love of God,

33:20.320 --> 33:22.402
and the certainty of salvation.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.529
I know what you did to Polly.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.803
I know what happened
to my uncle in jail.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.683
Today, it'll be me dead,

33:51.440 --> 33:54.284
or you, but whoever it is,

33:54.840 --> 33:56.922
gonna wake up in hell tomorrow.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.250
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34:03.320 --> 34:06.529
<i>the runners and riders
are under starter's orders.</i>

34:10.159 --> 34:11.889
<i>- And they're off!</i>

34:33.000 --> 34:35.286
Come on girl, come on.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.404
At least make a showing.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.484
Come on, Tommy.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.560
What a pretty dress.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.401
Take it off.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.042
Let's take this off first, shall we?

35:21.120 --> 35:24.408
Lift up your dress
and show me that you're clean.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.562
Hmm.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.282
Do as you're told!

35:31.120 --> 35:34.044
We should take it slow, we've got time.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.722
- This area's closed off.
-What?

35:43.800 --> 35:45.165
The King will be coming this way
after the race.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.810
- This area is secure!
-But I need to...

35:46.880 --> 35:48.848
- You'll have to go round.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.562
- Get the fuck off!
- You bitch!

36:04.640 --> 36:05.801
Fuck off!

36:05.880 --> 36:07.609
Get the fuck off me!

36:20.160 --> 36:21.730
- Hey!

36:29.640 --> 36:31.005
- Russell!

36:31.080 --> 36:32.081
Fuck!

36:50.560 --> 36:51.800
Stop it!

37:17.640 --> 37:19.722
- Lizzie...
-Where were you?

37:19.800 --> 37:22.610
- Where the fuck were you?
- Give me the gun, Lizzie.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.523
Lizzie, Lizzie.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.046
- I'm sorry.
-Fuck off, fuck off!

37:28.120 --> 37:29.406
Just go.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.241
Go on, go!

37:44.160 --> 37:45.730
Officers. Officers!

37:45.800 --> 37:47.006
I was taking a shit

37:47.080 --> 37:50.402
and I heard voices, Irish voices
and I heard a shot.

37:50.480 --> 37:53.006
I swear to God,
there's a soldier lying dead in there.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.160
Get every man in uniform
around the King.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.767
Every man in uniform around the King.
Right now!

38:03.960 --> 38:05.564
The IRA are on the course.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.801
Everyone to the King.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.126
All right, my pretty boys. This is it.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.965
Right. Ready.
You get round the back.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.371
Come on. Don't bunch.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.011
Right, you stay with us.
I want you to stay back!

38:22.080 --> 38:23.081
Let's go!

38:26.560 --> 38:28.164
Put your hands in the air!

38:31.080 --> 38:32.206
Turn around!

38:38.360 --> 38:39.600
Is there a problem?

38:39.680 --> 38:41.330
Fenians on the course.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.801
A soldier's been shot, someone said
there was an Irishman in here.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.086
That is correct.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.886
Very sorry, sir.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.206
Check the security to His Majesty.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.247
I will now take your mind off
the situation.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.690
Mr Sabini, you're late.
Have a seat.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.041
What happened to your nose?

39:54.120 --> 39:55.963
You want to have that brother
of yours put down.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.644
Oh, I tried that. He bit the vet.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.726
I've told the coppers that you're
a fucking gypsy racketeer Peaky Blinder.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.689
They're coming.
They're gonna throw you out.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.250
Before the King comes up here.

40:07.840 --> 40:12.050
Well, from what I saw
the police are a bit busy right now.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.968
Did you win any money today, Mr Sabini?

40:19.280 --> 40:20.611
Where are the coppers?

40:21.680 --> 40:25.810
Said to that sergeant, "one minute",
he said, "two", it's fucking ten!

40:25.880 --> 40:29.965
Like I told you, they're a bit busy.
Same as my boys.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.122
- What the fuck does that mean?
-What does that mean?

40:32.760 --> 40:35.047
Well, my boys are on the track.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.804
They're having a little bonfire.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.363
Gaming licences, you know.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.366
Fuck!

40:48.560 --> 40:53.600
You place too much reliance on
the police for your security, Mr Sabini.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.091
That was a mistake.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.091
You're gonna now
think about who you are,

40:59.160 --> 41:01.162
think about where you are.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.320
You pull a weapon,
you are the King's assassin.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.607
Now sit down, stay calm.

41:11.800 --> 41:12.801
Good.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.931
Now your next mistake, Mr Sabini,

41:17.520 --> 41:20.967
was breaking your promise
with Alfie Solomons.

41:22.200 --> 41:27.411
Hmm. You promised Alfie
that his bookies could come to Epsom.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.364
He was very hurt when you said no.

41:31.440 --> 41:32.805
He was very hurt.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.880
That's why me and Alfie
are back in business.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.363
Hold it! Hold it!

41:54.440 --> 41:56.966
It's all right,
it's all right, Officers.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.884
He's just a bad loser.
What the fuck? Hey!

42:01.240 --> 42:05.211
You fucking lose,
you fucking gypsy bastard!

42:05.280 --> 42:06.930
You lose!

42:11.760 --> 42:13.649
What the fuck are you looking at?

42:14.200 --> 42:16.009
Step back, move.

42:16.640 --> 42:18.802
You're now a prisoner
of the Red Right Hand.

42:24.920 --> 42:27.400
Now, take his hat and gun.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.965
Get him up.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.520
Easy.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.406
Take a seat.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.761
Sit down!

42:44.480 --> 42:45.481
That's it.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.367
You make yourself nice and comfortable.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.807
We're just going for a wee drive,
Mr Shelby.

42:56.840 --> 42:57.966
Let's go.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.121
I guessed and then John confirmed it.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.001
Guessed what?

43:38.840 --> 43:39.921
Who are you?

43:40.680 --> 43:42.091
I'm May Carleton .

43:42.600 --> 43:44.523
I train Tommy Shelby's horse.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.321
And you're the woman who he said
was going to sail away.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.648
I see he didn't tell you about me.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.684
He did tell me about you,
I wonder if that's significant.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.000
Tell me what about you?

44:02.080 --> 44:03.809
Do you have any idea where he is?

44:06.560 --> 44:07.925
I'm waiting for him here.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.369
There's been trouble on the track.

44:18.840 --> 44:21.047
All the bookies have had
their licences burnt.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.485
Shouldn't you be down with the horses?

44:22.560 --> 44:24.767
Which means they'll have to re-apply
for their legal pitches.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.007
It's all part of Tommy's plan
for the future.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.245
What do you know about Tommy's future?

44:30.320 --> 44:32.402
The applications will be denied,
of course.

44:32.480 --> 44:35.802
Then all the pitches will be
allocated instead to Tommy's bookies.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.964
I know because I'll make sure of it.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.884
I have influence with the board.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.842
- There's business and there's love.
-Is there?

44:54.160 --> 44:55.650
There's Thomas Shelby.

44:59.520 --> 45:01.887
- What do you want from him?
-Same as you.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.484
I want to feel alive.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.049
Did he tell you my name?

45:24.840 --> 45:26.285
My name is Grace.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.842
In your statement
to the House, sir,

45:36.320 --> 45:39.085
I believe that you should say
that witnesses

45:39.160 --> 45:41.686
heard the killer say that

45:41.760 --> 45:45.765
they were members of the IRA
and that the killing was in retribution

45:45.840 --> 45:49.367
for actions of the Field Marshal
in County Cork.

45:52.520 --> 45:54.682
Oh, our friend from Birmingham?

45:55.800 --> 45:57.450
He's been taken care of.

45:58.640 --> 45:59.641
Oh...

46:00.560 --> 46:02.289
A very good day, sir.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.247
- Thank...

46:06.280 --> 46:08.044
Sorry, I must go.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.684
Goodbye.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.521
Polly.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.044
Tommy told me you'd be here.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.361
And I told Tommy it should be me
who finishes you.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.565
Small and weak.

46:35.480 --> 46:37.084
That's how you like it, isn't it?

46:38.440 --> 46:41.011
Well, this time small and weak
has got a gun.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.402
No, you wouldn't do that here.

46:45.480 --> 46:46.641
No.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.884
Do you see any coppers?

46:51.040 --> 46:52.849
Well, I don't.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.922
They're all around your precious King.

46:57.960 --> 46:58.961
Ah.

47:10.920 --> 47:13.002
Polly, Polly...

47:15.800 --> 47:18.451
- Some part of you...
-I have no parts.

47:18.520 --> 47:21.126
Some part of you wanted me as well.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.964
I know that, I felt it.

47:24.520 --> 47:28.730
And sure as hell some part of me
wants you still.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.605
And not just that part, but...

47:33.800 --> 47:35.768
some part of my soul.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.485
Some part of my soul.

47:39.640 --> 47:43.087
Curious how that is to me
and curious that it should be you.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.683
Opposites perhaps.

47:47.360 --> 47:50.409
Opposite, and that...

47:52.400 --> 47:54.971
That thing sticking in my heart,

47:55.040 --> 47:58.965
you own, you own part of that heart,
you do.

47:59.520 --> 48:02.364
You do, Polly. You do.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.765
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.085
Let's get you home.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.481
Come on.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.282
Look at this place, we own it!

49:26.960 --> 49:29.327
Put your money away
before I take it off ya.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.050
- Fuckin' clean up!
-Get up!

49:32.840 --> 49:35.730
Lizzie, what the fuck
are you doing here?

49:35.800 --> 49:39.122
- Working for Tommy, same as all of us.
-You work for the Blinders.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.680
- What happened to you?
- Fell over.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.330
Oh, don't fuckin' give me that.

49:44.240 --> 49:45.241
Lizzie...

49:46.200 --> 49:48.043
Come here, come here.
Come here, come here.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.771
--Eh? Were you working?

49:51.560 --> 49:52.641
Yeah?

49:53.680 --> 49:56.081
Thought you'd earn yourself a few bob
at the races, eh?

49:56.600 --> 49:58.443
It's gotta stop, Lizzie.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.727
It's gotta stop,
Tommy's already told you.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.167
Toffs at the races are the worst,
you know that.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.447
Hey, come here, come here.
Look at me.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.081
Cheer up.

50:09.800 --> 50:11.529
We won.

50:11.640 --> 50:13.324
We fucking took Epsom.

50:13.480 --> 50:15.801
We kicked the Cockneys' fucking arses.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.370
Congratu-fucking-lations.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.204
We fucking beat them,
all right.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.886
John didn't even shoot his gun!

50:22.000 --> 50:25.800
We're kings! Kings of the fucking world!

50:27.160 --> 50:31.927
John, I don't see the same thing
in your eyes that I see in Tommy's.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.805
You should get out.

50:36.520 --> 50:37.646
You should get out.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.330
Where is Tommy, anyway?

51:51.600 --> 51:53.409
Any of you boys in France?

52:00.440 --> 52:02.363
You know, I wouldn't mind a cigarette.

52:05.840 --> 52:06.966
The Somme.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.721
Black Woods.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.005
Somme, the Bulls.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.891
Smoke.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.280
So fucking close.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.130
So fucking close.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.282
Oh... And there's a woman.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.081
Yeah.

53:09.440 --> 53:10.441
A woman...

53:12.720 --> 53:14.051
...who I love...

53:16.200 --> 53:17.725
...and I got close.

53:24.160 --> 53:27.846
Nearly got
fucking everything!

53:53.360 --> 53:54.566
Oh, what the fuck?

53:57.360 --> 53:58.691
Get it done, boys.

54:09.880 --> 54:10.881
Comrade,

54:12.040 --> 54:13.371
we have our orders,

54:14.680 --> 54:15.806
you know how it is.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.286
I know how it is.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.285
In the bleak midwinter.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.609
At some point in the near future,

54:45.680 --> 54:49.480
Mr Churchill will want to speak to you
in person, Mr Shelby.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.571
He has a job for you.

54:54.680 --> 54:56.170
We will be in touch.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.124
Get out of the grave, tinker.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.643
Be on your fucking way!

55:35.880 --> 55:36.881
Fuck!

56:17.480 --> 56:18.811
Right!

56:21.000 --> 56:25.528
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to raise a toast.

56:27.360 --> 56:31.331
- To the Small Heath Rifles.
- Small Heath Rifles.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.084
To the Lane Boys.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.404
And to the Peaky fucking Blinders.

56:44.080 --> 56:46.321
Who's gonna stop us, eh?

56:59.840 --> 57:01.251
Nobody.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.004
Polly and I had a bet.

57:31.360 --> 57:32.930
One of us bet

57:33.960 --> 57:35.644
you'd take the money and go.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.930
And one of us bet you'd still be here.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.284
She wants me to stay.

57:46.720 --> 57:49.087
Mmm, you know something, Michael?

57:51.920 --> 57:53.365
What Polly wants

57:55.560 --> 57:58.689
will always be a mystery to me.

58:09.800 --> 58:11.165
I've decided.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.204
I want to make real money

58:16.120 --> 58:17.645
with you.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.528
I've got some ideas, Michael.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.043
For the future of the company.

58:51.680 --> 58:53.125
