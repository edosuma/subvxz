<i>WALDRON: So many years
I wondered</i>

00:06.400 --> 00:08.289
<i>what I'd do if
I ever saw him again.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:11.802
And then I did.
In a photo, in a briefing room.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.127
<i>And I was being sent
to meet him with a gun.</i>

00:19.240 --> 00:21.766
<i>ARNOTT. I don't think we
should close the investigation</i>

00:21.800 --> 00:24.929
<i>into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.</i>

00:24.960 --> 00:26.610
(Mumbles)

00:26.640 --> 00:28.290
What's he saying?

00:32.159 --> 00:33.730
This is a young Ronan Murphy,

00:33.760 --> 00:36.161
shot by Danny Waldron
during Operation Damson.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.531
What'? They knew each other?

00:37.560 --> 00:39.483
Did you fabricate
the improper relations

00:39.520 --> 00:41.363
- between you and DS Arnott'?
- No.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.165
Did you fabricate the planting
of evidence against you'?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.082
- What is your verdict?
- Not guilty.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.451
It is with deep regret
that I inform you all

00:52.480 --> 00:54.767
of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.487
Hari initiated
the struggle with that gun

01:01.520 --> 01:04.602
and it's only his word for it
that it was self-defence.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.925
I owe you an apology
for the other night.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.962
Your...dinner invitation.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.207
You're a married man.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.924
This is it.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.962
Danny Waldron purposefully
created a trail of evidence.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.651
And now we're on the trail
of the other abusers.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.206
Dale Roach. He was leader
of the city council

01:25.240 --> 01:27.322
during the period Danny Waldron
and Joe Nash

01:27.360 --> 01:29.044
were residents at Sands View.

01:29.080 --> 01:32.209
The things
they did to us at Sands View.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.846
I promise you
I will get these bastards.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.646
If Bains killed Danny,

01:38.680 --> 01:41.490
I'd lay you evens
he killed Kennedy as well.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.727
<i>You're being fitted up
for murdering Rod Kennedy.</i>

01:43.760 --> 01:46.684
(Cockney accent) lf you want
a way out, you'll listen to me.

01:50.920 --> 01:54.970
<i>Did he ever mention any other
names? Politicians, coppers?</i>

02:01.800 --> 02:03.723
Single-handedly
brings in an APO...

02:03.760 --> 02:05.762
Welcome back, Dot.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.729
(Phones ringing)

02:14.840 --> 02:16.842
<i>BENTON". I'd just like
to get on with my life.</i>

Ms Denton, I'm Gill Biggeloe,
Legal Counsel to AC-l 2.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.641
Mm. I imagine
they keep you very busy.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.091
Ha.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.569
Have a seat.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.685
You know
Superintendent Hastings.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.324
I do.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.010
As pan of a new initiative

03:07.040 --> 03:10.169
christened
Truth and Reconciliation,

03:10.200 --> 03:12.089
following
a miscarriage of justice,

03:12.120 --> 03:14.407
parties are invited
to engage in dialogue

03:14.440 --> 03:16.249
to initiate the healing process.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.760
There seems to be an oversight.
Some of the officers

03:18.800 --> 03:21.167
involved in my wrongful
conviction are missing.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.682
Superintendent Hastings,
as Senior Investigating Officer,

03:24.720 --> 03:26.484
represents the whole team.

03:26.520 --> 03:31.128
Well, I want them here. Or this
new box you need to tick just...

03:31.160 --> 03:34.164
well, won't get ticked.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.322
God give me strength.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.568
Thank you. It wouldn't have been
the same without you.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.567
Ms Denton, on behalf
of this department

04:04.600 --> 04:06.170
and this constabulary,

04:06.200 --> 04:09.761
I offer you a sincere
and unconditional apology

04:09.800 --> 04:11.689
for your wrongful conviction

04:11.720 --> 04:14.610
in respect of the offence
of conspiracy to murder.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.731
Ted.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.524
Uh... As the senior
investigating officer,

04:23.560 --> 04:27.087
I acknowledge your feelings
regarding your conviction.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.841
Wrongful...conviction. And you
haven't actually said sorry.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.762
Maybe you'll do better,
DS Arnott.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.207
You require me to sign off
that I accept your apology.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.449
I won't unless it comes from
the officers who wronged me.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.006
You're out.
What more do you want'?

04:50.040 --> 04:53.203
An...apology.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.288
Jesus Christ.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.570
This isn't going
very well at all, is it'?

05:02.320 --> 05:04.129
Ted.

05:06.120 --> 05:12.002
As senior investigating officer,
I apologise for your conviction.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.882
You omitted "wrongful".

05:14.920 --> 05:17.366
But thank you,
that's very gracious.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.331
DS Arnott'? We're all waiting.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.885
Your allegation that I planted

05:24.920 --> 05:27.207
incriminating evidence
against you is false.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.483
Point of information.
I've made two allegations.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.524
One, you engaged in
inappropriate sexual relations

05:33.560 --> 05:35.562
whilst on
an undercover operation

05:35.600 --> 05:39.525
and, two, you planted Â£50,000
to simulate a bribe.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.562
- And it's all crap.
- Steve.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.807
Really? Do tell.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.605
Lindsay Denton knows
our procedures inside out.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.564
She exploited grey areas to tie
our investigation in knots.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.125
Oh, you did that
all by yourself.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.686
First DC Fleming's
failed undercover operation

05:53.720 --> 05:55.210
and then yours.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.368
I didn't do too badly.
You ended up in prison.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.721
And we didn't fail.
We got you convicted.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.491
But you know sexual misconduct
by undercover officers

06:02.520 --> 06:05.364
is a hot topic so you invented
this story about us going to bed

06:05.400 --> 06:07.607
so the jury sees you
as a wronged woman.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.529
They felt I shagged you
into conspiring

06:09.560 --> 06:11.927
- to murder a protected witness.
- Steven.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.570
Thank you, DS Arnott.
I couldn't agree more

06:17.600 --> 06:20.046
that the question
of your sexual integrity

06:20.080 --> 06:22.401
quite rightly
made the jury sceptical.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.842
But I've got a recording that
will be of interest to you all.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.963
All right, then. This just
isn't the time or the place.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.482
Now is exactly the time
and exactly the place.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.881
Not in court, in a room full of
rubberneckers and reporters,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.922
my pathetic private life
laid out

06:40.960 --> 06:44.203
for everyone to laugh at,
to pity. I couldn't bear that.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.447
But to show you all
what kind of officer

06:47.480 --> 06:52.611
got me locked up
for 585 miserable days of that,

06:52.640 --> 06:54.642
that I can live with.

06:56.320 --> 07:01.121
I've had my whole life put on
trial...and now it's your turn.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.447
You've been charged and tried
but the one person

07:03.480 --> 07:06.131
that refuses to examine
what you're accused of is you.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.609
I'm innocent.
The question is, are you'?

07:12.360 --> 07:15.603
This phone was next to
the bed the entire time,

07:15.640 --> 07:19.247
although I can believe that you
were too preoccupied to notice.

07:20.280 --> 07:24.126
Would you like me to...
play it for everyone'?

07:32.200 --> 07:34.202
DS Arnott'?

07:34.240 --> 07:35.890
No.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.522
Christ sake, Steve.

07:46.680 --> 07:50.651
Well. I feel this meetings
been remarkably successful,

07:50.680 --> 07:52.967
and I'd be very happy
to record in writing

07:53.000 --> 07:56.129
that it's been a healing process
for all parties.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.481
I'd also prefer it
if you'd consider closed

07:58.520 --> 08:00.761
the matter of DS Arnott's
sexual impropriety.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.485
I don't intend to make
a statement of evidence.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.528
The people that actually did the
crime that I was imprisoned for,

08:07.560 --> 08:09.164
they're still out there.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.602
Superintendent, you uphold the
integrity of the police service.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.247
If you held one iota of doubt
about my conviction,

08:16.280 --> 08:19.204
no officer would be more
troubled by that than you,

08:19.240 --> 08:22.767
no officer would do more
to right that wrong.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.280
I plan to move on with my life.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.402
You won't move on, Steve,

08:27.440 --> 08:29.647
until you stop chasing me,

08:29.680 --> 08:32.001
and you start chasing
your real enemies.

08:40.919 --> 08:44.288
For Christ's sake, son!
What was in that phone'?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.527
We've got to take
that crap from her, sir'?

08:46.560 --> 08:50.360
You lied in court, you lied to
your partner and you lied to me!

08:50.400 --> 08:52.448
I didn't lie, sir.
It's just not appropriate

08:52.480 --> 08:55.484
to discuss an officer's private
life. I don't quiz you on yours.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.002
What do you mean by that'?
I'm a married man.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.610
I know, sir, I just...

09:00.640 --> 09:03.769
It isn't "private" when it's
bandied about in a court of law!

09:03.800 --> 09:06.485
What matters, sir,
is whether I planted evidence.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.488
Are there any forensic anomalies

09:08.520 --> 09:11.205
in respect of the money
found at Demon's address? No.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.847
Are the Exhibit Officer's
records inaccurate?

09:13.880 --> 09:16.963
That is not the issue!

09:17.000 --> 09:20.004
It's completely the issue.
I did not plant evidence.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.884
If... If I had sex with
Lindsay Denton, which I didn't,

09:22.920 --> 09:24.843
does that stop her being guilty?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.207
Lindsay Denton
has left the building.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.362
Steve Arnott should do the same.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.163
Discreditable conduct.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.329
Steve Arnott
did not plant evidence.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.170
But it's OK to have
a relationship with a suspect?

09:58.200 --> 10:00.521
I can see
how you feel about this, Ted.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.369
Why defend the indefensible'?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.164
He can be
an irritating wee gobshite

10:04.200 --> 10:06.043
when he wants to be,
I'll give you that.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.208
Why'? Because
you personally recruited him

10:08.240 --> 10:10.163
from Counter-Terrorism,
and that means

10:10.200 --> 10:11.884
you having
to admit misjudgement.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.720
Sorry, Ted, I intend to return
to this conversation.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.002
Kate.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.521
Kate, wait. Please.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.440
One time you told me
Lindsay Denton had din on you.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.925
Remember what I said'?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.962
Maybe some people
always tell the truth.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.809
The rest of us
choose our moments.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.888
That's what I did.
To ensure evidence was put

10:40.920 --> 10:42.809
in front of a jury
that would convict her

10:42.840 --> 10:44.604
of a crime
we all know she committed.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.371
But we don't know. The only
person who knows is Lindsay.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.643
We gather the evidence. The
people decided she didn't do it.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.762
Because you couldn't
keep it in your pants.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.848
- That's not what happened.
- What happened?

10:54.880 --> 10:56.564
It was an operation in which

10:56.600 --> 10:58.284
I nurtured
the trust of the target.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.891
That is straight out of the
manual, and total bollocks.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.763
You shagged her
because you wanted to.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.201
- I didn't shag her.
- This is all a bit too late.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.402
You should have told me
the truth and given me

11:07.440 --> 11:10.842
the chance to work with you on
this. That's what partners do.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.290
<i>ARNOTT. For the tape,
image 313 is a photograph</i>

12:26.320 --> 12:29.483
of item reference NTW-7.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.170
The said item is a rope

12:31.200 --> 12:33.521
found hanging
from an overhead support

12:34.440 --> 12:36.920
<i>DI Cottan has given a statement
where you attempted</i>

12:36.960 --> 12:40.328
<i>to overpower him with the intent
of causing death by hanging.</i>

12:40.360 --> 12:43.284
The exact same means
as PC Rod Kennedy.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.970
I didn't murder Rod

12:45.000 --> 12:47.606
and I absolutely didn't attempt
to murder DI Cottan.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.008
- In fact, DI Cottan set me up.
- He "set you up"?

12:51.040 --> 12:53.042
<i>Yeah. Cottan
smashed himself in the face</i>

12:53.080 --> 12:55.128
<i>to make it look like I hit him.
But I didn't.</i>

12:55.160 --> 12:58.960
As for the rope, he must have
planted it there beforehand.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.082
He'll say anything
to save his own skin.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.724
Yeah.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.331
Why would an officer of mine
do such a thing? Huh'?

13:05.360 --> 13:07.806
To frame me for Rod's murder.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.011
Do you have anything to support
these claims against DI Cottan?

13:15.600 --> 13:20.288
For the tape, the interviewee is
offering no supporting evidence.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.971
Moving on... DS Arnott.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.083
For the tape, Image 291,
item reference MR-S,

13:26.120 --> 13:29.169
and Image 292,
item reference MR-4.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.202
MR-S and 4 are mobile phones.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.247
A Section-18 search
of your property

13:34.280 --> 13:36.681
<i>recovered two unregistered
pay-as-you-go phones</i>

13:36.720 --> 13:38.722
<i>concealed in the garage.</i>

13:38.760 --> 13:41.445
Document 16. Analysis
of activity on these phones

13:41.480 --> 13:43.403
reveals they made
and received calls

13:43.440 --> 13:46.922
within the telecommunications
cell covering your home address.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.645
Three nights before the murder
of Danny Waldron,

13:49.680 --> 13:51.409
a call was received
by one phone.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.522
Who called you'?

13:53.560 --> 13:55.449
No comment.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.962
Document 16 again. The night
before Danny Waldron's murder.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.731
- Another call.
- Who called you that night'?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.887
Calls of a suspicious nature
were made

14:05.920 --> 14:08.526
shortly before you volunteered
to continue serving

14:08.560 --> 14:11.689
on Danny Waldron's squad
and before you murdered them.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.291
Who made those calls
and what did they ask you to do'?

14:20.480 --> 14:25.088
<i>For the tape, the interviewee
is not answering.</i>

14:25.120 --> 14:26.929
<i>This pattern of communication,</i>

14:26.960 --> 14:29.531
unregistered pay-as-you-go
phones, used briefly,

14:29.560 --> 14:32.211
then discarded,
is used by organised crime.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.242
Who's got you in their pocket'?

14:35.640 --> 14:37.165
Nobody.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.488
Hari, we have you receiving

14:39.520 --> 14:41.488
phone calls linked
to Danny's murder.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.490
We have you lobbying
to stay on Danny's squad.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.522
We have your hands
all over the firearm.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.087
We have you consistently lying
about Danny's activities.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.964
We have a witness who says
it was you who did all this,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.607
and not PC Rod Kennedy.
We have you at the murder scene

14:56.640 --> 14:59.371
and in possession of the
instruments of Kennedy's death.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.641
Now, that's about
the height of it,

15:01.680 --> 15:03.444
and it's a great big
pile of evidence

15:03.480 --> 15:06.051
that is gonna crush you flat.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.449
Now, come on.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.762
You killed Danny Waldron.
Yes or no'?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.968
Yeah. Yeah.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.562
Good.
Now we're getting somewhere.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.961
We know you can't
have been acting alone.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.729
Help us help you.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.166
Who gave the order
to kill Danny Waldron'?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.441
Who was it'?

15:44.480 --> 15:46.528
It...

15:46.560 --> 15:48.722
<i>Come on. Who was it? Who was it?</i>

15:48.760 --> 15:51.161
You've got the bastard.
Come on, talk.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.970
- He never gave me a name.
- Who didn't'?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.002
The bloke I always spoke to.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.408
He sounded like he was a
Londoner, Southeast, or summat.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.041
<i>It</i> was <i>all</i> done over the phone,
weren't it?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.082
<i>I never met anyone, like.</i>

16:08.120 --> 16:10.122
You've got to know more.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.208
Times, places, other contacts.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.720
Someone's behind all this,
pulling the strings,

16:14.760 --> 16:16.762
and I want to know who it is.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.001
Ronan Murphy, the suspect
killed by Danny Waldron.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.361
- What do you know about him'?
- Nothing.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.164
They had history, Danny and him.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.562
- That's news to me.
- Danny shot Murphy

16:30.600 --> 16:32.568
and was going after
Murphy's associates.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.365
They wanted Danny dead.
The job you did for them.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.449
I didn't know Murphy.
I don't know his associates.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.323
I don't know
why they wanted Danny dead.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.964
Look, who's behind this'?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.241
What was Danny onto
that meant you had to kill him'?

16:53.760 --> 16:55.762
Have you nothing further to say'?

16:59.760 --> 17:01.967
<i>You have offered
nothing new in this interview</i>

17:02.000 --> 17:04.731
<i>to mitigate you being charged
with the following offences.</i>

17:04.760 --> 17:07.604
<i>I</i> therefore have the authority
from the Crown...

17:07.640 --> 17:09.324
- We got the bastard.
- Yeah.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.931
They should throw away the key.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.803
<i>...murder of PC Roderick
Kennedy. Two,</i>

17:13.839 --> 17:17.002
<i>the murder of PS Daniel Waldron,
and three,</i>

17:17.040 --> 17:19.327
the attempted murder
of DI Matthew Cottan.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.567
Do you understand?

17:58.160 --> 18:01.050
I've been doing more work
on the Ronan Murphy file.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.406
There's a small entry-
blink and you'd miss it -

18:05.440 --> 18:07.442
that he was interviewed
by a Murder Squad,

18:07.480 --> 18:09.767
in relation to
unsolved gangland murders.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.282
But there's no details of the
offences he was being linked to.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.528
I can't help you.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.807
How many times
are we gonna go over this'?

18:21.840 --> 18:23.968
Lindsay lied in court
to con the jury.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.241
Maybe you're thinking,
if he'd shag a suspect,

18:26.280 --> 18:27.566
who else is he gonna shag'?

18:27.600 --> 18:29.682
I can't help you
because I've never heard of

18:29.720 --> 18:32.644
any Murder Squad investigation
into Ronan Murphy.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.809
If I had, don't you think I'd
have bloody told you by now'?

18:41.120 --> 18:44.203
<i>"Still subject to delays due to
over-running engineering work.</i>

18:46.200 --> 18:48.248
For fucks sake!

18:52.160 --> 18:54.845
Making all your money are you'?
Eh'?

18:57.360 --> 18:59.966
You bunch of bleeding twats!

19:00.000 --> 19:02.002
Huh?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.565
You shithouse!

19:05.600 --> 19:07.602
You bunch of bastards!

19:07.640 --> 19:09.642
(Siren approaching)

19:10.600 --> 19:13.729
Oh, here they are.
Come on, then. Great.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.962
They should rip it down...

19:20.080 --> 19:22.287
...and smash every brick of it.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.721
Joe, we've spoken to
the officer handling your case.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.967
No-one's gonna press charges.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.442
Those bastards.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.970
They're gonna get away
with what they done to us.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.404
You know I'm gutted Dale Roach
is unfit to face prosecution.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.284
But, listen, Joe, we're looking
into the complaints

19:43.320 --> 19:45.687
made by you, or Danny,
or any of the other lads,

19:45.720 --> 19:48.564
to the police about the abuse
you were made to suffer.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.602
By staff and visitors.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.482
Any police that came...

19:58.200 --> 20:00.282
...they just talked to the staff.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.163
I mean, they was the bastards

20:02.200 --> 20:04.441
who were organising it
in the first place.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.642
And anyone that talked about it,

20:07.680 --> 20:09.682
they just got it
ten times worse.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.165
We're doing everything we can,

20:15.200 --> 20:17.441
but we still need your help,
Joe.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.006
We're particularly interested
in this man.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.327
You identified him
as a football coach.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.802
His name's Ronan Murphy.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.401
Did you or anyone you know
ever make a complaint about him'?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.442
Yeah, there was one time.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.202
A social worker.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.966
He did nothing.
Nothing was done.

20:44.640 --> 20:48.645
- What social worker'?
- Just some posh twat.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.682
Posh to us, anyway.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.087
We need a name, Joe.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.566
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd,
a registered social worker

20:58.600 --> 21:00.329
with responsibility
at Sands View.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.681
He was a council employee
around the time

21:02.720 --> 21:05.451
that Danny Waldron
and Joe Nash were residents.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.484
Only record found so far
is of a disciplinary hearing

21:08.520 --> 21:11.410
accusing Stephens-Lloyd of
dealing cannabis to residents.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.364
He denied the charges and
insisted he was being victimised

21:14.400 --> 21:17.006
because he'd raised concerns
about abuse at Sands View.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.724
All other records
have been lost,

21:18.760 --> 21:21.843
reported destroyed in a fire
or lost in an office move.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.407
The tribunal report's existence
is probably an oversight

21:25.440 --> 21:27.329
by whoever's
been destroying records.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.522
All we have so far
is Stephens-Lloyd

21:29.560 --> 21:32.928
alleging individuals -
many in positions of authority -

21:32.960 --> 21:35.167
were pan of
a network of abusers.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.168
He referred to
compiling a list of names

21:37.200 --> 21:38.690
he'd passed on to the police,

21:38.720 --> 21:41.530
but it appears none of his
allegations were investigated.

21:41.560 --> 21:45.042
And regarding this list and
the officer it was passed to...

21:45.080 --> 21:47.924
No record. We'll keep looking.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.724
- Find this social worker.
- Sir.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.162
Terrific presentation, guys.
Honestly, really terrific.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.884
Steve.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.446
Before Danny died,
he tried to say something.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.723
I thought he said "Listen..."
and couldn't get any more out.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.240
Now I reckon
what he said was "list".

22:07.440 --> 22:09.442
Cheers, Kate.

22:20.360 --> 22:23.762
Maneet, the evidence recovered
from Danny Waldron's flat.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.728
- Uh...yeah.
- The empty envelope.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.726
Ronan Murphy was shot dead
in the heat of the moment.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.240
But Linus,
Danny had time with him.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.089
Time to get information.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.842
Let's see.

22:39.680 --> 22:42.001
They never tested the envelope.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.042
What'?

22:45.880 --> 22:47.609
Bloody Forensics.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.927
They're on a tight budget
this financial year.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.964
I don't care about their budget.
Get it tested now.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.809
Thanks, Maneet.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.004
So...
what was all that about, then'?

23:05.800 --> 23:08.531
This is where Stephens-Lloyd's
body was found.

23:08.560 --> 23:13.202
This is the original report...
dated 21 st November, 1998.

23:13.240 --> 23:16.289
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd was last
seen a few weeks beforehand.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.846
His body was found
on the 14th by a fisherman.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.167
- Statement's in the file.
- What's going on'?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.731
I've asked Murder Squad
if they'll reopen the case.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.762
- Right.
- Hiya.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.723
- All right.
- You all right'?

23:31.760 --> 23:34.730
We just re-interviewed the
fisherman who found the body.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.730
He recalls that pretty much
the first thing he was told

23:37.760 --> 23:40.047
at the scene
was that it had to be a suicide.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.845
Also it appears no photos or
videos were taken of the scene.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.644
Was there
a missing persons report

23:45.680 --> 23:47.444
or investigation at the time?

23:47.480 --> 23:50.324
There was. The report's cursory
to say the least.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.489
It doesn't look as if anyone
was actively searching for him.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.323
The SIO at the time
was a DI Marcus Thurwell.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.124
He's no longer serving,

23:59.160 --> 24:01.288
but we're doing our best
to track him down.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.926
The pathologist's
autopsy report at the time

24:03.960 --> 24:06.930
stated the body had superficial
wounds and a broken arm,

24:06.960 --> 24:09.850
which he put down to the body
being struck by a boat.

24:11.320 --> 24:14.244
So my boss has agreed
to reopen the case.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.090
We're already seeking permission
to exhume the body.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.768
We'll be taking this from here.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.689
We've got an ongoing interest.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.724
It's ours now but we'll keep you
in the loop as best we can.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.326
Seems like you're
in everybody's good books.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.642
(Coughing in background)

24:38.400 --> 24:41.722
<i>Ticket number 41 , Booth 15.</i>

24:44.000 --> 24:46.128
MAN: You know
how long I've been waiting.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.369
- You need to complete the form.
- I've done all the forms!

24:50.000 --> 24:52.002
- Lindsay?
- Yes.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.930
My name's Tammy.
I'm one of the Multidisciplinary

24:54.960 --> 24:56.849
Offender Management Team.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.564
Is this your first appointment?

24:58.600 --> 25:01.809
Yep.
I'm ready to restart my life.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.524
Lovely.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.562
By re-joining
the police service.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.364
MAN: Bollocks to this.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.402
Bollocks to the...

25:10.200 --> 25:11.770
Uh...

25:11.800 --> 25:13.848
You were acquitted
of conspiracy to murder,

25:13.880 --> 25:16.121
but guilty of perverting
the course of justice.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.686
Yes. I'm appealing
against the conviction.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.802
I'm gonna clear my name.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.047
You can't rejoin the police
with a conviction.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.889
I told you, I'm appealing.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.810
Have you actually checked
to see that I can rejoin'?

25:27.840 --> 25:29.285
No, I haven't checked.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.210
I would like to apply to rejoin
the police service.

25:34.280 --> 25:37.363
I'm sorry. Why are you
looking at me like that'?

25:37.400 --> 25:39.641
I don't know you,
I've got nothing against you,

25:39.680 --> 25:41.569
but I can't help you
if you're in denial.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.729
You're an offender, which means
no chance to rejoin the police.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.730
- Yet I'm not a criminal.
- Let's look on the bright side.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.843
Try getting you into work.
Everything follows from that.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.284
OK.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.606
Well, I...
I was a detective inspector.

25:59.640 --> 26:02.120
So I've got
a valuable skill set.

26:14.360 --> 26:16.442
(Children giggling)

26:23.600 --> 26:26.763
So. Any news on them forensics?

26:26.800 --> 26:28.802
Uh, yes, sir.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.723
There were notable findings
on the inside of the envelope

26:32.760 --> 26:34.967
recovered
from Danny Waldron's flat.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.087
They found
a number of tiny stains,

26:38.120 --> 26:41.408
less than a millimetre across.
Ink. Standard biro.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.442
Could have belonged to anyone.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.482
And blood.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.170
- And that'd be Danny's, right'?
- No, sir.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.089
It matched to Linus Murphy's.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.008
The final report states
these findings

26:54.040 --> 26:56.088
are consistent with
a blood-stained note

26:56.120 --> 26:57.690
written during or shortly after

26:57.720 --> 27:00.564
Danny Waldron's torture-murder
of Linus Murphy.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.526
Should I send a copy
to DS Arnott, sir'?

27:09.560 --> 27:12.530
No. No, I'll handle it for now.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.244
And...

27:14.280 --> 27:16.806
And this is just
between us for now'?

27:19.120 --> 27:21.122
Nice one.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.967
(Muffled music in background)

27:41.000 --> 27:43.002
(Sobbing)

27:44.400 --> 27:46.402
(Knocking)

27:48.000 --> 27:50.002
Who is it'?

27:50.040 --> 27:53.283
Robin, from the Offender
Management Team.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.770
(Raised voices nearby)

27:59.800 --> 28:01.529
Come in.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.885
Were you issued
with the information leaflet'?

28:19.560 --> 28:21.562
Good.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.921
This is difficult for you.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.327
And we're here to help you
pick up the pieces.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.488
How long do I have to stay here'?

28:30.520 --> 28:34.286
You served half your sentence
and now you're out on licence.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.322
You understand all this,
of course.

28:40.040 --> 28:45.126
We want to help you move on,
but it's not gonna be easy.

28:45.880 --> 28:49.965
You're gonna need money
for rent, for living expenses.

28:54.440 --> 28:58.331
I can help you now, if you want.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.768
Ten quid.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.769
What are you saying?

29:11.800 --> 29:14.565
I was just going through
the role of the MOMT

29:14.600 --> 29:16.921
in your adjustment
to life after prison.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.721
Nice meeting you, Lindsay.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.286
We both have
such busy schedules.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.448
I don't think
the taxpayer will mind.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.569
(He chuckles)

29:51.560 --> 29:53.688
Shame I'm gonna
ruin the evening.

29:53.720 --> 29:57.327
Right. Well, you know
you can speak freely.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.200
I can't tell you
how to run your department,

30:02.240 --> 30:04.527
but I want you
to move Steve Arnott on,

30:04.560 --> 30:07.006
make him some other
department's problem.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.088
Let me tell you
about Steve Arnott.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.202
He's my most
dogged investigator.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.369
He will not leave
a stone unturned.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.768
I had intended that meeting
in a more social setting

30:17.800 --> 30:20.531
would make this less
confrontational between us.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.562
Yes, well...

30:22.600 --> 30:25.001
We've only just got started.

30:29.120 --> 30:34.126
I would like the chicken liver
pate, then the sea bass.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.764
I'll be right back.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.121
Thanks. I'll have the soup

30:38.160 --> 30:42.324
followed by the sirloin steak...
medium-well,

30:42.360 --> 30:44.362
and er...

30:45.480 --> 30:47.164
..no sauce.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.402
What's the matter?

31:29.280 --> 31:31.089
I'm a married man.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.848
Separated.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.882
I took vows.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.762
I can't undo them.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.802
Don't you want to stay with me,
Ted'?

31:47.960 --> 31:51.282
I'm sorry, Gill. I'm sorry.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.528
(Cheering on TV)

32:04.560 --> 32:07.131
I don't need to watch this,
if you want something else.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.049
It's fine.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.804
(TU off)

32:19.000 --> 32:21.002
You hungry'?
Do you want to go out'?

32:21.800 --> 32:23.450
I'm tired.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.930
Yeah. All right.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.404
I need to tell you what I found
out about Ronan Murphy.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.650
What, you looked into it'?

32:36.240 --> 32:37.924
Murphy was a person of interest

32:37.960 --> 32:40.247
to the inquiry into the murder
of Tommy Hunter.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.164
In what way'?

32:43.200 --> 32:46.409
Ronan Murphy was one
of Hunter's closest associates.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.442
We never interviewed him.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.123
Major Violent Crime did.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.530
Ronan Murphy was interviewed

32:53.560 --> 32:56.166
about the conspiracy Lindsay
Denton was convicted of'?

32:56.200 --> 32:59.886
- Looks like it.
- None of this was in the file.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.922
It must have been doctored.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.644
You didn't get
any of this from me.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.084
Well, well.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.482
Who'd have thought?

33:21.520 --> 33:23.761
What are you after'?

33:25.400 --> 33:27.050
You ever heard of Ronan Murphy'?

33:27.080 --> 33:28.570
Why do you ask'?

33:28.600 --> 33:30.648
I just thought
you might have heard the name.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.568
Are you reopening my case'?

33:35.600 --> 33:38.251
Forget it, all right.
That's not why I'm asking.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.846
I don't expect you to care,
Steve,

33:42.880 --> 33:45.850
but I'm never ever gonna get
back to being that person I was

33:45.880 --> 33:47.882
before all this happened.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.287
The only thing
that kept me sane,

33:50.320 --> 33:52.288
the thing
that got me up in the morning,

33:52.320 --> 33:54.322
was being a police officer.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.045
I want to find the people
that framed me, Steve.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.801
And I believe, I hope,
that you do, too.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.364
The audio file on this phone

34:05.400 --> 34:07.687
is as embarrassing to you
as it is to me.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.563
Believe you me,
I've got it backed up.

34:12.239 --> 34:14.242
I don't enjoy
threatening people.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.402
They make me.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.286
Ronan Murphy
was killed by a police officer.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.005
Murphy was a prime suspect
in the murder of Tommy Hunter

34:28.040 --> 34:30.520
but for some reason
that's been hidden from AC-12.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.289
Bring in the officer
that killed him.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.846
- He was killed two weeks after.
- Why?

34:36.560 --> 34:38.562
Oh, come on, Steve.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.485
Best guess, he was breaking open
a paedophile ring.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.210
What'?

34:47.560 --> 34:49.050
Don't you see'?

34:51.360 --> 34:52.850
Ronan Murphy was interviewed

34:52.880 --> 34:55.884
by the team investigating
Tommy Hunter's murder.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.647
And where did you get that from'?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.847
I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.450
Here we go again.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.647
Hunter was involved
in grooming underage girls

35:09.680 --> 35:12.604
and pimping them out. And
he was about to turn informer.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.290
The people
who ordered his murder

35:14.320 --> 35:16.926
didn't want what he knew
about exploitation to come out.

35:16.960 --> 35:20.169
That's exactly the same motive
as the murder of Danny Waldron.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.202
They're connected.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.289
Sir, we know Hunter's murder
was orchestrated by the Caddy,

35:25.320 --> 35:28.449
and there's evidence someone was
pulling Hari Bains's strings.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.529
Using the same methods as
the Caddy - voice contact only,

35:31.560 --> 35:32.925
multiple phones.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.042
Yeah, but...

35:35.080 --> 35:37.651
how can this be the Caddy'?
DC Cole is dead.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.286
Well, the Caddy
is my inquiry, sir.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.288
So maybe I should be
the one to look into it'?

35:42.320 --> 35:44.322
- Yeah, I'd be grateful.
- Sir.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.283
- Sir.
- What?

35:46.320 --> 35:48.721
Something to say'?

35:48.760 --> 35:50.888
Or are you not at liberty'?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.002
Sir.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.280
I know exactly
who we should speak to first.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.802
- Who'?
- We'll be fine, thanks, Steve.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.763
You see. The thing is, mate,

36:04.800 --> 36:07.531
no-one likes their partner
holding out on them.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.404
So...where you taking me'?

36:11.440 --> 36:14.330
To the lying bastard
who told us the Caddy was dead.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.282
COTTAN: Why don't you
let me handle this'?

36:22.320 --> 36:24.402
He's a chippy bastard.
If I'm there,

36:24.440 --> 36:26.647
there'll be a witness
to who said what.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.806
Cheers.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.762
Dot?

36:34.800 --> 36:36.609
Mate.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.244
What's all this, then'?

36:38.280 --> 36:40.886
We're following up on
a statement you made in 2013

36:40.920 --> 36:43.366
in connection with
the murder of Tommy Hunter.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.970
OK if we come in'?

36:52.120 --> 36:54.202
You have done well for yourself,
eh.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.004
You, too.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.042
Landed on your feet,
you might say.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.842
Crime Audit.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.770
We gather important figures
for important figures.

37:07.800 --> 37:12.089
So how can I be
of assistance to AC-12'?

37:12.120 --> 37:15.522
This report - sensitive parts
of which are net fer your eyes -

37:15.560 --> 37:17.961
quotes your statement
regarding DC Cole.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.688
DI Cottan wrote this. I'm sure
he can shed any light required.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.210
This is just routine, Nige.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.288
We're just following up
en one er two details.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.407
Are these your words'?

37:29.440 --> 37:31.010
"DC Cole was nicknamed the Caddy

37:31.040 --> 37:33.611
because he were golf jumpers
but never played golf.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.449
He boasted of
underworld connections

37:35.480 --> 37:38.006
and attempted to recruit me
into a clandestine network

37:38.040 --> 37:39.610
of corrupt police officers."

37:39.640 --> 37:41.927
I cooperated
with your investigation.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.531
But we've got
some new lines of inquiry.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.040
Did Cole ever mention
a gangland associate

37:47.080 --> 37:49.651
of Tommy Hunter
named Ronan Murphy'?

37:54.600 --> 37:57.729
Right.
You pointed the finger at Cole.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.728
You led everyone
up the garden path.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.240
Meanwhile,
we've get two Coppers murdered.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.567
I'm not saying another word
without a solicitor.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.285
Fine. We'll continue
this conversation at AC-12,

38:07.320 --> 38:10.369
under caution,
the date to be appointed by us.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.404
Thank you.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.242
Sir.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.282
You have to shut this down.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.130
I will not let anyone
put you on the spot about Cole.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.162
We both know why.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.328
Shut...this...down.

38:32.360 --> 38:35.204
Now. Or you know
the secrets I can spill.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.930
Why don't you come into AC-12
with your solicitor?

38:40.960 --> 38:43.725
You tell us you heard
the Caddy rumour about Cole

38:43.760 --> 38:47.367
off of some old lag,
dead or lost his marbles.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.767
And you leave me to do the rest.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.082
And'?

38:53.120 --> 38:55.122
There's always an "and".

38:56.360 --> 39:01.571
And...you turn over all the
stuff you've got on me. End of.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.602
End of'?

39:04.800 --> 39:06.802
The incriminating item
I've got on you,

39:06.840 --> 39:08.604
that's my only insurance.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.246
- You need me to shut this down.
- I'm small fry.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.884
You're the big fish.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.887
So what'll happen
when they find out about

39:16.920 --> 39:19.161
all that evidence
you've been sitting on'?

39:19.200 --> 39:21.521
The contacts in that phone,

39:21.560 --> 39:24.803
the call history -
all in my past, mind.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.041
That isn't summat
anyone could shut down.

39:31.520 --> 39:34.285
Now you're, what,
six months off retiring'?

39:34.320 --> 39:36.004
Four and a half.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.042
Look.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.686
I wasn't more than a kid
when all this started.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.765
Certain people pushed me
into joining the Force

39:44.800 --> 39:47.007
to do their dirty work
from the inside.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.805
And the truth is, mate,
I want to retire, too.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.962
Just in a different way.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.124
But I can't do that
till I'm free of the past.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.162
And you could be free, too.

40:00.280 --> 40:03.807
Four and a half months, that's
you walking off into the sunset.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.762
None of this hanging over you.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.648
What's going on'?

40:25.640 --> 40:27.642
OK, he's here.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.802
Nige.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.728
<i>Now,
the purpose of today's interview</i>

40:34.760 --> 40:37.650
is to re-examine a statement
provided voluntarily

40:37.680 --> 40:41.287
by DC Morton
on October 17th, 2013.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.368
This is Document 1
in your folders.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.411
- Is this your statement?
MORTON: It is.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.250
And do you now wish to amend
your statement in any way'?

40:51.280 --> 40:52.805
I do.

40:52.840 --> 40:55.241
DC Jeremy Cole
was a corrupt officer,

40:55.280 --> 40:58.170
the son there's no room for
in the police service.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.521
What he got up to sickened me.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.450
I did have occasion to meet Cole
and he did at one time

41:03.480 --> 41:06.404
boast about his connections
to underworld figures.

41:06.440 --> 41:08.363
Did you report Cole?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.921
Although this is
a voluntary interview,

41:11.960 --> 41:14.930
I request the professional
courtesy of being questioned by

41:14.960 --> 41:16.962
an officer
at least one rank superior.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.162
Why didn't you report Cole
at the time?

41:20.200 --> 41:23.010
I thought he was a lippy kid.
He was full of it.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.042
I didn't believe his boasts.

41:26.080 --> 41:29.687
Much later...
I learned about his offences.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.405
If only I'd acted,
I might have prevented them.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.442
I'm extremely remorseful.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.170
In regards to your statement
of Cole being the Caddy,

41:38.200 --> 41:40.680
would you new like to make
any further amendments?

41:40.720 --> 41:42.961
I never heard Cole himself
use that nickname.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.606
I got it from another source
and I passed it on.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.769
I should have made that clear
in my original statement.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.529
I'm extremely remorseful.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.722
Who was the other source?

41:52.760 --> 41:57.482
An old friend from my days on
Armed Robbery, Terry Capistrano.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.931
And do you have
any further information?

42:00.960 --> 42:04.601
No, sir, only that
I'm extremely remorseful.

42:06.560 --> 42:09.564
Well, thank you, DC Morton.
No further questions.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.364
Interview terminated.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.329
Wanker.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.723
Right. I'll check out
this name he gave us.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.330
I wouldn't bother if I were you.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.762
Terry Capistrano
got Alzheimer's.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.485
He was retired, sick. The
poor bugger's lost his marbles.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.602
- Convenient.
- Come off it, Kate.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.847
- Nige was just trying to help.
- Can we be sure'?

42:42.880 --> 42:44.848
I know he's a mate
and everything,

42:44.880 --> 42:46.723
but he's
a few months off retirement

42:46.760 --> 42:48.842
and his missus
hasn't been too well lately.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.803
I really don't give a shit.

42:50.840 --> 42:52.968
Look,
his head's in the right place.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.882
Let's just leave this cock-up
behind us, eh'?

43:00.200 --> 43:01.850
Please.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.011
Yeah. Well, I suppose
I can overlook it.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.804
Thanks.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.604
I really appreciate it.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.768
Now we know
the Caddy's active again.

43:12.800 --> 43:15.007
But this time
we get the bastard.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.482
ROBIN: Lindsay?
- (Knocking)

43:29.400 --> 43:31.402
Thank you.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.442
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.602
What's this about?

43:39.040 --> 43:43.443
I'm afraid I've heard that
you've been absent from work.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.562
I'm concerned
that you're not coping.

43:46.600 --> 43:50.241
And if you got into trouble
again, you'd return to prison.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.567
I'm never going back to prison.

43:55.480 --> 43:57.482
(Sirens passing outside)

43:57.520 --> 44:00.763
But you can't afford
to lose that job.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.762
What did you expect
for ten quid?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.448
I was trying to help you.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.724
20.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.722
Argh!

45:15.080 --> 45:18.562
Now...don't you try
making up any lies about this!

45:18.600 --> 45:20.682
Because it's all on video.

45:20.720 --> 45:23.041
You can't do that!
It's illegal!

45:23.080 --> 45:24.889
You're saying
that I can't record you

45:24.920 --> 45:27.082
without your prior knowledge

45:27.120 --> 45:29.771
as a breach of Article 8
of the Human Rights Act?

45:29.800 --> 45:32.565
I'll take your act
and I'll raise you Section 4

45:32.600 --> 45:35.570
of the Protection from
Harassment Act, 1997,

45:35.600 --> 45:38.080
and your offence under that act

45:38.120 --> 45:40.930
carries a maximum prison
sentence of five years!

45:43.400 --> 45:45.482
I'll see you in court

45:45.520 --> 45:47.522
(He groans)

45:48.440 --> 45:50.442
Argh!

46:12.880 --> 46:15.963
- Where's Maneet'?
- Off sick, I heard.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.685
There's some forensics
I asked her to chase up.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.722
Oh. You'll just have to wait.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.003
Kate's get a postmortem report
fer you, if you're interested.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.444
Thanks.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.922
Yeah. If you just
get a couple of...

46:32.960 --> 46:35.566
You've got a new PM
on Oliver Stephens-Lloyd'?

46:36.160 --> 46:38.208
Yeah.

46:38.240 --> 46:40.447
Were you gonna get round
to telling me'?

46:41.240 --> 46:43.163
Yeah.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.969
The new autopsy found

46:46.000 --> 46:48.241
significant differences
from the original.

46:48.280 --> 46:51.523
Both arms were broken and there
was a severe skull fracture.

46:51.560 --> 46:54.803
Which isn't consistent with
a flat surface like a boat hull.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.842
It looked
more like a hammer blow.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.211
Right.

46:58.240 --> 47:01.528
Look at the original PM, the
distribution list at the end.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.644
Routine distribution
to senior officers at the time.

47:06.680 --> 47:08.523
Routine except for one name.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.369
Chief Superintendent Fairbank

47:10.400 --> 47:12.926
had nothing to do with
this case. He ran Vice.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.361
Also copied in
on the missing persons report.

47:15.400 --> 47:18.006
What do we know about
Chief Superintendent Fairbank'?

47:18.040 --> 47:20.042
This.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.207
Councillor Dale Roach
with guess who'?

47:25.960 --> 47:27.962
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.042
Roach and Fairbank.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.602
Roach and Fairbank.

47:39.880 --> 47:43.009
Chief Superintendent Fairbank
retired in 2008.

47:43.040 --> 47:45.566
Oh, yeah,
Pat ran Vice for donkeys' years.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.683
If Oliver Stephens-Lloyd
did submit a list of abusers

47:48.720 --> 47:51.849
at Sands View, almost certainly
it would've gone to Vice.

47:52.680 --> 47:54.682
Almost certainly.

47:54.720 --> 47:57.041
Which makes the fact
he was copied in on these

47:57.080 --> 48:00.050
missing persons and PM reports
all the more suspicious.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.207
Sir, former
Chief Superintendent Fairbank

48:06.240 --> 48:07.730
still lives in the area.

48:16.720 --> 48:19.451
Well, let's see what he's got
to say for himself.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.482
Good work, you two. Good work.

48:21.520 --> 48:23.522
- Sir.
- Sir.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.402
Come in, please.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.522
We' re very grateful
for your time, sir.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.562
Anything I can do to help.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.285
And...l'm retired now.
There's no need for the "sir".

48:41.320 --> 48:43.322
Follow me.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.362
(Clock ticking)

48:46.400 --> 48:48.402
- Take a seat.
- I'm DS...

48:48.440 --> 48:50.363
Tea or coffee'?

48:50.400 --> 48:53.290
We're fine, thank you, sir.
As I was saying, I'm DS Arnott.

48:53.320 --> 48:54.810
DC Fleming.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.281
Mr Fairbank, we'd like
to begin by asking you

48:59.320 --> 49:02.130
about a social worker who
went missing in October, '98.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.162
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.969
Doesn't ring a bell.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.241
Perhaps this report
might jog your memory'?

49:13.480 --> 49:15.482
Blind as a bat without these.

49:16.280 --> 49:18.567
Are you sure
you don't want a tea or coffee'?

49:18.600 --> 49:20.602
We're fine, thank you, sir.

49:35.600 --> 49:36.965
Sorry.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.002
The report was copied to you.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.486
Is there any reason
you might take an interest?

49:41.520 --> 49:43.170
None at all.

49:43.200 --> 49:46.010
Can you explain why
you've been sent this report'?

49:46.040 --> 49:48.486
Well,
I don't remember any of this.

49:48.520 --> 49:51.000
I mean, you're going back
a good many years.

49:51.840 --> 49:54.764
We'd like to show you some
newspaper clippings, if we may.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.450
(Clock chimes)

50:09.560 --> 50:12.484
You appear to be quite close
to Councillor Dale Roach.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.763
Our paths crossed occasionally.
Usually at a charity event.

50:19.040 --> 50:20.769
We weren't close.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.768
We're looking into allegations

50:22.800 --> 50:26.202
of child sexual exploitation
involving Councillor Roach.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.721
As head of Vice,
did you ever deal with

50:30.760 --> 50:33.047
any complaints against Roach?

50:33.880 --> 50:36.087
There may have been
some such saying

50:36.120 --> 50:39.966
"Councillor Roach has done this"
or "Councillor Roach did that".

50:40.000 --> 50:42.241
And what would it be
that the Councillor "did"?

50:42.280 --> 50:44.282
I don't recall the details.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.129
But when these things came up,

50:46.160 --> 50:47.844
they would have been
looked into.

50:47.880 --> 50:49.848
Did you ever deal with
complaints of abuse

50:49.880 --> 50:51.530
at Sands View Boys' Home'?

50:52.560 --> 50:54.130
That doesn't ring a bell.

50:54.160 --> 50:57.050
There was a specific allegation
made by the social worker,

50:57.080 --> 50:59.082
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.929
Sorry.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.361
Stephens-Lloyd claimed
he compiled

51:03.400 --> 51:06.051
a list of authority figures,
who, with staff collusion,

51:06.080 --> 51:09.289
conducted systematic abuse
of boys resident at Sands View.

51:09.320 --> 51:12.529
See, I've never even heard of
this "Stands View" place.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.085
(Doorbell)

51:14.120 --> 51:15.485
Sorry.

51:15.520 --> 51:18.763
- I'll get that, love.
WOMAN: OK.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.402
Here he is.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.561
I hope I'm not too late.

51:25.600 --> 51:28.001
Spot on.
How are you keeping, Ted'?

51:28.040 --> 51:30.407
Can't complain.
Can't complain.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.202
I hope
you don't mind me calling you'?

51:34.240 --> 51:36.846
Not at all, sir. A matter
of professional courtesy.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.002
As you were. As you were.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.207
Oh, now,
you'll stay after, won't you?

51:46.240 --> 51:48.322
Joyce will kill me
if I let you off the hook

51:48.360 --> 51:50.362
from her Victoria sponge.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.085
Ha-ha. That's very kind of you,
sir. Thank you.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.205
Don't mind me.

51:57.240 --> 51:59.481
FAIRBANK: Now, where were we'?

51:59.520 --> 52:01.921
(Music on radio)

52:01.960 --> 52:03.962
(Music stops)

52:25.240 --> 52:27.129
Where's Hastings?

52:27.160 --> 52:28.969
Briefing.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.128
Inspectors and above only.

52:31.880 --> 52:33.484
Kate...

52:40.040 --> 52:42.930
What the hell was that, Hastings
showing up at Fairbanks'?

52:42.960 --> 52:46.282
You heard Fairbank. He called
him, put the gaffer on the spot.

52:46.320 --> 52:48.641
Yeah, well, I saw
the handshake at the deer.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.124
It was Masonic.

52:53.600 --> 52:56.570
And that file on Ronan Murphy.
Murphy's connection to Hunter

52:56.600 --> 52:58.841
must have been concealed
by police officers.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.564
And who gave us that file'?

53:02.000 --> 53:03.923
Hastings.

53:13.640 --> 53:16.530
"The Caddy" is the codename
for a serving police officer

53:16.560 --> 53:18.801
with lifelong links
to organised crime

53:18.840 --> 53:21.127
working as a fixer
within the police service

53:21.160 --> 53:23.003
for certain criminal interests.

53:23.040 --> 53:26.487
No officer has ever been
irrefutably identified

53:26.520 --> 53:30.286
as the Caddy,
hence his existence is putative.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.761
The term was first heard
in a video statement

53:34.800 --> 53:36.609
made by John Thomas Hunter.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.049
DC Jeremy Cole, deceased.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.082
Now,
Cole was originally presumed,

53:43.120 --> 53:45.851
on the balance of probabilities,
to be the Caddy

53:45.880 --> 53:48.565
but that conclusion
is no longer supportable.

53:51.520 --> 53:55.923
PC Harinderpal Bains,
a corrupt AFO.

53:55.960 --> 53:57.803
His statements of evidence

53:57.840 --> 54:01.322
have led to the most accurate
profile yet of this individual.

54:02.160 --> 54:04.208
The Caddy is male.

54:04.240 --> 54:07.005
Given his lifelong links
to organised crime,

54:07.040 --> 54:10.601
the Caddy is almost certainly
from a working-class background

54:10.640 --> 54:12.722
and grew up
in an urban environment.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.048
Given the history
of his activities,

54:16.080 --> 54:19.880
starting from some time
between 2005 to 2010,

54:19.920 --> 54:22.651
according to the video statement
by Tommy Hunter,

54:22.680 --> 54:25.524
the Caddy is probably under 35.

54:26.760 --> 54:29.445
Given his access
to confidential information

54:29.480 --> 54:31.721
regarding ongoing operations,

54:31.760 --> 54:34.525
the Caddy
is almost certainly a detective.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.050
His ability
to manage communications

54:38.080 --> 54:40.367
without ever betraying
his own identity

54:40.400 --> 54:43.722
implies a highly trained, highly
sophisticated approach

54:43.760 --> 54:46.081
to covert operations
that is associated

54:46.120 --> 54:48.566
with Counter-Terrorism.

54:48.600 --> 54:51.729
And, lastly, Bains describes
the Caddy's voice

54:51.760 --> 54:55.765
as having a London
or Southeast accent.

54:57.760 --> 54:59.967
There's your bullet points.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.167
All right, everybody.
Let's leave it there.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.883
Thank you.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.002
Of course...
this is only a profile.

55:26.040 --> 55:28.771
There's lots of people
this description could fit.

55:28.800 --> 55:31.246
But only the Caddy
could have got his hands on

55:31.280 --> 55:34.682
Lindsay Demon's bribe money
from the right forensic source.

55:34.720 --> 55:37.041
I'm sorry, gaffer,
but the fingers pointing

55:37.080 --> 55:39.082
at one of our own.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.882
(Car door slams)

56:33.560 --> 56:35.324
All right'?

56:35.360 --> 56:37.362
All right.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.770
SIM card'?

56:44.800 --> 56:46.529
It's all in there.

56:55.840 --> 56:57.842
I don't know what to say.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.002
That it, then'?

57:14.720 --> 57:16.529
Yeah.
