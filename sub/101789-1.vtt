00:42.593 --> 00:43.627
Once upon a time,

00:45.627 --> 00:47.994
a very wealthy man had
the great misfortune

00:48.027 --> 00:49.692
to fall out of a plane.

00:54.060 --> 00:55.526
As he fell,

00:56.759 --> 01:00.659
the wind stripped him
off his designer suit,

01:01.393 --> 01:05.759
his Italian patent
shoes, crocodile wallet,

01:05.792 --> 01:08.692
gold watch, everything.

01:12.659 --> 01:15.659
And when he eventually
hit the Earth he was

01:16.726 --> 01:17.994
all but naked.

01:20.759 --> 01:21.792
The strange thing was

01:23.227 --> 01:25.493
when they found his broken body

01:27.460 --> 01:28.460
he was smiling,

01:30.759 --> 01:32.894
but that never made
any sense to me.

01:59.227 --> 02:02.027
Hey that's me done,
I'm out of here.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.094
You've only got
yourself to blame.

02:03.127 --> 02:04.793
Look at this,

02:04.827 --> 02:09.160
look at it; phone, gas,
electric, all final demands.

02:10.193 --> 02:11.759
They're taking the telly back,

02:11.793 --> 02:12.827
'cause we haven't paid him.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.793
You know Oprah was
my only salvation.

02:16.460 --> 02:19.094
All these years, all
these years I've wasted

02:19.127 --> 02:21.426
on mediocrity and look
where it's got me.

02:21.460 --> 02:22.692
What's it got me, aye?

02:22.726 --> 02:23.760
I haven't even got
a pot to piss in.

02:23.793 --> 02:25.526
Yeah, I know how that feels.

02:26.692 --> 02:28.692
Yeah well, that's
about to change.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.094
I've met someone else.

02:35.127 --> 02:35.960
What?

02:37.127 --> 02:39.060
Someone who can take
proper care of me.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.827
Just say something to me.

02:45.726 --> 02:47.393
What do you want me to say?

02:49.659 --> 02:51.659
I mean anything.

02:51.692 --> 02:53.692
I mean that dress is
a bit short, isn't it?

02:59.626 --> 03:00.626
Don't do that.

03:04.692 --> 03:06.559
Here you go.

03:06.592 --> 03:07.827
There you go.

03:07.860 --> 03:08.692
Get yourself down
the pawn shop, aye,

03:08.727 --> 03:10.860
go and buy yourself
a consolation beer,

03:10.894 --> 03:13.127
or better still get
yourself a new suit, aye.

03:14.592 --> 03:15.426
Nice.

03:17.127 --> 03:19.460
What was I thinking
an insurance salesman.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.960
- I'm a loss adjuster, Angie.
- Aye, yeah.

03:23.127 --> 03:24.827
Well, deal with this loss,

03:24.860 --> 03:26.760
and I won't be needing
these anymore either.

03:41.793 --> 03:43.060
Someone in
North London can get

03:43.094 --> 03:44.894
to claim the winning
lottery ticket.

03:51.727 --> 03:53.760
What are you looking
at you old bint?

04:12.894 --> 04:14.994
Martin, open the damn door.

04:31.194 --> 04:32.559
Please Martin.

04:33.592 --> 04:34.860
Angie, Angie.

04:37.927 --> 04:40.525
Hey, I got you Angie,
Angie, I can't let you...

04:40.559 --> 04:41.693
- Martin.
- It's me.

04:43.693 --> 04:44.827
It's still me, Angie.

05:07.027 --> 05:07.994
Oh, damn it.

05:29.693 --> 05:30.793
Hello Polly.

05:30.827 --> 05:31.927
Hello, Mr. Dyer.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.860
You're hard to get
hold of this morning.

05:33.894 --> 05:35.727
I hope you aren't
avoiding me.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.060
Anyway, I've got you
now and it's a busy day

05:38.094 --> 05:40.492
- ahead for you.
- There's no need.

05:40.525 --> 05:42.127
Polly, I'm sorry, I don't
think I can do this...

05:42.160 --> 05:45.894
One moment, I've got multiple
calls coming through.

05:45.927 --> 05:48.160
Good morning, Glipton
Millgrove, Polly speaking,

05:48.194 --> 05:50.827
could you hold the line, please?

05:50.860 --> 05:51.760
Sorry about that.

05:51.793 --> 05:53.960
Right, so your first
appointment is scheduled

05:53.994 --> 05:55.492
with Mrs. Rogerton-Sykes.

05:55.525 --> 05:57.860
She's at 9:15.

05:57.894 --> 06:00.459
Quite close to actually,
Highgate, a burglary.

06:00.492 --> 06:01.593
Nice and simple.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.927
Police verified everything,

06:02.960 --> 06:05.425
but she's since added
a few more items.

06:05.459 --> 06:06.827
No, no, but...

06:06.860 --> 06:09.827
Next up is Mr.
Gimpole in Totteridge.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.960
Someone has chopped down
his prize rhododendrons

06:12.994 --> 06:14.160
that he was planning to enter

06:14.194 --> 06:16.927
into the Chelsea
Flower Show next year,

06:16.960 --> 06:20.060
so you'll need to establish
the size of the plants

06:20.094 --> 06:22.593
before we can entertain
the size of the claims,

06:22.627 --> 06:25.492
bit tricky that one but
I'm sure you'll manage.

06:25.526 --> 06:29.627
And next, Mr. And Mrs.
Smallwood in Finchley,

06:29.660 --> 06:33.425
a house fire claiming for
absolutely everything, so...

06:34.194 --> 06:35.827
- Polly stop.
- No wait,

06:35.860 --> 06:37.660
forget the Smallwoods.

06:37.693 --> 06:40.827
Fire Service's haven't
filled their report yet.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.760
- Oh and your favorite,
- Polly stop.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.927
dear old Dr. Wicksteed.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.560
Can you believe the lodges
flooded the bathroom

06:47.593 --> 06:50.094
through the ceiling again?

06:50.127 --> 06:53.526
Polly, my wife left
me today.

06:54.727 --> 06:56.593
Oh, and he's absolutely adamant

06:56.627 --> 06:58.894
that he won't see anyone
else apart from you.

06:58.927 --> 07:00.860
I mean, it's not
surprising really,

07:00.894 --> 07:04.160
you don't get voted the company's
number one loss adjuster

07:04.194 --> 07:06.927
three years running
without being the best.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.194
Oh yes, okay, okay, just
e-mail the details to me,

07:10.227 --> 07:11.127
and I'll...

07:11.160 --> 07:12.727
Yeah, I already done, Mr. Dyer,

07:12.760 --> 07:14.027
I sent you last night.

07:15.459 --> 07:16.960
You have a lovely
day and be sure

07:16.994 --> 07:18.960
to give my best to
Mrs. Dyer, okay?

07:20.560 --> 07:23.960
Yes, I'll be sure
to tell her, bye, bye.

08:07.927 --> 08:08.727
Excuse me.

08:09.793 --> 08:10.727
Excuse me.

08:10.760 --> 08:11.593
Excuse me.

08:12.460 --> 08:13.994
I just got here.

08:17.027 --> 08:18.860
Well, happy Christmas.

08:26.827 --> 08:29.193
It would have been
cheaper to stay in bed.

09:09.027 --> 09:10.060
Yes.

09:10.094 --> 09:12.827
Yes, hello, this is Mr. Dyer
for Mrs. Rogerton-Sykes.

09:12.860 --> 09:14.060
Enter.

09:32.493 --> 09:34.159
Okay, let's do this.

09:52.060 --> 09:53.727
Hello there, Mrs.
Rogerton-Sykes.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.193
Mr. Dyer, you are late.

09:56.226 --> 09:57.560
Yes, I know the
traffic was very...

09:57.593 --> 10:00.159
Yes, the traffic usually is

10:00.193 --> 10:02.093
that's entirely predictable

10:02.126 --> 10:03.526
and should be planned
for, don't you think?

10:03.560 --> 10:06.060
Yes, absolutely, I apologize.

10:06.960 --> 10:07.994
You have a lovely home.

10:08.027 --> 10:09.027
This way.

10:15.159 --> 10:16.059
Do you take tea?

10:17.627 --> 10:21.027
I have Lapsang
Souchong or Earl grey?

10:21.059 --> 10:24.093
Oh, that's lovely, maybe
a coffee would be nice.

10:24.126 --> 10:25.560
Coffee?

10:25.593 --> 10:27.894
I'm afraid
we don't take coffee.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.426
Not to worry then.

10:30.126 --> 10:31.927
Shall we get on with it?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.860
Okay, yes, of course.

10:47.193 --> 10:49.693
So Mrs. Rogerton-Sykes I see,

10:51.093 --> 10:54.660
in addition to the items
listed in your police report,

10:54.693 --> 10:59.660
I see that you've noted a
few extra missing items.

11:01.026 --> 11:03.593
Missing, are you suggesting
they might actually

11:03.627 --> 11:05.059
not be missing?

11:05.093 --> 11:06.560
Oh my goodness, no, I wouldn't,

11:06.593 --> 11:08.493
Mr. Dyer, do I look like I need

11:08.526 --> 11:11.059
to defraud an insurance claim?

11:11.093 --> 11:12.860
No, no but you...

11:12.894 --> 11:17.059
Mr. Dyer, this has been
the most terrible shock,

11:17.093 --> 11:18.994
an absolute violation.

11:19.894 --> 11:22.627
I think that I listed
everything correctly,

11:22.660 --> 11:25.860
but in my distressed
state maybe I,

11:25.894 --> 11:28.093
it was obviously an oversight.

11:28.126 --> 11:29.827
I am the victim after all.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.193
Of course, you are.

11:31.227 --> 11:32.993
This is really just a formality,

11:33.026 --> 11:35.193
and these are question I
have to ask unfortunately.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.593
I should have insured
with Legal and General.

11:37.627 --> 11:40.093
My late husband always
said that we should.

11:40.126 --> 11:41.927
As usual, he was right.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.827
He was a sanctimonious bastard.

11:44.860 --> 11:47.627
They wouldn't have treated
me like a fraudster.

11:48.760 --> 11:49.827
I'm so sorry for your loss,

11:49.860 --> 11:51.026
I really am.

11:51.059 --> 11:52.660
Was it recent?

11:52.693 --> 11:53.793
Not that long ago.

11:55.126 --> 11:56.093
If I didn't know any better,

11:56.126 --> 11:57.993
I would have thought he
planned the whole thing,

11:58.026 --> 12:00.927
and now he just leaves
me alone in my prime.

12:02.059 --> 12:03.660
Well, no and of
course, I doubt that,

12:03.693 --> 12:05.593
I mean you know
a charming figure

12:05.627 --> 12:07.894
of a woman like you.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.760
Oh, you really think so?

12:12.959 --> 12:14.860
Have you experienced
loss, Mr. Dyer?

12:17.059 --> 12:18.860
Well, actually I
have, very recently,

12:18.894 --> 12:21.493
well, this morning,
my wife she left me.

12:21.526 --> 12:25.126
Oh, no, oh, what
a terrible shock,

12:25.160 --> 12:26.493
and right before Christmas,

12:26.526 --> 12:28.526
oh, you must be in pieces.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.126
Let me get you a whiskey.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.926
Oh no, thank you.

12:33.894 --> 12:35.627
I'm driving and everything.

12:37.693 --> 12:38.526
Come.

12:39.894 --> 12:40.993
Really, okay.

12:46.827 --> 12:48.026
Did you love her madly?

12:52.227 --> 12:53.426
Yes, I suppose I did.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.160
Well, of course you did,

12:56.593 --> 13:01.393
and so here we both are
lonely, abandoned, lost.

13:03.093 --> 13:05.860
There's only one cure
for a fall, Martin.

13:05.893 --> 13:06.893
Can I call you Martin?

13:06.926 --> 13:08.160
Yes off course, please do.

13:08.194 --> 13:10.460
Get back on the horse.

13:12.793 --> 13:17.793
You know, my husband
wasn't a very tactile man,

13:18.926 --> 13:20.526
and he always made
me feel lonely

13:20.560 --> 13:22.627
even when we were married.

13:22.660 --> 13:24.593
How do you mean?

13:24.627 --> 13:28.127
He never made me feel
like a real woman.

13:29.493 --> 13:32.526
I'm sure you are
extremely special

13:32.560 --> 13:34.959
to your husband, Mrs. Rogers.

13:34.993 --> 13:37.660
- Please call me Margaret.
- Okay, Margaret, okay.

13:38.593 --> 13:40.426
Yes, well, Margaret,

13:43.493 --> 13:44.926
I believe we can approve all

13:44.959 --> 13:47.926
of the missing
items on your list,

13:47.959 --> 13:49.560
and I really think
there's no need

13:49.593 --> 13:51.893
to make you suffer any
more than you already have.

13:51.926 --> 13:54.426
I think it's a very unfortunate
burglary if I'm honest.

13:54.460 --> 13:58.160
Oh, I don't mind going through
the details again with you,

13:58.194 --> 13:58.993
- It does.
- I really don't,

13:59.026 --> 14:01.893
and if you like I
can find some coffee

14:01.926 --> 14:03.127
for you in one of the cupboards.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.959
I'm sure the cooks
left something there.

14:05.993 --> 14:08.194
You've gone to so much trouble
for me today, really...

14:08.227 --> 14:12.460
Thank you, Martin,
you're so kind.

14:12.493 --> 14:13.760
They said you were.

14:13.793 --> 14:15.460
They did?

14:15.493 --> 14:18.426
Yes, they said that you're
kind, and compassionate,

14:18.460 --> 14:20.660
and that you only
cared for others.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.426
Well, thank you, Margaret.

14:23.127 --> 14:24.627
I do try my best.

14:25.693 --> 14:29.959
You know, Martin, it's only
when you've lost everything

14:29.993 --> 14:32.959
that you realize what
you're really missing.

14:34.993 --> 14:37.593
Well, what about you
stay for a spot of lunch,

14:37.627 --> 14:40.760
I could get a cook
to do some oysters?

14:40.793 --> 14:42.560
I'm sure you know about
oysters don't you...

14:42.593 --> 14:46.693
Yes, yes, of course, it is
a lovely offer, Margaret.

14:46.727 --> 14:48.760
I really do have to
get going though.

14:48.792 --> 14:50.426
It's getting late.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.127
Well, another time then.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.826
Maybe we could go shopping.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.060
Shopping?

14:55.094 --> 14:58.693
Yes, you could
accompany me to the Ivy,

14:58.727 --> 15:00.859
after I bought you a new suit

15:00.893 --> 15:02.926
just a little
Christmas gift from me.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.627
Just the coffee actually.

15:04.660 --> 15:05.859
Oh, that's okay.

15:05.893 --> 15:07.792
Look, I realize
you're very busy,

15:07.826 --> 15:10.127
but I really would like it.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.227
Yes.

15:11.261 --> 15:15.060
And I really would like if
you could call me sometime.

15:15.094 --> 15:16.460
- Yes of course.
- Would you?

15:16.493 --> 15:17.526
Yes.

15:18.593 --> 15:19.426
Martin?

15:20.859 --> 15:23.060
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, Merry Christmas.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.460
That's the European way.

15:30.493 --> 15:31.526
It's very charming.

15:32.493 --> 15:33.593
Thank you, Margaret.

15:33.627 --> 15:34.560
Thank you, thank you, Margaret.

15:34.593 --> 15:35.792
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.627
Mr. Dyer, Ms. Rogerton-Sykes has

16:03.660 --> 16:05.094
just been on the phone,

16:05.127 --> 16:06.526
only there's a few
items she forgot about,

16:06.560 --> 16:09.493
and wondered if you
could pop back later.

16:09.526 --> 16:11.060
No, it's okay.

16:11.094 --> 16:13.627
Polly it's okay, whatever
she puts on the list please

16:13.660 --> 16:15.426
just approve it, it's okay.

16:16.627 --> 16:17.593
Okay, for sure.

16:19.526 --> 16:20.627
I'm more than okay.

16:20.660 --> 16:21.893
No need for me to go back again.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.726
Right okay, bye, bye, bye.

16:31.826 --> 16:33.493
Goodness me.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.692
I'm staying here
with the two of these...

16:34.726 --> 16:36.927
Martin, Martin, my name.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.560
Mr. Dyer, Mr. Dyer,
Mr. Dyer, goodness me.

16:40.593 --> 16:42.094
So the news
my local news is

16:42.127 --> 16:44.526
that somebody near me has
won the lottery ticket,

16:44.560 --> 16:46.759
so if you live in
Highgate or Totteridge,

16:46.792 --> 16:49.460
please check your tickets.

16:49.493 --> 16:50.894
Tell me Nicodema
did you check yours?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.027
[Woman[ I didn't even
enter It, Donnie.

16:54.894 --> 16:58.593
Polly, could I, actually I
need to ask you a question.

16:58.627 --> 16:59.792
Yes, Mr. Dyer?

16:59.826 --> 17:01.894
Actually not a work
related question.

17:04.627 --> 17:07.726
Do you think there's
something wrong with my suit?

17:12.759 --> 17:13.627
Polly?

17:13.659 --> 17:16.593
Sorry, I have another
call, I have to go.

17:23.627 --> 17:24.659
What?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.626
You tosser!

18:04.194 --> 18:05.894
How about this one?

18:05.927 --> 18:07.894
Oh, I like that.

18:07.927 --> 18:08.894
It's lovely, thank you.

18:08.927 --> 18:10.426
I think she will like this.

18:10.460 --> 18:11.692
She's a lucky lady.

18:12.493 --> 18:14.692
Well, I think I'm the
lucky one, actually.

18:15.792 --> 18:16.759
So how many?

18:18.027 --> 18:19.759
How many years have
you been married?

18:19.792 --> 18:22.726
Sorry five years.

18:22.759 --> 18:24.659
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:25.659 --> 18:26.659
Do you think she will like this?

18:26.692 --> 18:27.894
Well off course.

18:27.927 --> 18:29.626
All women love flowers.

18:31.726 --> 18:33.560
You know, it's lovely here.

18:33.592 --> 18:35.927
I can't imagine who'd
ever get bored of it.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.027
No, never.

18:41.827 --> 18:42.692
- Okay.
- Yes.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.927
Enter your pin, please.

18:59.759 --> 19:02.994
Oh, this changes,
it's a new card,

19:03.027 --> 19:04.460
I don't understand.

19:05.194 --> 19:06.592
Is it a joint account?

19:07.592 --> 19:09.760
Could your wife have a little
surprise for you perhaps?

19:12.726 --> 19:13.559
Yeah.

19:14.592 --> 19:15.426
Thank you.

19:17.726 --> 19:18.726
Mr. Dyer.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.994
Yeah, hello.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.760
Mr. Gimpole, nice
to see you today.

19:23.793 --> 19:24.592
Call me Gimp.

19:25.793 --> 19:26.592
Gimp.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.027
Everyone else does.

19:30.626 --> 19:31.726
Follow me, lad.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.559
Follow me.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.160
You know much about
flowers, do you Dyer?

19:40.194 --> 19:42.659
Well, not really, Mr. Gimp.

19:42.692 --> 19:45.492
It's a, oh, dear, but I do
know what a rose looks like.

19:45.525 --> 19:47.127
I thought as much
not that it matters,

19:47.160 --> 19:47.960
I'll show you what's happened,

19:47.994 --> 19:48.960
and you'll get an idea.

19:48.994 --> 19:50.160
Oh dear.

19:50.194 --> 19:52.960
Sorry, I thought you'd
be more prepared,

19:52.994 --> 19:55.492
otherwise, I had had a
found you some wellies.

19:56.927 --> 19:58.994
You see these specimens here.

19:59.027 --> 20:02.793
Oh yes, they're
very nice, Mr. Gimp.

20:02.827 --> 20:07.793
No Dyer, they are nothing
compared to my rhododendrons.

20:08.592 --> 20:11.693
The bastards knew I
would win of course.

20:11.727 --> 20:13.060
Bastards.

20:13.094 --> 20:15.894
Next May's Flower show, Dyer.

20:15.927 --> 20:19.626
They cut down what was
to be my prize exhibits.

20:20.894 --> 20:22.760
Well you don't know
what to say, Mr. Gimp.

20:22.793 --> 20:25.027
Well, there's nothing
you can say really.

20:25.060 --> 20:27.592
But I would imagine of course
that the priority here is

20:27.626 --> 20:29.994
to establish exactly what
these rhododendrons are worth

20:30.027 --> 20:31.492
to you, Mr. Gimp.

20:34.894 --> 20:36.659
Nothing that money can replace.

20:37.592 --> 20:38.860
Their beauty was priceless,

20:39.960 --> 20:44.060
the color, the shape,
the very touch.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.592
Can you zip me up darling?

20:55.727 --> 20:56.525
Okay.

21:02.693 --> 21:04.592
Why it's not just the
prestige, you know,

21:04.626 --> 21:06.760
the honour of
receiving an award.

21:06.793 --> 21:07.927
Of course Mr. Gimp.

21:09.793 --> 21:10.626
Dyer?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.660
These were a hybrid you see.

21:14.693 --> 21:18.559
A complete one off I'd the spent
years affecting the species

21:19.559 --> 21:21.194
A new species.

21:21.227 --> 21:25.927
Oh my, this must be
akin to losing a child.

21:28.592 --> 21:30.927
Wow, I guess it's similar.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.459
As in fact as you, you
feed it, you water it.

21:34.492 --> 21:35.927
You shower it with
love and attention.

21:35.960 --> 21:36.827
You cherish it.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.693
You protect it,

21:38.727 --> 21:40.693
and then some bastard
runs off with it.

21:42.194 --> 21:43.894
I know exactly what you mean.

21:45.660 --> 21:48.693
My God, you've lost a child.

21:48.727 --> 21:50.793
Oh no, Mr. Gimp,

21:50.827 --> 21:53.760
but somebody did nick my wife.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.894
Martin, Martin, thank you
so much for coming out.

22:36.927 --> 22:38.094
Do come in.

22:38.127 --> 22:39.593
Good to see you again.

22:39.627 --> 22:41.459
So good to see you.

22:41.492 --> 22:42.693
Come in.

22:42.727 --> 22:43.927
Oh, it's okay, you
have something.

22:43.960 --> 22:44.860
Oh, please let me
give it to you.

22:44.894 --> 22:46.660
That feels nothing important.

22:46.693 --> 22:48.793
Oh my goodness, thank
you, there we go.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.425
Come in, come in.

22:51.927 --> 22:53.027
Welcome, welcome.

22:55.727 --> 22:57.927
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry
to have ask this question,

22:57.960 --> 22:58.994
what's that awful smell?

22:59.027 --> 23:00.560
Yeah, a rat.

23:00.593 --> 23:01.827
A rat where?

23:01.860 --> 23:03.593
A dead one under there,

23:03.627 --> 23:06.094
judging from the
concentrated potency.

23:06.127 --> 23:07.627
Oh dear, have you called anyone?

23:07.660 --> 23:09.526
Environmental health.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.927
They can't get anyone
round till Monday,

23:11.960 --> 23:13.693
but this smell is intolerable,

23:13.727 --> 23:14.927
so I have to get the
little devil up myself.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.860
No, please Norman,
let me help you.

23:16.894 --> 23:19.027
- Wait.
- Well, look at this.

23:19.060 --> 23:22.560
- That's a non-invented cause.
- Yes.

23:22.593 --> 23:24.425
Okay, come on, let me help you.

23:24.459 --> 23:26.860
I'm gonna need a
flat head screwdriver

23:26.894 --> 23:27.994
and oh, a hammer if you have...

23:28.027 --> 23:29.960
I have the toolbox is there.

23:30.927 --> 23:32.994
Are you sure about this, Martin?

23:33.027 --> 23:34.693
Well, as long as he's dead.

23:34.727 --> 23:35.927
Yes.

23:35.960 --> 23:36.994
Also do you have
any plastic bags?

23:37.027 --> 23:38.927
Yes, yes, I do.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.860
The twins save them for me.

23:41.894 --> 23:44.127
It's part of their
green intentions,

23:44.160 --> 23:47.994
but they never remember
to reuse them.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.493
I have a drawer full.

23:52.793 --> 23:54.827
- Oh, thank you.
- Would you like a peg?

23:55.960 --> 23:56.793
I'm okay.

23:56.827 --> 23:58.793
Yeah, I think the
plastic bags are fine.

24:01.827 --> 24:03.994
Can I do anything to help?

24:04.027 --> 24:05.994
Oh, one of your lovely
coffees will be great.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.160
Right, I'm way ahead of you.

24:07.194 --> 24:08.760
The coffee is already made.

24:19.927 --> 24:20.860
- Careful.
- Thank you.

24:31.927 --> 24:33.425
- Have you found it?
- I think I have.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.060
Ah, let me see.

24:35.094 --> 24:36.493
Have a look.

24:36.526 --> 24:38.593
Right there, you see him?

24:41.094 --> 24:43.027
My goodness, look
at the size of it.

24:43.060 --> 24:44.994
It's a bit of a monster.

24:45.027 --> 24:46.526
Must be a sewer rat.

24:51.994 --> 24:52.793
Got him.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.894
Oh, well done, Martin.

24:57.927 --> 24:59.927
Oh thank you so much.

25:06.094 --> 25:07.027
Oh, thank you.

25:07.060 --> 25:08.994
Well, that's a nice bag.

25:10.460 --> 25:13.827
Ah shit, maybe I can
give this to the wife.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.660
- Aye?
- Nothing.

25:21.627 --> 25:23.094
Oh look, might have you have
turn those taps back off

25:23.127 --> 25:24.560
- I'd hope.
- No.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.760
How many times has it
been there, Norman?

25:28.793 --> 25:29.793
A fair few.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.526
I am sorry, Martin.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.827
I hadn't meant to
be a burden to you.

25:34.860 --> 25:36.994
Norman, please don't
say such a thing.

25:37.027 --> 25:38.127
I have to be honest with you

25:38.159 --> 25:39.127
if they didn't flood you out

25:39.159 --> 25:41.660
every few months I think
I might be disappointed.

25:41.693 --> 25:43.094
Really?

25:43.127 --> 25:45.426
Well, to be honest,
I kind of I would be

25:45.460 --> 25:47.727
with this old
friends you and me.

25:47.760 --> 25:51.860
You mean you don't go rat
catching for all your clients?

25:51.894 --> 25:53.894
Now come on let's straighten
out your living room,

25:53.927 --> 25:55.159
we've gotta sort your claim out.

26:07.526 --> 26:08.094
We got him.

26:08.126 --> 26:09.159
Oh, remove the thing.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.526
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

26:14.060 --> 26:15.027
Still stinks.

26:18.226 --> 26:19.027
Good coffee.

26:21.159 --> 26:25.426
So Martin, something's
troubling you.

26:30.827 --> 26:32.593
I'm here to look after you.

26:32.627 --> 26:37.027
Of course, but you are
troubled, I can tell.

26:44.660 --> 26:46.827
It's good to talk, you know.

26:46.860 --> 26:48.660
I used to tell that
to my patients.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.393
Did it help?

26:51.560 --> 26:52.460
Nah, not really.

26:53.927 --> 26:55.894
But I got a few extra
Christmas cards.

26:55.927 --> 26:57.027
Now there's a bonus.

26:58.793 --> 27:03.793
Life is short yet
we spend nearly all

27:04.894 --> 27:05.693
of our time pretending
that we're fine

27:05.727 --> 27:07.426
when we're anything but.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.027
It cannot have
escaped your attention

27:11.059 --> 27:15.793
that I'm of an age that
defies much more longevity.

27:17.159 --> 27:19.493
Stop that Norman you're
fighting fit and raring to go.

27:19.526 --> 27:20.760
Fighting fit,

27:23.159 --> 27:25.994
raring to go.

27:27.526 --> 27:30.526
Raring to go, I suppose I am.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.627
Norman, is everything okay?

27:36.026 --> 27:37.693
I never had children you know.

27:39.460 --> 27:42.593
I'm confused, what
about the twins?

27:42.627 --> 27:44.994
Oh, they're not mine.

27:45.026 --> 27:47.393
No, their mom was my patient.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.093
I've known them since
they were babies.

27:51.226 --> 27:52.593
They're very sweet.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.426
They do some shopping
and laundry for me.

28:03.193 --> 28:07.526
No, my late wife
couldn't conceive,

28:09.793 --> 28:13.426
and after she went
back in the '70s,

28:14.927 --> 28:18.593
I fell in love with the freedom

28:18.627 --> 28:20.827
that comes with
the bachelor life.

28:23.126 --> 28:24.693
Wow, '70s, huh?

28:26.126 --> 28:27.526
She must have been so young.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.727
Sorry, I know, she didn't die.

28:31.894 --> 28:33.493
No, she buggered it
off with the neighbor.

28:34.593 --> 28:36.693
Oh dear, it must be catching.

28:38.059 --> 28:41.793
Aha, so it's wife troubles.

28:45.059 --> 28:45.894
Yes.

28:48.727 --> 28:49.959
I'm sorry to share this,

28:49.993 --> 28:52.760
but my wife left me
this morning, Norman.

28:54.526 --> 28:55.126
Oh Martin,

28:59.227 --> 29:00.393
I'm so sorry.

29:01.827 --> 29:06.026
It's funny you know, it's
been a long time coming,

29:07.660 --> 29:10.460
and I'm sure I would
have seen the signs

29:10.493 --> 29:13.526
if I had just been looking.

29:26.727 --> 29:28.460
You do love me,
don't you, Aiden?

29:30.493 --> 29:31.460
Yes, my life.

29:32.526 --> 29:34.460
Why did you have
to go for so long?

29:36.493 --> 29:38.894
Glasgow is a long way, aye babe?

29:38.926 --> 29:41.426
24 hours traveling,
there and back

29:41.460 --> 29:43.593
plus two days to recuperate,

29:43.627 --> 29:45.460
that brings the month
down to 24 days,

29:45.493 --> 29:48.493
that's barely three weeks
to finish the legals,

29:48.526 --> 29:49.793
and I don't work weekends,

29:49.827 --> 29:51.959
so that's really only 15 days.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.160
After closing
joint bank accounts

29:56.194 --> 29:58.460
that would be at
least three days.

29:58.493 --> 29:59.526
Three?

30:00.460 --> 30:02.460
There's a process.

30:02.493 --> 30:04.760
Got to get appointments
with the managers

30:04.793 --> 30:06.593
which will give me 12 days.

30:07.793 --> 30:10.059
Then I have to pay off the joint
bills, terminate the leckie

30:10.094 --> 30:14.560
and gas accounts, another
two days, so 10 left.

30:14.593 --> 30:16.059
I can't go halfway
around the world

30:16.094 --> 30:18.426
without visiting mom and
dad for a couple of days.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.660
Then my sister and
she aint close.

30:20.693 --> 30:24.526
Do have you any idea
how how big Oz is?

30:24.560 --> 30:26.926
Two days driving there and back,

30:26.959 --> 30:28.660
plus a day with her at least,

30:29.859 --> 30:30.760
that'll give me...

30:33.560 --> 30:35.526
Five, five days left.

30:36.493 --> 30:41.493
Yeah, right, five days
in which to sell my car,

30:41.526 --> 30:44.993
pack up my life and move
the other side of the world.

30:45.026 --> 30:46.493
No biggie, right?

30:46.526 --> 30:49.593
Okay, just because I want
you back here with me

30:49.627 --> 30:52.194
as soon as possible that's all.

30:52.227 --> 30:54.460
Well, be patient.

30:54.493 --> 30:57.526
In a month, I'll be
free to be with you.

31:01.893 --> 31:02.859
I'm sorry.

31:04.194 --> 31:05.127
Okay, I understand all this,

31:05.160 --> 31:07.026
why don't you come back to bed.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.460
I have a pub to run.

31:09.627 --> 31:12.859
Well, can't Rob manage
by himself for once.

31:12.893 --> 31:14.460
Rob?

31:15.926 --> 31:17.094
He's only a bar man.

31:18.526 --> 31:19.959
Well, so how is he
gonna manage then

31:19.993 --> 31:21.660
when the landlord's away?

31:21.693 --> 31:23.127
Well, maybe he won't,

31:23.160 --> 31:25.926
and then I'll have no
business to come back to.

31:28.826 --> 31:30.160
Did you sort out the money?

31:31.493 --> 31:33.993
Yeah, I transferred
it yesterday.

31:34.027 --> 31:35.526
It should be in by Friday.

31:40.826 --> 31:42.493
It is gonna be enough isn't it?

31:42.526 --> 31:44.593
'Cause I'm not sure I can
get my hands on anymore.

31:44.627 --> 31:45.627
Yes, my love.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.593
Thank you.

31:55.759 --> 31:58.859
Oh, and babe, slip out
the back door, will you?

31:58.893 --> 32:00.759
We don't wanna attract
attention, aye.

32:04.660 --> 32:05.560
I'm so sorry.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.727
Where has she gone?

32:10.526 --> 32:11.493
I don't know, Norman.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.593
To be honest with you it
could be a number of men.

32:15.627 --> 32:16.460
I see.

32:17.792 --> 32:18.994
Money is the issue?

32:20.593 --> 32:23.526
I really
don't wanna bore you

32:23.560 --> 32:25.994
with my financial
difficulties, Norman,

32:27.627 --> 32:29.493
but my wife she
wants a better life.

32:30.826 --> 32:32.560
The life of Riley.

32:32.593 --> 32:35.393
I see and don't we all.

32:37.060 --> 32:41.593
But payback comes to Riley in
the end one way or another.

32:42.759 --> 32:43.660
What do you mean?

32:43.693 --> 32:45.693
What goes around comes around.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.660
Look at it positively.

32:49.693 --> 32:52.660
She can't nag about your suit,

32:52.693 --> 32:54.160
or tell you to shave your beard,

32:54.194 --> 32:56.127
or throw out your beer cans.

32:58.526 --> 33:03.027
The glass is always
half full, Martin.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.759
Being a single man
can be liberating.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.094
I've never been.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.927
You mentioned my suit.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.726
I was being
metaphorical, Martin.

33:16.493 --> 33:21.393
I think you are truly
rather remarkable.

33:23.094 --> 33:26.660
You really must learn
to appreciate the value

33:26.692 --> 33:28.393
of your virtues,

33:31.460 --> 33:33.826
but you're too modest by far

33:33.859 --> 33:36.692
which in itself is
another of your virtues.

33:37.627 --> 33:42.560
Martin, I wish I'd had a son,

33:46.759 --> 33:48.460
it's my greatest regret,

33:48.493 --> 33:52.593
but you have made
me realise that

33:53.792 --> 33:55.792
if I had had a son

33:57.994 --> 34:01.627
I would like him to
have been just like...

34:04.894 --> 34:05.692
Norman.

34:08.759 --> 34:09.759
Norman.

34:09.792 --> 34:11.094
Norman.

34:11.127 --> 34:12.027
Norman.

34:18.994 --> 34:20.159
- Hey.
- Hello.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.493
I'm friends with Norman.

34:22.525 --> 34:23.159
I can help.

34:36.659 --> 34:37.927
Who are you?

34:37.960 --> 34:40.759
Sorry, I know Norman.

34:40.792 --> 34:41.893
Oh, you know him.

34:41.927 --> 34:43.525
What is this?

34:43.560 --> 34:44.960
I'm here to help him clean up.

34:47.525 --> 34:48.960
Okay, yes come in.

34:53.493 --> 34:54.726
So, how can I help you?

34:55.860 --> 34:57.792
That's a nice tie.

34:57.827 --> 34:59.626
Excuse me, you can't
just barge in here.

34:59.659 --> 35:03.692
Oh that is a terrible
stink, is that the rat?

35:03.726 --> 35:04.860
Oh yes, it is actually.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.692
Hold on how do you
know about that?

35:07.726 --> 35:10.027
Oh no, please don't
touch him, he's not well.

35:10.060 --> 35:11.659
You can say that again.

35:12.659 --> 35:13.659
Is he okay?

35:13.692 --> 35:14.827
Of course, he's not okay.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.493
He's brown bread.

35:16.526 --> 35:17.393
Oh goodness me.

35:18.793 --> 35:20.793
This day is really turning
out to be the most awful day.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.793
Yeah, I don't think his is
turning out too great either.

35:23.827 --> 35:26.060
Excuse me, what are you doing?

35:26.094 --> 35:27.460
What?

35:27.493 --> 35:28.960
It's not like he needs
any more anymore.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.659
I think you shoved your
missus under the floorboards

35:30.692 --> 35:31.692
if I didn't know any better.

35:31.726 --> 35:32.793
What, wait what?

35:32.827 --> 35:33.994
Do you want another coffee?

35:34.027 --> 35:34.927
You look like you need it.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.094
Oh no, thank you, actually,

35:37.127 --> 35:38.659
I'd rather have
something stronger.

35:38.692 --> 35:39.927
It's good idea.

35:46.894 --> 35:47.726
Screw it.

36:00.094 --> 36:01.160
There you go, here.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.160
Would you.

36:05.194 --> 36:06.393
No thanks.

36:07.094 --> 36:08.460
But you said.

36:08.493 --> 36:10.860
I said it was good
idea but I don't drink.

36:12.960 --> 36:13.793
Poor Norman.

36:16.793 --> 36:19.426
All right, come on
mate get a grip.

36:19.460 --> 36:20.860
He's just another client to you.

36:20.894 --> 36:21.894
No, he's not.

36:23.592 --> 36:25.559
He's a lovely lovely old man.

36:25.592 --> 36:26.659
He was.

36:29.793 --> 36:33.127
Okay, fair enough he
was, and who you are you?

36:34.525 --> 36:36.659
You're not the bloody
tenant, are you?

36:36.692 --> 36:37.692
What?

36:37.727 --> 36:38.525
No.

36:38.559 --> 36:40.525
The bedsit's empty.

36:40.559 --> 36:41.793
I don't understand that
doesn't make sense,

36:41.827 --> 36:42.827
because I'm here
because of this,

36:42.860 --> 36:44.426
it just happened.

36:44.460 --> 36:46.094
I'm the loss adjuster.

36:46.127 --> 36:48.127
I know who you are,

36:48.160 --> 36:49.793
but the place is empty.

36:49.827 --> 36:52.693
Trust me, I know these things.

36:52.727 --> 36:53.727
I'm the hoover man.

36:55.094 --> 36:56.160
Hoover man, what does that mean?

36:56.194 --> 36:57.760
I keep the place clean.

36:59.227 --> 37:00.492
- You get me?
- No.

37:02.860 --> 37:03.793
Okay, ambulance.

37:03.827 --> 37:05.793
If you think that's wise.

37:05.827 --> 37:06.727
Why is that?

37:08.860 --> 37:09.793
Who is that?

37:09.827 --> 37:11.827
How the hell should I know.

37:11.860 --> 37:12.894
Go and see.

37:12.927 --> 37:13.727
Well, what about Norman?

37:13.760 --> 37:15.027
I'm sure he won't mind.

37:15.060 --> 37:17.626
I don't mean like that,
what do we say about him?

37:19.860 --> 37:21.127
It doesn't matter what
you say about him,

37:21.160 --> 37:22.894
because no one's ever
gonna know I was here,

37:22.927 --> 37:25.027
and I aint got prints all
over the gaff unlike some.

37:25.060 --> 37:27.727
What are you trying to suggest?

37:27.760 --> 37:29.027
Well, from the way I see it,

37:29.060 --> 37:31.425
you've came in, upended
his floorboards,

37:31.459 --> 37:32.559
moved his furniture around,

37:32.592 --> 37:35.592
and last thing I see you've
giving the old bloke a hug,

37:35.626 --> 37:39.660
now he's out and your
DNA is everywhere, mate.

37:39.693 --> 37:41.525
He just keeled over.

37:41.559 --> 37:42.760
From where I'm standing.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.127
it doesn't quite look like that.

37:45.459 --> 37:46.492
Steed honey,

37:47.660 --> 37:49.559
Mummy is here, you naughty boy.

37:50.592 --> 37:51.860
Your boy's got a tart.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.459
Shut up, shut up.

37:54.492 --> 37:56.492
Where are you?

37:57.627 --> 37:58.894
What do I say to her?

37:58.927 --> 38:00.627
Tell her he's sleeping,

38:00.660 --> 38:01.559
just get rid of her.

38:01.592 --> 38:02.793
- Sleeping?
- Yeah.

38:02.827 --> 38:03.827
Okay, that works.

38:03.860 --> 38:04.960
That's good stay here.

38:11.927 --> 38:12.559
Hello there

38:12.592 --> 38:15.127
- Hello there lover.
- Hello.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.127
He didn't say there'll
be three of us today.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.927
Three of us.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.793
- But I'm fine with three.
- All right, that's me.

38:21.827 --> 38:24.793
Especially if the third
one is as cute as you.

38:24.827 --> 38:25.960
Hello madam, you are?

38:27.860 --> 38:29.994
- I'm Purdy.
- Hello Purdy,

38:30.027 --> 38:31.927
and he's my steed.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.593
- Get it?
- Oh steed.

38:34.559 --> 38:37.127
Excuse me, madam, madam.

38:37.160 --> 38:40.860
Aw, my
baby is sleeping, aw.

38:45.094 --> 38:47.027
Oh, and he's not very warm.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.160
Poor darling.

38:50.660 --> 38:52.827
What in the hell's
name is that smell?

38:52.860 --> 38:55.425
Oh, it's a rat, it's a dead rat.

38:55.459 --> 38:56.960
Does it smell that bad upstairs?

38:58.593 --> 39:00.492
Well, I actually, I don't
think it does actually.

39:00.525 --> 39:01.827
Well thank the lord,

39:01.860 --> 39:03.492
'cause it doesn't
exactly whet my appetite

39:03.525 --> 39:04.927
if you know what I'm saying.

39:07.593 --> 39:08.927
Get my Steedy a blanket,

39:09.994 --> 39:12.927
and join me upstairs.

39:13.827 --> 39:16.793
Ms. Purdy, probably I
must tell you I'm, I'm...

39:17.860 --> 39:18.627
Shy honey.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.160
I honestly I'm a
little out of shape,

39:20.194 --> 39:21.927
but I'm just a loss adjuster.

39:22.660 --> 39:26.760
Role play, whatever
you want honey.

39:26.793 --> 39:27.960
Yowza!

39:33.860 --> 39:34.760
What was that?

39:34.793 --> 39:38.127
What that was Martin,
is the funniest thing

39:38.160 --> 39:39.693
I have ever seen.

39:39.727 --> 39:41.027
How do you know my name?

39:42.459 --> 39:43.593
Hey, you tell me who you are,

39:43.627 --> 39:44.960
and what you're
doing here right now?

39:44.994 --> 39:46.860
Yeah, all right,
keep your hair on.

39:48.994 --> 39:51.827
Oh dear, the smell
of that thing.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.960
Uncle Norman, it's
us, Georgia and Mimi.

40:16.793 --> 40:17.593
Who are you?

40:17.627 --> 40:18.960
Who are you?

40:18.994 --> 40:20.860
Oh, the twins.

40:20.894 --> 40:22.994
Oh, we asked first.

40:23.027 --> 40:25.994
Oh yes, yes, yes,
right, I am, I'm Martin.

40:26.027 --> 40:29.027
- Oh, you're Martin.
- Oh, you're Martin.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.027
Yes, yes.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.459
- You look awful.
- I do?

40:36.493 --> 40:37.160
Doesn't he Georgia?

40:37.194 --> 40:38.927
And he smells funny too.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.460
Well, actually I
don't really smell.

40:40.493 --> 40:41.127
It's something.

40:43.027 --> 40:44.793
And I'm sure you know
where everything is.

40:44.827 --> 40:45.693
What am I doing?

40:54.027 --> 40:57.894
You don't even think
about it, get back in.

41:03.994 --> 41:05.994
Oh, you again?

41:06.027 --> 41:07.894
Didn't your mama
teach you any manners?

41:07.927 --> 41:10.060
How about You try knocking?

41:10.094 --> 41:12.960
I think you do enough
knocking for all of us.

41:12.994 --> 41:15.127
That's very rude young lady.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.960
You can put them away
and then you can scram.

41:17.994 --> 41:20.627
I thought she only
came on Thursdays.

41:20.660 --> 41:22.760
And Mondays honey.

41:22.793 --> 41:24.960
Where's uncle Norman
he owes us 20 quid?

41:24.994 --> 41:27.860
For a service wash
that's robbery.

41:27.894 --> 41:30.894
Yeah well, not all of us
earn our money lying down.

41:30.927 --> 41:34.127
Some of us actually
graft for our money.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.894
Young lady, I never...

41:35.927 --> 41:37.060
Save it.

41:37.094 --> 41:39.927
We really don't wanna know.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.727
Our mom says you're
his strumpet.

41:45.360 --> 41:48.060
One thing, could you
find a new body lotion?

41:48.094 --> 41:50.060
It's a nightmare to
get off the sheets.

41:50.094 --> 41:50.927
Brats.

41:50.960 --> 41:51.960
- Tart.
- Tart.

41:59.627 --> 42:01.493
Oh, hello there, how are you?

42:01.526 --> 42:02.793
Uncle Norman owes us 20 quid,

42:02.827 --> 42:03.994
do you know where he is?

42:04.027 --> 42:05.627
He's actually
sleeping right now?

42:05.660 --> 42:06.860
Sleeping, where?

42:07.793 --> 42:09.693
Oh, he's the sofa just resting.

42:09.727 --> 42:10.860
Can you wake him up?

42:10.894 --> 42:13.426
He's got an aerobics session
with Holly Golightly upstairs,

42:13.460 --> 42:15.094
and she's getting cranky.

42:15.127 --> 42:17.159
Well, I'm sure, I mean, I
don't think he's gonna be up

42:17.193 --> 42:18.593
for that today if I'm honest

42:18.627 --> 42:20.127
but you know what? I can
pay you the 20 pounds.

42:20.159 --> 42:22.526
Oh, that's 20 each.

42:23.760 --> 42:24.526
- Each?
- Yeah.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.593
One second.

42:28.159 --> 42:29.159
Here you go.

42:31.526 --> 42:32.927
Oh, what is at stink?

42:32.960 --> 42:36.460
You see it's not me actually,
it's a rat a dead one.

42:36.493 --> 42:38.526
Oh woozy bad.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.526
Let me see.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.727
- Where is it?
- Here you go.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.827
No, you really don't
want to see it.

42:41.860 --> 42:42.760
It's dead and it's in the bag.

42:42.793 --> 42:43.994
It's horrible.

42:44.027 --> 42:47.560
You touched it,
bloody disgusting.

42:47.593 --> 42:49.126
Just like your
language young lady,

42:49.159 --> 42:50.960
and in front of Norman.

42:50.994 --> 42:52.426
I thought he was sleeping.

42:52.460 --> 42:53.660
Well, yes, he is sleeping.

42:53.693 --> 42:54.593
Well, he can't hear
us then can he?

42:54.627 --> 42:56.460
Yes, have a lovely day goodbye.

42:57.526 --> 43:00.093
- Sucker.
- One born every minute.

43:01.226 --> 43:02.994
Thanks, say
hi to uncle Norman

43:03.027 --> 43:04.093
when he wakes up.

43:04.126 --> 43:05.927
Little terrors.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.927
Okay, I need to get going.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.126
You're not going anyway
not until you explain

43:10.159 --> 43:11.060
to me what's going on here?

43:11.093 --> 43:13.860
I'll tell you just stop
gripping my Ralphie.

43:15.159 --> 43:16.126
Your what?

43:16.159 --> 43:18.159
My hoodie, it's Ralph Lauren.

43:18.193 --> 43:19.393
I like nice clothes.

43:22.193 --> 43:24.660
It looks pretty expensive
for a kid like you.

43:24.693 --> 43:25.793
Perks of the job.

43:26.927 --> 43:29.027
Oh yes, that's
right a hoover man.

43:29.060 --> 43:30.660
So how do you know me?

43:30.693 --> 43:32.660
You know more importantly
how do they know me?

43:35.793 --> 43:38.960
Well, Norman was
pretty fond of you.

43:42.760 --> 43:47.593
It's probably how they know
you, me, I know your Angie.

43:49.059 --> 43:51.027
I never actually met you though.

43:51.059 --> 43:52.426
What did you say?

43:53.226 --> 43:55.994
Angie, you mean my wife, Angie?

43:56.027 --> 43:59.093
Yeah, she's shacked
up with my dad now.

44:01.727 --> 44:03.159
You really aint got a clue, huh?

44:07.093 --> 44:08.059
No, I don't,

44:09.693 --> 44:12.593
but it might have something
to do with the fact

44:12.627 --> 44:14.827
of the day I had
before I even got here,

44:18.460 --> 44:20.361
and I lost a very
dear friend today.

44:21.693 --> 44:25.026
On top of that, I just
found out that my wife,

44:26.860 --> 44:30.026
my wife is playing
housie with your old man.

44:30.059 --> 44:31.526
Do you really think I don't know

44:31.560 --> 44:33.426
that this suit might not
be the height of fashion?

44:34.860 --> 44:36.059
Time is money honey.

44:37.693 --> 44:39.793
What's taking you boys so long.

44:46.026 --> 44:47.026
It's truth time.

44:49.693 --> 44:50.593
What is your name?

44:52.960 --> 44:53.760
Sam.

44:55.460 --> 44:59.760
Okay Sam, start talking.

45:01.059 --> 45:03.193
Okay, do you remember

45:03.227 --> 45:08.393
when Angie ran up those
massive credit card bills?

45:21.126 --> 45:21.959
Are you okay, babe.

45:25.026 --> 45:25.860
Am I?

45:27.660 --> 45:29.993
I'm just worried that you,

45:31.460 --> 45:33.159
I don't understand Angie
it's a brand new card.

45:33.194 --> 45:36.126
I'm confused how can we
be maxed out already?

45:38.026 --> 45:40.959
Just months on months
and I didn't realise.

45:43.194 --> 45:45.727
It's five.

45:50.194 --> 45:51.860
Look, I'm sorry.

45:51.894 --> 45:54.560
Just a, you know, it
adds up sometimes.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.526
You need another one?

45:59.160 --> 46:00.460
Hey, Rob.

46:03.093 --> 46:03.993
Rob?

46:04.026 --> 46:05.093
Hey, give us a minute, I'm busy.

46:05.126 --> 46:06.793
All right, another for Angie
and when you get a second

46:06.827 --> 46:08.460
a pint for me, thanks.

46:11.126 --> 46:12.627
Where this other guy?

46:12.660 --> 46:15.059
Hey, Rob, what's the name
of the guy that works here?

46:15.093 --> 46:15.926
Aiden.

46:16.793 --> 46:18.093
That's his name isn't it?

46:18.127 --> 46:19.093
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:19.959 --> 46:20.993
Guys back in Australia, man.

46:21.026 --> 46:23.160
Australia what's he doing there?

46:23.194 --> 46:24.593
He got deported.

46:27.059 --> 46:28.127
He's visa ran out.

46:29.493 --> 46:30.793
It's good riddance to him I say,

46:31.727 --> 46:33.460
lazy flipping jiggalo.

46:33.493 --> 46:35.959
I've got it, its
all right darlin'.

46:35.993 --> 46:37.893
Sweetheart, are you okay?

46:37.926 --> 46:39.460
- Yeah.
- Do you feel all right?

46:39.493 --> 46:40.627
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Yeah?

46:49.593 --> 46:52.160
He said he loved me, bastard.

46:53.460 --> 46:55.727
Oh darling, what bastard?

46:57.593 --> 46:59.727
He promised me we'd set
up home to get there,

46:59.760 --> 47:00.993
he told me he owned the place.

47:02.593 --> 47:05.893
Set up home?
really, the bastard.

47:07.793 --> 47:08.993
He lied to me, Angie,.

47:09.026 --> 47:10.127
He was never coming back.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.993
He was only the bloody barman.

47:13.959 --> 47:17.460
Never, bloody bastard.

47:19.560 --> 47:20.993
He stole 10 grand from me.

47:22.526 --> 47:23.560
10?

47:24.660 --> 47:27.426
Absolute bastards, all of them!

47:28.227 --> 47:30.660
I just don't know how
I'm gonna replace it.

47:31.959 --> 47:33.560
I maxed out on all
my other credit card.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.194
Babe, what?

47:37.227 --> 47:39.460
Just how many cards do you have?

47:44.127 --> 47:46.693
Oh, you need help.

47:46.727 --> 47:50.060
You need like, one of
those fixer people.

47:50.094 --> 47:50.893
What?

47:50.926 --> 47:51.893
Not a loan shark, Gilda.

47:51.926 --> 47:53.526
No, no, no, nothing like that.

48:00.526 --> 48:02.993
I can personally recommend him.

48:04.627 --> 48:07.593
We went on a very
hot date last week.

48:07.627 --> 48:08.194
Did you?

48:08.227 --> 48:10.526
Yeah, you're sorted.

48:10.560 --> 48:12.027
That's what he does.

48:13.460 --> 48:18.127
Look, Lee has got a
very personal touch.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.493
I gave him nine out of 10.

48:20.526 --> 48:21.560
Huh, only nine.

48:21.593 --> 48:24.660
Well, I'm never going to
give a score of 10, darling.

48:27.627 --> 48:28.959
Lee.

48:28.994 --> 48:30.859
Hello, darling.

48:31.826 --> 48:34.727
I'd like to introduce
you to a friend of mine.

48:35.627 --> 48:37.859
Yeah, she's gorgeous.

48:38.792 --> 48:42.426
No, I haven't but I can
take a selfie of us.

48:42.460 --> 48:43.094
No.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.693
Oh, sorry, Lee.

48:45.727 --> 48:47.127
She's just gone the bog.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.493
Oh, I mean, she's just
gone to the loo, er

48:49.526 --> 48:51.493
when she comes back, yeah.

48:51.526 --> 48:53.660
Yes, so yes, her name's Angie,

48:53.693 --> 48:56.493
and I'm sure you're
gonna like her.

48:56.526 --> 48:58.027
Known her for ages.

48:59.060 --> 49:00.560
Tomorrow afternoon?

49:01.460 --> 49:03.060
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

49:03.094 --> 49:06.560
Okay, good luck to the
both of you, all right.

49:06.593 --> 49:07.426
Sorted.

49:09.759 --> 49:11.627
Came to my dad to
help pay them off.

49:13.526 --> 49:16.660
I don't understand how did
she arrange to pay him back?

49:17.994 --> 49:19.693
That's probably how I fit in,

49:21.027 --> 49:25.660
because she didn't
have regular income,

49:25.693 --> 49:27.693
he had to come to
another arrangement,

49:29.693 --> 49:30.994
you were the inspiration.

49:32.227 --> 49:33.127
I will tell.

49:36.627 --> 49:37.593
I'll tell you.

49:44.792 --> 49:47.426
The suspense is killing me, Sam.

49:51.493 --> 49:54.627
So 10 grand and you
need it straightaway.

49:55.660 --> 49:56.493
Ideally, yeah.

49:57.792 --> 49:59.027
What do you do?

49:59.060 --> 50:00.826
You spend your old
man's money, yeah?

50:01.927 --> 50:03.127
Something like that.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.660
But you're a bad girl.

50:12.127 --> 50:16.060
Angie, I love to lend you
the money of course I would,

50:16.094 --> 50:20.593
but the big question is, will
you be able to pay me back?

50:20.627 --> 50:22.060
You know, that's
what I'm thinking.

50:28.692 --> 50:31.127
But I have a soft
spot for bad girls,

50:32.493 --> 50:34.426
especially once
as lovely as you.

50:35.627 --> 50:36.960
Let me see what I can do.

50:37.927 --> 50:38.759
Okay.

50:39.960 --> 50:44.792
So does that mean you think
you can help me, Mr. Leicester?

50:47.659 --> 50:48.726
Why don't you call me Lee?

50:52.460 --> 50:53.726
You know what?

50:53.759 --> 50:54.726
I think we could work
quite nicely together.

50:56.593 --> 50:59.060
Your old man the loss adjuster.

50:59.094 --> 51:01.027
He could prove to
be quite useful

51:01.060 --> 51:02.659
in our little business venture.

51:04.792 --> 51:06.493
You should have the e-mail.

51:07.860 --> 51:10.759
The burglary has upset them
rather profoundly Mr. Dyer,

51:10.792 --> 51:12.826
and the Henderson's
are very long standing

51:12.860 --> 51:14.094
and important clients,

51:14.127 --> 51:16.692
and I promised we would
send over our best man.

51:17.460 --> 51:19.759
He's really giving
me a hard time.

51:20.759 --> 51:24.692
Please, please, could
you just squeeze them in?

51:25.426 --> 51:27.060
Yeah Polly, I've
got the e-mail here.

51:27.094 --> 51:29.592
Don't worry about it, I'll
sort you out leave it with me.

51:29.626 --> 51:31.560
Okay, bye, bye.

51:33.659 --> 51:34.560
Ah, thank you.

51:34.592 --> 51:37.094
That was Polly another burglary.

51:37.127 --> 51:38.526
Now.

51:38.560 --> 51:39.759
I have to get running.

51:44.127 --> 51:45.127
- Gotta go.
- Okay.

51:46.493 --> 51:48.094
- I'll be back at six.
- Okay.

51:48.127 --> 51:49.094
- Love you.
- Love you.

51:49.127 --> 51:50.127
- Bye.
- Bye.

52:05.626 --> 52:06.526
Hey, darling, it's me.

52:06.559 --> 52:07.860
Ang.

52:07.894 --> 52:09.692
Yeah, I've got
another one for you.

52:10.960 --> 52:11.793
Oh yeah.

52:12.927 --> 52:14.559
All right look,
I'll tell you what,

52:14.592 --> 52:17.659
why don't you come over
here and take it from there?

52:17.692 --> 52:19.559
- Yeah.
- Good.

52:19.592 --> 52:21.726
- All right, I see you soon.
- Yeah.

52:23.894 --> 52:25.760
Sounds like Ang is coming good.

52:27.760 --> 52:28.559
Nice.

52:31.860 --> 52:33.127
Nobody ever gets everything.

52:34.726 --> 52:37.592
They don't have enough time
or they miss something.

52:38.860 --> 52:40.860
Miss something,
what do you mean?

52:40.894 --> 52:43.793
A piece of jewellery
or a piece of art.

52:46.060 --> 52:46.860
Or a painting.

52:55.894 --> 52:59.127
All right, you get in
there like a ghost,

52:59.160 --> 53:00.659
quick as you can.

53:00.692 --> 53:02.160
- Okay.
- Go on in.

54:36.927 --> 54:37.827
Come on, Sam.

55:36.194 --> 55:37.027
Sorted?

55:42.927 --> 55:43.960
Sorted.

55:45.927 --> 55:46.960
Good boy.

55:52.960 --> 55:56.127
I know people like the
Henderson's are properly insured,

55:58.459 --> 56:00.593
because you were called in,

56:00.627 --> 56:02.894
so they get paid.

56:03.994 --> 56:05.960
Angie gets to pay down her loan,

56:08.860 --> 56:09.827
and I get a bit.

56:09.860 --> 56:10.994
Everyone's happy.

56:12.194 --> 56:13.693
Are you sure about that?

56:17.127 --> 56:20.492
Right, it was over here.

56:22.827 --> 56:25.060
Mr. Dyer, in your own time.

56:26.727 --> 56:29.160
I don't know how I actually
didn't notice it, Mr. Dyer.

56:31.727 --> 56:36.693
For goodness sake, it's been
in my family for generations.

56:36.727 --> 56:37.994
Of course, I understand,
Mr. Anderson.

56:38.027 --> 56:39.927
It's extremely
unfortunate, I'll be sure...

56:39.960 --> 56:40.994
Unfortunate?

56:41.727 --> 56:44.560
It's a downright bloody
disgrace, bastards.

56:44.593 --> 56:45.492
Yeah bastards.

56:45.526 --> 56:46.994
Did you know?

56:47.027 --> 56:49.459
This is the second time I've
been burgled in 12 months.

56:49.493 --> 56:52.459
I mean, what do the
police actually do?

56:52.493 --> 56:55.493
I'll tell you stopping motorists

56:55.526 --> 56:57.560
and not catching drug addicts.

56:57.593 --> 56:59.860
Oh yes I do, drug addicts, yes,

56:59.894 --> 57:01.960
Yes, I do agree with
you, Mr. Henderson.

57:01.994 --> 57:03.927
Do you, do you really?

57:03.960 --> 57:05.760
I don't think you actually do.

57:13.960 --> 57:17.526
so how much hoovering
have you done, Sam?

57:22.627 --> 57:23.693
Who might you be?

57:24.860 --> 57:26.894
Actually, he is
just a hoover man.

57:26.927 --> 57:29.425
Norman never said there
will be three of you,

57:29.460 --> 57:32.060
and anyway you look way
too young for me honey,

57:32.094 --> 57:33.927
cleaner or not.

57:33.960 --> 57:35.994
- No.
- Actually, Ms. Purdy,

57:36.027 --> 57:37.493
he's just a virgin.

57:37.526 --> 57:38.160
Virgin?

57:39.960 --> 57:41.827
I can be gentle to you honey.

57:44.094 --> 57:47.927
Oh, my days, I can't
stand the smell in here.

57:47.960 --> 57:48.960
It stinks.

57:55.160 --> 57:56.526
God, I need some air.

58:02.127 --> 58:05.426
Tell me you haven't been
robbing from poor Norman.

58:05.460 --> 58:07.094
What?

58:07.127 --> 58:08.793
No, how could you think that?

58:08.827 --> 58:10.027
Because you dress
for a robbery, Sam.

58:10.060 --> 58:12.493
Yeah, I saw you pull out a rat,

58:12.526 --> 58:13.426
it seemed reasonable.

58:13.460 --> 58:14.793
So what are you doing here?

58:17.460 --> 58:19.994
I promised Norman I
wouldn't tell you.

58:21.727 --> 58:24.027
I don't think he'll
hear us anymore, do you?

58:25.894 --> 58:26.727
I guess.

58:27.994 --> 58:29.160
A promises is a promise.

58:33.860 --> 58:36.593
Now, go and have a look.

58:36.627 --> 58:37.460
Go on.

58:42.994 --> 58:44.660
It's the nurse.

58:52.493 --> 58:55.894
Hello, Dr. Wicksteed
is expecting me.

58:55.927 --> 58:57.526
A nurse.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.460
Yes, I have an appointment.

58:59.493 --> 59:02.060
He didn't mention
no medical fetish,

59:02.094 --> 59:04.060
and I just don't
do girl on girl.

59:05.627 --> 59:07.693
Sorry, I think there's
been some confusion now...

59:07.727 --> 59:08.627
Look at you.

59:09.526 --> 59:11.060
Can you make more effort?

59:11.094 --> 59:15.660
Heels, stockings, damn liberty.

59:16.526 --> 59:18.094
I've had enough.

59:18.126 --> 59:18.960
Sorry.

59:19.960 --> 59:21.560
I can't just leave.

59:23.627 --> 59:25.060
I'm so sorry.

59:25.094 --> 59:28.393
Please, come in and
do excuse the smell.

59:29.159 --> 59:31.660
Oh, what's causing it?

59:31.693 --> 59:33.526
Oh, decaying flesh, I'd imagine.

59:34.493 --> 59:37.094
Oh my God, when did it happen?

59:37.126 --> 59:39.093
Well I don't know exactly, but
it's good we've wrapped it up

59:39.126 --> 59:41.460
in plastic bags and
it's ready to throw,

59:41.493 --> 59:43.027
so it's fine.

59:43.060 --> 59:44.660
Sorry, I need to
do an examination.

59:44.693 --> 59:46.027
What do you need to do that?

59:46.060 --> 59:47.060
Hold on?

59:47.093 --> 59:47.894
You're gonna have to pay me,

59:47.927 --> 59:50.093
'cause I'm not waiting
here any longer.

59:50.126 --> 59:53.126
And if my Steedy has decided
to get himself a new playmate,

59:53.159 --> 59:54.526
No he's actually...

59:54.560 --> 59:56.126
then you're gonna
have to compensate me.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.393
How much?

01:00:04.027 --> 01:00:06.060
Just 100 to you sweetheart.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.426
Give my best to Steedy
won't you for me.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.693
Oh, and keep that cute little
virgin boy 'til next time,

01:00:32.727 --> 01:00:33.927
won't you?

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.927
Thanks Ms. Purdy.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.426
Oh bless you Dr. Wicksteed.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.493
I was just being too silly,

01:01:01.526 --> 01:01:02.994
I thought you were
talking about a rat.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:05.493
We just removed a rat from
under the floorboards.

01:01:06.927 --> 01:01:09.126
I'm so sorry for your loss,

01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:11.026
and I didn't get here sooner.

01:01:11.059 --> 01:01:12.059
Hey, what?

01:01:15.593 --> 01:01:17.493
You weren't expecting
it to be so sudden.

01:01:17.526 --> 01:01:19.894
Well, I wasn't really
expecting it at all.

01:01:19.927 --> 01:01:20.993
He didn't tell you?

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:25.927
I'm so sorry, tell me what?

01:01:33.993 --> 01:01:36.493
It was only a matter of days.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.993
He insisted he remained at home.

01:01:41.193 --> 01:01:42.993
You mean he knew he was dying?

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.393
Yes.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.393
You're Martin, aren't you?

01:01:50.593 --> 01:01:51.693
Yes, yes, I am.

01:01:52.894 --> 01:01:55.126
He said he wanted to see
you before he passed.

01:01:58.159 --> 01:01:59.660
I'm so glad that he did.

01:02:01.493 --> 01:02:02.593
So am I, thank you.

01:02:04.827 --> 01:02:05.693
Bless you, Norman.

01:02:13.727 --> 01:02:16.194
I'm so sorry, you've been
called out unnecessarily.

01:02:16.227 --> 01:02:17.426
The coroner is on his way now,

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.460
so I think he was
just panicking,

01:02:19.493 --> 01:02:20.426
he didn't know what to do.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.827
Hello there.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.026
I'm sorry, we don't
take dead bodies.

01:02:25.059 --> 01:02:25.860
What?

01:02:25.894 --> 01:02:27.160
You don't take what?

01:02:27.194 --> 01:02:29.926
Martin, it's all right,
the coroner is on his way.

01:02:30.793 --> 01:02:32.093
Okay.

01:02:32.126 --> 01:02:34.493
Please don't worry
about anything.

01:02:34.526 --> 01:02:35.827
Dr. Wicksteed made sure

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.194
that all the arrangements
were in place.

01:02:37.227 --> 01:02:38.426
- Oh, he did?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.894
Okay, good, that's
very reassuring.

01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:40.793
Thank you for letting me know.

01:02:40.827 --> 01:02:41.660
Thank you.

01:02:45.894 --> 01:02:46.727
Oh, shit.

01:02:48.059 --> 01:02:50.627
- I'm sorry.
- You need a new car mate.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.727
I need a new everything, Sam.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.526
Right, come on, help you
change it for the spare.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.727
Oh, I don't have a spare.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.660
I guess it's the
bus for you then.

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:01.493
Yes.

01:03:03.627 --> 01:03:06.160
Sam, I really don't mean to pry,

01:03:06.194 --> 01:03:08.593
but you really haven't
told me anything.

01:03:08.627 --> 01:03:09.460
Yeah, I know.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.093
I promised Norman.

01:03:12.127 --> 01:03:13.827
Yes, jeez I know you said that.

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.893
And you know I really
do respect that,

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:18.693
but I just want some
closure, you know,

01:03:18.727 --> 01:03:20.993
maybe some understanding
if that makes sense.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.793
I see why Norman liked you.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.593
You do?

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:51.026
You know, I do understand,
a promises is a promise,

01:03:53.493 --> 01:03:55.493
but Norman meant so much to me.

01:03:58.859 --> 01:04:01.393
What kind of work
did you do for him?

01:04:03.627 --> 01:04:05.859
I know this might come as a bit

01:04:05.893 --> 01:04:07.493
of a surprise to you, Martin,

01:04:08.526 --> 01:04:09.727
but our dear old Norman,

01:04:11.026 --> 01:04:12.959
he wasn't quite what
he appeared to be.

01:04:14.793 --> 01:04:16.460
What do you mean?

01:04:16.493 --> 01:04:18.127
Look, I've got to go, I'll
catch up with you later.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.593
What do you mean, Sam, Sam.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.926
for Christmas.

01:04:31.959 --> 01:04:33.426
Come on, get to it.

01:04:34.826 --> 01:04:36.493
What's in the bag, mate?

01:04:36.526 --> 01:04:37.460
Another lottery, aye.

01:04:37.493 --> 01:04:38.893
- What do you got?
- No, no, no.

01:04:38.926 --> 01:04:39.826
- What's in the bag?
- Listen, I gotta get home.

01:04:39.859 --> 01:04:41.060
No, nothing's in the bag.

01:04:41.094 --> 01:04:42.027
- What's in the bag?
- Do you know him?

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.959
- Who?
- Sam, what's in the bag?

01:04:42.993 --> 01:04:43.760
You want a lift or something.

01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:44.959
Nothing's in the bag?

01:04:44.993 --> 01:04:46.060
It don't look like
nothing to me.

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:48.094
- Nothing.
- What's in the bag?

01:04:48.127 --> 01:04:49.593
Come on.

01:04:49.627 --> 01:04:50.593
I'm just, I'm going home,
I'm trying to get home,

01:04:50.627 --> 01:04:51.526
that's what I'm doing.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.493
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:04:55.526 --> 01:04:56.426
Go on.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.094
Take it if I can go home.

01:04:57.127 --> 01:04:58.027
- Yeah.
- Just take it.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:58.993
- Sod off.
- Okay.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.160
Kinky.

01:05:07.526 --> 01:05:08.760
So what is there?

01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:10.792
God only knows, but if
it's wrapped up this good,

01:05:10.826 --> 01:05:12.660
it must be must
be pretty special.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:16.460
Geez man, what is that stink.

01:05:19.194 --> 01:05:20.027
Oh my God.

01:05:46.826 --> 01:05:48.127
Oh hello.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.660
What's happening?

01:05:49.693 --> 01:05:51.926
I'll explain, please close
the door, close the door.

01:05:56.127 --> 01:05:59.060
Hey, have you seen a punk
in a shitty grey suit?

01:05:59.094 --> 01:06:01.960
Oh, I don't think so, no, sorry.

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.493
It's all over my hands.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:27.160
Hello, hello, hello
is anyone there.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.960
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:06:46.994 --> 01:06:48.426
- They're gone?
- Yes.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.094
Come on.

01:06:50.826 --> 01:06:52.160
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

01:06:52.194 --> 01:06:52.994
You too.

01:06:53.027 --> 01:06:54.493
That's very kind of you.

01:06:54.526 --> 01:06:55.560
You're welcome, Martin.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.627
We know each other?

01:07:00.659 --> 01:07:03.859
Yes, you bought some
flowers from me a while back

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.160
for your anniversary.

01:07:07.526 --> 01:07:08.127
I'm Emily.

01:07:09.627 --> 01:07:12.792
Well, you have a very,
very good memory, Emily.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.894
- You have such a lovely name.
- Thank you.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.826
I remember now.

01:07:20.593 --> 01:07:21.894
The declined credit card.

01:07:21.927 --> 01:07:24.593
- Yeah.
- Oh, so embarrassing.

01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:25.994
So was I right,

01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:28.160
did your wife have a
little surprise for you?

01:07:28.194 --> 01:07:31.626
Oh yes, quite a big one.

01:07:31.659 --> 01:07:32.460
That's nice.

01:07:32.493 --> 01:07:33.960
No, not really,

01:07:33.994 --> 01:07:36.060
but everybody must
think I'm crazy.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.493
I'm so sorry, I've had
quite a bit of a day.

01:07:39.994 --> 01:07:40.894
This is so sweet of you.

01:07:40.927 --> 01:07:42.560
What do I owe you for this?

01:07:42.593 --> 01:07:44.927
Oh no, It's my treat for
locking you in the black hole.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.826
Well, actually, I'm kind
of glad you did.

01:07:55.994 --> 01:07:57.493
Shall I hold this for you?

01:07:58.526 --> 01:07:59.726
Why were they chasing you?

01:08:01.493 --> 01:08:04.792
Well, kind of a strange story.

01:08:04.827 --> 01:08:06.960
I gave them a dead rat in a bag.

01:08:09.526 --> 01:08:12.560
I do, true story, I'll
explain I promise.

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:17.094
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.626
But it looks like something
stronger is in order.

01:08:20.894 --> 01:08:22.460
Can I buy you a drink?

01:08:23.493 --> 01:08:26.827
Be spontaneous, there is
no dress rehearsal in life,

01:08:26.859 --> 01:08:27.692
this is it.

01:08:28.926 --> 01:08:31.827
Oh, I'd love to, but
I can't I'm so sorry.

01:08:33.559 --> 01:08:34.759
Yes, yes, of course.

01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:36.792
Your wife will be
expecting you and...

01:08:36.827 --> 01:08:38.027
Oh no, no, no, no,

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.591
she's actually not
expecting me at all.

01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:42.493
Look to be honest.

01:08:42.526 --> 01:08:43.792
I really just don't think

01:08:43.827 --> 01:08:45.926
I'll be very good company
this evening that's all.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.559
Of course.

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:48.559
Yeah, I understand.

01:08:49.227 --> 01:08:50.759
Another time maybe?

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:51.591
Sure.

01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:53.127
You know where I am.

01:08:55.094 --> 01:08:55.926
Yes, I do.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:58.426
Yes, I do.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.725
Well, do you need any help?

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.792
Don't.

01:09:03.658 --> 01:09:05.591
Good night, Emily.

01:09:05.626 --> 01:09:06.859
Good night, Martin.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:31.792
Any spare change mate?

01:09:31.827 --> 01:09:33.460
Oh, change, change.

01:09:33.493 --> 01:09:34.760
Oh, I see, you know what?

01:09:34.792 --> 01:09:35.859
I actually don't
have any change,

01:09:35.894 --> 01:09:37.094
but I would give it to you...

01:09:37.127 --> 01:09:39.760
Yeah right, what? just
a wallet full of notes.

01:09:39.792 --> 01:09:40.658
Have a great day.

01:09:40.692 --> 01:09:41.591
What!

01:09:41.626 --> 01:09:43.127
What are we talking about?

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.827
I mean what use would I
have for my own money, huh?

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:48.460
Oh here, here, here take it.

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:50.960
I'm sick of this.

01:09:50.993 --> 01:09:53.426
Aye, thanks you didn't have
to be be snarky about it.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.127
- It's nearly Christmas.
- Snarky?

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.460
What the, I was being snarky?

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.127
Yeah, you were.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.592
We're homeless,
we've got nothing.

01:10:00.626 --> 01:10:01.760
Well, you want me to treat
you like God almighty

01:10:01.793 --> 01:10:03.492
because you dropped
me a few quid.

01:10:03.525 --> 01:10:05.727
It's not a few quid,
it's all I've got left,

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.060
you hear me, everything.

01:10:07.094 --> 01:10:09.860
What are you talking
about it's all I had.

01:10:09.894 --> 01:10:11.027
Calm down mate.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:15.160
Briefcase, suit, what are you
an accountant or something?

01:10:15.194 --> 01:10:17.693
Oh, of course, of course,
I didn't please you, sir.

01:10:17.727 --> 01:10:18.760
I didn't please you.

01:10:18.793 --> 01:10:19.927
I wasn't generous
enough was I, huh?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.492
Take the bloody suit,
I don't want it.

01:10:22.525 --> 01:10:23.160
I'm sick of it.

01:10:23.194 --> 01:10:24.525
I don't want it either.

01:10:26.127 --> 01:10:27.559
What do you mean
you don't want it?

01:10:27.592 --> 01:10:28.860
Suit's not exactly
well tailored is it?

01:10:28.894 --> 01:10:30.860
And anyway it's no use
without the trousers.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:32.827
I don't believe this.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.793
Such wisdom, such wisdom.

01:10:35.827 --> 01:10:37.727
No suit without trousers.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.559
How bloody wise of you.

01:10:39.592 --> 01:10:41.160
Here, hey, you know what?

01:10:41.194 --> 01:10:44.459
Here take 'em, take
'em I don't need it.

01:10:44.492 --> 01:10:47.492
Here, have my bloody shoes,

01:10:47.525 --> 01:10:49.559
and I've got a good idea what
you're gonna ask for next.

01:10:49.592 --> 01:10:51.827
Do you want the shirt
off a back, huh, is that?

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.727
That's what everyone does to me.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.994
Huh, here we go.

01:10:54.027 --> 01:10:55.459
How do you like this
one, has it suit you?

01:10:55.492 --> 01:10:57.660
You think it's nice, huh?

01:10:57.693 --> 01:10:58.760
You like this one?

01:10:58.793 --> 01:10:59.793
Here we go.

01:10:59.827 --> 01:11:00.626
Here we go.

01:11:01.994 --> 01:11:03.425
You like that.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:04.860
Here, just take
the bloody thing.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.559
Anything else I can do for you.

01:11:09.592 --> 01:11:10.525
Happy Christmas.

01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:15.525
It's got no buttons on it now.

01:12:52.627 --> 01:12:53.459
come on.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.627
Sorry, governor.

01:14:46.627 --> 01:14:48.760
Once upon a time,

01:14:48.793 --> 01:14:51.127
a very wealthy man had
the great misfortune

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.927
to fall out of a plane.

01:14:54.526 --> 01:14:58.426
As he fell the wind stripped
him of his designer suit,

01:14:59.226 --> 01:15:01.027
his Italian patent shoes,

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.094
crocodile wallet, gold
watch, everything.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.760
And when he eventually hit the
Earth he was all but naked.

01:15:59.493 --> 01:16:02.693
You're pawning or
you're selling?

01:16:02.727 --> 01:16:03.894
I'm selling.

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.060
You know what they say

01:16:15.827 --> 01:16:18.126
there's plenty of
fish in the sea,

01:16:22.994 --> 01:16:26.927
if you fancy a swim let me know.

01:17:12.793 --> 01:17:13.627
Hello.

01:17:20.894 --> 01:17:22.027
Nice.

01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:25.627
Tell me about Norman and the
kind of work you did for him.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:27.193
It can wait until he's buried.

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:30.727
No, because I think now
he might appreciate you

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.126
telling me the truth, Sam.

01:17:33.159 --> 01:17:34.460
They were on to him.

01:17:36.593 --> 01:17:37.426
Who?

01:17:38.727 --> 01:17:39.560
Everyone.

01:17:42.226 --> 01:17:43.460
Why?

01:17:45.126 --> 01:17:46.860
He had fake patients
on his books.

01:17:46.894 --> 01:17:47.727
What?

01:17:54.793 --> 01:17:56.093
Ghost patients.

01:17:56.126 --> 01:17:57.693
Now, I know what you mean.

01:17:57.727 --> 01:17:58.927
Like you don't know what I mean.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.827
They were literally ghosts.

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.059
Come in.

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:11.059
Anna, how very kind.

01:18:11.093 --> 01:18:13.526
I take it I'm finished.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.460
Yes, that's your lot
for today, doctor.

01:18:15.493 --> 01:18:17.660
Well, you get yourself
off home now then.

01:18:18.993 --> 01:18:21.026
Don't work too late.

01:18:21.059 --> 01:18:22.193
Good night, Anna.

01:19:00.693 --> 01:19:03.727
Good afternoon, nice to see you.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.059
Nice to see you.

01:19:05.093 --> 01:19:06.526
Good afternoon.

01:19:09.093 --> 01:19:11.426
I didn't know you
was a real vicar.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.493
Good afternoon.

01:19:13.526 --> 01:19:16.160
Don't worry, your
secret's safe with me.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.059
Nice to see you, good afternoon.

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.727
You're in church ain't
you got no shame.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.493
You need to put those
creased up baps away.

01:19:30.526 --> 01:19:31.560
Excuse me.

01:19:36.493 --> 01:19:39.460
Oh, dum dum and dudu.

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.827
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

01:19:51.827 --> 01:19:53.460
Why would he do that?

01:19:53.493 --> 01:19:55.160
Suppose he wanted
to help people.

01:19:58.227 --> 01:19:59.660
I'm lost Sam.

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:04.727
Have you heard of
the postcode lottery?

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.127
Mm-hmm.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.693
Different people were
eligible for different levels

01:20:08.727 --> 01:20:10.493
of care depending
on where they live.

01:20:10.526 --> 01:20:11.660
Yeah, I know that's terrible.

01:20:13.526 --> 01:20:18.526
Well, Norman would write
prescriptions for dead patients

01:20:22.493 --> 01:20:24.526
in order to give
medicines to patients

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.959
who weren't eligible for them.

01:20:29.526 --> 01:20:32.926
I'd pick up the prescriptions
and drop them off.

01:20:34.959 --> 01:20:37.893
Hey, that means you know
about Norman's condition.

01:20:37.926 --> 01:20:38.727
What?

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:39.560
No.

01:20:39.593 --> 01:20:43.060
Look, I was just skint.

01:20:45.826 --> 01:20:47.526
When a doctor offers
you some pocket money

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.493
you don't just assume he's bent.

01:20:49.526 --> 01:20:53.693
Sam, didn't you consider
getting a proper job, Sam?

01:20:53.727 --> 01:20:54.660
- I can't.
- Why?

01:20:54.693 --> 01:20:56.194
'Cause I'm still in school.

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:57.026
What?

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:57.859
Jesus!

01:21:00.893 --> 01:21:01.693
Sorry.

01:21:13.493 --> 01:21:17.760
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to all of you,

01:21:17.793 --> 01:21:21.826
as we gather in united
grief to mourn the loss

01:21:21.859 --> 01:21:25.792
and celebrate the life
of Dr. Norman Wicksteed.

01:21:26.993 --> 01:21:29.160
So, you knew what
Norman was up to?

01:21:29.194 --> 01:21:32.493
No, I just thought
he was a doctor.

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:36.560
It's fraud, Sam.

01:21:36.593 --> 01:21:37.627
I know.

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.593
- They caught him.
- Who?

01:21:42.627 --> 01:21:44.560
Some tosser shopped him.

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:50.426
A lot of the letters you
picked up in his house.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.493
Yeah, I saw them.

01:21:52.526 --> 01:21:57.426
A lot of them were bills
but, I guess why pay them

01:22:02.593 --> 01:22:05.393
when you know you're gonna die.

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:14.627
- Some of them,
- At the age of 18.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:18.127
some of them were from lawyers.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.959
The doctors were
taking legal action

01:22:21.693 --> 01:22:23.693
cost the government
a small fortune,

01:22:25.926 --> 01:22:28.660
They wanted it back.

01:22:28.693 --> 01:22:30.792
He believed that
his particular talent,

01:22:30.826 --> 01:22:32.060
Oh Norman.

01:22:32.094 --> 01:22:35.127
were best served in
the care of people,

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.094
and the healing of the sick.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.826
He enrolled in
many good schools.

01:22:40.859 --> 01:22:42.493
His heart was in the right
place, wasn't it Sam.

01:22:42.526 --> 01:22:45.027
And qualified
as a general practitioner

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.127
in the 1970s.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.994
- Always was.
- His practice

01:22:48.027 --> 01:22:49.560
Yeah.

01:22:52.526 --> 01:22:55.627
His health declined
in late '80s,

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:56.593
but he never lost his
passion.

01:22:56.627 --> 01:22:59.526
It doesn't make sense Martin.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.027
One of the hardest
things about life.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.660
Norman was an
anonymous author I believe.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.127
- It'll be okay.
- Which best sums up Norman

01:23:09.493 --> 01:23:14.027
to know even one life
has breathed easier

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.426
because you have lived.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.094
This is to have succeeded.

01:23:24.759 --> 01:23:27.027
In the name of our
Lord, Jesus Christ.

01:23:28.859 --> 01:23:31.560
Amen.

01:24:06.692 --> 01:24:07.726
Doing okay?

01:24:11.127 --> 01:24:12.659
He was well liked was Norman.

01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:17.560
A lot of people
paying their respects.

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.626
He must have helped
a lot of people.

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:24.792
I'm sure he did.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.060
They were gonna take everything,

01:24:33.094 --> 01:24:34.626
seize it all and sell it.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.560
That's what they do
these days, right?

01:24:42.127 --> 01:24:42.960
Come on.

01:24:45.659 --> 01:24:47.659
What are they gonna do
take his house, his car?

01:24:47.692 --> 01:24:49.759
No, not his car.

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:51.894
Why not?

01:24:52.827 --> 01:24:54.127
He transferred it to me.

01:24:56.659 --> 01:24:59.659
He arranged for the
papers, the logbook,

01:24:59.692 --> 01:25:02.659
and the keys to
me, post it to me.

01:25:02.692 --> 01:25:04.626
At first I thought
it was a joke,

01:25:04.659 --> 01:25:08.994
but I saw the previous owner
was Norman, It all made sense.

01:25:10.493 --> 01:25:11.426
He didn't tell you.

01:25:12.827 --> 01:25:13.659
No.

01:25:16.759 --> 01:25:17.626
The way he was.

01:25:18.726 --> 01:25:20.393
Really nice thing to do.

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.592
Yes, it was.

01:25:25.094 --> 01:25:26.692
I just need to pass my test now.

01:25:26.726 --> 01:25:27.860
That's the easy part.

01:25:29.692 --> 01:25:33.659
Oh, this was in the glovebox.

01:25:35.793 --> 01:25:38.027
Strict instructions
to give it to you.

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.793
- From Norman?
- Yeah.

01:25:42.793 --> 01:25:43.793
Bless him.

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:51.860
Oh, and also all the
claims on the house.

01:25:52.827 --> 01:25:53.726
he faked those.

01:25:56.793 --> 01:25:59.060
Like I said there was
no one living upstairs,

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.592
it's just him.

01:26:03.726 --> 01:26:04.827
Just alone, huh?

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:07.094
Bless his heart.

01:26:09.692 --> 01:26:12.127
I never checked I just thought
he was telling me the truth.

01:26:13.227 --> 01:26:14.060
Yeah.

01:26:15.692 --> 01:26:19.727
He was a really lonely but
very, very kind old man.

01:26:23.994 --> 01:26:24.827
Yes, he was

01:26:26.793 --> 01:26:27.960
You're not going to the wake?

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:33.525
No, it's not really my thing.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:40.160
It's not mine either Sam.

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:41.027
I'll see you.

01:26:57.659 --> 01:27:00.860
You know there's only one
cure for a fall, Martin,

01:27:00.894 --> 01:27:02.827
get back on the horse.

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.827
You really should learn

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.559
to appreciate the
value of your virtues.

01:27:08.894 --> 01:27:12.525
Be spontaneous, there is
no dress rehearsal in life,

01:27:12.559 --> 01:27:13.559
this is it.

01:27:38.559 --> 01:27:39.894
Hello.

01:27:39.927 --> 01:27:40.760
Hello.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.894
It's a lot more fun being
this side of the door

01:27:43.927 --> 01:27:45.027
than it is over there.

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.927
Hey, you look very smart.

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.459
I hardly recognize you.

01:27:49.492 --> 01:27:52.727
It's either a
wedding or a funeral?

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.094
Well, unfortunately it's a...

01:27:54.127 --> 01:27:56.860
- Oh, it's a funeral.
- Yeah.

01:27:56.894 --> 01:27:58.559
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:27:59.727 --> 01:28:03.194
Is there anything that I can do?

01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:04.592
Well, I need a drink,

01:28:04.627 --> 01:28:06.459
and I thought it would be lovely

01:28:06.492 --> 01:28:08.927
if you have time of
course to join me.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.127
Well, I'm only buying
if you promise not

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.060
to kick it over.

01:28:12.994 --> 01:28:16.660
Sounds fair, but I think
I owe you, come on.

01:28:21.194 --> 01:28:24.860
♪ Silent night ♪

01:28:24.894 --> 01:28:28.960

Merry Christmas.

01:28:46.127 --> 01:28:48.094
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:28:48.127 --> 01:28:50.525
I think it's this way actually.

01:28:50.559 --> 01:28:51.827
Warmer in here.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160
Here we are.

01:28:59.593 --> 01:29:00.492
Hello sir, how are you?

01:29:00.525 --> 01:29:02.425
Good, thanks, how are you?

01:29:02.459 --> 01:29:03.560
I'm good, thank you.

01:29:04.525 --> 01:29:05.894
What would you like?

01:29:05.927 --> 01:29:07.127
Surprise me.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.727
In that case, I think
a bottle of champagne.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.627
- Champagne?
- Yeah.

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:11.560
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:29:11.593 --> 01:29:15.760
Wow, you didn't need to do that.

01:29:15.793 --> 01:29:16.994
I thought it would be fun.

01:29:18.727 --> 01:29:21.525
Yeah, would you
excuse me a moment?

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.793
Sure, okay, sure.

01:29:23.827 --> 01:29:25.459
I'll bring it outside to
your table if you like.

01:29:25.492 --> 01:29:29.894
Thank you, sir, it's
very nice of you.

01:29:29.927 --> 01:29:31.660
You've put your hair
down it looks beautiful.

01:29:31.693 --> 01:29:33.027
Oh, thank you.

01:29:34.627 --> 01:29:35.560
Thank you sir.

01:29:36.459 --> 01:29:37.593
Have a wonderful evening, sir.

01:29:37.627 --> 01:29:38.994
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

01:29:46.927 --> 01:29:47.960
What's wrong?

01:29:48.894 --> 01:29:49.927
Nothing.

01:29:52.526 --> 01:29:53.593
Actually, everything,

01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:57.860
but right now nothing.

01:30:03.927 --> 01:30:06.860
Do you mind me asking who died?

01:30:06.894 --> 01:30:08.459
He was a client.

01:30:13.094 --> 01:30:15.094
Actually he was a dear friend.

01:30:18.793 --> 01:30:19.727
His name is Norman.

01:30:20.894 --> 01:30:22.160
I'm so sorry.

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.660
Thank you.

01:30:24.693 --> 01:30:25.860
He was very sick.

01:30:25.894 --> 01:30:28.459
I just, I didn't know
he never told me.

01:30:31.994 --> 01:30:32.894
To new beginnings.

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.994
Yeah, absolutely.

01:30:44.593 --> 01:30:49.094
You know, my life has
been pretty terrible

01:30:49.127 --> 01:30:50.560
for some time now.

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:56.760
The day that Norman died
it was a crazy day probably

01:30:56.793 --> 01:30:58.793
if not the worst day of my life,

01:31:02.127 --> 01:31:06.927
and then you know, you,
you saved me.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.127
I've been thinking about this
story of this very wealthy man

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.894
who'd unfortunately
fallen from an airplane.

01:31:12.927 --> 01:31:14.426
Oh my God.

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.960
He had a clearly much
worse day than mine,

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:22.827
but as he fell to Earth the
force of the wind stripped him

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.060
off everything; his crocodile
wallet, his gold watch,

01:31:26.094 --> 01:31:29.094
his Italian shoes, designer
suit, all of it gone.

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:34.460
And then he finally
hit the Earth,

01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:38.060
and they found him all
but naked in a field.

01:31:40.894 --> 01:31:41.827
He was smiling,

01:31:43.727 --> 01:31:45.460
and I never understood why,

01:31:45.493 --> 01:31:50.094
and I think finally,
I do understand now.

01:31:51.226 --> 01:31:52.060
Yes.

01:31:53.193 --> 01:31:55.593
Well, the possessions,
the belongings,

01:31:55.627 --> 01:31:58.894
the responsibilities, you
know, maybe they tied him down

01:32:00.127 --> 01:32:03.760
to a life that wasn't
truly him, you know?

01:32:06.159 --> 01:32:07.627
Maybe in those last few moments,

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.460
in those last few moments
he felt free you know,

01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.027
totally free, you
know what I mean?

01:32:18.027 --> 01:32:19.027
And how about you?

01:32:20.094 --> 01:32:21.960
Are you free?

01:32:23.894 --> 01:32:26.159
I think I have some
pain to walk through,

01:32:29.793 --> 01:32:30.627
but maybe I am.

01:32:32.493 --> 01:32:33.126
Maybe I am.

01:32:35.126 --> 01:32:36.994
I mean I feel I got nothing.

01:32:37.027 --> 01:32:38.760
- Nothing left to lose.
- Nothing left to lose.

01:32:38.793 --> 01:32:39.660
Exactly, right?

01:32:40.994 --> 01:32:44.094
It kind of gets easier
in some crazy way.

01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:45.094
But you have you.

01:32:47.126 --> 01:32:48.126
Thank you.

01:32:49.094 --> 01:32:50.159
Yes, I do.

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:52.793
Yes, I do.

01:32:54.193 --> 01:32:55.793
I'm glad.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:57.593
So am I.

01:32:59.627 --> 01:33:00.927
Merry Christmas, Martin.

01:33:02.159 --> 01:33:03.994
Merry Christmas, Emily.

01:33:04.027 --> 01:33:06.093
I'm glad you're here.

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.894
You know, I've got this
something, it's from Norman.

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:21.960
You think he might have
wanted you to open it?

01:33:24.126 --> 01:33:25.159
Mm-hmm.

01:33:29.493 --> 01:33:31.126
Well, so sweet, look.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.560
Bless him, look at what he did.

01:33:38.593 --> 01:33:40.093
Dearest Martin,

01:33:40.126 --> 01:33:41.827
you're the winner.

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.393
The son I never.

01:33:44.159 --> 01:33:46.894
Oh, what does he
mean I'm the winner?

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.193
Does he mean what
I think he means?

01:33:51.226 --> 01:33:52.760
Look, look, take a look.

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:53.627
Please, here.

01:33:59.193 --> 01:34:02.059
Oh my God, oh my God, you won.

01:34:02.093 --> 01:34:05.093
- What, what we won.
- This is the winning ticket.

01:34:05.126 --> 01:34:08.894
You won.

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.526
- Oh my God.
- It is.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.059
Norman, thank you.
