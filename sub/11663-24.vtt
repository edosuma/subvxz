The Golden Girls...

00:42.633 --> 00:44.300
I have great news.

00:44.367 --> 00:45.900
I just talked to my daughter Janet.

00:45.967 --> 00:49.367
She and my granddaughter
are coming to visit.

00:49.433 --> 00:51.233
I've never been
so happy.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.767
Isn't Janet the daughter
who hates you?

00:54.266 --> 00:56.033
Well, that didn't last long, did it?

00:57.367 --> 00:59.834
Look, Rose. You missed
your high school reunion

00:59.900 --> 01:03.300
because you didn't feel well.
Here's your chance to go to one...

01:04.900 --> 01:07.934
and for Dorothy and me
to meet some men.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.400
Me too. Me too.

01:11.467 --> 01:14.266
-Dorothy!
-(gasps)

01:14.333 --> 01:17.000
Oh, my God!
Somebody get help!

01:17.066 --> 01:19.000
Oh, girls.
Thank God you're here.

01:19.066 --> 01:21.233
Sorry I scared you.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.934
The doctor just wants me to
stay overnight for observation.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.600
Don't be sorry. We're just
so happy you're feeling better.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.633
I've never been afraid of dying.

01:30.700 --> 01:34.066
That's 'cause I'm not
going to stay dead.

01:34.133 --> 01:38.000
I'm going to get frozen,
and I need your solemn promises

01:38.066 --> 01:41.433
that you'll have
your heads frozen too.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.667
Oh, excuse me. We're
here to pick up our friend.

01:43.734 --> 01:46.834
Are they doing some tests
before they let her go?

01:46.900 --> 01:48.400
Rose Nylund?

01:48.467 --> 01:50.600
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

01:50.667 --> 01:52.433
but she went
into cardiac arrest.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.567
They're prepping her
for surgery.

01:54.633 --> 01:55.967
Sur--

01:57.333 --> 01:58.000
oh.

01:58.066 --> 02:00.100
(serene music playing)

02:26.834 --> 02:30.066
Wait. What do you mean
she's going into surgery?

02:30.133 --> 02:32.266
I talked to her last night.
She was fine.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.600
That's why we keep people
for observation.

02:34.667 --> 02:35.934
Can we see her?

02:36.000 --> 02:36.800
You're related?

02:36.867 --> 02:38.200
No. We're her friends.

02:38.266 --> 02:41.300
Only her family
can see her now.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.100
We've contacted
her daughter.

02:43.166 --> 02:45.800
She'll be going into surgery
once the doctor gets here.

02:45.867 --> 02:48.333
Kirsten lives an hour away.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.533
We don't want Rose
to be alone now.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.066
Those are the rules.
But don't worry.

02:53.133 --> 02:56.100
-She's in stable condition.
-Why can't we see her?

02:56.166 --> 02:58.233
I said family only.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.967
You've never met
this woman's family.

03:01.033 --> 03:04.433
They live in a place
called St. Olaf.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.200
They fight over whether
it's "macaroni and cheese"

03:07.266 --> 03:09.100
or "cheese and macaroni."

03:09.967 --> 03:13.734
They have given cows
the right to vote.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.033
A magician once pulled
a rabbit out of a hat.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.166
They burned him as a witch.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.600
Don't look at me like that.
It's the truth.

03:22.667 --> 03:25.133
I'm sure you're very close
to Mrs. Nylund.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.500
-I know you feel like family.
-I am family.

03:28.567 --> 03:31.667
I'm her long-lost Swedish mother.

03:31.734 --> 03:33.333
You're her Swedish mother?

03:33.400 --> 03:36.233
(Swedish accent)
Yah. Yah.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.266
You betcha. Sure.

03:39.734 --> 03:41.600
Come on. Let me in.

03:41.667 --> 03:42.467
I'm afraid not.

03:42.533 --> 03:44.100
Let me try.

03:44.166 --> 03:48.834
Nurse, we realize
that the hospital has rules,

03:48.900 --> 03:52.500
and you have to try to uphold
those rules, but you have to realize

03:52.567 --> 03:54.834
that this is a very special case,

03:54.900 --> 03:57.066
so I'm going
to quote from the bible

03:57.133 --> 04:01.100
just to show
you how determined we really are.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.867
Now, the good book says...

04:04.300 --> 04:08.967
oh, neither rain, nor sleet, nor...
nor dark of night

04:09.033 --> 04:14.133
shall keepeth uth
from our appointed rounds.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.133
Amen.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.967
I can see
you are a nonbeliever.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.467
I think it's nice that
you're trying to quote the bible.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.500
The only thing that's been in
more hotel rooms than she has,

04:27.567 --> 04:29.367
and she can't remember a word of it.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.767
Look, it's obvious they're not
gonna let us see Rose

04:33.834 --> 04:36.967
so I think the only thing
we can do is pray.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.633
All right.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.700
Oh, please, God,
hear our prayer.

04:42.767 --> 04:48.967
From the halls of Mount Azuma,
to the shores of Tripoli...

04:50.600 --> 04:53.200
(mellow music playing)

05:04.834 --> 05:06.633
Fine. Thank you.
Goodbye.

05:06.700 --> 05:07.900
Has Kirsten left yet?

05:07.967 --> 05:10.400
Her husband says
he's staying with the girls

05:10.467 --> 05:12.667
and she's on her way.

05:12.734 --> 05:15.900
I still can't believe
they're not letting us see Rose.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.600
-I brought some food.
-This is ridiculous.

05:18.667 --> 05:21.266
Tell me about it,
11.50 for coffee and doughnuts.

05:23.033 --> 05:24.900
Where'd you get
the money for this?

05:24.967 --> 05:26.633
I took it from your purse.

05:28.233 --> 05:31.066
Oh, Sophia. You know
what the bible says,

05:31.133 --> 05:32.500
thou shalt not steal.

05:32.567 --> 05:34.066
Hey, she got one.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.500
Ma, please, no jokes.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.734
Hey, pussycat, we all deal
with this in our own way.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.333
Some people make
nervous little jokes.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.033
Some people cry.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.133
Remember how you went
to the maternity ward?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.533
Gee, I'd forgotten that.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.000
What about the maternity ward?

05:51.066 --> 05:53.800
When Dorothy's father
was sick in the hospital,

05:53.867 --> 05:56.900
she and I would visit
the maternity ward.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.233
The night Sal died,

05:58.300 --> 06:01.066
I went looking for Dorothy
and found her there.

06:01.133 --> 06:04.633
They were just putting
a newborn in his bassinet.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.567
I thought, "That baby must have
been born just as Sal died."

06:08.633 --> 06:10.834
He even looked like Sal.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.834
Of course, all babies look like Sal,

06:13.900 --> 06:16.033
especially when
he took out his teeth.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.967
Oh, God. I miss that man.

06:20.033 --> 06:21.467
Me too, Ma.

06:21.533 --> 06:23.166
Then the strangest
thing happened.

06:23.233 --> 06:27.100
They put the baby's last name
in the window, Rheingold.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.900
Why was that so strange?

06:28.967 --> 06:32.300
Rheingold was Sal's favorite beer.

06:32.367 --> 06:35.233
He was always walking around the
apartment singing that damn jingle,

06:35.300 --> 06:38.500
<i>"My beer is Rheingold,</i>
<i>The dry beer."</i>

06:38.567 --> 06:43.266
<i>♪ Think of Rheingold</i>
<i>Whenever you buy beer ♪</i>

06:43.333 --> 06:45.133
<i>♪ It's not bitter, not sweet ♪</i>

06:45.200 --> 06:47.400
<i>♪ It's the extra dry treat ♪</i>

06:47.467 --> 06:53.600
<i>♪ Won't you try extra dry</i>
<i>Rheingold beer? ♪</i>

06:53.667 --> 06:56.533
I'm glad to see my mother's illness
hasn't upset you.

06:57.467 --> 06:58.667
Look, Kirsten--

06:58.734 --> 07:00.867
Look, just never mind.
How's my mother?

07:01.367 --> 07:05.200
We don't know. She's in ICU,
waiting for the surgeon.

07:05.266 --> 07:07.734
-Speak to the nurses.
-We'll come with you.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.633
Oh, no. Just continue
with your little sing-along.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.633
-Kirsten, listen.
-Leave her alone. She's scared.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.100
I'm scared too.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.133
Why does it always have to take
something like this

07:18.200 --> 07:21.567
to make us realize how much
we take life for granted?

07:21.633 --> 07:23.667
Oh, amen to that.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.800
I used to, but not anymore.

07:25.867 --> 07:28.800
Hell, at my age, you can't
take lunch for granted.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.500
I had a tuna fish sandwich.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.900
It was beautiful.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.934
Well, Rose never takes
anything for granted.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.133
She's never afraid
to try something new.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.367
You remember the time
she took that playwriting course?

07:46.433 --> 07:47.800
Oh, God.

07:47.867 --> 07:51.467
She turned "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
into a musical.

07:51.533 --> 07:54.100
Don't laugh, Blanche
was terrific as Mary.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.967
And I made a pretty good lamb

07:56.033 --> 07:58.200
even though my knees were
killing me for weeks.

07:58.266 --> 08:00.100
Dorothy's performance
stole the show.

08:00.166 --> 08:04.333
How could you <i>not</i>

08:04.400 --> 08:06.700

08:06.767 --> 08:09.266

08:14.633 --> 08:16.633
Really glad you're having
such a good time.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.200
This looks a little strange,
but it isn't.

08:20.266 --> 08:23.266
I don't care. I'm thinking
about my mother now.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.533
Find out anything?

08:24.600 --> 08:28.200
The doctor's coming out
to talk to me soon.

08:28.266 --> 08:30.300
I don't understand
how this can be happening.

08:30.367 --> 08:33.600
My mother was
the healthiest person I knew.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.967
Ever since she moved in
with you guys,

08:36.033 --> 08:38.567
I don't understand
what her life's like anymore.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.567
She's always out with the girls.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.700
And there's always
these weird things.

08:42.767 --> 08:45.066
Like, one time
I pulled into your driveway

08:45.133 --> 08:47.133
and you were dressed
in a petticoat,

08:47.200 --> 08:48.400
you were dressed like a lamb,

08:48.467 --> 08:51.533
and you were both getting in
the car with a big scary dog.

08:52.934 --> 08:54.233
Wolf.

08:57.734 --> 08:59.667
I was a wolf.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.700
Your mother
was just having fun.

09:06.767 --> 09:10.100
All this fun's killing her.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.834
I wish she'd moved in with me
when I asked her to.

09:12.900 --> 09:17.033
You're just upset. We all are,
but you have to know,

09:17.100 --> 09:19.500
these two women
love her like a sister.

09:19.567 --> 09:21.734
I love your mother
like she was my own.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.900
You're forgetting
one thing though.

09:23.967 --> 09:26.300
I'm her daughter.
You're not her family.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.834
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

09:28.900 --> 09:33.266
-We share our lives together.
-You share a house together.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.567
-Kirsten Adams?
-Yes.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.300
I'm Dr. Shrewsbury.

09:37.367 --> 09:40.133
How's my mother?
Is she going to be ok?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.600
Your mother has
to have a triple bypass.

09:46.567 --> 09:48.266
When can we see her, doctor?

09:48.333 --> 09:49.667
Are you related to the patient?

09:49.734 --> 09:51.667
They're not.

09:51.734 --> 09:52.834
Well, I'm sorry.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.867
Only relatives
can see the patient.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.333
This is a very serious operation

09:58.400 --> 10:01.100
but we are gonna do
the best that we can.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.333
Okay, can I see my mother first?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.734
Oh, of course.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.400
Oh, my God.

10:08.467 --> 10:12.367
Rose is gonna have
a triple bypass?

10:12.433 --> 10:14.200
Well, she needs us.

10:14.266 --> 10:16.900
She's going into surgery soon.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.300
We just sedated her,

10:18.367 --> 10:20.667
and in a few seconds,
she may not be coherent,

10:20.734 --> 10:22.333
so please keep it brief.

10:27.266 --> 10:30.700
Mom? Mom, it's me.

10:30.767 --> 10:33.300
Oh, Kirsten,
I'm so glad you came.

10:33.367 --> 10:37.100
Oh, don't worry, Mom.
Everything's going to be ok.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.266
Kirsten, where are the girls?

10:40.333 --> 10:43.166
Oh, they're too young
to come to the hospital.

10:43.233 --> 10:46.367
Not your girls, my girls.

10:46.433 --> 10:49.200
My girls aren't
too young for anything.

10:49.266 --> 10:53.233
Well... they're waiting outside.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.700
Why don't you relax?
We don't have to talk.

10:55.767 --> 10:58.633
No. I'm fine.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.900
Listen, I want you
to do me a favor.

11:01.967 --> 11:03.133
Anything.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.433
If something happens,

11:06.500 --> 11:11.934
I want you to look after Dorothy
and Blanche and Sophia for me.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.033
Sure, mom.
Whatever you want.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.867
And there's something else
I want to tell you.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.734
Now lean in close.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.400
This is very important.

11:23.467 --> 11:27.467
Live from New York,
it's Saturday night!

11:36.900 --> 11:39.800
Wow. This stuff
really packs a wallop.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.867
Mom...
Mom, listen to me.

11:44.934 --> 11:48.000
You have to promise me
you're going to be ok.

11:48.066 --> 11:49.767
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.300
I want you to be around
for a long time.

11:52.367 --> 11:56.233
Oh, don't be worry, sweetheart.
I'll be around.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.633
I'm going to have my head frozen.

12:00.300 --> 12:04.000
So are Dorothy
and Blanche and Sophia.

12:04.066 --> 12:06.700
And someday,
they'll find a cure,

12:06.767 --> 12:08.900
and then they'll unfreeze us.

12:08.967 --> 12:11.433
Isn't that a good idea, Kristen?

12:11.500 --> 12:13.667
How much of this stuff
did you give her?

12:15.333 --> 12:18.667
How are you feeling, Mrs. Nylund?
You ready to go?

12:18.734 --> 12:22.734
That's a good question,
Mr. Carson,

12:22.800 --> 12:26.967
but first I'd like to sing a number
from my new album.

12:28.567 --> 12:31.367
Yep. She's ready.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.633
We're going to do
everything that we can.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.834
-Thank you.
-Wait just a second.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.000
Come here, Kristen.

12:38.066 --> 12:39.800
Kiss me goodbye.

12:39.867 --> 12:43.266
Mom, don't say that.
Everything's going to be fine.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.667
Come here
and kiss mommy goodbye.

12:48.767 --> 12:53.567
(sad music playing)

12:59.266 --> 13:03.500
(soft music playing)

13:07.200 --> 13:08.600
My Heinie's asleep.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.600
Fine. We'll keep
our voices down.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.533
It's a beautiful thing
you two have together.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.633
What?

13:21.700 --> 13:26.300
You and Sophia are the closest
mother and daughter I ever knew.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.834
I wish I'd had that
with my mother.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.266
You know, when she died,

13:31.333 --> 13:36.433
I got to the hospital
too late to say goodbye,

13:36.500 --> 13:38.367
and now I'm not going
to get to say goodbye.

13:38.433 --> 13:40.033
Stop it, Blanche.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.233
Rose can beat this.

13:41.300 --> 13:44.066
Hell, if I can beat it, she can.
You know how I know?

13:44.133 --> 13:47.433
Because she's strong.
Strong like me.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.967
Oh, oh, oh...

13:50.033 --> 13:51.567
oh.

13:51.633 --> 13:56.400
That's right. You went through heart
surgery too, didn't you, Sophia?

13:56.467 --> 14:00.333
No. I take nitroglycerin
because I want to explode.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.200
Here you are.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.800
When you weren't at home, I figured
something was wrong with Rose.

14:05.867 --> 14:06.967
Is she ok?

14:07.033 --> 14:09.133
She's having
open heart surgery.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.200
Oh, no.

14:11.266 --> 14:15.266
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-Come on, I'll take you.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.600
Bring back some of those
paper seat covers.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.667
Hey, you collect stamps.

14:24.633 --> 14:30.834
(calm music playing)

14:30.900 --> 14:36.166
Kirsten, Kristen...
what's going on?

14:36.233 --> 14:39.467
Well, they just brought my
mother out of surgery, and she...

14:41.967 --> 14:44.266
well, she doesn't look so good.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.567
When can we see her?

14:45.633 --> 14:48.100
That wouldn't be
a good idea right now.

14:48.166 --> 14:50.567
What did the doctor say?

14:50.633 --> 14:52.934
He said that the next
few hours were crucial

14:53.000 --> 14:56.400
and that even
if she makes it,

14:56.467 --> 14:58.767
she may need a lot
of physical therapy,

14:58.834 --> 15:02.166
and her insurance
doesn't really cover that.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.133
I don't know what
we're going to do.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.500
Don't worry about that.

15:06.567 --> 15:10.367
If Rose needs physical therapy,
we'll see that she gets it.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.467
That's why houses
have mortgages.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.800
-You'd do that for her?
-Of course.

15:15.867 --> 15:19.967
We made a pact that if anything
happened to one of us,

15:20.033 --> 15:22.567
the other three
would take care of her.

15:22.633 --> 15:25.400
It's an extra insurance policy.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.133
Oh, she's very lucky
to have all of you.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.100
Honey, she's very lucky
to have you too.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.367
-No, she's not.
-Oh, come on.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.166
Stop. Your mother
loves you very much.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.800
Last week, she was saying
how much she missed you.

15:39.867 --> 15:43.033
Sometimes mothers
and daughters drift apart.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.400
Dorothy and I did.

15:44.467 --> 15:46.200
I put her away.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.467
She sure did.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.800
Sometimes it takes something like
this to bring you together again.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.266
You've got to be strong for her.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.600
She needs you.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.633
I think she needs you, too.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.500
Where are you going, Kristen?

16:08.567 --> 16:11.600
I'm going to go talk
to the doctor about you.

16:11.667 --> 16:14.734
I think my mother needs
to be with her family now...

16:15.567 --> 16:17.066
all of her family.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.533
(serene music playing)

16:23.500 --> 16:27.500
You can only stay a few minutes,
and please, keep it down.

16:27.567 --> 16:29.900
Don't worry, doctor.
Thank you.

16:31.734 --> 16:34.367
Oh, God, Dorothy.
Look at her.

16:34.433 --> 16:37.200
It's the surgery. Nobody looks
good after surgery.

16:37.266 --> 16:38.900
Tell that to Cher.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.033
Please, Ma, not now.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.567
You're wrong.
I know Rose can hear us.

16:45.633 --> 16:48.200
If we act like it's over,
she will too.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.000
Don't worry, kiddo.

16:51.066 --> 16:52.433
We're all here.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.000
You're going to be fine.

16:55.066 --> 16:57.400
Dorothy is here.
Blanche is here.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.767
She wants you out of the bed
so she can use it.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.600
There's a cute doctor
she's got her eye on.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.400
God, where is she?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.200
Where is Rose now?

17:18.266 --> 17:19.467
Aah!

17:20.867 --> 17:23.200
-Aah, Rose!
-Blanche!

17:23.266 --> 17:25.834
Dorothy!
We're heads!

17:25.900 --> 17:29.367
-We're heads!
-We're heads!

17:29.433 --> 17:31.734
Wait! Wait a minute!
Calm down!

17:31.800 --> 17:34.734
Calm down.
Calm down, everybody.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.233
How did this happen?

17:36.300 --> 17:37.800
I remember.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.700
That moron made us promise

17:39.767 --> 17:42.500
we'd have our heads frozen
and meet 100 years later.

17:42.567 --> 17:44.166
And we did it?

17:45.233 --> 17:49.533
I thought they'd have
given us bodies by now.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.066
What the hell made you think

17:51.133 --> 17:54.700
people would be lining up
to donate their bodies?

17:55.633 --> 17:58.667
God, we look like a reunion
of Henry XIII's Wives.

17:58.734 --> 17:59.900
Ooh...

18:02.233 --> 18:03.600
Come on, Dorothy.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.800
Look on the bright side
for a change.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.467
Ok.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.567
Blanche, you've lost weight.

18:11.667 --> 18:14.400
Rose Nylund,
I could just strangle you.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.967
With what?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.533
Come on now.
Let's not fight.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.800
We went through
all this trouble to be together.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.667
The least we can do is enjoy it.

18:23.734 --> 18:25.500
You're right.

18:25.567 --> 18:27.667
-Fine.
-Of course.

18:27.734 --> 18:28.900
But we're heads!

18:28.967 --> 18:30.066
-We're heads!
-We're heads!

18:30.133 --> 18:31.367
We're heads!
Oh, God!

18:31.433 --> 18:33.100
We're heads!

18:33.166 --> 18:38.400
Oh, now, calm down. Calm down.
Look, everybody calm down.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.834
So, Blanche, how did you die?

18:41.900 --> 18:47.233
I was 92 years old and met
this cute tennis instructor.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.934
I told him I needed lessons.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.266
He came to the house.
I was in the bathtub.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.367
I asked if he would mind
sponging off my back.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.166
He said sure,

18:58.233 --> 19:00.900
so I waited a while
before I made my move.

19:00.967 --> 19:03.266
This is disgusting.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.633
I mean, right up
until the end, you--

19:05.700 --> 19:10.667
My final words were, "Thank you,
baby, glub, glub, glub."

19:13.100 --> 19:15.033
How did you die, Dorothy?

19:15.100 --> 19:18.734
Well, you know that sign
at the gorilla cage

19:18.800 --> 19:21.200
at the zoo,
"Do not lean over the fence"?

19:21.266 --> 19:22.500
Yeah.

19:22.567 --> 19:23.700
They mean it.

19:25.100 --> 19:29.600
I guess you know how I died,
in that hospital.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.433
The last thing I remember,
I was talking to you

19:32.500 --> 19:36.633
and Sophia and...
hey, where's Sophia?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.800
Didn't she have
her head frozen too?

19:38.867 --> 19:41.734
I guess not. Oh, poor ma.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.700
Instead of being here with us,

19:43.767 --> 19:50.000
she's all alone in some dark,
cold box 6 feet under.

19:50.066 --> 19:51.467
Sorry I'm late.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.467
Dorothy, chin up.
Posture's important.

19:58.934 --> 20:01.200
God, she's alive.

20:01.266 --> 20:04.533
I sold that video of you
falling into the gorilla pit

20:04.600 --> 20:06.467
to <i>America's funniest home videos.</i>

20:06.533 --> 20:10.300
-Ma, how could you?
-I won.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.867
It was a lot funnier
with the sound effects.

20:12.934 --> 20:14.934
Boink, boink,
boink, boink.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.367
Doing!

20:17.433 --> 20:21.033
How can you still be alive?
You have to be 200.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.333
I died. I had my head frozen.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.266
But how did you get a body so fast?

20:26.333 --> 20:28.467
-You didn't tip the guy?
-Oh.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.867
At least that proves
they can do it.

20:33.934 --> 20:36.200
How do you like
your new body?

20:36.266 --> 20:40.166
I've got the body of a 25-year-old,
and I'm in luck.

20:40.233 --> 20:43.734
The in thing now is young bodies
with old heads.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.667
Ugh!

20:47.800 --> 20:51.633
Rose, this stinks.
This really stinks.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.200
It's all my fault.

20:53.266 --> 20:56.533
If I hadn't made you promise,
this never would have happened.

20:56.600 --> 21:01.300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.600
-I'm sorry.
-She's talking.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.867
-I'm sorry.
-What is it, Rose?

21:05.934 --> 21:08.467
-I'm sorry I died.
-Oh.

21:08.533 --> 21:13.467
No, Rose, you didn't,
and, honey, we're all here,

21:13.533 --> 21:16.033
ma, Blanche, me.

21:16.100 --> 21:21.233
Oh, girls,
I had the most wonderful dream.

21:21.300 --> 21:25.667
Sophia, you had
the body of a 25-year-old...

21:27.133 --> 21:31.133
and, Blanche, you were
having sex till you were 92.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.233
Ooh.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.400
And, Dorothy, you...

21:36.934 --> 21:40.834
well, you met somebody who
couldn't keep his hands off you.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.967
Maybe we ought to let you
rest, honey.

21:46.033 --> 21:47.600
Oh, don't go.

21:47.667 --> 21:50.800
Seeing you all here
makes me know I'm alive.

21:50.867 --> 21:52.266
It's a miracle.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.066
Oh, yes, it is.

21:54.133 --> 21:56.367
Dorothy finally met somebody.

21:59.066 --> 22:02.400
(serene music playing)

22:04.867 --> 22:05.967
Are you ready?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.700
-Rose and Kristen just pulled up.
-Let's hide.

22:08.767 --> 22:11.500
Wait. You really think
it's such a great idea

22:11.567 --> 22:15.233
to scream "surprise" at someone
who just had heart surgery?

22:19.033 --> 22:20.700
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

22:22.867 --> 22:24.133
For who?

22:25.633 --> 22:26.967
For you.

22:29.300 --> 22:33.433
-Oh, honey, how are you feeling?
-Oh, I'm fine.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.867
We're just so glad
to have you back.

22:35.934 --> 22:38.767
I couldn't have
done it without you.

22:38.834 --> 22:41.100
-Where's Sophia?
-In the kitchen.

22:41.166 --> 22:44.767
She has a surprise.

22:49.066 --> 22:50.867
Hey, look who's back.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.467
Oh, no!

22:55.200 --> 22:57.600
What, you never dropped
a knife before?

22:57.667 --> 23:00.700
-Welcome back, baby.
-Oh, sweetie.

23:00.767 --> 23:02.433
Oh...

23:10.033 --> 23:14.467
(theme music playing)
