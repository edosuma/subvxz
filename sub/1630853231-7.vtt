WEBVTT

00:23.482 --> 00:26.276
Of course,
the title is a nod to the place.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.237
But more specifically,

00:28.820 --> 00:31.990
it's a nod to the immigrant women
who make America,

00:32.073 --> 00:35.285
as told through the textiles
from their country of origin.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.705
Women… like my mother right here.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.877
Can you tell us a bit more

00:43.961 --> 00:46.421
about the sourcing of the materials
for this piece in particular?

00:46.505 --> 00:48.674
Yeah. We imported
them from all over the world.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.467
It's all surrounding…

01:00.644 --> 01:02.980
You spent more time talking
to that security man

01:03.063 --> 01:04.730
than you did to Sareena and her friends.

01:04.815 --> 01:08.151
Maurice, from Senegal. Nice man.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.320
I'm so ashamed of your behavior.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.992
-How long do you want? Fifty seconds?
-Let's say 45.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.706
Why are you making such a problem?

01:21.290 --> 01:23.166
I am not. You are.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.963
Finally I get out of this house
to do something new

01:28.046 --> 01:30.465
and meet new people, but no.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.802
No! Instead, we come home
when you want to come home

01:33.886 --> 01:37.931
to do the same old,
same old bloody, darn thing.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.601
You didn't have to leave.
You could have taken a cab home.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.897
Here. Take it.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.567
And tell me if it's not warm enough.

01:49.985 --> 01:55.657
It's fine. Geez.
I don't know what's gotten into you.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.243
This is beyond ridiculous.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.663
I'll need a fork, darling.

02:06.251 --> 02:10.172
Happy birthday to you

02:12.090 --> 02:14.301
May you have a long and happy life, Anu.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.345
May the gods bless you and bless Vikas,

02:16.428 --> 02:18.805
and give you many, many,
many more years of--

02:20.140 --> 02:21.308
Arre, Anu, are you crying?

02:21.391 --> 02:22.392
No.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.188
Don't be upset because
you're getting old. We all are.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.065
-Yeah. Yes!
-Yes. Look at Nalini.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.360
Used to be so beautiful,
now looking so tired.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.195
Doctor says I'm anemic.

02:33.278 --> 02:37.449
No, it's Vik.
I've really had it with him.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.536
-Come on.
-Goodness gracious.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.454
-Manu is on these apps.
-I don't know what…

02:42.538 --> 02:43.956
He's making this sound.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.834
No, no.
I am serious this time.

02:49.837 --> 02:55.050
Last night at her artist show,
I saw my Sareena living her life so free.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.262
And then of course, Vik made us
come home early for no reason.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.013
I serve him dinner, and it's--

03:00.514 --> 03:06.228
it's just the same routine day in,
day out, and I feel so trapped.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.479
Yes, but what is marriage

03:07.563 --> 03:10.566
if not an agreement for two people
to be trapped together?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.651
But did I know that?

03:13.235 --> 03:16.196
I got married without even knowing
what it would be like.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.866
I was so young, so stupid.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.660
We all did. That's just what was done.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.204
What to do now but endure it?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.915
Shall we order, then?

03:26.999 --> 03:29.501
But, Pushpa, no,
I don't wanna just endure it.

03:29.585 --> 03:34.173
I wanna be happy,
and Vik is… holding me back.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.632
Arre, from what?

03:36.258 --> 03:38.427
What grand old thing
you think you're missing?

03:46.059 --> 03:51.023
I'm 60 years old, and all I do
is attend to his needs,

03:51.690 --> 03:53.525
and he never attends to any of mine.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.862
And I know it doesn't have to be this way.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.282
You could return him.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.285
-What?
-Udaya,

04:03.368 --> 04:05.120
what rubbish are you saying?

04:05.204 --> 04:07.539
In America,
if you don't like your husband,

04:07.623 --> 04:10.834
simply exchange him and get a new husband.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.545
No. This will not do.

04:13.629 --> 04:19.593
All I'm saying is, if you're not happy,
Anu, make yourself happy.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.053
Happy, happy?

04:21.553 --> 04:23.639
Nowadays people care too much about that.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.433
Life isn't all about happiness.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.560
Life is about enduring hard things.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.980
Now can we please order some food

04:32.064 --> 04:33.607
before I collapse from starvation?

04:34.107 --> 04:37.653
My stomach is making gurra, gurra, gurra.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.155
Excuse me? We're ready here.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.783
Can I please order for everyone?
It'll be quicker.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.469
And what's the reason
for your return today?

05:45.554 --> 05:46.555
The reason?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.891
Yes, ma'am. What's the reason
for returning your husband?

05:51.894 --> 05:53.145
Where to start?

05:55.564 --> 06:00.068
Yeah, I guess it boils down to me
looking at the next 20 years of my life,

06:00.152 --> 06:02.988
God willing,
and wanting something different.

06:04.072 --> 06:09.786
From me. Just say it.
You want something different from me.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.916
Our options are: "does not fit,"
"manufacturing defect," "arrived late,"

06:13.999 --> 06:15.417
"arrived damaged," "not suitable."

06:15.501 --> 06:17.377
Just say "not suitable"…

06:19.254 --> 06:20.255
anymore.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.675
Yeah, I also have this.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.971
Don't know if you need the--
What's it called, the husband's warranty?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.765
Oh, yes. Thanks.

06:30.933 --> 06:34.228
Wow. Thirty-seven years of marriage.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.064
I know it's donezo, but still,
that's quite an accomplishment,

06:37.147 --> 06:38.148
so congrats on that.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.442
Thank you.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.823
So, what now from here?

06:47.407 --> 06:51.203
Well, we'll take you,
Mr. Vikas, right here into the back,

06:51.286 --> 06:56.124
assess for pricing based on age,
quality, history, relevant skills…

06:56.208 --> 06:57.251
Okay.

06:57.334 --> 07:01.296
Don't listen to what my wife says about
my skills, because I have many skills.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.757
I know a lot about geography, I--

07:03.841 --> 07:06.760
Well, then we'll shine you up,
do any necessary refurbishments

07:06.844 --> 07:09.847
before putting you back out on the floor
for resale purposes.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.849
Back out onto the floor?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.393
Right here, our husbands section.

07:17.980 --> 07:21.650
Okay, Anu.
Well, I guess this is me.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.446
Okay. Well, thank you, Vik.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.656
All right, well…

07:33.328 --> 07:34.329
All right.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.585
I'm Ibrahim. Welcome.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.044
Hey. I'm Sal.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.504
I'm Vikas.

07:46.717 --> 07:49.511
Taking down one last number
for your exchange,

07:49.595 --> 07:51.513
and then you two
will officially be finito.

07:51.597 --> 07:55.642
Exchange? No, no.
I don't want another husband.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.479
I'm afraid I can only offer you
an in-store exchange for a husband

07:59.563 --> 08:01.398
or wife of same or lesser value.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.358
But I looked it up,
and the terms of agreement said--

08:03.442 --> 08:04.818
Unfortunately,

08:04.902 --> 08:08.363
that doesn't apply to out-of-country
purchases made before 1986.

08:21.710 --> 08:22.836
Tissue?

08:23.879 --> 08:24.880
Thank you.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.888
Do you wanna watch TV?

08:33.388 --> 08:35.097
Sure. Whatever you'd like to do.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.477
Okay. How about the news?

08:40.229 --> 08:41.522
News is just perfect.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.193
Officials noted that
if both parties are not back

08:46.276 --> 08:48.237
at the bargaining table
by early next week,

08:48.320 --> 08:50.405
chances are not good
at reaching a resolution

08:50.489 --> 08:52.741
before the self-imposed deadline arises.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.494
The spokesperson
for the striking hotel workers said today.

08:55.994 --> 09:00.123
The rank and file remains optimistic
that a new contract can be agreed upon…

09:15.347 --> 09:19.601
I wanted to be a painter before I met Vik.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.521
I think that's why I chose you.

09:24.022 --> 09:28.569
I'm flattered. You're a rad woman, you
know that?

09:34.491 --> 09:37.953
Have you always
wanted to be an artist?

09:38.036 --> 09:40.038
No. No way.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.707
Let's see.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.252
I've been a day camp counselor
and an ice cream scooper.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.547
I worked at Sears in the stockroom.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.924
I love Sears.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.178
Then in college, I did a million things.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.432
I was a campus tour guide.
I worked a zip line in Costa Rica.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.683
Long story.

10:01.852 --> 10:05.480
Spent a summer fixing office chairs.
Longer story.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.191
I did some modeling.

10:07.691 --> 10:08.901
You were a model?

10:09.568 --> 10:10.569
Briefly.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.031
What, like a fashion model?

10:29.880 --> 10:31.381
Come on, Anu. You got this.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.926
No, I don't. It's all rubbish.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.594
It's not all rubbish.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.847
Here, I'm gonna come see.

10:45.562 --> 10:50.400
This is great. It's great.
It's really, really great.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.778
Yeah. The more you say
"really, really great,"

10:52.861 --> 10:54.279
the more I know it's all lies.

10:54.363 --> 10:58.492
It is. It's an awesome first effort.
It's dynamic.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.329
Yeah, your perspective's
all at play, right?

11:02.412 --> 11:04.873
Your proportions are all happening.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.961
-It's okay, you can relax.
-I am relaxed.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.463
Really? 'Cause your shoulders
are all the way up by your ears.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.801
It's funny,
my mom's used to be like that too.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.766
Do I remind you of your mom?

11:23.767 --> 11:26.311
A little, but, like, not in a creepy way.

11:31.692 --> 11:36.238
"For me, exercise is more than physical.
It's therapeutic,"

11:37.114 --> 11:38.782
Michelle Obama.

11:39.992 --> 11:42.536
Well,
I've always wanted to get in shape.

11:44.204 --> 11:48.709
"You have to exercise or at some point,
you'll just break down,"

11:50.544 --> 11:53.547
Barack Obama, obviously. Let's go!

11:55.507 --> 11:56.925
Come on, you can do it!

11:59.219 --> 12:01.346
Five, six, seven, eight!

12:01.430 --> 12:05.017
Punch, and knee. Punch, and knee.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.895
Decide, commit, succeed.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.356
Decide, commit, succeed.

12:12.441 --> 12:16.820
Remember, good things
come to those who wait.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.701
-Come on! Move it!
-I know.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.244
Punch and punch!

12:24.328 --> 12:25.871
…which is nice,

12:26.371 --> 12:30.292
because the only place Vik ever moved
was from the kitchen to the La-Z-Boy.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.630
Raoul, are you hearing me?

12:35.672 --> 12:39.092
Anu, don't you think that's
a little too much butter on your chapati?

12:48.352 --> 12:50.229
You should have asked me.

12:50.312 --> 12:53.982
I could've told you
which fellows were the loafers.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.110
You see this poor bastard here, Anu?

12:57.736 --> 12:58.946
The one in the baseball hat?

12:59.029 --> 13:03.909
Haan. No good.
Reduced his price four times.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.285
No.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.580
No one taken you off the shelf yet?

13:08.664 --> 13:11.917
Just a lot of window shopping so far.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.712
But it's been giving me time
to see that I--

13:16.213 --> 13:19.383
I need to make, you know,
a couple changes here and there.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.261
Oh, yeah?

13:23.470 --> 13:27.933
Yeah. I've been talking a lot
with Sal and Ibrahim.

13:28.517 --> 13:31.395
Ibrahim is a family therapist by trade.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.565
Trying to figure out
where I went wrong and--

13:35.357 --> 13:38.527
and maybe what you said
when you were returning me was right.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.864
Maybe we weren't suitable
for each other anymore.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.492
I can see now that I needed
to make these, you know

13:46.577 --> 13:48.912
adjustments, and I didn't.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.915
I have been learning a lot
about myself as well.

13:51.999 --> 13:56.044
I finally realized I've been looking
in the wrong direction for happiness.

13:58.297 --> 14:00.883
-Really?
-Yeah. I need to look within.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.926
I need to figure out who I am.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.013
Being alone that will make me happy.

14:07.848 --> 14:14.313
Right, right. Maybe that is for the best.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.774
Good luck with that.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.360
Thank you, Vik.

14:22.446 --> 14:26.575
I gotta go. I will--

14:27.743 --> 14:30.162
-I'll drop in and see you next week maybe.
-All right.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.206
-Okay.
-Right.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.082
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.315
Vernazza.

15:01.568 --> 15:05.364
Bocca della Verità.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.658
Ciao bella.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.995
Spaghetti carbonara.

15:25.843 --> 15:29.471
Welcome to my humble,
blue abode.

15:29.555 --> 15:33.642
This is what
I was talking about, the front garden.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.395
I'm sure you've seen this
just a million times.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.272
I mean, you just look.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.565
Hi, Anu!

15:39.648 --> 15:41.441
Here, can you hold this for a minute?

15:41.525 --> 15:42.734
Anu, where'd you go?

15:42.818 --> 15:45.529
-Hi.
-Are you okay?

15:45.612 --> 15:48.198
It looked like you fell down.

15:48.282 --> 15:53.245
Hey, I just picked up-- Wow!
A steal of a deal at the store.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.415
Actually, I've always sorta had a crush
on him.

15:56.498 --> 16:00.794
And it was such a bargain,
I just couldn't pass it up, frankly.

16:00.878 --> 16:01.962
Is it gonna be awkward?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.882
No, come on. Not awkward at all.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.342
Good, good.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.804
Yeah, I didn't think so, because, yeah,
you're the one who returned him.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.306
Yeah, yeah. Just…

16:12.389 --> 16:14.433
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.934
You returned him.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.687
I picked him up.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.235
So, this front garden
is just kind of a washout.

16:25.319 --> 16:27.112
I think we oughta look at the back

16:27.196 --> 16:29.948
because some really good things
are happening in the back.

16:30.449 --> 16:31.575
Come on in.

16:41.752 --> 16:45.047
-Well, okay.
-That's just great.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.885
Hi, Anu.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.387
What are you doing here?

16:52.471 --> 16:53.472
Hi, Barbara.

16:53.555 --> 16:56.225
I have just been doing
some cleaning up at home

16:56.308 --> 17:02.147
and wanted to drop by this box of
Vik's old clothing in case he needs it.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.733
Well, that is just so nice of you.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.152
It's quite heavy, actually.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.819
I can come in and put it down if you like.

17:08.904 --> 17:11.365
Yeah. No. He won't be needing that.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.784
-No?
-No. Oh, no.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.078
I bought Vikas all new clothes.

17:16.662 --> 17:17.663
Vikas?

17:17.746 --> 17:18.872
-Barbie?
-Yeah?

17:18.955 --> 17:21.500
-Everything okay?
-Whoo! Looking good.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.045
Hello, Anu.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.506
Doesn't he look great?

17:30.008 --> 17:31.677
Yeah, you know what?

17:32.302 --> 17:37.099
I think that maybe we're not ready
for unannounced visits quite yet.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.183
Excuse me?

17:38.267 --> 17:40.227
I think that we need a little more time

17:40.310 --> 17:43.689
for everyone to get
used to this new normal.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.526
I knew you'd agree. Bye-bye.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.835
How you hanging in there, Mom?
What have you been up to?

18:04.918 --> 18:09.089
Well, so many things, my Saru.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.675
Let's see. Let's see.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.053
I've been doing some gardening…

18:15.137 --> 18:16.471
Okay, the next phrase,

18:16.555 --> 18:19.183
"I would like a room for two."

18:19.266 --> 18:20.267
All right.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.394
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.478
Got it?

18:23.562 --> 18:29.818
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux.

18:29.902 --> 18:32.905
Good job. We're good.

18:36.617 --> 18:39.161
…catching up on some reading…

18:48.378 --> 18:50.547
some bird watching…

18:59.056 --> 19:01.016
Well, just know I'm really proud of you.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.268
Maybe we can even go
on a double date sometime.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.729
I'm trying. Slowly, slowly.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.689
Whenever you're ready.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.567
There's this new sushi place
downtown I think you'd like.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.073
-Oh, my God. Mom, are you okay?
-I-I'll call you back.

19:16.156 --> 19:20.410
Arre. Oh, no. Barbara, are you okay?

19:20.494 --> 19:23.330
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.917
How could you not see me, Anu?
Don't you have a rearview mirror?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.377
I was distracted.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.171
You know, I'm just getting
used to this driving thing,

19:31.255 --> 19:34.258
'cause Vik used to do
all the driving when we were together.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.135
Okay. All right. Yeah.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.096
Look, at least let me help you
back into the house.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.724
I'm sure you'd love that,
wouldn't you? No, thank you. I'm fine.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.519
No! Thanks. I'm fine.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.523
Son of a gun! God, dang it.

19:50.107 --> 19:52.818
Vikas! Honey, a little help.

20:45.579 --> 20:48.248
-Anu did this.
-Come on. Okay.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.667
All right.

20:50.751 --> 20:53.378
-Can I? Thank you. All right.
-Yes. Okay, come on.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.631
You got it?

20:55.714 --> 20:58.383
-Yeah, just lean on me.
-You've got to be kidding me.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.392
Go to hell.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.720
And thank you
to all of our wonderful guests,

21:43.804 --> 21:45.597
and thank you at home for watching.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.401
-Hey, Clark.
-Anu.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.611
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

21:59.695 --> 22:01.947
Huge closeout in our
husbands aisle.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.448
No, thank you.

22:07.452 --> 22:08.453
Vik?

22:10.664 --> 22:11.957
What happened?

22:12.040 --> 22:16.795
Barbara returned me.
Said married life wasn't for her.

22:19.006 --> 22:22.217
Still wearing the jacket she gave you,
looking like a hero.

22:22.301 --> 22:25.804
I need all the help I can get, so…

22:26.972 --> 22:29.474
No, no, don't. Don't look at my price.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.935
No, Vik. This is too low!

22:32.436 --> 22:37.107
I've been returned twice, so I'm,
I'm "bargain basement" now.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.778
Come, sit. Here.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.909
Hey, want something cool to drink?

22:56.710 --> 22:58.629
Why did you change for her?

23:00.547 --> 23:01.632
What?

23:01.715 --> 23:04.885
Thirty-seven years I've done everything
for you, and you stopped doing…

23:05.636 --> 23:06.637
anything.

23:07.721 --> 23:11.850
And then you go live with Barbara,
and suddenly you're Johnny Mr. Helpful.

23:11.934 --> 23:15.854
"Look at me,
cooking for Barbara, cleaning for Barbara,

23:15.938 --> 23:19.358
brushing Barbara's graying, sh--
thinnish hair."

23:19.441 --> 23:23.111
-So, you were-- you were spying on us?
-Be quiet.

23:23.195 --> 23:26.156
It's not like I was James Bond,
shimmying up a drainpipe.

23:26.782 --> 23:29.243
-James Bond doesn't shimmy.
-You know what I mean.

23:34.790 --> 23:38.001
When we were first married, I would fix
something,

23:38.085 --> 23:41.255
and all you could say is,
"Why-- Why did you fix it like that?"

23:41.880 --> 23:43.715
Everything I did was wrong

23:43.799 --> 23:46.385
just because it wasn't done
the way you would do it.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.555
Nothing I did ever seemed to be
good enough for you, so I,

23:50.764 --> 23:51.890
so I stopped trying.

23:58.355 --> 24:03.318
All these years,
I thought the problem was you…

24:05.112 --> 24:07.114
and then I spent time alone with myself.

24:09.032 --> 24:12.828
I realized I'm not that easy either.

24:14.913 --> 24:17.624
No. You're not.

24:22.713 --> 24:25.174
So many ways
we took each other for granted.

24:30.721 --> 24:31.889
I'm sorry.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.363
So, what's next? Are you--

24:49.114 --> 24:51.116
Are you here to buy Ibrahim?

24:51.742 --> 24:53.452
No, I'm done shopping.

24:54.328 --> 24:56.288
So you're going to stay single, then?

24:57.206 --> 24:58.290
I don't know.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.468
What happened to us?

25:12.137 --> 25:15.182
Worked so bloody hard to come
to the land of plenty.

25:15.265 --> 25:19.603
And now here we are
in a store of abundance

25:19.686 --> 25:22.272
and yet left with nothing.

25:22.356 --> 25:24.608
No, not nothing.

25:25.359 --> 25:27.861
We have Sareena, our unmarried daughter

25:27.945 --> 25:30.155
who comes to visit us
for a few hours every year.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.585
If I were to buy you back,
it would have to be different.

25:43.669 --> 25:46.004
It can't go back to what we had before.

25:49.216 --> 25:50.217
Of course.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.594
I want an exciting life.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.097
And I don't know what that means

25:55.180 --> 25:58.684
and I don't know how to get it,
but I know that I want it.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.311
And I don't want you
to hold me back from it.

26:01.395 --> 26:05.148
Me too. I don-- I don't want to sit
in an armchair the rest of my life.

26:05.232 --> 26:09.069
No, I mean it, Vik. It's-- I'm not talking
about just going on a cruise.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.154
No bloody cruises. They're shit.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.909
What is this S-word you're suddenly using?

26:18.370 --> 26:19.746
I'm a new man.

26:29.464 --> 26:30.465
No.

26:34.344 --> 26:35.554
You can't buy me.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.309
I'm "bargain basement." You deserve
better.

26:56.241 --> 26:58.243
-Get in the cart.
-Why?

26:58.327 --> 27:01.580
-Get in.
-But I told you. You can't buy me.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.291
Yeah, I am not going to buy you.
I'm gonna steal you.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.461
Value this, value that. It's all rubbish.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.588
Come on. Get in before somebody sees us.

27:10.631 --> 27:14.384
Okay, but what are you doing?
You've never stolen anything in your life.

27:14.468 --> 27:16.220
Yes, that's right.

27:16.303 --> 27:19.556
But what, what if you want to return me?
You don't have a receipt.

27:20.933 --> 27:22.351
I'm not returning you.

27:26.021 --> 27:27.731
All right, go. Go.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.025
Go.

27:48.085 --> 27:49.378
Go, go.
