<i> Narrator:</i>
<i> What makes this artifact</i>

04:36.168 --> 04:40.279
<i> So intriguing is that it was</i>
<i> found on lot 7,</i>

04:40.430 --> 04:44.283
<i> Near the border of lot 8 on</i>
<i>the western side of the island.</i>

04:44.510 --> 04:48.102

<i> A semi-precious</i>

<i> To sacred treasures</i>
<i> of the knights templar.</i>

04:56.463 --> 05:00.299
<i>And just this year,</i>
<i>it is where they also discovered</i>

05:00.526 --> 05:03.860
<i> A bunk hook designed</i>
<i> for lifting heavy cargo,</i>

05:03.879 --> 05:06.471
<i> As well as a possible coin</i>

05:06.698 --> 05:10.033
<i> Potentially</i>
<i> predating the 16th century.</i>

05:10.126 --> 05:12.052
You know, the first thing
that strikes me

05:12.146 --> 05:17.298
Is that it's a ferrous metal
around the adornment item.

05:17.318 --> 05:21.211
And this lip coming over the
edge, that might indicate

05:21.304 --> 05:24.230
A little hinged something
or cover to it, perhaps.

05:24.383 --> 05:26.307
Yeah, that's what piqued
my interest as well,

05:26.327 --> 05:30.053
Because that so reminds me
of an old-style setting.

05:30.146 --> 05:32.556
Schneirla:
Yeah, so, I would have to think

05:32.649 --> 05:35.241
That it's some kind of a pin.

05:35.394 --> 05:36.910
Yep.

05:37.004 --> 05:37.836
The material is glass.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.729
Hmm.

05:39.748 --> 05:41.506
I don't know whether that's

05:41.658 --> 05:44.584
On a metal backing,
which is known as a foil back,

05:44.736 --> 05:46.419
Or there's actually

05:46.572 --> 05:48.088
A colorant on the back
of the cab itself.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.848
But, you know,

05:50.075 --> 05:52.258
Glass has been used
as an imitation of gemstones

05:52.353 --> 05:54.019
Since the roman times.

05:54.246 --> 05:57.022
The other thing that
I will mention is that,

05:57.173 --> 06:01.342
Having looked at a lot
of jewelry from all periods,

06:01.362 --> 06:05.197
From all over the world, I've
never seen a mounting like that.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.868
It's definitely not usa.

06:10.019 --> 06:13.263
What you're telling us
is absolutely, bloody fantastic.

06:13.356 --> 06:14.447
This has got
an old feel about it.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.282
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

<i>Narrator:</i>

-I mean, this is gorgeous.
-Beautiful.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.878
So, if you look at
that dark, round sphere

06:36.897 --> 06:40.624
Up there in
the two o'clock position,

06:40.642 --> 06:43.960
You can see that's
an air bubble, gas bubble.

06:43.979 --> 06:46.905
Which does not occur
in any gem material,

06:47.132 --> 06:50.150
Except for amber
and only on rare occasion.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.077
So, that's another

06:52.228 --> 06:53.561
Indicator that it's glass.

07:03.072 --> 07:05.165

07:05.259 --> 07:07.909

-Thank you.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.891

09:36.910 --> 09:38.225
-55?
-Yeah.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.969

of her.

completely?

09:45.827 --> 09:47.068

-It happened at 60 feet.

28:21.850 --> 28:24.368
Jack and I found
a really interesting artifact.

28:24.519 --> 28:27.763
What looks like
a piece of copper.

28:27.781 --> 28:31.357
And the metals came back
as, like, an older mix.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.937
So, we're hoping you can shed
some light on this artifact,

28:34.955 --> 28:37.030
And I'm hoping it's a coin.

28:37.124 --> 28:39.699
-Okay, let's have a look.
-Okay.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.059
<i> Which archaeologist</i>
<i> emma culligan believes</i>

28:49.211 --> 28:52.545
<i> Could date back to</i>
<i> the 16th century or earlier.</i>

28:52.565 --> 28:56.458
Sandy:
It's not
a traditional shape,

28:56.477 --> 28:58.736
But anything is possible.

29:02.132 --> 29:05.576
I'm not seeing
any detail at all.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.154
And it's tapered.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.231
Gary:
Yeah.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.565
Sandy:
Usually, a tell-tale
that it's, you know,

29:12.659 --> 29:13.751
Probably not a coin.

29:15.329 --> 29:18.756
It could be a barter piece,
it could be...

29:18.907 --> 29:22.926
Do you mean like a,
like a trade token type thing?

29:23.153 --> 29:24.669
Well, I mean,
anything made out of metal

29:24.822 --> 29:26.321
Was used for barter, right?

29:26.414 --> 29:28.006
-Yeah.
-And that's where coins

29:28.158 --> 29:31.660
Derived from, you know,
producing, you know,

29:31.678 --> 29:33.937
Something that
was easily transferred

29:34.164 --> 29:36.498
That was made out of
copper, silver, or gold.

29:36.591 --> 29:38.942
This would be no different.

29:39.094 --> 29:41.779
Let's weigh it and see where
it fits in on a scale.

29:41.930 --> 29:44.856
If it was some
kind of trade piece,

29:45.009 --> 29:46.599
What would be
the weight on it?

29:46.619 --> 29:48.768
It'll be in increments
of grams, normally,

29:48.788 --> 29:50.788
So...

29:52.699 --> 29:55.350
And this piece is four grams
right on the button.

29:55.369 --> 29:58.537
What's unusual is, you know,

29:58.689 --> 30:02.024
It's sort of an
exact weight of four grams.

30:02.042 --> 30:04.209
And it's very puzzling,

30:04.361 --> 30:06.862
The way the edges
are done on this.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.197
Someone took a lot of time,

30:09.216 --> 30:12.125
Probably, making that
four grams, and it's...

30:12.144 --> 30:13.535
Yeah, I mean,
potentially,

30:13.628 --> 30:15.370
It is, you know,
potentially

30:15.463 --> 30:17.797
A barter piece
that would have

30:17.817 --> 30:20.709
Value for that amount
of copper at the time, right?

30:20.802 --> 30:23.469
So, it would have
monetary value.

30:23.564 --> 30:25.138
Gary:
How old is it?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.990
It's 500 years old, at least.

30:27.217 --> 30:29.159
Wow.

30:29.386 --> 30:32.737
To date it more accurately
would be really tough,

30:32.890 --> 30:35.057
But because of the composition,
it's definitely

30:35.075 --> 30:37.150
That period or earlier.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.003
It's absolutely
brilliant news, mate.

30:40.230 --> 30:43.565
-I mean, this is fantastic.
-Yeah.

30:43.584 --> 30:45.417
Charles:
When you mentioned,
you know, the 1500s,

30:45.569 --> 30:47.903
My mind immediately
went to the portuguese.

30:47.921 --> 30:49.404
I mean, they were
incredible seafarers.

30:49.497 --> 30:50.906
They went all over the world.

30:50.924 --> 30:52.665
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:19.027 --> 31:22.212
You know, more
research is needed.

31:22.364 --> 31:23.714
Definitely, and I'm going to
share this news with the guys.

Gary, what's
with the grin, buddy?

32:02.663 --> 32:05.071
Some great news
from sandy campbell,

32:05.090 --> 32:06.423
The coin expert.

32:06.574 --> 32:08.150
It was about this artifact

32:08.168 --> 32:10.510
That jack and I
recovered on lot 7.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.488
It's arsenical bronze.

32:13.581 --> 32:16.174
I was adamant it
was some kind of coin.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.160
Now, it isn't a coin,

32:18.253 --> 32:20.679
But I'm definitely
not disappointed,

32:20.831 --> 32:22.439
Because according to sandy,

32:22.590 --> 32:25.442
It's a trade
or a barter piece.

32:26.853 --> 32:28.336
Pass that around, mate.

32:28.355 --> 32:30.839
The weight on it is four grams,

32:30.932 --> 32:32.950
So it'd have been
used like currency.

32:33.101 --> 32:35.118
-It's a trade piece, though.
-Yep.

32:35.270 --> 32:36.620
Marty:
It's coin-like.

32:36.847 --> 32:38.513
It's just not
government issued, right?

32:38.606 --> 32:39.864
It would have been some
merchant or something.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.291
Gary:
Yep.

32:41.443 --> 32:42.867
Arsenic, that's
an older method.

32:42.962 --> 32:47.297
That mixture went out of
style in the early 1500s.

32:47.524 --> 32:51.301
Doug:
The archaeological record
shows that it was

32:51.528 --> 32:54.972
Used as far back as
the fifth millennium bc.

32:55.123 --> 32:57.048
(chuckles)

32:57.201 --> 32:59.977
So, it's either old
or it's really old.

33:02.039 --> 33:03.705

your comment, doug.

or really, really old.

33:06.710 --> 33:08.393

The question is,
what is it doing here?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.470

33:25.504 --> 33:27.412

Well done--
but there is something

33:40.019 --> 33:41.852
We want to tell you,
because it's a little bit

33:42.003 --> 33:44.187
Romantic in a sense, about
what we might do this year.

-You'll like it a lot, charles.

33:46.917 --> 33:49.601
Doug, why don't you
take this over here?

33:49.695 --> 33:52.696
Yeah, there's a canadian mining
company by the name of dumas.

33:52.923 --> 33:55.106
We've been in initial
discussions with them.

33:55.259 --> 33:57.108

that they could come in

37:17.885 --> 37:20.144
In that shaft

37:20.239 --> 37:22.313
-Yep.
-Marty: Wow.

37:22.466 --> 37:24.074
This is really cool.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.564
<i> Marty: Are we,</i>

37:31.583 --> 37:33.083
Going to be able

37:33.234 --> 37:35.568
In that shaft

37:35.587 --> 37:36.828
<i> -Cameron: Yep.</i>
-Marty: Brilliant.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.146
Rick:
That sounds perfect.

37:38.239 --> 37:40.315
<i> Narrator:</i>

37:46.823 --> 37:49.491
So, as we descend
into the garden shaft,

37:49.584 --> 37:51.268
<i> We can guide you</i>
<i> and bring you</i>

37:51.419 --> 37:53.919
<i> -Down into the excavation.</i>
-Okay.

37:54.014 --> 37:55.755
Doug:
I think the chance to
come down and explore

37:55.774 --> 37:59.109
That shaft is, is one
of the most important things.

37:59.336 --> 38:01.185
Yep.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.262
Steve g.:
We've encountered
what we deem to be

38:03.356 --> 38:05.690
Potential offset chambers

38:05.842 --> 38:07.859
Or voids in the ground,
so we're starting to

38:08.011 --> 38:09.602
Collect some
data for you guys

38:09.696 --> 38:11.513
And maybe give
you some targets.

38:11.531 --> 38:13.773
<i> Cameron: That's fantastic</i>

38:13.867 --> 38:15.292
<i> To be probe drilling,</i>

38:15.519 --> 38:17.368
<i> As we descend</i>
<i> into the shaft,</i>

38:17.462 --> 38:20.705
To recognize and quantify
where those voids exist.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.857
Marty:
Okay. All right.

38:22.876 --> 38:24.467
Let's say we hit something,
a void, whatever.

38:24.694 --> 38:26.970
Something at, say,
I don't know, 50 feet,

38:27.121 --> 38:28.863
And we want
to tunnel out from there.

38:28.882 --> 38:30.882
Would we be able to do that?

38:31.034 --> 38:32.884
<i>To answer your question, marty,</i>

38:32.978 --> 38:35.386
We can go in any direction,
at any elevation.

38:35.539 --> 38:37.555
Okay, that's great.

38:37.707 --> 38:39.799
Really cool.

38:46.049 --> 38:48.474
<i> Representatives from</i>
<i> dumas will construct</i>

38:48.568 --> 38:52.554
<i> A concrete foundation around</i>

39:09.997 --> 39:12.090
<i> Rick:</i>
<i> The garden shaft</i>

39:12.242 --> 39:14.351
<i> Several unique opportunities.</i>

39:14.502 --> 39:17.412
<i> You can either tunnel</i>
<i> or expand the shaft.</i>

39:17.430 --> 39:19.097
<i> You can go</i>
<i> deeper with the shaft.</i>

39:19.191 --> 39:21.249
To me, it's always about

39:21.342 --> 39:22.917
The eyes and boots approach.

39:23.010 --> 39:24.861
And we will
have a legitimate,

For the first time,
eyes and boots

39:26.940 --> 39:28.698
Approach to the money pit.

39:28.925 --> 39:31.684
From start to finish,
what's the estimated

39:31.778 --> 39:33.703
Time to completion?

39:33.930 --> 39:35.430
<i> Cameron:</i>
<i> Right now,</i>
<i> we're forecasting</i>

39:35.448 --> 39:37.782
Approximately 50 days

Rehabilitation
work to get us

39:39.861 --> 39:42.453
-To 77 and a half feet.
-Perfect.

39:42.606 --> 39:45.123
We've never
been able to go underground

39:45.275 --> 39:46.958
In the money pit,
and yet everyone before us

39:47.052 --> 39:49.794
For 200 and some years
have been underground.

39:49.946 --> 39:51.554
But that's an aside.

39:51.781 --> 39:54.449
We believe that the
garden shaft will supply us

39:54.467 --> 39:58.544
With some greater
understanding of the money pit,

39:58.638 --> 40:01.956
What has been done not only
in the previous 227 years

40:01.975 --> 40:03.900
But perhaps what
was done originally,

40:04.127 --> 40:06.794
What we call
the depositional phase.

40:06.888 --> 40:09.464
<i> Marty:</i>
<i> The idea of rehabilitating</i>
<i> a shaft so we can get</i>

40:09.482 --> 40:11.633
<i> Underground is exciting</i>

40:11.726 --> 40:13.076
Because actually being there,

40:13.303 --> 40:14.911
Actually getting down
and seeing things

40:15.062 --> 40:17.414
Is always the best,
the best data.

40:17.565 --> 40:20.825
<i> And I think we can trace</i>
<i> the gold in the water.</i>

40:20.977 --> 40:23.645

40:23.663 --> 40:25.997
<i>And figure out what</i>
<i>exactly happened on this island.</i>

40:26.091 --> 40:28.258
I think that we need to
get down under the ground.

40:28.485 --> 40:30.334
