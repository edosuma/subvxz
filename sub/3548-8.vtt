WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.175
MIKE WAS THE VICTIM...

00:04.175 --> 00:06.477
(engine revving)

00:06.477 --> 00:09.009
OF A HIT AND RUN.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.182
LYNETTE COULDN'T FORGIVE
HER MOTHER'S PAST.

00:11.182 --> 00:14.085
YOU HAD TOM TO COME HOME TO.
I HAD YOUR STEPFATHER.

00:14.085 --> 00:16.087
HEY, GLEN MAY HAVE BORED YOU,

00:16.087 --> 00:18.589
BUT THE YEARS WE HAD A FATHER
IN THAT HOUSE

00:18.589 --> 00:23.154
WERE THE HAPPIEST OF MY LIFE.
YOU DROVE HIM AWAY.
 MOM, WHERE'S GRANDMA GOING?

00:23.154 --> 00:27.458
BREE GOT HER SECOND CHANCE
TO BE A GOOD MOTHER.
 (cries)

00:27.458 --> 00:29.700
MIKE'S DEPENDENCY GREW...

00:29.700 --> 00:32.803
ADDICTS ARE EXPERTS
AT DECEPTION.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.665
(Gabrielle) VICTOR!
 GET UP. I WANNA SEE
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE

00:34.665 --> 00:36.567
WHEN THE KNIFE GOES IN.
 UHH!

00:36.567 --> 00:39.540
AND VICTOR WAS LOST AT SEA.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.147
(Mary Alice)
WE THINK OF THE PAST

00:46.147 --> 00:48.119
AS WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE,

00:48.119 --> 00:52.423
A CURRENT THAT CARRIES AWAY
THE MISTAKES OF OUR YOUTH--

00:52.423 --> 00:56.127
THE LOVES WE LOST...

00:56.127 --> 01:00.291
THE ADDICTIONS WE GAVE INTO...

01:00.291 --> 01:05.736
THE OPPORTUNITIES
WE THREW AWAY...

01:05.736 --> 01:07.568
BUT SOONER OR LATER,

01:07.568 --> 01:10.701
REMINDERS DRIFT BACK
INTO OUR LIVES...

01:10.701 --> 01:13.674
OF THE MISTAKES WE MADE...

01:13.674 --> 01:18.679
AND THE SINS WE COMMITTED.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.182
(hushed voice) CARLOS,
WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME?

01:21.182 --> 01:25.116
I TOLD YOU
WE CAN'T BE SEEN TOGETHER.
 (hushed voice)
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

01:25.116 --> 01:28.119
WE GOTTA GO TO THE COPS.
 OH, OKAY. AND SAY WHAT?
"YES, OFFICER,

01:28.119 --> 01:30.121
"MY LOVER AND I KNOCKED
MY HUSBAND OVERBOARD TWICE

01:30.121 --> 01:32.823
AND LEFT HIM FOR DEAD. OKAY.
BYE-BYE." I DON'T THINK SO.

01:32.823 --> 01:34.325
BUT HE'S THE MAYOR.

01:34.325 --> 01:36.767
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GONNA
NOTICE HE'S MISSING,

01:36.767 --> 01:38.769
AND THEN
THEY'RE GONNA ASK QUESTIONS.

01:38.769 --> 01:42.773
LET THEM ASK. NO ONE KNOWS
WE WERE ON THAT BOAT.

01:42.773 --> 01:46.337
LET'S JUST PLAY DUMB
AND RIDE THIS THING OUT.
 GABY, DON'T YOU FEEL GUILTY?
A MAN IS DEAD.

01:46.337 --> 01:48.379
YES, I FEEL AWFUL,
BUT HE THREATENED OUR LIVES.

01:48.379 --> 01:49.880
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

01:49.880 --> 01:53.644
EXACTLY. SO THEN WHY DON'T WE
GO AND TELL THE POLICE?

01:53.644 --> 01:55.246
O-OW!

01:58.219 --> 02:00.891
HE TOOK THE LORD'S NAME
IN VAIN. (scoffs)

02:03.123 --> 02:05.626
(lowers voice)
LOOK, WE HAVE A GOOD PLAN.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.728
LET'S JUST STICK TO IT.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.161
OKAY, OKAY.
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

02:10.161 --> 02:13.264
GOOD. NOW UNTIL THIS BLOWS OVER,
DON'T CALL ME AGAIN.

02:16.407 --> 02:18.909
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

02:18.909 --> 02:21.272
I'M PRAYING FOR A MIRACLE.

02:21.272 --> 02:24.175
CARLOS, IF VICTOR HAD LIVED,
HE WOULD'VE KILLED US.

02:24.175 --> 02:26.477
I'M THINKING WE ALREADY
HAD OUR MIRACLE.

02:34.225 --> 02:36.857
YES, THE MISTAKES OF OUR PAST

02:36.857 --> 02:42.633
HAVE A WAY OF DRIFTING BACK
INTO OUR LIVES...

02:42.633 --> 02:45.666
AND WHEN THEY DO...

02:45.666 --> 02:48.299
WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM.

03:03.954 --> 03:06.287
ONE DAY IN THE EARLY FALL,

03:06.287 --> 03:09.320
MIKE DELFINO HURT HIS SHOULDER.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.892
OW! GOD.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.394
TO EASE HIS PAIN,

03:13.394 --> 03:17.728
HE TOOK A LITTLE WHITE PILL
RECOMMENDED BY HIS DOCTOR.

03:17.728 --> 03:21.572
THE PAIN PERSISTED,
SO HE TOOK ANOTHER...

03:21.572 --> 03:24.605
AND ANOTHER.

03:24.605 --> 03:28.739
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN MIKE'S PAIN
BEGAN TO SUBSIDE,

03:28.739 --> 03:31.942
HIS NEED
FOR THE LITTLE WHITE PILLS...

03:31.942 --> 03:33.714
DID NOT.

03:33.714 --> 03:39.250
BUT MIKE NEVER SHARED THIS
WITH THOSE WHO CARED ABOUT HIM,

03:39.250 --> 03:43.594
ONLY WITH THOSE WHO COULD NOT
HAVE CARED LESS.

03:43.594 --> 03:46.397
(beeping)

03:46.397 --> 03:49.400
HEY, IT'S MIKE. I'M OUT.
I NEED TO MEET YOU TOMORROW.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.462
GREAT.
GOT THAT MONEY YOU OWE ME?

03:51.462 --> 03:54.265
NO, BUT YOU KNOW
I'M GOOD FOR IT.

03:54.265 --> 03:56.307
YOU PRICE
CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOKS LATELY?

03:56.307 --> 03:57.768
THEY'RE, LIKE, 300 BUCKS.

03:57.768 --> 03:59.810
I NEED MY MONEY, MIKE.

03:59.810 --> 04:01.812
AND YOU'LL GET IT, ALL RIGHT?

04:01.812 --> 04:04.345
CAN'T YOU JUST FRONT ME
SOMETHING FOR NOW?

04:04.345 --> 04:06.347
WELL, ADVICE IS FREE.
PILLS AREN'T.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.550
MY ADVICE--GET SOME CASH.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.721
(beep)

04:10.721 --> 04:12.783
(water running)

04:12.783 --> 04:15.826
(vehicle approaches)

04:20.831 --> 04:23.564
OH.

04:26.036 --> 04:29.370
SO, HEY, YOU KNOW,
I BETTER GET GOING.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.573
(Julie)
YEAH, UM, I SHOULD, TOO.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.046
HEY!

04:36.046 --> 04:37.448
MOM.

04:37.448 --> 04:40.581
CAN WE TALK?
THIS WILL JUST TAKE A SECOND.

04:42.813 --> 04:44.885
DID YOU KISS THAT BOY?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.888
NO, I WAS
KIND OF INTERRUPTED.
 OH, WELL,
YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.890
DO YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS
HIS TONGUE PIERCED?

04:49.890 --> 04:53.594
YEAH. HE SHOWED ME.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
 I CHECKED OUT HIS WEB PAGE.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.597
YOU DID NOT.
 I DID, TOO, AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE HE HAS PIERCED?

04:56.597 --> 04:59.400
AND IF YOU DO,
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
 OKAY, YES, MOM,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.472
DEREK HAS BOUGHT
INTO THE WHOLE PIERCING CRAZE,

05:01.472 --> 05:04.475
BUT AREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME TO NOT JUDGE A BOOK

05:04.475 --> 05:07.478
BY ITS COVER?
 IF THE COVER HAS HOLES IN IT,
THE BOOK IS NO GOOD.

05:07.478 --> 05:09.980
OKAY,
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.983
I AM GOING TO KISS DEREK
GOOD NIGHT.
 OH, FINE. BREAK MY HEART.

05:12.983 --> 05:15.986
WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?
WE'RE JUST DATING.

05:15.986 --> 05:18.749
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO PUT A RING ON MY FINGER.

05:18.749 --> 05:21.752
TRUST ME. YOUR FINGER
IS NOT WHERE HE'D PUT IT.
 (scoffs)

05:21.752 --> 05:22.923
(door slams)

05:22.923 --> 05:23.924
(sighs)

05:31.802 --> 05:34.805
AW, HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL
WHEN HE SLEEPS.

05:34.805 --> 05:36.807
I'LL PUT HIM IN THE CRIB.

05:36.807 --> 05:38.839
NO,
HE'LL BE SLEEPING WITH US.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.671
WHY?
IS HE RUNNING A FEVER?

05:40.671 --> 05:43.374
HE'S FINE, BUT I'VE BEEN
DOING SOME READING,

05:43.374 --> 05:45.376
AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SAY

05:45.376 --> 05:47.518
THAT BABIES SLEEP BETTER
NEXT TO THEIR PARENTS.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.820
IT'S CALLED THE "FAMILY BED."
 NO, I'VE HEARD OF THAT.

05:49.820 --> 05:52.683
ISN'T IT DESIGNED
TO FACILITATE BREAST-FEEDING?

05:52.683 --> 05:54.985
PARTLY. WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

05:54.985 --> 05:57.988
YOU'RE NOT LACTATING. IF OUR SON
WANTS TO BE NEAR THE MILK,

05:57.988 --> 06:00.531
HE'LL HAVE TO SLEEP
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

06:00.531 --> 06:02.533
(scoffs) THIS ISN'T
JUST FOR ME AND BENJAMIN.

06:02.533 --> 06:05.396
THIS WILL HELP YOU
BOND WITH HIM, TOO.

06:05.396 --> 06:08.939
OH, PERHAPS, BUT IT'S SURE NOT
GONNA HELP ME BOND WITH YOU.

06:08.939 --> 06:10.941
DARLING, SEX IS
THE LAST THING WOMEN WANT

06:10.941 --> 06:12.943
RIGHT AFTER
THEY'VE GIVEN BIRTH.

06:12.943 --> 06:16.477
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE BIRTH. YOU
WATCHED AND SERVED REFRESHMENTS.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.750
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE CARING
FOR AN INFANT ANY LESS TIRING.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.753
CAN'T WE
JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE?

06:24.555 --> 06:26.557
I SUPPOSE.

06:33.424 --> 06:35.726
WHAT IF I ROLL OVER
AND CRUSH HIM?

06:35.726 --> 06:37.468
DON'T.

06:37.468 --> 06:40.771
(sighs)

06:44.505 --> 06:46.607
YES, HI.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY MOM.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.609
SHE HANGS OUT
AT YOUR BAR SOMETIMES.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.040
STELLA WINGFIELD?

06:50.040 --> 06:54.114
UH, OLDER LADY, BIG SMOKER,
TALKS LIKE A TEAMSTER.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.117
WELL, THAT'S YOUR FAULT
FOR LETTING HER RUN A TAB.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.451
LOOK,IFYOU SEE HER, COULD YOU
TELL HER TO CALL LYNETTE?

07:00.451 --> 07:01.822
THANK YOU.

07:01.822 --> 07:02.993
(beep)

07:02.993 --> 07:04.995
I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE WORRIED,

07:04.995 --> 07:07.758
BUT I AM SURE
YOUR MOTHER IS FINE.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.760
SHE'S BROKE AND OLD AND RUDE.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.132
THAT IS NOT A WINNING
COMBINATION ON THE STREET.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.834
STELLA
IS VERY RESOURCEFUL.
 (beeping)

07:13.834 --> 07:16.837
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT
SHE ONCE MADE HER OWN BOOZE

07:16.837 --> 07:19.209
BY PUTTING A BAG OF ORANGES
UNDER THE RADIATOR?

07:19.209 --> 07:22.212
LUCY, LYDIA AND I FOUGHT
OVER WHOHADTO TAKE HER.

07:22.212 --> 07:25.946
SHE WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE. GOD ONLY
KNOWS WHAT SHE HEARD US SAY.
 YEAH, WELL, AFTER THE CRAP
SHE PUT YOU GUYS THROUGH,

07:25.946 --> 07:29.580
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO RESENT HER.
 IT IS A LOT EASIER
TO RESENT YOUR PARENTS

07:29.580 --> 07:31.852
WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE SAFE
IN SOME RETIREMENT VILLAGE,

07:31.852 --> 07:33.854
BUT TO KNOW
THAT SHE'S OUT THERE,

07:33.854 --> 07:36.186
MAYBE LYING FACEDOWN
IN AN ALLEY...

07:36.186 --> 07:38.188
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WANTS YOU TO DO.

07:38.188 --> 07:42.062
SHE WANTS YOU TO FEEL GUILTY.
DON'T BUY INTO IT.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.064
OKAY. OKAY.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.898
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:47.898 --> 07:50.571
(sighs)

07:50.571 --> 07:51.942
LYNETTE.

07:51.942 --> 07:56.577
THE MORGUE IS LISTED
UNDER GOVERNMENT OFFICES, RIGHT?

07:58.609 --> 08:00.911
(knock on door, door opens)

08:00.911 --> 08:02.513
MRS. LANG?

08:02.513 --> 08:04.154
THE POLICE ARE HERE.

08:08.659 --> 08:11.622
(sighs)

08:13.493 --> 08:15.025
OH.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.099
(ring clatters on table)

08:25.876 --> 08:28.038
MA'AM.

08:28.038 --> 08:30.541
I'M DETECTIVE BERRY.
THIS IS DETECTIVE LYONS.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.543
CAN WE ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

08:32.543 --> 08:33.714
OF COURSE.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.716
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW MR. LANG?

08:35.716 --> 08:38.749
I GUESS TWO DAYS AGO.
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

08:38.749 --> 08:42.522
HIS OFFICE
HAS REPORTED HIM MISSING.
 OH, NO. THEY DID?

08:42.522 --> 08:45.626
AND THIS MORNING,
THE COAST GUARD

08:45.626 --> 08:47.628
FOUND HIS EMPTY BOAT
FLOATING IN THE BAY.

08:47.628 --> 08:51.602
OH, MY GOD.
I HOPE THIS ISN'T...

08:51.602 --> 08:52.903
OH.

08:52.903 --> 08:56.567
LAST TIME I SAW HIM,
I TOLD HIM I WAS LEAVING HIM.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.640
HOW DID HE REACT
TO THAT NEWS?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.542
WELL, HE TOOK IT
PRETTY HARD.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.545
OH, YOU DON'T THINK HE DID
ANYTHING STUPID, DO YOU?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.218
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE DON'T.

09:08.218 --> 09:09.720
YOU DON'T?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.722
WHEN WE EXAMINED THE BOAT,

09:11.722 --> 09:13.984
WE DIDN'T FIND
A SINGLE FINGERPRINT,

09:13.984 --> 09:15.656
NOT EVEN MR. LANG'S.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.958
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.130
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT MEANS?

09:20.130 --> 09:22.663
IT WOULD INDICATE SOMEBODY
WIPED THAT BOAT DOWN

09:22.663 --> 09:24.665
AFTER MR. LANG WAS...
GONE.

09:24.665 --> 09:29.640
WHOEVER WAS ON THAT BOAT
IS CLEARLY NOT THAT BRIGHT.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.643
OKAY, THIS IS NO TIME FOR
NAME-CALLING. A MAN IS MISSING.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.675
WELL, DON'T WORRY, MA'AM.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.678
WE GOT OUR BEST MEN
ON THIS CASE, 'ROUND THE CLOCK.

09:37.678 --> 09:41.351
WE'LL FIND OUT EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HUSBAND.

09:41.351 --> 09:43.654
GREAT.

09:57.628 --> 09:58.669
OH. (sighs)

09:58.669 --> 10:01.171
(knock on door)

10:01.171 --> 10:03.273
(sighs)

10:05.976 --> 10:07.878
HI.

10:07.878 --> 10:10.741
HI. I'M BARRETT.
IS MIKE HOME?
 NO, HE'S AT WORK.

10:10.741 --> 10:13.143
OH, SHOOT.
I NEEDED TO TALK TO HIM.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.385
WE'RE, UH, JUST DOING
SOME BUSINESS TOGETHER.

10:15.385 --> 10:18.318
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHEN HE'S GONNA BE HOME,

10:18.318 --> 10:22.152
BUT YOU COULD COME BACK
LATER TONIGHT.
 OH, I CAN'T DO THAT. I HAVE
TO STUDY FOR AN ORGO TEST.

10:22.152 --> 10:24.855
ORGO?
 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.
I'M PRE-MED.

10:24.855 --> 10:27.798
PRE-MED?

10:27.798 --> 10:28.829
REALLY?

10:36.707 --> 10:38.638
(sighs deeply)

10:38.638 --> 10:40.741
OH, HELLO, DEAR.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.073
ANDREW, GET ORSON'S PLATE
FROM THE OVEN.

10:43.073 --> 10:46.016
ASK ME
HOW MY MORNING WAS.

10:46.016 --> 10:48.118
ALL RIGHT. HOW WAS IT?

10:48.118 --> 10:49.820
AFTER TWO NIGHTS

10:49.820 --> 10:51.822
OF SLEEPLESS BONDING
WITH MY SON,

10:51.822 --> 10:53.123
I NEARLY DOZED OFF

10:53.123 --> 10:55.185
WHILE REPAIRING
MRS. COLBY'S CRACKED MOLAR.

10:55.185 --> 10:58.959
I DOUBT IF THE CROWN I PUT IN
WILL LAST HER A YEAR.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.091
SO YOU'LL REPLACE IT
FOR FREE.

11:01.091 --> 11:02.933
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.935
HOW IS A DENTIST
SUPPOSED TO FEEL

11:04.935 --> 11:07.768
WHEN HE CAN'T GIVE A 90-YEAR-OLD
A LIFETIME GUARANTEE?

11:07.768 --> 11:12.202
BREE, I'M SORRY, BUT THIS WHOLE
FAMILY BED THING HAS TO STOP.

11:12.202 --> 11:14.705
OH, GIVE IT SOME TIME.
WE'RE STILL ADJUSTING,

11:14.705 --> 11:17.708
AND BENJAMIN
IS SLEEPING SO SOUNDLY.

11:17.708 --> 11:20.010
WELL, HE CAN SLEEP
JUST AS SOUNDLY IN A CRIB.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.452
FROM WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME,

11:22.452 --> 11:25.816
YOU AND REX DIDN'T HAUL ANDREW
INTO BED WITH YOU.
 NO, AND I WISH WE HAD.

11:25.816 --> 11:28.819
IF WE DID, HE MIGHTN'T
HAVE TURNED OUT SO...

11:28.819 --> 11:30.821
SO WHAT?

11:30.821 --> 11:32.963
STUPID? LAZY? SHORT?

11:32.963 --> 11:35.025
I WAS GOING TO SAY ANGRY,

11:35.025 --> 11:37.397
AND PERHAPS
THAT ANGER BEGAN

11:37.397 --> 11:40.330
WHEN WE EXILED YOU
TO THE NURSERY.

11:40.330 --> 11:43.333
I'M JUST TRYING TO LEARN
FROM MY MISTAKES.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.737
SO I'M--I'M WHAT,
LIKE THE FIRST PANCAKE?

11:46.737 --> 11:48.909
DON'T BE SO SENSITIVE.

11:48.909 --> 11:52.482
WE'LL FIND SOMETHING TO HELP
YOU SLEEP--MAYBE SOME WARM MILK.

11:52.482 --> 11:54.484
I KNOW SOMETHING
THAT USED TO HELP ME SLEEP.

11:54.484 --> 11:58.749
OF COURSE, THAT'S OFF THE MENU
THESE DAYS.
 COULD THE MISTAKE
HAVE THE SALT?

11:58.749 --> 12:01.221
AND IF YOU'RE AS TIRED
AS YOU SAY YOU ARE,

12:01.221 --> 12:03.223
THEN YOU'RE BOUND
TO SLEEP BETTER TONIGHT.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.456
YES, I WILL, BECAUSE I'LL BE
SLEEPING IN THE DEN.
 YOU'RE LEAVING OUR BED?

12:06.456 --> 12:09.900
DARLING, I NEED TO EITHER SLEEP
OR GET LUCKY TONIGHT.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.903
I'LL HAVE A BETTER SHOT
AT BOTH IF I'M ALONE.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.972
GOSH, YOU'RE STUDYING
TO BE A DOCTOR.

12:21.972 --> 12:25.115
THAT MUST NOT LEAVE YOU
A LOT OF FREE TIME FOR HOBBIES

12:25.115 --> 12:27.147
OR... A GIRLFRIEND.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.450
WELL, I HAVE THE TIME. I JUST
DON'T HAVE THE GIRLFRIEND.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.052
OH. WELL, NO RUSH.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.455
YOU KNOW, JUST YESTERDAY, I WAS
TELLING MY DAUGHTER JULIE--

12:35.455 --> 12:37.457
OH, YOU KNOW,
THAT IS SO RUDE.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.459
I-I'M TALKING
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER,

12:39.459 --> 12:43.333
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.995
THAT'S HER.

12:44.995 --> 12:46.466
SHE'S CUTE.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.969
OH, BARRETT, I WASN'T
FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.470
IF IWAS...

12:50.470 --> 12:52.803
I WOULD'VE
SHOWN YOU THIS ONE.

12:52.803 --> 12:54.344
WOW.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.506
(cell phone rings)

12:56.506 --> 12:59.049
OH, EXCUSE ME. I'M SORRY.
I GOTTA TAKE THIS.

12:59.049 --> 13:03.053
OH, SURE. I HAVE
TO CHECK ON THE LAUNDRY.

13:03.053 --> 13:04.815
(beep)

13:04.815 --> 13:06.356
YEAH?

13:06.356 --> 13:08.859
(lowers voice) NO, BONEHEAD,
I DON'T SELL THAT STUFF.

13:08.859 --> 13:11.862
JUST PILLS, SMOKES
AND 'SHROOMAGE. THAT'S IT.

13:16.526 --> 13:19.970
20 BUCKS, CASH ONLY.
MEET YOU AT THE DORM.
 (beep)

13:19.970 --> 13:23.904
LOOK WHAT I FOUND
ON THE DRYER.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.977
JULIE WON SECOND PLACE
IN THE STATE SCIENCE FAIR.

13:26.977 --> 13:28.939
THAT'S AWESOME.

13:28.939 --> 13:30.981
YEAH,
GOOD-LOOKINGANDSMART.

13:30.981 --> 13:32.282
ONLY PROBLEM IS,

13:32.282 --> 13:34.945
WHERE IS SHE GONNA FIND
SOMEONE ELSE LIKE THAT?

13:34.945 --> 13:37.317
WELL, I GOTTA GET GOING.
MY STUDY PARTNER'S

13:37.317 --> 13:39.850
GIVING ME A HARD TIME
ABOUT THAT TEST, SO...

13:39.850 --> 13:42.853
OH, THAT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK TOMORROW

13:42.853 --> 13:45.856
TO SEE MIKE, AND IF JULIE
HAPPENS TO BE HERE,

13:45.856 --> 13:47.858
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE HER
SOME ADVICE

13:47.858 --> 13:49.930
ON PICKING OUT COLLEGES
AND STUFF.

13:49.930 --> 13:54.234
YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.
SEE YOU TOMORROW, MRS. DELFINO.
 OH, PLEASE, CALL ME "MOM."

13:54.234 --> 13:56.206
UH, BECAUSE...

13:56.206 --> 13:59.169
THAT'S WHAT ALL THE KIDS
CALL ME.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.474
(door shuts)

14:04.474 --> 14:06.076
(sighs)

14:06.076 --> 14:08.919
OH, THANK YOU.

14:10.180 --> 14:13.483
HEY, BREE. (chuckles)
TABLE FOR, UH, ONE AND A HALF?

14:13.483 --> 14:16.526
NO, THANKS. I'M JUST DROPPING
OFF ANDREW'S CELL PHONE.

14:16.526 --> 14:19.189
HE FORGOT IT AGAIN.
 OKAY. I'LL GIVE IT TO HIM.

14:19.189 --> 14:22.192
UM, TOM,
MAY I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
 MM-HMM.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.194
DID YOU AND LYNETTE
DO THE FAMILY BED

14:24.194 --> 14:27.197
WHEN YOUR CHILDREN
WERE BABIES?
 WELL, IT WASN'T
EXACTLY A CHOICE.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.869
THEY JUST KEPT CRAWLING
IN THERE. (chuckles)

14:29.869 --> 14:33.103
SO, UM, NOT TO PRY,
BUT, UM,

14:33.103 --> 14:37.047
DID THAT CREATE ANY,
UH, ISSUES FOR YOU?

14:37.047 --> 14:40.951
YOU MEAN SEX?
 (chuckles nervously) APPARENTLY,
"NOT TO PRY" WASN'T NECESSARY.

14:40.951 --> 14:43.954
WELL, IT DID PUT A CRIMP
ON THINGS AT FIRST,

14:43.954 --> 14:46.286
BUT THAT JUST FORCED US
TO BE MORE CREATIVE.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.990
OH. AGAIN, NOT TO PRY,
BUT--

14:49.990 --> 14:51.291
THE OFFICE.
 (gasps)

14:51.291 --> 14:53.563
WE DID IT AT THE OFFICE,
ONCE IN THE CAR,

14:53.563 --> 14:56.566
AND YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU
ASKED US TO WATCH THE HOUSE

14:56.566 --> 14:58.568
WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE GOING OUT OF TOWN?

14:58.568 --> 15:02.332
OKAY. THANKS.
YES, UM, WE'LL BE GOING NOW.

15:02.332 --> 15:06.036
HEY, OTHER THAN YOUR ISSUE,
HOW DOES ORSON LIKE BEING A DAD?

15:06.036 --> 15:08.038
OH, HE JUST ADORES IT.

15:08.038 --> 15:11.111
THE THREE OF US ARE
SUCH A HAPPY LITTLE FAMILY.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.283
AREN'T WE? MM.
 THAT IS GREAT.

15:13.283 --> 15:15.915
BYE.
 BYE.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.417
(front door opens)

15:19.319 --> 15:21.321
(door shuts)

15:29.929 --> 15:33.033
WELL, I REPLACED THAT GASKET.
(groans) SHOULDN'T LEAK ANYMORE.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.105
GREAT.
 (doorbell rings)

15:35.105 --> 15:37.137
WHY DON'T YOU GRAB US
A COUPLE BEERS?

15:42.172 --> 15:45.415
SYLVIA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:45.415 --> 15:46.716
BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

15:46.716 --> 15:48.718
LOOK, YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

15:48.718 --> 15:51.081
I DON'T WANT KATHERINE
FINDING YOU HERE.

15:51.081 --> 15:52.382
OH, BUT KATHERINE'S GONE.

15:52.382 --> 15:56.156
I WAITED UNTIL SHE DROVE AWAY
SO WE COULD BE ALONE.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.228
AREN'T YOU GONNA
INVITE ME IN?

15:58.228 --> 16:01.291
AFTER YOU RUINED MY LIFE?
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.094
YOU RUINED YOUR OWN LIFE.

16:04.094 --> 16:06.436
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT US.

16:06.436 --> 16:09.139
SYLVIA, WHY DON'T YOU
DO US BOTH A FAVOR

16:09.139 --> 16:11.141
AND GO BACK TO CHICAGO?

16:11.141 --> 16:13.173
ADAM, LET ME IN.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.575
HEY, MAN. YOUR, UH,
YOUR BEER'S GETTING WARM.

16:17.047 --> 16:20.350
OH, YOU HAVE GUESTS.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.152
WELL,

16:22.152 --> 16:26.186
I GUESS I'LL JUST DROP BY
SOME OTHER TIME.

16:32.322 --> 16:34.164
(locks door)

16:34.164 --> 16:37.127
I'M SORRY, MAN. IT JUST SOUNDED
LIKE YOU NEEDED A LITTLE HELP.

16:37.127 --> 16:40.130
THANKS. THAT'S, UM,
A-AN EX-PATIENT...
 OH.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.533
WITH SOME PRETTY SERIOUS
MENTAL PROBLEMS.

16:43.533 --> 16:47.107
UH, COULD YOU DO ME
A BIG FAVOR?

16:47.107 --> 16:49.679
I'D RATHER KATHERINE
DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS HERE.

16:49.679 --> 16:51.741
OH. OH, YEAH.

16:51.741 --> 16:54.214
YEAH, THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.517
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I WAS
GONNA ASK YOU A FAVOR, TOO.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.620
I'VE GOT THIS PAIN
IN MY SHOULDER.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.223
YOU--YOU THINK YOU COULD
WRITE ME A PRESCRIPTION?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.224
OH, I WISH
I COULD HELP YOU OUT,

17:05.224 --> 17:07.727
BUT A GYNECOLOGIST WRITING
A PRESCRIPTION FOR A MAN?

17:07.727 --> 17:10.029
IT KIND OF RAISES
A RED FLAG.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.432
YEAH.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.464
AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.066
THIS FAVOR THING

17:16.066 --> 17:19.368
DOESN'T HAVE
TO GO BOTH WAYS.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.474
LINDA, IS MRS. ZIMMERMAN HERE?

17:32.152 --> 17:33.483
HELLO, DOCTOR.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.755
BREE.
WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.757
UH, I'VE GOT
A NEW PATIENT COMING IN.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.290
MMM, YES, YOU DO.

17:40.290 --> 17:44.134
I'M MRS. ZIMMERMAN.

17:44.134 --> 17:49.439
UH, YOUR MESSAGE SAID YOU HAD
A CAVITY THAT NEEDED FILLING?

17:49.439 --> 17:54.404
I WAS IN A VERY NAUGHTY MOOD
WHEN I LEFT THAT.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.779
(whirring)

18:02.252 --> 18:05.355
YOU'RE WAITING OUTSIDE.
WHY ARE YOU WAITING OUTSIDE?

18:05.355 --> 18:09.088
EVERYTHING IS FINE.
IT'S JUST, UM, SOMEONE'S HERE.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.090
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S THE POLICE?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.493
NO, NO.
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.595
IT'S YOUR STEPFATHER.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.211
GLEN?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.413
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.646
LYNNIE.

18:36.646 --> 18:39.219
OH, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.452
OH, GOD. ONLY THREE DECADES
GIVE OR TAKE A YEAR,

18:42.452 --> 18:45.255
BUT WHO CARES?
 (chuckles)

18:45.255 --> 18:48.158
OH, GOSH.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

18:48.158 --> 18:51.201
OH, SO DO YOU, ALTHOUGH
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT'S THIS?

18:51.201 --> 18:53.863
OH, JUST A LITTLE CANCER.

18:53.863 --> 18:55.905
NO, BUT I KICKED ITS ASS.
I'M GOOD NOW.

18:55.905 --> 18:57.537
OH.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.538
OH.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.569
(laughs)

18:59.569 --> 19:01.441
HI. HI. HI. HI!

19:01.441 --> 19:04.414
YOU COME HERE. OH!

19:04.414 --> 19:06.816
SO WHY--WHY ARE YOU HERE?

19:06.816 --> 19:08.218
WELL...

19:08.218 --> 19:11.181
YOUR MOTHER CALLED ME.

19:11.181 --> 19:13.553
SHE DID? IS SHE OKAY?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.386
UH, SHE SOUNDS FINE.
SHE ASKED FOR MONEY.

19:16.386 --> 19:19.158
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS
HAD KEPT IN TOUCH.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.160
WELL, WE HADN'T.
I'M MEETING HER TOMORROW

19:21.160 --> 19:24.494
AT FAIRVIEW PARK
TO GIVE IT TO HER,

19:24.494 --> 19:27.367
AND I'M GUESSING
YOU'LL WANT TO COME WITH ME.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.240
YES, YES, THANK YOU,
BUT WHERE HAS SHE BEEN STAYING?

19:30.240 --> 19:32.742
SHE BROKE INTO A CAR
AND SPENT THE NIGHT THERE.

19:32.742 --> 19:34.374
OH, MY GOD.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.806
BUT SHE DID SAY
IT WAS A CADILLAC.

19:36.806 --> 19:40.580
OH, WELL, GOOD. AT LEAST
SHE'S NOT LIVING LIKE A HOBO.

19:41.851 --> 19:44.414
OH, MY GOD. I'M SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.516
OH, YOU, TOO, LYNNIE.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.288
MM.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.222
HEY, BREE.

19:52.222 --> 19:55.225
OH. (chuckles)
HELLO, ADAM.

19:55.225 --> 19:58.228
I JUST DROPPED BY TO SEE
YOUR HUSBAND. IS HE HERE?

19:58.228 --> 20:01.801
HE'S IN THE EXAM ROOM,
READJUSTING THE CHAIR.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.706
LOOK, I'M SORRY
MIKE IS IN SUCH PAIN,

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY ETHICAL

20:08.708 --> 20:10.840
FOR ME TO WRITE HIM
A PRESCRIPTION.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.842
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE DICEY,

20:12.842 --> 20:14.844
BUT YOU'D REALLY
BE DOING ME A BIG FAVOR.

20:14.844 --> 20:16.846
BY THE WAY, BREE LOOKS GREAT.

20:16.846 --> 20:19.218
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE
I DELIVERED DANIELLE'S BABY.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.452
SORRY. YOUR BABY.

20:27.997 --> 20:30.229
HEY, ANDREW.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.531
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:31.531 --> 20:34.464
JUST GIVING YOU THAT SEWING ROOM
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

20:34.464 --> 20:37.267
YOU'RE MOVING OUT?

20:37.267 --> 20:40.640
BUT YOU CAN'T
AFFORD AN APARTMENT.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.241
I CAN AFFORD THIS ONE,

20:42.241 --> 20:45.244
WHICH WILL GIVE YOU SOME IDEA
HOW CRAPPY THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.248
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

20:49.248 --> 20:52.251
I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU. HOW ARE
YOU GONNA GET A FRESH START

20:52.251 --> 20:54.824
WITH YOUR PAST MISTAKES
STINKING UP THE PLACE?

20:54.824 --> 20:57.287
IS THIS
ABOUT THE OTHER MORNING?

20:57.287 --> 21:00.830
OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKES,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.663
I AM. IN FACT, I ALREADY
GAVE THE LANDLORD A CHECK.

21:03.663 --> 21:07.737
SO I HOPE THE THREE OF YOU
ARE VERY HAPPY.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.585
WELL, TO BE HONEST,

21:25.585 --> 21:27.717
I'M NOT ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE
GIVING THIS TO YOU, MIKE.

21:27.717 --> 21:30.320
PAIN MEDICATION
ONLY HELPS YOUR SYMPTOMS.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.793
IF THIS IS CHRONIC, YOU NEED TO
BE SEEING A PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.796
YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED, ORSON?
I NEED TO TAKE A FEW WEEKS OFF,

21:36.796 --> 21:39.298
BUT I CAN'T,
'CAUSE I'VE GOT TO WORK...

21:39.298 --> 21:41.300
FOR THE BABY,
FOR JULIE'S CLASS TRIP,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.832
THE PATIO FURNITURE

21:42.832 --> 21:45.475
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
SUSAN'S GOT ME PAYING FOR.

21:45.475 --> 21:48.338
ARE YOU OKAY, MIKE?
YOU SOUND A LITTLE UNHAPPY.

21:48.338 --> 21:50.540
(sighs) NO, NO, I'M HAPPY,

21:50.540 --> 21:53.543
AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT
ALL OF THIS ON SUSAN.

21:53.543 --> 21:58.648
IT'S JUST, WHEN I SIGNED UP
FOR THIS SUBURBAN DAD THING,

21:58.648 --> 22:01.851
I DIDN'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT
I WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO.

22:01.851 --> 22:03.353
NO, I UNDERSTAND.

22:03.353 --> 22:05.825
STILL, THIS IS NO WAY
TO DEAL WITH STRESS.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.527
IT'S NOT ABOUT STRESS.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.529
IT'S ABOUT THE PAIN
I'VE BEEN IN EVERY DAY

22:09.529 --> 22:11.761
SINCE I GOT HIT BY THAT CAR.

22:11.761 --> 22:15.465
YOU MEAN THIS PAIN
IS RELATED TO YOUR ACCIDENT?

22:15.465 --> 22:16.766
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

22:16.766 --> 22:19.739
SOME SON OF A BITCH
RAN ME DOWN AND TOOK OFF.

22:19.739 --> 22:23.373
RIGHT.

22:23.373 --> 22:25.715
WELL, I HOPE THIS HELPS.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.088
MM.

22:39.088 --> 22:42.361
OH, MIKE, YOU'RE HOME.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.034
I WAS DREAMING
WE WERE PONIES.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.867
THAT'S NICE.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

22:47.867 --> 22:53.142
HEY, THAT KID, UM, BARRETT
CAME BY TODAY.

22:53.142 --> 22:54.674
WHAT?

22:54.674 --> 22:58.147
YEAH, HE SAID THAT YOU
OWED HIM MONEY FOR SOME...

22:58.147 --> 23:02.111
PLUMBING JOB
THAT HE HELPED YOU ON.

23:02.111 --> 23:06.015
YEAH. YEAH,
I GOTTA GET THAT TO HIM.

23:06.015 --> 23:08.588
OH.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.791
HE'S COMING BACK TOMORROW.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.794
(water running)
 DON'T YOU THINK
HE WOULD BE PERFECT FOR JULIE?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.969
(beeping)

23:22.802 --> 23:25.905
BARRETT, IT'S DELFINO.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.709
I'M ONLY GONNA SAY THIS ONCE.
I'LL GET YOU YOUR MONEY,

23:29.709 --> 23:32.612
BUT DON'TEVER
 COME TO MY HOUSE AGAIN.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.913
YOU GOT IT?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.816
EVER.

23:44.994 --> 23:46.996
(beeping)

23:49.699 --> 23:51.000
YES, HELLO.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.503
I'D, UH, LIKE TO LEAVE
AN ANONYMOUS TIP

23:53.503 --> 23:55.434
ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

23:55.434 --> 24:01.010
UH, DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND
OF VOICE MAIL MENU FOR THAT?

24:01.010 --> 24:03.042
WELL, IT'S ABOUT THE MAYOR.

24:04.674 --> 24:07.016
OH, I DON'T THINK HE'S MISSING.

24:07.016 --> 24:09.549
I THINK HE'S DEAD.

24:09.549 --> 24:12.722
LOOK, THAT'S IT.
WE GOTTA GO TO THE COPS.

24:12.722 --> 24:14.023
CARLOS, PLEASE.

24:14.023 --> 24:16.025
LOOK, WE BLEW IT WITH
THE FINGERPRINTS, ALL RIGHT?

24:16.025 --> 24:18.788
NOW THEY KNOW SOMEONE ELSE
WAS WITH HIM ON THE BOAT.

24:18.788 --> 24:21.661
THEY DON'T KNOW
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS US.
 IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

24:21.661 --> 24:25.194
I MEAN, MAKE A LIST OF PEOPLE
WITH A MOTIVE TO KILL VICTOR.

24:25.194 --> 24:27.196
NUMBER ONE--YOU.
NUMBER TWO--YOU.

24:27.196 --> 24:29.499
NUMBER THREE--MAYBE ME,
PROBABLY STILL YOU.

24:29.499 --> 24:33.172
OKAY, IF WE JUST STAY CALM
AND STICK TO THE STORY...

24:33.172 --> 24:34.944
WE TRIED THAT.

24:34.944 --> 24:37.707
IT'S NOT WORKING.

24:37.707 --> 24:39.909
I'M GOING TO THE COPS.

24:39.909 --> 24:41.911
NOW YOU CAN EITHER
COME WITH ME

24:41.911 --> 24:44.153
OR WAIT FOR THEM
TO COME AND GET YOU.

24:48.818 --> 24:51.020
FINE. I'LL GO.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.962
THANK YOU.

24:52.962 --> 24:56.726
CAN WE AT LEAST HAVE A DRINK
BEFORE WE GO? CALM OUR NERVES?

24:56.726 --> 24:58.728
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T TALK
TO THE COPS

24:58.728 --> 25:01.000
THE WAY
YOU'VE BEEN BABBLING TO ME.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.132
(sighs) I GUESS ONE DRINK
WOULDN'T HURT.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.810
(raises voice)
YOU OKAY WITH TEQUILA?

25:10.810 --> 25:12.742
ONLY IF
IT'S THE GOOD STUFF!

25:17.787 --> 25:21.020
OH, I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THIS HAS A REAL KICK.

25:26.896 --> 25:28.898
OH, AND THIS IS THE WORST.
DURING A DISSECTION,

25:28.898 --> 25:31.901
MY ANATOMY LAB PARTNER SQUIRTED
STOMACH JUICE IN MY EYE.

25:31.901 --> 25:34.904
EW. THAT IS SO DISGUSTING.
 OH, IT WAS TERRIBLE.

25:34.904 --> 25:37.737
(laughs) SO GROSS. EW.

25:45.274 --> 25:47.647
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING ABOUT?

25:47.647 --> 25:48.948
MY MATCHMAKING SKILLS.

25:48.948 --> 25:52.281
JULIE AND BARRETT
ARE REALLY HITTING IT OFF.

25:52.281 --> 25:55.024
BARRETT?

25:55.024 --> 25:56.325
YEAH, YOUR FRIEND.

25:56.325 --> 25:59.288
I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT
HE WAS COMING BY AGAIN.

25:59.288 --> 26:01.691
(milk pours)

26:03.793 --> 26:06.796
I APPRECIATE ALL THE PRESSURE
YOU'RE PUTTING ON ME.
 YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:06.796 --> 26:08.838
UH, JULIE,
COULD YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?

26:08.838 --> 26:11.170
BARRETT AND I HAVE
A LITTLE BUSINESS TO DISCUSS.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.603
SURE.
I'LL JUST GRAB MY JACKET.

26:16.105 --> 26:20.249
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM MY HOUSE.

26:20.249 --> 26:22.251
BUT YOUR WIFE INVITED ME.

26:22.251 --> 26:25.184
AND, HEY, YOU MARRIED
INTO A CUTE FAMILY. KUDOS.

26:25.184 --> 26:28.017
HERE'S YOUR MONEY.
NOW GET OUT.

26:28.017 --> 26:31.821
WE WERE JUST LEAVING. I'M TAKING
JULIE ON A TOUR OF MY CAMPUS.

26:31.821 --> 26:34.123
THERE IS NO WAY
I'M LETTING HER GO ANYWHERE

26:34.123 --> 26:36.626
WITH A LOWLIFE DRUG DEALER.

26:36.626 --> 26:38.628
LOWLIFE? DUDE, I'M A PRE-MED
STUDENT WHO'S FOUND

26:38.628 --> 26:41.070
AN ENTERPRISING WAY TO EARN
HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE.

26:41.070 --> 26:44.674
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARE A JUNKIE,

26:44.674 --> 26:47.807
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
YOUR CUTE FAMILY KNOWING THAT,

26:47.807 --> 26:49.138
DO YA?

26:49.138 --> 26:52.041
I'LL HAVE HER HOME
BY 10:00.

26:58.017 --> 27:01.921
MMM. THIS IS DELICIOUS,
MRS. DELFINO.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.023
THANK YOU. HEY, YOU KNOW,
WOULD YOU LIKE ME

27:04.023 --> 27:06.926
TO PACK SOME UP
FOR YOU GUYS TO TAKE?

27:06.926 --> 27:09.028
THIS GUY'S A DRUG DEALER.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.200
WHAT?

27:11.200 --> 27:15.164
YOU REMEMBER THOSE PILLS
YOU FOUND? HE SOLD THEM TO ME.

27:15.164 --> 27:18.237
LOOK, MRS. DELFINO--

27:18.237 --> 27:21.210
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

27:21.210 --> 27:23.943
GET HIM OUT OF MY HOUSE!

27:23.943 --> 27:26.645
OKAY. I'LL GO.

27:32.982 --> 27:34.884
IT'S A SHAME, THOUGH.

27:36.355 --> 27:39.228
HE WAS SUCH A GOOD CUSTOMER.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.066
(door opens, slams)

27:49.068 --> 27:52.141
HEY.

27:52.141 --> 27:55.044
WHERE'D BARRETT GO?

27:57.046 --> 27:59.348
WHY AM I SO SLEEPY
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

27:59.348 --> 28:01.210
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

28:01.210 --> 28:04.213
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL,
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT THIS OFF.

28:04.213 --> 28:08.217
NO, NO, NO.
WE GOTTA GO NOW.

28:08.217 --> 28:09.859
CRAP!
 WHAT?

28:09.859 --> 28:11.190
(grunts)

28:11.190 --> 28:12.822
OW. OH!

28:12.822 --> 28:15.194
DETECTIVES!

28:15.194 --> 28:17.326
ANY, UH, NEWS
ON MY HUSBAND?

28:17.326 --> 28:20.329
NOT YET, BUT WE'VE GOT
SOME MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

28:20.329 --> 28:23.302
OH, OKAY. SO ASK AWAY.

28:23.302 --> 28:26.435
MRS. LANG, WERE YOU HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH YOUR EX-HUSBAND?

28:26.435 --> 28:28.037
CARLOS?

28:28.037 --> 28:30.379
THAT'S CRAZY.
WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

28:30.379 --> 28:32.111
YOUR NEIGHBOR CALLED US.

28:32.111 --> 28:35.114
OH. WELL, YOU TELL EDIE BRITT
JUST BECAUSE CARLOS DUMPED HER,

28:35.114 --> 28:38.117
DOESN'T MEAN SHE HAS TO GO
AROUND TRASHING MY REPUTATION,

28:38.117 --> 28:41.150
ESPECIALLY
WHENSHE'STHE SLUT.

28:41.150 --> 28:43.452
WELL,
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM LATELY?

28:45.494 --> 28:48.998
BOY, LET ME THINK. UH...

28:48.998 --> 28:51.160
MM...

28:51.160 --> 28:54.263
NO. NO, I HAVEN'T.

28:54.263 --> 28:56.836
(cell phone rings)

28:56.836 --> 28:58.067
(beep)

28:58.067 --> 29:00.209
THIS IS LYONS.

29:00.209 --> 29:02.241
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.743
GOOD NEWS, MRS. LANG.
THEY FOUND YOUR HUSBAND.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.016
HUH?

29:07.016 --> 29:10.019
A COUPLE OF FISHERMEN FOUND HIM
WASHED UP ON THE BEACH.

29:10.019 --> 29:13.082
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS
BUT IN STABLE CONDITION.

29:13.082 --> 29:15.384
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL?

29:15.384 --> 29:18.327
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T I?

29:18.327 --> 29:20.930
JUST LET ME GRAB MY PURSE.

29:27.196 --> 29:30.169
WELL, YOU CAN STOP
FEELING GUILTY.

29:30.169 --> 29:33.242
VICTOR'S ALIVE,
AND WE'RE SCREWED.

29:33.242 --> 29:37.877
(snores)

29:49.458 --> 29:51.861
OKAY, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

29:51.861 --> 29:54.864
ONCE SHE SHOWS UP, YOU'LL MEET
HER AND GIVE HER THE MONEY.

29:54.864 --> 29:58.027
THEN ASK HER
TO WALK YOU BACK TO THE CAR.

29:58.027 --> 30:01.530
I'LL JUMP OUT, GRAB HER,
AND WHILE YOU OPEN THE TRUNK...
 LYNETTE.

30:01.530 --> 30:05.304
FINE, THE BACKSEAT, BUT YOU'RE
JUST GONNA SPOIL HER.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.837
I SEE YOU STILL HAVE
THAT WICKED SENSE OF HUMOR.

30:07.837 --> 30:11.210
YEAH. IT'S THE ONE GOOD THING
YOU GET FROM A CRAPPY CHILDHOOD.

30:14.844 --> 30:16.846
YOU KNOW, I...

30:16.846 --> 30:19.849
I ALWAYS REGRETTED
THE WAY THINGS ENDED.

30:19.849 --> 30:23.953
WHY? MOM CHEATED ON YOU.
NO ONE BLAMES YOU FOR LEAVING.

30:23.953 --> 30:27.426
IT WAS, UH,
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.099
HEY, I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

30:30.099 --> 30:32.501
WELL--

30:34.403 --> 30:36.405
AH, THERE'S BOOZE-ILLA NOW.

30:36.405 --> 30:39.508
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GO GET HER.
 (door beeps)

30:42.511 --> 30:45.014
HE BOUGHT THOSE PILLS
A LONG TIME AGO

30:45.014 --> 30:47.947
AND NEVER GOT AROUND
TO PAYING THE GUY.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.019
(scoffs) WOW.

30:50.019 --> 30:52.521
JULIE, IT'S NOT LIKE
IT WAS HEROIN OR CRACK.

30:52.521 --> 30:54.924
IT WAS JUST PAIN PILLS
FOR HIS SHOULDER,

30:54.924 --> 30:59.088
BUT WE HAD A TALK, AND HE HAS
TOTALLY STOPPED TAKING THEM.

30:59.088 --> 31:00.890
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE?

31:00.890 --> 31:01.991
YEAH.

31:01.991 --> 31:03.492
WHY?

31:03.492 --> 31:05.995
WELL, I WAS AT THE DRUGSTORE
THIS MORNING,

31:05.995 --> 31:09.168
AND I SAW MIKE THERE,
PICKING UP A PRESCRIPTION.

31:09.168 --> 31:12.001
(sighs)

31:16.906 --> 31:18.547
HELLO, STELLA.

31:18.547 --> 31:21.210
GLEN. WHAT THE HELL?

31:21.210 --> 31:23.552
(taps bench)

31:23.552 --> 31:25.554
I KNOW WE'RE THE SAME AGE.

31:25.554 --> 31:28.887
HOW IS IT YOU LOOK SO MUCH
BETTER THAN ME?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.920
WELL, I DON'T DRINK
OR SLEEP IN CARS.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.023
OH, SO THAT'S YOUR SECRET.
WHO KNEW?

31:34.023 --> 31:37.396
STELL, HERE'S THE MONEY.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.597
THANKS, DOLL.

31:38.597 --> 31:44.073
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING.

31:44.073 --> 31:47.306
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU SET ME UP.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.238
LYNETTE!

31:49.238 --> 31:51.410
OH, CRAP!

31:57.086 --> 31:59.949
NOW WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

31:59.949 --> 32:02.491
I'M OFF TO DIE IN A DITCH.
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

32:02.491 --> 32:05.394
OKAY, ENOUGH WITH THE DRAMA.
I WANT YOU TO COME HOME WITH ME.

32:05.394 --> 32:08.527
OH, REALLY? THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID TO LYDIA AND LUCY.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.001
I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT, MOM.
WE WERE JUST VENTING.

32:12.001 --> 32:14.003
PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU
NEED TO DO THAT.

32:14.003 --> 32:16.035
I WAS NOT
A HORRIBLE MOTHER,

32:16.035 --> 32:18.937
AND EVEN IF I WAS,

32:18.937 --> 32:21.240
IT'S OLD NEWS,
SO DROP IT.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.142
DROP IT?

32:23.142 --> 32:26.045
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
SHE WANTS ME TO DROP IT.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.048
AND WHEN SHE CHEATED ON YOU,
AND WHEN SHE WRECKED OUR FAMILY,

32:29.048 --> 32:32.481
I BET SHE WANTED YOU
TO DROP THAT, TOO.
 OKAY, GUYS--

32:32.481 --> 32:35.524
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE,
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET OVER IT,

32:35.524 --> 32:39.088
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY
THAT'LL MAKE YOU STOP HATING ME.

32:39.088 --> 32:42.731
THERE IS ONE THING
YOU COULD SAY.
 YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

32:42.731 --> 32:45.094
STELLA, SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN.
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

32:45.094 --> 32:46.535
HANDLE WHAT?

32:46.535 --> 32:48.597
GLEN, DON'T.

32:48.597 --> 32:50.599
LYNNIE...

32:50.599 --> 32:55.144
I DIDN'T LEAVE YOUR MOTHER
BECAUSE SHE CHEATED ON ME.

32:55.144 --> 32:58.107
I LEFT BECAUSE I'M GAY.

33:06.155 --> 33:08.657
(siren wailing in distance)
 MOM. YOU OKAY?

33:08.657 --> 33:11.660
JUST A BIT DIZZY FROM HOLDING
MY BREATH IN YOUR STAIRWELL.

33:11.660 --> 33:13.192
MAY I COME IN?

33:13.192 --> 33:15.694
OH, I'D--I'D KIND OF
RATHER YOU NOT SEE THE PLACE

33:15.694 --> 33:17.696
UNTIL I GET IT FIXED UP.

33:17.696 --> 33:20.629
WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE
TO TAKE MY VEAL SCALOPPINI

33:20.629 --> 33:22.131
AND GO HOME.

33:24.173 --> 33:27.176
MMM.

33:27.176 --> 33:31.110
(mouth full) I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
WITH MOVING, I FORGOT TO EAT.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.112
THIS IS REALLY GOOD, MOM.

33:33.112 --> 33:36.115
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW,
I'D MAKE IT FOR YOU EVERY DAY

33:36.115 --> 33:37.616
IF YOU'D MOVE BACK HOME.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.549
MOM, THIS...
THIS IS MY HOME.

33:40.549 --> 33:43.552
SERIOUSLY, ANDREW,
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A BED.

33:43.552 --> 33:46.395
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE SITTING ON IT.
IT'S A FOLDOUT.

33:46.395 --> 33:50.159
OH, DEAR GOD. AT LEAST LET ME
BUY YOU SOME DECENT FURNITURE.

33:50.159 --> 33:53.162
ABSOLUTELY NOT. MOM, I'M--
I'M GONNA DO THIS ON MY OWN.

33:53.162 --> 33:56.605
(sighs)
ANDREW, I UNDERSTAND

33:56.605 --> 33:59.808
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME
ABOUT WHAT I SAID, BUT...

33:59.808 --> 34:01.810
I DO HAVE A GOOD REASON

34:01.810 --> 34:03.812
FOR WANTING
TO RAISE BENJAMIN DIFFERENTLY.

34:03.812 --> 34:08.717
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST.
YOU PUT ME THROUGH HELL.

34:08.717 --> 34:11.080
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I-I KNOW I DID,

34:11.080 --> 34:13.322
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M MAD.

34:13.322 --> 34:16.655
BECAUSE I-I CHANGED,
AND YOU NEVER NOTICED.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.288
YOU KNOW,
I-I GOT A JOB, A CAR,

34:19.288 --> 34:21.489
MY OWN HEALTH INSURANCE.

34:21.489 --> 34:23.562
I'VE--
I'VE TURNED THINGS AROUND.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.464
WELL, I KNOW THAT.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.567
THEN WHY HAVEN'T YOU
SAID ANYTHING?

34:30.639 --> 34:33.172
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED

34:33.172 --> 34:35.404
ON YOUR NEW HUSBAND
AND BABY.

34:35.404 --> 34:37.176
OH, ANDREW.

34:37.176 --> 34:40.478
MOM, IT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GOT A NEW LIFE,

34:40.478 --> 34:43.152
AND I THINK IT'S TIME
I DID, TOO.

34:43.152 --> 34:46.685
I JUST DON'T WANT US TO PART
ON BAD TERMS AGAIN,

34:46.685 --> 34:48.687
LIKE WE DID TWO YEARS AGO.

34:48.687 --> 34:53.262
YOU MEAN WHEN YOU LEFT ME
ON THE SIDE OF THAT ROAD?

34:55.494 --> 34:57.326
LOOK, MOM...

34:57.326 --> 35:01.500
I WAS
SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.502
YOU FORCED ME TO GROW UP.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.476
IF I HAVEN'T SAID IT
BEFORE,

35:07.476 --> 35:09.438
THANK YOU.

35:09.438 --> 35:12.681
YOU FORGIVE ME?

35:12.681 --> 35:15.544
I FORGAVE YOU
A LONG TIME AGO.

35:15.544 --> 35:17.286
YOU JUST...

35:17.286 --> 35:21.450
YOU JUST NEVER NOTICED.

35:21.450 --> 35:25.194
OH, UH, MOM?

35:25.194 --> 35:29.198
UH, WOULD YOU MIND
USING A COASTER?

35:30.529 --> 35:32.301
OKAY. NOW I...

35:32.301 --> 35:35.334
I REALLYAMGONNA CRY.

35:37.306 --> 35:39.608
DAVE PASSED AWAY LAST SPRING.

35:39.608 --> 35:41.740
WE WERE TOGETHER
ALMOST 20 YEARS.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.172
OH.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.244
HE SEEMS NICE.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.247
I KNOW
IT'S A LOT TO DEAL WITH.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.249
KINDA.

35:50.249 --> 35:55.153
SO, UH,
COFFEE'S PROBABLY READY.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.525
UH, CREAM AND SUGAR?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.329
SHOT OF BOURBON?

36:05.194 --> 36:07.196
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

36:07.196 --> 36:11.200
IT WASN'T MY PROUDEST MOMENT,
LYNETTE.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.302
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:13.302 --> 36:16.705
I FAILED AS A WOMAN.

36:16.705 --> 36:20.349
TWO YEARS BEING MARRIED TO ME,
AND HE TURNS GAY.

36:20.349 --> 36:22.811
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

36:22.811 --> 36:24.413
ALL I KNOW IS

36:24.413 --> 36:27.656
I WAS... SO ASHAMED.

36:27.656 --> 36:30.289
WHAT DOES IT MATTER ANYWAY?

36:30.289 --> 36:32.961
IT WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED
ANYTHING BETWEEN US.

36:32.961 --> 36:34.463
ARE YOU KIDDING?

36:34.463 --> 36:37.266
IT WOULD'VE CHANGED
 EVERYTHING.

36:37.266 --> 36:41.199
OH, Y-YOU WOULD'VE GIVEN ME
A PASS ON MY DRINKING

36:41.199 --> 36:43.772
AND MY--MY SWEARING,
MY--MY MEN?

36:43.772 --> 36:47.276
IF I UNDERSTOODWHYYOU COULDN'T
STAY MARRIED TO THE ONLY FATHER,

36:47.276 --> 36:49.778
THE ONLY STABLE PARENT
I'D EVER KNOWN,

36:49.778 --> 36:51.780
YEAH, I COULD'VE FOUND A WAY

36:51.780 --> 36:54.313
TO FORGIVE YOU
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

36:56.285 --> 36:58.687
WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

36:58.687 --> 37:00.419
LET'S GO HOME.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.321
I DON'T THINK SO.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.323
LISTEN TO ME.

37:04.323 --> 37:07.326
I WOULD BE HONORED IF YOU
WOULD COME AND LIVE WITH US.

37:07.326 --> 37:10.799
HAVING YOU AROUND THESE
PAST FEW MONTHS WAS SORT OF...

37:10.799 --> 37:12.431
FUN.

37:12.431 --> 37:16.265
(chuckles) IT WASGREAT.

37:16.265 --> 37:19.708
WE ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO STOP TORTURING EACH OTHER.

37:19.708 --> 37:21.610
THEN WHY NOT COME BACK?

37:21.610 --> 37:24.743
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO SCREW THAT UP,

37:24.743 --> 37:27.516
AND LET'S FACE IT, LYNETTE.
YOU KNOW I WOULD.

37:27.516 --> 37:31.320
SO WHY DON'T
WE JUST TAKE OUR CHIPS

37:31.320 --> 37:33.782
AND LEAVE THE TABLE
WINNERS?

37:33.782 --> 37:37.486
BUT WHERE WILL YOU LIVE?

37:37.486 --> 37:41.490
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A THOUGHT.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.992
UH, SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO EAVESDROP,

37:43.992 --> 37:46.264
BUT, UM...

37:46.264 --> 37:47.896
I HAPPEN TO HAVE

37:47.896 --> 37:50.699
AN IMMACULATELY DECORATED
GUEST ROOM.

37:50.699 --> 37:53.872
YOU KNOW,
HE'S ALWAYS TALKED LIKE THAT.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.405
HOW DID I NOT KNOW
YOU WERE QUEER?

37:56.405 --> 37:59.478
(laughs)
 I'M SORRY.
YOUWANTTHIS AROUND?

37:59.478 --> 38:02.751
WELL,
WE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD TIME,

38:02.751 --> 38:06.284
AND TO TELL THE TRUTH, I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE LONELY LATELY.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.487
OH.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.989
SO I WOULD BE DOING YOU
A FAVOR.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.421
HMM.

38:12.421 --> 38:14.663
FINE,
BUT I'M KEEPING THE MONEY.

38:14.663 --> 38:17.796
(laughs) IT'S A DEAL.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.798
DOES THIS WORK FOR YOU?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.300
IT DOES.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.932
IT REALLY DOES.

38:32.381 --> 38:34.683
SO I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME STRETCHES,

38:34.683 --> 38:37.616
AND THE SHOULDER FEELS GREAT.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.017
THAT'S A RELIEF.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.019
YOU, UH,
GONNA TAKE A SHOWER?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.791
YEAH.

38:42.791 --> 38:45.654
I MIGHT, UM, GO DOWN
FOR A SNACK IN A MINUTE.

38:45.654 --> 38:47.025
OKAY.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.026
(door shuts)

38:48.026 --> 38:49.598
(sighs)

38:49.598 --> 38:51.760
(water running)

39:05.374 --> 39:06.675
(truck door shuts)

39:08.016 --> 39:10.779
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

39:15.353 --> 39:17.055
MRS. LANG?

39:17.055 --> 39:19.788
UH, I'M DR. WHEELER,
YOUR HUSBAND'S NEUROLOGIST.

39:19.788 --> 39:22.791
HOW IS HE?
 UH, HE'S STARTING
TO WAKE UP NOW.

39:22.791 --> 39:24.793
WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TALK TO HIM?

39:24.793 --> 39:27.796
OF COURSE!
I-I BET HE'S PRETTY DELIRIOUS.

39:27.796 --> 39:30.098
I MEAN, AFTER HIS ORDEAL,
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

39:30.098 --> 39:33.572
IF HE'S JUST BABBLING LIKE
A CRAZY PERSON!

39:33.572 --> 39:36.374
(laughs nervously)

39:37.946 --> 39:41.780
(Dr. Wheeler)
MR. LANG, YOUR WIFE IS HERE.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.716
GABY. HI.

39:47.716 --> 39:49.488
DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF,
VICTOR.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.790
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
TO TALK LATER.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.792
WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW
IS THAT YOU REST.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.795
JUST STAY QUIET AND REST...
QUIETLY.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.797
MR. MAYOR,
I'M DETECTIVE BERRY.

39:58.797 --> 40:02.070
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

40:02.070 --> 40:04.873
WHAT TIME DID YOU
TAKE YOUR BOAT OUT?

40:04.873 --> 40:07.606
I WAS ON THE BOAT?

40:07.606 --> 40:10.779
WE THINK. WE FOUND IT FLOATING
IN THE BAY, AND, UH, OBVIOUSLY,

40:10.779 --> 40:12.811
YOU'D BEEN IN THE WATER
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

40:12.811 --> 40:16.885
UH, THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER...

40:16.885 --> 40:20.018
WAS FRIDAY'S STAFF MEETING.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.850
REALLY?

40:21.850 --> 40:24.152
I MEAN, WHAT?

40:24.152 --> 40:27.195
GABY, DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT ME BEING ON THE BOAT?

40:27.195 --> 40:29.197
NO.

40:29.197 --> 40:31.129
NO.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.562
SORRY.

40:33.562 --> 40:35.664
I GUESS
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

40:35.664 --> 40:37.866
NOT UNCOMMON
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

40:37.866 --> 40:39.868
HE'S SUFFERED
BOTH A MILD CONCUSSION

40:39.868 --> 40:41.009
AND HYPOTHERMIA,

40:41.009 --> 40:44.943
EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT
IN MEMORY LOSS.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.815
WELL, WHO CARES?

40:46.815 --> 40:48.817
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT HE'S SAFE,

40:48.817 --> 40:51.119
AND WE'RE GONNA NURSE YOU
BACK TO HEALTH,

40:51.119 --> 40:54.483
AND I THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN
A LOT FASTER

40:54.483 --> 40:56.024
IF WE ALL CLEAR OUT.

40:56.024 --> 40:57.986
THANK YOU.

40:57.986 --> 41:01.229
GABY, CAN YOU STAY WITH ME
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

41:01.229 --> 41:03.832
OF COURSE.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.469
(sighs) SOUNDS LIKE I WAS
IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE THERE.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.472
BUT YOU'RE OKAY NOW.
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.145
(whispers) COME HERE.

41:22.911 --> 41:25.153
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

41:27.586 --> 41:28.857
WHAT?

41:28.857 --> 41:32.260
I THINK IWILLREST NOW.

41:33.822 --> 41:36.525
I'M GONNA NEED
ALL MY STRENGTH.

41:50.609 --> 41:54.282
THE PAST
IS NEVER TRULY BEHIND US.

41:54.282 --> 41:55.914
(reporters speaking at once)

41:55.914 --> 41:58.116
GHOSTS LURK IN THE SHADOWS,

41:58.116 --> 42:03.722
EAGER TO REMIND US
OF THE CHOICES WE MADE.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.724
BUT IF WE LOOK BACK,

42:05.724 --> 42:10.899
WE MIGHT FIND AN OLD FRIEND
WITH OPEN ARMS...

42:12.731 --> 42:16.835
OR AN OLD ENEMY
WITH A HIDDEN AGENDA...

42:19.137 --> 42:21.910
OR A GROWN-UP SON

42:21.910 --> 42:25.774
WITH A FORGIVING HEART...

42:25.774 --> 42:31.019
SADLY, SOME OF US
REFUSE TO LOOK BACK,

42:31.019 --> 42:35.754
NEVER UNDERSTANDING
THAT BY DENYING THE PAST...

42:35.754 --> 42:38.056
WE ARE CONDEMNED...

42:38.056 --> 42:40.058
TO REPEAT IT.
