10:29.895 --> 10:33.799
Under here is a vegetable.
It's green on the outside,

10:33.866 --> 10:37.403
but yellow on the inside,
and it grows on the cob.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.205
ALL: Hmm...

10:39.271 --> 10:41.607
Mr. Grouper?

10:41.674 --> 10:44.610
ALL: Corn!
(Laughing)

10:44.677 --> 10:46.412
Corn.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.181
(Chattering)

10:49.248 --> 10:51.050
Now, everybody, dig in.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.186
(Chattering)

10:54.253 --> 10:56.455
Mmm... tomatoes!

10:56.522 --> 10:59.492
{\an5}Mmm...

10:56.522 --> 10:59.492
Deema, want some broccoli?

11:02.561 --> 11:05.731
It's yummy, crunchy.

11:05.798 --> 11:09.502
Hmm... I'm not
ready to try it yet.

11:09.568 --> 11:12.338
Line up, all you

Once upon a time...

11:42.835 --> 11:46.872
there were two space farmers
who were getting ready

11:46.939 --> 11:49.175
to take their fruits
and vegetables to the market

11:49.241 --> 11:51.677
far, far away on another planet.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.146
Those apples sure
look delicious.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.881
So do these carrots.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.583
Let's get them
to the market

11:57.650 --> 11:59.585
while they're
still nice and ripe

11:59.652 --> 12:02.221
"Ripe" means ready to eat.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.523
Ripe apples
are delicious.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.126
{\an5}OONA:
But before
they were ready to go...

12:07.193 --> 12:08.561
(Sniffing)

12:08.627 --> 12:10.963
Uh, Farmer Nonny,
what's that smell?

12:11.030 --> 12:13.365
I don't know, Farmer Goby,

12:13.432 --> 12:17.269
but it sure doesn't
smell ripe. It smells...

12:17.336 --> 12:19.004
BOTH:
Rotten!

12:19.071 --> 12:20.439
(Laughing evilly)

12:20.506 --> 12:22.508
Guess who's back!

12:22.575 --> 12:24.777
BOTH:
Rotten Tomato!

12:24.844 --> 12:28.948
That's right, and I'm going to
make your apples all rotten.

12:29.014 --> 12:31.550
(Laughing)

12:35.521 --> 12:37.857
GOBY:
My apples!

12:37.923 --> 12:39.091
{\an1}(Laughing)

12:39.158 --> 12:41.393
And now, I'm going
to make all your fruits

12:41.460 --> 12:43.362
and veggies rotten.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.531
Let's get out of here!

12:51.003 --> 12:54.206
Phew! That was close.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.208
We'd better
deliver our produce

12:56.275 --> 12:59.211
before Rotten Tomato
turns it all rotten.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.881
"Produce" means
fruits and vegetables.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.518
OONA:
So, the farmers hurried

13:05.584 --> 13:07.419
to deliver their
fruits and vegetables

13:07.486 --> 13:11.490
to the farmer's market
on Produce Planet.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.826
Here's the lettuce.

13:13.893 --> 13:17.129
And here are
the oranges, perfectly ripe.

13:17.196 --> 13:20.332
(Sniffing)
Not again.

13:20.399 --> 13:23.569
BOTH:
Rotten Tomato!

13:23.636 --> 13:26.872
Time to rot and roll, dudes.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.645
{\an6}My lettuce.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.645
My oranges!

13:34.246 --> 13:35.915
(Laughing)

13:35.981 --> 13:37.316
Let's get out of here

13:37.383 --> 13:40.586
before he makes
everything rotten.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.723
(Laughing)

13:46.792 --> 13:49.328
(Laughing)

13:51.163 --> 13:53.699
Hmm?

13:56.802 --> 13:59.038
NONNY:
I think we lost him.

13:59.104 --> 14:02.474
Farmer Nonny, prepare
to jump to super space.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.184
{\an5}NONNY:
Space supermarket
ahead, Farmer Goby.

14:12.251 --> 14:16.922
{\an5}OONA:
And so, the space farmers
went to the space supermarket

14:16.989 --> 14:18.490
to deliver their produce.

14:18.557 --> 14:21.126
We have to put everything
in the right places.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.929
Green vegetables go here.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.768
And radishes are red,
so they go here.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.975
{\an5}COMPUTER:
<i>Warning,</i>
<i>Rotten Tomato approaching.</i>

14:36.041 --> 14:37.643
He's found us!

14:37.710 --> 14:39.745
We need your help to match
the last of the vegetables

14:39.812 --> 14:44.250
with the right color
before Rotten Tomato gets here.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.285
These are the eggplants.

14:46.352 --> 14:49.288
Do they go here or here?

14:52.992 --> 14:55.928
Here, the eggplants go here.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.530
{\an1}Right!

14:58.597 --> 15:01.500
And that means that
the sweet potatoes go here.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.640
We did it!

15:07.706 --> 15:10.242
Warning, Rotten Tomato is here.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.344
{\an1}(Laughing)

15:12.411 --> 15:14.680
No, please don't
make our fruit rotten.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.149
Don't ruin our ripe produce.

15:17.216 --> 15:18.784
(Laughing)

15:18.851 --> 15:20.819
Your what produce?

15:20.886 --> 15:22.154
BOTH: Ripe.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.657
Here, try some.

15:27.459 --> 15:31.997
That's...
that's so delicious.

15:32.064 --> 15:33.799
BOTH: Mm-hmm.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.101
(Sobbing)

15:36.168 --> 15:37.736
What have I done?

15:37.803 --> 15:40.806
I don't want to make
things rotten anymore.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.309
I want to make
rotten things ripe.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.845
{\an1}(Sobbing)

15:46.912 --> 15:50.182
You can help us grow
more fruits and vegetables.

15:50.249 --> 15:51.817
If you want to.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.552
Yes!

15:53.619 --> 15:55.387
OONA:
And so, Rotten Tomato

15:55.454 --> 15:58.390
and the space farmers
became friends,

15:58.457 --> 16:01.160
and together, they grew
the best produce in the galaxy.

16:01.226 --> 16:04.530
Everything is
so perfectly ripe!

16:04.596 --> 16:06.865
Well, except for me.
I'll always be rotten.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.801
(Laughing)

16:08.867 --> 16:12.037
And they all lived
happily ever after.

17:38.190 --> 17:42.261
No, this time I'm going
