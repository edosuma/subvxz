00:37.970 --> 00:41.104
Wickedness had overtaken
the people of Sodom & Gomorrah to a

00:41.106 --> 00:45.208
point of no return. Its people
were seduced, possessed and

00:45.210 --> 00:50.212
controlled by an ancient evil.
This angered God. God's only

00:50.214 --> 00:53.116
choice was to destroy these
cities to preserve mankind and

00:53.118 --> 00:57.754
all that is good. A man named
Lot, considered by God to be the

00:57.756 --> 01:01.958
last of the righteous, abided in
these wicked cities. God would

01:01.960 --> 01:05.762
not destroy the cities with this
righteous man dwelling within.

01:05.764 --> 01:10.232
Lot and his family were visited
by two strangers... men, not of

01:10.234 --> 01:13.769
this world. These men were to
rescue Lot and those with him

01:13.771 --> 01:17.774
before God destroyed the cities.
Word spread throughout Sodom &

01:17.776 --> 01:20.676
Gomorrah of the visitors'
presence at the home of Lot.

01:20.678 --> 01:24.146
Discerning the impending
danger a visitor signaled Lot.

01:24.148 --> 01:27.684
The wicked men of Sodom and
Gomorrah surrounded the house

01:27.686 --> 01:30.619
and demanded that the two
visitors be released to them,

01:30.621 --> 01:34.723
they may take them and have
them... sexually. Perceiving the

01:34.725 --> 01:38.161
men to be holy angels sent by
God, did all he could to protect

01:38.163 --> 01:41.864
them; even offering his two
daughters instead.

01:41.866 --> 01:45.101
Lilith, the ancient
evil spoke saying...

01:45.103 --> 01:47.836
"Join me
and I will let these men go

01:47.838 --> 01:50.973
freely." One of the visitors
quickly grabbed Lot, "We must

01:50.975 --> 01:54.077
leave now, there is no
redemption for these cities." As

01:54.079 --> 01:57.613
the men of Sodom & Gomorrah
rushed the home the visitors

01:57.615 --> 02:01.051
unleashed blinding rays of
light, enough for Lot and his

02:01.053 --> 02:06.155
family to escape safely as God
completely destroyed the cities.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.067
And good evening. I'm
Leigh Warring and, thank you for

02:18.069 --> 02:22.271
joining me. For over 2000 years,
Christians have been trying to

02:22.273 --> 02:26.342
convince the world that their
belief is the only way. You know

02:26.344 --> 02:30.045
every religion has a salesman.
I'm referring to it's religious

02:30.047 --> 02:34.283
leaders. The kickbacks are out
of this world, thanks to you,

02:34.285 --> 02:35.885
the followers.

02:35.887 --> 02:38.922
Arrested tonight in
downtown Atlanta, Pastor Avery Malone

02:38.924 --> 02:42.626
of Christlike Ministries. The
married father of 4 was caught

02:42.628 --> 02:48.031
drunk driving on route 402 with
an unidentified woman.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.866
But they're selling
you an invisible product.

02:50.868 --> 02:55.905
Something that can't actually be
verified until the day you die.

02:55.907 --> 02:59.309
12 prominent church
leaders from surrounding counties are under

02:59.311 --> 03:03.079
federal investigation.
These allegations include money

03:03.081 --> 03:05.048
laundering and mail fraud.

03:05.050 --> 03:08.283
But by that time, if
it's proven not to be true...

03:08.285 --> 03:16.059
Sorry no refunds. You're going
to a... paradise, a heaven...

03:16.061 --> 03:17.360
Really?

03:17.362 --> 03:19.795
You say that
Albert Charles is lying about you

03:19.797 --> 03:21.465
being addicted to
prescription drugs...

03:21.467 --> 03:24.099
Absolutely and I
have said it time over and over again...

03:24.101 --> 03:27.137
Wait... He...wait, wait...
He even claims when high, you

03:27.139 --> 03:28.905
- participated in sexual acts...
- No...

03:28.907 --> 03:30.073
- With other men...
- No.

03:30.075 --> 03:31.307
...since the early 90's.

03:31.309 --> 03:36.145
No he's trippin'... I've only
had affairs with three women...

03:36.147 --> 03:36.813
Three!?

03:36.815 --> 03:37.815
What!?

03:37.817 --> 03:39.948
Oh I'm sorry, did I say
three I meant one...

03:39.950 --> 03:42.185
From childhood, we've
been taught over and over again

03:42.187 --> 03:44.387
about fictional stories of men

03:44.389 --> 03:47.757
who knew nothing about science,
chemistry, the solar system or

03:47.759 --> 03:52.861
better yet where the sun goes
at night. Yet, they can tell you

03:52.863 --> 03:54.062
about the afterlife.

03:54.064 --> 03:57.167
Another prominent church leader
in the city of Atlanta has

03:57.169 --> 04:02.271
resigned today over allegations
of hiring male prostitutes.

04:02.273 --> 04:07.276
These places, they
create fear in people, mass

04:07.278 --> 04:11.047
delusion, and we need to rid
ourselves and generations to

04:11.049 --> 04:15.050
come of these fairy tales.

04:15.052 --> 04:18.120
That's
your 3 minute update for sports!

04:18.123 --> 04:21.190
Thank you Kathleen.
Well, there seems to be brighter

04:21.192 --> 04:24.326
days for the church community
at-large especially here in

04:24.328 --> 04:27.429
Atlanta. Despite multiple
scandals that have rocked the

04:27.431 --> 04:31.333
core of the Christian community,
a beacon of light shines bright.

04:31.335 --> 04:34.169
His name,
Pastor Robert J. Knight.

04:34.171 --> 04:35.938
He is the founding Pastor of

04:35.940 --> 04:39.374
abundant life Ministries of
Atlanta. The Pastor and his wife

04:39.376 --> 04:42.979
Tammy Knight's outreach ministry
has been serving the community

04:42.981 --> 04:46.381
with food banks, after school
programs as well as job training

04:46.383 --> 04:49.152
centers throughout the city.
Despite the scandals that are

04:49.154 --> 04:52.255
plaguing the church community,
their membership is up to an

04:52.257 --> 04:56.859
astonishing 6500 and growing.

05:41.472 --> 05:45.040
What took you so long?

05:45.042 --> 05:47.210
I wasn't sure I was coming.

05:47.212 --> 05:52.080
Why, am I not all you imagined?

05:52.082 --> 05:54.883
I can't get you off my mind.

05:54.885 --> 05:59.090
It's all for you Bobby.

06:03.995 --> 06:08.000
I smelled you from a mile away.

06:11.101 --> 06:14.806
You're so beautiful.

06:26.484 --> 06:29.251
What's wrong?

06:29.253 --> 06:34.323
Uh... Nothing, nothing, nothing.

06:39.330 --> 06:43.165
I'll take care of you.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.342
You're so beautiful.

06:54.979 --> 06:59.414
I'm all yours.

07:21.306 --> 07:29.011
Ow! That hurt... Oh my God, I'm
bleeding! What are you doing?

07:31.916 --> 07:36.986
Sorry
I got a little carried away.

07:36.988 --> 07:41.623
That really hurt.

07:41.625 --> 07:46.162
I wonder what kind of lie your
gonna tell your wife when she

07:46.164 --> 07:48.563
sees these scars?

07:48.565 --> 07:52.669
Why would you say
something like that?

07:52.671 --> 07:54.671
We should... Stop...

07:54.673 --> 07:56.338
- Why pastor?
- What was that? What was that?

07:56.340 --> 07:58.273
Isn't this what you wanted?

08:02.147 --> 08:03.080
Clean sweep of this lobby...

08:03.082 --> 08:04.246
Will somebody get him!

08:04.248 --> 08:05.080
Shut it down now...

08:05.082 --> 08:06.116
Come on people.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.083
We gotta keep a lid
on this as long as we can!

08:08.085 --> 08:09.686
It's about time...

08:09.688 --> 08:10.953
What happened
here? I just got the call from Reagan.

08:10.955 --> 08:13.957
You ain't
gonna believe this, come on.

08:13.959 --> 08:14.691
Who's the victim?

08:14.693 --> 08:18.094
Pastor Robert J. Knight.

08:18.096 --> 08:21.229
You've got to be kidding me...

08:21.231 --> 08:22.465
Was he alone?

08:22.467 --> 08:25.467
No, but he's the only homicide.
They're up there dusting for

08:25.469 --> 08:27.102
prints now.

08:27.104 --> 08:29.272
Where's his wife?

08:29.274 --> 08:33.676
Home I guess. She thinks he's
on a mission trip to Africa.

08:33.678 --> 08:34.710
This is not good.

08:34.712 --> 08:36.244
Yeah but there's one more thing.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.013
What?

08:37.015 --> 08:41.083
Your serial killer
might be back.

08:41.086 --> 08:42.652
Nobody in, nobody out!

08:42.654 --> 08:46.258
Yes sir.

08:47.625 --> 08:52.063
Oh, God? Well.

09:00.005 --> 09:03.105
Well from the looks
of it, our suspect might be a

09:03.107 --> 09:08.543
woman... chicky boom boom.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.718
I understand, you all

09:15.720 --> 09:20.757
need to reconsider.
I've known this kid for years.

09:20.759 --> 09:23.759
Jeremiah takes
some getting used to...

09:23.761 --> 09:26.763
We been
through this multiple times.

09:26.765 --> 09:30.199
I don't want to be responsible
if something happens.

09:30.201 --> 09:32.502
Kids like him snap you know?

09:32.504 --> 09:37.606
CHARLES BURTON SOCIAL WORKER He's harmless.
He's just quiet, stays to himself.

09:37.608 --> 09:43.579
Please uhh... we've all been
through rough times Ms. Morris.

09:43.581 --> 09:46.081
We all have a past...

09:46.083 --> 09:53.455
Yes, Charles we do,
but no one seems to know his.

09:53.457 --> 09:57.759
Look... I know
you know what's going on.

09:57.761 --> 10:02.764
We've been down this road
before. You just gotta go back

10:02.766 --> 10:09.839
to the group home, just for a
little while. I was hoping Ms.

10:09.841 --> 10:15.777
Morris would reconsider before
you started at UMT but...

10:15.779 --> 10:24.619
We try so hard to fit in, but
maybe we aren't supposed to.

10:24.621 --> 10:27.790
We're not weird, they are.

10:27.792 --> 10:33.830
Okay. Come on let's get out of
here. Get your seatbelt.

10:40.505 --> 10:43.205
Reid! Press is waiting.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.740
Here's that
serial killer story that's been breaking.

10:45.742 --> 10:48.344
There have been several
internal leaks to the media

10:48.346 --> 10:52.114
regarding a murder of a
high profile person.

10:52.116 --> 10:55.750
And I'm here to
confirm the victim is

10:55.752 --> 10:57.452
Pastor Robert J. Knight

10:57.454 --> 10:59.855
of Abundant Life Ministries.

10:59.857 --> 11:04.393
This is a homicide, so, I
must be careful what I share.

11:04.395 --> 11:06.128
Detective
Reid, I heard the crime

11:06.130 --> 11:09.165
scene was horrific...
Could you comment on that?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.633
No.

11:10.635 --> 11:13.369
Some fear that this may
be the work of a serial killer your

11:13.371 --> 11:15.437
department lost
track of years ago.

11:15.439 --> 11:16.205
We can't comment on that.

11:16.207 --> 11:18.574
Is this murder
related in anyway?

11:18.576 --> 11:20.542
What can you answer Detective?

11:20.544 --> 11:23.178
Why was the Pastor there
when he was supposed to be on a

11:23.180 --> 11:25.480
mission's trip in Africa.

11:25.482 --> 11:29.351
No more questions.

11:29.353 --> 11:35.224
Jeremiah... Jeremiah.

11:39.731 --> 11:45.301
Jeremiah.

12:05.656 --> 12:08.824

12:51.568 --> 12:52.969

You're day dreaming.

12:56.241 --> 12:57.706

This should warm you up.

13:15.393 --> 13:25.404
Jeremiah, you know you
can always talk to me.

13:26.371 --> 13:28.271
He was trying to
tell me something.

13:28.273 --> 13:30.873
Who? Who are you talking about?

13:35.779 --> 13:37.680
I don't know,

13:37.682 --> 13:39.648
You were sleep

what that's like?

14:06.476 --> 14:08.944
You forget I was with
you since the beginning.

14:08.946 --> 14:13.316
When you were
first brought here.

14:13.318 --> 14:17.552
I'm sorry I don't count
like a real father would...

14:17.554 --> 14:22.325

14:22.327 --> 14:26.698
You were never alone.

14:48.919 --> 14:51.086

I don't know about you but
just wanted to tell you that I'm

16:28.819 --> 16:34.690
proud of you Jeremiah. To me

Anyway... they got all your

17:14.765 --> 17:16.732
Alright, is it me or

17:19.836 --> 17:22.771
400 percent to comp
everyone give it up for him.

17:22.772 --> 17:24.673
That's record breaking.

17:24.675 --> 17:28.910
What can I say. Alright...

17:28.912 --> 17:32.615
If we look at what we did
last year compared to this

17:32.617 --> 17:36.819
year... this is what
we got to do.

17:42.259 --> 17:43.626
This is...

17:43.628 --> 17:48.930

Atlanta, a university on the rise.

18:53.331 --> 18:55.898
Attendance is up 110%

19:00.103 --> 19:01.637
Excuse me...

19:01.639 --> 19:04.138

missing. Authorities fear the

19:04.140 --> 19:05.607
worst...

college experience especially because

Soccer team?

You a swimmer?

19:46.083 --> 19:49.350
No I'm just... I'm just
a student here.

19:49.352 --> 19:51.253
Now you sure you're suppose to
be here, this place right here

19:51.255 --> 19:52.253
for athletes.

19:52.255 --> 19:57.693
Yeah yeah yeah, I got my
ahhh... I have my...

19:57.695 --> 20:01.397
My room assignment right here.
Umm, it... 324, and I have the

20:01.399 --> 20:03.131
keys too so I just...

20:03.133 --> 20:05.234
Oh, God.

20:05.236 --> 20:08.404
Uhh... what's your name?

20:08.406 --> 20:11.005
Wow... Well I uhh... I

20:11.007 --> 20:14.810
of your universities football
games? I'm Peter Johnson.

20:14.812 --> 20:18.813
Oh, yeah, I haven't... I
haven't caught one yet.

20:18.815 --> 20:21.849
I just got here.

20:21.851 --> 20:25.023
Obviously.

20:26.157 --> 20:30.024
You don't, you don't
have any uhm... weird habits or

20:30.026 --> 20:33.762
anything like that do you?
Cause like you look just like my

20:33.764 --> 20:36.898
roommate and he
was a soccer player.

20:36.900 --> 20:41.904
No, no not that I know of.

20:41.906 --> 20:45.440
You know what, I'ma be upfront
with you my man. If I find you

20:45.442 --> 20:47.341
in my stuff... if I find anything
missing we gonna have a

20:47.343 --> 20:48.510
- situation.
- Ok...

20:48.512 --> 20:51.480
Ok, you respect my space I
respect yours. Clean up after

20:51.482 --> 20:52.848
yourself and we're good, cool?

20:52.850 --> 20:57.789
Cool, yeah cool... respect.

20:58.155 --> 21:02.925
Faith and religion.
Faith and religion that's the

21:02.927 --> 21:08.964
same thing isn't it... no?
Well what's the difference?

21:08.966 --> 21:13.368
Is there a difference? Welcome
to Religion 101 where we'll

21:13.370 --> 21:18.340
discuss that and
other aspects of Christianity.

21:18.342 --> 21:21.476
Now most people and I'm sure
that includes some of us, have a

21:21.478 --> 21:26.314
tough time with the
concept of Faith and Religion.

21:26.316 --> 21:31.853
I don't know maybe it's because
all we see are pagan rituals.

21:31.855 --> 21:36.023
We don't see a lifestyle, we
don't see a way of life.

21:36.025 --> 21:38.226
So what do we know
really, what do we know?

21:38.228 --> 21:42.830
Let's see, we know that
Christians believe that God or a

21:42.832 --> 21:49.103
form of God was born to a virgin
and then later was crucified.

21:49.105 --> 21:52.073
Jesus died on the cross or in

21:52.075 --> 21:59.380
faith terms gave his life to
save a dying world... and that

21:59.382 --> 22:06.288
ladies and gentleman, that,
has empowered mankind to destroy

22:06.290 --> 22:09.424
evil.

22:09.426 --> 22:12.327
Open your books to
page 321 please.

22:12.329 --> 22:15.531
Stop don't touch me, no...

22:15.533 --> 22:17.899
I want that...

22:17.901 --> 22:23.440
Fine, fine.

22:32.015 --> 22:35.452
C'mon, c'mon, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up...

22:36.187 --> 22:42.390
Listen you need to get down
here. I don't know what this is.

22:42.392 --> 22:44.560
It looks like something from the
inside of the victim tore right

22:44.562 --> 22:46.895
through him.

22:46.897 --> 22:50.135
Yeah, hurry up, man.

22:50.900 --> 22:53.836
Hello Mr. Young I'm
Doctor Kacy. How are you feeling?

22:53.838 --> 22:57.505
I'm... I'm alright. I just, uhh,
have a little bit of a headache.

22:57.507 --> 22:59.107
We can prescribe
something for that?

22:59.109 --> 23:00.975
No I don't... I don't need
anything I'm good.

23:00.977 --> 23:05.480
Well, the important
thing is the police officers are

23:05.482 --> 23:09.618
willing to drop the charges if
your willing to get some help,

23:09.620 --> 23:13.120
because evidently
you've had some, episode.

23:13.122 --> 23:14.889
Episode... what do you mean
episode? What's that...

23:14.891 --> 23:16.023
What episode?

23:16.025 --> 23:22.196
Hello, how do you know me?

23:22.198 --> 23:26.935
You're a sleep walker Mr. Young
and I'm gonna recommend you see

23:26.937 --> 23:29.036

23:29.038 --> 23:33.310
Alright, okay... yeah.

24:29.033 --> 24:33.334
God...

24:33.336 --> 24:41.211
Please, forgive me.

24:42.345 --> 24:48.652
No one cares.

24:55.559 --> 25:01.032

25:16.980 --> 25:21.652

I saw it happen to you. Uhh.

25:32.161 --> 25:37.499
With my own eyes I saw it.
I know why you're here.

25:56.186 --> 25:58.486

25:58.488 --> 26:06.363
You're embarrassed cause
there's no one to turn to.

26:07.598 --> 26:13.534
You're not the bad guy, just so
you know. He's the bad guy.

26:13.536 --> 26:20.207
You're... You're a
good person.

26:20.209 --> 26:25.446
You're good.

27:06.723 --> 27:11.092

30:16.679 --> 30:18.780
Get your stuff and go...

30:18.782 --> 30:20.482

Alright.

30:32.028 --> 30:37.834

30:42.406 --> 30:46.777
I'm sorry Pete.

30:57.888 --> 31:04.359
Jeremiah! I thought that was
you. Thank God you're ok.

31:04.361 --> 31:05.827
What are you doing here?

31:05.829 --> 31:08.562
We got a call that
you were in the hospital.

31:08.564 --> 31:11.733
Yeah, yeah...

31:11.735 --> 31:13.534
With all that's going on out
here I just thought it would a

31:13.536 --> 31:15.803
good idea to check
up on you that's all.

31:15.805 --> 31:18.072
I appreciate that.

31:18.074 --> 31:21.342
And what are you
doing sitting out here?

31:21.344 --> 31:24.681
Uhh... you know...

31:25.748 --> 31:29.516
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a walk.

31:29.518 --> 31:34.089
Gentleman, we need you to clear
this area. A campus lock down is

31:34.091 --> 31:35.622
going into effect.

31:35.624 --> 31:38.626
Oh, what seems to
be the problem?

31:38.628 --> 31:40.962
A couple of students
have gone missing.

31:40.964 --> 31:44.099
You've got to be kidding me.

31:44.101 --> 31:46.501
Everyone inside alright.

31:46.503 --> 31:48.102
Yes, sir.

31:48.104 --> 31:50.671
No new leads but new
victims. I got the chief up on

31:50.673 --> 31:53.440
my back and God knows how far
this has reached in the media.

31:53.442 --> 31:55.909
Any day now the US Attorney
General will walk through these

31:55.911 --> 31:57.512
doors and nobodies job is safe!

31:57.514 --> 31:59.714
We're... we're trying to narrow
down the connections now.

31:59.716 --> 32:01.049
We don't have
anything Dahistrom!

32:01.051 --> 32:02.751
Every lead we
had went cold.

32:02.753 --> 32:04.953
It's been 10 years and this
monster decides to show up

32:04.955 --> 32:05.954
again.

32:05.956 --> 32:08.790
Hey... hey Reid, I left
that file on your desk.

32:08.792 --> 32:10.692
Alright but what about the
female clothing we found at the

32:10.694 --> 32:11.693
crime scene?

32:11.695 --> 32:13.160
I'm not counting
it out but there's no way a

32:13.162 --> 32:15.597
woman can rip
apart a man like this.

32:15.599 --> 32:18.599
I think it's to
throw us off.

32:18.601 --> 32:21.403
Yeah, well we can't rule
out copycats either.

32:21.405 --> 32:23.538
That could complicate
the situation even more.

32:23.540 --> 32:26.507
Ah yeah, the suspect
is a white male, approximately 5...

32:26.509 --> 32:28.943
Reid, listen...

32:28.945 --> 32:32.446
We all know you've been
on this case since day one.

32:32.448 --> 32:34.448
I personally hate to
see you like this.

32:34.450 --> 32:36.684
What are you talking about?

32:36.686 --> 32:39.620
Man this case... this
case broke up your family.

32:39.622 --> 32:42.023
It took your joy of
being a detective away.

32:42.025 --> 32:44.492
All I'm saying is... there's
something happening

32:44.494 --> 32:47.829
in this city that is
just plain scary.

32:47.831 --> 32:51.899
I need you and your team
to review those surveillance

32:51.901 --> 32:54.636
videos again.

32:54.638 --> 32:56.937
Dahistrom?

32:56.939 --> 33:02.813
I need you to be
with me on this, you got it?

33:05.849 --> 33:08.953
Yeah I got it.

33:18.995 --> 33:24.198
Hey! Hi.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.033
Hi, hi.

you for what you did.

50:44.006 --> 50:46.874
- No..
- Did you see who did this?

50:46.876 --> 50:47.975
Basement level...

50:47.977 --> 50:50.077
Who did this?

50:50.079 --> 50:59.785
Sa... Satan. Satan.
Satan. Satan. Satan!

50:59.787 --> 51:03.524
Now we all know the story of
Adam and Eve right?

51:03.526 --> 51:06.526
Genesis,
paradise you got

51:06.528 --> 51:11.798
the snake, the apple, paradise
lost, what if there's more? What

51:11.800 --> 51:20.707
if something was left out? The
book of Genesis verse 27, 28.

51:20.709 --> 51:22.209
- Hey do you mind?
- Yeah.

51:22.211 --> 51:26.747
Now pay close
attention, 27...

51:26.749 --> 51:28.615
So God created man in

51:28.617 --> 51:32.753
his own image, in the image of
God created he him; male and

51:32.755 --> 51:39.695
female create he them.

51:41.162 --> 51:44.997
Huh. Alright, that's nice.
Makes sense, ok. 28?

51:44.999 --> 51:49.068
God commands them to be
fruitful and multiply.

51:49.070 --> 51:53.740
Commands them to be fruitful
and multiply. Ok, thank you.

51:53.742 --> 52:00.680
Now let's go to chapter 2.

52:00.682 --> 52:02.749
Do you mind?
Thank you.

52:02.751 --> 52:08.287
18 and 23
impart. 18 go...

52:08.289 --> 52:11.591
God said it is not good
for man to be alone?

52:11.593 --> 52:13.994
I will make
an helper fit for him?

52:13.996 --> 52:15.227
21.

52:15.229 --> 52:19.600
God caused a deep
sleep to fall upon Adam.

52:19.602 --> 52:22.001
He took one of his
ribs and made a woman and

52:22.003 --> 52:30.010
brought her unto man.

52:30.012 --> 52:31.211
23, go.

52:31.213 --> 52:34.615
It is now bone of my bone,
flesh of my flesh and she shall

52:34.617 --> 52:37.316
be called woman because
she was taken out of man.

52:37.318 --> 52:39.852
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me. So what happened

52:39.854 --> 52:43.724
here? What happen? What happened
to the first woman? The woman we

52:43.726 --> 52:46.359
just read about in chapter 1?
The one that wasn't made from

52:46.361 --> 52:50.030
Adam's rib? Let's talk about
that for a minute, let's talk

52:50.032 --> 52:55.102
about the theory of
Adam's first wife.

52:55.104 --> 52:57.870
Now there are two texts
in history that talk about her

52:57.872 --> 53:03.910
in great detail. One is Zohar or
the Splendor written in the 13th

53:03.912 --> 53:08.048
century and the other one... the
Alphabet of Ben Sira.

53:08.050 --> 53:10.916
A collection of writings
compiled in the middle ages.

53:10.918 --> 53:13.820
Now, according
to these writings,

53:13.822 --> 53:18.124
Lilith... was
Adam's first wife.

53:18.126 --> 53:22.062
And Adam and Lilith were made
of the same ground the same dust

53:22.064 --> 53:26.066
and time were
separate and equal.

53:26.068 --> 53:29.736
Well guess what Adam didn't want
that, no he wanted his wife to

53:29.738 --> 53:33.810
be subservient.

53:37.845 --> 53:42.816
"Lie beneath me
women as we mate"...

53:42.818 --> 53:44.885
What a guy, huh?

53:44.887 --> 53:50.222
Well Lilith refused, she wanted
to be on top... she wanted

53:50.224 --> 53:54.827
position of power
dominance and authority.

53:54.829 --> 54:00.966
But Adam wasn't up for that.
So, Lilith in anger cursed

54:00.968 --> 54:07.908
the God of creation and fled
paradise. And God in-turn...

54:07.910 --> 54:13.847
cursed her womb and banished her
from the Garden of Eden forever.

54:13.849 --> 54:20.019
Ohhh Lilith, now she's a Godless
demon filled with venomous

54:20.021 --> 54:26.193
hatred and rage toward God. She
turned her fury to the one she

54:26.195 --> 54:35.037
believes caused
her demise... man.

54:49.852 --> 54:56.289
She seeks to destroy him
with his own sexual desires

54:56.291 --> 55:02.465
the very thing that
caused her fate.

55:39.834 --> 55:44.206
She got some
interesting titles out of it.

55:44.506 --> 55:51.111
They called her "The
seducer of the night",

55:51.113 --> 55:59.151
"The blood thirsty demon" "The
succubus" that only preys on

55:59.153 --> 56:08.995
men. Well all this is open for
discussion. The floors yours...

56:08.997 --> 56:15.805
tomorrow. Class dismissed.

56:17.405 --> 56:22.075
Hey I didn't think you would be
here. Bro I didn't sleep a wink

56:22.077 --> 56:26.012
last night man. I mean this
whole vision thing has got me

56:26.014 --> 56:29.416
paranoid I'm like looking over
my shoulders every five seconds.

56:29.418 --> 56:33.019
But like that thing you were
saying about it being real...

56:33.021 --> 56:36.488
Yo, yeah it... it felt real.
It actually happened.

56:36.490 --> 56:40.593
Well was anybody hurt?

56:40.595 --> 56:43.430
Pete?

56:43.432 --> 56:45.164
- Yeah that is her.
- What?

56:45.166 --> 56:45.865
There's that girl.

56:45.867 --> 56:47.334
What girl?

56:47.336 --> 56:51.908
Hey, Pete, Pete, Pete!
Was... was anybody hurt?

56:52.608 --> 56:56.376
Yo yo, ahhh Mike
Mike ahhh excuse me for a

56:56.378 --> 56:59.044
second, I hope you block
better then you talk to girls

56:59.046 --> 57:00.280
Come on man.

57:00.282 --> 57:02.048
Excuse me?

57:02.050 --> 57:05.385
It's me, I found you!

57:05.387 --> 57:07.187
Umm, I don't know you.

57:07.189 --> 57:11.323
Fantasy, right?

57:11.325 --> 57:12.325
Fantasy?

57:12.327 --> 57:14.160
Yeah that's your name.
That's what you told me?

57:14.162 --> 57:17.930
No I'm sorry, I think you have
the wrong girl I'm sorry...

57:17.932 --> 57:19.099
You don't remember me?

57:19.101 --> 57:21.300
I meet a lot of guys so...

57:21.302 --> 57:24.570
No we were talking at Club
Shrine the other night.

57:24.572 --> 57:27.439
I smelled
you from a mile away.

57:27.441 --> 57:35.381
I have been thinking
about you....for a real...

57:35.383 --> 57:41.354
For a real... hey hey!

57:41.356 --> 57:47.263
Listen you scumbag you should've
died with the rest of them!

57:47.461 --> 57:49.062
Peter Johnson?

57:49.064 --> 57:50.430
Hey what's up fellas?

57:50.432 --> 57:52.097
You need to come with us.

57:52.099 --> 57:53.432
For what?

57:53.434 --> 57:57.336
POLICE OFFICER #1 We need to ask
you a few questions, Peter.

57:57.338 --> 58:02.508
I'm sorry.

58:02.510 --> 58:08.715
I saw it happening.

58:08.717 --> 58:12.521
What?

58:13.555 --> 58:23.562
I... I had one of them ahhh, those
vision things again.

58:23.564 --> 58:26.032
Like a premonition
thing and...

58:26.034 --> 58:28.200
Why, why didn't you warn them?

58:28.202 --> 58:31.704
I... I...I mean, I...

58:31.706 --> 58:36.075
I just... it was different
this time because it

58:36.077 --> 58:38.178
it happened before hand and
it's, it's never it's never been

58:38.180 --> 58:39.979
like that...

58:39.981 --> 58:47.956
Where did you come from?
Where did you come from!?

58:56.530 --> 59:00.733
Ay I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doing here man.

59:00.735 --> 59:04.104
So what happen after you left?

59:04.106 --> 59:09.108
I went back to the
apartment, ummm looked over my

59:09.110 --> 59:13.747
play book. Obviously you guys
don't know who I am you know...

59:13.749 --> 59:16.216
I know my arms broken but you
know you guys are going to be

59:16.218 --> 59:18.385
seeing me in the NFL.

59:18.387 --> 59:21.421
Wow, impressive, huh?

59:21.423 --> 59:23.189
But I made some phone calls.

59:23.191 --> 59:25.425
Who did you call?

59:25.427 --> 59:31.765
Man I don't know I don't
remember... Some girls?

59:31.767 --> 59:38.504
Guys, what am I doing
here what is this about?

59:38.506 --> 59:41.173
Huh? Am I in some
kind of trouble?

59:41.175 --> 59:43.209
Man you didn't hear anybody
say that did you?

59:43.211 --> 59:45.577
Listen I'm going to
get straight to the point.

59:45.579 --> 59:47.347
Get to it then...

59:47.349 --> 59:50.350
I got 9 of your friends dead and
you were the last to see them

59:50.352 --> 59:54.387
alive.

59:54.389 --> 59:56.722
You need to start talking.

59:56.724 --> 59:59.325
What, wait a minute,
what are you talking about?

59:59.327 --> 01:00:03.796
Who helped ya?

01:00:03.798 --> 01:00:10.803
What, no no, you
you said dead?

01:00:10.805 --> 01:00:16.111
Go ahead.
It ain't gonna bite you.

01:00:21.082 --> 01:00:24.283
Oh!

01:00:24.285 --> 01:00:27.187
Jason...

01:00:27.189 --> 01:00:32.325
You were there that night. I
need to hear your story Pete.

01:00:32.327 --> 01:00:35.829
Nobody can tell your
story like you can.

01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:37.497
Jason...

01:00:37.499 --> 01:00:41.700
Don't make the mistake of
letting someone else write it.

01:00:41.702 --> 01:00:43.369
This can't be happening.

01:00:43.371 --> 01:00:46.506
Those pictures ain't gonna
change. As a matter of fact they

01:00:46.508 --> 01:00:48.508
might get a little worst though.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.843
We have a big
game this weekend.

01:00:50.845 --> 01:00:53.646
Looks like you're gonna
be playing by yourself.

01:00:53.648 --> 01:00:55.747
Did you drink too much, man?
What happened?

01:00:55.749 --> 01:00:58.450
Hundreds of students are
gathered this evening outside of

01:00:58.452 --> 01:01:02.421
UMT ATLANTA. To mourn the deaths
of members of the university's

01:01:02.423 --> 01:01:06.126
football team who were brutally
murdered last week off campus.

01:01:06.128 --> 01:01:09.361
Authorities are asking for
anyone with information to

01:01:09.363 --> 01:01:13.068
please come forward...

01:01:29.383 --> 01:01:33.820
Hey, there you are...

01:01:33.822 --> 01:01:37.356
Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

01:01:37.358 --> 01:01:41.561
I thought I lost you.

01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:46.231
Can you walk me back to my dorm?

01:01:46.233 --> 01:01:47.566
Huh, huh?

01:01:47.568 --> 01:01:51.474
Can you walk me back to my dorm.

01:01:52.807 --> 01:01:55.807
Yeah. Yeah, yeah...

01:01:55.809 --> 01:01:58.211
Thanks.

01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:22.434
Well you may
not know who I am but I know

01:02:22.436 --> 01:02:24.771
who you are.
My name is Tammy Knight.

01:02:24.773 --> 01:02:25.872
Hi.

01:02:25.874 --> 01:02:30.776
Before I continue you
must tell me how much you know?

01:02:30.778 --> 01:02:33.613
What do you...

01:02:33.615 --> 01:02:36.249
What do you mean what I know?
What does that mean?

01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:43.622
Do you know who your
parents are Jeremiah?

01:02:43.624 --> 01:02:46.561
No.

01:02:52.267 --> 01:02:56.535
My husband was Pastor
Robert J. Knight.

01:02:56.537 --> 01:02:59.805
He built this place
from the ground up...

01:02:59.807 --> 01:03:03.642
Every part of it. But my
husband became very distracted

01:03:03.644 --> 01:03:07.446
with the success of the
ministry. I believe we simply

01:03:07.448 --> 01:03:10.350
got too big too soon.

01:03:10.352 --> 01:03:13.620
Many in this city depended on my
husband's work and dedication to

01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:22.461
God but like the
others he would fail.

01:03:22.463 --> 01:03:26.932
Jeremiah, my husband was
different, chosen among the

01:03:26.934 --> 01:03:31.303
chosen. He possessed
unique gifts. Without a moments

01:03:31.305 --> 01:03:34.941
notice he would have these open
visions, premonitions of danger

01:03:34.943 --> 01:03:37.809
he would then warn others.

01:03:37.811 --> 01:03:41.314
This gift was pass down from
generation to generation.

01:03:41.316 --> 01:03:46.722
From his fathers father
to him, and now...

01:03:49.057 --> 01:03:53.358
Lot in
the Bible was a righteous man.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.662
The only one left in the city
of Sodom and Gomorrah. Evil had

01:03:56.664 --> 01:04:01.968
besieged the city but it could
not fully prosper until all the

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:08.675
bloodline of the
righteous were destroyed.

01:04:08.677 --> 01:04:15.682
My husband Robert
Jeremiah Knight because of his

01:04:15.684 --> 01:04:25.694
bloodline was
that man, your father.

01:04:26.827 --> 01:04:28.831
What are you saying?

01:04:31.032 --> 01:04:34.602
Your father...

01:04:36.338 --> 01:04:39.638
You mean, you mean to
tell me, you expect me to

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.307
believe...

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:43.542
You must. People are dying.

01:04:43.544 --> 01:04:45.812
Forget forget forget the
people!? You mean to tell me

01:04:45.814 --> 01:04:50.619
that the guy you been
telling me about is my dad?

01:04:51.352 --> 01:04:54.856
I'm sorry that you had
to find out this way.

01:05:05.767 --> 01:05:12.571
The same evil I spoke about in
Sodom and Gomorrah is here.

01:05:12.573 --> 01:05:16.943
Here in this city.
It's what killed your father.

01:05:16.945 --> 01:05:21.680
This doesn't make any sense.
Alright if this guy's my father

01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:26.017
then whose whose
whose my mother? Hm?

01:05:26.019 --> 01:05:28.521
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news.

01:05:28.523 --> 01:05:30.655
Your mother Sarah wasn't
well before you were born.

01:05:30.657 --> 01:05:35.363
She suffered from
a serious case of depression.

01:05:37.398 --> 01:05:40.399
Your father, new
to the ministry tried his

01:05:40.401 --> 01:05:44.137
best to help Sarah
overcome her illness.

01:05:44.139 --> 01:05:46.805
Months had past and then
she found out about you.

01:05:46.807 --> 01:05:51.510
She was pregnant.

01:06:10.898 --> 01:06:13.832
What should of been a joyous
occasion turned quickly into

01:06:13.834 --> 01:06:21.073
sadness, anxiously... guilt.
Robert feared that soon your

01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:23.943
mother would be at a breaking
point... but that changed

01:06:23.945 --> 01:06:26.479
briefly once you were born.

01:06:26.481 --> 01:06:32.755
Sarah for once
was happy... but then...

01:06:33.854 --> 01:06:36.455
It would be that phone call that
would haunt your father up until

01:06:36.457 --> 01:06:41.063
the day he died.

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:46.865
Sarah, please honey honey honey
honey honey... please just calm

01:06:46.867 --> 01:06:54.207
down, calm down, I'm almost
done, I'll be, no no... don't...

01:06:54.209 --> 01:06:57.676
Hey! I'm coming home right now
alright I'm coming home right

01:06:57.678 --> 01:07:02.017
now!

01:07:03.718 --> 01:07:05.184
Where she go!?

01:07:05.186 --> 01:07:07.887
She left 10 minutes ago
with the baby I couldn't stop her!

01:07:07.889 --> 01:07:10.825
Ohh shoot!!!

01:07:14.896 --> 01:07:18.064
Saddam Hussein must not
be allowed to threaten his

01:07:18.066 --> 01:07:21.069
neighbors...

01:07:32.247 --> 01:07:38.654
There's no other way.

01:07:40.921 --> 01:07:44.923
I'm so sorry, I'm gonna take
you to a better place....

01:07:44.925 --> 01:07:45.624
I'm so sorry...

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:47.693
Sarah please just calm down...

01:07:47.695 --> 01:07:48.861
I'm sorry Bobby...

01:07:48.863 --> 01:07:53.135
Sarah please honey honey
alright alright please please!

01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:11.283
Alright I'm here aren't I, so
how am I alive... huh!?

01:08:11.285 --> 01:08:15.954
I don't know. That is a
question I can't answer.

01:08:15.956 --> 01:08:19.057
After several years you were
declared dead, your body was

01:08:19.059 --> 01:08:23.962
never found.

01:08:53.126 --> 01:08:59.997
That's crazy, that's
crazy, that's crazy...

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.667
But you're here now and you
can't run away from this

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:04.803
Jeremiah.

01:09:04.805 --> 01:09:07.840
I... I, I, I don't... I don't know
what to believe alright.

01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:12.345
I'm sorry Tammy
but... this is...

01:09:12.346 --> 01:09:17.783
C'mon you feel it. You feel it
deep down inside of you.

01:09:17.785 --> 01:09:23.055
God has chosen you and only
you for this hour. You are the

01:09:23.057 --> 01:09:29.095
last of his bloodline. You will
need to be ready because evil is

01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:30.828
after you.

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:39.575
Can I help you?

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.041
Can I help you?

01:09:42.042 --> 01:09:44.243
You troubled little girl.

01:09:44.245 --> 01:09:48.716
Excuse me?

01:09:49.282 --> 01:09:52.587
My stomach...

01:09:53.687 --> 01:09:58.693
You're in the way.

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:24.753
Oh my, God.
What are you?

01:10:26.853 --> 01:10:31.990
Look what we have here.
It must be Jason's or is it your

01:10:31.992 --> 01:10:34.228
father's?

01:10:35.095 --> 01:10:36.895
Please don't hurt me.

01:10:36.897 --> 01:10:41.233
If you want to ever live to give
birth to this bastard of a child

01:10:41.235 --> 01:10:44.102
you better leave this
city and never return.

01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:48.106
Do you understand!?
Do you understand!?

01:10:48.108 --> 01:10:50.012
Yes yes!
Please God...

01:11:07.929 --> 01:11:10.128
No your not your not listening
to me your not listening to

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:12.898
me... Charlie. Charlie
you're not listening to me!

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.801
Look they they they lied to
me I'm telling you they lied to

01:11:15.803 --> 01:11:18.971
me the agency lied to me!

01:11:18.973 --> 01:11:25.977
No, no, no,
no, look it's like...

01:11:25.979 --> 01:11:30.149
It's like I'm in a maze and and
and I don't know which way to go

01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:32.784
and, and, and, and, and it's
only getting worse...

01:11:32.786 --> 01:11:38.390
Char... Char... Charlie who's
Robert Knight? Who... who... who's...

01:11:38.392 --> 01:11:45.400
who's Sarah Knight?
Who is she, Charlie?

01:11:49.003 --> 01:11:53.038
I plead with you to seek God for
his understanding and trust

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.045
me you shall find it.

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:09.355
You will need to be ready
because evil is after you.

01:12:09.357 --> 01:12:11.990
I want to show you something.
Now our victim was seen at a

01:12:11.992 --> 01:12:14.392
downtown strip club about 6
hours before he reported to

01:12:14.394 --> 01:12:16.895
work. Excuse me.

01:12:16.897 --> 01:12:18.263
Show him what you got.

01:12:18.265 --> 01:12:21.836
This what we have so far.

01:12:22.804 --> 01:12:26.174
There's our victim...

01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:28.608
But who was he with?

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:34.950
Wait for it... Look at the door.

01:12:36.983 --> 01:12:40.388
There you go Reid.
That's who we need to talk to.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:47.161
That there might be
our first real lead.

01:12:48.028 --> 01:12:50.328
Of a problem, which
is one of the conics sections

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:53.968
that we are going to
learn about today.

01:12:58.039 --> 01:12:59.204
Hey.

01:12:59.206 --> 01:13:02.240
Oh, uhm hi hi?

01:13:02.242 --> 01:13:07.448
I'm sorry I, I, I, I was here
for uhh, Sonja, uhm...

01:13:09.183 --> 01:13:10.850
We... we met right?

01:13:10.852 --> 01:13:13.084
Yeah we've crossed paths.

01:13:13.086 --> 01:13:14.587
You, uhh...
you... you just disappeared.

01:13:14.589 --> 01:13:18.923
Yeah that was a tough day for
everyone. All the tribute videos

01:13:18.925 --> 01:13:22.461
to all the players and stuff.
It's heartbreaking.

01:13:22.463 --> 01:13:26.465
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:13:26.467 --> 01:13:27.967
Uhm, I'm, I'm...

01:13:27.969 --> 01:13:29.501
Jeremiah.

01:13:29.503 --> 01:13:32.337
Yeah, you know my name.
How do you know my name?

01:13:32.339 --> 01:13:36.475
My cousin Sonja
told me all about you.

01:13:36.477 --> 01:13:39.878
Oh ok so... you're her cousin?

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.217
Yeah ummm unfortunately,
She has her ways about her if

01:13:45.219 --> 01:13:48.486
you know what I mean.
I love her to pieces though.

01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:51.390
I offered to help her pack.

01:13:51.392 --> 01:13:52.891
What do you mean pack?
What do you mean?

01:13:52.893 --> 01:13:56.628
You know her mom
struggled with uhm...

01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:58.263
- Naw yeah, yeah she...
- Yeah.

01:13:58.265 --> 01:14:00.298
...told me, I know.

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:05.539
I was gonna run to the student
union, you want to walk with me?

01:14:06.406 --> 01:14:08.373
Yeah, yeah.
I could walk with you.

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:12.313
Let me grab my purse. Okay.

01:14:17.084 --> 01:14:21.188
My name's Jessica by the way.

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:27.525
You attract a lot
of attention.

01:14:27.527 --> 01:14:32.431
Tell me about it.
You guys are terrible.

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:35.266
Maybe they'll think you're my
boyfriend and back off.

01:14:35.268 --> 01:14:37.535
No, no, I don't... I don't
know about that.

01:14:37.537 --> 01:14:41.539
What, I'm not your type?

01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:46.345
No no no you... you... no, no, it's
not that you're not my type,

01:14:46.347 --> 01:14:48.713
you're very beautiful and I
don't think that people would

01:14:48.715 --> 01:14:52.217
believe that... that you were my
girlfriend or anything like that.

01:14:52.219 --> 01:14:56.055
Awww that's so sweet.
Don't be like that.

01:14:56.057 --> 01:15:02.160
Listen, we all have a story
looking to find ourselves but

01:15:02.162 --> 01:15:12.173
sometimes we find ourselves in
others. And that's attractive.

01:15:14.075 --> 01:15:22.584
By the way, You are my type.

01:15:26.387 --> 01:15:30.424
I have to go that way.

01:15:37.732 --> 01:15:41.166
We should connect again.
It would be fun.

01:15:41.168 --> 01:15:45.169
Sonja told me about what a great
guy you are. That's what

01:15:45.171 --> 01:15:50.010
really counts.

01:15:50.411 --> 01:15:55.413
Are you serious, Are you kidding
me! Keep on dreaming bro...

01:17:16.696 --> 01:17:21.533
Dahistrom be on standby...

01:17:21.535 --> 01:17:25.837
I think I may have something.

01:17:35.182 --> 01:17:40.755
Yo, so I can't
come in, well forget you then!!!

01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:49.627
Yes I'm Detective McKenzie Reid.

01:17:49.629 --> 01:17:51.629
Stand down.

01:17:51.631 --> 01:17:53.532
Am I in trouble or something?

01:17:53.534 --> 01:17:56.467
Again I'm Detective
McKenzie Reid of Atlanta PD.

01:17:56.469 --> 01:17:58.604
Do you mind if I can have
a moment of your time?

01:17:58.606 --> 01:18:01.539
Ahhh sure come in?

01:18:01.541 --> 01:18:06.146
Thanks, I won't be too long.

01:18:08.549 --> 01:18:12.650
I wasn't expecting company.
I just got off of work.

01:18:12.652 --> 01:18:15.154
I'm a... I'm a dancer.

01:18:15.156 --> 01:18:17.221
Figured as much.

01:18:17.223 --> 01:18:19.224
You mind if I
change really quick?

01:18:19.226 --> 01:18:23.361
No go right ahead.
I'll wait right here.

01:19:38.272 --> 01:19:43.211
Would you like a drink?

01:19:45.845 --> 01:19:55.787
No not while on
duty, but thanks.

01:19:55.789 --> 01:19:58.323
So what can I help
you with officer?

01:19:58.325 --> 01:20:00.795
You mind?

01:20:10.004 --> 01:20:13.271
As I was saying. You may know
there have been multiple

01:20:13.273 --> 01:20:16.874
homicides throughout the city
over the past few months.

01:20:16.876 --> 01:20:22.547
It's so sad and It must be so
stressful. Pulling you away from

01:20:22.549 --> 01:20:28.919
your friends and family
requiring so much attention.

01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:34.359
I bet you do have a
lot of lady friends.

01:20:34.361 --> 01:20:38.329
I appreciate it, but the real
reason I came tonight was to ask

01:20:38.331 --> 01:20:40.332
you about this man...

01:20:40.334 --> 01:20:42.566
Look familiar?

01:20:42.568 --> 01:20:44.903
Not off hand.

01:20:44.905 --> 01:20:48.640
He was seen leaving your place
of employment after a session

01:20:48.642 --> 01:20:51.310
you had with him?

01:20:51.312 --> 01:20:53.744
Uhh... I might of
dealt with him.

01:20:53.746 --> 01:20:58.749
Just take another look. You know
as beautiful as you are I still

01:20:58.751 --> 01:21:03.957
have to press the issue.

01:21:06.727 --> 01:21:10.729
You know... there's something
about your eyes Detective,

01:21:10.731 --> 01:21:15.003
that keeps calling me over.

01:21:16.402 --> 01:21:20.071
You must be so tired of this cat
and mouse game, that you

01:21:20.073 --> 01:21:26.610
sacrifice so much for, friends,
family. You must be suffering

01:21:26.612 --> 01:21:28.747
from a broken heart.

01:21:28.749 --> 01:21:32.016
When was the last time
you been with a woman?

01:21:32.018 --> 01:21:34.886
It's been awhile.

01:21:34.888 --> 01:21:40.025
Your nights must be so
cold and lonely.

01:21:40.027 --> 01:21:41.360
You're so beautiful.

01:21:41.362 --> 01:21:43.965
Yeah...

01:21:44.964 --> 01:21:47.599
We can't do this
we can't do this!

01:21:47.601 --> 01:21:48.667
Why?

01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:50.101
I have to go...

01:21:50.103 --> 01:21:52.104
Just stay a little longer.

01:21:52.106 --> 01:21:53.571
I have to go...

01:21:53.573 --> 01:21:57.644
I know you want me.

01:21:57.911 --> 01:22:01.812
Stay longer, please Detective...

01:22:01.814 --> 01:22:02.646
No...

01:22:02.648 --> 01:22:06.485
Yes,
you wanna stay, you know you do.

01:22:06.487 --> 01:22:13.494
You smell so good...
you're so soft.

01:22:23.804 --> 01:22:26.437
We can't do this we cant do...

01:22:26.439 --> 01:22:30.777
What in God's name!

01:22:45.992 --> 01:22:50.529
Reid, I need your location.
Reid, come in.

01:22:50.531 --> 01:22:54.900
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

01:22:54.902 --> 01:23:00.675
Reid, I need your location.
Reid, Reid, come in.

01:23:06.179 --> 01:23:07.913
Reid, I need your location.

01:23:11.718 --> 01:23:18.025
Back to Hell!

01:23:18.991 --> 01:23:22.026
Hey.

01:23:22.028 --> 01:23:23.994
Hi...

01:23:23.996 --> 01:23:29.868
Uhm... I wanted to go out tonight
but I don't have any friends.

01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:33.637
I find that hard to believe.

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:40.846
You haven't even touched your
drink. Is that not how you like

01:23:40.848 --> 01:23:41.879
it?

01:23:41.881 --> 01:23:48.790
Uhh, no no no, uhm... just...

01:23:49.656 --> 01:23:53.891
I... I got to be honest I don't...
I don't really drink.

01:23:53.893 --> 01:23:55.092
Why?

01:23:55.094 --> 01:23:57.962
I just, I don't know I should
have said something when you

01:23:57.964 --> 01:24:00.164
ordered this for me but, I don't
even know what to do with this

01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:01.699
so I... I don't...

01:24:01.701 --> 01:24:03.133
No you're
making me feel bad.

01:24:03.135 --> 01:24:06.671
No don't feel bad don't feel
bad, I should of said

01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:11.008
something...
I don't really drink.

01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:15.814
Jeremiah, you're really
interesting. Your parents must

01:24:15.816 --> 01:24:21.520
be really proud.

01:24:21.522 --> 01:24:25.623
Should I have not said that,
about your parents?

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:27.691
No no not I mean...
c'mon, like, like you said,

01:24:27.693 --> 01:24:32.263
it's uh... everyone's got
their story you know.

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:37.472
And I would love to know
more about yours.

01:24:40.941 --> 01:24:46.544
I never knew my parents. I spent
most of my life in foster homes

01:24:46.546 --> 01:24:51.949
in group homes, like in Atlanta
Missouri New England all over

01:24:51.951 --> 01:24:52.684
the place.

01:24:52.686 --> 01:24:53.952
I had no clue.

01:24:53.954 --> 01:24:56.988
Yeah, yeah so that's why I don't
really know anybody or have any

01:24:56.990 --> 01:25:00.958
friends or anything like that.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:05.062
I call them temporaries, the
people that worked at the foster

01:25:05.064 --> 01:25:09.034
homes, that's what I called them
because they were like your

01:25:09.036 --> 01:25:14.105
family and they took care of you
and did everything like that

01:25:14.107 --> 01:25:16.608
but as soon as you became to
complicated or to difficult to

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:18.909
understand or anything like that
they make a phone call and send

01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:24.583
you packing like you never even
existed, so that's why I call

01:25:24.585 --> 01:25:28.421
them that.

01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:36.162
My uhh...

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:44.668
I just found out that, my mother
my real mother my biological

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:45.837
mother she...

01:25:45.839 --> 01:25:47.271
Yeah...

01:25:47.273 --> 01:25:51.842
she was, some kind of head case,
I guess. Like not right,

01:25:51.844 --> 01:25:52.776
you know.

01:25:52.778 --> 01:25:55.113
And uhm...

01:25:55.115 --> 01:25:59.016
I found out that my father he
was uh... he was like some

01:25:59.018 --> 01:26:04.888
prominent pastor at some church
in Atlanta or something,

01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:07.124
It's quite the
combination, right?

01:26:07.126 --> 01:26:13.832
Oh. Jesus, are you... are you ok!?
Did... let me... are you ok?

01:26:13.834 --> 01:26:19.106
I'm fine.

01:26:32.318 --> 01:26:40.891
You think you're slick.
You won't with this one.

01:26:40.893 --> 01:26:42.694
I'll show you.

01:26:42.696 --> 01:26:45.696
Is she ok? Looked like
she was bleeding?

01:26:45.698 --> 01:26:48.298
You can take this too. I don't...

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:54.338
Honey, are you ok?

01:27:22.768 --> 01:27:24.435
Are you ok?

01:27:24.437 --> 01:27:25.837
Yeah I'm fine.

01:27:25.839 --> 01:27:27.105
Are you... are you cut?

01:27:27.107 --> 01:27:31.876
No silly it was
just the wine. Look.

01:27:31.878 --> 01:27:39.085
You want to get out of here,
my dress is ruined.

01:27:39.452 --> 01:27:42.923
There was some kind of...
coming out of her hands...

01:27:43.756 --> 01:27:46.891
I like this place more,
it's quiet.

01:27:46.893 --> 01:27:48.793
Relaxing?

01:27:48.795 --> 01:27:51.096
Yeah.

01:27:51.098 --> 01:27:52.163
Jeremiah?

01:27:52.165 --> 01:27:54.998
Yeah.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.901
Are you scared of me?

01:27:57.903 --> 01:27:58.970
No.

01:27:58.972 --> 01:28:02.340
Everytime I try to get
close to you, It's like your

01:28:02.342 --> 01:28:07.011
uncomfortable or something.

01:28:07.013 --> 01:28:11.149
To be honest with you,
I've been having these,

01:28:11.151 --> 01:28:16.020
like... like visions and like
these hallucinations and they

01:28:16.022 --> 01:28:17.254
seem very real

01:28:17.256 --> 01:28:21.793
Whatever it is I hope it doesn't
get in between what we have,

01:28:21.795 --> 01:28:28.369
that would be devastating.

01:28:29.302 --> 01:28:33.070
And those who
trespass against us, Lead us not in to

01:28:33.072 --> 01:28:38.042
temptation BUT DELIVER US FROM
EVIL for thine is the kingdom

01:28:38.044 --> 01:28:42.513
the power and the glory forever
amen...

01:28:42.515 --> 01:28:52.489
We have one of the
best pastors in the whole wide world.

01:28:52.491 --> 01:28:56.261
Jesus said and these
signs shall follow them that

01:28:56.263 --> 01:29:04.438
believe; and in his name
they cast out devils.

01:29:12.278 --> 01:29:17.849
Sister! I had a open vision
about you. I see the enemy

01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:21.886
wanting to kill you. Come here,
come over here, come here

01:29:21.888 --> 01:29:25.222
right now and receive.

01:29:25.224 --> 01:29:29.526
I curse every demon,
every spirit that will ever

01:29:29.528 --> 01:29:34.532
try to harm you, I cast it away
right now in the name of Jesus,

01:29:34.534 --> 01:29:40.974
in the name of Jesus,
in the name of Jesus!

01:29:42.409 --> 01:29:44.042
There is a power in the word.

01:29:44.044 --> 01:29:46.578
That every demon must be
subject. That at the name of

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:51.082
Jesus, every knee shall bow of
things in heaven of things in

01:29:51.084 --> 01:29:52.050
earth.

01:29:52.052 --> 01:29:57.154
You are the last of his
bloodline. God has

01:29:57.156 --> 01:30:01.359
chosen you and
only you for this hour.

01:30:01.361 --> 01:30:04.895
We are deploying
every resource possible to take

01:30:04.897 --> 01:30:07.899
control of this situation.

01:30:07.901 --> 01:30:10.868
I've been in contact
with our Governor and we both

01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:18.275
agreed to deploy the national
guard. I want to say this,

01:30:18.277 --> 01:30:23.882
these victims are more then just
numbers and statistics. They're

01:30:23.884 --> 01:30:31.388
someone's family members,
fathers, friends and neighbors.

01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:37.395
And I want the city to know, you
are not alone, we share in your

01:30:37.397 --> 01:30:39.263
loss.

01:30:39.265 --> 01:30:44.269
We lost one of our best,
Officer Mckenzie Reid.

01:30:44.271 --> 01:30:51.376
A decorated officer to the APD.
We promise to take all necessary

01:30:51.378 --> 01:30:55.279
actions to bringing those
responsible for these heinous

01:30:55.281 --> 01:30:57.315
acts to justice.

01:30:57.317 --> 01:31:01.418
To justice, to justice, heinous
acts to J...

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:05.556
...Jeremiah. Hurry. Hurry.

01:31:05.558 --> 01:31:07.391
Hello,
Mr. Young. I'm Doctor Kacy.

01:31:07.393 --> 01:31:09.427
Your time is near...

01:31:09.429 --> 01:31:11.095
If you're willing to
get some help.

01:31:11.097 --> 01:31:14.032
You don't have any weird habits
or anything like that do you?

01:31:14.034 --> 01:31:16.566
You had some... episode.

01:31:16.568 --> 01:31:17.368
Jason stop!

01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:20.672
Don't say no.
I know what you want!

01:31:20.674 --> 01:31:22.073
- Pete!
- Yo!

01:31:22.075 --> 01:31:27.046
I thought I was crazy.

01:31:28.682 --> 01:31:34.487
Hello? How
do you know me.

01:31:35.054 --> 01:31:36.988
Your time is near.

01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:40.992
I asked God before I crossed
over to allow me to meet you

01:31:40.994 --> 01:31:42.126
but my time is short.

01:31:42.128 --> 01:31:43.994
Who are you?

01:31:43.996 --> 01:31:47.364
Reid.

01:31:47.366 --> 01:31:48.967
This doesn't make any sense.

01:31:48.969 --> 01:31:52.369
I thought you
were dead, I thought you were dead son.

01:31:52.371 --> 01:31:54.305
All these years I never
stop thinking of you.

01:31:54.307 --> 01:31:56.373
Like the others,
he would fail.

01:31:56.375 --> 01:31:59.010
The victim is Pastor
Robert J. Knight.

01:31:59.012 --> 01:32:00.444
Who are you who are you!?

01:32:00.446 --> 01:32:01.645
Your father.

01:32:01.647 --> 01:32:05.449
You have to listen to me right
now. I failed at my mission.

01:32:05.451 --> 01:32:06.485
I was blinded.

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:11.221
This demon is powerful
It wants total domination.

01:32:11.223 --> 01:32:15.659
She's already begun building a
nest to create an offspring of

01:32:15.661 --> 01:32:17.528
her own.

01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:22.132
Jeremiah her eggs will hatch.
It will be the beginning of the

01:32:22.134 --> 01:32:28.439
apocalypse and God would be
force to destroy mankind.

01:32:28.441 --> 01:32:30.475
Wait wait wait tell me what to
do tell me what to do?

01:32:30.477 --> 01:32:33.011
I need more time, more time!!!

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.087
They are evacuating the campus.
We have to clear this area as

01:32:43.089 --> 01:32:43.855
soon as possible.

01:32:43.857 --> 01:32:44.922
Why what happened?
What happened?

01:32:44.924 --> 01:32:45.989
They found a police
officer's body not to far away

01:32:45.991 --> 01:32:48.191
The school is shutting down
until further notice.

01:32:48.193 --> 01:32:49.526
Wha... Uhh was he a man?

01:32:49.528 --> 01:32:50.328
Wha... what?

01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:51.762
The cop the cop, was
the cop a man?

01:32:51.764 --> 01:32:54.065
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:07.312 --> 01:33:11.114
Jessica. Jessica.

01:33:11.116 --> 01:33:15.453
Jessica?

01:33:15.455 --> 01:33:21.525
Hey... hey are you ok?

01:33:21.527 --> 01:33:23.794
I'm so sorry.

01:33:23.796 --> 01:33:25.797
Well what do you mean what are
you sorry for, what's wrong with

01:33:25.799 --> 01:33:27.032
you?

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:29.734
I just don't want you to think
I'm a bad person, I want to come

01:33:29.736 --> 01:33:37.809
clean, I'm a dancer, okay?
A stripper.

01:33:37.811 --> 01:33:41.479
It's ok why would
you lie about that?

01:33:41.481 --> 01:33:43.847
I just don't want
you to lose you.

01:33:43.849 --> 01:33:49.319
I care about you so much.
I finally found someone who

01:33:49.321 --> 01:33:54.792
likes me for me.

01:33:54.794 --> 01:34:01.399
No ones perfect alright. It's ok
but we need to go right now ok

01:34:01.401 --> 01:34:05.502
because they found another body
and its a cop this time you

01:34:05.504 --> 01:34:06.570
know...

01:34:06.572 --> 01:34:11.742
Oh my God. This messes
everything up. I had something

01:34:11.744 --> 01:34:16.547
special planned for you tonight.
I just, I want to show you how

01:34:16.549 --> 01:34:21.354
much I care.

01:34:25.825 --> 01:34:33.666
Please don't judge me, Jeremiah.
This is only for you.

01:34:34.299 --> 01:34:37.270
Take a seat.

01:34:44.309 --> 01:34:48.147
Just relax ok.

01:34:48.714 --> 01:34:55.153
Enjoy. I'll be right back.

01:36:22.375 --> 01:36:24.775
Do you like what you see?

01:36:24.777 --> 01:36:25.943
Yes.

01:36:25.945 --> 01:36:31.615
I did all this for you. It seems
like someone is enjoying

01:36:31.617 --> 01:36:33.516
themselves.

01:36:33.518 --> 01:36:37.488
What is it about me that makes
you like me so much.

01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:47.501
I like you so much. We were
meant for each other.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:56.808
Please don't resist.
Don't you want me?

01:37:00.679 --> 01:37:04.418
You taste so good...

01:37:09.554 --> 01:37:14.794
I'm so glad I found you.

01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:22.766
Wait wait wait, wait wait I
can't I cant I can't...

01:37:22.768 --> 01:37:23.568
Jeremiah?

01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:25.302
Something...
something's not right.

01:37:25.304 --> 01:37:26.636
Just lose yourself...

01:37:26.638 --> 01:37:30.007
No no no it's it's
it's happening...

01:37:30.009 --> 01:37:30.708
Jeremiah!

01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:32.310
- We just need to...
- No!

01:37:32.312 --> 01:37:33.644
Slow down...

01:37:33.646 --> 01:37:34.878
I thought you wanted me?

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.949
I do just, we just need
to... just, just wait.

01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:46.793
You promised. You would never
let anything come between us.

01:38:02.075 --> 01:38:07.410
That's it... that's it, Jeremiah.

01:38:07.412 --> 01:38:11.716
Do you believe in God, Jeremiah?
Because he sent you.

01:38:11.718 --> 01:38:14.851
I... I don't know
what to believe...

01:38:14.853 --> 01:38:17.355
You can't run away
from this Jeremiah.

01:38:17.357 --> 01:38:20.123
Everytime I try to get close to
you its like your uncomfortable

01:38:20.125 --> 01:38:22.525
or something.

01:38:22.527 --> 01:38:23.927
I saw it happen...

01:38:23.929 --> 01:38:27.631
Why didn't you warn them...
I, I...

01:38:27.633 --> 01:38:37.443
Almost there
Jeremiah, that's it, you got it.

01:38:38.777 --> 01:38:43.883
Yes, yes...

01:38:47.887 --> 01:38:51.521
There is a great
evil that's present in our city.

01:38:51.523 --> 01:38:58.529
Yes, yes, yes, yes yes...

01:38:58.531 --> 01:38:59.763
I failed at my mission...

01:38:59.765 --> 01:39:02.600
Without a moments notice he
would have these premonitions of

01:39:02.602 --> 01:39:03.834
danger.

01:39:03.836 --> 01:39:05.668
I had to see Jeremiah because I
don't think that he's crazy.

01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:06.503
You were, you
were dead...

01:39:06.505 --> 01:39:07.372
I was blinded...

01:39:07.374 --> 01:39:10.708
The succubus that only
preys on men...

01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:15.649
Your mine Jeremiah!

01:39:38.704 --> 01:39:41.971
Charlie?

01:39:41.973 --> 01:39:43.106
How did you get here?

01:39:43.108 --> 01:39:46.177
And what is that... what're
you... are you... are you...

01:39:46.179 --> 01:39:48.779
what is... are you bleeding?

01:39:48.781 --> 01:39:53.083
Fear not Jeremiah, I'm
your guardian angel.

01:39:53.085 --> 01:39:58.955
I'm the one who pulled you from
the river and hid you until now.

01:39:58.957 --> 01:40:01.992
I was assigned to you to
make sure you fulfill your

01:40:01.994 --> 01:40:04.861
mission.

01:40:04.863 --> 01:40:08.865
This... this is too much, this is
too much, this is...

01:40:08.867 --> 01:40:09.801
this is crazy...

01:40:09.803 --> 01:40:11.901
Well I know it's hard
for you to process.

01:40:11.903 --> 01:40:15.239
She's not even a human. She's
like a monster or something she

01:40:15.241 --> 01:40:17.173
was trying to kill me. Charlie
did you see that is this

01:40:17.175 --> 01:40:18.374
happening?

01:40:18.376 --> 01:40:22.846
It's... it's Lilith. She's after
you and she wants to destroy

01:40:22.848 --> 01:40:24.815
you.

01:40:24.817 --> 01:40:27.685
I don't... I don't want anything
to do with this I never wanted

01:40:27.687 --> 01:40:30.753
this. The only thing close to a
girlfriend I ever had and now

01:40:30.755 --> 01:40:33.224
she trying to like kill me
she's like a monster.

01:40:33.226 --> 01:40:35.525
You have to tell her that I
don't wanna die I don't want

01:40:35.527 --> 01:40:36.761
anything to do with this.

01:40:36.763 --> 01:40:42.967
It doesn't work like that. It's
who you are and what you will

01:40:42.969 --> 01:40:49.138
become that Lilith fears.

01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:55.279
Okay. I didn't, I didn't do
it with her so, so she can't

01:40:55.281 --> 01:40:57.580
kill me right?

01:40:57.582 --> 01:41:01.718
I, I don't know...

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:08.928
But she is very very angry.

01:41:10.263 --> 01:41:15.099
Wait wait wait, wait wait wait
Charlie no no no, don't don't

01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:21.875
don't... Charlie!!!

01:41:37.756 --> 01:41:40.791
This is unit 167 we got a hit on
the serial killer we need back up.

01:41:40.793 --> 01:41:44.595
What is your location?

01:41:44.597 --> 01:41:46.797
Our murderer is inside

01:41:46.799 --> 01:41:48.099
Let's go! let's go!

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:50.333
All units in the
downtown core please respond...

01:41:50.335 --> 01:41:55.608
All cars back,
Lieutenant Dahistrom, sector 7!

01:42:00.979 --> 01:42:04.617
No, no...

01:42:06.686 --> 01:42:11.558
Jeremiah!

01:42:11.991 --> 01:42:22.002
Behold, I give unto you power to
tread over the enemy.

01:42:25.338 --> 01:42:27.870
There is a power in the word
that every demon must be

01:42:27.872 --> 01:42:32.242
subject, that at the name of
Jesus, every knee shall bow of

01:42:32.244 --> 01:42:34.611
things in heaven
of things in earth.

01:42:34.613 --> 01:42:40.083
Come on you feel it, you feel it
deep down inside you, God has

01:42:40.085 --> 01:42:46.191
chosen you
and only you for this hour.

01:42:50.196 --> 01:42:55.164
Everybody hold your fire
until I give a signal.

01:42:55.166 --> 01:42:57.635
These signs follow
those who believe!

01:42:57.637 --> 01:43:02.071
Stop!

01:43:02.073 --> 01:43:08.212
Every demon must be subject that
at the name of the crucified

01:43:08.214 --> 01:43:10.114
one.

01:43:10.116 --> 01:43:18.855
Every knee shall bow, of things
in heaven and things in earth.

01:43:18.857 --> 01:43:26.065
I cast you away from here
in the name of JESUS!

01:43:27.967 --> 01:43:32.638
What in God's name... Drop it!

01:43:38.076 --> 01:43:40.410
I wonder what
the urgency is all about.

01:43:40.412 --> 01:43:45.882
Well let's see.
We got a Jane Doe.

01:43:45.884 --> 01:43:51.087
5'4 125 pounds brought in by
homeland security.

01:43:51.089 --> 01:43:53.123
Homeland security?

01:43:53.125 --> 01:43:58.227
Yeah, everything
else listed on here is classified.

01:43:58.229 --> 01:44:01.731
Whatever, let's get this
done so we can go to lunch.

01:44:01.733 --> 01:44:06.235
Alrighty sounds good,
how bout sushi today?

01:44:06.237 --> 01:44:09.105
So we almost come to the
conclusion on the chapter on

01:44:09.107 --> 01:44:15.111
Lilith, the succubus that hunts
men for her revenge toward God.

01:44:15.113 --> 01:44:19.115
But I got to tell you I think
we're missing something.

01:44:19.117 --> 01:44:22.720
What about women?
Do women have a so

01:44:22.722 --> 01:44:27.257
called demon that wants to
destroy their species?

01:44:27.259 --> 01:44:29.325
You do anything fun last night?

01:44:29.327 --> 01:44:30.927
No, just the usual.

01:44:30.929 --> 01:44:32.930
As always...

01:44:32.932 --> 01:44:35.733
Well let's take a
look at our beauty queen.

01:44:35.735 --> 01:44:40.937
The answer is yes. Because just
like every other coin in life

01:44:40.939 --> 01:44:46.776
ladies and gentleman this one
to has more then one side.

01:44:46.778 --> 01:44:51.981
Scholars believed that when the
succubus has to escape danger

01:44:51.983 --> 01:44:58.254
she turns herself into her male
counter part. The one that comes

01:44:58.256 --> 01:45:03.894
in the shadow of darkness, the
nightmare that lies upon you

01:45:03.896 --> 01:45:07.498
when you sleep.

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:11.871
What?

01:45:19.277 --> 01:45:22.448
The
incubus.

01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:27.450
