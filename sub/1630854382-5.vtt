00:00.739 --> 00:06.180
[Adult Adam] Back in the '80s,
audiences loved the John Candy
movieUncle Buck,

00:06.354 --> 00:09.139
about a ne'er-do-well uncle
called upon to watch
his brother's kids.

00:09.313 --> 00:11.576
But nobody loved it more
than me and my brother Barry.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.665
He washed clothes
in the microwave

00:13.839 --> 00:15.841
and dried them
on the ceiling fan!

00:16.016 --> 00:17.887
He's a menace,
and you root for him!

00:18.061 --> 00:20.194
His garbage car
is spewing smoke
on the school carpool!

00:20.368 --> 00:22.326
The children are coughing!
They're in harm's way!

00:22.500 --> 00:24.372
Turn that crap off.

00:24.546 --> 00:27.070
My pregnant brain hates
that blathering idiot.

00:27.244 --> 00:30.291
She'd be much obliged
if you'd kindly watch
your film elsewhere.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.510
I'm her awfulness-to-politeness
translator. It's been
a full-time job lately.

00:32.684 --> 00:33.772
[Erica] Mom!

00:33.946 --> 00:35.426
What do you need,
Schmoopy-Doo?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.341
Let mama bird cater
to her life-giving

00:37.515 --> 00:39.430
-baby bird's every need.
-I'm here, too.

00:39.604 --> 00:40.736
You know, for when
my wife needs catering.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.564
How ya feeling, Pumpkin?

00:42.738 --> 00:44.566
Ready to pop that baby
into my waiting arms?

00:44.740 --> 00:47.090
That sounds nothing like
our four-page birth plan.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.571
Right now all I want
is for someone
to turn off this dumbness.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.007
How dare you ask us
to turn off

00:51.181 --> 00:52.835
John Candy's
number-one comedy film

00:53.009 --> 00:54.706
in the subcategory
"Babysitting"!

00:54.880 --> 00:57.318
Oh, I love him
in that one movie
with the guy.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.450
You know, um, eh,
the one with the face.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.714
Uh, Adam knows
what I like.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.542
-[sighs] Stripes. -That's the one!

01:04.716 --> 01:07.328
Oh, he is
comedically unhealthy

01:07.502 --> 01:08.894
and shouldn't defend
this country.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.983
He's not just hilarious.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.594
He's also teaching us
how to be uncles.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.987
The only thing that clumsy oaf
is teaching anyone

01:15.162 --> 01:17.207
is to never leave your kids
alone for a minute.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.730
Why is he feeding beer
to a dog?

01:18.904 --> 01:20.080
'Cause he's recklessly
hilarious!

01:20.254 --> 01:21.864
No one is safe
from his antics.

01:22.038 --> 01:23.474
Do you dopes
really think

01:23.648 --> 01:25.215
this is an okay way
for uncles to behave?

01:25.389 --> 01:26.651
-With all my heart.-I'd stake your
unborn child on it.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.653
Okay, well,
that seals it.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.612
You two will neverbe allowed
anywhere near our baby.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.875
-Whoa!
-Whoa, indeed!

01:33.049 --> 01:35.834
How do you expect us to
"Uncle Buck" a baby from afar?

01:36.008 --> 01:37.575
I don't want my baby
to be "Uncle Bucked."

01:37.749 --> 01:40.839
Cheggit.
He made a pancake so huge,

01:41.013 --> 01:42.493
he's serving it
with a shovel.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.843
Breakfast has never been
more zany!

01:45.017 --> 01:47.411
Well, that's actually
the only appealing thing
about this whole movie.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.021
Geoff,
make me that pancake.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.285
Uh, I wish I could,
my cranky angel,

01:51.459 --> 01:53.461
but I don't think anyone's ever
made a pancake that large.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.115
[in singsong voice]
Get it while it's hot!

01:55.289 --> 01:57.073
-Didn't even see her leave.
-What in the hell?

01:57.247 --> 01:58.422
She literally bends time!

01:58.596 --> 02:00.381
You're the best, Mama.

02:00.555 --> 02:01.991
Thank God someone sees
to my wants and needs.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.645
Hurtful to the man
who was up all night

02:03.819 --> 02:05.473
scratching
your unreachables.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.214
I want some of that impossibly
large morning entree.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.216
Me too!
Giant flapjack me!

02:09.390 --> 02:10.608
Mama! Geoff!
Circle the wagons!

02:10.782 --> 02:12.175
Protect my cake!

02:12.349 --> 02:14.177
Unh! Ow! Ow!

02:14.351 --> 02:16.005
♪♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪♪

02:16.179 --> 02:18.355
♪♪ But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say ♪♪

02:21.793 --> 02:23.534
♪♪ I don't know the future ♪♪

02:23.708 --> 02:27.059
♪♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪♪

02:27.234 --> 02:29.540
[Adult Adam]
It was October 19th,
1980-something,

02:29.714 --> 02:32.804
and life for our family
was about to change forever.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.502
-It's time!
Go! Go! Go!
-Gah!

02:34.676 --> 02:36.547
It's 3:00 a.m.!
What the hell?

02:36.721 --> 02:38.158
Your water broke!
You're having a baby!

02:38.332 --> 02:39.463
I should put on pants!

02:39.637 --> 02:40.812
There's no time.
Is that a nightgown?!

02:40.986 --> 02:41.857
It's a floor-length
sleep shirt!

02:42.031 --> 02:43.119
I have sleepy-time
heat issues!

02:43.293 --> 02:44.642
Get your sweats,
your comfy shoes,

02:44.816 --> 02:46.905
take this framed photo of me
for bedside inspiration.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.690
Go! Go! Go! Go!

02:48.864 --> 02:50.039
Wait. How did you know
my water broke?

02:50.213 --> 02:52.650
Uh, I heard it
from my bedroom.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.913
It was like a rolling,
gushing sound

02:55.087 --> 02:57.786
like, uh-- like the waves
on the North Shore of Hawaii.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.744
Okay, I'll never know the
mysteries of the female body,

02:59.918 --> 03:01.833
but wouldn't Erica be aware
of her water breaking?

03:02.007 --> 03:04.662
Enough chit-chat! We're wasting
valuable seconds, people!

03:04.836 --> 03:07.012
Is this another one
of your stupid drills?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.797
Fine. It isa drill,
and you both failed miserably.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.668
Had this been the real thing,

03:10.842 --> 03:12.061
we wouldn't have even made it
to the hospital.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.541
I'd be yanking a baby
out of my daughter

03:13.715 --> 03:14.977
on the front lawn
of the Kremps' house.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.153
What a haunting
suburban tableau.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.590
Mom, enough
with the drills.

03:19.764 --> 03:20.504
Well, it's important
to be prepared.

03:20.678 --> 03:21.940
Hopefully you'll do better
next time.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.594
Don't let there be
a next time!

03:23.768 --> 03:25.466
You're right. No more drills.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.467
[chuckles]

03:26.641 --> 03:27.772
So don't expect one.

03:29.948 --> 03:30.558
-[door closes]-I can't go back to sleep.

03:30.732 --> 03:31.689
My heart is still pounding.

03:31.863 --> 03:32.690
You know
what I want, Geoff?

03:32.864 --> 03:34.301
What, Schmoo?

03:34.475 --> 03:35.476
-I said "Geoff"!
-She said "Geoff"!

03:35.650 --> 03:38.305
Sorry!
I thought you said "Bev"!

03:38.479 --> 03:40.176
Okay, just let me know
if you need me, all right?

03:40.350 --> 03:41.830
I mean, of course,
you need me,

03:42.004 --> 03:44.224
but I am talking about, you
know, in the immediate sense.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.791
Just checking in
on needing me.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.881
Huh? No? Okay. Here I go.

03:53.320 --> 03:57.193
Okay. Well, what I want is to
get my giant body in water.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.629
Okay.
So should I run a bath?

03:58.803 --> 03:59.804
You mean the one
that we share with Barry

03:59.978 --> 04:01.850
and all of his body hair?

04:02.024 --> 04:04.505
So, like, the pool
at the Jewish Community Center?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.985
I don't want to swim
where a rabbi's wife
teaches water aerobics.

04:07.159 --> 04:10.075
I want a babymoon.
We still have three weeks.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.121
Take me away somewhere
I can float
and feel weightless.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.905
Your wish is my command.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.646
Although it may be hard
to find a place

04:15.820 --> 04:17.779
to float in Philadelphia
in the fall,

04:17.953 --> 04:19.955
so is there by chance
a backup wish/command?

04:20.129 --> 04:21.086
Just make it happen.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.479
On it, my surly dove.

04:22.653 --> 04:25.221
Whatever you do,
promise me that...

04:25.395 --> 04:28.137
[softly] she is
nowhere near us.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.226
Well, it is famously not easy
to get away from your mom.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.314
Mom what? I heard "Mom."

04:31.488 --> 04:32.359
-Gah!
-Go!

04:32.533 --> 04:34.317
Fun mistake. Okay.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.276
I'll just wait
right outside this door

04:36.450 --> 04:37.494
for the inevitable
calling of my name.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.887
[chuckles]

04:41.585 --> 04:43.674
[Adult Adam]
As Erica desperately
wanted to dodge my mom,

04:43.848 --> 04:45.023
Barry and I went
straight to his friends

04:45.197 --> 04:46.547
for some uncle-ing advice.

04:46.721 --> 04:49.027
JTP but not lame Adam.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.203
[all]
JTP but not lame Adam.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.770
Hard to not feel
deeply wounded,
but nice to see you, fellas.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.424
No pleasantries!

04:54.598 --> 04:57.688
-The JTP's time
is too valuable.
-Not really.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.299
You called me away from a mixer
with upper management.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.431
Because it is important,
Matthew.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.173
Our sister said we would be
"garbage uncles"

05:04.347 --> 05:05.827
and we won't be allowed
near her baby.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.829
We have three weeks
to figure out

05:08.003 --> 05:09.352
how not to suck
at uncle-ing.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.049
-Why us?
-It seems intuitive.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.399
For this,
I basically handed

05:12.573 --> 05:14.270
the Head of Regional Sales job
over to Lydia?

05:14.444 --> 05:15.663
Well, you're here now,

05:15.837 --> 05:17.186
so let's start with,
"What is an uncle?"

05:17.360 --> 05:18.230
-The husband of an aunt.
-Mother's brother.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.971
A cousin's male parent.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.886
-Your half-sister's stepdad.
-A father's brother.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.279
Your dad's friend
who doesn't have his own kids.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.194
And famous uncles?

05:25.368 --> 05:27.805
Uncle Vanya,
the titular character
from the Chekhov play.

05:27.979 --> 05:28.937
Only word I heard
is "titular."

05:29.111 --> 05:30.330
[chuckles] Next.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.157
Scrooge McDuck. Hah!

05:32.332 --> 05:33.811
All that money,
and he couldn't fine peace.

05:33.985 --> 05:36.379
A personal hero.
But I hate feathers. Next!

05:36.553 --> 05:38.338
Uncle! Like
when you tap out

05:38.512 --> 05:39.687
and stop trying to
think of famous uncles.

05:39.861 --> 05:43.168
Wow! All truly
terrible examples.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.909
You're no longer leading
this crucial meeting, Adam.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.824
I wasn't sure why we were here
until now, so that's fine.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.610
JTP, tell us how to
become good uncles.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.568
My Uncle Phil calls me
cool nicknames

05:51.742 --> 05:54.832
like "Sport," "Champ,"
and "Superstar."

05:55.006 --> 05:56.747
It's possible
he doesn't know my name.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.140
My uncle let me
drive his car.
Oh, that's fun.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.576
Like, when you were 15
or something?

05:59.750 --> 06:01.143
No. No. Recently.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.666
Uh, I think his license
is suspended

06:02.840 --> 06:04.364
and I just
taxied him around.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.496
Keep it coming, guys.
There are no bad ideas.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.934
I know. Why don't we go
to the park, right?

06:10.108 --> 06:13.634
And use candy to lure children
into Matt Bradley's van

06:13.808 --> 06:15.853
so we can practice
uncle-ing on them?

06:16.027 --> 06:19.248
When I said "no bad ideas,"
clearly I was off by one.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.728
What if you practice
on Andy?

06:20.902 --> 06:21.685
He's the side
of an average baby.

06:21.859 --> 06:22.991
[groans]
Come on, man.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.949
Maybe you guys
are overthinking this.

06:25.123 --> 06:27.212
My brain's pretty jacked, so
that happens a lot. Continue.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
Erica is going to be an anxious
mother with a newborn.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.129
She might just want you
to be responsible adults

06:31.303 --> 06:32.609
who are always there for her.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.916
Matt Bradley,
please stop punishing us

06:35.090 --> 06:36.787
with your nonsense.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.441
Look, don't you guys
have an uncle?

06:38.615 --> 06:40.791
We do, and he's
a real piece of work.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.750
[Adult Adam]
I was talking about
our Uncle Marvin.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.056
He was just as much of
an unpredictable loose cannon

06:45.230 --> 06:46.362
as Uncle Buck.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.885
-[both chuckle]
-He's the worst.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.234
Can't do anything right.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.671
There's your answer.
Why don't you just do

06:50.845 --> 06:52.063
the opposite of what
your uncle would do?

06:52.237 --> 06:53.500
I guess
that could maybe work.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.545
[Adult Adam]
And so we sort of had a plan.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.373
Which was to learn
at the feet of the master

06:57.547 --> 06:59.288
hownot to be an uncle.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.899
Hey!
My nephs came to visit!

07:02.073 --> 07:04.032
Wait a minute.
How did you find me?

07:04.206 --> 07:05.512
Your address was on the
"if any left over" section

07:05.686 --> 07:06.948
of our mom's
holiday-card list.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.733
Aww.
Well, that's not nothing.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.213
Is that the truck
from "The Fall Guy"

07:11.387 --> 07:13.041
in your
depressing carport?

07:13.215 --> 07:15.739
Yeah, it's the official
show-sanctioned replica.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.655
No way. That truck
is TV-vehicle royalty.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.788
Big-time,
and now it's mine,

07:20.962 --> 07:22.790
pending payment of
outstanding DMV fees.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.488
Enter.
My house is your house.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.969
But it also
might not be my house.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.710
The stupid city doesn't
consider it a legal dwelling.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.714
Man!
Am I glad to see you boys.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.064
You know, ever since
your dad left us,

07:36.238 --> 07:38.066
I've been trying
to think of ways

07:38.240 --> 07:39.328
that I could be more involved
in your lives.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.156
What about ever
visiting or calling?

07:41.330 --> 07:43.375
Ohh!
Monday morning quarterback.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.681
Look who's got
all the answers now.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.117
Here's the thing.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.989
Erica's baby is due
in three weeks,

07:48.163 --> 07:49.817
and we need to learn
how to be good uncles.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.123
Oh, my God.
I am beyond touched.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.211
You want the Uncle Marvin
playbook.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.561
Sure.
Let's say it that way.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.302
Celebratory sodas
all around!

07:57.477 --> 07:58.869
[Adult Adam]
While we had come
to the right place,

07:59.043 --> 08:01.002
the same couldn't be said
for Geoff and Erica.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.091
Here we are,
my swollen princess.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.875
It's so steamy and damp.
Where are we?

08:05.049 --> 08:06.790
You're at Tubs of Love,

08:06.964 --> 08:09.314
where consenting adults come
to do whatever they want.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.012
[clicks tongue]Why did he wink?

08:11.186 --> 08:12.796
Geoff, I need
so many answers.

08:12.970 --> 08:13.710
Well, you said you wanted
to float in water

08:13.884 --> 08:15.146
without your mother.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.148
So I made both those wishes
come true.

08:17.322 --> 08:18.585
Good sir,
where do we change?

08:18.759 --> 08:20.412
Changing rooms
are back there,

08:20.587 --> 08:22.632
but just so you know, we are
a clothing-optional resort.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.591
Resort? All I see are a bunch
of skanky hot tubs

08:24.765 --> 08:26.593
with couples in them.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.725
No, that guy's there
by himself.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.292
Correction-- his tub-mate
just surfaced.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.250
And so few people
opted for clothing.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.296
Geoff, how did you find
this place?

08:34.470 --> 08:37.299
In the Yellow Pages,
under "Indoor Water-Themed
Adult Experiences."

08:37.473 --> 08:40.476
Our rate is 20 bucks an hour
or 30 for a themed tub like

08:40.650 --> 08:42.609
"Desert Oasis"
or "When in Rome."

08:42.783 --> 08:45.220
Ooh! "When in Rome"
sounds fun. Shall we?

08:45.394 --> 08:46.743
Ew. No, we shan't.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.224
Geoff, pregnant ladies
can't even go in hot tubs.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.313
This was a giant
swing and a miss.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.097
Oh, dear Lord, there are
threepeople in that tub.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.099
Yeah, they fit up to eight
open-minded
and slippery bodies.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.840
I'm gonna make something
very clear.

08:57.014 --> 08:59.582
I want to go home,
never come back here,

08:59.756 --> 09:01.062
and somehow surgically remove
the part of my brain

09:01.236 --> 09:03.325
where the memory
of this place is stored.

09:03.499 --> 09:04.848
Thank you for your hospitality.
We'll be leaving now.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.502
-Tell your friends!
-Seems unlikely.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.505
Ohh...no.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.289
What is it, my grumpy peach?
Are you hungry?

09:11.463 --> 09:13.161
-I think
my water just broke.
-Are you sure?

09:13.335 --> 09:14.771
I mean, the floor
is already covered in--

09:14.945 --> 09:16.033
I don't really want
to know.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.558
Yes, I'm sure, Geoff!
It's happening!

09:18.732 --> 09:19.820
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

09:19.994 --> 09:20.647
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

09:22.300 --> 09:25.913
[Adult Adam]
It was happening. My sister
was going to have a baby,

09:26.087 --> 09:28.437
just nowhere near the hospital
where she and Geoff
had planned.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.700
Okay. The doctor's
on his way in.

09:30.874 --> 09:31.962
Oh, we don't need
the doctor.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.311
We just need to get
to our own hospital.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.357
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
[chuckles]

09:37.228 --> 09:40.275
Dudes! We're having a baby!
Up top!

09:40.449 --> 09:42.146
Left a bro hangin'.
Not cool.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.106
Um, why is the doctor wearing
Air Jordans and a Swatch?

09:45.280 --> 09:48.109
Did our baby
somehow sneak out of me
and throw a lab coat on?

09:48.283 --> 09:50.546
Good one! I'm Dr. Schiff,
but everyone calls me Scotty.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.200
Or Schiffy. Or Scoot.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.897
Or the occasional
Dr. Butthead.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.638
Yeah, I can see that
for you.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.248
Sorry.
You just look very--

09:57.422 --> 09:58.989
Young?
Yeah, I get that a lot.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.296
But rest assured--
I'm a professional.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.473
Okay.
Let's have a looky.

10:04.647 --> 10:08.477
Whoa!
You are wicked dilating.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.045
-Scooty Scoot, could you
give us a minute?
-Totally.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.743
I'll just go crush
a quick round of "Centipede"
in the break room.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.440
I cannot have Doogie Howser's
younger brother

10:15.615 --> 10:16.833
-deliver our baby!
-Okay, I'll go find
another doctor

10:17.007 --> 10:18.139
who might be more
unlike a child.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.575
And also
I need my mom.

10:19.749 --> 10:20.881
Ooh, here's the thing
about that.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.491
Why is there a thing
about that?

10:22.665 --> 10:24.232
Remember when you told me
to plan this babymoon

10:24.406 --> 10:25.973
and you didn't want her
to be a part of it?

10:26.147 --> 10:27.801
I did something to ensure
that she wouldn't be around.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.933
Oh, Geoff, so help me,
if you killed my mom--

10:30.107 --> 10:32.936
No, but I may have indicated
that we were going
to the beach house.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.895
You sent her an hour
in the other direction?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.810
Possibly.
And also yes.

10:36.984 --> 10:40.117
-Get her here! Now!
On it,
-my demanding flower.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.946
[Adult Adam]
Geoff's mission was clear--
get my mom to the hospital,

10:43.120 --> 10:44.382
-no matter
how far away she was.
-[phone rings, beeps]

10:44.556 --> 10:45.906
-Hello, Geoffrey.
-How'd you know it was me?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.385
Who else knows I'm here?

10:47.559 --> 10:49.387
Listen.
Mrs. G, I can explain.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.825
No need to explain.
You didn't want me
crashing your babymoon,

10:51.999 --> 10:53.478
so you told me it was here
at the beach house.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.132
I'm so sorry,
but in my defense,

10:55.306 --> 10:56.568
doesn't the fact
that you went there

10:56.743 --> 10:57.918
to crash our babymoon
vindicate me?

10:58.092 --> 10:59.876
The [bleep] it does,
Geoffrey!

11:00.050 --> 11:03.140
My daughter is about to
give life in three weeks.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.446
I want to be with her.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.883
About that.
Um, Erica's in labor!

11:07.057 --> 11:08.406
What?
I know. Yay.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.191
Also, we're in the one-doctor
town of New Hope.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.454
Well, that's two
[bleep] hours from here!

11:12.628 --> 11:14.195
Again with
the salty language.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.892
But if you leave now,
maybe you can make it.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.851
She's crossing her legs,
so you never know.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.157
That's a great idea, but,
uh, when I first got here,

11:20.331 --> 11:22.203
I was so hurt
by what you'd done to me

11:22.377 --> 11:24.248
that I drank an entire bottle
of Chablis

11:24.422 --> 11:27.338
that my neighbor had carelessly
left in her garage fridge.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.776
-Oh, no!
-You drove me
to the bottle, Geoff!

11:29.950 --> 11:31.952
Okay. I'll send Barry and Adam
to pick you up. Just sit tight.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.737
To be clear,
when I finally do see you,

11:34.911 --> 11:36.434
you and I have some
very unfinished business.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.915
That's the scariest
kind of business!

11:39.089 --> 11:40.743
[Adult Adam]
As my mom was gonna
teach Geoff a lesson,

11:40.917 --> 11:43.224
Opposite Uncle School
was in session.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.269
Compadres, I am
going to teach you

11:45.443 --> 11:48.142
how to be the greatest
uncles in...the...world.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.970
Are...you...ready?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.275
-Hell yes!
-You know it!

11:51.449 --> 11:53.887
I gotta check out
these scratchers first.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.672
Lesson number one--
uncle-ing happens on yourtime.

11:56.846 --> 11:59.719
"On our time."
Got it.

11:59.893 --> 12:03.940
Damn it! I was three cherries
away, man! Three!

12:04.114 --> 12:06.464
[Adult Adam]
Yep, we were about to learn
everything not to do.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.249
Think about it.
The kid's parents aren't gonna

12:08.423 --> 12:10.773
bail on him
for holidays and birthdays,

12:10.947 --> 12:13.341
so it leaves the door wide open
for youto bail on them.

12:13.515 --> 12:16.257
"Bail on significant
life events."

12:16.431 --> 12:18.041
Another important function
of the uncle

12:18.215 --> 12:21.131
is to provide
a loophole around the
"legal drinking age."

12:21.305 --> 12:23.612
"Play fast and loose
with our nation's laws."

12:23.786 --> 12:25.092
Where's the queen?
Where's the queen?

12:25.266 --> 12:26.397
Where can it be?
Where can the queen be?

12:26.571 --> 12:28.051
Is it over here?
Can the queen be here?

12:28.225 --> 12:30.097
The queen is here. Is it here?
Where's the queen?

12:30.271 --> 12:31.315
I'm so convinced
she's on the left,

12:31.489 --> 12:33.100
I will up my bet to $20.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.841
-Ooh, wrong again.
-Damn it!

12:35.015 --> 12:36.364
That was
my textbook money!

12:36.538 --> 12:38.801
Now it's my chicken-fried
steak money. Ba-bam!

12:38.975 --> 12:41.151
"Swindle children
without remorse."

12:41.325 --> 12:43.588
Most uncle-ing happens
around the margins.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.547
-[sniffs]
-Baby's first R-rated movie?

12:45.721 --> 12:47.070
-[fingers snap]-That's where you come in.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.637
Baby needs a diaper change?

12:48.811 --> 12:49.725
-[fingers snap]
-That's where you go out.

12:49.899 --> 12:50.813
You getting all this?

12:50.987 --> 12:51.945
"Be the worst." Got it.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.555
Okay, let's recap.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.513
If the kid's birthday
is April 10th,

12:55.687 --> 12:57.080
when should
your card arrive?

12:57.254 --> 12:59.474
-Never.
-Cards are a gateway to gifts.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.912
And now you know all
the knowledge known to man.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.306
Why does your notepad
say "opposite"?

13:05.480 --> 13:06.655
Uh...

13:07.482 --> 13:08.831
Uh...

13:09.614 --> 13:11.355
Uh...

13:13.227 --> 13:15.272
"Never do the following."

13:15.446 --> 13:16.926
Geez, Bar!
You could have been

13:17.100 --> 13:18.798
a bit more savvy
with your note-taking.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.322
Did you two come here
to learn how notto be uncles?

13:21.496 --> 13:23.803
Uncle Marvin,
it's nothing personal.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.543
We think
you're the greatest.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.589
You're super fun,
like our own Uncle Buck.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.634
Except, you know,
not exactly a model

13:29.809 --> 13:31.288
of reliability
and follow-through.

13:31.462 --> 13:35.031
So I'm a joke. A dope.
A screw-up.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.554
See? He gets it.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.252
[telephone rings]

13:38.426 --> 13:39.862
Can I call you back?

13:40.036 --> 13:41.603
I gotta pull this knife
from my chest.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.910
Huh? Y-Yeah.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.390
Hold on. It's for you.
Sounds like
someone real sweaty.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.218
Geoff?

13:48.392 --> 13:49.524
Oh, thank God!
The JTP said you were there

13:49.698 --> 13:51.395
getting "opposite
uncle lessons"?

13:51.569 --> 13:53.136
Don't explain.
Your sister's having a baby.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.703
You need to get your mom.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.313
She drank too much ice wine
at the beach house.

13:56.487 --> 13:57.749
The New Hope hospital.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.490
-New Hope. Got it!
-[receiver hangs up]

13:59.664 --> 14:01.536
We gotta jam.
Erica's having a baby.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.843
Congrats! Oh, wow.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.888
That sounds like something
that I might kinda

14:06.062 --> 14:07.455
want to be a part of.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.326
But only on
your own time.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.242
Yeah. No obligations, right?
See you whenever.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.983
[Adult Adam]
As we were off to get our mom,

14:14.157 --> 14:16.943
Geoff finally had everything
under control.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.466
Barry and Adam are on their way
to get your mom

14:18.640 --> 14:19.989
and bring her here,
and I talked to Scotty.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.599
Turns out he just
took over the practice

14:21.773 --> 14:23.166
from his recently retired
father,

14:23.340 --> 14:24.472
so I had him ask his dad
to come in.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.517
-Oh, phew.
-Greetings!

14:26.691 --> 14:29.999
You must be, uh,
Greta and...Eric?

14:30.173 --> 14:32.959
Uh, it's Geoff and Erica.
She's Erica.

14:33.133 --> 14:36.005
Confound it.
Where did I put my bifocals?

14:36.179 --> 14:37.789
-That's Scotty's father?
-[door closes]

14:37.964 --> 14:39.443
Was it, like,
a second marriage?

14:39.617 --> 14:41.576
Isn't there a generation
in between? Or two even?

14:41.750 --> 14:43.404
I don't know
their family history.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.101
I'm learning
in real time

14:45.275 --> 14:46.624
that they represent
the extremes
of the age spectrum.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.365
I want my mom.
I want my mom now!

14:48.539 --> 14:50.367
She's coming,
but in the meantime,

14:50.541 --> 14:51.803
I found some other
comforting adults.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.153
Mazel tov!

14:53.327 --> 14:54.937
We couldn't be
more excited!

14:55.111 --> 14:56.417
Absolutely not.

14:56.591 --> 14:57.418
But they're my parents.

14:57.592 --> 14:58.985
And I'm a man
of medicine.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.988
You work on eyes!
Go help our blind doctor!

15:02.162 --> 15:04.947
-We'll be in the waiting room.
-She's very scary!

15:05.121 --> 15:07.254
[Adult Adam]
While storm clouds were brewing
over the delivery room,

15:07.428 --> 15:08.908
Barry and I were
driving our mom

15:09.082 --> 15:10.561
through some
pretty steady rain.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.302
Thank you, boys,
for picking me up.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.043
Of course, Mama.
Nothing could stop us

15:14.217 --> 15:15.436
from getting you
to that hospital.

15:15.610 --> 15:16.654
[engine revs]

15:16.828 --> 15:18.526
What the--

15:18.700 --> 15:20.745
Damn it!
We're stuck in mud!

15:20.920 --> 15:22.138
-[horn honks]
-Dirt's wet cousin!

15:22.312 --> 15:25.620
[crying] No!

15:25.794 --> 15:28.231
Okay, this is lightly on me for
saying nothing could stop us.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.412
[Adult Adam] Erica's baby
was coming any minute,

15:35.586 --> 15:38.720
but we weren't going anywhere,
so Barry swung into action.

15:38.894 --> 15:42.245
My Lou Ferrigno-like strength
will get us out of this mess!

15:42.419 --> 15:44.334
Hit it, Adam,
and I'll push!

15:44.508 --> 15:47.381
One! Two!

15:47.555 --> 15:48.730
Three!

15:48.904 --> 15:51.037
[engine revs]

15:51.211 --> 15:54.518
Oh, no.

15:54.692 --> 15:57.347
My contemporary
stylish pants!

15:57.521 --> 15:58.783
And we're deeper in.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.917
Get over. Get over.
Ugh!

16:02.091 --> 16:04.485
Well, thank you
for trying, boys.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.443
You did good.
Unlike Geoffrey.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.315
Oh, don't be so hard
on him, Mama.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.317
Yeah, that nervous nerd
means well.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.710
Oh, I will be
plentyhard on him.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.582
He made me miss the birth
of my grandchild

16:14.756 --> 16:17.106
and future best friend!

16:17.280 --> 16:19.804
[Adult Adam]
Yeah, all hope was lost,
and then this happened.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.850
-[brakes squeal]
-Oh, no!

16:22.024 --> 16:23.460
It's an unsophisticated
rural type!

16:23.634 --> 16:24.940
He'll know we're not
from these parts

16:25.114 --> 16:26.202
and make quick work
of us city folk!

16:26.376 --> 16:28.248
What-- Duck down!

16:28.422 --> 16:30.250
Ow! I'm not
limber enough!

16:30.424 --> 16:32.643
Damn my careless attitude
towards exercise!

16:32.817 --> 16:34.341
Adam, Adam, tempt him
with your soft eyes

16:34.515 --> 16:36.082
so I can hit him
with my shoes, okay?

16:36.256 --> 16:38.475
No, I won't be
your hillbilly bait.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.174
Adam, just befriend
the country gentleman

16:41.348 --> 16:43.654
so your brother
can sucker-punch
him with his footwear!

16:43.828 --> 16:46.440
It wasn't a good plan,
but fortunately,
we didn't need it.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.398
-Marvin?
-How's it going?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.835
-What are you doing here?
-I'm rescuing my family.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.924
Was I cool?
It sounded cool.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.232
[laughs] Let's ride!
We got a baby to meet!

16:56.406 --> 16:57.973
Hah! That was
really fun to say.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.409
You saved us,
Uncle Marvin!

16:59.583 --> 17:01.107
I know. I'm trying
to be a better uncle.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.630
How about I go to the hospital
with you guys?

17:02.804 --> 17:05.415
-We'd love that!
-For sure!

17:05.589 --> 17:07.765
[Adult Adam]
Sure, he may have been
a screw-up like Uncle Buck,

17:07.939 --> 17:10.290
but that night,
Uncle Marvin was a hero,

17:10.464 --> 17:12.901
and not a moment too soon.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.251
-Oh, God, it hurts!
-I'm so sorry, my love.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.297
I would take all the pain
if I could.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.168
I wish you could, too.
All of it!

17:19.342 --> 17:21.518
-Erica, it's time.
-Time?

17:21.692 --> 17:22.998
Oh, you mean the thing that
you don't have much left of?

17:23.172 --> 17:24.304
Sorry.
The pain and my failures

17:24.478 --> 17:25.566
have made my lady-love
very direct.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.133
She's here!

17:27.307 --> 17:28.569
You may have
this baby now.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.266
Mom!

17:30.440 --> 17:33.139
Beverly Goldberg.
Mama of the mama.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.445
Babe, you did it.
Thank you.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.360
I love you so much.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.189
Doctor, if you need help,
I'm almost a doctor.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.191
I'm not at all a doctor,
and I just accidentally

17:42.365 --> 17:43.714
saw some stuff,
so I'm gonna wait outside.

17:43.888 --> 17:47.022
You all need to wait outside,
except for the husband!

17:47.196 --> 17:51.200
And her.
She stays, too.

17:51.374 --> 17:54.029
[Adult Adam]
Despite being stuck hours
away in the pouring rain,

17:54.203 --> 17:56.684
we'd pulled off a miracle.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.381
Sure, she wasn't thrilled
with Geoff,

17:58.555 --> 18:01.689
but in that moment,
all my mom could think about

18:01.863 --> 18:03.734
was that her baby
was about to have a baby.

And just like that, the person

19:01.879 --> 19:04.186
we had all been waiting for
finally arrived.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.710
It's a girl.

19:06.884 --> 19:10.714
That day, the world welcomed
a new Goldberg.

19:10.888 --> 19:14.675
Everyone, meet Muriel Allison
Goldberg Schwartz.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.678
Muriel, after Murray.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.854
Is Allison
for Albert?

19:20.028 --> 19:22.030
You know it.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.946
Pops would be so proud.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.688
[Adult Adam]
Yeah, in a year filled
with too many goodbyes,

19:27.862 --> 19:30.430
this was a hello
that brought us all together,

19:30.604 --> 19:32.693
even those of us
no longer here.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.738
'Cause nothing
fills you with hope

19:34.912 --> 19:36.958
more than a brand-new baby.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.265
Mrs. G,
I-I need to apologize.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.789
[gasps] Geoffrey,
you shut your sweet mouth.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.270
After what
you've given me today,

19:44.444 --> 19:47.055
you don't ever need to
apologize to me again.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.839
♪♪ It isn't too hard to see ♪♪

19:49.013 --> 19:51.407
Oh, so beautiful.

19:51.581 --> 19:54.932
Perfection.
Sheer perfection.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.717
[Adult Adam] She really was.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.067
Muriel changed all our lives
that day.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.721
You dopes
want to hold your niece?

20:00.895 --> 20:02.766
-Seriously?
-Could we?

20:02.940 --> 20:05.508
[Adult Adam]
I'd never held a baby before.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.990
I couldn't believe how tiny
and warm and sweet she felt

20:09.164 --> 20:11.732
and how I could immediately
love someone I just met.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.343
I know what I said before,

20:14.517 --> 20:16.302
but you two are
going to be amazing uncles.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.738
How could we not?

20:17.912 --> 20:18.869
We learned
from the best.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.873
I do what I can.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.224
[Adult Adam]
Yeah, our family had gone
through a lot that year,

20:25.398 --> 20:28.314
but that's the amazing thing
about life.

20:28.488 --> 20:31.360
Just when you think things
will never be okay again,

20:31.534 --> 20:34.537
here comes a miracle
that proves you way wrong.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.887
I'm a bubbe!

20:37.061 --> 20:39.325
And that is
pretty damn awesome.

20:46.332 --> 20:50.031
I think we all can agree that
Uncle Buck did one thing right,

20:50.205 --> 20:51.989
and that's
the giant pancake.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.601
-Big is beautiful.
-He wasted so much food!

20:54.775 --> 20:57.386
But why stop there, when
there are so many other meals

20:57.560 --> 20:59.258
that we can enlarge to their
atomic breaking point?

20:59.432 --> 21:00.911
Let us begin!

21:01.085 --> 21:05.176
Behold the McMarvin
quarter tonner!

21:05.351 --> 21:06.482
-I don't know where
to put my mouth.
-I do.

21:06.656 --> 21:07.831
I always do.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.662
Two gallons of Rocky Road
carefully molded

21:12.836 --> 21:15.099
into a single scoop
of creamy deliciousness.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.971
Sorry, belly,
you're in trouble.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.060
Nuts and marshmallows
for days!

21:19.234 --> 21:20.322
Meatballs!

21:20.496 --> 21:22.585
Oh, yeah.
Get the sauce.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.108
-Mmm.
-Should the middle
be this pink?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.414
Or this cold?

21:27.024 --> 21:29.288
Bigger is not better.
Movies have failed us!

21:29.462 --> 21:29.940
Ohh!
