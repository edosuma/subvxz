[Banging On Metal]

02:37.437 --> 02:40.338
Gauthier ?

02:40.407 --> 02:43.535
Gauthier.
Gauthier !

02:46.947 --> 02:48.915

[Banging On Metal]

[Muffled Shouting]

05:18.765 --> 05:21.256
Hold the elevator.
Hold it ! Hold it !

05:29.709 --> 05:33.406
Agent Scully, can I see you
for a few minutes ?

05:39.619 --> 05:42.816
- Kimberly, would you excuse us please ?
- Certainly, sir.

05:49.362 --> 05:51.887
A memo came across my desk last night.
I debated whether or not...

05:51.998 --> 05:55.126
- to call you at home but I decided to--
- And it concerns me ?

05:55.201 --> 05:57.999
Yes, and your sister.

05:58.071 --> 06:01.336
It's been five months and there
have been no new leads or evidence...

06:01.408 --> 06:04.172
in her murder investigation by
the D.C. Police team or the Bureau.

06:06.212 --> 06:09.670
I've been told the case is to be made
inactive until further notice.

06:13.386 --> 06:16.822
- I see.
- I don't think there's anything
to be read into this.

06:16.890 --> 06:19.984
I think it's a case
of manpower and workload.

06:20.093 --> 06:23.085
I want you to know, though, that
I am going to appeal this decision,

06:23.196 --> 06:25.130
and I am gonna go back over all
the evidence again myself...

06:25.198 --> 06:27.132
to make sure that nothing
has been overlooked.

06:37.277 --> 06:40.075
You know, it's strange.

06:43.650 --> 06:47.552
Men can blow up buildings and they can
be nowhere near the crime scene,

06:47.620 --> 06:50.555
but we can piece together the evidence
and convict them beyond a doubt.

06:50.623 --> 06:53.888
Our labs here
can recreate,

06:53.993 --> 06:56.553
out of the most
microscopic detail,

06:56.663 --> 07:00.064
the motivation and circumstance
to almost any murder,

07:00.133 --> 07:04.536
right down to a killer's
attitude towards his mother
and that he was a bed wetter.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.438
But in a case of a woman,

07:08.508 --> 07:10.669
my sister,

07:10.744 --> 07:14.805
who was gunned down in cold blood
in a well-lit apartment building...

07:14.881 --> 07:19.784
by a shooter who left the weapon
at the crime scene,

07:19.853 --> 07:23.755
we can't even put together
enough to keep anybody interested.

07:23.823 --> 07:26.690
I don't think this has
anything to do with interest.

07:26.793 --> 07:30.991
If I may say so, sir,
it has everything to do with interest.

07:31.064 --> 07:34.898
just not yours...
and not mine.

07:43.343 --> 07:45.402
-[Knock On Door]
- Yeah ?

07:45.478 --> 07:47.605
Sorry I'm late.

07:47.680 --> 07:52.947
-Anything up ?
- No, it's nothing.

07:53.019 --> 07:55.886
What did you want
to talk to me about ?

07:55.955 --> 07:59.083
Something interesting
came into my attention last night.

07:59.192 --> 08:02.559
A French salvage ship,
the Piper Maru,

08:02.629 --> 08:04.563
Limped into port
in San Diego yesterday,

08:04.631 --> 08:06.599
all the way from
the North Pacific.

08:06.666 --> 08:09.100
Why is that
of interest ?

08:09.169 --> 08:11.194
Using the National Weather
Service satellite system,

08:11.271 --> 08:13.205
I was able
to track its course.

08:13.273 --> 08:16.003
This was
its original position.

08:16.075 --> 08:19.943
At longitude 1 71 east,
latitude 42 north.

08:20.013 --> 08:22.106
Yeah, that's where the boat
we know as the Talapus...

08:22.182 --> 08:24.116
pulled up what you believe
was a Russian sub,

08:24.184 --> 08:26.675
-and what I believe
was the remains of a UFO.
- Oh, Mulder--

08:26.753 --> 08:28.948
Look, Scully, I don't know what it is,
but something is still down there...

08:29.022 --> 08:30.649
and now the French
are looking for it too.

08:30.723 --> 08:33.214
- So what ?
- So why all the attention
paid to this site ?

08:33.326 --> 08:35.919
- What information are they acting on ?
- Why don't you just ask them ?

08:36.029 --> 08:38.929
I would, but the entire crew
is being treated for radiation burns.

08:38.998 --> 08:40.431
From exposure to what ?

08:40.500 --> 08:43.799
The French government is keeping
that information classified.

08:43.870 --> 08:46.771
Could it have anything to do with
their resumption of nuclear tests ?

08:46.840 --> 08:50.105
I checked. It's thousands of miles
away from any test site.

08:50.176 --> 08:52.542
- [ Giggles ]
- What ?

08:52.612 --> 08:57.311
I'm just constantly
amazed by you. I--

08:57.383 --> 08:59.374
You're working down here
in the basement,

08:59.452 --> 09:02.512
sifting through files
and transmissions...

09:02.589 --> 09:04.989
that any other agent would
just throw away in the garbage.

09:05.058 --> 09:07.026
Well, that's why I'm
in the basement, Scully.

09:07.093 --> 09:10.426
You're in the basement because
they're afraid of you,

09:10.496 --> 09:12.487
of your relentlessness,

09:12.599 --> 09:15.898
and because they know that they could
drop you in the middle of the desert...

09:15.969 --> 09:19.132
and tell you the truth is out there,
and you'd ask them for a shovel.

09:19.205 --> 09:22.231
Is that what you think of me ?

09:22.308 --> 09:24.708
Well, maybe not a shovel.

09:24.777 --> 09:26.836
Maybe a backhoe.

09:26.913 --> 09:30.280
That's good, because there's
some garbage in San Diego...

09:30.350 --> 09:32.545
I want you to help me
dig through.

09:52.805 --> 09:55.433
- [ Mulder] Dr. Seizer ?
- Yes.

09:55.508 --> 09:58.443
Special Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.

09:58.511 --> 10:00.672
You're here about these French sailors
with the radiation exposure ?

10:00.747 --> 10:04.012
- How are they doing ?
- Not real good.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.017
It’s been difficult to determine
a proper course of treatment,

10:06.085 --> 10:08.553
because there's an air of secrecy
around what happened.

10:08.621 --> 10:11.215
The source of their exposure
is still undetermined.

10:13.526 --> 10:17.428
These symptoms, would you characterize
them as acute or somatic ?

10:18.665 --> 10:21.532
I'm a medical doctor.

10:21.601 --> 10:25.537
They're somatic, although I don't
think we’ve seen the worst of it.

10:25.605 --> 10:28.267
The effects are degrading rapidly,
spontaneous internal bleeding...

10:28.341 --> 10:30.866
in the mouth sand intestinal tracts,
blood in the urine.

10:30.944 --> 10:35.381
All these men
are suffering severe delirium,
the pre-advanced stages of coma.

10:35.448 --> 10:37.643
What kind of exposure
are we talking about here ?

10:37.717 --> 10:41.483
Two hundred,
maybe four hundred roentgens,
with a high rate of absorption.

10:41.554 --> 10:44.455
That's verging on the levels
the victims of Hiroshima suffered.

10:44.524 --> 10:47.618
Whatever these men came in contact with,
it was manmade.

10:47.727 --> 10:50.355
Levels like this
just don't appear in nature.

10:50.496 --> 10:53.260
Not on this planet.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.597
Did you get the chance
to talk to any of them ?

10:55.668 --> 10:58.637
No, they were in pretty bad shape
by the time they got tome,

10:58.705 --> 11:00.798
except for one man,
and this was strange,

11:00.873 --> 11:03.535
because he was the only one who seemed
to be completely unaffected.

11:03.609 --> 11:08.103
I held him for the first day,
but I detected none of
the symptoms of the others.

11:08.181 --> 11:11.014
His leukocytes and
erythrocytes were high.

11:11.084 --> 11:13.177
- Actually, he was in very good health.
- How could that be ?

11:13.252 --> 11:16.483
With that level of radiation,
how could one man not be exposed ?

11:16.589 --> 11:18.523
Doesn't make any sense.

11:18.591 --> 11:22.391
But it's lucky for these men because
he was the one who piloted the boat in.

11:22.462 --> 11:24.828
And none of these men could've
done that in their condition.

11:24.897 --> 11:27.491
Would it be possible for us
to talk to him ?

11:27.567 --> 11:31.970
You could if he were still here,
but he discharged himself this morning.

11:32.038 --> 11:35.667
He’s a Frenchman, has a San Francisco
address, his name is Gauthier.

and get in the truck.

12:20.753 --> 12:23.449
[Scully]I'm getting no answer
at this man Gauthier's home number.

12:23.556 --> 12:26.389
Try the I.N.S. or the French Consulate,
see what you can pull on him.

12:26.459 --> 12:28.984
Right there !

12:29.095 --> 12:32.189
[Scully] Yes, could I have the number
for the French Consulate please ?

12:32.265 --> 12:35.132
-Agents Mulder and Scully, F.B.I.
- I'm Wayne Morgan.

12:35.201 --> 12:40.264
- I'm with the Navy's
investigative services unit.
- Have you turned anything up ?

12:40.339 --> 12:43.536
No, nothing, but I'm not exactly sure
what I'm supposed to be looking for.

12:43.609 --> 12:46.134
- The crew of this ship is
being treated for radiation.
- Yeah, we got all that.

12:46.212 --> 12:48.646
We had a hazmat team
poring over the boat.

12:48.714 --> 12:50.909
- Didn't find a trace.
- Nothing ?

12:50.983 --> 12:54.248
We have divers in the water going over
the hull, put probes down the bilge.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.413
Couldn't detect
the slightest level.

12:56.522 --> 12:59.719
- So it's okay for us to go on board ?
-Sure.

12:59.826 --> 13:03.057
Probably get more radiation
off your cell phone.

14:13.966 --> 14:16.833

Generator’s back up.

14:16.903 --> 14:19.531
- That better ?
- Yeah. Thanks.

14:19.605 --> 14:21.539
Is this the way
you found this room ?

14:21.607 --> 14:24.440
Nothing’s been touched, not since
she’s been tied up here anyway.

14:24.510 --> 14:26.910
- It's a mess, huh ?
- Feels like home.

14:26.979 --> 14:30.244
Feels like somebody was looking
for something. Any idea what ?

14:30.316 --> 14:34.252
- No. I'm looking for the V.C.R.
- What for?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.584
The dive suit
has a video camera.

14:46.566 --> 14:49.091
[Morgan]
What the hell is that ?

14:49.168 --> 14:51.796
Looks like the fuselage
of a plane.

14:51.871 --> 14:54.897
It's a North American
P-51 Mustang.

14:54.974 --> 14:56.908
Yeah, it sure is.

14:56.976 --> 15:00.844
- I just got very turned on.
- It's the shape of the canopy.

15:00.913 --> 15:02.778
I used to watch my father
and brothers put together...

15:02.848 --> 15:05.442
World War II
model planes as a kid.

15:05.518 --> 15:07.452
[Mulder] Would it have been
carrying anything radioactive ?

15:07.520 --> 15:10.683
- No. It was just a fighter.
- Then what was it those men
were exposed to ?

15:10.790 --> 15:14.920
I don't know, but I might
know somebody I can ask.

15:45.224 --> 15:47.317
-[Door Opens]
- You’re home!

15:47.426 --> 15:50.589
I was so worried
about you !

15:50.663 --> 15:52.563
Why didn’t you
call me ?

15:52.632 --> 15:55.066
There were these men here
from the Consulate.

15:55.134 --> 15:57.068
They said there'd been
an accident.

16:00.573 --> 16:02.837
Why aren’t you
answering me ?

16:14.787 --> 16:16.812
Why aren’t you
answering me ?

16:54.226 --> 16:57.024
Hi. I'm here to see
Commander Johansen.

16:57.096 --> 17:01.533
- Name, please.
- Special Agent Dana Scully, F.B.I.

17:01.634 --> 17:06.162
- Do you have an appointment ?
- No. Uh, he use to be
a friend of my father's.

17:06.271 --> 17:09.241
I'm out here from Washington.
I wanted to surprise him.

17:09.308 --> 17:12.334
- Let me give you directions.
- I know my way. Thanks.

I want you to lie still.
I'm with the F.B.I.

20:02.281 --> 20:05.614
- What happened ? Did you fall ?
- I don't know.

20:05.684 --> 20:08.016
How did you get here ?

20:08.087 --> 20:12.023
I can't remember.
I was on the boat.

20:12.091 --> 20:15.219
The Piper Maru ?
That's the last thing you remember ?

20:15.294 --> 20:18.661
Yes. I was on a dive.

20:18.731 --> 20:22.098
Okay. Do you know
where you are now ?

20:22.201 --> 20:25.170
I'm at home.
Where's my wife ?

20:25.271 --> 20:28.536
Nobody else is home, but somebody's
been here going through your papers.

20:28.607 --> 20:32.168
- Where’s Joan ?
- She's not here.
Look, l-- You need to be careful.

20:32.244 --> 20:34.212
You've got some kind of oil
all over you.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.805
What's going on here ?

20:36.882 --> 20:39.180
I want you to try
to remain calm, okay ?

20:39.251 --> 20:42.948
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about a letter,

20:43.022 --> 20:47.322
about a J. Kallenchuk
Salvage Brokers.

20:47.393 --> 20:49.361
I don't recognize that name.

20:49.428 --> 20:52.522
Well, somebody did,
and I think you know why.

20:53.933 --> 20:56.493
I would like to speak
to the French Consul General.

20:56.602 --> 20:58.536
I have nothing more
to say.

21:01.907 --> 21:03.807

He'll be right out.

21:10.049 --> 21:12.449
Yes ?

21:12.518 --> 21:14.611
Commander Johansen ?

21:14.687 --> 21:17.019
- Yes.
- I'm Dana Scully.

21:17.089 --> 21:19.455
I used to live
three doors down.

21:19.525 --> 21:21.618
My father was
Captain William Scully.

21:21.694 --> 21:23.719
I went to school
with your son.

21:23.796 --> 21:28.733
I'm sorry. Um-- My memory isn't
quite what it used to be.

21:28.801 --> 21:31.292
Richard doesn't
live here anymore.

21:31.403 --> 21:34.429
- Actually, sir, l-- I came to see you.
- Oh.

21:34.540 --> 21:39.671
I work for the F.B.I. now,
and there's a question that
I'm hoping that you can answer.

21:39.745 --> 21:42.805
Oh, well,
would you come in ?

21:42.881 --> 21:44.815
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

21:44.883 --> 21:48.216
- Would you like something to drink ?
- No, thanks.

21:51.190 --> 21:54.591
I know that you were an officer in
the Pacific theater during World War ll.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.629
I wanted to ask you about
a plane that's been discovered.

21:57.696 --> 22:00.392
- Discovered ?
- Yes. A P-51 Mustang...

22:00.499 --> 22:03.263
at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean
with the, uh,

22:03.369 --> 22:08.602
call numbers JTT0 111470.

22:08.674 --> 22:11.370
Well, those are not
the call numbers of P-51 .

22:11.443 --> 22:15.937
There was an illustration on the
fuselage with the words "Drop Dead Red. "

22:17.850 --> 22:19.784
I'm sorry.

22:19.852 --> 22:22.719
Would the words "Zeus Faber"
mean anything to you ?

22:24.923 --> 22:30.793

[Phone Ringing]

40:47.492 --> 40:51.986
- Scully.
- Agent Scully, this is Kim Cook
from the director's office.

40:52.063 --> 40:54.998
- Yes.
- We’ve just got some bad news.

40:55.099 --> 40:57.067
A.D. Skinner's
just been shot.

40:57.135 --> 40:59.797
- When ?
- About an hour ago.

40:59.904 --> 41:02.429
He's been taken
to Northeast Georgetown.

41:02.540 --> 41:04.531
I'm on my way.

41:30.034 --> 41:32.093
That's for your partner.

41:32.170 --> 41:34.798
This is for me.

41:37.175 --> 41:39.336
- And this is for my father !
- No !

41:39.410 --> 41:42.277
- I didn't kill your father.
- Now you tell me.

41:42.346 --> 41:45.179
- It wasn't me.
- Oh, yeah ? Then who was it ?

41:45.249 --> 41:51.051
- I don't know.
- Either way, Krycek, you're a liar.

41:51.155 --> 41:54.022
Come on. Finish it, Mulder.
Come on ! Finish it !

41:54.091 --> 41:56.082
Do it !

41:56.194 --> 41:59.960
I want
that digital tape.

42:00.031 --> 42:03.364
- I don't have it.
- Like hell you don't.

42:03.434 --> 42:05.766
That tape contains the secrets you were
selling as well as everything else...

42:05.837 --> 42:08.635
our government knows about
the existence of extraterrestrial life.

42:08.706 --> 42:10.640
How could I sell anything ?
The tape was encrypted.

42:10.708 --> 42:15.441
- Obviously, you found a way.
- I don't have it, but...

42:15.513 --> 42:17.845
I'll give it to you
if you let me go.

42:17.915 --> 42:20.440
Where is it ?

42:20.518 --> 42:24.545
D.C. In a locker.

42:33.965 --> 42:36.661
No.

42:39.470 --> 42:41.404
If you let me go,
I'll tell you.

42:44.909 --> 42:47.503
You put that tape in my hands,
and we'll talk about it.

42:47.578 --> 42:51.070
Why don't you go to the bathroom
and clean yourself off?

42:51.148 --> 42:54.743
If you’re not out
of there in three minutes,
I'm coming in there to kill you.

43:54.845 --> 43:56.779
Feel better ?
