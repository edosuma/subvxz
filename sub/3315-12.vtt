WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.171
Honey, you gotta come see this.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.557
I'm gonna go.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.560
I'm taking Violet
and going to Jo's.

00:18.769 --> 00:19.853
Florida?

00:19.937 --> 00:22.022
I want to get there before
the school year starts.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.233
I don't understand.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.692
What about Los Angeles?

00:25.776 --> 00:27.569
I thought we agreed
about the fresh start.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.323
I just can't.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.659
-We really tried.
-We haven't tried.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.952
I can't do it anymore.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.495
Therapy isn't trying.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.122
It's just figuring stuff out,
so you can really do something.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.290
I've tried.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.503
And as much as
I keep trying to let you in again,

00:44.586 --> 00:45.963
this wall comes up,

00:47.339 --> 00:50.175
and I... I can't...
I can't get past it.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.260
Just look at this house.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.137
Look at this house I found.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.222
It's right near Hancock Park,

00:55.305 --> 00:56.890
where all those big mansions
from the '20s are.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.934
You always talked about
how much you wanted a house like this,

00:59.017 --> 01:00.227
one with personality.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.603
Well, here it is.

01:01.687 --> 01:02.729
You don't listen.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.066
A house isn't gonna fix it, Ben.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.277
It's just a house, Viv.
Come on.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.570
Take a look.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.865
It's nice, right?

01:12.948 --> 01:14.867
Tiffany lamps and everything.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.702
I don't know.
Maybe it's haunted or something.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.954
I mean, it's still a stretch
at that price,

01:19.037 --> 01:21.999
but it's been on the market for a while,
so maybe they'll go lower.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.586
There's even an office,
so I can see patients at home.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.588
I mean, it's perfect.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.755
No.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.009
Honey...

01:32.092 --> 01:34.678
Honey, the reason
you can't hold on to this idea of leaving

01:34.761 --> 01:36.847
is because it's not
what you want.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.141
I... I've been looking
at houses for a month,

01:39.224 --> 01:41.935
and when I found this one,
I swear to God, it was like a...

01:42.019 --> 01:44.396
It was like a laser beam
shot right into my brain.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.190
I could see it all so clearly.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.775
It was like a movie
in my mind.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.653
We were together,
you, me and Violet, all around the fire.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.573
Violet was reading some
depressing Russian novel,

01:54.656 --> 02:00.579
and I was stoking the fire,
and you were on the couch, rocking a baby.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.539
-Honey...
-(sniffles)

02:02.623 --> 02:04.333
We have made
so many life choices

02:04.416 --> 02:07.628
based on our gut,
and right now,

02:07.711 --> 02:09.922
my gut is telling me
that this place,

02:10.714 --> 02:12.758
this house,
is gonna...

02:12.841 --> 02:14.676
It's gonna break down
that wall inside you.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.474
I'm sure
it's a beautiful house.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.894
I love you so much.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.104
I'm begging you.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.566
Just come see the house.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.568
The three of us
will fly out.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.363
Just come see it.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.115
When I look at this place,

02:37.199 --> 02:41.370
for the first time I feel
like there's hope.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.666
Vivien?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.090
Vivien!

02:54.466 --> 02:56.051
Violet!

02:56.718 --> 02:58.053
Vivien!

02:59.388 --> 03:00.931
BEN:
<i>Where are you, Vivien?</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:02.140
Vivien!

03:12.401 --> 03:14.152
BEN: <i>Where are you?</i>

04:17.174 --> 04:19.843
CONSTANCE:
We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.678
After the service.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.765
I know, but I can't impose
on you like this, Constance.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.935
Don't be silly.
Looking after this little angel

04:28.018 --> 04:30.229
is no imposition whatsoever.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.773
And I wouldn't think
of burdening you

04:32.856 --> 04:35.609
with the care of a newborn
during this time of your

04:35.692 --> 04:37.444
unspeakable tragedy.

04:37.528 --> 04:41.532
Thank you, but Vivien's sister
is here now, so...

04:42.574 --> 04:44.201
Oh, I see. (chuckles)

04:45.661 --> 04:50.499
What a blessing
distant relations are in times of trouble.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.917
If I could just get his things...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.961
Certainly, uh...

04:54.044 --> 04:56.463
Though it is
nearly his lunchtime.

04:56.547 --> 04:59.007
I know. Why don't I feed him?

04:59.091 --> 05:01.051
He'll fall right asleep,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.387
and then you can come back
in several hours.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.181
-I can feed him.
-It's really no trouble at all.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.517
I'm here to get my son,
Constance.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.935
Your son, of course.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.688
Let me just
gather up his things.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.859
This formula
has to be warmed up.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.193
All you have to do is run it

05:18.277 --> 05:19.778
-under the hot water tap.
-I'll be fine.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.364
No, I don't believe you will,
nor will that child,

05:22.447 --> 05:24.449
if you take him back
into that house.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.659
Just give me his things.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.578
Dr. Harmon, hear me.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.205
There are forces
in that house

05:30.289 --> 05:33.458
that mean to do this child
grave harm.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.419
We both know that it's true.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.172
The same forces
that killed your sweet wife.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.507
Oh, and what about
your daughter?

05:41.675 --> 05:45.429
Tell me, Dr. Harmon, did you
buy a casket for Violet, too?

05:47.306 --> 05:50.100
If that house
can claim her spirit,

05:50.184 --> 05:52.436
what's going to happen
to this sweet little baby?

05:52.519 --> 05:54.438
-The baby's gonna be fine.
-You are a fool!

05:54.521 --> 05:56.481
After everything
that you've seen...

05:56.565 --> 05:57.941
(baby crying)

05:58.025 --> 06:00.527
After everything
that has happened,

06:00.611 --> 06:02.738
how can you still
be so blind?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.245
-CONSTANCE: Hello?
-Hey, it's Ben Harmon, Tate's therapist.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.081
Yeah, I'm calling
because I can't treat your son anymore.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.834
I'd like to give you
the number of another psychiatrist

06:15.918 --> 06:17.169
who I think could help him.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.295
Oh, no, but why, Doctor?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.798
<i>Because your son</i>
<i>has crossed a line with my daughter.</i>

06:21.882 --> 06:23.884
-Oh, but...
<i>-I'm so sorry.</i>

06:26.470 --> 06:27.513
Where is he?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.556
In his grave.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.478
Where he's been
longer than he lived on this earth.

06:34.686 --> 06:38.273
You destroyed my family.
You!

06:38.357 --> 06:43.403
You are paying for
your own sins, Dr. Harmon.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.863
Let me give you some advice.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.824
When I leave here,
lock your door

06:47.908 --> 06:49.701
and pray
I don't come back.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.119
Hmm.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.581
(door slams)

06:58.168 --> 07:00.379
I wonder, how is
your adjustment going?

07:00.838 --> 07:02.089
I've to say one of
the hardest things

07:02.172 --> 07:03.215
is watching Ben.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.967
He's so devastated.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.178
Yes, well, it's always
the living that make it hard.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.638
(door closes)

07:10.556 --> 07:12.015
MOIRA: You don't need
to run off, dear.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.142
He can't see you
unless you want him to.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.521
Right. I keep forgetting.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.107
(cooing)

07:21.525 --> 07:23.235
I want to nurse him so badly.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.782
No, Ben. Not the microwave.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.416
You're hovering, dear.
It's a bad idea.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.877
-See. He remembered.
-(cooing)

07:40.043 --> 07:41.670
He was a good dad.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.006
Moira, I know
you don't approve,

07:44.089 --> 07:46.633
but despite all his flaws,

07:47.759 --> 07:49.011
he's a good father.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.055
I'll never understand why you always
need to come to his defense.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.559
(Whispers)
Here you go.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.561
Do you want him to see you?
Is that what's going on?

07:57.728 --> 07:59.521
Are you fighting
the desire to appear?

07:59.605 --> 08:01.023
No, I do not
want him to see me.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.233
I absolutely do not want him
to see me or Violet.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.152
I have made her promise me.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.030
Because if he sees us,
then he's gonna want to stay here.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.158
-It's okay, kiddo.
-And he has to leave this house.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.119
And raise our baby.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.623
Then sit down and keep your distance.
Remember the endgame.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.416
It's all going to work out.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.682
(sighs)

08:35.766 --> 08:37.309
There's something about Ben
that's different.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.019
He's so sanguine.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.732
Perhaps he's dreaming of all the women
he can have relations with.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.610
Forgive me.
I suppose that was unkind.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.324
Moira, would you make me
a cup of tea, please?

08:52.407 --> 08:53.408
No.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.371
Your denial is impressive.
You're a ghost, Mrs. Harmon.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.914
I don't take orders
from ghosts.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.333
I'm your equal now
in this world.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.001
So you are.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.170
I owe you an apology.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.339
And I think
you should call me Vivien.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.882
I'd like that.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.846
Vivien, if I may...

09:14.888 --> 09:18.100
Leave him be.
Don't torture yourself.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.185
BEN: It's not your fault.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.606
None of this is.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.865
Your aunt Jo's
gonna be here soon.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.450
(baby crying)

09:45.043 --> 09:46.587
(crying stops)

10:30.714 --> 10:31.965
(sighs)

11:15.759 --> 11:18.011
-You can't do this.
-Vivien.

11:18.554 --> 11:21.265
I knew you were here.
Why didn't you come to me?

11:21.348 --> 11:22.933
It would just
make it worse.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.228
I want you to take
the baby and go.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.188
Just let me do it.
Then we can be together.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.023
No, no. No. No.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.317
That baby needs
a father, Ben.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.944
I'm not his father.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.613
You know it,
and I know it.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.533
He's my baby,
and you shouldn't be smoking.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.913
I don't really care
where it came from.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.790
I would give anything
if I could take care...

11:46.874 --> 11:49.293
Vivien, I am...

11:51.378 --> 11:54.923
...so sorry for everything
I put you through.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.216
I want you to hear me.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.886
I forgive you.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.139
So enough with the drama
and the tragedy.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.600
We've had enough
in this family. We've had enough.

12:04.683 --> 12:08.020
And the one spot of light
that there is,

12:08.103 --> 12:10.522
is that baby
asleep upstairs.

12:10.606 --> 12:13.525
That's your opportunity
to do something different.

12:13.609 --> 12:16.528
I want you to take the baby,
and I want you to leave this house,

12:16.612 --> 12:18.238
and I want you
to never come back.

12:18.614 --> 12:22.326
Your sister said she would
take care of him. She's a good mother.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.828
-No, I don't want that.
-What do you want?

12:24.912 --> 12:28.999
I want to...envision you
with that boy on your shoulders,

12:29.082 --> 12:31.001
walking down
Newbury Street.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.172
What about Violet?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.715
What about Violet?

12:38.717 --> 12:41.386
I'm a teenage girl.
Not exactly a cakewalk.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.849
Violet.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.852
What kind of father
have I been?

12:48.936 --> 12:51.230
You weren't eating.
You weren't going to school.

12:51.522 --> 12:54.900
You were already gone,
and I didn't get it.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.735
I shut you out.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.403
I was afraid
it would break you.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.656
I miss you so much.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.534
I was never
getting into Harvard.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.410
Oh...

13:05.494 --> 13:07.204
But I saved you
a shitload of money.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.705
Yeah, you did.

13:12.084 --> 13:13.669
You have to leave, Dad.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.712
Every minute
you're in this house,

13:15.796 --> 13:18.215
you're in danger,
and so is that baby.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.814
(softly) Please.
Do it for us.

13:50.998 --> 13:51.999
(baby fusses)

13:53.584 --> 13:55.043
(baby cooing)

14:00.674 --> 14:02.134
Where are you going, Ben?

14:02.551 --> 14:04.428
You didn't think
I'd just let you leave?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.097
Get out of my way, Hayden.
I don't have time for your bullshit.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.518
(groaning)

14:11.602 --> 14:13.061
Ah!

14:13.145 --> 14:15.439
-(crying)
-(shouting)

14:20.360 --> 14:21.403
(groaning)

14:21.486 --> 14:22.571
(screaming)

14:26.700 --> 14:28.827
(gagging)

14:33.415 --> 14:34.458
(gasps)

14:38.420 --> 14:40.672
-(gagging)
-(crying)

14:44.468 --> 14:46.678
Now we have all the time
in the world.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.765
(baby wailing)

14:57.814 --> 14:59.775
(doorbell rings)

15:03.695 --> 15:06.156
Welcome.
You must be the Ramoses.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.616
-Yes. I'm Stacy.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.034
-This is my husband, Miguel.
-Hi.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.411
Miguel.
What an exotic name.

15:11.495 --> 15:14.790
I must confess to a fascination
for all things south of the border.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.251
-Actually, my family's from Spain.
-Yeah.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.838
All the better.
I find European Hispanics vastly superior.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.590
This is a classic
LA Victorian,

15:23.674 --> 15:26.760
built in the 1920s
by a doctor to the stars.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.638
As you can see,
it's just fabulous.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.807
These are real
tiffany fixtures.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.642
-(wind whistling)
-Everything else in the house

15:33.725 --> 15:34.977
has been updated.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.812
Uh, Gabriel.
Hold on.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.648
Uh, I apologize
for my son.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.401
Apparently he's got the skateboard
surgically attached to his body.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.819
He doesn't go anywhere
without it.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.362
It's quite all right,
Mr. Ramos.

15:45.654 --> 15:48.240
As long as we don't leave
any marks on the floor.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.701
Are we waiting
for another sibling?

15:50.784 --> 15:53.287
No, we just have the one.
Thank you.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.790
The furnishing is from
the previous owner,

15:56.874 --> 15:58.917
but if you see
anything that you like,

15:59.001 --> 16:03.172
I'm sure the estate
is open to selling at the right price.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.716
(whispering)
This is amazing, babe.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.843
Look at this house.

16:08.218 --> 16:12.306
Um, speaking of money, Marcy,
I know the, uh, economy is down,

16:12.389 --> 16:15.184
but why is the asking price
so far below market?

16:15.267 --> 16:17.936
There isn't a problem
with mold or radon, is there?

16:18.020 --> 16:20.105
No. Nothing so simple.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.232
In the interest
of full disclosure,

16:22.316 --> 16:26.778
I must inform you that the previous
owners passed away in the house.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.906
-Oh.
-How?

16:29.448 --> 16:31.408
The wife died
during childbirth,

16:31.658 --> 16:34.953
and the husband,
in his grief, committed suicide.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.749
He hung himself
from the second-story balcony.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.503
It's a tragically
romantic love story.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.630
This is their dog, Hallie.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.758
She's the only remaining member
of the Harmon family.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.426
I've adopted her.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.429
Well, at least
they weren't murdered.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.183
-Mrs. Ramos.
-Yes?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.976
I'd be happy to show you
another house.

16:58.227 --> 17:01.522
But no matter where you go,
you'll be moving into somebody's history.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.690
Only this one can be had

17:03.774 --> 17:07.611
for $200,000 less
than the last time I sold it.

17:11.365 --> 17:12.783
What do you think, Gabe?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.493
I don't believe in ghosts.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.746
Of course he would
say that. (laughs)

17:17.829 --> 17:19.540
Should we continue
the tour?

17:20.207 --> 17:21.333
Yes. Sure.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.920
-I know you're going to love the kitchen.
-(inaudible)

17:25.003 --> 17:28.006
It's got marble countertops,
a breakfast nook,

17:28.090 --> 17:30.175
and have you ever seen
a pasta arm?

17:30.384 --> 17:31.385
BOTH: No.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.679
MARCY: Personally,
I haven't. I live alone.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.850
But Mrs. Harmon fancied herself
a bit of a gourmet.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.102
Notice the gazebo
in the backyard.

17:55.409 --> 17:56.743
(hinges creaking)

17:57.703 --> 17:59.204
(noisemakers popping)

17:59.454 --> 18:00.664
(grunts)

18:10.382 --> 18:12.259
-(popping)
-(laughing)

18:14.469 --> 18:16.180
(skateboard rolling)

18:19.975 --> 18:21.226
You okay?

18:23.562 --> 18:24.730
Yeah.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.818
I... I slipped.
Where... Where's Mom?

18:29.902 --> 18:32.821
Oh, the second she stepped
foot in the kitchen, it was game over.

18:32.905 --> 18:34.907
I think we just
bought ourselves a house.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.117
Come on. You gotta check out
the rest of this place.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.119
There's definitely room
for a pool table.

18:41.205 --> 18:45.334
MARCY: Imagine sipping
a nice mojito on a hot, sunny day.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.961
I guess you folks tolerate the heat
better than us <i>gringos.</i>

18:48.045 --> 18:49.421
Am I right?

19:03.143 --> 19:04.436
(sighs)

19:10.400 --> 19:13.153
I see you've got
a new family moving in next door.

19:13.237 --> 19:17.407
Yes, I noted that.
Oh, I do hope they're a nice family.

19:19.076 --> 19:22.412
I'd go over there
and welcome them personally,

19:22.496 --> 19:26.959
but as you may imagine, returning
to that house is difficult for me.

19:27.251 --> 19:28.961
After what I saw.

19:30.838 --> 19:33.674
You stupid son of a bitch.

19:38.303 --> 19:42.182
Please tell me that you're not here
with any more bad news.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.268
No real news, actually.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.436
So you still haven't found
that precious baby?

19:46.520 --> 19:49.314
-No trace.
-That's very worrying.

19:49.398 --> 19:51.233
We'd like to go over
your statement again.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.902
Just to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

19:53.986 --> 19:54.987
Of course.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.824
You said you'd gone over to the Harmons'
at approximately 7:30 p.m.,

19:58.907 --> 20:01.869
to check on Dr. Harmon
and his daughter.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.954
After ringing the bell
and getting no response,

20:04.037 --> 20:05.789
you decided
to enter the premises.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.251
Being no stranger
to tragedy,

20:09.334 --> 20:11.295
I was understandably
concerned.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.590
Prescient,
as it turned out.

20:14.673 --> 20:17.926
You stupid son of a bitch.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.804
I can't believe
she killed me.

20:20.888 --> 20:23.932
(chuckles)
Serves you right.

20:24.099 --> 20:27.102
My first instinct
was to flee,

20:27.186 --> 20:29.021
to run screaming
and never return.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.772
But then I thought
of the baby.

20:32.107 --> 20:33.275
Shit!

20:41.575 --> 20:42.910
Dad?

20:46.455 --> 20:48.081
Well, that's all very touching.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.084
But where the hell's the baby?

20:51.168 --> 20:55.047
So I went searching
for the Harmons' daughter.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.298
(flies buzzing)

20:56.381 --> 20:58.884
And when I discovered
that she was gone, too,

20:59.718 --> 21:01.720
I understood
what must have happened.

21:08.352 --> 21:10.103
Have you come
to see my baby?

21:11.063 --> 21:12.648
I've come to fetch
my grandson.

21:12.731 --> 21:13.982
Oh, you think so?

21:14.191 --> 21:16.777
Mrs. Harmon agrees with me.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.738
House of the dead
is no place to raise a child.

21:19.821 --> 21:23.325
-It is for this baby. He's special.
-He's mine.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.077
Over my dead body.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.787
(chuckles)
We're well past that.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.039
(groaning)

21:29.790 --> 21:30.958
Aw, shit.

21:35.420 --> 21:38.757
Violet took that child
and fled.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.635
God knows where.

21:41.718 --> 21:45.055
But I keep them both
in my prayers, every night.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.809
Well...

21:50.227 --> 21:51.311
(sighs)

21:54.273 --> 21:57.317
If you think of anything
Violet said to you

21:57.401 --> 22:01.446
that could, uh, indicate where she
might have gone, you will let us know?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.824
-Oh, without hesitation.
-Mmm-hmm.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.619
Thank you for your time.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.129
(door opens)

22:21.717 --> 22:23.677
Aww.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.846
Shh.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.557
Who's my good
little angel, huh?

22:29.308 --> 22:31.518
Who's my good little angel?

22:32.186 --> 22:33.937
Oh.

22:34.021 --> 22:37.858
Oh, there's my good little angel.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.318
Huh?

22:39.401 --> 22:41.361
(rock music playing)

22:44.406 --> 22:45.991
Who are you?

22:47.034 --> 22:49.119
You have awful taste
in music.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.288
Butthole Surfers?
(Scoffs)

22:51.788 --> 22:53.248
Hello?
Breaking and entering.

22:53.332 --> 22:56.251
-Who are you?
-A ghost of my former self.

22:57.628 --> 22:59.630
Violet.
I live in the neighborhood.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.383
Your hand's cold.

23:03.967 --> 23:06.470
You know what they say.
Cold hands, warm heart.

23:06.637 --> 23:07.638
(chuckles)

23:08.180 --> 23:09.223
Yo!

23:09.306 --> 23:12.434
Don't you have any Ramones?
Like <i>Animal Boy</i> or <i>Too Tough To Die?</i>

23:12.518 --> 23:13.852
Hey.
Get out of my room.

23:14.686 --> 23:17.022
You sure you want
to be alone?

23:17.105 --> 23:19.316
They say
this house is haunted.

23:20.776 --> 23:22.736
You're kind of twisted,
aren't you?

23:22.986 --> 23:24.530
You don't know
the half of it.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.156
No, you will not break

23:26.240 --> 23:29.368
I'm coming for you
Coming for you

23:38.919 --> 23:41.129
-Whoa.
-You okay?

23:41.213 --> 23:43.298
Yeah.
This floor is warped.

23:43.549 --> 23:46.510
You know who's warped?
That realtor, Marcy.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.512
You think?
I think she's hot.

23:49.221 --> 23:50.264
Red hot.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.724
-Smokin' hot.
-(laughs)

23:52.933 --> 23:54.268
-Really?
-Mmm.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.937
I may have to waste
that bitch then.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.314
Hey. There's enough
of me to go around.

23:59.398 --> 24:02.818
Well, I'm not into sharing.

24:04.236 --> 24:05.529
-Oh.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.948
Are we gonna christen
the house tonight?

24:09.366 --> 24:10.826
Hmm.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.455
Does this
answer your question?

24:16.164 --> 24:17.249
Mmm.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.126
This does.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.754
(laughing)

24:24.840 --> 24:27.509
Babe. Gabe's upstairs.

24:27.593 --> 24:29.219
Shh.

24:33.599 --> 24:34.975
(both grunting)

24:36.268 --> 24:39.146
I remember
when we were like that.

24:39.229 --> 24:40.856
In the beginning.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.151
Mmm.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.237
(door closes)

24:47.321 --> 24:48.405
(soft gasp)

24:48.488 --> 24:49.531
Oh.

24:51.033 --> 24:52.576
To be continued.

24:53.911 --> 24:55.412
Uh-huh.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.706
-On that note.
-Yes.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.043
Gabe's graduating this year.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.587
This house is so big.

25:03.921 --> 25:05.714
Do you think
we'll be lonely?

25:07.341 --> 25:08.884
A baby?

25:10.844 --> 25:13.096
-Don't you think I'm too old?
-Almost.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.432
-Aw.
-Almost. So we should get going.

25:21.146 --> 25:23.357
I lost two babies
in this house.

25:23.565 --> 25:26.026
One of them
never even took a breath,

25:26.109 --> 25:28.153
and Constance stole the other one.

25:28.237 --> 25:30.030
At least he's
out of this house.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.990
They seem like
such a nice couple.

25:32.533 --> 25:34.952
They can't have a baby
in this house.

25:35.327 --> 25:36.453
You're right.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.497
We have to do something.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.167
You're going to need help.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.296
Some spirits in the house
are angry and vengeful

25:46.713 --> 25:49.341
and eager to inflict
their fate on others.

25:49.424 --> 25:54.972
But many of us are innocent, kind,
blameless victims at the hands of another.

25:56.098 --> 25:58.767
And we <i>don't</i> want to see
more suffering in this house.

26:36.013 --> 26:37.764
(voice whispering)

26:41.852 --> 26:43.645
(whispering continues)

27:13.550 --> 27:15.552
TATE: What were you
dreaming about?

27:15.636 --> 27:17.763
-Shit!
-Bet I know.

27:20.474 --> 27:22.643
I'd dream about her, too,
if I could dream.

27:23.602 --> 27:25.312
I don't think
I do anymore.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.481
The hell?
Who are you?

27:28.065 --> 27:29.608
What are you doing
in my room?

27:29.691 --> 27:32.486
This used to be my room.
And then it was hers.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.446
What are you talking about?

27:35.906 --> 27:37.115
Violet.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.536
She was my girlfriend.

27:40.786 --> 27:42.579
The freaky chick
from before?

27:42.663 --> 27:44.456
What do you mean
by freaky?

27:44.540 --> 27:46.333
She seemed really cool.
Nothing happened.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.920
She didn't say
she had a boyfriend.

27:50.671 --> 27:52.005
We kind of broke up.

27:53.549 --> 27:54.883
Right.

27:55.843 --> 27:58.804
Well, I mean, it's totally
hands off, dude. I get it.

27:58.887 --> 28:02.349
No. I don't think you do.

28:07.145 --> 28:08.939
-(screams)
-Shit! Mom?

28:09.648 --> 28:10.691
(grunts)

28:11.900 --> 28:14.027
(screams)
Oh, my God!

28:14.111 --> 28:15.821
(clattering)

28:17.155 --> 28:18.866
Miguel! Miguel!

28:31.003 --> 28:32.963
Miguel! (sobbing)

28:33.046 --> 28:35.591
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.

28:36.425 --> 28:37.759
(sobbing)

28:38.051 --> 28:39.636
Get away from me!

28:40.512 --> 28:43.056
Get away from me!
(screaming)

28:43.557 --> 28:44.766
Get away!

28:44.850 --> 28:47.102
-TATE: No! You stay here!
-GABE: What do you want?

28:47.186 --> 28:49.104
(sobbing)

28:49.271 --> 28:51.356
Gabe! Gabe?

28:53.108 --> 28:54.818
-Gabe!
-Why?

28:55.068 --> 28:57.112
(screaming)

28:57.196 --> 28:59.156
-Why?
-No!

28:59.239 --> 29:00.449
(snarling)

29:01.408 --> 29:04.828
I want her to be happy.
She liked you, I could tell.

29:04.912 --> 29:06.580
-You're a good guy, right?
-What?

29:06.997 --> 29:10.000
I mean, you got all these friends
and you played some sports.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.169
-You make good grades, right?
-Average.

29:12.252 --> 29:15.380
Average is good.
Normal is good.

29:15.756 --> 29:17.049
She deserves normal.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.550
Get out of my way!

29:20.928 --> 29:22.471
I don't want to hurt you!

29:25.974 --> 29:28.268
Though I do have
to kill you.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.149
VIVIEN: Miguel.

29:35.359 --> 29:37.402
It's time for you
to open your eyes

29:37.486 --> 29:40.322
and see what this place is,
what it can do.

29:40.489 --> 29:43.242
I need someone
to feel my pain.

29:43.325 --> 29:45.661
-(crackling)
-(gasps)

29:47.704 --> 29:49.414
Let me lead you.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.805
-(sobbing)
-Look what he did to me.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.348
(screaming)

30:06.431 --> 30:07.599
(sobbing)

30:07.683 --> 30:09.142
Why are you doing this?

30:10.352 --> 30:14.231
Please. I told you, man.
Nothing happened!

30:21.196 --> 30:22.656
Could you maybe not look at me?

30:23.031 --> 30:24.032
What?

30:24.116 --> 30:27.035
I mean, could you...
Could you, like, stand up or...

30:27.494 --> 30:29.288
I don't know,
turn around or something?

30:29.371 --> 30:30.581
(coughs)

30:33.750 --> 30:36.962
Please. Don't kill me.

30:37.462 --> 30:39.298
Oh, it's nothing personal.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.383
It's just that
she's all alone.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.468
(sniffles)
And that's not right.

30:43.552 --> 30:45.220
Stand up!

30:45.304 --> 30:47.681
-<i>Padre nuestro...</i>
-Stop that. Stop that.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.391
-Come on.
-(speaking Spanish)

30:49.766 --> 30:50.893
Turn around.

30:52.561 --> 30:53.937
Naughty boy.

31:00.861 --> 31:02.404
What would Stacy think?

31:03.947 --> 31:05.824
Oh, God. I'm dreaming.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.210
You're wide awake.

31:16.877 --> 31:18.754
Oh, God!

31:19.046 --> 31:20.714
(screams)

31:23.008 --> 31:24.384
(sobbing)

31:25.093 --> 31:28.096
(screaming and sobbing)

31:28.180 --> 31:29.389
Oh, God!

31:29.765 --> 31:31.975
(screaming)

31:42.236 --> 31:43.487
Miguel!

31:43.904 --> 31:44.988
Stacy!

31:48.534 --> 31:49.660
Stacy?

31:49.743 --> 31:51.286
Miguel!

31:51.370 --> 31:53.121
Stacy!

31:53.205 --> 31:54.957
(shouting)

31:56.375 --> 31:57.876
-Leave her alone!
-(shouting)

31:57.960 --> 32:00.212
Ben, Ben! Ben!

32:01.129 --> 32:04.341
You sick, perverted bastard.
They're barely moved in.

32:04.424 --> 32:06.051
You're already preying
on the new meat?

32:06.176 --> 32:07.719
Who the hell
are you people?

32:08.345 --> 32:10.305
He used to be my husband.

32:12.015 --> 32:13.851
-(grunts)
-(screams)

32:14.226 --> 32:15.727
(Vivien laughing)

32:18.021 --> 32:20.732
You have no idea how long
I've been wanting to do that.

32:20.899 --> 32:22.276
(Stacy sobs)

32:22.359 --> 32:23.944
Ah!

32:24.027 --> 32:27.322
(straining) You have no idea
how long I've wanted to do <i>that.</i>

32:29.408 --> 32:31.910
(sobbing)

32:35.747 --> 32:36.957
(groans)

32:38.542 --> 32:40.127
This is what
it does to you.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.838
This house.

32:44.089 --> 32:45.465
Run.

32:46.550 --> 32:48.260
(whimpering)

32:50.053 --> 32:52.723
(both chuckling)

32:55.100 --> 32:58.187
Tate, no.
Put down the knife, Tate.

32:58.478 --> 33:01.690
I can't.
I'm doing this for you.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.484
(sniffles)
I couldn't save you.

33:04.985 --> 33:06.695
It's my fault you're alone.

33:06.778 --> 33:09.364
But I'm not alone.
My family's here now.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.450
It's not enough.
You need someone.

33:11.658 --> 33:12.868
Not him.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.161
Then what <i>do</i> you want?

33:15.204 --> 33:16.663
What I wanted was you.

33:26.256 --> 33:27.758
You told me to go away.

33:29.551 --> 33:30.802
Yeah.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.305
But I never said good-bye.

33:34.473 --> 33:36.558
Come let me say good-bye.

33:43.607 --> 33:45.526
(shuddering)

34:03.252 --> 34:05.170
Good-bye, Tate.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.056
(sniffles)

34:16.139 --> 34:17.474
(sobbing)

34:26.859 --> 34:29.319
-(honking)
-Gabe! Gabe, come on!

34:29.403 --> 34:31.196
<i>I know you belong</i>

34:31.280 --> 34:32.447
<i>To somebody new</i>

34:32.573 --> 34:33.574
Come on, Gabe!

34:35.659 --> 34:37.703
Come on, come on, come on!

34:37.786 --> 34:41.707
<i>You belong to me</i>

34:41.790 --> 34:43.292
(tires screeching)

34:43.375 --> 34:45.711
Some other poor family's
just gonna move in here.

34:45.794 --> 34:46.962
(tires squealing)

34:47.045 --> 34:48.839
<i>We're apart</i>

34:48.922 --> 34:52.009
<i>You're part of my heart</i>

34:52.092 --> 34:55.637
Suckers who will have no idea
what they're in for.

34:55.721 --> 34:58.724
And we know exactly what to do.

34:58.807 --> 35:02.895
<i>Just to little ol' me</i>

35:07.900 --> 35:10.527
(dramatic music playing
over speakers)

35:12.696 --> 35:16.116
Our tour concludes with
one of the most famous houses of horror

35:16.200 --> 35:17.618
in the City of Angels.

35:17.701 --> 35:21.413
And the recent and bloody tragedy
of the Harmon family...

35:21.496 --> 35:22.748
No. Nothing to see here.

35:22.831 --> 35:26.084
...only adds to the infamy
of the Murder House.

35:26.168 --> 35:27.586
I have to sell this house.

35:27.669 --> 35:30.422
Get out of here!
It's enough already!

35:30.547 --> 35:32.841
Now I have to sell
this house!

35:33.800 --> 35:35.302
TATE:
Have you got a minute?

35:37.095 --> 35:40.098
I know. I'm the last person
you want to see right now.

35:40.557 --> 35:44.144
You're not a person.
You're a monster.

35:44.478 --> 35:46.855
I really miss
our talks, Ben.

35:47.105 --> 35:48.398
They were really
helping me.

35:48.482 --> 35:50.526
(chuckles) Bullshit.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.736
You're a psychopath, Tate.

35:52.819 --> 35:55.197
It's a mental disorder,
and therapy can't cure it.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.449
So that's your diagnosis?
I'm a psychopath?

35:57.533 --> 35:58.867
Yep, and the worst kind.

35:58.951 --> 36:02.412
You're charismatic
and compelling and a pathological liar.

36:02.496 --> 36:04.039
But don't listen to me.
I'm a total fraud.

36:04.122 --> 36:07.167
And by the way,
therapy doesn't work.

36:07.376 --> 36:09.044
It doesn't work?
Then why do people do it?

36:09.294 --> 36:13.006
Because they don't want to take
any responsibility for their crappy lives.

36:13.590 --> 36:16.134
So they pay a therapist
to listen to their bullshit

36:16.218 --> 36:19.179
and make it all feel...special.

36:20.472 --> 36:22.099
So they can blame
their crazy mothers

36:22.182 --> 36:23.934
for everything
that went wrong.

36:24.685 --> 36:25.811
Sound familiar?

36:27.312 --> 36:29.439
(chuckles)
It's a great racket, too.

36:29.523 --> 36:32.484
Week after week,
month after month, year after year,

36:32.568 --> 36:35.779
we collect checks, but deep down,
we know it doesn't work.

36:36.738 --> 36:37.990
You son of a bitch.

36:38.699 --> 36:40.826
We're not so different, Tate.

36:43.453 --> 36:44.830
I'm a bad person, too.

36:45.873 --> 36:49.626
I hurt the people
I was supposed to love the most.

36:49.710 --> 36:51.753
But they forgave you, right?

36:51.837 --> 36:54.173
-Maybe Violet'll forgive me, too.
-She can't.

36:54.298 --> 36:57.885
You can only forgive someone
for what they've done to you <i>directly.</i>

36:59.720 --> 37:02.514
Those people you murdered?

37:02.681 --> 37:04.516
They're the only ones
who can forgive you,

37:05.100 --> 37:07.352
and you took away their chance.

37:08.312 --> 37:10.397
So this is it?

37:10.480 --> 37:13.567
There's no...
There's nothing I can do?

37:13.650 --> 37:15.235
No chance of mercy?

37:15.611 --> 37:17.154
(sobs)

37:20.908 --> 37:23.827
Terrific performance, Tate.

37:25.078 --> 37:27.748
The whole misunderstood kid act?

37:27.831 --> 37:30.876
Oh, I fell for it.
Violet did, too.

37:30.959 --> 37:35.839
But a psychopath,
by definition, is incapable of remorse.

37:35.923 --> 37:40.761
So, come on.
Let's try this again for <i>real</i> this time.

37:40.844 --> 37:42.554
You...

37:42.638 --> 37:47.434
...destroyed everything
that mattered most to me.

37:47.518 --> 37:50.729
What could you possibly
want from me now?

37:52.731 --> 37:54.399
I don't know
about definitions,

37:54.483 --> 37:56.818
but I really am sorry, Ben.

37:56.902 --> 37:59.071
-To you more than anyone.
-Sorrys are easy.

37:59.154 --> 38:02.157
What about taking responsibility
for the things you've done?

38:06.245 --> 38:07.829
Christ.

38:08.830 --> 38:10.666
You can't even say the words.

38:14.753 --> 38:16.463
In 1994,

38:18.215 --> 38:20.050
I set my mom's boyfriend on fire.

38:21.343 --> 38:24.763
And then I shot and killed
15 kids at Westfield High.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.558
I murdered the gay couple
who lived here before you.

38:29.685 --> 38:31.186
And I raped your wife.

38:32.563 --> 38:35.065
There were other things, too.
Other people I hurt.

38:36.024 --> 38:37.150
I'll tell you everything.

38:41.029 --> 38:42.406
I'm not your priest, Tate.

38:42.906 --> 38:45.367
I can't absolve you for any of this.

38:46.118 --> 38:48.745
Right. I get that.

38:49.872 --> 38:51.623
But can you just...

38:54.543 --> 38:56.044
...hang out with me sometimes?

38:57.254 --> 38:58.463
(sighs)

39:27.618 --> 39:29.786
(baby crying)

39:31.622 --> 39:33.790
-VIVIEN: Hello?
-(crying continues)

39:33.874 --> 39:34.875
Hello?

39:34.958 --> 39:36.835
NORA: Oh, thank God
you're here.

39:37.586 --> 39:41.256
I'm so exhausted.
You're the new nanny?

39:41.340 --> 39:42.591
Hello?

39:42.674 --> 39:44.927
(crying continues)

39:45.511 --> 39:47.554
-Nora?
-Mrs. Montgomery, please.

39:47.638 --> 39:48.680
Mother taught me that rule.

39:48.764 --> 39:51.767
Never allow the help to call you
by your first name, so...

39:52.476 --> 39:54.645
-Is that my baby?
-(crying)

39:58.690 --> 40:02.361
Uh, forgive me,
Mrs. Montgomery.

40:02.444 --> 40:04.571
I would have come sooner,
but I...

40:04.655 --> 40:06.949
I didn't think he made it.
I thought he was stillborn.

40:07.032 --> 40:12.120
Nearly. He made one tiny little cry
and then passed on.

40:12.204 --> 40:13.830
Apparently, I'm the only one
who witnessed it.

40:13.914 --> 40:15.666
Charles didn't. Genius.

40:15.749 --> 40:17.209
(crying)

40:18.502 --> 40:21.088
He's an unhappy child.
I'll tell you that.

40:23.799 --> 40:26.051
Oh, it's you.
The birth mother.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.970
Perhaps it was
your poor nutrition,

40:28.053 --> 40:29.888
or just your genetic inferiority.

40:29.972 --> 40:32.307
In any case,
I'm quite dissatisfied. He's a weakling.

40:32.391 --> 40:33.934
(crying)

40:34.017 --> 40:36.687
Well, his lungs are strong.
I could hear him upstairs.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.356
-May I?
-Oh, hands off.

40:39.731 --> 40:43.694
You people... You think you can just
show up and claim some sort of birthright,

40:43.777 --> 40:45.904
but arrangements
were made.

40:45.988 --> 40:47.322
This baby is mine.

40:48.073 --> 40:49.116
I understand.

40:50.993 --> 40:54.413
But I do know some...
Some tricks that might

40:55.706 --> 40:57.291
be helpful
to quiet him down.

40:57.374 --> 40:59.209
(crying continues)

41:01.211 --> 41:02.546
(sighs)

41:17.394 --> 41:20.564
-What do you call him?
-Little noisy monster.

41:20.647 --> 41:22.941
(shushing)

41:25.861 --> 41:29.239
Hush, little baby,
don't say a word

41:29.323 --> 41:33.994
-(crying stops)
-Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

41:34.912 --> 41:37.789
If that mockingbird don't sing

41:39.291 --> 41:43.212
Papa's gonna buy you
a diamond ring

41:45.088 --> 41:46.840
Oh, thank God.

41:48.258 --> 41:51.720
I was actually afraid I might harm him
if he didn't quiet down.

41:51.803 --> 41:55.265
He has been inconsolable
for days and days.

41:55.349 --> 41:57.309
I am so exhausted.

41:58.435 --> 42:01.271
Oh, dear. I think
I might need to...

42:03.482 --> 42:04.691
...take a rest.

42:07.027 --> 42:08.862
Perhaps you could keep him
for the night.

42:08.946 --> 42:10.697
You take a rest,
Mrs. Montgomery.

42:10.781 --> 42:12.324
You need a nice rest.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.618
We'll be fine.

42:26.672 --> 42:29.508
I'm not entirely sure I have
the patience to be a mother.

42:30.968 --> 42:33.387
Probably all of those
hideous nannies.

42:33.679 --> 42:36.849
Mother wasn't very good
at it either, truth be told.

42:42.229 --> 42:44.398
Are you gonna be a Nicholas?

42:44.940 --> 42:46.650
Or a Jonah?

42:48.360 --> 42:49.820
Or a Jeffrey?

42:51.989 --> 42:54.491
Are you gonna be
a little Jeffrey?

42:55.492 --> 42:58.078
Who are you gonna be,
little guy?

43:00.414 --> 43:01.665
Moira, what are you doing?

43:01.748 --> 43:04.126
Scouring the cabinets
with vinegar, Mrs. Harmon.

43:04.376 --> 43:07.796
I just noticed how sticky they were
when the new family moved out.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.299
I don't know
what else to do with myself.

43:10.382 --> 43:12.718
Cleaning is what I'm good at,
so I'll just carry on.

43:12.801 --> 43:14.595
Sorry, Moira.

43:14.678 --> 43:16.555
Look who I found.

43:17.514 --> 43:18.932
He was in the basement.

43:19.975 --> 43:21.727
He was down there with Nora,
wouldn't stop crying.

43:21.810 --> 43:24.062
I knew she
couldn't handle him.

43:24.146 --> 43:26.106
She doesn't really
want a baby.

43:26.190 --> 43:28.275
She just got stuck
on that idea.

43:28.358 --> 43:30.903
Not a motherly bone
in her body, that one.

43:31.904 --> 43:33.113
Do you want to hold him?

43:40.579 --> 43:42.331
(softly) Here you go.

43:46.543 --> 43:48.045
Mmm.

43:49.338 --> 43:51.006
He's such a frail little thing.

43:51.089 --> 43:53.217
His skin is like peaches.

43:53.717 --> 43:55.260
I would have made
a good mother

43:55.344 --> 43:57.429
if I hadn't been
such a little tramp.

43:58.639 --> 44:02.851
Forgive me. There's nothing worse
than a self-pitying old maid.

44:05.229 --> 44:08.815
You know, I'm gonna need
so much help with him.

44:08.899 --> 44:10.734
I can't accept such a position.

44:10.817 --> 44:12.361
I'm not trained
as a nanny.

44:12.444 --> 44:15.447
I wasn't thinking that you
would come work for us.

44:16.114 --> 44:19.326
I was gonna ask you
if you wanted to be his godmother.

44:20.661 --> 44:23.622
<i>Rum, rum, rum, rum</i>

44:23.705 --> 44:26.250
<i>Come they told me</i>

44:26.333 --> 44:28.043

feel safer.

44:28.126 --> 44:32.172
<i>-Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum</i>
<i>-Rum, rum, rum, rum</i>

44:32.256 --> 44:34.550

44:44.852 --> 44:47.855
-Wow. These ornaments are ancient.
<i>-Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum</i>

44:47.938 --> 44:50.065
-I suppose they are.
<i>-Rum, pum, rum</i>

44:50.148 --> 44:51.733
You'll come to understand,
Violet,

44:51.817 --> 44:53.902
that the word "ancient"
will lose all its meaning

44:53.986 --> 44:56.822
when your entire existence
is one long today.

44:56.905 --> 45:00.409
<i>-Rum-pum-rum-pum</i>
-BEN: Okay. Everybody ready?

45:00.492 --> 45:03.328
<i>Rum, rum, rum</i>

45:03.412 --> 45:05.455
Look at that.

45:05.539 --> 45:08.834
I chopped it down myself,
I'm proud to say.

45:10.794 --> 45:14.047
Have you ever seen anything
so beautiful?

45:15.007 --> 45:16.800
VIVIEN: I have.

45:17.718 --> 45:19.845
Look at him.
He's so amazing.

45:19.928 --> 45:22.055
-Oh...
-Best temperament.

45:22.139 --> 45:23.807
Hardly ever cries.

45:23.891 --> 45:25.225
Looks like his daddy.

Grow a pair, Rimbaud.

46:06.725 --> 46:08.268
She's not into you.

46:08.352 --> 46:10.312
You're not getting back
into her.

46:10.395 --> 46:12.356
She'll never talk
to you again.

46:13.023 --> 46:14.233
I'll wait.

46:15.817 --> 46:17.653
Forever, if I have to.

-(bells tinkle)

46:22.824 --> 46:24.785
Ding-dong. (laughing)

46:24.868 --> 46:28.205
How would you feel
about working a miracle today, Helen?

46:28.288 --> 46:31.375
Constance, you get your ass
in my chair.

46:31.458 --> 46:33.252
Oh, where you been, girl?

46:33.335 --> 46:35.420
I was starting to think
you found yourself another salon.

46:35.504 --> 46:38.257
Oh, heavens, no.
No, no, no.

46:38.340 --> 46:41.969
(chuckles) No, I've just been
a bit housebound of late.

46:42.052 --> 46:44.847
Now don't shriek
when this scarf comes off.

46:44.930 --> 46:49.476
Lady Clairol and I have
become entirely too familiar. (chuckles)

46:49.560 --> 46:52.062
-Housebound? You have an accident?
-No.

46:53.605 --> 46:55.148
I had a baby.

46:55.732 --> 46:56.775
A... A baby?

46:56.859 --> 46:57.860
A boy.

46:58.861 --> 47:00.487
A son. (laughs)

47:00.571 --> 47:04.116
Oh, I... No, I...
I didn't give birth to him, of course.

47:04.366 --> 47:10.080
No, he was the, um, child of distant
cousins on my mother's side.

47:10.163 --> 47:13.750
The Delongpres of Virginia.
Evaline and Steve.

47:13.834 --> 47:17.546
They died tragically
in a highway accident outside Richmond,

47:17.629 --> 47:19.882
leaving that poor
little angel an orphan.

47:19.965 --> 47:21.216
-Terrible.
-Yes.

47:21.300 --> 47:25.220
But little Michael and I
were meant to be together.

47:25.304 --> 47:27.097
He was meant to be my son.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.474
-And I, his mother.
-Oh!

47:30.058 --> 47:32.603
And I am sick of looking
like his grandmother.

47:32.686 --> 47:34.521
So, here.

47:34.605 --> 47:36.607
You work your magic.

47:40.819 --> 47:42.613
Oh! (laughs)

47:44.072 --> 47:46.158
Oh, Helen!

47:46.241 --> 47:48.202
Oh, you truly are an artist.

47:48.285 --> 47:51.455
Well, even an artist
needs the right materials.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.624
-Ohh.
-You know, Constance,

47:53.707 --> 47:55.334
in all the years I've known you,

47:55.417 --> 47:59.254
I don't think you have <i>ever</i>
looked younger or more radiant.

47:59.338 --> 48:01.757
It's true, isn't it?
(laughs)

48:01.840 --> 48:03.300
May I confide something?

48:03.550 --> 48:05.052
Yeah.

48:05.135 --> 48:08.222
Ever since I was a little girl,

48:08.305 --> 48:12.017
I knew I was destined
for great things.

48:12.643 --> 48:15.062
I was gonna be somebody.

48:15.145 --> 48:16.522
A person of...

48:18.023 --> 48:20.150
...significance.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.570
A star of the silver screen,
I once thought.

48:26.865 --> 48:28.200
But...

48:29.368 --> 48:32.204
...my dreams
became nightmares.

48:33.247 --> 48:35.207
Instead of laurels,

48:36.625 --> 48:38.585
funeral wreaths.

48:39.211 --> 48:42.214
Instead of glory...
(soft chuckle)

48:43.215 --> 48:45.467
...bitter disappointment.

48:46.051 --> 48:47.719
Cruel afflictions.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.556
Well, now I understand.

48:51.306 --> 48:55.310
Tragedy was preparing me...

48:56.436 --> 48:58.272
...for something greater.

49:02.359 --> 49:05.320
Every loss that came before
was a lesson.

49:06.405 --> 49:08.907
I was being prepared.

49:08.991 --> 49:11.034
(soft chuckle)

49:11.118 --> 49:12.828
And now I know for what.

49:16.790 --> 49:18.375
This child...

49:20.127 --> 49:22.963
A remarkable boy.

49:25.382 --> 49:27.384
Destined for greatness.

49:30.679 --> 49:33.765
In need of
a remarkable mother.

49:33.849 --> 49:36.977
Someone forged
in the fires of adversity...

49:39.646 --> 49:41.440
Who can guide him.

49:44.818 --> 49:46.695
With wisdom.

49:47.446 --> 49:48.906
With firmness.

49:52.534 --> 49:54.203
With love.

49:56.163 --> 50:00.000
I apologize for being
so late, Flora.

50:00.083 --> 50:02.711
But Helen had to go
into minute detail,

50:02.794 --> 50:06.131
every tiresome moment
of her niece's bat mitzvah.

50:06.215 --> 50:11.553
The amount of money those people
throw away on a 13-year-old is...

50:26.401 --> 50:27.486
Flora?

50:40.374 --> 50:42.042
(whispers) Oh, God.

50:55.556 --> 50:57.307
<i>(whistling a tune)</i>

50:59.726 --> 51:02.062
(laughing)

51:07.776 --> 51:09.778
-(softly) Ohh.
-(giggles)

51:12.114 --> 51:14.032
Now what am I gonna
do with you?

51:16.076 --> 51:18.161
<i>(whistling continues)</i>
