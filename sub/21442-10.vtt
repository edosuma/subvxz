00:07.841 --> 00:09.175
- What's up, guys?

00:09.242 --> 00:10.943
Welcome to another episode
of "The Dude Perfect Show."

00:11.010 --> 00:13.513
And today is a phenomenal day,
because it's demo day.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.614
- I love demo day!

00:14.681 --> 00:16.282
- I love demo day, too!

00:16.349 --> 00:18.418
Me and Gar are doing
a little office renovation.

00:18.485 --> 00:20.820
You know, in the old office,
we shared an office.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.522
The double office
was good for us.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.558
Unfortunately, now we have
a wall separating us.

00:25.625 --> 00:26.860
Some of you at home,

00:26.926 --> 00:28.361
you might be sharing a bedroom
with a sibling.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.096
And you might be
thinking to yourself,

00:30.163 --> 00:32.131
"I wish I could get
my own space."

00:32.198 --> 00:34.701
Don't think that.
- Yeah, terrible idea.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.403
- We tried it,
and it was not good.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.538
You don't separate
two incredible combinations.

00:38.605 --> 00:39.906
PB&amp;J.
- Yeah.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.408
- Salt and pepper.

00:41.474 --> 00:43.476
- Water and fish.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.645
- BOTH: [laughs]

00:45.712 --> 00:46.980
- Yeah, I guess that works.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.815
- You don't wanna
separate those two.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.949
- No, you don't.

00:50.016 --> 00:52.252
- That would be
a bad combination.

00:52.318 --> 00:53.820
But it's just more fun
to be together.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.821
- I agree.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.922
It's time to do some demo-ing.

Did you do the old knock test?

03:14.160 --> 03:16.029
- Are you kidding?
- The whole wall?

03:16.095 --> 03:18.565

at the hip.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.040

03:31.077 --> 03:32.812
- Sure.
- Yeah, I think so.

- Blow the whole wall down.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.762

putting the blame on?

05:31.564 --> 05:32.765
Not that we have any problems.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.101

15:55.287 --> 15:56.722
- This is Shadow, first of all.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.091
It looks more like
he falls forward

15:59.158 --> 16:01.260
instead of walks forward.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.162
I'd say we're gonna get last.

16:03.228 --> 16:04.330
Thanks.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.765
- Oh, dude, Guillermo
just took a pregame poo.

16:06.832 --> 16:07.900
- ALL: [laughing]

16:07.966 --> 16:09.001
- It's a good sign.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.736
- Dude, can I get
that out of there?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.338
- Nope.
- This is Guillermo.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.808
He has got shoulders
like a swimming buffalo.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.509
He already took a pregame poo,
which is good.

16:17.576 --> 16:18.811
Big fan of those.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.879
Let's do this.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.948
Gentlemen,
please place your hamsters

16:23.015 --> 16:24.116
at the starting line.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.884
Remember, top three finishers

16:25.951 --> 16:28.320
move on
to the human hamster ball race.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.789
You can yell, you can scream,
you can encourage.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.524
No physical contact.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.594
In three, two, one!

16:35.661 --> 16:36.862

No, no, no. Oh, no!

16:50.275 --> 16:51.944
That is such a hard design.

16:52.010 --> 16:55.080
- Dude, look at Samson.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.949
- Shadow, are you gonna start
moving? Are you kidding?

16:57.015 --> 16:58.984
- Mine just does not care
at all.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.786
He'd rather read a book.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.154
- Oh, here we go.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.455
- Guys, my guy's through!

17:03.522 --> 17:04.823
- No, no!

17:04.890 --> 17:07.092
You gotta get around that, dude.
Come here.

come on, come on!

17:18.670 --> 17:19.872

17:25.444 --> 17:27.980
- Guillermo,
I knew you could do it.

17:28.046 --> 17:29.481
- One-two finish.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.049
- One spot left, boys.
