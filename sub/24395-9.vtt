00:09.898 --> 00:12.498
<i>English,</i> for a girl who
wants to study in America.

00:12.538 --> 00:14.438
Hey, my English is as good as yours.

00:15.372 --> 00:16.650
Three weeks away,

00:16.652 --> 00:18.942
and I still don't have my dream dress.

00:20.045 --> 00:21.645
We discussed it,

00:21.647 --> 00:23.914
and because it's a
once-in-a-lifetime event...

00:23.916 --> 00:26.717
and only 'cause it's
a once-in-a-lifetime event...

00:26.719 --> 00:28.585
you may spend 500.

00:28.587 --> 00:32.356
And that's shoes and
everything else included.

00:32.357 --> 00:34.358
And no negotiation.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.027
Okay, but... What did I say

00:37.029 --> 00:38.695
about negotiation? But this night will

00:38.697 --> 00:40.596
literally go down in history.

00:41.118 --> 00:42.833
And we can afford it.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.001
Mom,

00:44.528 --> 00:46.492
you can pick five of those
“formative books”

00:46.494 --> 00:48.365
you want me to read. I'll have them done

00:48.367 --> 00:49.640
by my birthday for shoes separate.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.898
Okay,

00:52.900 --> 00:54.299
have it your way.

00:54.301 --> 00:56.335
Eight books, English,

00:56.337 --> 01:00.205
at my discretion,
for 500, shoes separate.

01:00.207 --> 01:01.306
Six.

01:04.278 --> 01:05.611
Ah, I have to...

01:05.613 --> 01:07.246
- Got to go.
- Got to go.

01:07.248 --> 01:08.580
Yep.

01:09.704 --> 01:11.904
Bye, Mommy.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

01:30.538 --> 01:32.171
Oh, sorry.

01:32.943 --> 01:33.897
_

01:33.922 --> 01:34.917
_

01:41.215 --> 01:42.815
Hello?

01:44.569 --> 01:46.569
_

01:58.263 --> 02:00.871
_

02:05.192 --> 02:08.044
_

02:08.044 --> 02:09.914
_

02:09.914 --> 02:11.822
_

02:11.822 --> 02:15.844
_

02:16.090 --> 02:18.664
_

02:20.021 --> 02:22.517
_

02:24.191 --> 02:26.077
Her airway's obstructed

02:26.079 --> 02:27.857
and her heart's racing
from the epinephrine.

02:27.859 --> 02:29.428
I'm a nurse.

02:36.604 --> 02:39.238
Help! Help, someone!

02:39.240 --> 02:40.973
Help!

02:52.415 --> 02:54.126
When's the last time
you were whisked away

02:54.128 --> 02:55.699
on a private jet by a client

02:55.701 --> 02:57.356
who wouldn't even give you their name?

02:57.358 --> 02:59.525
This is a first.

03:02.124 --> 03:04.296
Hello, we're here to see Daniel.

03:12.606 --> 03:14.039
Not much of a talker.

03:14.041 --> 03:15.841
Or the staff were told to keep quiet.

03:15.843 --> 03:16.842
Hmm.

03:16.844 --> 03:18.390
Hello.

03:18.913 --> 03:21.113
- I'm Daniel.
- Eric Beaumont.

03:21.115 --> 03:23.081
Zara Hallam and Oliver Yates.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.516
Right.

03:24.518 --> 03:27.719
I need your assurance this will
remain entirely confidential.

03:27.721 --> 03:29.021
Goes without saying.

03:29.401 --> 03:31.123
Please...

03:35.129 --> 03:36.295
Uh, earlier today,

03:36.297 --> 03:38.952
my daughter Abby was abducted.

03:40.067 --> 03:41.934
We received this.

03:43.637 --> 03:46.138
This is my daughter. The other woman is

03:46.140 --> 03:48.240
a bystander who tried to help.

03:48.242 --> 03:49.608
What does the message say, please?

03:49.610 --> 03:54.217
It says “Two million euros.
Wait for instructions.”

03:55.049 --> 03:57.449
I don't have access
to that kind of money.

03:59.954 --> 04:01.753
Not at the drop of a hat.

04:01.755 --> 04:04.756
My wife Lana does through a family trust.

04:06.063 --> 04:08.827
That explains the
cloak-and-dagger routine.

04:08.829 --> 04:11.029
Your wife is Lana Glas?

04:11.031 --> 04:13.966
Lana Glas, as in <i> Lana Glas?</i>

04:13.968 --> 04:16.468
As in soon to be
the first person of color

04:16.470 --> 04:18.237
elected prime minister
of the Netherlands.

04:18.238 --> 04:21.620
If the polls are right,
but there is a problem.

04:22.543 --> 04:24.476
Lana's made a public vow.

04:24.478 --> 04:27.946
She'll never negotiate
with terrorists or kidnappers.

04:55.511 --> 04:58.023
Can you negotiate
without my wife's consent?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.280
It's not a deal breaker,

04:59.282 --> 05:01.549
but we like to have both
parents on the same page.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.419
Well, I'm not sure that's possible.

05:04.421 --> 05:06.688
Are you not on good terms?

05:06.690 --> 05:08.823
We were, until today.

05:08.825 --> 05:11.859
Look, we both lost
our tempers this morning.

05:11.861 --> 05:15.163
I called her... things
I shouldn't have called her.

05:15.165 --> 05:16.898
The irony is, this is all wrapped up in

05:16.900 --> 05:18.433
what I love about Lana.

05:18.435 --> 05:20.401
She's married to her principles.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.569
This isn't about the election.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.037
She really believes that paying ransoms

05:23.039 --> 05:25.173
only encourages more kidnappings.

05:25.175 --> 05:27.075
Sounds like a formidable woman.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.309
Yeah, well, for the first time

05:28.311 --> 05:30.912
in our life together, I wish she wasn't.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.414
Does Lana know you've hired me?

05:33.416 --> 05:35.383
That's what started
our fight this morning.

05:35.385 --> 05:37.185
Hopefully, you'll be
more convincing than I was.

05:37.187 --> 05:39.053
Daniel, who's our guest?

05:39.055 --> 05:41.422
Eric Beaumont, private negotiator. Hi.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.925
Cynthia Walker,
Lana Glas' chief of staff.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.860
It would be best
if you left the building.

05:45.862 --> 05:47.929
I realize the optics are a concern.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.398
It would suggest that Lana's
willing to negotiate,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.233
- which is not true.
- Cynthia,

05:52.235 --> 05:53.401
are you really going to try to stop me

05:53.403 --> 05:55.036
from bringing my guest to see my wife?

05:55.038 --> 05:56.237
No.

05:56.239 --> 05:57.805
But let me put it this way...

05:57.807 --> 05:59.507
Lana's not going to negotiate.

05:59.509 --> 06:01.276
And your presence here is
putting Abby at risk

06:01.278 --> 06:02.977
by suggesting that she'll pay a ransom.

06:02.979 --> 06:04.312
She won't.

06:04.314 --> 06:06.581
Negotiation doesn't always mean
money changes hands.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.483
He's handled hundreds of negotiations.

06:08.485 --> 06:11.219
I have handled hundreds
of negotiations as well.

06:11.221 --> 06:13.488
With politics on the line, or lives?

06:13.490 --> 06:14.929
Ma'am, they're ready.

06:14.931 --> 06:16.039
For what?

06:16.064 --> 06:17.662
You're expecting contact
from the kidnappers?

06:17.664 --> 06:19.027
It's not your concern.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.062
I'm working for Abby's father,

06:21.064 --> 06:22.063
and his rights aren't diminished

06:22.065 --> 06:24.899
by Lana's position or yours.

06:24.901 --> 06:26.367
You strike me as someone smart enough

06:26.369 --> 06:27.535
to never turn down an asset.

06:27.537 --> 06:30.138
- I am an asset.
- They've called.

06:31.241 --> 06:34.169
You can come in. I do the talking.

06:34.678 --> 06:36.087
Thank you.

06:39.973 --> 06:45.030
_

06:45.288 --> 06:47.776
I want someone who speaks English.

06:47.778 --> 06:49.057
Who am I speaking with?

06:49.059 --> 06:50.490
Not your concern.

06:50.492 --> 06:52.460
I want to speak to Lana Glas.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.962
It would be best for you to consider that

06:54.964 --> 06:56.964
we have all the resources
of the government mobilized

06:56.966 --> 06:58.192
to find Abby.

06:58.194 --> 07:00.148
Think about what that means.

07:00.148 --> 07:02.615
Turning yourself in is your only option.

07:05.487 --> 07:07.620
He's making a video call.

07:12.928 --> 07:16.930
Putting Lana Glas on
the line is your only option.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.532
Oh, God.

07:20.469 --> 07:22.769
If you fire, you're
giving up your leverage.

07:22.771 --> 07:25.638
You've put too much effort into this.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.848
- Ten seconds.
- Cynthia.

07:29.344 --> 07:32.612
Offer him something.
Doesn't have to be money.

07:32.614 --> 07:35.615
I can offer you something
more valuable than money.

07:35.617 --> 07:37.317
I can promise you your freedom.

07:37.319 --> 07:41.721
If you release Abby now,
unharmed, we won't pursue you.

07:43.758 --> 07:45.558
Five seconds.

07:46.575 --> 07:48.194
You need to buy time.

07:48.196 --> 07:50.563
Tell him if they don't
hurt Abby, you'll speak to Lana.

07:50.565 --> 07:53.166
- You'll see what you can do.
- Right.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.201
I can make you an offer.

07:55.203 --> 07:57.570
Let me speak to Lana first.

08:04.342 --> 08:06.079
Speak to her.

08:06.081 --> 08:08.348
Then drop the money
in a place we'll tell you.

08:09.351 --> 08:12.018
You have 24 hours,
until 10:00 tomorrow night,

08:12.020 --> 08:13.686
or we pull the trigger.

08:21.329 --> 08:22.569
Hi.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.114
Of course.

08:28.136 --> 08:30.570
The minister would like
to speak with you.

08:32.662 --> 08:33.972
Thanks.

08:33.975 --> 08:36.308
If you, uh, think of anything else,

08:36.311 --> 08:38.376
feel free to give me a call.

08:39.014 --> 08:41.046
And feel better.

08:44.186 --> 08:46.386
Okay. Danke.

08:46.388 --> 08:48.655
So, the bodyguard's all torn up.

08:48.657 --> 08:50.690
Metrics say he's not involved. You?

08:50.692 --> 08:51.824
No luck.

08:51.826 --> 08:53.393
Apparently, when the Dutch
government seizes

08:53.395 --> 08:56.296
a store's CCTV, they don't share it.

08:56.298 --> 08:58.331
But I did find out a second ambulance

08:58.333 --> 09:00.500
arrived a few minutes after the first.

09:00.502 --> 09:01.935
Which means the first one was fake.

09:01.937 --> 09:03.169
Which takes planning.

09:03.171 --> 09:05.305
The bodyguard suggests
the guys in the ambulance

09:05.307 --> 09:06.839
were working for someone else.

09:06.841 --> 09:09.008
He also said the peanut allergy
wasn't widely known.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.109
But these kidnappers knew.

09:10.111 --> 09:11.177
Mm.

09:11.179 --> 09:13.613
Lana Glas is minister of foreign affairs.

09:13.615 --> 09:17.083
I'm guessing she's not
making a huge salary.

09:17.085 --> 09:18.618
How much is that family trust worth?

09:18.620 --> 09:20.653
Something like 50 million.

09:20.655 --> 09:24.857
So, why ask for two million
from a woman who's worth 50?

09:25.382 --> 09:27.967
I just need to see she is okay.

09:32.232 --> 09:33.299
Five minutes.

09:36.638 --> 09:38.104
You okay?

09:38.106 --> 09:41.841
I wouldn't go right to “okay,”
but I can breathe.

09:41.843 --> 09:43.490
You still sound a little wheezy.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.390
Can I...?

09:47.983 --> 09:49.781
I heard them.

09:50.252 --> 09:53.019
They want a ransom from your mom.

09:53.743 --> 09:55.567
She'll pay it, right?

09:55.569 --> 09:57.957
She'll get us both out of here?

10:00.595 --> 10:01.928
What's the matter?

10:01.930 --> 10:04.197
My mom's Lana Glas.

10:05.767 --> 10:08.901
Wow. I didn't realize.

10:08.903 --> 10:12.038
She's made promises
about not paying ransoms.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.773
And she believes it.

10:13.775 --> 10:15.275
She won't pay.

10:15.277 --> 10:17.010
But you're her kid.

10:17.012 --> 10:18.811
You don't know my mom.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.980
She's really that cold?

10:21.771 --> 10:23.116
It's not cold, it's just...

10:24.552 --> 10:27.920
...she has these crazy high principles.

10:28.653 --> 10:30.823
And she pushes herself hard.

10:30.825 --> 10:32.392
And me.

10:33.992 --> 10:35.728
I love her, but...

10:35.730 --> 10:38.598
Lana Glas' daughter
can't be average, right?

10:44.812 --> 10:46.812
_

10:47.512 --> 10:48.837
_

10:49.857 --> 10:51.857
_

10:52.194 --> 10:53.523
_

10:53.548 --> 10:56.316
This is Eric Beaumont.

10:56.318 --> 10:58.618
I'm sorry to meet
under these circumstances.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.086
Mr. Beaumont.

11:00.088 --> 11:02.889
I asked to see you for two reasons.

11:02.891 --> 11:04.857
One, to thank you
for helping on that call.

11:04.859 --> 11:06.292
And two,

11:06.294 --> 11:09.162
to tell you that we won't
be needing your services.

11:10.098 --> 11:11.417
Hear him out.

11:11.419 --> 11:12.565
Why don't I

11:12.567 --> 11:14.200
hear you out first?

11:15.426 --> 11:19.105
Do you remember the mass bombing
in Mogadishu in 1996?

11:19.107 --> 11:21.140
Killed 72 people, yeah.

11:21.142 --> 11:23.743
What you don't know is that
there was a kidnapping

11:23.745 --> 11:24.977
two months before.

11:24.979 --> 11:26.779
I advised my superiors

11:26.781 --> 11:29.315
not to pay ransom, but they did.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.684
The terrorists got their money

11:31.686 --> 11:34.320
but still executed three hostages.

11:34.322 --> 11:37.090
And they used that money
to fund the attack in Mogadishu.

11:37.092 --> 11:39.585
Do you know how often a ransom gets paid

11:39.587 --> 11:41.394
and the hostages die anyway?

11:41.396 --> 11:44.864
I know 81% of EU nationals taken
hostage by a terrorist are freed

11:44.866 --> 11:48.134
if their country has no policy
against paying ransoms.

11:48.136 --> 11:50.002
Which isn't the case in the Netherlands.

11:50.004 --> 11:52.038
Maybe you should change your policy.

11:58.813 --> 12:00.313
You think I'm heartless?

12:00.315 --> 12:03.383
Arguing statistics at a time like this?

12:03.385 --> 12:05.451
No, no.

12:05.453 --> 12:07.453
I would give my own life for my daughter.

12:07.455 --> 12:08.721
I don't doubt it.

12:08.723 --> 12:11.257
This morning I had to
ask my chief of staff

12:11.259 --> 12:13.712
to make sure
that I don't break down and pay.

12:13.714 --> 12:15.772
'Cause that's all I want to do.

12:15.774 --> 12:18.131
But I'm not abandoning Abby.

12:18.133 --> 12:20.433
I'm protecting lives in the future.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.210
- With a manhunt?
- Yes.

12:22.212 --> 12:24.036
With less than 24 hours
until they kill her?

12:24.038 --> 12:26.239
Every second she's out there,
her life is at risk.

12:26.241 --> 12:27.874
Your plan forces you
to wait for more information.

12:27.876 --> 12:29.342
I can act now.

12:29.344 --> 12:31.544
You have strong principles,

12:31.546 --> 12:33.946
and I respect that,
but this is a unique case.

12:33.948 --> 12:35.948
You've kept the story quiet.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.417
You can pay the ransom

12:37.419 --> 12:39.419
without encouraging any more kidnappings.

12:39.421 --> 12:41.786
If we're dealing with a terrorist group,

12:42.123 --> 12:44.290
two million is small change.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.835
How would it work?

12:55.837 --> 12:57.670
If I paid? If.

13:00.756 --> 13:04.534
_

13:07.715 --> 13:09.230
It's been leaked.

13:11.651 --> 13:12.985
Excuse me.

13:13.003 --> 13:16.164
_

13:16.189 --> 13:17.757
Was this you?

13:18.344 --> 13:20.326
The last thing I want
is the public aware.

13:20.328 --> 13:21.994
Now our hands are tied.

13:21.996 --> 13:25.064
Your boss told me that she asked
you to keep her from paying.

13:25.066 --> 13:27.431
I think we both know
that leaking that video

13:27.433 --> 13:29.302
would make it a lot harder
for her to pay.

13:29.304 --> 13:31.237
You're right about one thing.

13:31.239 --> 13:33.573
There's no way Lana's gonna pay now.

13:41.793 --> 13:43.554
This is crazy.

13:43.588 --> 13:45.355
“Watch what will happen
if we elect a woman.

13:45.357 --> 13:46.589
Bitch will cave”"

13:46.591 --> 13:47.724
“If that woman doesn't pay,

13:47.726 --> 13:49.192
she's a heartless robot”"

13:49.194 --> 13:50.453
I guess you've seen the video.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.196
I analyzed the wave form
from the kidnapper's call.

13:53.198 --> 13:55.532
There's no latency, no hesitation.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.701
He's cool, he's calm, I don't
think he'd hesitate to kill.

13:57.703 --> 13:58.868
That's a problem.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.303
Lana's approach is a manhunt.

14:00.305 --> 14:01.738
- Guns blazing?
- Mm-hmm.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.640
Well, that won't provoke any violence.

14:03.642 --> 14:06.209
So I take it we're
working for Daniel alone?

14:06.211 --> 14:07.711
Yeah, Lana won't even see me now.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.879
She's refusing to consider the ransom.

14:09.881 --> 14:11.047
What's our next move?

14:11.049 --> 14:13.383
We need to find out who broke the story.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.416
Now, there's a woman, Cynthia Walker,

14:15.418 --> 14:17.987
Lana's chief of staff,
she may have leaked it.

14:17.989 --> 14:20.135
I need to know if I can trust her.

14:20.137 --> 14:21.511
Okay, I'm on it.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.064
I need to make contact
with the kidnappers.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.903
Excuse me, do you speak English?

14:33.905 --> 14:34.904
Yes.

14:34.906 --> 14:36.239
All right, can you broadcast live?

14:36.241 --> 14:37.986
- Yes, we can.
- Great.

14:38.744 --> 14:41.044
My name is Eric Beaumont,
I'm a private negotiator

14:41.046 --> 14:43.243
working for Abby's father Daniel de Haan.

14:43.245 --> 14:45.715
Now, I have a message for the kidnappers.

14:45.717 --> 14:48.746
I can get you your money,
but first we need to speak.

14:49.121 --> 14:52.696
Call the number on my website,
CrisisResolutionWeb.com.

14:52.698 --> 14:54.460
I'll be waiting.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.021
Abby.

14:59.838 --> 15:01.671
Can you hear me?

15:01.696 --> 15:03.396
I'm here.

15:03.886 --> 15:05.769
Me, too.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.571
You hanging in?

15:08.573 --> 15:11.274
Just scared.

15:13.229 --> 15:16.379
I keep thinking we could escape.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.786
These locks are like the ones
in my old house.

15:23.656 --> 15:28.124
I can work on it, but you're not
well enough to run.

15:28.126 --> 15:30.163
Well, I can try.

15:30.913 --> 15:34.876
Or, if you got away,

15:35.367 --> 15:37.086
and I didn't...

15:37.111 --> 15:39.088
I would come back for you.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.399
Could you give my mom a message?

15:44.594 --> 15:47.143
Tell her that I don't blame her,

15:47.597 --> 15:50.558
and that I was going to make her proud.

15:51.082 --> 15:56.319
And that I love her and my dad, too.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.835
Okay.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.269
Better give me a minute.

16:13.271 --> 16:14.749
Mm-hmm.

16:17.627 --> 16:19.142
You think you're pretty smart.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.643
I never wanted the press involved.

16:20.645 --> 16:22.579
This is me making lemonade.

16:22.581 --> 16:23.816
You realize it will look like Lana

16:23.818 --> 16:25.089
was on board with that offer?

16:25.091 --> 16:27.283
I chose my words to avoid that, but yes,

16:27.285 --> 16:29.085
some people will assume.

16:29.087 --> 16:31.329
You have no idea of the resources

16:31.331 --> 16:32.755
we have working on this.

16:32.757 --> 16:34.924
We cannot have these surprises.

16:34.926 --> 16:36.101
For Abby's sake,

16:36.103 --> 16:37.627
I need you to keep me in the loop.

16:37.629 --> 16:38.962
Hey, I will if you will.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.297
That is not my call.
Some of it's classified.

16:41.299 --> 16:44.601
See, that's the nice thing about
being a private negotiator.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.569
I don't have to deal with red tape.

16:46.571 --> 16:49.172
I can focus on the innocent
15-year-old kid.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.675
I have known that 15-year-old kid

16:52.677 --> 16:54.344
since she was four feet tall.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.545
You want to cause problems?

16:55.547 --> 16:57.280
Apparently, I can't stop you.

16:57.282 --> 17:00.984
But you do not get to question
my dedication to that kid.

17:02.053 --> 17:04.587
I do need to know what you're planning.

17:05.757 --> 17:07.457
I will share what I can.

17:07.459 --> 17:09.157
Then, so will I.

17:11.601 --> 17:13.329
- All right, then.
- Thank you.

17:13.330 --> 17:14.724
You're welcome.

17:19.971 --> 17:23.439
So, the V.E.B. is gonna route calls

17:23.441 --> 17:25.375
to our phone and take messages.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.277
I wish we had Max here
to lighten the load.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.245
We are gonna get a lot of scammers.

17:29.247 --> 17:33.883
Yeah. Anyway, we have been
researching the other victim.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.551
Tess Mason... she's Canadian

17:35.553 --> 17:37.720
but works as an ER nurse in Amsterdam,

17:37.722 --> 17:40.089
so at least we know
she can handle the pressure.

17:40.091 --> 17:42.358
What about the peanut allergy?

17:42.360 --> 17:44.861
Daniel told us Abby's cell
phone was found at the scene.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.596
No fingerprints, so the guy
was probably wearing gloves,

17:46.598 --> 17:48.431
but they did confirm that
there was peanut oil

17:48.433 --> 17:50.433
- found on the phone.
- And Daniel also made

17:50.435 --> 17:52.001
a list of all family and friends

17:52.003 --> 17:54.637
who are aware of Abby's
severe peanut allergy.

17:54.639 --> 17:56.406
We've reached out to her doctors.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.018
Where are we on who leaked
the kidnapping video?

17:59.020 --> 18:01.344
Four major news outlets posted the video

18:01.346 --> 18:03.246
at almost the same time.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.348
But there was also an obscure news site.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.784
Now I'm thinking,
why choose all the top dogs

18:07.786 --> 18:09.740
and throw in one site no one's heard of?

18:09.742 --> 18:12.146
Yeah. Good thought. Worth looking into.

18:12.146 --> 18:13.979
I'm waiting to hear back.

18:13.981 --> 18:15.413
We also checked out Cynthia.

18:15.415 --> 18:16.648
Mm, she's impressive.

18:16.650 --> 18:18.216
A litigator that got into politics.

18:18.218 --> 18:20.552
International trade and cooperation.

18:20.554 --> 18:22.788
A whole other kind of negotiator.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.647
She's been active on everything

18:24.649 --> 18:26.958
from Brexit, the EU, UN, NATO...

18:26.960 --> 18:30.996
And pretty much every other
acronym you can think of.

18:30.998 --> 18:32.631
Can we speak?

18:32.633 --> 18:35.167
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

18:39.039 --> 18:40.438
Uh...

18:40.440 --> 18:42.374
I can probably get close
to half a million.

18:42.376 --> 18:43.675
Is that enough?

18:43.677 --> 18:45.942
I'll do my best to make it work.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.515
I appreciate it's difficult
to make this choice

18:50.517 --> 18:52.284
in opposition to your wife.

18:52.286 --> 18:54.920
If you're not sure about this,
I can give you time.

18:54.922 --> 18:58.537
But when the kidnappers call,
we need to move fast.

19:01.261 --> 19:03.042
Tell me what happens next.

19:03.302 --> 19:06.671
_

19:15.108 --> 19:17.709
You warned Beaumont about interfering.

19:18.221 --> 19:19.277
Yes.

19:19.279 --> 19:21.813
He said he would keep us
in the loop on his plans.

19:23.884 --> 19:25.606
How are you doing?

19:26.816 --> 19:29.120
Just thinking about Daniel.

19:29.122 --> 19:32.624
When he gets stressed, he forgets to eat.

19:34.323 --> 19:37.329
The man can multiply four
digit numbers in his head,

19:37.331 --> 19:39.965
but half the time he
leaves without his keys.

19:41.068 --> 19:43.568
You <i> will</i> be around to remind him.

19:43.570 --> 19:45.570
And once Abby's home, it won't matter

19:45.572 --> 19:47.420
how it happened.

19:50.544 --> 19:53.778
Do you trust Beaumont to keep his word?

19:54.385 --> 19:56.982
Uh... I can't be certain.

19:56.984 --> 19:59.348
We need to do better than that.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.454
I'll take care of it.

20:09.263 --> 20:11.129
Hello?

20:15.002 --> 20:16.368
This poor girl's been kidnapped,

20:16.370 --> 20:20.202
and we're getting... prank calls.

20:21.275 --> 20:23.080
How are you?

20:24.785 --> 20:26.785
- How am I?
- Yeah.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.185
Seriously, how are you?

20:29.766 --> 20:31.330
I've been so busy with the baby

20:31.355 --> 20:33.694
we haven't has the chance
to talk since Max left..

20:34.191 --> 20:36.688
Well don't need to hurt a heart?

20:39.055 --> 20:40.625
I've been talking to her.

20:41.182 --> 20:42.904
- Makes one of us.
- I know.

20:42.906 --> 20:44.596
And I called Max on it.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.097
You deserve more

20:46.099 --> 20:49.023
than a sudden breakup and
a dash to the airport.

20:50.566 --> 20:52.103
For what it's worth,

20:52.105 --> 20:55.040
she thought a clean break would be easier

20:55.042 --> 20:56.608
for both of you.

20:56.610 --> 20:58.643
How's she doing?

20:58.645 --> 21:01.535
With, you know, the shooting
and everything?

21:03.329 --> 21:05.539
She's working her way through it.

21:06.019 --> 21:07.819
- Come here!
- No!

21:07.821 --> 21:09.168
- Yeah!
- Ow!

21:09.170 --> 21:10.822
Try to escape?

21:10.824 --> 21:12.157
No, I... please, I promise.

21:12.159 --> 21:14.225
- Ow!
- This is what happens.

21:14.227 --> 21:15.760
I won't try it again.

21:19.099 --> 21:20.498
I promise I won't try it again,
I promise.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.034
- I promise! No, no!
- Come here.

21:25.138 --> 21:27.405
Come here.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.748
Crisis Resolution.

21:37.321 --> 21:38.817
We have Abby.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.585
Prove it.

21:45.859 --> 21:47.692
Eric.

21:48.895 --> 21:50.709
Kidnapper.

21:52.733 --> 21:54.699
This is Eric Beaumont.

21:54.701 --> 21:57.102
I want to thank you for sending
another picture of Abby.

21:57.104 --> 21:59.404
You said you can get what we want.

22:01.808 --> 22:04.509
It's not possible for me to
get you two million euros,

22:04.511 --> 22:07.393
but I can offer you 400,000.

22:08.248 --> 22:09.781
Every second you delay
increases the chance

22:09.783 --> 22:11.916
that they will find you.

22:11.918 --> 22:14.219
Bring the money
to the Ruisdael Treinstation.

22:14.221 --> 22:16.554
You have three hours.

22:18.362 --> 22:20.025
Thank you.

22:22.095 --> 22:24.963
Two million to 400,000 just like that?

22:24.965 --> 22:27.532
I'd file it under cause for concern.

22:27.534 --> 22:28.600
Mm-hmm.

22:32.506 --> 22:33.838
What's up?

22:34.311 --> 22:36.541
Have you cleared Cynthia
of the news leak?

22:36.543 --> 22:38.209
No, I'm still working on it.

22:38.211 --> 22:40.512
Are you going to tell her about this?

22:41.886 --> 22:43.220
Yeah.

22:44.117 --> 22:46.518
All right, sit tight.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.720
The comms are up.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.642
I've got the vehicle.

23:03.236 --> 23:05.103
Everything okay?

23:07.407 --> 23:09.274
Something's not right.

23:17.217 --> 23:19.751
Eric!

23:19.753 --> 23:21.619
- Are you Beaumont?
- Eric!

23:21.621 --> 23:23.088
Sir, are you Beaumont?

23:23.090 --> 23:25.323
Respond, sir. Are you Beaumont?

23:25.325 --> 23:27.292
I-I can't hear you!

23:27.294 --> 23:28.560
It's Beaumont.

23:28.562 --> 23:30.128
Do you have any idea what you just did?

23:30.130 --> 23:31.329
My job.

23:31.331 --> 23:33.731
You just blew our chance to save Abby.

23:33.733 --> 23:35.633
We got one.

23:37.785 --> 23:39.204
Okay. Move.

23:39.206 --> 23:41.195
It's okay, you're safe.

23:42.903 --> 23:46.344
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.
- Where's Abby?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.681
They brought me to see if it was a trap.

23:49.683 --> 23:52.117
The ransom's now ten million euros.

23:52.119 --> 23:55.520
They said you have three hours
before they kill Abby.

23:55.522 --> 23:56.888
And until then...

23:56.890 --> 23:58.289
Until then what?

23:58.291 --> 24:01.392
They're going to break
her fingers one by one.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.330
We're all set.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.427
<i>We saw an opportunity</i>

24:19.429 --> 24:21.395
- to use our considerable resources.
- What does that mean?

24:21.397 --> 24:23.030
You saw an opportunity
to do things your way

24:23.032 --> 24:25.032
and you obliterated
the kidnappers' trust.

24:25.034 --> 24:26.110
- Trust?
- Yes.

24:26.112 --> 24:27.445
You want to talk about trust?

24:27.447 --> 24:29.496
You told me that you would
share information,

24:29.498 --> 24:30.571
then you went behind my back.

24:30.596 --> 24:31.706
Okay, sure, you made the same promise

24:31.708 --> 24:33.574
and then you tapped our phones.

24:33.576 --> 24:35.509
Well, clearly we had good reason.

24:35.511 --> 24:37.878
Go ahead, take it. Why not?

24:37.880 --> 24:39.128
Cynthia Walker.

24:40.150 --> 24:42.506
Oh, who cares about the poll numbers now?

24:44.526 --> 24:46.487
Look, I know you're worried

24:46.489 --> 24:47.786
about what they might do to Abby.

24:47.786 --> 24:49.054
So am I.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.025
By all accounts,
you're a great negotiator.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.660
Your approach must serve you well

24:56.662 --> 24:59.229
when negotiating within
an established framework,

24:59.231 --> 25:01.431
in a position of power,
exchanging favors.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.699
It's not as simple as that.

25:02.701 --> 25:07.370
Still, I take a more... nuanced approach.

25:07.372 --> 25:09.372
I work with a profiler.

25:09.374 --> 25:13.162
We focus on emotions,
impressions, states of mind.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.414
So, why the pitch? What do you want?

25:17.791 --> 25:19.918
We need to speak to the nurse.

25:20.993 --> 25:22.893
She might know more than she realizes.

25:24.555 --> 25:27.457
Mm. Well, we don't know
what she's been through

25:27.459 --> 25:29.011
with the kidnappers.

25:29.728 --> 25:31.695
I think there's an argument
for letting her face a woman

25:31.697 --> 25:33.682
instead of two men.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.373
So you're looking for information

25:43.375 --> 25:45.142
about the Glas story?

25:45.144 --> 25:48.378
No offense, but you're not
exactly <i> The New York Times.</i>

25:48.380 --> 25:50.747
Who leaked the story and why to you?

25:50.749 --> 25:52.215
It was an anonymous e-mail.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.050
As for why me, 20 years ago,

25:54.052 --> 25:57.320
I got a tip about a family
sailing around the world

25:57.322 --> 25:59.322
that was kidnapped by Somalian pirates.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.424
A Dutch family?

26:02.544 --> 26:04.895
My stories were getting
massive attention.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.842
Then I learned that the
Dutch ambassador to Somalia

26:07.844 --> 26:10.133
refused to pay ransom.

26:10.135 --> 26:11.768
Lana Glas.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.403
What happened to the family?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.682
The story ruined my career.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.508
I've got too many bills to pay.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.627
Uh... here.

26:37.629 --> 26:39.829
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

26:40.457 --> 26:42.376
The family was murdered.

26:43.377 --> 26:46.102
And suddenly my editors
decided not to publish anything

26:46.104 --> 26:48.838
unless my source went on the record.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.340
Who pressured them?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.631
Draw your own conclusions.

26:51.633 --> 26:55.931
All I know is, I pushed back
and my editors blacklisted me.

26:56.890 --> 27:00.894
Till this day on, people ask me
what happened to that story.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.620
A cover-up?

27:03.622 --> 27:04.768
It smells that way.

27:04.770 --> 27:06.990
It may not have even occurred to Lana

27:06.992 --> 27:08.289
that it could be connected.

27:08.291 --> 27:11.061
And 20 years in politics
makes for a lot of enemies.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.662
Oh, this was never about money,

27:12.664 --> 27:14.698
but now it looks more personal
than political.

27:14.700 --> 27:15.999
We should track down

27:16.001 --> 27:17.534
the relatives of the family who died.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.692
I'm on it.

27:18.694 --> 27:21.290
Actually, I need you for something else.

27:29.915 --> 27:32.549
Did you talk to Tess?

27:32.551 --> 27:35.685
Yeah. Her story's pretty brutal.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.854
We'd still like to talk to her.

27:37.856 --> 27:41.258
We've got information to trade
if it'll help you get us access.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.368
What information?

27:42.370 --> 27:43.496
We believe the kidnapping

27:43.498 --> 27:45.338
has a personal connection to Lana.

27:45.340 --> 27:46.678
This is Oliver Yates, our profiler.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.688
I noticed walking over here,
your body language suggests

27:49.690 --> 27:51.380
you're trying to make a tough decision.

27:51.382 --> 27:52.458
You're struggling,

27:52.460 --> 27:54.371
but you're open to every word I say.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.405
You want help.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.241
Hmm. He's good.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.243
But you had me at “information to trade.”

28:00.245 --> 28:01.266
I'll make a call.

28:01.268 --> 28:04.281
Can you give me one more minute?

28:07.052 --> 28:08.685
Look, that thing Oliver
said that you looked

28:08.687 --> 28:09.929
like you were trying to make a decision,

28:09.931 --> 28:13.091
I'm wondering if that might
be about what to do next.

28:13.792 --> 28:15.525
I don't know, maybe it's getting harder

28:15.527 --> 28:17.294
to blindly follow that promise
you made to your boss.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.429
- I don't do things blindly.
- Bad choice of words.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.232
What I'm trying to say is, if you think

28:22.234 --> 28:24.334
that Lana should pay the ransom,

28:24.336 --> 28:26.688
don't let that promise get in your way.

28:27.572 --> 28:29.691
Lana trusts you.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.777
Maybe you owe it to her
to trust yourself.

28:43.085 --> 28:44.582
Tess, if it's okay with you,

28:44.584 --> 28:46.137
I'd like to ask you some questions.

28:46.139 --> 28:48.736
Can you tell us anything
about who was in charge?

28:48.738 --> 28:50.160
He was a big guy.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.895
Six-foot-five, I think.

28:51.897 --> 28:56.166
Maybe 200 pounds.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.934
A shaved head and a,

28:57.936 --> 28:59.969
a scar on his neck.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.015
What was his motivation?

29:02.941 --> 29:05.942
Personal? Political? Financial?

29:05.944 --> 29:07.479
Just...

29:09.214 --> 29:11.181
hatred.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.722
Make her mom pay.

29:21.660 --> 29:24.127
Abby's such a sweet kid.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.456
They started hurting her.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.200
I can still hear her screaming.

29:31.384 --> 29:33.384
_

29:34.444 --> 29:36.444
_

29:36.789 --> 29:38.789
_

29:39.569 --> 29:41.569
_

29:50.822 --> 29:53.289
Did you hear them refer
to each other by name?

29:53.291 --> 29:54.924
No.

29:54.926 --> 29:57.106
They never use each other's names.

29:57.896 --> 30:01.398
Look, all I know

30:01.400 --> 30:06.169
is they were sick, sexist, racist...

30:06.171 --> 30:09.139
That's the basis of their hatred?

30:09.499 --> 30:11.443
They said stuff I don't want to repeat.

30:11.445 --> 30:13.410
Yeah, I understand the impulse,

30:13.412 --> 30:14.944
but we need to know

30:14.946 --> 30:16.798
what they said.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.595
I'll paraphrase.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.765
They called her...

30:25.424 --> 30:26.600
bitch.

30:28.226 --> 30:29.959
Psycho ambassador.

30:31.021 --> 30:32.814
They said “ambassador”?

30:33.982 --> 30:35.665
Is that a bad thing?

30:35.667 --> 30:38.635
No. No, it's-it's telling.

30:39.112 --> 30:42.449
Lana Glas hasn't been
an ambassador in 20 years.

31:01.693 --> 31:05.895
I promised not to let you make
this choice out of emotion.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.334
If you pay to get Abby back,

31:11.336 --> 31:14.564
you will have to question the
choices you've made in the past.

31:15.273 --> 31:18.208
You'll have to think about
all those people who died

31:18.210 --> 31:19.642
when you didn't pay.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.613
How can I live with that?

31:23.615 --> 31:25.949
Letting people...

31:25.951 --> 31:27.984
even children... die...

31:27.986 --> 31:29.886
and then, deciding to...

31:29.888 --> 31:32.755
To save the only life
that's in danger right now.

31:32.757 --> 31:34.251
I don't know.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.360
I really don't know
how you'll live with it,

31:37.362 --> 31:39.362
but I do know that...

31:39.364 --> 31:42.532
that the weight of that guilt
is not worth Abby's life.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.534
Lana.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.139
Abby's blood on your hands...

31:47.806 --> 31:49.672
you won't come back from that.

31:49.674 --> 31:50.976
Yeah.

31:56.948 --> 31:59.282
Yeah, okay.

31:59.284 --> 32:01.361
Call the bank.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.959
<i>Something's off about the nurse.</i>

32:09.961 --> 32:12.629
- What's your read?
- Well, her nerves were off the charts.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.664
I'd expect more relief.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.065
Could be survivor's guilt, right?

32:16.067 --> 32:17.500
Every time we mentioned Lana's name,

32:17.502 --> 32:19.369
there was a spike in her stress level.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.570
There could be resentment

32:20.572 --> 32:22.138
because she refused to pay the ransom.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.306
Seems good.

32:23.308 --> 32:24.974
- How's the nurse?
- Resting.

32:24.976 --> 32:26.142
You find out anything?

32:26.144 --> 32:27.710
The Dutch family
that was killed 20 years ago

32:27.712 --> 32:30.647
only had a few relatives,
and those have died.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.982
So it's probably not revenge.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.285
That doesn't make sense.
I could maybe write it off

32:35.287 --> 32:36.786
if it was just a leak to the journalist,

32:36.788 --> 32:38.221
but Tess said the kidnappers

32:38.223 --> 32:40.156
- referred to Lana as an ambassador.
- Which was her role

32:40.158 --> 32:42.767
when she refused to pay
and got that family killed.

32:42.769 --> 32:44.060
We're missing something.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.728
The connection to the
past screams revenge.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.404
You said they died at sea.

32:47.406 --> 32:48.831
Yes.

32:48.833 --> 32:51.668
Were their bodies ever recovered?

32:51.670 --> 32:53.703
I don't know.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.050
You're thinking...

32:55.052 --> 32:56.773
Well, if it screams revenge,

32:56.775 --> 32:58.841
could there have been a survivor?

33:06.818 --> 33:10.019
The nurse told me you wanted to see me,

33:10.021 --> 33:12.822
and I wanted to thank you.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.958
I don't want your gratitude.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.527
There were parents
and, what, children... how many?

33:17.529 --> 33:19.462
Mother, father, twin girls.

33:19.464 --> 33:21.097
- How old?
- Four.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.276
Four years old, 20 years ago.

33:25.195 --> 33:28.071
A nurse might find a way to
access private medical records.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.340
Find out about a peanut allergy.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.009
You should know
I've decided to pay the ransom

33:33.011 --> 33:36.646
and, you know, bring her back home.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.042
They told me to give you a message.

33:40.502 --> 33:43.586
They'll kill her if I don't
take you to her alone.

33:45.790 --> 33:49.025
They said one word to your
security, and she's dead.

33:49.803 --> 33:51.995
Do you even know where to go?

33:55.058 --> 33:56.966
I know everything.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.504
They have instructions to kill
her if they don't hear from <i> me.</i>

34:01.506 --> 34:02.774
You?

34:04.709 --> 34:06.309
Lose your security.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.179
Don't move! Hey, whoa!

34:12.181 --> 34:16.288
_

34:16.313 --> 34:18.313
_

34:18.871 --> 34:20.077
_

34:20.077 --> 34:22.077
_

34:23.360 --> 34:25.161
Wait, wait, what-what'd he say?

34:27.860 --> 34:29.098
They're gone.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.501
Was this all an assassination plot?

34:31.503 --> 34:33.302
No, she would've done that here.

34:33.304 --> 34:37.141
Tess wants Lana to watch Abby die.

34:44.911 --> 34:46.443
Cynthia.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.346
We're not doing this dance again.

34:48.348 --> 34:50.181
- We have protocols.
- Yeah, tactical protocols,

34:50.183 --> 34:53.518
which means bullets could fly
around Lana and possibly Abby.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.985
We were starting to work well together.

34:54.987 --> 34:56.187
Let's compromise.

34:56.188 --> 34:58.122
Your way and mine.

34:58.124 --> 34:59.791
- Meaning?
- I'm sure you have some way

34:59.793 --> 35:01.225
of tracking Lana: GPS, I'm guessing,

35:01.227 --> 35:02.474
implanted or otherwise.

35:02.476 --> 35:03.904
- I can't...
- Confirm or deny, I know.

35:03.929 --> 35:05.863
But when you track her down,

35:05.865 --> 35:08.298
let me have five minutes to do what I do.

35:08.735 --> 35:10.168
If I can't get to a peaceful solution,

35:10.170 --> 35:13.004
you can deploy
your considerable resources.

35:13.006 --> 35:15.139
I'll talk to our people.

35:15.141 --> 35:17.341
But I'll be there with you.

35:23.416 --> 35:25.344
- Abby.
- Mama!

35:25.344 --> 35:27.734
_

35:30.457 --> 35:32.517
What are you doing?

35:32.518 --> 35:35.352
20 years ago your mom
let my family be murdered

35:35.354 --> 35:37.154
because she wouldn't pay a ransom.

35:38.545 --> 35:41.066
But Abby had nothing to do with this.

35:41.068 --> 35:43.126
Do you know what my earliest memory is?

35:45.431 --> 35:49.333
My father's brain splattering
across a porthole.

35:49.839 --> 35:51.802
You have no idea how sorry I am.

35:53.439 --> 35:55.472
Keep me, let her go.

35:55.474 --> 35:57.407
You're missing the point.

35:57.409 --> 35:58.775
- You're a spectator here.
- Wait.

35:58.777 --> 36:00.143
Wait, wait.

36:00.145 --> 36:02.546
She deserves to know why.

36:06.982 --> 36:08.982
_

36:25.917 --> 36:27.971
Do you want to know what it feels like

36:27.973 --> 36:29.539
to see your family murdered?

36:29.541 --> 36:31.007
Watch.

36:31.009 --> 36:32.382
Tess.

36:32.698 --> 36:36.146
Nobody should have to know
what that feels like.

36:36.148 --> 36:38.382
May I ask you a question, Tess?

36:38.384 --> 36:40.751
You think it's gonna feel good
to pull that trigger?

36:40.753 --> 36:42.355
You think I can't do it?

36:42.357 --> 36:43.920
That's not what I asked.

36:43.922 --> 36:46.123
What if I told you that what
happened to your family

36:46.125 --> 36:50.193
was an impossible choice and
that Lana was devastated?

36:50.195 --> 36:52.729
I'd say too little, too late.

36:52.731 --> 36:54.798
- Wait, wait, please, please.
- Shut up.

36:54.800 --> 36:58.402
- You're a hypocrite.
- Yes, she paid,

36:58.404 --> 37:01.335
but that was after 36 hours
of you twisting the knife.

37:01.337 --> 37:05.921
I know something about
difficult childhoods.

37:05.923 --> 37:09.513
When I was nine, my mom was depressed

37:09.515 --> 37:11.982
and they put me in foster care.

37:11.984 --> 37:14.017
Then my mom killed herself.

37:15.091 --> 37:17.841
I lost everything.

37:17.843 --> 37:19.523
I am so sorry.

37:20.055 --> 37:21.158
Tess,

37:22.140 --> 37:25.061
you will spend the rest of your life

37:25.063 --> 37:26.797
trying to deal with it.

37:28.371 --> 37:29.704
You can decide.

37:30.607 --> 37:34.142
You get to choose not to hurt anyone.

37:34.144 --> 37:36.244
That's in your hands.

37:36.246 --> 37:39.365
If you go public with your past,

37:39.983 --> 37:41.616
it can make world leaders think twice

37:41.618 --> 37:44.552
about their ransom policies,
but nobody is going to listen

37:44.554 --> 37:48.523
to a vengeful woman
who killed an innocent teenager.

37:55.165 --> 37:56.598
Okay.

37:59.335 --> 38:01.054
Okay.

38:02.205 --> 38:04.038
Okay.

38:04.947 --> 38:06.476
_

38:08.044 --> 38:10.438
You did the right thing.

38:19.576 --> 38:21.689
Hey, let's get you out of this place.

38:21.691 --> 38:23.024
Come.

38:23.026 --> 38:24.459
Come, baby, come.

38:24.461 --> 38:25.787
Up.

38:30.066 --> 38:31.358
Thank you.

38:40.677 --> 38:42.777
What?

38:42.779 --> 38:44.639
Oh, I was just thinking.

38:46.182 --> 38:48.182
Wondering...

38:48.184 --> 38:50.687
if that story you told was true.

38:53.089 --> 38:54.899
True enough.

39:44.808 --> 39:46.674
Okay.

39:46.676 --> 39:48.494
I got to let you go.

39:51.381 --> 39:52.947
LET ME GUESS:

39:52.949 --> 39:55.668
you negotiated your way past security.

39:56.586 --> 39:58.920
I had Lana make a call.

39:59.881 --> 40:02.023
I owe you an apology

40:02.025 --> 40:04.192
for accusing you of leaking that video.

40:04.881 --> 40:08.306
I realized later
that Tess released it herself.

40:09.432 --> 40:11.966
You just come from seeing Lana?

40:11.968 --> 40:13.734
I am, yeah.

40:13.736 --> 40:16.904
She and her family are doing
as well as can be expected.

40:16.906 --> 40:20.007
Good. Did she say anything about me?

40:20.860 --> 40:22.476
What do you mean?

40:24.314 --> 40:25.990
I'm leaving.

40:26.683 --> 40:28.549
It's time to move on.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.118
You know, I-I hate to leave Lana,

40:31.120 --> 40:33.988
but you know, the polls look good.

40:34.374 --> 40:36.657
She's gonna be fine,

40:36.659 --> 40:38.392
and she understands.

40:39.003 --> 40:41.756
Talking to Tess made me realize that

40:42.232 --> 40:46.133
I just... I need to do more
than argue policy.

40:46.135 --> 40:47.368
Hmm.

40:47.370 --> 40:48.502
What?

40:48.846 --> 40:50.137
What's with the look?

40:50.139 --> 40:51.339
Oh, it's just funny

40:51.341 --> 40:53.674
how the stars align, sometimes.

40:53.676 --> 40:55.142
What do you mean?

40:55.144 --> 40:58.564
I came here to offer you
more than an apology.

40:59.482 --> 41:01.315
You offering me a job?

41:01.901 --> 41:03.885
I might be.

41:04.988 --> 41:06.520
I don't come cheap.

41:08.074 --> 41:10.024
Let's negotiate.

41:11.189 --> 41:13.227
Starting with your office space.

41:14.397 --> 41:16.898
Get used to something smaller, okay?

41:16.900 --> 41:18.266
It's gonna be hard.
