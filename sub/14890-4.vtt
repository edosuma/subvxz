You almost had a very expensive
lawsuit on your hands.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.664
I‐I’m sorry, Mr. Gorpley.
I‐I’m just a little excited.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.266
I just bought a racehorse!

01:43.770 --> 01:46.807

No, that’s the beauty of it.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.848
Oh, I get it. It’s stuffed.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.552
No, the reason it is so cheap is

01:58.585 --> 01:59.720
because the guy
who sold it to me

01:59.753 --> 02:01.387
is going through a messy divorce

02:01.421 --> 02:02.823
and he’s got to liquidate
all his assets

02:02.856 --> 02:04.758

get her hands on anything.

Cousin, how was your
afternoon at the races?

03:07.621 --> 03:09.255
Oh! Oh!

03:09.289 --> 03:12.358
Balki.
Balki, it was a great day.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.260
I bought a horse.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.796
Get out of the city!

03:15.829 --> 03:17.397
Yeah, it was fate, Balki.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.999
It was fate. It was meant to be.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.868
The horse’s name
is Larry’s Fortune.

03:23.403 --> 03:27.373
Well, cousin, you own a horse.
Congratulations.

03:27.407 --> 03:28.875
Well, I‐I don’t exactly
own him yet.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.244
See, I gave the guy
half the money

03:31.277 --> 03:32.813
and unless I give the other half
I lose the first half.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.847
So what do you say, buddy?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.516
I’d say you’re talking
pretty fast, cousin.

03:37.618 --> 03:41.655
How would you like to be the
co‐owner of Larry’s Fortune?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.694
Oh, cousin, I would love
to own a horse again.

03:47.728 --> 03:51.364
I‐I had a horse on Mypos.
His name was Trotski.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.501
Oh, I raised him
from when he was just a baby.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.403
He could plow 40 acres
in half a day.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.840
That Trotski
could work like a horse.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.643
And still he had the energy
left over for fun.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.578
One day, I, uh, I started giving

04:04.611 --> 04:06.780
rides to the little
children on his back.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.049
‐My back was out that day...
‐Yeah, Balki, Balki...

04:09.082 --> 04:11.484
Balki, buddy, buddy, baby.

04:11.518 --> 04:12.986
Why don’t we talk about
your horse another time?

04:13.019 --> 04:15.388
Let’s talk about our horse!

04:15.421 --> 04:16.923
Are you in?

04:16.957 --> 04:19.392
Well, you know,
I, I try to be kind of fresh

04:19.425 --> 04:20.661
kind of happenin’, kind of in.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.565
No, I mean, are you with me?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.633
Well, of course I’m with you.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.569
No, I mean, you’re gonna
buy the damn horse?

04:30.036 --> 04:31.337
‐Yeah.
‐You are?

04:31.371 --> 04:32.906
‐Sure.
‐Good!

04:32.939 --> 04:35.776
And now, cousin, all we have to
do is buy a field and a plow

04:35.809 --> 04:37.611
so that the horse
will have something to do.

04:37.644 --> 04:38.579
You know what they say

04:38.612 --> 04:40.814
"Idle hooves
are the devil’s playground."

04:43.584 --> 04:46.386
No, no, no, Balki, uh,
this is not a farm animal.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.888
This is a racehorse.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.890
One of the fastest
creatures on Earth.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.758
We are going to race him!

04:51.792 --> 04:53.493
[laughs]

04:53.527 --> 04:55.061
Cousin, give me
a line of credit.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.600
We could never run
faster than a horse!

Larry, there’s something
that’s been bothering me.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.095
What is it, kitten?

05:33.433 --> 05:35.401
Well, do you think
it was a good idea

05:35.435 --> 05:37.470
to use our honeymoon money
to buy this horse?

05:39.706 --> 05:43.043
Kitten, kitten, kitten...

Fortune wins this race...

...we’ll be able to go
anywhere you want.

discussed it with me first.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.523
And, Larry...

05:58.091 --> 05:59.125
...don’t call me kitten.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.962
You’re right.

Cousin Larry, we don’t have
a thing to worry about.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.152
Cousin Larry’s Fortune
is ready for the race.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.556
He was a little nervous at
first, but he calmed right down

06:29.590 --> 06:31.057
when I sang
"Danke Schoen" to him.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.760
And, cousin,
you’re not going to believe this

06:33.794 --> 06:36.597
but the man riding him
is even shorter than you!

06:47.574 --> 06:49.976
Oh, Balki, he’s beautiful.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.878
I combed his mane myself.

06:51.912 --> 06:57.017
I tried giving him a ponytail,
but it seemed redundant.

’Oh, cousin,
look how handsome he is.’

hard like all the other horses.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.132
Well, he’s 50 lengths behind!

Come on, Harris Ranch!
That’s it! Come on!

Well, gee, I guess I’ll just go
collect my, uh, winnings.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.086
It’s really a shame
they wouldn’t let me bet

08:06.119 --> 08:08.054
on the horse
that was gonna finish last.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.189
I had that right too.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.963
I’ve gotta go.
I got lucky too.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.199
‐Did you pick a winner?
‐I sure did!

08:20.567 --> 08:21.635
And that’s him
right over there.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.040
I don’t believe it.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.809
I could have run
faster than that.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.277
I don’t think so.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.280
At least not
with a man on your back.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.688
I lost.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.625
Well, it was a lot easier
to see Larry’s Fortune

08:44.658 --> 08:46.593
without all those other
horses around him.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.696
I lost!

08:49.730 --> 08:51.297
I guess this is a bad
time to tell you

08:51.331 --> 08:52.999
where I was hoping to go
on our honeymoon.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.237
I lost big.

There you are,
Cousin Larry’s Fortune.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.158
Is this what you’ve
been waiting for?

09:18.191 --> 09:24.030
I was so proud of you today!
You were so polite in that race.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.633
You didn’t push and shove
your way ahead of the others.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.836
What is wrong with you?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.738
Couldn’t you have picked up
the pace just a little bit?

09:31.772 --> 09:32.973
I mean,
they had to delay the start

09:33.006 --> 09:36.009
of the next race because of you.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.245
Cousin, you are really hung up
on this winning/losing thing.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.716
Can’t you just experience
the totality

09:42.749 --> 09:44.250

This could be a
whole new career for him!

Do you do impressions?

09:55.929 --> 09:56.997
I’m Dr. Tierney.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.337
I’m Dr. Tierney.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.739
You should hear him do you.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.276
Balki, it wasn’t the horse.
It was the doctor talking.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.745
Are you the owners
of this horse?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.979
Yes, I’m Larry Appleton.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.649
And this is my co‐owner,
Balki Bartokomous.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.187
I’m the track veterinarian.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.389
You know, I don’t eat
a whole lot of red meat myself.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.794
Not vegetarian.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.932
Oh! Ha!

10:31.965 --> 10:34.000
I’m sorry. Which war?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.773
Horse doctor!
He’s a horse doctor!

10:41.207 --> 10:43.343
I just finished
examining your horse

10:43.376 --> 10:45.245
and I’m afraid
we got a problem here.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.113
It appears he’s suffering
from Wright’s Syndrome.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.850
Wright’s Syndrome? What’s that?

10:49.883 --> 10:51.317
It’s a lung disorder.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.921
And I’m sorry to say
it has no known cure.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.923
I’m afraid the only thing
you can do is put him to sleep.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.027

in the morning.

what’s all the yelling about?

doing in our apartment?

Oh, cousin, please, please,
please!

12:20.373 --> 12:21.808
It’s the only way
I can cure him.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.410
Cousin, just say yes!

12:24.444 --> 12:27.347
Balki, you heard Dr. Tierney,
there is no cure.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.315
Cousin, he said,
"No known cure."

12:29.349 --> 12:32.252
I just want to use
an old remedy we use in Mypos.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.354
It works on sheep,
and you can use what’s left over

12:34.387 --> 12:35.889
to weatherproof your henhouse.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.761
Can you believe they’re getting
8.95 a pound for Yak tail?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.165
Balki,
the horse can’t stay here.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.802
Cousin, all I need is 48 hours
to see if the cure will work.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.837
Balki, he’s a horse.

12:50.871 --> 12:54.140
You don’t keep a horse
in an apartment.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.441
How can I possibly
lose this argument?

12:56.943 --> 12:59.179
Okay, okay, fine, cousin.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.515
You want to tell the horse,
you tell him yourself.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.883
Come here,
Cousin Larry’s Fortune.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.385
Now...

13:05.418 --> 13:08.054
You look this gifted horse
in the mouth

13:08.088 --> 13:09.956
and tell him
there’s no room at the inn.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.324
Come on,
give Cousin Larry a kiss.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.358
Give him a kiss.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.165
Alright, you can keep
Larry’s Fortune

13:19.199 --> 13:21.434
in the apartment,
but just for 48 hours!

13:21.467 --> 13:23.236
Thank you, cousin.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.972
I don’t understand how I could
have lost this argument.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.942
[instrumental music]

13:34.280 --> 13:37.417
So, this is it.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.853
You’re just going to sit there
not taking your medicine.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.592
I worked my fingers to the bone,
chopping and grating

13:45.626 --> 13:47.160
not to mention pureeing.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.463
And this is the thanks I get?

13:50.496 --> 13:52.533
I want you to know you’re
putting a knife in my heart.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.369
Alright, come on,
Cousin Larry’s Fortune

13:56.402 --> 13:58.071
just, just try it.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.140
I ground the buzzard bones
extra fine.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.309
Come on. Come on.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.979
Cousin Larry,
I need your help again.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.550
Balki, I did it twice yesterday
and once this morning.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.518
Please, don’t make me
do it again.

14:11.552 --> 14:13.186
Do you want Cousin Larry’s
Fortune to get better?

14:13.219 --> 14:14.287
Yes.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.256
Well, then,
you have to do your part.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.224
And don’t kink the straw
like you did last time.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.094
Don’t push me, Balki.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.264
Mm...

14:27.167 --> 14:28.535
Mm...

14:28.569 --> 14:30.403
Good medicine.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.638
[slurping]

14:31.672 --> 14:33.406
O‐oh! Can I have all of this?

14:34.608 --> 14:35.642
No, Cousin Larry.

14:35.676 --> 14:38.178
You have to share with
Cousin Larry’s Fortune.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.248
No. No. No. No. No. No.

14:42.282 --> 14:47.053
Well, okay,
if I have to, I have to.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.457
Good boy.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.659
[slurping]

14:54.561 --> 14:55.996
Oh, good boy.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.331
Oh, that’s a good horsey.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.233
You’ll be trotting
around in no time.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.635
[knock on door]

15:01.668 --> 15:03.169
Oh, here, take this.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.410
Oh, hi, Mary Anne. Hi, Jennifer.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.477
Hi, Fortune.

15:11.512 --> 15:13.046
‐Oh!
‐We baked you a carrot cake.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.384
Does he like carrot cake, Balki?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.988
Does he like carrot cake?
Does a chicken have hips?

15:25.559 --> 15:27.728
I even planted carrots
in the window box.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.495
They should be up by spring.

15:29.530 --> 15:31.331
Look what else
we brought you, Fortune?

15:31.364 --> 15:32.365
I’ll get the plates.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.138
O‐oh! Wow!

15:38.171 --> 15:41.374
Look at that!
Aren’t you a lucky horse?

15:41.407 --> 15:43.677
And the red really brings out
the highlights in your mane.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.280
We thought that would
come in handy this winter.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.282
You know how drafty
it gets in here.

15:49.315 --> 15:50.517
‐’Yeah.’
‐’Carrots in the spring?’

15:50.551 --> 15:51.685
A blanket for the winter?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.720
H‐have you people
lost your minds?

15:53.754 --> 15:55.255
Am I the only one
who sees a problem

15:55.288 --> 15:56.590
with having a horse
in the apartment?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.024
Calm down, Larry.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.193
We’re just trying to make
Fortune feel better.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.095
Yeah, cousin, he’s having
a much better day today

16:02.128 --> 16:03.496
than he did yesterday.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.498
I think it was that
bubble bath we gave him.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.236
Well,
maybe he is getting better.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.538
He does seem to have
a little more color.

16:11.572 --> 16:13.473
Mm‐hmm. Oh, no, no, no.

16:13.507 --> 16:14.708
Before you get dessert

16:14.741 --> 16:17.343
you’re going to have to have
a little more Mypos therapy.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.579
(Larry)
Oh, no, no.

16:28.522 --> 16:31.257
Okay, cousin.
You know what to do.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.526
Yeah, yeah.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.560
Mmm. Mm.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.529
Oh.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.563
Yeah.

16:38.632 --> 16:40.500
Mm‐mm, good medicine.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.268
Mm...

16:42.302 --> 16:44.505
[coughs]

16:47.508 --> 16:50.443
[instrumental music]

16:52.813 --> 16:56.249
Balki.
It’s almost time for "Mr. Ed."

16:56.282 --> 16:58.218
I’ll get the popcorn.
You get the...

17:02.623 --> 17:04.790
[instrumental music]

17:04.825 --> 17:06.492
Is he taking a little nap?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.730
Cousin, we have to talk.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.242
Cousin, I’m afraid
Cousin Larry’s Fortune

17:23.276 --> 17:25.612
has taken a turn for the worse.

17:25.646 --> 17:27.748
He’s been lying down
all morning.

17:27.781 --> 17:30.283
’If the medicine,
was going to work’

17:30.316 --> 17:31.752
he’d be on his feet by now.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.688
W‐w‐well, we’ll give
him more medicine.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.157
I think he was really starting
to like the buzzard bones.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.560
Uh, I know I was.

17:39.593 --> 17:41.628
‐Well, well, here, here.
‐Cousin, Cousin Larry...

17:41.662 --> 17:44.097
Here, Fortune. Come on.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.266
Come on. Here. Here.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.634
Look, good... Here.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.138
‐Cousin, cousin, excuse me.
‐Good medicine. Good medicine.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.740
What are you doing?

17:53.774 --> 17:55.441
Just taking off the parsley.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.311
Taking off the parsley.
Are you out of your mind?

17:58.344 --> 17:59.613
Balki, I don’t like parsley.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.683
And Fortune won’t miss
the decorative touch.

18:02.716 --> 18:04.585
Cousin,
it’s not a decorative touch.

18:04.618 --> 18:07.253
It’s the secret
power ingredient.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.489
It flushes toxins
out of the pancreas

18:09.523 --> 18:11.357
and freshens the breath.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.662
Balki, I’ve taken off
the parsley every time.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.465
‐Parsley!
‐Parsley.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.785
‐Nothing’s happening.
‐Just a minute. Just a minute.

18:38.819 --> 18:41.187
It’s gliding down
his elementary canal...

18:41.221 --> 18:42.322
It’s, it’s...

18:42.355 --> 18:45.526
It’s energizing his lungs,
freshening his breath.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.361
It’s shimmying
through his stomach.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.663
And it should be
hitting his pancreas...

18:51.297 --> 18:52.298
...now!

19:00.273 --> 19:02.909
[instrumental music]

19:02.943 --> 19:05.478
I guess, I guess we,
we waited a little too long.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.219
Sorry, buddy.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.536
Cousin Larry’s Fortune.
You’re cured! You’re cured!

19:29.570 --> 19:30.604
Cousin, we did it!

19:30.637 --> 19:32.739
We did it! We saved him!

19:32.773 --> 19:34.575
Balki, you did it.

19:34.608 --> 19:35.809
I can’t share the credit.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.211
Why not, cousin?
You shared the medicine?

19:38.845 --> 19:41.782
[instrumental music]

19:43.550 --> 19:46.252
[indistinct announcement]

19:46.286 --> 19:47.821
I think it’s very nice
that the new owners

19:47.854 --> 19:50.557
are going to race
Larry’s Fortune again.

19:50.591 --> 19:53.326
Well, it’s nice,
but it’s, uh, not very smart.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.329
Fortune’s new owners, uh,
gave me $2000 for a horse

19:56.362 --> 19:58.632
that’s the longest shot
in the race. Look at that.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.201
Fortune’s going off
at ninety‐nine to one.

20:02.503 --> 20:04.571
Larry, it’s a lot more fun
coming to track with you

20:04.605 --> 20:05.706
when you’re calm.

20:05.739 --> 20:08.575
And when our honeymoon’s
not at stake.

20:08.609 --> 20:12.946
Hey, I’m just here to spend
a nice afternoon at the races.

20:12.979 --> 20:16.316
(male announcer)
’Horses and riders board
the fifth race at the gates.’

20:17.818 --> 20:19.686
’Now they’re walking
into the start gate.’

20:23.790 --> 20:26.326
I can’t wait to see Cousin
Larry’s Fortune run again.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.629
We just saw him in the paddock.
He looked really frisky.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.797
Well, that’s one of the
side effects of the cure.

20:35.769 --> 20:38.605
‐Side effects?
‐Beg pardon?

20:38.639 --> 20:40.674
Side effects of the cure?

20:40.707 --> 20:43.043
Oh yeah, the cure
sure makes them frisky.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.646
Puts a beautiful shine
on their coats

20:45.679 --> 20:47.748
makes them run like the wind...

20:47.781 --> 20:49.349
Sometimes it gives
them the hiccups.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.551
What was that?

20:50.584 --> 20:52.352
Don’t worry, cousin, you just

20:52.385 --> 20:54.788
make them breathe in to a paper
bag, and the hiccups go away.

20:54.821 --> 20:58.959
No, I mean, w‐w‐what was that
run‐like‐the‐wind thing?

20:58.992 --> 21:01.394
Well, when, when we give
the cure to the sheep

21:01.427 --> 21:02.963
they run so fast

21:02.996 --> 21:04.665
the poor sheepdogs
can’t keep up with them.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.001
W‐well, why didn’t you
say something?

21:09.636 --> 21:10.937
Quite frankly, cousin

21:10.971 --> 21:13.339
you never showed any interest
in the sheep at all.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.708
Not to speak of.

21:14.741 --> 21:15.776
Wait a minute.

21:15.809 --> 21:17.077
Maybe I can still get a bet.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.444
(male announcer)
’And the‐they’re off.’

21:18.478 --> 21:20.547
No! No! How can they be off

21:20.581 --> 21:22.916
when I’ve got
a ninety‐nine to one sure thing?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.484
When I can’t get a bet down!

21:24.518 --> 21:25.519
Why does this always
happen to me?

21:25.552 --> 21:28.488
Cool your Jetsons,
I bet enough for both of us.

21:28.522 --> 21:31.725
You did?
You did? God bless you!

21:31.758 --> 21:33.426
Come on, Fortune! Come on!

21:33.459 --> 21:34.761
Come on!

21:34.795 --> 21:35.929
Come on!

21:35.962 --> 21:38.999
Jennifer, we are going to Paris!

21:40.934 --> 21:44.871
Balki! Balki!
Thank you! Thank you.

21:44.905 --> 21:46.072
Come on!

21:49.109 --> 21:50.911
W‐wow!

21:50.944 --> 21:51.978
Come on, Fortune!

21:52.012 --> 21:53.514
‐Come on, Fortune.
‐Yes!

21:53.547 --> 21:56.082
[indistinct announcement]

22:01.688 --> 22:03.423
[cheering]

22:03.456 --> 22:05.826
Balki! Balki,
I don’t know how to thank you.

22:05.859 --> 22:08.695
‐You have made us rich!
‐Oh!

22:08.729 --> 22:10.697
How much did you bet?
$100? $200?

22:10.731 --> 22:12.633
‐Well, uh, no.
‐$300?

22:12.666 --> 22:14.034
You bet $300?

22:14.067 --> 22:16.937
‐That means we won $30,000.
‐O‐oh!

22:16.970 --> 22:18.204
‐Did you bet $300?
‐Uh...

22:18.238 --> 22:20.707
‐Not quite that much, cousin.
‐Not that much? Not that much?

22:20.741 --> 22:22.576
That’s okay. That’s okay.
What, you bet a hundred?

22:22.609 --> 22:25.111
‐That means we won $10,000.
‐O‐oh!

22:25.145 --> 22:27.548
Still enough for
a darn nice trip!

22:27.581 --> 22:29.883
Well, I think the important
thing is that Fortune won.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.618
Well, it’s one of the important
things, Mary Anne.

22:31.652 --> 22:33.419
Balki, how much did you bet?

22:33.453 --> 22:35.388
Two bucks, two bucks, all on
the nose, right on the nose.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.591
‐Two dollars?
‐Yeah.

22:37.624 --> 22:38.792
Two dollars?

22:38.825 --> 22:40.894
‐Larry, you won $200.
‐Yeah...

22:40.927 --> 22:42.395
[mumbles]

22:44.197 --> 22:45.866
That’s, that’s just enough

22:45.899 --> 22:48.401
to repair the hoof damage
to the bathtub.

22:49.603 --> 22:51.738
He only bet two dollars.

22:51.772 --> 22:54.708
[sobbing]

22:55.709 --> 22:58.444
