WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.602
[bats screeching]

00:10.210 --> 00:11.510
[together]
Trick or treat!

00:11.512 --> 00:13.178
I told you,
there's no way

00:13.180 --> 00:15.447
the Avengers are gonna be home
on Halloween.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.649
What do you mean?
Their lights are on.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.817
[grunts]
Huh?

00:18.819 --> 00:21.387
Who wants some candy?
[laughs]

00:21.389 --> 00:23.589
Awesome, it's Hulk!
I do! [laughs]

00:24.657 --> 00:25.824
[grunts]
Huh?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.893
[grunts]
[lightning whooshes]

00:29.829 --> 00:32.898
Nay, Hulk. It is my turn
to bestow the candy.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.702
Actually, Thor, it's my turn.
Huh?

00:36.704 --> 00:38.470
It's always my turn.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.273
[kids cheering]

00:42.675 --> 00:44.476
[Hulk landing]
Hit me!

00:47.247 --> 00:49.581
[chomping]

00:49.583 --> 00:51.150
Mmm.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.652
Not all my tech's
about taking out bad guys.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.855
Hey, Hulk, you and I
are tied for the lead.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.191
It has been ages
since a young one

00:59.193 --> 01:02.194
has come dressed
as the mighty Thor.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.897
Um... Actually like 20 minutes.

01:05.865 --> 01:06.965
[portal opening]

01:11.271 --> 01:13.238
Avengers...
[groans]

01:13.240 --> 01:14.473
Doctor Strange!

01:17.243 --> 01:19.878
I apologize for my appearance.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.580
Halloween is always
a busy night,

01:21.582 --> 01:24.550
but this year the threats
are coming faster than ever.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.784
I can't keep up.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.186
Oh, interesting.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.787
The Sorcerer Supreme.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.690
Protector of Earth
against mystical threats.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.226
Mr. Magic needs my help.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.462
I might find it
of some assistance.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.264
Dormammu has been unleashing
his mindless ones

01:39.266 --> 01:41.400
and flying demons
across the city.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.236
And his attacks
are only intensifying.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.771
[screams, panicking]

01:47.640 --> 01:50.375
[demons growling]

01:50.377 --> 01:52.377
Don't tell me.
Let me guess--

01:52.379 --> 01:54.446
mindless ones
and flying demons.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.616
So, Avengers, will
you join me in this fight?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.384
It will be my pleasure.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.353
[grunts]

02:07.627 --> 02:11.663
Kids, go home.
Things are about to get ugly.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.664
[growls]

02:12.666 --> 02:13.899
And they didn't even say,

02:13.901 --> 02:15.534
"trick or treat."

Hey, Hulk aren't food!

02:37.291 --> 02:38.957
[grunts]

02:38.959 --> 02:41.627
These monsters are no match
for my hammer.

02:41.629 --> 02:46.565
Nor are they a match
for the Vapors of Valtorr!

02:48.635 --> 02:49.701
[beam cannon firing]

02:52.872 --> 02:54.640
And we don't taste good either!

02:54.642 --> 02:57.709
[struggling, roars]

[grunts]

03:13.827 --> 03:16.361
My powers are depleted for now.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.864
Then let us do what we do best.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.898
[grunts]

03:19.900 --> 03:22.467
And what I do best is science.

Ha! And stay down.

Huh?

[roars]

03:32.980 --> 03:34.012
Huh?
[roars]

03:34.014 --> 03:36.014
Fly away, brute!

03:36.016 --> 03:38.417

03:38.419 --> 03:39.785
[beam whooshes]
[grunts]

03:43.890 --> 03:46.592
We must send them back
to the Dark Dimension.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.661
If I can generate enough power
to create a portal...

03:49.663 --> 03:50.696
[grunts]

03:50.698 --> 03:52.564
Mjolnir, to me!

[grunting]

03:58.606 --> 03:59.605
[dragon roars]

03:59.607 --> 04:01.707
Hurry! Push them

04:01.709 --> 04:04.409
into the portal
before it loses stability.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.477
[dragons growling]

04:07.013 --> 04:09.514

[yells]

04:19.625 --> 04:21.360
[groans]

04:21.362 --> 04:23.762
I guess I'll just send you
the bill for the damage?

04:23.764 --> 04:26.365
I'm afraid
there's more to come.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.366
What is it?

04:27.368 --> 04:29.434
It's far from over.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.636
Come with me.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.111
[Doctor Strange]
I sense a great
and powerful danger here.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.479
[kids chatting]

04:40.481 --> 04:42.581
[Iron Man] Okay.
If you say so.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.550
[chattering]

04:45.552 --> 04:48.787
Ha! Finally! One more
for each of us.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.623
Good thing Captain Marvel's
not playing.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.725
Captain Marvel power! Woo!

04:53.727 --> 04:56.928
Do I have to remind you how
serious this situation is?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.564
We need to find
the Mindless Ones now.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.066
They could be anyw--
Found them.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.734
[people screaming]

05:08.808 --> 05:11.643
A whole army for me to smash!

05:11.645 --> 05:13.912
[grunts]

05:13.914 --> 05:15.113
Trick or beat!

05:15.115 --> 05:16.982
Save some for me!
[grunts]

05:20.453 --> 05:22.888
By the Warrior Whips
of Jefallen!

05:24.691 --> 05:27.759
[beam shot]
[people screaming]

05:27.761 --> 05:29.594
[Iron Man]
Trick or treating's over
for tonight, folks.

05:29.596 --> 05:30.929
[grunts]

05:30.931 --> 05:33.865
Oh... uh, Stark
will pay for that.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.000
[gasps]

05:37.537 --> 05:38.704
Huh?

05:40.139 --> 05:41.773
[grunting]

05:42.709 --> 05:43.842
You're a brave kid.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.677
All clear, Hulk.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.712
[grunts]

05:51.884 --> 05:55.887
That didn't feel good at all!
[rubble crumbling]

05:55.889 --> 05:57.789
[grunts loudly]

06:00.993 --> 06:02.561
Any more tricks
up your sleeve?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.062
[grunts]

06:04.064 --> 06:05.964
Can't you just zap them away?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.632
[Doctor Strange]
There are too many.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.101
Well, at least they're
easy to smash.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.637
[grunts]

06:12.639 --> 06:13.739
Hit the road!

06:15.908 --> 06:17.042
Dorg.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.144
Is there an off switch
for this thing?

06:21.681 --> 06:23.849
Dormammu's attacks
have been relentless.

06:23.851 --> 06:27.486
This should be easy for me
but in my fatigue state... I--

06:28.988 --> 06:30.489
[groans]

06:34.160 --> 06:37.028
Friday, can you analyze
the energy Strange uses?

06:37.030 --> 06:39.598
<i>[Friday]</i>
<i>There is no match</i>
<i>to anything in my database.</i>

06:39.600 --> 06:41.833
<i>The closest is a form</i>
<i>of electrochemical energy.</i>

06:41.835 --> 06:45.036
All right, then tweak
the frequency of my repulsors
to match it.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.772
<i>[Friday]</i>
<i>I can get close,</i>

06:46.774 --> 06:48.940
<i>but it will take some</i>
<i>of your reserve power.</i>

06:48.942 --> 06:51.877
My magic skill
took years to perfect.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.446
Technology can't replace it.
[grunts]

06:54.448 --> 06:58.116
Unless you've got another idea,
I think it's time
to give real science a try.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.590
[grunting]

07:07.727 --> 07:10.195
Looks like they're all gone--
thanks to me.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.764
[panting]
This time.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.467
And smashing. Every time.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.869
<i>[Friday]</i>
<i>Security breach</i>
<i>at a Stark Facility</i>

07:17.871 --> 07:20.205
Your security breach
is no ordinary one.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.773
We must go there.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.675
Okay, everyone follow--

07:27.046 --> 07:30.115
Me. Or follow Strange.
Either one.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.556
Uh, this is not good.

07:38.724 --> 07:39.791
Not good at all.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.998
This looks like
your arc reactor.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.099
But not so puny.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.235
What use do you possibly have

07:50.237 --> 07:52.504
for an arc reactor that big...

07:52.506 --> 07:55.006
unless, of course,
it's to match
the size of your ego.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.509
This is where Stark Industries
conducts experiments

07:57.511 --> 07:59.611
that need massive amounts
of energy.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.681
Why would Dormammu's creatures
need your arc reactor?

08:02.683 --> 08:05.150
[creatures growling]

08:05.152 --> 08:07.586
[Iron Man]
I don't know,
but I'm not the kind of guy

08:07.588 --> 08:08.987
who likes to share his toys.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.992
[grunting]

08:17.163 --> 08:21.066
I'm starting to get mad!

08:26.005 --> 08:28.874
It's not working.
Friday, boost power!

08:28.876 --> 08:29.875
<i>[Friday]</i>
<i>But your reserves are--</i>

08:29.877 --> 08:30.942
Do it!

08:36.182 --> 08:39.650
It's too big.
We don't have enough energy.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.720
I know where we can find some.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.890
[grunts, roars]

08:44.892 --> 08:45.891
[grunts]

08:45.893 --> 08:47.893
Let's try this again.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.861
I'll siphon off some power
from the arc reactor

08:49.863 --> 08:50.929
to boost my repulsors.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.142
Now to shut down the reactor.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.045
[computerized clicking]

09:09.181 --> 09:11.750
Uh-oh! It ain't stayin' closed.

09:13.819 --> 09:15.720
And we have a new visitor.

09:15.722 --> 09:19.658
[fire rumbling]
[evil laughter]

09:19.660 --> 09:21.259
Dormammu!

09:21.261 --> 09:24.329
This is my pathetic
welcome committee?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.831
You do not belong here.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.234
Earth is exactly
where I belong.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.238
And I intend to rule it
until the end of time!

09:33.240 --> 09:37.342
But first, to get rid
of my nemesis, Doctor Strange

09:37.344 --> 09:39.110
and his little friends.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.113
Feel the power
of Dormammu!

09:42.115 --> 09:43.281
[grunts]

09:45.885 --> 09:50.288
Keeping Dormammu in check
should be child's play
but not tonight.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.724
My Mindless Ones weakened you.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.159
[blow hits]
[grunting]

10:00.900 --> 10:03.835
Avengers, are you--
[painful yelling]

10:06.272 --> 10:07.272
No!

10:07.274 --> 10:10.041
[evil cackling]

10:10.043 --> 10:11.977
Not the Eye of Agamotto!

10:14.080 --> 10:15.413
This cannot be.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.449
[evil laughter]

10:17.451 --> 10:21.152
With Dormammu in control
of its powers, we're doomed.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.224
Dormammu, ruler
of the Dark Dimension,

10:26.226 --> 10:28.326
has stolen the Eye of Agamotto.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.328
With this increase
in his power,

10:30.330 --> 10:32.631
he will soon become
unstoppable.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.633
Then let's go get it!

10:34.635 --> 10:36.001
I must warn you,

10:36.003 --> 10:38.903
it's a land ruled
by dark magic.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.839
I am used to it,
of course, but--

10:40.841 --> 10:43.274
Dark magic, light magic...
it's all just energy.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.444
The rules you're used to,
especially from other realms

10:46.446 --> 10:49.447
like Asgard,
don't always apply.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.350
[shrug]
I pretty much never
follow rules anyway.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.253
Know this, once
the portal closes,

10:55.255 --> 10:58.189
the only way back is to find
the Eye of Agamotto.

10:58.191 --> 11:02.260
Without it, you will be trapped
in the Dark Dimension forever.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.530
Well, then the sooner
we find it, the better.

11:05.532 --> 11:09.100
If I can reopen it
in my weakened state.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.405
Let me give it an energy boost.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.647
[grunting]

11:22.649 --> 11:24.149
Age before beauty!

11:24.151 --> 11:25.517
[jolts]

11:34.460 --> 11:35.927
[demon roars]

11:37.396 --> 11:41.299
He is a coward.
He dares not face us.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.703
Dormammu keeps
his most precious possessions
at his castle,

11:44.705 --> 11:47.338
deep in the heart
of the Dark Dimension.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.574
I'm already down
to 78 percent.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.076
My energy is not regenerating.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.377
We have to go now.

11:53.479 --> 11:54.646
We walk.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.314
The closer we get to Dormammu,

11:56.316 --> 11:57.515
the weaker you'll get.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.618
You need to save your power.
As do I.

12:05.157 --> 12:09.194
You'll find that all your
science doesn't help much
in a magical realm.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.830
Magic is just an advanced
form of science.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.433
Everything has a rational
explanation.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.236
Except for this landscaping.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.272
[Doctor Strange]
For someone trained in the use
of powerful forces,

12:21.274 --> 12:24.375
I guess magic has
a sort of logic,

12:24.377 --> 12:26.411
to use a simplistic term.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.081
[growling]
Magic goes beyond science.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.951
Only those who are worthy
can understand.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.754
[grunts]
[growling]

12:35.756 --> 12:38.523
Hard work and study
makes you worthy.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.359
What do you think, Hulk?
You're a scientist at heart.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.095
Less talking and more walking.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.232
Awfully quiet, Strange.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.234
He has fallen into the pit!

12:49.236 --> 12:51.636
[Doctor Strange]
Avengers! Avengers!

12:51.638 --> 12:53.571
No, it was Dormammu.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.974
And if the castle is where
he keeps his treasures,

12:55.976 --> 12:58.109
that's where
we'll find Strange.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.079
You seen any signs pointing us
towards the castle?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.447
Huh?
Huh?

13:06.118 --> 13:09.587
They could use some work
on their hospitality.

13:09.589 --> 13:12.323
Attacking Tony Stark's
arc reactor

13:12.325 --> 13:15.794
drew you and the eye
of Agamotto to me

13:15.796 --> 13:19.130
and gave me the power I needed
to take it from you.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.967
Now that I have the eye
of Agamotto,

13:22.969 --> 13:26.304
I am not limited to ruling
over the Dark Dimension.

13:26.306 --> 13:30.141
The whole universe
will be mine.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.978
You will witness
the new world order,

13:33.980 --> 13:36.915
dominated forever by Dormammu!

13:36.917 --> 13:41.119
Starting with Earth,
the keystone to the universe!

13:41.121 --> 13:45.089
The Eye was never meant
to be yours.
[yells]

13:45.091 --> 13:48.193
Give up hope,
my old foe.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.528
[groans]

13:50.530 --> 13:54.933
My armies await me, as does
your doomed little world.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.000
[snickers]

14:03.709 --> 14:08.479
[Hulk sighs]
For an evil headquarters,
they sure make it hard to find.

My sensors are picking up

but I don't see anything.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.816
[beam blow]

14:44.818 --> 14:46.551
Whoa!
[grunts]

14:50.322 --> 14:51.723
It's only visible
when it's hit.

14:51.725 --> 14:52.857
[grunting]

14:52.859 --> 14:55.226

[lightning fizzles]

15:15.015 --> 15:18.249
Strange man did say
something about powers

15:18.251 --> 15:20.084
not working like you expect.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.354
The Mindless Ones were herding
those invisible creatures.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.857
They must be part
of Dormammu's army.

15:25.859 --> 15:27.525
Then let's follow 'em!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.628
[demons growling]

15:32.431 --> 15:35.800
That is where
we will find Dormammu.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.303
My power's down to 50 percent.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.371
We don't have time
to fight all these things.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.941
Let's circle around. Maybe
there's a back entrance.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.076
[stomping]

15:45.078 --> 15:47.679
So much for avoiding a fight.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.694
[creature bites]
[screams]

16:04.730 --> 16:08.399
Since when did the Mindless Ones
become the indestructible ones?

16:08.401 --> 16:11.636
It's because Dormammu
has the Eye of Agamotto.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.638
Gotta save my power.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.306
Hulk, get me to that ledge.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.375
My pleasure.
[grunts]

16:23.248 --> 16:25.116
Okay, I've got a plan.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.151
I'll scan the lock
and have Friday

16:27.153 --> 16:27.986

16:29.621 --> 16:33.057
That must be the Dark Dimension
affecting your "powers" again.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.127
Indeed.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.629
[Dormammu]
Your friends are near,
but my army

16:38.631 --> 16:40.431
has already caught them.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.600
There is nothing left
to stop me

16:42.602 --> 16:45.837
from reigning over
the world for eternity.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.672

[grunts]

16:47.674 --> 16:50.141
Hate to rain on your parade,

16:50.143 --> 16:52.510
but eternity is
a really, really long time.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.212
You'll get so bored.

When we combined our powers
to close the portals,

Without it, the creatures
of the Dark Dimension

20:28.494 --> 20:29.994

magic problems

don't always have
a magic solution.

your technology in the future.

all the answers either.

If magic is a science
I don't understand,

20:58.725 --> 21:01.392
I'm glad there's someone
who does.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.361
And that Crimson Bands
of Cyttorak spell

21:03.363 --> 21:05.663

of handy at times.
