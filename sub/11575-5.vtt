WEBVTT

00:10.219 --> 00:11.595
So...

00:12.346 --> 00:15.964
which one of these
jokers is going down?

00:16.058 --> 00:17.138
Poor things.

00:17.226 --> 00:20.343
They have no idea
what they're getting into.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.178
How about I break
that stallion's back?

00:22.273 --> 00:24.013
He '5 a Hydra.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.353
Nine heads.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.317
I see only one.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.144
Not those kinds
of heads.

00:31.616 --> 00:33.732
--Oh.
--Mmhmm.

00:34.619 --> 00:36.325
Oh...
okay.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.574
Well, there '5 that
perky, young thing.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.920
I bet she smells
like daffodils.

00:46.005 --> 00:48.246
Well, it'll be a while
before she blooms.

00:48.341 --> 00:50.548
she's taken a
thousand-year vow of chastity.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.375
I could make her
change her mind.

00:54.430 --> 00:59.094
You're an irresistible,
unstoppable sex machine...

01:00.061 --> 01:02.518
Who | wish I could
keep up with.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.851
Are you sure this
is what you want?

01:07.985 --> 01:09.976
TRICK: What evening
adventures are afoot

01:10.071 --> 01:12.904
for the loveliest ladies
in the six counties?

01:12.990 --> 01:13.775
Well...

01:13.866 --> 01:16.608
I'm working on some new
injections to curb Bo's hunger.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.988
she's developed a
resistance to the old ones

01:19.080 --> 01:22.868
and since I can't keep up with
her voracious sexual appetite,

01:22.959 --> 01:24.745
we're looking for
someone who can...

01:24.835 --> 01:27.872
...satisfy her
coital requirements.

01:29.215 --> 01:33.925
So many glasses...
must polish...

01:36.430 --> 01:37.715
What I mean is--

01:39.642 --> 01:41.132
This is
what I want.

01:42.228 --> 01:43.593
I want you.

01:43.980 --> 01:48.064
And yes, dating a Succubus
is not without its challenges.

01:49.026 --> 01:49.981
But...

01:51.362 --> 01:54.946
The secret to any
relationship is trust.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.148
And understanding.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.033
And compromise.

02:00.997 --> 02:02.157
Wow...

02:02.999 --> 02:06.116
You are being so
mature about this.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.000
Are you sure?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.496
Really sure?

02:13.843 --> 02:15.959
As long as you
follow the one rule.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.594
No wolf.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.303
Got it.

02:20.391 --> 02:22.552
Besides, it'll give my
tired pubococcygeus

02:22.643 --> 02:24.349
a well deserved rest.

02:24.437 --> 02:25.927
[Laughing]

02:46.042 --> 02:47.373
BOTH: Her.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.495
Game on...

03:26.999 --> 03:28.580
Hey, baby.

03:30.044 --> 03:30.749
Hey.

03:30.795 --> 03:31.875
You're back early.

03:31.962 --> 03:32.917
Yeah.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.745
Is everything okay?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.705
Yeah, fine,
totally, uh--

03:36.801 --> 03:39.417
The conference finished
a little early, so...

03:41.013 --> 03:43.095
You look so nice.

03:43.432 --> 03:44.672
This?

03:44.767 --> 03:48.931
Oh you know, I'm just
trying something different.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.891
You like?

03:57.029 --> 03:57.939
What's wrong, baby?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.190
Ugh--

04:00.199 --> 04:01.564
I'm sorry.

04:03.035 --> 04:03.945
Graeme...

04:05.162 --> 04:06.538
what happened?

04:06.622 --> 04:09.989
There's something--
I have to tell you--

04:14.380 --> 04:15.335
Ahh!

04:15.423 --> 04:16.879
Ahhh!

04:18.759 --> 04:20.135
Oh, God--

04:21.637 --> 04:23.969
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

04:24.807 --> 04:27.093
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.884
My love carries
a death sentence.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.016
l was lost for years...

04:33.107 --> 04:34.688
Searching while hiding...

04:35.609 --> 04:38.772
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.312
I won't hide anymore.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.114
I will live the life
I choose.

05:07.725 --> 05:10.057
Acidity: 7.35.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.094
Amylayse:

05:15.608 --> 05:17.564
Sixty units
per Litre.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.523
Nitrogen:

05:21.614 --> 05:23.320
[Furniture banging
and moaning]

05:23.407 --> 05:25.773
Thirty micrograms
per deca-Litre.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.530
Is this going
to take long?

05:28.621 --> 05:29.110
Pardon?

05:29.163 --> 05:30.699
The bed antics.

05:34.043 --> 05:34.998
Well, you know...

05:35.085 --> 05:36.950
Science takes time.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.332
Keep calm and
carry out experiments.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.959
Does that mean
you'll be underfoot,

05:41.050 --> 05:43.587
"experimenting",
for quite some time?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.713
Well, once Bo reaches--

05:45.804 --> 05:47.055
[Clatter]

05:47.139 --> 05:49.926
completion, |'|| gather
some more blood samples

05:50.017 --> 05:51.757
and compare them
to her baselines.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.137
So I can improve
her treatments.

05:53.229 --> 05:56.062
I'm guessing that
the key is to suppress

05:56.148 --> 05:57.888
the spike of
hydroxyprogesterone.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.314
[Moaning]

05:59.401 --> 06:00.436
[Gasp]

06:00.528 --> 06:02.894
It's on!
She wants our help!

06:02.988 --> 06:04.398
I gotta go tell Bo.

06:04.823 --> 06:05.903
No, no, no, Kenzi! No--

06:05.991 --> 06:08.152
Now's not really
a great time--

06:18.045 --> 06:19.330
KENZI:
Oh, Bo-Bo!

06:19.421 --> 06:21.582
LAUREN: And oh my lord,
there '5 choking.

06:22.758 --> 06:23.713
Drop everything!

06:23.801 --> 06:26.133
I found this total
amaze-balls case for us!

06:26.220 --> 06:29.758
Maybe a topic for conversation
at a more non-naked time, Kenzi.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.054
I'm... sorry.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.348
Hi!
How are you?

06:33.435 --> 06:34.891
l was great.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.220
As we speak,
humans are dying.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.431
They're going all gloopy,
slipping into slime,

06:40.526 --> 06:42.312
liquefying on
their loved ones.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.268
They need
our help, Bo.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.694
And they need it stat.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.488
I'm kind of in the middle
of something, Kenzi.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.783
No, you're right.
Knocking bits is

06:50.869 --> 06:53.451
way more important
than saving lives.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.966
I've been online for hours,
looking for people

07:12.057 --> 07:13.137
who might need our help.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.761
Since when
do you do that?

07:14.852 --> 07:17.059
One of us has
to keep an eye out.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.101
Evil never sleeps,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.395
even if we're having
"sleep-overs."

07:21.191 --> 07:21.646
Right.

07:21.692 --> 07:24.024
Anyway, I've been lM-ing
with this human lady;

07:24.111 --> 07:25.976
she's been posting
on all these self-help

07:26.071 --> 07:27.572
medical-crypto-con
spiracy-whack-nut

07:27.656 --> 07:29.112
chat boards
begging for help.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.325
What happened?

07:30.409 --> 07:31.945
Her husband came home
from a business trip

07:32.036 --> 07:34.322
and turned to green
ooze right in front of her.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.654
Just as she was trying
to raise his "interest."

07:36.749 --> 07:37.659
Oh...

07:37.750 --> 07:38.990
Well, it sounds like
Fae involvement,

07:39.084 --> 07:41.200
but it could be anything.
Has she called the police?

07:41.295 --> 07:43.377
She didn't have to.
Before she could dial 911,

07:43.464 --> 07:44.954
the so-called
authorities showed up

07:45.049 --> 07:46.664
and Molly Maided
the mess away...

07:46.759 --> 07:48.374
and get this,
they took his suitcase,

07:48.469 --> 07:50.005
and they took his phone,
and they said that

07:50.095 --> 07:52.757
they would be in touch
after their "investigation."

07:52.848 --> 07:55.590
Something tells me she's
going to be waiting a long time.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.640
I'm guessing a group
of Fae covered up

07:57.728 --> 07:59.309
their tracks after
a feed got away.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.647
I hate to say it,

08:00.731 --> 08:03.097
but I'm not sure what
good I'd be right now.

08:03.192 --> 08:03.977
Seriously?

08:05.069 --> 08:06.900
What if other humans
are in danger?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.318
Don't you care
about my kind?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.520
Well, no...

08:09.615 --> 08:11.526
Kenzi, I didn't
mean that at all.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.107
| just--

08:13.202 --> 08:15.534
Well, I need
some time to--

08:15.621 --> 08:16.235
Fine.

08:17.790 --> 08:20.998
| just thought it would be
something we could do together,

08:21.085 --> 08:23.497
Bo and Kenzi to the
rescue, you know?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.745
I haven't seen much
of you. Lately.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.920
Never mind,
it's stupid--

08:31.011 --> 08:32.842
No. Kenzi.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.383
We'll look into this.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.555
We should get
to work right away.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.554
I'll see if there's any
evidence left behind,

08:39.645 --> 08:40.930
before it deteriorates.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.522
Right right away?

08:42.606 --> 08:44.938
Oh, well... Kenzi
and I can go ahead

08:45.025 --> 08:46.890
and then we'll catch up
with you after--

08:46.985 --> 08:48.111
Great!
Thanks!

08:49.196 --> 08:52.529
And, Bo, I left...
a cup... by the sink.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.731
For when you're done.

08:53.826 --> 08:56.238
Thanks, I'm
already so thirsty.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.320
No. No, no--
It's for your...

08:59.415 --> 09:00.996
...sa
mple!

09:02.835 --> 09:04.791
For my... science!

09:06.547 --> 09:07.536
You want to go?

09:07.631 --> 09:08.586
So much.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.751
We were
having problems.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.962
The spark wasn't
there, you know?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.965
In the bedroom.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.894
He said it was work, he
was tired, he was stressed.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.892
l was trying to
spice things up,

09:25.983 --> 09:27.939
but it's like
the more I tried,

09:28.026 --> 09:30.893
the more bored he got,
the more he pulled away...

09:30.988 --> 09:32.944
And now
he's a puddle.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.896
[Crying]

09:34.992 --> 09:37.825
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.282
What's your
show called again?

09:40.372 --> 09:42.363
"Paranormal
Hot-vestigators."

09:43.417 --> 09:45.874
And when do the
cameras get here?

09:45.961 --> 09:46.586
[Door opening]

09:46.628 --> 09:47.913
Graeme?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.541
Graeme, baby, why aren't
you answering your phone?

09:49.631 --> 09:50.666
Are you okay, baby?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.123
Who the
hell are you?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.135
l'm Delia.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.551
Graeme's, um...

09:56.638 --> 09:57.969
lover.

09:58.056 --> 09:58.841
Where is he?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.888
Uh, he kicked
the bucket.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.970
Uh, he kicked
the bucket... um-lover.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.810
No, that's impossible.
I was just with him!

10:08.901 --> 10:10.516
I knew it.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.567
I knew he was
cheating on me.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.895
He wasn't cheating.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.902
He was emotionally
true to me.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.733
He loved me.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.113
What did
you do to him?!

10:21.205 --> 10:23.287
That's what we at
"Paranormal Hot-vestigators"

10:23.373 --> 10:24.749
are investigating.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.915
He said he was
finally going to tell you.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.209
And he did--
and you killed him!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.878
More like he was going
to give you up, wasn't he?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.125
And so you
poisoned him!

10:33.217 --> 10:34.923
[Slap]
Ow!

10:35.010 --> 10:36.546
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.171
Bo!

10:37.221 --> 10:37.960
Stop it!

10:38.013 --> 10:39.378
BO:
Hey, hey, hey...

10:40.224 --> 10:42.010
Easy...

10:43.018 --> 10:44.349
You know, one day
we'll get past women

10:44.436 --> 10:45.972
stabbing each
other in the back

10:46.063 --> 10:47.553
and clawing each
other's eyes out--

10:47.648 --> 10:49.138
For a guy.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.725
Now, I'd like to
welcome everyone

10:52.820 --> 10:56.688
to Bo's first-ever
two-for-one special.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.486
We'll start with you.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.946
Tell me everything.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.540
Graeme and l have
been together forever.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.115
Like, six months
at least.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.950
We were soul mates.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.080
Of course you were.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.753
Every time that he was
"away on business"

11:13.841 --> 11:16.253
he was shacked up with me,
just down the street.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.584
He kept saying he
was going to move in.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.965
Did you ever get up
to anything unusual?

11:21.056 --> 11:22.921
Hang out with
any weird people?

11:23.016 --> 11:26.600
Well, there was this one
cool club we liked to go to.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.564
We were there
last night before he just--

11:30.524 --> 11:31.684
you know...

11:32.150 --> 11:33.185
ran off on me...

11:34.820 --> 11:36.310
What "club?"

11:58.427 --> 12:01.169
Mmm...
Smorgasbord.

12:08.979 --> 12:09.968
Wow.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.599
I haven't seen this
many delicious buns

12:11.690 --> 12:13.055
since bake-off
night at The Dal.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.731
Just think of
wrinkled old men

12:14.818 --> 12:16.900
and their wrinkled
old raisins.

12:16.987 --> 12:21.321
[Phone ringing]

12:23.201 --> 12:25.112
Dr. Lewis' lover.

12:25.203 --> 12:25.988
LAUREN: Hi.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.120
Graeme was liquefied
by a Fae secretion.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.037
The substance rapidly
broke down his cells

12:30.125 --> 12:31.581
once it entered
his body.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.825
Secretions
inside him?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.536
You think maybe our
little horndog Graeme

12:37.424 --> 12:38.755
That would be
my guess.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.503
This would be
the place for it.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.630
I think Hefner
summers here.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.928
Can I get you
something to eat?

12:45.015 --> 12:47.552
He looks... dee-lish.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.725
Graeme may have
infected both his wife

12:50.812 --> 12:51.892
and his girlfriend.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.220
I'm working
on an antidote.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.522
I'll see if I can
find a randy Fae

12:55.609 --> 12:57.520
and keep it from
molesting any more soft,

12:57.611 --> 12:58.896
warm humans.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.062
What are you wearing?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.731
You feeling alright?

13:03.825 --> 13:05.361
The sexual energy
in this place

13:05.452 --> 13:06.988
really goes
to eleven.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.074
Okay.
Great.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.120
Have fun!

13:15.045 --> 13:15.830
Oh, hey!

13:15.921 --> 13:17.331
BTW, what was up
with that

13:20.008 --> 13:21.214
l was!

13:21.301 --> 13:23.292
There was this 2-for-1 sausage
dealio and I wanted

13:23.387 --> 13:25.799
to know if you wanted one
but you didn't pick up

13:25.889 --> 13:28.130
so I ate both of them
and life was good.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.557
That's pretty much
exactly what I guessed.

13:34.398 --> 13:35.934
Welcome.
M'lady.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.557
Roman requests
your presence.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.525
I'll take point.
You stay here,

13:43.615 --> 13:45.151
see if you can
figure out which Fae

13:45.242 --> 13:46.732
are getting jiggy
with the humans.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.317
But leave me
your phone.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.323
For pics.
Mine's outta juice.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.649
She's Fae.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.982
Dumped within the last
couple of hours, I'd say.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.533
Well, somebody went
to town on her.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.906
Patterned contusions,
abrasions...

14:32.998 --> 14:34.954
I'm guessing
strangulation.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.784
Can't know for sure
without an autopsy.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.664
Let's take her
to Lauren.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.342
What?

14:50.974 --> 14:52.089
Second scent.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.640
Also Fae?

14:55.020 --> 14:55.975
Yeah...

14:58.982 --> 15:00.643
Bo.

15:08.033 --> 15:08.988
M'lady.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.954
As | live
and breathe...

15:17.042 --> 15:19.533
The Succubus
in my club.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.335
Mi Bacchanal es
su Bacchanal.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.458
Now when you
say Bacchanal--

15:24.549 --> 15:27.586
Roman the Bacchus,
at your service.

15:29.805 --> 15:32.296
| gorge myself
on debauchery.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.881
We Bacchi were revered
by the ancient humans

15:34.976 --> 15:38.343
for throwing
the best soirees.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.138
Enjoy my
hospitality...

15:48.406 --> 15:49.566
Wow...

15:50.992 --> 15:54.530
A little bit of Fae ecstasy
goes a long way...

15:55.038 --> 15:56.744
Who do you think
helped the humans

15:56.832 --> 15:58.163
come up with
that little pill?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.081
Now...

16:02.212 --> 16:03.952
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

16:05.090 --> 16:07.046
Well, Roman...

16:08.093 --> 16:11.085
I hear you're the guy
to see about, what else?

16:12.013 --> 16:12.968
Sex.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.763
A Succubus, seeking
me out for sex--

16:16.685 --> 16:19.848
You do me honour,
you enticing creature.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.304
I'm all, uh...

16:22.399 --> 16:23.388
Ears.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.775
How 'bout
a little privacy?

16:35.078 --> 16:36.409
So...

16:38.623 --> 16:40.739
You seem like
a man of the world.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.995
You certainly know
how to throw a party.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.880
You should see this
place after hours.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.750
Black tie.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.251
Often nothing else.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.082
[Giggling]

16:52.804 --> 16:55.671
What's the craziest thing
you've ever done in bed?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.306
Sleep.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.307
DYSON:
We brought you a patient.

17:07.819 --> 17:08.808
Yeah.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.144
I don't think she's
going to make it.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.354
We want to know
what killed her.

17:13.909 --> 17:14.944
Where was she found?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.447
The tracks...
By Bo's house.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.537
Any sign of struggle
on the scene?

17:20.624 --> 17:22.910
No. She was
moved there post-mortem.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.241
Cause of death...

17:24.336 --> 17:25.917
allergic reaction
to a Succubus?

17:26.004 --> 17:27.585
By any chance?

17:30.842 --> 17:35.506
Instead of the blunt-force
trauma and severe...

17:35.597 --> 17:37.713
lacerations that
are fairly obvious?

17:37.807 --> 17:40.014
We wouldn't want to rule
out any possibilities.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.808
You know, have a killer
roaming the streets

17:42.896 --> 17:43.976
or something.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.097
Mmhmm.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.899
I'll do a full autopsy.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.362
Thank you.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.899
Hey!
You always do

17:53.990 --> 17:56.322
dissections this close
to your kitchen?

17:56.493 --> 17:57.733
Occasionally.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.954
Oh, ever switch
a liver for liver?

18:00.997 --> 18:01.747
Ra rely.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.121
Victim's face
ring any bells?

18:03.208 --> 18:04.243
I've never
seen her before.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.620
And I don't appreciate being
treated like a criminal.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.624
Let us know when
you have a C.O.D.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.892
"The girl from
the bar is dead.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.023
Call me, luv Lauren."

18:34.114 --> 18:36.981
See ya, wouldn't
wanna be ya.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.999
Key holders only.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.339
[Hiss]

19:00.598 --> 19:02.884
You taste like spiced
cocoa on my palette.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.934
Well, you should see what
I'm like on the rest of you.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.564
So...

19:09.399 --> 19:11.515
You big
Bacchus, you...

19:11.609 --> 19:15.272
Which Fae are getting intimate
with humans around here?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.897
I don't keep track
of all the shucking.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.950
And besides, people expect
anonymity in a place like this.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.743
Oh...

19:23.830 --> 19:25.331
I think you're lying...

19:25.415 --> 19:27.155
I think you do know.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.708
Because a bad, bad
boy sent someone

19:30.795 --> 19:34.754
to clean up...
a bad, bad mess.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.502
What kind of mess?

19:37.260 --> 19:40.423
Something
caused a human...

19:41.014 --> 19:42.970
...to go all gooey.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.558
Sorry, darling.

19:47.979 --> 19:51.563
Your cheap Succubus tricks
are not doing it for me.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.932
[Laughing]

19:54.027 --> 19:56.518
Cheap, my ass.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.313
I'll have you know my
so-called tricks routinely

19:59.407 --> 20:00.738
get a standing ovation.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.316
So why the hell
are you such a dud?

20:03.411 --> 20:04.366
Hm.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.489
Thanks for the
hospitality, Roman.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.246
You certainly know how
to show a girl a good time.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.498
Anytime, Succubus.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.046
Come again.
I know I will.

20:21.971 --> 20:25.714
I think you should pay a visit
to the dead human's wife.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.549
And his girlfriend too.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.976
And the Succubus?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.975
If she returns...
cut her throat.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.071
Tall, dark,
and caffeinated.

20:45.829 --> 20:46.909
I'll take one
of those.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.861
Bo, you can't
be here right now.

20:48.957 --> 20:50.697
Geez, give me
two minutes.

20:52.377 --> 20:56.086
I had myself a delightful visit
to Club Liberalia last night.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.082
The Bacchanalian club?

20:57.173 --> 20:58.913
Trust me--
it was all business.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.624
|'m following up on this dead
human thing I'm working on.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.005
I think the owner,
Roman, might be connected

21:04.097 --> 21:05.633
to a guy
who got slimed.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.179
That's great, Bo,
but now is not the time.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.178
Just tell me, am
| on the right track?

21:09.269 --> 21:10.600
Maybe.
Roman's Light Fae.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.929
If he's leaving a trail of dead
humans, that's a concern.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.854
Dead humans, huh?

21:15.942 --> 21:16.931
It's the trail of dead Fae

21:17.026 --> 21:19.984
that really had me
sit up and tweet.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.115
Know that one?

21:38.381 --> 21:39.712
Yeah, check again.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.131
It's only been,
like, two minutes.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.217
I told Bo
to meet me here,

21:44.304 --> 21:46.590
she's not even
answering my text.

21:47.765 --> 21:48.720
l have something
to tell her,

21:48.808 --> 21:49.718
I don't know
where she is.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.300
Cop shop. She went
to talk to Dyson.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.976
Alone.

21:54.606 --> 21:55.641
Why?

21:55.732 --> 21:57.063
Why not?

21:57.609 --> 21:59.850
That woman
from the other night?

21:59.944 --> 22:01.320
Her body turned up.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.895
The cupcake Bo
was eating in bed?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.321
So?

22:05.867 --> 22:08.324
So, I didn't tell Dyson
that I knew her.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.618
Or even that Bo...
knew her.

22:10.705 --> 22:11.865
No biggie.

22:12.624 --> 22:13.784
No biggie?

22:14.375 --> 22:15.876
I should have
called Bo.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.370
You have a
secret about Bo.

22:17.462 --> 22:18.872
Dyson has a
secret about Bo.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.248
Everyone's got secrets.

22:21.007 --> 22:21.541
Excuse me?

22:21.591 --> 22:23.081
Oop--

22:23.176 --> 22:25.838
Fabulous boot
in mouth again.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.056
Kenzi--

22:29.140 --> 22:34.100
Well, clearly, something's
been up with the wolfman.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.929
Have you seen how
he looks at her?

22:37.023 --> 22:39.389
Well, yeah, he's been
acting kind of--

22:39.984 --> 22:41.315
But, I just
thought that--

22:41.402 --> 22:42.903
That you were
imagining things?

22:42.987 --> 22:45.524
Bo wouldn't keep something
like that from me.

22:45.615 --> 22:46.730
You think?

22:46.824 --> 22:49.315
She did nail him
behind your back.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.116
"To heal"...

22:51.204 --> 22:52.569
Yeah, sure.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.163
Hey, that doesn't mean
you won't be the first

22:56.251 --> 22:58.867
to get a
Valentine's Day card.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.079
Lauren, you are
the best thing

23:02.173 --> 23:04.289
that has ever happened
to Bo, honestly.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.715
I'm only
telling you this

23:05.802 --> 23:07.713
'cause I don't want
you to be sideswiped.

23:07.804 --> 23:11.012
Because if it is true that
Dyson still loves Bo...

23:13.184 --> 23:14.720
TRICK: What are
we talking about?

23:14.811 --> 23:15.971
The case.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.105
What do you
have so far?

23:18.189 --> 23:19.725
Human goo.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.306
Sexually-transmitted
Fae gu n k,

23:21.401 --> 23:24.108
Bacchus sex club,
mystery door.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.526
Mystery door?

23:25.613 --> 23:28.320
Initiates only-- you need
a special key to get in.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.406
I might have...

23:32.120 --> 23:33.360
one of those keys.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.452
What can I say --
it was the 70s.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.082
The 1870s.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.914
But, back then, it was
more of a social club.

23:46.009 --> 23:48.876
Hmmmm
"social club", do tell.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.552
Just racy
daguerreotypes.

23:52.974 --> 23:55.056
Monthly themed bashes.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.308
But believe you me...

23:57.395 --> 24:00.603
there's no bash like
a Bacchinalian bash.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.021
Uh-huh...

24:02.108 --> 24:04.895
Of course, there was
nothing Dark

24:04.986 --> 24:06.692
about the scene
back then.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.237
Nothing dangerous.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.904
Totes.
Is that the key?

24:13.995 --> 24:15.326
I wonder...

24:15.413 --> 24:17.278
Maybe I should
go with you.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.238
I knew Roman long ago
and if there's trouble

24:19.334 --> 24:21.450
at the club, I might be
able to talk to him.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.159
You wanna get kinky
at a sex club

24:23.254 --> 24:24.243
with your
granddaughter?

24:24.339 --> 24:26.295
That is in no
way what I just said.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.589
I'm sure Bo would
appreciate you taking on

24:28.676 --> 24:29.882
the "grandfather" role.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.506
I am her grandfather.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.212
Technically.
But--

24:35.308 --> 24:36.673
Nevermind.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.016
What?

24:40.813 --> 24:44.897
Look, I'm sure Bo is happy
to have you in her life,

24:44.984 --> 24:47.896
but you knew about her,
for like, what, thirty years,

24:47.987 --> 24:49.943
and you did
nothing to find her.

24:50.031 --> 24:53.114
She needed her family,
and you weren't there.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.616
Did Bo tell you this?

24:58.831 --> 24:59.695
| see.

24:59.791 --> 25:00.746
Well then.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.701
You should go
without me.

25:05.588 --> 25:08.330
I think it's
for the best, Trickster.

25:09.592 --> 25:12.334
How much do I owe you
for the beer, barkeep?

25:13.596 --> 25:14.551
Very fu n ny.

25:15.390 --> 25:18.473
Cool. Freebie.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.522
What was the nature
of your interaction

25:26.609 --> 25:27.724
with the dead woman?

25:27.819 --> 25:28.774
Social.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.726
You were friends?

25:30.822 --> 25:32.187
Friendly.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.524
Look, Bo, we found
her body by the tracks

25:36.619 --> 25:38.120
a block away
from your place.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.944
And what we're
wondering here is--

25:40.832 --> 25:41.867
How did she get there?

25:41.958 --> 25:43.698
You think that I did this?

25:43.793 --> 25:46.079
Well, you don't even remember
how she left your apartment.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.421
Yes, I do.

25:47.505 --> 25:48.665
How?

25:48.965 --> 25:50.796
In one piece.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.882
Yes, I had sex with her,
but I didn't kill her.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.634
One body
with my scent on it,

25:58.725 --> 26:00.306
does not make
me a murderer.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.348
Two.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.225
What?

26:03.312 --> 26:05.018
Two bodies.

26:05.106 --> 26:06.642
If you count
the Dark Fae in a coma.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.477
Okay, yes,
it's starting to--

26:15.408 --> 26:16.523
So it's another
Succubus!

26:16.617 --> 26:18.323
Or someone who's
trying to frame me!

26:18.411 --> 26:19.742
[Laughing]

26:19.829 --> 26:21.945
Oh, that
old chestnut.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.077
Bo... Say nothing
without your lawyer.

26:25.168 --> 26:26.123
Kenzi--

26:26.210 --> 26:28.952
Bo had nothing to
do with that girl's death.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.502
l was so there.
I watched the bitch

26:30.590 --> 26:32.126
walk out the door
with my own eyes.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.047
Well, that's
a convenient alibi.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.875
Come on, Bo,
let's get out of here.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.130
lgot the key
we need,

26:37.221 --> 26:39.507
so it's time Betty
and Veronica got back

26:39.599 --> 26:40.509
to saving the world.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.510
DYSON: Bo.

26:41.601 --> 26:42.886
We can't hold you.

26:42.977 --> 26:46.344
But just so you know, Lauren
is examining the body.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.937
So I'm free to go
back to the club then.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.731
Absolutely.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.729
Have fun.
I know we will.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.605
Excuse me?

26:53.696 --> 26:55.106
Well, we'll be
coming with you.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.529
Until we crack
this case,

26:56.616 --> 26:59.323
I'm going to be
your very sexy shadow.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.290
Kenzi, did you really
see that girl leave?

27:15.384 --> 27:16.294
Sure.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.091
Which dress:
purple or blue?

27:18.179 --> 27:20.511
I need to know that
you actually watched her

27:20.598 --> 27:21.883
walk out the door.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.886
Bo, this is not
a happy-time convo.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.720
I totally watched hot
pants make her hot exit.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.101
Now, let's just concentrate
on the fun...

27:31.192 --> 27:33.023
...of us together!

27:34.195 --> 27:35.059
Post sex club?

27:35.154 --> 27:38.066
We should totally hit
the casino at Niagara.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.567
Ambush hug!

27:40.368 --> 27:42.279
Kenzi, you
hate casinos.

27:42.370 --> 27:45.077
Or as you call them,
"amateur hour for suckers."

27:45.164 --> 27:48.622
I say a lot of crazy things,
but at least I'm loyal.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.496
Meaning?

27:51.587 --> 27:54.420
Honey, why do you think
the cops are hot on your tail?

27:54.507 --> 27:56.463
Lauren spilled
everything.

27:56.551 --> 27:58.212
That the girl
was in your bed.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.088
The whole
choking thing.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.294
Lauren told
them that?

28:01.389 --> 28:04.051
Yeah, she was pretty
torn up about it.

28:04.141 --> 28:08.009
But you know how she is:
duty before booty.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.519
[Phone ringing]

28:10.606 --> 28:11.721
Is that my phone?

28:12.149 --> 28:13.013
Oh yeah.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.599
[Phone ringing]

28:14.694 --> 28:16.935
Oh!
Speak of the devil.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.987
[Phone ringing]

28:20.950 --> 28:22.906
Hey, Lauren.

28:22.994 --> 28:24.609
We were just
talking about you.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.865
Are you all right?
Did you talk to Dyson?

28:26.956 --> 28:28.947
Yeah, well, he did
most of the talking.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.373
Interrogating,
actually.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.496
I'm so sorry.
I texted you.

28:33.588 --> 28:34.748
Yeah...

28:35.172 --> 28:36.548
I didn't get it.

28:36.632 --> 28:37.917
But... thanks.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.625
Anyway, look, lthink
I've found a remedy

28:40.720 --> 28:42.381
for the Fae secretion.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.723
Well, look, I'm headed
back to the club now,

28:44.807 --> 28:46.468
but I'll shut down
whatever's going on,

28:46.559 --> 28:47.890
and bring the
infected to you.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.717
Okay, look...
Be careful.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.313
I'll be fine.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.888
Dyson is
coming with.

28:53.983 --> 28:54.893
He is?

28:54.984 --> 28:56.724
I'm kind of
a suspect now.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.059
But it's fine.

28:58.154 --> 29:00.861
Nothing like having your ex
on your ass in a sex club.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.279
Okay.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.277
Well, have fun.

29:21.636 --> 29:22.671
Funny.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.094
Bo didn't tell me to
dress for the Sex Ball.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.546
Yeah, I wonder why.

29:26.641 --> 29:28.302
So what's your
angle here, huh?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.303
You want to watch Bo
not kill someone?

29:30.394 --> 29:31.975
Maybe I just want
to see the Succubus

29:32.063 --> 29:33.724
in her natural element.

29:33.814 --> 29:34.974
She didn't do it.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.146
Okay...

29:41.197 --> 29:42.152
Detectives.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.321
Ladies.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.788
Lauren?

30:05.596 --> 30:07.678
Hey guys.
Where've you been?

30:12.812 --> 30:13.927
Let's go.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.398
So, what gives?

30:20.987 --> 30:22.022
I give.

30:22.113 --> 30:24.069
I mean,
I will... give.

30:24.949 --> 30:26.280
I brought the antidote.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.857
The virus may
not effect Fae,

30:27.952 --> 30:30.068
but I have to treat
the affected humans

30:30.162 --> 30:31.493
before the
substance mutates.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.865
which very well
could happen

30:32.957 --> 30:34.913
if it keeps jumping
the species barrier.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.491
Right...

30:36.585 --> 30:39.497
Time to use what the
good goddess gave me.

30:49.473 --> 30:50.724
This way
to the party?

30:50.808 --> 30:52.514
Only if you
got the ticket.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.167
Roman Tyresius...

31:21.589 --> 31:23.329
In the flesh.

31:24.592 --> 31:27.049
We're here in
the name of the Light.

31:27.136 --> 31:28.296
And the Dark.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.968
Oh, my, my...

31:30.598 --> 31:33.305
Did someone get her
chocolate in his peanut butter?

31:33.392 --> 31:36.099
Looks like you're having
quite the love-fest, Roman.

31:36.187 --> 31:37.302
[Chuckling]

31:37.396 --> 31:38.806
Is this a raid?

31:38.898 --> 31:41.014
Because I can assure you
that the high officials

31:41.108 --> 31:43.941
of both the Light and the
Dark who frequent my club

31:44.028 --> 31:45.643
will have something
to say about it.

31:45.738 --> 31:47.069
You've got
the wrong idea, Roman.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.067
We're just here
to look around.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.739
Well, by all means...

31:51.160 --> 31:54.823
I think you'll find
there's lots to see.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.301
Psst!
Hood-buddy.

32:11.388 --> 32:12.889
What's in the room?

32:12.973 --> 32:15.931
Pure... sexual... ecstasy.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.885
BO: Yeah, that
sounds about right...

32:18.979 --> 32:20.890
Those low frequencies,
with that set of overtones

32:20.981 --> 32:22.972
can only be created
by the vocal tract

32:23.067 --> 32:25.900
of one UnderFae--
a Manta.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.897
A what-ah?

32:33.953 --> 32:36.160
Holy Octopussy...

32:40.167 --> 32:41.327
l was right.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.704
We're listening to the
mating sounds of a Manta.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.457
Duh.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.630
It's a tentacled,
hermaphrodite UnderFae.

32:47.716 --> 32:50.458
It can only survive in
subtropical environments.

32:50.553 --> 32:53.135
You mean humid, wet,
and reeking of eucalyptus?

32:53.222 --> 32:55.929
I'm going to guess that's how
the humans are being infected.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.472
So what
happens next?

32:58.018 --> 32:59.974
Nothing we can't stop.

33:01.397 --> 33:02.512
All right, everyone...

33:02.606 --> 33:04.722
Good Times Glory
Hole Hour is over.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.103
Trust me, you don't know
what you're getting into

33:07.194 --> 33:08.650
or what's gotten
into you.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.819
You keep at this,
you're going to die.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.862
Anyone who's just had
relations with the thing

33:12.950 --> 33:15.236
in that room is going
to need a shot.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.865
[Murmurs]

33:18.956 --> 33:20.412
No, no!

33:20.499 --> 33:22.080
No, stay calm...
she's a professional!

33:22.168 --> 33:24.705
She gives
great needle!

33:24.795 --> 33:25.329
That's it.

33:25.379 --> 33:25.959
Oh, oh!

33:26.005 --> 33:27.040
Your asses are mine!

33:27.131 --> 33:29.087
Forget their asses.
Roman wants them dead.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.881
Take them
to the vat.

33:30.968 --> 33:33.926
Buddy, don't you
know the house rules?

33:34.805 --> 33:36.887
A girl doesn't give you
the go ahead...

33:36.974 --> 33:38.680
it's hands off.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.972
So, take your hands
off my girlfriend.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.812
Are you sure I can't
offer you fine officers

33:48.903 --> 33:50.439
a taste
of ambrosia?

33:53.157 --> 33:55.068
She's really
game for anything.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.695
I'll keep that in mind.

34:19.183 --> 34:19.933
Help!

34:19.975 --> 34:21.886
Help!
Please, help!

34:21.977 --> 34:24.935
[Crying]

34:25.022 --> 34:25.932
Help!

34:26.023 --> 34:26.808
Help!

34:26.857 --> 34:28.393
Drop the knife
or I'll snap her neck.

34:28.484 --> 34:29.724
How 'bout you
drop the doctor

34:29.818 --> 34:31.979
or | go Reservoir Dogs
on your ear!

34:32.071 --> 34:33.652
What about me?

34:36.367 --> 34:38.949
Kenzihawk down!
Kenzihawk down!

34:39.954 --> 34:41.285
Ain't that a shame.

34:41.372 --> 34:42.612
So, who you
wanna save?

34:42.706 --> 34:44.617
The prickly one,
or the puny one?

34:44.708 --> 34:46.960
Who says a girl's
gotta choose?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.923
Help! Help!

34:55.010 --> 34:55.999
I'm begging you!

34:56.095 --> 34:58.086
Let them out
of there, Roman.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.044
Oh, God!

34:59.139 --> 35:00.720
Come now,
what's all the fuss?

35:00.808 --> 35:02.093
|'m cleaning up
after myself.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.845
Yeah, what
about Graeme?

35:03.936 --> 35:06.052
He died right in front
of his own wife.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.853
He escaped before we could
get him in the holding tank.

35:08.941 --> 35:11.523
It was a minor slip-up
which we corrected.

35:12.987 --> 35:14.067
Let me out
of here!

35:14.154 --> 35:16.019
And we made sure
to scoop up his wife

35:16.115 --> 35:19.073
and girlfriend just in case
they were "affected" too.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.033
[Whoosh]

35:22.579 --> 35:23.489
Ugh!

35:23.580 --> 35:24.706
Ow!

35:27.793 --> 35:29.203
That was just
a warning.

35:31.588 --> 35:34.079
Leave now, and we'll forget
that you were ever here.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.505
What happened
to you, Roman?

35:35.592 --> 35:37.583
You used to be
such a fun guy.

35:37.678 --> 35:39.009
Over the centuries,
| indulged in

35:39.096 --> 35:41.883
so many sexual kinks
that eventually I grew numb

35:41.974 --> 35:43.714
to all
physical pleasure.

35:43.809 --> 35:44.889
Oh, boo hoo.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.717
A Bacchus who
cannot feel pleasure

35:46.812 --> 35:48.268
has no reason to live.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.016
But I found
a solution.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.563
| mated with a Manta.

35:51.942 --> 35:52.852
Hold up.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.604
You banged a sea cow?

35:55.070 --> 35:57.812
She transfers pleasure from
her constant stream of sex

35:57.906 --> 36:01.069
with all those eager humans
straight to my every neuron.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.910
That's very graphic.
Also illegal.

36:05.581 --> 36:06.866
It's all l have.

36:06.957 --> 36:08.993
And no one is
taking it from me.

36:20.012 --> 36:22.298
Now that gets me hot.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.713
Last chance.
Let her go.

36:24.808 --> 36:25.888
LAUREN:
A word of advice--

36:25.976 --> 36:27.887
You might want to
do what she says.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.263
Why would I do that?

36:29.355 --> 36:30.891
I've seen her
do this before...

36:30.981 --> 36:31.936
It ain't pretty.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.723
Enough.
To the vat!

36:35.944 --> 36:37.070
[Whack]

36:37.780 --> 36:38.860
What's happening!?

36:38.947 --> 36:41.279
She's kicking ass and
she's MY best friend!

36:41.367 --> 36:42.573
[Whack]

36:43.577 --> 36:44.692
[Whack]

36:44.787 --> 36:45.902
[Whack]

36:46.789 --> 36:47.995
[Whack]

36:48.374 --> 36:49.489
[Whack]

36:50.000 --> 36:51.115
[Whack]

36:52.002 --> 36:55.870
[Struggling]

36:55.964 --> 36:57.170
[Crash]

36:57.966 --> 36:58.876
LAUREN: Bo!

36:58.967 --> 36:59.877
Wait!

36:59.968 --> 37:01.879
That was seven
kinds of awesome!

37:01.970 --> 37:03.926
No, something
is really wrong.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.300
Bo!

37:05.391 --> 37:06.301
Stop!

37:06.392 --> 37:07.507
It's me.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.307
This isn't you.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.010
Just come back,
I'm right here.

37:11.105 --> 37:12.265
[Rawr]

37:12.356 --> 37:14.893
Whatever this is,
you have to fight it.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.070
Lauren?

37:19.154 --> 37:20.860
Yeah.
Yeah, honey, it's me.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.279
What is
happening to me?

37:22.366 --> 37:25.153
Everything's okay.
Just come back.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.200
I love you.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.127
Get out of my way.

37:40.008 --> 37:40.963
[Snarling]

37:43.095 --> 37:45.131
I loved you from
the second we met.

37:45.973 --> 37:49.465
We were alone and
my stethoscope was,

37:49.560 --> 37:51.300
probably cold, but...

37:51.937 --> 37:53.893
we touched.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.354
Honey, do you
remember?

38:01.363 --> 38:02.899
Do you remember
that first time?

38:02.990 --> 38:04.526
Just look at me.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.073
What have I done?

38:14.168 --> 38:15.749
Wha--?

38:20.257 --> 38:21.713
I'm fine.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.003
A little bored, but...

38:32.019 --> 38:33.054
Roman's dead.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.476
They shut down
the steam room

38:34.563 --> 38:36.724
and I treated all
the remaining humans.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.316
You think
they'll make it?

38:38.400 --> 38:41.267
Full recovery, without
any lasting effects.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.272
And without its hot,
humid environment--

38:43.363 --> 38:46.025
The Manta simply
shriveled up and died.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.781
You're good at
cleaning up messes.

38:48.869 --> 38:49.949
Some messes
clean up themselves.

38:50.037 --> 38:51.368
The humans were
so overwhelmed--

38:51.455 --> 38:52.991
I'm not talking
about them.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.284
Honey...

38:55.375 --> 38:57.707
You had nothing to do
with that girl's death.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.085
How can you be sure?

39:01.173 --> 39:02.504
Because I know you.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.252
And yes, you've been
particularly hungry

39:04.343 --> 39:06.049
this past while,
but with a regimen

39:06.136 --> 39:07.876
of small meals...

39:07.971 --> 39:10.348
You saw what
happened to me!

39:10.432 --> 39:11.888
It was an
emotional response--

39:11.975 --> 39:12.930
Lauren...

39:13.393 --> 39:14.348
Please.

39:15.354 --> 39:16.935
What was that?

39:17.773 --> 39:18.728
I don't know.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.266
But it's becoming more
and more obvious

39:22.361 --> 39:24.522
that you are a very
complex creature.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.104
What if I'm
a monster?

39:28.158 --> 39:30.695
None of those Fae
you hurt died.

39:30.786 --> 39:34.654
And I am still fine-tuning the
formula for your injections.

39:34.957 --> 39:36.913
We'll take it
one day at a time.

39:37.584 --> 39:38.539
Together.

39:42.589 --> 39:43.874
You're amazing.

39:44.967 --> 39:46.002
Yes, I am.

39:46.593 --> 39:47.628
[Laughing]

39:47.719 --> 39:51.553
Well, at least,
scientifically speaking.

39:51.974 --> 39:54.135
But from now on I don't
want to be involved

39:54.226 --> 39:57.263
in your extracurricular
activities.

39:57.354 --> 40:00.846
In fact, I don't want to know
any of the details whatsoever.

40:00.941 --> 40:03.683
ljust didn't want
you to feel left out.

40:03.777 --> 40:08.271
Actually, I would really
like to feel left out...

40:08.365 --> 40:09.605
of this one.

40:10.993 --> 40:11.948
You know what?

40:13.495 --> 40:15.451
Enough about feeding.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.912
How would you like
to have dinner?

40:18.792 --> 40:20.703
I mean, a real dinner.

40:20.794 --> 40:21.328
[Laughing]

40:21.378 --> 40:22.128
Hmm?

40:22.170 --> 40:23.751
Just me and you.

40:24.172 --> 40:27.084
Dr. Lewis, are you
asking me out on a date?

40:27.175 --> 40:28.255
Oh, well,
you know...

40:28.343 --> 40:30.299
One of the benefits
to being a physician is

40:30.387 --> 40:33.129
that every patient is
a potential tryst.

40:35.809 --> 40:38.016
Go.
Get ready.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.852
Pick me up
in an hour?

40:42.149 --> 40:44.265
--O kay.
--O kay.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.948
Bye.

41:05.005 --> 41:06.085
We need to talk.

41:07.591 --> 41:10.628
I think something's
very wrong with Bo.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.507
DYSON:
lnconclusive.

41:19.353 --> 41:20.968
lnconclusive.
There you go.

41:21.063 --> 41:22.849
Still no cause of death.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.351
Bo was pretty
worked up at the club.

41:25.442 --> 41:26.807
So I heard...

41:27.569 --> 41:28.354
Out of control.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.730
|f Lauren hadn't been there
to talk her down, she--

41:34.368 --> 41:35.858
But then, Lauren...

41:35.952 --> 41:37.408
Lauren what?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.325
Lauren would do
anything to protect Bo.

41:42.376 --> 41:43.912
Maybe even...

41:44.002 --> 41:45.663
Falsify an autopsy.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.290
|f Bo did kill our vic, maybe
she can't even remember it.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.091
So?

41:56.765 --> 41:58.471
So, I have
a job to do.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.978
I'm going to follow this
through to the end.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.249
Finally!

42:23.333 --> 42:25.710
The Terrible Twosome can
spend quality time together.

42:25.794 --> 42:28.911
With all the Thai food a
cloned credit card could buy.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.625
Well, it looks great,
Kenz...

42:31.717 --> 42:34.459
but I kinda have
dinner plans with Lauren.

42:34.553 --> 42:36.589
But eating's our thing.

42:37.347 --> 42:38.302
Come on.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.053
Have some
spicy noodles.

42:42.352 --> 42:43.728
Mm-mm-mm!

42:48.775 --> 42:49.810
Besides...

42:51.445 --> 42:53.060
I'm still
a little freaked.

42:55.365 --> 42:57.105
Tell me the truth,
Kenz.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.901
Is it possible that
I killed that girl?

43:01.997 --> 43:02.952
Maybe.

43:03.373 --> 43:06.991
Come on.
Open wide.

43:09.796 --> 43:11.172
You first, bestie.

43:12.007 --> 43:13.042
Okay.

43:14.968 --> 43:15.957
Mmm...

43:16.762 --> 43:17.592
Good?

43:17.679 --> 43:19.670
Mmm...
[Laughing]

43:19.765 --> 43:21.221
That is scrumptious!

43:23.977 --> 43:24.932
[Thud]

43:25.771 --> 43:27.682
And covered
in peanuts.

43:27.773 --> 43:30.264
To which you are
deathly allergic.

43:30.567 --> 43:32.273
So tell me, bitch...

43:32.360 --> 43:34.851
Where the hell is Kenzi?
