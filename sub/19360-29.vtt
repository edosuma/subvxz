00:07.200 --> 00:09.766
This week, on the season finale of Vice:

00:09.802 --> 00:13.104
the dramatic fall of ISIS in Iraq.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.846
He just got shot through the shin,

00:22.882 --> 00:24.948
running across this... this street.

00:24.984 --> 00:27.385
And then, the child soldiers

00:27.420 --> 00:29.420
ISIS left behind.

00:29.455 --> 00:31.722
How many other boys were you with?

00:33.393 --> 00:34.925
All your age?

00:42.621 --> 00:44.868
Do you think that he'll
ever be able to forget

00:44.904 --> 00:46.603
what he's been through?

00:54.446 --> 00:55.879
Go, go, go!

00:58.551 --> 01:00.216
We are not animals!

01:11.697 --> 01:14.064
Ever since ISIS first swept across Syria

01:14.099 --> 01:15.498
and Iraq three years ago,

01:15.534 --> 01:18.268
they have dominated the
international news cycle.

01:18.303 --> 01:21.772
And over the last ten months,
they have faded from headlines,

01:21.807 --> 01:25.508
as they continue to lose
physical territory in the region,

01:25.544 --> 01:28.278
including where they first
declared the caliphate,

01:28.313 --> 01:30.380
Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul.

01:30.415 --> 01:33.783
For the past year, Vice
has been on the ground,

01:33.818 --> 01:35.552
reporting on what actually happens

01:35.587 --> 01:37.653
as the caliphate fails.

03:47.203 --> 03:49.751
So, we've been told that at least
two soldiers were killed today

03:49.786 --> 03:52.887
and were just carried out,
and dozens were injured.

03:54.657 --> 03:57.458
The battle for Mosul
lasted almost a year.

03:57.493 --> 04:00.228
Its outcome will have
global repercussions,

04:00.263 --> 04:03.865
defining the future of Iraq and ISIS.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.767
It's the biggest city
in their territory,

04:05.802 --> 04:08.402
and ISIS held it for three years.

04:08.438 --> 04:10.038
Someone who knows this all too well

04:10.073 --> 04:11.706
is Dr. David Kilcullen,

04:11.742 --> 04:13.274
the former senior advisor

04:13.309 --> 04:14.475
to General David Petraeus

04:14.510 --> 04:17.745
and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.147
The Battle of Mosul is...

04:20.182 --> 04:22.250
the largest urban battle

04:22.285 --> 04:25.219
that we've seen anywhere on the
planet since the Second World War.

04:25.255 --> 04:27.688
And I think people will be studying

04:27.724 --> 04:31.024
what happens when you fight a modern war

04:31.060 --> 04:33.861
with satellites and
drones and smart phones

04:33.896 --> 04:36.430
and IEDs, in an ancient city

04:36.466 --> 04:38.999
that still has 1.2 million
people living in it.

05:01.890 --> 05:03.890
What are the ISIS fighters saying

05:03.925 --> 05:06.426
to people who might want to flee?

05:16.571 --> 05:18.171
And they would do this
in front of everybody,

05:18.206 --> 05:19.639
even in front of the children?

05:29.984 --> 05:32.151
We rejoined the Iraqi security forces

05:32.187 --> 05:35.221
as they prepared for the final
push against ISIS in Western Mosul.

05:40.528 --> 05:42.093
As they moved forwards,

05:42.129 --> 05:44.095
clearing one building at a time,

05:44.131 --> 05:45.997
terrified families fled,

05:46.033 --> 05:48.166
knowing they could be
killed at any moment.

07:09.616 --> 07:12.583
It's just... shells like
that are just landing...

07:12.619 --> 07:14.519
sometimes every few minutes.

07:14.554 --> 07:17.254
This is what clearing
an area looks like.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.891
Not only is there not a building
that's not pretty much destroyed,

07:19.926 --> 07:21.893
there's not even a window or a door

07:21.928 --> 07:24.662
that isn't completely destroyed.

07:24.697 --> 07:26.898
So you can imagine what it's like

07:26.933 --> 07:30.267
for the something like 200,000 civilians

07:30.303 --> 07:33.438
who are living in the
Old City over there.

07:39.913 --> 07:43.814
So this is... as far forward
as they've been so far.

07:43.849 --> 07:46.483
And it's not far from
here to the Old City,

07:46.518 --> 07:48.084
which is probably where ISIS

07:48.119 --> 07:49.753
is gonna be forced to make their,

07:49.788 --> 07:50.754
their last stand.

07:50.789 --> 07:53.523
So they're really
trapped in a very, very...

07:53.559 --> 07:54.991
small area now.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.833
The sniper, who pushed them back,

08:38.870 --> 08:41.068
is now getting shots into this building,

08:41.105 --> 08:43.438
which is their base.
This is where they sleep.

08:47.177 --> 08:51.312
So, they're now having to circle
around the back of their own base

08:51.347 --> 08:55.316
to, um, avoid the sniper fire.
That's a seriously bad sign.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.334
Oh!

09:15.572 --> 09:18.573
That was the airstrike they've been
calling for for about the last hour.

09:18.608 --> 09:21.743
I think it hit the school, where they
think there were ten ISIS fighters

09:21.778 --> 09:25.513
who were the ones who were shooting
very actively down the street.

09:25.548 --> 09:28.449
They were saying that
once the airstrike hit,

09:28.484 --> 09:30.884
they were gonna then storm the school.

10:38.852 --> 10:41.886
Amidst the chaos, the Iraqi
soldier who fired the rocket

10:41.922 --> 10:44.189
has killed three of his own men.

12:05.787 --> 12:07.620
Every day was the same.

12:07.656 --> 12:09.356
The fighting never stopped,

12:09.391 --> 12:11.558
and the soldiers barely slept.

12:55.636 --> 12:58.737
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

13:39.279 --> 13:41.346
The plan now is to clear

13:41.381 --> 13:43.248
all of these buildings up to the river.

13:43.283 --> 13:45.950
And that would cut off the
hospital from the Old City.

13:45.985 --> 13:49.187
Take the hospital, and then
all that's left of the Old City.

16:30.313 --> 16:33.213
But there was a church and
a mosque side-by-side here?

16:56.404 --> 16:59.639
So this is the... the
Tigris River just here.

16:59.674 --> 17:01.308
There's an Iraqi flag in front of us.

17:01.343 --> 17:03.009
Another Iraqi flag here.

17:03.045 --> 17:04.676
So, they've... they've made it,

17:04.713 --> 17:06.607
they've pushed all the way to the river,

17:06.944 --> 17:09.175
and separated the
hospital from the Old City,

17:09.196 --> 17:11.729
which means however many
fighters are left in the hospital

17:11.778 --> 17:13.685
are now cut off and
completely surrounded.

17:13.722 --> 17:16.531
So it's taking much longer
than everyone thought.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.691
It's much harder than everyone thought,

17:18.727 --> 17:22.246
but very slowly, bit by
bit, building by building,

17:23.397 --> 17:26.531
they're, uh, they're taking Mosul.

17:30.071 --> 17:32.672
The prime minister came
sounding triumphant.

17:32.707 --> 17:35.775
In the heart of a free and
liberated Mosul, he said:

17:35.810 --> 17:38.310
"We announce absolute victory."

17:40.715 --> 17:42.515
What was the cost to Mosul, the city,

17:42.550 --> 17:44.316
and the civilian population of Mosul?

17:44.352 --> 17:47.119
There are still bodies under the
rubble in some parts of the city.

17:47.154 --> 17:49.154
There's, if you like, a societal level

17:49.190 --> 17:50.956
of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

17:50.992 --> 17:52.892
of people there that lived through ISIS

17:52.927 --> 17:54.660
and then lived through the fighting,

17:54.696 --> 17:56.729
and now are going back and
trying to rebuild their lives.

17:56.765 --> 17:59.565
If, you know, key leaders are killed,

17:59.601 --> 18:02.501
and if key terrain is held
by the Iraqi security forces,

18:02.686 --> 18:04.485
what do you think ISIS becomes?

18:04.521 --> 18:06.588
This is the point at which
we need to be asking ourselves

18:06.623 --> 18:08.389
whether there's a better
way, or a different way.

18:08.425 --> 18:11.426
I mean, we've been fighting
these guys for 15 years.

18:11.461 --> 18:13.028
Hundreds of billions of dollars,

18:13.063 --> 18:14.395
if not trillions of
dollars, into the fight.

18:14.431 --> 18:18.567
We've lost 8,000 people just
from the US military alone.

18:18.602 --> 18:21.335
Probably half a million civilians
have been killed in that time,

18:21.371 --> 18:23.638
and now we are dealing with not one,

18:23.674 --> 18:26.407
but two global terrorist organizations,

18:26.443 --> 18:29.544
each of which is as big
as Al Qaeda was on 9/11.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.312
Do you think we've made the situation,

18:31.347 --> 18:33.381
not just worse, but twice as bad?

18:33.416 --> 18:35.183
At least twice as bad. We now have,

18:35.218 --> 18:38.419
groups that are operating in
something like 70 countries.

18:38.455 --> 18:41.554
We've got a really
significant threat in Europe

18:41.588 --> 18:43.424
which didn't exist on 9/11.

18:43.460 --> 18:46.127
I don't think we're gonna
deal effectively with this

18:46.162 --> 18:47.595
in a matter of months or years.

18:47.630 --> 18:50.464
This is a generational thing, and
I know it's depressing to say that,

18:50.499 --> 18:53.233
but I think we're probably
closer to the beginning

18:53.268 --> 18:54.867
than we are to the end.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.209
ISIS has lost the
physical battle in Mosul,

19:02.244 --> 19:04.444
but the hardest part
may have just begun.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.914
Because now, as ISIS and
other extremist groups

19:07.949 --> 19:12.219
splinter and diffuse into
international terrorist organizations,

19:12.254 --> 19:13.953
there is a growing concern

19:13.989 --> 19:15.688
that a larger problem is at hand,

19:15.724 --> 19:18.191
as people who were
indoctrinated by the group,

19:18.227 --> 19:19.726
especially children,

19:19.761 --> 19:22.095
are now re-entering society.

19:22.131 --> 19:24.896
Isobel Yeung went to report
on this burgeoning story

19:24.932 --> 19:28.367
in the aftermath of the
fall of ISIS in Iraq.

19:38.979 --> 19:41.880
The city of Mosul has been liberated,

19:41.915 --> 19:45.717
but rebuilding remains an enormous task.

19:45.753 --> 19:47.486
We sat down with Governor Hammadi,

19:47.522 --> 19:50.055
who's responsible for
this entire province,

19:50.090 --> 19:53.559
and whose job it is to oversee
the reconstruction efforts.

19:53.594 --> 19:55.694
What is the situation
in Mosul right now?

20:29.596 --> 20:33.464
Finding these ISIS
sympathizers is a daunting task.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.699
The fighting has caused

20:34.734 --> 20:36.500
mass displacement
throughout the country,

20:36.535 --> 20:38.569
with the Battle of Mosul alone

20:38.604 --> 20:40.404
forcing almost one million Iraqis

20:40.439 --> 20:42.005
to flee their homes.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.575
Thousands more continue to seek refuge.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.578
These guys have just arrived
in the camp from Tal Afar,

20:47.613 --> 20:49.879
which is an ISIS-controlled area nearby.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.548
This is one of several IDP camps

20:51.584 --> 20:53.317
that have been set up in
the last couple of months

20:53.352 --> 20:56.520
to deal with the huge
influx of people arriving

20:56.555 --> 20:59.389
from ISIS-controlled
areas all around here.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.091
A lot of the children and
a lot of their families

21:01.126 --> 21:04.026
have lived under ISIS
control for several years.

21:04.061 --> 21:08.063
Many of these children
exhibit signs of PTSD

21:08.099 --> 21:11.400
after spending their formative
years growing up under ISIS.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.603
Like this 15-year-old,
who agreed to speak with us

21:13.638 --> 21:15.971
under the condition
that we hid his identity

21:16.006 --> 21:19.007
for fear of ISIS
retaliation within the camp.

21:19.043 --> 21:20.476
Do you remember what it was like

21:20.511 --> 21:22.645
when Daesh first got to your town?

21:41.633 --> 21:43.399
You watched that happening?

21:52.042 --> 21:54.640
How did you feel when you
were watching those things?

22:02.653 --> 22:04.119
Did they ever try to...

22:04.155 --> 22:06.621
convince you to go to their schools,

22:06.657 --> 22:08.670
or to go to their training camps?

22:24.040 --> 22:27.642
This is a crucial part of ISIS strategy.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.778
They recruit so-called
"Cubs of the Caliphate"

22:29.813 --> 22:32.046
to train and fight with them.

22:32.081 --> 22:34.982
And most importantly,
for the next generation

22:35.018 --> 22:37.519
to be ready to support
and spread the ideology

22:37.554 --> 22:39.287
of the Islamic State.

22:39.323 --> 22:41.723
We met Dr. Anne
Speckhard, a psychologist

22:41.758 --> 22:43.692
and director of the International Center

22:43.727 --> 22:45.493
for the Study of Violent Extremism,

22:45.529 --> 22:47.429
who has interviewed
hundreds of terrorists

22:47.464 --> 22:49.764
around the world and in Iraq.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.398
The government of Iraq

22:51.434 --> 22:53.567
says that there's half-a-million youth

22:53.602 --> 22:55.369
that lived in ISIS territories.

22:55.404 --> 22:57.538
The half-million youth

22:57.573 --> 23:00.040
probably have been exposed
to a lot of violence.

23:00.075 --> 23:01.742
ISIS were the only people

23:01.777 --> 23:04.478
that continued to send
their kids to school.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.381
In the schools we had the ISIS ideology,

23:07.416 --> 23:10.718
we had kids learning how to behead.

23:18.020 --> 23:20.594
There were at least 5,000 Iraqi kids

23:20.629 --> 23:22.229
that were in the Cubs of the Caliphate,

23:22.264 --> 23:24.130
and if they went into
the Cubs of the Caliphate,

23:24.166 --> 23:26.867
they were indoctrinated
to be suicide bombers,

23:26.902 --> 23:28.935
to be so-called martyrs.

23:28.971 --> 23:31.704
ISIS, more than any other group,

23:31.740 --> 23:35.375
was really good at cult indoctrination.

23:35.410 --> 23:37.577
It is an overwhelming and daunting task,

23:37.612 --> 23:39.312
to address this entire generation

23:39.348 --> 23:41.714
that lived under ISIS.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.917
Many of the so-called
Cubs of the Caliphate

23:43.952 --> 23:45.518
are currently being detained.

23:45.553 --> 23:46.686
Salaam.

23:46.721 --> 23:48.021
We visited one of the prisons

23:48.056 --> 23:50.991
where suspected ISIS
members are being held.

23:57.098 --> 23:59.798
Access to these cells
is highly restricted,

23:59.833 --> 24:03.002
so we filmed covertly to
show the conditions inside.

24:03.042 --> 24:07.306
Are you guys sleeping
and living in here?

24:10.945 --> 24:13.205
Are there any kids in here?

24:25.226 --> 24:27.259
This final room we visited was so dark,

24:27.295 --> 24:28.827
it can't fully be seen here,

24:28.862 --> 24:32.564
but it contained more than a hundred
people, who were so tightly packed

24:32.599 --> 24:35.900
that they had to stand or
sit hugging their knees.

24:44.062 --> 24:46.514
What are you all here for?

24:52.730 --> 24:55.526
How long have you guys been in here for?

25:00.093 --> 25:02.260
We were permitted to
film with a child soldier,

25:02.295 --> 25:03.594
who joined ISIS at 13,

25:03.629 --> 25:06.964
and who's been locked away
here for the last two months.

25:25.130 --> 25:26.961
Why were you arrested?

25:54.750 --> 25:57.070
How many other boys were you with?

26:00.251 --> 26:02.251
And they were all your age?

26:23.674 --> 26:25.707
Do you understand why

26:25.743 --> 26:28.176
so many of your fellow Iraqis

26:28.211 --> 26:29.578
would never want you

26:29.613 --> 26:32.169
to come back into Iraqi society?

26:32.289 --> 26:35.283
They're scared that you're
a threat to the community.

26:59.475 --> 27:02.142
We saw the scale of
destruction firsthand

27:02.178 --> 27:04.011
when we visited what was the epicenter

27:04.047 --> 27:06.380
of ISIS' stronghold in Iraq.

27:06.415 --> 27:08.115
We're just entering
the Old City of Mosul

27:08.150 --> 27:09.784
with the civilian defense unit.

27:09.819 --> 27:11.418
All these guys in the back of this van

27:11.454 --> 27:13.387
are searching for their family members,

27:13.422 --> 27:14.889
as they have been for the last few days.

27:42.151 --> 27:43.783
Wow.

28:29.806 --> 28:31.997
Oh, my gosh.

28:44.345 --> 28:46.097
Whoa. What happened?

28:50.317 --> 28:52.234
Who... Who shot him?

28:55.990 --> 28:58.766
Were there any Daesh people
living in this neighborhood?

29:12.807 --> 29:14.731
You're not gonna move
the bodies of Daesh?

29:44.738 --> 29:46.871
This poor kid is just desperately trying

29:46.906 --> 29:49.807
to make sense of this pile of rubble,

29:49.843 --> 29:53.277
searching for his father and his sister,

29:53.312 --> 29:55.479
that are somewhere amongst this.

30:38.523 --> 30:41.357
For the millions of people
who lived under ISIS,

30:41.393 --> 30:43.559
they faced horrific suffering.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.995
Now, many Iraqis

30:46.030 --> 30:48.931
are understandably hungry for revenge.

30:48.966 --> 30:51.601
So, what was this like
when ISIS was here?

31:07.451 --> 31:10.036
Did you lose any family
members while ISIS was here?

31:24.668 --> 31:26.149
Do you know what happened to him?

31:52.941 --> 31:55.152
Are there many ISIS
families living here?

32:08.711 --> 32:10.811
Sorry, one second.

32:18.053 --> 32:19.801
Who is this guy?

32:28.330 --> 32:30.598
Fear and suspicion are rampant

32:30.633 --> 32:32.700
over who may or may not be

32:32.735 --> 32:35.603
an ISIS sympathizer,
or even a sleeper cell.

32:35.638 --> 32:37.471
Anyone who was involved with the group

32:37.507 --> 32:41.108
is now a potential
target of retaliation.

32:41.143 --> 32:42.676
At the age of 14,

32:42.712 --> 32:45.880
this boy says he attended an ISIS
training camp for just over a month,

32:45.915 --> 32:47.815
and then spent the next several years

32:47.850 --> 32:49.583
hiding from them.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.018
When his city was liberated,

32:51.053 --> 32:53.653
he told us that Iraqi
authorities captured him,

32:53.688 --> 32:55.588
later releasing him from prison

32:55.624 --> 32:57.657
and clearing him of all charges.

32:57.692 --> 33:01.728
But the stigma of being a Cub
of the Caliphate is lasting.

33:01.763 --> 33:04.697
He now continues to live in hiding.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.934
What I don't understand is that

33:06.969 --> 33:09.669
you'd heard about Daesh
before they got here.

33:09.704 --> 33:11.571
You were scared of them.

33:11.606 --> 33:14.207
They came here, they
took over your town,

33:14.243 --> 33:15.675
they closed your schools.

33:15.710 --> 33:19.313
And yet you still wanted to join them.

33:19.348 --> 33:20.981
Can you explain that?

33:55.984 --> 33:59.352
You're now not welcome
in your own hometown.

33:59.387 --> 34:02.286
Do you feel angry at
all about that situation,

34:02.323 --> 34:05.157
and about people not wanting you here?

34:23.878 --> 34:26.578
These fears are not unfounded.

34:33.721 --> 34:35.920
We met with the family
of a village elder

34:35.956 --> 34:38.356
who was murdered just days earlier.

34:38.391 --> 34:40.925
While we can't confirm that
it was a revenge attack,

34:40.960 --> 34:43.094
we were told that his
sons are imprisoned

34:43.130 --> 34:45.330
for alleged affiliations with ISIS,

34:45.364 --> 34:49.034
and he himself advocated
that former ISIS families

34:49.069 --> 34:51.702
be reintegrated back into the community.

34:59.413 --> 35:01.812
I heard that your husband
was quite outspoken,

35:01.848 --> 35:03.948
because he was saying
that Daesh families

35:03.983 --> 35:05.350
should be welcomed back.

35:05.385 --> 35:08.630
Do you think that that is
maybe why he was targeted?

35:42.288 --> 35:45.456
Some of these children are
now returning to their families

35:45.491 --> 35:47.123
after years apart.

35:47.158 --> 35:48.157
Hi, buddy.

35:48.193 --> 35:50.994
We visited Tomas, an
11-year-old Yazidi boy

35:51.029 --> 35:54.230
who was rescued from
ISIS three weeks earlier.

35:54.265 --> 35:57.100
The Yazidis are an ethnic
and religious minority

35:57.135 --> 35:58.868
despised by ISIS.

35:58.904 --> 36:00.704
They executed thousands of them,

36:00.739 --> 36:02.706
took women and girls as sex slaves,

36:02.741 --> 36:05.075
and kidnapped young
boys to fight for them,

36:05.110 --> 36:08.311
all of which the UN says
amounts to a genocide.

36:08.346 --> 36:11.214
Is this the first family
meal since he got back?

36:22.760 --> 36:24.660
When Tomas was just eight years old,

36:24.695 --> 36:27.395
a group of ISIS fighters
stopped his family's car.

36:29.036 --> 36:30.298
I win.

36:30.334 --> 36:32.901
They kidnapped him, his
sisters, and his cousins,

36:32.937 --> 36:36.304
and he spent the next three
years being forced to fight.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.706
How did you hurt yourself?

36:45.999 --> 36:49.103
That must have been really
scary. Were you scared?

37:13.743 --> 37:15.977
Do you think that he'll
ever be able to forget

37:16.012 --> 37:17.488
what he's been through?

37:19.583 --> 37:22.217
Are you getting any support
at all from the government?

37:22.252 --> 37:25.753
Or is Tomas getting any
kind of psychosocial support?

37:25.789 --> 37:28.523
Any rehabilitation programs
that are available to him?

37:36.034 --> 37:37.933
There's a lot of Iraqi people

37:37.961 --> 37:40.434
who don't feel very comfortable

37:40.469 --> 37:43.204
with children like Tomas,

37:43.239 --> 37:47.140
who has been living under
ISIS and training under ISIS

37:47.176 --> 37:49.076
for the last three years,

37:49.111 --> 37:52.313
to be back in Iraqi society.

37:52.348 --> 37:54.377
Is that a concern of yours at all?

38:09.097 --> 38:11.231
We now have an entire generation

38:11.266 --> 38:14.934
that's grown up knowing nothing but war.

38:14.969 --> 38:17.470
The turmoil we witnessed
is a painful legacy

38:17.505 --> 38:20.740
of the power vacuum
created by the Iraq war.

38:20.775 --> 38:22.942
When we look at Iraq,
we have to remember

38:22.977 --> 38:25.811
that we have an entire
society that's traumatized.

38:25.847 --> 38:29.716
They've lived through war since 2003.

38:30.849 --> 38:33.427
Before that, they were
living under Saddam.

38:33.461 --> 38:36.955
If we treat the kids that
could be rehabilitated,

38:36.990 --> 38:39.958
we'll see less likelihood
of ISIS re-emerging.

38:39.993 --> 38:42.527
This is a problem that you
can't kill your way out of.

38:42.563 --> 38:45.196
With ISIS now on the verge of defeat,

38:45.232 --> 38:46.698
a new void exists.

38:46.734 --> 38:48.467
What do you think
your future looks like?

38:59.479 --> 39:01.111
Until desperately needed

39:01.147 --> 39:03.414
rehabilitation programs are established,

39:03.449 --> 39:05.849
exposure to radical ideologies

39:05.885 --> 39:07.217
and violence

39:07.253 --> 39:08.753
leave the youth of Iraq

39:08.788 --> 39:11.188
more vulnerable than ever before.
