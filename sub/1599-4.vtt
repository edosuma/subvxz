WEBVTT

00:00.352 --> 00:01.351
<i>Coaching the glee club,</i>

00:01.353 --> 00:02.719
<i>And will's coaching</i>
<i>vocal adrenaline,</i>

00:02.721 --> 00:03.953
<i>And blaine's coaching</i>
<i>the warblers,</i>

00:03.955 --> 00:04.954
<i>And even sam's back,</i>
<i>coaching football.</i>

00:04.956 --> 00:06.189
Shut up! I know!

00:06.191 --> 00:07.790
<i>But the new directions!</i>
<i>Only have four members,</i>

00:07.792 --> 00:09.225
<i>And they need 12</i>
<i>for sectionals,</i>

00:09.227 --> 00:10.593
<i>And it seems like the new kids</i>
<i>are nice and stuff</i>

00:10.595 --> 00:12.562
<i>And maybe can sing, but it's</i>
<i>like, "wait, who are you?"</i>

00:12.564 --> 00:13.730
<i>Kurt and blaine</i>
<i>are still broken up,</i>

00:13.732 --> 00:14.931
<i>And kurt's not really dating,</i>

00:14.933 --> 00:16.099
<i>But blaine definitely</i>
<i>is dating,</i>

00:16.101 --> 00:17.967
<i>And the guy he's dating</i>
<i>is karofsky,</i>

00:17.969 --> 00:19.202
<i>So, like, ouch.</i>

00:19.204 --> 00:20.770
I'm hoping we can be friends.

00:20.772 --> 00:22.038
(wry laugh):
Oh, sounds like fun.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.706
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> glee.

00:25.443 --> 00:28.311
I mean, who would have thought
that after all these years,

00:28.313 --> 00:29.912
You and i would be friends?

00:29.914 --> 00:31.948
Sue:
<i>Now that i've achieved my goal</i>

00:31.950 --> 00:33.883
<i>Of absolute power</i>
<i>at this school,</i>

00:33.885 --> 00:35.652
<i>I figured,</i>
<i>what could be the harm</i>

00:35.654 --> 00:37.720
<i>In inviting will schuester</i>
<i>to a polite,</i>

00:37.722 --> 00:41.891
<i>Civil luncheon to bury</i>
<i>the hatchet once and for all.</i>

00:41.893 --> 00:45.228
(distorted, slowed-down):
Uh, it's great being back here,
you know...

00:45.230 --> 00:46.796
Sue:
<i>He surrendered the glee club</i>

00:46.798 --> 00:49.098
<i>And fled to another school,</i>
<i>after all,</i>

00:49.100 --> 00:52.502
<i>Which means will schuester</i>
<i>is no longer my mortal enemy.</i>

00:52.504 --> 00:54.671
I parked in my old spot...
(chuckles)

00:54.673 --> 00:56.906
Those little scrape marks
on the asphalt.

00:56.908 --> 00:58.908
Ah, remember that old muffler?

00:58.910 --> 01:01.978
Sue:
<i>Sure, the sound of will's voice</i>
<i>is like listening</i>

01:01.980 --> 01:04.614
<i>To brian boitano figure skate</i>
<i>across a chalkboard</i>

01:04.616 --> 01:06.649
<i>While rubbing together</i>
<i>the styrofoam</i>

01:06.651 --> 01:09.519
<i>His tom of finland ball gag</i>
<i>came packaged in.</i>

01:09.521 --> 01:11.854
I bought danny this little,
uh, toy piano,

01:11.856 --> 01:13.656
And, uh, i sing
"don't stop believing" to him

01:13.658 --> 01:15.491
Every night
before he goes to bed.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.527
<i>Clearly, he has some sort</i>
<i>of disorder</i>

01:17.529 --> 01:19.529
<i>That gives him</i>
<i>the emotional depth</i>

01:19.531 --> 01:20.997
<i>Of a 12-year-old girl.</i>
<i>Maybe</i> that's<i> why</i>

01:20.999 --> 01:22.665
<i>He doesn't have</i>
<i>any adult friends.</i>

01:22.667 --> 01:25.968
<i>Oh, will schuester,</i>
<i>you poor, maudlin imbecile,</i>

01:25.970 --> 01:27.603
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

01:27.605 --> 01:29.806
Anything that
ever really matters in life...

01:29.808 --> 01:31.874
I learned in that glee club.

01:31.876 --> 01:34.210
<i>I pity you.</i>

01:34.212 --> 01:35.611
Oh, yikes, look at the time.

01:35.613 --> 01:37.814
It's been really great
talking to you, sue.

01:37.816 --> 01:39.182
Um... I got to go.

01:39.184 --> 01:41.050
And i thank you.

01:43.888 --> 01:46.622
(sighs)

01:46.624 --> 01:48.991
(dramatic musical stinger)

01:48.993 --> 01:50.893
<i>That son of a whore.</i>

01:50.895 --> 01:53.563
<i>How dare he insult me</i>
<i>like this.</i>

01:53.565 --> 01:56.466
<i>What kind of a psychopath</i>
<i>refuses to dispose</i>

01:56.468 --> 01:58.701
<i>Of an unused</i>
<i>plastic lunch fork</i>

01:58.703 --> 02:00.536
<i>And just leave it</i>
<i>sitting there?</i>

02:00.538 --> 02:03.139
<i>I will not clean up after you.</i>

02:03.141 --> 02:05.641
<i>Who do you think i am,</i>
<i>your maid?</i>

02:05.643 --> 02:08.311
<i>This is an outrage,</i>
<i>and it will not stand.</i>

02:08.313 --> 02:12.382
<i>Will schuester, you have</i>
<i>crossed me for the last time.</i>

02:22.594 --> 02:25.194
You know, becky,
i was thinking about retiring.

02:25.196 --> 02:26.396
What?!

02:26.398 --> 02:28.898
I got a sweet deal
on some marshland

02:28.900 --> 02:30.900
Down in southern iraq.

02:30.902 --> 02:33.536
(sighs)
but now i realize i can't rest

02:33.538 --> 02:36.606
Until i tie up some loose ends.

02:39.878 --> 02:42.278
What is this
place, coach?

02:42.280 --> 02:45.615
This is where i store
my hatred, becky...

02:45.617 --> 02:49.519
And where i'll prepare
my final act of revenge.

02:49.521 --> 02:51.754
I call it
my "hurt locker."

02:59.464 --> 03:02.598
Sue:
<i>Some people would find</i>
<i>multiple vendettas exhausting.</i>

03:02.600 --> 03:04.400
<i>But for sue sylvester,</i>

03:04.402 --> 03:06.702
<i>It's pure exhilaration.</i>

03:08.606 --> 03:10.373
<i>Will schuester,</i>

03:10.375 --> 03:13.709
<i>I will annihilate you</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

03:13.711 --> 03:18.147
<i>Then onto his self-obsessed</i>
<i>protégé, rachel berry.</i>

03:18.149 --> 03:20.616
<i>I'm going to break her heart.</i>

03:20.618 --> 03:21.651
Becky,

03:21.653 --> 03:22.985
Wait in the le car.

03:22.987 --> 03:24.353
(clicks tongue)

03:29.894 --> 03:32.462
<i>But first...</i>

03:33.431 --> 03:35.264
(strikes cacophonous chord)

03:35.266 --> 03:37.266
(whirring)

03:37.268 --> 03:39.001
<i>Klaine.</i>

03:39.003 --> 03:43.406
<i>I've been quietly shaping them</i>
<i>since they first met.</i>

03:43.408 --> 03:45.975
<i>Apart, they're so shrill,</i>
<i>so whiny.</i>

03:45.977 --> 03:47.777
<i>But together,</i>

03:47.779 --> 03:51.414
<i>A symphony</i>
<i>of self-congratulatory sodomy.</i>

03:51.416 --> 03:55.351
<i>I believed their tender</i>
<i>man-love was for the ages.</i>

03:55.353 --> 03:59.655
<i>And when they broke up,</i>
<i>i was... Devastated!</i>

03:59.657 --> 04:01.157
<i>Why?!</i>

04:01.159 --> 04:03.359
<i>They seemed to be doing</i>
<i>so well, and...</i>

04:03.361 --> 04:05.161
<i>Then suddenly it's over?</i>

04:05.163 --> 04:07.697
<i>I hereby pledge</i>
<i>to do whatever it takes</i>

04:07.699 --> 04:09.699
<i>To get them back together</i>

04:09.701 --> 04:11.968
<i>And achieve my ultimate goal--</i>

04:11.970 --> 04:15.104
<i>To be flower girl</i>
<i>at their fabulous gay wedding.</i>

04:15.106 --> 04:17.373
<i>Just hang on, porcelain.</i>

04:17.375 --> 04:19.842
<i>Help is on the way.</i>

04:25.783 --> 04:27.683
(bell rings)
oh, porcelain,

04:27.685 --> 04:29.051
My sweet, shrill,

04:29.053 --> 04:31.687
Fragile gelfling, i want
to help you achieve

04:31.689 --> 04:34.357
Your life's true purpose.

04:34.359 --> 04:36.859
I want to help you
get blaine back.

04:36.861 --> 04:39.061
Oh, that karofsky
character

04:39.063 --> 04:41.497
Is a grade-a no-goodnik;
he's a heartless bully.

04:41.499 --> 04:43.900
Since when have you cared
about me and blaine?

04:43.902 --> 04:45.635
Since, like,<i> forever.</i>

04:45.637 --> 04:48.671
You see, you and
blaine are blouses.

04:48.673 --> 04:50.706
What are blouses?
A blouse

04:50.708 --> 04:51.974
Is a breezy, femmy top.

04:51.976 --> 04:54.677
It's a term i coined for
my favorite type of gay.

04:54.679 --> 04:56.846
You always know where
you stand with a blouse.

04:56.848 --> 04:59.015
And they can't
sneak up on you,

04:59.017 --> 05:02.652
Because for miles, you can
hear their gentle swish,

05:02.654 --> 05:05.721
Swish, swish on
the summer wind.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.057
Uh, thank you, i-i guess,

05:08.059 --> 05:11.093
But i-i do not want to get
back together with blaine.

05:12.063 --> 05:13.863
Listen to you.

05:13.865 --> 05:16.232
That's not the porcelain i know.

05:17.569 --> 05:19.435
Now you better get
to the auditorium.

05:19.437 --> 05:20.836
The teams have arrived

05:20.838 --> 05:22.939
To rehearse on stage
for the invitational.

05:22.941 --> 05:24.073
What invitational?

05:24.075 --> 05:25.608
The one i organized

05:25.610 --> 05:28.544
To destroy the glee club
once and for all.

05:28.546 --> 05:31.581
I said that
out loud, didn't i?

05:31.583 --> 05:33.783
I should have said
that in voice-over.

05:33.785 --> 05:36.852
(percussion playing,
indistinct chatter)

05:38.957 --> 05:41.557
Sue really blindsided us
with this invitational.

05:41.559 --> 05:44.927
So how does it feel to be back,
but on the visiting team?

05:44.929 --> 05:47.697
Uh, i'm just glad it's in
such a low-stress environment.

05:47.699 --> 05:50.232
I mean, it's basically
an organized practice.

05:50.234 --> 05:51.734
That's the thing.

05:51.736 --> 05:53.202
It isn't for<i> my</i> kids.

05:53.204 --> 05:55.071
Do you remember our
first week of glee club,

05:55.073 --> 05:57.039
When you took us to carmel
to see vocal adrenaline

05:57.041 --> 06:00.242
And they were as great as
your team is probably gonna be?

06:00.244 --> 06:01.811
(chuckles):
How could i forget?

06:01.813 --> 06:03.913
I thought half of you were
gonna quit afterwards.

06:03.915 --> 06:06.916
Yeah, well, the reason
why we didn't was because
we were so committed

06:06.918 --> 06:08.551
To what you were doing.
Yeah.

06:08.553 --> 06:10.586
My kids aren't there yet.
They haven't bonded.

06:10.588 --> 06:12.655
They don't realize how important
what it is they're doing.

06:12.657 --> 06:14.724
If they see you guys
killing these numbers

06:14.726 --> 06:16.258
You've had all summer
to perfect, well,

06:16.260 --> 06:18.594
Then they're gonna lose
any sliver of hope they have,

06:18.596 --> 06:19.762
And the glee club'll
be dead here.

06:19.764 --> 06:22.398
Are you asking me
to throw the invitational?

06:22.400 --> 06:25.635
Rachel:
Look.. I-i'm not asking you

06:25.637 --> 06:27.303
To blow a competition--
you said it yourself,

06:27.305 --> 06:29.271
It's not that big of a deal.
Look, i know that you're

06:29.273 --> 06:31.273
A teacher at carmel now,
but this is your home--

06:31.275 --> 06:32.608
Don't you want
to protect your home?

06:32.610 --> 06:34.644
Will (over radio):
I'll think about it, rachel.

06:34.646 --> 06:37.013
I really would do anything
for you, rachel, you know that.

06:37.015 --> 06:38.481
But it's not
about that anymore.

06:38.483 --> 06:39.615
I don't think you understand

06:39.617 --> 06:41.484
The kind of pressure
i'm under now.

06:41.486 --> 06:43.653
The administration really cares
about v.A. Being the best,

06:43.655 --> 06:46.455
And so do the kids.

06:46.457 --> 06:48.624
What is your
long-term plan here?

06:48.626 --> 06:51.260
I mean, you can't go to
sectionals with just four kids.

06:51.262 --> 06:53.696
I just need more time.
And i'm not gonna get that

06:53.698 --> 06:56.032
If you crush all of their hopes
at this invitational.

06:56.034 --> 06:57.833
Please, mr. Shue.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.002
Look, this place
changed your life.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.672
You're reminded of that
every night that you go home

07:02.674 --> 07:04.807
To your wife
and your beautiful baby.

07:04.809 --> 07:07.009
Just... Consider paying it back

07:07.011 --> 07:08.844
For everything
it's done for you.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.719
(sighs)

07:25.129 --> 07:27.229
All right.

07:27.231 --> 07:28.531
Change of plan.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.132
Everyone gather round.

07:30.134 --> 07:32.134
We're gonna toss out
the numbers we've
been working on,

07:32.136 --> 07:33.569
And we're calling
an audible, okay?

07:33.571 --> 07:35.404
Brand-new songs.

07:35.406 --> 07:38.541
I will give them to you
in a half an hour.
What?

07:38.543 --> 07:40.042
That's insane.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.978
It's called thinking on
your feet, improvisation.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.547
It's gonna help us
work better as a team.

07:54.058 --> 07:56.125
(students scream, clamor)

08:00.098 --> 08:01.664
(girl screams)

08:16.714 --> 08:18.547
Good dragon.

08:18.549 --> 08:21.484
Your khaleesi loves you.

08:23.588 --> 08:24.920
Oh, hey, sue.
What's up?

08:24.922 --> 08:26.756
Sam, i have a question for you.

08:26.758 --> 08:29.625
How susceptible to
suggestion are you?

08:29.627 --> 08:31.727
Uh... I-i don't know.
What do you think?

08:31.729 --> 08:34.230
Well, i think you're
very susceptible to suggestion.

08:34.232 --> 08:35.431
Oh, my god,
i think you're right.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.565
Are you familiar with the film

08:36.567 --> 08:38.100
<i>The manchurian candidate?</i>

08:38.102 --> 08:40.436
I don't know.
Do you think i am?
Never mind.

08:43.641 --> 08:45.808
You're getting

08:45.810 --> 08:47.643
Very sleepy.

08:47.645 --> 08:48.944
Oh, my god, i'm so tired.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.613
When i snap my fingers,

08:50.615 --> 08:53.082
You'll be totally hypnotized.

08:53.084 --> 08:55.451
Oh, my god,
i'm totally hypnotized.

08:55.453 --> 08:57.820
I'm going to say
a series of words.

08:57.822 --> 08:59.321
Piano.

08:59.323 --> 09:01.957
Flat-bed truck.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.592
Let's do a song.

09:03.594 --> 09:04.927
Whoa.
When next

09:04.929 --> 09:06.228
You hear these words,

09:06.230 --> 09:08.330
You will be overwhelmed
with love

09:08.332 --> 09:09.999
For one rachel berry.

09:10.001 --> 09:11.967
Oh, my god, she's so hot.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.770
You will kiss her,
and the instant you do,

09:14.772 --> 09:18.808
You will wake up
and will not remember anything.

09:19.577 --> 09:21.744
Oh, hey, sue. What's up?

09:21.746 --> 09:23.879
(quietly):
Outstanding.

09:27.585 --> 09:30.119
(sighs, mumbles)

09:30.121 --> 09:33.823
(babbling)

09:33.825 --> 09:35.758
Okay, so, let's go
through the rules.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.259
We decided there's no judges,

09:37.261 --> 09:39.195
So this is really
about bragging rights.

09:39.197 --> 09:42.131
But still, my guys are taking
this very, very seriously,

09:42.133 --> 09:44.466
So i just want to make sure
that the order is

09:44.468 --> 09:46.702
Picked fairly-- and by fairly, i
mean that we're gonna go second.

09:46.704 --> 09:48.537
Um, by the way,
how is

09:48.539 --> 09:50.172
The filling up
of your roster going?

09:50.174 --> 09:51.974
Is that
going okay?
It's an invitational.

09:51.976 --> 09:54.610
We don't have to follow the
strict "show choir" rules.

09:54.612 --> 09:57.613
Has it occurred to either of you
that this could be

09:57.615 --> 09:58.814
A really awful idea

09:58.816 --> 10:00.649
For your team?
We just want to give them

10:00.651 --> 10:02.651
A sense of what to expect
at sectionals, and...

10:02.653 --> 10:04.320
You know, we were
also just hoping that

10:04.322 --> 10:06.722
Maybe you and mr. Schuester
would take it easy on us.

10:06.724 --> 10:07.690
Oh, no way.
No, no, no.

10:07.692 --> 10:08.791
Absolutely not.

10:08.793 --> 10:10.359
No one's going easy
on anybody.

10:10.361 --> 10:12.461
Nope. The warblers
are being rebuilt,

10:12.463 --> 10:14.129
Just like the new directions!

10:14.131 --> 10:15.564
I'm sorry, but my allegiance
is with them,

10:15.566 --> 10:17.800
(phone buzzing)
and if that at all seems scary

10:17.802 --> 10:20.336
To you guys, then you should
probably drop out. Oh, my god!

10:20.338 --> 10:22.771
It's dave. There's an intruder
in our apartment.

10:23.808 --> 10:25.341
Intruder?

10:25.343 --> 10:28.377
Dave, what is going on?
Karofsky:
In there!

10:28.379 --> 10:30.479
In the bedroom!
I thought i was gonna die!

10:30.481 --> 10:33.349
Blaine: What?
No! Don't go in there!
You're gonna get killed!

10:33.351 --> 10:35.251
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

10:35.253 --> 10:36.719
Is that a real, live bear cub?

10:36.721 --> 10:38.654
Blaine:
Uh, why is there a bear in here?

10:38.656 --> 10:39.989
Karofsky:
Why is there a bear in here?!

10:39.991 --> 10:41.657
I think i have
a pretty good idea.

10:43.761 --> 10:45.027
You know, you just...
You can't get

10:45.029 --> 10:46.695
Real italian food
like this in new york.

10:46.697 --> 10:48.564
Mm-mm.

10:48.566 --> 10:50.366
Mm, i'm actually having trouble,
like, adjusting

10:50.368 --> 10:52.434
To the lima pace--
i'm used to new york.

10:52.436 --> 10:53.903
Everything's
so fast-paced there.

10:53.905 --> 10:57.840
And i was thinking, the problem
with... Moving back home

10:57.842 --> 11:00.542
Is that, you know, you...
You fall back into old habits.

11:00.544 --> 11:02.711
Mm-hmm.
It's up to us now
to keep from going stale.

11:02.713 --> 11:06.615
I mean, what do you do
with your free time?
Mm... Besides cry?

11:06.617 --> 11:08.417
(voice breaks):
She's so talented.

11:08.419 --> 11:10.619
<i>I watch patti lupone's</i>
youngarts masterclass.

11:10.621 --> 11:12.621
Up. Make it harder.
(sobbing)

11:12.623 --> 11:15.491
Why? What do you do?
I blow glass.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.931
Wait, what, really?

11:21.933 --> 11:24.733
My point is,
we need to become proactive

11:24.735 --> 11:26.435
About what
our outside interests are.

11:26.437 --> 11:28.771
Yeah.
I mean, what is something
you always wanted to do?

11:28.773 --> 11:31.040
I don't know. I mean,
i've always wanted to learn

11:31.042 --> 11:32.374
How to play the piano.

11:33.711 --> 11:36.011
(distorted, echoing):
That's mine, too.

11:38.382 --> 11:39.448
Uh, let's do it.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.649
I mean, i'll get blaine
to teach us.

11:40.651 --> 11:42.251
He owes me for all the times
i shaved his back

11:42.253 --> 11:43.285
In new york.
We'll do it together.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.887
And we can keep
on each other's case

11:44.889 --> 11:46.622
To practice all the time--
it'll be great.

11:46.624 --> 11:49.191
Okay. Thanks, sam.

11:50.328 --> 11:52.628
You know...
I know that this

11:52.630 --> 11:55.097
Isn't a date or
anything, but...

11:55.099 --> 11:58.767
I just realized i haven't
spent time with a guy alone
in a long time, and...

11:58.769 --> 12:01.670
It feels good to do it with
someone i feel so safe with.

12:01.672 --> 12:04.807
Yeah. I, uh, i haven't been out
with anybody since, um...

12:04.809 --> 12:06.008
Mercedes and i broke up.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.876
Even though this isn't a date.

12:17.521 --> 12:19.521
Wait, wait, i'm very confused.
I had it on good authority

12:19.523 --> 12:21.323
That dave karofsky
was attracted to bears.

12:21.325 --> 12:25.327
Except in this case, a "bear"
refers to a burly, gay<i> man,</i>

12:25.329 --> 12:27.329
Not an actual bear.

12:27.331 --> 12:30.532
That would be really dangerous
and completely insane.

12:30.534 --> 12:33.135
Well, my tenure at this school
has expanded my horizons

12:33.137 --> 12:35.337
On what is or isn't
considered insane.

12:35.339 --> 12:36.772
Will schuester
once submerged

12:36.774 --> 12:39.508
A lucite platform
into the mckinley swimming pool

12:39.510 --> 12:41.710
So he could literally
walk on water

12:41.712 --> 12:43.345
To propose to his girlfriend.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.813
Now, that's pretty insane.

12:44.815 --> 12:46.648
This just has to stop.

12:46.650 --> 12:48.717
I don't want
to get back together

12:48.719 --> 12:50.719
With blaine.
I've moved on.

12:50.721 --> 12:52.788
I met someone online--
his name is walter.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.523
Oh, porcelain,
oh, no, no, no, no.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.225
You will not
come out of this alive.

12:56.227 --> 12:57.826
This person is
obviously a cannibal.

12:57.828 --> 12:59.328
I mean, look at you.

12:59.330 --> 13:01.830
You are exceptionally
well marbled.

13:01.832 --> 13:04.400
If i were on a deserted island
with everybody i knew,

13:04.402 --> 13:06.402
I would absolutely
eat you first.

13:06.404 --> 13:07.836
It doesn't even have
to be a deserted island.

13:07.838 --> 13:10.706
There could be any number
of casual dining establishments,

13:10.708 --> 13:13.409
And i would still opt
to eat<i> you--</i>

13:13.411 --> 13:17.713
A mouthwatering, delicious,
corn-fed porcelain rump roast.

13:17.715 --> 13:19.314
Okay, i'm leaving.

13:19.316 --> 13:21.650
You just have to stop, okay?
I'm serious.

13:21.652 --> 13:24.353
But what about your fabulous,
over-the-top gay wedding?!

13:24.355 --> 13:26.822
I already told becky she
could be the celebrant!

13:26.824 --> 13:29.825
When else am i ever gonna get
to provincetown?!

13:29.827 --> 13:32.895
(playing beethoven's
symphony no. 5)

13:37.201 --> 13:39.034
(music ends)

13:39.036 --> 13:41.537
Wow, that's
intimidating.
Blaine, thank you so much

13:41.539 --> 13:44.006
For taking time out
of your extremely busy
schedule to teach us.

13:44.008 --> 13:46.675
Yeah, you know, we
were gonna ask brad
the piano player

13:46.677 --> 13:49.311
But then i found
this scrapbook that he
keeps of women's feet.

13:56.220 --> 13:57.920
Okay. Anyway, um,

13:57.922 --> 13:59.922
Have a seat--
but don't just sit
any which way,

13:59.924 --> 14:01.890
Make sure you sit up
straight. Don't slouch.
Oh.

14:01.892 --> 14:04.293
Elbows always 90 degrees
away from the piano.

14:04.295 --> 14:06.095
Just so you know,
i'm not really a beginner.

14:06.097 --> 14:08.297
My dads put me in lessons
when i was four years old,

14:08.299 --> 14:09.765
And i just got bored,
so i quit.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.400
Huh. That's so unlike you.

14:11.402 --> 14:13.035
Um, i've made
this cute little chart

14:13.037 --> 14:14.903
Above the keys
to help you guys out.
Okay, good.

14:14.905 --> 14:16.538
So go ahead
and find middle c for me.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.207
Got it.
Excellent.

14:18.209 --> 14:21.376
Um, so i want you to think
of middle c, also known as c4,

14:21.378 --> 14:23.645
As kind of a quaint little town
between bass clef land

14:23.647 --> 14:25.647
And treble clef land.
So, it's kind of easy.

14:25.649 --> 14:28.383
No, no, no, i'm sorry. Wait.
Can you just, like, slow down?

14:28.385 --> 14:30.486
(mechanical whirring,
alarm horn blaring)

14:30.488 --> 14:31.987
God, what time is it?

14:31.989 --> 14:34.156
Whew, i fell asleep
hours ago

14:34.158 --> 14:37.659
When you were yammering on
about good posture and...

14:37.661 --> 14:39.561
A quaint little town.

14:39.563 --> 14:40.929
Um, what are you
doing up there?

14:40.931 --> 14:42.631
I'm just loosening
some bolts.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.433
You have no business
being in here.

14:44.435 --> 14:47.102
Funny, that's<i> exactly</i>
what i was gonna say to you.

14:47.104 --> 14:50.005
I thought i was rid of you
two years ago.

14:50.007 --> 14:53.809
Then you came limping
back to lima

14:53.811 --> 14:55.911
With your suitcase
full of glitter and tears.

14:55.913 --> 14:59.081
All right, i think we should
probably reschedule this.
No.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.750
That is an excellent idea.
Wouldn't you say so, sam?

15:04.488 --> 15:07.322
Awesome idea.
Later, buddy.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.525
Uh...
Go. Get out of here.
Go on.

15:10.828 --> 15:12.294
(groans)

15:12.296 --> 15:12.995
(snaps fingers)

15:12.997 --> 15:15.130
Hey, rachel, uh, wait up.

15:15.132 --> 15:19.201
Coach, you are one bad-ass,

15:19.203 --> 15:21.003
Crazy super bitch.

15:21.005 --> 15:22.671
Oh, becky, if
you just said

15:22.673 --> 15:25.374
I am one bad-ass,
crazy super bitch,

15:25.376 --> 15:27.876
You are correct.

15:27.878 --> 15:31.446
¶ i hate the world today ¶

15:31.448 --> 15:35.984
¶ you're so good to me,
i know, but i can't change ¶

15:35.986 --> 15:39.021
¶ tried to tell you,

15:39.023 --> 15:43.325
¶ like maybe
i'm an angel underneath ¶

15:43.327 --> 15:46.395
¶ innocent and sweet ¶

15:46.397 --> 15:49.531
¶ yesterday i cried ¶

15:49.533 --> 15:51.066
(students screaming)
¶ you must have been relieved ¶

15:51.068 --> 15:52.701
¶ to see the softer side ¶

15:52.703 --> 15:53.835
Boy: Aah!

15:53.837 --> 15:55.470
¶ i can understand ¶

15:55.472 --> 15:56.638
Boy 2: Unh!

15:56.640 --> 15:58.840
¶ how you'd be so confused ¶

15:58.842 --> 16:00.909
¶ i don't envy you ¶

16:00.911 --> 16:03.712
¶ i'm a little bit
of everything ¶

16:03.714 --> 16:05.514
¶ all rolled into one ¶

16:05.516 --> 16:07.683

¶ i'm a child, i'm a mother ¶

16:21.732 --> 16:23.732
¶ any other way ¶

16:25.536 --> 16:28.604
(instrumental interlude)

16:34.912 --> 16:36.678
¶ just when you think ¶

16:36.680 --> 16:39.615
(students screaming)

¶ the season's

17:21.058 --> 17:23.158
¶ ooh. ¶

17:23.160 --> 17:26.395
(song ends)

17:26.397 --> 17:28.964
(indistinct chatter nearby)

17:28.966 --> 17:30.732
(bell rings)

17:30.734 --> 17:32.768
Gosh, this place brings back
so many memories.

17:32.770 --> 17:35.504
I haven't been here
in a million years.
Tell me about it.

17:35.506 --> 17:38.240
When i look back at who i was
in high school, it's, like,

17:38.242 --> 17:40.842
I don't even recognize
that dude at all.

17:40.844 --> 17:42.611
That's why i admire you so much.

17:42.613 --> 17:45.614
You have been through a lot
to get to where you are today.

17:45.616 --> 17:46.815
Man:
Dave?

17:46.817 --> 17:47.983
I thought it was you!

17:47.985 --> 17:49.418
You look great.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.619
Have you been working out?

17:50.621 --> 17:52.287
Oh, uh, yeah, but...

17:52.289 --> 17:53.789
Nelson, this is my boyfriend,

17:53.791 --> 17:55.791
Blaine.
Hi.
Hey, nice to meet you.

17:55.793 --> 17:56.858
Nice to meet you.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.260
Yeah, i'm just here
with my boyfriend, stuart.

17:58.262 --> 17:58.927
Ah.

17:58.929 --> 18:01.496
Dave, is that you?

18:01.498 --> 18:03.098
Wait, you guys know
each other?

18:03.100 --> 18:04.299
Yeah!

18:04.301 --> 18:05.667
We went out a few times.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.470
Wait, is that dave karofsky?

18:08.472 --> 18:09.671
It's patrick.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.672
(overlapping chatter)

18:10.674 --> 18:12.674
Dave, dave, it's me, patrick.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.676
What the hell is going on?
Um...

18:14.678 --> 18:16.345
Well, good evening, gentlemen.

18:16.347 --> 18:19.848
David, i took the liberty
of asking every man you've dated

18:19.850 --> 18:22.684
To join you for dinner tonight
with blaine,

18:22.686 --> 18:23.819
But that's not all.

18:23.821 --> 18:25.487
I brought you both something.

18:25.489 --> 18:26.688
Oh, what do you have there?

18:26.690 --> 18:30.359
Well, it is your online
genealogy profile.

18:30.361 --> 18:31.727
I submitted

18:31.729 --> 18:34.129
Dna samples from
your hair follicles

18:34.131 --> 18:37.332
That i stole from the lint trap
in your washing machine,

18:37.334 --> 18:39.968
And i think you're going to be
very surprised with the results.

18:39.970 --> 18:44.139
It turns out you share
a great-great-grandfather,

18:44.141 --> 18:45.807
One thomas anderson,

18:45.809 --> 18:47.976
Watchmaker from philadelphia.

18:47.978 --> 18:50.879
Which means the two of you
are third cousins.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.147
You can't be serious.

18:52.149 --> 18:53.548
Dna doesn't lie.

18:53.550 --> 18:54.850
Well, have a
wonderful evening.

18:54.852 --> 18:56.485
Just remember,
you're about to have sex

18:56.487 --> 18:57.652
With a family member.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.759
(quiet, wry laugh)

19:03.761 --> 19:05.827
(playing clashing notes)

19:12.770 --> 19:14.569
I hate the piano.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.004
Blaine is throwing
too much at me.

19:16.006 --> 19:18.240
I-i feel like an idiot,
and then sue swoops in...

19:18.242 --> 19:19.775
Well, you know,
this stuff doesn't

19:19.777 --> 19:20.942
Just come easy
to everyone, okay?

19:20.944 --> 19:22.844
It's about practice.

19:22.846 --> 19:24.012
You do it enough times,
and it becomes second nature.

19:24.014 --> 19:25.580
Think about lizard tails

19:25.582 --> 19:27.082
That move around
even after they're cut off.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.383
What?

19:28.385 --> 19:30.252
Okay, no, forget that.

19:30.254 --> 19:33.288
My point is that an instrument
needs to be, like,

19:33.290 --> 19:35.791
An extension from your body,
like a muscle or a limb.

19:35.793 --> 19:37.526
Sam, you're really sweet,

19:37.528 --> 19:39.361
But i don't want
to do this anymore.

19:39.363 --> 19:40.796
I'm sorry.
Okay, now, sit down

19:40.798 --> 19:43.064
And close your eyes.

19:43.066 --> 19:44.966
Just do it.

19:44.968 --> 19:47.068
(sighing):
Okay.

19:47.070 --> 19:49.771
Now, look, you don't
need your eyes, okay?

19:49.773 --> 19:52.507
Stevie wonder, ray charles,
all the greats were blind.

19:53.877 --> 19:55.143
Okay?

19:55.145 --> 19:57.479
Now, just rely on your feel.

20:00.984 --> 20:02.951
G, give me a g, give me a g.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.720
Give me an a.

20:05.722 --> 20:07.823
Give me a c.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.257
Minor diminished.

20:09.259 --> 20:10.592
(chuckles)
okay.

20:10.594 --> 20:12.294
Now, give me an a minor.

20:13.797 --> 20:14.896
Hey, that tickles!

20:14.898 --> 20:16.431
Oh, i'm sorry,
but you totally have it,

20:16.433 --> 20:17.799
Way more than you even realize.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.970
Thanks, sam.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.105
You're pretty amazing.

20:24.107 --> 20:27.042
(chuckles)

20:29.279 --> 20:30.745
Man (over p.A.):
Don't forget to wear
your school colors tomorrow.

20:30.747 --> 20:32.447
Go, carmel!

20:32.449 --> 20:35.584
Well, just tell your husband
what i tell mine.

20:35.586 --> 20:37.686
"that's what you get
for marrying a blonde."

20:37.688 --> 20:38.920
(laughs)

20:40.591 --> 20:41.857
The principal will see you now.

20:41.859 --> 20:45.093
Aren't you a little smart aleck?

20:47.865 --> 20:51.166
Principal gunderson, thank you
so much for meeting with me.

20:54.304 --> 20:56.204
Is there a problem?

20:56.206 --> 20:57.973
Principal figgins?

20:57.975 --> 21:02.677
No, i am
abigail figgins gunderson.

21:02.679 --> 21:03.945
Principal figgins
is my brother.

21:03.947 --> 21:05.547
Principal and i
are one year apart

21:05.549 --> 21:07.349
And we both chose
careers in...

21:07.351 --> 21:08.717
(inhales deeply)

21:08.719 --> 21:10.385
...High school administration.

21:10.387 --> 21:13.355
Wait... Figgins' first name
is "principal"?

21:13.357 --> 21:14.723
Of course.

21:14.725 --> 21:16.358
He is first born.

21:17.394 --> 21:19.861
Bizarro figgins.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.297
I understand
you have an issue

21:22.299 --> 21:25.133
Concerning carmel high's
study skills teacher

21:25.135 --> 21:26.968
And glee club director,
will schuester.

21:26.970 --> 21:29.437
That is correct.

21:30.574 --> 21:33.675
As you can see...

21:33.677 --> 21:36.845
I have drone footage
in which will schuester

21:36.847 --> 21:38.847
Pledges his loyalty
to the new directions!

21:38.849 --> 21:42.684
And announces his intentions
to sabotage vocal adrenaline.

21:42.686 --> 21:44.920
You have a traitor
in your midst.

21:44.922 --> 21:46.388
(tablet device blips off)

21:46.390 --> 21:50.859
This news shocks me
to my very core.

21:50.861 --> 21:53.929
I think you better sit down
and have a very frank talk

21:53.931 --> 21:55.530
With one will schuester.

21:55.532 --> 21:58.934
You need to determine where
his true loyalties lie.

22:05.876 --> 22:06.875
I've got it!

22:06.877 --> 22:08.577
Well,<i> we've</i> got it.

22:08.579 --> 22:10.946
<i>We've</i> got the first two
songs for invitationals.

22:10.948 --> 22:14.282
Uh... Don't we need
more people

22:14.284 --> 22:16.017
Just to participate
in invitationals?

22:16.019 --> 22:19.454
No, you don't need
a full glee club
for invitationals.

22:19.456 --> 22:21.556
It's a trial run
for future competitions.

22:21.558 --> 22:22.958
No judges or prizes.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.026
(whispering):
More stage time for us.

22:25.028 --> 22:27.395
Both (whispering):
Twinning.

22:27.397 --> 22:31.199
And this is where my new piano
skills will help us out.

22:31.201 --> 22:34.269
(playing a random melody)

22:41.044 --> 22:44.946
Th-there is no winner
or loser at invitationals,

22:44.948 --> 22:46.781
But just like
a debutante ball

22:46.783 --> 22:48.483
Or a quinceañera,
it is your chance

22:48.485 --> 22:50.785
To introduce yourself
to the show choir world.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.954
We're gonna be up against some
of the greatest show choirs

22:52.956 --> 22:54.823
In ohio-- in america--

22:54.825 --> 22:56.391
And the warblers
and vocal adrenaline

22:56.393 --> 22:59.060
Have a very strong history,
so this is our chance

22:59.062 --> 23:00.562
To show them what
they're up against.

23:00.564 --> 23:02.464
(sighs)

23:02.466 --> 23:04.566
(quietly):
So, we're screwed.

23:04.568 --> 23:06.668
We're screwed.

23:07.904 --> 23:09.738
Sue, how dare you
do this to me!

23:09.740 --> 23:11.239
Now my job is on the line!

23:11.241 --> 23:13.508
You know, i thought
we were friends!

23:13.510 --> 23:15.076
So did i, william,
until you made a mockery

23:15.078 --> 23:16.311
Of my friendly overtures,

23:16.313 --> 23:17.946
By making me
clean up after you

23:17.948 --> 23:19.514
Like a common house slave.

23:19.516 --> 23:20.849
What are you talking about?

23:20.851 --> 23:22.851
Oh, you know exactly
what i'm talking about.

23:22.853 --> 23:24.486
Your complete lack
of table manners

23:24.488 --> 23:26.254
Was the last straw.

23:26.256 --> 23:29.858
It was a disposable plastic fork
that broke the camel's back

23:29.860 --> 23:32.961
And now i feel it is my duty
to stop holding back

23:32.963 --> 23:35.296
And get real honest with you,
will schuester.

23:35.298 --> 23:37.832
Fine. Bring it on.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.535
You remember that christmas
when you foolishly

23:40.537 --> 23:41.836
Let me into your apartment,
for some reason?

23:41.838 --> 23:42.971
Yeah...

23:42.973 --> 23:44.506
Well, the primary ingredient

23:44.508 --> 23:46.307
Of that fruitcake
that i watched you enjoy

23:46.309 --> 23:47.942
Was actually
three years of plaque

23:47.944 --> 23:50.512
That brad the piano player
had scraped off his teeth

23:50.514 --> 23:51.980
And collected into
a small jar.

23:51.982 --> 23:54.149
And you never should have
let me use your bathroom

23:54.151 --> 23:56.051
Because the minoxidil
that you've been

23:56.053 --> 23:58.687
Rubbing into your scalp twice
daily for the last three years

23:58.689 --> 24:00.722
Is actually just my pee.

24:00.724 --> 24:02.957
Wha...?

24:02.959 --> 24:05.894
Why would i stoop
to such puerile acts?

24:05.896 --> 24:08.730
Because i hate you,
will schuester.

24:08.732 --> 24:09.998
And i will stop at nothing

24:10.000 --> 24:11.399
Until i see you homeless
in the streets,

24:11.401 --> 24:12.967
Drinking gutter runoff,

24:12.969 --> 24:14.669
And allowing passersby
to perform lewd acts

24:14.671 --> 24:16.337
On your butt-chin, for money.

24:16.339 --> 24:18.673
You are a fatuous,
dim-witted,

24:18.675 --> 24:20.175
Borderline pederast,

24:20.177 --> 24:22.877
Who tears up faster than
a gay jihadi in a sandstorm.

24:22.879 --> 24:26.347
You have befouled
the profession of teaching

24:26.349 --> 24:28.550
By accepting not only one

24:28.552 --> 24:30.351
But two
teacher of the year awards

24:30.353 --> 24:32.420
Despite not speaking a word
of the foreign language

24:32.422 --> 24:33.855
You purport to teach.

24:33.857 --> 24:37.759
Like the storied predators
of yesteryear, will,

24:37.761 --> 24:40.762
You pick only the most
vulnerable students to favor

24:40.764 --> 24:42.197
While actively
neglecting the others.

24:42.199 --> 24:44.432
Like that gross kid
with the dreadlocks,

24:44.434 --> 24:46.034
Or that poor irish
idiot rory.

24:46.036 --> 24:48.703
Or the black dancer,
whose name none of us remember

24:48.705 --> 24:51.039
Because you rode his back
to a win at sectionals,

24:51.041 --> 24:52.774
And then promptly ignored him

24:52.776 --> 24:53.842
Into oblivion.

24:53.844 --> 24:56.044
You positively
worship a student

24:56.046 --> 24:58.413
If they can so much
as carry a tune,

24:58.415 --> 25:00.115
And yet you don't know
a single name

25:00.117 --> 25:03.351
Of the only true musical
geniuses in that choir room--

25:03.353 --> 25:04.786
The band!--

25:04.788 --> 25:06.888
Who have demonstrated,
time and again,

25:06.890 --> 25:08.857
That they can,
at the drop of a hat,

25:08.859 --> 25:11.025
Play literally any song
you can name,

25:11.027 --> 25:15.497
And still, you treat them like
so much nameless human garbage.

25:16.633 --> 25:18.633
Your bizarre psycho-sexual

25:18.635 --> 25:20.635
Obsession with that glee club

25:20.637 --> 25:22.070
Was disturbing
from the first moment

25:22.072 --> 25:24.105
You stalked a nude student
in the showers.

25:24.107 --> 25:26.307
You know, i'm honestly
surprised you didn't re-enact

25:26.309 --> 25:27.642
What was clearly
the formative event

25:27.644 --> 25:29.244
Of your own teenage years,

25:29.246 --> 25:31.813
And sandusky the poor kid
right there and then.

25:31.815 --> 25:34.549
Oh, and i think those
absorbent sweater vests

25:34.551 --> 25:36.251
Actually hide the fact
that you lactate

25:36.253 --> 25:38.386
Every time you give one
of your excruciatingly

25:38.388 --> 25:40.088
Condescending pep talks.

25:40.090 --> 25:44.626
Your charms wore off a
<i>long</i> time ago, william...

25:44.628 --> 25:47.228
Somewhere around bieber week.

25:47.230 --> 25:49.664
So why don't you take
your washboard abs

25:49.666 --> 25:50.932
And your washboard forehead,

25:50.934 --> 25:53.434
Get the hell
out of my office.

25:53.436 --> 25:55.136
Oh, and take that
uncomfortable smirk

25:55.138 --> 25:57.972
And the nine-foot fart you
must be holding in, with you,

25:57.974 --> 26:00.108
And let 'er rip the
second you get home.

26:00.110 --> 26:01.776
'cause you know what?
If you're lucky,

26:01.778 --> 26:03.611
That sphincter
just might toot out

26:03.613 --> 26:05.914
The first minute and a half
of "wheel in the sky,"

26:05.916 --> 26:08.950
Which is the only journey song
you haven't yet managed to ruin.

26:08.952 --> 26:11.953
You know what, sue?

26:11.955 --> 26:13.855
I happen to know that
you're not long for this school.

26:13.857 --> 26:15.423
What are you talking about?

26:15.425 --> 26:17.926
I heard a rumor that you are
making retirement plans.

26:17.928 --> 26:19.994
Damn it, becky.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.529
She tweeted it, didn't she?

26:21.531 --> 26:23.198
I'll tell you right now
that i'm going to do

26:23.200 --> 26:25.166
Everything in my power to
make sure that the glee club

26:25.168 --> 26:26.968
Is a permanent fixture
at this school,

26:26.970 --> 26:29.470
Long after you're gone.

26:29.472 --> 26:31.039
It's good talking to you, sue.

26:38.815 --> 26:39.948
Kurt:
I know you're overworked.

26:39.950 --> 26:41.149
I'm just saying
this auditorium

26:41.151 --> 26:42.851
Could use a little bit
more of your attention.

26:42.853 --> 26:44.853
I mean, there's gum
on half of these seats.

26:44.855 --> 26:47.822
Don't blame me,
blame the parents!

26:47.824 --> 26:50.124
They let johnny and susie
run wild,

26:50.126 --> 26:51.993
But johnny and susie can't read.

26:51.995 --> 26:53.228
It's an american tragedy!

26:53.230 --> 26:54.963
Blaine: Hi.
Sorry to interrupt.

26:54.965 --> 26:56.865
Um, i'm supposed to give
rachel and sam a piano lesson.

26:56.867 --> 26:57.899
I-i can't
find them anywhere.

26:57.901 --> 27:00.401
I spotted them in the courtyard

27:00.403 --> 27:03.738
Sharing a hot, soft pretzel
with honey mustard.

27:03.740 --> 27:05.406
I'm no psychic,
but i predict

27:05.408 --> 27:09.744
Another tempestuous, sexy,
glee club romance.

27:09.746 --> 27:11.646
Speaking of which,
i will leave you two

27:11.648 --> 27:13.414
Ex-lovebirds alone.

27:13.416 --> 27:15.850
Thank you very much.

27:15.852 --> 27:17.619
Thank you.

27:20.223 --> 27:22.090
Uh-oh.

27:22.092 --> 27:23.725
Something's wrong.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.426
Everything... Okay?

27:25.428 --> 27:26.661
Everything is wrong.

27:26.663 --> 27:27.929
Dave has dated, like,

27:27.931 --> 27:30.198
Every guy with facial hair

27:30.200 --> 27:31.266
In the greater midwest,

27:31.268 --> 27:32.400
And, evidently,

27:32.402 --> 27:33.835
We're related.

27:33.837 --> 27:35.203
Wait, what?
Yeah.

27:35.205 --> 27:37.405
Sue went on one of those
ancestry web sites,

27:37.407 --> 27:39.707
And she discovered that dave
and i are third cousins.

27:39.709 --> 27:41.943
Blaine, there-there
is no universe

27:41.945 --> 27:44.212
Where you and karofsky
are related.

27:44.214 --> 27:46.781
Sue is obviously just trying
to get you guys to break up

27:46.783 --> 27:48.016
So we get back together.

27:48.018 --> 27:50.118
Why can't she,
and everyone else,

27:50.120 --> 27:52.854
Just understand that, yes,
you were my first love...

27:52.856 --> 27:54.689
And you were mine.
...But i just think,

27:54.691 --> 27:56.124
Like you always say,

27:56.126 --> 27:59.260
We're probably better off as...
Great friends, you know?

28:00.730 --> 28:02.897
Well, i'm glad that we could
be adult about this.

28:02.899 --> 28:03.965
Yeah.

28:03.967 --> 28:05.633
And, full disclosure,

28:05.635 --> 28:08.303
I've actually met
a really nice guy on line

28:08.305 --> 28:10.471
And, uh, we have
our first date tonight.

28:11.942 --> 28:13.574
Oh!

28:13.576 --> 28:15.810
Well, that's... Awesome.

28:17.147 --> 28:20.315
That's, um... I hope
that goes really well.

28:20.317 --> 28:22.417
(quietly): Yeah.
Yeah, uh...

28:22.419 --> 28:24.786
Well, you know, he damn well
better know that

28:24.788 --> 28:28.990
He is on a date with america's
most eligible bachelor.

28:28.992 --> 28:29.924
(wry chuckle)

28:29.926 --> 28:31.826
Um... I-i gotta go.

28:31.828 --> 28:32.794
Um...

28:32.796 --> 28:34.495
I-i really gotta
get going.

28:34.497 --> 28:35.797
I gotta find those guys.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.999
Um... It was good to...
Good to see you.

28:38.001 --> 28:38.933
Oh, yeah, you, too.

28:38.935 --> 28:40.902
Oh. Hello.
(laughs)

28:40.904 --> 28:42.236
Yeah, the, um...

28:42.238 --> 28:43.237
You, too.
You, too.

28:43.239 --> 28:44.806
Yeah.
Okay.

28:47.978 --> 28:49.844
(sighs deeply)

28:49.846 --> 28:52.747
(playing light melody)

28:52.749 --> 28:54.148
¶ girl, you sound
so good. ¶

28:54.150 --> 28:55.316
(laughs)

28:55.318 --> 28:56.818
John mayer.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.919
Uh, no, seriously,
though, you're...

28:57.921 --> 28:59.253
You're sounding amazing.

28:59.255 --> 29:00.621
I mean, you're getting
really good.

29:00.623 --> 29:02.690
I think i'm really
getting the hang of it.

29:02.692 --> 29:04.258
I gotta be honest--
i think these piano lessons

29:04.260 --> 29:05.860
Were a really good idea.

29:05.862 --> 29:07.762
And thank you so much
for being so patient with me

29:07.764 --> 29:09.330
And just...
Helping me to stay calm.

29:09.332 --> 29:10.865
Well, i mean,
it wasn't hard, i mean...

29:10.867 --> 29:12.166
There's nothing you can't do.

29:13.870 --> 29:15.837
(sam plays intro to vanessa
carlton's "a thousand miles")

29:15.839 --> 29:18.506
(rachel continues the intro)

29:18.508 --> 29:20.041
I love this song.

29:28.852 --> 29:32.220
¶ making my way downtown,
walking fast ¶

29:32.222 --> 29:34.288
¶ faces passing,

29:38.995 --> 29:40.995
¶ staring blankly ahead ¶

31:00.043 --> 31:04.278
¶ 'cause you know

31:04.280 --> 31:08.416

31:20.096 --> 31:24.899

¶ if i could just see you ¶

31:31.141 --> 31:34.976
¶ hold you ¶

¶ tonight. ¶

31:46.789 --> 31:48.856
(song ends)

32:01.638 --> 32:03.838
And then the hooker says,
"no, that's not a cheese taco,

32:03.840 --> 32:05.973
Jonah hill."

32:05.975 --> 32:07.608
(laughter)
he was kissing a hooker.

32:07.610 --> 32:08.976
Hey, guys.

32:08.978 --> 32:11.812
Can i just talk to your
coach for a second?

32:11.814 --> 32:13.714
Okay, so i'm just
gonna say this,

32:13.716 --> 32:15.383
Because i haven't been able
to think about anything else,

32:15.385 --> 32:17.385
And i got, like,
zero sleep last night, but...

32:17.387 --> 32:18.619
Our kiss?

32:18.621 --> 32:20.221
What kiss?

32:20.223 --> 32:21.722
"what kiss?"

32:21.724 --> 32:22.957
Exactly, right,
we're both creative people,

32:22.959 --> 32:24.192
And sometimes creative people

32:24.194 --> 32:25.826
Create bonds
with their fellow actors,

32:25.828 --> 32:27.862
And sometimes those bonds
create gestures that don't

32:27.864 --> 32:29.030
Necessarily mean the same thing
in the real world

32:29.032 --> 32:30.064
As they would in show business.

32:30.066 --> 32:31.499
Anyways, um, i just...

32:31.501 --> 32:34.302
I've really liked hanging out
with you, sam,

32:34.304 --> 32:36.070
And i-i wanted to ask you
this yesterday,

32:36.072 --> 32:37.972
But you sort of left,
like, really fast,

32:37.974 --> 32:40.741
But, um, do you want to get
a coffee with me sometime?

32:40.743 --> 32:42.243
Oh, are you,

32:42.245 --> 32:43.978
Are you asking me,
like, out on a date?

32:45.982 --> 32:47.582
Yeah.

32:47.584 --> 32:49.383
Rachel, uh,

32:49.385 --> 32:51.819
That's super sweet,
but i-i can't.

32:51.821 --> 32:54.188
And it's not because
of your teeny-tiny booty.

32:54.190 --> 32:56.023
I actually like
teeny-tiny booties.

32:56.025 --> 32:58.192
It's... I'm kind of still
in love with mercedes.

32:58.194 --> 32:59.727
Oh.
Sorry.

32:59.729 --> 33:00.995
Yeah.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.209
Oh, hey, sue. What's up?

33:15.211 --> 33:16.277
Uh, what-what are you doing?

33:16.279 --> 33:18.012
And...

33:18.014 --> 33:20.414
(distorted):
You're hypnotized again.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.549
Oh, my god, i'm hypnotized.

33:21.551 --> 33:23.050
That was so fast.

33:23.052 --> 33:25.186
You've done well,
my dark apprentice.

33:25.188 --> 33:26.854
Phase two

33:26.856 --> 33:29.423
Of my sinister plan
will now commence.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.292
Triskaidekaphobia.

33:31.294 --> 33:33.294
Ambrosia salad.

33:33.296 --> 33:34.962
Goodluck jonathan.

33:34.964 --> 33:36.697
Wait, i'm confused.

33:36.699 --> 33:38.599
Do those words hypnotize me
or dehypnotize me?

33:38.601 --> 33:40.534
Neither, they're just words
i like.

33:40.536 --> 33:42.136
Okay.
As you continue

33:42.138 --> 33:44.939
To gaslight rachel berry,

33:44.941 --> 33:48.776
Phase two will incorporate the
tormenting of will schuester.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.778
You will start by stealing

33:50.780 --> 33:51.946
His utility bills

33:51.948 --> 33:54.215
From the mailbox
in front of his condo.

33:54.217 --> 33:56.784
Awesome.

33:58.488 --> 34:00.321
(sniffs)

34:01.224 --> 34:02.957
Hi, i-i'm still waiting
for someone,

34:02.959 --> 34:04.592
But in the meantime,

34:04.594 --> 34:06.227
I would love a bottle
of sparkling water.

34:06.229 --> 34:07.995
Kurt?

34:07.997 --> 34:10.665
I'm walter.
It's good to finally meet you.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.733
Oh, hi!

34:12.735 --> 34:13.901
I'd know you anywhere.

34:13.903 --> 34:15.069
You look just like your photo.

34:15.071 --> 34:17.605
Yeah, and your photo

34:17.607 --> 34:21.242
Definitely looks like you
a-a-a-at some point in time.

34:21.244 --> 34:23.077
This is fun.

34:23.079 --> 34:24.445
How old are you, exactly?

34:24.447 --> 34:25.913
(chuckles)

34:25.915 --> 34:28.115
Well, since you're asking,

34:28.117 --> 34:29.483
I'm...

34:29.485 --> 34:31.485
50... (muttering) years old.

34:32.288 --> 34:34.155
No, but true story.

34:34.157 --> 34:36.023
Last week, i bought a six-pack
of beer at the grocery store,

34:36.025 --> 34:37.491
And the clerk asked me
for my i.D.

34:37.493 --> 34:38.626
I don't know

34:38.628 --> 34:40.027
Is she thought i was underage

34:40.029 --> 34:41.862
Or an undocumented worker,
but the point is,

34:41.864 --> 34:43.364
I still feel like

34:43.366 --> 34:45.099
I'm 30,

34:45.101 --> 34:46.834
Which is why i still use
that photo in my profile.

34:46.836 --> 34:48.169
Yeah.

34:48.171 --> 34:49.870
Have to be honest,

34:49.872 --> 34:51.272
I-i, i just thought it was
an instagram filter.

34:51.274 --> 34:53.307
You're on instagram?
Me, too!

34:53.309 --> 34:54.475
Yeah.

34:54.477 --> 34:57.078
My handle is hotcupowalter.

34:58.181 --> 34:59.847
That's what my wife used
to call me.

35:01.150 --> 35:04.552
I was married for 33 years.

35:04.554 --> 35:07.355
I got a couple kids
who're... About your age.

35:07.357 --> 35:09.824
Ooh, no kidding, huh?

35:09.826 --> 35:11.525
Yeah.

35:11.527 --> 35:14.362
Yeah, i didn't come out
of the closet until last year.

35:14.364 --> 35:16.797
You know, i thought i never
was gonna come out.

35:16.799 --> 35:18.966
Look, w-walter,

35:18.968 --> 35:21.535
Y-you seem like a very nice man,

35:21.537 --> 35:22.737
But it's just that,

35:22.739 --> 35:24.472
Well, when talked on the phone,

35:24.474 --> 35:26.307
You never mentioned
that you were in your 50s,

35:26.309 --> 35:28.743
Or that-that you were married
with-with kids.

35:28.745 --> 35:31.045
But that's because we got
so busy chatting

35:31.047 --> 35:33.914
About how<i> golden girls</i>
is the greatest sitcom

35:33.916 --> 35:34.915
Of all time.

35:34.917 --> 35:36.817
Look, you're
absolutely right.

35:36.819 --> 35:39.754
I should've been more honest,
and i wasn't.

35:39.756 --> 35:41.322
But it's not because
i'm deluded

35:41.324 --> 35:43.391
Or some sort of a psycho,

35:43.393 --> 35:44.992
It's just that...

35:44.994 --> 35:47.194
I was really enjoying
getting to know you.

35:47.196 --> 35:50.364
I didn't want to say something
that would scare you off.

35:50.366 --> 35:52.733
Well...

35:52.735 --> 35:55.002
I can see that
this is not a good fit.

35:55.004 --> 35:57.371
So, i'm not gonna waste
any more of your time.

35:57.373 --> 35:59.039
I'm really sorry.

35:59.041 --> 36:00.241
Wait, no, i'm sorry.

36:00.243 --> 36:02.076
I-i don't mean to be rude.

36:02.078 --> 36:03.077
It's just that
this is just,

36:03.079 --> 36:04.678
You know, a lot to take in.

36:04.680 --> 36:08.048
Well, how about this?

36:08.050 --> 36:10.584
What if you and i just
started out as friends?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.253
No expectations whatsoever.

36:12.255 --> 36:14.889
We take it really slow,

36:14.891 --> 36:17.558
And if either one of us
gets uncomfortable,

36:17.560 --> 36:19.260
We call it a day.

36:19.262 --> 36:22.029
(sighs)

36:22.031 --> 36:23.631
I-i like the sound of that.

36:23.633 --> 36:25.132
(chuckles)

36:26.068 --> 36:28.035
¶ hey, well, so... ¶

36:31.073 --> 36:33.073
Yes.

36:33.075 --> 36:35.075
Sam, buddy, hey.

36:35.077 --> 36:35.910
What... (sighs)

36:35.912 --> 36:37.378
I-i think that's my mail.

36:37.380 --> 36:39.079
Oh, yeah, i know,
rachel asked me to steal it.

36:39.081 --> 36:40.481
The bills, mostly.

36:40.483 --> 36:42.817
She said that, you know,
if you stopped paying them,

36:42.819 --> 36:44.919
That maybe you would get
all distracted with,
like, collection agencies

36:44.921 --> 36:46.454
And stop focusing on work,

36:46.456 --> 36:48.055
Which would give her an
advantage on vocal adrenaline.

36:48.057 --> 36:49.490
Wait, seriously?
Oh, yeah.

36:49.492 --> 36:51.258
You know rachel,
she'll do anything to win.

36:51.260 --> 36:51.992
I-i can't believe
that she would do that.

36:51.994 --> 36:53.294
We're friends.

36:53.296 --> 36:54.929
She had no problem reminding
of that

36:54.931 --> 36:56.464
When she asked me
to throw the invitational.

36:56.466 --> 36:59.133
Between you and me,
rachel's kind of pissed at you.

36:59.135 --> 37:01.101
Yeah, she thinks that

37:01.103 --> 37:03.404
Your suspiciously
constant positivity

37:03.406 --> 37:04.772
And encouragement
is what clouded

37:04.774 --> 37:06.307
Her judgment to
do her tv show,

37:06.309 --> 37:07.908
And, um, she also blames you

37:07.910 --> 37:09.343
For that time
she broke her nose,

37:09.345 --> 37:10.945
"run joey run" and boko haram.

37:10.947 --> 37:12.313
Which i don't know
what the last one is.

37:12.315 --> 37:14.515
I am so naive.

37:14.517 --> 37:16.016
She's been playing me
this whole time.

37:16.018 --> 37:17.751
Well, hey, look,
if you run into her,

37:17.753 --> 37:19.587
Could you please just do me
a favor and tell her

37:19.589 --> 37:20.955
That i stole your bills,

37:20.957 --> 37:22.323
Because she asked me
to come at night,

37:22.325 --> 37:24.592
And then there's
this whole a.M./p.M. Thing...

37:24.594 --> 37:26.660
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

37:28.297 --> 37:30.364
(sighs)

37:37.273 --> 37:39.106
Male student (over p.A.):
Vocal adrenaline,
please report backstage.

37:39.108 --> 37:40.541
Two minutes to showtime.

37:40.543 --> 37:41.709
Will: All right, guys,
how we feeling?

37:41.711 --> 37:43.811
You all ready?
Yeah, i bet

37:43.813 --> 37:44.979
You're super stoked.

37:44.981 --> 37:46.547
I am stoked.

37:46.549 --> 37:48.048
I've never been more stoked
or more serious.

37:48.050 --> 37:50.017
You guys should be serious, too.

37:50.019 --> 37:51.385
Don't touch me.

37:51.387 --> 37:53.320
I want you to get fired up

37:53.322 --> 37:54.788
For what's coming, all right?

37:54.790 --> 37:57.558
Okay, yes, mckinley alumni

37:57.560 --> 38:00.461
Tried to tear at my loyalties,
and i almost let them.

38:00.463 --> 38:01.996
But i will never
let you down, okay?

38:01.998 --> 38:04.965
Vocal adrenaline has always been
the team to topple,

38:04.967 --> 38:06.367
And today is no different,
all right?

38:06.369 --> 38:10.204
So i want you to own
this stage and dominate.

38:10.206 --> 38:11.705
Are you bipolar?

38:12.642 --> 38:14.208
Okay, show circle.

38:17.547 --> 38:19.013
That means...

38:19.015 --> 38:20.014
Okay.

38:20.016 --> 38:21.482
Um...

38:21.484 --> 38:22.683
It's kind of my thing.

38:22.685 --> 38:24.418
We all just get in there
and just...

38:24.420 --> 38:26.654
Boy:
We don't like you.

38:26.656 --> 38:28.022
All right,

38:28.024 --> 38:29.390
Amazing!

38:29.392 --> 38:30.691
You guys will learn that later.

38:30.693 --> 38:32.026
Okay, have a good show.

38:32.028 --> 38:34.261
Just-just go out there and...

38:34.263 --> 38:36.330
And-and win.

38:41.070 --> 38:44.238
Please direct your blank stares
to the curtain behind me.

38:44.240 --> 38:48.576
Soon it will open and
there will be blood sport.

38:48.578 --> 38:50.277
Happy hunger games.

38:50.279 --> 38:53.447
May the odds be
ever in your favor.
