( slurring)
I'm up, I'm up. Whadda ya want?

01:00.460 --> 01:02.530
All I wanted to tell you about
was this new barbecue joint.

01:02.590 --> 01:04.360
Ooh, barbecue!

01:04.430 --> 01:07.730
It's called Greasy Joe's
Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.670
Ooh, I can still taste the sauce
between my fingers, and--

01:11.730 --> 01:13.160
are you ready for this?--

01:13.240 --> 01:14.570
It's all you can eat!

and five and six...

01:23.450 --> 01:24.750
Marge, honey

01:24.810 --> 01:27.440
I got five words
to say to you.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.360
Greasy Joe's
Bottomless Bar-B-Q Pit.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.060
Homer, remember you promised

01:33.120 --> 01:34.990
you'd try to limit pork
to six servings a week.

01:35.060 --> 01:38.200
Marge, I'm only human.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.500
Now look. Here's what
we're gonna do.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.800
We'll unload the kids
on Patty and Selma

01:41.860 --> 01:43.690
Saturday night,
and then we'll eat

01:43.770 --> 01:45.470
until they kick us
out of the place.

01:45.530 --> 01:46.690
Just like old times.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.170
Hmm. Saturday night?

01:48.240 --> 01:50.410
I'm not even sure my sisters
will be available.

01:50.470 --> 01:51.730
I'll take that bet.

This Saturday?

02:01.050 --> 02:03.790
We're going
to Stanley Peterson's wedding.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.850
The way he's going at her

02:05.920 --> 02:07.790
you'd think
they were already married.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.130
Hey, alley cats!

Save it for the honeymoon.

Well, if you have
other plans...

02:13.430 --> 02:14.470
D-ohh!

02:14.530 --> 02:16.330
It's no problem.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.340
We'll beat it
before they throw the bouquet.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.070
"F," "L..."

02:22.140 --> 02:23.740
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.640
That's a "C," isn't it?

02:25.710 --> 02:27.280
If that was an oncoming vehicle

02:27.340 --> 02:28.500
you'd be dead now.

Next!

02:46.460 --> 02:48.130
Martha, my dear

02:48.200 --> 02:51.340
I remember the first day
that I met you.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.170
Hello

02:54.240 --> 02:55.170
Selma.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.510
Hello, Stanley.

02:57.570 --> 02:58.970
Is this seat taken?

02:59.040 --> 03:00.310
Yes, it is.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.910
Hey, beat it!

03:05.410 --> 03:08.610
Had I not chosen the seat
that was next to you

Martha, my love

03:10.090 --> 03:13.190

I might have ended up with.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.490
Hmm.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.830
Selma:
♪ Brandy, you're a fine girl ♪

03:18.890 --> 03:22.190
♪ What a good wife
you would be ♪

03:22.260 --> 03:27.930
♪ But my life, my love
and my lady is the sea. ♪

03:28.000 --> 03:29.330
Poor Brandy.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.600
Aunt Selma, do you think
you'll ever get married?

03:32.670 --> 03:34.100
Oh, I don't know.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.150
Why? You know somebody?

03:36.210 --> 03:39.950
No, and since I'm sure that
you'd only resent the pity
of an eight year-old niece,

03:40.020 --> 03:41.520
I'll simply hope that you're

03:41.580 --> 03:44.050
one of the statistically
insignificant number

03:44.120 --> 03:48.360
of 40-year-old, single women
who ever find their fair prince.

Yeah.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.370
( <i>gasping with relief )</i>

04:04.440 --> 04:06.110
I'll tell you one thing.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.610
Greasy Joe is sorry
he ever saw the likes of me.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.620
Marge, I need
to speak with you alone.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.490
( <i>snoring )</i>

04:16.220 --> 04:18.220
Oh, and that sauce, Barney--

04:18.290 --> 04:21.730
I could have drunk a bowl of it
by itself.

04:21.790 --> 04:24.660
Oh, Barney,
that's just my sister-in-law.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.800
I'll get right to the point.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.300
I'm getting older,
fatter and uglier.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.230
Please, Marge,
help me find a man

04:32.300 --> 04:34.740
before it's too late.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.830
Well, I'll try.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.810
( <i>stomach gurgling )</i>

04:38.870 --> 04:41.800
Homer, do you remember
our last family vacation

04:41.880 --> 04:45.480
when you made us go
to the Bowlers Hall of Fame

04:45.550 --> 04:47.290
in St. Louis, Missouri

04:47.350 --> 04:48.890
so you could see
that car

04:48.950 --> 04:50.250
shaped like
a giant bowling pin?

04:50.320 --> 04:52.460
Remember?
Who could forget?

04:52.520 --> 04:53.730
Then you'll
also remember

04:53.790 --> 04:55.790
that you owe me a favor

04:55.860 --> 04:59.060
to be called up whenever
and for whatever reason

04:59.130 --> 05:00.570
I desire.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.670
But that was just
an idle promise.

05:02.730 --> 05:05.070
Not to me.
Ohhh...

05:05.130 --> 05:09.160
I want you to find a husband
for my sister, Selma.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.510
Find a husband?

05:10.570 --> 05:12.900
Wait. Which one's Selma again?

05:12.980 --> 05:15.550
She's the one who likes
Police Academy movies

05:15.610 --> 05:16.910
and Hummel figurines

05:16.980 --> 05:19.920
and walking through the park
on clear, autumn days.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.320
Oh, yeah.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.640
But I thought
she was the one

05:23.720 --> 05:25.720
that didn't like
to be, you know, touched.

05:25.790 --> 05:27.730
It's Patty who chose
the life of celibacy.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.590
Selma simply had celibacy
thrust upon her.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.760
But, Marge...

05:30.830 --> 05:34.370
Homer, you will find her a man!

05:34.430 --> 05:35.370
All right.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.130
And not just any man.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.100
Okay.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.100
He should be
honest and caring

05:40.170 --> 05:42.070
and well-off
and handsome...

05:42.140 --> 05:45.940
Hey, why should she have
a better husband than you do?

05:46.010 --> 05:47.910
Mrs. Krabappel:
<i>Sodium tetra sulfate
is highly caustic</i>

05:47.980 --> 05:49.550
<i>and can remove your skin.</i>

05:49.610 --> 05:50.880
Say when.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.220
That will do.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.850
What's this stuff for?

05:53.920 --> 05:56.450
It's chiefly used
in the manufacture of
rayons, film

05:56.520 --> 05:59.290
and as a preservative
in fast foods.

05:59.350 --> 06:00.880
It's also
a potent herbicide.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.260
What's a herbicide?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.920
It kills grass.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.550
<i>Excellent.</i>

06:06.630 --> 06:09.230
Must find man.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.900
Must find man.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.770
Must find man.

06:25.450 --> 06:28.890
Boy, a good man
really is hard to find.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.250
Gentlemen, according
to my sources,
you are planning

06:33.320 --> 06:35.190
to simultaneously
drop your pencils

06:35.260 --> 06:37.260
at 2:15 this afternoon.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.600
Do so,
and you will be suspended.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.390
Hey, who squealed?

06:42.460 --> 06:44.630
- You can't get anything past
Principal Skinner.
- He knows everything.

06:44.700 --> 06:50.210
Vandalism fans,
hold onto your hats.

06:50.270 --> 06:50.880
( <i>boys gasping )</i>

06:53.840 --> 06:54.940
Who does he think
he is, anyway?

06:55.010 --> 06:56.280
He's not going
to get away with that.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.850
Sometimes that kid just
goes too far.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.940
One seafood burrito, Apu.

07:06.790 --> 07:07.730
I am loathe to interrupt

07:07.790 --> 07:09.690
your meditation, sir.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.360
But the time has come
for money to change hands.

07:12.430 --> 07:13.230
Oh, sorry.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.020
Say what they will
about our cafeteria

07:32.080 --> 07:36.050
I still think they're the best
Tater Tots money can buy.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.520
Mmm...

07:37.590 --> 07:38.790
( <i>sniffing )</i>

07:38.850 --> 07:40.950
Wait a minute.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.520
It smells like...

07:42.590 --> 07:46.460
sodium tetra sulfate
bonding with chlorophyll.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.200
( <i>sniffing )</i>

07:59.470 --> 08:00.970
Sweet Lord, it is!

08:03.350 --> 08:05.480
Principal Skinner
( screaming: )
<i>Simpson!</i>

08:07.520 --> 08:09.720
Bart,
I'm flabbergasted.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.720
Surely, you knew,
as you writing your own name

08:11.790 --> 08:12.960
in 40-foot high
letters on the field

08:13.020 --> 08:14.290
that you would be caught.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.830
Maybe it was one of
the other Bart's, sir.

08:15.890 --> 08:16.730
There are no other Barts!

08:16.790 --> 08:18.130
Uh-oh.

08:18.190 --> 08:20.350
The sheer contempt
demonstrated by this incident

08:20.430 --> 08:22.400
makes me wish
I could pull

08:22.460 --> 08:24.890
the Board of Education
out of retirement.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.300
Call your father,
immediately.

08:28.340 --> 08:29.570
Hello, is Homer there?

08:29.640 --> 08:30.240
Moe:
Homer, who?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.240
Homer... sexual.

08:33.309 --> 08:36.080
Wait one second.
Let me check.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.210
Uh... Homer sexual?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.179
Come on, come on.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.190
One of you guys
has got to be

08:41.250 --> 08:43.490
Homer sexual.

08:43.549 --> 08:45.760
Don't look at me.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.060
Oh, no--
you rotten little punk.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.020
If I ever get a hold of you

08:51.090 --> 08:53.550
<i>I'll sink my teeth
into your cheek
and rip your face off!</i>

08:53.630 --> 08:54.530
You'll do what, young man?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.230
What, what, wait.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.170
Who is this?

08:57.230 --> 09:00.100
I think the real question is
who is this and where is Homer
Simpson?!

09:00.170 --> 09:02.610
Whoa, whoa, sorry,
Principal Skinner, sorry.

09:02.670 --> 09:05.510
It's a bad connection,
I think.

09:05.570 --> 09:07.370
It's for you.
I think Bart's
in trouble again.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.370
D-ohh!

09:08.440 --> 09:09.900
What's he done now?

09:09.980 --> 09:13.180
I'm afraid this time the victims
are the innocent blades of grass

09:13.250 --> 09:16.290
on Grounds Keeper Willy's
award-winning play field.

09:16.350 --> 09:20.360
If it's alright with you.
I'd like to have Bart
repay his debt to society

09:20.420 --> 09:22.690
through back-breaking
physical labor

09:22.760 --> 09:24.730
resodding the field
manually

09:24.790 --> 09:26.720
seed by seed.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.450
Enough about Bart.

09:42.510 --> 09:45.150
Tell me, Principal Skinner,
are you married?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.310
Only to my job.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.980
But if you weren't married
to your job, you tend to go
for a girl, right?

09:50.050 --> 09:51.890
Well, of course.

09:51.950 --> 09:56.050
These pads come off at night
just like everybody else's.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.990
But tell me,
why all the questions?

09:58.060 --> 10:00.000
No reason.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.070
I was just wondering

10:02.130 --> 10:08.340
if you'd like to come
over to my house for dinner.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.730
A payback for all
the crummy things

10:10.810 --> 10:12.080
Bart has done
to your school.

10:12.140 --> 10:16.350
A home-cooked meal would be
a nice change of pace.

10:16.410 --> 10:18.050
I'd be delighted.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.610
Excellent.

10:22.130 --> 10:24.360
( <i>doorbell rings )</i>

10:24.440 --> 10:25.470
Good evening,
Principal Skinner

10:25.540 --> 10:27.510
and welcome to our home.

10:27.570 --> 10:28.800
Thank you, Bart.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.870
I only hope
for the next few hours

10:30.940 --> 10:33.670
you and I can leave
our differences in the
school yard.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.780
Fine. Just get inside already.

10:35.850 --> 10:37.420
He's here.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.580
What are you waiting for?

10:39.650 --> 10:41.660
Get out there
and shake your
moneymaker.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.820
I'm too nervous.

10:42.890 --> 10:43.690
You do it.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.460
No, you do it.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.480
You do it.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.330
No, you do it.

10:46.390 --> 10:47.190
No, you do it.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.660
Skinner:
<i>Now, Simpson</i>

10:48.730 --> 10:50.430
<i>I had a discomforting thought
on the way over here.</i>

10:50.500 --> 10:53.370
<i>This dinner wouldn't be
a master plan of yours</i>

10:53.430 --> 10:56.370
to set me up with some
unmarried relation, would it?

10:56.430 --> 10:58.960
Because I can assure you
that I...

10:59.040 --> 11:00.170
I...

11:02.140 --> 11:04.580
Oh, be still, my foolish heart.

11:05.710 --> 11:06.850
Here we go.

11:06.910 --> 11:08.020
Boy meets beast.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.020
Ahem.
Principal Skinner,

11:11.080 --> 11:12.910
allow me
to introduce you

11:12.980 --> 11:15.010
to my wife's lovely

11:15.090 --> 11:16.960
and available sister,
Selma.

11:17.020 --> 11:18.530
Hey, tubs, I'm Patty.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.230
What?!

11:19.290 --> 11:21.060
Pat-ty.

11:21.130 --> 11:21.860
D-ohh!

11:21.930 --> 11:22.830
<i>Wrong one.</i>

11:22.890 --> 11:26.190
So, Patty, tell me...

11:26.260 --> 11:28.960
tell me more
about your trip to Egypt.

11:29.030 --> 11:32.300
Nothing more to tell, really.
The Nile smells like
cattle rot

11:32.370 --> 11:34.280
and they've got horseflies
over there the size
of your head.

11:34.340 --> 11:35.440
Marvelous.

11:35.510 --> 11:36.710
Just marvelous.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.610
Well, Selma hated Egypt too.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.680
A camel spit on her.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.650
Oh yes, I've heard they
can be difficult.

11:42.710 --> 11:44.640
Patty, the Parents
Advisory Board has asked

11:44.720 --> 11:46.850
that I attend the premiere

11:46.920 --> 11:49.720
of <i>Space Mutants, Part V
tomorrow night.</i>

11:49.790 --> 11:51.760
Would you be.. interested in
joining me?

11:51.820 --> 11:53.150
( <i>drops silverware )</i>

11:53.220 --> 11:53.920
I don't really...

11:53.990 --> 11:55.660
She'd be delighted.

11:55.730 --> 11:57.130
I'm going to cancel.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.300
No, you're not.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.390
We already have plans
for tomorrow night.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.390
Patty, your first date
in 25 years

12:01.470 --> 12:04.310
is a little more important
than playing hearts with mother.

12:04.370 --> 12:06.740
I tried to repel him,
I really did.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.910
Pack of Lady Laramie 100's,
please.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.910
We both know it could
have easily been me.
Very easily.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.580
Laramie Hi-Tars hard pack,
and I don't have all day.

12:15.650 --> 12:18.420
Here you go.
Smoke them in good health.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.680
And will you be needing
any lottery tickets with that?

12:20.750 --> 12:23.020
No. All right, five.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.330
Stupid Principal Skinner.

12:25.390 --> 12:27.730
You've got to be kidding me.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.550
Save your strength, lad.

12:29.630 --> 12:32.470
There's a whole field
for you to resod yet.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.500
D-ohh!

12:33.570 --> 12:35.600
Bart, you wouldn't
happen to know

12:35.670 --> 12:37.340
what sort of candy

12:37.400 --> 12:39.610
your Aunt Patty likes,
would you?

12:39.670 --> 12:40.770
Cherry cordials, sir.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.380
Very good.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.350
Now then,
regarding your punishment...

12:45.410 --> 12:48.680
Do you feel that you've
learned your lesson?

12:48.750 --> 12:51.620
Have I ever. Just the thought
of doing anything bad again

12:51.680 --> 12:53.340
makes my stomach turn.

12:53.420 --> 12:56.660
Well, then...
you're free to go.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.960
Well Willy, you can take it
from here.

12:58.020 --> 12:59.280
Adios, dude.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.690
You'll be back!

13:00.760 --> 13:02.830
You haven't seen
the last of Willy.

13:06.930 --> 13:09.940
I don't see why
all this is necessary.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.810
Come on Patty, you don't want
to show up for your big date

13:13.870 --> 13:15.410
looking like Yosemite Sam.

13:15.470 --> 13:17.230
How do I look?

13:19.810 --> 13:22.180
Achingly beautiful.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.820
♪ Two and two are four ♪

13:24.880 --> 13:28.810
♪ Four and four are eight ♪

13:28.890 --> 13:31.430
♪ Eight and eight are 16. ♪

13:31.490 --> 13:32.230
Hello.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.330
Cherry cordials.

13:34.390 --> 13:36.320
I hope you like them.

13:36.390 --> 13:37.720
I like them okay.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.830
Let's get this over with.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.840
Excellent suggestion.
I suggest we start

13:41.900 --> 13:43.800
with the Springfield
revolving restaurant.

13:45.740 --> 13:48.810
Skinner:
<i>You know, food tastes better
when you're revolving.</i>

13:48.870 --> 13:50.270
Selma:
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

13:50.340 --> 13:52.880
Well I must say, so far, the
evening is a big disappointment.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.200
Indeed.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.580
Truly terrible.

13:55.650 --> 13:57.620
Hey, can we get
some service

13:57.680 --> 13:59.010
over here?!

13:59.080 --> 14:01.310
I've asked for water
three times now.

14:01.390 --> 14:02.020
Is everything all right?

14:02.090 --> 14:03.420
Well, well, well.

14:03.490 --> 14:05.490
If it isn't
little Jimmy Pierson.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.160
Class of '71, I believe.

14:07.230 --> 14:08.600
Good evening,
Principal Skinner.

14:08.660 --> 14:11.170
Pierson, get this woman
a glass of water immediately.

14:11.230 --> 14:13.170
And tuck in your shirt!

14:13.230 --> 14:14.700
Nearly 30

14:14.770 --> 14:17.300
and still working
as a bus boy.

14:17.370 --> 14:18.710
I'll tell you

14:18.770 --> 14:20.940
the standardized testing
never lies.

14:22.410 --> 14:23.710
Doesn't surprise me.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.980
She's always been
the lucky one.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.340
Two minutes younger.

14:27.410 --> 14:31.020
Skin like a china doll
and bosoms till Tuesday.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.140
Well, don't worry.

14:32.220 --> 14:35.090
There's still plenty
of fish in the sea.

14:35.150 --> 14:36.210
Right, Homer?

14:36.290 --> 14:38.330
Oh, yes,
plenty of fish.

14:38.390 --> 14:40.630
You just don't
have any bait.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.300
Actor:
<i>What a shame.</i>

14:46.360 --> 14:47.420
<i>Out of gas.</i>

14:47.500 --> 14:48.370
Hmm?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.040
<i>( yawns )</i>

14:52.100 --> 14:54.330
Don't be stupid.

14:54.410 --> 14:56.310
Oh, sorry.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.450
Come on, love.

14:59.510 --> 15:00.680
Loosen up.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.680
I just can't forget
what happened

15:02.750 --> 15:04.690
to that poor dingo
back there.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.690
Who or what could have done
such a horrible thing?

15:07.750 --> 15:10.150
It was probably
just a wallaby.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.290
Now come on.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.260
Well... okay.

15:21.130 --> 15:21.790
Ah!

15:21.870 --> 15:24.370
Hello, Dolly.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.310
Oh, that was
the worst movie

15:26.370 --> 15:27.540
I've ever seen.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.810
Not as bad
as the service

15:29.870 --> 15:31.340
at the revolving
restaurant.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.750
Isn't it nice
we hate the same things?

15:38.920 --> 15:41.160
So, see me again tomorrow?

15:41.220 --> 15:44.220
I'm afraid that's
my microwave cookery class.

15:44.290 --> 15:45.860
Then the day after that.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.520
Oh, gee, tae kwon do.

15:48.590 --> 15:50.150
The day after that, then.

15:50.230 --> 15:51.770
Seymour, you're touching me.

15:51.830 --> 15:52.770
Kiss me, Patty.

15:52.830 --> 15:54.030
I don't have cooties.

15:54.100 --> 15:54.970
Hi-ya!

15:59.500 --> 16:02.170
Thursday I'm going
food shopping.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.780
You can come along
if you like.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.070
Until then.

16:07.780 --> 16:09.680
Tell me every
filthy detail

16:09.750 --> 16:11.820
or is your tongue
too tired?

16:11.880 --> 16:14.750
Selma, it was lousy me,
the movie was awful

16:14.820 --> 16:16.560
and he didn't
get anything.
Now g' night.

16:44.620 --> 16:47.490
Patty:
<i>Alright. One kiss, but I don't
want you bragging to your</i>

16:47.550 --> 16:49.060
<i>friends about how you scored.</i>

17:00.850 --> 17:03.890
Oh, I wish I could make
a P.A. announcement

17:03.950 --> 17:06.290
to the whole world.

17:06.349 --> 17:09.980
Attention everyone,
Seymour Skinner is in love.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.660
Oh, wow Simpson,
that's pretty cool.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.160
Bart, Skinner's
going to kill you.

17:13.230 --> 17:15.270
Skinner? Ha!
He works for me now.

17:15.329 --> 17:16.530
<i>Simpson.</i>

17:16.599 --> 17:18.140
What is that there?

17:23.540 --> 17:24.339
<i>Mmm...</i>

17:24.410 --> 17:26.109
Mmm.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.339
Ah, Patty.

17:28.410 --> 17:32.920
Bart, I hate to pull you away
from your daily exercise but..

17:32.980 --> 17:36.350
well I wanted you
to be the first to know.

17:36.420 --> 17:38.720
I'm going to ask for your
Aunt Patty's hand in marriage.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.290
Your funeral, Seymour.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.490
Homer, lighten up.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.660
You're making happy hour
bitterly ironic.

17:45.730 --> 17:49.270
Aw, Moe. I've got to find a date
for my big, fat, snotty

17:49.330 --> 17:50.900
sister-in-law, Selma.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.340
I'm intrigued.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.940
What does Selma
look like?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.540
Like my wife's
ugly sister.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.800
Wheel her in, Homer.

17:56.870 --> 17:58.040
I'm not a picky man.

17:58.110 --> 17:58.880
( <i>belching )</i>

18:01.610 --> 18:02.880
Salesman:
<i>A good rule of thumb</i>

18:02.940 --> 18:04.570
<i>is two years salary, sir.
Try this.</i>

18:04.650 --> 18:06.020
Skinner:
<i>I can't afford that,
I'm an educator.</i>

18:06.080 --> 18:06.880
Seymour.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.350
I'll take it.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.520
Homer, my sister is
not going out with
Barney Gumble.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.860
Homer:
Hey, Selma's
no prize pig herself, you know.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.990
Bart, come cheer up
your Aunt Selma.

18:20.060 --> 18:21.060
Okay.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.970
What did you learn
in school today?

18:23.030 --> 18:24.700
Principal Skinner's gonna
ask Aunt Patty

18:24.770 --> 18:25.640
to marry him.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.310
Mm. Thanks, kid.

18:29.370 --> 18:31.240
You made my day.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.510
But nothing, Marge.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.140
She's a heifer,
plain and simple, and...

18:36.210 --> 18:39.350
oh, there's
the little prom queen now.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.040
Can the sweet talk.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.410
You're right.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.950
It's time to ash can
my girlish hopes and dreams

18:45.020 --> 18:47.620
and grab hold of
the next train out
of the station.

18:55.660 --> 18:58.190
Is that Selma?

18:58.270 --> 19:00.040
Ring-a-ding-ding.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.410
Oh, shut up.

19:01.470 --> 19:04.270
Why are you dolled up
like a chorus girl?

19:04.340 --> 19:06.410
Well, it take
a ripe piece of cheese

19:06.470 --> 19:08.300
to catch the mouse.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.720
It's time to give away my love
like so much cheap wine.

19:11.780 --> 19:13.380
Take it to the hoop, Selma.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.690
Hi, look what I brought.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.860
Ah, schnapps?

19:18.920 --> 19:20.320
I'll take that.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.100
Skinner:
You seem preoccupied tonight,
my little...pudding cup.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.900
Patty:
My sister's on a date

19:27.960 --> 19:29.920
with a big, fat rummy.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.100
Well, there's something up here
that will pick up your spirits.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.540
"Marry me, Patty"?

19:40.610 --> 19:42.110
Geezum crow!

19:42.180 --> 19:44.450
Look at the size
of that rock!

19:44.510 --> 19:47.720
It's the second most precious
jewel in this bell tower.

19:47.780 --> 19:51.590
Patty, the question before you
is, will you marry me?

19:51.650 --> 19:52.910
I don't know.
This is so....

19:52.990 --> 19:55.130
Just say whatever's
in your heart.

19:55.190 --> 19:56.490
<i>Okay.</i>

19:56.560 --> 19:58.960
You see, it's not that
I don't love you.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.230
You love me!

20:00.290 --> 20:02.190
Kalloo kallay!

20:02.260 --> 20:04.220
Yes, yes, but...

20:04.300 --> 20:05.470
But?

20:05.530 --> 20:07.130
But I'm a twin

20:07.200 --> 20:08.570
and as such, I have
a special...

20:08.640 --> 20:10.710
special tie
to your sister. Yes.

20:10.770 --> 20:13.540
The only man I could marry
would have to understand...

20:13.610 --> 20:16.080
That you couldn't leave
your sister for <i>any man.</i>

20:16.140 --> 20:17.000
Oh.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.880
Yes, so I know
you appreciate

20:18.950 --> 20:20.880
why you can never...

20:20.950 --> 20:22.350
See you again?

20:22.420 --> 20:23.650
Exactly.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.520
It's a kind
of a catch-22.

20:29.690 --> 20:32.360
Farewell,
my Patty-cake.

20:32.430 --> 20:35.300
Good night, sweet Principal.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.870
( <i>sobbing )</i>

20:52.950 --> 20:54.150
Bart Simp...

20:58.190 --> 21:04.190
Oh, Springfield Elementary,
I will have you back again.

21:04.260 --> 21:06.060
After all...

21:06.130 --> 21:09.130
tomorrow is another school day!

21:09.200 --> 21:10.400
And then

21:10.460 --> 21:14.290
when I got out
of the service, they, uh...

21:14.370 --> 21:17.340
well, the next few years
are a blur.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.410
Patty, where's Skinner?

21:20.470 --> 21:23.240
We decided
we loved each other enough

21:23.310 --> 21:25.180
never to see
each other again.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.780
I hope I can find
a man like that.

21:27.850 --> 21:30.650
Are you throwing away
your last chance at happiness

21:30.720 --> 21:31.690
just for me?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.010
Yes.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.420
Thanks.

21:34.490 --> 21:36.430
Now let's go
get some pancakes.

21:36.490 --> 21:39.100
Listen, Barney...

21:39.160 --> 21:40.830
Nah.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.670
She broke my heart, Moe.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.240
Don't worry, Barney.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.300
Time heals all wounds.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.040
Well, what do you know?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.230
You're right.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.700
And look.

21:51.770 --> 21:53.530
A whole pitcher
to myself.

21:56.340 --> 21:57.800
( mumbling )
<i>Skinner.</i>

22:00.350 --> 22:01.390
( slurps )

22:02.520 --> 22:04.590
I told you
you'd be back.
