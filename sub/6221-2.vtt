00:01.669 --> 00:05.047
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.131 --> 00:10.219
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.303 --> 00:13.139
His name, Merlin.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.244
| understand you have a shield for me.

00:42.335 --> 00:45.463
With your swordcraft, and this shield,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.298
| guarantee you will win.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.010
-Show me how it works.
-Certainly.

00:51.928 --> 00:53.721
(CHANTING)

00:58.100 --> 00:59.435
(HISSING)

01:00.519 --> 01:03.689
When you're competing in the tournament,

01:03.773 --> 01:08.236
you pin your opponent under the shield,
a snake strikes.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.488
Your opponent will be paralyzed.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.411
The snakes are now under your command.

01:17.495 --> 01:20.623
They'll do anything
that you tell them to do.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.626
-Anything?
-Just say the word.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.424
Kill him.

01:53.656 --> 01:57.451
Knight Valiant of the Western Isles.
I'm here for the tournament.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.036
Welcome to Camelot.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.741
Ready?

02:36.824 --> 02:38.909
Would it make any difference
if I said "no"?

02:38.993 --> 02:40.578
Not really.

02:43.539 --> 02:46.459
Body. Shield. Body. Shield.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.878
-Shield. Head?
-Head! Ow!

02:49.003 --> 02:50.421
Come on, Merlin, you're not even trying.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.256
| am.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.008
-Once more.
-No.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.595
To the left, right, and left. Head!

02:58.763 --> 03:01.474
Come on, Merlin.
I've got a tournament to win.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.559
Can we stop now, please?

03:07.146 --> 03:10.232
-Shield. Body! Shield!
-Shield.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.445
MERLIN: Ow!

03:17.114 --> 03:18.199
(GROANS)

03:18.282 --> 03:22.036
You're braver than you look. Most
servants collapse after the first blow.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.538
-Is it over?
-That was just the warm up.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.749
How's your mace work coming along?

03:34.131 --> 03:38.469
So how was your first day
as Arthur's servant?

03:40.638 --> 03:42.640
Do you hear clanging?

03:44.850 --> 03:47.019
It was horrible,

03:47.144 --> 03:51.732
and I've still got to learn all about
tournament etiquette by the morning.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.236
(CHANTING)

03:58.364 --> 04:01.784
Hoi! What have I told you
about using magic like this?

04:01.867 --> 04:04.120
If I could actually feel my arms,
I'd pick up the book myself.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.164
Never mind your arms,
what do I do if you get caught?

04:07.248 --> 04:09.875
What would you do?

04:09.959 --> 04:14.004
You just make sure
it doesn't happen for both our sakes.

04:14.130 --> 04:17.966
| save Arthur from being killed
and I end up as his servant.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.470
-How is that fair?
-I'm not sure fairness comes into it.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.639
You never know, it might be fun.

04:23.722 --> 04:27.977
You think mucking out Arthur's horses
is gonna be fun?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.603
You should hear my list of duties...

04:29.687 --> 04:32.565
We all have our duties, even Arthur.

04:32.690 --> 04:37.653
It must be so tough for him,
with all the girls, and the glory.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.906
He is a future King.
People expect so much of him.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.868
-He's under a lot of pressure.
-(BONES CRACKING)

04:43.993 --> 04:45.744
That makes two of us.

04:54.420 --> 04:57.673
So, you've got voiders on the arms,

04:57.756 --> 05:02.595
-the hauberk goes over your chest...
-Chest, arms, chest.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.431
| guess you know what to do
with the helmet.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.559
Yeah, that was the only bit
I'd figured out.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.645
How come you're so much
better at this than me?

05:11.729 --> 05:14.315
I'm the blacksmith's daughter.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.942
| know pretty much everything
there is to know about armor

05:17.026 --> 05:20.613
-which is actually kind of sad.
-No, it's brilliant.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.874
You do know the tournament starts today?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.584
Yes, Sire.

05:39.256 --> 05:43.010
-You nervous?
-I don't get nervous.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.678
Really? I thought everyone got nervous.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.388
Will you shut up?

06:03.572 --> 06:06.325
Great. Yeah. I think you're all set.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.745
Aren't you forgetting something?

06:09.828 --> 06:13.624
-My sword?
-Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.752
So you'll be needing that.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.464
That went well.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.973
(CROWD CHEERING)

06:51.245 --> 06:54.665
Knights of the realm,
it is a great honor to welcome you

06:54.790 --> 06:56.542
to the Tournament at Camelot.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.878
Over the next three days, you will
come to put your bravery to the test,

06:59.962 --> 07:01.672
your skills as warriors,

07:01.797 --> 07:04.592
and of course, to challenge
the reigning champion,

07:04.675 --> 07:06.927
my son, Prince Arthur.

07:07.845 --> 07:11.890
Only one can have the honor
of being crowned champion,

07:12.016 --> 07:15.978
and he will receive a prize
of 1,000 gold pieces.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.439
(CROWD MURMURING)

07:18.522 --> 07:22.192
It is in combat that we learn
a knight's true nature.

07:22.276 --> 07:26.447
Whether he is indeed a warrior,
or a coward.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.823
Let the tournament begin!

07:27.948 --> 07:29.325
(CROWD CHEERING)

07:43.339 --> 07:45.883
| trust you will make me proud.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.542
Go on!

08:26.423 --> 08:27.800
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

08:45.859 --> 08:47.236
(CROWD CHEERING)

08:49.405 --> 08:50.572
Yeah!

09:38.078 --> 09:40.706
Knight Valiant looks pretty handy
with a sword.

09:56.847 --> 10:00.601
May I offer my congratulations
on your victories today?

10:00.684 --> 10:02.102
-Likewise.
- I hope to see you

10:02.186 --> 10:04.521
at the reception this evening.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.193
Creep.

10:12.446 --> 10:16.116
For tomorrow, you need to repair
my shield, wash my tunic,

10:16.200 --> 10:20.370
clean my boots, sharpen my sword,
and polish my chain mail.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.225
-Are you using magic again?
-No.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.519
What's all this then?

10:46.063 --> 10:49.149
| just came to tell you
that supper's ready.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.568
(EXHALES)

10:52.402 --> 10:54.488
Knight Valiant of the Western Isles,
my Lord.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.825
| saw you fighting today.
You have a very aggressive style.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.410
As my Lord said,
to lose is to be disgraced.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.080
| couldn't agree more. Knight Valiant,

11:03.163 --> 11:06.208
may I present Lady Morgana. My ward.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.173
My lady.

11:13.257 --> 11:16.426
-I saw you competing today.
- I saw you watching.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.347
| understand the tournament champion

11:20.430 --> 11:22.474
has the honor of escorting
my lady to the feast?

11:22.558 --> 11:24.476
-That's correct.
-Then I will give everything

11:24.560 --> 11:26.144
to win the tournament.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.772
My lady.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.907
-Arthur.
-Father.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.788
They all seem rather impressed
by Knight Valiant.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.125
-They're not the only ones.
-You're not jealous, are you?

11:48.250 --> 11:51.378
| can't see there's anything
to be jealous of.

11:55.424 --> 11:58.135
Could Arthur be any more annoying?

11:58.886 --> 12:01.388
| so hope Knight Valiant
wins the tournament.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.892
-You don't really mean that.
-Yes, I do.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.061
(BELL TOLLING)

12:19.156 --> 12:20.657
(HISSING)

12:20.782 --> 12:21.992
Hello?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.955
Is someone there?

12:29.499 --> 12:31.293
(HISSING CONTINUES)

12:51.146 --> 12:56.026
-Can I help you with something, boy?
-Nope. I'm good.

12:56.860 --> 13:01.531
| was... I was just gathering
my master's armor.

13:04.201 --> 13:07.454
-Then you best be on your way.
-Right. Yeah.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.332
No problem.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.558
-You did all this on your own?
-Yes, Sire.

13:29.393 --> 13:33.063
Now let's see if you can get me into it
without forgetting anything.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.629
That was much better.
Not that it could have got any worse.

13:57.713 --> 14:01.800
-I'm a fast learner.
- I hope for your sake that's true.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.260
Good luck.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.730
(CROWD CHEERING)

14:23.447 --> 14:27.743
Is it my imagination
or are you beginning to enjoy yourself?

14:29.703 --> 14:32.873
It isn't totally horrible all the time.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.918
Yes!

15:13.497 --> 15:17.626
Strike him! Strike him!

15:33.100 --> 15:34.810
| think he's badly hurt.

15:40.649 --> 15:41.900
(GROANING)

15:49.616 --> 15:53.870
-How is he?
-It's most odd. Look at this.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.666
See these two small wounds.
It looks like a shake bite.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.001
How can he have been bitten by a snake?

16:00.085 --> 16:01.211
He was injured in a sword fight.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.880
And yet his symptoms
are consistent with poisoning,

16:03.964 --> 16:07.968
-slow pulse, fever, paralysis.
-Can you heal him?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.887
Well, if it is a snake bite, I'll have
to extract venom from the snake

16:10.971 --> 16:13.014
that bit him to make an antidote.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.684
What happens
if he doesn't get the antidote?

16:15.767 --> 16:19.729
Then I'm afraid there's nothing more
| can do for him. He's going to die.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.779
-He was fighting Knight Valiant.
-What's that?

16:27.863 --> 16:29.197
Nothing.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.056
(SQUEAKING)

16:56.308 --> 16:57.767
Dinner time.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.897
Come on.

17:42.103 --> 17:46.149
I've just seen one of the snakes
on Valiant's shield come alive.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.194
-He's using magic.
-Are you sure?

17:49.277 --> 17:53.114
The snake ate a mouse, one swallow,
straight down.

17:53.949 --> 17:57.369
Ewan was fighting Valiant
when he collapsed.

17:57.452 --> 18:00.664
It must've been one of the snakes
from the shield.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.957
| have to tell Arthur.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.459
Is there a chance you might be mistaken?

18:05.043 --> 18:06.544
| know magic when I see it.

18:06.628 --> 18:10.382
-Perhaps, but have you any proof?
-Don't you believe me?

18:10.465 --> 18:12.759
| fear you'll land yourself in trouble.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.721
How will you explain
why you were in Valiant's chambers?

18:16.805 --> 18:20.016
What does that matter? He's using magic
to cheat in the tournament.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.061
But you can't go accusing a knight
of using magic without proof.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.189
The King will never accept the word
of a servant over the word of a knight.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.275
So what I say
doesn't count for anything?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.652
I'm afraid it counts for very little
as far as the King's concerned.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.612
That's the way it is.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.595
You're telling me
you've got to fight that?

18:57.679 --> 19:01.057
Yes. And he's as strong as a bear
but he's slow.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.394
-And you're fast.
-Exactly.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.865
-You're not worried, are you?
-No.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.927
-How are you getting on?
-Fine.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.598
I'm just doing my job,
minding my own business.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.398
(BOTH GRUNTING)

19:59.032 --> 20:00.367
(ALL CHEERING)

20:37.821 --> 20:40.907
Valiant's going to fight Arthur
in the final.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.786
He'll use the shield to kill him.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.385
(DOOR OPENING)

21:07.350 --> 21:10.603
Merlin, about what I said yesterday.

21:11.479 --> 21:14.190
Look, Uther really wouldn't listen
to you or me.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.194
But you're right.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.698
We can't let Valiant get away with this.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.700
But we don't have any proof.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.993
Well, if we could cure Ewan,

21:25.076 --> 21:27.829
he could tell the king
that Valiant was using magic.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.457
The King will believe another knight.

21:30.540 --> 21:34.544
But how we get the antidote,
well, that's another matter.

21:39.507 --> 21:40.550
Merlin?

21:41.551 --> 21:43.094
(ALL TOASTING)

21:44.262 --> 21:48.975
So, Valiant, do you think
you stand a chance of defeating my son?

21:49.058 --> 21:54.522
He is a great warrior, my Lord.
| do hope to be a worthy opponent.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.486
You should stay in Camelot
after the tournament.

21:59.569 --> 22:02.280
| could do with more knights like you.

22:04.032 --> 22:05.575
I'd be honored, my Lord.

-I'm going to tell Arthur.
-You'll need this.

23:39.711 --> 23:42.714
And, Merlin,
what you did was very brave.

23:48.845 --> 23:52.849
You? You chopped its head off?

23:52.974 --> 23:55.435
Ewan was bitten by a snake from
the shield when he was fighting Valiant.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.854
You can talk to Gaius. You can see
the puncture wounds on Ewan's neck

23:57.937 --> 24:01.441
where the snake bit him.
Ewan was beating him. He had to cheat.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.651
Valiant wouldn't dare
to use magic in Camelot.

24:03.735 --> 24:05.069
Ewan was pinned under Valiant's shield.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.571
No one could see the snake bite him.

24:06.654 --> 24:10.408
| don't like the guy,
but that doesn't mean he's cheating.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.703
Gaius is preparing an antidote
to the snake venom.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.789
When Ewan's conscious,
he'll tell you what happened.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.958
If you fight Valiant in the final,
he'll use the shield.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.127
It's the only way he can beat you.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.378
Look at it.

24:22.462 --> 24:25.298
Have you ever seen
any snakes like this in Camelot?

24:32.347 --> 24:34.724
| know I'm just a servant.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.685
And my word doesn't count for anything.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.687
| wouldn't lie to you.

24:42.273 --> 24:46.027
| want you to swear to me
what you're telling me is true.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.238
| swear it's true.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.868
Then I believe you.

25:24.565 --> 25:25.942
Welcome back.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.861
There was a snake on his shield.

25:29.821 --> 25:31.864
-It came alive...
-You're weak.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.867
The snake's venom
is still in your system.

25:34.951 --> 25:37.328
-I must warn Arthur...
-Arthur already knows.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.580
He's requested an audience
with the King.

25:39.664 --> 25:43.668
Now they'll want to talk to you. Rest.
You'll need your strength.

25:45.503 --> 25:48.673
| need to fetch more herbs.
I'll be right back.

25:53.469 --> 25:54.804
(HISSING)

26:13.531 --> 26:15.533
Why have you summoned the court?

26:16.701 --> 26:19.954
| believe Knight Valiant
is using a magic shield

26:20.037 --> 26:22.123
to cheat in the tournament.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.875
Valiant, what do you
have to say to this?

26:23.958 --> 26:27.170
My Lord, this is ridiculous.
| have never used magic.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.381
Does your son have any evidence
to support this outrageous accusation?

26:30.465 --> 26:32.884
-Do you have any evidence?
- I do.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.105
I'm afraid this potion
tastes like toad water,

26:46.189 --> 26:49.609
but it will get you back on your feet...

26:50.777 --> 26:52.320
Ewan?

26:58.326 --> 27:01.746
-Let me see this shield.
-Don't let him get too close.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.665
Be careful, my Lord.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.506
Merlin?

27:13.633 --> 27:16.010
We need Ewan. Find out what's happening.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.513
VALIANT: As you can see, my Lord,
it's just an ordinary shield.

27:18.596 --> 27:21.140
He's not gonna let everyone see
the snakes come alive.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.935
Then how am I to know
that what you say is true?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.229
| have a withess.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.899
Knight Ewan was bitten by one
of the snakes from the shield.

27:30.316 --> 27:34.904
Its venom made him grievously ill,
however, he has received an antidote.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.491
He'll confirm that Knight Valiant
is using magic.

27:38.574 --> 27:42.537
-Where is this withess?
-He should be here.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.336
Where's Ewan?

27:51.546 --> 27:53.589
-He's dead.
-I'm waiting!

28:09.730 --> 28:12.024
I'm afraid the witness is dead.

28:12.108 --> 28:15.820
So you have no proof
to support these allegations?

28:15.903 --> 28:18.239
Have you seen Valiant using magic?

28:20.533 --> 28:21.784
No.

28:25.746 --> 28:29.834
-But my servant fought the snakes...
-Your servant?

28:30.543 --> 28:33.337
You make these outrageous accusations

28:33.421 --> 28:37.174
against a knight
on the word of your servant?

28:37.258 --> 28:38.968
| believe he's telling the truth.

28:39.051 --> 28:43.055
My Lord, am I really to be judged
on some hearsay from a boy?

28:43.139 --> 28:45.182
I've seen those snakes come alive.

28:45.266 --> 28:48.728
How dare you interrupt? Guards!

28:54.108 --> 28:56.152
-My Lord.
-Wait!

28:59.196 --> 29:01.198
I'm sure he was merely mistaken.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.744
| wouldn't want him punished
on my account.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.664
You see? This is how
a true knight behaves,

29:09.165 --> 29:11.125
with gallantry and honor.

29:12.835 --> 29:15.004
My Lord, if your son made
these accusations

29:15.087 --> 29:17.340
because he's afraid to fight me,

29:17.423 --> 29:20.384
then I will graciously accept
his withdrawal.

29:21.135 --> 29:24.847
Is this true? Do you wish
to withdraw from the tournament?

29:24.931 --> 29:26.015
No.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.852
Then what am I to make
of these allegations?

29:42.657 --> 29:46.202
Obviously, there has been
a misunderstanding.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.998
| withdraw the allegation
against Knight Valiant.

29:53.918 --> 29:57.964
-Please accept my apology.
-Accepted.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.530
| believed you. I trusted you.

30:22.613 --> 30:26.200
You made me look like a complete fool.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.953
| know it didn't go exactly to plan.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.540
Didn't go to plan?

30:34.083 --> 30:38.546
My father and the entire royal court
think I'm a coward.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.047
You humiliated me!

30:43.009 --> 30:45.511
We can still expose Valiant.

30:45.594 --> 30:49.056
- I no longer require your services.
-You're sacking me?

30:49.140 --> 30:52.560
-I need a servant I can trust.
-You can trust me.

30:52.643 --> 30:55.980
And look where it got me this time.
Get out of my sight!

31:32.308 --> 31:33.851
Where are you?

31:37.021 --> 31:41.442
| just came to tell you,
whatever you think my destiny is,

31:41.525 --> 31:44.779
whatever it is that you think
I'm supposed to do,

31:44.862 --> 31:47.490
you've got the wrong person.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.497
That's it.

31:59.502 --> 32:00.795
Goodbye.

32:03.714 --> 32:08.302
DRAGON: If only it was so easy
to escape one's destiny.

32:10.179 --> 32:13.307
How can it be my destiny
to protect someone who hates me?

32:13.390 --> 32:17.394
A half cannot truly hate
that which makes it whole,

32:17.478 --> 32:20.439
very soon you shall learn that.

32:21.232 --> 32:25.069
Ah, great. Just what I needed,
another riddle.

32:25.152 --> 32:30.491
That your and Arthur's path
lies together is but the truth.

32:31.033 --> 32:34.620
-What is that supposed to mean?
-You know, young warlock,

32:34.703 --> 32:37.164
this is not the end.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.875
It is the beginning.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.467
Just give me a straight answer!

32:59.061 --> 33:01.772
-Hello, Merlin.
-All right.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.865
Is it true what you said
about Valiant using magic?

33:15.703 --> 33:17.371
What're you gonna do?

33:17.454 --> 33:20.624
Why does everyone seem to think it's
down to me to do something about it?

33:20.708 --> 33:24.003
Because it is, isn't it?

33:26.505 --> 33:30.217
You have to show everyone that
you were right and they were wrong.

33:30.301 --> 33:32.052
And how do I do that?

33:33.721 --> 33:35.014
| don't know.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.231
That's it.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.402
Where're you going?

33:55.409 --> 33:56.952
Do you have a wheelbarrow?

34:02.082 --> 34:03.959
What're you doing with that?

34:04.043 --> 34:07.922
I'm going to let everyone see
the snakes for themselves.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.444
(CHANTING)

35:01.350 --> 35:02.935
Arthur!

35:05.980 --> 35:07.356

35:23.330 --> 35:25.374
(CHANTING)

35:36.385 --> 35:38.137
(EXHALING)

35:47.980 --> 35:50.524
| thought I told you
to get out of my sight.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.527
Don't fight Valiant
in the final tomorrow.

35:55.029 --> 35:57.489
-He'll use the shield against you.
- I know.

35:57.865 --> 36:00.576
Then withdraw. You have to withdraw...

36:00.659 --> 36:03.412
Don't you understand? I can't withdraw.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.206
The people expect their prince to fight.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.375
How can I lead men into battle
if they think I'm a coward?

36:08.459 --> 36:10.878
Valiant will kill you.
If you fight, you die.

36:10.961 --> 36:12.546
Then I die.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.925
How can you go out there
and fight like that?

36:18.510 --> 36:22.598
Because I have to. It's my duty.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.214
(ROOSTER CROWING)

36:56.256 --> 36:57.800
(CHANTING)

37:37.005 --> 37:38.257
Let me.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.895
| used to help my father with his armor.

38:04.575 --> 38:05.826
Thanks.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.543
Arthur?

38:18.297 --> 38:19.715
Be careful.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.972
See you at the feast.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.242
(YELLS)

39:28.325 --> 39:29.910
(CHANTING)

39:33.038 --> 39:34.414
(GROWLING)

39:42.089 --> 39:43.215
(BARKING)

39:46.885 --> 39:48.220
| did it!

39:58.146 --> 40:01.650
-Arthur's fighting Valiant.
-I know. I'm on my way.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.862
Whatever you do, don't go into my room.
I'll deal with it later.

40:17.374 --> 40:19.126
(BOTH GRUNTING)

41:53.929 --> 41:55.263
(CHANTING)

41:57.432 --> 41:58.767
(HISSING)

42:02.354 --> 42:05.857
What're you doing? I didn't summon you!

42:06.692 --> 42:08.443
He is using magic!

42:08.568 --> 42:11.113
And now they see you
for what you really are.

42:18.578 --> 42:19.913
Kill him!

42:24.584 --> 42:26.044
Arthur!

42:38.473 --> 42:41.476
Looks like I'm going to the feast
after all.

42:45.272 --> 42:46.648
(ALL CHEERING)

43:29.691 --> 43:31.777
My honorable guests.

43:31.860 --> 43:34.988
| give you Prince Arthur, your champion!

43:41.536 --> 43:44.164
-My lady.
-My champion.

43:45.707 --> 43:49.294
See? I told you he gets all the girls
and the glory.

43:49.377 --> 43:52.297
And he owes it all to you.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.550
Has your father apologized yet
for not believing you?

43:55.675 --> 43:57.761
He'll never apologize.

43:57.886 --> 44:01.181
| hope you're not disappointed
that Valiant's not escorting you?

44:01.264 --> 44:04.392
Turns out he wasn't really
champion material.

44:06.228 --> 44:09.564
-That was some tournament final.
-Tell me about it.

44:09.689 --> 44:13.109
It's not every day
a girl gets to save her prince.

44:13.693 --> 44:16.363
| wouldn't say I needed exactly saving.

44:16.446 --> 44:18.615
I'm sure I would've
thought of something.

44:18.698 --> 44:21.910
So you're too proud to admit
that you were saved by a girl?

44:22.035 --> 44:24.329
Because I wasn't.

44:24.412 --> 44:27.123
You know what?
| wish Valiant was escorting me.

44:27.249 --> 44:30.085
Me, too.
Then I wouldn't have to listen to you.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.878
-Fine.
-Fine.

44:37.384 --> 44:39.427
Can you believe Morgana?

44:39.553 --> 44:43.473
She says she saved me.
Like I needed any help.

44:47.602 --> 44:50.438
| wanted to say, I made a mistake.

44:52.274 --> 44:54.276
It was unfair to sack you.

44:58.071 --> 45:00.282
Don't worry about it.

45:00.407 --> 45:02.659
Buy me a drink. We'll call it even.

45:02.784 --> 45:06.246
| can't really be seen
to be buying drinks for my servant.

45:08.790 --> 45:12.377
Your servant? You sacked me.

45:12.460 --> 45:15.755
And now I'm rehiring you.
My chambers are a complete mess.

45:15.839 --> 45:19.634
My clothes need washing,
my armor needs repairing,

45:19.759 --> 45:23.722
my boots need cleaning,
my dogs need exercising,

45:23.805 --> 45:27.309
my fireplace needs sweeping,
my bed needs changing

45:27.434 --> 45:30.812
and someone
needs to muck out my stables.

45:35.108 --> 45:38.278
We have to discover
how this illness is spreading.

45:38.361 --> 45:40.697
-We're searching every room in town.
-GAIUS: What for?

45:40.780 --> 45:42.240
-A sorcerer.
-What have you done

45:42.324 --> 45:44.200
with the magic book I gave you?

45:44.284 --> 45:47.120
The most likely cause is sorcery.

45:48.163 --> 45:49.164
-Gwen!
-What have I done?

45:49.247 --> 45:51.124
| haven't done anything.
Please, no. I'm innocent.

45:51.207 --> 45:54.794
-It was me.
-Merlin, you will pay for this.

45:54.878 --> 45:57.672
No, please. Help me!
