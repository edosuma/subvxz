10:28.836 --> 10:30.171
Cool! What does it do?

10:30.254 --> 10:33.090
Whatever you draw with it
becomes a real version of that thing.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.759
No way! Like what?

10:34.842 --> 10:36.886
Like a door. Or a motorcycle.

You guys drew a motorcycle,

We… We got the key, but…

Gordie didn't make it. Gideon killed him.

Oh my God!

Wait, where's Sam?

10:51.942 --> 10:54.320

Wait. What? What does that mean?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.327
I think it means…
I think it means he's dead too.

11:01.952 --> 11:05.247
But we… we don't have a lot of time.
Gideon's on his way here right now.

-It's protected by magic.
-[breathing heavily]

11:11.671 --> 11:13.089
Okay. If we can't get the Alpha Key,

11:13.172 --> 11:15.966
then we have to find a way
to get Gideon in the well house.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.595
Or maybe we can use the Creation Key
to draw some weapons.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.391
Or both.

Here I am, boy.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.634
You're looking for these, right?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.805
You insult my intelligence.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.765
As if I don't know the rule.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.101
Did you honestly believe

12:07.184 --> 12:11.313
that I would just walk through that door
and disappear for you?

12:12.523 --> 12:16.152
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Oh, no, of course not.

I guess you've got me.

But no…

12:37.965 --> 12:42.178
you have some clever little trick.

29:04.492 --> 29:07.704
Kins, there's… there's good.
There's great.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.458
And then there's like…
like another tier of excellent.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.586
And that's where you find us.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.004
[chuckles]

29:16.087 --> 29:18.006
[romantic music playing]

29:27.724 --> 29:29.142
[all laughing]

29:29.225 --> 29:32.645
And then we took a kayak
to the Rock Islands

29:32.729 --> 29:35.064
and went for a swim in the lake.
It was amazing.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.358
Totally worth
the multiple jellyfish stings.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.611
The fact that the lake
is literally called Jellyfish Lake

29:39.694 --> 29:41.237
should have prepared us for that.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.866
I've driven on the Highway to the Sun.
It doesn't literally go to the sun.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.242
[Nina] So what you're saying is,

29:46.326 --> 29:48.411
"Don't have Duncan
book our next family vacation."

29:48.495 --> 29:50.288
[Duncan] Well, that's a bit hyperbolic.

29:50.371 --> 29:53.333
I do have tamer options available
for the timid.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.627
-[Duncan laughs]
-We miss anything exciting here?

29:59.589 --> 30:02.008
Well, I was assaulted
at the Meeting House.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.512
And then my car was stolen and totaled.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.431
So anyone who tells you
that there is less crime in a small town

30:08.515 --> 30:10.225
has never been to Matheson, Massachusetts.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.811
-Did they catch them?
-No, not even any leads.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.564
But on the plus side, that means I can
test drive some new rides this afternoon.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.732
[Brian] Oh.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.567
Need any help?

30:22.153 --> 30:23.363
Really?

30:23.446 --> 30:28.243
Sure. I'm an excellent negotiator,
and I'll make sure you don't get swindled.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.371
-That would be great.
-[laughter]

30:31.454 --> 30:32.747
[Bode] Oh my goodness!

30:32.831 --> 30:34.833
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

30:37.252 --> 30:38.586
-Shotgun!
-Oh man!

30:38.670 --> 30:40.964
-[Jamie] You snooze, you lose!
-[Nina] Good luck. [chuckles]

30:41.047 --> 30:44.425
-You sure you don't wanna come?
-Oh, I'm quite sure. Have fun.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.469
-Bye.
-Bye.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.102
That's good to see
that Bode's finally warming up to Josh.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.229
Yeah, he scored some extra points

30:56.312 --> 30:58.815
when Bode heard
that he rammed Gideon with his car.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.317
Even though Josh can't remember doing it.

31:01.401 --> 31:02.235
Is that weird?

31:02.318 --> 31:05.613
-[chuckles] No. Not as bad as I thought.
-[horn honks]

31:06.406 --> 31:08.658
On the other side,
there would have been so many questions,

31:08.741 --> 31:11.327
but now we can just all move on together.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.121
Clean slate.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.164
And the well house?

31:16.207 --> 31:18.960
[Nina] I was thinking
I might put up a greenhouse there.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.420
[Duncan] I love that idea.

31:20.503 --> 31:24.340
Or, and I'm just spitballing here,
a little guest house

31:24.424 --> 31:26.509
for when your favorite brothers-in-law
come to visit.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.177
-Throw in a hot tub.
-[Nina laughs]

31:28.261 --> 31:30.305
-Not sure that's gonna happen.
-[Duncan laughs]

31:30.388 --> 31:33.892
But you'll always have your room upstairs
for when you come and visit often.

31:33.975 --> 31:37.478
No, Josh is for sure gonna turn that
into his man cave or something.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.481
Oh, funny. No, it's yours.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.067
Always.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.862
-[emotional music playing]
-[sighs]

31:45.945 --> 31:47.071
[chuckles softly]

31:47.155 --> 31:49.073
[Nina chuckles]

31:49.157 --> 31:51.326
-[Duncan sighs]
-[Nina chuckles]

31:53.244 --> 31:54.829
[birds chirping]

31:59.042 --> 32:02.629
Okay, so we've got
plenty of sandwich stuff in the fridge,

32:02.712 --> 32:04.130
and I'll be home before dinner.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.425
Oh crap! Is that toothpaste?

32:07.508 --> 32:09.302
-[Rufus] Mom.
-[sighs]

32:10.595 --> 32:11.804
You've got this.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.390
[sighs deeply]

32:16.017 --> 32:17.769
[inhales deeply] Are you good?

32:18.353 --> 32:22.065
Yeah, just finishing
the last chapter of Squadron Strange.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.234
Impressive.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.780
So do Sergeant E and her troops
eventually find their way back home?

32:30.198 --> 32:32.533
They realized they already were home.

32:33.534 --> 32:36.496
[inspirational music playing]

32:38.957 --> 32:40.667
[Ellie kissing] See you later.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.751
Break a leg.

32:42.710 --> 32:45.254
We're so thrilled
you've decided to come back.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.256
Thanks. Feels good.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.843
The timing couldn't be more perfect,
with fall sign-up starting today.

32:52.428 --> 32:53.471
[Ellie] Can't wait.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.561
-[chuckling]
-Hopefully, we get a decent turnout.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.397
I think you could say that.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.148
Welcome back, Coach Whedon.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.317
[students cheering and applauding]

33:12.031 --> 33:14.033
[Ellie laughing]

33:22.583 --> 33:24.585
[indistinct cheer]

33:34.929 --> 33:37.140
[Carly on phone] You're just lucky
I sweet-talked Glen

33:37.223 --> 33:38.599
into giving you your job back.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.560
[Tyler] Yeah, I hear the talent pool

33:40.643 --> 33:43.813
for underpaid, overworked
construction workers in Montana is vast.

33:43.896 --> 33:45.398
You know you love it.

33:45.481 --> 33:48.484
I do, actually.
Looking forward to getting back.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.820
But first, road trip.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.363
[Tyler] Yeah, so if I make good time,

33:52.447 --> 33:54.866
I should be able to meet you in Nashville
by Tuesday morning.

33:54.949 --> 33:58.119
Ooh, and we have to stop in Colorado
at the UFO Watchtower.

33:58.202 --> 34:02.290
For sure. Plus, maybe a little detour
into Baja, California.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.917
Where Glen will be calling
to fire us both.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.086
[chuckles]

34:08.171 --> 34:10.339
[Bode] Why are we packing your car now?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.008
Because I'm heading out at sunrise,

34:12.091 --> 34:14.969
and I know what you're like
when you have to get up before 8:00.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.680
Yeah, and we've officially retired
from battling monsters.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.098
[Bode] Hey!

34:19.182 --> 34:21.142
I threw some breakfast bars in here.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.560
Sorry. [laughs]

34:22.643 --> 34:25.021
-I couldn't help myself.
-Thanks.

34:25.104 --> 34:26.439
So, can we come visit you?

34:26.522 --> 34:29.400
Of course, but I'll be back
in the fall for your birthday.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.485
With Carly?

34:32.111 --> 34:33.237
Possibly.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.156
I already invited her.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.367
What? We text.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.038
[inhales deeply]

34:42.121 --> 34:43.247
[sighs]

34:43.331 --> 34:45.333
[nostalgic music playing]

34:48.586 --> 34:50.588
I never thought I'd say this, but…

34:52.298 --> 34:53.841
I'm gonna miss this place.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.595
Even if it's a little Norman Bates.

34:59.305 --> 35:02.183
-Turns out it was a lot Norman Bates.
-[Nina and Kinsey chuckle]

35:02.892 --> 35:04.644
Who's Norman Bates?

35:05.561 --> 35:06.687
[Kinsey chuckles]

35:06.771 --> 35:08.940
[joyful orchestral music playing]

35:15.696 --> 35:16.614
[Bode] Wait.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.867
Do you guys hear that?

35:23.246 --> 35:24.205
Hear what?

35:27.875 --> 35:29.127
What are you hearing?

35:32.672 --> 35:33.673
Nothing.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.050
Absolutely nothing.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.678
[sweeping orchestral music playing]

35:55.820 --> 35:56.946
[music stops abruptly]

35:57.029 --> 35:59.615
[indistinct whispering]

36:00.491 --> 36:02.493
[music resumes]

36:06.581 --> 36:08.082
[music ends]

36:10.168 --> 36:12.170
[lively instrumental music playing]
