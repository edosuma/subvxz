WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.406
Now that you are a department head,

00:03.505 --> 00:05.339
I really want you out there
as the face of social.

00:05.374 --> 00:09.033
<i>I am "Scarlet" magazine's
first black female department head.</i>

00:09.077 --> 00:10.609
I could write all about
how my mom was dying

00:10.644 --> 00:12.578
from breast cancer when
I was in kindergarten.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.414
You are positive for a
mutation in the BRCA1 gene.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.349
Look, I made a mistake running around

00:17.385 --> 00:19.385
with Brooke Langley,
and I just want you to know

00:19.420 --> 00:20.619
that I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.288
How cute is this guy? And he's a doctor.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.277
What is your stance on pre-marital sex?

00:26.312 --> 00:27.559
I think we're good.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.700
I just saw in our magazine that
this position is called a "Face-Off."

00:34.735 --> 00:36.602
What?

00:36.637 --> 00:39.471
Sorry, sometimes I just can't
stop being a "Scarlet" writer.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.344
Wait, it's really called "Face-Off"?

00:45.379 --> 00:46.745
- Like the Nic Cage movie?
- Yeah.

00:51.650 --> 00:52.751
Sorry.

00:52.787 --> 00:55.554
I keep seeing Nicolas Cage's face.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.724
A lil' better.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.303
I'll...

01:11.338 --> 01:12.538
What, are you seeing Nicolas Cage again?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.573
No, the condom broke.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.284
<i>- Are you there yet?</i>
- No, not yet.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.552
<i>I still don't believe
that they'd Postmate</i>

01:26.587 --> 01:28.554
<i>the morning-after pill.</i>

01:28.589 --> 01:31.390
<i>That's because you live on
the blissful island of Sappho</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:32.624
<i>where people don't have to
worry about birth control.</i>

01:32.660 --> 01:33.759
<i>Trust me, it's a thing.</i>

01:33.794 --> 01:35.661
Okay, well, it better be a thing.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.429
Look, I really think you
and I can handle this, Jane.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.599
<i>Oh, look, Ben. You should know by now
that we are a package deal.</i>

01:40.634 --> 01:42.401
<i>You buy one;
you get the other two for free.</i>

01:42.436 --> 01:43.735
Okay, when is this guy getting here?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.637
As long as you take it
within 72 hours we're good.

01:45.673 --> 01:49.341
Which means we still have
70 hours and 55 minutes.

01:50.494 --> 01:51.543
Okay, that must be him.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.479
<i>Oh, Jane. Turn your phone
to face the computer</i>

01:53.514 --> 01:54.680
<i>so that when I say, "I told you so,"</i>

01:54.715 --> 01:55.837
<i>I can see Kat's face.</i>

01:55.917 --> 01:57.749
Okay, I have to go. Bye.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.718
<i>Told you it was a thing.</i>

02:01.422 --> 02:03.455
Delivery for Jane Sloan?

02:03.491 --> 02:05.324
- That's me.
- Oh, hi.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.293
Dude at the pharmacy
wanted me to tell you this:

02:08.329 --> 02:10.496
"Take it as soon as possible.
It will cause nausea,

02:10.531 --> 02:13.465
and please consider using a
contraceptive in the future."

02:13.501 --> 02:15.400
Yeah, we were.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.437
For the record,
my girlfriend is very responsible, so...

02:18.472 --> 02:20.339
Did you just call me your girlfriend?

02:20.374 --> 02:22.508
I did. I hope that's okay.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.711
Yeah, just... you don't have to
because the whole condom thing.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.746
No. No. No. I've actually
wanted to for a while.

02:28.749 --> 02:32.284
Can I officially call you my girlfriend?

02:32.319 --> 02:33.652
Yeah, you can.

02:37.625 --> 02:41.693
Ah, hmm. Please. Please, take this. Now.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.363
Thank you.

02:48.318 --> 02:49.516
<i>How you holding up?</i>

02:49.570 --> 02:52.280
These side effects are
really kicking my ass.

02:52.315 --> 02:53.572
Sorry.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.374
You know, the same thing
happened to me when I took

02:55.409 --> 02:56.742
the morning-after pill,
but the good news

02:56.777 --> 02:59.311
is Oliver's in Paris so
I can use his juicer.

02:59.346 --> 03:03.415
And I can make you a mango,
pineapple, turmeric smoothie.

03:04.129 --> 03:05.650
- That didn't help.
- No.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.418
- I'll take one.
- Okay.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.686
Hey.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.357
- Hey.
- Hi, what are you doing here?

03:12.393 --> 03:14.593
I'm... actually I'm freelancing
for "Porch & Garden."

03:14.628 --> 03:17.396
Hemp: it's the new corn.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.699
Don't judge.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.303
- Rough night?
- No, not really.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.472
Stomach flu? Pregnant?
Morning-after pill?

03:27.508 --> 03:29.308
Food pois...

03:29.343 --> 03:33.345
Oh, okay. Jane, wild woman.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.514
Kat Edison?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.382
Hi. I'm Cleo Williams.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.450
I'm Safford's newest board member.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.551
Oh, hi.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.686
You know, you're a bit of a legend

03:40.721 --> 03:42.454
- up in the board room.
- Oh.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.423
I was wondering if I could
have a word with you.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.691
- Sure.
- Great.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.693
Great.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.297
<i>Kat, have you ever heard of Whole Spa?</i>

03:52.333 --> 03:54.700
They make the cleansers with
the rainbow labels, right?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.435
Yes, that's them.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.470
They have a line of
inclusive beauty products.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.339
They also make it a point to cater

04:00.374 --> 04:02.474
to women of all ages and skin types.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.243
And they've come to me

04:04.278 --> 04:06.378
with an opportunity for
product integration.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.281
Okay, so you want my team
to start Insta-ing about them?

04:09.316 --> 04:11.283
Actually, they want you.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.452
You would be the face of the campaign.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.620
Me?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.355
Yes, they want to feature you

04:16.390 --> 04:18.322
in a series of Whole Spa
Instagram stories.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.627
Kat, you are the youngest
head of a department at the magazine.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.462
That is exactly the type of influencer

04:23.497 --> 04:25.297
that they want associated
with their products.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.466
Sorry, did you just
call me an influencer?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.434
Listen, you are incredibly charismatic,

04:29.470 --> 04:32.471
and you really have this
unique identity and story.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.506
They just want to sit down
with you this afternoon

04:34.541 --> 04:36.675
and have a little chat
about the campaign.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.677
Would that be okay?

04:39.780 --> 04:43.315
- Sure, okay.
- I will let them know.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.666
Don't forget about us when you become
a famous spokesperson.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.703
I believe the term that she
used was actually influencer.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.372
Oh.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.541
- Okay, this is pretty good.
- Yeah.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.576
Told you not to doubt the
turmeric mango smoothie.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.612
So how long is Oliver in Paris for?

05:13.647 --> 05:14.713
Like, five days.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.548
Well, I could get used to these.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.450
Well, it's not all smoothies
and espresso drinks.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.471
I'm in charge of inventory, schedule,

05:20.488 --> 05:22.122
and the budget meeting today.

05:22.123 --> 05:24.589
See, someone's back
in Oliver's good graces.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.526
- Hmm, it speaks.
- Yeah.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.594
And it hurts.

05:30.058 --> 05:31.530
I say this with love,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.332
but you look terrible.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.501
I feel nauseous and...

05:36.537 --> 05:39.404
my head hurts, and my boobs hurt,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.606
and I'm dizzy. Is this normal?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.442
I think you should call your doctor

05:43.477 --> 05:45.344
because she will probably
be able to prescribe

05:45.379 --> 05:47.312
you something to offset
the side effects.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.547
I don't need to call my doctor.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.282
I am dating one.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.650
She works it into literally...

05:51.685 --> 05:53.618
Every conversation.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.620
Hello. I'm right here.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.723
Hello, Jane.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.624
Do you think Ben got weird last night

05:59.660 --> 06:01.259
because of the religious stuff?

06:01.295 --> 06:02.661
No, it was fine.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.364
He's Christian,
not a character on "Handmaid's Tale."

06:07.401 --> 06:09.234
Hi.

06:09.636 --> 06:13.672
Yeah, no,
I'm still throwing up and stuff.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.408
Any suggestions?

06:16.443 --> 06:20.479
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thanks. Bye.

06:21.068 --> 06:22.414
So what did he say?

06:22.449 --> 06:24.282
He said I should call my doctor

06:24.318 --> 06:26.385
and see if she could give me
anything to fight the nausea.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.686
Wow.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.356
I'm not gonna say, "I told you so."

06:31.392 --> 06:32.691
- But we told you so.
- Okay.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.293
I'm done with both of you.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.701
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.737
So you ready for your
first budget meeting?

06:45.773 --> 06:48.440
Yeah, got my little
espresso and all this stuff.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.575
Oliver said the hardest
part is staying awake.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.278
Actually he told me to smile and nod

06:53.313 --> 06:56.548
and not sit next to Bob.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.317
He doesn't believe in deodorant.

07:00.621 --> 07:04.289
Okay, let's get this party started.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.224
First, with the good news.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.494
The board has approved
the expansion of the Paris issue.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.531
Which means more of us can
go to Paris for Fashion Week.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.500
Of course they are going
to extract a pound of flesh

07:15.536 --> 07:18.503
in exchange, and they're asking
for cuts on the upcoming issue

07:18.539 --> 07:20.305
to cover the Paris overages.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.606
So let's just rip that
Band-Aid right off

07:21.642 --> 07:24.342
and start with Bob in distribution.

07:24.378 --> 07:25.710
Can we cut 10% out of
this month's budget?

07:25.746 --> 07:27.379
Yes.

07:27.414 --> 07:30.248
Felicia, can you get 15% out of events?

07:30.284 --> 07:31.383
I can do 10%.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.351
All right, and another 10%

07:33.387 --> 07:34.719
out of the fashion
department this month.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.389
Oh, that's right, Sutton,
you're covering today, welcome.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.624
I'm sure Oliver prepped you and, so,

07:39.660 --> 07:42.360
can we get 10% out?

07:42.396 --> 07:44.329
One second.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.265
We need to talk about where
that $20,000 went for travel...

07:47.301 --> 07:49.501
- It's midnight in Paris; he's probably sleeping.
- _

07:49.536 --> 07:51.403
Sutton, would be really great to get

07:51.438 --> 07:54.573
an answer before we have
to put this issue to bed.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.708
Well, he did say smile and nod.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.643
Sure.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.416
All right. Great. Great.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.351
Onward.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.521
Side effects should
start subsiding soon.

08:09.556 --> 08:12.624
I'm just gonna give you a prescription
for some anti-nausea medication.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.626
Just to be on the safe side.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.497
Thank you. I feel better already.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.600
Wonderful, and this is probably
a good time to start

08:21.635 --> 08:24.369
talking about your fertility plan.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.404
Fertility plan?

08:26.440 --> 08:29.541
You need to be thinking about whether
or not you want to have children.

08:31.413 --> 08:32.544
But I'm only 25.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.480
You're also a carrier
of BRCA gene mutation.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.482
- That is a game changer for you.
- Why?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.251
I've been doing all the screenings.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.620
I know.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.524
I know, but you should
understand that the most

08:45.559 --> 08:48.460
effective preventative
treatment involves

08:48.495 --> 08:50.595
- an oophorectomy.
- Oopherectomy?

08:50.631 --> 08:53.431
The medical term for having
your ovaries removed.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.700
You need to start thinking not

08:55.736 --> 08:57.602
just about prophylactic
measures but what

08:57.638 --> 09:00.305
your reproductive plans are, long-term.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.374
I-I don't understand.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.243
If kids are in your future,

09:05.279 --> 09:07.379
you need to start thinking about it now.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.600
So if I trim a couple hundred

09:17.636 --> 09:19.569
from the Marc Jacobs accessories spread,

09:19.604 --> 09:24.307
and I cut Thursday's "Divas and Dives"
shoot budget in half...

09:24.342 --> 09:26.442
I can make our new number.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.344
- Look at you.
- Yeah.

09:28.380 --> 09:31.648
Finally putting that
finance degree to work.

09:31.683 --> 09:33.416
Oh, no, what's wrong?

09:33.451 --> 09:35.184
- Fashion closet.
- Yeah.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.090
Do you want me to come
to the fashion closet too?

09:37.125 --> 09:38.354
Do you want to?

09:38.390 --> 09:39.589
I'm just gonna tell her
about my appointment

09:39.624 --> 09:42.325
I just had with my gyno.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.526
I'ma sit this one out.

09:43.561 --> 09:45.528
Mm-hmm.

09:47.332 --> 09:50.233
So you have to start thinking
about having kids now?

09:50.268 --> 09:51.567
Sort of.

09:51.603 --> 09:54.203
I have to start thinking
about thinking about it.

09:54.239 --> 09:56.406
Reese Witherspoon had
a baby when she was 22.

09:56.441 --> 09:58.408
Adele was 24.

09:58.443 --> 10:00.376
And Lauren always told
me that the best place

10:00.412 --> 10:03.546
to network was at those
"Mommy and Me" play date things.

10:03.581 --> 10:05.415
- That's not helping.
- No.

10:07.319 --> 10:09.319
Do you want kids?

10:10.355 --> 10:12.588
I don't know. I always thought I might.

10:12.624 --> 10:15.525
But it was like a distant future thing.

10:15.560 --> 10:20.330
Like flying cars or needing Botox.

10:20.365 --> 10:23.333
When I try to picture myself
with kids, I just... I can't.

10:23.368 --> 10:24.667
Would you ever consider doing it alone?

10:24.703 --> 10:27.403
You know, like, with a sperm bank.

10:27.439 --> 10:29.272
Like, with a turkey baster?

10:29.307 --> 10:32.308
Or how about the
old-fashioned sperm delivery:

10:32.344 --> 10:34.277
Ben's penis.

10:34.642 --> 10:35.678
Okay.

10:35.714 --> 10:38.448
It's a little too soon
to be talking about that.

10:38.483 --> 10:40.316
Ben just called me his girlfriend

10:40.352 --> 10:42.418
- for the first time last night.
- You made it official.

10:42.454 --> 10:45.254
Which is why it's too soon
to be putting this on him.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.390
I haven't even told him
about my BRCA status.

10:47.425 --> 10:50.259
I need to figure out what I want
before I drag him into it.

10:50.295 --> 10:51.461
How you gonna do that?

10:51.496 --> 10:55.498
Well, I get paid to ask questions
about things I want to know, so...

10:56.735 --> 10:58.701
I guess I'll just do that.

11:00.672 --> 11:04.540
I cannot tell you how thrilled we are
about the prospect of working together.

11:04.576 --> 11:07.477
Well, you actually can tell me
'cause you just did.

11:08.713 --> 11:12.515
That's the edgy Kat Edison sensibility
we're so excited about.

11:12.550 --> 11:15.585
So what kind of Insta campaign
were you guys thinking about?

11:15.620 --> 11:17.420
We want you to make
the stories your own.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.288
- Really?
- We do.

11:19.324 --> 11:21.290
You can riff on anything you want to.

11:21.326 --> 11:23.226
All we ask if that you
mention our cleansers

11:23.261 --> 11:25.294
and three things you like about them.

11:25.330 --> 11:28.364
Well, I've actually never used
Whole Spa products before.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.699
You'll love them.

11:29.734 --> 11:32.635
Organic, no animal testing,
biodegradable packaging,

11:32.670 --> 11:34.537
totally carbon neutral.

11:34.572 --> 11:37.573
We make products for women
of all ages and colors.

11:37.609 --> 11:40.376
Products designed to empower them,

11:40.412 --> 11:42.278
not make them feel like
they need to live up

11:42.313 --> 11:45.314
to some artificial standard of beauty.

11:45.350 --> 11:49.252
We just need you to give us
permission to use your image.

11:51.423 --> 11:53.589
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

11:54.659 --> 11:57.593
Kat, you found a way to use
your "Scarlet" platform

11:57.629 --> 12:00.363
to make strong feminist statements.

12:00.398 --> 12:02.632
This is just a continuation
of that journey.

12:05.537 --> 12:08.237
Okay.

12:08.273 --> 12:12.241
- Well, I'm sold.
- Great.

12:12.277 --> 12:14.477
<i>I want to be wowed.</i>

12:14.512 --> 12:16.612
Stalker or Rom Com hero?

12:16.648 --> 12:18.648
When is coming on strong, too strong?

12:18.683 --> 12:20.349
Didn't you write about
the fine line between

12:20.385 --> 12:22.418
love and suffocation last month?

12:22.454 --> 12:23.686
Yes and no.

12:23.721 --> 12:25.555
Might be time to ditch
the clingy boyfriend.

12:25.590 --> 12:27.423
Alex, what do you got for me?

12:27.459 --> 12:30.493
The intersectional
appeal of Meghan Markle.

12:30.528 --> 12:32.328
I love that. Great.

12:32.363 --> 12:33.496
Jane, what about you?

12:33.531 --> 12:35.498
You've been awfully quiet.
What do you got?

12:35.533 --> 12:38.501
I want to do a piece on
20-something-year-old mothers.

12:38.536 --> 12:42.505
You know, how do they do it?
How do they balance careers?

12:42.540 --> 12:44.674
Do they have a sex life?

12:44.709 --> 12:46.375
It's interesting,

12:46.411 --> 12:47.643
but I'm not sure it's right for you.

12:47.679 --> 12:52.348
Well, I hear the best networking happens
at those "Mommy and Me" classes.

12:52.383 --> 12:55.318
So how about...

12:55.353 --> 13:00.423
are babies the next must-have accessory
for young professionals?

13:00.458 --> 13:02.358
Yeah, I like it. It's good.

13:02.393 --> 13:04.427
Go talk to some young moms.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.400
Really?

13:11.436 --> 13:14.437
- Allow me.
- Hey.

13:14.472 --> 13:15.671
Look who's a gentlemen.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.440
I don't know what James
told you about me,

13:17.475 --> 13:18.916
but I do have manners.

13:19.310 --> 13:22.278
- And also unsuspected depth.
- Very unsuspected.

13:23.481 --> 13:26.482
- Someone's birthday?
- No, it's my swag actually.

13:26.518 --> 13:29.619
I'm, like, a spokesperson for Whole Spa.

13:29.654 --> 13:31.621
- You're a spokesmodel?
- Spokesperson.

13:31.656 --> 13:35.458
I'm just gonna be featured in some
of their Instagram stories.

13:35.493 --> 13:37.226
You're not the only one
with surprising skills.

13:37.262 --> 13:38.461
Whole Spa, huh?

13:38.496 --> 13:40.363
Why'd you say it like that?

13:40.398 --> 13:42.598
I have a friend who's doing
a deep dive into the company,

13:42.634 --> 13:44.430
running an exposÃ© on them for "Vice."

13:44.465 --> 13:45.568
Huh, what kind of exposÃ©?

13:45.603 --> 13:48.671
Well, you know how supposedly
they're super progressive?

13:48.706 --> 13:51.707
Turns out their CEO is a big donor
to the Family Research Council

13:51.743 --> 13:53.643
and the Council of
Conservative Citizens.

13:53.678 --> 13:57.413
Aren't those, like,
racist, anti-LGBTQ groups?

13:57.448 --> 13:59.649
Big time.

13:59.684 --> 14:02.351
Now I know why they wanted
me to do it so badly.

14:02.387 --> 14:04.487
I mean, who better
to inoculate the company

14:04.522 --> 14:06.622
when the story breaks
than a queer black woman.

14:06.658 --> 14:09.292
- Yeah.
- I see.

14:09.327 --> 14:11.394
Sorry.

14:14.499 --> 14:18.267
So they want you to be
their black bi bandaid?

14:18.303 --> 14:20.336
To cover up their racist,
homophobic boo-boo.

14:20.371 --> 14:21.604
What are you gonna do?

14:21.639 --> 14:23.472
Sure as hell not gonna be their mascot.

14:26.277 --> 14:27.995
- Oliver?
- Who else?

14:27.996 --> 14:28.996
_

14:30.381 --> 14:33.316
Hey, Oliver, I just got your text.

14:33.351 --> 14:35.551
The only thing is when
you told me to nod,

14:35.587 --> 14:38.354
I just... I thought
that meant say yes, so...

14:39.490 --> 14:41.624
I know.

14:41.659 --> 14:44.460
I know, okay, well, bonsoir.

14:47.365 --> 14:50.366
Long-distance,
pissed-off Oliver is so much worse

14:50.401 --> 14:52.235
than up-close-and-personal,
pissed-off Oliver.

14:52.270 --> 14:54.337
He just found I want
to cut the budget for

14:54.372 --> 14:56.170
the "Divas and Dive" shoot
to make our new number.

14:56.205 --> 14:57.473
I thought that was a good thing.

14:57.508 --> 14:59.675
Well, the problem is now
we can't afford the location,

14:59.711 --> 15:02.245
and shooting at Chad's
was the only reason

15:02.280 --> 15:03.479
Oliver wanted to do the spread.

15:03.514 --> 15:06.482
So basically it's my
first budget meeting...

15:07.018 --> 15:08.384
and I blew it.

15:08.419 --> 15:12.455
Hey, so who wants to go on a field trip?

15:12.490 --> 15:14.423
- Where are we going?
- Hecksher playground.

15:14.459 --> 15:16.292
- I've been juicing.
- Thank you.

15:16.327 --> 15:18.494
I found a play group of
20-something-year-old moms

15:18.529 --> 15:20.329
and their kids.

15:20.365 --> 15:22.331
Cool.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.267
Okay, are you gonna talk to some moms?

15:24.302 --> 15:25.534
'Cause I have to go
back to the office soon.

15:25.570 --> 15:27.503
I just... I want to watch
for a little longer.

15:27.538 --> 15:30.239
It's like Margaret Mead
found a new tribe.

15:30.275 --> 15:31.813
Yeah, breeders.

15:32.243 --> 15:35.645
Okay, I'm just trying to see
if I can picture myself here.

15:36.322 --> 15:38.414
Aren't you guys curious?

15:38.449 --> 15:42.285
No, not really, but then again
I'm pretty sure I don't want kids, so...

15:42.320 --> 15:44.253
Why not?

15:44.289 --> 15:46.555
I don't know, first of all,
environmental reasons.

15:46.591 --> 15:49.225
There are already too many
of us and too few resources.

15:49.260 --> 15:52.428
Yeah, I do, but I think
it's cause my mom sucked.

15:53.431 --> 15:55.698
You know, I'd love
the opportunity to do better.

15:55.733 --> 15:59.535
Give my kid or kids the
childhood I never had.

16:01.372 --> 16:05.241
I'm not seeing the allure
of being a human Kleenex.

16:05.276 --> 16:07.276
Okay, I'm going in.

16:07.312 --> 16:09.412
- Excuse me, hi.
- Hi.

16:10.310 --> 16:12.448
I'm a writer for "Scarlet" magazine,

16:12.483 --> 16:16.252
and I'm doing a story on
20-something-year-old moms

16:16.287 --> 16:17.553
and I was wondering if I could talk

16:17.588 --> 16:19.488
- to you for a few minutes?
- Sure.

16:19.524 --> 16:22.191
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.

16:22.226 --> 16:24.293
I work as a waitress at night

16:24.329 --> 16:26.329
so I have more time
for Jacob during the day.

16:26.364 --> 16:30.366
But, not gonna lie,
I'm tired every minute

16:30.401 --> 16:32.668
of every day.

16:32.704 --> 16:35.338
But then I look at his sweet face,

16:35.373 --> 16:37.306
and I know it's all worth it.

16:37.342 --> 16:39.642
How has parenthood
affected your relationship?

16:39.677 --> 16:42.278
My husband and I have
to work at it more.

16:42.313 --> 16:45.214
So we make sure to have at least
two date nights a month.

16:45.249 --> 16:46.515
How do you juggle it all?

16:46.551 --> 16:48.351
My mom.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.586
I couldn't do it without her.

16:50.621 --> 16:52.688
She takes the kids on our date nights

16:52.724 --> 16:54.623
and takes them on the
weekends whenever she can

16:54.659 --> 16:56.292
so I can catch up on some work.

16:56.327 --> 16:57.426
Mama! Help me.

16:57.462 --> 16:58.627
Could you just hold him for a sec?

16:58.663 --> 17:00.629
I have to go catch Tilly.

17:00.665 --> 17:04.532
I'm coming, Tilly.

17:04.569 --> 17:05.458
Hey, Jane!

17:05.503 --> 17:08.570
- Jane, come over here!
- This is so much fun!

17:20.599 --> 17:23.733
_

17:31.083 --> 17:32.743
Wanna go out for dinner?

17:33.785 --> 17:34.679
I guess.

17:36.174 --> 17:38.583
- Italian or Chinese?
- I don't know.

17:38.618 --> 17:41.319
Well, how about Burgers and Brews?

17:41.354 --> 17:43.487
Or Pauly G's or we could
try that new place...

17:43.523 --> 17:44.789
Maybe I don't want to have to choose.

17:44.824 --> 17:47.325
Maybe I don't know what I want.

17:51.531 --> 17:55.633
Are you still feeling nauseous
from the morning-after pill?

17:55.668 --> 17:57.435
No, I'm just...

17:57.470 --> 17:59.403
I'm just really stressed
about this article.

18:00.473 --> 18:02.506
What are you writing about?

18:02.542 --> 18:04.575
Just "Scarlet" stuff.

18:04.611 --> 18:06.444
Totally get it.

18:06.479 --> 18:08.412
I'll leave you alone.

18:08.448 --> 18:10.514
I'm sorry, it's just...

18:10.550 --> 18:14.685
writer's block and surging hormones
are not a great combo.

18:19.392 --> 18:20.591
If you do have a breakthrough,

18:20.627 --> 18:22.660
I'm not working
till tomorrow afternoon, so...

18:22.695 --> 18:24.562
Okay.

18:27.634 --> 18:30.501
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:37.510 --> 18:39.410
Hello, Jacqueline.

18:39.445 --> 18:40.645
- Oh, hi, Sutton.
- Hi.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.580
Is this a really bad time?

18:42.615 --> 18:45.483
Well, admittedly eyebrow
threading is never a good time.

18:46.013 --> 18:48.319
What can I help you with?

18:48.354 --> 18:50.321
Remember when I said that
the fashion department

18:50.356 --> 18:53.370
could cut 10% of their budget
for next month's issue?

18:53.405 --> 18:55.559
I do.

18:55.595 --> 18:59.664
Turns out we can't cut as
much as I thought we could.

18:59.699 --> 19:02.633
So I just need a little bit more money

19:02.669 --> 19:05.703
to make the "Divas and Dives"
shoot tomorrow work.

19:05.738 --> 19:07.705
Yeah, see, the problem, Sutton,

19:07.740 --> 19:09.573
is that the budget is already locked,

19:09.609 --> 19:12.410
and the time to ask for
more money would have been

19:12.445 --> 19:13.611
at yesterday's meeting,
which is why we had,

19:13.646 --> 19:15.479
you know, the meeting.

19:15.515 --> 19:17.314
Of course.

19:17.350 --> 19:18.616
It's just Oliver...

19:18.651 --> 19:20.484
Yeah, Oliver always wants the moon,

19:20.520 --> 19:23.487
and, you know, you just
don't always get the moon so...

19:23.523 --> 19:25.656
so what else can you give him?

19:31.531 --> 19:33.698
I can't write this.

19:38.671 --> 19:42.473
You really have that much
to say about Meghan Markle?

19:43.302 --> 19:45.743
Her marriage to Prince Harry made
a strong progressive statement.

19:45.778 --> 19:48.579
They even had eco-friendly
flowers in their ceremony.

19:48.614 --> 19:50.381
Good for them.

19:50.416 --> 19:53.417
How is the
"Babies are the new Bling" coming?

19:53.453 --> 19:55.786
It's coming.

19:55.822 --> 19:58.322
So far all labor, no baby.

19:59.726 --> 20:02.626
They only want me so
that then when their CEO

20:02.662 --> 20:04.428
is ousted as a racist homophobe,

20:04.464 --> 20:05.629
he can point to me and say,

20:05.665 --> 20:08.666
"Oh, look, some of my best spokespeople
are black lesbians."

20:08.701 --> 20:10.701
When I was negotiating the
product integration deal,

20:10.737 --> 20:12.570
I had no idea.

20:12.605 --> 20:15.740
You know, their image
was so politically correct.

20:15.775 --> 20:17.775
Okay, so can we just walk away?

20:17.810 --> 20:20.478
I've been looking over your
contract for a way out,

20:20.513 --> 20:22.379
a morality clause or
something like that,

20:22.415 --> 20:23.681
but there's nothing.

20:23.716 --> 20:25.683
What are they going
to do if I just refuse

20:25.718 --> 20:27.618
to post an Instagram story?

20:27.653 --> 20:29.553
For starters, they could sue us
for breach of contract.

20:29.589 --> 20:31.689
Which would be incredible
expensive for Safford

20:31.724 --> 20:33.758
and a legal nightmare
for the two of you.

20:33.793 --> 20:36.694
I'm so sorry, Kat.

20:36.729 --> 20:38.629
<i>You really think Sutton's
gonna get this place for free?</i>

20:38.664 --> 20:41.398
<i>I hope so. She really needs it
for this photo shoot.</i>

20:41.434 --> 20:43.701
Oh, well, she's smiling.
That's a good sign.

20:43.736 --> 20:45.770
Yeah, but, see, her arms are crossed.

20:45.805 --> 20:47.772
That's not really,
"You can have your photo shoot

20:47.807 --> 20:50.474
here for free," kind of body language.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.843
Oh, it looks like she's
complimenting the place.

20:52.879 --> 20:54.812
Wow, she's pulling out all the stops.

20:54.847 --> 20:56.547
And how are you?

20:56.582 --> 20:58.783
Are you thinking about
thinking about kids?

20:58.818 --> 21:01.719
No, because every time
I start to think about it,

21:01.754 --> 21:04.688
I wind up feeling sick
and having a panic attack

21:04.724 --> 21:06.624
and I just don't know
how to get past it.

21:06.659 --> 21:08.325
What about you?

21:08.361 --> 21:09.660
Have you figured out
what you're gonna do

21:09.695 --> 21:11.532
- about the Whole Spa thing?
- No.

21:11.632 --> 21:15.466
I have to post my first
Instagram story tomorrow

21:15.501 --> 21:18.402
and I'm still trying to figure
out how I can get out of it.

21:18.437 --> 21:20.371
But right now the best idea I have

21:20.406 --> 21:22.573
is to just bury it in basic hashtags.

21:22.608 --> 21:25.376
Ooh. The basic hashtag trick.

21:25.411 --> 21:26.677
It's a good one.

21:26.712 --> 21:28.712
- Hi, so?
- What's up?

21:28.748 --> 21:30.781
No.

21:32.485 --> 21:33.818
She said they can't afford
to shut the place down

21:33.853 --> 21:36.720
for the shoot even if it's
only for a couple of hours.

21:40.593 --> 21:43.427
Why does Oliver have to have it here?

21:43.462 --> 21:47.565
You know, he bought his first beer here
when he moved to the city.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.401
So the whole shoot is kind
of inspired by this place.

21:50.436 --> 21:52.436
I mean, look at it. It's...

21:52.471 --> 21:54.805
It's like a movie set.

21:58.845 --> 22:00.744
A set.

22:07.486 --> 22:10.321
I use Whole Spa clean wipes
in the middle of the day

22:10.356 --> 22:11.755
because it's a great pick me up.

22:11.791 --> 22:14.792
My skin feels soft,
hydrated, and most of all

22:14.827 --> 22:16.727
I feel like a damn hypocrite.

22:16.762 --> 22:18.329
Okay.

22:18.364 --> 22:20.397
I don't think that it's in your DNA

22:20.433 --> 22:22.566
to do this without calling them out.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.702
Nope. It's not.

22:26.706 --> 22:30.574
But, you know, they did say
that they wanted

22:30.610 --> 22:34.445
that edgy Kat Edison sensibility, so...

22:34.480 --> 22:36.380
maybe I should give them just that?

22:40.265 --> 22:42.652
I think I would rather save the close-up

22:42.687 --> 22:46.656
of the Neon Geode lips until after
the edible essential oil section.

22:46.691 --> 22:48.524
Jane, do you have a sec?

22:48.560 --> 22:51.527
Also, do we have another
photo of Michael B. Jordan?

22:51.563 --> 22:53.429
He is just so beautiful;

22:53.465 --> 22:55.365
everybody's gonna think he's CGI.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.367
We are putting Blake Lively
and her two daughters

22:57.402 --> 22:59.669
on the cover, and your piece
is gonna be the featured story.

22:59.704 --> 23:01.637
That's great.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.373
So when do I get to
see your rough draft?

23:03.726 --> 23:06.776
It's just taking me a little longer
than I thought it would.

23:06.811 --> 23:10.546
You having trouble finding mothers
who are wanting to go on the record?

23:10.582 --> 23:12.548
No, no, that's... that's not it.

23:12.584 --> 23:14.584
Well, if you're finding that

23:14.619 --> 23:16.686
focusing on the trendy
aspect of young motherhood

23:16.721 --> 23:18.621
is... is slowing you down,
then you can just throw out

23:18.656 --> 23:20.423
the babies as accessory angle.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.426
I mean, maybe something
about fourth-wave feminists

23:23.461 --> 23:25.495
who are trying to have it all sooner.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.630
Something that explores
how and why young women

23:27.665 --> 23:29.532
just hitting adulthood
would want to take on

23:29.567 --> 23:31.701
this kind of responsibility.

23:31.736 --> 23:33.536
- Right?
- Yeah.

23:33.571 --> 23:36.472
That is really interesting.
I'll explore that angle.

23:36.508 --> 23:38.641
Great. Well, I can't wait to read it.

23:40.412 --> 23:42.545
Oh, well, this is looking a lot better.

24:00.765 --> 24:03.299
Okay, bottom line is
if I'm going to recreate

24:03.334 --> 24:04.700
Chad's in the Scarlet photo studio

24:04.736 --> 24:07.570
I have $233 for set dec and props.

24:07.605 --> 24:09.405
Yeah, that's almost impossible.

24:09.441 --> 24:12.775
Yes, but not if you grew up
shopping at flea markets.

24:13.608 --> 24:14.677
Don't be afraid to haggle.

24:14.712 --> 24:16.712
We need 30 black and
white framed photos...

24:16.748 --> 24:18.481
ideally New York-y stuff...

24:18.516 --> 24:19.940
- three clocks.
- Do they have to work?

24:20.018 --> 24:22.418
They don't because the
ones at Chad's are broken.

24:22.454 --> 24:24.320
A large screen TV, a chalkboard,

24:24.355 --> 24:25.588
darts, dartboard,

24:25.623 --> 24:27.356
some old maps, sofa and chairs.

24:27.392 --> 24:29.525
- All for under 233?
- 218, actually.

24:29.561 --> 24:30.726
We need money for a
cab back into the city.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.563
Thank you guys so much for doing this.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.765
No problem, just be ready to make

24:35.800 --> 24:37.600
me one of those smoothies when
Jacqueline gives me her whole

24:37.635 --> 24:40.369
"You haven't handed in your piece"
face tomorrow.

24:40.405 --> 24:41.804
I'm on it. Ready?

24:41.840 --> 24:43.573
It's just shopping, right?

24:43.608 --> 24:45.708
Except we're buying stuff nobody wants
with money we don't have.

24:45.743 --> 24:47.410
Exactly.

24:47.445 --> 24:48.711
Go team.

24:51.483 --> 24:53.549
- 15!
- I'll give you 10.

24:53.585 --> 24:55.651
Gimme the 10.

24:55.687 --> 24:57.687
Thank you.

24:57.722 --> 24:59.655
How much is the TV?

25:01.326 --> 25:02.625
- Is that a character?
- Pirate.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.727
10? Here.

25:04.762 --> 25:06.596
Sweet, thank you.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.297
I'll take this too.

25:09.501 --> 25:11.334
Thank you so much. You're a doll.

25:19.511 --> 25:22.345
Oh.

25:27.519 --> 25:30.353
Okay, neon sign. Check.

25:30.388 --> 25:32.788
Photo of Bella Abzug. Check.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.657
- Think we did it.
- Yep.

25:34.692 --> 25:36.526
Uber truck is three minutes away.

25:36.561 --> 25:38.594
So that means we should be
unloading at "Scarlet"

25:38.630 --> 25:40.530
in, like, half an hour.

25:40.565 --> 25:41.764
Oh, we do have to make a pit stop.

25:41.799 --> 25:43.332
- What?
- Yeah.

25:43.368 --> 25:44.534
I thought we got everything?

25:44.569 --> 25:46.602
Almost everything.

25:48.706 --> 25:52.675
There has to be a better way to get
the plastic cups from Chad's.

25:52.710 --> 25:55.411
Eh, not for free.

25:56.614 --> 25:58.414
Jackpot!

26:03.017 --> 26:04.520
<i>I am exhausted.</i>

26:04.556 --> 26:06.522
<i>That's what happens
when you work all night.</i>

26:06.558 --> 26:08.457
On the upside, you did it.

26:08.493 --> 26:11.460
Well, let's see what Oliver
has to say from Paris

26:11.496 --> 26:13.529
once he gets the photos
I'm about to send him.

26:13.565 --> 26:15.364
He's gonna love it.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.666
Come on, we got to go.

26:16.701 --> 26:18.668
We smell a little too
dumpster for my taste.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.536
Oh.

26:20.572 --> 26:23.506
See, the thing is,
is you guys smell like dumpster,

26:23.541 --> 26:26.375
I smell like roses.

26:26.704 --> 26:27.677
No, you don't.

26:27.712 --> 26:29.412
- What?
- She's right.

26:29.447 --> 26:30.546
- You don't.
- You stank.

26:30.582 --> 26:33.382
I promise. I would know.

26:36.487 --> 26:39.455
So you're not even bothering
getting dressed at home anymore?

26:39.490 --> 26:41.791
Oh, they were helping me get ready for
the "Divas and Dives" shoot all night.

26:41.826 --> 26:43.526
Won't say a word.

26:43.561 --> 26:44.755
You're not the only ones
who've had to borrow

26:44.763 --> 26:47.463
an Eliza J maxi dress in
a desperate time of need.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.434
Oh, Jane.

26:51.469 --> 26:52.768
Jacqueline would like to
see you in her office.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.605
She really wants your young moms piece.

27:03.475 --> 27:06.643
<i>So your young mothers piece.</i>

27:07.799 --> 27:10.380
Why are you struggling with it?

27:11.031 --> 27:11.915
I don't know.

27:12.154 --> 27:13.329
I...

27:13.771 --> 27:18.555
I guess I just haven't found an angle
that really works for me yet.

27:21.627 --> 27:24.294
Okay.

27:26.365 --> 27:27.698
It feels too personal.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.333
Jane, if you...

27:30.369 --> 27:32.736
think that you're pregnant
or that you might be...

27:32.771 --> 27:36.440
No. No. It's... it's nothing like that.

27:40.713 --> 27:43.447
Okay, it's a little like that.

27:46.685 --> 27:50.620
I never told you this, but...

27:50.656 --> 27:55.525
I found out that I'm positive
for the BRCA gene mutation.

27:56.562 --> 28:00.397
Oh, Jane, I am so sorry.

28:02.468 --> 28:04.334
I had no idea.

28:05.437 --> 28:08.338
Yeah, I haven't really
told a lot of people.

28:10.609 --> 28:12.542
But the thing is,
is I have a lot of decisions

28:12.578 --> 28:14.578
that I have to make
in the next few years.

28:14.613 --> 28:18.548
Like what kind of preventative
surgery I want to have if any.

28:18.584 --> 28:20.751
And whether or not I want to have kids,

28:20.786 --> 28:23.687
and if I do,
I either need to freeze my eggs

28:23.722 --> 28:26.289
or think about getting pregnant, so...

28:26.325 --> 28:29.292
Well.

28:29.328 --> 28:32.696
That is a lot to handle.

28:32.731 --> 28:35.432
Especially when you're 25.

28:36.335 --> 28:39.336
Yeah.

28:39.371 --> 28:42.372
I don't really know how to
start thinking about it.

28:42.407 --> 28:45.275
Have you talked to your
friends about this?

28:45.310 --> 28:47.377
Yeah.

28:47.412 --> 28:49.546
And, I mean, I know they care,

28:49.581 --> 28:51.615
but they don't really know what to say.

28:54.319 --> 28:56.386
Jane.

28:56.789 --> 29:00.624
I hope you know that I
am always here to talk...

29:00.659 --> 29:03.360
about anything.

29:04.396 --> 29:06.263
Thank you.

29:07.399 --> 29:09.599
And don't worry.

29:09.635 --> 29:13.236
- I'll get the article done.
- Oh.

29:13.272 --> 29:16.540
I am not worried about that.

29:17.609 --> 29:20.302
But if it's tripping you up,
writing about

29:20.346 --> 29:25.415
young 20-somethings who've
chosen to have kids,

29:25.450 --> 29:29.352
then just write about
why you're not ready yet.

29:34.493 --> 29:36.726
Thank you.

29:36.762 --> 29:40.430
I'll think about it.

29:45.504 --> 29:46.469
<i>Right over here, sweetheart.</i>

29:46.505 --> 29:48.405
<i>Look away.</i>

29:48.440 --> 29:50.740
<i>That's it. Beautiful.</i>

29:53.512 --> 29:54.511
Yeah, that lighting is perfect.

29:54.546 --> 29:56.413
It's amazing. I love it.

29:56.448 --> 29:58.582
Go get some more stuff.

30:01.687 --> 30:03.353
Oh, my God.

30:03.388 --> 30:05.322
Looks so good.

30:05.357 --> 30:06.590
Oh, yeah.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.525
- Literally would never know.
- Yay.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.695
Kat, I'm gonna need you to come with me.

30:11.730 --> 30:14.431
Yes.

30:17.636 --> 30:19.569
<i>I use Whole Spa clean wipes</i>

30:19.605 --> 30:22.539
<i>in the middle of the day because
it's a great pick-me-up.</i>

30:22.574 --> 30:26.409
<i>My skin feels soft, hydrated,
and most of all, clean.</i>

30:26.445 --> 30:28.578
<i>It's as if all the
dirt's been wiped away.</i>

30:28.614 --> 30:31.448
<i>Just like how the CEO
of Whole Spa, Eric Miller,</i>

30:31.483 --> 30:33.416
<i>is hoping that having
a queer black woman</i>

30:33.452 --> 30:35.719
<i>featured on their Instagram
story will just wash away</i>

30:35.754 --> 30:39.723
<i>all the bad press he's about to get
for donating to hate groups.</i>

30:42.461 --> 30:43.793
They might try and sue us.

30:43.829 --> 30:46.563
I did everything I was
contractually obligated to do.

30:46.598 --> 30:48.331
I used the cleanser,

30:48.367 --> 30:50.333
listed three things
that I liked about it.

30:50.369 --> 30:52.602
Are these allegations against
the Whole Spa CEO true?

30:52.638 --> 30:54.537
I just spoke with the reporter;

30:54.573 --> 30:57.407
he has multiple sources,
and the story just broke on "Vice."

30:57.442 --> 30:58.642
Did you know about this?

30:58.677 --> 31:00.543
When you agreed to the
product integration?

31:00.579 --> 31:02.379
No, of course not.

31:02.414 --> 31:04.381
But this is still a very
important partnership.

31:04.416 --> 31:09.286
And if we're being honest,
not everyone at Safford is woke.

31:09.321 --> 31:10.620
I mean, Elliot Waxman
from "Porch & Garden"

31:10.656 --> 31:12.555
has been spotted on
more than one occasion

31:12.591 --> 31:15.392
wearing a MAGA hat while golfing.

31:15.427 --> 31:16.626
Well, maybe you should see
if he could do

31:16.662 --> 31:18.561
the next Whole Spa Instagram story.

31:21.333 --> 31:25.368
This is precisely why "Scarlet"
doesn't do advertorials.

31:25.404 --> 31:27.504
It betrays the trust of our readers.

31:27.539 --> 31:29.572
When they pick up an issue of
"Scarlet" magazine,

31:29.608 --> 31:32.742
they expect us to have an
authentic point of view.

31:32.778 --> 31:35.312
I was just trying to
increase our revenue stream.

31:35.347 --> 31:37.414
Well, that's a noble goal.

31:37.449 --> 31:39.683
But neither Kat,
nor "Scarlet" 's integrity

31:39.718 --> 31:42.352
should be up for sale.

31:49.761 --> 31:51.461
- Should we go get a drink?
- Yes.

31:51.496 --> 31:53.730
I wish. I have to go home.

31:53.765 --> 31:55.532
Ben is coming over,
and I'm gonna tell him

31:55.567 --> 31:57.334
what's been going on.

31:57.369 --> 31:58.768
So you know, super fun night.

31:59.566 --> 32:01.738
I'm sorry. But telling Ben is good.

32:01.773 --> 32:03.473
Yeah, he's your boyfriend now.

32:03.508 --> 32:05.275
Which means you get sex on the regular

32:05.310 --> 32:06.643
and he needs to know stuff like this.

32:07.423 --> 32:08.611
Oh, speaking of boyfriends,

32:08.647 --> 32:11.648
I just got an all-caps
happy text from Oliver.

32:11.683 --> 32:13.650
- Wow.
- _

32:13.685 --> 32:16.453
- Followed by an angry one.
- _

32:16.488 --> 32:18.321
Hmm.

32:19.691 --> 32:21.725
Okay, but be forewarned,

32:21.760 --> 32:25.495
S-U-Q is a word,
and I will be playing it.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.700
Um... So, hey.

32:30.736 --> 32:33.536
I have to talk to you about something.

32:33.572 --> 32:34.771
You already apologized
for the other night

32:34.806 --> 32:36.539
and thanked me for the flowers.

32:36.575 --> 32:38.541
I promise you we're good.

32:39.544 --> 32:41.611
It's... it's not about that.

32:43.382 --> 32:45.782
Remember when I told you

32:45.817 --> 32:47.684
how my mom died from breast cancer?

32:50.555 --> 32:52.789
Well, I...

32:52.824 --> 32:57.527
I found out that I'm positive
for the BRCA mutation.

32:59.398 --> 33:01.631
Oh, Jane.

33:04.569 --> 33:06.469
I'm sorry.

33:09.674 --> 33:12.509
Yeah, I...

33:12.544 --> 33:15.345
I found out, like, four months ago,

33:15.380 --> 33:16.679
and I thought that the only thing

33:16.715 --> 33:19.282
I needed to worry about
were the screenings.

33:19.317 --> 33:21.584
But when I saw my doctor the other day

33:21.620 --> 33:23.586
for the side effects, she told me I need

33:23.622 --> 33:25.722
to start thinking about what kind of

33:25.757 --> 33:27.590
preventative measures I wanted to take

33:27.626 --> 33:30.627
and whether or not I want to have kids.

33:32.731 --> 33:35.365
Oh, Jane.

33:37.569 --> 33:39.469
Well.

33:40.472 --> 33:42.405
That's a lot.

33:42.774 --> 33:45.608
The mutation, is it in BRCA1 or BRCA2?

33:45.644 --> 33:47.710
- BRCA1.
- Okay.

33:50.715 --> 33:54.350
And your mother's breast cancer,
was that estrogen sensitive? Because...

33:54.386 --> 33:56.319
Ben.

33:56.354 --> 33:59.389
I need you to act like
my boyfriend right now,

33:59.424 --> 34:01.524
not a doctor.

34:02.427 --> 34:04.260
Yeah, I'm sorry.

34:06.465 --> 34:08.364
You are having regular
mammograms, right?

34:08.400 --> 34:09.527
Yes.

34:09.601 --> 34:11.668
And trans-vaginal ultrasounds
to check for ovarian cancer...

34:11.728 --> 34:14.571
Ben.

34:14.606 --> 34:18.541
I didn't tell you so that you could
give me medical advice.

34:18.577 --> 34:21.311
I told you because...

34:21.346 --> 34:23.379
I want you to know what's been going on.

34:26.318 --> 34:29.385
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to process this.

34:31.422 --> 34:33.556
I know what this means
in ways other guys don't.

34:33.592 --> 34:35.525
Yeah.

34:37.661 --> 34:40.295
Right now I kind of wish you didn't.

34:45.637 --> 34:48.771
Look, can we just go back
to playing the game,

34:48.806 --> 34:51.373
and just forget I said anything?

34:51.409 --> 34:53.443
Okay?

35:10.498 --> 35:12.276
We tried to pretend
like everything was normal.

35:12.285 --> 35:15.752
But we both knew that it wasn't, so...

35:15.787 --> 35:18.388
I'm sorry, love.

35:20.458 --> 35:22.759
I mean, I don't know
what I expected him to do.

35:22.794 --> 35:28.498
It was cancer, surgery,
potential parenthood,

35:28.533 --> 35:31.768
just wrapped up in one
delightful little package.

35:35.507 --> 35:38.541
Okay, well, let's tackle this
one thing at a time.

35:38.577 --> 35:40.476
You love lists.

35:40.512 --> 35:43.713
And if ever a situation
demanded a pro-con list,

35:43.748 --> 35:47.617
deciding whether or not you
want to have a kid would be it.

35:47.652 --> 35:49.452
I know.

35:51.423 --> 35:52.855
But I don't think I can.

35:52.891 --> 35:56.593
Okay, look, this is probably
the last thing you want to hear,

35:56.628 --> 35:58.394
but I'm the child of two shrinks.

35:58.430 --> 36:01.564
So I think parents are the
root of all of our issues.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.766
Do you think that maybe the reason

36:03.802 --> 36:08.404
you're having trouble picturing yourself
as a mom is because...

36:08.440 --> 36:10.607
you lost yours when you were so young?

36:13.478 --> 36:14.777
Maybe.

36:16.548 --> 36:19.349
I mean...

36:19.384 --> 36:22.552
I only have memories of
my mom when she was sick.

36:24.689 --> 36:26.789
I don't remember anything before that.

36:30.862 --> 36:33.529
And I just keep thinking, like...

36:35.500 --> 36:38.501
Was she the kind of mom who...

36:38.536 --> 36:43.606
got down on the floor and played
with me when I was a kid or...

36:43.642 --> 36:45.775
did my hair...

36:45.810 --> 36:49.646
or read me bedtime
stories and sang to me?

36:52.417 --> 36:55.685
Did she kiss me on the forehead
when she tucked me in at night?

36:58.423 --> 36:59.722
Hey.

36:59.758 --> 37:02.659
Whatever kind of mother she was...

37:02.694 --> 37:06.496
she was amazing...

37:06.531 --> 37:08.598
because so are you.

37:14.606 --> 37:17.807
I just wish that I could talk to her...

37:17.842 --> 37:20.710
and get her advice about all of this.

37:35.827 --> 37:38.561
Looks like the muse has struck.

37:38.596 --> 37:40.830
It looks like it has.

37:42.467 --> 37:44.634
Oh, sorry. It's my brother.

37:47.539 --> 37:49.405
- Hey, Ev.
<i>- Hey, Jane. What's up?</i>

37:49.441 --> 37:50.673
<i>I saw you called.</i>

37:50.709 --> 37:52.709
Yeah, thanks for calling me back.

37:52.744 --> 37:54.577
<i>- Everything okay?</i>
- No, I'm fine.

37:54.612 --> 37:56.813
I just...

37:56.848 --> 38:00.383
- I wanted to ask you about mom.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

38:00.418 --> 38:03.419
Just kind of having trouble remembering.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.421
<i>Like what?</i>

38:05.457 --> 38:07.657
Yeah, like, I mean,

38:07.692 --> 38:10.660
what were bedtimes like?

38:10.695 --> 38:15.598
<i>Well, she used to sing us
that Fleetwood Mac song, "Landslide."</i>

38:15.633 --> 38:17.600
- She did?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

38:18.503 --> 38:20.770
No wonder I love that song.

38:22.373 --> 38:23.573
You wanted to see me?

38:23.608 --> 38:25.641
I wanted to talk to you about Whole Spa.

38:25.677 --> 38:27.577
I should have come to you first.

38:27.612 --> 38:29.345
Cleo should have known better.

38:29.380 --> 38:30.813
I mean, I should have too.

38:30.849 --> 38:35.585
I think I was just so flattered
that they wanted me, I...

38:35.620 --> 38:37.754
I just said yes without thinking, but...

38:37.789 --> 38:40.556
- won't do it again.
- Well, let's not overcorrect.

38:40.592 --> 38:43.760
I mean, you are inspiring.
Your story is powerful,

38:43.795 --> 38:45.762
but don't just let
anybody tell your story.

38:45.797 --> 38:48.531
Find companies and causes
that you feel proud to get behind.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.767
Do you really think I should
try something like that again?

38:50.802 --> 38:53.369
I'd be disappointed if you didn't.

39:05.383 --> 39:11.454
_

39:42.754 --> 39:44.453
Hi, I'm here to pick up

39:44.489 --> 39:45.788
the travel memo for
the fashion department.

39:45.824 --> 39:47.557
And before you ask, yes,

39:47.592 --> 39:49.392
Oliver is booked first class,
aisle seat.

39:49.427 --> 39:50.626
Okay, great.
And Frank's in here too, right?

39:50.662 --> 39:52.762
Of course, and his meal is vegetarian.

39:52.797 --> 39:55.698
And I am holding a middle seat,
back row for you.

39:55.733 --> 39:57.600
Sorry?

39:57.635 --> 39:59.106
It was the only seat left.

39:59.170 --> 40:02.438
Oliver just called this morning.
So it was the best I could do.

40:02.473 --> 40:04.874
But, hey, you're going to Paris, right?

40:06.411 --> 40:07.677
I'm going...

40:07.712 --> 40:09.512
I'm going to Paris for Fashion Week?

40:09.547 --> 40:10.813
Oh, my God.

40:10.849 --> 40:13.382
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

40:14.552 --> 40:16.485
I'm gonna throw up.
I'm not gonna throw up.

40:16.521 --> 40:17.720
Don't throw up.

40:17.755 --> 40:19.655
- I might throw up.
- Don't throw up.

40:19.691 --> 40:22.525
<i>And then she'd read us a bedtime story.</i>

40:22.560 --> 40:25.728
<i>You always wanted
"Harold and the Purple Crayon."</i>

40:30.468 --> 40:31.500
Yeah.
