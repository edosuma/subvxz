00:00.305 --> 00:02.443
Guys! I have a great
idea for a prank.

00:02.531 --> 00:03.591
Before Holt comes in

00:03.679 --> 00:05.327
I'm gonna put ink on the podium
where he puts his hands.

00:05.414 --> 00:06.483
I don't think
he'll fall for that.

00:06.570 --> 00:07.435
- I did!
- How?

00:07.523 --> 00:08.531
I haven't even
opened this yet.

00:08.618 --> 00:09.406
I guess it's unrelated.

00:09.494 --> 00:11.257
Captain Holt hates pranks.
This is gonna backfire, man.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.381
Ugh, fine, I'll tone it down.
I'll...

00:13.632 --> 00:15.162
move his podium
a foot to the left.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.685
What?
He'll be so angry.

00:16.773 --> 00:17.928
- Okay, five inches.
- Five?

00:18.016 --> 00:18.909
- Three?
- Three?

00:18.997 --> 00:19.843
- One?
- One?

00:19.931 --> 00:21.176
All right.
I'll move it a half inch.

00:21.263 --> 00:22.523
Fine.
It's your funeral.

00:22.611 --> 00:23.632
Oh my god.

00:24.388 --> 00:26.162
Worst prank ever.
So stupid.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.812
Holt's not even
going to notice.

00:28.006 --> 00:29.328
Good morning.

00:32.642 --> 00:33.773
You guys...

00:34.180 --> 00:35.890
The podium, it's...

00:36.920 --> 00:38.062
Ha.

00:44.789 --> 00:46.076
You're crazy!

00:46.164 --> 00:47.554
How did you pull this off?

01:07.381 --> 01:10.166
Yes, Kevin, they moved it
a full half inch.

01:10.254 --> 01:11.995
I'll tell you
the entire story tonight.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.303
I love you as well.
Goodbye.

01:14.391 --> 01:16.607
Oh, that was a fun
several moments.

01:16.695 --> 01:18.399
So, there's been
a series of homicides.

01:18.486 --> 01:20.357
Three victims, all young men,

01:20.444 --> 01:22.272
each murdered
in their own fashion.

01:22.359 --> 01:23.534
A serial killer?
How'd they do it?

01:23.621 --> 01:25.493
Strangled? Mangled?
Hung, i.e. dangled?

01:25.580 --> 01:26.581
Their bodies
were disfigured.

01:26.668 --> 01:27.476
I.e. "mangled."
Continue.

01:27.564 --> 01:28.765
Our killer
cut the victims open

01:28.853 --> 01:29.860
and ripped out their hearts.

01:29.947 --> 01:31.296
Now, before
I assign this case...

01:31.384 --> 01:32.281
- Five dollars!
- What?

01:32.369 --> 01:34.023
I'm bidding for it.
I want this so badly.

01:34.111 --> 01:35.241
- That's not how we...
- $20.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.164
Just to make this interesting.

01:36.252 --> 01:38.787
- $100 for Jake to have it!
- I was going to assign

01:38.875 --> 01:40.779
the case to you and Peralta
but perhaps I should

01:40.867 --> 01:42.382
give it to Diaz instead.
$200!

01:42.470 --> 01:43.863
It's not about
the money, Boyle!

01:43.951 --> 01:45.860
Commissioner Kelly
is breathing down my neck.

01:45.948 --> 01:48.385
I need this case handled
professionally and maturely.

01:48.472 --> 01:50.217
Name one time
I haven't acted professionally.

01:50.304 --> 01:51.257
You're holding a juice box.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.984
It stops me
from spilling my juice!

01:53.072 --> 01:54.509
Look, we can handle this, sir.

01:54.609 --> 01:56.647
Do we joke around sometimes?
Yes, but when it's time

01:56.734 --> 01:58.134
to buckle down,
we're seasoned professionals.

01:58.221 --> 01:59.483
That's why they call us
the Spice Boys.

01:59.570 --> 02:00.615
They don't
and they won't.

02:00.702 --> 02:02.791
Sir, I swear,
give us a chance.

02:02.878 --> 02:04.179
We can get this guy.

02:04.879 --> 02:06.750
Fine.
Case goes to the Spice Boys.

02:06.838 --> 02:08.219
- Please don't call us that.
- Too late.

02:08.306 --> 02:09.613
Spice Boy train
has left the station.

02:09.699 --> 02:10.798
Toot toot!

02:10.886 --> 02:12.235
Hey, hey, check it out.

02:12.322 --> 02:13.889
It's my lieutenant
start paperwork!

02:13.976 --> 02:15.499
It's gonna be so weird
not calling you Sarge anymore.

02:15.586 --> 02:17.501
Maybe I'll go by Loot.
"Morning, Loot!"

02:17.588 --> 02:19.503
"Loot over here."
"Let's invite Loot!"

02:19.590 --> 02:20.998
What do you think?

02:22.459 --> 02:23.725
I bet you're
excited about

02:23.812 --> 02:25.226
the raise that comes
with your promotion.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.913
Well, Terry doesn't like
to talk about money, but, uh...

02:28.163 --> 02:29.663
Cha-ching!

02:29.861 --> 02:31.385
Now I can pay for Showtime.

02:31.472 --> 02:32.951
Find out who or what
"SMILF" is!

02:33.038 --> 02:34.562
You know, some people say,
"Mo money, mo problems,"

02:34.649 --> 02:36.259
but those people are idiots.
Money's amazing.

02:36.346 --> 02:37.652
Wait, what?

02:37.739 --> 02:39.215
This says there's
not enough money

02:39.303 --> 02:40.881
in the Nine-Nine's budget
for my raise!

02:40.969 --> 02:41.733
What does that mean?

02:41.821 --> 02:43.428
They're going to
transfer me!

02:45.909 --> 02:47.781
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

02:47.923 --> 02:49.968
Where'd dem guts go?

02:50.055 --> 02:50.910
Uh, yeah.

02:50.998 --> 02:51.983
This guy needs a dentist,

02:52.071 --> 02:53.768
because he's got
a big ol' cavity.

02:53.856 --> 02:55.538
I love that.
I'm stealing it.

02:55.626 --> 02:57.084
You cannot steal
what is a gift.

02:57.172 --> 02:59.673
Thank you.
Okay, so whoever did this,

02:59.761 --> 03:01.498
they weren't careful
with the organs.

03:01.586 --> 03:04.168
They just sorta grabbed
whatever and yanked.

03:04.256 --> 03:06.164
Title of your sex tape.
Oh, that's just something

03:06.251 --> 03:07.289
we say back at the Nine-Nine.

03:07.376 --> 03:09.327
Interesting, 'cause around
here sex tape is what

03:09.423 --> 03:12.496
we call the adhesive you use
to reattach a severed penis.

03:12.584 --> 03:14.210
Oh, I'll have to
pick some of that up.

03:14.297 --> 03:15.819
- Why?
- Anyway...

03:15.907 --> 03:19.207
most of the killer's incisions
are very sloppy but then once

03:19.295 --> 03:21.340
he gets to the heart
they become very careful.

03:21.428 --> 03:24.046
I mean, look at the vena cava.
That's a clean cut.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.395
Game recognize game.

03:25.482 --> 03:27.354
Hmm. I like your style,
Doctor Cox.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.319
Gentlemen!
The Commissioner would like

03:29.443 --> 03:30.618
a status update on the case.

03:30.705 --> 03:31.906
Oh, come on Ray.
You make it sound like

03:31.993 --> 03:34.200
- I'm puttin' the screws to ya.
- No, I just popped in

03:34.288 --> 03:36.005
to say if you don't
solve these murders immediately

03:36.092 --> 03:38.428
there's gonna be some
serious consequences.

03:40.561 --> 03:42.170
I'm just messin' with ya!

03:42.258 --> 03:44.289
Listen, you know what would
help you catch this guy?

03:44.376 --> 03:46.422
I just launched a new app,
HotClues.

03:46.548 --> 03:47.311
Are you familiar with it?

03:47.399 --> 03:48.791
The one that
allows civilians

03:48.879 --> 03:51.342
to submit anonymous tips
directly to the NYPD?

03:51.430 --> 03:53.693
Yes, I'm familiar with...
HotClues.

03:53.781 --> 03:55.272
Great!
You know, it's actually

03:55.360 --> 03:58.012
helped us solve 17 cases,
so I think we should ask

03:58.100 --> 03:59.429
for the public's help
with this one.

03:59.516 --> 04:01.856
No, study after study has
shown that soliciting

04:01.944 --> 04:04.832
anonymous tips results in false
leads and wrongful convictions.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.088
Hmm.
Tell me how you really feel.

04:06.175 --> 04:08.569
- I did.
- And I loved it! Such passion!

04:08.656 --> 04:10.130
But I think HotClues
could help us here.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.311
No, we will solve
this case the proper way

04:12.398 --> 04:15.402
with actual police work
conducted by the two best

04:15.489 --> 04:17.964
- detectives in the NYPD.
- Captain!

04:18.053 --> 04:20.577
Well, I certainly hope
your methods work.

04:20.817 --> 04:23.045
For the sake
of your careers.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.506
Bye now.

04:25.368 --> 04:28.262
Oof! Now that guy's
gonna need some sex tape.

04:28.350 --> 04:30.241
'Cause someone's
gonna cut his penis off.

04:30.329 --> 04:31.913
We are vibing!

04:32.015 --> 04:34.032
So...
I found out where

04:34.128 --> 04:35.342
they're transferring me.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.814
And, you know, I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.513
Oh! Somewhere nice?
Upper West Side?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.645
No, even better.

04:41.732 --> 04:43.147
Staten Island!

04:44.577 --> 04:45.736
Good one, Loot.

04:45.823 --> 04:47.956
- Where you really going?
- No, I'm serious. Staten!

04:48.043 --> 04:49.421
Wait, they're transferring
you out of New York?

04:49.508 --> 04:50.647
It's part of the City!

04:50.735 --> 04:52.989
- Is it, though?
- Hey, Staten Island is great.

04:53.077 --> 04:55.746
It's got parks,
loads of bike paths,

04:55.834 --> 04:57.686
tons of up and coming
restaurants...

04:57.774 --> 05:00.035
I mean...
easy access to New Jersey!

05:00.123 --> 05:01.723
You're lying.
Your right pec is popping

05:01.811 --> 05:03.973
all over the place.
We all know that's your tell.

05:04.061 --> 05:05.981
Of course I'm lying!
It's Staten Island!

05:06.069 --> 05:07.504
The precinct
is the One-Two-Two.

05:07.592 --> 05:09.630
How the hell am I supposed
to chant One-Two-Two?

05:09.717 --> 05:12.502
One-Two-Two!
One-Two-Two!

05:12.589 --> 05:14.461
I sound like a damn
choo-choo train!

05:14.788 --> 05:16.550
Detectives, how's the case?
Any breakthroughs?

05:16.637 --> 05:18.639
Uh, well, we're still
in the early stages.

05:18.726 --> 05:20.358
Do you have a suspect
or DNA evidence?

05:20.446 --> 05:21.639
Oh my god.
I wish.

05:21.727 --> 05:24.147
Look, we need to solve
this to prove to that idiot

05:24.253 --> 05:27.444
John Kelly, how inane
and useless his little app is.

05:27.532 --> 05:29.215
Oh dip.
I see what's going on.

05:29.303 --> 05:31.311
- Holt is feeling petty.
- I'm not being petty.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.565
I can assure you my feelings

05:32.653 --> 05:34.002
about John Kelly
are purely professional.

05:34.089 --> 05:35.435
Are they?
Because every time his name

05:35.522 --> 05:37.378
is brought up in our group text
thread you immediately send

05:37.465 --> 05:38.832
back a super catty GIF
of some lady

05:38.920 --> 05:40.530
from "The Durrells in Corfu"
rolling her eyes.

05:40.617 --> 05:42.450
That's Louisa Durrell,
exasperated by

05:42.538 --> 05:43.533
the pace of life on Corfu!

05:43.620 --> 05:44.677
Wait, the group
text thread is back?

05:44.764 --> 05:45.483
- No.
- We misspoke.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.718
- Yeah.
- Look, if you can't solve

05:46.805 --> 05:48.468
this case I'll reassign
it to someone who can.

05:48.555 --> 05:50.156
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
I have an idea.

05:50.244 --> 05:52.038
We need to get
into the mind of a sicko.

05:52.171 --> 05:56.569
And the only way to do that is
with the help of another sicko.

06:02.944 --> 06:04.850
Jake!
It's so good to see you!

06:04.938 --> 06:06.983
Come give me a hug,
I'm not going to eat you!

06:07.078 --> 06:10.081
Also, don't hug me
'cause I will try to eat you.

06:10.983 --> 06:12.801
This is such a surprise!

06:12.889 --> 06:14.966
I haven't seen you
since I transferred here.

06:15.054 --> 06:16.316
How's Amy?
She's great!

06:16.403 --> 06:18.187
We're married
and she's a Sergeant now.

06:18.274 --> 06:20.043
- Wow!
- Yeah! How's everything here?

06:20.131 --> 06:21.538
You know, same old same old.

06:21.625 --> 06:24.176
Guess who's here? Herman.
Herman!

06:24.264 --> 06:26.387
Always playing Yahtzee,
knew everybody's name.

06:26.475 --> 06:27.637
- Worshipped Satan.
- Did he?

06:27.725 --> 06:29.053
He never mentioned that.

06:30.342 --> 06:32.717
- He wouldn't shut up about it.
- It is exhausting.

06:32.866 --> 06:35.372
Well, I'm Charles.
I'm Jake's best friend.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.178
Charles, he's serving three
life sentences.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.114
No need to flex.
So Caleb, we're tracking

06:39.202 --> 06:41.202
a serial killer
and I was thinking

06:41.290 --> 06:42.944
you could help us
get inside his head.

06:43.032 --> 06:44.207
Just because I ate humans

06:44.295 --> 06:46.147
doesn't mean that
I'm inhuman, Jake.

06:46.235 --> 06:47.776
Caleb, come on.
That's not what I meant.

06:47.863 --> 06:48.592
I'm just kidding.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.694
I'm probably friends
with the guy online.

06:51.147 --> 06:52.084
What's his deal?

06:52.172 --> 06:54.405
Well, he's been
murdering young men

06:54.493 --> 06:55.973
and cutting out their hearts.

06:56.061 --> 06:57.030
Ew.
What?

06:57.118 --> 06:58.296
I would never eat a heart.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.776
I stick to the normal stuff.

06:59.864 --> 07:00.909
Butts and thighs.

07:01.043 --> 07:03.444
One time I ate a foot,
but it was nasty.

07:03.532 --> 07:04.562
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You know what?

07:04.649 --> 07:07.241
There was some weird guy
on the forum recently.

07:07.435 --> 07:08.872
- The forum?
- Yeah, it's a chat room

07:08.959 --> 07:11.077
for people who like to talk
about eating human beings

07:11.165 --> 07:12.601
but definitely won't act on it.

07:12.835 --> 07:14.576
Wink.
Yeah, it's hosted on...

07:14.664 --> 07:15.694
- Reddit.
- Obviously.

07:15.782 --> 07:17.976
Anyways, he showed up from out
of nowhere asking questions

07:18.063 --> 07:19.569
- bout cutting out hearts.
- Really?

07:19.657 --> 07:20.616
Do you know
anything else about him?

07:20.704 --> 07:21.789
I'd never seen him
on there before

07:21.876 --> 07:24.288
but you could check the logs.
I'll approve you.

07:24.376 --> 07:25.405
- I'm an admin.
- Ah.

07:25.493 --> 07:27.570
Oh, you might want to switch
to incognito mode.

07:27.658 --> 07:31.338
Otherwise your targeted ads will
be pretty cannibal-specific.

07:31.426 --> 07:32.342
Ah, good to know.

07:32.430 --> 07:33.954
Well, it was good
to see you, Caleb.

07:34.042 --> 07:35.303
Send me that info.

07:37.715 --> 07:40.194
Hey Terry, you okay?
You skipped all your lunches.

07:40.321 --> 07:42.267
I'm going through the budget
to see if there's any way

07:42.354 --> 07:43.976
we could save enough money
for me to stay here.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.827
- You find anything yet?
- Yeah, we could

07:45.915 --> 07:49.528
switch to generic printer ink,
cut down on custodial services,

07:49.616 --> 07:51.530
and stop buying
office birthday cakes.

07:51.618 --> 07:53.751
- Over my dead body!
- It's just an idea.

07:53.839 --> 07:56.235
- Well, take it off the table!
- Damn, Scully, fine.

07:56.323 --> 07:57.454
We could stop paying
for an exterminator.

07:57.541 --> 07:58.477
It's pointless.
We all have guns.

07:58.565 --> 07:59.852
Who am I kidding?

07:59.940 --> 08:01.681
We'll never save enough
to keep me at the Nine-Nine.

08:01.768 --> 08:03.422
You're right.
The only way to free up

08:03.510 --> 08:05.164
that money
is if you fire someone.

08:05.311 --> 08:08.097
What? I can't just fire
someone without cause.

08:08.185 --> 08:10.100
Come on.
We all know there's a bunch of

08:10.188 --> 08:11.276
dead weight around here.

08:11.364 --> 08:13.975
Sloppy paperwork,
penmanship fails,

08:14.071 --> 08:16.219
phone etiquette that
makes me want to barf.

08:16.307 --> 08:17.612
Let's axe a dud!

08:17.700 --> 08:19.932
Damn, Amy.
I am loving this shade on you.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.621
But Loot's right.
We can't just fire somebody.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.805
That said, you could
"inspire" somebody to quit.

08:24.893 --> 08:27.070
For example, Broadway Brian.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.436
Yes!
Broadway Brian, of course!

08:29.524 --> 08:31.091
Who the hell
is Broadway Brian?

08:31.179 --> 08:32.414
Brian in records.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.951
He's always talking about
what a great singer he is

08:35.039 --> 08:37.363
and how his dream
is to be in musicals.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.727
You just need to convince him
to go for his dream.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.922
Oh, I don't know.
That feels underhanded.

08:42.010 --> 08:44.030
It's never underhanded to help
somebody follow their dream.

08:44.116 --> 08:45.251
Yesterday,
I was watching "Ellen,"

08:45.338 --> 08:46.759
and she had this woman on
who wanted to be a chef,

08:46.846 --> 08:48.626
but she didn't have any taste
buds, so she quit her job,

08:48.713 --> 08:50.111
hired her best friend
to be her taste tester.

08:50.198 --> 08:51.606
And now they have the best taco
truck in Lansing.

08:51.693 --> 08:53.217
It was inspiration ♪♪♪♪.

08:53.390 --> 08:54.444
Yeah.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.453
I'd just be helping him
follow his dream!

08:56.541 --> 08:58.108
I'd be doing him a favor!

08:58.196 --> 09:01.649
I'm going to inspire Brian's
ass right out of this office!

09:01.737 --> 09:02.999
For him, not me.

09:03.087 --> 09:05.125
Dreams, and whatnot, you know.

09:05.296 --> 09:07.289
Detectives,
Commissioner Kelly is back

09:07.432 --> 09:09.086
and he found his way here
on his own

09:09.174 --> 09:10.500
without any tips
from the public.

09:10.588 --> 09:12.631
- How impressive is that?
- Well, thank you, Raymond.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.982
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

09:14.069 --> 09:15.872
Thought I'd check
on your progress.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.005
Um, we have a solid lead.

09:18.093 --> 09:19.325
Suspicious online behavior

09:19.413 --> 09:21.661
from someone using the name
Jamburger77.

09:21.791 --> 09:23.467
There's only one person
in the tri-state area

09:23.554 --> 09:25.450
with that surname...
Eileen Jamburger.

09:25.544 --> 09:28.547
101 years old, and immediately
racist on the phone.

09:28.635 --> 09:29.912
She is not a suspect
at this time.

09:29.999 --> 09:32.294
But the user did make
one non-cannibal post.

09:32.382 --> 09:35.708
A negative review of the
headroom in a 2006 Saturn lon.

09:35.796 --> 09:37.035
Real creep car.

09:37.123 --> 09:39.434
So, we pulled records
on every 2006 lon in the city

09:39.522 --> 09:40.958
and we're following up
on them now.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.310
Well, I'll be.

09:42.398 --> 09:44.228
That's some nice police work,
Peralta.

09:44.316 --> 09:45.747
- And Charles.
- I especially like how

09:45.834 --> 09:47.473
you found evidence,
followed up on it,

09:47.561 --> 09:49.302
and it's lead you closer
to a solve.

09:49.871 --> 09:51.656
No, I agree, Peralta.
It's excellent work.

09:51.743 --> 09:53.266
You must've hated
saying that.

09:53.353 --> 09:54.971
No, I didn't.
I like giving compliments.

09:55.059 --> 09:57.841
You have a nice deep voice.
It is very commanding.

09:57.929 --> 10:00.671
Cut the crap, John.
You're furious!

10:00.759 --> 10:02.416
And everyone can tell!

10:03.034 --> 10:05.538
See?
Very commanding.

10:05.626 --> 10:08.549
So, I know Raymond has
some issues with HotClues,

10:08.637 --> 10:10.509
but we did put
the call out on the app

10:10.597 --> 10:12.729
and got a very promising tip.

10:12.817 --> 10:14.645
Look, we're not going
against our Captain.

10:14.733 --> 10:18.389
So this guy says
he saw someone covered in blood

10:18.477 --> 10:20.131
getting out of a Saturn lon.

10:20.219 --> 10:21.742
But you don't need that tip

10:21.830 --> 10:25.667
because you are among the
best detectives in the NYPD!

10:27.034 --> 10:29.221
You're right,
we don't need that tip!

10:30.546 --> 10:32.018
But seriously,
send us that tip.

10:32.075 --> 10:33.250
We need it.

10:33.346 --> 10:35.011
Hey, Brian!
What are you up to?

10:35.099 --> 10:36.840
Typing in numbers
into a computer.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.567
Like I always do endlessly
for 40-60 hours a week.

10:39.655 --> 10:40.691
Well, when you love
what you do,

10:40.778 --> 10:42.362
you don't work
a day in your life!

10:42.450 --> 10:45.120
Unless, do you not love
sad data entry?

10:45.208 --> 10:46.906
Well,
my passion is performing.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.120
I do musical theater.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.971
- It's the hardest form of acting.
- I agree!

10:50.058 --> 10:52.408
I am always saying,
if you're not singing,

10:52.519 --> 10:54.190
- you're not acting.
- Right!

10:54.298 --> 10:55.776
It's probably hard
to audition

10:55.890 --> 10:57.500
because you're always here,
right?

10:57.612 --> 11:00.741
Yes! I had to pass up a chance
to read for "Seussical."

11:00.829 --> 11:02.468
You know Brian,
this makes me think

11:02.556 --> 11:03.818
of something I saw on "Ellen."

11:03.906 --> 11:06.474
There was this lady,
she wanted to be a cook,

11:06.929 --> 11:08.405
but her tongue
was all messed up,

11:08.493 --> 11:11.429
and she had this friend
who didn't even have a tongue...

11:11.550 --> 11:12.788
I mean, she did,

11:12.928 --> 11:16.686
and now they own a taco truck
in Lansing!

11:16.789 --> 11:17.780
Huh?

11:17.868 --> 11:19.174
Follow your dreams, man!

11:19.262 --> 11:20.654
You gotta follow your dreams.

11:20.742 --> 11:22.624
Find your taco truck!

11:23.062 --> 11:25.452
Wow.
Thank you.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.368
That gives me
a lot to think about.

11:27.540 --> 11:28.900
So what did you
come down here for?

11:29.014 --> 11:33.454
Oh, uh, I had to borrow...

11:33.542 --> 11:34.804
the water cooler!

11:34.892 --> 11:36.763
All right.
Thanks, Brian.

11:36.918 --> 11:38.529
Think about what I said.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.446
So, the tipster saw
the Saturn parked out back

11:41.534 --> 11:42.639
and the woman at the desk said

11:42.726 --> 11:44.336
it belongs to the man
in room 203.

11:44.424 --> 11:46.708
One "Larry Bird."
Obvious fake name.

11:46.796 --> 11:49.073
Or is it so insane that
there's no way it's fake?

11:49.161 --> 11:50.225
If you're trying not
to draw attention,

11:50.312 --> 11:51.866
why not go with something
like "John Smith?"

11:51.953 --> 11:53.040
From "Pocahontas"?

11:53.128 --> 11:55.440
Uh, yeah.
Way to fly under the radar.

11:55.929 --> 11:57.854
Excuse me, is there ice yet?

11:57.942 --> 11:59.580
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't work here.

11:59.668 --> 12:00.426
I'm a police officer.

12:00.514 --> 12:02.394
Well, then I'd like
to lodge a formal complaint.

12:02.481 --> 12:03.917
There hasn't been ice here
for days

12:04.005 --> 12:05.834
and everyone knows
my wine coolers are supposed

12:05.921 --> 12:07.324
- to be served chilled.
- You're an adult.

12:07.411 --> 12:08.692
Why are you
drinking wine coolers?

12:08.779 --> 12:10.346
- Because I'm on vacation.
- Okay.

12:10.434 --> 12:12.484
Well, I'll mention the ice.

12:12.572 --> 12:13.941
Thanks.
Pig.

12:14.029 --> 12:15.466
Okay.

12:17.932 --> 12:19.090
Oh, it's Holt.

12:19.178 --> 12:20.292
I didn't tell him
what we were doing.

12:20.379 --> 12:21.442
- I'll act natural.
- You're not gonna be

12:21.529 --> 12:22.467
on the phone call.
Just do nothing.

12:22.555 --> 12:23.521
Hey he-e-y, Captain!

12:23.609 --> 12:25.529
What delicious water
I'm drinking!

12:25.642 --> 12:27.341
Sorry that we didn't
check in before we left.

12:27.428 --> 12:28.908
We're just down
at the DMV following up

12:28.995 --> 12:30.566
- on the Saturn owners.
- Lies!

12:30.654 --> 12:32.185
Captain!
How'd you know we were here?

12:32.273 --> 12:33.232
I followed you!

12:33.320 --> 12:35.185
John Kelly gave you
a "Hot Clue," didn't he?

12:35.273 --> 12:36.579
How dare you disobey me.

12:36.667 --> 12:37.972
Come on, sir,
it was a good tip

12:38.047 --> 12:39.311
and we're trying
to catch a serial killer.

12:39.398 --> 12:40.756
Well then let's see
this tip,

12:40.844 --> 12:42.933
this groundbreaking tip

12:43.021 --> 12:44.458
that threatens
to blow the case wide open.

12:44.545 --> 12:46.765
Okay, I know this tone.
Here comes petty Holt.

12:46.969 --> 12:48.080
Naw, bitch.
I'm not being petty.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.467
You just said, "naw, bitch."

12:49.555 --> 12:51.178
Show me the tip.

12:51.266 --> 12:52.876
Title of your sex tape.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.693
I was behind
the Royal Motor Inn.

12:54.781 --> 12:57.342
I saw a guy get out
of a blue Saturn lon

12:57.430 --> 12:58.692
and he was covered in blood.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.203
Anyway, Baba Booey!

13:00.291 --> 13:02.115
Baba Booey?
Is that a clue?

13:02.203 --> 13:04.478
Uh, I don't know what
Baba Booey means, actually.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.967
It's a popular prank phrase
from Howard Stern.

13:07.112 --> 13:09.331
- Charles!
- Oh, from a shock jock.

13:09.418 --> 13:10.585
Well, that changes everything.

13:10.672 --> 13:13.248
Now we have
a credible break in the case.

13:13.336 --> 13:14.598
Baba Booey!

13:15.209 --> 13:16.818
NYPD, open up!

13:16.906 --> 13:17.834
Uh, just a minute!

13:17.922 --> 13:20.141
Ooh, I bet
he's frantically packing up

13:20.229 --> 13:21.755
his collection of hearts.

13:22.929 --> 13:24.551
Goin' in!
Get back.

13:26.351 --> 13:28.114
- There's blood everywhere!
- He went out the window.

13:28.201 --> 13:29.965
I'll go around back.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.824
Fine, Kelly found the
murderer's kill room.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.870
Whoop-dee-doo!
Should we throw him a parade?

13:34.958 --> 13:36.917
Yeah!
Maybe!

13:38.567 --> 13:40.324
Patrols have searched
a five-block radius.

13:40.412 --> 13:41.222
No sign of the perp.

13:41.310 --> 13:43.135
And there were no prints.
He was wearing gloves.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.591
Like the inimitable
Audrey Hepburn.

13:44.679 --> 13:45.747
- Nope.
- Gentlemen, there's something

13:45.834 --> 13:47.317
I need to say.
I gave you such a hard time

13:47.404 --> 13:51.035
about using Commissioner Kelly's
app because I was being petty.

13:51.143 --> 13:53.275
I wanted him to fail
and I took it out on you

13:53.440 --> 13:56.582
and for that I am very...

13:58.398 --> 13:59.978
Oh. You kind of trailed off
there, sir.

14:00.066 --> 14:01.450
Were you going
to finish your sentence?

14:01.537 --> 14:02.843
It felt like you were going
to say you were sorry.

14:02.930 --> 14:03.910
I did.
Boyle heard it.

14:03.998 --> 14:06.018
Uh, I would remember if
someone said my catch phrase.

14:06.105 --> 14:07.992
Fine, I'm sorry.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.320
I'm very sorry.

14:10.423 --> 14:12.008
Apology accepted.

14:12.104 --> 14:14.559
- I am so proud of you.
- Peralta.

14:14.647 --> 14:15.712
You're right.
I'll rub it in later.

14:15.799 --> 14:17.149
What matters now
is solving this case.

14:17.236 --> 14:18.896
Now, our murderer
may have gotten away,

14:18.984 --> 14:20.783
but we did find
his kill room.

14:20.870 --> 14:22.235
Maybe there's something in here
that we're not seeing, yet.

14:22.322 --> 14:24.272
Perhaps we should pay your
cannibal friend another visit.

14:24.359 --> 14:26.937
I wouldn't say they're friends
so much as ex-cellmates.

14:27.025 --> 14:28.797
No, it's true.
We're friends.

14:28.885 --> 14:31.469
- He ate kids!
- Well, people are complicated.

14:31.635 --> 14:32.795
Now, I'll tell you one thing.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.539
You are not looking
for a cannibal.

14:34.627 --> 14:36.126
- Why do you say that?
- With all that blood?

14:36.213 --> 14:39.203
No self-respecting cannibal
would waste all that sauce.

14:39.291 --> 14:40.684
See, Charles?
He's a foodie, like you.

14:40.771 --> 14:42.859
- Who are you?
- Can I see that picture again?

14:43.054 --> 14:45.109
Oh man, those are
some nice tools.

14:45.197 --> 14:46.764
I would love
to spread some ribs

14:46.852 --> 14:48.158
using that sternum retractor,

14:48.246 --> 14:49.465
but they only sell those
to hospitals.

14:49.552 --> 14:51.250
Wait a minute.
What did you just say?

14:51.338 --> 14:53.219
I said I'd love
to get my little fingies

14:53.307 --> 14:54.453
in some chesties.

14:54.541 --> 14:56.226
No, no, no.
Not the super gross part.

14:56.314 --> 14:57.336
Surgery-grade tools,

14:57.424 --> 14:58.602
precise incisions
around the heart,

14:58.689 --> 15:00.125
and there was no ice
at the motel.

15:00.213 --> 15:02.302
Because the perp was using
it for the hearts.

15:02.390 --> 15:04.044
We're not looking
for a serial killer.

15:04.131 --> 15:05.959
He stole the hearts
for a transplant!

15:06.047 --> 15:07.352
Boom!
We solved it.

15:07.525 --> 15:09.788
- Boyle, give me a hug.
- Yeah!

15:09.976 --> 15:12.155
No!

15:12.717 --> 15:13.928
Hey, I did it!

15:14.016 --> 15:16.529
I talked to Brian and encouraged
him to pursue his dreams.

15:16.617 --> 15:17.904
Really?
Is he gonna quit?

15:17.992 --> 15:19.472
I don't know,
that was the first step.

15:19.599 --> 15:21.384
But I figure
if I talk to him twice a day

15:21.472 --> 15:23.388
- for the next few weeks...
- Attention, everyone!

15:23.475 --> 15:25.693
Today will be my final day
at the Nine-Nine.

15:25.781 --> 15:27.076
Damn, Loot.
That was fast.

15:27.164 --> 15:28.740
I will be taking my talents
to Broadway

15:28.828 --> 15:30.936
and I owe it all
to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords.

15:31.027 --> 15:32.334
All I did was
believe in you.

15:32.422 --> 15:33.641
And it changed everything.

15:33.729 --> 15:35.951
So Lieutenant,
this one's for you.

16:01.477 --> 16:04.567
Angelo Rinaldi, who runs
the Rinaldi crime family.

16:04.807 --> 16:07.418
Well.
Then let's pay him a visit.

16:08.311 --> 16:11.097
- NYPD!
- Hands where we can see them!

16:11.241 --> 16:12.356
There's a heart
in the cooler.

16:12.443 --> 16:15.074
Sorry, Rinaldi, the only
transplant happening today

16:15.162 --> 16:16.598
is your ass to jail.

16:16.654 --> 16:18.222
He is definitely unconscious
and didn't hear any of that.

16:18.309 --> 16:20.199
But I'm still pumped.
Case closed. Let's go!

16:20.287 --> 16:22.637
So Rinaldi had his
trigger-man stealing hearts

16:22.725 --> 16:24.956
so he could have a transplant.

16:25.044 --> 16:27.090
That is fun!
Good job, Ray.

16:27.178 --> 16:28.325
Thank you,
Commissioner Kelly.

16:28.412 --> 16:30.089
We couldn't have done it

16:31.826 --> 16:33.988
Sir, you're doing
the trailing off thing again.

16:34.331 --> 16:37.571
Help.
Um... and I owe you an apology.

16:37.659 --> 16:39.966
I'm sorry and I must admit,

16:40.053 --> 16:42.425
you've really got something
on your hands with this...

16:42.665 --> 16:43.995
HotClues app.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.976
Well, that is
so nice of you to say.

16:46.064 --> 16:47.745
But, if you like the app now,

16:47.833 --> 16:50.714
wait until you see
the updates we're rolling out.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.542

Actually Micah, you wanna
leave that door unlocked

Yeah, that makes sense.
Thanks, bud.

17:29.953 --> 17:30.996
What's going on, Kelly?

17:31.098 --> 17:34.199
Why is your assistant
submitting tips?

17:34.589 --> 17:36.621
Because they already
had the information.

17:36.864 --> 17:38.557
The tips aren't coming
from the public at all.

17:38.644 --> 17:39.496
Oh, cool theory.

17:39.584 --> 17:40.833
But if I already had
the information,

17:40.920 --> 17:43.644
why am I pouring so much money
into developing this app?

17:43.732 --> 17:44.808
To hide
where you're getting it.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.599
Because you're using
illegal wiretaps or something!

17:47.819 --> 17:50.343
You got me!
You guys are good!

17:50.431 --> 17:52.816
I just love how you ping pong
off each other.

17:52.934 --> 17:55.262
This is blatantly
unconstitutional.

17:55.402 --> 17:57.181
- I'm going to the press!
- Yes, you should.

17:57.269 --> 17:59.843
But first, do you know
what a stingray is?

17:59.930 --> 18:01.166
Of course we know
what a Stingray is.

18:01.253 --> 18:02.364
Tenderest meat in the ocean!

18:02.451 --> 18:04.323
No, stingray is
a portable cell tower.

18:04.434 --> 18:05.666
You drive it around the city.

18:05.754 --> 18:08.384
It captures data from any
cell phone within reach.

18:08.472 --> 18:12.456
Like, oh, text messages,
location history, voicemail...

18:12.552 --> 18:13.613
Oh my god.

18:13.715 --> 18:15.230
You have a
"Dark Knight" machine!

18:15.318 --> 18:17.090
Yes, I do,
and the three of you

18:17.209 --> 18:18.668
are not going
to say a word about it

18:18.756 --> 18:20.412
because the 18 felons

18:20.500 --> 18:22.836
we captured through the system,
they'd go free.

18:22.924 --> 18:24.316
That's unfortunate,
but it's better

18:24.404 --> 18:25.724
than living
in a police state.

18:25.841 --> 18:27.286
- I'm not sitting on this.
- Okay.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.880
But I can assure you, you can't
prove this program exists.

18:29.974 --> 18:31.155
It's just your word
against mine.

18:31.242 --> 18:32.850
- I'm more than fine with that.
- You shouldn't be.

18:32.937 --> 18:36.362
Because I can prove you'd do
anything to sabotage me.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.052
My stingray
captured your texts, too.

18:39.140 --> 18:41.403
No, he has
the "Durrells in Corfu" GIF!

18:41.491 --> 18:42.950
Oh-ho-ho.
Way worse.

18:43.115 --> 18:44.388
You wrote several people,

18:44.476 --> 18:47.966
"I would do anything
to rid the NYPD of John Kelly.

18:48.054 --> 18:49.427
"Sincerely, Raymond Holt."

18:49.515 --> 18:52.450

18:56.812 --> 18:58.092
He'll never get cast
in anything.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.790
Maybe he'll be one
of those people on "The Voice"

18:59.877 --> 19:01.917
that's so bad they become
an Internet sensation.

19:02.005 --> 19:03.690
That's not what they do
on "The Voice", Amy,

19:03.777 --> 19:04.802
that's "American Idol"!

19:04.890 --> 19:06.690
"The Voice" is purely

If he wants to pursue his
dream and it doesn't work out,

19:08.667 --> 19:10.887
that's not on you.
He made his choice.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.396
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You know, no blood on my hands.

19:13.484 --> 19:14.795
I just need to let him
do his thing.

19:14.882 --> 19:17.489
