01:27.400 --> 01:31.696
I expect to see that on your income tax Marty.
I can't hear you people!

01:32.280 --> 01:33.990
You maggots sound like suburbanites.

01:34.281 --> 01:37.785
Fifty bucks for a lousy coin set,
you sell one at a time?

01:38.286 --> 01:41.580
And a hundred bucks for the next
sucker who makes a triple sale.

01:45.876 --> 01:50.297
A minute 50 seconds Bernie.
D'you expect these leads to grow on fucking trees?

01:51.506 --> 01:53.674
Want me over your shoulder all day Bernie, huh?

01:54.592 --> 01:57.595
Ask for the sale four times every time, got it?

02:28.207 --> 02:30.376
You got twenty seconds to close it, Bernie.

02:30.710 --> 02:33.588
Fifteen...
I'm on your tail, Bernie.

02:33.879 --> 02:36.381
Five... Four...
... at a price that would be stupid to pass up.

02:38.008 --> 02:39.885
You'd have to be brain dead. Yeah. How many sets do you want?

02:47.892 --> 02:49.602
- You got the shit, man?
- Yep.

02:50.185 --> 02:51.980
Hey, well give it up, bro.

02:56.609 --> 02:59.404
As ordered.
Pharmaceutical cocaine.

02:59.778 --> 03:03.198
Come on you eunuchs!
Zeke's closing his suckers six, seven times,

03:03.573 --> 03:06.993
and he's got twice as many sales as the rest of you bastards.

03:07.577 --> 03:10.205
You'll spend your Sunday here too
if you don't take these bills from me.

03:23.384 --> 03:24.802
Oh, shit.

03:26.595 --> 03:28.388
Of course, of course.

03:28.889 --> 03:32.601
What a stupid mistake.
Go ahead!

03:38.690 --> 03:43.694
Ah, we have a winner. Jerry...
Who'd have thought? What'll it be, Jer?

03:44.070 --> 03:48.866
Hundred bucks, or a thousand dollars
worth of rare commemorative coins? Hmm?

03:50.784 --> 03:52.494
You think I'm from Jersey?

03:53.078 --> 03:54.204
Wise man.

03:54.497 --> 03:56.790
Ah, christ; a charmed life.

04:01.587 --> 04:04.506
Go on! Go on!

04:51.883 --> 04:52.467
Clay?

05:01.475 --> 05:06.689
Bridget, it's me. They moved it back.
I'll be home when I can.

05:27.001 --> 05:31.962
People saw flames shooting from the building, called the fire department.
By the time the engine got here it was too late,

05:32.671 --> 05:35.592
and there were five dead young people.

05:53.483 --> 05:54.276
How'd it go?

05:55.568 --> 05:56.694
Did you get the money?

05:57.779 --> 05:58.487
Did you?

06:09.289 --> 06:10.583
You walk the streets like that?

06:15.670 --> 06:16.297
You're an idiot.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.473
Bridget, I didn't mean that.

06:31.561 --> 06:36.065
Hey, I'm still hung up honey.
These are very scary people.

06:38.984 --> 06:40.193
Forgive me. Hmm?

06:41.778 --> 06:43.280
I'll make it up to you.

06:45.073 --> 06:48.785
You can hit me. Anywhere. Hard.

06:51.370 --> 06:55.458
Oh, baby, baby, baby - let's not fight, right?

06:55.875 --> 07:00.463
This is our penthouse.
This is the key to the real city.

07:00.963 --> 07:05.675
This is what you wanted.
This is what we've been working for.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.977
Seven hundred thousand.

07:16.268 --> 07:17.979
This was a mistake.

07:18.270 --> 07:21.482
This is just to take care of us during our residency

07:21.774 --> 07:24.986
until the Doctor bucks start rolling in, right?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.779
They're soft.
I thought they'd be stiff.

07:28.572 --> 07:33.368
These are laundered! Untraceable.
Perfectly safe, right?

07:39.290 --> 07:40.875
We have to put them somewhere.

07:45.379 --> 07:47.756
You are a criminal mastermind!

07:48.173 --> 07:49.467
It's just a hobby.

07:50.468 --> 07:53.387
I wanna pay off that loan shark first thing
tomorrow morning.

07:53.679 --> 07:55.263
Oh, maybe he'll forget.

07:55.682 --> 07:58.391
A hundred grand plus interest?
I doubt it.

07:58.684 --> 07:59.767
Stop.

08:00.060 --> 08:03.189
You gotta give a little love.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.861
Somethin' wrong?

08:11.654 --> 08:12.571
Fear.

08:14.366 --> 08:18.160
I'm gonna take a long hot one and then
you and I are gonna celebrate.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.461
Worth the risk, huh?

08:29.254 --> 08:31.381
What do you wanna do tonight?

08:32.173 --> 08:36.469
Go to the opera,
or some kinda big Broadway show?

08:38.179 --> 08:40.765
Fine dining experience?

08:42.850 --> 08:43.976
Whatever you want.

09:26.182 --> 09:28.559
Hey Bridge, do we have any shampoo?

09:41.864 --> 09:44.158
How are we supposed to celebrate?

09:57.545 --> 09:59.171
Hey, Bridge?

10:19.358 --> 10:20.066
Bridget!

10:29.241 --> 10:31.077
You better run!

12:02.954 --> 12:04.540
Where the fuck am I?

12:05.373 --> 12:06.041
Beston.

12:07.667 --> 12:08.960
How far is Chicago?

12:09.752 --> 12:13.173
Oh, ten, twelve hours.
Depends on how fast you drive.

12:27.769 --> 12:29.063
What's that bar like?

13:03.762 --> 13:05.263
Hey, thanks a lot Mike.

13:06.264 --> 13:09.350
- What, did Clarence make you beg?
- I made him beg.

13:10.767 --> 13:12.354
So why all the attitude?

13:12.645 --> 13:14.355
I guess Mike didn't want his job back.

13:14.647 --> 13:18.734
I just didn't want to come back to this dead end town, that's all.

13:19.151 --> 13:21.362
So you, you wanna talk about it or...?

13:22.363 --> 13:26.241
There's nothing to talk about.
I went to Buffalo, it didn't work out. I'm back.

13:26.742 --> 13:28.660
We already know all that.

13:28.951 --> 13:32.539
- I guess he didn't want to talk about it.
- I guess not.

13:33.748 --> 13:34.749
Hi guys.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.252
Hi, Mike.

13:39.754 --> 13:42.047
Hi Stacy. How are you?

13:42.464 --> 13:43.842
- Good, you?
- Good.

13:44.133 --> 13:46.051
Hi Stacy. How are you?

13:52.265 --> 13:52.849
Grow up!

13:54.434 --> 13:56.353
What? Did you leave your dick in Buffalo?

13:56.561 --> 13:58.230
Chris, these women are anchors.

13:58.730 --> 13:59.230
They're what?

14:00.065 --> 14:03.443
They're planted here. You get too close to one,
Beston's got you for life.

14:03.734 --> 14:06.028
Yeah, yeah. Here he goes again.

14:06.653 --> 14:08.448
How many guys in this bar have felt her up?

14:10.241 --> 14:10.949
All of 'em.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.035
And how many have gone home with her - how many have slept with her?

14:17.039 --> 14:18.248
None, including yourself.

14:18.749 --> 14:20.166
Right. I rest my case.

14:20.668 --> 14:22.544
Don't rest it too long 'cos I promise you it'll fall off.

14:26.965 --> 14:28.966
How do I look, do I look alright?
Do you like this?

14:29.467 --> 14:30.135
You look great.

14:35.431 --> 14:36.849
Hey, Stacy.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.850
- Hey, Chris.
- How you doin'?

14:42.146 --> 14:45.566
- So, er, tell me about the wife.
- What?

14:47.025 --> 14:49.152
The wife, man.
Copper wedding band.

14:49.444 --> 14:52.864
- Was it a kind of spur-of-the-moment decision or what?
- I can't get this off.

14:57.034 --> 15:00.246
Use a little octane man, take care of it.

15:02.748 --> 15:06.460
- I just never took you as the impulsive type.
- Neither did I.

15:08.837 --> 15:09.546
Did you divorce her?

15:11.465 --> 15:12.924
I'll get around to it.

15:17.137 --> 15:20.139
I cannot spend the rest of my life here.

15:20.556 --> 15:22.433
I know what's gonna happen each and every day.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.353
So when do you leave?

15:28.230 --> 15:30.649
How long does it take to grow a new set of balls?

15:40.533 --> 15:41.660
Gimme a Manhattan.

15:59.843 --> 16:01.762
I know you hear me, pal.

16:03.721 --> 16:07.559
Anybody need anything down here?
Everybody good?

16:10.520 --> 16:12.439
Jesus Christ. Who's a girl gotta suck around here to get a drink?

16:17.359 --> 16:19.529
City trash, right? You don't take that?

16:20.446 --> 16:21.822
What do you see in her?

16:23.657 --> 16:25.659
Maybe a new set of balls.

16:26.952 --> 16:30.747
- Gimme a Manhattan!
- Ray, a Manhattan for the lady please.

16:34.250 --> 16:35.043
Sure, Mike.

16:39.047 --> 16:41.257
What - that's the game? I gotta say please?

16:41.549 --> 16:46.053
Er, yes, it helps.
You're not from around here?

16:47.722 --> 16:48.723
Fuck off.

16:55.145 --> 16:57.523
- Two dollars, please.
- I got it Ray.

17:02.444 --> 17:03.028
Thanks, Mike.

17:08.031 --> 17:09.826
I er, I took care of that for you.

17:12.619 --> 17:15.123
"Thankyou" can also be very effective.

17:15.540 --> 17:16.749
Could you leave?

17:17.916 --> 17:18.834
Please.

17:19.626 --> 17:21.753
Well I haven't finished charming you yet.

17:22.045 --> 17:24.339
- You haven't started.
- Give me a chance.

17:25.549 --> 17:30.721
Go find yourself a nice little cow-girl, make nice little cow-babies and leave me alone.

17:34.849 --> 17:38.436
I'm er, I'm hung like a horse.
Think about it.

17:43.649 --> 17:44.733
Let's see.

17:45.527 --> 17:48.320
- Excuse me?
- Mister Ed, let's see.

17:49.154 --> 17:51.448
- Look, I tried to be nice.
I can see that something in...

17:54.243 --> 17:56.744
I can be very nice when I try.

17:57.245 --> 17:58.330
Sit down.

18:02.041 --> 18:05.753
Maybe we just got off to a bad start.
I know Ray's put plenty of people in...

18:07.547 --> 18:08.631
What are you... What are you doing?

18:08.923 --> 18:12.051
I believe what we're looking for has a certain horse-like quality.

18:14.220 --> 18:17.515
- Are you serious?
- Never buy anything sight-unseen.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.641
Uh-huh. That's a good policy.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.646
How many lovers?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.232
- What? Do I get extra credit points for experience?
- How many lovers?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.112
Thirteen... Tw-tw-Twelve.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.113
- Any prostitutes?
- No.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.825
- Any men?
- No. No men.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.333
- Am I approved?
- Medically.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.919
- You have your own place?
- Yes.

18:50.336 --> 18:51.713
- Is it a sty?
- No, it's clean.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.047
Do you have indoor plumbing?

18:53.338 --> 18:56.843
Yes, I have indoor plumbing, I have electricity and I have a name.

18:57.134 --> 18:59.137
No names.
Meet me outside.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.711
Frank Griffith please.

19:40.259 --> 19:40.842
Hi.

19:42.343 --> 19:43.845
It's a local call.

19:50.998 --> 19:51.728
It's personal.

20:06.116 --> 20:07.262
Bridget.

20:08.034 --> 20:11.204
- Always a pleasure.
- You still a lawyer Frank?

20:11.329 --> 20:13.665
Yeah, you still a self-serving bitch?

20:15.542 --> 20:17.793
A friend needs advice.
I'll set it up for you:

20:17.919 --> 20:21.318
A husband and wife do a one-time drug deal - the goal's a wholesome one.

20:21.423 --> 20:23.507
College fund for the kids?

20:25.008 --> 20:29.263
No. The wife wants new digs.
Comes off without a hitch,

20:29.430 --> 20:32.724
only the wife decides that the new house would be happier without the husband.

20:33.140 --> 20:34.831
Sharing was never her speciality.

20:35.227 --> 20:36.436
She's anxious to start spending.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.231
Well, it's just an opinion since you're not paying for it,

20:40.607 --> 20:43.234
but the husband is entitled to half of
whatever you buy with that cash,

20:43.526 --> 20:47.822
in fact as soon as you turn it into a legal asset
like a condo or a house or a bank account

20:48.239 --> 20:49.532
he can make a claim on it.

20:50.240 --> 20:50.741
What are you saying?

20:51.033 --> 20:52.660
My lips moving too fast for you?

20:53.536 --> 20:55.204
Not fast enough, as I recall.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.124
Now, now! Keep it in cash.

20:58.415 --> 21:03.420
He's not gonna ask a judge for half of that unless he wants
to spend 20 years in Attica with somebody's dick up his ass.

21:04.629 --> 21:06.006
So, what - hold onto it for how long?

21:06.840 --> 21:10.511
Well, as long as it takes to er, finalise the divorce.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.512
How long does that take?

21:13.304 --> 21:15.514
He'll fight it - maybe 2 years.
Less if you're lucky.

21:16.307 --> 21:17.433
Jesus, Frank.

21:17.725 --> 21:22.438
Well I'm sorry the law doesn't make it more convenient for
you to steal and deal drugs, Bridget!

21:23.230 --> 21:24.523
OK, start the divorce.

21:24.731 --> 21:26.316
Well that's gonna cost you - it's a lot of paperwork.

21:27.108 --> 21:29.528
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fill in the blanks for me - I'm out of town.

21:29.820 --> 21:30.821
Where are you?

21:32.238 --> 21:33.406
Maybury.

21:34.032 --> 21:35.409
I'm going to Chicago to see an old friend.

21:35.700 --> 21:38.035
Well that is the first place Clay'd expect you to go.
Stay put.

21:38.619 --> 21:40.121
You can't be serious?

21:40.537 --> 21:43.124
Look, maybe he won't stall.
Can he afford a good lawyer?

21:43.416 --> 21:44.500
Not any more.

21:46.209 --> 21:47.419
How silly of me to ask! Bye.

22:12.819 --> 22:13.819
Hey, wait up!

22:18.407 --> 22:20.201
Hey, where you going?

22:42.429 --> 22:43.096
Morning.

23:02.407 --> 23:03.115
Morning.

23:06.702 --> 23:07.995
Morning! Beautiful day, isn't it?

23:12.333 --> 23:14.918
Now boys, slow down!
Wait for me.

23:50.118 --> 23:51.912
I can't believe our good fortune.

23:52.203 --> 23:55.623
The fella we were about to go with
wasn't half as qualified.

24:00.002 --> 24:01.795
Oh, you also have to sign here.

24:07.301 --> 24:08.092
Nice trick.

24:08.510 --> 24:10.596
I erm, I still have one concern.

24:11.097 --> 24:13.891
I'll handle your records personally.

24:14.223 --> 24:16.100
No-one else in the company will know you as Bridget Gregory.

24:16.517 --> 24:18.395
So there's no way your husband can find you.

24:19.729 --> 24:21.230
I appreciate it, Bob.

24:23.608 --> 24:24.817
He actually beat you?

24:26.693 --> 24:27.903
Savagely.

24:30.489 --> 24:31.699
That's horrible.

24:34.826 --> 24:36.620
Well. Have you decided what we'll be calling you?

24:40.623 --> 24:42.792
Erm... Kroy. Wen-dy.

24:43.293 --> 24:45.211
- Wendy Kroy.
- Good.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.921
With a K.

24:54.596 --> 24:56.722
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

24:57.097 --> 24:59.099
- I work here! What are you doing here?
- You don't know me.

24:59.391 --> 25:03.103
I've been thinking about you all day.
I can't believe you're here. What are you doing?

25:03.812 --> 25:05.022
What are you doing here?

25:10.693 --> 25:11.694
Look.

25:12.611 --> 25:17.116
If I knew I was gonna be staying in this town
I would have had nothing to do with you.

25:17.491 --> 25:18.700
Well I'm very flattered! Thank you.

25:18.910 --> 25:24.206
As far as I'm concerned any sex we had was just a product
of your imagination. Do you understand what I'm saying?

25:24.914 --> 25:28.002
Well I happen to have evidence to the contrary.

25:30.294 --> 25:32.005
What kind of evidence?

25:32.506 --> 25:35.508
The unrolled latex kind of evidence.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.301
That's disgusting.

25:46.185 --> 25:49.521
I work here now.
Don't fuck with my image!

26:28.601 --> 26:31.894
- Frank. It's me. I took your advice.
- What advice?

26:32.186 --> 26:36.399
I live here. I work here.
I signed a six-month contract.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.400
You're gonna be there longer than that.

26:38.693 --> 26:41.487
I'm an optimist.
Let me give you the address.

26:41.820 --> 26:44.990
No! I don't wanna know where you are.
I'll tell you who does, though...

26:45.490 --> 26:49.494
He's called three times since he got the paperwork.
Something about a loan shark and his thumb.

26:49.786 --> 26:51.287
Anybody check you for a heartbeat lately?

26:52.206 --> 26:54.207
So... What am I supposed to do?

26:54.499 --> 26:56.209
Send him some cash.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.213
Failing that?

26:59.421 --> 27:01.089
Tell him to quit calling me.
I don't need this.

27:04.884 --> 27:05.718
Alright, I'll call him.

27:07.804 --> 27:08.887
Be careful - he might trace it.

27:09.805 --> 27:11.390
He's not that clever.

27:12.015 --> 27:13.183
- Whatever you say.
- Bye.

27:36.581 --> 27:40.417
This is the operator. I have a person-to-person
call Bridget to Clay. Will you accept the charge?

27:40.792 --> 27:43.503
Is this Bridget in Chicago or Bridget in Dallas?

27:44.004 --> 27:45.797
Operator, disconnect this call.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.595
Son of a bitch.

28:11.779 --> 28:14.200
Manhattan... Please... Thankyou.

28:23.207 --> 28:24.500
Well, hello again!

28:27.587 --> 28:29.713
Aren't there any other bars in this town?

28:30.005 --> 28:31.383
Well it's very nice to see you too.

28:31.799 --> 28:33.509
I've been looking all over for you.

28:34.176 --> 28:35.010
Oh good.

28:35.385 --> 28:37.094
It's strange though.
None of the other secretaries

28:37.511 --> 28:38.681
seem to know who you are.

28:38.889 --> 28:41.475
I'm not a secretary you rural neanderthal.
I'm...

28:41.807 --> 28:45.686
Director of Lead Generation.
I'm just trying to get your attention.

28:49.398 --> 28:49.981
That's good.

29:02.410 --> 29:03.287
Don't move.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.078
You're living here now or what?

29:49.789 --> 29:52.584
- For the time being.
- Yeah? Where do I fit in?

29:54.876 --> 29:56.586
Ah, you're my designated fuck.

29:58.004 --> 29:58.798
Designated fuck?

29:59.172 --> 30:03.301
Do they make cards for that?
What if I wanna be more than your designated fuck?

30:04.468 --> 30:06.471
I'll designate someone else.

30:18.274 --> 30:22.068
Hey, How about us going out on
an actual date some time, you know?

30:22.569 --> 30:23.487
Why?

30:28.199 --> 30:29.368
Where you from?

30:32.370 --> 30:35.497
A galaxy far, far away!

30:35.790 --> 30:39.376
I'm just trying to decide whether
you're a total bitch or not.

30:40.378 --> 30:44.674
I'm a total fucking bitch!

31:02.482 --> 31:04.483
I'm having more and more trouble with this, Wendy.

31:04.900 --> 31:06.903
Don't worry - you'll get the hang of it.

31:07.987 --> 31:12.491
I mean you're keeping me at arm's length all the time,
I'm starting to feel like some kind of a...

31:12.867 --> 31:16.787
- Sex object?
- Yes, exactly - a sex object.

31:17.078 --> 31:18.288
Live it up.

31:25.670 --> 31:27.172
Why don't you just stay over?

31:27.463 --> 31:28.298
Gotta get back.

31:28.464 --> 31:30.675
Well then I could come over. That's fine.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.177
My place, my space Mike. Don't get sticky.

31:33.470 --> 31:36.096
What are you so scared of, huh?
What are you so scared of?

31:40.976 --> 31:41.602
I don't know. I...

31:42.602 --> 31:45.188
I guess it's because I've been hurt before.

31:46.982 --> 31:49.567
I just... I don't wanna get close to anyone
right now.

31:51.070 --> 31:55.197
You're different than the others Mike.
I feel like maybe I could love you.

31:55.990 --> 31:58.785
I just... I don't want that to happen. Really.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.162
Will that do?

32:03.998 --> 32:06.666
Fucking doesn't have to be anything more than fucking.

32:08.377 --> 32:10.671
I'm... I'm not asking for love, alright?

32:11.296 --> 32:12.297
Wise man.

32:12.964 --> 32:15.676
We could talk. You could talk to me.
I'd like to talk!

32:15.968 --> 32:16.676
So talk!

32:16.969 --> 32:18.470
Who's listening!

32:18.678 --> 32:22.390
There are things I'd like to know about you Wendy.
I like you.

32:22.890 --> 32:24.391
I would like to know things about you.

32:31.398 --> 32:32.565
Alright, look - you know my name.

32:32.983 --> 32:33.568
Yes.

32:37.195 --> 32:38.488
- I come from...
- New York City.

32:40.198 --> 32:42.367
- How do you know that?
- My phone bill.

32:43.660 --> 32:44.493
Shit.

32:45.870 --> 32:48.581
Look, I like my privacy, OK?

32:49.374 --> 32:50.291
- Let me in.
- No.

32:50.666 --> 32:51.459
Please!

32:52.668 --> 32:53.670
Then screw you!

32:54.378 --> 32:56.797
Right. Tomorrow night. 8 O'clock.

33:25.866 --> 33:27.576
I gotta get outta here.

33:52.892 --> 33:53.976
It's me.

33:57.188 --> 33:59.773
Bridget, so glad you called.

34:00.190 --> 34:01.692
You know the phone booth down the block?

34:05.779 --> 34:06.780
Get the number. I'll call you back.

34:07.281 --> 34:09.282
But before you do that I think may...

34:09.572 --> 34:12.076
I won't let you trace this Clay. Run!

34:18.956 --> 34:21.960
Lay it on man, lay it on me! Come on!

34:25.882 --> 34:26.755
You're beautiful.

34:34.179 --> 34:35.473
Let it ring.

34:37.266 --> 34:38.560
OK, here we go.

34:42.062 --> 34:43.355
What's the number?

34:43.855 --> 34:45.983
555-5163.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.985
I'll call you right back. It'll be ringing.

34:56.659 --> 34:57.453
You're on, Doc.

35:39.783 --> 35:41.369
Bridge. Where are you?

35:41.577 --> 35:44.162
You need to get back to New York.
It sounds quiet.

35:48.750 --> 35:52.169
Yes. Why don't you come back?

35:52.963 --> 35:55.465
All is forgiven Clay? I don't buy it.

35:55.757 --> 35:57.966
- Give me the money back.
- It's mine. You hit me.

35:58.259 --> 35:59.553
- I slapped you.
- It's mine.

36:00.261 --> 36:05.558
Listen, forget about this 'possession is
90% of the law' crap.

36:06.475 --> 36:09.477
The hundred grand that we borrowed is
a hundred and fifty now and the

36:09.769 --> 36:11.355
private detective from upstairs

36:11.647 --> 36:13.148
has a 50% contingency on the rest,

36:13.982 --> 36:16.859
and he wants it very, very bad.

36:20.072 --> 36:25.368
Alright, look. I'll pay off the shark,
throw 10 more to your private detective.

36:26.660 --> 36:28.871
Give me a divorce, we'll be even.

36:30.665 --> 36:32.750
You qualify, you're a bitch!

36:33.083 --> 36:35.544
Think Clay - it's the best you can hope for.

36:38.380 --> 36:38.964
I thought you were...

36:47.680 --> 36:49.266
Did you get anything? Anything at all?

36:54.771 --> 36:55.980
Area code.

36:56.481 --> 36:57.774
What city?

37:00.066 --> 37:01.068
City?

37:06.656 --> 37:08.575
She's in cow country.

37:12.453 --> 37:15.081
- Frank Griffith's office.
- Is he there? It's Bridget.

37:15.457 --> 37:18.376
- He's on another line.
- I don't care if he's on the other line. This is urgent.

37:19.753 --> 37:21.671
I have other clients, Bridget.

37:22.546 --> 37:24.548
I think he traced my call.
I'm outta here.

37:24.881 --> 37:26.759
Ah, just relax.
How long were you on the phone?

37:26.968 --> 37:29.970
- 45 seconds, maybe less.
- Yeah, well that's not enough time.

37:30.553 --> 37:32.848
It's enough time to pinpoint the region.
Area code maybe.

37:33.182 --> 37:36.768
- Yeah, well time for a new area code.
- Well, most fugitives are caught on the run Bridge.

37:40.063 --> 37:41.564
Frank, don't do this to me.

37:41.856 --> 37:45.152
There are 10 million phone numbers per
area code. You got an alias?

37:45.860 --> 37:48.154
Well then just relax.

37:50.365 --> 37:50.865
Are you sure?

37:51.157 --> 37:55.661
Yeah, and look, if you're nervous
about staying alone - don't.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.456
- I hope you're right.
- Bye.

38:44.665 --> 38:45.749
Wendy, I'm sorry

38:46.166 --> 38:49.336
I walked in on you in the bathroom, I really am.
What you walking so fast for?

38:49.670 --> 38:52.965
A woman loses 50% of her authority when
people find out who she's sleeping with.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.843
- That's a crock.
- It's a university study.

38:56.551 --> 38:59.846
Great. Listen. This place is not like that OK.
Around here we're not like that.

39:00.263 --> 39:01.264
Time to shut up!

39:03.641 --> 39:07.144
Get your hands off me!
What's your problem, Mister?

39:09.147 --> 39:12.150
What is this - the corporate dark ages?
Did you see that?

39:56.149 --> 39:57.359
What are you saying?

39:57.733 --> 40:00.862
I'm saying I don't have anything more to go on.

40:01.238 --> 40:01.946
Damn.

40:02.571 --> 40:06.533
Hey. That's my retail business.
Like I got a choice.

40:07.368 --> 40:09.036
I don't like being around this.

40:10.037 --> 40:12.331
- Who is it?
- I'm here to see the Doctor.

40:17.335 --> 40:18.545
Nice place.

40:19.671 --> 40:20.839
What can I do for you?

40:21.047 --> 40:25.134
I need to lose some weight.
I mean, gotta go on a diet.

40:27.345 --> 40:29.138
Well, ThinFast.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.433
ThinFast.

40:33.351 --> 40:36.353
- What about it?
- You tried it, you asshole!

40:37.146 --> 40:40.065
Oh, right. Didn't work.

40:43.067 --> 40:44.737
I think you'll like this.

40:53.244 --> 40:53.828
Charming business.

40:54.036 --> 40:57.957
Hey, it's just trying to keep up with the interest.
Now, you were saying?

40:58.332 --> 40:59.750
I got no more to go on.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.668
What - you aren't quittin' on me are you?

41:01.961 --> 41:06.131
Well you're not payin' my expenses. I can't afford
to go around half the state carrying her picture, man.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.633
The name Bridget Gregory is ringin'
no bells up there.

41:09.052 --> 41:11.553
- Maybe she changed her name.
- Maybe definitely.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.263
Unless you figure out what she changed it to
we got nothin'.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.433
She wants back here. She wants it bad.

41:17.767 --> 41:21.563
She probably is back here.
Now why don't you tell your friends to watch out for her?

41:21.939 --> 41:25.358
If you find her, I'd be glad to separate
her from the cash.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.944
Hey man, you've been big.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.656
You really want to stop it with that.

41:48.546 --> 41:49.964
Harlan!

41:55.928 --> 41:57.429
Wendy Kroy.

41:58.638 --> 42:01.558
It's her name
It's the one she's using now.

42:02.142 --> 42:02.934
You're flailing, man.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.854
No, no, no. I know her.

42:07.356 --> 42:08.732
She's got this crazy talent

42:09.440 --> 42:11.443
where she can write backwards.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.362
New York. Backwards.

42:15.446 --> 42:16.447
The city.

42:17.156 --> 42:19.325
It's all she's thinking about.

42:20.326 --> 42:23.162
Wendy Kroy, Wendy Kroy.

42:30.461 --> 42:31.127
You are beautiful.

42:55.025 --> 42:57.360
- I got your note.
- 5 days ago.

42:57.653 --> 43:00.029
- Apology appreciated.
- Apology expired.

43:00.322 --> 43:04.450
A woman has to protect her standing at
the office. You know that.

43:06.160 --> 43:09.622
Look, I was wrong to touch you but you were
wrong to send me to the gas chamber.

43:09.956 --> 43:12.333
So, maybe I over-reacted a little bit.

43:13.835 --> 43:17.129
You... wanna see my new place?

43:19.924 --> 43:20.633
On your back.

43:20.925 --> 43:24.720
I thought we were going to be more than sex
partners. I thought we were going to be friends.

43:25.052 --> 43:25.846
And this entails?

43:26.138 --> 43:31.434
Talking, sharing, clueing me in to whatever
it is that makes you run so hot and cold.

43:43.236 --> 43:46.323
- Can I trust you?
- You know you can trust me.

43:50.118 --> 43:54.956
OK. Here it goes. Someone steals a million bucks
but, there's a dilemma - she spends it.

43:55.456 --> 43:57.542
Ah, you see this is exactly what I'm talking about.

43:57.918 --> 44:01.754
You're scared to talk about real things.
You're scared to reveal yourself.

44:02.755 --> 44:06.633
Tell me something I wanna know.
Tell me what brought you to Beston.

44:07.051 --> 44:11.639
I don't know Mike. What brought me to Beston?
You're so god-damned intuitive, you tell me.

44:15.518 --> 44:17.936
I tell you what Wendy.
Why don't we talk about me, huh?

44:18.228 --> 44:18.854
Good.

44:19.437 --> 44:23.942
I'm er, I'm a claims adjuster.
I talk to all different types of people in my job.

44:24.317 --> 44:26.152
Some are happy to be hearing from me,

44:26.444 --> 44:27.821
some are scared to death.

44:28.739 --> 44:34.035
A car's been stolen, a child's operation's been botched.
They tell me things that they don't tell anyone else.

44:35.244 --> 44:36.620
It's very intimate.

44:36.954 --> 44:37.746
It's boring.

44:38.747 --> 44:40.750
No Wendy, it's intimate.

44:43.252 --> 44:46.254
I talked to a woman the other day whose
husband just died in a car accident.

44:46.630 --> 44:48.841
It was just a fifty grand payout,

44:49.132 --> 44:52.636
but she said if she knew it was that much
she'd have killed the guy herself years ago.

44:52.927 --> 44:55.638
Said it was the best thing that
ever happened to her.

44:56.931 --> 44:59.725
You see what I'm saying?
I talk to this lady for 20 minutes,

45:00.643 --> 45:03.229
and I know more about her than I know about you.

45:07.649 --> 45:09.026
Her husband sounds like a real gem.

45:09.443 --> 45:12.529
Actually he was a son of a bitch.
I could tell from his credit report.

45:13.739 --> 45:14.823
You can't tell that from a credit report.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.534
Sure you can.
You can tell lots of things from a credit report.

45:18.118 --> 45:19.327
Yeah? Like what?

45:20.412 --> 45:25.125
He had three credit cards, authorised to three
different women, none of which were his wife.

45:28.710 --> 45:29.420
What else?

45:30.629 --> 45:34.633
They lived in the suburbs but there was an apartment,
in his name only, in the city.

45:41.222 --> 45:44.226
- She wanted him dead.
- She was happy when he ended up that way.

45:45.018 --> 45:46.936
Uh-huh. He was cheating on her and you could tell
from the credit report.

45:47.311 --> 45:48.647
Pretty much so.

45:49.314 --> 45:50.815
We can make a list.

45:53.609 --> 45:54.526
A list?

46:09.041 --> 46:14.212
It's like when I got here
- they were gonna use the phone book to prospect some customers. It was a total waste of time.

46:14.712 --> 46:15.630
Why's that?

46:16.130 --> 46:21.343
The phone book's random. You gotta make a list tailored
to the people who are more likely to buy your product.

46:21.844 --> 46:24.346
Mm-hmm. And what type of list are we trying to make?

46:24.638 --> 46:26.224
A cheating husband list.

46:27.933 --> 46:29.517
What do you wanna pitch to cheating husbands?

46:29.726 --> 46:31.811
Nothing. I wanna pitch to their wives.

46:32.146 --> 46:33.022
Why?

46:34.440 --> 46:35.315
Murder.

46:35.816 --> 46:38.736
Murder? Oh, that's very nice...

46:39.944 --> 46:42.321
Your customer said she wanted her husband dead, right?

46:42.821 --> 46:44.114
So, there must be others.

46:44.741 --> 46:47.618
- And you're just gonna sell it to 'em?
- I'm going to try.

46:48.744 --> 46:51.914
There. Men carrying credit unavailable
to their spouses

46:52.206 --> 46:55.042
but available to women other than their daughters.

46:55.834 --> 46:59.045
Owning a home, and renting an apartment

46:59.338 --> 47:00.338
in the same Metropolitan area.

47:00.631 --> 47:03.217
- It's a big list.
- It sure is.

47:04.842 --> 47:08.805
Cross-reference it with inter-state policy owners
of quarter-of-a-million or more.

47:11.641 --> 47:13.225
- Why?
- Profit incentive.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.438
How much? Quarter of a million?

47:20.106 --> 47:20.733
Done.

47:20.941 --> 47:23.235
244 names.

47:24.528 --> 47:25.320
Dial the first one.

47:25.529 --> 47:27.321
- Excuse me?
- Dial it.

47:29.325 --> 47:30.826
I just wanna see if I can do it.

47:35.705 --> 47:37.707
He's home. Next.

47:43.003 --> 47:45.214
Hello, may I speak to a Mr Vincent?

47:45.505 --> 47:48.009
Shit. I think I woke her up.

47:49.009 --> 47:51.428
Oh, it's late.
Cross me for Pacific time.

47:57.017 --> 47:58.017
I'll do it.

48:05.023 --> 48:07.735
Yes, may I speak to a Mr Samuel Renford please?

48:08.402 --> 48:09.736
Oh he's not?

48:11.029 --> 48:14.742
Oh, I assume I'm speaking with Miss Sally Lindo,

48:15.409 --> 48:16.702
authorised user of his First Bank

48:17.119 --> 48:18.204
credit card?

48:22.415 --> 48:24.210
Oh, I'm sorry Mrs Renford.

48:27.920 --> 48:28.921
Please stop crying ma'am.

48:29.421 --> 48:31.340
I'm sure there's a good explanation.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.927
Oh, I see. He's done it before?

48:36.304 --> 48:39.723
Well, you know,
you shouldn't let him get away with this.

48:42.601 --> 48:47.021
Well, I know what a friend of mine did.
Yeah, she had her husband killed.

48:51.401 --> 48:55.113
Yes, there are people who actually
specialise in such cases.

48:57.031 --> 48:59.908
Of course there are risks involved
but there are benefits.

49:00.701 --> 49:03.037
Well, does he carry life insurance?

49:07.834 --> 49:12.504
Yes, I could put you in touch with the right people
but I would have to know you were serious about this.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.506
A definitie commitment.

49:19.010 --> 49:21.805
Mrs Renford you do know I'm kidding, don't you?.

49:24.015 --> 49:26.601
You channel that anger and give him
a nice kick in the balls when he gets home.

49:28.602 --> 49:29.436
Good night.

49:30.312 --> 49:32.607
It's do-able. Your turn.

49:33.399 --> 49:36.109
No thankyou! This is your game.

49:37.402 --> 49:40.197
Our game. You said you wanted to be more than just sex partners.

49:41.323 --> 49:42.199
I do.

49:44.408 --> 49:47.620
Commonality Mike. We don't like to have the same kind of fun.

49:47.996 --> 49:48.913
This is fun?

49:49.330 --> 49:51.999
Yeah, it's bending the rules,
playing with people's brains.

49:57.505 --> 49:58.714
Yeah, well whatever er...

49:59.006 --> 50:00.924
We can go to my place afterwards.

50:01.132 --> 50:02.008
Your place?

50:03.219 --> 50:06.597
- I thought it was your place, your space?
- I have more space now.

50:09.724 --> 50:10.809
You're sick.

50:16.606 --> 50:17.899
You're really sick.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.526
Tell me about your wife.

51:50.819 --> 51:51.820
How'd you know?

51:52.696 --> 51:53.489
I didn't.

51:56.408 --> 51:57.909
That's a good trick.

52:00.620 --> 52:01.413
Tell me.

52:03.123 --> 52:06.125
Not much to tell.
It happened when I lived in Buffalo.

52:07.627 --> 52:09.587
One of those sudden horny things?

52:09.921 --> 52:11.505
You could say that.

52:12.089 --> 52:13.090
Her idea?

52:14.008 --> 52:15.510
Between fucking?

52:19.012 --> 52:20.223
What's her name?

52:22.891 --> 52:24.101
Trish.

52:26.311 --> 52:27.687
Short for...

52:28.187 --> 52:29.397
Whatever.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.317
Is she pretty?

52:39.490 --> 52:41.199
Are you still in love with her?

52:49.416 --> 52:52.002
I thought you were the one that wanted to talk.

52:53.295 --> 52:55.588
You want me to tell you about Trish?

52:58.716 --> 53:00.593
Trish was a mistake.

53:02.094 --> 53:06.014
Boy from Beston moves to Buffalo.
Gets lonely.

53:06.390 --> 53:09.101
Meets girl. Screws up bigtime.

53:11.020 --> 53:12.687
Nothin' to be ashamed of.

53:15.816 --> 53:19.986
I just wanted some more excitement, you know?
I wanted more adventure.

53:20.611 --> 53:24.699
Until recently, all I wanted to do was get
the hell outta this small town.

53:26.701 --> 53:27.910
Until recently?

53:28.120 --> 53:29.704
That's what I said.

53:35.418 --> 53:36.294
Until recently.

53:39.420 --> 53:41.007
What happened recently?

53:44.592 --> 53:46.093
What happened recently?

53:50.598 --> 53:51.182
What happened, Mike?

53:51.390 --> 53:53.393
Can I have a little privacy please?

53:54.811 --> 53:56.312
Tell me what happened.

53:57.604 --> 53:59.482
You happened, alright?

54:00.691 --> 54:02.192
What's so special about me?

54:02.902 --> 54:06.488
You've been out there.
You came here and you chose me.

54:06.906 --> 54:07.614
So?

54:07.906 --> 54:10.700
So I was right.
I'm bigger than this town.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.913
So what's wrong?

54:15.288 --> 54:19.584
You can't stop reminding me
that you're bigger than me.

54:44.483 --> 54:45.691
Good Morning, Alison.

54:46.484 --> 54:48.987
There was a black man here to see you.

54:49.279 --> 54:49.904
What did he want?

54:50.197 --> 54:53.199
He wouldn't say.
He was black though.

54:58.579 --> 55:00.497
Did you tell her about the black man?

55:08.296 --> 55:09.089
Frank Griffith please.

55:09.381 --> 55:11.799
He's not in.
Can I take a message?

55:12.383 --> 55:13.300
No message.

55:24.686 --> 55:26.397
What do you mean you're on the run from someone?

55:26.689 --> 55:28.607
Did you lock the door?

55:28.899 --> 55:31.192
- Go check it again.
- It's locked.

55:31.484 --> 55:32.903
What about the top lock?

55:33.279 --> 55:35.197
- Wendy, it's all locked!
- Just check it Mike.

55:35.488 --> 55:38.908
Wendy, it's all locked, OK?
Locked!

55:39.493 --> 55:42.995
Why in the world would someone be after you?

55:48.501 --> 55:49.292
Do you love me Mike?

55:51.212 --> 55:51.712
What?

55:54.089 --> 55:56.675
- I made another sale today.
- A sale?

55:57.676 --> 55:59.511
You know, like that night we worked late in your office?

56:01.679 --> 56:06.809
Wendy, if you wanna sell murder to people,
if that's how you have your fun, that's fine by me.

56:07.893 --> 56:09.186
It's nothing that I'm interested in.

56:09.478 --> 56:11.772
Yeah but I can't deliver it without you.

56:12.482 --> 56:14.400
We may have a sale Mike but we didn't deliver.

56:14.775 --> 56:16.194
Deliver murder?

56:17.486 --> 56:18.571
I'm gonna do it.

56:21.281 --> 56:26.286
Lance Collier. Financial consultant, retired,
lives outside Miami.

56:26.703 --> 56:28.789
Charms young waitresses with
luxury apartments and credit cards

56:29.081 --> 56:31.791
while his wife Mary Beth sits
at home playing Solitaire.

56:33.709 --> 56:38.088
He's faithful to Mary Beth in one way:
she's the only woman he beats.

56:39.381 --> 56:40.507
She doesn't need the money

56:40.800 --> 56:43.885
but she would like to see him die
with a considerable amount of pain.

56:44.470 --> 56:45.303
You're crazy.

56:46.596 --> 56:48.807
I did a little creative key-punching

56:49.099 --> 56:52.268
and cross-referenced our list parameters
with policy holders at Third Mutual.

56:52.893 --> 56:55.271
You accessed another company's database?

56:55.897 --> 56:57.274
And the good news is:

56:57.774 --> 57:00.777
Our victim does no business with Interstate.

57:01.778 --> 57:03.571
He has no connection to us Mike.

57:05.698 --> 57:08.075
Wendy, you need help.

57:14.999 --> 57:18.377
Look, I'm gonna go out for a while.
You wanna spend the night here, that's fine.

57:19.086 --> 57:21.171
- Talk to me.
- You're deranged.

57:21.671 --> 57:24.299
Mike, the guy deserves it.
Think about his poor wife!

57:26.092 --> 57:28.386
Do you know why I left New York?

57:29.303 --> 57:30.596
To mess with my mind.

57:31.597 --> 57:33.099
Fifteen thousand dollars a year is nothing.

57:33.390 --> 57:35.892
An apartment you're not afraid to walk out of
rents for half that much

57:36.184 --> 57:38.604
and you have to read the god-damned
obituaries to find it.

57:39.187 --> 57:41.898
I'm going back, but I won't live like an animal.

57:43.984 --> 57:44.901
I want you to go back with me.

57:45.277 --> 57:48.779
Really, you do? And all I have to do is kill someone
while you go apartment hunting?

57:49.197 --> 57:50.783
We can do it together.

57:51.074 --> 57:54.702
Wendy, maybe it's my quaint small-town morals
but I don't do murder.

57:55.079 --> 57:56.580
Yeah, well you would if you loved me.

57:56.997 --> 57:58.081
Get some sleep.

58:04.086 --> 58:05.379
Where are you going?

58:05.879 --> 58:07.673
I'm going to play hockey.

58:08.174 --> 58:10.467
Hockey...
I'll come with you.

58:11.802 --> 58:13.677
You're gonna leave me here by myself?

58:15.472 --> 58:16.598
Mike, wait.

58:31.487 --> 58:32.571
I'm scared.

59:01.473 --> 59:02.765
Let's go for a little drive.

59:09.272 --> 59:10.398
So how is Clay?

59:10.691 --> 59:12.900
Pissed. We want our money.

59:13.192 --> 59:15.569
- What? Are you two an item?
- Funny woman.

59:15.987 --> 59:17.196
You're on a contingency?

59:17.696 --> 59:19.865
Fifty percent of funds recovered.

59:20.199 --> 59:23.369
- So why even give Clay his half?
- Professionalism.

59:24.286 --> 59:26.163
Wouldn't it be more pleasant to share it with me?

59:27.289 --> 59:30.876
Lady, you had your fun.
Whatever you spent, you spent.

59:31.293 --> 59:34.378
As long as it's within reason.
But it's over.

59:34.879 --> 59:37.465
- You'd get rough?
- I will if I have to.

59:39.967 --> 59:41.261
I can't get it for you tonight.

59:41.595 --> 59:43.096
- Where is it?
- In a bank.

59:43.262 --> 59:45.681
- Show me a statement?
- I don't have a statement.

59:46.682 --> 59:48.267
But they have this 800 line,

59:48.684 --> 59:51.187
you can punch in the account number,
get a balance - it's a real kick.

59:51.770 --> 59:54.982
I imagine. Pull over at the next phone.

01:00:13.374 --> 01:00:16.459
I assume that was to get me out of the car,
hoping I'd leave these?

01:00:16.793 --> 01:00:17.877
'twas.

01:00:18.588 --> 01:00:20.672
- So the money's at your place?
- 'tis.

01:00:22.173 --> 01:00:23.175
How much is left?

01:00:23.383 --> 01:00:25.177
All but a couple of thou'.

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:28.555
Frugal woman.
Let's go.

01:00:39.273 --> 01:00:43.194
Well, what if I hadn't saved it all?
I mean, come on, you can give me a break.

01:00:43.569 --> 01:00:44.195
How much?

01:00:44.487 --> 01:00:46.863
Hundred grand. I could easily have spent that much.

01:00:57.874 --> 01:00:59.792
How the fuck do you stay up here?

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.879
I mean these people...
I go in the store this morning for cigarettes,

01:01:03.171 --> 01:01:05.089
they got ducks under the counter.

01:01:05.381 --> 01:01:07.258
What? Do they plant these people or do they just grow outta the ground?

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:12.388
And they look at me like...
hell, I don't know.

01:01:13.263 --> 01:01:18.185
Well, you know; they're not used to seeing guys like you around here
if you... know what I mean.

01:01:22.189 --> 01:01:23.482
Is it true what they say?

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:24.773
What?

01:01:25.691 --> 01:01:27.151
You know... size.

01:01:28.278 --> 01:01:29.987
Is it true what they say about white women?

01:01:30.572 --> 01:01:32.657
- What's that?
- No ass?

01:01:34.783 --> 01:01:37.786
Oh, come on; I was wondering for real.
Let me see it.

01:01:38.453 --> 01:01:40.164
Fuck you. Drive!

01:01:41.456 --> 01:01:42.458
I'm sorry.

01:01:43.374 --> 01:01:44.084
About what?

01:01:44.376 --> 01:01:45.752
About your shortcoming.

01:01:46.086 --> 01:01:47.254
I'm not gonna play this game.

01:01:47.462 --> 01:01:48.963
Is that why you carry a big gun?

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.592
The Freudian mind-fuck isn't gonna work either.

01:01:53.259 --> 01:01:56.888
Touchy.
I'm sure your woman is very understanding.

01:01:57.389 --> 01:02:00.266
Exactly how is it that we end this phase of our relationship?

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:04.562
By you showing it to me.
Come on, let me see it. I've never seen one before.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.189
I'll show you my ass.

01:02:08.857 --> 01:02:11.652
What makes you think I wanna see your bony ass?

01:02:12.068 --> 01:02:14.654
- Show me.
- Show me!

01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:16.657
I'm driving. You go first.

01:02:16.949 --> 01:02:18.450
Nah, you go first.

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:22.871
You'll shut the fuck up if I show you?

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.248
I'm sure I'll be too stunned to speak.

01:02:25.665 --> 01:02:26.958
I don't believe this.

01:02:28.668 --> 01:02:29.585
You're crazy.

01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:31.879
Shit.

01:02:39.469 --> 01:02:41.388
OK, there, You happy?

01:02:41.764 --> 01:02:42.555
What the hell are you doin'?

01:03:00.865 --> 01:03:03.575
I'll make sure the press says nothing about your husband.

01:03:06.287 --> 01:03:07.954
I really appreciate it.

01:03:10.748 --> 01:03:12.376
There's only one more question I need to ask.

01:03:13.252 --> 01:03:14.669
I don't mean to pry...

01:03:17.171 --> 01:03:18.756
the man with you

01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:22.885
appeared to be not entirely in his pants
at the time of impact.

01:03:23.261 --> 01:03:25.180
Can you tell me what happened
just before you went off the road?

01:03:26.555 --> 01:03:29.683
Well, like I told you before he tried to
get me to contact my husband and...

01:03:30.768 --> 01:03:32.769
I refused of course.

01:03:34.062 --> 01:03:36.857
Well he became... you know,

01:03:38.567 --> 01:03:40.568
Motherfucker this, motherfucker that...

01:03:41.444 --> 01:03:42.570
Like in the movies?

01:03:43.279 --> 01:03:44.447
Exactly.

01:03:47.283 --> 01:03:51.162
Next thing I knew...
I only remember bits and pieces of it but he...

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.873
the jist of it was that he was going to...

01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:56.751
impale me with his

01:03:59.377 --> 01:03:59.878
big...

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:02.047
There's another man

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.048
waiting to see you when you're through.

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:09.554
I'm through here anyway.

01:04:10.971 --> 01:04:11.972
Thankyou ma'am.

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:17.978
You alright?

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.566
How was hockey?

01:04:24.776 --> 01:04:27.280
I'm very sorry I walked away.

01:04:30.448 --> 01:04:32.743
Wendy, you were just, you were scaring the hell outta me. I mean

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.245
The things you were saying -
you weren't serious?

01:04:36.662 --> 01:04:38.080
What do you think?

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.167
I don't understand you.

01:04:41.542 --> 01:04:43.877
Yeah? Where's the effort to try?

01:04:46.297 --> 01:04:49.174
I'm very sorry I walked away.

01:04:50.842 --> 01:04:53.345
Mike, what I suggested I suggested for us.

01:04:53.554 --> 01:04:56.556
The only loser in the whole deal is a rich, cheating, wife-beating

01:04:56.973 --> 01:04:58.558
old bastard.

01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:00.352
You're talking about murder.

01:05:00.852 --> 01:05:04.939
Yeah? So?
Oh, I'm sorry - it's one of the commandments, right?

01:05:06.566 --> 01:05:07.567
Think about what you're saying.

01:05:10.362 --> 01:05:13.156
Is it the morality of murder that bothers you or the personal risk?

01:05:14.657 --> 01:05:15.657
Murder is wrong.

01:05:16.159 --> 01:05:17.868
Yeah, unless the president says to do it.

01:05:19.661 --> 01:05:21.747
Let me ask you this: if you found out Lance Collier was dead

01:05:22.038 --> 01:05:24.249
would you spend your life bringing
his killer to justice?

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:26.751
Would you go to his funeral?

01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:28.670
- Probably not.
- Would you feel sorry for him?

01:05:29.046 --> 01:05:30.671
No, and this is not the point.

01:05:33.966 --> 01:05:36.761
I really like you Mike.
But I can't live here forever.

01:05:38.137 --> 01:05:38.762
What does that mean?

01:05:43.642 --> 01:05:44.559
Where're you going?

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.645
Gotta bring home the bacon.

01:05:47.563 --> 01:05:50.857
Are you checked out?
Did the doctors give you permission to leave?

01:05:52.567 --> 01:05:54.361
Always looking for the rules, Mike.

01:06:17.757 --> 01:06:19.551
You want me to er, come in with you?

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:20.635
Are you sure?

01:06:22.762 --> 01:06:25.139
- Wendy, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:31.062
OK, I tell you what. I'm gonna go home.
If there's anything you need at all you just gimme a call, alright?

01:06:48.745 --> 01:06:50.038
Guess who.

01:06:53.749 --> 01:06:55.836
Christ, you're dangerous.

01:06:56.252 --> 01:06:59.672
The cops called to confirm that
he was working for me.

01:06:59.963 --> 01:07:03.634
You do know that if you finger me for the deal then
I'm taking you down too?

01:07:06.053 --> 01:07:06.970
I know.

01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:09.139
Look out your window.

01:07:10.265 --> 01:07:13.934
That's Harlan's replacement.
A local. Name's Bert.

01:07:14.645 --> 01:07:17.146
He won't hurt you.
I need a New Yorker for that.

01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:21.317
He's just there to make sure that
I don't lose track of you again.

01:07:22.067 --> 01:07:23.444
He's very professional.

01:07:23.653 --> 01:07:24.861
Can we get past this?

01:07:25.237 --> 01:07:28.366
There is a nice, warm divorce
waiting for you here.

01:07:29.867 --> 01:07:30.951
I want half the money.

01:07:31.159 --> 01:07:33.663
- Not a chance, Bitch-et.
- Don't call me that!

01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:36.748
I'll call you whatever I want.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.753
I borrowed a hundred K from a man
whose first and last names end in vowels.

01:07:42.128 --> 01:07:46.132
Every week I owe him a new ten thousand
dollars in interest

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:48.134
and when I come up just a little short,

01:07:48.634 --> 01:07:51.846
he's got this very fun game
that he plays with thumbs.

01:07:52.263 --> 01:07:55.932
I hired a private detective for 50%,

01:07:56.349 --> 01:08:00.062
but now that I know where you are
I am perfectly willing to spend all of the money

01:08:00.437 --> 01:08:03.857
in hiring a clinical sociopath
to take it from you,

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.943
and fuck you through the eye sockets
JUST FOR FUN!

01:08:10.447 --> 01:08:11.531
OK, look - I'll buy a week.

01:08:12.866 --> 01:08:16.161
I'll buy a week.
I'll send you ten thousand dollars.

01:08:16.535 --> 01:08:21.040
No, make it fifteen so you can get back to your life
while I wrap things up here.

01:08:23.251 --> 01:08:24.335
That sounds interesting.

01:08:25.961 --> 01:08:29.631
Then I come back,
I'll give you the cash.

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:34.051
Maybe you'll be feeling
a little more generous then?

01:08:34.426 --> 01:08:36.345
I keep Bert on your ass.

01:08:36.763 --> 01:08:38.848
Of course you do.
I've given you no reason to trust me.

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:44.144
Only a week.
And I'm still interviewing sociopaths.

01:08:47.148 --> 01:08:49.649
Oh Bridge! What made you do this?

01:08:50.026 --> 01:08:51.359
I don't know. You slapped me.

01:08:52.527 --> 01:08:54.447
That's just an excuse.

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:57.741
Probably right but I get to slap you back.

01:08:59.242 --> 01:09:00.327
Hey, it's a deal.

01:09:04.831 --> 01:09:05.622
Slap you back hard.

01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:16.925
- Yes, I'm still here.
- You must have your name on the ticket.

01:09:17.259 --> 01:09:21.345
What do you mean my name has to be on it?
I'm going to Miami for Christ's sake, not Iraq!

01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:23.139
Well it's a regulation.

01:09:23.223 --> 01:09:26.142
- Oh yeah? What's the pilot's name?
- Erm, Well I can't tell you that.

01:09:27.352 --> 01:09:29.937
Oh, I see. You have to know my name
but I can't know who's driving?

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:32.149
Well, let me ask someone.
May I put you on hold?

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:33.733
Yes, I'll hold.

01:09:36.026 --> 01:09:36.652
Am I interrupting?

01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:42.448
Don't ever come in here without knocking.

01:09:43.242 --> 01:09:46.161
I'm sorry... I knew you were on the phone.
I just didn't wanna...

01:09:46.453 --> 01:09:48.037
How long have you been standing there?

01:09:49.122 --> 01:09:50.249
Just got here.

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:52.459
You going away?

01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:54.127
Yes.

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:57.630
New York?

01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:58.923
Yes.

01:10:02.552 --> 01:10:03.427
For good?

01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:08.850
No. Just for the weekend.

01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:11.816
With everything that's happened,

01:10:11.852 --> 01:10:14.730
I er, I just... I need to get away for a little bit.

01:10:43.757 --> 01:10:47.844
I thought you might be hungry sitting
out here all day so I baked you some cookies.

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:53.141
I'll leave this one to your discretion.

01:11:47.317 --> 01:11:48.443
Take me to Buffalo.

01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:32.025
The husband's name is Mike Swale.
I believe they were married about six months ago.

01:12:32.735 --> 01:12:34.026
I appreciate this.

01:12:49.417 --> 01:12:50.543
Hope that does it.

01:13:09.227 --> 01:13:10.144
Trish?

01:13:10.645 --> 01:13:14.440
Hi, I'm Jean Wilbur with the county health department.
We spoke on the phone about your survey.

01:13:14.733 --> 01:13:15.524
Come on in.

01:13:45.135 --> 01:13:46.011
Let's go.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.239
- A beer?
- Yeah, that'd be great. Please.

01:14:50.739 --> 01:14:52.740
- How's things?
- Life is good.

01:14:53.032 --> 01:14:53.908
Go up to him and tell him...

01:14:54.117 --> 01:14:55.201
Someone's gotta tell him.

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:58.537
Yeah. I'm serious. Go and tell him.

01:15:00.039 --> 01:15:01.540
- Do it.
- Alright, man.

01:15:08.422 --> 01:15:09.214
Hey Mike, how you doin'?

01:15:09.631 --> 01:15:11.341
Hey Chris, alright man, how are you?

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:13.636
Let me get him a drink.
Whatever he wants.

01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:16.221
- Yeah, can I get a shot, man?
- You bet Chris.

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:17.805
So, you still seein' that lady?

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:26.731
Did I ever tell you once I met her outside of here last week.
She said she wanted to ask me somethin'.

01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:30.734
The point?

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:33.738
She said she wanted to know your secret.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.906
"What's the last thing Mike'll want me to know?"

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:39.701
What'd you tell her?

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:43.414
I didn't tell her anything man.
I mean, you're my friend.

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:49.418
I mean, besides, what do I know about Buffalo?
I mean you only told Shep about the wife and everything.

01:15:51.337 --> 01:15:52.005
Is that it?

01:15:59.512 --> 01:16:04.308
She went for me fly and she said
she wanted to suck it outta me.

01:16:10.396 --> 01:16:11.731
Tell me why you're lying Chris!

01:16:14.318 --> 01:16:15.109
I'm not!

01:16:16.402 --> 01:16:18.821
Alright man, I fucking came on to her
and she shot me down.

01:16:19.113 --> 01:16:20.322
Get off him, Mike!

01:16:21.699 --> 01:16:23.325
Get off, man!

01:16:26.619 --> 01:16:27.705
Clean your face.

01:16:59.109 --> 01:17:01.612
Don't be afraid: it's only a machine.

01:17:03.029 --> 01:17:05.908
Hey, it's me - designated fuck boy.

01:17:06.533 --> 01:17:10.620
I know you're outta town but
I just wanted to hear your voice.

01:17:12.496 --> 01:17:17.626
I love you! I admit it. I'm sure you
feel the same way - I'm sure you love you too.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:24.633
You know Wendy, when you first came to town
I really thought you were the one. I... really did.

01:17:26.093 --> 01:17:29.930
You were on the move.
It meant you couldn't stay here.

01:17:36.103 --> 01:17:39.105
I just didn't trust myself after what
happened in Buffalo see.

01:17:39.397 --> 01:17:43.025
I just didn't trust myself to be out
on my own, you know and

01:17:43.901 --> 01:17:46.195
I seem to lose my judgement outside
of Beston.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:48.906
Apparently so.

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:52.409
Well, now it seems to be leavin' me here, you know. I...

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:55.329
try, I really try to believe that you love me

01:17:55.621 --> 01:17:58.706
but you keep treatin' me like
some kind of forage experiment.

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:03.002
You talk about us livin' in New York.

01:18:04.295 --> 01:18:06.923
I mean really, come on, how long until phhht!

01:18:08.591 --> 01:18:13.304
Where'd she go?
Where'd she go?

01:18:16.389 --> 01:18:18.518
If I only knew you loved me Wendy...

01:18:25.523 --> 01:18:28.025
I can't let you hear this!
I can't let you hear this!

01:21:07.718 --> 01:21:08.593
What is this?

01:21:10.178 --> 01:21:11.888
Wendy, you didn't go to New York.

01:21:12.889 --> 01:21:14.307
Why'd you go to Miami?

01:21:17.601 --> 01:21:18.393
Why?

01:21:20.896 --> 01:21:24.316
Did you find this er,
did you find this Lance Collier?

01:21:26.485 --> 01:21:30.196
Wendy did you m- did you murder Lance Collier?
Tell me I'm wrong. Did you?

01:21:34.492 --> 01:21:35.910
Are you gonna turn me in Mike?

01:21:36.201 --> 01:21:38.996
Well if I don't, it makes me an accomplice!

01:21:39.914 --> 01:21:41.582
Christ, you are good at rules.

01:21:42.416 --> 01:21:44.293
Wendy, you don't even seem bothered
by what you've done!

01:21:45.586 --> 01:21:47.087
I did it for us Mike.

01:21:47.379 --> 01:21:49.589
- What bothers me is your attitude.
- My attitude?

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.594
I expect unconditional support from
a lover. For better or worse.

01:21:56.806 --> 01:22:00.183
Jesus! I killed the bastard.
I wouldn't take it back if I could.

01:22:01.601 --> 01:22:02.310
You can't!

01:22:02.686 --> 01:22:03.479
He deserved it.

01:22:03.687 --> 01:22:05.397
- Wendy, nobody deserves to...
- Please!

01:22:05.813 --> 01:22:08.983
Spare me your brainless countrified morality.

01:22:09.276 --> 01:22:11.611
The world's better off without Lance Collier.

01:22:11.985 --> 01:22:14.780
Only ten minutes I knew him he proved it
to me twenty times.

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:18.492
Mrs Collier thought so too.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.202
Jesus Christ!

01:22:20.994 --> 01:22:22.078
There's your fucking evidence.

01:22:23.913 --> 01:22:25.206
And there are my fucking fingerprints!

01:22:25.499 --> 01:22:28.585
Hey, maybe you'll get a reward and
you can open up a fucking feed store.

01:22:29.502 --> 01:22:31.087
Get the fuck outta here.

01:22:39.679 --> 01:22:43.473
You know Wendy, I er, I really
thought you loved me.

01:22:44.808 --> 01:22:46.102
I never said that.

01:23:13.711 --> 01:23:15.003
You son of a bitch!

01:23:16.003 --> 01:23:17.590
Did you sniff my underwear drawer too Mike?

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:21.384
You think you know everything now, don't you?
Well you don't!

01:23:21.885 --> 01:23:23.887
We all have our Buffalo girls Mike!

01:23:24.178 --> 01:23:24.888
You murdered.

01:23:27.306 --> 01:23:29.976
You wanna live bigger but there's
nothin' you'd kill for.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:34.772
There's a place for people like that:
It's called Beston.

01:23:36.106 --> 01:23:36.774
Get out.

01:23:38.192 --> 01:23:38.692
Get out!

01:23:48.577 --> 01:23:50.203
Take your fucking shirt too!

01:24:22.775 --> 01:24:23.567
Come in.

01:24:28.906 --> 01:24:29.489
Yes?

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:31.200
A couple of questions...

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:36.996
This guy in Florida.
He really beat his wife?

01:24:38.665 --> 01:24:41.292
Like a punching bag.
Country boy.

01:24:42.585 --> 01:24:46.589
Wendy, I'm trying to accept this, OK.
I really want to be able to take you back.

01:24:47.465 --> 01:24:50.093
I'm outta here Mike,
I won the lottery. Going to New York.

01:24:51.093 --> 01:24:52.303
I could come with you.

01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.472
You have a way of making a woman feel
like a one-way train ticket.

01:24:55.974 --> 01:24:56.891
It's not like that.

01:24:57.183 --> 01:24:58.183
Get out on your own, Mike.

01:24:58.392 --> 01:24:59.768
- What do you want?
- Nothing you're offering.

01:25:00.185 --> 01:25:00.977
Try me!

01:25:08.693 --> 01:25:10.194
A relationship of equals.

01:25:12.988 --> 01:25:16.367
That means commitment.
I've done something committed, you haven't.

01:25:17.201 --> 01:25:20.872
Oh come on! Murder!
Murder is commitment?

01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:23.874
Yeah, when I've done it and you haven't it is.

01:25:31.464 --> 01:25:33.592
Fine. OK. Who? Who do you want me to erase?

01:25:34.092 --> 01:25:35.385
Who do you want me to kill?

01:25:38.679 --> 01:25:39.180
This Cahill guy

01:25:39.388 --> 01:25:40.598
in New York.

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:45.770
He gets a hold of property tax rolls,
finds out who's delinquent a few bucks

01:25:46.187 --> 01:25:48.564
He pays the balance. Then waits.

01:25:49.982 --> 01:25:54.361
If the sucker doesn't figure out what
happened, Cahill becomes owner of the property.

01:25:55.196 --> 01:25:59.575
You know what he did last week?
He kicked an 84-year-old woman out on the street with her walker.

01:25:59.992 --> 01:26:01.284
That's his credit report.

01:26:02.994 --> 01:26:04.078
Are you serious?

01:26:05.079 --> 01:26:08.666
Double indemnity.
Ten million payoff to the widow

01:26:09.166 --> 01:26:11.961
if he dies an unnatural death.
She's willing to give us a third.

01:26:13.462 --> 01:26:14.671
You called her?

01:26:16.966 --> 01:26:18.593
She said she's bought things over the phone before.

01:26:21.886 --> 01:26:23.680
You try to make this sound reasonable?

01:26:24.473 --> 01:26:25.891
It is reasonable.

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:31.771
You. Me. Three million bucks.

01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:34.399
New York City, Mike.

01:26:37.568 --> 01:26:38.861
It's reasonable.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:40.487
Where does this end with you?

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:42.991
Right then. Right with Cahill.
We'd be even.

01:26:46.785 --> 01:26:50.581
I've just realised that I don't want to
be with you enought to be like you.

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:54.084
Get off me!

01:27:31.786 --> 01:27:35.664
Dear Mike, I got a job at Interstate.

01:27:35.956 --> 01:27:37.959
I'll be moving to Beston soon.

01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:16.870
Dear Mike, I got a job at Interstate
and I'll be moving to Beston soon...

01:28:17.453 --> 01:28:22.667
No-one has to know about our little secret.
I just wanna be near you. Love, Trish.

01:28:38.055 --> 01:28:41.560
I'll do it. I'll kill the bastard.
There's just one thing.

01:28:42.853 --> 01:28:46.356
I am never coming back to Beston.
Not for one second.

01:28:50.651 --> 01:28:53.488
We pull up sticks, we settle in
right afterwards.

01:28:53.779 --> 01:28:55.781
We put all this behind us, alright?

01:28:56.073 --> 01:28:58.159
So what made you change your mind?

01:28:59.285 --> 01:29:03.663
We're gonna have a life together Wendy.
In New York, the two of us, alone.

01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:07.876
Beston Police Department, Officer Lewis.

01:29:08.168 --> 01:29:08.877
Hi, Police?

01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:12.755
This is Mrs Neff, 313 Squire Road.

01:29:13.673 --> 01:29:17.176
There's this strange man outside my house.
He tried to show his erm...

01:29:19.679 --> 01:29:21.180
his diddly to my 4-year-old daughter.

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:22.472
Is he still there?

01:29:22.681 --> 01:29:24.683
We'll have a squad car there in three minutes.

01:30:03.678 --> 01:30:04.554
I'm working!

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:07.265
What are you doin'?

01:30:11.769 --> 01:30:15.481
Hey! She's getting away!
It's my job! She's getting away!

01:30:24.364 --> 01:30:25.658
Give me your cheat sheet.

01:30:26.158 --> 01:30:26.867
Why?

01:30:27.576 --> 01:30:29.870
You don't want it on you!
You memorised it, right?

01:30:37.376 --> 01:30:38.253
Let's hear it.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:46.051
When I get to the Port Authority I go straight outside,
find a cab, don't talk to anybody.

01:30:46.677 --> 01:30:50.473
I have the cab take me to Broadway
and 125th Street,

01:30:50.973 --> 01:30:52.765
I find Cahill's apartment.

01:30:54.267 --> 01:30:59.064
I wait until 11 O'clock, when we're sure the
girlfriend's gone. I wait until the lights go out.

01:30:59.564 --> 01:31:01.774
And a half hour more to make sure he's asleep.

01:31:02.463 --> 01:31:07.738
I put on the gloves. I check and make sure
I've got the cuffs - four pairs.

01:31:08.657 --> 01:31:13.869
I've got the gun, the knife,
the bandana and the flashlight. Keys too:

01:31:15.371 --> 01:31:19.957
to the apartment, to the building
and to the doorknob.

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:24.670
I walk up the stairs,
I open the apartment door.

01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.966
I enter, I shut the door,
I lock the door.

01:31:29.342 --> 01:31:30.677
I find him.

01:31:30.968 --> 01:31:34.973
I make sure he sees the gun.
I tell him not to say a word.

01:31:35.473 --> 01:31:36.766
You hit him hard if he does.

01:31:39.143 --> 01:31:40.978
I close any open curtains.

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:45.565
I turn on the lights,
I tell him I'm just there to rob the place.

01:31:46.942 --> 01:31:51.737
I find a sturdy chair.
I sit him in it. I toss him the cuffs.

01:31:52.656 --> 01:31:56.951
I tell him to cuff himself to the chair.
Left hand, right hand, left leg, right leg.

01:31:57.368 --> 01:31:59.246
Make sure I hear the click of the cuffs.

01:32:00.454 --> 01:32:04.374
Then I er, tell him to open up his mouth.
I gag him, tight.

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:08.170
I then use the gun to knock him out
with a blow to the head.

01:32:10.338 --> 01:32:14.551
And I er, keep stabbing him until he's...

01:32:15.969 --> 01:32:16.844
dead.

01:32:20.348 --> 01:32:21.349
Keep going.

01:32:22.558 --> 01:32:24.852
I take one final look around, turn off the lights.

01:32:27.354 --> 01:32:29.441
I unlock the door, I exit, I shut the door, I lock it.

01:32:30.275 --> 01:32:32.359
I'll get the gloves.

01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:35.946
Why do I have to turn off the lights?

01:32:36.948 --> 01:32:38.365
Pop psychology.

01:32:39.074 --> 01:32:41.744
Lets yourself know you've
finished an unpleasant chore.

01:32:44.246 --> 01:32:45.747
The unpleasant chore...

01:32:50.335 --> 01:32:51.336
You're up for this, right?

01:33:21.364 --> 01:33:22.448
I'm here to rob the place.

01:33:24.241 --> 01:33:26.161
I thought you were the new decorator.

01:33:26.535 --> 01:33:30.664
Just shut your mouth, do what I tell you.
Get up, get out of bed. Come on, get up!

01:33:31.164 --> 01:33:35.043
Sorry. I don't want to mess with
your concentration...

01:33:37.461 --> 01:33:39.048
skilled labour and all.

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:43.551
What now?

01:33:45.345 --> 01:33:47.971
Go ahead and er, cuff your handcuffs
to your legcuffs there.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.433
- That'll be comfortable!
- I told you to shut up!

01:33:59.441 --> 01:33:59.941
Now what?

01:34:02.736 --> 01:34:03.445
I'm gonna gag you.

01:34:05.155 --> 01:34:09.534
How am I gonna tell you where
everything is? Am I yelling?

01:34:10.243 --> 01:34:12.870
You have a gun. I'm cooperating.
Forget the gag.

01:34:13.162 --> 01:34:14.246
The gag's important.

01:34:14.538 --> 01:34:16.457
Did you read a book on this?

01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:19.960
You know, kid, you don't look like a dope-head.

01:34:20.335 --> 01:34:20.960
What?

01:34:21.254 --> 01:34:24.756
I just write prescriptions, right?
I got no stash.

01:34:25.256 --> 01:34:27.258
The money goes to a loan shark.

01:34:27.634 --> 01:34:29.469
I got some aspirin in the medicine cabinet.

01:34:29.761 --> 01:34:32.263
But other than that I got nothing here you want.

01:34:32.555 --> 01:34:35.058
I'm not interested in your drugs, alright?

01:34:35.934 --> 01:34:37.852
You're just breaking in at random?

01:34:38.143 --> 01:34:41.063
Great. The guy next door is outta town for a month.

01:34:42.231 --> 01:34:43.066
Open!

01:34:46.152 --> 01:34:48.946
My wife has jewellery.

01:35:27.732 --> 01:35:29.233
I can't do it Wendy, I can't do it!

01:35:40.243 --> 01:35:42.663
Hold it right there pal, hold it!

01:35:44.956 --> 01:35:45.540
Right there!

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:03.057
Talk fast.

01:36:03.433 --> 01:36:04.725
She's my wife.

01:36:05.351 --> 01:36:07.645
Her name's Bridget.
You know her as Wendy Kroy.

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:11.731
She stole a fortune from me after
making me steal it.

01:36:12.232 --> 01:36:13.650
But she's not willing to give it up.

01:36:13.859 --> 01:36:17.528
But she can't come back to New York
without settling with me first.

01:36:18.446 --> 01:36:20.740
And that's where you come in.
See, she hired you...

01:36:22.951 --> 01:36:25.662
Wait a minute...
Oh, fuck!

01:36:26.955 --> 01:36:28.623
You're into her, huh?

01:36:29.749 --> 01:36:32.961
It's logical: I guess there aren't
many women fuck like her in cow town.

01:36:40.259 --> 01:36:41.760
Keep talking.

01:36:42.844 --> 01:36:44.221
You're a schizoid, talk to yourself.

01:36:44.721 --> 01:36:45.431
You really her husband?

01:36:46.222 --> 01:36:46.932
Who'd she say I was?

01:36:47.349 --> 01:36:48.349
Foreclosure lawyer.

01:36:49.726 --> 01:36:50.560
And you believe that?

01:36:50.852 --> 01:36:52.729
It says so on the mailbox.

01:36:53.146 --> 01:36:53.646
You're crazy.

01:36:54.022 --> 01:36:56.023
It does. It says Cahill on the mailbox.

01:36:56.524 --> 01:36:59.026
Find one other thing in here that...

01:37:05.824 --> 01:37:09.453
She's here. She's in New York.

01:37:12.038 --> 01:37:14.624
She must have switched the label
on the mailbox.

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.632
She must have worked up one hell
of a morality play for you

01:37:21.923 --> 01:37:24.133
but you don't like the way it ends.

01:37:24.425 --> 01:37:25.551
What are you talking about?

01:37:26.718 --> 01:37:29.638
You're supposed to kill Cahill,
only it's me.

01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:32.349
Then she fingers you for the murder.

01:37:33.726 --> 01:37:34.518
I don't think so.

01:37:35.727 --> 01:37:37.020
Oh, she wouldn't lie to you?

01:37:38.646 --> 01:37:41.817
Denial. OK, I'm still Cahill.

01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:44.652
Did she ever happen to mention
that she knows Cahill?

01:37:45.528 --> 01:37:49.824
So well that he would have a picture of her in his
appartment. That's a pretty major omission, isn't it?

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.035
Will you shut up? Shut up and let me think.
Just shut your mouth!

01:37:53.619 --> 01:37:56.330
Take your time.
She probably has the cops heading here right now.

01:38:02.544 --> 01:38:05.922
She has to know that you've
actually offed me first.

01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:08.841
You're signalling her.

01:38:09.842 --> 01:38:10.342
How?

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:13.054
I'm calling her later.

01:38:13.722 --> 01:38:15.723
She's not in Beston, cow-boy.

01:39:09.232 --> 01:39:10.149
Hi, Bridge.

01:39:11.817 --> 01:39:13.528
So you were gonna have me kill your husband.

01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:20.826
I was.

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:23.537
And then tip the Police.

01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:25.539
- No I wasn't.
- Bullshit.

01:39:26.832 --> 01:39:29.542
She tells the cops she's reconciling
with me,

01:39:30.042 --> 01:39:31.628
that's the suitcase.

01:39:31.836 --> 01:39:32.920
Shut up, Clay.

01:39:33.213 --> 01:39:35.048
You have a jealous boyfriend.

01:39:35.548 --> 01:39:38.843
It was a great idea Bridge,
but I guess Mikey wasn't up to it.

01:39:39.844 --> 01:39:40.928
What do you say?

01:39:41.637 --> 01:39:43.138
Is it game, set, match?

01:39:50.437 --> 01:39:51.230
Who has the key?

01:39:52.731 --> 01:39:53.315
I do.

01:39:55.525 --> 01:39:56.527
Oh, fuck.

01:39:58.445 --> 01:39:59.821
Funny thing, Bridge.

01:40:00.613 --> 01:40:03.408
I coulda put this money some place
where you wouldn't have gotten it.

01:40:04.617 --> 01:40:06.326
I might have taken you back.

01:40:08.328 --> 01:40:11.915
You're a very funny lady.
You know the role-playing thing?

01:40:13.709 --> 01:40:16.045
Baby you make one hell of a horny nun.

01:40:21.342 --> 01:40:25.720
What do you say Bridge,
do you wanna stay married?

01:40:38.524 --> 01:40:39.608
What are you doing?

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:44.904
Oh my God!

01:40:54.331 --> 01:40:55.206
Now we have a future.

01:40:55.623 --> 01:40:56.915
You're not human.

01:40:58.125 --> 01:40:59.544
I did it for us, Mike.

01:41:01.045 --> 01:41:03.630
But he was insured.
Fuck me, Mike.

01:41:03.922 --> 01:41:04.631
What?

01:41:05.132 --> 01:41:08.343
It's a role-play.
You're the intruder,

01:41:09.136 --> 01:41:11.013
you kill my husband, you rape me.

01:41:11.305 --> 01:41:13.139
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not gonna kill me Bridget.

01:41:13.432 --> 01:41:15.809
You're gonna kill me if I don't
do what you say, right Mike?

01:41:16.934 --> 01:41:18.519
Get offa me.
GET OFFA ME!

01:41:21.522 --> 01:41:22.814
You're lucky I don't kill you...

01:41:23.525 --> 01:41:24.525
You're lucky!

01:41:24.734 --> 01:41:25.609
Rape me, Mike.

01:41:27.528 --> 01:41:28.528
You're goin' to jail.

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.033
Trish wasn't really coming to Beston, Mike.

01:41:38.413 --> 01:41:39.206
What did you say?

01:41:40.832 --> 01:41:44.711
You shouldn't've told me you never slept with a man before.
It must've been some wild night

01:41:45.128 --> 01:41:46.712
you getting married so fast.

01:41:47.004 --> 01:41:47.838
He couldn't really...

01:41:49.216 --> 01:41:50.341
...how to keep the goods hidden
for a whole two days?

01:41:50.508 --> 01:41:53.928
What'd he do - tell you the little bobbly
thing at the back of your throat was a clitoris?

01:41:55.013 --> 01:41:57.807
You married a man,
you farm faggot!

01:41:58.307 --> 01:41:59.516
Shut your mouth!

01:42:00.016 --> 01:42:01.935
I'm Trish. Rape me!

01:42:02.228 --> 01:42:03.729
- Shut your mouth!
- Rape me!

01:42:04.104 --> 01:42:05.939
You wanna be raped? Is that what
you want? You wanna fucking be raped?

01:42:07.232 --> 01:42:09.025
You wanna play games? OK!

01:42:10.026 --> 01:42:10.902
This is 911.

01:42:13.404 --> 01:42:14.614
This is 911.

01:42:17.408 --> 01:42:18.617
Is this what you want?

01:42:19.327 --> 01:42:20.328
I'm gonna rape you.

01:42:20.828 --> 01:42:22.537
I'm gonna fucking rape you, bitch!

01:42:22.913 --> 01:42:24.831
Miss, miss. I'm tracing your call right now.

01:42:25.123 --> 01:42:26.208
You like it?

01:42:26.501 --> 01:42:27.334
Don't you wanna be raped?

01:42:27.626 --> 01:42:29.920
- You killed my husband!
- God-damn right!

01:42:30.503 --> 01:42:31.922
You're God-damn right!

01:42:32.339 --> 01:42:34.133
You killed my husband!

01:42:34.799 --> 01:42:37.218
God-damn right I did!

01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:40.513
Alright. Miss, miss? I have located you and
I have a car on the way.

01:42:43.598 --> 01:42:45.935
- I'm Trish.
- Are you Trish? Fuck you!

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.607
Fuck, fucking bitch!
Fuck you!

01:42:53.817 --> 01:42:54.901
Is that what you want?

01:43:02.199 --> 01:43:03.702
You like it!

01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:31.895
What'd you find out?

01:43:32.228 --> 01:43:33.313
Lance Collier exists.

01:43:33.604 --> 01:43:37.609
In fact he continues to exist.
He's the guy you described but he isn't dead.

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.403
Right, so she stole her husband's
money just like he told me.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:45.907
But the husband never filed a complaint.
Look at the D.A.'s case Mike:

01:43:46.325 --> 01:43:51.204
you go into a man's apartment with a gun and a knife.
That's intent to kill even if you hadn't confessed it.

01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:54.416
The wife is there, your girlfriend.
That's motive.

01:43:54.707 --> 01:43:57.794
There's a rape on Police tape, along with
a number of murderous threats

01:43:58.419 --> 01:44:01.006
all of which goes to establish
a damn tight case.

01:44:01.422 --> 01:44:03.799
She gave me the keys to the apartment.
She gave them to me!

01:44:04.633 --> 01:44:08.804
They were copies of the originals she possessed. The
jury figures you could have had those made up at any time.

01:44:09.221 --> 01:44:09.805
But...

01:44:10.013 --> 01:44:13.017
There's not a trace of anyone's fingerprints
on those keys but yours.

01:44:13.517 --> 01:44:15.102
The mace was hers!

01:44:15.602 --> 01:44:19.398
I believe you Mike.
But a jury's gonna be looking for elecrical outlets.

01:44:22.025 --> 01:44:27.196
If we had one piece of hard evidence to support
your version of her manoeuvrings

01:44:27.613 --> 01:44:29.825
that would be enought to raise reasonable doubt.

01:44:30.408 --> 01:44:33.911
A note she wrote,
the plane ticket to Miami?

01:44:34.328 --> 01:44:36.831
Phone calls. She made phone calls from my office.

01:44:37.415 --> 01:44:42.419
Your office, and you made all but one of those calls.
She probably faked that one.

01:44:43.503 --> 01:44:44.421
Believe me,

01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:48.301
You don't want a jury to hear about that night.
THINK!

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:58.601
There might be one thing...
