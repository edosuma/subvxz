01:30.383 --> 01:32.468
These guys play the best tunes!

01:32.719 --> 01:35.263
Listening to pirate radio again, lo?

01:35.388 --> 01:37.390
At least wear headphones.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.726
You gotta feel the music
in your bones.

01:39.809 --> 01:42.812
- Isn't this an old broadcast?
- I like this one.

01:42.979 --> 01:45.773
You definitely picked up the signal
at the perfect time.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.067
Maybe the thunderbolts
are bringing it to us.

01:48.151 --> 01:51.446
- Or the Minovsky particles are--
- Thin? Whatever.

01:51.654 --> 01:53.740
- Make me a copy later.
- Right here!

01:54.115 --> 01:56.826
This part is perfect to listen to
before a mission!

01:56.993 --> 01:58.995
I know how you feel.

01:59.871 --> 02:01.414
I can see it now.

02:01.497 --> 02:04.000
Me, flying through the debris,
dodging at the last second.

02:06.711 --> 02:11.674
The vibrations tell me what my hands
and feet should do with the controls.

02:24.354 --> 02:27.023
Everything acts as my eyes as they move.

02:30.193 --> 02:33.154
Can't they do something about
this nasty air in the hangar?

02:33.237 --> 02:36.282
- It's just your sinuses again.
- Cornelius, gimme some tissues.

02:36.366 --> 02:38.368
You better return 'em.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.870
- Thanks.
- Later!

02:44.874 --> 02:46.959
<i>Here is your mission objective.</i>

02:47.168 --> 02:49.545
<i>You are to eliminate
the snipers that are hiding</i>

02:49.796 --> 02:51.673
<i>in our home of Side 4, Moore.</i>

02:52.298 --> 02:56.094
<i>In the past month, over 40 friendlies
have been shot down.</i>

02:56.803 --> 02:59.889
<i>We must never forgive the cowardly
enemy who destroyed our home,</i>

03:00.056 --> 03:01.724
<i>the Thunderbolt Sector.</i>

03:02.892 --> 03:05.520
<i>This war is reaching
its final stages,</i>

03:06.104 --> 03:07.689
<i>and retaking this sector</i>

03:07.772 --> 03:10.400
<i>will play a pivotal role in its outcome.</i>

03:10.942 --> 03:13.569
<i>Renewed prosperity to Side 4, Moore!</i>

03:13.736 --> 03:15.863
<i>Death to the cowardly Zeon!</i>

03:16.656 --> 03:18.574
Preaching to the brotherhood, huh?

03:18.658 --> 03:22.870
Man, my birthplace
refuses to let me go.

03:39.470 --> 03:42.724
Free jazz is perfect
for the Thunderbolt.

03:46.144 --> 03:49.272
I love mobile suits.
And space and the battlefield.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.857
Because I'm free out here.

03:57.989 --> 04:00.908
Oh, crap! They can see
exactly where we are!

04:01.159 --> 04:03.870
If they open fire, we'll just trace
it back to pinpoint their location.

04:07.707 --> 04:11.627
Now, who's gonna draw the short straw?

04:18.551 --> 04:21.137
<i>- Who was hit?!
- Ensign /0./</i>

04:25.933 --> 04:28.144
Commander! Command--

04:28.644 --> 04:31.564
Break-break! Commander Allen
hit by beam cannon!

04:31.647 --> 04:33.608
Suit completely destroyed!

04:33.691 --> 04:35.568
Enemy is sniping from behind the debris!

04:35.651 --> 04:38.988
Radio comms will never reach with
the Minovsky particle density this high!

04:39.155 --> 04:40.656
Just focus on the enemy--

04:41.365 --> 04:42.784
Dave!

04:43.576 --> 04:46.120
Locate those enemy snipers!

04:46.204 --> 04:48.414
How can they see us?!

04:48.498 --> 04:50.666
The Minovsky particles are too dense!

04:50.792 --> 04:53.336
- Calculate their location, damn it!
- It's Side 4!

04:53.503 --> 04:56.005
Are you telling us to
attack our own home?!

05:19.487 --> 05:21.447
Barrel has exceeded lifespan.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.367
This is Daryl, now switching to
trajectory prediction relay role.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.870
<i>Good job, CPO Daryl.
I'll take it from here.</i>

05:27.995 --> 05:30.665
This'll make me a shoo-in
for the Zeon Cross!

05:32.208 --> 05:34.877
To brag to your girl back home?
Or to...

05:34.961 --> 05:38.506
Sean, Ensign Hoover's reporting
situation is complicated.

05:38.589 --> 05:44.345
<i>Lay off! I'm gonna bag 'em real soon!
Both these Feds and all the girls!</i>

05:50.434 --> 05:53.521
Damn, Daryl's good.
Is he clairvoyant or something?

05:53.646 --> 05:55.815
Or maybe he's one of those Newtypes.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.860
I'm gonna get an award back home
and then go on R&R!

06:05.074 --> 06:09.579
Ensign Hoover, is your suit drifting?
Your comms are breaking up.

06:09.704 --> 06:11.914
<i>Please check your cable connection.</i>

06:12.832 --> 06:14.083
They are?

06:19.005 --> 06:20.339
Huh?

06:22.425 --> 06:23.885
Hey!

06:25.887 --> 06:26.721
<i>Hoover!</i>

06:26.846 --> 06:29.765
<i>It's a person!
That's a Fed normal suit'!</i>

06:29.932 --> 06:33.102
<i>Daryl! Do you have a shot?!
I don't have one from my position!</i>

06:33.311 --> 06:34.604
<i>But Hoover might be--</i>

06:34.812 --> 06:37.398
<i>He was shot in the head!
You saw him!</i>

06:49.035 --> 06:52.955
The cockpit's not too different
from a Zaku's.

06:54.832 --> 06:58.502
Yo. You look like the ace
of this sniper unit,

06:58.628 --> 07:00.212
but you have mediocre
taste in music.

07:00.296 --> 07:01.881
I'm disappointed.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.216
Big talk, coming from someone
who only caught a lucky break.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.469
<i>And sneaking around,
shooting people from far away</i>

07:06.552 --> 07:08.721
<i>is the perfect job for folks
with peg legs.</i>

07:10.890 --> 07:12.767
Are you laughing at my legs?

07:12.892 --> 07:15.394
I have your firing positions.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.480
I just need to pick a blind spot
and stroll home.

07:18.022 --> 07:22.401
You're not getting away next time.
Mark my words, I'll take you down.

07:22.485 --> 07:26.989
I'm Chief Petty Officer Daryl Lorenz.
And I'll always be gunning for you.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.951
The name's Ensign lo Fleming.

07:30.034 --> 07:33.162
When you hear jazz,
that's your cue that I'm on the stage.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.209
Patty Page, right?
That was "Tennessee Waltz".

08:20.376 --> 08:23.713
- Oh, you heard this?
- I'm a Royal Teens fan, myself.

08:23.796 --> 08:25.381
For "Short Shorts"?

08:25.840 --> 08:27.508
<i>No, for this.</i>

08:27.758 --> 08:28.718
Ah.

08:28.843 --> 08:31.220
Let me know if you
want to borrow it.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.722
Maybe later.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.647
24 went out,
and this is all that came back?

08:41.731 --> 08:45.067
That's what happens with
ops thought up by that bitch.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.420
Move it to the maintenance hangar!
Top priority!

09:08.299 --> 09:09.759
Lo!

09:15.556 --> 09:18.893
Ensign lo Fleming has returned.

09:30.571 --> 09:34.867
I never did like this guy.
He was such a playboy-wannabe.

09:38.079 --> 09:40.706
Take the body to the Reuse Lab.

09:40.915 --> 09:44.376
It was a miracle that we found him.
We want to return him to his family.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.046
Retrieving the data from
his prosthetic arm comes first.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.131
You're treating him like a lab rat
even after he's dead?

09:49.256 --> 09:52.468
You're all able to fight
thanks to that data, remember?

09:52.927 --> 09:55.137
Prof. Karla?
They're taking the body to...

09:57.556 --> 09:58.224
Professor?

10:06.023 --> 10:07.650
No!

10:08.734 --> 10:10.152
No...

10:19.370 --> 10:21.163
<i>Heavy damage, 4.
Light damage, 6.</i>

10:21.288 --> 10:23.666
<i>Cockpit block only, 5.
Lost, 9.</i>

10:24.166 --> 10:25.668
Understood...

10:27.670 --> 10:32.675
We're currently extracting data from
the Rick Dom that Ensign lo Fleming stole.

10:32.842 --> 10:36.178
It might let us predict the enemy's
deployment and movement patterns.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.179
Fine.

10:37.304 --> 10:41.559
Also, the item is currently being
loaded into a container.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.562
The mechanics we dispatched
are coming back with it,

10:44.645 --> 10:47.148
so I'm told we can begin
startup tests right away.

10:47.273 --> 10:48.858
Who do we assign it to?

10:48.983 --> 10:51.277
I believe Ensign lo is the only choice.

10:51.402 --> 10:52.862
True...

10:53.028 --> 10:55.197
Shall I give him the order?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.200
No, I'll tell him.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.551
A prototype mobile suit?

11:15.676 --> 11:18.345
Did the Moore Brotherhood
front some money to the Federation?

11:19.013 --> 11:23.559
Everyone who outranked you
died in this last operation.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.560
Otherwise, you...

11:24.685 --> 11:28.397
We both got where we are
by our superiors dying.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.065
Isn't that right, Acting Captain?

11:41.285 --> 11:44.246
Let go of my hand,
Ensign lo Fleming!

11:44.330 --> 11:46.540
That's an order
from your captain.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.250
Yes, sir.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.090
So that's how it is...

11:55.216 --> 11:57.384
You never can tell, right?

11:58.093 --> 11:59.261
Where's the Captain?

11:59.345 --> 12:02.348
The young lady is spending
quality time with her man.

12:02.640 --> 12:06.685
She's captain because she's an elite.
The privileged class get all the breaks.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.438
Speaking of whom, what's this about
the prototype going to lo?

12:09.563 --> 12:12.358
Same with him. He's the son
of Moore's old leader.

12:12.608 --> 12:17.446
The incompetent elite let Zeon
invade and destroy our home.

12:17.613 --> 12:21.033
Still, they're the perfect people
to offer up as sacrifices.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.870
The young heroes who lay down
their lives for our ideals.

12:25.162 --> 12:30.876
We'll use those with a guilty pedigree
as Moore Brotherhood propaganda.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.629
That's what this Gundam is for.

12:36.048 --> 12:38.759
I have to stop loving you!

12:38.884 --> 12:41.303
Then I'll be able to
order you to your death.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.808
Go ahead, Claudia.
Order me into battle.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.559
I've been possessed.

12:47.851 --> 12:52.815
By the demons called mobile suits
that shine on the battlefield.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.330
I listened to the comm logs
from the battle.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.001
That Federation pilot
who killed Hoover...

13:12.501 --> 13:15.462
When you hear jazz,
that's your signal that he's come, right?

13:16.088 --> 13:16.964
Yes.

13:18.674 --> 13:23.262
I'm begging you, Daryl.
Make sure that you kill that man.

13:24.430 --> 13:27.683
You're our ace sniper.
You can do it, right?

13:38.736 --> 13:42.990
Prof. Karla. Can I get
some painkillers?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.367
These legs you gave me

13:46.535 --> 13:48.954
are hurting really badly tonight.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.963
You're checking the sniper rotation
intel from the Rick Dom!

13:58.047 --> 14:01.842
You get that, right? You just need to do
that as part of the test flight.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.804
Cornelius, gimme some tissues.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.222
Here you go.

14:07.348 --> 14:10.225
- And gimme some tunes, partner.
- Will do.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.027
Oh, wow...

14:20.611 --> 14:25.074
It's like night and day.
This... is a Gundam!

14:46.387 --> 14:50.682
This is the best!
This power is exactly what I wanted!

14:57.106 --> 14:58.607
Gundam...

14:59.108 --> 15:01.110
Give me your strength!

15:07.366 --> 15:08.909
It dodged me?

15:08.992 --> 15:10.202
No way!

15:13.080 --> 15:15.791
Crap! What the hell?!

15:43.110 --> 15:44.153
It's jazz.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.822
Three Zakus were shot down.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.867
Each one's Big Gun fire was evaded.

15:50.325 --> 15:53.328
This is a heavily armored and highly
maneuverable mobile suit.

15:53.454 --> 15:59.084
This is exactly what the Living Dead
Division is least equipped to handle.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.338
That's the Federation's...

16:03.464 --> 16:04.047
Gundam!

16:10.262 --> 16:12.264
It's him!

17:24.294 --> 17:27.673
Isn't this that song your dad liked?

17:29.049 --> 17:30.342
It's a sappy song.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.554
You think so? I liked it.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.515
Cornelius. Gimme some tissues.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.434
Sure.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.231
<i>Gathered here at
the space fortress A Baoa Ou</i>

17:44.314 --> 17:47.901
<i>are young, elite troops
who have performed amazing feats,</i>

17:47.985 --> 17:50.445
<i>as well the leading minds
of the Principality</i>

17:50.737 --> 17:53.782
<i>who were awarded
the glorious Zeon Science Medal.</i>

17:53.949 --> 17:57.035
<i>Their loyalty was praised
at the staff meeting</i>

17:57.119 --> 18:00.372
<i>of the prestigious
Zeon Space Strike Fleet!</i>

18:00.831 --> 18:05.252
<i>We members of the Zeon armed forces
must become the cornerstone</i>

18:05.335 --> 18:07.754
<i>of the realization of
Spacenoid ideals!</i>

18:17.764 --> 18:19.224
There's no itching
in your mind, is there?

18:19.308 --> 18:20.601
It's fine.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.603
Okay, then.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.026
Beginning recording.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.032
<i>We'll be starting
Phase 6 today.</i>

18:35.115 --> 18:36.283
I heard.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.909
<i>We need to run
checks first, right?</i>

18:38.035 --> 18:39.953
Yes, of course.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.164
Neural transmission shows green.

18:42.289 --> 18:46.418
<i>Step off with your right foot.
Now pull it back, and then...</i>

18:46.543 --> 18:48.587
Good! Now your left.

18:48.670 --> 18:53.300
Switch from right to left in time
with the speed on the bar.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.178
Okay! Professor!

18:56.303 --> 18:59.681
Begin Reuse Psycho Device
operation test.

19:00.766 --> 19:01.600
Roger that.

20:40.657 --> 20:45.454
It's an amazing system.
I bet it'll let us act as more than snipers.

20:46.163 --> 20:49.791
We have far better
artificial legs than those.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.210
I know.

20:52.294 --> 20:56.131
But that system will let me do more than
I ever could with my real legs, right?

20:56.757 --> 20:58.592
You want another medal?

20:58.675 --> 21:01.261
You got one, too!

21:01.386 --> 21:04.681
I threw it away.
I hate war.

21:31.666 --> 21:35.337
Gundam! Let's see you
blow my mind!

21:40.383 --> 21:42.969
<i>Noise level nominal.
All green.</i>

21:43.136 --> 21:43.804
Thanks.

21:44.971 --> 21:49.017
<i>Chief Daryl, you don't think
this place is haunted, do you?</i>

21:49.142 --> 21:50.018
Out in space?

21:50.185 --> 21:55.607
<i>Lots of people died at Side 4,
so I was wondering if sensitives see ghosts here.</i>

21:55.690 --> 21:57.609
<i>Horror movies freak me out,
so I just thought...</i>

21:57.692 --> 21:58.860
Well, I don't see any.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.029
<i>Oh, really? That's a relief...</i>

22:01.446 --> 22:02.322
<i>Ah.</i>

22:02.447 --> 22:05.992
<i>It's terrible, you having to
go out in a Zaku I, Chief.</i>

22:06.159 --> 22:08.537
<i>Even if this is all we have left,</i>

22:08.578 --> 22:10.789
<i>our ace sniper deserves better
than some ancient Zaku I.</i>

22:10.872 --> 22:13.458
A sniper doesn't need mobility.

22:13.667 --> 22:16.837
I'll just shoot any prey that gets
caught in our net, same as always.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.463
This is plenty.

22:19.714 --> 22:23.677
<i>I figured you'd say that.
I hope you avenge our friends.</i>

22:23.802 --> 22:25.387
<i>Well, good hunting.</i>

22:25.804 --> 22:27.222
Thanks.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.072
<i>Fisher! Sean!
He's in your area!</i>

22:45.240 --> 22:46.408
Gotcha!

22:47.576 --> 22:49.578
He's fast!
Try this, then!

22:55.000 --> 22:56.418
Over there, huh?

23:00.630 --> 23:01.756
Crap!

23:08.471 --> 23:10.098
You're mine!

23:13.393 --> 23:15.020
Damn it...

23:18.565 --> 23:19.566
Sean!

23:21.318 --> 23:23.737
Bunch of cowardly snakes!

23:23.820 --> 23:28.575
Can't you fight outside of your
hidey-holes in this debris?!

23:29.117 --> 23:30.869
Hit, damn it!

23:33.997 --> 23:35.916
That was too small!
Fisher, that blast...

23:36.291 --> 23:37.334
wasn't the Gundam!

23:38.168 --> 23:40.587
Where are you?
Where did you hide,

23:40.712 --> 23:42.130
Gundam?!

23:46.927 --> 23:49.638
That was also too small!
Was it another decoy?

23:57.854 --> 24:00.398
Move! Move, damn it!

24:04.444 --> 24:05.820
Now to finish you off!

24:10.367 --> 24:11.493
I see you!

24:32.138 --> 24:36.351
That's one hell of a long shot...
Sniping me at this range

24:36.476 --> 24:39.938
means that it's you,
isn't it, Peglegs?

24:40.397 --> 24:44.275
A thunderbolt deflected the beam?!
I can't believe this guy's luck!

24:44.567 --> 24:48.947
Run, Daryl! When a sniper's location
is given away, he's history!

24:49.072 --> 24:51.408
You're no match for a Gundam!

24:51.491 --> 24:54.452
Crap! I can't see a thing!

24:57.831 --> 25:00.333
Sean! He's still alive?!

25:00.542 --> 25:03.628
If you can predict my movements,
I dare you to fire!

25:03.753 --> 25:06.214
If you're prepared to kill
one of your own, that is!

25:06.339 --> 25:09.134
Shoot! Shoot this guy, Daryl!

25:15.473 --> 25:17.434
Trying to create a distraction
by adding to the debris, huh?

25:17.517 --> 25:21.521
I'll make a path for you. Come closer!
I'll put a shot through just you!

25:25.984 --> 25:28.069
This song has me so pumped up!

25:28.153 --> 25:31.072
When you hear jazz like this,
it's all over for you!

25:35.827 --> 25:38.997
- What the--?
- Light up!

25:45.045 --> 25:46.421
Sean!

25:51.676 --> 25:53.011
Above me?!

26:03.396 --> 26:06.608
With that body of yours,
that must be the best you can do!

26:06.691 --> 26:07.817
Bastard!

26:08.026 --> 26:10.612
It's over, Peglegs!

26:22.540 --> 26:24.209
You son of a--

26:56.950 --> 26:59.285
Focus attack on the center
of the enemy fleet!

26:59.369 --> 27:00.662
Maintain speed!

27:00.745 --> 27:03.665
Keep shooting until we're
out of firing range!

27:07.710 --> 27:11.464
- Two Musais destroyed!
- Ten seconds to edge of firing range!

27:17.262 --> 27:20.515
We sank two Musais
with a single decoy Gundam.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.017
A fine plan, Captain.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.478
That's all we managed...?

27:27.647 --> 27:30.692
Running away again, huh?

28:10.023 --> 28:12.901
I'll dig up a new prosthetic hand for you.
Give me a minute.

28:37.967 --> 28:42.263
Two hours of stopgap repairs will let us
send four mobile suits back into action.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.558
Only one Big Gun remains.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.937
Your team should be prepared
to die rather than surrender.

28:49.103 --> 28:52.774
The division has been ordered to defend
this sector to the death.

28:52.857 --> 28:56.611
If need be, the science team
is to die with us.

29:00.073 --> 29:01.032
Captain,

29:01.449 --> 29:05.370
our experiments have reached the stage
where it can be sent into the field.

29:05.453 --> 29:07.580
But that suit needs...

29:07.914 --> 29:13.127
If you mean the final key component,
I'm sure you only need to give the word.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.895
You have to understand,
Prof. Karla!

29:30.979 --> 29:34.732
This is the only way to save the division
from utter annihilation!

29:34.816 --> 29:38.486
Our experimental unit is the only thing
that can fight that Gundam!

29:38.611 --> 29:39.988
We can't, Sexton!

29:40.113 --> 29:44.701
It has to be hooked up to the nerves from
four limbs to reach its full potential!

29:44.784 --> 29:46.661
We have Chief Petty Officer Daryl.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.498
He just lost his left hand
in battle, didn't he?

29:50.665 --> 29:52.667
What are you suggesting?

29:53.126 --> 29:55.086
Cut off his right hand!

29:55.169 --> 29:56.838
They aren't lab rats!

29:57.005 --> 29:58.047
This is hard for me, too!

29:58.298 --> 30:02.844
How much more of my soul are you
going to force me to give up?!

30:06.347 --> 30:08.349
If you don't help fight this war,

30:08.433 --> 30:12.020
what will happen to your father,
who's in prison for treason?

30:14.355 --> 30:17.734
Now is the time to put your brilliant
research to work for the homeland!

30:17.817 --> 30:20.361
It's for the independence
of space emigrants!

30:20.486 --> 30:22.864
And for the Principality of Zeon!

32:13.099 --> 32:17.395
This is the real power of
the Reuse Psycho Device!

32:17.478 --> 32:19.230
I can crush the Gundam with this!

32:29.073 --> 32:30.658
<i>Attention, deck crew.</i>

32:30.867 --> 32:34.287
<i>Deck 3 and 4's hatches will be open
for landing operations.</i>

32:34.370 --> 32:38.082
<i>Don helmets immediately
or move to an airtight area.</i>

32:38.374 --> 32:40.168
<i>Message from Moore Brotherhood:</i>

32:40.293 --> 32:44.297
<i>Begin all-out assault to retake
Thunderbolt Sector in two hours.</i>

32:44.380 --> 32:45.631
<i>Message ends.</i>

32:45.923 --> 32:48.259
<i>Guncannons, 4.
GM Cannons, 20.</i>

32:48.342 --> 32:51.679
<i>Balls, 12.
Supply containers, 40.</i>

32:51.846 --> 32:54.474
<i>40 relief pilots have also arrived.</i>

32:55.016 --> 32:57.018
We appreciate the fresh pilots.

32:57.852 --> 33:00.188
I guess this was
the little girl's breaking point.

33:00.313 --> 33:01.355
Yes, sir.

33:17.663 --> 33:24.212
<i>Now pressurizing decks.
New pilots, report to briefing room.</i>

33:25.338 --> 33:28.508
<i>Deck 4, mobile suit berthing
operations complete.</i>

33:29.008 --> 33:31.052
<i>Begin closing gate!</i>

33:31.302 --> 33:32.553
<i>Check all safeties!</i>

33:32.637 --> 33:35.681
<i>- Begin securing mobile suits to hangar.</i>

33:35.681 --> 33:36.390
- Hang on, they're all kids!

33:36.390 --> 33:37.892
<i>- Begin supplying and inspections.</i>

33:37.975 --> 33:39.393
A Gundam!

33:40.394 --> 33:41.896
It's a Gundam!

33:43.856 --> 33:45.149
What the--?

33:52.281 --> 33:56.202
They're your men.
Take good care of them, Commander lo.

33:56.285 --> 33:58.371
What a sick joke.

33:59.789 --> 34:01.916
Little patriots, huh?

34:02.041 --> 34:05.586
This explains why the Federation is
sending out multiple Gundam prototypes.

34:06.379 --> 34:10.091
- Hey! Captain!
- Ensign, please!

34:10.216 --> 34:12.217
Screw you! Get lost!

34:17.348 --> 34:19.350
Hey! Claudia!

34:20.893 --> 34:23.938
Wake up! Claudia!

34:24.313 --> 34:25.940
Wait, are you--

34:26.440 --> 34:28.275
You're an officer, damn it!

34:29.777 --> 34:31.779
What the hell are you thinking?!

34:32.112 --> 34:34.907
- How long have you been using?!
- Ow! You're hurting me!

34:36.117 --> 34:36.951
Now I...

34:38.286 --> 34:42.706
Now I understand how your father felt!

34:44.833 --> 34:46.752
When he was ground down

34:46.918 --> 34:50.797
by the reality that he let hundreds
of millions of Moore citizens die!

34:52.550 --> 34:55.594
Lo, you don't know what it's like.

34:56.344 --> 35:00.057
I'm going to order more
people to their deaths!

35:00.641 --> 35:03.477
Even those children who were
sent here like expendable goods!

35:04.395 --> 35:08.816
You should be feeling
this same pain, too!

35:14.238 --> 35:16.324
- That's amazing!
- That's our ace sniper!

35:16.407 --> 35:18.451
A special two-rank promotion!

35:18.534 --> 35:20.745
Here's to the Ensign!

35:20.828 --> 35:22.455
Show us your insignia!

35:22.830 --> 35:24.749
Just this once.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.461
That's so cool!

35:29.587 --> 35:31.047
Want a belt, Ensign?

35:37.803 --> 35:42.016
I didn't mean to...
Sorry.

35:42.642 --> 35:44.352
Don't mind me...

35:45.478 --> 35:49.357
Don't be like that.
Are you guys all weepy drunks?

35:49.857 --> 35:52.693
Thanks for throwing
this party for me.

35:53.819 --> 35:57.073
I'm okay with it, don't worry.
It was an order.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.451
And I want to protect my fleetmates.

36:01.243 --> 36:04.830
In fact, it was an honor to be asked.

36:12.004 --> 36:15.174
These pictures sure take me back.

36:16.217 --> 36:19.387
I remember the Colony Air Race
like it was yesterday.

36:20.805 --> 36:23.391
That was such a huge win.

36:24.141 --> 36:29.563
We did everything ourselves, didn't we?
From the planning to the sponsor hunting.

36:31.774 --> 36:35.653
I thought that we could
do everything ourselves.

36:37.238 --> 36:41.158
I still see those days in my dreams.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.577
Drugs can't take you back.

36:44.662 --> 36:47.665
Lo doesn't actually enjoy war.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.210
He's just the type of person
who only feels alive

36:51.293 --> 36:54.672
when he pushes himself to the limit.

36:55.339 --> 36:59.885
He can only live
in the madness of war.

37:00.761 --> 37:02.888
I feel sorry for him.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.732
Ensign Daryl!

37:12.815 --> 37:14.024
We'll be heading out first.

37:35.546 --> 37:38.174
My father is a historian.

37:39.258 --> 37:42.470
He's in prison right now
as a dissident.

37:43.888 --> 37:48.893
The military said he'd be spared if I helped
the war effort with my research.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.438
My father was the sort of man
who kept on fighting

37:52.563 --> 37:57.318
even after many attempts on
his life and losing his left hand,

37:58.235 --> 38:03.240
but I did as I was told
and cut off your right arm.

38:05.659 --> 38:08.829
Out of ego and self-preservation.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.414
Let's survive this.

38:12.875 --> 38:16.337
Let's survive and laugh from
the bottom of our hearts someday.

38:18.506 --> 38:23.427
This irrational reality is the real enemy
that's making us suffer.

38:25.012 --> 38:29.016
Those of us who live in times of war
undergo lots of little ordeals,

38:29.683 --> 38:33.020
and maybe it's a miracle
just to survive in this war,

38:34.355 --> 38:39.693
but I'm sure that there are miracles
even in lives as dark as ours.

38:50.371 --> 38:54.375
I want to laugh from
the bottom of my heart.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.730
<i>- Ensign Daryl.
- Yes, sir.</i>

39:16.981 --> 39:19.733
<i>Everything hinges on your success.</i>

39:20.025 --> 39:23.195
<i>I apologize for being unable to salute,
but roger that, sir.</i>

39:23.612 --> 39:25.239
We're all counting on you.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.208
Daryl Lorenz, launching.

39:48.262 --> 39:51.015
Move closer!
Closer, closer!

39:51.932 --> 39:56.770
Our mobile suit force will begin
the operation at 2400 hours.

39:57.354 --> 39:59.440
Act as my shield.

39:59.773 --> 40:02.943
I'll be avoiding
any random skirmishes en route.

40:03.694 --> 40:06.322
The Full Armor Gundam's sole mission

40:06.405 --> 40:10.910
is to destroy the enemy fleet and
eliminate the enemy's ace sniper.

40:12.161 --> 40:16.290
This is a messed-up world where
someone who kills lots of people

40:16.415 --> 40:18.292
gets praised as a hero.

40:18.834 --> 40:22.296
An endless loop of
planning ops and fighting.

40:22.421 --> 40:26.926
Even if the players change,
the mission we call war continues.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.596
Try to ignore it all you want,
but there's no escaping it.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.308
I love mobile suits.

40:34.433 --> 40:38.312
I'm hopelessly in love with
these machines that amplify my abilities.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.397
It gets me fired up from head to toe.

40:41.357 --> 40:45.486
Call it bad karma
or sinful or whatever,

40:46.028 --> 40:48.739
but I'll break free of anything
that ties me down

40:49.156 --> 40:52.910
and keep fighting to the brink of hell itself.

40:53.744 --> 40:57.957
Farewell, my brother and sister
fellow expendables.

40:58.374 --> 41:01.168
If any of us survive, I'm buying.

41:07.007 --> 41:08.092
This is lo Fleming.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.928
Full Armor Gundam, launching!

41:22.314 --> 41:24.692
All you innocent children...

41:25.317 --> 41:27.361
Please, come back safely.

41:27.486 --> 41:29.530
As many as possible.

41:36.829 --> 41:40.165
Damn, they're like tidy candles
on a birthday cake out there.

41:40.749 --> 41:43.168
But they just have numbers...

41:48.882 --> 41:50.884
- Philip!
- Where is he?!

41:51.093 --> 41:53.387
- <i>H0/d fire! Hold fire!
- People have</i> been hit!

41:53.512 --> 41:57.349
We can't win with uncoordinated fire!
We'll be wiped out like this!

41:59.184 --> 42:00.310
Okay, then...

42:01.812 --> 42:04.231
If I can keep their formation split up...

42:06.775 --> 42:09.069
...this'll be easier than slicing
a cake with a knife.

42:09.862 --> 42:13.240
<i>We have to do it like in training!
Link up with each other!</i>

42:13.407 --> 42:15.993
- Crap, we lost another!
- Shut up! Don't break forma--

42:16.577 --> 42:17.536
Chief!

42:17.870 --> 42:20.581
Crap, they've started forming up again!

42:21.206 --> 42:26.837
Man, it's been forever since the last time
I had a slice of Grandma's apple tart.

42:36.096 --> 42:37.765
<i>We got him... We got him!</i>

42:41.185 --> 42:43.103
I'll be joining you soon!

42:54.114 --> 42:57.242
Now on penetration route.
Everything going according to plan.

42:57.701 --> 43:01.622
Target acquired. Take it from here,
Petty Officer Layton.

43:01.872 --> 43:02.873
Roger that.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.214
Gotta wait 200 seconds...

43:10.547 --> 43:12.633
Keep it together, Layton!

43:13.133 --> 43:14.426
Prof. Karla!

43:14.718 --> 43:17.596
Are you planning to go down with this ship?

43:18.263 --> 43:20.224
Thanks to my work with that weapon,

43:20.349 --> 43:24.103
I've learned how the world works
and realized what a fool I am.

43:24.186 --> 43:25.938
Thank you, Sexton.

43:26.063 --> 43:29.650
We should escape! If we bring your research
back to the homeland, Zeon can--

43:29.775 --> 43:31.610
Escape by yourself.

43:31.693 --> 43:34.988
The device is complete.
You don't have to babysit me anymore, right?

43:35.155 --> 43:36.615
No, but--

43:37.783 --> 43:38.992
The data!

43:42.162 --> 43:43.330
Professor!

43:43.872 --> 43:46.667
I don't believe it...
Fine, have it your way!

43:58.095 --> 43:59.263
<i>Professor!</i>

43:59.388 --> 44:03.350
<i>Relax! Do it like in your military
training and you'll be fine!</i>

44:14.236 --> 44:15.863
<i>It's the Gundam!</i>

44:23.871 --> 44:26.373
Damn you, Gundam!

44:43.682 --> 44:44.391
It's time!

44:52.024 --> 44:54.359
I did it!
I did it, Ensign!

44:54.443 --> 44:56.195
I did it! I did--

45:57.089 --> 45:58.966
Engineering hit!

45:59.174 --> 46:00.759
Give me a damage report!

46:01.343 --> 46:04.096
We can't afford to go down here--

46:15.732 --> 46:18.068
Load the wounded into the pods first!

46:18.151 --> 46:20.237
This one is packed, too...

46:20.529 --> 46:22.406
- This man's injured!
- Give us a hand!

46:22.823 --> 46:25.117
- Hey, are you all right?
- Let's get him into a pod!

46:25.200 --> 46:26.159
Right.

46:39.506 --> 46:40.674
Graham!

46:41.883 --> 46:44.428
XO Graham, are you all right?

46:48.140 --> 46:49.683
Get your hands off me.

46:50.225 --> 46:53.979
The ship's about to go up.
I've given the order to abandon ship.

46:54.062 --> 46:55.689
You did what?

46:56.606 --> 46:58.317
You're abandoning ship?!

47:00.319 --> 47:05.657
You incompetent elites... First you cost us
our homeland, and now our fleet!

47:06.700 --> 47:11.204
You think I can look my late wife
and daughter in the eye if I run?

47:11.371 --> 47:12.664
Graham...

47:13.415 --> 47:15.751
For the honor of Moore.

47:20.756 --> 47:22.799
I'll be joining you.

47:46.907 --> 47:48.742
Claudia?

47:50.535 --> 47:52.079
Hey, what was that light?

47:52.162 --> 47:53.914
That blast was huge!

47:53.997 --> 47:56.416
That wasn't our mothership, was it?

47:58.126 --> 48:00.754
The battle's not over yet.

48:00.921 --> 48:04.174
There's still a powerful enemy in there.

48:04.716 --> 48:07.594
He wasn't in this combat zone.

48:10.222 --> 48:12.265
It's you, isn't it?

48:51.805 --> 48:53.473
<i>We've received intel that
the Living Dead Division's battle</i>

48:53.598 --> 48:56.059
<i>has spread from Banchi 3
to Banchi 2.</i>

48:56.184 --> 48:58.395
<i>- Tell all the reinforcements!
- Roger that!</i>

49:06.778 --> 49:09.156
Daryl... Guys...

49:09.448 --> 49:12.951
Hold out until these reinforcements arrive.

50:36.284 --> 50:39.079
Damn it, die already!

50:46.253 --> 50:50.006
Karla, this is amazing!
This mobile suit you built for me

50:50.674 --> 50:54.177
is way better than
the arms and legs I lost!

50:55.512 --> 50:59.432
The enemy flagship is dead in space
from a friendly mobile suit force attack.

50:59.558 --> 51:02.269
Multiple Zeon troops
are still alive inside.

51:02.435 --> 51:04.396
We are en route to board
and take the enemy ship.

51:04.938 --> 51:06.189
Take the ship?

51:06.273 --> 51:09.609
This lifeboat doesn't have enough oxygen.

51:11.194 --> 51:13.780
<i>Chief Petty Officer Chiba
will take point in a Ball.</i>

51:21.371 --> 51:24.791
- Cornelius, you ever shoot anyone?
- No.

51:25.709 --> 51:29.796
I finally understand why he wants
to listen to music in battle.

52:31.149 --> 52:34.152
I can do this...
I can take him!

52:42.535 --> 52:46.539
The engine room's that way.
Take your men and secure Engineering.

52:46.665 --> 52:50.043
- But we're just mechanics...
- You've had training!

52:50.794 --> 52:52.045
Roger that.

53:07.894 --> 53:09.145
There's air.

53:09.229 --> 53:12.065
They must be up where
this music is coming from.

53:24.202 --> 53:26.413
Thank you, Prof. Karla.

53:26.579 --> 53:29.749
This explosion should spread
through the entire ship.

53:29.874 --> 53:33.920
Let's take them all with us
and put an end to this nightmare.

53:34.838 --> 53:37.257
Freeze! All of you,
stay where you are!

53:37.340 --> 53:41.261
We're the Earth Federation Forces
Moore Brotherhood!

53:41.344 --> 53:44.848
This ship is under our control!
Surrender yourselves peacefully!

53:44.931 --> 53:46.599
Is the person in charge here?

53:47.308 --> 53:49.436
Who's the ranking officer?!

53:57.152 --> 54:00.613
No Zeon soldier would live with
the disgrace of being taken prisoner.

54:00.697 --> 54:04.284
He's right! It's a matter of
a soldier's honor and pride! Never!

54:07.162 --> 54:09.581
Die, Gundam!

54:10.665 --> 54:14.919
Daryl, I won't let you die alone.

54:15.003 --> 54:15.879
I'll join you.

54:17.464 --> 54:19.132
This Will kill you!

54:25.346 --> 54:26.806
Let's do this.

54:27.223 --> 54:28.725
- Sieg--
- Wait!

54:43.031 --> 54:48.328
This has to end! How long is the hatred
and killing going to go on?

54:48.745 --> 54:52.665
It has to end.
This... has to end.

54:55.376 --> 54:58.588
All of you, come here!
Get a move on!

54:58.671 --> 55:00.632
Why hasn't there been an explosion?

55:00.715 --> 55:04.844
Maybe they failed...
Plan B. Switch to Plan B.

55:04.969 --> 55:07.305
Blowing yourselves up is pointless!
This has to stop.

55:07.388 --> 55:10.850
We won't be taken prisoner!
We'll take you out with us!

55:10.975 --> 55:14.687
- You took our families and loved ones!
- You'll feel our hatred!

55:15.230 --> 55:18.358
We've endured plenty of suffering ourselves!

55:18.441 --> 55:21.778
This sector is where
our colonies used to be!

55:21.861 --> 55:23.863
It's where our homeland was!

55:23.988 --> 55:26.449
- Homeland?
- They're from Side 4?

55:26.825 --> 55:31.371
That's right. Our home was taken,
our mothership was destroyed,

55:31.454 --> 55:33.540
and now there's only
a handful of us left!

55:33.873 --> 55:36.543
I don't want to see
any more of us die!

55:36.876 --> 55:39.462
Let's figure out a way
to survive this together!

55:39.546 --> 55:42.048
Fighting until we're both wiped out

55:42.340 --> 55:43.800
is just stupid!

55:45.593 --> 55:47.220
What are you--

56:11.661 --> 56:14.330
- It worked!
- It was a longshot, but it worked!

56:30.346 --> 56:32.098
This thing's built tough, all right.

56:32.265 --> 56:34.851
If I ditch the extra armor,
I can still fight!

56:45.320 --> 56:48.740
I'm gonna put an end to this.
I'll kill him.

56:58.917 --> 57:01.628
Hurry up!
We can't hold them off!

57:03.755 --> 57:04.380
Whoa!

57:06.758 --> 57:08.468
Sieg Zeon!

57:11.429 --> 57:14.140
Oh, come on! Not after we made it
all the way to the magazine!

58:02.522 --> 58:05.817
When you hear my jazz,
that's when you die!

58:06.693 --> 58:08.945
Peglegs!

59:00.538 --> 59:03.708
Why?! Why can't I beat him?!

59:05.293 --> 59:06.919
I get it now, Karla.

59:07.837 --> 59:11.883
When I met you,
that was my miracle.

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:03.643
No way!

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:08.606
He's missing all his limbs?
I lost to a guy like this?!

01:01:13.629 --> 01:01:16.966
I see. Claudia isn't with you?

01:01:17.216 --> 01:01:20.678
She was the ship's captain,
so she probably...

01:01:35.568 --> 01:01:38.905
Thanks. The reinforcements
you brought saved us, Fisher.

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:42.408
No, I just did it without thinking.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.662
We lost the Psycho Zaku, though.

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:48.664
How do we report this?

01:01:49.582 --> 01:01:54.003
When Prof. Karla recovers,
the Reuse Psycho Device will be mass-produced.

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:58.716
More pilots will probably decide
to take on the same fate as you.

01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:04.513
Yeah, the Reuse Psycho Device can turn
even average pilots into supermen.

01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:10.937
They only have to cut off their limbs.
Just like I did.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.109
That's enough, Living Dead Division!
Torture is a treaty violation!

01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:20.613
As a Special Service member,
I can no longer turn a blind eye.

01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:24.909
We understand, sir.
Our apologies.

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:30.915
Go ahead. You have five minutes.
Audio and video will be recorded.

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:33.042
Thank you.

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:37.421
Lo Fleming...

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:40.466
Son of the former leader of Side 4.

01:02:40.633 --> 01:02:43.427
Attached to the Earth Federation Forces'
Moore Brotherhood.

01:02:43.552 --> 01:02:48.140
And notorious Gundam pilot.

01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:54.272
Daryl Lorenz...

01:02:54.355 --> 01:02:58.985
C'mon, tell me.
How do you pilot a mobile suit

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:01.821
with that pathetic,
crippled body of yours?

01:03:04.657 --> 01:03:07.660
I wanted to put an end
to this by killing you.

01:03:08.244 --> 01:03:10.496
I thought if I could defeat the Gundam,

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:13.624
it would set me free from
the nightmare of war.

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.668
Nightmare?

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:20.339
You're playing the victim
after all you've done?

01:03:20.423 --> 01:03:22.967
You beat my Gundam with
power you gained

01:03:23.092 --> 01:03:25.845
by offering up your body
to your mobile suit.

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:27.847
Helluva rush, isn't it?

01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:32.977
Even as we curse war, we become
more and more obsessed with it.

01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:39.358
It's our fate to go on fighting.

01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:49.660
This war isn't going to end just yet.

01:08:53.589 --> 01:08:55.506
