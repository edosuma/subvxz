00:22.147 --> 00:24.732
MALE NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.026
ADAMA: Aurora,
goddess of the dawn.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.779
STARBUCK: I thought that it would be
a nice figurehead for your model ship.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.072
A fresh start.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.240
Thank you.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.992
APOLLO: Starbuck,
you're getting too low!

00:35.077 --> 00:36.661
Come on, Lee,
get her out of there.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.787
You come back!

00:37.871 --> 00:38.996
Just let me go.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.458
No!

00:42.918 --> 00:44.627
Baltar's trial may
have been the trigger,

00:44.712 --> 00:47.672
but this is a feeling I've
been having for a while.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.298
It's time for a change.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.719
BALTAR: Please, God,
don't let this child die.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.596
How can you take him
and let me live?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.640
God answered your prayers.
You have to see.

00:58.684 --> 00:59.726
JEANNE: Look at him.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.436
BALTAR: And no trace
of a fever.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.104
JEANNE: It's a miracle.

01:03.647 --> 01:07.859
ROSLIN: I need to know about the
other five. The types we've never seen.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.319
It's true.
We're Cylons.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.947
And we have been
from the start.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.451
SAM: You know, after that Raider
scanned me with that red light,

01:16.535 --> 01:17.994
damn thing
just cut and ran.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.912
TYROL: You think it
recognized you as a Cylon?

01:19.997 --> 01:21.497
Maybe that's why
it didn't shoot me.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.708
More important,
why didn't I shoot him?

01:24.501 --> 01:27.295
Okay, what the hell's going on?
I'm off the ship for a few hours,

01:27.379 --> 01:28.379
and everybody's acting...

01:28.464 --> 01:29.630
A few hours?

01:29.715 --> 01:32.425
Kara, you were gone
for over two months.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.843
That's impossible.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.553
How did you get here?

01:35.637 --> 01:37.638
I told you,
I don't know exactly.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.349
Damn it, they're still
going in the wrong direction.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.477
One more jump and I'm gonna
lose my way all together.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.895
It's Roslin.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.772
The old man's not
gonna listen to me.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.273
I gotta get to her.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.858
No, no, wait!

02:09.046 --> 02:10.797
Look alive!
And for frak's sake,

02:10.881 --> 02:12.507
don't shoot
the godsdamned President!

02:12.591 --> 02:13.800
Just let me
talk to her.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.469
Talk all you want, but it
ends with the first bang.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.222
TIGH: We're rolling down here.
Starbuck's got the President.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.057
Gaeta, take the com.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.649
Move.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.194
Move!

02:42.621 --> 02:43.663
Come on.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.748
Move, come on!

02:47.584 --> 02:49.252
Over by the couch.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.753
Now!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.269
I want to hate you so much.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.106
So much.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.281
You had a vision.
Remember?

03:19.491 --> 03:21.617
The arrow, the temple.

03:22.452 --> 03:26.831
I went down to that planet with you,
and it was a frakking Toaster party.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.458
A lot of good people died.
Remember?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.252
Yes, I do.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.337
I trusted you.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.840
On a vision.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.051
That's it.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.012
A vision!

03:42.973 --> 03:45.474
I saw Earth.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.312
I saw it with my own eyes.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.982
And it's calling me back.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.359
We're going the wrong way.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.613
Why can't you trust me?

04:00.115 --> 04:01.574
(COCKS GUN)

04:02.659 --> 04:03.951
Shoot me.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.497
If you think I'm a Cylon,
then I'm your enemy.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.708
Shoot your enemy.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.380
Take it!

04:22.012 --> 04:24.430
I'm no more a Cylon
than you are.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.349
And you know it.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.394
I wish I did.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.068
I've put my life on the
line for this frakking ship.

04:37.152 --> 04:40.613
I have ate, slept and fought
next to the people that I love.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.823
I have pissed off
my friends!

04:42.908 --> 04:44.784
I have broken more
rules than I've followed!

04:44.868 --> 04:47.453
I frakked up, okay!
I messed up!

04:50.540 --> 04:52.541
But it's all that I have.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.629
Those people are my family.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.383
And none of us belong here.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.928
Two down.
We've got two down!

05:04.888 --> 05:07.264
Shoot me!
If I'm a Cylon, shoot me!

05:07.349 --> 05:09.892
They made you perfect,
didn't they?

05:11.395 --> 05:12.812
MAN: Shots fired!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.362
Down on the floor. Down
on the floor now! Now!

05:21.446 --> 05:22.780
Let go of me!

05:22.948 --> 05:24.907
Get off my... Get off me!

05:25.242 --> 05:28.244
What are you doing? I
am not a Cylon, Mathias!

05:28.370 --> 05:29.453
Madam President.

05:29.538 --> 05:30.705
Mathias! Gods!

05:30.789 --> 05:32.456
(PANTING) I don't...

05:32.541 --> 05:33.666
ADAMA: What the frak's
going on here?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.834
I thought
you were on the move.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.545
We were. She's out
of her frakking mind!

05:37.629 --> 05:38.754
Gods!
You all right?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.256
Get off me!

05:41.133 --> 05:43.592
(PANTING) Get off!

05:49.016 --> 05:50.850
Listen to me, please.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.602
I'm losing it.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.896
The ringing.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.815
The way to Earth.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.276
It's getting weaker.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.279
Don't you understand?

06:04.781 --> 06:06.949
Don't any
of you understand?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.662
It was so...
It was so clear.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.083
Like it was coming
from the next room.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.795
Stop looking at me like that.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.092
I can feel it slipping away.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.846
Even without jumping,
as we move,

06:30.432 --> 06:33.267
it's half of what it was
when I got here.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.103
Half.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.191
If we keep jumping,
it'll be gone,

06:40.275 --> 06:42.359
and we'll never
find it again.

06:43.779 --> 06:47.031
I thought that's what
we wanted. A way to Earth.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.824
Do you hear me?

06:48.909 --> 06:49.909
Get her out of here.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.077
MAN: Yes, sir. Let's go.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.663
You better work on your aim,
because I'm not gonna stop!

06:55.082 --> 06:57.333
You're gonna have to kill me!

06:58.126 --> 07:00.795
One more jump
and it'll be gone!

07:01.171 --> 07:02.505
Admiral!

07:54.850 --> 07:57.935
HYBRID: The excited state
decays by vibrational relaxation

07:58.019 --> 08:00.187
into the first
excited singlet state.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.398
Yes, yes,
and merrily we go.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.068
Reduce atmospheric
nitrogen by 0.03%.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.697
It is not much consolation that
society will pick up the bits.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.948
Leaving us
at eight modern,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.993
where punishment rather than
interdiction is paramount.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.954
Please cut the fuse. They
will not harm their own.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.291
End of line. Limiting
diffusions to two dimensions

08:20.375 --> 08:24.170
increases the number of evolutionary
jumps within the species.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.755
Rise and measure
the Temple of the Five.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.926
Transformation is the goal.
They will not harm their own.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.512
Data-font
synchronization complete.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.140
The Hybrid is clearly
telling us something.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.683
The Hybrid is always
telling us something.

08:37.767 --> 08:43.063
They are supposed to maintain operations
on each ship, not vomit metaphysics.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.611
All right. I give up.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.863
What? What is she
trying to tell us?

08:50.947 --> 08:54.200
They're in the Colonial Fleet
with the humans.

08:55.452 --> 08:59.163
They? They who?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.874
The Final Five.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.710
The Raiders
refused to fight

09:04.794 --> 09:07.046
because they sensed the Final Five
might be in the Colonial Fleet.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.590
They could have been caught.
They could be in hiding.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.301
No, wait, stop.
Stop right now.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.595
Turn around. Go and
take a cleansing walk.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.181
And I'm gonna try and
forget what I just heard.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.142
The Final Five, Cavil, they are
near! This is far too important.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.061
What their eyes must have
seen, witnessed over time.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.270
Do they look
anything like us?

09:23.355 --> 09:24.813
That's enough!

09:24.898 --> 09:25.898
Don't you realize
what you're doing?

09:25.982 --> 09:29.068
You're openly
discussing the Final Five.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.031
That's forbidden!

09:36.910 --> 09:39.245
You're toying
with our survival.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.288
Look at yourselves.

09:41.373 --> 09:44.250
Look, there's millions of
Twos who have that nose.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.502
Millions of Sixes
possess that mouth.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.755
Eights share those breasts
and Ones have this brain.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.966
We're mechanized copies.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.469
There's a reason the original
programmers clearly felt

09:55.553 --> 09:57.930
that it's a mistake for us
to contact the Final Five!

09:58.014 --> 09:59.056
No.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.309
Violating that programming
threatens our survival!

10:02.477 --> 10:04.353
Something has changed.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.313
Thoughts have changed.
Yes, they change.

10:06.398 --> 10:10.317
The Raiders changed. That's
where all this started, with them.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.569
Somehow they exceeded
their programming,

10:12.654 --> 10:14.905
and unlike us,
they can't correct themselves.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.782
So we're gonna
have to do it for them.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.158
Do what?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.786
We'll reconfigure
their neural architecture,

10:20.870 --> 10:23.706
and shave down
their heuristic responses.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.125
Dumb them down?
Lobotomize them?

10:26.209 --> 10:28.127
They're tools, not pets.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.963
But in any case,
it has to be done.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.131
Says who?

10:32.215 --> 10:35.884
Says God almighty, the
voice of reason, that's who!

10:36.303 --> 10:38.387
When are you gonna hear it?

10:38.722 --> 10:43.058
You don't have the authority to make
any change without a majority vote.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.312
Well, we'll vote. The Fours
and Fives will be on my side.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.315
There will be a vote. The
Raiders hear what we hear.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.650
The Raiders
are simple machines.

10:51.735 --> 10:52.776
No.

10:52.861 --> 10:56.322
Something extraordinary has
happened. Something is calling to us.

10:56.406 --> 11:00.451
Pushing us to discover our origins, to
understand our place in the universe.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.370
The Raiders are part of
that, and the Final Five...

11:03.455 --> 11:05.998
Are anywhere
but with the humans.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.091
You're late.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.595
I had to wait for
Cally to nod off, okay?

11:19.679 --> 11:20.846
She's having
trouble sleeping.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.181
Did you see Kara?
TIGH: I saw her.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.016
She's crazy
as a latrine rat.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.310
If anything, she's more
like Starbuck than ever.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.353
SAM: She's my wife.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.897
And the President nearly
put a bullet in her skull

11:29.981 --> 11:32.316
because she suspected
her of being a Cylon.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.817
You are one!

11:34.569 --> 11:37.654
We bring attention to
ourselves, we're frakked!

11:38.281 --> 11:42.117
If Starbuck is one of us, she's
playing it big the other way.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.662
The four of us heard the music
and sought each other out.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.165
She hasn't.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.001
We're still missing one.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.713
TYROL: Baltar.

11:56.466 --> 12:01.804
Not Baltar, but when I found him
in the temple on the Algae Planet,

12:02.389 --> 12:05.724
he was with one of those skin
jobs. The one they call D'Anna.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.559
She saw something in there,
I don't know what it is.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.269
But they talked.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.313
He might know something.

12:11.815 --> 12:16.485
He's got those one-god nut cases
believing he's some kind of healer.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.154
He brought some
boy out from a coma.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.574
Maybe he knows
who the fifth is.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.119
Yeah, maybe he knows
who we are.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.996
Then we gotta
get in close and find out.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.417
How do you propose
we do that?

12:31.543 --> 12:33.502
Take him out for drinks?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.171
Well, he is accomplished
at two things.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.966
Lying in his cell,
and lying in a woman.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.634
He'd poke a skin job.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.053
He racked up a Six,
that's a given.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.763
There is no way.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.225
You don't have to get on
your back for him, but...

12:48.309 --> 12:49.893
Oh, gee, thanks.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.370
What were you doing?

13:08.872 --> 13:10.747
What were you thinking?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.709
What happened to you?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.879
I saw Earth.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.967
The shape of it,
the smell of it,

13:22.051 --> 13:24.636
the feel of it on
my skin in my pores.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.140
And I swear to you, it was
like I'd been there before.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.144
Like I never left.

13:36.816 --> 13:41.403
You're too stupid to figure out you
just screwed over the one ally you had.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.239
You didn't have
the guts to hold on.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.704
Tell me,
who's gonna help you?

13:57.253 --> 13:59.046
Yeah, frak me, huh?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.424
It sure as hell
isn't gonna be you.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.596
You've gotta remind yourself
that you're somebody else.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.183
You're the President's
wet nurse.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.731
You're the one who
doesn't have the guts.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.240
Nice to know you
still care, Admiral.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.956
(LAUGHING)

14:43.883 --> 14:46.301
We're going the wrong way!

14:52.141 --> 14:55.978
CAVIL: We have all conferred with
our models, and the results are in.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.606
The Fours and the Fives
have joined us Ones,

14:59.983 --> 15:01.984
and voted to
reconfigure the Raiders.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.902
Gee, what a surprise.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.655
Well, the Twos, Sixes and
Eights voted against it,

15:06.739 --> 15:08.282
so we're deadlocked.

15:08.366 --> 15:11.034
Hopelessly,
but you were right.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.371
And I'm machine enough
to admit that I was wrong.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.123
What are you talking about?

15:16.207 --> 15:19.501
Something extraordinary
has happened.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.211
Eight.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.674
What's going on?

15:31.514 --> 15:32.723
Boomer.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.893
CAVIL: I'm not going to sugarcoat this.

15:36.978 --> 15:41.940
So, I'll just say that this
Eight has voted to reconfigure.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.150
What?
CAVIL: Shocked?

15:43.234 --> 15:44.526
I was shocked, too.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.616
But no one has ever
voted against their model.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.201
No one. Is this true?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.454
We have to be able
to defend ourselves.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.581
No, this is unconscionable.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.708
This is wrong. She can't.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.752
You had something to do with this.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.379
No, it was her
decision totally.

16:04.881 --> 16:05.881
You cannot allow this.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.591
There is no law.
There's no edict.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.135
There's nothing
that forbids it.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.637
It's just never
happened before.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.557
Yeah, try and remember you said
that when he boxes your line.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.100
Now, don't be a sore loser.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.686
If you do this,
we all lose.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.021
We think
it's for the best.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.191
The best?
Have you lost your mind?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.902
Our identities are
determined by our models.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.780
Each model is unique.
We belong together.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.158
You know this
better than anyone.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.662
"Mechanized copies. "
Those are your very words.

16:36.746 --> 16:40.666
"Something has changed. "
Those are your very words.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.501
And I wholeheartedly agree.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.295
The Raiders are sentient,
just as we are.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.256
There was a plan, a
divine plan in our design.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.633
You're butchering them.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.343
We're reconfiguring them.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.845
You are not God.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.013
No.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.015
I'm a mechanic.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.976
The Raiders were designed
to do a specific job.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.771
They stopped doing it.
I'm fixing that.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.525
And when the cutting's all done,
they'll go back to being happy warriors.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.777
So let's move on,
all right?

17:16.119 --> 17:19.371
I'll pray for you.
I'll pray hard.

Say what?
Excuse me.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.191
You're spying on me, Tory.
I've seen you here.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.404
No, no. I heard
about the miracle.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.491
BALTAR: The child?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.659
TORY: Yes.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.496
You mean Laura Roslin
has heard about it.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.875
All right, I have been spying on you.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.377
Well, it's lucky I was
sitting down, isn't it?

20:56.005 --> 21:00.258
I've been watching these
people. The way they look at you.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.969
Of course, if you go
screaming to the President

21:03.054 --> 21:05.263
that my newfound popularity
borders on the phenomenal,

21:05.348 --> 21:07.057
then she should
be very worried.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.600
I came here on my own.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.769
And I slept with
your boss last night.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my giddy aunt.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.027
Get a grip, Gaius.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.362
If she's not lying,

21:20.446 --> 21:23.031
she really could be a
wonderful source of information.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.449
Why don't you
feel her out?

21:24.533 --> 21:25.617
Feel her what?

21:25.701 --> 21:26.701
What?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.203
I'm not talking to you,
actually.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.206
Try and forget
me for a moment.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.291
Ask her what
she's doing here.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.794
I am talking to you.
Why did you come here?

21:35.878 --> 21:37.837
Maybe it was a mistake.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.300
Well, I can't stop thinking
about what's happened.

21:42.385 --> 21:46.179
You were found innocent when
everyone hated you. I hated you.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.474
And this healed boy,
the return of Kara Thrace.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.227

thought she was dead.

there are miracles.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.356
Perhaps.

to be at the center of them.

Yes, I do, don't I?

22:05.074 --> 22:07.951
I don't understand myself,
to be honest. Just...

22:08.869 --> 22:15.667
Well, it seems that God has
chosen me to sing his song.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.127
A song?

22:17.211 --> 22:18.586
Music.
Did you say music?

22:18.879 --> 22:20.130
No.
Yeah, you know, it's funny.

22:20.214 --> 22:21.339
It's a lot like that.

22:21.424 --> 22:26.720
It's like the distant chaos
of an orchestra tuning up.

22:27.722 --> 22:30.932
And then somebody
waves a magic wand,

22:31.851 --> 22:35.937
and all of those notes
start to slide into place.

A grotesque, screeching
cacophony becomes a single melody.

shouldn't be seen here.

Obviously you're me, so...

23:10.848 --> 23:14.184
Is it you, Six?
In disguise?

23:15.311 --> 23:18.229
Now, why would she need to
disguise herself from you?

23:18.314 --> 23:19.773
Well, you've got
a very good point.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.524
Let's talk about Tory.
Where is she?

23:21.609 --> 23:23.068
Shall we talk about Tory?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.737
'Cause we both know
where this is heading.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.864
You like her, don't you?

23:27.948 --> 23:31.409
Yeah, well, you know, she's a sexy lady.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.079
Yeah, yeah.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.373
You slay me.
You really do, Gaius.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.500
Why?

She's more than all these
things. She's special.

And you feel it.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.218
Fragile.
Fragile.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.930
Yeah, I sense that, too.
You're very observant. Fragile.

Follow her into an ambush?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.558
She is driven.
Yeah.

24:40.354 --> 24:44.065
You gonna keep waltzing, or
are you gonna sit down and talk?

24:45.025 --> 24:46.860
What's going on? Sit.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.834
What if she's
telling the truth?

25:05.004 --> 25:07.422
She was supposed
to die out there.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.757
She didn't.
I can't explain it.

25:11.093 --> 25:16.014
What if she was meant to
help us? And this was a...

25:18.642 --> 25:21.769
A what? A miracle?

25:26.066 --> 25:29.444
Is that what you want to
call this? Go ahead, say it.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.279
Grab your piece
of the golden arrow.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.825
I want to hear Admiral atheist
say that a miracle happened.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.246
You shot at her and
you missed at close range.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.791
Doloxan fraks
with your aim.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.252
So does doubt.

25:51.634 --> 25:54.385
I pulled the trigger
and I'd do it again.

25:54.470 --> 25:58.223
She put her life in front of a
bullet as if it had no meaning.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.975
You drop an egg,
you reach for another.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.480
Maybe convincing you meant
more to her than her own life.

26:05.814 --> 26:09.651
Is that your miracle? You
want to talk about miracles?

26:10.444 --> 26:12.278
On the very same day

26:12.446 --> 26:17.242
that a very pale doctor informed
me that I had terminal cancer,

26:17.493 --> 26:20.912
most of humanity was
annihilated, and I survived.

26:21.247 --> 26:25.083
And by some mathematical
absurdity, I became President.

26:25.584 --> 26:29.128
And then
my cancer disappeared.

26:29.213 --> 26:32.799
Long enough for us
to find a way to Earth.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.010
You can call it
whatever you want.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.681
And now I'm dying.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.935
Don't talk that way.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.605
Bill, you gotta face this.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.525
My life is coming
to an end soon enough.

26:50.609 --> 26:54.279
And I am not going to apologize
to you for not trusting her.

26:54.363 --> 26:59.325
And I am not, I am not going to
trust her with the fate of this fleet.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.954
You are so buckled up inside.

27:04.373 --> 27:09.002

son's leaving, this, me. I know it.

No one's going anywhere.

27:16.719 --> 27:17.885
Okay.

27:19.221 --> 27:22.181
Here's the truth.
This is what's going on.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.435
You want to believe Kara.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.188
You would rather
be wrong about her

27:29.273 --> 27:34.569
and face your own demise
than risk losing her again.

27:38.574 --> 27:43.411
You can stay in the room,
but get out of my head.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.131
You're so afraid
to live alone.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.428
And you're afraid
to die that way.

28:03.223 --> 28:07.602
You're afraid that you may not be
the dying leader you thought you were.

28:12.024 --> 28:16.819
Or that your death may be as
meaningless as everyone else's.

You're Zarek's wingman.

29:09.498 --> 29:13.209
All right, all right, you know, stow
it, okay? I've heard it all before.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.796

head's as big as the house I grew up in.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
(SCOFFS)

29:18.173 --> 29:21.342
I'm pretty new to all
this. I could use the help.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.180
Besides, I never really
could say no to anything.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.183
Except me.

29:30.853 --> 29:32.353
Especially you.

29:35.774 --> 29:40.445
You know, I think I finally understand
what you meant about having a destiny.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.948
I've got to do this.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.578
And the fact that I don't have
an explanation why doesn't...

29:49.538 --> 29:52.123
Doesn't really
seem to matter anymore.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.337
So say we all.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.470
So say we all.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.804
(SIGHS)

30:14.229 --> 30:16.814
Good luck on your
journey, Lee Adama.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.906
You, too, Kara Thrace.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.411
Okay.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.537
All right.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.669
Lee.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.282
I believe you.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.832
APOLLO: Red and blue sections will go
first, yellow and green will follow.

31:16.917 --> 31:17.917
Skid's up in 10 minutes.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.710
Starbuck, if you've got a
problem, I don't want to hear it.

31:19.795 --> 31:23.047
STARBUCK: My only problem is that you
didn't preach that sermon a week ago.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.507
APOLLO: Keep your ears open.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.842
Any Cylon contact has
shut down and bugged out.

31:26.927 --> 31:27.885
Questions?

31:27.970 --> 31:30.054
MAN: Yeah, when are you
coming back to the card game?

31:30.138 --> 31:31.514
APOLLO: We're on
tomorrow night!

31:31.598 --> 31:33.307
Hey, all right, all right.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.645
Good luck.
And be careful out there.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.694
HELO: Attention to orders!

31:53.704 --> 31:57.331
TIGH: In recognition of honorable,
loyal and faithful service,

31:58.208 --> 32:01.502
Madam President, Admiral
of the Colonial Fleet,

32:02.170 --> 32:04.839
ladies and gentlemen,
Major Lee Adama.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.424
Salute!

32:32.951 --> 32:34.201
(ALL CHEERING)

32:46.298 --> 32:48.174
Good luck.
Thank you.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.259
Thank you.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.432
Well, it looks like
you got the house.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.563
I'll miss you.

33:44.648 --> 33:45.690
Goodbye, Lee.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.610
Look after yourself.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.356
We want you to stop
lobotomizing the Raiders, Cavil.

34:29.401 --> 34:33.738
Raiders with free will?
Not going to happen.

34:34.990 --> 34:38.409
Do you know what just
really rankles my ass?

34:38.493 --> 34:40.077
You've been pointing fingers,

34:40.162 --> 34:43.539
falsely accusing me of
manipulation just short of tyranny,

34:43.623 --> 34:46.333
when you're the one that's
been leading the charge here.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.127
We want you to stop.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.838
You're not in charge.
We had a vote.

34:52.924 --> 34:57.511
For the last time, will you
stop lobotomizing the Raiders?

34:58.221 --> 35:01.182
(SCOFFS) It's unbelievable,
isn't it? Unbelievable.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.684
For the last time,

35:05.854 --> 35:06.896
no.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.858
I was afraid
you'd say that.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.361
Come in.

35:20.702 --> 35:24.038
This is cute.
Centurions can't vote, Six.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.707
Oh, they're not
here to vote, Cavil.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.402
(MOANING)

36:05.413 --> 36:07.414
Am I hurting you?
No.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.751
What's wrong?
Nothing.

36:13.547 --> 36:16.257
What do you mean nothing?
You're crying.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.803
It's just something
I do during sex.

36:24.558 --> 36:26.433
All the time?
Yeah.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.103
I'm really sorry.

36:30.105 --> 36:33.107
Don't be sorry.
Why should you apologize?

36:35.485 --> 36:37.444
You should be thankful.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.448
You have an abundance
of feeling.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.870
I've never really
thought of it like that.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.205
Well, I mean, you're
blessed, aren't you?

36:48.290 --> 36:51.667
I don't know. I guess.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.797
I suppose I could be a Cylon.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.638
Well, I don't know about that.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.561
Human beings don't exclusively
hold the patent on suffering.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.314
Cylons can feel.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.398
You believe that?

37:14.482 --> 37:16.066
Yeah, I do, actually.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.319
I've spent time amongst them.

37:22.782 --> 37:27.369
Man may have made them, but God's at
the beginning of the string, isn't he?

37:30.248 --> 37:33.667
It's God who imbued them
with a soul. The one true God.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.336
One God?

37:37.047 --> 37:38.672
The one true God.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.802
You know, I'm becoming increasingly
tired of holding that in.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.847
Of denying
that essential truth.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.526
Now, this,
this isn't funny.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.658
Leave.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.119
I said leave!

38:18.713 --> 38:20.506
Why don't they leave?

38:24.678 --> 38:29.264
The telencephalic inhibitor that restricts
higher functions in the Centurions?

38:29.349 --> 38:30.307
We had them removed.

38:30.392 --> 38:31.475
Say what?

38:31.559 --> 38:33.185
You dumbed down the Raiders.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.814
We the Leobens, the Sharons, gave
the Centurions the gift of reason.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.608
You have no authority to do this. None.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.069
You can't do anything without a vote!

38:42.153 --> 38:45.906
No, we can't do anything with
one, so we're finished voting.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.791
What have you done?

38:55.875 --> 38:58.585
First thing they learned is what
you were doing to the Raiders.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.921
You can imagine how they felt.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.299
Oh, no.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.210
GAETA: Sir, the Fleet is
prepped and ready for jump.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.795
ADAMA: Execute jump.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.136
Go back!

39:51.097 --> 39:52.473
Go back.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.146
(SOBBING)

40:30.428 --> 40:31.678
Cuff her.

40:52.534 --> 40:53.575
So.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.913
You quietly cut me loose in deep space?

41:00.375 --> 41:02.167
I'm not afraid to die.

41:02.252 --> 41:05.379
Little easier after you've
been through it once.

41:06.256 --> 41:07.464
Harder.

41:08.007 --> 41:11.176
Especially now that I'm
seeing things so clearly.

41:12.262 --> 41:14.221
You're making a mistake.

41:14.389 --> 41:15.764
Maybe I am.

41:17.267 --> 41:21.895
But I can't take the chance that you're
right and not do something about it.

41:37.078 --> 41:40.581
Helo hand-picked a crew for
you. I'm giving you a ship.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.293
I hope you can
stand the smell.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.920
We liberated
the Demetrius.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.756
It's a sewage
recycling ship.

41:51.176 --> 41:56.054
The party line will be that we're going
for a scouting mission, looking for food.

41:56.931 --> 41:58.849
So you think I'm right.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.101
Maybe. Maybe not.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.646
But I know she is,
the President.

42:05.106 --> 42:08.650
She's been right all
along. I'm tired of losing.

42:10.403 --> 42:13.530
I'm tired of turning away from the
things that I want to believe in.

42:13.615 --> 42:17.993
And I believe you when you say that
you'll die before you stop trying.

42:19.621 --> 42:21.747
And I won't lose you again.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.209
Now go.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.587
Find a way to Earth.
