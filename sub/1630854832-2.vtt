WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.086
- Morning. One for you.
- Oh! Thank you.

00:03.086 --> 00:04.421
One for me.

00:04.421 --> 00:06.381
That is
a very large coffee.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.049
It's actually 13 shots
of espresso.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.551
It's been rough.

00:09.551 --> 00:12.303
I'm having a hard time
not bringing work home with me.

00:12.303 --> 00:15.056
Have you had your
carbon monoxide monitor checked?

00:15.056 --> 00:17.517
- I smell gas.
- Yeah?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.144
You afraid you're
gonna die more?

00:19.144 --> 00:21.438
And what do you know
about robotics?

00:21.438 --> 00:23.440
Fun fact-- the word "robot"

00:23.440 --> 00:25.525
comes from the Czech word
"robota,"

00:25.525 --> 00:27.944
which means forced labor.

00:27.944 --> 00:31.281
At least one of us doesn't have
to worry about heart disease.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.116
For now.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.330
I just don't think writing
obituaries is good for my head.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.832
Ugh, I totally get it.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.542
- Yeah.
- No, I don't. I'm sorry.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.918
I love my job.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.545
Oh, don't be sorry that
you're the lifestyle editor

00:45.545 --> 00:47.172
and you have
this massive office

00:47.172 --> 00:48.757
with light and oxygen
and dignity.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.968
Also be glad you don't have
the weird intern

00:51.968 --> 00:55.013
just following you around,
glaring at you.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.681
Oh, yeah, Mason.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.849
Thinks he's better
than everyone

00:57.849 --> 00:59.184
just because
he went to Dartmouth.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.643
Pretty confident
for a guy

01:00.643 --> 01:02.729
that gets dropped off by his mom
every morning.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.690
His generation never got
bullied in high school.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.359
- They're invincible.
- Mm.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.960
Hey. Hi. I'm--

01:25.960 --> 01:27.962
The other intern who
I will delight in defeating.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.048
Um, okay.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.508
Um, but I'm not an intern.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.301
Then why'd they
give you my office?

01:33.301 --> 01:35.595
- The storage closet?
- Yes, intern.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.889
Must be because you're like
25 years older than me

01:37.889 --> 01:39.307
and they felt bad for you.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.975
You do know I get paid
to work here.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.686
Doesn't mean
you can steal my closet.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.814
The battle of the interns
is on.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.148
Only one can survive.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.609
Again, I'm not a--
Oh. Mnh.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.319
Never mind.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.329
I wish I loved anything

02:01.329 --> 02:02.956
as much as Tina loves salads.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.290
You have two children.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.126
- Yeeeeahhhhh.
- Mm.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.587
Stop the presses!

02:09.587 --> 02:11.047
Does she know that's not
a real thing anymore?

02:11.047 --> 02:12.590
When she says that, it usually
means that her dad has called

02:12.590 --> 02:14.551
and the numbers aren't good.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.052
I just got off the phone
with my father,

02:16.052 --> 02:17.721
and the numbers for the paper

02:17.721 --> 02:19.305
- are not good.
- Yeah.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.474
That is creepy you speak Lexi.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.101
Readership is down.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.936
We need to find a way
to get eyeballs on us.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.980
We need that
clickety clickety buzz buzz.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.314
- Mm?
- Topical stories

02:28.314 --> 02:29.816
- that are socially relevant.
- Ah.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.484
You!
You're young.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.236
What drugs are you on?
We could write about that.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.989
Claritin and an asthma inhaler,
as needed.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.782
Yeah, well, that's going
to change, okay?

02:37.782 --> 02:38.992
We'll do an exposé.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.285
We're gonna enroll you
at Euphoria High School.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.745
Somebody wire this kid up!

02:41.745 --> 02:43.329
Lexi, Lexi, babe, remember,

02:43.329 --> 02:45.498
Euphoria High School
is not a real high school.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.125
Oh, right.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.252
Thank you.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.838
The point is
we need better news, okay?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.673
And good stories
can come from anywhere.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.550
Tina, leave the salad alone!

02:55.550 --> 02:57.510
Come on,
who's got something?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.012
Please don't look at me.
Into the shadows.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.263
I'd like a chance to pitch.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.931
Oh, no.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.224
I need young and relatable.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.769
You write about old and dead.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.479
Ouch.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.897
Unless that translates
to something else?

03:08.897 --> 03:09.981
It doesn't.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.066
- Ouch.
- Mm.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.861
Knock, knock.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.613
Wow.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.240
- Huh?
- This is still depressing.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.409
So you want to tell Lexi I can
do more than write obituaries

03:21.409 --> 03:22.660
and end my nightmare?

03:22.660 --> 03:25.455
Girl, you know I would
if I could, but I can't.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.249
But cheer up-- I have a little
something special for you.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.710
A better smell
for my office?

03:30.710 --> 03:33.171
- No, that's in the walls.
- Yeah.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.048
I have your next assignment.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.676
Motivational speaker
Jane Marvel

03:37.676 --> 03:40.428
from her series
<i>Unleashing Your Inner Tiger.</i>

03:40.428 --> 03:42.639
This helped me
come out to my dad.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.683
- Mm.
- Although, I think I got

03:44.683 --> 03:45.975
some of the jargon wrong

03:45.975 --> 03:48.395
because he thought
I was joining the Marines.

03:49.813 --> 03:53.400
Anyway... happy obit writing.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.361
"Elevate your confidence
and become a majestic tiger

03:56.361 --> 03:59.072
in 36 powerful steps."

03:59.739 --> 04:01.491
Jane Marvel.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.867
- Hello, tiger.
- Oh.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.912
Who's ready to get
the success they want

04:05.912 --> 04:09.040
and want
the success they get?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.918
Oh, boy. M-kay.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.420
So, what are you?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.296
Are you
my spiritual advisor?

04:15.296 --> 04:16.464
- Hasta mañana, Becky.
- Okay.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.590
Are you an angel?

04:17.590 --> 04:18.758
Keep it real, Vernon.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.011
- Maybe I'm the angel?
- That makes more sense.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.303
Good luck with that MRI, Serena.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.680
Thank you.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.056
Nope, I've had it
with you ghosts.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.475
- You are not coming with me.
- Ghost?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.103
- Oh.
- Oh, whoa, well...

04:30.103 --> 04:31.771
that's a perk.

04:31.771 --> 04:32.897
Oh! What's next?

04:32.897 --> 04:35.275
Look, lady, this is how
this is gonna go.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
You'll follow me around,
annoying me for a day or two,

04:37.277 --> 04:38.862
until I write
your obituary.

04:38.862 --> 04:39.946
They'll print it in
the back of the paper

04:39.946 --> 04:41.740
- where no one will read it.
- Oh.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.491
I'll have a mild panic attack
about my life,

04:43.491 --> 04:45.035
- and then you'll move on.
- I've been in weirder spots.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.369
Luckily for me,

04:46.369 --> 04:48.288
I've recently made a friend
who owns a wine bar.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.789
So I'm going to go there,

04:49.789 --> 04:52.250
start at Chardonnay
and work my way to Zinfandel.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.626
Oh.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.714
- There you go.
- Cricket, I love your place.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.883
- Aww!
- It's beautiful.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.802
It's got you,
it's got ambience,

05:02.802 --> 05:03.928
it's got alcohol.

05:03.928 --> 05:07.390
You know, Monty and I met
wine tasting in Spain.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.142
- Mmm.
- We always dreamed

05:09.142 --> 05:11.311
- of opening our own place.
- Mm.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.980
We did, he died,
and here I am.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.690
How are you holding up?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.192
- I'm all right.
- Yeah?

05:17.192 --> 05:21.571
All of our customers
have been so kind and loving.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.822
That's sweet.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.657
Girl, it is getting
on my nerves.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.242
- What?
- No, I--

05:26.242 --> 05:28.244
I appreciate
the sympathy, I do,

05:28.244 --> 05:30.997
but I just wish people
would stop tiptoeing around me,

05:30.997 --> 05:33.208
you know, and just be real.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.793
I can't believe
you did that--

05:34.793 --> 05:36.753
Thank you all so much
for coming.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.213
- Ohh.
- Oh, we're very sorry

05:38.213 --> 05:39.381
for your loss.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.133
Just know that grief
comes in waves.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.765
Oh, damn it, Nell.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.016
Not you, too.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.559
It's a lovely metaphor.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.396
- Grief is like the sea.
- Enh.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.856
- Whatever, Cricket.
- Enh.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.616
Rise and shine!

06:06.616 --> 06:07.992
Oh!

06:07.992 --> 06:09.411
- God!
- Oh!

06:09.411 --> 06:12.247
Before I am sent
to that jungle in the sky,

06:12.247 --> 06:15.291
I have decided to make you
my last disciple.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.960
No, thanks, I'm good.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.753
We did not get up
to give up.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.672
Your work habitat
was pretty bleak,

06:20.672 --> 06:22.924
so I'm hoping
your home life is better.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.677
Oh, yes!
Peloton. Ha ha!

06:25.677 --> 06:29.681
Do not underestimate the power
of exercise in the jungle.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.393
Do you know that the panther
travels 20 miles per day

06:33.393 --> 06:34.561
doing a zig-zag pattern?

06:34.561 --> 06:37.147
- Do panthers eat Froot Loops?
- Uh, hmm.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.398
Morning, Nell.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.567
Good, you're married.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.068
We can skip ahead
to disc three.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.946
Reminder, we made a deal
that you were gonna walk Arthur

06:44.946 --> 06:46.406
by 8:00 a.m.
if you're gonna live here.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.284
An adult roommate.
That tracks.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.493
I'm glad you
brought up the rules.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.828
I'd like to make
an amendment

06:51.828 --> 06:53.872
to move the Peloton
out of the dining area

06:53.872 --> 06:55.874
so that we can do
a proper kitchen table.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.043
Why? There's plenty of places
you could eat--

06:58.043 --> 06:59.711
in your bedroom,
or you could eat on the couch

06:59.711 --> 07:01.671
if you put a blanket down.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.298
You could even eat in the
bathroom if you're a monster.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.342
Or the breakfast bar
if it wasn't so covered

07:05.342 --> 07:06.551
in your weird little piles.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.887
No, these are important
legal briefs, okay?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.096
I'm working on a case.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.639
Don't put the bowl
on the handles, please.

07:11.639 --> 07:12.891
My job is important, too,

07:12.891 --> 07:15.143
but you don't see me hogging up
all the eating area.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.520
Really? Are you trying to
block construction

07:17.520 --> 07:19.606
of a minor league baseball
stadium on a marsh that's home

07:19.606 --> 07:22.192
to the endangered southwestern
willow flycatcher,

07:22.192 --> 07:24.986
which controls insect population
around waterways and wetlands?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.821
I could if I wanted to.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.323
Nell, I'm trying to save
something that's alive--

07:28.323 --> 07:30.033
I'm not writing book reports
about dead people.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.203
- All right, have a nice day.
- Mm-hmm.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.206
Are you really gonna let that
tall piece of broccoli

07:36.206 --> 07:37.415
walk all over you like that?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.000
I'm not letting him
walk all over me.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.085
He's on the spectrum,

07:40.085 --> 07:41.252
and honesty
is part of his personality.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.712
Mm.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.547
I watched a TikTok about it.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.301
- Hey!
- Hey!

07:48.301 --> 07:49.886
I got us salads, huh?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.680
I thought we could have lunch
in your luxurious office.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.306
I really wish I could,

07:53.306 --> 07:55.475
but Lexi scheduled a pitch
meeting with all the editors,

07:55.475 --> 07:57.102
and she had
some lobster flown in.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.563
She thinks that expensive food
will really motivate people.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.023
And it does.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.775
But I'll sneak you
some lobster, okay?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.903
Euphoria Kid!
You're coming, too!

08:06.903 --> 08:09.239
- A nickname already.
- Oh!

08:09.239 --> 08:10.949
Oh, Sam, these pants
are fabulous.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.826
- Come in!
- The intern is going?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.494
But he's just an intern!

08:15.537 --> 08:17.956
Looks like
you're stuck in the bullpen

08:17.956 --> 08:20.166
with the salad eaters.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.045
Ugh. Can't believe Mason
got invited.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.422
Cheers, everybody!

08:25.422 --> 08:26.631
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

08:26.631 --> 08:29.134
When I started at the paper,
I had so much momentum.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.095
God, if I hadn't moved
to London with Phillip,

08:32.095 --> 08:34.347
I could've
been in there, too.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.934
I'll say to you what I said
to Dermot Mulroney--

08:37.934 --> 08:39.644
doesn't matter
that you could've

08:39.644 --> 08:40.812
'cause you didn't.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.189
Dermot and I are on
different paths.

08:43.189 --> 08:46.735
Oh, I-- I--

08:48.236 --> 08:49.362
Oh, God.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.114
And by the way,
I'm getting really tired

08:51.114 --> 08:52.490
of listening
to dead people.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.117
Then do something about it.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.910
Oh, come on,
you heard Lexi,

08:55.910 --> 08:57.454
she isn't interested
in my ideas.

08:59.247 --> 09:03.001
Do you think that the tiger
just waits for a chubby baby

09:03.001 --> 09:05.420
to come wandering
into the jungle?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.088
No! Of course not.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.090
It saunters
into the villages,

09:09.090 --> 09:11.384
and it snatches one
from the mother's teat!

09:13.136 --> 09:14.137
Well...

09:14.137 --> 09:16.681
You know...

09:17.474 --> 09:19.434
When I heard about the case
that Edward was working on

09:19.434 --> 09:22.270
about saving
the southwestern flycatcher,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.606
I immediately thought that
it would make a great feature.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.941
Yeah.
Write the article.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.735
It's a win-win-win.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.488
You get a new job,
I get my last triumph,

09:31.488 --> 09:33.865
and you don't have to
hang out with ghosts anymore.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.789
Screw it.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.583
Jane, make me a tiger.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.628
Okay, this will be good.

09:46.628 --> 09:47.712
You know, it's been a while

09:47.712 --> 09:49.464
since I've done
some meaningful writing.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.216
I can do this, right?

09:51.216 --> 09:53.176
"I can do this, right?"

09:53.176 --> 09:55.470
If I wasn't a ghost,
I'd smack you across the face.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.554
Mm.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.014
You just need a boost.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.724
- Hit "play."
- Okay.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.895
<i>The jungle--
nature's proving ground.</i>

10:03.895 --> 10:05.397
<i>Kill or be killed.</i>

10:05.397 --> 10:07.524
<i>What is your jungle?</i>

10:07.524 --> 10:09.150
<i>Could it be your office?</i>

10:09.150 --> 10:10.235
<i>Your bedroom?</i>

10:10.235 --> 10:11.444
<i>- Your church?</i>
- Okay, wait.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.196
How-- How long is this?

10:13.196 --> 10:16.700
17 1/2 mind-blowing hours.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.867
I don't have time for this.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.411
I'll just give you
the broad strokes.

10:19.411 --> 10:23.206
Step one--
Dreams are just wishes.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.667
Set a goal
and do the work.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.252
Step eight--

10:27.252 --> 10:30.505
A no is just a yes
that doesn't know it yet.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.424
Councilman,
I'll ask again--

10:32.424 --> 10:33.758
how much
of the city's tax credit

10:33.758 --> 10:35.885
is going to fund
the stadium?

10:37.595 --> 10:38.680
Ugh!

10:38.680 --> 10:39.806
I can't work like this.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.475
Are we gonna score
some coke?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.935
Oh, I-- I was talking
about my workspace.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.103
Oh!

10:45.103 --> 10:47.355
- Don't move.
- Huh?

10:47.355 --> 10:50.066
Why are there more screws
than holes?

10:52.527 --> 10:56.698
Step 17-- When you feel small,
make yourself big.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.035
Ooh, do you have
any thick maxi pads?

11:00.035 --> 11:01.828
I don't see how
that's even a--

11:01.828 --> 11:03.163
- I knew it.
- Go get them.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.748
Huh?

11:06.082 --> 11:07.751
Congratulations!

11:07.751 --> 11:10.503
You can move on
to disc two.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.633
What's happening?

11:15.633 --> 11:17.761
I'm writing an article
about your case.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.554
Well, the southwestern
willow flycatcher thanks you,

11:19.554 --> 11:21.181
but why the hell
did you move my bike?

11:21.181 --> 11:24.100
Because I live here, too.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.561
And if you can have a stupid
bike that doesn't go anywhere,

11:26.561 --> 11:30.273
I can have a Flurskydur
that I get to eat breakfast on.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.233
It's difficult having
a conversation with you

11:32.233 --> 11:34.194
when you look like three kids
stacked on top of each other

11:34.194 --> 11:36.112
trying to sneak into
an R-rated movie.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.409
You know, disc one Nell would
just take your honesty crap.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.869
Well, now I'm gonna be
honest with you.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.580
You have too many dumb rules
and unreasonable expectations,

11:45.580 --> 11:47.582
and you are super annoying
to live with.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.921
Noted.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.172
Oh.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.258
Well done.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.261
And now it's time
for the final step--

12:00.261 --> 12:04.724
exploit
all your resources.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.562
I mean, this is a very bold
choice for a Wednesday.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.773
I'm trying a thing.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.024
You're trying something.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.068
- Hello!
- Cricket, yes!

12:15.068 --> 12:16.778
I want you to meet
my very best friend, Sam.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.279
Hi.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.572
She helped me get my job
at the paper.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.701
Well, I have to thank you
for bringing Nell into my life.

12:22.701 --> 12:26.871
She wrote the most beautiful
obituary for my husband, Monty.

12:26.871 --> 12:31.209
Oh. I am so sorry
for your loss.

12:31.209 --> 12:35.255
But, remember,
when one door closes,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.298
another window opens.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.800
Oh. Mm.
Thank you for that.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.135
You're so welcome.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.721
- Mm-hmm.
- Empathy is my superpower.

12:42.721 --> 12:43.930
- For sure.
- Yeah.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.474
So, I wrote an exposé

12:46.474 --> 12:47.726
on the corruption
around the ballpark

12:47.726 --> 12:49.102
going into the wetlands,

12:49.102 --> 12:52.564
and it's the best thing
I have ever written.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.940
Uh...

12:53.940 --> 12:55.108
I want you to show Lexi.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.776
- Nell.
- You heard her!

12:56.776 --> 12:59.029
This is the kind
of journalism she wants.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.614
And you guys
are friends, yeah?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.074
You speak her language.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.326
You just got this job
writing obituaries.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.704
Why are you trying to rush off
and do something else?

13:07.704 --> 13:10.749
Two minutes!

13:10.749 --> 13:11.916
That was a two-minute plank.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.960
I really can't explain it.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.588
I just need to do
anything else.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.673
See, I love you,
but it just sounds to me

13:18.673 --> 13:20.550
like you're trying
to skip some steps.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.803
Oh, she doesn't get us.
You gotta cut her loose.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.722
You're right.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.640
No. The article
is no big deal.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.725
Let's drink our lunch.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.727
All right.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.145
We'll find another way.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.358
Hey, Tina, who's in charge
of uploading

13:36.358 --> 13:39.110
the, um, articles
to the paper's website?

13:39.110 --> 13:42.322
Mm.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.993
Wow, that's
a really thick salad.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.411
Thank you.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.288
Everything has to go
through the section editor

13:50.288 --> 13:52.874
who then sends it
to the Internet upload engineer.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.168
I don't think
I've met them yet.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.379
- It's Mason.
- He helped Lexi fix the font

13:57.379 --> 13:58.755
size on her phone this morning,

13:58.755 --> 14:00.548
and now she thinks
he's an I.T. god.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.260
Hey.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.888
Oh, you look oily.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.973
Yeah.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.850
I went a little nuts
on the hot butter yesterday.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.935
Mm.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.353
Really took a toll
on my body.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.939
- My bamboo sheets are ruined.
- Gross.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.190
But seeing the look
on your face

14:17.190 --> 14:18.900
made every clarified sip
worth it.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.362
Actually, that's why I'm here.
I mean, I--

14:22.362 --> 14:24.447
I really want us to stop
competing with each other

14:24.447 --> 14:25.865
and start supporting
each other.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.117
Why?

14:27.117 --> 14:28.284
Cool, we have a deal?
Awesome.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.829
Now, I need you
to upload an article

14:30.829 --> 14:32.497
that Dennis is
too busy to upload,

14:32.497 --> 14:33.915
but he totally
wants uploaded.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.583
And, uh, this feels great.
This feels good.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.668
I'm glad we're friends.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.752
- Clearly you're lying.
- What?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.170
I won't do it.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.338
Unless...

14:40.338 --> 14:42.716
Okay, just say it.
What do you want?

14:42.716 --> 14:43.925
$5,000 and a Miata.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.135
- No!
- My office back.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.219
- Deal.
- Yesss.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.345
Yesss!

14:47.345 --> 14:49.973
Ow!

14:49.973 --> 14:53.059
Oh, it has been a pleasure
making you less pathetic.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.771
Yeah, and if you're the last
dead person that I talk to,

14:56.771 --> 14:57.939
it's been weird.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.941
Aww! I know.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.443
Oh, ka-boom!

15:01.443 --> 15:02.736
- Ooh, yes!
- We did it!

15:02.736 --> 15:04.529
- I'm back, baby!
- Yeah!

15:04.529 --> 15:06.197
- What have you done?
- Huh?

15:06.197 --> 15:08.199
Lexi wants to see us
in her office.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.451
Because she read my article?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.453
And loved it?

15:12.287 --> 15:14.497
And wants to give me
a promotion?

15:14.497 --> 15:16.499
And some lobster?

15:16.499 --> 15:19.961
Mnh. All sales of
<i>Unleash Your Inner Tiger</i>

15:19.961 --> 15:21.463
are final.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.966
Your article
has been taken down.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.427
What you did was
completely egregious.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.804
One mistake,
and we could have been sued.

15:29.804 --> 15:32.182
Also that jacket is gross,

15:32.182 --> 15:33.600
and you smell like
summer rain.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.935
It's my shoulders.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.146
Nell, Nell, Nell.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.939
Do you spell that
with an "N" or a "K-N"?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.316
What is that?

15:41.316 --> 15:42.609
This is my book of chances.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.277
I keep a tally
for each of my employees

15:44.277 --> 15:46.446
and how many chances they have
left before they get fired.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.989
How many do I have?

15:47.989 --> 15:50.241
- Five.
- Ah.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.326
Nell, you had one.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.495
That makes five sound
pretty good.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.788
We'll always be friends.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.081
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:56.081 --> 15:59.292
A few years ago, I moved away
and I screwed up my life.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.754
And I want you to know that
I really appreciate this job,

16:02.754 --> 16:05.465
but since I've been
writing obituaries,

16:05.465 --> 16:08.677
I've been weirdly
stuck in my head

16:08.677 --> 16:10.387
and I haven't done
my best work.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.932
I know I could be more valuable
to this paper

16:13.932 --> 16:16.142
as an investigative journalist.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.310
Hm.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.436
I don't think I follow.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.979
Lexi.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.856
What Nell is saying
is that she thinks

16:21.856 --> 16:23.692
she can give you
the clickety clickety boom,

16:23.692 --> 16:25.110
and if you take away
that last chance,

16:25.110 --> 16:26.444
she won't be able to prove

16:26.444 --> 16:28.697
that she can give you
the zip to the zap-zop.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.826
Now, that I understand.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.703
Why didn't she say that
in the first place?

16:34.703 --> 16:36.830
Sam, you get
eight more chances.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.623
Can I just use one of
those chances

16:38.623 --> 16:40.291
to say that Nell is
a really great writer?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.127
Hm.
Well, she must be.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.295
I've been getting a lot
of e-mails to the editor

16:44.295 --> 16:46.006
praising her obituaries.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.090
- What?
- For some reason, you've really

16:47.090 --> 16:49.551
connected with our readers.

16:49.551 --> 16:52.512
What?
Wait. Really?

16:52.512 --> 16:53.972
Yes. And most of them
say the same thing--

16:53.972 --> 16:55.890
that it really seems like
you actually know

16:55.890 --> 16:57.809
the person
that you've been writing about.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.061
Which is why I need you
to do your job.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.896
Unless, of course,
you don't want it,

17:01.896 --> 17:04.065
and then I can just
go right back here and--

17:04.065 --> 17:05.400
No, no, no, she wants it.
Nell, nod.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.526
- Oh.
- Up and down, there we go.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.194
Let's go, let's go.
Thank you.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.529
Oh, you know what?
Did you ever think about

17:09.529 --> 17:11.656
putting together
a book of praises?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.950
Did you ever think about
making a book of bad ideas?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.201
Oh.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.536
Thank you.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.080
Thanks for saving my ass.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.582
I just-- I--

17:20.582 --> 17:21.750
I can't believe
you were gonna give up

17:21.750 --> 17:23.585
- one of your chances for me.
- Ah!

17:23.585 --> 17:25.503
Are you kidding?
Her kid bit my kid.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.213
So I actually have
unlimited chances.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.215
- Nice!
- I know, right?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.759
I guess I--

17:30.759 --> 17:32.844
I just get so caught up
in what I'm not doing

17:32.844 --> 17:35.722
that I don't realize
I'm doing something... good.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.974
Yeah, you gotta
do that sometimes.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.393
- Yeah. You do.
- I do?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.687
It's like you don't think
you're far enough along,

17:42.687 --> 17:44.189
so you just jump
into something else.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.316
You just did it with this.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.401
And you kinda did it
when you dropped everything

17:48.401 --> 17:49.861
and moved your entire life
for Phillip.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.572
So maybe it's time
to just, like,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.699
be patient
and enjoy where you're at.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.242
Here? This place?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.411
Yes, here in this place,
you know, with me.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.205
Look, I may speak Lexi,

18:00.205 --> 18:02.040
but you know
my first language is Nell.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.544
Love you.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.380
Oh.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.589
You're welcome.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.091
For what?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.258
You almost made me
lose my job.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.845
Or did I make you want
the success you got?

18:15.845 --> 18:16.971
You're exhausting.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.182
Five out
of my six ex-husbands

18:19.182 --> 18:20.934
said the same thing.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.727
I'm genuinely excited
to write about you.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.229
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.855
Let's start with
how you first realized

18:25.855 --> 18:26.940
you had this talent.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.233
Oh, great story.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.902
So, I did one semester
of zoology

18:30.902 --> 18:35.156
at Arizona State and had parents
that withheld love.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.324
Oh.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.162
Hi.

18:41.162 --> 18:43.873
Let me move my Flurskydur.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.755
- Thanks.
- Yep.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.345
I'm sorry I said
you were annoying.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.557
It's fine.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.018
It's better if people are
straightforward with me, anyway.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.270
Oh, my gosh.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.981
My girlfriend says
I'm annoying all the time.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.191
She also says
that obituaries

19:10.191 --> 19:11.776
aren't book reports
for dead people,

19:11.776 --> 19:13.361
because they offer
closure and comfort,

19:13.361 --> 19:17.615
which I never really thought of,
but I guess is true.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.952
Yeah, um, I'm starting
to see that now, too.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.330
I'm gonna clip out.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.582
Okay.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.543
If we're gonna live together,

19:28.543 --> 19:31.296
I think it's best that we work
on our communication a bit.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.797
I'm down with that.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.799
Hopefully it'll help me
better understand

19:34.799 --> 19:36.468
your irrational
and erratic mood swings,

19:36.468 --> 19:38.511
also your obsession
with tables.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.722
You're not gonna let
the table go, are you?

19:40.722 --> 19:42.849
Autistic people
just hate tables now.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.601
- Really?
- No, I'm joking.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.728
I beg you, please,

19:46.728 --> 19:48.480
stop getting all your
information from TikTok.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.984
But it's just--
it's so quick and trendy.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.697
- Hey!
- Hey!

19:57.697 --> 20:01.242
There she is,
my favorite new customer.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.244
Edward, I'd like you
to meet my friend Cricket.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.372
Oh, it is lovely
to meet you.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.748
I heard your husband
passed away.

20:06.748 --> 20:09.417
I literally just told you
not to say anything.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.586
That must suck. You're still
fit. You're young.

20:11.586 --> 20:14.089
You've got a lot of years
left alone.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.132
Well, maybe 20.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.134
Edward!
Cricket, I am so sorry.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.428
No, really, I love it.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.180
Finally some honesty.

20:22.180 --> 20:25.475
Plus, he's right,
I've still got it going on.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.728
But here you are,
very alone.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.314
He's dead. He died.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.440
Yes, it's devastating.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.109
- It's a total waste.
- It is!

20:34.109 --> 20:35.318
You're pathetic, ya old bag.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.363
Nell, the woman
just lost her husband.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.407
- I thought we were doing a--
- Thought what?

20:40.407 --> 20:43.034
Oh, screw you guys.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.537
He died.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.955
- Ah, don't you--
- He did!

20:46.955 --> 20:48.289
You've got a lot of nerve,
you know that?

20:48.289 --> 20:50.041
You know what?

20:50.583 --> 20:54.045
