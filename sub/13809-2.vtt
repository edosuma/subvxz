{\an1}THE GUY CAN'T
KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.974

BUT I LEFT OUT ONE HUGE DETAIL.

10:12.611 --> 10:13.738
REALLY?

10:13.821 --> 10:16.032
I DID THE SAME THING WITH SAM.

{\an5}Sam:
YOU SPILLED THE BEANS
AFTER LAYING THE BLAME ON ME?

11:09.460 --> 11:11.420
{\an1}THAT'S ABOUT

{\an3}OKAY!

11:24.517 --> 11:26.227
LOOK, SQUID, I'M SORRY.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.978
{\an1}HOW CAN I MAKE IT
UP TO YOU?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.563
LET'S JUST GO SURFING...

12:16.152 --> 12:18.446
{\an1}DUDES, WE ARE NOT LOSING
TO THE STICK DEMONS

12:18.529 --> 12:20.322
{\an1}FOR THE THIRD
WINTERFEST IN A ROW.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.992
{\an1}WE CAN WIN
THIS HOCKEY GAME.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.952
{\an1}ALL WE NEED
IS ONE THING.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.121
COLLISION INSURANCE?

12:27.204 --> 12:27.746
NO.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.332
THAT FAMOUS ROCKET TEAMWORK.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.417
(<i> laughs</i> )

12:31.500 --> 12:33.335
ICE HOCKEY?

12:33.419 --> 12:34.336
(<i> laughs</i> )

12:34.420 --> 12:35.713
YOU ACTUALLY LIKE

12:35.796 --> 12:38.466
{\an5}CHASING A PIECE
OF RUBBER AROUND
WITH A STICK?

12:38.549 --> 12:42.011
YOUR COUSIN'S ASKING
FOR IT AGAIN, TWISTER.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.388
OH, AND I GUESS ICE DANCING
IS A REAL SPORT.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.224
ANYONE WITH A TUTU
COULD DO IT.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.977
WELL, I COULD LOOK LIKE
A BIG, DUMB HOCKEY PLAYER

12:50.060 --> 12:51.812
IF YOU KNOCKED
OUT ALL MY TEETH.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.772
{\an1}MAYBE SOMEONE
OUGHT TO DO THAT.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.024
CHILL OUT, REG.

12:55.107 --> 12:55.733
COME ON, REG.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.277
WE GOT TO FOCUS
ON THE BIG GAME.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.613
(<i> growls</i> )

13:09.038 --> 13:11.499
{\an4}YOU KNOW CLIO
AND REGGIE HAVE BEEN
GOING AT IT FOREVER.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.043
{\an1}MIGHT AS WELL
STAY OUT OF IT.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.504
{\an5}I'M FAMILY--
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO BE OUT OF IT.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.588
I WAS WONDERING

13:17.671 --> 13:20.049
JUST HOW HUGE ARE
THESE STICK DEMONS?

13:20.132 --> 13:24.345

13:34.939 --> 13:35.981
BEHOLD!

13:36.065 --> 13:37.107
WINTERFEST.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.027
HEY, MY TOES ARE COLD.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.196
{\an1}FLIP-FLOPS ARE
NOT FOR SNOW, BRO.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.039
IT'S A WINTER FAIRYLAND!

13:52.122 --> 13:55.125
FAIRYLAND?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.377
{\an1}THE THRILLER
IN THE CHILLER.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.421
THE RUMBLE
IN THE TUNDRA.

13:59.505 --> 14:03.342
THE BATTLE... IN THE COLD PLACE!

14:13.477 --> 14:15.729

14:17.940 --> 14:18.983
(<i> grunts</i> )

14:29.827 --> 14:32.621
HEY, CAN YOU AT LEAST WAIT
TILL I GET MY PADS ON?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.457
THAT WAS A TRIPLE SALCHOW.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.836
THE GLORIOUS ICE SPRAY
IS JUST FOR EFFECT.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.714
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME ICE SPRAY.

14:41.797 --> 14:42.298

14:44.550 --> 14:46.969
YEAH, CHILL,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

14:47.052 --> 14:50.389
{\an5}YOUR FRIEND JUST
DOESN'T APPRECIATE
ART, MAURICE?

14:50.472 --> 14:51.515
{\an1}YOUR NAME
IS MAURICE?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.309
{\an1}(<i> laughing</i> ):
EXCELLENT.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.477
DON'T CALL

14:55.561 --> 14:58.439
{\an1}GO GET THE PUCK,
MAURICE.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.274
(<i> moans</i> )

15:04.194 --> 15:07.323
{\an4}ICE SCULPTURE JUST
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
YOUR BAG, BRO.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.450
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SAND AND SURF ONLY.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.743
NO WAY, BROTHER.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.245
SAND SCULPTURE, ICE SCULPTURE,
I DO THEM ALL.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.748
NICE SHOULDER EXTENSION
ON THE HAMMER THING.

15:15.831 --> 15:16.999
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.043
SMALLER ICE BLOCK.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.253
{\an5}Otto:
THEN THIS "X"--
THAT'S YOU, TWIST--

15:21.337 --> 15:24.340
BANKS LEFT, SPINS RIGHT,
PUTS A PASS RIGHT HERE

15:24.423 --> 15:25.424
I CROSS OVER.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.509
WHICH "X" AM I?

15:27.593 --> 15:31.263
THE "X" WITH THE INHALER.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.681
IT'S A GOOD PLAY, ROCKET BOY

15:32.765 --> 15:34.558
BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.517
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.936
IF WE EXECUTE THEN WE WIN

15:38.020 --> 15:39.271
AND THERE'S NO WAY

15:39.355 --> 15:42.149
{\an1}THOSE INCREDIBLE BOLTS
CAN EVER RANK ON US AGAIN.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.692
OH, NOW, THIS IS CUTE!

15:43.776 --> 15:47.112
{\an5}DON'T YOU THINK THIS
IS A SMART LOOK
FOR A HOCKEY TEAM?

15:47.196 --> 15:49.698
SPORTY YET
SOPHISTICATED.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.575
REGGIE?

15:52.826 --> 15:57.206
WELL, CLIO, IT IS A NICE OUTFIT

15:57.289 --> 15:59.875
BUT HOCKEY REALLY ISN'T
ABOUT LOOKING CUTE.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.543
{\an5}(<i> laughs</i> ):
OH, RIGHT, IT'S ABOUT
BLOODY NOSES

16:01.627 --> 16:03.295
AND SMELLING SWEATY, RIGHT?

16:03.379 --> 16:04.880
(<i> sighs</i> )

16:04.963 --> 16:09.009
NO, ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT
TEAMWORK AND SPEED.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.386
YOU DON'T GET IT.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.721
HOCKEY'S <i> NOT</i> FOR GIRLS.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.723
I MEAN, YOUR HAIR
IS ALWAYS A MESS

16:14.807 --> 16:17.851
{\an1}YOU SMELL LIKE
THE INSIDE OF A KNEEPAD.

16:17.935 --> 16:22.648
OH, AND SPINNING AROUND LIKE
SOME WINDUP TOY IS MORE GIRLISH?

16:22.731 --> 16:23.649

JUST MAKE PEACE WITH HER, REG.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.829
{\an5}ALL THIS FIGHTING
KEEPS MESSING UP
OUR HOCKEY PRACTICE.

16:36.912 --> 16:37.538
DO I HAVE TO?

16:37.621 --> 16:40.040
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.542
SHE JUST BUGS ME, OKAY?

16:41.625 --> 16:44.878
SHE BUGS ME, TOO.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.589
{\an5}(<i> imitating Clio</i> ):
YOUR FRIEND REGGIE'S
SUCH A TOMBOY.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.590

16:48.674 --> 16:49.758
EXCUSE ME?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.928
{\an1}COME ON,
ROCKET GIRL, FOCUS.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.430
DO IT FOR THE TEAM.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.268
{\an3}YO, CLIO

16:59.351 --> 17:01.937
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
GOOD LUCK THIS AFTERNOON.

17:02.020 --> 17:02.938
I MEAN IT.

17:03.021 --> 17:04.940

17:05.022 --> 17:06.066
REALLY?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.901
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.653
AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU, TOO.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.988
NOT THAT YOU NEED IT.

17:11.070 --> 17:15.284
{\an1}I MEAN, YOUR EVENT IS
SO MUCH EASIER THAN MINE.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.452
(<i> static</i> )

17:16.535 --> 17:17.786
OH, NO!

17:17.869 --> 17:19.579
MELTDOWN PART 12.

17:19.663 --> 17:20.789
ARE YOU KIDDING?

17:20.873 --> 17:24.417
{\an5}YOU DON'T HAVE TO
AVOID HUMAN ZAMBONIES
WHILE CHASING A PUCK!

17:24.501 --> 17:27.963
{\an4}WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LAND A QUADRUPLE AXLE...
ON ONE BLADE!

17:28.047 --> 17:28.464
REGGIE, CLIO, PLEASE!

17:28.547 --> 17:30.966
YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

17:31.049 --> 17:34.887
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY THAT TOMBOY
COULD EVER SKATE A LONG PROGRAM

17:34.970 --> 17:36.972
TO PACHELBEL'S CANON IN D MINOR.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.640
{\an1}AND YOU ARE JOKING
IF YOU THINK LITTLE MISS TUTU

17:38.724 --> 17:41.435
{\an1}COULD EVER EXECUTE
A "GIVE AND GO."

17:41.518 --> 17:46.482
{\an1}FORGET IT, TWIST,
THEY'LL NEVER GET ALONG.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.609
I COULD SO ICE DANCE.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.652
WELL, I COULD PLAY HOCKEY.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.112
WANT TO BET?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.572
{\an3}SURE.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.493

{\an5}WHEN I CAUGHT SUCH
SERIOUS AIR OFF

UNFORTUNATELY, THE RAMP HAD BEEN
MOVED SEVERAL FEET TO THE LEFT

COULD DO THAT.

OH, THANKS, DAD.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.212

21:37.295 --> 21:40.340
YOU MEAN SLAPSHOT,

21:44.803 --> 21:47.139
MAJOR DOWNAGE--

21:47.222 --> 21:49.558
CLIO GOT "DQed" FROM
THE ICE DANCING COMPETITION.

{\an5}WELL, SINCE IT
WASN'T REALLY CLIO
THAT WAS SKATING...

I DON'T THINK SHE'S
TOO BUMMED ABOUT IT.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.607
{\an4}I MAY TAKE OFF
THE LITTLE HOCKEY
PLAYER AT THE TOP

21:57.691 --> 21:58.817
{\an1}AND MAKE
HIM A PENDANT.

YOU THINK?
