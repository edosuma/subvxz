00:05.631 --> 00:06.716
"It is scientifically proven

00:06.799 --> 00:08.467
that the best cure
for hangover is sex.

00:08.718 --> 00:11.679
Sex is an antidepressant, painkiller,
and an excellent way to workout."

00:14.682 --> 00:15.766
Bárbara?

00:17.768 --> 00:19.687
I dropped the kids off at the party!

00:21.439 --> 00:23.274
Guess what I'm going to do now?

00:24.066 --> 00:27.069
I'm going to fuck you
like never before, so get ready.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.155
Honey?

00:30.448 --> 00:32.616
I have a surprise for you
in my pants,

00:32.700 --> 00:35.494
do you want to see it,
or shall I give it to you...?

00:36.328 --> 00:37.455
Carmen!

00:37.538 --> 00:40.583
Sorry, Carmen.
I was expecting to see my wife...

00:41.375 --> 00:42.793
You rascal!

00:44.211 --> 00:46.714
You should be ashamed, Mr. Cuevas!

00:46.756 --> 00:49.383
- You are unbelievable.
- Stop smiling!

00:50.050 --> 00:52.636
You've been a bad boy.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.681
And do you know
what happens to bad boys?

00:56.223 --> 00:57.641
They are spanked.

00:58.768 --> 01:00.978
Spank me then.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.814
Go to your room, right now.

01:03.898 --> 01:06.692
- Spank me hard.
- Go upstairs.

01:06.776 --> 01:10.070
- Spank me!
- Okay, then!

01:11.614 --> 01:12.948
- Spank me.
- Come on.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.450
But first...

01:15.075 --> 01:17.286
- I want to fuck you.
- No way!

01:17.495 --> 01:20.080
- Let's do a porn video.
- Of course not!

01:20.414 --> 01:23.167
The kids could watch it.
Go to your room.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.752
- Then...
- Go!

01:39.433 --> 01:42.353
HI! I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.521
I NEED TO SEE YOU.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.926
How was your night out
with your friends?

02:14.260 --> 02:15.511
It was cool.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.889
- But I'm exhausted.
- Where did you go?

02:20.266 --> 02:21.475
To a bar.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.814
What's gotten into you?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.817
When are you going
to stop lying to me?

02:37.992 --> 02:39.660
Two tickets to OV7 concert.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.043
What? I went to the concert.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.713
I didn't tell you
because you hate them,

02:50.796 --> 02:55.759
and then you think I'm too old
because I like 90s music. That's it.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.889
You are so right about that.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.476
Can you share your photos
with me so I can post them?

03:11.984 --> 03:13.527
You're not going to send them to me?

03:14.737 --> 03:17.323
Why not? If there's nothing
to hide. Or is there?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.454
Okay. Adriana went with me.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.415
She's an old friend of mine,

03:26.498 --> 03:29.209
and we were huge OV7 fans
since school.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.712
I'm not fucking her, okay?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.882
And we are in an open relationship.

03:35.341 --> 03:38.385
Right, we are
in an open relationship.

03:39.345 --> 03:41.347
But we agreed
not to lie to each other.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.225
And you...

03:46.435 --> 03:47.853
just lied to me.

03:48.604 --> 03:52.858
All because you went to a concert
with your school crush.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.994
THE GAME OF KEYS

04:05.663 --> 04:06.997
GABY, I...

04:12.294 --> 04:13.671
- Dad?
- What?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.047
GABY, YOU ARE SPECIAL

04:15.130 --> 04:16.715
Your eggs are getting burnt.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.260
- What?
- Your eggs!

04:20.803 --> 04:22.388
Okay, okay.

04:24.515 --> 04:28.519
Okay, guys. Listen up.
I need to tell you something.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.858
We're going out of town.
We need to reset.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.069
We're going to Vallarta on vacation.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.780
Right. But we're leaving now.

04:39.863 --> 04:43.200
We pack our things and get going.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.285
Now?

04:46.829 --> 04:49.415
Dad, Mom's acting weird again.
Tell her something.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.333
No, she's right, Mica.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.378
I think it's a great idea. It's cool.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.840
But I have plans.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.092
What kind of plans, honey?

05:00.759 --> 05:03.095
You can play video games every day.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.764
Come on, Mica. Your mom is right.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.058
Hand me the salt.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.979
- We'll have fun!
- You two go.

05:12.730 --> 05:16.108
I can stay here,
taking care of the house.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.652
Don't even think about it.

05:19.445 --> 05:20.446
No way.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.869
- I want to stay. I've got things to do.
- PLEASE, DON'T IGNORE ME.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.038
- ARE YOU MAD?
-Mica, you can do them next week.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.623
Can I get some milk for you?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.002
- You?
- In my coffee, please.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.755
Mica, we are leaving, okay?

05:38.130 --> 05:40.340
And we'll get
the world off our backs.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.468
Please, hand me your cell phones.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.179
No, wait.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.766
- I need to send some messages.
- Me too. I'll hand it over later.

05:49.558 --> 05:53.562
Don't you realize phones
are tearing families apart?

05:54.521 --> 05:57.441
You're online all day
with your friends.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.443
And you're always watching the screen

05:59.526 --> 06:01.612
in case something comes up
at the office.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.572
Don't exaggerate.
I'm not watching it all day.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.408
Even when we make love,
you're on your cell phone.

06:06.492 --> 06:09.119
- Adriana!
- She's said worse, I'm used to it.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.539
Fine. You can mock me all you want.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.583
But one day you'll realize

06:14.666 --> 06:17.544
that I've done the best I can
to keep this family together.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.760
If it's so important to you, okay.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.054
Come on.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.473
Come on. Do it.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.876
I'VE JUST SEEN "INDECENT PROPOSAL"
AND YOU CAME TO MIND, DEMI.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.093
- Hi, baby.
- Hello.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.180
- How is my beautiful wife?
- I'm fine.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.520
- Your juice is ready.
- What are the plans for today?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.314
- I don't know.
- I want to pamper you.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.234
I'd love to spend the whole day
spoiling you.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.987
- What do we do?
- Let me think.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.948
I don't know. You tell me.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.950
What do you say...

07:30.117 --> 07:33.787
if we go upstairs, I set the jacuzzi,
light some candles...

07:34.288 --> 07:37.249
and we start making my mini me?

07:41.378 --> 07:43.380
Listen, I'll tell you what.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.007
What?

07:45.465 --> 07:50.596
I think we might consider
Siena's party as our last time...

07:52.222 --> 07:56.810
in The Game of Keys before we start
"the baby project."

08:00.189 --> 08:01.565
It's a great idea.

08:01.773 --> 08:02.983
- Really?
- Yes.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.738
- It'll be our last game. Right?
- I think so.

08:09.740 --> 08:13.785
Okay. So, what do you think
about going to the movies?

08:14.745 --> 08:17.789
Great. And I can buy some things
our Chata needs.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.169
Speak louder, I can't hear you.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.880
Leo has been a bad boy!

08:25.172 --> 08:27.216
And what happens to bad boys?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.385
They must suffer the consequences.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.348
Have you learned your lesson today?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.475
- I have, madam.
- Very good.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.852
Now, count for me!

08:40.187 --> 08:41.230
One...

08:41.939 --> 08:43.106
Two...

08:43.690 --> 08:44.816
Three...

08:45.234 --> 08:46.944
Jesus Christ! This is outrageous!

08:48.403 --> 08:50.197
We can explain, Carmen.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.116
I have no choice
but to report you for misconduct.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.327
- No, please.
- There's an explanation.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.916
Unless there's another way
to deal with this.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.175
On your knees!

09:12.135 --> 09:13.136
Now!

09:23.730 --> 09:24.773
Mom?

09:25.357 --> 09:29.361
Can I use my phone for a moment?
I'll give it back to you right away.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.905
I need to send
an e-mail to the office, too.

09:31.989 --> 09:35.575
No. Guys, we agreed to stay away
from our phones.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.661
You'll thank me later.

09:38.036 --> 09:42.249
Why don't we sing?
Let's do that!

09:42.374 --> 09:45.585
Honey, remember the song
we used to sing when Mica was a baby?

09:47.045 --> 09:48.964
Which one? I don't know...

09:49.047 --> 09:50.632
"Itsy Bitsy Spider", maybe?

09:50.716 --> 09:53.927
No, that typical one. The one
they used to sing to us too.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.513
Something about some elephants,
remember?

09:56.722 --> 09:59.558
♪ One elephant was swinging ♪

09:59.641 --> 10:02.394
♪ Over the spider's web ♪

10:02.894 --> 10:05.647
♪ It was so much fun,
How could he resist... ♪

10:06.106 --> 10:09.318
- Sing with me, everybody!
- Okay, fine.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.279
♪ Two elephants were swinging ♪

10:12.279 --> 10:14.865
♪ Over the spider's web ♪

10:14.948 --> 10:18.368
- ♪ How could they resist ♪
- Come on, Mica. Sing with us!

10:18.452 --> 10:20.746
♪ They went
To call another elephant ♪

10:21.204 --> 10:23.957
♪ Three elephants were swinging ♪

10:23.999 --> 10:25.667
♪ Over the spider's web... ♪

10:29.838 --> 10:32.382
I've said I'm sorry a thousand times.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.385
There's nothing going on
between me and Adriana.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.972
I'm tired of hearing
the same thing over and over again.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.310
The real problem wasn't Adriana.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.520
But you lied to me, Sergio.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.815
I know. But I've apologized.
What else do I have to do?

10:49.358 --> 10:52.110
- Do you want my trust back?
- I do.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.656
- OK. Come with me.
- Where are we going?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.533
Come on, let's go.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.046
500 pesos?

11:11.922 --> 11:14.091
I have 20, and a holy card.

11:14.508 --> 11:18.428
You need a lesson
on how to create a safe workplace.

11:19.096 --> 11:22.349
Please, teach us.
We've been disrespectful.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.727
- Yes, we've been very bad.
- Or maybe...

11:26.311 --> 11:31.274
you need a lesson on the importance
of discipline in raising children.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.861
- Yes, we need that.
- Yes.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.405
Teach us.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.700
And after that, we can move on
to more formal subjects.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.120
I love History.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.626
One of my favorite subjects
is the conquest of the New World.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.046
Are you ready for your lesson?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.340
Who wants to go first?

11:55.715 --> 11:56.800
- You?
- Me?

11:56.883 --> 11:57.801
Yes.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.678
Get down.

12:00.512 --> 12:04.641
This bottle includes
a slow-flowing nipple...

12:05.308 --> 12:07.519
- Look.
- I don't like that.

12:08.019 --> 12:11.440
It must be very uncomfortable
and it's not manly.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.525
- Don't be sexist.
- I'm not.

12:13.608 --> 12:17.028
I think it's amazing a man can bond
with his baby like this.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.157
You will be very comfortable
in a bra.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.076
In a bra. Okay...

12:23.118 --> 12:25.162
Hello. May I help you?

12:25.245 --> 12:29.583
Yes, we would like to try
this breastfeeding bra for men.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.919
"Milk Man"? They're selling
like hot cakes this year.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.213
- See?
- I'll see if they're still in stock.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.506
- No.
- Yes, please.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.508
- So?
- Yes.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.718
Okay. What size?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.555
- Medium? Small!
- Medium is fine.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.056
Okay. I'll be right back.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.103
Medium...

12:55.650 --> 12:58.069
With all the money it costs,
I'm sure it does the trick.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.529
Daniel!

13:00.363 --> 13:02.491
- Are you working here or what?
- No, no.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.784
- Hi there!
- Hello.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.540
I'm María, Daniel's wife.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.334
Honey, this is Valentín.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.044
Hi.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.464
I'm Gaby, Valentín's wife.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.759
- Introduce me to your friends.
- Sure.

13:21.176 --> 13:24.262
This is Daniel, Gaby.
And his wife María.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.390
- How do you know each other?
- From the club.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.267
What club...?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.269
- Tennis.
- Golf.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.647
We used to play golf.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.857
But you don't play golf.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.236
I tried the other day in the club.
Daniel was there too.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.489
- I showed him the facilities.
- It's so nice.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.741
It's amazing.
Haven't you been there?

13:45.116 --> 13:48.286
Let's have lunch there.
They can meet the managers.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.996
Good idea! Let's go.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.499
Look what I've found.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.125
Hi. Excuse me.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.835
Can you help me? It's "Milk Man".

13:55.835 --> 13:58.588
- Show your friends.
- Do you come together?

13:58.672 --> 14:02.509
- Is that "The Milk Man"?
- Right. Have you heard about it?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.302
May I? It's amazing.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.721
Feel it.
It's a hyper-realistic texture.

14:06.805 --> 14:09.015
Look at the hole
where the milk comes out.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.976
You know what's the first thing
I want to do?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.271
- What?
- Climb the mountain.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.606
I've heard that at a good pace

14:16.690 --> 14:19.025
you can reach the top
in about 3 hours.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.986
- What?
- Yes.

14:21.736 --> 14:25.198
We must do it at least once in
our lives. Nothing's going to happen.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.285
It's an amazing experience.
And we'll be okay.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.870
I don't know if you knew,
but I was a girl scout.

14:30.870 --> 14:35.584
So, everything is under control.
I won first place in survival.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.044
Are you sure, honey?

14:46.803 --> 14:50.265
- Are you scared?
- No. I'm super cool.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.226
I'm ready for the action.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.397
You're the master here.
I'll follow your lead.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.442
Okay. This is about trust.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.695
You trust me and I trust you.
We are a team.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.822
A team, right.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.952
- It's going to be a cool experience.
- You bet.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.579
I know.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.054
Come on, guys! Come on!

15:29.262 --> 15:31.931
We can do it!
We're almost there, okay?

15:32.057 --> 15:35.935
- Come on, guys!
- I miss the smog, I can't breathe.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.105
I need to find a spot to pee.
I'll be right back.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.607
And if we get lost?

15:40.899 --> 15:45.403
You're not going to get lost.
You simply have to go straight ahead.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.072
I'll be right back.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.158
I think I'm going to be sick.

15:51.076 --> 15:54.954
What's wrong with Mom?
She's been so weird lately.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.588
This is the perfect spot.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.391
On your feet!

16:50.009 --> 16:51.553
Siena, please.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.721
Help me.

16:53.930 --> 16:58.351
- Sorry. I can't help you.
- Please! Grow up!

16:58.518 --> 16:59.978
I said I was sorry a thousand times.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.813
Are you going to lie to me again?

17:01.896 --> 17:05.859
No, I promise.
I'll never lie to you again.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.820
Take me down!

17:10.155 --> 17:11.448
Siena, please!

17:12.699 --> 17:15.452
- Enough, please!
- Shall I bring you down?

17:17.412 --> 17:18.913
Fuck you!

17:24.836 --> 17:26.421
Come on, we're almost there.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.091
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.261
Sure you can, honey.
We're almost there.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.852
Oh, look.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.980
We made it!

17:54.407 --> 17:56.075
You are nuts, Dad.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.537
Be careful!

18:01.039 --> 18:03.416
We must admit that it's a great view.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.835
Yes. Mom was right.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.755
Hey, Dad?

18:10.632 --> 18:11.966
Where is Mom?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.445
Óscar!

18:34.113 --> 18:35.198
Óscar!

18:35.657 --> 18:37.367
Help!

18:37.659 --> 18:39.410
Help!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.794
I'M GOING CRAZY, TEXT ME BACK.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.462
NO SIGNAL

18:54.092 --> 18:55.385
Óscar!

18:59.389 --> 19:00.473
Óscar!

19:17.824 --> 19:19.325
How are you feeling?

19:19.409 --> 19:22.871
I heard your knee crack
while you were falling, old man.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.582
Leave me alone. I got hurt.

19:25.999 --> 19:29.335
You need to recover for my party.

19:29.502 --> 19:33.339
I know. Torturing me
made you feel better?

19:34.132 --> 19:35.133
Much better!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.887
- I'm glad you're enjoying it.
- Come on!

19:42.724 --> 19:45.101
- Adriana!
- Mom!

19:47.228 --> 19:50.857
- Mom! Where are you?
- Fuck!

19:51.900 --> 19:54.611
- Maybe something happened to her.
- No, she's fine.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.364
- Is she?
- Honey, relax. Everything is fine.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.199
Mom!

20:00.992 --> 20:02.160
Adri!

20:04.537 --> 20:05.622
Adriana!

20:06.289 --> 20:09.334
Mom! Where are you?

20:11.002 --> 20:12.545
She should be around here.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.505
Adri!

20:15.006 --> 20:16.132
Dad?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.552
It's Mom's cell.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.220
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.612
Stay right there.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.572
Adri!

20:41.324 --> 20:42.909
Adri! Hey!

20:44.202 --> 20:47.038
Are you okay? What happened?

20:47.288 --> 20:48.665
- Mom!
- Are you hurt?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.250
We thought you were swallowed
by a wild animal.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.129
Relax. Everything is fine.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.507
Jesus Christ, Óscar!

20:57.924 --> 20:59.592
It's not going to be all right.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.388
We're fucked, and you are
the only one who hasn't noticed.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.433
I don't understand, Adriana.
We've found you.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.645
I know where the path is.
We can head back.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.188
Something happened or what?

21:12.397 --> 21:14.607
Why did you leave me here
in the middle of the woods?

21:15.149 --> 21:18.319
We didn't leave you.
You said you'd join us.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.280
I could've died, you know?

21:22.031 --> 21:25.243
Mom! You said
you knew the way back.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.497
Hold her.

21:30.832 --> 21:34.002
It's okay, honey.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.337
My sweetheart.

21:38.881 --> 21:42.802
Relax. Everything is fine.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.763
With all that sex
I forgot to tell you.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.058
We've got a new client.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.895
She's willing to pay us a great deal
of money for planning her wedding.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.858
With that money you and I can go

21:57.400 --> 22:00.737
to India
for the tantric sex training.

22:01.112 --> 22:03.031
- It sounds nice.
- It does.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.951
We're planning
a Vegas-style wedding for her.

22:07.535 --> 22:12.999
Casino style,
and some exotic dancers.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.252
Fireworks.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.131
It'll be the best wedding in the country.

22:21.132 --> 22:24.677
I think it's stupid to spend
all that money on a wedding.

22:26.888 --> 22:30.141
I don't think it's stupid,
I find it romantic.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.643
And that's my job.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.437
Don't get upset, honey.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.982
I just don't understand
why people can spend all that money

22:38.024 --> 22:39.067
on a wedding.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.985
Who would do that?

22:42.070 --> 22:44.489
Aurelia Ortiz-Villalobos.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.576
Is she related
to Fernando Ortiz-Villalobos?

22:49.827 --> 22:51.204
She is his daughter.

22:55.208 --> 22:59.337
You can't plan that wedding, Bárbara.
That guy is the biggest crook.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.839
Remember Loma Linda's
real estate affair?

23:01.923 --> 23:04.550
Look! It's just a wedding.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.970
Banning my clients depending

23:08.054 --> 23:09.806
on what their parents
do for a living,

23:09.889 --> 23:12.475
or their political views,

23:12.975 --> 23:16.020
would leave me without clients.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.689
But you'd have honor.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.192
You're working for a criminal.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.070
Why don't you say it?

23:25.780 --> 23:26.948
Tell it to my face.

23:27.782 --> 23:28.991
Say it!

23:29.867 --> 23:33.079
Say you have no respect
for me or my job.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.959
I think it's frivolous.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.420
I hate weddings
and unnecessary expenses,

23:41.420 --> 23:43.214
but I've always tolerated it,
Bárbara.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.638
You tolerate my job?

23:52.223 --> 23:53.516
Well, thank you.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.435
You're a fucking spoiled boy.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.441
And you've also tolerated
that I take care of bills?

24:05.611 --> 24:07.530
Because your income...

24:09.157 --> 24:12.910
I might not make enough money,
but my job has a social purpose.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.413
Really? A social purpose?

24:16.038 --> 24:19.584
A social duty
would be to pay the mortgage,

24:19.625 --> 24:21.586
property taxes, tuition fees...

24:21.878 --> 24:23.504
At what expense?

24:24.046 --> 24:27.383
I won't support you on this.
This wedding sucks big time.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.385
Your wedding makes me sick.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.846
You make me sick.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.807
What sucks here is you.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.990
When Dad climbed a tree
looking for you,

24:51.282 --> 24:53.159
I thought he would die...

24:53.659 --> 24:56.287
and I would be left orphaned
and alone in the woods.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.498
You wish!

25:00.708 --> 25:03.252
But we were crying
desperately for her.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.218
I don't know why I got lost.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.428
I wasn't that far away from you guys,

25:12.511 --> 25:15.848
and all of a sudden
all the trees looked the same to me.

25:15.932 --> 25:19.310
I don't know what happened,
or how I got disoriented.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.811
Oh, God.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.731
Cheers to this fun day.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.360
- Cheers.
- To you, because we didn't lose you.

25:27.735 --> 25:31.155
The good news
is she won first place in survival.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.659
- Can you imagine?
- I swear I won it.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.203
- Oh, my God.
- Unbelievable.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.665
Otherwise I don't know
what you would've done.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.917
Neither do I.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.545
You're crazy, Mom.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.131
But I love you.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.218
It was worth getting lost
just to hear that.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.057
Shall we dance?

25:58.349 --> 26:01.936
- You're dancing this?
- You hate dancing to this.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.063
Come on, dance with me.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.009
What shall I do with your "Milk Man"?

27:16.010 --> 27:17.553
Try it yourself.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.389
I'll take the dog for a walk.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.370
Honey?

27:44.246 --> 27:45.748
I'll wait for you for dinner.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.125
- We'll be back in ten minutes.
- Okay.

27:59.095 --> 28:02.431
ÓSCAR, ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU'VE BEEN OFFLINE ALL DAY.

28:02.807 --> 28:06.685
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?
I HATE GOLF.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.944
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU,

28:15.611 --> 28:19.490
I'M GOING TO GO CRAZY
IF YOU DON'T TEXT ME BACK...

28:53.399 --> 28:55.067
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.611
I'M GOING TO GO CRAZY
IF YOU DON'T TEXT ME BACK...
