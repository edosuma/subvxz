00:04.083 --> 00:05.313
(SIGHS)

00:05.314 --> 00:06.542
I had the most

00:04.083 --> 00:06.542
awful date last night!

00:06.584 --> 00:08.125
What do you expect

00:08.127 --> 00:09.667
when you date guys

00:06.584 --> 00:09.667
from Match. Clown?

00:10.792 --> 00:12.542
He was not a clown.

00:12.584 --> 00:14.393
- Although that would
- explain the giant feet.

00:14.417 --> 00:16.000
And tiny car.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.042
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Oh, I'll get it!

00:19.083 --> 00:20.334
Me, too!

00:20.375 --> 00:22.167
- Anything's better
- than listening to this.

00:23.334 --> 00:24.688
Fine, from now on

00:24.689 --> 00:26.042
I'll just talk

00:23.334 --> 00:26.042
to the lizard.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.709
(GROWLS)

00:28.042 --> 00:29.876
- Oh, like you have
- something better to do.

00:32.542 --> 00:33.626
Ugh!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.500
Did somebody order

00:36.501 --> 00:38.000
a mean old lady?

00:39.459 --> 00:41.250
- Out of my way,
- Zsa Zsa.

00:43.792 --> 00:44.918
Hello, Bessie...

00:44.919 --> 00:46.042
Hello, sweet cheeks.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.083
(GROANS)

00:48.292 --> 00:50.334
I call upon you for a favor.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.855
I'm staying at a hotel

00:51.856 --> 00:53.334
while my apartment

00:50.375 --> 00:53.334
is being fumigated...

00:53.375 --> 00:54.418
Let me guess,

00:54.419 --> 00:55.459
when they spray,

00:53.375 --> 00:55.459
you scatter?

00:56.417 --> 00:58.000
I stand by my "ugh!"

01:00.000 --> 01:01.293
Anyway, they

01:01.294 --> 01:02.584
don't take pets.

01:02.626 --> 01:04.500
- Will you look after
- Zeusey while I'm away?

01:04.542 --> 01:06.167
I hate animals.

01:06.209 --> 01:07.772
Give me one good reason

01:07.773 --> 01:09.334
why I should watch

01:06.209 --> 01:09.334
that dust mop with ears.

01:09.626 --> 01:10.852
- How about
- a thousand reasons?

01:10.876 --> 01:12.059
- Welcome to - Bertram's Doggie
- Day Care!

01:12.083 --> 01:13.209
Where we pamper

01:13.210 --> 01:14.334
your mutt from

01:12.083 --> 01:14.334
head to butt!

01:15.626 --> 01:17.786
- You know he - would've done it
- For just 20 reasons.

01:18.417 --> 01:19.939
I also have a

01:19.940 --> 01:21.459
picture of myself

01:21.500 --> 01:22.543
so Zeusey

01:22.544 --> 01:23.584
won't miss me.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.044
- Can you put that away?
- I'm trying to eat here.

Whoa.

02:41.876 --> 02:43.834

02:43.876 --> 02:45.542
- Jessie Prescott,
- very single.

02:45.584 --> 02:46.918
- Wait, what was
- the question?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.751
- I'm Brooks Wentworth.
- Hello... Brooks.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.709
- So, do you live
- around here?

02:53.959 --> 02:55.059
- Yeah, just across
- the street.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.709
- But I'm originally
- from Texas.

02:56.751 --> 02:57.897
I love Texas! My family

02:57.898 --> 02:59.042
owns a place out there.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.834
- Oh, like,
- a vacation home?

03:00.876 --> 03:02.459
No, like, Houston.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.709
You own Houston?

03:04.751 --> 03:06.667
- What, Dallas is
- too expensive?

03:07.083 --> 03:08.418
Actually,

03:08.419 --> 03:09.751
it's family money.

03:09.792 --> 03:11.334
- It doesn't matter
- much to me,

03:11.375 --> 03:12.729
But it does mean

03:12.730 --> 03:14.083
I can run my own non-profit

03:14.584 --> 03:15.814
Here are the

03:15.815 --> 03:17.042
baby giraffes we

03:14.584 --> 03:17.042
rescued last week.

03:17.626 --> 03:19.125
- Aww...
- I love giraffes!

03:19.167 --> 03:21.059
- With their long legs...
- And those big eyes...

03:21.083 --> 03:23.059

- Of the Serengeti!

03:23.083 --> 03:24.417

03:31.042 --> 03:33.376

03:33.377 --> 03:35.709
nice, and you save

03:31.042 --> 03:35.709
baby animals?

03:35.751 --> 03:36.876
If I was your girlfriend,

03:36.877 --> 03:38.000
I'd tie you up and lock

03:35.751 --> 03:38.000
you in the basement!

03:39.083 --> 03:41.000
- No, just kidding.
- I don't have a basement.

03:45.961 --> 03:47.042
Bertram gets if

03:44.876 --> 03:47.042
we're late to lunch.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.124
- Yeah, he might - punish us by giving
- Us seconds.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.125
Right.

03:51.167 --> 03:52.876
Well...

03:53.834 --> 03:55.167
- Thanks again
- for catching me.

03:55.209 --> 03:56.876
- Thanks for being
- such a catch.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.876
Okay, catch you later.

Another run

04:06.709 --> 04:09.667
for the Yankees!

04:09.959 --> 04:11.376
I just do not understand

04:11.377 --> 04:12.792
the appeal of baseball.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.356
The players have

04:14.357 --> 04:15.876
to carry those big sticks,

04:12.834 --> 04:15.876
and they spit a lot.

04:15.918 --> 04:17.750
- It is neither
- safe nor hygienic.

04:25.335 --> 04:26.584
learn to like baseball

- if you came to
- a game with me.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.834
I would love to!

04:30.209 --> 04:31.626
Should I bring

04:31.627 --> 04:33.042
my nose plugs for

04:30.209 --> 04:33.042
when we do the wave?

04:33.083 --> 04:35.000
- Sports reference,
- nailed it!

- BERTRAM:
- Here you go, Zeus.

04:42.751 --> 04:44.042
- Zeus gets lobster
- for lunch?

04:44.083 --> 04:45.147
Yesterday you

04:45.148 --> 04:46.209
just opened the

04:44.083 --> 04:46.209
refrigerator door

04:46.250 --> 04:47.959
- and told us to,
- "Have at it."

04:49.209 --> 04:50.918
You have to give

04:50.919 --> 04:52.626
him an after-lunch

04:49.209 --> 04:52.626
massage?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.000
Then a paw-dicure?

04:54.626 --> 04:55.668
Yes, but I'll tell you

04:55.669 --> 04:56.709
where I draw the line.

04:56.751 --> 04:57.897
I am not doing

04:57.898 --> 04:59.042

that a little louder

05:05.083 --> 05:08.000

Ugh, watching

05:17.023 --> 05:18.125
Bertram do downward dog

05:18.167 --> 05:20.083
- makes me want to
- do upward lunch.

05:23.918 --> 05:25.042
Is there nothing on TV?

05:27.751 --> 05:28.897
That's enough.

05:28.898 --> 05:30.042
Come on, Zeus.

05:30.959 --> 05:31.959
Before your playdate

05:31.960 --> 05:32.960
with Miss Fifi,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.584
- we have to finish
- your mutt-scaping.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.542
I can't believe I forgot

05:37.543 --> 05:39.000
to give that cute guy in

05:36.083 --> 05:39.000
the park my phone number.

05:39.209 --> 05:40.167
Poor Jessie.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.042
- If it makes you
- feel any better,

05:42.083 --> 05:44.000
- He was way
- out of your league.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.083
Exactly how would that

05:46.084 --> 05:47.084
make me feel better?

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

05:48.375 --> 05:49.688

05:49.689 --> 05:51.000
I finally found you!

05:51.125 --> 05:52.584
And, I feel better.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.310
- Brooks, what are
- you doing here?

05:55.334 --> 05:56.792
- Well, after
- your fall earlier,

05:56.834 --> 05:58.226
- Wanted to make
- sure you were okay.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.647
And, since you love

05:59.648 --> 06:01.042
animals so much,

06:01.083 --> 06:02.667
- I got you this
- "Get Well" racehorse.

06:03.709 --> 06:05.334
- Really? Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

06:05.876 --> 06:07.209
Way to overshoot.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.291
- She would've - been happy with
- A scented candle.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.000
- So her name
- is Winter's Folly?

06:12.083 --> 06:13.563
Oh, she's a champion

06:13.564 --> 06:15.042
out of Summer's Folly.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.126
Broke maiden

06:16.127 --> 06:17.167
at Saratoga.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.418
A little slow on the

06:18.419 --> 06:19.626
clubhouse turn, but...

06:21.042 --> 06:22.709
What? I like horsies.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.209
- Guys, could you
- give us a minute?

06:25.250 --> 06:27.209
- Sure. We'll give
- you your privacy.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.376
So, how did you

06:31.377 --> 06:32.667
know where I lived?

06:34.083 --> 06:35.126
Well, when I

06:35.127 --> 06:36.167
couldn't find you

06:34.083 --> 06:36.167
in the phone book,

06:36.209 --> 06:38.059
- I just had a - family friend do
- A little snooping.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.042
- Well, is your
- friend a detective?

06:40.083 --> 06:42.000
- Sort of. - He's the head
- Of the C.I.A.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.459
Really?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.268
- If he mentioned - anything about
- My browser history,

06:46.292 --> 06:47.314
Luke sometimes

06:47.315 --> 06:48.334
borrows my laptop.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.001
That explains the weird

06:51.002 --> 06:52.834
obsession with Kate Upton

06:49.167 --> 06:52.834
and snowboards.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.083
(LAUGHS)

06:55.083 --> 06:56.083
Listen...

06:56.459 --> 06:58.292
I really came over

06:58.293 --> 07:00.125
here to ask you out.

07:01.292 --> 07:02.646
Want to go for Chinese

07:02.647 --> 07:04.000
food tomorrow night?

How did you know

07:08.127 --> 07:09.167
Chinese food

07:07.083 --> 07:09.167
was my favorite?

07:09.209 --> 07:10.251
Our friend at the C.I.A.

07:10.252 --> 07:11.292
was pretty thorough.

07:11.334 --> 07:12.751
Oh.

07:13.042 --> 07:14.751
- By the way, amazing
- dental records.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.250
Thanks! I floss.

07:17.375 --> 07:18.709
I'll see you tomorrow?

See you later, alligator.

- To ride my racehorse!

I haven't seen Jessie

I know!

07:48.125 --> 07:49.125
And that's who she's

07:49.126 --> 07:50.126
supposed to end up with!

07:50.167 --> 07:51.501
Not that big

07:51.502 --> 07:52.834
hunk o'handsome,

07:52.876 --> 07:54.480
with his strong arms,

07:54.481 --> 07:56.083
and his pretty face...

07:57.209 --> 07:58.209
Down girl.

08:02.834 --> 08:04.147
That was a humdinger

08:04.148 --> 08:05.459
of a sporting event!

08:05.500 --> 08:06.938
I cannot believe

08:06.939 --> 08:08.375
I caught a spheroid!

08:10.083 --> 08:12.063
It's a baseball!

08:12.064 --> 08:14.042
And you didn't catch it.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.918
- It fell into the
- popcorn bucket

08:15.959 --> 08:17.876
- You were using to
- shield your face!

08:21.209 --> 08:22.605
I hate baseball!

08:22.606 --> 08:24.000
And dogs!

08:24.292 --> 08:25.667
(BARKS)

08:25.709 --> 08:27.396
I know, I know.

08:27.397 --> 08:29.083
It's time for your

08:25.709 --> 08:29.083
aromatherapy,

08:29.125 --> 08:30.293
and for me to question

08:30.294 --> 08:31.459
my life choices.

08:33.458 --> 08:34.751
Now he questions

08:34.751 --> 08:36.042
his life choices?

08:33.458 --> 08:36.042
(CHUCKLES)

08:36.082 --> 08:37.082
Don't change

08:37.083 --> 08:38.083
the subject.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.458
I want this ball!

08:39.500 --> 08:41.125
- It was heading
- right for me.

08:41.167 --> 08:43.083
It was the longest

08:43.085 --> 08:45.000
home run ever hit

08:41.167 --> 08:45.000
in Yankee Stadium!

08:45.375 --> 08:47.459
Which is why

08:47.460 --> 08:49.542
classmates who saw me

08:45.375 --> 08:49.542
catch the ball on TV

08:49.584 --> 08:50.917
have already texted

08:50.918 --> 08:52.250
me to ask to see it.

08:52.292 --> 08:53.792
I am getting texts!

08:53.793 --> 08:55.292
Do you realize

08:52.292 --> 08:55.292
what this means?

08:55.334 --> 08:56.938
Yes. Your phone

08:56.939 --> 08:58.542
isn't "broken"

08:55.334 --> 08:58.542
after all.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.000
- Happy two week
- anniversary.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.980
Awww, I had no idea

09:04.981 --> 09:06.459
the two week anniversary

09:03.500 --> 09:06.459
present was hummus.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.042
- Well, you know
- what they say,

09:09.083 --> 09:11.000
- Chick peas are
- the legumes of love.

09:11.626 --> 09:13.209
No one says that!

09:13.250 --> 09:14.313
Not even the wives

09:14.314 --> 09:15.375
of chick pea farmers!

09:17.083 --> 09:18.083
Excuse me, Emma,

09:18.084 --> 09:19.083
may I please

09:17.083 --> 09:19.083
get a napkin?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.188
Our doorman has

09:20.189 --> 09:21.250
better hair than you!

09:22.584 --> 09:24.334
- So, that's a "no"
- on the napkin?

09:24.375 --> 09:26.209
- You're lucky
- you got hummus!

09:28.167 --> 09:29.250
- There you are,
- Brooksie.

09:29.292 --> 09:30.730
I got the oddest call

09:30.731 --> 09:32.167
from our stable.

09:32.209 --> 09:34.042
- It seems we're
- missing a racehorse...

09:34.417 --> 09:35.834
Mrs. Chesterfield?

09:35.835 --> 09:37.250
Tessie?

09:38.083 --> 09:39.083
Mother!

09:39.084 --> 09:40.084
Mother?

09:40.959 --> 09:42.000
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

09:45.083 --> 09:46.563
Wait, wait, wait...

09:46.564 --> 09:48.042
Mrs. Chesterfield

09:45.083 --> 09:48.042
is your mom?

09:48.083 --> 09:50.042
- But you don't have
- the same last name.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.042
- Mother changes it each
- time she remarries.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.542
Call me old fashioned.

09:53.584 --> 09:54.792
I guess I just

09:54.793 --> 09:56.000
respect the institution

09:53.584 --> 09:56.000
of marriage.

09:56.459 --> 09:57.792
Yeah, she respects

09:57.793 --> 09:59.125
it so much,

09:56.459 --> 09:59.125
she did it six times.

10:00.459 --> 10:01.584
Brooksie!

10:01.626 --> 10:03.042
- Why are you
- with this girl?

10:03.083 --> 10:04.542
- She's not good
- enough for you.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.376
Well, maybe I like

10:06.377 --> 10:07.626
girls who aren't

10:05.125 --> 10:07.626
good enough for me!

10:09.083 --> 10:11.000
That came out wrong.

10:11.334 --> 10:13.209
- No, I get it.
- Still sweet.

10:13.709 --> 10:15.896
Trust me, Brooksie.

10:15.897 --> 10:18.083
There are many, many, things

10:13.709 --> 10:18.083
to despise about this girl.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.042
- Oh, yeah?
- Name one.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.105
Well, she's a nanny,

10:22.106 --> 10:24.125
she has giant feet,

10:24.167 --> 10:26.083
- and I can hear her
- snore from downstairs!

10:27.083 --> 10:29.125
Hey! He said name one!

10:30.334 --> 10:32.188
Brooksie,

10:32.189 --> 10:34.042
why can't you be more

10:30.334 --> 10:34.042
like your brother?

10:34.083 --> 10:36.042
He always obeys me.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.042
- For the last time,
- he's not my brother.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.542
Zeus is a dog!

10:40.709 --> 10:42.147
I'm warning you,

10:42.148 --> 10:43.584
Brooksie.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.584
Don't defy me.

10:44.209 --> 10:46.105
Things can get

10:46.106 --> 10:48.000
very ugly for you if

10:44.209 --> 10:48.000
I don't get my way.

10:48.042 --> 10:50.000
- Just ask my
- ex-hairdresser.

10:50.167 --> 10:52.209
If you can find him.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.209
Huh.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.083
- Well, I think we've
- solved the mystery

10:58.125 --> 10:59.525
- Of the plugged up
- garbage chute.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:13.083 --> 11:14.667
Time for me to make

11:14.668 --> 11:16.250
the greatest steal

11:13.083 --> 11:16.250
in baseball history.

11:28.375 --> 11:29.375
Ah!

11:37.250 --> 11:38.459
Ooh, suction

11:38.460 --> 11:39.667
cup arrows.

11:39.709 --> 11:41.083
Like that's scary.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
(SCREAMS)

11:46.083 --> 11:47.542
That is scary!

12:06.125 --> 12:07.125
(LAUGHS)

12:08.083 --> 12:09.167
Yes!

12:16.250 --> 12:17.250
- (SCREAMING)
- No!

12:23.375 --> 12:26.000
Well, well, well...

12:28.125 --> 12:29.500
What a surprise.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.168
What, that I decided

12:32.169 --> 12:33.584
to steal your

12:30.751 --> 12:33.584
precious baseball?

12:33.876 --> 12:35.355
No, that my giant

12:35.356 --> 12:36.834
boulder actually

12:33.876 --> 12:36.834
fit down the stairs.

12:36.876 --> 12:38.626
- The physics were
- iffy on that one.

12:40.334 --> 12:41.834
Luke, why do you want

12:41.835 --> 12:43.334
this baseball so badly?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.084
I just do, okay?

12:45.085 --> 12:46.792
It's kind of personal.

12:47.292 --> 12:48.460
I am a person.

12:48.461 --> 12:49.626
Talk to me, bro.

12:50.751 --> 12:52.500
Well, the thing is...

12:53.334 --> 12:54.688
When I first moved

12:54.689 --> 12:56.042
to New York, rooting

12:53.334 --> 12:56.042
for the Yankees

12:56.083 --> 12:58.980
and going to the games

12:58.981 --> 13:01.876
helped me feel like

12:56.083 --> 13:01.876
a real New Yorker.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.418
I guess I just wanted

13:04.419 --> 13:05.751
a piece of the team that

13:03.083 --> 13:05.751
means so much to me.

13:06.292 --> 13:07.439
Aw. Luke, that is so...

13:07.440 --> 13:08.584
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

13:08.626 --> 13:09.792
Disgusting!

13:11.417 --> 13:12.834
I don't understand how

13:12.835 --> 13:14.250
you can poop something

13:11.417 --> 13:14.250
bigger than you are!

13:16.167 --> 13:17.584
It's easy if you focus.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.083
- And how - was everything
- This evening?

13:27.125 --> 13:28.459
Magnificent.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.417
- The rabbit rillettes
- were exquisite,

13:30.459 --> 13:31.980
And the chateaubriand

13:31.981 --> 13:33.500
was inspired.

13:33.542 --> 13:35.292
Yep. Super yummy.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.689
Oh, goody.

13:38.690 --> 13:40.209
I shall tell the chef it

13:37.167 --> 13:40.209
was, "Super yummy!"

13:43.375 --> 13:45.250
- Somebody's got his
- bow-tie in a bunch.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.188
Jessie, I want you

13:48.189 --> 13:50.250
to know my mother's

13:46.125 --> 13:50.250
threats don't scare me.

13:50.918 --> 13:52.417
- I really care
- about you,

13:52.459 --> 13:53.522
And I will not

13:53.523 --> 13:54.584
let her come

13:52.459 --> 13:54.584
between us.

13:56.209 --> 13:57.876
I already have.

13:58.167 --> 13:59.626
- (LAUGHS)
- Oh.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.730
FYI, I've canceled

14:02.731 --> 14:04.292
your credit cards!

14:04.334 --> 14:05.688
So, no more fancy dates,

14:05.689 --> 14:07.042
no more fancy clothes...

14:07.083 --> 14:08.125
No more money.

14:08.459 --> 14:10.167
Point, Rhoda!

14:13.709 --> 14:14.980
Ooh, I see tonight's

14:14.981 --> 14:16.250
special is beefcake.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.522
Note to self,

14:18.523 --> 14:19.709
stop working out.

14:21.542 --> 14:23.689
My apologies, sir,

14:23.690 --> 14:25.834
but your credit card seems

14:21.542 --> 14:25.834
to have been declined.

14:25.876 --> 14:27.460
Perhaps you accidentally

14:27.461 --> 14:29.042
gave me the lady's card?

14:30.584 --> 14:32.042
Joke's on you.

14:32.043 --> 14:33.500
No bank will

14:30.584 --> 14:33.500
give me a card.

14:33.751 --> 14:35.250
Quelle surprise!

14:42.042 --> 14:43.542
- Mother, you
- can't cut me off.

14:43.584 --> 14:45.083
- Even you're
- not that vicious.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.918
Oh, really?

14:46.919 --> 14:48.709
Just ask your stepfathers

14:45.125 --> 14:48.709
two through six.

14:48.751 --> 14:49.855
If you can find them.

14:49.856 --> 14:50.959
(CHUCKLES)

14:51.000 --> 14:52.751
- What, do you have
- your own landfill?

14:53.792 --> 14:55.501
I'll be over at my table,

14:55.502 --> 14:57.209
waiting for you to

14:53.792 --> 14:57.209
come to your senses.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.126
And watching that

15:00.127 --> 15:02.000
saucy waiter, Carlisle,

14:58.250 --> 15:02.000
carve a rump roast.

15:03.375 --> 15:04.918
Forget about her.

15:04.959 --> 15:07.640
- I'll pay for this - bill myself,
so we can - Just get out of here.

15:07.792 --> 15:08.918
Whoa, did we buy dinner,

15:08.919 --> 15:10.042
or a space shuttle?

15:10.542 --> 15:11.647
It's okay. I'll just

15:11.648 --> 15:12.751
call some friends, they'll

15:10.542 --> 15:12.751
come lend us the money.

15:14.042 --> 15:16.000
- Oh, no! She already
- canceled my phone!

15:17.042 --> 15:18.209
Don't worry.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.375
I have some friends

15:17.042 --> 15:19.375
with deep pockets, too.

15:20.667 --> 15:21.667
Hi, friends!

15:22.542 --> 15:24.183
- Can you lend us
- some money for dinner?

15:24.500 --> 15:25.792
Oh, Jessie...

15:25.834 --> 15:27.250
Of course not.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.250
What? Why not?

15:31.083 --> 15:32.126
Because you and

15:32.127 --> 15:33.167
Tony are perfect

15:31.083 --> 15:33.167
for each other,

15:33.209 --> 15:34.334
and we're not

15:34.335 --> 15:35.459
helping you until

15:33.209 --> 15:35.459
you dump this guy.

15:36.292 --> 15:38.167
- No offense,
- dreamboat.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.626
My name's Brooks.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.939
Shh, beautiful...

15:41.940 --> 15:43.209
No one wants to

15:40.667 --> 15:43.209
hear you talk.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.250
Guys, I told you,

15:48.292 --> 15:49.334
Tony and I are not

15:49.335 --> 15:50.375
getting back together.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.126
Fine. Then enjoy

15:52.127 --> 15:53.417
restaurant jail!

15:53.459 --> 15:54.959
Meanwhile,

15:54.960 --> 15:56.459
we're going to go sit

15:53.459 --> 15:56.459
with Mrs. Chesterfield

15:56.500 --> 15:57.834
and watch the show.

15:57.835 --> 15:59.167
Peace out, paupers.

16:02.709 --> 16:03.939
They're really

16:03.940 --> 16:05.167
lovely children once

16:02.709 --> 16:05.167
you get to know them.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.250
- (GASPS)
- Zeus!

16:11.292 --> 16:13.167
- Stop chewing
- on Luke's sock!

16:14.209 --> 16:15.688
Oh, great, now

16:15.689 --> 16:17.167
you're probably gonna

16:14.209 --> 16:17.167
need a tetanus shot.

16:19.918 --> 16:21.876
Wow, it looks like

16:21.877 --> 16:23.834
you feel the same way

16:19.918 --> 16:23.834
about these kids as I do.

16:25.334 --> 16:26.751
You're not such a

16:26.752 --> 16:28.167
bad little guy after all.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.375
- So, which kid
- annoys you the most?

16:37.876 --> 16:39.355
Well, judging by

16:39.356 --> 16:40.834
the little gift you left,

16:37.876 --> 16:40.834
I'm guessing it's Emma.

16:44.292 --> 16:45.668
Jessie, you don't have

16:45.669 --> 16:47.042
to scrounge for cash.

16:44.292 --> 16:47.042
I'll figure something out.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.059
- Well, actually, - I'm looking for
- My pepper spray.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.230
This isn't the first

16:50.231 --> 16:51.375
time I've had to

16:49.083 --> 16:51.375
escape a restaurant

16:51.417 --> 16:53.057
- because my date
- couldn't pay the bill.

16:55.584 --> 16:58.042
So, you're still here,

16:58.083 --> 16:59.730
and yet the little

16:59.731 --> 17:01.375
tray where the money

16:58.083 --> 17:01.375
goes is still empty.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.668
You two do understand how

17:03.669 --> 17:05.209
restaurants operate, right?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.334
- Maybe we can work
- something out.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.376
What would you say

17:10.377 --> 17:11.666
to this gold watch?

17:13.375 --> 17:15.126
I'd say, "Hello, Watch!

17:15.127 --> 17:16.876
Do you have any money?

17:16.917 --> 17:18.626
"As this establishment

17:18.627 --> 17:20.334
does not accept payment

17:16.917 --> 17:20.334
in timepieces."

17:22.083 --> 17:23.209
Okay, okay,

17:23.210 --> 17:24.334
we will pay you,

17:24.375 --> 17:26.209
- right after I get back
- from the bathroom.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.375
Very well.

17:28.416 --> 17:29.709
And before you

17:29.710 --> 17:31.000
ask, you don't need

17:28.416 --> 17:31.000
a token to use it.

17:34.334 --> 17:35.792
- I think I'm
- winning him over.

17:38.626 --> 17:40.209
So, do you have a plan,

17:40.210 --> 17:41.792
or did you just drink

17:38.626 --> 17:41.792
too much iced tea?

17:42.375 --> 17:43.500
Both.

17:45.042 --> 17:46.310
- There's a window - near the ceiling
- In the ladies room.

17:46.334 --> 17:47.376
I can sneak out,

17:47.377 --> 17:48.417
and empty

17:46.334 --> 17:48.417
my bank account.

17:48.459 --> 17:50.292
- And if that
- doesn't work,

17:50.334 --> 17:51.584
I'll see if anyone here

17:51.585 --> 17:52.834
is interested in buying

17:50.334 --> 17:52.834
a slightly used racehorse.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.375
- Maybe we should
- have helped Jessie.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.542
- Yeah, I feel
- kind of guilty.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.813
Guilt disappears,

18:04.814 --> 18:06.542
like wrinkles after

18:03.083 --> 18:06.542
a visit to Dr. Lookgood.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.000
- I guess you haven't
- been there in a while.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.000
- Jessie, what happened?
- Are you okay?

18:19.083 --> 18:21.042
It turns out balancing on

18:21.043 --> 18:23.000
a toilet seat in heels is

18:19.083 --> 18:23.000
a lot harder than I remember.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.042
- Aw, geez,
- I'm so sorry.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.626
- That is just
- water, right?

18:30.083 --> 18:31.542
And tears.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.000
When I dropped my purse,

18:30.083 --> 18:33.000
it activated the pepper spray.

18:37.375 --> 18:39.001
Hey, Ravi.

18:39.002 --> 18:40.626
I've given it a lot of

18:37.375 --> 18:40.626
thought, and...

18:41.834 --> 18:43.231
I'm sorry I've been

18:43.232 --> 18:44.626
hassling you about

18:41.834 --> 18:44.626
the baseball.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.334
You should keep it

18:46.335 --> 18:48.000
because I love you.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.522
Oh, thank you, Luke.

18:50.523 --> 18:51.959
But I gave it away.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.272
I hate you!

18:53.273 --> 18:54.459
Why would you do that?

18:56.083 --> 18:57.563
Well, actually,

18:57.564 --> 18:59.042
I did not give it away.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.397
I traded it to the Yankees.

19:00.398 --> 19:01.709
For this...

19:06.083 --> 19:07.959
Holy Mo Rivera!

19:12.083 --> 19:14.042
Hey, these are all signed

19:14.083 --> 19:16.918
to "Luke 'Chick Magnet' Ross!"

19:17.083 --> 19:19.001
Yes. I thought you

19:19.002 --> 19:20.918
would like that better

19:17.083 --> 19:20.918
than Luke "Philbert" Ross.

19:21.542 --> 19:22.647
And you have not

19:22.648 --> 19:23.751
seen the best part.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.292
"Luke 'Chick

19:27.293 --> 19:28.500
Magnet' Ross,

19:30.083 --> 19:32.083
"you are hereby

19:32.084 --> 19:34.083
officially designated

19:30.083 --> 19:34.083
a Yankees bat boy!"

19:35.083 --> 19:36.855
I hope you do not

19:36.856 --> 19:38.626
get dizzy hanging upside

19:35.083 --> 19:38.626
down in the dugout.

19:38.667 --> 19:40.375
- Sports humor,
- nailed it!

19:42.918 --> 19:43.980
What looks good,

19:43.981 --> 19:45.042
Carlisle?

19:45.083 --> 19:46.417
Besides you.

19:48.834 --> 19:49.918
Looks like somebody

19:49.919 --> 19:51.000
is ordering husband

19:48.834 --> 19:51.000
number seven.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.542
Carlisle, whip cream

19:53.543 --> 19:55.000
and keep it comin'!

19:55.125 --> 19:56.563
Yes, just what you need,

19:56.564 --> 19:58.000
more sugar.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.918
- All right, it's gotta
- be here somewhere...

20:02.125 --> 20:03.459
Thank you.

20:04.209 --> 20:05.709
Okay, that was new.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.125
A-ha!

20:08.167 --> 20:10.042
Trying to escape, were we?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.542
Wait a minute...

20:11.543 --> 20:13.000
This isn't the coat room.

20:15.584 --> 20:17.334
Nice try, Gussie.

20:17.335 --> 20:19.083
Two points, Rhoda!

20:22.083 --> 20:24.083
Jessie, this is ridiculous!

20:24.125 --> 20:25.584
I'm just going to be a man,

20:25.585 --> 20:27.042
and tell my mommy

20:24.125 --> 20:27.042
to pay for our dinner!

20:29.083 --> 20:30.125
Brooks, wait.

20:30.667 --> 20:31.855
I'm not just worried about

20:31.856 --> 20:33.042
paying for this meal.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.563
It's all the meals after this.

20:34.564 --> 20:36.042
And for the rest of your life.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.125
Maybe it is better

20:38.126 --> 20:39.125
if you just break up

20:37.125 --> 20:39.125
with me.

20:39.167 --> 20:40.542
Jessie, no!

20:40.584 --> 20:41.855
Are you really willing to

20:41.856 --> 20:43.125
give up your entire lifestyle,

20:43.167 --> 20:44.584
the money, everything,

20:44.585 --> 20:46.000
for a girl you just met?

20:46.542 --> 20:48.423
- Although, I do look
- bangin' in this dress...

20:50.042 --> 20:51.521
You mean, the girl

20:51.522 --> 20:53.000
who is willing to fall

20:50.042 --> 20:53.000
into a toilet for me?

20:54.083 --> 20:55.834
- Who loves animals
- as much as I do?

20:57.083 --> 20:59.000
- Who makes me melt
- when I look into her eyes?

21:01.167 --> 21:02.834
- Maybe this'll
- answer your question...

21:04.000 --> 21:06.042
Mother, we need to talk.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.897
Oh, Brooksie,

21:07.898 --> 21:09.709
thank heavens you've

21:06.083 --> 21:09.709
come groveling back.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.271
Now, let's get out of here

21:11.272 --> 21:12.542
before somebody sees me

21:10.000 --> 21:12.542
with "new money" here...

21:14.042 --> 21:15.542
Mother, that's it!

21:15.543 --> 21:17.042
I've had it! I don't

21:14.042 --> 21:17.042
need your money.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.042
- I'm sick of you
- controlling me!

21:19.083 --> 21:21.667
I don't control you!

21:21.709 --> 21:22.709
Blow.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.083
No! No!

21:25.542 --> 21:26.731
I've had a better time

21:26.732 --> 21:27.918
with Jessie these

21:25.542 --> 21:27.918
past few weeks

21:27.959 --> 21:29.792
- than I've ever
- had in my life!

21:30.083 --> 21:31.709
- You should really
- try go-karting.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.876
- So you can
- keep it all, Mother.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.105
Because I'd rather

21:36.106 --> 21:37.292
be poor and happy

21:34.918 --> 21:37.292
with Jessie,

21:37.334 --> 21:39.000
than rich without her!

21:40.292 --> 21:41.646
That's the most

21:41.647 --> 21:43.000
wonderful thing a guy

21:40.292 --> 21:43.000
has ever said about me!

21:44.042 --> 21:46.000
- Seriously,
- number two is,

21:46.042 --> 21:47.481
"It's so refreshing to date

21:47.482 --> 21:48.918
a girl who really knows her

21:46.042 --> 21:48.918
way around a carburetor."

21:50.334 --> 21:51.772
Jessie, for the last

21:51.773 --> 21:53.209
time, we want you

21:50.334 --> 21:53.209
to be with Tony!

21:53.250 --> 21:55.001
Brooks, for the last time,

21:55.002 --> 21:56.751
I want you to be with

21:53.250 --> 21:56.751
anybody but Stressie!

21:58.083 --> 22:00.042
Hey! You know what,

22:00.083 --> 22:01.188
it's not about what

22:01.189 --> 22:02.292
makes you happy.

22:02.334 --> 22:04.167
- It's about what
- makes us happy!

22:04.209 --> 22:05.646
That's right! And we will

22:05.647 --> 22:07.083
stay here in this restaurant

22:04.209 --> 22:07.083
forever if we have to!

22:07.667 --> 22:09.125
Oh, no you won't!

22:09.918 --> 22:11.501
You people have caused

22:11.502 --> 22:13.083
enough commotion.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.000
- And you're covered
- in toilet water.

22:16.709 --> 22:18.125
I will pay your bill.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.959
- Thank you.
- I'll pay you back.

22:21.083 --> 22:22.542
Your absence will

22:22.543 --> 22:24.000
be payment enough.

22:24.083 --> 22:26.000
- Plus, I'll take
- that watch.

22:27.334 --> 22:28.584
Ow!

22:28.918 --> 22:30.000
That's your tip.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.083
And here's a tip for you.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.084
Call your lawyer,

22:33.125 --> 22:34.147
I'm suing you

22:34.148 --> 22:35.167
for harassment.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.667
(LAUGHS)

22:37.709 --> 22:38.814
I love it when they

22:38.815 --> 22:39.918
play hard to get.

22:42.209 --> 22:43.250
So...

22:44.334 --> 22:45.647
You may have

22:45.648 --> 22:46.959
won this battle.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.792
Point, lovebirds!

22:49.959 --> 22:51.209
But the war is not over!

22:52.083 --> 22:53.667
Come, urchins.

22:54.709 --> 22:56.790
- Are you sure - there's enough room
- On your broom?

22:58.083 --> 22:59.480
Well, I don't know

22:59.481 --> 23:00.876
how we're going

22:58.083 --> 23:00.876
to get home.

23:01.918 --> 23:03.758
- I have a feeling
- Mother's canceled my limo.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.938
Well, we could do

23:05.939 --> 23:07.292
what most New Yorkers do,

23:04.584 --> 23:07.292
and take the subway.

23:07.876 --> 23:09.250
- I've always
- wanted to do that!

23:09.292 --> 23:11.375
- Are there really
- giant alligators down there?

23:11.959 --> 23:13.064
Yes, but they are

23:13.065 --> 23:14.167
not as scary as that guy

23:11.959 --> 23:14.167
who plays his nose hair.

23:15.876 --> 23:17.751
- Hold my hand?
- Gladly!

23:24.959 --> 23:26.626
See, I told you!

23:26.627 --> 23:28.292
It's freaky!

23:28.334 --> 23:29.730
So Bertram's watching

23:29.731 --> 23:31.125
Dog Dynasty with Zeus.

23:31.167 --> 23:32.918
- What's so strange
- about that?

23:34.250 --> 23:35.647
What's strange is that

23:35.648 --> 23:37.042
Mrs. Chesterfield took Zeus

23:34.250 --> 23:37.042
back two hours ago!

23:39.083 --> 23:40.083
More cheese, buddy?

23:40.125 --> 23:41.792
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:43.209 --> 23:45.125
Num, num, num, num.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.876

23:50.083 --> 23:51.334
Oh, you're welcome.

23:51.876 --> 23:53.042
(IMITATING DOG PANTING)

23:54.417 --> 23:56.000

- from the butler.
