My name is Tyreek Wanamaker.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.834
I'm 27 years old,
and I live in Fishtown in Philly.

00:42.917 --> 00:43.752
Bro.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.922
I have always been told
that I look like Snacks Harrison.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.132
Also Questlove.

I've been called them.<i> </i>[laughs]

"He was nominated by his boss
and long-time mentor Christina

00:56.639 --> 01:00.268
and Tommy,
his brother from another mother."

01:00.351 --> 01:01.728
You can't see the resemblance?

01:02.520 --> 01:04.230
We're obviously brothers.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.648
We look damn near alike.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.735

01:08.818 --> 01:11.696
[Tommy] Reek's by far one of the most
lovable people I know.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.366
He loves just helping people
and helping the community.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.743
-Thank you.
-No problem.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.244
I love to see other people happy.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.080
Growing up was rough,

01:20.163 --> 01:23.708
and the people who were there for me
made a huge impact,

01:23.792 --> 01:25.835
and I want to make that same impact
for other people.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.671
-Ooh, this is good. More volunteers.
-[laughs]

01:28.755 --> 01:31.591
Currently I am working
at Mighty Writers in West Philly,

01:31.674 --> 01:34.010
teaching kids the art of the pen.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.721
[Christina] I met Tyreek ten years ago.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.640
He was a high school student
where I was working.

01:38.723 --> 01:42.727
The dropout rate was 50%,
but he beat the odds.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.480
"Tyreek was raised
by a family friend Ruth,

01:45.563 --> 01:47.857
who kept him off the dangerous streets
of North Philly

01:47.941 --> 01:50.068
and focused him on attending college."

01:50.151 --> 01:51.194
Thanks, Ruth.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.488
[Tyreek] I consider Ruth my mother.

01:53.571 --> 01:57.742
She's probably the most vibrant person
that I have ever met.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.578
Like, she was a professional pool player,
and, like...

02:01.246 --> 02:03.289
Living with Ruth was...

02:03.873 --> 02:05.375
[laughs] amazing.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.668
Just felt like home.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.671
But one day, we had an argument,

02:09.754 --> 02:11.881
and... it changed my life.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.926
I moved back with my biological mom.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.679
It wasn't an easy transition.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.224
And then my brother killed someone.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.143
Uh...

02:26.020 --> 02:30.441
And my mom was afraid that
people were going to come to retaliate.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.694
My family kind of dispersed,

02:32.777 --> 02:35.155
and I was basically out on the streets.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.739
It was a struggle.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.492
[Tommy] I know he slept in vehicles,
abandoned apartments.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.703
For a full year he slept in a shed.

02:41.786 --> 02:42.620
Wow.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.665
Not having that sense of security
can really be hard on you.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.459
[Tyreek]
During the time that I was homeless,

02:48.543 --> 02:50.587
my friends helped me stay afloat.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.798
They made sure I had clothes and food.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.091
They kept me alive.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.596
[Tommy] Poverty could definitely make you
do a lot of negative things,

02:59.679 --> 03:01.639
but he's always kept his head straight.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.558
He was finally able to get an apartment,

03:03.641 --> 03:06.144
and he's been stable
for a little over a year.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.354
He's really a remarkable guy,

03:08.438 --> 03:13.651
but I'm not sure that he really feels
proud of what he has accomplished.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.698
I haven't felt like I've lived up
to the standards that I set for myself,

03:19.282 --> 03:23.244
but I finally got my own place, and now
I want to have that sense of family back,

03:23.328 --> 03:26.915
and the last time that I felt, like,
that bond of family,

03:26.998 --> 03:27.957
I was living with Ruth.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.876
[Karamo] "This is our mission this week.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.066
[Jonathan] Tell us more.

05:17.608 --> 05:21.112
So, I grew up in North Philly.
Every house was a crack house.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.113
-Wow.
-Wow.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.824
In our neighborhood, you see
a lot of things growing up down there,

05:24.907 --> 05:29.287
but during high school, me and my friends
decided that somebody in the community

05:29.370 --> 05:32.582
needed to stop the complaining
and do the work.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.543
Like, when we go out
and we do street cleanings,

05:35.626 --> 05:38.046
it's not just to beautify the block,

05:38.129 --> 05:41.591
but make sure that people know that,
like, this is ours, you know?

05:41.674 --> 05:42.717
[Tan] How did that come about?

05:42.800 --> 05:45.511
[Tyreek] Randomly, we'd go out and just
hand out food to the homeless.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.724
And then it went on
to becoming a big thing.

-[Tyreek] Yes.

-[buzzing]

09:34.407 --> 09:36.450
the sanitation has gone awry.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.290
Hi, big bear. Are you scared to be here?

09:42.707 --> 09:43.749
Yeah, you are?

09:44.125 --> 09:46.210
You want him to clean it? Yeah, you do.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.462
So this is where all the magic doesn't

09:48.546 --> 09:50.256
-currently happen.
-Doesn't currently happen.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.301
Like, I only really eat at work.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.969
I just don't develop routine.

09:55.052 --> 09:58.264
I'm always one foot on the gas.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.515
-And I--
-Well, what do you expect?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.809
-Like, that's how you've lived your life.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:01.892 --> 10:05.688
The stability I have right now is
something I've been wishing for

10:05.771 --> 10:08.190
my whole life,
but the only thing on my mind

10:08.274 --> 10:09.150
has been, like,

10:09.525 --> 10:11.110
how this could possibly fall apart

10:11.193 --> 10:13.195
and what I need to do
to make sure it doesn't.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.323
You've busted your ass to be here.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.240
Yeah.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.284
This is your home now. It's like,

10:18.951 --> 10:20.244
I want you to enjoy it.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.662
-Yeah.
-So, like, end of the week,

10:21.746 --> 10:24.498
what's the vision? What do you want
to be able to do in your own kitchen?

10:24.915 --> 10:27.960
I wanna just be able to, like,
plan a meal for my friends.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.212
And what does that look like?
What's the dish?

10:30.296 --> 10:34.008
So, Ruth would go out and buy,

10:34.550 --> 10:36.844
[laughs] like, 100 crabs, and, like,

10:36.927 --> 10:39.347
potatoes and corn and get a big pot--

10:39.430 --> 10:40.598
Like, a full-on crab boil.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.309
Yeah, and cover the whole table
with newspaper and plastic...

10:43.392 --> 10:44.852
-Yeah.
-...and just go to work.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.562
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.606
[Tan] Quick PSA for you all.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.525
If a pair of jeans or pants
has a belt attached,

10:51.609 --> 10:53.361
it's a no-go, hard pass.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.363
Catch. [grunts]

10:56.447 --> 10:58.449
-Yes!
-Yeah, more!

10:58.532 --> 11:00.326
Come on, more! Yes!

11:00.409 --> 11:03.496
Oh, no, that was like Trump
in Puerto Rico, girl. [shouts]

11:04.830 --> 11:08.584
So this is your first place
that you could, like, make your own,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.753
-put own stamp on it.
-Yeah. Yeah.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.797
What has prevented you
from kind of doing that?

11:12.880 --> 11:13.756
Money.

11:14.548 --> 11:17.134
-[laughs]
-I get that. So, a little background.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.012
-Mm-hmm.
-I've been homeless. I've lived in my car.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.099
I've couch surfed
till I've almost drowned.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.393
Like, this year is the first time

11:25.476 --> 11:28.396
I'm able to worry about more things
than just, like, survival.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.314
[Bobby] I'm really proud of Tyreek.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.150
He's pulled himself up out
of being homeless, and now

11:33.234 --> 11:36.278
he finally can take control
of his own future.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.533
Are you able to save now?
Do you have a bank account?

11:40.616 --> 11:43.411
And I ask that because
I didn't used to, either.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.162
-So I don't have a bank account.
-Okay.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.580
I went to the bank to start an account,

11:46.664 --> 11:49.750
and they told me that there was something
wrong with my Social Security card.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.545
I used to keep my Social Security card
in my wallet

11:52.628 --> 11:56.549
because I was always bouncing around,
and I lost my wallet before,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.134
so what I think happened is

11:58.467 --> 12:00.219
somebody's been using
my Social Security card.

[Karamo] Before we got to this guy,

12:19.071 --> 12:21.198
who was young Tyreek?

12:21.282 --> 12:24.285
When I was still an infant,
my mom had moved into a new apartment

12:24.368 --> 12:27.538
and there were only so many people
she could bring into the apartment.

12:27.621 --> 12:31.041
So, my family decided to send me away
to a friend of the family's.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.918
-So, did your other siblings go with you?
-No.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.796
She just was like,
"Somebody has to go somewhere,"

12:35.880 --> 12:37.089
-and that was me.
-Yeah.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.300
So, I moved into Ruth's house,

12:39.383 --> 12:41.469
and she took care of me
until I was 11 years old.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.971
So, what was that time for you
when you were living with her?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.973
-Fun. [laughs]
-Yeah.

12:46.056 --> 12:50.644
I was always, like, a smart kid,
always loved learning new things.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.147
-Yeah.
-Ruth was a huge resource.

12:53.230 --> 12:57.860
Growing up with somebody who actually
put in time and effort into my education.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.070
So, why did you leave Ruth's house?

13:00.154 --> 13:02.823
Honestly, I still don't know
the whole story, even now.

13:02.907 --> 13:03.991
I'm 27 years old, I don't know.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.410
I think part of it was that

13:06.494 --> 13:09.955
I had a lot of pent-up anger
that I didn't really know how to express

13:10.039 --> 13:12.666
with the situation I had going on
with my biological mom,

13:12.750 --> 13:15.377
and I took to my journal one day
after an argument,

13:15.711 --> 13:19.882
and wrote in it
that I wish that Ruth died.

13:20.257 --> 13:24.178
And she went through my journal,
saw that and flipped out.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.180
And that was the end of it.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.182
Have you talked to her since?

13:28.265 --> 13:30.851
Twice, and both of those times
were this year.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.104
One of them,
I was going through the neighborhood,

13:34.188 --> 13:35.898
I knocked on the door, she came out,

13:35.981 --> 13:37.858
saw me, gave each other a big hug.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.361
She misses me and wants me
to stay in contact with her.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.487
But, like,

13:41.570 --> 13:44.240
staying in contact was a hard thing,
I think, for me emotionally

13:44.323 --> 13:46.367
because I felt like
I failed her a little bit.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.160
So, you've been avoiding her?

13:48.244 --> 13:51.622
-Yeah.
-Makes sense. Did you ever get to ask her

13:51.705 --> 13:54.333
if the reason you left her house
was because of that journal?

13:54.875 --> 13:56.627
We've never talked about it.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.379
So there's no resolution there?

13:58.462 --> 13:59.505
Yeah, yeah.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.798
-[Bobby] Hello.
-Hi.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.550
-What's going on?
-Welcome.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.051
So, I think what we want to do

14:04.134 --> 14:07.429
is let the world see
that you've had a challenging past,

14:07.513 --> 14:08.806
but you didn't let it define you.

14:08.889 --> 14:09.765
Should we get started?

14:09.849 --> 14:10.891
-Yes.
-[Karamo] I'm excited.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.935
Let's come in for one big group hug
before we go.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.937

<i>♪ Let's go, let's go ♪</i>

14:20.025 --> 14:23.612
Tyreek has busted his butt
to finally have a place to call his own,

14:23.696 --> 14:26.282
where his friends can come over,
where he can cook for them,

14:26.365 --> 14:27.867
where he can be comfortable.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.744
I want him to know what that feels like
because he deserves it.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.664
[Jonathan] Tyreek's external look
doesn't totally match

14:33.747 --> 14:36.292
the strength of the message
that he has on his inside,

14:36.375 --> 14:38.794
and so we need to kind of, like,
rework that a little bit

14:39.253 --> 14:42.089
so that he can really empower himself
with the love and education

14:42.172 --> 14:43.424
that he gives to everyone else.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.842

[Tan] I love that Tyreek knows

14:47.928 --> 14:50.514
He just doesn't have the tools
to be able to execute.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.391
And that's where I step in.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.811
I think there's a few things
that he's struggling with.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.438
First is just pride in himself.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.607
Second is pride in his home.

15:00.107 --> 15:03.569
And I think if I can set his home up
to be something that he's proud of,

15:04.028 --> 15:07.239
he can go even further in life
than he's already gotten himself.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.953
[Karamo] Tyreek has done such an amazing
job of overcoming obstacles in his life,

15:13.037 --> 15:16.290
but this week I want him to realize
that he has to confront his past

-May I have a hug?
-You, too. Yes.

that Ruth is really important to him,

17:28.297 --> 17:29.256
so I want to meet with her

17:29.339 --> 17:33.052
and see if she's open and willing
to give him the answers that he deserves.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.928
-I met with Tyreek.
-Okay.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.764
And one of the most special times

17:36.847 --> 17:38.849
in his life that he talks about
is with you.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.893
Well, it was really great.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.353
-Yeah?
-He was always a jolly baby.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.189
-Really?
-Always.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.691
-And he was mine. I loved him.
-Yeah, yeah.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.860
For him, there's confusion.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.447
'Cause he said that he was with you
until the age of 11.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.325
So, he was wondering, what you mean?
Why he was gone?

17:56.408 --> 17:57.242
Yeah.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.079
-My daughter, she had a child.
-Mm-hmm.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.706
He was, like, 24 weeks premature.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.291
He had to have his heart mended.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.793
He had brain bleeds,

18:05.876 --> 18:08.295
so they took him from her,
so I had to get him out

18:08.378 --> 18:09.755
-of foster care.
-Yeah.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.549
And they said I couldn't have the both
of the children.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.509
Hmm.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.845

Talking to Miss Ruth, I realized there's
an obvious miscommunication going on.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.816
She didn't want to give him up,

18:29.316 --> 18:30.734
but he needs to hear that.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.945
Why didn't you tell him?

18:33.028 --> 18:34.154
I didn't think to tell him.

I just told him
he was going with his mother.

Yeah. At times I talked to him online
and I always write something,

18:49.753 --> 18:51.839
but I didn't know where he was at.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.298
He never

18:53.382 --> 18:56.093
-really came to visit me or nothing.
-Yeah, yeah.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.304
I think it's gonna be interesting
for you to hear

18:59.930 --> 19:03.350
why he thinks he was taken out the house.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.685
Because in his mind...

19:05.894 --> 19:08.605
he doesn't think it's anything
about any of this.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.315
What did he think it is?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.942
I think he needs to tell you that.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.528
-Yeah.
-[laughs] I sure do wanna hear it.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.321
-Yeah.
-I really do.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.364
-Yeah.
-Mm.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.700
Well, thank you for your honesty.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.743
-I appreciate you.
-Oh, you're welcome. Mm!

19:26.582 --> 19:29.001
[dance music playing]

19:31.128 --> 19:33.589
[Tan]
Will you join me in our loft, please, sir?

19:33.714 --> 19:34.798
-[Tyreek] Ooh.
-[Tan] Nice, right?

19:34.882 --> 19:35.966
[Tyreek] Yeah. Yeah.

19:36.049 --> 19:40.053
So, I know that you are not dressed
the way you would like to dress.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.599
Yeah. My wardrobe and my confidence have

19:43.682 --> 19:46.602
-a deep-tie in with each other.
-Yeah.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.855
And I've missed big moments because
I've looked at my wardrobe and said

19:49.938 --> 19:51.315
-that I can't dress for this event.
-Wow.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.192
It puts you in slumps, you know?

19:53.275 --> 19:54.651
I get that. I get that.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.195
I hate the thought of

19:56.278 --> 19:58.655
you not being able to attend
the things that you want to attend,

19:58.739 --> 20:00.490
and so I want to play
a little dress-up with you.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.451
-Yes, yes. [laughs]
-Okay, great.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.038
Tyreek doesn't want to look like
your average dude in a suit.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.332
He is a lot more stylish than that,

20:08.415 --> 20:13.128
but there aren't many options
for men of his size and his height,

20:13.212 --> 20:16.757
and so I decided to order online

20:16.840 --> 20:19.468
and then show Tyreek what I have for him.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.970
Okay, I love this.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.097
Yeah, I like this a lot.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.182
-Yeah.
-Good.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.059
-That makes me so happy.
-Love it. Yeah.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.519
[Tan] You are giving yourself layers.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.689
This top that you've got on right now,
it's got different levels.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.815
I call it tricking the eye.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.108
-Yeah.
-So, it doesn't focus

20:35.192 --> 20:36.443
on one thing in particular.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.612
If this were a baggier pant,
it wouldn't work.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.697
You would just look wide and short.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.741
But because it is slightly more tapered,

20:42.824 --> 20:45.077
you are looking taller and put together.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.788
Just these couple of tweaks
can really change your proportions,

20:47.871 --> 20:48.956
-and that's what this does.
-Yeah.

20:49.039 --> 20:52.292
Do you see that when you look in
the mirror when you dress more like that?

20:52.376 --> 20:54.169
-Everything just feels nice. [laughs]
-Good.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.004
Yeah. I see a brighter future.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.258
-I like that.
-[laughs]

21:00.342 --> 21:03.011
[Tan]
The way he's looking at himself is like,

21:03.095 --> 21:05.013
"Oh, yeah, there is a higher power."

21:05.973 --> 21:06.807
It's fashion.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.394
So, I want to talk to you about something
called a capsule collection.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.563
-Mm-hmm.
-You'll notice this whole rack is

21:13.647 --> 21:15.899
-a very simple color story.
-Okay.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.526
Everything's interchangeable.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.112
-So, you'll have maybe ten to 15 pieces...
-Yeah.

21:20.195 --> 21:24.199
...that you can break up and make
30, 40 looks from.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.076
Tyreek doesn't have the funds to be able

21:26.159 --> 21:29.121
to freshen up his wardrobe
every few weeks,

21:29.204 --> 21:32.499
and so I wanted to get Tyreek
a capsule wardrobe

21:32.582 --> 21:35.252
when he has just a few pieces
that he can interchange.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.255
He gets to be stylish
with very little effort.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.799
I love fatigue, and this is definitely...

21:42.092 --> 21:44.344
-fire.
-[laughing]

21:44.428 --> 21:45.387
Fire. I love it.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.889
Did we nail it on the first fitting?

21:49.558 --> 21:51.018
Yeah, mate!

21:51.101 --> 21:52.185
[laughs]

21:52.728 --> 21:54.479
<i>♪ It's like fire ♪</i>

21:54.563 --> 21:57.607
<i>♪ Burning up, time to rock it</i>
<i>Turn it up ♪</i>

21:57.691 --> 21:59.901
<i>♪ Make it hot, make it hot... ♪</i>

21:59.985 --> 22:02.487
-[Antoni] Have you heard of Aether?
-I have not heard of Aether, no.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.282
They are experts at seafood,

22:05.365 --> 22:07.451
-and that's why we're here.
-Oh, that's my thing.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.703
[Antoni]
I want Tyreek to have a fun experience,

22:09.786 --> 22:11.538
something to gets him connected to food.

22:11.621 --> 22:16.043
A crab boil is something that's very
emotional to him. It ties him to family.

22:16.626 --> 22:20.213
It's not the most technical recipe,
it's actually really simple.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.133
It's just a matter of sequencing
and how we put everything into the pot.

22:23.216 --> 22:26.636
So, we're gonna start out with andouille,
the sausage.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.723
Because I want this to be a full meal too,
and not just crab, but the idea of, like,

22:29.806 --> 22:31.475
you and your friends
at the end of the week

22:31.558 --> 22:32.893
enjoying this whole meal together.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.395
I want the newspaper,
the whole experience.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.940
So, we're gonna cut these up
into just some nice, little, thin slices.

22:39.024 --> 22:39.858
[Tyreek] Okay.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.611
[Antoni] We're gonna put these directly
onto the pan.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.612
[sizzling]

22:43.987 --> 22:46.323
Now shucking corn.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.533
[Tyreek] This is actually something
I've never done before.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.202
-You've never shucked corn?
-No.

22:50.285 --> 22:53.121
It is one of the most
satisfying things ever.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.041
Try to rip it somewhere near the center
so that you get all the filaments.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.167
Okay.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.212
-[Antoni] Look at you, shucking corn.
-[laughs]

23:00.295 --> 23:03.215
We have our pot,
we have a couple of cups of water.

23:03.298 --> 23:07.677
Then what we're gonna do
is pour in our alcohol.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.473
So, you've never made a crab boil
since you moved out of Ruth's house?

23:11.765 --> 23:13.308
[Tyreek laughs]
I've never made one in my life.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.559
-[Antoni] Never made one in your life?
-Yeah.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.728
-[Antoni] So you'd just watch her make it?
-Watch her make it, yeah.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.481
Wait, so you've only had, like,
small talk with Ruth, basically.

23:19.564 --> 23:23.110
Yeah. Pretty sure she has no idea about
anything that's going on in my life.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.528
Yeah, that's how it is with my mother.

23:24.611 --> 23:25.570
Yeah, yeah.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.739
I haven't spoken to mine in,
like, five years.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.032
[Tyreek] It's tough.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.493
It is hard because when you know
how important family is...

23:31.576 --> 23:33.078
-Yeah.
...if you have a little taste of that,

23:33.161 --> 23:34.663
and then that's taken away from you,

23:34.746 --> 23:36.998
you work harder to get it elsewhere.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.959
That's why I gravitated towards some
of the people

23:39.042 --> 23:40.168
-that I gravitated towards.
-Yeah.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.546
When I first met Tommy, like,

23:42.629 --> 23:45.048
we talked for ten minutes,
and it felt like we were brothers.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.050
And, like, that's important.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.761
You just want something,
something tangible.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.221
-Yeah.
-And at Ruth's house,

23:51.304 --> 23:53.765
I grew up in a house
that was very much about affection,

23:53.849 --> 23:56.017
and, like, nurturing and, like,

23:56.101 --> 23:57.769
so much of my life was just, like,

23:57.853 --> 24:00.439
-wanting that feeling back.
-Right.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.732
-Like, you're figuring it out as you go.
-Yeah, yeah. [laughs]

24:03.567 --> 24:07.654
Now, our onion, which is gonna give
a really nice sweetness to it.

24:08.905 --> 24:11.408
Now we gotta season. Old Bay.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.285
[Tyreek] The good stuff.
Is there ever really too much?

24:13.368 --> 24:15.871
[Antoni] This is one of those, like,
"season aggressively" situations.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.539
-Yeah.
-What are we missing?

24:17.998 --> 24:21.668
[Tyreek]
Uh... ah, yes, the stars of the show.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.963
So, the safe way to grab a crab
is from behind?

24:25.046 --> 24:25.881
[Tyreek] Mm-hmm.

24:27.799 --> 24:28.967
I'm excited.

24:29.050 --> 24:29.885
Yes!

24:30.510 --> 24:33.180
Tyreek didn't have the upbringing
that he wanted to have,

24:33.680 --> 24:35.974
but his memories of crab boil...

24:36.057 --> 24:37.309
[laughing]

24:37.434 --> 24:41.354
...shouldn't just be a thing
that you look back on in nostalgia.

24:42.063 --> 24:42.898
[Tyreek] Yes.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.108
-Talk about, like, a passing of the torch.
-[Tyreek] Yeah.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.570
-You're like a grown man with his home
-[laughs]

24:48.653 --> 24:51.198
who's taking care of himself
and can prepare a beautiful meal.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.825
-Yeah, an adult. [laughs]
-Adult.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.996
-Mmm! This is so fricking good.
-It's amazing.

[Karamo] I want you to take me around more
now that we're over here

25:46.044 --> 25:49.381
because I think it's really important
to see your old neighborhood.

25:49.464 --> 25:52.259
[Tyreek]
Well, Ruth's house is the next block over.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.803
That's the old family house.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.388
-This is the house you grew up in?
-Yeah, yeah.

25:57.055 --> 26:01.142
No matter how the neighborhood
may look like, it was ours, you know?

26:01.226 --> 26:03.061
-Yeah.
-[Tyreek] It just felt like home.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.314
But there's, I know,
a lot of darkness that also happened.

26:06.398 --> 26:10.860
Yeah, like,
you're always one moment away from...

26:11.236 --> 26:13.071
just being somebody else that got killed

26:13.530 --> 26:15.365
or being somebody else that went to jail.

26:15.448 --> 26:17.492
Like, my brother is serving life.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.245
-My brother and I are the same person.
-Yeah.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.289
He's just as smart.

26:22.372 --> 26:25.417
Like, his thing was just not having
the right people in his life,

26:25.500 --> 26:29.087
and I think, like,
Ruth was a huge resource.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.339
[Karamo] You had something that was stable

26:31.423 --> 26:33.508
-in such an unstable world.
-Yeah.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.468
That was huge for me.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.053
But it was taken away from you.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.140
Yeah, yeah. And it's jarring.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.267
I mean, you just get hit with, like,

26:42.350 --> 26:44.853
one day you're
in an entire different world.

26:44.936 --> 26:45.770
Yeah.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.898
[Tyreek]
Like, I went from, like, every day...

26:50.025 --> 26:51.401
and, like, seeing her,

26:51.484 --> 26:55.363
you know, and, like, for so long,
that part of my life has been missing.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.325
And I think I carried that
into, like, every relationship.

26:58.575 --> 27:02.203
Like, I'm always constantly trying
to prove that I'm, like, good enough.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.246
Hmm...

27:03.330 --> 27:06.625
It's very unfair,
what happened to you as a child.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.378
But that had nothing to do with you.

27:13.214 --> 27:15.050
Tyreek has been telling himself
an old story

27:15.133 --> 27:17.218
that he is not loved
and he doesn't belong,

27:17.302 --> 27:19.095
and it's time that he starts
to confront that.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.349
You can't build a future
without really facing your past.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.892
I met with Ruth.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.935
[laughs] Okay.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.689
She is ready to talk to you
and give you the answers.

27:29.773 --> 27:30.690
Ugh.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.276
So, you're gonna call Ruth right now

27:33.360 --> 27:35.904
and invite her to come and speak with you.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.031

[sighs] It's just...

28:16.820 --> 28:20.448
I've been sitting on it for a while,
and it's time.

28:20.949 --> 28:21.825
<i>All right.</i>

28:22.409 --> 28:25.704
Uh, tomorrow at my place at four?

28:26.663 --> 28:28.123

-All right.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.750
-Bye.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.716
I don't hear her voice a lot, and...

28:40.844 --> 28:41.720
I miss that.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.263
I miss that a lot.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.515
It's just the beginning.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.685
It's time to get the answers you need.

28:49.144 --> 28:49.978
Yeah.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.439
I'm proud of you.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.357
Thank you.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.494
[Tyreek laughs] Awesome.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.538
-[Jonathan] Hi.
-[Karamo] Hey, boo.

29:08.621 --> 29:09.831
-How are you doing?
-Hi.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.374
-Hey, my baby.
-[Jonathan kisses] Good to see you.

29:11.791 --> 29:13.293
[Jonathan] Mm! Hi, honey.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.837
It's good to see you. Come on, gorgeous.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.213
Yeah, I love this place.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.758
-No!
-Yes. I gotta go.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.968
You should give us a double pirouette
on your way out.

29:22.051 --> 29:24.220
Five, six, seven, eight. One...

29:24.304 --> 29:25.263
[laughing]

29:25.346 --> 29:27.640
Kind of clearing it. Bye, y'all.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.560
Ugh. We got to work on those doubles.
Come on in.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.770
-[woman] Hi, Tyreek.
-[Jonathan] Take a seat.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.063
-[Tyreek] Hello, hello.
-How you doing? What's going on?

29:34.147 --> 29:36.816
This is Shahada. I'm basically gonna be
her gorgeous assistant.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.568
You ready to get the side
of this hair handled today?

29:38.651 --> 29:39.652
-Yes.
-[Shahada] All right.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.237
So, what we've got going on
in here is that

29:41.321 --> 29:43.156
a lot of these locks
have doubled themselves.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.365
[Tyreek] I need new ways to style it.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.951
I don't know how to make it uniquely me.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.453
[Shahada]
I'm gonna make you look spectacular.

29:48.536 --> 29:51.581
-Ooh, yeah, yeah! [grunts]
-[laughs]

29:51.664 --> 29:55.001
The dreadlocks going on Tyreek right now
are what are called "reformed."

29:55.084 --> 29:58.171
But the issue is
it lacks intention and planning.

29:58.254 --> 30:01.090
[Shahada] We're gonna get out any
impurities, any build-up.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.344
We have just not had quite enough time
and financial resources

30:04.427 --> 30:05.595
over these last couple years,

30:05.678 --> 30:08.431
and so we have
our stunning loctician Shahada

30:08.515 --> 30:11.601
to really help these dreadlock dreams
become a reality.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.271
Ooh!

30:15.355 --> 30:18.441
So, you're just gonna retwist those
little babies into one for that length?

30:18.525 --> 30:19.400
[Shahada] I think so.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.236
Wow, wow, wow.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.822
What about baby Ruth?

30:24.614 --> 30:26.866
Are we nervous to see?
Are we excited to see?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.743
She's like your very formative, like,

30:28.827 --> 30:30.995
-childhood, like, mama.
-[Tyreek] Yeah.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.958
She taught me a lot about just, like,
how to care for other people,

30:35.542 --> 30:37.335
and, like, I've tried to

30:37.836 --> 30:39.838
replace her by being her,

30:39.921 --> 30:42.966
so me and a bunch of friends
do a ton of events.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.634
We pick different streets across the city,

30:44.717 --> 30:46.010
clean them up, throw a block party,

30:46.094 --> 30:47.846
we get the businesses in the area.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.848
Love that community activism...

30:49.931 --> 30:51.516
-Yes, yes. [laughs]
-...and organization.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.894
[Tyreek] My focus is so much on trying
to help everybody who needs help.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.939
-And they need-- [laughs]
-Okay, but so... [stammers]

30:58.022 --> 31:01.234
I want you to take 10% of the advocacy
that you do for your community

31:01.317 --> 31:02.777
-and start doing it for yourself.
-Yeah.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.322
That's a huge problem I have,
is, like, setting boundaries.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.408
I love-- here, shall we role play?

31:08.491 --> 31:09.576
-Let's. Yes.
-Okay.

31:09.659 --> 31:13.454
Imagine me as having
bountiful, perky breasts

31:13.538 --> 31:15.790
and a tiny little snatched waist, and...

31:16.207 --> 31:19.627
Imagine I'm Shahada.
Just imagine I'm her, okay?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.087
-[Tyreek] Right, right.
-[laughing]

31:22.755 --> 31:25.174
-Oh, hey, Tyreek.
-[laughing]

31:25.258 --> 31:26.259
-Hey.
-[Jonathan] Hey.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.637

31:30.096 --> 31:32.348
I've been really going through so much,

31:32.432 --> 31:34.434
-and--
-He's a way better me than me.

31:34.517 --> 31:37.770
-[laughs]
-I just needed a ride over to the salon.

31:37.854 --> 31:40.565
-Now is not good for me.
-So maybe, like, later?

31:40.648 --> 31:41.816
Um...

31:42.150 --> 31:45.320
Probably not. I'm pretty busy.

31:45.403 --> 31:49.407
-Okay.
-[laughing]

31:50.450 --> 31:53.536
I love those exercises.
It's good to practice saying no.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.413
-That's a small action you can take...
-[Tyreek] Yeah.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.916
...that shows you, Tyreek, from Tyreek,

I'm getting ready
to take you to your new home,

32:49.217 --> 32:50.760
but with your new home
comes new responsibilities,

32:50.843 --> 32:54.263
and I want to make sure
that you're set up for success, so...

32:54.347 --> 32:56.641
-[Tiffany] Hi.
-I have brought my girl Tiffany.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.559
-Nice to meet you.
-She's a financial educator...

32:58.643 --> 33:00.561
-Nice to meet you, Tyreek.
-...and financial planner,

33:00.853 --> 33:02.981
to set you up for financial success.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.692
So, I've heard a lot about you

33:05.775 --> 33:07.694
and your situation and circumstance,

33:07.777 --> 33:09.696
and it's very similar to my own.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.989
-Yeah.
-And so,

33:11.072 --> 33:14.283
just tell me a little bit about,
probably, your biggest concern.

33:14.367 --> 33:17.203
[laughs] My biggest concern is not...

33:18.037 --> 33:19.706
being prepared for, like,

33:20.039 --> 33:23.126
-financial disasters. [laughs]
-Okay.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.086
He has shared
with me some information about

33:25.169 --> 33:27.130
-being able to get a bank account.
-Yes.

33:27.213 --> 33:29.924
He has had some people
who have clearly stolen his identity.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.553
So, I would say, immediately,
you want to freeze your credit,

33:33.636 --> 33:36.097
so that way no one else,
moving forward, can use your credit.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.765
-Right.
-And secondly, the reason why

33:37.849 --> 33:40.309
you're likely not able
to open up a bank account

33:40.393 --> 33:43.604
is because you've been reported
to something called ChexSystems.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.190
-Been on that list.
-So have I at some point, right?

33:46.274 --> 33:49.027
So, let's just say
you had an overdraft at one bank

33:49.110 --> 33:51.195
and you didn't pay that overdraft back,

33:51.279 --> 33:52.947
they're gonna tell every other bank,

33:53.489 --> 33:55.700
"Tyreek should not be allowed
to open up a bank account here."

33:55.783 --> 33:59.412
But the good news is every bank
does not use ChexSystems.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.497
So, I want you to open up a checking

34:01.581 --> 34:03.458
and a savings account
with one of those banks.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.293
-Some of those banks are major banks.
-Okay.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.836
[Bobby] Talking about your finances,

34:06.919 --> 34:08.963
it's an awkward conversation
to have with anybody,

34:09.047 --> 34:10.840
especially people you don't really know,

34:10.923 --> 34:12.759
but I couldn't leave this week

34:12.842 --> 34:17.472
without really making sure that
he's going to be able to continue

34:17.555 --> 34:21.184
to have that sense of security
and continue to have that success.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.769
If you automate your bills,

34:22.852 --> 34:25.021
automate your savings,
automate your transfers...

34:25.104 --> 34:27.523
If you do that, you're just standing
at the top of the mountain,

34:27.607 --> 34:30.443
watching your minion money
do what you told it to do.

34:30.526 --> 34:33.988
So, I made sure I created what I like
to call your "live richer plan."

34:34.072 --> 34:38.159
You're gonna learn how to budget, save,
get out of debt and improve your credit

34:38.242 --> 34:39.619
in 36 days.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.454
-Thank you.
-[Tiffany] Yes, you're welcome.

You are past survival.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.042
-You have now entered thrive mode.
-Okay.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.752
-I'm ready to thrive.
-Good.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.545
-Ready to see your new house?
-Of course.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.<i> </i>Wow. Yes.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.643
So, before, the room was very closed off

35:45.726 --> 35:47.895
because the sectional was facing this way.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.690
I flipped everything around.
I utilized this wall for the TV.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.441

35:52.525 --> 35:56.863

36:00.950 --> 36:02.660
You're like, "What else did I get?
What else is there?"

36:02.743 --> 36:05.997
So, if you guys noticed, he now has
a kitchen in a completely different room.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.206

-This thing is amazing.
-I love the Smeg.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.974
[Bobby] I did open shelving over here

36:25.057 --> 36:27.768
because you still have the storage,
but it makes the space feel bigger.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.020

36:29.103 --> 36:31.564

And I want you to start feeling
that sense of security.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.496
Yeah, like,

37:29.038 --> 37:31.249
-[Bobby] Yeah.
-Yeah. [laughs]

This is amazing.

-[Karamo] Let's take a seat.
-[Tyreek] Awesome.

37:35.795 --> 37:38.839
You're meeting with Ruth.
What is the biggest question you have?

37:39.215 --> 37:41.801
Um... does she still love me?

37:42.677 --> 37:45.721
'Cause I've been feeling
from a lot of places that...

37:47.098 --> 37:48.432
I'm not good enough,

37:48.891 --> 37:49.767
and...

37:50.685 --> 37:53.354
that's one of the places it started.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.481
But what I want you to remember...

37:56.274 --> 37:59.277
is that no matter what happens
in this conversation,

37:59.652 --> 38:02.738
you have overcome so many adversities.

38:03.030 --> 38:06.158
You have still found the courage
to help other people

38:06.659 --> 38:07.868
in your time of need.

38:07.952 --> 38:08.869
Yeah.

These are the things
that make you a success.

It takes a lot for me
to accept that sometimes.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.627
Say it for me.
I'm not gonna have you leave

38:16.711 --> 38:18.587
until you're very comfortable saying,
"I'm a success."

38:18.671 --> 38:19.630
I'm a success.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.049
I'm a success. I know I'm a success.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.217
Yeah.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.887
Yeah! Give me a hug.

-[Tyreek] Yes.
-[Tan] I got you playful, playful,

38:36.314 --> 38:38.316
to make sure that this feels

38:38.399 --> 38:41.110
as close to who you actually are
and want to be.

38:41.193 --> 38:42.903
-You said you love a bold print.
-Yes!

38:42.987 --> 38:45.364
-Yes!
-You're not-- okay, good!

-Nice, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.121

is filled with footwear.

so many great footwear options.

Look at the shoes, Kev.

46:09.975 --> 46:11.310
-Oh, wow.
-Kev, look at the--

46:11.810 --> 46:14.480
-I mean, he does look incredible.
-[Antoni] Yeah.

46:14.563 --> 46:15.731
-[laughing] Hey!
-[man] The man...

46:15.814 --> 46:18.650
-[man] The man, the myth.
-[man 2] Look at him. Look at him.

46:18.734 --> 46:19.651
My God.

46:19.735 --> 46:20.694
You got weights on your ankles?

46:20.778 --> 46:23.530
-'Cause, boy, you too fly.
-[laughing]

46:23.614 --> 46:25.365
Bro. Bro.

46:26.074 --> 46:27.201
-This is a new man.
-Yeah.

46:27.284 --> 46:30.746
-Hi. Oh, my gosh!
-[man] Look at him.

46:30.829 --> 46:33.165
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

46:33.874 --> 46:35.918
[Jonathan] I love Tyreek having a moment
to be in the spotlight.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.045
It's so gorgeous to just see him, like,

46:38.128 --> 46:40.005
just soak up this, like, gorgeous,
positive attention

46:40.088 --> 46:41.548
from the people in his life
that mean the most.

46:41.632 --> 46:44.176
Oh, my gosh. Oh!

46:44.301 --> 46:45.761
[Tyreek] I'm glad y'all finally got
to meet. 'Cause y'all--

46:45.844 --> 46:46.720
-Oh, my gosh.
-[Ruth laughs]

46:46.804 --> 46:48.096
-Y'all both been real important to me.
-[sighs]

46:48.180 --> 46:50.641
This is a man who felt like
he didn't have a family.

46:50.724 --> 46:53.977
-And look at his home now. Full of love.
-[Bobby] Full of love and family.

46:54.061 --> 46:54.895
[Karamo] Yeah.

46:56.522 --> 46:57.356
[Christina] Wow!

46:57.439 --> 46:59.650
-[Ruth] This is really good.
-[Christina] This is something else.

46:59.733 --> 47:00.776
[laughing]

47:00.859 --> 47:02.402
-To Tyreek!
-Tyreek!

47:02.486 --> 47:04.655
-To Tyreek!
-Yay!

47:12.454 --> 47:16.375
-[Antoni laughs] Walter! What a good boy!
-[sniffs]

47:16.458 --> 47:17.960
Is that your jeans, Ant?

47:18.418 --> 47:20.212
No, Tanny, it must be Walter.

47:20.295 --> 47:22.047
No, no, no. [sniffs]

47:22.130 --> 47:23.549
-Tanny, it's Walter.
-Take them off.

47:23.632 --> 47:24.967
I'm telling you, it's your jeans.

47:25.050 --> 47:27.469
Get up. I'm going to solve the problem
for you. Take your jeans off.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.973
Everyone likes to humiliate Antoni.

47:32.266 --> 47:35.769
Wanna get rid of that rancid smell without
washing your jeans and fading them?

47:35.853 --> 47:38.564
Simple. Put them in the freezer
for up to six hours,

47:38.647 --> 47:41.733
and it's gonna get rid of that smell
and that gross bacteria. [clicks tongue]

47:46.738 --> 47:48.740
Freezing your jeans. It works every time.
