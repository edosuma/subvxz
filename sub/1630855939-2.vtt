Welcome to <i>The Rayman Show</i>!

[TV producer] Look, kid.
Nobody wants to see a monster on TV.

00:31.458 --> 00:32.875
Maybe because I'm different,

00:32.875 --> 00:34.541
I can make a difference.

01:15.541 --> 01:17.958
I've been waiting here for 40 minutes!

01:20.250 --> 01:22.166
[Pagan Min] Dom! Dominique, my friend.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.833
I am so sorry.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.458
I know we had a meeting, but I...

01:25.458 --> 01:27.458
hmm, I totally lost track of time.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.791
How was your flight?

01:28.791 --> 01:29.875
You're late.

01:29.875 --> 01:31.708
Come on, Dom. You know how it is.

01:31.708 --> 01:35.208
Yeah, I know you'd rather
get your ass spanked than talk business.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.666
[chuckles] Yes, I do like
a good spanking. [laughs]

01:37.666 --> 01:39.958
- You think this is funny?
- Here we go.

01:39.958 --> 01:43.375
I've lost three good men
to get this piece of junk for you!

01:43.375 --> 01:45.375
[Pagan] Well, clearly not good enough!

01:45.375 --> 01:48.625
[menacing music playing]

01:48.625 --> 01:49.791
All right, all right.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.750

and I'm sorry about your men.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.750
Can we talk business now?

02:08.041 --> 02:11.375
Nice. Worth all the trouble.

02:11.375 --> 02:14.625
Dom, it's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

Give me everything.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.833
Well, that's not something
you see every day.

03:39.833 --> 03:40.833
I said--

03:40.833 --> 03:43.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, there. Easy, easy.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.041
Whoa, dude, you look like shit.

03:46.708 --> 03:49.458
Tell me, what's your name? [echoing]

03:49.458 --> 03:50.541
[Warden] <i>Dolph Laserhawk.</i>

03:51.166 --> 03:53.000
This is a mission briefing,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.583
and I need your undivided attention.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.208
So stop daydreaming.

03:57.791 --> 04:00.375
- [Dolph grumbles]
- [Warden] Good. Once again then.

04:00.375 --> 04:04.250
This is the Golden Super-Scope,
a device of massive power

04:04.250 --> 04:06.500
that can open a portal
to another dimension.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.291
It was stolen from one
of Eden's research labs.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.833
We believe it's now in the possession
of the triad's kingpin, Pagan Min.

04:13.833 --> 04:14.916
That guy.

04:14.916 --> 04:18.291
I've been trying to expose him for years.
He is one crazy motherfucker.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.583
Precisely.

04:19.583 --> 04:21.583
Pagan Min is your
run-of-the-mill mob boss.

04:21.583 --> 04:24.166
He likes violence
and long walks on the beach.

04:24.166 --> 04:25.958
But above all, he likes control

04:25.958 --> 04:29.416
and doesn't hesitate using
the cheapest, dirtiest tricks to keep it.

04:29.416 --> 04:32.125
You mean, like,
planting bombs inside people's heads?

04:32.125 --> 04:35.083
[both laughing]

04:36.208 --> 04:37.041
Right.

04:37.583 --> 04:41.833
So, your mission
is to infiltrate Pagan Min's fortress,

04:41.833 --> 04:44.666
deactivate the security,
take care of his guards,

04:44.666 --> 04:47.583
and make your way
to his private quarters to the top.

04:47.583 --> 04:51.416
Min's pagoda is the city's
biggest underground gambling scene.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.541
Clandestine fights,
hookers, drugs, you name it.

04:54.541 --> 04:56.458
The whole thing is heavily guarded.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.833
So, Pey'j,
you are an up-and-coming wrestler

04:58.833 --> 05:01.000
with his femme fatale agent.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.416
I don't do femme fatale.

05:02.416 --> 05:04.125
- [Warden] Now you do.
- What? Come on!

05:04.125 --> 05:06.041
[Warden] Bullfrog,
you go through the sewers.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.875
Oh, yes! So I can murder him.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.583
- [Warden] No. Pagan must live.
- Aw.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.416
[Warden] You don't touch Pagan Min.

05:11.416 --> 05:13.166
Once you guys take care of security,

05:13.166 --> 05:14.958
it's your turn, Laserhawk.

05:14.958 --> 05:17.208
Locate the scope's signature in the lobby,

05:17.208 --> 05:20.833
put the replica in its place,
boom. A simple in and out.

05:21.416 --> 05:23.000
Now go. And remember...

05:23.875 --> 05:26.625
You are ghosts. You don't exist.

05:29.083 --> 05:32.000
<i>This is Jade, reporting
from a Supermaxx cell.</i>

05:32.000 --> 05:32.916
<i>Day four.</i>

05:33.791 --> 05:38.541
<i>The cybernetic woman known as the Warden
is forcing us to operate her dirty deeds.</i>

05:38.541 --> 05:41.250
<i>A death sentence looming
from literally inside our heads.</i>

05:41.250 --> 05:44.166
- <i>Hey! Hey!</i> Coucou! [laughs]
- [gasps] <i>Bullfrog!</i>

05:45.708 --> 05:47.666
<i>This is the Super-Scope replica</i>

05:47.666 --> 05:50.958
<i>we will have to swap
with the original one in Min's pagoda.</i>

05:50.958 --> 05:53.333
<i>Laserhawk,
how do you feel about this mission?</i>

05:53.333 --> 05:56.125
- [Dolph grumbles]
- [Jade] <i>Okay. No comment then.</i>

05:57.208 --> 06:01.541
<i>Well, as an</i> assassin<i>, I think
it will be easier to kill Pagan Min</i>

06:01.541 --> 06:03.500
<i>and then steal the Super-Scope.</i>

06:03.500 --> 06:06.500
<i>But when the boss is saying
you don't</i> assassin<i>, we don't</i> assassin<i>--</i>

06:06.500 --> 06:07.708
[Jade groans] <i>Okay.</i>

06:07.708 --> 06:09.083
<i>Hey, Pey'j!</i>

06:09.083 --> 06:11.083
<i>Are you done in there? Pey'j?</i>

06:11.083 --> 06:12.583
[Pey'j] <i>You're gonna make fun of me.</i>

06:12.583 --> 06:14.458
[Jade] <i>I swear
we won't make fun of you. Right?</i>

06:14.458 --> 06:15.375
<i>Uh... Yes.</i> Promis juré.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.291
- [Jade] <i>Right, Laserhawk?</i>
- [Dolph] <i>I don't care.</i>

06:17.291 --> 06:18.666
[Jade] <i>Of course he doesn't care.</i>

06:18.666 --> 06:19.875
<i>Come on, you. Get out.</i>

06:19.875 --> 06:21.625
[Pey'j] <i>Oh, okay.</i>

06:24.500 --> 06:26.041
Wow. <i>Ah ouais, quand même.</i>

06:26.041 --> 06:28.291
[Pey'j] I know next to nothing
about wrestling.

06:28.291 --> 06:31.125
Why do I have to humiliate myself
like this?

06:31.125 --> 06:34.458
Well, because I can't do it,
she can't do it, and he won't do it.

06:34.458 --> 06:37.333
And the guy who was supposed to do it
is very, very dead.

06:37.333 --> 06:40.500
Oh, that poor Cody Rhodes dude.
What an ugly mess.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.791
Guys, do me a favor.

06:41.791 --> 06:44.250
If the Warden blows my head off,
please look away. [chuckles]

06:44.250 --> 06:45.916
[Pey'j] Hey, that's not funny.

06:45.916 --> 06:47.250
What? I mean, let's face it.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.625
Between Pagan Min
and Miss Maniac out there,

06:49.625 --> 06:52.125
our chances of survival are kinda slim.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.875
[Pey'j] Don't you say that again!

06:54.541 --> 06:56.958
I made a promise on your parents' grave

06:56.958 --> 06:59.791
that I would protect you
no matter what. And I will!

06:59.791 --> 07:02.041
[Jade] Hey, hey, hey.
All right. Calm down.

07:02.041 --> 07:05.916
You've always been there for me, Pey'j.
I know that. Okay?

07:05.916 --> 07:06.958
[Pey'j sighs]

07:06.958 --> 07:10.541
And you're right.
We've been in stickier situations before.

07:11.208 --> 07:14.541
We will get through this. Together.

07:15.208 --> 07:18.375
[Pey'j sighs] Yeah. Together.

07:19.041 --> 07:21.958
<i>Ghosts, you're taking off in five.</i>

07:21.958 --> 07:23.291
<i>Jade, where's your outfit?</i>

07:23.291 --> 07:24.208
My outfit...

07:24.208 --> 07:26.416
Oh yeah. I was thinking
I could go dressed like this.

07:26.416 --> 07:29.958
<i>You're not here to think, Jade.
You're here to follow orders.</i>

07:29.958 --> 07:33.833
<i>So I won't say it again.
Shut up and suit up.</i>

07:36.791 --> 07:40.333
[crowd chattering]

07:40.333 --> 07:42.625
I don't do femme fatale.

07:42.625 --> 07:47.208
I mean, I can pull off a lot of things,
but femme fatale? Fuck no.

07:47.208 --> 07:50.416
[Pey'j] Um... Well, I think you look good.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.500
Yeah, sure.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.375
- [Pey'j] Um, Jade?
- [Jade] Mmm?

07:56.875 --> 07:59.375
[Pey'j] I'm really sorry
about what happened back there.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.791
I-I think I just snapped

08:00.791 --> 08:03.791
because of the whole
bomb-in-our-heads thing and...

08:03.791 --> 08:04.708
I don't know.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.750
Oh, come on. It's all right.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.583
We've got a lot of reasons to be on edge.

08:08.583 --> 08:12.875
[Pey'j] Yeah. Yeah, sure.
But, uh... made me think.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.166
- Hmm? About what?
- [Pey'j sighs]

08:15.166 --> 08:17.791
[clicks tongue] I think...

08:18.375 --> 08:20.250
- I've got feelings for you.
- [Jade stammers]

08:20.875 --> 08:22.250
What? No.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.208
Oh. No! No, no! Oh, no, no, no!

08:24.208 --> 08:27.291
I mean, you're my uncle.
Not really my uncle, but still.

08:27.291 --> 08:29.875
- I mean, you? You? [stammers]
- [door, muffled] Guys! You're up!

08:29.875 --> 08:30.791
Ah, shit!

08:30.791 --> 08:33.666
Okay. Uh... Let's get on with the mission.

- Um... Hello?

08:44.125 --> 08:46.041
- Jade, you don't have to say hello.
- Oh. Okay.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.625
So, are you guys in position?

08:47.625 --> 08:49.833
Uh, yeah. I guess.

08:49.833 --> 08:53.583
So now use your talent to get us
a key card to the first security booth.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.916

about you, you know?

How you used to mob people
outside of gay bars in MegaCity 4,

14:09.750 --> 14:15.916
