00:39.920 --> 00:41.400
You going or not?

00:42.280 --> 00:44.680
First, you want to go out, then you don't.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.520
You want to pee, then you don't.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.320
Which is it?

01:03.440 --> 01:05.040
Okay. One last try.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.600
Here? Yes?

01:07.520 --> 01:08.360
Go on.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.480
Hello? Emergency services?

01:31.440 --> 01:34.640
I'm at Pont de l'Alma.
There's been a crash in the tunnel.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.400
I think it's serious.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.640
<i>Hello?</i>

09:57.640 --> 09:59.120
Where are you?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.200
<i>Paris.</i>

10:00.200 --> 10:04.440
Choosing fabrics and bedding
for the Malibu house.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.600
The wedding is in three weeks.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.080
It's our last chance.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.800
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.960
The greatest opportunity
in history opens up,

10:13.960 --> 10:15.280
and he's choosing fabrics.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.120
<i>I need you to come
to Saint-Tropez immediately.</i>

10:18.120 --> 10:21.880
<i>I have a special guest I need help with.</i>

10:21.880 --> 10:25.560
- What special guest?
- <i>You'll find out when you get here.</i>

10:26.760 --> 10:30.200
<i>But it's a very special guest.</i>

10:30.200 --> 10:31.120
<i>So come alone.</i>

10:31.120 --> 10:33.440
Don't bring Madame Bikini.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.440
Who?

10:34.440 --> 10:36.640
<i>The gold digger.</i>

10:36.640 --> 10:39.400
Leave her in Paris with her swimwear.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.440
Underwear. Fabrics. Pillowcases.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.480
Raise your hand, boy.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.640
What's going on?

19:15.640 --> 19:17.040
What is all this?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.760
Why am I here?

19:19.520 --> 19:20.680
My son.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.000
I would have thought
you would start with a "thank you."

19:26.640 --> 19:27.800
For what?

19:27.800 --> 19:31.640
For putting her on a plate for you.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.480
Who? What are you talking about?

20:07.160 --> 20:08.360
Wait!

20:10.080 --> 20:11.040
What is this?

20:12.040 --> 20:13.640
Are you out of your mind?

20:15.720 --> 20:17.800
This is the craziest idea I ever heard.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.800
Why?

20:21.280 --> 20:24.560
First, because I'm about to get married.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.720
Second, she's not
in the slightest bit interested in me.

20:29.720 --> 20:34.040
Then make her interested. Isn't that
what you've always been able to do?

20:34.040 --> 20:36.800
Make women fall in love with you.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.000
This is your chance!

20:39.000 --> 20:43.120
Your chance to finally make me
proud of you!
