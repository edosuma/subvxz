00:08.208 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
ONE MINUTE IN THE PRESENT
AND TEN MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:23.416 --> 00:25.375
-You disgust me.
-That's nice.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.583
-You only say things that hurt me.
-At least I talk. You don't.

00:28.666 --> 00:30.625
You act like everything is fine.

00:30.708 --> 00:33.458
-Fuck.
-Why won't you say it, Nico?

00:33.958 --> 00:36.583
Say that you don't love me anymore
and let's end this shit.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.583
-You're fucking immature.
-No, you are.

00:38.666 --> 00:41.125
You weren't loved as a child
and now I'm paying for it.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.541
Right, you love me.

00:42.625 --> 00:46.041
Is that why you're cheating?
Or are you looking for an excuse to split?

00:46.125 --> 00:49.583
Lina, maybe the person you fell
in love with doesn't exist anymore.

00:49.666 --> 00:52.125
I can't keep convincing you
this can be fixed.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.083
Nico, stop!

00:53.166 --> 00:54.291
Admit it.

00:55.416 --> 00:56.916
I need to hear it from you.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.291
What do you want me to say?

00:59.625 --> 01:01.000
That I don't love you anymore?

01:01.083 --> 01:03.833
That it's hard to be with you
because you make me feel like shit?

01:04.333 --> 01:07.041
That you made me waste
nine years of my life?

01:21.958 --> 01:22.791
Excuse me.

01:25.000 --> 01:25.833
Yes?

01:26.833 --> 01:28.166
Could I get a cup of coffee?

01:29.375 --> 01:30.208
Well…

01:34.166 --> 01:36.625
If it's too much trouble,
I can make it myself.

01:37.416 --> 01:39.958
You're in luck,
I haven't cleaned the machine yet.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.875
Otherwise, no way.

01:49.708 --> 01:52.083
How many dolphin cups went missing today?

01:52.166 --> 01:53.416
I don't know, a ton.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.291
People think they're pretty.
I don't get it.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.375
I'm thinking of taking one.

02:01.458 --> 02:02.541
Thanks.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.083
Need a hand?

02:19.041 --> 02:19.875
Let me help.

02:26.541 --> 02:27.583
What can I do?

02:27.666 --> 02:29.291
Well, hand me the trash.

02:30.833 --> 02:31.750
Thanks.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.333
-Is this trash?
-Yeah.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.291
This too?

02:40.416 --> 02:42.125
You always get up early, huh?

02:42.625 --> 02:43.458
Yeah.

02:44.041 --> 02:45.375
But the bar is never open.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.916
How many hours
do you spend underwater every day?

02:52.416 --> 02:53.375
About two.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
-Do you scuba dive?
-Me? No way.

02:59.208 --> 03:00.125
It scares me.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.208
What does?

03:01.916 --> 03:04.333
I don't know. Getting trapped down there.

03:04.916 --> 03:06.250
The silence.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.000
The emptiness.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.458
Hearing yourself breathe the whole time.

03:12.208 --> 03:13.250
You know?

03:13.833 --> 03:15.041
I know what you're afraid of.

03:16.791 --> 03:17.625
What?

03:18.208 --> 03:19.666
It happens to everyone.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.041
What?

03:21.125 --> 03:23.166
You're afraid
of getting the shitty wet suit.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.708
-The shitty wet suit.
-Yeah, the shitty one.

03:26.458 --> 03:27.416
The smelly one.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.875
The one someone peed in.

03:30.666 --> 03:31.833
What?

03:32.333 --> 03:34.416
Gross! Now I'm definitely not going.

03:34.916 --> 03:35.875
Hey, what's your name?

03:37.416 --> 03:38.250
Lina.

03:39.125 --> 03:41.000
I'm Nico. Nice to meet you.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.583
What size are you?

03:46.666 --> 03:47.500
Small?

03:50.333 --> 03:51.166
Yes.

03:51.250 --> 03:54.541
I swear I got a new, small-sized wet suit
yesterday.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.583
You'll be the first to wear it.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.250
Yeah.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.708
-These cups are nice.
-Don't you dare.

04:03.791 --> 04:05.291
Steal it some other time.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.583
How do you like working the night shift?

04:12.541 --> 04:13.416
It's fine.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.416
I'm out of sync with everyone,
but you get used to it eventually.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.208
What about you?

04:20.791 --> 04:23.291
I hate waking up when it's still dark out.

04:23.375 --> 04:24.416
I'm the opposite.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.291
I rush to bed before the sun rises.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.208
But today you're going diving.

04:30.291 --> 04:31.708
I'm not going to scuba dive.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.125
I can't fall sleep after the sun rises.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.666
Want to have breakfast?

04:41.458 --> 04:42.291
Sure.

04:42.958 --> 04:43.833
Come with me.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.291
-Won't we get caught?
-No.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.833
No one comes in until six.

05:02.916 --> 05:05.041
Here's some Jell-O, yogurt…

05:05.125 --> 05:06.291
I'm getting juice.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.208
This one's delicious. It's new.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.083
Help yourself.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.000
Well…

05:15.791 --> 05:16.625
Okay.

05:35.208 --> 05:37.208
-I'll have some cereal.
-Okay.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.625
I love chocolate sauce.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.083
And all I wanted was some coffee.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.041
Surprise.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.875
Do you do this every day?

06:01.916 --> 06:02.750
Yeah.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.041
I have breakfast before bed.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.250
That's worse than stealing a cup.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.208
Would you vacation at this hotel?

06:21.041 --> 06:23.333
Not in my room.
It overlooks the parking lot.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.750
Well, at least you're here.

06:26.625 --> 06:29.041
I'm in the apartments
on the other side of the beach.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.416
-I have five roommates.
-Whoa.

06:34.416 --> 06:37.166
The suite with a terrace.
The one with the fish tank.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.375
I'd stay there.

06:44.958 --> 06:46.208
Hey, I have to get going.

06:47.916 --> 06:49.916
I'll come with you, it's on my way.

06:50.666 --> 06:51.500
Cool.

06:54.708 --> 06:55.916
Are you from the island?

06:57.041 --> 06:59.208
No one is from here in the summer.

06:59.916 --> 07:03.083
-Where are you from?
-I'm from a town on the coast of Valencia.

07:04.666 --> 07:08.708
I came here to make some money and…
then study nursing, I guess.

07:09.208 --> 07:10.041
You guess?

07:10.541 --> 07:12.375
Yeah, I don't know for sure yet.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.625
-Right.
-I have to get accepted first.

07:17.083 --> 07:17.916
What about you?

07:18.750 --> 07:19.708
I'm a biologist.

07:20.291 --> 07:21.666
Well, I just got my degree.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.083
I should be finishing economics.

07:25.583 --> 07:26.958
-Economics?
-Yes.

07:27.041 --> 07:27.875
Wow.

07:27.958 --> 07:30.125
Yes. But I quit because

07:30.791 --> 07:31.916
it wasn't for me.

07:32.875 --> 07:35.291
I didn't want to do anything
I wasn't sure about.

07:35.791 --> 07:36.666
Of course.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.333
That makes sense.

07:42.208 --> 07:43.375
And why scuba diving?

07:44.666 --> 07:48.666
Well, I've been interested in the sea,
fish, and diving since I was a kid.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.625
It started as a hobby,
and now I get paid for it.

07:56.583 --> 07:57.541
Where are you from?

07:58.458 --> 07:59.750
I grew up in Zaragoza.

08:00.375 --> 08:01.791
But there's no ocean there.

08:02.541 --> 08:04.750
I wasn't doing much with my life there.

08:07.708 --> 08:09.125
So, got any plans?

08:09.208 --> 08:12.250
Well, I'll finish this season,
and then we'll see.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.166
Okay, all done.

08:23.750 --> 08:24.583
My buddy

08:25.250 --> 08:26.750
can load these onto the boat.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.250
-Have you ever been to the pier?
-No.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.625
-Let's go.
-Okay.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.791
Any problems with your ears?

08:38.500 --> 08:39.458
What?

08:39.541 --> 08:42.166
Do they hurt when the air pressure changes

08:42.250 --> 08:44.916
or when you're on a plane
or climbing a mountain?

08:45.500 --> 08:46.958
-No.
-Okay.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.541
Any respiratory issues?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.208
-Asthma, bronchitis, sinusitis, anything?
-No.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.291
Do you smoke?

08:53.375 --> 08:54.208
-No.
-Good.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.958
Have you ever had any heart issues?

08:58.166 --> 08:59.291
No.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.750
We've finished the survey.
You're ready to dive.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.708
-No, I mean it. I'm not going to dive.
-Hey…

09:05.375 --> 09:06.208
Hang on.

09:22.083 --> 09:22.916
Here it is.

09:23.416 --> 09:24.916
The one that smells brand new.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.666
-It's all yours.
-All right.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.833
How's it going?

09:57.458 --> 09:58.291
Fine.

10:01.416 --> 10:02.625
I think it's stuck.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.625
-Need some help?
-I need help, yeah.

10:06.208 --> 10:07.416
-May I?
-I can't…

10:07.500 --> 10:08.708
-Of course.
-Let's see.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.125
Okay.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.250
Your arm goes here.

10:13.541 --> 10:14.416
Good job.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.416
-Wait.
-The other arm… in here.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.583
-Great.
-My hair.

10:18.666 --> 10:19.875
-Your hair.
-My hair.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.041
That's important.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.291
-Done.
-Okay.

10:23.291 --> 10:24.125
And…

10:25.625 --> 10:26.666
-That's it.
-Yes.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.375
You won't be able to fall asleep.

10:34.958 --> 10:35.875
You're right.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.375
Great.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.458
So it's over.

11:19.541 --> 11:21.166
I wish we'd never met.

12:43.875 --> 12:47.833
THIS SERIES IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ANY SIMILARITY IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.
