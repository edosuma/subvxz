01:16.600 --> 01:18.166
- Hey, Leela.
- Hey, Leela.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.700
Hey, Chris. Hi, guys.

01:19.700 --> 01:20.734
- Hi, Leela!
- Hi, Leela!

01:20.734 --> 01:22.533
Hello. And hello to you.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.033
Welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.433
Hi!

01:25.433 --> 01:26.767
- Yes, please.

01:26.767 --> 01:30.166
Wow! Look at
all this awesome stuff.

01:30.166 --> 01:32.700
- Yeah.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.934
Uh, I'm making
a bracelet, Zoe.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.266
How come?

01:35.266 --> 01:38.133
Today is a holiday
in India, Telly.

01:38.133 --> 01:40.834
It's called Rakhi,
and it's a special day
when sisters

01:40.834 --> 01:43.667
show their brothers how much
they love and appreciate them

01:43.667 --> 01:45.166
by making them
special bracelets.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.734
Well, what
about the sisters?

01:46.734 --> 01:49.266
Oh. Well, the brothers
give their sisters gifts,
too.

01:49.266 --> 01:50.734
- Oh.
- My brother Sunil,

01:50.734 --> 01:52.700
he lives back in India,
and this year,

01:52.700 --> 01:54.533
he's making me a bracelet.

01:54.533 --> 01:55.567
Oh.

01:55.567 --> 01:57.900
Hey. You know, maybe
we should have a--

01:57.900 --> 02:00.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Leela, you said
your brother Sunil

02:00.867 --> 02:04.200
lives in India,
and that's really, really
far away, right?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.767
- Right.
- And you also said

02:05.767 --> 02:08.400
that Rakhi was today,
right?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.433
- Right.
- So even if you mail

02:10.433 --> 02:13.333
that bracelet right
this minute, there's no way

02:13.333 --> 02:15.834
your brother could get it
before Rakhi was over.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.433
He's gonna feel
terrible, horrible!

02:18.433 --> 02:21.033
He's gonna think you don't
love and appreciate him!

02:21.033 --> 02:23.133
Telly, Telly,
it's all right!

02:23.133 --> 02:24.867
It is

02:24.867 --> 02:27.700
Well, I sent Sunil's
bracelet weeks ago.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.233
- He's already called
and said that he's gotten it.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.900
What about the bracelet
he's making for you?

02:32.900 --> 02:35.133
Did you get that bracelet yet?

02:35.133 --> 02:38.867
Well, no, not yet, but, uh,

02:38.867 --> 02:41.667
you know, some brothers can
be a little disorganized.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.166
But it's OK.
He promised me
that he sent it

02:44.166 --> 02:45.633
so that it would
definitely arrive.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.233
Mailman:
Special de-livery!

02:48.233 --> 02:50.100
Package for Leela
at the laundromat.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.400
Leela, Leela, that must
be your brother's bracelet!

02:52.400 --> 02:55.700
You see?
I knew Sunil would
come through.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.433
- Yeah.
- So, sign, please.

02:58.433 --> 03:00.500
- This is exciting.
- Yeah.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.834
Thank you very much.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.967
- Open it up!
- Yeah. Let's see, let's see

03:03.967 --> 03:06.667
if there's lots
and lots of beads on it.

03:06.667 --> 03:07.667
Yes.
Let's look at it.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.300
What color do you
think it is, Telly?

03:09.300 --> 03:12.700
That's a funny-looking
bracelet, Leela.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.266
That's because it's
not a bracelet, Zoe.

03:14.266 --> 03:17.533
It's a sample box
of laundry detergent.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.400
- Oh.
- But that's OK.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.100
It's early yet.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.400
Plenty of time
for more deliveries.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.667
Um, hey, listen.
Can I ask you
a question?

03:26.667 --> 03:28.533
- Mm-hmm.
- If you've already made

03:28.533 --> 03:30.400
a bracelet for
your brother Sunil,

03:30.400 --> 03:31.700
who's that one for?

03:31.700 --> 03:34.033
Sometimes on Rakhi,
we give bracelets
to good friends

03:34.033 --> 03:36.033
we think of as brothers,
even if they're not

03:36.033 --> 03:37.100
actually brothers.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.333
Wait a minute--

03:38.333 --> 03:41.066
You mean that I could make
a Rakhi bracelet and give it

03:41.066 --> 03:43.867
to someone who I think
of as a brother?

03:43.867 --> 03:46.567
I mean, someone like
my good buddy, Baby Bear?

03:46.567 --> 03:48.967
- Absolutely.
- Oh, oh, ooh!

03:48.967 --> 03:53.533
And, Leela, I could
make two bracelets,
one for my real brother Joey

03:53.533 --> 03:56.233
and one for
my almost-real
brother Rocco?

03:56.233 --> 03:57.533
Absolutely.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.233
Would you help
us make them?

03:59.233 --> 04:01.900
Yeah, please!
A Rakhi bracelet
for Rocco!

04:01.900 --> 04:03.233
- Absolutely.
- All right!

04:03.233 --> 04:05.166
You guys have fun,
and I'll see you later.

04:05.166 --> 04:06.166
- Thanks for the shirts.
- See you, Chris.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.433
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

04:07.433 --> 04:09.900
- I think I want, um, green.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.567
Let's see.
I twist the blue thread

04:14.567 --> 04:16.200
with the yellow thread.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.133
Oh, hi, Chris.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.734
Hey, Elmo.

04:20.734 --> 04:22.100
What is Chris doing?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.867
Oh. Um. I was trying
to make a bracelet.

04:24.867 --> 04:26.033
A bracelet?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.800
Yeah, buddy, but not
just any old bracelet.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.500
See, this one's
a special bracelet.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.400
- I'm making it for Leela.
- Oh.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.834
See, today is
an Indian holiday
called Rakhi,

04:33.834 --> 04:35.734
and in Rakhi,

04:35.734 --> 04:37.266
brothers and sisters
give each other bracelets

04:37.266 --> 04:38.700
to show how much
they care for each other.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.367
Wow! Elmo didn't know
Leela was Chris's sister.

04:42.367 --> 04:46.100
Oh, Elmo, she isn't,
but I like to think
of her as as a sister,

04:46.100 --> 04:47.800
so I figured I'd
make her a bracelet

04:47.800 --> 04:49.500
to, I don't know,
cheer her up.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.333
Leela needs
to be cheered up?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.700
I get the feeling
that Leela's

04:52.700 --> 04:54.867
a little homesick
for the things
back in India.

04:54.867 --> 04:56.967
Well, maybe Chris
and Elmo should do more

04:56.967 --> 04:59.500
than just make
Leela a bracelet.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.400
That is
an excellent idea.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.967
Leela, look.
How does this look?

05:04.967 --> 05:06.967
Ooh! It's lovely, Zoe.

05:06.967 --> 05:08.200
Thank you!

05:08.200 --> 05:09.700
How about this?

05:09.700 --> 05:12.400
I'll bet Baby Bear's gonna
love this Rakhi bracelet.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.033
I'm sure he will,
Telly.

05:14.033 --> 05:15.867
Mailman :
Special de-livery!

05:15.867 --> 05:17.333
Delivery!
It's your bracelet!

05:17.333 --> 05:19.567
Package for Leela
at the laundromat.

05:19.567 --> 05:21.800
Just make sure
you sign, please.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.033
- Thank you!
- Is it, is it-- Hurry up!

05:25.033 --> 05:26.934
Oh, boy!
Is it the bracelet?

05:26.934 --> 05:29.333
Feather light
fabric softener.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.100
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.633
Oh, ho ho ho! Look at all
the special foods

05:33.633 --> 05:35.934
that Chris made for Leela.

05:35.934 --> 05:37.667
Yeah, buddy,
and I couldn't
have done it

05:37.667 --> 05:39.533
- without your help.
- Aw. Hee hee!

05:39.533 --> 05:41.934
Well, your help
and the help of this
wonderful Indian cookbook

05:41.934 --> 05:43.700
I found
on the Internet.

05:43.700 --> 05:44.934
Say the names
again, Chris.

05:44.934 --> 05:46.767
Elmo likes
to hear the names.

05:46.767 --> 05:50.467
Chris: This is a special Indian
rice pudding called phirni.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.166
- Phirni.
- Yeah.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.667
This is called carrot halwa.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.767
- Carrot halwa.
- Carrot halwa.

05:56.767 --> 05:59.900
And this is a choco-fruit curd
that kind of looks

05:59.900 --> 06:01.700
like my grandmother's
pecan pie.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.200
- Mm-hmm. It sure does.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.000
And this is called laddu.
Let's see.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.433
According to this recipe,
we're not quite finished yet.

06:09.433 --> 06:10.567
It's not ready yet.

06:10.567 --> 06:13.233
Elmo doesn't know
what a recipe is.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.166
It's a list
of steps, buddy.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.467
It tells you all
the ingredients

06:16.467 --> 06:17.467
you need to make something.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.700
In order to finish
off our laddu...

06:19.700 --> 06:21.033
Laddu, laddu, laddu!

06:21.033 --> 06:22.433
Yeah. I know
you like that one.

06:22.433 --> 06:25.567
We need to top these little
desserts with pistachios.

06:25.567 --> 06:28.133
Chris and Elmo did a bad job
following the recipe.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.433
What do you mean, buddy?

06:29.433 --> 06:32.533
Well, Chris and Elmo
don't have any pistachios.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.800
Special de-livery!

06:34.800 --> 06:36.033
Don't be so sure.

06:36.033 --> 06:37.800
Package for Chris
at Hooper's Store.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.066
That would be me.
I'll take that.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.266
All right.
There you go.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.567
- Thank you, and thank you.
- Sign, please.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.000
I will do. OK.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.233
Those look delicious.

06:44.233 --> 06:45.800
OK. Thank you, sir.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
Ah. Thank you.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.800
OK. Have a good one.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
- All right.
- Thank you.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.467
OK. Let's see.
What do we got here?

06:50.467 --> 06:53.900
- Oh, ho ho ho! Pistachios!
- Yeah, buddy.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.533
Chris did follow
the recipe!

06:55.533 --> 06:58.133
Absolutely. Now all we
have to do is take--ahh--

06:58.133 --> 07:01.433
some of these and put one
on each of our laddu.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.600
Laddu, laddu, laddu!

07:03.600 --> 07:07.133
This is starting to look
like a real Indian party.

07:07.133 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, looking like one maybe,
but not really sounding

07:11.000 --> 07:13.734
like one yet. Hmm.

07:16.133 --> 07:20.133
Mmm. I can't find any
Indian music on the radio,
buddy.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.333
Guess we're gonna have
to bring in our own.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.367
All right, that's it.
Time to close.

07:27.367 --> 07:30.000
Maybe it will
come tomorrow.

07:32.567 --> 07:33.633
Do you guys
hear something?

07:33.633 --> 07:35.333
- Yeah.
- No.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.867
I don't know what it is,
but it sounds like it's coming

07:38.867 --> 07:40.300
from Hooper's Store.

07:41.734 --> 07:45.200
- Elmo: Ha ha ha!

07:48.200 --> 07:50.533
- Whoa! Hey, hey.
- Yay!

07:50.533 --> 07:51.967
Come on in, Come on in.

07:51.967 --> 07:52.967
Oh, wow!

07:52.967 --> 07:54.433
What happened
in here?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.967
Well, I figured since you
couldn't be with your brother

07:56.967 --> 08:00.033
in India, I'd bring a little
bit of India here, huh?

08:00.033 --> 08:01.233
Ooh! And Elmo helped!

08:01.233 --> 08:03.133
You sure did, buddy!

08:03.133 --> 08:06.500
Oh, hey. Remember when
you said that, for Rakhi,

08:06.500 --> 08:08.233
good friends who aren't
brothers and sisters,

08:08.233 --> 08:10.200
but kinda-sorta feel
like they are brothers
and sisters,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.734
can exchange Rakhi
bracelets, too?

08:11.734 --> 08:12.867
Mm-hmm.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.233
OK. Keeping that
in mind...

08:15.233 --> 08:17.533
this is for you, huh?

08:17.533 --> 08:20.133
- Pretty.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.934
This is so funny.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.467
Funny?

08:23.467 --> 08:25.467
You know the Rakhi bracelet
I was making before

08:25.467 --> 08:27.066
when you first came
to the laundromat?

08:27.066 --> 08:29.100
Yeah.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.900
It's for you.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.467
No. For real?

08:32.467 --> 08:33.967
Come here.
Thank you.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.367
- Special de-livery!
- Oh.

08:35.367 --> 08:37.533
Did Chris order
something else?

08:37.533 --> 08:39.967
I'm looking for Leela
from the laundromat.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.000
Oh, I'm here!

Ooh, and Elmo wants
to learn more about them.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.233
You know what to do.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.333
Let's ask Smartie.

Yeah, baby!

21:18.967 --> 21:20.500
Oh, that's perfect,

21:20.500 --> 21:24.100
because Elmo wants
to learn all about
celebrations today.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.967
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:26.967 --> 21:30.400
Both:
We look it up!

21:30.400 --> 21:33.266
Searching "celebrations."

21:33.266 --> 21:35.734
Celebrations are
a fun way to enjoy

21:35.734 --> 21:37.567
all kinds of special occasions,

21:37.567 --> 21:41.166
like birthdays
or winning a big game.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.500
There are celebrations
for holidays, too,

21:43.500 --> 21:48.367
like Fourth of July,
Halloween, or Christmas.

21:48.367 --> 21:50.533
Sometimes people wear
special clothes

21:50.533 --> 21:52.433
and make special food.

21:52.433 --> 21:55.834
People have celebrations
all over the world--

21:55.834 --> 22:00.166
Carnival, Ramadan,
and Yi Peng Lantern Festival.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.633
They really light me up!

Elmo wants to celebrate
having so many nice friends.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.834
Oh, especially you,
Smartie.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.500
- Aww!
- Ha ha ha!

22:10.500 --> 22:12.967
- Me, too, Elmo.
- Yeah.

22:12.967 --> 22:15.667
Gotta boogie! We're having
a birthday celebration

22:15.667 --> 22:18.533
for my great-great-
grandfather, Crank.

22:18.533 --> 22:19.934
Ah ha ha ha!

22:19.934 --> 22:21.734
See you later,
Elmo.

22:21.734 --> 22:24.200
Bye-bye, Smartie.
Have fun.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.266
Boy, Elmo's learning so much
about celebrations.

22:28.266 --> 22:31.967
Hey! That gives Elmo
an idea.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.734
Oh, come on, let's play
a game together.

22:34.734 --> 22:36.400
Yeah! Come on, come on.

22:41.533 --> 22:45.300
There are party hats,
but one is missing.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.633
Come on, let's finish
the pattern.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.400
Are you ready?
Let's play.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.867
Elmo wonders
which hat goes here.

22:53.867 --> 22:55.200
Let's see.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.600
There's a hat with stripes

22:56.600 --> 22:58.367
and a hat with polka dots

22:58.367 --> 23:00.400
and stripes and polka dots,

23:00.400 --> 23:01.500
stripes.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.133
Which one of these hats
comes next?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.200
This one?

23:05.200 --> 23:07.500
Child:
No! That's not it.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.066
Child 2:
That hat has zigzags.

23:09.066 --> 23:11.300
Oh, get out
of here, hat.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.900
So which hat really
goes here?

23:13.900 --> 23:15.166
Child 3:
The polka dot one.

23:15.166 --> 23:17.066
OK, let's see
what we got.

23:17.066 --> 23:19.967
Stripes, polka dots, stripes,

23:19.967 --> 23:23.233
polka dots, stripes,
polka dots.

23:23.233 --> 23:25.333
Yay! We did it.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.967
We finished the pattern.

23:26.967 --> 23:29.967
Boy, Elmo loves celebrating.

23:29.967 --> 23:33.934
Oh, and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:33.934 --> 23:36.734
Oh, does Mr. Noodle
celebrate anything?

23:36.734 --> 23:39.567
Oh, oh, let's ask him.
Ha ha ha!

Elmo was wondering,

23:47.633 --> 23:50.400
do you celebrate anything?

23:50.400 --> 23:54.166
You do? Oh! Show us how
you celebrate, Mr. Noodle.

Child: That's not how you
celebrate, Mr. Noodle.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.400
Child 2:
He's swimming.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.734
Elmo: Some celebrations
have decorations.

24:07.133 --> 24:11.033
Ha ha ha!
He decorated himself!

24:11.033 --> 24:12.767
Oh, Mr. Noodle!

24:12.767 --> 24:16.967
A celebration isn't when
you decorate yourself.

24:16.967 --> 24:19.700
No, it's when you throw
a party for something.

24:20.767 --> 24:23.500
Child:
Try again, Mr. Noodle.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.133
Children :
He's having a celebration.
