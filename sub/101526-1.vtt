(GRUNTING)

55:39.044 --> 55:40.921
JONATHAN TROPPER: <i>When we see</i>
<i>Ah Sahm in the opening</i>
<i>of this season,</i>

55:41.004 --> 55:43.298
<i>he's fighting in this</i>
<i>Barbary Coast fight pit.</i>

55:43.382 --> 55:45.676
We were really excited to build
the Barbary Coast.

55:45.759 --> 55:48.303
<i>It just seemed like this great,</i>
<i>lawless place,</i>

55:48.387 --> 55:50.639
and it gave us a chance
to really expand our world.

55:50.722 --> 55:51.890
(CLAMORING)

55:51.974 --> 55:53.642
He just kept going back
to the fight pit,

55:53.976 --> 55:56.979
<i>'cause he was trying to relive</i>
<i>the moment with Li Yong,</i>

55:57.062 --> 56:00.566
or to vent his emotions
because of what happened
with his sister.

56:00.649 --> 56:03.235
I couldn't quite figure out
the exact reason.

56:03.318 --> 56:05.320
ROSALITA VEGA:
What's a China Town
hatchet man doing

56:05.404 --> 56:08.240
in a Barbary Coast fight pit?
What are you looking for?

56:08.949 --> 56:09.866
Just staying sharp.

56:10.325 --> 56:12.828
Rosalita Vega has been running
this fight club in the bottom

56:12.911 --> 56:14.329
of a landlocked boat.

56:14.413 --> 56:18.667
She's tough, she's crafty,
and she's got her eye
on Ah Sahm,

56:18.750 --> 56:20.419
<i>for reasons we don't quite know</i>
<i>yet.</i>

56:20.502 --> 56:22.129
When she first sees Ah Sahm,

56:22.212 --> 56:23.672
<i>she's not sure</i>
<i>what to expect.</i>

56:23.755 --> 56:25.966
There's a curiosity of,
"Who is this guy?"

56:26.049 --> 56:27.676
(YELLING, GRUNTING)

56:27.759 --> 56:30.387
MARIA‐ELENA LAAS:
<i>"And what does he have</i>
<i>to show?"</i>

56:30.470 --> 56:32.723
He sees Vega as somewhat
of a kindred spirit.

56:32.806 --> 56:36.059
<i>We're from similar backgrounds,</i>
<i>and we've got similar stories,</i>

56:36.143 --> 56:37.436
so there's attraction.

56:38.854 --> 56:40.564
JOANNA VANDERHAM:
<i>When we meet Penny</i>
<i>in season two,</i>

56:40.772 --> 56:44.026
she's very much in the thick
of running the family business
for Mercer Steel.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.777
I did my best to be supportive,

56:45.861 --> 56:49.865
but now the mayor's wife
has a hundred coolies
working for her.

56:49.948 --> 56:52.200
Do you understand
the position you're putting
me in?

56:52.284 --> 56:56.204
The thorn in the side of that
is the Irish thugs.

56:56.288 --> 56:59.124
They resent the fact
that she's hiring Chinese labor.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.877
Mercer Steel
is my father's legacy.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.045
Just sell the damn thing!

57:03.128 --> 57:04.588
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

57:04.671 --> 57:06.673
We meet Sophie in the first
episode of season two.

57:06.757 --> 57:08.342
She's moved in with me
and Blake.

57:08.425 --> 57:11.178
So, Sophie is Penny Blake's
younger sister.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.805
She's got a rebellious streak,
and she's very outgoing.

57:13.889 --> 57:16.975
<i>So I think when she first sees</i>
<i>Leary in the cemetery,</i>

57:17.059 --> 57:18.810
she is genuinely curious.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.062
You don't strike me as a man

57:20.145 --> 57:22.272
who spends a lot of time
among proper women.

57:22.356 --> 57:23.899
You're quick to judge,
aren't ya?

57:24.107 --> 57:26.109
It isn't until he starts

57:26.193 --> 57:29.488
making assumptions about her
that it becomes a bit more

57:29.571 --> 57:33.200
<i>playful and flirtatious</i>
<i>between them. She's intrigued,</i>

57:33.283 --> 57:35.869
because she's never met anyone
like Leary before.

57:36.578 --> 57:39.998
As a loyal American,
I sentence you to death.

57:40.082 --> 57:43.085
‐Who the fuck are you?
‐That's not important right now.

57:43.168 --> 57:45.045
(ALL YELLING, GRUNTING)

57:46.171 --> 57:47.506
So, at the beginning
of season two,

57:47.589 --> 57:52.219
we see Ah Toy and Ah Sahm
team up to fight the Teddy Boys.

57:52.302 --> 57:56.181
So we see what ruthless
vigilantes they make.

57:56.556 --> 57:58.892
Ah Toy has always sort of
picked her moments

57:58.975 --> 58:01.478
to really strike on behalf
of the Chinese people.

58:01.561 --> 58:03.689
She's been a quiet vigilante
for years.

58:03.772 --> 58:05.190
We've been too active lately.

58:05.273 --> 58:07.943
Leave them alone, tomorrow
they take another Chinese scalp.

58:08.026 --> 58:10.153
And if we keep leaving a trail
of dead white people,

58:10.237 --> 58:12.739
we'll become a threat
to ourselves and China Town.

58:12.823 --> 58:14.783
Unlike Ah Toy, Ah Sahm
isn't as wise

58:14.866 --> 58:17.411
about knowing when to lay low
and when to strike.

58:17.494 --> 58:19.788
<i>He sort of becomes addicted</i>
<i>to the vengeance of it.</i>

58:19.871 --> 58:21.456
<i>Now that Ah Sahm</i>
<i>is doing it with her,</i>

58:21.540 --> 58:22.999
the stakes have
kind of gotten bigger

58:23.083 --> 58:25.502
because it's bringing more heat
onto China Town,

58:25.585 --> 58:27.379
<i>and it's bringing more</i>
<i>police attention.</i>

58:28.046 --> 58:29.631
If you and your squad
can't find me

58:29.715 --> 58:32.008
at least one fucking swordsman,
I'll get someone who can.

58:32.092 --> 58:36.179
We pick up Bill, and he's still
got the pressure from Flanagan

58:36.263 --> 58:37.639
<i>to find the swordsman.</i>

58:37.723 --> 58:41.476
Lee's become so obsessed
with this pursuit
of the swordsman,

58:41.560 --> 58:44.312
he's trying to get
any information he can,

58:44.396 --> 58:45.939
<i>in a very dogged way.</i>

58:46.022 --> 58:49.317
And outside of that, he's using
laudanum to dull the pain

58:49.401 --> 58:51.820
and the anxiety
from his head injury.

58:51.903 --> 58:53.530
A lot of Lee's negative
qualities

58:53.613 --> 58:55.198
<i>have kind of been dialed up</i>
<i>to 11.</i>

58:57.576 --> 58:59.327
The introduction of Mai Ling
in season two

58:59.411 --> 59:03.415
was me walking down
the China Town streets
like the new queen.

59:03.915 --> 59:05.500
‐I'll take it all.
‐What?

59:05.876 --> 59:07.711
All of it.
Everything in the stand.

59:08.086 --> 59:10.422
DIANNE DOAN:
<i>It's important for me</i>
<i>to interact with my people.</i>

59:10.505 --> 59:13.008
I want to be accepted
and loved,

59:13.091 --> 59:15.302
and throughout the season
you'll see Mai Ling

59:15.385 --> 59:16.762
establishing her power
even more.

59:17.012 --> 59:19.931
Mai Ling's walking around like
the motherfucking queen
of China Town.

59:20.265 --> 59:21.683
The Fung Hai are all over us,

59:21.767 --> 59:24.102
which never would have happened
if we hadn't bent over for them.

59:24.186 --> 59:25.270
Father Jun and Young Jun,

59:25.353 --> 59:27.481
they're kind of like yin
and yang. Oil and water.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.941
Young Jun's saying Father Jun's
getting old.

59:30.150 --> 59:32.319
He's not able to make good
decisions for the Hop Wei.

59:32.903 --> 59:35.697
Young Jun clearly feels
that the Hop Wei

59:35.781 --> 59:38.074
have the power and the numbers
to solve

59:38.158 --> 59:41.453
the territorial dispute,
whereas Father Jun

59:41.536 --> 59:47.042
is older, wiser, and wants
a much more nuanced approach.

59:47.125 --> 59:49.878
The Hop Wei are going through
some growing pains right now.

59:49.961 --> 59:52.714
Young Jun and Ah Sam
are really upset with Father Jun

59:52.798 --> 59:55.675
for giving Mai Ling entrée
into the opium trade

59:55.759 --> 59:57.636
and they feel they've shown
real weakness.

59:57.719 --> 1:00:00.180
<i>They're full of vim and vigor.</i>
<i>They wanna take over.</i>

1:00:00.388 --> 1:00:02.974
We lost a lot of chop
by cutting Mai Ling in.

1:00:03.225 --> 1:00:05.685
We could offset some of that
if we stopped importing.

1:00:05.977 --> 1:00:07.604
Father Jun
doesn't have to know about it.

1:00:07.687 --> 1:00:09.856
We need to locate a source
we can trust.

1:00:10.857 --> 1:00:12.108
So we'll find one.
