Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.199 --> 00:12.140
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.060
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.039
They were good.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.050
[theme music]

00:22.179 --> 00:26.179
Then, there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.199 --> 00:28.030
He was bad.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.100
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.190 --> 00:34.070
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.090 --> 00:36.189

I ever do!

00:38.210 --> 00:39.210
Unh!

00:39.229 --> 00:41.140
Oh! I'll get you!

00:41.159 --> 00:44.229
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:45.009 --> 00:47.079
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.100 --> 00:51.109
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.130 --> 00:55.170
And if you are good,
you may just catch a glimpse..

00:55.189 --> 00:57.070

Now what will I do?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.159
My special mirror.

01:48.090 --> 01:50.099
Ah, good old reliable.

is about to happen very soon.

the worst bad luck.

for no reason, and--

That's it!

the beginning.

02:40.069 --> 02:42.199

hundredth Smurf we've got.

- It's your fault, Vanity Smurf.

Our only chance of preventing
a hundred years of bad luck

is to teach
the hundredth Smurf

Uh, h-he went away.

11:16.159 --> 11:18.149
What?

11:18.169 --> 11:20.190
Bad luck again, Papa Smurf.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.019
It's going to get worse.

11:22.039 --> 11:24.049
Search the village.
Search the forest.

11:24.070 --> 11:26.139

must be found.

and animals are leaving.

Oh, no. Look at my new mirror.
That's the worst luck yet.

12:01.129 --> 12:04.120
Gee, I'm sorry, Vanity.
I didn't mean to--

12:04.139 --> 12:06.039
Hey. You can talk.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.090
He's normal. He can talk.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.059
Then that means
he can dance too.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.110
Quickly,
back to the village.

12:12.129 --> 12:15.029

12:15.049 --> 12:17.179
[theme music]

12:19.139 --> 12:22.070
No more bad luck now, right,
Papa Smurf?

12:22.090 --> 12:24.009
Not anymore, Smurfette.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.019
[both gasp]

12:27.039 --> 12:30.070
Oh, no. It can't be.
Not another double.

12:30.090 --> 12:32.000
Yes, it can. I mean..

12:32.019 --> 12:34.149
[babbling]

12:34.169 --> 12:36.019
(Jokey)
'Ouch!'

12:36.039 --> 12:39.000
Papa Smurf has no
sense of humor!

12:39.019 --> 12:40.029
[thud]

12:42.090 --> 12:43.129
Alright.

12:43.149 --> 12:47.120
Let the Dance
of the Hundred Smurfs begin.

12:47.139 --> 12:51.220
One, two. Left, right.
One, two. One, two.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.009
All together, smurf left.
