are being cursed to

do what exactly?

10:16.485 --> 10:18.618
Right.
Stop talking.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.751
It's okay to be worried.
I'm worried, too.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.326
I'm sorry, how much longer
is this gonna take?

10:31.413 --> 10:32.980
The book is infinite.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.200
Is there an index?

10:36.287 --> 10:37.941
There aren't even
page numbers.

10:44.252 --> 10:47.472
Ah, here it is.
The last recipe
they said they cooked,

10:47.559 --> 10:49.736
Preserve A Memory
Fruit Preserves.

10:49.823 --> 10:54.044
"Make room in your mind
to remember for all time."

10:54.131 --> 10:55.829
I'm not really
a riddle person.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.657
To ensure they
remember magic,

10:57.744 --> 10:59.659
they had to
forget something.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.443
So they chose
their friendship?

11:01.530 --> 11:02.705
Not on purpose.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.839
This book can be...
tricky.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.797
Ah, there's another part
of the riddle.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.886
You can barely see it.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.540
That is tricky.

11:11.627 --> 11:16.937
"To remember what you can
no longer recall,

11:17.024 --> 11:21.637
"go back to the beginning,
the start of it all.

11:21.724 --> 11:26.163
"Build it up,
brick by brick,

11:26.250 --> 11:30.428
"don't miss a piece,
that's the trick."

11:33.388 --> 11:34.824
I think we need to
reconstruct

11:34.911 --> 11:37.348
the exact moment
the girls became friends

11:37.435 --> 11:39.699
so they can become
friends again.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.439
Because that
won't be hard at all.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.312
The girls had a fight?

11:44.399 --> 11:46.793
It's bad. They're not
talking to each other.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.272
Oh, poor Kelly.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.798
I was thinking.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.582
It would be nice
to remind them

11:53.669 --> 11:55.018
of when they
became friends.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.977
Like the actual moment.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.761
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.807
You were there,
weren't you?

12:00.894 --> 12:03.723
Yes, but shouldn't we
just encourage them to
talk it out?

12:03.810 --> 12:07.117
No. I know them.
They're sentimental.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.685
Reminding them of
how they met and
became friends

12:09.772 --> 12:11.687
would make them
forget their fight.

12:13.558 --> 12:14.516
Okay.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.912
Kelly had just won
the spelling bee.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.262
- Honey, I'm just
so proud of you.
- Thanks.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.829
She spelled obsequious.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.265
I mean, I barely know
what that means.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.875
I like to spell.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.486
Oh, I think that's
our food.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.531
I'll go get it.

12:32.316 --> 12:35.145
People were so impressed.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.974
- Congratulations, Kelly.
- Thank you.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.759
And that's when
I noticed Darbie
walking backwards.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.936
She was moon walking
or something.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.328
She bumped
right into Kelly.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.590
[clattering]

12:45.677 --> 12:47.636
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.856
You got waffle fries?
Nice.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.293
And then Hannah
came out of nowhere.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.860
I have a clean shirt
for you.

12:53.947 --> 12:54.904
Thank you.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.906
[indistinct]

12:56.993 --> 12:59.779
And before I knew it,
the three of them were
just laughing,

12:59.866 --> 13:02.085
and going on like they'd
been friends forever.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.828
That's it?
How did Hannah get there?

13:05.915 --> 13:07.569
I think I was
distracted by

13:07.656 --> 13:10.528
that girl who was
laughing at them.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.052
What girl?

13:12.139 --> 13:14.837
Some blond girl who
went to their school.

13:14.924 --> 13:15.838
She was mean.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.062
Haley.
What a nice surprise.

13:22.149 --> 13:25.935
Hi, Miss Silvers.
I heard you're
teaching here now.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.415
I'm glad
I ran into you.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.069
I'm worried
about your sister.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.724
She had a fight with
Kelly and Darbie.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.813
Bummer.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.640
Bummer indeed.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.381
I thought
it might be nice
to remind them

13:37.468 --> 13:39.340
of how they
became friends.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.602
That's strange.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.299
I'm strange.

13:44.084 --> 13:47.000
Okay. Well, um--

13:47.087 --> 13:48.436
I remember
the day the met

13:48.523 --> 13:51.047
because Hannah was being
extra needy.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.963
Like,
more than usual.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.227
The last thing
I wanted to do was
hang out with Hannah.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.229
I was helping Hannah
with her math homework,

13:59.316 --> 14:01.231
which was
super frustrating.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.624
How hard are fractions?

14:02.711 --> 14:03.799
I don't get it.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.933
How is 2/4
the same as 1/2?

14:07.020 --> 14:09.544
You're dehydrating me
with your anxiety.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.719
Get me a glass of water.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.119
Then Hannah runs back,
grabs her book bag,

14:19.206 --> 14:22.862
and fishes out
the extra T-shirt
she always carries.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.951
You're gonna
change your clothes
right now?

14:25.038 --> 14:26.778
It's not for me.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.606
Here's
an extra shirt.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.173
But how did
Darbie fall?

14:30.260 --> 14:32.480
I wasn't
paying attention.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.743
But maybe you should
talk to that other kid.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.092
What other kid?

14:36.179 --> 14:37.659
The one from
basketball team.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.966
What did she
look like?

14:40.053 --> 14:42.664
Blond, I think.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.405
She was cool.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.798
Way cooler than
Kelly and Darbie.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.151
[bell jingles]

14:51.238 --> 14:53.283
That's different than
what Ms. Quinn told me.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.720
She said it was
Kelly's tray that fell.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.897
But Haley said
it was Darbie.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.463
We need to find
someone else who was there

14:59.550 --> 15:00.856
to make sense of this.

15:00.943 --> 15:01.988
I think
I have an idea.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.905
Hi.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.995
Of course I remember.

15:09.082 --> 15:11.084
It was one of those days.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.303
It started out
well enough,

15:13.390 --> 15:15.653
except for my ankle,
which I had sprained
the day before.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.351
Gina: Ida.
The girls.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.048
Ida: They were there.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.877
I was delivering
Kelly and Terri's order.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.618
That's when Hannah
ruined everything.

15:23.705 --> 15:24.706
Both: Hannah?

15:26.969 --> 15:29.189
[clattering]

15:29.276 --> 15:31.408
Oh, my gosh,
I am so sorry.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.239
This other girl,
was she blond
by any chance?

15:36.326 --> 15:39.286
Yes.
I think she was.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.636
She was also rude.
Didn't even help clean up.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.812
- Gina: Thanks, Ida.
- Ida: Of course.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.380
I always enjoy
talking with you, Gina.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.164
You should come in
more often.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.954
Didn't the riddle say
"don't miss a piece"?

15:55.041 --> 15:57.086
How can we reconstruct
the exact moment they met

15:57.173 --> 15:58.479
if every version
is different?

15:58.566 --> 16:00.307
Believe it or not,
I don't know everything.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.091
[bell jingles]

16:02.178 --> 16:04.746
Fine, we can get
some food to go,
then it's back to work.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.661
You had us paint the set
the wrong color.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.880
If we're gonna do it again,
we need a break.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.839
But-- But you wanted
to paint it red.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.797
I didn't know
the other walls
were gray.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.191
Why didn't you
say something?

16:15.278 --> 16:16.584
[scoffs]

16:22.677 --> 16:24.592
Let me guess.
You got an A minus,

16:24.679 --> 16:26.289
and you think
your life is over?

16:26.376 --> 16:28.204
B minus, actually.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.598
I was so nervous that
all the information

16:30.685 --> 16:32.730
got jumbled up in my head,
and I forgot the difference

16:32.817 --> 16:35.211
between a genotype
and a phenotype.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.517
I'm gonna need
a raspberry smoothie

16:36.604 --> 16:37.953
to alleviate
the pain of failure.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
Look, half the grade
is presenting it.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.132
Why don't you do
that part?

16:43.219 --> 16:45.178
I am not reading this.

16:45.265 --> 16:48.007
I wouldn't say that.
Or that. Or that.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.184
You're really
getting an A?

16:51.271 --> 16:53.229
You know, one thing
all three stories
have in common

16:53.316 --> 16:54.491
is the blond girl.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.406
The one who's
kind of mean.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.668
And plays on
the basketball team.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.019
But Haley said
she was cool.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.195
You want to trust
Haley's definition
of cool?

17:02.282 --> 17:03.457
True.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.241
Fine, then
I'll just read it.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.852
Good. And you can take
my name off of it, too.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.116
I'll tell Mr. Reidel
what you did.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.421
Feel free to tell him
what you want.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.727
I took
the initiative.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.121
No, you did the
entire assignment.

17:15.208 --> 17:18.166
You don't get the
idea of team work,
do you?

17:18.253 --> 17:19.907
It was the same thing
when you played basketball.

17:19.994 --> 17:21.474
You were a ball hog.

17:21.561 --> 17:23.259
Uh, hey, Kell,
I know it's not
your shift,

17:23.346 --> 17:25.131
but the espresso machine
is busted again,

17:25.218 --> 17:26.871
and you're the only one
who can fix it.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.744
I'll be right back.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.572
Don't change anything.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.013
Can I help you?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.712
Have you noticed that
Kelly, Darbie and Hannah
aren't talking?

17:41.799 --> 17:43.236
Yeah, and it's
no surprise.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.151
I totally called it.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.631
- About that--
- Do you remember
when they met?

17:47.718 --> 17:49.807
Why do you want to know?

17:49.894 --> 17:52.114
We're making them
a friendship book.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.682
Really?
That's lame.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.032
Yep, she's the one.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.816
Can you tell us
about that day?

17:58.903 --> 18:00.688
Sure. Whatever.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.344
I mean,
who walks backwards?

18:04.431 --> 18:07.129
And who gets excited
about cleaning spills?

18:07.216 --> 18:09.784
And who carries
an extra T-shirt?

18:09.871 --> 18:12.091
I said that friendship
wouldn't last.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.092
I was so right.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.312
All fixed.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.705
The steam nozzle
was clogged again.

18:17.792 --> 18:18.923
Thanks, Kell.
You're the best.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.406
Charlotte was
actually helpful.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.669
Yeah. I think I know
what we need to do.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.151
Darbie,
your food's ready.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.979
I haven't
ordered anything yet.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.024
No, but you just won
a free meal.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.026
It's all your
favorite stuff.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.854
Thanks, Jake.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.727
It's about time
something good
happened today.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.207
But there's
one condition.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.947
You have to take this tray
over to your table

18:43.034 --> 18:45.820
while walking backwards.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.822
- Huh?
- That's the rule.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.085
Come on,
you used to do this
all the time as a kid.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.131
Um, how did you know that?

18:52.218 --> 18:53.567
Look, if you don't
want the food--

18:53.654 --> 18:56.265
Okay, okay,
I'm walking.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.224
Kelly,
the espresso machine
is clogged again.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.099
Kelly, hurry.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.103
[clattering]

19:08.190 --> 19:09.496
Kelly: Oh, no.
Are you okay?

19:09.583 --> 19:12.455
I'm fine.
I'm an expert
at tripping.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.065
Guess I have to
go home and change.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.025
Anyone have
an extra shirt?

19:17.112 --> 19:18.722
Believe it or not,
I do.

19:21.638 --> 19:24.075
Here. I always carry
an extra shirt

19:24.163 --> 19:25.294
in case of
emergencies.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.600
You spill a lot, too?

19:26.687 --> 19:28.602
Me? Never.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.560
Oh. Well, I do.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.128
I may have to
hit you up again
one day.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.912
That milkshake
looked really good, too.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.132
It was half banana smoothie
and half chocolate milkshake.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.699
You should
try it sometime.

19:38.786 --> 19:42.137
But it makes a mess.
Here, let me help.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.400
- Darbie: Wow.
- Hey, you're really fast
at cleaning that.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.446
My kid brother's
always spilling stuff.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.621
Especially when I cook.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.232
You cook?
I love to bake.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.365
I love to lick
the batter.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.018
We should all
cook together sometime.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.195
That would be
really fun.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.588
Who did this?

19:58.675 --> 20:00.155
Sorry, Mama P.
It was me.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.809
I'm such a klutz.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.159
No,
actually, it was me.
I bumped into her.

20:04.246 --> 20:07.075
It was all my fault.
I distracted her.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.642
Just be more careful
next time.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.912
Guys,
what happened?

20:17.999 --> 20:20.480
I don't know,
but can we never
do that ever again?

20:20.567 --> 20:21.698
Like, ever.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.309
Yeah, that was
horrible.

20:24.832 --> 20:25.746
Welcome back.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.663
The spell you cast
to remember magic

20:29.750 --> 20:31.273
made you forget
your friendship.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.101
I remember.

20:33.188 --> 20:36.583
I mean,
I remember forgetting,
if that makes sense.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.020
What's the point of
remembering magic

20:39.107 --> 20:41.805
if we forget
our friendship?

20:41.892 --> 20:44.068
There's nothing
more important than that.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.636
Not even the magic.

20:46.723 --> 20:49.248
Thank you both so much
for fixing this.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.858
That's what
friends are for.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.381
Jake and I make
a good team.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.431
[giggling]

20:58.518 --> 21:00.650
So, what should we
do now?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.783
Don't you have
some work to do?

21:02.870 --> 21:05.046
Go on.
Show 'em who's boss.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.397
Okay, guys,
break's over.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.007
We need to
get back to work now.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.705
Five more minutes.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.750
I said now.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.406
And if you need to
text anyone, do it now,

21:17.493 --> 21:19.713
'cause I'm starting
a no cell phone policy.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.931
Aw, man.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.720
And after everything
the family went through,

21:26.807 --> 21:28.417
they wanted
a clean slate.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.421
Such a shame.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.467
Do you keep in touch
with them?

21:34.554 --> 21:36.643
No. When they moved away,
I retired.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.255
Does that answer
your questions?

21:40.342 --> 21:41.430
It does.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.261
Thank you for your time.
And for the tea.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.490
Laura, who is this?

21:59.622 --> 22:01.929
Kelly, it's me.
Call me right away.

22:02.016 --> 22:04.888
I have some information
that's very important.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.281
There's a box,

22:06.368 --> 22:08.022
and the book is
the key to the magic.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.334
So, is Charlotte
still mad at you?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.292
No, we redid
the assignment together,

22:17.379 --> 22:19.033
and she actually had
some good ideas.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.122
Good ideas, like
putting a gargoyle head

22:21.209 --> 22:23.124
in a 1920's mystery play?

22:23.211 --> 22:24.125
Please tell me
you told him no.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.431
Oh, I did.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.129
I also made Sawyer
repaint the set gray.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.478
I kind of like
being in charge.

22:29.565 --> 22:30.653
[sighing]

22:32.829 --> 22:34.091
It's gonna be fine.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.355
It's just one
small quiz.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.488
It's just that
I knew the answers.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.185
Shows what nerves can do.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.318
Well, next time,
call me before your test,

22:43.405 --> 22:44.624
and I'll tell you
a joke.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.625
Deal.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.542
Well, that spell
went really wrong.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.545
So much for protecting us
from forgetting magic.

22:52.632 --> 22:53.981
Maybe Jake was right.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.070
Maybe they're not gonna
come after us.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.464
I mean, we haven't been
spelled yet.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.205
- [knocking]
- Girls.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.251
- Hi.
- All: Hi.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.948
Your mom said
you were out here.

23:05.035 --> 23:08.691
Oh. What a beautiful
club house.

23:08.778 --> 23:11.259
I guess Chuck was
good for something.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.478
Who's Chuck?

23:12.565 --> 23:14.610
Huh. I wish I could
forget him, too.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.397
No, seriously.
Who's Chuck?

23:18.484 --> 23:21.922
Chuck,
the kid from the 1860s
who ruined our summer?

23:22.009 --> 23:24.403
Oh, you girls.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.535
I wish I had
your imagination.

23:29.538 --> 23:30.452
Oh, no.
