15:08.020 --> 15:08.990
[Mike] And I didn't
know the guy.

15:09.190 --> 15:11.170
This should not have happened.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.530
But he asked for it.

15:14.730 --> 15:16.760
Go away. I swear to fucking God,

15:16.960 --> 15:18.460
if you don't get the fuck
out of my office,

15:18.660 --> 15:20.480
I will have you fucking removed.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.640
This is on you, Mike.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.870
His blood is on you.

15:25.070 --> 15:26.450
[Mike] The fuck it is.

15:27.690 --> 15:28.970
This war's what I'm trying
to stop.

15:29.170 --> 15:30.580
It is not stopping, Mike.

15:30.780 --> 15:31.880
How simple are you?

15:32.080 --> 15:34.680
There is no peace.
There will be no peace.

15:34.880 --> 15:39.070
There is no band-aid big enough
to stop this fucking bleeding.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.510
[Mike sighing] Evelyn.

15:44.070 --> 15:46.040
Lockett went back on his word.

15:46.340 --> 15:48.530
He put the target
on his own back.

15:48.730 --> 15:49.860
Do you understand?

15:50.060 --> 15:51.700
And then goes around
puffing his fucking chest

15:51.900 --> 15:53.430
like he's a law-and-order hero,

15:53.630 --> 15:55.070
knowing full well
he's not the law

15:55.270 --> 15:57.070
and that the order
was only temporary.

15:57.270 --> 16:01.120
He knew what he was fucking with
and who he was fucking over.

16:03.190 --> 16:05.180
But that's done now, Evelyn.

16:05.380 --> 16:06.360
Get out.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.900
You have the pen now.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.840
You can turn this around

16:14.440 --> 16:15.840
and be smart.

16:16.470 --> 16:17.460
It can be quiet.

16:17.660 --> 16:18.790
No one has to know it's you.

16:18.990 --> 16:20.340
[Evelyn]Not anymore, Mike.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.580
Quiet is a luxury
for peace time.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.820
We are at war now.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.890
The war only ends
when you sign the treaty.

16:35.220 --> 16:39.460
Okay, this...
This is the treaty.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.490
[rock music]

16:50.690 --> 16:52.970
Hey, Kyle,
Captain talk to you or what?

16:53.910 --> 16:56.490
Yeah. He said we gotta
get our stories straight.

16:56.690 --> 16:58.900
"Story." Singular. Okay?

16:59.100 --> 17:00.730
That's it.
There's only one fucking story.

17:00.930 --> 17:03.120
All right? That's all
you gotta worry about.

17:10.460 --> 17:11.780
[Ian] Lew, how's it going?

17:11.980 --> 17:12.840
[Lewis] Hey, it's going.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.210
[Ian] Let's have a Coors,

17:14.410 --> 17:17.120
and a Jack and Coke, or
whatever, whatever Mikey wants.

17:17.320 --> 17:18.950
- [Lewis] Whiskey, Mikey?
- Yeah.

17:19.150 --> 17:22.670
Uh, hold the Coke, Lew, for me.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.040
Good man, thank you.

17:26.970 --> 17:28.630
Robert and his team
saved our fucking lives.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.760
Yeah, I know that. I know that.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.260
It's just the Captain,
he wants us

17:32.460 --> 17:33.930
to, you know, talk
about the details.

17:34.130 --> 17:35.470
Gotta sync the details.

17:35.670 --> 17:36.930
That's the shit
that's gonna trip us up.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.040
No fucking tripping us up.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.800
I mean, we're in
the goddamn right, period.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.860
That's it. End of story.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.710
- What's up?
- [Ian] Hey, man.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.380
- [Mike] What do you wanna order?
- [Robert] Hey, Lew.

17:47.580 --> 17:48.750
Can I get a beer?

17:48.950 --> 17:50.420
Actually, fuck that,
just a shot.

17:50.620 --> 17:51.980
I don't have time for beer.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.050
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.700
Yeah.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.150
I found the rat.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.260
What? You're kidding me?

17:58.460 --> 18:00.660
Yeah, I fucking found him.

18:00.860 --> 18:01.530
Who is it?

18:01.730 --> 18:03.200
It's fucking Ben Morrisey.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.600
[Kyle] Jesus fuck!

18:04.800 --> 18:06.230
That motherfucker.
He was in it with us.

18:06.430 --> 18:07.330
- [Robert] Yeah.
- Probably took out

18:07.530 --> 18:08.950
20 guys himself.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.070
- You talk to him?
- No, not yet.

18:11.270 --> 18:12.900
I mean, my lawyer said
that I fucking shouldn't,

18:13.100 --> 18:14.110
but I don't know.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.740
Your lawyer's fucking right.
Don't talk to him.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.030
Yeah.

18:18.460 --> 18:19.410
Mike, you want me to go?

18:19.610 --> 18:22.330
No. You neither, Kyle.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.620
Nobody fucking talk to this guy.
I'll do it.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.980
I don't like it, Mike.
I don't fucking like it.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.290
We got IA tomorrow.

18:28.490 --> 18:29.640
[knocking on counter]
Lew.

18:31.010 --> 18:31.920
All of you?

18:32.120 --> 18:33.090
No, I already did mine.

18:33.290 --> 18:35.110
Just these two
and a couple guys from the team.

18:37.110 --> 18:38.230
Morrisey?

18:38.430 --> 18:40.060
That fucking guy
already talked to the DA,

18:40.270 --> 18:42.550
so the IA doesn't need him.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.190
All right, well, he's still
gotta testify.

18:47.020 --> 18:50.490
So I'll talk to him.
See what we see, you know?

18:51.090 --> 18:53.230
Try to get him not to burn
the whole fucking house down.

You working the bars, bitch?

19:40.240 --> 19:41.740
What did I do to you?

19:42.910 --> 19:43.900
Hm?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.680
Walk in here.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.980

19:50.550 --> 19:53.100
I ain't got time
for new bullshit, is all.

19:53.310 --> 19:54.310
Don't need the complications.

19:54.510 --> 19:55.610
Got enough of that shit
without you.

19:55.810 --> 19:57.810
Okay, well, I ain't trying
to be your bullshit.

19:58.010 --> 19:59.790
Trying to get
the fuck out of here.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.590
[music]

20:09.790 --> 20:11.810
Why you wanna come back here?

20:12.610 --> 20:13.940
I don't know.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.250
Best find your answers, girl.

20:17.510 --> 20:20.580
Hey. South bar's empty.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.250
One of you, get.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.900
It's fucking 8:00.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.220
I look like fucking
Blue Plate pussy to you?

20:29.390 --> 20:31.890
You just got the bar.

20:33.660 --> 20:35.130
[Coco] I'm going.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.000
[music]

20:55.080 --> 20:56.180
You too.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.690
Go make some money.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.600
Milo wants to see you.

21:10.430 --> 21:12.630
Okay. Now?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.740
He'll send for you.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.770
Okay.

21:18.970 --> 21:21.680
Go. He'll send someone.

21:22.210 --> 21:23.380
Tonight?

21:24.210 --> 21:26.950
[Tatiana] You don't have to ask
all of the questions.

21:27.350 --> 21:30.180
Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow,

21:31.020 --> 21:33.190
maybe he'll forget
all about you.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.400
Go.

Hey.

Shit, uh...

What are you doing here?

22:09.810 --> 22:11.440
I thought you had the...
you were working.

22:11.640 --> 22:14.110
They screwed up the shifts,
so I figured I'd surprise you

22:14.310 --> 22:17.150
with some home cooking.

22:17.350 --> 22:20.030
Oh, shit, really?

22:20.500 --> 22:21.970
Yeah.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.520
Fuck, I'm sorry. I was with Ian.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.340
We were at the, um...

22:26.670 --> 22:28.030
At the bar?

I got the IA shit tomorrow,
so, you know,

22:30.930 --> 22:32.600
the details and stuff, it's...

Yeah.

Smells amazing.

one-pan meals.

You wanna beer?

Oh, shit, you can't have a beer.

22:47.660 --> 22:48.960
Sorry.

Nothing, okay.

a lot of pressure. I got...

it's not coming from me.

Okay.

All right, Charlie...

23:50.990 --> 23:52.210
Thank you.

Of course.

Everything all right?

24:03.070 --> 24:04.470
I'm praying.

That's great, Charlie.

24:08.590 --> 24:10.530
I'm not asking for anything.

24:10.730 --> 24:13.850
I mean, people pray
for rain, money, or...

24:14.680 --> 24:17.020
I just like to pray
and say thank you.

24:23.460 --> 24:24.980
Do you wanna pray with me, Ian?

24:25.180 --> 24:26.660
Hundred percent, Charlie.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.970
Okay. I'm done.

24:38.910 --> 24:40.640
Amen.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.580
They found him.

24:47.380 --> 24:48.820
They found him.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.310
The body?

24:55.510 --> 24:57.660
[Ian] Yeah.
Right where you said.

25:01.730 --> 25:03.870
- The places?
- All the places.

25:08.270 --> 25:09.670
Good.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.590
Charlie, the Ohio State Police

25:15.790 --> 25:17.130
are gonna come up
and talk to you.

25:17.330 --> 25:18.460
They just wanna get specifics,

25:18.660 --> 25:20.580
and I just wanted you to know.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.550
Okay.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.620
I can call you, Ian,
when I think of more people.

25:29.390 --> 25:34.110
And if you...
If you ever need anything,

25:34.310 --> 25:36.930
I mean, someone to talk to,

25:38.170 --> 25:39.900
or anything...

25:45.140 --> 25:47.440
Yeah. Um.

25:50.110 --> 25:51.550
Yeah, Charlie, I mean, that...

25:54.020 --> 25:55.450
That would be great.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.480
[Charlie] Mm.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.590
Charlie, when was the last time
you went to the dentist?

26:05.690 --> 26:07.340
- What?
- [Ian] The dentist.

26:07.540 --> 26:08.550
The last time
you saw the dentist.

26:08.750 --> 26:09.850
I don't like the dentist.

26:10.050 --> 26:12.230
No, no, Charlie, ssh,
nobody likes the dentist.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.600
Nobody likes the dentist, right?

26:16.040 --> 26:20.290
But, um, I thought
maybe it'd be nice

26:20.490 --> 26:21.830
for us to get out a bit,
a field trip,

26:22.030 --> 26:23.560
you know, get you out
of here for a minute,

26:23.760 --> 26:25.500
get some fresh air.
Would you like that?

26:25.700 --> 26:27.100
I used to say French air.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.750
What? You what?

26:29.420 --> 26:31.270
When I was little,
I called it French air.

26:31.470 --> 26:33.340
[Ian] French air.
That's funny. That's funny.

26:33.540 --> 26:34.820
Look, Charlie.

26:36.490 --> 26:41.200
If you had to see the dentist,
right,

26:42.360 --> 26:43.780
it's outside the institution,

26:43.980 --> 26:47.350
so I would be the one
to drive you.

26:47.550 --> 26:49.420
Maybe take a little drive,
get some French air.

26:49.620 --> 26:50.970
Would you like that?

26:52.640 --> 26:55.540
I would. I would like that, Ian.

of chicken with that bit.

27:53.650 --> 27:55.040
Tell me what you think.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.640
Boy, whoo!

28:00.570 --> 28:02.460
- Yeah.
- Ah!

28:02.660 --> 28:04.810
- Thought you knew.
- Mm!

28:06.410 --> 28:08.520
Dawg, you got that touch, homie.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.090
[faint buzzing]

28:12.990 --> 28:14.260
You hear that?

28:14.890 --> 28:16.470
[Raphael] All I hear
is sizzling.

28:16.670 --> 28:18.180
[buzzing growing louder]

28:18.380 --> 28:19.760
Mm-mm.

28:22.060 --> 28:23.530
Listen.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.940
Seems like we got a bee problem.

28:31.370 --> 28:33.210
Or we got an AB problem.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.620
Thought your boy
was handling that.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.060
Yeah.

28:55.830 --> 28:59.270
Hey, yo!
I gotta make a phone call!

29:11.810 --> 29:14.450
[cellphone ringing]

29:14.920 --> 29:15.920
Yeah.

29:16.680 --> 29:20.440
Michael. Hi, I just wondered
if you got a chance

29:20.640 --> 29:21.870
to talk to Jacob.

29:22.070 --> 29:23.340
<i>You know, the boy in juvenile.</i>

29:23.540 --> 29:26.380
No, Ma. No, I've been busy.
I have not.

29:26.580 --> 29:28.810
Um, but I'll get to him
as soon as possible.

29:29.010 --> 29:30.450
- I promise you.
- [Mariam] <i>Okay.</i>

29:30.650 --> 29:33.480
Okay, it's just that he sounded
really bad,

29:33.680 --> 29:35.640
and he thinks
that you can help him.

29:36.370 --> 29:39.340
Yeah. I know.
I understand that, okay?

29:40.110 --> 29:42.590
<i>I've been very busy and I'll</i>
<i>get to it as soon as I can.</i>

29:42.790 --> 29:45.710
Okay. Any chance you could
come for dinner?

29:46.150 --> 29:47.460
Yeah, you know I'd like to,

29:47.660 --> 29:49.820
but I got lots of stuff
to do tonight, Mom.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.140
All right, well, you know where
the shrimp scampy is

29:53.340 --> 29:54.690
<i>when you're ready.</i>

29:56.790 --> 29:58.360
All right, I gotta go, Ma.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.530
Bye.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.300
[sighs]

30:04.230 --> 30:10.600
[music]

30:17.740 --> 30:21.750
[drone buzzing]

30:44.740 --> 30:45.870
What the fuck?

30:49.840 --> 30:52.000
- Fuck you. Oh, shit.
- [Mike] Fuck you.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.220
Yeah, how's that?
Don't bother getting up.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.650
[cellphone ringing]

31:03.420 --> 31:06.080
[Operator] <i>Hello,</i>
<i>this is a collect call from...</i>

31:06.280 --> 31:07.680
Gunner.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.330
[Operator] <i>At the Anchor Bay</i>
<i>Correctional Facility.</i>

31:11.100 --> 31:12.420
Where's the fucking shit?

31:12.620 --> 31:14.420
I got guys out there
with their dicks in their hands

31:14.620 --> 31:16.020
and the yard's shutting down.

31:16.220 --> 31:17.620
[Mike] <i>Yeah, well, tell them</i>
<i>to jerk off somewhere else</i>

31:17.820 --> 31:20.610
'cause your time in the yard
is fucking over.

31:21.080 --> 31:21.960
Who the fuck is this?

31:22.160 --> 31:23.290
[Mike] <i>The fuck you think it is?</i>

31:23.490 --> 31:25.360
Apparently, you didn't get
my fucking message?

31:25.560 --> 31:26.660
<i>Yeah, you did, you fuckhead.</i>

31:26.860 --> 31:28.400
<i>Your playing field</i>
<i>is fucking level.</i>

31:28.600 --> 31:32.090
That means no fucking drones,
no favors, no fucking nothing.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.810
You wanna earn, you do it
the old-fucking-fashioned way

31:35.010 --> 31:35.970
like everybody else.

31:36.170 --> 31:37.470
Fuck you, Mike.

31:37.670 --> 31:40.080
We made a fucking deal.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.550
Well, I got my foot
on the throat

31:41.750 --> 31:42.980
of how well you honor your deal.

31:43.180 --> 31:45.220
[Gunner] <i>It's not my fault</i>
<i>our people got the edge.</i>

31:45.420 --> 31:46.820
I'm done talking to you.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.200
Honor your part of the deal.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.870
<i>Or I can let you rot in there,</i>
<i>remember that.</i>

31:54.540 --> 31:56.580
Clean up your fucking toys.

33:10.900 --> 33:14.560
[Kyle] Mike, you gotta
call me back, man.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.590

33:21.030 --> 33:22.560
I found Iris.
