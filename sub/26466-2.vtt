A week ago, three suspects
invaded the school.

00:05.092 --> 00:06.223
You were not on campus.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.703
The school will remain closed.

00:07.746 --> 00:10.314
I'll step down as principal.

00:10.358 --> 00:13.143
[Reverend Holt] The killing
of Issa Williams is proof
that this drug, Green Light,

00:13.187 --> 00:16.277
has left our community
in grave danger.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.498
There are people infected
with this drug
who're running around

00:20.542 --> 00:22.413
-with dormant powers.
-Issa?

00:22.457 --> 00:24.372
So now they jumping
out of body bags and coming
back from the dead?

00:25.329 --> 00:26.722
-J, what's up?
-[panting]

00:26.765 --> 00:28.724
The purpose of Black Lightning

00:28.767 --> 00:32.206
-was to kill Tobias,
who killed my father.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.208
[Gambi] Thirty years ago,
they were conducting
an experiment in Freeland.

00:34.251 --> 00:37.080
Their vaccine inadvertently
created metahumans.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.778
I went to Gambi,
and I asked him to pull
some strings at the ASA

00:39.822 --> 00:41.432
to put me in charge
of the pods.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.956
I'm gonna find out
what's really going on
with you, Doctor.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.915
You're a liar.

00:45.958 --> 00:49.179
You're Painkiller.
So Garfield, that girl,
they belong to the past now.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.354
[groans]

00:50.398 --> 00:52.748
-This is not you.
-Jennifer, this is me.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.185
[grunting]

00:55.229 --> 00:58.188
[Tobias] Syonide was
the only thing left in this
world I gave a damn about.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.146
Time to die.

[screaming]

01:16.380 --> 01:18.861
[jazz music playing]

01:18.904 --> 01:20.645
[sighs] So, where were you?

01:24.171 --> 01:28.610
Man, I was where
she told me to be.
Covering the exit.

01:28.653 --> 01:31.613
-Look, if I would've known--
-If you had known?

01:31.656 --> 01:34.833
Negroes always fixing
their thick lips with excuses.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.663
You should have known, period.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.406
[sighs]

01:42.450 --> 01:43.668
Move.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.114
You said you knew how to play.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.768
I do. I just took your knight.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.125
[chuckles]

02:10.478 --> 02:11.522

02:15.961 --> 02:17.049
Listen carefully.

02:18.399 --> 02:19.748
[grunts]

02:21.053 --> 02:22.403
Check.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.536
Actions have consequences.
You have to anticipate.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.501
[chuckling]

02:34.328 --> 02:35.764
[groans]

02:35.807 --> 02:37.026
[Tobias] Check.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.028
[sighing] Move.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.433
[chuckling]

03:02.138 --> 03:04.445
Checkmate. You lose.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.577
You let me take your queen,

03:06.621 --> 03:09.406
just like you let that bitch
take Syonide from me.

04:21.478 --> 04:24.568
[gasping] Kam. Kam. Kam.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.886
It's okay. It's okay, Wendy.

04:41.629 --> 04:45.720
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.765
Just stay there.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.637
Stay there.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.334
[distorted chatter]

04:55.164 --> 04:57.427
[gasping]

04:57.471 --> 05:00.300
It's okay. We won't hurt you.
Don't be scared.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.129
Wait, wait, wait.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.088
It's okay. It's okay.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.570
[distorted] It's okay,
you can come to me.

05:09.613 --> 05:10.484
[in normal voice]
Come on, Wendy.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.546
[grunts]

05:32.897 --> 05:34.377
Somebody pull the video
for that room.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.857
I need to know
what happened, now. Go!

05:45.562 --> 05:47.651
Jeff, trouble.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.698
A boy woke up in a pod
and basically killed himself
and Kam.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.614
In the process,
he freed a girl.

05:53.657 --> 05:54.745
What?

05:54.789 --> 05:58.227
-Wait. Are you all right?
-I'm fine...

05:58.270 --> 06:00.664
but this girl has been asleep
for 30 years,

06:00.708 --> 06:05.060
then she wakes up in
the middle of a horror movie
and she gave us this look.

06:05.103 --> 06:08.324
I think she's having
a psychotic break,
and she's hallucinating.

06:09.412 --> 06:12.110
And Jeff, she's powerful.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.420
[Gambi] It was her.
Wendy Hernandez.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.727
I was the spotter
who ID'd her 30 years ago.

06:19.770 --> 06:24.340
She was...
Is a very smart young lady.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.387
Just graduated high school
and was heading
to nursing school.

06:29.476 --> 06:33.175
Wendy's power is aerokinesis.

06:33.218 --> 06:36.352
She controls wind
like you do electricity.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.703
She can speed up a breeze
into a full-blown hurricane.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.488
Okay, we need
to find her fast.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.891
Issa Williams,
AKA "Body Bag Boy."

06:53.935 --> 06:59.767
His girlfriend called 911,
scared out of her mind
when he came to her for help.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.465
The ASA picked him up
outside of her house.

07:02.509 --> 07:06.469
Why are you treating him
like he's al-Qaeda?
He's a 17-year-old boy.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.080
-Who died.
-At the hands
of Freeland PD,

07:09.124 --> 07:10.255
for loitering.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.997
Came back to life
and ran away.

07:13.041 --> 07:16.436
We need to know
what we're dealing with,
and you are the expert.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.613
Wait, you...

07:19.656 --> 07:22.529
You can't leave him with me.
He has a family.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.444
Who's afraid of him.

07:24.487 --> 07:28.360
So much so that even
his mother doesn't want
anything to do with him.

07:28.404 --> 07:32.147
Besides, we have to keep
this quiet. We don't want him
roaming the streets.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.889
-Agent Odell, this--
-You wanted the job.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.020
This is it.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.501
He's all yours.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.982
[chuckles]

07:49.817 --> 07:50.948
[Jennifer] Yo, you up?

07:50.992 --> 07:52.472
[Anissa]
Yeah, you wanna go for a run?

07:55.605 --> 07:57.085
Nope.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.174
Why are you running
since you have super powers?

07:59.217 --> 08:03.265
Because! The better shape
I'm in, the longer
I can hold my breath.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.310
The longer
I can hold my breath,
the longer--

08:05.354 --> 08:07.530
The longer
you can stay super strong
and invincible.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.532
-There you go.
-Girl, all you do is work.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.970
Doing what I love
isn't work, girl.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.929
[chuckles]

08:14.972 --> 08:18.149
You're just lucky your powers
are only dangerous
when you want them to be.

08:18.193 --> 08:21.065
You're lucky, too.
You're just not
letting yourself see it.

08:21.109 --> 08:24.808
[chuckles]
Are you seriously still on
the "it's a blessing" train?

08:25.983 --> 08:27.681
How, Anissa?

08:27.724 --> 08:31.685
I haven't gotten cramps
with a period
since my powers came in.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.208
How 'bout you?

08:35.427 --> 08:36.951
-That's true, actually.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:36.994 --> 08:40.694
See? See? These powers
are a blessing from God.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.652
Well, that part...
That part is a gift

08:42.696 --> 08:46.134
because my cramps be doing
the most sometimes, but...

08:46.177 --> 08:48.049
maybe it means
I can't have kids.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.660
Mmm-mmm. No.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.662
Dad had powers,
and here we are.

08:52.706 --> 08:55.665
Yeah, but it could
turn bad real quick
if it becomes your only joy.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.146
That's actually deep.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.670
You need to get out more.

09:00.714 --> 09:04.456
I'm stuck in here
until the wardens
release me, but...

09:04.500 --> 09:07.590
Hey, hey. By the way,
why do we have
"wardens," plural?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.374
-I don't know.
-What's going on
with Mom and Dad?

09:09.418 --> 09:12.552
-Are they getting
back together?
-It's kinda cute.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.423
I think I heard them
the other night.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.556
I heard them.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.646
Good. 'Cause they've been
walking around all emo,
like they sexually frustrated.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.082
-They have. Yeah.
-[both laughing]

09:22.866 --> 09:24.346
[Anissa sighs]

09:24.389 --> 09:30.482
And listen. Relationships,
they complicated. All right?

09:30.526 --> 09:32.920
How would you know?
You're not in one.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.618
You don't even have anybody.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.272
I'm just saying.
You need to get back out there

09:37.315 --> 09:38.795
-before you dry up.
-Okay, you know what?

09:38.839 --> 09:39.883
-Come here. Come here.
-Dry up.

09:39.927 --> 09:40.928
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

09:44.192 --> 09:46.107
We're giving him
lots of fluids.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.719
Issa?

09:50.894 --> 09:51.678
Issa.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.376
Someone here to see you.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.467
Tiff.

10:01.513 --> 10:02.558
Hey.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.255
How you doing?

10:05.169 --> 10:06.736
I'm breathin'.

10:06.780 --> 10:10.610
[sighs] My insides, feels like
my damn blood's itchin'.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.916
It's a withdrawal
from Green Light.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.962
We're working on something
to help you with that.

10:17.791 --> 10:18.661
How you doin'?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.403
Hmm.

10:21.446 --> 10:24.754
Right now, I'm...
I'm thanking God
for Dr. Stewart.

10:24.798 --> 10:25.799

10:29.629 --> 10:31.543
But you scare
the hell out of me.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.895
I'm not trying to take care
of some... some zombie
from the damn dead.

10:34.938 --> 10:35.896
-Tiff.
-[Lynn] Tiffany.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.681
Why'd I say that?

10:41.728 --> 10:44.731
I wanna walk away,
and I never wanna
see you again.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.646
-[Issa] No, wait.

they say humility
is the highest form

tryin' not to get
that hair wet.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.970
It's too late for that.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.494

13:19.537 --> 13:23.106

I got a million songs
and a closet full of heels.

13:24.847 --> 13:28.329
That combination
last night was epic.

13:28.372 --> 13:32.812

for a while because I have
a class I have to go to.

-Class?
-Medical school.

Okay, but are you sure?

13:43.953 --> 13:47.348
I'll call my pilot,
get the jet ready, we can
have dim sum in New York.

26:22.319 --> 26:23.625
What's happening here?

26:26.715 --> 26:27.977
What's happening

26:28.021 --> 26:29.500
is I feel trapped,
like some sort of monster.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.198
Might as well put me
in one of those pods.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.243
I wish everything would
just go back to normal.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.637
Stop whining, little girl.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.509
I'm sick of it.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.948
Issa, your jugular vein
is twitching a lot.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.777
Well, ever since
I came back alive,

26:44.820 --> 26:46.822
when I'm around people
and when I look at them...

26:48.781 --> 26:50.173
it makes them tell the truth.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.220
Okay, girls,
excuse yourselves.

26:53.263 --> 26:55.570
-We need to talk.
-Yeah. Would you excuse us
for a minute?

27:06.886 --> 27:09.323
[Jefferson and Lynn
arguing indistinctly]

27:11.238 --> 27:12.369
Psst.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.602
[Issa sighs]
Your dad sounds pissed.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.299
[Jefferson and Lynn
continue arguing]

27:29.343 --> 27:30.779
Yeah, he's just overreacting.

27:33.782 --> 27:34.783
You sure about that?

27:36.306 --> 27:38.744
Oh, yeah. I was supposed
to be in therapy. This is it.

27:41.747 --> 27:45.054
Hey, no more of that
truth-teller stuff, all right?

27:45.098 --> 27:46.795
I don't know how not to do it.

27:48.797 --> 27:49.972
Me, neither.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.975
Huh?

27:53.019 --> 27:55.064
See. That's what
I'm talking about.

27:55.108 --> 27:58.807
Right there, you made
eye contact, and then that
thing twitched in your neck.

27:58.851 --> 28:02.332
See, look away. Look away
and ask me something.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.856
[Issa] Um...

28:03.899 --> 28:07.381
-Uh, what?
-I don't care what. Anything.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.600
What's your favorite color?

28:10.950 --> 28:11.733
Red.

28:12.386 --> 28:13.213
Really?

28:13.909 --> 28:14.736
No.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.565
Let's try again.

28:17.608 --> 28:20.742
-Um, do you like ice cream?
-I hate it.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.790
Thank God,
I can still lie. [sighs]

28:24.833 --> 28:26.792
Yeah, the truth
isn't always good.

28:28.315 --> 28:29.751
Fastest way for me
to get in trouble

28:29.795 --> 28:32.406
is to tell my parents a truth
they don't want to hear.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.103
Damn.

28:34.147 --> 28:37.411
If I just walk
down the street,
I can cause major problems.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.805
Might even get somebody killed
if I get near a Hundred banger

28:39.848 --> 28:41.763
and he goes telling
another banger
what he's feeling.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.852
Well, we just figured out
how it works.

28:44.635 --> 28:46.115
So work it.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.421
[Lynn] Issa, where are you?

28:50.859 --> 28:52.295
Okay, the warden's calling.

28:53.862 --> 28:54.776
Oh, no.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.039
[chuckles]

28:57.083 --> 29:01.565
Oh, by the way, she doesn't
know I'm out here, and she
can't make you tell the truth.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.350
-You remember that?
-Yeah.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.134
Thank you. [chuckles]

29:07.702 --> 29:09.051
-[upbeat music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

29:16.972 --> 29:17.756
[laughs]

29:20.497 --> 29:22.978
[indistinct chatter]

29:38.602 --> 29:41.257
-I want you to meet some
of my friends. This is Chris.
-Hi.

29:41.301 --> 29:45.958
-Hey. This is Sarah.
-Hi. Nice to meet you, Sarah.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.835
Hey.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.924
-[Grace] Hey.
-How you been?

29:55.968 --> 29:56.882
Just peachy.

29:59.667 --> 30:00.711
[chuckles]

30:02.061 --> 30:04.846
Look, I'm sorry
I haven't called in a minute.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.892
Things have really been crazy.

30:06.935 --> 30:07.936
I can tell.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.112
I have to get back to work.

30:24.692 --> 30:27.260
Detective Summers,
how was your vacation?

30:27.303 --> 30:30.350
I realized I don't like
my wife and kids.

30:30.393 --> 30:33.309
But thanks for lending me
your home in the Caymans.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.268
Next time,
I'll bring my girlfriend.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.878
Well, you've always been
a good friend.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.750
What you got for me?

30:39.794 --> 30:40.882
[sighs]

30:51.675 --> 30:52.676
Need anything else?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.854
[sighs] No.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.521
[indistinct chatter]

31:11.565 --> 31:13.959
[Jefferson] Okay, uh,
can I have your attention,
please? Excuse me.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.918
Um, I'll be brief.

31:16.962 --> 31:21.140
When the school reopens,
I will be replaced
as principal.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.664
His name is...
His name is Mike Lowry,

31:23.707 --> 31:28.103
and I'm sure he will
introduce himself to you
in whatever way he sees fit.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.931
I thought I'd never
see this day.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.542
Yeah, well, none of us did,
but at least you'll see it
with tenure.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.196
How could you do this to us?

31:34.240 --> 31:37.112
Look, I wanna apologize
for anything you've suffered

31:37.156 --> 31:39.941
because of the decisions
I've made, I really do,

31:39.985 --> 31:44.163
but I'm confident
that this is a good change
and to everyone's benefit.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.339
Trust me.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.168
All right, thank you.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.910
[all murmuring]

31:55.522 --> 31:57.045
I got some lab results.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.963
You definitely have
the metagene, Issa.

32:05.314 --> 32:08.100
The gene destabilizes
the cells,

32:08.143 --> 32:12.104
then the cells
change fundamentally,
giving people powers.

32:12.147 --> 32:14.149
But when the metagene
is formed artificially,

32:14.193 --> 32:16.238
like yours was
from Green Light...

32:18.632 --> 32:20.634
the cells won't re-stabilize.

32:22.418 --> 32:23.463
What does that mean?

32:26.074 --> 32:29.164
It means, at some point,
the cells in your body
will break down.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.127
So I'm gonna die?

32:38.913 --> 32:40.349
Without a cure, yes...

32:42.525 --> 32:44.049
but I'm working hard
to find one.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.615
What if you don't find it?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.054
How long do I have to live?

32:52.100 --> 32:55.495
Some people experience
body failure immediately,

32:55.538 --> 32:58.759
but it could be
six months or longer.
We just can't tell.

33:00.152 --> 33:02.719
I can put you in a pod
to stabilize you.

33:06.027 --> 33:09.204
I popped Green Light pills
just a couple of times,

33:09.248 --> 33:12.338
and you're telling me
my only choices are death...

33:13.730 --> 33:17.038
or to get in one of
those pod things?

33:21.347 --> 33:22.609
[sighs]

33:23.218 --> 33:24.350
I'm sorry.

33:39.147 --> 33:42.237
Jeff, I've got
Wendy Hernandez.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.065
She's at the old
Freeland youth center.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.893
You better get over there.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.677
[whooshing]

33:47.721 --> 33:50.680
-[wind whooshing]
-[siren blaring]

33:53.335 --> 33:54.902
-[grunts]
-[tires screeching]

33:59.515 --> 34:00.560
Go.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.825
[groans]

34:14.748 --> 34:16.228
I don't wanna hurt you.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.449
[grunting]

34:22.408 --> 34:23.670
[grunts]

34:27.804 --> 34:29.589
[groaning]

34:36.770 --> 34:38.206
[electricity crackling]

34:38.250 --> 34:39.990
[groaning]

34:48.869 --> 34:50.392
[panting]

35:03.536 --> 35:04.363
Who are you?

35:05.277 --> 35:06.582
A friend, Wendy.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.811
I know someone
who can help you.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.346
[Lynn] You sure
you wanna do this?

35:32.608 --> 35:35.785
Yeah. Yeah.

35:35.829 --> 35:39.006
I couldn't see myself
stuck in one of those pods.

35:39.049 --> 35:42.618
So I'm gonna stay out,
for however long I have.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.275
Don't miss
any appointments, okay?

35:48.450 --> 35:49.495
I won't.

35:50.452 --> 35:51.627
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.297
[sighs]

36:20.308 --> 36:23.355
That boy's got a tough road
ahead of him.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.183
You sure he shouldn't
be placed in a pod?

36:25.879 --> 36:27.010
Like I laid out...

36:29.230 --> 36:33.103
this gives us the opportunity
to study the subject
in a natural environment,

36:33.626 --> 36:35.236
not in a lab.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.326
Gotta do more
than a study on this one.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.415
If his talents
can be contained,

36:41.503 --> 36:42.722
could be useful.

36:48.815 --> 36:51.861
-You went without me?
-You weren't around.

36:51.905 --> 36:54.560
Okay, why didn't you call?

36:54.603 --> 36:58.303
Why weren't you around
so I didn't have to call?

36:58.346 --> 37:00.305
Yeah, never mind.
I can see the hickey
on your neck from here.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.697
You know what?
Just tell me
what happened to--

37:01.741 --> 37:06.441
Young lady, you need
to change your tone, quick.

37:08.661 --> 37:09.792
[sighs]

37:11.185 --> 37:13.318
What happened?

37:13.361 --> 37:18.410
I lit her up. It shocked her
out of her psychotic episode.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.456
After that, she elected
to go back into a pod

37:21.500 --> 37:24.111
while your mother
figures these things out.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.768
Wow, I...

37:28.811 --> 37:31.466
I just don't know
if I could do that.
That's like...

37:32.772 --> 37:33.642
Look...

37:34.774 --> 37:37.472
you may not be going
into a pod,

37:37.516 --> 37:42.260
but if you don't tighten up
your act, you're gonna end up
in a casket.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.828
Wow.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.309
Get a new song, Dad,
because this one's old.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.789
Yeah... [sighs]

37:56.448 --> 37:57.884
[Wendy sighs]

37:58.885 --> 38:00.582
I'm scared.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.542
You say a prayer,
and you'll be asleep
before you know it, okay?

38:04.978 --> 38:06.240
[sniffles]

38:15.902 --> 38:17.033
[door beeps]

38:20.254 --> 38:21.473
[hissing]

38:30.656 --> 38:32.440
[lively chatter]

38:51.633 --> 38:53.461
[chattering stops]

38:53.505 --> 38:54.375
[sighs]

38:59.206 --> 39:00.816
I love Garfield High.

39:04.603 --> 39:06.387
I loved it as a student.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.044
Loved it as a teacher,

39:12.611 --> 39:14.352
and I have loved it
as a principal.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.139
But when the school reopens...

39:20.967 --> 39:23.404
I will no longer be principal
of Garfield High.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.405
-[boy exclaims] What?
-[girl] Why?

39:24.449 --> 39:25.667
[crowd exclaiming]

39:25.711 --> 39:26.886
Why?

39:26.929 --> 39:29.671
[stammers]
I need you to hear me.

39:29.715 --> 39:33.719
I wanted to be
the one to tell you
so that you know that I...

39:33.762 --> 39:35.721
I still have love
for my students.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.158
Okay, look.

39:38.201 --> 39:41.161
It is a fact the school
was attacked.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.644
It's a fact that I...

39:45.687 --> 39:51.432
That I was not here during
the attack or its aftermath.

39:54.043 --> 40:00.528
The board has decided that
these facts are unacceptable,
and they're right.

40:00.572 --> 40:04.663
I accept full responsibility
for the consequences
of my actions,

40:04.706 --> 40:07.448
as I would expect from
each and every one of you.

40:08.536 --> 40:12.497
But I'm not going anywhere.

40:12.540 --> 40:18.851
I am honored to remain
at Garfield as a teacher.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.593
And I will give
my full support
to the new principal.

40:27.947 --> 40:28.991
Thank you...

40:33.039 --> 40:35.433
for always teaching me.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.442
[boy] Where's the future?

40:49.925 --> 40:51.536
Right here.

40:51.579 --> 40:54.060
[all] And whose life is this?

40:58.281 --> 40:59.979
Mine.

41:00.022 --> 41:02.503
[all] What are you going
to do with it?

41:05.114 --> 41:08.727
Live it
by any means necessary.

41:08.770 --> 41:11.207
[all cheering and applauding]
