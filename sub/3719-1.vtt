- Crooked.

Would you like to
come in for a drink?

Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

15:10.709 --> 15:11.841
Pardon the mess.

15:11.843 --> 15:14.744

Oh, no, it's, uh...

This is lovely.
Lovely.

Thank you.

Oh, uh, what can I get
for the two of you?

15:22.487 --> 15:23.653

15:23.655 --> 15:24.787
- Oh, don't bother.
- A coffee maybe.

15:24.789 --> 15:26.789
- Whiskey?
- Oh.

15:26.791 --> 15:29.058
That'll be very nice.
Sit, Cat.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.060
Go ahead, sit.

15:36.768 --> 15:42.872
So, um, what was this history
you mentioned, Dave?

15:42.874 --> 15:44.974
We heard it was
a funeral parlor

15:44.976 --> 15:47.210
around the turn of the century?

15:47.212 --> 15:51.414
But, I've got to say,
the price they were asking

15:51.416 --> 15:53.216
wasn't about to scare us away.

15:53.218 --> 15:54.984
Good. Good.

15:54.986 --> 15:59.856
So, the realtor told you
all about the Dagmars.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.291
Yes. That was the family...
Thank you...

16:02.293 --> 16:03.392
Who first lived here, right?

16:03.394 --> 16:04.894
Yes.
Yes, that's right.

16:04.896 --> 16:09.866
I mean, the town built this
house for him back in 1859.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.100
Well, cheers.

16:11.102 --> 16:12.502
Oh, yes.

16:12.504 --> 16:15.805
To new friends,
and new beginnings.

16:17.675 --> 16:20.042
1859.
You don't say?

16:20.044 --> 16:21.244
Yeah.

16:21.246 --> 16:26.182
It wasn't long after that
that the trouble began.

16:26.184 --> 16:29.085
Old Dagmar had been
running the parlor

16:29.087 --> 16:32.355
no more than a couple
of months when...

16:32.357 --> 16:36.092
well, what do you know,
word got out that

16:36.094 --> 16:40.196
they were selling the bodies
and burying empty coffins.

16:40.198 --> 16:43.332
People were saying he
was selling the corpses

16:43.334 --> 16:46.836
to the university
over in Essex County.

16:46.838 --> 16:48.905
Some even said he was selling
them to the Orientals

16:48.907 --> 16:53.309
over in Boston,
turning them into chop suey.

16:53.311 --> 16:55.111
[coughing]

16:55.113 --> 16:57.947
The town ran him
and his wife

16:57.949 --> 17:01.017
and the little girl
out on a rail.

17:01.019 --> 17:04.720
It was just the saddest thing.

17:04.722 --> 17:06.055
They moved to Providence

17:06.057 --> 17:11.961
but his family just couldn't
stand the sight of him.

17:11.963 --> 17:16.065
Old Dagmar drank himself to
death no more than a year later.

17:16.067 --> 17:19.935
They say he was no more than
a shell of a man at the end.

17:19.938 --> 17:23.906
He was more than a shell.

17:23.907 --> 17:25.974
- No, we hadn't heard anything...
- You told us...

17:25.977 --> 17:27.276

Honey, it's all right.

17:27.278 --> 17:29.645

you're quite right.

46:57.313 --> 46:59.914
Do you really, Maddie?

46:59.916 --> 47:01.816
Do you?

47:01.818 --> 47:05.720
The town didn't
realized it back in '49.

47:05.722 --> 47:09.123
And when that darkness
didn't get a new family,

47:09.125 --> 47:14.528
it spread like plague
until it found many.

47:14.530 --> 47:16.631
The Dagmars will get them.

47:16.633 --> 47:18.432
After what this town
did to that family,

47:18.434 --> 47:20.835
they'd kill God himself if
He walked into their house.

47:20.837 --> 47:24.205
But they haven't, Maddie.

47:24.207 --> 47:27.441
They haven't

47:27.443 --> 47:29.477
and it's time.

47:29.479 --> 47:30.845
The darkness under that house

47:30.847 --> 47:36.717
wakes up every 30 years
like clockwork and it's hungry.

47:36.719 --> 47:41.589
If it doesn't get a
new family this time,

47:41.591 --> 47:45.259
it's gonna swallow this town.

47:45.261 --> 47:48.262
Then we'll do it ourselves.

47:58.374 --> 48:00.341
Oh!

48:00.343 --> 48:02.376
Oh, I...

48:02.378 --> 48:03.778
Sorry.

48:03.780 --> 48:06.747
I mean, I thought we
were getting comfortable.

48:06.749 --> 48:08.482
No, it's cool.

48:08.484 --> 48:13.554
Just wasn't expecting you to
be so relaxed with the policy.

48:13.556 --> 48:16.323
Yeah, I'll smoke outside.

48:17.894 --> 48:20.127
Sorry I took so long.

48:20.129 --> 48:22.763
I was feeling the most
unreal energy in the hall.

48:22.765 --> 48:26.400
Yeah, no,
it's total unreal, right?

48:26.402 --> 48:28.235
Are you comfortable?

48:28.237 --> 48:30.171
Yeah.

48:35.645 --> 48:38.779
There is a real power
in this house.

48:38.781 --> 48:40.948
It's a heavy power.

48:40.950 --> 48:46.420
Something that was born
out of decades of secrets.

48:46.422 --> 48:47.788
There is a darkness here.

48:47.790 --> 48:51.659
Yeah.
I mean, it's here.

48:51.661 --> 48:54.261
I don't feel Bobby here.

48:54.263 --> 48:58.666
It's something that wants
you to believe it's Bobby.

48:58.668 --> 49:00.768
What?

49:00.770 --> 49:03.304
What does that mean?

49:03.306 --> 49:08.242
This house has an
energy all its own.

49:08.244 --> 49:11.946
So are we going to have
a séance or something?

49:11.948 --> 49:13.998
No, no.

49:13.999 --> 49:16.199
- I means, that depends on...
- Depends on what?

49:18.087 --> 49:19.620
You said you knew
how to contact him.

49:19.622 --> 49:22.123
Annie brought you up here to
find out what was in this house.

49:22.125 --> 49:23.975
- Paul...
- No.

49:23.976 --> 49:25.826
May, you can't give Annie
all this hope

49:25.828 --> 49:27.828
and then not deliver
on anything at all.

49:27.830 --> 49:31.332
We don't need to find
the darkness here, Paul.

49:33.069 --> 49:35.836
It's everywhere.

49:43.179 --> 49:45.913
[wind blowing]

49:47.316 --> 49:49.550
[snoring]

50:01.230 --> 50:03.831
[wind blowing]

50:24.887 --> 50:27.121
[floor creaking]

50:34.597 --> 50:36.864
Hello?

50:42.605 --> 50:44.538
Jacob?

50:44.540 --> 50:47.408
Do you need something?

50:49.579 --> 50:51.412
May?

50:58.888 --> 51:02.423
[whispering]

51:02.425 --> 51:04.491
No...

51:09.165 --> 51:10.165
Hello?

51:10.499 --> 51:13.500
[fire crackling]

51:20.810 --> 51:23.611
[door creaks open]

51:26.916 --> 51:29.083
[whispering]

51:29.085 --> 51:31.518
No! No!

51:31.520 --> 51:32.586
- May...
- No!

51:32.588 --> 51:35.289
- May, May...
- There's so much death!

51:36.659 --> 51:39.260
Annie.
Annie, wake up.

51:39.262 --> 51:40.661
Annie!

51:41.130 --> 51:43.030
Annie!

51:43.799 --> 51:47.167
[screaming]

51:49.572 --> 51:52.273
You're alright.
You're alright.

51:52.275 --> 51:53.941
You're alright.

51:53.943 --> 51:56.977
<i>- You're okay.
- Bobby?</i>

51:57.947 --> 52:00.114
Did you hear that?

52:05.454 --> 52:08.455
[wind blowing]

52:32.982 --> 52:35.849
We had, uh...

52:35.851 --> 52:38.652
We had an encounter last night.

52:40.456 --> 52:43.490
Yeah, I, uh...

52:43.492 --> 52:45.726
You what, Paul?

52:48.564 --> 52:51.165
I saw something, too.

52:53.803 --> 52:56.971
I don't know what I saw, I just
want to know what's going on.

52:56.973 --> 52:59.540
Well, I heard Bobby.

53:06.415 --> 53:07.881
I need some air.

53:07.883 --> 53:10.050
Um, I have to go out
and get some groceries.

53:10.052 --> 53:11.652
You should come along.

53:11.654 --> 53:14.088
The boys can stay here.

53:14.090 --> 53:16.757
A little male-bonding
might do them good.

53:16.759 --> 53:18.292
You guys think you
can handle that?

53:18.294 --> 53:20.227
Yeah.

53:20.229 --> 53:22.329
What do you think
we're going to do, baby?

53:22.331 --> 53:26.033
Start conducting a séance
the second you leave?

53:26.035 --> 53:29.003
Go on.
Go on.

53:33.075 --> 53:34.575
Here are the keys,
if you want to drive.

53:34.577 --> 53:36.677
I'll drive.

53:36.679 --> 53:37.911
Not my car, she won't.

53:37.913 --> 53:40.381
Don't worry.
We can take May's car.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.483
Back in an hour.

53:45.287 --> 53:47.287
I love you.

53:48.624 --> 53:51.025
Oh, no-no-no.

53:51.027 --> 53:53.260
Can we take your car?

54:03.305 --> 54:04.772
Uh, Jake?

54:04.774 --> 54:07.041
Yes, Paul?

54:07.043 --> 54:09.109
What's going on, dude?

54:09.111 --> 54:14.081
We are conducting a séance.

54:14.083 --> 54:16.550
Excuse me?

54:16.552 --> 54:19.420
You should've seen May
last night, man.

54:19.422 --> 54:24.158
She said she was
surrounded by death.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.293
And I just heard no séance.

54:26.295 --> 54:27.895
You think she'd
be okay with this?

54:27.897 --> 54:30.497
Absolutely not,

54:30.499 --> 54:33.267
which is why we're
going to do it right now.

54:34.670 --> 54:37.104
Come on, man, sit.

54:40.142 --> 54:43.110
[church bell ringing]

54:47.116 --> 54:49.116
It felt like the weight
of the world,

54:49.118 --> 54:51.385
just crushing my soul.

54:51.387 --> 54:53.120
God...

54:54.256 --> 54:57.157
There's something in that
house that feels infernal,

54:57.159 --> 55:01.128
something that I've
never felt before.

55:01.130 --> 55:02.930
What does that mean exactly?

55:02.932 --> 55:06.600
Something's not right
in that house.

55:06.602 --> 55:08.268
Is that so?

55:08.270 --> 55:11.004
- Oh, hi, Dave.
- Hi, Annie.

55:11.006 --> 55:12.840
And who is this
lovely young lady?

55:12.842 --> 55:14.174
This is my friend, May.

55:14.176 --> 55:17.010
She and her husband are visiting
with us for the weekend.

55:17.012 --> 55:18.745
Oh, how nice.

55:18.747 --> 55:21.849
Well, it's an honest-to-God
pleasure, Miss May.

55:21.851 --> 55:23.283
How's Cat doing?

55:23.285 --> 55:26.153
Oh, she's fine, just fine.

55:26.155 --> 55:28.122
Check-up with the doctor.

55:28.124 --> 55:29.723
And you're...

55:29.725 --> 55:32.025
Oh, just wandering the streets

55:32.027 --> 55:35.195
and eavesdropping on
lovely young ladies.

55:35.197 --> 55:39.333
Miss May, did I hear you
correctly saying there's, uh...

55:39.335 --> 55:42.870
something not quite right
with Annie's house?

55:44.773 --> 55:46.173
I'd be surprised
if there wasn't,

55:46.175 --> 55:48.308
I mean,
with that kind of past.

55:48.310 --> 55:50.177
That house probably
has more demons

55:50.179 --> 55:53.480
than the Book of Revelations.

55:53.482 --> 55:56.216
Is it true
what happened up there?

55:56.218 --> 55:58.986
Running the Dagmars out of town?

55:58.988 --> 56:02.256
Oh, it's true.
Hand to the Lord.

56:02.258 --> 56:05.592
Because I saw a family
there last night.

56:06.929 --> 56:09.163
You did?

56:12.034 --> 56:16.370
May has... abilities.

56:16.372 --> 56:19.740
Well, I'd say she
certainly does.

56:22.011 --> 56:24.811
We need to get back, Annie.

56:28.217 --> 56:30.217
- I'm sorry, Dave.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

56:30.219 --> 56:32.219
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Annie.

56:32.221 --> 56:34.721
Bye, Miss May.

56:42.364 --> 56:48.735
So, I'm just going to read
a few lines here

56:48.737 --> 56:55.475
and see if we can connect to
whatever is in the house, okay?

56:57.246 --> 57:01.782
So, you just sit there and um,
maybe close your eyes

57:01.784 --> 57:09.784
and just try to believe
what we're doing is real.

57:17.266 --> 57:23.003
It's just so helpful
if you're in a zone.

57:36.285 --> 57:41.154
We are addressing
any spirits here.

57:41.156 --> 57:44.558
This house belongs
to the living.

57:44.560 --> 57:48.195
Their names are Paul and Anne,

57:48.197 --> 57:53.333
and they have a connection
to your world.

57:53.335 --> 57:59.339
Their son Bobby is with you.

57:59.341 --> 58:05.212
And if it's Bobby's spirit
that we have felt,

58:05.214 --> 58:10.284
please, give us a sign.

58:15.124 --> 58:17.324
[distant bang]

58:37.313 --> 58:41.281
This house welcomes his spirit

58:41.283 --> 58:46.920
and asks him to join us.

58:46.922 --> 58:52.726
And with love and compassion,

58:52.728 --> 58:58.732
we will help him
cross to the next realm...

58:58.734 --> 59:02.769
and peel...

59:02.771 --> 59:04.938
the skin...

59:04.940 --> 59:06.840
off...

59:06.842 --> 59:08.542
his...

59:08.544 --> 59:10.510
bones.

59:10.512 --> 59:13.480
What did you say?

59:15.484 --> 59:18.719
It's a...
it's a welcoming.

59:18.721 --> 59:24.391
We try to connect to
the... to the spirit

59:24.393 --> 59:28.362
by asking them into our circle.

59:28.364 --> 59:32.632
And so, you know,
I'm asking my son to join us.

59:32.634 --> 59:35.268
My son.

59:35.270 --> 59:37.637
Bobby.
My son.

59:38.874 --> 59:41.441
Yeah.

59:41.443 --> 59:43.477
Sorry. Sorry.

59:43.479 --> 59:50.384
I mean, it's a sacred blessing
to those we hold dear,

59:50.386 --> 59:56.656
and so we ask Bobby to...

59:59.228 --> 01:00:00.761
rot...

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.396
like...

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:04.531
wasted... meat.

01:00:04.533 --> 01:00:07.801
This is bullshit.
I'm done.

01:00:09.004 --> 01:00:11.171
- It's not Bobby.
- What?

01:00:11.173 --> 01:00:12.406
It's not Bobby!

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:14.508
[wind blows]

01:00:15.277 --> 01:00:16.676
Ah!

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:29.823
[distorted]
Your boy is dead.

01:00:36.832 --> 01:00:39.366
He's in the cellar.

01:00:39.368 --> 01:00:44.171
He and his little whore.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:53.113
They're downstairs burning.

01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:55.649
The both of them.

01:00:57.553 --> 01:01:04.458
Burning like my whole family.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.895
Burning until the stars go dark.

01:01:12.401 --> 01:01:14.034
Fuck! Paul!

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:15.753
Paul!

01:01:15.754 --> 01:01:17.471
- Paul, tie me up, man!
- Are you nuts?!

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.840
Get a rope or something, man!

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.108
Hurry up, man!

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:23.877
Tie me up!

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.746
Ah!

01:01:40.062 --> 01:01:41.528
What is it?

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:43.096
That Dave?

01:01:43.098 --> 01:01:45.499
He seems a little off.

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:48.268
He's just a harmless old man.

01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:53.373
I still don't see Harry's car.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:55.509
May, don't worry about it.

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.544
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

01:01:57.546 --> 01:02:00.046
I don't want them
coming up here.

01:02:00.048 --> 01:02:02.115
None of us should
be staying here, Annie.

01:02:02.117 --> 01:02:04.251
May...

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.603
Help!

01:02:23.605 --> 01:02:25.305
Help!
It's Jacob.

01:02:25.307 --> 01:02:28.241
May, I believe it, all of it.
Help!

01:02:30.779 --> 01:02:32.913
Jacob?

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.483
What's going on?

01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:38.084
Jacob, he lit some candles

01:02:38.086 --> 01:02:39.953
and he started digging up
some weird...

01:02:39.955 --> 01:02:42.656
- I don't know, auras or
something after you left...
- Auras?!

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.491
Whatever the fuck
they're called, May!

01:02:44.493 --> 01:02:45.759
Look at him!

01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:48.128
[grunting]

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:04.844
Why, he's right!

01:03:04.846 --> 01:03:09.015
Dug up some devils
while you were out.

01:03:14.189 --> 01:03:16.189
What happened?

01:03:16.191 --> 01:03:20.193
This town is what happened.

01:03:23.932 --> 01:03:29.603
This is my house.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:33.974
He's...

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:34.674
Dagmar.

01:03:34.676 --> 01:03:36.076
[phone ringing]

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.078
What do we do?

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.653
What?

01:03:46.655 --> 01:03:48.622
I told you to leave.

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.657

He's got to be in there!

01:05:15.977 --> 01:05:19.713
This town murdered my family!

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:22.482
They sacrificed them
to the gods they dug up

01:05:22.484 --> 01:05:24.417
when they built this place!

01:05:24.419 --> 01:05:28.254
Nobody knew what was under this
house until it was too late.

01:05:28.256 --> 01:05:29.089

don't look at him!

01:06:12.067 --> 01:06:14.501

you're supposed to do.

You brought him with you
when you moved in.
