<i>OLDER TED; When you meet someone</i>
<i>special suddenly life is full of firsts,</i>

00:19.285 --> 00:20.718
<i>The first kiss,</i>

00:20.820 --> 00:22.549
<i>The first night together,</i>

00:22.655 --> 00:24.680
<i>The first weekend together,</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:29.319
<i>For me, all those firsts happened</i>
<i>within 48 hours of meeting Victoria,</i>

00:29.763 --> 00:32.664
They've gotta come out soon. It's Monday.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.467
Do you think they've been in there
the whole time?

00:35.568 --> 00:38.435
I don't know whether to be proud
or concerned.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.836
Maybe they're not even in there.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.672
- Morning.
- Hey, guys.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.975
- I'm just gonna ignore that.
- Thank you.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.611
- I wish you could stay.
- I know. Me, too.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.743
But I have to go to work,
and you have that meeting.

00:53.853 --> 00:57.220
- Call you afterwards?
- I'll inappropriately text you during.

00:58.691 --> 00:59.953
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.823
- Bye.
- Oh, Victoria. You're here...

01:01.928 --> 01:03.259
Toodle-oo!

01:05.364 --> 01:07.026
Two days straight!

01:07.133 --> 01:10.000
Wow! Your room must smell
like a monkey cage.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.798
Come on, give us a number.
Lily guessed eight,

01:11.905 --> 01:15.068
- but I know my boy got the double digits!
- Zero.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.230
- What?
- What?

01:16.342 --> 01:17.775
Guys, we just met.

01:17.877 --> 01:20.812
And we both screwed up relationships
in the past by jumping in too quick.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.144
So we talked about it
and we decided to take this one slow.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.342
- Her idea.
- Totally her idea!

01:25.785 --> 01:27.753
But I don't know. I'm really into this girl.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.950
And if going slow is what it takes
to make this happen, I say, bring it on.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.056
I don't feel so good.

01:36.162 --> 01:39.188
It's like my testicles
mixed pop rocks and soda.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.597
I can't believe she's making you wait
a whole month.

01:41.701 --> 01:42.998
I would never put up with that.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.128
You've only had sex with one girl
in your whole life.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.466
Burn!

01:46.573 --> 01:48.700
Ted, the only reason to wait
a month for sex

01:48.808 --> 01:51.641
is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.377
Good news! I don't have to cover
the cat show tomorrow night.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.675
Who's up for hanging out?

01:55.782 --> 01:57.773
Oh, I can't.
I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.819
Oh, we can't.
It's our nine-year anniversary.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.947
Wow! Nine years?
Your relationship's a fourth grader.

02:05.425 --> 02:07.290
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

02:07.393 --> 02:10.328
We're going to the Berkshires
for the maple syrup harvest.

02:10.430 --> 02:14.264
It's one of <i>New York</i> magazine's
top five romantic getaways on a budget.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.767
Who says sexual can't be sensible?

02:17.470 --> 02:20.234
Well, looks like it's gonna be
just you and me.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.500
Really?

02:22.008 --> 02:24.636
Actually, I was talking to my martini.

02:27.814 --> 02:27.981
- Ready to go?
- Hell, yeah.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.812
- Ready to go?
- Hell, yeah.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.544
Nothing better than a weekend
at a good bed-and-breakfast.

02:32.652 --> 02:36.247
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast
at 7:00 a.m. Sharp.

02:37.023 --> 02:40.959
Complimenting the owners
on their collection of needlepoint geese.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.119
Awkward conversations
with middle-aged couples

02:43.229 --> 02:45.356
trying to stave off divorce.

02:46.699 --> 02:50.396
Yeah, well, we'd better get going.
It's like a four-hour drive.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.903
And it's supposed to rain tonight.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.572
- Or we could just stay home.
- Maybe watch some TV?

02:57.677 --> 03:00.407
- Order in some Chinese.
- Szechwan Garden.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.541
- Are we really bailing?
- Hell, yeah.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.913
Good, 'cause this thing's empty.

03:10.723 --> 03:14.215
$100 says
when you turn around I say, "Wow!"

03:15.495 --> 03:18.362
Barney, this is the third time
you've hit on me by accident!

03:18.464 --> 03:20.898
It's one of the many risks
of the blind approach.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.527
It's usually a two-man operation
where Ted signals if the target is hot.

03:24.637 --> 03:27.936
But Ted's too busy
being in a lesbian relationship.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.875
Why don't you just check out
the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?

03:31.978 --> 03:34.606
You can't... Wow!

03:34.914 --> 03:37.280
Hey! What's taking so long?

03:37.784 --> 03:40.753
- I gotta go.
- Not so fast, Scherbatsky.

03:41.187 --> 03:44.281
I like the way you think. That mirror thing.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.624
Simple. Elegant.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.486
Okay, limited time offer.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.064
I need a bro,
for my bro-ings-on about town.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.565
How would you like to be said bro?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.660
Well, as tempting as that sounds,

03:56.769 --> 03:59.203
I'm hanging out with my friend
who just got dumped.

03:59.305 --> 04:04.174
She really needs some support,
or a stranger's tongue down her throat.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.307
That seems healthy.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.848
All right! Guess I'm in.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.514
So, one more week and it'll be a month.

04:16.990 --> 04:21.086
Really, are you sure? Wow.
That snuck up on me.

04:21.361 --> 04:22.658
Oh, come on!

04:22.762 --> 04:25.253
The 18th can't get here fast enough.

04:25.465 --> 04:26.989
Wait, the 18th?

04:27.300 --> 04:31.703
Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this.
I'm gonna be out of town on the 18th.

04:31.804 --> 04:36.605
Oh, well, we can just wait
until you get back.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.644
I mean, the whole point
was not to rush into this.

04:39.746 --> 04:42.010
Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.810
75th and Amsterdam.

04:49.555 --> 04:52.217
I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.122
Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone?

04:54.227 --> 04:56.422
We'd be just getting there now,
all tired and cranky.

04:56.529 --> 04:59.293
And yet, we'd feel obligated to have sex.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.266
Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.870
I would like to propose a toast

05:08.341 --> 05:11.333
to the most
awesomely mellow anniversary ever.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.951
I'm so glad you have to go
to your parents next weekend.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.524
I'm so glad your roommates
are out of town.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.023
(WHISPERING)
Oh, my God! What are they doing home?

05:28.127 --> 05:30.152
They think we went away.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.433
Oh, it is on for my boy Ted!

05:35.535 --> 05:37.935
But we didn't go away.
We're in the bathroom.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.972
Well, they don't know that.
All we have to do is hide out in here

05:41.074 --> 05:43.975
until Ted moves his mojo
into the bedroom.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.641
But I don't want to hide out in here.

05:46.746 --> 05:50.147
Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind
waiting for this.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.649
If we go out there and spoil the mood,
it's not gonna happen.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.686
Then one of us is gonna
have to have sex with Ted.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.584
(SCOFFS) And, not gonna be me.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.222
Okay, fine.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.387
I guess I'll actually floss.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.629
You suited up!

06:11.738 --> 06:15.504
Well, I figured if I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do this right.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.439
Emilio, the woman will have...

06:17.543 --> 06:19.875
I'll have a Johnnie Walker Blue, neat,

06:19.979 --> 06:22.447
and a Montecristo No. 2. Thanks.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.843
The No. 2. A.k. A the Torpedo.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.444
Or, as the rulers call it, Piramide.

06:31.190 --> 06:35.320
My father was a cigar fanatic.
It was the only way to get his attention.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.828
Father issues. Hot.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.390
I know.
I was this close to being a huge slut.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.795
Slut would have been better.
But I'll settle for bro.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.465
Especially now that Ted's with Victoria
and can't drink.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.404
Because he's pregnant.
'Cause he's the girl.

06:53.513 --> 06:58.280
Oh, come on. Ted can't be pregnant.
You need to have sex to get pregnant.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.520
What up! Freeze frame, high five!

07:05.591 --> 07:05.691
I think this may be a perfect moment.

07:05.691 --> 07:08.182
I think this may be a perfect moment.

07:09.195 --> 07:12.096
- I wish we could hold on to it forever.
- No.

07:13.065 --> 07:16.432
Because the beauty of a moment
is that it's fleeting.

07:17.036 --> 07:20.733
By its very nature,
it slips through our fingers.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.242
Making it that much more precious.

07:26.412 --> 07:27.936
That is bad.

07:28.047 --> 07:32.211
That is like
high-school-literary-magazine bad!

07:32.752 --> 07:34.845
(WHISPERING) And they're not even high.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.047
And it's actually working.

07:37.156 --> 07:41.217
Yeah, super slowly.
God, close the deal already.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.428
It's been like 45 minutes.
We could've had sex three times by now.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.498
- Yeah, try five!
- What up.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.431
Hey, maybe we should just go out there.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.061
No way! We can't go out there now.

07:53.172 --> 07:56.107
They'll know that we've been
sitting in the bathroom the whole time.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.234
- It'll be too weird.
- Fine.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.237
But if we're stuck in here,
I'm turning up the volume.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.751
I want to know you.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.987
Like, know your soul.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.456
Ted, what makes you cry?

08:19.465 --> 08:23.162
Honey, could you hold my hair back?
I think I'm gonna hurl.

08:25.538 --> 08:28.803
So, what do you and Ted
usually do after the cigar bar?

08:29.208 --> 08:31.904
Are you kidding? Ted's never been here.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.804
You've already flown higher and faster
than he ever did.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.772
- Still.
- What?

08:41.687 --> 08:45.714
There is one other thing we could do.
If you're up for it.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.524
I had no idea laser tag still existed!

08:52.632 --> 08:54.657
Yeah, well, enjoy it
before it becomes cool again.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.894
- I give it two months.
- Oh, I believe it. This is awesome!

08:57.003 --> 08:58.664
Okay, follow my lead, stay low,

08:58.771 --> 09:01.467
and never underestimate
a 12-year-old with a...

09:01.574 --> 09:03.735
Scherbatsky! You gotta focus!

09:05.077 --> 09:07.910
- You just saved my life, didn't you?
- Thank me later.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.506
Let's keep moving.
These little bastards are everywhere.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.084
(YELLING)

09:16.489 --> 09:18.821
He's just staring into her eyes!

09:19.058 --> 09:22.494
I don't know. We used to be
even more nauseatingly into each other

09:22.595 --> 09:25.723
than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.

09:25.831 --> 09:28.891
Yeah, now we just make fun
of people like that.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.537
It's the circle of life.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.802
I'm serious, Marshall.

09:34.140 --> 09:37.166
I mean, we couldn't even get it up
to go on our big trip.

09:37.276 --> 09:40.712
And now we're celebrating our anniversary
stuck in a bathroom.

09:40.813 --> 09:43.509
Well, it's not fair to compare us
to Ted and Victoria.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.811
I mean, this is their first time.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.944
Yeah, but we could still have
some more romance.

09:49.055 --> 09:52.320
Now you just say, "Wanna do it,"
and I say, "Yeah."

09:54.126 --> 09:55.593
- Wanna...
- No!

09:58.097 --> 10:00.395
Maybe we're just out of firsts.

10:10.843 --> 10:13.334
Looks like they're about to have theirs.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.848
Should we take this to the bedroom?

10:20.953 --> 10:21.942
- Yes!
- Yes!

10:23.155 --> 10:24.213
Yes.

10:24.323 --> 10:25.620
- Yes!
- Yes!

10:27.026 --> 10:28.220
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

10:29.195 --> 10:31.163
No! No, don't answer it.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.566
You can answer it. We have all night.

10:35.668 --> 10:40.105
- You're answering it? He's answering it!
- No! Do her! Do her now!

10:41.073 --> 10:43.098
Sure. Good luck with that.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.471
Sorry about that.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.911
How about a little more wine?

10:49.015 --> 10:51.575
- I'll get another bottle.
- Okay.

10:53.185 --> 10:56.916
I need a drink.
Do we have any cough syrup in here?

10:57.657 --> 10:58.783
(SHUSHING)

11:04.163 --> 11:06.893
- Ambush! Ambush! Ambush!
- Oh, God!

11:06.999 --> 11:09.263
These brats have us
completely surrounded!

11:09.368 --> 11:11.461
I counted nine, maybe ten.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.763
I'll lay down some cover fire.
You make a run for it.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.101
No! Leave no man behind.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.141
Either we all get out of here,
or no one does.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.973
- But, I...
- Don't be a hero, Scherbatsky!

11:20.079 --> 11:22.070
See you on the other side.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.281
Mother!

11:29.955 --> 11:31.013
(GUNS FIRING)

11:32.158 --> 11:34.752
Damn. Wanna go get a soft pretzel?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.452
- Yeah.
- All right.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.761
Marshall, what happened to us?

11:40.866 --> 11:44.996
I mean, we used to just stare
into each others' eyes all night long.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.065
Have we lost that?

11:48.374 --> 11:49.534
Maybe.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.471
But I think I just found it.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.747
Right here.

11:59.285 --> 12:05.087
Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering
with just-a-hint-of-crazy eyes.

12:07.093 --> 12:11.530
Okay, well,
get ready for my sex-ray vision.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.698
Did you remember to pick up
the dry cleaning?

12:19.805 --> 12:21.067
- Oh, damn it!
- It's all right.

12:21.173 --> 12:24.665
- We can do this. We can do this.
- Let's just hold hands.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.614
This is nice.

12:30.449 --> 12:31.473
Yeah.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.850
You love that move!
It's the classic Marshall.

12:37.456 --> 12:40.323
Great. We totally suck at this.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.259
And we really,
really need to get out of here!

12:43.362 --> 12:44.886
Well, we can't.

12:45.498 --> 12:49.025
Baby, there's something I have to do.
And if I do it in front of you,

12:49.135 --> 12:52.730
it'll change the entire nature
of our relationship.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.739
- What is it?
- I have to pee.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.345
This is bad.

13:02.815 --> 13:06.114
We've gone nine years
without peeing in front of each other.

13:06.218 --> 13:09.278
You always think there'll be more time.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.685
Look at us.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.988
We're basically an old married couple
and we're not even married yet.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.186
The flame of our romance is flickering

13:17.296 --> 13:20.891
and if I pee all over it,
it might go out forever!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.325
How much longer do you think
you can hold it?

13:23.435 --> 13:27.667
I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew
during that <i>Quantum Leap</i> marathon.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.168
Oh, boy.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.603
Playing laser tag really takes me back.

13:35.714 --> 13:39.980
And you know what game I really miss?
Battleship. I've never lost a game.

13:40.085 --> 13:43.282
- Neither have I. Of course, I cheat.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.153
The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier
so it makes an "L."

13:46.258 --> 13:48.624
I always just stacked the ships
on top of each other.

13:48.727 --> 13:52.128
Nice! You know,
we should have a cheaters grudge match.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.290
I think I still have a...

13:54.633 --> 13:57.124
Hello. Target acquired.
Hottie by the jukebox.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.704
Oh, good eye, Scherbatsky.

13:59.805 --> 14:02.899
I got someone for you. Two o' clock.
Blue shirt.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.534
That's a woman.

14:05.644 --> 14:08.772
Oh, my mistake. Or is it?

14:10.149 --> 14:12.879
- Let's just focus on your target.
- Right.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.151
There. I got this one.

14:20.659 --> 14:23.560
Oh, my God! I love your jeans!

14:24.230 --> 14:28.030
Okay, is this a lesbian bar?
Because that girl with the blue shirt just...

14:28.133 --> 14:30.658
Oh, no. I am all about the dudes.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.767
Although, pickings are pretty slim tonight.

14:32.872 --> 14:37.241
Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit,
and he's playing hard to get.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.779
(LAUGHS) Really?
'Cause he's totally vibing me right now.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.643
Must be the jeans.

14:44.950 --> 14:49.148
Well, jeans will only get you so far.
I'm going home with him.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.653
We'll see about that.

15:03.636 --> 15:07.072
Oh, my God, I hate Ted!
I hate him so much!

15:07.640 --> 15:09.540
Baby, why don't you just go?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.735
Tons of other couples have
peed in front of each other.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.141
I know, but we haven't

15:13.245 --> 15:16.408
because I want to keep
some of the mystery alive.

15:16.782 --> 15:21.583
- Well, you have farted in front of me.
- Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.311
You always do.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.261
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:32.364 --> 15:33.991
Let's get outta here.
Let's go somewhere else.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.464
Well, what happened?

15:35.567 --> 15:38.297
Sometimes I like to do
a little catch-and-release.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.635
- But why?
- Leave no man behind.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.243
Either we all score, or no one scores.

15:46.512 --> 15:47.774
Right on.

15:48.213 --> 15:50.909
- Hey, you wanna go play Battleship?
- Hit!

16:05.664 --> 16:08.690
Ted, I can't wait any longer.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.396
- Should we move to the bedroom?
- There's no time for that.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.037
So, they can suck on each others' fingers
for an hour,

16:17.142 --> 16:19.770
but there's no time
to take two steps to the bedroom?

16:19.878 --> 16:22.972
Baby, I can't hold it in any longer!
It's time!

16:23.849 --> 16:25.009
I know.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.812
- I love you, Marshall.
- I love you, Lily.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.322
Here we go.

16:37.429 --> 16:40.796
You know, Barney, I had a surprisingly
good time bro-ing out tonight.

16:40.899 --> 16:44.096
Well, you make a good bro.
You're a better Ted than Ted.

16:44.203 --> 16:48.970
Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself
an invite to Marshall's bachelor party.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.065
And you don't even have
to come out of the cake.

16:51.176 --> 16:55.169
Thanks. And thanks
for sticking around tonight.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.543
I hope you're ready
for some hardcore Battleship.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.140
Come on, boys.

17:01.820 --> 17:05.347
"Hardcore"? That's the only way I play.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.324
Oh, I found it. Are you ready to...
What the hell are you doing?

17:17.102 --> 17:21.402
I'm birthday-suiting up. I'm sorry.
Did you want to undress me?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.569
No! I thought we were
just hanging out as friends!

17:24.675 --> 17:27.873
Oh, come on! You have been
throwing yourself at me all night!

17:27.980 --> 17:31.143
What? I did the opposite!
I threw some other girl at you!

17:31.250 --> 17:34.947
You invited me up to your apartment
to "play Battleship"!

17:35.054 --> 17:37.852
Is that not an internationally
recognized term for sex?

17:37.956 --> 17:38.945
No!

17:40.526 --> 17:41.686
Great.

17:42.361 --> 17:45.990
I hope you're happy.
You sunk my battleship.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.232
I'm okay. Are you okay?

17:55.707 --> 18:00.076
I feel the same.
And, yet, strangely different.

18:01.447 --> 18:05.383
Yeah, I'm happy for my bladder,
yet sad for us.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.551
Look, you had to do it, sweetie. For Ted.

18:10.355 --> 18:13.813
And, hey, look, at least now
we can stay in here as long as it takes.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.362
Yeah, I guess our relationship
had to take a hit,

18:17.463 --> 18:20.057
so a new one out there could blossom.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.297
Oh, crap!

18:26.038 --> 18:27.972
They must've heard that.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.775
Well, I guess we can come out now.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.751
I don't believe it, they're gone.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.689
Good. 'Cause I gotta take a whiz.

18:50.162 --> 18:52.562
Okay. You and me? That's insane.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.325
If you even thought about it
for one second...

18:54.433 --> 18:57.402
But I have thought about it for
three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.403
We both think
the marriage-commitment thing's a drag.

18:59.505 --> 19:04.101
We both want something casual and fun.
And we clearly get along really well.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.937
Wow, that actually did make
a lot of sense.

19:08.046 --> 19:11.345
- But what about Ted?
- I checked with Ted.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.943
Hey, Ted. So now that things
with you and Victoria are going pretty well

19:14.052 --> 19:16.452
I assume you're probably over
all the girls you were into before, right?

19:16.555 --> 19:17.988
I take your silence as a yes,
so, ergo, therefore,

19:18.090 --> 19:20.024
say I were to hook up with someone,
say, I don't know, Robin,

19:20.125 --> 19:22.889
- you'd be cool with that, right?
- Sure, good luck with that.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.287
Totally gave us his blessing.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.661
- Really?
- Really.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.831
So, Ted didn't care
that you wanted to make a move on me?

19:31.937 --> 19:33.632
Didn't care at all.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.408
- What?
- You like Ted!

19:44.516 --> 19:48.111
- I didn't say that I liked Ted, I...
- You like Ted!

19:48.220 --> 19:51.121
Wow! This is huge.

19:51.223 --> 19:54.715
Barney, I don't like Ted.
He's moved on and I'm really happy for...

19:54.826 --> 19:58.284
Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna
play Battleship or what?

20:07.239 --> 20:09.707
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

20:11.543 --> 20:14.876
No. That's the bro code.

20:16.014 --> 20:20.178
A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro
that a third bro has a crush on him.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.519
Just like the third bro
doesn't tell the mutual bro

20:23.622 --> 20:27.058
that the original bro
went bare pickle in front of her.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.688
It's quid pro bro.

20:31.129 --> 20:32.153
A7.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.925
- Miss.
- Of course.

20:35.968 --> 20:39.995
Well, we still have one frontier left.
Still got the deuce.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.839
You're not making me feel better.

20:45.844 --> 20:48.142
Well, it certainly was a first.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.815
It was, wasn't it?

20:52.818 --> 20:56.276
- We still have firsts.
- Of course we do.

20:56.755 --> 21:00.020
And you know what?
I actually feel closer to you now.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.752
I wanna know you.

21:02.394 --> 21:05.420
Like, know your soul.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.860
Marshall, what makes you cry?

21:11.470 --> 21:14.837
This moment is fleeting

21:16.174 --> 21:19.041
because it's being chased
by another moment.

21:20.145 --> 21:22.636
Oh, just grab my boob already!

21:26.151 --> 21:28.176
Come on, guys. Get a room.
