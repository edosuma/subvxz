WEBVTT

00:05.173 --> 00:07.408
OOH, THESE WILL MAKE
GREAT EARRINGS.

00:09.710 --> 00:13.714
MAN, FISHING IN ALASKA.
I WISH I WAS GOING.

00:13.781 --> 00:17.518
YEAH, ME TOO.
THEN I CAN HAVE YOUR ROOM.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.289
OKAY, KIDS. COME ON,
LETS LOAD UP THE CAR.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.799
CARL, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THOSE TINY PLANES.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.369
ONE BIG GUST OF WIND,
AND YOU'RE KISSING A GLACIER.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.639
RISK AND ADVENTURE IS THE WHOLE
POINT OF A TRIP LIKE THIS.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.909
STILL I WOULDN'T GO
ALL BY MYSELF.

00:41.975 --> 00:46.114
WELL, I'M OFF.

00:46.180 --> 00:52.586
WITH ALL THAT DUMPING, I HOPE
THE FISH ARE STILL JUMPING.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.901
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION
IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:07.968 --> 01:11.805
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:11.872 --> 01:15.109
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:15.176 --> 01:19.680
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:19.747 --> 01:22.916
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST
BE SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:22.983 --> 01:26.854
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:26.920 --> 01:30.491
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:30.558 --> 01:34.628
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:35.796 --> 01:38.566
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:38.632 --> 01:42.803
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:42.870 --> 01:45.339
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:45.406 --> 01:49.042
* BUT WE'LL SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

01:49.109 --> 01:52.546
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:52.613 --> 01:55.883
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

01:55.949 --> 02:00.321
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AND OPPORTUNITY *

02:00.388 --> 02:03.524
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:03.591 --> 02:07.161
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:22.410 --> 02:23.977
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.979
FRIENDLY,
FAMILY KIND OF FOLKS.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.981
HMM. NO WILD PARTIES?

02:28.048 --> 02:29.317
NOPE.

02:29.383 --> 02:33.554
DARN, AND I JUST
UNPACKED EVERYTHING.

02:33.621 --> 02:37.691
HARRIETTE, THERE'S A CAR
AT THE OLD HANSEN PLACE.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.295
I GUESS SOME SUCKER
FINALLY BOUGHT
THAT OLD SHACK.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.164
OH, HI.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.200
CARL, THIS IS
LORETTA McKAY.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.203
I'M THE SUCKER
WHO BOUGHT THE SHACK.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.407
WELL,
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.443
IT'S A FINE PLACE.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.511
SLAP A ROOF AND A FLOOR
ON THAT BABY,

02:57.578 --> 03:00.781
AND BINGO,
YOU GOT A HOUSE.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.984
UH, CARL USUALLY PUTS
HIS BEST FOOT FORWARD,

03:04.051 --> 03:06.687
INSTEAD OF IN HIS MOUTH.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.323
WELL, SIT DOWN.
LET'S SIT DOWN.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.192
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP--

03:12.260 --> 03:13.827
ACTUALLY, THERE IS.

03:13.894 --> 03:14.728
OH?

03:14.795 --> 03:17.431
HER HOT WATER HEATER
ISN'T WORKING.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.999
DOES IT
HAVE A RESUME?

03:19.066 --> 03:20.768
I COULD ASK AROUND.

03:24.772 --> 03:28.276
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M BLESSED
WITH WIT.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.513
COME ON, LORETTA.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.047
AND I'LL
MAKE DINNER.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.383
WELCOME TO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.551
THANKS FOR THE
COFFEE, HARRIETTE.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.787
YOU HAVE
A LOVELY HOME.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.854
WANT TO TRADE?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.757
FOR THAT OLD
SHACK? HA HA.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.262
YOU KNOW,
I REALLY APPRECIATE
THIS, CARL.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.565
HEY,
MY PLEASURE.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.634
HARRIETTE TOLD ME
HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE,

03:53.701 --> 03:57.871
BUT SHE DIDN'T MENTION
YOU'RE INCREDIBLY
HANDSOME, TOO.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.413
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.799
HI. YOU ORDERED
A ROOT BEER?

04:29.503 --> 04:32.105
YOU GOT A SEC,
MY LITTLE PITA POCKET?

04:32.172 --> 04:33.574
STEVE, I'M WORKING.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.843
AND THE SIGHT
IS SHEER POETRY.

04:35.909 --> 04:40.013
WHEN YOU SLING HASH,
THE ANGELS SING.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.214
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
STEVE?

04:41.281 --> 04:44.452
I HAVE
A PRESENT FOR YOU.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.753
"THE STAR REGISTRY"?

04:45.819 --> 04:48.622
I'VE ARRANGED TO HAVE
A STAR NAMED AFTER YOU.

04:48.689 --> 04:55.563
CELESTIAL OBJECT
NUMBER D42750-B-6218

04:55.629 --> 04:58.999
SHALL NOW
AND FOREVERMORE
BE CALLED "LAURA."

05:02.336 --> 05:04.137
REALLY?
THAT'S KIND OF NEAT.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.374
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT A HEAVENLY BODY

05:06.440 --> 05:08.842
BE NAMED AFTER
A HEAVENLY BODY.

05:08.909 --> 05:09.643
THANKS, STEVE.

05:09.710 --> 05:13.347
I HAVE TO ADMIT
I'M TOUCHED.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.282
REALLY,
MY LITTLE SUPERNOVA?

05:15.349 --> 05:18.952
ENOUGH TO ENGAGE
IN A LITTLE LIP WRESTLING?

05:19.019 --> 05:21.455
PIN ME, BABY.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.924
I'D RATHER
KISS A FLAGPOLE
ON A WINTER DAY.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.029
CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?

05:29.096 --> 05:30.964
I THINK
HE'S SWEET.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.366
EXCUSE ME?

05:32.433 --> 05:36.103
AND CUTE.
EXCUSE ME?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.505
YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.673
I WISH STEVE URKEL
LIKED ME.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.645
DON'T GO AWAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.446
STEVE,
WE NEED TO TALK.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.581
LET'S SIT DOWN.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.917
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,
MY CUTE LITTLE COMET?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.623
STEVE, HOW LONG
HAVE WE KNOWN EACH OTHER?

05:55.689 --> 05:56.924
NINE YEARS,
THREE MONTHS,

05:56.990 --> 05:58.225
TWO WEEKS,
FOUR DAYS,

05:58.291 --> 05:59.393
SIX HOURS,
EIGHT MINUTES,

05:59.460 --> 06:01.328
AND 14 SECONDS,

06:01.395 --> 06:02.796
15 SECONDS,

06:02.863 --> 06:04.565
16 SECONDS--

06:04.632 --> 06:06.166
THE WHOLE TIME
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER,

06:06.233 --> 06:09.503
YOU'VE BEEN PESTERING ME,
HOPING I'D FALL IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.271
IT'S MY MOST
CHERISHED DREAM.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.940
WELL, WAKE UP.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.478
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.346
THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE,
LAURA.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.649
WHAT IF WE'RE STRANDED ON
A DESERT ISLAND TOGETHER?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.885
I'M A STRONG SWIMMER.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.387
WHAT IF I WAS
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH

06:27.455 --> 06:29.089
AND YOU WERE
THE LAST WOMAN?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.591
MANKIND WOULD END WITH US.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.195
SO WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.765
I'M SAYING THAT
I WILL NEVER, NEVER,

06:37.831 --> 06:41.569
EVER, EVER
FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.905
LAURA, THAT CONCEPT'S
HARD TO GRASP.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.207
OKAY, THEN TRY THIS.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.610
A GIRL OVER THERE
THINKS YOU'RE SWEET
AND CUTE.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.517
WHOA, THAT CONCEPT'S
EVEN HARDER TO GRASP.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.418
COME ON.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.853
UH-UH.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.888
COME ON.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.530
SUSIE, STEVE URKEL.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.599
STEVE, SUSIE CRENSHAW.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.073
I'M JUST
A THIRD WHEEL HERE,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.576
SO I'LL JUST BE, UH...

07:27.848 --> 07:29.783
HI.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.884
HI.

07:32.352 --> 07:36.690
LAURA, IS STEVE
ACTUALLY SITTING
WITH ANOTHER GIRL?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.592
YEAH.
THAT'S SUSIE.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.861
SHE ACTUALLY
LIKES STEVE.

07:40.928 --> 07:44.064
EXCUSE ME?

07:44.131 --> 07:44.832
I GOT THEM TOGETHER,

07:44.898 --> 07:46.667
HOPING
THEY'D HIT IT OFF.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.537
THEN MAYBE
HE'D STOP BUGGING YOU.

07:49.603 --> 07:53.140
THAT'S THE PLAN,
BUT I DON'T
EXPECT IT TO WORK.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.844
DID YOU KNOW AN ELEPHANT
CAN BE PREGNANT
UP TO TWO YEARS?

07:59.847 --> 08:02.650
DID YOU KNOW
ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
SHAVED THEIR EYEBROWS

08:02.716 --> 08:06.086
TO MOURN THE DEATH
OF THEIR CATS?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.056
GEE, I WONDER
WHAT THEY SHAVED
WHEN A RELATIVE DIED.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.039
SO ME AND MY PARTNER
BURST THROUGH THE DOOR,

08:26.106 --> 08:28.008
AND THERE WE ARE,
STANDING FACE TO FACE

08:28.075 --> 08:32.546
WITH
A UNITED STATES SENATOR
AND HIS MISTRESS.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.915
WHOO. DID YOU
RECOGNIZE HIM RIGHT AWAY?

08:34.982 --> 08:38.986
NOT TILL HE TOOK OFF
THE ZORRO SUIT.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.522
OH, CARL, YOU TELL
THE MOST WONDERFUL STORIES.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.793
I'VE LIVED QUITE A LIFE.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.095
WANT TO COME IN
AND SAY HI TO HARRIETTE?

08:48.161 --> 08:51.464
I'VE MONOPOLIZED TOO MUCH
OF YOUR TIME ALREADY.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.867
BUT THANKS FOR LOOKING
AT MY WATER HEATER.

08:53.934 --> 08:54.902
MY PLEASURE.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.770
I'M JUST SORRY
I COULDN'T FIX IT.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.540
OH, AND
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
THAT LITTLE EXPLOSION.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.009
OH, DON'T WORRY.

09:02.075 --> 09:06.580
THAT WALL NEEDED
TO BE KNOCKED OUT ANYWAY.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.616
WELL, SEE YOU LATER,
LORETTA.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.785
UH, I HOPE IT'S
NOT TOO MUCH LATER.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.730
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

09:33.306 --> 09:33.941
CARL.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.308
WHAT?

09:38.311 --> 09:39.613
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

09:39.680 --> 09:43.083
UH...7:30...8:00.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.485
IT'S 9:06.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.754
YOU KNOW
THE OLD SAYING--

09:46.820 --> 09:49.156
TIME FLIES WHEN
YOU'RE HAVING--

09:50.758 --> 09:52.292
TO FIX
A WATER HEATER.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.262
DO YOU REALIZE
YOU MISSED DINNER?

09:55.328 --> 09:56.263
WELL, YEAH, BUT, UH--

09:56.329 --> 09:58.098
I MADE FLANK STEAK,

09:58.165 --> 09:59.499
MASHED POTATOES,

09:59.566 --> 10:01.134
AND BUTTER BEANS.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.235
OH, HONEY, GOOD.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.403
I'M STARVED.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.338
I ATE IT ALL.

10:07.074 --> 10:07.875
OH.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.344
WELL, I'LL
HAVE A POP TART.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.513
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL?

10:13.580 --> 10:15.482
WELL, HARRIETTE,
SHE JUST MOVED IN.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.817
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE PHONE HOOKED UP YET.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.252
YOU COULD
HAVE WALKED OVER.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.921
ALL THE WAY BACK--

10:20.988 --> 10:22.622
I SHOULD'VE
DONE THAT.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.991
I SHOULD'VE
DONE THAT.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.694
YOU DO REALIZE
WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE, DON'T YOU?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.561
I THINK SO.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.863
WE'RE HAVING
AN ARGUMENT,

10:29.930 --> 10:33.033
AND YOU ATE
MY DINNER.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.536
CARL WINSLOW, YOU
ARE THE MOST NAIVE MAN.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.672
THAT WOMAN WANTS YOU.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.541
FOR WHAT?

10:41.608 --> 10:45.312
FOR THE SAME REASON
THAT SENATOR WAS
WEARING THAT ZORRO SUIT.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.149
OH, NO!

10:49.216 --> 10:51.952
OH, YEAH!

10:52.019 --> 10:54.221
HARRIETTE,
YOU'RE WAY OFF BASE.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.857
I'M A WOMAN.
I KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.959
I'M A MAN.
I SENSE THEM.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.761
LORETTA McKAY
ISN'T AFTER ME.

11:00.828 --> 11:01.995
SHE THINKS OF ME

11:02.062 --> 11:05.999
AS A TIP-TOP,
NUMBER-ONE,
FIX-IT GUY.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.001
IT'S NOT HER
WATER HEATER

11:08.068 --> 11:10.203
SHE'S LOOKING
TO GET FIXED!

11:11.671 --> 11:12.706
WELL,
WHERE YOU GOING?

11:12.773 --> 11:15.108
TO FINISH OFF
THE POP TARTS!

11:31.124 --> 11:32.292
STEVE, LOOK.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.829
OH, YEAH, SWEET KNEES,
IT'S OUR TABLE.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.772
EXCUSE ME.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.383
THANK YOU, STEVE.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.419
THAT'S OKAY
IT WAS MY TURN.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.058
STEVE, YOU'RE 15 MINUTES
LATE FOR WORK.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.994
I HAD TO COVER
YOUR TABLES.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.630
SORRY. I WAS SHOPPING
WITH MY SUSE.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.566
I ONLY INTRODUCED
YOU GUYS A WEEK AGO,

12:13.633 --> 12:15.635
AND ALREADY
SHE'S YOUR SUSE?

12:15.702 --> 12:17.905
LAURA, I'M BUSY, OKAY?

12:19.539 --> 12:20.841
OKAY, MY LITTLE
CREPE SUZETTE,

12:20.908 --> 12:24.211
IT'S TIME FOR
YOUR DAILY PRESENT.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.482
STEVE, A LOCKET.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.218
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.786
ONLY WHEN
YOU WEAR IT.

12:32.853 --> 12:36.023
OH, URKIE.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.826
OH, PLEASE.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.565
LAURA?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.400
YOU OKAY, HONEY?

12:47.467 --> 12:48.668
I'M FINE.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.770
OH, GOOD. 'CAUSE
FOR A MOMENT OVER THERE,

12:50.838 --> 12:53.340
IT LOOKED LIKE YOU
WERE A LITTLE JEALOUS.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.708
BUT THAT'S SILLY, RIGHT?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.945
RIGHT.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.525
MOTHER WINSLOW,
WHAT TIME IS IT?

13:12.592 --> 13:15.929
ONE MINUTE LATER
THAN THE LAST TIME
YOU ASKED ME.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.869
CARL'S BEEN AT LORETTA'S
OVER AN HOUR.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.637
HOW LONG CAN IT TAKE
TO FIX A LEAKY FAUCET?

13:24.704 --> 13:28.976
CARL'S DOING IT,
SO IT MIGHT TAKE
TWO, THREE MONTHS.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.148
YOU'RE UPSET
WITH HIM,
AREN'T YOU?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.349
A LITTLE.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.952
I COULD TELL.
FOR THE PAST WEEK,

13:39.019 --> 13:41.554
YOU BEEN EATING UP
ALL HIS FAVORITE FOODS.

13:43.023 --> 13:47.694
MOTHER WINSLOW,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
LORETTA McKAY.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.029
I DON'T
BLAME YOU.

13:49.096 --> 13:53.033
THAT FLOOZY'S
TRYING TO STEAL
YOUR HUSBAND.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.534
YOU THINK SO, TOO?

13:54.601 --> 13:57.604
I'VE SEEN
HER KIND BEFORE.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.708
SHE'S
A MAN-BURGLAR.

14:01.774 --> 14:05.178
SHOULD I LOCK UP CARL
OR KNOCK LORETTA
UPSIDE THE HEAD?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.547
NO, YOU DO
SOMETHING ELSE,

14:07.614 --> 14:09.349
SOMETHING
MUCH HARDER.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.850
WHAT'S THAT?

14:10.918 --> 14:13.853
HONEY, YOU TRUST
YOUR HUSBAND.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.526
HELLO, STEVE?
SORRY TO GET YOU
OUT OF THE SHOWER.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.929
COULD YOU COME OVER
TOMORROW MORNING?

14:21.995 --> 14:25.132
WE NEED TO TALK.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,

14:25.198 --> 14:27.634
BUT I'D FEEL BETTER
IF I GET IT--

14:34.007 --> 14:36.143
I WOULD'VE
BEEN HERE SOONER,

14:36.209 --> 14:38.411
BUT MY MOM MADE ME
PUT ON A TOWEL.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.415
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.584
YOU AND THE SUSE.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.486
OHH.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.856
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT THE GREEN-EYED
MONSTER OF JEALOUSY

14:49.923 --> 14:52.559
IS REARING
ITS UGLY HEAD?

14:52.625 --> 14:53.560
ACTUALLY, IT WAS.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.261
AHA!

14:54.327 --> 14:56.629
FOR A SECOND.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.098
HMM.

14:58.165 --> 15:01.101
WHEN YOU CALLED
SUSIE PET NAMES
AND GAVE HER GIFTS--

15:01.168 --> 15:04.071
YOU WERE WILLING
TO DO ANYTHING,
EVEN MURDER,

15:04.137 --> 15:06.606
TO WIN ME BACK.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.676
STEVE, I'M TALKING.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.945
OH, SORRY.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.915
PAY ATTENTION
BECAUSE THIS IS
HARD TO EXPLAIN.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.385
STEVE, EVER SINCE
WE'VE MET,

15:18.451 --> 15:22.922
YOU'VE BEEN
LIKE A...WHINING,
BUZZING MOSQUITO.

15:23.790 --> 15:24.958
I KEEP SWATTING
AT YOU,

15:25.025 --> 15:27.294
BUT YOU REFUSE
TO BE SQUASHED.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.963
THAT'S ME--
THE UNSQUASHABLE URKEL.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.534
THEN YOU STARTED
BUZZING AROUND SUSIE.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.337
AND FOR A SECOND,
I ACTUALLY ALMOST MISSED

15:37.404 --> 15:40.107
YOUR OBNOXIOUS,
GRATING PRESENCE.

15:41.374 --> 15:45.278
THEN I CAME TO MY SENSES
AND ASKED YOU OVER

15:45.345 --> 15:48.448
TO TELL YOU I'M HAPPY
FOR YOU AND SUSIE.

15:48.515 --> 15:52.085
IN FACT, YOU GUYS
ARE THE PERFECT COUPLE.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.454
OH, WELL,
ACTUALLY...

15:55.855 --> 15:57.524
WE'RE
AN EX-COUPLE.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.658
SAY WHAT?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.060
WELL, A WEEK AGO,

16:00.127 --> 16:03.263
SUSIE WAS A SHY,
FRAGILE FLOWER
AFRAID TO OPEN.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.732
BUT I APPLIED A
GENEROUS SPRINKLING

16:05.798 --> 16:06.799
OF URKEL
MIRACLE GROW,

16:06.866 --> 16:10.370
AND LO AND BEHOLD,
SHE BLOSSOMED.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.805
AND I'M PROUD TO SAY
AN HOUR AGO,

16:12.872 --> 16:16.009
I INTRODUCED SUSIE
TO THE CAPTAIN
OF THE CHESS CLUB.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.011
WHAT? YOU WENT
THROUGH ALL THAT TROUBLE

16:18.078 --> 16:19.146
BRINGING HER
OUT OF HER SHELL

16:19.212 --> 16:22.282
JUST TO LOSE HER
TO DOYLE EASTERWOOD?

16:22.349 --> 16:27.520
THAT WAS MY INTENTION
ALL ALONG.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.490
HOWEVER,
MY MASTERFUL PLAN

16:30.557 --> 16:31.891
SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A...

16:31.958 --> 16:34.727
SERENDIPITOUS
SIDE EFFECT.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.532
YOU MISSED ME.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.867
FOR A SECOND.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.070
LONG ENOUGH
TO GIVE ME HOPE.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.805
I LOVE YOU,
LAURA.

16:45.872 --> 16:46.906
GO HOME, STEVE.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.742
AH, YES!
MUSIC TO MY EARS.

16:49.809 --> 16:50.977
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE
FRIDAY?

16:51.044 --> 16:52.312
DROP DEAD.

16:52.379 --> 16:56.049
TALK TO ME, BABY.
LET'S SEAL IT
WITH A KISS.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.519
I'D RATHER THROW UP.

16:59.586 --> 17:03.690
AH, YES! BANG! ZAP!
I'M ON FIRE!

17:03.756 --> 17:07.427
FORTUNATELY,
I HAVE A COLD
SHOWER WAITING.

17:07.494 --> 17:11.264
AH, YES! THE SMELL
OF FRESH DOOR
IN MY FACE!

17:16.669 --> 17:19.072
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.209
THANK YOU
FOR WALKING
ME HOME...AGAIN.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.877
THANK YOU FOR LOOKING
AT MY LEAKY FAUCET.

17:24.944 --> 17:25.978

17:26.045 --> 17:28.781
I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T FIX IT.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.820
AND I'M REAL SORRY
ABOUT THAT
LITTLE FLOOD.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.457
HEY, I ALWAYS
WANTED A JACUZZI.

17:40.927 --> 17:41.994
OH!

17:42.061 --> 17:44.297
I BROUGHT THIS ALL
THE WAY OVER HERE

17:44.364 --> 17:47.033
AND ALMOST FORGOT
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.869
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

17:49.936 --> 17:52.239
JUST
A LITTLE THANK YOU

17:52.305 --> 17:55.875
FOR ALL THE THINGS
YOU TRIED TO FIX.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.478
OH.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.748

18:01.814 --> 18:03.516
YEAH!

18:03.583 --> 18:07.487
THEY PLAY ONLY YOU
BY THE PLATTERS.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.857
I HOPE YOU DON'T
ALREADY HAVE THEM.

18:10.923 --> 18:11.824
NO, NO.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.860
THIS IS
MY VERY FIRST PAIR

18:13.926 --> 18:15.995
OF SINGING UNDERPANTS.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.797
OH.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.999
WHEW.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.902

18:22.969 --> 18:25.938
THIS IS AN AWFULLY
PERSONAL GIFT.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.540
ARE YOU EMBARRASSED?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.709
WELL, A LITTLE.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.245
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME OVER
TO MY PLACE

18:32.312 --> 18:35.114
AND TRY THEM ON?

18:38.718 --> 18:41.188
SAY WHAT?

18:41.254 --> 18:43.623
YOU KNOW,
MODEL THEM FOR ME?

18:48.228 --> 18:49.162
AM I MAKING YOU
NERVOUS?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.598
OH, NO, NO.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.500
OOH!

18:55.268 --> 18:56.969
A LITTLE.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.207

I'M ATTRACTIVE?

19:00.273 --> 19:03.009
OH, I THINK
YOU'RE VERY
ATTRACTIVE...

19:03.075 --> 19:05.144
VERY, VERY
ATTRACTIVE.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.647
STAY THERE.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.149
CARL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:10.217 --> 19:13.553
LORETTA,
I'M A MARRIED MAN.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.322
YEAH?

19:16.223 --> 19:18.325
DOESN'T THAT
BOTHER YOU?

19:18.391 --> 19:19.426
I JUST THOUGHT
WE COULD HAVE
A LITTLE FUN.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.462
NOW, LORETTA,
STOP THAT.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.466
LOOK, I CAN'T
CHEAT ON MY WIFE.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.534

HI, HONEY.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.165
CARL.

19:59.232 --> 20:02.569
SO. DID YOU FIX
WHATEVER LORETTA WANTED?

20:04.371 --> 20:06.339
SWEETHEART,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.708

MADE A PASS AT ME.

YEAH. GO AHEAD,

FOR FINGERPRINTS.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.921
YOU WON'T FIND MINE.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.258

OH, SWEETHEART...

20:28.127 --> 20:32.198
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I MADE YOU WORRY.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.933
YOU TRIED TO WARN ME
ABOUT LORETTA,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.669

LISTEN TO YOU.
