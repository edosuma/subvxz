WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:05.085
Good morning.

00:05.327 --> 00:07.293
You better not be
planning anything special

00:07.335 --> 00:08.698
for our anniversary tomorrow.

00:08.727 --> 00:10.594
Don't worry.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.277
I learned my lesson
last Valentine's Day.

00:12.322 --> 00:13.788
You're not a fan
of grand romantic gestures.

00:13.816 --> 00:14.798
Great.

00:14.867 --> 00:16.900
So, no white doves, Cupid costumes,

00:16.969 --> 00:20.003
or large boom boxes outside of our
window cranking Peter Gabriel?

00:20.072 --> 00:22.305
Not in that... order, no.

00:22.374 --> 00:24.407
Greg, this is our 18th anniversary,

00:24.476 --> 00:25.909
which is traditionally celebrated

00:25.978 --> 00:26.977
by not giving a crap.

00:27.045 --> 00:28.144
How's this for an idea?

00:28.213 --> 00:29.746
I get rid of the kids for a few hours,

00:29.815 --> 00:32.048
and then I make you tacos,
like I did on our first date.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.583
No kids and tacos?

00:33.652 --> 00:35.919
If I had to write a romance
novel, that would be the title.

00:35.988 --> 00:38.822
Mom, tell Anna-Kat
to stay out of my room.

00:38.891 --> 00:41.024
I'm gonna let you in
on a little parenting secret...

00:41.093 --> 00:42.993
I have very little control
over what she does.

00:43.061 --> 00:45.061
Oliver keeps trying on outfits

00:45.130 --> 00:47.898
for his date
with Gina Tuscadero tomorrow.

00:47.966 --> 00:49.799
By the way, this is his mirror face.

00:52.771 --> 00:54.704
So, you finally asked out
Gina from ballet class.

00:54.773 --> 00:56.006
Need any dating tips?

00:56.074 --> 00:57.107
No, I got this.

00:57.175 --> 00:58.508
Okay, but if you change your mind,

00:58.577 --> 01:00.277
there's a boom box with Gabriel
cued up in the basement.

01:01.313 --> 01:02.646
Gina is from South Branson, right?

01:03.682 --> 01:04.915
Finally.

01:04.983 --> 01:07.250
Somebody who can protect my baby
in a street fight.

01:09.087 --> 01:11.988
Trip, I think you misread
the welcome mat.

01:12.057 --> 01:13.557
Morning, Mrs. A.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.125
I'm here to pick Taylor up for school.

01:15.193 --> 01:16.860
Trip, it's "Mrs. O."

01:16.929 --> 01:20.764
"Otto" is spelled "O-T-T-O."

01:20.832 --> 01:22.332
Got it... like "automobile."

01:23.702 --> 01:25.335
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you.

01:25.404 --> 01:26.536
I like your shirt.

01:26.605 --> 01:28.405
Thanks. Shirts are awesome.

01:28.473 --> 01:30.273
I could wear a shirt, like, every day.

01:30.342 --> 01:31.207
Shirts.

01:32.344 --> 01:33.710
Is it possible Taylor's catching

01:33.779 --> 01:35.545
secondary idiocy from this guy?

01:35.614 --> 01:38.014
Let's face it,
she's already no Stephen...

01:38.083 --> 01:39.983
What's his name? The little
genius in the wheelchair?

01:40.052 --> 01:41.618
- Hawking.
- No.

01:41.687 --> 01:44.888
He talks through a computer.

01:44.957 --> 01:45.956
Hawking.

01:46.024 --> 01:47.757
I think it starts with a "V."

01:47.826 --> 01:48.925
I know you want to say "Van Zandt,"

01:48.994 --> 01:51.294
- but I promise you, it's Hawking.
- Whatever, Greg.

01:51.363 --> 01:53.563
I don't like the kid.
Taylor can do so much better.

01:53.632 --> 01:55.131
We got to do something.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.567
Maybe we shouldn't interfere and let
Taylor learn from her mistakes.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.003
Nah.

02:03.842 --> 02:05.008
Hello?

02:05.077 --> 02:06.810
Oh, hi, Principal Ablin.

02:06.878 --> 02:09.446
Ooh! Which one of our three
contestants will be grounded tonight?

02:09.514 --> 02:11.748
I am so sorry to hear that.

02:11.817 --> 02:14.451
Of course. We can come in this morning.

02:19.257 --> 02:20.757
What did you do...

02:24.329 --> 02:25.328
...Anna-Kat?

02:25.397 --> 02:26.496
- Yes!
- Yes!

02:26.565 --> 02:28.498
You're gonna get so grounded.

02:28.567 --> 02:32.302
You can take my life,
but you can never take my...

02:32.371 --> 02:35.205
freedom!

02:35.273 --> 02:36.906
You let her watch "Braveheart"?

02:36.975 --> 02:38.475
Just that snippet.

02:38.543 --> 02:40.577
"Every man dies. Not every man lives."

02:40.646 --> 02:42.312
And the rest of the movie.

02:43.482 --> 02:46.316

02:50.956 --> 02:52.722
Mr. and Mrs. Otto, as you may know,

02:52.791 --> 02:54.858
tomorrow is Candy-Gram Day
here at the school.

02:54.926 --> 02:57.060
It's one of our
more successful fundraisers

02:57.129 --> 02:58.461
for the last 18 years.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.997
Hey! Tomorrow's
also our 18th anniversary.

03:01.066 --> 03:02.432
I'm making tacos... nothing big.

03:02.501 --> 03:04.134
Honey, we're not here
to talk about marriage.

03:04.202 --> 03:05.902
- I was married once.
- Maybe we are.

03:05.971 --> 03:08.438
Then I found out my 28-year-old wife

03:08.507 --> 03:10.740
had been lying and was actually 61.

03:14.046 --> 03:15.378
Anyway...

03:15.447 --> 03:17.814
yesterday, your daughter told
a rather disturbing story

03:17.883 --> 03:19.182
to some of her classmates.

03:20.285 --> 03:21.885
Have you heard of Bloody Becky?

03:21.953 --> 03:23.119
No.

03:23.188 --> 03:25.355
She went to school here long, long ago.

03:25.424 --> 03:28.391
She was unhappy because all the
other kids didn't include her.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.293
Then, one day, she vanished!

03:31.630 --> 03:33.496
Years later, she appeared
in the school mirrors,

03:33.565 --> 03:35.799
her hair soaked in blood.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.634
Whenever she sees students having fun...

03:37.703 --> 03:40.303
like, say, passing out Candy-Grams...

03:40.372 --> 03:42.239
she jumps out of the mirror

03:42.307 --> 03:46.693
and eats their screaming faces off.

03:46.778 --> 03:48.078
There she is now!

03:51.983 --> 03:55.185
Her classmates got so scared,
they stopped buying Candy-Grams.

03:55.253 --> 03:56.953
We had to bring in a therapist
to assure them

03:57.022 --> 03:58.588
that it was safe to pass them out

03:58.657 --> 04:01.057
without fear of some toilet
witch eating their faces.

04:01.126 --> 04:03.526
That is so unlike her.

04:03.595 --> 04:05.361
<i>That is so like her.</i>

04:05.430 --> 04:07.731
<i>But I'm required to have
this baffled look on my face.</i>

04:07.799 --> 04:09.432
Don't worry.
We'll... We'll talk to Anna-Kat.

04:09.501 --> 04:10.300
Thank you.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:20.678 --> 04:22.011
How was I to know?

04:24.149 --> 04:26.950
Part of my job working for you
is to get you modernized.

04:27.018 --> 04:29.119
So instead of paging me on this beeper,

04:29.187 --> 04:30.920
you're gonna text me on your new phone.

04:30.989 --> 04:33.123
Oliver, I have seen smartphones before.

04:33.191 --> 04:35.125
Guys had them in prison.

04:35.193 --> 04:37.160
Hate to think how they smuggle them in.

04:37.229 --> 04:39.696
No, they just go to the Apple
Store in the prison mall.

04:41.733 --> 04:43.900
You got something on your mind?
You seem preoccupied.

04:43.969 --> 04:45.168
So, there's this girl Gina

04:45.237 --> 04:47.470
that I'm taking out tomorrow
for the first time,

04:47.539 --> 04:49.139
and I really want to impress her.

04:49.207 --> 04:51.775
You came to the right place.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.176
Follow these two rules,

04:53.245 --> 04:56.279
and she's guaranteed
to fall head over heels.

04:56.348 --> 04:58.548
Number one... be filthy rich.

04:58.617 --> 05:00.683
That'll be hard to pull off by tomorrow.

05:00.752 --> 05:01.985
Right.

05:02.053 --> 05:03.853
Number two...

05:03.922 --> 05:05.822
Actually, there was
never a need for number two,

05:05.891 --> 05:07.891
because number one worked so damn well.

05:11.396 --> 05:14.030
Bloody Becky? Anna-Kat! Really?

05:14.099 --> 05:16.633
I won't tell it again... promise.

05:16.701 --> 05:19.202
I just want stupid
Candy-Gram Day to be over.

05:19.271 --> 05:21.237
Honey, please don't ever
refer to candy as "stupid."

05:21.306 --> 05:22.939
I don't even remember you mentioning

05:23.008 --> 05:24.240
Candy-Gram Day last year.

05:24.309 --> 05:26.242
That's because I was
the only kid in the class

05:26.311 --> 05:27.377
that didn't get one.

05:29.848 --> 05:32.415
Honey, I'm sure
this year will be different.

05:32.484 --> 05:34.684
You're going to get
plenty of Candy-Grams.

05:34.753 --> 05:37.620
And we're not going to waste
another moment thinking about it.

05:37.689 --> 05:38.755
Okay?

05:38.824 --> 05:39.756
Okay.

05:44.329 --> 05:45.461
You're thinking about it, aren't you?

05:45.530 --> 05:46.529
Oh, yeah.

05:46.598 --> 05:48.565
I'm gonna get a list
of every little turd

05:48.633 --> 05:50.099
in Anna-Kat's class from last year

05:50.168 --> 05:52.068
and get my revenge one by one.

05:52.137 --> 05:53.503
It'll be like that movie "Munich,"

05:53.572 --> 05:54.804
except with Candy-Grams.

05:54.873 --> 05:56.372
What is it with you and revenge lists?

05:56.441 --> 05:59.042
I need a list. If I don't
write it down, I forget it.

06:00.579 --> 06:02.545
Look, I'm upset, too,
but there's something to be said

06:02.614 --> 06:04.581
for stepping back and
letting the kids work it out.

06:04.649 --> 06:06.749
Greg, you're not just given
the title "Overbearing Mom."

06:06.818 --> 06:08.384
You have to earn it.

06:08.453 --> 06:10.453
I'm just saying if we keep trying to
protect them from disappointment,

06:10.522 --> 06:11.754
they'll never learn to deal with it.

06:11.823 --> 06:14.390
Fine! You win.

06:14.459 --> 06:16.292
But you're dropping Anna-Kat off
in the morning.

06:16.361 --> 06:18.027
If I set foot in that school,
all bets are off.

06:18.096 --> 06:19.295
Done.

06:19.364 --> 06:21.631
And afterwards, I'll pick up
some taco ingredients...

06:21.700 --> 06:24.133
and arrange for a string
quartet to play while we eat.

06:24.202 --> 06:25.501
"No" to the quartet.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.170
And don't do that
fake-yawn-while-talking thing.

06:27.239 --> 06:28.738
It's childish.

06:28.807 --> 06:30.406
You are.

06:33.478 --> 06:36.346
Listen, what happened last year
is in the past, okay?

06:36.414 --> 06:38.081
But nobody's gonna give me any this year

06:38.149 --> 06:41.184
because of the story I told about
tearing everyone's faces off.

06:41.253 --> 06:43.319
Anyone worried
their face will be torn off

06:43.388 --> 06:44.854
isn't a friend worth having.

06:46.992 --> 06:49.425
- I have three.
- I have five.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.227
I got four Candy-Grams!

06:51.296 --> 06:52.495
I got six!

06:58.904 --> 07:00.069
How'd it go with Anna-Kat?

07:00.138 --> 07:01.137
Funny story.

07:01.206 --> 07:03.706
Daddy said I get to stay home today!

07:04.976 --> 07:06.009
"The end."

07:06.077 --> 07:08.211
"Katie, if we interfere

07:08.280 --> 07:10.313
and don't let our kids
experience disappointment,

07:10.382 --> 07:11.514
they'll never learn."

07:11.583 --> 07:12.949
That's fair.

07:13.018 --> 07:15.018
Although, after 18 years,
I expect a better "Greg."

07:20.658 --> 07:23.260
Do you think Greg and I are crazy

07:23.299 --> 07:25.023
- for keeping her home?
- Of course not.

07:25.058 --> 07:27.125
We need to protect our kids
from life's hardships

07:27.194 --> 07:28.426
as long as we can.

07:28.495 --> 07:30.528
And that includes using bumpers
at the bowling alley,

07:30.597 --> 07:32.297
and I don't want to hear
another word about it.

07:32.366 --> 07:33.732
Everyone deserves a strike.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.368
I say the more hardships,
the better. It builds character.

07:36.436 --> 07:37.769
In fact, once a year,

07:37.838 --> 07:39.738
I like to purposely forget
one of my kids' birthdays.

07:39.806 --> 07:42.407
I know taking Anna-Kat back to school

07:42.476 --> 07:44.242
and letting her deal with this head-on

07:44.311 --> 07:46.044
is the right thing to do.

07:46.113 --> 07:47.779
I just don't have it in me.

07:47.848 --> 07:48.647
I do.

07:53.787 --> 07:55.353
Excuse me. Did you bring a late note?

07:57.424 --> 07:58.957
You're welcome.

07:59.026 --> 08:00.992
How was Anna-Kat? Was she okay?

08:01.061 --> 08:02.661
Don't know. Never looked back.

08:02.729 --> 08:05.497
Now, let's talk about something
that's actually interesting.

08:05.565 --> 08:06.631
What's going on between Taylor

08:06.700 --> 08:08.166
and that ding-a-ling boyfriend of hers?

08:08.235 --> 08:09.668
They're still going strong.

08:09.736 --> 08:12.270
As far as I can tell,
he has no redeeming qualities.

08:12.339 --> 08:14.239
Well, as long as she's happy...

08:19.046 --> 08:21.313
Can you imagine
if that's how we really felt?

08:23.984 --> 08:26.351
He drives me crazy.

08:26.420 --> 08:27.619
Well, maybe that's the point.

08:27.688 --> 08:29.187
Sounds like
Trip's the guy you bring home

08:29.256 --> 08:30.288
to piss off your parents.

08:30.357 --> 08:31.723
Oh, yeah. I dated one of those.

08:31.792 --> 08:34.359
He checked all the boxes...
van, neck tattoo,

08:34.428 --> 08:36.260
strong commitment to the sleeveless T.

08:36.330 --> 08:38.962
The more they hated him,
the more I liked him.

08:39.032 --> 08:40.298
Exactly.

08:40.366 --> 08:42.701
So if you want to get rid
of this Trip guy fast,

08:42.769 --> 08:44.034
you need to embrace him.

08:44.104 --> 08:45.403
Hmm.

08:45.472 --> 08:48.606
You know, mine also had a van,
neck tattoo, and no sleeves.

08:48.675 --> 08:50.041
Was yours Mark...

08:50.110 --> 08:51.142
- Anderson?
- McKenna?

08:51.211 --> 08:52.410
Holy crap, girl.

08:52.479 --> 08:54.913
We were this close
to being Bajingo Sisters.

08:59.252 --> 09:00.518
What do ya think?

09:00.587 --> 09:02.287
You look like a million bucks.

09:02.356 --> 09:03.355
Thanks, Spencer.

09:03.423 --> 09:04.689
That wasn't a compliment.

09:04.758 --> 09:06.825
Hence the comparison to chump change.

09:06.893 --> 09:08.326
What should I do? My date's in an hour.

09:08.395 --> 09:10.095
Don't worry. I got you covered.

09:11.531 --> 09:13.298
I planned every moment of your evening.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.999
A limo will pick you up and take you

09:15.068 --> 09:17.535
to my old favorite spot, Chez Royale.

09:17.604 --> 09:19.771
Wow. I don't know what to say.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.706
Well, it's the least I could do.

09:21.775 --> 09:24.309
You were there for me the moment
I got out of the big house.

09:25.412 --> 09:26.578
Just a minute.

09:26.646 --> 09:28.613
We need to deal
with your pale complexion.

09:28.682 --> 09:29.881
How?

09:29.950 --> 09:31.750
Well, you don't have time
to do it the natural way,

09:31.818 --> 09:33.752
so I've done some Yahoo-ing
on my cellphone,

09:33.820 --> 09:34.953
and I found...

09:35.021 --> 09:36.087
Dimitri!

09:39.559 --> 09:41.893
Paint him "Spencer Blitz Brown."

09:43.897 --> 09:45.964
You know what goes good
with anniversary tacos?

09:46.032 --> 09:47.465
Guacamole.

09:47.534 --> 09:49.267
- Say "salsa."
- Salsa.

09:49.336 --> 09:51.803
Salsa dancing, with Westport's
preeminent salsa instructor,

09:51.872 --> 09:53.238
Javier Gonzalez.

09:53.306 --> 09:55.507
Greg, for our 20th,
I promise you I'll consider that

09:55.575 --> 09:56.741
and then ultimately bail.

09:58.145 --> 09:59.244
Mama, Daddy, guess what!

09:59.312 --> 10:01.212
I got four Candy-Grams today!

10:01.281 --> 10:04.616
Honey! That's amazing!

10:04.684 --> 10:05.683
I told you it would work out.

10:05.752 --> 10:06.918
Do you know who gave them to you?

10:06.987 --> 10:08.420
No, but my guess is Skyler

10:08.488 --> 10:10.555
and three of the seven girls
named Madison.

10:10.624 --> 10:12.824
I'm going up to my room to open one.

10:12.893 --> 10:14.859
Hold on. Didn't you get a ride
home from Taylor and Trip?

10:14.928 --> 10:17.495
Yeah. She's watching him
do push-ups in the driveway.

10:21.902 --> 10:23.201
Whoo!

10:23.270 --> 10:26.004
69, 70, 71...

10:26.072 --> 10:27.739
Greg, it's time for

10:27.808 --> 10:30.175
Operation "Embrace
Our Daughter's Boyfriend

10:30.243 --> 10:32.911
So She Thinks We Like Him
And Stops Dating Him."

10:32.979 --> 10:34.979
I realize I need a better code name.

10:43.356 --> 10:44.656
This is a nice place, huh?

10:49.329 --> 10:51.763
Isn't it a little... old?

10:51.832 --> 10:54.399
Some might say "old."
Some might say "classy."

10:54.468 --> 10:55.600
I say "old."

10:57.070 --> 10:59.771
Sir, you have a phone call.

11:04.878 --> 11:05.944
Hello?

11:06.012 --> 11:07.779
Nothing tells a lady you're big-time

11:07.848 --> 11:10.014
like a giant phone
brought to your table.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.783
Sorry. I need to call you back.

11:11.852 --> 11:13.084
Pretending you're too important
to talk...

11:13.153 --> 11:14.719
well played!

11:14.788 --> 11:15.987
Now, remember the ice-breakers.

11:16.056 --> 11:17.922
What's her favorite movie,
favorite color,

11:17.991 --> 11:19.157
who's her favorite Bee Gee.

11:19.226 --> 11:20.258
Okay.

11:20.327 --> 11:21.659
And if she says "Maurice Gibb,"

11:21.728 --> 11:24.028
dump her immediately
'cause she is [Bleep] crazy.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.968
So... uh...

11:30.036 --> 11:31.269
what's your favorite movie?

11:31.338 --> 11:32.637
I don't know.

11:32.706 --> 11:33.872
When I was little,

11:33.940 --> 11:35.707
I watched "Tangled"
about a thousand times.

11:35.775 --> 11:37.876
Never seen it.

11:37.944 --> 11:39.377
But I was little once.

11:42.849 --> 11:44.382
Maybe we should order.

11:44.451 --> 11:46.150
They said the kitchen closes at 7:30.

11:46.219 --> 11:48.586
Oliver, this whole night
has been super weird.

11:48.655 --> 11:49.988
- Which part?
- All of it...

11:50.056 --> 11:52.323
this place,
the giant stretch white limo,

11:52.392 --> 11:53.658
your spray tan.

11:53.727 --> 11:55.960
Yeah, this guy Dimitri
wouldn't stop blasting me.

11:56.029 --> 12:00.064
Look, when you asked me out,
I was kind of excited, but...

12:00.133 --> 12:02.133
You know what? I'm just gonna go.

12:02.202 --> 12:03.801
At least let the driver take you home.

12:03.870 --> 12:05.403
It's okay.

12:05.472 --> 12:07.305
I'll just go to my parents' restaurant.

12:07.374 --> 12:09.307
I'm supposed to work there later anyway.

12:20.487 --> 12:21.819
Hello?

12:21.888 --> 12:23.254
Hate to interrupt. About my new phone...

12:23.323 --> 12:25.056
my wallpaper is a mountain.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.391
How do I make it a butterfly?

12:30.864 --> 12:32.163
This is my favorite food.

12:32.232 --> 12:35.199
That's why we got you
the jumbo pack of gummy worms.

12:35.268 --> 12:36.868
We always want you to feel welcome here.

12:38.171 --> 12:39.737
We are so glad
the two of you found each other.

12:39.806 --> 12:41.739
God is smiling on us.

12:41.808 --> 12:43.207
<i>Reel it in, Katie.</i>

12:43.276 --> 12:46.277
Taylor, why don't you get Trip
some more gummy worms?

12:52.218 --> 12:55.019
Why are Mom and Dad
suddenly being so nice to Trip?

12:55.088 --> 12:56.821
It's freaking me out.

12:56.890 --> 12:58.756
They're probably using
reverse psychology

12:58.825 --> 13:00.024
to make you less into him.

13:00.093 --> 13:01.292
Yeah, right.

13:01.361 --> 13:03.261
Trust me... I know
what I'm talking about.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.730
I'm 8 years old, and I've been
in therapy for four of them.

13:07.033 --> 13:08.666
I'll have you know, gummy worms
are my most favorite.

13:08.735 --> 13:09.601
She does love them.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.204
Fine.

13:13.273 --> 13:15.106
Mom and Dad want to play games?

13:15.175 --> 13:16.341
I'm game.

13:19.512 --> 13:21.879
Taylor, we were just telling Trip

13:21.948 --> 13:23.848
how much we are loving having him here.

13:23.917 --> 13:25.817
Great! Then maybe we should join you

13:25.885 --> 13:27.218
for your anniversary dinner tonight.

13:27.287 --> 13:28.686
Oh. Uh... no.

13:28.755 --> 13:30.755
I'm sure you two
have better things to do.

13:30.824 --> 13:32.824
Oh, we do, but we're just gonna
put them on hold

13:32.892 --> 13:35.793
because we're all enjoying
each other's company so much.

13:35.862 --> 13:36.928
They're making tacos.

13:36.997 --> 13:39.897
Tacooooooos!

13:39.966 --> 13:41.232
Just when I thought this anniversary

13:41.301 --> 13:42.600
couldn't get more special.

13:47.574 --> 13:49.007
Killer grub, Mr. A.

13:49.075 --> 13:50.975
I'm glad you like them, Trip.

13:51.044 --> 13:52.176
I'll get you some more.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.678
Katie, help?

13:54.948 --> 13:56.314
Sure, honey.

13:57.417 --> 13:58.883
I feel like my plan is backfiring.

13:58.952 --> 14:00.084
You think?

14:00.153 --> 14:01.719
The most romantic thing
to happen at the dinner

14:01.788 --> 14:03.287
was when me and Trip
accidentally touched hands

14:03.356 --> 14:04.555
when we went for more cheese.

14:04.624 --> 14:06.057
Ugh.

14:06.126 --> 14:07.692
I'm gonna go make some more room.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.327
Then I'm coming back for thirds.

14:09.396 --> 14:12.530
I do admire how he knows his system.

14:12.599 --> 14:14.499
I know what you two are up to.

14:14.567 --> 14:16.401
You're just trying to use...

14:17.504 --> 14:18.870
Anna-Kat, what's it called, again?

14:18.938 --> 14:20.071
Reverse psychology!

14:20.140 --> 14:21.739
...reverse psychology!

14:21.808 --> 14:23.141
Taylor, we both know

14:23.209 --> 14:25.443
that you're just dating him to annoy us.

14:25.512 --> 14:27.345
Has it occurred to you
that I might be dating him

14:27.414 --> 14:28.613
because I actually like him

14:28.682 --> 14:30.014
and it has nothing to do with you?

14:30.083 --> 14:32.483
You know I don't function that way.

14:32.552 --> 14:34.519
From now on, I'd appreciate it

14:34.587 --> 14:36.521
if you both stopped
butting into my life!

14:36.589 --> 14:38.256
Trip! We're leaving!

14:38.324 --> 14:39.824
But... thirds?

14:43.029 --> 14:44.595
Why are you home so early?

14:44.664 --> 14:46.631
And why does your skin look like
the inside of a peanut butter cup?

14:46.700 --> 14:47.999
I don't want to talk about it.

14:48.068 --> 14:49.267
Trip, let's go.

14:51.871 --> 14:53.104
Hello?

14:53.173 --> 14:54.405
Principal Ablin.

14:54.474 --> 14:56.708
No one goes anywhere.

14:56.776 --> 14:57.809
Okay.

14:59.446 --> 15:01.857
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:02.182 --> 15:03.214
Of course.

15:03.283 --> 15:04.949
We will deal with this immediately.

15:07.987 --> 15:10.088
Come on, Anna-Kat!

15:10.156 --> 15:11.689
- Yes!
- Yes!

15:11.758 --> 15:13.591
Please... Principal Ablin is a sad man

15:13.660 --> 15:15.093
who's jealous of my happiness.

15:15.161 --> 15:16.527
Wait for us upstairs.

15:16.596 --> 15:17.995
We're out of here.

15:18.064 --> 15:19.430
I'm going to my room.

15:22.060 --> 15:23.682
This is worse
than our ninth anniversary,

15:23.737 --> 15:25.658
when I released the doves
into the ceiling fan.

15:32.511 --> 15:33.722
Anna-Kat?

15:33.824 --> 15:35.223
Where'd she go?

15:36.226 --> 15:38.248
Are you in there?

15:38.273 --> 15:40.287
Come back later! I need some privacy!

15:40.311 --> 15:43.178
Privacy? Normally, she wants me
to hold her hand while she poops.

15:43.247 --> 15:44.580
- We're going in.
- Mm-hmm.

15:46.116 --> 15:48.566
What... are you doing?

15:49.519 --> 15:51.686
Getting rid of the evidence,
like the guy in "Fargo"

15:51.755 --> 15:53.488
when he put the body
in the wood chipper.

15:53.557 --> 15:54.889
You let her watch "Fargo"?

15:54.958 --> 15:56.858
You were supposed to
close your eyes for that part.

15:56.927 --> 15:59.961
Anna-Kat, the principal told us
why you have so many Candy-Grams.

16:00.030 --> 16:01.930
You've all angered Bloody Becky,

16:01.998 --> 16:03.464
but there's still a way to stop her

16:03.533 --> 16:05.600
from ripping out your eyeballs

16:05.669 --> 16:07.635
and eating them like Spanish olives.

16:07.704 --> 16:09.137
I love Spanish olives.

16:09.206 --> 16:11.306
This is not the time, Franklin.

16:11.374 --> 16:14.642
All Candy-Grams
must be thrown into a volcano.

16:14.711 --> 16:16.477
As it happens, I'm visiting one later.

16:19.549 --> 16:22.383
You told us that you were done
with Bloody Becky.

16:22.452 --> 16:24.452
I was worried I wasn't
gonna get any Candy-Grams,

16:24.521 --> 16:25.587
so I took action.

16:25.655 --> 16:26.854
I understand you were nervous,

16:26.923 --> 16:28.556
but you promised you wouldn't
tell any more stories,

16:28.625 --> 16:30.325
and then you lied to us
and did it anyway.

16:30.393 --> 16:31.492
For punishment, no electronics

16:31.561 --> 16:33.127
and no more secret movie night
with your mom.

16:33.196 --> 16:34.395
You heard your father.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.464
We finish watching
"The Shining," and that's it!

16:36.533 --> 16:37.532
Now go to your room.

16:40.203 --> 16:41.836
I need to use your makeup remover.

16:43.740 --> 16:45.173
So, Oliver, tell us about your date.

16:45.242 --> 16:46.708
It went amazing.

16:46.776 --> 16:49.510
That's why I got home at 6:00
and look like a preppy Cheeto.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.904
She'll never go out with me again.

16:52.749 --> 16:55.717
Okay. We interfered with Taylor,
and that didn't work out.

16:55.785 --> 16:57.983
We didn't interfere with Anna-Kat,
and that also didn't work out.

16:58.037 --> 17:00.455
- What's our move?
- Maybe we interfere with Oliver,

17:00.523 --> 17:03.630
but we just call it "getting involved."

17:04.426 --> 17:06.426
Oliver, you know, it's not
too late to win her back.

17:06.496 --> 17:09.230
Trust me... it is.
The date was a disaster.

17:09.299 --> 17:10.565
I don't know.

17:10.634 --> 17:14.469
Sounds like Gina needs
a big romantic gesture.

17:14.537 --> 17:18.106
Do you have any experience
with those, Greg?

17:18.174 --> 17:19.473
I've been known to dabble.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.843
What kind of stuff does Gina like?

17:21.911 --> 17:23.810
All I got was that
she liked the movie "Tangled."

17:23.880 --> 17:25.113
I can work with that.

17:26.282 --> 17:28.215
Man! This stuff isn't gonna cut it.

17:28.285 --> 17:31.152
I'm gonna need to use
that stuff drag queens use.

17:31.221 --> 17:32.453
Dimitri.

17:45.802 --> 17:47.402
We're almost done.
You should go get Gina.

17:47.470 --> 17:48.503
You think this is gonna work?

17:48.571 --> 17:50.138
If it'll make you feel more confident,

17:50.206 --> 17:52.774
we could always have an old dude
on standby with a giant phone.

17:52.842 --> 17:55.209
I shared that with you
because I felt safe.

17:58.615 --> 18:00.480
Taylor, you texted me
that you weren't coming

18:00.558 --> 18:02.250
and that you wanted
nothing to do with us.

18:02.469 --> 18:03.901
Well, Trip changed my mind.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.470
His exact words were,

18:05.538 --> 18:07.371
"There's nothing
more important than family.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.107
And family is really important
because it's family.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.810
And family is family.
And that's important."

18:14.914 --> 18:16.080
Well said, Trip.

18:17.851 --> 18:19.684
Hey, Anna-Kat. Let me
help you out with that.

18:24.657 --> 18:26.524
Maybe he does have
some redeeming qualities.

18:28.294 --> 18:29.627
Damn it.

18:43.977 --> 18:45.042
What are you doing here?

18:45.111 --> 18:47.778
Listen, I'm really sorry about tonight.

18:48.948 --> 18:50.648
Okay. I got to get back to work.

18:50.717 --> 18:51.849
Hold on.

18:51.918 --> 18:54.919
Before you go, I just want
to show you one thing.

19:05.298 --> 19:08.699
♪ It's all about you ♪
♪ It's about you ♪

19:08.768 --> 19:12.303
♪ It's all about you, baby ♪
♪ It's all about ♪

19:12.372 --> 19:15.806
♪ It's all about you ♪
♪ It's about you ♪

19:15.875 --> 19:17.909
♪ It's all about you ♪

19:17.977 --> 19:19.610
Oh, my God!

19:19.679 --> 19:22.346
It's like my favorite scene
from "Tangled"!
