WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.381
Load up! Now!

00:30.989 --> 00:33.992
Your Majesty, we found this man
riding through the woods.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.123
Sibeth?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.127
Kofun?

00:46.171 --> 00:47.506
Is that really you?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.426
What are you--
What are you doing here? What is this?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.095
Kneel for your queen, witch.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.638
She's not my queen.

00:57.933 --> 01:01.520
Poor Kofun.
Always and forever a step behind.

01:02.271 --> 01:06.859
Though in fairness, I must thank you
for freeing me from my sister's clutches.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.528
You're working with Trivantes.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.073
You're insane.
They're gonna destroy Pennsa.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.077
No, I'm going to destroy Pennsa.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.419
Kofun, don't make me wonder

01:25.502 --> 01:28.964
whether my fondness for you
might be a character flaw.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.259
You're gonna kill thousands.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.637
Maghra should've thought of that
before her little coup.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.184
Tormada, are we ready?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.186
We are, my queen.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.772
Sibeth, please don't do this.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.524
Do it.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.818
On my mark!

01:50.652 --> 01:52.905
Hold on, Kofun.
You won't want to miss this.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.073
Move him.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.032
Why are you troubling yourself
with the burial of traitors?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.786
There is no one else
to say the final prayers for them.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.885
I trained them.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.099
I fought with them.

03:08.605 --> 03:12.150
I never imagined this.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.238
They tried to kill us.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.413
They did what they believed was right.

03:29.042 --> 03:34.798
They've lived their entire life
in the service of an ideal.

03:37.009 --> 03:40.137
We were the ones to change the rules.

04:01.909 --> 04:02.910
Let's go.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.414
How go your preparations?

04:07.497 --> 04:11.376
It's somewhat difficult to prepare
for an enemy we don't know

04:11.460 --> 04:13.295
with weapons we don't understand.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.922
But the army is assembled.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.257
Did you believe what Shiloh said

04:18.341 --> 04:20.969
about Sibeth allying herself
with the Trivantians?

04:21.053 --> 04:24.681
Witchfinders don't lie.
And I put nothing past your sister.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.478
What use would the Trivantians have
for Sibeth or the Witchfinders?

04:30.020 --> 04:34.066
If Tormada is indeed leading
a rogue faction of the Trivantian army,

04:34.691 --> 04:37.277
their numbers might not be
as large as we fear.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.948
Which is why they might have welcomed
an alliance with her.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.451
The numbers won't matter if those bombs
can do what Baba said they can.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.183
Armed and ready, sir.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.147
As soon as we reach the palace,
I will order battalions out to the gates.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.275
We'll not allow those weapons
to enter the city.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.457
Fire!

05:34.918 --> 05:36.420
Fire!

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
What is it?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.123
-We're too late.
-No.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.131
Oh, my.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.808
Maghra!

06:33.852 --> 06:34.895
Maghra!

06:36.396 --> 06:37.397
Tamacti.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.943
They've breached the walls. Come.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.862
No, they didn't breach the walls.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.033
The bombs came over the walls.
I heard them fly.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.160
Wolffe.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.622
Again!

07:21.775 --> 07:24.611
Haniwa! Haniwa!

07:30.576 --> 07:32.327
Keep moving! Go!

07:47.593 --> 07:48.594
Maghra!

07:49.595 --> 07:51.430
-Maghra.
-Papa! We can't find her.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.307
-Keep moving. Okay?
-Okay.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.987
-Wolffe!
-Here!

08:11.200 --> 08:12.326
We have to move.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.119
-We'll be safer here.
-No. Come on.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.539
Fire!

08:36.350 --> 08:39.227
No! No! No!

10:31.798 --> 10:34.426
Hello? Who's there?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.805
Relax. You're safe.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.099
Where am I?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.393
You are on Alkenny land.

10:44.311 --> 10:48.857
Alkenny? One-- One of the hidden tribes?

10:50.526 --> 10:53.195
The way you say that
tells me you're not from a tribe.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.282
No.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.451
Where then?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.038
The Northern Mountains.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.083
You've come a long way.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.212
How did I get here?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.131
Don't you remember?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.803
There was a-- a woman.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.849
Yes. Paris.

11:22.975 --> 11:26.311
She found you wandering in the snow.
She brought you back to this village.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.731
She says you were running from something.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.945
She says maybe you haven't run far enough.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.163
Haniwa, what is it?

11:46.498 --> 11:49.543
The palace is destroyed. Papa.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.088
What do you hear?

11:53.172 --> 11:55.007
No. No!

12:01.930 --> 12:02.931
No.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.187
Maghra!

12:11.523 --> 12:13.483
Come, baby. Papa.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.902
Maghra.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.530
Ranger, help me!

12:24.661 --> 12:25.996
Baba Voss.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.290
Tamacti Jun. Ranger, help him.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.091
She's still breathing. Still breathing.
Maghra.

12:38.175 --> 12:41.178
Tormada, tell me you didn't disappoint.

12:42.221 --> 12:45.432
My Ayuras report all direct hits,
my queen.

12:49.811 --> 12:54.233
Kofun. What did you see? Huh?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.278
You bombed your own child.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.241
If he is in harm's way,
it's your mother who has placed him there,

13:02.324 --> 13:04.117
just as she's placed you here.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.120
Fuck you.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.331
Secure him inside my tent.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.590
-Load up!
-Wait, wait, wait.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.262
Let's give my sister some time
to appreciate the position she's in.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.973
The deaths she's caused.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.975
Are you sure?

13:28.058 --> 13:30.394
We've mapped the city,
established key coordinates.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.145
Don't worry.

13:32.855 --> 13:36.358
Knowing my sister,
you'll be launching more soon enough.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.221
I hear you…

14:10.184 --> 14:12.144
struggling against your ties.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.732
And I can't help but feel

14:18.025 --> 14:20.861
that that's what you've been doing
since I've known you,

14:22.196 --> 14:25.657
struggling against these invisible ties
that bind you.

14:27.618 --> 14:30.787
You cannot get free,
but you never stop trying.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.499
I think it's what I love most about you.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.338
You don't love me.
You don't know anything about love.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.340
On the contrary.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.718
If anything, I love too much, too deeply.

14:46.470 --> 14:50.599
That's why I allowed myself to believe
Maghra wouldn't betray me again.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.436
If you love me, you won't kill me.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.278
I'm the one who doesn't know
anything about love?

15:18.210 --> 15:19.294
Poor Kofun.

15:23.090 --> 15:27.344
A year ago, you were an Alkenny.
A simple mountain boy.

15:28.136 --> 15:33.600
And now, you bear witness
to the rise and fall of kingdoms.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.813
There's so much you do not understand.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.525
I understand that you're a murderer
and a traitor.

15:47.406 --> 15:50.993
And what makes me any different
than your mother?

15:55.998 --> 15:59.960
She rose up against the ordained queen.
Is she not a traitor?

16:01.003 --> 16:03.547
Last time I was in Pennsa,
she hosted an execution.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.174
Is she not a murderer?

16:07.050 --> 16:09.178
"Traitor," "murderer," they're just words.

16:10.596 --> 16:14.558
And their truth is dictated
by whichever side you happen to be on.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.186
-You're on the side of the Trivantians.
-No.

16:17.269 --> 16:20.063
I am on the side of God.

16:21.899 --> 16:25.569
How else do you explain
I'm still alive despite my death sentence,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.779
about to retake my throne?

16:29.072 --> 16:32.784
Your sightless child was sent to me by God

16:32.868 --> 16:36.163
to delay my execution
long enough to make my escape.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.999
He's your son too,
no matter how many times you deny it.

16:41.126 --> 16:45.047
He has served his holy purpose
and shall be remembered for it.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.592
You're a monster.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.056
And you are a witch.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.727
Perhaps your mother's short reign
may have tricked you

16:58.810 --> 17:00.479
into thinking otherwise.

17:02.564 --> 17:06.108
But there are a hundred Witchfinders
right outside this tent

17:06.193 --> 17:10.696
who will happily burn you alive
just to remind you who you are.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.034
I'm just trying to remind you who you are.

17:15.618 --> 17:16.828
And who is that?

17:18.329 --> 17:19.623
You're Wolffe's mother.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.377
And he needs you.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.384
You said he was brought here to save you.
Well, maybe he's not done doing that.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.304
He's your son.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.268
He's your son, Sibeth.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.277
He's your son.

17:59.288 --> 18:00.289
Please wake up.

18:01.665 --> 18:02.666
Maghra.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.298
Oh, please wake up, please wake up.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.008
What is your name?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.054
You won't tell me your name?

18:18.056 --> 18:19.433
I don't want to lie to you.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.771
Are you the leader of the Alkenny?

18:26.064 --> 18:27.065
Yes.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.277
But you're not from here.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.823
I don't know your accent,
but it's not from the mountains.

18:34.907 --> 18:37.117
-Are you being pursued?
-No.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.411
You said you didn't wanna lie.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.460
I was being pursued,
but I've been traveling for a long time,

18:46.543 --> 18:47.753
and I left no trail.

18:48.754 --> 18:49.755
You can't know that.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.090
No, I can't.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.137
Rest up.
You will leave as soon as you can walk.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.098
That might take a bit longer
than you think.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.434
Why is that?

19:03.560 --> 19:04.686
I'm with child.

19:08.774 --> 19:10.025
She's waking up.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.819
Maghra. Maghra.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.114
Baba.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.160
I am here with Haniwa.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.540
I'm so glad you're back.

19:24.623 --> 19:25.916
I was so worried.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.962
The house just-- just flew apart.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.383
I know. It's the God Thunder. The bombs.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.844
You were not able to stop them?

19:37.845 --> 19:38.846
No.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.098
Wolffe!

19:41.181 --> 19:44.017
It's okay. It's okay.
He is safe. You saved him.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.940
Where's Kofun? Why is he not here?

19:51.108 --> 19:52.484
We sent him ahead to warn you.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.278
No, he's not been here.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.989
-Where is he? He could be hurt.
-We will find him.

19:57.573 --> 19:59.074
It's all my fault.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.788
Mama. Don't be ridiculous.

20:04.872 --> 20:07.708
No, you did your best
to make peace with Trivantes.

20:09.585 --> 20:13.046
No, it's not Trivantes.
It's Sibeth.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.757
How could that even be?

20:15.841 --> 20:17.759
Sibeth made an alliance

20:17.843 --> 20:20.679
between the rebel Witchfinders
and Tormada's army.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.473
I shielded her from execution.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.435
I let the Witchfinders live.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.647
I created the army
that will now destroy us.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.943
I need to go outside.

20:37.988 --> 20:41.366
Wait, wait. Mama. Mama.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.911
Haniwa, what do you see?

20:44.411 --> 20:49.208
The huts are on fire.
There are dead and wounded everywhere.

20:51.502 --> 20:56.632
People are just wandering around…

20:59.134 --> 21:00.636
and they look terrified.

21:01.220 --> 21:05.891
Of course they're terrified.
Fire is falling from the sky like rain.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.894
There's no more fire falling from the sky.

21:08.977 --> 21:09.978
For now.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.899
Sibeth is letting us know
she's in control.

21:15.150 --> 21:19.029
Tamacti, assemble the Royal Guard
to put out the fires,

21:19.112 --> 21:20.948
and gather and treat the wounded.

21:21.031 --> 21:24.493
Evacuate those who can move quickly
to Altoona

21:24.576 --> 21:27.955
where we will regroup
and be ready to fight.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.752
We must find your brother.

21:33.836 --> 21:37.881
We found Mama and Wolffe.
We'll find Kofun.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.051
Come, Mama.

21:51.395 --> 21:56.859
Kofun! I'm sorry we haven't been
properly introduced until now.

21:58.902 --> 22:02.447
It's been a busy time,
as I'm sure you know.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.534
I know who you are.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.871
Yes, I'm sure you do.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.041
And I just wanna say,

22:14.042 --> 22:19.381
that as dire as things may feel now,
you do still have options.

22:20.841 --> 22:21.925
Options?

22:23.343 --> 22:27.264
Your gifts have not always
been properly appreciated.

22:30.184 --> 22:33.896
Well, the--
the Payans think you're a witch,

22:34.730 --> 22:38.442
Trivantians think you're a threat
to the republic, and-- and me…

22:40.694 --> 22:41.945
I admire you.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.032
I understand your potential.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.619
If you were to join me--

22:48.702 --> 22:50.245
You tried to kill us.

22:50.329 --> 22:54.082
Well, yes, but that was before.
Things have changed.

22:54.666 --> 22:58.921
Certainly, I had no idea
I'd be allied with Queen Kane.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.758
She'll kill you when she's done with you.

23:02.841 --> 23:04.009
Exactly.

23:04.593 --> 23:08.180
Or maybe I will kill her.
Or maybe nobody will kill anybody.

23:10.224 --> 23:14.770
Every day is a new day, Kofun.
Today could be a new day for you.

23:14.853 --> 23:15.938
Fuck you.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.731
Yes, of course.

23:19.191 --> 23:22.402
Boys your age
always seem to think they know so much,

23:22.486 --> 23:25.656
when really, they're just too stupid
to realize what they don't know.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.324
I know my father will kill you.

23:27.991 --> 23:31.703
Like I said. Stupid.
We'll have plenty of time to educate you.

23:31.787 --> 23:32.788
What is it?

23:33.789 --> 23:35.707
The queen has sent for him.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.459
What for?

23:39.545 --> 23:41.046
Ask her yourself.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.460
Their camp's
about 100 heartbeats due east.

24:21.670 --> 24:22.838
How many soldiers?

24:25.716 --> 24:27.759
I can see about 50 or so.

24:31.013 --> 24:32.264
Where are the rest?

24:38.937 --> 24:40.022
Hush.

24:42.107 --> 24:44.109
There's no way out of the city.

24:44.193 --> 24:45.694
Will they invade?

24:45.777 --> 24:46.778
I don't think so.

24:47.821 --> 24:51.617
If they can continue to launch bombs,
why risk soldiers?

24:52.284 --> 24:55.871
Sibeth wants her city back.
Why would she destroy it?

24:56.371 --> 24:58.415
She could've launched many more,

24:59.249 --> 25:02.920
but the fact that we're still standing
means she wants the city whole.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.757
To do that,
she would have to send in her army.

25:09.718 --> 25:12.679
If Harlan and Trovere
were able to make their case in Trivantes,

25:12.763 --> 25:15.349
they could be on their way back now
with reinforcements.

25:15.933 --> 25:18.852
Mama. Harlan is dead.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.318
He died to save me.

25:34.409 --> 25:35.410
Mama--

25:36.578 --> 25:40.749
He, wanted me
to give something to you.

25:47.631 --> 25:48.632
A key?

25:50.634 --> 25:51.635
What's it for?

25:52.344 --> 25:55.180
I don't know. He said it might help.

26:10.821 --> 26:12.155
Haniwa?

26:12.948 --> 26:14.283
Kofun.

26:14.366 --> 26:15.367
Kofun?

26:16.410 --> 26:18.287
-You okay?
-Are you okay?

26:18.370 --> 26:20.163
Yeah. Papa.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.041
Where have you been?

26:23.125 --> 26:26.086
Sibeth.
She captured me just outside the city.

26:30.883 --> 26:32.259
She sent a message.

26:32.342 --> 26:33.760
A message?

26:33.844 --> 26:35.053
Yeah, she tied it.

26:39.141 --> 26:42.186
She wants your abdication
and total surrender.

26:44.563 --> 26:46.440
You'll walk alone to her camp,

26:47.107 --> 26:50.903
where you will forfeit your crown
and kingdom to her.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.281
She says if you don't go soon,

26:54.364 --> 26:58.994
then she'll turn Pennsa
and everyone in it into ash.

27:11.757 --> 27:16.345
She doesn't just want her kingdom back.
She wants to punish me.

27:17.471 --> 27:20.182
-You can't go.
-We're not having this argument, Haniwa.

27:20.265 --> 27:21.850
-Of course I'm going.
-She'll kill you.

27:21.934 --> 27:25.229
She'll kill all of us
and so many more if I don't go.

27:27.564 --> 27:31.276
She is my sister,
and as much as I despised her,

27:32.277 --> 27:34.780
when the moment came,
I found myself unable to kill her.

27:34.863 --> 27:37.449
Maybe she'll have the same hesitation
about killing me.

27:37.533 --> 27:39.034
You don't believe that.

27:39.117 --> 27:42.538
Ju-- It doesn't matter.
I-I have to go. I can't let her just…

27:43.664 --> 27:45.165
-Maghra!
-Mama!

27:50.629 --> 27:52.256
Paris says you will not eat.

27:52.965 --> 27:56.718
Why am I not allowed to leave this cave?
Am I your prisoner?

27:58.262 --> 28:01.348
The villagers--
They are suspicious of strangers.

28:02.266 --> 28:04.434
It is not safe for you to be out there.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.770
Well, if they don't want me here,
then I'll leave.

28:07.396 --> 28:08.772
And where will you go?

28:13.068 --> 28:15.529
You haven't even told me
your name or where you're from.

28:17.030 --> 28:20.117
If you want us to trust you,
you must trust us.

28:21.743 --> 28:22.870
You can trust me.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.081
Why would I trust you?

28:26.957 --> 28:28.917
Well,
I'm the one who's been protecting you.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.213
It's Maghra.

28:34.715 --> 28:37.718
-What?
-My name is Maghra.

28:38.886 --> 28:42.014
Maghra? What kinda name is Maghra?

28:43.015 --> 28:45.392
What kind of a name is Baba?

28:46.977 --> 28:48.228
That's a fair point, Maghra.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.610
Why are you the one protecting me?

28:56.778 --> 28:59.281
Because I was once in the same position
that you are in.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.492
And how did you get the villagers
to trust you?

29:03.952 --> 29:05.537
I defeated their strongest warrior.

29:07.456 --> 29:09.208
So, I guess I have to defeat you.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.253
Yes.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.805
Mama?

29:27.392 --> 29:28.393
Are you okay?

29:29.645 --> 29:30.896
Maghra.

29:33.023 --> 29:34.358
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:35.442 --> 29:36.652
We're all here.

29:45.911 --> 29:47.913
I have-- I have to go.

29:47.996 --> 29:50.874
No, no, no. We can't let you go.

29:53.544 --> 29:57.089
She will kill you where you stand,
and nothing will be gained.

29:58.966 --> 30:00.384
And what about Pennsa?

30:00.968 --> 30:03.470
She'll burn the entire city
just to spite me.

30:03.554 --> 30:04.763
I c-can't let that happen.

30:04.847 --> 30:08.225
If she's going to destroy Pennsa,
she will whether you are alive or dead.

30:08.308 --> 30:09.935
Is there no other way
to evacuate the city?

30:10.018 --> 30:13.021
-They have battalions at all the gates.
-So we fight our way out.

30:13.105 --> 30:15.649
The moment they hear resistance,
the bombs will come.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.985
The bombs will be coming either way,

30:18.652 --> 30:20.988
but this family will not be here
when they do.

30:22.406 --> 30:23.407
Harlan.

30:24.741 --> 30:25.868
What's that?

30:29.079 --> 30:31.456
He was always
three steps ahead of everyone.

30:32.708 --> 30:35.002
He was such an infuriating man.

30:36.587 --> 30:40.966
He gave me no reason to trust him.
Somehow, I did.

30:41.592 --> 30:45.554
Well, he could have saved himself,
but he came back for me.

30:52.936 --> 30:53.937
Maybe here?

31:01.361 --> 31:02.988
-No?
-No.

31:09.244 --> 31:10.537
He was in love with you.

31:24.301 --> 31:25.302
I used him.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.097
Now he's dead.

31:33.101 --> 31:37.105
Harlan didn't strike me as someone
who could be used if he didn't want to be.

31:50.369 --> 31:51.453
What is it?

31:54.665 --> 31:56.291
-Mama.
-Can you bring it?

32:05.926 --> 32:07.052
A sound wand?

32:08.595 --> 32:09.805
What else is in the box?

32:12.599 --> 32:13.684
Just this old map.

32:23.235 --> 32:24.486
It looks like Pennsa.

32:25.404 --> 32:27.823
It is Pennsa, but…

32:29.950 --> 32:31.410
something else, too.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.705
Oh, Harlan.

32:35.789 --> 32:38.166
Oh, you sneaky bastard.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.793
What is it?

32:40.711 --> 32:44.131
Tunnels. Smuggler's tunnels.

32:45.132 --> 32:46.508
Where do they go?

32:47.801 --> 32:50.345
Out of the city. Come on.

33:04.109 --> 33:05.569
My queen.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.614
Tormada. Come sit with me.

33:21.668 --> 33:24.838
How go your machinations?

33:26.757 --> 33:29.843
By now,
our message will have been delivered.

33:32.179 --> 33:33.722
I have every confidence

33:33.805 --> 33:36.433
my sister will arrive shortly
to surrender.

33:37.601 --> 33:41.939
And when she does,
all of Paya will be ours.

33:42.022 --> 33:45.526
I think reducing Pennsa to rubble
sends a more dramatic message.

33:46.652 --> 33:50.697
I haven't endured all that I have
to rule over rubble and corpses.

33:52.157 --> 33:54.952
Paya will fall in line
with Maghra's surrender.

33:55.744 --> 33:57.913
It's not Paya I'm speaking of.

33:59.957 --> 34:00.958
Trivantes.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.418
Don't underestimate their might.

34:04.169 --> 34:05.671
Don't underestimate ours.

34:07.506 --> 34:08.882
Believe me, I don't.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.885
I do have one request.

34:13.804 --> 34:16.139
-Your nephew.
-Kofun?

34:17.306 --> 34:19.893
I wish you had asked me
before you released him.

34:21.311 --> 34:23.397
Having lost
the rest of Jerlamarel's children,

34:23.480 --> 34:27.025
he would have been invaluable to me.

34:31.154 --> 34:34.241
You do realize that my arrangement
with the Witchfinders

34:34.324 --> 34:37.327
is based on an agreement
that all sighted are witches

34:37.411 --> 34:38.786
and must be burned?

34:38.871 --> 34:40.414
I won't need them forever.

34:41.581 --> 34:47.254
I have been working on adapting the system
to no longer require their sight.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.466
Until then, though,

34:51.550 --> 34:55.387
the Witchfinders will just need to agree
to certain exceptions.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.057
-The Witchfinders can be dangerous.
-So can I.

35:00.809 --> 35:03.103
They have God on their side.

35:04.021 --> 35:08.775
I hope you don't take offense,
but I don't believe in God.

35:09.860 --> 35:10.861
You don't?

35:20.412 --> 35:22.998
Maybe you haven't met the right one yet.

35:33.342 --> 35:36.178
-Are you interpreting that right?
-Yes.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.013
All the landmarks are accounted for.

35:38.597 --> 35:39.598
Let me see it.

35:47.356 --> 35:48.357
This way.

36:45.205 --> 36:47.541
Well, according to the map,
it should be right here.

36:54.047 --> 36:55.048
I don't see anything.

36:56.717 --> 36:58.010
Well, maybe the map's wrong.

36:59.386 --> 37:00.804
You didn't know Harlan.

37:02.806 --> 37:04.349
The map isn't wrong.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.607
Hello?

37:18.530 --> 37:19.656
There's nothing here.

37:57.236 --> 37:58.237
I'll be right back.

38:36.358 --> 38:37.943
We followed the tunnel to its end.

38:38.777 --> 38:41.238
It comes out in a small cave
in the mountains.

38:41.321 --> 38:42.531
Just west of Pennsa.

38:43.156 --> 38:46.702
If we move now, we can be halfway
to Altoona before they know we're gone.

38:46.785 --> 38:49.121
And what stops them
from bringing bombs to Altoona?

38:49.204 --> 38:51.290
Sibeth's army is still small.

38:51.373 --> 38:54.626
We can regroup in Altoona.
Gather soldiers.

38:54.710 --> 38:57.838
Be ready before they--
they can establish position

38:57.921 --> 38:58.922
as they did here.

39:00.340 --> 39:01.675
We've no time to lose.

39:02.801 --> 39:07.431
Captain Gosset, have your men begin
rounding up the citizens immediately.

39:08.473 --> 39:10.267
No one takes more than they can carry.

39:10.767 --> 39:14.730
Haniwa, you and Wren direct the captain
to the entrance you found.

39:20.736 --> 39:24.323
Kofun, Tamacti, Ranger.

39:25.866 --> 39:27.242
Leave us for a moment.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.006
Baba.

39:44.468 --> 39:45.761
You haven't said a word.

39:47.930 --> 39:52.100
You are queen.
You know what's best for your people.

39:54.728 --> 39:57.022
Yes, I must take care of the kingdom.

39:57.105 --> 40:01.652
But you are my husband.
And the father to Haniwa and Kofun.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.656
So you must decide what is best for us.

40:09.243 --> 40:10.369
I don't understand.

40:11.995 --> 40:14.581
My sister hunted us for 17 years.

40:16.208 --> 40:19.294
She didn't stop then,
and she won't stop now.

40:20.712 --> 40:22.548
She will never stop hunting this family.

40:27.886 --> 40:29.263
So what are you saying?

40:31.139 --> 40:35.644
I'm saying that you were right all along.

40:37.938 --> 40:40.315
Once we lead the people out of Pennsa,

40:40.399 --> 40:45.404
you and I, and Kofun, and Wolffe
and Haniwa, we shall go far away.

40:46.071 --> 40:48.532
Back up into the mountains,
or further even,

40:49.074 --> 40:51.451
where we can be the family we once were.

40:54.162 --> 40:55.163
Maybe with me gone,

40:55.247 --> 40:58.876
my sister will be less inclined
to direct her wrath at the Payans.

41:03.088 --> 41:04.089
Are you sure?

41:07.384 --> 41:10.679
I have been a mother much longer
than I've been a queen.

41:12.097 --> 41:16.059
And if my family coming first
means I'm a bad queen…

41:18.520 --> 41:22.649
well, then it just proves
that I-- I shouldn't be one.

41:25.736 --> 41:27.070
I don't feel anything.

41:27.988 --> 41:30.073
-Here.
-You mean here?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.242
Oh, there it is.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.872
-Here. Do you feel that?
-Where? Oh, here.

41:36.955 --> 41:39.625
No. Still nothing.

41:41.335 --> 41:44.880
I think you just like having an excuse
to put your hands on me.

41:44.963 --> 41:48.759
-I think maybe you like my hands on you.
-Well, maybe I do.

41:54.806 --> 41:56.058
You still feel nothing?

41:58.393 --> 41:59.561
Maybe it's scared of me.

42:01.855 --> 42:04.191
Maybe it's not the baby who's scared.

42:05.651 --> 42:08.529
What are you talking about?
Why would I be scared?

42:10.155 --> 42:11.865
Because you've never had a child.

42:15.369 --> 42:17.913
And this child, would it be mine?

42:24.837 --> 42:26.338
Do you want it to be yours?

42:30.259 --> 42:31.635
As much as I want you.

42:34.638 --> 42:36.473
Then we are both yours.

42:43.939 --> 42:44.982
I love you.

42:49.987 --> 42:53.198
I love you, Baba Voss.

42:55.617 --> 42:57.119
I love you, Maghra Voss.

43:01.206 --> 43:03.083
You think it will always be like this?

43:04.668 --> 43:05.878
You fear it will not?

43:07.129 --> 43:08.380
I fear for my child.

43:14.136 --> 43:15.846
I swear to you that I will die

43:15.929 --> 43:18.348
before I allow anything to happen
to you or our child.

43:20.601 --> 43:22.060
And we will protect you.

43:22.978 --> 43:23.979
Yes.

43:25.147 --> 43:27.566
-Yes, you protect me. I need that.
-Yes.

43:27.649 --> 43:29.193
-Oh, wait.
-What?

43:29.276 --> 43:30.736
You feel that?

43:30.819 --> 43:32.362
-There it is.
-Yeah?

43:32.446 --> 43:34.823
-It's kicking. And again.
-Yeah.

43:35.824 --> 43:38.827
-Oh, it's a very angry baby.
-Oh, wow.

43:38.911 --> 43:40.579
And he has a temper like his mother.

43:41.288 --> 43:44.208
A temper? I don't have a temper.
What are you talking about?

43:44.291 --> 43:47.336
-No, of course you don't.
-I don't have a temper. What do you mean?

43:48.212 --> 43:49.630
That's rich coming from you.

43:49.713 --> 43:52.841
-Look at that. Sassy baby.
-Sassy ba--

43:52.925 --> 43:55.135
Sassy, angry baby like your mother.

44:12.236 --> 44:13.987
Your dog stinks.

44:14.571 --> 44:16.031
Up.

44:17.533 --> 44:18.909
No, that's me.

44:18.992 --> 44:20.118
Up, boy.

44:21.620 --> 44:23.163
You should go home, my friend.

44:24.581 --> 44:27.793
My home was blown up, thanks to you.

44:28.669 --> 44:31.547
-You know what I mean.
-You know what I mean.

44:36.718 --> 44:40.264
I've avoided humanity for almost 20 years.

44:42.683 --> 44:44.226
And if I live through this,

44:44.309 --> 44:47.354
the day will soon come
where I will avoid them for another 20.

44:48.772 --> 44:50.148
But today is not that day.

44:51.650 --> 44:52.651
Damn it, Ranger.

44:53.569 --> 44:54.945
If anything happens to you,

44:55.028 --> 44:57.406
Lu will hunt me down
and kill me in my sleep.

44:58.240 --> 45:02.828
No. She will wake you first,
so that you feel it when it happens.

45:06.248 --> 45:08.876
I made the choice to leave the mountain.

45:09.668 --> 45:12.296
That may turn out
to have been a terrible mistake,

45:13.088 --> 45:16.675
but, as of this moment, my blade is sharp.

45:16.758 --> 45:19.928
My weed is good,
and the sun feels warm on my face.

45:20.012 --> 45:23.056
So, things being what they are,

45:24.308 --> 45:27.227
I think I will stay
and find out how the story ends.

45:29.897 --> 45:30.939
What do you think?

45:32.858 --> 45:34.902
I think you smoke too much of that herb.

45:36.403 --> 45:38.488
-Yeah, maybe.
-Too much.

45:41.241 --> 45:43.118
Or maybe you don't smoke enough.

46:23.534 --> 46:25.619
We have rounded up every citizen.

46:25.702 --> 46:27.621
Those not yet here are on their way.

46:28.372 --> 46:29.665
I hear unrest in your voice.

46:33.126 --> 46:37.673
Have you ever wondered
why we eat bison and deer, but not bear?

46:39.925 --> 46:42.386
When you hunt bison and deer,
they run away,

46:42.469 --> 46:44.304
and that makes them vulnerable.

46:45.055 --> 46:48.433
If you hunt a bear,
the bear hunts you back.

46:49.643 --> 46:52.771
As a general rule, those who flee
are the ones that get eaten.

46:53.438 --> 46:56.066
You agreed,
we stand a better chance in Altoona?

46:56.149 --> 47:00.070
Yes,
but first we have to make it to Altoona.

47:02.614 --> 47:04.157
Mom, I'm so sorry.

47:04.241 --> 47:06.159
-I'm so-- This is my fault.
-Kofun. Kofun.

47:06.243 --> 47:09.454
-It's my fault. I let her go.
-I let her live.

47:09.538 --> 47:12.791
Hey, hey, my loves. Listen to me.

47:12.875 --> 47:14.209
Haniwa.

47:15.711 --> 47:19.756
You are not just my family.
You are the best that I have ever known.

47:21.717 --> 47:24.636
I have been carrying blame on my shoulders

47:25.846 --> 47:30.642
for the Alkenny, for Edo,
for everything that came before.

47:32.895 --> 47:36.106
And I have been learning
from my occasionally wise friend, Ranger,

47:36.190 --> 47:39.526
that blaming yourself
does no one any good.

47:40.986 --> 47:43.614
You must pay attention to what lies ahead,
not behind.

47:45.157 --> 47:46.783
-Yes.
-Is that what you would do?

47:49.286 --> 47:50.954
It's what a wiser man would do.

47:59.796 --> 48:02.341
Come, my loves. Let's get out of here.

48:07.554 --> 48:08.805
Mama.

48:08.889 --> 48:09.890
This way.

49:05.737 --> 49:08.031
Come on, baby. No, no.

49:09.241 --> 49:11.618
-We have to keep moving.
-I want to go home.

49:11.702 --> 49:14.371
We can't go home. We have to keep moving.

49:14.454 --> 49:17.416
-No, I don't want to.
-Bella, please.

49:18.292 --> 49:22.880
Excuse me. Is your name Bella?

49:22.963 --> 49:25.299
-Yes.
-Oh, that's a beautiful name.

49:26.800 --> 49:27.968
My name is Maghra.

49:28.886 --> 49:29.887
My queen.

49:31.013 --> 49:33.765
-Are you scared, Bella?
-Yes.

49:33.849 --> 49:35.392
I'm scared too.

49:36.643 --> 49:39.313
But you know,
I have something that helps me.

49:43.358 --> 49:44.359
Feel.

49:45.861 --> 49:47.821
It is a sound wand.

49:48.405 --> 49:50.908
And, you know,
it's not just any sound wand.

49:50.991 --> 49:53.619
It is the queen's sound wand.

49:55.037 --> 49:56.038
Now listen.

50:01.126 --> 50:06.256
You know, I've been trying to find someone
who can hold it for me and keep it safe.

50:06.340 --> 50:08.550
-You think you could do that?
-Yes.

50:08.634 --> 50:09.927
Good.

50:11.970 --> 50:15.057
You bring it through the tunnel for me.

50:15.641 --> 50:19.144
And if you get scared,
you just hit it against the wall,

50:20.354 --> 50:21.939
and you listen to the sound.

50:22.689 --> 50:25.943
And you remember
that you are an emissary of the queen.

50:26.860 --> 50:27.861
All right?

50:29.863 --> 50:31.448
Now, go on, brave girl.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.413
-Maghra.
-Yes.

50:39.039 --> 50:40.040
My love.

50:43.669 --> 50:45.671
You are a true queen, my love.

50:48.966 --> 50:52.636
To your people. And to me.

50:58.892 --> 50:59.893
Come on.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.545
At this rate,
we'll be underground for another day.

51:27.379 --> 51:29.715
We go as slow as our slowest citizen.

51:30.883 --> 51:33.552
Baba Voss, why don't you take up the rear?

51:35.762 --> 51:36.763
Baba!

51:38.056 --> 51:39.057
Baba?

51:40.267 --> 51:42.769
-Where is he?
-He was just here a moment ago.

51:44.688 --> 51:45.689
Stop!

51:47.441 --> 51:48.442
Haniwa!

51:52.404 --> 51:53.405
Baba?

51:54.406 --> 51:56.033
-Where is he?
-Baba?

51:57.034 --> 51:58.035
I don't know.

51:59.578 --> 52:00.579
Dad!

52:00.662 --> 52:03.498
Perhaps he's gone back
to help the stragglers.

52:03.582 --> 52:05.542
-I'll send some scouts to find him.
-No.

52:06.793 --> 52:08.045
He won't be there.

52:08.629 --> 52:10.547
What do you mean? What did he tell you?

52:10.631 --> 52:13.300
He told me nothing
because he knows I would've stopped him.

52:14.092 --> 52:16.887
I know your father
better than I know myself, and so do you.

52:17.513 --> 52:18.931
He's gone back.

52:19.014 --> 52:21.725
-What?
-Why would he do that?

52:21.808 --> 52:24.144
He can't defeat an entire army by himself.

52:26.855 --> 52:28.315
He's gone to kill my sister.

53:15.237 --> 53:16.864
You really do smoke too much.

53:18.574 --> 53:19.575
No such thing.

53:25.789 --> 53:26.790
Where are you headed?

53:29.084 --> 53:31.753
I'm gonna hunt down that demon queen
and cut out her heart.

53:31.837 --> 53:34.089
Sounds like a terrible idea.

53:34.173 --> 53:35.382
Can I come?

53:35.465 --> 53:36.466
Sure.

53:37.676 --> 53:39.303
Beware of wolves, Baba Voss.

53:40.512 --> 53:41.763
We are the fucking wolves.

53:42.306 --> 53:43.307
All right.
