00:00.906 --> 00:03.687
<i>Ah, Christmas 1972.</i>

00:03.750 --> 00:06.031
<i>It was a simpler time when everyone,</i>

00:06.102 --> 00:08.570
<i>even aspiring left coast
showbiz elites like me,</i>

00:08.640 --> 00:10.171
<i>had no choice but to say...</i>

00:10.273 --> 00:12.274
Merry Christmas!

00:12.361 --> 00:13.927
Have at it, fellas.

00:14.009 --> 00:15.174
Careful with the wrapping!

00:15.276 --> 00:17.121
Smooth it out for the "next year" pile.

00:17.215 --> 00:19.879
<i>But most of all, Christmas
let us forget our differences</i>

00:19.981 --> 00:22.415
<i>and focus on
what really mattered... stuff.</i>

00:22.517 --> 00:25.518
Yes! The Adidas I wanted!

00:25.620 --> 00:27.587
Wait.

00:27.689 --> 00:30.923
- These are Adoodas.
- Look who suddenly cares about spelling.

00:31.026 --> 00:32.436
- Socks.
- Pass that around.

00:32.527 --> 00:33.793
That pack's for everybody.

00:33.895 --> 00:35.728
This will cover my whole leg!

00:35.830 --> 00:37.864
You think I've time to sort
laundry by different sizes?

00:37.966 --> 00:39.198
Roll it down or grow nine inches.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.734
This is just my old Lone Ranger
covered in tinfoil.

00:41.836 --> 00:45.104
Which makes him Space Ranger.
On Space Trigger.

00:45.206 --> 00:47.774
<i>Each kid generally got one
decent store-brought item.</i>

00:47.876 --> 00:49.642
<i>And then a wildcard gift
based on Mom's whim</i>

00:49.744 --> 00:51.811
<i>and her current supply
of glitter and pipe-cleaners.</i>

00:51.913 --> 00:54.113
Yay. So stoked to add this

00:54.215 --> 00:56.416
to my growing collection of God's eyes.

00:56.518 --> 00:57.817
Don't be ingrates.

00:57.919 --> 00:59.952
These gifts are practical
and/or from the heart.

01:00.055 --> 01:01.220
Thanks, Frank.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.422
Enjoy an extra pair of socks.

01:02.524 --> 01:03.890
Score.

01:03.992 --> 01:05.425
You guys never want to be
disappointed again?

01:05.527 --> 01:07.627
Stop buying into the emptiness
of materialism.

01:07.729 --> 01:09.562
- These are just things.
- Crappy things.

01:09.664 --> 01:11.330
They just had an earthquake
in Nicaragua, man.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.832
If you consider their suffering,

01:12.934 --> 01:14.333
I'll bet those sneakers
you're complaining about

01:14.436 --> 01:16.969
- will seem awfully small.
- They <i> are</i> small.

01:17.072 --> 01:18.531
Dad bought the wrong size Adoodas.

01:18.586 --> 01:19.705
What size are they?

01:19.808 --> 01:21.298
- "Extra medium."
- All right.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.743
Santa left one more gift in the garage.

01:23.845 --> 01:25.812
Follow me.

01:25.914 --> 01:27.080
A saw?

01:27.182 --> 01:29.282
I guess this one's for Baby Andy.

01:29.384 --> 01:31.084
It's all yours, Mr. Cleary.

01:31.186 --> 01:32.819
I can finally fix
the railing on the porch

01:32.921 --> 01:34.687
and the rest of the porch

01:34.789 --> 01:36.322
and the house.

01:36.424 --> 01:38.458
Maybe I can use it to cut my
socks down to the right size.

01:40.962 --> 01:42.295
At least Uncle Tom's
still coming by today.

01:42.397 --> 01:44.430
Oh, yeah! His gifts always kick Santa's

01:44.532 --> 01:45.631
right in his big, red sack.

01:45.733 --> 01:47.100
Because of my slick new saw,

01:47.202 --> 01:48.768
there's no room in the garage

01:48.870 --> 01:50.470
for whatever slick new car

01:50.572 --> 01:51.737
your brother's driving this year.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.373
Oh, honey. Stop trying
to turn everything

01:54.476 --> 01:56.375
into some competition with Tom.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.561
Because you can't win.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.413
He's got more money,
which makes him better.

01:59.414 --> 02:00.646
If I was single with no kids,

02:00.748 --> 02:02.048
I'd be swimming in bachelor dough, too,

02:02.150 --> 02:03.449
except I wouldn't be flaunting it around

02:03.551 --> 02:05.284
- like some downtown fancy-man.
- Mm.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.386
Ooh, but I got him this time.

02:07.489 --> 02:09.020
Thanks to Becky.

02:09.124 --> 02:11.457
- Did you name your saw Becky?
- Don't be jealous, Peg.

02:12.827 --> 02:14.627
I'd hate to have
to choose between you two.

02:17.432 --> 02:18.998
- Merry Christmas!
- Hey,

02:19.100 --> 02:20.733
I thought you were
gonna be at your grandma's?

02:20.835 --> 02:22.768
On my way, but I wanted
to drop off your gift.

02:23.705 --> 02:24.937
My gift.

02:25.006 --> 02:26.372
That's right. We're giving those

02:26.441 --> 02:28.307
because of being boyfriend
and girlfriend.

02:28.376 --> 02:29.842
That was my thinking on the matter.

02:29.944 --> 02:31.944
And I've got your present ready, too.

02:32.013 --> 02:34.147
Except I put it...

02:34.215 --> 02:35.681
I don't know why I did this...

02:35.783 --> 02:37.583
it's up on our roof.

02:37.652 --> 02:39.819
And then we loaned our ladder
to one of our neighbors

02:39.888 --> 02:41.387
so they could decorate it for Christmas

02:41.456 --> 02:44.423
because they're poor and
can't afford a tree.

02:44.492 --> 02:46.942
Wow. What a surprising
sequence of events.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.061
I know.

02:48.062 --> 02:51.330
And when will they be taking
down their Christmas ladder?

02:51.399 --> 02:53.499
Traditionally, it's two or three days.

02:53.568 --> 02:56.636
Well, I will be in Riverside
'til Wednesday,

02:56.704 --> 02:58.337
so that should give you plenty of time

02:58.406 --> 03:00.706
- to get your ladder back.
- And fetch your present,

03:00.808 --> 03:02.508
which is right above our heads.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.343
Grr, that's so frustrating.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.512
Okay, see ya.

03:12.187 --> 03:14.320
Where's the shirt we got for Tom?

03:14.422 --> 03:17.089
Right here. I even stitched
a penguin on the pocket

03:17.192 --> 03:18.291
and put it in a May Company box

03:18.393 --> 03:19.725
so it looks like the real deal.

03:19.827 --> 03:21.694
I'll give him the fake shirt
in the fake box,

03:21.796 --> 03:23.563
and then clobber him with my saw.

03:23.665 --> 03:25.398
He won't know what hit him.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.866
Because he won't know he's in a fight

03:26.968 --> 03:28.434
that's all in your head.

03:28.536 --> 03:30.203
Sure, Tom earns in the high
five-figures,

03:30.305 --> 03:31.904
but it's not like he
rubs your face in it.

03:33.808 --> 03:35.875
Is that a Nicaragua earthquake?

03:38.646 --> 03:40.213
That's Uncle Tom's new car!

03:40.315 --> 03:41.814
Oh! Pat. Move, Pat!

03:45.320 --> 03:47.053
The man drove here in a house.

03:47.155 --> 03:49.457
Yep. No face-rubbin' at all.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.292
Merry Christmas, Cleary Clan!

03:52.363 --> 03:54.495
- Hey.
- Aww.

03:54.573 --> 03:55.906
Heck of a sleigh, Tommy.

03:55.975 --> 03:57.541
Right? Good to see you.

03:57.610 --> 03:59.176
He couldn't have parked
in the garage anyway

03:59.278 --> 04:01.345
because his awesome
Winnebago's way too big.

04:01.413 --> 04:02.824
Maybe he should have just
parked it in your mouth.

04:02.871 --> 04:04.070
How are things at the phone company?

04:04.172 --> 04:05.204
Dandy as candy.

04:05.306 --> 04:07.503
I'm now in charge of pay phones

04:07.613 --> 04:09.849
for the greater GTE service area.

04:09.944 --> 04:11.444
- Pay phones?
- Yeah.

04:11.553 --> 04:13.569
Holy moley... talk about job security.

04:13.616 --> 04:14.686
Yeah, it's big-time.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.216
Personally, I think it's a shame

04:16.257 --> 04:18.451
people don't write letters anymore.

04:18.553 --> 04:19.952
This RV's got a bathroom, right?

04:20.021 --> 04:21.887
Yeah! Knock yourself out.

04:21.956 --> 04:24.957
Oh, but first, help me unload
my two adorable elves.

04:25.026 --> 04:28.227
Hello, sweeties!

04:28.329 --> 04:29.862
Aunt Marge.

04:29.964 --> 04:32.698
Aww. There's Uncle Walter.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.200
What a surprise.

04:34.302 --> 04:35.501
Now I smell a campfire.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.637
I better go set out some ashtrays.

04:37.739 --> 04:39.105
How was your drive up?

04:39.174 --> 04:41.474
Can't imagine this whale
handles too well.

04:41.543 --> 04:43.187
Yeah, we're breaking this baby in.

04:43.272 --> 04:45.593
From here, we're headed
to the Circus Circus Hotel

04:45.640 --> 04:46.576
in Las Vegas.

04:46.577 --> 04:49.055
I hear that they train elephants
to deal blackjack

04:49.150 --> 04:50.683
and every room has a clown maid.

04:50.752 --> 04:52.919
At least that's how I'd do it.

04:52.987 --> 04:54.587
Man, oh man, this bathroom's nicer

04:54.656 --> 04:55.888
than the one we have in our house!

04:55.957 --> 04:57.957
Whoo-hoo, I'm next!

04:58.059 --> 05:00.259
Whoa. It has a stove, too?!

05:00.328 --> 05:01.761
Of course. What would be the point

05:01.830 --> 05:04.597
of a car without a stove?

05:04.666 --> 05:08.000
All right. Let's everybody
head into the real house

05:08.102 --> 05:10.369
for a proper Christmas celebration.

05:11.272 --> 05:12.605
<i>We knew what that meant...</i>

05:12.674 --> 05:14.440
<i>Dad was about to use us as pawns</i>

05:14.509 --> 05:16.876
<i>in his one-sided competition with Tom.</i>

05:16.945 --> 05:18.744
- Let's get started.
- Oh, boy.

05:18.847 --> 05:20.746
Timmy, do the joke you told
at Thanksgiving.

05:20.849 --> 05:22.048
You said it was stupid.

05:22.116 --> 05:24.984
Stupid not to share it.

05:25.086 --> 05:26.552
You know the one about
the baby that was so ugly

05:26.654 --> 05:27.887
he looked like a monkey,

05:27.989 --> 05:29.922
and the guy on the train
offered him a banana.

05:31.359 --> 05:32.825
You kind of gave the whole thing away.

05:32.894 --> 05:35.194
Fine. Get your stupid magic kit.

05:35.263 --> 05:36.896
- Yes!
- Frank, you're up!

05:36.965 --> 05:38.764
<i>This was Dad's way of using us kids</i>

05:38.833 --> 05:41.300
<i>to shove his manhood
in Tom's childless face.</i>

05:41.369 --> 05:43.402
<i>He made us perform
like the von Trapp family.</i>

05:43.471 --> 05:45.905
<i>Only we couldn't escape
by climbing up over the Alps.</i>

05:45.974 --> 05:47.607
Banana.

05:47.675 --> 05:49.842
This one is for Citizenship
in the Community.

05:49.911 --> 05:52.512
Uh, this one is for Citizenship
in the Nation.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.380
This one is for Citizenship
in the World...

05:54.482 --> 05:55.982
Skip to the, uh, prestige badges,

05:56.084 --> 05:57.884
- like bugling.
- Oh, I never got that one.

05:57.986 --> 05:59.952
I've been self-diagnosed
with medically weak lips.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:10.465 --> 06:14.467
And now to make the egg reappear,

06:14.536 --> 06:17.436
wave this wand over the bag,
Uncle Walter.

06:17.539 --> 06:18.871
Give it a good grip.

06:18.940 --> 06:21.140
He has crippling arthritis, sweetie.

06:21.242 --> 06:23.276
I had to tape that cigarette
to his fingers.

06:24.579 --> 06:25.578
- Oh.
- Ooh.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.413
- Mnh-mnh.
- Ta-da?

06:27.515 --> 06:29.448
Pat, show him your hernia scar.

06:29.517 --> 06:31.217
- Yay!
- Look at that.

06:31.286 --> 06:34.253
Cost me 600 bucks to get the kid's
insides rearranged properly.

06:34.355 --> 06:35.821
Okay, Pat, put your insides away.

06:35.890 --> 06:37.423
It's gift time.

06:37.492 --> 06:41.027
Tommy, we got you this.

06:41.129 --> 06:42.528
- Aww.
- Yeah.

06:42.630 --> 06:43.930
From the May Company.

06:44.032 --> 06:46.032
See the box?

06:46.134 --> 06:48.167
This is a really nice golf shirt!

06:48.237 --> 06:49.141
Thank you.

06:49.165 --> 06:51.214
We saw that while shopping
at the May Company.

06:51.239 --> 06:52.772
Thought of you.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.307
Grab that box for the "next year" pile,

06:54.375 --> 06:56.409
but be careful.
The corners are starting to go.

06:56.511 --> 06:58.344
All right. I got
a few gifts for you, too.

06:58.446 --> 06:59.812
- Joey.
- Oh!

06:59.914 --> 07:01.080
- Frank.
- Whoo!

07:01.149 --> 07:02.315
- Timmy.
- Oh, boy.

07:02.383 --> 07:04.383
- Eddie. Lawrence.
- This is it.

07:04.485 --> 07:06.252
- William.
- Yabba-dabba-doo.

07:06.354 --> 07:08.005
Pat.

07:09.290 --> 07:10.957
Pajamas?

07:11.025 --> 07:13.492
Pajamas aren't a gift.
Pajamas are something you have.

07:13.595 --> 07:14.994
I was really hoping it would be
something good

07:15.096 --> 07:16.529
I could pass along to Wendi.

07:16.598 --> 07:18.197
You boys be sure to thank your Uncle Tom

07:18.266 --> 07:20.800
for his generosity.

07:20.902 --> 07:22.735
What a crap present.

07:22.837 --> 07:26.806
Before we go, I have presents
for each of you boys.

07:26.874 --> 07:28.975
Now I didn't have time to go shopping.

07:29.077 --> 07:31.377
We actually prefer it when someone
doesn't have time to shop.

07:31.479 --> 07:33.713
Honestly, they don't deserve anything.
You're spoiling them.

07:33.781 --> 07:35.348
Please don't be Washington.
Please don't be Washington.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.083
Please don't be Washington.

07:37.151 --> 07:39.385
Lincoln! Him I can work with.

07:39.487 --> 07:41.520
<i>But my bill didn't have Honest Abe.</i>

07:41.589 --> 07:44.590
<i>Staring back at me was the man
responsible for bifocals,</i>

07:44.659 --> 07:46.959
<i>the lightning rod, and my best
Christmas in years...</i>

07:47.028 --> 07:49.161
<i>Benjamin Franklin.</i>

07:49.263 --> 07:51.764
<i>Was it a mistake? It had to be.</i>

07:51.833 --> 07:54.200
<i>I needed to confide in someone,
but whom?</i>

07:54.302 --> 07:56.168
<i>Frank was a total narc.</i>

07:56.237 --> 07:58.871
<i>Joey would literally murder me
in my sleep, then steal it.</i>

07:58.973 --> 08:00.773
<i>Lawrence would go all Charlie Church</i>

08:00.875 --> 08:02.241
<i>and guilt me into giving it back</i>

08:02.343 --> 08:03.909
<i>or donating it or something moronic.</i>

08:03.978 --> 08:05.578
<i>So that left Eddie.</i>

08:05.647 --> 08:10.116
And finally, I have one more
little Christmas surprise.

08:10.184 --> 08:11.917
Follow me!

08:15.056 --> 08:16.455
- Oh, whoa!
- Whoa!

08:16.557 --> 08:17.990
<i>And there it was,</i>

08:18.059 --> 08:20.059
<i>a big lump of coal in my dad's stocking.</i>

08:20.128 --> 08:24.430
23 inches of full color
with a built-in hi-fi stereo!

08:24.532 --> 08:26.666
Ho ho ho!

08:26.734 --> 08:29.201
<i>This was the worst Christmas
morning of my father's life.</i>

08:29.303 --> 08:31.203
<i>And that includes the one where
he walked into the kitchen</i>

08:31.272 --> 08:33.673
<i>and pushed himself up against
Lawrence thinking it was Mom.</i>

08:33.741 --> 08:35.006
Come on. Don't feel bad, honey.

08:35.109 --> 08:37.076
I told you he's just better.

08:37.178 --> 08:39.979
- A new TV!
- Thank you, baby Jesus!

08:40.081 --> 08:41.681
It's actually my old one. I upgraded,

08:41.783 --> 08:43.349
but it gets all the new shows.

08:43.451 --> 08:45.217
Well, it's certainly an
improvement over our old clunker.

08:45.319 --> 08:47.219
Tom, so generous.

08:47.288 --> 08:49.755
Too generous. We can't accept.

08:49.824 --> 08:51.493
- What?!
- Yeah, I'm with Dad on this one.

08:51.534 --> 08:52.733
Thank you, Lawrence.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.226
With the current decline in literacy,

08:54.328 --> 08:55.861
do you really think we need a TV at all?

08:55.930 --> 08:57.730
Okay, you've lost all credibility.

08:57.832 --> 08:59.865
This giant picture tube's a wattage hog.

08:59.934 --> 09:01.534
It will strain the wiring
and burn down the house.

09:01.636 --> 09:03.269
As long as we save the TV!

09:03.371 --> 09:04.570
We can't accept for safety reasons.

09:04.672 --> 09:06.172
Mike, honey, a word? In private?

09:06.240 --> 09:07.673
Hey, you guys go ahead. Yeah.

09:07.742 --> 09:09.508
I'll show the kids
the soft serve machine.

09:09.577 --> 09:10.743
Soft serve?!

09:10.812 --> 09:12.078
I live here now!

09:14.248 --> 09:16.015
If you got to go, use the RV.

09:16.117 --> 09:17.683
You can flush in there
without a bucket of water.

09:17.752 --> 09:20.286
- What are you doing?
- Creating a cone of silence.

09:20.354 --> 09:22.221
Look at what Aunt Marge
gave to me by accident.

09:23.357 --> 09:24.623
- Whoa.
- Yeah, I know.

09:24.726 --> 09:26.158
I feel terrible.

09:26.227 --> 09:28.728
- I need advice.
- I'm flattered you came to me.

09:28.796 --> 09:32.064
Well, you're not greedy or
evil or snitch-y or godly.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.166
You have no distinct
personality whatsoever,

09:34.235 --> 09:35.768
which makes your opinion more objective.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.870
Thank you. Let me think about this.

09:37.972 --> 09:39.338
But first, turn around.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.806
I'm holding in a lot of Shasta here.

09:40.908 --> 09:42.374
Are we some charity case?

09:42.477 --> 09:44.610
Are we on welfare like
the Mulroys at church

09:44.679 --> 09:46.378
that we're not supposed to know
about but everybody knows?

09:46.447 --> 09:47.913
Look, Tom's just trying
to do something nice,

09:47.982 --> 09:49.348
and you get all huffy about it.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.383
If I want my children to have
a giant TV,

09:51.452 --> 09:52.852
- I'll buy one for them.
- No, you won't.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.121
No, I won't because I don't
want them to, all right?

09:55.189 --> 09:56.856
They watch enough of that
idiot box as it is.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.224
You watch just as much, if not more.

09:58.326 --> 09:59.658
The damage to my brain is done.

09:59.727 --> 10:00.826
There's still hope for some of them.

10:00.895 --> 10:03.796
Mike, Peg, hey, if it's a problemo,

10:03.865 --> 10:05.431
I can just donate the TV.

10:05.533 --> 10:08.234
I mean, God knows I can use
the tax deductions.

10:08.302 --> 10:10.803
Tax deductions,
like he's Thurston Howell III.

10:10.905 --> 10:14.173
One thing... can I keep it here
for a few days?

10:14.242 --> 10:16.909
It just seems silly hauling it
across the Mojave

10:17.011 --> 10:19.845
when the RV already has a terrific TV.

10:19.914 --> 10:22.615
I guess we can store it
as a favor to you.

10:22.717 --> 10:24.950
- Thanks, Mike.
- Lawrence, Frank,

10:25.052 --> 10:26.218
unload the TV.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.520
- Oh!
- Yes!

10:27.622 --> 10:29.355
It's not staying. We're just storing it

10:29.457 --> 10:30.990
in the garage 'til Wednesday.

10:31.092 --> 10:33.125
We could store it indefinitely
up in the tree house.

10:33.227 --> 10:34.760
Really tie the space together.

10:36.164 --> 10:37.763
Eat your soft serve.

10:37.865 --> 10:41.100
Off the top of my head,
you could lend the money to <i> me.</i>

10:41.169 --> 10:42.868
Oh, yeah. That's your advice?

10:42.937 --> 10:44.436
- Give it to you?
- Okay, how about this?

10:44.505 --> 10:45.971
It's Christmas,
maybe give it to the Church.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.008
The Church? I could've
gotten that from Lawrence.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.810
I just think it's a little hinky

10:50.912 --> 10:52.478
to keep money you got by mistake.

10:52.547 --> 10:54.113
If it weren't for this Wendi situation,

10:54.182 --> 10:56.415
I would happily donate
my own $5 from Aunt Marge

10:56.517 --> 10:57.917
to those poor Nigerians.

10:58.019 --> 11:00.486
- Nicaraguans.
- I'm sure they both need it.

11:00.555 --> 11:02.288
Or you could just give
the money back to Aunt Marge

11:02.356 --> 11:03.689
and your conscience will be clear.

11:03.758 --> 11:05.257
<i>Eddie had a point.</i>

11:05.326 --> 11:06.725
<i>Giving the hundred back to Aunt Marge</i>

11:06.828 --> 11:08.561
<i>was really the right thing to do.</i>

11:08.629 --> 11:10.462
<i>Unfortunately, "the right thing to do"</i>

11:10.531 --> 11:12.998
<i>was currently chain-smoking
in an RV headed for Vegas.</i>

11:14.702 --> 11:17.770
<i>So, the next day, I decided to
do the next best thing...</i>

11:17.872 --> 11:21.073
<i>give it to those who needed it most.</i>

11:21.142 --> 11:23.042
See you later, Ben.

11:23.110 --> 11:24.944
Have fun in Nicaragua.

11:25.012 --> 11:28.414
<i>I started to leave, but Ben
looked so vulnerable there.</i>

11:28.516 --> 11:30.216
<i>So easily stolen.</i>

11:30.318 --> 11:32.618
<i>What if he fell into the wrong hands?</i>

11:32.687 --> 11:34.186
<i>At least in my hands,</i>

11:34.255 --> 11:36.055
<i>I would know the money went to good use.</i>

11:36.123 --> 11:39.391
<i>I decided to seek guidance
direct from the home office.</i>

11:39.493 --> 11:43.529
Baby Jesus, if you really want
me to leave the money, just...

11:45.533 --> 11:48.534
...make my hand open up
and drop it into the basket.

11:49.804 --> 11:51.804
Ouch! Ouch!

11:51.906 --> 11:53.973
Ouch. Hey, scram. Ouch, stop.

11:54.075 --> 11:56.208
No sign here as far as I can tell.

11:58.479 --> 12:01.280
Message received, Baby Jesus.

12:01.382 --> 12:02.948
Oh...

12:03.050 --> 12:04.617
and happy birthday.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.392
<i>That small issue settled,
I was able to relax</i>

12:08.422 --> 12:10.756
<i>and enjoy our annual viewing
of "White Christmas"...</i>

12:10.825 --> 12:13.559
<i>except on our TV it was more
like "Fuzzy Green Christmas."</i>

12:13.661 --> 12:15.227
<i>Certainly too bad General Waverly</i>

12:15.329 --> 12:16.662
- <i>couldn't have been here...</i>
- This is a great movie...

12:16.764 --> 12:18.731
it's got Christmas, it's got war.

12:18.799 --> 12:20.466
They throw in John Wayne on a horse...

12:20.534 --> 12:22.434
win the Oscar every year.

12:22.503 --> 12:23.903
Can you turn it up, please?

12:24.005 --> 12:25.437
- I can barely hear it.
- If we turn it up,

12:25.539 --> 12:27.406
it makes that high-pitched sound
that makes Pat vomit.

12:27.508 --> 12:30.542
The only high-pitched
sound I hear is whining.

12:30.645 --> 12:33.312
I got to use the john.

12:33.414 --> 12:36.949
<i>And so began our exodus from bondage.</i>

12:37.051 --> 12:39.852
I'm gonna re-marshmallow my cocoa.

12:39.954 --> 12:41.487
- I'm gonna stretch my legs.
- Yeah.

12:41.589 --> 12:43.489
I'll go stretch his legs, too.

12:43.557 --> 12:46.325
<i>After a point, we didn't even
bother coming up with excuses.</i>

12:56.304 --> 12:59.004
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

12:59.106 --> 13:00.472
How dare you?

13:00.574 --> 13:01.840
If it wasn't me, I'd ask who raised you

13:01.909 --> 13:03.542
'cause they did a terrible job.

13:03.644 --> 13:05.044
Disobeying your dad and abandoning

13:05.146 --> 13:07.112
a sacred family tradition
just so you can...

13:07.181 --> 13:11.650
Geez Louise, look how red
those poinsettias are!

13:11.752 --> 13:14.119
Oh. Bing doesn't look seasick.

13:14.221 --> 13:16.322
And no high-pitched squeal either.

13:16.424 --> 13:19.058
Scoot.

13:28.636 --> 13:30.069

13:31.739 --> 13:33.005

13:47.152 --> 13:49.713
I do not believe you kids.

13:49.824 --> 13:52.157
You knew that TV was off-limits!

13:52.259 --> 13:55.461
Despite its hi-fi stereo sound
and superior picture quality.

13:56.764 --> 13:58.364
Well, I hope you're happy.

13:58.466 --> 14:00.065
You ruined Christmas.

14:03.081 --> 14:04.987
I guess we've come up with
a new holiday tradition

14:05.081 --> 14:06.916
called "breaking Jesus' heart."

14:06.995 --> 14:10.225
- But, Mommy, you were just...
- I was just what?

14:10.298 --> 14:12.220
- I love you.
- That's what I thought.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.424
Don't let me kill the Christmas fun.

14:14.492 --> 14:16.036
I'm not the Grinch, or the Scrooge,

14:16.106 --> 14:17.918
or the Goldsteins
who don't put up a tree.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.224
Well, that's great, Pop.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.793
'Cause this shindig
just started cookin'!

14:21.862 --> 14:23.495
Yeah!

14:23.563 --> 14:26.264
I just came out to enjoy

14:26.333 --> 14:28.233
my new gift.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.868
Let's fire her up!

14:29.936 --> 14:31.436
Mike, do you...

14:31.505 --> 14:34.572
You really think now's the right
time to play with Becky?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.241
It's Christmas!

14:36.343 --> 14:38.396
Let it snow!

14:38.443 --> 14:41.312
- ♪ Run, run, Rudolph ♪
- This is the best Christmas ever!

14:41.415 --> 14:44.516
Ho ho ho ho.

14:50.791 --> 14:52.557
I think they got the message.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.527
<i>The hard part of coming into real money</i>

14:55.595 --> 14:57.962
<i>is holding onto it,
especially in my house</i>

14:58.064 --> 15:00.331
<i>where stuff had a way
of disappearing, Joey.</i>

15:00.400 --> 15:03.268
<i>I needed a good hiding place
where no one ever looked...</i>

15:03.336 --> 15:04.936
<i>the family Bible.</i>

15:06.139 --> 15:07.605
Don't touch that!

15:07.674 --> 15:10.008
- It's mine.
- Oh, my God.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.876
Aunt Marge accidentally
gave you a hundred, too!

15:11.945 --> 15:13.445
All right, fine.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.879
But you told me to donate
mine to the Church.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.548
It's a good deed...
the right thing to do.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.117
- But you kept yours.
- My good deed was convincing you.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.485
I figured it counted for both of us.

15:20.554 --> 15:21.953
How is that fair?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.488
You don't have a girlfriend
who needs a present.

15:23.557 --> 15:25.190
No, but I have a ventriloquist dummy

15:25.292 --> 15:26.758
and he likes nice things, as well!

15:26.860 --> 15:28.326
Timmy,

15:28.395 --> 15:30.228
I'm very disappointed in myself,

15:30.297 --> 15:32.197
but I thought I could count on you.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.998
I've got to say, you've let me down.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.036
I'm disappointed in you, too!

15:38.071 --> 15:39.804
<i>You've been sticking
at magic nose of yours</i>

15:39.873 --> 15:41.706
- <i>where it doesn't belong again.</i>
- Is this old Darrin

15:41.808 --> 15:43.374
or new Darrin?

15:43.476 --> 15:46.311
Who can tell in this teeny picture tube?

15:46.379 --> 15:50.715
Which is plenty big enough for us.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.784
<i>...which we now laughingly
call our anniversary.</i>

15:52.852 --> 15:55.053
You and Darrin have a lot in common.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.789
You're both proud men of principle.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.358
Not a sniveling worm like Larry Tate.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.560
Tate. That guy.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.797
If it weren't for Darrin's
strong stand on witchcraft,

16:05.899 --> 16:09.200
just think of the amazing things
Samantha could do...

16:09.302 --> 16:11.202
conjure up a new Kenmore dishwasher

16:11.271 --> 16:13.137
or end all wars.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.607
Oh, no point in her getting
mixed up in wars.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.142
Russia and China would just use
their witches...

16:18.244 --> 16:20.078
and you know they've got 'em.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.579
I'm with Darrin.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.048
The family should only
have what he can provide.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.017
Who cares if Tabitha and
little Adam do without?

16:26.086 --> 16:27.418
I'm sure Darrin <i> cares...</i>

16:27.487 --> 16:29.654
The important thing
is Darrin's self-respect.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.457
And winning that Meaty-Mutt
dog food account.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.159
You know, I think Endora turning
him into a Great Dane

16:35.261 --> 16:37.729
is gonna end up being
a big help on that.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.937
<i>I took the money and made my purchase.</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:47.905
<i>A Christmas present for me.</i>

16:48.008 --> 16:51.009
<i>Something every red-blooded,
American boy dreams of...</i>

16:51.111 --> 16:52.510
<i>tap shoes.</i>

16:54.614 --> 16:56.547
<i>Regular dancing... pfft.
That's for pikers.</i>

16:56.650 --> 16:59.217
<i>Now I could dance for blind people!</i>

16:59.319 --> 17:01.686
Here it is. Safe and sound.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.055
- Right where I left it.
- Up on the roof.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.923
Yes, ma'am. Oh, look,

17:06.026 --> 17:07.425
they left one of their ornaments.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.527
You mean the people
who borrowed your ladder

17:09.628 --> 17:10.828
to use as a Christmas tree?

17:10.896 --> 17:13.131
Yeah, them.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.832
Here you go.

17:14.934 --> 17:18.202
- Merry Christmas.
- Ooh, the May Company.

17:18.304 --> 17:21.172
Your mom let you use the box.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.807
Oh, my God, Eddie.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.942
- I love suede!
- Me too.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.411
It always looks so good on cows.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.880
And it really <i> is</i> from the May Company!

17:35.388 --> 17:37.822
Hey, Uncle Tom. How was Las Vegas?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.657
Ah, the oldsters had a blast.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.226
Buffets then craps, buffets then craps.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.828
And then in between, a little gambling!

17:45.632 --> 17:46.998
These two were so sweet together.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.434
They even talked about
renewing their vows.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.236
Then I reminded them they are
brother and sister.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.706
Okay, let's get that,
uh, present packed up

17:54.808 --> 17:56.708
and we'll get out of here.
Unless you changed your mind.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.577
I'll be glad to finally get
that thing out of my garage.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.845
Frank, Lawrence,

18:00.947 --> 18:02.814
the saw goes with your uncle.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.215
We're keeping the TV.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.483
- Yes!
- Yes!

18:05.585 --> 18:06.918
The saw?

18:06.986 --> 18:08.920
Peg and I somehow blanked
and forgot to give you

18:09.022 --> 18:10.655
your other gift.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.390
Are you sure?

18:12.459 --> 18:15.159
That saw is an expensive item
for you guys.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.295
Not as expensive as
the new, much better saw

18:17.397 --> 18:18.329
we're getting Mike.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.964
That's more of a beginner's model,

18:20.033 --> 18:22.200
you know, for people
who aren't skilled with tools

18:22.302 --> 18:23.401
like my husband.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.169
<i>To my dad, hearing Mom</i>

18:25.271 --> 18:27.138
<i>slightly malign
her brother's masculinity</i>

18:27.240 --> 18:28.973
<i>was the greatest
Christmas present of all.</i>

18:31.211 --> 18:32.577
You know what, Peg?
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.011
Well, sure.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.314
This is a little awkward,

18:36.416 --> 18:39.484
but I've been keeping track
of Marge's money for Las Vegas,

18:39.552 --> 18:42.620
you know, because, well,
she gets a little confused.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.388
I think she might have given
two of your boys

18:44.491 --> 18:47.658
$100 bills when she was
handing out those $5s.

18:47.761 --> 18:49.360
100 bucks?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.629
Aw, for her that's like
four days of cigarette money.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.097
But I'm sure your boys
would have said something.

18:53.199 --> 18:56.768
I keep forgetting
you don't have children.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.804
Hey! Which two of you
hooligans accepted $100

18:59.906 --> 19:01.272
from my sweet, unsuspecting aunt?

19:01.374 --> 19:03.641
- What? I got a $5.
- I got a $5, too.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.044
That's a nice suede jacket, Wendi.

19:07.113 --> 19:10.214
- Eddie got it for me.
- That's one.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.016
What are you doing
way over there, Timmy?

19:12.118 --> 19:13.818
All by yourself

19:13.920 --> 19:16.387
like a gazelle separated from the pack.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.622
Just hanging out.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.490
Come closer.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.098
And that's two.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.700
Aunt Marge, Timmy and Eddie
have something to tell you,

19:29.803 --> 19:30.935
if they know what's good for them.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.703
You gave us each $100 by mistake.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.740
That's no mistake. It's part
of my Las Vegas system.

19:35.809 --> 19:37.275
I always bet on red,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.844
so I gave my two redheads
$100 each for luck.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.580
Whoa! Thanks, Great Aunt Marge!

19:42.682 --> 19:44.649
I didn't know it, but I love you!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.117
Oh!

19:46.219 --> 19:47.585
Were you lucky in Vegas?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.020
Front-row center seats

19:49.122 --> 19:52.723
and a kiss from Mr. José Feliciano.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.126
Yeah, it was not José Feliciano.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.217
No.

19:56.242 --> 19:58.162
Can't have enough ashtrays
under those two chimneys.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.363
Thanks, Pegster.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.765
And thanks again for the saw, Mike.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.000
Hopefully I won't have to stop
abruptly on the freeway

20:03.102 --> 20:05.102
or it'll be a bloodbath.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.039
See you guys.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.443
I know it's silly pride, Peg,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.812
but giving ol' Becky to Tom

20:14.914 --> 20:15.947
was the only way I could come around

20:16.049 --> 20:17.415
to accepting his generosity.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.617
I'm more than happy
to trade Becky for Mitch.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.119
- Mitch?
- It's what I named the TV.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.922
And I think you had the wrong takeaway

20:25.024 --> 20:27.291
- from that "Bewitched" story.
- Hm?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.560
Darrin's kind of a clown for not
swallowing his pride

20:29.662 --> 20:30.828
once in a while and letting their kids

20:30.930 --> 20:32.463
have a few nice things.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.967
Either way, I'm grateful
for these network TV shows.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.934
They have so much to teach us
about how to be a family.

20:42.623 --> 20:44.435
<i>It ended up being a bountiful Christmas</i>

20:44.505 --> 20:47.312
- <i>for everyone after all.</i>
- Enough with the ridiculous shoes.

20:47.351 --> 20:48.498
You're scuffing up the floor.

20:48.555 --> 20:50.086
<i>I got to keep my tap shoes,</i>

20:50.164 --> 20:52.144
<i>Wendi got to keep her jacket,
which meant</i>

20:52.200 --> 20:54.166
<i>Eddie got to keep Wendi.
And, best of all,</i>

20:54.246 --> 20:57.093
<i>Mom got a fresh, new May Company box.</i>

20:57.156 --> 20:59.256
<i>Wendi's coat only lasted another season,</i>

20:59.358 --> 21:02.022
<i>but Mom reused that box
for many Christmases to come.</i>
