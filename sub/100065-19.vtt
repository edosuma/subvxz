WEBVTT

00:11.707 --> 00:15.537
So, why did you run this namethrough the NYPD database?

00:15.580 --> 00:16.886
It's not important.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.019
Is it related to a casewe're working on?

00:19.062 --> 00:20.977
No. It's fine. Don't
worry about it.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.500
Is it personal?

00:22.544 --> 00:25.025
It's got nothing to do
with you or this office.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.548
You can't do that, Anthony.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.028
What are you talking about?

00:28.071 --> 00:30.639
Unless this name is relatedto a case we're working on,

00:30.682 --> 00:33.076
then it's off-limits. Erin, you got to
be kidding me.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.600
No, I'm not. This officeis not for personal use.

00:35.644 --> 00:36.795
Yeah, well, then,
you want to tell that

00:36.819 --> 00:38.560
to the rest of the
Reagans who come in

00:38.603 --> 00:40.562
like they own the place,
asking you for favors?

00:40.605 --> 00:42.129
Okay, that's different, Anthony,

00:42.172 --> 00:44.740
because... Yeah, it's different
because it's your family,

00:44.783 --> 00:46.089
so they can waltz in, uh,

00:46.133 --> 00:47.873
whenever they want for
whatever they want.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.180
Come on, Anthon... Yeah, message received.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.139
I got to go. Look,

00:52.182 --> 00:53.879
you...

00:53.923 --> 00:55.533
Pick up.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.145
Anthony, please. Please pick up.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.152
Geo?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.765
Geo!

01:15.031 --> 01:17.381
Hello, beautiful.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.514
Who, me?

01:19.557 --> 01:20.993
How was your day?

01:21.037 --> 01:23.083
Let's see, do you want to hear

01:23.126 --> 01:25.389
about the suspicious odor call

01:25.433 --> 01:26.999
or the hit-and-run?

01:27.043 --> 01:28.566
I haven't eaten yet, so neither one.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.830
Do you hear that?

01:31.874 --> 01:33.571
Hear what? Shh.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.227
You think it's a cat?

01:39.186 --> 01:41.188
It's coming from over here.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.716
What is that? Oh, my God.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.440
Oh, my God, Jamie.
It's a baby.Okay.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.768
Is he okay?
He-He's alive.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.529
All right, get-get him up. Let's get him inside.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.207
Anybody, call it
in! We need a bus.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.860
We got a baby.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.384
Hey. What do we got?

02:03.427 --> 02:05.212
We gota male Hispanic DOA.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.909
Looks like he tooktwo to the chest.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.366
Best I can tell, he ran throughhere and went out the back door.

02:09.389 --> 02:11.348
Any witnesses? Not yet.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.742
Any lunch crowd? Owner
didn't see anything?

02:13.785 --> 02:15.222
He says he only saw the vic.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.919
Any idea of the shooter?

02:16.962 --> 02:18.355
Male wearing a hoodie,

02:18.399 --> 02:20.159
which pretty much describes
half the neighborhood.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.098
Oh. Well, great.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.317
Any security cameras?

02:23.360 --> 02:25.188
Just the front.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.973
ID? Only the phone.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.801
But the bodega owner
says he was in a hurry.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.152
Let's get a canvass started.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.328
That's funny.

02:34.371 --> 02:37.635
His last call
was to Anthony Abetemarco.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.161
Imagine that.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.254
He just got here.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.171
Okay.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.349
Hey, there he is.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.655
I'm sorry to just show up, but it's kind of important.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.459
Anytime. Anytime. Uh, it was just supposed to be

02:59.483 --> 03:01.093
like a regularschool assignment,

03:01.137 --> 03:02.791
and then this pops upand then... Hey.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.184
Take it easy.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.533
What assignment?

03:05.576 --> 03:08.231
Family ancestry. You know, you, like, spit in a tube,

03:08.275 --> 03:10.015
and you send it out, and they tell you

03:10.059 --> 03:11.515
all about your relatives. I understand DNA testing.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.801
What's the problem?

03:12.844 --> 03:14.455
Mine got a match.

03:15.456 --> 03:16.979
Okay.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.110
A first cousin.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.419
It's not Nicky. It's a guy.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.512
Well...

03:28.556 --> 03:30.819
your mom's brother Jimmy
was always kind of

03:30.862 --> 03:32.690
a loose cannon, so...

03:32.734 --> 03:35.127
Your side of the family.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.479
Oh.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.831
Either Erin or Jamie has a kid

03:42.874 --> 03:44.441
that no one knows about,

03:44.485 --> 03:47.662
or no one told me about...

03:49.533 --> 03:51.143
Could it be my dad?

03:51.187 --> 03:52.449
It's not your dad.

03:52.493 --> 03:55.104
It would have come back
as a sibling, so...

03:55.147 --> 03:57.411
that's out of the way, okay?

03:57.454 --> 03:59.195
Now, what do you know
about this guy?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.675
Just this.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.635
See how his lineconnects to us?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.768
Did you contact him?

04:06.811 --> 04:09.553
No. I didn't eventell my dad.

04:09.597 --> 04:10.728
I came straight here.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.254
I don't know, Sean.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.690
If there was a skeleton
in the family closet,

04:16.733 --> 04:18.519
I'm pretty sure
I'd know about it.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.868
It's no skeleton.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.478
It's a real-life guy,

04:21.522 --> 04:23.872
and he's justwalking around out there.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.080
Son of a bitch, it is him.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.821
You want to let us in
on what's going on?

04:59.864 --> 05:02.867
He's my witness in a case
against Juan Acosta.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.173
The head of the Apostles?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.498
Yeah. Acosta's about
to start trial

05:05.522 --> 05:08.133
for the murder of
a father of four,

05:08.177 --> 05:09.831
and Geo Valdez was
my star witness.

05:09.874 --> 05:12.703
Wow, you two didn't think
to have protection on him?

05:12.747 --> 05:14.401
Protection was supposedto start tomorrow.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.465
That's when I was supposed to

05:15.489 --> 05:17.447
hand over his name
to the defense.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.753
We wanted to start it sooner.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.600
He didn't want to gettaken off the street yet.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.688
Well, it looks like he's
off the street permanently

05:21.712 --> 05:22.800
now, doesn't it?

05:22.844 --> 05:24.846
Yeah, well, without Geo,
I have no case.

05:24.889 --> 05:28.153
That is, unless we can prove
Acosta ordered the hit.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.609
Well, you better
figure it out fast

05:29.633 --> 05:31.156
'cause the trial starts
in two days,

05:31.200 --> 05:32.897
and I don't want Acosta
walking free.

05:32.941 --> 05:35.030
Course not.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.348
She wouldn't saywhat she wants.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.349
Do you want me to stay?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.002
No. It's okay.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.482
I met her a long time ago.

05:52.526 --> 05:55.877
I know her parents,
and I got some free time.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.619
Otherwise, I'd just sit here
and worry about something.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.671
Paula Hill.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.064
Nice to see you again.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.500
Hello, Commissioner.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.545
Please, sit down.

06:15.679 --> 06:19.074
So, it's been a long time.Yes.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.859
The last time I talked to you, you were trying to convince me

06:21.903 --> 06:23.295
not to drop out of the academy.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.646
Yeah, I lost that one.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.823
Turns out my son hascarried on that tradition.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.215
He's in the firearms unit.

06:30.259 --> 06:33.088
Really?
Congratulations.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.569
Which is why I am here.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.052
I would like you to transfer him

06:41.096 --> 06:42.837
to either the 6-4 in Brooklyn

06:42.880 --> 06:45.970
or the 1-16 squad in Queens.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.189
For what reason?

06:49.278 --> 06:53.064
Because your son Joewas his father.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.769
And because, as his mother,

07:01.812 --> 07:03.988
I'd like him to have
a safer assignment.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.910
I dropped out of the academy
because I was pregnant.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.833
Did my son...

07:22.877 --> 07:25.270
Did he know? No.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.403
I kept it from him.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.319
May I ask why?

07:30.362 --> 07:32.669
Because I had no interest
in being in a relationship

07:32.713 --> 07:33.714
at the time.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.367
Because I knewif I told him,

07:35.411 --> 07:37.457
he'd insist ongetting married.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.807
Or at least wantto be involved in raising him.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.202
It was just a fling.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.814
We were never gonna be
each other's soul mates.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.948
And why now?

07:50.992 --> 07:55.736
Because he has always been
asking who his father was.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.524
And now he's doing DNA testing.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.056
He was no more
than two hours old

08:12.100 --> 08:14.121
when you picked him up,
umbilical cord still attached.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.277
But he's gonna be okay?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.409
His body temperature
was dangerously low,

08:17.453 --> 08:18.996
but there was no visible
signs of injury.

08:19.020 --> 08:19.977
So, healthy?

08:20.021 --> 08:21.501
He's in the NICU.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.696
Had to be put on oxygen, and
we have no medical history,

08:23.720 --> 08:27.681
but I'd say an extremely
unlucky kid.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.702
Unlucky? I thou... I thought yousaid he was gonna be okay.

08:29.726 --> 08:30.901
Oh, he will be.

08:30.945 --> 08:34.078
But abandoned by your mother
and left to die?

08:34.121 --> 08:35.905
I'd call that unlucky.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.916
Hey.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.615
Hi.
What's wrong?

08:48.658 --> 08:51.879
This whole thing is wrong.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.271
Mm.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.535
Any word from the mother?

08:55.578 --> 08:56.884
The detectives have the case.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.712
They put a word out

08:58.755 --> 09:01.410
to ERs to look out for mothers
seeking medical attention,

09:01.453 --> 09:02.605
then they're starting
the canvass.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.414
I want to work the canvass.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.200
Eddie... Eddie,
your tour's over.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.811
You should go home.No.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.377
I have to do this.

09:12.421 --> 09:15.076
Hey, you're letting
this get personal.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.706
It doesn't get any morepersonal than this.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.011
Which is exactly why
you shouldn't do it.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.081
This is exactly why I should.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.387
How many times do we
deal with situations

09:22.431 --> 09:23.867
that we can't change?

09:23.911 --> 09:25.739
Most of the time
we respond to calls

09:25.782 --> 09:29.264
where someone has already been
raped or murdered or mugged.

09:30.918 --> 09:35.705
But this... this is a chance
where we can do something

09:35.749 --> 09:38.969
that could change
this kid's life forever.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.542
Last night, I was playing
Call of Dutywith him.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.326
Today I'm picking out
funeral clothes.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.111
We're very sorry for your loss.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.940
And now you're telling me he wascooperating with the police

09:52.983 --> 09:54.332
against Juan Acosta?

09:54.376 --> 09:56.508
No wonder he was killed.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.946
Teddy, do you think Acostahad something to do with it?

09:58.989 --> 10:01.296
Come on. Why else?

10:01.339 --> 10:03.515
Geo had no enemies. Did your brother confide

10:03.559 --> 10:05.517
in you at all about
what he was doing?

10:05.561 --> 10:06.823
You know, testifying?

10:06.867 --> 10:10.087
No. My brother spent his life
protecting me.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.151
You think Geo told anyone else?

10:11.175 --> 10:14.048
A friend? A girlfriend, maybe?

10:14.091 --> 10:15.440
No way.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.181
He and his girl were fighting.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.618
Fighting about what?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.141
She thought he was
cheating on her.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.751
And was he? No.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.231
When he wasn't hanging with her,

10:23.274 --> 10:24.667
he was hanging with me,

10:24.711 --> 10:26.626
but she didn't believe him.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.193
Do you have any idea
who he was with last night?

10:29.237 --> 10:32.370
I know he met her at DeTitta's.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.329
After that, I don't know.

10:34.372 --> 10:37.027
So he was with his girlfriend,
who he's fighting with.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.203
Any idea where we can find her?

10:39.247 --> 10:42.250
I know she works at a cafe
on Second Ave.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.600
I just...

10:47.168 --> 10:50.171
I can't believe he's gone.

10:52.564 --> 10:55.176
Once again, we're really sorry.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.095
His nameis Joseph Hill.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.271
Graduated the academyin 2016.

11:03.314 --> 11:06.056
Got assigned to Brooklyn North.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.797
Currently, he's working
as a detective

11:07.841 --> 11:09.756
in the Firearms
Investigation Unit.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.802
How did he get FIU when he'sonly been on the job four years?

11:12.846 --> 11:14.804
He intervened in
a bodega robbery.

11:14.848 --> 11:15.805
Subdued the perp without injury.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.329
Saved a young womanand a baby.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.157
Got his choiceof assignments off that.

11:22.159 --> 11:25.162
You want to tell me why
we're looking into him?

11:25.206 --> 11:26.947
Not particularly.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.993
I'd like to meet
with Detective Hill,

11:30.037 --> 11:31.125
please set it up.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.695
Uh, what do I tell himthe reason is?

11:35.738 --> 11:39.133
That his police commissioner
requests a meeting.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.574
That is all.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.430
Something on your mind?

12:15.473 --> 12:18.694
No. There's something on yours.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.354
Detective Joe Hill
is my grandson.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.401
Oh.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.232
Exactly.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.757
Named Joe after his father?

12:37.800 --> 12:41.064
Um... I assume so.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.500
Does he know?

12:42.544 --> 12:45.939
Well... I don't think so,
but I'm not sure.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.636
How are you gonna handle it?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.945
With care for all concerned.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.163
How's thatgo?

12:54.164 --> 12:57.907
I have no idea.

12:57.951 --> 13:01.519
We just have a few questions.
This shouldn't take long.

13:01.563 --> 13:04.696
Mr. Acosta, can you give usyour whereabouts yesterday

13:04.740 --> 13:07.743
between the hoursof 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.? At the gym.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.094
Did you communicate with anyone, uh, other than your attorney?

13:11.138 --> 13:12.269
No.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.725
We'll be checking
your phone records.

13:13.749 --> 13:14.706
Are you suggestinghe's lying?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.099
Yes, I am.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.294
My client agreedto speak with you.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.841
He doesn'thave to cooperate.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.123
Your client shouldn't
even be out on bail

13:20.147 --> 13:21.365
as far as I'm concerned.

13:21.409 --> 13:22.802
He has no criminal history.

13:22.845 --> 13:23.953
Oh, he's got criminal history,

13:23.977 --> 13:25.326
he just hasn't been caught.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.197
Ain't that right, Mr. Acosta?

13:27.241 --> 13:28.938
That would only imply
I'm better at my job

13:28.982 --> 13:30.548
than you are at
yours, Detective.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.309
Are you planning to fileadditional charges?

13:32.333 --> 13:34.204
Not yet.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.817
But one of our witnesseswas murdered. Geo Valdez.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.209
That's too bad.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.559
Shut your mouth.
My client

13:41.603 --> 13:43.213
just gave youhis alibi.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.476
Your client could have
ordered a hit.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.914
My client is a businessman
being wrongfully prosecuted.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.959
Is that what you tell yourselfto feel better

13:50.003 --> 13:51.134
about representing him?

13:51.178 --> 13:52.832
Your witness was murdered.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.660
Maybe you should do a better
job of protecting him.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.445
Yeah, 'cause it
sounds to me like

13:57.488 --> 14:01.841
without this witness...
you got dick.

14:03.277 --> 14:06.019
Do not say another word.
Get up. Meeting's over.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.021
We'll see you in court.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.122
Commissioner?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.395
Joe Hill.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.583
Welcome.

14:48.626 --> 14:52.935
Commissioner. It's a real
pleasure to meet you.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.419
I'm sorry, I didn't have timeto change into my dress uniform.

14:55.459 --> 14:56.784
We just took down a case
in Hunt's Point

14:56.808 --> 14:58.090
when I got the call
to come down here.

14:58.114 --> 15:01.770
Understood. Have a seat.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.559
How'd the operation go?

15:08.603 --> 15:11.867
Little hairy at first,
then one for the good guys.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.217
And the haul? Seven handguns,

15:14.261 --> 15:16.437
fully automatic long gun,
nine keys of heroin.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.569
All in a day's work.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.789
Never a dull moment.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.965
And you're the youngest
detective in your unit.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.968
Guys I work with,
they're the best.

15:26.012 --> 15:29.363
Well, your record
seems to indicate

15:29.406 --> 15:31.147
they feel the same way
about you.

15:35.195 --> 15:39.460
Tell me something.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.462
Why did you request Firearms?

15:41.505 --> 15:44.726
I didn't join the department
to get cats out of trees.

15:44.769 --> 15:45.727
You know what I mean?

15:45.770 --> 15:49.644
I do.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.515
I do.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.823
I know the job runs
deep in your family.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.741
And yours, too.

15:59.784 --> 16:04.572
Well... not like you
Reagans.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.711
Am I in trouble
for something, sir?

16:14.756 --> 16:18.020
No.

16:18.064 --> 16:21.458
No. I'm just calling in membersof specialized units

16:21.502 --> 16:24.244
to get the lay of the land
from the guys in the trenches.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.288
That's all.

16:25.332 --> 16:29.118
Well... things are
great on my end.

16:29.162 --> 16:32.556
Terrific COs, dedicated
guys in my unit.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.602
I'm happy to be here.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.039
Good.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.825
Is there anything else, sir?

16:40.869 --> 16:44.351
No. Just... thanksfor the good work.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.835
Hey, green. Color of the day?

16:50.879 --> 16:52.489
Yeah.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.100
For my unit to be effective,

16:54.143 --> 16:56.319
we sometimes need to blend
in with the population.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.453
Color of the day... don't leave home without it.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.281
Yeah.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.459
Well...

17:12.335 --> 17:13.858
Watch your six.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.425
Always, sir.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.270
Camila Garcia? Detectives Reagan and Baez.

17:34.314 --> 17:37.056
Need to ask youa few questions about Geo. I don't know anything.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.710
That seems to be a running themein your neighborhood.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.061
Yeah. It's called survival.

17:42.104 --> 17:45.325
You know anyonewho'd want to harm Geo? I just told you, no.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.589
Really? Then why did Teddysay that you two were fighting? What does this

17:48.632 --> 17:49.851
have to do with anything?

17:49.894 --> 17:51.089
Shouldn't you be looking for
who killed him?

17:51.113 --> 17:53.463
Did you know that Geowas gonna testify

17:53.507 --> 17:55.596
against Juan Acosta
in a murder trial?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.554
No.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.382
I didn't think
he'd be that stupid.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.557
Why is that stupid?

18:00.601 --> 18:03.560
Because Acosta owns
this neighborhood.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.432
You know what else is stupid?

18:05.475 --> 18:09.523
Cooperating with the cops.
That's what got him killed.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.742
When did you see Geo last?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.094
We met at DeTitta's.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.921
What'd you two talk about?

18:17.966 --> 18:21.056
We talked about getting married.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.927
Okay?

18:22.971 --> 18:25.974
Does that sound like two peoplewho are fighting to you?

18:33.634 --> 18:35.157
Hey, how'd the canvass go?

18:35.201 --> 18:37.246
I froze my butt off for nothing.

18:37.290 --> 18:40.162
Anything come back
on the... duffel bag?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.140
I'm gonna send it to the crimelab, see if anything comes back

18:42.164 --> 18:43.992
on prints or DNA.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.275
I'm gonna go to local stores
and see if anyone sells it. Hey, Eddie...

18:46.299 --> 18:48.146
And don't tell me to leave this
to the detectives, Jamie,

18:48.170 --> 18:49.606
I don't want to hear that.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.131
I will work on this on my
own time if I have to, okay?

18:52.174 --> 18:53.741
Actually...

18:55.351 --> 18:57.614
I was gonna see if you
wanted my help with it.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.268
Oh? Yeah.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.680
In fact, I've already
called a bunch of places.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.097
There are only three stores

19:02.141 --> 19:04.075
that sell bags like that
near here. I figure we take

19:04.099 --> 19:06.033
a picture of the duffel, see
if any of 'em recognize it.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.582
I thought you were gonna tell meto take a step back.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.931
Yeah, well, I've
kind of realized

19:09.974 --> 19:12.455
when you're standing on
a cliff ready to jump,

19:12.499 --> 19:14.065
I can't ask you to
take a step back.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.981
So... my best
bet is to just

19:17.025 --> 19:19.158
take your hand and
jump with you.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.900
Well... then let's go.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.034
Hey, Danny.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.167
I tracked downthe security footage

19:28.210 --> 19:29.709
from the restaurantfrom where your vic

19:29.733 --> 19:31.233
met with his girlfriendbefore he was killed.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.303
And? They met for about an hourand a half.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.652
Okay, so what's the headline?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.350
Let me show you.

19:39.352 --> 19:42.833
Look like they're getting along. Maybe she told the truth.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.531
Keep watching.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.844
She's going
through his phone? She's taking pictures

19:53.888 --> 19:55.498
of what's on his phone.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.631
Son of a bitch. That's what girls do

19:57.674 --> 19:58.782
when they thinktheir boyfriend is cheating.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.242
Yeah, or testifying.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.679
I'd love to see
what's on his phone.Yeah.

20:02.723 --> 20:05.552
Except now we need to see
what's on herphone.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.341
Hello.

20:12.385 --> 20:13.492
Do you carry Raver brand
duffel bags?

20:13.516 --> 20:14.865
Yeah. Back wall.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.519
Do me a favorand look at this photo,

20:16.563 --> 20:17.912
see if you recognizethis bag?

20:17.955 --> 20:19.827
You a sergeant?

20:19.870 --> 20:21.350
Yeah.

20:21.394 --> 20:22.612
Love cops.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.528
Um, the bag?

20:25.572 --> 20:28.705
Yeah. Those are pretty popular.

20:28.749 --> 20:31.012
Want me to show you
where they are?

20:31.055 --> 20:32.796
Um, actually, we're lookingfor a woman

20:32.840 --> 20:34.296
in particular
who might have purchased

20:34.320 --> 20:35.495
one of these recently.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.931
Yeah, a pregnant woman.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.367
Or she might havejust given birth.

20:38.411 --> 20:41.892
Yeah. There was a pregnant
woman in here yesterday.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.609
I remember her 'cause
she was kind of upset.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.374
Upset, how?

20:45.418 --> 20:48.247
I don't know. Just looked
like she'd been crying.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.074
She kept asking
for an insulated bag,

20:50.118 --> 20:51.162
so I showed her that one,

20:51.206 --> 20:52.575
'cause it's the heaviest one
we have.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.078
What did she look like?

20:54.122 --> 20:55.732
She was pregnant.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.081
Dark hair,

20:57.125 --> 20:58.735
I don't really remember.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.911
Well, did she pay with cash
or credit?

21:00.955 --> 21:04.263
Do you know how many
people I help a day?

21:04.306 --> 21:06.569
Well, uh, could you go through
the receipts and see?

21:08.658 --> 21:10.138
And what do I get
for doing that?

21:11.705 --> 21:14.142
You get to be a hero.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.797
Okay.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.974
What? A hero?

21:20.017 --> 21:21.845
Could help us with the baby.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.765
Hey, what's this all about? Don't look at me.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.767
Your dad asked meto call you.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.293
There he is.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.833
Thank you.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.183
Okay.

21:55.226 --> 21:58.404
Joe fathered a son
he never knew about.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.538
What?

22:02.582 --> 22:04.497
Oh, my God.

22:07.238 --> 22:10.154
Wow. I did not see
that one coming.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.113
- Nor I.
- We don't know

22:12.156 --> 22:14.420
anything about this. Did you
know something about this?

22:14.463 --> 22:17.074
Yeah, it started with my familyancestry project for school.

22:18.511 --> 22:22.950
Detective Joe Hill ofthe Firearms Investigation Unit.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.647
The NYPD Firearms Unit?

22:24.691 --> 22:25.822
Yeah.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.084
No way.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.956
Oh, yeah.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.499
How do we know that our Joedidn't know about him?

22:30.523 --> 22:32.829
His mother told me.

22:32.873 --> 22:36.485
Sure it isn't some kind
of scam or something?

22:36.529 --> 22:39.009
Yeah, you sure
this whole thing checks out?

22:39.053 --> 22:41.379
They use the same DNA tests thatyou guys use for crime scenes.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.144
Very accurate.

22:43.187 --> 22:46.669
So, what... this makes him
25, 26?

22:46.713 --> 22:48.192
24.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.325
Does he know about us?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.501
I don't think so.

22:52.545 --> 22:53.676
Have you met him?

22:53.720 --> 22:55.809
Yeah, I did.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.201
What's he like?

22:58.246 --> 22:59.682
What's he like?

22:59.726 --> 23:02.598
I-I just met the guy,

23:02.642 --> 23:06.472
and, uh, he's my grandson.

23:08.517 --> 23:13.000
I will say this. Uh, he carrieshimself in a certain way.

23:13.043 --> 23:17.700
The way he kind of sets himselfbefore he's gonna say something.

23:17.744 --> 23:18.875
You know what I mean?

23:18.919 --> 23:20.790
Yeah, I do.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.097
Kind of like...

23:23.140 --> 23:25.142
Exactly like...

23:26.840 --> 23:28.407
Was it eerie?

23:28.450 --> 23:32.062
No, it was more like familiar.

23:32.106 --> 23:35.239
Same way he talked
about being on the job.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.589
Well, how was that?

23:36.632 --> 23:38.808
Like all of you when
you first came on.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.463
Like being a cop was like
playing for the Bulls

23:41.507 --> 23:44.292
with Jordan or the drums
with Springsteen.

23:44.335 --> 23:46.903
It was just familiar.

23:46.947 --> 23:50.820
I'm just blown away.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.735
Yeah, tell me about it.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.172
Personally, I can't wait
to meet the guy.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.436
When do you think
that can happen?

23:57.479 --> 23:59.263
How'sthat gonna happen?

23:59.307 --> 24:01.744
I have no idea.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.746
Why don't we just invite
him to Sunday dinner?

24:03.790 --> 24:06.270
Well, there's one other thing.

24:06.314 --> 24:09.448
If you walk in his shoes,
how's he gonna feel

24:09.491 --> 24:13.495
when he finds out who's on his
father's side of the family?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.280
He's one of us. He'll be fine.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.022
Pop has spoken.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.460
I think we should
meet him together.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.592
I'm in.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.159
Me, too.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.769
Me, three.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.383
Okay.

24:39.086 --> 24:42.481
So, he and his mother are comingto family dinner?

24:42.524 --> 24:44.526
I guess. You guess?

24:44.570 --> 24:47.224
I just don't want to see
my dad get hurt.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.270
Why do you think
your dad might get hurt?

24:49.313 --> 24:52.447
All I know is, this guy'sa complete stranger,

24:52.491 --> 24:54.164
and how do you make up
for all that lost time?

24:54.188 --> 24:56.146
That is what I'm saying
about this baby.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.235
Hmm. He could grow up
never knowing

24:58.279 --> 24:59.628
who his mother is.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.543
How could you

25:01.587 --> 25:05.678
leave him outside, not knowing
what was gonna happen to him?

25:05.721 --> 25:08.637
Maybe she's young, maybeshe's assuming he'll get adopted

25:08.681 --> 25:09.682
by a great family.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.553
Maybe she's a psychopath.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.861
I think she dropped him in frontof the precinct for a reason.

25:14.904 --> 25:17.385
If she loved him, she would
not have abandoned him.

25:17.428 --> 25:20.910
She would have made sure
that he found a good home.

25:22.303 --> 25:25.436
I know one way to make surehe goes to a good home.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.438
Do not even go there.

25:27.482 --> 25:30.572
You would not agree
to adopt a dog.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.836
You're telling me
you would adopt Cayden?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.534
Cayden?

25:35.577 --> 25:38.580
Yeah, I forgot to tell you,
I-I gave him a name.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.670
It means "great fighter."

25:41.714 --> 25:43.082
But you're not getting
too attached or anything.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.891
No, I'm not. I'm...

25:44.934 --> 25:46.588
That's not what I'm saying.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.547
What are you saying?

25:48.590 --> 25:54.378
I'm... saying maybe he is betteroff if we don't find his mother.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.908
What do we got?

26:01.951 --> 26:05.215
She erased the screenshots fromher photos and from the trash,

26:05.259 --> 26:07.217
but it automatically
backed up to Photobank.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.934
And these two platforms
aren't connected anymore,

26:08.958 --> 26:10.569
so the existing photos
are still there.

26:10.612 --> 26:13.572
Okay. Show me the pictures
she took of Geo's phone.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.356
"Acosta doesn't
suspect anything,

26:15.399 --> 26:18.664
but I want time to get my familysquared away before I testify."

26:18.707 --> 26:21.362
And these are texts
between Geo and who?

26:21.405 --> 26:23.364
Uh, the D.A.'s office.

26:23.407 --> 26:26.019
Did she send these pictures
to anyone?

26:26.062 --> 26:28.630
Yeah. The numbercomes back to a...

26:28.674 --> 26:30.066
Don't say Juan Acosta.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.503
Juan Acosta.

26:35.681 --> 26:36.769
Something wrong?

26:36.812 --> 26:39.336
Yeah, Camila got
her boyfriend whacked.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.775
May I approach the bench?

26:42.818 --> 26:44.167
Yeah, let's make it quick.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.392
My main witness was murdered.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.370
A delay in the trial
won't raise him from the dead,

26:53.394 --> 26:54.525
as far as I know.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.223
I have reason to believe
that Mr. Acosta

26:56.266 --> 26:57.790
is connected to the murder.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.227
There's reason to believel'll get a date with Brad Pitt.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.272
But without evidence,
there's no valid reason

27:02.316 --> 27:03.752
to inconvenience the court.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.406
Mr. Acosta is a
very dangerous man.

27:05.449 --> 27:08.670
He's been accused
of murder in the past and...

27:08.714 --> 27:10.150
But he's never been convicted.

27:10.193 --> 27:13.457
She's right. Facts, Counselor,
not conjecture, please.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.285
I'm asking for three days,
that's it.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.897
I cannot in good conscience
inconvenience a jury

27:17.940 --> 27:20.726
and delay a trial with nothing
more to go on than a hunch.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.684
It's more than a hunch,
Your Honor.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.488
It is without supporting
evidence, Counselor.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.516
I don't see a reason
to delay proceedings.

27:28.559 --> 27:29.996
I'll hearopening arguments

27:30.039 --> 27:32.041
tomorrow morning.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.180
I think it's further up.

27:40.223 --> 27:42.182
I think that's her.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.357
Hey, can we ask you

27:43.400 --> 27:44.706
a few questions?

27:44.750 --> 27:45.968
Hi.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.667
Is this you?

27:48.710 --> 27:50.538
No.Don't lie to us.

27:50.581 --> 27:53.846
You left your baby outside ofa police precinct in the cold!

27:53.889 --> 27:55.848
No.No? And you're gonnalie to us right now?

27:55.891 --> 27:58.024
Are you gonna lie
to me right now?!

27:58.067 --> 28:00.200
Take it easy.

28:02.419 --> 28:03.551
You bought a duffel bag

28:03.594 --> 28:06.075
at Empire StateSporting Goods?

28:07.207 --> 28:08.295
We want to help you.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.993
Your baby had hypothermia.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.734
Eddie. Eddie.

28:12.778 --> 28:13.735
Easy.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.258
Is he okay?

28:15.302 --> 28:18.914
Is my baby okay?
Please, is he okay?

28:18.958 --> 28:20.742
He's okay. He's in a hospital.

28:20.786 --> 28:24.093
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.314
Sorry. Please...

28:27.357 --> 28:29.272
I already told you everything.

28:29.316 --> 28:32.058
Except the part about youratting out your own boyfriend.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.234
I don't know what
you're talking about. Yes, you do.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.932
You told Acosta that Geo
was gonna testify against him.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.170
I don't even know what you mean.

28:38.194 --> 28:39.674
Then why'd you go
through Geo's phone?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.763
I didn't.You went throughGeo's phone

28:41.807 --> 28:44.766
and you took pictures
of his personal text messages.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.289
I was only going
through his phone

28:46.333 --> 28:47.943
to make sure
he wasn't cheating on me.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.510
Really? Then whydidn't you take

28:49.553 --> 28:51.096
any pictures of himtexting other girls?

28:51.120 --> 28:55.908
Instead of taking a picture
of him texting with the D.A.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.301
about testifying against Acosta?

29:00.826 --> 29:03.176
And you got Geo killed doing it.

29:03.219 --> 29:06.005
If Geo testified, Acosta would automatically think

29:06.048 --> 29:08.137
I knew about it,
and he'd have me killed, too.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.139
So you sacrificed
your own boyfriend?

29:10.183 --> 29:11.837
No, he sacrificed me!

29:11.880 --> 29:13.534
You could save yourself
right now,

29:13.577 --> 29:15.928
'cause you're looking
at accessory to murder.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.581
Tell me whothe shooter was

29:17.625 --> 29:20.236
and I'll help you out.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.847
No.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.937
You do realize that if Acosta
finds out you were up here,

29:24.980 --> 29:27.809
even just visiting a friend,
he's gonna assume

29:27.853 --> 29:30.290
you're cooperating, too,
and you're as good as dead.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.900
How will he even know?

29:31.944 --> 29:35.817
You like taking photos
and sending them to Acosta.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.168
We could take one, too.
And I'll send it to him.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.127
Say cheese.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.998
You can't do that. Sure, I can.

29:43.042 --> 29:45.281
Unless you want to help me outand tell me who the shooter was.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.524
You have no idea
how scared I am.

29:47.568 --> 29:50.049
Don't you think Geo was scared?!

29:50.092 --> 29:51.920
And now he's dead!

29:53.617 --> 29:55.576
Tell me who the shooter was.

29:58.927 --> 30:01.364
I heard it was
a guy named Cortez.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.018
He works for Acosta.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.106
Where do I find him?

30:04.150 --> 30:05.586
He lives in the Garfield Houses,

30:05.629 --> 30:07.309
but you better get there
before Teddy does.

30:08.371 --> 30:09.982
Why the hell
is Teddy going there?

30:10.025 --> 30:11.940
He found out
Cortez was the shooter.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.637
When? Couple hours ago.

30:13.681 --> 30:15.291
He's looking for revenge.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.779
Could I ask you something?

30:28.522 --> 30:30.829
Did my son Joe,

30:30.872 --> 30:33.309
did he talk about
our family in a way

30:33.353 --> 30:37.661
that made you want to keep
your son away from us?

30:37.705 --> 30:40.229
How do you mean?

30:41.274 --> 30:42.971
I'm not sure.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.887
Just a thought
that won't go away.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.847
He had nothing but love
and respect for you.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.413
But...?

30:50.457 --> 30:53.242
But nothing. It was on me.

30:53.286 --> 30:55.766
I just felt,
for all Joe would talk about

30:55.810 --> 30:58.769
w-walking in his father
and grandfather's footsteps,

30:58.813 --> 31:00.859
that he'd also be
walking in their shadows.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.773
And I wanted my son

31:02.817 --> 31:04.732
to be free to make
his own choices.

31:04.775 --> 31:07.561
Good for you.

31:07.604 --> 31:12.044
But this week has forced my handin ways I did not see coming.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.047
So you told him.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.875
Yeah.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.093
Everything?

31:18.137 --> 31:19.094
Yes.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.400
How'd he react?

31:20.443 --> 31:22.228
With a thousand questions.

31:22.271 --> 31:26.536
And with a laugh, looking back
at his meeting in this office.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.297
He said he knew somethingwas up, but he couldn't

31:28.321 --> 31:29.844
quite put his finger on it.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.629
So much for my poker face.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.129
Look, I'm glad
you're coming to dinner.

31:34.153 --> 31:37.243
We can answer his questions
in person.

31:37.286 --> 31:40.637
Yeah. So, what about
his reassignment?

31:44.598 --> 31:48.776
You know, I've thought
about that for years now.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.084
What do you mean?

31:54.216 --> 31:58.351
Should I have leaned on placingmy son in a less active unit?

31:58.394 --> 32:01.876
Would he still be
with us today if I had?

32:03.878 --> 32:05.967
So you dounderstand.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.883
Course I do.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.494
Thank you.

32:13.801 --> 32:17.631
I also understand... uh, I know...

32:17.674 --> 32:22.984
That we lose cops to friendly
fire, to senseless execution,

32:23.028 --> 32:24.464
to suicide.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.988
A rookie's walking a quiet beat,

32:27.032 --> 32:28.294
and suddenly he finds himself

32:28.337 --> 32:29.991
between a gun
and a cash register.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.298
There's no rigging the odds.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.822
Of course there is.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.128
It's simple logic.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.304
Not in this line of work.

32:38.347 --> 32:40.871
Your son's chosen line of work.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.352
You're actually turning me down?

32:44.919 --> 32:48.183
I am trying to think
of what's best for him.

32:50.055 --> 32:53.145
Okay. So, when you're done
thinking about it,

32:53.188 --> 32:54.842
you let me know.

32:54.885 --> 32:58.019
Until then, I would rather
you didn't contact us.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.545
I'm sorry you feel that way.

33:02.589 --> 33:05.461
I'm sorry he ever found out
about you.

33:34.577 --> 33:35.535
Police!

33:35.578 --> 33:38.190
Please help me.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.278
Please help me.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.715
Shut up!

33:41.758 --> 33:43.847
Go.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.042
What the hell are you doing,
Teddy?

33:45.066 --> 33:46.937
Don't come closer.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.003
This is not the way to get
revenge, kid, you hear me?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.158
Huh?

33:50.202 --> 33:51.159
He killed Geo.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.334
Please, he's crazy.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.336
Shut up! Shut up!

33:54.380 --> 33:58.123
Teddy! Come on, put the gun
down on the bed, all right?

33:58.166 --> 33:59.472
So nobody gets hurt.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.691
Is this the gun you used
to kill Geo?

34:01.735 --> 34:02.953
No.Huh?!

34:02.997 --> 34:04.216
Is it?!

34:04.259 --> 34:05.889
Teddy, you don't want
to do this. Come on.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.262
Help. He killed my brother.

34:07.306 --> 34:08.742
You don't know what that's like.

34:08.784 --> 34:09.917
Yes, I do.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.050
Somebody killed my brother, too.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.009
And hers.

34:16.445 --> 34:19.231
I know exactly how you feel.
Okay?

34:19.274 --> 34:20.623
Both of us do.

34:20.667 --> 34:23.713
Killing him is not gonna
make you feel any better.

34:23.757 --> 34:26.760
Let's just put the gun down
on the bed, all right?

34:26.803 --> 34:29.284
Let this scumbag spend
the rest of his life

34:29.328 --> 34:31.547
in prison,
regretting what he's done.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.636
So you don't have to.

34:37.031 --> 34:40.034
That's the way Geo
would want it.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.208
I promise you.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.697
Drop it.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.745
On the ground. On the ground.

34:55.789 --> 34:57.094
On the ground!

35:01.795 --> 35:03.231
You did the right thing.

35:20.030 --> 35:21.119
Hey.

35:23.686 --> 35:26.515
The judge is gonna let me
read Geo's testimony

35:26.559 --> 35:28.082
to the grand jury.

35:28.126 --> 35:32.042
Not the same impact
as having him there, but...

35:32.086 --> 35:33.566
it's something.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.872
And Danny said he might have
something for us tonight.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.483
Great.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.314
What's this?

35:42.357 --> 35:45.447
It's the criminal history
for Julia Kowalski.

35:45.491 --> 35:48.407
She was chargedwith possession of

35:48.450 --> 35:50.974
a forged instrument... she got a fake driver's license

35:51.018 --> 35:53.151
when she was undocumented.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.979
Since then,
she has gotten a work visa

35:56.023 --> 35:58.330
and her record is
spotless clean.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.246
In fact, the family she worked for

36:01.289 --> 36:03.726
the past five years havenothing but good things

36:03.770 --> 36:05.206
to say about her.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.469
So, why'd you look into it aftermaking such a big deal

36:07.513 --> 36:09.036
of me running her name?

36:10.516 --> 36:13.823
You accused me of playing
favoritism to my family.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.869
And maybe that's true,

36:15.912 --> 36:20.047
but you're my family, too.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.922
Thank you.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.252
I talked tothe detectives.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.645
She put him in the duffel bag,

36:52.688 --> 36:54.100
figuring she'd rather
take her chances

36:54.124 --> 36:56.692
with Child Protective Servicesfinding him a good home,

36:56.736 --> 36:59.521
rather than those lawyerswho brought her here.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.002
The lawyers that
brought her here?

37:02.045 --> 37:05.527
Yeah, two adoption lawyersrunning a baby ring.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.268
Whoa.Yeah.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.270
They were paying her $2,000
to give him up.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.229
That's it?

37:11.272 --> 37:14.710
Yeah, well, all the motherswere from poor areas,

37:14.754 --> 37:17.235
so $2,000 might as wellbe a million.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.908
Huh. Then they'd turn aroundand sell the kids

37:18.932 --> 37:20.194
for 30 to 80 grand.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.023
Wow.Mm.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.895
What's gonna happen to him now?

37:25.939 --> 37:29.072
Well, his mom is petitioningto get him back.

37:30.683 --> 37:31.814
You okay?

37:31.858 --> 37:33.903
Well, I'm happy that he gets

37:33.947 --> 37:36.515
to be with his mom.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.256
But...?

37:38.299 --> 37:41.694
There isn't really a but.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.087
I think I just...

37:44.131 --> 37:47.134
was trying to think of a...

37:47.177 --> 37:51.312
a reason for all of this, and...

37:51.356 --> 37:54.141
why you and me found him.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.538
But there isn't a reason.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.106
Yeah, there-there is... we...

38:03.150 --> 38:05.587
we saved his life.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.068
And probably others.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.944
When I told you
I didn't get attached, I lied.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.946
I know that.

38:19.340 --> 38:22.430
But I know a waythat we can get a baby

38:22.474 --> 38:24.302
that's ours to keep.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.347
Oh. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.

38:26.391 --> 38:29.045
Hmm. Oh, well, maybe this time,

38:29.089 --> 38:30.699
I get to be the hero.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.318
Before we bring the jury in,

38:40.361 --> 38:42.058
I'd like to request
an adjournment.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.756
Objection.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.235
Didn't we go through this
already?

38:45.279 --> 38:47.542
New information has cometo my attention.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.414
Sensitive information.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.154
Approach.

38:58.379 --> 38:59.728
The People have enough

38:59.772 --> 39:02.949
to tie Mr. Acosta
to the murder of Geo Valdez.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.646
We're in the middle of trial... Including

39:04.690 --> 39:06.605
two witnesses.
He's being charged with

39:06.648 --> 39:08.171
murder in the second degree.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.652
Your Honor, the People can bringcharges against Mr. Acosta

39:10.696 --> 39:12.219
when this trial is over.

39:12.262 --> 39:13.655
Why, so he cankill someone else?

39:13.699 --> 39:15.527
I'm asking for two days

39:15.570 --> 39:17.243
to bring this murder case
to the grand jury.

39:17.267 --> 39:20.358
And I ask that
Mr. Acosta be remanded.

39:22.403 --> 39:23.665
Granted.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.450
You can step back now.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.409
Juan Acosta,

39:28.453 --> 39:30.373
you're under arrestfor the murder of Geo Valdez.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.241
You stupid bitch.

39:37.244 --> 39:40.378
Looks to me like you're the onewho's got dick now.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.921
Your son is late.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.444
Well, he left his phone
in the car.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.011
There are no phones
at the table.

40:05.054 --> 40:07.753
I don't know what to say.
He likes to have it close by.

40:09.319 --> 40:10.930
Come on, Sean.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.453
Hope you got your phone on mute.

40:15.804 --> 40:18.416
Sorry I'm late, uh...

40:20.461 --> 40:22.332
We have company.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.947
Everyone, uh,
this is my cousin Joe.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.432
Um...

40:40.612 --> 40:44.180
Hi, everybody, uh...

40:55.017 --> 40:56.932

40:56.976 --> 40:59.195
Great to meet you,
Sarge. Hey, Eddie.

40:59.239 --> 41:00.936
Hey, Joe.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.504
I'm Erin.

41:03.548 --> 41:06.028
I got to ask... how'd you
get out of becoming a cop?

41:06.072 --> 41:07.639
Oh, I'm the smart one.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.597
All right.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.512
There you go.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.122
Commissioner.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.646
Just Henry.

41:14.689 --> 41:16.125
Or Pop.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.476
Welcome, Joe.

41:21.391 --> 41:23.132
Welcome.

41:23.176 --> 41:24.569
Danny Reagan.

41:24.612 --> 41:25.831
I heard about you.

41:25.874 --> 41:27.963
I trust that's it's all good.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.617
Eh.

41:29.661 --> 41:32.794
He's a Reagan.

41:34.753 --> 41:36.102
Commissioner.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.323
I hope this is okay.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.108
It's more than okay, Joe.

41:42.151 --> 41:45.503
And call me...

41:45.546 --> 41:47.940
call me whatever you want.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.421
Yes, sir.

41:51.465 --> 41:52.988
Except sir.

41:53.032 --> 41:54.555
Okay.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.167
Please.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.343
Okay.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.520
I'll take that.Thanks.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.966
Okay.

42:14.009 --> 42:17.709
Uh, Reagans say grace.

42:19.232 --> 42:20.973
So, Sean...

42:21.016 --> 42:23.497

42:24.846 --> 42:28.328
Name of the Father,
the Son, Holy Spirit.

42:28.371 --> 42:30.156
Bless us, O Lord...

42:30.199 --> 42:32.462
And these, thy gifts,
which we are about to receive

42:32.506 --> 42:36.118
from thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord. Amen.
