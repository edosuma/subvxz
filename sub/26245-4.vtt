00:12.470 --> 00:14.000
We there yet?

00:14.140 --> 00:15.339
No...

00:15.340 --> 00:17.160
you impatient cunt.

00:19.303 --> 00:21.936
So what's the surprise?

00:21.970 --> 00:24.040
Not telling.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.760
Why not?

00:27.260 --> 00:29.520
'Cause it's a fucking surprise.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.580
That's the whole point of a surprise.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.200
You don't tell the other
person 'cause then it just...

00:34.220 --> 00:37.130
it ruins the surprise.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.030
But I don't like surprises.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.230
Well, you'll fucking like this one.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.460
- Yeah, we'll see.
- You'll like this one.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.240
Yeah, we'll see.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.040
Look the other way.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.880
I didn't come out this far
for you to fuck it up.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.180
Close your eyes. Look the other way.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.280
This better be fucking
good, mate, I tell you.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.070
Just close your eyes.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.670
They're closed.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.700
Put your hands out.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.380
Get fucked.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.380
- Hey?
- Fuck off.

01:08.420 --> 01:11.340
Hey, you like surprises now, hey?

01:11.800 --> 01:14.760
- That's a Sterling.
- No, that's a Patchett.

01:16.443 --> 01:17.942
Patchett?

01:17.978 --> 01:20.178
Better than a Sterling.
Better than the Sten.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.470
Pretty much won us World War II

01:23.500 --> 01:24.976
and it'll blow your fucking head off.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.280
What are you doing with them?

01:26.360 --> 01:28.400
Gonna make some fruit salad.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.500
Stay.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.720
Stay too.

01:50.460 --> 01:51.880
You ready?

01:58.100 --> 02:00.440
This is it, mate.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.340
Merry fucking Christmas.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.846
All right, I've got another one for you.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.780
Yeah.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.160
Would you rather have
great sex or great food?

02:35.380 --> 02:37.780
- Great food.
- Oh, that's boring.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.520
Well, you gotta eat.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.300
Yeah, but if you're going
to have the great food,

02:42.320 --> 02:43.920
then you gotta have bad sex.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.210
What's bad sex?

02:45.282 --> 02:47.899
Oh, that's the sex I have with you.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.340
Oh... very funny.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.100
All right, if you're gonna
have the great food,

02:54.140 --> 02:55.419
then you've gotta have...

02:55.420 --> 02:59.040
bad sex with like some
stinky, crusty old granny.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.480
I'll have the great sex, then.

03:01.581 --> 03:04.465
Okay, but then you're
gonna have the bad food.

03:04.530 --> 03:06.180
What's bad food?

03:06.280 --> 03:08.220
I don't know. What's a
food you don't like?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.380
Sandwiches.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.900
What do you... who
doesn't like sandwiches?

03:11.920 --> 03:14.500
- I don't fucking like sandwiches.
- What do you mean?

03:14.800 --> 03:18.180
I mean, toasted's all right
but not fucking raw ones.

03:18.340 --> 03:21.060
Well, what is a raw sandwich?

03:21.120 --> 03:22.880
Well, not toasted.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.580
A bit of bread with some shit in it.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.900
Yeah, all right, fine. Okay...

03:26.970 --> 03:29.060
If you're gonna have the great sex then

03:29.080 --> 03:32.340
you have to eat raw sandwiches
for the rest of forever.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.800
How about I eat the sandwiches

03:33.820 --> 03:36.460
while I'm having the great sex?

03:36.560 --> 03:39.180
Yeah, if you want. Sure, why not?

03:39.300 --> 03:40.840
All right, I'll do that then.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.360
Won't even notice.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.160
Bobby.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.720
- How you doing?
- Hey.

04:11.868 --> 04:14.169
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good.

04:16.019 --> 04:18.740
- Ray, Davros.
- How you going, mate?

04:28.030 --> 04:30.440
So, Ray...

04:30.940 --> 04:34.220
did Freddy explain why
I wanted to see you?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.920
Yeah.

04:42.180 --> 04:44.040
So how is your friend?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.220
- He's been better.
- Yeah?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.560
Right.

04:50.180 --> 04:52.360
I heard he was in a coma.

04:55.220 --> 04:58.080
That's the way it goes, eh?
No hard feelings.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.240
Well, I'm afraid there
are hard feelings.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.700
Quite a lot of hard feelings, actually.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.720
Are there?

05:09.900 --> 05:12.240
That's why we're having this chat.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.120
You can't go around bashing my guys.

05:18.260 --> 05:21.000
But your guys can go around
bashing my friends, can they?

05:22.980 --> 05:24.800
Look, we had no idea you were friends

05:24.820 --> 05:26.400
with the guy that got bashed.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.720
I know you and Freddy are friends.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.220
And out of respect for Freddy,
my guys wouldn't have done

05:31.240 --> 05:33.020
what they did had they known.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.260
If they did...

05:36.440 --> 05:38.499
I would have put them
in the hospital myself.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.100
Did you know Freddy and I are family?

05:47.380 --> 05:49.180
He does now.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.060
He does now.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.960
Good.

05:57.060 --> 05:58.900
Well...

05:58.980 --> 06:01.260
we all know where we stand now, so...

06:01.280 --> 06:02.540
we're good.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.879
Right?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.320
Come on. Get up.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.770
Get up there.

06:22.310 --> 06:24.080
In the future...

06:24.120 --> 06:26.020
if there is a problem...

06:26.260 --> 06:28.700
you won't go off half cocked.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.140
You just keep your guys
in line, mate, okay?

06:33.200 --> 06:36.070
And then I won't have to do it for you.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.380
Nice to meet you.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.780
Jesus Christ.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.660
Don't even think about it.

06:54.140 --> 06:56.560
Trust me. Don't even think about it.

07:11.070 --> 07:12.580
Pass it to me!

07:17.120 --> 07:19.020
Go, go, go. Keep it moving.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.200
Come out, come out.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.520
Bella, Bella, over here.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.440
Hey, Britt. Brittany.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.380
Corey.

07:53.020 --> 07:54.650
But even though there are lots

07:54.700 --> 07:56.920
of different types of stag beetles,

07:56.940 --> 07:59.840
many are facing a loss of
habitat that is threatening...

07:59.860 --> 08:01.570
- What's that?
- Bug Versus Bug.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.980
I'm obsessed with it.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.959
Last night they had two spiders.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.176
They had this like, jumping spider

08:07.200 --> 08:08.640
and this spitting spider.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.759
And the jumping spider, he
attacks the other one...

08:10.760 --> 08:12.520
- and jumps on him, but he misses.
- Mm.

08:12.530 --> 08:13.530
And the spitting spider,

08:13.540 --> 08:15.780
he then shoots out this kind of like...

08:15.840 --> 08:17.760
What are these idiots doing?

08:19.740 --> 08:21.640
Having a good old fucking chit-chat.

08:32.570 --> 08:35.780
Oh, fuck, here we go.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.676
- What's your problem, dick head?
- What's my problem...

08:37.700 --> 08:39.155
- Ah!
- I'll fucking give you one of those,

08:39.179 --> 08:40.799
- you fucking little turd.
- Ray!

08:40.799 --> 08:43.600
Yeah, you better run,
you fucking cocksucker.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.440
Hey? Hey?

08:46.470 --> 08:48.320
Ah!

08:53.260 --> 08:56.360
Yeah, fucking run, you little bitch.

09:05.660 --> 09:08.620
- What?
- What the fuck?

09:08.710 --> 09:10.720
Just get in the car, love. Get in.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.540
You want a cuppa?

09:28.640 --> 09:30.420
Uh, yeah, sure.

09:38.220 --> 09:40.460
Hey, can we talk?

09:40.910 --> 09:42.580
Yeah, what's up?

09:43.980 --> 09:47.000
What happened today with those guys...

09:50.140 --> 09:53.720
it's kind of really bothering me.

09:53.777 --> 09:55.057
Mm.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.280
Um...

09:58.320 --> 10:01.400
I mean, I know they were
being assholes but...

10:02.500 --> 10:04.400
Mm.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.830
Like, you were really violent...

10:06.870 --> 10:08.620
and it bothers me.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.380
What was I supposed to do?

10:12.420 --> 10:14.109
I just...

10:14.110 --> 10:16.660
feel like you could have...

10:16.840 --> 10:18.900
you could have at least
tried to talk to the guy,

10:18.920 --> 10:20.220
you know?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.060
Maybe tried to...

10:22.105 --> 10:23.938
defuse the situation.

10:24.070 --> 10:26.020
Yeah.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.370
That would have given his partner

10:28.380 --> 10:30.100
time to get out of the car.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.360
And then I'm dealing with two
assholes instead of one.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.760
I mean, one on one...

10:37.040 --> 10:39.860
yeah, sure. But, uh...

10:40.540 --> 10:43.240
two on one, it's just too risky.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.840
And you were there, I don't
want you getting hurt, so...

10:50.100 --> 10:51.840
Sure. Right, yeah.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.840
Okay?

10:56.673 --> 10:58.640
Yep.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.020
Yeah, well, thank you, Max. Thank you.

11:04.047 --> 11:05.546
Um...

11:05.615 --> 11:07.081
Ray.

11:07.110 --> 11:08.899
How many, uh...

11:08.900 --> 11:10.670
how many people, if you had to guess,

11:10.700 --> 11:13.440
how many people would you
say that you've assaulted?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.760
Heaps.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.120
And how do you feel about that?

11:18.920 --> 11:21.000
Fine. They had it coming, so...

11:21.114 --> 11:23.047
And what did they do?

11:23.116 --> 11:26.333
Oh, it depends. Uh...

11:26.360 --> 11:30.220
I mean, I'm pretty big
on, just respect, so...

11:30.300 --> 11:33.540
like, if you respect me, I respect you.

11:33.700 --> 11:36.980
You know, if you don't,
we got a problem.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.900
Well, let's talk about
the most recent assault.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.520
The one with the two youths.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.635
No, well, I only bashed one of them...

11:44.770 --> 11:45.860
and um...

11:45.900 --> 11:49.180
they weren't youths. They
were, like, in their 20s.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.760
Well, let's call them young men then.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.160
Ah, yeah, so...

11:54.180 --> 11:57.480
I was walking down the street
with me daughter and...

11:57.740 --> 12:00.660
these two guys come
along, bumped into her,

12:00.800 --> 12:03.340
and she had an ice cream, and...

12:03.400 --> 12:05.400
you know, dropped her ice cream and...

12:05.408 --> 12:07.942
So you assaulted him?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.100
Well...

12:10.160 --> 12:12.610
no, they started... then
they started swearing...

12:12.680 --> 12:15.120
and she's only eight, so...

12:15.300 --> 12:18.260
So you bashed him...

12:18.320 --> 12:20.980
while your daughter was
just standing there?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.899
No, not while she was standing there.

12:22.900 --> 12:24.780
I bashed him later.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.760
Okay, well, how did you feel afterwards?

12:27.820 --> 12:29.780
After it was... after it all happened?

12:29.800 --> 12:31.000
Fine.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.880
Do you enjoy hitting people?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.080
I wouldn't say I enjoy hitting people.

12:40.070 --> 12:41.700
You know, if I hit somebody

12:41.720 --> 12:43.644
I generally got a pretty good reason.

12:43.780 --> 12:45.500
And you think you had a good reason?

12:45.540 --> 12:47.460
Didn't I just say that?

12:47.760 --> 12:50.780
So can you remind me again
what that reason was?

12:51.080 --> 12:53.760
Well, they were being assholes.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.585
The world is full of assholes, Ray,

12:56.600 --> 12:58.280
you do realize that?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.640
Yeah and you know why?

13:00.880 --> 13:02.940
Why?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.320
'Cause people let them get away with it.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.520
See, if you were in jail, right?

13:08.560 --> 13:10.099
And you fucked with somebody,

13:10.100 --> 13:11.641
you disrespect somebody,

13:11.642 --> 13:13.600
you can end up dead.

13:13.870 --> 13:15.200
There's consequences.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.310
But out here in the real world...

13:17.447 --> 13:19.046
There's no consequences.

13:19.180 --> 13:21.020
Right?

13:21.780 --> 13:24.016
So next time these two pricks
are walking down the street

13:24.040 --> 13:25.570
and they start thinking,
"Oh, we might go

13:25.580 --> 13:26.820
and fuck with somebody."

13:26.880 --> 13:29.100
They're gonna think twice about it...

13:29.140 --> 13:31.680
which is good for everybody.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.740
So in your mind...

13:33.880 --> 13:35.480
you've done society a favor.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.433
Yeah.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.880
Well, I guess on behalf of society,

13:42.900 --> 13:44.300
I should say thank you.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.959
Steve, how are, uh...

13:50.960 --> 13:54.220
how're things at home
since we last spoke?

14:15.100 --> 14:17.430
- Here you go.
- It's about time.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.200
Nice to meet you too.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.500
Your dad tells me you're
a bit of a legend

14:38.520 --> 14:40.610
- on the netball court.
- I'm okay.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.120
Okay? I'm sure you're better than okay.

14:43.180 --> 14:44.599
Do you wanna come see my room?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.360
Sure, I'd love to. Lead the way.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.636
- It's over here.
- Okay.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.120
Top shelf.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.820
How'd she end up with you?

14:56.660 --> 14:59.680
- She must be desperate.
- Mm-hmm.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.620
- Did you do that?
- Yeah.

15:02.780 --> 15:05.080
That is awesome.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.520
- This is Patrick.
- Oh, hello, Patrick.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.380
Oh, he's got a lovely mane.
He's very beautiful.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.040
Are you gonna marry my dad?

15:17.580 --> 15:19.680
Um...

15:20.860 --> 15:22.220
Uh...

15:22.370 --> 15:25.960
Do you know what?
Actually, I don't know.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.600
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:27.610 --> 15:30.780
Did you know that my dad's
seen a real unicorn before?

15:30.940 --> 15:32.780
- Has he?
- Mm-hmm.

15:32.860 --> 15:35.480
He said he saw it in the Blue Mountains.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.060
Okay. Wow.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.280
We're gonna go to look for one.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.820
Right.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.160
Do you wanna come?

15:43.320 --> 15:45.960
Yes, I would love to come.
That would be great.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.180
Okay, cool.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.680
Okay, cool.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.920
Where have you been?

22:02.270 --> 22:04.340
Run out of smokes.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.420
Mm.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.700
What's that smell?

22:11.400 --> 22:12.780
What smell?

22:12.900 --> 22:15.400
I don't know, it's like a...

22:16.020 --> 22:18.820
it's like a burning sort of...

22:18.900 --> 22:22.500
chemically sort of smell.
