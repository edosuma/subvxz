00:08.276 --> 00:10.410
What about that panelist
that proposed an amplified

00:10.478 --> 00:12.813
DoS Storm attack on the
stock market servers?

00:12.880 --> 00:13.947
This is terrifying.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.516
At least the half that I understood.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.303
You know, I'm just glad
that these scenarios

00:17.318 --> 00:18.719
- are hypothetical.
- Wait, hold up.

00:18.787 --> 00:20.554
What happened to my
conspiracy-minded buddy?

00:20.622 --> 00:22.556
Our government is sitting
on those same weapons

00:22.557 --> 00:24.877
- right now, just itching to use them.
- Yeah, well, if they are,

00:24.878 --> 00:26.279
then I don't want to know about it.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.887
You know, it's the stuff of nightmares.

00:27.888 --> 00:29.188
Well, you know what?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.197
Let's see which panelist

00:30.265 --> 00:31.965
is gonna keep you up all night next.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.800
- Help!
- Come on, let's go!

00:33.868 --> 00:35.602
Patton, call 911.

00:35.670 --> 00:36.937
I'm on it.

00:37.005 --> 00:38.939
- Hey!
- Shut up!

00:39.007 --> 00:41.542
Help!

00:41.609 --> 00:42.876
Help me!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.649
Let me go!

00:48.716 --> 00:50.284
- No!
- Get in!

00:51.953 --> 00:53.554
Let's go.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.495
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

01:01.563 --> 01:04.131
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪

01:04.199 --> 01:06.567
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

01:06.634 --> 01:07.801
♪ How, how, how, how ♪

01:07.869 --> 01:09.570
♪ Hey, hey ♪

01:16.044 --> 01:17.077
♪ You gotta come on. ♪

01:20.315 --> 01:22.082
Hey, Carter?

01:22.149 --> 01:23.784
You in there?

01:23.851 --> 01:25.719
Come on, I'm double-parked.

01:26.988 --> 01:28.121
Oh.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.090
Uh, sorry.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.692
Wrong apartment?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.327
No, you're here for Quentin, right?

01:33.394 --> 01:35.262
- Yeah.
- Come on in. He's almost ready.

01:35.330 --> 01:37.097
- Oh.
- Do you want some coffee?

01:37.165 --> 01:39.032
Um, no. No, thank you.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.701
Okay.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.006
Uh, I'm Hannah, Quentin's associate.

01:46.074 --> 01:48.275
Audrey, Quentin's friend.

01:48.343 --> 01:49.863
- Ever heard of texting?
- Yeah, I did.

01:49.864 --> 01:51.645
- You didn't respond.
- Oh, he's bad at that.

01:51.713 --> 01:54.214
Well, you could've just gone.
I would've met you there.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.483
Yeah, well, we... we got
a crime scene to work.

01:56.551 --> 01:58.652
Thought it'd be easier with one car.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.388
- Okay. Well, let's go.
- Okay.

02:01.456 --> 02:03.724
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.229
What's that look?

02:10.298 --> 02:12.032
- No look.
- I can feel it.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.800
I know you got a ton of questions.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.069
I am just walking to the elevator.

02:17.105 --> 02:18.739
She's a friend.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.007
How's that?

02:20.074 --> 02:22.376
Audrey.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.710
She's just a friend.

02:24.746 --> 02:26.380
Nice to have friends.

02:29.751 --> 02:31.752
It wasn't so much the
suspects fighting back

02:31.819 --> 02:34.554
as it was the set of
stairs I was hurled down.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.524
Yeah. Well, could've been
a hell of a lot worse.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.660
Glad you're okay.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.561
What about the victim?

02:41.629 --> 02:46.233
Well, witnesses were able to
ID her as Ms. Norah Moncado.

02:46.301 --> 02:48.335
She's here attending
the security conference.

02:48.403 --> 02:49.903
FBI's on this one?

02:49.971 --> 02:51.238
Hannah and Carter are with them

02:51.306 --> 02:52.572
- at the crime scene.
- Okay.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.508
Well, I just need to check out

02:54.575 --> 02:56.443
the security and traffic
cam footage ASAP.

02:56.511 --> 02:57.944
If you get my laptop, I'll, um...

02:58.012 --> 02:59.546
Do absolutely nothing.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.415
What? I'm fine. It's just, you know...

03:01.442 --> 03:02.962
Three broken ribs, multiple contusions

03:02.963 --> 03:04.117
and a sprained wrist.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.385
Loretta's right.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.054
You need to focus on recovering.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.022
And I found the perfect medicine.

03:09.090 --> 03:11.258
Are those the lime ones?
Where'd you get all those?

03:11.326 --> 03:13.126
A lady never tells.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.128
Oh, I could get used to Nurse Tammy.

03:15.156 --> 03:16.396
I take it back. I take it back.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.931
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.439
Looks like you're in good hands here,

03:19.440 --> 03:20.734
Sebastian, with these two.

03:20.762 --> 03:22.362
I'm gonna check in on Hannah and Carter.

03:22.363 --> 03:23.904
Okay.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.305
This is all you could find, huh?

03:30.712 --> 03:31.745
Hey.

03:31.813 --> 03:33.213
Hey. How's Sebastian?

03:33.281 --> 03:35.382
Well, he's gonna be all right.

03:35.450 --> 03:37.570
The doctors want to keep
him overnight for monitoring.

03:37.571 --> 03:39.419
Too bad his beatdown didn't get us more

03:39.487 --> 03:41.321
than a kidnapper's glove.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.224
Uh, he misses you, too, Carter.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.460
What do you have on
our kidnapping victim?

03:46.527 --> 03:48.729
Norah Moncado, 35.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.297
Single, no children.

03:50.365 --> 03:52.833
Resides in Baltimore and came
to town for the conference

03:52.900 --> 03:55.602
on behalf of her current
employer, Spotter Security.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.171
She, uh, contracts in I.T.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.907
Helps tech companies
square away security.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.776
Network encryption, data breaches.

04:02.844 --> 04:04.511
Nothing classified or sensitive enough

04:04.579 --> 04:06.113
to make her a kidnapping target.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.614
What about ransom?

04:07.682 --> 04:09.449
There's been no calls, no demands yet.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.017
Plus, no one to call. Only child.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.286
Parents died in a car wreck
when she was in college.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.521
She's got a clean record.

04:14.589 --> 04:16.322
Pays her taxes, solid credit score.

04:16.391 --> 04:17.858
Few thousand in savings.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.358
And has a social media footprint

04:19.387 --> 04:20.906
dedicated to her succulent collection.

04:20.908 --> 04:22.195
Perfectly normal.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.131
Except...

04:24.198 --> 04:26.133
normal people don't get kidnapped.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.368
We used the security
footage from the plaza

04:28.436 --> 04:31.204
to try to track the van,
but her abductors

04:31.272 --> 04:34.141
planned a getaway route that
avoided security cameras.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.843
- This was a brazen, public spectacle.
- Mm-hmm.

04:36.911 --> 04:38.545
Kidnappers aren't gonna take that risk

04:38.613 --> 04:40.313
unless Norah is important.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.215
We're missing something about her.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.684
Everyone has secrets.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.487
We just need to figure
out what hers are.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.890
She was staying at an
Airbnb in the Garden District.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.158
We'll check it out.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.559
And I'll check in with Patton,

04:52.627 --> 04:55.195
see if he's found any
cracks in her story.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.665
- Patton?
- Man, you trying

04:58.733 --> 05:00.834
- to give me a heart attack.
- You okay?

05:00.902 --> 05:02.536
I watched Sebastian
take that spill, man.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.037
- Set me on edge.
- Hey.

05:04.105 --> 05:05.806
He's gonna be okay, P.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.074
But with him riding the bench...

05:08.142 --> 05:10.462
You're gonna need me to step
my game up. I'm already on it.

05:10.463 --> 05:11.474
Our victim Norah...

05:11.476 --> 05:12.485
she's damn sure more

05:12.547 --> 05:14.381
than some ordinary I.T. consultant.

05:15.597 --> 05:16.917
She worked for multiple companies

05:16.918 --> 05:18.218
over the past ten years.

05:18.286 --> 05:20.320
Now, by themselves, none seem special.

05:20.388 --> 05:23.390
- But combined?
- There's a common denominator.

05:23.458 --> 05:24.591
Presidium Limited.

05:24.659 --> 05:26.026
Each company receives

05:26.093 --> 05:28.328
a generous investment from Presidium.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.664
Then the next week, they
get a new contractor.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.199
Norah.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.733
What's Presidium?

05:33.801 --> 05:35.735
You tell me.

05:35.803 --> 05:39.506
Investment deposits come
from an offshore bank account.

05:39.574 --> 05:41.374
No physical address, no real owner.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.276
A shell corporation.

05:43.344 --> 05:47.447
But why bribe these
companies to hire Norah?

05:47.515 --> 05:48.748
I don't know.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.584
Uh, the work she did seems to be legit,

05:50.651 --> 05:51.852
but I'm gonna keep digging.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.386
Yeah, well, I feel like I know

05:53.454 --> 05:55.355
less about Norah than
when I walked in here.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.857
Yeah, well, I'll tell you this...

05:56.884 --> 05:58.364
she writes some pretty angsty poetry.

05:58.365 --> 05:59.593
I found this train wreck

05:59.660 --> 06:01.761
saved as a draft in an e-mail account.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.531
"You left a void around me,

06:04.599 --> 06:06.933
"darkness, black.

06:07.001 --> 06:11.204
You fled and now I'm
nothing, weightless, slack".

06:11.272 --> 06:12.272
"Slack"?

06:12.340 --> 06:14.040
Girl needs to find a better way

06:14.108 --> 06:15.976
to deal with her breakups,
'cause these words

06:16.043 --> 06:17.477
ain't winning anyone over.

06:20.515 --> 06:23.075
So, how long you planning on
living in corporate housing?

06:23.143 --> 06:24.610
Uh, my record is 13 months.

06:24.678 --> 06:25.785
That was Sicily.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.233
Usually, it's 8 to 11 months

06:27.254 --> 06:28.455
before I move on to a new gig.

06:28.523 --> 06:30.390
You're just comfortable
with temporary living?

06:30.391 --> 06:31.658
Yeah, five posts in five years.

06:31.726 --> 06:33.059
Before that, I was a Marine.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.494
Before that, Navy brat.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.396
So, yeah, I like the nomad life.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.731
Yeah, I thought I did, too.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.478
Living out of a suitcase,
seeing the world.

06:39.479 --> 06:41.167
I really didn't know what I was missing

06:41.235 --> 06:44.404
until I got a bed, hung up some photos.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.806
A bed is a bed. Photos,
I keep on my phone.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.776
As long as it's clean and I
got a place to hang my suits,

06:49.844 --> 06:51.111
I'm good.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.580
Property owner texted me the code.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.659
I'll cover the rear.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.407
Federal agent!

07:21.509 --> 07:23.009
You need to put that down.

07:24.679 --> 07:27.314
Hey, I'd listen to her if I were you.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.915
Maybe you should listen to us.

07:30.685 --> 07:32.519
We're NCIS. Who are you?

07:32.587 --> 07:36.289
We're the ones with more
guns, so drop yours.

07:36.357 --> 07:37.757
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.329
I think we have a big problem.

07:42.396 --> 07:43.863
I'll make it go away.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.298
Winchester?

07:45.366 --> 07:48.001
Special Agent Khoury.

07:48.069 --> 07:50.570
Why am I not surprised?

07:56.243 --> 07:58.144
What the hell is DIA doing here?

08:05.448 --> 08:07.549
Oh. You think you brought enough guys?

08:10.953 --> 08:12.220
I know what you're gonna ask.

08:12.288 --> 08:13.768
Why is DIA taking over the kidnapping

08:13.789 --> 08:15.123
of an I.T. consultant?

08:15.191 --> 08:16.625
And you know what I'm gonna answer.

08:16.692 --> 08:18.293
"Above my paygrade. National security".

08:18.361 --> 08:20.930
You ever get tired of asking
questions you know the answers to?

08:20.932 --> 08:23.233
You ever get tired of using
the same crappy lines?

08:23.299 --> 08:26.067
I do not.

08:26.135 --> 08:27.569
Pack up the rest of the house.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.971
We'll take it into evidence.

08:30.039 --> 08:32.340
One of my agents was hospitalized

08:32.408 --> 08:33.875
trying to save Norah Moncado.

08:33.943 --> 08:36.177
Special Agent Lund hurt
his ribs and his pride.

08:36.245 --> 08:37.912
Both will be fine.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.315
But my team is best suited
for tracking Norah down.

08:40.383 --> 08:43.018
Oh, I think we're doing fine
without the benefit of you.

08:43.085 --> 08:46.221
You made it all the way to
her Airbnb... hours after us.

08:46.288 --> 08:48.323
Congratulations.

08:48.391 --> 08:50.258
If this is your case, it's your case,

08:50.326 --> 08:51.860
but I got to know:

08:51.927 --> 08:54.663
What is DIA's interest in Norah Moncado?

08:56.132 --> 08:58.433
Learn to live with disappointment.

08:58.501 --> 09:00.769
The shell corporation.

09:00.836 --> 09:02.837
Presidium... it's DIA cover.

09:02.905 --> 09:05.607
You got Norah each one
of those contracting jobs.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.342
She's one of yours.

09:11.447 --> 09:13.181
This isn't over.

09:13.249 --> 09:15.884
This is absolutely over.

09:15.951 --> 09:20.021
Whether we like it or
not, DIA has jurisdiction.

09:20.089 --> 09:21.890
Who is this Winchester guy anyway?

09:21.957 --> 09:23.425
He's the ultimate swooper.

09:23.492 --> 09:26.027
He swoops in at the last
minute, takes all the credit.

09:26.095 --> 09:28.463
Kicked us off of a killer
drone operation last year

09:28.531 --> 09:31.366
and expected everyone to pretend
like none of it ever happened.

09:31.434 --> 09:33.601
Seemed like you two have some history.

09:33.669 --> 09:36.104
Yeah, our first run-in was
in North Africa years ago.

09:36.172 --> 09:38.807
My team spent six
months gathering intel.

09:38.874 --> 09:40.408
Winchester came in...

09:40.476 --> 09:42.210
Came in, took all the glory for himself?

09:42.278 --> 09:44.145
- Swooper.
- Not this time.

09:44.213 --> 09:46.247
Sebastian was injured.

09:46.315 --> 09:48.249
We need to find out who was responsible.

09:48.317 --> 09:50.251
Sebastian's gonna be just fine.

09:50.319 --> 09:52.087
Yeah, maybe a few Jell-O pounds heavier.

09:52.154 --> 09:55.924
This isn't worth getting into
a bureaucratic fight over.

09:55.991 --> 09:57.826
The last thing we need is to bring

09:57.893 --> 10:01.429
the NCIS brass down on our heads again.

10:01.497 --> 10:03.231
Wait, how'd I manage
to piss off HQ already?

10:03.299 --> 10:04.332
I just got here.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.367
He's not talking about you.

10:15.544 --> 10:16.745
Hannah.

10:17.813 --> 10:19.114
Just tell me.

10:19.181 --> 10:20.582
Are you being cautious because

10:20.609 --> 10:22.169
you're anticipating problems from D.C.,

10:22.170 --> 10:23.810
or do you know that
something's happening?

10:24.754 --> 10:26.454
Deputy Director Van Cleef.

10:26.522 --> 10:28.590
Yeah, he had me
demoted for making a call.

10:28.657 --> 10:30.158
I took my lumps.

10:30.226 --> 10:31.960
It's been months... not a peep.

10:32.027 --> 10:33.695
He's leaving NCIS.

10:36.665 --> 10:38.299
Well, that should be good news.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.835
Yeah.

10:40.903 --> 10:43.671
But guys like him make grand gestures

10:43.739 --> 10:45.206
before they take a bow.

10:50.079 --> 10:52.213
You think he's gonna come after me?

10:52.281 --> 10:55.350
Don't know.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.185
But why borrow trouble?

10:57.253 --> 11:00.722
I don't need you to protect me.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.158
You also don't need to go against DIA.

11:03.225 --> 11:05.460
Both can be true.

11:05.528 --> 11:08.263
Let 'em find their own damn agent.

11:27.449 --> 11:29.083
Show me your hands!

11:29.151 --> 11:31.986
If I stop stirring,
I'll burn the risotto.

11:36.425 --> 11:37.659
You're still here.

11:37.726 --> 11:39.928
Ooh, you could sound happier about it.

11:39.995 --> 11:41.763
Oh, uh...

11:41.831 --> 11:43.031
where did you find that thing?

11:43.098 --> 11:45.066
Oh, this? I found this in a drawer.

11:45.134 --> 11:47.068
It doesn't seem like
quite your style, but...

11:47.136 --> 11:49.704
- I make it look good.
- Ooh.

11:49.772 --> 11:52.006
Well, I will not disagree with you.

11:52.074 --> 11:53.408
Get a plate. Food's ready.

11:53.475 --> 11:55.610
Not that I don't appreciate
a home-cooked meal,

11:55.678 --> 11:57.745
but I thought you were flying out today.

11:57.813 --> 11:59.714
I pushed my flight till tomorrow.

11:59.782 --> 12:03.017
After all, I came here for one reason,

12:03.085 --> 12:07.021
and that reason rudely
disappeared on me this morning.

12:07.089 --> 12:08.523
You know I'm always on call.

12:08.591 --> 12:09.891
No, I don't want an apology.

12:09.959 --> 12:11.893
I just want what I came here for.

12:11.961 --> 12:13.962
And what did you come here for?

12:14.029 --> 12:16.030
It's not the risotto.

12:23.372 --> 12:24.606
- Winchester?
- Yeah.

12:24.673 --> 12:26.374
The same guy who came
in and stole my drone

12:26.442 --> 12:27.675
- Mm-hmm.
- ...like a bastard?

12:27.743 --> 12:29.477
Swooper strikes again.

12:29.545 --> 12:31.185
- Well, what'd he want with Norah?
- Well,

12:31.186 --> 12:33.548
turns out she's an undercover DIA agent.

12:33.616 --> 12:35.450
Hey. You're gonna get sick eating that.

12:35.517 --> 12:37.485
Why are you eating so many?

12:37.553 --> 12:39.053
Norah's DIA?

12:39.121 --> 12:40.622
Yeah. That's why she was a target.

12:40.649 --> 12:42.849
Well, that doesn't make any
sense... when she was taken,

12:42.850 --> 12:45.059
- she screamed, like, a lot.
- Yeah, you did say

12:45.127 --> 12:46.528
she had a healthy set of lungs.

12:46.595 --> 12:47.729
Yeah, she didn't fight back.

12:47.797 --> 12:49.697
That's weird, right? You'd
think a trained agent

12:49.698 --> 12:51.432
would at least put up
some kind of a fight.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.834
Why didn't you say this before?

12:52.902 --> 12:54.622
Well, it wasn't relevant
when I thought that

12:54.623 --> 12:56.738
she was a civilian, but now
that I know she's DIA...

12:56.805 --> 12:57.972
Oh, my God.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.920
All right, let me think
about this for a second.

12:59.921 --> 13:01.276
Let me get my thoughts together.

13:01.343 --> 13:03.745
Whoa! I don't need to see that.
Where you going, tiny butt?

13:03.812 --> 13:05.452
- I got to get released.
- Get in the bed.

13:05.453 --> 13:07.115
- No, I got to go.
- Get it in the bed.

13:07.182 --> 13:08.449
In the bed.

13:08.517 --> 13:10.118
Now, tell me

13:10.185 --> 13:12.387
what you're thinking so I can help.

13:15.090 --> 13:17.525
Ah...

13:17.593 --> 13:20.361
Canceling your flight
to stay another night?

13:20.429 --> 13:23.097
Mm-mm, sorry. Just finished checking in.

13:23.165 --> 13:24.332
Mm.

13:25.668 --> 13:27.201
Mm. I'm glad you stayed.

13:27.269 --> 13:29.537
I'm glad your coworker
didn't interrupt us again.

13:31.373 --> 13:33.374
Khoury, she can be a little, um...

13:33.442 --> 13:35.977
- impatient.
- Mm.

13:36.045 --> 13:37.612
But she's had a rough year.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.015
Now, how would Agent "I Don't Get Close
to My Coworkers" Carter know that?

13:41.083 --> 13:43.318
Because I do my homework.

13:43.385 --> 13:45.520
Mm-hmm. What happened to her?

13:45.587 --> 13:47.749
Well, she used to run the
team, then she got demoted.

13:47.751 --> 13:48.791
I'm not really sure why.

13:48.857 --> 13:51.337
- Well, that's got to hurt.
- Yeah, but she's handling it well.

13:51.338 --> 13:54.062
- Have you ever told her that?
- No.

13:54.129 --> 13:56.297
Like you said, I don't get
close to my coworkers.

13:56.365 --> 13:59.085
Paying someone a compliment is not
the same as getting close to them.

13:59.101 --> 14:00.468
No, I'm not opening that door.

14:00.536 --> 14:02.370
Yeah, you say something nice to them,

14:02.438 --> 14:03.972
then they say something nice back...

14:04.039 --> 14:05.873
- Well, it's a vicious cycle.
- It is.

14:05.941 --> 14:07.573
And then they start
asking you questions,

14:07.575 --> 14:09.244
like, "Who's that girl
in your apartment?"

14:09.311 --> 14:11.579
- Oh. And you said?
- Nothing.

14:12.781 --> 14:14.141
My relationship with my girlfriend

14:14.142 --> 14:15.509
is none of her business.

14:16.585 --> 14:17.652
Mm.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.524
Well, speak of the devil.

14:23.592 --> 14:25.360
Duty calls.

14:25.427 --> 14:27.895
We still good for, uh, next month?

14:27.963 --> 14:29.330
Meet halfway in Denver?

14:29.398 --> 14:30.999
Uh, I'm not sure.

14:31.066 --> 14:32.967
I'll make the wait worth it.

14:34.336 --> 14:36.404
I promise.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.682
I told you the kidnapping
of Agent Moncado

14:47.750 --> 14:49.417
isn't our case anymore.

14:49.485 --> 14:51.925
His ribs are broken, but his
brain is fine. Just hear him out.

14:51.987 --> 14:53.621
All right, so-so Norah
didn't fight back.

14:53.622 --> 14:55.422
Tell me you don't think
that's a little weird.

14:55.423 --> 14:57.324
Sebastian, I already combed
through the footage.

14:57.392 --> 14:59.060
There's nothing useful from the attack.

14:59.128 --> 15:00.968
Yeah, well, I'm not
interested in what happened

15:00.996 --> 15:03.036
during the attack... I'm
interested in what happened

15:03.037 --> 15:04.599
a few hours prior to the attack.

15:04.666 --> 15:06.901
Isn't that the exact location

15:06.969 --> 15:08.803
- where she was later kidnapped?
- Yeah,

15:08.871 --> 15:11.372
and that's not all... check
out her line of sight.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.207
Oh, snap!

15:13.275 --> 15:15.209
She's looking at the kidnappers' van.

15:15.277 --> 15:16.578
Any chance that's a coincidence?

15:16.645 --> 15:18.853
Would be if she didn't do the
same thing the day before.

15:18.855 --> 15:21.115
She picked out the very
spot that she was gonna

15:21.183 --> 15:22.483
be kidnapped from.

15:22.551 --> 15:24.719
Because she was in on it.

15:24.787 --> 15:26.821
I got to fill Winchester in.

15:26.889 --> 15:28.589
Look, if she staged her own kidnapping,

15:28.657 --> 15:30.758
what else is she planning
right under his nose?

15:30.813 --> 15:32.293
Damn, it went straight to voice mail.

15:32.294 --> 15:34.228
- Can you locate his phone?
- Aw, man.

15:34.296 --> 15:37.398
Even I can't break the
DIA's level of encryption.

15:37.466 --> 15:39.801
But their phones transmit data

15:39.868 --> 15:42.370
on the same cell network
that we use, too.

15:42.438 --> 15:43.861
Then you just got to find the tower

15:43.862 --> 15:45.422
that's receiving the encrypted signals.

15:45.423 --> 15:47.141
I can narrow it down
to a two-mile radius.

15:47.209 --> 15:49.277
Can you be more specific, please?

15:49.344 --> 15:52.346
His SUV. The DIA, they're always
concerned about their phones,

15:52.414 --> 15:55.083
but they forget they're
driving a computer on wheels.

15:57.052 --> 16:00.288
American-made black SUV.
Well, there's hundreds of those

16:00.355 --> 16:01.756
- in the city.
- Yeah.

16:01.824 --> 16:03.758
Yeah, we don't need to
search the whole city.

16:03.826 --> 16:06.594
Just a two-mile area that's
receiving encrypted signals.

16:06.662 --> 16:07.929
I'll take those odds.

16:11.799 --> 16:13.400
I want a clean breach.

16:13.468 --> 16:14.869
We extract our girl,

16:14.937 --> 16:17.505
take down anyone who
tries to stop us. Copy?

16:17.573 --> 16:19.340
Copy. In position.

16:19.408 --> 16:21.676
- Stand by.
- Winchester.

16:21.744 --> 16:22.746
What are you doing here?

16:22.748 --> 16:24.513
Trying to save you
from making a mistake.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.681
Norah is working with the kidnappers.

16:26.748 --> 16:28.116
It's all a setup.

16:28.183 --> 16:30.585
Does this look like someone
who's in on her own kidnapping?

16:30.653 --> 16:32.020
Maybe it's Norah, maybe it isn't.

16:32.021 --> 16:33.554
Look, either way, you should know more

16:33.555 --> 16:34.589
- before you charge in.
- There's no time.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.157
We found a second pair of tire tracks.

16:36.158 --> 16:37.638
The kidnappers aren't here right now,

16:37.666 --> 16:39.026
but they could be back any minute.

16:39.027 --> 16:40.401
- Why would they...
- Enough!

16:40.429 --> 16:43.264
You've lost control of your team.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.401
Hey, does this look off

16:47.469 --> 16:50.671
- to you?
- Yeah, it looks patchy.

16:50.739 --> 16:53.241
- What would cause that?
- I've seen it before, overseas.

16:53.308 --> 16:55.188
Terrorists would pack a
corpse with body warmers

16:55.189 --> 16:56.410
so we'd pick it up.

16:56.478 --> 16:58.012
Draw the cavalry in.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.381
Hey!

17:00.449 --> 17:02.183
Winchester, it's a trap!

17:02.251 --> 17:04.585
Whoever's tied up in
there is already dead!

17:04.653 --> 17:06.186
They're being used as...

17:06.255 --> 17:07.320
Secure the perimeter.

17:07.388 --> 17:09.423
- Yes, sir.
- Winchester, stop.

17:09.491 --> 17:11.192
This is my operation, Pride.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.060
I'm getting my agent out.

17:13.127 --> 17:15.596
Even if it means risking the lives

17:15.664 --> 17:17.665
of the rest of your men?

17:30.412 --> 17:31.445
Stand down.

17:31.513 --> 17:32.780
Fall back!

17:55.393 --> 17:56.727
How's my team?

17:56.795 --> 17:58.228
Several are headed to the hospital.

17:58.296 --> 17:59.496
But they'll live, so will you,

17:59.564 --> 18:01.065
thanks to Special Agent Khoury.

18:01.132 --> 18:03.172
You need to tell us
everything we don't know

18:03.173 --> 18:04.201
about Norah Moncado.

18:04.269 --> 18:05.836
I'm good.

18:07.739 --> 18:09.540
She's dead.

18:09.607 --> 18:11.108
We don't know that.

18:11.176 --> 18:13.210
Regardless, the case isn't dead.

18:13.278 --> 18:15.446
Norah had access to
classified DIA intelligence,

18:15.513 --> 18:16.680
didn't she?

18:16.748 --> 18:18.215
She had something

18:18.283 --> 18:19.783
of value to exchange.

18:19.851 --> 18:22.686
Whatever it is, DIA would hate
for it to be in enemy hands.

18:22.754 --> 18:26.090
I taught her everything there
was to know about deception.

18:26.157 --> 18:27.791
She used it against me.

18:27.859 --> 18:29.727
Aw, save the pity party.

18:29.794 --> 18:31.228
Read us in,

18:31.296 --> 18:33.197
or explain to DoD that
you let a double agent

18:33.264 --> 18:35.799
hand over God knows
what intel to an enemy.

18:40.005 --> 18:42.106
Look, what I'm about to tell you

18:42.173 --> 18:45.242
will be denied if it comes out later.

18:45.310 --> 18:49.046
My role at DIA is Head
of Internal Security.

18:49.114 --> 18:51.048
So, basically, the most secretive agent

18:51.116 --> 18:53.384
at the nation's most secretive agency.

18:53.451 --> 18:55.953
I handle clearances and
vetting to find the right people

18:56.021 --> 18:58.222
to do the most demanding of jobs.

18:58.289 --> 18:59.990
I also handle leaks.

19:00.058 --> 19:01.325
And Norah Moncado?

19:02.527 --> 19:04.928
Real name's Norah Bishop.

19:04.996 --> 19:07.431
She was my human lie detector.

19:07.499 --> 19:11.101
She could sniff out anyone
unfit to work at the agency.

19:11.169 --> 19:12.449
That's why you set up Presidium.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.138
Gave her a rotation of cover jobs

19:14.205 --> 19:15.839
to keep her at arm's length

19:15.907 --> 19:17.841
while she investigated other agents.

19:17.909 --> 19:20.778
Any idea why she would
betray the agency now?

19:20.845 --> 19:23.947
A month ago, I located a dangerous leak.

19:24.015 --> 19:25.783
DIA had a mole.

19:25.850 --> 19:27.918
I, uh...

19:27.986 --> 19:30.587
...turned to the one
person I could trust.

19:30.655 --> 19:32.322
Norah. When what you were looking for

19:32.390 --> 19:34.324
was standing right next
to you the whole time.

19:34.392 --> 19:36.326
It was her idea to come to New Orleans.

19:36.394 --> 19:38.929
Claimed she had a hit on the mole.

19:38.997 --> 19:42.266
Never would have guessed
it was part of an escape plan.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.968
There's still time to fix this.

19:45.036 --> 19:48.772
Your team is in no position to
continue the investigation.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.340
Let us help you.

19:54.045 --> 19:56.280
I'll get the evidence we've gathered

19:56.347 --> 20:00.217
transferred over to you, along
with Norah's classified file.

20:01.453 --> 20:02.619
The sooner, the better.

20:03.888 --> 20:05.823
Norah didn't do this alone.

20:05.890 --> 20:08.292
We need to find out who helped her.

20:11.896 --> 20:13.664
We're back in the game, Loretta.

20:13.731 --> 20:15.833
I'm hoping you can put
some points on the board.

20:15.835 --> 20:18.335
Well, I put a rush on the DNA analysis.

20:18.403 --> 20:20.304
Genetic markers don't lie.

20:20.371 --> 20:23.307
This poor woman is not your DIA agent.

20:23.374 --> 20:25.976
Only mistake was sharing
a similar physique.

20:26.044 --> 20:27.811
So Norah could still be alive.

20:27.879 --> 20:29.646
Get an ID on this victim?

20:29.714 --> 20:31.181
Not without dental records.

20:31.249 --> 20:33.217
But hypostasis suggests
that she's been dead

20:33.284 --> 20:34.985
for at least 72 hours.

20:35.053 --> 20:36.079
Murdered?

20:36.081 --> 20:38.056
Yeah, a stab wound at
the base of the skull.

20:38.123 --> 20:40.424
Appears the knife...

20:40.492 --> 20:42.759
cut her spinal cord instantly.

20:42.827 --> 20:45.195
- Any luck with the evidence DIA sent?
- Well, it depends

20:45.263 --> 20:47.464
on your definition of "luck".

20:49.567 --> 20:51.051
The gloves Sebastian grabbed

20:51.053 --> 20:53.171
- off the kidnapper at the plaza?
- Mm-hmm.

20:53.238 --> 20:54.605
I pulled DNA from skin cells.

20:54.672 --> 20:56.440
There's no match on any of our systems.

20:56.508 --> 21:00.010
But whoever wore that glove
is a male of Asian descent.

21:00.078 --> 21:03.447
That limits our suspect
pool to about four billion.

21:03.515 --> 21:06.583
Oh. Does that get me
any points on the board?

21:07.619 --> 21:09.186
Wasn't a brick.

21:13.591 --> 21:15.726
What does DIA know
about their double agent?

21:15.793 --> 21:17.127
Norah Bishop,

21:17.195 --> 21:19.363
she was the ultimate DIA recruit.

21:19.430 --> 21:21.899
Joined Mensa when she was six years old.

21:21.966 --> 21:23.734
Programmed her first computer at eight.

21:23.801 --> 21:26.370
Her parents traveled abroad for
work, Norah traveled with them.

21:26.437 --> 21:28.272
She's fluent in six different languages.

21:28.339 --> 21:30.140
So we're dealing with a superspy.

21:30.208 --> 21:31.909
Yeah. But who's she working with?

21:31.976 --> 21:35.712
Norah traveled to Hong Kong
researching her PhD dissertation

21:35.780 --> 21:38.048
on cybersecurity.

21:38.116 --> 21:41.051
Trip was supposed to last six weeks.

21:41.119 --> 21:42.486
She ended up staying six months.

21:42.554 --> 21:44.721
There must be something
in China worth staying for.

21:44.789 --> 21:46.290
Perhaps a change of allegiance?

21:46.357 --> 21:48.125
DNA on the glove Sebastian grabbed

21:48.193 --> 21:50.093
belongs to an Asian male.

21:50.121 --> 21:51.601
The body at the back of the warehouse

21:51.602 --> 21:52.796
was rigged by professionals.

21:52.864 --> 21:54.304
Could be Ministry of State Security.

21:54.332 --> 21:56.012
Chinese intelligence?
Yeah, it makes sense,

21:56.013 --> 21:57.373
if she was recruited in Hong Kong.

21:57.402 --> 22:00.604
Which means that Norah has
been working with the Chinese

22:00.672 --> 22:03.607
long before she joined DIA.

22:03.675 --> 22:05.442
They could've steered her to them.

22:05.510 --> 22:06.743
But why stage a kidnapping?

22:06.811 --> 22:08.278
If she wanted to sell the DIA out,

22:08.346 --> 22:10.948
why not fake her own
death and disappear?

22:11.015 --> 22:13.150
Because...

22:13.218 --> 22:17.254
she needed Winchester
involved in the investigation.

22:17.322 --> 22:19.122
He was the only one who
knew she had access

22:19.190 --> 22:20.757
to classified DIA intel.

22:20.825 --> 22:22.759
The only one who could
peg her as the mole.

22:22.827 --> 22:25.529
Taking out Winchester was
necessary for her escape plan.

22:25.597 --> 22:26.863
We need to tell him.

22:26.931 --> 22:28.932
If we're up against MSS, DIA can help.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.334
I'll call Winchester,

22:30.401 --> 22:32.169
get him over here and
get him up to speed.

22:32.237 --> 22:34.204
Keep looking for Norah.

22:34.272 --> 22:35.839
Agent Carter,

22:35.907 --> 22:37.140
you have a visitor.

22:37.208 --> 22:39.509
You weren't answering my texts.

22:39.577 --> 22:40.978
Oh, I'm sorry, that's on me.

22:41.045 --> 22:42.846
It's a-a time-sensitive case.

22:42.914 --> 22:45.034
I just need a quick word
before I head to the airport.

22:52.924 --> 22:55.392
So, why the need for the face-to-face?

22:55.460 --> 22:58.695
Because I respect you too much
to say this over the phone.

23:00.565 --> 23:05.202
Okay. So, what needs to be said?

23:05.270 --> 23:06.803
It's actually what you said.

23:06.871 --> 23:08.872
This morning.

23:08.940 --> 23:10.674
You called me your girlfriend.

23:10.742 --> 23:12.643
Yeah, because you are.

23:12.710 --> 23:14.511
Actually, I'm not.

23:14.579 --> 23:17.214
Uh, what do you mean? We've
been dating for... three years.

23:17.282 --> 23:20.050
We've been meeting every
other month for hotel trysts.

23:20.118 --> 23:21.485
And it's fun,

23:21.552 --> 23:23.687
but it's not a relationship.

23:23.755 --> 23:26.890
I mean, come on. We
have that connection.

23:26.958 --> 23:28.659
We get along, we never fight.

23:28.726 --> 23:30.494
- We understand each other.
- Sure.

23:30.561 --> 23:33.330
It's fun, it's uncomplicated.

23:33.398 --> 23:36.600
No stakes, no depth.

23:36.668 --> 23:38.548
It's not just the people
you work with, Quentin.

23:38.549 --> 23:39.770
You don't let anyone in.

23:39.837 --> 23:41.271
That's not true.

23:41.339 --> 23:43.440
You refuse to lower your walls.

23:43.508 --> 23:45.776
And at first, it was
frustrating as hell for me,

23:45.843 --> 23:47.844
but I made my peace with it.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.849
You... you met someone else.

23:52.917 --> 23:54.718
Yeah.

23:54.786 --> 23:55.919
Yeah.

23:55.987 --> 23:57.621
It's been casual, but he wants

23:57.689 --> 23:58.955
to take it to the next level.

23:59.023 --> 24:00.390
I didn't know if I was ready.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.426
Until now.

24:02.493 --> 24:04.695
Whatever this is between us,

24:04.762 --> 24:07.864
it's never gonna be enough for me.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.234
Okay, so that's it? We're breaking up?

24:11.302 --> 24:14.271
We can't break up if we were
never actually together.

24:15.773 --> 24:19.710
You are a good guy, Quentin.

24:19.777 --> 24:22.279
But I deserve more.

24:37.628 --> 24:41.231
Norah's been playing me
since the day we met?

24:41.299 --> 24:42.632
Unbelievable.

24:42.700 --> 24:45.335
The human race evolved to trust others

24:45.403 --> 24:47.738
because more often than
not, it's in our best interest.

24:47.805 --> 24:49.673
But not spies.

24:49.741 --> 24:51.908
We're supposed to distrust everything.

24:51.976 --> 24:53.744
Like Norah.

24:53.811 --> 24:57.447
She lived a lie for over a decade.

24:57.515 --> 24:59.082
Question is why.

24:59.150 --> 25:00.584
- Money?
- Patton looked

25:00.651 --> 25:01.752
into her finances.

25:01.819 --> 25:03.320
Nothing raised a red flag.

25:03.388 --> 25:05.388
If she was being coerced,
she would've been

25:05.389 --> 25:07.290
tied to that chair and
killed alongside you.

25:07.358 --> 25:09.493
Agent Gregorio's been
working up a profile,

25:09.560 --> 25:11.428
believes that she's being driven by ego.

25:11.496 --> 25:12.929
She wanted to feel special.

25:12.997 --> 25:14.965
Nothing is more exclusive
than a club of one

25:15.032 --> 25:16.600
as a double agent.

25:16.667 --> 25:20.370
If she makes it to China,
she'll also be a hero.

25:20.438 --> 25:21.805
We can't let that happen.

25:21.873 --> 25:23.106
Okay, then.

25:23.174 --> 25:25.542
You're the one person

25:25.610 --> 25:27.310
who's worked most closely with Norah.

25:27.378 --> 25:29.479
You knew her beyond the agency.

25:29.547 --> 25:31.114
I already told you everything I know.

25:31.182 --> 25:32.549
What about her personal life?

25:32.617 --> 25:34.551
Did she have hobbies or friends?

25:34.619 --> 25:36.887
Did she take, I don't
know, any vacations?

25:36.955 --> 25:38.688
If she was working with the Chinese,

25:38.689 --> 25:40.089
there had to be a point of contact.

25:40.090 --> 25:41.364
No agent is that good

25:41.392 --> 25:42.659
at covering their tracks.

25:42.727 --> 25:44.861
The Caribbean.

25:44.889 --> 25:46.209
She'd go there for long weekends,

25:46.210 --> 25:47.497
two, three times a year.

25:47.565 --> 25:48.899
She loved all-inclusives

25:48.966 --> 25:50.566
'cause she never had
to leave the resort.

25:50.567 --> 25:51.735
And no real paper trail.

25:51.803 --> 25:54.404
It's a good spot to meet with a handler.

25:57.809 --> 25:59.576
Ugh, I hate everything
about this traitor,

25:59.644 --> 26:01.878
but I do know where I'm
going on my next vacation.

26:01.946 --> 26:03.313
What'd you guys find?

26:03.381 --> 26:06.183
Tracked down each of the resorts
Norah stayed at the past few years...

26:06.250 --> 26:07.851
Five-star. Expensive taste.

26:07.919 --> 26:09.686
...and cross-referenced the guest lists

26:09.754 --> 26:11.321
with those travel dates.

26:11.389 --> 26:13.390
- Was her handler with her?
- This Chinese national

26:13.458 --> 26:15.659
overlapped Norah at the
same resort every time.

26:15.727 --> 26:17.627
And travels under different aliases?

26:17.628 --> 26:19.830
Each time. Last trip six weeks
ago was under the name,

26:19.897 --> 26:20.939
"Alex Chang".

26:20.941 --> 26:22.867
Well, that's got to be her handler,

26:22.934 --> 26:25.268
- but who is he?
- That's where the trail goes cold.

26:25.336 --> 26:27.103
We've been digging into each alias,

26:27.171 --> 26:29.005
but so far, they're all ghosts.

26:29.073 --> 26:30.459
No one's a ghost to DIA.

26:30.461 --> 26:32.076
I'll pass along the names.

26:32.143 --> 26:33.877
We've got our own way of finding people.

26:33.945 --> 26:37.180
Hey. I just cracked the code on
how Norah signals her handler.

26:37.248 --> 26:38.381
What you got, P?

26:38.449 --> 26:40.050
Shared e-mail account.

26:40.117 --> 26:42.085
Norah and her cronies
used the same password.

26:42.153 --> 26:44.113
Passing along messages
in the saved drafts folder,

26:44.114 --> 26:45.522
- weren't they?
- Hey,

26:45.590 --> 26:47.550
I don't have Sebastian
here to de-geek this stuff,

26:47.551 --> 26:48.592
so little help?

26:48.659 --> 26:51.027
Norah writes an e-mail, never sends it,

26:51.095 --> 26:53.430
and it saves as a "draft".

26:53.498 --> 26:56.466
The handler sees it,
reads it, then deletes it.

26:56.534 --> 26:59.102
Nothing's ever transmitted,
so there's no digital record.

26:59.170 --> 27:01.872
Clever, but how does
that help us find Norah?

27:01.939 --> 27:03.874
Especially if she's
already fled the country.

27:03.941 --> 27:05.742
Oh, I doubt that. A new e-mail

27:05.810 --> 27:08.778
showed up in her draft
folder after she was taken.

27:08.846 --> 27:11.748
If her handler would've seen it,
he would've deleted it by now.

27:11.816 --> 27:13.456
Means we still have a
chance to catch her.

27:13.457 --> 27:14.618
"The folly of man.

27:14.685 --> 27:15.919
"Why not wo-man?

27:15.987 --> 27:17.554
"Two of one? Separate.

27:17.622 --> 27:19.556
Equal. Without both, there is none".

27:19.624 --> 27:21.324
There's no way Norah's still writing

27:21.392 --> 27:23.159
more bad poetry on the run.

27:23.227 --> 27:25.996
Which made me realize that
this is a coded message.

27:26.063 --> 27:28.064
We've got to get this poem
to DIA cryptography team

27:28.132 --> 27:29.399
right away.

27:29.467 --> 27:30.867
I ask for help from your minions?

27:32.163 --> 27:33.643
It took a patented Triple P algorithm

27:33.644 --> 27:36.145
to find the right cipher, and voilà.

27:38.242 --> 27:39.409
What the heck

27:39.477 --> 27:40.644
is "Monolith"?

27:44.315 --> 27:46.616
What don't we know, Winchester?

27:46.684 --> 27:49.119
And don't give us that
national security crap again.

27:50.988 --> 27:55.425
Monolith is the name of a
program that doesn't exist.

27:57.728 --> 28:01.464
What does this nonexistent program do?

28:01.532 --> 28:05.035
It monitors every spy DIA
handles across the globe.

28:05.102 --> 28:07.137
So if Norah handed it
over to the Chinese...

28:07.204 --> 28:09.673
Every one of those
agents will be exposed.

28:17.769 --> 28:20.704
Just updated the deputy
secretary at Homeland.

28:20.772 --> 28:23.540
They're blasting an alert to
every agency in the Southeast.

28:23.608 --> 28:25.108
We got BOLOs out on every private air

28:25.176 --> 28:26.343
and boat charter on the Gulf.

28:26.411 --> 28:27.711
I'll double back to Winchester,

28:27.779 --> 28:30.614
see if DIA resources have illuminated

28:30.682 --> 28:33.016
anything else on Norah's
Chinese handler.

28:33.084 --> 28:34.885
Let's hope she hasn't
already slipped past us.

28:34.953 --> 28:37.153
We'll put trip wires out, and
hopefully we'll get lucky

28:37.154 --> 28:38.755
and Norah will stumble over one.

28:38.823 --> 28:40.257
I hope you're right.

28:44.696 --> 28:47.564
Oh. I know you're
committed to your froth,

28:47.632 --> 28:48.999
but we got work to do.

28:49.067 --> 28:50.967
Yes. Sorry.

28:52.036 --> 28:54.171
You seem distracted.

28:54.238 --> 28:56.473
Uh, just needed some caffeine.

28:56.541 --> 28:58.375
Audrey, right?

28:59.410 --> 29:02.479
You, um, need a moment?

29:02.547 --> 29:04.548
No, I don't do moments.

29:04.615 --> 29:08.185
All right, well, I'm here
if you want to talk.

29:08.252 --> 29:10.487
But you probably don't
want to do that, either.

29:12.256 --> 29:14.891
You, uh, call it like
you see it, don't you?

29:17.128 --> 29:18.448
Sometimes I can cross boundaries.

29:18.463 --> 29:20.230
Yeah, I noticed that about you.

29:20.298 --> 29:22.365
- Oh? Please, don't hold back.
- Mm-hmm.

29:22.433 --> 29:23.767
Oh, nor should you.

29:23.835 --> 29:25.995
You're the one who tells the
truth, even when it hurts.

29:25.996 --> 29:28.505
Which makes you an effective leader,

29:28.573 --> 29:31.108
despite what the brass says.

29:31.175 --> 29:32.876
Somebody's been gossiping.

29:32.944 --> 29:34.878
Oh, not here. Not me.

29:34.946 --> 29:37.581
But, um, I heard you got demoted,

29:37.648 --> 29:40.751
and I know it was a raw deal.

29:40.818 --> 29:42.753
But for what it's worth,
the way you handled it

29:42.820 --> 29:45.922
is a case study in class.

29:47.992 --> 29:50.827
It's worth a lot, actually.

29:58.536 --> 30:01.304
Tell us DIA's having more luck
than we are, Winchester.

30:01.372 --> 30:05.041
I told you, no one's really a ghost.

30:05.109 --> 30:07.043
The alias Alex Chang
belongs to this man,

30:07.111 --> 30:09.146
Feng Wei.

30:09.213 --> 30:11.733
That's the same man from each
of the resort surveillance photos.

30:11.734 --> 30:12.916
What do you know about him?

30:12.984 --> 30:15.485
A suspected operative for Chinese MSS.

30:15.513 --> 30:17.073
His file's been flagged dozens of times

30:17.074 --> 30:18.221
by international agencies.

30:18.289 --> 30:20.457
He's their top recruiter.

30:20.525 --> 30:22.826
Yeah, well, if he's helping
Norah escape with Monolith,

30:22.894 --> 30:24.261
how do we find him?

30:24.328 --> 30:27.397
We dug into all of Wei's aliases,

30:27.465 --> 30:30.734
and this popped up locally.

30:30.802 --> 30:32.569
What's Deep Gulf Diving Adventures?

30:32.637 --> 30:35.605
Seaplane charter operating in Lafitte.

30:35.673 --> 30:39.242
Specializes in trips to remote
Caribbean dive spots.

30:39.310 --> 30:41.511
I take it Feng Wei's various aliases

30:41.579 --> 30:43.480
have booked their services before?

30:43.548 --> 30:46.616
Multiple times, all arranged

30:46.684 --> 30:49.586
by Travis Hayes, Deep
Gulf's owner and pilot.

30:49.654 --> 30:51.588
Is there more than a passive connection

30:51.656 --> 30:54.191
- between Travis Hayes and Feng Wei?
- Yes, there is.

30:54.258 --> 30:56.660
Hayes spent three years
in Beijing teaching English

30:56.727 --> 30:58.128
over a decade ago.

30:58.196 --> 31:00.130
- Where he was recruited by Feng Wei.
- Mm-hmm.

31:00.198 --> 31:02.718
Seaplane's a great way to move
assets in and out of the country.

31:02.719 --> 31:06.436
Hayes filed a flight plan
for Belize this morning.

31:06.504 --> 31:09.539
- Norah was on that flight. She's gone.
- Not yet.

31:09.607 --> 31:11.541
There's a storm in the Gulf,

31:11.609 --> 31:13.449
it has light aircraft
grounded since yesterday,

31:13.450 --> 31:14.978
but it is clearing soon.

31:15.046 --> 31:16.646
All right, let's bring
these traitors in.

31:16.647 --> 31:18.615
Monolith is priority.

31:18.683 --> 31:23.720
Everything else, especially
Norah, is collateral.

31:32.263 --> 31:33.430
I'll take the far side.

31:40.204 --> 31:42.239
- Set.
- Set.

31:56.721 --> 31:57.821
Clear.

31:57.889 --> 32:00.757
Clear. Winchester?

32:00.825 --> 32:02.993
Damn it, how did we miss them?

32:04.829 --> 32:06.129
The river.

32:29.086 --> 32:30.921
I count six hostiles,
but I don't see Norah.

32:36.794 --> 32:38.962
Federal agents, drop your weapons!

32:40.531 --> 32:41.664
Let's go!

32:41.732 --> 32:43.266
Get on the plane! We're leaving!

33:25.042 --> 33:26.722
This is the United States Coast Guard.

33:26.723 --> 33:28.678
Shut down your engines immediately.

33:28.746 --> 33:31.815
If you do not comply, we
will be forced to open fire.

33:31.882 --> 33:36.286
I repeat: this is the United
States Coast Guard.

33:36.354 --> 33:39.823
Shut down your engines
and prepare to be boarded.

33:39.890 --> 33:42.492
This is your final warning.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.662
Shut down your engines
now or we will open fire.

34:02.896 --> 34:04.530
Thanks. No sign of Norah.

34:04.598 --> 34:06.532
Or any kind of drive with Monolith.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.701
Well, her message said she was en route

34:08.768 --> 34:11.571
to the extraction point.
Maybe we got the wrong one.

34:11.639 --> 34:12.705
Anything?

34:12.773 --> 34:13.974
They're refusing to talk.

34:14.041 --> 34:15.608
Yeah, and Norah's still out there.

34:15.609 --> 34:17.476
Well, she couldn't have
gotten far on her own.

34:17.543 --> 34:19.045
You find anything on the plane

34:19.112 --> 34:21.414
- or on the bodies?
- Yeah, some damn good passports

34:21.482 --> 34:22.649
to get them into Belize.

34:22.716 --> 34:24.851
- One of those Norah's?
- Nope.

34:24.918 --> 34:26.853
Well, wherever she
is, her cover's blown.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.487
She's gonna have a new ID now, too.

34:28.554 --> 34:30.922
Yeah, we need to figure
out who cooked these up.

34:30.991 --> 34:32.358
Get them back to the lab,

34:32.426 --> 34:34.827
get Patton to start
hunting for the forger.

34:34.895 --> 34:37.014
Carter and I will stay and
coordinate with Winchester,

34:37.016 --> 34:39.866
see if any of his DIA
toys turn anything up.

34:39.933 --> 34:41.434
Okay. Let's go.

34:45.072 --> 34:46.672
You got that look on your face.

34:46.739 --> 34:48.841
Yeah. Thinking about Occam's razor.

34:48.909 --> 34:51.444
Simplest explanation is
usually the correct one.

34:51.512 --> 34:52.679
Uh-huh.

34:52.746 --> 34:54.580
And the simplest way

34:54.648 --> 34:57.216
for Norah to get out of
here is on that plane.

34:57.284 --> 34:59.285
- Why isn't she on it?
- Maybe

34:59.353 --> 35:00.920
she's just laying low here for a while.

35:00.988 --> 35:03.388
I mean, she's got to know that
every agency we cooperate with

35:03.424 --> 35:05.224
- is gonna be on the lookout for her.
- Right?

35:05.292 --> 35:08.094
No passport or new look is
gonna make up for the scrutiny

35:08.162 --> 35:11.464
- she'd get at Customs Control.
- Mm-hmm.

35:11.532 --> 35:15.234
Unless the plan was to
never pass through it at all.

35:15.302 --> 35:16.803
Give me a hand.

35:16.870 --> 35:20.006
These crates were supposed
to be loaded on the plane.

35:29.316 --> 35:31.884
I'm not sure what you expected to find.

35:31.952 --> 35:32.952
Come on.

35:57.811 --> 35:58.911
Carter!

36:24.705 --> 36:26.672
Hannah, you all right?

36:26.740 --> 36:27.840
Yeah.

36:27.908 --> 36:29.542
Carter.

36:29.610 --> 36:30.643
You all right?

36:30.711 --> 36:32.478
I don't think your fancy threads

36:32.546 --> 36:34.614
are gonna survive New Orleans, hotshot.

36:34.681 --> 36:37.183
After seeing what's in this water,

36:37.251 --> 36:39.852
I think I'm gonna burn this suit.

36:40.888 --> 36:42.588
Monolith?

36:45.559 --> 36:46.759
What's Monolith?

36:48.395 --> 36:49.629
Take her in my car.

36:56.870 --> 36:59.172
What'd you call him once?

36:59.239 --> 37:01.407
A super secret ass?

37:01.475 --> 37:04.710
Uh-huh. Some things never change.

37:11.051 --> 37:14.554
You finally gonna join
us at the bar tonight?

37:14.621 --> 37:16.656
Uh, thank you, no, thank you.

37:16.723 --> 37:19.225
- I got a lot of work to do here.
- Mm.

37:19.293 --> 37:22.528
Okay. Well...

37:22.596 --> 37:25.731
...if it's a drinking-alone
kind of night...

37:25.799 --> 37:27.725
you might as well drink the good stuff.

37:27.727 --> 37:29.093
- Ooh.
- I know, I just...

37:29.095 --> 37:30.795
I did not take you for a whiskey girl.

37:30.796 --> 37:32.697
Yeah, well, you don't know me very well.

37:32.764 --> 37:33.873
But you could.

37:33.941 --> 37:36.442
Oh, not gonna bite, Khoury.

37:36.510 --> 37:37.944
Hmm.

37:38.011 --> 37:40.346
It's HQ with another e-mail blast.

37:41.515 --> 37:42.715
Damn.

37:42.783 --> 37:45.685
Deputy Director Van
Cleef is leaving NCIS,

37:45.752 --> 37:47.286
pending Senate approval, to become

37:47.354 --> 37:50.356
chief of naval operations for DoD.

37:50.424 --> 37:51.924
Talk about a career leap.

37:51.992 --> 37:53.426
Yeah, it is.

37:53.493 --> 37:54.627
Oh, you know him.

37:54.695 --> 37:56.629
Hmm?

37:56.697 --> 37:58.030
Um...

37:58.098 --> 38:00.533
we've had a few interactions.

38:00.601 --> 38:01.934
Any chance he was

38:02.002 --> 38:03.769
involved in your demotion?

38:03.837 --> 38:06.539
It doesn't matter. That's in the past.

38:06.607 --> 38:10.810
You know, I worked with a
woman at NCIS: Pearl Harbor.

38:10.878 --> 38:12.144
She also had

38:12.212 --> 38:14.247
a few interactions with Van Cleef.

38:14.314 --> 38:16.282
It didn't end well for her, either.

38:18.118 --> 38:20.119
Enjoy that whiskey, huh?

38:28.729 --> 38:30.997
♪ Dancin' to the truth ♪

38:34.368 --> 38:36.736
♪ Let your body move ♪

38:39.873 --> 38:41.574
♪ Dancin' to the truth... ♪

38:43.211 --> 38:45.011
Well, here's to closing our first,

38:45.012 --> 38:47.446
and hopefully last,
joint case with the DIA.

38:47.514 --> 38:49.448
Amen.

38:49.516 --> 38:51.156
I'm just dying to know
what other programs

38:51.184 --> 38:52.652
DIA has that "don't exist".

38:52.719 --> 38:53.762
I could find a back door

38:53.764 --> 38:55.155
- into their system.
- Mm.

38:55.222 --> 38:58.491
We are not getting mixed up in anything

38:58.558 --> 39:01.294
that could bring Winchester
back down here again.

39:01.361 --> 39:02.929
- Who wants another round?
- Yeah.

39:02.996 --> 39:04.356
- Me.
- Yes, sir.

39:04.357 --> 39:06.632
- Okay, I got 'em.
- One beer's not gonna hurt.

39:06.700 --> 39:09.468
Alcohol will not mend your
broken ribs, Sebastian.

39:09.536 --> 39:11.056
Lucky I brought you here to celebrate.

39:11.104 --> 39:12.705
It's not much of a celebration.

39:12.773 --> 39:14.941
Here, pumpkin. I swiped
this before we left.

39:15.008 --> 39:17.944
- I figured you'd want it.
- Oh, my God, I could kiss you.

39:18.011 --> 39:20.451
Nah, just put the spoon in your
mouth instead. You'll be fine.

39:20.452 --> 39:21.514
Anybody heard from Hannah?

39:21.581 --> 39:22.615
No.

39:22.682 --> 39:24.783
Thought she'd be here by now.

39:33.024 --> 39:36.024
_

39:45.973 --> 39:47.673
You're the last person I expected

39:47.741 --> 39:50.376
to get an urgent call from.

39:50.444 --> 39:53.312
Well, I wanted to catch you
before you went back to D.C.

39:53.380 --> 39:57.183
I, um... I was hoping you
could do me a personal favor.

39:58.785 --> 40:00.820
I appreciate your help
with Norah Bishop,

40:00.887 --> 40:02.989
but the DIA isn't in the
business of personal favors.

40:03.056 --> 40:04.824
Well, I'm not asking the DIA.

40:04.891 --> 40:06.292
I'm asking you.

40:09.763 --> 40:13.899
You owe me for North
Africa and now for here.

40:13.967 --> 40:16.168
Is that a threat?

40:16.236 --> 40:17.770
No, Winchester.

40:17.838 --> 40:19.472
It's a fact.

40:24.811 --> 40:27.713
You don't want to help, don't help.

40:27.781 --> 40:30.116
I'll survive.

40:30.183 --> 40:33.652
I didn't get a chance to
thank you back at the docks.

40:37.691 --> 40:39.325
Thank you.

40:42.496 --> 40:44.263
I know that wasn't easy for you.

40:45.932 --> 40:47.500
You have no idea.

40:52.472 --> 40:54.473
What kind of favor do you need?

40:57.444 --> 41:00.179
I need you to look into somebody for me.

41:01.214 --> 41:03.149
NCIS has resources.

41:03.216 --> 41:04.717
Why not just use those?

41:04.785 --> 41:05.951
NCIS can't know about this.

41:06.019 --> 41:07.753
This has to be strictly off the record,

41:07.821 --> 41:09.722
and that is what you do best.

41:15.162 --> 41:18.397
What do you want to know about
Deputy Director Ezra Van Cleef?

41:18.465 --> 41:20.466
Everything.

41:22.002 --> 41:24.002
I heard chatter for months
about his new promotion.

41:25.172 --> 41:26.439
Are you sure it's wise

41:26.506 --> 41:28.074
to go kicking that hornet's nest?

41:29.810 --> 41:31.710
No.

41:33.346 --> 41:35.081
But I'm gonna do it anyway.
