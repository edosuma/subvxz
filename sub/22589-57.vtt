00:10.595 --> 00:13.640
<i>NARRATOR".
A picturesque day in Gotham city.</i>

00:13.806 --> 00:16.434
<i>Even more picturesque than usual.</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:23.608
<i>And in one of the many picturesque art galleries
where culture-loving Gothamites gather...</i>

00:27.862 --> 00:30.198
Are you interested in purchasing
the painting, sir?

00:30.365 --> 00:31.407
Not for myself.

00:31.574 --> 00:33.618
But my employer, millionaire Bruce Wayne...

00:33.785 --> 00:36.913
...is very interested
in acquiring an original Muzzy.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.583
Oh, you don't say. Well, then perhaps
you'd like to meet the artist himself.

00:40.750 --> 00:44.420
- It would be a pleasure.
-No sooner said than done.

00:44.587 --> 00:45.630
This way.

00:50.093 --> 00:52.220
- Mr.--
-Alfred will do.

00:52.387 --> 00:56.599
Mr. Alfred, allow me to present
Mr. Oliver Muzzy, beloved American artist.

00:56.808 --> 00:58.601
It's an honor.

01:01.479 --> 01:05.149
Hey, this an outrage.
An outrage against art.

01:05.358 --> 01:07.193
An insult, I say.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.779
Oh, ha-ha-ha!

01:09.946 --> 01:16.035
Ugliness, monstrosity, horribility. Ha, ha.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.704
Look at that.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.289
You call that art?

01:19.455 --> 01:20.957
And this thing. Pah!

01:21.124 --> 01:22.959
Disgusting. Oh, ho, ho.

01:23.126 --> 01:26.045
And this, worse and worse.

01:26.254 --> 01:29.257
Oh, this ugliness must be destroyed. Ha, ha.

01:29.465 --> 01:33.011
Down with ugliness. Away with dullness.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.767
Take this. Take this and that. Ha-ha-ha!

01:39.934 --> 01:41.227
Take that.

01:45.857 --> 01:47.692
Take that.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.284 --> 01:58.244
Fiend. Monster.

01:58.453 --> 02:00.997
I'd appreciate your mentioning it
to Mr. Wayne at once.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.375
- All right, Alfred. I'll tell him right away.
-Thank you, madam.

02:06.711 --> 02:09.714
Take that, take that and that.

02:12.592 --> 02:13.760
Aunt Harriet.

02:13.968 --> 02:17.472
Oh, Bruce, Alfred just called
from the Park gallery.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.642
He's found a painting
he thinks you'll be very interested in.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.979
- Mm-hm.
-it's called, uh, "The Laughing Man."

02:25.146 --> 02:27.398
Well, that sounds very interesting,
Aunt Harriet.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.859
Dick and I will go down
and have a look at it now.

02:30.026 --> 02:32.654
Oh, I do hope you like it, Bruce.

02:35.657 --> 02:38.242
- The Laughing Man?
-That's Alfred's way of telling us...

02:38.409 --> 02:41.746
...that one of Gotham City's arch villains
is at Park Gallery right now.

02:41.913 --> 02:43.039
Holy tip-off, Joker.

02:43.206 --> 02:48.252
Exactly, and I think you better continue your
education at the Park Gallery as Robin.

02:48.461 --> 02:50.713
To the Bat-poles.

02:52.882 --> 02:54.467
What happened to the signs, Bruce?

02:54.634 --> 02:56.969
Alfred removed them
to put a new coat of paint.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.097
Good old, Alfred.

04:37.028 --> 04:39.989
- Batman. Thank heavens.
-Unh!

04:40.156 --> 04:44.911
Stay back, you caped clunk-heads
or I'll turn you into a paisley shawl.

04:45.119 --> 04:49.415
From the stains on your gun barrel, I'd say
you're using very soft bullets these days.

04:59.842 --> 05:05.139
Ugh. Internal injuries. I'm going to die.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.266
I hope you do, you finagling fiend.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.061
Batman, did you see
what he did to the pictures?

05:10.269 --> 05:12.897
Priceless works of art destroyed forever.

05:13.105 --> 05:17.235
Think of the loss to posterity
and the loss to my profits.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.529
Yes, the damage is irreparable.

05:19.695 --> 05:23.866
But at least you can be sure the Joker won't
be doing any more decorating for a long time.

05:24.033 --> 05:27.245
He's destroyed the work
of America's most beloved artists.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.872
Shut up, you bubbling buffoon.

05:30.081 --> 05:33.543
I have been trying to paint
this modern stuff for years.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.294
I could never get the hang of it.

05:35.461 --> 05:40.967
All I could ever draw is stupid looking
farm boys and puppy dogs.

05:41.175 --> 05:45.304
Now this, ha, ha, this is art.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.558
Mr. Joker, let me congratulate you.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.936
Your work is magnificent.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.563
Holy hoaxes.

05:53.771 --> 05:58.568
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, well, excuse my appearance,
Mr. Muzzy...

05:58.734 --> 06:04.615
...but, yes, these uncultured boobs
have no appreciation for fine art.

06:04.824 --> 06:05.867
Obviously.

06:06.075 --> 06:11.706
By the way, Mr. Joker, would you consider
sharing the credits for those paintings?

06:11.914 --> 06:16.711
- After all, mine are underneath.
-Why not? Ha, ha!

06:16.919 --> 06:20.882
A 50-50 split. I mean co-authorship.

06:21.424 --> 06:24.010
Oh, thank you, thank you.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.597
Peasant. Philistine. Ha-ha-ha.

06:27.805 --> 06:32.768
Well, what can you expect from a man who
appears in public in such a ridiculous outfit?

06:36.022 --> 06:41.193
There, Batman, now you're wearing
an original Joker, signed by the artist.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.486
Ha-ha-ha!

06:42.653 --> 06:47.366
Come, boys. Let's leave this zoo
full of bourgeois baboons.

06:47.575 --> 06:52.246
And henceforth, Batman,
stay out of art galleries, hmm?

06:52.413 --> 06:54.790
Ooh, ha-ha-ha!

06:58.169 --> 07:00.922
Are we just going to let him walk
out of here?

07:01.130 --> 07:03.799
We have no choice, Robin.
He's committed no crime.

07:04.008 --> 07:07.470
As a matter of fact, he's increased
the value of these paintings.

07:07.637 --> 07:10.222
I think we should discuss this
with Commissioner Gordon.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.686
The nerve of that clown.
Paint all over your shirt.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.315
Batman, you should have cracked
his pate for him.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.693
His damage to me is unimportant,
Chief O'Hara.

07:22.902 --> 07:26.739
What concerns us is his potential damage
to Gotham City.

07:26.948 --> 07:32.244
I'm sure Joker has some larger scheme
of which this only the first step.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.871
You're right, Batman.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.707
That crook has something up his sleeve
besides his elbow.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.878
I'd suggest putting some extra guards
at all the museums, commissioner.

07:41.087 --> 07:43.464
What about some of the valuable
private collections?

07:43.631 --> 07:44.715
Right, Boy Wonder.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.426
You keep them under close surveillance,
Chief O'Hara.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.137
I'll watch over them like a mother hen,
commissioner.

07:50.805 --> 07:54.517
That's about all we can do
until Joker makes a move.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.602
To the Batcave, Robin.

07:58.354 --> 08:01.315
I'm sorry
about not having a clean costume, sir.

08:01.524 --> 08:06.362
I meant to wash them, but I've been so busy
trying to get the Bat-poles repainted.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.863
First things first, Alfred.

08:08.072 --> 08:13.494
Batman, there's an interesting notice in the
current issue of the Gotham City Art <i>News.</i>

08:13.828 --> 08:15.371
Mm.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.081
That is interesting.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.252
- Yes, commissioner.
- A bit of news, Batman.

08:21.460 --> 08:26.298
Believe it or not, the Joker has been invited to
enter the Gotham City International Art Contest.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.759
Yes, I just found out about it myself.

08:28.968 --> 08:32.596
I plan to have 50 plainclothesmen
at the contest, Batman.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.475
That's likely to put Joker on his guard,
commissioner.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.937
Perhaps it would be wiser
to plant just one man there.

08:40.145 --> 08:43.691
Preferably a man who knows
Baby Jane Towser...

08:43.857 --> 08:46.527
...the wealthy young socialite
who organized the contest.

08:46.736 --> 08:49.196
Yeah, I've got it.

08:49.405 --> 08:52.074
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire philanthropist.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.493
He's cooperated with us many times
in the past...

08:54.660 --> 08:57.121
...and travels in the same social
circles as Towser.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.331
Excellent idea, commissioner.

08:59.540 --> 09:03.919
I suggest that you call Mr. Wayne immediately
and apprise him of the situation.

09:04.128 --> 09:05.629
Right, Batman.

09:10.384 --> 09:15.014
Why is Joker entering that contest?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.684
Especially since they're not offering
a cash prize.

09:25.107 --> 09:29.779
<i>NARRATOR". And so the next day
at the Gotham City Art Center...</i>

09:29.987 --> 09:31.322
Ladies and gentlemen...

09:31.530 --> 09:34.533
...before we begin Gotham City's
International Art Contest...

09:34.742 --> 09:39.371
...I'd like to introduce the five
world famous artists who are competing.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.251
The renowned Spanish artist,
well known for his pink and blue periods...

09:44.460 --> 09:46.504
...Mr. Pablo Pincus.

09:51.050 --> 09:55.805
I'm sure you all know our American artist,
Mr. Jackson Potluck.

09:59.517 --> 10:01.727
The noted Italian artist...

10:01.936 --> 10:07.024
...painter of the world famous fresco
<i>Midnight</i> Snack...

10:07.233 --> 10:09.235
...Leonardo Davinsky.

10:14.406 --> 10:19.453
And the Dutch artist,
founder of the Neo Gamon School of Art...

10:19.662 --> 10:22.581
...Mr. Vincent Van Gauche.

10:26.877 --> 10:32.133
And now, finally, Gotham City's
own entry in the art contest...

10:32.341 --> 10:33.884
...the Joker.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.642
How can they clap for that crook?

10:41.851 --> 10:45.980
Don't forget, Dick, this is a hometown crowd
and Joker is from Gotham City.

10:48.399 --> 10:51.861
The artists have three minutes
to complete a painting.

10:52.069 --> 10:57.616
At the end of that time, the judges
will select a winner and award the grand prize.

10:57.825 --> 11:03.706
Ready, artists? On your mark, get set...

11:55.966 --> 11:59.011
Modern art tends
to be rather unrestrained, Dick.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.721
- Unrestrained?
-Yes.

12:00.888 --> 12:04.683
Governor Stonefellow should declare
this place a disaster area.

12:06.477 --> 12:10.105
-Isn't it magnificent?
-Glorious.

12:35.965 --> 12:39.176
Joker, the time is almost up
and you haven't started your painting.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.679
Started? My dear, I've almost finished.

12:41.887 --> 12:45.724
Oh, yes, every line in place,
every color balanced.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.727
Just needs one more little touch.

13:02.783 --> 13:07.830
Now, gentlemen, let us consider
the works of these marvelous artists.

13:09.999 --> 13:12.501
Interesting use of color.

13:15.963 --> 13:20.426
A fine example of, uh, neorealism.

13:26.515 --> 13:30.019
Ah. Excellent harmonic composition.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.114
A fine study in abstract.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.167
What is that?

13:54.752 --> 13:58.881
My painting is titled,
Death of a Mauve Bat.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.008
Where is the bat?

14:01.216 --> 14:03.344
Well, the bat, gentlemen, is dead.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.972
It died in 1936, a very bad year for bats.

14:07.181 --> 14:11.310
Of course, the bat is dead. It's symbolic.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.479
Symbolic of what?

14:13.687 --> 14:17.066
The emptiness of modern life. What else?

14:17.274 --> 14:19.902
Gentlemen, come with me.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.574
There's absolutely no doubt
about who the winner is.

14:25.783 --> 14:30.537
- I kind of like what the monkey did.
-I think our decision should be unanimous.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very pleased to announce...

14:33.749 --> 14:39.922
...that the winner of the Gotham City
International Art Contest is the Joker.

14:49.348 --> 14:52.810
Joker's painting, <i>Death</i> of a Mauve Bat...

14:53.018 --> 14:56.897
...will hang in an honored place
in the Gotham City Museum.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.116
- I don't believe it, Bruce.
-As winner of the grand prize...

15:07.282 --> 15:11.120
...I would like to announce the opening
of a new school for aspiring artists...

15:11.328 --> 15:16.208
...where I personally will instruct my students
in the secrets of modern art.

15:16.417 --> 15:21.922
Yes, applications for the Joker Art Institute
are now being accepted by my assistants.

15:26.301 --> 15:30.097
Sorry, millionaires only, please.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.392
I want to be the very first student
in your art school...

15:33.559 --> 15:35.644
...you big hunk of genius, you.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.188
Well, of course, my dear.

15:38.397 --> 15:41.817
Your filthy rich daddy
is several times a millionaire, I believe.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.237
Oh, yes, I'm the heiress
to the paperclip fortune, you know?

15:45.404 --> 15:48.198
Oh, well, sign right here, please.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.742
I begin to see Joker's plan.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.620
He wins the contest
so he can start an art school.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.914
In which he enrolls only millionaires.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.501
In which case, he should welcome
millionaire Bruce Wayne as a student.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.633
Joker, I'd like to enroll
in your new art institute.

16:06.842 --> 16:10.471
Well, if it isn't billionaire, Bruce Wayne,
the wealthy philanthropist.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.389
Consider yourself enrolled.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.601
Aren't you going to give me a test
to see whether I have talent?

16:15.809 --> 16:20.689
Oh, the rich, the well-born and the able,
Mr. Wayne, all have talent.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.524
Especially the rich.

16:29.907 --> 16:33.785
We're getting a good strong signal from
that homing device Bruce has in his pocket.

16:33.952 --> 16:38.457
The Bat-radarscope indicates
that he's at Location RIP-478.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.169
- Please check that on the Batcomputer, Alfred.
-Very good.

16:44.880 --> 16:49.885
Location RIP-478 is a building
on Eleanor Place.

16:50.093 --> 16:53.597
Bruce is carrying a miniature
Bat-communicator under his jacket lapel.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.266
He'll let us know if Joker tries anything.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.186
Good morning, dear students. Good morning.

16:59.394 --> 17:03.482
My, but it's good to see
you all working so diligently. Ha-ha-ha.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.694
Oh, we are a happy cheery group, aren't we?

17:07.903 --> 17:11.781
Oh, today's lesson is in still-life sculpture.

17:11.990 --> 17:17.079
I shall walk around you
and give you my criticism as you work.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.623
Oh, very good, Mrs. Putney. Very good.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.751
Oh, but this orange is not quite right.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.756
Oh, Joker, that's not an orange. It's a pear.

17:27.964 --> 17:31.343
Oh, but of course, Mrs. Putney. Of course.
Ha-ha-ha.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.595
Well, keep up the good work.

17:35.180 --> 17:40.102
Ooh, ha, ha! Well, you're making splendid
progress, Mrs. Van Dormer.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.021
Yeah. Ew. Ha-ha-ha.

17:43.188 --> 17:46.900
Oh, yes, now stick to it. Stick to it.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.864
Well, now, barbed wire is the medium
of the future, Mrs. Runcilmeyer.

17:53.073 --> 17:56.577
But that is no way to make a banana.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.956
Now that is a banana.

18:04.001 --> 18:07.754
Baby Jane? Baby Jane?

18:09.339 --> 18:12.509
- How do you like my work?
-Oh, fine. First rate.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.012
Fruitiest sculpture I ever saw.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.890
But I'm not sculpting the fruit.
I'm sculpting you.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.852
- Me?
-Didn't you recognize it?

18:22.060 --> 18:24.980
Oh, but of course I recognize it. Ha-ha-ha.

18:25.188 --> 18:28.984
I just didn't realize I was so handsome.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.406
Ew.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.743
Well, that's terrible. Terrible, Wayne.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.579
Why, even a 3-year-old
could do better than that.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.290
Here, let me show you.

18:48.754 --> 18:52.674
- Oh, there. That's more like it. Ha, ha.
-Yes, I see what you mean.

18:52.883 --> 18:54.926
That's about the level of a 3-year-old.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.096
I do the jokes around here, Wayne.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.932
I'd say that was one of your better ones.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.352
Oh, you're very funny, Wayne.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.314
But the joke's on you.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.235
Come in, boys.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.493
No heroics, Wayne,
or the women might get hurt.

19:19.701 --> 19:23.163
I should have known someone like you
would hide behind the women.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.125
- Joker, how could you?
- Ah, tut, tut, my dear.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.878
We artists should not be judged
by ordinary standards.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.255
We're a very special breed.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.841
You're a special breed, all right.

19:35.509 --> 19:39.388
Oh, button your lip, Wayne,
or you'll be buttoning your shroud.

19:39.596 --> 19:43.558
You'll all be happy to learn ransom notes
have already been sent to your families.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.269
You each own a valuable
renaissance art collection...

19:46.478 --> 19:51.108
...which will be delivered to me
in exchange for your lives.

19:53.485 --> 19:54.778
Tie them up.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.700
Something's wrong, Alfred.

19:59.908 --> 20:02.911
It's not like Joker to go this long
without trying some underhanded trick.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.250
- Yes, commissioner?
- Oh, Boy Wonder?

20:08.458 --> 20:12.379
I'm afraid we've put our friend,
Bruce Wayne, in terrible danger.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.257
Joker's kidnapped the art class
and sent out ransom notes.

20:15.424 --> 20:18.510
- We don't even know where he's holding them.
-Holy hostage.

20:18.719 --> 20:20.887
I think Batman and I can find him,
commissioner.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.889
<i>- Will you need help?</i>
-We <i>can handle it.</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:26.518
If the police show up,
innocent people might be hurt.

20:26.685 --> 20:30.605
Something must have happened
to Bruce's Bat-communicator, Alfred.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.066
I'd better get down
to Joker's studio right away.

20:33.275 --> 20:37.279
You stay here and watch the Bat-radarscope
in case Joker moves while I'm en route.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.114
I'll take the emergency Bat-tunnel.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.367
It comes out on Highway One
and I can catch a bus to Gotham City.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.371
Your families had better
send the loot pretty soon...

20:46.580 --> 20:49.541
...or you'll all find yourself
at the bottom of the river.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.126
Even me, Joker?

20:51.334 --> 20:54.212
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear,
but business is business.

20:55.756 --> 21:00.719
Mm. And as for you, Wayne,
I hope your family doesn't deliver.

21:00.927 --> 21:04.264
I'd enjoy dropping you in the drink.
Ha-ha-ha!

21:04.431 --> 21:06.558
I hope you're better at that than at painting.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.519
Oh, you go too far, Wayne. You go too far.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.354
- Joker.
-What?

22:26.596 --> 22:31.184
The nerve of that rich smart aleck, thinking
he could match wits with me, the Joker.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.521
- Why ain't Batman here, Joker?
-Because he's afraid of me, you dolt.

22:34.688 --> 22:38.942
Yes, I knew the day would come
when his spine would turn to Bat-jelly.

22:39.150 --> 22:44.114
Yes, I'm only sorry he isn't here to enjoy
a special surprise I cooked up for him.

22:44.322 --> 22:45.490
Yes.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.576
But Bruce Wayne will do as a substitute.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.663
I'm beginning to dislike him
as much as Batman.

22:54.082 --> 22:58.211
My newest artistic creation, the Mobile.

23:00.505 --> 23:05.760
Too bad that chicken-hearted Batman
isn't here to die on it.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.638
Batman is no more afraid of you
than he is a flea.

23:08.847 --> 23:11.141
And I know Batman well enough
to be sure of it.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.935
Ah, no use trying to alibi for him.

23:14.144 --> 23:17.022
The Caped Crusader
has turned Cowled Coward.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.940
Yes. Ha-ha-ha.

23:19.149 --> 23:23.987
And you'll soon discover that the Mobile
is very mobile. Yes.

23:24.195 --> 23:28.783
As soon as I leave here,
I will activate a motor that will start it rotating.

23:28.992 --> 23:35.999
Yes. Let's see how long you can dodge
these razor sharp palette knives, Boy Bumpkin.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.684
Holy hamburger,
I'll be cut to pieces by these blades.

23:54.893 --> 23:58.897
Stay with it, old chum,
while I try to loosen these ropes.

24:05.070 --> 24:08.949
But by the time you're free,
there'll be nothing left of me.
