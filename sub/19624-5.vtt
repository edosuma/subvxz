00:02.015 --> 00:05.611
Daly: This season,
love is in the air.

00:05.613 --> 00:06.824
Mwah!

00:06.825 --> 00:08.274
Adam, come sit with me.

00:08.276 --> 00:09.470
It's gonna be okay.

00:09.472 --> 00:11.679
This group of people
is really, really fun,

00:11.681 --> 00:14.191
and everyone has so much respect
for each other and love.

00:14.192 --> 00:16.591
Daly: But our coaches
are about to learn...

00:16.592 --> 00:19.657
♪ Love hurts ♪

00:19.658 --> 00:21.991
Tonight, in the fight
to get the best artists,

00:21.992 --> 00:24.591
our coaches will do
whatever it takes.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.657
I don't have anybody like you
on my team.

00:26.658 --> 00:28.124
Oh, yes, you do.
You have a couple of people.

00:28.125 --> 00:29.657
What are you
talking about?

00:29.658 --> 00:30.557
Okay, that's a lie.

00:30.558 --> 00:31.791
Oh, my God!

00:31.792 --> 00:33.524
Blake:
Everybody here wants to win,

00:33.525 --> 00:35.691
and we're pulling out
all the stops.

00:35.692 --> 00:37.991
We'd go crazy
with our voices together.

00:37.992 --> 00:39.824
And shocked to see
this handsome guy.

00:39.825 --> 00:41.457
I saw Gwen doing this.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.291
What?!

00:42.292 --> 00:43.124
Sit in my chair.

00:43.125 --> 00:45.357
[Laughter]

00:45.358 --> 00:48.157
Out of the three choices that
you have, like, it's obvious.

00:48.158 --> 00:49.857
It's so obvious,
we don't have to even say it.

00:49.858 --> 00:51.657
What in the world?
Take it easy, Blake.

00:51.658 --> 00:53.991
Daly:
It will be the wildest night
of the season yet.

00:53.992 --> 00:55.191
Adam: Thought we were
gonna turn around

00:55.192 --> 00:57.157
and you were gonna be, like,
this big.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.057
I haven't lived
the girl dream,

00:59.058 --> 01:00.257
but I want to.

01:00.258 --> 01:01.657
It's his dream to be
a 16-year-old girl.

01:01.658 --> 01:04.956
♪ Girls, they want to
have fun ♪

01:04.958 --> 01:06.657
I don't care why girls

Daly: The fireworks start...

is a win for me ♪

01:11.958 --> 01:13.157
[Laughs]

01:13.158 --> 01:14.458
...right now.

01:16.092 --> 01:19.824
I feel like I've been winning
a lot of Blake's people.

01:19.825 --> 01:21.124
What... What do you mean,
my people?

01:21.125 --> 01:23.024
Like, people that I thought
you were gonna get,

01:23.025 --> 01:24.124
like, I got.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.357
Alicia: I love how
she always gives you,

01:25.358 --> 01:28.324
like, this super-prop thing
about how you're, um...

01:28.325 --> 01:29.157
What do you call him?

01:29.158 --> 01:30.591
A babe? Yeah.
A babe.

01:30.592 --> 01:31.691
A babe.
[Laughs]

01:31.692 --> 01:32.691
I don't know
if you're a babe,

01:32.692 --> 01:33.691
but it's sweet
for her to say that.

01:33.692 --> 01:34.857
What are you
talking about?

01:34.858 --> 01:36.191
You're like Babe
from the movie "Babe."

01:36.192 --> 01:37.691
[Laughter]

01:37.692 --> 01:40.624
Daly:
As the singers nervously await
their blind auditions,

01:40.625 --> 01:42.624
let's meet
the night's first artist.

01:42.625 --> 01:43.957
Sing like you do
when you're in there

01:43.958 --> 01:45.291
singing in your bedroom.
Okay.

01:45.292 --> 01:46.791
Look at him.
He looks like a rock star.

01:46.792 --> 01:47.691
He's got the voice.

01:47.692 --> 01:49.324
Hopefully, he's got
the whole package.

01:49.325 --> 01:50.457
You know I love you.
Thanks, Dad.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.724
My name's Johnny Gates.
I'm 31 years old.

01:52.725 --> 01:55.457
I'm from Providence,
Rhode Island.

01:55.458 --> 01:57.324
My family is super-Italian.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.757
My nana was cooking
all the time.

01:59.758 --> 02:03.491
And my family owned
this Italian-wedding-type venue.

02:03.492 --> 02:04.891
If you ever watched
"The Godfather,"

02:04.892 --> 02:06.924
it was kind of that vibe.

02:06.925 --> 02:08.056
I was a late bloomer to music.

02:08.058 --> 02:09.791
Senior year,
a friend of mine asked me

02:09.792 --> 02:11.424
if I wanted to join the band...

02:11.425 --> 02:13.591
honestly,
because I had long hair.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.824
Our house became ground zero
for the band,

02:15.825 --> 02:18.791
so I had to bring in
more wattage to feed the amps.

02:18.792 --> 02:22.824
I just loved having them all
at my house, practicing.

02:22.825 --> 02:25.524
Great bunch of kids
and great music.

02:25.525 --> 02:28.624
Johnny G.: One day, I remember
sitting in my car,

02:28.625 --> 02:30.857
and Taylor Swift's first single
came on.

02:30.858 --> 02:32.257
Her voice was kind of pop,

02:32.258 --> 02:34.424
but the production was
cool and country.

02:34.425 --> 02:35.991
I was thinking,
"I bet you the guy

02:35.992 --> 02:39.491
that is working on this music
will understand our band."

02:39.492 --> 02:43.157
So, 18-hour drive,
Providence to Nashville,

02:43.158 --> 02:44.391
to meet this producer.

02:44.392 --> 02:45.491
Within three months, though,

02:45.492 --> 02:46.824
we had a big showcase
at a record label

02:46.825 --> 02:48.691
in New York City,
and they signed us.

02:48.692 --> 02:50.491
This is
an amazing story.
Dude, it was
the best day of my life.

02:50.492 --> 02:51.791
Why are you here?

02:51.792 --> 02:53.657
Like other
rock-'n'-roll stories,

02:53.658 --> 02:55.824
we started
working on an album.

02:55.825 --> 02:57.991
Two years went by, and then
we kind of found ourselves,

02:57.992 --> 02:59.491
like, on a shelf.

02:59.492 --> 03:02.624
In 2015,
we moved to L.A.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.657
A month later,
I got a phone call

03:04.658 --> 03:05.891
from our booking agent
at the time.

03:05.892 --> 03:07.557
Said, "Would you guys
want to go on the road

03:07.558 --> 03:09.291
with Rod Stewart
this summer?"

03:09.292 --> 03:12.624
And I was like, "Hell yeah.
Like, yeah. Yes. Now. Yeah."

03:12.625 --> 03:15.457
There's no feeling in the world
like walking onstage,

03:15.458 --> 03:16.791
playing an arena.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.857
Absolute dream come true.

03:18.858 --> 03:21.257
At the moment,
the band is on hold,

03:21.258 --> 03:23.991
and I've been playing solo gigs
around town.

03:23.992 --> 03:26.657
I'm 31 now. I can't be
chasing this forever.

03:26.658 --> 03:30.624
I really do feel like
this is my last big shot.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.824
I'm singing a Rod Stewart song.

03:31.825 --> 03:34.357
On tour, I got to hear
"Maggie May" every single night.

03:34.358 --> 03:35.957
It's a pretty special moment
for me.

03:35.958 --> 03:38.957
I've been fortunate enough
to have a couple chances,

03:38.958 --> 03:41.457
but it's always
just been so close.

03:41.458 --> 03:44.091
Today, it feels different. I
think this is gonna be the time.

03:44.092 --> 03:45.357
Johnny's gonna be
right there.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.624
Yeah, but where
are the chairs?

03:46.625 --> 03:47.691
Right there.
The chairs are there.

03:47.692 --> 03:49.124
Oh, we see...
we look over there?

03:49.125 --> 03:50.491
Yeah.

03:50.492 --> 03:53.157
Okay, it's happening.
This is about to happen.

03:53.158 --> 03:54.592
Inspire me.

03:57.458 --> 03:58.624
John: There he is.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.358
Let's go.
He's laughing.

06:03.392 --> 06:04.157
So, what's up, guys?

06:04.158 --> 06:05.724
Right.

06:05.725 --> 06:07.657
Your energy pops through
the whole place,

06:07.658 --> 06:09.724
and your tone
is outrageous.

06:09.725 --> 06:10.824
I really appreciate that.

06:10.825 --> 06:12.957
Just been playing in bands
my whole life.

06:12.958 --> 06:16.091
Started in a garage,
moved to Nashville, and...

06:16.092 --> 06:18.057
But you're mostly rock,
though, right?

06:18.058 --> 06:19.757
Yeah, I'm a rock guy. My band...
we were out opening

06:19.758 --> 06:21.091
for Rod Stewart...
All: Wow!

06:21.092 --> 06:22.891
...last summer.
I kind of hear
a little Rod Stewart.

06:22.892 --> 06:24.824
You know, I want to say...
it makes sense

06:24.825 --> 06:27.124
because you have
such presence up there.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.957
Your voice
is incredible.
Yeah.

06:28.958 --> 06:31.657
I feel like out of
the three choices that you have,

06:31.658 --> 06:32.591
like, it's obvious
that...

06:32.592 --> 06:33.591
It's so obvious.

06:33.592 --> 06:34.991
I mean,
it's just so obvious.

06:34.992 --> 06:37.091
It's so obvious, we don't have
to even say it, but... Yeah.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.457
I mean, it's so obvious.

06:38.458 --> 06:40.757
It's so painfully obvious.

06:40.758 --> 06:41.691
Johnny, I just want
to say this

06:41.692 --> 06:43.757
because, just hearing anyone
sing that song

06:43.758 --> 06:45.257
is always
such an amazing thing.

06:45.258 --> 06:46.291
Thank you
for doing that, man.

06:46.292 --> 06:47.991
Dude, I appreciate that.
I love that song.

06:47.992 --> 06:49.091
I love it.

06:49.092 --> 06:50.791
[Applause]

06:50.792 --> 06:52.624
I love the range
that you have,

06:52.625 --> 06:54.691
and I love that you're
not afraid to be up there.

06:54.692 --> 06:57.657
And I just don't think
we hear guys in that register.

06:57.658 --> 06:59.024
When you kind of mentioned
Rod Stewart,

06:59.025 --> 07:01.424
I could totally hear
that influence.

07:01.425 --> 07:03.124
I just would love
to have you on my team.

07:03.125 --> 07:05.857
We'd go crazy
with our voices together.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.391
[Applause]
Crazy!

07:07.392 --> 07:08.891
Mm!

07:08.892 --> 07:10.824
Hey, Johnny.
What's up, Blake?

07:10.825 --> 07:14.157
You are capable probably
of a lot of different things.

07:14.158 --> 07:17.224
Selfishly, as just
a fan of yours already,

07:17.225 --> 07:18.957
I want you to stay
in that rock lane.

07:18.958 --> 07:20.824
I just think
we've been missing that.

07:20.825 --> 07:23.724
And, Adam, you missed it,
but as a performer,

07:23.725 --> 07:26.557
he is headed towards
that Jagger type

07:26.558 --> 07:28.257
of stage performer, too.
Alicia: Mm. Mm!

07:28.258 --> 07:31.224
You know what I mean?
I'm just surprised
you know who Mick Jagger is.

07:31.225 --> 07:33.724
[Laughter]
He's got the moves
like Jagger, right?

07:33.725 --> 07:34.724
Moves like Jagger.

07:34.725 --> 07:35.791
That's such a great joke.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.491
I've never heard anyone
make it before.

07:37.492 --> 07:39.057
Thanks for introducing me
to who Mick Jagger is.

07:39.058 --> 07:41.291
Wow. Your sense of humor
is on point.

07:41.292 --> 07:42.624
[Laughter]

07:42.625 --> 07:44.624
Dude, if you stay
in that lane,

07:44.625 --> 07:46.591
you're gonna leave here
with a fan base

07:46.592 --> 07:48.457
ready to see
your concerts, man.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.457
That's exciting.
Man.

07:49.458 --> 07:50.857
[Applause]

07:50.858 --> 07:54.824
Hey, Johnny. Hi.
Me again.

07:54.825 --> 07:56.157
[Laughs]

07:56.158 --> 07:59.591
What I think we have in common
is that whole band world,

07:59.592 --> 08:01.091
that whole mentality.

08:01.092 --> 08:03.524
I started off
in a ska band.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.891
It's hard to believe,
I know,

08:04.892 --> 08:06.124
'cause I'm wearing
a sparkly dress,

08:06.125 --> 08:07.257
but I swear to you...

08:07.258 --> 08:08.624
Yeah, don't let
the sparkles fool you.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.624
...that is where
I came from.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.591
I just think we could work
really well together.

08:12.592 --> 08:13.791
I mean...

08:13.792 --> 08:17.657

17:40.700 --> 17:42.232
They supported me
through everything,

and "The Voice" is validation

For my blind audition,
I will be singing

17:50.033 --> 17:52.532
"Girls Just Want to Have Fun"
by Cyndi Lauper.

17:52.533 --> 17:55.833
I have a more mellow
and acoustic arrangement.

17:57.433 --> 17:59.732
I'm a normal junior
in high school,

17:59.733 --> 18:02.766
and I get to sing
for four global superstars,

18:02.767 --> 18:05.000
and I am so excited,
and it's such an honor.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.799
To be able to get
a chair to turn

18:08.800 --> 18:12.132
would really show that
I do have the talent to go far.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.266

a prayer?
Yes, of course.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.800

I'm 16 years old,

is that you are 16.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.366
You already have
such a cool style.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.832
That's something
you can't really teach.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.099
I loved your voice.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.999
I can remember listening
to old recordings of myself,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.832
and it has, like,
a similar thing,

20:09.833 --> 20:12.666
where it's small
and it's a bit nasally,

20:12.667 --> 20:14.299
but I feel like,
if we work together,

20:14.300 --> 20:16.632
we could work on
warming it up,

20:16.633 --> 20:18.766
and then we could figure out
your path.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.966
So I would love
to work with you.

20:20.967 --> 20:21.799

that was so cool.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.632
At one point,
I asked Blake

20:26.633 --> 20:28.966
if he thought
there was two people there.

20:28.967 --> 20:31.166
Now, I know that sounds crazy.
That's happened to me before.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.232
There's been two voices,
and I started hearing

20:33.233 --> 20:36.899
a different tone come out of
what I thought was one body.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.432
But this happened with you,
and you are one body.

20:39.433 --> 20:40.566
[Laughter]

20:40.567 --> 20:41.566
Well done.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.766
And there's so much
in there

20:43.767 --> 20:46.966
that I would love
to help you pull out.

20:46.967 --> 20:49.766
You're a really special artist,

20:53.467 --> 20:55.666

that unique sound

20:55.667 --> 20:58.799
and that little, tiny-sounding
voice that she has,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.132
that floats around,

21:00.133 --> 21:02.832
but it also has so much power
when you want it.

21:02.833 --> 21:03.999
That's what I was
sitting back going,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.166
"Oh, what's she gonna do

21:05.167 --> 21:06.599
when it gets to
that part of the song?"

21:06.600 --> 21:08.166
And then all of a sudden,
you did that.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.099
It's like,
"What in the world?

21:10.100 --> 21:11.666
I got to push my button."

21:11.667 --> 21:14.766
And even though you're singing
"Girls Just Want to Have Fun"

21:14.767 --> 21:18.666
and two fun girls just turned
their chair around for you...

21:18.667 --> 21:21.099
Hey. Hey.

affected my love for music.

23:41.667 --> 23:42.899
Growing up,
we'd be on road trips.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.499
He would sing all the songs
and make me sing with him.

police officer in the U.S. Army.

leave each other's side.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.132
He did two tours in Iraq.

It's something I didn't
really understand at the time,

23:55.467 --> 23:57.899
but I knew it was
something serious.

23:57.900 --> 24:02.166
When I was 10, it was
a rainy Sunday morning in 2007.

to the door

that my father
was killed in Iraq.

you feel.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.866

24:29.033 --> 24:31.866

I turned to.

Music is just
such a great outlet, you know,

Music was always around
when I was little.

28:12.008 --> 28:14.874
Growing up, we had a family band
called the Rockin' Robins

28:14.875 --> 28:16.741
'cause that was
one of the only songs

28:16.742 --> 28:18.307

how to play.

It was just a fun thing
that we all took to doing.

And then, when I was 12,

28:25.742 --> 28:28.807
I wanted to get more into
folk and rock,

28:28.808 --> 28:31.807
and I ended up doing
a lot of benefit concerts,

28:31.808 --> 28:33.574
which have been
really important to me.

28:33.575 --> 28:37.674
I started playing at
small music festivals, at bars.

28:37.675 --> 28:40.874
There was actually one situation
where I wasn't allowed to sing

28:40.875 --> 28:43.141
because it was
a 21-and-older venue,

28:43.142 --> 28:46.107
so they looped the mic
out to the sidewalk.

28:46.108 --> 28:48.774
My friends were
walking down that sidewalk.

They were like,
"Caroline, what are you doing?"

28:50.542 --> 28:54.474

it was. You play where you can.

28:54.475 --> 28:56.174
For my blind audition,
I'll be singing

28:56.175 --> 28:58.841

really special to me

You have a lot of soulful wisdom
in your voice,

38:55.383 --> 38:56.582
and I was like, "Man."

38:56.583 --> 38:57.682
I felt like you'd have
a big, white beard,

38:57.683 --> 38:58.849
but I guess
it's a normal-colored beard.

38:58.850 --> 39:00.716
That's cool.

your performance.

I don't have anybody like you
on my team and...

39:08.283 --> 39:11.082
Oh, yes, you do. You have a
couple of people just like him.

[Laughs]

39:16.650 --> 39:18.049
Hey, Josh.
How you doing?

39:18.050 --> 39:21.249
I just felt like "This guy
deserves to be on this show,"

39:21.250 --> 39:22.582
and if he's gonna be
on this show,

39:22.583 --> 39:26.082
he may as well be on...

39:26.083 --> 39:28.749
so I was like,
"I'm hitting my button."

39:28.750 --> 39:31.049
But, man, I'd love to have
a chance to work with you.

39:31.050 --> 39:31.949
And we're all
gonna say that

39:31.950 --> 39:33.549
there's nobody like you
on our teams

some of your influences?

39:41.050 --> 39:43.016
Otis...
Yeah.

39:43.017 --> 39:44.616
...Curtis, James Brown.

39:44.617 --> 39:46.116
Oh, that sounds right
to me.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.749
That's the beautiful thing
about music...

39:47.750 --> 39:49.149
like, there's no limits
to where it can go

39:49.150 --> 39:50.482
and where it can reach,
you know?

39:50.483 --> 39:52.282
Absolutely.
Beautiful job tonight.

39:52.283 --> 39:53.749
That was cool.
Thank you.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.916
What would you want
out of a coach?

39:59.917 --> 40:01.416
As a father and a husband,

40:01.417 --> 40:03.016
I'm kind of tired
of playing the bars.

40:03.017 --> 40:05.382
Music's something I think
that our world needs right now,

40:05.383 --> 40:07.049
and that's why
I'm sticking with this.

40:07.050 --> 40:08.582
This is my shot here,
I think.

40:08.583 --> 40:11.949
[Cheers and applause]

40:11.950 --> 40:14.049
I was in my band
for nine years.

40:14.050 --> 40:16.216
We were doing music
because we had to do it.

40:16.217 --> 40:17.582
Like, it was in us.

40:17.583 --> 40:21.482
And I do understand what it's
like to be a working parent.

40:21.483 --> 40:23.282
That's what I struggle with
all the time.

40:23.283 --> 40:25.916
I could definitely share
my experiences with you,

40:25.917 --> 40:26.982
and I'd love to do that.

40:26.983 --> 40:28.382
Thank you.

40:28.383 --> 40:30.049
All right,
I think it's time.

40:30.050 --> 40:33.649
Who do you want to choose
as your coach?

Great job, man.
Thank you, sir.

41:05.883 --> 41:07.249
Appreciate it.
Happy for you, man.

41:07.250 --> 41:09.616
I love how much character
he has in his voice

41:09.617 --> 41:11.282
and how much soul he has.

41:11.283 --> 41:14.016
Moving forward, I want
to keep him in that lane.

41:14.017 --> 41:15.716
Thank you very much for turning.
I appreciate it.

41:15.717 --> 41:17.282
Gwen... she was speaking
some truths to me,

41:17.283 --> 41:18.749
and I was like,
"Oh, I hear you."

41:18.750 --> 41:19.916
Hey!

41:19.917 --> 41:22.616
But as far as where I'm at
as a musician,

41:22.617 --> 41:25.449
I think the wiser decision
was with Blake.

41:25.450 --> 41:26.782
[Light laughter]

41:26.783 --> 41:28.949
I feel like
you don't like me anymore.

[Laughing] I know.
What is...

41:37.983 --> 41:39.882
"What kind of kiss?"
"A French kiss."

41:39.883 --> 41:41.249
Did the French
invent that?

41:41.250 --> 41:42.916
[Laughs]

41:42.917 --> 41:45.049
