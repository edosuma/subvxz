<i> my</i> Real World<i> audition.</i>

19:40.571 --> 19:44.015
<i> LOIS:</i>
<i> Peter... there's something</i>
<i> I want to do.</i>

19:44.242 --> 19:45.408
<i> PETER:</i>
<i> Oh, God, I know that look.</i>

19:45.501 --> 19:48.077
<i> You're ovulating.</i>
<i> Wha-What are you doing?</i>

19:48.095 --> 19:50.170
<i> -(Lois grunts)</i>
<i> -No. No! Aah!</i>

19:50.190 --> 19:51.171
<i> -(screaming)</i>
<i> -(moaning)</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:53.098
<i> (Lois grunting)</i>

19:53.251 --> 19:55.342
Wow.
Lois has strong thighs.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.345
<i> Please, no!</i>
<i> (groaning)</i>

19:58.439 --> 20:00.031
<i> Fine, just get it over with.</i>

20:00.182 --> 20:02.274
<i> I'm gonna be a mom again!</i>

20:02.368 --> 20:05.119
<i> My existence is justified.</i>

20:06.706 --> 20:09.281
CHRIS' VOICE:
The old man's got quite
a meat bag on him, huh?

20:09.434 --> 20:12.935
This... was the night
I was conceived?

20:13.028 --> 20:14.119
(chuckles)
Yep.

20:14.272 --> 20:15.862
That's how it happened
with all of us, Stewie.

20:15.957 --> 20:17.882
That's why we're trash people.

20:18.109 --> 20:19.124
But this means...

20:19.277 --> 20:21.702
technically I'm only
half an accident.

20:21.796 --> 20:23.796
-Yep.
-Thanks, Chris.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.114
It was me.

20:25.207 --> 20:27.016
I was complimenting
my own meat bag.

20:33.066 --> 20:37.068
Brian, say hello
to the new snack captain.

20:37.219 --> 20:39.979
You actually won?
Wow, congrats, Stewie.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.964
I thought you being a mistake
ruined your chances.

20:42.057 --> 20:43.241
How'd you pull it off?

20:43.468 --> 20:46.485
It turns out 70% of
the kids' parents aren't married

20:46.579 --> 20:48.246
and 30% are mistakes.

20:48.397 --> 20:49.896
Nobody gets married anymore.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.474
One kid doesn't even
have parents.

20:51.567 --> 20:54.310
He just kind of appeared.
Sleeps in one of the cubbies.

20:54.328 --> 20:55.419
I mean, that's the story

20:55.571 --> 20:57.313
I would have told this week,
but whatever.

20:57.406 --> 21:00.675
Oh, and Doug died in a commuter
plane crash this morning.
