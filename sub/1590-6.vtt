00:07.707 --> 00:11.343
Spike, you really need
to go to sleep.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.611
Two more minutes, twilight?

00:12.613 --> 00:15.114
I'm just getting to
the really good part.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.448
The mane-iac is about to--

00:16.450 --> 00:17.449
The mane-iac?

00:17.451 --> 00:19.585
The power ponies'
most evil nemesis.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.688
She was the power-mad owner
of a hair-care product company.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.025
A tragic accident at her shampoo
factory in maretropolis

00:26.027 --> 00:28.627
Not only gave her mane
strange new powers,

00:28.629 --> 00:31.230
But also caused her to go...

00:31.232 --> 00:33.766
...Completely insane!

00:33.768 --> 00:36.535
She and her henchponies
are planning to break into

00:36.537 --> 00:39.738
The maretropolis museum
and steal the electro-orb

00:39.740 --> 00:42.608
So she can use it to power
up her doomsday device.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.510
Of course, the mane-iac
wouldn't have even known

00:44.512 --> 00:49.581
If hum drum hadn't slipped
up and told her all about it.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.382
Hum drum?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.818
Guy in the blue boots
and pointless red cape.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.789
The power ponies' bumbling
and totally useless side-kick.

00:56.791 --> 00:59.091
The power ponies have
to stop the mane-iac

00:59.093 --> 01:02.261
Or mare-tropolis is doomed!

01:02.263 --> 01:05.097
Believe me, spike, if anypony
understands what it's like

01:05.099 --> 01:07.633
To get caught up in a
really good book, it's me.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.802
But if we're going to make
any progress fixing up

01:09.804 --> 01:12.171
Luna and celestia's old
castle tomorrow,

01:12.173 --> 01:13.672
We all have to
do our part.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.842
We don't want to be too
tired to lend a hoof.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.444

01:18.678 --> 01:21.213
Ok. Ok. I'm going to bed.
