mean you have to kill yourself.

I got you good!

09:48.754 --> 09:51.188
I don't feel right.
I want it back.

09:55.794 --> 09:57.227
What's going on?

09:57.229 --> 09:58.896
Did that kid from
the future come back?

09:58.898 --> 10:00.764
(gasps)

10:04.903 --> 10:07.371
Oh, no!

10:07.373 --> 10:08.806
(crying)

10:09.774 --> 10:12.543
Meg, are you okay?

10:12.545 --> 10:15.446
(sniffles) You guys, I've tried
everything, but it's hopeless!

10:15.448 --> 10:16.914
He's going to kill me.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.717
I can already
picture my funeral.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.285
(bagpipes playing)

10:23.221 --> 10:25.556
Thanks. Didn't want
to pay for the hole.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.291
This is such
a nightmare!

10:27.293 --> 10:29.093
At least I
have you guys.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.961
I don't know what I
would do without you.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.730
Yeah, uh, about that.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.965
Listen, Meg,
we decided that maybe it's best

10:34.967 --> 10:36.634
if you don't talk to us anymore.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.636
Yeah, we could be
targeted by association.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.738
I don't want to get
beaten up by a guy

10:40.740 --> 10:42.606
unless it's in a limo
after prom.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.909
So you're all gonna ditch me
when I need you most?

10:45.911 --> 10:47.511
Yeah, Meg,
it's natural selection.

10:47.513 --> 10:49.346
This is how it works
in the wild.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.181
Hey.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey there.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.916
Hey. Nice spot, huh?
Oh, yeah.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.118
Oh, yeah, it's great.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.919
Especially 'cause of
that thing over there.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.921
You know what's in there? Corn.

10:57.923 --> 11:00.991
Really? Wow.
I could go for some corn.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.093
(crackling)

11:03.095 --> 11:04.428
(laughs)

11:04.430 --> 11:05.763
You're dark, Rog.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.097
I don't care.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.365
Good luck, Meg.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.834
Now we must retreat
into the shadows.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.903
(wind whistling,
bell tinkling)

11:14.372 --> 11:17.041
(cries)
What am I gonna do?

11:17.043 --> 11:19.643
QUAGMIRE: Sounds like you have
a pretty big problem, Meg.

11:19.645 --> 11:20.911
Huh?

11:22.213 --> 11:24.281
Mr. Quagmire?

11:24.283 --> 11:25.716
What are you doing in here?

11:25.718 --> 11:27.384
This is my base
of operations.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.452
WOMAN (over intercom):
Mr. Quagmire,

11:28.454 --> 11:29.687
the girls' gym class

11:29.689 --> 11:31.355
will be in the showers
in 20 minutes.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.523
Thank you, Shirley.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.058
She's been with
me 12 years.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.225
It's her birthday today.

11:35.227 --> 11:36.794
Didn't get her anything.
(groans)

11:36.796 --> 11:39.029
So, I guess you heard
about the fight, huh?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.665
Oh, yeah, they're talking about
it in all the girls' bathrooms.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.833
I'm so dead.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.134
No, you're not,

11:44.136 --> 11:46.236
because I'm gonna help you
defeat Mike Pulaski.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.237
You are?

11:47.239 --> 11:48.472
That's right.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.573
Be at my house first
thing tomorrow morning,

11:49.575 --> 11:50.741
and we'll get started.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.676
Wow, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

11:52.678 --> 11:55.079
Well, I better get home.

11:56.247 --> 11:58.515
(horns tooting
and whistles blowing)

11:58.517 --> 12:00.784
What a good way
to get around town.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.660
Okay, Meg, you've got a bully
problem, and I'm gonna help you.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.995
But, Mr. Quagmire,
why would you want to help me?

12:11.997 --> 12:13.997
Because I was once
in your shoes, Meg.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.734
I wasn't always the confident
guy you see before you.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.737
You see, I, too,
was terrorized by a bully.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.841
It was 1986, and the cola wars
were at a frenzy.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.944
I was sitting in the RC section
<i>of the cafeteria</i>

12:26.946 --> 12:28.679
when Tracy Bellings approached.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.281
Why aren't you drinking
Coke, you dork?

12:31.283 --> 12:33.050
Pepsi would also
be acceptable!

12:33.052 --> 12:35.219
It doesn't have
to be a two-cola system!

12:35.221 --> 12:38.021
RC is what keeps the big guys
on their toes!

12:38.023 --> 12:40.057
You know what "RC"
stands for, don't you?

12:40.059 --> 12:41.358
"Chicks Rule!"

12:41.360 --> 12:42.760
QUAGMIRE:
<i>She was dyslexic.</i>

12:42.762 --> 12:44.061
<i>Anyway, that was the beginning</i>

12:44.063 --> 12:46.063
<i>of a long,</i>
<i>abusive relationship.</i>

12:46.065 --> 12:48.432
<i>It's one thing if you put</i>
<i>your penis inside-out</i>

12:48.434 --> 12:50.067
<i>in the safety</i>
<i>of your own bedroom,</i>

12:50.069 --> 12:52.236
<i>but to have it done</i>
<i>in the cafeteria...</i>

12:52.238 --> 12:54.638
<i>To this day,</i>
<i>I can't have sex with a woman</i>

12:54.640 --> 12:57.374
<i>against her will</i>
<i>without thinking about rape.</i>

12:57.376 --> 12:59.243
And that's
why I'm gonna help you, Meg.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.611
I never faced my bully.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.479
I don't want you
to make the same mistake.

13:02.481 --> 13:03.547
But how?

13:03.549 --> 13:04.782
Over the years,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.717
I've tested the limits
of the human body.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.386
How much it can stuff in,
swallow or choke on.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.888
How a scrotum can be stretched

13:10.890 --> 13:13.290
into a makeshift sail
if stranded at sea.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.726
All this knowledge is gonna
help you win your fight.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.161
Oh, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.096
I'll take any help I can get.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.397
I haven't been this scared

13:20.399 --> 13:22.566
since my dad stopped showering
for six months.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.101
Great meatloaf, Mom.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.569
Thanks, honey.

13:25.571 --> 13:26.904
PETER:
Hungry!

13:26.906 --> 13:28.272
(flies buzzing)
Hungry!

13:28.274 --> 13:30.107
Pour food on my pile!

13:30.109 --> 13:32.242
Okay, Peter, here you go.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.511
Mmm. I will assimilate
this new smell

13:34.513 --> 13:37.714
into the larger Borg
of my smells.

13:42.453 --> 13:44.087
Oh, by the way,
Rupert, good news.

13:44.089 --> 13:45.756
I pooped out your bow tie.

13:45.758 --> 13:46.957
(gasps):
Gaah!

13:46.959 --> 13:48.258
Geez, what the hell, Brian?!

13:48.260 --> 13:49.426
I can't take it anymore!

13:49.428 --> 13:50.594
(knocking on door)

13:50.596 --> 13:51.829
PETER:
Message for Brian Griffin!

13:51.831 --> 13:53.897
(groaning)

13:55.333 --> 13:56.500
(grunts)

13:56.502 --> 13:58.769
I lost my ass gambling.
Have you seen it?

13:58.771 --> 14:00.137
Leave me alone, you jerk!

14:00.139 --> 14:01.471
Stewie, you got to help me.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.106
Peter just won't let up
with the nudity.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.875
Well, you know how
the fat man operates.

14:04.877 --> 14:06.610
He won't stop
unless he's stopped.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.212
The only way
you're going to end this is

14:08.214 --> 14:10.113
if you find a way
to even the score.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.615
You've got to be nude.

14:11.617 --> 14:12.683
Stewie, I <i>am</i> nude.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.851
I'm just covered with fur.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.018
Well, shave it off.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.220
Give him a taste
of his own medicine.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.521
Maybe you're right.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.022
I mean, I got to do something.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.058
This is just one of those things
he won't let up with.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.961
Like when he was guest hosting
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio.</i>

14:23.963 --> 14:26.797
Jeff Daniels, what
is your favorite Care Bear?

14:26.799 --> 14:30.400
I, uh, uh... I don't know
any of the Care Bears.

14:30.402 --> 14:33.670
Right, but if you had to pick
one, who would be your favorite?

14:33.672 --> 14:35.539
Well, like I said,
I'm not really familiar...

14:35.541 --> 14:38.141
You can just say the color.
I know all the Care Bears.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.810
I... I don't know.
The blue one.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.078
There's, like,
11 blue ones, Jeff.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.412
Are you here to dick around,

14:42.414 --> 14:44.381
or you want to do
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio?</i>

14:47.318 --> 14:49.820
All right, Meg, the best way
for you to focus your rage is

14:49.822 --> 14:51.488
if I wear the
mask of the person

14:51.490 --> 14:53.223
who's bullied you
every day of your life.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.992
Now, when I give the word,

14:54.994 --> 14:56.994
I want you to come at me
with everything you got.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.729
Oh, hey, Meg.
Hey, Peter.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.431
You know, Peter,
I'm glad I ran into you.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.567
We really need
to talk about Quagmire.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.235
You got time for a beer?

15:06.938 --> 15:09.039
I don't know.
He's just so needy.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.375
And I feel like he's
jealous of our friendship.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.010
You all right, Peter?

15:13.012 --> 15:14.778
You seem a little
quiet today.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.380
I'm fine!
Oh, okay, good.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.681
Hey, Peter.
Hey, Joe.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.182
I'm glad
you guys are here.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.184
I've got terrible,
gross medical news for Quagmire.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.420
Maybe you can help me
break it to him.

15:25.590 --> 15:26.857
Mr. Quagmire,
how am I supposed

15:26.859 --> 15:28.458
to beat a guy
like Mike Pulaski?

15:28.460 --> 15:29.726
He's massive!

15:29.728 --> 15:31.561
He may be stronger
than you, but you're grosser.

15:31.563 --> 15:32.796
And you're gonna use that.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.731
Your weird body can be
a dangerous weapon

15:34.733 --> 15:36.366
if used properly.
Okay.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.936
Now, did you ever
play old-school Nintendo?
No.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.305
Well, then what we're about
to do may seem strange,

15:41.307 --> 15:42.539
but just go with it.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.608
(upbeat synthesizer
video game music plays)

15:47.211 --> 15:49.813
(electronic voice):

15:51.983 --> 15:54.384
Now, Meg, in order
to get you into fighting shape,

15:54.386 --> 15:56.586
I want you to drink
this glass of raw eggs.

15:56.588 --> 15:57.955
I don't see any yolks.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.489
Just drink it.

16:02.794 --> 16:04.161
(phone ringing)

16:04.163 --> 16:05.562
BRIAN:
Hello?

16:05.564 --> 16:06.830
Cynthia!

16:06.832 --> 16:08.832
Oh, my God! So good
to hear from you!

16:08.834 --> 16:11.068
(door squeaks)
Sure, I can talk.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.236
I'm just sitting
out here in the open.

16:14.172 --> 16:17.074
(snickering)

16:17.076 --> 16:18.842
My car? It's a Prius.
(chuckles)

16:18.844 --> 16:21.511
I wouldn't say I'm specifically
a hero for driving one.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.081
The heroes are the ones
who come back from Iraq

16:24.083 --> 16:25.349
and drive a Prius.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.249
Gotcha!

16:26.251 --> 16:27.617
(click)

16:27.619 --> 16:29.419
Wha... what the hell?!

16:29.421 --> 16:30.687
BRIAN:
Hey!

16:30.689 --> 16:31.989
You looking for me?

16:33.458 --> 16:36.126
Oh, God,
what the hell is that?!

16:36.128 --> 16:37.527
What's wrong?
You look uncomfortable.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.262
Here, let me give you a hug.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.365
Aah! Get away from me,
you gremlin!

16:41.367 --> 16:45.102
(whimpering)

16:45.104 --> 16:47.004
Aah! No!

16:47.006 --> 16:49.039
Why don't you rub
my belly, pal?!

16:49.041 --> 16:53.777
(whimpering, wailing)

16:53.779 --> 16:56.279
Your skin is so loose
and wrinkly!

16:56.281 --> 16:58.215
It's like I'm just
pushing around

16:58.217 --> 17:00.550
a plastic bag full
of chicken bones!

17:00.552 --> 17:03.687
Ugh! Why do you have
so many nipples?

17:03.689 --> 17:06.790
You gonna put
your clothes on?!
Yes! Yes! I swear!

17:06.792 --> 17:08.625
You gonna keep 'em on?!
Yes, I promise!

17:08.627 --> 17:10.961
I'll never bother you
again with my body!

17:10.963 --> 17:13.296
(crying):
Please, just make this stop!

17:13.298 --> 17:14.464
Good.

17:14.466 --> 17:16.400
Dad, can you give me
a ride to the... ?

17:16.402 --> 17:17.567
(screams)

17:17.569 --> 17:18.869
What is that thing?!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.404
Aah! Make
it go away!
(whimpering)

17:20.406 --> 17:22.372
What's going on in here?
(Peter whimpers, Chris cries)

17:22.374 --> 17:24.141
Oh, my God,
is that a (bleep) rat?!

17:24.143 --> 17:26.710
Peter, hold it down,
I'm getting the gun!

17:30.248 --> 17:31.815
(clock ticking)

17:31.817 --> 17:34.818
(bell rings,
students converse indistinctly)

17:35.987 --> 17:37.654
Hey, who you taking
to Meg's funeral?

17:37.656 --> 17:38.889
I'm taking
Jill.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.524
Ooh!

17:40.526 --> 17:42.926
Wise guy,
we're going
as friends.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.961
(crowd cheering)

17:52.170 --> 17:54.237
All right, Meg, remember
what I taught you.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.206
Relax my throat
and make eye contact?

17:56.208 --> 17:57.507
No, no,
the fighting stuff.

18:01.179 --> 18:04.381
Um, listen, before we start,
could you not hit me here

18:04.383 --> 18:06.550
because these are pretty
sensitive? (groans)

18:06.552 --> 18:07.851
(cheering)

18:13.791 --> 18:15.025
He punched her pretty!

18:16.360 --> 18:18.295
(crowd groans)
Oh, he punched her ugly again.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.463
ALL:
Ah!

18:19.465 --> 18:20.630
ALL:
Aw!

18:20.632 --> 18:21.798
ALL:
Ah!

18:21.800 --> 18:23.033
ALL:
Aw!

18:23.035 --> 18:24.201
ALL:
Ah!

18:24.203 --> 18:25.535
BOY:
Just stop there!

18:25.537 --> 18:26.970
ALL:
Aw!

18:26.972 --> 18:28.472
Punch Rocky Dennis!

18:28.474 --> 18:29.906
It's okay, guys.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.741
I'm at peace
with what I'm all about.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.610
(applause)

18:35.379 --> 18:39.049
(cheering)

18:42.253 --> 18:44.754
Meg, remember
what I taught you.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.423
Use the gross.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.492
(crowd cheering)

18:51.062 --> 18:52.295
You ready for more?

18:52.297 --> 18:54.731
Are <i>you?!</i>

18:54.733 --> 18:56.433
(all gasping)

18:56.435 --> 18:57.734
Ugh!

18:57.736 --> 18:59.903
Your kiss is definitely
not on my list!

18:59.905 --> 19:00.971
He's older.

19:02.406 --> 19:04.341
(laughs)
You missed!

19:04.343 --> 19:05.575
Oh, what's the matter, Mike?

19:05.577 --> 19:07.444
Can't punch a girl
in the face?

19:07.446 --> 19:10.647
You'd be surprised
what my face can do to you!

19:12.083 --> 19:13.383
(all groaning)

19:16.254 --> 19:18.355
Ugh! What's your
problem, dude?!

19:18.357 --> 19:20.023
You've got major issues!

19:20.025 --> 19:21.591
Oh, my God, she's crazy!

19:21.593 --> 19:24.461
Did you hear the volleyball
team lost in San Diego?

19:24.463 --> 19:28.431
All right, you little bitch,
it's time to end this thing!

19:28.433 --> 19:30.433
Yeah, it is!

19:31.602 --> 19:33.236
(yelling)

19:42.280 --> 19:45.015
Oh, my gosh!
Meg won!

19:45.017 --> 19:46.616
(cheering)

19:50.555 --> 19:52.822
Huh, not bad for a loser.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.691
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Quagmire.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.793
I guess I get
to die another day.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.295
Meg, I got a feeling

19:58.297 --> 20:00.564
you're gonna be around
for a real long time.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.133
Come on, let's
get out of here.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.802
MEG:
<i>But I</i> wasn't <i>around</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

20:05.804 --> 20:08.405
<i>A year later, my body reacted</i>
<i>to a frozen hot dog,</i>

20:08.407 --> 20:09.973
<i>and I died of septic shock.</i>

20:09.975 --> 20:13.376
<i>I became the public face</i>
<i>of internal hot dog defrosting.</i>

20:21.986 --> 20:23.153
(groaning)
Cold.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.321
Well, it worked.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.655
Thanks for your help, Stewie.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.824
If I knew you were
actually gonna do it,

20:27.826 --> 20:29.359
I wouldn't have
suggested it.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.429
You look like my foot that time
Lois made my bath too hot.

20:32.431 --> 20:33.830
Come on! It's not that bad.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.699
My fur will grow back
in about three months.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.334
Well, I can't look at
this for three months,

20:37.336 --> 20:38.668
so I've come up
with a solution.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.737
Put these on.

20:44.342 --> 20:45.508
Stewie, I...
Hold still.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.577
(marker squeaking)

20:49.513 --> 20:51.081
There you go.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.917
You look good.
You look <i>really</i> good.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.587
Hi, Stewie, and...
(gasps) Stewie?!

20:57.589 --> 20:59.689
This is next week's story.
Get there.
