WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:01.698
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:01.722 --> 00:04.016
I can't move my legs.
I can't even feel them.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.384
To new beginnings.

00:05.408 --> 00:06.885
To new beginnings.

00:06.909 --> 00:08.387
Maybe I should take a look around, too.

00:08.411 --> 00:09.888
Find a condo, sell the house?

00:09.912 --> 00:11.423
Sell my childhood home?

00:11.447 --> 00:12.891
That's four months of therapy together.

00:12.915 --> 00:14.426
If you could just...
give me your signature?

00:14.450 --> 00:15.693
I can return to active duty.

00:15.718 --> 00:17.262
First day back. How are you feeling?

00:17.286 --> 00:19.364
Last day as Interim Captain.
How are you feeling?

00:19.388 --> 00:20.499
You called my family?

00:20.523 --> 00:22.234
I invited them over for dinner next week.

00:22.258 --> 00:23.368
Why would you do that?

00:26.863 --> 00:31.276
The tiniest spark can start
a fire like a chain reaction.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.346
Sometimes you want to let that
spark catch so the fire grows.

00:34.370 --> 00:35.480
Yeah!

00:35.504 --> 00:37.015
Huh! Go again?

00:37.039 --> 00:39.351
And sometimes you'd better
just put it out...

00:39.375 --> 00:40.416
No.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.882
I'm done.

00:42.812 --> 00:44.523
Your family pushed dinner, by the way.

00:44.547 --> 00:45.991
I'm trying to reschedule but...

00:46.015 --> 00:47.125
Don't hold your breath.

00:47.149 --> 00:49.461
Oh, no, this dinner is happening.

00:49.485 --> 00:50.996
Yeah, you'll eat, you'll talk.

00:51.020 --> 00:52.631
I'll even take an extra shift
at the station

00:52.655 --> 00:55.033
to give you guys plenty of space
to hash all your ya-yas out.

00:55.057 --> 00:56.702
No, no. You're gonna be there.

00:56.726 --> 00:58.503
I'm only in this mess because of you.

00:58.527 --> 01:01.707
So now, you get to sit through
all the "ya-yas," too.

01:01.731 --> 01:04.443
The awkward silences,
the judgmental looks.

01:04.467 --> 01:06.211
And if my mom starts speaking in Yoruba,

01:06.235 --> 01:07.846
she's talking about you.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.581
...because fire is contagious.

01:09.605 --> 01:11.049
Dude, I'm not gonna be some weird buffer

01:11.073 --> 01:12.484
between you and your parents.

01:12.508 --> 01:14.019
It can spread like a disease.

01:14.043 --> 01:15.888
You know, you started this.

01:15.912 --> 01:17.422
You're not getting out of it.

01:17.446 --> 01:18.891
And if you're not careful...

01:26.069 --> 01:28.300
...it'll infect everything.

01:31.827 --> 01:33.372
Andy, you decent?

01:33.396 --> 01:37.120
Uh, I'm naked in
the shower, but, I mean...

01:37.867 --> 01:38.886
Really?

01:38.911 --> 01:40.412
What? You do this to me
at home all the time.

01:41.671 --> 01:45.784
We need shower boundaries
at home and at work.

01:45.808 --> 01:47.753
People are already invading
my space enough.

01:47.777 --> 01:49.121
Nobody else is invading your space.

01:49.145 --> 01:50.255
Well, except for Tanner these days,

01:50.279 --> 01:52.463
but that is clearly both
invited and enjoyed.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.116
You know, my dad had an open house

01:54.140 --> 01:55.742
of my childhood home.

01:55.766 --> 01:58.387
Creepy strangers wandering through,

01:58.412 --> 02:00.790
hanging out in my bedroom,
pawing through my stuff.

02:00.814 --> 02:02.024
Except for the stuff
you moved into my place.

02:02.048 --> 02:03.059
I paw through that.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.394
I mean, it just feels like an invasion.

02:04.418 --> 02:06.046
He's auctioning off all my memories

02:06.070 --> 02:07.153
to the highest bidder.

02:07.177 --> 02:08.745
Oh, this isn't a conversation.
You're just venting.

02:08.770 --> 02:10.514
I mean, I didn't think the
process would move this fast.

02:10.538 --> 02:11.849
What's the big rush? I mean,
I can say anything right now

02:11.873 --> 02:13.317
and you wouldn't even hear it.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.737
I hooked up with Ben. He cried after.

02:14.762 --> 02:15.784
I mean, did I do this?

02:15.808 --> 02:17.830
Did I inspire him to move by moving out?

02:17.855 --> 02:20.601
Yeah, probably. Let's save that
conversation for shower talk tomorrow.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.703
I actually came to talk to you
about something.

02:22.727 --> 02:25.655
No, no more shower talk.
Shower boundaries, remember?

02:27.393 --> 02:28.704
I've been watching Jack.

02:28.728 --> 02:30.939
It's, like, a habit
I picked up while training.

02:30.963 --> 02:32.875
You know, monitor my rivals,
suss out their weakness

02:32.899 --> 02:34.243
to make sure I could crush them.

02:34.267 --> 02:36.712
Gibson and I have been paired up
on Aid Car this shift,

02:36.736 --> 02:38.747
and I still think
he's not sleeping too well.

02:38.771 --> 02:40.582
He seems fidgety and on edge.

02:40.606 --> 02:42.994
And I just saw him arguing
with Dean over nothing.

02:43.019 --> 02:44.879
- What if he came back too soon?
- You're being paranoid.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.266
Jack knows his limits.
His psychiatrist cleared him.

02:47.290 --> 02:49.089
He wouldn't come back if he wasn't ready.

02:49.114 --> 02:50.492
Well...

02:50.516 --> 02:52.727
Okay, still, I'm a little glad

02:52.751 --> 02:54.295
that we didn't have any
real medical calls today.

02:54.319 --> 02:55.363
You know, ease back in.

02:55.387 --> 02:57.198
And shift's over in,
like, 15 minutes, so...

02:58.590 --> 03:00.502
No. Oh, no. Not Aid Car. Please.

03:00.526 --> 03:02.023
Air Car 19, unknown medical...

03:02.047 --> 03:04.372
...at Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel.

03:04.396 --> 03:05.673
Happy stalking!

03:09.465 --> 03:12.111
Oh. No, I figured you'd want to drive.

03:12.135 --> 03:13.445
You haven't driven our
brand-new Aid Car yet.

03:13.469 --> 03:14.647
It handles like a dream.

03:14.671 --> 03:16.148
And I know how much you like
working the woop woops.

03:16.172 --> 03:18.117
Nah, you go ahead.

03:20.390 --> 03:21.942
Okay, clearly we both read the rule book

03:21.966 --> 03:23.042
about two lieutenants on a call.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.270
Yeah, the passenger seat
is the officer seat,

03:24.294 --> 03:25.538
so whoever sits there is in charge.

03:25.562 --> 03:26.639
Driver has to take their orders.

03:26.663 --> 03:28.040
Congrats on reading a book, by the way.

03:29.232 --> 03:31.277
Ah, you know what, Bishop?

03:31.301 --> 03:33.446
I've been lead lieutenant
on countless calls.

03:33.470 --> 03:35.147
You've got, what,
four months under your belt?

03:35.171 --> 03:37.216
Yeah, you need the experience
more than me.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.273
A lot more.

03:44.046 --> 03:45.590
Subway malfunction.

03:45.614 --> 03:48.026
Multiple passengers were
injured from a minor fall.

03:48.050 --> 03:49.461
The subway is stalled in the tunnel.

03:49.485 --> 03:50.829
Use caution when approaching.

03:50.853 --> 03:52.330
Copy, Dispatch.

03:54.089 --> 03:55.333
Can't believe we pulled a "boo-boo" call

03:55.357 --> 03:56.742
this close to end of shift.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.378
A bunch of victims with minor injuries.

03:58.402 --> 03:59.746
These always take a while.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.848
Yeah. Easy, but a little boring.

04:01.872 --> 04:03.972
Not the worst thing, probably.

04:04.942 --> 04:06.820
- Meaning?
- Our boo-boos are located down

04:06.844 --> 04:08.154
in a dark, cramped tunnel.

04:08.178 --> 04:10.524
- Are you gonna be okay with that?
- Yeah.

04:10.548 --> 04:11.914
Why wouldn't I be?

04:15.441 --> 04:17.385
- You got the rollers?
- Rollers, trays, paint.

04:17.409 --> 04:18.720
- Packed and ready.
- And the tarps?

04:18.744 --> 04:19.921
'Cause I'm not doing
this without some tarps.

04:19.945 --> 04:21.623
Hey, look, we're good, we got it all.

04:21.647 --> 04:23.158
Let's go.

04:24.416 --> 04:25.827
Hey!

04:25.851 --> 04:28.130
You guys have plans? For after shift?

04:28.155 --> 04:30.438
Uh, yes, sir. Uh, sure do.

04:30.462 --> 04:34.537
Um... Uh... do... do you?

04:34.561 --> 04:35.839
Together?

04:35.863 --> 04:38.908
You all got plans t-together?

04:38.932 --> 04:40.277
That sounds really pleasant.

04:40.301 --> 04:43.415
Well, the guys just agreed
to help me out is all.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.650
At my place, you know,
repainting some walls,

04:44.674 --> 04:45.885
out with the old, in with the new.

04:45.909 --> 04:46.939
Stuff like that.

04:46.963 --> 04:48.367
- Yeah, super, super casual.
- Huh.

04:48.392 --> 04:50.270
You know, maybe grab
a drink or something.

04:50.294 --> 04:52.472
You know, I had to repaint my
place when I moved to Seattle.

04:52.496 --> 04:54.441
Smart move, getting the help.

04:54.465 --> 04:56.310
A lot harder if you're
painting everything solo.

04:56.334 --> 04:57.477
No doubt, sir. Makes sense.

04:57.501 --> 04:59.674
It's nice to have the help.

04:59.699 --> 05:00.870
- Of course.
- Mm.

05:00.894 --> 05:02.182
It's especially good
when the hands are tall, too,

05:02.207 --> 05:05.620
you know, to reach those high, uh, parts.

05:08.383 --> 05:12.029
You know... you are
welcome to come paint, too,

05:12.053 --> 05:13.764
sir, if you'd like.

05:13.788 --> 05:15.399
I mean, I-I'm... I'm sure
you probably have

05:15.423 --> 05:16.567
other plans already, so...
Yeah, you probably have...

05:16.591 --> 05:19.637
No, I... You know,
just text me the address.

05:19.661 --> 05:20.738
I'll see you there.

05:20.762 --> 05:21.973
- Okay.
- All right.

05:21.997 --> 05:22.997
Yeah.

05:26.835 --> 05:28.942
You just hold that, okay?

05:28.967 --> 05:30.495
Thank you, dear.

05:30.519 --> 05:31.880
- You're welcome.
- That feels better.

05:35.908 --> 05:37.886
All right. What do we got?

05:37.910 --> 05:40.077
Oh, that's not too bad.

05:42.281 --> 05:44.125
Just keep that ice pack on there, okay?

05:44.149 --> 05:46.144
Yeah? The swelling should go down.

05:48.153 --> 05:49.331
Are you checking my work?

05:49.355 --> 05:51.433
You don't think I can handle
a sprained wrist?

05:51.457 --> 05:53.835
Part of my job is making sure
you do yours.

05:53.859 --> 05:55.770
You used to do it to me all the time.

05:55.794 --> 05:57.078
When you were a probie.

05:57.102 --> 05:58.629
Okay, c'mon, we're almost done.

06:02.635 --> 06:04.860
Finally. Someone who
can tell us something.

06:04.887 --> 06:06.332
How much longer
are we gonna be stuck here?

06:06.356 --> 06:08.334
We don't know, sir. They're
repairing the train as we speak.

06:08.358 --> 06:09.774
Is that it? That's all you know?

06:09.798 --> 06:11.869
'Cause I have an important
meeting in 20 minutes.

06:11.894 --> 06:14.039
And I can't call to push it
'cause there's no cell signal

06:14.063 --> 06:15.166
in this stupid tunnel.

06:15.190 --> 06:16.864
Thanks for nothing.

06:20.035 --> 06:21.302
Hello, everyone.

06:21.326 --> 06:22.514
This is Lieutenant Gibson,

06:22.538 --> 06:25.424
and I'm Lieutenant Bishop with
the Seattle Fire Department.

06:25.450 --> 06:27.995
If you sustained an injury
when the train stalled,

06:28.019 --> 06:31.131
please raise your hand,
and we can check you out.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.050
Hi. Yes, hello.

06:39.074 --> 06:40.752
I'm Tenney, 56.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.187
I have a history of high blood pressure.

06:42.211 --> 06:43.355
And low blood pressure.

06:43.379 --> 06:46.324
- And I taste copper.
- Okay.

06:46.348 --> 06:47.859
- And how were you injured, sir?
- Oh, no, I wasn't.

06:47.883 --> 06:49.932
I just wanted to offer you my assistance.

06:49.956 --> 06:51.162
Assistance?

06:51.186 --> 06:53.031
Yeah, like, I'm a security guard
with Seattle Fidelity.

06:53.055 --> 06:54.379
You know, basically a cop,

06:54.403 --> 06:55.943
except with a Taser and a whistle.

06:55.967 --> 06:57.768
So if you need anything,
just put me in, Coach.

06:57.793 --> 06:58.922
Okay.

06:58.947 --> 07:00.785
Well, we're good for now,

07:00.810 --> 07:03.456
but we will call you in when we need you.

07:03.521 --> 07:05.899
Hello. Did you fall
when the train stopped?

07:05.923 --> 07:07.668
M-My son, Will, did,

07:07.692 --> 07:08.969
because he was playing that game

07:08.993 --> 07:10.370
instead of holding on to the rail.

07:10.394 --> 07:12.539
I-I mean, I... I should've just
taken it from him, but...

07:12.563 --> 07:13.907
Hey, buddy?

07:13.931 --> 07:15.409
The nice lady needs to check
you out for a second.

07:15.433 --> 07:16.710
Could you maybe put the tablet down?

07:18.536 --> 07:20.347
No.

07:20.371 --> 07:22.216
Okay, um...

07:22.240 --> 07:24.184
Come on, Will. How 'bout for a-a candy?

07:24.208 --> 07:25.819
I got the little red ones that you like.

07:25.843 --> 07:27.618
I haven't liked those since first grade.

07:27.642 --> 07:30.030
Okay. But maybe just, for now...

07:30.055 --> 07:31.232
I said no!

07:31.256 --> 07:32.983
Dad! I'm busy!

07:34.593 --> 07:36.697
We just got off a 15-hour flight

07:36.731 --> 07:38.709
and hopped on this train
directly from the airport

07:38.733 --> 07:40.344
and... and now we're stuck here.

07:40.368 --> 07:41.578
Hey, Will?

07:41.602 --> 07:43.447
Hey, Will. I'm Maya.

07:43.471 --> 07:45.449
Would you mind if I did a quick exam?

07:45.473 --> 07:48.151
It won't hurt. I promise.

07:48.175 --> 07:51.156
Okay, fine. Just let me save my level.

07:54.122 --> 07:57.101
My dad keeps texting me about
buyers for his house

07:57.125 --> 07:59.170
in all caps with no punctuation.

07:59.194 --> 08:01.138
He wants me to come over and
weed through them with him.

08:01.162 --> 08:02.300
I don't want to weed.

08:02.324 --> 08:03.674
"Hi, Andy, this is your father.

08:03.698 --> 08:05.510
A man with three earrings
and a tiny puppy

08:05.534 --> 08:06.744
is offering all cash.

08:06.768 --> 08:09.190
I said no on principle.
Tiny puppies are weird."

08:09.214 --> 08:10.403
What?

08:10.427 --> 08:12.316
And your dad has a Bitmoji.

08:12.340 --> 08:13.660
Um, can we help you?

08:13.684 --> 08:15.248
No, I'm all good. Thanks!

08:15.273 --> 08:17.451
Uh, actually, you're not.
You're technically trespassing.

08:17.475 --> 08:20.548
Oh. Sorry, I wasn't trying to...

08:21.955 --> 08:23.899
You guys think I'm creepy now,

08:23.924 --> 08:26.637
like I just wandered in
all quiet and unannounced,

08:26.661 --> 08:27.704
and now I'm leaving.

08:27.728 --> 08:29.039
You guys had no idea that I was here.

08:29.063 --> 08:31.608
Um, well, didn't you?

08:31.632 --> 08:32.643
Let me start over.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.943
I'm Kathleen.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.111
Kat for short.

08:35.135 --> 08:36.847
I'm a cadet at the Fire Academy.

08:36.871 --> 08:38.649
I was just stopping by
to check out the place.

08:38.673 --> 08:40.250
I'm checking out all the stations

08:40.274 --> 08:42.964
just to see where
I might fit in, you know?

08:42.989 --> 08:44.099
Assuming I graduate.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.501
Well, most graduates
do want to come here.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.835
Obviously, we're awesome, so...

08:46.859 --> 08:48.904
No, I mean, yeah. This place is great.

08:48.928 --> 08:51.304
I just don't think this place
is for me, though.

08:51.329 --> 08:52.539
Good meeting you.

08:52.563 --> 08:55.342
Whoa, wait, whoa.
What do you mean not for you?

08:55.366 --> 08:57.678
You may not know this, but 19 is, like...

08:57.702 --> 08:59.380
Legendary. I know.

08:59.404 --> 09:01.849
I'm just trying to be realistic here.

09:01.873 --> 09:05.419
The guys in my class, uh,
they're... they're so good.

09:05.443 --> 09:07.821
Everyone gets a little
intimidated during training.

09:07.845 --> 09:11.258
But if you want to be the best,
you got to...

09:11.282 --> 09:13.451
You got to play with the best.

09:13.478 --> 09:15.734
Come on. I am giving you a real tour.

09:16.853 --> 09:18.526
You know you're just distracting
yourself with more work

09:18.550 --> 09:20.094
so you don't have to go deal
with your dad.

09:20.118 --> 09:21.162
No.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.564
I am going to inspire a fresh, young mind

09:23.588 --> 09:27.615
to embrace her fierce inner
bad-ass competitor self.

09:28.493 --> 09:30.326
So I don't have to go deal with my dad.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.477
Okay.

09:33.501 --> 09:35.379
Well, motion's okay.

09:35.403 --> 09:36.981
No broken bones or deformities.

09:37.005 --> 09:38.504
You are a bit warm.

09:43.178 --> 09:45.012
Yeah, your temp's a bit elevated.

09:45.037 --> 09:46.414
That's actually kind of normal for me.

09:46.438 --> 09:48.038
I usually run a little bit hot.

09:49.942 --> 09:51.453
Well, gonna ice the elbow

09:51.477 --> 09:52.988
and have a doctor take a look
once we're out of here.

09:54.179 --> 09:55.557
How long has he had this cough?

09:55.581 --> 09:57.025
A few days, I... I think?

09:57.049 --> 10:00.695
Any recent respiratory issues?
Infections, pneumonia?

10:00.719 --> 10:03.465
I'm not really sure. Um, I mean, maybe.

10:03.489 --> 10:05.066
Any allergies?

10:05.543 --> 10:07.844
I... I-I don't know.

10:08.756 --> 10:09.833
Sorry for the delay.

10:09.857 --> 10:11.301
Hey, can I ask you something?

10:11.325 --> 10:12.736
That guy you were just checking out,

10:12.760 --> 10:14.271
did you learn anything about him?

10:14.295 --> 10:16.473
You know, where he's been, what he does?

10:16.931 --> 10:18.375
Oh, no. Sorry.

10:18.399 --> 10:20.477
I can't get a read on him exactly.

10:20.501 --> 10:23.337
Did you maybe notice if he
was wearing a wedding ring?

10:24.672 --> 10:27.084
Breath sounds are decreased,
and he's got a fever.

10:27.108 --> 10:28.318
What was the last thing he ate?

10:29.410 --> 10:30.520
Oh, my God.

10:30.544 --> 10:33.423
Are you okay? Is he okay? What is that?

10:33.447 --> 10:34.758
U-Um...

10:35.075 --> 10:36.786
I'm not sure, um...

10:36.811 --> 10:38.188
A little more info might help.

10:38.212 --> 10:39.556
Do you mind telling me where
you flew in from today?

10:39.580 --> 10:41.759
Uh, Bashran. It... It's,
uh, in the Middle East. Why?

10:41.783 --> 10:43.527
Um, let me just, um, quickly
take off my gloves,

10:43.551 --> 10:45.729
and I'll do a more detailed exam.

10:50.825 --> 10:51.902
Are you okay?

10:51.926 --> 10:54.672
No, and no one on this train is.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.011
I think we're dealing
with a contagious disease

10:57.036 --> 10:58.580
right here in this car.

10:58.604 --> 11:00.348
We need to go into a lockdown
immediately.

11:00.372 --> 11:02.617
Starting right now,
no one gets off this train.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

11:14.775 --> 11:18.690
I repeat, possible contagious
disease on scene. Please advise.

11:18.715 --> 11:21.151
Copy, 19. Contacting CDC

11:21.191 --> 11:22.368
and State Health Department now.

11:22.392 --> 11:23.703
Stand by.

11:23.727 --> 11:25.905
You want to quarantine this car
because of a-a little blood?

11:25.929 --> 11:27.306
Yeah, and a trip to Bashran.

11:27.330 --> 11:28.841
The CDC has been issuing travel alerts

11:28.865 --> 11:29.942
for that country all week

11:29.966 --> 11:31.381
because of some kind of epidemic.

11:31.405 --> 11:33.646
This is Dr. Mukerji with the CDC.

11:33.670 --> 11:34.840
I need you to listen carefully.

11:34.864 --> 11:37.454
There's been a serious outbreak
of bird flu in Bashran.

11:37.455 --> 11:39.367
We're concerned a new strain
may have emerged there.

11:39.391 --> 11:41.602
Could be more airborne
and far more contagious.

11:41.626 --> 11:43.237
A CDC and hazmat team is en route

11:43.261 --> 11:45.206
and should arrive in less
than 30 minutes.

11:45.230 --> 11:48.309
You must keep the quarantine
in effect until then.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.377
Understood?

11:49.401 --> 11:51.425
- Copy.
- Bird flu.

11:52.704 --> 11:55.216
- Damn.
- A newer, deadlier version, apparently.

12:05.817 --> 12:07.428
That kid's blood got on you.

12:07.452 --> 12:10.197
Yeah, I've been exposed. So have you.

12:10.221 --> 12:12.700
And if the CDC is right
and it's a more airborne strain,

12:12.724 --> 12:13.801
everyone here has.

12:13.825 --> 12:14.969
We need to kill the A.C.

12:14.993 --> 12:16.392
Keep it in this car.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.040
The kid's not the only one who's sick.

12:20.064 --> 12:22.009
Another passenger,
he was on the same flight

12:22.033 --> 12:23.811
coming from the same country.

12:23.835 --> 12:25.112
And he's got a fever.

12:25.136 --> 12:27.515
Okay, okay. So, we have
two known patients.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.116
We're cut off from the Aid Car.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.885
Our patient masks have been contaminated.

12:30.909 --> 12:32.592
All we have is what's in these kits.

12:33.178 --> 12:34.722
Hey, my... my son
is still coughing up blood.

12:34.746 --> 12:35.823
Shouldn't we be taking
him to the hospital

12:35.847 --> 12:37.691
by now or something?

12:37.715 --> 12:39.182
Sir, we need to talk to you
about your son.

12:42.253 --> 12:44.231
I can't believe you talked me into this.

12:44.255 --> 12:46.167
You just stroll in here
and ask me to do checks

12:46.191 --> 12:48.469
on all these people interested
in buying your house?

12:48.493 --> 12:49.537
I could get in real trouble.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.671
I'm not saying that I wouldn't

12:50.695 --> 12:52.206
sell to someone with a criminal record.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.574
I'm just saying I'd like to know

12:53.598 --> 12:55.910
that's the decision I'm making,
eyes wide open.

12:55.934 --> 12:58.245
Well, it's a complete invasion
of these people's privacy.

12:58.269 --> 12:59.346
It's your neighborhood, too.

12:59.370 --> 13:00.514
You really want to live across the street

13:00.538 --> 13:02.383
from a potential serial killer?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.006
Will they keep the yard clean?

13:05.043 --> 13:06.253
Hey, remember that time

13:06.277 --> 13:08.522
I had to skip
my own daughter's graduation

13:08.546 --> 13:10.246
just to bail you out of jail?

13:12.550 --> 13:13.649
Next name.

13:14.686 --> 13:17.331
And this is the Beanery.

13:17.355 --> 13:20.968
Uh, are you thirsty? We are well stocked.

13:20.992 --> 13:22.369
What... What happened there?

13:22.393 --> 13:25.005
I hurt myself in a drill.
I patched it up myself.

13:25.029 --> 13:27.041
You did a pretty lousy job of it.

13:27.065 --> 13:29.243
Yeah, I'd like to see how well you'd do

13:29.267 --> 13:31.312
with one good arm, gauze,
and a hand mirror.

13:31.336 --> 13:33.481
Why not have somebody at the
Academy patch it up properly?

13:33.505 --> 13:34.682
Uh, let me take a guess.

13:34.706 --> 13:36.650
You didn't want any
of the guys in your class

13:36.674 --> 13:37.807
to see that you got hurt.

13:38.877 --> 13:40.554
Have they been busting your chops?

13:40.578 --> 13:42.256
No, no, it's not like that.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.558
They... They treat me like an equal.

13:44.582 --> 13:46.794
Yeah, but you got to be twice as good

13:46.818 --> 13:48.262
to be respected half as much.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.164
Girl, we've been there.
I just keep screwing up.

13:50.188 --> 13:52.233
Dropping things, not even heavy things.

13:52.257 --> 13:54.301
But I'm working on my own all the time.

13:54.325 --> 13:57.271
More push-ups, more muscle
training, more everything.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.406
But I just don't think I'm improving.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.275
We know what you need.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.343
Rice.

14:02.367 --> 14:03.511
Rice?

14:03.535 --> 14:04.979
- Rice.
- Rice.

14:05.003 --> 14:08.215
Bird flu? Are... Are you sure?

14:08.239 --> 14:09.283
The CDC's on their way.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.451
They have medicines,

14:10.475 --> 14:12.386
vaccines, rapid blood tests.

14:12.410 --> 14:13.454
For now, the best thing you can do

14:13.478 --> 14:15.289
is keep Will calm and comfortable.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.857
And if his symptoms change in any way,

14:16.881 --> 14:18.739
we need to know immediately.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.731
Guess it's time to bite the bullet.

14:27.755 --> 14:31.869
Yep. Can't keep the quarantine
a secret, so... good luck.

14:31.894 --> 14:33.505
Whoa, me good luck? You good luck.

14:33.529 --> 14:35.140
- You're telling them, too.
- You wanted to lead.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.242
Which allows me to delegate
and share responsibility,

14:37.266 --> 14:38.510
which I'm planning to do.

14:38.534 --> 14:40.862
I'm a benevolent leader. I share.

14:40.887 --> 14:42.031
Well, you better share quick,

14:42.055 --> 14:43.733
because your people are getting restless.

14:47.427 --> 14:48.571
Hey, everyone.

14:48.595 --> 14:50.561
We just wanted to update you
on what's going on.

14:50.586 --> 14:52.230
Are we getting off this thing
anytime soon?

14:52.254 --> 14:54.132
And why is it so freaking hot in here?

14:54.156 --> 14:55.567
We have a situation.

14:55.591 --> 14:58.136
It's possible that there
is a communicable disease

14:58.160 --> 14:59.548
in this train car.

14:59.572 --> 15:01.565
So, just to be extra cautious,

15:01.590 --> 15:04.169
we've been asked by the CDC
to quarantine this car.

15:04.193 --> 15:07.005
That means nobody gets on.
Nobody gets off.

15:07.029 --> 15:09.274
Oh, my God. Is it Ebola? I feel dizzy.

15:09.298 --> 15:10.408
It's not Ebola.

15:10.432 --> 15:12.911
- Then what is it?
- Ma'am, let's sit you down.

15:12.935 --> 15:15.339
Bird flu. Possibly.

15:15.406 --> 15:17.584
Bird flu?! I'm not a bird!

15:17.608 --> 15:18.919
It's not even that big a deal.

15:18.943 --> 15:21.588
Oh, no! The fatality rate's
as high as 60%.

15:21.612 --> 15:23.690
Bing, bang, boom, new virus, pandemic.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.692
- We all die.
- Spanish flu, look it up.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.961
- Okay.
- Oh, my God. Is that for real?

15:27.985 --> 15:29.630
Wait, we... we could die?

15:29.654 --> 15:31.031
It's that kid, isn't it?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.516
He brought it on this train

15:32.540 --> 15:34.007
with the... the coughing and the blood.

15:34.031 --> 15:35.698
Is that true?

15:35.723 --> 15:36.780
It... It's okay, buddy.
Don't listen to him.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.316
You are gonna be just fine.

15:38.340 --> 15:40.051
Wait, you already knew about this?
What the hell?

15:40.075 --> 15:42.286
- Buddy, please, you have to...
- Stop calling me that.

15:42.310 --> 15:43.788
I haven't been anywhere near this kid.

15:43.812 --> 15:44.956
I will sue your ass

15:44.980 --> 15:47.403
if you try to keep me against my will.

15:47.428 --> 15:49.139
Everyone on this train
is a plaintiff now.

15:49.163 --> 15:51.175
Sir, calm down.
Panic's not gonna help anybody.

15:51.199 --> 15:52.676
Screw that! I'm not waiting.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.478
I don't feel sick. Does anyone else?

15:54.502 --> 15:56.013
- I don't feel sick.
- No, I'm fine.

15:56.037 --> 15:58.349
And maybe being stuck in a metal can

15:58.373 --> 16:00.451
with some stupid kid barfing up blood

16:00.475 --> 16:01.719
is what's gonna get us all sick.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.187
Don't talk about my boy like that!

16:03.211 --> 16:04.355
Oh, Patient Zero?

16:04.379 --> 16:06.056
We should listen to the paramedics.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.057
We're here to help you, guys.

16:07.081 --> 16:08.392
Shut it, Rent-A-Cop.

16:08.416 --> 16:09.827
I'm getting the hell out of here.

16:09.851 --> 16:11.262
I think we should all
get the hell out of here.

16:11.286 --> 16:12.563
Who's with me?

16:12.587 --> 16:14.598
- Yeah, Let's go.
- Let's go.

16:14.622 --> 16:16.133
Everybody, go back to your seats.

16:16.157 --> 16:18.068
- We have rights.
- Sir, I need you to calm down.

16:18.092 --> 16:20.804
Yeah, you can't keep us here.

16:24.145 --> 16:28.171
Everyone needs to back up.
Get out of our way.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.407
Hey!

16:30.431 --> 16:32.176
Listen to me!

16:32.200 --> 16:35.530
You want to pry that door open
and get off the train,

16:35.555 --> 16:36.632
we probably can't stop you.

16:36.657 --> 16:38.001
There are more of you than us.

16:38.025 --> 16:40.704
But there is no "us" versus you.

16:40.728 --> 16:43.407
If there is a contagion on this train,

16:43.431 --> 16:46.532
my partner and I have been
exposed to it, too.

16:46.557 --> 16:48.301
We are all in this together.

16:48.325 --> 16:50.871
Gibson and I, we want
to stay on the train.

16:50.895 --> 16:53.840
We want to wait for the CDC. Know why?

16:53.864 --> 16:56.266
We don't want to bring whatever this is

16:56.291 --> 16:58.970
home to our families,
our loved ones, our friends.

16:58.995 --> 17:02.741
We don't want to unwittingly
infect anybody else.

17:02.765 --> 17:05.010
If you really care about
the people in your lives,

17:05.330 --> 17:06.575
you will wait this out.

17:06.598 --> 17:09.478
And if not, well, the door is there.

17:09.502 --> 17:11.814
Like I said, we can't stop you.

17:34.311 --> 17:36.156
Huh. Who would've thought
that the gentleman

17:36.180 --> 17:38.791
with the complex tattoo of a
snake skull eating a human skull

17:38.815 --> 17:40.582
would be up to his neck
in credit card debt.

17:41.752 --> 17:43.730
No, not this one. She has too many cats.

17:43.754 --> 17:45.932
She'll probably "Grey Gardens" my house.

17:45.956 --> 17:47.133
How do you know she has cats?

17:47.157 --> 17:48.668
Oh, she has cats.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.104
Next up, Shane Robinson.

17:51.128 --> 17:53.285
Now, see, here's a contender.

17:53.310 --> 17:54.354
Excellent posture.

17:54.378 --> 17:55.589
This one screams excellent credit

17:55.613 --> 17:56.990
and pre-approved for a loan.

17:57.014 --> 17:59.359
- I think I know him.
- So he's a cop? Cops are good guys.

17:59.383 --> 18:00.660
Present company excluded, of course.

18:00.684 --> 18:01.792
He's not a cop.

18:01.816 --> 18:03.269
Brought him in for line-ups, car theft.

18:03.294 --> 18:04.605
We've never gotten a positive ID.

18:04.630 --> 18:05.774
Business must be good if he's buying

18:05.798 --> 18:07.275
in our neighborhood, though.

18:17.192 --> 18:19.304
I still can't quite get past the fact

18:19.328 --> 18:22.807
that we are spending our day off
with Bizarro Sullivan.

18:22.831 --> 18:23.908
I mean, look at him over there.

18:23.932 --> 18:25.910
He's trying to make actual small talk.

18:25.934 --> 18:29.180
Yeah, last shift, I repaired
a car engine with him.

18:29.204 --> 18:30.466
Today I'm painting a house.

18:30.490 --> 18:32.750
I can't get a read on the guy anymore.

18:32.774 --> 18:35.086
- You told him yet?
- Hm?

18:35.110 --> 18:36.897
That he may lose you to Medic One?

18:36.922 --> 18:38.700
- Oh, that's a long way off.
- Mnh-mnh.

18:38.724 --> 18:39.810
You know, if I even go out for it.

18:39.834 --> 18:41.069
I mean, I want to.

18:41.093 --> 18:42.437
And there's an orientation
coming up I want to check out,

18:42.461 --> 18:45.740
but, I mean, Sullivan already
thinks I'm a tourist.

18:46.221 --> 18:47.999
You know, I don't...
I don't want to tell him

18:48.023 --> 18:50.190
he's kind of right until
I absolutely have to.

18:51.626 --> 18:53.538
What about you and Gibson?

18:53.562 --> 18:55.239
You started talking to him yet?

18:55.263 --> 18:58.543
I mean, he talked, all right.
Just not to me.

18:58.567 --> 18:59.977
And now I'm the one who'd just as soon

19:00.001 --> 19:01.679
not talk to him right now, so...

19:02.938 --> 19:06.110
That's just a long story for another day.

19:08.243 --> 19:10.688
Well, I'm sick, aren't I?

19:10.712 --> 19:13.233
I can tell. My fever's high.

19:13.258 --> 19:14.402
It's getting higher.

19:14.426 --> 19:15.670
Is this really fatal?

19:15.694 --> 19:18.907
Is there anything you can do
to... improve my chances?

19:18.931 --> 19:21.665
I, uh... I wish I had better
answers for you.

19:25.070 --> 19:26.447
Yeah, me too.

19:31.677 --> 19:33.411
Are we gonna be stuck here much longer?

19:33.435 --> 19:35.055
We're trying to get you
home soon, all right?

19:38.399 --> 19:39.843
Hey, buddy.

19:39.867 --> 19:41.211
Want some water?

19:41.235 --> 19:42.612
It's getting a little hot in here.

19:42.636 --> 19:44.203
My stomach hurts.

19:45.639 --> 19:48.185
Okay, well, maybe... maybe
this'll make you feel better.

19:48.209 --> 19:49.419
You're just making things worse.

19:49.443 --> 19:52.022
Will, bud, I'm really trying here,

19:52.046 --> 19:53.123
so if you could just...

19:53.147 --> 19:55.125
No! I can't. Don't tell me what to do.

19:55.149 --> 19:56.793
This isn't about a video game.
You're sick!

19:56.817 --> 19:59.011
- You make everything worse.
- I'm trying to help!

19:59.035 --> 20:03.288
Okay, let's just... just
take a breath, all right?

20:08.095 --> 20:09.892
I-I shouldn't have snapped like that.

20:09.916 --> 20:12.576
It's a high-pressure situation, right?

20:12.600 --> 20:15.512
Let's do a quick work-up on you, too.

20:17.740 --> 20:20.418
I haven't seen a lot of Will,
for a while.

20:20.442 --> 20:22.020
I mean, his mom and I...

20:22.044 --> 20:24.189
We were just so young when he was born.

20:24.213 --> 20:26.562
Basically kids having a kid.

20:26.587 --> 20:28.431
But last year, she took him
all the way to Bashran.

20:28.455 --> 20:30.066
She's an aid worker.

20:30.090 --> 20:32.368
Weekend visits weren't
exactly convenient.

20:33.744 --> 20:35.004
She got called to an area
that wasn't safe,

20:35.028 --> 20:36.706
so I got to take Will for a while.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.541
I was... I was so excited, you know?

20:38.565 --> 20:40.213
I-I-I've missed the hell out of him.

20:40.237 --> 20:42.349
We... We were best buds
when he was little.

20:42.374 --> 20:43.584
Your pulse is high.

20:43.608 --> 20:44.652
Your temperature's normal,

20:44.676 --> 20:46.320
but I want to keep an eye on you, okay?

20:46.344 --> 20:48.645
Will's gonna be okay, right?

20:50.230 --> 20:51.630
You think he'll be okay?

20:52.866 --> 20:54.311
You know, the CDC will be here soon.

20:54.335 --> 20:56.046
They're gonna have everything he needs...

20:56.070 --> 20:57.948
you know, supportive therapies,
antivirals...

20:57.972 --> 20:58.982
Okay, you know, I've noticed

20:59.006 --> 21:00.417
that when I ask you that question,

21:00.441 --> 21:04.421
you never actually say,
"Yeah, he'll be fine."

21:04.445 --> 21:07.257
Is that because you're
not allowed to say it

21:07.281 --> 21:09.543
or because you think it's not true?

21:17.090 --> 21:18.156
I see.

21:19.468 --> 21:20.911
I see.

21:21.537 --> 21:22.780
You know, sir, you were right.

21:22.804 --> 21:26.017
This is going much more
smoothly with you here.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.452
Glad to hear, Montgomery.

21:28.710 --> 21:30.881
You know, I like your place, by the way.

21:30.905 --> 21:33.173
- It's got good bones.
- Thank you.

21:36.652 --> 21:38.730
Is that you and your husband?

21:38.754 --> 21:40.321
He was a firefighter?

21:40.345 --> 21:41.578
He was.

21:42.115 --> 21:43.547
You lost him on the job, huh?

21:43.571 --> 21:45.404
I did.

21:47.308 --> 21:50.107
You and I, we got more
in common than you think.

21:52.246 --> 21:54.191
We're survivors.

21:54.215 --> 21:57.442
Not just surviving our own
near-death experiences,

21:57.466 --> 21:59.463
but surviving...

22:00.050 --> 22:02.751
the loss of a spouse.

22:04.221 --> 22:06.366
I lost my wife.

22:06.390 --> 22:09.269
A while back, now.

22:09.293 --> 22:11.571
Doesn't really matter
how much time has passed.

22:11.595 --> 22:15.030
You never really get over
something like that, do you?

22:16.525 --> 22:18.892
Well, you have the right idea here.

22:19.862 --> 22:22.362
It's a great way to
jump-start your new chapter.

22:24.712 --> 22:26.345
Not an easy thing to do.

22:28.504 --> 22:30.348
Thank you, sir.

22:30.768 --> 22:32.112
Gibson, can I get a minute?

22:32.137 --> 22:33.515
We should do a quick inventory
on supplies,

22:33.539 --> 22:34.985
see what we have left.

22:38.777 --> 22:40.321
I see you checking up on my patients

22:40.345 --> 22:42.223
the minute I leave them.

22:42.247 --> 22:43.891
An extra set of eyes can't hurt,

22:43.927 --> 22:45.238
especially when things get tense.

22:45.262 --> 22:47.206
I had that under control before.

22:47.230 --> 22:49.175
That thing with the crowd.
I didn't need you to step in.

22:49.199 --> 22:51.043
Just trying to lend a hand.

22:51.067 --> 22:52.545
We're low on gauze, looks like.
And ibuprofen.

22:52.569 --> 22:53.713
You didn't want me to run the call.

22:53.737 --> 22:55.737
You're double-checking my work.
What gives?

22:58.742 --> 23:00.275
Okay.

23:02.891 --> 23:04.758
I'm not sure you're ready to be back yet.

23:06.411 --> 23:07.922
I did the work. The therapy helped.

23:07.946 --> 23:09.456
Did it? You're still not sleeping well.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.125
You haven't made up with Dean.
You're short-tempered...

23:11.149 --> 23:12.330
So you think you know better

23:12.354 --> 23:13.727
than my shrink or the department?

23:13.751 --> 23:15.462
I think you convinced everyone
you were all good

23:15.486 --> 23:16.626
by checking whatever boxes you had to

23:16.650 --> 23:17.885
to get back on duty.

23:17.909 --> 23:18.932
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

23:18.956 --> 23:20.234
No? That's what I did.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.844
I won gold with an ankle sprain.

23:21.869 --> 23:23.747
You know how I got on
the track with an injury?

23:23.771 --> 23:25.281
I told my coach I was fine.

23:25.305 --> 23:27.055
I told the doctors I was fine.

23:27.079 --> 23:28.767
I told my parents and physical therapist

23:28.799 --> 23:29.868
I was fine.

23:29.893 --> 23:32.638
I convinced myself I was fine.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.774
That's you. We're way different.

23:34.798 --> 23:36.409
Are you telling me that not every minute,

23:36.433 --> 23:37.643
every second you were benched,

23:37.667 --> 23:39.345
you weren't itching
to get back in the game

23:39.369 --> 23:40.913
so bad that it hurt?

23:46.543 --> 23:47.691
That's what I thought.

23:51.247 --> 23:52.591
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my Gosh.

23:53.803 --> 23:56.328
Oh, my God! Help! Please!

23:56.352 --> 23:58.230
- Help him!
- Oh, my God.

24:03.072 --> 24:04.650
He's in acute respiratory distress.

24:04.674 --> 24:05.751
Pulse is thready.

24:05.775 --> 24:07.459
Lack of oxygen is affecting his heart.

24:07.484 --> 24:08.728
- I need a...
- Life Pack.

24:08.752 --> 24:09.962
- I need a...
- Bag.

24:13.056 --> 24:15.001
He's dehydrated. He needs an I.V.

24:15.025 --> 24:16.302
It's our only one.

24:20.096 --> 24:21.374
Looks like he has an irregular heartbeat.

24:21.398 --> 24:23.585
- Please, save him!
- We're doing everything we can.

24:23.610 --> 24:24.921
He needs a shot of adenosine.

24:24.945 --> 24:26.322
It's on the Aid Car with
the rest of the beta blockers

24:26.346 --> 24:27.523
and anti-arrhythmics.

24:27.547 --> 24:28.958
What about a painkiller?

24:28.982 --> 24:31.094
- Lidocaine can...
- Fix arrhythmias, too. Good thinking!

24:31.118 --> 24:32.617
Hold that.

24:39.226 --> 24:40.570
Normal rhythm.

24:40.594 --> 24:42.293
And he's breathing on his own.

24:43.739 --> 24:45.141
Wow.

24:45.165 --> 24:48.994
You two were, like, awesome.

25:15.082 --> 25:16.960
When, a month ago,
you couldn't move your legs

25:16.984 --> 25:19.562
and a song comes on that makes
you want to move,

25:19.586 --> 25:21.664
you're a damn fool if you don't move.

25:57.266 --> 25:59.935
What you need is a
different kind of strength.

25:59.935 --> 26:02.013
This is surprisingly hard.

26:02.037 --> 26:03.281
Grip strength's essential.

26:03.305 --> 26:04.649
So, what else you got?

26:04.673 --> 26:06.384
I mean, you clearly have insider tips.

26:06.408 --> 26:08.152
You're gonna want to
distinguish yourself.

26:08.176 --> 26:10.354
Me? I read smoke.

26:10.378 --> 26:11.622
I kick ass.

26:11.646 --> 26:14.146
She can also regulate her O2 intake

26:14.171 --> 26:15.515
better than anyone I've ever met.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.684
Is there really nobody

26:16.708 --> 26:18.586
passing this stuff on to you
at the Academy?

26:18.610 --> 26:20.460
Are you kidding? No.

26:22.647 --> 26:24.258
You know, what's funny is, um,

26:24.282 --> 26:26.394
I never even thought about
becoming a firefighter.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.628
What changed your mind?

26:27.652 --> 26:29.497
Living in a windowless cubicle,

26:29.521 --> 26:31.666
writing mindless code for dating apps.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.729
Until the building
where I worked caught fire

26:34.754 --> 26:37.066
a few months back, and, you know,

26:37.090 --> 26:39.702
seeing the firefighters running upstairs

26:39.726 --> 26:41.637
while I was running down...

26:41.661 --> 26:45.674
All I know is, I wanted to be
the one heading in, not out.

26:46.099 --> 26:47.810
Applied to the Academy the next day.

26:47.834 --> 26:49.312
Was it a big fire, or...?

26:49.336 --> 26:51.381
Oh, yeah, the big
Barclay Skyscraper downtown.

26:51.405 --> 26:53.416
- Oh, wow. Okay.
- We were there, too.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.351
That was you?

26:55.375 --> 26:58.652
You guys inspired me
to change my whole life.

26:58.677 --> 27:00.121
And now I'm here.

27:00.145 --> 27:01.556
Like, I've come back to you for help

27:01.580 --> 27:02.757
without even realizing it.

27:02.781 --> 27:03.791
Aww.

27:03.815 --> 27:05.193
We're like her firefighter Sherpas,

27:05.217 --> 27:06.294
guiding her to her destiny.

27:06.318 --> 27:07.962
It's really not like that at all.

27:07.986 --> 27:09.297
No, we are her Yoda.

27:09.321 --> 27:10.998
She's is our Padawan.

27:11.292 --> 27:12.503
I don't know what that means,

27:12.527 --> 27:13.971
and I don't know that I want to be that.

27:13.995 --> 27:17.208
Just keep opening and closing
your fist till it burns.

27:17.232 --> 27:20.066
Good. Be at one with your rice.

27:23.538 --> 27:25.182
He's stable for now.

27:25.206 --> 27:27.387
Sorry. I don't mean to hover.

27:27.412 --> 27:29.490
I'm nervous about this.

27:29.514 --> 27:30.925
- You're a couple?
- Oh, no.

27:30.949 --> 27:34.128
Neil and I ride the same
subway train every morning.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.465
He gives up his seat any time
it's crowded, which is nice.

27:37.888 --> 27:40.033
I never said a word to him, not one.

27:40.057 --> 27:41.601
Sometimes I feel like he's about

27:41.625 --> 27:43.959
to say something to me, but he doesn't.

27:45.229 --> 27:48.374
And then, one day, he just
stopped being on the train.

27:48.398 --> 27:51.711
And the next day, too, and the next.

27:51.735 --> 27:54.848
That's when I realized...

27:54.872 --> 27:57.224
I missed him being around.

27:59.891 --> 28:01.101
But he's back today.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.070
And I told myself, if he ever comes back,

28:03.094 --> 28:04.405
I'm gonna work up the nerve to ask

28:04.429 --> 28:06.707
if he wants to maybe grab dinner.

28:06.731 --> 28:08.808
No, a drink. Coffee!

28:08.855 --> 28:10.722
I don't know, something.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.492
But now...

28:16.029 --> 28:18.507
You probably think it's dumb or crazy

28:18.531 --> 28:20.843
to feel pulled towards some person

28:20.867 --> 28:23.034
I barely even know like this.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.083
It's hard to explain.

28:33.947 --> 28:35.524
Give me your hand.

28:41.254 --> 28:43.365
Count the heartbeats.

28:43.954 --> 28:45.499
Just to make sure the pack is working.

28:45.523 --> 28:47.067
Concentrate on that.

28:47.091 --> 28:48.735
Okay.

28:55.371 --> 28:57.817
Well, I can't imagine what our
neighborhood's gonna be like

28:57.841 --> 28:59.552
without a Herrera on the block.

28:59.576 --> 29:01.687
Who's gonna make six-alarm chili
for block parties

29:01.711 --> 29:03.455
or put up creepy zombie firefighters

29:03.479 --> 29:04.957
on their front lawn for Halloween?

29:04.981 --> 29:06.659
I'll give you all my Halloween stuff.

29:06.683 --> 29:09.762
But the chili recipe dies with me.

29:09.786 --> 29:12.464
Ugh. Just can't believe you're leaving.

29:12.488 --> 29:15.634
I've gotten too
comfortable in that house.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.895
Being Captain again made me realize

29:17.919 --> 29:19.897
that I need to move forward,
not backwards.

29:19.921 --> 29:22.333
I... I want to grow. I want challenges.

29:22.357 --> 29:25.869
And that house, it's just
an old, comfy blanket.

29:25.893 --> 29:27.438
What's wrong with a comfy blanket?

29:27.462 --> 29:29.707
Nothing. If that's what you want.

29:29.731 --> 29:32.611
It's just that
I've outgrown mine, is all.

29:35.136 --> 29:36.679
Ow, it hurts when I breathe now.

29:36.704 --> 29:37.813
It's okay, buddy. I'm here.

29:39.106 --> 29:40.384
Will? Will, Will, Will!

29:40.408 --> 29:41.885
Bishop!

29:48.382 --> 29:50.427
Bag him. His pulse is rapid and weak.

29:55.523 --> 29:56.633
His gums look cyanotic.

29:56.657 --> 29:58.602
His B.P. is dropping.

29:58.626 --> 30:00.370
What the hell are you doing?

30:00.394 --> 30:02.039
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, don't do that!

30:02.063 --> 30:03.773
- The CDC's almost here!
- Hey, screw you!

30:03.798 --> 30:05.409
I'm tired of living in this metal coffin.

30:05.433 --> 30:07.444
Gibson, focus!
This kid is going into shock.

30:07.468 --> 30:08.645
I'm getting the hell out of here.

30:12.873 --> 30:15.585
It's okay. I stopped him.

30:15.609 --> 30:16.720
I did the right thing, right?

30:16.744 --> 30:19.523
Right?

30:19.547 --> 30:20.791
Oh, God. Oh, no.

30:20.815 --> 30:22.160
Is he still supposed to be doing that?

30:24.130 --> 30:25.872
- Pushing epi.
- We got another person down!

30:25.896 --> 30:27.343
- We got to stabilize Will first.
- Hey, Kenneth.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.921
Hey. I need you to just relax, okay?

30:29.946 --> 30:31.556
Can you tell me anything else
about that guy's condition?

30:31.580 --> 30:33.690
- Is he breathing?
- Uh, I-I-I don't know.

30:33.714 --> 30:35.097
- Maybe?
- Okay, pulse is stronger.

30:35.122 --> 30:36.204
Epi's working for now.

30:36.228 --> 30:37.335
- Take over.
- Yeah.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.688
Hey, what are you doing?
Doesn't he need that?

30:51.712 --> 30:53.144
This guy needs it way more.

30:56.917 --> 30:58.428
Damn it. I got ventricular
arrhythmia over here.

30:58.452 --> 31:00.474
- I need more lidocaine!
- No, I gave it all to Neil.

31:00.498 --> 31:01.950
The rest is on the Aid Car.

31:03.744 --> 31:05.322
Okay. K-Kenneth, I need your help.

31:05.346 --> 31:07.091
Uh, I already messed this guy up.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.348
What if I make it worse?

31:08.373 --> 31:09.692
No, you're not gonna make
it worse, okay, Kenneth?

31:09.716 --> 31:11.482
It's time. I'm calling
you in off the bench.

31:11.507 --> 31:12.885
- Are you ready?
- All right, yeah. Yeah!

31:12.909 --> 31:14.553
Okay, good. I need you
to watch this monitor.

31:14.577 --> 31:16.288
Tell me if anything beeps
or if the rhythm changes.

31:16.312 --> 31:18.023
Just remember, waves good, flatline bad.

31:18.047 --> 31:19.625
Very bad. Say it back to me.

31:19.649 --> 31:21.493
Waves good, flatline bad.
Waves good, flatline bad.

31:21.517 --> 31:22.795
What's going on with my son? Is he okay?

31:22.819 --> 31:24.672
We're giving him medicine
to keep his heart pumping.

31:24.697 --> 31:26.574
- So, he's okay, right?
- His B.P.'s still dropping.

31:26.598 --> 31:27.676
No. No, no...

31:27.700 --> 31:29.144
That guy's gonna die without meds.

31:29.168 --> 31:30.545
We might need to risk
a run to the Aid Car.

31:30.569 --> 31:31.681
We can't violate the quarantine.

31:31.705 --> 31:32.732
There's got to be another solution.

31:32.756 --> 31:34.049
I'm open to anything.

31:34.073 --> 31:35.383
Okay.

31:35.724 --> 31:37.335
What if...

31:37.360 --> 31:39.372
What if one of the passengers is
on medication that can help?

31:39.397 --> 31:41.441
I can go and collect all
the passengers' medication.

31:41.465 --> 31:43.310
Maybe someone has something
that can keep Reese going

31:43.334 --> 31:45.212
- until the CDC gets here.
- Yeah, yeah. Go.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.414
If anyone is on any medication,
I need you to take it out

31:47.438 --> 31:50.050
and hold it up, please.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.486
Is... Isn't there
anything we can do for him?

31:52.510 --> 31:54.301
Yeah, just hold this like this.

31:54.325 --> 31:56.456
- Okay.
- Tight seal.

31:56.938 --> 31:59.217
I need an ETA on the CDC.

31:59.242 --> 32:00.953
Copy. We are 10 minutes out.

32:00.977 --> 32:02.099
10 minutes?

32:02.124 --> 32:03.489
H-He can hold on till then.
It's not that long, right?

32:03.513 --> 32:05.327
His B.P.'s dropping too fast.

32:05.351 --> 32:06.944
We need to do something right now!

32:06.968 --> 32:08.912
What do you need? Antibiotics?

32:08.950 --> 32:11.862
Diuretics? Anti-fungal cream?

32:11.886 --> 32:13.497
Ooh, here's some root.

32:13.521 --> 32:15.199
It's amazing. Totally mellows you out.

32:15.223 --> 32:16.367
No. No.

32:16.391 --> 32:17.501
Please, you have to do something.

32:17.525 --> 32:18.569
I... I can't lose my son.

32:18.593 --> 32:19.637
No...

32:19.661 --> 32:21.126
Um... Jack?

32:21.150 --> 32:22.940
Remember when we said waves
good, flatline bad?

32:22.964 --> 32:24.742
Well, flatline. Flatline bad.

32:24.766 --> 32:26.469
Oh, no! Something's wrong with Neil!

32:26.494 --> 32:28.071
I don't think he's breathing anymore!

32:28.095 --> 32:29.506
- Is he gonna die?
- You got to get over here!

32:29.530 --> 32:30.540
You've got to save this guy, please!

32:30.564 --> 32:31.875
Please, he needs you now!

32:31.899 --> 32:33.744
Please, you have to save my son!

32:52.990 --> 32:54.234
All right!

32:54.258 --> 32:55.936
Everyone listen.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.238
If we're gonna save these
people, I need everyone's help.

32:58.262 --> 32:59.806
I know you're scared.

32:59.830 --> 33:01.775
I'm scared, too.

33:01.799 --> 33:04.778
But I need all of you to push that aside.

33:04.802 --> 33:08.615
Because, as of this moment,
you're all firefighters.

33:09.093 --> 33:10.737
And we don't let fear stop us.

33:12.530 --> 33:13.796
All right?

33:21.172 --> 33:22.449
Good.

33:22.473 --> 33:23.517
You.

33:23.541 --> 33:24.718
Go through this kit,

33:25.270 --> 33:26.380
look for another bag

33:26.404 --> 33:27.682
like the one that we used on Neil.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.550
Also something labeled "pocket mask."

33:29.574 --> 33:30.618
I need you to go through it, too,

33:30.642 --> 33:31.752
look for needles, vials,

33:31.776 --> 33:33.521
anything that says dopamine
or dobutamine.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.622
Now, fast.

33:34.646 --> 33:35.756
Kenneth, Sarla.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.858
Do either of you have CPR
or life-saving training?

33:37.882 --> 33:38.859
No.

33:38.883 --> 33:40.461
I was a lifeguard in high school.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.797
Okay, great. Sarla, catch.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.290
Take that mask and do exactly
what I'm doing.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.937
You, watch Neil's chest.

33:46.977 --> 33:48.688
Make sure it rises
every time she squeezes.

33:48.712 --> 33:49.989
Go, now!

33:50.013 --> 33:53.026
Tenney, I didn't have time
to check everyone's meds.

33:53.050 --> 33:54.327
I need you to collect all the bottles

33:54.351 --> 33:55.995
and put 'em in your bag
and bring 'em to me, okay?

33:56.019 --> 33:58.098
Kenneth. Use this mask.

33:58.122 --> 34:00.837
Just form a tight seal around
his mouth and exhale hard.

34:01.091 --> 34:02.902
Come on. Come on.

34:08.599 --> 34:10.179
Okay. Show me the bottles one at a time.

34:11.534 --> 34:12.667
No.

34:12.690 --> 34:14.313
No.

34:14.338 --> 34:15.681
No.

34:15.706 --> 34:18.188
- Ooh, Fomepizole. That's hard to find.
- Tenney.

34:20.231 --> 34:22.042
Finally. Amiodarone.

34:22.065 --> 34:23.610
Take two out!

34:23.634 --> 34:25.414
- I don't think that medicine's in here.
- Damn it!

34:29.481 --> 34:30.725
Okay, can you hear me?

34:30.748 --> 34:32.761
I need you to open your mouth, okay?

34:32.784 --> 34:33.962
Here, give me the pills.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.598
I need to put these under
your tongue, okay?

34:38.556 --> 34:39.967
He's getting too hypovolemic.

34:39.992 --> 34:41.402
We're out of I.V.s.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.338
If we were in a hospital,
it'd take the nurse two seconds

34:43.362 --> 34:45.239
to run down to the blood ba...

34:45.264 --> 34:47.242
Wait, do you know his blood type?

34:47.266 --> 34:48.476
Are you guys the same blood type?

34:48.500 --> 34:50.110
Yeah. H-He's O-negative. I'm O-negative.

34:50.135 --> 34:51.446
Okay, I need you to roll up
both your sleeves.

34:51.469 --> 34:53.370
You're about to become
a walking blood bank.

35:02.418 --> 35:04.950
Okay, hero. Keep your arm
above the I.V. bag.

35:04.975 --> 35:05.985
Sarla, how we doing?

35:06.009 --> 35:08.221
His chest won't rise
when I pump this thing.

35:08.245 --> 35:09.825
Maybe I'm not using it right.

35:09.849 --> 35:12.025
- Bishop, are you free?
- My guy's still in V-tach.

35:12.050 --> 35:13.628
I need a little more time
for the meds to work.

35:13.652 --> 35:15.930
Sarla, I need you to keep trying, okay?

35:15.954 --> 35:17.665
I'll be over in a few seconds
to intubate him,

35:17.689 --> 35:18.935
but he needs air now.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.137
I think this stupid bag

35:20.161 --> 35:21.472
is getting in the way or something.

35:21.496 --> 35:23.829
No, you have to use it.
Neil has a contagious disease.

35:26.534 --> 35:27.733
To hell with it.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.384
Harold...

35:34.408 --> 35:37.421
Now make sure to keep the blood
bag higher than Will.

35:37.867 --> 35:39.244
You think you can give him
air with this, too?

35:39.268 --> 35:40.846
- Yep.
- Good.

35:40.870 --> 35:41.880
Okay.

35:44.674 --> 35:47.119
All right. Great work.
I'll take it from here.

35:48.177 --> 35:49.922
I got a normal sinus rhythm.

35:49.946 --> 35:52.491
Hey, hey. How are you feeling?

35:57.125 --> 35:59.170
I'll... sue...

35:59.194 --> 36:00.326
He's fine.

36:03.565 --> 36:05.461
Neil is stable, too.

36:08.603 --> 36:10.447
I can't believe it.

36:10.471 --> 36:11.982
For a minute there, I thought...

36:14.202 --> 36:15.980
Yeah, me too.

36:24.379 --> 36:26.374
- Will.
- Dad?

36:27.215 --> 36:29.360
Hey. It's okay, buddy.

36:29.384 --> 36:31.328
You're okay.

36:31.352 --> 36:33.323
I'm right here.

36:33.922 --> 36:35.388
I'm not going anywhere.

36:37.025 --> 36:40.404
Bishop, this is Dr. Mukerji.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.775
We're here and setting up
our decontam area

36:42.799 --> 36:44.843
just outside the subway station.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.319
No, don't try to talk.

36:54.343 --> 36:57.122
You have a tube in your throat
to help you breathe.

36:57.146 --> 36:58.557
This is Sarla, by the way.

36:58.581 --> 37:00.159
She saved your life.

37:00.650 --> 37:01.994
I gave you mouth-to-mouth.

37:02.018 --> 37:03.217
Nice to meet you.

37:05.421 --> 37:06.820
Uh, hi.

37:07.590 --> 37:09.414
You know, I thought the hardest
part about bringing him home

37:09.438 --> 37:11.430
would be to figure out
what kind of food he likes now

37:11.454 --> 37:13.505
or what we were gonna talk about.

37:15.437 --> 37:16.947
That stuff may still be hard.

37:16.971 --> 37:18.449
As long as he's around, I'll take it.

37:21.009 --> 37:23.988
We're gonna figure this out.
I know we will.

37:24.012 --> 37:26.624
We just got to take it day by day.

37:30.356 --> 37:32.367
Damn, it feels good
to be out of that metal can.

37:32.391 --> 37:35.203
Even if it means wearing
a decon tent about to get naked.

37:35.227 --> 37:36.910
Worth it. We made it.

37:36.934 --> 37:37.981
We're alive.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.008
Feeling good to be alive right now.

37:40.032 --> 37:41.476
Jack Gibson and Maya Bishop?

37:41.974 --> 37:43.412
I'm Dr. Mukerji.

37:43.726 --> 37:46.471
We have presumptive positive
results for bird flu.

37:46.496 --> 37:48.708
And we've tracked down nearly
every passenger on that flight,

37:48.732 --> 37:50.276
and we're keeping them under observation,

37:50.300 --> 37:52.745
but we're hopeful we've averted
the full-scale outbreak.

37:52.769 --> 37:55.393
Both of your rapid PCRs
came back negative,

37:55.417 --> 37:57.316
so the good news is, you're not infected.

37:57.822 --> 38:00.134
Your patients are on their way
to Grey-Sloan,

38:00.158 --> 38:02.269
and with supportive therapy
and antivirals,

38:02.293 --> 38:04.138
their prognosis is good.

38:04.162 --> 38:05.406
We're just lucky this is a strain

38:05.430 --> 38:06.762
that has a vaccine.

38:07.866 --> 38:09.365
Good work out there today.

38:10.668 --> 38:12.435
Thank you.

38:18.243 --> 38:21.222
We kept a train car

38:21.246 --> 38:25.169
full of angry,
sweaty strangers alive today

38:25.193 --> 38:26.894
under insane circumstances.

38:28.746 --> 38:30.257
Nice work in there today.

38:30.281 --> 38:31.692
And for someone with zero people skills,

38:31.716 --> 38:32.759
that couldn't have been easy.

38:32.783 --> 38:33.794
You know, in Bishop-speak,

38:33.818 --> 38:36.070
that almost sounded like an apology.

38:37.088 --> 38:38.565
Fine.

38:38.589 --> 38:41.435
Yes, I am sorry for
doubting you earlier, Gibson.

38:41.459 --> 38:43.203
You didn't suck today.

38:43.227 --> 38:44.971
You didn't suck either.

38:44.995 --> 38:46.039
Most of the time,

38:46.063 --> 38:47.474
I did do a lot of the heavy lifting.

38:48.031 --> 38:49.330
Hardly.

38:51.715 --> 38:53.115
There was a moment, though.

38:54.438 --> 38:56.916
When all three patients
were crashing at once,

38:56.940 --> 39:00.453
it did feel a bit like
the walls were closing in.

39:00.477 --> 39:02.488
And before my time away,
that would've, um,

39:02.512 --> 39:04.593
triggered me in a bad way, I know that.

39:04.617 --> 39:05.850
But today...

39:07.609 --> 39:09.075
Today I handled it.

39:10.938 --> 39:12.732
I was able to handle it.

39:13.274 --> 39:16.778
I just got to take it day by day.

39:24.455 --> 39:25.599
You know, in Gibson-speak,

39:25.623 --> 39:27.389
that almost sounds like a thank you.

39:30.294 --> 39:32.639
Fine. Even though you were super annoying

39:32.663 --> 39:34.274
and super insensitive...

39:34.298 --> 39:36.643
Thanks.

39:37.146 --> 39:38.423
For looking out, I guess.

39:38.447 --> 39:40.225
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

39:40.249 --> 39:41.626
- What was that?
- You know I got to write you up

39:41.650 --> 39:43.428
for stealing medicine
from civilians, right?

39:45.321 --> 39:46.498
Yeah.

39:53.756 --> 39:55.200
First one's on me.

39:58.194 --> 40:00.472
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

40:00.496 --> 40:02.207
but I actually had fun with
Captain Fire Grinch today.

40:02.231 --> 40:03.342
I know, me too.

40:03.366 --> 40:06.278
- What is happening to us?
- I don't know.

40:06.302 --> 40:09.314
Sometimes you might think
you can contain a spark.

40:15.110 --> 40:16.388
Maybe you should take your own advice.

40:17.613 --> 40:20.325
- Meaning?
- Well, you told Kat over there

40:20.349 --> 40:22.227
that she needed to work on
a different kind of strength

40:22.251 --> 40:23.428
to fix her problem.

40:23.452 --> 40:25.497
Maybe you should do the same.

40:25.521 --> 40:27.704
I know your dad's move

40:27.729 --> 40:29.073
is stirring up all kinds of dust for you.

40:29.097 --> 40:31.075
But isn't that when
people like us gear up

40:31.099 --> 40:33.511
and charge into
the smoky building anyway?

40:33.535 --> 40:35.313
I spent the day with your dad today.

40:35.337 --> 40:36.470
Oh, I heard.

40:36.495 --> 40:38.783
Um, you might want to
get used to the idea

40:38.807 --> 40:40.318
of you losing your childhood home.

40:40.342 --> 40:42.086
Your dad actually
has a couple of pretty via...

40:42.110 --> 40:43.988
Oh, you should meet our Captain!

40:44.012 --> 40:45.390
Come.

40:45.952 --> 40:48.463
Um, this is Kat.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.232
She's a trainee at the Academy,

40:50.256 --> 40:52.134
and I thought you two should meet,

40:52.158 --> 40:54.436
since she is Station 19 material.

40:55.561 --> 40:57.973
Okay, um... Yeah.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.508
Pull up a chair.

40:59.532 --> 41:01.109
I'm so sorry. I just had to.

41:01.133 --> 41:02.077
Yeah.

41:02.101 --> 41:04.313
So, what were you saying again?

41:05.693 --> 41:08.350
Uh, am I your comfy blanket?

41:08.959 --> 41:10.136
What?

41:15.232 --> 41:16.676
What? Oh, my God.

41:18.869 --> 41:21.848
But what if you lose control
of the spark?

41:27.244 --> 41:28.555
Shower boundaries.

41:28.579 --> 41:30.657
Maya? You okay?

41:30.681 --> 41:31.758
Yeah, I'm fine.

41:31.782 --> 41:33.092
CDC cleared me but scrubbed me

41:33.116 --> 41:34.360
with all these weird chemicals,

41:34.384 --> 41:35.995
so I felt I needed a real shower.

41:36.019 --> 41:37.664
Okay. Yeah.

41:37.688 --> 41:39.566
I'll grab you some hot and sour soup

41:39.590 --> 41:40.700
from around the corner.

41:40.724 --> 41:42.035
And then you're telling me everything.

41:42.059 --> 41:43.570
Yeah, everything.

41:43.594 --> 41:46.639
What if that spark
catches fire and erupts?

41:46.663 --> 41:48.474
- All right, be back soon.
- Okay, thanks.

41:53.704 --> 41:55.215
If you're not careful...

41:58.876 --> 42:00.706
You have to go. She'll be back.

42:00.730 --> 42:02.276
Okay.

42:04.181 --> 42:05.358
In a minute.

42:05.382 --> 42:10.493
...it'll burn your whole world down.
