00:49.063 --> 00:53.098
All
of these aspects of myself,

00:53.100 --> 00:59.403
all of these thoughts,
how do we heal them?

00:59.405 --> 01:00.307
How do I unify them?

01:03.377 --> 01:07.282
How do we create the we to an I?

01:11.752 --> 01:16.721
Every evil we
experience in this world

01:16.723 --> 01:19.393
is actually the world in
perfect balance with itself.

01:22.529 --> 01:27.866
I'm only a vessel
for your unfoldment.

01:27.868 --> 01:30.769
I am only here for you.

01:30.771 --> 01:35.107
So when a conflict arises
in me, the universe

01:35.109 --> 01:40.010
then sends a runner to manifest
that conflict in a form

01:40.012 --> 01:47.084
that I can see, to deal
with outside myself,

01:47.086 --> 01:49.389
to create the harmony
that I've lost within me.

01:52.458 --> 02:02.834
But the fear, a fear of not
having, a fear of not knowing,

02:02.836 --> 02:06.804
a fear of being left behind.

02:06.806 --> 02:11.176
The fear, the fear,
the fear, hardly

02:11.178 --> 02:12.380
leaves any room for love.

02:16.182 --> 02:19.483
Love is a reality.

02:19.485 --> 02:20.420
Love is the only reality.

02:23.857 --> 02:31.529
Had I run from it, I run
from the things that heal me,

02:31.531 --> 02:34.766
because I need to feel powerful.

02:34.768 --> 02:36.371
I need to feel validated.

02:38.938 --> 02:44.509
I need to give expression to
these tears that I have inside,

02:44.511 --> 02:45.780
because without them, who am I?

02:49.216 --> 02:50.118
Who am I?

02:53.753 --> 02:54.489
I'm an illusion.

02:58.591 --> 02:59.991
I'm not even here.

03:25.918 --> 03:27.118
Mom?

03:27.120 --> 03:29.921
It's not a
great time, honey.

03:29.923 --> 03:31.989
I'm out with the girls.

03:31.991 --> 03:34.024
I don't know what he wants.

03:34.026 --> 03:34.792
Hang on.

03:34.794 --> 03:36.261
I'm finding out.

03:36.263 --> 03:38.230
Honey, what's the problem?

03:38.232 --> 03:40.130
What happened?

03:40.132 --> 03:41.600
I don't know.

03:41.602 --> 03:42.868
What do you
mean you don't know?

03:42.870 --> 03:44.835
Um, a
friend came over.

03:44.837 --> 03:47.238
What did you
guys, break something?

03:47.240 --> 03:50.107
No.

03:50.109 --> 03:52.646
Mom, just come home, please.

03:55.615 --> 03:56.581
I need help.

04:23.810 --> 04:27.879
We need one another
so that we can

04:27.881 --> 04:31.215
get to that place of balance.

04:31.217 --> 04:35.754
If we knew what balance was,
we would just achieve it.

04:35.756 --> 04:36.056
No.

04:39.025 --> 04:43.662
We have to feel our
way like blind men,

04:43.664 --> 04:48.232
walking in a vast room, looking
for the walls to hang on to,

04:48.234 --> 04:51.872
to feel, so they can
look for a way out.

04:56.943 --> 04:57.244
Mom?

05:04.284 --> 05:07.251
Am I bad?

05:07.253 --> 05:10.254
No.

05:10.256 --> 05:11.256
Of course not, honey.

05:15.929 --> 05:16.931
Why did
this happen then?

05:20.133 --> 05:21.536
I'll explain
when you're older.

05:26.373 --> 05:29.607
You'll listen to them
and do what they say.

05:29.609 --> 05:29.910
OK?

05:33.145 --> 05:36.681
How long
will I be there?

05:36.683 --> 05:39.718
That depends on you.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.187
It's time you took
responsibility for yourself.

05:43.189 --> 05:47.060
You'll have to choose your own
path and follow it to the end.

05:50.229 --> 05:53.163
You have that key
I gave you, right?

05:53.165 --> 05:56.134
Yeah.

05:56.136 --> 05:57.035
That's a good boy.

06:49.121 --> 06:51.456
Welcome to the clinic.

06:51.458 --> 06:54.792
Your treatment awaits you.

06:54.794 --> 07:00.331
Please make yourself at home
and be one with the others.

07:00.333 --> 07:07.037
Breathe in, breathe out.

07:07.039 --> 07:12.410
Close your eyes and
think of your new self,

07:12.412 --> 07:18.883
a self without limits, that
can create new worlds, where

07:18.885 --> 07:22.420
anything is possible.

07:22.422 --> 07:28.826
Breathe in, breathe out.

07:28.828 --> 07:33.997
Breathe in, breathe out.

07:33.999 --> 07:40.739
Your mind exists only in
the form you allow it to.

07:40.741 --> 07:47.145
Breathe in, breathe out.

07:47.147 --> 07:53.751
Breathe in, breathe out.

07:53.753 --> 07:54.518
Breathe in--

09:16.036 --> 09:17.234
Go ahead.

09:17.236 --> 09:19.304
This is your room.

09:19.306 --> 09:21.238
You may unpack if you wish.

09:30.917 --> 09:33.117
The others.

09:33.119 --> 09:34.419
Why are they here?

09:34.421 --> 09:37.421
They are all
on their own journey.

09:37.423 --> 09:38.923
Journeys a lot like yours.

10:32.378 --> 10:33.911
What happens here?

10:33.913 --> 10:36.280
We are here to help.

10:36.282 --> 10:38.916
Once you select a
path, you'll see.

10:44.456 --> 10:45.957
What's that room?

10:45.959 --> 10:47.592
Selection room.

10:47.594 --> 10:51.161
When you are ready you
can select a path there.

10:51.163 --> 10:56.034
Once you make a choice,
the treatment can begin.

10:56.036 --> 10:59.170
Treatment?

10:59.172 --> 11:01.705
Why don't
you get some rest?

11:01.707 --> 11:03.373
You can meet the others later.

11:24.229 --> 11:33.070
I created
an automaton, and then two,

11:33.072 --> 11:42.348
and then four, until I
was surrounded with them.

11:50.389 --> 11:57.428
When I caught that reality,
I could replicate anything

11:57.430 --> 12:10.742
that was already in
existence and call it my own

12:10.744 --> 12:11.445
and feel powerful.

12:18.084 --> 12:22.185
It's almost as if I'm
lost in my own dreams.

13:13.605 --> 13:15.405
Your trainers
will be here soon.

13:50.643 --> 13:52.510
How
can I be your mother

13:52.512 --> 13:53.680
and not feel responsible?

13:56.816 --> 13:58.051
You are my son.

14:03.623 --> 14:07.527
I look in your face and find
no other eyes but my own.

14:15.301 --> 14:17.671
I'd hoped that you would
turn out different.

14:22.609 --> 14:24.478
I wanted you to be perfect.

14:29.449 --> 14:35.486
But I can't help but wonder,
is perfection something

14:35.488 --> 14:36.253
this world needs?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.766
No.

14:49.768 --> 14:51.169
Perfection is horrible.

14:54.641 --> 14:56.607
It will destroy us all.

15:47.226 --> 15:47.660
What happened?

15:51.598 --> 15:52.733
Tell me what's going on.

15:56.369 --> 15:58.535
You have to tell
me what's going on.

15:58.537 --> 15:59.837
I don't know.

15:59.839 --> 16:01.941
We can't help
you unless you open up.

16:05.611 --> 16:08.011
I don't know.

16:08.013 --> 16:09.981
The danger is still real.

16:18.957 --> 16:20.958
Hi.

16:20.960 --> 16:21.659
Were you--

16:21.661 --> 16:22.492
No.

16:22.494 --> 16:23.526
I was just-- um--

16:23.528 --> 16:24.694
Sorry.

16:24.696 --> 16:26.497
I was trying to find my room.

16:26.499 --> 16:27.968
Um, I'm guessing it's this.

16:31.037 --> 16:32.569
What's your name?

16:32.571 --> 16:32.873
Sarah.

16:37.442 --> 16:39.376
Where you from?

16:39.378 --> 16:41.312
Me?

16:41.314 --> 16:46.416
Um, I grew up pretty far away.

16:46.418 --> 16:48.919
Do you feel
out of place here?

16:48.921 --> 16:50.788
No.

16:50.790 --> 16:54.558
I think everyone's
on similar journeys.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.525
What about you?

16:55.527 --> 16:58.828
Where are you from?

16:58.830 --> 17:01.365
Not too far away.

17:01.367 --> 17:03.434
My mom came here
when she was younger

17:03.436 --> 17:10.607
and she thought they
could, um, fix me.

17:10.608 --> 17:11.478
Fix you?

17:14.880 --> 17:18.784
I've been having
these strange visions.

17:21.752 --> 17:24.055
Hm.

17:24.057 --> 17:25.556
Have you made your
selection yet?

17:25.558 --> 17:26.026
Not yet.

17:28.794 --> 17:32.863
What are you waiting
for to start your journey?

17:32.865 --> 17:36.399
I don't know.

17:36.401 --> 17:38.735
You have to evolve
past your own nature.

17:38.737 --> 17:40.037
You have to get
to the next place

17:40.039 --> 17:42.807
if you want to
get along in here.

17:42.809 --> 17:45.376
You're doing that?

17:45.378 --> 17:46.743
Evolving?

17:46.745 --> 17:49.680
Yeah.

17:49.682 --> 17:52.015
Come with me.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.424
When
every space that we see

18:01.426 --> 18:07.464
is empty, there's a
story being played out.

18:07.466 --> 18:14.637
There's a universe unfolding
between two people.

18:14.639 --> 18:16.574
There may be thousands
upon thousands

18:16.576 --> 18:23.813
of realities happening that
they may not be aware of.

18:23.815 --> 18:26.817
I need to make my selection.

18:26.819 --> 18:28.386
OK.

18:28.388 --> 18:29.089
Please hurry.

18:32.157 --> 18:35.425
You
see, for those two people, who

18:35.427 --> 18:37.994
see each other,
they're vibrating

18:37.996 --> 18:48.438
at a specific frequency, one
that allows the other person

18:48.440 --> 18:52.143
to be manifest before them.

18:52.145 --> 18:58.449
But the true process, the one
that brings them together,

18:58.451 --> 18:59.553
is so much more subtle.

19:06.993 --> 19:07.992
Hey.

19:07.994 --> 19:10.560
Check it out.

19:10.562 --> 19:11.928
Girls in outer space.

19:20.138 --> 19:22.940
What's wrong?

19:22.942 --> 19:23.574
Come on.

19:23.576 --> 19:24.942
Tell me.

19:24.944 --> 19:26.577
I can tell you were
thinking about something.

19:26.579 --> 19:33.587
I mean, you look so familiar.

19:38.523 --> 19:39.123
Weird.

19:39.125 --> 19:39.693
You know that?

19:56.042 --> 19:59.242
You're
putting her at risk.

19:59.244 --> 20:00.944
Why are you here?

20:00.946 --> 20:04.248
To fix this, this problem.

20:04.250 --> 20:07.518
Why haven't you
chosen a path then?

20:07.520 --> 20:11.688
Don't you remember what
happened to your girlfriend?

20:11.690 --> 20:12.990
It was like I was--

20:12.992 --> 20:14.191
I was in a dream.

20:14.193 --> 20:15.095
What did you see?

20:19.898 --> 20:21.732
I was terrified.

20:21.734 --> 20:23.533
I had no control.

20:23.535 --> 20:26.703
I-- I couldn't do anything.

20:26.705 --> 20:30.640
It was like I was on a
ride I couldn't get off of.

20:30.642 --> 20:38.147
But at the same time, deep
down, I liked it, and then--

20:38.149 --> 20:38.982
and then I woke up.

20:50.295 --> 20:53.664
Are you ready
to be in treatment?

20:53.666 --> 20:55.732
You're endangering her.

20:55.734 --> 20:57.100
What will it do?

20:57.102 --> 21:00.637
Transgenic in
vivo microbionic implants

21:00.639 --> 21:02.306
will cure you.

21:02.308 --> 21:05.842
This technology can
mutate your perception

21:05.844 --> 21:09.178
and free you from
your base program.

21:09.180 --> 21:12.649
It's a choice you can make.

21:12.651 --> 21:16.819
You can become something
better, something

21:16.821 --> 21:25.029
more refined, more evolved,
but you have to act now.

21:25.031 --> 21:29.599
This miracle process can only
work if you start your journey

21:29.601 --> 21:32.069
and allow it to take its course.

21:32.071 --> 21:33.703
Are you ready?

21:33.705 --> 21:34.271
Yes.

25:00.111 --> 25:00.879
Good morning.

25:04.149 --> 25:06.549
Congratulations on
starting your journey.

25:25.538 --> 25:26.106
Come closer.

25:30.275 --> 25:33.510
This is how your packages
will be delivered.

25:33.512 --> 25:36.346
Because this is a
personal process,

25:36.348 --> 25:40.584
you will install the
upgrades yourself.

25:40.586 --> 25:49.292
Package for patient 1379.

25:49.294 --> 25:51.028
Thank you.

25:51.030 --> 25:53.196
Just follow
the instructions.

25:53.198 --> 25:54.897
I'm here if you need help.

26:07.446 --> 26:11.447
Step one, remove this first
item from the package.

26:35.241 --> 26:39.643
Step two, use the item to
draw the specific lines.

27:10.341 --> 27:13.210
Step three, press the button.

27:31.429 --> 27:37.401
Step four, use the
item to penetrate.

27:37.403 --> 27:39.636
The pain will only be temporary.

28:20.512 --> 28:24.280
Step five, remove the
abcess from your body.

28:46.138 --> 28:51.377
Step six, take out the
beautiful and clean treatment.

28:56.682 --> 28:58.647
Apply the treatment in cavity.

29:10.029 --> 29:14.233
You are one step closer to
completion and being pure.

29:17.703 --> 29:20.302
Let go.

29:20.304 --> 29:21.073
Try to be free.

31:07.678 --> 31:11.248
You chose a path.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.151
Where were you?

31:14.686 --> 31:18.320
I you think you're great,
but I think we should continue

31:18.322 --> 31:21.857
our transition separately.

31:21.859 --> 31:26.799
I'm too far ahead of you, and I
see you like a man sees an ant.

31:30.869 --> 31:34.870
But I wish you well on your way.

31:34.872 --> 31:35.774
This is goodbye.

31:38.877 --> 31:40.476
Thanks for showing me my room.

32:16.581 --> 32:18.615
The
chrysalis is the pupal stage

32:18.617 --> 32:21.984
of the butterfly.

32:21.986 --> 32:26.889
Chrys s is Greek for gold.

32:26.891 --> 32:28.892
It's called that because
of the metallic gold

32:28.894 --> 32:31.864
color found in the pupae
of many butterflies.

32:34.966 --> 32:44.507
When the caterpillar
is fully grown,

32:44.509 --> 32:50.512
it fuses itself
with silk to a twig,

32:50.514 --> 32:52.784
then the caterpillar's
skin comes off.

32:59.858 --> 33:03.663
Under this old skin
is a hard covering.

33:06.998 --> 33:08.366
The chrysalis.

33:19.378 --> 33:20.609
Hi.

33:20.611 --> 33:20.912
Hey, mom.

33:25.984 --> 33:28.652
Sorry I haven't called.

33:28.654 --> 33:29.722
How are things going?

33:33.492 --> 33:35.024
Are you happy?

33:35.026 --> 33:35.694
Trying to be.

33:38.664 --> 33:41.030
Nothing's really
changed yet, but I'm

33:41.032 --> 33:42.267
committed to making it work.

33:45.637 --> 33:46.703
Well, that's good.

33:59.384 --> 34:01.287
What kind of stuff are
they having you do there?

34:06.925 --> 34:09.925
Mom, there's this girl here.

34:09.927 --> 34:11.661
You would like her.

34:11.663 --> 34:14.931
Be careful, sweetheart.

34:14.933 --> 34:16.831
Take it easy.

34:16.833 --> 34:17.335
I am.

34:20.371 --> 34:22.605
Don't get too close.

34:22.607 --> 34:24.708
You meet anyone else there?

34:24.710 --> 34:26.476
Anyone that works there?

34:26.478 --> 34:28.781
There's this voice who talks
to me through the intercom.

34:31.882 --> 34:39.855
I feel like this is my fault,
like I wasn't there enough.

34:39.857 --> 34:42.125
It's not your fault.

34:42.127 --> 34:47.130
Maybe if-- if I
was a better mother--

34:47.132 --> 34:48.732
No.

34:48.734 --> 34:49.733
That's not it, Mom.

37:29.226 --> 37:31.763
This has
already passed, just not yet.

37:36.835 --> 37:38.237
It's happening,
but somewhere else.

37:41.272 --> 37:44.075
How do I reconcile that
when things feel so real?

37:48.078 --> 37:48.746
So who are you?

37:52.317 --> 37:55.751
Are you my adversary?

37:55.753 --> 37:56.221
Are you my enemy?

38:00.157 --> 38:01.757
Are you a thing
that I must control?

38:12.703 --> 38:17.040
The way out is
really the way in.

38:17.042 --> 38:21.813
And the deeper in that I go,
the more free that I become.

38:26.284 --> 38:27.150
You are the person.

38:27.152 --> 38:29.152
You are the guide.

38:29.154 --> 38:31.186
You are the one that will
lead me back to myself.

41:39.277 --> 41:43.445
In this great delusion
of love, an object

41:43.447 --> 41:49.184
can not exist without
something else

41:49.186 --> 41:52.391
to reflect itself
back unto itself.

42:54.585 --> 42:56.184
How's the boy?

42:56.186 --> 42:57.089
Price-shachou.

43:03.862 --> 43:05.194
I didn't hear you come in.

43:12.502 --> 43:14.038
Is
everything on schedule?

43:18.942 --> 43:21.112
I think we are
about to find out.

43:26.183 --> 43:30.418
He's grown so
much since I last saw him.

43:30.420 --> 43:31.422
He's becoming a man.

43:35.493 --> 43:39.094
I don't have much
more time left.

43:39.096 --> 43:43.099
You will need to start
the transfer soon.

43:43.101 --> 43:45.101
Yes, Price-shachou.

45:17.761 --> 45:18.527
Sarah?

45:32.743 --> 45:35.344
Stay with me.

45:35.346 --> 45:36.648
It's not an option.

45:40.717 --> 45:41.619
I need you.

45:44.721 --> 45:48.456
Have to let me go.

45:48.458 --> 45:51.626
You can't follow
me where I'm going.

45:51.628 --> 45:53.161
That's not how it goes.

45:53.163 --> 45:59.168
Please, stay with me.

45:59.170 --> 46:02.137
I need you.

46:02.139 --> 46:05.141
Don't leave me, please.

46:05.143 --> 46:06.541
Don't leave.

46:17.522 --> 46:20.025
You are her, aren't you?

46:25.128 --> 46:26.529
I just need more time.

46:26.531 --> 46:28.400
We don't have any more time.

46:31.502 --> 46:32.003
Sorry.

46:37.107 --> 46:40.108
When you're at the
end of your journey,

46:40.110 --> 46:43.478
you'll come for me, in here.

47:57.188 --> 47:59.124
- I
- can feel myself changing.

48:02.826 --> 48:05.226
My mind is becoming less known.

48:08.833 --> 48:09.835
I need to release myself.

48:33.357 --> 48:33.657
Hey.

48:38.763 --> 48:42.234
I want to know every detail
about your entire life.

48:46.737 --> 48:47.703
Really?

48:47.705 --> 48:50.706
Yeah.

48:50.708 --> 48:53.308
Wait here for a second.

48:53.310 --> 48:55.311
Yeah.

48:55.313 --> 48:58.246
My mom gave me it
when she was younger.

48:58.248 --> 48:58.813
Don't stop.

49:04.654 --> 49:09.257
I came here
because I killed my--

49:21.639 --> 49:26.875
The bow of
God's wrath is bent,

49:26.877 --> 49:32.848
and the arrow made
ready on the string.

49:32.850 --> 49:38.554
And it is justice that bends
the arrow at your heart,

49:38.556 --> 49:39.958
and it strains the bow.

49:42.793 --> 49:52.835
And it is nothing but
the mere pleasure of God

49:52.837 --> 49:55.507
and that of an angry God.

50:00.511 --> 50:08.050
That without any promise
or obligation at all that

50:08.052 --> 50:16.291
keeps the arrow one moment from
being drunk with your blood.

50:16.293 --> 50:19.994
If your right eye
causes you to stumble,

50:19.996 --> 50:23.898
then tear it out and
throw it from you.

50:23.900 --> 50:30.338
For it is far better to lose
one of the parts of your body

50:30.340 --> 50:35.643
than to have your entire
body thrown into hell.

50:35.645 --> 50:41.616
The visions are triggered
by intense social connection.

50:41.618 --> 50:44.652
You yourself are still
quite susceptible,

50:44.654 --> 50:45.889
and are therefore in danger.

50:55.532 --> 51:00.601
Every time you open up, you
are putting everyone at risk.

51:00.603 --> 51:02.371
I can't believe you know that.

51:02.373 --> 51:03.938
That is the
purpose of the clinic.

51:12.549 --> 51:13.350
Tell me the truth.

51:16.052 --> 51:18.020
What's wrong with me?

51:18.022 --> 51:23.726
Your animal brain, bred
for harsh life on the savanna,

51:23.728 --> 51:26.094
is not suited to the
present-day world

51:26.096 --> 51:28.632
of civilization and discipline.

51:32.069 --> 51:36.771
You need to open up yourself
to complete reprogramming.

51:36.773 --> 51:38.773
Only then will you
have peace of mind.

51:38.775 --> 51:39.511
You don't get it.

51:43.913 --> 51:47.949
Even if I can
evolve, it'll never

51:47.951 --> 51:50.652
be enough to earn peace of mind.

51:50.654 --> 51:51.322
That's the thing.

51:54.525 --> 51:55.994
How could I ever
trust myself again?

51:58.728 --> 52:02.463
How could I ever get
close to anyone again?

52:02.465 --> 52:04.768
Well, for
instance, through a radio.

52:11.040 --> 52:11.743
Ozawa.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.045
That's your name.

52:17.047 --> 52:17.916
How do you know?

52:23.654 --> 52:26.154
Control yourself.

52:26.156 --> 52:28.991
Don't lose focus.

52:28.993 --> 52:31.462
Stay right here with me.

52:34.531 --> 52:36.800
Listen, you must exercise will.

52:41.438 --> 52:42.837
I've just felt
like this before.

52:42.839 --> 52:45.773
Stay right here with me.

52:53.817 --> 52:55.750
Yes.

52:55.752 --> 52:56.453
Let it all go.

52:59.690 --> 53:02.458
Let it all go out.

53:02.460 --> 53:04.460
It's OK.

53:04.462 --> 53:04.763
Yes.

55:11.721 --> 55:13.188
What happened?

55:13.190 --> 55:16.023
I need more.

55:16.025 --> 55:18.192
You've already
reached the limits of what

55:18.194 --> 55:20.027
we can safely do for you.

55:20.029 --> 55:21.762
I'm not clean.

55:21.764 --> 55:22.965
I'm not pure.

55:22.967 --> 55:24.632
I'm not perfect yet.

55:24.634 --> 55:26.268
What is this place?

55:26.270 --> 55:29.204
Does this stuff even work?

55:29.206 --> 55:32.010
Of course it works,
but it's not instant.

55:34.811 --> 55:37.244
And it's also up to you.

55:37.246 --> 55:40.081
You have to be able
to accept the changes,

55:40.083 --> 55:43.184
to let yourself be pure.

55:43.186 --> 55:45.353
What if I end my treatment?

55:45.355 --> 55:49.358
If you wish to
end your treatment now,

55:49.360 --> 55:51.029
I'll have to recommend
you be confined.

55:54.297 --> 55:55.797
Confined?

55:55.799 --> 55:57.335
Unfortunately
you are still a danger.

56:03.373 --> 56:06.875
Then I will
continue my treatment.

56:06.877 --> 56:07.645
Are you sure?

56:10.748 --> 56:12.114
Yes.

56:12.116 --> 56:12.813
Yes.

56:12.815 --> 56:14.949
I need it.

56:14.951 --> 56:17.219
There's one final level.

56:17.221 --> 56:20.021
We usually don't recommend
it to people transitioning

56:20.023 --> 56:21.422
for the first time.

56:21.424 --> 56:24.692
But in your case,
an exception might

56:24.694 --> 56:28.663
be made if you feel it
would help you progress.

56:28.665 --> 56:31.800
But I will need approval.

56:31.802 --> 56:32.670
Please.

56:37.373 --> 56:39.241
Please.

56:39.243 --> 56:40.074
Please.

56:40.076 --> 56:40.909
I fucking need it.

56:40.911 --> 56:42.978
Please.

56:42.980 --> 56:43.281
Please.

56:46.250 --> 56:47.416
Perhaps we should stop.

57:00.697 --> 57:01.398
I think we should try.

57:04.301 --> 57:07.469
A true purification might
simply be too much for him.

57:19.315 --> 57:20.851
We owe him our best efforts.

57:24.288 --> 57:28.223
I'll talk to him.

57:28.225 --> 57:29.190
Assess the risks.

57:55.485 --> 57:58.052
Time to get up.

57:58.054 --> 57:59.487
Don't worry.

57:59.489 --> 58:00.387
It'll all work out.

58:00.389 --> 58:02.224
You'll be OK.

58:02.226 --> 58:04.793
Who are you?

58:04.795 --> 58:06.194
My name's Dr. Hamilton Price.

58:16.072 --> 58:17.371
Do you know your
mother came here

58:17.373 --> 58:18.743
to this clinic as a young woman?

58:22.212 --> 58:22.714
Yes.

58:25.782 --> 58:40.094
Well, I
founded this clinic

58:40.096 --> 58:41.965
and I treated your mother.

58:48.505 --> 58:58.413
And let's just say I fell
in love with my work.

59:19.869 --> 59:20.772
You mean you're my--

59:30.214 --> 59:36.087
Yes, both figuratively
and literally.

59:40.556 --> 59:41.556
What's wrong with me?

59:51.101 --> 59:52.369
There's nothing
wrong with you.

59:55.205 --> 59:56.007
I have made mistakes.

59:58.641 --> 59:59.509
Lots of them.

01:00:05.047 --> 01:00:05.917
But you're not one.

01:00:08.951 --> 01:00:11.121
You've just been a slave to
other people's bad choices.

01:00:19.362 --> 01:00:26.236
Your mother and I, we've
accepted our responsibility.

01:00:29.906 --> 01:00:33.909
And now we're going to fix that.

01:00:33.911 --> 01:00:34.612
We're going to free you.

01:00:39.917 --> 01:00:42.683
Would you like that?

01:00:42.685 --> 01:00:43.451
Yes.

01:00:54.665 --> 01:00:55.663
Let me see your hands.

01:01:14.016 --> 01:01:20.457
I'm going to help
you, with this.

01:01:26.163 --> 01:01:27.063
Just lay back.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:51.152
We know a reflection
never really knows itself,

01:01:51.154 --> 01:01:54.926
never knows it's real,
because it isn't.

01:01:58.761 --> 01:01:59.994
Let's make you beautiful.

01:03:15.304 --> 01:03:16.170
Damn.

01:03:16.172 --> 01:03:18.273
This is good stuff.

01:03:18.275 --> 01:03:20.175
I feel it already.

01:03:35.558 --> 01:03:37.791
Think about it.

01:03:37.793 --> 01:03:39.062
I'll always be a danger.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:43.234
I don't know
when I'm doing it.

01:03:45.835 --> 01:03:46.803
I can't even trust myself.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:04:01.648
I've been thinking about
that, and I have an idea,

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:02.752
if you're willing to trust me.

01:04:09.426 --> 01:04:12.694
You shall be closer
to that source that

01:04:12.696 --> 01:04:15.395
brought us into being.

01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:21.271
You, as am I. I'm merely
the vessel of this creator.

01:04:29.746 --> 01:04:35.483
But I have created
this clinic to free us

01:04:35.485 --> 01:04:41.855
from the will of the maker,
for that we may freely

01:04:41.857 --> 01:04:45.763
give ourselves back
to the same life.

01:04:52.835 --> 01:04:54.737
You need to look
inside yourself.

01:04:57.806 --> 01:05:01.808
Myself.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:02.809
Let's sit.

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:25.235
Close your eyes.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:35.211
Now breathe.

01:05:40.683 --> 01:05:44.284
Breathe in.

01:05:44.286 --> 01:05:45.589
Now breathe out.

01:05:48.324 --> 01:05:57.732
Your breath is a ball of
energy, moving down your spine

01:05:57.734 --> 01:05:59.235
and the top of your head.

01:06:09.746 --> 01:06:13.250
Focus those thoughts
inward and see yourself.

01:06:16.987 --> 01:06:20.288
Puraisu-shacho, you'd
better take a look at this.

01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:21.623
I'm busy here.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:22.889
It's rejecting
the treatment, attacking

01:06:22.891 --> 01:06:23.860
like an invading army.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.800
This isn't right.

01:06:32.802 --> 01:06:33.835
We have to stop this.

01:06:50.819 --> 01:06:52.820
It's
working beautifully.

01:06:55.558 --> 01:06:56.824
Go on, Son.

01:06:56.826 --> 01:06:58.826
Accept it.

01:06:58.828 --> 01:06:59.730
Accept it.

01:07:05.435 --> 01:07:07.402
This is what
you call working?

01:07:07.404 --> 01:07:10.438
This is monstrous.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.838
We have to help him.

01:08:00.422 --> 01:08:02.725
What a
beautiful delusion I lived in.

01:08:10.699 --> 01:08:11.467
I had no idea.

01:08:17.741 --> 01:08:19.877
I summoned you thinking
that I would be safe.

01:08:24.781 --> 01:08:28.149
When I saw you, I ran.

01:08:28.151 --> 01:08:30.087
I ran to the edges
of my own reality.

01:08:33.522 --> 01:08:41.662
I ran to the place that I never
knew existed, the place where

01:08:41.663 --> 01:08:42.433
I would find myself.

01:08:45.435 --> 01:08:51.572
And I hid there for a
while, in plain sight.

01:08:51.573 --> 01:08:56.711
I must have looked like
a madman, overtaken

01:08:56.712 --> 01:08:59.116
with fear and grief.

01:09:03.719 --> 01:09:07.054
You had to go.

01:09:07.055 --> 01:09:11.492
You had to go far away
to forget what I saw

01:09:11.493 --> 01:09:16.130
and what I felt, and everything
and everyone associated

01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:29.042
to that, and create a new
reality because, you see,

01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:30.246
you destroyed my old one.

01:09:34.116 --> 01:09:35.785
So there was no going back.

01:09:39.856 --> 01:09:43.457
How have we changed ourselves?

01:09:43.459 --> 01:09:45.529
From one thing into another.

01:09:48.663 --> 01:09:54.668
I think the first step
is to allow our mind

01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:59.674
to ponder the possibility
that we may be nothing at all.

01:09:59.676 --> 01:10:03.510
That what we think
we are is actually

01:10:03.512 --> 01:10:10.150
a projection, a projection
of a fractured ego,

01:10:10.152 --> 01:10:11.855
a projection of a damaged mind.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.060
Failing to
gorge your senses

01:10:20.062 --> 01:10:22.762
from the social
contagion, picking meat

01:10:22.764 --> 01:10:25.899
from the incisors of hellhounds.

01:10:25.901 --> 01:10:30.604
So we're mixing herbs between
our toes as lightning strikes

01:10:30.606 --> 01:10:35.076
to reboot your antiquated
IBM desktop computer,

01:10:35.078 --> 01:10:39.046
and finally give you
something older to die for.

01:11:37.173 --> 01:11:39.340
But
there was very little that

01:11:39.342 --> 01:11:40.544
was original in my life.

01:11:45.815 --> 01:11:47.247
Everything was stolen
from the moment

01:11:47.249 --> 01:11:49.151
that I had seen
somewhere before.

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:59.827
It made me feel comfortable.

01:11:59.829 --> 01:12:05.800
It made me feel connected.

01:12:05.802 --> 01:12:11.171
It made me feel in
control of my destiny.

01:12:11.173 --> 01:12:13.808
His name-- his name-- his name--

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:26.854
you see, back then I thought
that that was what power was,

01:12:26.856 --> 01:12:28.292
to control the world around you.

01:12:33.396 --> 01:12:39.367
I feel like I'm meeting
myself everywhere I go.

01:12:39.369 --> 01:12:42.970
It can be daunting.

01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:43.970
It can be lonely.

01:13:12.869 --> 01:13:14.135
I am the vessel.

01:13:14.137 --> 01:13:20.277
Yet I'm always running
from that vessel.

01:13:25.213 --> 01:13:33.386
And in that and all
that big story, life--

01:13:33.388 --> 01:13:43.633
life seems to find me and
embrace me, but I fight it.

01:13:43.633 --> 01:13:49.970
life seems to find me and
embrace me, but I fight it.

01:13:49.972 --> 01:13:51.273
I never give in.

01:13:54.343 --> 01:13:56.743
And as I do, I sink
deeper into it.

01:14:36.451 --> 01:14:38.187
So there was no going back.

01:14:45.128 --> 01:14:53.000
The problem with the truth is
that once you know the truth

01:14:53.002 --> 01:14:56.170
you can't unknow it.

01:14:56.172 --> 01:14:59.540
It will haunt you.

01:14:59.542 --> 01:15:06.012
You will see it in everything,
and it will consume you.

01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:55.261
You see, I, like you, I came
into this world fighting,

01:15:55.263 --> 01:15:59.099
fighting to exist, fighting
to stay in existence.

01:16:25.594 --> 01:16:27.161
Oh my god.

01:16:39.075 --> 01:16:43.077
And for the first in life,

01:16:43.079 --> 01:16:49.049
in this experience that I call
life, did-- did-- did I --

01:16:49.051 --> 01:16:51.551
did I see myself being seen?

01:16:51.553 --> 01:16:52.653
Did I-- did I--

01:16:52.655 --> 01:16:54.421
being saved?

01:16:54.423 --> 01:16:58.658
And your eyes looked at me.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:03.930
For the first time I felt
the separation of myself--

01:17:03.932 --> 01:17:07.134
looking back at me--

01:17:07.136 --> 01:17:08.668
I was so scared.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:13.373
Close
your eyes and listen.

01:17:13.375 --> 01:17:15.341
And in that life--

01:17:15.343 --> 01:17:18.479
To hear the ocean.

01:17:18.481 --> 01:17:21.081
That
life that I've been hiding from.

01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:23.917
Became you.

01:17:23.919 --> 01:17:28.225
Be baptised,
son, and breathe in life.

01:17:31.326 --> 01:17:33.394
The water is a
symbol and you will

01:17:33.396 --> 01:17:38.000
be reborn as the ripples
travel across the surface.

01:17:41.437 --> 01:17:43.604
You will know the innocence
and bliss you deserve.

01:17:55.584 --> 01:17:59.623
You'll start feeling
less aware, less present.

01:18:03.325 --> 01:18:06.726
There will be no more growing.

01:18:06.728 --> 01:18:09.729
Not anymore.

01:18:09.731 --> 01:18:10.730
You're home.

01:18:41.664 --> 01:18:44.264
My baby.

01:18:44.266 --> 01:18:45.168
I'm here.

01:18:49.672 --> 01:18:50.671
I love you.

01:22:48.576 --> 01:22:53.247
I'm here to fix Kemet's last
sun soaked proto-computer.

01:22:53.249 --> 01:22:56.649
I heard it sputtering out
incomplete Communist Party word

01:22:56.651 --> 01:23:00.253
search results that'd
skipped from digital fuzz,

01:23:00.255 --> 01:23:04.591
coughing out ghost red briefs,
buffering mid-sentences,

01:23:04.593 --> 01:23:07.793
mind police come to feed.

01:23:07.795 --> 01:23:11.631
You buried the building blocks
of stylish dissent, minced

01:23:11.633 --> 01:23:14.967
in the watermelon
dance smoothie spill.

01:23:14.969 --> 01:23:19.973
Hand over your definition
for e-vites, to orgy bathing,

01:23:19.975 --> 01:23:23.676
and the chance to be
the single black friend

01:23:23.678 --> 01:23:27.980
to the sea of white merry-folk.

01:23:27.982 --> 01:23:32.885
Reselling dirty water with
top freshly digested favelas.

01:23:32.887 --> 01:23:36.823
Running past
improvised encampments.

01:23:36.825 --> 01:23:40.527
Radiating internet signals
from polished teeth,

01:23:40.529 --> 01:23:45.564
producing genetically altered
Pomeranians from phone apps.

01:23:45.566 --> 01:23:51.537
Making multi-million dollar
mistakes every god damn day.

01:23:51.539 --> 01:23:54.373
Voicing updates on
your pocket calculator

01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:56.842
from a bed of
constructive criticisms.

01:23:56.844 --> 01:23:59.979
Sandwiches of
repurposed ego meat,

01:23:59.981 --> 01:24:01.883
chewed into a
personality disorder.

01:24:05.553 --> 01:24:08.654
Lime here to wipe
the drive clean

01:24:08.656 --> 01:24:11.692
and reinstall the
guts of your computer,

01:24:11.694 --> 01:24:15.528
as you have become the safe
nigger, with a temperament

01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:19.599
that of an amicable butler,
be-speckled and disarmed.

01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:21.801
Behind ulterior
motives, your printer

01:24:21.803 --> 01:24:26.073
spits out sheets of acid,
completely tripping.

01:24:26.075 --> 01:24:30.042
Failing to guard your senses
from the social contagion,

01:24:30.044 --> 01:24:33.713
picking meat from the
incisors of hellhounds.

01:24:33.715 --> 01:24:38.385
So we're mixing herbs between
our toes as lightning strikes

01:24:38.387 --> 01:24:43.090
to reboot your antiquated
IBM desktop computer

01:24:43.092 --> 01:24:46.462
and finally give you
something older to die for.

01:24:53.401 --> 01:24:54.670
Free Black Press.

01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.976
I don't write
rhymes, I write code.

01:25:03.011 --> 01:25:08.547
We went to the Grammys to be
dubbed the King of Niggers.

01:25:08.549 --> 01:25:12.418
Spin dunking above
gourmet chicken.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.755
Screaming street
names and sports

01:25:14.757 --> 01:25:18.658
coverage of police shootings.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.760
We're all surprised
you took the time away

01:25:20.762 --> 01:25:26.565
from spearhead sharpening and
dice game refereeing to accept.

01:25:26.567 --> 01:25:31.470
Your hand slick with the blood
of fragile, young white women,

01:25:31.472 --> 01:25:34.975
pulverized under your concept.

01:25:34.977 --> 01:25:37.411
There are imaginary
emotional triggers

01:25:37.413 --> 01:25:42.549
howling at the moral barometer.

01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:44.784
Exploding screams
on the cell walls

01:25:44.786 --> 01:25:47.787
of a militarized touchy subject.

01:25:47.789 --> 01:25:52.993
You are dangerous and need to be
defanged before you can be cast

01:25:52.995 --> 01:25:55.595
in the multi-cultural milieu.

01:25:55.597 --> 01:26:00.833
So kneel or die broke.

01:26:00.835 --> 01:26:03.202
Your Grammy is placed
on a clean mantel

01:26:03.204 --> 01:26:06.806
as snipers flick
fingernails and tip jars,

01:26:06.808 --> 01:26:09.208
choke chains around
oversight panels.

01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:13.212
Bullets stacking up
in dressing rooms.

01:26:13.214 --> 01:26:15.215
Shine it.

01:26:15.217 --> 01:26:18.784
Make it the touch tone to
your cosmopolitan chugging.

01:26:18.786 --> 01:26:21.188
Lizard tongues
licking glowing teeth,

01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:25.158
as bubbledy blood
splashes behind them.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.060
Make it the badges
of your success.

01:26:28.062 --> 01:26:30.162
Make it the end
of your struggle.

01:26:30.164 --> 01:26:34.234
Unhook your jaw and
hand it to your sponsor.

01:26:34.236 --> 01:26:36.439
Toss your genitals to
the European doctors.

01:26:39.508 --> 01:26:39.876
And cry aloud.

01:27:21.452 --> 01:27:26.452
