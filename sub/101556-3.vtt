<i>These are the Mercury astronauts.</i>

00:22.928 --> 00:24.900
-I'm not gonna be one of the seven.
-No?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.610
I'm gonna be the first man in space.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.280
LOUDON:
<i>LIFE</i> will tell your stories, gentlemen.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.660
We will take the public on a journey
from the kitchen table to Pluto.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.912
It's 25,000 dollars a year.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.081
<i>This is a fresh start for us.</i>

00:39.831 --> 00:41.750
I'm Alan Shepard, astronaut.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.545
-You Dee?
-Second Lieutenant O'Hara.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.463
Only my friends call me "Dee."

00:46.922 --> 00:49.258
We're supposed to send a man
to space inside a year

00:49.383 --> 00:51.468
<i>and we are already a month</i>
<i>behind schedule.</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:56.640

Flight, charge off floor.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.136
MALE VOICE 2 OVER PA:<i> Flight,</i>
<i>I have a red light on capsule...</i>

01:34.219 --> 01:36.138
Flight, we see sustainer's not responding
to pitch and roll program.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.640
Are you seeing a board sequence
initiated on board, FIDO?

01:38.807 --> 01:41.768
-Flight, I show negative capsule set.
-Flight, TM frame loss from Goddard.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.312
What the hell is going on? Anyone?

01:43.395 --> 01:45.272
MALE VOICE OVER PA: <i>And can you confirm</i>
<i>the relay is green?</i>

01:45.355 --> 01:46.648
-Sending destruct command.
-Wait.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.275
Have you confirmed trajectory data?

01:48.358 --> 01:50.402
Is the rocket headed
for civilian population?

01:50.569 --> 01:52.571
Flight, MA-1 is still within range
to destruct...

01:52.696 --> 01:55.490
You are about to kill an astronaut, son.
Are you sure?

01:55.616 --> 01:58.452
Flight altitude decreasing.
Now at 14K.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.996
-(BEEPING)
-Separation is yellow.

02:04.333 --> 02:09.004
Standby. Loss of radar contact.
Break up of MA-1 nine miles downrange.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.298
RYERSON: Hope nobody has family
in Titusville.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.762
Mr. Hutmacher,
did you confirm trajectory data?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.515
Or did a little angel whisper in your ear?

02:20.599 --> 02:22.142
I confirmed good traj and flight...

02:22.267 --> 02:23.685
-But you hesitated.
-No.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.271
-Yes, I did.
-Do not hesitate in this room.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.440
I ask you a question,
you give me an answer.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.275
Yes, no, go, no go.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.695
-That's it. You're a machine.
-Don't second-guess me.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.077
-What the hell did you say?
-You're not acting like a machine.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.121
I was about to abort,
and you second-guessed my judgment.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.708
Ah, guys, this is a sim.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.710
It's just a game, right?

02:49.419 --> 02:50.837
(DRILLING)

02:57.177 --> 02:58.178
Lunney.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.932
Uh, the test was designed
to simulate multiple corrupted feeds

03:02.015 --> 03:04.059
with physical damage to the comm link.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.520
From what?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.235
-Large birds.
-(ALL CHUCKLE)

03:16.613 --> 03:17.698
Is that funny?

03:19.032 --> 03:22.703
We will keep running this simulation
until we get it right.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.833
We have a public launch
of a test rocket

03:28.417 --> 03:31.002
in four days. Press will be there.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.965
Representatives of your federal government
will be there.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.052
The wives and children
of our astronauts

03:39.511 --> 03:40.512
will be there.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.598
If we don't get these procedures
down cold,

03:43.682 --> 03:47.728
we really could blow up Titusville,
or Orlando, or Tampa.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.771
We will get this right.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.232
Is that clear?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.279
Is there any hesitation about that?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.202
Again.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.455

04:24.055 --> 04:25.056
You can cut it.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.851
ALAN:<i> Compared to what we do,</i>
<i>it's a carnival ride.</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:31.772
<i>The average fatality rate</i>
<i>of a Navy test pilot is 23 percent.</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:35.025
But any pilot you're talking to
is still alive.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.277
Which means he isn't average.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.073
I mean, that's about the shape of it.
You make it sound heroic.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.452
Well, we can always rewrite it
if it don't. Right?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.788
DEE: They're ready for you, Al.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.382
What's the best time?

04:59.883 --> 05:02.469
It's always about beating something
with you guys, isn't it?

05:02.803 --> 05:04.346
Well, everybody likes a winner, Dee.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.932
-What if you don't win?
-Hasn't happened yet.

<i>Have medical check him.</i>

That baby ain't so bad. It's like floating
in a tube down the Lazy Hole River.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.254
Hell, I could've put my feet up,
taken a nap.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.589
Yeah, try that next time.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.883
God, I picked the wrong time
to quit smoking.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.634
You didn't quit smoking.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.927
Sure I did.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.347
So, is this MASTIF how they pick
who's gonna be first?

06:29.431 --> 06:30.557
No way.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.601
-Thing is a toy.
-SCOTT: So, what then?

06:32.976 --> 06:35.270
We've been at it for months,
and they still haven't told us.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.106
It's probably, you know,
who's the best overall.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.611
-And who's that? You?
-Right about now, it might be. Yeah.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.489
Would you please
shut your damn mouth, Gordo?

I mean, none of us would be
in this program if we weren't, but...

07:42.003 --> 07:45.131
I do think that we're all aware
in our own individual ways

07:45.382 --> 07:47.342
that this thing is bigger
than any one of us,

07:47.509 --> 07:50.178
and that tends to bring out
the best in men.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.056
You know, service to a cause
greater than yourself,

07:53.181 --> 07:56.351
and I can't think of a better cause
than this one right now.

07:57.602 --> 08:02.148
