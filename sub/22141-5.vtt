Let us take you now...

00:26.127 --> 00:29.330
To the island of short memories

00:29.363 --> 00:31.965
and the small village
of fat hopes.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.870
It hardly featured on any map.

00:36.904 --> 00:40.941
But, thanks to the civil war
of lies,

00:40.974 --> 00:42.876
the small village
of fat hopes had grown

00:42.910 --> 00:44.445
in importance

00:44.478 --> 00:46.947
for all the wrong reasons.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.385
They spoke in color
in the village

00:51.419 --> 00:54.222
as they did in most parts
of the country.

00:54.255 --> 00:59.460
The cost of living
made people purple.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.963
People often felt marooned,

01:02.996 --> 01:08.536
and the jokes were always black.

The war is over.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.049
At the old hotel,

02:29.082 --> 02:31.285
the 50 caliber
in the tower next door

02:31.319 --> 02:35.689
is wrapped up and attended
by one sleepy guard.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.360
The main enemy today
is not the soldiers,

02:39.393 --> 02:44.965
guerillas, fighters, and
suicide bombers of the LTTE

02:44.998 --> 02:46.700
but the black crows

02:46.734 --> 02:48.869
who hover ominously
over the breakfast buffet

02:48.902 --> 02:50.003
on the veranda.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.910
A man with a slingshot
patrols the lawn,

02:56.944 --> 02:59.380
driving them away
with an occasional shot.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.932
Colombo, capital city
of Sri Lanka.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.769
Unlike the last time I came here

03:21.802 --> 03:23.737
nearly a decade ago,

03:23.771 --> 03:26.674
this South Asian island nation
of 20 million

03:26.707 --> 03:31.111
does not feel on lockdown.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.447
There are no longer
the military checkpoints

03:33.481 --> 03:35.616
and heavy equipment,
sandbags or barbed wire

03:35.649 --> 03:40.187
in between the airport
and the center of town.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.424
There's a new democratically
elected government

03:43.457 --> 03:48.262
voted in by a coalition
of former adversaries.

03:48.296 --> 03:51.965
Everywhere you look,
construction, expansion,

03:51.999 --> 03:53.467
new hotels, foreign money,

03:53.501 --> 03:56.837
something that looks
a lot like hope.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.941
Hundreds of thousands
of dead and missing later,

04:00.974 --> 04:02.643
the country is at peace,

04:02.676 --> 04:05.379
and we can go where we want.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.816
Hopefully, people will be able
to talk about their lives.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.319
Last time, they couldn't.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.390
So this is the Galle Face Green.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.392
It used to be a place
for the English families

04:18.426 --> 04:20.827
to come and hang out on Sundays.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.896
And it was also the home

04:22.930 --> 04:24.832
of the first golf course
in Sri Lanka.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.634
This is our Central Park.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.668
Ah.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.030
What are we eating today
by the way? What's good here?

04:57.064 --> 04:59.166
So this is all
Sri Lankan street food.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.469
These kitchens are run
by Muslims.

05:01.502 --> 05:05.038
So, there's no pork dishes.
A lot of seafood.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.376
Dharshan runs several
popular Colombo restaurants,

05:08.409 --> 05:10.644
including The Ministry of Crab.

05:10.678 --> 05:14.548
When not catering
to the needs of his customers,

05:14.582 --> 05:16.717
he enjoys simpler fare.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.250
♪

05:27.661 --> 05:29.563
So what distinguishes

05:29.597 --> 05:31.965
Sri Lankan cuisine and Indian?

05:31.999 --> 05:35.202
I think our curries are lighter,

05:35.235 --> 05:39.239
and I think it's the access
to seafood.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.975
If you look at Mumbai,
it's 20 million people.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.077
The ocean's under pressure.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.847
Here it's so clean
we can have access

05:46.880 --> 05:48.248
to great seafood any time.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.883
When did the war get bad?

05:49.917 --> 05:52.152
It got really bad
I think 2005 onwards,

05:52.185 --> 05:53.253
it was really bad.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.656
Yeah, we were last here

05:55.689 --> 05:57.057
in 2008.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.692
I mean, just to get
to the hotel,

05:58.726 --> 06:00.894
I remember, from the airport

06:00.928 --> 06:02.329
we had to go through

06:02.362 --> 06:04.832
one security cordon
after another.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.567
During those times,
we had no idea

06:06.600 --> 06:07.835
when it was going to end.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.370
I've done business
in this country

06:10.404 --> 06:13.040
never knowing what
a peaceful time would be.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.389
How long have things been quiet?

06:29.423 --> 06:32.626
Well, the war ended in 2009.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.061
It's been eight years.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.630
It takes time for things
to happen.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.798
Things have happened though.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.299
The city's not overgrown.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.901
We aren't overpopulated.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.603
The oceans are still clean.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.472
Whatever the underlying
problems were,

06:44.505 --> 06:47.207
do you think they are
being addressed

06:47.240 --> 06:48.476
or will be addressed?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.911
I think they are
being addressed.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.379
Maybe a bit slow.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.314
But I think you will
find a difference.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.883
So the world has changed,

06:55.916 --> 06:57.885
and it's great to see
stuff like this.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.788
♪

07:05.192 --> 07:07.461
Evening fell

07:07.495 --> 07:10.263
upon the small village
of fat hopes.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.965
Suddenly, they heard a noise

07:11.999 --> 07:14.502
that filled them with dread.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.523
Ah! Ah!

07:48.702 --> 07:52.573
There was honestly
such a culture of fear.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.846
An incredible amount
of self-censorship.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.715
We had death squads,

08:01.749 --> 08:05.553
people, journalists,
so many being disappeared.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.858
This kind of white van
phenomenon

08:10.891 --> 08:13.160
where, you know, your loved
ones were taken from you

08:13.193 --> 08:15.228
and you never heard
from them again.

08:15.262 --> 08:18.498
They're still so many
of those cases going on,

08:18.532 --> 08:23.070
and just a real feeling of fear.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.874
From 1983 until 2009,

08:26.907 --> 08:28.341
Sri Lanka's bloody civil war

08:28.375 --> 08:30.544
divided the island in two,

08:30.578 --> 08:32.645
splitting the country
along religious lines...

08:32.679 --> 08:34.914
Buddhist Sinhalese majority
in the South

08:34.948 --> 08:37.918
versus Hindu Tamil minority
in the North.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.587
Years of mistreatment
and suppression

08:40.621 --> 08:43.356
led to the formation
of the LTTE,

08:43.390 --> 08:45.726
or Liberation Tamil Tigers
of Eelam

08:45.759 --> 08:49.196
and their campaign to seek
an independent state.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.905
The conflict ended in 2009,

08:57.938 --> 09:00.608
but an enormous number of
internally displaced persons,

09:00.641 --> 09:02.776
or IDPs as they were
referred to,

09:02.810 --> 09:04.578
remain in refugee camps.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.114
Ladies and gentlemen,
appearing now

09:07.147 --> 09:09.282
and before it is too late,

09:09.316 --> 09:13.621
the traveling circus
of refugees.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.465
Colombo native Tracy
Holsinger is the founder

09:25.498 --> 09:27.868
of Mind Adventures
Theatre Company.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.970
Not long ago,
to even talk politics

09:30.003 --> 09:32.906
let alone stage a play
deemed controversial,

09:32.940 --> 09:34.608
could be dangerous.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.144
The play that you've been doing

09:37.177 --> 09:40.280
came from a book or...

09:40.313 --> 09:42.750
"Speaks in Numbers"
by Mike Masilamani.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.654
It was first performed
in November 2009.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.956
- Controversial would you say?
- A little.

09:48.989 --> 09:53.060
The play is about
internally displaced people.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.795
After the end of the war,

09:54.828 --> 09:59.466
we had over 300,000 people
in camps.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.334
The largest one of them

10:01.368 --> 10:03.737
was built to house
100,000 people

10:03.771 --> 10:07.641
but ended up housing
227,000 people.

10:07.675 --> 10:11.178
Tents that were designed for
maybe five people to be in

10:11.211 --> 10:14.147
had 10 to 15 people in them.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.149
There were no toilets
in the camp.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.318
There were just these big pits.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.987
Living conditions
for these people

10:20.020 --> 10:21.922
was intolerable.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.325
There are some communities,
Anthony, in this country

10:25.358 --> 10:27.594
that have been displaced
for 25 years.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.863
That means since the '80s

10:29.897 --> 10:31.364
they haven't had a home.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.267
Hurry up!
Don't waste my time.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.269
What's in the bag?
It's just some-

10:36.303 --> 10:38.371
- Can't take anything
inside the camp.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.808
Search this.
Hurry up, next!

10:40.841 --> 10:43.043
It's a play that was staged
at a time

10:43.076 --> 10:45.378
when all this was so raw for us.

10:45.412 --> 10:49.549
And there is no way
to speak directly

10:49.582 --> 10:51.284
about what happened.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.721
I think it's still
very difficult

10:53.754 --> 10:56.223
not just for us
but for people to acknowledge

10:56.256 --> 10:58.391
that these terrible things
were done

10:58.425 --> 11:02.062
to part of our community
and our people.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.231
Was this a perilous thing to do?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.266
And how was it seen at the time?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.137
You know, I didn't think

11:10.170 --> 11:12.239
about whether it was
perilous or not,

11:12.272 --> 11:14.641
and that's probably bad on me

11:14.674 --> 11:17.344
because I involved
all these other people.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.079
That scene is done.
We're moving on.

11:19.112 --> 11:23.216
For me, the important thing
was making sure

11:23.250 --> 11:26.019
that in whatever form
it got out there

11:26.053 --> 11:29.422
the play's out there
and it reminds people

11:29.456 --> 11:31.524
that this happened.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.693
We found the person responsible

11:33.727 --> 11:37.931
for trying to poison the minds
of all you good people

11:37.965 --> 11:39.399
with these lies!

11:39.432 --> 11:42.402
She was sleeping amongst you.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.105
Living amongst you.

11:45.138 --> 11:48.441
And there are many others
like her.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.745
Let this be a lesson to you all.

11:51.779 --> 11:55.348
This is how we deal
with traitors.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.017
Take her away!

11:57.050 --> 11:59.953
No, please, please.

11:59.987 --> 12:00.954
- No!
- Please!

12:06.159 --> 12:10.063
So, are things getting better?

12:10.097 --> 12:11.298
I would say in one sense

12:11.331 --> 12:13.767
we're not so afraid.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.903
You're not afraid to speak out.

12:15.936 --> 12:19.639
But also I wouldn't say
everything is wonderful.

12:19.672 --> 12:23.110
It's not... I think things
are slowly being pushed,

12:23.143 --> 12:25.412
but it's too slow.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.314
So, 20 years from now,

12:27.347 --> 12:29.316
are you optimistic, pessimistic?

12:29.349 --> 12:30.851
What do you think?

13:01.048 --> 13:03.616
Sri Lanka,
formerly known as Ceylon,

13:03.650 --> 13:06.586
was once the crown jewel
of the spice trade.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.690
Its cloves, cardamom,
pepper, nutmeg,

13:10.723 --> 13:14.794
mace, ginger, cinnamon,
chilies, and curry...

13:16.129 --> 13:18.265
...the envy of the world.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.134
These spices built empires.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.506
Wow.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.141
- Chicken curry.
- Marvelous.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.543
Then you have potatoes
that are spicy.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.179
- Right.
- Then you have the beets.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.882
This is one of the traditional
samples of Sri Lanka.

13:34.915 --> 13:35.849
Right.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.051
Kumar Lopez is a Tamil

13:38.085 --> 13:40.053
who works for the Sri Lankan
Press Institute.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.790
We sit down for lunch at
a local rice and curry joint.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.460
So, last time I was here
was nine years ago.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.229
Things have changed a lot.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.830
I think, yes.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.665
I think the fact that
we're able to eat today

13:52.699 --> 13:55.402
without even thinking
that there could be a bomb

13:55.435 --> 13:57.170
that could go off at any moment

13:57.204 --> 14:00.173
is the best peace
that you could expect.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.475
But I believe that peace
can go to another stage,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.077
another level.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.346
In the mindset of those
who have been impacted

14:06.379 --> 14:07.847
by the war,

14:07.881 --> 14:09.516
I think there needs to be

14:09.549 --> 14:11.952
further work to be done.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.422
After World War II,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.057
the British left Sri Lanka.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.692
Over time, the Buddhist
Sinhalese majority

14:19.726 --> 14:21.428
both excluded and repressed

14:21.461 --> 14:23.430
the mostly Hindu Tamil minority

14:23.463 --> 14:25.598
channeling populist fervor

14:25.632 --> 14:28.568
to turn discrimination into law.

14:28.601 --> 14:32.005
What is the generally accepted
underlying reasons

14:32.039 --> 14:33.941
for the conflict
in the first place?

14:33.974 --> 14:36.276
The main cause
or the main objective

14:36.309 --> 14:39.512
was to have a separate land
for the Tamils.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.081
The underlying reason
for that being

14:41.114 --> 14:44.284
there was discrimination,
there was racism,

14:44.317 --> 14:47.220
and that basically brought them
to this stage.

14:47.254 --> 14:51.124
By 1983, the situation
reached its boiling point.

14:51.158 --> 14:55.362
The LTTE began waging
what would become

14:55.395 --> 14:57.230
a 25-year guerilla war

14:57.264 --> 14:59.599
before government forces
crushed them

14:59.632 --> 15:01.935
in a brutal final offensive.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.304
I mean, the war was won
militarily.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.573
Is everybody speaking now?

15:06.606 --> 15:09.977
I think the underlying objective

15:10.010 --> 15:13.080
is definitely to bring about
lasting peace.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.984
They actually encouraged
some of the [indistinct]

15:17.017 --> 15:19.987
To invest in the market
to give job opportunities.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.722
So, peace is something
that everybody is looking for.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.628
So, I'll be taking
the train to Jaffna shortly.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.397
This is a big deal.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.665
Oh, it wasn't running
probably for the last 30 years.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.402
Whoa, whoa, it hasn't
been running for 30 years?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.504
Right, not been running
a minimum of 20 years.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.299
- Because of the conflict?
- Because of the conflict.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.273
Wow.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.372
With the war over,

16:12.405 --> 16:15.542
Sri Lankans can now travel
freely across their country

16:15.575 --> 16:18.945
all the way north to Jaffna.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.281
Last time, we couldn't go there.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.217
Today, we will.

16:29.256 --> 16:32.359
Early morning, Colombo Station.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.167
The platform's bustle
is a mix of commuters,

16:40.200 --> 16:43.936
long distance travelers,
and the occasional tourist.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.886
Breaking free from Colombo's
gravitational pull,

17:33.920 --> 17:36.389
the landscape opens up.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.261
The second and third class
compartments

17:41.294 --> 17:45.165
host a mix of people, smells,
and slices of life.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.376
Commuters get on at one station,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.411
off at another.

17:58.445 --> 18:02.048
Others like me
are in for the long haul,

18:02.081 --> 18:04.251
ten hours to Jaffna.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.333
That the Jaffna Queen
runs at all

18:20.367 --> 18:24.237
is a symbolic move
towards reunification.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.006
As the fight for an
independent Tamil state

18:27.039 --> 18:29.309
in Sri Lanka's north
intensified,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.778
the LTTE destroyed these tracks.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.646
For the last two decades
of the war,

18:33.680 --> 18:37.317
Jaffna was all but cut off
from the rest of the world.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.628
♪

18:51.398 --> 18:54.501
The LTTE, unable to match
the military might

18:54.534 --> 18:55.868
of the Sri Lankan Army,

18:55.902 --> 18:58.137
fought their war by other means,

18:58.171 --> 19:00.707
every means
they deemed necessary.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.844
Acts of terrorism,
suicide bombings,

19:04.877 --> 19:06.313
political assassinations

19:06.346 --> 19:07.980
brought government retaliation.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.218
And collective punishment

19:11.251 --> 19:13.186
of an equally terrible kind

19:13.220 --> 19:15.188
and enormous in scale.

19:15.222 --> 19:19.058
The North suffered
massive bombardments

19:19.091 --> 19:20.560
of civilian areas.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.028
Hundreds of thousands of Tamils

19:22.061 --> 19:25.064
ended up in refugee camps.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.733
By the time it was over,

19:26.766 --> 19:29.168
war crimes had been committed
on both sides,

19:29.202 --> 19:33.406
those caught in the middle
paying the ultimate toll.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.576
In the final weeks alone,

19:36.609 --> 19:38.545
at least 40,000 people
were killed

19:38.578 --> 19:42.114
in a war the outside world
knew little of.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.233
Nearing the end of the line,

20:00.267 --> 20:02.502
weary passengers awake
to find themselves

20:02.535 --> 20:04.271
in a different world.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.273
Out the window, the air is thick

20:06.306 --> 20:09.476
with the smell of salt and sea.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.176
Jaffna is about as far north
as you can go

21:17.209 --> 21:19.846
without hitting India.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.148
This is the homeland

21:22.181 --> 21:24.584
of Sri Lanka's
Tamil ethnic minority

21:24.617 --> 21:25.852
and during the civil war

21:25.885 --> 21:30.056
base of the LTTE Tamil Tigers.

21:33.192 --> 21:37.397
Remnants of the conflict
are hard to miss.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.058
But on any given day
down by the coast,

22:06.092 --> 22:07.560
the fish market buzzes,

22:07.594 --> 22:09.896
a hive of activity and commerce.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.401
Fresh product comes in,

22:14.434 --> 22:16.869
deals are made,
money changes hands,

22:16.903 --> 22:18.905
life goes on.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.510
Initially before the war,

22:23.543 --> 22:27.079
the North and East
contributed 40% of the GDP.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.015
- And now?
- Three percent.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.750
There were so many
industries here.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.385
Everything was destroyed.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.554
There was no electricity
for a long time.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.424
I had a coconut farm,
about 100 acres,

22:37.457 --> 22:40.660
and it was completely destroyed
during the war.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.696
There's not even a single tree
with a bullet hole.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.599
Like many Sri Lankan Tamils,

22:46.633 --> 22:48.100
Janna was born here

22:48.134 --> 22:49.902
but with considerable regret

22:49.936 --> 22:52.371
spent much of his life abroad.

22:52.405 --> 22:55.074
The fighting has stopped.
Absolutely, that's true.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.509
What's changed?

22:56.543 --> 22:58.445
A lot of things
have been rebuilt.

22:58.478 --> 23:03.249
Slowly now they are focusing
on rebuilding infrastructures.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.452
They are renovating
all these ponds

23:05.485 --> 23:07.420
and lagoons,

23:07.454 --> 23:09.889
and now slowly business
is thriving

23:09.922 --> 23:13.626
in this part of the country.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.127
The underlying discontent,

23:15.161 --> 23:17.196
the given reasons for the war,

23:17.229 --> 23:20.032
is there a sense that
those problems

23:20.066 --> 23:21.367
are being addressed?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.970
The war was very brutal,

23:24.003 --> 23:28.441
and people after 30 years
everybody's tired of it.

23:28.475 --> 23:33.145
We have a very affected
population.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.548
There are about
30,000 war widows

23:35.582 --> 23:38.818
and close to 25,000
orphaned children,

23:38.851 --> 23:43.590
about 15,000 people
who were landmine victims.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.425
From the government side,
they are still a bit scared

23:46.459 --> 23:49.562
that there may be
war popping up again.

23:49.596 --> 23:53.600
But slowly now they are
addressing issues

23:53.633 --> 23:56.503
like employment-wise,
opportunities-wise,

23:56.536 --> 23:58.337
and there are a lot
of occupied lands.

23:58.370 --> 24:01.007
Now they are slowly
giving it back.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.341
So, hopeful?

24:02.374 --> 24:04.511
Yeah, I see the progress.

24:04.544 --> 24:07.647
What I see here
is the human resilience,

24:07.680 --> 24:10.950
like after going through
this war for 30 years,

24:10.983 --> 24:13.853
how quickly people here
can rebuild.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.897
So, what's happening today?

24:31.904 --> 24:33.706
First of all, where are we?

24:33.740 --> 24:36.543
This is a Kali temple.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.010
And Kali is?

24:38.044 --> 24:39.979
Kali is the destroyer of evil.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.380
People go and pray

24:41.413 --> 24:43.616
and have Kali temples
in villages

24:43.650 --> 24:46.786
because it destroys evil power.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.887
Both good and bad?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.722
- Yes.
- Protector?

24:49.756 --> 24:52.391
- Protector, destroyer, yes.
- Destroyer.

24:52.424 --> 24:55.662
Because Kali's also known
for courage and valor.

24:55.695 --> 24:58.230
Like when people go to war
and things like that,

24:58.264 --> 25:00.567
they go and pray to Kali

25:00.600 --> 25:03.235
to give them the confidence
and the courage

25:03.269 --> 25:04.904
to go and fight.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.585
After decades of
cultural suppression,

25:18.618 --> 25:20.887
Tamils take great pride
in their customs,

25:20.920 --> 25:23.823
traditions
and religious festivals.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.432
Around here, the Madai Festival

25:33.465 --> 25:35.367
is the most auspicious day
of the year

25:35.401 --> 25:37.670
for Hindus to balance
their spiritual debts.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.773
Believers show devotion
through suffering,

25:40.807 --> 25:43.409
enduring acts
of great pain and hardship

25:43.442 --> 25:47.313
called kavadis
or the burden debts.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.455
Kavadis can take many forms.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.457
You can make a pilgrimage
to the main temple

25:58.490 --> 26:00.893
on shoes made of nails.

26:02.595 --> 26:04.797
Or roll there on the ground

26:04.831 --> 26:07.934
often for a distance
of several kilometers.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.435
These are some of the ways

26:09.468 --> 26:12.104
believers express gratitude
to Kali

26:12.138 --> 26:13.906
or implore her for help.

26:15.808 --> 26:19.746
Ritualistic body piercing
is another such expression.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.773
It's a very interesting thing.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.776
They prepare for a long time...
28 days, they fast.

26:49.809 --> 26:53.312
And they condition themselves
mentally.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.847
And when they come
to the temple,

26:54.881 --> 26:57.684
and there's a special ceremony
which takes place.

26:57.717 --> 27:01.153
And they kind of chant
and play drums and everything,

27:01.187 --> 27:03.155
so you get into a trance.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.970
The greater the pain,
the greater your dedication

27:18.004 --> 27:19.772
to your higher power.

27:19.806 --> 27:24.711
Well, let's just say
viewer discretion is advised.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.908
The islands off Jaffna's coast

29:35.942 --> 29:37.743
were holdouts during
the Tamil resistance

29:37.776 --> 29:39.678
and saw heavy fighting.

29:39.711 --> 29:43.082
The people who remained,
like the landscape itself,

29:43.115 --> 29:44.616
bear heavy scars.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.352
This was a conflict that left

29:46.385 --> 29:49.521
more than 80,000 women widowed.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.958
The whole island is very quiet.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.193
You do not see shops
filled with people

29:54.226 --> 29:57.163
or children playing in yards

29:57.196 --> 29:58.364
or people in fields.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.532
It felt very, very, very quiet.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.469
Is that a good quiet
or a bad quiet?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.938
It's an area that has been
severely depopulated

30:05.972 --> 30:08.174
as you would have noticed
when you came here.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.210
Now, when you say depopulated,

30:11.243 --> 30:13.279
people fled, people were killed,

30:13.312 --> 30:14.680
people were disappeared.

30:28.260 --> 30:31.663
Within three hours in 1991,

30:31.697 --> 30:35.968
the entire area was evacuated
of its population.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.337
People have only started
coming back

30:38.370 --> 30:40.907
to live here
relatively recently.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.010
A very small percentage
of the original population

30:44.043 --> 30:45.577
that has come back.

30:45.611 --> 30:50.182
In Tamil society
as in much of the world,

30:50.216 --> 30:53.052
women have few rights,

30:53.085 --> 30:57.756
no official system
to look after or support them.

30:57.789 --> 31:00.359
The North Ceylon
Community Project

31:00.392 --> 31:01.994
seeks to address that problem

31:02.028 --> 31:03.829
providing a home and training
for women

31:03.862 --> 31:05.731
who might otherwise
be living on the street.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.733
Guari is from this area

31:07.766 --> 31:10.202
and one of the organization's
benefactors.

31:10.236 --> 31:13.372
Culturally, a woman
who's a widow

31:13.405 --> 31:15.341
who has lost her husband

31:15.374 --> 31:18.244
is a total social outcast

31:18.277 --> 31:19.578
and becomes terribly vulnerable

31:19.611 --> 31:21.680
to all other types of abuse

31:21.713 --> 31:22.975
because they have no source
of income.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.383
They have no one
to protect them,

31:24.416 --> 31:26.018
no one to look after them.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.787
So this organization has grown

31:28.820 --> 31:31.590
to be a safe haven.

31:40.632 --> 31:45.037
Now, you provide
food, shelter, job training,

31:45.071 --> 31:48.307
some road
to financial independence?

31:48.340 --> 31:51.143
When they come here,
they are given a place to stay.

31:51.177 --> 31:54.947
There also is a group of them
who come here for daily work.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.882
And there are different projects

31:56.915 --> 31:59.986
that are skills training
projects for the women.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.222
Within this space, they're
given the strength, the skills,

32:03.255 --> 32:07.226
and the opportunities
to change their lives.

32:35.988 --> 32:39.358
So, why stay? I mean,
it's an obvious question.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.626
So many have left.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.128
Why stay here?

32:42.161 --> 32:44.863
Where you come from
is very important.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.532
So I think in this culture

32:46.565 --> 32:49.635
it is about where your
roots are,

32:49.668 --> 32:51.637
where your family history is.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.772
What about these kids?

32:53.805 --> 32:57.209
When they're 16, 17, 18.

32:57.243 --> 32:59.011
They are going to finish
their education,

32:59.045 --> 33:01.180
and then they're going
to be looking for jobs.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.550
And those jobs are not
materializing in these areas.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.219
So, in the past
a number of young people

33:07.253 --> 33:10.722
would find ways and means,

33:10.756 --> 33:12.124
often very risky ways and means,

33:12.158 --> 33:13.959
to leave Sri Lanka
and go abroad.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.795
So, unless there is
some really serious efforts

33:16.828 --> 33:20.832
to revive economic activities
and investment,

33:20.866 --> 33:23.169
life is going to be
very tough for these kids.

33:40.419 --> 33:43.255
Ask anyone in Sri Lanka
where to find the best food,

33:43.289 --> 33:46.525
and they'll say "Nobody cooks
as well as Auntie."

33:46.558 --> 33:48.394
And it's true... trust me.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.729
Often possessing
the strength of ten men,

33:50.762 --> 33:54.366
Sri Lankan aunties are a force
to be reckoned with.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.469
Jaffna crab curry

34:30.502 --> 34:32.070
might be, for me anyway,

34:32.103 --> 34:34.572
the holy grail
of Sri Lankan cuisine.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.708
Spicy and fiery,

34:37.743 --> 34:41.012
in a cuisine known for being
spicy and fiery already.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.483
During the war years,

34:44.516 --> 34:47.585
it was hard to get crabs
like this and still is today,

34:47.619 --> 34:49.255
the majority being exported

34:49.288 --> 34:51.123
to other parts of the country
and abroad.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.391
But, in this time capsule
of a home,

34:53.425 --> 34:56.462
it might as well still be 1953.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.397
I've been invited here
by Dr. Ravi,

34:58.430 --> 35:00.899
his sister, Giva,
and their beloved auntie,

35:00.932 --> 35:02.734
best cook in the family.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.336
So there we have it.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.938
Welcome to Jaffna.
Welcome to paradise.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.807
Thank you. Thank you.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.476
These are delicious, by the way.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.245
- They're great, aren't they?
- Wow. Are they toasted?

35:13.279 --> 35:16.081
They're dipped in yogurt,
dried, sun-dried.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.950
Wow. This is
a beautiful home.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.286
Thank you very much.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.020
Built in the '30s?

35:22.053 --> 35:25.123
In the '30s
or late British period.

35:25.157 --> 35:28.694
How is it that this
remained in the family

35:28.727 --> 35:29.995
that you were able to hang on

35:30.028 --> 35:31.530
and you're still here?

35:31.563 --> 35:34.533
During the war,
the Tigers lived here,

35:34.566 --> 35:37.636
and then the Sri Lankan Army
lived here for a little while.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.272
My father kept coming back here

35:40.306 --> 35:44.210
making sure he made
his presence known.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.278
I think the thing is
that it was...

35:46.312 --> 35:51.517
It has a lot of,
you know, family stories.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.385
So, even a lot of my cousins

35:53.419 --> 35:56.888
have a great attachment
to this house.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.228
Can I get you some more
crab curry?

36:02.261 --> 36:04.029
Please, thank you.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.666
Thank you, so beautiful.
Thank you.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.067
So delicious.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.737
I've been to a lot of places

36:11.770 --> 36:14.906
just after really awful,
awful conflicts.

36:14.940 --> 36:19.211
Some nations, there's
a simmering and boiling sense

36:19.245 --> 36:22.080
of injustice, rage, humiliation,

36:22.113 --> 36:24.850
particularly when you have
large groups of young people

36:24.883 --> 36:26.918
unemployed, wandering around.

36:26.952 --> 36:30.389
Do you think there's
any possibility

36:30.422 --> 36:33.091
that if everybody doesn't
get the recipe right

36:33.124 --> 36:36.662
that we could see
another generation

36:36.695 --> 36:39.164
of adversaries?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.099
Generally speaking,
people want to get along

36:41.132 --> 36:43.535
because my generation,

36:43.569 --> 36:45.604
they certainly don't want
to go back to...

36:45.637 --> 36:46.772
- To that.
- To that.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.107
♪

36:49.140 --> 36:51.877
I think the generation
that might

36:51.910 --> 36:55.347
are the five, six year olds
at school now

36:55.381 --> 36:58.517
who have forgotten the horrors.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.220
You go back to AK-47,
my six months in the sun.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.855
I think I am optimistic,

37:03.889 --> 37:05.049
but I think that
one of the first things

37:05.056 --> 37:06.525
that we need to build on now

37:06.558 --> 37:09.361
is to build a trust
amongst the people.

37:09.395 --> 37:12.931
There are lots of IDPs still
still in camps,

37:12.964 --> 37:14.633
and they could be given back
their lands

37:14.666 --> 37:17.969
that might be useful
to also jump start the economy.

37:18.003 --> 37:19.204
It should be a paradise, yes.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.307
I mean, look out the window.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.943
- Yeah.
- The potential is incredible.

37:35.921 --> 37:36.421
♪

37:44.530 --> 37:47.132
So, 20 years from now,

37:47.165 --> 37:48.734
are you optimistic
or pessimistic?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.101
What do you think?

37:50.135 --> 37:52.003
You have to be optimistic.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.172
You have to be.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.807
Empathy is everything.

37:55.841 --> 37:58.510
It's part of what
makes us human.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.679
That's what... there's where
we have to connect

38:00.712 --> 38:02.247
and understand each other.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.050
It's all very idealistic,
I know that.

38:13.559 --> 38:16.962
For some people,
the hurts are too deep.

38:16.995 --> 38:20.999
For some people,
it's too late for forgiveness

38:21.032 --> 38:22.834
or trust.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.302
You know, you have, for example,

38:24.336 --> 38:26.838
communities that have
been displaced

38:26.872 --> 38:29.875
13 times over the past 25 years.

38:29.908 --> 38:33.945
That's what you call
a breeding ground for...

38:33.979 --> 38:35.547
- Trouble, yeah.
- For trouble.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.120
Sri Lanka has been through
and endured a lot,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.456
far more than most.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.558
It's a lot to ask of any place

38:46.592 --> 38:49.561
to put aside such things
as hate, fear,

38:49.595 --> 38:51.797
a desire for revenge.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.565
It might still be too much,

38:53.599 --> 38:56.368
but there is indeed,
it appears, reason to hope.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.504
- Hi, Tony.
- How you doing, man?

38:58.537 --> 39:00.839
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

39:00.872 --> 39:03.809
This looks like grouper?
Yeah.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.744
You put it on banana leaf,
is it?

39:05.777 --> 39:07.078
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.922
Any fishermen here?

39:16.955 --> 39:18.557
Yeah, they're all fishermen.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.259
Okay, so what happened
during the war? Could you fish?

39:21.292 --> 39:23.495
- Yes.
- Straight through?

39:23.529 --> 39:25.497
They only have
to get the permission.

39:25.531 --> 39:28.434
Then they're limited
for one kilometer.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.336
Did people feel safe
anywhere to do what they did?

39:31.369 --> 39:32.871
Anytime nobody feels.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.607
Curfew was installed here.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.876
Four o'clock,
and you can be shot.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.345
These people have
to make a living.

39:40.378 --> 39:43.782
They have to catch fish
to feed their home,

39:43.815 --> 39:45.016
feed their families.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.217
So they have to go.

39:55.494 --> 40:00.231
- Oh.
- All right, what's up, bro?

40:00.265 --> 40:02.468
What's up, young man?

40:02.501 --> 40:03.769
Most of the world

40:03.802 --> 40:05.163
when you've been through
a struggle like this,

40:05.170 --> 40:07.639
so painful and so vicious,

40:07.673 --> 40:09.575
usually at the end of the day

40:09.608 --> 40:13.612
people cannot say,
"Look, I'm exhausted."

40:13.645 --> 40:15.313
Nobody wins here.

40:15.346 --> 40:16.882
We all want to live in a world

40:16.915 --> 40:18.817
where we can take care
of our children.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.219
Are we at that point
in Sri Lanka?

40:21.252 --> 40:25.156
Just now, people never beg,
but they will fight.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.159
Please look at the future.

40:28.193 --> 40:31.797
Don't let the young people
go take up arms.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.165
Invest, develop,

40:34.199 --> 40:35.834
give them some guidance,

40:35.867 --> 40:37.435
these people that ran a war.

40:37.469 --> 40:40.839
These guys have torpedoes,
submarines.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.574
Ingenuity.

40:42.608 --> 40:45.010
They were all so keen
about destroying the world,

40:45.043 --> 40:47.646
terrorism, destroying terrorism.

40:47.679 --> 40:51.082
They never value the strength
of the people.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.827
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.529
Is that how this ends?

41:03.562 --> 41:06.464
- That's the story.
- It's a little depressing, no?

41:06.498 --> 41:09.701
- How about a message of hope.
- Yes, yes, yes.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.805
Come on, let's talk about it.

41:17.075 --> 41:20.211
Okay, all right,
and then one day

41:20.245 --> 41:24.149
the civil war of lies
came to an abrupt end.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.786
Yay!

41:27.819 --> 41:29.387
Harsh question:

41:29.420 --> 41:33.291
Why should Americans
watching this,

41:33.324 --> 41:35.126
why should we give a shit?

41:35.160 --> 41:37.729
Why should people care
about Sri Lanka?

41:37.763 --> 41:40.465
I guess...

41:40.498 --> 41:43.401
I don't know why Americans
should care.

41:43.434 --> 41:46.071
I just want Sri Lankans to care.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.040
This story has to go on,

41:49.074 --> 41:51.142
and for it to go on

41:51.176 --> 41:53.912
we have to have some hope.

41:53.945 --> 41:59.184
Citizens were asked
for what they most desired.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.419
And that is how peace came

42:01.452 --> 42:04.690
to the island of short memory.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.758
The warring parties
fast realized

42:06.792 --> 42:11.262
that it didn't matter who won
or who lost

42:11.296 --> 42:14.099
because in the end

42:14.132 --> 42:16.401
they were all on the same side.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.890
So it's been eight or nine years

42:38.924 --> 42:41.459
since I've been

42:41.492 --> 42:45.964

44:00.405 --> 44:04.175
I started a theatre company
in 1999

44:04.209 --> 44:06.544
called Mind Adventures.

44:06.577 --> 44:08.546
When I was 16 years old,

44:08.579 --> 44:10.949
my first theatre teacher

44:10.982 --> 44:14.052
was abducted and murdered.

44:14.085 --> 44:16.822
His abduction wasn't the first,

44:16.855 --> 44:19.725

like me

44:19.758 --> 44:22.227

how can we do something,

44:40.611 --> 44:45.016
The main focus of the play,
"The Traveling Circus,"

44:45.050 --> 44:48.086
is the internally displaced
people.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.989
You know, at any given time
in Sri Lanka since the 1980s,

44:51.022 --> 44:55.727

Hurry up!
Don't waste my time.

45:03.068 --> 45:04.602
What's in the bag?
It's just some-

45:04.635 --> 45:07.272
- Can't take anything
inside the camp.

45:07.305 --> 45:09.174
Search this.
Hurry up, next!

45:09.207 --> 45:13.444

acknowledging what happened.

these terrible things

45:15.981 --> 45:17.783
happened to the people
of our country.

45:17.816 --> 45:22.620
But it is also trying
to offer some hope,

45:22.653 --> 45:25.023
and I think that's something

45:25.056 --> 45:28.860
that our company in general
and the play especially

45:28.894 --> 45:30.228
is trying to say.

45:30.261 --> 45:32.330
Never again.

What are we eating today,
by the way? What's good here?

45:41.472 --> 45:44.475
So all these kitchens
are run by Muslims.

45:44.509 --> 45:45.911
So there's no pork dishes here.

45:45.944 --> 45:47.445
A lot of seafood.

45:47.478 --> 45:49.047
Look out the window.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.983
Two of my restaurants
work on no freezers.

45:52.017 --> 45:54.786
We can have access
to great seafood any time.

45:54.820 --> 45:58.256

Put him on the table.

45:58.289 --> 46:00.558
Crabs.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.794
I will definitely take
one of those, thank you.

46:02.828 --> 46:05.763
It's delicious.
That is insanely good.

46:05.797 --> 46:09.400
This is, what,
a rice and curry restaurant?

46:09.434 --> 46:11.136
It's a typical Sri Lankan meal.

46:11.169 --> 46:14.505
Big heavy earthenware vessels
filled with delicious things.

46:14.539 --> 46:15.773
Yes.

46:15.807 --> 46:18.443
You have the vegetables, spicy,

46:18.476 --> 46:20.979
the chicken curry,
the fish curry.

I have three dogs,
and they don't eat dog food.

46:25.650 --> 46:27.018
- No.
- They only eat curry.
