02:00.537 --> 02:02.790
SHE LEFT THEM HERE LAST WEEK,

02:00.537 --> 02:02.790

02:11.172 --> 02:12.549
SHE KICKS MY ASS

02:11.172 --> 02:12.549
AT SCRABBLE.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.675
OH, YEAH?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.719
WHEN WE PLAY MONOPOLY,

02:13.717 --> 02:15.719
I RULE,

02:15.761 --> 02:18.639
BECAUSE SHE'S A KID AND HASN'T

02:15.761 --> 02:18.639
GOTTEN THE MONOPOLY CONCEPT.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.100
SHE STILL THINKS PARK PLACE

02:18.680 --> 02:21.100
IS A GOOD BUY.

READING THE RULES MANUAL

02:32.861 --> 02:34.029
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

RORY WAS OBSESSED

02:34.071 --> 02:35.864

02:35.906 --> 02:38.408
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA

ON YOUR CAMPUS SAFETY PIECE.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.535
FINE.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.496
UM, WELL,

04:03.577 --> 04:06.496
I THINK IT'S GOOD.

04:06.538 --> 04:07.831
IT'S REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY,

04:07.873 --> 04:09.583
UM, BUT THE LEAD'S

04:07.873 --> 04:09.583
A LITTLE FLABBY.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.502
GETTING INTO AN EXAMPLE MIGHT

04:09.624 --> 04:12.502
GIVE IT MORE PUNCH UP TOP.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.796
IF YOU SAY SO.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.796
ANYTHING ELSE?

04:14.838 --> 04:17.883
UH, SOME OF THE QUOTES READ

04:14.838 --> 04:17.883
TOO LONG.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.719
I'D CUT TWO OR THREE AND TRIM --

04:17.925 --> 04:20.719

04:20.761 --> 04:22.303
WHAT AM I DOING?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.889
YOU'RE NOT MAKING EYE CONTACT

04:22.345 --> 04:23.889
WITH ME.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.807
I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.807
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.642
WANT TO TEST ME?

04:25.849 --> 04:27.642

04:27.684 --> 04:30.062
HERE'S YOUR HARD COPY.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.062
I THINK THOSE NOTES WILL HELP.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.022
OF COURSE YOU DO.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.022
THEY'RE YOUR NOTES.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.691
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE<i> MY</i> NOTES,

04:32.064 --> 04:34.691
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD NOTES.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.902
SAYS THE NOTE GIVER.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.902
IT'LL TAKE HALF AN HOUR.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.403
FINE.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.075
THAT WAS UNPLEASANT.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.075
TRY SLEEPING WITH HER.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.952
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD

04:43.117 --> 04:44.952
FOR IT.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.037
NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE

04:44.993 --> 04:47.037
SHE DOESN'T SLEEP ANYMORE.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.914
SHE MAKES DAMN SURE

04:47.079 --> 04:48.914
I DON'T, EITHER.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.832
LAST NIGHT SHE DECIDED IT WOULD

04:48.956 --> 04:50.832
BE FUN TO WATCH "SAW II"

04:50.874 --> 04:52.667
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.128
THEN WHEN I WOKE UP AND ASKED

04:52.709 --> 04:54.128
HER IF SHE COULD TURN IT DOWN,

04:54.169 --> 04:55.629
SHE BERATED ME FOR BEING

04:54.169 --> 04:55.629
A FILM SNOB.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.089
HOW ARE YOU HANDLING IT?

04:57.131 --> 04:59.716
I BELIEVE THE TERM FOR IT IS

04:57.131 --> 04:59.716
"KEEPING MY MOUTH SHUT."

04:59.758 --> 05:01.135
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

04:59.758 --> 05:01.135
WITH HER.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.803
SHE'S ONE OF

05:01.176 --> 05:02.803
THE BEST REPORTERS WE HAVE,

05:02.844 --> 05:04.930
BUT SHE HAS GONE WAY BEYOND

05:02.844 --> 05:04.930
HER NORMAL LEVEL OF NUTS.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.182
SHE'S ON THE WARPATH RIGHT NOW.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.182
SHE'LL CALM DOWN.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.558
SHE JUST NEEDS SOME TIME.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.811
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I COULD

05:08.600 --> 05:10.811
GIVE HER MORE TO DO.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.813
THAT PIECE SHE JUST WROTE

05:10.852 --> 05:12.813
WOULD MAKE A GREAT SERIES.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.565
GIVING HER SOMETHING LIKE THAT

05:12.854 --> 05:15.565
MIGHT HELP HER REBOUND FASTER,

05:15.607 --> 05:17.442
MAKE HER

05:15.607 --> 05:17.442
THE NORMAL PARIS AGAIN.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.402
UM, SURE.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.196
THAT WASN'T

05:19.444 --> 05:21.196
VERY CONVINCING.
