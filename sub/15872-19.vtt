00:01.667 --> 00:04.291
[Emma]  A few months ago
I discovered I had
a twin sister

00:04.291 --> 00:07.208
and then she asked me
to take her place.

00:07.208 --> 00:11.250
Keep the secret,
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.500
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.375
How long could you keep up
the lying game?

00:16.375 --> 00:18.625
I wanna know what's going on
with you and Rebecca.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.000
Nothing is going on.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.500
I'd like to see this one.

00:24.166 --> 00:27.333
Guess who's
gonna be joining the band
at Coachella 2012?

00:27.333 --> 00:29.375
I think you look good
in just about anything.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.375
Always bugged
the crap out of me.

00:31.375 --> 00:33.291
I was there the night
that Derek got killed.

00:33.291 --> 00:35.667
-You saw who did it?
-He is the District Attorney.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.375
-Alec Rybak.
-Yeah.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.583
[Alec] Well, clearly,
somebody's playing me.

00:39.583 --> 00:42.708
Why didn't you tell me
that you were at the scene
of the crime that night?

00:42.708 --> 00:45.500
You have to believe me.
Sutton means nothing to me.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.959
[Sutton]
Thayer and I slept together.

00:48.417 --> 00:49.583
[judge] Case is dismissed.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.834
[Sutton]  I heard how weird

00:52.834 --> 00:57.166
Ethan was to you
at the courthouse,
and I think I know why.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.792
Ethan and I slept together.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.542
[Emma] It's just
a matter-of-fact, you know,

01:05.542 --> 01:07.208
the way that she said it.
Breezy almost.

01:07.208 --> 01:08.875
Like she forgot
to tell me she...

01:08.875 --> 01:11.041
Borrowed my sweater
or something.

01:11.041 --> 01:13.208
"Oh, by the way,
I slept with your boyfriend."

01:13.208 --> 01:14.542
But, Emma,
consider the source.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.375
She's probably making
the whole thing up.

01:16.375 --> 01:17.834
You were there.

01:17.834 --> 01:19.667
When Ethan blew me off
at the courthouse,

01:19.667 --> 01:22.750
when I looked into his eyes
he was not the person
that I fell in love with.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.834
-And you called him?
-Yes, four times.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.291
-No returns. I'm done.
-You know what?

01:27.291 --> 01:29.250
-Just stop the car.
-No, we're almost at school.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.417
I know,
but just pull over, okay?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.917
-Okay, get out.
-What are we doing?

01:39.458 --> 01:41.959
Changing places.
You shouldn't be driving.

01:41.959 --> 01:44.250
[Emma] Why? Because I'm
so clearly intoxicated?

01:44.250 --> 01:46.125
No, but you're having
boy troubles

01:46.125 --> 01:48.333
which is still
a crippling form
of impairment.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.291
[Emma sighs]

01:55.041 --> 01:56.583
[tires screeching]

01:56.583 --> 01:58.250
[Emma] What? What are we?
Where are you going?

01:58.250 --> 02:01.291
-Where do you think?
-Ethan's?

02:01.291 --> 02:02.750
No. Mads, we have school.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.083
No, screw school.
This is more important.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.208
Personally, I think
Sutton's full of crap.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.875
But either way,
that Ethan Whitehorse
is gonna man up,

02:09.875 --> 02:13.917
look you in the eye
and tell you the truth... Now.

02:13.917 --> 02:16.500
♪ Break it down
Let's get it on no escaping ♪

02:24.208 --> 02:25.500
No one's home.

Uh, yes, he is.
His Jeep's right there.

02:27.417 --> 02:28.792
You need to knock louder
like this.

02:28.792 --> 02:30.291
[banging]

02:31.792 --> 02:33.542
Mads.

02:33.542 --> 02:35.917
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, all right, already.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.542
Shouldn't you be in school?

02:39.542 --> 02:42.291
-I wanna talk to Ethan.
-Now's not the best time...

02:42.291 --> 02:44.083
What is that supposed to mean?
Is he here?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.750
-You should go.
-No.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.083
Not until I can talk to him.
He can't avoid me.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.291
-Ethan!
-Stop, stop.
All right, listen.

02:51.291 --> 02:54.750
Listen to me.
I tried reasoning with you
as a friend.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.166
This is the badge talking.
Go to school...

02:57.792 --> 02:59.166
Or I'll haul you in
for trespassing.
It's that simple.

03:04.166 --> 03:05.250
Wait, Sutton, wait.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.625
If you want me to give him
a message, I will.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.041
You can just tell him
I came
looking for some answers...

03:14.917 --> 03:16.083
And I got 'em.

It's my day off.
Shouldn't you be
at school, buddy?

03:47.917 --> 03:50.708
Mmm, I thought about it.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.375
Then I realized
I didn't feel like

03:52.375 --> 03:54.125
being the only former
murder suspect

03:54.125 --> 03:55.417
at the pep rally
this morning, so...

03:56.917 --> 03:58.458
All right, I get that.

03:59.875 --> 04:00.959
I gotta ask you, though.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.542
What's going on
between you and Sutton?

04:03.542 --> 04:05.166
Why'd you have me
send her away like that?

04:06.708 --> 04:08.333
Let's just say
I didn't feel like seeing her.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.458
Then you're an idiot.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.041
Oh, really?

04:12.041 --> 04:14.333
Yeah, she cares
a lot about you.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.834
She stood by your side

04:15.834 --> 04:17.708
when everyone else
had already written you off.

04:17.708 --> 04:19.166
A girl like that
in your corner,

04:19.166 --> 04:21.250
you don't just walk away, man.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.708
Believe me, I know.

04:22.708 --> 04:25.458
Trust me, Dan,
there's a lot you don't know.

04:26.917 --> 04:29.250
It's bad enough
he did what he did.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.083
I just can't believe
that he isn't man enough

04:32.083 --> 04:34.125
to look me in the eyes
and admit it.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.500
Yeah, at least
you tried to confront him.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.625
-Now that just leaves Sutton.
-What do you mean?

04:38.625 --> 04:40.417
Well, if it were me,
I'd slap the lips off

04:40.417 --> 04:41.959
of her smug little face.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.583
Ah, that's not
really my style.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.959
[bell ringing]

04:46.750 --> 04:49.291
Well, if it isn't
the elusive Madeline Rybak,

04:49.291 --> 04:50.750
ladies and gentlemen.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.291
You know,
I called you last night

04:52.291 --> 04:54.041
and the night before.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.917
I know, Ryan,
and I'm sorry
I haven't called you back.

04:55.917 --> 04:58.000
I've just got
a lot going on right now.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.500
No worries, I get it.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.750
But if you'd like to
make it up to me...

05:02.750 --> 05:04.291
Why don't we blow off
afternoon classes?

05:04.291 --> 05:06.333
I really can't.
I'm right in the middle
of something.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.000
Right. Hey, Mads.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.625
Would you excuse us
for just a moment?

05:15.708 --> 05:18.333
Okay, I'm confused.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.542
Is this because
I didn't tell you

05:21.542 --> 05:24.041
about Sutton coming on to me
at the Black and White Ball?

05:24.041 --> 05:26.125
-No.
-Then what?

05:27.959 --> 05:29.000
I can't tell you, but...

05:30.291 --> 05:31.750
Look, Ryan,
if you could
just be a little...

05:31.750 --> 05:32.708
Patient.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.750
I don't know, Mads.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.208
This is getting kind of old.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.959
Do you wanna be with me
or not?

05:40.959 --> 05:44.000
Because right now,
I'm starting to miss
those days

05:44.000 --> 05:46.834
where you'd just
make fun of me
to my face.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.458
At least then
I knew where I stood.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.041
I guess
I'm just a little worried
about somebody

05:57.041 --> 05:58.959
going to the police
with that picture.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.000
I mean,
it's pretty incriminating.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.333
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.667
If they were
gonna go to the cops,

06:03.667 --> 06:04.875
they would have done that
by now.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.375
It's somebody
just playing with me.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.750
Some fun.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.875
-What do we do now?
-Nothing.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.542
Just go on with our lives
as normal.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.875
Wait for them
to make the next move.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.041
And then what?

06:23.500 --> 06:24.917
Then we make sure
it's their last.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.417
Mmm.

06:30.542 --> 06:32.834
You're really not scared,
are you?

06:32.834 --> 06:35.125
I'm just grateful to have you
by my side on this one.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.458
I guess that's why
I like my odds.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.250
I better go.
I'm late for work.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.792
Hey, what are you doing there?

06:49.792 --> 06:52.250
Hey, what,
what are you doing home

06:52.250 --> 06:54.375
at, at 3:00
in the afternoon...

06:54.375 --> 06:57.041
Nothing.
I had a few things canceled,
thought I would come home,

06:57.041 --> 06:59.250
spend some time
with my beautiful wife.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.583
I'm actually kind of busy.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.959
I wish you had called
or, or some...

07:02.959 --> 07:05.625
Honey, what are you doing
with these?

07:05.625 --> 07:07.583
These are the files
for Justin's mother's case.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.125
-They were in my closet.
-Locked in your closet.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.959
This is my work.
You don't have any right...

07:12.959 --> 07:14.333
I have every right.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.834
I wanna know what happened
in the hospital, Ted.

07:15.834 --> 07:16.959
Honey, we've been over this.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.458
Is this about me
and Rebecca again?

07:18.458 --> 07:20.458
[Kristin] No, it's about us.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.917
[Ted] No, it's not about us.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.917
This is my issue.
This happened to me, okay?

07:23.917 --> 07:25.333
It affected
both of us back then,

07:25.333 --> 07:26.834
and it is affecting us now.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.041
Well, I'm sorry.

07:28.041 --> 07:29.458
I refuse
to keep reliving this.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.917
Emma, I was starting to think
you didn't get my message.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.375
No, I got it

07:46.375 --> 07:48.375
and actually I have something
I wanna say to you too.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.959
-What did you want?
-Oh, here.

07:52.959 --> 07:54.625
-That's for you.
-What is it?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.458
Cash. It's not much,

07:57.458 --> 07:58.875
but it's more than
what you came here with,

07:58.875 --> 08:00.875
and I figure it's enough

08:00.875 --> 08:02.625
to get you
where you need to go next.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.417
So, what?
This is your way of saying...

08:05.417 --> 08:08.250
Well, let's face it,
since you and Ethan
are finally done...

08:08.250 --> 08:10.458
You're kind of
running out of reasons
to stay.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.542
Right. Fine.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.959
Well, before I go...

08:15.959 --> 08:17.708
I just wanna
get to the bottom
of something.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.500
Great. I love it.

08:21.083 --> 08:21.875
Clearing the air.
Sit down.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.500
I wanna know what happened

08:24.500 --> 08:26.458
between you and Ethan
at that ranch.

08:28.667 --> 08:31.417
Are you sure, Emma?

08:31.417 --> 08:33.375
Because I would be
more than happy

08:33.375 --> 08:35.250
to give you the lurid details.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.000
You know, the blow by blow.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.166
I'm not asking for details.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.750
Fine, broad strokes then.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.041
Well, let's just say Ethan...

08:47.417 --> 08:48.458
Kissed me.

08:50.041 --> 08:53.166
And then he kissed me
and then he kissed me

08:53.166 --> 08:54.625
-and then he kissed me...
-[groans]

09:00.166 --> 09:01.959
Violence, Emma?

09:03.583 --> 09:04.625
Classy.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.667
Just goes to show

09:07.667 --> 09:09.959
that they can take the girl
out of the foster system,

09:09.959 --> 09:11.667
but you can't take
the foster system
out of the girl.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.834
You know what?
You can have Ethan.

09:14.834 --> 09:16.750
But as far as me leaving,
you can forget it

09:16.750 --> 09:19.000
because, Sutton,
you may be done with me,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.542
but I am nowhere near done
with this family.

09:21.542 --> 09:24.291
Really? And what is that
supposed to mean?

09:24.291 --> 09:26.375
It means I'm gonna come clean

09:26.375 --> 09:28.458
to Ted and Kristin
about everything.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.583
And you thought
I was running out
of reasons to stay.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.208
-Mom?
-Sutton.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.417
What are you doing here?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.542
Well, I just,
I wanted
to talk to you about...

09:55.417 --> 09:57.542
Are you okay?

09:57.542 --> 10:00.917
I'm, I'm fine.
I'm just,
I'm just exhausted.

10:00.917 --> 10:02.959
I... I don't know
why I thought
I could exercise today.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.959
Well, that doesn't explain
why you're crying.

10:06.959 --> 10:09.917
I'm... Sweetie, I'm not.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.834
I... I'm your daughter.

10:13.834 --> 10:16.250
If something is wrong,
I just wanna help.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.041
[sighs]

10:19.041 --> 10:20.500
Well...

10:22.708 --> 10:24.375
You know how I,
how I told Laurel

10:24.375 --> 10:25.875
she couldn't go to Coachella
with her band?

10:27.250 --> 10:29.250
Um, I've changed my mind.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.333
And... And I want you
to go with her.

10:32.667 --> 10:33.625
Okay.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.333
Why the sudden change
of heart?

10:37.583 --> 10:40.542
Well, I just think
it's a good opportunity
for Laurel.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.291
Why, why do I feel like

10:44.291 --> 10:45.667
there's something else
going on here?

10:47.959 --> 10:50.041
-It's not...
-Mom, please talk to me.

10:51.959 --> 10:54.291
Look, I heard you arguing
with Dad...

10:54.291 --> 10:55.333
About Rebecca.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.834
Honey, I don't,
I just don't wanna
discuss it anymore.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.458
It's between
your father and me.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.750
Oh, my God.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.125
You think Dad and Rebecca?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.875
I promise you, whatever it is,
everything's gonna be okay.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.792
-So do you think it's true?
-Damn it, Sutton.

11:42.792 --> 11:45.500
I mean, my dad and Rebecca.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.583
-How messed up is that?
-I don't know.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.834
It's... Pretty messed up.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.583
I guess I've always just taken
certain things for granted.

11:52.583 --> 11:54.667
Some of which
I know you have pointed out.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.208
But there was always one thing
I could count on.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.792
Yeah, well, I didn't really
see it coming either.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.542
I mean, they've always
seemed so in love.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.250
I know.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.417
So... What do we do now?

12:08.458 --> 12:09.750
I don't know.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.542
Wait... We?

12:16.333 --> 12:17.250
[scoffs]

12:31.542 --> 12:34.792
-Do I wanna hear this?
-Uh, maybe not.

12:34.792 --> 12:35.959
Um...

12:37.333 --> 12:40.291
Look, Ryan,
I still can't tell you
all the details

12:41.375 --> 12:42.542
but you wanted to know
what's going on.

12:43.375 --> 12:46.750
I've been really worried that

12:46.750 --> 12:49.333
someone very close to me...

12:51.000 --> 12:52.708
May have been involved
in something bad.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.667
And now I'm scared...

12:56.917 --> 12:58.458
That I'm about to find out
that they were.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.917
I just hate
that you don't think

13:01.917 --> 13:02.959
you can trust me, Mads.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.291
It is killing me
that I can't share this
with you.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.375
It's like
I'm pushing you away,
and I can't help it.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.041
It's... It's okay.

13:14.542 --> 13:16.291
So this, this person...

13:16.291 --> 13:18.750
If they actually
did something bad,

13:18.750 --> 13:20.667
don't you think
the truth's going to
come out eventually?

13:22.125 --> 13:24.959
Maybe. Probably.

13:24.959 --> 13:27.542
Well, then if it were me,
I think I'd rather know now.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.708
Find out the truth,
whatever it is

13:30.708 --> 13:32.500
and then deal with it.

13:50.000 --> 13:50.875
What are you doing here?

13:51.417 --> 13:52.500
You really have to ask?

13:53.708 --> 13:54.667
We have nothing to talk about.

13:55.625 --> 13:56.750
Are you kidding me?

13:58.083 --> 14:00.041
Everything is falling apart,

14:00.041 --> 14:02.250
and the one person

14:02.250 --> 14:04.333
that I tell everything to
is avoiding me.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.500
Fine.

14:07.250 --> 14:08.542
What do you want from me?

14:08.542 --> 14:09.625
I wanna hear you say it.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.875
I want you
to look me in the eye...

14:14.667 --> 14:16.125
And tell me what happened.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.583
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.291
I know you slept with Sutton.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.458
Slept with Sutt...

14:21.458 --> 14:23.041
I did not sleep
with your sister.

14:23.041 --> 14:24.542
Really?

14:24.542 --> 14:26.166
Then why are you
acting this way?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.792
Avoiding me at the courthouse,
dodging my phone calls.

14:28.792 --> 14:30.458
Why do you think?

14:30.458 --> 14:31.291
Because of what you did.

14:32.417 --> 14:33.625
The way that you told me that.

14:33.625 --> 14:34.792
I told you what?

14:34.792 --> 14:36.375
That you slept with Thayer.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.333
Thayer?

14:39.333 --> 14:41.208
I didn't tell you
I slept with Thayer

14:41.208 --> 14:42.625
because I didn't sleep
with Thayer.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.375
And the fact that
you even think that.

14:49.708 --> 14:50.792
What?

14:53.333 --> 14:54.375
Son of a...

14:55.000 --> 14:56.083
Sutton.

14:57.542 --> 14:59.166
I don't know
how I didn't know it was her.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.625
The guards wouldn't let us

15:00.625 --> 15:02.166
get close enough
to each other.

15:07.041 --> 15:08.792
I never, ever wanna
feel that way again.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.708
I'm so sorry for doubting you.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.000
Me too.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.750
It's just that
when you guys
were up at your dad's ranch,

15:16.750 --> 15:18.583
I just let my imagination
get the best of me.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.625
And I know,
I know that
nothing could have happened.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.375
Nothing did happen, right?

15:29.291 --> 15:31.208
No. Of course not.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.583
You promise, I know everything
there is to know?

15:40.583 --> 15:42.041
I promise.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.458
Okay.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.583
I just think
unless we all
start working together,

15:57.583 --> 15:59.083
we'll never get
to the bottom of this.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.875
No argument here.
Where's Mads?

16:00.875 --> 16:02.208
I texted her
that we were meeting here,

16:02.208 --> 16:04.375
but I wouldn't count on her.

16:04.375 --> 16:08.458
Aw! Look who
patched things up.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.125
Sutton, how long
did you think it would be

16:10.125 --> 16:11.583
before we figured out
what you did?

16:11.583 --> 16:13.208
Actually,
I'm kind of surprised

16:13.208 --> 16:14.625
it took you guys this long.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.750
You got some real issues,
you know?

16:16.750 --> 16:18.375
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Slap me again?

16:18.375 --> 16:19.959
Next time,
it won't just be a slap.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.625
Hey, nobody is gonna
slap anybody.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.417
Can we all just sit?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.792
Now?

16:26.792 --> 16:28.834
Thank you.

16:28.834 --> 16:31.875
All right, so it looks like
my dad's innocence or guilt

16:31.875 --> 16:33.625
comes down
to whether Rebecca was
telling the truth

16:33.625 --> 16:35.250
about where he was the night
of Derek's murder.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.875
So what do we know
about Rebecca?

16:37.875 --> 16:39.375
I don't know.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.917
But there's just
something about her.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.583
She showed up
at the birthday party,

16:42.583 --> 16:45.041
and all the adults
were acting strangely.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.000
Alec, Ted and Kristin.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.417
She has gotten close
to my dad really quick.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.375
Yeah, she hadn't been here
two weeks

16:51.375 --> 16:55.041
and Phyllis and Char
were gone,
and she moved into their home.

16:55.041 --> 16:57.750
I was talking
to Kristin yesterday
at the club and...

16:58.834 --> 16:59.834
Yes?

17:02.417 --> 17:03.834
Nothing, she...

17:04.750 --> 17:07.625
Said she never really
trusted Rebecca.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.333
Okay, so I guess we start
by doing some digging
on Rebecca.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.708
You're gonna have to do it
without me

17:11.708 --> 17:12.792
for a couple of days.

17:13.542 --> 17:14.875
Where are you gonna be?

17:14.875 --> 17:16.333
Well, in half hour,

17:16.333 --> 17:18.083
we are leaving for Coachella
with Laurel.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.041
-We?
-I'm going, too.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.917
Oh, of course you are.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.333
You do realize
you're gonna have to stay

17:24.333 --> 17:25.542
in the cabin
for a couple days?

17:25.542 --> 17:28.333
As opposed to driving
300 miles to the desert

17:28.333 --> 17:30.875
to hang out with a bunch
of sweaty, gross hipsters?

17:30.875 --> 17:31.834
Yeah, I'm good.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.083
Okay. Well, I guess
it's just the two of us.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.583
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.708
He may be our father, Thayer,

17:42.708 --> 17:44.500
but if he's done
anything wrong
we need to know about it.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.708
-You busy?
-Hey, Theresa.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.708
You didn't expect
to see me today, huh?

17:56.708 --> 17:59.500
Well, since my brother's case
was dropped, I figured...

17:59.500 --> 18:02.291
That we'd wait another seven
years until we hang out again?

18:02.291 --> 18:05.083
-No.
-If you want, I...
I can leave.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.291
No. No, I was,
I was just surprised.
That's all.

18:08.291 --> 18:11.250
Actually, uh,
I've been meaning to call you.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.875
Everything happened
so fast the other day

18:12.875 --> 18:15.333
I... I didn't get
to thank you.

18:16.583 --> 18:17.542
If you really
wanna thank me...

18:18.583 --> 18:20.041
You name it.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.375
Well, you know,
if memory serves

18:21.375 --> 18:22.500
you grill a pretty mean filet.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.750
How about tonight?
What do you say?

18:25.792 --> 18:27.500
I'd say it sounds
like you thanking me.

18:28.583 --> 18:29.500
I'll see you tonight.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.291
[woman] This is about my son,
Derek Rogers.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.333
I need to see
Officer Whitehorse.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.959
Schaub, it's fine. I got it.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.041
How can I help you, ma'am?

18:43.041 --> 18:45.708
You can start by telling me
what the hell is going on.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.458
Is anyone still looking
for whoever killed my son?

18:48.458 --> 18:50.417
Yes. I can assure you
we're doing everything we can

18:50.417 --> 18:52.000
to bring Derek's killer
to justice.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.083
Then some of you
have a funny way
of showing it.

18:54.083 --> 18:57.458
-I'm sorry?
-District Attorney Rybak.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.125
I've been calling him
for a week.

18:59.125 --> 19:02.125
Sometimes three,
four times a day.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.834
-The man won't return my call.
-Then I will call him myself.

19:04.834 --> 19:06.542
Because of whoever did this,

19:06.542 --> 19:07.959
my brother almost
went to prison

19:07.959 --> 19:09.458
for the rest of his life.
It's personal for me, too.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.417
I really do wanna believe you,
Officer Whitehorse.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.333
Oh!

19:22.333 --> 19:23.291
Great.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.875
Okay, something tells me
this never happens

19:27.875 --> 19:29.250
to Florence + the Machine.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.875
No, it'll be, it'll be fine.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.834
Ethan is really good
with cars.

19:32.834 --> 19:35.333
He can fix it.
You can fix this.

19:35.333 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, maybe.
Uh, Baz, you got any tools?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.250
I do. Oh, man, I took them out

19:40.250 --> 19:41.500
to make room
for the equipment.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.542
Awesome.

19:43.375 --> 19:46.792
Great. So now what do we do?

19:46.792 --> 19:48.208
Uh, considering
we haven't seen a car pass by

19:48.208 --> 19:49.834
in the last ten minutes,

19:49.834 --> 19:51.500
I'd say we start praying
for cell reception.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.667
[Alec] I gotta say, Dan,
I'm not sure I appreciate

19:56.667 --> 19:58.917
your just stopping by
like this.

19:58.917 --> 20:00.834
I have a secretary,
you know?
She's good.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.917
This is urgent.

20:02.917 --> 20:04.834
I got a visit
from Derek Rogers' mother.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.458
She's a little frustrated
about the lack of progress

20:06.458 --> 20:07.542
on her son's case.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.375
Well, I'm sure
you reassured her
by way of consolation

20:11.375 --> 20:13.625
that we're doing everything
we can, right?

20:13.625 --> 20:15.667
-Are we, Alec?
-Are we what?

20:15.667 --> 20:18.375
Well, with all due respect,
are you sure that I know

20:18.375 --> 20:20.375
all there is to know
about this case?

20:20.375 --> 20:24.041
There's no leads I don't know
about? No new suspects?

20:24.041 --> 20:27.208
Let me think. Uh, no.
You're up to speed.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.959
Why are you even
asking me that?

20:28.959 --> 20:30.875
Well, I don't know. I guess
I'm just a little confused.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.875
A little unsure
about a few things.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.375
Such as what?

20:35.375 --> 20:38.041
Well, for starters,
how did you track down

20:38.041 --> 20:39.875
my brother
at our father's house?

20:39.875 --> 20:41.667
And then when you seemed
so hell-bent

20:41.667 --> 20:43.333
on locking him up
and throwing away the key

20:43.333 --> 20:44.792
you dropped the case.
Why is that, Alec?

20:44.792 --> 20:48.708
First of all, Danny,
I'm not sure I like your tone.

20:48.708 --> 20:51.208
And second of all,
you're looking at the man
who bent over backwards

20:51.208 --> 20:53.208
to spring that punk brother
of yours.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.083
So before you come down here
to my place of employment

20:55.083 --> 20:57.542
and tell me how to do my job,
why don't you get off your ass

20:57.542 --> 20:59.250
and start doing yours?

20:59.250 --> 21:01.542
Find out
who really killed that kid.

21:03.166 --> 21:05.333
Honestly, Danny...

21:05.333 --> 21:07.083
I expect more out of you, son.

21:16.917 --> 21:20.375
This sucks. I can't believe
we're gonna miss our show.

21:20.375 --> 21:21.917
Well, you don't know that yet.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.583
Okay, bad news first.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.417
-Your van is quite broken.
-Yeah, that's not really news.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.041
Well, here's the good part,

21:29.041 --> 21:30.875
now you folks
could not have broken down

21:30.875 --> 21:33.333
in a more ideal county
for van servicing and repair.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.083
Not to brag, but I'm the best.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.625
How is that not bragging?

21:36.625 --> 21:38.875
So when do you think you can
have us back on the road?

21:38.875 --> 21:40.834
I got to pick up a few parts
from my supplier

21:40.834 --> 21:43.208
over in Rock Ridge,
he closed at 6:00,

21:43.208 --> 21:46.875
so I'd say
by tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.500
Well, that's great,
I mean, if we hurry

21:48.500 --> 21:50.083
we can still make it
to Indio for our set.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.333
Yay!

21:52.291 --> 21:54.375
Okay, so we'll just have
to make the best of it

21:54.375 --> 21:58.458
and see what Buford Falls
has to offer.

21:58.458 --> 21:59.667
We should start
looking into motels.

22:01.125 --> 22:02.166
Let's go.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.375
[Ted]  You know,
I was kind of surprised

22:05.375 --> 22:07.667
when you let the girls
go to that rock concert
in the desert.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.583
Well, I love
seeing them together.

22:09.583 --> 22:12.291
It was important
to Laurel and...

22:12.291 --> 22:13.667
It gives us a chance to talk.

22:15.041 --> 22:17.291
Absolutely.
What do you wanna know?

22:17.291 --> 22:19.375
You wanna talk about Justin,
hospital, anything?

22:21.333 --> 22:22.708
Did you sleep with Rebecca?

22:24.500 --> 22:27.625
[laughs] No.

22:27.625 --> 22:30.333
The deposition said
you received
an unsettling phone call

22:30.333 --> 22:33.250
when you scrubbed in
that afternoon,
something personal.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.500
I know Rebecca was living
in L.A. at the time.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.625
Why are you
bringing this up again?

22:37.625 --> 22:39.959
Because every time I do,
you shut me down.

22:42.125 --> 22:44.625
-I'm trying to protect you.
-Don't.

22:44.625 --> 22:46.500
Who was that phone call
from that day? Was it me?

22:46.500 --> 22:47.917
Were we in a fight
or something?

22:47.917 --> 22:49.959
-It wasn't you.
-Then what?

22:49.959 --> 22:51.708
Please, I'm begging you,
tell me.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.959
[sighs] Um...

22:57.959 --> 22:59.375
It was Dr. Rance.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.458
The fertility doctor?

23:04.291 --> 23:06.458
Remember that ultrasound tech
who said she was so sure

23:06.458 --> 23:07.792
we were pregnant?

23:07.792 --> 23:08.917
We'd been trying for so long.

23:10.166 --> 23:12.041
But you said we had to wait
until Dr. Rance could call

23:12.041 --> 23:13.208
to confirm it.

23:14.667 --> 23:16.417
You had been through so much.
We were out of money.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.208
It felt like
this was our last chance
at having a kid.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.083
That's...

23:24.083 --> 23:25.708
That's who the phone call
was from?

23:25.708 --> 23:27.458
Dr. Rance, when he called
to say there was no baby?

23:27.458 --> 23:28.667
That's the distraction?

23:30.041 --> 23:31.125
Yeah.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.542
It... It was my fault.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.000
Honey, no. No, no.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.250
That's exactly why
I didn't tell you.

23:41.625 --> 23:45.083
Honey... As a surgeon,

23:45.083 --> 23:47.708
it is my job
to put aside all distractions

23:47.708 --> 23:49.291
when I walk
into the operating room
and I didn't.

23:52.542 --> 23:54.583
I was young, I failed.

23:57.834 --> 24:01.333
[sighs] I had no idea.
I'm so sorry, Ted.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.625
I should've never said
those things.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.208
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

24:08.458 --> 24:09.458
Everything's gonna
be fine, honey.

24:10.875 --> 24:12.458
No more secrets, I promise.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.708
I just I can't believe
I lied to Kristin

24:21.708 --> 24:23.333
about something like that.

24:23.333 --> 24:25.291
I mean,
I guess I was just so focused

24:25.291 --> 24:28.083
on trying
to keep my family together,
I... I got desperate.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.750
You were just
protecting her, man.

24:29.750 --> 24:31.583
Think of it that way, okay?
She was getting too close.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.417
No, I can't think of it
like that

24:33.417 --> 24:35.208
rationalizing everything away.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.667
She deserves better than that.

24:44.041 --> 24:45.250
What's happened to us, Alec?

24:47.291 --> 24:48.708
Life.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.542
We're dealing with it
the best way we can.

24:53.875 --> 24:56.041
Trust me, I've got my own
little mini hurricane brewing.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.750
What? What's going on?

25:01.750 --> 25:04.125
Ah. It's nothing
I can't handle.

25:04.125 --> 25:05.750
And to tell you the truth,

25:05.750 --> 25:07.125
it's been nice
having Rebecca around.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.667
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.667
She's, uh, been
a pretty big help?

25:13.959 --> 25:15.333
You could say that.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.166
I'm sorry
I couldn't tell you the truth
at the time.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.875
I mean, trust me, I...

25:27.875 --> 25:29.333
I wanted to ditch the force
for college

25:29.333 --> 25:30.708
right along with you.

25:30.708 --> 25:32.125
I did, it's just...

25:33.583 --> 25:35.041
I guess Alec had
other plans for me.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.083
Okay, so wait.

25:38.083 --> 25:42.166
Some spoiled party girl
ODs on her mom's pain pills

25:42.166 --> 25:46.083
and Alec Rybak convinces you
that unless you sell your soul
to him,

25:46.083 --> 25:47.875
you're gonna take
the blame for it.

25:47.875 --> 25:49.417
I thought
he was doing me a favor.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.875
I guess with the benefit
of hindsight, though, right?

25:53.875 --> 25:56.583
You wouldn't have
chosen him over me?

25:58.542 --> 25:59.583
Yeah.

I should have stood up to him.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.542
I'm sorry.
But I was young.

26:13.834 --> 26:15.834
And we both know
how convincing Alec can be.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.750
Alec is a bully.

26:20.041 --> 26:21.875
And there's
definitely something

26:21.875 --> 26:24.708
about this Rogers case
that stinks.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.000
Yeah, all right.

26:29.834 --> 26:31.125
So what are you saying there?

26:32.792 --> 26:35.250
You want me to dig
a little further?

26:35.250 --> 26:37.667
Try and bring Alec down?

26:37.667 --> 26:39.458
-No.
-Whoa, what?

26:40.959 --> 26:45.083
I am saying that maybe we...

26:45.083 --> 26:47.041
Should at least think
about bringing him down.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.542
Together.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.625
It's gonna be weird
playing in front
of an actual crowd.

27:17.875 --> 27:20.125
You know,
people who don't go
to our school or...

27:20.125 --> 27:21.208

with our parents.

27:22.750 --> 27:25.291
Are you sure the butterflies
don't have anything

27:25.291 --> 27:26.792
to do with,

27:26.792 --> 27:29.125
say... Baz?

27:31.125 --> 27:33.250
Baz? What are
you talking about?

27:33.250 --> 27:35.834
Oh, come on.

27:35.834 --> 27:37.959
I see you guys together.

27:37.959 --> 27:39.291
I'm not blind.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.959
Okay, so?

27:40.959 --> 27:42.667
You should see the way
he looks at you.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.959
He doesn't even look
at his guitar like that.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.083
Yeah, maybe.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.000
I don't know,
there's just so many reasons

27:50.000 --> 27:51.834
not to go there, you know?

27:51.834 --> 27:55.500
Band chemistry for one.
Plus, it's too soon.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.500
I mean,
Justin only recently stopped

27:57.500 --> 28:00.041
leaving those
epic voice messages.

28:00.458 --> 28:01.667

28:01.667 --> 28:03.208
But enough about my love life.

28:03.208 --> 28:06.083
I wanna know
why you are still in here
with me.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.375
What do you mean?

28:09.375 --> 28:12.417
Well, we're in a motel,
we're at least 100 miles

28:12.417 --> 28:14.959
from any parental supervision,

28:14.959 --> 28:16.375
your boyfriend's
two doors down

28:16.375 --> 28:18.000
probably shirtless,
do I need to go on?

28:20.041 --> 28:21.625
It's complicated.

28:21.625 --> 28:24.083
And there's a reason why I am

28:24.083 --> 28:26.041
here with you and not Ethan.

28:27.041 --> 28:28.041
And that reason would be?

28:29.667 --> 28:31.750
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.166
Oh, try me.
What, are you guys fighting?

28:34.166 --> 28:35.583
-No.
-Got your period?

28:36.750 --> 28:39.000
-No.
-You already did it today?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.875
-No!
-Well, then what?

28:40.875 --> 28:41.750

on Rebecca?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.625
Multiple aliases?

29:04.625 --> 29:06.250
Dismembered ex-husbands?

29:06.250 --> 29:09.333
Ooh! Was she a porn star?

29:09.333 --> 29:11.041
-Nope.
-Hmm.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.625
Look, I hate
to break it to you,

29:12.625 --> 29:14.000
but everything she's told us
checks out.

29:16.041 --> 29:18.917
Marvin Jenns, ex-husband,
founder of Jenns Records.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.250
That's it?

29:24.250 --> 29:25.917
I was able to find
a red carpet picture

29:25.917 --> 29:27.875
of her standing next to Bono
and Kelly Clarkson.

29:27.875 --> 29:29.125
No, that's not helpful.

29:30.542 --> 29:32.417
Actually,
there is one more thing.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.291
Jenns is
a pretty high-profile guy.

29:34.291 --> 29:36.792
So you would think that
if there was a divorce,

29:36.792 --> 29:38.250
there'd be an article
or something about it.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.291
I haven't been able
to find anything.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.542
Do you think
maybe she's lying?

29:42.542 --> 29:44.250
Well, that would
certainly cast new light

29:44.250 --> 29:46.875
on her credibility
as my dad's alibi.

29:46.875 --> 29:49.417
Maybe we should just ask her
if she's still married.

29:49.417 --> 29:51.625
Or better yet,
we can ask him.

29:52.708 --> 29:53.583
Do you have his number?

29:54.959 --> 29:57.291
Other people do know
how to use Google.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.959
Okay. Is that...

This is Carmella.

30:10.959 --> 30:13.291
Yeah, hi.
Uh, is Marvin there, please?

30:14.125 --> 30:15.959
No, I'm sorry.
He's out of the country.

30:15.959 --> 30:17.500
May I take a message?

30:17.500 --> 30:19.166
Well, I just had
a few questions for him.

30:19.166 --> 30:21.166
I'm actually a friend
of his ex-wife, Rebecca.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.125
Oh, Rebecca. Oh, my God.
How is she?

30:24.750 --> 30:26.291
-Yeah.
-She's fine.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.041
She's great, actually.
Uh, she sends her best.

30:30.583 --> 30:34.041
Hi. Uh, uh, I'm also
a friend of Rebecca's.

30:34.041 --> 30:36.291
And... You two were close?

30:36.291 --> 30:38.917
Oh, yes, I was her housekeeper
for eight years.

30:38.917 --> 30:42.250
I was so sad
when she moved away
after the divorce.

30:42.250 --> 30:45.166
Can you tell me
where she's living now?

30:45.166 --> 30:47.875
-Phoenix.
-Oh, Phoenix. Thank God.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.417
Why are you so happy
about that?

30:50.417 --> 30:52.959
Well, she was always talking
about returning home.

30:52.959 --> 30:55.542
And the love of her life
was always in Phoenix.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.458
The love of her life?

30:59.458 --> 31:00.917
Well, she never told
me his name

31:00.917 --> 31:03.166
but, you know,
she always had
a photograph of his

31:03.166 --> 31:05.208
in a locket around her neck.

31:05.208 --> 31:07.542
And her husband
never even knew
that it opened.

31:07.542 --> 31:10.500
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say was calling?

31:12.250 --> 31:14.375
Just a friend.
Well, this man
that you're talking about...

31:14.375 --> 31:15.750
I... I'm sorry, I have to go.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.875

in Phoenix.

31:23.959 --> 31:25.708
I wonder who that can be.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.708
Well, it makes sense
that it would be your dad.

31:28.875 --> 31:30.750
I think we really need
to find that locket.

I thought I'd have you
on the road by now,

32:07.875 --> 32:11.083
but my guy gave me
a water pump for a '96
instead of an '81.

32:11.750 --> 32:12.625
Can't you get the right part?

32:13.792 --> 32:15.250
Not until tomorrow.

32:15.250 --> 32:16.917
Great. So much
for making the show.

32:17.875 --> 32:19.708
I guess so.

32:19.708 --> 32:21.750
Hey, there'll be
other chances, though.

32:21.750 --> 32:22.875
[man] Real sorry about that.

32:23.792 --> 32:25.583
So, uh,
you guys got yourselves

32:25.583 --> 32:27.458
some kind of
a musical combo, huh?

32:28.583 --> 32:30.583
We were supposed
to play Coachella today.

32:30.583 --> 32:31.875
Well, I don't know
what that is...

32:32.875 --> 32:33.959
But if you're looking
for a gig

32:33.959 --> 32:35.250
I might know of a place.

32:35.250 --> 32:36.583
What, a club?

32:36.583 --> 32:38.083
Well, it's not a club exactly.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.250
So, like, a house party?

32:40.250 --> 32:42.125
Actually more of a home.

32:44.041 --> 32:45.667
Ethan's just
grabbing something
from his room.

32:45.667 --> 32:46.875
Can we just wait a second?

32:46.875 --> 32:49.083
-What, are you kidding?
-What?

32:49.083 --> 32:50.834
Uh, Sutton and Ethan
have some stuff

32:50.834 --> 32:52.625
that they got to
take care of here.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.625
-What, you love him, right?
-Yeah.

32:54.625 --> 32:56.041
So what are you still
doing standing here?

32:57.250 --> 32:58.333
Go.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.083
You forget something?

33:08.166 --> 33:11.792
Uh, no. There's actually
been a change of plans.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.583
Oh, don't tell me
that guy didn't get
the van fixed.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.000
Actually, he didn't,
but it's okay,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.291
because the band found
another gig

33:16.291 --> 33:17.917
and I told them to go
without us.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.250
What? Why'd you do that?

33:21.625 --> 33:22.792
'Cause...

33:24.333 --> 33:28.083
Ethan, you and I
have been through
a lot together,

33:28.083 --> 33:30.250
but as much as we care
about each other,

33:30.250 --> 33:33.667
there is always something
that keeps us apart.

33:34.750 --> 33:35.750
Yeah?

33:36.708 --> 33:38.834
And every time it happens,

33:38.834 --> 33:40.959
we always say
that the timing is just wrong.

33:40.959 --> 33:44.041
And here we are, alone, and...

33:45.333 --> 33:47.041
Miles away from everything
and everyone,

33:47.041 --> 33:48.834
and I can't help but think...

33:51.667 --> 33:53.250
What?

34:03.625 --> 34:04.792
The timing is right.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.125
Oh, it's easy.

34:18.125 --> 34:20.041
You and Mads
will go over to Rebecca's

34:20.041 --> 34:21.542
where your father
is having dinner with her

34:21.542 --> 34:23.959
and confront them
for being involved

34:23.959 --> 34:26.208
possibly in Derek's murder...

34:26.208 --> 34:27.667
-No.
-Yes!

34:27.667 --> 34:29.166
And you'll leave
the back door open for me.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.542
I will go upstairs
and look for the locket.

34:31.542 --> 34:33.208
-No.
-Yes.

34:33.208 --> 34:35.458
No way,
it's already risky enough

34:35.458 --> 34:37.208
without having to worry
about someone seeing you.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.667
Well, then,
we'll do it together.

34:39.458 --> 34:40.875
Okay. You know what, Sutton?

34:40.875 --> 34:42.542
This really has nothing
to do with you.

34:42.542 --> 34:45.166
It's about my dad,
and it's about Rebecca.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.500
Well, fine,
but I can be moral support.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.250
[sighs]

34:51.834 --> 34:53.417
There is really no way

34:53.417 --> 34:55.583
that I am gonna talk you
out of this, is there?

34:55.583 --> 34:57.834
Mmm, yeah.
No chance in hell.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.250
Oh, okay.

35:18.708 --> 35:19.834
You sure about this?

35:20.667 --> 35:21.875
Positive.

35:32.792 --> 35:34.625

35:36.083 --> 35:37.333

35:39.041 --> 35:40.917
You seem... Elsewhere.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.750
I'm sorry.
Yeah, no, I've just...

35:45.750 --> 35:47.458
I'm just concerned
that I haven't heard

35:47.458 --> 35:50.041
from whoever it was
that sent that picture.

35:50.041 --> 35:52.041
You know? I thought by now
we'd have heard something.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.708
Oh, well, it's only
been a few days.

35:55.708 --> 35:57.792
We just need to be patient.

35:57.792 --> 35:59.667
You're right.
I know that makes sense.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
It's just that
if that picture gets
into the wrong hands

36:04.000 --> 36:05.458
I don't have to tell you.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.041
You know, I've spent
my whole career

36:07.041 --> 36:08.333
fighting for the good guys.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.041
This is how it's gonna end?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.333
You know, I just...
I'm all right.

36:14.333 --> 36:16.417
I'm just blowing off steam.
I'm okay.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.500
You know, I've been thinking
about this too.

36:20.708 --> 36:22.208
I might have a...

36:23.333 --> 36:24.834
Little solution.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.208
I'm all ears.

36:28.208 --> 36:31.000
You have to be willing
to think outside the box.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.083
Okay.

36:36.083 --> 36:38.250
So it's not
exactly Coachella.

36:39.041 --> 36:41.000
Well, maybe if you squint.

36:46.834 --> 36:48.291
Pretty sure that would require

36:48.291 --> 36:49.708
an impossible amount
of squinting.

36:52.375 --> 36:53.708
I hope you're not
too disappointed.

36:53.708 --> 36:55.083
I know
you've been waiting

36:55.083 --> 36:57.125
to play a show like that
a lot longer than I have.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.333
Well, to be honest, Laurel,
Coachella wasn't

36:59.333 --> 37:00.875
the only part of this trip
I was looking forward to.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.208
Really?

37:02.208 --> 37:03.667
Yeah. A chance to spend
a little time with you.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.708
I know that sounds
kind of dorky.

37:07.708 --> 37:08.917
Kind of?

37:10.208 --> 37:12.750
No, I've, I've had a lot
of fun with you, Baz.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.041
Well, I guess
we should get started.

37:14.875 --> 37:16.125
Uh, not yet.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.500
Okay, now I'm ready.

37:21.375 --> 37:24.542

We're Strangeworthy.

37:24.542 --> 37:26.333

Mads. Thayer. What's up?
What are you guys doing here?

38:47.667 --> 38:51.208
Hey, we actually had something
to talk to you about.

38:51.208 --> 38:53.000
And it's kind of important.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.708
Well, that's perfect timing

38:54.708 --> 38:56.333
because we also have something

38:56.333 --> 38:57.708
we would like to share
with you.

38:58.917 --> 39:01.959
-I... Okay.
-What is it?

39:01.959 --> 39:03.583
It's good.
It's good news.

39:04.667 --> 39:05.792
Honey?

39:07.083 --> 39:08.291
We're getting married.

-Wow.
-[Alec] Huh?

39:20.291 --> 39:22.375
[dramatic music]

39:22.375 --> 39:23.667
[Thayer] Find anything yet?

39:23.667 --> 39:26.667
[gasps] No, just that
her taste in jewelry

39:26.667 --> 39:28.166
scares the hell out of me.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.667
Yeah, well, this evening
is scaring

39:29.667 --> 39:31.000
the crap out of me too.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.458
My dad just proposed
to Rebecca.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.208
What?

39:35.208 --> 39:37.333
I... I'll explain later.
Did you find the locket?

39:38.125 --> 39:40.250
No. No, I don't
think it's here.

39:40.250 --> 39:42.083
And if it is, Rebecca
has it hidden somewhere.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.375
So let's just go.

39:43.375 --> 39:45.834
-Come on.
-What? No. No, no, no, no, no.

39:45.834 --> 39:47.750
Well, if that woman
is about to become my stepmom,

39:47.750 --> 39:49.208
I gotta figure this out
before anything happens.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.333
Shh.

39:52.166 --> 39:54.000
Besides, the locket has
to be here somewhere.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.250
Well, I looked over here.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.750
What's that?

40:02.792 --> 40:04.208
How did I miss that?

40:04.208 --> 40:05.417
I don't know.

Oh, my God.

41:35.458 --> 41:37.959
What? Why?

41:43.959 --> 41:45.375
I haven't been honest
with you about something.

41:47.583 --> 41:49.291
Something I should
have told you.

41:52.083 --> 41:53.500
What are you talking about?

41:56.500 --> 41:58.250
The other day you asked me
if anything happened

41:58.250 --> 41:59.667
on the ranch with Sutton.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.166
You slept with her?

42:03.166 --> 42:05.041
No, I didn't.

42:06.667 --> 42:07.792
But we kissed.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.959
And for a little while,
things between us...

42:14.417 --> 42:15.708
Were complicated.

42:17.875 --> 42:19.875
Complicated?
What does that mean?

42:22.000 --> 42:23.917
I was on the run
and there was all this stuff

42:23.917 --> 42:25.083
going on with my dad.

42:26.417 --> 42:27.417
But it's over now.

42:29.083 --> 42:31.500
It's over?
How can you even say that?

42:31.500 --> 42:32.750
-Because it's true.
-No!

42:36.917 --> 42:39.208
It... This is
never gonna be over.

42:39.208 --> 42:42.834
As much as you deny it
and as close as we get,

42:42.834 --> 42:45.750
and as... As much as you
tell me that you love me...

42:48.333 --> 42:50.583
There's always gonna be
a part of you that wishes...

42:52.375 --> 42:53.708
That you could be with her.

43:00.041 --> 43:01.166
What do you want me to say?

43:04.166 --> 43:05.417
Nothing.

43:07.834 --> 43:09.375
Nothing. Actually, I am...

43:10.500 --> 43:13.166
I am grateful to you.

43:14.417 --> 43:15.583
For what?

43:16.834 --> 43:18.583
For keeping me from making

43:18.583 --> 43:20.041
the biggest mistake
of my life.
