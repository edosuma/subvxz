00:02.080 --> 00:03.360
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.520 --> 00:06.400
I went through the books. Mackey
was talking to a drug dealer...

00:06.560 --> 00:09.560
- Name's Rondell Robinson.
- Mackey's working for a drug dealer?

00:09.720 --> 00:12.520
The drug dealer's working for Mackey.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.400
- What do you get out of this?
- A dirty cop off the street.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.200
You wanna be mayor some day?
Better learn to lie a lot better than that.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.680
I came up the ranks with Vic.

00:28.880 --> 00:32.520
We can't be accused of whitewashing.
Last thing this department needs...

00:32.680 --> 00:35.080
...is to add another chapter to the
Rodney King O.J. Book.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.440
- I don't wanna be in that book.
- My source at Justice is all over me.

00:38.600 --> 00:42.320
He wants to know if you made us
all accomplices to a murder.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.480
Terry got overeager.
He got himself killed.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.200
- End of story?
- End of story.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.240
- I know what you did.
- Up until now I've tolerated you.

00:50.440 --> 00:54.840
Come near my men again,
I'm gonna lose patience.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.800
- You listening?
- I know.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.720
Damn, girl! That's what I'm
talking about.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:16.680 --> 01:19.840
Don't shake that in my man's face.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.560
- Who are all these white folk?
- They're from the record label.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.360
Oh, yeah. Give me that, girl. Yeah.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.440
- How does she move like that?
- That's what the guys like.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.720
Sir...

01:36.920 --> 01:39.960
You've had too much to drink.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.200
Who are you?

01:42.400 --> 01:45.240
- I'm a cop.
- You undercover?

01:45.480 --> 01:48.120
Security. So behave yourself.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.520
Everybody put your hands together
for all the ladies shaking it up in here.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
Word up!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.160
Word up, y'all.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.880
I wanna thank everybody for coming
out to my album release party.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.760
"Back From the Ashes,"
you know what I'm saying?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.800
- Feels good to be back behind the mike.
- Hey, Kern!

02:10.000 --> 02:13.520
- Do that duet with Tyesha.
- Rondell in the house.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.680
Where Tyesha at? Where Tyesha at?
Come here.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.040
This is Kern's party, y'all.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.320
My release party ain't gonna be
for another month.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.560
- Trouble.
- You can hear me sing then.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.800
- Tonight's Kern's night.
- Where my money, Kern?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.040
Yo, there go the thief right there.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.080
I want my money, homey.
Where my money, Kern?

02:34.240 --> 02:36.240
- Hey, yo. Hey, hey, hey.
- I want my money.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.120
- My beef ain't with you, playboy.
- What?

02:38.320 --> 02:40.760
- If it's with Kern, it's with me.
- Hey, back up.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.840
This is a private party.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.280
You can't get into trouble.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.040
Do I have to call in the cavalry?
Step back.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.360
Police can't protect you forever, Kern.
Remember that.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.920
- Get out of here. Go.
- It's T-Bonz, homey.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.640
- Punk ass out of here, man.
- You heard me. Go.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.680
- Get lost, bitch.
- Who you calling a bitch?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.840
Stay down! Shit!

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
Danny, you all right?

03:14.120 --> 03:16.800
Hey, man, those fools were shooting
up in here.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.560
- Lemon!
- Somebody call 911!

03:21.600 --> 03:23.520
Rumble in the jungle.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.880
- What happened?
- Two dead, six wounded.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.400
T-Bonz and his crew
were looking for a fight...

03:30.600 --> 03:32.920
...and Rondell and some of Kern's guys
gave it to him.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.040
- Don't tell me.
- Rondell was the shooter.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.720
It's just what we needed.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.680
Hey. Hey, Vic.
You're missing all the fun.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.200
Dutch, how many times I got to tell you,
you can't feel up the witnesses.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.920
- Took one in the ass. Bet it's not...
- It's not the first time. Good one.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.560
Uh-oh. Look who's the last one
to a "shots fired" call.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.160
All safe and secure, captain.
Shooting stopped.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.360
Nothing to worry about here.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.440
You two were moonlighting?

04:02.600 --> 04:05.360
Our shift commander signed off on it.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.160
Any suspects in custody?

04:07.800 --> 04:10.720
Well, the night is young.
Let me do my thing.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.600
Do you mind if I include others
in this investigation?

04:13.800 --> 04:16.240
You sign the checks.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.320
Pete and Dutch team up.
Strike Team will assist as they see fit.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.160
Any problems with that?

04:22.320 --> 04:24.400
Just that time's a-wasting.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.960
I won't put up with shooting galleries
in Farmington.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.320
Find out who pulled the triggers
and bring them in.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.440
Knute Rockne, he ain't.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.760
I may have to put up with you
working under my roof...

04:40.520 --> 04:42.840
...but it's still my roof.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.120
So just do your job...

04:45.280 --> 04:47.360
...and stay out of my way.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.680
Sounds like good advice for both of us.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.320
Let's get to work.

05:11.200 --> 05:11.360
- The guy throwing the party...
- Kern Little.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.240
- The guy throwing the party...
- Kern Little.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.960
And this T-Bonz,
they weren't the shooters?

05:16.120 --> 05:19.960
- Not that I saw. Just their pals.
- Can you ID any of them?

05:20.120 --> 05:23.440
- I can look through the books.
- This will spill into the street quick.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.680
Let's talk to both generals,
get them to stand down their armies.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.120
- Starting where?
- Kern Little.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.960
- Who's Kern Little?
- Listen, Dutchboy...

05:31.120 --> 05:35.640
...don't get your clogs all dirty.
We'll deal with Kern Little.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.280
- Who is it?
- Open up, Rondell.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.000
- What's up, Vic?
- Why'd you shoot up the Chez Club?

05:44.160 --> 05:49.000
Hey, man, T-Bonz and Kern
got this war going on, man.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.720
- I'm just backing up my boy.
- Who's that? Kern?

05:51.880 --> 05:55.200
- Hey, this thing high-def?
- Yeah. Don't get your prints on it, man.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
Sweet.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.280
Look, me and Kern, we been hanging
since we was kids. We're still tight.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.360
Don't you mean Kern financed
your entry into the drug business?

06:04.760 --> 06:07.160
Yeah. No comment.
But that's the rumour.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.760
What's the beef between
Kern and T-Bonz?

06:09.920 --> 06:13.960
T-Bonz was on Kern's record label.
Then he started selling a lot of discs.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.920
T-Bonz split, start his own outfit.
Hey, bad blood ever since.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.520
- Hey, what's with all the vinyl here?
- Hey, hey, hey, it sounds better.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.920
Would you put those back
the way you found them.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.000
That's my Blue Note collection.
I got them chronological from...

06:27.120 --> 06:30.200
- Did you hit anybody last night?
- Look, if somebody got smoked...

06:30.360 --> 06:33.040
...it wasn't me. I was just shooting
to be shooting.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.000
Give me your piece.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.440
Come on, come on, just give it to me.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.320
Keep your dealers inside
until I give the all clear.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.320
- I don't want more targets on the street.
- Vic, man, come on.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.280
Business is going to take a big hit.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.560
Then take it.
You get to deliver product...

06:50.720 --> 06:54.000
...only so long as this neighbourhood
doesn't resemble the Gaza Strip.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.960
Now, that was our deal. You remember?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.920
Yeah, I remember.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.200
Set up a meet. Me and Kern Little.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.200
- Man, why you need me to do that?
- You two are buds.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.200
- I want it to be on friendly terms.
- Anything else, man?

07:07.360 --> 07:10.600
Yeah. I need two shooters
from your side.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.080
Oh, come on, man, you kidding.
Come on, man. No.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.040
Is it gonna be you?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.760
And I run your gun through ballistics?
Huh?

07:19.920 --> 07:21.440
Or you got some names for me?

07:22.320 --> 07:26.080
- Welcome to the Barn.
- Make yourselves at home.

07:28.280 --> 07:32.560
Just doing my job.
And staying out of your way.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.680
- You look great.
- Stay focused.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.160
Now, he owns three different
car dealerships.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.400
Him, a chain of grocery stores.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.440
There's more money here
than in Mexico City.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.080
- Which one's Machado?
- Right there.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.520
This whole thing is his baby.
You better say hi before he disappears.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.600
- Okay.
- Remember how we talked about it.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.480
- I'll wing it.
- David...

08:01.640 --> 08:05.160
- I'm joking.
- This could be your one chance.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.800
- You ready?
- As I'll ever be.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.960
SeÃ±or Machado. I'm David Aceveda.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.800
Our young police captain. Welcome.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.920
It's an honour to meet you.
This is my wife, Aurora.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.200
What a wonderful
housing development.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.080
It's a step forward in improving
our neighbourhood.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.000
- I'm glad you both could come.
- Thank you for including us.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.960
I'm in your debt.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.320
Don't think me overly generous, David.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.039
As you'll discover,
I often have ulterior motives.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.159
You see, you're actually in a position
to help me.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.400
How so?

08:37.559 --> 08:41.159
My nanny hasn't seen her husband
since he left the house a few days ago.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.480
He's a day-worker.

08:42.640 --> 08:46.920
Waits for jobs by the home
improvement centre in your district.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.560
- Well, is this absence unusual for him?
- Not exactly.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.120
They are an emotional couple.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.880
They fight, he leaves, he comes back.
But he has never been gone this long.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.880
My nanny's quite upset, which means
my wife is upset, which means...

09:03.040 --> 09:06.240
I don't have to tell you
what that means.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.280
Just give me the pertinent information.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.040
I'd be glad to help.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.200
Looks as if I am now in your debt.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.360
- You listening to this?
- It's sweet.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.920
Sing me a song about last night.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.040
Man, that'd be a short-ass song.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.680
As soon as I seen them dudes coming
with them big guns...

09:31.160 --> 09:33.760
...I just got Tyesha the hell up
out of there.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.360
Nice place.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.480
I told everybody my first studio
gonna be in Farmington.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.960
You can't record a hardcore
hip-hop song working in Bel Air.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.320
- You got to keep it in the 'hood, baby.
- How am I sounding, baby?

09:46.480 --> 09:47.880
What?

09:48.040 --> 09:51.520
Like 2 million CDs, double platinum.

09:51.680 --> 09:55.080
- Tyesha, this is officer...
- I'm Vic. Just call him Lemonhead.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.960
- Hey
- Hey. This is Rocco.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.440
It's a madhouse out there. How'd you
get past all the photographers?

10:02.600 --> 10:05.880
We called ahead. Kern let us use
the security entrance.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.760
Kern's not under arrest, is he?

10:08.960 --> 10:11.880
Unfortunately for those
tabloid hacks, no.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.920
- We just needed a statement.
- Which I gave.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.960
- And his help with this war.
- Well, it's not Kern.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.640
It's his boys trying to protect him.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.240
T-Bonz is just plain crazy.
Everybody knows that.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.840
Don't worry about T-Bonz,
we'll deal with him.

10:28.680 --> 10:32.360
I need you to give the word
to your crew. The war is over.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.600
Right after T-Bonz gives his word.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.160
I mean, T-Bonz's the one that
spilled blood on my turf.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.880
I'm nothing if not a man of peace.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.560
Dutch?

10:46.720 --> 10:49.840
I'm running known associates
on the shooters Mackey brought in.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.840
We ever getting DSL around here?

10:52.040 --> 10:55.200
This is Ellie Ruiz.
I need you to help her out.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.600
- I'm working the Chez Club.
- Shockley can handle it.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.680
I need you to help find Ellie's husband,
Manuel.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.800
I can't believe we're doing this
for some fat cat's nanny.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.280
- You'd be happier if it was a mistress?
- It's abuse of power.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.200
Oh, you're upset
you got pulled off a big case.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.920
We're Aceveda's errand boys.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.400
Meanwhile, watch him cash in
on our hard work.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.120
So looking for a missing
migrant worker isn't important?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.280
- You do all the talking.
- Why me?

11:26.440 --> 11:27.600
You speak Spanish.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.160
How can you be a cop in L.A.
For 12 years...

11:30.320 --> 11:33.400
...and not speak any Spanish?
- All my partners spoke Spanish.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.640
- Besides, I know a phrase or two.
- Right.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.720
Yo no sÃ© means: I don't know.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.560
You hear it enough, it sinks in.
Missing hombre?

11:42.720 --> 11:44.640
Yeah.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.160
Manuel Ruiz?

11:53.360 --> 11:56.400
- There.
- Hey, hey!

11:56.600 --> 11:59.400
Hey, hey. You, amigo. Amigo.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.640
What's your name?

12:02.960 --> 12:05.800
Come on. You wouldn't be
sneaking away if you yo no sÃ©'d.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.960
Now, you know Manuel, don't you?

12:11.560 --> 12:12.960
Yes.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.880
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- What?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.160
Back up!

12:19.040 --> 12:20.080
Let's roll, man!

12:20.200 --> 12:24.440
Don't you make me break a sweat
trying to catch you!

12:26.160 --> 12:29.080
What the hell are you doing out?

12:29.280 --> 12:31.600
- Business.
- Rondell ordered you off the street.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.440
- No, not us.
- Run on home.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.800
What I'm gonna tell the boss?

12:38.960 --> 12:40.240
I am the boss.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.840
- What I'm gonna tell Rondell?
- Don't worry. I'll tell him for you.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.200
- What's up, man?
- I saw two of your guys on the street.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.640
- Man, it's a free country.
- Nothing's free.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.560
I'm your landlord, Rondell.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.120
I let you use space that I own.

12:56.280 --> 13:00.080
Now, you can't follow by my rules,
then I'll find someone who can.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.600
- You got me?
- I got you.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.800
Now, smart-ass, who else
you got dealing and where?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.320
Manuel got picked for a job
on Tuesday, along with another man.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.160
- Eduardo Salcido.
- Salcido.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.520
Any connection between this Manuel
and Eduardo?

13:17.680 --> 13:21.200
- They were best friends in Mexico.
- Even snuck into the country together.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.120
Something happened
on that truck ride.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.280
Ever since, Eduardo's been
telling people he's gonna kill Manuel.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.440
We know who hired the two of them?

13:28.600 --> 13:32.040
- Truck logo said Jamison Contracting.
- Well, track it down.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.120
Find out if they ever
showed up for work.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.400
All units, code 213,
intersection of Alvarado and Pine.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.560
That's our corner.

13:40.760 --> 13:44.360
Goddamn it! He had to leave his guys
on the street!

13:44.520 --> 13:46.320
Punch it!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.040
Police!

14:10.600 --> 14:12.760
Down there.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.680
Call EMT!

14:32.640 --> 14:33.760
Oh, man.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.080
The mayor knows the little boy, Vic.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.360
You're shitting me.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.760
Belongs to his golf buddy's
second cousin or some such thing.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.600
Whatever. He's invested.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.320
Any word on the kid's condition?

14:58.480 --> 15:01.440
He's busted up pretty bad.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.640
So I got nothing good to tell the chief.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.160
How do I explain
these four dead thugs?

15:10.360 --> 15:13.120
A war. Two rappers.
I know who they are.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.000
Look, I'm handling it.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.680
I told the chief the Strike Team
would make a difference.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.840
That these things will stop.
I'm not seeing the difference.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.800
Temporary setback.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.360
The chief allows me to appropriate
funds for you based on results.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.160
If I can't defend you,
I can't afford you.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.200
Vic.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.960
- Thought you should know.
- Know what?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.360
Kid was DOA.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.880
I'm handling it.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.400
Knock, knock.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.960
Have a seat.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.360
- All right.
- Tough guy.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.560
This war ends right here
with a handshake.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.480
This fool stole my money
and my woman...

16:07.600 --> 16:09.400
...and you expect me
to be a gentleman?

16:09.520 --> 16:13.160
- What, Tyesha was your woman?
- Hell, yeah.

16:13.920 --> 16:18.120
- We're not signing autographs, ladies.
- Okay.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.000
So basically, this is a dick wagging
contest over a piece of ass?

16:23.200 --> 16:24.920
This ain't about no piece of ass.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.760
- It's about $2 million that fool owe me.
- Two million dollars?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.400
- What 2 mil?
- Tyesha's money from the last CD.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.240
I broke her. Where my cut?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.400
First up, calm down, money.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.680
I'm a businessman.
I can be fair.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.960
But $2 million,
you must be smoking crack.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.640
I'll give you a finder's fee.
Straighten you out.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.440
I'm doing your punk-ass a favour.
You owe me at least 10.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.400
You know what, T?
I'm gonna keep it real with you.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.320
Tyesha wasn't even selling records
till I hooked her up. And that's real.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.560
- Oh, is that real?
- Hey, look, look, look.

16:56.720 --> 17:01.680
Your 10 lawyers can do battle with his
10 lawyers or we can settle this here.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.119
- I'm gonna get my money, bitch.
- Over my dead body.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.280
- Damn, that sound like a good idea.
- Shut up!

17:07.920 --> 17:09.280
Here's the deal.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.760
Kern, you take tonight,
come up with a number.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.400
You revise yours down a bit.
You bring me the numbers...

17:17.599 --> 17:19.720
...I'll decide what's fair.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.400
And who you supposed to be?
Judge Judy?

17:24.880 --> 17:29.120
I'm an impartial arbitrator with the
power to throw your asses in the can.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.680
Now, I'm calling a 24-hour cease-fire.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.520
Your boys break it, I break you.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.520
Same goes for you.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.160
This war ends here.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.840
They come here of their own accord.
Nobody's coercing them.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.560
Family of five moving to another
country just to eat isn't coercion?

17:52.760 --> 17:57.200
You know why they come here?
Five words: Free market's rule of law.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.880
Those things create prosperity,
which creates jobs people want.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.680
Forty dollars for a full day's work
isn't prosperity.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.400
It's exploitation and you wouldn't do it.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.840
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.360
Yeah. We're looking for a worker
named Eduardo?

18:13.040 --> 18:15.360
Throw a rock, you're bound to hit one.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.480
Have you seen this guy?

18:18.680 --> 18:21.160
- Yeah. Jose.
- Manuel.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.200
Yeah. He showed up a few days ago,
worked for one day, got paid...

18:26.360 --> 18:28.040
...never saw him again.
What did he do?

18:28.200 --> 18:30.200
Have any idea what happened
after he left?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.880
Don't know, don't care.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.440
Mind if we ask around for Eduardo?

18:35.640 --> 18:38.480
- Ask away.
- Thanks.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.840
Eduardo?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.720
- Eduardo?
- Eduardo?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.480
Eduardo?!

18:50.960 --> 18:55.200
It's not me. I think he's working
down over there.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.360
Hey! Stop!

18:59.560 --> 19:01.160
I said, stop! Hold it right there!

19:01.680 --> 19:04.000
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

19:15.400 --> 19:17.680
Hey, San Salvador is that way!

19:18.720 --> 19:20.880
These the triggermen at the Chez Club?

19:21.080 --> 19:23.080
Some of them, I think. Happened fast.

19:24.120 --> 19:28.440
Rondell Robinson.
You saw him firing the gun in the club?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.280
Yeah.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.120
- Beautiful.
- You know who he is?

19:35.280 --> 19:36.960
Yes, I do.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.800
Let's make this short and sweet.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.440
Wherever you think I was, I wasn't.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.640
- Whatever you think I did, I didn't.
- That's your story?

19:45.840 --> 19:48.520
- Cover to cover.
- I wouldn't plan on selling movie rights.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.960
Guess I'll just have to settle
for starring in it.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.280
You're a murder suspect, Rondell.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.680
I've got a witness saw you
pull the trigger at the Chez Club.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.960
Yeah, right. What witness?

20:01.160 --> 20:04.600
A cop. And a jury's gonna love her.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.440
- I got a phone call coming, right?
- You've only got one thing left to deal.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.680
- That's who's giving you protection.
- I don't need no protection.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.640
Even if we can't tie you
to one of the dead bodies...

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
...discharging a firearm
in a crowded club...

20:22.160 --> 20:24.240
Bye-bye, Rondell.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.680
So about that phone call.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.160
If you think that you can sell drugs...

20:31.320 --> 20:34.600
...and commit murder in my district
because a cop's protecting you...

20:34.760 --> 20:37.080
...you're dead wrong!

20:37.280 --> 20:40.320
- I thought I told you to lay low.
- I was listening to Miles Davis...

20:40.480 --> 20:43.200
...when this captain shows up.
- He get anything?

20:43.360 --> 20:46.480
No. I always keep my crib clean.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.520
But he's got a serious bug up his ass
about some cop protecting me.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.640
Just keep your mouth shut.
I'll handle Aceveda.

20:53.840 --> 20:57.880
We have indications Manuel's
disappearance may involve foul play.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.960
- Really? You don't know for sure?
- We have a suspect.

21:02.120 --> 21:06.400
He won't be able to elude us for long.
Once we capture him, we'll know more.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.640
Thank you for making this a priority.
You keep me apprised?

21:10.680 --> 21:13.080
Of any developments.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.200
Is there something else?

21:19.800 --> 21:22.520
At the risk of having
an ulterior motive myself...

21:22.680 --> 21:24.400
Yes.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.320
I know police officers aren't accorded
the same respect in this community...

21:28.520 --> 21:31.640
...as they were a decade ago.
- An unfortunate development.

21:31.840 --> 21:36.560
However, Latinos are a plurality
in Los Angeles...

21:36.760 --> 21:38.800
...and in this district.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.160
There is going to be a seat opening up
on the City Council next year.

21:43.560 --> 21:46.840
It's traditionally been filled
with a black candidate.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.840
I think it's our time.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.240
I agree.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.400
With your backing...

21:55.560 --> 21:57.760
...I could win that seat.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.880
I could be of great use to you.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.440
I like you, David, quite a bit...

22:07.600 --> 22:10.320
...but I don't think I can sell a cop
to these voters.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.520
Not here, not now.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.200
Who knows? Maybe in time,
things will become much different.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.480
Until then, I'm sorry.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.280
What would you think of a man
who exposed corruption?

22:21.440 --> 22:24.120
Brought down dirty cops
from inside the department?

22:24.800 --> 22:27.680
I'd think he was committing
professional suicide.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.920
But couldn't you sell him to the voters?

22:33.240 --> 22:34.920
Absolutely.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.760
- We got a call about a kidnapping.
- They took my boy, Thurman.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.440
When did you find out
he was kidnapped?

22:41.560 --> 22:42.600
Today.

22:42.720 --> 22:47.640
I got a ransom call asking
for $10,000. I don't have it!

22:47.840 --> 22:50.680
- When did you last see Thurman?
- Three weeks.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.120
- How long has he been missing?
- Since last night.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.960
- The last time you spoke?
- A month ago.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.120
Then how do you know he's only
been missing since last night?

22:59.320 --> 23:02.160
Cemetery called.
Somebody dug up his body.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.960
- Thurman's dead?
- Going on three weeks.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.520
- Code four, cancel that backup, please.
- Roger that. Ten- four.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.360
Ma'am, if the kidnapper calls back,
call us.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.640
You're not gonna help me?

23:19.680 --> 23:21.840
To be honest,
they'll push it to the bottom.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.880
Detectives, they have more important
things to do.

23:26.080 --> 23:30.080
But it's a crime, isn't it? Digging up
my son, holding it for ransom?

23:31.720 --> 23:35.680
- Yes, ma'am.
- So you two will help me, then, right?

23:37.000 --> 23:40.680
Julien, you stay with her. I'll ride solo.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.800
- Ma'am.
- Good.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.120
Hey.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.240
- I got a little problem.
- What's that?

23:52.440 --> 23:55.240
The guy you ID'd today,
he's a C.I. Of mine.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.440
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.560
He's the guy who gave me
the shooters.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.920
He was firing in self-defence.
None of his shots killed anybody.

24:03.600 --> 24:08.360
I was hoping maybe your memory
could get a little fuzzy on this one.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.880
I don't know, Vic.
Aceveda's all over this one.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.720
But if it ever goes to trial?

24:15.520 --> 24:17.120
I don't know.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.040
Let me think about it.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.200
That's all I ask.

24:32.480 --> 24:36.840
- That's Thurman right there.
- I went to high school with him.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.720
- Did you know him?
- He and his friends used to beat me up.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.320
It's okay.
He made me a better student.

24:43.480 --> 24:47.560
I hid out in the library until I grew
9 inches my junior year.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.760
He was killed robbing a liquor store.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.560
Thurman?

24:54.200 --> 24:59.000
He was a thief. He did drugs.
I was afraid to tell you.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.040
I would've helped you anyway.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.160
I mean, maybe he didn't find
his path here on earth...

25:05.320 --> 25:08.800
...but he's with Jesus now.
- You believe that?

25:09.280 --> 25:10.680
I know that.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.560
- Hello?
- You got the money ready?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.680
Yes. Where's my son's body?

25:21.880 --> 25:24.760
- Bring the money to the cemetery at 10.
- What?

25:24.920 --> 25:27.720
<i>Bring the money to the cemetery
at 10:00 sharp.</i>

25:27.880 --> 25:30.600
- I can't understand you.
- Bring the money to the cemetery...

25:30.760 --> 25:33.680
<i>... at 10:00 sharp or Thurman's body
will be chopped to pieces...</i>

25:33.840 --> 25:37.840
...and you'll never see him again.
- Henry! Is that you?

25:38.040 --> 25:39.520
Face front.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.920
- Did you hate her that much?
- No.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.920
She's all right.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.480
We dated for a while, you know?

25:52.640 --> 25:55.120
- Then why did you do it?
- Why did I do it?

25:56.600 --> 25:58.640
Why did I do it?

25:58.800 --> 26:01.840
Knew she had
life insurance on her boy.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.880
I wanted to take my new lady
on one of them cruises.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.240
Dottie spent all the insurance money
on Thurman's funeral.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.600
Can you make it Thursday?

26:14.800 --> 26:16.680
How many problems
can a 5-year-old have?

26:16.840 --> 26:20.880
Enough that he's got an appointment
with a developmental paediatrician.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.280
- Matthew thinks he's a dog now.
- A German shepherd. So what?

26:25.520 --> 26:27.440
You're not here.
You don't see everything.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.560
See what?

26:28.680 --> 26:31.560
The problems.
Why do you have to fight me on this?

26:31.720 --> 26:32.880
I'm not.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.000
Okay, I'll try.
I'll try, okay?

26:40.440 --> 26:41.920
I'm really losing it.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.920
Why don't you go take a bath.
I'll put the kids to bed.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.520
Okay.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.440
Good night. Thanks.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.600
- Get down.
- Hey. I'm a cop.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.960
Get down. Don't scream.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.840
I said, I'm a cop!

27:05.000 --> 27:08.280
And I'm a cop killer.
But not tonight.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.760
Tonight's to show you
how we're gonna do it.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
What do you want?

27:12.120 --> 27:15.720
Forget what you saw at the Chez Club.
Understand?

27:15.880 --> 27:19.520
Yeah. I understand.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.680
Come on.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.200
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You piece of shit!

27:34.360 --> 27:37.520
- Something wrong, officer?
- You think you can get to me?

27:37.680 --> 27:40.920
Girl, you better take some kind of pill.
Damn.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.480
You listen to me. I'm a cop.
You don't scare me.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.280
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.880
You do look scared, though.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.120
Hey.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.600
- I'll catch you outside, okay?
- Meet you out there.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.440
What was all that between you
and my C.I.?

28:13.640 --> 28:16.000
Did you tell him I was the one
that ID'd him?

28:16.200 --> 28:18.560
Of course not.
What the hell is going on?

28:18.760 --> 28:21.520
He sent guys after me.
They put a gun to my head...

28:21.680 --> 28:24.880
...and told me to forget what I saw
at the Chez Club.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.040
- You should take the day off.
- No, maybe I should go after them.

28:28.240 --> 28:32.560
- Let me take care of this.
- Know what, I can take care of myself.

28:42.160 --> 28:46.480
- You went after a cop?
- Vic, I just scared her, man.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.120
Cops are off-limits.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.240
- Shooting at somebody shooting at me.
- I was taking care of it.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.320
I didn't know.
I had to do something, man.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.800
Take your drug money
and bail yourself out.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.240
And then what?

29:05.400 --> 29:09.040
In the year and a half it'll take
to go to trial, I'll make it go away.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.120
Look, I can't take no chances, Vic.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.200
The biggest chance you could've taken
was to piss me off.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.880
And that's exactly what you did.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.160
- You see him?
- No.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.760
But I got you a Spanish-English
phrase book. My gift to you.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.520
Third day in a row you're checking
the Real Estate section.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.480
- What's the deal?
- None your.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.200
What's that, Spanish?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.880
English for "none of your business."

29:43.880 --> 29:47.360
- We're partners. Share.
- Wanna share? Here's the Sports page.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.560
I'll find out. I'm a detective.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.200
There he is.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.600
Bingo, gringo.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.880
Eduardo Salcido?

30:18.160 --> 30:21.280
You and Manuel hopped on the same
truck. You went to work together?

30:23.560 --> 30:26.880
- Did you kill him after work ended?
- No.

30:27.040 --> 30:30.120
- So you killed him on the way to work?
- No.

30:30.280 --> 30:34.640
Where is he? How come his wife
hasn't heard from him?

30:34.800 --> 30:37.240
Spare me the Yo no sÃ©s. We know.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.280
- Know?
- About the grudge.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.240
You hated Manuel.
You told people you wanted to kill him.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.280
He my friend.

30:45.440 --> 30:49.640
- Used to be. Till the trip.
- What happened on that truck?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.320
What truck?

30:51.480 --> 30:54.720
The one that snuck you and Manuel
across the border.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.080
- What made you wanna kill him?
- Nothing.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.000
- You fight? He steal? What?
- Nothing.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.200
He did something.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.720
- Nothing happened.
- Was it personal? Did he hurt you?

31:03.880 --> 31:06.600
I'm not the one who killed Manuel.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.600
So Manuel is dead.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.280
Stay here, Eduardo.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.800
- You ask me, he was raped.
- What?

31:28.960 --> 31:31.600
I know I sound like Dutch
with one of his theories.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.440
But my first few years on the job...

31:34.600 --> 31:38.080
...I practically lived in hospitals,
taking statements from rape victims.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.720
- He's got that look.
- The look?

31:40.920 --> 31:42.640
Nervousness, isolation.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.640
But it's mostly in the eyes.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.080
Raped in a truck sneaking
into the country? How is that possible?

31:49.440 --> 31:51.880
It's possible.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.400
What do you mean,
sounds like one of my theories?

31:58.840 --> 32:00.600
What's with the getups?

32:02.320 --> 32:03.960
Avoiding cameras.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.280
- So, what's the problem?
- This is the goddamn problem.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.760
- He poisoned my baby.
- Threw some meat over the fence...

32:12.880 --> 32:14.920
...next thing, he's choking to death.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.760
- T-Bonz?
- Of course, it's T-Bonz.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.760
- He's got to pay.
- She supposed to be in the studio...

32:19.960 --> 32:23.800
...finishing her album right now.
- How can I work after this? Look.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.280
It's game-over time for T-Bonz.
Be a man.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.120
I know.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.240
You know how much
this setback is costing me?

32:31.440 --> 32:34.240
- Get that off my table.
- The goddamn bastard has to pay.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.000
- That's T-Bonz breaking his truce.
- You gonna be a man...

32:37.160 --> 32:39.520
...or do I have to find someone
to do the job?

32:39.720 --> 32:40.920
Look.

32:41.080 --> 32:44.920
I told you, this is why we here.
I know what I got to do, all right?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.160
All right?

32:47.320 --> 32:50.360
- I just need you to help me do it.
- Do what?

32:50.560 --> 32:52.640
Do the deed.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.760
T-Bonz. I know where he's holed up at.
But I can't get to him.

32:58.120 --> 33:02.360
- A man with a badge could, though.
- Why would I do something like that?

33:02.560 --> 33:06.680
Money. I'll make that rent Rondell
paying you look like chump change.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.920
Pay you double if I get to watch.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.880
You want this war to end, right?

33:22.320 --> 33:26.560
Then help me end it,
or more blood is gonna get spilled.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.160
Give me the address.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.200
- Was Manuel the one who raped you?
- No rape.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.120
- He hold you down?
- It not happen.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.880
- Catch you sleeping, you wake up...
- No.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.200
Somebody did that to me,
I'd smash their head in.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.000
I'd stab them, shoot them,
push him off a roof.

33:44.200 --> 33:48.840
- He raped you in that truck, didn't he?
- We'd understand if you killed him.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.040
I murder Manuel.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.160
You killed Manuel?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.440
I murder Manuel.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.560
Good.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.480
Where?

34:07.600 --> 34:09.760
Working con el SeÃ±or Jamison.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.040
- We were on the roof and he fall.
- You pushed him?

34:13.199 --> 34:16.239
No. He...

34:16.400 --> 34:18.719
We were carrying...

34:19.239 --> 34:21.000
Air conditioning unit.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.880
Look out, Manuel,
but he didn't hear him.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.679
He slipped and he fell.

34:29.840 --> 34:33.159
- He slipped and he fell.
- I murder him.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.679
That's not murder, Eduardo.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.159
That's not what Mr. Jamison say.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.920
What else did SeÃ±or Jamison say?

34:43.719 --> 34:45.480
This is private property!

34:45.639 --> 34:48.400
This is private property.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.840
- It was an accident.
- A man was accidentally buried here?

35:01.840 --> 35:04.200
I asked about Manuel's wife...

35:04.360 --> 35:06.840
...his family, and no one seemed
to know.

35:07.040 --> 35:11.360
- He had no papers, he was illegal.
- Burying a man on your site is illegal.

35:11.800 --> 35:14.720
- I wanted to alert the authorities.
- Too much of a hassle?

35:14.920 --> 35:18.800
It would have shut down business
for weeks, put these guys out of work.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.480
- What would they have done then?
- Please.

35:21.640 --> 35:25.120
You told Eduardo
he was guilty of murder.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.560
This is what you call
planting rice and beans.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.640
Told you not to talk, asshole!

35:37.440 --> 35:39.080
You have the right to remain silent.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.000
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.840
You have the right to have...

35:44.280 --> 35:46.400
This ain't no police station.
What's going on?

35:46.560 --> 35:49.920
Man, please, dog. Whatever you
thinking about doing, don't do it.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.160
T, what happened to that trash talker
I fell in love with?

35:53.360 --> 35:55.440
Come on, man, I'm begging you.
Come on, man.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.080
Come on, you dog killer, let's go.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.600
- Come on, man.
- You broke the truce. Time to pay.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.880
I'll give you money, dude.
I'll hook you up, Mackey. I got money.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.240
I just need one phone call.
I'll give you whatever you need.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.760
- Let's end this, dude. It's over.
- Why you crying, T-Bonz?

36:11.280 --> 36:13.680
- What's he doing here?
- I paid for front row seats.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.080
Mackey, man, please, dog.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.160
Please.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.680
- Come on, Mackey, man.
- Get in.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.480
- You too, Kern.
- What?

36:25.720 --> 36:28.640
- The two of you guys are shacking up.
- Are you crazy?

36:28.840 --> 36:30.880
- He's definitely crazy.
- You two are so keen...

36:31.080 --> 36:34.040
...on killing each other, fine.
I'm cutting out the middle man.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.760
- We had a deal, Vic.
- Hey, I'm never for sale.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.440
Now you know.

36:38.600 --> 36:42.080
- I can respect that, but I'm saying...
- Shut up! Get inside!

36:42.280 --> 36:45.080
You two can't make peace,
I'll see one of you in the morning.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.960
- This how you gonna do it, man?
- Close it.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.880
- I should've thought of this yesterday.
- Yeah.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.560
- Hey, why you got to be such a bitch?
- Because of pricks like you, Freddie.

37:05.720 --> 37:11.040
- I got rights, you goddamn dyke.
- Hey. Save it for your new roommate.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.840
- Yeah, I got a VIN number for you.
- Rondell Robinson just made bail.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.560
- Yeah? Well, that's his right.
- Hundred grand in cash.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.600
- Wow.
- Lot of money for a kid from the ghetto.

37:22.560 --> 37:25.400
Maybe he's got a rich uncle.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.880
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.640
- You just been a little jacked-up today.
- Well, I'm fine.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.920
If you don't wanna talk about it,
that's cool.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.440
But I'm gonna say a prayer
for you tonight, though.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.440
Thanks.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.400
Heard you made bail.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.760
Hey. Your peaches are about
to go bad in there.

37:51.600 --> 37:55.000
Where's my stuff?
Where's my TV, man?

37:55.160 --> 37:57.720
Donated to the Lynwild Boys' Club.

37:57.880 --> 38:01.920
You should've seen the looks on these
kids' faces. Man, it was like Christmas.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.360
My goddamn records, man?!

38:07.880 --> 38:11.120
You went after a cop, Rondell.

38:13.600 --> 38:17.320
You should thank me, dude. I talked
him out of doing a hell of a lot worse.

38:21.480 --> 38:26.280
The district attorney is content
that Manuel's death was accidental.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.120
I see.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.560
This Mr. Jamison,
what is his punishment?

38:30.720 --> 38:34.600
He'll plead guilty to tampering with
evidence, be fined and released.

38:34.760 --> 38:38.080
SeÃ±ora Ruiz, I am truly sorry
about your husband.

38:41.840 --> 38:45.320
This man, Jamison, worked for
a large company, no?

38:46.080 --> 38:47.280
Yes.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.560
Then I can sue them for much money?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.600
Thanks again, David.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.840
I'm glad I could help.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.840
I have given some thought
to your proposal.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.600
- And?
- I'm intrigued.

39:06.240 --> 39:10.160
I have a few months before I decide
who I'm going to back.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.000
Show me what you can do.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.880
- They no think I murder Manuel?
- No.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.360
Muchas gracias, Detective Dutch.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.360
Tell me something. You hated Manuel.

39:25.520 --> 39:29.360
You made threats against his life. Why
go on the same job with him that day?

39:29.960 --> 39:33.040
When the truck come,
they pick Manuel, they pick me.

39:34.320 --> 39:35.720
I have to work.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.400
So, what's next, Eduardo?

39:40.720 --> 39:43.080
I don't know.

39:43.240 --> 39:47.520
The reason I ask is, I've got
this retaining wall that's crumbling...

39:53.440 --> 39:55.720
Looking for me?

39:55.880 --> 39:57.840
Heard you were
kicking some ass today.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.720
No more than usual.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.960
Do you trust me?

40:06.560 --> 40:10.280
- What?
- With your life. Do you trust me?

40:13.520 --> 40:14.520
Yeah.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.480
Well, then you believe me
when I tell you...

40:17.640 --> 40:20.160
...you don't have to look over your
shoulder no more.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.600
I took care of it.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.560
- You took care of it?
- You got no more problems.

40:32.280 --> 40:35.000
Christ. I don't know what...

40:38.480 --> 40:40.600
Hello?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.000
What?

40:43.160 --> 40:45.360
Where?

40:45.520 --> 40:47.800
All right, I'll be right there.
I gotta run.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.720
<i>Doctor Shapiro to Cardiology.
Doctor Shapiro to Cardiology.</i>

41:01.880 --> 41:05.840
Nurse. Hi. I'm look...
I got it.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.080
Okay. Where's Megan?

41:08.240 --> 41:10.200
She's getting x-rays.
Mom's with her.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.440
He didn't mean it.

41:11.600 --> 41:15.400
A 5-year-old does not bite his
18-month-old sister on the face...

41:15.560 --> 41:17.480
...and make her fall on her head.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.640
All right, go be with Megan.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.000
Hey.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.440
It's gonna be okay.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.640
Your sister's gonna be all right.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.920
I don't hear nothing.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.520
Assholes like these don't
wake up before noon.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.840
T-Bonz!

42:05.040 --> 42:07.840
Nobody else coming out of there.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.920
Told you he was a bitch.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.360
I'll have my cleanup crew
come clean that mess, man.

42:18.840 --> 42:19.840
Oh, shit.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.520
- Give me that.
- Fine.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.280
I'll take care of this.

42:47.280 --> 42:49.720
You hungry?

42:50.160 --> 42:52.920
Goddamn starved.
