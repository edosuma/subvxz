I can't give you the gang.

But I can give you
the name of the broker

04:55.033 --> 04:58.210
we were gonna sell
the weapons to.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.735

Go ahead, Miguel. Why don't you
tell me that again?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.050
We didn't have a deal.

05:12.094 --> 05:13.748
Juan knew there was a broker
who put out the word.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.750
He was looking
for fully automatic weapons.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.230
And this is Juan?Yeah.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.841
We knew there were
modified AR-15s

05:19.884 --> 05:21.712
here in the U.S.
we could get cheap.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.019
Just didn't know they were being
sold by an undercover fed

05:24.062 --> 05:25.890
until we found out
we had a snitch.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.501
Well, that snitch was our C.I.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.893
You cut his guts out.

You talk to the cops,
that's what happens.Hmm.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.245
So, where is this broker?I told you.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.638
I don't know anything about him.

05:34.682 --> 05:36.074
Juan was handling that.

from the case you were
working on with ATF?

05:47.477 --> 05:49.740
That was his name, right?
The one that got away?

06:03.754 --> 06:05.756
That's his name.

Explain to me how you
were gonna make a deal

06:42.706 --> 06:45.143

about Spencer Williams.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.189
Juan had made
the contact with Williams.

I didn't know anything about it.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.282

deal gonna take place?

06:53.325 --> 06:55.240
We had no deal.

I think Juan had only
spoke to Williams once.

Juan is dead.

That doesn't help me,

I gave you a name.

Wow, okay.

Of course he did.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.413
That is great news.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.240
It wasn't good.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.284
Could have been any of us.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.375
MOSLEY:
He's not giving anything up.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.813
I spoke to ATF. I'm gonna
send him over there

07:45.856 --> 07:47.597
and see if they can get
anything else out of him.

07:47.641 --> 07:48.772
KENSI: Okay, we'll
drive him there now.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.034
Yeah, we can do it.
We got time.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.558
I'm taking him to ATF.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.778
I'll go with you.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.214
I'm gonna go alone.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.435
That was a major
shooting incident.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.350
I'm sure you have lots

MOSLEY:
Get up.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.794
Let's go.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.364
I'm gonna need you two
to follow her.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.018
You want us to
follow our boss?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.979
Sorry, I'm just looking
for some clarity here.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.285
You have to give us
something more.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.243
No, I don't.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.984
Sometimes it's about
just doing it.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.914
This look like
ATF's offices to you?

08:43.958 --> 08:44.959
Not so much.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.533
Get up. Move.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.546
Callen, we're here
at Bell Gardens on Garfield.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.330
So, what's there?DEEKS:
Looks like absolutely nothing.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.940
Any evidence of ATF in the area?

09:09.984 --> 09:12.813
No. She took Miguel Reyes
to what looks like

09:12.856 --> 09:15.424
a nondescript
industrial building.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.468
What do you
want us to do?

09:16.512 --> 09:17.861
If she's not out in 15 minutes,

09:17.905 --> 09:19.602
I want you to go in.Are you kidding me?!

09:19.646 --> 09:21.604
Mosley's gonna kill us if she
found out we followed her.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.606
It was my call.
You were just following orders.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.782
Callen, what are we
walking into?

09:25.826 --> 09:28.698
I don't know.
That's why you're going in.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.526
Ending our careers now.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.267
I'll see you all
on LinkedIn.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.724
KENSI: Whoa.
It's us, it's us!Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.117
Don't shoot us.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.379
What the hell are you
doing here?

09:57.422 --> 10:00.730
Um, well,
I gotta be honest,

10:00.774 --> 10:03.603
I am not exactly sure.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.082
Wow.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.171
Well, I think the question is:
what are you doing here?

10:07.215 --> 10:10.174
I wanted to talk to him
a little bit more

10:10.218 --> 10:11.654
before ATF got him.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.136
He ran, we fought.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.833
You fought?Mm-hmm.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.182
Seems a little one-sided.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.054
And then I restrained him.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.058
And then you
restrained him.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.062
This is a nice place
you got here, huh?

10:28.105 --> 10:32.544
Is this your, uh,
home away from home?

10:32.588 --> 10:34.634
Something like that.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.859
Did you follow me?

10:42.903 --> 10:44.078
Callen's orders.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.515
Did you find anything else?

10:46.558 --> 10:47.864
A phone number.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.823
Williams?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.912
I don't know, we'll see.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.696
DEEKS:
So,

10:53.740 --> 10:56.003
do you want me to note
the prisoner's condition

10:56.046 --> 10:58.048
in my report?

10:58.092 --> 11:00.007
Of course.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.661
Minor scrapes.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.227
Minorscrapes.

11:03.271 --> 11:06.230
Yeah, minor scrapes due
to his re-apprehension.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.884
KENSI:
While under the custody

11:07.928 --> 11:09.320
of EAD Mosley.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.715
But now he's in your custody,

11:12.759 --> 11:14.543
so you can take him back
to the boatshed

11:14.586 --> 11:17.851
while I do a little research
on this phone number.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.130
Start with European carriers.
Sat phones, burn phones...

11:36.173 --> 11:39.046
Faxes, landlines, okay.Yes. Exactly.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.657
Williams has made arms deals
all over the world.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.398
Governments, insurgents,

11:43.441 --> 11:44.442
terrorists.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.357
Check Syria, Indonesia,

11:46.401 --> 11:47.837
Myanmar, Congo.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.491
Also see if there are
any matches with...

11:49.534 --> 11:51.536
Unlisted military
and intelligence numbers.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.886
Got it.
Correct.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.628
If you ever have agents
follow me again,

11:56.672 --> 11:59.457
I will have you arrested
for interfering and impeding

11:59.501 --> 12:01.198
a federal investigation.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.635
You gonna do that
from prison?

12:03.679 --> 12:05.768
Kensi told me what you did
to Miguel Reyes.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.727
We're not having this
conversation, Agent Callen.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.338
And I would have to ask that you
leave this operation center.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.079
Look, I understand
why you're doing this.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.689
Then you understand why
I don't have the time

12:13.733 --> 12:15.038
to have this discussion.

12:16.474 --> 12:19.303
So please leave.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.610
Now.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.443
HETTY:
Mr. Callen.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.403
You heard?

12:32.447 --> 12:34.797
Yes.This is not just
about Mosley anymore.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.017
Okay, she will bring down
this entire office with her.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.803
Well, she's in a very,
very difficult situation.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.500
Yeah, I get it.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.111
But she beat a prisoner
to extract information,

12:44.154 --> 12:46.156
then she dumped him
into our chain of custody,

12:46.200 --> 12:48.158
making all of us complicit.Yes.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.900
And I'd do the same thing
if it was my child.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.641
And so would either of you.

12:52.684 --> 12:53.947
What are you doing here?

12:53.990 --> 12:55.339
It's good to see
you, too, partner.

12:55.383 --> 12:58.386
You should be in the
hospital, Agent Hanna.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.691
I mean, you shouldn't
be standing,

12:59.735 --> 13:01.258
let alone climbing stairs.I'm good.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.218
She's fighting for her child.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.568
And I promise to help her, okay,
but she is out of control.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.092
Look at what you were ready
to do for your father, G.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.529
Yeah, but we always have
each other's backs.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.923
Well, EAD Mosley has
had our backs, too.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.273
But she doesn't now.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.448
We'll watch her.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.886
And I'll remind her

13:19.929 --> 13:21.278
that we're watching.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.803
That is not gonna make
a damn bit of difference.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.282
She would drag us to hell

13:25.326 --> 13:26.718
if she thought she
could find her son.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.461
ERIC: There are a lot of numbers
in the world

13:30.505 --> 13:32.724
that match the one
you got from Reyes--

13:32.768 --> 13:35.162
different country codes,
different prefixes.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.468
But this one right here is
associated with a cell phone

13:37.512 --> 13:39.644
located inside the second home

13:39.688 --> 13:41.821
of General Arturo Vásquez.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.824
It's in Sinaloa, right outside
of Los Mochis, Mexico.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.957
Okay, I just got a hit
from the CIA on General Vásquez.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.393
They do have a file on him.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.960
MOSLEY:
Take a look.
See what you can find.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.310
I flagged this number because
General Vásquez is in charge

13:53.354 --> 13:55.660
of armament acquisitions
for the Mexican army.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.271
Vásquez buys weapons.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.402
And Williams sells them.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.534
NELL:
Boom.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.623
CIA surveillance footage
from 2015:

14:01.666 --> 14:03.973
Williams with Vásquez.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.410
ERIC: Vásquez's home is
the last location of the phone.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.151
It was used three hours ago,
then shut off.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.587
Tap the phone.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.980
Sure. We'll submit
for the warrant.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.373
No warrant.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.984
Assistant Director,

14:15.028 --> 14:17.769
without a warrant, we won't be
able to make a case against...

14:17.813 --> 14:20.772
Ms. Jones, I know how
federal prosecution works,

14:20.816 --> 14:22.687
so just tap the damn phone.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.254
There will be
a chain of evidence

14:24.298 --> 14:26.169
showing that I was the one
who hacked...

14:26.213 --> 14:27.475
Mr. Beale, let me be clear.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.781
If you don't tap the
phone, you're fired.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.266
MOSLEY:
Yes.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.965
HETTY: I'd like to have a word
with you if you have a moment.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.880
And I with you.
I'm coming down now.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.229
There's no need for that.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.666
I'm in your office.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.805
Please don't sit
in my chair anymore.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.807
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.809
This is just such
a wonderful view

14:57.853 --> 15:01.204
of this entire office.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.773
All these brilliant people
working together.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.471
It's such a powerful machine.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.734
Are you gonna get up?No.

15:09.778 --> 15:13.738
I think it's important to
hold on to this view of things.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.088
Hetty, I am trying
to find my son,

15:15.131 --> 15:16.437
and I don't have time for games.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.960
I need you to call
the State Department

15:18.004 --> 15:20.223
and get them to convince
the Mexican Federal Police

15:20.267 --> 15:22.660
to raid the home of a
General Arturo Vásquez.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.967
I think to proceed recklessly

15:25.011 --> 15:27.361
might compromise
everything.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.972
It could cost you your career.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.365
I don't give a damn
about my career.

15:31.408 --> 15:32.801
This is about my son.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.759
Without him, I have nothing.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.589
I need you to call
the State Department.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.678
You don't have your son,

15:40.722 --> 15:44.378
but you do have the tools
to get him back--

15:44.421 --> 15:46.858
this powerful office.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.252
If you were to lose that,

15:49.296 --> 15:51.907
then you will have nothing.

15:55.302 --> 15:58.000
You can have your desk back.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.308
Enjoy the view.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.881
You should get him cleaned up.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.535
KENSI :
That is him cleaned up.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.494
Also, he's had ice
on his face

16:13.537 --> 16:14.843
for an hour.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.677
CALLEN:
Okay...

16:22.720 --> 16:25.201
no photos, no lawyers.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.160
Hold him a couple days if we
can, give him some time to heal.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.292
Fellas, this is that
"come to Jesus" moment

16:29.336 --> 16:30.946
where you need to tell us
what's going on.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.513
This is on a need-to-know basis.

16:32.556 --> 16:33.949
My partner and I
have become party

16:33.993 --> 16:35.255
to assaulting a prisoner.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.647
I think I would classify
that as "need to know."

16:36.691 --> 16:38.432
KENSI:
Deeks.
What?

16:38.475 --> 16:39.433
If you guys need us
to trust you,

16:39.476 --> 16:40.608
then we will do that.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.305
What about them trusting us?SAM: G...

16:42.349 --> 16:43.437
tell 'em.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.965
Sam, you're bleeding.I'll change it later.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.967
The bandage is leaking.KENSI: Sam, you should
not be on your feet.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.273
Please sit down.I'm fine.

16:53.316 --> 16:54.448
Tell them.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.060
Mosley and Spencer Williams

16:58.104 --> 17:02.064
had a relationship
before he was a fugitive.

17:02.108 --> 17:05.459
She has a child...

17:05.502 --> 17:07.026
What?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.244
...with Williams.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.899
Five years ago,
when he fled the country,

17:10.942 --> 17:12.292
he took the boy.KENSI:
Oh, my God.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.336
His name is Derrick.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.904
She hasn't seen
her son since then.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.384
He'd be about ten years old now.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.344
Agent Callen.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.825
You and I had
a private conversation.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.740
And I expected you
to keep it that way.

17:25.783 --> 17:29.483
Hetty told me that
I could trust you.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.354
All of you.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.009
But apparently,
that isn't the case.I mean, as far as I can see,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.706
he's just trying to explain
why you did what you did.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.578
He's trying to help
us understand you.
Yeah, maybe

17:37.621 --> 17:38.796
if you would've
asked for help

17:38.840 --> 17:40.189
instead of just throwing
us under a bus...

17:40.233 --> 17:42.148
Deeks!What's she gonna do?
Is she gonna fire us?

17:42.191 --> 17:43.975
She beat a restrained
prisoner,

17:44.019 --> 17:45.716
and then she made us
a part of it.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.414
Excuse me?Oh, what, you
didn't know that?

17:47.457 --> 17:49.807
Look behind you.
Look at his face.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.114
She did that to expedite
an interrogation.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.811
You know what, I didn't
even need you to trust us,

17:53.855 --> 17:54.812
but it sure as hell
would've been nice

17:54.856 --> 17:55.857
if you stopped threatening us.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.032
Detective Deeks,
this is between me

17:57.076 --> 17:58.468
and Agent Callen.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.904
Apparently, it's between
all of us now.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.819
I asked him to keep this
in confidence,

18:01.863 --> 18:04.213
and he didn't do that.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.693
This is about his character.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.738
DEEKS:
Oh, my God, you've
got to be kidding me.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.827
See, that's the difference
right there, isn't it?

18:09.871 --> 18:11.655
He's trying to help you,
and what do you do?

18:11.699 --> 18:12.787
You question
his integrity.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.528
You've questioned
all of our integrity

18:14.571 --> 18:15.790
since you got here, and
what has it gotten you?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.096
It hasn't made us
a better team.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.314
It sure as hell hasn't
made us more loyal.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.446
So what is it?
Is it the power?I am sorry,

18:19.489 --> 18:20.838
Detective Deeks,
but I don't have time

18:20.882 --> 18:22.013
for this conversation.You just need that power?

18:22.057 --> 18:22.840
You just desperately need
that power?

18:22.884 --> 18:24.929
You are fired,
Detective Deeks.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.409
Go back to LAPD.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.019
You're done at NCIS.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.065
You sure about that?Oh, I'm positive.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.414
You want to fire
the person that can

18:31.458 --> 18:33.024
testify against you for what
you did to Miguel Reyes?

18:33.068 --> 18:35.940
You better get out of my face.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.942
You know what, this has gone
far enough, you two. Enough.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.771
You leave this boatshed,
you go gather your things,

18:40.815 --> 18:42.164
and you get the hell
out of here.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.601
And I can promise you
this is not a threat.

18:45.646 --> 18:46.734
Now.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.172
Okay.

18:59.268 --> 19:02.489
EAD Mosley, the phone was
turned on seven minutes ago.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.012
It's still inside the compound.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.362
Was there a conversation?

19:06.406 --> 19:08.669
Yeah.Play it.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.192
WILLIAMS :
3.2 per crate.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
35 pieces per crate.
50 crates.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.587
MAN: Sí, claro,
it's what we agreed to.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.806
WILLIAMS: I repeat details.
I like to be clear.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.547
MAN: Is the merchandise
in country now?

19:17.591 --> 19:18.809
WILLIAMS:
That's not your concern.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.811
Let me call you back.
15 minutes.

19:20.855 --> 19:25.164
That is definitely the voice
of Spencer Williams.

19:29.037 --> 19:32.171
The man who took my son.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.749
WILLIAMS :
Only bring three men.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.011
You can check the crates,

19:47.055 --> 19:48.448
then I'll give you the keys
to the truck.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.493
MAN: Sounds good. The money
will be in U.S. dollars.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.495
WILLIAMS: Circulated cash only.MAN: When?

19:52.539 --> 19:53.975
WILLIAMS:
Thursday, 11:00 a.m.

19:54.018 --> 19:56.325
I'll call and give you
the location an hour before.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.936
The deal's gonna go down
in roughly 36 hours.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.156
We also have a conversation
talking about how his plane

20:01.200 --> 20:02.331
will be ready
Thursday afternoon.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.899
That's our window.
Send the recordings

20:04.942 --> 20:07.249
down to the FBI in Sinaloa
and see if they can help us...

20:07.293 --> 20:09.077
I'm sorry, we can't do that.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.992
NELL:
The taps were illegal.

20:11.035 --> 20:14.213
To move forward with the FBI
or the Mexican authorities,

20:14.256 --> 20:16.432
the source of the recordings
would have to come out.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.521
I said send the recordings
to the FBI.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.175
And that is an order.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.309
Can I speak
with you outside?

20:26.747 --> 20:29.489
Any arrests, any information
gained from those recordings

20:29.532 --> 20:30.751
is legally useless.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.753
It's fruit of a poison tree,
Agent Callen.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.276
I have a degree
in criminal justice.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.625
Do not insult me.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.627
This case does not fall
under NCIS's purview,

20:37.671 --> 20:38.889
so you don't even
have the authority

20:38.933 --> 20:40.891
to request those warrants.I don't care.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.763
Or is that not
abundantly clear to you?

20:42.806 --> 20:43.851
That is very clear to me.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.722
If I can't rely
on your help in this,

20:45.766 --> 20:47.246
then you can go home.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.899
Look, I said that I would
help you get your son back,

20:48.943 --> 20:51.293
but you're going
all-in on Williams

20:51.337 --> 20:52.903
without even knowing
where your son is.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.254
Williams is the key
to finding my son.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.907
Yes, but you're making
it all or nothing.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.909
In two days there could be
a federal prosecutor

20:58.953 --> 21:00.563
bringing an indictment
against you.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.957
We need to do this
the right way. And then,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.698
if we locate Derrick,
I stand by my word,

21:04.741 --> 21:07.309
I will do whatever it takes
to get him back.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.963
Uh, Hetty needs to see

21:09.006 --> 21:10.486
the executive assistant director
in her office.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.184
She's on with the FBI
in Sinaloa.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.280
Here she comes.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.585
Agent Gonzalez,

21:22.629 --> 21:25.458
this is Executive
Assistant Director Mosley.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.329
EAD Mosley.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.722
This is a personal favor.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.289
Everything I say
is off the record.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.160
Understood.You're gonna have
a very difficult time

21:32.203 --> 21:33.422
getting
the Mexican Federal Police

21:33.466 --> 21:35.119
to go
into General Vásquez's home.

21:35.163 --> 21:37.296
In Sinaloa, the Federalesare
in bed with the cartels

21:37.339 --> 21:38.514
and the military.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.733
All right,
Sinaloa is not Mexico.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.082
It's a different beast.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.736
Even if they said
they were going in,

21:42.779 --> 21:44.433
they will drag their feet
and give warning...

21:44.477 --> 21:46.566
So Williams and his men
would have time to get out.

21:46.609 --> 21:49.177
Yes. So you can't come at this
on the ground.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.180
Word gets out to the cartels,
the Federales,or the military,

21:52.223 --> 21:54.008
Williams becomes a ghost.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.096
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.968
Hetty. EAD Mosley.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.361
Thank you.

21:59.405 --> 22:00.928
Not good news,
I'm afraid.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.887
Will you continue to pursue this
higher up the food chain?

22:03.931 --> 22:06.455
DoD, State Department?Of course.

22:06.499 --> 22:09.110
I'd like to feel free
to tell the whole story.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.590
There's no shame in it.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.592
It doesn't feel that way, Hetty.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.290
But I guess, at this point,
it doesn't really matter.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.161
So go ahead.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.293
Tell 'em.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.468
Whatever it takes.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.948
Good. That'll help.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.515
Please don't give up, Hetty.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.473
Oh, I won't
give up.

22:24.517 --> 22:27.302
But you need to slow down.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.000
I won't stand by
while you coerce

22:30.044 --> 22:33.482
Agent Callen into doing
something dangerous and stupid.

22:33.526 --> 22:34.875
He promised me.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.617
A few words, months ago.He's a grown-up,

22:37.660 --> 22:39.445
and he can decide for himself.

22:39.488 --> 22:42.448
The only reason he's
doing what he's doing now

22:42.491 --> 22:44.188
is to keep the others
from getting involved.

22:44.232 --> 22:47.888
I understand that you are trying
to protect your agents.

22:47.931 --> 22:50.151
But you have
to understand this, Hetty:

22:50.194 --> 22:53.415
I am fighting for my son's life.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.025
And there is a difference.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.375
Then you
understand this,

22:56.418 --> 22:58.202
Shay:

22:58.246 --> 23:02.250
Agent Callen
is as close to a son

23:02.293 --> 23:05.427
as I've ever had.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.652
You want to tell me why
you're not in the hospital?

23:16.482 --> 23:17.744
I'm okay.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.398
How bad could it be,
right? Bullet wound

23:19.441 --> 23:20.529
nicks one
of your major arteries?

23:20.573 --> 23:22.662
And how do you know that?

23:22.705 --> 23:25.055
Well, if you hadn't noticed, I
have some investigative skills.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.361
What

23:26.405 --> 23:29.320
That's a map of the area,
latest sat photos

23:29.364 --> 23:30.496
of the compound
where Williams is.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.062
There's lots of men--
military, mostly--

23:32.106 --> 23:33.237
but it's not
really being

23:33.281 --> 23:35.239
strategically secured.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.981
That's General Vásquez's
home base.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.896
He's being protected
by the Mexican military,

23:39.940 --> 23:42.029
the cartels, federal police.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.248
Meaning?Meaning it's bad numbers
for us.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.250
But they think they're secure.
That makes them vulnerable.

23:46.294 --> 23:48.078
We could get to Williams.And do what?

23:48.122 --> 23:50.864
We can't extradite him, not
unless we falsify the reports

23:50.907 --> 23:53.040
and say that he was taken
in the U.S.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.911
We can do that.All right, look.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.478
I agreed to help Mosley, okay?

23:56.522 --> 23:57.784
That doesn't mean you have to.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.394
It's her son.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.397
I'm kind of not down with losing
family members these days.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.007
I'm sure you can understand.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.662
This isn't about her son, okay?

24:06.706 --> 24:08.490
This is about Williams.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.753
And arresting him is one big
step in getting the child back.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.276
Maybe, maybe not.
We don't know where the kid is.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.539
Look, i-it doesn't matter.

24:13.582 --> 24:14.627
Okay? You're wounded.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.324
You can barely walk,
let alone run.

24:16.367 --> 24:19.675
I've been in worse battles
with more serious wounds.

24:19.719 --> 24:20.763
I can do my job.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.504
This isn't your job, okay?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.593
This is an off-the-books
mission.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.812
Well, then, I guess
you really have no say

24:25.855 --> 24:27.466
in whether or not
I'm going on this.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.684
In fact, I could
call it my mission

24:28.728 --> 24:30.381
and tell younot to go.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.209
This isn't a joke.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.994
Do I look like I'm laughing?

24:34.037 --> 24:36.605
Now, you want
to go over this,

24:36.649 --> 24:38.781
so at least you know
what you're talking about?

24:42.176 --> 24:43.525
You need to come up
to Ops quickly.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.700
What is it?

24:44.744 --> 24:46.833
Just come up here
before Mosley does.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.880
Try to keep up.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.020
What is it?

25:00.063 --> 25:02.979
Eric, can you give us
the room, please?

25:04.285 --> 25:06.548
CALLEN: This recording
was done 30 minutes ago.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.116
Eric worked on the audio to
make it more intelligible.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.988
Listen to the background voices.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.120
MAN 2 :
It's a G550.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.164
WILLIAMS:
Needs to be fully fueled.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.644
MAN 2:
Yes. Destination?

25:15.688 --> 25:16.602
WILLIAMS: Destination will be
determined in flight.

25:16.645 --> 25:17.820
DERRICK:
Where's the sandwich?

25:17.864 --> 25:19.213
Juana said it was on the table.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.823
WOMAN:
It's in the refrigerator.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.695
DERRICK:
I looked, it's not there.WILLIAMS: Get him out.

25:22.738 --> 25:23.826
WOMAN:
Come out, Papa's working.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.612
I know it's been five years,

25:26.655 --> 25:27.787
but do you know
if that's Derrick?

25:27.830 --> 25:30.311
That's the voice of my son.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.834
I didn't think he was alive.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.575
SAM:
Well, he is alive.

25:33.619 --> 25:37.361
And he's inside that compound.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.320
I need the room, please.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.959
Send me all current
satellite images

26:10.003 --> 26:12.266
of the compound,
and keep me posted.

26:12.309 --> 26:13.833
Got it.
What are you doing?

26:13.876 --> 26:16.749
Going to get my son.And do you have a plan?

26:16.792 --> 26:19.273
I'm headed down to Sinaloa.
I'm putting together a team,

26:19.316 --> 26:20.579
and I'm bringing him home.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.059
Detective, you are taking
too long to pack.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.408
If I see you in
this building again,

26:24.452 --> 26:26.193
you will be escorted out.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.629
CALLEN:
Hold on.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.239
Wait a second.
You have no idea

26:29.283 --> 26:30.458
what you're walking into.

26:30.501 --> 26:31.590
Even the satellite images
will be days old

26:31.633 --> 26:32.982
by the time you
get down there.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.767
I'm sorry, Agent Callen,
aren't you coming with me?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.682
Isn't that what you said,
that if we found my son,

26:36.725 --> 26:38.205
that you would do
whatever it takes?

26:38.248 --> 26:40.076
So are you gonna help me,
yes or no?

26:40.120 --> 26:41.687
Yes.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.906
We both will.No. He is injured, okay?

26:43.950 --> 26:45.473
He is not going
on a tactical mission.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.780
Don't speak for me, G.
We've been through this already.

26:47.823 --> 26:50.521
Figure it out, gentlemen.
I don't have time.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.394
SAM: Hey, I'm
going to Mexico.

26:53.437 --> 26:55.439
Just hold on a sec.

26:55.483 --> 26:56.963
I'm going. So either we
can stand here fighting,

26:57.006 --> 26:58.921
or we start
to figure this thing out.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.357
You are a liability.

27:00.401 --> 27:01.663
I'm a liability?Yes, you are.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.969
Ha. I don't know
whether you're trying

27:03.012 --> 27:04.274
to protect me or make me laugh.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.885
If this was reversed,
you would knock me out

27:05.928 --> 27:07.626
before you'd let me
go down there with a cane.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.628
Yeah, well, I can
leave the cane here.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.846
All right?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.239
I'm going to get that child.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.893
Her child is not
in imminent danger.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.285
We're parachuting
into a custody battle.

27:15.329 --> 27:18.114
Let me talk to her first.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.116
How about I see you
on the plane?

27:23.250 --> 27:24.730
Good talk.

27:29.038 --> 27:31.258
I don't think you
should go to Mexico.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.912
Hear me out.

27:32.955 --> 27:36.611
You are better utilized here,
dealing with State, DoD, FBI.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.047
The distraught mother
of a kidnapped child

27:38.091 --> 27:39.614
is a lot more useful here

27:39.658 --> 27:41.703
than on the ground
in Mexico with a gun.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.487
Who's gonna get my son?

27:43.531 --> 27:45.576
I am.By yourself?

27:45.620 --> 27:47.622
I have contacts I can call.What about Sam?

27:47.666 --> 27:48.710
Sam is wounded.
It would be dangerous

27:48.754 --> 27:49.711
for him to participate in this.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.278
Sam can do this. I trust him.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.714
I'm not gonna get
either one of us killed

27:52.758 --> 27:54.150
when there are others
that can do the job.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.238
What about Kensi?

27:55.282 --> 27:57.893
No. No one from NCIS.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.895
Give me time
to put a team together.

27:59.939 --> 28:02.942
Callen, we have less than
48 hours to do this.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.160
Arrange the flight
to Los Mochis.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.640
I'll do what I have to do
on the plane.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.730
You and Hetty stay here
and work your side.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.646
You just got to
trust me on this.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.128
SAM:
We got a break.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.958
Oh, look who found his cane.I'm here, Eric. Go.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.742
In one of the conversations,

28:20.786 --> 28:23.919
we heard Williams talking
about an Agustin Garcia.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.313
Kind of an unusual name,
so I did some cross-checking,

28:26.356 --> 28:27.967
and I found an Agustin Garcia,

28:28.010 --> 28:29.969
served in the same Marine unit
as Williams.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.492
He lives here
in North Hollywood.

28:31.535 --> 28:32.667
Do we know it's the same person?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.190
This Agustin Garcia traveled

28:34.234 --> 28:37.672
to Los Mochis seven times
in the last four months.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.456
If he works for Williams,
he could tell us

28:39.500 --> 28:41.415
a hell of a lot about
what's inside that compound.

28:41.458 --> 28:42.633
I was able to hack
into his phone.

28:42.677 --> 28:45.071
He set an alarm for 8:30 a.m.,

28:45.114 --> 28:46.594
so Garcia's most likely
asleep now.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.814
Let's wake his ass up,
and do it fast.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.775
I mean, the truth is, even if
we know how many men are inside,

28:53.819 --> 28:56.082
it's still gonna be a nightmare
to get close undetected.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.171
This is, this is just
a wide-open desert.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.260
Deeks, you should leave.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.653
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to save her son.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.612
I know, but she's serious.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.266
Okay, so am I.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.137
So go home,
let her calm down.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.357
All right? I-If we
end up going to Mexico,

29:10.400 --> 29:12.228
I will call you,
I promise.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.884
I don't know,
maybe getting fired

29:15.928 --> 29:18.713
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.802
You know? I mean,
we keep talking about

29:20.846 --> 29:22.369
trying to find
a time to get out.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.980
Yeah, I know.
But I like working with you.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.721
It's part of who we are.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.853
Yes.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.420
It is a partof who we are.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.727
A part that I
happen to love.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.555
Come on, Kensi,
you heard Callen.

29:34.598 --> 29:35.861
He's not wrong.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.645
This kid is
flying around

29:37.688 --> 29:40.082
in Learjets with nannies;
this is a custody case.

29:40.126 --> 29:43.216
He was kidnapped by his dad,
a violent felon

29:43.259 --> 29:45.044
who ordered the murder
of a federal agent.

29:45.087 --> 29:48.047
Let's not forget that.Sam almost died today.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.486
And anything can
happen down there.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.096
Okay, so what are you saying,
that we shouldn't go?

29:54.140 --> 29:55.663
No, I'm just saying
we're about to be married.

29:55.706 --> 29:58.144
I think we can have
this conversation, don't you?

29:58.187 --> 30:00.755
I mean, the truth is,
this kid could stay down there,

30:00.799 --> 30:02.801
and he could go to
private schools and college

30:02.844 --> 30:04.498
and have an amazing life,

30:04.541 --> 30:05.891
or my soon-to-be wife
could be killed

30:05.934 --> 30:08.067
while trying to get him
on a helicopter, and for what?

30:08.110 --> 30:10.112
For a woman who I'm pretty sure
doesn't even like us.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.767
Why? I had absolutely no idea,
because everybody loves us,

30:12.811 --> 30:14.900
because we're kind
and we're-we're generous...

30:14.943 --> 30:16.118
Because we're happy.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.555
Because we're
living our lives,

30:18.599 --> 30:20.906
because we have joy,
because we have a future.

30:20.949 --> 30:24.605
That woman has nothing
but anger and pain.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.128
Can you imagine...

30:28.914 --> 30:30.916
If you've come
to apologize, I accept.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.918
That's the last thing
I would do, Deeks.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.658
Fair enough, okay.
I'll do it. I'm sorry.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.836
I'm sorry because you are
in an extraordinary situation

30:37.879 --> 30:40.055
that I cannot begin to imagine.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.927
And I wouldn't...

30:44.364 --> 30:45.408
'Sup, fellas?

30:45.452 --> 30:47.410
How's it going, Deeks?

30:47.454 --> 30:50.457
Confiscate his security badge
and escort him to his car.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.545
LAPD will be

30:51.588 --> 30:53.112
waiting for you outside

30:53.155 --> 30:55.636
the parking structure
to accompany you home.

30:58.030 --> 31:00.380
Yep.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.821
Really?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.171
I don't have a choice
right now, Kensi.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.132
I know this is your son.

31:13.175 --> 31:16.222
And maybe, just one day,
I will understand...

31:16.265 --> 31:18.180
I pray to God you never do.

31:19.921 --> 31:22.141
Ever.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.012
:
Okay.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.670
KENSI:
Deeks!

46:37.316 --> 46:39.144
It's not responding.

46:39.187 --> 46:40.536
What about
her secondary tracker?

46:42.321 --> 46:43.583
Nothing.

46:43.626 --> 46:45.150
And when did you have her last?

46:45.193 --> 46:47.717
22:34.
A few miles northeast of you.

46:47.761 --> 46:48.980
I'll send you the coordinates.

46:49.023 --> 46:51.330
We got a location for

46:51.373 --> 46:52.897
Hidoko's personal tracker
before it went off-line.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.376
Where?

46:54.420 --> 46:57.510
A few miles from here.
Sam and I will check it out.

46:57.553 --> 47:00.556
You guys check out the room.Copy that.

47:06.867 --> 47:09.522
When were you gonna tell me

47:09.565 --> 47:11.741
that Deeks was in Mexico
with the others?

47:11.785 --> 47:14.396
He is?
Yes.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.617
He's such a rascal.

47:17.660 --> 47:19.097
Well, that's one name for him.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.143
You seem awfully calm, Hetty.

47:22.187 --> 47:23.362
Do I?

47:23.405 --> 47:25.146
Yes.
Hmm.

47:25.190 --> 47:28.671
I find meditation helps.

47:28.715 --> 47:30.717
There has to be something
that you could be doing.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.502
Oh, but I am. I'm thinking.

47:33.546 --> 47:34.895
Thinking?

47:34.939 --> 47:37.680
Yes. I find it's helpful, too.

47:37.724 --> 47:41.336
You know, sometimes I wonder
how you've survived this long.

47:41.380 --> 47:44.122
Well, that makes two of us.

47:44.165 --> 47:46.820
Is this your way of distancing
yourself from this operation?

47:46.864 --> 47:49.040
No, not at all.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.694
You already did that for me.

48:04.446 --> 48:05.926
Yeah.

48:19.461 --> 48:21.594
Anything?Nothing.

48:21.637 --> 48:25.119
All right,
she picked this up at 20:42.

48:25.163 --> 48:28.079
Logged out at 2100 hours.

48:28.122 --> 48:32.257
So she leaves this untouched,
takes off?

48:32.300 --> 48:34.433
Not according to
what she said to Ops.

48:34.476 --> 48:37.827
Well, maybe she got a hot lead
and took off in a hurry.

48:37.871 --> 48:39.612
Yeah, except Hidoko is
completely by the book.

48:39.655 --> 48:42.136
She should've been a lot more
careful, being here alone.

48:42.180 --> 48:43.790
Well, that's the bigger problem,
isn't it?

48:43.833 --> 48:45.487
Is that none of us
should be here.

48:45.531 --> 48:46.619
Okay, you know what, Deeks?

48:46.662 --> 48:47.968
Do me a favor
and don't jinx this.

48:48.012 --> 48:50.710
This was jinxed
long before I came on board.

48:53.843 --> 48:56.890
No sign of a struggle
or forced entry.

48:58.065 --> 49:01.242
All right. So where is she?

49:14.038 --> 49:15.996
SAM:
Hidoko was out here?

49:17.693 --> 49:20.174
It says we're
right on top of her.

49:29.879 --> 49:31.533
Leg okay?

49:36.625 --> 49:39.150
Apparently so.

49:39.193 --> 49:41.369
Try again.

49:43.197 --> 49:45.852
[recorded male voice
speaks Spanish over phone]

49:45.895 --> 49:47.332
Still out of service.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.551
You don't think
we're being set up, do you?

49:49.595 --> 49:52.163
We'll find out
soon enough.

49:52.206 --> 49:54.426
There's a lot of tracks.

49:54.469 --> 49:56.428
Somebody was up here.

49:56.471 --> 49:58.038
Yeah, several
different vehicles.

49:58.082 --> 49:59.431
G?

50:04.566 --> 50:06.525
That's one hell
of a campfire.

50:06.568 --> 50:08.440
Yeah.

50:08.483 --> 50:10.572
With bone fragments.

50:24.586 --> 50:26.153
MOSLEY:
What am I looking at?

50:26.197 --> 50:28.982
This is the last known position
of Hidoko's personal tracker.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.331
Callen and Sam are there now.

50:30.375 --> 50:32.942
There is no evidence
of Hidoko or her tracker.

50:32.986 --> 50:35.206
Well, maybe she had to dump it
to avoid being made.

50:35.249 --> 50:36.859
She may be off-line

50:36.903 --> 50:38.122
for her own safety.

50:38.165 --> 50:40.037
Hidoko is
a combat-tested Marine.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.777
CALLEN:
Who was out here without backup.

50:41.821 --> 50:43.605
You still have nothing from her?

50:43.649 --> 50:45.477
NELL:
Not since last night.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.609
MOSLEY: Okay, what about traffic
or surveillance cams

50:47.653 --> 50:49.133
ERIC: Uh, we don't have access
to those systems

50:49.176 --> 50:51.048
unless they're public,
but we do have a request in

50:51.091 --> 50:52.310
to the Mexican authorities
for assistance.

50:52.353 --> 50:54.355
Hold on. What do you got?

50:54.399 --> 50:57.532
Got a heel print; it's
small enough to be hers.

50:57.576 --> 51:00.013
Should be able to match it.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.710
MOSLEY:
Even if it does, all that proves

51:01.754 --> 51:03.495
is that she was there
and isn't now.

51:03.538 --> 51:05.192
All I know is somebody
burned something last night.

51:05.236 --> 51:06.889
I just hope it wasn't her.MOSLEY: Agent Callen,

51:06.933 --> 51:08.543
unless you have
real evidence,

51:08.587 --> 51:11.155
I would appreciate
you saving the speculation,

51:11.198 --> 51:13.331
and focus on finding
Agent Hidoko

51:13.374 --> 51:15.507
and extricating my son.

51:15.550 --> 51:17.639
Cut the call.
And you let me know

51:17.683 --> 51:19.728
the minute you find her.Yes, ma'am.

51:23.384 --> 51:25.343
She hung up.

51:25.386 --> 51:27.127
This just got real for her.

51:27.171 --> 51:30.435
She needs us
to find Hidoko.

51:30.478 --> 51:32.654
I'm not sure we haven't.

51:36.267 --> 51:39.922
Mr. Beale,
give this name to our team.

51:39.966 --> 51:42.577
This is someone
who might be able to help them.

51:42.621 --> 51:44.449
Miss Jones, with me.

51:47.234 --> 51:49.976
KENSI: You haven't said much
since we got here.

51:50.019 --> 51:52.283
Not a lot to talk about.No?

51:52.326 --> 51:54.154
Listen, I just want
to save this kid

51:54.198 --> 51:56.591
and get the hell out of here.And then what?

51:56.635 --> 51:58.027
I have no idea.

51:58.071 --> 51:59.333
Where's Hidoko?

52:00.726 --> 52:03.772
You didn't find her yet?Let's hope not.

52:03.816 --> 52:05.209
What does that mean?

52:06.601 --> 52:09.604
Means we'll need forensics
to confirm if what we found...

52:09.648 --> 52:10.605
Forensics?

52:10.649 --> 52:12.346
KENSI:
What are you saying?

52:12.390 --> 52:13.565
This is exactly
what I was talking about.CALLEN: Deeks, settle.

52:13.608 --> 52:15.044
We don't know what we found.

52:15.088 --> 52:16.437
All we know for sure is

52:16.481 --> 52:18.135
that her cell
and her tracker are off-line.

52:18.178 --> 52:19.962
Did you find anything?KENSI: No.

52:20.006 --> 52:22.878
Nothing yet. Nobody saw her with
visitors. Nobody saw her leave.

52:22.922 --> 52:25.838
No calls to her sat phone or
her room, but Hetty did give us

52:25.881 --> 52:28.275
a guy down here that
might be able to help.Who?

52:28.319 --> 52:30.277
His name is Turk. All we have
is a name and address.

52:30.321 --> 52:31.539
Let's get to it.

52:31.583 --> 52:33.933
Yeah.

52:33.976 --> 52:36.196
Deeks, you cool?

52:36.240 --> 52:37.980
What do you think?

52:48.034 --> 52:49.992
Yes?

52:50.036 --> 52:53.648
Well, I thought
I should... stop in.

52:53.692 --> 52:57.043
Does that mean
you're done thinking?

52:58.740 --> 53:01.830
I've given the team someone
who may be able to help them.

53:01.874 --> 53:04.311
And you waited until now
to do that?

53:04.355 --> 53:07.184
I was hoping
it wouldn't be necessary,

53:07.227 --> 53:11.318
but under the
circumstances...

53:11.362 --> 53:15.061
And just because he canhelp
doesn't mean he will.

53:15.104 --> 53:17.106
Wonderful.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.201
You've never lost an agent,
have you?

53:26.594 --> 53:28.553
No.

53:28.596 --> 53:30.381
And I still haven't.

53:30.424 --> 53:34.123
Hidoko's been radio-silent
for less than 12 hours.

53:35.777 --> 53:39.216
And is that what
your gut tells you?

53:49.008 --> 53:50.966
Well, I hope you're right.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.057
Nell is waiting for you
in the armory.

53:55.101 --> 53:57.016
Waiting for me for what?

53:57.059 --> 53:59.192
Hetty?

54:20.953 --> 54:22.650
You guys rent out these ATVs?

54:22.694 --> 54:24.652
Yes, sir.
How many for how long?

54:24.696 --> 54:27.002
Uh, four, couple hours.

54:27.046 --> 54:28.961
That's no problem.
They can help you out inside.Thanks.

54:29.004 --> 54:31.006
We got this.

54:32.660 --> 54:33.966
You Arlo Turk?

54:34.009 --> 54:35.315
I am. And you are?

54:35.359 --> 54:37.578
We're friends of Hetty.

54:39.145 --> 54:41.626
Henrietta Lang.

54:41.669 --> 54:43.410
Yeah, I get a lot of people
coming through here.

54:43.454 --> 54:45.325
What, she promise you
a discount or something?

54:45.369 --> 54:48.502
She said you might
be able to help us.

54:48.546 --> 54:50.809
How so?

54:50.852 --> 54:53.202
We have a friend we're supposed
to meet. She's gone missing.

54:53.246 --> 54:56.118
Well, she didn't turn up,
or missing missing?

54:56.162 --> 54:57.468
The latter.

54:58.991 --> 55:01.123
Did you contact the police?

55:01.167 --> 55:02.473
No.

55:02.516 --> 55:04.649
I see.

55:04.692 --> 55:06.825
Well, as much as

55:06.868 --> 55:09.610
I'd love to help you out,
I keep my nose clean.

55:09.654 --> 55:11.743
You'd be wise
to do the same.

55:11.786 --> 55:14.136
Anything else
I can help you with?

55:14.180 --> 55:15.964
Uh, yeah.

55:16.008 --> 55:19.359
Actually, I was wondering if
you could help us find a trail.

55:19.403 --> 55:21.840
All the trails are marked
on the map there.

55:21.883 --> 55:24.973
Yeah, but we were thinking about
doing a little off-roading.

55:25.017 --> 55:28.150
You know, maybe in, uh,
this area right there.

55:28.194 --> 55:29.978
I wouldn't do that.

55:30.022 --> 55:31.153
Why is that?

55:31.197 --> 55:33.242
Well, one, if you get stuck,

55:33.286 --> 55:36.202
it's a bitch for me to get my
truck in there and tow you out.

55:36.245 --> 55:38.160
Two, it's private land.

55:38.204 --> 55:40.946
They shoot first and
ask questions later down here.

55:40.989 --> 55:43.992
Gives new meaning to
the term "tourist trap."

55:44.036 --> 55:45.994
This ain't Disneyland, boys.

55:46.038 --> 55:49.346
Between the cartel,
the federales, the army,

55:49.389 --> 55:51.435
there's a million ways
for things to go bad down here,

55:51.478 --> 55:54.655
so... you stick to
the tourist areas,

55:54.699 --> 55:57.179
and you'll enjoy your vacation.

55:57.223 --> 55:59.225
Excuse me.

56:03.142 --> 56:05.231
You got something for me?

56:05.274 --> 56:06.928
Uh, sort of.

56:06.972 --> 56:08.277
Okay.

56:08.321 --> 56:10.105
What the hell is that?

56:10.149 --> 56:12.412
I need you to make a video
for your son.

56:12.456 --> 56:15.067
He has no idea
that we're coming.

56:15.110 --> 56:16.721
What we see as a rescue,

56:16.764 --> 56:18.679
he will see
as a stranger abduction.

56:18.723 --> 56:20.246
So, if we have a video

56:20.289 --> 56:22.944
for the team, explaining
that these are the good guys,

56:22.988 --> 56:25.033
that you're telling him
it's okay to go with them,

56:25.077 --> 56:26.426
that could be the difference

56:26.470 --> 56:27.862
between success
and failure here.

56:27.906 --> 56:30.648
All right. Okay.

56:30.691 --> 56:32.650
You want to do that right now?

56:32.693 --> 56:33.955
Sooner rather than later, right?

56:33.999 --> 56:35.348
Yeah.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.263
Okay.

56:37.306 --> 56:39.483

without being spotted.

surveillance cameras,

motion sensors
and roving patrols.

Wouldn't be surprised
if they had heat sensors, too.

59:34.179 --> 59:36.442
¿Dos Pueblos? Sí.

1:00:14.828 --> 1:00:16.134
Arlo.

1:00:16.177 --> 1:00:18.353
¿Paco, Ignacio, qué pasó?

1:00:18.397 --> 1:00:20.617
TURK: Bien. Bien.

1:00:59.917 --> 1:01:00.657
Thank you.

1:01:00.700 --> 1:01:02.223
I told you not to do this.

1:01:04.443 --> 1:01:05.574
You should have listened.

1:01:05.618 --> 1:01:09.361
Yeah. My bad.

1:01:09.404 --> 1:01:11.580
I'll load up your ride.

1:01:13.017 --> 1:01:14.671
You're on your own.
Don't get lost.

1:01:30.774 --> 1:01:34.429
How long
you been down here?

1:01:34.473 --> 1:01:36.344
Long enough.

1:01:38.390 --> 1:01:39.870
Okay, I'm just
a little bit curious.

1:01:39.913 --> 1:01:41.610
How did you know
we were in trouble?

1:01:41.654 --> 1:01:43.612
Sometimes you find yourself

1:01:43.656 --> 1:01:45.745
at the right place
at the right time.

1:01:47.616 --> 1:01:51.838
Look, Hetty said
you could help us.

1:01:51.882 --> 1:01:54.841
You two are alive,
aren't you?

1:01:54.885 --> 1:01:57.017
But that won't last.

1:01:57.061 --> 1:01:59.106
Go home now, all of you.

1:01:59.150 --> 1:02:01.065
Get your butts to the airport,
get on the next flight

1:02:01.108 --> 1:02:03.807
out of this hellhole, or you
will end up like your friend.

1:02:07.288 --> 1:02:09.290
How's that?

1:02:15.122 --> 1:02:17.516
For the remains,
the State Department

1:02:17.559 --> 1:02:20.171
contracts with a lab
in Mexico City for DNA testing.

1:02:20.214 --> 1:02:22.434
Okay. How fast can
we get some results?

1:02:22.477 --> 1:02:24.828
At least 24 hours.

1:02:24.871 --> 1:02:27.961
Hidoko's emergency contact
is her father in Baltimore.

1:02:28.005 --> 1:02:30.442
This is just a
normal day for him.

1:02:30.485 --> 1:02:31.791
He has no idea.

1:02:31.835 --> 1:02:35.012
Hey. We're not even
certain it's her.

1:02:37.710 --> 1:02:39.668
She's a year younger
than me, Eric.

1:02:39.712 --> 1:02:41.975
Nell...Even Sam was shot yesterday.

1:02:42.019 --> 1:02:43.107
Nell, stop.

1:02:44.369 --> 1:02:46.893
More troops at the villa.

1:02:46.937 --> 1:02:49.766
I really hope our guys
stay safe today.

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:52.769
I don't think I can take
any more bad news.

1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:01.081
Maybe Turk's right.

1:03:01.125 --> 1:03:03.954
Maybe we should just
get the hell out of Dodge.

1:03:03.997 --> 1:03:05.869
Not an option.KENSI: We've been through worse.

1:03:05.912 --> 1:03:09.481
This villa's got more firepower
than the North Korean border.

1:03:09.524 --> 1:03:11.788
Right now it does.
It could change.

1:03:11.831 --> 1:03:13.572
After the arms deal,
they'll let down their guard.

1:03:13.615 --> 1:03:15.269
When Williams leaves
the compound with his son,

1:03:15.313 --> 1:03:16.836
there's a window
of opportunity.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:18.403
Be easier than going in now.

1:03:18.446 --> 1:03:19.970
CALLEN: Unless, of course,
Williams has an armed escort

1:03:20.013 --> 1:03:21.406
or a private chopper,
in which case,

1:03:21.449 --> 1:03:22.755
we came down here for nada.

1:03:25.453 --> 1:03:27.499
Maybe we could get the kid
to leave the compound.

1:03:27.542 --> 1:03:28.979
KENSI:
Nah, it's unlikely.

1:03:29.022 --> 1:03:31.285
Ops has had their eyes on
the compound for 24 hours.

1:03:31.329 --> 1:03:33.853
Derrick hasn't even
stepped outside.

1:03:33.897 --> 1:03:36.334
What about a Trojan horse?

1:03:36.377 --> 1:03:38.945
Deeks, please.What? I'm serious.

1:03:38.989 --> 1:03:40.686
They're not letting anything
in there without a major search.

1:03:40.729 --> 1:03:42.993
I'm talking about real horses.

1:03:43.036 --> 1:03:44.995
What do we know?

1:03:45.038 --> 1:03:46.997
This kid is all alone,
his dad and the general

1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:48.389
off dealing with the cartels.

1:03:48.433 --> 1:03:50.870
So I show up with horses.
I say they're a gift.

1:03:50.914 --> 1:03:53.003
I take the kid
for a ride.

1:03:53.046 --> 1:03:54.874
A little fresh
air, right?
KENSI:
You could take

1:03:54.918 --> 1:03:57.224
the kid off the compound.Right, where you guys
are waiting

1:03:57.268 --> 1:03:59.574
to whisk him away
to the exfil site.

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:03.883
There is a chance
that could actually work.

1:04:03.927 --> 1:04:06.059
I like to call it
thinking outside the barn.

1:04:06.103 --> 1:04:08.540
SAM:
Hmm.

1:04:08.583 --> 1:04:10.368
But you shouldn't
bring the horses in.

1:04:10.411 --> 1:04:12.152
Why?

1:04:12.196 --> 1:04:14.241
It's a job for Kensi.

1:04:14.285 --> 1:04:16.287
No, no, no, no.SAM: Her Spanish is
better than yours,

1:04:16.330 --> 1:04:18.115
and she'll draw
less suspicion.

1:04:18.158 --> 1:04:20.552
No. I should do this because
we need Kensi as a sniper.

1:04:20.595 --> 1:04:22.249
CALLEN:
Sam's right.

1:04:22.293 --> 1:04:24.077
They'll be more inclined
to give the boy to Kens.

1:04:28.516 --> 1:04:30.475
Okay.

1:04:30.518 --> 1:04:32.477
Guess we're gonna need
two horses.

1:04:52.671 --> 1:04:55.065
What are you doing here?

1:04:55.108 --> 1:04:58.982
Not exactly a huge fan
of Señor Frog's.

1:04:59.025 --> 1:05:01.027
Besides, I like
to hang with the locals.

1:05:01.071 --> 1:05:04.770
You know, when somebody
gives you good advice,

1:05:04.813 --> 1:05:07.294
you should take it.

1:05:07.338 --> 1:05:10.776
So why don't you go find
another seat in another bar?

1:05:10.819 --> 1:05:13.605
Gracias.

1:05:13.648 --> 1:05:15.650
Salud.

1:05:19.002 --> 1:05:21.178
We still haven't
found my friend.

1:05:22.701 --> 1:05:24.659
You're not gonna find her.

1:05:24.703 --> 1:05:26.835
Not here.

1:05:26.879 --> 1:05:31.275
Just one thing,
and then I will disappear.

1:05:31.318 --> 1:05:33.320
Can you get me two horses
and a trailer?

1:05:35.105 --> 1:05:37.498
You're talking to
the wrong guy, pal.

1:05:37.542 --> 1:05:40.719
If it doesn't have an
engine, I can't help you.

1:05:55.429 --> 1:05:57.388
Anything?

1:05:57.431 --> 1:05:59.433
CALLEN:
Nothing.

1:06:12.925 --> 1:06:14.013
Incoming.

1:06:14.057 --> 1:06:15.972
Gracias.

1:06:19.758 --> 1:06:21.978
You lost something.

1:06:22.021 --> 1:06:24.023
What is this?

1:06:26.808 --> 1:06:29.115
Stay the hell away from me.

1:06:49.353 --> 1:06:50.441
CALLEN:
Real-time video

1:06:50.484 --> 1:06:51.790
inside the villa
will allow Eric and Nell

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:53.313
to guide us through
a nighttime extraction.

1:06:53.357 --> 1:06:54.488
I thought their security
system was air-gapped.

1:06:54.532 --> 1:06:55.620
Yeah, so how does
Ops tap in?

1:06:55.663 --> 1:06:57.056
It's a mobile transceiver.

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:58.710
Get it within 50 feet

1:06:58.753 --> 1:07:00.712
of the DVR,
it infects by Bluetooth,

1:07:00.755 --> 1:07:03.715
receives video images
and transmits them to the cloud.

1:07:07.762 --> 1:07:09.112
Marco.

1:07:10.548 --> 1:07:12.637
Sí.

1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:15.509
Ah. Here.

1:07:15.553 --> 1:07:17.511
Gracias. De nada.

1:07:24.562 --> 1:07:27.130
What are these?

1:07:28.827 --> 1:07:31.482
"Their names are
Símbolo and Mattila."

1:07:35.138 --> 1:07:36.443
Wow.

1:07:38.141 --> 1:07:40.317
Looks like
Turk came through.

1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:43.059
All for the small price
of a sucker punch.

1:07:46.888 --> 1:07:48.368
You up for this?

1:07:48.412 --> 1:07:50.109
Of course I am.

1:07:54.505 --> 1:07:56.507
SAM:
G.

1:08:00.511 --> 1:08:03.383
He must have really
felt bad about that punch.

1:08:03.427 --> 1:08:06.647
Some guys send flowers.

1:08:08.345 --> 1:08:10.651
NELL: So, Kensi takes the boy
on a half-mile loop,

1:08:10.695 --> 1:08:12.827
in plain sight of security.

1:08:12.871 --> 1:08:15.743
Once they relax, she'll ride
over this ridge, where Deeks is

1:08:15.787 --> 1:08:18.616
waiting in an SUV
out of sight.And Callen and Sam

1:08:18.659 --> 1:08:21.314
provide cover
should anything go wrong.

1:08:21.358 --> 1:08:23.795
So, this plan has
Mosley's blessing?

1:08:23.838 --> 1:08:26.014
Well, we'll run it by her
as soon as she gets in.

1:08:26.058 --> 1:08:28.147
She's not here?NELL: Mm-mm.

1:08:28.191 --> 1:08:29.279
Find her. Now.

1:08:29.322 --> 1:08:31.281
NELL:
As far as we know,

1:08:31.324 --> 1:08:33.152
she left after making the video
for her son yesterday afternoon.

1:08:33.196 --> 1:08:35.285
ERIC:
Her cell phone is off-line.

1:08:35.328 --> 1:08:37.983
Last tracked
at the Santa Monica Airport.

1:08:38.026 --> 1:08:39.985
Do you think
she's heading for Mexico?

1:08:40.028 --> 1:08:41.508
HETTY: Oh, Lord.
Alert the team.

1:08:41.552 --> 1:08:45.425
They need to execute their plan
before Mosley has a chance

1:08:45.469 --> 1:08:46.644
to do something stupid.

1:08:46.687 --> 1:08:47.688
Copy that.

1:09:54.625 --> 1:09:56.148
DEEKS:
All right.

1:09:56.192 --> 1:09:58.237
Callen, I'm in position.
Ready to roll.

1:09:58.281 --> 1:10:00.239
Copy that.

1:11:08.307 --> 1:11:11.049
Gracias.

1:11:27.283 --> 1:11:28.719
Okay.

1:11:28.762 --> 1:11:30.373
That went pretty well.

1:11:30.416 --> 1:11:33.680
So, last night, Mosley used a
peer-to-peer sharing service

1:11:33.724 --> 1:11:35.421
that lets you
book empty seats

1:11:35.465 --> 1:11:37.684
on private jets already
scheduled to fly.

1:11:37.728 --> 1:11:39.425
Hmm, like Airbnb.
Yeah.

1:11:39.469 --> 1:11:41.209
Except you're actually
in the air.

1:11:41.253 --> 1:11:43.124
Okay, so,
where is she headed?

1:11:43.168 --> 1:11:45.039
Mazatlán.
It's 200 miles

1:11:45.083 --> 1:11:46.040
from Los Mochis.

1:11:46.084 --> 1:11:47.520
Huh. And after she landed?

1:11:47.564 --> 1:11:49.217
No idea. No credit
card activity

1:11:49.261 --> 1:11:51.568
at hotels
or rental car companies.

1:11:51.611 --> 1:11:53.874
Right. She must be dealing
in cash and using an alias.

1:11:53.918 --> 1:11:56.181
It's a three-hour flight,
and then a four-hour drive.

1:11:56.224 --> 1:12:00.011
Plenty of time
to muck the whole thing up.

1:12:07.801 --> 1:12:10.282
JUANA:
Buenas tardes.

1:12:54.021 --> 1:12:56.328
Oh, God.
What if she tries to call him?

1:12:56.372 --> 1:12:57.460
CALLEN:
Eric, any chance

1:12:57.503 --> 1:12:58.983
you could jam
the nanny's phone?

1:12:59.026 --> 1:13:00.376
Not from here.

1:13:00.419 --> 1:13:02.378
Disable a cell tower?

1:13:02.421 --> 1:13:03.901
Not without a hand grenade.

1:13:03.944 --> 1:13:06.033
Guys, we need
to get her out of there.

1:13:06.077 --> 1:13:08.166
Kensi, abort.

1:13:08.209 --> 1:13:10.298
We'll think of
something else.

1:13:10.342 --> 1:13:12.083
Kensi, do you copy?

1:13:12.126 --> 1:13:14.651
CALLEN: Kensi, you need
to get out of there now.

1:13:21.179 --> 1:13:22.572
CALLEN:
Kensi, listen to me.

1:13:22.615 --> 1:13:25.488
Get in the truck
and drive away now!

1:13:28.447 --> 1:13:30.493
: Oh, crap.
Spencer Williams is here.

1:13:30.536 --> 1:13:32.538
Don't let her leave!

1:13:41.765 --> 1:13:43.114
What's happening?

1:13:44.768 --> 1:13:46.160
Kens?

1:13:53.733 --> 1:13:55.561
Who are you?

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:02.089
Callen?

1:14:02.133 --> 1:14:03.482
Callen.

1:14:03.526 --> 1:14:04.483
Stand by.

1:14:04.527 --> 1:14:05.876
WILLIAMS:
That's funny.

1:14:05.919 --> 1:14:09.662
The general didn't say anything
to me about this.

1:14:12.317 --> 1:14:13.536
DEEKS:
Callen?

1:14:14.928 --> 1:14:16.713
Callen, what's the plan?

1:14:18.454 --> 1:14:20.456
Callen!

1:14:32.685 --> 1:14:34.644
That's it, I'm going in!

1:14:34.687 --> 1:14:36.036
Deeks, stand down.

1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:37.298
Kensi's in trouble.

1:14:37.342 --> 1:14:38.561
I'm going to get her.

1:14:38.604 --> 1:14:40.519
Deeks, you do this,
you'll both get killed.

1:14:40.563 --> 1:14:41.520
Deeks, stop!

1:14:43.391 --> 1:14:47.004
All right, then, guys, we need
to get her out of there now.

1:14:47.047 --> 1:14:49.006
How many bogeys
in the compound, Eric?

1:14:49.049 --> 1:14:50.616
Uh, six that
we've identified,

1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:52.575
plus the two-man roving patrol.

1:14:52.618 --> 1:14:54.228
CALLEN: Any sign of the general?Not yet.

1:14:54.272 --> 1:14:55.621
NELL:
Hey, guys, this probably

1:14:55.665 --> 1:14:57.057
isn't the best time
to tell you this,

1:14:57.101 --> 1:14:59.756
but Mosley hopped a jet
last night to Mazatlán.

1:15:01.584 --> 1:15:03.455
What, are you serious? What
does she think she's gonna do?

1:15:03.499 --> 1:15:04.978
Not a clue.

1:15:05.022 --> 1:15:07.415
This could go
seven different ways of bad.

1:15:07.459 --> 1:15:09.113
Yeah, Sam, I heard that.ERIC: I could call in

1:15:09.156 --> 1:15:10.897
a bomb threat, try to
flush out the compound.

1:15:10.941 --> 1:15:12.464
No. Kensi's already
put them on alert.

1:15:12.508 --> 1:15:14.422
Anything else will put them
on total lockdown.

1:15:14.466 --> 1:15:15.989
We need to be smart about this.

1:15:16.033 --> 1:15:17.338
We need to be fast about this.

1:15:17.382 --> 1:15:19.689
Callen, what are we doing?

1:15:19.732 --> 1:15:21.081
Give me a second.

1:15:21.125 --> 1:15:22.213
DEEKS:
I'm done talking about this.

1:15:22.256 --> 1:15:24.694

Give me the camo stick.

1:15:37.054 --> 1:15:39.143
Got a knife?

1:15:39.186 --> 1:15:40.579
What are you doing?

1:15:40.623 --> 1:15:41.841
Something I learned

1:15:41.885 --> 1:15:44.017
from watching too much
wrestling as a kid.

1:15:47.020 --> 1:15:49.283
Yeah.

1:15:49.327 --> 1:15:51.285
Okay, that hurt.

1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:23.753
Clear?

1:16:26.190 --> 1:16:28.496
Roving threat is neutralized.

1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:29.846
Nicely done.

1:16:29.889 --> 1:16:30.847
Now what?

1:16:30.890 --> 1:16:32.936
Now we get inside.

1:16:47.341 --> 1:16:49.039
You ready to roll, Deeks?

1:16:49.082 --> 1:16:51.911
Yes. Let's go, let's go!

1:16:51.955 --> 1:16:54.261
Kensi, sit tight. We're coming.

1:16:54.305 --> 1:16:56.133
So, what was the plan?

1:16:56.176 --> 1:16:59.049
Kidnap my son?
Hold him for ransom?

1:16:59.092 --> 1:17:00.703
Hmm?

1:17:04.315 --> 1:17:07.057
You look like a flakagirl.

1:17:08.798 --> 1:17:10.756

sent here to kill me?

1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:13.106
Hmm? No hablo inglés.

1:17:13.150 --> 1:17:15.718
Hmm. Okay.

1:17:15.761 --> 1:17:18.416
You will be speaking in tongues
by the time the general

1:17:18.459 --> 1:17:20.374
and his men
are done with you.

1:17:20.418 --> 1:17:21.767
They'll probably

1:17:21.811 --> 1:17:25.249
peel that pretty face
right off your skull.

1:17:35.694 --> 1:17:37.043
What the hell?!

1:18:06.507 --> 1:18:08.596
Guys, I'm free.

more than you can imagine.

1:19:04.914 --> 1:19:07.177

1:19:07.220 --> 1:19:09.048

your father once you come home.
