12:39.709 --> 12:42.584

I'm not shocked if you don't.

12:42.584 --> 12:44.334

12:59.792 --> 13:02.251
Um, I want to apologize
to my family,

13:02.251 --> 13:04.168
and my friends
who've been affected,

13:04.168 --> 13:07.500
and to everyone that I hurt,
'cause I'm realizing now
I hurt a lot of people,

13:07.500 --> 13:10.084
and that was never my intention.

13:10.084 --> 13:12.168
You know, I have less
than 20,000 followers.

13:12.168 --> 13:13.834

23:49.334 --> 23:51.168
You guys did such a good job.

23:51.168 --> 23:52.625
Dan:
Thank you!

23:52.625 --> 23:54.042
It's coming along.

23:54.042 --> 23:55.917
And you're going to Iceland
next week, man?

23:55.917 --> 23:57.625
I've always wanted
to go to Iceland.

23:57.625 --> 23:59.001
Yeah!
When are you leaving?

23:59.001 --> 24:00.834
Next Wednesday.
I'm fucking excited!

24:00.834 --> 24:03.001
Oh, I bet.
It's honestly the most
beautiful place on Earth.

24:03.001 --> 24:04.709
Yeah, what are you gonna do
when you get there?

24:04.709 --> 24:07.334
Oh, well, I got the
whole thing planned out.

24:07.334 --> 24:09.001
We're going to Reykjavík,

24:09.001 --> 24:10.834
and we're gonna
land there first.

24:10.834 --> 24:14.625
Uh-huh.
I got one of those
Mercedes Sprinter RVs.

24:14.625 --> 24:17.459
And we're gonna camp
all the way around
the countryside.

24:17.459 --> 24:19.126
Oh. On that Ring Road?
Just camping out.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.293
Exactly!
That is--

24:20.293 --> 24:22.084
We're bringing our bikes.
It's gonna be sick!

24:22.084 --> 24:24.251
Hello, hello!
Oh, hey, man!
Hey!

24:24.251 --> 24:25.834
What's up?
Oh, not much.

24:25.834 --> 24:27.209
You know,
a slave to the job.

24:27.209 --> 24:28.542
Oh, I get it.

24:28.542 --> 24:29.959

24:29.959 --> 24:31.876

24:33.209 --> 24:34.584

24:34.584 --> 24:37.084
Oh, I fucking knew it!

24:37.084 --> 24:39.542
Iceland!
Damn, you motherfucker,
done ruined the surprise!

24:39.542 --> 24:41.959
I knew it!
Dude, it was my second guess!

24:41.959 --> 24:44.418
Motherfucker!
Just--

24:44.418 --> 24:45.834
Hey Jim, what's up, man?

24:45.834 --> 24:48.168
Jim :

24:57.334 --> 24:58.709

25:12.084 --> 25:14.084

25:14.084 --> 25:15.209

25:15.209 --> 25:16.959
Yeah, Jimmy.
How are ya?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.750
Oh, Jesus.
You okay?

25:20.750 --> 25:24.084
I'm dancing.
Yeah, he said you're doing
a dance marathon.

25:25.209 --> 25:26.251
Oh, hi.

25:28.459 --> 25:31.750
Oh, wow.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.084
You're gonna dance
for a whole nother day?

25:34.084 --> 25:37.042
Well, that's what they say.

25:37.042 --> 25:40.334
Well, Jim asked me
to get you a little something.

25:40.334 --> 25:43.042
No, Jimmy...
To help you out here.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.834
Maybe this'll help.

25:45.834 --> 25:47.792
Do you want me
to light it for you?
Oh.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.376
Sucio.

25:49.376 --> 25:50.917
Sucio?
Mmm.

25:55.168 --> 25:57.001
I'll dance with you.

25:57.001 --> 25:58.126
You're sweet.

25:58.126 --> 26:00.834
Here you go.
Everybody left.

26:00.834 --> 26:02.625
Everyone left?
Mmm.

26:02.625 --> 26:05.917
Yeah, I imagine
it's probably pretty hard
to do this without people here.

26:05.917 --> 26:07.625
It's not child's play.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.334
No.

26:11.376 --> 26:12.959
Pretty good, huh?

26:12.959 --> 26:14.750
This is Amnesia Haze.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.418
Oh!

26:16.418 --> 26:18.459
You know, it's like, uh...

26:20.209 --> 26:22.376
Mm, I'm not afraid
of death, you know?

26:22.376 --> 26:23.917
What?

26:23.917 --> 26:25.293
Never have been.

26:28.792 --> 26:30.334
Mm-mm.

26:32.876 --> 26:35.084
Oh. Still dancing.

26:35.084 --> 26:36.667
Mm-hmm.
Still dancing.

26:37.876 --> 26:41.126
Before you came,
I was really thirsty.

26:41.126 --> 26:45.625
And I was thinking about
the caves of Lascaux.

26:45.625 --> 26:48.500
Lascaux?
You know 'em?

26:48.500 --> 26:50.418
In France,

26:50.418 --> 26:53.959
where the Neanderthals
and Homo sapiens

26:53.959 --> 26:56.168
gathered together
at the same time,

26:56.168 --> 26:58.209
there was overlapping.

26:59.667 --> 27:01.959
And...

27:01.959 --> 27:04.876
the ones who made
the art won.

27:04.876 --> 27:06.876
That's what they saw

27:06.876 --> 27:09.042
in the layers
of the caves at Lat--

27:09.042 --> 27:11.418
No, Germany,
not Lascaux.

27:11.418 --> 27:15.084
And they...

27:15.084 --> 27:16.876
sang.
