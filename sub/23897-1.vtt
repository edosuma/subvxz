- (PEOPLE CHEERING)
- MAX: Whoo!

00:44.840 --> 00:47.035
(LAUGHS) Who cares about
winning? Let's get drunk!

00:47.720 --> 00:49.199
Let's do it.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.748
Let's get you drunk, Merkins.
You, too, Borgs.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.671
I'm thirsty. Huh?

00:54.880 --> 00:57.189
I need four shots of vodka,
four shots of water.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.176
I want you to send the vodka
over to the Merkins.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.918
Send the water to us. You understand?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.696
CARTER: What former
Supreme Court Justice...

01:02.720 --> 01:04.312
- Oliver Wendell Holmes!
- Correct.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.753
ALL: Yes!

01:05.840 --> 01:08.479
Again, I'd like to ask the players
to allow me to...

01:08.560 --> 01:10.198
T o finish the question.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.713
- (ALL LAUGHING)
- Very funny.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.911
Okay, okay.
This is getting embarrassing,

01:14.000 --> 01:15.877
so we need to focus

01:16.040 --> 01:17.473
because this isn't a game.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.159
It literally is.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.595
Bill, do not test me right now.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.360
CARTER: Looks like
we're down to two teams.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.910
So, for double points,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.275
what is the name
of the purple Teletubby?

01:29.080 --> 01:31.640
BOTH: Tinky Winky!
CARTER: You're both correct.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.758
He always carried a...

01:34.920 --> 01:36.672
- Red purse.
- Yeah.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.479
- And he loved big hugs.
- Big hugs.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.551
I know. I'm Max.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.073
Annie.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.136
Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able
to hold on to Asia! You hear me?

02:03.160 --> 02:05.310
Hey, if you take Kamchatka,
and I take Mongolia,

02:05.520 --> 02:06.880
we could trap Linda in the middle.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.056
- MAX: Starve out her armies.
- Hey!

02:08.080 --> 02:09.229
You can't form alliances.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.078
Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?

02:11.240 --> 02:12.958
You're high-fiving Hitler?

02:15.280 --> 02:17.111
MAX: All right, you got this. Last one.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.439
Oh, that's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.789
- (ALL GROAN)
- Yes!

02:21.960 --> 02:22.960
I'm up. I feel good.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.195
Two words.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.873
Bill. Overweight.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.195
- No.
- Single. Out of work.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.280
What the fuck?

02:28.360 --> 02:29.679
Hairy.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.319
Uh, carry, marry.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.549
Marry!

02:32.720 --> 02:34.358
You. Me.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.440
Marry me?

02:35.520 --> 02:37.160
- (WHOOPING)
- Dude, we got it! We got it!

02:37.640 --> 02:39.710
Annie, will you?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.279
- (GASPS)
- Will you marry me?

02:41.360 --> 02:42.840
- Is that a yes? That's a yes!
- Yeah!

02:42.960 --> 02:45.110
I'm really happy for you guys.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.400
(ALL CHEERING)

02:59.000 --> 03:00.720
ANNIE: Ooh, lot of pressure here.
MAX: Yeah.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.120
ANNIE: You miss, you lose it all.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.235
MAX: Stay out of my head.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.256
And you know you have a distinct
advantage with the smaller hands, right?

03:05.280 --> 03:06.759
Your goal posts are not as big.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.696
Well, I guess you
should've married Uma Thurman.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.960
Yeah, that would've been great.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.200
- There's a snap. Here's the hold.
- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)

03:12.800 --> 03:14.279
- Ooh!
- And a text.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.554
That was interference.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.296
ANNIE: Sorry, honey. I know how much
that meant to you.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.878
MAX: Come on.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.279
Dr. Chin is ready for you.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.429
Uh, great.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.193
I think we've determined why you've
been having trouble conceiving.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.954
MAX: Okay. Let's have it.
ANNIE: Okay, great.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.315
Oh, what's that look? Is it me?
Of course, it's me.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.470
I'm not loving your semen.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.629
Oh?

03:32.720 --> 03:35.712
Your count is excellent,
but your motility is well below normal.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.757
- That's too bad.
- What would cause that?

03:37.920 --> 03:40.753
It can be genetic,
environmental factors.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.229
Nine times out of 10, though,
it's psychological.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.914
Have you been feeling
anxious or stressed?

03:46.120 --> 03:48.236
No, I don't think so. Not really.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.879
Uh... He's always a little stressed.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.056
You don't have to write... I'm not...

03:52.080 --> 03:53.240
Honey, she's writing it down.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.591
Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.720
We sure are.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.416
One of the reasons
I fell in love with him.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.274
Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more
prone to stress than normal people.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.351
"Normal people"?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.776
How long has this been going on, Max?

04:06.800 --> 04:07.994
It's not going on.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.948
Oh, well, you did say,
even when you were a kid,

04:11.040 --> 04:13.110
you would freak out
if you lost at anything.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.816
- Oh, I was a kid.
- Especially if you lost to your brother.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.954
Hmm.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.397
Hey, is that what this is?

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
No.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.269
You have been so uptight since you
found out that Brooks is coming to town.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.936
- I don't think that's true.
- Could that be a factor in all this?

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
Let's be fair.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.349
Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.510
Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.272
- The what?
- The brothers.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.000
I'm not sure why we're discussing this.
She's not a therapist.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.151
You're not a therapist, right?
With all respect.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.833
- No, but I am a doctor.
- Sure.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.876
And I believe in
treating the whole patient.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.032
So, what is it about your brother
that makes you feel emasculated?

04:45.200 --> 04:46.633
Are we gonna do this?

04:46.800 --> 04:48.616
We're right next to the room
where I masturbated.

04:48.640 --> 04:52.030
I think he has it in his head
that Brooks is cooler

04:52.120 --> 04:55.192
and more successful
and hotter than he is.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.554
I never said hotter.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.199
He's charming.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.675
That's interesting. And is he single?

05:00.840 --> 05:01.840
MAX: What's that?

05:01.920 --> 05:05.196
I don't know if I mentioned it, but
Keith and I are on a trial separation.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.599
- Oh.
- Keith?

05:07.160 --> 05:08.195
Uh, Keith.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.536
So, do you think your brother would
wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.629
Gosh, I don't know.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.199
Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.793
Hurts a little. (SCOFFS)

05:15.000 --> 05:17.389
Now, is he a tall fellow?
'Cause I'm only 5'2".

05:17.560 --> 05:18.913
We're all done with my semen?

05:19.080 --> 05:20.513
He is taller than Max.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.910
- Good.
- But he did date this ballerina once,

05:23.000 --> 05:24.797
and she was
just a teeny-tiny little thing.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.274
Ooh.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.715
Honey, Gary.
Don't mention game night, okay?

05:47.800 --> 05:48.835
Mmm-hmm.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.717
- Good evening, Max.
- Hey, Gary.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.074
- Annie.
- Hello there.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.832
Hi, Gary!

05:54.320 --> 05:55.833
Just checking the mail.

05:55.920 --> 05:56.955
Oh, yeah?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.616
Some people check it earlier in the day,

05:58.640 --> 06:02.474
but there's always a risk
that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.

06:03.480 --> 06:07.837
This spares me the chance
of a futile trip to the mailbox.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.629
Uh-huh.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.032
Plus, it allows Bastian here
the opportunity to urinate.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.838
You have a good one.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.194
Any plans for this evening?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.634
MAX: No.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.679
Perhaps a game night?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.239
We're just gonna stay in,

06:24.360 --> 06:25.634
- just the two of us.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.312
- Boring.
- Mmm.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.799
I see.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.835
I do hope you keep me in mind
for any future game nights.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.040
You bet.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.829
I've always enjoyed
the camaraderie of good friends

06:40.040 --> 06:42.952
competing in games of chance and skill.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.273
(STAMMERING) Yeah.
Yeah, well, we'll do that,

06:46.440 --> 06:50.069
but tonight, it's just the two of us.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.752
Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.949
There was a special on these tonight.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.589
Three for one.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.159
Three for one?

07:05.800 --> 07:06.835
Yup.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.115
How can that be profitable
for Frito Lay?

07:10.360 --> 07:12.237
These corporations,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.440
- I don't know what they're doing.
- (CHUCKLES)

07:15.840 --> 07:18.400
Well, you two enjoy each other.

07:19.200 --> 07:23.671
It's often we don't appreciate
what we have until it's gone.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.672
MAX: I think that's it.
ANNIE: Okay.

07:29.880 --> 07:30.995
Bye-bye!

07:37.280 --> 07:39.510
If Gary sees the others coming,
we're screwed.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.936
No, no, honey,
it's not gonna be a problem.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.076
I was very, very clear with everyone
to park far away

07:43.240 --> 07:45.117
and just to sneak in quietly, you know.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.794
But now, I mean, you don't think
we're being dicks, do you?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.416
I mean,
should we just still invite the guy?

07:49.440 --> 07:50.656
He really seemed like he wanted to play.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.511
No, no. Debbie was our friend,

07:52.680 --> 07:54.856
and Gary was just the creepy husband
that we had to put up with.

07:54.880 --> 07:55.880
That's true.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.496
He's only gotten worse
since the divorce.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.273
Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?
Fuck him!

08:00.360 --> 08:01.509
(RUSTLING)

08:21.840 --> 08:22.840
(ANNIE SCREAMS)

08:26.880 --> 08:27.995
Hi!

08:28.160 --> 08:29.559
Hi.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.552
ANNIE: Can we help you?

08:34.720 --> 08:35.914
I'm okay.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.280
Hey!

08:37.440 --> 08:39.376
Of course. Ryan, why are you
coming in through the window?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.676
You said sneak in
so RoboCop wouldn't see us.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.200
I meant sneak in through the door.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.514
Well, you were super vague.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.920
- I wasn't vague at all.
- Wine?

08:47.040 --> 08:48.616
I know I didn't say,
"Break the succulents."

08:48.640 --> 08:50.870
- RYAN: Hey.
- I'm not dressed for this nonsense.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
This is ridiculous.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.096
It's like
Night of the Living Dead in here.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.720
Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.216
MAX: I didn't say
to come through the window.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.760
This is Max. We used to work together.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.016
- His wife, Annie. Michelle.
- Hey!

08:59.040 --> 09:00.040
And that guy, Kevin.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.216
- What's up, buddy?
- The door was right there.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.275
Guys, this is Madison.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.713
Yeah, you brought her last week.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.757
You work at Forever 21, right?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.956
- MAX: No, no.
- I work at Sephora.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.395
- I'm confused.
- Different girl.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.879
Same look, same voice.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.109
Nice to meet you.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.840
- You, too.
- (MADISON AND MAX CHUCKLE)

09:17.080 --> 09:18.559
- That's yours.
- It's...

09:18.720 --> 09:20.711
No. I think you're
supposed to kiss it, right?

09:20.880 --> 09:21.915
Welcome.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.473
Do you guys have a bathroom?

09:23.640 --> 09:25.016
There's one just down the hall.
You need it?

09:25.040 --> 09:28.191
Okay, is it on the right or the left?
I don't wanna go in the wrong room.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.509
The one with the toilet.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.749
- Can't miss it.
- Okay.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.438
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:33.560 --> 09:34.993
- Oh, boy.
- Dude!

09:35.160 --> 09:37.196
- Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?
- Right?

09:37.360 --> 09:38.634
No, at Chipotle.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.856
Let me ask you something, Ryan.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.576
Aren't you sick of
losing game night every week

09:41.600 --> 09:42.776
because of the dates you bring?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.711
They're not always that bad.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.712
(IMITATES VELOCIRAPTOR)

09:47.880 --> 09:48.915
Heather, seriously.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.160
How many photos of you
with the dog filter do you need?

09:52.880 --> 09:55.030
Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.800
Uh, yeah, it is.
It's my daddy's name, so...

09:57.960 --> 10:00.713
These are the elite,
the very best, the...

10:00.800 --> 10:01.869
Oh, oh! White people!

10:01.960 --> 10:03.552
- What?
- Oh, Jesus.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.834
Okay, unlike you psychos,

10:05.040 --> 10:06.800
I don't give a shit
about winning game night.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.479
I don't need that validation.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.921
But you do need the validation
of dating Instagram models?

10:11.040 --> 10:12.075
Absolutely.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.549
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I'm not like you, Michelle.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.188
We didn't all meet our soul mate
when we were 10 years old.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.280
14.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.360
- Oh, sorry.
- 14.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.160
And we didn't get married
until we were 19.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.992
- See, that's gross.
- You know what, Ryan?

10:23.080 --> 10:25.275
I hope one day you
get to meet a lovely, young lady.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.896
So you can love her as much as
I love my sweet baby right here.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.717
Yes, find her. Look how cute this...

10:29.880 --> 10:31.176
- Hey, look at this.
- So much love.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.256
Let's look at him when we do it.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.776
- Hey, everybody, grab your drinks.
- MICHELLE: Find the love!

10:33.800 --> 10:35.028
Let's go play, come on.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.476
Dude, do you know what rich people are
doing on their game nights these days?

10:38.640 --> 10:39.959
What's that?

10:40.160 --> 10:41.440
- (WHISPERS) Fight clubs.
- What?

10:41.520 --> 10:42.669
I just read about them.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.910
They pay poor people
to fight each other,

10:45.040 --> 10:46.216
and then they bet on the winner.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.960
- No, that's not a real thing.
- Yes, it is!

10:48.080 --> 10:49.816
If you can have anything
you want in this world,

10:49.840 --> 10:51.956
you have to raise the stakes,
or life gets boring.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.320
The Kennedys used to have fight clubs
at their compound.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.336
Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading
BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.056
How about some charades?
Huh, should we start with charades?

10:59.080 --> 11:00.136
RYAN: Let's go!
MICHELLE: Yeah!

11:00.160 --> 11:01.309
It's been a while, huh?

11:01.480 --> 11:02.879
Do you wanna wait for Brooks?

11:03.040 --> 11:04.256
I don't think we need to. No, he's late.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.555
- Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?
- MAX: Yeah.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.936
I thought he was working in Europe.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.315
He was, yeah. He's apparently back
for some business.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.520
Haven't seen him yet.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.830
- But we can get started.
- Yeah!

11:14.000 --> 11:16.096
- MAX: Who wants to start?
- Who are you guys talking about?

11:16.120 --> 11:18.759
Max's brother. He's this super
successful venture capitalist.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.480
Yeah, he was the first to invest
in Panera Bread, you know?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.358
The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.920
- A lot of investors.
- KEVIN: Yeah.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.840
He's like the Mark Wahlberg
to Max's Donnie.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.915
Well...

11:28.040 --> 11:29.109
Which is a huge compliment

11:29.200 --> 11:31.714
because Donnie was fucking great
in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?

11:31.800 --> 11:32.915
He was.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.399
Was he in The Sixth Sense?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.800
He sure is, yeah.
You know who is not in The Sixth Sense?

11:36.880 --> 11:37.995
Mark Wahlberg.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.594
Mark would never take a role that small.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.396
Is that right, Madison?

11:44.560 --> 11:45.976
Man, I haven't seen him
since the wedding.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.991
- Remember that speech he gave?
- Yes.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.736
And then he paid
for that whole firework display!

11:49.760 --> 11:51.016
- Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!
- Little over the top.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.680
Let's get started.
I'm gonna start us off.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.216
- Yes, let's start!
- Here we go. Let's do it.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.016
- We gotta pick teams first.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.136
ANNIE: Movie?
MICHELLE: It's a movie. Okay.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.936
RYAN: Dude, we have no teams.
KEVIN: You just give up?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.473
Better not be Brooks.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.353
(TIRES SCREECHING)

12:14.800 --> 12:16.916
You didn't tell him
to park up the street?

12:17.080 --> 12:18.479
I did, yeah, like, three times.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.548
Hey!

12:21.560 --> 12:23.790
He got a Stingray, huh?

12:27.160 --> 12:28.593

Hello, again.

Mmm...

12:35.920 --> 12:37.672
Still wearing the uniform.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.433
Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.591
I hope you didn't start
game night without me.

(MAX SHUSHING)

12:44.560 --> 12:45.709
Did you not get my text?

12:45.880 --> 12:47.313
What text?

12:47.760 --> 12:49.079
Oh, hello, Officer.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.592
Why's that guy staring at us?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.480
Gary, I want you
to meet my brother, Brooks.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.070
We're having a little family
three-man game night tonight.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.560
Wait, what do you mean three-man?

12:59.640 --> 13:01.296
You said that Michelle
and Ryan and Kevin were...

13:01.320 --> 13:02.799
No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.160
I can see them in the doorway.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.117
There's a whole mess of people.
Hey, guys!

13:06.280 --> 13:07.713
MAX: There they are.
RYAN: Hey!

13:07.880 --> 13:09.154
These guys are leaving.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.240
Take off, guys.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.550
We had a little bit
of a mix-up with the, um...

13:13.600 --> 13:14.874
- God damn it!
- What?

13:15.040 --> 13:16.896
We didn't want him to know
that we're having a game night.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.310
He used to come, and we don't
like him anymore, so...

13:20.400 --> 13:21.628
Oh.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.359
You know, I think he knows now.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.669
He sure does.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.276
Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.513
(LAUGHS) I haven't seen you in a year!

13:31.680 --> 13:34.638
Hey, you smell good.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.997
What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?
Head and Shoulders?

13:38.160 --> 13:39.800
Why do you assume
it's a dandruff shampoo?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.336
Well, I mean, you've always
been a little bit of a snowstorm.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.816
- Hey, would you hold that for a second?
- Yup.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.909
Hey, guys!

13:45.080 --> 13:47.594
Well, you look good, stranger.

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
It's been forever.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.632
I know, and that's my fault.
I'm so sorry.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.188
Sweet ride, Brooks.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.296
Oh, you like that?
I just got her a couple weeks ago.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.469
What is that? A Corvette?

13:55.640 --> 13:58.552
It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.

13:58.720 --> 13:59.914
It was my dream car as a kid.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.991
And that's what
gave me the idea to get it.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.957
You know what? I love your house.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.115
Are you being sarcastic?

14:06.320 --> 14:07.480
No, I mean I love your house.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.198
It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.793
Makes me think of simpler times.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.313
"Simpler"?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.391
Uh, so, how long are you in town for?

14:14.480 --> 14:15.549
You know, I'm not sure.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.119
It depends on how many clients

14:38.720 --> 14:40.631
- Quick story.
- There's no pausing.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.496
You remember the urban myth where
Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out

14:43.520 --> 14:44.760
so he could go down on himself?

14:44.920 --> 14:45.955
ALL: Yeah.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.456
You don't mind me telling the story,
do you, Max?

14:47.480 --> 14:48.600
You're in the middle of a...

14:48.640 --> 14:50.835
You were 14 years old.
It's an adorable story.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I forbid it.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.350
I'm a little curious.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.317
Did you blow yourself?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.176

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
Yeah.

Max took one of those bungee cords,
and he put it around his neck.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.480
Here he goes.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.936
And then he wrapped it behind his legs

down into his crotch,

17:34.080 --> 17:35.274
- Oh, boy.
- Mmm.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.395
Promise?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.536
Good night, everybody.
I love you much. Drive safely.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.675
- Kisses!
- All right.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.398
KEVIN: Take it easy.
ALL: Bye.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.199
That little motherfucker.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.675
Whoa!

17:45.760 --> 17:47.955
Well, I mean, come on.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.111
We don't see him in over a year.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.840
He shows up in your dream car,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.878
insults our house, and then tells
an embarrassing story about you

17:56.040 --> 17:58.200
right before your turn
just to throw you off your game.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.040
Welcome to my whole life. Why are you
suddenly so worked up about it?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.920
Well, cause now
he's messing with your balls

18:03.080 --> 18:05.036
and literally killing
millions of our babies.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.838
Well, that's a little dramatic,

18:07.000 --> 18:08.956
but, yeah, you know,
I mean, that's Brooks.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.280
I thought that this
was just regular old brother stuff,

18:11.360 --> 18:12.656
- but I totally see it now.
- Mmm-mmm.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.591
He undermines you every chance he gets.

18:14.680 --> 18:15.795
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.757
- It's crazy!
- Thank you, Annie.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.036
You know, I've never won
a single game against him.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.240
I just...

18:21.320 --> 18:23.914
I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.394
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.560
What are you suggesting?

18:27.720 --> 18:29.790
I'm suggesting we beat his ass.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.797
Jesus Christ.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.952
Good evening.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.031
- We're gonna skip the cleanup?
- (CHUCKLES)

18:42.440 --> 18:44.158
Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?

18:44.320 --> 18:46.038
No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.536
- I'm gonna stay alert and ready.
- GARY: Evening!

18:47.560 --> 18:48.720
- Jesus, Gary!
- (ANNIE GASPS)

18:49.760 --> 18:50.909
Where are you headed?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.719
We are going to, uh, to my brother's.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.196
Another game night?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.709
No. No, absolutely not.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.472
We're going to, um,

19:01.400 --> 19:02.435
have some dinner.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.635
Eat.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.193
I see.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.229
Pity. I was going to invite you
over for a dinner I'm hosting.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.913
I've purchased four lamb shanks

19:13.080 --> 19:17.915
that I've been simmering
in a broth of red wine and rosemary.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.952
That sounds so yummy, though.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.040
Damn it.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.315
It was actually Debbie's recipe.

19:24.800 --> 19:30.636
I like to think she left behind her
recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,

19:32.560 --> 19:36.030
but it was most likely
an unintentional oversight.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.238
Well, here we go.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.874
GARY: What?

19:47.960 --> 19:49.154
I'm sorry?

19:50.240 --> 19:52.037
I thought you said something.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.117
- No.
- Nope, not us.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.595
Okay.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.158
- (CAR ENGINE STARTS)
- Have fun.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.238
MAX: Oh, fuck me.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.957
A guy who rents a house this big

20:08.120 --> 20:11.237
must be making up for something
pretty small, I'd say.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.789
No, no. No, I've seen his dick.
It's pretty great.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.757
Well, I tried.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.474
- Hey!
- MAX: Hey!

20:18.640 --> 20:19.896
- ANNIE: Hey!
- How are you doing, beautiful?

20:19.920 --> 20:22.354
- Good, good. Really fancy.
- Very nice house, Tony Stark.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.600
Should we give
our drink orders to Jarvis? (CHUCKLES)

20:25.040 --> 20:27.793
No, I got the Tony Stark part,
but then you went full nerd on me.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.536
I kind of lost you,
but please do come in.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
All right.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.709
- Thanks, Cap.
- Hi, guys!

20:31.800 --> 20:32.800
ALL: What's up?

20:32.880 --> 20:36.350
Boy, could sleep four
on that couch. Look at that.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.158
Oh, hello, friends.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.835
Hey, let me introduce you to my date.
This is Sarah.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.991
Sarah is head of company accounting
at our office.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.400
Well, corporate communications.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.392
And she's also British,
which means she's smart as shit.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.272
- I'm Irish.
- Okay? Same island.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.555
Well, it's really not.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.776
- Nice to meet you. Hi.
- Nice to meet you, too.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.915
- I'm Max.
- Annie.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.992
So, you can't always judge a book
by its past covers, can you?

20:57.160 --> 20:59.196
- ANNIE: Mmm.
- Almost a saying.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.520
- Here you go.
- Hey, Brooks.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.136
- Cheers.
- We didn't know if you had any games,

21:02.160 --> 21:04.390
so we thought we'd bring you
a few of our favorites.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.073
Hey, look at that.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.112
- (CLATTERS)
- ALL: Whoa!

21:08.200 --> 21:09.560
MAX: Huh.
MICHELLE: The poor games.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.511
I told you we're taking it up a notch.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.638
The game that we're
gonna play tonight is so epic

21:14.800 --> 21:17.155
that we don't need a board,
and we do not need pieces.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.016
Still didn't need to throw them
across the room.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.268
I was being theatrical.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.192
Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?

21:22.360 --> 21:23.395
A what?

21:23.480 --> 21:25.496
It's when rich people
pay poor people to fight each other...

21:25.520 --> 21:28.016
Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.
Stop with the fight club, okay?

21:28.040 --> 21:29.314
- It's nonsense.
- No.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.879
Ryan believes everything he reads.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.553
Thank you.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.995
So, what are we playing?

21:37.520 --> 21:42.150
In the next hour, someone in this room
is going to be taken.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.318
And it's gonna be up to you to find them
before they are murdered.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.436
Oh! It's a murder mystery party.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.352
BROOKS: Not just any murder mystery.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.056
I found this company.
They do it super real.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.149
They use legit actors.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.312
You're not gonna know
what's real and what's fake.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.675
- Fun!
- But that's not all

21:57.840 --> 22:01.992
because whoever finds the victim
wins the grand prize.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.392
The keys to the Stingray.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.152
- What?
- Wow.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.958
Just the keys?

22:09.640 --> 22:11.073
No, Ryan, the whole car.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.356
Oh, yes! Oh, man!

22:13.560 --> 22:15.176
You're so lucky I brought you
to this game night

22:15.200 --> 22:17.270
- and not one of Max and Annie's.
- Hey!

22:17.480 --> 22:20.040
- No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.
- Oh.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.515
You're not gonna actually
give away your car?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.113
Oh, it's just a tax write-off.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.629
And the Audi, it's more practical.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.513
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.750
Okay. How do we start?

22:30.920 --> 22:32.672
We just wait for it to begin.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.354
Maybe play a drinking game
to pass the time?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.476
This group does not play drinking games.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.676
Tonight we do, Max.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.136
- Oh! "Never Have I Ever."
- RYAN: Good one!

22:42.160 --> 22:43.560
(QUIETLY) Can you believe this guy?

22:43.600 --> 22:45.511
(QUIETLY) Yeah, he's ridiculous.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.159
Beautiful house, though.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.912
Good champagne.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.672
Here we go.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.355
Yup. We're at the house.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.234
We'll let you know when we have him.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.799
(CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)

23:16.880 --> 23:18.711
(GASPS) Jesus Christ!

23:18.880 --> 23:20.598
What's with that knife?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.392
It's for the cheese.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.120
Okay, all right. Just, you know,

23:25.280 --> 23:27.589
really aggressive way to carry a knife.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.440
Oh, no, I've got one.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.115
Never have I ever
connected my work computer

23:33.280 --> 23:36.670
to the projector in the conference room
when it was open on a WebMD page

23:36.840 --> 23:37.909
for chlamydia symptoms.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.115
RYAN: That's not cool!

23:39.280 --> 23:40.395
SARAH: Drink!

23:40.560 --> 23:42.437
Just for the record,
I did not have chlamydia.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.433
It was pubic dermatitis. You get it
from not washing your crotch, so...

23:45.600 --> 23:46.776
ANNIE: Okay.
MAX: Good for you.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.870
I... I like her.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.296
And, listen, you're not supposed
to single people out in this game.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.470
It's supposed to be generic things, like

23:53.640 --> 23:55.392
"Never have I ever slept
with a celebrity."

23:55.560 --> 23:57.391
Oh, I didn't know. Okay.

23:57.480 --> 23:58.595
BROOKS: Whoops.

23:58.680 --> 23:59.749
- SARAH: Mmm?
- Ooh.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.114
(KEVIN CHUCKLES)

24:02.960 --> 24:03.995
What?

24:04.080 --> 24:05.877
You slept with a celebrity?

24:06.040 --> 24:08.634
No, I was taking a drink
separate from the game.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.856
- That was bad timing.
- MAX: Mmm.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.480
I see how you would think, but it's not.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.361
Well, then why are you breathing
like you just got off the elliptical?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.472
I'm not. I'm...

24:16.920 --> 24:19.195
(SCOFFS) Come on, babe.
Whose turn is it?

24:19.320 --> 24:21.629
Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?

24:21.800 --> 24:23.677
I'm not playing a drinking game.
Who was it?

24:23.840 --> 24:24.880
What's the deal with that?

24:24.920 --> 24:26.096
They've been together
since middle school.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.176
MICHELLE: It's somebody else's turn.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.200
- Oh. Oh!
- Yeah!

24:28.320 --> 24:30.336
How could you possibly
have had sex with a celebrity

24:30.360 --> 24:32.237
when we've only had sex with each other?

24:32.400 --> 24:34.656
Please, can you not make this
one of your things right now?

24:34.680 --> 24:35.840
How is this one of my things?

24:36.640 --> 24:39.518
Yeah, Brooks, this is why
we don't play drinking games.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

24:42.640 --> 24:44.392
It looks like the game is afoot.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.754
Oh!

24:45.880 --> 24:47.359
- Thank you, God!
- (SCOFFS)

24:47.520 --> 24:49.476
MAX: Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?

24:51.680 --> 24:53.193
Brooks Davis?

24:53.480 --> 24:54.515
Yes.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.192
- Oh, shit.
- ALL: Ooh!

24:56.360 --> 24:57.793
This is good.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.311
Agent Henderson.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.155
FBI.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.039
Sunglasses at night. It's legit.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.269
Sit down, please.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.033
I'll get right to the point.

25:09.200 --> 25:13.955
The Bureau has been tracking a ring
of violent kidnappers

25:14.120 --> 25:16.236
in this very neighborhood.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.316
And we have reason to believe
that one of you

25:21.600 --> 25:23.113
may be their next victim.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.428
(RYAN LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)

25:25.120 --> 25:26.336
- (CHUCKLES)
- MAX: That's terrible news.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.636
Contained within these dossiers

25:29.840 --> 25:33.435
are the clues you will require
to find the kidnappers.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.556
You'd like for us to do that, yeah?

25:36.120 --> 25:38.040
The Bureau's...
What's the Bureau's role in this?

25:38.120 --> 25:40.016
Maybe you guys could take my wife
in for questioning

25:40.040 --> 25:41.776
because, apparently, she got a
secret life I don't know nothing about.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.075
- Baby, this is...
- Shut up, all of you!

25:44.160 --> 25:45.309
Wow.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.598
It's not a joke.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.479
You people are in real danger,
and you're running out of time.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.394
And I, Agent Henderson,
will not stand idly by

25:55.560 --> 25:59.678
while innocent civilians
are slaughtered on my watch.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.096
(LAUGHING) I told you
this is gonna be great.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.951
- It's so good!
- So good.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.296
But, uh, before we get started,

26:04.320 --> 26:06.601
I'm required to ask if any of you
have any food allergies.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.075
Peanuts?

26:09.080 --> 26:10.229
Who the hell are you?

26:10.320 --> 26:11.389
- (GROANS)
- Oh!

26:11.480 --> 26:13.216
Now wait a second.
I know you're method and all,

26:13.240 --> 26:15.536
but you can't just come in here
and break the door. (GROANS)

26:15.560 --> 26:17.596
- (GUESTS EXCLAIM)
- I do not mind this game.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.358
- Are you crazy?
- (GRUNTS)

26:20.800 --> 26:23.109
(BOTH GRUNTING)

26:34.360 --> 26:36.112
It's very well done.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.549
No!

26:39.240 --> 26:40.832
That is a strong table.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.433
Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!

26:43.600 --> 26:44.635
Hell no!

26:46.560 --> 26:48.596
(GRUNTING CONTINUES)

with a celebrity?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.035

that we wouldn't hook up
with anybody else during that break.

and got a hand job from Karen Waller.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.710
that this is some game
where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?

what the last few charges I made were.

of the murder mystery place he used,

pay them off to give us the final clue.

we used to spend with them?

never had one of these,

35:00.160 --> 35:02.390
but that is a tasty drink.
It's kind of tart.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.391
You wanna try it? Oh! Honey!

35:04.560 --> 35:05.754

Oh! No! I think he made us.

So what? It's over.
What, are they gonna try to stop us?

35:15.160 --> 35:16.479
- Let's go.
- Yeah, probably.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.518
But that's why I brought this.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.336

Where did you get a gun?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.590
No, no, that's the fake gun
from Brooks' fight.

- Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.
- Yeah, well, you know...

- Brooks never spares any expense.
- Look at that.

- Yeah, that's true.
- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?

Brooks, what the fuck
is going on with you? Start talking!

45:19.400 --> 45:21.834
I've lied to you
and the family about what I do.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.878
I buy and I sell illegal shit for people
in the black market.

45:24.960 --> 45:26.234
Really? So you're a criminal?

45:26.320 --> 45:27.640
Oh, my God! They're following us!

45:29.320 --> 45:30.656
But I made a mistake,
because there's this guy.

45:30.680 --> 45:31.736
They call him the Bulgarian.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.069
He's got his fingers in all these pies
around the world.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.231
- What kind of pies?
- Illegal pies, Max.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.136
You know, the kind of pies that have
heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.216
You know, all that kind of stuff.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.993
But he just wanted me to help him
find this Fabergé egg.

45:43.080 --> 45:45.435
Fuck that! Fabergé egg?

45:45.520 --> 45:47.056
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.080
And I found it!

45:48.160 --> 45:50.799
But then there was this other guy,
this Marlon Freeman.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.950
He's willing to pay twice as much
for the same egg.

45:53.040 --> 45:54.576
So what? So you screwed over
the Bulgarian guy

45:54.600 --> 45:55.936
and those fellows behind us
work for him,

45:55.960 --> 45:57.776
and they just happen to crash your
murder mystery party?

What are the odds of that?

- We need to go to the cops now!
- Yeah, right now! Let's go!

46:15.160 --> 46:16.376
- We can't go to the cops!
- MAX: Why?

46:16.400 --> 46:17.800
The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.

I'll be dead before I get to jail.

Why don't we just get a hold
of this Marlon Freeman guy

46:50.680 --> 46:51.816

52:36.960 --> 52:39.349
Honey, I think you sewed my arm
to my sleeve.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.616
I didn't even know
Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.437
Aren't those worth millions of dollars?

52:43.520 --> 52:45.476
It's Marlon Freeman,
but that's just an alias.

52:45.560 --> 52:47.696
Somehow, we gotta find out
his real name, find out his address.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.870
- Police computer.
- MAX: What do you mean?

52:49.960 --> 52:52.030
I once dated this girl
whose father was a cop.

52:52.120 --> 52:54.076
She showed me her dad's police computer.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.958
It has a database with
every known alias on it.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.679
I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'
real name on it.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.376
So, if we called her up, would she
let you go on her dad's computer?

53:02.400 --> 53:04.709
No. No. No way! That ended badly.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.840
So how are we gonna get into a police
computer without the cops knowing?

53:07.880 --> 53:09.256
- Billy Bob Thornton!
- MICHELLE: What?

53:09.280 --> 53:11.316
- What?
- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?

53:11.400 --> 53:15.757
Hang on. Hang on. I know
where we can get on a police computer.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.110
- Hey!
- ALL: Gary!

53:19.480 --> 53:20.799
Goodness.

53:21.480 --> 53:23.436
To what do
Bastian and I owe the pleasure?

53:23.600 --> 53:24.999
Well, we were all just talking,

53:25.160 --> 53:27.913
and we realized
we haven't had a game night in ages,

53:28.080 --> 53:29.638
just the seven of us.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
So...

53:30.800 --> 53:32.756
I thought you were going
to your brother's house.

53:32.840 --> 53:33.989
I never said that.

53:34.080 --> 53:36.196
Come on, Gare Bear.
Live a little! It's the weekend!

53:36.280 --> 53:39.397
We were just saying how you were always
better at games than Debbie was.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.675
I'll thank you
not to besmirch my ex-wife.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.599
That woman is an angel.

53:43.680 --> 53:47.912
Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games
than you.

53:48.480 --> 53:54.476
I will admit I have eagerly awaited
a visit such as this.

54:00.560 --> 54:01.834
Where'd he go?

54:02.480 --> 54:03.993
Do we follow him?

54:04.080 --> 54:05.274
MAX: It seems like it.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.998
- Ryan, you go first.
- I'm scared.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.228
Help yourself to popped corn
with sea salt.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.151
Oh! Oh!

54:19.040 --> 54:20.519
(GROANS) Yummy, yummy.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.634
I can't believe that you read my mind.
I was craving popcorn.

54:23.800 --> 54:26.109
You have a framed photo of game night?

54:26.320 --> 54:30.108
Doesn't everyone have photographs
of their best friends in their homes?

54:31.600 --> 54:33.955
ANNIE: Of course. We do.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.312
Max, uh, you wanna go first?

54:36.400 --> 54:38.277
Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.

54:38.920 --> 54:40.114
Oh. There's a loose one.

54:40.200 --> 54:42.589
Always in the middle.
That's where you wanna go.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.079
Can I use your john real quick?

54:44.160 --> 54:46.549
Of course.
It's the end of the hall, next to our...

54:47.760 --> 54:49.955
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

54:50.120 --> 54:51.838
My bedroom.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.355
Okay.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.552
Oh, no, Gary.

55:46.200 --> 55:49.715
So, Sarah, how long have you two
been a couple?

55:50.560 --> 55:53.028
Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...

55:53.160 --> 55:56.277
We work together. I wouldn't, um...
I wouldn't do that thing.

55:56.360 --> 56:01.832
I see. I thought I detected a certain
chemistry between the two of you.

56:01.960 --> 56:04.520
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
- No. No way.

56:05.160 --> 56:07.310
- No, that's not...
- Mmm. Mmm.

56:07.640 --> 56:11.269
Then again, I'm not the best judge
of chemistry in the world. (CHUCKLES)

56:11.800 --> 56:13.313
(ALL CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)

56:19.240 --> 56:20.389
Hmm.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.672
Oh, because your wife left you.

56:23.240 --> 56:24.468
KEVIN: Oh, shit.

56:34.200 --> 56:36.350
Hello, Donald Anderton.

So many possible moves.
I just don't know where to begin.

Um, maybe... Ooh...

56:57.440 --> 56:59.056
- Decision-making.
- Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.

56:59.080 --> 57:00.638
- No!
- Please! No?

57:02.880 --> 57:05.792
Yup, take your time.

(SNIFFING)

57:37.880 --> 57:40.678
Oh, Brooks. What have you
gotten yourself into?

57:57.960 --> 58:02.033
Oh, shit. Where did you
come from, little guy?

58:03.400 --> 58:07.279
Son of a bitch.
Hey! What are you, a vampire?

58:07.520 --> 58:10.159
Oh, God. Oh, God.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.396
Oh, my God. Has that got it?

58:16.560 --> 58:20.439
No, that doesn't got it.
God damn it. Come on!

58:24.960 --> 58:25.960
No!

58:27.840 --> 58:28.840
I should go check on him.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.320
- (ALL EXCLAIM)
- I think he's fine.

58:30.560 --> 58:33.552
- He cried out.
- SARAH: Tell me about Debbie.

58:36.400 --> 58:37.628
I beg your pardon.

58:38.360 --> 58:42.831
Oh, just I... I never met her.
I'd love to hear all about her.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.233
Where do I begin?

58:55.400 --> 58:57.994
All right, you wanna take a bath?
We'll take a little bath.

58:58.160 --> 59:02.950
There we go. Okay.
All right. Here we go.

59:05.200 --> 59:08.033
There we go, huh? Huh?

59:09.520 --> 59:10.714
Oh, it's so much worse.

59:11.400 --> 59:14.836
Oh, God. And what did I do to this?
What the fuck is this thing?

59:16.360 --> 59:17.475
Oh, Debbie.

59:17.560 --> 59:18.754
Oh!

59:26.320 --> 59:28.754
Okay. Fuck this.

59:29.360 --> 59:31.191
Hey, guys, Gary was right.
It's awful late.

59:31.280 --> 59:33.589
Let's get home, get to bed, huh?
Get out of his hair.

59:33.680 --> 59:35.875
We haven't finished the game.
It's your turn, Max.

59:36.040 --> 59:37.268
Oh, my turn, huh?

59:37.440 --> 59:39.954
Okay, be careful now, Max.
Oh! (GROANS)

- Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.

out of Donald Anderton's house?

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.438

Um...

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.473
Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.776
and we're actually
on our way there right now.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.536
We can do a swap, okay?
Please don't hurt Brooks.

at midnight. If you're late, he dies.

Hello?

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.871
What's up with this guy's voice?
He sounds like a monster.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.792
He's using a voice changer, Ryan.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.189
He still sounds like a scary monster.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.274
KEVIN: And we are here.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.936
All right. You guys head home,

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.296
and I will call as soon
as I get the egg, all right?

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.470
What? Wait a second. Wait.
I'm going with you.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.696
No, Annie. It could be very, very
dangerous in there, okay?

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.001
Listen, Brooks shouldn't have
dragged any of us into this,

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.776
but he is my brother,
and it's up to me to fix it.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.870
No, bullshit!
We're all in this together!

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.076
No, no, no. Max is right.
You guys should go home,

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.435
but you and I are doing this.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.955
Okay, what happens
if you guys don't make it out?

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.376
We don't come to game night because
we're dying to play charades and shit.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.720
We come because we love you guys.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.876
Honestly, this is
the best part of our week.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.111

a lot of options on the weekend.

Aw, good friends.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.831
You should probably go, though, right?
I mean, you don't even know us.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.798
Yeah, why are you still here?

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.236
Oh, I don't know.
I just got caught up in it.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.311
Also, if I go home now,

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.216
and then I read in the newspaper
tomorrow that you all died,

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.199
I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,
so I'm gonna stick around.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.996
You still read the newspaper?

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.957
That's what you got from that?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.031
How are we gonna get into this place?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.713
Okay, I think we should split up.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.120
Yeah. And let's start upstairs.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.120
Anybody finds the egg,
just text the others, okay?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.016
And for God's sake, be careful with it.
All right?

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040
Got you. I got it.

What are you doing?

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.154
Who says the egg isn't in here?

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.958
Also, I have a really good feeling
about Logan.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.351
Egg, egg, egg.
Wow! This is some bedroom.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.176
Does it remind you
of your celebrity boyfriend's?

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.349
Are you still on this?

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.040
Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.
That's all I can think about.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.189
And that's saying a lot,

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.397
considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club
going on downstairs.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.352
Why is this so important to you?

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.109
Because, Michelle, look,
I am losing my mind here. Okay?

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.679
We were broken up at the time.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.150
I got a hand job from Karen Waller,
so you had every right to.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.634
So why not just tell me?

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.756
Okay, fine.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.999
It was 10 years ago.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.909
I was at a gas station,
and I noticed a guy at the next pump.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.230
It was Denzel Washington.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.708
Hold up.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.310
It actually was Denzel?

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.469
Yeah.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.392
He was really nice.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.268
He made some joke about how premium gas
is probably the same as regular.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.954
I took a chance, and I asked him
if he wanted to get drinks.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.268
He said yes.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.433
We both got a little tipsy.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.272
I offered to pay for drinks,
and he let me,

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.879
which I thought was pretty cool.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.709
We danced for hours.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.080
Eventually, we ended up
back at his place,

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.072
and one thing led to another.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.952
It was just
this crazy thing that happened,

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.712
and, in a weird way, it made me realize

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.236
the only person
I ever wanna be with is you.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080
Nah.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.039
Nah. I don't believe it.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.958
- Oh, you...
- Mmm-mmm. (CHUCKLES)

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.917
Well, I took a picture with him
at the club.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.832
I put it in a hidden folder.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.035

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.319
Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.828
Yeah, it is.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.149
Mmm. No, it's not.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.635

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.469
but, uh, it's not him.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.835
You're crazy. That's...
Look at that, that's Denzel.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.040
Okay, let me ask you this.
Did he say he was Denzel?

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.519
Well, no.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.079
He tried to introduce himself,
and I cut him off

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.469
because I told him I knew who he was.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.110
- What kind of car did he drive?
- A BMW.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.428
- Hmm.
- Three series.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.239
Mmm. What was his place like?

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.395
It... It was a two-bedroom condo.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.797
And he used the, um, spare room
as an office, so...

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.920

what you're saying right now?

Listen.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.151
I wanna have a baby,
but how do I explain this? Um...

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.040
Do you remember how we used to play
Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.216
and we could play all night?

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.496
Do you remember, this one time,
I made it all the way up to level 86,

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.896
- and you were not too far behind, right?
- Eighty-five, but...

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.400
And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.320
- So anyway, what is the point?
- Mmm... Anyway,

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.271
do you remember
how we stayed alive so long?

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.271
All we did was we ate the pellets.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.079
We never ate the fruit
because the fruit is how they get you.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.273
Oh, you're doing a metaphor!

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.839
Yes, but here's the problem.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.388
No matter how long you and I
stayed alive in the game,

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.600
neither one of us ever made it
up to the leader board.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.751
And you think if we have a baby,

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.239
we'll be officially settling down,

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.709
and you'll never make it
onto the leader board of life?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.392
That's such a good metaphor.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.755
Yeah, no, it's not.
It's kind of bullshit.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Why?

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.152

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.712
Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.553
I'm not the carefree dude
that wins at everything he touches.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.074
You know how I win?
I cheat. I cheat at everything.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.276
I even cheated when we were kids
playing Battleship.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.228
What?

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.790
Didn't you ever wonder why I made you
sit with your back to the TV?

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.678
It was so I could see your ships
in the reflection.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.275
I mean, I even took five grand
every time we played Monopoly

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.960
before we even started playing the game.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.430
I cheated at the Game of Life.
And at the game of life.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.919
You son of a bitch.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.195
- You son of a bitch!
- VAL: Sit down.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.296
- What about you, Princess?
- I don't have anything.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.756
But it didn't stop there
because, when we grew up, Max,

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.115
you went off to college, and I...

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.236
You got a career.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.034
You married the greatest girl
in the world.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.031
I knew I couldn't keep up
with that success.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.077
So I...

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.396
I told everyone that I got a job
on Wall Street.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.959
And I did.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.913
Selling coke to traders.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.429
You didn't invest in Panera?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.999
I ate at Panera.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.718
Jesus Christ.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.597
VAL: What's going on?

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.536
But that's why I've been trying
to make it up to you.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.936
That's what this whole game night
was about.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.952
See, I had it rigged
so that you'd finally win.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.912
The last clue was gonna lead you...

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.319
Your jacket pocket.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.513
ANNIE: Huh.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.672
Surprise! (CHUCKLES)

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.838
I even managed to fuck that up, though.
I'm so sorry.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.911
I'm so sorry, Max. (SIGHS)

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:08.776
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.950
I think we're gonna be okay, though.
I got a feeling.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.234
You want us to kill them all?

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.355
What?

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.096
- Okay.
- ANNIE: Wait, wait. Just let us go.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.296
We won't tell anyone anything.

- Oh, shit. The fuzz.
- Fuck, man!

Don't even think about it, pig.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.400
Can't say I care for that nomenclature.

- You all right?

Fine, thank you,

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.589
though, in sliding, my belt buckle
may have inadvertently scratched

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.238
the finish of my squad car.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.912

- A blood capsule?

you do a game night. (CHUCKLES)

I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.776
When I learned you stopped inviting me
to your game nights,

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.598
I hijacked
Brooks's murder mystery party,

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.511
and I staged a kidnapping of my own.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.079
You gotta be kidding me.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.357

as a game night participant?

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.476

Are they actors?

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.516

of their parole

for this little side project.

Hey, what the hell kind of psycho
are you?

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.994
You put us through all this,
just for your own amusement?

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.436
No, no. Just the opposite.
For your amusement.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.669
Did everyone have fun?

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.438

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.158

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.960
I don't see how that's possible.
My men were using blanks.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.996
Well, that was my gun.
It was a real gun.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.753
So, this whole thing, the Fabergé egg,

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.109

at the big twist here?

you introduce at the last minute.

No.

One of us has to be the asshole
in this transaction

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.674
because otherwise I'd have my egg,
and you'd have your money.

But instead, we've wasted our night
tracking you down.

- What?

Hi, I'm Max. (STAMMERS)
I'm Brooks's brother.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.310

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.656
- Right? You got greedy.
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.715
He admits it.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.677
Good news is, though,
that we got your egg.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.515
It is broken. Uh, my screw up.

Deal. Makes perfect sense.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.875
Uh, Boys Don't Cry?

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.871
Is that a tear? No, is that the actor?

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.376
- Mr. Potato Head.
- Are you drawing the actor?

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.469
- Cry-Baby?
- Yes!

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.669
Time!

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.637
- It was The Green Mile.
- ALL: What?

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.278
How is that The Green Mile?

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.314
This is me at the Regal Cinema crying

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.908
as I did through much of the film.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.600
How were we supposed to know that, Gary?

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:57.837
I assume everyone cried
during The Green Mile.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:31:59.800
So, who's next?

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:00.880
I'll go.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.279
- Yeah!
- MAX: Go, baby!

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.496
ALL: Yeah!
MICHELLE: Nice try, Gary.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.033
And go!

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.635
ANNIE: Uh...

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.376
MAX: It's a rock.
MICHELLE: A bean? A rock!

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.674
- A ball?
- KEVIN: That's a...

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.176
- Burger. Is that a burger?
- RYAN: Football! Football!

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.776
MAX: No, oh,
that's a dinner roll, right?

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:13.994
- A bun!
- MICHELLE: Bread?

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.877
Is it a bun? Looks like a bun.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.960
SARAH: French loaf?

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.216
- Is this a motion picture?
- MAX: Bun is in a house. On a train.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.456
GARY: Aren't you supposed
to announce it?

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.336
SARAH: Microwave?
MAX: It's being cooked. It's in an oven.

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.896
- Bun in the oven!
- SARAH: Yes, yes, yes!

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.798
- (KEVIN LAUGHS)
- Wait. What?

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.633
Yes.

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.829
You pregnant?

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.399
We did it.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.795
RYAN: Oh, my gosh!
They're having a baby!

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.518
They're having a baby!

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.195
(ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:35.394
How you doing?

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.391
- WOMAN: Hi.
- I'm Kenny.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:39.072
Nice to meet you, Kenny.

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:40.235
(CHUCKLES)

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.232
Usually people cut me off
and say they know who I am.

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.437
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I didn't catch your name.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.793
I'm Debbie.
