00:00.959 --> 00:02.544
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.836 --> 00:05.046
Your mother works for us.

00:05.213 --> 00:06.339
Your mother is alive.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.133
You know, I'm thinking
more and more that this

00:08.216 --> 00:09.968
is an inside job.
Why?

00:10.051 --> 00:11.386
The hardware
he brought to the meet.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.888
He could read Scylla
right on the spot.

00:16.766 --> 00:17.976
Hands on your head.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.687
-Punch it! We got to get out of here!
-No, stop!

00:20.770 --> 00:22.313
Michael, get in!

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
Sorry, but right now
I want my life back

00:27.110 --> 00:28.069
more than I want your money.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.195
Where's Scylla?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.864
Let's talk about
that, okay?

00:30.947 --> 00:31.865
Let's. Where is it?

00:31.948 --> 00:32.866
I can get it.

00:32.949 --> 00:33.867
No, he can't.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.827
He's stalling, Linc.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.287
-It's gone.
-You're right.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.916
You have no idea
who this guy's working for?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.460
No. No clue.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.464
Your boy's dead.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.466
And now
I'm coming after you.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.053
Who was that?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.888
That was my son.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.515
Lincoln.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.736
What is this?

01:11.196 --> 01:13.031
I don't know...

01:13.114 --> 01:14.532
Just found them
on the doorstep.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.745
Son of a...

01:22.499 --> 01:25.710
They lay one hand on my mama,
and I swear on my life...

01:27.045 --> 01:28.213
She's in a state home.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.048
I thought we were working
with these people.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.341
So did I.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.512
I'm gonna make a call
and find out what's going on.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.645
Mr. Burrows.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.729
We had a deal.

01:44.854 --> 01:48.024
Our deal is contingent
upon the retrieval of Scylla.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.152
Based on the mediocrity
of your performance

01:51.236 --> 01:52.612
on that front thus far,

01:53.279 --> 01:55.865
I thought it best to make sure
you're all properly motivated.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.244
Just tell me how your team
is progressing.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.538
I swear to God, man, when I,
when I get a hold of you...

02:01.663 --> 02:02.580
If I were you,

02:02.664 --> 02:04.249
I'd be doing
everything in my power

02:04.332 --> 02:06.501
to demonstrate
my competence right now.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.505
We killed the guy
who came to Miami.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.757
We found some keys on him.

02:12.841 --> 02:13.967
We're looking into them.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.094
Are we done?

02:16.177 --> 02:17.220
Not quite.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.346
A new competitor

02:18.429 --> 02:19.597
has joined the search.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.099
We're the ones
getting Scylla.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.433
Well, that's good to hear,

02:22.517 --> 02:25.854
because the competing party,
is your brother Michael.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.524
Michael's with you.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.444
Michael's getting treatment
with you.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.696
Apparently Michael's

02:34.779 --> 02:37.866
a little more headstrong
than either of us imagined.

02:37.949 --> 02:38.950
But don't worry.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.286
We have a lead on him
somewhere in central Arizona.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.454
Mr. Oren is waiting
in his limousine.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.083
If you speak to Michael,

02:47.167 --> 02:49.127
tell him to find
a very good hiding place.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.504
Because if any
of my men spot him,

02:51.588 --> 02:53.464
they've been given
a green light.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.222
2,500 miles to go.

03:01.806 --> 03:02.807
If we take turns sleeping

03:02.891 --> 03:04.225
we can be there
by tomorrow night.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.561
Should we call Lincoln?
Let him know we're coming?

03:09.272 --> 03:10.607
Michael, he took
the Company's deal

03:10.690 --> 03:11.774
to save your life.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.528
And for what it's worth,
I might've done the same thing.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.572
Then you'd be wrong, too.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.880
You know, this promises to be
a really, really long ride.

03:33.963 --> 03:36.341
So, how about we just...

03:36.758 --> 03:38.927
call truce, all right?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.098
Forgot napkins.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.893
Get down!

04:25.014 --> 04:26.432
Come on.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.831
He comes anywhere
near my kid...

04:49.914 --> 04:50.915
You know, Don,

04:50.999 --> 04:54.210
you seem to be taking
this whole thing pretty well.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.545
Yeah, well,
I'm a pretty calm guy.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.171
All I'm saying is,

04:57.255 --> 04:58.548
my mama, his son, his wife.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.591
We don't even know
who they got on you.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.093
That's 'cause it's
none of your business.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.094
All right, all you
need to worry about

05:03.177 --> 05:04.262
is that I'm here
to do a job.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.513
Hold-Secure.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.557
The company that
manufactures the keys.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.392
It's called Hold-Secure.
Listen to this.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.477
Each key they produce is
implanted with a computer chip.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.687
That chip sends out
a unique

05:12.770 --> 05:14.439
electronic signal
that opens its lock.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.857
Something that high-tech,

05:15.940 --> 05:17.817
I'm telling you,
I'm betting they got a database

05:17.900 --> 05:19.485
that'll tell us exactly
where each key's

05:19.569 --> 05:21.279
corresponding lock
has been installed.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.448
Look at that.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.658
These keys run about
five hundred bucks each.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.618
You only spend that
kind of money if you're

05:27.702 --> 05:30.121
protecting something
of vital importance.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.998
Like Scylla.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.716
Someone just tried to access

05:41.799 --> 05:43.551
Carruth's account
at Hold-Secure.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.137
And what information
was compromised?

05:46.220 --> 05:47.430
We don't know yet.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.973
And who was
trying to access it?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.058
We don't know.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.351
Thank you for
bringing that

05:51.434 --> 05:52.935
to my attention. Good work.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.315
Yes?

05:57.398 --> 05:58.816
It's your son.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.986
We already have safeguards
in place to deal with Lincoln.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.613
I'm talking about Michael.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.282
He's escaped Company custody.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.659
He's coming
to Miami right now.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.790
Christina?

06:13.873 --> 06:17.418
If only they understood
what it is I'm trying to do.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.926
Thank you very much.

06:26.761 --> 06:27.720
Thanks.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.768
Okay, what now?

06:34.560 --> 06:35.603
We'll think of something.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.397
Michael, we can't
afford to buy a car

06:37.480 --> 06:38.940
and we can't fly.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.946
It's time to call
your brother.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.785
Got it.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.204
We've got the locations
of those two locks.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.372
One's in Little Havana.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.581
The other one's
down by the water.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.583
Perfect. Lincoln,
why don't you and I...

06:57.667 --> 07:00.044
You take Self and
go to Little Havana.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.295
We're gonna head south.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.588
Huh, that's a surprise.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.215
Bring your suntan lotion.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.258
Be right there.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.474
It's me.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.892
What's your problem?

07:14.976 --> 07:17.103
Look, I need you
to hear me out on this, Linc.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.646
Everything was all set up
and you blew it.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.898
You couldn't just
let me handle this, could you?

07:20.982 --> 07:23.359
If by "handle," you mean
give Scylla back to the General,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.236
then no, I couldn't.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.155
It's more complicated
than that.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.573
Actually, it's not.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.657
Listen...

07:29.740 --> 07:30.741
I want my life back

07:30.825 --> 07:32.410
and this is the only way
we can do that!

07:32.493 --> 07:34.120
I don't believe that's true.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.288
You know what, man?

07:35.371 --> 07:36.456
You need to grow up.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.083
Look, if that's how
you really feel, Linc,

07:39.167 --> 07:41.919
I should warn you I'm going
to do everything in my power

07:42.003 --> 07:43.504
to stop you.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.882
Listen to me: I had a deal
with the General.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.550
You blew it.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.927
If he finds you,
he's gonna kill you.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.554
Surprise, surprise.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.931
I did this for us, Michael.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.433
You, me, Sara,

07:55.516 --> 07:57.935
LJ, so you could
be with Sara.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.770
Two seconds,
think of your family.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.397
Feels like family's
the only thing

08:01.481 --> 08:03.316
I can think
about these days.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.067
What does that mean?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.819
Michael?

08:08.404 --> 08:09.989
Linc, Mom is alive.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.118
What?

08:14.202 --> 08:16.454
I guess I'll
see you in Miami.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.872
We gotta get out of here.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.752
Sir, you mind if I ask
where you're going?

08:22.835 --> 08:23.669
Dallas.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.046
Mind if we hitch a ride?

08:25.129 --> 08:27.590
I got a hundred bucks
gas money.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.050
Please?

08:30.635 --> 08:31.761
Sir?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.311
Cab's not big enough
for the two of you.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.437
If you want to
ride together

08:41.521 --> 08:43.022
you're going to have
to ride back here.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.566
Done.

08:57.745 --> 08:58.704
Get comfortable.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.414
It's gonna be eight hours
till we stop again.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.031
Hey, Linc...

09:34.115 --> 09:36.367
If Scylla really is in there,
there's gonna be security.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.952
I need you focused.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.634
Yeah.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.365
Hey, Linc, right there.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.555
All clear upstairs.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.350
You find something?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.684
Picture of my mom.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.646
Someone must have known
I was coming.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.401
Someone who's connected enough
to be working with Carruth

10:52.485 --> 10:54.028
and who knows you well enough

10:54.111 --> 10:56.155
to get their hands
on that picture.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.115
There's only one person I can think of

10:58.199 --> 10:59.533
that fits that description.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.078
You're saying
my mom's in Miami?

11:02.161 --> 11:03.704
If she was operating
out of this house,

11:03.788 --> 11:05.081
she certainly had
access to money.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.083
She's a Company agent.
Gretchen said she thought

11:07.166 --> 11:08.959
that this could be
an inside job.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.754
Linc...

11:12.254 --> 11:13.756
Your mother could have Scylla.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.726
She used to bake cookies when we'd
come home from school,

11:26.727 --> 11:29.939
play kickball with us
in the backyard.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.692
There's just no way
that woman was a Company agent.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.113
You did read her file,
didn't you?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.240
I saw medical reports

11:39.323 --> 11:42.451
that said she had the
same diagnosis I did

11:43.744 --> 11:44.954
and that Company
doctors operated

11:45.037 --> 11:46.622
on her, too.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.667
Now I'm wondering
if they took her off

11:49.750 --> 11:53.337
to a little cabin in the woods
after they were done,

11:53.421 --> 11:56.465
introduced her
to a friendly shrink.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.554
How else could someone
just stand by and watch

12:01.637 --> 12:04.682
while their own children were
hunted down like dogs? I...

12:06.726 --> 12:08.477
Maybe she didn't know.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.689
She knew.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.943
Maybe it was
over her head.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.528
Or maybe she didn't care.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.449
Anyway, I'm just surprised

12:21.532 --> 12:25.202
the General waited so long
to drop this bomb on us.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.913
Actually, I think
that part makes sense.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.582
I mean,
for whatever reason,

12:29.665 --> 12:31.751
your mother didn't want you
to know she was alive

12:31.834 --> 12:34.086
or you would have known
years ago, and...

12:34.170 --> 12:37.089
the General was just keeping
that secret, right?

12:37.173 --> 12:40.259
Keeping her happy,
keeping her working.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.012
But now the game
has changed.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.139
Yeah, now he thinks
you might be useful.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.559
Just like Mom.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.316
Beyond question, he possesses
the most gifted mind

12:55.399 --> 12:57.777
of any man
I've ever encountered.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.862
Well, I'll try not to
take that too personally.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.950
He drilled
into your office safe

13:05.034 --> 13:08.913
and copied your card
without you even noticing.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.166
As I recall, you were sitting
right next to me.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.085
If we could have turned
Michael Scofield,

13:15.169 --> 13:17.713
it would have been like having
thirty more years of Christina.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.217
Pull over.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.516
That's my ride.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.642
What's going on?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.727
Good-bye, Jonathan.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.271
This ain't the place.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.690
I could pick
that lock with my stump.

14:17.773 --> 14:21.569
No, n-no, n-no. Remember what they say
about books and their covers.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.362
All right, when Harry Winston
donated the Hope Diamond

14:23.445 --> 14:27.324
to the Smithsonian, you know how
he got it from New York to DC?

14:27.783 --> 14:29.201
Registered mail.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.203
It's the safest way to go.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.913
After all,
who is going to be looking

14:32.997 --> 14:36.208
for the Hope Diamond
at the post office, right?

14:36.292 --> 14:38.752
And who would be looking
for Scylla

14:38.836 --> 14:41.380
at some run-down storefront
church in Little Havana?

14:41.463 --> 14:42.923
All right, let's
say you're right.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.216
They got Scylla
back there somewhere.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.136
You walk in there,
reeking that cop stink,

14:47.219 --> 14:49.013
you won't last
a second.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.223
That's a good point.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.641
That's why you're going in.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.034
May I help you?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.036
Yes, as a matter of fact.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.121
I'm Charles Patoshik.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.582
I'm a professor
of anthropology

15:16.665 --> 15:18.250
at Southern Florida
University.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.128
I'm doing some various research
on various different kinds

15:21.211 --> 15:24.590
of, uh, uh, uh,
Caribbean religions, and, uh...

15:24.673 --> 15:25.591
perhaps you could start

15:25.674 --> 15:29.053
back there where you, you
do your, uh, services.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.014
That is our sanctuary.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.099
Only the pure of soul

15:34.183 --> 15:35.935
may venture
inside.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.311
I know.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.730
I-I have been
in many such rooms.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.315
Let me see your hand.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.873
Your soul is black,

15:57.957 --> 16:00.542
stained with the blood
of the innocent.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.420
I cannot let you pass.

16:03.504 --> 16:07.591
I have never been
so offended in my life.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.641
I suggest that you continue
your research

16:15.724 --> 16:16.976
elsewhere.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.364
If you drop something
by accident,

16:32.032 --> 16:33.534
you leave a
fingerprint on it.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.662
She wanted you
to find this.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.080
Why?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.665
You ever seen it before?

16:40.374 --> 16:41.417
No.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.085
Do you remember
anything about that day?

16:43.168 --> 16:44.336
I was four years old.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.172
Any idea where
it was taken?

16:47.256 --> 16:48.424
No.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.429
Hey.
You okay?

16:55.264 --> 16:57.558
-I mean, if I found out my mom was...
-Listen,

16:57.641 --> 16:59.518
as far as I'm concerned,
she's not my mom.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.562
She's just someone in the way of
my freedom, all right?

17:10.946 --> 17:12.865
So, on my sixth birthday,

17:12.948 --> 17:16.952
um, my father was
long gone by then,

17:17.036 --> 17:19.121
so it was just me and
Mom, and Linc, and...

17:19.204 --> 17:20.831
Mom hands me my present,

17:20.914 --> 17:24.877
my, uh, my only present,
and I just know...

17:24.960 --> 17:27.504
I just know it's the
Millennium Falcon.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.173
With the
battle alert sound?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.174
Exactly.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.217
I totally had that.
Of course you did.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.553
Anyway, I had been asking
for this thing for weeks,

17:34.636 --> 17:36.805
and the package is just
the right size, and...

17:36.889 --> 17:38.223
I rip open the
wrapping paper

17:38.307 --> 17:41.685
and... it's a birdhouse.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.853
Oh, no.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.731
Yeah, except
it's not even a birdhouse.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.691
It's actually a
birdhouse kit.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.943
I'm so sorry.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.654
I didn't talk to her
for two days after that,

17:53.655 --> 17:56.700
but when she finally got
me to open the thing,

17:56.784 --> 17:57.826
we sat there
together,

17:57.910 --> 18:00.454
put it together
piece by piece,

18:00.537 --> 18:02.122
and it was the first
thing I ever built.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.375
And I loved it...

18:07.169 --> 18:08.378
and she knew I would.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.715
She knew me better
than I knew myself.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.425
That's what moms do, right?

18:13.509 --> 18:17.596
Yeah, but the strange thing is...
even though I haven't seen

18:17.679 --> 18:21.141
her for twenty three years,
there's this part of me that...

18:21.225 --> 18:23.393
feels like maybe
she still does.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.140
Your truck looks
a little low to the ground.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.349
You mind
stepping outside?

19:02.432 --> 19:04.560
I just got weighed
twenty miles back.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.978
You highway patrol?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.442
Where you going?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.164
You got no
business in there.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.206
Unless you show me
a warrant,

19:26.290 --> 19:28.417
you get the hell out of
there right now.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.096
Thank you.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.435
Goodness.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.022
I got my weigh station ticket
right here on the dash.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.274
As soon as you see that...

19:53.275 --> 19:55.277
You'll see,
I got it right here.

19:57.821 --> 19:59.072
Here you go.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.536
I need you to follow me
back to Phoenix.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.871
Are you crazy?

20:05.954 --> 20:08.498
I got to get this load
to Dallas.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.625
Well, that's your choice.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.225
I got 'em.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.819
I think we need
to call your brother.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.948
No signal.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.699
We must be in the
middle of nowhere.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.743
Didn't Lincoln say that
if the Company caught you...

20:48.330 --> 20:50.499
I think I saw a side
door back here.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.918
What about the main door?

20:53.001 --> 20:54.127
You'll never get that open.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.796
I'm sure it's latched
from the outside.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.547
Can you open the side door?

20:57.631 --> 20:59.174
Maybe.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.475
Sara.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.477
Help me out.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.443
I don't think we're gonna
be able to move this.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.615
Maybe we won't have to.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.452
I have troubling news
about General Krantz.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.996
He's alive.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.914
I don't see
how that's possible.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.834
Yes, well, what I'm hearing is
a helicopter with a medic took off

21:33.917 --> 21:37.879
from Company headquarters
in Los Angeles one hour ago.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.090
It landed for two minutes
in Canyon Country

21:40.173 --> 21:42.259
and now it's back
in Los Angeles.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.593
So you got the corpse?

21:43.677 --> 21:46.972
The helicopter landed
back at Company headquarters.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.890
You know how important
getting rid of him is

21:48.974 --> 21:50.809
to what we're trying
to accomplish.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.562
All right,
I can still get this done.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.647
Not in our time frame.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.528
All right, I'm
pulling the plug.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.530
We need to start dealing
with the consequences.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.407
Wait, wait, wait.
First things first.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.908
He knows that
I've betrayed him.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.785
I need to disappear.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.579
I think that's
a good instinct.

22:10.954 --> 22:11.997
I have a house
in Sun Valley.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.082
I have another idea.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.918
Do you mind
putting me on speaker?

22:19.713 --> 22:22.716
You know, Griff,
you're a brave man.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.844
And I thank you
for everything you've done.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.179
It's been an honor.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.765
Now!

22:29.848 --> 22:31.016
"Now" what?

22:35.604 --> 22:37.522
The car in this picture,
it has Florida plates.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.982
Did you ever
vacation there?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.150
No.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.152
Do you know anyone from Florida
who came up to visit?

22:42.235 --> 22:43.779
No.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.198
Why did they take this picture
in front of that car?

22:49.785 --> 22:51.119
We didn't.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.246
It's been doctored.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.373
I'm not sure about that.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.208
I mean, the lighting,
the shadows,

22:56.291 --> 22:57.751
they all sync up perfectly.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.379
This is a '78 Zephyr.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.672
Michael was born in '76.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.843
You're the only one
who could've picked up on that.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.303
She doctored that for you.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.223
Let's see what else
she might've changed.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.183
What's the license plate
on that Zephyr?

23:13.266 --> 23:15.435
M-L-K 4-4-1.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.356
Martin Luther King Boulevard
intersects with Route 441

23:19.439 --> 23:20.899
about five miles
north of here.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.818
Good.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.694
You guys are here.
Listen, we're a little out-manned

23:24.778 --> 23:26.405
down in Little Havana.
We could use some backup.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.407
We got a lead
on the buyer.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.158
Great, what are
we waiting for?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.701
I think I'm going to do
this myself.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.745
No, no. Come on, let's stay together.
We're a team, right?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.038
I said I got it.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.249
After our little
special deliveries this morning,

23:37.332 --> 23:38.875
each of us has an equal stake.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.962
Now, whoever started this, we're
all going to take them out.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.801
The buyer, we think
it's Lincoln's mother.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.636
What?

23:49.719 --> 23:51.304
Like I said, I'm
doing this myself.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.598
Linc!

23:53.682 --> 23:55.475
If she has Scylla,

23:55.559 --> 23:57.144
she's not just going
to hand it over

23:57.227 --> 23:58.895
any more than the
General would have.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.397
You don't know that.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.898
We always thought
whoever had Scylla

24:01.982 --> 24:03.191
would do what
the General did.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.443
Maybe she won't.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.485
Are you serious?

24:05.569 --> 24:07.195
Your mother is
a Company agent?

24:08.071 --> 24:09.114
She was.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.615
She might be one
of the good guys now.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.784
With all due respect, I don't think
you're in a place where you can make

24:12.868 --> 24:14.536
a clear determination
about that.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.747
Listen, this MLK 441
could be nothing.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.041
But at the church,
there could be Scylla.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.336
If I need you, I'll call.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.799
This should work.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.159
Christina?

24:54.242 --> 24:55.952
You need to acknowledge
that our chance

24:56.036 --> 24:58.622
of success has substantially declined
in the last twenty four hours.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.165
There are people
out looking for us.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.375
We need to start thinking
in terms of contingencies.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.295
Just a little while longer,
only a few more days.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.005
General Krantz
refused to adjust

25:07.088 --> 25:08.548
when there were credible
threats against him.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.926
That's the reason
we have Scylla now.

25:12.135 --> 25:15.680
Are you honestly
comparing me to him?

25:17.265 --> 25:21.269
I understand what you think
your role is in all of this,

25:21.353 --> 25:22.979
and I appreciate
your efforts.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.606
But if you can't tell
the difference

25:24.689 --> 25:26.525
between he and I,
perhaps you need to ask

25:26.608 --> 25:29.110
the General
for your old job back.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.074
Oh, look.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.743
Here he is.
Would you like to take the call?

25:42.624 --> 25:43.542
Jonathan.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.168
Good afternoon, Christina.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.503
It's good to
hear your voice.

25:46.586 --> 25:49.172
I assume this means
you've retrieved Scylla.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.215
Not yet.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.259
Oh, that's troubling news.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.094
Have any idea where it is?

25:54.177 --> 25:55.345
Where are you, Christina?

25:56.179 --> 25:58.515
Johannesburg.
Where else would I be?

25:58.598 --> 25:59.891
I've had some of my contacts

25:59.975 --> 26:01.726
in your area
check out your house.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.228
There's no one home.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.605
Well, of course not.
As long as Scylla's in play,

26:05.689 --> 26:07.190
that address is blown.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.070
Where are you, Christina?

26:12.153 --> 26:14.447
I don't like your
tone, Jonathan.

26:14.531 --> 26:15.574
Excuse me

26:15.657 --> 26:17.909
if I sound a bit abrasive.

26:17.993 --> 26:21.246
But it's been a while since
anyone's tried to kill me.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.914
Oh, my God.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.208
Are you all right?
What happened?

26:25.292 --> 26:27.210
Oren.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.420
Oren?

26:28.503 --> 26:30.880
We found his body... executed.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.925
I can only assume that
he's working with someone.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.760
Someone who doesn't
tolerate failure.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.763
Now, where are you, Christina?

26:38.847 --> 26:40.140
You listen to me.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.101
If you're implying that I had
anything to do with this...

26:43.184 --> 26:44.728
Where are you?

26:44.811 --> 26:47.147
After everything
I've given the Company:

26:47.230 --> 26:49.024
my husband, my children...

26:49.107 --> 26:51.901
I think it's time
that we had a sit-down.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.154
A talk.
Tell you what.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.406
Why don't you gather up
the brain trust:

26:56.489 --> 26:59.993
that half-witted daughter
and your psychotic mistress?

27:00.076 --> 27:03.330
Why don't you get together
and figure out where Scylla is?

27:03.413 --> 27:04.956
Then call me.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.240
Mr. Burrows.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.667
May I escort you
to your table?

28:14.901 --> 28:16.653
You haven't changed a bit.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.579
I'm glad you
got my message.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.206
I know it wasn't
the most straightforward

28:28.289 --> 28:31.751
mode of communication,
but I had to be sure it was you.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.920
At least now I know
where Michael gets it from.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.343
I'm sure you have
a lot of questions.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.303
Where's Scylla?

28:43.346 --> 28:44.514
It's safe.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.974
That's all I can
tell you for right now.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.351
Then we've got
nothing to talk about.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.811
Really?

28:49.894 --> 28:51.896
That's the only reason
you came here?

28:53.356 --> 28:54.941
Yeah.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.152
I really would've thought
you wanted to know the truth.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.278
I know the truth.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.571
You work for the Company.

29:00.780 --> 29:02.824
The same people
that set me up for murder.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.659
Lincoln...
The same people

29:04.743 --> 29:06.286
that have been
trying to kill me and Michael

29:06.369 --> 29:08.079
ever since we
escaped Fox River.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.042
You can think it as much as
you want, I'm not a monster.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.966
Twenty three years
and not even an apology?

29:20.049 --> 29:22.761
If I thought an apology
would do any good,

29:22.844 --> 29:24.345
I would offer it.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.311
Please.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.772
Please sit down.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.785
Leaving you two boys...

29:46.868 --> 29:49.412
was the hardest thing
I ever did.

29:49.496 --> 29:50.955
But you did.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.500
And then you went off
and worked for the Company.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.462
You know, you think you know
what the Company is,

29:57.545 --> 29:58.838
but you don't.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.508
It's a body
that bends

30:01.591 --> 30:02.842
to the will of its head.

30:02.926 --> 30:06.638
And right now, it is
bloodthirsty and war-hungry,

30:06.721 --> 30:09.057
because that's who
General Krantz is.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.310
But what if a woman,

30:12.393 --> 30:15.980
a mother, ran it?

30:16.064 --> 30:18.608
Can you imagine
the difference that would make?

30:18.691 --> 30:20.109
You think you're a mother?

30:20.193 --> 30:22.028
A mother's priority

30:22.111 --> 30:23.988
is her family.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.740
If I give Scylla
back to the General, he leaves me

30:25.824 --> 30:27.659
and Michael alone,
and I get to spend time

30:27.742 --> 30:29.118
with my son in peace.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.790
Look, I could sit here for days
and try to explain to you

30:33.873 --> 30:35.875
why I did what I did.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.336
Suffice it to say,
I couldn't protect you then,

30:38.419 --> 30:41.047
but let me protect you now.

30:43.049 --> 30:46.135
What if General Krantz
were no longer in the picture?

30:46.803 --> 30:48.513
Once he was
dealt with,

30:48.596 --> 30:50.473
no one would
come after you.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.685
But I need time, Lincoln.

30:53.768 --> 30:55.019
I need two days

30:55.103 --> 30:56.688
to put everything
into place.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.773
If you give me
two days...

30:59.983 --> 31:02.318
then I can give you
and Michael

31:02.402 --> 31:03.862
your complete
and utter freedom.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.918
All right.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.545
I'm going to get started
right away.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.547
But if Krantz
suspects any of this,

31:22.630 --> 31:24.674
he's going to
hunt us both down.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.511
And for that reason,

31:28.595 --> 31:30.889
I can't risk
being seen with you

31:30.972 --> 31:32.807
until all of this is over.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.102
How do I get
in touch with you?

31:36.185 --> 31:37.312
You can't.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.023
I'm sorry.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.800
Once we pull this box down,

32:07.884 --> 32:09.344
it'll push
the water machine

32:09.427 --> 32:10.595
right through the side door.

32:10.678 --> 32:11.721
We're slowing down.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.056
I think we're getting
off the highway.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.140
I'm almost ready.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.103
Would you grab that
strap over there?

32:26.819 --> 32:28.488
All right, hold it.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.416
Come on!

32:57.725 --> 32:58.601
You all right?

33:20.581 --> 33:23.376
After you clear the area
I don't anticipate any problems.

33:23.459 --> 33:24.627
All right?

33:24.919 --> 33:26.170
Scylla or not, here we come.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.296
-All right.
-Hold on.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.423
Hold on.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.178
What the hell are
those guys doing?

33:36.681 --> 33:38.683
We're not going against any
additional people in there.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.101
We wait until they
come back out.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.269
All right.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.275
So Lincoln's mother
is really the buyer?

33:49.986 --> 33:51.154
It appears that way.

33:51.237 --> 33:52.196
I hope he
understands

33:52.280 --> 33:55.074
that if I need to take her
out to get to Scylla,

33:55.158 --> 33:57.035
I'm not going to hesitate
to kill her.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.286
No question.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.204
Well, let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.623
You serious?

34:02.707 --> 34:04.250
Yeah. Am I serious
if we can get Scylla

34:04.333 --> 34:05.710
without killing
Linc's mother?

34:05.793 --> 34:07.503
That's the preferable outcome.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.005
Wait a second.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.506
If I'm gonna be in a
foxhole with you,

34:10.590 --> 34:12.175
I need to know that
you have my back.

34:17.555 --> 34:19.182
Mrs. Burrows
has the item,

34:19.390 --> 34:21.017
and the only way to get it
is to kill her.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.477
What is your move?

34:26.189 --> 34:27.940
I pull the trigger.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.532
There they go.
Come on.

34:47.919 --> 34:51.130
Don Self, Homeland Security.

34:51.881 --> 34:54.592
We're investigating
a cruelty to animal charge.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.221
I have no idea what
you're referring to.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.431
We're referring to ritual
slaughters of chickens.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.475
Okay, that might be allowed
where you come from,

35:02.558 --> 35:04.477
but here in America,
that's.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.561
Chickens?

35:05.728 --> 35:07.271
This is preposterous.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.440
This is because
I'm Caribbean.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.942
I swear to God, I smelled

35:11.025 --> 35:12.985
chicken blood. Worse than the place
down the street we shut down.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.238
Hey. You want to turn this
into something?

35:15.321 --> 35:16.656
Sit down.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.201
If there aren't
any chickens,

35:20.284 --> 35:22.120
there aren't any chickens,
but we're not gonna know that

35:22.203 --> 35:23.621
until we take
a look around.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.289
The smell was coming
from back there.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.126
That is our sanctuary.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.086
I cannot let you
disrupt it.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.797
I understand your concerns,
but I need to go back there.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.715
I insist,
you cannot do that.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.176
Best I can do is have you
accompany us, please.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.514
You,

35:41.597 --> 35:42.682
come on, let's
go outside

35:42.765 --> 35:43.850
until they're done.

35:43.933 --> 35:44.934
Let's go.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.823
That's not a very heavenly thing
to do.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.185
Find anything?

36:27.852 --> 36:28.978
Oh, yeah.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.481
Wow.

36:36.777 --> 36:37.778
What the hell are they up to?

36:37.862 --> 36:39.238
I don't know.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.532
He just asked to rent
that closet.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.367
Did a woman ever come
down here with him?

36:43.451 --> 36:44.785
Yeah, once.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.997
I'm telling you,
that's all I know.

36:50.791 --> 36:51.918
Drop it.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.131
Don't.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.051
Come here.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.178
Both of you,

37:03.471 --> 37:05.181
on your knees.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.768
I said on your knees.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.774
I told you not to come in here.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.408
Where's the
other guy?

37:24.492 --> 37:26.118
He ran. Let's go.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.536
Let's go.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.254
You all right?

37:36.837 --> 37:37.797
Yeah.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.716
Let's go.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.207
Come on.

38:51.954 --> 38:53.873
We're not going to make
it back to the truck.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.124
I know.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.001
Here.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.085
Take this.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.211
All right.
I'll be right back.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.296
Michael.

39:00.379 --> 39:01.547
Michael!

39:51.472 --> 39:52.556
You all right?

39:52.640 --> 39:53.808
Yeah, thanks.

40:22.503 --> 40:25.423
The General should know by now
not to mess with us.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.466
The General...

40:27.550 --> 40:29.552
didn't send me.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.348
Who did?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.891
Who sent you?

41:01.876 --> 41:02.918
Lincoln!

41:04.128 --> 41:05.379
We've got some news.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.547
So do I.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.466
We're staying low
for two days.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.176
Christina's promised
to get rid of Krantz.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.011
I think she's lying.

41:12.094 --> 41:14.430
I know it sounds crazy,
but she said she's going

41:14.513 --> 41:17.057
to change the Company
and how it operates.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.059
So what, the Company's gonna go
nonviolent now?

41:19.143 --> 41:21.562
-Just hear me out.
-I'm telling you. I think she's lying.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.272
It's from the church.
Some kind of credential.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.149
There were some automatic
weapons in there, too.

41:25.232 --> 41:27.985
And trust me, if there's
fake IDs and weapons,

41:28.068 --> 41:29.403
something big's
about to go down.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.696
Your mom,

41:30.779 --> 41:31.947
she said after two days,

41:32.031 --> 41:33.574
that's when she would
make the change.

41:33.908 --> 41:34.783
Yeah.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.076
Take a look at the date
on that laminate,

41:36.535 --> 41:37.661
two days away.

41:37.745 --> 41:38.954
You think that's just
a coincidence?

41:39.038 --> 41:40.831
Come on Lincoln, you can't
be surprised

41:40.915 --> 41:42.500
that a woman
that would abandon her kids

41:42.583 --> 41:43.792
would be less
than truthful

41:43.876 --> 41:45.002
about her intentions
right now.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.171
Hey, where you going?
I need to talk to her.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.964
Just take a moment.
Let's figure this out.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.633
If she's looking to
head the Company,

41:50.716 --> 41:53.552
there has to a more realistic
plan than a one-man

41:53.636 --> 41:54.512
frontal assault.

41:54.595 --> 41:55.721
She'll listen to me.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.181
She asked you not
to come back, Linc.

41:57.264 --> 41:58.224
That's a warning.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.721
Lincoln's back at the plaza.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.101
I think we need to realize
he's more of a threat

42:42.184 --> 42:43.227
than we gave him
credit for.

42:43.310 --> 42:44.353
He found the mansion.

42:44.436 --> 42:46.272
His guys got the stash
at the church.

42:46.355 --> 42:47.731
He's not going to stop.

42:48.482 --> 42:50.192
I told him to stay away.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.208
Christina, we have a clean shot.

43:18.554 --> 43:19.638
Take it.

43:19.722 --> 43:20.889
Take it.

44:00.304 --> 44:02.306
