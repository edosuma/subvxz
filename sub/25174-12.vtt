17:55.699 --> 17:56.742
- Let me guess.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.244
You're in Ms. Bennigan's class.
- Yeah.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.829
- Interesting area to explore,

18:00.913 --> 18:04.708
but we have to deduct points
for aggression.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.504
{\an3}- It's okay, Logan.
We got this.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.548
{\an3}You and I are going
to accomplish our goals.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.175
- This wasn't my goal.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.676
- Here they come.
Be professional.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.178
{\an3}Hello. Thank you
for coming to our booth.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.223
{\an3}This is Logan
and his hamster, Demetri.

18:19.306 --> 18:22.518
He has very large testicles.
- Oh, my God.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.144
{\an3}- Oh, don't worry.
I'm talking about the hamster,

18:24.228 --> 18:28.023
not the child.
- Those are not testicles.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.399
They're tumors.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.237
- How do you know?
- Because I'm a veterinarian

18:33.320 --> 18:35.697
and that is a female hamster.
- No.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.866
- Sorry, Caroline.
Unless it's a cure,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.701
cancer disqualifies you.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.537
- No! I need this.

18:41.620 --> 18:45.541
Are you sure they're not balls?
How could they not be balls?

my career

He/she better be grateful.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.473
Follicle Stimulating Hormone

19:01.557 --> 19:05.519
and Its Relationship to
Excessive Weight Gain.

Congratulations, Gus.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.523
I won the science fair!

[laughs]
- No, you didn't. Gus did.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.736
- Yeah, and I helped you raise
the money to freeze your eggs,

19:14.820 --> 19:17.114
which made you bloated
which inspired Gus

19:17.197 --> 19:19.241
to the project, so I win!

- Well, not all of us,
but good luck, girl.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.341
{\an1}- Dr. Meier,
if you want to suck out

19:36.425 --> 19:37.676
{\an1}some of the fat while
you're down there, go for it.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.596
- That's illegal, so no.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.932
- Oh, dear Lord, please give me
my pre-freezing-eggs body back.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.101
- We'll be right here waiting
for you when you get out.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.478
all: Bye.
- Ms. Snap, wait!

19:48.562 --> 19:50.439
- Gus? What are you doing here?
- Follow-up research.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.609
I need a picture of your
stomach at its fattest point

19:53.692 --> 19:55.485
if I have any chance
of going to state.

19:55.569 --> 19:59.031
