WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.128
What happened to you, dude?

00:03.128 --> 00:05.130
'Cause you just disappeared
for, like, four weeks.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.673
I can explain everything.

00:07.799 --> 00:12.137
So, after you left me
with the big, giant toilet paper bear,

00:12.137 --> 00:16.307
my staff, the <i>jīn gū bàng</i>, remember,
was taken by Niu Mowang,

00:16.307 --> 00:19.811
who was leading an uprising
against the Jade Emperor.

00:19.811 --> 00:23.273
So I went back home
with my dad for a few hours,

00:23.273 --> 00:25.775
even though it's, like,
much longer on Earth.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.527
But it's okay.

00:27.527 --> 00:31.406
I've returned to finish my quest
and find the Fourth Scroll.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.659
Okay, that was a lot.

00:34.659 --> 00:38.246
Yeah, and-- Oh, my auntie, Guanyin,
bought me a new cell phone.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.206
Cool, right?

00:44.586 --> 00:47.213
Hello, you didn't tell me
you invited a new friend.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.841
How do you do?
My name is Sun Wei-Chen.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.760
Do you go to school with Jin?

00:51.760 --> 00:54.095
Yeah, me and my auntie
just moved here recently.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.306
Oh, and I like your home.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.390
Stop!

00:57.390 --> 00:59.225
And that's a pretty necklace.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.810
This? This is very special.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.645
I show you the companion piece.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.023
- They have a companion piece.
- Oh.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.442
These two pieces go together.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.779
This is a green jade.
This is a orange jade.

01:10.779 --> 01:14.365
- It's very old, very rare.
- Cool.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.910
Can you teach my son some Chinese?

01:17.535 --> 01:19.621
- He's terrible!
- Oh.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.663
Sure, sure.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.625
Hey, okay, let's-- let's get a move on.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.834
I make you some tea, huh?

01:24.834 --> 01:26.920
- I'm good. We're good. Thank you.
- Uh...

01:28.546 --> 01:31.299
Wow, look at all these toys.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.385
Kugo Ren has so many friends here.

01:34.385 --> 01:37.806
Wait, so, you're still looking for
the Fourth Scroll?

01:37.806 --> 01:41.684
Yeah. My dad told me about a scholar
who might be able to help.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.979
His name is Ji Gong. The "Mad Monk."

01:45.563 --> 01:48.108
He was banished from Heaven
and now he lives on Earth.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.444
Okay, that sounds promising.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.445
Yeah.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.031
Jin, you do magic?

01:55.031 --> 01:57.283
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's not real magic like you can do.

01:57.283 --> 02:00.078
It's just a dumb thing
I bought on the Internet when I was 12.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.621
Show me.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.999
Uh, okay, but it's kinda been a while,

02:04.999 --> 02:07.669
so... [sighs] ...it might not be
super spectacular.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.420
- Okay.
- But, um...

02:10.630 --> 02:12.132
Let's see. Ah, here.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.552
- Ready?
- Yeah.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.303
And...

02:18.263 --> 02:20.306
Abracadabra!

02:20.306 --> 02:21.558
- What?
- Uh-huh.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.892
And then-- Ready?

02:27.355 --> 02:29.232
Wait, how-how did you do that?
That's amazing.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.109
It's magic. It's real magic.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.820
But it's a hot dog.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.822
It's also a flashlight.
That's not really magic.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.740
Okay.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.493
I'll learn this sausage man trick later.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.579
We should go see this monk.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.290
Okay. Although, I don't know.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.334
If you got this guy
who, like, knows all this stuff,

02:48.334 --> 02:49.961
do you really need me anymore?

02:49.961 --> 02:51.546
You don't wanna help me?

02:51.546 --> 02:54.048
No, it's just-- Uh-- I don't know.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.134
I don't really see
how I fit into this whole thing.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.928
Plus, I kinda have a biology project
that I have to do.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.974
Come on, Jin. You're my guide.
I know that from my dream.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.936
Right. [sighs] Yeah, yeah, let's do this.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.313
Although, I don't know,

03:08.313 --> 03:11.065
can we come up with something
a little bit cooler than "guide"?

03:11.065 --> 03:12.400
Servant?

03:12.901 --> 03:14.611
Yeah, no, you're right. Guide's better.

03:18.281 --> 03:22.118
Are you sure this is it?
It looks like a mini-mall.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.745
It says "temple."

03:24.287 --> 03:25.705
Come on. Let's go.

03:33.504 --> 03:36.507
This place doesn't seem super busy.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.846
- Could that be him?
- I don't know.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.022
- Huh?
- Are you Ji Gong?

03:51.606 --> 03:52.607
Larry.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.275
Try the bar.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.405
Oh. Hello.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.575
Table 7 needs napkins.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.203
I think he's drunk.

04:05.787 --> 04:06.913
What makes you say that?

04:06.913 --> 04:09.624
Oh, just, everything about him.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.126
Hello?

04:12.126 --> 04:13.753
What's up?

04:13.753 --> 04:18.007
Oh, hi. We're looking for a scholar
whose name is Ji Gong.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.969
More like Ji you gone. Eh?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.388
- Get out of here!
- Okay.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.890
Yeah, I don't think
there's any Chinese gods here.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.768
Guess I'm not a super good guide.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.733
Okay, I think I'm gonna go work on
my bio project now.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.110
O-Oh, okay.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.778
I mean, you've got your phone, right?

04:38.778 --> 04:41.197
So, you know,
just text me if you find anything.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.865
- Uh, yeah.
- See ya.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.034
You seem very excited about that project.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.997
Yeah, I don't know. I guess
I just really love biology.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.083
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.752
- Come on in. Yeah.
- Thanks.

04:57.171 --> 04:58.798
-<i>En garde!</i>
- Sorry about that.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.134
- No fair! You crossed the line.
- What? What does that mean?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.137
Oh, you got me.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.723
Okay, lower your weapons.
Real people coming through.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.642
- Oh, Amelia. Please, avenge my death!
- Sorry.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.144
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.771
- Hi. You must be Jin.
- Hi. Yeah.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.482
Hey, Meels, I have a tray of seltzers
ready in the kitchen.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.444
- Could you grab those?
- Yeah. I'll-- I'll be right back.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.322
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. and Mr. Taylor.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.657
Oh, no, please call me Margie Ann.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.909
Yeah. And I'm Dennis, and this is Holden.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.911
- Hi. Bye.
- Oh.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.747
The whole block?

05:30.747 --> 05:33.916
Sorry. Well, make yourself at home.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.711
- I prepared a little snack.
- Oh.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.463
Thank you so much.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.465
- Is this--
- Mm-hmm. Right there.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.217
- Wow, is this from, like, a restaurant?
- No.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.470
And I'm sorry
I didn't have time to prep more.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.014
I have an open house coming up,
so been a little slammed.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.474
This is-- Can I?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.142
- Oh, please.
- Thank you so much.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.646
- Pace yourself.
- Mmm.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.358
Sorry, it's just really good cheese.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.442
Thank you.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.378
Who are you? What are you doing here?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.255
I-I'm just looking for someone.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.966
Well, you're not gonna find them.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.760
Well, I didn't even say who.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.390
No one's here. Not even me.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.642
Okay, just-- Don't come closer.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.936
Why? You scared?

07:16.936 --> 07:19.439
No, it's your breath. Really bad.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.208
Ji Gong?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.809
Ji Gong.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.687
Is this your disguise?
A drunk bum?

08:01.606 --> 08:02.607
Maybe.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.650
Now tell me who you are!

08:04.650 --> 08:06.319
My name is Sun Wei-Chen.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.613
I think we're searching
for the same thing.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.366
The Fourth Scroll?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.873
You should give up now.
It's a waste of time.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.082
Why?

08:22.835 --> 08:27.882
A million miles I've traveled,
and it's all led me to this stupid town.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.301
Where you can't even get a good pizza.

08:30.301 --> 08:34.138
So it is here.
Did a crane speak to you too?

08:34.138 --> 08:36.140
What? A crane?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.768
- Uh, in your dreams.
- No.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.979
All right, come over here.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.316
Let me show you.

08:48.986 --> 08:49.987
Come on.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.867
This wasn't some dumb crane.
This was a lot of hard work.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.078
This took a ton of research.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.373
Look at these paintings. What do you see?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.000
Uh, colors.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.504
"Uh, colors." No, you idiot.

09:06.504 --> 09:10.466
This is everything you need to know
about the Fourth Scroll.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.262
- Look, you moron.
- Okay.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.763
Okay, fine. I'll explain it.

09:18.849 --> 09:23.604
Long ago, Sun Wukong guided a group
of pilgrims on a Journey to the West.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.981
They achieved enlightenment,

09:24.981 --> 09:28.734
and the wisdom of the sutras
was transcribed onto three scrolls.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.445
Discipline, Discourse and Philosophy.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.532
But, unbeknownst to many,

09:34.532 --> 09:38.619
there was a fourth scroll
containing the Sutra of Power.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.623
Makes the other scrolls
sound kinda dumb, right?

09:43.207 --> 09:47.086
Anyway, the legend goes that
the Buddha destroyed the Fourth Scroll

09:47.086 --> 09:50.464
and sprinkled its remains like Parmesan
on the earthly realm

09:50.464 --> 09:54.176
as a way of dispersing absolute power,
or whatever.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.262
A little dramatic if you ask me.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.351
Over time, two families, once peaceful,

10:02.351 --> 10:05.187
grew obsessed
with collecting its fragments

10:05.187 --> 10:07.565
in the hopes of controlling the territory.

10:07.565 --> 10:13.904
Their selfishness led to resentment,
which led to deceit, which led to war.

10:14.530 --> 10:18.659
I don't know if you know this,
but humans love war.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.745
It's like all they ever do.

10:20.745 --> 10:24.081
So, the Buddha made a proclamation.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.627
Only when
the warring factions find harmony

10:27.627 --> 10:30.588
will the ultimate power of the sutra
be revealed.

10:30.588 --> 10:35.384
Thus, the Fourth Scroll could be anywhere,
or anything.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.763
Could be a rock or a cloud.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.806
A pendant.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.558
I said anything, didn't I?

10:42.558 --> 10:45.269
What are we gonna do?
Sit around all day and just name objects?

10:46.520 --> 10:49.273
I gotta go. I gotta go.
Yeah. Thank you, thank you.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.858
Wait, that's it?

10:50.858 --> 10:54.695
How about a "Nice pictures, man.
Thanks for the info"?

10:55.404 --> 10:57.615
Oh, yeah. Amazing painting, yeah.
Thank you.

10:57.615 --> 11:01.369
I'll make sure my father know
that you help a lot. Thank you.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.164
Who is your father?

11:05.164 --> 11:07.375
The Monkey King. Sun Wukong.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.423
Okay, "determining your base metabolism."

11:14.423 --> 11:17.468
"First, place two fingers on your wrist
and count the beats for six seconds.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.721
Then multiply this by ten
to calculate your resting heart rate."

11:21.430 --> 11:22.515
Okay.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.853
- You ready?
- Yeah.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.689
And go.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.404
And stop.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.366
All right, that would be 60 for me.
What did you get?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.660
I think I might have done it wrong.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.786
Why? What did you get?

11:43.786 --> 11:45.496
Like a hundred and something.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.456
Yeah, I should probably
do it again.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.625
Maybe my parents stressed you out.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.711
- They stressed me out.
- Your parents are great.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
I feel like your dad
wanted to give me a hug.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.839
Oh, he definitely did.

11:55.631 --> 11:58.592
Well, I'm glad he didn't
'cause I ate a lot of cheese.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.555
Um. [sighs] Sorry, I gotta take this.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.724
- Yeah. Go. Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna be right back.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.893
Hey, Meels,
could you come help me with the scanner?

12:07.893 --> 12:09.979
It's making that beeping noise.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.065
- Hello?
- Jin, hi. I have some good news.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.860
Dude, I'm kind of
in the middle of something right now.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.987
Oh, okay. I just want you to know that--

12:17.987 --> 12:20.781
Just text it to me,
like a normal person, okay? Bye.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.033
Oh, okay. Bye.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.457
Mmm?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.916
Jin says he'll be back soon.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.501
That's okay. You can wait here until then.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.379
Here. Try it.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.672
Thank you.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.507
Hmm?

12:41.844 --> 12:42.970
Mmm.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.180
It's good.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.016
I'll give you some to take home. Hmm?

12:47.725 --> 12:48.726
Thank you.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.394
Cool label.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.981
You like my tea,

12:53.981 --> 12:56.901
and you like my pendant.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.444
Can I look at the pendant again?

12:58.944 --> 13:01.030
Yes, let me go get it.

13:01.030 --> 13:05.910
This orange jade is a family heirloom
on Jin's father's side.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.080
This one is from my family's side.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.500
- Oh.
- Look, look.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.584
Mmm.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.421
- Oh, you're back!
- Yeah. [in English] Hi.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.464
Hello!

13:19.048 --> 13:21.050
This is Wei-Chen, Jin's friend.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.471
It's been a long time
since you brought that out.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.057
I was just admiring it.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.934
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.186
- These two jade necklaces are a pair.
- Mmm.

13:32.186 --> 13:36.190
They have been in the family
for many generations.

13:37.566 --> 13:41.153
Each side of our family
had conflicts before.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.989
We lived in different places.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.117
When we got married,

13:47.660 --> 13:49.787
we hired someone to encase these together.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.705
Like this.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.963
This represents us being one family.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.759
You look nice.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.221
Very nice.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.602
Any news at the office?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.774
Not yet. [in English] Um, okay.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.485
Enjoy your Bible study, huh?

14:22.736 --> 14:24.822
- Oh. Goodbye.
- Yeah.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.160
<i>♪ Beyond repair ♪</i>

14:31.245 --> 14:34.957
<i>♪ Beyond repair ♪</i>

14:34.957 --> 14:37.334
Freddy? You home?

14:38.711 --> 14:42.006
I'm here to return
your "Number One Spicy Hot Sauce."

14:42.006 --> 14:43.924
It gave me the number twos.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.677
Over here, Danny.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.764
- Where?
- Here.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.731
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.701
Freddy, what are you doing in the wall?

15:10.701 --> 15:13.329
I'm trying to get my beauty sleep.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.498
You know this bed goes down, right?

15:16.498 --> 15:18.292
Of course.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.879
How else do you think I get in and out
every night?

15:21.879 --> 15:25.049
Seems dangerous to sleep like that.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.635
Why? What could go Wong?

15:31.472 --> 15:32.556
<i>Good night.</i>

15:33.223 --> 15:34.808
Oh, hi, Jin.

15:34.808 --> 15:38.520
Oh, sorry. Holden always forgets
to turn the TV off when he's done with it.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.022
Oh, yeah. No worries.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.149
You know what we should watch?
Amelia's play.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.776
I think it's recorded on here somewhere.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.862
- No, we really don't need to watch--
- Oh, come-- You're so good in it, Meels.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.072
- She is so talented.
- Mom!

15:48.072 --> 15:49.740
I am not just saying that.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.951
Uh, we should really go study actually.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.619
Jin, would you like to watch this?

15:53.619 --> 15:56.205
- Uh, yeah. Sure. Why not?
- Okay.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.709
Oh, actually, you know what?
Um, I should probably go study.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.295
Well, she might have been in the chorus,
but she deserved to be a lead.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.463
Yeah.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.467
Okay. I'll see you later, Margie Ann.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.552
And it's recorded. So, any time.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.931
The Lord asks for truth.
So here's the truth.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.100
Your pastries were stale.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.727
No, they were fresh.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.480
They were definitely not fresh.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.232
I just bought them!

16:23.232 --> 16:25.442
Okay, let's focus.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.362
Ephesians 4:15.
"Speaking the truth in love."

16:28.362 --> 16:30.906
We're telling her the truth.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.908
Her pastries were bad.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.035
Oh, please.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.870
I have something to say!

16:36.870 --> 16:39.707
I wish my son was more like Wei-Chen.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.585
- He's polite. And so handsome!
- Mmm.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.087
I agree! So handsome!

16:45.087 --> 16:46.714
Yeah, very true.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.925
Who could that be?

16:52.219 --> 16:53.053
Oh.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.471
Maybe that's Jin.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.389
Oh.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.475
May I help you?

16:59.018 --> 17:02.479
Good afternoon,
excuse me for bothering you.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.564
Wei-Chen!

17:04.440 --> 17:06.400
I've been looking for you.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.154
I'm really sorry about that.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.031
Uh-- No, don't worry about it.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.661
Wait, uh-- Why are you sorry?

17:18.996 --> 17:22.583
My mom. She can be annoying.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.753
Oh, no, I-- I mean-- I thought
she was, like, really nice, actually.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.548
Mmm. That's her superpower.
But she uses it for evil.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.050
Is that you?

17:32.926 --> 17:33.927
Yes.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.554
Yeah.

17:36.638 --> 17:43.020
So you're mad at your mom for,
um, like, saying too many nice things?

17:49.485 --> 17:52.905
She thinks she's being positive
but she's really just being fake.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.574
Yeah.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.870
Yeah, my parents don't really have
that problem.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.708
Like this morning, my mom told me
my earlobes were the wrong shape.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.883
Honestly, I wish she'd just say something
harsh to me every once in a while,

18:12.883 --> 18:14.760
instead of just sugarcoating everything.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.969
Yeah, I get that.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.182
Like, here, say something about my zit.
I know you see it.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.561
- What?
- My zit. Just say something but be honest.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.985
I think your zit's perfect.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.199
You are really terrible at this,
you know that?

18:37.199 --> 18:40.744
You're supposed to say
it looks like a Hot Tamale or something.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.829
- A Hot Tamale?
- Mm-hmm.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.957
I should say your zit looks like a Hot
Tamale? It doesn't look like a Hot Tamale.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.961
Jin, sweetie.
Would you like to join us for fajitas?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.133
- Yeah, love to.
- Yes, okay.

18:54.133 --> 18:58.011
I should probably call my mom
to let her know that I'm gonna stay.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.388
Yeah, go for it.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.810
<i>Hello?</i>

19:04.810 --> 19:07.729
Hey, Mom. Uh, yeah,
I'm still at the, uh, school thing.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.190
I was just wondering
if maybe I could stay for dinner?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.235
<i>Your friend Wei-Chen came by.</i>

19:13.235 --> 19:15.112
- What?
-<i>Yeah, yeah. And his uncle.</i>

19:15.112 --> 19:19.199
His uncle? Wait.
Mom, Wei-Chen doesn't have an uncle.

19:19.199 --> 19:23.704
<i>Yeah, he invited everyone out
for dinner at his restaurant.</i>

19:23.704 --> 19:25.998
<i>Come meet us.
I-- I'll send you the address.</i>

19:25.998 --> 19:29.334
-<i>They are very nice people, Jin.</i>
- Wait-- Mom, who is this guy?

19:29.334 --> 19:30.961
<i>Don't be rude, okay?</i>

19:30.961 --> 19:32.087
Hello?

19:34.131 --> 19:36.258
- Welcome.
- Yeah, I'm here for dinner.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.926
- Go on in.
- Thanks.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.432
I hear music,
but I don't hear singing.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.023
You're wasting the best part of the song.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.942
Are you okay?

19:56.153 --> 19:57.863
Hey, hey. Hey.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.823
Come sing, Mrs. Liu, it's your turn.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.580
Jin, Jin.

20:06.580 --> 20:11.210
- Hi.
- My sweet, handsome son, Jin.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.255
- Mom, are you drunk?
- No, no. I'm not drunk.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.174
I shared a beer with Mrs. Fan.

20:17.174 --> 20:21.261
I shared a beer with... myself.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.804
Have you met Wei-Chen's uncle?

20:22.804 --> 20:24.473
Mr. Gong. Mr. Gong.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.643
This is my son. My handsome son, Jin.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.478
- Hello, Jin.
- Huh?

20:29.478 --> 20:30.604
Hi, yeah, we've met.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.564
- Really? I don't think so.
- Yep. Over there.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.149
- I never go over there.
- Okay.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.568
Welcome to my restaurant.
Have something to eat.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.529
Mmm. This song's so good,
I'm gonna sing it.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.073
- Yeah!
- No, wait, Mom--

20:41.073 --> 20:43.158
Hey, loosen up, buddy.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.707
- I need to explain.
- Okay.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.502
Just-- Follow me.

20:59.216 --> 21:03.553
Okay, so, uh, please explain.
Why did you bring everyone here?

21:03.553 --> 21:05.889
Me? No, it's Ji Gong's idea.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.893
The drunk busboy dude? That's Ji Gong?

21:09.893 --> 21:13.689
Yeah, he say it's just a disguise,
but I think... [sighs] ...he's really drunk.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.482
Okay, great.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.859
Uh, he told me
all about the Fourth Scroll.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.195
And I came to tell you,
but you weren't home.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.365
- And he must have followed me.
- Right, that's the other thing.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.784
Why would you go to my house
without telling me?

21:25.784 --> 21:29.037
I tried,
but you said you were doing biology.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.415
Ice-cold beer!

21:31.999 --> 21:35.377
Who wants one?

21:36.503 --> 21:38.046
Dad's here?

21:39.464 --> 21:40.632
Yeah.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.430
Let the couple sing!

21:47.055 --> 21:50.017
Oh--

21:56.690 --> 21:57.941
- Repeat.
- Repeat what?

21:57.941 --> 21:59.234
- Repeat "So good."
- I can't hear you.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.695
Jin, listen to me.
The Fourth Scroll.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.531
I think it's here, and it has
something to do with your parents.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.158
Sorry, what?

22:07.200 --> 22:09.244
I think it might be
your mom's jade pendant.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.248
You keep missing your cue!

22:13.248 --> 22:14.541
My wife. She's always...

22:14.541 --> 22:15.459
so pushy!

22:17.794 --> 22:21.006
If I don't push him, he doesn't move!

22:21.006 --> 22:22.841
Of course I know how to move.

22:22.841 --> 22:26.345
So you showed up at my house
and demanded to see my parents' jewelry?

22:26.345 --> 22:29.139
I saw warring factions
in Ji Gong's painting.

22:29.639 --> 22:32.059
Always fighting. Just like your parents.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.271
That's your logic?
You've gotta be kidding me, right?

22:36.271 --> 22:38.148
No, I'm serious.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.734
They say their families were at war
for generations.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.695
Ji Gong has searched for the scroll
for years.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.949
- And he agrees, this might be it.
- Mmm. Okay, yeah. Great.

22:47.949 --> 22:51.161
What-- Uh, Chinese Jack Sparrow over there
told you about it.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.663
Definitely. He seems like
a reliable source of information.

22:54.331 --> 22:59.711
I pushed him to ask for
a promotion and now he's going to get it!

23:00.754 --> 23:01.755
I didn't get it.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.298
What?

23:03.298 --> 23:04.508
I didn't get the promotion.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.386
Pat got the job.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.035
Where is the ice?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.413
Ice.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.497
Christine.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.625
Why are you mad?

23:40.502 --> 23:42.712
Why aren't you mad?

23:42.712 --> 23:45.215
Pat hasn't even been there one year.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.050
I thought about it.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.427
I'm just going to quit.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.303
You want to quit?

23:51.054 --> 23:52.639
How can you not discuss this with me?

23:52.639 --> 23:54.349
How are we going to live?

23:54.349 --> 23:55.976
We have savings.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.687
Not enough for you to quit.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.150
We only need enough for a few months.

24:03.150 --> 24:06.653
Listen to me. There's not enough in there.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.071
Are you kidding me?

24:08.071 --> 24:09.364
You must be drunk.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.496
Where did our savings go?

24:18.081 --> 24:19.875
I needed to purchase inventory.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.793
For the green powder.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.878
How much?

24:23.670 --> 24:26.047
It was an investment!

24:26.047 --> 24:27.132
How much?

24:29.092 --> 24:30.093
Half.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.024
I'm going home.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.569
Okay, I'll see you later.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.740
Some people can't hold their karaoke,
am I right?

24:51.740 --> 24:53.074
All right. Next song.

24:53.074 --> 24:56.995
I'm-- I'm sorry. This looks bad.

24:56.995 --> 25:00.540
But this is necessary
to stop the uprising.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.917
...singing, ladies.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.003
If the pendant contains the power...

25:08.256 --> 25:09.299
The pendant.

25:12.385 --> 25:13.428
Wei-Chen.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.520
Ji Gong!

25:21.520 --> 25:22.854
Wei-Chen!

25:37.786 --> 25:38.787
Ji Gong!

25:40.080 --> 25:41.122
Oh, hey.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.874
So that's your plan?

25:43.416 --> 25:46.211
Distract everyone
so you can steal the pendant for yourself?

25:47.921 --> 25:48.964
Yeah.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.800
Wasn't that your plan too?

25:53.635 --> 25:54.761
You don't understand.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.931
The Jade Emperor and my father need this.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.143
You may not know this,

26:02.143 --> 26:05.772
but a long time ago,
your father stole my job.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.483
That's right.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.152
I was supposed to be Great Sage!

26:11.152 --> 26:12.571
I don't believe you.

26:12.571 --> 26:16.074
I don't care if you believe me.

26:17.033 --> 26:20.954
Because this right here,
this is my ticket home.

26:21.913 --> 26:22.914
Thanks for the tip.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.293
Oh, hey. Jin.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.377
Hey!

28:16.736 --> 28:18.071
I'm fine. I'm fine.

28:25.578 --> 28:27.872
- We should do this more often.
- Mmm.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.298
- Jin.
- Where've you been?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.635
Abracadabra.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.014
Did you steal my mom's pendant?

28:46.558 --> 28:48.977
Uh, what? No.

28:48.977 --> 28:53.398
Well, yes, uh,
but I stole it back from Ji Gong.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.235
Okay, give it to me.

28:59.362 --> 29:00.363
What?

29:00.864 --> 29:02.615
No. I need this.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.577
- Wei-Chen, give it to me.
- Hey!

29:07.328 --> 29:08.538
This is important to me.

29:09.164 --> 29:13.126
It's important to you?
It's important to my parents.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.503
They just got into a huge fight
because of you.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.298
I don't care who you are.
I don't care what's going on in Heaven.

29:18.298 --> 29:22.385
You can't just come into our house
and take our things and lie to their face.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.639
I lied?

29:27.682 --> 29:30.185
No, you lied.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.731
You don't wanna be my guide.
You don't even wanna be my friend.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.155
Wei-Chen, that's not what this is about.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.074
That doesn't belong to you.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.327
- Give it back.
- Hey!

29:53.041 --> 29:56.085
- Jin, I-- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Stop!

30:23.112 --> 30:25.240
<i>Not what you were looking for?</i>

30:33.248 --> 30:37.752
Well, Mrs. Guardia,
I'm sorry to say, your fridge is broken.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.213
I'll try to find you a replacement ASAP.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.383
Thanks for trying, Jamie.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.552
The fridge's been here
since I bought the place.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.470
I'm surprised it's lasted this long.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.682
Oh.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.477
Here.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.105
Before it goes bad.

30:58.147 --> 31:00.942
<i>Papas con chorizo.</i> Your favorite.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.905
Only when you make it. Thank you.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.365
Oh, before I forget.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.953
Here. I teach a Shakespeare class
at the junior college.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.455
Next week,
we're having a student showcase.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.000
Will you be performing?

31:17.000 --> 31:20.086
No. No, I'm just behind the scenes.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.505
Well, it's not for everyone.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.550
Now, I have to get back to my show.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.051
Sure thing, Mrs. Guardia.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.852
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

31:36.603 --> 31:39.147
<i>But this is so crazy. This you?</i>

31:39.147 --> 31:40.857
<i>What could go Wong?</i>
