01:02.145 --> 01:10.235
Love's A Bitch

01:16.451 --> 01:17.910
What did you do?

01:19.412 --> 01:21.205
- What did you...?
- Nothing!

01:21.331 --> 01:22.664
Nothing? Bullshit!

01:23.958 --> 01:26.585
Fuck, he's bleeding to death.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.421
They still coming?

01:30.965 --> 01:33.926
- They still behind us?
- I can't see them.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.595
Shit, he's bleeding a lot.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.264
- Stop the bleeding.
- I can't.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.683
- Use your finger.
- There's too much.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.854
Here come those bastards. Faster!

01:45.980 --> 01:47.815
Fuck!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.066
Faster!

01:51.444 --> 01:53.028
Motherfuckers!

01:58.243 --> 02:00.160
- Fucking hell!
- Watch out!

02:10.380 --> 02:12.089
- Shit, he fell.
- Is he dead?

02:12.215 --> 02:15.509
Why did you fuck
with those bastards?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.678
Is he dead?

02:17.804 --> 02:19.054
Answer me!

02:19.180 --> 02:23.684
No, but he keeps falling.
He's bleeding even more!

02:27.605 --> 02:28.981
I've covered his wound.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.941
Get down!

02:32.026 --> 02:34.319
They've got a fucking gun!

02:50.086 --> 02:53.255
Hurry! Let's go to Chilaquil's.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.927
Motherfucker!

03:01.681 --> 03:04.099
- Faster.
- Get down, man.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.148
Step on it!

03:23.912 --> 03:27.748
The window! The window, that's it!

03:29.918 --> 03:35.714
Octavio and Susana

03:55.652 --> 03:57.277
Are you ready?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.155
What's your stake?

04:01.115 --> 04:02.407
Ten thousand.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.535
OK for 10,000?

04:06.412 --> 04:07.621
Go on then.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.832
You're on for 10.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.585
10's the stake.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.431
Heat 'em up!

04:35.608 --> 04:37.067
Marks!

04:41.155 --> 04:42.864
Let them go!

04:56.045 --> 04:57.421
Cofi!

04:58.506 --> 04:59.965
Cofi, come here!

05:04.387 --> 05:06.388
Fucking dog!

05:20.570 --> 05:22.612
Hello, senora.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.365
How's he been?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.743
Better. The fever broke.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.332
Susana, I can't watch him tomorrow.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.875
Why?

05:36.210 --> 05:39.755
I have to help my sister move,

05:39.881 --> 05:41.340
and go to the market.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.508
Senora, give me a break!

05:43.634 --> 05:46.887
I have a match final. I'll iron tonight.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.305
No.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.390
Leave the kid with your mother.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.142
My mother?

05:53.061 --> 05:55.729
Just this week. Then I'll work it out.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.273
No.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.859
I raised my children,

06:01.611 --> 06:03.695
now you raise yours.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.355
Go on, Turco!

06:41.943 --> 06:43.860
Get him, eat him!

06:43.986 --> 06:46.071
Do I stop it? He'll kill him.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.659
It's cool. He's back on top.

06:50.785 --> 06:51.827
Kill him!

07:04.298 --> 07:07.092
- What's up, Ma?
- Sit down and eat.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.928
How's it going, little dude?

07:11.389 --> 07:13.223
- How's he doing?
- Better.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.064
Thank you.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.983
Know what?
A baby born in Guadalajara

07:23.109 --> 07:25.444
gets a finger up his ass.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.697
- Why?
- To see what he'll be.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.408
If he kicks,
he'll be a soccer player.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.660
If he screams, a mariachi.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.913
And if he laughs, he'll be a homo.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.667
What about girls?

07:40.793 --> 07:43.503
We finger them until they're 18.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.674
Stop bullshitting, Octavio.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.593
Susana?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.556
Susana? Did you bleach my uniform?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.517
Look at it!

08:02.982 --> 08:04.399
And Cofi?

08:05.359 --> 08:07.277
Where is that fucking dog?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.614
- No "hello"...?
- Where?

08:10.740 --> 08:13.325
- I don't know.
- Sit and eat.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.036
You let him out again, right, bitch?

08:17.121 --> 08:20.332
I always tell you to watch it
when you go out!

08:21.709 --> 08:23.418
- Lay off!
- Who asked you?

08:24.003 --> 08:27.631
You don't care about that dog.
I feed it.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.509
This is between me and my wife.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.512
I'm the one who let him go,
so lay off her.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.639
Keep out of it!

08:35.765 --> 08:37.974
Shut up, please.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.820
Here's your dough,
less 500 for my cut.

08:53.449 --> 08:56.201
- Just luck, fatso.
- Cool.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.621
- See you Saturday.
- OK.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.250
What about your fucking dog?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.835
Barbecue it if you'd like, shithead!

09:07.296 --> 09:09.798
Champignon, move that dog!

09:17.640 --> 09:20.100
Fucking dog can't get enough!

09:20.226 --> 09:21.893
Give him to me.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.729
He won't budge.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.358
Sic him on those dogs.
That will cool him off.

09:31.779 --> 09:32.862
Good idea.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.535
It's in the bag.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.747
- Hey, that's Octavio's dog.
- Exactly.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.508
- Can I?
- Yes.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.515
Thanks for earlier.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.017
What?

10:44.143 --> 10:47.437
That was cool, taking the blame.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.486
What happened here?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.405
It's nothing.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.993
Did Ramiro do this to you?

11:03.954 --> 11:06.247
Yes, but he didn't mean it.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.959
Didn't mean it?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.212
You know what he's like.

11:14.382 --> 11:18.593
Why do you put up with it?
He treats you like shit.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.307
Not always.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.937
Are you stupid
or just pretending?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.263
Someone's here for you.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.727
- Hang on.
- Uh-huh.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.525
You know Ramiro doesn't want
Susana in your room.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.152
We were watching TV!

12:17.278 --> 12:20.029
Your brother doesn't like it,
neither do I.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.906
It's the last time, you hear me?

12:22.032 --> 12:23.825
The last!

12:25.286 --> 12:27.620
- What's up?
- You won't believe it.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.832
- What?
- Your dog killed Jarocho's Pancho.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.417
What happened?

12:32.543 --> 12:34.961
Jarocho sicced Pancho on Cofi,

12:35.087 --> 12:36.546
but Cofi saw him coming.

12:36.672 --> 12:40.175
He snapped his neck
and killed him.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.594
- Where's Cofi?
- Here he comes.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.929
Cofi! Here!

12:49.059 --> 12:50.310
He's all right.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.937
The other dogs didn't touch him.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.235
What gives, Octavio?

12:59.820 --> 13:02.030
Know what your dog did?

13:02.156 --> 13:05.492
- Yeah.
- So?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.911
It's OK, huh? It's cool.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.704
Cool?

13:10.581 --> 13:12.707
It's not cool at all.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.168
Bring Pancho.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.560
See what he did?

13:33.479 --> 13:36.815
This dog was worth
at least 20,000 pesos.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.903
Have him stuffed for your mantel.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.198
Don't be a smartass, kiddo.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.994
You have two choices.
Pay me, or pay me.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.121
Why should I pay you?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.958
Want to play with me? OK.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.378
Wait! Why did you
set Pancho on him?

14:06.720 --> 14:09.681
Listen,
give me your dog,

14:09.807 --> 14:11.432
and I'll forget it.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.394
You're nuts.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.273
Start saving,

14:18.399 --> 14:20.358
'cause you're gonna pay.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.572
Make Ramiro pay if you're so cool.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.741
Afraid he'll kick your ass again?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.161
No way, asshole.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.622
I'm not taking any more shit.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.125
Got it, Octavio?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.087
Let's go.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.846
What's up?

14:55.060 --> 14:57.061
Got a joint?

14:59.440 --> 15:03.026
Ramiro, I need money.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.321
Don't got any. Payday's Friday.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.448
So what do I do?

15:08.574 --> 15:11.451
The baby needs diapers
and formula,

15:11.577 --> 15:14.162
and the eggs you eat aren't free.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.539
- Got no money.
- "Got no money".

15:21.253 --> 15:23.504
So you got no money?

15:23.631 --> 15:25.089
Are you deaf?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.384
Aren't drugstores good business?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.013
Keep your mouth shut, or else.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.518
Asshole!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.813
One word and you're dead.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.819
Being tough won't make you smart.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.661
- Jimena took my headband.
- Give it back.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.163
It's my headband!

16:39.289 --> 16:41.040
No, it was a gift.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.335
Liar, I bought it at the store.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.296
Give it to her. You never wear it.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.812
I'll get it!

17:04.940 --> 17:07.483
Hello?

17:08.986 --> 17:11.946
- Who was it?
- They hung up.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.325
That mute man again?
Or that mute woman, maybe?

17:21.623 --> 17:23.332
I'll get it.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.004
Hello?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.175
Hung up again.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.552
Weird!

17:42.686 --> 17:44.562
Can I come in?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.481
What's up?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.651
You going out?

17:51.695 --> 17:53.321
Why?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.281
No reason.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.160
Something wrong?

17:59.286 --> 18:00.745
I...

18:02.539 --> 18:04.373
What happened?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.918
I'm in trouble.
I don't know what to do.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.590
I'm pregnant again.

18:13.592 --> 18:17.345
Shit, Susana,
you want another baby already?

18:17.471 --> 18:18.888
I didn't want it!

18:20.557 --> 18:22.308
Ramiro is going to kill me.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.523
No, he won't.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.483
He went nuts once,

18:30.609 --> 18:32.819
but he still married you, didn't he?

18:36.281 --> 18:39.742
Yes, but I don't know
if I want to stay with him.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.747
I can't have this baby, Octavio.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.001
Are you thinking about an abortion?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.504
Do you have a better idea?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.673
What the fuck can I do?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.886
Come away with me.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.889
What?

19:02.015 --> 19:03.474
Let's go away.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.893
Far away.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.770
I'm being serious!

19:07.896 --> 19:09.147
So am I.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.692
Don't talk shit.
Where would we go?

19:18.198 --> 19:21.701
- What are you doing, you jerk?
- Come away with me.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.672
- How many are they?
- Six bitches, three dicks.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.215
- Ready?
- Wait.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.093
That fat bitch is going in.
I smell cash.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.597
Ever fucked a fatso like her?

19:42.723 --> 19:46.392
- I have, it's hot.
- You have? Who?

19:46.518 --> 19:50.021
Your mother, asshole.

19:50.147 --> 19:54.775
Someday we'll do
that fucking bank, you'll see.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.360
Keep cool, Tarzan.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.280
We're going big time, man.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.325
After that fucking bank,
I'm out of here.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.493
It's not safe around here.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.331
We're on, she's in.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.890
Everyone down on the floor!

20:52.501 --> 20:56.295
BUSINESSMAN MURDERED
MOTIVE UNKNOWN

21:32.541 --> 21:35.376
MR. EZQUERRA'S WIDOW,
MRS. NORMA SAINZ, DIED

21:35.502 --> 21:37.295
FUNERAL AT 10:30 A.M.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.218
What's up?

22:27.095 --> 22:29.555
Want some dinner?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.557
Look what I brought you.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.685
Cool!

22:34.811 --> 22:38.189
No way! For me?

22:38.315 --> 22:40.649
Like it?

22:40.776 --> 22:44.111
Was a bitch to get it.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.756
Shh!

23:07.928 --> 23:09.970
Don't shout,
you'll wake the baby.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.597
Hang on.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.769
Baldy?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.731
- Don't wake him.
- Why not?

23:21.942 --> 23:23.567
It was hard to get him to sleep.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.362
I never see him, do I, Baldy?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.781
He's been puking all day.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.325
He's sick.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.411
Selfish bastard!

23:33.537 --> 23:37.248
Shut the fuck up.
I gave you the Walkman!

23:37.958 --> 23:41.585
I'm cool to you,
but you're always on my ass!

23:41.711 --> 23:44.130
- The baby, shit!
- Shut up!

24:11.700 --> 24:15.077
Wow, dude...
she's your brother's woman.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.914
Yeah, but I always liked her,

24:19.040 --> 24:20.916
even before they met.

24:21.042 --> 24:23.919
But he got her first.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.379
My ass!

24:25.505 --> 24:27.965
Ramiro doesn't care about her.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.385
But Susana does.
You're playing with fire, man.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.139
I can't stop thinking about her.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.893
There's thousands of bitches.
Why do you want to fuck her?

24:39.019 --> 24:41.562
I don't want to fuck her!

24:41.688 --> 24:43.689
I want her to leave with me.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.734
Yeah? With what money?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.365
You're going to fight him?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.785
Where do we get the bet money?

24:59.831 --> 25:03.125
- I'll pimp your sister.
- You asshole!

25:32.948 --> 25:34.657
Who's there?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.951
Phone call for Susana.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.536
Who is it?

25:38.662 --> 25:40.287
Her mother.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.499
Tell her to fuck off.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.668
She says it's urgent.

25:56.263 --> 26:00.307
Hello?

26:02.727 --> 26:04.603
Who was it?

26:07.399 --> 26:08.774
Me.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.985
You're nuts.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.783
What's wrong with you?

26:19.286 --> 26:21.161
Let go. Let go.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.669
No, Octavio.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.716
Not this way.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.013
Then how?

26:45.979 --> 26:48.981
This dog looks pretty sad to me.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.859
But it killed Jarocho's dog.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.069
You know this business?

26:55.447 --> 26:56.739
More or less.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.324
More or less?

27:00.452 --> 27:02.077
- Sargento?
- Yes.

27:02.203 --> 27:05.414
Sarge, take this dog.
Come with me.

27:12.213 --> 27:15.341
This is my business.
Zero taxes,

27:15.467 --> 27:17.843
zero strikes, zero unions.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.680
Pure hard cash.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.308
I take a loss now and then.

27:25.852 --> 27:29.104
This is Mac, my best investment.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.566
He's old, but he can still fight.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.736
I got the van from his winnings.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.696
We can be partners,

27:38.698 --> 27:41.408
with your dog, and my stake money.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.161
We'll split the profits 50-50.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.788
What do you think?

27:46.748 --> 27:49.458
- Sounds good.
- Good.

27:49.584 --> 27:53.170
Good for eight fights,
then we'll see.

27:53.296 --> 27:54.713
Fine.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.549
But first, your dog
goes a round with Mac.

28:01.012 --> 28:04.556
OK, it will cost you

28:12.857 --> 28:16.402
Don't bullshit me.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.445
What if your dog kills mine?

28:18.571 --> 28:20.197
And what if mine dies?

28:20.323 --> 28:23.325
But I don't have a van yet.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.207
I'll give you 2,500.
Will that do?

28:32.252 --> 28:34.211
Done.

28:42.178 --> 28:45.264
Condom! Bring Mac.

28:48.309 --> 28:51.812
Here's your take.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.819
Release them on three. Count.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.322
One...

29:02.449 --> 29:04.742
two...

29:04.868 --> 29:06.410
three!

29:14.544 --> 29:16.754
That's enough.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.464
Take your fucking dog.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.883
Sarge!

29:22.510 --> 29:24.595
Come back on Saturday at 12:00.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.681
It's payback time for Jarocho.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.445
- 20 is your change.
- Thank you.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.200
Did you find everything you needed?

29:46.326 --> 29:47.785
Except rubbers.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.622
You don't have my size.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.081
What the fuck are you doing here?

29:53.208 --> 29:56.502
- Shopping.
- Where did you get the dough?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.587
You don't have money, but I do.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.172
Stick it up your ass.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.217
I'll buy my family's things.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.344
Ring me up, or I'll call the manager.

30:07.055 --> 30:10.766
Asshole, get out or you're dead.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.520
I'm not Susana, you know.
You don't scare me.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.530
- What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.908
Fucking hell!

30:29.202 --> 30:30.661
Good afternoon.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.927
- Take it.
- What for?

30:47.053 --> 30:49.471
So you can take care of him.

30:50.598 --> 30:52.307
And him.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.872
Yes?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.374
Hey, brother, how are you?

31:17.500 --> 31:19.543
I'm very well.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.378
No, not much.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.548
Hang on.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.008
I can't hear anything.

31:26.134 --> 31:29.219
Neither can I. Why don't you leave?

31:39.647 --> 31:41.106
What's up?

31:42.817 --> 31:45.652
I couldn't get away.
Tomorrow, I promise.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.072
I miss you, too.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.703
Don't call here anymore,
Julieta's suspicious.

31:55.955 --> 31:59.082
No, I'm not angry.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.712
Tomorrow at 11:00.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.631
I love you.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.991
What's the matter?

32:33.117 --> 32:34.534
Stop!

32:39.540 --> 32:40.707
Stop, man!

32:40.833 --> 32:43.835
Keep out of my business, asshole!

33:11.114 --> 33:13.532
Here, pal, take this.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.786
- What's up, fatso?
- Just hanging, Jarocho.

33:17.912 --> 33:19.663
Why are you playing with girls?

33:19.789 --> 33:21.373
Because they got mean dogs.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.792
You're betting 15 on it?

33:23.918 --> 33:25.711
My dog beats all of yours.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.339
I'm talking to the ringmaster, princess.

33:29.465 --> 33:30.465
So...

33:30.591 --> 33:33.093
- 15?
- Make it 10.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.886
OK.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.890
Place your bets, senores.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.696
Waste him!

33:56.909 --> 33:58.243
Kill him!

34:04.751 --> 34:06.460
Ready?

34:10.298 --> 34:11.631
Let them go!

35:03.392 --> 35:04.976
I'll catch up.

35:24.455 --> 35:25.664
What are you doing here?

35:25.790 --> 35:27.749
Taking a stroll.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.335
Stroll elsewhere.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.214
Don't mess with us,
and especially not her.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.134
It's a free country, isn't it?

35:39.679 --> 35:43.056
To her, you're dead.
Don't forget that.

35:44.183 --> 35:46.434
You're hostile, sister-in-law!

36:00.783 --> 36:02.659
That's two you owe me.

36:02.785 --> 36:06.121
Don't be pissed, Jarochito.
Win some, lose some.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.648
What's up?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.027
Here.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.486
It's yours.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.531
But hide it, or my brother
will take it.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.700
Don't worry.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.118
Got another place to stash it?

36:45.244 --> 36:49.623
Yes. I put that other money
in a case in the closet.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.084
Shh!

36:53.211 --> 36:55.545
The baby's sleeping!

36:58.883 --> 37:02.844
This will be our bank, OK?

37:02.970 --> 37:04.512
Just yours and mine.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.932
Octavio, you stealing too?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.683
No.

37:08.809 --> 37:12.103
This money's clean,
so you'll come away with me.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.105
Come away with you?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.698
You still don't get it, do you?

37:23.824 --> 37:26.117
No, you don't get it.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.788
Jorge has cousins in Juarez.
We'll go there.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.375
We can open a store, we got cash.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.709
It'll be cool.

37:34.835 --> 37:36.169
No.

37:37.296 --> 37:40.799
I don't want any more trouble.
Can't you understand?

37:50.810 --> 37:52.435
Understand?

37:57.733 --> 37:59.442
Come away with me.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.180
Open the register, motherfucker!

38:29.765 --> 38:31.182
Open it!

38:35.146 --> 38:36.688
Open the register!

40:04.568 --> 40:06.403
I didn't say you could come in.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.655
What are you watching?

40:09.782 --> 40:11.699
None of your business.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.744
Change that shit. I don't like it.

40:16.330 --> 40:17.455
What do you want?

40:17.581 --> 40:20.208
I heard you're getting rich
with my dog.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.168
Your car is nice.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.753
Your dog?

40:24.380 --> 40:25.797
He's mine.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.591
Don't talk shit, little brother!

40:28.717 --> 40:32.804
He's as much mine as yours,
so I get half of the winnings.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.723
Anyway, look at him.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.852
Doesn't look like
you care about him much.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.396
I care more than you know.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.732
Give you money?
I'm not giving you shit.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.735
It's simple...

40:47.862 --> 40:52.031
cough it up, or I'll blow
your piggy bank away.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.746
Next time's for real,

40:58.873 --> 41:01.916
so you better get me my dough.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.753
"The cock crows... "

41:48.172 --> 41:51.799
What's up, Baldy?
Look what I got you!

41:57.765 --> 41:59.682
Look at all this!

41:59.808 --> 42:02.977
Your mom's going to put it away.

42:06.815 --> 42:07.982
We're millionaires!

42:08.108 --> 42:11.194
There's enough to live on
for two years.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.738
Come live with me.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.573
What do you say, eh?

42:17.451 --> 42:20.870
- Why, Octavio?
- Why what?

42:20.996 --> 42:23.081
Why do you want
to live with me?

42:30.047 --> 42:32.298
You still don't get it?

42:32.424 --> 42:34.801
No, I do get it.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.516
Give Jorge something to eat.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.648
I've got some business for you.

44:11.774 --> 44:14.025
Jarocho's got a class A dog.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.568
He wants to fight Cofi.

44:15.694 --> 44:18.112
Yeah, right!

44:18.238 --> 44:20.740
He'll bet 40,000.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.700
Forty?

44:22.826 --> 44:23.910
You in?

44:24.036 --> 44:26.788
That's too much for me.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.457
You're on your own.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.710
What about our deal?

44:32.836 --> 44:35.713
The deal was for eight fights.
We've done 15.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.840
That's enough.

44:37.966 --> 44:40.259
You won, I won, that's it. OK?

44:40.386 --> 44:41.761
OK.

44:41.887 --> 44:44.097
When does he want to fight?

44:46.058 --> 44:48.017
This Saturday.

44:48.143 --> 44:50.436
He wants it private, at Trujillo's.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.856
No outside bets, just you and him.

44:55.818 --> 44:56.818
All right.

44:58.487 --> 44:59.696
Do I confirm?

44:59.822 --> 45:01.322
OK.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.161
Hey, fatso,

45:07.287 --> 45:09.205
I need you to do me a big favour.

47:28.762 --> 47:29.971
How's the baby?

47:30.097 --> 47:33.683
Good. Growing, I guess.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.476
Got a name yet?

47:38.438 --> 47:41.357
if it's a girl, Susana.

47:42.401 --> 47:44.485
And if it's a boy?

47:46.446 --> 47:48.531
Octavio?

47:58.417 --> 48:01.002
Everything's ready.
We leave Sunday.

48:02.713 --> 48:05.381
But I'm going to need
some of the money.

48:07.092 --> 48:09.218
Saturday's the big one.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.222
Don't fight him anymore.

48:13.348 --> 48:15.933
We've got enough.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.518
One last one?

48:23.567 --> 48:25.651
What time is the bus to Juarez?

48:28.113 --> 48:30.364
It leaves at 12:00.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.658
Ramiro will still be at work.

48:36.204 --> 48:38.497
Don't worry about Ramiro.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.502
He won't fuck with us anymore,
I'm sure.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.512
Are you scared?

48:54.723 --> 48:56.515
It's heavy shit.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.145
Scared?

49:20.082 --> 49:21.248
Ma?

49:28.507 --> 49:31.759
So this is how
you take care of the kid?

49:43.522 --> 49:46.273
Shh!
What's wrong?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.484
Now you can stay drunk.

50:17.639 --> 50:18.931
What's up, Ma?

50:19.683 --> 50:21.976
Do you know what happened
to your brother?

50:22.102 --> 50:24.437
He didn't come home
last night.

50:24.563 --> 50:26.063
No idea.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.691
You don't know?

50:30.068 --> 50:31.944
He got beat up bad.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.656
He must have pissed off
a customer.

50:37.784 --> 50:40.244
They threatened to kill him.

50:40.912 --> 50:42.913
God knows what he's up to!

50:45.500 --> 50:48.419
He left with the baby and Susana.

50:52.424 --> 50:54.925
- Where to?
- I don't know where.

50:56.011 --> 50:58.345
Or if they'll be back.

51:01.224 --> 51:02.600
What?

51:18.742 --> 51:20.493
Goddamn it!

51:23.914 --> 51:26.290
Motherfucker! And that bitch!

52:02.119 --> 52:04.078
People Today

52:06.915 --> 52:12.211
With us today, someone
no man would want to miss...

52:12.337 --> 52:17.216
one of the most beautiful
women in Iberian America,

52:17.342 --> 52:19.844
Valeria Amaya!

52:22.097 --> 52:25.349
Thank you so much.

52:28.061 --> 52:30.104
I have to find her, damn it!

52:30.230 --> 52:33.774
She tricked you. I warned you.

52:33.900 --> 52:36.777
It wasn't her.
It was Ramiro, that asshole.

52:41.700 --> 52:44.285
This is your year.

52:44.411 --> 52:46.579
You represent "Enchant"
in Latin America,

52:46.705 --> 52:49.123
loads of models envy you...

52:50.500 --> 52:53.419
I'll find her!

52:53.545 --> 52:55.087
How much you got?

52:55.213 --> 52:57.631
- 7,000, and you?
- 10,000.

52:57.757 --> 53:00.593
I hope Jarocho
will go with that.

53:00.719 --> 53:03.679
I've got 3,000 at home,
I'll loan them to you.

53:05.223 --> 53:06.974
That woman's hot!

53:09.227 --> 53:11.645
Is it true
you have a new love?

53:11.771 --> 53:14.273
Yes, it's not just a rumour.

53:14.399 --> 53:17.401
In fact, he's here.

53:17.527 --> 53:21.780
- My love!
- Andres Salgado, no less!

53:31.041 --> 53:32.750
Please, have a seat.

53:35.086 --> 53:37.922
What a lucky guy!

53:38.757 --> 53:40.591
Let's go.

53:41.885 --> 53:44.178
Let's go. Cofi!

53:48.099 --> 53:53.395
OK, one more
personal question.

53:53.521 --> 53:56.273
Will you two get married?

53:56.399 --> 54:00.361
Not right away,
but we have a son...

54:00.487 --> 54:03.030
and I brought him.

54:03.156 --> 54:06.659
Richie!

54:06.785 --> 54:08.953
Isn't he cute!

54:11.206 --> 54:12.998
He looks just like Andres!

54:13.750 --> 54:15.626
He's got my white hair.

54:29.724 --> 54:33.435
What's up?
You didn't back out?

54:33.561 --> 54:36.397
- As you can see.
- You get the 40,000?

54:38.316 --> 54:41.193
- I only got 20,000.
- Will that do?

54:43.321 --> 54:46.907
You're on.
Playing for candy!

54:48.868 --> 54:51.245
Sargento, put the dogs in the pool.

54:53.415 --> 54:54.790
Ready!

54:56.042 --> 54:57.710
On your marks!

55:01.965 --> 55:03.173
Release them!

55:22.652 --> 55:24.862
You crazy fucker!

55:24.988 --> 55:26.447
Fight's over!

55:26.573 --> 55:29.450
He was winning!
Why did you shoot?

55:29.576 --> 55:32.745
- It just went off.
- What's this shit?

55:32.871 --> 55:34.830
It's between you and him.

55:34.956 --> 55:37.458
Here's your money. And yours.

55:37.584 --> 55:39.543
This isn't fair, Mauricio!

55:39.669 --> 55:41.462
Work it out between you.

55:41.588 --> 55:45.507
Don't be cry-babies.
That's the business.

55:45.633 --> 55:47.801
You better scram,

55:47.927 --> 55:51.305
before things heat up.

55:51.431 --> 55:55.017
Complain to your brother.
I'll be waiting for him!

56:13.953 --> 56:16.705
- Where are you going?
- Start the car, wait for me.

56:31.971 --> 56:34.056
Forget something, princess?

57:02.961 --> 57:05.337
What did you do?

57:05.463 --> 57:07.381
- What did you...
- Nothing!

57:07.507 --> 57:09.258
Nothing? Bullshit!

57:14.013 --> 57:16.515
- Is he dead?
- No!

57:22.856 --> 57:25.691
Why did you fuck
with those bastards?

57:31.114 --> 57:32.573
Assholes!

57:46.629 --> 57:49.798
Thanks to Valeria Amaya
and Andres Salgado

57:49.924 --> 57:52.301
for being on the show.

57:52.427 --> 57:55.804
Friends, stay with us
for more surprises

57:55.930 --> 57:58.015
on "People Today".

58:01.936 --> 58:05.606
Valeria, I thought
you were with someone else.

58:05.732 --> 58:08.317
Well, now you know.

58:08.443 --> 58:09.943
So many rumours.

58:10.069 --> 58:14.239
- People love gossip.
- Laura, 20 seconds!

58:14.365 --> 58:16.783
Right, goodbye.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.912
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing, why?

58:20.038 --> 58:21.413
Have lunch with me.

58:21.539 --> 58:23.749
No thanks, Andres.

58:26.002 --> 58:30.756
You would say no
to Andres Salgado?

58:30.882 --> 58:34.801
Listen, the show's over.
The show is over.

58:34.928 --> 58:37.763
I have a surprise you'll love.

58:41.434 --> 58:43.227
OK, let's go.

58:49.567 --> 58:52.778
- Where are you going?
- To the restaurant.

58:52.904 --> 58:56.240
I said lunch,
I didn't say where.

59:03.831 --> 59:06.208
- Come in.
- Did you buy this place?

59:06.334 --> 59:09.628
- Not exactly.
- It's lovely!

59:10.380 --> 59:13.382
- You like it?
- Of course!

59:13.508 --> 59:16.093
This couch is just like mine.

59:16.219 --> 59:18.679
It's not like yours.

59:18.805 --> 59:20.514
It is yours.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.808
In the bedroom,
you'll find your clothes,

59:22.934 --> 59:24.893
your perfumes...

59:27.230 --> 59:28.981
What are you playing at?

59:29.107 --> 59:32.818
That's not all.
Look at the view!

59:36.447 --> 59:38.115
You like it?

59:38.241 --> 59:42.202
- You've gone too far. I'm going.
- Wait!

59:43.496 --> 59:45.914
Take the keys to your apartment.

59:46.040 --> 59:48.333
What do you mean, my apartment?

59:48.459 --> 59:51.878
That's right, you're home!

59:54.048 --> 59:55.674
Idiots!

59:55.800 --> 59:57.801
Darling!

59:59.053 --> 1:00:01.513
What's this hole?

1:00:01.639 --> 1:00:05.100
I had enough to buy it,
but not to fix it.

1:00:05.226 --> 1:00:07.603
OK, enough!

1:00:07.729 --> 1:00:11.398
- You're jealous.
- Thanks!

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.358
I've never seen you
acting so well.

1:00:13.484 --> 1:00:15.444
You liked it?

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:19.072
- I love you, too.
- Sorry.

1:00:19.198 --> 1:00:21.241
I was joking.

1:00:21.367 --> 1:00:22.826
Bye!

1:00:22.952 --> 1:00:24.286
Wow!

1:00:24.412 --> 1:00:26.121
Thanks.

1:00:27.498 --> 1:00:30.042
Thanks for the magazine cover.

1:00:30.168 --> 1:00:31.835
Good luck, matador.

1:00:35.214 --> 1:00:38.675
My love, is it really true?

1:00:39.510 --> 1:00:41.428
- Honey?
- What?

1:00:41.554 --> 1:00:43.805
I spoke with Julieta.

1:00:43.931 --> 1:00:46.224
And?

1:00:46.351 --> 1:00:48.435
As of today, we're separated.

1:00:48.561 --> 1:00:52.773
For good? You're not lying to me?

1:00:52.899 --> 1:00:55.150
Starting tonight,
we can sleep together.

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:57.861
Are you sure about this?

1:00:57.987 --> 1:00:59.571
I am.
Have you changed your mind?

1:00:59.697 --> 1:01:02.616
I just can't believe it!

1:01:37.110 --> 1:01:39.236
- Darling?
- Yes?

1:01:39.362 --> 1:01:40.779
What shall we toast with?

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:47.411
Ah, I knew
I forgot something.

1:01:47.537 --> 1:01:49.746
Please,
keep an eye on the food.

1:01:49.872 --> 1:01:52.958
You know I can't fry an egg.

1:01:53.084 --> 1:01:55.210
You're my special guest!

1:01:55.336 --> 1:01:57.212
A guest in my own home?

1:01:59.924 --> 1:02:01.967
You are the guest.
Stay here.

1:02:02.093 --> 1:02:03.301
Darling...

1:02:06.055 --> 1:02:08.765
- Come over here.
- Hurry back.

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:10.976
You bet I will.

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:47.387
Richie! Shut up!
What's the matter?

1:03:13.706 --> 1:03:19.294
Daniel And Valeria

1:03:34.352 --> 1:03:36.228
Excuse us.

1:03:36.354 --> 1:03:37.813
So?

1:03:37.939 --> 1:03:40.607
It's hard to diagnose...

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:42.984
massive blood loss,

1:03:43.110 --> 1:03:46.071
double fractured tibia and fibula,

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:49.324
open fractured femur...

1:03:49.450 --> 1:03:53.286
the femoral biceps are
almost completely severed.

1:03:53.412 --> 1:03:57.207
- It's a miracle she's alive.
- Will she make it?

1:03:57.333 --> 1:03:59.125
I hope so.

1:03:59.252 --> 1:04:00.961
When can I see her?

1:04:01.087 --> 1:04:02.671
I don't know...

1:04:02.797 --> 1:04:06.341
in two days,
depending on how she recovers.

1:04:07.468 --> 1:04:10.387
Is there a relative I should notify?

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:13.723
Her family's in Spain.
I don't know if I should tell them.

1:04:15.059 --> 1:04:17.310
Will you take the responsibility?

1:04:20.273 --> 1:04:22.357
- Thanks, Nacho.
- No problem.

1:04:22.483 --> 1:04:24.526
My regards to Julieta.

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:26.945
Sorry, it's habit.

1:04:27.071 --> 1:04:28.697
Kiss your girls for me.

1:04:28.823 --> 1:04:30.657
No problem.

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:38.415
One, two, three.

1:04:44.422 --> 1:04:46.298
Don't tire her out.

1:04:46.424 --> 1:04:48.008
No.

1:04:51.971 --> 1:04:54.472
I'll never play soccer again.

1:04:57.143 --> 1:04:59.644
Shh! Take it easy.

1:05:01.522 --> 1:05:02.939
And Richie?

1:05:03.065 --> 1:05:04.983
He's fine, he's at home.

1:05:06.152 --> 1:05:12.657
Our home...

1:05:15.202 --> 1:05:17.245
- Daniel...
- Huh?

1:05:17.371 --> 1:05:19.497
Don't tell my father.

1:05:20.416 --> 1:05:23.168
- Isn't it time you spoke to him?
- I don't want to.

1:05:23.294 --> 1:05:25.378
He'd say I deserved it.

1:05:28.174 --> 1:05:30.634
OK. Don't worry.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:34.512
Sleep...

1:05:34.639 --> 1:05:36.473
sleep.

1:05:36.599 --> 1:05:38.683
I'm here with you.

1:05:43.022 --> 1:05:44.940
- Daniel?
- Huh?

1:05:45.066 --> 1:05:46.900
Are you awake?

1:05:48.486 --> 1:05:49.986
What is it?

1:05:50.112 --> 1:05:52.030
Daniel, I'm scared.

1:05:54.116 --> 1:05:56.284
Look at me!

1:05:56.410 --> 1:05:59.037
Don't worry, they'll take it off.

1:05:59.163 --> 1:06:01.623
You've been very brave.

1:06:04.335 --> 1:06:06.252
The truth is...

1:06:06.379 --> 1:06:08.380
I'm scared to death.

1:06:10.007 --> 1:06:13.051
You'll be fine, you'll see.

1:06:22.478 --> 1:06:24.521
Richie, look!
Look who's here!

1:06:24.647 --> 1:06:27.941
Your mommy is back.

1:06:29.193 --> 1:06:31.569
I missed you,
my little one.

1:06:35.533 --> 1:06:37.826
What did you do without me?

1:06:41.998 --> 1:06:44.457
My love!

1:06:44.583 --> 1:06:47.043
Welcome home, my love!

1:06:51.298 --> 1:06:53.800
The first one to blink loses, eh?

1:07:07.815 --> 1:07:08.857
No!

1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:14.738
You lose, you lose!

1:07:24.749 --> 1:07:26.708
What are you doing?

1:07:26.834 --> 1:07:28.710
I'm examining you.

1:07:29.879 --> 1:07:33.465
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1:07:33.591 --> 1:07:35.133
I can't.

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:38.470
Yes, you can.

1:07:38.596 --> 1:07:40.680
Let's see how you do it.

1:07:49.565 --> 1:07:51.024
Sure you'll be all right?

1:07:51.776 --> 1:07:54.069
Sure. I'm an expert.

1:07:54.195 --> 1:07:56.946
Left... right...

1:07:58.657 --> 1:08:00.283
What if you need something?

1:08:00.409 --> 1:08:03.787
I've got Richie, don't I?

1:08:06.457 --> 1:08:09.417
Whatever you do, stay seated.

1:08:10.044 --> 1:08:13.838
- Even if the earth quakes?
- Let it crumble.

1:08:13.964 --> 1:08:16.758
But you don't leave that chair!

1:08:16.884 --> 1:08:19.344
- I'll be back by 8:00.
- I'll be here.

1:08:19.470 --> 1:08:22.097
- Good luck.
- I'll miss you.

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:31.142
Fetch, sweetheart.

1:10:31.268 --> 1:10:34.062
Good. Bring it back.

1:10:39.735 --> 1:10:42.987
Good, Richie.
You're a good boy.

1:10:43.948 --> 1:10:45.406
Bring me the ball.

1:10:49.328 --> 1:10:51.579
Run, run!
No, Richie!

1:10:54.208 --> 1:10:56.501
Shit! Richie!

1:10:57.753 --> 1:10:59.963
Richie, good boy!

1:11:09.431 --> 1:11:11.724
Mommy's here!

1:11:19.775 --> 1:11:21.818
It's me!

1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:25.196
I'm in the kitchen.

1:11:25.322 --> 1:11:26.698
How did it go?

1:11:26.824 --> 1:11:29.993
From the doctor,
so I don't have to carry you.

1:11:31.912 --> 1:11:35.790
- How's my princess?
- Richie went into the hole.

1:11:36.792 --> 1:11:39.669
- How?
- He was running after the ball.

1:11:40.838 --> 1:11:42.672
He'll get out.

1:11:42.798 --> 1:11:44.674
That was five hours ago.

1:11:47.928 --> 1:11:50.013
What can we do?

1:11:53.350 --> 1:11:55.852
- I know!
- What are you doing?

1:11:55.978 --> 1:11:57.645
Chocolates.

1:11:57.771 --> 1:12:00.732
He'll come right out.

1:12:00.858 --> 1:12:02.817
Wait, I'm coming with you.

1:12:03.652 --> 1:12:07.697
Here, try the crutches.

1:12:07.823 --> 1:12:10.033
Why won't he come out?

1:12:10.159 --> 1:12:12.827
He must be stuck down there.

1:12:12.953 --> 1:12:16.748
Don't worry about it, he'll come out.

1:12:19.043 --> 1:12:21.336
I tried that.

1:12:21.462 --> 1:12:23.713
I hear noises,
but he won't come out.

1:12:25.090 --> 1:12:28.468
Don't worry, he'll come out.

1:12:28.594 --> 1:12:32.555
You want an omelette? I'm hungry.

1:12:32.681 --> 1:12:36.100
He's all right.
A bit disoriented, but he's here,

1:12:36.226 --> 1:12:37.685
not stolen, not lost.

1:12:37.811 --> 1:12:40.396
He's here with us, OK?

1:12:49.656 --> 1:12:51.115
Daniel...

1:12:52.076 --> 1:12:53.785
- Daniel?
- What?

1:12:53.911 --> 1:12:55.828
Listen, it's Richie.

1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:08.841
Yes, it's him.

1:13:11.345 --> 1:13:13.096
- So?
- Wait.

1:13:34.952 --> 1:13:36.035
- Richie?
- Daniel?

1:13:36.161 --> 1:13:39.038
- What?
- Hurry, I think I heard him.

1:13:42.376 --> 1:13:44.502
- Where is he?
- Help me.

1:13:45.546 --> 1:13:46.754
Careful.

1:13:51.885 --> 1:13:53.553
He's under the living room.

1:13:56.807 --> 1:13:58.683
Richie, darling...

1:14:18.078 --> 1:14:19.912
Oh, shit!

1:14:20.038 --> 1:14:22.123
That scared me!

1:14:26.587 --> 1:14:28.254
Hello?

1:14:33.802 --> 1:14:36.512
- Who was it?
- I don't know. They hung up.

1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:01.871
Manuel, bastard!

1:15:01.997 --> 1:15:05.791
- Where have you been?
- Working, dear. How are you?

1:15:05.918 --> 1:15:09.754
- I'm getting there.
- Take it easy, huh?

1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:12.924
In a month, if all goes well,

1:15:13.050 --> 1:15:14.926
I'll be back
on the Enchant campaign.

1:15:15.052 --> 1:15:17.595
Enchant? Forget about that.

1:15:17.721 --> 1:15:18.804
What do you mean?

1:15:18.931 --> 1:15:21.599
Listen, the contract
with Enchant is finished.

1:15:23.185 --> 1:15:25.228
- They pulled out?
- What did you expect?

1:15:25.354 --> 1:15:27.772
They hired you when you were well.

1:15:27.898 --> 1:15:29.982
Be realistic, you're not well.

1:15:30.108 --> 1:15:32.693
When you get well, like before,

1:15:32.819 --> 1:15:36.113
we'll contact Enchant and it'll be fine...

1:16:03.976 --> 1:16:07.103
Jesus, Richie! Shit!

1:16:16.405 --> 1:16:17.655
Son of a bitch!

1:16:20.450 --> 1:16:22.118
Fuck you, Richie!

1:16:34.548 --> 1:16:37.550
My darling? Richie?

1:16:49.980 --> 1:16:52.064
The title goes higher,

1:16:52.190 --> 1:16:54.233
and the photo to the left.

1:16:55.986 --> 1:16:57.820
- Like that?
- A bit more.

1:16:57.946 --> 1:17:00.990
Or raise the photo
and bring the text down?

1:17:01.116 --> 1:17:03.784
No, that breaks the harmony.

1:17:04.661 --> 1:17:06.787
Mr. Estrada, telephone.

1:17:06.913 --> 1:17:09.749
Tell them I'll call back later.

1:17:09.875 --> 1:17:12.710
It seems urgent.
I think it's your wife.

1:17:14.296 --> 1:17:16.047
Excuse me.

1:17:20.594 --> 1:17:22.970
Julieta, what's the matter?

1:17:23.096 --> 1:17:24.555
Julieta, answer me.

1:17:24.681 --> 1:17:27.016
I'm not Julieta.

1:17:27.142 --> 1:17:30.102
Darling! I'm sorry, my secretary...

1:17:30.228 --> 1:17:32.021
What would you say to Julieta?

1:17:32.147 --> 1:17:35.941
- Nothing, it was a mistake.
- What would you say?

1:17:36.068 --> 1:17:38.903
- I swear.
- Well?

1:17:39.029 --> 1:17:41.697
This isn't like you. What's wrong?

1:17:45.786 --> 1:17:48.704
Valeria? My love?

1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:51.832
The rats ate Richie.

1:17:53.919 --> 1:17:55.961
What rats?

1:17:57.756 --> 1:17:59.590
What happened, honey?

1:18:02.344 --> 1:18:04.720
There are thousands
of rats down there.

1:18:07.182 --> 1:18:09.058
How do you know?

1:18:09.184 --> 1:18:12.853
I saw them. I'm sure they ate Richie.

1:18:12.979 --> 1:18:15.523
Don't worry.

1:18:15.649 --> 1:18:17.858
Rats don't eat dogs.

1:18:17.984 --> 1:18:20.111
They would get bitten.

1:18:20.237 --> 1:18:22.029
But there are thousands of them.

1:18:25.242 --> 1:18:28.119
We could put out some rat poison.

1:18:28.245 --> 1:18:30.871
Richie would eat it.

1:18:32.332 --> 1:18:34.625
We could send a cat down.

1:18:34.751 --> 1:18:36.544
A cat would fight with Richie.

1:18:36.670 --> 1:18:38.796
So what the fuck do we do?

1:18:48.932 --> 1:18:51.225
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.

1:18:54.521 --> 1:18:58.315
- Everything will be fine.
- You're not in my position.

1:18:59.651 --> 1:19:03.195
Look at my leg,
it'll be covered with scars.

1:19:03.321 --> 1:19:05.656
Plastic surgery has come a long way.

1:19:05.782 --> 1:19:08.200
You'll hardly see any scars...

1:19:08.326 --> 1:19:10.411
Don't fucking touch me!

1:19:21.506 --> 1:19:23.549
It's Richie!

1:19:27.637 --> 1:19:29.597
- Richie!
- He heard you shouting.

1:19:31.266 --> 1:19:32.475
It's him!

1:19:39.900 --> 1:19:42.818
- I know!
- Where are you going?

1:19:45.030 --> 1:19:48.032
If I make it bigger, he'll come out.

1:19:48.158 --> 1:19:50.326
The rats will come out!

1:19:50.452 --> 1:19:51.911
They didn't come out before,

1:19:52.037 --> 1:19:54.705
I don't know
why they'd come out now.

1:19:54.831 --> 1:19:57.708
Make the hole as big as you can.

1:19:59.002 --> 1:20:00.252
Shit! Richie!

1:20:06.176 --> 1:20:08.093
Hello?

1:20:09.387 --> 1:20:13.098
Who's there?
Fuck your mother!

1:20:17.521 --> 1:20:19.021
Who was that, Daniel?

1:20:19.898 --> 1:20:21.982
No idea.

1:20:23.944 --> 1:20:26.195
When I used to call,
you knew it was me.

1:20:26.321 --> 1:20:28.239
So who is it?

1:20:28.365 --> 1:20:30.658
I don't know, OK?

1:21:02.315 --> 1:21:04.400
Valeria, what's the matter?

1:21:05.527 --> 1:21:08.070
My leg really hurts.

1:21:08.196 --> 1:21:11.574
- I can't stand it.
- We're going to the hospital.

1:21:11.700 --> 1:21:13.701
No, I talked to the doctor.

1:21:15.245 --> 1:21:18.414
He said it's normal for it to hurt.

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:21.667
But it feels like it's going to burst.

1:21:23.378 --> 1:21:25.796
Did he prescribe anything?

1:21:25.922 --> 1:21:29.258
Tranquilizers
and an anti-inflammatory.

1:21:30.635 --> 1:21:32.511
What can I do?

1:21:33.555 --> 1:21:35.514
Hold me.

1:22:25.815 --> 1:22:27.566
SEE YOU SOON

1:23:01.559 --> 1:23:03.602
I'm going to squeeze a little.

1:23:11.194 --> 1:23:13.821
- Did you walk on it?
- A little.

1:23:28.753 --> 1:23:30.254
Got the X-rays?

1:23:41.307 --> 1:23:42.349
Well...

1:23:43.643 --> 1:23:46.103
You can get dressed, Valeria.

1:23:46.229 --> 1:23:48.605
Margarita, help her.

1:23:48.732 --> 1:23:50.649
Come, there's no room here.

1:23:57.115 --> 1:23:59.950
Want to order take-out,
or rent a movie?

1:24:01.077 --> 1:24:03.746
I'm not in the mood.
I feel lousy.

1:24:03.872 --> 1:24:05.664
You're going to be fine.

1:24:06.750 --> 1:24:09.752
Goddamn it!
Is that all you can say?

1:24:27.395 --> 1:24:28.479
Daniel...

1:24:30.940 --> 1:24:32.691
It's Richie!

1:24:32.817 --> 1:24:34.610
He's whining, listen.

1:24:36.196 --> 1:24:37.905
Listen, it's him!

1:24:39.157 --> 1:24:40.741
Get him out.

1:24:41.659 --> 1:24:44.870
- How?
- Tear up the floor or something!

1:24:44.996 --> 1:24:48.791
I can't tear it up.
I don't have the money to fix it...

1:24:48.917 --> 1:24:50.834
Money doesn't matter!

1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:53.253
It does right now.

1:24:53.379 --> 1:24:55.464
- Get him out!
- He can get himself out!

1:24:55.590 --> 1:24:58.842
You faggot!
You've always been selfish!

1:24:58.968 --> 1:25:01.428
I gave up everything for you!

1:25:01.554 --> 1:25:05.099
Yeah, your bitchy wife
and your stupid daughters!

1:25:05.225 --> 1:25:07.017
Shut up or I'll hit you!

1:25:07.143 --> 1:25:10.854
- You piece of shit!
- Go fuck yourself!

1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:12.898
You and that stupid dog!

1:25:13.024 --> 1:25:15.692
You fucking asshole,
drop dead!

1:25:16.236 --> 1:25:17.945
Drop dead, fucker!

1:25:18.071 --> 1:25:19.613
Fucker!

1:26:01.614 --> 1:26:04.324
I'll be back around 2:00.

1:26:04.450 --> 1:26:06.743
I don't care
if you never come back.

1:26:39.986 --> 1:26:45.532
Hello?

1:26:49.579 --> 1:26:51.288
Daniel?

1:26:54.375 --> 1:27:00.255
Sweetheart?

1:27:26.574 --> 1:27:29.034
Valeria, open the door.

1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:31.411
Open up, damn it!

1:27:31.537 --> 1:27:34.164
Valeria, open up!

1:27:34.290 --> 1:27:36.375
Open up, Valeria!

1:28:13.579 --> 1:28:15.747
Valeria, please.

1:28:16.582 --> 1:28:19.710
I have nothing to apologize for,
but all right, I'm sorry.

1:28:20.962 --> 1:28:22.462
OK now?

1:28:24.716 --> 1:28:27.634
Valeria, open up or I'll do it myself.

1:28:29.637 --> 1:28:32.848
On the count of three,
I'm breaking it down.

1:28:35.852 --> 1:28:37.728
One...

1:28:38.604 --> 1:28:40.022
two...

1:28:41.607 --> 1:28:43.483
two and a quarter...

1:28:45.069 --> 1:28:47.029
two and a half...

1:28:48.239 --> 1:28:50.532
two and three-quarters...

1:28:51.617 --> 1:28:53.410
Shit!

1:28:59.167 --> 1:29:00.500
Valeria.

1:29:00.626 --> 1:29:02.461
What happened, honey?

1:29:02.587 --> 1:29:04.171
Valeria.

1:29:08.885 --> 1:29:11.595
Valeria, don't do this to me, please!

1:29:15.099 --> 1:29:16.767
We have to...

1:29:40.041 --> 1:29:41.249
How is she?

1:29:42.043 --> 1:29:46.421
She had severe arterial thrombosis,
which affected the tissues.

1:29:47.799 --> 1:29:50.801
We should have intervened earlier.

1:29:50.927 --> 1:29:52.344
There is a lot of damage.

1:29:53.429 --> 1:29:56.014
No blood could get to the muscles.

1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:57.474
And?

1:29:57.600 --> 1:30:00.769
Advanced gangrene set in...

1:30:02.188 --> 1:30:04.481
and I had to amputate the leg.

1:30:08.361 --> 1:30:10.195
I'm sorry, Daniel.

1:31:22.977 --> 1:31:24.436
Shit!

1:33:51.959 --> 1:33:56.671
SPACE AVAILABLE

1:34:15.858 --> 1:34:21.237
El Chivo And Maru

1:34:28.079 --> 1:34:29.704
Hello?

1:34:29.830 --> 1:34:31.164
Yes.

1:34:32.833 --> 1:34:35.085
Tell him 3:00.

1:34:35.211 --> 1:34:36.961
Cancel the other one.

1:34:39.799 --> 1:34:43.093
When we get to the house,
turn that shit off.

1:34:43.219 --> 1:34:44.928
He hates that crap.

1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:50.100
Why do we need 40 sandwiches?

1:34:50.226 --> 1:34:52.727
It's a gift for a friend, OK?

1:34:55.606 --> 1:34:57.857
Sure your friend will do a good job?

1:34:58.984 --> 1:35:00.777
I told you 20 times he will.

1:35:03.489 --> 1:35:06.574
Who is this friend?
Is he a cop too?

1:35:06.701 --> 1:35:09.244
No, he was locked up
for 20 years.

1:35:10.663 --> 1:35:12.038
What for?

1:35:12.164 --> 1:35:13.123
He was a guerrilla.

1:35:13.249 --> 1:35:15.625
Like the Zapatistas?

1:35:16.794 --> 1:35:21.506
That's right,
only he was a real son of a bitch.

1:35:21.632 --> 1:35:23.675
He planted a bomb in a mall,

1:35:23.801 --> 1:35:25.218
kidnapped a banker,

1:35:25.344 --> 1:35:26.678
killed cops...

1:35:26.804 --> 1:35:28.263
Turn here.

1:35:29.181 --> 1:35:32.142
He had an army after him,
the White Brigade.

1:35:33.644 --> 1:35:34.644
You know who got him?

1:35:35.396 --> 1:35:37.272
- Who?
- Me!

1:35:39.859 --> 1:35:42.694
I caught him pissing
at Sanborn's Cafe!

1:35:45.823 --> 1:35:47.657
Can you believe that?

1:35:47.783 --> 1:35:49.159
Hello?

1:35:50.244 --> 1:35:51.286
No.

1:35:52.037 --> 1:35:55.248
Deposit that money in my account.

1:35:57.668 --> 1:36:00.128
I'll transfer it. Bye.

1:36:04.216 --> 1:36:06.176
What do I say to him?

1:36:06.302 --> 1:36:08.511
Nothing. I'll do the talking.

1:36:08.637 --> 1:36:11.055
Don't ask personal questions.

1:36:11.182 --> 1:36:12.432
Why not?

1:36:12.558 --> 1:36:14.017
It pisses him off.

1:36:14.143 --> 1:36:16.853
He was a normal guy,
like you and me.

1:36:18.981 --> 1:36:22.692
He was a college teacher,
and one day, boom!

1:36:22.818 --> 1:36:25.904
He dumps his wife and daughter
and becomes a guerrilla.

1:36:27.072 --> 1:36:29.157
- And his family?
- What do you think?

1:36:29.283 --> 1:36:30.909
They told him to go to hell!

1:36:31.035 --> 1:36:32.410
His wife remarried.

1:36:32.536 --> 1:36:34.913
I guess his daughter
thinks he's dead.

1:36:36.290 --> 1:36:39.334
When he got out of the can,
he went fucking nuts.

1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:43.880
When I found him, he was a wino.

1:36:44.006 --> 1:36:45.381
I felt sorry for him.

1:36:46.509 --> 1:36:48.134
I gave him some cash
and a place to live.

1:36:48.260 --> 1:36:51.638
We even became pals.
He started doing jobs for me.

1:36:53.766 --> 1:36:56.434
Jobs... like this one?

1:36:56.560 --> 1:36:58.186
Yeah.

1:37:00.314 --> 1:37:01.981
I'll get it.

1:37:05.986 --> 1:37:07.320
Why did you do that?

1:37:07.446 --> 1:37:08.947
You'll buy another one!

1:37:28.801 --> 1:37:30.093
What's up, Chivito?

1:37:30.636 --> 1:37:32.303
What's up, Leonardo?

1:37:33.472 --> 1:37:34.889
You all right?

1:37:35.015 --> 1:37:38.184
Meet my friend, Gustavo Garfias.

1:37:40.604 --> 1:37:43.273
- Hello, brother.
- Pleased to meet you.

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:46.067
This is for you.

1:37:48.612 --> 1:37:50.113
Great!

1:37:51.991 --> 1:37:53.241
Cool.

1:38:08.007 --> 1:38:11.342
No chilli, no onion. Perfect!

1:38:12.386 --> 1:38:13.803
Thanks.

1:38:16.557 --> 1:38:17.974
Sit there.

1:38:22.688 --> 1:38:25.481
Did you lose your glasses?

1:38:26.442 --> 1:38:28.526
I stopped using them.

1:38:28.652 --> 1:38:30.653
If God wants me to see blurry,

1:38:30.779 --> 1:38:32.322
I'll see blurry.

1:38:36.785 --> 1:38:38.661
My friend Gustavo needs a favour.

1:38:40.164 --> 1:38:41.456
The photograph.

1:38:45.544 --> 1:38:47.795
I don't do that anymore.

1:38:47.922 --> 1:38:49.672
I told you last time.

1:38:50.633 --> 1:38:52.091
Come on.

1:38:52.217 --> 1:38:54.260
How are you going to live?
On trash?

1:38:55.888 --> 1:38:58.348
Trash provides, Leonardo.

1:38:58.474 --> 1:38:59.682
Really.

1:38:59.808 --> 1:39:02.518
Look, a Citizen.

1:39:02.645 --> 1:39:06.564
I found it in the dumpster.
This, too.

1:39:06.690 --> 1:39:09.192
Don't bullshit me.

1:39:09.318 --> 1:39:11.611
You stole it!

1:39:12.112 --> 1:39:13.237
No, I found it.

1:39:14.114 --> 1:39:16.741
The Commander says
you are very good.

1:39:21.121 --> 1:39:22.497
Good at what?

1:39:23.916 --> 1:39:27.043
Come on, take it. Don't fuck around.

1:39:31.590 --> 1:39:33.007
Who is he?

1:39:37.721 --> 1:39:39.138
My partner.

1:39:39.765 --> 1:39:41.265
What did he do?

1:39:42.851 --> 1:39:44.268
He's cheating me.

1:39:45.396 --> 1:39:47.730
How much are you paying?

1:39:47.856 --> 1:39:51.275
50,000 now, 50,000 after.

1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:55.405
100 now,

1:39:55.531 --> 1:39:56.948
50 after.

1:39:57.825 --> 1:39:59.409
Done?

1:40:00.327 --> 1:40:02.537
OK, but I only have 50 on me.

1:40:09.294 --> 1:40:12.463
- His name?
- Luis Miranda Solares.

1:40:12.589 --> 1:40:15.258
He lives at 1460 Sierra de Maika.

1:40:15.384 --> 1:40:17.343
He works on Montes Urales Street.

1:40:19.471 --> 1:40:21.431
Real blue collar, huh!

1:40:29.356 --> 1:40:30.398
All right.

1:40:35.446 --> 1:40:37.864
Make it look like a robbery.

1:40:37.990 --> 1:40:40.074
No people, no trouble...

1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:41.951
Of course, brother.

1:40:42.077 --> 1:40:44.787
No people, no trouble, no shit.

1:45:37.539 --> 1:45:40.291
Richie!
What's the matter?

1:46:14.493 --> 1:46:17.161
Help me, shit!
Help me!

1:46:17.287 --> 1:46:18.454
The door's stuck.

1:46:19.206 --> 1:46:21.207
I've got a machete in my cart.

1:46:26.296 --> 1:46:27.463
Call an ambulance!

1:46:30.092 --> 1:46:31.926
Hang on.

1:46:34.638 --> 1:46:37.223
Stay calm, stay calm.

1:46:41.728 --> 1:46:43.062
Move aside.

1:46:43.814 --> 1:46:45.648
- What is it?
- His foot is stuck.

1:46:47.734 --> 1:46:49.610
Calm down!

1:46:50.695 --> 1:46:54.240
Calm down!
Careful with his leg.

1:46:54.366 --> 1:46:55.783
Keep still, kid!

1:47:02.541 --> 1:47:04.375
The other kid?

1:47:09.005 --> 1:47:11.257
He's dead already!

1:47:15.470 --> 1:47:16.971
An ambulance! Christ!

1:47:29.484 --> 1:47:32.027
Calm down, you'll be right out.

1:47:32.154 --> 1:47:36.407
Open the window.
Try to open it!

1:47:36.533 --> 1:47:37.992
They're here.

1:47:42.038 --> 1:47:44.457
Keep away!
Let him breathe!

1:47:45.125 --> 1:47:46.542
Can you hear me?

1:47:46.668 --> 1:47:48.127
The window!

1:47:48.253 --> 1:47:49.462
There!

1:47:49.588 --> 1:47:52.047
Help me, please!

1:47:52.174 --> 1:47:53.883
Lower!

1:47:54.968 --> 1:47:57.720
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

1:47:57.846 --> 1:48:00.890
We'll get you out.

1:48:01.016 --> 1:48:02.975
Her leg's stuck.

1:48:32.214 --> 1:48:35.216
Easy! Easy!

1:48:54.986 --> 1:48:57.404
Hang in there, champ.

1:49:05.747 --> 1:49:07.456
What did they do to you?

1:49:09.626 --> 1:49:10.668
Hang on, boy.

1:49:12.712 --> 1:49:15.756
Good, you're very brave.

1:49:15.882 --> 1:49:18.092
That's it, champ!

1:49:18.218 --> 1:49:19.843
That's it, boy.

1:50:49.809 --> 1:50:52.519
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Putting on my hood!

1:50:52.646 --> 1:50:56.315
Why not wear a sign saying
"Bank Robber"?

1:50:56.441 --> 1:50:58.317
For banks, you don't wear anything!

1:50:58.443 --> 1:51:00.861
What? Just my stupid face?

1:51:00.987 --> 1:51:02.780
You decide.

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:11.455
Hit the floor, you motherfuckers!

1:51:13.291 --> 1:51:15.459
This is a stickup!

1:51:15.585 --> 1:51:17.628
This is a stickup, assholes!

1:51:17.754 --> 1:51:19.713
Everyone on the floor!

1:51:19.839 --> 1:51:21.382
What are you looking at?

1:51:21.508 --> 1:51:23.133
Right now!

1:51:23.259 --> 1:51:24.968
On the floor!

1:51:25.095 --> 1:51:26.470
You, too!

1:51:26.596 --> 1:51:28.305
I'm talking to you!

1:51:28.431 --> 1:51:31.642
- Give me your wallet!
- Take it yourself.

1:51:31.768 --> 1:51:33.268
Don't look at me!

1:51:39.317 --> 1:51:40.818
On the floor!

1:51:46.241 --> 1:51:49.743
Don't move, drop the gun!

1:51:50.620 --> 1:51:51.870
Get down!

1:52:06.302 --> 1:52:07.678
Easy...

1:52:28.867 --> 1:52:31.368
Leave him alone.

1:52:31.494 --> 1:52:33.078
Lobo, get lost.

1:52:33.204 --> 1:52:35.622
Good boy.

1:52:45.717 --> 1:52:48.385
Very good. It's healed.

1:53:35.350 --> 1:53:37.184
What brings you here, Leo?

1:53:37.310 --> 1:53:39.353
Just passing by.

1:53:40.939 --> 1:53:44.024
You're taking your time.
It's been a week.

1:53:44.150 --> 1:53:45.776
It's not easy.

1:53:45.902 --> 1:53:47.611
It never is, is it?

1:53:48.363 --> 1:53:50.948
Tell your friend to keep cool.

1:53:51.074 --> 1:53:53.617
It'll be done in two days.

1:53:53.743 --> 1:53:56.912
I've got your word, Chivo?

1:53:57.038 --> 1:53:58.539
I've got to go to the bank.

1:56:47.417 --> 1:56:49.584
- I watched your car!
- Sure...

1:56:49.711 --> 1:56:53.088
I was leaning on the car.

1:56:53.214 --> 1:56:56.216
No, he went to play soccer!

1:56:57.677 --> 1:56:59.553
For both of you.

1:57:26.539 --> 1:57:28.373
My condolences, Dona Concha.

1:57:48.811 --> 1:57:50.103
Are you all right?

1:57:53.232 --> 1:57:54.691
Not as bad as I was.

1:57:59.697 --> 1:58:01.156
Why did you leave?

1:58:02.658 --> 1:58:04.534
Now's not the time to talk about it.

1:58:07.872 --> 1:58:09.664
Then when?

1:58:39.112 --> 1:58:41.530
Ramiro was my husband, wasn't he?

1:58:41.656 --> 1:58:43.740
And what about our plans?

1:58:43.866 --> 1:58:45.325
Your plans.

1:58:46.619 --> 1:58:48.370
My grandmother used to say,

1:58:48.496 --> 1:58:51.665
"To make God laugh,
tell Him your plans".

1:58:53.501 --> 1:58:55.168
- You wronged me, Susana.
- No.

1:58:55.294 --> 1:58:59.631
No, Octavio. We were the ones
who cheated.

1:58:59.757 --> 1:59:01.675
But not anymore.

1:59:03.594 --> 1:59:04.970
Come away with me.

1:59:06.097 --> 1:59:07.806
How dare you?

1:59:08.808 --> 1:59:10.892
After everything that's happened?

1:59:15.064 --> 1:59:17.983
- You still don't get it!
- Yes, I do.

1:59:19.318 --> 1:59:22.487
God can laugh,
but I still have my plans.

1:59:24.365 --> 1:59:26.700
Sunday at 11:00,
I leave for Ciudad Juarez.

1:59:27.702 --> 1:59:30.370
You've really lost it! Look at you!

1:59:30.496 --> 1:59:32.372
I don't give a fuck!

1:59:35.126 --> 1:59:36.835
Now you know everything.

1:59:38.921 --> 1:59:40.589
I'll wait for you.

1:59:44.468 --> 1:59:46.553
You decide if you want to come.

1:59:47.805 --> 1:59:49.598
Do you get me now?

1:59:51.434 --> 1:59:53.018
Ramiro...

1:59:54.729 --> 1:59:56.730
the baby's name will be Ramiro.

2:00:17.293 --> 2:00:19.336
Feeling better?

2:00:28.888 --> 2:00:30.764
What happened to you?

2:00:59.377 --> 2:01:01.711
Flor?

2:01:05.216 --> 2:01:06.716
Don't die on me!

2:01:06.842 --> 2:01:09.552
Answer me, baby!

2:01:14.725 --> 2:01:16.685
Frijol?

2:01:45.298 --> 2:01:49.926
It's not right, asshole!

2:02:10.656 --> 2:02:13.783
Gringuita? My baby?

2:02:19.623 --> 2:02:21.166
Hang in there.

2:05:43.452 --> 2:05:45.703
Look straight ahead of you.

2:05:47.248 --> 2:05:48.748
Don't look at me.

2:05:48.874 --> 2:05:50.375
Open the door.

2:05:50.501 --> 2:05:52.126
No stupid moves.

2:05:52.711 --> 2:05:55.713
- Don't turn around.
- Stay cool.

2:06:00.302 --> 2:06:01.761
Move aside.

2:06:05.641 --> 2:06:07.016
Cuff your left hand.

2:06:09.353 --> 2:06:10.937
The right one to the wheel.

2:06:12.273 --> 2:06:14.899
Cuff it to the wheel, dickhead!

2:06:18.445 --> 2:06:19.487
Start the car.

2:06:26.161 --> 2:06:27.704
Let's go.

2:06:32.084 --> 2:06:33.251
What is this?

2:06:34.378 --> 2:06:35.628
Robbery or kidnapping?

2:06:35.754 --> 2:06:37.839
Maybe the last day of your life.

2:06:41.594 --> 2:06:43.469
I was paid to blow you away, brother.

2:06:44.888 --> 2:06:46.514
How about that?

2:06:53.731 --> 2:06:56.107
Stand still. On your knees.

2:06:57.985 --> 2:06:59.319
On the floor.

2:06:59.445 --> 2:07:00.862
Your hand.

2:07:03.282 --> 2:07:04.365
Sit.

2:07:06.952 --> 2:07:08.578
Lean there. Your hand, I said.

2:07:22.593 --> 2:07:23.926
Want a drink?

2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:26.262
I've got rum,

2:07:26.388 --> 2:07:28.348
water...

2:07:28.474 --> 2:07:29.974
or milk.

2:07:34.647 --> 2:07:37.982
- What will you do to me?
- What do you want?

2:07:38.108 --> 2:07:41.110
Rum, water or milk?

2:07:42.446 --> 2:07:44.739
My question couldn't be clearer.

2:07:45.866 --> 2:07:48.576
Look, asshole,

2:07:48.702 --> 2:07:51.371
I'm offering you a drink.

2:07:51.497 --> 2:07:53.790
If you had any sense,

2:07:53.916 --> 2:07:56.209
even a little bit,

2:07:56.335 --> 2:07:59.128
you'd realize
I'm not going to kill you

2:07:59.254 --> 2:08:00.755
just now, dickhead.

2:08:02.007 --> 2:08:04.384
Rum, water or milk?

2:08:07.554 --> 2:08:08.888
Water.

2:08:21.819 --> 2:08:23.319
Cheers!

2:08:25.322 --> 2:08:26.656
How do I drink it?

2:08:26.782 --> 2:08:29.617
I'll be the waiter,
but not your nanny.

2:08:33.205 --> 2:08:35.456
Who paid you to kill me?

2:08:35.582 --> 2:08:36.999
Can't you guess?

2:08:37.126 --> 2:08:39.085
No.

2:08:39.211 --> 2:08:44.507
What if I told you it was the chick
you fuck daily in that motel?

2:08:46.802 --> 2:08:48.428
Marta?

2:08:51.098 --> 2:08:52.390
No.

2:08:53.559 --> 2:08:55.101
It can't be.

2:08:55.227 --> 2:08:57.228
Right. Not her.

2:08:58.731 --> 2:09:00.356
Your wife.

2:09:05.195 --> 2:09:06.821
My wife?

2:09:09.867 --> 2:09:13.202
- She knows about Marta?
- I don't know. Does she?

2:09:16.498 --> 2:09:19.292
No, man. It's not her, either.

2:09:26.175 --> 2:09:27.675
Marta's husband?

2:09:30.721 --> 2:09:32.638
She's married? I'll be damned!

2:09:33.682 --> 2:09:35.308
Shit, brother!

2:09:36.268 --> 2:09:40.062
A lot of people want to kill you.

2:09:41.023 --> 2:09:42.565
You know what?

2:09:43.984 --> 2:09:45.485
My dog's got no name.

2:09:46.695 --> 2:09:49.989
I found him in the street.
What would you call him?

2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:55.328
How about "Lost Dog"?

2:09:56.413 --> 2:09:58.581
Some imagination!

2:09:58.707 --> 2:10:00.208
You must be in advertising.

2:10:01.502 --> 2:10:03.920
I was thinking, maybe Gustavo...

2:10:04.671 --> 2:10:06.088
Gustavo?

2:10:07.841 --> 2:10:09.467
Know any Gustavos?

2:10:10.427 --> 2:10:12.053
My brother.

2:10:13.138 --> 2:10:14.639
Gustavo Garfias.

2:10:15.933 --> 2:10:17.600
Gustavo Miranda Garfias.

2:10:21.063 --> 2:10:22.647
He's my half brother.

2:10:25.359 --> 2:10:27.485
Abel, Abel!

2:10:28.529 --> 2:10:32.740
What did you do to deserve
a brother like that?

2:10:34.117 --> 2:10:36.494
He said he's your partner.

2:10:39.373 --> 2:10:41.833
Partner and half-brother.

2:10:45.587 --> 2:10:49.257
- Was it him?
- I don't know. You tell me.

2:10:53.554 --> 2:10:56.264
- How much?
- 5,000 pesos.

2:10:57.850 --> 2:11:01.102
Only 5,000 fucking pesos!

2:11:01.228 --> 2:11:03.145
And...

2:11:03.272 --> 2:11:05.147
tickets to the Rolling Stones.

2:11:05.274 --> 2:11:07.358
That son of a fucking bitch!

2:11:09.570 --> 2:11:12.029
Why? What did I do to him?

2:11:12.155 --> 2:11:13.406
Says you're screwing him.

2:11:13.532 --> 2:11:16.534
No fucking way! He's my brother!

2:11:16.660 --> 2:11:19.745
Easy, man. That's what he says.

2:11:23.667 --> 2:11:27.461
Quit yelling or I'll have
to fill you with lead.

2:11:29.506 --> 2:11:32.216
So, what do we call him?

2:11:36.054 --> 2:11:38.848
Who cares about your fucking dog?

2:11:38.974 --> 2:11:40.725
Don't be rude!

2:11:40.851 --> 2:11:44.020
Masters take after their dogs,
you know.

2:11:44.146 --> 2:11:46.439
And... how do I put it?

2:11:47.608 --> 2:11:50.234
If it weren't for him, you'd be dead.

2:11:54.615 --> 2:11:56.616
Easy, easy.

2:11:57.826 --> 2:11:59.660
I'll be in my room watching TV.

2:11:59.786 --> 2:12:02.997
If you need anything at all,

2:12:03.123 --> 2:12:04.999
just shout.

2:12:31.944 --> 2:12:33.402
Good morning.

2:12:42.329 --> 2:12:43.704
What's up, brother?

2:12:44.706 --> 2:12:46.332
Got a good night's sleep?

2:13:00.430 --> 2:13:01.764
What manners!

2:13:03.850 --> 2:13:05.226
What will you do to me?

2:13:05.936 --> 2:13:07.687
I don't know. I'm thinking.

2:13:09.690 --> 2:13:11.107
If you let me go...

2:13:12.317 --> 2:13:14.026
I'll make you rich.

2:13:17.489 --> 2:13:20.700
Kill my brother, and I'll give you
anything you want.

2:13:21.994 --> 2:13:24.829
I don't need anything.
Amazing, huh?

2:13:26.957 --> 2:13:29.125
I have to go. See you later.

2:13:30.293 --> 2:13:32.169
I need to go to the bathroom.

2:13:33.213 --> 2:13:35.923
You already have.

2:13:36.049 --> 2:13:38.384
Look at you!

2:13:38.510 --> 2:13:40.428
You should have told me!

2:13:42.597 --> 2:13:43.931
See you later.

2:13:44.891 --> 2:13:46.350
Watch him for me.

2:14:48.789 --> 2:14:50.915
- Hello?
- Got my money?

2:14:53.085 --> 2:14:54.919
Did you notice?
He wasn't at work today.

2:14:55.879 --> 2:14:56.921
Did you do it?

2:14:57.047 --> 2:15:00.341
Bring the money to my place
in two hours.

2:15:00.467 --> 2:15:02.009
Don't keep me waiting.

2:15:17.317 --> 2:15:20.027
Did you lock it, brother?

2:15:20.153 --> 2:15:21.612
Cars get stolen around here.

2:15:23.406 --> 2:15:25.032
This won't be long, will it?

2:15:27.285 --> 2:15:29.078
Here's what we agreed to.

2:15:32.833 --> 2:15:33.999
Come in.

2:15:34.709 --> 2:15:36.544
- I'd better go.
- Come in.

2:15:42.509 --> 2:15:44.093
What's the matter?

2:15:45.178 --> 2:15:47.930
- It's all there.
- It's cool.

2:15:48.056 --> 2:15:49.473
Come with me.

2:15:55.605 --> 2:15:57.022
In here.

2:16:12.998 --> 2:16:14.415
Have you two met?

2:16:22.048 --> 2:16:24.925
This wasn't the deal.

2:16:25.051 --> 2:16:26.260
What was the deal?

2:16:26.386 --> 2:16:28.804
- You were going to...
- Going to what, brother?

2:16:28.930 --> 2:16:30.431
What!?

2:16:33.059 --> 2:16:35.561
- That was your job!
- "Job"?

2:16:35.687 --> 2:16:39.607
I misunderstood.
You wanted him off the map?

2:16:39.733 --> 2:16:41.108
Do it yourself.

2:16:41.234 --> 2:16:44.361
He's all yours, fucking Cain.

2:16:46.364 --> 2:16:49.074
Kill him, you faggot, he's all yours!

2:16:52.037 --> 2:16:53.454
I paid you...

2:16:54.706 --> 2:16:56.999
I paid you to do it.
That was the deal!

2:16:57.125 --> 2:16:59.251
You're not going to?

2:17:00.629 --> 2:17:02.046
You want me to?

2:17:03.256 --> 2:17:07.509
Do I kill him?

2:17:07.636 --> 2:17:08.928
Answer me!

2:17:09.054 --> 2:17:10.804
Do I kill him?

2:17:13.308 --> 2:17:14.975
Or do I kill you?

2:17:17.270 --> 2:17:18.646
Do I kill him?

2:17:18.772 --> 2:17:20.689
Do you really want me to?

2:17:22.484 --> 2:17:23.817
Fucking faggot!

2:17:59.854 --> 2:18:02.356
So, you coming or staying?

2:20:38.555 --> 2:20:39.972
Good morning.

2:20:42.559 --> 2:20:43.976
Sleep well?

2:20:46.104 --> 2:20:48.480
You must have a lot to chat about.

2:20:48.606 --> 2:20:51.733
Pity I can't stay,
it would be fascinating.

2:20:56.823 --> 2:21:00.492
But as you might guess,
I have to leave town.

2:21:01.619 --> 2:21:03.162
That's how it works.

2:21:10.128 --> 2:21:11.545
Make yourselves at home.

2:21:12.797 --> 2:21:15.674
I hope you'll work things out.

2:21:19.888 --> 2:21:21.763
What are you looking at?

2:21:28.438 --> 2:21:31.648
On the other hand,
if talking doesn't work,

2:21:32.692 --> 2:21:35.486
I'll leave you this
to help settle things.

2:21:35.612 --> 2:21:37.029
OK?

2:21:38.239 --> 2:21:40.532
I'll call to see how things went.

2:21:42.619 --> 2:21:44.369
Nice jacket.

2:21:45.705 --> 2:21:48.957
There's milk and eggs in the fridge,
if you want breakfast.

2:22:05.350 --> 2:22:07.184
You're dead, you bastard!

2:24:44.926 --> 2:24:48.887
Hello.
This is 55445850.

2:24:49.013 --> 2:24:52.641
I can't take your call right now,
but leave a message and a number,

2:24:52.767 --> 2:24:55.727
and I'll get back to you.
Thank you.

2:25:28.052 --> 2:25:29.511
Maru...

2:25:31.013 --> 2:25:32.681
my darling...

2:25:34.434 --> 2:25:36.101
This is Martin.

2:25:37.729 --> 2:25:39.187
Your dad...

2:25:40.690 --> 2:25:42.274
your real dad.

2:25:45.111 --> 2:25:48.947
You must think
this is a sick joke.

2:25:49.073 --> 2:25:53.410
For all these years,
I've been dead to you.

2:25:54.954 --> 2:25:57.330
In fact...

2:25:57.457 --> 2:25:59.249
I'm a living ghost.

2:26:06.090 --> 2:26:08.467
When I saw you last...

2:26:08.593 --> 2:26:10.802
you were only two.

2:26:12.889 --> 2:26:16.933
Since then, not a day passes
that I don't think of you.

2:26:19.395 --> 2:26:21.229
The afternoon I went away...

2:26:25.693 --> 2:26:27.486
I held you very tight.

2:26:30.490 --> 2:26:32.157
I took you in my arms...

2:26:32.283 --> 2:26:34.743
I begged forgiveness
for what I was going to do.

2:26:36.829 --> 2:26:38.580
At the time,

2:26:38.706 --> 2:26:41.291
I thought there were
more important things

2:26:41.417 --> 2:26:43.752
than being with you and your mom.

2:26:43.878 --> 2:26:47.088
I wanted to set the world right,

2:26:47.215 --> 2:26:48.882
and then share it with you.

2:26:51.260 --> 2:26:52.844
I failed, as you can see.

2:26:56.390 --> 2:26:57.849
I wound up in jail.

2:26:59.852 --> 2:27:04.147
Your mother and I agreed
she would tell you... I'd died.

2:27:04.273 --> 2:27:06.107
That was my idea, not hers.

2:27:08.319 --> 2:27:10.779
I swore to her I'd never try
to see you again...

2:27:12.865 --> 2:27:14.533
but I couldn't do it.

2:27:21.499 --> 2:27:25.335
I was dying, I was as dead
as I could be.

2:27:27.421 --> 2:27:29.339
I'll be back to find you...

2:27:30.925 --> 2:27:33.885
once I have the courage
to look you in the eyes.

2:27:35.137 --> 2:27:38.223
I love you, my little girl.

2:28:15.595 --> 2:28:17.345
What's your dog called?

2:28:20.349 --> 2:28:22.267
Blackie.

2:28:24.228 --> 2:28:25.854
Shut up, Blackie!

2:28:25.980 --> 2:28:28.023
- See you around.
- Bye.

2:29:27.333 --> 2:29:31.670
For Luciano, because we are also
what we have lost.
