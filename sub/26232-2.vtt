00:27.819 --> 00:30.072
[man] You should take a picture with me.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.740
<i>-</i>[man] <i>Se√±or.</i>
-No, thank you.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.867
-Buddy, how about a photo?
-No, thank you.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.118
-Come on.
-No, thank you.

00:35.244 --> 00:38.205
-What's the rush? Have a little fun.
-Go choke on a carrot.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.457

00:49.258 --> 00:51.176

00:51.260 --> 00:53.887

-[door knocking]
-Hello?

00:55.847 --> 00:58.392
-[Man] Mister Monte?
-Yeah?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.894
[armchair screeches]

01:01.228 --> 01:03.230
[TV dialogue continues]

01:04.731 --> 01:06.441
[laughes]

01:06.567 --> 01:07.943
You can't be serious.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.529
You guys are getting really aggressive.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.823
I can call the cops, you know.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.950
[bunny cocks gun] Back it up, Al.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.494
[Monte] Jesus, what do you want?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.956
[bunny] Step away from the window.

01:22.874 --> 01:23.709
You want money?

01:24.376 --> 01:26.795
-Back it up.
-I got money. Lemme just get to my wallet.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.007
[Monte] How much you want?
I got plenty of money.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.719
Jesus! What do you want?
What, what did I do?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.137
-[bunny] Right there.
-No.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.055
[Monte grunts and thumps on lamp]

01:39.558 --> 01:40.851
[Tony Sr.] Ten bucks says

01:41.143 --> 01:43.729
my King's keeping better company
than your King.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.063
[Tony Jr.] I fold.

01:46.023 --> 01:49.234
What's the matter? You're supposed
to be able to tell when a man's bluffing.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.485
You're a detective now.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.322
That's right. You're a detective now.
Show us the shield.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.657
[chattering]

01:55.741 --> 01:57.743
[cheering]

01:58.243 --> 02:00.829
-Okay.
-Yeah, it's a beautiful piece of metal.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.040
Are you in, or are you out?

02:03.206 --> 02:06.877
You know... I wasn't sure until...
just now.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.503
I call.

02:09.504 --> 02:10.922
And raise you five.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.884
[Tony Sr.]Take it. Go ahead.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.637
[Cora]
Now the rest of your money, I say hello,

02:16.720 --> 02:18.138
and we'll be together soon.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.931
[Tony Jr.]No. Wait...

02:20.390 --> 02:22.643
That's a forfeit.
You can't call and then raise.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.227
That's called a string bet.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.063
And that's an infraction.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.230
[Burl] You're an infraction.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.066
You break one rule, they all break.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.693
You ever wonder
why you're not invited to more parties?

02:31.818 --> 02:35.656
Okay. Alright, fine. You know what?
Since we're making up rules,

02:35.906 --> 02:37.783
I've decided it's nine cards or draw,

02:37.949 --> 02:40.494
and, TJ's rules, fives are wild.

02:40.952 --> 02:44.122
[man] Let's see what I got here.
I don't want this four. I prefer your...

02:44.206 --> 02:45.082
Guys...

02:45.415 --> 02:48.001
You know who that is?
That's what's her name, the model.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.920
She's super famous.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.799
Don't turn around, be cool.
Just be cool.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.427
Belinda Mannix.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.595
That's right, Mannix.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.098
She's more than a model,
she has her own company.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.142
Organic shampoos and oils.
Forty bucks a bottle.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.479
She's also an actress.
She's up for a big Disney movie.

03:07.646 --> 03:08.689
What's she doing here?

03:08.772 --> 03:10.982
Excuse me. What are we doing?
Come on.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.610
-That can't be her.
-There's only one way to be sure.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.154
It says here she's got
a tattoo of a parrot on her finger.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.365
Then that's her. Fourth finger, left hand.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.117
I clocked it when she walked in the door.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.119
He clocked it when she walked
through the door.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.246
The kids got a pulse after all.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.707
You know what? I think I'll go say hello.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.834
No, don't. She's obviously
waiting for someone.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.294
She don't know it yet,
but she waiting for me.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.630
Godspeed.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.756
[music playing]

03:34.840 --> 03:38.176
[Belinda] You know, it's not complicated,
Ira. Either you're on the money train,

03:38.260 --> 03:40.345
or you're on the platform
explaining to your clients

03:40.429 --> 03:42.639
why you missed it... again.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.059
You do that. I'll call you tomorrow.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.269
[customers chattering]

03:47.352 --> 03:48.812
Hey, how you doing?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.773
Do you play poker? We've got a game going.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.109
-I don't gamble.
-It wouldn't really be gambling,

03:54.192 --> 03:55.819
because... I'm dealing.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.822
-I'm waiting for someone.
-Who might that be?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.282
Somebody else.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.491
I'm somebody else.

04:01.992 --> 04:02.993
I'm Tony.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.120
I know who you are.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.915
I clocked that parrot tattoo on your hand
the minute you walked in the room,

04:09.040 --> 04:09.875
Belinda.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.210
Here's the thing, Belinda.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.714
I mean, if I could recognize you,
then other people could too,

04:16.173 --> 04:18.842
and this is what you call
sort of a "borderline" neighborhood.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.802
You know what I mean? A lot of creeps,

04:20.886 --> 04:22.053
wannabe tough guys.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.140
I'll tell you what...
I should just sit here.

04:25.223 --> 04:28.602
-Just until your friend shows up.
-I can take care of myself, thank you.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.729
Do you like magic?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.522
What are you gonna... disappear?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.024
[Tony laughs] Funny, too.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.234
No... it's a little trick I do.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.361
-Give me your phone.
-I will not give you my phone.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.405
Why? You can trust me.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.364
I'm a cop.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.365
Or I was a cop.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.242
You're up there on the wall?

04:44.326 --> 04:46.119
I'm kind of on a different wall.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.039
-I was a different kind of cop.
-What kind is that?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.374
I was kind of a naughty cop.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.418
Maybe you heard of me? Tony Caruso?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.504
-The Caruso Commission?
-No.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.340
Doesn't matter anyway,
Let me show you my trick.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.549
Okay. Here you go.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.010
Abracadabra...

05:02.177 --> 05:04.054
-[customers chattering]
-[music playing]

05:04.137 --> 05:06.264
-Now you've got my phone number.
-That's your trick?

05:06.848 --> 05:09.017
-Ta-da!
-That's not really magic.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.769
No, the magic comes later.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.980
[laughs] No, seriously. I'm kidding.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.859
Listen, if you have
any trouble tonight, or...

05:18.276 --> 05:21.822
if you're looking for some trouble.
Give me a call. I'm four doors down.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.365
No, thank you. Goodnight.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.200
It's the yellow house--

05:25.325 --> 05:27.118
-No. Thank you.
-Okay.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.288
I just wanted you to know
where the... in case you...

05:30.497 --> 05:32.499
[Tony Sr. sighs]

05:33.166 --> 05:34.876
[Cora] He's coming. [clears throat]

05:35.085 --> 05:37.087
[humming]

05:40.090 --> 05:41.174
I wasn't feeling it.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.177
You know what? It's her loss.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.971
[Tony Sr.] My man. My man right there.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.807
[traffic noises]

05:50.100 --> 05:51.142
[doorbell]

05:51.977 --> 05:53.687
I'm coming.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.480
[huffs]

05:56.815 --> 05:57.816
Who is this?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.402
[pants]

06:00.652 --> 06:02.279
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.196
Hi.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.907
[Belinda] Remember me?

06:05.991 --> 06:06.992
I think so.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.827
[chuckles] I wanted to apologize.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.620
I said some terrible things last night,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.998
but that's not who I am. Really.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.334
Okay. Would you like to come in?

06:16.418 --> 06:18.503
Yeah, I was coming off
a 10-hour shoot in Long Island,

06:18.587 --> 06:20.171
and I was just tired and mad at myself.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.382
And... you were just trying
to be nice.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.425
But guys...

06:23.675 --> 06:24.759
hit on me all the time.

06:24.843 --> 06:25.844
But you're different.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.887
I am different.

06:27.888 --> 06:28.847
But not too different.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.599
I'm just different enough.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.976
[chuckles] See what I mean?
You're very funny.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.061
Oh, my God! [grunts]

06:35.228 --> 06:37.814
I've been thinking about you.
You have a long night?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.150
Yeah. You have no idea.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.278
And I have no idea.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.613
I don't remember anything.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.448
Have you heard of a prairie oyster?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.450
-A what?
-A prairie oyster?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.036
It's the best hangover cure in the world.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.997
-Where's your kitchen?
-That way.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.999
-Shall I make it?
-Yeah, sure.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.627
[whispers] What?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.005
[Belinda] Some tomato juice...

07:02.339 --> 07:04.049
some Worchestershire sauce...

07:04.132 --> 07:06.092
some salt, some pepper...

07:06.384 --> 07:07.886
and an egg.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.767
-[Belinda] Here, drink this.
-I think I'd rather stay the way I am.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.726
Don't be a baby.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.312
-Hi.
-There he is.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.521
Good morning, sleepy-head.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.483
[Belinda] Would you like some OJ?
It's freshly squeezed.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.570
And I come bearing gifts. Hold on.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.616
It's called Egyptian musk.
It's not even on the market yet.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.576
You two could be my focus group.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.538
[Tony Sr.]
Hey, TJ. Come here. Check this out.

07:35.872 --> 07:36.873
It's her website.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.379
What do you think?

07:43.004 --> 07:43.838
I...

07:43.922 --> 07:46.299
stopped thinking 30 seconds ago.
when I walked in the kitchen.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.676
It used to be more provocative,

07:47.759 --> 07:50.720
but I toned it way down.
I'm trying to be Disney friendly.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.597
Check this out.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.266
That's my audition for <i>Sleeping Beauty.</i>

07:56.184 --> 07:58.520
<i>Some girls never</i>
<i>meet their Prince Charming.</i>

07:59.062 --> 08:01.231
<i>And now I have to choose</i>
<i>between three of them.</i>

08:01.314 --> 08:03.149
It's between me and two other girls.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.359
Forget about it.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.611
-[laughs] It's a no-brainer. You got it.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.781
-You definitely got it.
-[chuckles] I wish you ran the studio.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.700
So... Anthony...

08:12.075 --> 08:13.994
Your old man was just
bragging on you.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.830
He said that you're
the best detective in the city.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.874
-I taught him everything I know.
-Except right from wrong.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.252
[laughs] That I learned on my own.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.839
So...<i></i>where did you end up last night?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.174
I don't know.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.719
Well, what time did you get in?

08:30.802 --> 08:33.930
These are all good questions,
but I... I don't remember.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.682
[mobile phone ringing]

08:35.765 --> 08:37.517
It's all a big, beautiful blur.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.269
[Belinda]
I know that blur well. Believe me.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.186
Caruso.

08:41.813 --> 08:42.647
Was he a guest?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.234
Who found him?

08:46.401 --> 08:47.777
I need to call my manager.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.030
Can I borrow yours? My phone is dead.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.489
Oh, sorry.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.033
I can't find it.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.076
I was looking for it last night.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.161
Wait.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.371
-It's not in your room?
-No, I looked all over.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.706
That much I do remember.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.959
I must have left it someplace.
What the heck!

09:03.168 --> 09:05.378
Oh my God, this is like that movie:

09:05.795 --> 09:06.671
<i>The Hangover.</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:09.215
I love that movie.
We should we should go and find it.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.258
You mean us? Me and you?

09:10.341 --> 09:11.301
Yeah, why not?

09:11.384 --> 09:12.719
For kicks and giggles.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.971
I'm a big fan
of both kicks and giggles.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.097
-Yeah?
-[both chuckle]

09:16.181 --> 09:17.265
Lock it down.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.060
Tell Detective Vasquez
I can meet her there.<i></i>Okay?

09:20.143 --> 09:21.936
-What's up?
-The Neptune Hotel.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.980
One of the guests was shot and killed.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.192
See, that's why I never pay in advance.
[laughs]

09:27.484 --> 09:29.402
Wait a minute. I just remembered.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.905
I lent my coat to my friend Wendell.

09:32.072 --> 09:36.076
The phone is probably in the pocket.
Come with me, we'll go find this phone.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.912
TJ, we're going out for a little while.
A little "kicks and giggles."

09:38.995 --> 09:40.997
It's like a scavenger hunt.
I'm going to get my coat.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.458
I love your face.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.044
[chuckles and being excited]

09:47.462 --> 09:48.421
What?

09:48.671 --> 09:49.506
She digs me.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.216
Is that so hard to believe?

09:51.883 --> 09:52.717
Yes.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.511
Yes, it is.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.063
[traffic noises]

10:08.650 --> 10:10.026
[door's bells jingles]

10:10.110 --> 10:11.402
Gentlemen, good morning.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.239
-[man] Look who's awake.
-[man] Look who's alive.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.949
Listen, I don't have much tme.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.450
I'm here with a friend.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.371
Hi.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.040
-[man] Ouch!
-Tony's been telling me all about you.

10:24.207 --> 10:27.293
Gentlemen, this is Belinda Mannix,
as seen on your TV's,

10:27.377 --> 10:29.420
and in your secret, wildest fantasies.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.882
Belinda dear,
this is my friend Wendell Kirk.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.134
This is Wendell's shop,

10:34.217 --> 10:37.137
at least until the IRS takes
a closer look. [laughs]

10:37.387 --> 10:38.680
And over here, we have...

10:38.805 --> 10:41.766
Mr. Frankie Storch,
and my man, Curious Hal.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.768
Why do they call you Curious Hal?

10:44.018 --> 10:46.020
[music playing]

10:46.271 --> 10:47.105
I don't know.

10:47.689 --> 10:48.523
You never asked?

10:51.067 --> 10:51.901
No.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.781
Well, we we don't have much time.
Wendell, we're looking for my cell phone.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.825
Did I happen to lend you my jacket
last night?

10:58.950 --> 10:59.826
Your jacket? No.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.870
Well, I guess we've got to keep looking.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.164
[Wendell] Wait a minute.
Just wait one minute here.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.422
[Tony Sr. laughs sarcastically]

11:12.547 --> 11:14.090
-Very funny, Tony.
-What?

11:14.215 --> 11:16.301
Now that I'm getting a good look,
it's obvious

11:16.384 --> 11:18.386
that the real Belinda Mannix
blew you off,

11:18.469 --> 11:20.346
and you went out and got yourself
a look alike.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.599
-What's he paying you, sweetheart.
-Belinda, show him.

11:22.891 --> 11:23.975
[clears throat]

11:24.350 --> 11:26.186
[blows a kiss]

11:26.269 --> 11:28.062
-Nice to meet you.
-Any other questions?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.063
No further questions.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.232
[laughs] Okay, listen, we have to run.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.401
-Say goodbye, darling.
-Goodbye, Darling.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.528
[Tony Sr. laughs]

11:36.571 --> 11:38.698
[Tony Sr.] After you, my love. [chuckles]

11:39.365 --> 11:40.491
[Belinda sighs]

11:40.992 --> 11:41.951
Are you finished?

11:42.035 --> 11:42.869
What?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.830
We both know, you didn't
loan your jacket to anybody.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.625
You wanted to show me off to your friends.
Fine. They saw me.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.085
But you promised me a scavenger hunt.

11:51.878 --> 11:55.215
-So, are we going to do this or not?
-Yes. We're going to find this phone.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.343
Let's see. The thing is,
I was so out of it last night.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.011
The whole night's like a blur--

12:00.595 --> 12:02.639
Wait a minute.
I think I know where to look.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.432
"To the Batmobile."

12:05.099 --> 12:06.351
I do love your face.

12:19.948 --> 12:20.782
Lieutenant?

12:22.575 --> 12:23.409
Lieutenant?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.079
-What's that?
-His hotel bill.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.497
It was under the door.

12:27.789 --> 12:28.623
Thank you.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.043
Sir, we found the cartridge.
It's a Serato hollow point.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.963
I haven't seen those in a while.
It's probably traceable.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.923
Yes sir. I'll check with the Feds.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.967
Junior, we have an ID.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.638
Al Monte, 56, lived in Jersey City
doing God's work.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.599
-He was a priest?
-Booking bachelor parties.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.893
"Wet and Wild, Incorporated.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.937
We are young, limber and fun."

12:51.479 --> 12:52.522
Bachelor parties?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.275
Lieutenant, this was on the nightstand.

12:56.651 --> 12:57.694
Candy?

12:57.819 --> 12:58.861
Maybe he had the munchies.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.364
Caruso...

13:04.284 --> 13:05.201
Caruso?

13:05.702 --> 13:06.536
You okay?

13:07.245 --> 13:08.121
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.164
[police radio income]

13:10.248 --> 13:11.958
I've been up and down the hall.
Nobody heard the shot.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.251
Could have been a silencer?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.128
A silencer means a contract.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.754
This was no random hit.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.424
Where's the laptop?

13:19.674 --> 13:20.508
What laptop?

13:21.092 --> 13:22.135
He paid for Wi-Fi.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.220
[breathes deeply] Doesn't make sense.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.723
Maybe that's what they were after,
the laptop.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.976
No, I mean about my father and the model.
Belinda Mannix?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.894
My God, are you still hung up on that?

13:31.978 --> 13:34.647
You didn't see them together this morning.
She was all over him.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.565
It was very...

13:35.940 --> 13:36.858
Excuse us.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.780
She's so young.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.325
-She's half his age.
-She's an adult.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.868
And so is your father.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.912
At least, chronologically.
Let's get back in the game.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.248
There's a guy on the floor
who's room temperature.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.501
-He'd like a few minutes of your time.
-Of course, you're right.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.503
[breathes heavily] Sorry.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.387
It's not just his age.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.930
Oh my God.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.140
My father's broke.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.226
He's broke and he's a convicted felon.
She's jeopardizing her whole career.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.480
That's exactly why she did it.
Your father's dangerous. It's...

14:15.813 --> 14:17.065
like bungee jumping.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.067
Some women need it for the buzz.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.028
Believe me, I've jumped off
my fair share of cliffs.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.281
-That doesn't makes sense.
-No relationship makes sense.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.742
That's why therapists charge $200 an hour.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.535
Caruso...

14:29.869 --> 14:30.703
Look at me.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.457
Hi, it doesn't matter
because it's over, alright?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.459
It's over. It was just an itch.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.461
She scratched the itch.
She's already moved on.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.713
She probably doesn't even
remember his name.

14:40.922 --> 14:44.842
She cancelled all of her appointments,
so they could spend the day together.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.135
Really?

14:50.056 --> 14:50.973
I got nothin'.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.311
[Tony Sr.]Losing your cell phone.
That's the worst.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.896
Your whole life is there.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.731
All your photos, all your contacts...

14:59.315 --> 15:00.650
-Here's one.
-Are those yours?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.402
No, same brands.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.864
Let's see. Wait a minute.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.908
I've been looking for this.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.300
[chuckles]

15:26.426 --> 15:27.593
-I wasn't done.
-I know.

15:27.802 --> 15:28.719
Is this everything?

15:28.845 --> 15:29.679
Yes, ma'am.

15:29.804 --> 15:33.391
I have to be honest, Tony.
You're starting to remind me of my father.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.392
He play the uke?

15:34.559 --> 15:36.894
No, he broke every promise he ever made.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.397
I don't think I can be
with a man like that. You know?

15:40.148 --> 15:41.274
Wait a minute. No.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.692
I'm not like your father.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.694
I'm not like him. Forget it.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.446
Let me think...

15:46.612 --> 15:48.322
The game ends around 10 o'clock...

15:48.823 --> 15:49.824
I had a vodka.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.492
I had another vodka.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.911
And then we started those stupid shots.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.663
-Did you try Patel's?
-What's Patel's?

15:55.746 --> 15:56.873
It's a bodega in Park Slope.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.499
Best samosa in Brooklyn.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.502
Whenever Tony gets trashed,
we usually find him at Patel's.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.628
What did I tell you?

16:03.838 --> 16:04.672
Let's go to Patel's.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.426
"Kicks and giggles," remember? [chuckles]

16:09.427 --> 16:11.262
-See you, pal.
-[Belinda chuckles]

16:17.602 --> 16:21.189
Albert Alan Monte, married, divorced,
married, divorced...

16:21.397 --> 16:22.899
married, divorced.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.775
-How did I miss this guy?
-[telephone ringing]

16:24.859 --> 16:26.611
He has a business partner, Rebecca Zucker.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.446
We're meeting her in Jersey later.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.534
Or, we could just
sit around all day and...

16:33.910 --> 16:35.453
obsess about your father.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.843
You see that building there?

16:51.302 --> 16:52.678
-Yeah.
-I used to own it.

16:53.012 --> 16:53.846
Really?

16:54.222 --> 16:56.516
It was kind of a stash house. You know...

16:56.766 --> 17:00.561
We would highjack trucks at the airport
and then stash the merchandise there

17:00.645 --> 17:01.938
until we could sell it.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.148
So you were kind of an outlaw.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.566
[chuckles] I like that.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.485
-Kindred spirit.
-Belinda Mannix?

17:08.653 --> 17:10.655
[guys showing excitment]

17:11.030 --> 17:12.657
-Oh, my God,
-We know you.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.575
We were just watching
the Victoria's Secret--

17:14.659 --> 17:16.953
You had those wings.
They were, like, smoking.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.913
Oh, my God! Can we get a photo with you?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.915
Come on, guys, it's her day off.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.667
Show some class.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.211
Come on, one picture.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.798
One, two, three...

17:29.131 --> 17:31.133
That's great. Can I get a copy of that?

17:31.217 --> 17:32.093
Tony, Patel's.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.011
Okay, yeah. All right, boys.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.013
-Thank you.
-Goodbye. [laughs]

17:37.598 --> 17:38.975
[Pc operator] Guys... Hey!

17:39.475 --> 17:40.977
You're gonna wanna see this.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.312
-[phone ringing]
-[police radio]

17:43.479 --> 17:45.481
[policemen chattering]

17:49.235 --> 17:52.363
This is the hotel service elevator
yesterday afternoon.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.581
-What are we looking at?
-Wait for it...

18:10.881 --> 18:12.091
Can you speed it up?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.427
No... it's more dramatic this way.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.724
Whoa.

18:21.976 --> 18:22.852
We'll get him.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.979
He can hop, but he can't hide.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.408
[Tony Sr. laughing] Yeah, okay.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.367
Any luck?

18:38.451 --> 18:39.619
No, it wasn't there.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.246
[man shouting in Hindi]

18:42.371 --> 18:43.289
What's he saying?

18:43.789 --> 18:44.915
I have no idea.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.335
[shouting in Hindi and English]

18:47.418 --> 18:48.836
Did he just say, ice cream?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.922
Probably has something to do
with the ice cream freezer.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.592
Evidently, I was here last night
and threw up in it.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.677
-But you don't remember it.
-Listen...

18:56.761 --> 18:58.471
I think we should just
give up on this phone.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.140
-It's not that big a deal.
-I'm not giving up, Tony.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.808
I launched my own company.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.144
From scratch, on my own.
My 40 million dollar company.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.145
I'm not a quitter.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.521
I finish what I start,

19:07.605 --> 19:09.732
and I'm not going home without that phone.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.322
Let me think.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.907
Yeah. Let me think.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.493
[lady] Wet and Wild, you mind holding?

19:20.576 --> 19:22.244
Guess what, you're going to hold anyway.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.414
-[Tony Jr.] You're busy.
-[sighs] It never stops.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.709
I got four girls in AC tonight,
and a corporate gig tomorrow.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.004
I was thinking of canceling
after what happened to Albert,

19:32.088 --> 19:33.255
you know, out of respect,

19:33.339 --> 19:35.299
but then I figured... screw Albert.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.801
He would never stop for a second

19:36.884 --> 19:38.427
if somebody painted the walls with me.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.637
That's the spirit.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.224
Do you know what Mr. Monte
was doing in Manhattan?

19:43.391 --> 19:44.308
I have no idea, honey.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.977
Or why he'd rent a hotel room.
Was he meeting someone?

19:47.061 --> 19:50.356
He was always up to¬†something.
He never told me anything. Why would he?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.733
[laughs]
I only run his whole damn company for him.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.903
This isn't going to work.
I'll get back to you.

19:57.029 --> 19:57.863
How old are you?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.242
How old am I?
I don't see how that's relevant.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.910
You're what, 28?

20:03.119 --> 20:05.830
You've got four years left
if you want to make some real money.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.207
With a body like that, you'd do alright.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.545
[laughs]
You are talking to Detective Vasquez,

20:12.628 --> 20:15.005
She's third grade
with the All-City Homicide Task Force.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.424
I'm talking after work,

20:16.507 --> 20:18.759
part-time, holidays, weekends.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.636
Don't say no. Think about it.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.973
She's... not going to take that card.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.182
Really?

20:28.185 --> 20:30.563
Did Mr. Monte have
any problems with anyone?

20:30.646 --> 20:32.565
Who did not have problems with?

20:32.940 --> 20:34.400
The clients, the talent...

20:34.525 --> 20:37.737
The truth is, Albert didn't always
respect boundaries the way he should.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.697
And everybody's got boundaries now.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.449
Did he cross any boundary in particular?

20:41.866 --> 20:44.160
It's not a short list.
I'd have to get back to you, honey.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.619
We appreciate that, ma'am.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.748
And in the meantime,
we'd like to search the house.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.000
-Do you have an address for him?
-You're looking at it.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.420
Wife number three took the condo.
Albert's been living upstairs since June.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.629
First door on your right.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.341
Hey, I'm booking a party bus
out of Queens, tomorrow.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.968
Eight hundred dollars, plus tips.

21:01.051 --> 21:01.886
Think about it.

21:02.136 --> 21:05.264
She's not going to think about it.
You're not going to think about it.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.016
-What time tomorrow?
-8:00 p.m.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.520
She does this to...

21:11.896 --> 21:13.856
toy with me, and to annoy,

21:14.106 --> 21:15.441
but it doesn't get to me.

21:15.733 --> 21:16.609
It does not.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.029
Thank you.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.368
Why do you torture me?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.120
Because I can.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.544
-[Tony Sr.] Don't touch anything.
-[Cora] I know, it could be evidence.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.754
No, just don't...

21:37.505 --> 21:38.422
touch anything.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.299
What are we looking for?

21:40.841 --> 21:43.010
Well, they took his laptop,
so maybe...

21:43.427 --> 21:45.513
he backed up his hard drive on something.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.141
Wow! He's very into films.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.435
What's that?

21:51.936 --> 21:53.020
<i>Robo Whores.</i>

21:54.063 --> 21:55.147
<i>Robo Whores 2.</i>

21:56.398 --> 21:57.316
There's a sequel?

21:57.483 --> 22:00.528
They had to make a sequel,
there were so many unanswered questions.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.157
<i>Dawson's Creek</i> Season Eight, Season Nine.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.742
That's weird.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.370
-What's weird?
-It was only on for five years.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.831
How do you know that?

22:13.123 --> 22:14.041
It's "The Creek".

22:18.879 --> 22:19.839
Ramada Inn.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.218
Alright, send the box to the station,
we can have Ryan sort through it.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.136
-I'll meet you there.
-Where are you going?

22:26.554 --> 22:28.430
I'm going to have lunch with my dad,

22:28.681 --> 22:29.557
and...

22:31.016 --> 22:32.977
-her.
-Belinda Mannix,

22:33.060 --> 22:34.144
your new stepmom.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.730
Don't say that. Why would you say that?

22:36.814 --> 22:38.899
-Stranger things have happened.
-Name one.

22:40.860 --> 22:41.944
[grins]

22:42.361 --> 22:43.362
[people chattering]

22:43.445 --> 22:45.447
[Tony Sr. singing]

22:56.166 --> 22:57.084
Gordon, how are you?

22:57.167 --> 22:58.085
Alright, love.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.046
Look who's here. Son of mine.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.131
What do you say, kid?

23:02.214 --> 23:03.048
What do you say?

23:04.300 --> 23:06.218
-How are you? [laughs]
-How am I?

23:06.302 --> 23:07.469
I'm living the dream.

23:07.970 --> 23:08.804
I see that.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.514
Where is the dream?

23:11.599 --> 23:13.642
She had a meeting. Some business thing.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.270
Let me tell you something.
She owns her own company.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.938
She's a smart kid.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.691
I tell you, TJ, I never thought
I could feel this way again.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.735
I feel... I feel reborn.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.196
Hey Gordy, I'll have a turkey club
and a Budweiser.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.365
Get my son anything he wants.
Up to four dollars.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.034
I'm good. Thank you.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.328
-Did you find your phone?
-No, not yet.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.040
Belinda is so funny.
That's all she thinks about.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.876
She's worried about you.
I think that's sweet.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.670
[chuckles] My man, Gordy, my man.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.841
That's all you've been doing, just...
looking for your phone?

23:46.050 --> 23:48.969
Women. It'll take a smarter guy than me
to figure them out.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.472
You working that Times Square thing?

23:52.222 --> 23:54.308
-How's it look?
-It's a bear.

23:54.475 --> 23:58.479
The victim was a world-class sleazebag.
We've interviewed at least 12 suspects.

23:58.562 --> 23:59.396
Plus...

23:59.772 --> 24:01.941
-I've been a little distracted.
-By what?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.443
What, me and Belinda?

24:05.194 --> 24:08.447
-She knows you're not rich, right?
-What kind of question is that?

24:08.572 --> 24:11.450
I'm just using the same
investigative techniques you taught me.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.994
A cop looks for unusual behavior,
a break in the pattern...

24:14.078 --> 24:16.413
This is not a murder investigation, TJ.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.040
It's a serious relationship

24:18.123 --> 24:20.459
between a man
and a Victoria's Secret supermodel.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.712
You promised you wouldn't date
anybody younger than me.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.674
Come on, she's on the cover
of <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

24:26.924 --> 24:29.218
It's what you call
The Swimsuit Issue exemption.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.220
Let me ask you this, and please...

24:31.595 --> 24:32.554
Don't take offense.

24:33.681 --> 24:36.684
When you're alone together...
are you different?

24:36.892 --> 24:37.810
Different how?

24:38.602 --> 24:39.645
Are you nicer?

24:39.770 --> 24:41.522
Are you more considerate to people?

24:41.855 --> 24:42.773
I consider people.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.650
Not consider, Dad. Considerate.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.736
-There's a difference.
-What do you want me to tell you?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.071
I am just me.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.823
I am as God made me.

24:50.948 --> 24:51.949
And she digs it.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.952
Alright. Let me ask you something now.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.163
If this woman's not into me,
then what's she doing with me?

24:58.247 --> 25:00.082
You said it yourself, I'm not rich.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.919
Just being with me could derail
her whole career.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.296
So, tell me, Detective,

25:06.505 --> 25:07.423
what's her angle?

25:07.756 --> 25:08.924
What's in it for her?

25:43.876 --> 25:46.128
We've got a problem. Something's come up.

25:47.004 --> 25:50.340
What happened, did your old talent agent
rise from the grave?

25:50.799 --> 25:51.633
Not quite.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.344
You're not going to like this.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.221
When I paid you at the bar last night,

25:56.305 --> 25:58.140
my phone was on the seat.
I must have sat on it.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.141
I called somebody.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.601
You called somebody?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.895
it was an accident.
It was a "butt dial."

26:02.978 --> 26:05.522
-A "butt dial"?
-Let's not over-react.

26:05.647 --> 26:06.982
We can figure this out.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.027
Somebody heard? They heard me?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.653
No, not yet.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.741
The guy I called can't find his phone.
We've been looking for it together.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.618
When he finds it I'll delete the message.

26:18.368 --> 26:22.164
Lady, I don't care how many billboards
your pretty face is on.

26:22.456 --> 26:23.791
We talked about this.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.334
We talked about discretion,

26:25.417 --> 26:27.336
and we talked about consequences.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.296
You don't have to threaten me.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.715
I told you I'm on it.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.259
If you're on it, then what the hell
am I doing here?

26:37.971 --> 26:40.140
There's a chance
that I can't contain the problem.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.560
And if that's the case,
I don't want to have to worry about you.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.771
What are you going to do Sleeping Beauty?

26:46.355 --> 26:47.231
Kill me?

26:48.690 --> 26:50.150
It's a lot harder than it looks.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.737
-[taser ticks]
-[gasps and pants]

26:54.113 --> 26:55.489
Where's the gun?

26:58.826 --> 27:02.871
[grunts and pants]

27:03.288 --> 27:05.332
How does this work?
Where's the safety?

27:06.416 --> 27:07.292
There it is.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.170
[gunshot]

27:17.594 --> 27:18.554
It's not that hard.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.142
We've already ID'd the vic.
He's a pretty big fish.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.351
His name is Corey Speck.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.562
He used to do muscle work
for the Numark Brothers,

27:26.812 --> 27:27.729
mostly in Philly.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.274
Feds have been looking for this guy
since 2012.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.484
[police radio]

27:32.901 --> 27:33.861
Is that a taser?

27:34.194 --> 27:36.822
Affirmative, Dr. Kornbluth
thinks he was tased then shot.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.707
What did we win?

27:47.541 --> 27:48.750
A Serato hollow-point.

27:49.918 --> 27:50.878
Second one today.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.340
I've got some indentations over here.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.550
[Tony Jr. ]Cane?

27:58.093 --> 27:59.094
High heels.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.220
A woman?

28:00.637 --> 28:01.805
How you doing, guys?

28:02.639 --> 28:04.600
-So, this is the scene.
-That's where it is?

28:05.350 --> 28:08.520
Holy Moses,
isn't that Victoria's Secret...

28:08.770 --> 28:09.688
Belinda Mannix.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.608
Mannix, that's her name.
What is she doing here?

28:13.692 --> 28:15.777
-[Belinda chuckling]
-[policemen flirting]

28:17.988 --> 28:21.325
-[Belinda chuckles]
-[policemen asking for autograph]

28:22.409 --> 28:23.243
Dad!

28:23.994 --> 28:25.370
Hey, T, what's happening?

28:25.495 --> 28:27.122
Detective. How's it going?

28:28.582 --> 28:29.416
How's it going?

28:30.292 --> 28:32.294
You can't bring a civilian
to an active crime scene.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.337
Come on, son.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.632
She's not exactly a civilian.
I mean, look at her. [laughs]

28:36.715 --> 28:39.009
Burl called, he told me you got called in.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.886
I told her, she got all excited.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.639
She begged me to bring her here.
It's her first crime scene.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.682
She's going to play a cop
in her next movie,

28:45.807 --> 28:46.892
and she's doing research.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.144
It'll be good PR.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.730
The Department could use it
after all the corruption scandals.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.523
Those scandals are because of you.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.692
Exactly. I'm making amends.

28:55.776 --> 28:56.735
You're welcome.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.363
We're going back to her place after.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.157
She wants to show me¬†how much
she appreciates my help.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.494
And some people say there is no God.
[laughs]

29:06.161 --> 29:08.497
First, she's all about her phone,
and now this?

29:10.123 --> 29:12.084
-It's hinkey.
-Come on.

29:12.876 --> 29:13.710
Am I wrong?

29:14.378 --> 29:15.963
It's hinkey-ish.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.381
It's hinkey-ish.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.841
What kind of brush is that?
Camel hair.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.513
It'll pick up any latent prints.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.723
Poor guy.

29:26.807 --> 29:27.975
How can you stand it?

29:29.017 --> 29:30.394
You never do.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.855
When you get used to it,
It is time to quit.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.818
Miss Mannix?

29:37.943 --> 29:39.903
Excuse me.
I'm gonna need you to move back, please.

29:39.987 --> 29:43.407
TJ, look at you.
"Move back, please." Are you in charge?

29:44.074 --> 29:45.409
I was until...

29:45.993 --> 29:46.910
you showed up.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.037
I'm going to have to take you
to the station tomorrow.

29:49.121 --> 29:49.955
Why?

29:50.372 --> 29:53.208
You just touched the car.
We're going to need to take your prints,

29:53.417 --> 29:54.668
so that we can eliminate them.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.461
I didn't realize.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.922
Lieutenant, we found a hair.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.883
That could be mine too. I'm sorry.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.051
No, it's not a problem.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.053
It happens all the time.

30:05.971 --> 30:09.016
-[sighs] What else did you touch?
-I may have touched the mirror.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.227
Why did you touch the mirror?

30:12.894 --> 30:14.187
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

30:16.023 --> 30:16.940
Weren't you?

30:23.322 --> 30:24.781
[policeman] Lieutenant? Detective.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.535
You're going to want to see this.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.626
There must have been a camera
inside the boombox.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.339
It's a nasty business,
secretly videotaping these parties.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.258
Husbands, politicians, doctors...

30:44.009 --> 30:47.179
A lot of people pay serious money
to make these tapes disappear.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.223
-How many of them are there?
-More than 50.

30:50.515 --> 30:51.850
We're going to be here awhile.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.560
[music playing on video]

30:53.685 --> 30:54.811
Hey, hey, hey...

30:55.771 --> 30:58.315
Well, if you love your job, it isn't work.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.153
I know, I'm late.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.239
No, keep the photographers there.
I'll pay the overtime.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.575
I'll be bringing a friend.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.868
Hey, Belinda...

31:10.243 --> 31:11.912
You've got blood on your hands.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.956
Probably from the crime scene.
I've got a tissue.

31:15.624 --> 31:16.541
Wait a minute.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.085
We're in business.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.211
What?

31:19.294 --> 31:20.128
I found my phone.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.671
I remember where I left it.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.341
[cars honking]

31:27.886 --> 31:30.806
-[Belinda] Are you sure about this?
-[Tony Sr.] Yeah, I'm visualizing it.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.266
You know how you visualize things
as they come back to you?

31:33.642 --> 31:34.976
I took a cab from Patel's.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.978
I was looking for money.
I put my phone down.

31:37.062 --> 31:37.938
That's it.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.941
You left it on the seat.
It's probably in their lost and found.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.739
Nobody home.

31:49.491 --> 31:50.784
We'll come back tomorrow.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.911
I don't do tomorrow, Tony.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.830
You "don't do tomorrow?"

31:55.038 --> 31:55.997
No, I do now.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.833
We're here now! We should just...

31:58.500 --> 31:59.334
get it.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.128
What do you want me to do, break in?

32:01.211 --> 32:03.755
Sweetheart, I can't do that.
I can't break in. I'm still on parole.

32:03.839 --> 32:04.798
It's not worth it.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.636
[Tony Sr. grunts]

32:11.304 --> 32:12.389
I'm okay.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.266
You okay?

32:14.891 --> 32:15.767
Yeah. [pants]

32:22.566 --> 32:23.442
Do you see it?

32:24.067 --> 32:24.985
Give me a minute.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.154
Keep your pants on.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.949
At least until I tell you otherwise.

First things first.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.361
[shooter] I didn't mention it earlier.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.405
I'm a big fan of your work.

33:10.739 --> 33:11.656
I'm a fan of yours too.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.160
If you don't mind my asking,
what did he have over you?

33:15.243 --> 33:18.038
[Belinda] Youthful indiscretion.
He would have bled me dry.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.540
[shooter] Want some advice?
Find a microwave and nuke it.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.833

I'm surprised you haven't been recognized.

Freeze the frame. Right there.

Can you zoom in on the hand?

34:26.064 --> 34:27.649
So she knew Al Monte.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.526
And the man who killed him.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.237
Oh my God.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.613
Dad.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.664
[Priest] We don't usually take confessions
this late.

34:42.831 --> 34:43.707
I know, Father.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.459
[Tony Sr.] I'm sorry, but it was
kind of an emergency.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.712
[Priest]
We haven't seen you at mass, Anthony.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.630
How long since your last confession?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.173
[Tony Sr.] It's been a while.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.009
Since I lost Connie.

34:54.759 --> 34:55.844
So, four years, Father.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.222
[Priest] That's quite a long time.
What sins have you committed since then?

35:00.265 --> 35:01.975
It's not a short list.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.729
Have you cursed?
Have you taken the Lord's name in vain?

35:05.854 --> 35:08.148
Father, we really can't start there,

35:08.231 --> 35:09.816
because we'll be here all week.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.776
Have you taken pleasure
in impure thoughts?

35:11.943 --> 35:13.320
That's what I mean, Father.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.322
We're really going to have to jump ahead.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.407
Alright, you tell me.
What brings you here?

35:17.657 --> 35:18.575
Okay. Well...

35:19.200 --> 35:20.785
Here's the thing, Father, I...

35:22.787 --> 35:23.997
I'm meeting a friend...

35:24.873 --> 35:27.459
a woman, later tonight and...

35:28.376 --> 35:32.672
I have a very difficult decision to make,
and I just didn't know who else to call.

35:33.715 --> 35:34.883
What kind of decision?

35:36.593 --> 35:39.429
I'm not sure you can
appreciate this Father, but...

35:40.597 --> 35:42.182
this woman is famous.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.184
She's...

35:44.476 --> 35:46.436
the stuff that dreams are made of.

35:46.895 --> 35:50.273
I mean any guy I know would
give a year of his life,

35:50.357 --> 35:52.442
just to spend ten minutes
with this woman.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.653
I mean... any other guy.

35:54.736 --> 35:55.904
[Priest] Is she married?

35:56.446 --> 35:59.074
No, Father, that's not it.
She's not married. It's...

36:00.075 --> 36:01.117
Here's the thing...

36:02.160 --> 36:03.119
She killed a guy.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.581
[Priest] She killed a guy?

36:07.332 --> 36:08.875
She had him killed.

36:09.793 --> 36:13.046
And also, I just learned
that she doesn't like me at all.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.798
She's just with me because...

36:15.090 --> 36:17.258
she thinks I have
some evidence against her.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.761
But, I've decided that...

36:20.470 --> 36:21.304
I don't care.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.264
I just want to be with her.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.644
-The flesh is weak.
-Father...

36:27.977 --> 36:29.646
it is so weak.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.773
Anthony, if this woman
committed a mortal sin,

36:31.898 --> 36:33.149
you have to report it.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.527
You have a duty
to God and to society.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.654
Your son is a righteous man,
you could talk to him.

36:37.737 --> 36:38.947
I know that father.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.408
I know that, and I will talk to him.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.034
But...

36:43.785 --> 36:44.661
can it wait?

36:45.495 --> 36:48.123
I mean, that's the question.
Can I get an extension?

36:49.541 --> 36:50.709
[Priest] An extension?

36:50.792 --> 36:52.043
Just one night, Father.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.545
That's all I'm asking for.

36:54.504 --> 36:55.338
Father...

36:55.880 --> 36:57.799
it's Belinda Mannix.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.721

37:04.139 --> 37:06.516
Do you get <i>Sports Illustrated?</i>

37:07.350 --> 37:08.184
No.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.187
But you are familiar
with their Swimsuit Edition.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.313
Here, look.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.067
-Here's a picture of her. Take a look.
-It doesn't matter what she looks like.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.153
I know that, Father,
but you gotta look at  this.

37:18.278 --> 37:19.821
Anthony, what do you want me to say?

37:21.030 --> 37:23.408
Father, I know this isn't
going to happen, but..

37:24.367 --> 37:25.869
I just wish you could say...

37:26.870 --> 37:27.954
"Bang her in peace."

37:30.373 --> 37:31.374
Voicemail again.

37:31.624 --> 37:32.834

-I got him.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.711
-He's downtown.
-Tribeca?

37:34.836 --> 37:35.712
Looks like it.

37:36.045 --> 37:36.880

37:47.891 --> 37:48.975
You're late.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.394
I told you,
I don't like you out of my sight.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.396
I get worried when you're not around.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.443
I wonder why.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.779
I have some Sancerre I've been saving.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.238
Saving for what?

38:02.572 --> 38:04.532
For... you.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.409
-For us.
-[bottle pops]

38:08.077 --> 38:09.245

38:10.079 --> 38:11.206

[pours wine]

38:14.584 --> 38:15.418
Do I?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.379
So, I had an idea.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.715
We can go back
to the taxi company tomorrow.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.926
A lot of people pay by credit card now.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.887
They might have a record
of who the next passenger was.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.098
You don't give up, do you?

38:29.641 --> 38:32.644
No, I'm a dog with a bone.
[growls and chuckles]

38:33.186 --> 38:34.562
I wanted to thank you.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.356

I am obsessed with you.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.710
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

38:57.794 --> 38:58.753
Is something wrong?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.922
I just need a minute to think.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.383
What's going on?

39:03.466 --> 39:05.134
Just let me think for a second.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.182
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

39:11.975 --> 39:12.934
I can't do this.

39:13.017 --> 39:13.852
I have to go.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.104
You want to leave. Why?

39:32.245 --> 39:34.330
Yeah, my friend Wendell.

He can't go bowling Thursday night.
We're going to reschedule.

It was a contract hit.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.357
She's out of my league.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.568
That is not the way I see it.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.320
You were definitely out of her league.
