00:34.500 --> 00:35.800
Sorry, private party.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.000
Come on, like you're going to say no to these?

01:03.100 --> 01:05.200
time to lock and load.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.800
Gentlemen, pick a target.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.400
Bottom of the stairs.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.000
Blonde.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.200
Nice rack.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.400
Legs to the floor.

01:21.900 --> 01:22.500
Take her down.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Won't know what hit her.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.400
By the wall.

01:30.100 --> 01:30.800
Black hair.

01:30.900 --> 01:31.700
Long neck.

01:32.000 --> 01:32.800
Model hot.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.500
This is your final set, boys, so make it count.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.400
You work the game,

01:36.700 --> 01:37.700
you drop your negs...

01:38.700 --> 01:39.700
and you shoot to kill.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.200
This, uh...

01:50.700 --> 01:51.900
this was on your blouse.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.500
Oh, my god, I'm so embarrassed.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.500
It'll be our little secret.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.300
Hey-- pick a number between one and ten.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.200
Okay, um... seven.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.699
how did you do that?

02:09.900 --> 02:10.600
It wasn't me.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.500
It was us.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.200
love your hair.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.200
Thanks.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.700
Those are extensions, right?

02:19.700 --> 02:20.900
Take it somewhere else.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.200
Come on!

02:25.100 --> 02:26.000
No, I can close her,

02:26.100 --> 02:28.300
- I know I can.
- Never chase.

02:29.000 --> 02:29.700
Move on.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.900
New horse.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.600
I need a woman's opinion.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.000
Okay.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.400
Which is better:

02:57.800 --> 03:00.300
True love or great sex?

03:02.400 --> 03:03.500
Can't I have both?

03:04.200 --> 03:05.400
Oh, yeah.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.200
do you have protection?

03:24.300 --> 03:24.900
Oh...

03:26.000 --> 03:26.800
always.

03:31.000 --> 03:31.900
I'll race you.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.600
Let me just hang this up.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.700
Oh, my god!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.100
What do we know, frank?

03:46.900 --> 03:48.400
Party ended ugly for, uh...

03:48.600 --> 03:49.600
"paul sanders."

03:50.100 --> 03:51.200
Did you get a murder weapon?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Yeah-- ice pick.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.500
Used repeatedly.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.700
Found it in that ice bucket.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.300
What about the place?

04:00.500 --> 04:01.300
Private club.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.500
Private parties.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.400
You know the drill--

04:03.500 --> 04:04.300
anything goes.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.200
The homeowner?

04:05.900 --> 04:07.300
Uh, wayne reynolds.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.600
Runs some kind of seminar.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.600
Teaches single guys how to pick up girls.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.300
Runs a seminar?

04:12.700 --> 04:13.500
Found that in a drawer.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.200
"Score at will."

04:15.300 --> 04:17.600
"Nail chicks like a rock star."

04:18.200 --> 04:20.399
He's got the corner on this dirt-bag market.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.200
He's also got qte a little business on his hands.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.300
Yes, he does, frank.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.600
He also... has murder one.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.500
Yeah!

04:40.700 --> 04:44.700
CSI MIAMI
Season 04 Episode 12

04:49.800 --> 04:52.200
We don't get fooled again

04:53.600 --> 04:55.900
don't get fooled again

04:57.200 --> 04:58.400
no, no!

05:20.600 --> 05:24.600
somebody was very angry at our party boy, Alexx.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.200
Angry enough to leave their mark.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.100
They wrote an "l" on his chest.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.300
Neck punctures are ragged.

05:34.100 --> 05:34.900
Clustered.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.900
Evidence of rage.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.300
Multiple hits to the carotid.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.000
exsanguination.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.100
Fast.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.000
Baby boy bled out with his eyes open.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.800
Okay. Let's get him to autopsy, please.

05:52.900 --> 05:53.900
Mr. Wolfe?

05:55.300 --> 05:58.300
Something definitely came in contact with the vic's shirt.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
What do you think it was?

06:00.600 --> 06:03.400
I'm not sure, but it's littered with an odd kind of fiber.

06:04.000 --> 06:04.900
I'll get it to the lab.

06:05.000 --> 06:05.900
Thank you.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.500
excuse me, Alexx.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.100
Yeah, horat...

06:09.700 --> 06:11.500
yes. Speaking.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.700
Yes, officer.

06:14.900 --> 06:15.800
Okay.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.400
I'll be right there.

06:18.700 --> 06:19.400
Thank you, Alexx.

06:28.900 --> 06:29.700
Officer brown.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Thanks for coming, lieutenant.

06:31.100 --> 06:31.600
Not a problem.

06:31.700 --> 06:32.300
What do we got?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.400
Well, like I said on the phone,

06:33.500 --> 06:35.700
picked up a girl scoring dope on the boardwalk.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.600
I ask her for her id,

06:37.700 --> 06:38.500
and she said call you.

06:38.700 --> 06:39.800
Let me see her, please.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.300
Could you step out of the vehicle, please?

06:54.600 --> 06:55.800
You said the dealer got away?

06:56.100 --> 06:57.400
We swooped, he ran,

06:57.700 --> 06:59.500
- and we couldn't find what he tossed.
- You search the girl?

06:59.700 --> 07:02.600
Yeah. Female officer found five baggies of green plant material,

07:02.700 --> 07:03.500
could be marijuana.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.600
Five baggies.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.500
We need to run a presumptive test and weigh it.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.400
Yes, you do.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.200
Okay.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.600
Bag it, tag it,

07:09.700 --> 07:11.200
and get it to my lab, please.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.600
Yes, sir.What about the girl?

07:12.700 --> 07:14.100
I'll transport her, thank you.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.300
You got it, lieutenant.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.000
Marisol.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.100
Lieutenant Caine, I am so sorry.

07:19.400 --> 07:19.900
I just...

07:20.100 --> 07:21.100
I didn't want to call Eric.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.000
What happened?

07:24.100 --> 07:25.300
I made a buy for myself,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.500
and the police saw the whole thing.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.900
Am I under arrest?

07:33.300 --> 07:33.900
You are.

07:35.200 --> 07:35.900
You want to come with me?

07:37.900 --> 07:38.400
Come on.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.300
I'd never hurt paul sanders.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.400
The guy was my friend.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.400
We trained in the seminar together.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.100
Listen, you got to help me out here.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.800
Couple things I don't understand .

07:59.200 --> 07:59.700
okay

08:00.100 --> 08:02.700
Now, you went up to this room last night to have sex, right?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.100
Had the girl with you?

08:04.200 --> 08:05.600
It's the ultimate close.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.900
Kind of an end game for pickup artists?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.100
Yeah, the big kahuna.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.100
Then I open the closet,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.400
and paul's body falls out.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.300
Okay, see, here's where I don't get.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.500
You're getting ready to jump in bed,

08:15.900 --> 08:17.400
and you're looking for a closet?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.700
This jacket cost 1,500 bucks

08:21.200 --> 08:23.400
well,who the hell worries about a jacket

08:23.600 --> 08:25.600
when you're getting ready to get into somebody's pants?

08:26.100 --> 08:27.700
Women notice neatness.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.700
You learn that in your little seminar?

08:31.200 --> 08:31.700
Yeah.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.100
"Wardrobe is a weapon."

08:33.700 --> 08:35.400
It's one of our first lessons.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.100
Well, let me tell you a little secret about pd seminars:

08:38.700 --> 08:42.100
The guy that calls in a murder usually knows a lot more than he's saying.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.000
Now, we're going to keep your wardrobe right here with us.

08:45.200 --> 08:45.900
How's that sound?

08:47.900 --> 08:49.100
How well did you know the victim?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.900
Paul was one of my students.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.700
Yeah, we heard about your seminar.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.700
What exactly is it that you teach?

08:55.400 --> 08:58.700
I instruct confidence-challenged men in the art of picking up women.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.700
You do that here at your club?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.100
Look, my class had nothing to do with this murder.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.100
Okay.

09:03.700 --> 09:04.500
We'll see about that.

09:04.700 --> 09:05.200
No.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.400
You don't understand.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.600
I can't be connected to this.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
I got a book coming out.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.500
My seminar's going worldwide.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.400
I'm about to become a household name.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.200
I appreciate your pr problem,

09:15.300 --> 09:17.200
but we have a homicide to investigate.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.200
Hey. What's in the jar?

09:21.300 --> 09:23.300
That's how we build our target database.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.600
"Target?"

09:25.300 --> 09:26.600
It's a seminar term.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Girls write their names, numbers,

09:28.100 --> 09:28.800
they put them in the jar,

09:28.900 --> 09:29.900
they get on our list.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.500
Anthen they invite their friends.

09:31.700 --> 09:32.800
And they come to our parties.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.200
Maybe one of them was put off by being referred to as a target.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
We should take it to t lab.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
Mr. Reynolds,

09:39.700 --> 09:42.200
we're going to need ur clothes for exclusionary purposes.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.500
Just make sure I get it back...

09:50.000 --> 09:51.300
this is my lucky shirt.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.200
Hey.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.800
So, did you get anything from our victim's shirt?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.300
Paul sanders?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.000
Your basic polyester blend--

10:07.100 --> 10:07.900
cheap and cheesy.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.500
Yeah.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.000
What about that weird fiber I gave you that I lifted from his shirt?

10:12.700 --> 10:13.400
They are weird.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.100
Check this out.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.900
The fibers I pulled are like silk,

10:18.200 --> 10:19.500
but look at this cross-section.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.200
Oh, yeah...

10:20.600 --> 10:22.300
looks like a-a dumbbell.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.600
The breaking strength is the highest I've seen in a natural fiber.

10:25.900 --> 10:26.800
So it's from a plant?

10:26.900 --> 10:27.500
That's right.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.400
What is it, hemp?

10:29.500 --> 10:30.000
Nope.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.800
You're looking at soy.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.700
Whoever attacked him had on clothes made of woven soy fibers.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.200
Well, I've got two suspects,

10:37.300 --> 10:38.400
that narrows things.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.300
They both had red shirts.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.500
Wayne reynolds?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.400
And todd manning.

10:43.700 --> 10:44.900
Do me a favor, uh,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.500
run the soy fiber against their shirts,

10:46.600 --> 10:47.300
and let me know.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.100
Thanks.

10:48.300 --> 10:48.800
Sure.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.900
So, valera said all victim blood on thece pick and joseph found no prints.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.400
Well, I may have something.

11:14.600 --> 11:19.800
I entered all of the information cards from the club jar as writing samples into the spec comparator.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.100
Running them against...?

11:21.200 --> 11:22.400
The "l" on the victim's chest.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.600
Known against the unknown.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.600
All these women thought that they were dates, not targets.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.400
Yeah, well,

11:27.500 --> 11:29.200
one of 'em doubles back on her "l'S."

11:30.600 --> 11:32.100
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

11:32.200 --> 11:33.300
Because you're squinting.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.400
I'm-I'm tired.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.600
It's not from the nail injury?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.100
Oh, that's old news.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.500
Okay, you're not having eye trouble?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.200
Yeah, I am, because I'm working a double,

11:42.300 --> 11:43.300
and my eyes are fried.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.300
Okay

11:48.300 --> 11:49.300
so looped "l'S."

11:56.800 --> 11:57.900
looks like heather larkin.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.400
All right, I'll talk to her,

11:59.500 --> 12:01.200
and you find out about my soy shirt, okay?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.400
All right, you got a plan.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.700
Yeah, I was there at the private party.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.300
Did you meet our victim, paul sanders?

12:10.500 --> 12:11.400
Matter of fact, I did.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.400
I met him at the bar.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.500
We spoke. He seemed nice.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.700
Something's on your blouse.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.300
Oh, my god, I'm so embarrassed.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.300
It'll be our little secret.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.000
So, what happened next?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.600
Everything turned,

12:27.700 --> 12:28.600
that's what happened.

12:29.000 --> 12:29.700
Turned how?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.900
The guy started working a game on me.

12:33.000 --> 12:33.600
Game?

12:34.700 --> 12:35.900
The lint game.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.200
Apparently, that's the ice breaker.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.600
The neg, the intentional insult.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.100
The kiss close.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.700
It was pathetic.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.300
Pick a number between one and ten.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.700
How did you do that?

12:49.900 --> 12:50.700
It wasn't me.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.300
It was us.

12:55.000 --> 12:55.900
Did he pick you up?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.200
You mean, did I go upstairs with him?

12:59.600 --> 13:00.200
Yes.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.300
Yes, I did.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.000
I gave him a pass.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.700
I thought things would get better.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.400
What happened when you got upstairs?

13:08.100 --> 13:09.100
It got worse.

13:10.900 --> 13:11.600
Come on, babe.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.300
We both know why we're here.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.500
You thought I would just fall into bed with you?

13:16.800 --> 13:17.300
Yeah.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.700
you disgust me.

13:21.000 --> 13:21.700
loser!

13:22.000 --> 13:22.600
Ow!

13:27.000 --> 13:27.800
What a bitch!

13:28.200 --> 13:29.900
So, you wrote the "l" on his chest,

13:30.100 --> 13:31.300
and it stood for "loser."

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
That's what the guy was.

13:33.100 --> 13:33.800
When I ran out of there,

13:33.900 --> 13:35.800
he wastill calling me names.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.300
Very much alive.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.400
You know, the problem is that we can't confirm that.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.600
Look, I'm sorry the guy's dead,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.300
but I'm not surprised.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.200
That's kind of callous, isn't it?

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
I'm callous?

13:50.800 --> 13:53.000
These guys--they treat women like they're disposable.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.500
Little door prizes in their game.

13:56.000 --> 13:56.900
They don't even want us.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
They just want to be able to show each other that they got us.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.500
So what were you doing there, then?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.300
Getting disillusioned,

14:02.400 --> 14:03.700
and I'm not the only one.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.500
It could be any girl out there.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.300
Lieutenant Caine.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
I got your page.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.700
This just came in from mdpd, special processing.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.200
This is priority one, aaron.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.500
Five baggies, sizable amount.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.500
Follow routine protocol?

14:34.600 --> 14:35.100
To the letter.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.400
Random sample,

14:36.500 --> 14:37.300
two of the bags.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.500
You must weight and analyze this accurately, okay?

14:41.200 --> 14:41.800
Yes, sir.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.000
And the name?

14:43.200 --> 14:44.900
Just as it appears in the report.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.000
Yes, sir.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.200
I'll find you.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.100
Thank you.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.200
- Mari?
- Eric.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.100
Hi.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.100
I thought we weren't having lunch until tomorrow.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.300
We're not.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.800
So, what's my sister doing here in the middle of the day?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.600
Eric, I, um...

15:16.100 --> 15:16.700
Eric?

15:18.200 --> 15:18.800
You got a minute?

15:29.400 --> 15:30.500
Somebody want to tell me what's going on?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.200
Marisol is in trouble.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.400
Marisol, talk to me.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.600
I-I made a buy near the pier.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.300
I intervened on the arrest.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.000
And?

15:45.900 --> 15:47.200
I lied to lieutenant Caine.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.200
I said it was just for me, but I, um...

15:49.700 --> 15:51.100
I also bought for my group.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.400
You bought for your entire cancer support group?

15:53.500 --> 15:54.900
They're in so much pain, Eric.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.400
Most of them can't get around.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.400
How much, h?

15:59.800 --> 16:01.100
Five bags total.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.900
Marisol, you realize what you've done?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.100
I did it f them.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.700
Look, I don't care who you did it for.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.200
You buy more than an ounce with intention to distribute,

16:09.300 --> 16:10.800
it gets kicked up to a felony.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.700
You could do ten years.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.300
Well-well, what do I do?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.900
Okay, here's what I want you to do.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.500
Marisol, you talk to no one,

16:18.600 --> 16:19.100
and Eric,

16:19.200 --> 16:20.200
you've got to stay away from this.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.100
Younderstand?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.100
- H, I can't let you take the fall on this one.
- Okay,

16:23.200 --> 16:24.900
I don't want you to worry about that right now.

16:25.000 --> 16:25.500
Marisol?

16:26.300 --> 16:26.800
Where-where are we going?

16:26.900 --> 16:27.800
We're going to booking.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.200
You hang in there, Eric.Come on.

16:29.900 --> 16:30.400
Right here.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.200
soy clothes--

16:39.900 --> 16:40.600
good for the environment,

16:40.700 --> 16:41.300
women love them.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.500
Everybody wins.

16:42.900 --> 16:43.600
Not you.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.700
We processed your clothes

16:45.800 --> 16:48.800
and found soy fibers from your shirt on the shirt of the victim.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.200
Paul was my student.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.500
There's nothing unusual about that.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.300
We're buddies, we're all just hanging out.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.900
Unfortunately for you,

17:04.000 --> 17:08.099
we found hundreds of fibers on your buddy's shirt that was murdered.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.700
So, what are you saying?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.700
Transfer wasn't passive.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.900
It most likely got there from some sort of friction.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.700
It tells me the two of you had an altercation.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.400
Wow.

17:20.700 --> 17:21.900
Smart and beautiful.

17:22.700 --> 17:23.900
It's a rare combination.

17:24.700 --> 17:25.900
Let's talk about the altercation.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.600
Too bad you're a woman in a man's world, you know?

17:29.600 --> 17:32.700
I bet they call you a secretary with a gun when you're not around.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.000
Actually, I do type almost as well as I shoot.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.400
Throwing a neg doesn't work on me.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
What's your beef with the victim?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.000
When paul first came to me,

17:50.100 --> 17:51.500
he couldn't pick up a check,

17:52.000 --> 17:52.800
let alone a girl.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.400
I sharpened his instincts.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.900
I turned paul into a pro.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.500
Then I find out he's going out on his own,

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
starting his own seminar.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.600
You can't do this.

18:03.800 --> 18:04.800
You can't stop me.Yeah?

18:04.900 --> 18:06.000
This is my life's work.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.300
Hey, I got my own version,

18:07.400 --> 18:08.800
and I'm going to get rich off it.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.100
I'll take you down.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.500
Yeah we argued, I admit it,

18:18.800 --> 18:19.700
but I didn't kill him.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.400
Look, I lead my first seminar in new york city tomorrow.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.700
My website's getting a thousand hits a day.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.300
You're not going anywhere, mr. Reynolds.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.200
You're a suspect in a murder investigation.

18:36.800 --> 18:37.800
hey,yan, it's calleigh.

18:37.900 --> 18:38.900
Would you do something for me?

18:40.500 --> 18:41.200
Hey, Alexx.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.100
Hey.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.700
Did you post paul sanders, yet?

18:43.800 --> 18:45.000
Just about to start.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.400
What do you need, honey?

18:46.800 --> 18:48.000
We're running cold on suspects.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.600
I just want to take another look through his things,

18:49.700 --> 18:51.000
see if I can find anything.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.500
Hmm, they're in those bags.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.300
Did he have a belt pack with him?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.000
Mm-hmm.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.800
Boy had some freaky stuff in it, too.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.800
Pack of break mints, condoms.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.300
Doesn't sound so freaky.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.000
He had a bag of lint.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.500
Oh, yeah, they hand those out at the seminars.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.400
They're like, uh,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.500
props for pickup artists.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.600
Whatever happened to dinner and a movie?

19:11.900 --> 19:12.400
I don't know.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.800
It'like a war to these guys.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.400
Well, that's just wrong.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.500
And so's this.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.900
What?What is it?

19:25.300 --> 19:27.000
He has a ring indentation.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.200
What's that tell you?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.000
Evidence of a wedding ring.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.600
Paul sanders is married?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.600
Well, that's what his finger's telling me.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.900
Let me see.Where-where is it?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.900
Band of indented skin, right there.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.100
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see that.

19:45.200 --> 19:45.900
That's interesting.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.900
You can't see it, can you?

19:48.400 --> 19:49.000
Yes, I can.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.100
Yourye's worse.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.400
Don't lie to me, Ryan.

19:51.700 --> 19:52.600
No, my eye got better.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.900
You took all the pills prescribed you?

19:55.300 --> 19:55.900
Yes.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Then it's not getting better,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.200
'cause an infection would've cleared up by now

19:59.300 --> 20:00.500
look, Alexx,

20:01.300 --> 20:02.700
I really appreciate your concern.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.500
I really do,

20:03.900 --> 20:05.400
but I'm working on a case right now.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.200
I got to find this guy's wife.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.000
Tell her she's a widow.

20:19.900 --> 20:23.100
Someone... stabbed him?

20:25.600 --> 20:26.700
With an ice pick.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.800
look, I-I know this is difficult for you, mrs. Sanders,

20:34.700 --> 20:36.800
but were you at the cl with your husband last night?

20:37.200 --> 20:37.700
What?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.600
I was at home last night.

20:45.700 --> 20:46.800
Do you mind if I...?

20:46.900 --> 20:47.400
No.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.900
How did you burn your arm?

20:52.800 --> 20:53.700
Oh, I...

20:54.100 --> 20:55.700
I had an accident in the kitchen.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.300
Oh.

20:58.700 --> 20:59.900
That's a unique burn pattern.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.800
It's caused by potassium nitrate in combination with titanium and sulfur.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.200
I don't even know what that means.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.800
Sparklers.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.600
Waitresses at the club carry them with their drink orders.

21:11.700 --> 21:12.300
It's A...

21:13.600 --> 21:15.200
sort of a signature of the place.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.600
okay, I was in the club last night,

21:32.700 --> 21:34.000
but its not like you think.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.000
Paul had to go to those clubs to do research.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.800
He was starting a similar business.

21:40.300 --> 21:40.700
We know.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.200
Or was thajust what he told you?

21:48.300 --> 21:49.800
I wanted to believe him,

21:49.900 --> 21:50.400
but...

21:51.700 --> 21:52.500
I wasn't sure,

21:52.600 --> 21:53.500
so...

21:54.300 --> 21:55.300
I followed him.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.900
When I saw him with that girl,

22:13.400 --> 22:15.700
I knew that he wasn't just doing research.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.100
I was so angry.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.100
Angry enough to stab him with an ice pick?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.200
Of course not.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.700
I was too crushed to do anything.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.300
Paul was my whole world.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.200
I just went home and cried.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.800
Weren't you worried about him when he didn't come home?

22:39.200 --> 22:41.000
I just thought he went home with a girl.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.300
So he's done this fore?

22:43.500 --> 22:44.100
No.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.300
We've only been married four months.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.100
You're newlyweds?

22:51.400 --> 22:52.200
Yes.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.100
Why?

22:57.500 --> 23:00.500
I'm gonna need you to wait here while I go look into something, okay?

23:09.700 --> 23:10.600
a wedding registry.

23:10.700 --> 23:11.400
That's a first.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.000
Need to buy a gift for someone?

23:13.100 --> 23:15.500
No, I need to see what gifts were bought for my suspect.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.400
Paul and brenda sander

23:17.600 --> 23:19.200
yeah,they were married about four months ago.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.800
Oh, did you see delko's sister in the lobby?

23:22.700 --> 23:25.000
No. I think she's in trouble again.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.100
Last thing she needs.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.100
Leukemia.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.600
Worst kind of cancer.

23:29.900 --> 23:30.600
Keep searching.

23:32.900 --> 23:33.600
Don't tell anyone this,

23:33.700 --> 23:35.000
but I think she's got a thing for H.

23:35.300 --> 23:35.900
Cooper,

23:36.000 --> 23:36.800
are you writing a blog?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.400
I got a suspect on ice.

23:38.800 --> 23:39.300
Okay.

23:40.700 --> 23:41.800
Paul and brenda sanders.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.400
I've tapped into their wedding registry.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.400
All right, about time.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.200
That's pricey stuff.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.800
Crystal punch bowl,

23:48.300 --> 23:49.200
bone china...

23:49.400 --> 23:50.100
fondue set?

23:50.200 --> 23:51.100
Who eats fondue?

23:51.400 --> 23:51.900
I do.

23:52.900 --> 23:53.800
That's my point.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.000
Wait, stop.

23:56.100 --> 23:56.700
Ice pick.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.700
800 bucks?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.700
Who pays 800 bucks for an ice pick?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.300
All that matters is it's marked "purchased"

24:02.400 --> 24:04.200
and was delivered to the newlyweds' house.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.400
There it is.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.600
Sterling silver,

24:08.700 --> 24:09.700
six inch,

24:10.200 --> 24:11.000
diamond point.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
Just like our murder weapon.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.100
Mrs. Sanders, I'm gonna be blunt.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.600
You're looking very guilty.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.600
I don't know what you mean.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.300
Looks like you used one of your wedding gifts to murder your husband.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.200
That's not true.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.600
If I get a search warrant,

24:30.200 --> 24:31.400
and I search your house,

24:32.200 --> 24:33.600
am I gonna find ice pick?

24:35.800 --> 24:36.400
Okay.

24:37.000 --> 24:37.900
Truth is,

24:38.000 --> 24:39.500
we had a burglary in our home.

24:40.300 --> 24:40.900
When?

24:41.100 --> 24:41.800
A week ago.

24:42.700 --> 24:45.400
Somebody broke into our garage where we stored all our wedding gifts.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.200
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

24:47.300 --> 24:48.600
I didn't think you'd believe me.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.000
Well, I don't now.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.300
Did you call the cops?

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
I went down to the police station,

24:52.500 --> 24:54.100
I filled out a report and everything.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.700
I need to see that report.

25:07.100 --> 25:07.800
Eric.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.100
Where's aaron?

25:11.600 --> 25:12.500
He had tgo to court.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.300
I was just looking, uh...

25:14.500 --> 25:15.800
I was looking at his results.

25:16.700 --> 25:17.500
I can see that.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.800
Tested positive for marijuana.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.500
What was the total weight of the seizure?

25:24.800 --> 25:26.300
- Over an ounce.
- Yeah.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.800
Whh makes it a felony, doesn't it?

25:29.200 --> 25:31.300
Marisol could be facing mandatory jail time.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.100
She won't make it in her condition.

25:34.200 --> 25:34.800
I agree.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.900
What she needs is a lawyer,

25:37.000 --> 25:38.700
and I've got some names, Eric.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.200
She doesn't have anything,

25:42.300 --> 25:43.200
and I'm...

25:43.400 --> 25:44.200
I'm tapped out.

25:45.300 --> 25:46.400
I'm gonna take care of it.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.300
- h, you're doing enough...
- hang on a second.

25:48.900 --> 25:49.800
It's the state attorney.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.000
- You think it's about Marisol?
- That would be my guess.

25:53.500 --> 25:54.000
Yeah.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.500
Yeah, I'll hold.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.900
How could they know already?

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
Eric, somebody must have talked.

26:25.100 --> 26:25.700
Lieutenant?

26:27.700 --> 26:28.200
Lieutenant Caine?

26:28.800 --> 26:29.500
You wanted to see me.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.200
I really would prefer if we did this in my office.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.500
Would it be okay if we did it here?

26:35.600 --> 26:36.200
Fine.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.900
Last week, Eric delko almost went down on a dope charge.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.400
This week, his sister's facing possession with intent to sell?

26:44.100 --> 26:45.200
Yes. Uh...

26:45.300 --> 26:48.100
mswest,there are extenuating circumstances in this case.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.000
Like what?

26:49.100 --> 26:49.700
The girl...

26:52.100 --> 26:53.400
the girl has cancer.

26:54.300 --> 26:57.200
And she buys to alleviate nausea from chemotherapy.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.500
That's very convenient.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.200
Well, it happens to be the truth.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.300
You don't need over an ounce to alleviate nausea.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.700
She was planning to sell.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.200
This isn't going away.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.300
Okay.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.400
Just out of curiosity,

27:10.500 --> 27:11.700
how did you hear about it?

27:13.900 --> 27:15.600
Eric delko is one of your csis.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.600
There's obviously something wrong in that family,

27:17.700 --> 27:19.800
and, by association, your lab.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.500
I hear your concern,

27:21.600 --> 27:22.800
but you're not answering my question.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.100
How did you hear about this?

27:27.400 --> 27:28.500
I won't give up my source.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.300
You have a source in my lab.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.000
Don't try and turn this on me.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.600
I'm the least of your problems.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.500
- We'll talk.
- Ms. West...

27:50.200 --> 27:51.900
So tell me,why are we back here at the crime scene?

27:53.400 --> 27:56.900
You take a look at that police report on a burglary at the sanders' house?

27:57.000 --> 27:57.600
Yeah, I did.

27:57.700 --> 27:58.300
It checked.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.800
So the wife's in the clear.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.000
For now.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.200
And our case is stalled.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.600
Well, what are we looking for, anyway?

28:09.200 --> 28:09.700
I don'T...

28:09.800 --> 28:10.900
I'm-I'm not sure.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.000
you did sweep the room already, didn't you?

28:19.100 --> 28:21.200
Yeah, which means we're probably not gonna find anything.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.200
Wh's that?

28:28.700 --> 28:33.200
That is...that is a pen.

28:33.900 --> 28:34.400
It's a pen.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.200
Cannot believe I didn't find this.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.700
The barrel is a smooth, printable surface.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.800
You use the same two fingers when you're writing--

28:45.200 --> 28:47.300
forefinger and thumb in opposing positions.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.700
So we're looking at partials.

28:49.000 --> 28:49.500
Yeah.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.900
As long as there's enough ridge detail.

29:01.000 --> 29:01.800
Karen manning?

29:02.000 --> 29:02.500
Wait.

29:04.700 --> 29:05.600
What, you know her?

29:05.700 --> 29:06.300
We've interviewed her,

29:06.400 --> 29:07.400
but that's not her name.

29:07.900 --> 29:08.500
Manning.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
Do you think she's related to the guy that found the body?

29:11.900 --> 29:13.600
You told us your name was heather larkin.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.000
Heather larkin's my pen name.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.400
So you're telling me you're a writer?

29:19.300 --> 29:21.400
I write a column for the miami globe.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.200
That's what I was doing at that club.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.100
I went undercover to do an expos?

29:26.200 --> 29:28.100
on professional pickup artists.

29:28.200 --> 29:28.700
I see.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.100
So, uh...

29:30.400 --> 29:31.400
so, it was research.

29:31.900 --> 29:32.500
Exactly.

29:33.200 --> 29:36.500
I let paul sanders pick me up so I could learn his techniques.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.300
You disgust me.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.200
Soon as my column's published,

29:40.300 --> 29:41.900
you'll never hurt another woman again.

29:42.300 --> 29:43.100
Loser!

29:43.600 --> 29:45.000
Ow! Bitch!

29:49.100 --> 29:50.100
And then he turned up dead.

29:50.900 --> 29:51.600
Not by me.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.800
How about another relative?

29:54.100 --> 29:56.200
Your brother todd was at the club last night.

29:57.000 --> 29:57.900
I didn't see him.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.000
You know, he found paul sanders' body.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.700
Are you trying to tell me you didn't know that?

30:02.500 --> 30:03.500
I had no idea.

30:03.900 --> 30:04.800
Come off it, lady.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.200
What, is he working for you?

30:06.400 --> 30:06.900
- Is he a stringer?
- No,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.800
I learned about this group from my brother.

30:09.900 --> 30:10.800
He was into it.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.700
I didn't like what it did to him.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.500
Did you confront him?

30:14.900 --> 30:15.900
I tried.He got defensive..

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
He said it was helping him,

30:17.100 --> 30:19.300
that it was changing his life.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.100
More like ruining it.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.100
They came up with this nickname,

30:23.200 --> 30:23.900
"the magician,"

30:24.000 --> 30:26.300
like he had some magical touch over women.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.700
It was disgusting.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.800
So by outing them in an expos?

30:29.900 --> 30:31.000
you were trying to save your brother.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.300
They exploit and dehumanize women.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.800
Somebody had to stop them.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.200
And you didn't see your brother there?

30:38.400 --> 30:39.000
No.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.000
And believe me,

30:40.100 --> 30:40.700
if I did,

30:40.800 --> 30:42.100
I would have told him that...

30:43.300 --> 30:44.000
told him what?

30:46.200 --> 30:48.200
That he'd become something I hate.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.200
Aaron, what'd you get?

30:55.300 --> 30:56.500
I analyzed the other three baggies,

30:56.600 --> 30:57.500
- like you asked.
- Okay.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.500
Weight of the three baggies puts the tot over an ounce.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.700
Okay, and what does that mean?

31:01.100 --> 31:02.000
There's a curveball.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.800
The first two baggies I sampled were pure marijuana.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.600
The last three, bunk.

31:06.900 --> 31:08.800
Okay, w-wait a second, wait a minute, wait.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.400
Bunk.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.600
Define "bunk."

31:11.800 --> 31:12.300
Herb.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.200
Dutch haze, hydroponic buds.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.100
All plant material, all legal.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.600
Legal.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.300
Thank you, aaron.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.400
Lieutenant.

31:21.100 --> 31:21.600
What?

31:22.900 --> 31:24.900
I'm gonna say this because I feel I have to, all right?

31:26.600 --> 31:28.900
I'm not comfortable that Eric delko was in this lab alone.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Aaron, I've already dealt with it.

31:31.200 --> 31:31.900
But thank you.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.300
H, I don't care what they say.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.900
I didn't compromise the evidence.

31:46.000 --> 31:46.600
I know that, Eric.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.900
But the state attorney is on her way up right now.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.300
H, I swear on my sister,

31:50.400 --> 31:51.700
I didn't touch a thing.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.500
I believe you.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.500
Let me work on it.

31:53.600 --> 31:54.300
Here she is.

31:59.300 --> 31:59.800
Well...

32:01.700 --> 32:03.400
that's what I call an effective source.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.200
I don't have a source,

32:04.300 --> 32:04.800
I have a case.

32:04.900 --> 32:07.000
Turns out, you don't have a case, ma'am.

32:07.900 --> 32:11.100
The product that was seized on the street is bunk.

32:12.100 --> 32:12.600
Fake?

32:12.700 --> 32:13.300
All of it?

32:13.800 --> 32:15.400
- I only need 20 grams.
- Guess what?

32:15.900 --> 32:16.700
You're not gonna have them.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.400
Was Eric del involved in this testing?

32:20.500 --> 32:21.200
He was not.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.300
But Eric delko was working in the lab when it was analyzed.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.200
He is a crime scene inveigator, ma'am.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.200
Who, just last week, popped positive for dope.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.800
Now that is common knowledge, isn't it?

32:35.600 --> 32:38.800
I will be informing the accreditation board of this anomaly.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.700
You are up for re-accreditation in the spring?

32:40.800 --> 32:41.400
Ye we are,

32:41.500 --> 32:43.300
and we will be ready for the inspection.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.100
Your lab just tampered with evidence.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.600
I'm not letting you get away with it.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.300
I have no doubt.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.400
Why would she do that?

32:54.700 --> 32:56.400
It's called career management, Eric.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.200
All right, well, what do we do?

33:02.700 --> 33:03.900
We need to find this dealer.

33:04.800 --> 33:05.400
Thought he was in the wind.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.200
Not anymore.

33:18.300 --> 33:22.400
Marisol said she scored ways from the same guy at the same place.

33:23.000 --> 33:23.900
She give you his M.O.?

33:24.600 --> 33:26.000
Yeah,he'd pull up to the park,

33:26.100 --> 33:27.900
hang out and wait for customers.

33:28.000 --> 33:28.900
Okay, so we're looking...

33:29.900 --> 33:31.100
for his calling card.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.800
Got a soda can.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.200
Maybe get some prints.

33:39.300 --> 33:40.200
Well, what do you know?

33:41.200 --> 33:41.800
Hang on.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.900
I think we'll be able to get something from that.

33:48.100 --> 33:49.600
Yes, I bet we will.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.200
come on.

33:52.900 --> 33:53.500
Any luck?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.300
Got to lick a joint to seal it.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.100
You sound like an expert.

33:57.700 --> 33:58.200
Not me.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.100
I put the dna into codis.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.200
"Keith Gifford."

34:03.400 --> 34:05.000
Priors for possession.

34:05.100 --> 34:06.600
Distribution. Assault.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.300
Give me his last known address.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.400
Report doesn't list address.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.400
It's got employers.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.100
Will that help?

34:13.600 --> 34:14.600
Yeah, it just might.

34:15.800 --> 34:16.699
What the hell's this about?

34:17.699 --> 34:19.100
You sold weed to my sister.

34:19.500 --> 34:20.300
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.500
I got a legitimate job.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.500
I don't deal.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.300
I don't think you understand the situation, keith.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.500
You're going to jail.

34:25.900 --> 34:26.400
Jail?

34:27.000 --> 34:28.199
- I'm going back to work.
- Hey.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.600
We got a baggie full of ints with your dna on it.

34:31.800 --> 34:32.600
And to my knowledge,

34:32.699 --> 34:34.699
you have three priors in this state for dealing,

34:34.900 --> 34:36.400
and you know what that means, don't you?

34:37.900 --> 34:38.900
Your ride is here.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.199
Okay... okay.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.100
What can I do?

34:44.199 --> 34:44.900
How can I fix this?

34:45.100 --> 34:45.699
For starters,

34:45.800 --> 34:48.199
you can tell the state attorney the truth about your product.

34:49.000 --> 34:49.500
What are you talking about?

34:49.600 --> 34:50.699
It's been stepped on, keith,

34:50.800 --> 34:52.100
that's what I'm talking about.

34:54.900 --> 34:55.699
What do you want to do?

34:58.800 --> 34:59.800
If I tell you the truth,

35:00.500 --> 35:01.700
will that reduce my jail time?

35:02.000 --> 35:02.900
It'll go a long way.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.100
Bring him.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.400
Business has been bad.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.900
I needed a little extra to keep me afloat,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.500
so I move a little herb.

35:19.700 --> 35:23.200
Did you, or did you not sell five baggies of marijuana to this woman?

35:24.600 --> 35:25.400
Yeah, the other day.

35:26.300 --> 35:28.100
Only, it wasn't all marijuana.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.000
What was it?

35:31.500 --> 35:34.400
Some of the bags were just some phony stuff I got off the internet.

35:34.700 --> 35:35.300
How many?

35:38.400 --> 35:39.100
A lot.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
Be specific.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.100
Three.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.200
Do you swear, under oa,

35:47.400 --> 35:50.700
that lieutenant Caine did not promise you something in exchange for this statement?

35:50.900 --> 35:51.400
No way.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.500
Look, that's how I make my money.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.000
Most of the time, people don't even notice.

35:57.400 --> 35:57.900
Great.

35:59.600 --> 36:00.400
Ms. West?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.100
Ms. West?

36:06.900 --> 36:07.400
Fine.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.200
Misdemeanor.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.000
It's off my radar.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.300
But your lab isn'T.

36:20.800 --> 36:25.400
I have never had so many suspects and so little useful evidence.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.500
Did this come from the crime scene?

36:29.100 --> 36:31.700
Um... yeah, it was on a bedside table.

36:31.800 --> 36:32.300
It's an...

36:33.600 --> 36:35.400
aromatic disbursement unit.

36:36.000 --> 36:36.500
What?

36:36.700 --> 36:38.000
Fragrances are stored on a disc,

36:38.100 --> 36:39.700
then broadcast into a rome.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.700
Like a high-tech airreshener?

36:42.000 --> 36:42.700
Yeah, exactly.

36:49.100 --> 36:49.800
it's on a timer.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.100
Why do you have that look?

36:53.400 --> 36:54.700
We may have just broke the case.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.900
Okay, I think I've got this thing figured out.

37:01.100 --> 37:02.900
There are five different fragrances per disc.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.100
And each room is dispersed for half an hour.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.700
"Country pine,

37:06.800 --> 37:07.700
jasmine spring,

37:07.800 --> 37:08.900
ocean rain,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
orange spice and sea breeze."

37:11.200 --> 37:13.200
So, each disc plays for two and a half hours.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.300
And we know what time the machine was turned on.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.200
Yeah, 9:30.

37:16.300 --> 37:16.800
Exactly.

37:16.900 --> 37:20.000
So, we know which fragrance was being disbursed at which time.

37:37.700 --> 37:38.500
you're going to love this.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.400
I had the lab check the disc,

37:39.500 --> 37:40.800
and everything's typical--

37:42.200 --> 37:43.300
except for the last scent.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.000
What is it?

37:45.400 --> 37:46.400
Human pheromones.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.200
Airborne hydrocarbon molecules.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.100
Aphrodisiac.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.500
That's all part of the seduction.

37:52.100 --> 37:55.500
Okay, so human pheromones were the last scent disbursed.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.600
Which gives us a time frame.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.500
11:30 to midnight.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Let's go bk to the shirts.

38:01.400 --> 38:01.900
Yeah.

38:02.100 --> 38:02.900
Todd manning'S.

38:03.300 --> 38:04.700
Along with everyone else in the room.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.100
How'd we do?

39:06.500 --> 39:09.700
Heather larkin's satin top was exposed to osmanthus oil,

39:09.800 --> 39:12.300
citric acid and eucalyptus.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.400
Orange spice.

39:14.100 --> 39:14.800
Yeah, exactly.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.800
Wayne reynolds' shirt had traces of champagne,

39:16.900 --> 39:18.000
cigar smoke and cologne.

39:18.700 --> 39:19.600
What about our victim?

39:21.400 --> 39:23.300
Paul sanders' shirt was exposed to smoke,

39:23.400 --> 39:25.500
sweat, orange spice...

39:27.300 --> 39:28.700
and a heavy dose of pheromones.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.300
What about todd manning?

39:32.100 --> 39:34.200
He didn't discover the body till around 1:00.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.700
He was saturated in pheromones.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.400
Which we know were being disbursed into the room between 11:30 and midnight.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.100
Which was right around the time of the ath.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.400
Todd manning was in that room at the time of the murder.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.200
I'll call mdpd.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.400
Have them pick up the pickup aist.

39:50.000 --> 39:50.500
Great.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.200
Hey,

39:53.400 --> 39:55.300
could've happened when I brought that chick up there.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.900
You-you can't prove a thing.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.100
Actually, we can.

39:58.300 --> 39:58.900
Here's the thing...

40:01.500 --> 40:02.800
that aroma dispenser...

40:04.700 --> 40:05.600
it was on a timer.

40:06.500 --> 40:10.400
We were able to pinpoint exactly what time the pheromones were disbursed into the room.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.700
We have an instrument called a z-nose,

40:26.800 --> 40:29.700
and it will tell us specifically what odors are found in your shirt.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Your clothes were saturated in pheromones between the hours of 11:30 and midnight.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.900
That's when our M.E. Tells us the victim was murdered.

40:42.000 --> 40:42.600
Dude!

40:43.300 --> 40:44.500
That girl's my sister, man.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.400
What'd you do to her?

40:45.800 --> 40:46.800
Did her, dude.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.800
She was begging me to do it again.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.200
Can't wait.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.300
Chick's a winning horse.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.300
That's messed up, man.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
She's my sister.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.700
Every chick is somebody's sister.

40:56.800 --> 40:57.700
Get over it.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.100
you didn't bring the ice pick?

41:20.900 --> 41:21.800
Sanders brought it.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.000
It was part of the seminar.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.500
Bring your own hh-end stuff to impress the women.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.600
He brought one of his wedding gifts?

41:29.700 --> 41:30.200
Yeah.

41:30.800 --> 41:31.600
Dude was cold.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.500
Now you know why I did it.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.300
A man's got to stand up for his sister.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.000
I mean, blood is blood, you know?

41:39.400 --> 41:39.900
Yeah.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.600
Except paul sanders lied to you.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.000
What?

41:44.800 --> 41:46.100
He didn't "close the sale."

41:48.100 --> 41:49.100
What are you talking about?

41:50.500 --> 41:52.100
Your sister didn't let him touch her.

41:52.700 --> 41:53.800
He lied to save face.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.100
She was there to save you...

41:57.500 --> 41:58.300
magic man.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.000
Oh, god.

42:09.000 --> 42:09.500
The irony is,

42:09.600 --> 42:11.700
where you're going, you may end up being the target.

42:35.100 --> 42:35.800
Lieutenant Caine?

42:37.300 --> 42:37.800
Lieutenant?

42:39.700 --> 42:40.300
Marisol.

42:41.000 --> 42:41.800
I-I don't understand--

42:41.900 --> 42:42.600
they released me.

42:43.300 --> 42:43.800
Well...

42:44.400 --> 42:45.700
that can't happen again, can it?

42:47.400 --> 42:48.100
Point taken.

42:48.200 --> 42:48.800
Okay.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.300
Lieutenant, how can i ever thank you?

42:52.400 --> 42:53.500
That's not necessary.

42:55.800 --> 42:56.800
Could I make you dinner?

42:57.400 --> 42:58.500
It's the least that I could do.

43:00.500 --> 43:01.000
you know...

43:02.600 --> 43:03.800
you know,I don't, uh...

43:04.200 --> 43:05.800
I don't think that would be a very good idea.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.700
- Because my brother works for you.
- Yeah.

43:11.500 --> 43:12.400
That's a part of it.

43:13.300 --> 43:13.800
You know?

43:14.100 --> 43:14.800
It's just dinner.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.700
You know, I make a mean ropa vieja.

43:19.900 --> 43:21.200
- You do, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.200
Um... okay.

43:25.300 --> 43:28.700
Um... what time were you thinking?

43:29.800 --> 43:30.400
Eight o'clock?

43:31.800 --> 43:32.600
Eight o'clock.

43:33.000 --> 43:33.700
Great.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.300
I am looking forward to it.

43:35.900 --> 43:36.600
See you then.
