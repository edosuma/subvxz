WEBVTT

01:33.468 --> 01:34.469
Who is it?

01:35.637 --> 01:36.680
It's your brother.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.747
Look, I left this shitty place.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.541
And I have worked hard to make my music.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.544
To be an artist,
to have nothing to do with you.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.548
And then two fucking psychopaths
come out of nowhere.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.801
They kidnap me, drug me, and torture me.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.013
All because of you, asshole.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.932
You didn't do shit!

02:20.474 --> 02:22.017
I sent some people

02:23.143 --> 02:24.186
but they were killed.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.357
And if I said you were a fucking traitor

02:29.316 --> 02:30.734
it was to protect your ass.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.529
What did you want me to say?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.489
That you're my little brother?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.282
That I love you?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.118
They would've killed you like an asshole.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.079
You don't love anyone.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.916
If that's what you think...

02:47.668 --> 02:48.669
why are you here?

02:58.887 --> 03:02.224
I came here so we could talk
like civilized people.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.727
Like grown-ups.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.312
Talk.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.486
Let the American woman go.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.906
Her family told me that she's innocent.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.492
You have the power.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.911
Release her, forget about her.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.288
Those guys are rats.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.583
They're fucking killers.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.461
But what would you know?

03:33.380 --> 03:36.008
For 10 years
you've been living the good life.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.177
Traveling.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.387
Chasing ass.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.432
Playing your music.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.648
They electrocuted my balls.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.526
You think I did that to you?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.698
Do you think I did that to you?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.418
Can you or can't you do something?

04:22.346 --> 04:24.556
Nice road for a sports car.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.977
Where are we?

04:39.238 --> 04:40.239
No.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.543
Now, which one is you? Which one?

04:52.543 --> 04:54.837
I told you who the fuck I am!

05:19.695 --> 05:20.904
Snow ball!

05:34.251 --> 05:37.462
Lay down! You stay the fuck down!

05:38.088 --> 05:39.089
Shut up!

05:39.089 --> 05:40.924
Shut your mouth!

05:40.924 --> 05:42.050
Stop!

05:43.886 --> 05:45.220
Mom!

05:45.220 --> 05:46.388
You're gonna fucking learn!

05:48.223 --> 05:49.892
<i>Fucking listen to me.</i>

05:53.937 --> 05:55.147
Do it.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.949
Hey.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.662
I'm bad.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.331
I'm so bad.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.209
You're not bad.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.844
You're Bambi.

09:32.656 --> 09:33.866
Yeah. Let him in.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.695
<i>Hola</i>.
-Hey, man.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.447
You ready to make some money?

10:13.947 --> 10:14.948
I don't know, man.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.784
Are you sure it's okay?

10:18.493 --> 10:19.494
It's all good.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.872
Come meet some of my friends.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.833
Come on.
-Okay.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.550
You're safe here, bro.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.469
Are you sure?
-Yeah. I'm gonna look after you.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.470
Don't you worry.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.723
A mosquito.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.184
Only the female bites.

10:42.184 --> 10:47.397
<i>You know, she is the leading cause
of death in human history?</i>

10:47.397 --> 10:49.525
<i>More so than any other cause.</i>

10:50.984 --> 10:55.572
<i>Malaria. Zika. West Nile.
Yellow Fever. Dengue.</i>

10:55.572 --> 10:56.698
Mind your head.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.866
<i>You admire it.</i>

10:59.076 --> 11:01.620
I do. Yeah.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.415
<i>Some people think
she may have killed the dinosaurs.</i>

11:07.084 --> 11:11.505
This is Javi. He knows the place better
than anyone. And he's one of us now.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.549
You've seen this video?

11:13.549 --> 11:16.301
You gotta watch it, man.
You gotta see this.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.263
Hey, Javi. <i>Mucho gusto</i>.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.431
<i>She's the undisputed killer of man.</i>

11:21.431 --> 11:22.975
The destroyer of worlds.

11:24.059 --> 11:28.522
She's fed on both saints, emperors.
Young, old. Black, white. Male, female.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.774
<i>She doesn't discriminate.
It's all for blood.</i>

11:30.774 --> 11:32.568
She's lost it. She's not well, man.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.861
It's all for survival.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.196
Yeah. Well,
it doesn't even sound like her, brother.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.156
She's traumatized.
-Listen--

11:38.156 --> 11:40.576
This is the beginning
of serious mental illness, dude.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.453
Yeah. We got a bigger problem.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.540
Tell him what you told me. It's okay.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.377
There is a rumor in the prison...

11:52.880 --> 11:55.382
that Amber is going to be executed.

11:57.134 --> 12:00.888
Tariq wants revenge for what you did
to his brother.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.223
I-- They don't want you
coming to rescue her.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.851
When?

12:06.435 --> 12:09.146
I don't know, man. Maybe in a few days.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.440
Tomás doesn't want to do it,
but eventually,

12:12.566 --> 12:13.775
it would happen, you know.

12:13.775 --> 12:14.985
Is it only Tariq?

12:14.985 --> 12:17.905
Anybody else have the authority
to order her execution?

12:17.905 --> 12:19.364
He's the boss, man.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.622
I'll call Mitch.

12:26.622 --> 12:27.706
I'll handle it.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.333
<i>Gracias</i>, Javi.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.085
<i>Gracias, amigo.</i>

13:17.089 --> 13:18.298
Okay, Amber.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.218
Third time is the charm, hmm?

13:41.488 --> 13:42.990
Is it because of Hildy?

13:44.449 --> 13:45.450
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:46.243 --> 13:48.036
Is that why you're not cooperating?

13:49.454 --> 13:50.664
Why then, Amber?

13:51.582 --> 13:54.459
Because you drugged me
with the wrong compound, Tommy.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.463
Some kind of hallucinogen.

13:59.006 --> 14:03.635
I've just been having these really vivid
daydreams of you being blown to pieces.

14:05.554 --> 14:09.391
See, this drug, whatever it is,
it doesn't make me afraid of you.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.022
Okay.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.461
Today is Monday, Amber.

14:41.173 --> 14:44.009
This here, this day is Saturday.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.473
It's a national holiday and it's also the
day I was told I'm supposed to kill you.

14:50.682 --> 14:54.228
I don't want to kill you, but I will.
Saturday.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.189
This is the day that you're going to die.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.108
Please nod if you understand.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.073
I'll take that as a "yes".

17:01.563 --> 17:04.066
<i>Hi. Your name, please?</i>
-<i>I'm not on the list.</i>

17:04.066 --> 17:08.403
I'm here to see Eric Haas II.
I'm his in-law. This is an emergency.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.446
I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't help you.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.241
Maggie Chesborough. He'll know.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.367
Ray?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.452
Ma'am, is there a problem?

17:15.452 --> 17:18.288
You want me to make a scene?
Okay, I'll make a scene.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.124
Eric Haas, get down here.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.086
Ma'am, I work for Mr. Haas.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.588
He's not here right now. Can I help you?
-I doubt it.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.298
Mr. Haas?
-Ma'am?

17:29.466 --> 17:31.468
Turn around and wait for me
at the bottom of the stairs

17:31.468 --> 17:32.678
or I'm gonna call the Sheriff.

17:33.262 --> 17:34.263
Please, ma'am.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.642
Go on. It'll be okay.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.337
Hi, boss. Yeah, she's right here.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.507
<i>Well, this is a pleasant surprise.</i>

18:11.091 --> 18:12.801
Are you really not here?

18:12.801 --> 18:16.263
I flew back from Colombia
and drove all the way here to see you.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.265
I'm here now, Maggie.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.935
Okay. The boys are in trouble down there.

18:23.061 --> 18:26.690
They've turned into criminals,
kidnapping people in broad daylight.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.525
No, that's insane.

18:31.570 --> 18:34.740
Your man, Roy, is dead.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.326
Maggie, have you been taking your pills?

18:37.326 --> 18:40.245
You don't believe me? Call your son.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.041
They're off the rails.
They are on the warpath.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.585
There's nothing I can do
if he wants to throw away his life.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.254
I told him to stay home
and let the professionals go,

18:49.254 --> 18:51.632
and he said, "Fuck off, old man."

18:54.968 --> 19:01.683
You know, our obligations to our children
do not end when they're unkind to us.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.188
<i>They need a force multiplier.</i>

19:06.855 --> 19:08.524
<i>A force multiplier.</i>

19:08.524 --> 19:11.860
I didn't know you
were such an expert on military strategy.

19:12.444 --> 19:17.533
Every grandfather, every father,
every single blessed son in my family tree

19:17.533 --> 19:21.745
has served in the United States military
since the days of Robert E. Lee.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.706
And before that,
my blood fought the Apaches.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.585
So, damn right, I know something
about military strategy.

19:29.628 --> 19:30.629
<i>Send help.</i>

19:31.296 --> 19:32.965
Protect your kin.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.912
Any ideas?

20:09.126 --> 20:12.004
Amber, it's Thursday.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.339
In 48 hours...

20:16.675 --> 20:18.760
I'm going to have to kill you.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.725
We're wasting the last
of our precious time.

20:26.351 --> 20:30.022
And I have to go to Caracas,
and I have to give a report.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.073
This is the time to move.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.381
Amber?

21:05.557 --> 21:06.642
El Dorado.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.521
<i>Qué?</i>

21:11.772 --> 21:12.814
El Dorado.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.652
Dorado?

21:19.196 --> 21:21.698
Take her off the program.
We are wasting medicine.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.117
<i>Are we falling asleep or what?</i>

21:26.954 --> 21:29.581
This party is getting a little bit boring,

21:29.581 --> 21:32.709
don't you think?
Shall we make it more interesting?

21:34.086 --> 21:37.422
Shall I jump
in this fucking freezing water?

21:37.422 --> 21:38.465
Jump!

21:38.465 --> 21:40.926
Fuck it. Let's jump! Here I go!

21:40.926 --> 21:42.219
Should I do it?

22:08.120 --> 22:09.705
What are you doing up here?

22:10.956 --> 22:12.374
Are you suicidal?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.251
Save me.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.712
Oh, fuck.

22:17.296 --> 22:19.798
That wasn't funny. Sorry.

22:22.134 --> 22:25.012
Cool watch.
Did your daddy buy that for you?

22:25.012 --> 22:27.973
You know, you're, like, the only girl
at this party who's not rich.

22:27.973 --> 22:31.101
<i>And I bet you got a daddy
with a shotgun too</i>

22:31.101 --> 22:33.103
<i>somewhere in Tennessee.</i>
-<i>Georgia.</i>

22:33.812 --> 22:37.524
No daddy. But I got a brother
who knows his way around a crossbow.

22:38.901 --> 22:39.985
Primitive. I like it.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.655
<i>Actually, you should meet him.</i>

22:44.448 --> 22:46.200
<i>Why? So he can kick my ass?</i>

22:46.200 --> 22:48.327
<i>No, 'cause I can tell you've got a problem</i>

22:48.327 --> 22:50.245
<i>with finding meaning in your life.</i>

22:50.245 --> 22:53.665
He deals with guys like you all the time.
You know, lost souls.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.252
<i>Is he a therapist?</i>

23:00.088 --> 23:01.340
Special Forces.

23:08.722 --> 23:10.140
Wow.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.517
You weren't kidding, huh?
-Come on.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.352
This is legit redneck.

23:13.352 --> 23:15.479
Hey.
-Hey.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.650
Shut up.
-Hey, man.

23:20.317 --> 23:22.444
Sorry, man.
-Just give me your fucking hand.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.446
Anyone who's good with my sister,
is good with me.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.075
Why don't you take a go?

23:28.075 --> 23:32.162
Now, the biggest thing when you're holding
a knife and there's blood and slippery,

23:32.162 --> 23:34.957
is you make sure you cut the fucking deer
and not your fingers.

23:36.959 --> 23:38.794
Cut down here.
You'll feel where the hardness is,

23:38.794 --> 23:40.420
you'll end up with a nice loin.
-You can feel it?

24:12.286 --> 24:13.745
Hey!

24:24.381 --> 24:25.507
Bambi?

24:31.180 --> 24:32.181
Is that you?

24:33.182 --> 24:34.683
Hey, Bug. It's me.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.269
How'd you get in here?

24:37.269 --> 24:38.729
That's what I do, kiddo.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.319
Why do you look so down?

24:49.072 --> 24:50.949
A little deprivation is no big deal.

24:54.244 --> 24:55.245
No food?

25:00.417 --> 25:04.963
When we hit Tora Bora to hunt bin Laden,
we had to choose.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.175
Carry bullets or carry food.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.472
I lost 36 pounds in two weeks.

25:17.434 --> 25:18.477
It's just mental.

25:19.353 --> 25:20.896
<i>It's just mental.</i>

25:23.524 --> 25:27.194
This isn't real. It's a hallucination.

25:30.989 --> 25:34.701
Well,
the good thing is nobody can kill me.

25:43.335 --> 25:44.336
Bambi?

25:57.474 --> 25:59.476
Welcome to my home away from home.

26:00.519 --> 26:01.520
Yeah. What's up?

26:02.145 --> 26:04.231
Bambi wanted me to talk to you
about the exfil.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.735
Is this the condition?

26:08.735 --> 26:12.155
Tell your guys it'll make them safer.
-Is that true?

26:13.657 --> 26:16.243
It's true that, if you wear those patches
and present as Colombian military,

26:16.243 --> 26:17.327
I can get you out.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.791
Bambi agreed to this?

26:23.917 --> 26:25.252
You're the last domino.

26:26.795 --> 26:27.963
Fuck me.

26:29.381 --> 26:32.050
You're turning this
into a false flag operation, huh?

26:33.886 --> 26:36.346
You're using us to create instability
on the border.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.015
I am not doing anything at all.

26:38.515 --> 26:40.434
You asked for an exfil, all right?

26:40.434 --> 26:43.520
That takes dedicated resources.
Backside support.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.940
I have to get up on Colombia's comms.
Reposition satellites.

26:47.733 --> 26:49.151
Peacetime, that's a no.

26:49.151 --> 26:50.444
Everyone's constipated.

26:51.153 --> 26:53.238
State of emergency, things get looser.

26:53.238 --> 26:54.573
Now, give me a little war...

26:56.575 --> 26:57.868
the juices start to flow.

27:09.505 --> 27:10.631
You're right.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.759
It's just straight.

27:56.802 --> 27:57.803
Gentlemen!

27:57.803 --> 28:01.181
Everyone down quickly, I don't want
anyone sleeping. We don't have time.

28:07.479 --> 28:08.564
You Tiburon?

28:09.064 --> 28:10.649
<i>Sí, señor.</i>
-<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

28:11.400 --> 28:12.442
What have you been told?

28:12.442 --> 28:13.819
Just you are the boss.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.030
Good.

28:36.717 --> 28:37.718
We're good.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.568
Raise your hand if you speak English.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.072
Okay, that's good.

29:00.157 --> 29:02.618
So, first things first.

29:02.618 --> 29:07.789
Nobody, not even your family,
should know you're involved in this, okay?

29:07.789 --> 29:09.958
You all need to think long
and hard about the money.

29:10.751 --> 29:15.297
When we get Amber, there's gonna be
a bonus on top of your initial salary.

29:16.340 --> 29:19.801
If that's your only motivation,
then y'all need to reconsider.

29:19.801 --> 29:23.680
Because we may ask you to do something
for which there is no price.

29:26.725 --> 29:29.353
We value civilian lives.

29:29.353 --> 29:33.649
But make no mistake, we're bringing
my wife home no matter what.

29:34.233 --> 29:36.401
He and I, we're here for family.

29:36.401 --> 29:38.278
We're here to save an innocent woman.

29:38.904 --> 29:42.950
A daughter, a wife and a sister.

29:43.700 --> 29:47.246
You should be here for honor, for glory.

29:47.913 --> 29:50.290
Doing something fucking meaningful
with your life.

29:51.375 --> 29:55.546
Now, that may sound cheesy to some of you.
We don't really give a shit.

29:56.255 --> 30:00.259
If it does, you can leave right now.
No hard feelings.

30:00.259 --> 30:02.970
They're fighting to save their family.

30:03.345 --> 30:06.223
We need to be here for honor.

30:08.183 --> 30:10.519
If you're not, leave.

30:10.519 --> 30:13.188
Understood?
-Understood.

30:13.981 --> 30:15.148
Good.

30:15.148 --> 30:18.318
We've labeled the buildings 1 through 8.

30:18.318 --> 30:20.487
As you can see, the place is huge.

30:20.487 --> 30:25.742
My team, Alpha, will come in
on the north side with building 0-7.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.996
We'll clear that. Set an overwatch.

30:28.996 --> 30:31.915
I'm taking Bravo team across
to the west side of the lake.

30:31.915 --> 30:36.795
Oso, you're leading Charlie team coming in
on the south side near guard tower 2.

30:36.795 --> 30:40.215
You set your overwatch
on the roof of building 0-4.

30:40.215 --> 30:44.845
Tiburon, you'll take Delta team
on the east side and cover the main gate.

30:44.845 --> 30:49.349
Once all teams are in their set points,
we'll start at 0-1,

30:49.349 --> 30:53.312
which Javi has confirmed
connects to the prison, 0-2.

30:53.312 --> 30:57.983
There's maybe 200 families
living and working there.

30:58.650 --> 31:02.154
<i>The Narcos keep watch
over every single one.</i>

31:02.154 --> 31:05.157
<i>It's a self sustainable city.
No one is allowed to leave.</i>

31:05.157 --> 31:08.535
Wait a sec, you said 200 families?

31:09.036 --> 31:09.995
At least 200.

31:09.995 --> 31:13.457
How do we find her
with so many people there?

31:13.457 --> 31:14.625
Especially at night.

31:14.625 --> 31:17.127
<i>We're gonna be
using these ultra quiet drones.</i>

31:17.127 --> 31:20.255
<i>Prototype, next-generation technology.</i>

31:20.255 --> 31:22.591
<i>Now, the drones cannot locate Amber,</i>

31:22.591 --> 31:25.260
<i>but they can distinguish friend from foe.</i>

31:26.303 --> 31:29.097
<i>They have the ability to detect firearms.</i>

31:29.681 --> 31:32.476
<i>So if this person here
or here had a firearm,</i>

31:32.476 --> 31:34.645
<i>they'd be blinking red, not blue.</i>

31:36.355 --> 31:39.733
<i>There are two bad things
that can happen on this mission.</i>

31:39.733 --> 31:42.361
<i>Number one, we get compromised.</i>

31:43.070 --> 31:46.406
<i>The other bad thing can happen
is we can't find her.</i>

31:50.702 --> 31:53.163
<i>When we go in, we will use stealth.</i>

31:53.872 --> 31:54.915
<i>We will use surprise.</i>

31:54.915 --> 31:58.168
<i>And any chance of discovery needs
to be dealt with immediately.</i>

31:58.168 --> 32:00.546
<i>Because there is no way
we can safely search</i>

32:00.546 --> 32:04.800
thousands of square feet of interior space
within our mission parameters.

32:04.800 --> 32:09.805
We cannot get into a prolonged gunfight
with them, or we will lose.

32:09.805 --> 32:11.390
<i>The good news is,</i>

32:11.390 --> 32:12.724
<i>we know where she is.</i>

32:13.308 --> 32:17.604
<i>She's gonna be where she always is,
in building 0-2, or the cocaine lab.</i>

32:18.814 --> 32:22.442
<i>And we have that on good authority
from our human intelligence.</i>

32:22.442 --> 32:24.069
He's gonna become your new best friend.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.158
<i>She's kept in the prison every night.</i>

32:33.453 --> 32:36.039
Bravo team
is going to search building 0-1.

32:36.039 --> 32:39.501
We expect them to encounter
an accountant who may be working late.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.628
He will be subdued quietly,

32:41.628 --> 32:44.089
and then they will proceed
to search building 0-2,

32:44.089 --> 32:48.051
the first and the second floor,
where they will locate Amber.

32:48.051 --> 32:51.180
At which point the teams
will begin to withdraw.

32:51.180 --> 32:53.432
Bravo team will retrace its steps.

32:53.432 --> 32:56.351
Overwatch positions go back
to where they started from,

32:56.351 --> 32:59.062
and we pull out
without anybody being the wiser.

32:59.062 --> 33:02.482
Now, it is very important that
we preserve these overwatch positions.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.611
Because if we lose them, we cannot search.

33:05.611 --> 33:09.198
Now, we're gonna put on these uniforms
and Colombian tags.

33:09.198 --> 33:13.243
From now on,
this is a Colombian military op.

33:13.827 --> 33:18.582
'Cause we believe they will fold faster
if they think that we're Colombian army.

33:19.333 --> 33:20.584
Now, I want you to say it in Spanish.

33:20.584 --> 33:22.377
We are Colombian Military.

33:22.377 --> 33:23.837
Exactly. Say it.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.839
We are Colombian Military.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.468
<i>We gotta move fast though.</i>

33:29.468 --> 33:31.720
<i>We only have 48 minutes to do this job.</i>

33:31.720 --> 33:36.266
At this point, they will get their chance
to call the VZ military for support.

33:37.809 --> 33:42.606
If anybody gets jammed up,
the mission continues. We wait for nobody.

33:42.606 --> 33:46.443
Check your gear.
Study your maps. Learn the layout cold.

33:46.443 --> 33:48.028
We launch tonight.

33:53.659 --> 33:57.538
You know that we are 100% in the business.

33:57.538 --> 34:01.333
I think the important thing that we bring
to the table now, with us here,

34:01.708 --> 34:04.795
is our connections with the most
important people in Venezuela.

34:09.967 --> 34:13.262
That bullshit of bourgeois connections,

34:13.262 --> 34:16.223
hanging out with the elite, the powerful,

34:16.223 --> 34:17.724
that was in the past.

34:18.809 --> 34:20.768
Yes, that is true.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.146
We are the elite now.

34:23.772 --> 34:26.525
Let's speak clearly here.

34:27.359 --> 34:29.987
Are you or are you not
with the government?

34:29.987 --> 34:31.905
Is there or isn't there money
for the government?

34:32.906 --> 34:35.784
I'm gonna tell you again,
for the third time

34:35.784 --> 34:39.871
we are 100% in it.
-Wow.

34:40.706 --> 34:42.248
Revolution, yes or no?

34:42.248 --> 34:44.751
Yes, all the way!

34:44.751 --> 34:47.754
Three hours going in circles with this.

34:52.301 --> 34:53.217
The final strike.

34:53.217 --> 34:56.013
Please, speaking about the final strike,

34:57.222 --> 35:00.184
I can't with the topic of bullfights.

35:00.184 --> 35:03.145
It's become a religion for my husband.

35:03.145 --> 35:05.689
The bullfights are better than religion.

35:05.689 --> 35:08.192
What do you think, Tariq?
Does it offend you?

35:09.276 --> 35:11.320
Offend me?

35:11.320 --> 35:14.740
I don't know a thing about bullfighting.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.075
You have to come
to the bullfights with me.

35:17.075 --> 35:22.414
Bullfighting to me is too violent.

35:22.414 --> 35:25.334
I may have thousands of defects

35:27.044 --> 35:28.504
but I'm not violent, no.

35:28.504 --> 35:29.755
Never.

35:29.755 --> 35:31.840
You don't like violence?

35:31.840 --> 35:33.383
Is that right, Momo?

35:34.051 --> 35:35.469
He doesn't like violence?

35:37.179 --> 35:39.264
I've never liked violence.
-No?

35:41.225 --> 35:42.601
Does blood scare you, Tariq?

35:42.601 --> 35:44.436
You're being funny.

35:44.436 --> 35:48.482
Are you scared of the bull's blood,
the horns?

35:48.482 --> 35:49.942
He's being funny.

35:49.942 --> 35:52.444
This guy's an animal!

35:54.655 --> 35:56.073
You're being funny.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.035
Come on, what's wrong?

36:01.203 --> 36:02.704
What's wrong with you?

36:03.413 --> 36:05.874
Calm down. Look, he's not violent.

36:05.874 --> 36:09.461
Sit down.

36:13.423 --> 36:14.925
I apologize.

36:19.930 --> 36:22.349
People around here forget who is the boss.

36:28.689 --> 36:29.898
Well, cheers!

36:31.316 --> 36:33.235
Long live the revolution.

36:33.235 --> 36:35.654
For good and new things to come.

36:36.071 --> 36:38.657
Nothing like doing business with friends.

36:38.657 --> 36:41.910
Cheers to all the good things ahead.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.956
I'm really happy
to have you back, brother.

36:46.456 --> 36:49.293
My apologies about what happened up there.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.420
But that idiot got stupid.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.005
That's normal.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.548
Brothers fight.

36:54.548 --> 36:57.926
We always fight for bullshit reasons.
Even us, too.

36:58.218 --> 37:01.221
Yes, but you always start.
-All right then.

37:01.221 --> 37:03.807
That may be, but who saves your ass?

37:03.807 --> 37:05.058
Me.

37:31.835 --> 37:32.836
Tariq.

37:43.805 --> 37:46.141
Yeah.
-<i>It's done. You go tonight.</i>

37:57.611 --> 37:58.987
Tariq is off the board.

37:59.571 --> 38:00.614
Good.

38:09.790 --> 38:12.000
We should be offering
these guys more money.

38:12.918 --> 38:13.961
Nah, it was enough.

38:16.463 --> 38:18.215
For what we're asking them to do?

38:19.132 --> 38:21.802
Unfortunately, life is cheap down here.

38:22.678 --> 38:25.764
The money we gave them, we can
have them for a month of gunslinging.

38:26.473 --> 38:27.933
We're only asking for one night.

38:35.274 --> 38:38.110
Can I ask you a question
I never asked before?

38:39.278 --> 38:40.279
Sure.

38:42.739 --> 38:43.740
Why'd you join?

38:45.993 --> 38:48.078
What?
-I mean, you got all that money.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.163
Do what the fuck you want.

38:52.666 --> 38:55.210
Why did you want to fuck around
with us in the military?

38:56.086 --> 38:57.754
You know the answer to that.

38:58.589 --> 39:00.924
No. Actually, I don't.

39:06.388 --> 39:07.389
What?

39:12.352 --> 39:13.896
It was because of you.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.525
I looked up to you.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.321
Why?

39:22.946 --> 39:27.367
Fuck, man. I need to tell you something.

39:30.913 --> 39:34.166
I didn't really fuck up
with Drifter the way you think I did.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.794
So, you're saying Drifter
was in a survivable state?

39:41.757 --> 39:42.758
Maybe.

39:44.092 --> 39:45.093
I don't think so.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.140
But ultimately it didn't matter,

39:50.140 --> 39:54.019
because I had to choose about getting
him or pulling you off the mountain.

39:58.273 --> 40:01.235
This has been eating me alive, man.

40:02.194 --> 40:04.613
And filling me
with a coldness towards you.

40:09.368 --> 40:13.539
You know, I don't understand.
Why couldn't you get us both?

40:16.875 --> 40:18.627
<i>Drifter was on the south side.</i>

40:18.627 --> 40:22.589
<i>If I ran to him, I wasn't able
to double back and get you</i>

40:22.589 --> 40:24.842
<i>because the Taliban
were maneuvering on our flank.</i>

40:24.842 --> 40:26.718
Yeah.
-And they would've pinned me with Drifter.

40:28.762 --> 40:30.180
And once I was in his position,

40:30.180 --> 40:32.599
the only way off that mountain
was the south side,

40:33.684 --> 40:36.520
which would have meant leaving you behind.

40:36.520 --> 40:40.399
You could've come for me, and then
we could've gotten Drifter together.

40:40.899 --> 40:41.900
No.

40:45.696 --> 40:46.738
There was no time.

40:51.243 --> 40:53.453
I've been doing this for 20 years,
you know.

40:54.872 --> 40:56.498
Deployed 14 times.

40:57.332 --> 41:00.252
Eight confirmed kills. I've been given
every award you can think of.

41:01.920 --> 41:06.383
And I'm telling you, as God is my witness,
one of you guys would have died that day.

41:07.593 --> 41:09.094
No fucking doubt about it.

41:17.644 --> 41:19.771
Shit, man. I don't know what to say. I--

41:25.652 --> 41:26.820
I love you, man.

41:30.157 --> 41:31.408
I loved Drifter.

41:32.951 --> 41:34.870
I guess I wish you would have saved him.

41:36.455 --> 41:37.873
He had two kids, you know.

41:42.085 --> 41:46.840
He comes home. Yes or no?

41:48.634 --> 41:49.635
Yeah.

41:51.553 --> 41:53.847
Sometimes I wish
I would have saved Drifter too.

42:19.957 --> 42:22.292
Good luck. See you there.
-<i>Gracias.</i>
