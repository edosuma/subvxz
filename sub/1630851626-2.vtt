WEBVTT

00:02.437 --> 00:05.135
Previously onB Positive...So, my body's not gonna
reject the kidney?

00:05.179 --> 00:07.137
If it was going to,
it would have happened by now.

00:07.181 --> 00:09.487
Drew, we did it.We sure did.

00:09.531 --> 00:12.012
I had something to do with it,
but okay.

00:12.055 --> 00:15.015
When you're done in here,
strip the bed in 206

00:15.058 --> 00:16.929
and toss the mattress.Oh, no.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.496
Mr. Knudsen?LUDLUM: Yeah.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.497
Heart attack on the toilet.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.760
[exhales]
That's so sad.

00:21.804 --> 00:24.198
He was always constipated.
It was bound to happen.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.941
I really liked him.LUDLUM: Forgot.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.508
Gina, Knudsen

00:30.552 --> 00:32.597
apparently left something
in his will for you.

00:32.641 --> 00:33.859
You're kidding.LUDLUM: No.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.252
Expect a call from a lawyer.

00:35.296 --> 00:39.169
So, $24 million?

00:39.213 --> 00:40.040
Give or take.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.174
[shudders]

00:44.218 --> 00:45.567
A-Are you okay?

00:46.916 --> 00:50.050
I just had a little orgasm.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.226
What's going on?

00:53.227 --> 00:55.707
[exhales]
I'm in love with Gina.

00:55.751 --> 00:59.059
[high-pitched]:
What?

00:59.102 --> 01:01.278
She's the one. I'm sure of it.

01:01.322 --> 01:05.108
Sorry to bother you. I just
didn't know who else to go to.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.892
You chose wisely.

01:06.936 --> 01:09.417
Though that may be
the bedtime bong hit talking.

01:10.418 --> 01:11.984
What's going on?

01:12.028 --> 01:14.596
Well, uh, ever
since the surgery,

01:14.639 --> 01:17.294
I've felt closer to
Gina than I used to.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.557
There's a... connection.

01:19.601 --> 01:20.819
Mm-hmm.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.647
That sounds a little judgy.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.214
Mm-hmm.

01:24.258 --> 01:27.087
This is for real.
I-I think about her constantly.

01:27.130 --> 01:30.090
Every time I see her,
I feel... complete.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.830
Like she's the
yin to my yang.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.571
The hand to my glove.
The J.Lo to...

01:33.615 --> 01:35.921
any number of people.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.402
Okay, you need to be careful.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.100
A lot of people
who get transplants

01:40.143 --> 01:42.102
develop feelings
for their donor.Yeah, I get that,

01:42.145 --> 01:44.016
but that's not what this is.Think about it.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.931
You literally owe
Gina your life.

01:45.975 --> 01:48.238
It's easy to confuse that
with love.Oh, please.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.022
I know the difference
between love and gratitude.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.589
Gratitude comes after sex.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.287
There's been no sex.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.637
Shocking.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.422
Has Gina ever said or done

01:58.466 --> 02:00.685
anything to make you think
she feels the same way?

02:00.729 --> 02:03.123
Why is that important?

02:03.166 --> 02:05.125
What about Adriana?

02:05.168 --> 02:06.038
What about her?

02:06.082 --> 02:08.040
Aren't you a couple?

02:08.084 --> 02:10.130
Mm-hmm.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.002
My advice--

02:13.045 --> 02:15.526
slow down before
you do something you regret.

02:15.570 --> 02:18.529
That is not
what I wanted to hear.All right.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.965
Where do you see this going?

02:20.009 --> 02:22.707
Well, I don't want to
get ahead of myself,

02:22.751 --> 02:24.535
but if things go
the way I hope,

02:24.579 --> 02:27.669
our wedding cake could be
in the shape of a kidney.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.367
Wow.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.064
Pretty cool, huh?

02:32.108 --> 02:34.763
Mm-hmm.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.636

02:38.680 --> 02:40.812

03:03.618 --> 03:06.229
This is very cool. I saw Eli
Russell on the reservation list,

03:06.273 --> 03:07.665
and I thought, "No way."

03:07.709 --> 03:09.406
Always good to meet a fan.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.408
You were
on my fantasy football team.Oh, no kidding?

03:11.452 --> 03:14.019
Your injury ruined my season.

03:14.063 --> 03:16.370
Wasn't great for mine, either.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.200
Did you call ahead and ask him
to make a big fuss over you?

03:20.243 --> 03:22.202
You know me very well.[chuckles]

03:22.245 --> 03:23.725
I'm sorry, Mr. Russell.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.074
I'm having a little trouble
with this card.

03:25.117 --> 03:25.857
Do you happen to have
another one?

03:25.901 --> 03:27.946
Uh, uh, sure.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.949
Here you go.Um, does our room
have a fireplace?

03:30.993 --> 03:32.516
Yes, ma'am.And fluffy robes?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.692
One for each of you.Is it soundproof?

03:34.736 --> 03:36.346
Uh, I don't know.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.435
We'll find out.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.874
I'm so sorry, but this card's
not working, either.ELI: Oh,

03:42.918 --> 03:44.702
you're kidding. You know what?

03:44.746 --> 03:47.227
Check us in, and I'll call
my bank, and we'll work it out.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.837
I can't do that.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.232
Um, here you go, my good man.
[chuckles]

03:52.275 --> 03:53.624
What are you doing?

03:53.668 --> 03:55.452
I'm paying for our room.
And dinner.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.802
And if you're good,
an in-room movie.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.108
Hopefully Top Gun.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.459
Thank you.
And here are your keys.

04:02.503 --> 04:03.982
[chuckles softly]What's happening?

04:04.026 --> 04:05.549
I'll explain everything

04:05.593 --> 04:07.508
once we've properly disturbed
the neighbors.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.599
And I know it seems weird,

04:11.642 --> 04:14.906
but I can't help feeling
what I feel.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.387
I can't imagine my life
without you.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.171
Oh,

04:19.215 --> 04:21.130
God, your breath is flammable.

04:23.524 --> 04:26.309
You lick your balls.
You got to expect it.

04:26.353 --> 04:29.138
[phone rings]

04:31.227 --> 04:33.185
Adriana, hey. What's up?

04:33.229 --> 04:34.839
Guess where I am.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.581
Well, let's see.
You're in Switzerland, so...

04:37.625 --> 04:39.409
Matterhorn? Chocolate factory?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.672
A bank filled with Nazi gold?

04:41.716 --> 04:44.109
I'm in a cab
headed to the airport.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.676
I'm coming to see you.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.678
What? Now?

04:47.722 --> 04:48.940
I'll be there tonight.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.508
[chuckles softly]
Seriously? Um...

04:51.552 --> 04:53.597
Okay. Well,
what about your treatments?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.425
My doctors said
I could take a few days off,

04:55.469 --> 04:59.342
so I thought I'd spend them
tickling your new kidney scar.

04:59.386 --> 05:03.172
Oh, well, uh, yeah.
It's still a little tender,

05:03.215 --> 05:07.350
but, um, maybe you can help me
put ointment on it.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.832
Okay, we're gonna have to work
on your dirty talk.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.314
Hey.Hey. What are you
doing back so soon?

05:14.357 --> 05:16.794
Ugh. Weekend was a bust.ADRIANA: What do you mean?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.361
Sorry. No, I was
talking to Gina.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.710
Say hi for me.

05:19.754 --> 05:20.798
Adriana says hi.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.539
Oh, hi.Gina says hi.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.801
Tell her I miss her.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.629
She misses you.I miss her, too.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.239
She misses you, too.ADRIANA: Oh,

05:27.283 --> 05:28.806
and I loved her last Instagram.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.547
She loved your last Instagram.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.983
My post or my story?Okay,

05:32.027 --> 05:33.333
that's enough. Both of you.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.247
I land

05:35.291 --> 05:36.814
at JFK at 7:00.
Can you pick me up?

05:36.858 --> 05:39.164
She lands at JFK at...
Oh. No, that's for me.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.819
Yes, sure.ADRIANA: Good.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.168
And clean out your back seat.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.822
We're having sex
in the parking lot.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.738
Oh. Ooh. [chuckles]
Well, uh,

05:47.782 --> 05:50.915
just FYI,
it is covered in dog hair,

05:50.959 --> 05:53.004
but, uh, yeah, okay.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.179
See you later, lover boy.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.790
And I will see you...

05:56.704 --> 05:58.706
...world traveling girl.

06:00.316 --> 06:01.665
Adriana's coming?

06:01.709 --> 06:03.580
Yeah. Tonight.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.930
Oh, I'm happy for you.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.541
Well, it-it's been a while.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.281
A lot's happened since then,
so we'll see.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.022
[chuckles softly][exhales]

06:11.066 --> 06:15.287
So, what happened with
your romantic weekend getaway?

06:15.331 --> 06:18.508
[exhales]
Uh, I told Eli about the money,

06:18.552 --> 06:21.772
and he did not take it well.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.383
Oh, no.Yeah.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.688
Every time I tried to pay
for something,

06:24.732 --> 06:26.516
it was like a dark cloud
came over him,

06:26.560 --> 06:28.605
and he would just sulk.Mm.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.520
I hate that.
My ex-wife was a sulker.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.392
How can someone sulk at Epcot?

06:32.435 --> 06:33.784
And on our honeymoon.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.133
Huh!

06:35.177 --> 06:37.048
He barely spoke to me

06:37.092 --> 06:39.747
the whole drive back except
for when we had to stop for gas

06:39.790 --> 06:41.531
and he needed my credit card.

06:41.575 --> 06:44.142
Poor guy. Literally.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.970
Yeah, I don't know

06:46.014 --> 06:47.929
what's gonna happen to us.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.758
I'm sorry.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.456
Look, I want you
to know something.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.980
Your money
does not bother me at all.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.461
Thanks.I'm serious.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.595
You want to be my sugar mama,
I am a diabetic, baby.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.644
Well, that was worth
flying nine hours

07:07.688 --> 07:10.473
next to a screaming baby.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.649
I've been saving myself for you.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.173
You mean in every way?In every way.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.523
Since you called yesterday.Oh!

07:17.872 --> 07:21.179
Hey, um, I'm really glad
you're here.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.443
Well, I would hope so.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.010
So,

07:26.054 --> 07:28.578
what are the doctors
telling you? How's it going?

07:28.622 --> 07:30.493
So far, I seem
to be responding.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.017
If my numbers stay
where they are,

07:33.061 --> 07:35.193
they think I can come home for
good in a couple of months.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.586
Wow, that's amazing.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.153
Then we can pick up
where we left off.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.766
Again, amazing.Oh,

07:42.810 --> 07:44.507
I talked to Gina. We're
having drinks tomorrow

07:44.551 --> 07:46.683
with her and Eli in the city.What? Why?

07:46.727 --> 07:49.033
'Cause they're our friends
and it sounds like fun.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.166
Yeah, no, totally. Fun.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.473
I-It's just that, um, well,

07:53.516 --> 07:55.475
you're only here
for a short time.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.780
Maybe it should just be us?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.695
No, it'll be great.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.175
Gina thinks a night out

08:00.218 --> 08:02.133
might help her and Eli
get back on track.

08:02.177 --> 08:05.093
[chuckles]: Well,
that is goal number one for me.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.052
[indistinct chatter]

08:08.096 --> 08:10.054
Mmm. I never understood

08:10.098 --> 08:11.969
all the salt
on a margarita glass.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.493
It's like I'm drinking
a pretzel.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.409
[chuckles]Do you need to pee?

08:17.453 --> 08:19.542
What kind of question is that?

08:19.586 --> 08:23.067
I'm just curious how my kidney
is handling the tequila.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.547
It's doing just fine.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.724
Shoot me a text if
things go sideways.

08:27.768 --> 08:31.162
I want to make a toast.
To Drew and Gina.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.164
Oh. Sounds like we're a couple.
[giggles]

08:33.208 --> 08:36.167
[clears throat]
Weird.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.517
You guys
got through the surgery,

08:37.560 --> 08:39.344
and now you're both
better than ever.

08:39.388 --> 08:42.086
Aw. Ooh, and I want to
make a toast to Adriana.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.566
Mm.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.568
I am so glad to see
how well you're doing,

08:45.612 --> 08:47.527
and you make Drew

08:47.570 --> 08:49.093
happier than I've
ever seen him.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.182
Well, I don't know
if that's exact...

08:51.226 --> 08:53.750
Yeah. Yes. Cheers.
Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.[chuckles]

08:53.794 --> 08:55.926
And I want to make a toast
to my lady Gina

08:55.970 --> 08:57.711
for looking so fine tonight.

08:57.754 --> 09:01.671
Aw.
[grunting rhythmically]Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.368
You do look great, G.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.761
What about me?

09:04.805 --> 09:06.676
Oh, you look great, too.
Better.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.723
Well, not better. Exactly
the same. [chuckles]

09:09.766 --> 09:11.725
[exhales]
Maybe I do need to pee.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.119
Doesn't matter whose
body that kidney's in.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.860
It does not hold tequila.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.514
[all laugh][phone chimes]

09:21.517 --> 09:22.866
Son of a bitch.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.955
What's wrong?It's my next-door neighbor.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.391
My car is getting towed.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.697
What?Oh, no.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.612
Yeah, it sucks.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.875
Why is it getting towed?
Parking tickets?ELI: I don't know.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.877
I'll figure it out.Well, let's call the
cops and tell them

09:33.921 --> 09:36.793
they're making a mistake.It's fine.
We don't have to call anybody.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.882
But they are towing your car.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.188
It's getting repossessed, okay?

09:41.015 --> 09:42.799
Oh.I'm sorry.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.062
False alarm.
What's going on?

09:45.106 --> 09:47.064
Eli's car got towed.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.327
I got behind on payments.
I thought they were gonna

09:49.371 --> 09:51.634
work with me.You should have told me.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.723
It's not your problem.Yeah, but I could
have given you...

09:53.767 --> 09:55.116
You could have given me what?

09:55.943 --> 09:57.988
I'm sorry.
I can't do this right now.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.642
I got to go.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.166
[exhales]
Wait, I'm coming with you.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.690
I'm so sorry, you guys.

10:04.691 --> 10:05.996
Slow down!

10:06.040 --> 10:08.303
I'm wearing
very expensive heels!

10:10.653 --> 10:11.828
Wow.

10:11.872 --> 10:14.004
Yeah. Poor Gina.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.659
Poor Gina?
Eli's car got repossessed

10:16.703 --> 10:18.922
and she inherited
millions of dollars.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.229
Yeah. Mo' money,
mo' problems.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.146
Uh-oh. Tequila's
making its move.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.633
Oh, God, that
feels so good.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.112
Thank you.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.114
Hey, have you been going to PT
for your hip?

10:37.158 --> 10:38.638
You bet.

10:38.681 --> 10:39.682
Norma.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.510
Just keep rubbing.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.296
So, what's going
on with your Eli?

10:45.340 --> 10:47.777
[sighs] I'm not sure
he's gonna be my Eli

10:47.821 --> 10:49.213
for long.Why?

10:49.257 --> 10:50.911
What's wrong? Lower.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.478
You'd think
me getting all this money

10:53.522 --> 10:55.219
would be a good thing for us.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.308
I'll tell you
what the real problem is.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.396
Oh, please do.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.137
You should maybe
write this down.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.792
Tell me.Men are stupid.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.576
I'm serious.

11:04.620 --> 11:05.969
Money makes them crazy.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.710
When they don't have it
they're miserable

11:07.754 --> 11:10.017
and when they do have it,
they're cocky sons of bitches.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.497
So what do I do?Well,

11:12.541 --> 11:14.064
he's a proud man.
You got to let him

11:14.108 --> 11:16.327
crawl out of this hole himself.Yeah.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.721
But my instinct is to help him.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.984
Yeah, well, that's wrong.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.508
[knock on door]It's open.

11:23.552 --> 11:26.163
Norma, I need a favor.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.078
You still work here?Yeah.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.254
Why?I love this place.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.256
Why?

11:32.300 --> 11:33.605
What do you need, Althea?

11:33.649 --> 11:35.738
Did you steal
Mr. Patel's Cialis?

11:35.782 --> 11:36.913
NORMA:
No.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.436
I'm keeping it till he pays me

11:38.480 --> 11:40.612
what he owes me from gin rummy.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.179
What's he owe you?

11:42.223 --> 11:44.747
$6.25.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.575
Please give me the Cialis.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.446
He's crying.NORMA: Sorry.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.753
I need some kind
of collateral.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.625
He has a date tonight.
How about one?

11:53.669 --> 11:56.585
How about $6.25?

11:57.586 --> 12:00.284
I hate this job.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.634
[door closes]Isn't Mr. Patel

12:02.678 --> 12:04.201
struggling with his memory?

12:04.245 --> 12:06.900
He shouldn't play cards.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.382
Come here.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.080
Oh.

12:14.995 --> 12:19.129
I'm so glad
Gina gave you a horny kidney.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.870
[chuckling]Well, I don't think
that's connected

12:20.914 --> 12:23.220
to that part of the plumbing.
Well, I guess tech...

12:23.264 --> 12:25.396
[chuckling]Mm-hmm.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.963
This is my last night.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.966
I expect you to send me back
with a smile on my face.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.446
[chuckles]:Well,

12:31.489 --> 12:33.970
I will certainly give
it my best effort.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.580
But just, uh,

12:35.624 --> 12:36.930
fair warning, that, uh,

12:36.973 --> 12:38.670
bread pudding is sitting
in here like a rock.

12:38.714 --> 12:39.976
[exhales]
Okay,

12:40.020 --> 12:41.935
you really got to work
on your dirty talk.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.980
[chuckles]

12:44.024 --> 12:47.331
Sorry for dumping
all my problems on you.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.333
Oh. Buddy.

12:49.377 --> 12:52.075
We need to teach you
how to gargle.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.294
[door opens]

12:54.295 --> 12:55.644
Hey.Hey.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.993
Hi.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.516
Eli here?GINA: No.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.345
We're taking a little break
from each other.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.433
Or...

13:02.477 --> 13:05.785
he's taking a break from me.

13:05.828 --> 13:09.353
Oh, no, that sucks.[Gina sighs]

13:09.397 --> 13:10.441
GINA:Yeah.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.313
Uh, you want to talk about it?

13:12.356 --> 13:13.705
Like, in the morning, maybe?

13:13.749 --> 13:15.272
Oh, I'm good.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.926
You guys have fun.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.493
You sure?

13:18.536 --> 13:20.103
GINA:Yeah.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.801
Good night.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.763
Drew?

13:28.764 --> 13:29.939
Oh, yes, of course.

13:29.983 --> 13:33.247
Right away. Sexy time.
[chuckles]

13:37.338 --> 13:39.296
All right, what's
going on here?

13:39.340 --> 13:40.558
What do you mean?Oh,

13:40.602 --> 13:42.560
come on. You and Gina.What?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.736
You think I'm an idiot?
You're obviously into her.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.565
No.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.045
Oh, my God.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.830
Okay, yeah. I mean...

13:50.873 --> 13:53.397
[chuckles]
I care about her.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.356
But, like, you know,
how you care about a friend

13:55.399 --> 13:56.574
who gave you a kidney.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.576
Oh, I knew this would happen.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.230
You're not sick anymore,
but I still am.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.710
You're ready to move on.
It's perfect.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.190
You and her
already have matching scars.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.974
No, it'’s not that at all.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.584
I'm just a little confused,

14:06.628 --> 14:08.673
okay? Ever since the
surgery, I've just been

14:08.717 --> 14:10.371
questioning everything.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.069
I'm sorry, but I need some time
to sort things out.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.245
Time?
You're asking your girlfriend,

14:15.289 --> 14:17.073
the cancer patient, for time?

14:17.117 --> 14:18.988
[scoffs]

14:19.032 --> 14:21.251
What are you doing?I'm leaving.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.949
So you can sort things out.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.301
[door opens]

14:28.302 --> 14:30.521
Hey.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.522
Hey.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.784
Where's Adriana?

14:32.828 --> 14:33.916
She left.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.526
Is everything okay?

14:35.570 --> 14:37.093
No.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.399
What happened?

14:40.053 --> 14:41.358
Uh, hard to say.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.794
Jet lag. Cancer.

14:42.838 --> 14:45.058
Early onset menopause.
Anybody's guess.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.538
What about you guys?

14:47.582 --> 14:49.062
Money.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.891
He doesn't have any and
I'm farting Bitcoins.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.503
Where'd you guys leave it?

14:56.504 --> 14:58.898
[sighs]
I'm not sure.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.422
But if you had to guess?

15:03.685 --> 15:05.774
We're just gonna
have to see.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.910
Gina.

15:13.086 --> 15:16.654
There are times like this
that make you realize

15:16.698 --> 15:19.831
how important certain people are
in your life.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.225
Boy, is that true.

15:22.269 --> 15:25.446
You see where I'm headed?Yeah.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.405
With everything going on
in my life,

15:28.449 --> 15:30.712
I am so lucky to have you
as a friend.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.803
You're reading my mail.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.241
I thought this money
was gonna make me happy,

15:38.285 --> 15:39.939
but... you know what?

15:39.982 --> 15:42.332
The happiest that
I've ever been

15:42.376 --> 15:44.160
is when I gave
you a kidney.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.335
Really?Yeah.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.946
Gave my life purpose.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.513
It gave my life life.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.951
Look at us.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.954
Two people whose
dreams have come true,

15:54.997 --> 15:56.520
and we're miserable.[chuckles]

15:56.564 --> 15:59.306
Happier lives
have been built on less.

16:00.916 --> 16:04.746
I'm nodding, but I don't
know what that means.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.445
Okay, people.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.794
Just got off a conference call

16:09.838 --> 16:11.274
with corporate,
and it looks like

16:11.318 --> 16:13.885
we're in for another
round of budget cuts.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.496
[staff groans]Again?

16:15.539 --> 16:17.672
Are we trying to give these
people a nice place to live

16:17.715 --> 16:18.890
or just make a buck?

16:18.934 --> 16:21.154
[chuckles]
You're adorable.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.026
No more free van service.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.549
If the residents
want to go somewhere,

16:25.593 --> 16:27.116
they're gonna
have to take an Uber.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.336
But most of the residents
can't work the Uber app.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.729
Yeah, half of them
have flip phones.

16:31.773 --> 16:34.558
Yeah.
Well, it sucks to get old.

16:34.602 --> 16:37.474
All right.
Meal choices will be reduced.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.825
We're gonna make cuts to the
theater, arts and music program.

16:40.869 --> 16:44.133
And, also, we'll be losing
half of the overnight staff.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.570
[scoffs]What are we supposed
to tell the residents?

16:46.614 --> 16:48.137
LUDLUM:
Good question.

16:48.181 --> 16:51.749
How about we wait and see
if anybody notices.

16:51.793 --> 16:52.837
Okay,

16:52.881 --> 16:54.404
big smiles, everyone!

16:54.448 --> 16:57.755
Now, go out there
and act like you care.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.583
We do.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.543
Very convincing.

17:04.632 --> 17:07.374
I know what to do
with my money.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.163
[knock on door]Drew?

17:14.207 --> 17:15.251
DREW: Bathroom!Oh.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.426
I need your help.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.515
Again, bathroom.

17:18.559 --> 17:21.083
I don't mind.What?

17:21.127 --> 17:25.044
I'm going to buy
the retirement home I work at.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.436
What?Yeah.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.395
Um, there's probably
gonna be some paperwork,

17:28.438 --> 17:30.571
so I'll need your help
with that.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.139
[toilet flushes]

17:34.140 --> 17:35.576
What?
