13:03.282 --> 13:04.825
DON'T WORRY.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.493
I ACED IT IN PRACTICE.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.703
WE'LL BE FINE.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.805
- GO, FABIAN.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.890
OVER THE OTHER.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.183
- OKAY, NOW GO, GO.
UNDER THE RED.

13:29.266 --> 13:29.934
CAREFUL!
WATCH FOR YOUR HEAD.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.685
WATCH, WATCH--OKAY, OKAY.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.436
WATCH OUT FOR THE SILVER,
RIGHT SHOULDER.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.772
RIGHT SHOULDER.
GOOD.

13:34.855 --> 13:35.731
- OKAY, YELLOW ONE.
YELLOW ONE.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.234
YOUR LEG, OVER IT.
OVER IT, ALFIE.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.401
SILVER ONE, ALFIE.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.111
ALFIE, YOUR HEAD'S GOT
THE SILVER ONE,

13:41.195 --> 13:42.321
ABOVE YOU, ABOVE YOU.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.240
- WATCH OUT!
WATCH OUT FOR THE YELLOW.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.282
YOU DID IT.
OKAY.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.410
GOOD JOB.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.330
- SO...
WHAT ABOUT THE HOOKS?

13:51.413 --> 13:53.707
- YEAH, THERE'S
A SILVER ONE HERE.

13:53.791 --> 13:58.921
- YELLOW HERE,
AND A RED ONE THERE.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.257
- WHAT ABOUT
THE GIGANTIC SPIDER?

14:03.592 --> 14:05.344
- IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO GO ANYWHERE.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.931
- SO THAT MUST MEAN
THEY PUT SOMETHING IN IT.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.349
- PATRICIA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:10.432 --> 14:11.225
- THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE TUNNEL.
MUST HIDE.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.143
- WHO IS IT?

14:13.227 --> 14:14.436
- SHE CAN'T SEE, REMEMBER?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.271
HERE, OVER HERE.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.438
- THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.941
- OKAY, GUYS, FORGET
THAT WHOLE THING I SAID

14:19.024 --> 14:20.109
ABOUT GOING SLOWLY.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.653
JUST GET BACK HERE
AS QUICK AS YOU CAN.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.114
- FOOT OVER, OVER, CAREFUL.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.156
OKAY, BACK DOWN.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.658
- WATCH OUT FOR THE SILVER.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.451
- HURRY UP, GUYS!

14:36.542 --> 14:37.585
- OH...

14:37.668 --> 14:40.504
NOW, THAT IS NEW.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.950
NOW, WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.051
ALL FUN AND GAMES, EH, ROBERT?

15:29.386 --> 15:30.512
[screams]

15:30.596 --> 15:33.223
[groaning]

16:04.755 --> 16:08.801
- FABIAN, WILL YOU GET
YOUR ELBOW OUT OF MY FACE?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.315
- OKAY, WHO WAS THAT?

16:23.399 --> 16:24.608
- I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T SEE, REMEMBER?

16:24.692 --> 16:27.027
- THIS IS REALLY BAD.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.613
BADDER THAN BAD.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.407
- COME ON.
LET'S JUST GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.574
- OKAY.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.033
WATCH OUT.
BE CAREFUL.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.246
- AH-HA-HA-HA-HA!

16:37.329 --> 16:39.832
OH...

16:39.915 --> 16:41.625
- I GOT THESE
FROM THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.626
THINK ANY OF THEM MIGHT HELP?

16:42.710 --> 16:44.002
- MOST DEFINITELY.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.129
- HONESTLY, JEROME,

16:45.212 --> 16:46.588
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT HYGIENE.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.798
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT--

16:47.881 --> 16:48.716
- I KNOW, MARA.
IT'S OKAY; DON'T WORRY.

16:48.799 --> 16:49.758
- HAVE YOU GOT A PLAN?

16:49.842 --> 16:50.926
- ALWAYS.

16:51.009 --> 16:52.636
- JEROME!

16:52.720 --> 16:56.890
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'LL NOTICE
IF YOU SMASH THE SINK TO BITS?

16:56.974 --> 16:59.226
- GOOD POINT.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.144
HMM...

17:02.020 --> 17:03.230
- BETTER.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.781
- JASPER...
- MM-HMM?

17:13.866 --> 17:16.535
- WHY DID YOU WANT ME
WORKING HERE?

17:16.617 --> 17:20.289
- BECAUSE YOU WERE THE RIGHT
PERSON FOR THE JOB, OF COURSE.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.624
WHY?

17:22.708 --> 17:25.919
- IT'S JUST...

17:26.002 --> 17:28.338
WELL, YOU AND VERA SEEM
TO HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.341
- TRUDY, ARE YOU
A LITTLE JEALOUS OF VERA?

17:31.425 --> 17:35.554
I CAN UNDERSTAND.
IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.972
TO BE FRANK,

17:37.055 --> 17:38.223
VERA JUST DOESN'T HAVE
YOUR AMBITION.

17:38.307 --> 17:42.144
YOU ARE FAR, FAR MORE USEFUL
OVER HERE WITH ME.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.229
AND THAT'S WHY I SPECIFICALLY
WANTED YOU HERE.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.451
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

17:57.534 --> 17:59.161
- I HAVE SEEN IT ON TV.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.913
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

18:03.081 --> 18:04.374
OH, OH, OH!

18:04.458 --> 18:05.459
- YOU'VE SEEN IT ON TV,
HAVE YOU?

18:05.542 --> 18:07.669
- YEAH.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.005
<i>WORLD'S WORST</i>
<i>PLUMBING DISASTERS.</i>

18:10.088 --> 18:12.007
- OH!
I'M SO SORRY.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.383
JEROME, MARA.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.261
WHAT ARE YOU BOTH DOING IN HERE?

18:16.345 --> 18:19.765
AND WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN
VICTOR'S TOOLS?

18:21.809 --> 18:24.269
TELL ME.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.564
- YOU'D BETTER COME CLEAN,
JEROME.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.817
- OKAY.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.735
I LOST SOMETHING
DOWN THE DRAIN.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.695
- IT WAS MY FAULT, VERA.

18:33.779 --> 18:38.492
- WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE COME
TO ME FIRST, OKAY?

18:38.575 --> 18:40.410
I'LL HELP YOU GET IT.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.287
I'M SURE YOU'VE BOTH
GOT THINGS TO DO.

18:42.371 --> 18:46.959
- ACTUALLY, JEROME, I WAS MEANT
TO GO AND SEE MR. SWEET.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.711
- OH, YEP, YEP.
THAT'S RIGHT, BAIL.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.421
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH,
MARA GETS GOING.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.340
- SORRY.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.969
- HEY.
- HOW'S PATRICIA?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.804
- SHE'S OKAY.
JUST RESTING.

18:58.887 --> 19:02.224
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.560
- WELL, WE NEED
TO FIND THREE THINGS

19:04.643 --> 19:05.936
TO HANG ON THE HOOKS

19:06.019 --> 19:08.355
AND SOME SORT OF LARGE SPIDER
TO PUT IN THE HOLE.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.108
- COME ON, SARAH,
THROW US A BONE HERE.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.317
- I'M MORE WORRIED

19:12.401 --> 19:13.861
ABOUT WHO CHASED PATRICIA
DOWN THE TUNNEL.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.404
- DID SHE NOT HEAR ANYTHING?

19:15.487 --> 19:17.155
NO VOICE?

19:17.239 --> 19:17.698
DEEP BREATHING?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.741
ANY CLUE AT ALL?

19:19.825 --> 19:22.119
- NOTHING.
JUST FOOTSTEPS.

19:22.202 --> 19:22.911
- SOMEONE WITH FEET.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.747
WELL, THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.543
- WELL, IT MUST HAVE
BEEN VICTOR, RIGHT?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.753
- AH!

19:31.837 --> 19:32.421
FABIAN!

19:32.504 --> 19:34.006
OH!

19:34.089 --> 19:36.425
YOU SCARED THE LIFE OUT OF ME.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.551
- HEY, BUDDY, WHAT'S UP?

19:37.634 --> 19:39.386
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE, JEROME?

19:42.139 --> 19:46.435
- JUST WAITING TO USE
THE GIRLS' BATHROOM.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.397
- RATHER THAN THE BOYS' ONE
DOWNSTAIRS?

19:50.480 --> 19:53.692
- I AM SO BORED AT THAT ONE,
AREN'T YOU?

19:53.775 --> 19:55.277
I JUST FANCIED
A CHANGE OF SCENERY.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.278
- HUH.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.905
- I GET THAT.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.323
I GET THAT.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.660
- SUSPICIOUS MUCH?

20:03.744 --> 20:06.330
- YOU DON'T THINK IT COULD
HAVE BEEN JEROME DOWN THERE,

20:06.413 --> 20:07.289
DO YOU?

20:07.372 --> 20:08.582
- I'M NOT SURE.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.250
BUT I AM SURE
THAT HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.506
- I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU,
MR. SWEET.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.966
- OH, IT'S FINE.
FINE, MARA.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.010
GAVE ME AN EXCUSE
TO WRAP UP THE STAFF MEETING.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.262
THEY DO TEND
TO DRAG ON A BIT.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.473
AND YOU SAID THIS WAS
FOR A PIECE

20:24.556 --> 20:25.641
YOU'RE WORKING ON.

20:25.724 --> 20:29.269
IS IT A FOLLOW-UP
TO THE JUNK FOOD EXPOSE?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.938
- I HAD TO SHELF THAT ONE.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.230
- OH.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.274
- APPARENTLY, IT MADE
TWO OF THE LUNCH LADIES CRY,

20:34.358 --> 20:37.194
AND NOW THE REST
WON'T SPEAK TO ME.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.153
- OH, DEAR.

20:38.236 --> 20:39.947
- NO, THIS IS A NEW ONE,
BUT...

20:40.030 --> 20:42.908
IT'S A BIT SECRET.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.660
- HOW INTRIGUING.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.536
- WELL, IF I CAN HELP
IN ANY WAY.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.205
- WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING,

20:48.288 --> 20:49.831
WHEN TRUDY LEFT HER JOB
AT ANUBIS HOUSE

20:49.915 --> 20:52.918
TO GO AND WORK FOR JASPER,

20:53.001 --> 20:54.544
HOW DID VERA
COME TO GET HER JOB?

20:54.628 --> 20:57.714
- VERA?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.675
SHE APPLIED.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.052
- I SEE.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.679
WERE THERE MANY APPLICANTS?

21:03.762 --> 21:05.722
- OH, NO, JUST THE ONE.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.849
- BUT YOU ADVERTISED.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.269
AND SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON
THAT APPLIED?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.271
ISN'T THAT A BIT UNUSUAL?

21:13.355 --> 21:15.273
- WELL, I--I SUPPOSE...

21:15.357 --> 21:17.025
WELL, IT REALLY
WASN'T A PROBLEM.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.360
- WHY IS THAT?

21:18.443 --> 21:21.238
- BECAUSE JASPER GAVE HER
A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION,

21:21.321 --> 21:24.199
AND AFTER THAT, WELL,
I COULD HARDLY SAY NO.

21:24.282 --> 21:27.786
- NEXT STOP: JASPER CHOUDHARY.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.211
- HOW'S IT GOING, VERA?

21:36.294 --> 21:37.546
- ALMOST THERE.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.590
AND I THOUGHT I ASKED YOU
TO PACE OUTSIDE.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.259
IT'S VERY DISTRACTING.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.176
pop!

21:43.260 --> 21:43.969
- NO--WAY TO GO, VERA!

21:44.052 --> 21:46.054
YOU'VE GOT IT.

21:46.138 --> 21:46.763
I NEVER DOUBTED YOU
FOR A SECOND.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.224
HAVE YOU GOT IT?

21:55.105 --> 21:56.982
- I'M SORRY, JEROME.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.401
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.486
- NO WAY.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.571
WHERE IS IT?

22:03.864 --> 22:05.240
NO, NO, IT CAN'T BE GONE.

22:05.323 --> 22:05.449
ARE YOU SURE?

22:06.992 --> 22:12.122
- HOW VERY COLLECTABLE.
