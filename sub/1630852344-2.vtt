00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:22.022 --> 00:23.982


00:24.065 --> 00:26.151
Pulling up security footage now.

00:26.234 --> 00:29.112
We should be able to spot
whoever broke into the vault.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.489
I can't wait
to get my hands on these fools!

00:31.573 --> 00:33.033
Really? And do what with them?

00:33.616 --> 00:35.577
Whatever it takes.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.329
I like
the cut of this guy's jib.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.040
He's not usually like this.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.459
He got hit with
one of those jelly grenades.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.879
It's supposed to make him afraid
of everything, but since he already is…

00:45.962 --> 00:49.132
-It's kinda like subtracting a negative.
-Ooh!

00:49.215 --> 00:52.343
I can't believe someone
went through all this trouble

00:52.427 --> 00:54.304
just to ruin Incineration Day!

00:54.387 --> 00:57.932
Not to mention they'll probably use
those weapons for some crazy, evil plan!

00:58.933 --> 01:02.062
Right… Of course.
I am equally mad about that.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.440
Not to point fingers,
but we wouldn't be having this problem

01:05.523 --> 01:08.359
if you three didn't think
it was a good idea

01:08.443 --> 01:11.529
to keep a pile of dangerous tech
just lying around.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.240
Yeah, Commander White!

01:14.324 --> 01:18.119
Yeah, okay, well that tech was secure!
We had so many fail-safes in there.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.038
I got locked in the bathroom last month,

01:20.121 --> 01:22.624
and it took the bomb squad
a week to get me out.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.918
It was great until, like,
my phone battery died.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.920
Hashtag, alone on the throne.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.129
Whoever pulled this off

01:28.213 --> 01:31.090
managed to get in and out
without getting seen by the cameras.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.176
It's almost like
a ghost robbed this place.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.054
I wish! Then we might actually
have a chance of catching them.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.807
I could pull the ectoplasm
emission readers out of storage,

01:38.890 --> 01:41.851
boot up the ol' corporeal replicator,
and then voilà, we have a--

01:44.687 --> 01:47.440
Actually, I think I…
said a little too much there.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.652
It's not a ghost.
It's clearly an inside job.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.029
Someone knew how to
get around the security system.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.031
-Hang on…

01:55.115 --> 01:57.075
I got something! There!

01:59.869 --> 02:03.873
Well that rules out vampires, but it's
fair to say ghosts are still on the table.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.793
Uh, I think it's just a regular man.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.587
It's always a regular man.
Never a ghost.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.426
General Dudley!

02:15.510 --> 02:17.470
The guy whose base we broke into?

02:17.554 --> 02:19.514
Where we got the key car
and rescued Layla?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.683
The way I remember it, I rescued y'all.

02:21.766 --> 02:26.146
How is Dudley still active duty?
His base is broken into every other day!

02:26.229 --> 02:30.608
I don't know, and I don't care.
Our target's acquired. Let's roll out!

02:31.442 --> 02:33.361
And where exactly are we rolling?

02:33.444 --> 02:36.030
Those trucks we were following
literally disappeared,

02:36.114 --> 02:37.907
and they're masked from our satellites.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.826
We don't know where they're going.

02:39.909 --> 02:44.289
Ooh, I'll tell you where they're going:
to a world of pain!

02:44.372 --> 02:48.585
Ugh! When does that fear bomb wear off?
Okay? I want my old Cisco back.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.753
Wait a second, that's it!

02:51.504 --> 02:54.215
Fear bombs emit
a particular type of radiation.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.342
If we can't track the vehicles…

02:56.426 --> 02:57.844
We can track the weapons.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.638
There he is!
Moving north through the Alps.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.056
Nice work, Frostee.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.518
Looks like we've got our location.
Now can I say it?

03:05.602 --> 03:06.769
Go ahead.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.563
Let's roll out!

03:17.405 --> 03:21.034
We're locked on to the convoy,
but I'm not sure where it's headed.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.869
This area looks pretty deserted.

03:22.952 --> 03:26.456
According to his personnel file, Dudley
has a cabin at the top of the mountain

03:26.539 --> 03:28.458
where he stays when he goes fly fishing.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.335
He also enjoys ice sculpting.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.504
Aw, that's nice.
Even bad guys need hobbies.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.050
Sounds more like he needs a life.
Keep your eyes peeled, everyone.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.552
Dudley is
a highly-trained military officer

03:39.636 --> 03:42.680
and a few raisins shy
of a decent trail mix.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.183
We don't know
what defense measures he has in place.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.893
<i>I have a few ideas!</i>

03:50.313 --> 03:54.484
Uh, I think the fear goo has finally
worn off, because I am terrified!

04:01.324 --> 04:03.910
I see Dudley! Closing in on him now!

04:15.213 --> 04:18.591
Oh, man! They're trying to
make a sandwich out of Tony!

04:18.675 --> 04:21.094
A BLT? Bacon Lettuce Toretto?

04:21.177 --> 04:24.013
I was gonna say Tony Melt.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.557
-Oh, I could go for a Reuben right now.
-Guys!

04:26.641 --> 04:27.809
A little help here!

04:27.892 --> 04:29.644
-My bad!
-Sorry.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.062
Cisco, your rocket!

04:42.824 --> 04:44.993
Guys, we lost visual.
Anyone see General Dudley?

04:45.576 --> 04:46.452
I got eyes on him.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.582
We gotta get down there.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.308
Not bad.

05:13.896 --> 05:14.856
Back at ya.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.156
Layla and I are right on Dudley's tail.
It looks like he's headed into some cave.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.283
That must be his escape route.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.910
You need to stop him
before he makes it in there.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.748
Uh-oh. Our satellites are picking up some
meteorological glitch in the troposphere.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.459
My eyes are picking up
a giant blizzard right behind us!

05:37.378 --> 05:40.340
-Team, we've got incoming.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.509
-Toretto, Echo, does anyone copy?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.344
The storm took out our communications.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.770
Yo, what's with the winter wonderland?

05:58.316 --> 06:00.234
Hey! Keep your eyes on the road!

06:05.656 --> 06:06.574
Whoa!

06:06.657 --> 06:08.910
Tony's about to go off the side!

06:08.993 --> 06:10.119
Whoa!

06:10.203 --> 06:11.079
I got you, T!

06:15.083 --> 06:16.793
You're safe now, buddy!

06:16.876 --> 06:18.836
Phew. Thanks, Cisco.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.470
This storm is crazy!

06:27.553 --> 06:31.057
I know, but Dudley's not slowing down.
We gotta stay on him!

06:51.994 --> 06:53.871
-These winds are too strong!

06:53.955 --> 06:56.999
We're losing altitude!
I'm gonna try to put her down gently!

06:59.669 --> 07:01.003
-Or not!

07:04.215 --> 07:06.634
We have to bail. Now!

07:18.646 --> 07:20.314
Echo? Nowhere?

07:20.398 --> 07:21.732
Anyone copy?

07:22.233 --> 07:24.318
Ugh! I'm getting nothing on the radio.

07:24.402 --> 07:28.239
So we're stuck out here without our cars
or a way to contact the rest of the crew?

07:28.322 --> 07:30.324
-Or sweaters!

07:30.408 --> 07:32.410
What? You know how dangerous it is

07:32.493 --> 07:34.745
to have exposed skin
in these frigid temperatures?

07:34.829 --> 07:37.248
We could get frostbite, or hypothermia…

07:37.331 --> 07:40.960
And that's if we don't get eaten
by a giant yeti first!

07:41.043 --> 07:42.962
You know they like
their food freeze-dried.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.547
Cisco has a point.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.758
Not about the yetis, obviously,
but we need to find shelter.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.970
If those guys we were chasing find us,
we're sitting ducks out here.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.723
-Yeah. You're right.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.640
Uh, there!

07:54.724 --> 07:56.350
That must be Dudley's cabin.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.353
We can wait out the storm
and find something to pull our cars up.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.772
And re-establish
communications with the team.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.983
Yeah, and find some sweaters!

08:04.066 --> 08:06.944
Or maybe like a homemade quilt
or something like that, you know?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.196
Maybe a pillow that says,

08:08.279 --> 08:11.574
"The early bird can have the stupid worm,
I'm sleepy!", you know?

08:11.657 --> 08:14.827
Or one shaped like a road sign
that says, "Snuggle Bunny Crossing."

08:14.911 --> 08:15.953
Aw!

08:16.037 --> 08:17.997
Something that warms
the body and the soul.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.582
Let's move.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.963
Well, we made it in.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.007
Now what?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.387
No, it's nothing.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.599
Hey, did you ever hear PizzaRave
talking about those mole people?

08:36.682 --> 08:39.018
I'm pretty sure
that's not who we're chasing.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.603
Maybe they're chasing us.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.649
Would you rather fight
a mole the size of a person,

08:44.732 --> 08:46.359
or 50 people the size of a mole?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.195
I'd rather find a way out of here.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.614
-50 tiny mole people for me, hands down.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.616
You can kick 'em,
stomp 'em, fricassee 'em…

08:53.699 --> 08:55.535
Zip it, hayseed. What was that?

08:59.330 --> 09:00.915
We got you, Dudley.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.208
Uh, Echo?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.964
How do we know which is the real Dudley?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.383
Okay. That's new.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.467
Ghost suits, huh?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.844
Well, I see your ghost suits,
and raise you…

09:15.012 --> 09:16.180
a laser grenade.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.767
What are you doing?
If you use that, our suits won't work!

09:19.850 --> 09:22.019
And neither will theirs. Ha!

09:22.728 --> 09:25.189
Now let's stomp these fools,
Gum Neck style!

09:28.734 --> 09:30.069
Is everyone alright?

09:30.152 --> 09:31.779
Find your buddy.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.657
Found him! What happened back there?

09:34.740 --> 09:38.703
It's like we lost the element of surprise
and got surprised by the elements!

09:38.786 --> 09:41.330
There was a miniature version
of Cleve's weather machine

09:41.414 --> 09:44.625
in the batch of stolen tech
that could have caused this storm.

09:44.709 --> 09:49.463
It was built with an internal ionizer so
it's able to operate without satellites.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.425
That actually sounds helpful.
Why were we going to blow it up?

09:52.508 --> 09:54.093
It was too unpredictable.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.762
Try to program
a light afternoon sprinkle

09:56.846 --> 09:58.848
and you wind up with a fire typhoon!

09:59.765 --> 10:01.934
Oh. Okay, that is bad.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.687
Gary, where did
the weather anomaly originate?

10:04.770 --> 10:07.440
Before we lost our connection,
the signal pinged here,

10:07.523 --> 10:09.191
on the north side of the mountain.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.737
Then that's where we're headed.
We need to shut that machine down.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.656
The new and improved,
extremely dangerous machine!

10:15.740 --> 10:16.741
We get it, Gary!

10:20.161 --> 10:22.663
Are we there yet?

10:22.747 --> 10:26.834
Yes, Cisco. The cabin
is literally right in front of us.

10:26.917 --> 10:27.752
Huh?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.004
For real? Oh, sorry.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.299
It's not my fault.
I think I'm starting to get snow madness!

10:33.382 --> 10:36.594
They say the first symptom is
believing you have snow madness!

10:36.677 --> 10:39.972
Okay. Be careful, guys. Dudley has been
three steps ahead of us all day.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.974
His place could be
loaded with booby traps,

10:42.058 --> 10:45.186
or there could be an army of drones
inside, ready to take us out.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.067
I think we're clear.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.072
-Huh?
-What the--?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.366
Snow madness!

10:58.949 --> 11:03.204
If Dudley's been here the whole time,
who were Echo and Layla chasing?

11:11.045 --> 11:12.296
You're trapped.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.091
You have no idea
how to get out of this cave.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.843
No, but you do.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.233
Now get us out of here.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.443
Whew!

11:34.527 --> 11:38.447
Can't believe I'm saying this, but
I've never been happier to see you kids.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.784
Almost had to
turn this chair into a toilet.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.411
Wouldn't be the first time.

11:43.994 --> 11:44.995
Take it from me,

11:45.079 --> 11:48.332
when an enemy interrogator
offers you "complimentary" coffee,

11:48.916 --> 11:50.376
do not drink it.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.837
You will definitely pay for it later.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.255
I don't get it.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.631
I wet my pants, son.

11:55.714 --> 11:59.510
Ah, no, not that!
Why would your own men tie you up?

11:59.593 --> 12:01.887
Did they turn on you
after you stole those weapons?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.681
Those aren't my men out there.

12:03.764 --> 12:08.144
Whoever took those weapons set me up.
Forged documents, doctored footage…

12:08.227 --> 12:12.690
Did a darn good job from the looks of it.
Good enough to trick Nowhere.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.777
Eh, we're not buying it, Dudley.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.865
Yeah. That story
sounds awfully "convenient."

12:20.948 --> 12:23.701
Well, not too long ago,

12:23.784 --> 12:26.537
a certain bunch of annoying,
pain-in-the-neck kids

12:26.620 --> 12:29.123
were singing the same song
back in Mexico City.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.500
Hey! If you're talking about us,

12:31.584 --> 12:35.087
we're a bunch of annoying,
pain-in-the-neck young adults.

12:35.171 --> 12:39.800
Look, I'm a military man.
I follow a strict chain of command.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.888
The whole "covert missions, going rogue,
harboring dangerous tech" thing

12:43.971 --> 12:45.306
is your way of operating.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.141
If I were laying odds,

12:47.224 --> 12:51.937
I'd say the mastermind behind this
is closer to you than you think.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.361
Which way out of the mountain?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.113
While we're walking,

13:01.197 --> 13:04.283
you can tell us everything you know
about what Dudley's planning.

13:04.366 --> 13:08.496
Dudley? I don't work for Dudley.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.748
Yeah? Then who do you work for?

13:10.831 --> 13:15.252
I'll tell you who I work for,
if you tell me who you work for.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.587
That's classified.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.340
-Even from you.
-What's that supposed to mean?

13:19.423 --> 13:21.884
It means you're
a couple of expendable pawns

13:21.967 --> 13:24.053
working for an agency
no one's ever heard of,

13:24.136 --> 13:25.679
led by someone you've never met.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.808
Who's to say that Ms. Nowhere having
the weapons is any better than Dudley?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.977
Or Moray? Or Sudarikov?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.897
Nowhere's not using weapons
to destroy the world.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.816
No, she's using them
to control the world.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.861
And isn't control
just another form of destruction?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.738
The destruction of free will!

13:43.322 --> 13:45.741
Ugh, this is like Shashi all over again.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.451
He had some good ideas.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.955
He just wasn't prepared for
everything your little team could do.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.542
Okay, who are you?
How do you know all this?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.378
Seems like
Ms. Nowhere should be able to tell you.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.714
So either she doesn't know,
or she's keeping you in the dark.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.299
Either way, I'd be worried.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.010
I've dealt with plenty of
crazies and would-be bosses,

14:05.094 --> 14:07.596
and let me tell you,
Ms. Nowhere knows what she's doing.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.600
Including getting punks like you to talk.
So move!

14:12.184 --> 14:14.436
I'm sure
you have a lot of questions,

14:14.520 --> 14:18.691
but unfortunately, it looks like you won't
have the chance to get those answers.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.156
Great. We barely got away last time.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.617
How are we supposed to
fight off more of these guys?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.744
With a little help from Palindrome.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.747
-Jump!

14:38.252 --> 14:40.004
You stole that from him, didn't you?

14:40.087 --> 14:42.381
I borrowed it! Wink!

14:49.388 --> 14:50.890
We need to get to higher ground.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.607
-These guys just don't quit!
-At least we put some distance between us.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.780
Well, that's not good.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.618
This seems like the eye of the storm.
We must be close.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.579
There's the weather machine,
twelve o'clock high!

15:14.413 --> 15:17.458
I'm going to use this EMP
to shut it down!

15:30.930 --> 15:31.847
That's not good.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.018
-This is not good.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.354
Ugh! It's too bitter!

15:38.437 --> 15:39.688
Are you kidding me?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.607
Those are hand-picked cacao beans,

15:41.690 --> 15:45.319
directly imported from a private
Colombian farm that you're drinking.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.863
Meh. Needs marshmallows.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.742
-I know. Kids, right?

15:51.825 --> 15:55.871
Mm… Okay. My turn.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.792
Ooh! This is a good one!

16:02.169 --> 16:03.420
Sounds like…

16:06.590 --> 16:09.009
I, uh…

16:09.093 --> 16:10.094
Oh, flapjacks!

16:10.803 --> 16:11.971
Pancakes!

16:12.054 --> 16:13.639
Bam! You got it, dawg!

16:15.474 --> 16:17.935
-How do you get those so fast?

16:18.018 --> 16:21.355
Oh, well, anytime Cisco says,
"Oh, this is a good one," it's about food.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.858
Man, I hope the rest of the team
is having this much fun.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.157
This is useless.
We're never gonna outrun them.

17:13.991 --> 17:14.992
I've got a plan.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.872
-Get ready to jump.
-I'm ready, but what about your suit?

17:22.666 --> 17:24.585
Don't worry. I've got my own way down.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.232
We're going to have to
shut this thing down manually!

18:28.315 --> 18:31.193
It's time for the ol' bait and switch.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.737
You two be the bait,
and I'll flip the switch.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.824
Just once, it would be nice
if she volunteered to be the bait.

18:36.907 --> 18:41.537
Hey! Less talking,
more walking… in front of those lasers!

19:18.031 --> 19:18.991
Hi-ya!

19:39.094 --> 19:41.763
Well, look at this. The sun came out.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.557
Nowhere? Tony?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.475
Anybody there? Hello?

19:45.559 --> 19:46.435
<i>Echo!</i>

19:46.518 --> 19:47.936
Are you okay?

19:48.020 --> 19:48.854
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:48.937 --> 19:52.399
<i>Layla and I are fine, but we're all</i>
<i>the way back at the base of the mountain.</i>

19:52.482 --> 19:53.442
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:55.235
-We're--
-<i>Hey, Echo!</i>

19:55.777 --> 19:58.030
<i>Frostee, Cisco and I</i>
<i>made it up to Dudley's cabin.</i>

19:58.113 --> 19:59.823
<i>He's actually here with us right now.</i>

19:59.907 --> 20:01.033
Wait, you're with--

20:01.116 --> 20:05.412
<i>Are you sure?</i>
<i>We've been seeing double Dudley all day.</i>

20:05.495 --> 20:06.496
<i>Hang on.</i>

20:06.580 --> 20:08.582
-<i>Ow!</i>
-<i>Yup! It's him.</i>

20:10.417 --> 20:14.963
Let me get this straight. While the five
of us were out there risking our lives,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.591
you three sat by the fireplace

20:17.674 --> 20:22.054
and enjoyed warm, chocolatey beverages
with the enemy?!

20:22.137 --> 20:24.514
Well, I wouldn't say I enjoyed 'em.

20:24.598 --> 20:28.101
Ms. Nowhere, General Dudley is innocent.
He was tied up here the whole time.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.811
A likely story.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.648
Those guys we were fighting
were just able to look like him.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.815
Oh please!

20:33.899 --> 20:37.861
Don't tell me you are all falling for
the Chameleon Gambit?

20:37.945 --> 20:40.030
Have I taught you nothing?

20:40.113 --> 20:43.242
Shouldn't we be focused on
the ghost Layla and I captured?

20:43.325 --> 20:46.245
She knew details about the agency
and our past missions.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.038
Highly classified stuff.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.081
Exactly!

20:49.164 --> 20:52.501
Someone wanted us to believe Dudley
was the one who stole those weapons.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.836
I think we're being sent
on a wild goose chase.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.214
Aw man, I hate wild geese!

20:57.297 --> 20:58.674
They're always so angry,

20:58.757 --> 21:02.261
and they travel in gaggles,
which sounds fun, but it is not.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.762
Could the agency have a mole?

21:03.845 --> 21:08.684
Possibly. But let us worry about that.
You all stay focused on the task at hand.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.770
-Saving Incineration Day!
-Yes!

21:11.853 --> 21:12.688
No!

21:13.230 --> 21:18.110
Well… Yes, but in order to do that,
we need to track down those weapons.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.822
And we start by interrogating

21:21.905 --> 21:25.909
the man who engineered
this whole operation from the beginning.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.121
The mastermind. The kingpin! The--

21:33.083 --> 21:34.793
This is Nowhere. Uh-huh.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.213
Mm-hm. Mm! Mm-hm.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.549
-Copy that.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.344
So…

21:44.886 --> 21:47.139
I don't think
Dudley was behind the attack.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.016
-Huh?
-You gotta be kidding.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.726
The agency just got an alert

21:50.809 --> 21:53.520
that high-tech weapons
matching the ones stolen from us

21:53.603 --> 21:57.107
are being used by a wanted criminal
to cause havoc on the Autobahn.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.400
Hey, that's great!

21:59.026 --> 22:01.903
Not the causing havoc part,
but that's a solid lead.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.071
Did they say who it is?

22:04.281 --> 22:07.326
-It's Rafaela.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.036
Rafaela in Germany?

22:09.578 --> 22:10.829
<i>Ach du lieber!</i>

22:36.354 --> 22:39.107
