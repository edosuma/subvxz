00:07.023 --> 00:08.354
<i>Previously on</i> ER...

00:08.591 --> 00:10.024
Tell me what's going on.

00:10.326 --> 00:11.486
- What happened?
- My God!

00:11.728 --> 00:12.922
Where do I find a C-collar?

00:13.663 --> 00:15.130
A garage-door opener.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.392
Go ahead and try it.

00:17.634 --> 00:20.228
- You carry a gun?
- Under the front seat of my car.

00:20.503 --> 00:23.666
So what is all this about?
This little dance you did today.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.374
If I can find a way to do
what my patient wants...

00:26.643 --> 00:28.668
...then I think that's
what I should do.

00:28.978 --> 00:31.674
I shouldn't cut somebody open
just because I can.

02:07.010 --> 02:10.877
- It's still raining, I see.
- It's Bangladesh out there, Jerry.

02:12.115 --> 02:14.515
- How are you?
- You go for a swim?

02:14.751 --> 02:16.218
Something like that.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.213
- You're in early.
- I couldn't sleep.

02:19.455 --> 02:22.720
The couple next door at the motel
were working on a record.

02:23.026 --> 02:25.927
- Motel?
- I haven't had time to find a place.

02:26.196 --> 02:28.494
I heard the West Side's nice.
Not too pricey.

02:28.731 --> 02:32.098
- Internships still at poverty wage?
- Twenty-seven grand.

02:32.368 --> 02:35.496
But second year, it jumps
all the way to 30 grand.

02:35.772 --> 02:37.103
Twenty-eight.

02:37.540 --> 02:41.135
Carol grew up on the West Side.
She can tell you where to look.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.241
- Thanks.
- Okay.

02:42.512 --> 02:43.308
<i>Dr. Benton?</i>

02:47.283 --> 02:49.183
- What time is it?
- It's 5.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.451
How long since you've been home?

02:52.021 --> 02:53.648
Has Tabash been down yet?

02:53.923 --> 02:57.222
He rounds at 7. Why don't you
go home and take a shower?

02:57.493 --> 02:59.620
I scrub in in 30 minutes.
Do me a favor.

02:59.863 --> 03:02.297
If there are any changes,
page me, okay?

03:38.534 --> 03:40.001
What are you doing?

03:41.838 --> 03:43.703
Watching you sleep.

03:46.042 --> 03:47.441
For how long?

03:49.212 --> 03:50.406
I don't know.

03:55.018 --> 03:56.485
It's raining.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.615
You're beautiful.

04:10.099 --> 04:13.660
Good morning, doctor.
Early bird catches the worm, huh?

04:13.937 --> 04:17.668
I was waiting for Mrs. Ginsburg.
I was hoping to talk with you today.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.805
Marla doesn't get in until 7.

04:20.642 --> 04:22.508
What's on your mind, doctor?

04:23.146 --> 04:26.047
Now? I was hoping for
an appointment this afternoon.

04:26.316 --> 04:28.284
There's no time like the present.

04:29.652 --> 04:32.450
I'd prefer to come back later,
if that's okay with you.

04:32.989 --> 04:36.516
Are you intentionally trying
to irritate me, Dr. Carter?

04:36.759 --> 04:38.021
No, sir.

04:39.028 --> 04:39.892
Then speak up.

04:49.906 --> 04:52.704
I've been contemplating leaving
the Surgical Program.

04:53.209 --> 04:57.168
I've been considering it for quite
some time, and I feel...

04:57.680 --> 05:01.514
...that I've made an error
in selecting surgery as my specialty.

05:03.586 --> 05:06.487
For the most part,
the training has been excellent...

05:07.090 --> 05:09.115
...but I just feel...

05:10.393 --> 05:11.587
...that ultimately...

05:12.462 --> 05:13.929
...I don't belong in surgery.

05:14.197 --> 05:17.394
And I would suspect that you
would agree with me.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.624
I certainly do not!

05:20.770 --> 05:21.668
You don't?

05:23.639 --> 05:28.269
You entered into a contract, doctor.
A contract with this institution.

05:28.544 --> 05:31.536
We agreed to give you
the finest surgical training...

05:31.814 --> 05:35.011
...in exchange for six years
of your best effort.

05:35.284 --> 05:36.876
I understand, but I think...

05:37.186 --> 05:39.086
I do not give a damn what you think!

05:39.355 --> 05:41.323
This is not summer camp.

05:41.724 --> 05:43.817
You cannot just run home to mommy.

05:44.227 --> 05:47.719
You're going to suck it up
and stick to it! That's what men do.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.464
Are we communicating here?

05:49.732 --> 05:50.562
- Yeah.
- Good!

05:50.800 --> 05:54.201
And if I ever hear this crap
coming out of your mouth again...

05:54.504 --> 05:56.267
...the only medicine
you'll be practicing...

05:56.539 --> 06:00.373
...is picking out a cough suppressant
for yourself down at the Jewel!

07:08.744 --> 07:11.440
Hey, Dr. Greene,
Dr. Weaver's looking for you.

07:18.955 --> 07:20.820
Dr. Greene, you okay?

07:22.658 --> 07:24.057
I'm fine, Jerry. Thanks.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.554
West Town's great.

07:25.795 --> 07:30.061
A lot's been bought up by lawyers and
bankers. You can still find a place.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.335
- How much do you want to spend?
- Six hundred, tops.

07:33.569 --> 07:37.562
Have you ever thought of finding
a roommate? You'll get more space.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.606
I'm living by myself. Four years
undergrad, four med, three Pedes.

07:41.911 --> 07:45.779
- Shared a bathroom the entire time.
- I grew up with two sisters, one sink.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.379
Seven brothers.

07:47.617 --> 07:48.641
Seven?

07:49.485 --> 07:53.353
- Where are you in the lineup?
- Oldest. I wrap a mean diaper. You?

07:53.656 --> 07:56.124
Youngest. Wow, eight kids!

07:56.425 --> 07:59.690
- Was your dad independently wealthy?
- Mailman.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.255
So, Mrs. Martinez, Chuck has
some pain in his right hip?

08:03.533 --> 08:07.367
Yes. He's been home from school
all week. He's getting over a cold.

08:07.803 --> 08:12.172
Okay, Chuckie-boy, let's take
a look at this, okay?

08:13.242 --> 08:14.334
You like sports?

08:16.646 --> 08:20.412
You slide into home trying to beat
the throw from center field?

08:20.683 --> 08:21.911
His temp's 99.8.

08:25.288 --> 08:28.189
Did you fall off your skateboard?
Anything that might've hurt your hip?

08:28.558 --> 08:30.116
I don't have a skateboard anymore.

08:30.660 --> 08:33.561
He wouldn't wear his wrist pads,
so I took it away.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.659
Your mom's right about that.

08:36.566 --> 08:37.464
Licorice?

08:39.135 --> 08:43.037
Has he had any kind
of penetrating wound or injury?

08:43.339 --> 08:46.706
Been in the woods camping,
nature hikes at school, anything?

08:48.010 --> 08:52.879
CBC with a diff, Chem-7,
sed rate, ultrasound, blood cultures.

08:53.149 --> 08:56.676
- And let's get an arthrocentesis.
- I'm gonna have to call down Ortho.

08:58.688 --> 09:01.816
I don't think it's any big deal.
We just gotta make sure.

09:04.527 --> 09:06.825
I talked to Dr. Weaver.
Did she tell you about it?

09:07.129 --> 09:08.187
Talked about what?

09:08.464 --> 09:10.261
I'm hoping to leave
my Surgical Residency.

09:10.533 --> 09:11.397
You're what?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.693
I'd like to be considered
for Emergency Medicine.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.438
- What did Anspaugh say?
- He was less than enthusiastic.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.867
Doyle has a chest pain in Curtain 2.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.472
You've missed this year's match.

09:20.743 --> 09:22.142
I was hoping for a spot
outside the match.

09:22.411 --> 09:24.379
And that you'd put in
a good word with Anspaugh.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.444
Was Dr. Weaver supportive?

09:26.749 --> 09:28.944
Weaver has a better relationship
with Anspaugh.

09:29.252 --> 09:31.618
She could probably be more persuasive.

09:34.423 --> 09:35.890
- Thanks.
- Tell me how it goes.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.622
Sure.

09:38.361 --> 09:41.819
Retract the liver inferiorly,
and rotate it medially.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.397
Peter?

09:44.767 --> 09:46.792
- The coronary ligament.
- Right.

09:48.337 --> 09:52.000
Mobilize the right lobe,
exposing the vena cava.

09:52.275 --> 09:54.106
- You all right?
- A vascular clamp.

09:56.479 --> 09:57.309
Yours?

09:57.580 --> 10:00.208
Shirley, can you check that page
on the table, please?

10:01.083 --> 10:02.948
I'll suture. You retract.

10:03.219 --> 10:04.243
Six-two-three-seven.

10:06.389 --> 10:07.447
Problem, Peter?

10:09.292 --> 10:12.728
Dr. Hicks, look...
I'm sorry, but I've gotta go.

10:12.995 --> 10:14.257
What?

10:14.530 --> 10:15.428
I'm sorry.

10:15.965 --> 10:20.493
Shirley, call Dr. Pitard to assist.
I think he's in Recovery.

10:21.904 --> 10:25.237
Thirty-nine-year-old male
experienced the onset of chest pain.

10:25.508 --> 10:28.136
Mr. Munder has a family history
of coronary disease.

10:28.411 --> 10:29.901
My dad died at 36.

10:30.179 --> 10:32.579
Vitals are normal,
BP's 100/50, pulse is 48.

10:32.848 --> 10:35.840
- Pulse ox, 99.
- So you were at the gym, Mr. Munder?

10:36.152 --> 10:38.848
Yeah, weight circuit. I was on
the bench press when it started.

10:39.121 --> 10:41.487
- What happened when you stopped?
- It went away.

10:41.857 --> 10:43.347
- Do you smoke?
- Hell, no!

10:43.626 --> 10:46.356
- His BP and pulse are low.
- Yeah, but he's an athlete.

10:46.629 --> 10:49.894
Am I having a heart attack?
It's probably just muscle strain.

10:50.166 --> 10:53.363
But with your family history,
we're not taking any risks.

10:53.636 --> 10:56.901
Hep-Lock, CBC, Chem-7,
cardiac enzymes...

10:57.173 --> 10:58.902
...portable chest
and an EKG.

10:59.175 --> 11:02.440
Don't forget the low-tech approach.
Give him an aspirin.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.205
Your husband looks a little thin,
Mrs. Curwane. Has he been eating?

11:08.484 --> 11:10.918
Whatever he wants, I give to him.

11:11.220 --> 11:14.451
Abdomen's distended.
See if there's a surgeon around.

11:14.690 --> 11:16.453
No guarding or rebound.

11:16.726 --> 11:19.058
No palpable organomegaly.

11:19.795 --> 11:23.959
- I can't find a vein.
- Was your husband on any medications?

11:26.902 --> 11:29.928
CBC, lytes, LATS...

11:30.206 --> 11:32.231
...amylase and an abdominal series.

11:32.508 --> 11:35.944
Tenormin, hydrochlorothiazide,
Altace, Thorazine...

11:36.212 --> 11:40.478
Burt. Burt, honey.
You be strong now. You be strong.

11:40.983 --> 11:42.507
Mommy's here.

11:43.686 --> 11:45.347
Mommy's here.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.111
Hey, Carol.

11:47.390 --> 11:49.950
Somebody may call.
I put you as a character reference.

11:50.226 --> 11:52.717
- You're kidding, right?
- It's this Big Brother thing.

11:52.995 --> 11:54.724
- The thing with the kids?
- One kid.

11:54.997 --> 11:58.057
- You don't see enough here?
- A couple hours a week.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.665
Good for you, Doug.

12:01.103 --> 12:04.561
What are you doing tonight?
You wanna get some oysters at Shaw's?

12:04.840 --> 12:06.865
Sorry. I have a date.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.439
Oh, yeah?
Who's the lucky guy?

12:09.712 --> 12:11.304
Toby Minz up in Hemo/Onc.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.639
Yeah, Toby. Good.
He's a great guy.

12:13.949 --> 12:15.439
A little lacking
in the hair department.

12:15.684 --> 12:18.244
Except for his arms.
You ever seen his arms?

12:18.654 --> 12:22.750
Ortho called. They'll be an hour
before they can do the arthrocentesis.

12:23.058 --> 12:23.922
Thanks.

12:24.226 --> 12:25.318
Arthrocentesis?

12:25.561 --> 12:27.461
Eight-year-old kid with hip pain.

12:27.763 --> 12:30.197
Del Amico's worried it might be
septic arthritis.

12:30.466 --> 12:33.435
A lot of tests for a kid getting
over an upper-respiratory infection.

12:33.702 --> 12:35.067
She was being overly cautious.

12:35.337 --> 12:39.501
Hold everything except for the CBC
and diff, and I'll check him out.

12:41.377 --> 12:42.605
Toby Minz?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.650
You get any sleep last night?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.287
On and off.

12:59.295 --> 13:00.853
He's off the oscillating vent.

13:01.130 --> 13:03.928
The nitric oxide worked, so we
moved him onto the respirator.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.030
And?

13:05.301 --> 13:08.099
The ultrasound showed no hemorrhage
or dilatation of ventricles.

13:08.370 --> 13:12.466
And the CT revealed no evidence
of periventricular leukomalacia.

13:12.741 --> 13:15.301
- What's he saying?
- The structures of the brain are okay.

13:17.646 --> 13:18.442
Thank God.

13:18.714 --> 13:22.377
So there'll be no developmental
problems or disabilities, right?

13:22.751 --> 13:26.448
Well, there can be problems
associated with anoxia.

13:27.323 --> 13:28.221
What's anoxia?

13:28.457 --> 13:30.357
Your baby was deprived of oxygen
in the womb.

13:30.626 --> 13:34.426
So there's always the possibility
that there could be brain damage.

13:37.166 --> 13:40.533
Will he be able to play with
other kids and learn to read?

13:40.769 --> 13:42.930
If you're asking will he be
a doctor or a lawyer...

13:43.606 --> 13:46.006
...I can't say.
Chances are, your baby will be fine.

13:46.809 --> 13:48.902
But a certain percentage do have...

13:49.178 --> 13:52.147
...neuro-developmental problems
and/or learning disabilities.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.540
What percentage?

13:53.816 --> 13:56.785
Infants delivered at 32 weeks
with no complications...

13:57.086 --> 13:59.884
...have a better than 98 percent
chance of being normal.

14:02.858 --> 14:04.951
What about the ones
with complications?

14:05.494 --> 14:08.190
Your child had several serious...

14:08.464 --> 14:10.591
...complications at birth.

14:10.833 --> 14:13.802
No one can give you
an accurate percentage.

14:14.069 --> 14:15.730
It's not an exact science.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.368
Babies are resilient.

14:18.741 --> 14:20.936
We'll just have to wait and see.

14:29.919 --> 14:32.012
- You're buying a gun?
- I'll feel safer.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.483
- What are you getting?
- SIG Sauer.9 mm.

14:34.723 --> 14:37.453
The guy at the shop tried
to sell me a Colt.45.

14:37.726 --> 14:39.921
A lot of weapon for a beginner.
Stick to the SIG.

14:40.229 --> 14:42.129
I'm gonna check on her chest pain.

14:43.265 --> 14:44.163
How's the hand?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.526
Itches like hell.

14:45.768 --> 14:49.431
- You weren't gonna let anybody sign it.
- Rachel's Brownie troop.

14:49.738 --> 14:53.469
A detective from CPD called
and said he'd come by with pictures.

14:53.742 --> 14:56.643
- I thought this circus was over.
- Maybe they caught somebody.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.241
Hey, how's Rachel doing?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.471
Jennifer's back, so Rachel's with her.

15:00.749 --> 15:04.310
Listen, Doug, could you write me
a scrip for some Percodan?

15:04.587 --> 15:06.953
- Ribs still sore?
- The pain keeps me up at night.

15:07.256 --> 15:09.520
- When do you see that hand guy again?
- Monday.

15:10.192 --> 15:12.456
I could write you for five or six,
tide you over.

15:12.695 --> 15:14.595
Mark, we need you over here.

15:14.863 --> 15:16.922
I could use a few more than that.

15:19.068 --> 15:21.764
ST elevation in 2, 3, and A-VF.

15:22.037 --> 15:24.938
Malik, one over 150,
nitro sublingually.

15:25.541 --> 15:27.372
Is he having a heart attack?

15:28.377 --> 15:30.140
- It really hurts!
- How's his BP?

15:30.412 --> 15:31.902
BP's 125 over 80.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.412
All right, 5 mgs morphine.
IV push every 15.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.481
Start a nitroglycerine drip.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.985
Is he having a heart attack?

15:40.255 --> 15:42.052
- Mrs. Munder.
- I'm afraid so.

15:42.324 --> 15:45.316
- Oh, God! I knew it.
- Heart rate's down to 45.

15:45.561 --> 15:48.257
- Looks like a block.
- Second-degree Mobitz type II.

15:48.564 --> 15:50.794
Atropine, .5 mgs.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.092
- Don't let me die!
- I'm hearing rales.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.769
Lasix, 40 mgs, IV push.
He's going into failure.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.064
Let's set up for a
transcutaneous pacemaker.

16:01.644 --> 16:02.440
What's up?

16:02.711 --> 16:06.203
Ninety-two-year-old man.
History of vomiting and dehydration.

16:06.482 --> 16:09.280
He's agitated, abdomen's distended.
No bowel sounds.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.712
Could be a small bowel obstruction.
Meds?

16:12.021 --> 16:15.422
Hydrochlorothiazide, Thorazine,
Altace and Tenormin.

16:15.658 --> 16:16.556
Kerry.

16:18.527 --> 16:21.155
- It's bedsores.
- Sacral area too.

16:22.031 --> 16:25.933
- He's coming in from a nursing home?
- His wife's been taking care of him.

16:27.102 --> 16:29.297
Not very well.
Abdominal series back yet?

16:29.571 --> 16:30.469
Any minute.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.173
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

16:35.944 --> 16:39.436
- I talked to Dr. Anspaugh.
- Is he gonna let you out?

16:39.682 --> 16:41.479
A few words from you would help.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.742
You're still interested in pursuing
Emergency Medicine?

16:45.054 --> 16:48.080
Yeah. I asked Dr. Greene about it.
He seemed supportive...

16:48.357 --> 16:50.917
...but he thought it might be
difficult to find a spot.

16:51.193 --> 16:53.889
I've got an LOL in 6.
Weak and dizzy all over.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.425
I'll be right there.

16:55.664 --> 16:58.394
Dr. Greene's probably right
about finding a slot.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.626
We only have so much salary
budgeted for next year.

17:02.905 --> 17:04.805
That's okay.
You don't have to pay me.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.965
You don't need a salary?

17:08.210 --> 17:09.268
No, I'm fine.

17:09.712 --> 17:12.476
So you'll put in a good word
with Dr. Anspaugh?

17:12.748 --> 17:14.146
- Sure.
- Thanks.

17:18.987 --> 17:20.818
Did the kid with the hip get moved?

17:21.089 --> 17:22.853
I don't know. Check the desk.

17:26.395 --> 17:30.422
Carol, do you know where Chuck
Martinez and his mom got moved to?

17:31.033 --> 17:34.093
Doug Ross released him.
He didn't talk to you about it?

17:34.369 --> 17:37.031
No. Do you have any idea
where he is?

17:37.306 --> 17:38.671
I think he's in the lounge.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.865
I said, "Put your head down."

17:42.144 --> 17:44.942
So he looks me in the eye,
and he pukes. Everywhere.

17:45.214 --> 17:46.738
On the floor, on my shirt...

17:47.049 --> 17:50.780
You had no right to release my patient
without consulting me first.

17:51.053 --> 17:54.181
- What are we talking about?
- My 8-year-old with the sore hip.

17:54.423 --> 17:56.914
You ordered $4000 worth of tests
for a child with...

17:57.392 --> 18:01.123
- He was my patient!
- I game him Advil. I supervise you.

18:01.396 --> 18:04.297
- It could have been septic arthritis.
- I looked at the CBC.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.466
- It was synovitis.
- What if it's early-stage?

18:06.702 --> 18:10.695
You want to put an 8-year-old boy
through a painful procedure...

18:11.006 --> 18:12.906
...on the remote possibility
he's suffering...

18:13.208 --> 18:15.836
...from a rare diagnosis
your tests don't even indicate.

18:16.111 --> 18:20.172
You can gamble with your patients'
lives, but don't do it with mine.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.248
- He's in heart block!
- Pulse ox?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.750
- Eighty-eight.
- Is he dying? He's dying.

18:27.055 --> 18:29.819
- We need you to stand over here.
- It's not capturing.

18:30.092 --> 18:33.084
Get the transvenous pacemaker
and the fluoroscope now.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.454
- What's open?
- Trauma One.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.129
All right. Let's go!

18:36.632 --> 18:38.600
You want me to call Cardiology?

18:38.801 --> 18:41.269
If they want the procedure,
they'd better run.

18:41.770 --> 18:44.330
Abdominal series doesn't
show obstruction.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.164
So it's not surgical.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.373
Probably an ileus.

18:48.644 --> 18:53.081
- Crit's 51. Potassium's 2.1.
- Let's get some potassium going.

18:53.348 --> 18:56.681
Put 40 milli-equivalents in a liter
of saline, run it over two hours.

18:56.985 --> 18:59.613
What about the bedsores,
malnutrition, dehydration?

18:59.855 --> 19:01.686
Does she have any help at home?

19:02.791 --> 19:05.658
She doesn't look like she can
take care of herself.

19:08.530 --> 19:09.758
Mrs. Curwane...

19:11.700 --> 19:14.601
...your husband's not going
to require surgery.

19:15.170 --> 19:16.501
He has an ileus.

19:16.772 --> 19:19.673
A section of his intestinal tract
is paralyzed...

19:19.975 --> 19:21.442
...and that's making him sick.

19:22.110 --> 19:23.077
Paralyzed?

19:23.345 --> 19:26.075
It could have been caused
by one of his medications.

19:26.348 --> 19:27.576
So...

19:28.083 --> 19:29.710
...we're gonna work on that.

19:30.552 --> 19:32.543
Does your husband get enough to eat?

19:33.455 --> 19:36.049
I cook for him every day.

19:36.491 --> 19:37.617
All his favorites.

19:38.293 --> 19:40.193
We're sure you do,
but does he eat it?

19:41.730 --> 19:43.129
He's fine.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.225
We're just getting older, that's all.

19:47.302 --> 19:50.897
We're also concerned that he might not
be getting enough exercise.

19:51.173 --> 19:54.700
Does he have a walker so he can
get out of bed and move around?

19:55.010 --> 19:56.409
He's been sick.

19:57.045 --> 20:00.242
When he's feeling better,
he's out in the yard all day...

20:00.482 --> 20:02.211
...with his roses...

20:02.517 --> 20:03.984
...his vegetables.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.346
We had the most lovely beets
and beans last season.

20:07.589 --> 20:09.614
Just lovely.

20:12.060 --> 20:13.288
Mrs. Curwane...

20:14.663 --> 20:15.755
...I think...

20:17.065 --> 20:20.933
...maybe it's time to consider placing
your husband in a nursing home...

20:21.236 --> 20:23.500
...or a rehabilitation facility.

20:24.907 --> 20:27.000
I take good care of him.

20:28.243 --> 20:32.009
You've done a wonderful job, but now
he needs more than you can give.

20:32.681 --> 20:36.412
We've lived in our house
for 48 years.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.820
Burt loves that house.

20:42.858 --> 20:44.826
You just fix him up...

20:46.695 --> 20:48.492
...and I'll take him home.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.967
That's where he belongs.

20:53.902 --> 20:56.063
Found her at Grant Park,
face down in the mud.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.362
Fourteen, maybe 15.

20:57.639 --> 21:00.039
BP's 90 over 50. Pulse 56.
Temp's 101.

21:00.309 --> 21:02.937
Skin's clammy, cool, slightly dusky.
Two IVs going.

21:03.211 --> 21:04.872
Glucose 120 and two of Narcan.

21:05.147 --> 21:07.411
- Vomited on herself, track marks.
- Any I.D.?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.810
No way I stick my hands
into these pockets!

21:10.118 --> 21:13.110
- What do we got open?
- They're clearing Trauma 2.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.220
Lot of kids squat by
the baseball fields.

21:15.490 --> 21:17.219
Carol, better take a look.

21:17.492 --> 21:19.221
Oh, damn it! Lilly, get Dr. Ross!

21:19.528 --> 21:21.723
- Trauma 2, tell him.
- I can handle it.

21:21.997 --> 21:23.862
Coming through!
Get out of the way!

21:24.099 --> 21:28.365
O-2, 10 liters by mask. Two more mgs
Narcan, IV. Prep for gastric lavage.

21:28.637 --> 21:31.162
I've run hundreds of ODs.
I don't need Ross.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.501
I didn't call him to babysit. She's
his patient. Her name is Charlie.

21:38.113 --> 21:39.671
Sorry to keep you waiting.

21:40.983 --> 21:44.578
We picked up a guy at Mercy.
Mugged a doctor in the parking lot.

21:44.820 --> 21:47.311
- We thought it might be your guy.
- I don't remember much.

21:47.589 --> 21:49.955
Just look them over,
and tell us what you can.

21:50.258 --> 21:51.247
He was black?

21:52.127 --> 21:54.561
Just tell us if you recognize
any of these men.

21:57.933 --> 21:59.025
Take your time.

22:07.843 --> 22:08.935
I don't know.

22:11.980 --> 22:13.311
I think maybe this guy.

22:16.118 --> 22:17.813
I've seen him before.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.382
He could've been a patient
or something.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.119
- Thanks for your help.
- Is that the right guy?

22:25.394 --> 22:28.295
You know, I remember the pants.
I saw the pants.

22:28.597 --> 22:32.294
- Dark blue, and the shoes were black.
- Yeah. We got that in the report.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.831
You know, that might be the right guy.

22:35.103 --> 22:37.867
I just didn't see much.
It happened so fast.

22:38.140 --> 22:41.041
Is there a pop machine
around here somewhere?

22:42.144 --> 22:45.238
Yeah, that's across the hall
by the chairs.

22:45.514 --> 22:48.506
- Thanks. You want anything, Ford?
- No, thanks. I'm okay.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.229
This guy knocked you
around pretty good.

23:02.531 --> 23:05.398
I can give you a couple of names.
Some victims' groups.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.535
- People that handle these things.
- I'm fine. Thanks.

23:10.405 --> 23:11.303
Sure.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.058
Son of a bitch!

23:45.440 --> 23:46.304
Damn!

24:03.258 --> 24:04.589
Goddamn it!

24:05.193 --> 24:06.956
She was face down in the mud, OD'd.

24:07.229 --> 24:10.426
She's got track marks, skin pops,
cellulitis. We're lavaging her.

24:10.632 --> 24:13.294
- CBC, Chem-20, tox screen?
- And blood alcohol.

24:13.602 --> 24:15.433
- Foley's in.
- Antibiotics going?

24:15.704 --> 24:16.602
Be my guest.

24:18.273 --> 24:22.471
Ancef, one gram.
Gentamicin, 50 milligrams, IV.

24:23.378 --> 24:24.208
How old?

24:25.147 --> 24:25.977
Fourteen.

24:26.515 --> 24:27.379
Going on 40.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.612
I'll call her mother.

24:31.286 --> 24:32.617
A miracle, huh?

24:35.790 --> 24:37.189
Have you held him yet?

24:38.360 --> 24:39.349
No.

24:40.695 --> 24:41.753
Small...

24:42.364 --> 24:43.592
...but strong.

24:45.767 --> 24:46.893
You name him?

24:47.636 --> 24:51.470
We haven't even talked about it.
We thought it would be bad luck.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.264
I think it's safe now.

24:53.542 --> 24:54.600
I gotta get back.

24:54.910 --> 24:55.899
You coming?

24:56.678 --> 24:58.009
In a bit. In a bit.

25:11.660 --> 25:14.026
- Someone gonna get the phone?
- I got it last time.

25:14.329 --> 25:15.819
- You did not.
- Did too.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.395
- You never answer it.
- I always answer it.

25:18.633 --> 25:19.497
ER.

25:20.068 --> 25:23.094
It's Gerontology.
How's it coming with Mr. Curwane?

25:23.371 --> 25:26.272
I got Social Work coming down.
Waiting for P.T. And Nutrition.

25:26.541 --> 25:29.408
- This is Dr. Carter.
- Yeah, I'm still holding.

25:29.678 --> 25:31.578
I hate talking to these caseworkers.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.215
So Mark busted a chair in the lounge?

25:35.483 --> 25:37.781
Smashed the coffee pot, mugs.
A real mess.

25:38.086 --> 25:39.883
- Where is he?
- He had to run an errand.

25:40.155 --> 25:41.417
I need to talk to you.

25:41.656 --> 25:43.089
Anybody want to help me out?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.692
- What's up?
- I'm looking for somebody.

25:46.027 --> 25:48.018
The ambulance guys brought her here.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.388
Does she have a name?

25:49.864 --> 25:52.389
Yeah, Charlie.
I don't know her last name.

25:52.834 --> 25:54.563
- Who are you?
- A friend.

25:54.836 --> 25:57.703
- A close friend.
- And you don't know her last name?

25:58.406 --> 26:00.135
I'm not that kind of friend.

26:00.642 --> 26:04.134
- You gonna tell me where she is?
- Her mom's coming. Ask her.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.635
Oh, her mom.

26:05.947 --> 26:08.711
She ain't coming.
She's in jail. Possession.

26:09.584 --> 26:11.211
Well, then Charlie goes to DCFS.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.385
Fine, whatever.

26:13.622 --> 26:17.581
Just tell her Tommy stopped by.
I'll be on the corner after 10.

26:17.859 --> 26:19.827
I'll make sure she gets the message.

26:22.297 --> 26:23.787
Charlie's coming around.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.865
Jerry, I'm on the line with DCFS.

26:27.135 --> 26:30.002
Page me in Trauma 2
if they ever pick up.

26:33.608 --> 26:37.442
Gerontology's all backed up.
I'm gonna see if I can grab somebody.

26:37.712 --> 26:38.804
Dr. Weaver?

26:39.447 --> 26:41.312
You should've warned me
about Dr. Anspaugh.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.847
- What happened?
- He wouldn't even discuss it.

26:44.152 --> 26:46.882
I'm sorry. I thought maybe
you could turn him around.

26:47.155 --> 26:49.817
I would love to have you
in Emergency Medicine...

26:50.091 --> 26:53.060
...but whatever your difficulties
with Dr. Anspaugh are...

26:53.328 --> 26:55.159
...you have to solve them yourself.

26:58.833 --> 27:00.664
Tox screen came back.

27:00.969 --> 27:03.437
Positive for cocaine, benzos, opiates.

27:03.705 --> 27:07.072
Blood alcohol's.23.
CBC shows a white count of 15.5.

27:07.342 --> 27:09.537
Hemoglobin's 9.8.
Crit 28.

27:09.811 --> 27:11.278
Elevated AST and bilirubin.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.446
- Hepatitis?
- Restraints?

27:13.748 --> 27:15.807
- I don't want her to bolt.
- Take them off.

27:16.117 --> 27:18.984
- She's still my patient.
- I understand that.

27:19.254 --> 27:21.688
She won't want to talk
if she's wearing restraints.

27:21.956 --> 27:25.414
- Just don't leave her alone...
- You know what? I'll deal with it.

27:27.829 --> 27:28.853
Hey, you.

27:30.165 --> 27:33.032
I saw your bellybutton ring
was infected.

27:33.268 --> 27:35.736
Did you do it yourself
with a rusty nail?

27:37.138 --> 27:38.503
I don't feel so good.

27:38.773 --> 27:40.798
Yeah, well, we pumped your stomach...

27:41.343 --> 27:44.676
...found more chemicals in there
than a toxic-waste dump.

27:44.979 --> 27:46.810
I was just partying with friends.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.346
So you graduated to smack now,
did you?

27:50.985 --> 27:52.077
When can I go home?

27:52.454 --> 27:53.216
Where's that?

27:54.956 --> 27:55.820
With my mom.

27:56.558 --> 27:58.116
We hear your mom's in jail.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.155
- I won't go back to foster care.
- Is that where you were?

28:03.898 --> 28:06.696
The guy was trying to do me,
and his wife was a drunk.

28:06.968 --> 28:07.866
Sounds rough.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.628
- You gonna let me go?
- Where?

28:10.972 --> 28:11.870
I've got friends.

28:12.140 --> 28:15.701
I know. Friends you can share
a dime bag with if you want.

28:16.711 --> 28:17.735
Who's the cheerleader?

28:20.248 --> 28:23.308
That's Dr. Del Amico.
She took care of you when you came in.

28:24.386 --> 28:26.616
Is she the one who ruined my high?

28:28.390 --> 28:29.152
You like her?

28:30.558 --> 28:33.789
I'll call your caseworker,
and we'll get you into rehab...

28:34.095 --> 28:34.993
...get you dried out.

28:35.296 --> 28:38.732
Or you can keep screwing up your life
and end up dead in some alley.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.298
That'll be your choice.

28:43.371 --> 28:44.838
I'm pretty tired.

28:50.278 --> 28:52.178
What are you doing here?

28:52.480 --> 28:54.539
Our job site's on the
other side of Wells.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.512
I wondered what time
you'll be home for dinner.

28:57.786 --> 29:02.120
Jeanie, an MVA pulling up. A guy got
T-boned by a semi on the Kennedy.

29:02.757 --> 29:04.486
Kerry, this is Al Boulet.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.885
We met last year. Hi.

29:07.662 --> 29:09.129
Here they come!

29:09.431 --> 29:10.295
I gotta go.

29:10.532 --> 29:12.397
I'll be home around 8.
You're cooking?

29:12.667 --> 29:14.931
I've got all sorts of surprises
lined up.

29:15.203 --> 29:17.694
- No frozen dinners, please.
- I'll see you at 8.

29:17.972 --> 29:19.132
Home by 8, huh?

29:19.941 --> 29:22.273
I guess we got some catching up to do.

29:24.145 --> 29:25.772
When did you start smoking?

29:26.815 --> 29:28.282
I bummed one from Doyle.

29:29.617 --> 29:33.951
I hear you had a meltdown today.
You picked a fight with the lounge.

29:35.557 --> 29:36.819
Feel better?

29:37.158 --> 29:38.147
Not really.

29:40.361 --> 29:44.491
I'm not writing you that prescription
for the Percodan. You need help.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.529
I'm fine.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.098
Taking a chair to the lounge
isn't fine...

29:48.403 --> 29:51.304
It's never happened to you.
You don't know.

29:54.008 --> 29:56.738
I'll get someone else
to write me the Percodan.

29:58.513 --> 30:01.141
If you ever want to talk,
you know where to find me.

30:03.751 --> 30:04.513
<i>Dr. Carter.</i>

30:05.053 --> 30:05.849
Dr. Anspaugh.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.556
Dr. Weaver just dragged me down here
for a Surgical consult.

30:09.791 --> 30:11.281
You were nowhere to be found.

30:11.559 --> 30:14.084
I came as soon as I was paged.
Want me to take it?

30:14.395 --> 30:17.887
No, thank you, doctor.
I'll see you upstairs for rounds.

30:19.467 --> 30:22.630
You got a bunch of people
waiting on you in Curtain 3.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.998
- Said you called them down...
- Right, right. Thank you.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.611
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Carla Kramer, Social Work.

30:32.914 --> 30:33.972
Daniel Shaw, Dietary.

30:34.215 --> 30:36.115
Ann Ferguson, Physical Therapy.

30:36.684 --> 30:40.484
So you've all had a chance to see
Mr. Curwane, review the chart?

30:41.456 --> 30:43.424
Why don't we take a step outside?

30:49.364 --> 30:50.388
Hey, Peter.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.900
Move over.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.101
- How'd you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

30:58.039 --> 31:00.269
It's what you used to do
when you were little.

31:01.342 --> 31:04.334
Whenever you got in trouble,
you'd go down to the church.

31:04.846 --> 31:08.111
You knew if Daddy found you, he'd
figure you were repentant...

31:08.383 --> 31:10.647
...and wouldn't take the belt to you.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.216
You're saying I was
that calculating as a kid?

31:13.454 --> 31:14.978
Mommy thought so.

31:15.423 --> 31:18.392
Me, I think Daddy was right.

31:18.660 --> 31:22.926
You were harder on yourself than
any of us could have ever been.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.830
Carla said she hasn't seen you
since this morning.

31:32.507 --> 31:34.668
I didn't know it was
gonna be this hard.

31:35.777 --> 31:36.539
What?

31:37.045 --> 31:39.775
The baby may have brain damage...

31:40.648 --> 31:44.448
...developmental problems, autism,
retardation. They can't even say.

31:44.852 --> 31:46.342
Or he might be fine, right?

31:50.925 --> 31:55.385
Either way, you're gonna love him
more than you can even imagine.

31:57.732 --> 31:59.324
I can't handle it.

31:59.634 --> 32:02.228
Sure you can. You'll have to.

32:03.104 --> 32:04.799
That's your son up there.

32:05.740 --> 32:09.642
The world is hard sometimes. It can't
always go the way you want it to go.

32:14.148 --> 32:15.843
I miss Dad.

32:21.389 --> 32:24.916
Is there any chance there might
be someplace that can take...

32:25.226 --> 32:26.250
...both of them together?

32:26.527 --> 32:28.154
Does she need nursing care?

32:28.429 --> 32:31.523
She may have a little dementia.
She seems a bit out of it.

32:31.733 --> 32:32.495
Time for rounds.

32:32.767 --> 32:35.292
Alden-Lakeland will
accommodate couples.

32:35.603 --> 32:36.831
Great! Great!

32:40.208 --> 32:43.302
I'm sorry. I have to go.
Rounds. I'll be back in an hour.

32:43.578 --> 32:46.342
You're the one with the
relationship with the wife.

32:46.614 --> 32:48.639
We won't get far without
your involvement.

32:48.950 --> 32:49.848
This is ridiculous.

32:53.621 --> 32:55.179
- I'm not coming.
- You're what?

32:55.456 --> 32:56.980
A patient needs my attention.

32:57.291 --> 32:59.259
Rounds are a requisite
for this program!

32:59.527 --> 33:00.551
So is patient care.

33:00.795 --> 33:03.195
Come to rounds now, or don't
ever come again!

33:03.498 --> 33:05.659
I'll be there if and when I can!

33:14.976 --> 33:16.841
All right, doctor.

33:28.156 --> 33:29.384
Anyone for cocktails?

33:29.624 --> 33:31.387
I gotta pick the kids up
at my sister's.

33:31.659 --> 33:32.683
- I'm in.
- Me too.

33:32.994 --> 33:36.555
- You got any money?
- Better than money, girl. Credit.

33:37.632 --> 33:39.896
Charlie's caseworker finally
showed up.

33:40.168 --> 33:41.760
This ought to be fun.

33:43.337 --> 33:45.897
Girl, you look great!

33:46.507 --> 33:49.704
Thank you.
If Dr. Minz calls, I'm on my way out.

33:50.011 --> 33:51.171
Okey-dokey.

33:51.412 --> 33:53.141
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:57.218 --> 34:00.551
- You know Miss Neuman from DCFS?
- Yes, I do. How are you?

34:00.788 --> 34:02.312
Charlie's resurfaced again?

34:02.590 --> 34:05.184
Yeah. Poly-drug OD.
Cocaine, meth, heroin.

34:05.493 --> 34:07.484
She ran away from the foster home.

34:07.729 --> 34:09.924
She said that she was molested.

34:10.231 --> 34:12.960
- Charlie says a lot of things.
- Yes, she does.

34:16.270 --> 34:17.464
Goddamn it!

34:21.976 --> 34:22.943
I'm out of here.

34:23.177 --> 34:26.704
If anybody asks, I left hours ago
and you haven't seen me.

34:29.217 --> 34:32.186
Pacer's capturing, vitals normal,
tapered off the dopamine.

34:32.420 --> 34:34.945
Mr. Munder is going up
for a permanent pacemaker.

34:35.255 --> 34:36.655
Doing better?

34:36.924 --> 34:38.824
Much. Thanks.

34:39.193 --> 34:40.091
Great. Take care.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.625
- Doctor?
- I'm sorry. I'm off duty.

34:42.864 --> 34:44.956
If you need a physician,
someone at the desk...

34:45.233 --> 34:49.260
I'm Judy Munder. I wanted to thank
you for saving my husband's life.

34:51.505 --> 34:55.306
It must be incredible, making
a difference in people's lives.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.204
Good night, E-Ray.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.410
Good night.

35:00.148 --> 35:01.479
I hate this.

35:02.550 --> 35:05.678
She's gonna need money to get high.
This is the fastest way.

35:06.387 --> 35:08.651
That pimp guy said he'd
be on a corner?

35:09.257 --> 35:13.353
Yeah. He didn't say what corner.
And how do you know he's a pimp?

35:13.594 --> 35:16.722
Dealer, whatever.
He's out here somewhere if she is.

35:18.166 --> 35:20.760
Pull over.
Pull over. We'll ask around.

35:21.035 --> 35:24.630
Someone's gonna know a dealer
named Tommy, hangs out with Charlie.

35:40.288 --> 35:43.257
Someone wants to steal your car,
that alarm won't stop them.

35:43.491 --> 35:45.288
So what are we doing out here?

35:45.626 --> 35:46.820
She reminds me of somebody.

35:47.128 --> 35:48.026
Who's that?

35:48.296 --> 35:49.160
Me.

35:52.834 --> 35:56.930
So you headed home for a special
dinner and some surprises?

35:57.238 --> 36:01.971
Probably just a potpie and a video.
Al's not much of a romantic.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.608
You guys are back together?

36:05.379 --> 36:06.437
You don't approve.

36:08.749 --> 36:11.309
I don't know.
Does it matter if I approve?

36:11.586 --> 36:12.553
It does to me.

36:14.388 --> 36:16.288
It would help if I understood.

36:19.227 --> 36:20.285
I don't know if I do.

36:22.496 --> 36:23.793
You know, it's funny.

36:24.665 --> 36:28.066
I'm happy.
I'm happier than I've ever been.

36:29.403 --> 36:30.427
How can that be?

36:30.805 --> 36:32.136
And that's because of Al?

36:33.708 --> 36:36.973
No, it's because of me.
I'm not afraid anymore.

36:38.179 --> 36:38.975
Of death?

36:40.848 --> 36:42.645
Of living my life.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.080
I see things now I didn't see before.

36:47.355 --> 36:49.220
I know what's important.

36:49.523 --> 36:51.354
I know what isn't.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.255
I've been in love with Al Boulet
since the first time I saw him.

36:56.030 --> 36:58.191
I was 16 years old.

37:00.201 --> 37:02.431
I know he's been in love with me.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.276
Good night.

37:15.283 --> 37:16.272
Good night.

37:34.702 --> 37:37.671
- Hey, baby! What's up!
- Can I have your name?

37:38.105 --> 37:39.868
This party gonna be booming.

37:40.808 --> 37:42.605
What's up with that party?

37:47.682 --> 37:48.649
Let's go, man.

37:49.450 --> 37:50.815
Let's go, man.

38:02.763 --> 38:03.991
Look who's up.

38:05.566 --> 38:06.692
You're not sleeping.

38:07.001 --> 38:08.525
I seen you.

38:08.769 --> 38:10.498
Wakey-wakey.

38:10.805 --> 38:11.669
Wake up!

38:12.606 --> 38:14.198
He's awake now.

38:14.809 --> 38:15.969
Yo, bro. Lend me $ 20.

38:16.243 --> 38:18.143
- I don't have any money.
- Sure you do.

38:18.412 --> 38:19.504
I don't have any money.

38:19.780 --> 38:22.271
- We gotta get us something to eat.
- Let's go.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.519
Shut up, <i> Ásse.</i>
I'm talking to my friend here.

38:25.786 --> 38:27.947
Glasses Man, we're hungry.

38:28.255 --> 38:30.155
You don't want us hungry, do you?

38:30.458 --> 38:31.425
This is my stop.

38:36.931 --> 38:38.899
You don't wanna give me
some money?

38:42.236 --> 38:43.430
Yo! We're getting off.

38:43.704 --> 38:46.537
- What?
- This is our stop. We're getting off.

39:05.026 --> 39:05.788
Back off!

39:06.060 --> 39:06.958
Back off!

39:08.162 --> 39:08.924
It's cool, man.

39:09.196 --> 39:10.220
Get on the train!

39:10.898 --> 39:11.762
Get on the train!

39:12.033 --> 39:13.728
- Get back on the train!
- Be cool!

39:14.001 --> 39:14.831
- Shut up!
- Be cool!

39:15.102 --> 39:15.864
Shut up!

39:16.137 --> 39:18.196
- Be cool, Glasses Man.
- Shut up!

39:18.472 --> 39:21.464
Chill out, Glasses Man.
Be cool. Chill out.

39:38.426 --> 39:39.188
Later.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.484
- Anything?
- No. You?

39:41.729 --> 39:44.254
That kid with the hair
saw Charlie yesterday.

39:44.532 --> 39:47.558
Said Tommy's usually around,
but she hasn't seen him tonight.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.134
Heard he and Charlie scored
some hash and a good squat.

39:50.438 --> 39:51.336
Anything else?

39:51.605 --> 39:54.870
That 15-year-old with leather pants
said she'd do you for nothing.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.040
That's something.

39:56.777 --> 39:58.802
- So what now?
- Come back tomorrow night.

39:59.113 --> 40:02.776
If they got a decent squat, they won't
come out until they need to score.

40:03.350 --> 40:05.511
All right. You want to get
something to eat?

40:07.555 --> 40:09.887
As in "something to eat,"
or as in something to eat...

40:10.191 --> 40:11.818
...that leads to something else?

40:13.694 --> 40:15.127
As in "something to eat."

40:17.264 --> 40:19.494
When did you and that nurse break up?

40:19.733 --> 40:21.030
A long time ago.

40:23.704 --> 40:27.299
How about this? How about you
drop me back at my motel...

40:27.975 --> 40:30.842
...and we hit some takeout
drive-thru on the way?

40:31.112 --> 40:32.170
Sounds romantic.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.656
I'm late for dinner, Dr. Carter.
Good night.

40:46.961 --> 40:48.622
Please.
It'll only take a minute.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.127
This is not the time or the place.

40:53.033 --> 40:56.264
It's not that I dislike surgery.
It's been incredibly challenging.

40:56.770 --> 41:00.137
The training has been excellent.
You're a wonderful teacher.

41:00.708 --> 41:01.732
Get to the point.

41:02.009 --> 41:05.968
I admire surgery, but it's not the type
of medicine I want to practice.

41:11.252 --> 41:13.152
I can be a competent surgeon.

41:13.587 --> 41:16.215
I can learn the techniques,
the mechanics.

41:18.425 --> 41:20.518
But I'll never be a great surgeon.

41:22.163 --> 41:24.597
Dr. Anspaugh, I can be a great doctor.

41:25.399 --> 41:27.833
A doctor who spends time
with his patients.

41:28.335 --> 41:29.495
Who's there for them.

41:31.705 --> 41:32.865
I'm good at it.

41:34.909 --> 41:35.705
Really good.

41:37.378 --> 41:39.141
I can make a difference
in people's lives.

41:40.481 --> 41:42.142
Don't make me give that up.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.409
Please don't make me waste it.

41:51.725 --> 41:54.250
I've often wondered over the years...

41:55.829 --> 41:58.093
...if I made the right decision...

41:59.400 --> 42:00.662
...in becoming a surgeon.

42:03.204 --> 42:05.604
But you seem so certain.

42:07.641 --> 42:09.666
What are you? Twenty-six?

42:09.977 --> 42:12.241
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

42:14.515 --> 42:18.611
What happened to your patient?
The one you missed rounds for?

42:19.954 --> 42:24.220
Mr. Curwane. I got him and his wife
into a nursing home. Together.

42:25.559 --> 42:26.856
It's supposed to be nice.

42:27.661 --> 42:28.889
I'm sure it is.

42:32.366 --> 42:34.266
You find me in the morning.

42:35.269 --> 42:37.237
We'll see if we can work
something out.

44:00.087 --> 44:02.078
So Toby doesn't get to come inside?

44:02.356 --> 44:04.381
God, you scared me!

44:04.658 --> 44:07.718
I was hiding over there
under the El tracks.

44:08.295 --> 44:10.991
You're lucky the neighbors
didn't call the cops.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.755
What are you doing here?

44:15.469 --> 44:17.733
So Toby doesn't get to come inside?

44:18.639 --> 44:22.803
It was only the third date. Toby
definitely doesn't get to come inside.

44:24.011 --> 44:24.875
What?

44:27.147 --> 44:27.909
What?

45:12.326 --> 45:13.816
Sit in the rocker.

45:16.630 --> 45:18.393
All you have to do is hold him.

45:19.833 --> 45:22.734
Support his head.
There you go.

45:28.776 --> 45:29.765
There.

45:33.447 --> 45:34.744
Now just rock.
