of years ago.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.011
Several billion light years
from home.

00:12.096 --> 00:16.181
We are on a ship, but we
have no idea where we are
in relation to Earth .

00:16.265 --> 00:20.019
RUSH: This ship could be
the most important discovery
mankind has made

00:20.104 --> 00:21.270
since the stargate itself.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.690

These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

SCOTT:
l've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.444
RUSH: We barely have
enough power to operate
the main systems.

This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth .

Chinese miners that survived
a cave-in for six days

00:40.666 --> 00:42.417
by drinking their urine.

and pretend
l didn't hear that.

they ate? Coal .

a true story.

You're sure
nobody went near that
compartment on your watch?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.727
Spencer came by
and asked if he could
have a look in the tank.

Why?

01:01.979 --> 01:05.982

01:12.489 --> 01:14.866
Maybe it evaporated
when we went
through the star.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.075

closed system .

01:16.160 --> 01:17.368

all that water
went somewhere.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.704

of what we had
when we got here.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.122

understand this.

You're the one trying
to get the recycling
system up and running .

Maybe there's
a leak somewhere.

saying is accurate. . .

a serious problem .

Well , we wouldn't

01:31.592 --> 01:33.092
if you did what
l asked you to do
in the first place.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.219
Oh , please, can we stick
to one problem at a time?

01:35.304 --> 01:36.804
Running out of water
wouldn't matter

01:36.889 --> 01:38.055
if we just dial Earth ,
go home. . .

01:38.140 --> 01:39.515

that to you .

01:43.020 --> 01:44.312
Well , where are we at,
then , Rush?

01:44.396 --> 01:47.607
Probably about less than 40%
of original design capacity.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.568
You think l can't tell
when someone just pulls
a number out of his ass?

01:50.652 --> 01:51.694
What?

01:51.779 --> 01:56.157
l actually pulled that
number out of my ass.
He's not making it up.

01:57.326 --> 02:02.246
Look, if Destiny
was ever capable
of dialing back to Earth ,

02:02.331 --> 02:03.623
it was thousands
of years ago,

02:03.707 --> 02:06.709

originally intended
to come here, but not now.

it wouldn't
surprise me

water than they're
telling us.

the water supply,
they control us.

as Lieutenant Scott

we've got aliens.

bursting out

as we move forward.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.779
Good job. Keep it up.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.789
SCOTT: How about you
lower the gun down,
and l shoot myself free?

28:27.873 --> 28:28.873
YOUNG: Yeah,
that's good thinking.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.417
There's no way the bullets
will ricochet into your ass.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.461
SCOTT: Well, maybe I can
cut my way out
with the plasma cutter.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.838
You get one hole
in that suit,
you're dead.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.257
Maybe there's a way for me
to get down there.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.259
No, that's just as stupid.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.637
"That's just
as stupid, sir."

28:43.639 --> 28:46.724
The last thing
we need is for both of us
to be stuck down here.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.142
(RUMBLl NG)

28:48.227 --> 28:50.228
All right. Break off.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.984
You okay?

28:57.069 --> 28:59.862
Closed in a little tighter,
but I think. . .

29:00.781 --> 29:03.032
What? What?

29:03.117 --> 29:04.117
(H lSSl NG)

29:05.411 --> 29:07.537
l think l'm losing
suit pressure.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.833
(MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)

29:21.260 --> 29:23.845
l thought we were supposed
to be confined to quarters.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.098
Yeah , well , l heard
over the radio. . .

29:28.600 --> 29:32.728
There was a tremor.
Lieutenant Scott
fell into a crevasse.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.105
Oh , my God .

29:34.189 --> 29:35.356
He's okay.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.317
J ust stuck.

29:38.694 --> 29:39.735
Do they have
enough air?

29:39.820 --> 29:42.155
Colonel Young
says he's got it
under control .

29:43.490 --> 29:47.910
l just thought
you would
want to know.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.667
Thanks.

29:54.751 --> 29:55.751
Yeah .

30:04.052 --> 30:07.388
YOUNG: I think the ice
tore a hole in his suit.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.307
ELl : How big
a tear is it?

30:09.391 --> 30:13.644
l can't see it,
but I can hear it.
lt's hissing out pretty good.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.482
An hour at most.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.233
YOUNG: Plenty of time
to make it back.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.360
Yeah, if l wasn't stuck!

30:21.445 --> 30:25.323
Colonel , you have to consider
the amount of time
you have left now.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.575
YOUNG: I'm aware
of the damn time, Rush.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.452
All l'm saying is if
you delay much longer. . .

30:29.536 --> 30:31.579
YOUNG: Listen to me!
l know exactly
what you're saying,

30:31.663 --> 30:33.456
and l'm not going anywhere
without Lieutenant Scott,

30:33.540 --> 30:34.582
and that's the way
it's gonna be!

30:35.459 --> 30:37.752
What is the matter with you?

30:40.172 --> 30:43.758
Miss Armstrong ,
you should return
to your quarters.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.885
No, you know
where you can go?

30:49.056 --> 30:52.934
Now, look, Colonel ,
l understand your desire

30:53.018 --> 30:55.645
to rescue
Lieutenant Scott,
of course,

30:55.938 --> 30:58.689
and only you can decide
how much time you have left,

30:58.774 --> 31:02.944
but, Lieutenant,
if Colonel Young
remains there

31:03.695 --> 31:04.862
trying to free you,

31:05.447 --> 31:07.823
to pull you up by himself,

31:08.784 --> 31:11.702
there's a chance
he might not make it back.

31:13.664 --> 31:14.872
SCOTT: He's right.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.959
YOUNG: Just keep
the gate active.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.044
We're gonna make
it back in time
with your damn ice,

31:20.128 --> 31:21.420
which is all you
really care about.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.798
Colonel . . .
Young out!

31:26.510 --> 31:28.010
Damn, he's a lot of work.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.330
This is Greer.
l locked them up.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.791
Closing off
the ventilation
in that room .

32:01.169 --> 32:03.212
Okay, vents are closed .

32:03.672 --> 32:05.131
Should be airtight.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.215
What are they doing now?

32:07.718 --> 32:09.635
G REER: Looking
for a way out.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.388
Let's hope they
don't find one.

32:19.104 --> 32:25.359
(GRUNTING)

32:26.194 --> 32:36.871
Come on!

32:36.955 --> 32:38.372
(PANTING)

32:47.507 --> 32:48.633
SCOTT: Sir.

32:51.428 --> 32:54.472
Colonel?
l'm thinking.

32:54.556 --> 32:55.556
Go.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.810
lt's okay.
No, it's not.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.520
Come on, sir.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.231
We both know you've
done this before, too.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.276
Done what?

33:08.111 --> 33:09.362
Lost people.

33:12.032 --> 33:15.743
Too many times. l'm not. . .
l'm not doing it again.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.496
l can't let you do it.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.206
You don't have a choice.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.460
Not that l'm counting,
but this is the third time

33:25.295 --> 33:28.673
in almost as many weeks
that you've been willing
to kill yourself,

33:28.757 --> 33:31.634
and there's a pretty good
chance, at this point,

33:31.718 --> 33:34.595
I won't be around
to talk you
out of it again.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.850
YOUNG: You know,
you're a fine
young officer.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.186
You've got a heart
as big as a house,

33:42.938 --> 33:45.106
but I'm not here
because I want to die.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.067
I'm here because
l haven't given up
on saving your ass,

33:48.151 --> 33:50.653
so just shut up and think.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.076
G REER: They're
getting pissed off.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.956
Really pissed off.

34:09.339 --> 34:10.464
A few of them got out.

34:10.924 --> 34:12.341
What? How?

34:13.635 --> 34:15.636
We need a plan , Lieutenant!

34:17.264 --> 34:19.181
l'm coming down there !

34:24.603 --> 34:26.731
This is beautiful
out here.

That's it, pull!

36:28.645 --> 36:31.355
Pull, Lieutenant.
Come on, Lieutenant.

Okay, that's it, I got you.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.124
You're okay.

36:54.296 --> 36:58.465
Hey, hey, Scott, come on.
Hang on, kid.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.974
What's the plan?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.309
We open the door,

37:08.727 --> 37:11.145
they go for the water,
we close the lid .

37:11.229 --> 37:12.396

37:13.565 --> 37:14.565
No, no, no, l will .

37:14.649 --> 37:16.275
l'm not the one
with the torch .

37:16.359 --> 37:18.402
No, look, l am not
gonna let you do that. . .

37:18.486 --> 37:20.237
l'm not the one who's
killed any of them ,
Sergeant. You are.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.072
l'll stand back,
torch them if they get out.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.616
No, l want you
out of sight.

What, you don't trust me?

37:26.328 --> 37:28.245
No, l don't.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.088
All right.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.195
Eli , l'm ready.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.573
Make us a clear path
to the Gate Room .
Seal off everything else.

lf this doesn't work,
lock this compartment off

38:13.875 --> 38:15.459
from the rest of the ship.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.719
l'm on my way back
with Scott. Come in.

at the stargate with Scott.

so I can dial in.

to send these alien bugs
through to the planet.

We've no other choice.

What?

39:12.267 --> 39:14.101
RUSH : We need you
to step away from the gate

39:14.185 --> 39:16.353
and remain as still
as possible.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.147

FRAN KLl N : Colonel ,
l need to talk to you

41:45.128 --> 41:46.170
about the behavior
of one of your men .

41:46.254 --> 41:48.380

We need to go over
the new rationing amounts
