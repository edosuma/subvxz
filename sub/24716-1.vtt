about Dr. Ed Miller.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.349
My dad told me to talk to you guys,
tell me what happened.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.852
Yeah. Well, we saw on
Dr. Miller’s cellphone records

12:50.019 --> 12:51.896
that he had some calls into you yesterday.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.316
-What was he calling you about?
-Oh, suggestions and what to do

12:55.399 --> 12:57.735
in New York, you know,
he was out here by himself, so.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.613
Did you give him any suggestions
as far as places to go.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.198
You know, restaurants, bars, like that?

13:02.281 --> 13:06.869
No, more landmark-type stuff, you know.
The Met and Guggenheim.

13:06.952 --> 13:10.623
Hey Eric, in going through
some of the checklist things we do, uh,

13:10.873 --> 13:13.584
you know, we ran your address
to see if there were any crimes

13:13.667 --> 13:17.296
or police responses, you know.
It says here you tried to commit suicide

13:17.379 --> 13:18.422
three years ago.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.257
That’s right.

13:20.508 --> 13:24.220
Yeah, that’s a personal matter, obviously,
but what jumped out was

13:24.303 --> 13:26.889
that it was Dr. Miller who dialed 911.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.725
-That’s right.
-Was he staying with you?

13:29.892 --> 13:33.062
No, it was actually
kind of an ironic situation.

13:33.270 --> 13:38.859
I... I was going through a breakup,
and it was just a real low point for me.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.530
And so, I did something really stupid,
and Dr. Miller was in town,

13:42.613 --> 13:47.284
and he happened to stop by after I did it.
I’m glad he did ’cause it saved my life.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.370
See, that looks a little odd to us.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.999
No, I mean, yeah, I can see
how it maybe does, but it’s not.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.669
Eric, I’ve been doing this
for a long time and I’m pretty certain

13:56.752 --> 13:58.504
at this point
we’re not getting the whole story

13:58.629 --> 14:00.214
as to what you know about Dr. Miller.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.386
Are you thinking I killed him?

14:05.886 --> 14:08.472
Why in the world
would I do something like that?

14:09.557 --> 14:11.350
Were you more than just friends?

14:11.725 --> 14:15.479
Oh, my God.
You guys are really tripping now. No.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.817
Dr. Miller, uh, he was a lonely old guy
and didn’t know a lot of people.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.279
And he just kind of like
clung to my family for some reason.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.489
I... I don’t know what else to tell you.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.826
-Where were you last night?
-Work and then home.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.370

RITA: So, the Street Embrace.

14:39.503 --> 14:43.132
Yeah. Oh, my God. What a great experience.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.426
You guys think we have it rough, right?

14:46.343 --> 14:50.472
In your travels the last few days,
did you come across a young homeless guy

14:50.556 --> 14:52.933
named Sean O'Leary?
His street name was The Illness.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.102
Yeah, yeah, I talked to him a little bit.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.104
He was gonna leave
for San Francisco today.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.357
Well, that’s not gonna happen.
Sean was shot and killed last night.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.985
-For real?
-Yeah.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.571
-Oh, my God.
-Do you know anything about it?

15:05.988 --> 15:09.992
No! Wow, I can’t believe that.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.702
While you were getting to know each other,

15:11.785 --> 15:13.704
Sean didn’t mention anyone
he was afraid of?

15:14.371 --> 15:17.666
He was with this hard-core group
of homeless street kids

15:17.791 --> 15:21.086
called the Gutter Punks.
And there was this other subgroup

15:21.170 --> 15:23.631
called the Crusty Punks
that they didn’t get along with.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.300
And there’s always
the old-timer homeless guys.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.010
But I think he got along with them.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.180
It is, like, wild to see.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.349
-But no names?
-No.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.102
Who was the guy you were hanging out with
who was also with Street Embrace?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.480
Charlie, I think.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.857
Did you guys exchange numbers
or anything like that?

15:41.982 --> 15:47.446
No. See, the rules are, when you show up,
you can’t bring any money

15:47.696 --> 15:49.698
or personal belongings
or food or anything.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.493
They really want you
to experience being homeless.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.913
We had to beg and sleep in shelters.

15:56.163 --> 15:59.333
Sean’s friends said you and Charlie
were buying things for the group.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.379
I cheaTed a little. I brought some cash.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.840
The problem we’re having
is the information Charlie gave

16:06.966 --> 16:11.512
to the organizers of the Street Embrace,
his I.D. his personal and contact info

16:11.804 --> 16:14.223
all of it was fake.
But it’s important that we find him.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.101
While you guys were hanging out,
did he mention anything

16:17.226 --> 16:20.312
in casual conversation about his family
or where he lived,

16:20.896 --> 16:22.356
where he hung out, anything?

16:22.481 --> 16:26.276
No, ’cause, you know,
I wasn’t really interesTed in his story.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.405
I was more into the stories
of the homeless people.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.365
They’re not all drunks, you know.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.827
Some of them had families
and college educations.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.328
It’s really sad.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.624
-Well, if you think of anything.
-Sure.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.259
Oh, sounds like a fun way
to spend the weekend, huh?

16:52.219 --> 16:55.514
-Can I give you some advice, Laura?
-Sure.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.434
It’s hard enough for a female
on the job to get respect.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.895
One of the ways to lose it in a hurry
is if you’re flirtatious with the guys.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.940
Because they’ll just run with it
and the next thing you know...

17:05.024 --> 17:08.736
-Who was I flirting with?
-I’m just saying as a general observation.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.572
Well, you didn’t generally observe me
flirting with a guy

17:11.655 --> 17:15.826
’cause I didn’t and I don’t.
If they do, it’s... it's usually harmless,

17:15.909 --> 17:18.203
and I let it slide,
and I don’t make a big deal out of it.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.581
Yeah, I know all about that approach,
and what I’m saying is,

17:20.789 --> 17:23.042
if you act like that,
you leave yourself open

17:23.125 --> 17:24.126
for a problem down the road.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.672
Keep in mind here, Rita,
this is my first day in this squad.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.716

in a work situation ever.

are with other women on the job.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.604

it has to be like that.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.857

23:04.091 --> 23:05.592
shadow his daughter,
keep her out of trouble

23:05.717 --> 23:08.345
-without her knowing it.
-She never knew you were P.I.?

23:08.845 --> 23:10.764
End of the first night, she made me.

23:11.181 --> 23:14.684
I guess her dad had done this before.
But she was cool with it.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.770
All she tells me is not to get in her way.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.231
So how’d you get mixed up
with Sean O’Leary?

23:19.731 --> 23:21.900
It was the second night,
and we were all hanging out.

23:22.442 --> 23:26.154
Sean, The Illness, whatever the hell
his name is, he wants to score some dope.

23:26.571 --> 23:30.033
So Zoe, she pulls out some cash
which she wasn’t supposed to have,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.786
and she fronts him.
When he comes back with some...

23:32.869 --> 23:34.704
some crack, she wanted ecstasy.

23:34.913 --> 23:38.667
But once he put that pipe in front of her,
she told me not to... not to interfere.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.252
What went wrong?

23:41.002 --> 23:43.588
Well, I go off to take a piss,
and then I hear screaming.

23:44.005 --> 23:46.007
So I come running back,
and I see Zoe yelling at him,

23:46.258 --> 23:49.094
calling him a no-good bum,
a piece of garbage, you name it.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.929
I guess he must’ve made a move on her.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.683
’Cause he says, "You’d be lucky
to have sex with me, you ugly pig."

23:54.891 --> 24:00.063
And that’s when her eyes go wide,
and she turns to me and says, "Shoot him."

24:00.439 --> 24:02.566
-I mean, she was high as a kite.
-So you shot him.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.026
Hell no. I tell her,
"Let’s get out of here."

24:05.110 --> 24:06.862
But she keeps screaming at me
to shoot him,

24:06.987 --> 24:09.197
and he keeps laughing
and calling her an ugly pig.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.032
And I can barely keep my eyes open

24:11.116 --> 24:13.326
’cause I haven’t slept
in the last two days.

24:14.035 --> 24:17.164
And then, for a second,
it looked like she was gonna chill out.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.917
So, then I.... I guess
I let my guard down,

24:21.084 --> 24:22.085
’cause the next thing I know,

24:22.169 --> 24:25.755
she’s got my gun out of my pocket,
and she’s pointing it at The Illness,

24:26.298 --> 24:29.217
daring him to say it again. He did.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.888
She shot him... three times.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.765
-What’d you do at that point?
-I took the gun from her.

24:36.016 --> 24:39.186
I told her that she needed to go her way
and that I’d go mine,

24:39.352 --> 24:43.148
and hopefully this wouldn’t come back
to bite us in the ass.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.486
Hell of a story there, Charlie.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.865
I wish I could’ve prevenTed it.
I wish I never would’ve taken that job.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.992
And God knows, what the hell made her
want to hang out

24:54.075 --> 24:57.370
with a bunch of winos for a weekend,
but that is what happened.

24:59.414 --> 25:02.459
-You’re gonna need to stick around.
-Yeah, I know.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.382
There’s no easy way to broach this, Eric,
so I’ll just lay it out.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.469
You changed your name legally
ten years ago, right?

25:13.011 --> 25:15.055
-That’s right.
-And since it was a female name

25:15.138 --> 25:16.139
you had before,

25:16.223 --> 25:18.225
that would indicate
you had a sex change, right?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.560
-What does that have to do with anything?
-Yes or no?

25:21.144 --> 25:24.397
-Yeah.
-In looking into Dr. Miller’s background,

25:24.606 --> 25:28.026
we saw that he was a sex
and gender expert back in the day.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.655
Did Dr. Miller perform
your sex-change operation?

25:32.405 --> 25:37.160
-Eric? Eric.
-I think I’m gonna throw up.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.290
(GROANS)

25:44.209 --> 25:45.335
I’m okay.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.129
What happened last night with Dr. Miller?

25:48.296 --> 25:51.258
Nothing. I don’t know,
I was at home. I didn’t kill him.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.219
Did he or didn’t he
perform your sex change ten years ago?

25:54.344 --> 25:56.805
No, I... I had it done here in the city

25:56.930 --> 25:59.683
by a Dr. Richard Broussar
and you can check.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.520
Eric... what the hell’s going on here?

26:03.895 --> 26:08.024
Nothing, I... I don’t know.
I... I was at home last night.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.193
This isn’t going away.
We’re not going away.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.737
So just tell us what happened.
We can help you.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.575
I was at home watching television,
and then I got up and went to work.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.285
I mean, I wrote all that down
the last time...

26:18.451 --> 26:21.162
No one can confirm whether you were home
by yourself or not.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.999
(SIGHS) I didn’t kill Dr. Miller.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.961
You’ve been carrying around
this big secret for ten years.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.506
You thought it was all behind you,
and this lonely old man

26:31.590 --> 26:35.510
comes back into your life
and maybe blackmails you for money

26:35.594 --> 26:39.848
or to do things for him
that you don’t want to do. Hmm?

26:40.515 --> 26:42.642
Now, if something like that
happened, Eric,

26:43.018 --> 26:46.021
it’s all very understandable
you reacTed in a bad way.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.482
I work my job. I mind my own business.
I keep myself

26:49.566 --> 26:53.028
and I never hurt anybody in my life.
I mean, that is the God’s honest truth.

26:55.238 --> 26:56.364
(SIGHS)

26:56.781 --> 26:59.618
Charlie’s out of his mind.
Out of his mind.

26:59.743 --> 27:03.163
-Which part are you disputing?
-Uh, the part where I shot that guy.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.291
I mean, are you kidding me?
That’s retarded.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.711
-Not in a million years would I do that.
-How’d Sean O’Leary get killed then?

27:10.003 --> 27:13.923
I don’t know. Yes, we were hanging out.
Yes, I smoked a little,

27:14.049 --> 27:15.800
and yes, I probably shouldn’t
have been doing that.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.845
But, after Sean tried to force
my head down on his crotch

27:18.928 --> 27:20.263
and after he called me those names,

27:20.555 --> 27:23.016
I starTed crying, and I turned around,
and I bolTed.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.352
-So, Charlie shot him?
-I’m not saying that.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.646
I don’t know what happened
but when I left,

27:27.729 --> 27:29.147
Charlie and Sean were standing there.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.817
All right. Well, since it’s your word
against Charlie’s,

27:32.901 --> 27:35.028
and you're denying involvement
and the bullet matches his gun.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.365
This falls on Charlie.
He’s getting charged with murder.

27:38.573 --> 27:39.616
You’re okay with that?

27:39.949 --> 27:45.121
Of course I’m not okay with that because,
in a way Charlie was standing up for me.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.957
But I left. I didn’t shoot that guy.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.794
All right, then.
We’re gonna need you to write that up.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.261
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

28:01.054 --> 28:02.138
Where you at with your case?

28:02.389 --> 28:04.641
Son copped to the sex change,
but he’s still denying involvement.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.060
So we got his dad coming in,
and we’ll go at him again.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.645
-Where’s the son now?
-In the coffee room.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.647

John, do a search for anybody
with the initials P.A.B.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.627
either on the job or in the system.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.213
-What’s P.A.B.?
-I don’t know, do you know...

28:35.588 --> 28:38.550

that you know of?

-Referring to the stubble you got going.
-I’ll be clean-shaven tomorrow.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.271
That’d be appropriate.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.773
(SIGHS) We got a little bit
of a deadlock here, boss.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.402
The bodyguard’s putting it on Zoe.
Zoe’s saying she walked away

28:57.485 --> 28:59.362
while the bodyguard
and the D.O.A. were still arguing.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.989
They’re both dug in on their stories.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.615
LAURA: The bodyguard’s downstairs
in a cell.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.076
Zoe’s in interview three. We’re gonna
let them think about it a while.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.078
Release the girl. Keep him in custody.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.873
Get the D.A’s office hip and let them
decide how they want to proceed

29:10.039 --> 29:12.333
’cause I don’t want to get
into an overtime situation

29:12.417 --> 29:13.418
if they’re both dug in.

29:14.294 --> 29:18.047
-RITA: We’re not angling for overtime.
-Fine, but just give it to the D.A.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.800
Well, problem is,
we... we tend to believe the bodyguard.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.136
Include that in your conversation
with the D.A.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.889
But based on just the facts,
they’ll go after them for a plea deal,

29:26.139 --> 29:27.182
which might be a railroad.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.851
This way, Mr. Pregitzer.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.731
Give it to the D.A.’s office.
Let them decide what they want to do.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.359
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

29:42.530 --> 29:44.491
You’re covering for your son,
aren’t you, Mr. Pregitzer?

29:44.991 --> 29:47.869
Because when Dr. Miller called last night,
it wasn’t about some whore

29:47.952 --> 29:49.913
who got the wrong idea
because we looked into it,

29:49.996 --> 29:52.373
and there’s no indication
of any of that happening.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.961
Okay, then here’s what happens.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.256
This case goes to a grand jury.
This case goes public,

30:00.340 --> 30:02.383
and that... that secret

30:03.009 --> 30:05.386
that Eric has been working so hard
to keep a lid on,

30:05.678 --> 30:06.971
everybody’s gonna know.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.057
Do you want that for your son?

30:10.683 --> 30:12.435
Eric’s been through so much as it is...

30:13.394 --> 30:15.230
more than any person
should have to endure.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.524
Did Dr. Miller know about the sex change?

30:18.733 --> 30:21.653
-Did he perform it?
-He did the first one.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.988
-Which first one?
-When Eric was an infant.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.449
When he got circumcised,
there was an accident.

30:26.658 --> 30:31.079
-What kind of an accident, Mr. Pregitzer?
-The device that they used was electric.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.331
There was a malfunction,
and he was burned.

30:33.873 --> 30:38.211
The whole organ was... It was gone.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.758
And, uh, Dr. Miller?
He came into your life at that point?

30:44.092 --> 30:47.095
He heard about it somehow.
He approached me and my wife.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.639
He had this theory about
nature versus nurture,

30:49.722 --> 30:53.142
and, well, he assured us it would work.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.145
-So he performed the surgery on Eric?
-Yes.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.524
And... and it was part of
Dr. Miller’s theory

30:59.607 --> 31:02.360
that once we commitTed to it,
we could never tell Eric.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.823
Well, that didn’t work. In his heart,
Eric always knew that he was a boy.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.909
And... and so finally,
we told him when he was 18.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.996
Three years ago,
Eric tried to commit suicide.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.706
Dr. Miller wouldn’t leave him alone.

31:15.164 --> 31:18.334
And when Dr. Miller called him
and said he was coming over for a talk,

31:18.418 --> 31:21.296
that was too much for Eric to take
and that’s when I told him

31:21.754 --> 31:27.510
that if he ever tried
to contact Eric again, I’d kill him.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.597
Are you covering for your son,
Mr. Pregitzer?

31:31.097 --> 31:36.060
No. I went to Dr. Miller’s hotel
last night, I knocked on the door.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.105
He answered it, and I shot him.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.984
-All right...
-See, I’d forgiven Dr. Miller

31:43.067 --> 31:44.277
for what happened back then.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.905
We agreed to it.
it seemed like the only option.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.451
But when he kept popping up
into... into Eric’s life,

31:51.576 --> 31:54.829
well, I warned him. He wouldn’t listen.

31:55.038 --> 31:59.042
-Why wouldn’t he leave your son alone?
-I don’t know. I mean, he was obsessed.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.046
It was like... like
Eric was his Frankenstein or something.

32:04.005 --> 32:07.967
He kept wanting Eric to go public,
so he could go down in history,

32:08.051 --> 32:10.970
I... I guess. (SIGHS)

32:12.972 --> 32:14.057

32:19.771 --> 32:22.273
We’re gonna go talk to Eric
to confirm this.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.110
Once we do, we’re gonna come back here
and help you with your statements.

-Hey.

32:48.716 --> 32:51.010

on that King Tut character?

32:51.219 --> 32:52.220
Yeah. Anything?

32:52.345 --> 32:54.430
Did you give him any money
for cooperating?

32:54.555 --> 32:55.890
-Twenty bucks.
-Why?

32:56.140 --> 33:00.269
I just saw him walk into a hotel nearby
with all new gear and a hooker on his arm.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.064
-Which hotel?
-The Camden Arms over on second.

he was planning on writing a book

33:23.710 --> 33:26.921
on the surgery, on my life,
how he saved me.

33:27.338 --> 33:32.885
He never got it. He’d just never admit it.
I always felt I was a boy.

33:33.011 --> 33:37.974

wearing a dress, getting teased,

33:38.182 --> 33:41.728
just wishing, I was dead.

Every year I’d go, and I’d have these
therapy sessions with him,

33:44.981 --> 33:46.816
and I’d tell him these things,
and he wouldn’t listen,

33:47.692 --> 33:49.193
even after my parents told me,

33:50.278 --> 33:55.658
and even after I had my sex changed back,
he’d never admit that he was wrong.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.995
He... he never apologized.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.330
Did you know your dad
was gonna go over there last night?

34:02.665 --> 34:07.795
No. All I did was tell him
that Dr. Miller had found me again,

34:07.920 --> 34:10.048
and he wanTed to write the book.

I ain’t got no money. It’s all gone.
And you ain’t getting that back.

-Where did you get it?
-From this white chick named Zoe,

35:52.024 --> 35:54.235
that was hanging out
with The Illness last night.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.736
Why’d she give it to you?

had been just reversed,

36:01.701 --> 36:03.786
and that had been me laying
down there shot,

36:04.620 --> 36:07.498
and The Illness had been offered cash,
he would have done the same damn thing.

on my consciousness.

I was headed back up
to the squat last night,

pointing a gun at The Illness

36:19.969 --> 36:22.263
and yelling,
"Say it again. say it again."

36:22.680 --> 36:24.724
Well, he must’ve said
what he wasn’t supposed to say

36:25.516 --> 36:28.644
’cause she went pow, pow, pow,
and The Illness was down.

36:30.313 --> 36:34.025
And I jumped back in the shadows.
And the dude that was with her,

36:34.275 --> 36:37.945
he came up and said something to her
and took the gun and boogied.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.199
And she just stood there.

"you just done?"

36:48.706 --> 36:49.874

who knows what. Girl was high, y’all.

if I kept her secret.

She said, "5,000 dollars cash,"
and I said I was done thinking about it.

And I met her in front of the liquor store
on Bleecker Street, 10:30 a.m.
