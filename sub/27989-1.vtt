00:35.326 --> 00:36.661
[sighs]

00:36.870 --> 00:39.914
[peppy rock music playing]

00:52.927 --> 00:54.804
[Stuart] What was it Thoreau said?

00:54.888 --> 00:58.308
"Most men lead lives
of quiet desperation."

00:58.641 --> 01:00.685
Something like that. I don't know.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.897
What I do know is bourbon,

01:03.980 --> 01:07.233
more than anyone would ever
want to know about bourbon.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.652
You're fired.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.699
[Stuart] So when my boss shitcanned me
for my lack of passion,

01:14.783 --> 01:16.785
it kind of hit me where it counted.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.454
Honestly, it was a mercy-killing.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.998
-I was sleepwalking through the days.
-[door opens and closes]

01:22.082 --> 01:24.417
You know, when I first met you,

01:24.501 --> 01:27.212
you didn't know sour mash
from the hole in your ass.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.341
Without the job, I really had nothing.

01:31.674 --> 01:34.427
Well, at least I still had
some sample product.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.472
So, I did a little sampling.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.350
Actually, I sampled my ass off.

01:41.100 --> 01:44.771
I sampled for days and days and days.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.941
[cellphone vibrating]

01:56.074 --> 01:57.158
Hello.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.702
-[Frank] Hey, buddy.
-Yeah.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.622
Listen, I think you
should come with us on our family trip.

02:02.705 --> 02:05.625
Two weeks in France.
I have the whole thing planned out.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.043
What do you think?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.336
[Stuart] Uh... I don't think so.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.382
[Frank] Come on, you know
how much Rosalind adores you.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.884
Plus, she wouldn't have to be
stuck alone with her parents.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.595
[sighs] Stuart,
you need to get out of the room.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.519
[Stuart] Good friends, Paris.
What did I have to lose?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.313
This is supposed to be
one of the best places in town.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.899
Why does everything taste
so much better in France?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.317
[Frank] Look, this is what
I think we should do.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.695
I just figure we have the cave painting
thing that starts at 10:00.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.531
Let's meet no later
than 8:30 in the hotel,

02:36.614 --> 02:38.074
so we have breakfast,
we have time to get there,

02:38.158 --> 02:39.617
in the afternoon,
we have the Rodin Museum--

02:39.701 --> 02:41.870
Dad, let's just be here. Let's just
be here and live in the present.

02:41.953 --> 02:42.954
-Right?
-Yes. Yes.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.414
[Frank] Exactly... that... that...

02:44.497 --> 02:46.082
I'm just trying to get
a plan in place, so we do exactly that.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.376
-Just put that goddamn thing away.
-Can I make a toast?

02:48.459 --> 02:51.212
-[Frank] Oh, yeah.
-To Rosalind and her PhD.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.923
-Mmm.
-And her brilliant thesis

02:54.007 --> 02:56.217
on post-revolutionary ideas of the self,

02:56.301 --> 02:59.345
and the paintings of Delacroix
and Boulanger.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.931
Wow. Stu is the one
on the table who has read it.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.224
-It was great.
-Thank you.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.477
I'm sure it was wonderful.
We're here to give Rosie a very good time

03:06.561 --> 03:08.021
because she's very timid.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.274
And we want to give her
an adventure much like mine.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.067
Because when I was here 25 years ago--

03:13.151 --> 03:14.986
-Thirty years ago.
-Whatever, 25.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.947
I... [laughs]
Let's just say I had a lot of fun.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.199
And don't ask me about it,
because I can't--

03:20.283 --> 03:21.784
I can't tell you about it.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.661
And, Frank,
you really can't ask me about it.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.829
-Not gonna ask you.
-Okay.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.290
Can we just run away together
and just leave them behind

03:27.373 --> 03:29.334
and live a life of ease,
just the two of us?

03:29.417 --> 03:30.543
Hmm.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.431
[Stuart] For the first time in a while,
I was drunk with hope.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.308
[metal detector beeping]
[speaking French]

03:46.935 --> 03:48.186
Oh, it's my phone.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.854
Empty your pockets.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.315
[metal detector beeping]

04:02.700 --> 04:05.370
-[sighs] Ah.
-What?

04:09.916 --> 04:12.877
Would you do me the honor
of being my wife?

04:14.837 --> 04:17.048
What? Stuart.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.757
What in the hell?

04:21.594 --> 04:23.304
Just get up. No.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.767
-We should have known.
-[Stuart] Rosalind, please.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.647
I realize this could be perfect.
I mean, maybe we're soulmates.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.732
What? No! We are not soulmates.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.360
You said we should run away together.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.153
-You said it.
-It's true. You did say that.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.906
I didn't mean that, no.
I did not mean that literally.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.867
I'm 26 years old.
You're what... you're 50?

04:45.076 --> 04:47.787
Maybe. [grunts]
But I feel young.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.373
Maybe we could just run away together.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.292
-What's going on here?
-He's trying to marry me.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.751
Well, of course he's trying to marry you,

04:53.835 --> 04:56.004
because you're a gorgeous,
sweet, beautiful woman,

04:56.087 --> 05:00.258
and you're a very pathetic,
unemployed, just sad, sad person.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.261
[Frank] Jesus, Stuart,
we invited you here to help you.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.889
You fucked this up.
I... I feel like I lost a friend. I--

05:06.973 --> 05:09.392
There goes the plan.
Great. Thanks. Thanks, buddy.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.104
You made it weird, Stuart.
Frank, I'm getting cigarettes.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.480
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.065
-No. One cigarette.
-I'm having the whole pack.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.151
-[Frank] One cigarette.
-[Tillie] No, I'm doing it.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.048
[Stuart] So, I guess,
I came to Paris to end up alone again.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.968
I had no idea what to do.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.391
But then you showed up
and offered to buy me a drink.

05:51.184 --> 05:56.355
[inaudible]

05:57.273 --> 06:00.068
[Stuart] And now, I've dumped
my whole story on a stranger.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.569
Cheer up, man.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.906
People are constantly fucking up.
You're not new in that regard.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.367
I'm actually very impressed
with how badly I fucked up, even for me.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.330
Oh, there, there, pal.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.041
I'll tell you what, my friend.
You're not going home today.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.501
Finish that.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.795
Anyway, what's your fucking name?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.421
Stuart McCreedy.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.759
Stuart? Had you pegged as a Bob or a Dave.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.719
I had you for a Seamus.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.221
Liam.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.305
Liam.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.932
All right, let's take a look here.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.479
[Liam] Says you're booked
on the 5:45 to Bordeaux.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.648
-[Stuart] Ah, okay.
-Oh, Stuart.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.025
[Liam laughs] Oh, you're in luck, mate.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.945
Most beautiful women
in the world live in southern France.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.573
Make you forget all other ladies exist.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.659
Ah!

06:52.787 --> 06:53.913
Ah!

06:54.497 --> 06:56.040
I don't think I'll ever be ready.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.961
-Ready for what?
-[Stuart sighs]

07:00.086 --> 07:02.255
-[Stuart] To be with a woman.
-Bonjour.

07:03.756 --> 07:04.924
[Liam] Bonjour.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.269
Trust me, mate, a few days
in the French countryside,

07:16.853 --> 07:19.230
you'll be amazed at how ready you are.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.692
Just don't go propose to anyone.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.902
Don't worry, I won't.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.406
[man speaking French]

07:38.541 --> 07:39.667
[Louise speaking French]

07:41.127 --> 07:42.378
Mmm.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.256
[Stuart] So, what's with the ankle boot?
How'd you injure yourself?

07:45.339 --> 07:46.966
[Liam] Well, I'm a footballer.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
I was down here on a trial.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.472
If you can't tell
by the color of my beard,

07:52.555 --> 07:54.223
I'm nearing the end of my career.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.434
And I rolled my fucking ankle.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.060
[speaking French]

08:00.771 --> 08:03.441
So, now you gotta go back home,
tail between your legs?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.068
I'm not going home.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.363
-Ever?
-Well, not yet.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.950
My family business will be there
for me when I'm ready.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.870
When I go back, I'm taking over sales.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.581
[laughs] You're no salesman.

08:19.790 --> 08:23.002
Perhaps, but she is.

08:23.753 --> 08:27.340
I would dearly love to sample her wares.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.425
How's your French?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.593
[answers in French]

08:31.844 --> 08:32.970
[chuckles]

08:34.764 --> 08:35.890
Do you want some?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.517
-Yeah.
-Oui.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.768
Merci, mademoiselle.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.811
-Thought she'd never ask.
-[Stuart giggles]

08:47.777 --> 08:49.695
-[Stuart] Merci.
-Thank you.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.076
Mmm.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.163
So, you speak English.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.165
-Not a single word.
-[chuckles softly]

09:02.583 --> 09:04.210
I see you're reading Modigliani.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.879
I love his elongation
of the feminine form.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.966
Ooh! I see you're an art connoisseur.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.717
Ah, I dabble, you know...

09:11.801 --> 09:13.261
-I read.
-So, are you a Parisian?

09:13.803 --> 09:16.180
-Sorry?
-[Liam] Are you from Paris?

09:16.264 --> 09:19.600
Oh. Well, no, I'm not anymore,

09:19.684 --> 09:21.644
but, um, I used to be, yes.

09:21.936 --> 09:25.022
-Well, this is exquisite.
-[Louise] Thank you.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.566
Yeah, I don't think
I've had this one before.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.402
Well, maybe they don't
serve it at your pub.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.946
It is marvelous.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.534
You know, you and I
actually are sort of in the same business.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.827
Are we?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.245
Mmm-hmm. I'm in bourbon.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.913
[Louise] Oh. Well, no, no.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.124
These are two very different things.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.417
How so?

09:44.500 --> 09:47.712
Well, wine makes you feel
warm and sensual.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.464
And whiskey dulls and agitates.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.757
-That is very true.
-That is not--

09:51.841 --> 09:53.092
-No. It's not correct.
-[Louise] I know.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.260
-It's not?
-No.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.053
Well, wine is natural. Whiskey's not.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.265
Well, maybe it's that you've
never had a top-shelf bourbon.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.310
Huh? And maybe you've
never had a top-shelf wine.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.145
Have you ever had an Old Fashioned?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.397
-A what?
-Old Fashioned.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.857
-[Liam] Shite, here they are.
-Who?

10:08.065 --> 10:10.443
[Liam] Your American family.
Two idiots and their daughter.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.695
Ah! Fuck!

10:14.363 --> 10:15.656
[Stuart] I don't see her.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.783
[Liam] She just got on.

10:17.908 --> 10:18.993
[grunts]

10:19.243 --> 10:22.038
Okay, I should probably
go out there and find her,

10:22.121 --> 10:23.205
-right?
-Aye.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.585
I'll just... I'll poke around,
and if I, uh, see her,

10:27.668 --> 10:30.588
I'll just let her know I'm on the train
and it'll be cool.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.839
I won't cause trouble.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.591
Yeah. Be bold.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.138
[Liam sighs and laughs]

10:40.056 --> 10:41.349
Who's the girl?

10:41.849 --> 10:42.933
That's not important.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.109
You two are a weird pair.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.903
Ah.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.739
Well, I literally stumbled
over him at the airport.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.367
Poor bastard had his heart broken.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.661
I'm just helping him forget.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.705
Huh. [stammers] Wait.

11:04.789 --> 11:08.084
You're helping him
forget the girl he just went out to find?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.963
Well, much like myself,
he's a hopeless romantic.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.193
No!

11:40.741 --> 11:42.618
Ugh! Gross.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.329
Uh... Bonjour.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.042
Uh...

11:50.126 --> 11:53.754
I suppose the gentlemanly thing
to do would have been to go home,

11:53.838 --> 11:56.257
but the change fee
on my ticket was enormous

11:56.340 --> 11:58.384
and the fare difference also big--

11:58.467 --> 12:00.094
Write the man a check, would you, Frank?

12:00.177 --> 12:02.805
No... she doesn't mean that literally.
I... I don't have the money.

12:02.888 --> 12:07.435
Now, Stuart, perhaps you would be happier
and more comfortable on a different train,

12:07.518 --> 12:09.353
maybe to a different station.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.022
Maybe to a different time zone.
Maybe straight to hell.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.400
I should let you know

12:14.483 --> 12:16.485
that I have plans
to continue on this trip,

12:16.694 --> 12:18.737
because we are after all, in France,

12:19.238 --> 12:23.492
the land that gave us Piaf,
the guillotine, André the Giant.

12:24.326 --> 12:28.205
Besides, I have nothing to go home to.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.498
Whose fault is that?

12:30.374 --> 12:31.792
I'm terribly sorry

12:32.376 --> 12:34.670
to the Sterns, this entire family,

12:34.753 --> 12:36.046
for screwing up so royally.

12:36.797 --> 12:37.882
In fact,

12:38.799 --> 12:42.011
I ask that you accept
this token of my apology.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.721
The engagement ring I purchased.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.806
-What the hell are you talking about?
-We should take a look at it

12:45.890 --> 12:47.391
and just see what he's talking about.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.601
Don't take it, Mom.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.561
Well, just a peek. For curiosity's sake.

12:50.644 --> 12:54.773
The stone is blue topaz,
13.4 carats, pretzel cut...

12:54.857 --> 12:56.025
[Frank and Tillie murmuring]

12:56.192 --> 12:57.526
No, Tillie.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.362
Will you take this ring?
It's yours, and you need the money.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.908
You take it, Stuart.
You get it out of here.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.868
What the... what are you doing?

13:05.993 --> 13:07.536
He handed it to me.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.413
-I'm not... I'm not...
-What's a pretzel cut?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.789
-[Rosalind] Don't ask me.
-What is it?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.041
I've never even heard of that.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.876
Ugh, we were having so much fun.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.727
The entirety of the game
is explained in the name.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.104
-Yeah. That's what I thought.
-That's the brilliance of it.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.856
[Louise] Yeah, so it's easy to remember,

13:35.940 --> 13:38.234
like, I'm playing football,
my foot is on the ball.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.318
[Liam] Wow, you're smart.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.279
Well, look who's back.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.156
[Louise] Any luck?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.492
I wish you hadn't told me
she was on this train.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.118
What are you bitching about?

13:48.202 --> 13:50.788
You know bloody well,
I never saw your girl get on the train.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.873
I've never seen her before in my life.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.501
Wait, you lied to him?

13:56.460 --> 13:57.962
It's called a gentleman's fib.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.673
So you and I could get better acquainted.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.925
The world will always welcome lovers.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.134
I agree.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.388
Wait, you're leaving?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.265
It's my stop.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.517
Can I get your number?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.436
Well, it's on the bottle actually. Bye!

14:15.104 --> 14:16.272
Hmm.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.361
What...

14:23.696 --> 14:24.822
What the hell are you doing?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.657
Getting off. I need some air.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.827
So, you're both gonna abandon a cripple?

14:32.204 --> 14:34.290
All right. So,
what's the plan now, Captain Redbeard?

14:34.373 --> 14:37.042
[Stuart] I don't know, okay?
I just don't want to be on that train.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.502
[Liam] Well, congratulations.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.546
We'll just take in
the beautiful shithole of...

14:40.629 --> 14:42.089
-Velines.
-Can you read this?

14:42.172 --> 14:43.883
-I don't speak French.
-Hey! Hey!

14:43.966 --> 14:47.136
Hey! Hey! What's her name? The lady.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.929
-[Liam] Shit, I forgot.
-[Stuart] Uh...

14:49.013 --> 14:50.431
What's going on? Are you following me?

14:50.514 --> 14:52.892
-[Stuart] Mademoiselle!
-[Liam] Madame! Beautiful wine lady!

14:52.975 --> 14:55.769
[Stuart] Uh, do you know when
the next train to Bordeaux?

14:56.353 --> 14:58.606
-[Louise] What am I, a travel agent?
-[Stuart] No, but--

14:58.689 --> 15:01.275
[Louise] I don't know, I think
it's the 6:30 or something.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.526
[Liam and Stuart] What?

15:02.610 --> 15:03.777
-[Louise] 6:30, but--
-6:30?

15:03.861 --> 15:04.862
It's past that.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.323
Well, there's no more train tonight.
It's tomorrow.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.492
-Tomorrow?
-Ah. 6:30 in the morning.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.494
-All right.
-What's going on?

15:12.578 --> 15:14.663
-That means we've got time for a drink.
-Oh. [chuckles]

15:14.747 --> 15:15.789
Come on, give in.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.959
I can see you want to take in
two hapless travelers.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.087
Okay, you know what?
I... I don't want to have a drink,

15:22.171 --> 15:23.797
but I'm starving. So what about dinner?

15:24.173 --> 15:26.300
-Oh...
-We accept your invitation.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.927
-Let's go eat.
-Okay.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.678
-Merci.
-We'll follow you.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.013
Merci beaucoup.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.473
-[Liam] We're going up that hill?
-[Stuart] Is there a taxi?

15:32.556 --> 15:34.642
[Louise] Yes, we are. [chuckles]

15:35.559 --> 15:37.019
Can't you walk?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.438
[Stuart] I'm not used to walking,
I'm American.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.316
Aren't Americans in shape though?

15:42.399 --> 15:43.484
[Stuart] No, we're fat.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.402
All right, this might be
a stupid question,

15:45.486 --> 15:48.906
but is there not a restaurant,
perhaps downhill?

15:49.990 --> 15:51.533
-You're not gonna regret this.
-That is a stupid question.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.494
This is a really, really great place.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.870
Just asking.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.582
[Stuart] Are we there yet?

16:14.264 --> 16:15.808
[indistinct conversation]

16:16.809 --> 16:17.851
[speaking French]

16:19.687 --> 16:20.896
[speaking French]

16:27.361 --> 16:28.487
Oh, this is Max.

16:28.612 --> 16:29.989
[greeting in French]

16:32.658 --> 16:34.952
Nice. So you got a Michelin star.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.705
I'm so glad monsieur approved.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.665
[Louise] Shall we do this?

16:39.748 --> 16:41.375
[speaking French]

16:42.251 --> 16:43.502
[Liam] Thank you.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.216
Oh!

16:53.053 --> 16:55.014
[Liam] This isn't too bad now, isn't it?

16:55.097 --> 16:57.224
Oh, and by the way, this meal is on us.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.018
All right? Your money, no good here.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.687
[speaking French]

17:06.983 --> 17:08.027
[Max speaking in French]

17:08.527 --> 17:09.778
Everything okay?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.321
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We were just, uh, speaking French.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.741
Oh.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.117
Wow! [chuckles softly]

17:19.621 --> 17:20.748
I'm starving.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.044
I could eat a dog's arse
smothered in gravy right about now.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.338
[Max] Louise.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.007
[speaking French]

17:30.591 --> 17:32.843
-I know this place.
-[Stuart] Good choice.

17:33.677 --> 17:34.970
Fill her up.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.435
-One of the perks of the house.
-[Max sighs]

17:41.685 --> 17:44.271
[Liam] Well, uh, I say we propose a toast.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.232
-Yes, yes.
-To our new savior. Huh.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.485
-[Stuart] Yes. Cheers.
-Cin cin.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.778
Cheers. Cin cin.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.448
[Liam] Mmm. That's good.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.991
Not too bad, huh?

17:56.575 --> 17:57.701
Ah!

17:58.285 --> 18:01.371
A delicate wine and an enchanting beauty.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.873
Yes.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.209
[Liam] You know, in my expert opinion,

18:05.292 --> 18:09.046
I do believe I detect
a bit of grapes in this one. Yeah?

18:09.713 --> 18:13.175
In this, I taste the tears of history.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.887
Fifteen hundred years of living and dying.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.181
For yearning for love.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.059
You know, uh, when I was a kid,

18:22.643 --> 18:26.063
I wrote poems, uh,
about flowers. So...

18:26.230 --> 18:29.650
When I was a kid, I actually
used to write poems for Christmas.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.819
And I was giving them as gift.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.988
-Aww.
-You know, actually, true story.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.908
One Christmas, I got invited
to Sean Connery's castle.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.160
Yeah.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.913
I mean, he wasn't there,
but still, cracking party.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.165
-Hmm.
-[Stuart] Good story.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.250
[Liam] Thank you.

18:46.375 --> 18:50.129
You know, I don't know about
these tears or love you're tasting,

18:50.212 --> 18:53.507
but this reminds me of
back home in the States,

18:54.133 --> 18:56.135
people age whiskey in wine barrels now

18:56.218 --> 18:58.971
to combine European culture
and American culture.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.015
-It's quite brilliant.
-He's obsessed with his bourbon.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.643
[chuckles softly] Spirits are killing us.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.647
Yeah. Tourists just wanna
get drunk really fast.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.775
That's not true.
A lot of bourbon drinkers sip it.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.404
Not to get drunk.
To elevate the conversation.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.447
Gets them talking
about getting drunk. [chuckles]

19:18.574 --> 19:20.742
No. It's a classic drink.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.456
-[Liam] This is not blood sausage.
-It's got to be.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.750
-Some kind of liver.
-This is duck-duck goose...

19:28.834 --> 19:30.002
"Some kind of liver"?

19:30.085 --> 19:31.628
[Stuart] Yeah, delicious.

19:31.753 --> 19:32.921
See, the key to a good meal

19:33.005 --> 19:35.674
is to eat as many different
kinds of animals as you can.

19:35.757 --> 19:36.800
[Stuart] Do you like lamb?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.260
[Louise] I don't really
like small animals.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.762
-[Liam] You don't like small animals?
-No, I don't like to eat them.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.265
Oh, you don't like to eat them.
You are an animal lover.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.058
[Louise] Yes, I am.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.769
[Stuart] In America, everybody
opens their doors for you.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.691
[Liam] It's so...
it's so pretty, it's almost a shame to...

19:52.774 --> 19:54.484
[laughter]

19:58.947 --> 20:01.116
[Stuart] To wonderful food
and wonderful people.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.410
-[Liam] Including me?
-For now.

20:03.493 --> 20:07.039
So, aren't you lucky
that we came with you, huh?

20:07.122 --> 20:08.332
I mean,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.460
where would you be
if we'd stayed on the train?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.296
Well, in my bed.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.589
[Liam] Mmm.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.299
Garçon!

20:17.382 --> 20:19.635
Mmm. His name is Max.

20:19.843 --> 20:20.886
-What?
-Max.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.221
Max.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.266
[chuckles] Pardon, my pal.
Uh, here you go.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.646
-Voilà.
-Thank you.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.397
-[Louise] Thank you.
-Wow. Thank you.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.941
Eh. My pleasure.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.527
-Mmm. I'm completely stuffed.
-Hey.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.697
[Louise] Oh. Well, that's not
a very polite thing to say in French.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.034
Oh, uh...
my stomach is filled with happiness.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.202
Nice.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.246
You think you'll be
needing an escort home?

20:47.329 --> 20:49.373
Uh... no, I think I'm fine. Thanks.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.042
Are you sure? I don't mind.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.711
Yeah, I'm sure. 100% sure.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.880
-She's fine. She's good.
-All right. All right.

20:57.422 --> 21:01.093
I just want to say, it's been
a real pleasure getting to know you.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.637
And, uh, you wouldn't happen to know

21:03.720 --> 21:06.890
of a cheap hotel
or youth hostel around here?

21:06.974 --> 21:09.893
Uh, well, there is the Petit Pomerol,

21:09.977 --> 21:12.896
that is just, uh,
all the way up the street.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.565
-Good spa?
-"Good spa"?

21:15.649 --> 21:16.984
[Louise] No, I don't think
they have a spa.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.447
The fuck is this?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.408
Per the instruction of Mastercard.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.161
Oh! The salty fucking bastard.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.997
Catch this, will you, mate?

21:30.455 --> 21:31.790
What, you know I'm good for it.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.550
-There you go. Good man. Good man.
-You owe me.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.307
I'm sorry about that. I'm embarrassed.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.599
Oh, that's all right. Don't worry.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.811
Me dad has me account number.
I'm a bit, uh...

21:52.894 --> 21:55.105
Fluid [chuckles] with my finances.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.231
All right. Yeah.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.941
Excuse me a moment. A second.

21:58.025 --> 22:01.737
Uh, Max. Max. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! [laughs]

22:02.446 --> 22:03.780
Uh... uh-uh-uh.

22:04.197 --> 22:07.034
-Is there a problem, monsieur?
-No, no, no, no, no. Uh...

22:07.367 --> 22:10.537
No problem. Uh... I have the money.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.373
Uh, I just need a little time. Time.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.624
Time?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.168
Yes, um...

22:16.626 --> 22:17.794
I have great credit.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.338
Uh, I just recently have

22:19.421 --> 22:22.090
maxed out my credit cards
purchasing an engagement ring

22:22.174 --> 22:23.633
which I have yet to return.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.802
Not a big deal. So, in the meantime,

22:26.428 --> 22:28.597
maybe I can give you
a couple hundred American dollars.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.807
Hold that, and I'll come back, and...

22:31.600 --> 22:32.976
Do you have this ring?

22:33.060 --> 22:34.936
-Do I have--
-The ring?

22:35.353 --> 22:36.646
Where is this ring?

22:38.482 --> 22:40.025
Uh, I do have the ring.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.368
Hmm. You will give me this ring,

22:50.619 --> 22:52.704
and I will hold it as collateral.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.083
Because I don't know you,
and I don't trust you.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.297
We're done.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.764
[Stuart] It's all good.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.404
So, where did she say this hotel was?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.824
It doesn't matter. We can't stay there.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.118
Right.

23:32.452 --> 23:35.288
Oh. I think I might have
drank a little too much.

23:35.747 --> 23:39.000
[retching, spits]

23:39.751 --> 23:41.795
-Some mate you turned out to be.
-[sighs]

23:42.587 --> 23:44.172
Artichoke? Did we?

23:44.923 --> 23:46.633
Oh, shit, we did. [laughing]

23:46.716 --> 23:49.344
I had to hock my $7,000 engagement ring

23:49.427 --> 23:51.012
for your big-shot dinner.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.099
Worth every fucking penny, mate.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.727
That was the best meal
you or I have ever had.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.020
What are you talking about?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.189
You just puked it up.
It's all over the bricks.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.233
Aye. Aye, aye, but...

24:04.442 --> 24:05.902
It's not a total loss.

24:06.903 --> 24:10.574
[laughing]

24:11.491 --> 24:13.493
[stammers] You give that back.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.454
Uh... fuck you
and the sheep you rode in on.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.914
[grunts]

24:18.039 --> 24:20.876
You watch it.
I'm a fucking professional athlete.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.503
-Come and get it.
-[laughing] You fucking jetty.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.297
-Come and get it, boy.
-You get back here.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.423
Come and get it.

24:26.506 --> 24:29.342
Oh, what a fat lot of good
that's gonna do you

24:29.426 --> 24:31.344
without this. Huh?

24:31.928 --> 24:33.889
-[Stuart blows raspberry]
-[laughing]

24:34.222 --> 24:36.474
You are an amateur.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.769
[sighs]

24:40.103 --> 24:41.688
[Stuart] Watch and learn.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.279
[laughing]

24:54.826 --> 24:57.454
[Stuart] Ah. Ah.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.424
[phone ringing]

25:09.507 --> 25:11.134
[Sharron] Wow, you still have my number?

25:11.218 --> 25:13.178
I thought I was that bitch
that ruined your life.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.721
Okay. Whatever. Listen.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.431
I want my job back,

25:16.514 --> 25:18.391
and I have something
you may be interested in.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.517
Really?

25:19.601 --> 25:22.520
I might have a line
on a vineyard over here.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.524
-You still there?
-I'm listening.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.526
Okay. It's, uh...

25:29.319 --> 25:31.071
Chateau Beauregard.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.406
What kind of money are we talking about?

25:33.490 --> 25:34.532
I don't know,

25:34.699 --> 25:37.911
but I just had dinner
with the owner tonight.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.121
And I'm still feeling her out.

25:40.664 --> 25:44.584
So, what do you think?
I make this deal, I get my job back?

25:46.253 --> 25:48.255
-I heard that.
-Heard what?

25:48.338 --> 25:49.923
You rolling your eyes.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.677
-So, are we interested?
-Maybe.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.554
Why don't you call me
when you've more fully felt her out?

25:56.638 --> 25:58.265
Okay. Deal.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.559
In the meantime,
I might need some walking around money.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.187
-Maybe seven or eight grand to--
-[phone hangs up]

26:05.188 --> 26:06.940
-Still there?
-[dial tone]

26:08.817 --> 26:11.111
[Liam] You better not finish that.

26:11.194 --> 26:14.614
[scoffs] You are a lightweight.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.242
No, you're the fucking lightweight.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.077
[clattering]

26:20.495 --> 26:23.123
Good one. Good comeback.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.208
You want some? You gotta earn it.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.044
Like, something sexual?

26:28.253 --> 26:30.213
No. Not like sexual.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.675
'Cause I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.012
[Liam] I need something to drink.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.199
[spraying]

27:01.369 --> 27:03.371
[Liam groaning]

27:17.010 --> 27:20.805
I don't know about you, but...
[belches, sighs]

27:21.389 --> 27:22.932
I feel refreshed.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.645
So, where are we going?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.273
I don't fucking know.

27:31.149 --> 27:34.361
We missed the 6:32
by 90 minutes, all right?

27:34.444 --> 27:36.154
-We overslept.
-[groans]

27:39.574 --> 27:40.742
Hey!

27:42.243 --> 27:44.204
Don't you think we should know
where the hell we're headed?

27:44.662 --> 27:46.039
Be my guest.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.458
Well, I guess I have to, then.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.001
Please, captain.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.419
-I will.
-Yeah.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.505
-Like this. This is how you do it.
-You're so good.

27:53.588 --> 27:54.756
This is how you take charge.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.633
Yeah. Take charge, Liam.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.720
[Liam] Find that cat
that shat in my mouth.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.562
Hey. This might be our ticket.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.606
Don't act like a degenerate.

28:11.689 --> 28:12.899
[Liam] Show level ten.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.402
Put the boot up. Get some sympathy.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.072
Bonjour. [stammers]
Uh... uh... we missed our tour.

28:19.155 --> 28:20.448
We... we lost our bus.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.699
Other bus, broken.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.118
-We get a ride?
-[woman] Yes.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.661
Ah! Perfect, perfect, thank you.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.923
[man] Oh. Chateau Beauregard.

28:42.971 --> 28:46.516
Damn, Lord.
Your sense of humor humbles me.

28:46.933 --> 28:50.061
So, let's see the new vat room

28:50.186 --> 28:52.272
built in 2014,

28:52.397 --> 28:55.817
where we have
a lot of steps of vinification.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.361
It's very modern, you know.

28:58.445 --> 29:01.322
-Wow! [laughs]
-[guide] And very unusual.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.451
-Oh, yes. This is pretty cool.
-[guide] It's specially designed for us.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.077
Please, come in, come in. Feel free.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.746
-[Stuart] Come on, you gimp.
-"Gimp"?

29:07.871 --> 29:10.206
Even with one leg,
I'm still faster than you, you bastard.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.208
[woman] If you wanna
make a circle, everyone here.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.376
Hello.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.170
-Bonjour.
-[tourists] Bonjour.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.797
This is a good time.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.883
Bonjour. Bonjour.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.098
Uh... welcome, everyone, um...

29:27.182 --> 29:29.559
-My name is Louise, and--
-Hi, Louise.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.312
My name is Louise, and I'm

29:32.395 --> 29:35.190
one of the owner
of the Chateau de Beauregard.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.443
Um, today, we're gonna start

29:38.526 --> 29:42.530
by our 2016 vintage Chateau de Beauregard.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.782
I had some of this in the train.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.326
As you can see, and as Vincent told you,

29:46.409 --> 29:50.288
the fermentation of the wine
happen in those concrete vats

29:50.371 --> 29:52.624
-that you could see all over the room.
-[man] Concrete?

29:52.707 --> 29:55.126
-Yes, and--
-I thought all modern vineyards

29:55.210 --> 29:56.669
were going to stainless steel.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.422
Yes, uh, no, actually,
you know, uh,

29:59.672 --> 30:03.301
concrete is better to conserve
the temperature of the wine.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.845
-It's way better than--
-[man] What about oak or something?

30:05.929 --> 30:07.597
No, oak... the--

30:07.806 --> 30:10.183
-And the bottles are made of?
-Sorry?

30:10.266 --> 30:12.143
[woman] The bottles. They're made of?

30:13.770 --> 30:14.854
Glass.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.692
Um, may we taste?

30:20.109 --> 30:21.736
-It's okay to try?
-Yeah, of course.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.322
Please, everyone.
Let's, uh... let's all take a glass.

30:24.572 --> 30:28.284
Please, uh, hold it by the stem. Okay?

30:28.952 --> 30:30.787
Swirl it around gently.

30:31.037 --> 30:34.123
This opens up the wine
and draws oxygen into it.

30:34.457 --> 30:38.628
Now close your eyes,
take a moment and inhale the bouquet.

30:41.464 --> 30:44.425
Imagine the history of the land
that you stand upon now.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.344
Millions and millions of years

30:46.427 --> 30:49.806
of sediment and gravel deposited here

30:50.306 --> 30:52.976
to feed this unique rootstock.

30:53.268 --> 30:56.104
Every glass of wine is a courtship.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.481
An encounter with Mother Earth.

30:59.315 --> 31:00.525
Exactly.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.571
Now, go ahead. Taste it.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.573
Roll it on the palate.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.158
Feel the wine before you swallow.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.328
Mmm.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.208
This wine reminds me
of a cold winter night,

31:17.709 --> 31:20.461
sitting by a fire, reading Balzac.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.005
[laughing]

31:23.298 --> 31:24.674
Ah, madame.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.677
And what does this wine say to you?

31:29.012 --> 31:30.805
Something I can't say out loud.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.975
-[tourists chuckle]
-Indeed. It is a sensual beverage.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.727
It warms the heart.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.354
[Liam] Bloody good stuff.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.944
[Liam] Bye now! Good people.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.321
-[Stuart] Nice people.
-[Liam] Good people.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.157
[Stuart] All right,
let's see how this goes.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.783
She's got to have room for us.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.578
[Liam] Look at this. [laughs]
Are you fucking kidding me?

31:53.661 --> 31:56.122
Room? We're doing her a favor.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.833
[man coughing]

31:58.917 --> 32:00.001
Gerard?

32:00.418 --> 32:05.548
Uh, may I introduce you
to, uh, Liam and, uh... [babbles]

32:05.632 --> 32:07.008
-Stuart.
-Stuart.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.136
This is Gerard. He's the one
who created this beautiful place.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.722
Uh, I met them yesterday in the train,

32:12.805 --> 32:15.350
and Stuart helped me
a lot today at the wine tour.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.852
You know, I can't stand
doing those anymore.

32:17.936 --> 32:18.978
Oh.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.814
I didn't do that much.
I just love talking about wine.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.359
-Don't be so humble.
-[Gerard chuckles]

32:24.442 --> 32:27.403
Not bad for an American, which I can say

32:27.487 --> 32:30.323
with all due respect
as an American myself.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.867
Well, this here isn't bad for an American.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.452
This is the most modern,
impressive vineyard

32:34.535 --> 32:35.536
-I've ever seen.
-Yes.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.705
-[coughs]
-[Louise] Oh, thank you.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.082
My life's work.

32:39.749 --> 32:40.917
Where you from in the States?

32:41.250 --> 32:43.378
-Oh, uh, Louisville, Kentucky.
-[Gerard] Ah.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.922
Nashville without the music.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.758
Excuse me. [coughing]

32:48.841 --> 32:49.884
He's tired.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.053
Oh. Please sit down. Let's have a drink.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.472
-Oh, merci.
-Another one.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.352
Oh. I think we must have sold
40 cases to that guy.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.437
I don't know what a regular day's take is,

33:01.521 --> 33:04.023
but I'd say that's
a pretty good afternoon.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.734
I don't know much,
but I am good at selling.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.988
You're so good at it. I hate selling.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.240
Feels like a punishment to me.

33:12.573 --> 33:15.284
But, you know, since Gerard's illness,
it's all falling on me.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.369
What can I do?

33:16.661 --> 33:19.998
Well, the trick is
to get the customer to pitch the product.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.708
People are looking for an excuse to buy.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.167
You just have to get them talking,

33:23.251 --> 33:25.378
and they'll come up
with the right one for themselves.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.255
That's true, but I mean, come on,

33:27.338 --> 33:29.966
with a face like that,
how do you not sell 40 cases?

33:30.049 --> 33:32.176
Of course, I meant, yeah.
Of course, I meant that.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.095
-Yeah.
-[Louise sighs]

33:34.178 --> 33:36.055
What a day. Well, excuse me,

33:36.139 --> 33:38.307
but now I have to make Gerard's dinner.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.226
What's on the menu? Cassoulet?

33:40.309 --> 33:41.352
Oh, no.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.896
I'm just gonna open
one or two cans of soup.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.399
Come on. We can do better than that.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.359
"We can"? What do you mean?

33:48.443 --> 33:51.237
Like, you're suddenly gonna tell me
that you're also an amazing cook?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.406
Well, I'm pretty sure you got
everything here I need.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.074
Give me a second.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.826
-[laughs] What?
-May I?

33:57.326 --> 33:59.245
Oh, the fridge is on the right.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.664
-Uh, okay, got it.
-Can... can I help?

34:01.748 --> 34:04.709
No, no, no. You just be yourself.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.294
All right? That's all the help we need.

34:12.675 --> 34:13.717
All right.

34:17.513 --> 34:19.681
[indistinct chattering]

34:22.226 --> 34:25.313
Serious. Serious. And then playful.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.023
[laughing]

34:36.657 --> 34:37.699
No.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.621
[chopping rapidly]

34:46.876 --> 34:48.585
[laughing]

34:56.719 --> 34:58.888
Oh, do you know where this wine is from?

34:58.971 --> 35:01.891
I'm going to guess. France.
But I could be wrong.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.935
Yeah. But where in France?

35:04.644 --> 35:06.020
What town is this?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.146
[Louise laughing]

35:10.108 --> 35:11.818
[indistinct conversation]

35:16.864 --> 35:18.074
What?

35:22.161 --> 35:23.329
Mmm.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.587
[Liam] They crash glasses,

35:31.754 --> 35:34.006
spilling a little bit
of their wine into the other man's cup.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.091
[laughing]

35:35.174 --> 35:36.801
So if you're gonna poison him,
well, then, you're fucked too.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.302
-Where did you read this?
-It's nothing.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.555
-[Louise] You just invented this.
-[Liam] I'm a wealth of...

35:40.638 --> 35:41.931
Voilà!

35:42.598 --> 35:45.309
[gasps] Whoa!

35:47.061 --> 35:48.312
-Good for you, mate.
-Mmm-hmm.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.231
Where did you find those vegetables?

35:50.314 --> 35:52.984
-In my fridge?
-In the refrigerator. And on the counter.

35:53.067 --> 35:55.236
-Well, thank you so much.
-Bon appétit.

35:55.319 --> 35:59.574
Oh, wait, keep this for me.
I'm gonna take this to Gerard.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.118
-[Liam] Mmm. Mmm, mmm.
-He's gonna love it.

36:03.452 --> 36:07.039
Where's your manners, jackass?
You're eating like a hired hand.

36:07.582 --> 36:08.875
All right, look.

36:09.959 --> 36:14.422
You've got your certain set of skills,
and I've got my particular charms.

36:14.505 --> 36:17.341
So, you might be good
at talking about wine,

36:17.425 --> 36:21.012
but I'm a virile footballer.
Huh? Like David Beckham.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.306
Ah. So, she's like Posh Spice?

36:23.556 --> 36:24.599
Well...

36:24.682 --> 36:27.810
In case you haven't noticed,
that is a sophisticated woman.

36:27.894 --> 36:28.895
[Liam] Oh!

36:28.978 --> 36:31.063
She's into my maturity and knowledge.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.899
"Maturity" being the keyword.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.568
Okay. [sighs]

36:35.693 --> 36:37.528
[Liam] Mmm. Mmm!

36:39.238 --> 36:40.698
You gotta try that.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.909
Okay, I'm trying.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.623
Mmm, it's so good.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.208
Just simple.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.543
Give me a little time,
I'll knock your socks off.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.507
So, this didn't turn out
too bad now, did it?

36:59.258 --> 37:00.343
No.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.221
Super generous of her
to put us up like this.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.931
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.975
You know, I'm not sure, but...

37:08.559 --> 37:11.187
I think I was detecting
quite a bit of heat

37:11.270 --> 37:12.688
between she and I over dinner.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.399
Yeah. Well, you know,

37:15.483 --> 37:17.568
between that, uh, sleazy restaurateur

37:17.652 --> 37:20.029
and that old uncle or whatever he is,

37:20.446 --> 37:22.573
she might lonely enough
to give you a throw.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.496
Uh...

37:29.413 --> 37:30.581
I was shit-talking,

37:30.665 --> 37:33.501
exaggerating for a fact,
I don't believe any of that.

37:45.596 --> 37:46.973
Bathroom's yours.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.561
[door creaks open]

38:07.660 --> 38:09.245
-Oh, uh...
-Oh, uh, hi.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.580
-Sorry, I was... I was just...
-I was just...

38:11.664 --> 38:13.249
Having a bit of a look about.

38:41.777 --> 38:45.489
[speaking French]

38:52.747 --> 38:53.873
[Louise] Mmm-hmm.

39:08.637 --> 39:09.847
[Louise speaks]

39:38.709 --> 39:40.127
[woman 1 speaks]

40:01.148 --> 40:02.983
[cutlery clanking]

40:08.322 --> 40:09.698
Good morning.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.283
-Hi.
-Mmm.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.828
Perhaps we could
have a sequel to last night?

40:13.953 --> 40:17.456
Hey, you know,
yesterday was fun, but that was it.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.375
Well, we could have a little more fun.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.919
No, I don't think so. Sorry.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.256
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.299
Uh, breakfast is ready.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.013
-What's going on there?
-Hmm.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.307
[scoffs] French women.

40:37.935 --> 40:38.978
That's good.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.455
You're still here?

40:59.415 --> 41:01.459
Uh, oui. Um...

41:02.835 --> 41:06.088
I just wanted to say I didn't want
to insult you last night, I didn't...

41:06.714 --> 41:07.756
I didn't mean that.

41:09.675 --> 41:13.179
And, uh, I also came to say, uh...

41:13.888 --> 41:15.764
[speaking French]

41:19.393 --> 41:20.853
What are you trying to say?

41:21.270 --> 41:23.063
To say goodbye is like a small death.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.858
Oh, right. Yeah. No, so you...

41:25.941 --> 41:29.653
You actually said something like,
"To say goodbye is like...

41:30.571 --> 41:32.698
Mourning a midget."

41:33.532 --> 41:35.493
I would never say that.
That's not what I meant.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.119
-Okay.
-Um...

41:37.203 --> 41:39.288
But merci beaucoup.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.625
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

41:45.836 --> 41:46.837
Stuart?

41:48.547 --> 41:49.632
Um...

41:52.092 --> 41:53.969
I do get lonely sometimes.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.639
Well,

41:57.389 --> 41:59.892
I get lonely pretty much anywhere.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.651
Tomorrow is market day.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.444
And, uh...

42:11.904 --> 42:13.447
Why don't you come shopping with me?

42:14.657 --> 42:17.952
We're having a party for
Gerard's birthday on Thursday,

42:18.035 --> 42:20.663
and I could force your magic
in the kitchen again.

42:21.872 --> 42:25.167
I would love to.
I'd be happy to cook anything.

42:26.669 --> 42:27.878
I would love that.

42:29.129 --> 42:30.965
-Great.
-Merci. Merci.

42:32.216 --> 42:34.635
You're very talented.

42:36.178 --> 42:38.097
-Really.
-Thank you.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.017
All I can think is,

42:42.643 --> 42:44.478
I see this landscape, I'm like,

42:44.728 --> 42:47.690
what is it like to live
in this kind of beauty day-to-day?

42:49.733 --> 42:50.776
Well,

42:52.319 --> 42:53.862
sometimes it's boring,

42:55.072 --> 42:57.491
and sometimes it's not.

43:00.286 --> 43:03.706
Well, my apartment back home
overlooks a KFC, so...

43:04.707 --> 43:07.209
[sighs] KFC!

43:07.293 --> 43:09.878
Just the sound of it turns me on.

43:10.713 --> 43:13.173
I don't think KFC
means the same thing over here.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.634
Well, I think it kind of does.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.094
[speaking French]

43:17.720 --> 43:18.971
Uh, pardon?

43:19.471 --> 43:20.514
Chicken fingers?

43:20.764 --> 43:22.433
Yeah, that's KFC.

43:22.808 --> 43:24.685
You're very passionate about your chicken.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.816
I actually used to paint
a little bit myself.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.192
Really?

43:34.069 --> 43:35.154
Show me.

43:43.287 --> 43:46.624
I painted this place so many time,
I've never seen it this way.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.084
Thank you.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.544
You're welcome.

43:57.468 --> 44:00.888
Is it... is it the sunset?
Or it's the... yeah.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.931
Mmm-mmm. It's a comet.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.267
-Huh?
-You know, comet?

44:05.351 --> 44:06.352
Yeah.

44:07.686 --> 44:08.729
Well,

44:09.480 --> 44:11.940
that is gonna just, like, fall one day,

44:12.024 --> 44:14.777
or is it premonit...
a premonition, or...

44:14.860 --> 44:17.905
It's a celestial event.
I think it lands in the vineyard.

44:17.988 --> 44:19.573
It doesn't harm the chateau.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.658
[laughs]

44:22.076 --> 44:23.494
[Louise] It's pretty bold.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.538
-[Stuart] Masculine?
-[Louise] Yeah.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.376
-[Stuart] I like yours, too.
-[Louise] Thank you.

44:30.459 --> 44:31.752
[Stuart] It's very detailed.

44:31.835 --> 44:33.671
[Louise] I was thinking of maybe like

44:33.962 --> 44:36.048
adding your face somewhere here.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.592
-[Stuart] In the dirt?
-[Louise laughs] No.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.511
[Stuart] I don't know
if that's a compliment.

44:42.304 --> 44:44.682
Oh, my God. Look at these mushrooms.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.517
They're perfect.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.018
Well, you know what,
mushrooms are dangerous.

44:48.102 --> 44:51.230
I don't really trust this woman.
She might wanna poison you.

44:51.313 --> 44:54.066
[chuckles] Well,
before she assassinates us,

44:54.149 --> 44:55.859
we're gonna get all her mushrooms.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.444
Trust me, I got your back.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.321
Mmm, Stuart.

45:00.072 --> 45:02.074
I could use a bit of your enthusiasm.

45:03.075 --> 45:05.035
It's the curse
of the salesman. I don't know.

45:05.119 --> 45:06.662
Well, talking about salesmen...

45:06.745 --> 45:08.705
Oh, wait, I'm gonna get some bread.

45:08.789 --> 45:09.915
Don't you have a job?

45:09.998 --> 45:12.292
Like, when are those vacation ending?

45:12.376 --> 45:15.045
Uh, I'm kind of
between positions right now.

45:15.129 --> 45:16.588
[Louise] You mean you're unemployed?

45:16.922 --> 45:18.132
[speaking French]

45:18.632 --> 45:20.384
Yeah, you could say that, I guess.

45:20.926 --> 45:22.302
But I'd like to think

45:22.386 --> 45:25.556
I'm sort of just trying to
figure out what's next.

45:28.308 --> 45:29.435
So, what's next?

45:32.020 --> 45:33.772
Uh, well...

45:33.856 --> 45:35.190
-[girl] Bonjour.
-Bonjour. Ça va?

45:35.274 --> 45:36.358
Bonjour.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.820
-[Stuart] What? Merci.
-[laughing]

45:39.903 --> 45:41.780
Look at that. Lucky apple.

45:42.739 --> 45:44.992
What's next? I guess,

45:46.326 --> 45:47.744
I'm really loving France,

45:47.828 --> 45:50.539
so I might just
stick around here for a while.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.792
Hmm, so France solves everything?

45:56.879 --> 46:00.549
Well, if you want to,
you could stay in the guest house.

46:00.632 --> 46:02.301
You know, I could give you, uh...

46:03.260 --> 46:05.095
Friends and family rates.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.557
I'll take that.

46:12.811 --> 46:15.647
Has anyone ever told you,
you smile a lot?

46:19.109 --> 46:21.653
You're just as beautiful
when you don't smile.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.451
Well, for some reason,
I don't feel the need

46:27.534 --> 46:29.453
to smile so much around you.

46:31.663 --> 46:33.081
Is it a good sign?

46:33.165 --> 46:35.167
Yes. I'd say yes.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.504
Oh, here's your meat.

46:39.505 --> 46:40.672
Lamb!

46:40.797 --> 46:42.633
-Okay, let's go for it.
-We're doing lamb.

46:42.716 --> 46:44.426
Do we take a number? Is it like a deli?

46:44.510 --> 46:46.386
No, we don't take a number.

46:46.637 --> 46:47.930
[speaking French]

46:48.764 --> 46:50.849
-Ten lambs.
-Ten lambs?

46:50.933 --> 46:52.518
-What? No.
-Ten leg of lamb.

46:52.768 --> 46:54.228
[speaking French]

46:54.895 --> 46:57.231
Hook her up. I'm with Louise. Hook us up.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.110
[humming a tune]

47:09.409 --> 47:11.745
[Louise] I think I've
heard that song before.

47:14.331 --> 47:16.041
[Stuart] It is one of my favorite songs.

47:16.124 --> 47:17.376
[Louise] It is?

47:23.048 --> 47:24.800
[laughing]

47:25.384 --> 47:28.303
[indistinct conversation]

47:30.138 --> 47:31.473
Usually I need... I need...

47:31.765 --> 47:34.268
I need some help to wash my hands.

47:36.144 --> 47:38.021
[indistinct conversation]

47:43.860 --> 47:45.571
-Very good.
-Thank you.

47:45.654 --> 47:48.282
I have the right...
It's like painting.

47:49.783 --> 47:51.243
[laughs]

47:52.077 --> 47:53.787
[indistinct chatter]

48:00.836 --> 48:02.254
Go slow. You.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.631
-There's other people.
-I am...

48:08.427 --> 48:11.054
[indistinct conversation]

48:11.388 --> 48:12.681
[laughter]

48:20.022 --> 48:21.732
-Bonjour.
-Ça va?

48:22.107 --> 48:23.233
Liam.

48:43.211 --> 48:46.715
[singing "Happy Birthday" in French]

49:06.652 --> 49:08.820
[all cheering]

49:13.033 --> 49:14.117
[grunts]

49:14.201 --> 49:17.913
Merci. Merci beaucoup. [sighs]

49:18.205 --> 49:19.539
[speaking French]

49:21.041 --> 49:22.292
[all speaking French]

49:25.837 --> 49:29.633
Oh, and a toast to our beautiful hostess.

49:29.716 --> 49:31.635
[guests murmur approval]

49:31.718 --> 49:33.512
Well, thank you, um...

49:34.429 --> 49:37.683
Actually, thank you so much,
Stuart, for this amazing dinner.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.351
[all] To Stuart.

49:39.434 --> 49:41.395
[Stuart] No. No. No. No. No. No.

49:41.937 --> 49:44.815
A chef is only as good as his sous-chef.

49:45.190 --> 49:48.485
And a meal only as good
as the company you share it with.

49:49.194 --> 49:50.237
To the birthday boy.

49:50.862 --> 49:52.656
[all] To the birthday boy.

49:52.906 --> 49:55.325
-[Liam] Happy birthday.
-Merci.

49:56.993 --> 49:58.995
Hmm, all right. Cake?

50:00.789 --> 50:01.915
[speaking French]

50:05.502 --> 50:06.795
What did he say?

50:07.129 --> 50:09.923
Oh, he just said that
he wants to hire you as a cook.

50:10.590 --> 50:12.175
You're a good liar.

50:14.094 --> 50:15.262
Would you like a strawberry?

50:15.429 --> 50:16.513
-Yes.
-Yeah?

50:16.680 --> 50:19.224
[strumming slow tune]

51:08.398 --> 51:10.567
[all cheering]

51:16.198 --> 51:18.325
[strumming peppy tune]

51:21.995 --> 51:23.371
[inaudible]

51:30.462 --> 51:32.672
[all laughing and cheering]

52:36.069 --> 52:37.863
[all cheering]

52:47.330 --> 52:48.748
[Louise] What are you thinking?

52:49.666 --> 52:50.834
[Stuart] Who, me?

52:52.252 --> 52:55.255
[Louise] No, the other guy
holding my hand.

52:58.633 --> 53:00.176
[Stuart] Uh...

53:00.260 --> 53:02.971
Just wondering.
I thought you and Liam were, uh...

53:03.054 --> 53:04.514
[Louise] Oh, no. No.

53:04.598 --> 53:05.932
-[Stuart] No?
-[Louise] No.

53:06.016 --> 53:09.561
It was just a careless moment.

53:13.064 --> 53:15.400
Do you think there's
gonna be like a comet tonight?

53:15.483 --> 53:16.818
Can you see one?

53:19.988 --> 53:21.698
[Stuart] Oh, I just saw a shooting star.

53:21.781 --> 53:22.991
[Louise] You did?

53:23.909 --> 53:26.578
[Stuart] Hmm, it's just a spaceship.

53:28.038 --> 53:33.543
[Louise] Well, um,
maybe you should paint one

53:34.044 --> 53:35.462
next time you do a painting,

53:35.545 --> 53:37.339
but just next to a KFC.

53:37.422 --> 53:39.633
[Stuart laughs] Okay.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.761
Okay, okay. I will.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.641
You know what, I always wanted
to have one of those, um...

53:48.350 --> 53:49.351
Those things.

53:49.434 --> 53:51.478
Like those long things
to look at the stars, you know.

53:51.561 --> 53:53.355
-How you call it?
-Telescope.

53:53.438 --> 53:55.607
-Yes, a telescope.
-Or elephant tusk.

53:55.690 --> 53:56.775
[Louise laughs]

53:56.858 --> 53:58.818
Or elephant tusk. Telescope.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.278
-Okay.
-You mean telescope.

54:00.362 --> 54:03.448
Yeah. It's on my list of, uh...

54:04.366 --> 54:07.869
"to do" things that I will...
will never do.

54:08.495 --> 54:09.663
Probably.

54:10.872 --> 54:13.166
Well, I would love to know

54:13.249 --> 54:16.002
the list of things
that maybe you have done.

54:17.170 --> 54:18.254
Hmm.

54:20.715 --> 54:23.551
Well, that sounds like a scary question.

54:24.344 --> 54:26.638
All right. Easy question.

54:26.721 --> 54:30.141
Uh... how long have you been here?
How did you get here?

54:31.601 --> 54:33.311
-Uh...
-Two questions.

54:34.938 --> 54:37.857
I'm from Paris, and I...

54:39.484 --> 54:41.653
I wanted to be an artist.

54:42.278 --> 54:45.699
And I've been here for a long time.

54:45.782 --> 54:47.492
Longer than I have thought...

54:49.995 --> 54:51.037
I would.

54:51.788 --> 54:52.998
[Stuart] Hmm.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.125
Um... [clears throat]

54:55.250 --> 54:56.334
...what about you?

54:57.293 --> 54:58.503
What's your story?

54:58.586 --> 55:01.715
Tell me about that girl.
The girl on the train.

55:02.507 --> 55:04.259
Careless moment.

55:05.218 --> 55:06.803
That's too easy.

55:07.429 --> 55:09.472
Uh, temporary insanity.

55:09.931 --> 55:11.141
Okay.

55:11.975 --> 55:13.101
Well...

55:15.478 --> 55:18.648
You seem to have a thing
for girls in trains, though.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.234
That is funny.

55:21.568 --> 55:22.736
-It's funny?
-I actually...

55:22.819 --> 55:25.405
I actually used to build
model trains as a kid.

55:25.947 --> 55:27.115
[Louise] Hmm.

55:27.490 --> 55:28.992
Maybe it's subconscious.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.452
Probably.

55:30.952 --> 55:33.872
Well, I actually used to eat sand

55:34.497 --> 55:36.583
on the playgrounds when I was kid.

55:37.584 --> 55:39.502
That sounds like an eating disorder.

55:39.836 --> 55:42.797
But does it mean that
I should be living on the beach?

55:43.339 --> 55:44.799
Um...

55:45.216 --> 55:47.177
-Did you know...
-Maybe it's subconscious.

55:47.677 --> 55:50.555
Did you know Kentucky
is right next to the ocean?

55:50.638 --> 55:52.057
-Is it?
-[Stuart] No, it's not.

55:52.140 --> 55:53.683
-[Louise] Really?
-No.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.561
Oh, well, I have no sense of geography.

55:57.604 --> 55:59.022
Do you mind?

56:16.039 --> 56:17.916
[Louise] Did you ever think that...

56:18.917 --> 56:22.128
Your cooking would get you into my bed?

56:24.005 --> 56:26.466
That was my plan all along.

56:30.095 --> 56:32.097
Actually, it was my plan.

56:36.434 --> 56:39.270
-But I'll let you believe it was yours.
-[chuckles]

56:43.358 --> 56:46.236
-You're full of surprises.
-Mmm-hmm.

56:47.445 --> 56:49.614
Mmm. Speaking of...

56:56.162 --> 56:57.497
[Stuart sighs]

56:57.580 --> 56:58.748
What?

56:59.457 --> 57:01.876
-I thought all French women smoked.
-[chuckles]

57:02.919 --> 57:04.546
That's such a cliché.

57:04.629 --> 57:05.839
I know.

57:06.047 --> 57:07.882
Okay. [clears throat]

57:08.800 --> 57:10.969
I'll do it. I'm gonna try
not to disappoint you,

57:11.052 --> 57:13.012
but I really suck at it.

57:13.263 --> 57:15.515
Just let me have my stereotype.

57:15.598 --> 57:17.559
-Okay.
-[both laugh]

57:24.441 --> 57:26.401
[coughing]

57:30.989 --> 57:32.282
It's really sexy when you smoke.

57:32.407 --> 57:33.950
[coughs] Thank you.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.293
[chuckles]

57:44.294 --> 57:45.962
Who do you think you are?

57:46.045 --> 57:47.630
Jean-Paul Belmondo?

57:49.215 --> 57:51.009
Are you trying to impress me?

57:51.759 --> 57:53.761
-Is it working?
-It is.

57:56.473 --> 57:57.599
[door opens]

58:00.477 --> 58:01.519
Hello.

58:04.189 --> 58:06.191
Ah, fuck!

58:06.608 --> 58:07.775
Door!

58:07.859 --> 58:09.903
[cellphone ringing]

58:11.696 --> 58:13.990
-[Stuart grunts] Sorry.
-[cellphone stops ringing]

58:17.619 --> 58:19.329
[chuckles]

58:26.461 --> 58:29.923
[Liam] Look at you,
wearing your big girl's blouse.

58:30.006 --> 58:31.799
Good luck trying to
work off that flabby gut

58:31.883 --> 58:33.218
scribbling on a clipboard.

58:33.301 --> 58:34.427
Good morning, Liam.

58:34.511 --> 58:37.180
That's not gonna do a damn thing
for your sorry knob either.

58:37.263 --> 58:39.140
Why are you always
talking about my genitals?

58:39.224 --> 58:42.185
[scoffs] Seriously, man.
Your withered little joint

58:42.268 --> 58:44.687
is the most pitiful thing I've ever seen.

58:45.271 --> 58:46.397
That's interesting.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.274
[in Scottish accent]
That's not what your mother said.

58:54.697 --> 58:57.534
[both grunting]

58:57.617 --> 58:59.661
Ahhh! You fucking scum!

58:59.953 --> 59:02.163
-[both grunting]
-[Stuart laughs]

59:21.641 --> 59:23.476
[Liam] Let me go, you fucking biter!

59:23.560 --> 59:25.645
Ooh! Oh!

59:33.736 --> 59:35.071
I had her first.

59:36.364 --> 59:37.532
Bullshit!

59:38.658 --> 59:41.119
I'm glad you lost
your fucking ring, you cunt!

59:42.453 --> 59:44.372
Come on back, you coward!

59:44.747 --> 59:46.499
Go fuck yourself!

59:48.042 --> 59:49.794
[gasping]

59:50.962 --> 59:53.464
-[clears throat] Are you in?
-[Sharron] Unfortunately.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.800
-This place is disgusting.
-[Stuart] Okay.

59:56.259 --> 59:58.970
By my desk, there should be
the box my microwave came in

59:59.053 --> 01:00:00.513
with some magazines on it.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.140
[Sharron] Yeah. Some magazines?

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:03.433
Right. [groans]

01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:05.018
Yeah. Dig in there.

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:07.437
Okay. Oh, my God, Stuart.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.189
-[objects clattering over phone]
-[Sharron] Oh!

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:12.483
-Oh, my God.
-[coughing]

01:00:13.484 --> 01:00:16.404
A 20-year-old bottle of Blanton's,
you son of a bitch?

01:00:16.487 --> 01:00:19.616
Okay. I need you to overnight
that case to Chez Max.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:22.535
-Uh, the address is--
-Just text me the address, Stuart.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.996
And please, tell me this is
gonna help you close this deal

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.497
and you're not just gonna drink it.

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:28.374
No, I'm not gonna drink it.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.086
[speaking French]

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:43.514
What happened to you?

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.974
It was all for love.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:47.769
Look, I wanna get my ring back.

01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:49.020
This is a stickup?

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:51.981
No, I, uh, wanna get it out of hock.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.232
S'il vous plait.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.567
And you're paying by check?

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.527
No. I wanna make a trade.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:57.820
-A trade?
-Yeah.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.822
But what item do you have to trade?

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:03.660
A full case of 20-year-old
Kentucky bourbon.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:05.244
That tells me nothing.

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:08.247
Have you ever heard of Blanton's?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.835
That would be, uh, 60 Euro.

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.588
Before, it was... [muttering]

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:21.719
This is much more
than the value of your love ring.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.889
You fool.

01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:27.058
But we have a deal.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:33.981
-[Stuart sighs]
-[box opens]

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.778
Should this package not arrive tomorrow,

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:41.948
my cousin Leo will be paying you a visit.

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:43.991
Pleasure doing business with you.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.120
If that's what you call it.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.497
Hmm. Excuse me.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.291
What is your life?

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.794
Why are you still here?

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.046
For your information,

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.382
I actually represent
a certain party in the States

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:02.427
that's looking to acquire vineyards
here in the Bordeaux region.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.178
-Do you?
-I do.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:07.807
Hmm. And you're looking to acquire what?

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:09.934
Chateau Beauregard.

01:02:10.017 --> 01:02:11.477
[chuckles]

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.313
That will never happen.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.565
[chuckles]

01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:18.735
The offer we are prepared
to make is more than reasonable.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.906
The one you must negotiate with is not.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:27.285
Actually, I found her
to be quite reasonable.

01:02:28.786 --> 01:02:30.747
I'm speaking about her husband.

01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:33.124
What?

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:37.044
Gerard. You've met him.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:42.508
And Gerard wants nothing,
and will take nothing.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:52.894
You and Gerard are married?

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:54.937
Oui.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.564
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:57.899
How would you not know?

01:02:57.982 --> 01:02:59.150
How could I know?

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:01.652
You two have never even spent
the night together in a room.

01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:05.782
-Can we talk about this later?
-Why?

01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:14.499
Uh... excusez-moi. Pardon me.

01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:16.209
Um, s'il vous plait, merci.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:19.754
Uh, please follow me,
I'm gonna show you the, um, vineyard

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:22.673
and the beautiful Pomerol landscape.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.178
Hello, Stuart.

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:31.599
God, you're like a...
like an in-grown hair.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:35.019
Just keep popping up, very irritating.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.437
Very embarrassing.

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:37.855
Nice...

01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:39.816
Stu, I mean, officially,

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.692
I'm supposed to be offended
by your behavior,

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.111
but, uh, I mean, if you and...
I mean, she's like--

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:45.404
Frank.

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.989
-[speaking French] Dépêchez-vous.
-I'm coming.

01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:52.954
What?

01:03:53.037 --> 01:03:55.248
Whoa! Take it easy, big fella.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:59.752
Look, mate, I'm, uh...
I'm taking off. All right?

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:04.215
You won her. Fair and square.
So, go get your ring back.

01:04:04.298 --> 01:04:06.384
Maybe you and Louise can settle down.

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:08.302
I got my ring back.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.847
I think I might just
work on myself for a while.

01:04:11.305 --> 01:04:12.640
Oh, good for you.

01:04:12.723 --> 01:04:14.517
No, I'm a big fan of self-improvement.

01:04:15.142 --> 01:04:16.269
You are?

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:17.478
Obviously.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.105
Do you think you can spare a few quid

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.857
so I don't end up like
a homeless person out there?

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.360
No. I barely have bus fare
and you still owe me for that dinner.

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:25.736
[clicks tongue]

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.238
You're not gonna let go
of that one, are you?

01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:28.447
No.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.409
All right, well, this is it then, mate.

01:04:31.492 --> 01:04:32.743
-All right?
-All right.

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.704
You stay in touch, you big, red bastard.

01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:36.956
-Good luck to you, Liam.
-We had an adventure, didn't we?

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.457
-Yeah.
-There were some good parts.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.418
-Yeah.
-Come on, you're not gonna forget me.

01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:41.544
Yeah, I won't.

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:44.797
You take care of yourself, Stuart.
You stay beautiful.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.132
Good luck to you, Liam.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:47.800
Don't need it!

01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:52.930
Ros!

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:00.646
I... I don't know,
I've just been thinking about...

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:05.735
It was really sweet
in its own absurd wrong way.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:07.778
Thanks.

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:10.907
You and I have always had
very open, honest conversations.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:14.118
And that day at the Eiffel Tower--

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:16.495
I know, French TSA is the worst.

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:19.415
I realized that it had
nothing to do with me.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:22.209
It was you risking our friendship

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:25.504
to realize an idealized version
of what your life could be.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.507
You're right.

01:05:29.383 --> 01:05:30.760
And I am sorry.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.304
-Okay?
-Okay.

01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:40.770
Do you think in like
a not-weird, not-proposal way,

01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:42.605
I can just, like, look at the ring?

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.482
Oh, the ring? You didn't get the sparkle.

01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:46.317
-I didn't get the sparkle.
-No.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:51.781
I don't have it. I just had it.

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:53.282
God damn it!

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:54.992
Look, it's cool.

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:00.706
Liam!

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.334
-[Tillie] Such a good talk. Oh!
-[Liam grunts]

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:04.961
[Frank] Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:06.420
[Liam] I lost my group back there.

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:08.255
I was hoping to get a ride back into town.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:12.009
Where are you from? I detect an accent.
Are you from the Isles?

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:14.011
-[Liam] Keen ear you have, yeah?
-It's probably...

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.554
It sounds like he's British to me.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.099
The accent and myself are from Scotland.

01:06:18.182 --> 01:06:19.558
Ah, that's what I was gonna say.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:22.353
What do you do in Scotland, hon?
Are you a pig farmer?

01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:24.188
Uh, close.

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:27.441
Uh, I used to be
a professional football player.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:30.569
Okay, now, just for the record,
I think what he means,

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:32.863
-is what we would think of as soccer--
-Frank, we know what he means.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.281
-He means soccer.
-All right.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:35.533
But you used to be. What happened?

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:37.743
Uh, well, I... I hurt my foot.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:41.455
And now, I'm just a regular guy
trying to put pieces back together.

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.499
Mmm. What kind of pieces?

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.502
Well, you're one
for the questions, aren't you?

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.421
Uh, well, if you must know,

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:53.009
I was recently spurned
by the love of my life.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.927
-Oh.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.638
[sighs] Yep. That happens.

01:06:57.763 --> 01:07:00.850
-That... that kind of stuff happens.
-[Liam] Yeah.

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:02.184
[Tillie] I just said that, Frank.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:03.686
[Rosalind] It happened, it has happened.

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:05.271
[Tillie] Who's got a Rolaids?

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.901
To answer your question, yes.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:13.946
I'm married.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.659
But it's complicated.

01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:20.619
I mean...

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.623
[sighs]

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:28.002
For some reason, my marriage
became something that isn't...

01:07:28.085 --> 01:07:30.254
That is not romantic anymore, and...

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:33.883
You know, I... I wasn't expecting
to meet someone on a train,

01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:36.385
and everything happened so fast, that...

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:40.848
I should have told you that...

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:48.481
In my mind, I'm not living
the life of a married woman, and...

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:52.443
Maybe that's why I didn't
feel the need to explain.

01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:01.368
Does that make any sense at all?

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:05.915
Not totally.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:08.751
But...

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:10.961
I'm okay.

01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:15.925
[Liam] She would have loved it here.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:17.801
Who are you talking about?

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:21.305
My girl. You know, my ex-girl.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.434
I had her out here in Paris,
between matches.

01:08:27.394 --> 01:08:29.020
I'm at a crossroads myself.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.898
-Aye?
-Yeah.

01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:33.274
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
-That's okay.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.569
Well, look.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.363
I still got the ring.

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:40.825
I paid seven grand for the thing.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:43.035
Which means it's probably only worth six.

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:46.831
But I bet we could get four,
four and a half for it.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:50.835
Enough for you and I to live a little.
Get away from the grown-ups.

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:54.462
You like?

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.466
Oh. Wow.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:08:59.926
This would be a nice present for Edie.

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:01.511
-You know, she--
-Hey, hey.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.140
Not again!

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.392
Sacrebleu!

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.227
I've been told I have impeccable taste.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.603
Yeah.

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:11.272
Hi, peanuts, what's happening?

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:13.439
This is my engagement ring.
It's the one from Stuart.

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:14.984
-What?
-[Tillie] From Stuart?

01:09:15.067 --> 01:09:18.404
What do you mean the one from Stuart?
Oh, that is Stuart's ring.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.197
Are you Rosie?

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.325
-Oh, fuck!
-[Rosalind] How did you get this?

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.161
Wait a minute.
Why do you have Stuart's ring?

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.246
[laughs nervously] He gave that to me.

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:30.791
No, no, no. Stuart is a dumbass,

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.417
but he would never give you this ring.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.794
All right, look. I took it.

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:35.587
-What is wrong with you?
-Okay. I took it.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.506
But there's a good reason.
All right. I was broke, and alone,

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:39.841
and I did not want to go home,

01:09:39.925 --> 01:09:42.344
and I met your beautiful daughter,

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:45.096
and I wanted to spend
everything I had on her.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:47.183
Well, of course you do,
look at her, she's gorgeous.

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.684
-She is.
-Now...

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:50.394
Call the police, Frank. Call the police.

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:51.895
-I'm calling the police.
-No, no, no.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:53.354
There's no need for police.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:56.483
Look. Look.
I'm sorry, all right? I really am.

01:09:57.484 --> 01:10:00.946
Been a bit broken, lately.
Been doing a lot of shitty things.

01:10:01.113 --> 01:10:02.114
Wow.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.490
Turns out I don't know
the number of the police.

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:06.452
What a great confession.
A real catch over here.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:08.078
Bet every woman just drops her panties

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:09.163
-at the sound of that.
-All right.

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:10.497
Sincere apology, ma'am.

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:12.708
Practice your French
on the chocolatier, I don't know.

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:14.251
Chocolatier. Let's go to the chocolatier.

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:15.669
Dad knows where one is.
Just take her, please.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:17.004
-[Frank] You two--
-You're good people.

01:10:17.087 --> 01:10:18.631
Don't you dare give him back that ring.

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:19.965
-You two have fun.
-I apologize.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.134
-It's a pretzel cut!
-Come on, come on. Please.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.094
Thank you for that.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.930
Let's go get lunch.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:27.306
Really?

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:29.266
I don't know.
I really think you're an idiot.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.936
But I don't know,
I like your accent, so let's go.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.938
-It's cool, isn't it?
-It's kind of cool.

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:35.773
I knew you and I had a connection.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.941
Do we?

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.192
-I think we do.
-Okay.

01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:41.403
Just full disclosure. Um, I have no money.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:42.696
So lunch is on you.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.240
I said, let me buy you lunch.

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:45.491
[Liam] Brilliant.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:52.915
[Stuart] Gerard?

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:55.834
Have you, uh, seen the lady of the house?

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.586
Uh, I mean your wife.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:01.173
Took off on her bike couple hours ago.

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.717
But I don't keep a tracking device on her.

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:05.177
[both chuckle]

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:07.221
I've noticed she's very independent.

01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:11.392
So... [sniffles, exhales]

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:12.643
Louise.

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:15.980
Louise.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:17.982
[exhales]

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:22.027
I care a great deal about her happiness.

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.531
She was very young
when I brought her here. She...

01:11:25.906 --> 01:11:27.116
She gave up a lot

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.661
for a dream that wasn't really hers.

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:35.791
Actually, I might be able
to help you with this.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:37.668
I don't know if Louise told you,

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:41.088
but my company distributes wine
throughout North America.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.674
She said you were in whiskey. [coughing]

01:11:43.757 --> 01:11:47.469
Primarily, yes, but we also own
many boutique vineyards like your own,

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:51.181
and I'm authorized to make
an offer on your vineyard.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.183
A substantial one,

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:57.855
and I would eventually
take over management and sales,

01:11:58.188 --> 01:12:00.149
and take all the work off your hands.

01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:04.194
Uh, and of course, Louise's.
She'd be free to paint, or...

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.697
Paint and...

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:10.284
I would guarantee
that your legacy is in good hands, sir.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:13.412
[clears throat]
It's an interesting proposition.

01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:16.665
[coughing] Have you
spoken to Louise about this?

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:17.833
[Stuart] No, I haven't.

01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:20.711
-Actually, earlier I was trying to find--
-[groaning and choking]

01:12:20.794 --> 01:12:21.920
Gerard?

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.340
Gerard?

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:26.759
You okay?

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:29.345
Gerard?

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:30.846
Gerard?

01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:33.098
Gerard?

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:35.225
Help!

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:37.770
Help!

01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:08.634
[Sharron] Where are we
on the Beauregard deal?

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:10.594
It's, uh...

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:12.721
Moving along.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.015
It's, uh... it's a unique process.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:17.476
Okay, Stuart, we're prepared
to make a real offer here.

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:20.270
So, if you have a timeline,
can you make the intro?

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:23.315
I spoke with the owner. And he was, uh...

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.067
They were open to selling the vineyard.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:26.652
He.

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:27.903
How close are you?

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:31.198
Look... I know... I don't know...

01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:34.952
I'm legitimately close
to buying the vineyard. Okay?

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:36.995
I just have a...

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.582
Just have one small issue
I have to deal with, and then...

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.168
Okay. So, you can make the introduction.

01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:47.881
Stuart, are you there?

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:54.263
What small issue
do you need to deal with? Me?

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.391
No. Louise, no. That's not--

01:13:57.474 --> 01:14:00.060
Did you somehow think
you could buy the vineyard in my back?

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:03.313
No. Absolutely not.
That's not true at all.

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.858
Look, I've been trying to find a time,

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.735
respectfully, to speak to you
about this, okay?

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:12.281
And I... I spoke with Gerard
before he passed, and I...

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.825
He was open to selling the vineyard.

01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:16.034
-Oh, really?
-Yes!

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.912
Like you and Gerard
decided on my life together?

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:22.040
No! Not at all.
We're talking about you selling something.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.584
We're not stealing it.

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:26.920
I'm talking about the best thing
that could possibly happen for you.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:29.882
I can take care of
everything that you hate.

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.676
You can spend time
with your painting, and your...

01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:34.261
You can enjoy your life.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.472
-I get it.
-Yes!

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:37.806
You're my hero.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:41.268
But where do I belong in this story, huh?

01:14:41.518 --> 01:14:43.854
Did you think that maybe
I wanted something else?

01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:45.814
Or maybe I can make my own decisions?

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.024
Of course I did.

01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:50.152
I should have told you upfront. Yes.

01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:54.364
-I don't want to lose this, okay?
-Huh!

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:58.660
Oh, really? Well, I don't blame you.
You can make tons of money.

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:00.829
What are you... No!

01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:02.873
I don't want to lose us.

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:07.169
But Stuart, you know what?

01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:09.588
We are nothing. We're nothing.

01:15:12.132 --> 01:15:14.676
You should just leave.
You should just get the fuck out of here.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.638
And take anything you want.
It's gonna be yours anyway.

01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:20.015
-Look--
-You know what? Congratulations.

01:15:20.098 --> 01:15:22.643
You got the fucking vineyard,
but not the girl.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.104
[door slams shut]

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.834
[knocking on door]

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:49.044
[Stuart] Louise.

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:52.297
Let me just work this out. Please.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:58.428
[man over PA] This is the final call
for American Airlines

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:01.056
Flight 238 to Louisville, Kentucky.

01:16:38.635 --> 01:16:43.515
Three-piece dark meat, uh,
mashed potatoes, corn on the cob.

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:45.851
[speaking French]

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.520
Uh... nothing.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:50.897
Thank you.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.155
[recorded message playing]
Hey, Louise, it's Stuart again.

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:02.909
Uh, I just want to let you know
I got some KFC tonight

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.453
and Kentucky misses you.

01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:06.246
And the Colonel misses you.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:10.042
And, uh, yeah, that's it.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:13.086
Um... call me.

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:41.740
Well, a thousand cases would be great.

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:46.870
-And, uh, how about I throw in 50 cases...
-Good job.

01:17:46.953 --> 01:17:48.121
...at cost?

01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:52.501
[chuckles]

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:54.670
Well then,
I guess I gotta fly down to Texas

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:57.214
and teach you how to
make an Old Fashioned.

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.055
[recorded message playing]
Hey, Louise, it's Stuart.

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:08.892
I called the chateau this time.
I thought you might pick up.

01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:13.313
You're... you're there
probably working, busy.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:16.441
Um... yeah, I was hoping you'd pick up.

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:20.195
Uh, it's been a week,
can you be... believe it,

01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:22.739
since I've been home. Uh...

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:26.368
Okay. Maybe I'll try you again later.

01:18:28.578 --> 01:18:31.373
-[laughing] Oh, boy.
-[commentary on TV]

01:18:31.456 --> 01:18:32.666
Look at these idiots.

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.919
Come on! You're a professional.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.296
[chuckles]

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:42.426
You okay?

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:44.219
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:45.387
[chuckles] They're not.

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:48.014
They're in trouble.
I think they're gonna lose.

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:08.326
[Louise] Is it... is it the sunset?
Or it's the... yeah.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.162
[Stuart] Mmm-mmm. It's a comet.

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:13.206
It's a celestial event.
I think it lands in the vineyard.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.791
It doesn't harm the chateau.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.543
[Louise laughs]

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.771
What are you doing here?

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:44.774
I thought I could go home,
but you're not there.

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:49.738
And I've never felt home...

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:54.576
Except when I was with you.

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.661
'Cause you...

01:21:57.412 --> 01:22:00.206
You care for life
like no one I've ever met.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:05.295
I told Sharron
she could take the offer herself.

01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:07.964
If you sell your vineyard,
she can have it all.

01:22:09.966 --> 01:22:11.051
I don't...

01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:13.136
I don't want something easy.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.221
I want you.

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:23.396
Can I sit down?

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.485
Yes.

01:22:40.997 --> 01:22:43.249
I guess I... I should tell you that I...

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:46.002
I... I accepted their offer
this morning.

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:49.130
I sold the vineyard.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:55.387
It's a shame. You could have
painted your own vineyard.

01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:59.808
It was never about the vineyard for me.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.978
Just the girl.

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.835
How much was it?

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.004
It wasn't in the box.
