08:30.955 --> 08:32.723
Oh, well, what is she doing?

08:32.723 --> 08:34.659
She's working

08:34.659 --> 08:36.027
at a job.

08:36.027 --> 08:38.729
And on herself.
Uh, any other thoughts?

08:38.729 --> 08:40.164
Anyone?
On the book?

08:40.164 --> 08:41.899
‐(doorbell rings)
‐Oh!

08:41.899 --> 08:42.934
Excuse me.

08:45.436 --> 08:47.838
(whispering):
I have so many thoughts.

08:50.708 --> 08:52.777
Hi.
Does Samantha Fink live here?

08:52.777 --> 08:54.879
Yes.
Who are you?

08:54.879 --> 08:57.215
Her probation officer.

08:57.215 --> 08:59.650
Here for
a residence verification.

08:59.650 --> 09:01.819
So, help me understand.

09:01.819 --> 09:04.322
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Uh, the state can just show up

09:04.322 --> 09:06.357
whenever they please?
You people don't think

09:06.357 --> 09:07.692
anyone's living a life?

09:08.726 --> 09:10.895
Ma'am, I got a lot of houses
to get to.

09:10.895 --> 09:12.363
Can I just see a gas bill?

09:14.899 --> 09:16.334
(whispering):
Okay. You can come in.

09:16.334 --> 09:18.102
‐I have guests.
‐Okay.

09:21.572 --> 09:24.942
Mm. That's nice.

09:24.942 --> 09:27.278
I got to pee, got to pee,
got to pee...

09:27.278 --> 09:28.980
Oh, hey. Hi!

09:28.980 --> 09:30.014
‐Hey.
‐I'm Bob.

09:30.014 --> 09:31.182
I'm Gail.

09:31.182 --> 09:33.084
‐Hi, Gail.
‐Just waiting for Ms. Fink.

09:33.084 --> 09:35.353
Oh, okay, well, we got a
book club going if you'd like

09:35.353 --> 09:37.455
‐to snag a snack while you wait.
‐Oh, my God, thank you...

09:37.455 --> 09:40.424
You... Actually,
she asked me to wait here,

09:40.424 --> 09:42.093
and I have a policy of not

09:42.093 --> 09:44.495
snooping around white folks'
house without their permission.

09:44.495 --> 09:46.964
(laughs)

09:46.964 --> 09:49.467
I have the same policy.

09:49.467 --> 09:50.601
But Carol would
be so upset if I was

09:50.601 --> 09:51.769
the only one
who ate these snacks.

09:51.769 --> 09:52.970
‐Come on in, come on in.
‐Oh.

09:52.970 --> 09:56.474
‐The cream puffs are to die for.
‐Oh, okay. Wait,

09:56.474 --> 09:59.143
‐now, do you have a Lactaid?
'Cause I'm‐a need it.
‐I can find you one.

09:59.143 --> 10:01.812
‐Thank you.
‐Everybody, this is Gail.

10:01.812 --> 10:03.114
ALL:
Hi.

10:03.114 --> 10:05.616
I'm just for the gas bill,
quick and painless.

10:05.616 --> 10:06.784
Well... there's a spot
right here.

10:06.784 --> 10:08.085
‐Come, sit down.
‐Welcome.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.954
‐Yeah, come.
‐Thank you.

10:09.954 --> 10:11.055
‐I'm gonna go to the bathr...
‐Can I speak to you

10:11.055 --> 10:12.356
‐in the kitchen for a minute?
‐Sure.

10:12.356 --> 10:13.591
GAIL:
I don't know
what I'm doing here,

10:13.591 --> 10:15.226
but I never turn down
a charcuterie.

10:15.226 --> 10:18.095
What are you doing?
That's Sam's probation officer.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.997
She's a delight.
She fits right in.

10:19.997 --> 10:22.500
I don't need
book club discussing

10:22.500 --> 10:26.337
Sam's weird relationship
with alcohol.

10:26.337 --> 10:29.640
If you're ever gonna discuss it,
this is the place.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.676
These are your friends.

10:31.676 --> 10:33.311
They're my book club.

10:34.812 --> 10:37.114
Okay, then, in that case,
why's it matter?

10:37.114 --> 10:40.785
I don't know.
I don't know.

10:40.785 --> 10:43.587
I just wanted to have a place

10:43.587 --> 10:47.091
where I could sit and talk
with smart people about books

10:47.091 --> 10:49.327
and take a little vacation
from thinking about Samantha

10:49.327 --> 10:51.529
all the time.

10:51.529 --> 10:54.699
All right.
I get that. I get it.

10:54.699 --> 10:56.834
Okay?
And you are not alone in this.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.202
All right?

10:58.202 --> 11:00.871
We're all far from perfect.

11:03.007 --> 11:04.041
Thank you.

11:05.209 --> 11:06.477
I really got to pee.

11:08.346 --> 11:09.914
(indistinct chatter)

11:09.914 --> 11:12.283
‐What do you want?
‐Listen, I'm try...

11:12.283 --> 11:13.951
I'm just... I'm really
trying to take this sobriety

11:13.951 --> 11:15.820
more seriously this time,
and I...

11:15.820 --> 11:17.955
I owe you an amends.

11:17.955 --> 11:20.925
Oh. Okay.

11:20.925 --> 11:22.460
Uh, okay, yeah, right now.
Here we go.

11:22.460 --> 11:25.296
Uh, right. So...

11:25.296 --> 11:26.664
so, you were there, uh,

11:26.664 --> 11:28.366
when I couldn't be,
when my dad was sick,

11:28.366 --> 11:30.301
and I‐I really appreciate that.

11:31.402 --> 11:33.704
Yeah, no problem.

11:33.704 --> 11:34.705
I was happy to help.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.208
And, um...

11:38.342 --> 11:40.111
...also, New York.
New York.

11:40.111 --> 11:42.179
I‐I'm so sorry
that I ghosted you

11:42.179 --> 11:43.414
when you came to visit me
in New York.

11:43.414 --> 11:45.816
That was so messed‐up.
I mean...

11:45.816 --> 11:48.018
But, to be fair,
you were dating my ex

11:48.018 --> 11:49.687
and treating me like shit
at the time, and...

11:49.687 --> 11:51.589
Anyway, uh...

11:51.589 --> 11:52.857
Oh, speaking of that.
I'm really sorry

11:52.857 --> 11:54.225
about all those texts
that I sent you

11:54.225 --> 11:55.893
when I found out about you guys.

11:55.893 --> 11:57.261
It was, like,
way too aggressive.

11:57.261 --> 11:58.863
And, you know, women shouldn't

11:58.863 --> 12:00.264
go after other women and
just leave the guy out of it,

12:00.264 --> 12:04.101
but you were my best friend,
so that was like,

12:04.101 --> 12:07.905
"Is she serious?"
Uh... anyway, uh,

12:07.905 --> 12:10.441
also really sorry
about that time

12:10.441 --> 12:13.444
I puked on all the coats
and the bags at that party

12:13.444 --> 12:14.545
‐and then blamed it on you,
‐On me.

12:14.545 --> 12:17.648
‐but...
‐But, but, right. Um, Sam...

12:17.648 --> 12:19.683
Sorry, I'm just... I'm, like,
really trying to apologize.

12:19.683 --> 12:21.986
Yeah, but this‐this
isn't an apology.

12:21.986 --> 12:24.488
Apologies don't have "buts."
Sam, I just...

12:24.488 --> 12:26.490
I really needed today.
I have worked

12:26.490 --> 12:28.993
72 hours straight.

12:28.993 --> 12:32.463
I've pulled 38 items
out of body crevices.

12:32.463 --> 12:36.233
I am always covered
in bodily fluid. I...

12:36.233 --> 12:39.136
‐Ugh. That's what you do?
‐Oh, my God!

12:39.136 --> 12:41.806
Sam!
You never listen to me.

12:41.806 --> 12:44.241
Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.
Can we j‐can we just start over?

12:44.241 --> 12:45.910
Why? Why do you care
if I forgive you?

12:45.910 --> 12:47.611
I don't know.
It feels...

12:47.611 --> 12:48.913
important.

12:48.913 --> 12:50.915
What the hell?

12:50.915 --> 12:52.149
Is Brit bothering you again?

12:52.149 --> 12:53.584
‐What'd you say to her?
‐Oh, my God,

12:53.584 --> 12:55.286
Felicia, stop
with the mafia act.

12:55.286 --> 12:56.954
Wait, where's my kid?

12:56.954 --> 12:58.122
Oh, he's with Joel.
I just...

12:58.122 --> 12:59.490
I needed to talk to her
for a second.

12:59.490 --> 13:01.225
‐Why?
‐It's my birthday.

13:01.225 --> 13:02.960
Mm, you would be a Pisces.

13:05.496 --> 13:07.531
Oh, so that's the reason
you dragged us here.

13:07.531 --> 13:09.333
‐No, uh, that's not
the only reason...
‐No, you didn't

13:09.333 --> 13:11.735
want to hang out with me
and Zack, you just needed a ride

13:11.735 --> 13:13.337
because you can't drive a car
and you threw up

13:13.337 --> 13:16.240
in so many Lyfts that
you have a 1.8 rating. (scoffs)

13:16.240 --> 13:17.775
You made me drive all the way
to Roller Land so you could

13:17.775 --> 13:19.477
chat with the girl
who's marrying your ex.

13:19.477 --> 13:21.912
‐(scoffs) I'm done.
Honestly, Sam.
‐Felicia.

13:21.912 --> 13:24.448
‐Zack. Zack!
‐Okay.

13:24.448 --> 13:27.651
I waited 25 minutes in line
to get you a corn dog

13:27.651 --> 13:29.954
with no condiments, just like
you like it, you weirdo.

13:31.889 --> 13:33.224
And he's wearing blades!

13:33.224 --> 13:35.059
‐What the hell
is wrong with you?
‐W...

13:35.059 --> 13:37.428
‐FELICIA: Come on, baby.
‐No, no, no, Joel made him
wear the blades.

13:37.428 --> 13:40.531
‐Okay. Felicia.
‐FELICIA: Got it?

13:40.531 --> 13:42.466
Felicia, you can't just
leave me here.

13:42.466 --> 13:44.134
Oh, like how you left my kid?

13:44.134 --> 13:46.070
Come on, Zack, we'll get you
some ice cream, okay?

13:46.070 --> 13:47.371
(door closes)

13:48.405 --> 13:50.574
You know what?
People told me this

13:50.574 --> 13:52.476
‐and I didn't want to
believe it.
‐Believe what?

13:52.476 --> 13:53.744
That you just see me
as your drinking buddy.

13:54.812 --> 13:57.548
Okay, no. (scoffs)

13:58.616 --> 13:59.817
But, I mean,
it's a little true, right?

13:59.817 --> 14:00.851
'Cause, like, the only place
we ever hung out

14:00.851 --> 14:01.886
was Good Time Sally's.

14:01.886 --> 14:04.188
Because it was your suggestion.

14:04.188 --> 14:05.956
Okay?
I'm a full‐time mom.

14:05.956 --> 14:07.858
And a full‐time employee.
I got real‐life shit on my mind.

14:07.858 --> 14:09.627
So when you name a place,
I got to

14:09.627 --> 14:11.228
get a sitter, I got to
move a bunch of shit around,

14:11.228 --> 14:12.730
but I do that because it's you.

14:12.730 --> 14:15.299
And I appreciate that, okay?
Why don't we go inside and talk?

14:15.299 --> 14:16.967
‐He left his shoes.
‐You know, I would just love

14:16.967 --> 14:20.337
to just, like, rip my bra off
and sit on the couch

14:20.337 --> 14:21.472
and watch some mindless TV
with you.

14:21.472 --> 14:22.973
That would be so wonderful.

14:22.973 --> 14:24.708
There's, like,
seven seasons of Summer House

14:24.708 --> 14:25.976
we could binge, but no‐‐

14:25.976 --> 14:26.977
you don't want to do that
because you don't know

14:26.977 --> 14:28.679
how to be an actual friend.

14:28.679 --> 14:30.781
(door opens)

14:31.715 --> 14:33.784
(engine starts)

14:33.784 --> 14:35.286
FELICIA:
Buckle up, Zack.

14:35.286 --> 14:37.621
‐Oh, come on.
‐Auntie Sammy needs a time‐out.

14:37.621 --> 14:40.891
Uh, Felicia... I'm sorry, okay?
Wha...

14:40.891 --> 14:43.661
What am I supposed to do now?

14:44.695 --> 14:46.230
♪ Someday ♪

14:48.265 --> 14:49.934
♪ You may ♪

14:51.368 --> 14:53.270
♪ Forget me ♪

14:55.205 --> 14:57.775
♪ Well, that's okay with me. ♪

15:03.560 --> 15:05.740
‐(laughing)
‐Oh. Okay, I'm sorry, I have
overstayed my welcome.

15:05.740 --> 15:07.709
I actually wasn't planning
on staying this long.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.544
NOREEN:
It was nice to meet you, Gail.

15:09.544 --> 15:10.779
How do you know Carol again?

15:10.779 --> 15:12.313
Oh, we know each other
from work.

15:12.313 --> 15:15.383
Actually, Gail knows Samantha.

15:15.383 --> 15:17.218
CAROL:
Right. Sam

15:17.218 --> 15:18.553
was in New York,

15:18.553 --> 15:22.490
and she moved into digital,
and... you know,

15:22.490 --> 15:25.160
because you can do that
from... from anywhere.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.294
‐So...
‐What does digital mean?

15:26.294 --> 15:28.229
Like, how does that work?

15:28.229 --> 15:29.731
Digital.

15:29.731 --> 15:30.732
What does that mean?

15:30.732 --> 15:32.500
It's...

15:32.500 --> 15:34.402
Digital.
It's online, it's computers.

15:34.402 --> 15:36.070
It's just...
How do you not know that?

15:40.074 --> 15:42.610
Samantha broke the law.
She's a felon.

15:42.610 --> 15:44.379
My daughter is a felon.

15:44.379 --> 15:46.414
Gail is her probation officer.

15:46.414 --> 15:48.249
‐What?
‐CAROL: Are you all happy now?

15:48.249 --> 15:49.818
‐No.
‐Not really.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.853
That felt so good
to say out loud.

15:51.853 --> 15:54.489
Oh, yeah, girl.
The truth'll set you free.

15:54.489 --> 15:56.491
‐(exhales)
‐BOB: C‐Can you share with us

15:56.491 --> 15:58.159
what‐what's coming up for you?

15:58.159 --> 16:01.229
I'm‐I'm... There's just
something bubbling up.

16:01.229 --> 16:02.730
Something... I...

16:02.730 --> 16:05.166
‐I feel like I want to die.
‐ALL: No.

16:05.166 --> 16:07.168
Well, I mean, I'm not an expert,

16:07.168 --> 16:09.470
but I'm pretty sure
you're feeling anger.

16:09.470 --> 16:10.772
CAROL:
You know what? I...

16:10.772 --> 16:12.340
I think it's anger.

16:13.508 --> 16:15.276
I think maybe it's anger.

16:15.276 --> 16:18.346
I think maybe I'm full of rage!

16:18.346 --> 16:19.981
‐(screaming)
‐(all clamoring)

16:19.981 --> 16:21.249
(Carol exhales)

16:21.249 --> 16:23.184
Hmm.

16:23.184 --> 16:25.086
That felt good.
(laughs)

16:28.790 --> 16:30.458
Thank you for sharing with us.

16:30.458 --> 16:33.127
It really meant a lot.
Right, guys?

16:33.127 --> 16:35.730
Sorry that you're
going through so much.

16:35.730 --> 16:38.233
Good for you, Carol.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.734
You're walking in your truth.

16:39.734 --> 16:41.803
I am.

16:41.803 --> 16:43.304
‐Very good.
‐(whooping)

16:46.541 --> 16:48.776
Barbara... Oh.

16:48.776 --> 16:50.478
Just kidding. (chuckles)
Terrible joke.

16:50.478 --> 16:52.313
(low whoops)

16:59.854 --> 17:02.423
You should be proud of yourself.

17:02.423 --> 17:04.192
Yeah.

17:04.192 --> 17:06.227
It feels bad and good
at the same time.

17:06.227 --> 17:07.962
Oh, that means it's working.

17:07.962 --> 17:09.764
