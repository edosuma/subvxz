[laughs]

19:19.024 --> 19:20.392
Nice try there, crumbs.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.461
The old Harvey
would have cleaned you up,

19:22.528 --> 19:25.564
but Rebel Harvey
doesn't even care.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.701
Okay, just quickly tidy up,
and no one will even notice.

19:29.768 --> 19:30.936
[gasps]

19:31.003 --> 19:33.805
Who put this down
without using a coaster?

19:33.872 --> 19:34.940
This is good wood.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.475
Oh. Oh, no.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.843
[groans]

19:37.910 --> 19:40.279
Okay, I'll just clean this up
real quick,

19:40.345 --> 19:42.214
then it's back to being a rebel.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.083
[grunting]

19:45.150 --> 19:46.518
[laughs]

19:46.585 --> 19:48.053
You're getting the recycling

19:48.120 --> 19:49.788
mixed up
with the perishables!

19:55.294 --> 19:56.929
[gasps]

19:56.995 --> 20:01.900
Somebody messed up
these library books!

20:01.967 --> 20:03.335
Aah!

20:03.402 --> 20:05.003
Irving, it's working.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.573
Aah!
My garden!

20:07.639 --> 20:09.808
What kind of monsters
would do this?

20:09.875 --> 20:10.809
Aah!

20:10.876 --> 20:12.110
I knew it was you two.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.445
Shut up, Dade.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.680
{\an1}We had a good reason
this time.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.448
{\an1}See? We're trying
to fix Harvey.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.617
Everything goes in the place
it's supposed to go.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.352
That's the fella I know.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.621
Fight it,
you beautiful dandelion.

20:22.688 --> 20:23.855
{\an3}[grunting]

20:23.922 --> 20:25.457
{\an3}Aah!

20:25.524 --> 20:28.727
I should just leave this messy,
but I want to make it beautiful.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.863
{\an3}[laughs]

20:31.930 --> 20:35.467
I got to fold laundry,
or the clothes will get wrinkly.

20:35.534 --> 20:38.370
Wait a second. Who added laundry
to the obstacle course?

20:38.437 --> 20:39.805
Obstacle course?

20:39.871 --> 20:42.808
Oh, I thought Harvey
was doing chores for free.

20:42.874 --> 20:45.611
[grunting]

20:45.677 --> 20:47.012
Ooh!

20:47.079 --> 20:50.582
It's okay, sweetie.
We're here to help.

20:50.649 --> 20:51.950
I'm fine!
Everything's fine!

20:52.017 --> 20:55.220
I want to clean my room so much,
but it hurts!

20:55.287 --> 20:56.588
Don't fight it, Harvey.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.323
No!
Stay away from me!

20:58.390 --> 21:01.893
I can't protect you
from myself! Aah!

21:01.960 --> 21:03.762
Shower him in love.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.230
Let me in.

21:05.297 --> 21:09.568
Aah!

21:09.635 --> 21:11.436
Oh.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.705
Wait.
I'm free.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.574
I'm free!

21:15.641 --> 21:17.943
I'm sorry, Mom.
I let you down.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.446
{\an3}No, sweetie, you could
never let us down.

21:21.513 --> 21:22.814
{\an1}A shirt doesn't make you
who you are.

21:22.881 --> 21:25.417
{\an1}It's what's inside
the shirt that counts.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.853
Oh, right,
my nipples.

21:27.919 --> 21:31.590
I don't want to be boxed in
by labels anyway.

21:31.657 --> 21:34.660
Oh, man, do you know
what I want to do so bad?

21:34.726 --> 21:36.795
I want to fix that brick.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.731
You do whatever
makes you happy.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.932
Yeah!

21:40.999 --> 21:41.933
I love this!

21:42.000 --> 21:43.568
Aw, sweetie,

21:43.635 --> 21:47.572
you're my little, um,
complicated person.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.974
Now I want to iron
all my slacks,

21:49.041 --> 21:50.776
and then I want to clean
under the fridge,

21:50.842 --> 21:52.644
because it's super filthy
under there.

21:52.711 --> 21:54.146
{\an1}Yay!
Harvey's crazy!

21:54.212 --> 21:56.248
And then I'm gonna polish
all the furniture,

21:56.314 --> 21:57.783
every last bit
of furniture!

21:57.849 --> 22:00.852
{\an5}(Fee)
Okay, dude, we get it.
We get it.
