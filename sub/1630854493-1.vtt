WEBVTT

00:07.166 --> 00:09.533
All right.
You ready for this?

00:09.567 --> 00:11.500
This is the most
nervous I've been

00:12.667 --> 00:14.900
in probably 20 years.

00:14.934 --> 00:17.166
I am about to do
the craziest thing

00:17.200 --> 00:20.200
I've done
in a very, very long time.

00:20.233 --> 00:23.433
Trying to take
a Florida airboat

00:23.467 --> 00:26.400
up the Tsirku
which is a crazy river.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.100
Well, everybody says
it can't be done.

00:29.133 --> 00:32.233
And if anybody's gonna do it,
we're the ones to do it.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.367
I've been told
by all the locals,

00:36.400 --> 00:37.767
"Don't do this.
You're gonna die."

00:37.800 --> 00:38.934
Here we go!

00:38.967 --> 00:40.200
Yeah, it's off the trailer.

00:40.233 --> 00:41.800
This actually scares me.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.500
Heart's up in my throat
right now.

00:47.634 --> 00:49.333
This season,
we have to go further

00:49.367 --> 00:50.867
than we've ever gone before.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.567
We're looking for
bigger and better gold.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.033
You don't want seatbelts
in these things

00:54.066 --> 00:55.834
because if they flip,
you wanna jump

00:55.867 --> 00:57.433
as far as you can away

00:57.467 --> 00:58.867
from this thing
and get to shore.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.934
We have to push ourselves

01:00.967 --> 01:02.734
like we've never pushed
ourselves before.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.333
We will achieve
the impossible.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.433
Mission control,
we are go for launch.

01:08.066 --> 01:08.934
Ready?

01:08.967 --> 01:10.033
Clear.

01:10.066 --> 01:12.900
If we're gonna die,
might as well die having fun.

01:16.834 --> 01:17.834
Ready.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.033
Rock 'n' roll.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.767
- Woo!

01:45.166 --> 01:46.900
Woo!

01:46.934 --> 01:48.000
Here we go.

01:48.033 --> 01:49.533
This is gonna be crazy.

01:50.133 --> 01:51.400
I love my job!

01:52.000 --> 01:53.567
Woo-hoo!

01:53.600 --> 01:55.200
On the all-new season...

01:55.233 --> 01:56.667
I bought a new claim.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.867
Bigger, better gold.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.300
- Dustin!
- What?

01:59.333 --> 02:01.433
- I got some gold, man!
- Yeah!

02:01.467 --> 02:02.734
of White Water.

02:02.767 --> 02:04.867
Rock, rock,
rock, rock, rock, rock.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.166
Two rules out here.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.300
Don't get hurt. Don't die.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.600
- Ugh. [bleep].
- You can't put this on TV.

02:10.634 --> 02:12.900
Dustin risks everything.

02:12.934 --> 02:14.634
Good gold
but nobody can get to it.

02:14.667 --> 02:15.934
What have you
gotten yourself into?

02:15.967 --> 02:18.200
On a remote new claim.

02:19.066 --> 02:20.467
Woo-hoo!

02:20.500 --> 02:22.800
Named for its monster gold.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.700
Nugget Creek
is like McKinley on steroids.

02:25.734 --> 02:28.767
And located deep
in the Alaskan wilderness.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.667
There's a bear!

02:30.533 --> 02:32.266
- Anybody nervous?
- This is scary.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.667
No machine
is gonna make it up there.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.033
I mean, it's not impossible.

02:35.066 --> 02:37.000
I have to find
an alternative way

02:37.033 --> 02:39.033
to get to the claim.

02:39.066 --> 02:40.700
Kamikaze, dude.

02:40.734 --> 02:42.033
New challenges.

02:42.066 --> 02:44.166
Our gold
is underneath that snow!

02:44.200 --> 02:45.333
Whoa!

02:45.367 --> 02:46.900
Just like the old-timers,
you gotta get something there,

02:46.934 --> 02:48.333
you put it on your
back and go.

02:48.367 --> 02:49.533
It's not safe.

02:49.567 --> 02:50.600
We need
to get out of here.

02:50.634 --> 02:52.333
It's a new level
of hard.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.233
up?

02:54.266 --> 02:55.634
Fire in the hole!

02:57.634 --> 02:59.033
Whoa! I just need a medic.

02:59.066 --> 03:00.467
New ground.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.000
All that experience
in the past

03:02.033 --> 03:03.900
is gonna come
to bear right now.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.367
And new hope...

03:05.400 --> 03:07.133
It's a new adventure.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.467
for a life-changing
pile of gold.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.433
.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.066
Right now, I'm
looking to change our lives.

03:33.100 --> 03:36.100
It could be the best thing
I've ever done

03:36.133 --> 03:38.300
or the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.467
Either way,
I'm looking for a big change.

03:43.133 --> 03:44.900
In Southeast Alaska,

03:44.934 --> 03:47.600
at the start
of a new mining season,

03:49.166 --> 03:51.800
Dustin Hurt gathers
his top lieutenants.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.200
- Hey, how's it going y'all?
- Hi.

03:55.233 --> 03:57.133
Hey, Dustin.
What's going on, brother?

03:57.166 --> 03:58.800
How's it going?

03:58.834 --> 03:59.867
Rough winter, dude.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.433
Let's get back to work.

04:02.467 --> 04:05.500
So, a few things
didn't work out

04:05.533 --> 04:06.900
the way I wanted it to.

04:06.934 --> 04:09.266
Uh, first of all, Valdez,

04:09.300 --> 04:11.767
that claim didn't work out.

04:12.967 --> 04:15.133
At the tail-end
of last season...

04:15.166 --> 04:17.367
Valdez, we made it, guys.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.900
Dustin found a new claim...

04:19.934 --> 04:22.166
Most people
would think it's difficult

04:22.200 --> 04:24.200
- but we're crazy.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.834
that proved to be gold-rich.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.133
I got gold already.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.033
That damn piece of gold.

04:30.066 --> 04:31.867
Dustin was
banking on this claim

04:31.900 --> 04:33.634
to be his future.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.533
This place, it's better
than anything I've ever dug.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.800
Woo!

04:38.834 --> 04:40.634
They got a lot of snow
this year.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.400
There's avalanche problems.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.066
By the time we start digging,

04:44.100 --> 04:46.533
it would be
the shortest season

04:47.033 --> 04:48.600
we've ever had.

04:48.634 --> 04:51.166
So, I can't
send anybody up there.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.700
We'll just double team
McKinley then, man.

04:53.734 --> 04:55.100
Carlos, I don't think
we're gonna go back

04:55.133 --> 04:55.934
to McKinley this year.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.700
Oh, bro.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.934
There it is, Fred.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.300
Six years ago...

05:03.834 --> 05:05.800
Hot damn.

05:05.834 --> 05:09.266
Dustin made the
greatest gamble of his life

05:09.300 --> 05:11.433
buying the McKinley
Creek claims.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.233
A pocket of gold on
this creek could be anywhere

05:15.266 --> 05:17.200
from 1 million
to 4 million bucks,

05:17.233 --> 05:19.367
I think, it's gonna make you
a wealthy man.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.900
Taking big risks...

05:20.934 --> 05:23.567
It's extremely
dangerous stuff.

05:24.900 --> 05:25.734
Yeah!

05:25.767 --> 05:26.700
Hit it!

05:26.734 --> 05:27.734
- One!
- One!

05:27.767 --> 05:29.133
Fire in the hole!

05:29.166 --> 05:32.033
-  Woo-hoo!

05:32.066 --> 05:35.533
He accessed areas
others didn't dare to mine.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
We're good.

05:37.233 --> 05:39.033
Carlos, you're gonna have to
pull from there

05:39.066 --> 05:40.433
and walk it over.

05:40.467 --> 05:43.333
With his father
and crew by his side.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.834
Whoa, whoa, watch out.

05:44.867 --> 05:46.100
Dustin risked life...

05:46.734 --> 05:48.734
Run! Run! Whoa!

05:49.433 --> 05:50.667
and limb...

05:52.567 --> 05:53.367
All right.

05:54.233 --> 05:55.533
to make them all rich.

05:56.634 --> 05:57.600
Holy [bleep].

05:57.634 --> 05:59.533
There's
nuggets everywhere.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.333
But for all their efforts...

06:02.367 --> 06:03.767
Twenty-five ounces.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.967
it never delivered

06:05.000 --> 06:06.400
the millions they wanted.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.000
Whoa.

06:08.033 --> 06:09.967
That looks like
more than 27 ounces.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Doesn't it?

06:11.033 --> 06:12.200
.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.400
I'm a little disappointed.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.467
McKinley has been picked
over better than I thought.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.900
Those old-timers
are a lot tougher

06:21.934 --> 06:23.333
than people give them
credit for.

06:23.367 --> 06:24.700
Some of those areas
that I have

06:24.734 --> 06:26.700
just never thought
they'd get to.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.033
I get that, man,
but it paid the bills.

06:29.066 --> 06:31.667
Well, I'm not doing this
to just pay the bills.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.500
- I'm trying to up the ante on this.
-  Sure.

06:33.533 --> 06:36.567
So, I'm trying to go bigger.
Well, just trust me on this.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.967
I'm trying to change our
whole damn lives right now.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.700
I've got a few leads.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.533
I think... I think
I can pull this off.

06:43.567 --> 06:46.367
It's kind of hard to just
follow someone on blind faith.

06:46.400 --> 06:50.033
Uh, I'll figure this out.

06:50.066 --> 06:51.700
I need you to trust me.

06:51.734 --> 06:53.367
We need to figure it out
pretty quickly

06:53.400 --> 06:55.100
'cause the season's
about to start.

06:55.133 --> 06:56.834
Do what you gotta do, bro.

06:56.867 --> 06:58.166
All right.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.133
I'm going out on a limb here

07:11.166 --> 07:14.266
to better our season
for the...

07:14.300 --> 07:16.800
for the biggest
and best gold that I can get.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.467
I'm sick of just making it.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.333
It's time to find
some real gold.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.667
Dustin's first stop...

07:30.367 --> 07:31.634
Hello?

07:31.667 --> 07:32.900
Hey, how you been, man?

07:32.934 --> 07:35.266
- I'm good.
- Welcome. Welcome.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.467
Do you want a cup of coffee?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.967
That sounds great.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.900
friend
and local mining legend,

07:39.934 --> 07:41.166
Mark Sebens.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.700
Okay.

07:42.734 --> 07:44.100
I wanted to
talk with you anyway

07:44.133 --> 07:45.634
'cause I've got something.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.700
So, I've been
digging this hole

07:47.734 --> 07:49.900
underneath
where the old flume was.

07:49.934 --> 07:51.734
Actually, let me show you
a couple of pictures here.

07:51.767 --> 07:53.266
- Okay.
- Um,

07:54.166 --> 07:55.600
so, here's the flume, right?

07:55.634 --> 07:58.667
And the creek
is running over here.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.100
You can see
the pile of tailings.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.533
- Look at that.
-  Oh, man.

08:01.567 --> 08:03.500
How fun would that be?

08:03.533 --> 08:07.767
Mark owns a claim
where a hundred years ago

08:07.800 --> 08:12.533
miners built a huge flume
to divert Porcupine Creek

08:12.567 --> 08:16.333
and mine the riverbed for
thousands of ounces of gold.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.333
Mark's theory,
the remains of the pilings

08:23.367 --> 08:26.100
that supported the flume
proved that the ground

08:26.133 --> 08:28.900
by the side of the creek
was never mined

08:28.934 --> 08:32.066
leaving behind
a bonanza in gold.

08:33.367 --> 08:36.734
So, these are just a couple
of the chunks from last year.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.266
Whoa.
Some good-looking stuff.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.767
I don't know
if this is something

08:40.800 --> 08:42.467
that'd work for you
and your crew. Um...

08:42.500 --> 08:44.734
Well,
it's not our normal digging.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.333
I'm definitely looking
for something

08:46.367 --> 08:47.967
that hasn't been picked
over with.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.700
What I'm actually looking for

08:49.734 --> 08:54.600
is, like, like, a long-term
kind of investment.

08:54.634 --> 08:58.000
Like, I'm looking
for something big,

08:58.033 --> 09:00.233
dangerous,
and possible to get to.

09:00.266 --> 09:01.934
These are the words
people have to use.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.533
Obviously, lots of gold, yeah,

09:03.567 --> 09:05.367
I know you know all the miners
around here.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.900
And I know you got
a lot of history here.

09:06.934 --> 09:08.900
So, I'm just curious
if you know anybody

09:08.934 --> 09:11.133
that's got something
that would line up.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.433
Do you know Al Gilliam?

09:15.333 --> 09:16.700
The guide?

09:16.734 --> 09:17.900
Yeah,
he's a hunting guide.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.333
Hunting guide.

09:19.367 --> 09:22.767
I know that
he ended up with claims

09:22.800 --> 09:25.233
and they're up
the Tsirku River,

09:25.266 --> 09:28.467
uh, at a place
called Nugget Creek.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.567
I mean, Al went up there
with a dredge.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.867
And they were only in there
for a couple of weeks.

09:33.900 --> 09:38.433
And showing some
really nice gold but...

09:38.467 --> 09:39.934
Is it really hard to get to?

09:39.967 --> 09:42.467
It's [bleep] hard to get to.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.133
Far from the nearest town

09:47.166 --> 09:49.400
and nine miles up
the Tsirku River

09:50.133 --> 09:51.600
lies Nugget Creek.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.533
First staked in 1899,

09:56.567 --> 09:59.767
rumor has it that the claim
was barely mined

09:59.800 --> 10:01.634
by the handful of old-timers

10:01.667 --> 10:02.834
who could get there.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.500
In the 1980s,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.066
a small group of prospectors

10:09.100 --> 10:11.433
mined the claim
for a few seasons.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.033
Despite finding
monster nuggets,

10:18.567 --> 10:19.867
they were forced out

10:19.900 --> 10:21.100
by the unforgiving

10:21.133 --> 10:22.734
and deadly wilderness.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.266
That sounds great.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.500
I'd love to talk to the guy

10:26.533 --> 10:27.900
to see if he's willing
to sell.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.266
- Give Al a call.
- Awesome, man.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.200
-  All right, man.
- All right.

10:31.233 --> 10:32.667
Hey, Dustin.
Great to see you again, bud.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.500
Yeah.

10:44.233 --> 10:45.467
I don't really like

10:45.500 --> 10:47.433
this last-minute
planning stuff.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.333
We should've already had
a plan locked down

10:49.367 --> 10:51.834
and a place locked down
before the season started.

10:51.867 --> 10:54.033
Not as the season's starting.

10:54.066 --> 10:57.066
After putting
in a call to the claim owner,

10:57.100 --> 10:59.400
Dustin brings in
Kayla Johanson

10:59.433 --> 11:01.033
to help him scout the claim.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.767
How's it going?

11:05.800 --> 11:08.033
She's an expert
at reading the land

11:08.066 --> 11:11.433
and spotting the signs
of hidden deposits of gold.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.667
So, there's four claims

11:15.700 --> 11:17.533
that I'd like to go
look at right now.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.000
They're over the top
of the mountains,

11:19.033 --> 11:20.834
zero access,
middle of nowhere.

11:20.867 --> 11:22.033
That's pretty steep.

11:22.066 --> 11:23.667
Yeah, it does look steep

11:23.700 --> 11:26.634
but I'm told
there's good gold in it.

11:26.667 --> 11:29.467
And it hasn't been hit
as hard as McKinley.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.967
Well, hopefully
it lives up to its name.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.467
- Yeah.
- Hi guys.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.266
- Hey.
- How's it going, man?

11:34.300 --> 11:36.000
- Good.
- Ready for a ride?

11:39.567 --> 11:41.133
All right.
Everybody hear me okay?

11:41.166 --> 11:42.934
- I got you.
-  All right.

11:42.967 --> 11:44.000
Coming up.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.367
Kayla,
how you liking the flight?

11:50.066 --> 11:51.266
It's a little weird.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.000
I've only been in planes.

11:53.033 --> 11:54.800
Is this your first
time in a helicopter?

11:54.834 --> 11:56.867
-  I'll be damned.

11:58.233 --> 11:59.934
Right up here is McKinley.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.900
So far,
Dustin's treasure hunt

12:03.934 --> 12:06.367
has lead him up Porcupine, McKinley,

12:06.400 --> 12:07.834
and Cahoon Creeks

12:08.433 --> 12:10.667
which over a century

12:10.700 --> 12:14.467
produced $145 million
in gold.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.900
His new prospect
shares the same mother lode.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.934
And gold could've been
washing down the mountains

12:22.967 --> 12:24.500
for thousands of years.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.900
It's so remote.

12:31.934 --> 12:35.533
Nugget Creek
could still hold the jackpot.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.333
So, it looks like
on the map right now

12:44.367 --> 12:47.867
that this...
The claim starts right here.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.734
Yeah, this is
where the top one is.

12:51.367 --> 12:54.000
And, uh, it's obviously
snowed in right now

12:54.033 --> 12:55.433
but if we get a little bit
of sunshine,

12:55.467 --> 12:58.233
I don't know how fast
this is gonna come away.

12:58.266 --> 13:01.233
Right there, I think, that's where
the bottom of the claim is.

13:01.266 --> 13:04.433
And it goes up from there.
What do you think?

13:04.467 --> 13:06.300
There's a lot
of exposed water

13:06.333 --> 13:07.834
once you get
out of that canyon.

13:07.867 --> 13:10.166
So, it's workable,
it looks like.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.533
If there's a place
we could set down

13:13.567 --> 13:16.400
and walk up there,
that would be awesome.

13:16.433 --> 13:19.433
To mine the
remote claim could cost Dustin

13:19.467 --> 13:21.767
nearly every penny he has.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.166
This works for you?

13:23.200 --> 13:26.433
Perfect, man.
This is absolutely amazing.

13:26.467 --> 13:28.567
So,
he wants to see it up close.

13:40.567 --> 13:43.100
Right here is where
I think the claim start

13:43.133 --> 13:46.033
and go up that way.
Way the hell up there.

13:46.066 --> 13:47.634
Okay. Well, it looks like

13:47.667 --> 13:49.100
there's some exposed bed rock

13:49.133 --> 13:50.467
- right up here.
-  Yeah.

13:51.433 --> 13:52.967
Uh, that bed rock,
it looks like

13:53.000 --> 13:54.567
it goes almost all the way across.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.333
-  Yup.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.233
Which might be a good sign.

13:58.266 --> 14:00.367
There's a lot
of big rocks in there,

14:00.400 --> 14:02.266
more in the granite family,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.333
that make for
easier splitting.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.934
Agreed.

14:05.967 --> 14:08.400
There's probably been
a few hobbyist divers

14:08.433 --> 14:09.867
but nothing like us.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.166
They've gotten gold out of it.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.333
It's been proven

14:12.367 --> 14:14.133
but it's never been ransacked

14:14.166 --> 14:15.500
like McKinley has.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.533
This is a gamble.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.934
What I need to know is
should we pursue this?

14:24.133 --> 14:27.033
You think it's gonna be doable
as far as getting out here?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.333
I don't know.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.133
All my life what I've done is

14:32.166 --> 14:33.533
figure out what I want

14:33.567 --> 14:35.100
and then figure out
how to get there.

14:35.767 --> 14:38.400
But it is nowhere.

14:38.433 --> 14:39.800
Yeah.

14:39.834 --> 14:41.433
I mean, it's not impossible.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.000
Yeah,
that's what that means,

14:43.033 --> 14:44.333
it's not impossible.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.467
I wanna show you something.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.667
They found a four ounce
nugget last year

14:50.367 --> 14:53.333
- right up there somewhere.
-  That's promising.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.100
We found a one
ounce nugget in McKinley

14:55.133 --> 14:58.700
but they did this in,
like, five days of digging.

14:58.734 --> 14:59.533
Hmm.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.266
I believe...

15:03.500 --> 15:05.233
that this is that
changing moment,

15:05.266 --> 15:07.500
that this is the place
for that.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.233
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

15:10.734 --> 15:13.467
Let's see
if we can get these claims,

15:13.500 --> 15:16.133
now that I got eyes on it,
I'm pretty psyched.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.867
-  Yeah.
- I'm ready to go.

15:21.967 --> 15:24.567
I can't wait to see
if I can get these claims.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.967
I'm excited.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.400
It's a new adventure,

15:28.033 --> 15:30.367
new ground, new everything.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.934
If I could pull this off,
this could change all of our lives

15:32.967 --> 15:34.667
and that's what I'm hoping
for right now.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.533
Up ahead.

15:40.567 --> 15:42.266
All right. Paul, good to go.
Go ahead and send it.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.033
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

15:45.066 --> 15:46.300
Little more. Little more.
Little more.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.567
Give it. Don't give up.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.066
-  Yeah.

15:49.100 --> 15:50.900
- Yeah.
-  Good deal.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.433
I need a road.
I need all my gears.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.100
And I'm feeling it.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.500
Gonna start to race
against the clock right now.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.400
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:04.433 --> 16:06.033
Broken!

16:06.367 --> 16:07.634
.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.800
I don't have
any time for this.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.967
Stressed out
of my damn mind right now.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.367
I'm losing my head
a little bit.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.967
In Haines, Alaska,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.100
the new gold mining season
is just days away.

16:34.367 --> 16:37.200
Dustin Hurt is trying
to secure a new claim

16:37.233 --> 16:39.567
that could deliver
a huge payday.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.367
Just had a meeting
with the claim owner

16:47.400 --> 16:51.634
and he put out
a pretty substantial number

16:51.667 --> 16:53.400
for the claims
he wants to sell,

16:53.433 --> 16:56.433
and the numbers
we're talking about

16:56.467 --> 16:58.066
are enough to break me.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.100
Completely break me.

17:02.233 --> 17:04.400
And if I spend all this money,

17:07.800 --> 17:10.600
and I can't get anywhere
with it, we're done.

17:10.634 --> 17:14.033
This would be the last time
we try this.

17:14.066 --> 17:17.467
I'll be paying for this
for the rest of my life

17:17.500 --> 17:19.634
if we mess this up
and don't get gold.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.600
What's going on fellas?

17:38.634 --> 17:40.200
-  What's up, man?

17:40.233 --> 17:42.634
Long time no see, man.
How's it going?

17:42.667 --> 17:43.967
Yeah,
you guys ready to do it again?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.166
Look at us man.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.233
With a deal made,

17:49.233 --> 17:51.066
Dustin's crew assembles.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.367
It doesn't look too bad.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.900
Not bad at all.

17:55.934 --> 17:57.700
It's gonna melt out here
fairly quick looks like.

17:57.734 --> 17:59.066
-  Yeah, it is. Yeah.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.400
All right.
Welcome back, y'all.

18:01.433 --> 18:03.333
And they're hungry for gold.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.133
What's the plan?

18:10.166 --> 18:11.767
So I don't think
we're gonna be going up

18:11.800 --> 18:13.567
to McKinley this year, guys.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.166
So where are we gonna go?

18:17.233 --> 18:19.233
I bought a new claim.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.800
And it's called Nugget Creek.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.400
It looks impossible to get to

18:23.433 --> 18:25.467
and it looks
even harder to dig.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.200
I'd like a new challenge.

18:27.233 --> 18:31.667
And I haven't seen the returns
that I want to see.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.834
I just...
I'm tired of picking up

18:33.867 --> 18:35.367
somebody else's scraps.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.700
What I'd like to do
is find something better.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.400
That makes sense.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.367
I'm always down for a new
adventure and better gold.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.000
Bigger, better gold,

18:43.033 --> 18:44.133
that's what we're looking
for right?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.600
- That's why we do this.
-  Yeah.

18:45.634 --> 18:47.000
Bigger, better gold.

18:47.033 --> 18:48.433
Okay.
But here's the thing,

18:48.467 --> 18:50.567
and it just like right on
the other side of McKinley

18:50.600 --> 18:51.567
how are we gonna get there?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.700
I mean, what's your plan?

18:52.734 --> 18:53.767
What's your idea?

18:53.800 --> 18:56.266
Well, this is it.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.834
This is our savior.

18:59.867 --> 19:03.000
This is gonna be our main mode
of transportation right here.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.066
The new claim is so remote.

19:08.100 --> 19:12.133
The fastest way to move this
entire gold-mining operation

19:12.166 --> 19:14.734
would be by helicopter,

19:14.767 --> 19:18.500
but that would cost tens
of thousands more dollars,

19:18.533 --> 19:21.500
which after making the deal,
Dustin doesn't have.

19:22.467 --> 19:23.567
I thought you were crazy

19:23.600 --> 19:25.000
for buying that thing
long time ago.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.266
I know it looks old.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.233
Believe me I know
how bad it looks.

19:28.266 --> 19:30.900
It's smashed, and it's old,
and it's rusted.

19:30.934 --> 19:33.667
It's got six-wheel drive,

19:33.700 --> 19:36.266
so this is gonna be our way
in and out.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.333
And it's nine miles
up a raging river.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.433
I take that back.

19:41.467 --> 19:42.900
Right now it's frozen,

19:42.934 --> 19:45.033
and after all that snow
is melted,

19:45.066 --> 19:47.800
not even this truck will
make it across that river.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.567
Mmm-hmm.
Not understanding this, man.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.867
Are we gonna, like,
drive up a river

19:52.900 --> 19:54.967
- nine miles or across...
-  Yes.

19:55.000 --> 19:55.900
a river?

19:55.934 --> 19:57.133
We're doing both.

19:58.533 --> 20:00.400
Dustin's truck and trailer

20:00.433 --> 20:03.166
will pull his crucial
gold mining equipment

20:03.200 --> 20:05.266
18 miles to Nugget creek.

20:06.066 --> 20:07.567
The only access

20:07.600 --> 20:09.567
for the final half
of the journey

20:09.600 --> 20:12.433
is up the thawing
Tsirku River bed

20:12.467 --> 20:15.634
which is surrounded
by five monster glaciers,

20:17.266 --> 20:18.734
with spring temperatures

20:18.767 --> 20:22.133
spiking 40 degrees
above normal.

20:22.166 --> 20:24.166
The crew need
to make the journey

20:25.333 --> 20:27.000
and bring in all their gear

20:27.033 --> 20:30.133
before the river floods
with glacial melt water

20:30.800 --> 20:32.634
cutting off the new claim.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.000
So a hundred-year old
military truck,

20:38.033 --> 20:41.233
five ton, that hasn't started
in a couple of years,

20:41.266 --> 20:45.600
pulling this CONEX box
that's on a makeshift trailer,

20:45.634 --> 20:47.500
going up a nine mile river

20:47.533 --> 20:50.266
which we have a small window
of opportunity

20:50.300 --> 20:52.834
before the water rises.

20:52.867 --> 20:54.300
Yeah, I get it.

20:55.367 --> 20:58.100
This is dangerous. Crazy.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.767
As I hear it good gold
but nobody can get to it.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.033
Nobody.

21:02.066 --> 21:03.400
That sounds like us.

21:05.066 --> 21:08.033
Dustin,
has sunk every last dollar

21:08.066 --> 21:10.400
into buying his new claim
at Nugget Creek.

21:10.433 --> 21:11.767
All right.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.767
Paul, you're gonna do
the honors

21:12.800 --> 21:13.667
of hooking this thing up.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.266
Copy, that.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.233
Now,
success rides on a truck

21:18.266 --> 21:20.300
that's been beaten up
by decades

21:20.333 --> 21:22.166
of harsh Alaskan winters.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.967
We're using an antique truck

21:28.000 --> 21:30.400
to get everything
to our new site.

21:31.867 --> 21:34.066
Something's that was probably
used in the Cold War...

21:34.100 --> 21:35.934
you know?

21:35.967 --> 21:37.100
All right.
Let me tighten these down,

21:37.133 --> 21:38.367
I think we'll be good to go.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.567
- Ready?

21:39.600 --> 21:40.734
Come on, baby.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.567
-  Yeah!

21:49.600 --> 21:51.567
Yeah!

21:51.600 --> 21:53.066
I knew
it was gonna start up!

21:56.266 --> 21:58.400
-  It works.

21:58.433 --> 22:00.567
- I knew it was gonna start.
-  It worked though.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
It turned over
with no problem.

22:03.567 --> 22:04.634
Hell, yeah.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.266
You had doubt.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.834
I can't believe it,

22:07.867 --> 22:10.800
that thing... that thing
was frozen for two years,

22:10.834 --> 22:13.166
and it freaking turned over,
no problem.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.467
No problem.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.767
I'm gonna take it for a ride.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.634
Get in.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.533
-  Yeah.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.233
Woo-hoo!

22:29.266 --> 22:30.433
It does work.

22:30.467 --> 22:31.634
It works.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.967
It works.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.900
This thing is
not built for comfort.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.367
This is a rough ride.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.600
It'll rattle the fillings

22:48.634 --> 22:50.400
out of your teeth
if you have 'em.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.967
It feels good to me.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.166
- Good job y'all.
-  Hell, yeah.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.300
In a race
against Mother Nature,

23:03.333 --> 23:05.100
the crew split up.

23:06.266 --> 23:07.967
Dustin in the dozer

23:08.000 --> 23:10.734
will plow the snow
up the Tsirku River

23:10.767 --> 23:13.934
to clear a path
for the old truck,

23:13.967 --> 23:16.734
while the rest of the crew
packs the container

23:16.767 --> 23:20.100
with their vital
gold mining equipment.

23:20.133 --> 23:22.600
-  All right.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.033
Well, we'll get
this thing hooked up

23:24.066 --> 23:25.734
and see if we can meet you
out there.

23:25.767 --> 23:26.567
All right.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.567
You a bit nervous?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.467
We as might as well talk
about time travel, man.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.367
That seems...
that seems a little bit more feasible, man.

23:35.066 --> 23:36.333
.

23:36.367 --> 23:38.066
All right.
Everybody knows what to do?

23:38.100 --> 23:39.100
-  All right.

23:39.133 --> 23:40.333
Let's go to it.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.967
Man, the things we do
to go out here and find gold.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.066
Six miles
up the Tsirku River...

24:07.467 --> 24:08.967
Dustin Hurt plows a path

24:09.000 --> 24:11.433
to his new
Nugget Creek claim.

24:14.700 --> 24:17.567
Man, this snow
is deep out here.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.700
While crew member
Scott Allen, scouts ahead

24:20.734 --> 24:25.433
to find a route clear
of hidden deadly deep water.

24:25.467 --> 24:27.533
That's three crossings.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.767
Seems like there's gotta
be a point one spot

24:30.800 --> 24:32.900
where we can cross just once.

24:36.233 --> 24:38.066
I'm thinking
this is gonna be it.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Everybody keeps
telling me how crazy I am.

24:50.333 --> 24:52.033
I'm gonna die out here.

24:52.834 --> 24:56.333
Oh! Here I am.

24:56.367 --> 25:00.066
I'm committed
and not backing down.

25:08.467 --> 25:11.100
But Dustin
is facing a big problem,

25:11.133 --> 25:15.066
high spring temperatures
are melting the snowpack.

25:15.100 --> 25:18.734
The path to his new claim
will soon be cut off.

25:22.233 --> 25:25.367
So, right now
I'm feeling kind of a panic.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.300
I need a road.

25:28.333 --> 25:31.467
I need all my gear
and I'm feeling it.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.867
Really feeling it.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.934
I'm trying to calm down
so I don't make

25:35.967 --> 25:37.033
any dumb mistakes,

25:37.066 --> 25:38.900
but truth is

25:38.934 --> 25:42.300
I'm starting to race against
the clock right now.

25:44.767 --> 25:46.266
One of the problems
of having this

25:46.300 --> 25:48.667
I don't know
what the problem looks like.

25:48.700 --> 25:49.734
I don't know what's here.

25:51.367 --> 25:52.166
Just don't know.

25:57.033 --> 26:00.900
Oh! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

26:01.467 --> 26:03.066
I broke it!

26:03.100 --> 26:04.333
.

26:11.567 --> 26:13.000
What happened?

26:13.033 --> 26:15.000
I hit a root.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.700
There's a stump right there.
I didn't know it was there.

26:17.734 --> 26:19.967
I don't have any time
for this.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.800
Look, it's bitten.

26:25.433 --> 26:26.834
Coming out bad.

26:31.834 --> 26:34.900
There she is.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

26:34.934 --> 26:36.667
.

26:36.700 --> 26:37.800
Wow.

26:37.834 --> 26:39.734
I never seen one blow
like that.

26:39.767 --> 26:41.667
I'm never...
Once, ever seen one

26:41.700 --> 26:43.400
blow like that.

26:43.433 --> 26:45.600
The hydraulic line blown.

26:45.634 --> 26:48.467
They'll have to go back
to Haines for a spare.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.100
Their day is over.

26:53.266 --> 26:54.266
Yeah,
that was my fault.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.667
Piss poor driving.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.500
Couldn't push little snow,
could you boy?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.400
I feel like an idiot.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.166
I can't believe
I just did that.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.233
I broke a dozer...

27:14.500 --> 27:16.567
in snow of all things.

27:29.467 --> 27:30.967
Two days later...

27:32.634 --> 27:35.000
That is where we blew out
right there.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.734
That is incredible.

27:37.767 --> 27:41.166
And a 60-mile trip
for parts...

27:41.200 --> 27:43.767
We had
a special-made hose.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.767
It's not the original part
but hopefully,

27:46.800 --> 27:49.500
all we have to do
is plug this in and go.

27:55.634 --> 27:56.900
Done.

27:57.767 --> 27:59.867
This might just work.

28:07.934 --> 28:08.900
Not leaking yet,

28:08.934 --> 28:11.166
but I got warm it up,
you gotta have to test

28:11.200 --> 28:13.433
the hydraulics,
you're gonna move it.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.500
I think we're good.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.900
She's good to go.

28:24.300 --> 28:27.066
The forecast says
that it's going to be hot

28:27.100 --> 28:29.500
and sunny for the next week

28:29.533 --> 28:32.634
which means all
these white stuffs goes away

28:32.667 --> 28:35.033
and goes into that river
right there,

28:35.066 --> 28:37.100
which that river comes up
several feet

28:37.133 --> 28:38.567
and we can't drive it.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.400
So we have to get
all of our gear here

28:41.433 --> 28:42.900
as soon as possible.

28:49.900 --> 28:52.367
At Porcupine Creek...

28:52.400 --> 28:54.333
That's about as much stuff
as we're gonna need

28:54.367 --> 28:57.700
and hope for the season.
I mean, we've got dredges.

28:57.734 --> 29:00.300
We've got our generators.
We've got cable.

29:00.333 --> 29:01.533
Everything
but the kitchen sink,

29:01.567 --> 29:03.266
but we'll figure that out
when we get there.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.266
We at least
got toilet paper.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.367
Well, let's lock this thing
down and get out of here.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.700
The whole
gold mining operation

29:10.734 --> 29:12.900
packed in the container.

29:12.934 --> 29:15.000
-  All right.

29:15.033 --> 29:17.200
Dustin's crew
travel nine miles

29:17.233 --> 29:19.767
down to the river entrance.

29:24.266 --> 29:27.634
This is definitely not what
we're used to doing.

29:32.634 --> 29:34.300
Nothing like having
to pack up and move.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.467
I hate moving.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.600
Oh, my [bleep] here.

29:46.634 --> 29:49.667
.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.934
Yeah, I don't know about that.

29:56.367 --> 29:57.667
At the downstream entry

29:57.700 --> 29:59.533
on the Tsirku River,

29:59.567 --> 30:01.667
the snow has already thawed

30:01.700 --> 30:04.900
and the water
is rising rapidly.

30:10.567 --> 30:12.400
All right. I'm gonna try
it out in low gear

30:12.433 --> 30:14.100
- and see how this goes.
- All right, Paul, good to go.

30:14.133 --> 30:16.066
Go ahead and send it, man.
Bring it.

30:20.734 --> 30:22.567
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.000
Push through it. Push through
it. Push through it.

30:24.033 --> 30:26.533
.

30:26.567 --> 30:27.900
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

30:27.934 --> 30:29.100
A little more. A little more.

30:29.133 --> 30:30.533
A little more. Give it.
Don't give up. Keep going.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.033
Move. Move. Move.

30:37.467 --> 30:39.867
-  Yeah!

30:39.900 --> 30:41.634
-  Yeah!

30:41.667 --> 30:43.634
.
I was so worried

30:43.667 --> 30:46.233
about part right there.

30:46.266 --> 30:49.000
We get past that.
I think we got it now.

30:49.033 --> 30:50.433
That was a big concern.

30:50.467 --> 30:52.066
If it'll... If it'll
go through this

30:52.100 --> 30:53.400
we'll make it the whole way.

30:53.433 --> 30:55.400
You're damn right.
We will.

30:55.433 --> 30:57.166
Hey, I told you I
was gonna Dukes of Hazard it.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.934
Go for it buddy.

31:31.166 --> 31:32.767
I never ever thought
I'd be off-roading

31:32.800 --> 31:35.367
a big ass army truck.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.433
-  With the CONEX.

31:59.233 --> 32:00.533
These water
crossings might

32:00.567 --> 32:02.066
be kind of crazy y'all.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.100
On the right here
there was barely any water

32:04.133 --> 32:05.834
with that yesterday.

32:06.934 --> 32:08.333
Wow!

32:11.567 --> 32:14.000
Hey, Scott, don't
be scared of the gas pedal.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.200
James, step on it.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.200
I think the biggest
struggle right now

32:28.233 --> 32:32.467
is that sand really wants
to put a lot of pull on you

32:32.500 --> 32:35.333
when you're trying to pull
the trailer through it.

32:36.934 --> 32:39.734
Stay right, stay right.
Come right, come right,

32:39.767 --> 32:41.000
come right.

32:43.033 --> 32:44.600
Pull right.

32:44.634 --> 32:46.700
Here we go.

32:46.734 --> 32:48.934
Woo-hoo.
Come on, don't stop now.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.166
Yeah. Don't get stuck
in the mud.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.800
She is struggling.

33:01.166 --> 33:02.300
Oh, [bleep].

33:02.333 --> 33:04.100
One just came
completely off.

33:04.133 --> 33:07.567
- What?
- Uh, we might be stuck.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.967
Yeah, you're buried.
There's no more tires left.

33:20.233 --> 33:22.266
-  I think we're stuck.

33:23.233 --> 33:24.700
Can you back up?

33:27.333 --> 33:28.734
I don't know
what we're stuck on.

33:32.166 --> 33:33.667
I have to get out and
go look and see what's going on.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.266
Yeah. You're buried.
There's no more tires left.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.867
On the Tsirku River,

33:39.900 --> 33:43.400
rapid snow melt has turned
the riverbed into quicksand

33:43.433 --> 33:47.200
sucking down the trailer
and stopping it dead.

33:49.467 --> 33:51.634
Dustin, you got a copy?
Dustin, you got a copy?

33:51.667 --> 33:53.000
Wes for Dustin.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.567
Hey, go ahead, man.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.367
We've got CONEX buried.
If is there any way

34:00.400 --> 34:03.066
you can work your way
downstream and maybe help us

34:03.100 --> 34:06.066
pull this thing out
or pull the CONEX itself?

34:06.100 --> 34:08.667
Are you kidding me?

34:08.700 --> 34:10.333
.

34:10.367 --> 34:12.367
Yeah, I'll come back.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.867
Okay. Copy that. Wes out.

34:18.467 --> 34:20.000
Their journey
along the Tsirku

34:20.033 --> 34:22.400
to their new claim
at Nugget Creek

34:22.433 --> 34:23.834
is nine miles.

34:25.200 --> 34:29.000
The truck and container
managed barely one.

34:30.133 --> 34:33.133
I wouldn't even call
this a crossing.

34:33.166 --> 34:35.700
There's no
like current to that.

34:38.767 --> 34:40.967
Dustin
spent his last dime hoping

34:41.000 --> 34:43.533
Nugget Creek
would pay out big.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.600
I see Dustin.

34:45.634 --> 34:48.400
He's not gonna be happy.

34:48.433 --> 34:49.934
If he can't
get the container

34:49.967 --> 34:53.100
with all his gear
to the claim,

34:53.133 --> 34:55.133
he's dead in the water.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.934
It was going good
until I came across

35:14.967 --> 35:17.100
this crossing right here.

35:17.133 --> 35:18.600
Well, once we lost
those tires

35:18.634 --> 35:19.767
is when [bleep] went bad.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.133
Well, I mean
that all happened right here.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.100
All right, all right.

35:22.133 --> 35:25.800
Just let me...
Let me just think for a sec.

35:33.100 --> 35:36.033
Well, I just spent all night
and all day plowing snow

35:36.066 --> 35:38.634
that doesn't look
like we'll even reach.

35:40.667 --> 35:42.433
This shouldn't have been
a [bleep] problem.

35:42.467 --> 35:44.533
The rest of it's going to
be a problem.

35:44.567 --> 35:45.934
-  You guys made

35:45.967 --> 35:47.500
about a half a mile?

35:47.533 --> 35:48.767
No, we're probably
further than that.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.734
I don't know.

35:50.767 --> 35:53.233
I'd say a mile or so.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.400
This is hard to
take right now looking

35:58.433 --> 36:02.667
over there and seeing
my trailer half underground.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.100
What I'm worried about
most is the water

36:10.133 --> 36:13.266
coming up and taking
everything from me.

36:14.934 --> 36:19.634
I'm trying to beat it
but it's not working out.

36:26.533 --> 36:30.467
I'm trying to un-destroy
this mess right now.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.767
Pushing the whole thing.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.467
Holy crap.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.667
That's probably
a good right there.

37:00.700 --> 37:01.867
Okay.

37:05.934 --> 37:06.834
Dude.

37:12.266 --> 37:15.300
Not the way
I thought this was gonna go.

37:19.066 --> 37:20.233
Woo.

37:20.266 --> 37:21.767
It's a rough one.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.166
I thought this was
gonna be the easy part.

37:36.967 --> 37:38.200
Yup. Dig it out
a little bit more.

37:38.233 --> 37:40.634
Uh, just a little bit
on that one.

37:40.667 --> 37:41.867
That's mangled for sure.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.266
That rim
and tire is totally gone.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.033
Dustin Hurt's hunt

37:49.066 --> 37:51.333
to find the greatest gold
of his life

37:52.600 --> 37:55.100
has led him to buy
a new claim,

37:55.133 --> 37:56.333
Nugget Creek,

37:57.367 --> 37:59.734
nine miles up
the Tsirku River.

38:01.367 --> 38:04.300
Only one mile in...
the container that holds

38:04.333 --> 38:07.133
all their crucial
gold mining equipment

38:07.734 --> 38:08.667
is stranded.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.100
Hey, man,
this can't be happening.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.500
-  Okay.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.300
gonna work.
We figured this out, right?

38:23.333 --> 38:25.467
- Yup.
- What I'd like to do,

38:25.500 --> 38:27.333
I'd like to find two logs

38:27.367 --> 38:30.233
to go underneath the axles
and lash them off

38:30.266 --> 38:32.066
and make a sled
out of this thing.

38:33.567 --> 38:35.467
Dustin's plan...

38:35.500 --> 38:37.867
attach logs
under the trailer,

38:37.900 --> 38:40.166
creating a two ton sled.

38:41.634 --> 38:44.367
Pulled by the dozer,
the sled should rise

38:44.400 --> 38:46.600
above the riverbed's
sinking sand,

38:47.600 --> 38:49.567
delivering
their crucial gear,

38:49.600 --> 38:52.200
so they can dive
for Nugget Creek gold.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.667
This is the first
time I've ever done this,

39:06.700 --> 39:09.400
so this would be
experimental for me.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.867
I don't know if it'll work
but we're getting desperate.

39:15.166 --> 39:17.567
So what we did was
we found the ledge

39:17.600 --> 39:21.200
and now we're gonna jam
two logs or trees

39:21.233 --> 39:22.567
right in here

39:22.600 --> 39:24.300
and we're gonna
back this thing

39:24.333 --> 39:26.367
over the top of them
and hopefully...

39:26.400 --> 39:28.700
we can make sleds
out of these logs.

39:35.767 --> 39:38.133
-  Beautiful.

39:38.166 --> 39:40.166
There's 20,000 pounds
of anchor for you.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.667
-  All right.

39:42.700 --> 39:43.967
-  We're doing this?
- Yeah, let's do it.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.467
He's building the Ark, dude.

39:51.133 --> 39:52.200
Are you ready?

39:59.100 --> 40:00.667
All good over here.

40:03.634 --> 40:05.433
Come in, come in.

40:05.467 --> 40:07.166
Let's go. And bring it,
bring it, bring it,

40:07.200 --> 40:08.500
bring it, bring it, bring it,
bring it, bring it,

40:08.533 --> 40:10.066
bring it, bring it [bleep],

40:10.100 --> 40:11.200
bring it, bring it,
bring it...

40:11.233 --> 40:12.634
You guys are good in here.

40:12.667 --> 40:14.300
Bring it,
bring it, bring it.

40:14.333 --> 40:16.033
Bring it, bring it,
bring it, bring it, come on.

40:16.066 --> 40:17.166
Bring it, bring it, bring it.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.300
Bring it.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.133
That's good,
that's good right there.

40:23.767 --> 40:24.767
Are you serious?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.400
Holy crap.

40:26.433 --> 40:27.800
Can you believe?

40:29.367 --> 40:32.233
Well,
all we got is straps, cables,

40:32.266 --> 40:33.333
and some chain.

40:33.367 --> 40:34.767
Let's make the best of it.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.033
Carlos, I think we're ready
to hook this thing up

40:39.066 --> 40:40.233
to the dozer and drag it, man.

40:40.967 --> 40:42.100
You ready for this?

40:42.133 --> 40:43.266
Yeah.

40:44.934 --> 40:46.967
Uh...

40:47.000 --> 40:48.934
I'm just praying, brother.
I'm not thinking anything.

40:48.967 --> 40:50.433
I'm just praying, bro.

40:50.467 --> 40:51.433
Just praying.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.367
Get to the [bleep] site, man.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.367
We got to pay
some bills, dude.

40:59.133 --> 41:00.367
Here we go.

41:03.967 --> 41:05.166
Move it!

41:06.233 --> 41:07.634
It's working.

41:15.767 --> 41:17.700
working great, man.

41:18.634 --> 41:20.900
The sled fix a success.

41:21.934 --> 41:24.367
It's working, man.
It's gonna do it.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.100
Woo-hoo!

41:26.133 --> 41:28.800
The next
challenge for Dustin,

41:28.834 --> 41:32.400
the rising Tsirku River's
two deepest crossings.

41:34.934 --> 41:36.500
Yeah, that's pretty
deep.

41:36.533 --> 41:37.967
That's deep, man.

41:40.433 --> 41:41.967
I think we're in trouble here.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.266
-  Look at that creek that goes...

41:44.300 --> 41:46.734
- Oh. Going all diagonal?
- Maybe I can get up that.

41:46.767 --> 41:49.100
You can probably cross
in better spots.

41:49.133 --> 41:50.867
I'm trying not to hit
any ledges.

41:50.900 --> 41:51.800
Oh, I gotcha.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.467
This thing is getting
uglier and uglier

41:54.500 --> 41:55.900
- every day, huh?
- Oh, yeah, it's getting bad.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.800
That water has come up a lot.

41:58.834 --> 42:00.900
And this is going to be
a challenge.

42:00.934 --> 42:02.433
We don't wanna get anything
stuck right now.

42:02.467 --> 42:05.000
That's our entire season
right there.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.700
All right.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.200
Let's see how the logs do.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.867
you're crazy dude.

42:20.533 --> 42:21.667
Let's go.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.900
It's doing it, Carlos.

42:26.667 --> 42:27.834
It's perfect.

42:30.734 --> 42:32.634
road.

42:32.667 --> 42:34.166
What's that?

42:34.200 --> 42:35.767
Oh, [bleep].

42:35.800 --> 42:37.300
Hey, what's that?

42:38.367 --> 42:39.634
How are we doing?

42:40.533 --> 42:42.200
- Deep?
- .

42:45.066 --> 42:46.266
.

42:47.033 --> 42:48.500
.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.133
Oh, boy. It' not doing it.

42:51.166 --> 42:53.367
Hold on, hold on.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.033
Hold on.

43:03.767 --> 43:06.333
After an epic
eight-hour journey

43:06.367 --> 43:08.634
hauling the sled
over seven miles,

43:08.667 --> 43:12.033
Nugget Creek is within sight.

43:14.066 --> 43:15.467
You burst.

43:17.967 --> 43:20.333
This crossing...

43:20.367 --> 43:23.000
looks like it has to be
the worst.

43:23.033 --> 43:25.967
The widest, the deepest.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.900
the finish line
is literally right there,

43:29.700 --> 43:31.834
right freaking there.

43:31.867 --> 43:34.533
It's gonna be deep
but it's not as deep as this.

43:34.567 --> 43:36.934
This is freaking
deep as hell right.

43:36.967 --> 43:39.767
The temperature dropped
this far upstream

43:39.800 --> 43:41.133
because of the freaking, uh,

43:41.166 --> 43:42.867
glaciers, the snow.

43:42.900 --> 43:44.900
We still got snow
on this side.

43:45.600 --> 43:48.066
It looks really deep.

43:49.934 --> 43:51.100
Come save me.

43:51.133 --> 43:52.834
Please come save me

43:52.867 --> 43:54.600
if I get stuck out there.

44:01.500 --> 44:02.767
I don't know what I'm doing.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.367
I don't know what I'm doing.

44:08.433 --> 44:10.300
And it tipped the [bleep] box.

44:11.600 --> 44:13.567
Bad things are happening.

44:14.767 --> 44:16.500
I'm in trouble.

44:16.533 --> 44:17.900
I bit off
more than I can chew,

44:17.934 --> 44:19.634
we're about to stall.

44:19.667 --> 44:21.333
.

44:21.367 --> 44:22.700
Wide open [bleep].

44:23.634 --> 44:24.967
Carlos.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.667
Please don't flip.

44:35.734 --> 44:36.667
Please don't flip.

44:50.166 --> 44:51.433
Carlos.

44:52.934 --> 44:55.834
Please don't flip.

44:57.600 --> 44:58.934
Come on, baby.

44:58.967 --> 45:01.066
Don't flip, don't flip.

45:01.100 --> 45:04.333
Just one mile short
of their final destination,

45:04.367 --> 45:07.367
Dustin may have pushed
it too far.

45:09.300 --> 45:10.333
Come on, baby.

45:14.166 --> 45:15.767
Oh my [bleep] God.

45:15.800 --> 45:20.367
Did that just happen?

45:21.333 --> 45:23.100
Woo-hoo!

45:24.000 --> 45:25.900
You one crazy [bleep].

45:25.934 --> 45:27.033
Hey, hey, look.

45:29.734 --> 45:31.233
That was insane.

45:31.266 --> 45:32.800
That was fantastic.

45:32.834 --> 45:34.066
Woo.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.000
We're rolling.

45:38.667 --> 45:41.066
Never gonna forget
this [bleep] man.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.133
Yeah, baby.

45:45.166 --> 45:46.266
Yes.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.667
The melting Tsirku River

45:51.700 --> 45:53.767
tested the crew to the limit.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.266
Oh [bleep] what a rush.

45:59.100 --> 46:01.634
But they finally
reached their new claim

46:01.667 --> 46:02.834
at Nugget Creek.

46:04.934 --> 46:07.066
It's so [bleep] awesome.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.800
And the possibility...

46:08.834 --> 46:11.400
of life-changing gold.

46:15.967 --> 46:19.266
We made it, Carlos.

46:19.300 --> 46:21.100
-  Yeah.

46:21.133 --> 46:22.166
Yeah.

46:23.467 --> 46:24.967
We did it!

46:25.000 --> 46:26.433
Woo!

46:29.166 --> 46:30.734
-  Finally!

46:30.767 --> 46:31.734
Now get it.

46:33.166 --> 46:34.600
Yeah.

46:39.867 --> 46:41.400
Holy crap, dude.

46:41.433 --> 46:43.467
I can't believe
we freaking made it, man.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.233
That is something.

46:45.266 --> 46:46.700
Let's not do that again.

46:46.734 --> 46:48.266
Of course
I had my doubts.

46:48.300 --> 46:50.033
I don't care...
I don't care what you say.

46:50.066 --> 46:51.934
I don't care.
I had my [bleep] doubts.

46:51.967 --> 46:53.533
I had my... I had big doubt.

46:53.567 --> 46:56.300
That's the longest
nine miles in the world.

46:56.333 --> 46:57.900
- That was only nine miles?
-  Yeah.

46:57.934 --> 46:59.700
-  We made it.
- We think this is bad.

46:59.734 --> 47:02.166
Imagine how they felt
on the Oregon Trail.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.800
- The wagons.
-  Those guys

47:03.834 --> 47:05.233
are so much tougher than me.

47:05.266 --> 47:06.600
We just did nine miles.

47:06.634 --> 47:07.700
They did thousands.

47:09.634 --> 47:11.400
What a hell
of a journey y'all.

47:11.433 --> 47:12.967
If that worked,

47:13.000 --> 47:14.834
then we got freaking gold
coming our way, man.

47:14.867 --> 47:16.567
And we put in
the freaking effort

47:16.600 --> 47:17.700
and the work for this.

47:17.734 --> 47:19.300
New site, bigger gold.

47:19.333 --> 47:21.066
It's gonna be hard to get to
but we're here.

47:21.100 --> 47:22.400
Everything's here.

47:22.433 --> 47:24.100
We're ready to get
started finally.

47:24.133 --> 47:25.533
-  Yeah.

47:25.567 --> 47:27.033
Yeah. Now let's just
go find a place

47:27.066 --> 47:28.333
and then start our camp,

47:28.367 --> 47:29.900
so we can start
living out here.

47:31.567 --> 47:33.900
But it better be
some damn good gold here.

47:34.900 --> 47:36.500
On the season ahead.

47:36.533 --> 47:37.700
There's a bear.

47:37.734 --> 47:39.567
We're in bear territory.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.533
That is moving
right there.

47:41.567 --> 47:42.667
Yeah, it is.

47:43.667 --> 47:44.533
This is scary.

47:44.567 --> 47:45.667
Well,
that'll kill you.

47:45.700 --> 47:46.634
Hold on, hold on.

47:46.667 --> 47:47.734
Rock, rock, rock, rock!

47:47.767 --> 47:49.767

- Two rules out here.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.400

-  Our gold

47:52.433 --> 47:54.700

-  Oh.

47:54.734 --> 47:56.567
It's not
safe out here.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.700
We need to get
out of here.

47:58.734 --> 48:00.200
- Dustin!
- What?

48:00.233 --> 48:01.934
I've got some gold, man.

48:01.967 --> 48:04.100
That's good gold, dawg.

48:04.133 --> 48:05.867
I think this is the crew
that can do it.
