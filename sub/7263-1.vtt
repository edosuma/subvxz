03:55.402 --> 03:55.569
Forget it, loser.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.127
Forget it, loser.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.295
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.161
- Hey.
- Hey, bro.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.674
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

04:04.345 --> 04:06.609
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.577
Jennifer...

04:19.660 --> 04:22.220
Did you see his eyes?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.445
What are you looking at, dork?

04:43.317 --> 04:45.251
Fuck off.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.016
I appreciate you guys coming down.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.320
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in this dump is...

04:53.927 --> 04:55.292
Settle down.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.891
Settle down.

04:58.399 --> 05:03.496
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.505
Settle down.
Settle down.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.941
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

05:12.279 --> 05:17.046
- That you, Jimmy?
- At least in study hall I can meditate.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.378
What he means is, "masturbate."

05:20.020 --> 05:24.218
Something with which I'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.544
It wasn't me, man.
It wasn't me.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.819
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

05:54.988 --> 05:59.925
We've all heard the terms
"date rape," "sexual harassment."

06:00.728 --> 06:04.687
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

06:05.466 --> 06:09.232
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.367
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

06:13.540 --> 06:15.405
...are here to give us
what we hope...

06:15.576 --> 06:17.976
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...

06:18.145 --> 06:21.603
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.307
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.313
- Thank you.
- I'm out of here.

06:29.490 --> 06:33.153
- Why don't we begin with a question.
- This prick can kiss my ass.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.967
As I was saying...

06:44.138 --> 06:46.732
...why don't we begin
with a question.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.934
- What is a sex crime?
- Not getting any.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.752
What's with that?
She's the one who walked out.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.680
- Suzie Toller.
- I busted her last year for possession.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.827
Poor kid did six months
in Camp Nine.

07:07.995 --> 07:11.055
- Six months? First offense?
- I didn't hand down the sentence.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.926
She was dirty.
I busted her.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.328
Hey, Carol.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.799
I appreciate you guys
taking the time to come.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.198
Our pleasure.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.807
Why do I get the feeling you don't
like the guidance counselor?

07:26.980 --> 07:30.416
Don't tell me you can't see through
his routine. He's a total hound.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.677
You mean pussy hound?

07:35.689 --> 07:38.055
Actually, I thought
he was kind of cute.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.782
I'd do him.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.485
Steady.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.460
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.829
That's good.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.307
Drop the main.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.745
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and I'll see you all Monday.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.025
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.793
Do you do windows?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.759
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.195
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.
- All right, buddy.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.944
All right.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.206
I could definitely party
on one of those.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.151
It's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

09:13.320 --> 09:17.381
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.054
Yeah.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.128
That's a real boat.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.093
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.895
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.

09:30.070 --> 09:34.097
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.572
I put myself through college
working on boats.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.836
- Beats flipping burgers.
- Yeah.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.947
Can I play too, or is it just for boys?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.689
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.959
The senior car wash, remember?

09:54.328 --> 09:56.819
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.431
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and I do it?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.397
We're working as a team.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.969
I tell you what. I'm going out
to the glades Saturday.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.107
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.867
Deal.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.809
I was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.448
Surprise, surprise.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.380
So I was wondering
if you could give me one.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.451
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

10:23.624 --> 10:26.024
I mean, like,
something bad might happen.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.196
- What about you, you need a lift?
- Yeah, but I got my bike.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.334
Hey, no problem.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.779
Okay, try it.

10:52.586 --> 10:56.078
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.

10:56.256 --> 11:00.249
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
"Whores 4 Less"?

11:03.130 --> 11:04.961
Try it again.

11:10.604 --> 11:13.266
Nice to see you kids getting along.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.646
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.818
- Is that Sam Lombardo?
- Hi, Mom.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.956
Sam, hi.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.555
Hi, Sandra.

12:11.164 --> 12:15.066
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.725
Sorry, Sandra, I gotta run.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.913
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.050
Hi, girls.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.418
Look. He forgot.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.748
- I knew it.
- No, I didn't.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.915
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.059
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.392
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

13:53.567 --> 13:56.866
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.629
Sam, I'm leaving.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.365
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?

14:03.443 --> 14:06.435
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.116
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.012
Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.891
Sam the philanthropist.

14:22.062 --> 14:25.759
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.661
Okay.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.236
- Have fun at the club.
- Okay.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.423
Wow.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.502
Looks brand-new.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.365
Aren't you forgetting something?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.973
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.943
Oh, yeah, that thing.

15:48.315 --> 15:52.149
- Can't we just...?
- Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.613
Okay, let me look for it.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.053
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.486
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.560
You can give me a ride
when you find it.

16:02.829 --> 16:07.061
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?

16:12.806 --> 16:15.866
- Go.
- Are you sure?

17:29.482 --> 17:31.575
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.983
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

17:36.956 --> 17:39.424
Goddamn it!

17:40.760 --> 17:43.024
- Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
- Hello.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.528
Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday...

17:45.698 --> 17:47.791
Jesus H. Christ!

17:49.269 --> 17:51.737
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.133
Come on.

17:55.942 --> 17:59.434
- Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
- It's a barracuda.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.212
If you weren't so busy
chasing booty...

18:02.382 --> 18:05.476
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.052
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.483
Why not?

18:09.656 --> 18:12.250
It's a barracuda. It's poisonous.
It'll kill you.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.952
Shit, man, I could say that
about most of the girls you date.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.256
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.934
- Sandra, what's up?
- Kelly skipped school today, Sam.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.634
Have you heard anything?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.306
Not a word.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.506
Never mind.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.113
I found her.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.684
Pull!

18:44.124 --> 18:47.992
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.529
Sandra, I'm real busy right now, so...

18:51.764 --> 18:55.632
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.534
- Yeah, well...
- I know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

19:00.874 --> 19:05.436
- So what?
- So maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.141
Aw, poor Sam.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.648
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?

19:12.986 --> 19:16.114
- Are you finished, Sandra?
- Grab a clue, honey.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.452
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.890
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.995
Goodbye, Sandra.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.365
Pull!

19:29.769 --> 19:33.000
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.265
Maybe I ought to try it.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.877
So let me guess.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.879
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.246
So you're taking the day off. Right?

19:49.756 --> 19:52.054
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.489
Whichever one I want.

19:57.163 --> 20:00.655
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

20:04.103 --> 20:05.627
What is it?

20:07.140 --> 20:09.131
I miss Dad.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.706
Jesus.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.945
I miss him too, sometimes.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.411
No, you don't.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.281
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.524
Oh, Kelly...

20:33.333 --> 20:35.699
I don't know why he did it.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.764
I really don't.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.505
Can l...?

20:50.617 --> 20:52.949
Can I get you anything?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.244
Do you want a Valium?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.724
I was raped.

21:03.029 --> 21:07.363
- What, honey? I can't hear you.
- I said, I was raped.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.228
What?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.533
I was raped...

21:15.842 --> 21:18.367
...by Sam Lombardo.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.280
Sam Lombardo?

21:23.950 --> 21:27.317
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!

21:27.620 --> 21:30.145
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

21:30.323 --> 21:34.157
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.729
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...

21:37.897 --> 21:40.957
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.293
We'd like to take her statement alone.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.964
- Are you all right with this, baby?
- Yeah.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.633
Okay.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.414
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

22:05.725 --> 22:07.249
I just wanna get it over with.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.153
We'd like to videotape this statement.

22:11.331 --> 22:14.767
I know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

22:14.934 --> 22:19.462
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.433
Are you ready?

22:31.150 --> 22:34.176
He started rubbing my shoulders.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.322
I let him.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.016
I mean, he's a nice guy.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.393
The next thing...

22:45.198 --> 22:48.497
...his hand was in my shorts.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.770
You know, from behind.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.909
His fingers...

22:58.778 --> 23:02.043
- His fingers...
- Take your time.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.719
They were in me.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.784
Both places, you know?

23:11.791 --> 23:14.419
Did he put himself inside you?

23:15.561 --> 23:17.153
Yes.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.991
I said "Stop."
I screamed.

23:20.166 --> 23:23.192
I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.599
He hurt me.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.264
Did you try to fight him?

23:31.944 --> 23:34.777
Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.346
Then what?

23:36.516 --> 23:39.747
He kept saying, "Let it happen.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.019
Let it happen."

23:43.790 --> 23:46.020
And then he just stopped.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.384
You mean he withdrew?

23:48.561 --> 23:51.928
I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.292
Try, Kelly.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.697
I know one thing he said.

24:02.809 --> 24:06.870
He said, "Don't worry.
I didn't come."

24:07.313 --> 24:09.338
I can't forget that.

24:10.750 --> 24:14.914
He said, "No little girl
can ever make me come."

24:18.691 --> 24:22.218
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus.

24:22.395 --> 24:25.455
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

24:27.733 --> 24:28.961
What?

24:29.135 --> 24:32.969
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.735
You want my gut? There it is.
I think she's acting.

24:37.910 --> 24:41.243
I think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.075
She's upset because he didn't.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.945
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.985
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.215
The line I have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.621
That doesn't make him a rapist.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.087
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

24:57.263 --> 24:59.595
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

24:59.765 --> 25:01.198
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

25:01.367 --> 25:06.066
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

25:06.239 --> 25:09.436
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

25:09.609 --> 25:12.703
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

25:12.879 --> 25:16.042
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.979
- You know what that'll mean for him.
- Yeah.

25:19.151 --> 25:24.350
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.307
All right.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.342
Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

26:20.513 --> 26:21.844
All right.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.349
That's what's left of my sailing class.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.691
Talk to me, Artie.

26:37.830 --> 26:41.027
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.830
Jimmy told me.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.635
Apparently, I'm the last one
to know about it.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.774
Sam, I...

26:49.709 --> 26:52.075
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...

26:52.244 --> 26:54.337
...with every member
of the school board.

26:54.513 --> 26:55.980
She's pushing for suspension.

26:56.148 --> 26:59.982
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?

27:00.152 --> 27:03.952
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddamn it.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.590
You gotta believe that.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.988
All I can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.151
They clear you, you get reinstated...

27:10.329 --> 27:12.991
You never get clear
of something like this.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.124
It stays with you.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.738
It follows you around forever.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.703
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.836
You're gonna need an attorney.

27:26.012 --> 27:29.379
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

27:29.548 --> 27:32.540
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.029
I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

27:53.205 --> 27:57.266
- Do you have an appointment?
- Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.536
Okay, then.

27:59.745 --> 28:02.270
Mr. Bowden,
your 10:30's here.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.416
Will you show him in, please?

28:07.386 --> 28:09.286
What brings you
to this part of town?

28:10.256 --> 28:12.383
Well, I was, until yesterday...

28:12.558 --> 28:15.550
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.488
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.531
Male or female?

28:23.969 --> 28:26.733
- The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
- As in Sandra Van Ryan?

28:26.906 --> 28:29.374
As in, I'm fucked.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.569
Why don't you tell me about it?

28:35.681 --> 28:37.808
- Shit, where do I begin?
- Start with...

28:39.251 --> 28:41.981
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

28:43.055 --> 28:47.458
She's a student. I was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.085
You got nothing to worry about.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.401
- What did you do to your neck?
- This?

28:57.036 --> 28:59.197
I don't have to wear it all the time.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.906
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

29:08.114 --> 29:11.083
All right, let me tell you
how I charge.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.226
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

29:21.393 --> 29:24.055
Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park your car today.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.791
You can't park me?
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

29:33.205 --> 29:36.265
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.433
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

29:39.612 --> 29:43.378
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.419
Barbara, let's go.

29:55.528 --> 29:58.122
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.822
You're finished in Blue Bay.

30:02.034 --> 30:06.630
I find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

30:07.439 --> 30:11.205
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Lombardo, please.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.279
That's all right, George.

30:41.707 --> 30:45.234
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

30:45.411 --> 30:48.642
- Welcome back.
- Rum and Coke.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.165
Hey! Are you all right?

32:21.674 --> 32:23.733
- I'm fine.
- Cool?

32:23.909 --> 32:26.070
That's too bad, motherfucker.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.289
Sam?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.330
Lombardo?

33:09.355 --> 33:12.256
Whoa, man! It's me.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.958
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.029
I can see that.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.466
Come on in.

33:25.471 --> 33:29.669
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?

33:30.576 --> 33:31.941
It was him, all right.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.671
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

33:34.847 --> 33:38.305
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.715
- Forget it.
- The lady has deep pockets.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.617
Believe me, I know how deep
her pockets are.

33:44.790 --> 33:49.227
I thought I might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.

33:49.595 --> 33:53.122
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

33:53.532 --> 33:56.467
I don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.763
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?

34:00.105 --> 34:03.074
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.699
A year ago...

34:05.878 --> 34:08.540
...when her old man
blew his brains out...

34:08.714 --> 34:10.944
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

34:11.116 --> 34:15.313
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.051
Meanwhile...

34:18.223 --> 34:21.623
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

34:21.793 --> 34:23.056
...or some crap.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.897
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

34:26.264 --> 34:29.234
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.165
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?

34:32.938 --> 34:34.963
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.902
And they're not gonna find it.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.177
Right?

34:43.482 --> 34:46.645
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.979
He's just showing off
for you now.

35:27.159 --> 35:29.286
Hey there, Ruby.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.758
I see you still got Walter.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.697
I was hoping something
had eaten him by now.

35:36.969 --> 35:40.029
- Can I help you with something?
- Suzie called us.

35:40.205 --> 35:42.264
Where would we find her?

35:43.509 --> 35:45.409
You know the way.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.547
You won't shoot her, will you?

35:56.855 --> 35:59.551
I don't believe she's armed.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.026
Yeah?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.496
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.

36:43.669 --> 36:48.470
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

36:50.709 --> 36:52.700
I mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?

36:53.445 --> 36:55.845
My partner, Detective Perez.

37:01.853 --> 37:06.153
It's Céline. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.

37:06.325 --> 37:09.089
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?

37:17.135 --> 37:19.626
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

37:21.206 --> 37:22.901
No.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.901
- Will they?
- I don't know.

37:27.512 --> 37:28.945
That bothers you?

37:31.850 --> 37:34.318
I wanna go outside.

37:41.326 --> 37:44.454
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

37:44.630 --> 37:46.621
About a year ago.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.961
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

37:50.135 --> 37:52.729
- Nope.
- So you were alone.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.565
Yeah.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.571
Did he come in with you?

37:56.742 --> 38:01.338
- I guess.
- You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

38:01.513 --> 38:04.448
Okay. Yeah, he did.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.208
And then what? Did he touch you?

38:06.385 --> 38:09.320
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

38:09.988 --> 38:12.889
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.

38:13.425 --> 38:17.486
- Just tell us the truth.
- I didn't say a thing to him.

38:18.463 --> 38:22.331
He just put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.626
I could be really pretty, he said.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.033
Did you ask him to stop?

38:28.740 --> 38:30.731
Shit.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.974
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.

38:34.146 --> 38:37.377
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- Yeah. Okay? He did.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.847
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.884
- Now are we done?
- Almost, Suzie.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.820
Almost.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.521
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

38:51.563 --> 38:55.055
No. He stopped by himself.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.727
Okay? Is that it?
Leave me alone.

38:59.271 --> 39:02.707
- Don't touch me!
- All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.671
He stopped.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.074
And that was it? He just left?

39:08.580 --> 39:10.445
Yeah.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.281
He did say one thing first.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.020
What was that?

39:16.755 --> 39:20.782
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

39:23.795 --> 39:25.626
Open the gate.

39:31.069 --> 39:34.436
- Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.974
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.

39:41.913 --> 39:45.849
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

39:46.017 --> 39:48.042
...instead of a public defender.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.454
I'm telling you, Ken, I'm innocent.

39:52.324 --> 39:56.124
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.635
So you're the new
chicken licker.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.508
Sandra, can we get your comment?

40:16.681 --> 40:18.808
Can I just have your feelings
at this time?

40:18.984 --> 40:21.452
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.746
Can you tell us anything?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.254
- Are you confident about the case?
- Very. Yes.

40:26.425 --> 40:29.292
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...

40:29.461 --> 40:31.452
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.530
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

40:33.698 --> 40:37.566
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

40:37.736 --> 40:41.399
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. In the end, the jury...

40:41.573 --> 40:44.440
...must choose between the words
of these 18-year-old girls...

40:44.609 --> 40:46.201
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

40:46.378 --> 40:49.040
Reporting from the courthouse steps,
I'm Nancy Duerr.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.875
Eyewitness News.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.089
The State of Florida
v. Sam Lombardo.

41:33.258 --> 41:37.160
The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman
presiding. All rise.

41:37.462 --> 41:39.362
We gotta stand up.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.524
Please be seated.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.364
Now sit down.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.183
Would you like more time, Kelly?

42:07.759 --> 42:10.887
I know that this is hard, Kelly...

42:12.097 --> 42:14.065
...but I have one more question.

42:14.232 --> 42:17.099
And even though it's something
we've been over...

42:17.269 --> 42:20.500
...I want us all
to be very clear about it.

42:21.540 --> 42:25.442
Kelly, when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...

42:26.044 --> 42:28.808
...intended to have sex with you...

42:28.980 --> 42:31.107
...what were your exact words?

42:31.683 --> 42:33.583
What did you say?

42:34.786 --> 42:37.220
I told him "No."

42:38.390 --> 42:41.052
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please."

42:43.628 --> 42:46.654
I screamed for him to stop.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.097
You screamed for him...

42:49.868 --> 42:51.665
...to stop.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.601
And did he?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.769
No.

42:58.643 --> 43:01.771
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

43:10.055 --> 43:11.920
Thank you.

43:17.929 --> 43:18.096
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

43:18.096 --> 43:21.862
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

43:22.033 --> 43:24.831
...of the former guidance counselor
has taken the stand.

43:25.003 --> 43:28.803
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered
an emotional account of events...

43:28.974 --> 43:32.410
...and was not swayed by
defense counsel's cross-examination.

43:32.577 --> 43:35.774
We'll come back live later
with an update of these proceedings.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.745
Reporting from the courthouse
steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...

43:38.917 --> 43:40.817
...Eyewitness News.

43:59.504 --> 44:01.165
Good morning, everybody.

44:03.408 --> 44:04.841
Ms. Toller.

44:06.277 --> 44:08.302
When you were...

44:08.480 --> 44:12.109
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

44:12.283 --> 44:15.343
...and you were allowed
to make one call...

44:15.520 --> 44:18.683
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
Isn't that correct?

44:20.058 --> 44:21.753
Ms. Toller?

44:22.427 --> 44:24.657
- Yes.
- And when you were expelled...

44:24.829 --> 44:27.195
...for destruction
of school property...

44:27.365 --> 44:30.596
I broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.

44:31.870 --> 44:35.362
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

44:35.540 --> 44:38.839
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

44:42.947 --> 44:46.644
It was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.308
Is that right?

44:48.486 --> 44:49.851
Yes.

44:51.322 --> 44:53.256
It seems to me...

44:53.425 --> 44:56.758
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

44:56.928 --> 44:58.623
He was.

44:59.798 --> 45:02.767
But all that changed when...

45:04.102 --> 45:06.400
...according to your testimony...

45:07.238 --> 45:09.399
...Mr. Lombardo...

45:09.574 --> 45:11.303
...raped you...

45:11.910 --> 45:16.643
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?

45:17.382 --> 45:19.577
- Yes.
- But then in May...

45:20.218 --> 45:23.745
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

45:23.922 --> 45:26.413
...and again allowed a phone call...

45:28.026 --> 45:29.550
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

45:34.666 --> 45:37.965
- So what?
- So what?

45:40.872 --> 45:42.567
So what?

45:45.343 --> 45:47.106
Oops, Suzie.

45:48.246 --> 45:53.013
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

45:55.620 --> 45:58.783
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

45:58.957 --> 46:01.517
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.851
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

46:04.028 --> 46:05.757
It was summer, he was gone...

46:06.364 --> 46:10.528
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

46:11.002 --> 46:13.095
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

46:13.271 --> 46:16.968
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?

46:18.510 --> 46:21.877
Is that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...

46:22.046 --> 46:24.640
...your friend?
- I said them because they happened.

46:24.816 --> 46:27.614
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...

46:27.786 --> 46:30.152
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

46:30.321 --> 46:32.346
I said he did.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.181
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.989
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

46:39.497 --> 46:42.159
Because I promise you,
if you are lying about this...

46:42.333 --> 46:43.960
...and I believe you are...

46:44.135 --> 46:47.593
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

46:47.872 --> 46:51.933
Which is why I'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.

46:52.110 --> 46:53.771
Suzie...

46:55.013 --> 46:57.208
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

47:01.886 --> 47:05.287
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.487
- Ms. Toller.
- Goddamn it!

47:14.032 --> 47:16.330
- This was not my idea.
- Objection, Your Honor.

47:16.668 --> 47:20.160
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

47:20.338 --> 47:23.535
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.

47:23.775 --> 47:25.800
Ms. Toller?

47:28.746 --> 47:31.180
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

47:32.750 --> 47:34.945
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.

47:35.119 --> 47:39.556
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!

47:39.724 --> 47:43.251
I think I made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

47:45.129 --> 47:46.926
Ms. Toller.

47:48.099 --> 47:50.897
I just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

47:51.603 --> 47:54.629
He was my friend at first.

47:54.806 --> 47:57.866
And then I got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

47:58.042 --> 48:00.442
...and I had to go away
to that hell hole.

48:00.612 --> 48:03.206
It's like you're his favorite,
and then "Who cares?"

48:03.381 --> 48:04.814
Make her stop.

48:04.983 --> 48:07.417
When Kelly said that
we should do this...

48:07.585 --> 48:09.450
...I thought, "Cool."
- Kelly!

48:09.621 --> 48:12.920
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.

48:13.091 --> 48:16.288
- Now they're gonna get screwed.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

48:16.461 --> 48:17.758
I have to object.

48:17.929 --> 48:20.693
Your Honor, please, may I be heard?

48:20.865 --> 48:24.733
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.

48:24.903 --> 48:26.165
Go sit down.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.908
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

48:34.712 --> 48:36.942
She's in love with him.

48:37.115 --> 48:39.379
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

48:39.550 --> 48:42.417
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.

48:42.587 --> 48:44.487
What? Kelly!

48:44.656 --> 48:46.817
You skanky bitch!

48:47.825 --> 48:50.919
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who I am?

48:51.095 --> 48:54.223
- I'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
- Right this way.

48:58.870 --> 49:01.600
Just get the hell away from me.

49:03.908 --> 49:05.842
Jesus, man! Let loose!

49:07.111 --> 49:10.137
I'm just thinking about where
I'm gonna stay.

49:10.315 --> 49:12.579
I lost my house.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.809
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.

49:14.986 --> 49:16.476
You'll get over it.

49:16.654 --> 49:19.782
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

49:19.958 --> 49:22.290
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.291
Just like that?

49:24.462 --> 49:25.724
Just like that?

49:26.464 --> 49:28.523
These people ruined your life, bro.

49:28.866 --> 49:33.303
I told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!

49:33.471 --> 49:37.931
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.

49:38.409 --> 49:41.810
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

49:41.980 --> 49:45.245
In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...

49:45.416 --> 49:48.977
...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.

49:49.253 --> 49:51.187
Excuse me. Over here.

49:51.356 --> 49:53.051
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

49:53.491 --> 49:57.018
Hey! Sandra!

49:57.228 --> 50:01.164
I want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

50:01.332 --> 50:04.301
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

50:04.469 --> 50:06.528
...hadn't thrown things.
- Fuck off.

50:06.704 --> 50:11.698
I cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!

50:11.876 --> 50:14.504
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

50:14.679 --> 50:17.648
I don't think you get it, Sandy.

50:17.815 --> 50:19.806
Your princess here
committed perjury.

50:20.451 --> 50:23.750
It'll be all I can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.

50:23.921 --> 50:26.981
Well, what are we going to do?

50:34.565 --> 50:37.466
- You're gonna love this place, Tom.
- Thank you.

50:38.903 --> 50:41.064
That jalapeño pork platter
will kill you.

50:43.641 --> 50:46.667
I mean, you can't eat sushi every day
of the week.

50:46.844 --> 50:49.244
Bowden, why don't you
cut the crap...

50:49.414 --> 50:52.383
...and tell me
what your client really wants.

50:55.286 --> 50:57.254
Okay, Baxter.

50:57.422 --> 51:01.324
My client wants your client
to saddle up...

51:01.492 --> 51:04.052
...so we can ride her ass
straight to the bank.

51:07.331 --> 51:10.300
You know, Ken.

51:10.568 --> 51:11.830
May I call you Ken?

51:13.905 --> 51:16.601
There will be other cases,
other days.

51:19.177 --> 51:21.543
The way I see it...

51:22.280 --> 51:24.009
...Tommy...

51:24.182 --> 51:27.515
...is that everybody's gotta
eat some shit sometime.

51:29.454 --> 51:31.217
You like yours hot?

51:31.389 --> 51:33.186
Yeah.

51:41.165 --> 51:44.100
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

51:57.682 --> 51:59.377
Ken.

52:11.496 --> 52:13.760
Sorry I'm late.

52:13.931 --> 52:15.364
Hold my calls, Lenore.

52:15.900 --> 52:17.561
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

52:40.224 --> 52:42.249
Thank you, Sandra.

52:47.698 --> 52:49.598
I'll be seeing you.

52:49.767 --> 52:52.031
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

52:58.209 --> 53:00.439
Nice to see you, Tom.

53:00.778 --> 53:02.370
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

53:05.917 --> 53:08.078
See you at the club.

53:10.321 --> 53:12.346
See you at the club.

53:13.057 --> 53:15.218
See you at the club.

53:15.426 --> 53:17.417
See you at the club.

53:18.062 --> 53:19.723
See you at the club, Tommy!

53:19.897 --> 53:22.923
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?

53:23.100 --> 53:25.159
Hey, my man!

53:27.205 --> 53:29.298
This is for you.

53:30.341 --> 53:32.070
- You did good, Ken.
- Yeah.

53:32.243 --> 53:33.938
Thanks.

53:35.112 --> 53:39.139
I know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.

53:39.317 --> 53:42.115
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.

53:42.286 --> 53:45.312
All right? Find a happy place.

53:45.523 --> 53:48.219
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

53:48.392 --> 53:51.623
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Lenore.

54:09.146 --> 54:11.580
Take care of my lizards?

54:19.924 --> 54:21.186
Hello, Kelly.

54:21.759 --> 54:23.351
Drop dead.

54:23.527 --> 54:27.759
You know how my mom's paying you
off? She's breaking my trust.

54:28.132 --> 54:32.364
I can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.

54:32.536 --> 54:33.798
I'm sorry, Kelly.

54:33.971 --> 54:36.963
Why don't you start fucking her
again! You can spend it together!

54:37.141 --> 54:39.803
I hate you! I fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!

54:40.344 --> 54:42.278
I fucking hate you!

54:54.492 --> 54:58.519
You see, Art? I couldn't come back
even if I wanted to.

55:36.167 --> 55:38.226
Goddamn maid.

56:13.838 --> 56:15.772
So you got my mom's money.

56:17.475 --> 56:19.067
How much?

56:19.977 --> 56:21.467
How much?

56:22.213 --> 56:24.477
You know how much.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.546
Your turn to pay.

56:29.754 --> 56:33.087
It worked! We screwed the bitch!

56:33.924 --> 56:36.620
It worked just like you said.

56:37.862 --> 56:39.420
What's wrong?

56:39.597 --> 56:42.862
You scared the shit out of me.
What's wrong is your coming here.

56:43.033 --> 56:46.662
That's what's wrong.
Are you fucking crazy?

56:47.738 --> 56:51.139
Yeah, I'm crazy. Ask my mom.

56:54.478 --> 56:57.811
So how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?

56:58.916 --> 57:02.079
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke.
Big joke.

57:02.253 --> 57:06.189
Everyone thinks this is really funny.
Do you think this is fucking over?

57:06.357 --> 57:09.884
Let me tell you something.
It's a long fucking way from over.

57:11.295 --> 57:13.456
I'm serious.

57:15.900 --> 57:19.859
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.

57:22.673 --> 57:24.197
After tonight?

57:25.142 --> 57:26.905
Yeah, well...

57:27.445 --> 57:29.470
...we're here, aren't we?

57:32.349 --> 57:34.977
So maybe one celebration
is okay...

57:35.719 --> 57:37.880
...if we're in agreement...

57:38.823 --> 57:40.654
...that from here on out...

57:42.660 --> 57:45.424
...you do exactly as I say.

58:27.938 --> 58:31.430
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.

58:44.154 --> 58:46.622
Now I want you two to kiss.

58:48.259 --> 58:50.227
Come on, now.

58:50.394 --> 58:53.488
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:14.241
I told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:18.645
Hey, you're right.
They did make us look stupid.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.207
What you're wrong about is why.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:23.351
All right, hear me out.

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:26.756
Lombardo was having an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan, right?

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:28.221
Why not tell us about it?

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:31.725
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.989
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:38.498
I thought about it and said: "You're
Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

01:00:38.669 --> 01:00:41.570
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless..."

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.468
Unless what?

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:48.776
Unless you're setting Sandra
Van Ryan up for the big payday.

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:52.382
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:56.485
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl
like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:59.088
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:03.158
Kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:07.727
I'm telling you,
this guy wanted to marry money.

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:11.992
When that didn't happen,
he went to work on these two girls...

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.160
...using them to set up
Sandra Van Ryan.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.568
I'm telling you,
they chumped us, partner.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.709
They chumped us
right from the start.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.029
Nice stroke.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.726
Is there some reason
why you're here?

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:22.167
- Curiosity, I guess.
- About what?

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:25.035
How to improve your breast stroke?

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:30.673
No. I want to know how you see things
working out for you, Sam and Suzie.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:33.711
Excuse me?

01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:36.216
You three gonna
go to the Caribbean together?

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:37.819
Live happily ever after?

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:41.385
You see, the thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:42.820
You're out of your mind.

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:46.326
It's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:49.364
Especially when
two of them are in love.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:54.165
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:56.606
Am I right?

01:02:56.774 --> 01:03:00.107
Sam sell you on the idea right up
front of whacking Suzie? Hey!

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:03.610
That's murder, kid.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.944
Police. God, get a life.

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:10.620
You're good, you know that?

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:16.584
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

01:03:37.714 --> 01:03:39.909
Hello, Suzie.

01:03:40.784 --> 01:03:42.513
You better watch it
with that shit.

01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:45.382
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:47.717
Yeah, or wind up dead.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.625
You know...

01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:01.965
...I don't think I ever told you
how sorry I was about your friend.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:04.172
What was his name?

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:10.938
Come on, help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:17.850
- Davy.
- Yeah. That's right. Davy.

01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:20.248
I was sorry about
the way that worked out.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:23.222
- That is cop bullshit.
- What was that? What was that?

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:26.362
I don't have to listen to this.
You can't shove me around.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.725
- I have friends now.
- Hey!

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:31.663
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:35.362
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.

01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:41.744
Take a look at this.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:44.947
Go ahead, take it.
It's not gonna bite you.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:46.711
Take it!

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.550
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:58.919
He transferred the funds to
a numbered offshore account.

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:02.122
Cops don't know the names on it.
Think one of them is yours?

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.298
He also put a down payment on island
property and a lease on a sailboat.

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:09.098
You're into sailing, aren't you?

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:12.436
I don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:15.669
I'm telling you this because
I know exactly what's going on.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.913
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.017
Come on, now.

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:25.780
You don't think Kelly and Sam are
gonna share that money with you.

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:30.016
Leave me alone.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:40.060
You know...

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:42.933
...l'd want a clear head
right now if I were you...

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.836
...so I could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:52.048
I'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.246
...like Davy.

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.025
Oh, shit.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:18.463
You've reached Sam Lombardo.
Wait for the beep, leave a message.

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:36.790
I can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.292
I'm scared there's no one to trust.

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:41.795
You can trust me.

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:50.005
Hello?

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:53.234
- Kelly, is Suzie there?
- Yeah.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.378
Christ, I was afraid of that.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.513
She left this insane message.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:00.149
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:02.615
...and this fucking cop,
she's gonna blow it.

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:05.617
Calm the bitch down.

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:08.758
Why can't you come? Please?

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:13.054
Sam, I miss you so much.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:19.558
I miss you too, Kelly,
but I can't right now.

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:21.727
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:24.671
If she can't get a fucking grip...

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:27.901
- Then what?
- You know what.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.274
I'll handle it.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:33.814
But I need you, Kelly.
I need you to be there for me tonight.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:37.247
- Okay.
- Good.

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:40.288
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know that?

01:07:41.525 --> 01:07:44.961
Now, put Suzie on the line.
I want you both to hear this.

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:47.657
Suzie.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.226
Sam?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.890
Now, look...

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:54.970
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.

01:07:55.138 --> 01:07:58.369
Now, since the settlement,
people think I'm rich...

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:01.909
...so I'm out there spending money,
doing what rich guys do.

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:06.004
This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try
and fuck with you. Don't let him.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:10.313
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- Suzie, don't fall apart.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.387
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.323
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.526
Oh, for chrissake.

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:28.193
You are!

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:32.774
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:37.676
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.

01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:40.143
Don't!

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:46.353
You stupid cunt!

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:20.921
You are scared, aren't you?

01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:49.134
Ray! Jesus Christ!

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:51.503
- Are you crazy?
- Hear her say "Sam"?

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:54.909
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:57.417
The conversation on the tape
is unintelligible.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.181
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:03.190
...shooting a porn flick!
- I can't believe this.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.295
A month ago, they threw things
at each other in court.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:09.091
They were acting!
They were all acting!

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.097
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:14.203
They're getting away with $8 million
from Sandra Van Ryan.

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:17.067
She might have saved it
if she didn't try to ruin him.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.471
You wouldn't go after a guy
you thought raped your daughter?

01:11:20.644 --> 01:11:22.976
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:27.014
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:30.681
I've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep mucking around...

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:33.345
...and she's gonna sue us
for invasion of privacy.

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:36.117
So get out of these people's lives!
Hey! Ray!

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:40.827
- Hey! Am I getting through?
- You think this is just about money?

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:43.124
About us looking stupid?
Question him.

01:11:44.234 --> 01:11:48.432
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.

01:11:48.605 --> 01:11:50.004
Give him something to do.

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:52.835
- Look into the Kennedy assassination.
- I understand.

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:55.534
Next time this fucking piece of shit...

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:57.737
...drags me down here,
I'm gonna sue you.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:00.246
You're goddamn lucky
I didn't sue last time.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.509
- I agree.
- Am I free to go?

01:12:02.686 --> 01:12:04.881
- Yes.
- Thank you.

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:09.990
- Cocksucker.
- Yeah, what was that?

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.857
- You heard me, motherfucker.
- Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:19.229
What are you looking at?

01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:06.646
- I guess I kind of lost it out there.
- You could say that.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:14.148
Were you ever in a situation
where you saw something coming...

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:16.656
...and you didn't do
what you could to stop it?

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.625
We all have.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:22.663
I mean something bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:26.464
...and you...
You didn't do anything, and...

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.404
I did that once.

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.538
I don't wanna do it again.

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:57.663
I thought we were going to a movie.

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:02.971
I think we just need to get wasted.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.267
Yeah.

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:24.650
Come on.

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:34.130
I wanna live at the beach someday.

01:14:34.471 --> 01:14:36.166
Oh, shit.

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:39.035
I left the keys.

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:40.767
I'll get them.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:01.928
Kelly?

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:03.725
Suzie.

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:07.999
It's me.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:15.778
I was worried about you,
and I decided...

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:20.211
...the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.

01:15:20.817 --> 01:15:23.752
- Are you mad at me?
- No, no.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.354
I probably should've told you
a bit more about...

01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:28.821
...the part I intended to play.

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:30.926
But we'll go through it again tonight.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:39.157
This is a celebration, Suzie,
not a suicide pact.

01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:43.271
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:45.964
...have a little champagne...

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.939
...watch the stars...

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.376
Kelly?

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:53.209
You got a blanket in the back
of your mom's Rover?

01:15:54.317 --> 01:15:57.309
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it for us?

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:01.584
Good girl.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:05.751
Let me tell you about the boat
I picked out for us.

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.787
You okay?

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:15.627
My mom would kill me
if she knew I took the Rover.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.353
Been four-wheeling?

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:21.530
- Get off my property!
- I'm not on your property.

01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:24.895
- Lf you don't get out of here...
- You'll call a cop? I am a cop!

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:26.729
Goddamn it!

01:18:48.691 --> 01:18:50.852
So you say she didn't
come home last night.

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:55.327
She's been talking about going to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:58.558
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:04.465
Found some teeth in an old trailer
down the road.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.699
He says they'll fit.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:10.839
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:14.710
Oh, and now they're saying
that she can't graduate.

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:18.945
It is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her
into this whole mess, and you know it.

01:19:19.122 --> 01:19:21.317
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:24.483
We find something,
you'll be the first to know.

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:27.361
Come on.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:48.215
It's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:51.512
Ray, we don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:54.178
I'll drop you off.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.

01:19:54.357 --> 01:19:55.984
You got someplace you wanna be?

01:19:56.826 --> 01:20:00.057
- You got a date?
- Just check the car out for me.

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:12.138
It's over here, by that old boat.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:15.904
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?

01:20:16.078 --> 01:20:17.978
Yeah, sometimes.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.581
A lot of the kids hang out here.

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:24.915
You really think something bad
happened to Suzie?

01:20:25.454 --> 01:20:27.649
Lombardo ever come out here?

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:31.655
I say something funny?

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:36.026
No, but I mean, just the idea
that Mr. Lombardo would...

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:39.760
Well, the way I heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:41.460
You and him were pals, right?

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:44.902
Yeah, but he got me
onto the sailing team.

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:48.043
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.

01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:52.113
Sam Lombardo went to the University
of Miami on an athletic scholarship.

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:56.240
Boats didn't have a damn thing
to do with it.

01:21:46.802 --> 01:21:48.793
Listen, I'm gonna be here a while, kid.

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:51.804
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?

01:21:57.647 --> 01:21:59.274
Hey, Jimmy.

01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:05.921
People aren't always what they
appear to be. Don't forget that.

01:22:23.372 --> 01:22:25.670
- This is where they did it.
- Where's the body?

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:27.934
The swamp, most likely.
Guy's a swamp rat.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.601
He knows it won't be found,
but he made a mistake.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:34.580
She'd been threatening to run away
and I found the car at the bus terminal.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.445
You don't think Sam put it there?

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:39.850
Hold on a second.
Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.

01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:43.423
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

01:22:43.592 --> 01:22:45.787
Little sociopath's the one
who started this.

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:49.022
- How long till we get something?
- We can get blood type now.

01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:52.690
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:56.294
Poor, dumb Suzie.
Kid never had a chance.

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:59.134
- We don't know that.
- I'm telling you, Kelly's next.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:03.108
I'm telling you, you get
off this right now.

01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:07.543
Don't even fucking let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.510
David!

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:15.054
You get an ID, you call me!

01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:18.654
Will you do me a favor?

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:21.454
Ray, you heard him.

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:24.599
He told me to stay away.
He didn't say anything about you.

01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:27.258
What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:29.904
Please, you gotta help me out
on this, partner.

01:23:30.306 --> 01:23:33.605
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?

01:23:34.877 --> 01:23:38.779
If I'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.954
- Hello?
- I've been calling you.

01:24:25.127 --> 01:24:26.924
- I wanna see you.
- Where are you?

01:24:27.096 --> 01:24:29.758
- The stupid guest house.
- Good. Stay there.

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:31.729
Sam, I'm really nervous.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:34.498
Kelly, relax.

01:24:34.804 --> 01:24:37.272
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.137
In a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:43.437
But what if they find out?

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:46.476
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:48.082
Look, Kelly...

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.151
...stay in the guest house,
skip the graduation parties.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.851
I love you so much.

01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:55.991
And I love you too, Kelly.

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:58.126
Be a good girl
and stay where you are.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:23.774
Peeping in people's windows?

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:25.886
Isn't that against the law?

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:29.519
Suzie Toller's missing.

01:25:30.593 --> 01:25:33.221
- Since when?
- She didn't come home last night.

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:36.360
We found her car
at the bus terminal.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.327
Ray thinks she was murdered.

01:25:39.068 --> 01:25:41.195
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

01:25:42.938 --> 01:25:45.805
You could tell me
where you were last night.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:49.573
I suppose I could,
but I don't really have to, now, do I?

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:53.909
Come here.

01:25:55.251 --> 01:25:57.378
I wanna show you something.

01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:10.690
Looks like goodbye.

01:26:11.367 --> 01:26:13.130
Kelly's file.

01:26:13.369 --> 01:26:17.135
Read it. You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:19.831
...who threatened the lives
of at least two people.

01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:21.442
What two people?

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:23.805
One of them was her mother.

01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:26.037
The other one was...

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:28.940
...a female classmate...

01:26:30.553 --> 01:26:33.215
...she may have been
sexually involved with.

01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:35.847
Suzie?

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:39.494
Now you got the file.

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:41.428
Read it.

01:26:42.264 --> 01:26:45.427
I think it'll give you a new
perspective on things.

01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:49.936
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

01:26:51.974 --> 01:26:54.772
Because then I had principles.

01:26:54.944 --> 01:26:56.775
That meant a lot to me.

01:26:58.814 --> 01:27:00.247
Now...

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:03.651
...I don't care.

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.997
I should probably go now.

01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:25.607
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:56.060
- Duquette. What's happening?
- I'm tired. I'm going home.

01:27:56.238 --> 01:27:57.728
- Where's Lombardo?
- He's gone.

01:27:57.906 --> 01:28:01.103
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.

01:28:01.277 --> 01:28:03.336
Let me tell you something, Ray:

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:05.537
There's more to this story
than you know.

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:07.272
If Suzie is dead...

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.883
...Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.

01:28:12.087 --> 01:28:13.611
Ray?

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:17.224
Shit, Ray.

01:28:26.535 --> 01:28:29.663
- Who is it?
- It's Detective Duquette.

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:31.703
Open the gate, now.

01:29:03.072 --> 01:29:05.233
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:26.961
Where's...? Kelly! Kelly!

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:38.302
I just looked away for a second,
just a split second.

01:29:38.607 --> 01:29:41.405
And just like that, bingo...

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:43.939
...she put a knee in my groin.

01:29:44.113 --> 01:29:46.911
I didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...

01:29:47.416 --> 01:29:49.145
...just enough.

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:51.743
I couldn't get to her.

01:29:52.588 --> 01:29:54.613
She turned on me with the gun.

01:29:56.759 --> 01:29:58.920
Fired one shot.

01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:01.555
I took the hit in the shoulder.

01:30:04.933 --> 01:30:06.867
I had no choice.

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:12.070
I had to return fire.

01:30:13.809 --> 01:30:17.404
Two rounds, I think,
in the chest.

01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:23.414
I went there to protect her.

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:28.815
I went... I went there to protect her.

01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:30.720
Detective Duquette.

01:30:30.893 --> 01:30:34.420
I spent time in military intelligence,
and we had a saying there:

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:37.861
"Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

01:30:38.033 --> 01:30:40.126
Three times is enemy action."

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:42.327
This is twice for you, Duquette...

01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:45.803
...and I intend to see to it
that there is no third time.

01:30:46.275 --> 01:30:50.143
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

01:30:50.312 --> 01:30:53.042
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.

01:30:53.215 --> 01:30:56.082
Consequently,
two young women are dead.

01:30:56.685 --> 01:31:00.746
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

01:31:00.923 --> 01:31:02.584
Chief Goodsall...

01:31:02.758 --> 01:31:06.990
...Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

01:31:07.162 --> 01:31:09.630
...near the area known as
Stoner Beach.

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:13.029
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

01:31:13.202 --> 01:31:16.194
This has led this office to conclude...

01:31:16.538 --> 01:31:19.996
...that Susan Marie Toller was
murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

01:31:21.176 --> 01:31:23.508
She...
She didn't.

01:31:25.948 --> 01:31:27.643
Mr. Duquette.

01:31:28.116 --> 01:31:29.777
Mr. Duquette.

01:31:30.219 --> 01:31:33.848
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:01.944
Thank you, Paul.

01:32:56.705 --> 01:32:57.933
Howdy, partner.

01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:03.709
Jesus, man. I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

01:33:07.449 --> 01:33:09.349
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.

01:33:09.518 --> 01:33:12.009
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.

01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:14.087
The bitch shot me.

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:17.748
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?

01:33:17.926 --> 01:33:20.417
You know, shoot them
in the leg or something?

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:23.929
Did you become squeamish
about this stuff before or after...

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:27.330
...you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?

01:33:27.502 --> 01:33:30.960
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
It wasn't part of the plan.

01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:35.633
It couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.

01:33:35.811 --> 01:33:37.642
I couldn't talk them out of it.

01:33:37.813 --> 01:33:39.804
I'm telling you,
I don't like surprises.

01:33:40.015 --> 01:33:43.951
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:46.053
Now there's no loose ends.

01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:49.713
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.

01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:53.383
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...

01:33:53.829 --> 01:33:57.526
...I spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...

01:33:58.734 --> 01:34:00.531
...to make the transfer, so...

01:34:00.702 --> 01:34:02.226
- Bullshit.
- Oh, yeah.

01:34:02.404 --> 01:34:04.099
Call them yourself.

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:08.602
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.

01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:12.804
We'll take out the boat.
I just had it outfitted.

01:34:13.382 --> 01:34:15.247
I could use a deck hand.

01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:23.157
Here's to large bank accounts.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:29.052
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:35.530
To large accounts
and no loose ends.

01:34:36.438 --> 01:34:38.303
And no loose ends.

01:34:56.692 --> 01:34:59.593
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?

01:35:01.096 --> 01:35:03.360
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.

01:35:08.103 --> 01:35:09.764
- You mean that thing?
- Yeah, Ray.

01:35:09.938 --> 01:35:14.068
We call it a winch.
It's what we use to tighten the sails.

01:35:14.242 --> 01:35:18.372
- So why don't you start cranking?
- This is supposed to be a vacation.

01:35:18.547 --> 01:35:20.538
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:23.878
Come on, Ray.
I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.651
Or get me drowned.

01:35:40.769 --> 01:35:41.997
It's stuck.

01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:45.401
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Put a little elbow grease in it.

01:35:49.678 --> 01:35:51.270
It's stuck, I'm telling you.

01:35:53.148 --> 01:35:55.412
The jenny sheet must be
caught on something.

01:35:55.584 --> 01:35:58.849
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:02.512
- I don't understand a word you said.
- Okay, Ray.

01:36:02.691 --> 01:36:05.660
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...

01:36:05.827 --> 01:36:08.455
...and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.

01:36:10.232 --> 01:36:11.790
You're killing me.

01:36:20.542 --> 01:36:24.501
- You mean this thing?
- That's it. That one right there.

01:36:24.913 --> 01:36:26.904
You see anything?

01:36:29.851 --> 01:36:31.716
Look a little lower.

01:36:31.987 --> 01:36:33.215
That's it.

01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:44.822
Guess I forgot to tell you, Ray:

01:36:46.535 --> 01:36:49.026
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.

01:36:49.437 --> 01:36:51.564
First rule of sailing.

01:37:16.865 --> 01:37:18.127
Ray!

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.928
- What happened?
- Nice try, motherfucker!

01:37:30.078 --> 01:37:31.705
You!

01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:34.338
You're dead!

01:37:34.549 --> 01:37:36.016
No, I'm not.

01:37:38.687 --> 01:37:40.120
Sam.

01:37:40.288 --> 01:37:43.780
- Sam, for chrissake!
- Sorry, partner.

01:37:43.959 --> 01:37:46.519
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

01:37:46.695 --> 01:37:50.062
You shouldn't have killed that kid
out in the glades either.

01:37:50.232 --> 01:37:53.065
- What was his name?
- Davy.

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:07.841
That's my son, Walter.

01:38:08.016 --> 01:38:13.113
He's been doing this a long time,
so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.

01:38:13.288 --> 01:38:16.689
Thank you so much
for coming down to the glades.

01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:34.574
Did you come here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

01:38:34.843 --> 01:38:37.004
No. Actually, it's my day off.

01:38:38.847 --> 01:38:40.576
I thought you looked different.

01:38:40.749 --> 01:38:43.309
I came because I was hoping
you would talk to me.

01:38:44.853 --> 01:38:46.150
About Suzie?

01:38:46.321 --> 01:38:50.087
Actually, I was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.

01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:58.055
He used to come around here.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.267
He had a thing going
with one of the girls...

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:05.998
Girls. Over at the glades.

01:39:06.841 --> 01:39:10.436
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what I hear.

01:39:11.179 --> 01:39:14.910
- She still work there?
- Not after that night.

01:39:15.483 --> 01:39:17.644
All I know is, the next morning...

01:39:17.819 --> 01:39:21.755
...she was gone and a boy was dead.

01:39:21.923 --> 01:39:27.361
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

01:39:30.732 --> 01:39:34.998
Caught Ray slapping her around,
and he tried to stop it.

01:39:36.004 --> 01:39:38.871
So Ray killed him.

01:39:39.641 --> 01:39:41.871
Suzie saw it.

01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:46.078
So he busted her and sent her up.

01:39:46.247 --> 01:39:50.911
You know, just to prove that he could.

01:39:51.653 --> 01:39:54.713
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.

01:40:05.867 --> 01:40:07.835
To Ray.

01:40:08.203 --> 01:40:11.832
We won. Sam, it's over.

01:40:19.314 --> 01:40:23.648
Wow. Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.

01:40:23.818 --> 01:40:28.016
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before I can get rid of you.

01:40:39.667 --> 01:40:41.066
Okay, Toller.

01:40:41.236 --> 01:40:43.966
I wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.

01:40:44.873 --> 01:40:48.741
- Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
- It doesn't work that way.

01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:51.037
You don't drive it, you sail it.

01:40:52.047 --> 01:40:54.242
Now, get on that winch.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:58.284
I just wanna cruise for a while.

01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:06.486
That's funny. That's one of the first
things I noticed about you, Sam.

01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:09.562
You like to cruise.

01:41:11.199 --> 01:41:15.067
- Suzie.
- Take college, for instance.

01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:20.230
I bet the classes you took were ones
where the finals were multiple choice.

01:41:21.009 --> 01:41:24.672
And you never bought the book.
You'd find a girl to loan you hers.

01:41:24.846 --> 01:41:28.577
And then, of course, you'd have
to fuck her after that, right?

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.240
Is that how it went?

01:41:33.221 --> 01:41:34.688
Yeah.

01:41:37.058 --> 01:41:39.891
Well, I've got a good pop quiz for you.

01:41:40.061 --> 01:41:42.154
Multiple choice, of course.

01:41:43.498 --> 01:41:45.159
Before sailing on the Helios...

01:41:45.333 --> 01:41:50.930
...Medea killed King Creon
and the princess with what?

01:41:51.406 --> 01:41:53.033
A rock?

01:41:53.942 --> 01:41:55.671
A spear gun?

01:41:57.712 --> 01:41:59.270
Or a little poison?

01:42:00.148 --> 01:42:02.241
Poison!

01:42:06.054 --> 01:42:07.612
Good guess.

01:42:21.769 --> 01:42:23.498
Van Ryan got old.

01:42:24.105 --> 01:42:26.630
He and his cronies would come here.

01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:30.904
Hunt and whore.
They acted like a bunch of assholes.

01:42:31.279 --> 01:42:33.873
One trip, he showed up with this girl...

01:42:34.048 --> 01:42:37.313
...he'd picked up somewhere.

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:39.578
Gotten her pregnant.

01:42:40.622 --> 01:42:42.954
Dumped her in the swamp.

01:42:43.291 --> 01:42:45.259
Poor girl was dead in a year.

01:42:48.696 --> 01:42:52.530
That came with her.

01:42:53.134 --> 01:42:54.897
And the child?

01:42:55.069 --> 01:42:58.698
Well, she had it.
Before she drank herself to death.

01:43:00.241 --> 01:43:03.233
Wasn't exactly a love child.

01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:16.915
So you're not her grandmother.

01:43:18.026 --> 01:43:21.086
I raised her like I was.

01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:25.861
But, no. Walt was my only child.
He was a good boy.

01:43:26.034 --> 01:43:28.195
Until the Army took him.

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:31.930
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan
were half sisters.

01:43:32.473 --> 01:43:36.842
And the other girl, Kelly?
Suzie's niece.

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:51.582
Well, it may be good news or not.
I don't know. We'll start with the letter.

01:43:51.759 --> 01:43:55.251
- H.
- Yes, there are two H's.

01:44:18.653 --> 01:44:20.518
Nice truck.

01:44:28.496 --> 01:44:30.259
Selling your boat?

01:44:35.336 --> 01:44:37.634
This was Suzie's boat.

01:44:38.306 --> 01:44:40.797
Guess she won't be needing it now.

01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:46.671
Funny. I wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

01:44:49.050 --> 01:44:53.214
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her IQ was way up there.

01:44:53.388 --> 01:44:57.256
Around 200 or some such shit.

01:44:57.425 --> 01:45:00.917
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.

01:46:12.633 --> 01:46:14.328
Hi.

01:46:15.036 --> 01:46:16.901
What are you doing out here?

01:46:17.839 --> 01:46:20.103
I'm running away.

01:46:20.908 --> 01:46:23.069
You think that's wise?

01:46:25.913 --> 01:46:28.245
Guess what else?

01:46:31.285 --> 01:46:33.253
I have toys.

01:46:38.292 --> 01:46:40.419
I suppose one taste won't hurt.

01:46:51.906 --> 01:46:53.430
You know...

01:46:53.608 --> 01:46:57.100
...that weekend I got busted,
I called you about a hundred times.

01:47:01.783 --> 01:47:05.719
I really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

01:47:08.055 --> 01:47:09.352
Was I naive.

01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:15.920
I can't decide what came out better.

01:47:16.097 --> 01:47:21.467
That little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dildo shoved up her ass.

01:47:22.637 --> 01:47:25.128
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

01:47:39.454 --> 01:47:41.888
Seems to like the same places you do.

01:47:42.423 --> 01:47:46.985
- Funny you never met.
- Yeah, real funny.

01:47:47.161 --> 01:47:51.621
You know, you're wrong about this,
and I could get busted on the spot.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.264
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it.
Especially the part about killing me.

01:47:57.438 --> 01:48:00.896
Now, get out of here.
Go make yourself a new friend.

01:48:13.154 --> 01:48:15.315
What are you drinking?

01:48:19.393 --> 01:48:22.157
We gotta stop. I'm gonna come.

01:48:24.198 --> 01:48:27.429
That never seemed
to worry you at the glades.

01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:34.168
- That's not your line...
- Say you love me.

01:48:35.743 --> 01:48:39.839
I love you.
Now, give me the line.

01:48:40.014 --> 01:48:43.609
No little girl can ever make me come.

01:48:57.198 --> 01:49:01.294
You got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the evidence.

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.502
Oh, for chrissake.

01:49:23.558 --> 01:49:25.958
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

01:50:13.074 --> 01:50:14.974
May I ask you a question, Ms. Toller?

01:50:17.511 --> 01:50:20.674
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

01:50:23.384 --> 01:50:25.249
I hope I never make you mad.

01:50:29.190 --> 01:50:31.852
Cash is just walking-around money.

01:50:32.493 --> 01:50:34.688
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...

01:50:34.862 --> 01:50:37.330
...minus the million we set aside
for Ruby and Walter...

01:50:37.498 --> 01:50:39.159
...less my usual fee.

01:50:41.068 --> 01:50:42.729
Case closed.

01:50:54.915 --> 01:50:56.712
Suzie.

01:50:59.353 --> 01:51:01.344
Be good.
