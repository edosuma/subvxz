00:21.855 --> 00:23.880
What are you waiting for?
Call it!

00:30.230 --> 00:32.595
Come on, come on.
Coming through.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.339
Let me have a look.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.705
Okay, you're out.

00:42.742 --> 00:43.309
Myles will move in
from the second line.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.678
Forget about Myles.
I'm going back in.

00:45.678 --> 00:46.546
Stitch me.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.347
Terry, will you relax?

00:47.347 --> 00:50.009
It's a weekend league.
It's not the NHL.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.017
It is to me.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.678
You're not 100%.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.553
What are you,
a doctor or a coach? Do me a favor... stitch.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.926
Come on.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.406
All right, get up.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.533
Come on, fellas,
Back off.

01:49.242 --> 01:52.609
Everybody back.
Hey, Jackson!

01:52.779 --> 01:54.110
Come over here!

01:54.614 --> 01:55.849
He's hurt bad.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.441
Get the doc.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.191
Where's the body?

02:05.191 --> 02:06.759
On the bench.
He was moved there

02:06.759 --> 02:10.024
after he collapsed
in front of the net.

02:10.130 --> 02:10.430
Apparently, uh...

02:10.430 --> 02:12.132
the guy was
responsive enough

02:12.132 --> 02:13.299
to be helped off the ice.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.462
He died a few
minutes later.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.921
This looks fresh.
Well, according

02:34.921 --> 02:37.557
to the on-site doctor,
he took one across the cheek

02:37.557 --> 02:41.049
earlier in the second period.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
Well, I guess this must be from the third

02:43.163 --> 02:46.833
Looks like that other team worked him over

02:46.833 --> 02:48.767
Hockey... rough game.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.604
Yeah. It's murder.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.839
Two minutes
for elbowing.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.142
Four minutes
for high-sticking.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.644
Ten minutes,
unsportsmanlike conduct.

03:31.644 --> 03:32.712
Boys will be boys.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.048
Yeah. Sounds like these
boys went to a fight

03:35.048 --> 03:36.416
and a hockey game
broke out.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.450
You just don't like sports.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.119
That's not true.
I've been a baseball
fan my whole life.

03:40.119 --> 03:43.423
Baseball. Well, that
figures... all those stats.

03:43.423 --> 03:44.457
It's a beautiful game.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.960
Since when are you
interested in beauty?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.894
Since I met you.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.231
So, we'll start at
the opposite goal,

03:51.231 --> 03:55.068
work our way across
the blue line to center ice.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.797
Sure.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.857
It's not much to go on.

05:24.857 --> 05:28.384
Maybe we should be
looking off the ice.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.371
So, why did you
move the body?

05:38.371 --> 05:43.001
You ever tried
treating someone on the ice, wearing just

05:43.042 --> 05:45.010
Then Mr. Rivers
was still breathing?

05:45.044 --> 05:47.308
When I brought him back
to the bench, yes.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.316
Then I performed CPR,
and he didn't respond.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.319
Did you also do the stitch work?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
I'm the on-site doctor
for this facility.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.457
The stitches held,
and I advised Terry

05:57.457 --> 05:59.125
not to go back on the ice.

05:59.125 --> 06:03.323
So, if he'd listened,
he'd still be alive.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.401
What do these
guys play for?

06:08.401 --> 06:10.335
A little money?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.038
Imitation Stanley Cup?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.233
We play for
the pride of it.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.211
And the joy of kicking ass.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.145
You are...?

06:19.145 --> 06:21.013
Tommy Sconzo.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.715
Right wing, first line.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.081
Hitting's part
of the game.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.120
Take away the
physical aspect, you got figure skating...

06:27.120 --> 06:29.389
guys out there
doing triple lutzes.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.482
Is that how
you lost the, uh...?

06:32.125 --> 06:34.355
The sit spin?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.495
Second period, number nine. The guy's a

06:35.495 --> 06:39.363
Which means?
He gave me a high stick to the mouth.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.730
That's why my guys crashed
the goalie.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.064
An eye for an eye, you know?

06:42.101 --> 06:44.365
Is that why your
guy ended up dead?

06:47.206 --> 06:48.641
What can
I tell you, lady?

06:48.641 --> 06:51.906
It all happened
so fast, you know?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.636
Usually does.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.385
"There are three
things in life

07:01.421 --> 07:03.389
"that people like
to stare at...

07:03.423 --> 07:05.691
a rippling stream,
a fire in a fireplace

07:05.691 --> 07:08.694
and a Zamboni going
round and round."

07:08.694 --> 07:09.829
Charlie Brown.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.664
I love a Zamboni.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.791
We all do.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.336
The thing I love about Zambonis

07:50.336 --> 07:52.896
is they pick up everything.

07:54.373 --> 07:55.670
Hey.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.610
Yeah?

07:57.610 --> 08:02.377
I'm afraid the other part
of this tooth might be in there.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.319
Time to combine
Foyeer's Law of Conduction

08:06.319 --> 08:08.421
with Newton's Law of Cooling.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.290
Pile of ice measures nine feet

08:11.290 --> 08:12.814
by five feet...

08:14.994 --> 08:16.655
by...

08:18.231 --> 08:19.332
nine feet.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.703
Without the calculus,
I'd estimate...

08:23.703 --> 08:25.104
100 cubic feet.

08:25.104 --> 08:28.471
Current temperature,
one degree Celsius.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.476
The heaters max out at 90 degrees,

08:30.510 --> 08:32.477
but the variables are
constantly changing.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.173
Let's ballpark it.

08:34.212 --> 08:37.216
I don't know, 50-cubic-foot
melt per hour, if we're lucky?

08:37.216 --> 08:39.852
120 minutes for a tooth...

08:39.852 --> 08:41.153
the whole tooth...

08:41.153 --> 08:44.782
and nothing but the tooth.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.334
Whoo! There's a winner.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.302
Easy come, easy go.

08:59.038 --> 09:04.477
If I should die
this very moment

09:04.477 --> 09:08.681
I wouldn't fear

09:08.681 --> 09:13.886
For I've never known
completeness

09:13.886 --> 09:18.914
Like being here

09:20.092 --> 09:24.497
Wrapped in the warmth of you

09:24.497 --> 09:29.594
Loving every breath of you

09:30.703 --> 09:34.298
Still my heart this moment

09:35.575 --> 09:40.680
Oh, it might burst

09:40.680 --> 09:44.116
Could we stay right here

09:44.116 --> 09:47.153
To the end of time

09:47.153 --> 09:50.489
Till the earth stops
turning?

09:50.489 --> 09:52.592
Lockwood, Homicide.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.160
DFO's in the back.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.525
Lead the way.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.989
...seas run dry

10:01.601 --> 10:06.105
I've found the one

10:06.105 --> 10:13.136
I have waited for

10:15.147 --> 10:17.049
All this time...

10:17.049 --> 10:19.285
Stan Grevey, 35.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.019
Backup sax player.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.180
One of the waitresses
found him.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.630
Tiny scrubbing bubbles.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.299
Yeah, after somebody

10:33.299 --> 10:34.934
wiped them down.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.268
Paramedics?

10:36.268 --> 10:38.037
Nope.
Just pronounced, that's it.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.834
Just pronounced?

10:40.740 --> 10:43.009
Had an interesting diet.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.670
Cowhide.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.551
He tied himself off.

10:52.551 --> 10:53.419
Yup.

10:53.419 --> 10:54.687
All the signs

10:54.687 --> 10:56.555
of an OD...

10:56.555 --> 10:58.658
without any
of the paraphernalia.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.327
Your waitress say
anything about a needle,

11:01.327 --> 11:03.863
butane torch,
that sort of thing?

11:03.863 --> 11:04.563
No, not a word.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.233
Just said he reminded her
of Coltrane.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.724
Coltrane, huh?

11:10.870 --> 11:14.636
See if I can get this back
to Greggo at the lab.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.665
He could tell us
what we're dealing with.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.669
Two coasters, one glass?

11:22.014 --> 11:24.642
What do you think? Our guy was having a

11:24.684 --> 11:27.653
She was just coming on shift. She came
through me.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.822
Well,
somebody
was here...

11:29.822 --> 11:30.790
grabbed the stuff,

11:30.790 --> 11:32.917
took their glass.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.427
Forgot this on the way out.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.676
Safe bet the contact wasn't his.

11:50.743 --> 11:53.371
Hey, how's he doing?
Whoa, whoa...

11:53.446 --> 11:54.674
Miss, you can't come in here.
Why not?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.682
I'm sorry, he's dead.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.049
He's dead?
What are you talking about?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.677
They told me he wasn't
feeling well.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.687
He was backing
me up an hour ago.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.689
What happened to him?
Miss...

12:03.723 --> 12:06.055
Why don't we step outside
for a minute?

12:16.302 --> 12:18.437
What took you so long?

12:18.437 --> 12:20.239
I was watching
ice melt.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.741
Tox screen
came up empty

12:21.741 --> 12:22.575
except for quinine.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.705
Must have had malaria
in the past six months.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.408
Either that or he's a big
gin and tonic drinker.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.416
I've ordered up his
medical records.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.712
If I was this guy,

12:32.752 --> 12:34.481
I'd have been
pop ping pain pills.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.714
Hairline fracture
of the ulna,

12:36.756 --> 12:37.745
bruised kidney,

12:37.790 --> 12:39.792
ten stitches off
the orbital bone,

12:39.792 --> 12:42.090
fractured nasal bone,
all recent.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.996
Healed rib fractures.

12:43.996 --> 12:47.022
He should have worn a cage.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.538
I bet he was proud of every

12:52.538 --> 12:54.507
last battle scar.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.675
What is it
about organized sports?

12:56.675 --> 12:57.576
Well, organized sports

12:57.576 --> 12:59.445
is the paradigmatic model
of a just society.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.013
Everyone knows
the same language.

13:01.013 --> 13:01.981
Everyone knows the rules.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.784
And there's a specific
punishment handed out

13:04.784 --> 13:06.919
the moment someone tries
to cheat.

13:06.919 --> 13:07.820
It's instant morality.

13:07.820 --> 13:11.090
So, uh... what did this guy do
in real life?

13:11.090 --> 13:13.192
Stockbroker.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.027
Competition junky.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.295
Aren't we all?

13:16.295 --> 13:17.663
Not me. Not anymore.

13:17.663 --> 13:18.197
No?

13:18.197 --> 13:20.432
How'd you get to be
chief medical examiner?

13:20.432 --> 13:22.764
Look, we're all carrying

13:22.802 --> 13:24.770
prehistoric genes
in a postmodern world.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.772
We get our meat
from the grocery store

13:26.806 --> 13:28.774
instead of with a club
or a knife.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.876
We have to work off our,
uh... testosterone somehow.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.212
Foibles of youth.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.513
Yeah.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.348
So, cause of death?

13:36.348 --> 13:37.950
Not sure.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.442
This cut nicked his carotid.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.153
Double-edged, clean blade,
hockey skate, uh...

13:44.490 --> 13:46.788
could have killed him.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.157
Fun continues.

13:48.194 --> 13:51.493
Basilar artery also suffered significant

13:51.597 --> 13:53.792
Evidence of blood
in the intimal space.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.801
Possibly enough
to cause syncope.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.496
Loss of consciousness.

13:57.536 --> 13:58.798
Well, it could explain

13:58.838 --> 14:00.897
why the vic ended up
in the bottom of that pile.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.944
So, did his death cause his fall

14:04.944 --> 14:07.606
or did his fall cause his death?

14:12.017 --> 14:14.508
What'd you get from Area 51?

14:14.553 --> 14:17.089
Terry Rivers was
an instigator... always stirring the pot.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.490
Every fire needs a match.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.823
So, I guess this
is their equipment?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.829
Yeah, down to the last stick.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.524
Here's a copy of
the team roster.

14:25.564 --> 14:26.531
Okay.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.760
See you later.
Okay.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.438
Ms. Gallagher?

14:32.438 --> 14:33.837
Yeah.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.841
Catherine Willows Crime Lab.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.207
I understand you play
for Area 51.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.835
Did you see much ice time
during the game?

14:39.879 --> 14:43.838
No. They just let me take off my

14:43.883 --> 14:46.185
You know what?
Been there, done that.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.551
Just asking
a question here.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.187
I played 24 minutes,
12 seconds... about my season average.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.851
I also lead the team
in assist s.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.862
Oh... you've got
good peripheral vision.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.863
You see the ice
really well.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.865
I didn't see what
happened to Terry.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.867
You're a real teammate.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.869
Down the line,
just one of the guys.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.871
You're looking
in the wrong direction.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.567
Now, we may have
disliked Terry

15:08.607 --> 15:10.575
but his own teammates...

15:10.609 --> 15:11.610
hated him.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.412
Any reason why?

15:13.412 --> 15:16.609
How would I know?
I'm just a girl.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.116
Can I go now?

15:24.156 --> 15:26.681
Nice bike.

15:38.470 --> 15:42.474
Just getting into the mind
of a potential killer.

15:42.474 --> 15:43.275
Potential killer?

15:43.275 --> 15:46.011
Why don't you just
catch us up there, boss?

15:46.011 --> 15:47.813
In a minute.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.516
First things first...
your contact lens

15:50.516 --> 15:52.609
was worn by
a near-sighted person.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.915
And, since I was born
with perfect eyesight,

15:54.954 --> 15:57.923
I'm experimenting with what it would feel
like

15:57.957 --> 16:00.059
Don't tell us
you're wearing
our evidence.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.794
Come on, Greg.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.895
Give me some credit.

16:02.895 --> 16:07.566
Borrowing a pair
of lenses from
Archie in AV.

16:07.566 --> 16:11.058
Giving me a headache, though.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.598
Mannitol... that's
that baby laxative

16:18.644 --> 16:19.941
used to cut heroin with.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.310
China White?
You sure?

16:21.347 --> 16:23.782
The GCMS does not kid around.

16:23.782 --> 16:26.618
West coast heroin
is Mexican Brown.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.787
20%, 30% pure, tops.

16:28.787 --> 16:31.123
What's China White? 75%?

16:31.123 --> 16:32.818
Uh... your sample's 91.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.427
91%? No wonder the guy OD'd.

16:35.427 --> 16:37.896
That's a death sentence.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.955
Doesn't make any sense, man.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.627
The money from
dealing heroin comes
from the cutting.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.329
The more you cut,
the more money you make.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.964
There's no profit
margin in selling
stuff that's too pure.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.742
Unless you're looking
to kill someone.

16:49.742 --> 16:54.702
So, this is what being
a stockbroker buys you.

17:00.252 --> 17:03.455
Sighs
Hmm. Well...

17:03.455 --> 17:06.625
How do men live like this?

17:06.625 --> 17:09.261
What's wrong with it?

17:09.261 --> 17:13.298
Well, it's a cave

17:13.298 --> 17:15.601
with hardwood floors.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.636
It's clean.

17:17.636 --> 17:21.540
Television, couch.
What else does a guy need?

17:21.540 --> 17:22.907
Well, how about
a plant?

17:22.907 --> 17:26.244
Anything that makes it
a little more... human.

17:26.244 --> 17:30.306
I mean, it doesn't seem
like this guy had any...

17:31.050 --> 17:33.382
connection to anybody.

17:33.419 --> 17:36.320
I don't know about that.

17:54.640 --> 18:00.279
It's never a good sign
when the number of women

18:00.279 --> 18:02.881
a guy sleeps with is greater

18:02.881 --> 18:05.717
than the number
of chairs he owns.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.252
So, what's the ratio here?

18:07.252 --> 18:10.489
Well, uh, ballparking it,
I'd say...

18:10.489 --> 18:16.295
four women to every one piece
of furniture he owns,

18:16.295 --> 18:18.530
including the TV.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.898
(sighs)
So...

18:19.898 --> 18:24.903
I guess our guy is
about three things...

18:24.903 --> 18:27.167
pucks, bucks, and...

18:28.373 --> 18:29.041
chicks.

18:29.041 --> 18:32.611
Well, we still don't know
how or why he died.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.978
Well, we know how he lived.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.085
Any blood?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.122
Take your pick.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.090
Testing for blood
on a hockey jersey

18:45.124 --> 18:48.093
is like handing out
jaywalking tickets
at a marathon.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.425
Well, speaking
on a meta -level...

18:50.462 --> 18:52.197
Isn't it obvious?

18:52.197 --> 18:54.633
The overbearing
patriarchal structure

18:54.633 --> 18:56.835
of modern organized
sports represents

18:56.835 --> 19:00.339
a socially palatable sublimation of what
Jung refers to

19:00.339 --> 19:02.674
as the "shadows
of the unconscious."

19:02.674 --> 19:04.343
You sucked
at team sports, huh?

19:04.343 --> 19:07.369
I was captain of
the high school
chess squad.

19:08.380 --> 19:12.180
Chess is not
a sport, Greg.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.056
Then why is there
a world chess champion?

19:18.056 --> 19:23.119
I think sports are
physical by definition.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.823
Well, sex is physical.

19:24.863 --> 19:25.964
Is that a sport?

19:25.964 --> 19:27.829
Not to me.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.939
These blades skated

19:33.939 --> 19:36.669
through the blood pool.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.422
Blood spatter.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.791
Good guess...
this is the one

19:52.791 --> 19:54.693
that did the damage.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.695
You know, I had
a roommate in college

19:56.695 --> 19:59.598
freshman year, from Edmonton,
went on to play

19:59.598 --> 20:01.066
for the Swedish
Elite League.

20:01.066 --> 20:03.159
Anyways, he set his blade

20:03.202 --> 20:04.863
at half an inch, tops.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.805
I should know, because
he made me get them sharpened.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.308
These blades are probably
set at a quarter of an inch.

20:09.308 --> 20:13.045
Well, that's as sharp
as it gets.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.346
It's a tough blade
to skate on.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.081
We're talking
Wayne Gretzky style.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.345
And deadly in a fight.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.188
Yeah, that victim
was out of L.A.,

20:31.230 --> 20:32.219
and I don't think
the singer, Lillie,

20:33.232 --> 20:34.800
met him before last night,
so she may be in the clear.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.470
Sure you don't want to start
in the dressing room?

20:38.470 --> 20:39.538
(chuckles)
Right...

20:39.538 --> 20:42.341
like you're going
to take Dumpster duty alone.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.643
Hey, just 'cause I've been
on a personal losing streak

20:44.643 --> 20:47.112
with the ladies doesn't mean
you should be, too.

20:47.112 --> 20:49.815
Man, I don't even know if I'm going to go

20:49.815 --> 20:52.384
The odds haven't gone my way
in a
long
time.

20:52.384 --> 20:55.387
I'm talking about chicks,
not gambling.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.116
Same difference.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.917
Mind if I go for her, then?

21:14.873 --> 21:15.965
Warrick.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.321
It's mine...

21:29.321 --> 21:32.891
but anybody could have lifted this scarf from

21:32.891 --> 21:35.927
It's still yours.

21:35.927 --> 21:38.259
You trying to pin this
on me now?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.958
We're just doing
our jobs here.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.262
Well, did you find
my fingerprints on anything?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.962
We won't know
till we print you.

21:44.002 --> 21:47.403
Oh, I'm not worried.
What you see is what you get.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.270
You're putting words
in my mouth.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.939
You said everybody hated
him... now we know why.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.278
We opened up
Terry's hard drive.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.284
It turns out he had
your entire roster

21:59.318 --> 22:00.307
knee-deep in the stock market.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.020
I don't play for the Rat Pack.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.055
Not now...

22:03.055 --> 22:03.889
but you used to.

22:03.889 --> 22:07.290
Okay, so I changed teams.
Big deal. I wanted to win.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.294
The fact that Terry Rivers
churned and burned

22:09.328 --> 22:11.897
your brokerage account
out of ten grand... that didn't enter into it?

22:11.897 --> 22:12.764
Terry was a stockbroker.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.995
He did really well for himself...
Rolex, Beemer.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.296
Said he could
do the same for me.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.303
I gave him some money.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.635
If I wasn't willing to take a risk, I'd have put it
in a bank.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.299
You weren't the only one,
were you?

22:22.341 --> 22:25.010
No. All the guys
had money with him.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.307
I mean, Terry
was a salesman.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.347
You listen to him
talk for five minutes,

22:28.347 --> 22:29.581
your hair was on fire.

22:29.581 --> 22:30.615
Ms. Gallagher,
your skate

22:30.615 --> 22:32.417
had a certain
blood spatter on it.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.086
It indicates that you're the one

22:34.086 --> 22:36.888
that nicked Terry River's carotid artery.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.856
Look, it was pileup.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.322
Everything was a blur.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.329
That's ten guys with blades on.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.024
Hey, I was just looking out
for myself.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.326
He was a stationary target.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.468
Terry was on the bottom of all those

22:49.468 --> 22:50.302
Like you said,

22:50.302 --> 22:51.503
- nobody saw anything.
- Including

22:51.503 --> 22:55.337
your skate intentionally
coming down on his neck.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.363
Oh, God.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.244
You okay?

22:59.244 --> 23:00.178
You all right?

23:00.178 --> 23:07.346
I knew I shouldn't have had
that shrimp salad for dinner last night.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.914
If you'll excuse me, I'll get that cleaned up.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.395
Wait. You're not going to...

23:16.395 --> 23:18.163
What are you doing?

23:18.163 --> 23:20.198
It's evidence.

23:20.198 --> 23:20.966
Food poisoning...

23:20.966 --> 23:23.135
especially anything
with spoiled mayonnaise...

23:23.135 --> 23:25.237
can induce vomiting
within 15 minutes.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.240
She said last night...
that was 12 hours ago.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.367
Do what
you got to do.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.451
She's a liar, and a mother.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.153
Morning sickness?

23:41.153 --> 23:42.087
Yep.

23:42.087 --> 23:42.988
And you know this how?

23:42.988 --> 23:46.258
Well, first, I tested for
the presence of shellfish...

23:46.258 --> 23:47.025
crustacean -free.

23:47.025 --> 23:48.960
And then I figured,
if she's hiding that,

23:48.960 --> 23:50.393
what else is she hiding?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.063
Little lie, big lie.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.698
There was blood in the sample.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.394
Not uncommon
in early pregnancy.

23:56.435 --> 24:00.394
Women get mucosal tears in their

24:00.772 --> 24:04.401
So, I tested the blood for the presence of
human

24:04.443 --> 24:06.638
She is definitely with child.

24:06.678 --> 24:08.213
She wasn't showing.
She's skinny as a rail.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.381
But...

24:09.381 --> 24:11.783
still, why lie about it?

24:11.783 --> 24:13.885
Maybe she didn't know
she was pregnant.

24:13.885 --> 24:16.421
If she had, would she
have gone out on the ice?

24:16.421 --> 24:18.223
I wonder if
she would know

24:18.223 --> 24:20.392
who the father
is...or was.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.760
Well, if it was Terry Rivers,

24:21.760 --> 24:24.296
he was definitely
deadbeat dad material.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.389
Which speaks to motive.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.532
It's enough to
get us a warrant.

24:27.532 --> 24:31.332
Except you can't
safely test for paternity before the baby's
born.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.132
We could search Jane
Gallagher's apartment.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.442
See if Terry Rivers might
have left anything behind.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.945
Yeah. Say good-bye to Greg.

24:39.945 --> 24:42.505
Bye, Greg.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.784
I've got twins here, Bill...
one set of prints

24:45.784 --> 24:47.445
from your work card;
another set

24:47.486 --> 24:50.819
from the drug paraphernalia
we found in the Dumpster.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.123
Look, what can I say?

24:52.123 --> 24:53.425
He's got a son.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.793
Well, that's fine.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.061
That's not
the issue.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.996
You tamper ed with the evidence.

24:57.996 --> 24:58.864
He's eight years old.

24:58.864 --> 25:02.300
I didn't want Stan's son to hear
that he died in a lounge...

25:02.300 --> 25:04.069
foam coming out of his mouth,

25:04.069 --> 25:05.468
a needle in his arm.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.233
That's too much for a boy.

25:07.272 --> 25:09.172
Yeah, but you
got him the gig.

25:09.207 --> 25:12.077
- You didn't know he was a junkie? - So am

25:12.077 --> 25:13.044
Former.

25:13.044 --> 25:14.679
Hell, we met in AA.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.014
I thought he was clean.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.350
I got my fourth birthday
coming up.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.318
Could have lost your job.

25:20.318 --> 25:22.153
Besides, Lillie's going places.

25:22.153 --> 25:23.889
You know, she's on her way up.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.857
I want to be along for the ride.

25:25.857 --> 25:31.196
So you cleaned him up,
threw away his works...

25:31.196 --> 25:32.264
Why Lillie's scarf?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.198
I grabbed the first thing
I could find.

25:34.232 --> 25:35.256
Lillie's scarf was there?

25:35.300 --> 25:36.601
Yeah.
Really?

25:36.601 --> 25:39.502
You mind rolling up
your sleeves for us?

25:49.781 --> 25:51.883
I've always had good veins.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.477
Yeah, okay.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.188
Thanks.

25:57.188 --> 26:00.659
Hey, one more thing, Bill.

26:00.659 --> 26:02.127
You wear contacts?

26:02.127 --> 26:03.161
Not anymore.

26:03.161 --> 26:04.129
Lasik surgery.

26:04.129 --> 26:05.931
How's that working out for you?

26:05.931 --> 26:07.228
Great.

26:07.265 --> 26:09.233
One less thing I'm dependent on.

26:45.837 --> 26:46.905
No, no, no, no.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.566
Don't stop.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.576
I don't like playing in front of an audience.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.601
It's just me.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.580
What, are you uncomfortable in
front of strangers or something?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.583
No, I just came by to
ask you a few questions,

26:58.617 --> 27:00.585
and I got a little
carried away.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.484
Oh.

27:03.488 --> 27:05.581
Well, if you keep playing,

27:05.624 --> 27:07.922
I'll keep talking.

27:23.208 --> 27:28.713
So, um... how well
do you know these
people you play with?

27:28.713 --> 27:29.614
Oh...

27:29.614 --> 27:32.014
well enough.

27:37.188 --> 27:38.223
Who is this?

27:38.223 --> 27:40.158
I thought I was the one

27:40.158 --> 27:44.094
asking questions here.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.161
Warrick Brown.

27:50.802 --> 27:52.736
Lillie Ivers.

27:53.438 --> 27:56.965
So, I guess we're not
strangers anymore.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.949
Maybe you should come by later...

28:04.949 --> 28:08.009
so we can talk some more.

28:10.755 --> 28:13.656
Well,
Jane may play hockey,

28:13.692 --> 28:16.661
but her sheets
are distinctly female.

28:16.661 --> 28:18.863
There are semen
stains everywhere.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.165
Not very
Victoria Secret.

28:20.165 --> 28:23.935
What is Victoria's secret,
I wonder?

28:23.935 --> 28:26.171
Beauty, Grissom.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.900
Remember?

28:43.254 --> 28:46.591
Sheets may be female,
but this toenail

28:46.591 --> 28:47.683
belonged to a man.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.058
With all the sex these people are having,

28:50.095 --> 28:52.689
maybe I should
take up hockey.

28:56.835 --> 28:59.370
I told you what I make.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.840
What do you bring in?

29:01.840 --> 29:03.007
50, 60 a year?

29:03.007 --> 29:04.509
So, that's what you're all about?

29:04.509 --> 29:07.112
No, that's what
the business is all about.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.613
Then run.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.248
Hmm.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.706
I just thought that,
with your kind of talent,

29:13.752 --> 29:15.720
you know,
I could dial you in.2

29:15.754 --> 29:19.713
I've got a manager with a pipeline to God.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.724
Sounds like you're pretty dependent on

29:23.762 --> 29:27.198
I've been booked solid
for the past two years.

29:27.198 --> 29:31.936
Next stop...
Blue Note, Motown...

29:31.936 --> 29:32.937
anything I want.

29:32.937 --> 29:36.541
Studio time,
recording contracts...

29:36.541 --> 29:37.108
Great.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.407
I'm a musician, Warrick,
and I recognize talent.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.749
And the way you look...

29:44.783 --> 29:47.081
you might as well
be dipped in gold.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.745
I don't know
about all that.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.255
What are you holding back for?

29:52.123 --> 29:54.793
You could be out there
making a difference.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.529
I already do
make a difference.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.230
Yeah, riding around
chasing ghosts

29:59.230 --> 30:00.498
with that partner of yours.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.233
Nobody even knows you exist.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.929
You do.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.173
Show time.

30:08.173 --> 30:09.641
We're back.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.302
Okay.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.612
Okay, so...

30:14.612 --> 30:16.080
Knock 'em dead.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.071
I'll try.

30:46.911 --> 30:47.545
Catherine...

30:47.545 --> 30:50.810
you seen any guys
with a broken tooth lately?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.146
Yeah, I saw
ten of them.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.480
Yeah, well, one of them
is your suspect.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.815
I got your page.
What's the big news?

30:54.853 --> 30:57.789
Oh, that tooth that you found at
the bottom of the snow pile...

30:57.789 --> 30:58.656
You got a match.
To what?

30:58.656 --> 31:00.491
To the nasty-ass toenail
that Sara found.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.827
What? I thought it
belonged to the dead guy.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.295
No, it belongs to a live guy.

31:04.295 --> 31:05.563
So, what you're
saying is

31:05.563 --> 31:07.165
whoever was in
Jane Gallagher's bed

31:07.165 --> 31:10.602
was on the ice
the night that
Terry Rivers died.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.830
Goal.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.861
It's a temp.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.838
What about the girl?
Is she a temp, too?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.845
You know, I treated Jane better
than that mutt Rivers ever did.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.847
And it never
cost her a cent.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.849
Is that why
you hated Terry?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.851
He was on my short list, yeah.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.386
You know, I got a list.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.844
It's got a negative figure
of 12,000 after your name.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.851
Well, money's kind
of like my tooth.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.554
It don't grow back.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.855
Did you ever hear
the story of the 19th century

31:38.897 --> 31:40.865
Chinese goldsmith?

31:40.899 --> 31:44.858
He lost a lot of money for his
goldsmith buddies due to his
shoddy business practices,

31:44.903 --> 31:46.871
so they decided to kill him

31:46.905 --> 31:49.040
by biting him to death.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.838
123 goldsmiths took a bite
out of the victim,

31:51.910 --> 31:54.879
insuring that no one individual
could be blamed for the murder.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.348
For who would know which one
administered

31:57.348 --> 31:59.651
You're the captain
of the Rat Pack.

31:59.651 --> 32:00.952
You make it so everyone
gets a shot in,

32:00.952 --> 32:04.911
and no one takes the blame.
It's a win-win situation.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.922
Well, that's a nice little bedtime story for

32:07.959 --> 32:09.893
but it doesn't have a lick of truth.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.129
Well, there's
truth in this:

32:11.129 --> 32:14.895
Your friend Jane
is pregnant.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.359
I'm going to be a dad?

32:20.305 --> 32:22.440
What kind
of coronary anomaly?

32:22.440 --> 32:25.898
Wolff-Parkinson
- White Syndrome.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.912
Interferes with the heart's
electrical system.

32:27.946 --> 32:28.935
I never heard of it.

32:28.980 --> 32:32.784
Well, it didn't show during
the post, but I looked at the tissue
sections in histopath.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.385
They showed a small defect

32:34.385 --> 32:37.479
in the atrium of the heart.

32:39.757 --> 32:42.260
So, the game had nothing
to do with it?

32:42.260 --> 32:43.294
It was the heart?

32:43.294 --> 32:44.062
Not necessarily.

32:44.062 --> 32:46.965
You know the quinine
I found in his system?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.934
Lethal for someone
with W.P.W.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.936
Big scars didn't
do him in.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.938
It was the little scar.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.941
Someone still gets an assist.

33:05.550 --> 33:06.949
Hey, Sara.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.976
You come up here
on your nights off,

33:09.020 --> 33:10.989
people are going
to start confusing
the two of you.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.923
You're here.

33:15.293 --> 33:17.061
What's up?

33:17.061 --> 33:18.429
New lead.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.124
The bartender.

33:20.932 --> 33:21.799
Purple.

33:21.799 --> 33:23.960
Marquis Mecke Froede.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.970
Test for opiates.

33:34.645 --> 33:35.380
Purple.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.974
You know
what that means.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.988
The coasters test
positive for heroin.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.318
He was dealing
from behind the bar.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.695
He sandwiched the drugs
between the coasters.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.684
That's how he hid it.

33:51.729 --> 33:54.699
When we found those two coasters in Stan
Grevey's

33:54.699 --> 33:56.690
we assumed that
there was two people...

33:56.734 --> 33:59.137
either a user or supplier. There weren't.

33:59.137 --> 34:02.163
Just our guy...
the victim.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.044
What's wrong?

34:06.044 --> 34:10.913
He wasn't the only one
with two coasters, man.

34:11.815 --> 34:12.750
What do you mean?

34:12.750 --> 34:16.621
Remember when we talked
to Lillie about the scarf?

34:16.621 --> 34:17.588
Yeah.

34:17.588 --> 34:19.524
She had a drink

34:19.524 --> 34:21.359
with two coasters.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.054
So what?

34:23.094 --> 34:24.728
There could be
a hundred reasons why she...

34:24.728 --> 34:26.563
Did you
not hear me? She might be involved.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.725
You got to walk away from this fast.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.427
We got the dealer...
the bartender.

34:30.467 --> 34:32.732
- Let's just take him out. - And we will.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.005
- What about her? - What about her?

34:35.005 --> 34:36.996
Why don't you...

34:37.408 --> 34:39.739
Why don't you just
let me handle my business?

34:39.811 --> 34:42.041
Then handle it.

34:47.185 --> 34:50.052
We were in the sack...

34:50.088 --> 34:52.056
right in
the middle of it.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.025
Next thing I know, he stopped...

34:54.025 --> 34:56.050
How do I say this?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.296
- He stopped... - Doing it?

34:58.296 --> 34:59.230
Yes. Thank you.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.598
His face
was flushed.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.065
He was sweating.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.295
It was all good,
and then he just...

35:07.538 --> 35:11.065
went soft and passed out.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.145
I was scared. I called the team doctor.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.079
The paramedics came

35:15.079 --> 35:16.614
and rushed him
to the E.R.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.783
You know we got
his medical records.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.351
Let me ask you
a question.

35:20.351 --> 35:21.119
When Terry came to,

35:21.119 --> 35:23.855
did he tell you what
had happened to him?

35:23.855 --> 35:25.690
He didn't tell
me anything.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.391
Neither did
the doctors.

35:27.391 --> 35:28.459
I wasn't family.

35:28.459 --> 35:29.627
What did you do?

35:29.627 --> 35:30.361
Took off.

35:30.361 --> 35:33.057
I didn't want
anybody to know
I'd been with him.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.100
Worried that the father
of your child

35:36.100 --> 35:38.796
might find out?

35:43.341 --> 35:45.843
I was sleeping with Terry,

35:45.843 --> 35:47.778
but I was dating Tommy.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.615
And what's the difference?

35:50.615 --> 35:51.782
Terry was a bad boy.

35:51.782 --> 35:54.986
The kind of guy you just
can't get out of your system.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.786
Who's on your mind
all the time.

35:59.157 --> 36:03.116
He used to drive my friends crazy.

36:03.161 --> 36:07.188
Tommy... husband material.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.335
So we just double-checked
the search warrant

36:11.335 --> 36:13.004
returned from Terry Rivers' apartment.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.039
There was no quinine
found in the location.

36:15.039 --> 36:18.133
He never had
a prescription
for quinine.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.411
Well, according to Doc Robbins, he never

36:20.411 --> 36:23.314
Do you have
his medical file?

36:23.314 --> 36:24.248
Yeah.

36:24.248 --> 36:25.483
Let me see it.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.051
Right here.
Thanks.

36:27.051 --> 36:30.321
So Jane Gallagher is officially no longer a

36:30.321 --> 36:34.125
Didn't have access to quinine, let alone

36:34.125 --> 36:35.059
So who did know?

36:35.059 --> 36:36.627
Terry was
a roughneck.

36:36.627 --> 36:37.361
He dished it out,

36:37.361 --> 36:40.131
so the other players
dished it out harder.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.299
Which they wouldn't have done

36:41.299 --> 36:42.833
if they had known
about his heart.

36:42.833 --> 36:44.468
They would have
played tentatively.

36:44.468 --> 36:47.405
Which, in hockey,
is a sacrilege.

36:47.405 --> 36:50.169
Someone besides Terry
had to know.

36:50.641 --> 36:52.632
Somebody did.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.646
You can withhold
medical information from your friends all

36:55.646 --> 36:58.382
but it's still going to be in your hospital

36:58.382 --> 37:02.785
Anyone with access to Terry's medical
records

37:03.688 --> 37:06.924
How many patients do you have
with malaria?

37:06.924 --> 37:08.926
I'm an orthopedist. None.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.596
Not according to the pharmacy in your

37:11.596 --> 37:13.831
Last month, you wrote a prescription for

37:13.831 --> 37:16.767
an anti-malaria
medication.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.937
Malaria in Las Vegas. No wonder they were

37:19.937 --> 37:21.939
Look, a friend of mine
was going to Africa.

37:21.939 --> 37:24.203
I did him a favor.
That's it.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.233
Now, is there a crime in that?

37:26.577 --> 37:30.911
Well... a man is dead.

37:34.352 --> 37:37.219
It hurts getting stitched.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.916
It hurts even more when you get home.

37:38.956 --> 37:41.220
I always give the guys
something for the pain.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.227
So you're
the go-to guy?

37:43.261 --> 37:46.330
I am the on-site doctor
for this facility.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.432
Nothing more and nothing less.

37:48.432 --> 37:51.924
Is this Umbria or Tuscany?

37:52.203 --> 37:53.704
Italy.

37:53.704 --> 37:55.433
That's pretty serious.

37:57.875 --> 38:00.811
But Jane's had a couple
of boyfriends

38:00.811 --> 38:02.972
since that trip,
right?

38:14.158 --> 38:18.254
Terry was an injury waiting to happen,

38:18.296 --> 38:20.231
And, when it did,

38:20.231 --> 38:21.232
you were there on the bench

38:21.232 --> 38:24.258
with two little pills
in your hand.

38:33.277 --> 38:34.745
So what?

38:34.745 --> 38:37.048
So what if I gave him quinine?

38:37.048 --> 38:38.582
It's like giving
a candy bar to
a diabetic

38:38.582 --> 38:40.084
if you know he's a diabetic.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.652
And you knew, Doctor.

38:41.652 --> 38:44.985
Terry Rivers had
a heart condition.

38:48.826 --> 38:49.827
I need you.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.128
Oh, yeah? Since when?

38:51.128 --> 38:53.564
Look, we tried it out. It didn't work.

38:53.564 --> 38:54.332
We're friends.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.267
I don't want the whole
world to know

38:56.267 --> 38:58.292
that I've been with Terry.

38:59.937 --> 39:01.370
Please?

39:02.540 --> 39:05.676
Okay, okay.
I'll stay with Terry.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.446
You were always
cleaning up her messes,

39:08.446 --> 39:09.380
weren't you,
Doctor?

39:09.380 --> 39:12.516
Jane told us that
she paid you a visit
a couple of days ago.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.686
She thought she had the flu... but she didn't.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.188
She's pregnant.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.057
And, with the father out of the way,

39:20.057 --> 39:22.860
you knew who she
would turn to.

39:22.860 --> 39:26.921
But Tommy Sconzo
is the father.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.803
You killed the wrong guy.

39:36.807 --> 39:40.072
Let's take
a little drive.

39:54.692 --> 39:55.426
You nearsighted?

39:55.426 --> 39:59.362
I bet this is going
to match the contact lens

39:59.397 --> 40:01.388
we found at
the crime scene, isn't it?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.602
Let me ask you
another question.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.871
Why deal 91% pure
China White?

40:06.871 --> 40:10.474
Did you have a beef with the victim, or

40:10.474 --> 40:12.376
I never met the guy.

40:12.376 --> 40:15.379
You're going to have to do better than that.

40:15.379 --> 40:19.784
You intentionally sold him stuff
that was too pure.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.852
We know he's not
the only guy
you dealt it to.

40:21.852 --> 40:26.380
Look, I didn't mean to
harm anybody, all right?

40:26.424 --> 40:29.026
I didn't know what I was cutting. Probably

40:29.026 --> 40:30.995
Bad batch?

40:30.995 --> 40:34.565
Hey, do yourself
a favor, slick.

40:34.565 --> 40:37.435
If you don't know enough
about something,

40:37.435 --> 40:38.502
stay out of it.

40:38.502 --> 40:40.471
It's too late
for that.

40:40.471 --> 40:41.995
Yeah.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.647
You want to talk about it?

40:49.647 --> 40:51.482
No.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.983
Okay.

40:52.983 --> 40:55.417
I'm going to meet Lillie.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.444
I'll see you back
at the lab.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.781
You don't know me.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.332
Obviously.

41:08.332 --> 41:11.597
You hiding from me?

41:13.137 --> 41:15.706
You looking for me?

41:15.706 --> 41:16.807
Yeah.

41:16.807 --> 41:19.777
I wanted to talk to you.

41:19.777 --> 41:22.012
Oh, yeah?

41:22.012 --> 41:24.845
About what?

41:27.818 --> 41:28.552
Come on, tell me.

41:28.552 --> 41:31.646
We're not strangers
anymore, remember?

41:33.257 --> 41:35.122
Yeah, you're right.

41:37.695 --> 41:40.163
Warrick Brown.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.192
What?

41:55.145 --> 41:58.376
I'm sorry, Lillie.

42:00.684 --> 42:04.245
Life's too short.

42:06.657 --> 42:09.148
Good-bye.

43:29.106 --> 43:31.308
What are you doing here?

43:31.308 --> 43:33.708
I'm playing cards...

43:35.679 --> 43:38.045
with my friend.

43:39.305 --> 43:45.403
