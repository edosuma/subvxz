00:06.999 --> 00:11.602
That house changed every aspect of
my life and my children's lives.

00:11.603 --> 00:16.463
And it changed us to the
core of who we are.

00:18.444 --> 00:22.213
They obviously prepared
the bodies in this room.

00:22.214 --> 00:27.452
I've never in my life seen stuff
like I saw in this house, never.

00:27.453 --> 00:30.588
There was something tormenting my son.

00:30.589 --> 00:32.189
[ Smack ]

00:32.191 --> 00:33.825
[Screaming]

00:33.826 --> 00:36.646
Thy will be done!

00:36.829 --> 00:40.832
I thought, this thing is trying to kill me.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.334
It wants me dead.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.615

01:05.024 --> 01:08.259
Back in 1987, I had a wonderful life.

01:08.260 --> 01:11.526
I lived in a little small
town in upstate New York...

01:11.527 --> 01:15.007
Uh, with my husband, Alan...

01:15.801 --> 01:17.335
My four children...

01:17.336 --> 01:21.476
Brad, my daughter Jennifer, and A.J.

01:21.898 --> 01:25.410
And then there was the oldest, Philip.

01:25.411 --> 01:27.412
He was very mischievous.

01:27.413 --> 01:30.074
They all idolized him.
He was the big brother.

01:30.075 --> 01:34.967
They played baseball and lived normal
life riding bicycles out front.

01:34.968 --> 01:39.768
And uh, it was just a
nice, slow-paced life.

01:42.961 --> 01:48.541
There was nothing that I thought
could destroy our lives.

01:51.651 --> 01:54.231
[Phone ringing]

01:56.075 --> 01:57.862
- Philip was 13.
- Hello.

01:57.863 --> 02:03.683
And I noticed a small lump at
the low portion of his neck.

02:05.184 --> 02:07.944
- Baby. - [Crying]

02:09.821 --> 02:15.721
It turned out the cancer was very serious.
It was Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

02:15.976 --> 02:20.680
Unfortunately, we had found that there was
no childhood cancer treatment centers,

02:20.681 --> 02:22.200
in the area where we lived.

02:22.201 --> 02:27.605
And we had to go to Hartford, Connecticut,
which was 300 miles round-trip a day.

02:27.606 --> 02:32.131
And we were making that
trip five times a week.

02:32.132 --> 02:34.352
[Retching]

02:35.681 --> 02:37.252
The treatment was new.

02:37.253 --> 02:40.585
And it was very radical
and very aggressive.

02:40.586 --> 02:46.486
The radiation was so intense that it
burned his skin and turned it black.

02:49.190 --> 02:53.965
Just going back and forth was
taking such a toll on his body

02:53.966 --> 02:58.936
with the headaches and the nausea and the
body aches that this child was suffering.

02:58.937 --> 03:04.442
And I can't reach around and comfort
him or hug him or hold him.

03:04.443 --> 03:06.663
[Coughing]

03:07.580 --> 03:12.514
I was afraid that the trip
itself was gonna kill Philip...

03:20.092 --> 03:22.827
to Connecticut to be near his doctors.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.229
Okay?

03:24.230 --> 03:27.432
It was very difficult to find a
place to live in Connecticut.

03:27.433 --> 03:31.068
I looked at everything in the
papers and called every realtor.

03:31.069 --> 03:34.337
But they said that they didn't rent to
anyone with more than two children.

03:34.338 --> 03:36.141
Okay, bye-bye.

03:36.142 --> 03:39.598
So I was gonna take this
town house regardless,

03:39.599 --> 03:43.439
even though it was sight unseen.

03:45.817 --> 03:49.717
It was our last resort basically.

03:51.223 --> 03:52.557
I begged Al.

03:52.558 --> 03:55.226
And I said, please, please,
please, go in and check.

03:55.227 --> 03:57.621
- See if it's okay.
- What? No, come on.

03:57.622 --> 03:59.826
- Mar'.
- No. Go. Go on.

03:59.827 --> 04:01.867
Please.

04:04.281 --> 04:10.181
So now I'm chewing my nails,
waiting on him to come back out.

04:10.343 --> 04:12.392
He was gone about 15 minutes.

04:12.393 --> 04:14.313
What?

04:15.390 --> 04:17.610
Come see.

04:19.485 --> 04:22.965
And we go into the house...

04:25.324 --> 04:27.458
And everything looks pretty normal.

04:27.459 --> 04:30.459
[Floorboards creaking]

04:30.696 --> 04:36.596
But then I started noticing above every
entrance way, there was a crucifix.

04:43.008 --> 04:46.188
It was a funeral home.

04:48.374 --> 04:54.014
I think the word, oh, my God.
Came out many, many times.

04:56.188 --> 05:00.688
Then Alan took me down into the basement.

05:03.343 --> 05:08.623
There was a counter that ran
around the three walls.

05:10.068 --> 05:14.508
There was another room off to the right.

05:20.178 --> 05:22.758
[Door creaking]

05:25.384 --> 05:28.586
They obviously prepared
the bodies in this room.

05:28.587 --> 05:31.227
[Water plunking]

05:43.402 --> 05:47.772
And I thought, oh, my God,
this is an embalming machine.

05:47.773 --> 05:52.813
This... This had people's
fluids going through it.

06:00.118 --> 06:04.555
When I turned around, I
could see this lift.

06:04.556 --> 06:07.076
[Door squeaks]

06:10.028 --> 06:15.414
I realized that that lift was
what they put the coffins on

06:15.415 --> 06:19.615
and lifted them up through the floor.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.230
[Chain clanks]

06:30.081 --> 06:33.621
[Chain rattling and clanging]

06:36.355 --> 06:38.395
[Sighs]

06:39.124 --> 06:42.360
And I looked at Al, and I said,
we have a son that has cancer.

06:42.361 --> 06:45.380
I don't want him thinking
about his own mortality.

06:45.381 --> 06:46.798
We cannot live here.

06:46.799 --> 06:48.700
And he said, we've got no choice.

06:48.701 --> 06:51.135
Our savings are gone.

06:51.136 --> 06:53.170
Our resources are gone.

06:53.171 --> 06:55.631
We're stuck.

06:58.544 --> 07:04.114
And I decided I would do the best I
could and I would make it a home

07:04.115 --> 07:10.015
and try to keep it from the children
that it was a funeral home.

07:13.425 --> 07:17.762
I remember, I was really excited
because of the size of the house.

07:17.763 --> 07:19.397
It was humongous.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.966
And I thought to myself, wow,
this is like a palace.

07:21.967 --> 07:25.147
This is like a castle.

07:31.309 --> 07:35.946
Al had to return directly
back to New York to work.

07:35.947 --> 07:39.316
I had to continue with Phil's treatments

07:39.317 --> 07:43.755
and then try to get the
house settled on my own.

07:43.756 --> 07:47.091
I decided to put Philip
in the basement room.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.360
It was right next to the bathroom.

07:49.361 --> 07:52.430
He was still suffering with a
lot of nausea and vomiting.

07:52.431 --> 07:57.435
I could keep my ears open so I
could hear when he needed me.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.436
[Light switch clicks]

08:02.508 --> 08:04.475
[Crickets chirping]

08:04.476 --> 08:08.746
The very first night we stayed there,
Philip went downstairs to his bed.

08:08.747 --> 08:11.248
He was totally wiped.

08:11.249 --> 08:13.829
[Clock ticking]

08:15.186 --> 08:17.488
No. I was on the phone with Al.

08:17.489 --> 08:18.489
[Laughs]

08:18.490 --> 08:20.124
Don't be ridiculous.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.705
[Clock ticking]

08:23.295 --> 08:27.015
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

08:32.414 --> 08:35.559
I was explaining how the day had
gone and what was going on.

08:35.561 --> 08:39.802
I'll probably check on
Philip a little later.

08:39.803 --> 08:43.342
[Distorted whispering] Philip.

08:43.448 --> 08:46.029
[Clock ticking]

08:52.691 --> 08:54.551
Hmm.

08:55.193 --> 08:58.818
No, Philip's got to start school again.

08:58.819 --> 09:02.359
[Distorted whispering] Philip.

09:04.392 --> 09:06.252
Bye.

09:13.311 --> 09:15.351
[Gasps]

09:15.614 --> 09:18.396
I heard somebody calling my name.

09:18.397 --> 09:22.152
And I explained to him that I had
been on the phone with his dad

09:22.153 --> 09:25.122
and that he had probably heard,

09:25.123 --> 09:30.394
through the way the sound traveled
in an empty house, me say his name.

09:30.395 --> 09:33.163
I'm sure that's what it was.

09:33.164 --> 09:37.535
And he said, no, we have to leave
this place and never come back.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.876
It's evil.

09:42.641 --> 09:44.642
[Clock ticking]

09:44.643 --> 09:46.743
Careful.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.245
My brother was a real prankster growing up,

09:49.246 --> 09:52.449
so when he said, oh, this is where
they displayed the coffins,

09:52.450 --> 09:55.319
I said, yeah.
I said, you're just pulling my leg.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.755
And he said, no, I can prove
this used to be a funeral home.

09:57.756 --> 09:59.624
[Wood creaking]

09:59.625 --> 10:01.458
Philip wasn't a fool.

10:01.459 --> 10:07.359
He had been messing around in the
rooms where he wasn't supposed to be.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.600
Give it a try.

10:09.601 --> 10:12.737
I didn't really want to, but, you know,
it's my older brother daring me to do it.

10:12.738 --> 10:16.741
And when your older brother
dares you, you have to do it.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.322
[Ominous music]

10:24.082 --> 10:27.852
The lights were going around and
around and around and around.

10:27.853 --> 10:30.120
Stop. Stop.

10:30.121 --> 10:32.256
Light, dark, light, dark,
light, dark, light, dark.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.177
Stop.

10:34.292 --> 10:36.212
Stop.

10:36.728 --> 10:38.648
Stop!

10:41.967 --> 10:43.801
He was really trying to creep me out.

10:43.802 --> 10:46.209
And the next morning, he said that...

10:46.210 --> 10:48.475
There's something cool
about these counters,

10:48.476 --> 10:50.904
that go all the way around the room.

10:50.905 --> 10:53.005
[Grunts]

10:54.279 --> 10:55.713
Put it right here.

10:55.714 --> 11:01.614
Once that hole was exposed, I just
remember a dark darkness behind it.

11:04.690 --> 11:06.457
Phil was in front.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.858
Then it was me.

11:07.859 --> 11:13.739
Then naturally me being the
youngest one, I was in the rear.

11:21.640 --> 11:26.200
And it was like a long, dark cave to me.

11:29.615 --> 11:30.982
You all right, Brad?

11:30.983 --> 11:32.903
Yeah.

11:40.458 --> 11:45.078
I noticed there was a stain on the ground.

11:45.463 --> 11:46.764
I was touching the stain.

11:46.765 --> 11:49.566
And it was...
It was a dark, thick substance.

11:49.567 --> 11:52.927
And it was really sticky.

11:55.273 --> 11:59.810
All of a sudden, Phil took his flashlight,
and he pointed it to the wall.

11:59.811 --> 12:01.278
[Gasps]

12:01.279 --> 12:02.913
What... What is that?

12:02.914 --> 12:07.714
It was a deep, dark red,
the color of blood.

12:16.268 --> 12:19.268
What... What is that?

12:19.284 --> 12:22.352
We're all getting nervous, and we're
all getting freaked out and spooked.

12:22.353 --> 12:24.689
Is that blood?

12:24.690 --> 12:26.850
Get out!

12:27.893 --> 12:30.928
I could just hear them screaming,
get out of here. Get out of here.

12:30.929 --> 12:33.831
When they came by me, there
wasn't a whole lot of room,

12:33.832 --> 12:36.433
so naturally, I got pushed out of the way.

12:36.434 --> 12:38.035
Go! Go! Go!

12:38.036 --> 12:40.196
[Panting]

12:41.372 --> 12:43.373
They were white as ghosts.

12:43.374 --> 12:47.011
And they said that there was
blood coming out of the walls.

12:47.012 --> 12:52.216
I said, if there was blood coming out of
the wall, I would see evidence of it.

12:52.217 --> 12:56.921
I thought that just paint running
down the wall that was dried.

12:56.922 --> 12:59.765
And I started laughing at them.
And I said...

12:59.766 --> 13:01.275
"Scared yourselves, didn't you?"

13:01.276 --> 13:07.176
"That's what you get for going in there.
You had no business being in there anyway."

13:08.767 --> 13:11.424
I felt that there was something
wrong with the house.

13:11.425 --> 13:13.403
And I was really unnerved.

13:13.404 --> 13:16.173
I didn't want to be in the house any more.

13:16.174 --> 13:19.977
I wanted to bring life back to the way
it was before my brother got sick.

13:19.978 --> 13:22.618
[Birds chirping]

13:25.216 --> 13:31.116
One day, I noticed the crucifix
inside the basement room disappeared.

13:34.359 --> 13:37.128
You could see the perfect outline.

13:37.129 --> 13:42.251
I believed that the kids were being
mischievous and taking them down,

13:42.252 --> 13:45.492
playing a prank on mom.

13:54.312 --> 13:56.892
[Clock ticking]

14:04.389 --> 14:07.892
I was worried about Philip,
who had been so ill.

14:07.893 --> 14:10.161
The treatment was putting
a lot of stress on him.

14:10.162 --> 14:15.199
And he was going through more
than I can probably imagine.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.780
[Clock ticking]

14:20.038 --> 14:22.206
[Distorted whispering] Philip.

14:22.207 --> 14:24.787

[Distorted whispering] Philip.

14:33.085 --> 14:35.665
[Clock ticking]

14:36.723 --> 14:39.483
The voices again?

14:41.259 --> 14:44.450
He said he was hearing them every night.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.965
But now he was seeing things as well.

14:47.966 --> 14:51.568
I was pretty sure it was a consequence
of the radiation to the head.

14:51.569 --> 14:53.070
It's okay, honey.

14:53.071 --> 14:58.411
I was surprised that he
wasn't seeing pink elephants.

14:59.010 --> 15:03.786
I was afraid that Philip was telling
the other kids these stories,

15:03.787 --> 15:08.527
and they're gonna believe
it no matter what.

15:08.854 --> 15:13.433
We'd been living in the house,
I guess, at least six months.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.325
Bedtime.

[Dishes clanking]

15:38.917 --> 15:41.497
[Clock ticking]

15:46.391 --> 15:47.925
- What is it?
- Shh.

15:47.926 --> 15:50.795
He was going, shh, shh.

15:50.796 --> 15:53.798
Don't say nothing, don't
say nothing, be quiet.

15:53.799 --> 15:55.399
[Whispering] Shh, be quiet.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.836
Look over in the corner, there's four
guys sitting over in the corner.

15:58.837 --> 16:03.397
[Whispering] Look at those guys over there.

16:05.143 --> 16:07.396
[Mechanical buzzing]

16:07.397 --> 16:11.182
My robot was going crazy.
And the four guys were standing around it.

16:11.183 --> 16:12.283
[Indistinct whispering]

16:12.284 --> 16:13.725
All I'd seen was the dark cloaks.

16:13.726 --> 16:16.733
I couldn't see if they
had any faces or not.

16:16.734 --> 16:21.774
All of a sudden, all four
of 'em simultaneously...

16:24.131 --> 16:30.031
My heart's in my throat, scared, you
know, just about to pee in my pants.

16:33.438 --> 16:36.412
[Indistinct whispering]

16:36.413 --> 16:37.965
- Mom!
- Mom!

16:37.966 --> 16:40.650
- There's four men in the basement.
- There's people in the basement.

16:40.651 --> 16:45.991
- And there's a...
- I was more angry than frightened.

16:46.351 --> 16:47.517
Come on.

16:47.518 --> 16:52.556
If somebody is in my house
with my babies, I get angry.

16:52.557 --> 16:55.059
I was going down to rip them a new one.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.640
[Wood creaking]

17:04.970 --> 17:07.705
Brad and Phil are right there next to me.

17:07.707 --> 17:10.294
[Whispering] I want you to wait here.

17:10.295 --> 17:11.775
Don't move.

17:11.776 --> 17:13.891
They're scared to death.

17:13.892 --> 17:16.712
[Suspenseful music]

17:58.056 --> 18:00.216
[Panting]

18:06.731 --> 18:08.771
[Sighs]

18:11.069 --> 18:14.204
The next way of coming into the basement

18:14.205 --> 18:18.642
would have been through the
back half of those rooms.

18:18.643 --> 18:21.103
[Door creaks]

18:22.013 --> 18:26.033
I went from room to room, looking.

18:39.797 --> 18:40.797
[Shrieks]

18:40.798 --> 18:42.204
Oh, God!

18:42.205 --> 18:44.365
[Panting]

18:45.971 --> 18:50.641
We looked in every possible
room and every possible place.

18:50.642 --> 18:52.078
And there was nobody there.

18:52.079 --> 18:55.188
It's okay. Go ahead and sit down.

18:55.189 --> 18:57.229
[Sighs]

19:03.982 --> 19:06.022
Police.

19:26.008 --> 19:30.208
No, well, I mean, I'm... I went to...

19:31.714 --> 19:33.444
Can I call you back?

19:33.445 --> 19:36.684
My mom noticed the crucifixes
were disappearing off the walls,

19:36.685 --> 19:37.803
but we were getting blamed for it.

19:37.804 --> 19:40.384
Okay, bye-bye.

19:40.633 --> 19:43.565
We kept telling our parents
that we weren't doing it.

19:43.566 --> 19:45.590
It was whatever was in the house.

19:45.591 --> 19:48.051
Philip! Brad!

19:48.288 --> 19:49.579
Mom, can we play?

19:49.580 --> 19:54.967
I said, all right, all of you,
family meeting, there's no ghost.

19:54.968 --> 19:57.870
We live in a funeral home or
what used to be a funeral home.

19:57.871 --> 20:01.072
There is no such thing as ghosts.

20:01.073 --> 20:04.677
They blamed Phil for a lot of
the stuff that we were seeing.

20:04.678 --> 20:06.941
I told him he needed to start...

20:06.942 --> 20:10.302
Acting his age and stop...

20:10.417 --> 20:12.017
Toying with the children.

20:12.018 --> 20:17.118
And I don't want to hear
any more ghost stories!

20:17.213 --> 20:18.746
[Door bangs]

20:18.747 --> 20:21.616
It was hard for me to be angry with Philip.
He had been so sick.

20:21.617 --> 20:25.097
He'd been through so much.

20:30.579 --> 20:32.480
It was a year after we moved in.

20:32.481 --> 20:37.752
I came home from school one day, and
he had moved his bed from my bedroom

20:37.753 --> 20:41.222
to the next room over
or the embalming room.

20:41.223 --> 20:44.061
And I said, you were so
afraid of that room.

20:44.062 --> 20:46.260
Why are you all of a sudden going in there?

20:46.261 --> 20:50.097
And he just shrugged his shoulders.

20:50.098 --> 20:52.434
Phil was constantly getting in trouble.

20:52.435 --> 20:53.902
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

20:53.903 --> 20:57.405
Puberty was kicking in.
He'd moved to a strange city.

20:57.406 --> 20:59.986
He had cancer.

21:02.010 --> 21:06.690
He was hearing voices.
He was seeing things.

21:08.984 --> 21:14.384
His doctors were telling him
it wasn't the medication.

21:14.857 --> 21:20.757
He became more withdrawn.
He didn't really talk to us as much.

21:21.196 --> 21:23.956
He rarely smiled.

21:26.502 --> 21:31.662
I did not know how to deal
with this other being.

21:32.004 --> 21:35.219
This person that he had become.

21:35.220 --> 21:39.480
I wanted my baby back to who he was.

21:41.484 --> 21:44.385
Come on, let's go.

21:44.386 --> 21:49.491
The second summer we lived there, two
cousins come stay with us, Kim and Tammy.

21:49.492 --> 21:51.593
Me and Philip had a really
great relationship.

21:51.594 --> 21:56.063
We just had this deep connection,
brotherly, sisterly, playful.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.232
How are you doing?

21:58.233 --> 22:03.393
Everybody greeted me at the
door except for Philip.

22:04.755 --> 22:07.475
I was kind of hurt.

22:07.476 --> 22:10.128
I wanted to hug him. I wanted him to...

22:10.129 --> 22:13.681
To be excited with me that
I was there, you know.

22:13.682 --> 22:16.382
He just wasn't.

22:20.856 --> 22:24.826
Phil had this book he always wrote in.

22:24.827 --> 22:27.144
So I'd come in there, and
I'd start bugging him or...

22:27.145 --> 22:29.230
What are you writing? What are you writing?

22:29.231 --> 22:34.271
He'd just sit there, and
he'd just look at me.

22:35.470 --> 22:39.430
It would send chills up my spine.

22:47.282 --> 22:51.002
I was helping Aunt Carm clean.

22:51.554 --> 22:55.694
Philip's room would get quite messy.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.936
As I went through Philip's notebook,

23:07.937 --> 23:11.599
I felt as if I were, you know...

23:11.600 --> 23:15.376
Invading his privacy,
taking something from him.

23:15.377 --> 23:18.857
But I was worried for him.

23:27.089 --> 23:28.890
I started to read the words.

23:28.891 --> 23:32.611
And they were very dark words.

23:38.991 --> 23:42.171
Everywhere about death...

23:42.522 --> 23:45.642
Murder, the word "kill."

23:48.711 --> 23:51.902
It was very terrifying to read
some of the dark thoughts

23:51.903 --> 23:55.683
that was going on in his head.

23:55.818 --> 23:59.866
And then I began to wonder if
they were his writings at all.

23:59.867 --> 24:03.347
Because Philip was dyslexic.

24:05.952 --> 24:10.333
I had spent years of trying to
teach him to write the alphabet

24:10.334 --> 24:14.654
let alone these complete, complex words.

24:17.673 --> 24:21.509
When I ask him, how did you write them?

24:21.510 --> 24:25.661
He said "the man helped him write them."

24:25.662 --> 24:28.662
[Distorted whispering]

24:32.250 --> 24:34.088
[Dishes clanking] That's my spot.

24:34.089 --> 24:37.125
One night, we were at dinner.

24:37.126 --> 24:43.026
Philip reached around me at the
dinner table, and his sleeve went up.

24:45.457 --> 24:47.031
What's that?

24:47.032 --> 24:51.592
And I noticed these scratches in his arms.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.230
What is this?

24:57.686 --> 25:01.226
[Distorted whispering] Philip.

25:01.294 --> 25:04.174
[Whispering] Philip.

25:05.528 --> 25:07.610
And I'd ask him, Philip,
why are you doing that?

25:07.611 --> 25:10.217
Why are you making yourself bleed?
What are you doing?

25:10.218 --> 25:13.653
And he would say, I don't know what I'm
doing, I don't know why I'm doing it.

25:13.654 --> 25:17.734
Something is telling me to do this.

25:20.803 --> 25:23.437
This was not Philip's nature at all.

25:23.438 --> 25:27.041
It wasn't anything that I was used to.

25:27.042 --> 25:30.402
But now he was different.

25:40.727 --> 25:42.767
[Gasps]

25:44.329 --> 25:50.229
You could always seem him kind of just
leaning around, looking out at you.

25:52.537 --> 25:56.797
It would scare me. It would spook me.

25:59.554 --> 26:04.491
As time progressed and Philip's
personality changed more and more...

26:04.492 --> 26:07.852
He became more aggressive.

26:10.932 --> 26:13.362
He'd come and say something to me,
and I'd say something back to him.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.822
And the next thing I know,
we were throwing punches.

26:16.823 --> 26:18.208
Why are you so angry?

26:18.209 --> 26:20.006
[ Smack ]

26:20.007 --> 26:24.087
And then Tammy went to defend Brad.

26:24.162 --> 26:25.649
Get off of him, Philip!

26:25.650 --> 26:27.910
Come on, what is wrong with you?

26:27.911 --> 26:31.520
And he went and ran into my room.

26:31.521 --> 26:33.171
And he just destroyed my room.

26:33.172 --> 26:35.512
Philip, no!

26:35.690 --> 26:37.858
Stop, let go of me!

26:37.859 --> 26:39.392
Stop!

26:39.393 --> 26:41.160
Stop!

26:41.161 --> 26:43.741
Let go of me!

26:44.031 --> 26:45.250
Stop it.

26:45.251 --> 26:47.051
No.

26:47.101 --> 26:48.468
[Screams]

26:48.469 --> 26:51.272
Out of nowhere, he became
very, very strong...

26:51.273 --> 26:52.639
Stop!

26:52.640 --> 26:53.840
Stop it!

26:53.841 --> 26:57.561
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

27:00.800 --> 27:03.282
Threw me across the room
like I was nothing.

27:03.283 --> 27:07.063
It put the fear of God in me.

27:09.524 --> 27:13.426
This was a person who had cancer.
He was a sick boy.

27:13.427 --> 27:17.818
There was no way he was able to
throw me across the room like that.

27:17.819 --> 27:20.513
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

27:20.514 --> 27:22.914
[Door slams]

27:22.951 --> 27:27.106
After this big fight with Philip,
things really started to change for me.

27:27.107 --> 27:29.687
[Clock ticking]

27:32.079 --> 27:34.839
[Blanket rustling]

27:36.851 --> 27:42.751
It was like hands were grabbing the
bed covers and pulling them down.

27:44.959 --> 27:49.519
I felt like something was coming after me.

27:50.401 --> 27:52.293
- Aunt Carmen?
- Yeah.

27:52.294 --> 27:54.367
I... I don't know what it is, but...

27:54.368 --> 27:57.296
My bed covers are being
pulled off of my bed.

27:57.297 --> 28:00.191
And my shirt is, like, being lifted up.

28:00.192 --> 28:03.821
She would feel it pulling at her bra strap.

28:03.822 --> 28:06.882
I felt very violated.

28:06.929 --> 28:11.573
She was very frightened because she didn't
see what was pulling at her sheets,

28:11.574 --> 28:14.176
and she didn't see what was
pulling at her blanket.

28:14.177 --> 28:20.077
But at the end of the day, there is
no way I believed that is was ghosts.

28:22.193 --> 28:28.093
The only conclusion I could come up
with was that it was my son, my baby.

28:28.465 --> 28:31.410
That he was doing this.

28:31.411 --> 28:33.598
Okay, guys, time to go.

28:33.599 --> 28:36.306
I didn't know what to
feel or what to think.

28:36.307 --> 28:40.059
I was more like a robot running on,

28:40.060 --> 28:43.540
battery power than anything.

28:44.615 --> 28:48.047
Your emotions are very torn.

28:48.048 --> 28:51.872
- What's wrong, mom?
- Nothing, nothing.

28:51.873 --> 28:55.892
This is your prized possession.
This is your firstborn child.

28:55.893 --> 28:57.780
And you adore him.

28:57.781 --> 29:01.086
And you've suffered through
his skinned knees and his...

29:01.087 --> 29:04.627
His cancer and his Dyslexia.

29:06.024 --> 29:09.560
But you have to protect your
nieces and your daughters

29:09.561 --> 29:13.701
and the other children in the house.

29:14.332 --> 29:20.232
Alan was in New York, so I'm left
with deciding on how to handle it.

29:23.675 --> 29:25.443
I called his doctor.

29:25.444 --> 29:27.525
It's about Philip.

29:27.526 --> 29:31.786
And I said, this is what's going on.

29:32.084 --> 29:37.124
It has to be handled before
it gets any further.

29:37.270 --> 29:41.830
And he said I was describing Schizophrenia.

29:44.229 --> 29:48.129
It's time to have him committed.

29:56.308 --> 29:58.942
I was a vacuum.

29:58.943 --> 30:01.300
My emotions were just...

30:01.301 --> 30:03.641
Completely...

30:03.726 --> 30:05.646
Void.

30:14.426 --> 30:20.326
Come 6:00, I'm trying to act as if
nothing's going on, everything's normal.

30:21.108 --> 30:23.309
I make his favorite dinner.

30:23.310 --> 30:25.711
After dessert, we'll have
a race outside, guys.

30:25.712 --> 30:27.480
We're gonna have a race, okay?

30:27.481 --> 30:29.615
All of you guys... And I will be the judge.

30:29.616 --> 30:34.176
And whoever runs...
[Door clicks and creaks]

30:37.305 --> 30:42.362
They didn't even knock.
They just entered into the house.

30:42.363 --> 30:46.095
It was just, like, all
the happiness was gone.

30:46.096 --> 30:48.101
Everybody was sitting there quiet.

30:48.102 --> 30:50.632
- Come on, son, come with us.
- Kids, can you come with me?

30:50.633 --> 30:53.740
Mom, please, mom, don't do this. Mom?

30:53.741 --> 30:57.497
And your son's looking at you,
saying, mom, don't do this.

30:57.498 --> 30:59.837
Mom, please, don't do this.

30:59.838 --> 31:01.525
- Why are they here?
- Son.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.688
What did I do?

31:02.689 --> 31:05.391
He was screaming at this point,
you know, why, what's going on?

31:05.392 --> 31:07.234
Where... Where are we going?

31:07.235 --> 31:09.561
Why are they here?

31:09.562 --> 31:12.688
I couldn't tell him.
I just would cry and tell him, I'm sorry.

31:12.689 --> 31:14.163
I'm so sorry, Philip.

31:14.164 --> 31:15.653
[Yelling indistinctly]

31:15.654 --> 31:18.461
Why are they here?

31:18.462 --> 31:21.005
I wanted to believe him.
I wanted to believe him.

31:21.006 --> 31:24.667
But every time that they had told me
that there was something going on,

31:24.668 --> 31:29.639
I went in there, and I looked,
and I never found anything.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.760
So I couldn't prove...

31:33.026 --> 31:36.686
That there was anything there.

31:36.780 --> 31:39.900
[Yelling and screaming]

31:40.872 --> 31:43.392
[Shrieks] Mom!

31:47.891 --> 31:50.236
So I had to cover all my bases.

31:50.237 --> 31:53.774
And I had to make sure the
other children were safe.

31:53.775 --> 31:55.632
Mom!

31:55.633 --> 31:57.534
I'm right behind you, baby.

31:57.535 --> 31:59.175
Mom!

31:59.176 --> 32:02.116
I want to go home!

32:02.773 --> 32:04.633
Mom!

32:05.709 --> 32:08.678
And then they strapped
him in a straitjacket.

32:08.679 --> 32:10.479
No!

32:10.881 --> 32:12.615
[Crying and screaming]

32:12.616 --> 32:14.284
And they wouldn't let me go in.

32:14.285 --> 32:17.345
[Speaking indistinctly]

32:21.592 --> 32:24.594
He said, "mama, don't leave me.
Mama, don't leave me."

32:24.595 --> 32:26.875
[Shrieking]

32:27.331 --> 32:30.667
"Now that I'm gone, they're
gonna come after you."

32:30.668 --> 32:31.908
[Screams]

32:31.909 --> 32:37.809
He's yelling, "now that I'm gone,
they're gonna come after you."

32:49.980 --> 32:52.560
I'm so sorry.

32:52.655 --> 32:54.523
What did I do?

32:54.524 --> 32:57.292
I cried the entire way, and I was angry.

32:57.293 --> 32:59.393
[Crying]

33:02.003 --> 33:07.463
Everything he said to me as
I left preyed on my mind.

33:07.832 --> 33:11.492
They're gonna come after you.

33:12.734 --> 33:16.059
I felt very conflicted because for months,

33:16.060 --> 33:20.597
I had been finding rational
explanations for everything.

33:20.598 --> 33:26.498
But at this point, I was in such a rage
that I was ready to believe anything...

33:27.120 --> 33:33.020
Other than that my son was gonna be a
schizophrenic the rest of his life.

33:36.213 --> 33:40.413
I went directly down the back stairs.

33:41.686 --> 33:45.220
And I said, all right, you son of a bitch,
you want to play, you come play with me.

33:45.221 --> 33:47.801
[Clock ticking]

33:52.530 --> 33:57.690
It was very...
Very solemn, very still, very eerie...

34:02.528 --> 34:05.468
Just a quiet eerie.

34:06.192 --> 34:09.371
I sat there for hours.

34:12.290 --> 34:15.350
Nothing ever appeared.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.545
[Crickets chirping]

34:26.362 --> 34:28.943
[Clock ticking]

34:30.301 --> 34:34.380
It wasn't long after, in my room...

34:44.882 --> 34:47.042
[Shrieks]

34:47.851 --> 34:49.891
[Gasps]

34:49.954 --> 34:52.589
Philip wasn't around.
This wasn't something that he did.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.422
You know, he's not home.
He's in the hospital.

34:54.424 --> 34:56.092
[Glass banging]

34:56.092 --> 34:58.024
- Aunt Carm.
- Who is it?

34:58.025 --> 35:01.297
- It's happening again.
- Philip's not in the house.

35:01.298 --> 35:05.335
And I have no explanation
for what's going on.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.376
[Sighs]

35:08.005 --> 35:10.765
On the way out...

35:10.839 --> 35:16.599
I happened to notice that the
last crucifix had disappeared.

35:17.515 --> 35:22.855
So all of the crucifixes in
the house were now gone.

35:24.321 --> 35:29.626
At this point, nothing that
I knew to be true was true.

35:29.627 --> 35:33.047
Nothing that I understood...

35:33.412 --> 35:35.899
To be was what it was.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.196
I was in the Twilight Zone.

35:38.197 --> 35:40.690
Though a host should encamp me
against me, my heart shall not fear.

35:40.691 --> 35:43.191
Got her tucked into bed.

35:43.192 --> 35:45.727
And I began to read from the Bible.

35:45.728 --> 35:48.945
One thing have I desired of the
Lord that I will seek after.

35:48.946 --> 35:52.549
That I may dwell in the
house of the Lord all...

35:52.550 --> 35:55.118
And she said, Aunt Carmen, it's coming.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.820
Can you feel it? It's coming.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.455
Yea, I will sing praise unto the Lord...

35:59.456 --> 36:03.426
I felt a hand just rise
up under my clothes.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.161
Get it off!

36:05.162 --> 36:07.442
[Shrieking]

36:07.798 --> 36:11.601
I can see the bones and the
wrist and the knuckles.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.069
[Shrieking]

36:13.070 --> 36:15.438
[Speaking indistinctly]

36:15.439 --> 36:17.874
It was violating. It was just horrifying.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.155
[Screaming]

36:21.145 --> 36:23.279
I scooped her up.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.983
And I ran into the dining room.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.984
[Gasping and panting]

36:30.421 --> 36:31.854
Hallowed be thy name.

36:31.855 --> 36:33.729
Thy kingdom come.

36:33.730 --> 36:36.927
Thy will be done on heaven.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.088
[Panting]

36:39.864 --> 36:42.444
[Clock ticking]

36:49.280 --> 36:51.264
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

36:51.265 --> 36:54.811
No. I can feel it coming.
Aunt Carm, I can feel it coming.

36:54.812 --> 36:58.552
And she says, Aunt Carmen, can you feel it?
It's coming, and I can feel it.

36:58.553 --> 37:00.650
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

37:00.651 --> 37:04.854
- Growling and the motion of the room...
- It's coming back!

37:04.855 --> 37:08.458
- And the coldness, the smell...
- It's coming for me.

37:08.459 --> 37:10.526
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.

37:10.527 --> 37:12.228
Thy will be done!

37:12.229 --> 37:16.600
I could feel it, but I couldn't
see it or fight it back.

37:16.601 --> 37:20.169
My rosary begins to
levitate up off my neck.

37:20.170 --> 37:23.890
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

37:29.580 --> 37:33.683
I realized that I was wrong in
committing Philip at this point.

37:33.684 --> 37:36.624
[Electricity buzzing]

37:37.731 --> 37:40.371
[Beads clacking]

37:46.296 --> 37:48.898
So I pick up the phone,
and I call the church.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.941
Fortunately, they believed me.

37:51.942 --> 37:56.172
And they just told me that there
would be an exorcist there tomorrow.

37:56.173 --> 37:58.333
[Panting]

37:58.421 --> 38:02.141
I was so joyous that finally...

38:02.209 --> 38:05.915
Somebody's gonna come in to heal my family.

38:05.916 --> 38:08.496
[Water running]

38:17.593 --> 38:19.029
[Screaming]

38:19.030 --> 38:22.498
The shower curtain very
quickly wrapped around me.

38:22.499 --> 38:24.500
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

38:24.501 --> 38:26.416
And I couldn't push away.

38:26.417 --> 38:28.697
[Screaming]

38:30.975 --> 38:33.780
It was completely tightened
around my face...

38:33.781 --> 38:35.912
[Yelling]

38:35.913 --> 38:38.247
As if somebody was trying to smother me.

38:38.248 --> 38:40.283
[Distorted indistinct whispering]

38:40.284 --> 38:42.444
[Gasping]

38:43.020 --> 38:45.321
And it's getting tighter.

38:45.322 --> 38:48.142
[Curtain squeaking]

38:51.528 --> 38:53.296
Help! Help!

38:53.297 --> 38:55.364
I thought, this thing is trying to kill me.

38:55.365 --> 38:56.966
[Shrieking]

38:56.967 --> 38:59.787
It wants me dead.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.340
Help! Help!

39:08.341 --> 39:09.609
Tammy!

39:09.610 --> 39:11.711
I hear my Aunt Carm calling for me.

39:11.712 --> 39:14.413
[Yelling indistinctly]

39:14.414 --> 39:17.216
And the more I screamed,
the tighter it got.

39:17.217 --> 39:20.217
[Yelling indistinctly]

39:20.386 --> 39:22.454
If I didn't get her out
soon, she would suffocate.

39:22.455 --> 39:23.990
[Screaming]

39:23.991 --> 39:26.507
I got you! It's okay!
I pulled, and I ripped.

39:26.508 --> 39:28.788
[Screaming]

39:29.029 --> 39:31.189
[Gasping]

39:39.572 --> 39:42.212
[Birds chirping]

39:44.878 --> 39:49.882
That house changed every aspect
of my life, my children's lives.

39:49.883 --> 39:54.743
And it changed us to the
core of who we are.

39:57.691 --> 40:03.211
The guilt of what I've done
to my son is overwhelming.

40:06.133 --> 40:09.669
I knew that I had to get
Philip out of the hospital.

40:09.670 --> 40:13.870
And get that stigma removed from him.

40:19.393 --> 40:21.733
You coming?

40:32.092 --> 40:35.360
The first time I saw him,
I just grabbed a hold.

40:35.361 --> 40:37.541
And I held him, and I rocked him.

40:37.542 --> 40:43.182
And I rubbed his head.
And I said, I am so sorry, baby.

40:50.290 --> 40:51.490
Are you there?

40:51.491 --> 40:53.092
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

40:53.093 --> 40:55.793
[Static crackles]

40:56.594 --> 40:59.196
Well, I told my mom from day one...

40:59.197 --> 41:02.299
That the house was evil.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.337
My parents weren't believing me.

41:04.338 --> 41:09.498
And I guess, yeah, I became
more fascinated with...

41:09.841 --> 41:11.758
Rather than frightened.

41:11.759 --> 41:15.061
Of the things that were in the basement.

41:15.062 --> 41:18.645
My mom was trying to be
strong on one hand...

41:18.646 --> 41:22.287
And do what she thought...
felt was right, you know.

41:22.288 --> 41:26.848
But I definitely felt a sense of betrayal.

41:27.342 --> 41:31.812
It took a lot of time for
Philip to re-trust...

41:31.813 --> 41:36.256
Just through everyday love and trust and...

41:36.257 --> 41:38.657
Conversation.

41:39.720 --> 41:42.127
It's hard to describe the way, you know,

41:42.128 --> 41:44.298
evil can actually...

41:44.299 --> 41:48.852
Find its way into little nooks
and crannies in your life and...

41:48.853 --> 41:52.431
You know, begin to
manipulate you like that.

41:52.432 --> 41:55.601
He came to me one day in the kitchen

41:55.602 --> 41:57.703
about a week before he passed.

41:57.704 --> 41:59.037
And he said...

41:59.038 --> 42:01.858
"Mom, am I evil?"

42:04.144 --> 42:06.328
I was stunned. I... I was...

42:06.329 --> 42:08.314
"No, baby, you're not evil."

42:08.315 --> 42:11.718
"You're a sweet, sweet boy."

42:11.719 --> 42:14.899
"And I'm proud of you."
