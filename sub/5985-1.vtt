01:29.044 --> 01:30.379
Turn him over.

01:32.298 --> 01:33.549
Oh, no!  

02:23.432 --> 02:26.185
<i>"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...</i>

02:26.852 --> 02:29.021
<i>"thou, nor thy sons with thee...</i>

02:29.438 --> 02:31.273
"lest ye shall die.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.568
"Look not thou upon the wine
when it is red...

02:34.860 --> 02:39.281
"and when it bringeth his color
in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

02:39.448 --> 02:42.201
"At the last it biteth like a serpent...

02:42.368 --> 02:44.453
"and stingeth like an adder."

02:44.703 --> 02:45.955
Now, folks...

02:53.796 --> 02:55.798
that's from the Good Book...

02:55.881 --> 02:57.466
but in this here town...

02:57.633 --> 02:59.802
it's five cents a glass.

03:00.636 --> 03:02.429
Five cents a glass.

03:03.055 --> 03:06.642
Does anyone really think
that that is the price of a drink?

03:08.143 --> 03:10.896
The price of a drink? Let him decide...

03:11.564 --> 03:13.983
who has lost his courage and his pride...

03:14.066 --> 03:17.653
who lies a groveling
heap of clay not far removed...

04:15.461 --> 04:17.129
All's quiet, sir.

04:17.963 --> 04:19.298
Let's fall in.

04:31.769 --> 04:32.937
Follow me.

04:49.495 --> 04:51.247
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

04:52.164 --> 04:54.500
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.

04:54.667 --> 04:55.793
Thank you.

04:56.001 --> 04:57.127
May I?

04:57.503 --> 04:58.629
Thank you.

05:07.513 --> 05:09.807
Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

05:09.932 --> 05:11.058
Take a look.

05:20.693 --> 05:23.153
I don't care what you meant to do...

05:23.320 --> 05:25.531
it's what you did I don't like.

05:30.870 --> 05:34.081
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

05:34.165 --> 05:36.041
and this railroad in the bargain.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.128
Now, I want you to apologize to this...

05:39.670 --> 05:41.338
Yes, sir, can I help you?

05:50.514 --> 05:52.391
If they move, kill them.

05:57.396 --> 05:58.772
Is he with them?

05:59.690 --> 06:00.858
He's there.

06:01.734 --> 06:03.444
Hold your fire! Get down!

06:03.527 --> 06:05.237
Wait till they come out.

06:06.906 --> 06:08.490
I can nail him.

06:11.702 --> 06:13.204
I said, wait!

06:14.079 --> 06:15.789
What if they slip out the back way?

06:15.873 --> 06:18.959
It's covered.
You two-bit redneck peckerwood.

06:22.755 --> 06:23.881
Abe?

06:37.228 --> 06:38.812
I solemnly promise...

06:40.439 --> 06:41.982
God helping me...

06:42.066 --> 06:44.777
"I solemnly promise, God helping me."

06:45.903 --> 06:49.281
...to abstain from all distilled,
fermented malt liquors...

06:49.615 --> 06:52.243
including wine, beer and cider.

06:52.576 --> 06:55.829
"To abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer."

07:24.483 --> 07:26.777
People marching and singing,
coming down the street.

07:26.861 --> 07:28.195
They're gonna pass by the horses.

07:28.445 --> 07:29.822
We'll join them.

07:30.155 --> 07:32.032
The Temperance Union?

07:37.955 --> 07:39.373
They should have been told.

07:39.456 --> 07:40.583
Told what?

07:40.666 --> 07:42.668
How long do you think
anybody in this manure pile...

07:42.751 --> 07:44.295
could keep his mouth shut?

07:53.137 --> 07:55.389
<i>Yes, we'll gather at the river</i>

07:57.141 --> 07:59.518
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

08:01.645 --> 08:04.315
<i>Gather with the saints at the river</i>

08:05.524 --> 08:06.609
Rifles.

08:09.987 --> 08:11.113
One?

08:12.031 --> 08:13.282
No, three!

08:19.205 --> 08:21.248
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

08:23.667 --> 08:24.752
Get down.

08:25.002 --> 08:26.378
Son of a bitch!

08:27.338 --> 08:29.965
- Lyle, Dutch.
- What are they, bounty hunters?

08:30.049 --> 08:31.717
Hell, I wouldn't know.

08:31.884 --> 08:33.344
Buck, with Abe.

08:34.511 --> 08:36.013
- I kill them now?
- No.

08:36.096 --> 08:38.933
Hold them here as long as you can
until after the shooting starts.

08:39.015 --> 08:42.394
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

08:58.035 --> 09:00.204
When I kick him out, blast them.

09:00.371 --> 09:01.747
We'll make a run for it.

09:01.914 --> 09:03.499
C.L., give me that shotgun.

09:06.043 --> 09:08.045
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

09:09.588 --> 09:11.882
<i>Gather with the saints at the river</i>

09:13.384 --> 09:15.886
<i>That flows by the throne of God</i>

10:15.988 --> 10:17.114
Set?

10:46.310 --> 10:47.394
Let's go!

11:06.580 --> 11:07.957
Good luck, boys!

11:31.021 --> 11:33.190
They're blowing this town all to hell!

11:50.291 --> 11:51.542
You're trash!

12:17.985 --> 12:19.904
Now, you just hush now.

12:28.662 --> 12:31.373
They was playing <i>Gather at the River.</i>

12:32.333 --> 12:33.751
You know that one?

12:35.336 --> 12:36.378
Sing it!

12:37.171 --> 12:39.465
<i>Shall we gather at the river</i>

12:40.841 --> 12:43.427
<i>Where bright angel feet have trod</i>

13:08.452 --> 13:09.537
Hurry!

13:09.620 --> 13:12.414
<i>River that flows by the throne of God</i>

14:14.518 --> 14:16.437
Come on, you lazy bastard!

14:16.604 --> 14:17.771
I'm coming, damn it!

14:22.943 --> 14:25.362
They've cleared out, for Christ's sake!

14:26.113 --> 14:27.698
Let's go, T. C!

14:37.333 --> 14:39.043
Put some more on!

14:52.640 --> 14:53.974
Let's go!

15:28.008 --> 15:29.093
Take him!

15:30.594 --> 15:31.720
He's mine!

15:36.350 --> 15:38.102
- He's mine!
- Mr. Harrigan.

15:38.644 --> 15:39.854
He's mine!

15:40.187 --> 15:43.190
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

15:43.357 --> 15:46.360
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my.06!

15:46.443 --> 15:47.862
You know I shot him.

15:47.945 --> 15:50.865
You'd claim the whole thing,
wouldn't you?

15:52.116 --> 15:54.493
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Did he have any money?

15:56.745 --> 15:59.081
Damn, I can't get his belt off!

16:02.793 --> 16:04.545
You stupid, damn fools!

16:05.045 --> 16:08.007
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

16:08.090 --> 16:10.968
I didn't shoot that employee!
My first shot killed this man right here!

16:11.051 --> 16:12.219
Liar!

16:12.553 --> 16:17.683
He shot that employee while I was
dropping this bandit and them others, too.

16:17.850 --> 16:19.894
I must've killed all three of them.

16:19.977 --> 16:22.479
Killed all three of them?
What were we doing up on that roof?

16:23.772 --> 16:25.816
Liar! Black liar!

16:25.900 --> 16:27.902
You shouldn't talk like that to me.

16:30.070 --> 16:31.197
I'm sorry.

16:32.907 --> 16:35.618
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

16:39.663 --> 16:41.832
I think this will do pretty good.

16:41.916 --> 16:42.958
Harrigan!

16:43.584 --> 16:47.838
Next time, you better plan the massacre
more carefully, or I'll start with you.

16:47.922 --> 16:50.758
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

17:00.851 --> 17:02.019
Stop!

17:06.272 --> 17:08.358
Feathers flew like a turkey!

17:08.943 --> 17:10.986
They shouldn't have run.

17:12.820 --> 17:13.906
Say!

17:19.869 --> 17:24.290
How'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

17:40.975 --> 17:43.143
This is better than a hog-killing!

17:45.062 --> 17:46.647
Get them out of here!

17:51.318 --> 17:55.406
We're holding you and your whole damn
railroad responsible for this carnage!

17:55.489 --> 17:57.616
- Mr. Benson...
- Innocent people are dead!

17:57.700 --> 18:01.412
Women dying and mangled because
you used our town as a battlefield!

18:01.495 --> 18:04.915
You're going to pay! The railroad
is going to pay for our loss of blood!

18:05.082 --> 18:07.418
We were trying to catch
a band of outlaws!

18:07.585 --> 18:09.253
You lured that gang in here!

18:09.420 --> 18:13.174
The railroad has been blabbing their
mouth about a big payload for weeks!

18:13.340 --> 18:15.050
We represent the law!

18:43.954 --> 18:45.623
Pike, is that you?

18:45.789 --> 18:47.291
I can ride, Pike.

18:47.541 --> 18:48.709
I can ride.

18:49.627 --> 18:51.879
I can't see, but I can ride.

18:53.714 --> 18:54.757
God!

18:55.132 --> 18:56.217
No!

18:57.051 --> 18:58.552
I can't ride.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.304
Finish it.

19:31.418 --> 19:34.421
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him...

19:35.214 --> 19:36.507
a decent burial?

19:36.590 --> 19:37.842
He was a good man.

19:37.925 --> 19:39.510
I think we ought to bury him.

19:39.677 --> 19:41.011
He's dead!

19:41.428 --> 19:43.764
He's got a lot of good men back there
to keep him company!

19:43.848 --> 19:45.266
Too damn many!

19:47.518 --> 19:49.436
I think the boys are right.

19:49.937 --> 19:53.566
I'd like to say a few words for the dear,
dead departed.

19:54.859 --> 19:57.278
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

19:58.028 --> 19:59.864
Followed by a church supper...

19:59.947 --> 20:01.282
with a choir!

20:01.782 --> 20:04.201
You crazy bastards, both of you!

20:16.213 --> 20:19.133
Bishop, Engstrom, the Gorch brothers!

20:19.425 --> 20:24.471
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

20:24.972 --> 20:27.683
When the hard-money value
of the men you killed...

20:27.766 --> 20:31.187
less my commission, adds up to $500!

20:31.979 --> 20:35.608
Any one of those pelts would've
not only cleared you with the company...

20:35.691 --> 20:37.985
but given you a bundle of money
to raise hell with!

20:38.068 --> 20:40.154
We'll do better next time!

20:41.488 --> 20:45.075
We'll do anything you say, but we sure
would appreciate liquor money for tonight.

20:45.159 --> 20:48.829
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

20:49.330 --> 20:51.999
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

20:52.416 --> 20:54.585
If one of you tries to quit on me...

20:54.668 --> 20:57.087
I'll pay a bonus of $1,000...

20:57.671 --> 20:59.632
to the man that kills him!

21:14.021 --> 21:15.940
Let's pack it up then!

21:21.111 --> 21:23.030
- Mr. Harrigan.
- Why should I let you go with them?

21:23.113 --> 21:24.448
We've been over that.

21:24.532 --> 21:25.616
You might run off with them.

21:25.699 --> 21:27.827
Might even join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

21:27.910 --> 21:30.538
What I like and what I need
are two different things.

21:30.621 --> 21:31.914
Listen, Mr. Harrigan.

21:32.998 --> 21:36.043
I don't want to go back to prison,
never again.

21:36.126 --> 21:38.212
But it's got to be my way!
I need some good men!

21:38.295 --> 21:39.880
You saw what happened
out there this morning!

21:39.964 --> 21:43.175
You'll use what you have and you'll see
to it that it doesn't happen again...

21:43.259 --> 21:45.678
or I'll see you spend the rest of your life
behind bars.

21:45.761 --> 21:47.429
Try to run,
I'll be after you and so will they.

21:47.513 --> 21:48.806
I gave you my word.

21:48.889 --> 21:50.724
Well, we'll see what it's worth!

21:51.183 --> 21:52.643
Six minutes.

21:53.811 --> 21:56.814
Tell me, Mr. Harrigan, how does it feel...

21:57.022 --> 21:58.691
getting paid for it?

21:59.692 --> 22:04.572
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

22:04.822 --> 22:07.533
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

22:07.700 --> 22:08.909
Good.

22:08.993 --> 22:11.078
You dirty son of a bitch!

22:11.412 --> 22:15.040
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

22:15.416 --> 22:18.002
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

22:19.545 --> 22:22.840
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

22:23.048 --> 22:26.302
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

22:49.575 --> 22:51.952
I don't see nothing so <i>lindo</i> about it.

22:52.119 --> 22:54.747
Just looks like more of Texas
as far as I'm concerned.

22:54.955 --> 22:56.457
You have no eyes.

23:27.321 --> 23:30.199
Got a half-hour of light. Let's go.

23:44.839 --> 23:46.340
Hello, little fella.

24:29.884 --> 24:32.136
- Them other fellas...
- They're not coming!

24:32.219 --> 24:33.637
- None of them?
- No.

24:33.721 --> 24:37.725
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.

25:13.260 --> 25:15.054
Now, about the sharing up.

25:15.846 --> 25:17.848
The sharing up will be the same as always.

25:18.766 --> 25:22.686
Well, me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

25:23.020 --> 25:27.149
He's just starting out, and this is mine
and Tector's opening for a new territory.

25:27.274 --> 25:28.442
That's right.

25:28.526 --> 25:31.445
And I figure a share to that old goat
for watching them horses...

25:31.529 --> 25:33.447
is damn sure a share too much.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.245
So, we decided...

25:40.162 --> 25:41.580
it ain't fair.

25:42.706 --> 25:47.503
If you two boys don't like equal shares,
why in the hell don't you just take all of it?

25:51.507 --> 25:54.635
Well, why don't you answer me,
you damned, yellow-livered trash?

25:54.718 --> 25:56.303
Now, Pike, you know damn well...

25:56.387 --> 26:00.891
I don't know a damned thing except that
I either lead this bunch or end it right now.

26:07.731 --> 26:08.774
All right.

26:10.025 --> 26:12.570
We divide it up just like you say.

26:14.029 --> 26:16.198
Chick, chick, chick, chick.

26:31.755 --> 26:33.090
Silver rings.

26:33.340 --> 26:36.510
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

26:38.220 --> 26:39.555
Bastards!

26:41.098 --> 26:42.224
Washers!

26:45.436 --> 26:46.478
Washers!

26:48.606 --> 26:53.819
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

26:54.737 --> 26:56.030
They set it up!

26:56.113 --> 26:58.616
They? Who in the hell is "they"?

27:04.788 --> 27:05.956
"They?"

27:08.250 --> 27:10.753
Why, "they" is just plain and fancy "they."

27:10.878 --> 27:12.463
That's who "they" is.

27:13.297 --> 27:16.467
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

27:16.800 --> 27:19.470
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

27:21.305 --> 27:23.182
Oh, my, what a bunch!

27:24.266 --> 27:25.559
Big tough one!

27:27.770 --> 27:31.232
Here you are with a handful of holes,
a thumb up your ass...

27:31.398 --> 27:34.568
and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

27:35.611 --> 27:36.820
"They!"

27:36.987 --> 27:38.989
Who the hell is "they"?

27:44.787 --> 27:46.288
Railroad men.

27:47.289 --> 27:48.791
Bounty hunters.

27:50.125 --> 27:51.502
Deke Thornton.

27:52.336 --> 27:53.796
Deke Thornton?

27:54.922 --> 27:56.423
He was one of them?

27:59.176 --> 28:01.178
How the hell come you didn't know that?

28:01.428 --> 28:02.888
Hey, <i>gringo.</i>

28:07.351 --> 28:09.061
You can have my silver.

28:10.312 --> 28:13.232
Come on, <i>gringo,</i> don't kill me.

28:17.903 --> 28:19.822
You can have the silver.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.033
But don't kill me.

28:23.409 --> 28:24.660
Please?

28:29.665 --> 28:30.958
Go on...

28:31.959 --> 28:33.210
go for it.

28:33.961 --> 28:35.379
Fall apart.

28:38.257 --> 28:40.009
Walk softly, boys.

29:09.705 --> 29:11.290
What's our next move?

29:11.707 --> 29:14.293
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

29:15.127 --> 29:16.587
Three days, maybe.

29:17.004 --> 29:19.507
We'll get the news and drift to the border.

29:20.799 --> 29:22.551
Maybe a payroll, maybe a bank.

29:22.635 --> 29:24.720
Maybe that damn railroad!

29:24.887 --> 29:28.807
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure as hell ain't getting no easier.

29:28.974 --> 29:31.519
And you boys ain't getting
any younger, either.

29:32.478 --> 29:35.022
We gotta start thinking beyond our guns.

29:35.731 --> 29:37.650
Those days are closing fast.

29:45.699 --> 29:49.829
All your fancy planning and talking
damn near got us shot to pieces...

29:49.912 --> 29:52.540
over a few lousy bags of washers.

29:52.915 --> 29:56.836
Well, this was going to be me and Tector's
last job before we quit and headed south!

29:56.919 --> 29:59.922
We spent all our time and money
getting ready for this!

30:00.005 --> 30:02.967
You spent all your time and money
running whores in Hondo...

30:03.050 --> 30:04.885
while I spent my stake setting it up!

30:13.936 --> 30:18.190
Hell, I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

30:19.191 --> 30:21.110
While you was doing all that planning...

30:21.193 --> 30:24.446
me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

30:24.530 --> 30:26.866
two, mind you, Hondo whores!

30:31.370 --> 30:33.873
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

30:34.456 --> 30:35.708
He was.

30:41.297 --> 30:43.382
You were matching whores...

30:44.466 --> 30:45.885
in tandem!

30:47.595 --> 30:48.804
What's that?

30:49.305 --> 30:50.890
That's one behind the other.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.062
That's right! That's what we was doing!

31:17.416 --> 31:18.667
Mr. Thornton?

31:22.505 --> 31:25.049
You rode with Pike.

31:26.926 --> 31:29.136
What kind of man are we up against?

31:29.261 --> 31:30.346
The best.

31:33.349 --> 31:34.892
He never got caught.

32:01.794 --> 32:03.796
This was going to be my last.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.718
Ain't getting around any better.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.645
I'd like to make one good score
and back off.

32:21.063 --> 32:22.481
Back off to what?

32:36.412 --> 32:38.455
Have you got anything lined up?

32:42.334 --> 32:45.921
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

32:46.922 --> 32:50.176
Every one of those garrisons
are gonna be getting a payroll.

32:51.844 --> 32:55.181
That kind of information is kind of hard
to come by.

32:55.347 --> 32:58.517
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

33:01.103 --> 33:02.813
He'll be waiting for us.

33:05.357 --> 33:07.526
I wouldn't have it any other way.

33:20.539 --> 33:22.541
Come on, Pike, let's go.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.711
You sound like you're all caught up.

33:25.878 --> 33:28.547
Caught up enough to know
we've overstayed our welcome.

33:28.714 --> 33:30.549
What the hell's the matter with you?

33:30.716 --> 33:34.136
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and not a worry in the world.

33:34.386 --> 33:37.306
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

33:37.389 --> 33:39.308
How can you be so damn sure?

33:39.892 --> 33:42.019
Being sure is my business.

33:42.394 --> 33:44.522
<i>Being sure is my business.</i>

33:48.067 --> 33:50.402
- Hold it!
- Relax.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.738
It's just some champagne we ordered.

33:53.989 --> 33:56.575
<i>Relax. It's just some champagne</i>
<i>we ordered.</i>

33:57.910 --> 34:00.037
<i>Being sure is my business.</i>

34:10.922 --> 34:12.299
Did you get him?

34:12.424 --> 34:14.009
<i>No, the bastard got away.</i>

34:16.594 --> 34:19.014
Damn, you sure must have hurt
that railroad.

34:20.431 --> 34:23.101
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

34:23.185 --> 34:24.812
I caught up with them.

34:25.603 --> 34:27.273
Two or three times.

34:27.606 --> 34:29.358
There was a man named Harrigan.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.819
He used to have a way of doing things.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.697
I made him change his ways.

34:35.781 --> 34:37.616
And a hell of a lot of people...

34:37.699 --> 34:40.119
that just can't stand to be wrong.

34:41.536 --> 34:42.705
Pride.

34:43.038 --> 34:44.790
And they can't forget it.

34:44.956 --> 34:47.835
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

34:56.302 --> 34:57.553
How about us, Pike?

34:58.721 --> 35:00.389
You reckon we learned...

35:00.472 --> 35:02.057
being wrong today?

35:04.476 --> 35:06.604
I sure hope to God we did.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.749
Them's hot.

35:31.545 --> 35:32.713
Damn!

35:36.759 --> 35:39.094
Where in the hell did you ever find him?

35:39.261 --> 35:41.263
He used to run with Thornton and me.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.266
Did his share of killing, and more.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.768
Around Langtry.

35:47.728 --> 35:51.148
Yeah, only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.803
Pike...

36:23.722 --> 36:26.225
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.586
Watch out, boys!

36:54.170 --> 36:55.671
Go on, easy.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.055
Watch it, Tector!

37:14.857 --> 37:16.942
That goddamned son of a bitch!

37:20.029 --> 37:21.197
Get those horses up!

37:21.280 --> 37:23.199
What the hell is going...

37:24.783 --> 37:26.911
Damned old punk! Bastard!

37:27.786 --> 37:30.539
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

37:36.795 --> 37:38.672
Get over here!

37:40.633 --> 37:43.260
What in the hell's the matter with you,
old man?

37:43.719 --> 37:45.137
Leave him alone!

37:46.472 --> 37:49.767
He's going to get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

37:49.850 --> 37:53.896
You're not getting rid of anybody! We're
gonna stick together, like it used to be.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.106
When you side with a man,
you stay with him.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.484
And if you can't do that,
you're like some animal!

37:58.567 --> 38:00.236
You're finished!

38:00.402 --> 38:02.571
We're finished! All of us!

38:09.578 --> 38:10.746
Mount up.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.686
Appears Brother Pike needs help,
Brother Lyle.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.980
That Brother Pike and the old man Sykes...

38:36.063 --> 38:37.982
makes a man wonder if it ain't time...

38:38.065 --> 38:40.734
to pick up his chips
and find another game.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.121
How in the hell are you going
to side anybody...

38:52.204 --> 38:54.123
when you can't even get on your horse?

40:25.923 --> 40:29.927
That was a mighty fine talk you gave the
boys back there about sticking together.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.599
That Gorch came near killing me.

40:35.766 --> 40:36.851
Or me him.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.188
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

40:41.355 --> 40:44.942
- We started together, we'll end it together.
- By God, that's the way I see it.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.611
That's the way it's always been with me.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.948
Sorry about Deke.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.075
I never figured him that way.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.121
Say, back there in Starbuck...

40:57.204 --> 40:58.873
how did my boy do?

41:00.708 --> 41:01.876
Your boy?

41:02.293 --> 41:03.377
Crazy Lee?

41:03.460 --> 41:05.504
Yes, C.L., Clarence Lee.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.883
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

41:09.049 --> 41:11.385
I kill them now? I kill them now?

41:12.469 --> 41:14.388
No, you just hold them here.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.348
<i>Hold them here.</i>

41:17.141 --> 41:19.727
Why didn't you tell me
he was your grandson?

41:20.311 --> 41:22.897
You had enough things on your mind.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.693
Besides, he had to pull his own weight
just like the rest of us.

41:28.319 --> 41:32.781
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down, run, when things got hot.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.952
No, he did fine.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.163
Just fine.

42:10.611 --> 42:11.946
All clear!

42:21.789 --> 42:24.583
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.337
What's the closest town of any size?

42:29.797 --> 42:30.965
Agua Verde.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.051
What's in Agua Verde?

42:34.218 --> 42:36.053
Mexicans, what else?

42:40.474 --> 42:43.394
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

42:43.477 --> 42:45.229
Mapache territory.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.067
Don't we follow?

42:50.401 --> 42:51.944
No, we go back and wait.

42:54.321 --> 42:56.782
- Damn it! Go find...
- Shut up!

42:57.825 --> 43:01.078
Why in the hell won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

43:01.662 --> 43:05.583
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

43:05.666 --> 43:08.836
I have invited you to my village,
to my home.

43:08.919 --> 43:11.922
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

43:12.006 --> 43:13.507
I will kill you.

43:13.674 --> 43:16.051
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

43:16.343 --> 43:19.847
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

43:19.930 --> 43:21.682
- You got a sister?
- Yes.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.268
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.353
And that of your mama too.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.898
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

43:50.211 --> 43:51.837
How bad did they hit you?

43:51.921 --> 43:55.007
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.760
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

43:58.552 --> 44:01.472
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they give you any protection?

44:01.555 --> 44:03.724
They were federal troops...

44:03.891 --> 44:06.477
commissioned by the traitor, Huerta.

44:06.977 --> 44:09.146
And the soldier who shot my father?

44:09.230 --> 44:10.689
What was his name?

44:11.065 --> 44:14.401
- What the hell difference does it make?
- Your father died like a man.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.613
Names in this matter
do not have any importance.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.281
How was he called?

44:20.658 --> 44:21.951
Mapache.

44:22.326 --> 44:23.994
That is name enough.

44:26.413 --> 44:27.665
In Mexico, <i>señor...</i>

44:28.582 --> 44:30.751
these are the years of sadness.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.336
But if we had...

44:32.920 --> 44:34.630
rifles like these...

44:34.922 --> 44:38.259
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

44:41.637 --> 44:44.515
She went with them
because she wished to.

44:45.266 --> 44:47.434
She became the woman of Mapache...

44:47.601 --> 44:50.604
and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.357
Drunk with wine and love.

44:55.109 --> 44:59.530
To him, Teresa was like a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

45:00.197 --> 45:02.533
I tell you, she was a mango...

45:02.783 --> 45:04.285
ripe and waiting.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.705
Angel dreams of love
and Mapache eats the mango.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.209
That's a good trick.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.641
Now that I find hard to believe.

45:29.768 --> 45:31.228
Not so hard.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.732
We all dream of being a child again.

45:35.232 --> 45:37.067
Even the worst of us.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.324
Perhaps the worst most of all.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.161
You know what we are, then?

45:47.244 --> 45:50.206
Yes, just so, the both of you!

45:50.915 --> 45:52.166
And you!

45:58.672 --> 46:00.382
Where is Mapache?

46:09.099 --> 46:11.352
All right, Pike? All right?

46:15.731 --> 46:17.525
Tector, let's swap!

46:17.691 --> 46:19.527
Come on, let's swap!

46:35.459 --> 46:37.962
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

46:39.380 --> 46:41.090
Why do you wish to know?

46:41.549 --> 46:42.925
For your father?

46:43.467 --> 46:44.802
Or the whore?

46:49.557 --> 46:54.144
Either you learn to live with it
or we'll leave you here.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.653
I go with you, <i>Jefe.</i>

47:32.600 --> 47:35.686
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna steal his girl.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.313
You are?

47:38.272 --> 47:39.607
Here I go.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.361
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

47:44.612 --> 47:46.155
Come on, lady!

51:08.899 --> 51:10.317
No <i>gringos?</i>

51:11.360 --> 51:12.945
Only <i>federales.</i>

51:26.083 --> 51:27.585
All soldiers.

51:27.751 --> 51:29.587
Not a bounty hunter in sight.

51:46.562 --> 51:48.731
Now, what in the hell is that?

52:18.928 --> 52:21.305
I saw one just like it in Waco.

52:22.264 --> 52:23.474
Run on steam?

52:23.641 --> 52:25.434
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.186
Hey, Pike, you know what I hear?

52:27.269 --> 52:30.981
I hear they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.609
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

52:33.776 --> 52:35.402
No, the old man's right.

52:35.486 --> 52:39.073
They've got motors and wings
and go 60 miles in less than an hour.

52:39.156 --> 52:41.325
Going to use them in the war they say.

52:42.284 --> 52:44.203
Well, let's go and talk to the General...

52:44.662 --> 52:47.498
about his automobile
and our extra horses.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.250
Nice and easy.

53:55.357 --> 53:58.194
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

54:01.363 --> 54:03.699
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

54:03.908 --> 54:06.785
With the way the <i>Generalísimo's</i>
cleaned out this part of the country...

54:06.869 --> 54:08.287
he ought to have a lot to spare.

54:08.370 --> 54:10.164
<i>Generalísimo,</i> hell.

54:10.581 --> 54:13.792
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

54:13.876 --> 54:16.045
Like some others I could mention.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.633
Not so as you'd know it, Mr. Bishop.

54:20.883 --> 54:24.845
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

54:27.598 --> 54:30.059
I hope someday
these people here kick him...

54:30.142 --> 54:32.978
and the rest of the scum like him
right into their graves.

54:33.062 --> 54:34.146
We will.

54:36.232 --> 54:37.900
If it takes forever!

55:17.439 --> 55:18.816
Look here.

55:25.781 --> 55:27.825
Pretty good-looking old pony, ain't he?

55:35.666 --> 55:38.085
Boy, do you know them beauties?

56:21.378 --> 56:22.546
Come on.

56:24.089 --> 56:26.717
- She was my woman.
- I know.

56:47.780 --> 56:50.074
Sure ain't your woman no more.

56:53.744 --> 56:56.956
Just look at her licking
inside that general's ear.

57:29.947 --> 57:32.324
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

57:33.284 --> 57:36.912
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

57:41.834 --> 57:44.879
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

57:58.559 --> 58:01.937
Are you men associated
with the American Army?

58:05.399 --> 58:08.152
No, we're not associated with anybody.

58:10.196 --> 58:11.405
I see.

58:11.864 --> 58:16.035
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

58:16.202 --> 58:19.330
is restricted for the use
of army personnel.

58:20.039 --> 58:22.750
It can't be purchased or even owned...

58:22.917 --> 58:24.084
legally.

58:24.418 --> 58:27.379
- Is that so?
- Weapons are a specialty of mine.

58:28.088 --> 58:31.634
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the Imperial German Army.

58:32.551 --> 58:36.972
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

58:37.097 --> 58:40.851
who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

58:42.061 --> 58:44.939
Well, we share very few sentiments
with our government.

58:50.611 --> 58:52.571
He's asking us to have a drink with him.

58:56.784 --> 58:57.868
Good.

59:18.097 --> 59:19.223
Shoot him.

59:31.652 --> 59:33.571
I gave it to him, T.C.

01:00:08.314 --> 01:00:11.275
- You mean here?
- No, no, not there!

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.452
Wait a minute, now,
what you going to do?

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:25.831
We got to show a little class here.

01:00:46.644 --> 01:00:48.062
Right here!

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:50.773
It must be that garrison rail spur.

01:00:51.232 --> 01:00:55.194
I know it's the easiest to hit, but I gotta
figure some way to get it out of there.

01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:58.405
What do you think, Dutch?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.741
Getting pretty close to home, ain't it?

01:01:01.242 --> 01:01:03.661
Look at them gathered around
that big table.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.666
Here we sit like kitchen help.

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:11.836
Why do you want us to hit a train
like that at the border?

01:01:11.919 --> 01:01:14.880
Can't the General just go up there
and take over the whole thing?

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.926
General Huerta is anxious to better
relations with the United States...

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:22.429
not to cross the border and destroy them.

01:01:23.264 --> 01:01:26.350
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:28.185
How'd you find out about this one?

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:30.396
Mapache has a superb intelligence force...

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:33.023
organized under supervision
of my commanding officer.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:36.861
Now, gentlemen,
we are quite well organized...

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.655
and able to pay $10,000...

01:01:40.281 --> 01:01:41.699
in gold.

01:01:42.867 --> 01:01:46.453
Of course, if you're not able
to do the work, we'll find someone else.

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:49.456
We can do it. It's just that we're
going to need special equipment.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:51.375
Do not worry.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.879
Our accountant will
take care of everything.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.425
General...

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:03.554
soon you will be the best-equipped
general in Mexico.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.640
Well, look here...

01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:09.351
ain't he the one?

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.855
To the host!

01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:27.077
With your permission, I need a bath.

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:30.414
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.168
I don't need no bath!

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:38.339
What me and Tector need is a couple
of them women you're hogging.

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:40.799
You think you can fix that up for us?

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:48.766
Gentlemen, you will excuse me, I'm sure.

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:50.518
I'm sure.

01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:58.025
- Herrera.
- Let's get Angel.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:13.457
<i>Por favor,</i> General, I need him.

01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:16.210
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:19.380
If you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:36.856
All right.

01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:40.317
He is not important to me. Take him.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.784
I think we're gonna get on the wagon now.

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:57.251
Hey, here come our sweeties.

01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:05.843
Ain't them pretty?

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:08.554
I don't know about yours, Lyle, but...

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.098
I think I got more than I can handle.

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:23.736
Hey, get out of there.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:26.447
You know what they told me?

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:30.534
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:34.330
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:37.750
I tell you, Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.630
Let's have a little target.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.466
She ain't going to get away.
Turn her loose.

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:56.018
Why not!

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:24.421
Tector, look at them beauties!

01:05:52.283 --> 01:05:54.869
How in the hell can you stand it that hot?

01:05:55.536 --> 01:05:58.956
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.380
Hell, Lyle, look here.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:15.097
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.729
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:26.567
Listen, I'm not going to steal guns for
that devil to rob and kill my people again.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:29.111
Noble, noble. Very noble.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:33.574
I didn't see no tears rolling down your
cheeks when you rode in from Starbuck.

01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:35.784
They were not my people.

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:39.079
I care about my people, my village.

01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:44.251
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

01:06:44.585 --> 01:06:46.670
If it does, you just don't go along.

01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:49.089
Then I don't go along.

01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:53.427
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

01:06:54.303 --> 01:06:57.264
Why, you ought to be thinking about
all the money you're gonna have.

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:59.934
Buy them a ranch. Move them 1,000 miles.

01:07:00.267 --> 01:07:02.853
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:05.356
A very small one.

01:07:05.606 --> 01:07:08.192
Don't you see? This is their land.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.945
No one is going to drive them away.

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:13.364
I'll drink to that sentiment.

01:07:13.531 --> 01:07:14.990
And to love.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:18.619
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:36.178
Angel.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:38.889
You're a pain in the ass.

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:42.810
Would you give guns to someone
to kill your father...

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.229
or your mother, or your brother?

01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:48.774
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot
of family ties.

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.485
My people have no guns.

01:07:53.154 --> 01:07:54.822
But with guns...

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.741
my people could fight.

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:01.287
If I could take guns...

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:03.664
I would come with you.

01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:08.586
Say, how many cases of rifles
did Zamorra say was in that shipment?

01:08:08.669 --> 01:08:09.962
Sixteen.

01:08:10.254 --> 01:08:11.297
Well...

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.592
give him one.

01:08:26.604 --> 01:08:27.854
All right.

01:08:28.522 --> 01:08:33.152
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.196
I will.

01:08:35.529 --> 01:08:39.033
- We know you will.
- Sure glad we got that settled.

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.286
Why, you reprobate!

01:08:58.886 --> 01:09:00.136
Boys...

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.809
I want you to meet my fiancée.

01:09:07.728 --> 01:09:09.647
They just got engaged.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.564
I'm a son of a bitch!

01:09:12.233 --> 01:09:14.068
Trot them on in, fellas.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.823
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:28.832
You want to gamble everything
that this one shipment will be attacked?

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:31.585
If they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.

01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:35.089
- If? What about Juarez?
- If he was, we would've heard about it.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.091
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:39.926
And who in the hell is Mapache?

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.846
A killer for Huerta who
calls himself a general.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.849
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

01:09:44.932 --> 01:09:48.435
But with enough guns, he could become
a power in northern Mexico.

01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:50.688
My guess is,
Pike will try to get them for him.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.274
How can he? The train will be guarded
by regular troops.

01:09:53.357 --> 01:09:56.819
Not regular troops,
green recruits not worth a damn.

01:09:57.194 --> 01:09:59.822
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:03.367
And not this
gutter trash you've given me.

01:10:04.952 --> 01:10:07.872
What you've got is 24 more days.

01:10:21.177 --> 01:10:24.221
Never told me how you got
all torn up like that.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.891
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

01:10:44.033 --> 01:10:46.994
- Is your husband coming back?
- No.

01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:49.246
He's never coming back.

01:10:53.918 --> 01:10:55.544
But you are late.

01:10:56.212 --> 01:10:57.546
Two days late.

01:10:57.713 --> 01:10:59.173
<i>She had a husband.</i>

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:01.884
If I'd had any sense, I'd have killed him.

01:11:04.553 --> 01:11:06.222
<i>He wasn't around.</i>

01:11:06.597 --> 01:11:08.182
<i>I got careless.</i>

01:11:09.225 --> 01:11:10.976
<i>One night, he walked in on us.</i>

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:15.064
<i>Got her with the first shot,</i>
<i>and got me here with the second.</i>

01:11:15.439 --> 01:11:17.441
<i>Then the damn coward turned and ran.</i>

01:11:38.587 --> 01:11:40.297
Ever catch up with him?

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:44.969
No, but there isn't a day or an hour
that passes that I don't think about it.

01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:48.514
Come on, pretty! We've got a long way!

01:11:49.807 --> 01:11:52.143
This is our last go around, Dutch.

01:11:52.601 --> 01:11:54.728
This time, we do it right.

01:13:45.256 --> 01:13:46.715
Just do your work.

01:17:41.909 --> 01:17:43.077
Let's go!

01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:16.360
They're coming!

01:18:30.374 --> 01:18:31.792
They're coming!

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:34.003
Faster!

01:18:50.144 --> 01:18:51.228
Get over!

01:20:16.355 --> 01:20:20.067
Get that ramp up!
Get that horse out of here!

01:20:20.359 --> 01:20:22.695
Bring them all out! Get them out!

01:20:23.028 --> 01:20:24.572
Get over here!

01:20:24.738 --> 01:20:28.284
Get them over here! Get those horses!

01:21:03.611 --> 01:21:04.695
Hurry up!

01:21:04.778 --> 01:21:06.322
Your horse kicked me.

01:21:06.405 --> 01:21:08.115
Run them up along here!

01:21:08.574 --> 01:21:10.409
Where the hell is my horse?

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:19.293
Hey, we got grenades!

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.213
- Hurry up! We gotta get out of here!
- Be careful with this, boys!

01:21:22.421 --> 01:21:24.131
Let's go on this.

01:21:29.762 --> 01:21:30.971
Here we go.

01:21:33.641 --> 01:21:36.060
All right, line up in a column of twos!

01:21:37.311 --> 01:21:39.647
Corporal, give us a hand here!

01:21:41.357 --> 01:21:44.276
Hey, Pike, we're all ready!

01:22:32.324 --> 01:22:33.659
Let's go!

01:22:36.829 --> 01:22:37.955
Come on!

01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:44.313
Get after that horse!

01:23:44.396 --> 01:23:46.148
That was my horse!

01:23:46.816 --> 01:23:48.067
Get after him!

01:23:49.693 --> 01:23:50.903
You men get out!

01:23:52.738 --> 01:23:55.157
Get that damn horse off my butt!

01:23:55.574 --> 01:23:57.993
Get those horses out of here!
The train's coming back!

01:23:58.077 --> 01:23:59.286
Train?

01:23:59.662 --> 01:24:01.664
- Where?
- What train?

01:24:01.747 --> 01:24:03.249
I don't see any train.

01:24:08.254 --> 01:24:10.756
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!

01:24:39.785 --> 01:24:43.038
Corporal, ride back to the telegraph
at Todos Malos...

01:24:43.205 --> 01:24:46.041
and tell the railroad deputies
they robbed the train...

01:24:46.125 --> 01:24:47.710
and we're in pursuit!

01:24:47.793 --> 01:24:49.044
Yes, sir!

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:55.801
Come on!

01:25:52.691 --> 01:25:53.734
Dutch!

01:26:15.798 --> 01:26:17.383
Damn son of a...

01:26:18.717 --> 01:26:20.469
Come on! It's lit!

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.648
Get them horses going!

01:26:52.418 --> 01:26:54.503
Don't shoot at the army, you idiots!

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.473
Come on, Pike!

01:28:08.994 --> 01:28:10.329
Let's go!

01:28:15.167 --> 01:28:17.002
Come on, you lazy bastard!

01:28:17.169 --> 01:28:19.004
I'm coming, damn it!

01:28:36.355 --> 01:28:38.440
- Is it all right?
- Yep.

01:28:39.191 --> 01:28:41.193
Where are they supposed to meet us?

01:28:41.277 --> 01:28:43.112
Agua Verde or before.

01:28:43.279 --> 01:28:47.032
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.

01:28:47.366 --> 01:28:49.869
Least we won't have to worry
about Deke Thornton.

01:28:50.452 --> 01:28:54.498
Hell, no. Not after riding a half a case
of dynamite into the river.

01:28:54.707 --> 01:28:58.794
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.

01:31:15.598 --> 01:31:18.684
I sure would like to get hold
of that fool horse of mine.

01:31:18.851 --> 01:31:21.770
Some Mex kid's probably riding him home
right now.

01:31:21.937 --> 01:31:24.857
I don't see how I could've lost
both my boots.

01:31:25.524 --> 01:31:27.526
They always were hard as hell to get on.

01:31:27.610 --> 01:31:29.278
That damn river sucked them right off.

01:31:29.361 --> 01:31:31.447
That damn dynamite helped some.

01:31:31.614 --> 01:31:35.534
Maybe the same kid that's riding T.C.'s
horse is wearing your boots right now.

01:31:36.952 --> 01:31:38.704
You stupid bastards!

01:31:38.871 --> 01:31:41.040
Why did you fire at those soldiers?

01:31:41.624 --> 01:31:45.044
Huey started firing at them.
I even tried to stop him.

01:31:45.127 --> 01:31:47.838
- One of the bandits...
- Don't blame it on me!

01:31:47.922 --> 01:31:49.131
Liar!

01:31:49.298 --> 01:31:50.883
Shut your mouths!

01:31:51.592 --> 01:31:53.052
Are we going after them?

01:31:53.135 --> 01:31:55.805
We are,
unless you want to face a firing squad.

01:31:58.474 --> 01:32:00.017
Come on, T. C!

01:32:00.601 --> 01:32:02.394
Why the hell do we have to leave now?

01:32:02.812 --> 01:32:04.146
Besides, my hair's wet!

01:32:40.933 --> 01:32:43.853
Impossible! We have no arms
or ammunition.

01:33:49.418 --> 01:33:52.922
The <i>gringos</i> assaulted the train!
They got the guns.

01:33:56.425 --> 01:33:57.843
We must go!

01:33:59.345 --> 01:34:02.598
Take the necessary people
and take the road to Agua Verde.

01:34:02.681 --> 01:34:06.018
Convince the <i>gringos</i> to give you the guns.
I'll wait for you in the village.

01:34:06.101 --> 01:34:07.561
If the <i>gringos</i> refuse?

01:35:33.105 --> 01:35:34.940
He's still heading east.

01:35:37.485 --> 01:35:40.237
Are they bluffing,
or did they really miss it?

01:35:44.867 --> 01:35:48.245
I'd say they missed it. Here, take a look.

01:35:51.373 --> 01:35:53.042
There's only five left.

01:36:01.383 --> 01:36:04.303
- Hell, we lost them.
- I don't see how we lost them.

01:36:04.386 --> 01:36:07.515
Unless it was in the big valley
where the ground was hard.

01:36:07.598 --> 01:36:12.102
Wasn't but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this here is it.

01:36:12.269 --> 01:36:13.979
They didn't take it out.

01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:17.399
And we haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.

01:36:17.566 --> 01:36:19.235
Sit still, damn it!

01:36:19.568 --> 01:36:22.321
You think Pike and old Sykes
haven't been watching us?

01:36:22.404 --> 01:36:25.074
They know what this is all about.
And what do I have?

01:36:25.407 --> 01:36:28.410
Nothing but you egg-sucking,
chicken-stealing gutter trash...

01:36:28.577 --> 01:36:30.871
with not even 60 rounds between you.

01:36:30.955 --> 01:36:32.623
We're after men.

01:36:33.123 --> 01:36:35.417
And I wish to God I was with them.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.755
The next time you make a mistake,
I'm gonna ride off and let you die.

01:36:41.799 --> 01:36:42.883
Come on.

01:36:51.183 --> 01:36:54.186
I never figured they'd come down here
after us.

01:36:54.812 --> 01:36:56.605
How much you reckon we could be worth?

01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:58.691
Depends on how hungry they are.

01:37:02.987 --> 01:37:05.823
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.

01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:08.492
I'll go down and
start rigging the fireworks.

01:37:08.659 --> 01:37:09.827
All right.

01:37:12.913 --> 01:37:13.956
Angel...

01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:17.793
get that case of explosives
off the back there!

01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:19.211
Lyle...

01:37:20.004 --> 01:37:22.298
hand me down those blasting caps.

01:37:29.805 --> 01:37:32.224
What're you gonna do with the dynamite?

01:37:33.517 --> 01:37:37.438
I figure that damn general will try
to take this load without paying for it...

01:37:37.521 --> 01:37:39.565
and shoot us in the bargain.

01:37:40.566 --> 01:37:44.570
The only thing to change his mind
is if something happened to these guns.

01:37:44.653 --> 01:37:46.989
I'm gonna make sure
something could happen.

01:37:47.072 --> 01:37:49.200
Pike, take a look at this.

01:37:50.659 --> 01:37:52.203
Think you can handle that?

01:37:54.163 --> 01:37:57.249
What I don't know about,
I sure as hell am going to learn.

01:39:06.986 --> 01:39:09.155
My people are here for their guns.

01:39:14.577 --> 01:39:16.996
Where the hell were you when you were
supposed to be guarding us.

01:39:17.079 --> 01:39:19.623
I never heard them, didn't even see them.

01:39:33.429 --> 01:39:37.600
They apologize and ask you
to forgive them for their lack of trust.

01:39:38.184 --> 01:39:40.853
But only by caution do they remain alive.

01:39:46.275 --> 01:39:48.527
Tell them not to break that fuse.

01:39:51.113 --> 01:39:53.115
These people from your village?

01:39:53.199 --> 01:39:55.951
They are part of the village,
but not from it.

01:39:56.368 --> 01:40:00.456
They are <i>puro Indio</i> and these mountains
belong to them.

01:40:23.312 --> 01:40:26.398
I'd say those fellows know
how to handle themselves.

01:40:26.565 --> 01:40:30.402
They've been fighting Apaches
for 1,000 years. That's a sure way to learn.

01:40:30.569 --> 01:40:34.573
If they ever get armed, with good leaders,
this whole country will go up in smoke.

01:40:34.657 --> 01:40:37.159
That it will, son. That it will.

01:40:38.077 --> 01:40:40.913
They made damn fools out of us,
Mr. Bishop.

01:40:42.414 --> 01:40:45.584
Getting so a fella can't sleep
with both eyes closed...

01:40:45.668 --> 01:40:47.419
for fear of getting his throat cut.

01:40:47.503 --> 01:40:48.796
Where in the hell were you?

01:40:48.921 --> 01:40:50.589
Now, you listen to me, Lyle.

01:40:50.756 --> 01:40:53.175
If you got up off your ass and helped
once in a while...

01:40:53.259 --> 01:40:55.219
I wouldn't have got caught near so easy.

01:41:11.193 --> 01:41:14.738
With the new guns and ammunition,
this could never have happened.

01:41:40.890 --> 01:41:43.142
Swing your leaders wide, old man!

01:41:43.309 --> 01:41:44.852
Bring them on!

01:41:59.742 --> 01:42:01.243
Come on, horse!

01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:17.593
- Hold up!
- Whoa there!

01:42:20.095 --> 01:42:21.222
Mapache's?

01:42:21.764 --> 01:42:23.808
Let's just hope they don't belong to Villa.

01:42:37.363 --> 01:42:38.948
We are friends.

01:42:39.281 --> 01:42:41.367
We are from <i>el General Mapache.</i>

01:42:41.951 --> 01:42:43.786
Tell the one out in front
to come over here.

01:42:43.869 --> 01:42:45.079
Alone.

01:42:50.876 --> 01:42:52.336
I am coming.

01:42:52.711 --> 01:42:54.547
I am your friend, remember?

01:42:57.883 --> 01:43:00.344
We are friends. All of us.

01:43:01.637 --> 01:43:04.723
I bring you love and affection
from <i>el General.</i>

01:43:08.727 --> 01:43:10.980
You bring the guns with you?

01:43:13.983 --> 01:43:16.068
What bravery you have done!

01:43:17.069 --> 01:43:19.572
I am to escort you to the <i>General.</i>

01:43:21.407 --> 01:43:24.285
- Tell him to come closer.
- I hear.

01:43:25.244 --> 01:43:27.246
I am coming, my friend.

01:43:31.167 --> 01:43:32.460
You know what this is?

01:43:41.427 --> 01:43:44.722
Any trouble, no guns for the General.

01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:52.688
Very smart!

01:43:52.938 --> 01:43:55.733
That's very smart for you damn <i>gringos.</i>

01:43:56.358 --> 01:43:58.194
So nobody can rob the guns.

01:43:58.944 --> 01:44:00.112
Nobody.

01:44:00.362 --> 01:44:03.866
I am not afraid. They are not afraid.

01:44:04.033 --> 01:44:08.120
You blow up the wagon, you die.
Or we kill you pretty soon.

01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:11.916
- But we are <i>amigos.</i>
- Show them, boys.

01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:26.722
Start the ball, Tector.

01:44:36.148 --> 01:44:38.275
Please, cut the fuse.

01:44:43.989 --> 01:44:45.115
Please.

01:45:19.942 --> 01:45:23.112
<i>El General</i> waits in Agua Verde
to meet with you.

01:45:23.279 --> 01:45:26.782
Tell the General one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.

01:45:27.533 --> 01:45:30.244
Any trouble, no guns.

01:45:44.842 --> 01:45:46.760
Damn <i>gringos!</i>

01:46:22.338 --> 01:46:24.882
Get them up there, Freddie!
Pull them over!

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.670
You bring the guns?

01:47:02.962 --> 01:47:04.964
Don't worry, we've got them.

01:47:05.714 --> 01:47:06.799
Hidden.

01:47:08.968 --> 01:47:12.304
When I get my share of the gold,
$2,500 worth...

01:47:12.471 --> 01:47:14.807
I'll tell you where four cases are.

01:47:16.142 --> 01:47:18.811
The others are waiting for me
back at the wagon.

01:47:19.145 --> 01:47:22.022
If I don't show up pretty quick,
they'll blow it.

01:47:22.398 --> 01:47:26.026
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fooled me.

01:47:27.653 --> 01:47:30.531
Our accountant will pay you immediately.

01:47:31.907 --> 01:47:33.576
When do we get our guns?

01:47:33.742 --> 01:47:37.079
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.

01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:42.501
Open it up.

01:47:54.597 --> 01:47:57.016
Up the arroyo, about two miles...

01:47:57.183 --> 01:47:59.602
you'll find three cases of rifles...

01:47:59.852 --> 01:48:02.730
and one case of ammunition
hidden in the bush behind them.

01:48:10.529 --> 01:48:12.823
I understand you have a machine gun.

01:48:15.367 --> 01:48:18.370
Our contract called for 16 cases of rifles...

01:48:18.537 --> 01:48:20.873
and ammunition for $10,000.

01:48:21.165 --> 01:48:22.833
Not a machine gun.

01:48:26.337 --> 01:48:28.547
That's our present to the General.

01:48:31.175 --> 01:48:33.552
<i>Gringo,</i> you fight with Mapache...

01:48:38.057 --> 01:48:39.600
I'll think about it.

01:48:41.393 --> 01:48:43.729
In case he don't find them...

01:48:44.146 --> 01:48:47.024
Go. I trust him.

01:49:12.716 --> 01:49:16.345
- Why the hell don't you stir up some grub?
- Why don't you go to hell?

01:49:29.942 --> 01:49:31.110
Shit!

01:49:33.445 --> 01:49:34.613
Damn it!

01:49:36.115 --> 01:49:39.201
Damn it, Pike must've found you
under a rock.

01:49:39.952 --> 01:49:41.412
You gonna whip me?

01:49:41.912 --> 01:49:42.955
Nope.

01:49:43.122 --> 01:49:45.958
But you better just hope
I don't get riled enough...

01:49:46.125 --> 01:49:48.544
to start dogging you when this is over.

01:49:48.919 --> 01:49:52.256
You're not going to get a chance
to dry gulch me, old man.

01:49:52.590 --> 01:49:53.966
We'll see.

01:49:55.092 --> 01:49:56.302
We'll see.

01:49:57.761 --> 01:49:59.305
Pike's coming!

01:50:05.102 --> 01:50:07.354
He's got it. Carrying gold.

01:50:09.482 --> 01:50:10.941
Any trouble?

01:50:11.108 --> 01:50:13.110
Just from carrying this weight.

01:50:15.154 --> 01:50:17.531
- Pike, I want to go next.
- All right.

01:50:17.615 --> 01:50:20.743
You and your brother take the next load,
along with the machine gun.

01:50:20.826 --> 01:50:25.122
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie,
you follow and pick up the pack horses.

01:50:32.463 --> 01:50:35.549
It must be mounted on a tripod!

01:50:36.967 --> 01:50:40.638
It must be mounted on a tripod!

01:51:04.203 --> 01:51:05.788
Crazy bastards!

01:52:23.949 --> 01:52:25.826
Put it on the tripod!

01:52:48.599 --> 01:52:51.185
We brought the last of it, General.

01:53:11.205 --> 01:53:13.707
At the head of the arroyo, in the wagon.

01:53:22.174 --> 01:53:24.552
You can have the wagon,
we'll take the horses.

01:53:27.179 --> 01:53:29.849
How many cases did you take
from the train?

01:53:30.641 --> 01:53:33.978
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.

01:53:34.687 --> 01:53:36.063
He stole it.

01:53:36.856 --> 01:53:39.525
The mother of the girl he killed told me so.

01:54:39.126 --> 01:54:41.045
Well, I'm wasting time here.

01:54:50.971 --> 01:54:53.224
He's a thief. You take care of him.

01:55:50.322 --> 01:55:52.074
Well, he had guts.

01:55:52.867 --> 01:55:54.702
We're just lucky he didn't talk.

01:55:55.161 --> 01:55:57.830
He played his string right out to the end.

01:56:05.671 --> 01:56:09.592
Her own mama turned him in
like some kind of a Judas.

01:56:09.675 --> 01:56:11.635
Sykes says we ought to go after him.

01:56:11.719 --> 01:56:15.055
How in the hell are we gonna do that?
They got guns and 200 men.

01:56:16.182 --> 01:56:17.433
No way.

01:56:18.184 --> 01:56:19.727
No way at all.

01:56:20.853 --> 01:56:22.354
Is that Sykes?

01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:49.882
Mapache!

01:56:53.427 --> 01:56:54.512
Thornton.

01:56:59.099 --> 01:57:00.434
I got him.

01:57:04.271 --> 01:57:05.689
They got Freddie.

01:57:07.441 --> 01:57:09.151
Looks like he's hit pretty bad.

01:57:09.235 --> 01:57:11.403
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!

01:57:11.946 --> 01:57:14.824
What would you do in his place?
He gave his word.

01:57:14.907 --> 01:57:17.034
Gave his word to a railroad.

01:57:17.118 --> 01:57:18.285
It's his word!

01:57:18.369 --> 01:57:21.622
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!

01:57:28.462 --> 01:57:30.923
We can stay up here
and kick hell out of them!

01:57:31.006 --> 01:57:32.508
That's what we can do.

01:57:36.137 --> 01:57:38.180
No, we're running short of water.

01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:40.933
Make a run for the border?

01:57:42.810 --> 01:57:46.021
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.

01:57:46.605 --> 01:57:48.607
I'm tired of being hunted.

01:57:49.817 --> 01:57:53.445
Let's go back to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.

01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:56.031
You're crazy.

01:57:57.950 --> 01:58:00.578
That general would just as soon kill us
as break wind.

01:58:00.786 --> 01:58:02.580
He's so tickled with those guns...

01:58:02.663 --> 01:58:05.499
he'll be celebrating for a week
and happy to do us a favor.

01:58:05.833 --> 01:58:08.169
Thornton's not gonna follow us in there.

01:58:09.336 --> 01:58:11.589
While they're busy picking over Freddie...

01:58:11.672 --> 01:58:14.675
we'll find a back trail off this mountain
and head for town.

01:58:18.179 --> 01:58:19.847
What about our gold?

01:58:27.313 --> 01:58:29.815
We'll take one sack to pay our way.

01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:31.901
Bury the rest.

01:58:35.488 --> 01:58:36.655
Together.

01:58:56.008 --> 01:58:57.259
Look out!

01:59:04.767 --> 01:59:07.686
Lots of blood, then it stops. No track.

01:59:08.103 --> 01:59:12.066
- $10 says he's dead by now.
- Take us a day to find him if he is.

01:59:12.775 --> 01:59:15.110
If he isn't, he has a gun on us right now.

01:59:20.115 --> 01:59:21.617
Let's go after the others.

01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:24.370
Just leave him here? He's worth money.

01:59:25.121 --> 01:59:28.290
Yes, you ride out tomorrow,
that is if you can stay on your horse...

01:59:28.374 --> 01:59:31.043
and watch the buzzards.
They'll show you where he is.

01:59:31.127 --> 01:59:32.753
What if he ain't dead, Mr. Thornton?

01:59:33.462 --> 01:59:35.965
That's your problem. Let's go!

02:01:08.224 --> 02:01:11.644
- God, I hate to see that.
- No more than I do.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.837
Welcome, <i>amigos!</i>
You come for your friend, no?

02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:49.849
I want to buy him back.

02:01:54.937 --> 02:01:57.523
I don't think he looks worth too much.

02:02:04.446 --> 02:02:06.448
I don't think he's going to live too long.

02:02:06.699 --> 02:02:08.701
I'll give you half of my share for him.

02:02:08.784 --> 02:02:12.288
I need no gold and I don't sell this one.

02:02:12.371 --> 02:02:14.206
Why not? You've had your fun with him.

02:02:14.290 --> 02:02:16.876
<i>El Generalísimo's</i> happy with the guns.

02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:19.378
Why don't you go and get a drink?

02:02:19.545 --> 02:02:22.298
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.

02:02:26.886 --> 02:02:29.221
Don't be foolish and change his mood.

02:03:11.764 --> 02:03:13.349
Son of a bitch!

02:03:25.945 --> 02:03:27.238
Why not?

02:03:42.128 --> 02:03:43.796
There ain't nobody here!

02:03:43.879 --> 02:03:47.258
There's wagon tracks
and somebody was here!

02:03:47.341 --> 02:03:49.093
They sure as hell ain't here now!

02:03:55.391 --> 02:03:56.851
Army patrol!

02:03:57.726 --> 02:03:59.061
Coming this way!

02:06:33.966 --> 02:06:35.885
You said <i>dos</i> for two!

02:06:35.968 --> 02:06:38.220
Here's your <i>dos</i> and one to grow on.

02:06:38.387 --> 02:06:40.806
That's all you're gonna get out of me.

02:07:13.005 --> 02:07:14.340
Let's go.

02:07:25.768 --> 02:07:27.061
Why not?

02:11:11.952 --> 02:11:13.370
What do you want?

02:11:18.459 --> 02:11:19.794
We want Angel.

02:11:21.670 --> 02:11:26.509
You want Angel, no? All right.
I'm going to give him to you.

02:15:29.293 --> 02:15:30.419
Bitch!

02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:56.529
Come on, you lazy bastard!

02:16:32.647 --> 02:16:34.525
Give them hell, Pike!

02:16:41.156 --> 02:16:42.491
No, Pike!

02:16:46.787 --> 02:16:47.830
Pike.

02:16:54.170 --> 02:16:55.212
Pike.

02:17:37.797 --> 02:17:39.215
Look at them.

02:17:39.965 --> 02:17:41.842
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

02:17:43.677 --> 02:17:44.719
Wait for me!

02:17:44.804 --> 02:17:47.639
- Come on, let's get all the guns.
- This is fine!

02:17:48.057 --> 02:17:50.558
This is just like a big old picnic!

02:17:50.809 --> 02:17:52.727
Here's a rifle for you.

02:18:21.924 --> 02:18:23.424
He's got a gun.

02:18:25.928 --> 02:18:28.763
T.C., it's them!

02:18:30.516 --> 02:18:32.351
It's the Gorches!

02:18:33.102 --> 02:18:34.937
Get up there, Coffer. Come on.

02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:37.647
Mr. Thornton, it's them.

02:18:38.357 --> 02:18:39.775
It is them.

02:18:43.361 --> 02:18:46.531
Here's a boy's got some gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.

02:18:46.699 --> 02:18:48.784
- Here.
- Let me see your knife!

02:18:48.868 --> 02:18:49.910
Mr. Thornton.

02:18:52.788 --> 02:18:54.248
Should we load up?

02:18:55.207 --> 02:18:57.376
Are we going to wait for Jess
or meet him on the way?

02:18:57.543 --> 02:19:01.797
If he's waiting for them buzzards to lead
him to old Sykes, he's got a long wait.

02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:03.591
Look! We got them all.

02:19:03.799 --> 02:19:06.635
T.C., there he is.

02:19:06.718 --> 02:19:08.137
There's Pike.

02:19:08.471 --> 02:19:11.724
There, you ain't so damned much now,
are you, Mr. Pike?

02:19:19.315 --> 02:19:20.816
You ain't coming?

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:24.403
No.

02:19:27.490 --> 02:19:29.492
Maybe we ought to wait here for Jess.

02:19:31.075 --> 02:19:33.329
No, we pick him up on the way.

02:19:33.495 --> 02:19:35.414
I want to get out of this damn place.

02:19:35.498 --> 02:19:38.584
Anyway, these boys'll start
going ripe on us by tomorrow.

02:19:38.666 --> 02:19:40.169
We got to move.

02:19:43.422 --> 02:19:46.424
<i>I went to the river</i>
<i>and I couldn't get across</i>

02:19:46.592 --> 02:19:49.386
<i>Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day</i>

02:19:49.678 --> 02:19:52.765
<i>I jumped on a buzzard 'cause</i>
<i>I thought he was a horse</i>

02:19:52.932 --> 02:19:55.601
<i>Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day</i>

02:19:55.768 --> 02:19:57.353
<i>Fare thee well</i>

02:21:29.278 --> 02:21:32.198
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?

02:21:32.865 --> 02:21:34.450
I sent them back.

02:21:35.117 --> 02:21:38.954
- That's all I said I'd do.
- They didn't get very far.

02:21:39.288 --> 02:21:40.414
I figured.

02:21:44.126 --> 02:21:45.961
What are your plans?

02:21:47.046 --> 02:21:50.424
Drift around down here.
Try to stay out of jail.

02:21:51.801 --> 02:21:54.220
Well, me and the boys here...

02:21:55.387 --> 02:21:56.847
we got some work to do.

02:22:01.310 --> 02:22:02.561
You want to come along?

02:22:04.730 --> 02:22:08.400
Ain't like it used to be, but it'll do.

02:24:46.851 --> 02:24:48.185
