00:12.646 --> 00:15.047
On this episode
Of "Mythbusters,"

00:15.049 --> 00:18.650
Jon and brian get their spy on.

00:18.652 --> 00:23.722
With three ingenious
Makeshift booby traps.

00:24.991 --> 00:26.191
We're testing the movie myth.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.326
Where a secret agent
Shoots a nail...

00:28.328 --> 00:29.528
Pah!

00:29.530 --> 00:32.531
From a fire extinguisher...

00:32.533 --> 00:33.598
Into a bad guy.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.667
Let's shoot him!

00:35.669 --> 00:39.003
Secondly, is it possible to use
Light bulbs in shotgun shelves.

00:39.005 --> 00:42.407
To make fragmentation grenades
Out of a chandelier?

00:42.409 --> 00:43.942
- Three, two...
- let's play with some fire.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.276
One!

00:45.278 --> 00:47.146
And finally...

00:47.148 --> 00:49.414
We're testing the myth that you
Can make an effective booby trap.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.950
By hiding shotgun shells
Under a floorboard.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.088
Ooh!

01:16.777 --> 01:19.844

01:19.846 --> 01:22.848
Captions paid for by
Discovery communications

01:22.850 --> 01:26.251
firing up first on
The secret agent agenda...

01:26.253 --> 01:30.788
Some nail gun fun from
The movie "The bourne legacy."

01:30.790 --> 01:32.991
We're testing the movie myth
Where a secret agent.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.927
Is being ambushed
Inside a house.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.595
He's completely unarmed, so
He needs some kind of upper hand.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.866
Against his opponent
Who has a submachine gun.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.935
Now, in true ingenious fashion,
He finds a fire extinguisher,

01:43.937 --> 01:47.272
Pulls off the nozzle,
Puts a duplex nail into it.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.008
And just at the right moment.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.344
Fires the nail into
The bad guy's shoulder,

01:52.346 --> 01:57.282
Giving him just enough time
To finish him off mano a mano.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.217
One of the things
This scene doesn't reveal.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.552
Is what type
Of fire extinguisher.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.354
Our secret agent is using.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.621
So that's where we got to start.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.490
Compare and contrast
Different types of household.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.292
Different fire extinguishers
And determine.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.094
Which one is best For this myth.

02:09.096 --> 02:12.364
All right.
Let's go rollerblading.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.832
Come on.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.433
God.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.169
We're going to try to fire
A duplex nail.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.704
From a fire extinguisher.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.372
That's not too bad.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.640
How do you turn?

02:23.043 --> 02:24.376
To do that, we need something
Called thrust potential,

02:24.378 --> 02:27.045
Which would be different in each
One of the extinguishers.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.582
Your barriers work.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.317
So I came up
With the awesome idea.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.921
To strap myself
Into these rollerblades...

02:35.923 --> 02:38.123
How do you do the thing
Where they spin?

02:38.125 --> 02:39.924
This will be the second time

02:39.926 --> 02:41.727
I've ever put
Rollerblades on my feet.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.328
And test Each fire extinguisher.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.863
And see if it
Potentially rockets me.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.264
Across the shop floor.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.665
Go, go, go, go, go!

02:47.667 --> 02:49.067
Go, go, go.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.336
Go Yeah!

02:51.338 --> 02:53.605
Here we go. Test the pads.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.141
All right.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.410
If it can move me,
It can definitely move a nail.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.746
This is Going to be great.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.280
Good job.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.548
- Who's a good girl?
- Good girl.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.484
Okay. Good job, bo. Yeah. Okay.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.487
All right. Here we go.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.754
These are the three
Fire extinguishers.

03:09.756 --> 03:10.822
We'll be working with.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.958
We have a water,
Dry chemical, and a co2.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.461
I'm going to hold it
With my hand like this.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.166
That's my technique
If things go bad, "".

03:21.168 --> 03:23.368
And it won't hit me right
In the or anything.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.103
Ready?

03:25.105 --> 03:27.038
All right. Here we go.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.043
Fire extinguisher thrust test
Using water in three, two, one.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.579
Here we go!

03:33.581 --> 03:34.980
Am I going?

03:34.982 --> 03:37.916
Keep going, jon!
You're doing great.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.519
It doesn't feel Very fast.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.988
Whoo!

03:42.990 --> 03:44.322
I'm going to... hold on.
I'm a little thirsty.

03:44.324 --> 03:47.792
Just... thank you, sir.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.328
H2o was a nogo.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.063
No thrust means
It can't have been.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.267
The extinguisher
Used in the movie.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.201
Next up, the dry chemical.

03:57.203 --> 04:00.338
In three, two, one.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.146
It's more impressive
And makes a mess.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.749
But also provides no thrust.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.617
Cue the co2.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.886
Three, two, one.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.690
Go, you're building Up speed!

04:19.692 --> 04:21.293
Keep going!

04:21.295 --> 04:23.161
You're moving!

04:23.163 --> 04:26.297
It's clear when it comes
To turning a fire extinguisher.

04:26.299 --> 04:31.303
Into a nail gun,
There's only one candidate.

04:31.305 --> 04:35.307
That was cold
Right in this area.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.643
So we know which extinguisher
Is most likely to provide.

04:38.645 --> 04:42.247
The trust,
But will it fire a nail?

04:42.249 --> 04:44.382
So with the standard,
Pressurized fire extinguisher,

04:44.384 --> 04:46.918
If you remove this cone here,

04:46.920 --> 04:48.520
You'll find that valve
Right there.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.655
Now, that's called a flow
Regulator, and it makes sure.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.924
The co2 comes out at a safe
And controlled rate.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.128
But with that there,
A nail can't go in.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.062
However, in the movie
When we see the closeup.

04:58.064 --> 05:01.199
Of the nail being inserted,
There's no flow regulator valve.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.600
Now, we don't know
Why it isn't there.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.070
Maybe our hero cut it off,
But the important thing is,

05:05.072 --> 05:06.871
If you do cut that valve off,

05:06.873 --> 05:09.341
This tube looks exactly like
The one in the movie does,

05:09.343 --> 05:13.545
And the duplex nail,
Boop, slides right in.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.347
Okay.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.815
Which begs the question...

05:16.817 --> 05:18.283
Without the nail in place,

05:18.285 --> 05:22.087
What difference does
The flow regulator make?

05:22.089 --> 05:23.821
- This feels like a trap.
- It's for science.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.757
Here we go. Ready?

05:25.759 --> 05:28.794
Three, two, one.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.367
There's A clear difference.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.569
- Whoa!
- One.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.574
Man.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.981
The difference between
An unmodified and modified.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.450
Fire extinguisher is dramatic.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.718
One.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.986
Ooh.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.988
Dude, that sent me
Back a couple steps.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.590
That's pretty nuts.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.526
Even though we're just going off
What we saw in the movie,

06:01.528 --> 06:04.062
Cutting off that little
Regulator dramatically increased.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.531
The thrust
On our fire extinguisher.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.672
That's dangerous, And I like it.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.608
Those are Murder giggles.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.345
A fire extinguisher
Gave me murder giggles.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.948
If we had done that when I was
Doing my initial thrust tests,

06:22.950 --> 06:25.016
I probably would have
Went across the shop.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.152
Or up the stairs
And out the door,

06:27.154 --> 06:29.554
So I'm kind of glad we didn't.

06:29.556 --> 06:34.693
So they have their modified
Extinguisher ready to roll.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.295
But before they start
Firing nails,

06:37.297 --> 06:40.298
Cue spy movie myth number two.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.603
When it comes
To hitech gadgetry,

06:45.605 --> 06:49.674
Nobody does it better
Than bond, james bond.

06:52.712 --> 06:56.381
But in "Skyfall,"
Bond and m are under siege.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.785
And have to improvise
With homemade booby traps.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.654
M takes a hammer
To several light bulbs,

07:02.656 --> 07:06.458
Inserts the stillworking
Filaments into shotgun shells,

07:06.460 --> 07:09.394
Ties them into bags
Of nuts and bolts,

07:09.396 --> 07:11.530
Screws them
Back into the chandelier.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.934
And instant
Fragmentation grenade.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.006
Man, I can't believe
After all these years.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.741
Of james bond books And movies,

07:22.743 --> 07:25.343
We finally get to see
M being a badass in "Skyfall,".

07:25.345 --> 07:26.945
But what about Our booby trap?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.481
She essentially created a series
Of fragmentation grenades.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.815
That hang From a chandelier.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.150
Sounds like a long shot.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.752
Sometimes those are
The odds that pay off.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.220
- Ready to go do this?
- Yeah.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.355
All I can say is these
Bad guys come up.

07:37.357 --> 07:42.226
To this deadly chandelier,
It's not a bright idea!

07:42.228 --> 07:44.229
Up top.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.732
Because the light bulbs are
Bright, and the idea is dumb.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.305
So first up, can fragile
Light bulb filaments.

07:54.307 --> 07:59.711
Survive m's method
Of extraction?

07:59.713 --> 08:01.379
Hey!

08:01.381 --> 08:02.847
It looks like one of those
Things hollywood got right.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.916
Yeah.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.251
Next...

08:06.253 --> 08:07.718
Two.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.588
Will those exposed filaments
Set off the gun powder.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.324
From a shotgun shell?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.394
In order for this myth
To be confirmed,

08:16.396 --> 08:17.862
The filament in that light bulb
Is going to need.

08:17.864 --> 08:21.266
To burn long enough
And hot enough.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.867
To transfer enough
Thermal energy.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.803
To that powder to ignite it.

08:24.805 --> 08:28.039
Now, that might be fairly rapid,
Or it might take some time.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.544
Let's play with some fire.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.145
The myth requires
A series of light bulb filaments.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.883
To fire simultaneously
As it would in a chandelier.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.754
So for a proof of concept,
Brian and jon set up four.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.490
Cue the explosive ingredient.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.691
Smells fresh.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.227
Careful.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.232
Okay, we're either going to
Learn how to make.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.167
A frag grenade chandelier.

08:56.169 --> 08:59.104
Or learn how to booby trap
Bad guy cereal.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.438
All right.
Let's get out of here.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.309
Multiple filaments in
Gun powder, like a chandelier,

09:04.311 --> 09:07.546
In three, two, one.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.782
Ooh, I felt that One in my face.

09:11.784 --> 09:15.587
That's great.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.988
That test went great.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.991
You can indeed ignite gun powder
With an exposed filament,

09:19.993 --> 09:21.726
But now it's time to look
At the other ingredient.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.194
In our test, The shotgun shell.

09:23.196 --> 09:26.731
Will it actually cause a pop big
Enough to shoot out shrapnel?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.543
For your eyes only,

09:39.545 --> 09:42.080
Brian and jon
Get their secret agent on.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.617
With a trio
Of booby trap tall tales.

09:45.619 --> 09:49.286
In the bond movie "Skyfall,"
M uses light bulb filaments.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.156
Inserted into shotgun shells.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.824
To turn a chandelier.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.428
Into a deadly
Fragmentation grenade.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.828
One!

09:57.830 --> 09:59.965
The guys know
The exposed filament.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.834
Will light up the gun powder.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.503
Ooh, I felt that one On my face.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.706
Now they want to know
If it'll work inside the shell.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.042
So there is the shot.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.177
There we go.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.914
For a proofofconcept test,
They've removed the shot,

10:15.916 --> 10:17.582
Leaving the powder and primer.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.050
Didn't even flinch.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.252
You know I wouldn't
Cut you, son.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.589
Next, they screw the shell
Into a light fitting.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.591
It's slightly absurd that there
Is a shotgun shell.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.994
Sticking out from
The underside of this light.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.864
Yes.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.534
In three, two, one!

10:40.406 --> 10:41.673
That was neat.
There was a little flash.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.609
It looked like the shell
Rocketed down.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.745
On the highspeed, it doesn't
Just look promising.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.348
For the myth, It's spectacular.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.418
You can see combustion in there
Before it takes off.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.488
You see the gun powder go,
"Fwoo, woo, woo, woo,

10:57.490 --> 10:59.157
Woo, woo, woo, woo."

10:59.159 --> 11:00.424
This is insanely beautiful.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.360
It's like looking At the sun.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.428
There's the swelling
Of the cartridge,

11:03.430 --> 11:06.297
So it's building up
Some pressure.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.100
Ooh!

11:09.102 --> 11:10.434
That was beautiful.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.370
That's great.

11:12.372 --> 11:16.241
The proof of concept looks good,
But to take this story further,

11:16.243 --> 11:17.976
It's time to hit the road.

11:17.978 --> 11:22.647
And scout out a sweet location
For an explosion.

11:22.649 --> 11:26.918
Well, perfect for
A chandelier booby trap.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.721
I love this abandoned
Sugar mill.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.256
It's got The perfect atmosphere,

11:31.258 --> 11:33.924
And considering it already looks
Like a bomb went off in here,

11:33.926 --> 11:38.462
I'm pretty sure we're getting
Our damage deposit back.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.598
In our smallscale test,
We're able to establish.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.733
That you could, in fact,
Ignite the powder.

11:42.735 --> 11:43.935
In a shotgun shell.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.402
With just a light bulb filament.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.538
All right. That's it.
That's good.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.208
But that was as far
As we could go in the shop.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.611
Now, we're going to add the
Shrapnel, set up our targets...

11:53.613 --> 11:54.946
Let me get you Some zip ties.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.281
I got them.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.149
- Are they in your mouth?
- I picked them up.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.617
Did they come off The floor?

11:59.619 --> 12:01.552
- Yeah.
- Isn't this a contaminated zone?

12:01.554 --> 12:04.889
Yeah.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.958
And see just How much carnage.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.626
These chandeliers can cause.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.763
- It's nice in here.
- Yeah.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.766
With the unwilling
Volunteer targets in place...

12:14.768 --> 12:16.367
This guy is drunk.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.837
- Yeah. He's had a few too many.
- He cannot stand up.

12:19.839 --> 12:25.243
Next, they assemble
The fragmentation.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.579
Bundles for each bulb.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.247
In the movie, m takes
A precut shotgun shell.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.783
And a freshly
Smashed light bulb,

12:31.785 --> 12:34.385
And she simply
Twists them together.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.387
First, I put the glue
On the rim.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.056
But, obviously,
In real life, it doesn't.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.058
So we have to assume she used
Some kind of adhesive.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.526
To keep these two together...

12:42.528 --> 12:44.395
Like a surgeon.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.765
In our case, hot glue.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.470
- Voilà!
- Nice.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.139
All right.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.140
In order for this myth
To be confirmed,

12:56.142 --> 12:57.742
When we flip that light switch,

12:57.744 --> 12:59.344
We need to heat up
The light bulb filaments,

12:59.346 --> 13:02.013
Igniting the gun powder
Inside a shotgun shell.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.281
Which causes them explode,
But enough energy.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.418
To send that shrapnel
Into those assassins.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.888
Deep enough that we see
Some real damage.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.622
In real life, however,
I don't know.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.090
If these uncontained
Shotgun shells.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.092
Will have enough force
To send this shrapnel.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.962
Through our assassins.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.498
In the world
Of "Do not try this at home,".

13:20.500 --> 13:23.835
This is about as extreme
As it will get.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.437
The experiment is designed
To produce shrapnel,

13:26.439 --> 13:28.840
And, because of that,
We can't be inside the building.

13:28.842 --> 13:32.043
In fact, we've had to place
Two rooms' worth of walls,

13:32.045 --> 13:35.512
A plywood barrier, as well as
The blast shield between us.

13:35.514 --> 13:39.918
And the chandeliers
Just to keep us safe.

13:39.920 --> 13:45.056
Okay. Chandelier booby trap test
In three, two, one!

13:54.801 --> 13:57.869
That was hilarious and adorable
Because it went off,

13:57.871 --> 14:00.805
It looked like
One sort of popped,

14:00.807 --> 14:03.274
And the other ones just heated
Up and melted through the bag,

14:03.276 --> 14:06.744
And the shrapnel just went ""
And rained on the floor.

14:11.284 --> 14:15.153
The filaments lit up, igniting
The gun powder in the shells,

14:15.155 --> 14:18.823
But there's not nearly
Enough explosive force.

14:18.825 --> 14:22.893
After the plastic melted,
It simply fell to the floor.

14:22.895 --> 14:26.230
This myth is
Not looking so great.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.765
If these chandeliers
Went off in your face,

14:27.767 --> 14:30.969
I'd say you be much
More annoyed than dead,

14:30.971 --> 14:33.905
But the next step is for us
To mimic that destruction.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.374
They got in the movie
But in real life.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.611
You would think it'd be
Easy to turn a shotgun shell.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.913
Into an explosive,

14:41.915 --> 14:43.447
But, obviously, it didn't work.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.249
So I'm going to tell you
Exactly how to get.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.851
The hollywood effect
In real life.

14:47.853 --> 14:53.391
First A whole bunch of.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.658
Second, you're going
To need to take.

14:54.660 --> 14:58.195
Mix it with.

14:58.197 --> 15:01.933
Third And don't forget this one.

15:06.139 --> 15:10.074
And that is exactly how we're
Going to take hollywood effects.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.344
And turn it
Into reallife carnage.

15:16.949 --> 15:19.017
All right. Range is hot!

15:19.019 --> 15:21.285
Okay!

15:21.287 --> 15:22.687
Hoo.

15:22.689 --> 15:26.423
Shotgun chandelier booby trap,
What it would it take?

15:26.425 --> 15:29.494
In three, two, one!

15:31.164 --> 15:32.997
Hoowee!

15:35.435 --> 15:38.168
Yeah, that was definitely
Equivalent to the hollywood,

15:38.170 --> 15:42.172
Like, "Bam, cha!"
Stuff raining down.

15:42.174 --> 15:46.544
A little bit of pyrotechnic
Knowhow goes a long way.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.450
The same quantity
Of gun powder was used,

15:52.452 --> 15:55.586
But it went from
A disappointing fizzle.

15:55.588 --> 15:59.724
To a spectacular
And deadly explosion.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.626
That's a head shot.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.061
That is hilarious.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.130
A lot of head shots,
It looks like.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.333
- Boom.
- Butt shot.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.001
Guess what This guy's name is.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.335
What's that?

16:11.337 --> 16:14.471
Michael bolton.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.074
While the basic concept
Of using a lightbulb filament.

16:17.076 --> 16:21.479
To fire a shotgun shell
Is sound,

16:21.481 --> 16:23.881
Unless the explosion
Is contained,

16:23.883 --> 16:27.518
There's not nearly enough force
For a fragmentation grenade.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.423
Well, at least one part
Of this myth was easy...

16:32.425 --> 16:34.558
Getting that gun powder
To ignite with a light bulb.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.893
That worked.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.428
Yeah, but if you just take
A smashed light bulb,

16:37.430 --> 16:39.897
Put the filament into a shotgun
Shell with gun powder.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.965
And wrap it in a bunch
Of random nuts and bolts.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.435
Does not yield the same results
As it did in the movie.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.303
I'm going to
Call this one busted.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.773
Definitely busted.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.912
Coming up...

16:54.914 --> 16:56.647
Wait.
What would this gun fire anyway?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.315
Buster meets his maker,

16:58.317 --> 17:01.686
Testing the myth
Of the shotgun floorboard.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.604
Next up, a third secret agent
Tall tale also from "Skyfall."

17:22.008 --> 17:24.075
While m is busy
Lighting up the enemy.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.144
With her shotgun chandelier,

17:26.146 --> 17:30.214
Bond puts in the groundwork for
Another makeshift booby trap.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.951
Beneath the floorboards,
He places two shotgun shells,

17:33.953 --> 17:39.756
Put the boards back on top and,
When triggered by a footfall,

17:39.758 --> 17:44.762
The bad guy goes down with
A bad case of missing leg.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.365
This is A pretty cool technique,

17:47.367 --> 17:49.633
But modern ammunition
Is incredibly safe.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.169
And incredibly Stable to handle.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.370
Exactly.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.571
This is like trying
To fire a shotgun shell.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.106
Out of a gun Without the gun.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.442
Yeah, But this james bond, man.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.445
Doing the impossible
Is what he does.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.780
Yeah, but in this
Nonsupercoolguy world.

18:02.782 --> 18:07.518
We live in, is it impossible
Or impossibleimpossible?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.520
So brian begins Building a floor.

18:09.522 --> 18:13.591
With movieaccurate
Hardwood boards.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.461
This test will determine
If the force of a footstep.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.928
On a hinged board.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.799
Is enough to fire off
The shotgun shell primer.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.536
Never would suspect a thing.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.338
Some pretty sturdy
Dance floor you've got.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.675
Welcome to hardwood
Beautiful floor here.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.409
This is where all the action
Is going to take place.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.078
For the testing,
And how's that going to work?

18:34.080 --> 18:37.081
Well, our shotgun mortar
Is going to be right here.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.749
This board is going
To be on a hinge.

18:38.751 --> 18:42.553
With that shotgun shell
Just ever so sticking up.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.555
All right. The floor is loaded.

18:44.557 --> 18:49.826
When in creeps our person,
Click, boom.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.763
In the movie, bond
Lines up the primer with a nail.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.967
To act like a firing pin.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.769
So that's how the guys set up.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.103
Wait. Okay.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.173
You removed everything
Except for the primer, right?

19:02.175 --> 19:03.374
Probably.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.842
"Probably" is good
Enough for me.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.244
Here we go!

19:06.246 --> 19:07.645
All right.
No, you're set. It's safe.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.913
Okay.

19:08.915 --> 19:12.984
Got my gun,
Check if it's loaded,

19:12.986 --> 19:14.051
Walk in the house.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.386
- You ready?
- Ready.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.921
Here we go.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.133
That was a creak
But that was not a fire.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.803
Yeah, I should have went "".

19:32.805 --> 19:36.607
So a movieaccurate
Gentle, creeping footfall,

19:36.609 --> 19:39.009
The primer didn't fire.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.145
Maybe they need to take
A less stealthy approach.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.214
Here we go.

19:43.216 --> 19:46.817
Stompy bad guy On booby trap.

19:46.819 --> 19:51.088
In three, two, one.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.824
That fired!

19:53.826 --> 19:57.628
Ooh, that, it charred
All the wood inside the hole,

19:57.630 --> 20:01.966
And it went
Straight through the primer.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.837
Well, That worked beautifully.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.106
Except that I had stomp on this.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.041
So we have to figure out the way
They did it in the movie.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.643
Where you can
Kind of tread on it,

20:12.645 --> 20:16.780
Walk on it and have
The primer still go off.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.116
We got the primer to go off
Inside the floorboard,

20:19.118 --> 20:20.717
But I had to stomp on it.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.786
In the movie, the bad guys
Just tread gently over it.

20:22.788 --> 20:23.988
And, "Boom!"

20:23.990 --> 20:25.456
It blows their legs off.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.657
I won't look.
You can surprise me.

20:26.659 --> 20:27.925
So we had to figure out way
To get primed.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.794
With a very gentle push,

20:30.796 --> 20:34.365
And I think I have an idea.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.333
This is a center punch,
And people use it.

20:36.335 --> 20:39.537
To mark things on steel,

20:39.539 --> 20:41.338
And as you slowly depress on it,

20:41.340 --> 20:43.807
A spring licks back and delivers.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.143
That impact
Almost instantaneously.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.946
Super stealthy bad guy
With center punch in the ground.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.815
We're going to install this
Inside our floorboards.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.551
And see if the shotgun
Primer goes off.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.087
Here we go.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.026
That's legit!

21:02.028 --> 21:04.161
- There goes your foot!
- Is that legit?

21:04.163 --> 21:06.497
It fired.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.701
So if bond had
Inverted the shell,

21:10.703 --> 21:13.838
Placed the primer over
A springloaded center punch,

21:13.840 --> 21:17.108
The stealthiest of footfalls
Would have worked.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.646
My leg!

21:22.648 --> 21:24.448
That worked great.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.716
Now, it's just a question,

21:25.718 --> 21:28.185
If that has gunpowder
And actual lead in it.

21:28.187 --> 21:29.453
What's going to happen?

21:29.455 --> 21:30.654
Yeah.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.056
I think it's time
To go fullscale.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.858
Fullscale.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.337
Jon and brian
Are testing the james bond.

21:47.339 --> 21:50.541
Shotgun floorboard.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.610
They know that
With a simple hack,

21:52.612 --> 21:59.349
A bad guy's careful footfall
Will set off the primer,

21:59.351 --> 22:02.153
But has a shotgun shell
Got enough gun powder.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.021
To take someone out?

22:04.023 --> 22:07.491
To find out, jon is stepping up.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.626
Meat leg, right?

22:09.628 --> 22:11.362
Because we need
A human analog of a leg,

22:11.364 --> 22:14.031
And so I have an idea to build
A one from the ground up,

22:14.033 --> 22:15.099
You know, Like poplar bones,

22:15.101 --> 22:17.368
Which is a good
Human analog for bones.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.036
And then, wrap it up
In pork loin.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.172
And pork skin
To simulate muscle tissue.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.241
Just like a human leg,
We'll see the damage.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.977
Yeah, but we still need
A system to drive the leg.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.046
So it actually stomps,

22:29.048 --> 22:31.582
And I think it's going to be
Something like this.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.317
Where we have buster,

22:33.319 --> 22:34.851
Replace one of his legs
With our meat leg.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.321
And then, have some
Kind of air piston system.

22:37.323 --> 22:40.056
That let's us
Drive his leg down.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.859
Sounds good.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.860
All right, buster.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.096
I'm going to make you
A real boy.

22:48.801 --> 22:52.937
Whoa. You might want to get that
Checked out somewhere else.

22:52.939 --> 22:57.074
Okay, so we're going to
Divide and conquer.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.576
Jon is going to go build
Buster's meat leg...

22:59.578 --> 23:03.147
All right. Let's put some meat
On these bones.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.150
While I build a pneumatic
System to animate it.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.418
So creepy.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.819
Shh.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.688
It's going to have a frame
To hold up buster,

23:11.690 --> 23:14.624
Variable stunt pressure
And a remote control.

23:14.626 --> 23:17.228
So that when you hit
That button, boom,

23:17.230 --> 23:19.429
Right into the shotgun shell.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.432
Almost lost a piece of calf.

23:21.434 --> 23:24.435
Skin, check.

23:24.437 --> 23:28.172
Meat, check.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.907
Snack, check.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.242
Okay.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.779
So my job here today is
To build a human leg analog.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.447
Out of raw pork.

23:37.449 --> 23:38.649
That's weird, right?

23:38.651 --> 23:41.785
Yeah, it's weird,
But it's also perfect.

23:41.787 --> 23:44.654
Because this actual meat
And this actual skin.

23:44.656 --> 23:46.056
Will give us
A really good illustration.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.258
Of what kind of damage
These shotgun shells would do.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.327
Yes.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.002
Pretty sure sewing up a person
Is just like sewing up.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.671
A backpack.

24:00.673 --> 24:05.209
As long as it stays closed,
It should be fine.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.677
Will you put chicharrones
In my mouth.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.279
Because I got gloves on?

24:13.485 --> 24:16.253
Part one, done.

24:18.357 --> 24:22.626
Now, I'm going to graft
The new skin onto the new leg.

24:22.628 --> 24:25.228
I don't know why everyone spends
So much money on med school.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.429
I basically got the hang
Of this, and it only.

24:26.431 --> 24:30.567
Costs me about 65 bucks.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.771
I have been infected
By swine flu.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.308
The back of the needle
Poked through my glove.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.910
That's how you spread
Zombie virus.

24:39.912 --> 24:43.113
You get cut,
And you don't tell anyone.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.851
This is our human analog.

24:47.853 --> 24:52.122
It's made from pork, pork skin,
And is very well stitched.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.324
Together in the back,
Holding it all together,

24:54.326 --> 24:56.927
Giving us the perfect
Human calf.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.529
I still have to do the thigh,
But when that's done,

24:59.531 --> 25:01.799
I'll also add some feet here.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.668
We'll have five thinner dowels
Wrapped in meat,

25:04.670 --> 25:05.936
Sewn to a sandal.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.138
Then, this end will attach
To brian's rig.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.640
And help us stomp
On the shotgun shell,

25:10.642 --> 25:12.676
And we'll see
If it blows the leg off.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.744
Before they head out on location.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.947
To fire up the meat leg...

25:16.949 --> 25:19.817
Wait.
What would this gun fire anyway?

25:19.819 --> 25:21.418
Bacon?

25:21.420 --> 25:23.487
Jon and brian Reset their sites.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.656
On a "Bourne legacy" nail gun.

25:28.226 --> 25:30.494
Can you really use
A fire extinguisher.

25:30.496 --> 25:33.363
To shoot a nail deep enough
Into a bad guy's shoulder...

25:34.500 --> 25:37.033
To distract him?

25:37.035 --> 25:40.637
To find out, they've selected
Their co2 extinguisher...

25:40.639 --> 25:41.972
boop.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.643
Modified it as per the
Movie, constructed a stand...

25:45.645 --> 25:47.378
Like a glove.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.647
- And brought in a bad guy...
- let's shoot him.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.049
With a fleshy target To aim it.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.419
I love when we break out
The ballistics gel.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.991
I'll aim it
Right for this guy's shoulder.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.393
What do you think?

26:02.395 --> 26:03.594
Ooh, That looks pretty good.

26:03.596 --> 26:07.397
I've never aimed
A fire extinguisher before.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.400
Yeah. I say we would load it up.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.134
This is pretty close
To the movie setup.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.137
We got the fire extinguisher.
We got our bad guy.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.205
He's got Meaty shoulders.

26:15.207 --> 26:19.142
All that's left to do now
Is to fire one at him.

26:19.144 --> 26:21.412
The hero in our movie
Hits the fire extinguisher.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.947
Handle with a pipe.

26:22.949 --> 26:26.816
Dee, pah!

26:26.818 --> 26:28.953
Secret agent material.

26:28.955 --> 26:34.725
Duplex nail in co2 extinguisher
In three, two, one!

26:38.431 --> 26:40.163
It's somewhere up.

26:40.165 --> 26:43.100
Look at the tube.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.903
Jon hit the handle, Boom, tee.

26:46.905 --> 26:50.107
It hit, except there wasn't
Any hits on the target.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.243
The hit was over
The shoulder on the wall.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.645
Here it comes.

26:54.647 --> 26:55.712
Psh.

26:55.714 --> 26:57.181
Yeah. You see that?

26:57.183 --> 26:58.863
The barrel is moving
Before the nail exits.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.453
This goes about there.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.590
The solution... a zip tie
To prevent barrel kickback.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.459
And cue take two.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.928
Duplex nail and fire
Extinguisher with the barrel.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.465
Lockdown In three, two, one.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.603
Think I heard
That one behind me.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.271
You did, jon.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.140
It bounced Off the gel.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.875
I saw it with my naked eye.

27:24.877 --> 27:29.079
Wow.

27:29.081 --> 27:32.616
Yeah, so it fired,
Tumbled, butt end first,

27:32.618 --> 27:34.685
Went in, like, what,
Inch, inch and a half?

27:34.687 --> 27:35.685
At least.

27:35.687 --> 27:38.155
And then, slingshotted Back out.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.823
But I think if that hits
The tip first,

27:39.825 --> 27:41.157
It's going to have
Different results,

27:41.159 --> 27:42.893
So we need to fire A few more.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.095
For the next hour...

27:45.097 --> 27:46.896
- low. Way low.
- Way low?

27:46.898 --> 27:48.765
Shot...

27:48.767 --> 27:50.100
That was Way to the right.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.569
After shot...

27:52.571 --> 27:54.504
- way right.
- After shot...

27:54.506 --> 27:57.641
Down and to the left.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.175
Serves up a miss...

27:59.177 --> 28:02.179
I'm not sure where that hit,
But it bounced around a lot.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.581
Or...

28:04.583 --> 28:06.583
We're getting direct hits,
But they're bouncing off.

28:06.585 --> 28:07.785
Yeah.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.653
And as evidenced
On the highspeed...

28:09.655 --> 28:13.524
Yeah. That's spinning.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.591
Okay.

28:14.593 --> 28:15.926
It boils down to a lack.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.462
Of inflight
Ballistic stability...

28:18.464 --> 28:21.765
Ooh, that tumbles real hard.
It's a crapshoot.

28:21.767 --> 28:25.669
And the nail gun myth
Might be done and busted.

28:25.671 --> 28:28.872
Three, two, one!

28:33.278 --> 28:34.411
Look at that.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.214
That's Super impressive.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.154
That is a tipfirst hit,
And it hits so hard.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.891
That it actually
Swung like that.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.695
It may have taken a while,
But that is 2 inches deep.

28:51.697 --> 28:55.765
And is surely going to
Distract the bad guy,

28:55.767 --> 28:58.835
And several shots later,

28:58.837 --> 29:01.304
With the ballistics gel
Reorientated,

29:01.306 --> 29:03.373
They get a repeat result.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.375
Tada!

29:05.377 --> 29:07.644
Look at that.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.045
That would slow me down,

29:09.047 --> 29:11.181
And I think that would
Just about slow down anyone.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.650
But he is still naked.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.719
Yeah. You thinking?

29:15.721 --> 29:16.854
Yeah, Let's suit him up.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.857
All right.
Let's put some clothes on... It.

29:19.859 --> 29:23.927
With the bad guy
Now suitably suited...

29:23.929 --> 29:25.261
All right.

29:25.263 --> 29:28.065
Nice, tailored
Super secret spy jacket.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.733
The barrage continues.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.801
Three, two, one!

29:31.803 --> 29:33.269
Off on the left again.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.871
One! Ooh.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.472
That bounced off it.

29:36.474 --> 29:41.211
Once again, the ballistic
Instability of the projectile.

29:41.213 --> 29:46.683
Puts the voracity of the movie's
Oneshot hit in doubt.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.485
One.

29:48.487 --> 29:52.022
And although they eventually
Get one to stick.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.424
It's far from convincing.

29:54.426 --> 29:55.492
How far is it in there?

29:55.494 --> 29:56.893
It's about an inch in.

29:56.895 --> 29:59.296
An inch. So these are working.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.630
They're going through
The material,

30:00.632 --> 30:02.299
But they don't have
All that much strength.

30:02.301 --> 30:05.969
And, I mean, how many did we
Fire to get this one, like, 40?

30:08.240 --> 30:10.440
- Many of them.
- Yeah.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.976
We finally got the nail
To punch through the suit.

30:12.978 --> 30:17.113
And into our ballistics gel,
But this isn't that impressive.

30:17.115 --> 30:19.382
The problem is power
And the nail's stability.

30:19.384 --> 30:20.784
While it's flying
Through the air.

30:20.786 --> 30:23.320
Part of the ingenuity
Of this super secret spy trick.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.255
Was in the simplicity.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.990
He needed something
Quick and dirty.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.992
That he could throw
Together as a trap.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.594
Well, it didn't quite work
Out like in the movies.

30:31.596 --> 30:32.930
So we're going to have
To see what it takes.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.399
To make this myth a reality.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.345
One!

30:48.347 --> 30:53.016
With the fire extinguisher nail
Gun lacking accuracy and power,

30:53.018 --> 30:54.417
The myth is cooked.

30:54.419 --> 30:57.421
How many did we fire
To get this one, like, 40?

30:57.423 --> 30:59.489
But brian and jon
Aren't finished yet.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.291
Chyah! Sorry.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.960
They want to know
What it would take.

31:02.962 --> 31:07.431
To make this fictional spy
Gadget a frightening fact.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.165
A barrel extension
Is a simple way.

31:09.167 --> 31:10.567
To capture the potential energy.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.903
Of that compressed co2
That we're missing.

31:12.905 --> 31:16.173
As the nails comes out of this
Relatively short 3inch barrel,

31:16.175 --> 31:17.708
The gas is still expanding,

31:17.710 --> 31:20.243
And all that does
Is destabilize the nail.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.712
By putting that longer
Barrel on there,

31:21.714 --> 31:23.247
We're going to
Stabilize the nail.

31:23.249 --> 31:27.851
And accelerate it
To terrifying speeds.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.519
While brian does the.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.522
"Definitely do not try this
At home" reengineering.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.691
Of the fire extinguisher
Fittings...

31:36.861 --> 31:40.597
That should Do the job.

31:40.599 --> 31:44.467
Jon preps
The ballistics gel torso...

31:44.469 --> 31:45.802
Looks great.

31:45.804 --> 31:48.271
For target practice.

31:48.273 --> 31:51.407
Yep. Right up main street.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.810
Don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.417
There you go.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.489
Ooh, yeah.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.824
What.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.660
Let's put the head on.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.431
It's perfect.

32:14.433 --> 32:19.303
Next, our bad guy is dressed
For highspeed camera access.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.704
Not bad.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.506
The suit fits, but we need
To tailor it a bit.

32:23.508 --> 32:27.177
To really match your body type,
So I think I'm going to...

32:27.179 --> 32:30.380
Classic look, sideless suit,

32:30.382 --> 32:34.851
Really show off those lats.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.254
Perfect.

32:37.256 --> 32:38.722
So this is it.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.656
The movie may have
Gotten it wrong,

32:40.658 --> 32:43.527
But will brian and john's
Quick fix get it right?

32:43.529 --> 32:48.432
Extended barrel at bad buy
Buster in three, two, one!

32:56.208 --> 32:59.342
Did that Go all the way in?

32:59.344 --> 33:01.011
It might have gone
All the way through him.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.413
I'm not even sure.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.415
Yep. That worked.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.618
The extended barrel
Acted like a rifle,

33:08.620 --> 33:12.688
Improving accuracy and power.

33:12.690 --> 33:18.762
You can see the travel
All the way through to here,

33:18.764 --> 33:19.896
Right there.

33:19.898 --> 33:21.498
Wow, the exit wound
Is not very big either.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.166
Look how small that is.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.768
Ever since I first
I saw this movie,

33:24.770 --> 33:26.636
I've always wanted
To shoot a nail.

33:26.638 --> 33:30.573
From a fire extinguisher
Into a bad guy.

33:30.575 --> 33:34.043
I can check it off
Of my insane bucket list.

33:34.045 --> 33:36.913
It's sideways, flat,
Embedded in the foam.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.849
In our first test
With no barrel extension,

33:38.851 --> 33:41.718
We managed to shoot a nail
An inch into our ballistics gel.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.519
Through a suit And a dress shirt.

33:43.521 --> 33:46.056
But just adding
6 feet worth of pipe,

33:46.058 --> 33:48.525
Managed to shoot
The nail all the way through.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.994
A ballistics gel bad guy.

33:50.996 --> 33:53.663
I would say we definitely
Unleashed the full potential.

33:53.665 --> 33:56.133
Of our co2 extinguisher.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.469
- That was awesome.
- Yeah.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.271
It did go Straight through him,

34:01.273 --> 34:03.540
But that was
A 6foot barrel extension.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.275
We never saw that
With the smallscale,

34:05.277 --> 34:06.943
Moviestyle Fire extinguishers.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.678
On top of that,
It took at least 30 nails.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.146
To get one To stick straight in.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.549
Yeah. I think this is busted.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.217
Busted.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.170
Yeah, let's go.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.237
We're testing the myth from
The james bond movie "Skyfall".

34:35.239 --> 34:36.973
That you can make
An effective booby trap.

34:36.975 --> 34:39.775
By hiding shotgun shells
Under a floorboard.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.112
We're about to go fullscale
With live ammunition to see.

34:42.114 --> 34:46.183
If we can take out
Our evil assassin.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.650
Back at the abandoned
Sugar mill...

34:48.652 --> 34:49.585
Nice.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.654
Brian and jon Are gearing up.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.123
For the floorboard
Shotgun showdown.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.725
It'll go "Bam,"
Fire into the floorboard.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.194
All right.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.996
Which way are we
Having him face, forward?

34:59.998 --> 35:01.198
There you go.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.800
- Yeah. How's he looking?
- Good.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.536
Except this just became
A western.

35:06.538 --> 35:10.207
With bad guy buster in place...

35:10.209 --> 35:14.077
I got special Meat delivery.

35:14.079 --> 35:15.812
Voilà.

35:15.814 --> 35:19.549
It's time for some field
Surgery... a leg reattachment.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.617
How is it?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.884
- Looks good.
- It's good?

35:21.886 --> 35:24.020
This goes...

35:24.022 --> 35:25.621
All right.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.290
Fantastic.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.358
There we go.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.894
Here's the fun part. All right.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.763
I got the leg bolt
Right in here.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.631
Okay.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.033
Ooh.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.702
We just targeted Our meat leg.

35:38.704 --> 35:42.838
- We did.
- That's a strange sensation.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.040
Yeah.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.243
He's got a webbed
Toe condition thing.

35:46.245 --> 35:49.712
That doesn't look right.
You should see a doctor.

35:49.714 --> 35:52.315
This is A vacation flipflop.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.117
It's foam, doesn't offer
Much protection,

35:54.119 --> 36:00.790
But in the newest line
Of assassin footwear, tada,

36:00.792 --> 36:04.394
It is a tactical Boot sole.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.863
With the vacation feel
Of a flipflop.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.764
You ready?
For your easy viewing pleasure?

36:08.766 --> 36:10.000
That's right.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.001
It has the sole
Of a regular boot,

36:12.003 --> 36:17.673
But it will allow the cameras to
See what happens in gory detail.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.142
Ooh, it's starting to go.
All right.

36:19.144 --> 36:20.410
Okay. You ready?

36:20.412 --> 36:21.745
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's do the...

36:21.747 --> 36:23.547
- It's getting juicy.
- Here we go.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.881
It's getting juicy. All right.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.882
Let's clear the floor
And give this guy a test stomp.

36:26.884 --> 36:28.884
Brian's piston
Is calibrated to give.

36:28.886 --> 36:33.022
Buster the stepping force
Of averagesized bad guy.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.624
Deadly assassin With meat leg.

36:34.626 --> 36:38.395
Regular walking tread test
In three, two, one!

36:40.232 --> 36:41.998
That was A pretty good step.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.967
Yeah. I think that's perfect.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.837
Let's add some
Shotgun shells to it.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.506
- Yeah, let's do that.
- All right.

37:05.189 --> 37:10.326
If you smell something funky,
It's probably this.

37:10.328 --> 37:12.395
Don't get More fresh than that.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.663
Yeah.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.265
Here's what we're
Going to need to see.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.932
To call this myth confirmed.

37:16.934 --> 37:19.269
All right, I'm going to load
The shotgun shells.

37:19.271 --> 37:22.271
The meat leg is going to need
To push on the trick floorboard,

37:22.273 --> 37:26.609
In turn, firing the shotgun
Shells up through the floorboard.

37:26.611 --> 37:29.346
With enough force
To cause enough damage.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.082
To permanently put our assassin
Out of commission.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.683
Okay.

37:33.685 --> 37:37.287
Jon, like bond,
Has placed two shotgun shells.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.954
Under the hinged floorboard.

37:38.956 --> 37:40.557
Range is hot!

37:40.559 --> 37:43.559
But what does he think
Is going to happen?

37:43.561 --> 37:45.361
Our assassin buster
Is all set up.

37:45.363 --> 37:46.429
What I think is going to happen,

37:46.431 --> 37:47.697
Is he'll stomp
On the floorboard,

37:47.699 --> 37:49.098
But, even though
The shotgun shells.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.366
Definitely have enough power,

37:50.368 --> 37:53.837
But it's not contained
By a gun or a barrel,

37:53.839 --> 37:56.906
So if it doesn't work,
That's going to be why.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.910
All right. It's pressurized.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.313
Okay. Here we go.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.980
You excited?

38:04.982 --> 38:08.251
Yeah, I'm actually
A little nervous, too.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.920
Fullscale shotgun
Under the floorboard.

38:10.922 --> 38:14.991
Booby trap "Skyfall" myth
In three, two, one!

38:17.729 --> 38:19.329
Buster stepped up.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.664
Both shotgun shells fired.

38:21.666 --> 38:24.401
But...

38:24.403 --> 38:29.673
I don't see any holes
In the floorboard.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.542
They're going to need
A closer inspection...

38:32.544 --> 38:34.477
Not much carnage there.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.213
Yep, the leg appears
To be intact.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.082
And here's why.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.086
Look at that. That's awesome.
They both fired.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.154
This board,
Heck of a lot stronger.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.423
Than a little bit
Of shotgun shell.

38:47.425 --> 38:48.892
Clearly not A great booby trap.

38:48.894 --> 38:49.959
Yeah, definitely not.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.695
Looks like This guy lucked out.

38:51.697 --> 38:55.065
I'm not sure Why I touched that.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.437
The foot goes down.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.905
The shotgun shells fire up
Into the floorboard,

39:02.907 --> 39:04.974
And that's about
Where things stop.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.910
At that point,
That wood is too solid.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.511
For those shotgun shells
To get through.

39:08.513 --> 39:13.516
Instead, they blow out the side,
And nothing goes anywhere.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.386
But they can't
Leave it it there.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.788
Hohoho, so nice.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.458
Ready to do this right?
Real shotgun.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.992
Beautiful, guys, Going well.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.795
Cue the patented
"Mythbusters" finale.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.598
What would it take
To recreate the result?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.867
So we'll need to bring
The floor up to about 6 feet.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.335
To get the shotgun under it.

39:32.337 --> 39:34.203
No one stand on it.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.739
We're going to add
One more thing.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.873
This oak, way too hard.

39:37.875 --> 39:41.544
We're going to swap it out
For much softer pine.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.679
With the hardwood
Boards replaced,

39:43.681 --> 39:45.281
They raise the floor.

39:45.283 --> 39:48.084
Careful now. He still has a gun.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.952
- And buster...
- so graceful.

39:49.954 --> 39:52.355
Look at you, like a swan.

39:52.357 --> 39:55.291
Gets a brandnew leg
For the occasion.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.759
Pass me leg.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.628
The leg.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.764
There we go. There we go.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.700
I just dropped it.

40:03.702 --> 40:04.700
I dropped the nut.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.836
I got it.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.571
Nut please.

40:08.573 --> 40:11.975
Ooh, it's real close
To my mouth.

40:11.977 --> 40:14.177
So what are we doing to
Give you that hollywood,

40:14.179 --> 40:16.913
Shotgununderthefloorboard
Finale?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.047
All right. We're good here.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.049
Well, for starters,
We put the shotgun shells.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.051
Into an actual shotgun
Which would give us.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.053
The power
They're meant to deliver.

40:24.055 --> 40:27.857
Wow.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.059
Thing is starting to
Remind me of the body farm.

40:30.061 --> 40:33.662
Secondly, we replaced that
Really tough red oak with pine,

40:33.664 --> 40:35.130
Which is a lot weaker.

40:35.132 --> 40:37.333
This should definitely give us
That massive "Boom" explosion.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.202
And, hopefully,
Blow this guy's leg off.

40:39.204 --> 40:42.505
Last thing... shotgun shell.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.443
Set to fire.

40:48.346 --> 40:50.346
You do realize now,
We have a real shotgun.

40:50.348 --> 40:52.415
Pointed at A pretty real foot.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.216
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

40:54.218 --> 40:56.619
All right.
Well, in that case, let's do it.

40:56.621 --> 41:00.290
"Skyfall" shotgun under
The floorboards booby trap,

41:00.292 --> 41:02.425
What would it take
With real shotgun.

41:02.427 --> 41:06.495
In three, two, one.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.764
Ooh!

41:08.766 --> 41:12.168
I think meat is still raining
Down from the ceiling.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.771
I'm pretty sure I see part
Of his bones sticking out.

41:14.773 --> 41:17.640
Boy.

41:20.912 --> 41:24.747
That was gruesome
But also beautiful.

41:27.853 --> 41:31.387
In this hollywood version,
I would say "Man down."

41:33.525 --> 41:35.458
- That was it?
- Hoho.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.861
That is so gruesome.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.395
It blew his foot off.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.664
I'm pretty sure
This is a foot bone,

41:41.666 --> 41:46.202
That it impaled or just tore out
And stuck to the calf.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.074
It's pretty clear that
To harness the destructive.

41:51.076 --> 41:54.009
Potential of a shotgun shell,

41:54.011 --> 41:58.548
The containment of a gun barrel
Is an essential requirement.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.083
Well, if this myth was,

42:00.085 --> 42:02.084
"Can you shoot a shotgun shell
Through a floorboard.

42:02.086 --> 42:04.687
And break a leg to pieces?,"
It'd be true but...

42:04.689 --> 42:06.756
This is just about putting
A shotgun shell.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.557
Without the gun
Into a floorboard.

42:08.559 --> 42:10.359
And expect it to blow off
Someone's leg,

42:10.361 --> 42:12.362
Which we saw it did not.

42:12.364 --> 42:13.696
I would call this one...

42:13.698 --> 42:14.897
- busted.
- Yeah, man.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.499
Totally busted.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.301
Kind of like his foot.
