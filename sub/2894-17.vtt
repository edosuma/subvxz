WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:03.402
Tony:
An aerial combat assist

00:03.404 --> 00:06.238
Will raise your game
to a whole new level, cap.

00:06.373 --> 00:09.141
You get it?
'cause it's up high?

00:09.143 --> 00:11.176
Raised?
(mechanical whirring)

00:13.013 --> 00:15.114
I like my boots on
the ground, thank you.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.716
I don't want to rely on tech,
and I don't need armor.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.386
You're right. What you need
is a way to keep up with me

00:20.388 --> 00:23.055
In case there's not
a sky-cycle around.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.391
Hence, I took your
boring old butt-kickers

00:25.393 --> 00:26.725
And I teched them up a bit.

00:26.727 --> 00:30.129
"more tech" does not
always equal "more better."

00:30.263 --> 00:32.231
I don't think
that's proper grammar.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.366
I'm dumbing it down
for the genius.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.402
And we're ready.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.571
Look. Think of it
like skiing. On air.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.042
Last time I skied, it was
backwards down a mountain

00:43.044 --> 00:45.210
Firing a machine gun
at hydra agents.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.479
This will be
"more better," then.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.182
And hot chocolate for you
if you don't break anything.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.250
(beeps)

00:51.518 --> 00:54.219
(thrusters revving)
whoa.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.790
Hey! This, uh...
Not bad, tony!

00:57.792 --> 00:59.091
Whoa!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.225
(grunts)

01:01.061 --> 01:03.162
Hey! Time out!

01:03.363 --> 01:04.830
Stark, a little help here?

01:04.831 --> 01:07.466
Uh, shouldn't you,
like, shut it down?

01:07.600 --> 01:09.468
(chuckles)
in a second.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.438
This, my friend, is what
technology was made for.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.507
(loud grunting)
(clanging)

01:17.444 --> 01:18.744
(grunts)

01:19.245 --> 01:20.479
Huh?

01:21.848 --> 01:23.315
(both grunt)

01:25.385 --> 01:27.820
Yeah, and sometimes,
it just kicks you in the butt.

01:28.321 --> 01:31.523
(chuckles) five-thousand
hits and counting.
(grunting)

01:32.592 --> 01:34.126
Let me make a couple
adjustments for you.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.195
No, thanks.
Keep your jet boots.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.263
I'll stick with
my natural talents.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.466
I don't need technology
as a crutch.

01:40.768 --> 01:44.770
No offense. You think
I'm afraid of tech.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.505
I think you're afraid
to be without it.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.207
I mean, you need
the arc reactor

01:48.209 --> 01:50.509
To keep you alive,
but the rest of it?

01:50.511 --> 01:53.278
Tell me you could
go 24 hours without
all your toys.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.115
We're really doing this?
A bet?

01:56.117 --> 01:58.150
If I win, one week
of basic training.

01:58.384 --> 02:01.787
5:00 a.M. Wakeup,
10-mile runs,
push-ups, pull-ups...

02:01.789 --> 02:03.822
Won't happen,
but okay.

02:03.824 --> 02:08.160
And if I win,
you test-drive
my next invention.

02:08.329 --> 02:12.431
You are gonna make an
awesome crash test dummy.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.599
When do we start?

02:14.901 --> 02:16.869
Now.
(powering down)

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.384 --> 02:33.318
I can't seem to get
the base differential
to jive with

02:33.320 --> 02:37.823
Something's probably off
with the inverse
power coefficients.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.526
Don't forget
to carry the three!

02:40.528 --> 02:42.794
What?
I didn't make a bet.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.638
Ah.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.806
(chuckles)

02:56.276 --> 02:58.610
Uh, I want to check
the news.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.746
What if manhattan
is under attack?

03:02.849 --> 03:05.517
Ugh. People wrap fish
in this, you know.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.521
(dings)

03:09.822 --> 03:11.423
(clears throat)

03:11.425 --> 03:13.892
We're 110 floors up.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.627
Tony: Seriously?

03:17.697 --> 03:20.265
When will this day end?

03:20.267 --> 03:21.567
I'm done!

03:21.569 --> 03:23.569
It's only been
96 minutes, tony.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.604
You win! Give it.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.576
(grunting)

03:30.578 --> 03:32.244
Thirty million hits!

03:32.246 --> 03:35.514
I missed you most
of all, internet.
(smooches)

03:35.815 --> 03:38.984
Now do you see
how relying on tech
dulls your natural skills?

03:39.752 --> 03:41.520
I like the 21st century.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.889
But I'm not the
only one who relies
on tech around here.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.857
(chuckles)

03:47.393 --> 03:48.694
You know, you're right.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.829
We should all give up
tech for a few days.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.798
It could be
a team-building exercise.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.300
You know, that's
a great idea.

03:55.803 --> 03:59.371
I bet none of you
could last 24 hours

03:59.373 --> 04:01.006
In a totally
tech-free environment.

04:01.709 --> 04:06.712
First one who uses tech
has to do my laundry.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.879
Huh?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.948
Where's this tech-free
environment?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.883
I know just the place.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.686
Thor? Hulk?
You guys stay here

04:14.688 --> 04:17.022
In case the world needs
an avenger. Or two.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.625
And make me a promise.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.327
If we're gonna go
24 hours without tech,

04:22.562 --> 04:25.864
You'll go a day without
destroying my stuff.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.300
Do you think us
children, stark?

04:28.501 --> 04:31.403
Seriously, don't
touch anything.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.874
What are we gonna
touch first?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.479
Come on, tony,
where are we headed?

04:40.613 --> 04:41.947
You'll find out
soon enough.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.349
(impatient tapping)

04:47.387 --> 04:49.788
Falcon, relax!

04:49.790 --> 04:51.390
(tapping slows)

04:51.591 --> 04:52.858
Sorry.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.526
Stark's version
of "roughing it"

04:54.528 --> 04:57.729
Is poolside in cancun
with only one cabana girl.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.398
(yawns)

04:59.699 --> 05:01.967
(snores and moans)

05:02.302 --> 05:03.769
(banging)
whoa!

05:03.771 --> 05:06.004
That cabana girl does
not sound very happy.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.307
(screeching)

05:08.875 --> 05:10.976
Are those pterodactyls?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.944
Yes. Yes, they are.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.446
Hold on.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.924
A perfect emergency
crash landing.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.593
On manual, I might add.

05:28.595 --> 05:31.096
You took us camping
in the savage land?

05:31.098 --> 05:34.499
You said we should
get back to nature.

05:34.501 --> 05:38.003
There's nothing more
natural than a hidden,
prehistoric enclave.

05:38.371 --> 05:39.705
Perfect.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.974
Coolest camping trip
in history!

05:42.976 --> 05:44.943
Can we see more dinosaurs?
I doubt it.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.813
I picked a spot far away
from the big guys.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.881
I like a good bet,
but I'm not stupid.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.651
The 24 tech-free hours

05:52.653 --> 05:54.019
Start now.
(alarm chirps)

05:56.823 --> 05:58.590
Jarvis is programmed
to keep us

05:58.592 --> 06:00.992
Out of our comfort zone
for a whole day.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.929
Unless this is too
intense for you guys.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.531
Too intense?
This is fantastic!

06:06.533 --> 06:09.000
Let's head into the jungle
to make camp. I'll lead.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.771
Seriously, then?
There's no pool?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.573
We're surrounded
by crazy people.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.843
(rumbling)

06:19.979 --> 06:21.847
(growls) I'm hungry!

06:22.048 --> 06:24.015
What are you doing?

06:24.017 --> 06:25.650
Want popcorn!

06:25.652 --> 06:29.788
Friend hulk, we do not
need to rely on stark's toys.

06:31.591 --> 06:35.127
Energy you need.
Energy you shall have!

06:47.540 --> 06:51.042
Let's try... A watermelon.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.182
(bird calling)

07:00.820 --> 07:02.587
Tony: You can't just
put up walls and a roof.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.123
You need
adequate cross support,
or it all collapses.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.527
All you need is
a counterbalance,
like this rock.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.997
I'm talking engineering,
you've got a rock.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.032
Haven't had to do that
in a while.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.769
How's the shelter going?
I miss my lab.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.905
Tony, think of
this place as a lab.

07:19.907 --> 07:23.575
You're the experiment.
What're you going
to find inside?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.977
I hate it when you
pep talk and I'm not
in air conditioning.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.881
And I hate being hungry.
Who packed the marshmallows?

07:30.049 --> 07:32.884
Unless they grow on trees,
we don't have 'em.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.120
Dinner's on me, then.

07:36.055 --> 07:40.525
Behold, the super sling
3000... B.C.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.830
(loud croaking)

07:45.064 --> 07:48.233
But we might not wanna
eat anything I could shoot.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.635
Whoa! Yuck!

07:51.471 --> 07:53.038
Give me those back.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.974
Ugh. Hang on.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.643
(chewing)

08:01.547 --> 08:03.048
(sling shooting)

08:03.649 --> 08:06.084
Mom's cookies?
They're homemade.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.853
That counts as "natural".
Right?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.888
Yep.
Definitely.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.022
I can live with that.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.925
(distant roaring)

08:15.127 --> 08:20.065
Hulk? There's no way
he could smell these
all the way down here.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.069
(rumbling)

08:24.904 --> 08:28.907
Your mom's cooking brings
out the beast in everyone.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.910
(growling)
(rumbling)

08:33.179 --> 08:34.980
I take it back.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.847
I don't want to see
any more dinosaurs.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.049
Guys, I swear, there weren't
supposed to be any here.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.986
It said so on
the s.H.I.E.L.D. Maps.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.621
Who knew dinosaurs
could read maps?

08:43.990 --> 08:46.157
Take cover!
(grunting)

08:49.195 --> 08:50.629
(growling)

08:50.631 --> 08:52.130
I think I hate nature.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.835
No!

08:56.837 --> 08:58.870
Jarvis, release my armor.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.640
Jarvis:
The 24 hour no-tech rule
is still in effect, sir.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.910
Override code 4.
<i>You disabled the</i>
<i>override codes, sir.</i>

09:04.912 --> 09:06.978
(growling)

09:06.980 --> 09:09.548
Then override my override.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.083
Don't be mad at me, sir.
I'm just trying to prevent you

09:12.085 --> 09:14.252
From washing
the hulk's drawers.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.989
Let's take a scouting
position in those trees.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.961
(straining)

09:25.331 --> 09:26.598
(groans)

09:30.870 --> 09:32.971
Okay, so I'm not a climber.
Big whoop.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.141
It's not like we're ever
chasing evil squirrels
or anything.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.776
(growling)
(both gasp)

09:37.778 --> 09:40.245
T-rex! T-rex!

09:40.980 --> 09:44.049
(roaring)
and I left the
hulk at home.

09:46.819 --> 09:47.953
(fly buzzing)

09:47.955 --> 09:49.955
That's the last of it.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.657
The turkey was my favorite.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.927
Blew up real good. Mmm.
(chewing)

09:55.929 --> 09:57.796
But I'm still hungry.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.699
Jarvis:
<i>The only food that</i>
<i>has not been "barbecued"</i>

10:00.701 --> 10:03.768
<i>Is a container of mints</i>
<i>in mr. Stark's closet.</i>

10:05.338 --> 10:07.872
I claim those mints
in the name of asgard!

10:07.874 --> 10:10.575
(grunting)
fat chance, blondie!

10:14.013 --> 10:16.147
(dinosaurs roaring)

10:20.653 --> 10:22.621
(snarling)
(grunts)

10:24.123 --> 10:25.190
(grunting)

10:26.092 --> 10:27.158
(screams)

10:27.293 --> 10:28.660
(muttering)
saw this in a movie.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.829
You don't move,
they don't chomp.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.731
Never mind!

10:33.933 --> 10:35.634
(grunts)

10:38.371 --> 10:40.071
Okay, now I just
feel stupid.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.883
Tony: Good job.

10:53.686 --> 10:57.722
Seriously, I swung a stick,
in case you didn't notice.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.891
This isn't about what
you can't do, tony.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.393
It's about what you can.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.028
I can tell you this...

11:03.030 --> 11:05.030
Those animals
weren't after us.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.032
They were running
away from something.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.366
And that's bad.
(scoffs)

11:08.368 --> 11:10.735
Are you suggesting we go
into the freaky jungle

11:10.737 --> 11:13.104
And see what's nasty
enough to scare a t-rex,

11:13.106 --> 11:15.106
With just our wits
and our bare hands?

11:16.042 --> 11:16.975
All right. Cool.

11:16.977 --> 11:20.111
Tony: (whispering)
come on, jarvis,
do me a solid.

11:20.113 --> 11:24.049
What do you want?
More memory circuits?
A bigger hard drive?

11:24.051 --> 11:26.718
Jarvis:  <i>I am sorry, sir.</i>
<i>No, you're not.</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:28.386
<i>No. I'm not.</i>

11:30.056 --> 11:31.823
Falcon:
Who's drilling here?

11:34.193 --> 11:36.895
(high-pitched whining)
vibranium.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.997
They're mining vibranium.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.900
Isn't that, like,
the rarest metal on earth?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.768
Rare, indestructible,

11:43.770 --> 11:46.037
And very dangerous
in the wrong hands.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.873
The only known source
of vibranium is wakanda.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.709
Justin: (on speakers)
<i>was wakanda.</i>

11:51.911 --> 11:54.446
<i>In case you missed</i>
<i>the very obvious signs,</i>

11:54.448 --> 11:58.149
<i>Avengers, </i> (slurping)
<i>I was here first.</i>

11:58.284 --> 11:59.951
Justin hammer.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.886
Tech master
justin hammer?

12:02.121 --> 12:03.888
"master" is a bit strong.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.858
Tech hobbyist, maybe.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.194
Captain america:
<i>Don't underestimate him.</i>

12:09.196 --> 12:11.429
<i>He's one step away</i>
<i>from the cabal.</i>

12:11.431 --> 12:14.399
One very small step,
once I buy my way in

12:14.401 --> 12:17.235
With a pile of
freshly minted vibranium.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.973
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>Where are your</i>
<i>iron man pajamas?</i>

12:22.441 --> 12:27.846
No toys! Well, well,
this does make things
interesting, doesn't it?

12:28.114 --> 12:30.415
<i>Boys? We have guests!</i>

12:30.983 --> 12:32.450
(both growling and snarling)

12:35.121 --> 12:37.088
Those raptors are
carrying weapons, right?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.423
Yep.
Uh-huh.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.525
And that's my mind snapping.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.094
(roaring)

12:43.863 --> 12:46.030
Mints! Oh, yeah.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.003
These mints
taste like cuff links.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.138
(thumping)

12:53.140 --> 12:56.141
Thor: Fresh breath
shall be mine, hulk!

12:58.344 --> 12:59.410
(roaring)

13:02.549 --> 13:06.117
You're our best chance
of stopping hammer
and getting out of here.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.552
Go! Do what you do!

13:08.020 --> 13:10.088
(yelling)
what does that mean?

13:14.126 --> 13:15.960
(tarzan yell)

13:16.195 --> 13:17.262
(groans)

13:19.565 --> 13:22.100
(rumbling)

13:22.268 --> 13:24.002
Whoa! Hey!

13:24.170 --> 13:25.970
Uh... (clears throat)
thanks.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.107
I'm tony. Mister, uh...

13:29.375 --> 13:33.011
Rock guy? You're not
related to the thing, are you?

13:36.182 --> 13:37.882
Hmm... (chuckles)

13:38.417 --> 13:41.886
(disco music playing)

13:45.090 --> 13:48.526
Skull, baby!
I got the mother of
all updates for ya.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.162
<i>I care only of</i>
<i>the vibranium.</i>

13:51.530 --> 13:54.933
Then how about
a lifetime supply of
indestructible vibranium,

13:54.935 --> 13:57.569
And three avengers?

13:58.170 --> 14:01.039
I'd say this
sweetens the pot.  <i>Nein?</i>

14:01.173 --> 14:05.210
Ja.  <i>If you can hold them</i>
<i>until morning.</i>

14:05.212 --> 14:09.180
<i>And that is</i>
<i>a considerable if,</i>
<i>herr </i> <i>hammer.</i>

14:12.017 --> 14:14.886
S.H.I.E.L.D. Does not
know about this.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.155
(heavy thudding)

14:22.027 --> 14:25.997
I am brok.
You are welcome here.

14:29.368 --> 14:33.104
There have been others
who came before.
We learned from them.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.974
This is great!
With a stone army,

14:35.976 --> 14:37.976
We can take down
hammer in no time.

14:38.244 --> 14:42.614
(sighs)
always, outsiders
want to fight.

14:43.249 --> 14:46.117
We don't fight.
We don't run.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.120
So you just... Sit?

14:49.555 --> 14:53.925
No, sometimes
we craft the silent stone.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.229
And then we sit.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.131
But you've seen
hammer's machine.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.600
It chews right through rock,

15:02.602 --> 15:05.169
And I'm assuming
rock people.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.605
Maybe it's time
for a policy change.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.374
(rumbling)
ah!

15:10.109 --> 15:12.610
That way is not
in our nature.

15:12.978 --> 15:16.447
A thing can only
be what it is.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.383
We are not fighters,

15:18.385 --> 15:22.053
But a tiny sun burns
brightly in you.

15:22.055 --> 15:27.091
You possess the same
powers as the one
who will destroy us.

15:27.093 --> 15:32.130
All I've done on this trip
is run in circles and
almost get eaten.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.643
Before I was a fighter,
I was a builder.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.578
And if you won't fight,

15:47.580 --> 15:50.148
Will you help me?
Help me build?

15:50.349 --> 15:51.549
Hmm.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.652
That we can do.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.024
Red skull:
<i>I am somewhat impressed.</i>

16:00.026 --> 16:02.126
<i>That does not happen often,</i>

16:02.128 --> 16:03.561
Herr  <i>hammer.</i>

16:03.563 --> 16:06.698
Get used to it, skull,
once I join the cabal.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.733
<i>Bring me the body</i>
<i>of tony stark</i>

16:08.735 --> 16:11.135
<i>And you will sit</i>
<i>at my right hand.</i>

16:11.537 --> 16:12.737
Uh, no can do.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.706
My rapto-buddies
searched the area.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.341
There was no body.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.543
Probably some dino's
midnight snack.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.278
<i>Search for him again.</i>

16:20.280 --> 16:22.714
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>destroy the others.</i>

16:23.749 --> 16:25.984
Uh, falcon?

16:25.986 --> 16:28.019
Got any more
of those cookies?

16:33.425 --> 16:34.759
(crashing)

16:37.563 --> 16:40.098
Both: (surprised)
you are kidding me!

16:40.100 --> 16:42.100
Jinx! Owe me a soda. Ha!

16:42.102 --> 16:45.103
Is anyone else gonna say it,
or do I have to?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.471
Let's rock!

16:47.373 --> 16:49.474
(laughing)

16:49.775 --> 16:52.477
This? This is what
you come back with?

16:52.678 --> 16:56.280
Oh, I can't bear to see
how far you've fallen,
anthony.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.116
Boys?

16:58.484 --> 17:00.585
Hey, before
I kick hammer's butt,

17:00.587 --> 17:03.087
Does this count as
using my "natural skills"?

17:03.089 --> 17:04.222
Yes.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.025
Good. I don't wanna
lose another bet.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.063
You're so busy tearing
the savage land apart,

17:12.065 --> 17:14.799
You can't even
see what you could
make with it, hammer.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.137
(guns whir)

17:19.304 --> 17:22.272
That's high-density
crystalline obsidian.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.041
Only needs to be
a centimeter thick

17:24.044 --> 17:26.477
To repel light
and raptor claws.

17:26.646 --> 17:31.215
Vines of the kantua tree
can be vulcanized and woven

17:31.217 --> 17:33.751
To match the tensile
strength of steel.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.120
While also allowing
for elasticity.

17:36.488 --> 17:40.725
That means I can
jump, punch, and move
while covered in rock.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.294
(grunts)

17:43.296 --> 17:46.597
Why do I have a feeling you
knew this was gonna happen?

17:46.599 --> 17:48.066
Because you know me.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.734
And I know tony.
He's a builder.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.669
He doesn't adapt
to fit his situation.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.805
He adapts his situation
to fit him.

17:53.807 --> 17:55.206
Literally. (grunts)

18:06.819 --> 18:09.487
Who was it that said
a rock is just a rock?

18:09.489 --> 18:12.557
Tony: Someone who's
probably realized by now
he was wrong.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.492
How did you do this
in one night?

18:14.726 --> 18:16.627
I'm a natural leader,
remember?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.196
I made friends.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.703
He has shown us
what is possible.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.806
Have faith, brothers
and sisters of stone.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.675
Just sit down

18:30.677 --> 18:31.809
And fire!

18:40.452 --> 18:42.153
Stark! No!

18:42.155 --> 18:43.788
You have to see
what you're doing here.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.124
Look, look, I'll cut you
in on the vibranium.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.159
(phone ringing)
(gasps)

18:48.794 --> 18:51.129
I... Skull! This...

18:51.131 --> 18:55.399
It's nothing. It's just a
minor setback to progress.

18:55.401 --> 18:58.302
This was to be expected,
herr  <i>hammer.</i>

18:58.304 --> 19:01.572
For all of your
self-proclaimed brilliance,

19:01.574 --> 19:04.909
Failure is simply
part of your nature.

19:04.911 --> 19:10.848
<i>If we meet again,</i>
<i>expect it to be unpleasant.</i>

19:12.584 --> 19:13.651
(rumbling)

19:24.229 --> 19:27.932
Never again, stark!
Never again!

19:27.934 --> 19:29.167
Cap, look out!

19:31.837 --> 19:32.870
(all groaning)

19:34.907 --> 19:39.410
Your polished obsidian
didn't hold up to the
hammer 3000, stark.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.347
(powers down)

19:43.349 --> 19:45.183
You know what
your problem is, hammer?

19:45.384 --> 19:47.251
You give tech a bad name.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.487
(hammer grunts)
aw, schnitzel!

19:50.856 --> 19:53.591
That, my friend,
was au naturel.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.960
With the accent on the "ow."

19:56.495 --> 19:58.963
How do you do that
without an iron glove?

19:59.431 --> 20:01.365
Come to training sometime
without your armor,

20:01.367 --> 20:02.667
And we'll work on it.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.238
For a bunch of guys
who like sitting around,

20:07.240 --> 20:08.839
You make excellent missiles.

20:08.841 --> 20:15.546
Jarvis:  <i>I'm happy</i>
<i>to report that the 24-hour</i>
<i>technology ban is over, sir.</i>

20:16.548 --> 20:18.216
Not happier than we are.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.852
Guys, guys?
Haven't you learned anything?

20:21.854 --> 20:24.655
Falcon:
I cannot wait to shower!
Check emails!

20:24.657 --> 20:26.624
Hawkeye:
Give me anything
with an "on" button!

20:26.959 --> 20:30.628
It is our tradition
to give a gift
(frog croaks)

20:30.630 --> 20:32.563
For your victory feast.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.266
That's, uh...

20:35.901 --> 20:36.934
We're vegetarian.

20:36.936 --> 20:40.404
It's rude to refuse a gift.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.907
(frog croaks)

20:43.875 --> 20:46.244
Falcon:
Ah, that's like a hulk-frog!

20:47.946 --> 20:50.414
Like hulk after
shawarma night!

20:50.849 --> 20:54.318
Tony: On second thought,
I did miss my armor.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.388
Especially its air filter
purification system.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.893
Iron man: (over speakers)
<i>knowing I was able</i>
<i>to handle myself</i>

21:02.895 --> 21:04.629
<i>Without all the gizmos...</i>

21:04.631 --> 21:05.830
Not a bad feeling.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.832
When do we start those
training sessions?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.867
As soon as you can
use your gizmos

21:09.869 --> 21:12.036
To get this frog smell
out of my uniform.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.304
(dings)

21:14.973 --> 21:17.608
Huh? Oh...

21:20.312 --> 21:21.812
(hulk sniffs)

21:22.714 --> 21:24.515
Ugh, mint?

21:25.050 --> 21:27.385
Seriously, mint yourself.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.520
Thor: Savages.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.289
(frog croaks)
(exhales and sniffs)
