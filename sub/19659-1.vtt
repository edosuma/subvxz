00:06.267 --> 00:06.967
Olivia's made a rather serious
complaint against you.

00:07.033 --> 00:08.100
She no longer
feels comfortable

00:08.167 --> 00:09.967
working in the same
environment as you.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.167
What?

00:11.233 --> 00:12.433
The truth is
your marriage wasn't

00:12.500 --> 00:14.933
a fucking fun-fair
100% of the time,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.200
so you had to have yourself

00:16.267 --> 00:17.867
a little escape hatch
pussy at the ready.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.400
How's it going, lads?

00:19.467 --> 00:20.967
I was just saying, do you know
who you look like?

00:21.033 --> 00:22.600
Your P.E. teacher?

00:22.667 --> 00:25.300
Rob: I'm just partying
if you want to come up.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.433
You ever been up on
the roof of this place?

00:27.500 --> 00:30.133
It's pretty cool.
You see for, like,
a thousand miles.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.000
Come on, let's go.
I love a good roof.

00:32.067 --> 00:33.367
As I look at you,

00:33.433 --> 00:35.133
all the reasons
I fell in love with you

00:35.200 --> 00:36.233
have come flooding
back so much

00:36.300 --> 00:38.100
that I think
I might throw up.

00:38.167 --> 00:39.767
[grunting]

00:39.833 --> 00:41.700
I love you!

00:42.833 --> 00:43.967
What happened last night?

00:44.033 --> 00:45.033
There's a huge chunk of it
I can't remember.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.633
You went off with your man.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.633
Can I help you?

00:49.700 --> 00:52.167
I need Plan B.
Like a morning-after pill.

00:56.467 --> 00:58.367
What the fuck?

01:03.700 --> 01:05.767
- What?
- What?

01:05.833 --> 01:06.767
Yeah, what?

01:08.867 --> 01:10.167
Nothing.

01:10.233 --> 01:11.833
Well, that didn't
seem like nothing.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.467
Well, sometimes things aren't
always what they seem.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.367
Okay, Alan Turing.

01:17.433 --> 01:18.600
Who?

01:18.667 --> 01:19.700
Alan Turing.

01:19.767 --> 01:20.800
Jesus, Alan Turing?

01:20.867 --> 01:22.200
Yeah, I know who he is.

01:22.267 --> 01:24.033
He's the gay codes guy
that the government murdered.

01:24.100 --> 01:27.100
They didn't murder him.
They castrated him.

01:27.167 --> 01:28.633
And then he killed himself.

01:30.267 --> 01:32.200
I hate this fucking country.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.367
Frankie's sheets
smell of pee.

01:42.433 --> 01:43.900
I forgot
to change them.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.500
This whole room
smells like piss.

01:45.567 --> 01:49.300
Yeah, but baby pee's still
lovely, really, isn't it?

01:49.367 --> 01:52.033
He's not a baby.
He's 3. He eats steak.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.333
Yeah, but it's not
like adult piss,

01:54.400 --> 01:58.600
which is made of, like,
red wine and thrush.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.900
What's wrong
with your face?

02:00.967 --> 02:02.867
Are you farting?
You look creepy.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.867
Actually,
I'm really concerned

02:04.933 --> 02:06.300
I might do something crazy

02:06.367 --> 02:08.133
if you can't satisfactorily
explain to me

02:08.200 --> 02:10.033
what the fuck this is.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.833
What? What?
I don't know.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.067
What is it?
Is that a receipt?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.867
Yeah. It's a receipt,
all right.

02:14.933 --> 02:16.033
Well, can I see it?

02:16.100 --> 02:18.400
You can have it.
I took a picture of it.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.667
Oh, it's a--

02:21.733 --> 02:23.200
That's
a receipt for the--

02:23.267 --> 02:26.033
when we had sex
in Victoria Park.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.433
I was ovulating,

02:27.500 --> 02:28.833
and you did a very big
load in me,

02:28.900 --> 02:31.133
and I know I was ovulating
because I can always tell

02:31.200 --> 02:33.300
because my tits were
much bigger than normal.

02:33.367 --> 02:36.100
You probably noticed.
Well, they were.

02:36.167 --> 02:38.333
And I didn't want
to get into a big debate

02:38.400 --> 02:40.367
about it because we'd only
just got back together,

02:40.433 --> 02:43.533
and, you know, I don't want
another baby, do you?

02:43.600 --> 02:44.767
No way.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.833
What?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.700
You fucking kidding me
with all this?

02:48.767 --> 02:51.200
What are you trying to imply?

02:51.267 --> 02:54.200
Because if you're implying
what I think you're implying,

02:54.267 --> 02:57.167
that's fucking nuts and rude.

02:57.233 --> 02:59.800
Rude? What are you,
a fucking Bronte sister?

02:59.867 --> 03:01.567
Brönte. Brönte sister.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.333
What do you think
I'm implying, Sharon?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.467
Uh, I don't actually even--

03:06.533 --> 03:09.033
because it's so--
I can't even--

03:09.100 --> 03:11.433
What, you think I slept
with someone else or--

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
Did you?

03:13.567 --> 03:14.800
Don't be nuts.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.900
That's nuts.

03:16.967 --> 03:19.467
That-- Rob.
Where are you going?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.500
- Burger King.
- Rob!

03:22.400 --> 03:23.600
[door opens, closes]

03:33.833 --> 03:35.633
I don't know
what I was thinking.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.233
That was crazy.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.700
I worked it all out
on a napkin at Burger King,

03:39.767 --> 03:41.767
and I did do
a big load in you.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.033
That's true.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.200
We didn't use protection.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.033
That's also true.

03:46.100 --> 03:50.067
I just-- I thought
it smelled like a lie.

03:50.133 --> 03:53.400
I don't know how to say it
any other way than that.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.567
I'm sorry.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.500
Well, you don't need
to be sorry.

04:00.567 --> 04:04.533
Look, what isn't crazy
is that in the past,

04:04.600 --> 04:06.300
when I've needed
the morning-after pill,

04:06.367 --> 04:08.133
it has been a discussion.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.100
And why wasn't it
a discussion this time?

04:10.167 --> 04:12.000
Sorry, I'm just--
I'm trying to--

04:12.067 --> 04:13.467
No, no, it's fine.
It's because,

04:13.533 --> 04:15.900
honestly, I barely
thought about it.

04:15.967 --> 04:19.333
I mean, I'm thinking about it
way more now than I did then

04:19.400 --> 04:21.533
because then I just sort of,
you know, just did it.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.000
I was in the pharmacy buying
toothbrushes and shit,

04:25.067 --> 04:26.133
and I remembered
the big load,

04:26.200 --> 04:27.900
and, you know,
I just got the pill.

04:27.967 --> 04:30.433
[chuckle] I even forgot
the toothbrushes.

04:33.133 --> 04:34.600
You forgot the toothbrushes.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.033
I just used a new toothbrush.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.533
Yeah. I got those
in the supermarket

04:40.600 --> 04:43.167
- with the weekly shop.
- Right.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.700
Where's the receipt for those?

04:44.767 --> 04:45.933
What?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.833
I don't save receipts
for everything, do I?

04:47.900 --> 04:49.567
I'm not
fucking Bob Cratchit.

04:49.633 --> 04:54.233
Okay. Well, you should
be saving receipts.

04:54.300 --> 04:57.433
You know, it's hard enough
for me to do British taxes

04:57.500 --> 04:59.800
without you not bothering
to save receipts.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.000
Well, I will now.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.700
Okay?

05:03.767 --> 05:05.133
Jesus.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.100
Do you want to watch
Better Call Saul?

05:09.167 --> 05:12.133
No. I just want
to nestle into your bosom

05:12.200 --> 05:14.167
because I feel stupid.

05:18.367 --> 05:19.433
Aww.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.133
[phone rings]

05:29.500 --> 05:30.533
Hello.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.433
Hey, um, Kate, look,
I'm in a bit of trouble.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.167
For fuck's sake.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.400
What happened now?

05:38.467 --> 05:41.000
Well, nothing.
It's just that-- Shit.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.633
Hey.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.567
- Who were you
on the phone to?
- Harita.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.267
- She wants to meet.
- That's good, isn't it?

05:46.333 --> 05:47.967
I don't know. We'll see.

05:48.033 --> 05:49.233
But it's lunch at Tanaka,

05:49.300 --> 05:50.767
so I don't care
what she has to say.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.067
I'm going.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.867
Well, just, you know,

05:53.933 --> 05:55.333
whatever you decide,
it's your decision.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.767
Just want you to be happy,

05:56.833 --> 05:59.300
and Frankie can always get
his old job back at Nike.

05:59.367 --> 06:00.967
You just want me to be happy?

06:01.033 --> 06:03.067
- That's new.
- No, it's not new.

06:03.133 --> 06:05.367
Why wouldn't I want
my husband to be happy?

06:05.433 --> 06:06.533
And look, I was thinking.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.767
I could look into going
back to work again.

06:08.833 --> 06:11.133
You know, take a bit
of the pressure off. Right?

06:11.200 --> 06:14.000
Oh. Merry Christmas to me.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.867
Harita: What's stopping you
from coming back?

06:24.933 --> 06:27.933
Mostly just the false
sexual harassment charges.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.333
They weren't charges.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.733
It was just a complaint,
which Olivia withdrew.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.367
She was just having
some fun with you.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.233
Yeah. It was a lot of fun.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.433
You should also know

06:35.500 --> 06:36.933
that she's just
accepted a position

06:37.000 --> 06:38.167
at the Brussels office,

06:38.233 --> 06:39.833
so that's no longer
a reason to not come back.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.867
What about Margaret?

06:40.933 --> 06:42.033
Why, do you want
to fuck her as well?

06:42.100 --> 06:44.200
No, but she knows,
so now I hate her too.

06:44.267 --> 06:46.000
Who else knows?

06:46.067 --> 06:47.200
Does Tina from R&D know?

06:47.267 --> 06:49.200
Because she was
unnecessarily vocal

06:49.267 --> 06:50.567
when I ate all of those
hot cross buns

06:50.633 --> 06:52.567
that she brought in
that her daughter
baked one time.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.967
I didn't know
they were homemade.
Because they were terrible.

06:55.033 --> 06:56.600
Why did you eat them all
if they were terrible?

06:56.667 --> 06:57.500
That's not the point.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.900
Margaret knows, okay?
And that's it.

06:59.967 --> 07:02.433
And Tina. Tina knows too.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.033
Oh, come on.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.200
Would you like another tea?

07:05.267 --> 07:07.033
- Yes, please.
- I'll have a Tom Collins.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.233
What's in that?

07:08.300 --> 07:09.267
Bartender will know.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.600
Is it like gin
and lemon juice?

07:10.667 --> 07:11.633
Yep.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.633
Look, I don't know
how long I'll need

07:15.700 --> 07:17.767
a jolly white American
man to sell my ideas.

07:17.833 --> 07:20.333
Hopefully not forever,
but right now I do.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.200
So why don't you take the rest
of your leave of absence--

07:22.267 --> 07:24.733
unpaid. I'm not a charity--

07:24.800 --> 07:26.967
and see how you feel
in a few weeks.

07:27.033 --> 07:28.767
I'll have to think about it.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.833
I mean, you know I didn't
do anything wrong.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.133
- Right?
- Doesn't matter to me.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.900
It doesn't matter to you?

07:35.967 --> 07:38.233
What you offer the company
is more important to me

07:38.300 --> 07:39.533
than whether or not you tried

07:39.600 --> 07:41.567
to fuck a very fuckable
co-worker.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.367
How are the kids?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.567
[slurping]

07:53.933 --> 07:56.400
Well, thought
about your offer,

07:56.467 --> 07:57.433
and I've decided

07:57.500 --> 07:59.533
that I would rather
stick these chopsticks

07:59.600 --> 08:00.633
up my asshole.

08:24.233 --> 08:25.833
You're not jerking it
under there, are you?

08:25.900 --> 08:27.633
No.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.933
Okay. Just checking.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.500
How did it go with Harita?

08:31.567 --> 08:33.833
- She offer you your job back?
- Yep.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.100
You gonna go back?

08:35.167 --> 08:36.600
No. I'm going to find
another one.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.700
Why do you smell
of cheese and onion crisps?

08:42.767 --> 08:43.767
I thought you had sushi.

08:43.833 --> 08:44.867
I was still hungry.

08:44.933 --> 08:46.200
Okay.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.167
How long are you going
to stay in bed for?

08:49.233 --> 08:50.800
Just till tomorrow.

08:50.867 --> 08:52.667
So just the 17 hours?

08:52.733 --> 08:55.300
Well, I got to go out
in a bit,

08:55.367 --> 08:56.933
so you're going
to have to get up

08:57.000 --> 08:58.600
and do the kids' supper
and bath time.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.300
Where are you going?

09:00.367 --> 09:03.233
Ah, just, um, I'm going
to a concert with Melissa.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.567
It's a fundraiser for
a kids' homeless charity--

09:06.633 --> 09:08.333
refugee thing
she volunteers for.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.100
I promised
I'd go with her.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.367
What kind of concert?

09:11.433 --> 09:12.967
Chamber music, I think.
It will be shit.

09:13.033 --> 09:16.300
Wow. You're going to a chamber
music concert with Melissa?

09:16.367 --> 09:17.100
Where?

09:17.167 --> 09:19.367
On the South Bank,
I think.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.000
We're meeting
at a bar before.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.467
She's got the tickets.

09:22.533 --> 09:24.033
Oh, and Frankie's watching
Million Dollar Baby.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.200
I sort of put it on
by mistake,

09:26.267 --> 09:29.800
and now he's really enjoying
it very quietly, so...

09:29.867 --> 09:31.667
Okay.

09:31.733 --> 09:33.033
Have fun at your concerto.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.033
Okay.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.233
Get up.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.933
Hey, why don't we
give you a ride?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.267
No, I'm grand.
I'll just get the tube.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.100
No, it will be fun.
We'll give you a ride.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.033
Don't be silly.
I'll see you later.

09:56.367 --> 09:58.300
[chatter]

10:00.100 --> 10:02.067
* Passed out a few hours *

10:02.133 --> 10:04.067
* But I wanted to stay *

10:06.300 --> 10:07.733
* And the teardrops *

10:07.800 --> 10:09.700
* That are muddled
with the swimming pool *

10:09.767 --> 10:11.433
* My lady do lay *

10:13.200 --> 10:14.367
Two margaritas.

10:14.433 --> 10:16.567
One margarita and a Coke.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.167
No way.

10:18.233 --> 10:20.100
It took two buses
and a half-a-mile walk

10:20.167 --> 10:22.767
along the canal
in kitten heels
to get here.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.167
You're having a drink.

10:24.233 --> 10:25.733
Two margaritas.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.333
[audience members whooping]

10:27.400 --> 10:28.733
Thanks for doing this.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.133
Yeah, no problem.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.133
Nothing to stay home for.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.400
Ian and I haven't
shagged in weeks.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.333
Huh.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.567
He's asked me
to start paying rent.

10:39.467 --> 10:40.500
I wouldn't mind,

10:40.567 --> 10:41.967
but the toilet
on the boat is broken.

10:42.033 --> 10:45.600
Can barely flush half a turd
down at a time.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.700
I'm thinking of moving
back to Ireland.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.567
I miss my girls.

10:49.633 --> 10:50.800
Oh, well, that's great.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.400
- I'm delighted.
- Yeah.

10:52.467 --> 10:55.133
I followed my fanny
for long enough.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.933
Also,
I'm Facebook friends

10:57.000 --> 10:58.433
with this roofer
from Monaghan.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.500
I'm going to hook up with him
when I go back.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.767
Look at him.
Little rock star.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.267
Good body.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.333
How was he in the sack?

11:09.467 --> 11:11.200
[phone dinging]

11:17.367 --> 11:19.600
- Whoo!
- [applause, whistling]

11:21.367 --> 11:23.133
Hey, youse were great.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
Look at us. Groupies.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.533
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.500
So how's it going?

11:28.567 --> 11:30.933
Uh, did you catch
the full set?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.267
Yeah. Yeah, really good.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.067
Really good.
You guys are, um,

11:36.133 --> 11:39.367
you've got all the drums
and the guitars.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.233
The whole kit. Microphone.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.933
Do you want a drink?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.167
Ask the rest of the band.
Call them over.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.867
Oh, here,
I'll call them over.

11:46.933 --> 11:49.100
Hey, do you want
some shots, lads?

11:50.900 --> 11:52.000
We made out.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.333
So we just kissed?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.733
Well, yeah, then, you know.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.700
No, I swear to God
I don't. I don't know.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.467
- You took it out.
- I took it out?

11:59.533 --> 12:00.933
- My dick.
- Your penis?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.567
- Whatever, yeah.
- Christ.

12:03.633 --> 12:05.100
Oh, fucking hell.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.167
I took it out
and did what?

12:07.233 --> 12:08.900
Well, nothing, really.

12:08.967 --> 12:10.100
Every time
you went near it,

12:10.167 --> 12:11.567
you looked like you
were going to gag.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.100
Oh, God.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.633
Then you told me
what you were going to do.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.900
What?

12:16.967 --> 12:18.567
What was I going to do?

12:18.633 --> 12:22.300
You were going to get some
poppers, whatever they are,

12:22.367 --> 12:25.600
and, uh, some weed,
and then you'd come back.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.567
I gave you 40 quid.
You didn't come back.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.500
Okay, I take it back.

12:30.567 --> 12:31.633
No pressure,

12:31.700 --> 12:33.200
but if you did want
to give me that money back,

12:33.267 --> 12:35.733
that would be great.
Uh, I am at uni.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.967
You looked at a cock
for, like, a tick.

12:42.033 --> 12:43.733
You examined it. Big deal.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.933
It's fine.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.667
It's not fine.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.233
I handled a penis that doesn't
belong to my husband.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.400
I held it.
I felt its pulse--

12:51.467 --> 12:53.067
probably.
Rob's never done that.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.033
- [giggling]
- You know what I mean.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.300
He's never just like, oh,

12:57.367 --> 12:59.300
I'll put my hand down
this stranger's pants

12:59.367 --> 13:00.767
and give a little pash.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.233
[snickering]

13:02.300 --> 13:03.733
Give me a fag.
I need to smoke.

13:08.067 --> 13:10.067
Every time Rob does
something nice now--

13:10.133 --> 13:11.667
fucking anything--

13:11.733 --> 13:12.900
if he makes me--

13:12.967 --> 13:14.633
if he makes me
a cheese sandwich,

13:14.700 --> 13:17.133
I'll be like "Oh, great,
a lovely cheese sandwich,

13:17.200 --> 13:20.467
made for me by my husband
who I betrayed with--"

13:20.533 --> 13:22.400
Oh, God, I probably
touched my children

13:22.467 --> 13:23.800
with fresh penis
on my hand.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.300
[chuckling]

13:25.367 --> 13:27.333
I'm going
to have to tell him.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.233
What?

13:28.300 --> 13:29.867
No, you can't tell him.

13:29.933 --> 13:31.733
Stick with the lie.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.400
Seriously.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.267
I mean, if you undo
a lie you've already told,

13:35.333 --> 13:37.100
then really you're
just lying again.

13:37.167 --> 13:39.567
The regrets I feel every day

13:39.633 --> 13:42.500
for not saying I was buying
all that lube for a friend.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.600
I'm not happy.

13:46.933 --> 13:48.033
[sobbing]

13:48.100 --> 13:49.800
Don't want to be a liar.

13:49.867 --> 13:51.833
You don't want
to end up like me.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.867
That's my only bit
of advice.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.167
Lie.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.767
For the kids.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.767
What do you want to do now?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.400
* Drunk as a skunk,
lean as a dean *

14:07.467 --> 14:09.833
* Always the same
since she was 13 *

14:09.900 --> 14:10.833
* You want it, lame duck *

14:10.900 --> 14:12.267
* You want it,
you're out of luck *

14:12.333 --> 14:14.200
* Always been a seedy fuck,
so what's it gonna be? *

14:14.267 --> 14:16.500
* You fuckin' love it,
you fuckin' love it *

14:16.567 --> 14:18.367
* Back on your feet again,
back on the beat again *

14:18.433 --> 14:21.700
* You fuckin' love it,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

14:21.767 --> 14:23.400
[panting]

14:23.467 --> 14:24.600
Uhh.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.233
Uhh!

14:28.300 --> 14:29.100
Ohh.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.733
Ohh! Ohh.

14:37.033 --> 14:39.067
Oh! Oh!

14:39.133 --> 14:41.267
[shrieking]

14:42.500 --> 14:43.567
[gasp]

15:07.933 --> 15:10.033
[snoring]

15:18.967 --> 15:20.100
[snort]

15:22.467 --> 15:26.333
* I love the sound
of breaking glass *

15:29.267 --> 15:32.567
* Especially
when I'm lonely *

15:34.800 --> 15:36.200
[snort] Hoo.

15:36.267 --> 15:38.800
* I need the noises
of destruction *

15:42.267 --> 15:45.267
* When there's nothing new *

15:48.000 --> 15:50.300
* Ohh, nothing new *

15:50.367 --> 15:52.767
* So I'm breaking glass *

15:59.067 --> 16:00.200
I think you should tell him.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.367
Yeah, but if I don't

16:01.433 --> 16:03.000
tell him,
he might not found out,

16:03.067 --> 16:04.500
and if I do tell him,

16:04.567 --> 16:06.100
chances are
he'll fucking find out

16:06.167 --> 16:07.333
because I'm telling him.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.000
Lies are like a child
hiding in a cupboard.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.267
You're always going
to find them.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.467
But if you wait too long,

16:11.533 --> 16:12.667
you might just
find a little corpse.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.967
- Jesus.
- Plus, you're a terrible liar.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.333
I remember at uni,
when you said

16:16.400 --> 16:17.633
you hadn't slept
with Dr. Schiff

16:17.700 --> 16:19.667
- when you had.
- I didn't sleep with him.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.900
- Him?
- Oh. Doctor...

16:21.967 --> 16:23.700
Yeah. No,
I did sleep with her.

16:23.767 --> 16:24.733
Not really, though.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.100
Didn't that feel good?

16:26.167 --> 16:27.567
Yeah. I mean,
it was all right.

16:27.633 --> 16:28.900
Got it out my system,
but--

16:28.967 --> 16:30.800
- I meant telling the truth.
- Oh, yeah.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.567
- Yeah, sure.
- Right, I have to go

16:32.633 --> 16:34.333
because my life coach
has just arrived.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.700
- Okay, sure. Well, can--
- Bye.

16:38.467 --> 16:41.300
...be the best-looking person
but be so ugly in yourself

16:41.367 --> 16:42.567
and it makes you
unattractive.

16:42.633 --> 16:44.567
I did have a lot more
of the other--

16:44.633 --> 16:45.467
[farting]

16:45.533 --> 16:47.000
...uh, when I used to drink.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.033
So you found a receipt

17:17.100 --> 17:19.100
for a pill you've bought
in the past,

17:19.167 --> 17:20.767
and you've got
an uncomfortable feeling

17:20.833 --> 17:22.067
in your tum-tum.
That's it?

17:22.133 --> 17:23.667
Why didn't she tell me?
I mean, it just feels--

17:23.733 --> 17:25.367
Do you tell her every time
you pop to Boots

17:25.433 --> 17:26.667
for a tube
of hemorrhoid cream?

17:26.733 --> 17:28.500
I'd understand if she bought
a fucking speedboat

17:28.567 --> 17:29.500
without telling you.

17:29.567 --> 17:31.133
It's a wee
morning-after pill.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.700
What else was she
supposed to do?

17:32.767 --> 17:34.067
You said yourself

17:34.133 --> 17:35.733
you blew an historic load
into her in a public park.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.133
We have a wavelength.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.433
We communicate verbally
and non-verbally.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.867
Something feels fucked up
and not right.

17:42.933 --> 17:44.467
Okay, let me
ask you something.

17:44.533 --> 17:47.700
Can Sharon hide what she's
feeling about anything?

17:47.767 --> 17:50.467
- No.
- Okay. I wanted you to say it.

17:50.533 --> 17:52.000
So you are
going to find out

17:52.067 --> 17:54.200
one way or another,
sooner or later.

17:54.267 --> 17:56.667
If she's done nothing
wrong, bully for you.

17:56.733 --> 17:59.533
If she has, strangle her,
throw her in a bog,

17:59.600 --> 18:01.000
and when the police
ask if I know anything,

18:01.067 --> 18:03.067
- I'll tell them to get fucked.
- [snickering]

18:04.067 --> 18:05.167
How are you otherwise?

18:05.233 --> 18:07.033
Never better.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.500
Finally got Muireann down.

18:12.567 --> 18:13.467
Great.

18:13.533 --> 18:16.767
Frankie fell asleep
holding a potato.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.100
Little weirdo.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.533
Do you, uh, do you want me
to make you something?

18:23.600 --> 18:24.900
I didn't think
anybody would see this,

18:24.967 --> 18:27.500
but now that you have,
fuck it.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.233
What you get up to today?

18:31.300 --> 18:33.600
I saw Chris,
then I went to a movie.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.767
- What, on your own?
- Yeah.

18:37.467 --> 18:38.333
Why?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.167
Just felt like being alone.

18:40.233 --> 18:42.333
What's the matter?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.033
Nothing.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.600
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

18:49.667 --> 18:51.500
You're giving me
the massive cold shoulder.

18:51.567 --> 18:53.733
Why are you doing that?
You're making me feel shit.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.333
I'm not making you
feel anything.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.167
Well, then you're projecting
your bad mood onto me or--

18:58.233 --> 19:01.000
Am I? At least I'm not
getting secret electrolysis

19:01.067 --> 19:02.400
on my nipples.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.233
Wha-- What?

19:04.300 --> 19:06.267
That was a special offer--

19:06.333 --> 19:07.600
You're going
through my e-mails?

19:07.667 --> 19:09.400
You've never done that
before. Why now?

19:09.467 --> 19:10.833
Who are you doing that for?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.500
Me. I'm tired
of plucking them.

19:12.567 --> 19:13.767
It takes a second.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.867
It takes more than a second,
and it was a special offer.

19:15.933 --> 19:17.567
And did you have
a fantastic time

19:17.633 --> 19:20.967
at your chamber music concerto
on the South Bank with Melissa?

19:21.033 --> 19:22.800
- You're-- You're being--
- Secret birth control.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.800
- ...so fucking suspicious.
- Secret professional
nipple grooming.

19:24.867 --> 19:25.867
You're the one
who got caught lying.

19:25.933 --> 19:28.000
- [thump]
- [crying]

19:29.733 --> 19:30.700
[crying]

19:30.767 --> 19:32.200
Oh, shit.

19:32.267 --> 19:33.867
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, God.

19:33.933 --> 19:35.067
What happened?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.433
Oh, no. He's cut his eye.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.567
He's cut his eye.
He's not okay.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.800
- Where did you park the car?
- I'm trying to remember.

19:40.867 --> 19:42.233
Christ. Did you not
use it last?

19:42.300 --> 19:43.867
No, Rob, where's the car?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.967
I think Curry Street,
I think.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.733
For fuck's sake. Taxi!

19:48.800 --> 19:50.133
Taxi!

19:51.033 --> 19:52.033
Thank you.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.700
What the fuck!

19:58.967 --> 20:01.100
Your light was on.
I got your plate number.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.567
You take us seven blocks
to the hospital,

20:02.633 --> 20:03.900
or I'm going to jump
through this window

20:03.967 --> 20:06.633
and make you eat
your fucking coin purse.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.567
Thank you.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.000
I'm sorry, honey.

20:19.067 --> 20:21.700
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

20:21.767 --> 20:23.467
I'm paranoid.

20:23.533 --> 20:25.000
I mean, I feel--

20:27.500 --> 20:29.533
- When we were apart--
- I took the morning-after pill

20:29.600 --> 20:31.700
because I was worried
I'd slept with a guy
I met in a club.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.033
I was so fucking drunk,

20:33.100 --> 20:34.467
I couldn't remember
if I'd done anything or not.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.267
Like, all I remember
is going up on the roof.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.967
But look, the good news is

20:38.033 --> 20:39.633
I didn't need to take
the morning-after pill

20:39.700 --> 20:42.400
because, as it turns out,
I didn't have sex with him.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.033
- Right.
- I mean, I should have known.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.067
I gave my knickers
a good sniff the next day,

20:47.133 --> 20:49.133
and they just smelt like,
you know, normal bad.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.967
Hello, there. Um,
so do you want to tell me

20:51.033 --> 20:52.633
how you hit your head,
then?

20:52.700 --> 20:55.067
Um, we were downstairs
in the kitchen--

20:55.133 --> 20:56.467
Sorry, actually.

20:56.533 --> 20:58.600
Just need to hear it
from Frankie, if that's okay.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.900
I fell off the chair
in the bathroom.

21:00.967 --> 21:01.967
Nothing happened?

21:02.033 --> 21:03.300
Well, I mean,
nearly nothing.

21:03.367 --> 21:04.900
Like, close to nothing.

21:04.967 --> 21:07.700
If the choices are
nothing and did we fuck,

21:07.767 --> 21:10.067
it's-- you can pretty much
round it down to nothing.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.933
I guess he--
I guess he kissed me.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
He kissed you?
He kissed you?

21:14.067 --> 21:16.167
So you were like mm-mm.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.267
So he forced himself
on you.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.767
Did you
file a police report?

21:19.833 --> 21:21.433
I mean, so a man kissed you
against your will.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.367
Okay we--
we kissed, apparently.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.533
Do you know if Frankie's
vomited at all?

21:26.600 --> 21:28.333
Um, no. No, he has not.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.133
What did you mean,
apparently?

21:30.200 --> 21:32.000
- Pardon?
- Oh, talking to her.

21:32.067 --> 21:33.333
- So sorry.
- I can only go

21:33.400 --> 21:34.733
by what he told me. Okay?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.900
Hey, no one wants to know
what happened more than me.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.167
You went to see him.

21:38.233 --> 21:39.467
Just to find out
what happened.

21:39.533 --> 21:40.633
What happened?

21:44.233 --> 21:45.767
I handled his penis.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.967
Okay,
someone else's penis,

21:48.033 --> 21:49.967
and-- but that is as bad
as this story gets.

21:50.033 --> 21:52.800
I took a man's penis
out of his pants,

21:52.867 --> 21:54.600
and I-- I looked at it,

21:54.667 --> 21:57.433
like, for a second.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.233
But apart from that,
nothing happened.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.933
Nurse: Okay, well,
Frankie's been good enough

22:02.000 --> 22:03.133
to tell me what's happened.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.567
We'll see if it needs
a little stitch,

22:04.633 --> 22:06.367
but probably not
by the looks of it.

22:06.433 --> 22:07.867
Can I get his blood type?

22:07.933 --> 22:11.000
Um, he's, um, he's type O.

22:11.067 --> 22:13.267
Great, okay, when was
his last tetanus shot?

22:13.333 --> 22:14.433
It was 5 months ago.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.533
Okey-doke.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.300
It was the day after he
went back to nursery.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.700
Right.

22:18.767 --> 22:20.233
A squirrel bit him.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.400
Oh.

22:28.233 --> 22:30.800
You're a fascinating
person, you know that?

22:30.867 --> 22:32.467
I mean,
you're multi-faceted.

22:32.533 --> 22:34.300
You're a genuinely
good mother.

22:34.367 --> 22:37.200
You handled that lazy
doctor really well.

22:37.267 --> 22:39.567
You were calm. You asked
all the right questions.

22:39.633 --> 22:42.467
Considering
what a shit wife you are,

22:42.533 --> 22:44.333
it's a fascinating
collision of skills.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.833
I'm not a shit wife.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.033
What if I cut open my eye?

22:49.100 --> 22:51.300
I mean,
best best case scenario:

22:51.367 --> 22:52.967
you'd let me use
your Oyster card.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.100
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.933
And then you'd text me
a shopping list

22:57.000 --> 22:58.567
while I'm
in the emergency room.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.933
Do you want
to break up with me?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.400
Do I want to break up
with you?

23:11.467 --> 23:12.467
What are we, 14?

23:12.533 --> 23:15.133
Well, what do you
want to do?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.933
I know you think
I'm a terrible person,

23:17.000 --> 23:18.267
but I guess I was--
I was angry.

23:18.333 --> 23:19.967
Don't do that.
Don't blame me.

23:20.033 --> 23:21.667
I was upset
about the money

23:21.733 --> 23:24.200
you gave Fergal
and the French hussy

23:24.267 --> 23:26.200
and the fact that, you know,
you wouldn't apologize

23:26.267 --> 23:28.167
or admit that you'd
done anything wrong,

23:28.233 --> 23:29.700
and you know,
it's a tough time.

23:29.767 --> 23:32.433
There's a lot of...
Brexit,

23:32.500 --> 23:33.800
you know,
your new president.

23:33.867 --> 23:34.967
Don't put that on me.

23:35.033 --> 23:36.767
Well, I'm just saying
it's a tough time.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.467
Fuck you for a second, okay?

23:38.533 --> 23:40.367
Fuck your guilt
or whatever.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.267
The bottom line
is they need a mom,

23:42.333 --> 23:45.500
and I hate the idea
of whatever you did with him

23:45.567 --> 23:47.300
less than I love them.

23:47.367 --> 23:49.533
And what are the other
options? I leave you?

23:49.600 --> 23:51.333
I split up our family?

23:51.400 --> 23:54.233
I'm just going to have
to suck it up, aren't I?

23:55.967 --> 23:57.300
Okay.

24:01.067 --> 24:02.500
What did he look like?

24:02.567 --> 24:04.500
- What did he--
- Was he black?

24:04.567 --> 24:07.333
No. Why? What difference
would that make?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.867
Well, you said
he wasn't, so--

24:08.933 --> 24:10.233
No, but why?

24:10.300 --> 24:11.533
Because I've seen your
browser history, okay?

24:11.600 --> 24:14.733
It's primarily black guys
and fat Johnny Depp,

24:14.800 --> 24:16.367
and I can't
compete with that.

24:16.433 --> 24:17.533
Are you--

24:20.367 --> 24:22.133
You don't have to compete.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.933
And the fat Johnny Depps,
that was--

24:24.000 --> 24:25.833
- I was just fascinated.
- I don't want to hear it.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.000
Okay. I'm sorry.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.633
Sorry.

24:29.967 --> 24:32.533
I mean, what now?

24:32.600 --> 24:33.767
I don't know.

24:33.833 --> 24:36.933
I guess over time I'll have
to learn to forgive you.

24:37.000 --> 24:37.967
Right.

24:38.033 --> 24:39.767
Over how much time?

24:39.833 --> 24:40.933
I don't know.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.733
I guess it will take
two or three months?

24:42.800 --> 24:44.700
- A season?
- A season.

24:46.300 --> 24:47.500
What are you doing?

24:47.567 --> 24:49.500
I'm just-- I'm just
trying to work out

24:49.567 --> 24:50.933
if we'll be okay
by my birthday.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.267
No.

24:52.333 --> 24:55.933
I'm thinking we might
be okay by Thanksgiving.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.267
When's that?

24:57.333 --> 25:00.267
Look, sorry. I--
I'll look it up.

25:02.233 --> 25:03.333
Do you want me
to sleep on the sofa?

25:03.400 --> 25:05.300
Or we could sleep
in the same bed

25:05.367 --> 25:07.533
but just, you know,
head to toe.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.100
No. I don't want you
to lacerate my face

25:10.167 --> 25:12.767
with your White Walker
toenails.

25:23.167 --> 25:25.500
Do you still love me?

25:25.567 --> 25:28.733
Actually, yeah, maybe you
should sleep on the couch.

25:34.233 --> 25:38.033
