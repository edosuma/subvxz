WEBVTT

02:03.490 --> 02:05.960
Hey. Come on.

02:05.994 --> 02:07.562
Beat it.

02:20.842 --> 02:22.510
Stay.

04:06.279 --> 04:08.116
Hmm.

05:12.814 --> 05:13.881
Am I late?

05:13.915 --> 05:15.315
Oh, no! Hi, Dad.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.217
Hi.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.350
Hi. How're you feeling?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.253
I'm fine, I'm fine.

05:27.862 --> 05:29.831
Chris was
supposed to graduate this year,

05:29.864 --> 05:31.065
but because of the divorce,

05:31.098 --> 05:33.100
he's just gonna take
a semester off.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.736
Take a semester off?

05:35.770 --> 05:37.404
Yeah, he wants to travel.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.406
He's saved up some money,
and...

05:39.439 --> 05:41.008
You should come by the house.
He really misses you.

05:41.042 --> 05:44.545
Well, Renee, I'm... uh...

05:44.579 --> 05:45.746
I'm going to take a few days

05:45.780 --> 05:48.249
I'm going to go hunting
in my old stomping grounds,

05:48.282 --> 05:49.750
and I'm leaving in the morning.

05:51.052 --> 05:52.753
Oh! Who's going with you?

05:52.787 --> 05:54.222
Rex...

05:54.255 --> 05:55.223
and me.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.926
I've been thinking about it...

05:58.960 --> 06:00.928
for a while.

06:00.962 --> 06:02.362
Are you gonna go see
Uncle Aidan?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.701
No.

06:06.734 --> 06:07.735
I just thought that

06:07.768 --> 06:09.570
maybe now things
would be different than...

06:09.604 --> 06:10.972
What would be different?

06:15.710 --> 06:17.377
So when will you be back?

06:17.410 --> 06:18.613
Uh...

06:18.646 --> 06:19.614
Thursday or Friday.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.049
I'm okay, I'm just fine!

06:22.083 --> 06:23.951
I just wanna go
over the mountains,

06:23.985 --> 06:26.354
and let the dog run around,

06:26.386 --> 06:27.588
and walk a little.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.624
Okay.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.392
When you come back,
we're gonna have a serious talk.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.728
A serious talk.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.729
Yes.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.598
About you coming
to live with us.

06:38.733 --> 06:39.700
You know.

06:39.734 --> 06:40.902
If you have to start treatment...

06:40.935 --> 06:42.904
If.

06:42.937 --> 06:45.239
I haven't heard back
from the doctors at all.

06:45.273 --> 06:47.808
So it doesn't make sense
to talk about anything.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.878
Doesn't make sense.

06:50.912 --> 06:52.445
No.

06:52.479 --> 06:53.748
Well, you know
that's what you say

06:53.781 --> 06:55.448
when you just don't want
to talk about something. right?

06:55.482 --> 06:57.852
Well, I just don't want
to talk about it!

06:58.953 --> 07:00.288
Just like you don't want
to talk about Mom...

07:05.026 --> 07:05.993
It's...

07:06.027 --> 07:08.229
it's late.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.097
Dad, I'm sorry, I'm not trying
to box you in or anything.

07:10.131 --> 07:11.666
Chris is in college now

07:11.699 --> 07:13.100
and you just need
someone to take care of.

07:13.134 --> 07:14.168
No!

07:14.201 --> 07:15.770
I'm just concerned
about your health, Dad.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.838
I'm not sure my health
is your business.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.346
I've barely seen you
since mom died.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.582
I miss you.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.284
And I just want to spend
some time together.

07:38.359 --> 07:40.493
I... I'm sorry.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.862
I have to go.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.030
Dad...

09:04.879 --> 09:06.714
Come on.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.423
Come on. Up you go.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.092
Up you go. Come on.

09:39.914 --> 09:41.649
<i>Please
leave a message after the tone.</i>

09:43.484 --> 09:44.952
<i>Hi, Dad, it's Renee.</i>

09:44.985 --> 09:46.754
<i>I hope I catch you
before you leave.</i>

09:46.787 --> 09:48.122
<i>I'm sorry about
last night.</i>

09:48.155 --> 09:50.257
<i>I didn't mean to offend you
or upset you.</i>

09:50.291 --> 09:51.725
<i>I'm just not feeling that great</i>

09:51.759 --> 09:54.795
<i>about this trip that you want
to take all alone.</i>

09:54.829 --> 09:57.498
<i>Will you please call me back
when you get this message?</i>

09:57.532 --> 09:58.499
<i>Thank you, Dad.</i>

09:58.533 --> 10:00.901
<i>Love you.</i>

10:00.935 --> 10:02.269
<i>Bye.</i>

12:02.557 --> 12:04.258
Oh!

12:05.759 --> 12:07.394
Oh, Jesus.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.516
Hey, how's it going?

13:02.816 --> 13:04.051
Well, not great.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.354
You got some car trouble?

13:10.190 --> 13:11.492
Yeah.

13:11.526 --> 13:12.661
Need a ride?

13:12.694 --> 13:13.927
Well, I could use one.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.196
I've got a dog, however,
and, um...

13:16.230 --> 13:17.298
some other things.

13:17.331 --> 13:18.365
That's not a problem.

13:18.399 --> 13:19.333
Okay.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.168
- Thanks.
- Need some help?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.178
No service.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.882
What are you gonna do
with your car?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.083
I'll take care of it.

13:37.585 --> 13:39.019
Where you want us to take you?

13:39.053 --> 13:41.523
I was thinking of hunting
up in Frenchman Coulee.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.191
Meeting friends up there.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.228
Sweet climbing spot.

13:48.262 --> 13:49.096
Perfect.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.201
Look, I don't want
to take you out of your way.

13:55.336 --> 13:57.271
We're super flexible.
It's not a problem.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.709
I appreciate it, really.
I do appreciate it.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.527
What's his name?

14:20.695 --> 14:21.962
Oh, that's Rex.

14:24.632 --> 14:25.499
Are you from around here?

14:25.533 --> 14:27.067
Oh, I used to be.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.739
Do you still have
family out here?

14:33.374 --> 14:34.776
Not really.

14:49.423 --> 14:50.625
Are you okay?

14:51.726 --> 14:53.127
Oh, yeah, it's just...

14:53.160 --> 14:54.428
bad back.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.364
I'm okay.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.301
Stay.

15:41.643 --> 15:42.677
You got everything?

15:42.710 --> 15:44.077
Yeah. I'm fine.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.245
I appreciate you doing this.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.280
Giving me a ride.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.317
Um. Here you go.

15:51.485 --> 15:52.554
Uh. Some snacks for later.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.490
We thought you could use it.

15:56.524 --> 15:59.493
Oh, that's really sweet of you.

15:59.527 --> 16:00.862
Thank you very much.

16:00.895 --> 16:02.029
You sure you're gonna be
all right out here?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.297
I'm gonna be fine.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.298
Okay.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.300
I'm gonna be just fine.
Thank you.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.769
You have a good climb?

16:07.802 --> 16:08.803
Thanks.

16:08.837 --> 16:09.904
Okay.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.577
- Bye, Ben!
- So long.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.340
Come on.

16:51.846 --> 16:53.848
Come on, come on.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.519
Come on.

17:38.793 --> 17:40.494
Ah.

17:42.664 --> 17:43.665
Okay, here we go.

18:00.648 --> 18:01.816
Okay, let's go hunting.

18:04.586 --> 18:05.620
Hold up.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.156
Hunt 'em up.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.814
Hmm.

20:49.984 --> 20:51.652
Yeah.

21:56.984 --> 21:58.418
Okay.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.746
Whoo!

23:52.432 --> 23:53.601
Rex!

23:55.435 --> 23:57.772
Dammit.

23:57.805 --> 23:59.439
Rex!

24:09.116 --> 24:10.384
Rex!

24:17.892 --> 24:19.827
Get off!

24:19.860 --> 24:21.395
Get off, dammit!

24:34.675 --> 24:36.377
Oh, God.

24:46.554 --> 24:49.690
Hey. You alone down there?

24:49.724 --> 24:51.158
Can you help me?

24:52.193 --> 24:53.327
My dog's hurt.

25:00.668 --> 25:02.236
You fuckin' shoot my dog?

25:03.337 --> 25:05.039
Your dog had my dog
by the throat.

25:05.072 --> 25:07.541
You coulda just
kicked him off.

25:07.575 --> 25:09.143
Give him a good kick,
my dog'll listen.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.145
I did that.

25:11.178 --> 25:12.179
He wasn't listenin'.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.324
Damn it.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.526
Your dog was gonna
rip my dog's throat out.

25:32.566 --> 25:34.935
Maybe I ought
to shoot your dog, too.

25:36.937 --> 25:38.606
You get down on the ground now.

25:45.079 --> 25:46.547
Turn your head away.

26:04.265 --> 26:05.699
You killed my dog.

26:05.733 --> 26:06.734
I'm takin' your gun.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.202
I need that gun.

26:08.235 --> 26:09.437
Shoulda thought of that

26:09.470 --> 26:11.439
before you shot
my best coyote dog.

26:35.362 --> 26:36.430
Good boy.

26:36.464 --> 26:37.431
Hold still...

26:37.465 --> 26:39.066
Hold still.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.841
Okay.

26:54.782 --> 26:55.783
Okay.

27:08.829 --> 27:10.197
I know.

27:11.398 --> 27:13.067
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

29:16.524 --> 29:17.958
Shh.

30:07.174 --> 30:08.876
Hey.

30:08.909 --> 30:10.210
Hey.

30:10.244 --> 30:11.378
Do you need help?

30:12.379 --> 30:14.381
My dog needs help.

30:15.750 --> 30:17.184
Let's get you into my truck.

30:40.174 --> 30:41.141
A vet I know.

30:41.175 --> 30:43.344
She's going to open her clinic.

31:12.039 --> 31:13.040
You're awake.

31:15.710 --> 31:17.044
You were sound asleep.

31:22.116 --> 31:23.818
He seems to be doing okay
back there.

31:29.624 --> 31:30.625
Anita's here.

31:44.672 --> 31:45.707
Are you the owner?

31:45.740 --> 31:46.641
I am, yes.

31:46.674 --> 31:48.041
Thank you for coming out.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.143
Yeah, of course.

31:49.176 --> 31:50.745
I mean, when he asks me,
how could I say no?

31:54.649 --> 31:56.483
I'm going to open up
the clinic for us, okay?

31:56.518 --> 31:57.484
Okay.

31:57.519 --> 32:00.120
Thanks again.
I owe you something.

32:00.154 --> 32:01.955
No, you don't.

32:01.989 --> 32:03.858
It's not necessary.

32:06.960 --> 32:07.961
Okay.

32:14.101 --> 32:15.102
Ooh...

32:16.638 --> 32:17.639
Are these your stitches?

32:17.672 --> 32:19.106
Yeah.

32:19.139 --> 32:20.407
You a doctor or something?

32:20.441 --> 32:21.543
I was.

32:22.811 --> 32:23.812
What happened?

32:25.847 --> 32:26.915
Dog fight?

32:26.947 --> 32:28.716
Yeah.

32:31.218 --> 32:32.186
Where?

32:32.219 --> 32:33.454
Bird hunting.

32:33.487 --> 32:34.722
Okay...

32:35.857 --> 32:36.990
I'm going to give him
some fluids.

32:37.024 --> 32:39.293
I need to cut out your stitches,

32:39.326 --> 32:40.327
clean him up, sew him up.

32:42.129 --> 32:44.097
I'd say about $500?

32:44.131 --> 32:45.299
Okay.

32:45.332 --> 32:49.069
And he's going to need
to be here a couple nights.

32:52.907 --> 32:53.908
How are your hands?

32:56.644 --> 32:57.812
They're okay.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.347
They're still good.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.282
I don't have anyone
coming to help me.

33:02.316 --> 33:04.051
And I would like
to get some rest

33:04.084 --> 33:06.053
before I have to
come in tomorrow.

33:06.086 --> 33:07.387
You mind helping out?

33:07.421 --> 33:08.422
Okay.

33:15.830 --> 33:17.966
All right, I'm gonna give him...

33:17.998 --> 33:23.738
.32 mils of Dex...

33:26.173 --> 33:27.509
Good job.

33:29.711 --> 33:32.680
And now something for the pain.

33:34.549 --> 33:36.049
Good job, baby.

33:52.466 --> 33:54.101
You don't mind the music,
do you?

33:54.134 --> 33:55.469
No.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.338
That's lucky

33:58.372 --> 33:59.741
because the other answer

33:59.774 --> 34:01.041
would have you
waiting in the lobby,

34:01.074 --> 34:03.545
where you'd still be able
to hear the music.

34:10.284 --> 34:11.251
You do these one-handed?

34:11.284 --> 34:12.987
I did.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.590
They're not bad.

34:16.623 --> 34:19.059
I was a cardiac surgeon
for 50 years in Seattle.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.030
Oh.

34:22.062 --> 34:23.230
You got stories?

34:23.263 --> 34:24.831
Yeah.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.071
Just, you know,
trying to pass the time.

34:32.172 --> 34:33.942
It will pass on its own.

34:38.813 --> 34:40.982
3-0 Weblon
with reverse cutting needle.

34:45.652 --> 34:47.286
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

35:08.442 --> 35:09.443
That's very nice.

35:11.478 --> 35:12.479
I know.

35:14.381 --> 35:15.349
But thanks.

35:21.022 --> 35:22.322
Okay, so I have someone

35:22.356 --> 35:25.627
who comes in
a little later tonight.

35:25.660 --> 35:26.794
She should be here shortly.

35:27.829 --> 35:28.796
What about you?

35:28.830 --> 35:31.198
You got a place
to stay tonight?

35:31.231 --> 35:33.200
There's a motel
up the street.

35:33.233 --> 35:36.037
It's on the way home.
I can drop you off.

35:36.070 --> 35:37.639
Okay.

35:46.981 --> 35:49.216
Wow, this town
sure has changed.

35:49.249 --> 35:50.885
Change is good.

35:52.219 --> 35:54.055
I could not get out of here
fast enough.

35:54.088 --> 35:55.089
Why'd you come back?

35:57.157 --> 35:58.458
My brother died.

35:58.492 --> 36:00.862
And my nephew needed
a stable home.

36:02.930 --> 36:03.931
Mm-hmm.

36:06.668 --> 36:08.301
Well, thank you
for taking care of the dog.

36:08.335 --> 36:09.570
I really appreciate that.

36:09.604 --> 36:11.238
Yeah, no problem.

36:11.271 --> 36:12.507
All right, good night.

36:12.540 --> 36:13.975
And thanks for the ride.

36:14.008 --> 36:15.175
Get some rest.

36:15.208 --> 36:16.209
Yeah.

38:06.353 --> 38:07.989
All right.
See you later.

38:11.491 --> 38:13.761
Yes, I brought
the Brittany in last night.

38:13.795 --> 38:15.029
Are you Ben Gibbons?

38:15.062 --> 38:16.329
Anita told me about you.

38:22.170 --> 38:23.403
Okay.

38:26.908 --> 38:28.109
I heard you carried him
all day yesterday

38:28.142 --> 38:29.644
after he was attacked.

38:29.677 --> 38:31.378
He sure wasn't
going to carry me.

38:34.081 --> 38:35.750
Like carrying
my buddy in the war.

38:36.751 --> 38:37.718
World War II?

38:37.752 --> 38:40.087
Korean War.

38:42.223 --> 38:43.490
How are you doing?

38:43.524 --> 38:45.726
Ben! What're you doing here?
I thought you'd still be asleep!

38:45.760 --> 38:47.795
Hi! Uh...

38:47.829 --> 38:48.830
I had to see him.

38:48.863 --> 38:49.831
He's been through a lot,

38:49.864 --> 38:51.532
so he just needs some rest.

38:52.667 --> 38:54.635
- Yeah.
- Hey.

38:54.669 --> 38:56.737
I have your number
at the motel.

38:56.771 --> 38:58.139
I gotcha.

38:58.172 --> 38:59.640
Okay.

38:59.674 --> 39:00.842
Come on, Derek.
I need your help with something.

39:00.875 --> 39:02.009
- Thank you.
- All right, see you later.

39:02.043 --> 39:03.343
Appreciate it.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.460
Hey.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.170
You're usually faster than this.

40:39.340 --> 40:40.975
I can do this all day.

40:42.944 --> 40:45.112
You'll be doing it all day
if you keep that up.

40:47.515 --> 40:48.516
Yeah...

41:33.094 --> 41:34.395
Hello?

41:34.428 --> 41:37.031
<i>Hi, Ben.
It's Anita.</i>

41:38.265 --> 41:40.835
Oh, Anita. Yes, uh...

41:40.868 --> 41:42.837
How's Rex?

41:42.870 --> 41:44.305
<i>I looked in on him
before we left.</i>

41:44.338 --> 41:46.440
<i>His vitals look a lot better.</i>

41:47.842 --> 41:49.310
Oh! Okay.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.012
<i>Have you had dinner yet?</i>

41:52.380 --> 41:54.715
No? Dinner?

41:54.749 --> 41:56.417
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:56.450 --> 41:58.919
<i>I'm going to be passing by
in about five minutes.</i>

41:58.953 --> 42:01.355
<i>If I slow down enough,
you think you could jump in?</i>

42:01.389 --> 42:02.723
Jump in?

42:02.757 --> 42:04.258
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:04.291 --> 42:05.893
<i>Come have dinner at my house.</i>

42:05.926 --> 42:07.495
<i>I mean, we sewed up
a dog together.</i>

42:07.528 --> 42:09.997
<i>I think we could at least
make it through a dinner, no?</i>

42:10.031 --> 42:11.665
Oh!

42:11.699 --> 42:15.403
Well, sure, I guess.

42:15.436 --> 42:16.670
Yes, that's fine.

42:16.704 --> 42:18.105
Thank you very much.

42:18.139 --> 42:19.840
I'll see you in five minutes.

42:19.874 --> 42:21.542
<i>Okay, bye!</i>

42:21.575 --> 42:23.377
Bye.

42:25.046 --> 42:27.248
Yeah, okay.
Adios. Gracias.

42:29.216 --> 42:31.052
Hey, hey, hey.

42:31.085 --> 42:33.120
Did I mention I don't cook?

42:33.154 --> 42:34.155
Here you go.

42:35.156 --> 42:36.490
Well, thank you.

42:37.892 --> 42:41.062
Yeah, cooking is just
way too claustrophobic for me.

42:41.095 --> 42:43.931
It's like the walls
start to close in and... no.

42:43.964 --> 42:45.099
Derek though.

42:45.132 --> 42:46.367
Derek is a really good cook.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.369
- Cooks dinner most nights, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

42:52.840 --> 42:53.808
How are the tacos?

42:53.841 --> 42:54.809
Not spicy, right?

42:58.279 --> 42:59.780
My mouth is full.

43:00.848 --> 43:02.383
Told you.

43:02.416 --> 43:05.086
The owner
made it special for you.

43:05.119 --> 43:06.987
Oh, well, that was very nice.

43:08.622 --> 43:10.991
Lot more brown faces here
than when you were a kid, huh?

43:12.093 --> 43:13.060
Ah...

43:13.094 --> 43:14.428
most the pickers

43:14.462 --> 43:17.364
came from Arkansas and Oklahoma
in those days.

43:22.136 --> 43:23.204
Is that a marine plaque?

43:25.439 --> 43:26.807
Yeah...

43:29.977 --> 43:31.345
I joined,

43:31.378 --> 43:32.847
after my brother did.

43:32.880 --> 43:33.848
Derek's dad.

43:33.881 --> 43:35.349
Okay.

43:37.051 --> 43:38.752
- Where were ya?
- Iraq.

43:38.786 --> 43:40.522
Then Afghanistan.

43:40.555 --> 43:41.889
Oh, boy.

43:42.890 --> 43:43.924
Y'all right?

43:43.958 --> 43:46.193
Yeah.

43:46.227 --> 43:47.294
Ben was in Korea.

43:47.328 --> 43:49.296
Huh.

43:49.330 --> 43:50.931
Were you a doctor out there?

43:50.965 --> 43:52.299
Oh, no, no, no...

43:52.333 --> 43:54.335
That's...

43:54.368 --> 43:55.970
where I thought
I might be a doctor.

43:56.003 --> 43:56.971
Yeah.

43:57.004 --> 43:58.507
Did something happen?

44:00.007 --> 44:02.577
Yeah, my buddy got shot up
pretty much.

44:04.579 --> 44:07.047
I had to haul him back
to his aid station.

44:07.081 --> 44:08.682
I put him over my shoulder...

44:10.084 --> 44:12.052
and got there
and there was no pulse...

44:12.086 --> 44:14.523
so the doctor did what he could.

44:16.223 --> 44:19.026
And I was there,
watching it all,

44:19.059 --> 44:20.828
and...

44:20.861 --> 44:23.964
he had to slice
the side of him

44:23.998 --> 44:26.467
so he could reach inside.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.235
And he's telling me all this.

44:30.171 --> 44:32.239
He puts the heart
in his hand.

44:32.273 --> 44:33.642
Inside.

44:33.674 --> 44:35.644
Starts squeezing it.

44:35.676 --> 44:38.379
He said,
"You kind of squeeze it...

44:38.412 --> 44:40.247
like a new sponge."

44:40.281 --> 44:42.149
Squeeze it...

44:42.183 --> 44:43.484
squeeze it...

44:43.518 --> 44:45.554
not too hard...

44:45.587 --> 44:49.023
squeeze it
so there's a rhythm to it.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.027
And...

44:53.060 --> 44:54.228
suddenly, there's a pulse.

44:55.597 --> 44:56.830
Wow.

44:56.864 --> 45:00.034
And, uh...

45:00.067 --> 45:01.769
my buddy went home,
got married,

45:01.802 --> 45:03.470
and had four kids.

45:05.706 --> 45:09.578
And I went to medical school,

45:09.611 --> 45:11.879
got married,

45:11.912 --> 45:13.582
and I have a beautiful daughter.

45:36.070 --> 45:37.606
<i>I'm takin' your gun.</i>

45:57.626 --> 46:00.494
What are you doing here, Ben?

46:00.528 --> 46:01.996
What do you mean?

46:03.430 --> 46:05.833
I mean, your car breaks down,
and you just abandon it.

46:09.537 --> 46:10.838
Yeah?

46:10.871 --> 46:13.240
I feel like you would've
gotten your car fixed

46:13.274 --> 46:15.610
and maybe even
come back to Seattle.

46:17.478 --> 46:18.680
But you didn't.

46:18.713 --> 46:19.880
You kept going.

46:21.949 --> 46:23.817
This trip must have been
really important to you.

46:29.356 --> 46:30.558
I have cancer.

46:36.797 --> 46:37.998
Have you told your family?

46:41.670 --> 46:44.038
My wife died a year ago.

46:46.807 --> 46:48.008
What about your daughter?

46:54.014 --> 46:55.650
She's going to find out
eventually.

46:59.053 --> 47:00.321
I know.

47:03.924 --> 47:05.426
You don't know
what's going to happen.

47:06.761 --> 47:08.228
But I do.

47:09.764 --> 47:11.666
I know exactly
what's going to happen.

47:13.367 --> 47:14.703
Bedsores and bone fractures,

47:14.736 --> 47:17.471
bacterial infection,
fluid in my lungs,

47:17.505 --> 47:18.506
vomiting,

47:18.540 --> 47:19.507
dehydration,

47:19.541 --> 47:20.908
cracked lips,

47:20.941 --> 47:22.811
dry mouth, pneumonia,

47:22.843 --> 47:25.179
the sensation
of being strangled at the end,

47:25.212 --> 47:26.347
and a final drip of morphine.

47:26.380 --> 47:27.615
That's what's going to happen.

47:30.518 --> 47:31.519
That's how it would end.

47:33.020 --> 47:34.589
If I let it.

48:24.572 --> 48:26.039
You miss your home at all?

48:26.073 --> 48:27.374
You know what I miss?

48:27.408 --> 48:29.577
Fireflies!

48:29.611 --> 48:31.278
- You ever see them?
- No.

48:32.847 --> 48:34.348
<i>They're magical.</i>

48:37.084 --> 48:39.687
<i>Come on! Let's go!
I wanna dance with you.</i>

48:40.755 --> 48:42.189
<i>Okay, okay, I'll dance.</i>

51:20.748 --> 51:22.750
Good Morning, Sunshine.

51:24.786 --> 51:26.688
Good morning!

51:29.189 --> 51:30.324
I'm sorry...

51:30.357 --> 51:33.126
I...

51:33.160 --> 51:34.562
I fell asleep on ya.

51:34.596 --> 51:36.096
Yeah, damn near mid-sentence.

51:37.264 --> 51:39.634
It's all good,
I didn't want to wake you up.

51:45.773 --> 51:47.775
Well, I made you some tea,

51:47.809 --> 51:49.677
I washed your shirts,

51:49.711 --> 51:51.613
and there is breakfast
in the kitchen,

51:51.646 --> 51:52.680
whenever you're ready.

51:52.714 --> 51:55.248
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah. No problem.

51:55.282 --> 51:57.919
Take your time.

51:57.952 --> 51:59.353
Okay.

52:08.663 --> 52:10.765
<i>All right, see ya.</i>

52:10.798 --> 52:12.700
Thank you for the ride.

52:12.734 --> 52:14.201
You betcha.
See ya later.

52:14.234 --> 52:15.670
Okay.

54:03.644 --> 54:05.113
Huh.

54:31.506 --> 54:33.775
This paper has to come out
whether there's any news or not.

54:33.808 --> 54:34.809
You ever think about that?

54:36.944 --> 54:39.346
"Honoring Barrows.

54:39.379 --> 54:42.449
Former Mayor Clint Barrows
receives plaque for service."

54:43.518 --> 54:44.519
Breaking news.

54:44.552 --> 54:47.320
Two months ago.
you sat in that same chair,

54:47.354 --> 54:49.422
pushed your beer aside,

54:49.456 --> 54:50.858
kindly said,

54:50.892 --> 54:52.260
"This paper has to come out

54:52.292 --> 54:54.095
whether there's any news
or not."

54:54.128 --> 54:55.530
And then you read the headlines.

54:57.464 --> 55:00.134
S'cuse me, gentlemen.

55:00.168 --> 55:01.769
You don't happen to know
anyone around here

55:01.803 --> 55:02.870
that handles coyotes.

55:02.904 --> 55:04.539
You got a problem with coyotes?

55:04.572 --> 55:08.943
Ah. You're looking for
a man named Harden.

55:08.976 --> 55:10.111
What's his nephew's first name?

55:10.144 --> 55:11.112
Ethan.

55:11.145 --> 55:13.047
No, no. Ethan's his cousin.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.048
The nephew...

55:14.081 --> 55:15.049
Bill.

55:15.082 --> 55:17.718
Bill! Harden. Yeah.

55:17.752 --> 55:20.387
Lives up
on his uncle's orchards.

55:20.420 --> 55:22.957
He runs his dogs
down here sometimes.

55:22.990 --> 55:25.325
Hires 'em out
to hunt coyotes.

55:26.661 --> 55:29.396
You know where I can locate
this Bill Harden?

55:29.429 --> 55:30.397
It's up near...

55:30.430 --> 55:32.332
I can't remember
the name of the orchard.

55:32.365 --> 55:33.333
It's got a funny name.

55:33.366 --> 55:35.468
Ah, they've all got funny names.

55:35.502 --> 55:38.338
Hey. Buddy.

55:38.371 --> 55:39.807
If you do find Bill...

55:39.841 --> 55:41.309
Word of advice.

55:41.341 --> 55:42.475
He's different.

55:42.510 --> 55:44.411
Keep the talk on the coyotes,
you'll be fine.

55:44.444 --> 55:47.849
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that. Thank you.

56:00.962 --> 56:02.163
Hey, Ben.

56:02.196 --> 56:03.331
Anita is in with a patient.

56:03.363 --> 56:06.834
I just want to say hello to Rex,
see how he's doin'.

56:06.868 --> 56:08.269
That's cool.
You know where he is.

56:08.302 --> 56:09.804
Yeah. Thank you.

56:16.811 --> 56:18.212
Hey.

57:05.693 --> 57:06.794
I'm gonna write down

57:06.827 --> 57:07.929
my daughter Renee's
phone number.

57:07.962 --> 57:11.999
I want you to call her...
have Anita call her...

57:12.033 --> 57:13.901
ask her to come
and pick up the dog.

57:13.935 --> 57:14.936
Okay.

57:17.672 --> 57:18.673
Have a nice day.

58:24.839 --> 58:27.341
You are one ugly old man.

58:30.044 --> 58:31.445
Aidan.

59:22.096 --> 59:23.697
Nice place.

59:23.731 --> 59:25.499
If you say so.

59:28.736 --> 59:30.805
I was surprised
to get your call.

59:32.406 --> 59:34.408
Ben Givens needs help.

59:35.443 --> 59:37.111
Wonders and miracles.

59:45.186 --> 59:46.787
How you doin', Aidan?

59:50.191 --> 59:51.926
I was sorry
to hear about Rachel.

59:54.695 --> 59:56.531
What's it been...
about a year now?

01:00:04.171 --> 01:00:06.774
What she ever saw in you.

01:00:08.476 --> 01:00:10.177
Wasted her good life.

01:00:11.712 --> 01:00:13.147
You think you made her happy?

01:00:15.015 --> 01:00:17.017
She didn't need me to be happy.

01:00:19.521 --> 01:00:20.754
How's Renee?

01:00:20.788 --> 01:00:23.357
I haven't seen her
since high school.

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:25.626
And I hear she has a...

01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:26.794
a son?

01:00:26.827 --> 01:00:27.795
Chris.

01:00:27.828 --> 01:00:29.497
In college.

01:00:32.666 --> 01:00:33.634
Ah, right.

01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:37.171
I think I've asked
all the right questions.

01:00:39.039 --> 01:00:41.408
So why don't you just tell me...
what do you need?

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:44.845
Well, I'm lookin' for
Bill Harden

01:00:44.879 --> 01:00:46.615
and I understand
he lives in the area.

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:48.482
I know him.

01:00:48.517 --> 01:00:49.750
What do you want with him?

01:00:50.985 --> 01:00:52.319
Just want to meet him.

01:00:56.591 --> 01:00:58.159
Rachel sent me a letter
before she passed.

01:00:58.192 --> 01:01:00.728
Did she tell you?

01:01:00.761 --> 01:01:02.129
No.

01:01:02.163 --> 01:01:05.600
I think she knew pretty far out
that this was her time.

01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:09.036
She wanted me and you
to reconnect.

01:01:11.872 --> 01:01:13.874
I said I don't see
a reason for that.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:17.646
There was nothin' between us.

01:01:17.678 --> 01:01:19.213
We just lived different lives.

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:23.984
I got another letter from her.

01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:25.520
Short time later.

01:01:30.024 --> 01:01:31.926
It was a one-word response.

01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:36.697
Horseshit.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:40.768
She could be a real smartass.

01:01:42.537 --> 01:01:43.538
Yeah.

01:01:54.114 --> 01:01:55.584
I'm gonna go see
about some lunch.

01:01:57.718 --> 01:01:59.887
After we eat, I'll take you
to see the old ranch.

01:02:12.266 --> 01:02:13.400
Did you get any birds?

01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:16.303
Yeah, I got a couple.

01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:19.574
Where's your dog?

01:02:19.608 --> 01:02:20.808
You got a dog?

01:02:20.841 --> 01:02:22.977
Mm. Yep.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.411
Where is he?

01:02:24.445 --> 01:02:25.580
He got tore up.

01:02:25.614 --> 01:02:26.947
He's with a vet.

01:02:26.981 --> 01:02:28.650
Uh-huh.

01:02:28.683 --> 01:02:30.784
I still do some huntin'
from time to time.

01:02:33.254 --> 01:02:34.221
When I'm in here,

01:02:34.255 --> 01:02:36.257
all I can think about
is being out there.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.664
But lately, when I'm out there,

01:02:42.697 --> 01:02:46.267
I keep thinking how nice it'd be
to be back in my chair.

01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:49.537
It's getting old, I think.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.441
You still have Dad's gun?

01:02:55.776 --> 01:02:57.378
Why do you think
he gave it to you?

01:02:59.146 --> 01:03:00.180
I don't know.

01:03:00.214 --> 01:03:01.583
He must have wanted you
to have it.

01:03:01.616 --> 01:03:02.584
I mean he had a reason.

01:03:02.617 --> 01:03:03.585
I don't know.

01:03:03.618 --> 01:03:05.352
I... I...

01:03:05.386 --> 01:03:08.389
I just thought it should have
gone to me is all.

01:03:17.031 --> 01:03:18.032
You can't imagine

01:03:18.065 --> 01:03:20.301
what it was like
with Dad at the end.

01:03:20.334 --> 01:03:21.603
I can imagine what it was like.

01:03:21.636 --> 01:03:23.237
No. You can't.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.075
He felt pushed out.

01:03:29.343 --> 01:03:30.911
Especially after
the cabin burned down.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:37.217
The night he died,

01:03:37.251 --> 01:03:39.621
I was holding his head
in my lap...

01:03:39.654 --> 01:03:42.557
trying to calm him down some.

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:45.125
He would sleep shaking,

01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:48.228
and then jerk awake in the dark,

01:03:48.262 --> 01:03:50.264
afraid that
he was going to slip away.

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:53.834
Which he did a few hours later.

01:03:57.204 --> 01:04:01.643
I was with him
when he sold off the land,

01:04:01.676 --> 01:04:02.644
when he was sick.

01:04:02.677 --> 01:04:05.680
I made his meals,
I did his laundry.

01:04:05.714 --> 01:04:06.880
I did everything right.

01:04:09.016 --> 01:04:11.485
And when he was gone...

01:04:11.519 --> 01:04:13.521
what was left of me?

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.992
I wasn't the kind of man
that any woman wanted anymore.

01:04:19.026 --> 01:04:21.995
What did you expect of me?

01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:23.565
I had a practice. I had Renee.

01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:24.599
I...

01:04:24.632 --> 01:04:27.501
couldn't take care of him.

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:30.839
You didn't even come back

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:32.172
to help us
put him in the ground.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:38.212
I was there for him.

01:04:38.245 --> 01:04:39.714
You should have
been there for me.

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.419
<i>Aidan Givens.
Leave a Message.</i>

01:04:47.822 --> 01:04:49.089
<i>Hello, Uncle Aidan.</i>

01:04:49.123 --> 01:04:50.391
<i>This is Renee.</i>

01:04:50.424 --> 01:04:51.559
<i>I'm Ben's daughter.</i>

01:04:51.593 --> 01:04:52.627
<i>I know we haven't seen
each other</i>

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:53.695
<i>in a really long time,</i>

01:04:53.728 --> 01:04:55.195
<i>but I'm looking for my dad.</i>

01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:56.631
<i>He went hunting over there...</i>

01:04:56.664 --> 01:04:58.298
Are you going to get that?

01:04:58.332 --> 01:05:00.401
<i>If you hear from him,
if you see him...</i>

01:05:00.434 --> 01:05:02.302
I've lost my appetite.
Let's go.

01:05:02.336 --> 01:05:03.470
<i>He had a car,</i>

01:05:03.505 --> 01:05:04.539
<i>it was found abandoned
on the old highway,</i>

01:05:04.572 --> 01:05:05.740
<i>and I'm very, very worried
about him.</i>

01:05:05.774 --> 01:05:07.441
<i>If you hear from him,
if you see him...</i>

01:06:36.063 --> 01:06:38.332
The new owners
tore down our old place

01:06:38.365 --> 01:06:40.334
and built a new one there.

01:06:42.035 --> 01:06:43.505
Not so new anymore.

01:06:50.612 --> 01:06:52.346
I have cancer.

01:06:53.848 --> 01:06:56.784
I've got a year
if I don't take treatment.

01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:03.925
Goddamn you.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:06.828
Sayin' something like that.

01:07:06.861 --> 01:07:08.228
Standing where we are.

01:07:09.931 --> 01:07:11.231
Would you even have called

01:07:11.265 --> 01:07:13.968
if you didn't need something
from me?

01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:17.104
No.

01:07:19.574 --> 01:07:21.543
But I'm...

01:07:21.576 --> 01:07:23.210
I'm glad I did.

01:07:23.243 --> 01:07:24.244
Really.

01:07:31.084 --> 01:07:33.220
What do you want from Harden?

01:07:33.253 --> 01:07:35.455
It's a long story.

01:07:35.489 --> 01:07:37.025
It sure as hell
ain't gonna be a short one.

01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:42.797
I mean, you out here
with no wheels, no dog...

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:44.064
dyin' from cancer...

01:07:54.008 --> 01:07:55.442
Harden's place is near here.

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:00.582
Old Palisades Road.

01:08:04.184 --> 01:08:05.820
North Star Ranch.

01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:29.142
You want me to go with you?

01:08:29.176 --> 01:08:31.645
No. I'll go myself.

01:08:34.816 --> 01:08:36.183
This is it?

01:08:39.353 --> 01:08:40.888
This is it.

01:08:43.725 --> 01:08:44.959
Okay.

01:08:50.564 --> 01:08:52.066
Thanks.

01:09:23.831 --> 01:09:25.633
<i>Ben,</i>

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:28.036
<i>do you understand
that I'm leaving?</i>

01:09:30.004 --> 01:09:32.073
<i>It shouldn't be a surprise.</i>

01:09:32.106 --> 01:09:33.941
<i>It's always been my plan.</i>

01:09:36.678 --> 01:09:39.080
<i>Somehow, I thought
maybe you had a plan, too.</i>

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:45.019
I guess I did.

01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:48.622
But it wasn't this.

01:10:18.452 --> 01:10:19.520
Think about

01:10:19.554 --> 01:10:20.755
what you want
from your life, Ben,

01:10:20.788 --> 01:10:22.489
and when you've done that,
let me know.

01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.000
Bill Harden!

01:11:09.971 --> 01:11:11.672
What the hell
are you doin' here?

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.975
I came to get my gun.

01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:15.243
It ain't yours no more,
old man.

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:19.479
The gun has been with my family
for a long time.

01:11:19.514 --> 01:11:21.916
It's not done yet.
And I'm not done with it.

01:11:21.949 --> 01:11:22.917
You better get the hell
out of here

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:24.519
before I lose my temper.

01:11:25.686 --> 01:11:27.955
Do somethin' I'm gonna
have to explain to the sheriff.

01:11:27.989 --> 01:11:29.289
Not without the gun.

01:11:30.825 --> 01:11:32.226
You're tresspassin'.

01:11:36.296 --> 01:11:37.732
Go ahead, do it. Shoot.

01:11:42.335 --> 01:11:43.336
Do it.

01:11:47.175 --> 01:11:48.810
Goddamnit, shoot.
Go on, do it, damn it...

01:11:48.843 --> 01:11:50.144
Get your goddamned hands off!

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.714
You crazy, stupid
son of a bitch.

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:19.073
I see you again,

01:12:19.106 --> 01:12:22.009
I'm going to hurt you
before I kill you.

01:13:39.687 --> 01:13:40.721
<i>Ben.</i>

01:13:40.755 --> 01:13:42.590
Come on.

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:45.826
Come on.

01:14:11.886 --> 01:14:14.055
Do it, Ben.

01:16:11.939 --> 01:16:13.207
I came to get my dog.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.309
Would you be so kind
as to open your clinic?

01:16:16.511 --> 01:16:17.912
Of co...
Get in here!

01:16:17.945 --> 01:16:20.781
God, you have no idea
how happy I am to see you.

01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:23.384
So that number
that you gave me...

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:24.485
I hope you don't mind,

01:16:24.519 --> 01:16:26.521
but I went ahead
and I called it.

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.958
Renee.

01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:31.992
Dad.

01:16:34.962 --> 01:16:36.297
Oh, my God.

01:16:37.298 --> 01:16:39.333
- I was so worried about you.
- Oh, my. Oh, my.

01:16:41.802 --> 01:16:43.737
Oh, I'm so glad
to see you.

01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:45.639
I'm so glad you're here.

01:16:47.308 --> 01:16:49.310
Dad. They said
that Rex got hurt?

01:16:49.343 --> 01:16:50.411
Did you get hurt?

01:16:50.444 --> 01:16:52.379
Rex is fine, I'm fine.

01:16:53.881 --> 01:16:55.249
I love you so much.

01:16:55.282 --> 01:16:57.184
I'm so happy that you're back.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.854
I'm so sorry.

01:16:59.887 --> 01:17:01.055
It's okay.

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:04.325
It's okay.

01:17:22.343 --> 01:17:23.545
That's a good boy.

01:17:34.255 --> 01:17:35.256
Doin' okay?

01:17:37.091 --> 01:17:38.459
Yeah.

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:39.594
You, Dad?

01:17:41.095 --> 01:17:42.830
Yeah.
