What the hell is that?!

09:40.623 --> 09:43.257
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:46.160 --> 09:47.094
[ Engine turns over ]

09:47.129 --> 09:47.629
Honey?

09:47.663 --> 09:48.862
Dad, what are you doing?!

09:48.897 --> 09:50.864
I'm gonna spread a
little Christmas cheer.

09:50.899 --> 09:53.166
All over the [Bleep] desert.

09:53.201 --> 09:53.701
Yaah!

09:57.906 --> 09:59.806
He <i>is</i> real!

09:59.841 --> 10:00.573
[ Gasps ]

10:00.609 --> 10:03.543
I love you, Santa Claus!

10:03.579 --> 10:12.285
It was a feeling that Santa Claus had
long forgotten -- the love of a child.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.888
They didn't need to kidnap the children.

10:14.923 --> 10:17.524
They just needed a place in their hearts.

10:17.559 --> 10:22.929
Ho! Ho! Ho!

10:22.965 --> 10:27.967
The lesson from this tale of woe--
always keep the holidays

10:28.003 --> 10:29.703
alive in your heart.

10:29.738 --> 10:34.308
Or just remember that turkey
riding a motorcycle, because

10:34.343 --> 10:37.277
that was pretty [bleep] cool.
