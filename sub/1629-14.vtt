00:22.773 --> 00:25.389
(BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE)

00:44.295 --> 00:46.126
This is impossible.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.294
This shouldn't be here.

01:01.604 --> 01:02.889
This is all wrong.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.595
EMMA: You're right.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.398
A full-grown princess
still living in her nursery?

01:08.486 --> 01:10.477
I don't even have a proper vanity.

01:10.613 --> 01:12.103
Emma, l...

01:13.491 --> 01:15.277
What are you doing here?

01:16.494 --> 01:18.155
l was looking for a place to practice.

01:18.329 --> 01:19.910
I'm a little nervous about tonight.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.737
Tonight? What's tonight?

01:21.832 --> 01:22.992
The ball.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.999
You know, I've never been to one before.

01:27.338 --> 01:29.249
I don't even know how to dance.

01:30.633 --> 01:31.793
Teach me.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.835
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:44.355 --> 01:46.016
You're a natural. Just like your mother.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.179
(CHUCKLES)

01:48.359 --> 01:52.523
And you are the best teacher
a daughter could hope for.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.528
Oh, Emma.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.201
This is everything I ever hoped for you.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.278
Me, too.

02:02.373 --> 02:03.863
It's a shame I never got it.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.624
What do you mean?

02:07.712 --> 02:09.293
I'm not really here.

02:09.380 --> 02:10.870
l was never here.

02:11.007 --> 02:13.544
I should be, but I'm not.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.010
All for one reason.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.881
You failed me.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.468
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

02:24.770 --> 02:26.226
(THUNDER CRASHING)

02:36.449 --> 02:37.609
Goodbye, Daddy!

02:37.742 --> 02:39.232
Emma, I'm sorry! I'll save you!

02:39.368 --> 02:41.905
No, you can't save me! You failed me!

02:42.038 --> 02:43.073
There's nothing you can do.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.820
No! Emma!

02:44.915 --> 02:46.906
Don't fail the next one.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.369
Emma!

02:52.256 --> 02:55.089
(ECHOING) Don’t fail the next one.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.674

03:05.770 --> 03:07.431
Look who's awake.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.190
(SIGHS)

03:14.779 --> 03:16.690
Come look at this view, Charming.

03:16.781 --> 03:19.113
I'd forgotten how beautiful it was here.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.116
Someone's in a good mood.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.081
lam.

03:29.460 --> 03:32.293
l have some pretty wonderful news.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.629
We're pregnant.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.000
(STAMMERS) You are?

03:39.136 --> 03:41.092
-Are you not happy?
-No.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.636
No, I'm not.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.014
lam thrilled.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.805
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

04:08.666 --> 04:09.906
So now that we know
who we're dealing with,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.331
how do we find this Wicked Witch?

04:11.419 --> 04:12.704
Might I suggest we start by asking

04:12.795 --> 04:13.875
if anyone has seen a woman

04:13.963 --> 04:14.998
with green skin running around?

04:15.089 --> 04:18.502
We're cursed, in Storybrooke. She'll
look like any one of us.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.340
EMMA: Then we start
somewhere we know she's been.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.588
Regina's office.

04:21.679 --> 04:24.261
I went over it with a fine-toothed comb.
She left no trace.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.428
But you were combing for magic.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.756
Maybe there's physical evidence
that you missed.

04:26.851 --> 04:27.931
Good idea. We'll track her.

04:28.018 --> 04:31.101
If you want to waste your time
playing Nancy Drew, be my guest,

04:31.188 --> 04:34.351
but we can't let Henry
wander around alone

04:34.483 --> 04:37.190
with that witch and
her flying monkeys out there.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.025
No. Especially since
one of those flying monkeys

04:39.113 --> 04:40.319
could turn out to be his father.

04:41.699 --> 04:42.734
Still no sign of Neal?

04:42.867 --> 04:43.947
No.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.868
Point being, someone
needs to protect Henry.

04:47.997 --> 04:49.578
He doesn't even know what's going on.

04:49.707 --> 04:50.822
I'm guessing you're volunteering?

04:51.667 --> 04:52.702
If you find anything, call me.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.542
Just remember, he thinks
we're here because I'm on a case.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.127
Well, look who's gotten good at lying.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.296
| just don't want anyone to slip up.

04:59.383 --> 05:02.546
As far as Henry knows,
you're just Madam Mayor, and that's it.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.919
I'm well aware of how Henry sees me.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.053
Time's wasting.

05:10.186 --> 05:11.392
There's something wicked in your town.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.556
What do you say we go and find it?

05:17.693 --> 05:19.900
(CREAKING)

05:28.078 --> 05:29.989
Enjoying your little toy?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.411
(RHYTHMICALLY) Spinning.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.781
Cleans the mind, soothes the soul.

05:33.918 --> 05:36.250
lt cleans the mind, it soothes the soul.

05:36.629 --> 05:37.960
(LAUGHING)

05:38.047 --> 05:39.583
You look as awful as you sound.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.719
What? You're not enjoying your cage,

05:47.056 --> 05:48.091
hmm?

05:49.225 --> 05:51.591
Not appreciating yourjailer?

05:51.727 --> 05:53.433
Oh, no.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.224
You look like you want to hurt me.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.681
Go on then. Give it a go.

05:58.776 --> 05:59.811
(LAUGHS)

05:59.902 --> 06:01.392
I'd love to see you try.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.193
Especially when
we both know that you can't.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.657
Not when l have this.

06:05.783 --> 06:08.775
You're a slave to it and to me.

06:09.453 --> 06:12.945
Frustration can be so intoxicating.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.447
On others.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.746
The only one that can do
the hurting here is me.

06:17.836 --> 06:21.749
So why don't you be a good boy
and sit back down?

06:24.343 --> 06:25.708
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

06:28.138 --> 06:29.264
Well?

06:30.140 --> 06:31.266
What are you waiting for?

06:32.309 --> 06:34.174
Don't let me stop you.

06:38.107 --> 06:40.348
(SINGING) All the voices in my head

06:41.443 --> 06:43.479
Will be quiet when I’m

06:44.321 --> 06:45.356
Dead

06:46.156 --> 06:47.532
(LAUGHS)

06:48.784 --> 06:51.321
I'm not here to kill you, Rumple.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.320
But you really need
to keep up appearances.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.832
Appearances? Appearances?
For what? For why?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.663
Let me spin.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.752
Spin the madness away.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.796
Spin away the madness.

07:04.883 --> 07:05.963
No.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.470
I think the spinning
is bringing the madness.

07:11.557 --> 07:15.141
Here. Come closer.

07:15.686 --> 07:18.553
Now, hold still.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.227
Lest you want me to nick that pretty face.

07:24.653 --> 07:29.067
(CHUCKLES) You're probably
wondering how I know how to do this.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.775
Did I ever tell you about my father?

07:32.870 --> 07:36.829
His hands used to shake from drink.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.746
Or worse.

07:38.876 --> 07:41.959
I didn't ask, he didn't tell me.

07:42.046 --> 07:45.584
But he couldn't abide going
a day without a shave.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.674
So I had to learn how to shave him.

07:50.346 --> 07:54.510
He used to say that no matter
what we were feeling on the inside,

07:55.225 --> 07:57.352
we had to put on our best face.

07:58.729 --> 07:59.844
In our land,

08:00.564 --> 08:03.897
you and I never had that choice, did we?

08:04.068 --> 08:05.899
No matter what we did,

08:07.071 --> 08:10.279
our outsides showed exactly

08:10.407 --> 08:13.194
what was rotting on the inside.

08:17.790 --> 08:21.533
But we're in a new land now, aren't we?

08:21.627 --> 08:24.619
A land filled with opportunity.

08:25.756 --> 08:29.874
Not the least of which is to look our best.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.048
(GASPS)

08:31.762 --> 08:33.548
Oh...

08:33.889 --> 08:36.050
I'm so sorry.

08:36.141 --> 08:39.178
Did that sting? (LAUGHS)

08:41.313 --> 08:42.473
There.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.597
Handsome as ever.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.183
Appearances?

08:48.278 --> 08:50.690
You don't care about appearances.

08:50.781 --> 08:54.148
If you cared about appearances,
you'd change my shirt.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.909
Just exactly what is it you want?

08:57.996 --> 09:01.124
What I'm after, Rumple,

09:01.250 --> 09:04.913
is something
you've spent a lifetime seeking.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.959
Something that goes
against your very nature.

09:08.757 --> 09:12.295
Something that I can't afford

09:13.303 --> 09:15.009
to wait that long for.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.511
(LAUGHS)

09:18.976 --> 09:21.433
Luckily, I won't have to. (LAUGHS)

09:29.903 --> 09:31.234
Uh, hey.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.192
Can I, uh... Can I help you?

09:34.324 --> 09:36.736
Oh, you must be Mrs. Gold.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.443
No. I'm not. (CHUCKLES)

09:39.538 --> 09:41.574

09:41.665 --> 09:43.166
No, he isn't.

He...

09:46.295 --> 09:47.831
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:48.213 --> 09:49.248
He died.

09:49.339 --> 09:52.376
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.885
Oh. Belle.

09:53.969 --> 09:54.958
Belle.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.548

09:58.182 --> 09:59.672
Look,

09:59.808 --> 10:02.185
I'm so sorry to bother you,

10:02.311 --> 10:03.892
but I was hoping to buy a baby gift

10:04.021 --> 10:06.512
for a lovely woman
I met at Granny's Diner.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.065
Maybe you know her.
She goes by Mary Margaret here.

10:10.194 --> 10:13.357
See, I'm helping her with her pregnancy,

10:13.489 --> 10:16.481
and today is my first day
on the job, you know.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.362
Curse or no curse, a girl's got to work.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.863

10:20.996 --> 10:22.406
Mary Margaret?

10:22.539 --> 10:26.748
Well, why didn't you say so?
I think I may have just the thing.

10:26.877 --> 10:27.866
Bless you.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.872
(CHUCKLES) Just a second.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.847
I think I have a partial footprint.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.550

11:26.645 --> 11:29.136
Other than an austere
sense of design, nothing.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.770
Is that blood?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.727
(SNIFFS) It's berry.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.316
Like a fruit?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.906
No, like a holly berry.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.028
They grow on bushes.

11:42.119 --> 11:45.236
Are you some sort of botanist
in this life, mate?

11:45.330 --> 11:48.288
I worked in an animal shelter.
Saw dogs track them all the time.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.658
The bushes grow out in the woods.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.250
You know where?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.293
Yeah, in the northwest corner,
not far from the toll bridge.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.594
Bit demanding, isn't she?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.150
I meant the midwife.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.441
It's fine. Go.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.939
We just got on track here.

Just feels wrong somehow.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.828
That's very generous.
The Queen must like you.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.201
No, I simply think she wants me

14:04.261 --> 14:06.627
That's just it. I don't know.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.755
| just can't seem to escape this feeling

14:10.892 --> 14:11.927
of dread.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.185
And I really need to be
there for Snow right now.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.558
And I can't be distracted by this...

14:20.318 --> 14:21.444
This fear.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.272
So don't be.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.736
Easier said than done.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.324
After my wife died,

14:29.453 --> 14:32.661
Friar Tuck told me of a root that,
if digested,

14:32.789 --> 14:35.576
would help one overcome
any and all fears.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.663
Where do I find it?

14:40.255 --> 14:41.370
It's said to grow under the white moss

14:41.506 --> 14:42.621
at the edge of ShenNood Forest,

14:42.799 --> 14:44.084
just south of here.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.294
White moss. Anything else?

14:45.427 --> 14:49.386
It has flecks of crystal
within its flesh that look like stars.

14:49.473 --> 14:50.633
Stars?

14:50.766 --> 14:52.427
That's why they call it Night Root.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.768
Did it help you?

14:53.935 --> 14:56.312
I don't really dabble in magic.
Not unless I have to.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.269
Well, I may not have that luxury.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.688
Then you should know, they say that

15:00.817 --> 15:03.103
that part of the forest is haunted.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.230
Haunted?

15:04.321 --> 15:05.356
You might need the Night Root

15:05.489 --> 15:08.526
to handle the fear of yourjourney
to stop your fear.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.114
Perhaps the flask was the right idea.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.158
I'm not afraid of a ghost story.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.323
Not when my family's at stake.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.445
Thank you.

15:19.878 --> 15:23.587
(LAUGHING) No.
He caught you in a net?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.834
Well, I had just robbed his carriage.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.379
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.
You two have got quite a love story.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.592
Well...

15:29.679 --> 15:31.465
Well, speak of the handsome devil.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.092
Zelena, this is David.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.139
Mr. Nolan. It's so lovely to meet you.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.518
(SIGHS) Okay. So, I'm here.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.680
Shall we get this started?

15:42.234 --> 15:45.101
Oh. Sounds like you mean,
"Shall we get this finished?"

15:45.195 --> 15:48.858
No. No. lam here. (SIGHS) Let's do this.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.405
Before we begin,
I'm gonna get us a cup of tea.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.072
No, no, no. Let me make you some tea.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.035
After all, that's what I'm here for.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.833
To make your life as easy as possible.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.532

16:03.839 --> 16:05.921
(QUIETLY) I mean, isn't she wonderful?

16:06.049 --> 16:07.835
(QUIETLY) Yeah, she seems perfect.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.666
But can we trust her?
We don't even know her.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.257
It's entirely possible
we were all friends in our missing year.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.551
And it's possible we weren't.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.386
(KETTLE WHISTLING)

16:17.519 --> 16:19.350
Look, ljust wish
we knew more about her.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.520
It's not like we can ask for references
from a missing year.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.722
(WHISTLING STOPS)

16:24.860 --> 16:27.192

16:28.572 --> 16:29.652
Yes.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.900
They were friends.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.948
(SlGHlNG) Huh. Small world.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.034
David,

16:37.372 --> 16:40.114
if any part of this feels wrong to you,
to either one of us,

16:40.250 --> 16:42.582
we can always change our minds.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.793
Let's just hear her out, right?

16:47.591 --> 16:48.922
Mmm.

16:57.809 --> 16:58.969
Here we go.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.976
I hope chamomile is okay.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.437
I've found it's excellent for the nerves.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.931
Perfect.

in such a long time.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.445
How long have you been up here?

19:25.582 --> 19:27.197
I've lost count of the years.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.245
Are you a prince?

19:31.755 --> 19:32.790
Yes.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.918
You can call me David.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.837
Your tiara.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.429
Are you a princess?

19:40.555 --> 19:41.635
Yes.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.430
But you can call me Rapunzel.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.220
My parents are
the king and queen of my realm.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.681
They're great leaders,
adored by our people.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.312
Why did you leave your kingdom?

19:55.653 --> 19:58.395
For the same reason you did.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.696
I saw what you were digging up.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.364
You came for the Night Root?

20:01.451 --> 20:02.566
Yes.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.612
When I got older, I knew.

20:06.748 --> 20:09.581
ljust knew I could never
be a leader like my parents.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.749
But at least I had my older brother.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.952
He was next in line.

20:14.089 --> 20:17.297
But then something happened.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.086
Something horrible.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.508
I'm sorry.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.252
It was a terrible, terrible accident.

20:22.347 --> 20:27.592
And after his death,
this fear started to ovenNhelm me.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.425
When I closed my eyes...

20:29.521 --> 20:31.477
Then the nightmares would come.

20:31.606 --> 20:32.971
They crippled my sleep.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.473
Did you take the Night Root?

20:34.609 --> 20:36.224
Yes.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.230
It didn't work.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.279
Coming to get it
was the greatest mistake of my life.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.986
Then how are you still here?

20:44.119 --> 20:46.155
Before I could return home,

20:46.329 --> 20:47.830
a witch appeared.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.321
Her face hidden under a cloak.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.782
She attacked me
and chased me into this tower.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.997
Well, you don't have
to worry about her anymore.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.166
I'm getting you out of here.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.163
You don't understand. She won't let me.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.339
Whenever I try to leave, she...

21:15.358 --> 21:16.723
It's too late.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.529
She must know you're here.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.868
Now, you've already gone
through labor once,

21:33.001 --> 21:34.537
so at least you know what to expect.

21:34.669 --> 21:35.829
Oh, yes, we both do.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.000
I don't think that your hand has

21:37.130 --> 21:38.165
recovered from my squeezing it.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.212
Well, it's been almost 30
years. I'm sure it'll heal.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.885
Well, keep in mind, the second birth

21:43.052 --> 21:44.462
can progress much faster than the first.

21:44.554 --> 21:45.794
Well, that's putting it mildly.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.629
I seem to have gone
from zero to due date

21:47.724 --> 21:49.555
in the blink of an eye.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.555
How's our father doing?

21:55.565 --> 21:58.432
Oh, me? I'm fine. Great. (CHUCKLES)

21:59.402 --> 22:01.859
Well, Mary Margaret
was telling me earlier

22:02.030 --> 22:03.566
about what happened in the first curse.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.908
And losing your daughter is tragic.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.698
Look, I don't mean to pry,

22:11.789 --> 22:15.532
but she did express some anxiety
about all of this.

22:16.377 --> 22:17.628
You did?

22:19.547 --> 22:22.630
David, we're missing a year of memories
in the enchanted forest.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.797
We suddenly find ourselves
in Storybrooke about to have a baby.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.262
It's a bit disconcerting.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.097
I think it's best to
just get these anxieties out in the open.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.969
Feelings, especially
those we keep bottled up,

22:36.105 --> 22:39.689
can effect a pregnancy
just as much as diet and exercise.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.939
Look, I suppose what
I'm trying to say is that,

22:43.071 --> 22:46.154
if you've got any fears
at all about any of this,

22:46.282 --> 22:48.659
it's best to just get it out into the open.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.616
I don't. (SIGHS)

Speaking of which,
Mary Margaret alluded

23:15.186 --> 23:18.223
that we pulled you away
from some important town business.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.929
I think we've done enough for today.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.647
We should just let you get back to it.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.686

to meet you, Mr. Nolan.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.484

meet you, too, Zelena.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.904
My mom used to
take me for gelato in Little Italy.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.660
But this is just as good.

24:21.210 --> 24:24.338
Well, Storybrooke's got its own charms.

24:24.505 --> 24:28.839
Though I know it must seem
quaint compared to the big city.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.712
It's nice, actually.

24:31.846 --> 24:32.881
New York's great,

24:32.972 --> 24:35.133
but there are so many people
that it can make you feel...

24:35.725 --> 24:37.181
Alone?

24:37.268 --> 24:38.724
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.309
Yeah.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.980
That's the best part of a small town.
Everybody knows everybody.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.227
It's like...

24:46.736 --> 24:48.226
It's like a big family.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.070
Can I tell you something?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.280
Sure.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.910
I don't think it was just the case

24:55.036 --> 24:56.572
that brought my mom to Storybrooke.

24:56.746 --> 24:58.361
Uh, what do you mean?

24:59.707 --> 25:02.414
I think she wanted
to get out of New York for a while.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.202
Well, why do you think that?

25:06.297 --> 25:07.912
My mom's boyfriend.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.298
His name was Walsh.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.927
He proposed to her.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.463
Oh.

25:14.055 --> 25:15.886
And two days later,
she's taking me out of school

25:15.973 --> 25:17.929
for some job in Maine.

25:18.059 --> 25:21.972
She wouldn't take a job in Queens
if it meant l'd miss school.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.436
What do you think happened?

25:24.148 --> 25:26.355
I don't know.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.398
But I doubt we'd be here if she said yes.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.774
How do you feel about it?

25:35.785 --> 25:36.820
this Walsh?

25:36.994 --> 25:39.076
I liked how happy he made her.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.448
Plus, it might be nice

25:40.581 --> 25:43.118
having more than
two place settings during the holidays.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.284
I think one day you'll have more family

25:46.462 --> 25:47.838
than you'll know what to do with.

25:48.798 --> 25:49.833
You think so?

25:50.842 --> 25:51.957
I really do.

25:57.807 --> 26:00.048
You'll look for any excuse
to use that thing, won't you?

26:00.143 --> 26:02.304
At least we know
we're in the right place. What now?

26:02.437 --> 26:05.349
Now we start searching.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.596
KlLLlAN: You know something, Swan?

26:06.691 --> 26:08.477
Whenever you're around,
I inevitably find myself

26:08.609 --> 26:13.069
trekking through some manner of woods
or forest courting danger.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.612
Ah. Here I thought
you weren't afraid of anything.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.530
Always looking for the next adventure.

26:16.659 --> 26:17.648
Oh, is that what this is?

26:17.744 --> 26:18.733
Isn't it?

26:18.828 --> 26:21.740
What the hell were you doing for
the last year alone on that ship?

26:21.831 --> 26:24.618
I'm guessing it was
one swashbuckling tale after another.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.659
Until you decided
to come back and save me.

26:28.463 --> 26:29.794
Exactly.

26:31.716 --> 26:32.751
You're lying.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.252
Excuse me?

26:34.343 --> 26:36.208
What happened back there?
What aren't you telling me?

26:36.345 --> 26:38.506
Nothing. That's my tale,
and I'm sticking to it.

26:38.639 --> 26:39.674
Still don't believe you.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.344
Well, let's leave it at that and
you can just say, "Thank you."

26:42.477 --> 26:44.013
For my memories? I already did.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.052
For saving you from a loveless marriage.

26:46.189 --> 26:48.054
Is that what you think you're doing?

26:48.191 --> 26:49.476
He was a flying monkey.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.023
I didn't know that.

26:52.987 --> 26:56.070
Were you considering it? His proposal?

26:56.199 --> 26:57.279
Does it matter?

26:57.366 --> 26:58.355

26:58.493 --> 27:00.199
Yes. Okay?

27:00.328 --> 27:02.284
lwas in love.
So, of course, lwas considering it.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.907
But, as usual, he wasn't who he said

27:04.040 --> 27:05.576
he was, and I got my heart broken.

27:05.708 --> 27:06.823
That enough humor for you?

27:08.753 --> 27:11.165
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm glad to hear that.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.712
You're glad to hear
I had my heart broken?

27:14.675 --> 27:17.337
If it can be broken,

27:17.428 --> 27:19.384
it means it still works.

28:51.314 --> 28:54.772
I'm at the trail ahead and I think
I found her. The Wicked Witch.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.019
I'm going after her.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.124
I should never have called to you.
I'm the one she wants.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.917
If you leave now,
maybe she'll spare you.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.165
No, that's not the way this works.

29:17.298 --> 29:18.378
I'm getting you back to your family.

29:18.507 --> 29:19.667
Please. She'll kill you!

29:19.800 --> 29:22.883
You can't save me.
There's nothing you can do.

30:51.559 --> 30:53.675
Then why are we whispering?

30:53.769 --> 30:55.270
Because good hideouts
always look empty.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.262
Trust me.

30:58.399 --> 30:59.730
I spent a lot of time tracking down

30:59.859 --> 31:01.190
people who don't want to be found.

31:47.198 --> 31:49.154
If this witch is as powerful as we think,

31:49.325 --> 31:51.236
we could use some magical backup.

I'd like to see those flying monstrosities
try to get past her crossbow.

You can't defeat me.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.707

40:06.989 --> 40:09.025

40:09.658 --> 40:13.697
That's the strange part.
After I killed it, the hilt, it disappeared.
