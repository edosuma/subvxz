EDEN APARTMENTS

03:44.766 --> 03:46.309
Did you just move in?

03:51.856 --> 03:53.024
Hi, how are you?

03:53.524 --> 03:56.402
Oh. Finally, you're here now.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.154
You sure took your time.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.034
Anyway, welcome.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.329
This flower here is known as
the Devil's Trumpet.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.456
That one there is called
the Angel's Trumpet

04:08.539 --> 04:10.959
'cause it looks like
a horn facing the ground.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.752
That one is the Devil's Trumpet

04:12.835 --> 04:15.296
because it looks like
a horn playing into the sky.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.591
Apparently, God thought
they were cocky for looking up.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.679
Maybe that's the reason
why you can only smell them at nighttime.

04:24.514 --> 04:28.059
You need to shatter these kinds of pots
before you can toss them.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.668
<i>My dear Yeon-jin…</i>

04:53.751 --> 04:54.794
TO YEON-JIN

04:54.877 --> 04:56.296
<i>Do you remember</i>

04:57.213 --> 05:00.133
<i>that I used to hate the summer?</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:05.805
<i>Thankfully, I moved away</i>
<i>before it got even hotter.</i>

05:06.931 --> 05:08.641
<i>I've been organizing these photos,</i>

05:09.642 --> 05:13.313
<i>but it's taking so long</i>
<i>because of all these friendly faces.</i>

05:13.396 --> 05:14.772
WEATHERCASTER PARK YEON-JIN

05:14.856 --> 05:17.150
<i>And every time I start going through them,</i>

05:17.233 --> 05:20.069
<i>I picture you opening that door.</i>

05:26.367 --> 05:27.201
Wow.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.205
What are you doing?

05:31.873 --> 05:35.126
That's Jae-jun… Sa-ra… Photos of everyone…

05:36.544 --> 05:37.462
So then,

05:38.880 --> 05:39.714
who are you?

05:43.509 --> 05:45.511
It's me, Yeon-jin. Me.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.891
You really haven't changed at all, huh?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.935
You still have no manners, do you?

05:53.019 --> 05:56.189
You should take your shoes off
when you enter somebody's home.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.991
Now, I have
yet another reason to kill you.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.951
You should at least recognize who I am.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.915
Kill me? You think you could kill me?

06:13.998 --> 06:14.999
Yeah, I know so.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.503
I know I'm going to do my best
to try and kill you.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.172
So go and get ready, Yeon-jin.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.216
I'm already here for you.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.760
Ah.

06:27.011 --> 06:30.098
Do you want to hear the whole story

06:30.181 --> 06:34.143
and how… I got here?

06:36.979 --> 06:37.814
CHIEF SHIN YEONG-JUN

06:37.897 --> 06:39.524
Since an official report has been filed,

06:39.607 --> 06:41.734
we'll have to follow procedure
and call their guardians.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.821
But don't worry,
I'll make sure she gets off easy.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.239
SUMMER OF 2004

06:46.322 --> 06:47.365
I'll call you later.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.451
Park Yeon-jin…

06:52.870 --> 06:54.622
-Yeah?
-Why were you bullying your friend?

06:54.705 --> 06:56.374
I don't want you here for that again.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.544
-Your mother's been told. Get going.
-But she's not my friend.

06:59.627 --> 07:03.464
By the way, sir,
what's going on between you and my mother?

07:04.549 --> 07:05.675
We're friends from childhood.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.845
Oh, you're like Son Myeong-o?

07:08.928 --> 07:11.431
So that's why you've been
so helpful with her divorce.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.225
You're the one who proved
my dad was having an affair.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.437
I was wrong.
I was thinking you slept with her.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.068
Get up!

07:24.610 --> 07:26.863
All the deliveries are
gonna be backed up. Go!

07:26.946 --> 07:29.198
Come on. I told you not to come, asshole.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.368
All you two need to do is
just hug and say sorry.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.828
Come on, Sa-ra. Let's go.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.541
…mentioned a car?

07:44.755 --> 07:46.007
How can I help you, sir?

07:46.090 --> 07:48.718
I'm acting as her legal guardian.
I'm her teacher.

07:52.930 --> 07:53.764
Hey.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.267
What the hell are you doing
at the police station?

07:56.350 --> 07:59.103
You thought it was a good idea to call
the police over some small prank?

07:59.187 --> 08:00.730
The vice principal found out--

08:03.441 --> 08:05.610
We'll talk later. Come on. Let's go.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.195
Sir, help me too.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.654
I'm an orphan this week

08:09.864 --> 08:12.825
'cause my parents are abroad… golfing.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.910
Really?

08:14.785 --> 08:17.121
You should have called me
as soon as you could.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.789
I'll take him, too.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.124
Oh, yeah. Sure.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.711
I was wondering,
why are you still here?

08:23.794 --> 08:25.421
Wait. Who's making your meals?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.924
-Our housekeeper.
-Oh, of course.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.182
Didn't I say today was important?

08:36.265 --> 08:38.768
I am so disappointed by what you did.

08:40.353 --> 08:44.273
-I didn't know I'd get in trouble.
-And that's why I'm disappointed.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.609
You couldn't handle someone so low.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.740
Didn't I say
that you can only hang out with Jae-jun?

08:52.823 --> 08:53.950
If you're bored, Sa-ra too.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.494
Did you forget?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.331
The shaman said you'd get bad luck
from people with Os in their name.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.918
Son Myeong-o. Choi Hye-jeong.
I'm talking about those kids now!

09:04.919 --> 09:06.754
Inside. We're running late.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.180
MOON DONG-EUN
SUNGHAN HIGH SCHOOL

10:06.689 --> 10:08.024
Dong-eun's here!

10:08.107 --> 10:10.067
The one that you get to see every day.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.532
Welcome!

10:20.411 --> 10:22.663
I wanted to apologize
for bullying you.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.750
I'm sorry. We even now?

10:27.793 --> 10:31.172
There was no need to call the cops on us,
was there? We got scared.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.176
Speaking of which, Dong-eun…

10:37.178 --> 10:38.429
from this moment on,

10:39.597 --> 10:41.182
you'll check if my iron is hot enough.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.937
Please don't! No!

10:47.605 --> 10:49.607
They'll arrest you! Let go! Stop!

10:49.690 --> 10:53.069
Hey, now, what's the crime
in asking for a little favor?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.862
You're making us feel weird.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.281
Come on, check if it's hot or not.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.532
Come on.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.288
Is it hot enough?

11:06.999 --> 11:08.292
Seems to be good.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.044
Try it now.

11:12.171 --> 11:16.509
Somebody help me!
Somebody please come and save me!

11:17.301 --> 11:19.303
You're just wasting your time.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.514
Scream as loud as you can. No one'll come.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.349
Nobody will save you.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.520
The gym teacher even gave us the key!

11:27.603 --> 11:28.437
GYM

11:35.236 --> 11:36.862
Why are you doing this?

11:37.988 --> 11:40.241
Why are you doing this to me? Please!

11:40.950 --> 11:42.535
I'm so sick of that.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.955
Why do you people always ask that?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.041
I do it because nothing
will ever happen to me,

11:49.125 --> 11:50.793
and nothing will change no matter what.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.503
Take now, for example.

11:52.586 --> 11:55.965
You raised such a fuss with the police,
but look where you are right now.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.300
Did anything change?

11:59.051 --> 12:02.012
What I'm trying to say is that
no one's going to save you.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.307
Not the cops, not the school,
not even your parents.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.935
Know what they call a person like that?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.563
They're called a loser.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.568
Did I hear you really live at a motel?

12:15.651 --> 12:18.362
I thought that you never
really had a home, no?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.656
It's like something out of a fairy tale.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.784
Guess you're living
in a fairy-tale, Dong-eun.

12:23.868 --> 12:27.288
Wow, I guess that makes her
my fairy godmother, then.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.040
Since she helped me check my iron.
Didn't she?

12:33.711 --> 12:35.379
Please, no!

12:35.463 --> 12:36.714
Let go!

12:37.381 --> 12:39.592
-No!
-Shut her up, will you Myeong-o?

12:39.675 --> 12:40.760
No!

12:42.511 --> 12:44.930
Hey, try and use your inside voice, okay?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.289
Hydrogen peroxide?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.334
I spilled something on my shirt.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.836
If I can have some, I'll clean it up.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.588
What'd you get on your shirt?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.674
So you're… bleeding?

13:24.053 --> 13:26.138
Just let me have some hydrogen peroxide.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.437
How did this happen? Who did this to you?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.898
Did you tell your homeroom teacher?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.109
I've seen something like this before.

13:39.610 --> 13:43.197
If you can't do it alone, I'll go with you
and tell your teacher. Okay?

13:43.697 --> 13:44.865
Who did it?

13:59.296 --> 14:00.506
Oh, hey, Mom.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.175
Can I call you back soon?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.138
I did.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.684
Last time was me as well.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.487
<i>Did you know, Yeon-jin…</i>

14:26.490 --> 14:30.911
<i>that your daughter likes</i>
<i>to look at the world upside-down?</i>

14:33.080 --> 14:35.416
<i>Maybe people can still understand</i>

14:36.125 --> 14:37.793
<i>because in some way,</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:39.670
<i>the whole world is always upside-down.</i>

14:45.467 --> 14:48.888
Those look like
the same shoes my mom wears.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.105
So, you're her.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.317
Park Yeon-jin's daughter. Ha Ye-sol.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.485
Do you know who my mom is?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.947
I think about your mom every single day.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.535
There's a type of hatred
that's similar to longing.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.746
It's impossible to stop.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.749
Don't know hatred.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.500
What's it mean?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.342
You wanna know what hatred is?

15:58.540 --> 16:00.125
That's so fucking funny.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.512
Huh.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.013
Hey.

16:14.014 --> 16:14.848
Leaving?

16:33.117 --> 16:36.203
<i>Her eyes would darken</i>
<i>when she was having fun.</i>

16:36.286 --> 16:37.955
What took you so long?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.333
I really missed you.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.544
<i>Her lips curled up</i>
<i>when she smiled.</i>

16:44.044 --> 16:46.505
<i>All that dark, beautiful hair.</i>

16:47.631 --> 16:48.966
<i>If you put that together,</i>

16:50.009 --> 16:51.760
<i>that's what hatred looks like.</i>

16:56.223 --> 16:58.892
No fucking way!
She took her shoes off.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.645
Oh, we're so shitty. Shame on us.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.147
Move over.

17:04.148 --> 17:04.982
Hey!

17:05.566 --> 17:06.483
This your piggy bank?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.819
I found this in your rice cooker.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.780
-I just couldn't believe it.
-Give it to me.

17:13.991 --> 17:14.992
Oh, no.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.369
Are you mad at me?

17:18.328 --> 17:19.621
Nice catch, huh?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.957
Wow. There's a ton in here.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.335
Ooh, that's it? So sad.

17:25.419 --> 17:30.007
Dong-eun, you have such a terrible life.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.385
What's that crazy bitch on now?
Pan Cold or glue?

17:33.469 --> 17:35.220
No!

17:35.304 --> 17:38.348
Stop! No! No!

17:39.767 --> 17:42.686
She's got so much dough!
This is like 200,000 won.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.354
Guess she's paying for all this?

17:44.438 --> 17:48.275
You guys all have money!
You guys don't need any of mine!

17:50.694 --> 17:52.946
Please, I'm begging you. Give it back.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.575
Hmm. Seems like
you've learned to behave, Dong-eun.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.659
Fine.

17:59.703 --> 18:00.704
I'll give it back.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.209
But you'll need to dance for us
while we drink.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.878
Then I won't touch any of it. Sound good?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.422
-What?
-Go and dance for us.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.051
How are we supposed to have fun
if no one's dancing?

18:15.135 --> 18:17.304
Don't you want it?

18:19.723 --> 18:22.643
Well, if you won't do that,
there's another way to get it.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.104
I found this in your house.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.817
You seem like a bit of a mess right now.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.694
And if you act like
you're better than this,

18:33.529 --> 18:36.990
you're going to have
a really, really big mess. Huh?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.535
So dance for me.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.204
Have some fun.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.917
It's fine if you don't want to.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.589
Hey, I've never noticed, but Dong-eun…

18:56.677 --> 18:57.761
your legs are pretty.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.856
I'll pick out the first song!

19:09.356 --> 19:11.692
I have a ton that are so fucking good.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.634
HEALTH OFFICE

19:43.390 --> 19:46.310
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
DUE TO RESIGNATION OF THE SCHOOL NURSE

22:28.305 --> 22:30.223
For real? When though?

22:32.184 --> 22:33.477
I'll call you back later.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.315
Hey… Dong-eun dropped out.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.443
And she listed us
as the reason for her transfer.

22:41.943 --> 22:43.278
She gave it to the vice principal,

22:43.362 --> 22:45.614
and now he's chewing out
our homeroom teacher.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.992
Not the gym teacher?

22:49.076 --> 22:52.162
She list us in order?

22:53.121 --> 22:55.165
I wonder where my name is on that list.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.751
Are you stupid or something?

23:01.838 --> 23:04.174
Hey! Jae-jun! Yeon-jin!

23:04.841 --> 23:05.842
Get over here!

23:13.600 --> 23:14.810
<i>You stupid fucking bitch!</i>

23:15.811 --> 23:17.813
<i>You should've just quietly dropped out.</i>

23:17.896 --> 23:20.482
<i>So you're innocent?</i>
<i>You didn't do anything wrong?</i>

23:20.565 --> 23:23.110
<i>Only someone this messed up</i>
<i>would push it this far!</i>

23:23.193 --> 23:25.404
<i>Come back and correct your reason,</i>
<i>right now!</i>

23:33.286 --> 23:36.039
DROPOUT FORM

23:36.123 --> 23:37.958
If the principal finds out,

23:38.041 --> 23:40.460
it might affect
your performance review, Mr. Kim.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.296
I know that. Jesus.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.381
Okay?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.432
What's this about?

23:55.142 --> 23:57.144
What kind of reason are you putting?

23:58.061 --> 23:59.855
It's in-school violence.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.108
By Park Yeon-jin, Lee Sa-ra,
Choi Hye-jeong, and Son Myeong-o.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.737
And you just stood there,
watching it happen.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.239
You shut that lying mouth of yours.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.324
Did they break an or a leg?

24:11.825 --> 24:13.869
You're walking around fine
with nothing broken.

24:13.952 --> 24:17.247
So what bullying is it?
What did I do wrong, huh?

24:17.747 --> 24:19.541
At this point, you're delusional.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.586
Once in a while,
friends hit each other too, no?

24:22.669 --> 24:23.628
Why…

24:25.630 --> 24:26.965
are you okay with that?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.634
What?

24:29.718 --> 24:32.762
You were so proud
that your son got into university.

24:35.223 --> 24:38.643
Would it be fine if your son's friends
hit him as hard as they could?

24:41.229 --> 24:44.107
I've been trying to go easy on you.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.194
But now you're asking for it.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.237
I can't believe you.

24:50.864 --> 24:51.948
What'd you say

24:53.825 --> 24:54.826
about…

24:56.077 --> 24:57.078
my son?

24:57.162 --> 24:59.706
Say it again! What?

24:59.789 --> 25:01.166
-Say it!
-Stop! That's enough.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.668
Say it.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.880
-What'd you say? Get up! Say it again!
-Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim!

25:06.963 --> 25:08.423
-I dare you.
-It's not worth it.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.133
Come on! Get up!

25:10.675 --> 25:12.302
I dare you to say it again.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.472
-Say it! Come on!
-Mr. Kim!

25:15.555 --> 25:18.141

25:20.393 --> 25:22.479
Ms. Jeong, phone's ringing.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.564
Yeah, coming!

25:25.482 --> 25:27.734
-Oh, hey! Watch it.
-What's wrong?

25:28.443 --> 25:29.945
Just wait a sec.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.577
Hi, who is this?

25:39.746 --> 25:40.747
Yeah.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.501
I'm her mom. Yeah.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.712
Who is this?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.560
Go ahead, open it. It's quite all right.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.940
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

26:08.024 --> 26:08.858

26:09.985 --> 26:13.405

26:13.488 --> 26:15.574
Ah, technically, I'm not.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.159
But I… I'm sort of like her father--

26:18.660 --> 26:21.329
Then… you can sign it.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.456
-Ah.
-Yeah.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.666

26:24.749 --> 26:28.169
As you know,
certain things need to be on file.

26:29.212 --> 26:32.340
I don't… have a signature.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.217
Can I just write my name?

26:34.301 --> 26:35.385
Of course, you can.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.803
VICTIM : JEONG MI-HEE

26:36.886 --> 26:39.889
Just write your name there,
and then write one more thing for us.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.975
-Write what?
-It's just… It's real short.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.935
"Maladjustment."

27:00.660 --> 27:01.911
Honey, forget something?

27:02.996 --> 27:05.498
You… didn't know she left?

27:06.499 --> 27:08.793
Your mother checked out of here
this morning.

27:09.544 --> 27:12.547
Oh, Jesus Christ. Your school uniform.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.592
I'm sure she'll call you.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.427
She's your mother.

<i>My scars were itching,</i>

29:05.410 --> 29:08.079
<i>and I was in so much pain</i>
<i>from my period cramps.</i>

29:09.789 --> 29:11.166
<i>So I thought,</i>

29:13.334 --> 29:15.211
<i>"The pharmacy opens at 9:00 a.m.,</i>

29:16.087 --> 29:18.381
<i>and the Han River is</i>
<i>just 20 minutes away."</i>

29:19.591 --> 29:21.092
<i>"The water will be freezing,</i>

29:22.135 --> 29:24.304
<i>but then it'll pass."</i>

29:24.929 --> 29:26.806
<i>"My scars won't itch anymore."</i>

29:28.224 --> 29:29.559
<i>"What more can I want?"</i>

29:31.186 --> 29:32.812
<i>"This is the right thing to do."</i>

30:34.791 --> 30:36.459
Is Dong-eun pretty?

30:37.377 --> 30:38.711
I mean, what do you think?

30:38.795 --> 30:40.171
From a guy's view point?

30:42.215 --> 30:43.132
I don't know.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.634
Don't play dumb.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.514
I mean, her face isn't
the only thing that's pretty.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.225
Maybe you should've just
kept your mouth shut.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.518
Ugh. Get off me.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.064
Where are you going?
Getting more drinks?

30:58.648 --> 30:59.774
Hye-jeong'll do it.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.610
She would've asked me already.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.029
I've gotta go to an early service.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.491
Ugh, my dad threatened
to destroy my studio if I didn't show up.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.911
He wanted me to bring you guys,
since it's for college exams,

31:11.995 --> 31:12.954
but I said no.

31:13.037 --> 31:16.040
Hey, wanna make sure I'm never invited?

31:16.541 --> 31:18.167
Got any white shirts?

31:18.251 --> 31:19.669
Amen!

31:21.337 --> 31:23.423
Jesus Christ once said,

31:24.507 --> 31:27.093
"If someone slaps your right cheek,

31:27.176 --> 31:29.846
you should let them
slap the left one, too."

31:29.929 --> 31:30.847
Amen!

31:30.930 --> 31:32.849
And if someone takes your shirt,

31:32.932 --> 31:34.809
you should give them your jacket as well.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.269
Amen!

31:36.352 --> 31:38.730
And if someone
makes you walk five kilometers,

31:38.813 --> 31:40.690
then you go walk ten kilometers.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.191
Amen! Amen!

31:42.275 --> 31:44.652
-We believe in Jesus Christ.
-Amen! Amen!

31:46.029 --> 31:47.780
Sa-ra's dad's voice cracked.
It was so funny.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.699
You should've seen him.

31:49.782 --> 31:52.035
Maybe he was just shocked
by your small titties, you know?.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.915
-Get me chocolate milk.
-Huh?

31:59.918 --> 32:00.752
Sure.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.297
-Anyone else?
-Hye-jeong!

32:05.089 --> 32:06.758
I told you, I'm fasting.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.927
Shit.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.639
Hey, Gyeong-ran,

32:12.722 --> 32:14.599
You gonna keep crying all night long?

32:14.682 --> 32:17.060
Stop. Stop crying, you whore.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.896
Fuck, you're so goddamn loud.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.609
Shh, Gyeong-ran.

32:24.692 --> 32:25.985
If you scream again…

32:26.569 --> 32:27.445
Huh?

32:34.869 --> 32:35.703
Dong-eun?

32:56.140 --> 32:59.185
Is she crazy? She came here on her own?

33:03.856 --> 33:06.609
Wow, Dong-eun…

33:08.361 --> 33:10.196
I've really missed you.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.782
You dropped out without saying goodbye.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.786
Your dream that you wrote,
on your Cyworld.

33:16.869 --> 33:20.039
A wise mother and a wife.
That's really your dream?

33:20.123 --> 33:23.209
Seriously? Did you really write that?

33:25.503 --> 33:28.756
You shit. Why are you
bringing this up out of nowhere?

33:29.257 --> 33:30.800
Sa-ra wants to paint.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.677
Jae-jun wants to inherit the golf course.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.554
Hye-jeong wants to be a stewardess.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.682
And you want to be a wise mother and wife?

33:38.558 --> 33:40.518
Hey, what the fuck?

33:40.601 --> 33:42.395
Forget me? Huh?

33:42.478 --> 33:45.064
I have a dream, too.
I'm going to be filthy rich.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.442
A dream? No, I don't need that.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.529
Having a dream is
just for people like… like you,

33:52.530 --> 33:54.323
or him, or her.

33:54.824 --> 33:58.494
With my money, I can pay you
to make my dream job come true.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.622
I don't need a dream. I need nothing.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.875
Maybe a job that's not too shabby.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.087
Um, I'll just get married
while I'm still young and pretty.

34:08.171 --> 34:11.841
I'll pick a nice guy to marry.
Maybe have a kid or two.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.761
A happily ever after of my own.

34:14.844 --> 34:18.681
There isn't a word
to describe all that, is there?

34:19.182 --> 34:20.266
Uh, yeah, there is.

34:20.933 --> 34:21.934
Dumb!

34:22.018 --> 34:23.352
Shut the fuck up, Sa-ra.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.481
Scary.

34:28.858 --> 34:29.859
Tell me.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.196
What's your dream then?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.240
It's you.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.620
You are what I dream about.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.164
I hope

34:44.707 --> 34:46.375
we'll meet again, Yeon-jin.

35:06.729 --> 35:09.774
SUMMER OF 2006

35:40.471 --> 35:42.306
Knock it off with that. Put it away.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.559
Hey! Go easy on her!

35:44.642 --> 35:47.562
Don't you see all the cigarette burns
on her arms and legs?

35:49.188 --> 35:50.189
Just get to work.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.460
I'm sorry, but I don't mean to bother you.

38:17.837 --> 38:22.341
Um… I'm twenty years old,
and my name is Gu Seong-hui.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.429
I heard you were leaving the factory
at the end of the month, miss.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.390
So I wanted to have
a talk with you, maybe,

38:29.473 --> 38:31.726
at least before you leave for good.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.771
I'm glad you did. Also, thanks.

38:36.772 --> 38:37.773
What for?

38:38.482 --> 38:39.317
Tip-toeing in.

38:40.192 --> 38:42.278
Oh, you noticed that…

38:42.862 --> 38:44.864
Anyway, congrats to you!

38:44.947 --> 38:47.450
I heard you got accepted into college.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.952
You must be so happy!

38:50.036 --> 38:53.456
In college, you can meet new people,
get a boyfriend…

38:56.667 --> 38:57.668
I can't do that.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.964
I'm there because I really need
to go somewhere.

39:02.548 --> 39:04.383
Oh. Where are you going, then?

39:06.135 --> 39:07.136
Samsung?

39:07.845 --> 39:08.679
Hyundai?

39:15.853 --> 39:17.438

And iced, please. I'm exhausted.

39:31.577 --> 39:33.996
How's an iced Americano
with an extra shot sound?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.665
Uh, sure. Can I get one?

39:39.210 --> 39:42.296
You can pick it up at the next counter.
Next customer, please.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.135
One black and a mocha latte.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.263
For the latte, a ton of whipped cream
and extra chocolate drizzle.

39:51.347 --> 39:54.266
We'll pay separately, but can you stamp
for both of these on my punch card?

39:54.350 --> 39:57.061
I knew you'd do that.
That's why I didn't bring my wallet.

39:57.144 --> 40:00.481
Pick up your drinks
at the counter. Who's next?

40:00.564 --> 40:01.857
Please step forward.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.902
I'm saving up.
Every little bit helps.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.488
So, then your punch card'll
turn into diamonds?

40:07.571 --> 40:10.116
-How's a punch card gonna make me rich?
-Come on, share the wealth.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.284
You always do this. Make me pay for you.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.370
-Why can't you pay for your own?
-Sorry…

40:15.621 --> 40:17.748
At least
you're one more stamp to becoming rich.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.583
The punch card can't help me do that.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.836
-How would they even do that?
-Hey, come on.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.213

<i>I'm guessing that you have it all.</i>

<i>There is only one place</i>
<i>that I can think of.</i>

41:02.543 --> 41:06.505
<i>In that gym where we were together.</i>
<i>Sixty square meters to share.</i>

41:06.589 --> 41:09.133
HA YE-SOL

41:09.216 --> 41:12.219
Wow, just like a fairy tale.

41:13.888 --> 41:14.847
<i>And now,</i>

41:15.347 --> 41:17.683
<i>I'll use your precious hair iron</i>
<i>against you.</i>

41:18.517 --> 41:22.521
<i>The one who is so soft,</i>
<i>with such fair skin.</i>

41:23.814 --> 41:25.274
My story's like a fairy tale?

41:25.357 --> 41:29.570
Yeah. But since my mommy's
not the hero, I don't like it.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.198
What makes you think that?

41:32.281 --> 41:34.950
Because my mommy has lots of money.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.953
Main characters are
supposed to have nothing at all.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.291
No, that's not true.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.669
In this story,
your mother is the main character.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.382
That's because this story isn't

41:51.467 --> 41:52.384
a fairy tale.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.515
<i>Fog is denser</i>

41:57.598 --> 42:00.643
when the visibility range is
less than a kilometer.

42:00.726 --> 42:03.979
The fog warning issues yesterday
is still in effect today.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.983
Did you know that fog can even
potentially pose a risk for planes

42:08.067 --> 42:10.569
even greater than a typhoon or lightning?

42:10.653 --> 42:12.905
If you love thy neighbor
like you love thy self…

42:15.866 --> 42:18.661
<i>Although the accidents are</i>
<i>more likely to occur on sunny days,</i>

42:18.744 --> 42:21.664
<i>the fatality rate is</i>
<i>the highest on foggy days.</i>

42:21.747 --> 42:24.124
<i>That's why it's important</i>
<i>to be careful of the fog.</i>

42:24.208 --> 42:25.209
<i>Park Yeon-jin signing out.</i>

42:25.292 --> 42:26.126
FOG WARNING

42:30.297 --> 42:31.757
<i>An eye for an eye,</i>

42:32.424 --> 42:33.759
<i>a tooth for a tooth.</i>

42:34.426 --> 42:36.095
<i>A scar for a scar.</i>

42:37.346 --> 42:40.808
<i>The one who injured</i>
<i>shall suffer the same injury.</i>

42:42.434 --> 42:43.769
<i>Well, maybe not.</i>

42:45.604 --> 42:49.108
<i>Then I would be playing too fair,</i>

42:50.693 --> 42:51.610
<i>don't you think?</i>
