WEBVTT

00:30.211 --> 00:33.248
So these are stories of
transformation and you can see

00:33.281 --> 00:36.785
that we don't find out what
Phoebus, the nominative noun,

00:36.818 --> 00:39.489
loves until all the way
at the end of the line,

00:39.522 --> 00:41.656
and everything else
comes in between.

00:41.690 --> 00:45.128
That is P-H-O-E-B-U-S...

00:45.160 --> 00:47.629
And... oops, I shouldn't
have written that extra "E"

00:47.662 --> 00:48.598
on the board.

03:32.994 --> 03:35.831
<i>My name is
Publius Ovidius Naso,</i>

03:35.863 --> 03:38.968
<i>although I would later
become better known as "Ovid."</i>

03:39.000 --> 03:40.969
<i>I was born in a time of peace.</i>

03:56.985 --> 04:00.556
There was a rape and a murder
here just the other day!

04:00.588 --> 04:02.624
You best be careful!

04:09.064 --> 04:10.700
Please, Your Majesty,

04:10.732 --> 04:12.367
we ask for your clemency!

04:12.400 --> 04:15.604
We were captured on
orders and forced to fight.

04:26.482 --> 04:27.783
You must die.

04:27.816 --> 04:28.618
No.

04:29.518 --> 04:30.619
No.

04:30.651 --> 04:31.486
No!

04:31.520 --> 04:33.056
No!

04:42.430 --> 04:44.532
Your Majesty, Your Eminence,

04:44.566 --> 04:46.902
I never knew Mark Antony!

04:46.934 --> 04:49.071
I was in the third infantry!

05:19.501 --> 05:20.602
What do you want?

05:20.636 --> 05:23.539
We've come on official
business from your father.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.641
Bugger...

05:26.675 --> 05:29.677
Your father is trying
to consolidate power

05:29.711 --> 05:31.080
which of course means...

05:31.112 --> 05:33.848
strengthening ties
to his generals.

05:33.881 --> 05:36.819
He wants you to marry Tiberius.

05:37.718 --> 05:39.154
Tiberius is married.

05:39.187 --> 05:43.057
Well, of course
there'll be a divorce.

05:43.090 --> 05:46.562
I'm still grieving my
late husband's passing.

05:46.595 --> 05:48.564
Tiberius' mother is...

05:48.597 --> 05:50.065
his wife, my step-mother.

05:50.098 --> 05:51.667
What other ties does he need?

05:51.699 --> 05:53.535
You know how much
your father cares about

05:53.569 --> 05:55.136
the importance of family.

05:55.170 --> 05:56.571
I have my family.

05:56.605 --> 05:58.474
I'm happy here.

05:58.506 --> 06:00.542
I'm afraid your
father's decision is

06:00.576 --> 06:02.111
the law of the land.

06:02.143 --> 06:05.713
This isn't a monarchy
or a dictatorship.

06:29.037 --> 06:32.241
<i>It was during this
time of peace I was born.</i>

06:32.273 --> 06:33.942
Hey man,
you got a coin?

06:35.009 --> 06:36.178
Uh, yeah.

06:39.514 --> 06:40.649
Tough times?

06:40.682 --> 06:44.252
While I was at war, my wife
got sick, I got injured...

06:44.285 --> 06:46.221
What war?

06:46.254 --> 06:48.523
- This is a time of peace.
- Peaceful for the people

06:48.557 --> 06:50.525
living within this nation.

06:50.559 --> 06:52.528
But what about our
fighting overseas

06:52.561 --> 06:54.662
with our barbarous
neighbors up north?

06:54.696 --> 06:57.166
Where do you think all our
Treasury money is going?

07:02.237 --> 07:03.539
Um...

07:05.607 --> 07:07.809
<i>After years of civil war,</i>

07:07.843 --> 07:10.612
<i>the newly anointed Emperor
Augustus had finally brought</i>

07:10.646 --> 07:12.814
<i>peace to the Roman Empire...</i>

07:12.848 --> 07:15.251
<i>by silencing the opposition.</i>

07:15.283 --> 07:19.687
We are glad to have
at our helm, a man, again,

07:19.720 --> 07:22.790
who is not only such a
capable leader and general,

07:22.824 --> 07:25.927
but one who truly
understands Roman values

07:25.961 --> 07:27.196
and our way of life:

07:27.228 --> 07:28.930
the Republic, the Senate,

07:28.963 --> 07:31.566
and the great
establishments of this Empire.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.768
Senex...

07:32.800 --> 07:35.170
- May I call you "Senex?"
- Of course.

07:35.203 --> 07:37.239
We are to be friends.

07:37.271 --> 07:40.942
I can't tell you how much
it pains me not to have

07:40.975 --> 07:43.912
more noble families represented.

07:43.946 --> 07:48.050
In this Empire, we believe
in electing our government.

07:49.585 --> 07:51.854
I would not be
Roman if I didn't.

07:53.622 --> 07:56.792
I want to thank you
for coming to see me.

07:56.824 --> 07:59.694
We shall see more
of you, I suppose.

07:59.727 --> 08:01.030
But of course.

08:13.307 --> 08:16.211
Then you are really determined
to restore the Republic?

08:17.612 --> 08:18.747
I have no choice.

08:18.780 --> 08:20.749
After all the bloodshed...

08:20.782 --> 08:22.885
civil wars...

08:22.917 --> 08:25.720
it's your firm leadership that
finally brought us to peace.

08:25.754 --> 08:27.823
- Tiberius...
- What, Mother?

08:27.855 --> 08:29.624
Cleary, if we are
to maintain peace,

08:29.658 --> 08:32.227
we must appease the
people and noble families.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.597
We have to restore the Republic.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.732
Then how do we consolidate power

08:36.765 --> 08:37.967
and keep control?

08:39.299 --> 08:42.035
We give them values.

08:42.068 --> 08:44.973
We give the people
something to believe in.

08:48.709 --> 08:51.846
<i>So how did I, a nice
boy from small-town Rome,</i>

08:51.880 --> 08:53.115
<i>end up in the big city,</i>

08:53.147 --> 08:56.918
<i>the capital itself, become the
most popular poet of my day,</i>

08:56.952 --> 08:59.322
<i>and end up in trouble
with the brutal Emperor?</i>

09:02.790 --> 09:05.627
<i>My story starts in
the small town of Sulmo,</i>

09:05.660 --> 09:08.329
<i>where we lived a simple
agrarian way of life.</i>

09:08.362 --> 09:11.099
<i>My parents' generation
had known only war.</i>

09:11.132 --> 09:13.035
<i>but thanks to the Pax Augustus,</i>

09:13.068 --> 09:15.871
<i>the peace created
by Emperor Augustus,</i>

09:15.904 --> 09:18.641
- <i>we had known only tranquility.</i>
- Ovid!

09:18.674 --> 09:20.742
Ovid, the men are here for you!

09:20.775 --> 09:23.078
The Emperor's men
are here for you!

09:23.111 --> 09:25.814
They came all the
way from Rome, Ovid!

09:25.847 --> 09:27.683
<i>Apparently,
being from a small town</i>

09:27.716 --> 09:30.719
<i>and of equestrian rank gave me
the "right values"</i>

09:30.751 --> 09:33.054
<i>that qualified me to be a Paul.</i>

09:33.088 --> 09:34.756
Ovid! Ovid!

09:34.790 --> 09:37.925
<i>And just like that,
they intruded on my life.</i>

09:37.958 --> 09:39.227
Of course you'll go.

09:39.261 --> 09:41.030
It's not even a question.

09:41.063 --> 09:42.297
Is it a
rhetorical question?

09:42.329 --> 09:44.766
- Don't be witty.
- I'm not being witty...

09:44.800 --> 09:47.803
- I'm being rhetorical.
- Stop being smart, Ovid.

09:47.835 --> 09:50.071
Isn't that what politicians
are supposed to be?

09:50.104 --> 09:51.205
Not necessarily.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.375
I don't understand
your resistance to this.

09:53.407 --> 09:55.943
Here you've been
hand-selected by the Emperor,

09:55.977 --> 09:58.347
by His Eminence,
Ceasar Augustus,

09:58.380 --> 10:01.216
to receive the best education
you could possibly receive,

10:01.248 --> 10:04.987
to work for the government, and
you want to throw it all away...

10:05.020 --> 10:06.722
because you'll miss the
babbling brook at the end

10:06.755 --> 10:10.391
of the property and the dirt
road you played on as a child.

10:10.425 --> 10:12.361
- Uh... yeah.
- Not to mention...

10:12.394 --> 10:13.595
Just a side-note:

10:13.628 --> 10:15.830
for any of you out there who
though you were the first one

10:15.863 --> 10:18.466
to be completely misunderstood
by your parents...

10:18.500 --> 10:20.703
this was 31 BCE.

10:20.736 --> 10:23.138
And you've been hand-selected
to help the senate more

10:23.170 --> 10:26.941
fairly represent the
outlying provinces,

10:26.974 --> 10:29.277
so that you could
help this great Empire

10:29.310 --> 10:30.845
reach it's potential,

10:30.878 --> 10:34.782
so that you can make society
a better and just place

10:34.815 --> 10:35.950
to live in.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.987
- My name is "nose."
- Gods bless Rome!

10:39.020 --> 10:41.857
- My name is "nose."
- I don't understand, Ovid.

10:41.890 --> 10:43.726
Are you listening to me?

10:43.758 --> 10:46.260
The boy is complaining
about his name again, Karina.

10:46.294 --> 10:49.430
Our name is "Naso,"
that means "nose!"

10:49.463 --> 10:52.734
Let's just say I learned
a lot and did really well.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.469
How far do you
really think I'd get?

10:54.502 --> 10:58.873
All hail our great leader
and national hero, Mister...

10:58.906 --> 11:01.876
or should I say Senator Nose.

11:01.910 --> 11:03.411
What was that?

11:03.444 --> 11:07.882
He really knows... oops, pardon
my pun... how to sniff out

11:07.915 --> 11:09.417
the bad and find the good.

11:09.450 --> 11:12.320
What did you say,
Publius Ovidius Naso?

11:12.353 --> 11:14.388
I hated when they addressed
me by my full name.

11:17.324 --> 11:19.294
I hated when they
used their formal Latin.

11:22.963 --> 11:24.465
The Cicero quotes
were the worst.

11:24.498 --> 11:26.300
This particular one
was from when Catalin

11:26.333 --> 11:28.904
had stormed into the Roman
Senate after he betrayed it.

11:35.242 --> 11:37.879
Look what you've done to your
mother in this time of peace.

11:37.913 --> 11:40.315
Is this why your grandfather
fought with the Roman Legions?

11:40.348 --> 11:43.117
Is this why... your uncle
is fighting right now

11:43.150 --> 11:45.453
against Mark Antony
in the Battle of Actium

11:45.487 --> 11:46.921
all the way in Egypt?

11:46.954 --> 11:48.924
Carpe Diem, Ovid.

11:48.957 --> 11:50.325
Seize the day.

11:50.357 --> 11:53.060
<i>And just like
that, it was settled.</i>

11:53.093 --> 11:54.829
I would go to Rome.

12:30.064 --> 12:30.900
Hey, man.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.535
Hey. Hi.

12:34.902 --> 12:36.070
You new here?

12:36.103 --> 12:37.839
Uh, yeah, I j...
I just got here.

12:38.873 --> 12:40.942
Oh, Maximilius, by the way.

12:40.976 --> 12:43.511
But you can call me... "Max."

12:44.478 --> 12:45.446
I'm, uh...

12:46.381 --> 12:47.049
Ovid.

12:47.082 --> 12:48.617
It's nice to meet you, Max.

12:48.650 --> 12:51.285
So what brings you
to the city, man?

12:51.319 --> 12:54.389
I was recruited by
the government so...

12:54.421 --> 12:55.990
law and government, basically.

12:56.024 --> 12:57.192
Oh, one of those!

12:57.224 --> 13:00.561
I get it; pass a few laws,
preside over a few executions,

13:00.594 --> 13:02.630
hobnob with the Emperor's
people, I get it.

13:02.664 --> 13:03.966
No, that
wasn't exactly the plan.

13:03.998 --> 13:05.399
I'm just fucking with you, man.

13:05.433 --> 13:07.169
I mean, maybe a
little execution?

13:09.570 --> 13:12.139
I'm not...
I'm fucking with you!

13:12.173 --> 13:13.274
Chill...

13:13.308 --> 13:15.110
Anyway, it's a great city.
Been here five years,

13:15.142 --> 13:16.177
never gets old.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.412
After all, this is Rome, man!

13:18.445 --> 13:19.881
The capital of our Empire,

13:19.915 --> 13:22.016
the center of our
universe, you know?

13:22.050 --> 13:26.154
It's got great nightlife, great
shopping, and oh, the women.

13:26.186 --> 13:28.155
Hey, that's why they call it
"the city that never sleeps,"

13:28.189 --> 13:30.525
you know what I'm saying?

13:30.558 --> 13:33.295
'Cause it...
everyone's... having sex.

13:33.328 --> 13:35.429
Anyway, uh...

13:35.463 --> 13:37.266
I... I gotta run,
but take it easy.

13:37.299 --> 13:38.567
Look me up if you
ever need anything.

13:38.599 --> 13:40.435
5E.

13:55.983 --> 13:57.184
That's enough.

13:57.218 --> 13:59.154
That's enough,
let's join the others.

14:17.104 --> 14:20.041
Oh, look,
my father's podium.

14:20.074 --> 14:21.275
Careful...

14:21.309 --> 14:23.646
we might ask you
to preside instead.

14:27.381 --> 14:30.218
Senex, my darling!

14:30.251 --> 14:31.352
- How are you?
- Oh!

14:31.386 --> 14:33.387
As good as ever, my dear.

14:33.420 --> 14:34.355
I miss you, Senex!

14:34.389 --> 14:36.358
I never see you at the
Capitoline building,

14:36.391 --> 14:38.593
where all you Senators
supposedly work.

14:38.626 --> 14:41.262
You might not miss me so
much if they ever restored

14:41.295 --> 14:43.965
the actual powers
of the Roman Republic.

14:43.998 --> 14:44.933
Mwah!

14:44.967 --> 14:46.400
You were always my favorite.

14:46.434 --> 14:47.569
Maybe I can help.

14:48.402 --> 14:49.604
Please do!

14:52.173 --> 14:54.343
Order!

14:54.376 --> 14:55.644
Order...

14:55.678 --> 14:58.981
I never thought I'd see you
wielding your father's gavel.

14:59.014 --> 15:01.616
Well, you know how much
blood ties and family values

15:01.649 --> 15:02.985
mean to us.

15:03.017 --> 15:06.088
Good evening,
fine citizens of Rome!

15:07.088 --> 15:09.757
In honor of the 15th
year of the Restoration

15:09.790 --> 15:11.760
of the Republic,

15:11.793 --> 15:14.496
through no
democratic vote at all,

15:14.529 --> 15:18.667
we have appointed our Emperor
Ceasar Augustus' daughter,

15:18.699 --> 15:23.537
Julia, to take his place
at his almighty podium.

15:23.570 --> 15:26.540
And to see how she,

15:26.574 --> 15:29.410
through the barter of
sexual favors...

15:29.444 --> 15:32.514
might fix the current
political situation.

15:35.617 --> 15:38.020
First on the docket:

15:38.053 --> 15:40.122
world hunger.

15:40.155 --> 15:43.791
It has come to my attention
that in the developed world,

15:43.824 --> 15:47.396
while those of us in the upper
classes have plenty to eat,

15:47.429 --> 15:51.100
everyone else seems to be out
of work and, at times, starving.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.267
My solution?

15:54.501 --> 15:57.671
Fellatio.

15:57.704 --> 16:02.477
Yes, one lucky man, or
woman, as the case may be,

16:02.510 --> 16:05.347
who can solve this
problem of inequity,

16:05.380 --> 16:08.450
institutionalized by
our governing order,

16:08.482 --> 16:12.554
will receive a blowjob
from yours truly.

16:14.222 --> 16:17.324
And remember, this
is no ordinary spit!

16:17.357 --> 16:22.130
The spit that will alight
your dong is royal saliva...

16:23.131 --> 16:26.068
passed down from the
divine Emperor himself.

16:27.202 --> 16:28.437
Okay!

16:28.469 --> 16:30.504
Second on the list:

16:30.538 --> 16:33.341
true restoration of
the Roman Republic.

16:33.373 --> 16:34.442
At last!

16:34.476 --> 16:36.344
It has come to my attention,

16:36.376 --> 16:41.149
through my position as royal
baby-maker and diaper-changer...

16:41.181 --> 16:45.186
that while we supposedly have
a representative government,

16:45.219 --> 16:48.489
this representative
government has no actual power.

16:48.522 --> 16:50.624
Furthermore...

16:50.657 --> 16:52.626
it appears that the Senators
have nothing better to do

16:52.660 --> 16:55.796
than hang out with
this divine baby-maker...

16:55.829 --> 16:59.333
since no senatorial
work is being done at all.

17:01.569 --> 17:05.173
To solve this, I offer you...

17:07.442 --> 17:11.213
I offer you the whole package...

17:11.244 --> 17:13.513
cunnilingus and all.

17:14.580 --> 17:15.751
Stop, Julia!

17:17.652 --> 17:18.453
Stop.

17:19.453 --> 17:20.722
This is too much.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.726
Lepidus.

17:24.759 --> 17:27.429
Your father will be outraged.

18:00.962 --> 18:04.566
So today, we will be looking
at the Augustan Law Code,

18:04.598 --> 18:07.535
and in particular, updates
since the Pax Augusta

18:07.569 --> 18:08.503
was established,

18:08.537 --> 18:11.173
along with the
Restoration of the Republic.

18:11.205 --> 18:12.174
Okay.

18:12.206 --> 18:13.675
Can everyone flip to page two?

18:15.342 --> 18:15.843
Psst!

18:19.480 --> 18:20.815
Maximilius, what
are you doing here?

18:20.848 --> 18:22.216
Shh.

18:22.250 --> 18:23.818
I go to school here.

18:23.850 --> 18:26.187
- What?
- Today, we will be looking at

18:26.221 --> 18:27.189
new laws,

18:27.222 --> 18:30.559
such as the Lex Julia
De Maritanis Ordinibos,

18:30.591 --> 18:33.794
and the Lex Julia De
Adulteriis Coercendis.

18:33.828 --> 18:35.963
- Can anyone tell me...
- You go to school here?

18:35.996 --> 18:37.464
I thought you were
making fun of me for being

18:37.498 --> 18:39.234
a law student government type.

18:39.267 --> 18:41.436
Yeah, I was.

18:41.469 --> 18:43.405
Well, that's my
nighttime persona.

18:43.437 --> 18:45.506
- Your what?
- My nighttime persona.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.341
For the uptown clubs
and the art scene.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.243
I, like, play music and shit.

18:49.277 --> 18:50.812
Your "nighttime persona."

18:52.280 --> 18:55.349
Lex De Maritandis Ordinibos.

18:55.383 --> 18:57.452
Roman males who do
not marry are to remain

18:57.484 --> 19:00.655
under the financial
guardianship of their fathers.

19:00.687 --> 19:02.957
So this is your daytime persona?

19:02.991 --> 19:04.326
Uh, yeah.

19:04.358 --> 19:05.460
Does everyone have that?

19:05.492 --> 19:07.494
It should be fairly
straight-forward.

19:07.528 --> 19:10.799
This law is clearly intended
to promote marriage and family.

19:10.831 --> 19:12.900
Look, man, it's not that weird.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.502
A lot of poets do it.

19:15.802 --> 19:17.438
- Poets?
- Poets.

19:17.472 --> 19:19.241
You know, the people
that are speakin',

19:19.273 --> 19:20.875
the words that
you're hearin'.

19:20.907 --> 19:22.644
<i>Pow.</i> Poetry!

19:22.676 --> 19:26.481
Okay, next, uh, Lex Julia
De Adulteriis Coercendis.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.649
- What?
- Gentleman in the first row

19:28.683 --> 19:30.419
seems to have something to say.

19:32.587 --> 19:35.290
Or perhaps your neighbor,
the young lady in the glasses,

19:35.322 --> 19:36.424
can assist you.

19:36.457 --> 19:39.261
It's a law recently
enacted to stamp out adultery.

19:39.293 --> 19:41.028
It states that both
offenders will be exiled

19:41.061 --> 19:42.129
to two different islands,

19:42.163 --> 19:44.866
and the adulturous man
will lose half his property.

19:44.898 --> 19:45.899
Very good.

19:45.933 --> 19:48.369
One indiscretion, two islands.

19:49.404 --> 19:50.805
Okay, great, moving on.

19:50.838 --> 19:52.507
Why would Augustus
try to legislate

19:52.540 --> 19:54.276
and govern people's
private lives?

19:54.309 --> 19:55.510
Roman values.

19:57.944 --> 19:59.380
How could you do this?!

20:00.580 --> 20:02.283
My own daughter!

20:02.317 --> 20:04.486
My own bloodline!

20:04.519 --> 20:06.621
Don't you know how hard I am...

20:06.654 --> 20:08.690
trying, trying

20:08.723 --> 20:11.292
to bring Rome back

20:11.326 --> 20:13.295
to its glorious state?

20:13.328 --> 20:16.431
All the people that
I'm trying to satisfy?

20:18.598 --> 20:20.769
To... to encourage

20:20.801 --> 20:22.404
and promote

20:22.436 --> 20:26.573
good values, like
family and marriage?

20:26.607 --> 20:27.576
And now this?

20:31.945 --> 20:34.815
This, holding public revels...

20:34.848 --> 20:36.917
and bartering sexual favors at...

20:38.418 --> 20:39.387
at my...

20:40.620 --> 20:42.623
my sanctified podium.

20:43.624 --> 20:44.726
I just figured...

20:47.462 --> 20:48.063
What?

20:50.365 --> 20:51.598
I figured...

20:51.632 --> 20:55.437
since I gave sexual
favors to my husband,

20:55.470 --> 20:56.971
your step-son, Tiberius,

20:57.003 --> 21:00.507
for the advancement
of your career...

21:00.540 --> 21:03.979
surely, I could help out by
offering them to others, too.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.759
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce you to the...

21:17.791 --> 21:19.593
penitentiary juris,

21:19.626 --> 21:22.530
otherwise known as
"the prison of law."

21:22.562 --> 21:23.732
Is there any other kind?

21:25.867 --> 21:27.434
You could almost
hear the daily sentencing

21:27.467 --> 21:28.902
in the background.

21:28.935 --> 21:30.637
Meticulis, 10 years.

21:30.671 --> 21:33.074
Octiganalius, 40 years,
possession of cannabis.

21:38.413 --> 21:40.048
Ovid, are you paying attention?

21:40.947 --> 21:42.550
Yes, yeah, uh...

21:42.582 --> 21:45.519
theft, uh, life for
theft of Herculean statue.

21:45.552 --> 21:46.787
- Statue of Hercules.
- Good.

21:46.820 --> 21:51.559
Tomorrow, we will resume here to
witness an actual working trial.

21:51.591 --> 21:53.895
I see real promise in you all.

21:55.963 --> 21:56.865
Ovid!

22:01.101 --> 22:05.540
<i>♪ Oats, oats and beans
and barley grow ♪</i>

22:05.572 --> 22:08.475
<i>♪ Oats and beans
and barley grow ♪</i>

22:08.509 --> 22:10.812
<i>♪ Nor you or nor I
nor anyone know ♪</i>

22:10.845 --> 22:14.048
<i>♪ How oats and beans
and barley grow ♪</i>

22:14.080 --> 22:15.416
What happened to your friend?

22:15.450 --> 22:17.419
I think he's got
the love bug bad.

22:17.452 --> 22:19.186
He saw a beautiful
girl in the courts today.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.923
Possibly two, I'm
still unclear about it.

22:21.955 --> 22:23.625
I love her.

22:25.725 --> 22:27.962
I love... I love her.

22:27.994 --> 22:32.133
Ah, the, uh, "I see you
and now I'm in love" bug.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.736
No.

22:34.769 --> 22:36.703
Now, I'll never see her again.

22:38.505 --> 22:41.608
Well, listen, if you boys
aren't busy tomorrow night,

22:41.642 --> 22:44.979
I'm doing a poetry
slam at the Olive Tree.

22:45.011 --> 22:47.014
Yeah, totally.

22:47.048 --> 22:49.717
We would love to be
there, wouldn't we, Ovid?

22:49.750 --> 22:51.586
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes, we would.

22:51.618 --> 22:52.587
Yes.

22:53.954 --> 22:55.088
Yeah.

22:55.121 --> 22:57.724
I'll try to make
sure he's sober.

22:57.758 --> 22:59.461
That's probably a good idea.

22:59.493 --> 23:01.762
<i>♪ We've just about got
the city under control now ♪</i>

23:18.011 --> 23:19.880
So in the case
of the Treasury versus

23:19.914 --> 23:21.516
Liviana Romanolus,

23:21.549 --> 23:24.152
will the prosecution
please call its last witness?

23:24.184 --> 23:27.254
The prosecution would like
to call the defendant herself,

23:27.288 --> 23:29.891
Liviana Romanolus.

23:29.924 --> 23:32.059
Will you please
hold the Jupiter statue

23:32.092 --> 23:33.961
and raise your right hand?

23:35.796 --> 23:37.799
Do you, Liviana Romanolus,

23:37.831 --> 23:39.934
swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

23:39.966 --> 23:41.001
and nothing but the truth,

23:41.034 --> 23:42.970
so help you gods?

23:43.003 --> 23:43.937
I do.

23:43.971 --> 23:46.007
The prosecution may now start.

23:47.308 --> 23:49.478
You okay, man? Rough night?

23:49.944 --> 23:51.178
Yeah.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.579
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:52.613 --> 23:56.184
So, how much did
you owe the Treasury?

23:56.216 --> 23:58.285
4,000 aureus.

23:58.319 --> 24:01.623
And how much did you pay
back at the end of the year?

24:03.558 --> 24:04.626
Two...

24:04.658 --> 24:07.694
I'm sorry, can you speak
up so everybody can hear?

24:07.728 --> 24:10.098
200 aureus.

24:11.197 --> 24:13.100
200 aureus.

24:13.134 --> 24:16.703
That's... 3,800 aureus less

24:16.736 --> 24:18.171
than you owed.

24:18.204 --> 24:21.175
And did you not sign a contract
that said if you did not

24:21.207 --> 24:23.544
pay back the sum
total of your loan

24:23.578 --> 24:26.180
by the end of
this calendar year,

24:26.213 --> 24:29.951
you would give up all of your
possessions, land, and house?

24:29.983 --> 24:31.019
I did.

24:31.051 --> 24:33.987
The defendant signed a
contract with the Treasury

24:34.021 --> 24:36.124
that if she did not
pay back her loan,

24:36.156 --> 24:38.225
which she did not...

24:38.259 --> 24:40.595
She would have to
give up all of her property.

24:40.627 --> 24:42.896
No further questions
at this time, your honor.

24:42.930 --> 24:45.066
The prosecution rests its case.

24:45.098 --> 24:47.034
Thank you, prosecution.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.237
The defense may
now take the stand.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.039
Yes, Your
Honor, thank you.

24:52.740 --> 24:55.343
Why, Liviana Romanolus,

24:55.376 --> 24:58.812
did you agree to take
the loan to begin with?

24:58.846 --> 25:00.114
I did not.

25:00.146 --> 25:02.116
You did not.

25:02.148 --> 25:03.684
Then who did?

25:03.717 --> 25:04.785
My husband.

25:05.953 --> 25:07.021
Ooh...

25:07.053 --> 25:09.690
The government, in an
effort to encourage farmers,

25:09.723 --> 25:15.629
offered large loans
to buy land and oxen.

25:15.663 --> 25:17.832
At the time, it
seemed like a good idea.

25:18.765 --> 25:20.734
Our land was fertile...

25:20.768 --> 25:23.338
and my husband was healthy.

25:23.370 --> 25:26.040
And then the plagues hit.

25:26.072 --> 25:29.643
And all of our oxen
and cattle were killed.

25:31.811 --> 25:35.950
My husband became ill,
and he eventually died.

25:38.219 --> 25:41.122
I had no way to pay
back the Treasury.

25:44.325 --> 25:47.662
And all of our savings...

25:47.694 --> 25:49.630
had gone to pay
the doctor bills.

25:52.232 --> 25:54.935
And how did your name
end up on the contract?

25:56.037 --> 25:58.940
Roman law states

25:58.973 --> 26:01.175
that when the husband dies,

26:01.207 --> 26:04.778
the wife inherits his wealth

26:04.811 --> 26:06.747
or his debt.

26:06.780 --> 26:08.915
So you were forced...

26:08.948 --> 26:10.751
- to sign the document?
- Yes.

26:10.784 --> 26:12.285
By law, I was.

26:12.319 --> 26:14.187
And what will happen
to you and your daughters

26:14.221 --> 26:16.057
if you lose your property?

26:17.191 --> 26:19.327
We will be forced...

26:19.359 --> 26:20.895
to the streets

26:20.927 --> 26:22.896
to fend for ourselves.

26:24.231 --> 26:26.367
The defense
rests its case.

26:26.399 --> 26:29.936
We just ask that you act
with compassion, Your Honor.

26:29.970 --> 26:34.208
I, of all people, understand
the few recourses that are left

26:34.241 --> 26:36.978
for women of a
certain class in Rome.

26:37.011 --> 26:41.415
However, you do understand
that the law is the law.

26:41.448 --> 26:43.784
Man, you've gotta lay
off the fermented grapes,

26:43.818 --> 26:45.052
you know what I'm sayin'?

26:45.086 --> 26:47.221
You were singing "Oats and Beans
and Barley Grows" last night,

26:47.253 --> 26:48.955
and that song doesn't sound
like it's gonna be around

26:48.989 --> 26:51.358
for another half millennium.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.761
Dude, I'm fine.

26:53.793 --> 26:56.229
I just... I just gotta remember
to drink more water next time.

26:57.732 --> 27:00.434
Court is now in session.

27:00.467 --> 27:02.703
Chief Scholar Gaius,
have you selected a pupil

27:02.736 --> 27:04.104
to read the verdict?

27:04.137 --> 27:06.707
I think Ovid would like to read

27:06.741 --> 27:09.176
because he's been so
attentive during this trial.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.011
Well?

27:23.022 --> 27:24.291
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:52.919 --> 27:53.454
No.

27:56.290 --> 27:57.925
What do you mean "no?"

27:57.957 --> 27:59.359
The verdict is "guilty."

28:02.061 --> 28:04.431
I mean no, I'm
not gonna read it.

28:04.464 --> 28:07.135
Do you realize it is your
duty as a student of law

28:07.167 --> 28:09.904
and government in
the Empire of Rome?

28:11.238 --> 28:13.040
I know.

28:13.072 --> 28:14.208
And I'm not gonna read it.

28:16.810 --> 28:19.780
Do you understand, young man,
that you will not achieve status

28:19.813 --> 28:20.947
as a government official

28:20.981 --> 28:23.151
if you do not comply
with your duties?

28:30.124 --> 28:31.526
Then I'll be a poet.

28:36.530 --> 28:39.166
My dear boy, that
is not practical!

28:41.100 --> 28:42.469
Then it will be practical.

28:54.848 --> 28:56.317
Ovid, are you crazy, man?

28:56.349 --> 28:57.350
A poet?

28:57.384 --> 28:59.086
Have you lost your mind?

28:59.118 --> 29:01.088
I mean, it's one thing
to moonlight, like me,

29:01.120 --> 29:04.090
but to go full-time and
just throw away your whole...

29:04.124 --> 29:06.059
Plus, you were so damn
lucky that judge was

29:06.092 --> 29:07.093
in a good mood today.

29:07.127 --> 29:08.896
You could've been held
in contempt of court!

29:08.928 --> 29:10.964
I'm a personal recruit
of the Emperor Augustus.

29:10.998 --> 29:11.933
They'll never do that to me.

29:11.965 --> 29:13.967
Hey, besides, man, I
hate to bring this up,

29:14.001 --> 29:15.603
but your last name is "nose!"

29:15.636 --> 29:17.437
And I just don't think you
can have a literary career

29:17.471 --> 29:18.271
with the last name "nose."

29:18.305 --> 29:19.473
Okay, I got it.

29:19.505 --> 29:21.242
What are you gonna
do all day, man?

29:21.274 --> 29:23.977
Just sit around and write about
your non-existent love life?

29:24.011 --> 29:25.413
And who ever heard
of a practical poet?

29:25.445 --> 29:28.249
That's like a cold
fire or an uncool Max,

29:28.281 --> 29:29.850
you know what I'm sayin'?

29:35.289 --> 29:36.424
She's just...

29:45.566 --> 29:47.535
What do
you mean by "restless?"

29:47.568 --> 29:50.003
Well, there are
those among the lower class

29:50.037 --> 29:53.641
who are jobless and
lack other resources.

29:53.674 --> 29:56.010
And you say
they're increasingly restless?

29:56.042 --> 29:57.310
Well...

29:57.345 --> 30:00.280
they would at least like to feel
like they're not being ignored.

30:02.482 --> 30:04.519
This drought's not
good for the economy.

30:05.919 --> 30:08.021
- Will they revolt?
- Not yet.

30:08.055 --> 30:10.024
But...

30:10.057 --> 30:14.161
it would be my advice to somehow
start paying attention to them.

30:14.194 --> 30:15.029
Lepidus.

30:16.030 --> 30:16.897
Livia.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.200
Then what do we do now?

30:21.301 --> 30:23.303
I think we need to
provide a distraction.

30:23.337 --> 30:25.338
- A distraction?
- Yes.

30:25.371 --> 30:29.376
We need to remind them
what their country stands for.

30:29.409 --> 30:32.579
The values and building blocks
that make this great Empire

30:32.613 --> 30:34.916
the greatest in the world.

30:34.948 --> 30:38.451
The reasons why countless Roman
legions have gone to their death

30:38.484 --> 30:41.321
to protect us from those
blonde-haired, blue-eyed

30:41.355 --> 30:44.357
barbarians up north.

30:44.390 --> 30:48.061
We need to remind them
of their Roman values.

30:49.562 --> 30:50.964
"Roman values," eh?

30:52.265 --> 30:54.001
You mean "family values."

30:57.370 --> 30:59.706
How am I supposed to do
that when my own daughter

30:59.740 --> 31:02.076
undermines me at every turn?

31:02.108 --> 31:03.276
I told you, Augustus,

31:03.309 --> 31:05.713
she's making you
look like a hypocrite.

31:05.745 --> 31:08.415
You need to rein her in.

31:08.448 --> 31:09.249
Yes.

31:10.384 --> 31:11.319
Thank you, dear.

31:14.521 --> 31:19.092
Well, Your Honor, if I may
be so bold as to suggest...

31:19.126 --> 31:20.227
a scapegoat.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.429
A scapegoat?

31:21.462 --> 31:23.164
A scapegoat.

31:23.196 --> 31:27.734
A public shaming using Julia as
an example of what will happen

31:27.768 --> 31:30.404
if you do not live up
to the moral foundations

31:30.436 --> 31:34.507
that make this Empire great.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.011
You know, of course, this
is my only living daughter.

31:38.145 --> 31:41.049
No matter what her flaws may be.

31:43.017 --> 31:45.053
Everyone loves a common cause.

31:45.786 --> 31:47.555
We may be suffering,

31:47.588 --> 31:49.523
but we have our values.

31:50.723 --> 31:52.425
What say you?

31:52.459 --> 31:55.730
Well, I haven't gathered
the data together yet, but...

31:57.463 --> 32:00.268
I imagine what Lepidus
is saying could be correct.

32:07.573 --> 32:08.408
All right.

32:08.442 --> 32:10.078
An exile, then.

32:36.569 --> 32:38.071
Hey, Max.

32:38.105 --> 32:39.206
Agrippina.

32:39.239 --> 32:40.174
Hey, man, hey.

32:40.206 --> 32:42.742
If you were to go for
a leisurely stroll,

32:42.776 --> 32:44.312
where would you go?

32:48.482 --> 32:50.417
You do realize
the law is the law,

32:50.451 --> 32:52.819
whether you read the
defendant's verdict or not?

32:52.853 --> 32:53.988
Her goose is still cooked.

32:54.021 --> 32:56.057
I mean, she's still going
to lose all her property.

32:56.089 --> 32:58.192
You're just the messenger.

32:58.224 --> 33:00.293
Look, if you... if you were
to go for a leisurely stroll,

33:00.327 --> 33:02.463
where would you go?

33:02.495 --> 33:04.364
Some people go to
school to study.

33:07.134 --> 33:09.470
Fine, I'd go to the games.

33:09.502 --> 33:11.806
I would
go to a Colonite.

33:11.838 --> 33:12.839
Octavia's.

33:12.873 --> 33:14.308
No, maybe Pompeii's.

33:14.340 --> 33:17.210
I mean, there was
this one time I was out

33:17.243 --> 33:19.047
and there was
this man and...

33:20.481 --> 33:22.348
By Jove, I think
we have something.

33:22.382 --> 33:23.551
Who was that man?

33:24.651 --> 33:26.687
I'm just kidding, Agrippina.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.389
Who was that woman, though?

33:29.522 --> 33:31.224
- What woman?
- You know...

33:31.258 --> 33:32.259
the one at the courthouse.

33:32.291 --> 33:33.493
- Oh...
- She was quite beautiful.

33:33.527 --> 33:34.462
Her.

33:36.230 --> 33:36.831
Well?

33:38.232 --> 33:39.232
Well what?

33:40.166 --> 33:41.234
Who is she?

33:42.536 --> 33:44.839
She's my father's
brother-in-law's cousin

33:44.871 --> 33:47.240
twice removed.

33:47.273 --> 33:48.508
Don't even think about it.

33:48.541 --> 33:49.609
She's married.

33:51.811 --> 33:52.679
Married?

33:53.847 --> 33:56.117
Lex Julia De Adulteriis, bro.

34:21.706 --> 34:22.708
Do you come here often?

34:24.877 --> 34:26.246
It's a water fountain.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.514
Yeah, I know.

34:27.547 --> 34:29.183
It's, um...

34:29.216 --> 34:31.886
it's good water, right?

34:31.918 --> 34:32.953
Oh, yeah.

34:32.985 --> 34:35.588
This is what I've always
wanted my entire life:

34:35.621 --> 34:38.559
somebody who likes to
drink water as much as I do.

34:38.591 --> 34:40.693
Yeah, it's... it's relatively
clean though, right?

34:40.726 --> 34:42.562
It's not too acidic.

34:42.594 --> 34:45.197
It hasn't got typhoid or
malaria, not in this one.

34:45.231 --> 34:47.667
Don't you have anything better
to do than try and pick up women

34:47.699 --> 34:50.838
by comparing the pH balance
of public water works?

34:53.472 --> 34:54.206
Chocolate?

34:56.208 --> 34:56.710
No.

34:58.578 --> 35:01.548
Here's a hint for your
future conquests, green boy:

35:01.582 --> 35:02.750
don't use gifts.

35:02.783 --> 35:04.685
I'm either gonna
like you or I'm not.

35:04.718 --> 35:06.386
And secondly, I'm married.

35:08.254 --> 35:10.457
It is an arranged marriage...

35:10.490 --> 35:13.459
but still, extramarital,
federal offense.

35:13.493 --> 35:15.696
And if you do wanna
have an affair?

35:15.729 --> 35:16.964
Use discretion.

35:16.997 --> 35:18.464
Make friends with the maid.

35:18.497 --> 35:19.633
Show-off your strengths.

35:19.665 --> 35:21.202
You like art? Go
to an art museum.

35:21.234 --> 35:23.303
You're strong? Then
show-off your muscles.

35:23.336 --> 35:26.472
But don't use a water fountain
to try to pick up women.

35:26.506 --> 35:28.408
Fuck's sake,
everybody likes water.

35:35.515 --> 35:36.551
Don't I know you?

35:38.952 --> 35:39.886
I don't know.

35:39.919 --> 35:41.754
From the courthouse.

35:41.787 --> 35:43.323
You're the practical poet.

35:46.359 --> 35:47.394
Good luck with that.

36:32.305 --> 36:33.406
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

36:33.439 --> 36:35.408
Thank gods you're here!

36:35.441 --> 36:36.843
I was worried about you, bro.

36:36.877 --> 36:39.380
I was wondering what you
were up to since, you know,

36:39.412 --> 36:41.681
- you dropped out of...
- No, I'm... I'm... I'm fine, man.

36:41.714 --> 36:45.019
I... I... I figured
out some stuff to do.

36:45.051 --> 36:46.919
My dad is pissed, though, man.

36:46.952 --> 36:48.388
He says I'm gonna be a pauper.

36:48.421 --> 36:50.290
Rough, man, rough.

36:50.323 --> 36:51.925
Sorry about your money thing.

36:52.693 --> 36:54.727
But, remember...

36:54.760 --> 36:56.028
night persona

36:56.062 --> 37:00.066
and... and Max don't associate
with no law students, all right?

37:00.100 --> 37:01.269
Okay, come on.

37:07.473 --> 37:09.542
Not the ones that they've
imported from upper Germania.

37:09.575 --> 37:12.578
The local farm-fresh
ones are to die for.

37:12.611 --> 37:13.747
They're amazing.

37:14.613 --> 37:16.449
Max! Hey!

37:16.482 --> 37:17.417
You made it!

37:17.450 --> 37:18.452
Thank you for coming.

37:18.484 --> 37:18.986
Of course, Chlo.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.087
You know we dig you.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.855
Ovid, you came too.

37:21.888 --> 37:23.490
It's good to see you.

37:23.522 --> 37:26.327
I heard you're determined
to become a practical poet.

37:26.359 --> 37:28.695
Oh, yeah, that was...

37:28.729 --> 37:31.631
was... was pretty
stupid.

37:31.664 --> 37:33.599
Not that poetry's s... st... I...

37:33.633 --> 37:35.035
I financially ruined my life.

37:36.470 --> 37:37.471
Anyway...

37:37.504 --> 37:38.872
yeah, it was pr... it was
pretty fuckin' stupid.

37:38.905 --> 37:41.607
He's j...

37:41.640 --> 37:43.543
Oh, uh, that's my set.

37:44.778 --> 37:47.348
Well, if you like what you see,

37:47.381 --> 37:48.348
you should try it.

37:49.915 --> 37:50.751
Don't...

37:54.921 --> 37:57.325
Be cool! Try and be cool!

38:18.044 --> 38:19.546
Yo, ma'am! Hi.

38:19.578 --> 38:20.446
Can I help you?

38:20.479 --> 38:22.548
Uh, your mistress
is Corinna, correct?

38:22.582 --> 38:24.818
Is that any of your business?

38:24.850 --> 38:27.086
When is it easiest to
find Corinna by herself?

38:27.120 --> 38:28.789
Why do you need to know?

38:28.821 --> 38:30.590
Then she is Corinna.

38:30.624 --> 38:31.892
Can I help you with
your load, then?

38:31.925 --> 38:33.026
- Oh...
- Just...

38:39.064 --> 38:40.666
Oh, my, Fabia.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.903
I see you found
yourself a lover.

38:42.935 --> 38:43.604
Well, good for you, Fabia.

38:43.636 --> 38:45.171
I always knew you had it in you.

38:45.205 --> 38:46.540
But really, here in the sheets.

38:46.573 --> 38:48.809
- No.
- There must have been a more

38:48.841 --> 38:50.443
- romantic spot.
- This isn't what it seems.

38:50.477 --> 38:52.078
- I'm sure it isn't.
- No.

38:52.111 --> 38:53.247
I came here for you.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.682
I saw you in the court and
I was struck by your beauty.

38:55.714 --> 38:56.983
I'm sure you did, dear.

38:57.017 --> 38:58.685
I know men can be
promiscuous these days,

38:58.718 --> 39:00.821
but really, two
in one afternoon?

39:02.722 --> 39:03.557
Fabia...

39:07.493 --> 39:09.829
Well, the whole reason for
buying a local Estruscan

39:09.863 --> 39:11.964
is so that
you can save the horseshoes

39:11.997 --> 39:14.834
necessary for
transporting imported food

39:14.868 --> 39:18.672
so we can divert the iron
resources for other projects.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.209
Oh, my gods.

39:23.243 --> 39:24.044
Look who's back.

39:24.077 --> 39:25.611
What up,
yo, Olive Tree?

39:25.644 --> 39:26.545
What up, yo?

39:26.580 --> 39:28.215
I said
what up, yo, Olive Tree?

39:28.247 --> 39:29.883
What up, yo?

39:29.915 --> 39:31.751
- What a night, huh?
- Yes, sir!

39:31.785 --> 39:33.020
- Some night, huh?
- Yeah!

39:33.053 --> 39:34.521
We talked society,

39:34.553 --> 39:36.689
- we slammed, as usual.
- Yeah.

39:36.722 --> 39:39.125
And we just heard a war poem

39:39.158 --> 39:42.028
from one of our
national heroes, huh?

39:42.062 --> 39:43.697
Yeah, you can give
it up for Virgil!

39:46.700 --> 39:49.736
I guess that is why
we dominate the world.

39:50.836 --> 39:53.039
From the roots to the
truth, this is what we do!

39:53.073 --> 39:55.042
Ladies and locusts,
Senators and soldiers,

39:55.075 --> 39:56.910
- follow me to the Olive Tree.
- Yes!

39:56.943 --> 39:59.613
Our poetry,
poignant, powerful, honest.

39:59.646 --> 40:01.013
And now...

40:01.046 --> 40:04.251
now, the hour is upon us.

40:04.283 --> 40:07.186
Let us open up the floor to new
voices we've not heard before,

40:07.220 --> 40:07.988
- huh?
- Yeah!

40:08.021 --> 40:11.158
Might we have a
neophyte tonight?

40:11.191 --> 40:12.926
Anyone, any two,
it's all up to you.

40:12.959 --> 40:14.127
Even if you've
never read before

40:14.160 --> 40:17.897
now is your time to shine,
because you know what we say?

40:17.930 --> 40:19.131
Seize the day!

40:19.164 --> 40:20.867
You
know what we say?

40:20.901 --> 40:22.002
Seize the day!

40:22.035 --> 40:23.036
One more time!

40:23.068 --> 40:23.836
Seize the day!

40:23.870 --> 40:26.607
Let's seize the day!

40:26.640 --> 40:28.876
Any brave souls among us?

40:34.680 --> 40:35.948
Ah!

40:35.982 --> 40:40.019
Now, there's a man whose hand
I've not seen raised before.

40:40.053 --> 40:41.955
Why don't you come
up here, young blood?

40:47.060 --> 40:51.031
Not yet, you've got to earn that
at the Olive Tree.

40:51.064 --> 40:52.799
- What's your name?
- Ovid.

40:52.832 --> 40:54.801
- I can't hear you, please.
- Ovid.

40:54.834 --> 40:56.036
- O... O... Ovid?
- Ovid.

40:56.068 --> 40:56.936
- Ovid.
- Ovid.

40:56.970 --> 40:59.039
Ovid.

40:59.071 --> 41:01.175
Okay, Ovid, the stage is yours.

41:11.818 --> 41:12.620
Uh...

41:14.287 --> 41:16.122
The... the poem is about love...

41:17.591 --> 41:19.560
and it's called "Amores."

41:19.593 --> 41:20.661
"Amores?"

41:20.693 --> 41:22.828
"The object of love?"

41:22.861 --> 41:25.999
W... well, it also
means "lovers."

41:26.031 --> 41:27.334
"The object
of love?"

41:27.367 --> 41:30.102
Sounds like a love poem from
a lover who ain't gettin' any.

41:44.751 --> 41:45.752
"Amores."

41:46.620 --> 41:48.622
"Lovers."

41:48.655 --> 41:52.959
It was sultry and... and the day
had driven out the middle hour.

41:52.993 --> 41:55.729
Look, Corinna comes
veiled in an unbelted tunic

41:55.761 --> 41:58.097
with her parted hair
covering her fair neck.

41:58.131 --> 42:00.367
How flat her stomach,
how youthful her thigh.

42:00.399 --> 42:04.104
Why do I need to
report on every feature?

42:04.136 --> 42:06.006
I s... I saw nothing
not to... to...

42:06.039 --> 42:08.374
I saw nothing not to praise
and I pressed her naked body

42:08.408 --> 42:09.743
right up to mine.

42:09.776 --> 42:13.614
Uh, yup, clearly another
lover who wasn't gettin' any!

42:13.647 --> 42:15.182
Does it help you to masturbate

42:15.214 --> 42:17.651
to dream these
scenarios?

42:20.653 --> 42:22.021
Totally lame.

42:22.055 --> 42:24.959
He just realized it!

42:27.794 --> 42:31.131
Get your lame ass off
the stage.

42:32.966 --> 42:34.935
- Oh... oh, come on, Ovid.
- He 'bout to cry!

42:34.968 --> 42:36.303
- Ovid!
- He 'bout to cr...

42:36.336 --> 42:38.004
Come on, Ovid!

42:38.037 --> 42:41.240
Is this cat a poet
or a pervert?

42:41.274 --> 42:42.876
Hey, that's your fourth
one this week, baby.

42:42.908 --> 42:43.910
No, fifth, shit.

42:47.379 --> 42:48.615
So...

42:48.647 --> 42:52.285
you completed one year at the
Academy of Law and Government

42:52.318 --> 42:53.720
and yous dropped out.

42:54.988 --> 42:58.058
Yes, that... that's correct.

42:58.091 --> 43:01.928
But you were an Augustan recruit
from the Emperor's office?

43:01.961 --> 43:03.930
Yeah, I'm from small-town Rome.

43:03.963 --> 43:05.999
Equestrian class.

43:06.031 --> 43:09.035
And you did say that
you completed one year

43:09.068 --> 43:10.069
at the Academy.

43:10.102 --> 43:11.238
A year and some, in fact.

43:13.839 --> 43:14.941
Well...

43:14.973 --> 43:17.044
I guess we could find you a job.

43:17.077 --> 43:20.914
I do know we have a sentencing
position opening up, um...

43:22.347 --> 43:24.082
Yes, here it is.

43:24.084 --> 43:26.086
"A full-time paid position,

43:26.118 --> 43:28.387
sentencing of
capital punishments.

43:28.421 --> 43:31.957
Employee must read out
and certify death sentences

43:31.990 --> 43:33.693
to accused criminals.

43:33.727 --> 43:35.729
Bureaucratic experience a must.

43:35.761 --> 43:37.997
Equestrian class preferred."

43:41.868 --> 43:44.438
Well, you'd be good at
sentencing, wouldn't you?

43:44.470 --> 43:46.839
I mean, they cover that
in first year, don't they?

43:47.874 --> 43:49.810
Y... y... yeah.

43:49.843 --> 43:51.078
Yeah, they do.

44:21.341 --> 44:23.343
Fabia,
can you get that?

44:25.979 --> 44:27.013
Fabia!

44:30.350 --> 44:31.251
Coming!

44:31.285 --> 44:33.252
I forgot it's my
maid's afternoon off.

44:34.187 --> 44:35.789
Hello.

44:35.821 --> 44:38.858
Oh my, it's Fabia's lover.

44:38.892 --> 44:40.993
- I'm afraid she's not in today.
- No, Corinna...

44:41.026 --> 44:42.928
I... I'm here for you.

44:42.961 --> 44:44.930
My, you are fickle.

44:44.964 --> 44:47.801
Well, I never did think
Fabia had any taste, so...

44:47.834 --> 44:50.069
May... may we speak
inside for a moment?

44:50.102 --> 44:51.938
That's a bit forward,
don't you think?

44:55.207 --> 44:57.144
I noticed you at the courts.

44:58.343 --> 45:00.012
You watched with such intensity,

45:00.046 --> 45:03.350
as though you suffered
with each passerby...

45:03.383 --> 45:05.051
seeking justice for all.

45:07.053 --> 45:09.156
And your beauty...

45:09.189 --> 45:12.225
your gentle curls falling
over your face as if...

45:12.258 --> 45:13.926
to mask your inner soul.

45:16.229 --> 45:18.799
I'm married, you know.

45:18.832 --> 45:20.801
But since you seek
solace with strangers...

45:22.602 --> 45:23.971
a forced match.

45:27.506 --> 45:30.142
You're not here for Fabia?

45:30.176 --> 45:33.380
I offered to help your maid
and I tripped on the sheets.

45:33.412 --> 45:34.580
You swear you're
not here for Fabia?

45:34.613 --> 45:36.182
I swear.

45:36.216 --> 45:37.184
What do you swear on?

45:38.618 --> 45:39.353
By...

45:40.953 --> 45:42.388
by Jove's mighty lightning bolt.

45:44.256 --> 45:46.225
By your shaking limbs.

45:46.258 --> 45:48.394
By Minerva,

45:48.428 --> 45:50.063
the goddess of wisdom, herself.

45:55.968 --> 45:56.936
Okay, come in.

46:05.245 --> 46:07.848
So, Mr. Ovid "The Nose,"

46:07.881 --> 46:09.016
what do you do?

46:10.115 --> 46:11.017
Well...

46:11.984 --> 46:13.118
I'm a poet.

46:13.151 --> 46:15.454
- A poet?
- I guess.

46:15.488 --> 46:18.558
And how are you going to
make any money with that?

46:18.591 --> 46:20.460
I'm gonna be a practical one.

46:20.493 --> 46:22.095
Practical?

46:22.127 --> 46:25.332
Practical, indeed.

46:25.365 --> 46:27.000
Well, you have to stop
lounging around bedrooms

46:27.033 --> 46:28.301
with married women.

46:39.111 --> 46:41.080
Any luck getting
that wound dressed?

46:43.115 --> 46:44.884
We're in a time of peace.

46:44.917 --> 46:46.653
Veterans don't get benefits.

46:46.685 --> 46:49.488
But what about our
fighting over in Carthage?

46:49.522 --> 46:51.024
Pssh.

46:51.057 --> 46:52.559
That doesn't count.

46:52.591 --> 46:54.493
It's beyond our borders!

46:55.528 --> 46:57.230
Well...

46:57.263 --> 47:00.300
there's trouble a-brewing
in this time of peace.

47:00.332 --> 47:02.167
They say the number
of jobless is growing

47:02.200 --> 47:05.170
and they have begun
to take to the streets.

47:05.203 --> 47:07.539
I talked to Marcus
down in the Villa Romana?

47:07.573 --> 47:08.975
It's not good.

47:12.377 --> 47:13.613
What are they gonna do?

47:13.646 --> 47:15.147
Occupy a Portico?

47:15.180 --> 47:17.917
Look, everyone
has blades like you.

47:17.950 --> 47:19.318
There could be violence.

47:21.086 --> 47:23.422
No law in this city
bans a sword or dagger.

47:23.455 --> 47:26.059
The Senate shot
that down last year.

47:27.593 --> 47:29.361
Her wanton leaflets?

47:29.394 --> 47:31.931
How can leaflets be wanton?

47:32.698 --> 47:33.901
Wanton...

47:37.202 --> 47:38.338
ringlets?

47:38.370 --> 47:39.972
Her wanton ringlets.

47:40.006 --> 47:40.906
You know, Ovid,

47:40.941 --> 47:43.042
if you really wanna
be a practical poet,

47:43.075 --> 47:45.444
maybe you should stop
trying to seduce women

47:45.477 --> 47:48.347
and write a sensible
farmer's manual, like Virgil.

47:48.381 --> 47:52.152
He tells people when to sow
seeds and when to harvest them.

47:52.185 --> 47:53.553
And he says it all in verse.

47:58.256 --> 47:59.292
Agrippina...

48:02.160 --> 48:03.296
you're a genius!

48:04.397 --> 48:06.665
You...

48:06.698 --> 48:07.667
Yes! Yes!

48:10.535 --> 48:12.204
What is he up to now?

48:17.310 --> 48:18.545
Hey.

48:18.577 --> 48:20.612
I gotta get on
the program tonight.

48:20.646 --> 48:21.714
Excuse me...

48:22.548 --> 48:23.582
who are you?

48:23.615 --> 48:27.486
The greatness of Rome
was not built in one day!

48:27.519 --> 48:31.390
And neither shall our
futures be built this way!

48:31.423 --> 48:33.126
Rome number one.

48:33.158 --> 48:36.296
Rome
number one! Rome number one!

48:40.165 --> 48:41.667
Let's put it there for
Virgil, everybody!

48:41.700 --> 48:43.669
Let's put it there for Virgil.

48:43.702 --> 48:45.504
Huh?

48:45.537 --> 48:46.705
You know he's right.

48:46.738 --> 48:48.140
You know he's right!

48:48.173 --> 48:49.141
I know he's ri...

48:49.175 --> 48:50.542
When it comes to
military muscle?

48:50.575 --> 48:53.012
Rome's number one!

48:53.046 --> 48:56.149
- When it comes to culture?
- Rome's number one!

48:56.182 --> 48:58.685
- When it comes to cuisine?
- Rome's number one!

48:58.718 --> 49:00.653
- Art!
- Rome's number one!

49:00.685 --> 49:03.022
- Philosophy!
- Rome's number one!

49:03.055 --> 49:06.193
- The ladies.
- Rome's number one!

49:07.359 --> 49:10.763
Rome is number one, yeah.

49:10.796 --> 49:12.164
All right.

49:12.198 --> 49:13.700
So next up...

49:15.334 --> 49:17.037
another poet that, uh,

49:17.069 --> 49:20.439
I believe some of you
have heard from once before.

49:20.472 --> 49:26.012
Publius... Ovidius...
Naso.

49:28.448 --> 49:30.283
You can give him a little
bit, Olive Tree.

49:30.316 --> 49:33.020
Eh... eh... not too much,
not... not too much.

49:36.589 --> 49:38.425
Ovid has returned.

49:48.501 --> 49:51.303
I was preparing to
tell about weapons...

49:51.336 --> 49:54.473
and violent war
in serious meter...

49:54.506 --> 49:56.309
- when Cupid said...
- Cupid!

49:56.341 --> 49:58.343
The virgin love poet!

50:01.747 --> 50:03.515
Oh, here we go.

50:03.548 --> 50:07.486
When Cupid said,
and laughed...

50:07.519 --> 50:09.855
"Who gave you, cruel boy,

50:09.888 --> 50:12.091
this power over poetry?"

50:12.124 --> 50:14.260
The virgin love poet!

50:14.292 --> 50:19.098
All hail the
virgin love poet!

50:26.805 --> 50:29.141
If you wanted to find a
lover, where would you go?

50:30.243 --> 50:31.744
The virgin love poet.

50:31.776 --> 50:33.245
The virgin love poet!

50:33.278 --> 50:34.380
Where would you go?

50:35.814 --> 50:37.149
Where have you gone?

50:38.417 --> 50:39.819
Ah, shit, um...

50:41.821 --> 50:43.123
That's what I thought.

50:43.156 --> 50:44.391
What about you, sir?

50:46.292 --> 50:48.795
After you found her,
how would you keep her?

50:48.827 --> 50:50.796
How would he keep you, ma'am?

50:50.830 --> 50:53.165
Yeah, how would you keep me?

50:53.198 --> 50:56.435
I... I... I would, uh...
get her jewelry.

50:56.468 --> 50:58.871
Chocolates?

50:58.905 --> 51:00.906
And where would you find her?

51:00.939 --> 51:02.142
Through my mother.

51:05.877 --> 51:10.415
Anyone in this crowd who does
not know the art of love-making,

51:10.448 --> 51:13.485
let him hear my
expertise and gather my...

51:13.519 --> 51:14.687
magic formula.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.522
Ooh!

51:16.555 --> 51:18.157
Venus...

51:18.191 --> 51:21.426
has appointed me the
very mastermind of love!

51:21.459 --> 51:24.696
All hail the... virgin...

51:24.729 --> 51:27.833
Pleasure and skill
provoke this work.

51:27.867 --> 51:31.171
Pay attention, I
speak from experience.

51:32.772 --> 51:34.808
Aren't you being a bit racy?

51:35.740 --> 51:37.276
Well...

51:37.310 --> 51:39.179
anyone who hides their
body with long dresses

51:39.211 --> 51:42.614
or wears delicate ribbons
as an emblem of decency...

51:42.647 --> 51:46.586
- leave.
- Ooh!

51:46.618 --> 51:50.557
Rome has so many
luscious beauties.

51:50.589 --> 51:54.193
If you desire youth,
1,000 girls abound.

51:54.227 --> 51:58.731
Or, if you enjoy wiser ladies,
skilled from years of...

51:58.763 --> 52:00.466
- experience...
- Ooh!

52:00.499 --> 52:03.870
They too, believe
me, will be plentiful.

52:03.903 --> 52:06.439
So where do we find
these buxom beauties?

52:08.506 --> 52:11.610
Walk slowly in the
shade to Romans Colinade.

52:11.644 --> 52:16.649
Or the Portico, named after
that vendor Empress Livia.

52:16.682 --> 52:20.553
Empress Livia's or
Pompeii's Portico?

52:20.586 --> 52:22.722
Those are sacred
spots of the Empire.

52:22.754 --> 52:25.925
- That's treasonous.
- Yes, and what if I'm married?

52:25.957 --> 52:29.229
Ah, then the tiered theater
would be most fruitful for you.

52:29.261 --> 52:30.495
There, you can find a lover

52:30.528 --> 52:32.331
who you can have a
one-night-stand with,

52:32.365 --> 52:35.635
or who you can...
play with for a long time.

52:37.803 --> 52:39.705
What if she says no?

52:39.738 --> 52:42.374
Yeah, what if I say no?

52:42.408 --> 52:44.877
Even if she
rejects you, rejoice!

52:44.910 --> 52:48.580
Why be discouraged when there's
pleasure in new delights?

52:48.613 --> 52:51.416
Crops are more
abundant in another's field.

52:51.450 --> 52:54.254
And the neighboring herd...
has richer milk.

53:00.959 --> 53:02.427
That was marvelous.

53:02.461 --> 53:03.963
Simply divine!

53:03.995 --> 53:05.999
Where'd you come up
with an idea like that?

53:06.031 --> 53:07.834
It's terribly naughty.

53:07.867 --> 53:09.935
Ovid the love poet.

53:09.968 --> 53:12.271
You rocked it, man.

53:12.305 --> 53:12.939
- You rocked it.
- Thank you.

53:12.972 --> 53:14.406
Hey, hey, Ovid!

53:14.439 --> 53:15.474
Where can I buy a copy, man?

53:15.508 --> 53:17.010
I gotta get that shit.

53:17.042 --> 53:18.278
For my friend.

53:19.312 --> 53:21.547
You were heretical...

53:21.580 --> 53:23.283
offensive...

53:23.316 --> 53:25.818
a complete chauvanist...

53:25.850 --> 53:28.521
and I loved every moment of it!

53:28.553 --> 53:30.557
Ugh! That was amazing.

53:32.091 --> 53:32.993
Thank you.

53:53.879 --> 53:57.550
Congratulations, sir.

53:57.582 --> 54:01.553
You've rid the land of the
Empire's worst adulterer.

54:01.586 --> 54:02.487
Why, yes.

54:02.522 --> 54:06.793
Perhaps now peace
and stability can ensue.

54:06.825 --> 54:08.727
I struck the right
tone with my speech?

54:08.760 --> 54:09.795
Oh, yes.

54:09.828 --> 54:12.464
I thought the parts about
commitment to the values

54:12.497 --> 54:15.001
of the Roman people and
safeguarding the sanctity

54:15.033 --> 54:17.569
of marriage were
particularly good.

54:17.602 --> 54:19.972
Well, you know I've
always believed that

54:20.004 --> 54:23.008
a good moral backbone
will make this nation great.

54:23.776 --> 54:25.877
And...

54:25.910 --> 54:28.947
stability at home means
stability in the world,

54:28.981 --> 54:30.883
doesn't it?

54:30.915 --> 54:34.019
I just hope that Julia the
Younger does not turn out

54:34.053 --> 54:35.555
like her mother.

54:36.421 --> 54:38.523
What was that?

54:38.557 --> 54:41.761
I hope that Julia the
Younger, your granddaughter,

54:41.794 --> 54:44.629
does not turn out
to be like her mother.

54:44.662 --> 54:46.865
And why would you say that?

54:46.899 --> 54:48.667
Haven't we made an
example of her mother,

54:48.700 --> 54:51.503
my only living daughter?

54:51.537 --> 54:54.906
Well, yes, but you know that
most people who've committed

54:54.939 --> 54:56.943
treason have been
sentenced to death.

54:56.975 --> 54:59.511
Having her imprisoned away from
everything she's ever known,

54:59.544 --> 55:01.513
cherished and loved,

55:01.546 --> 55:05.885
showing that not even my...
my only daughter can escape...

55:07.051 --> 55:09.622
when moral codes are violated.

55:09.655 --> 55:13.693
Well, yes, love, my love...

55:13.725 --> 55:15.827
but I have heard things.

55:15.861 --> 55:17.763
Heard things?

55:17.796 --> 55:20.399
Well, yes, things.

55:21.734 --> 55:23.970
Heard what?

55:24.002 --> 55:26.972
Well, that perhaps Julia
the Younger has inherited

55:27.006 --> 55:28.975
some of her mother's traits.

55:29.008 --> 55:33.480
She has been known to carry on
in not the most savory manner.

55:42.220 --> 55:46.525
What a shame she wasn't
born of your blood.

55:47.993 --> 55:51.564
Well, besides...

55:51.597 --> 55:54.934
there's a young poet
of increasing popularity

55:54.966 --> 55:57.470
named... Ovid.

55:59.104 --> 56:02.107
Who's... Ovid?

56:04.109 --> 56:05.612
Who is Ovid?

56:19.091 --> 56:20.026
Darling...

56:20.059 --> 56:23.162
you know I could spend
all day with you...

56:23.194 --> 56:25.597
but my husband
comes back at four.

56:28.167 --> 56:30.002
You know you can
come back tomorrow.

56:35.508 --> 56:36.576
I know.

56:40.513 --> 56:44.584
The age which is apt for war
is also suitable for love.

56:44.617 --> 56:47.586
Lovers use the sleep of husbands

56:47.620 --> 56:50.623
and move their weapons
after the enemies sleep.

56:56.794 --> 56:58.664
How's
everything with the poetry?

57:01.232 --> 57:02.234
Good.

57:05.771 --> 57:06.772
Good.

57:09.274 --> 57:12.577
Run slowly, horses of the night.

57:12.611 --> 57:16.915
Why should I be punished
because your husband's feeble?

57:16.948 --> 57:19.952
Surely, I did not match
you with an aging man.

57:45.843 --> 57:47.513
Tacitus isn't your husband.

57:49.080 --> 57:51.050
- Another lover?
- What is that?

57:52.984 --> 57:56.055
Oh, something of
Fabia's.

57:56.088 --> 57:57.656
Silly Fabia.

57:59.857 --> 58:01.760
You and I both
know that's a lie.

58:19.611 --> 58:23.281
- All lovers are soldiers.
- Mm-hm.

58:23.314 --> 58:27.218
Believe me, even
Cupid has his own camp.

58:27.252 --> 58:31.223
Both lover and solider
keep watch all night.

58:31.256 --> 58:34.594
Those qualities which generals
look for in a brave soldier,

58:34.627 --> 58:37.196
a beautiful girl seeks too.

58:37.229 --> 58:40.232
And let your mistress
come and go as she pleases.

58:40.265 --> 58:43.102
The husbands let this
happen with their wives.

58:43.135 --> 58:46.705
With soft slumber,
add to the intrigue.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.755
Oh, my God!

59:02.787 --> 59:06.257
Thank you.

59:06.290 --> 59:07.993
- Great show!
- Thank you, thanks.

59:08.026 --> 59:10.862
Thank you, thank you.

59:10.896 --> 59:12.263
- Yo, hey.
- Great show.

59:12.296 --> 59:14.300
Thanks. Thank you, thank you.

59:18.736 --> 59:21.874
Yo! Hey!

59:21.906 --> 59:23.776
Hey!

59:23.809 --> 59:26.077
Hey, I... I hear you're doing
really well for yourself.

59:26.111 --> 59:27.747
- Congrats.
- Things are great.

59:27.780 --> 59:29.080
Where have you
been at lately?

59:29.113 --> 59:31.783
- Well, you know, uh...
- Listen, man, I'm in.

59:31.816 --> 59:32.917
You're gonna love it.

59:32.950 --> 59:33.818
Nighttime persona's
gonna love it.

59:33.852 --> 59:35.187
I've... I've got all
these hookups.

59:35.220 --> 59:37.156
Virgil just gave me a call.

59:37.189 --> 59:38.324
You gotta come out, man.

59:38.356 --> 59:40.225
Well, that sounds great, but I...

59:40.258 --> 59:43.028
I don't... do
that stuff no more.

59:44.095 --> 59:45.196
What? What do you mean?

59:45.231 --> 59:48.801
You know, for me, it's
like a balance and, uh...

59:48.834 --> 59:52.071
daytime persona's
kinda... taking over.

59:52.104 --> 59:53.673
You know, with me
and Agrippina, it's...

59:53.705 --> 59:55.341
Wh... Agrippina?

59:55.374 --> 59:58.711
Hey, Max don't associate
with no law school students.

59:58.743 --> 01:00:02.981
Well, she's the smartest
in the class so Max kinda...

01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:04.917
do associate with her

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.819
and it's getting pretty
serious, actually.

01:00:07.852 --> 01:00:09.854
Okay, well, come on, man,
that doesn't mean you...

01:00:09.888 --> 01:00:11.223
you can't still
have a good time.

01:00:11.256 --> 01:00:14.225
Look, man, I have to
be a practical lawyer.

01:00:14.258 --> 01:00:15.359
And...

01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:18.731
well, Agrippina wants to
settle down and start a family,

01:00:18.763 --> 01:00:19.865
and you...

01:00:22.133 --> 01:00:24.803
you may be in real
trouble with the government,

01:00:24.836 --> 01:00:28.073
I mean real danger if you
keep going on like this.

01:00:29.274 --> 01:00:33.713
Uh, hey, man, keep it real.

01:00:33.745 --> 01:00:36.014
- Yeah.
- Hey, you're missing out.

01:00:38.249 --> 01:00:42.387
Hey, you know, Agrippina's the
best lawyer in the business.

01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:43.356
Well...

01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:46.858
since there might be trouble.

01:00:52.531 --> 01:00:56.769
I'm, uh... real happy
for your success...

01:00:56.801 --> 01:00:58.870
- and all.
- Thanks, man.

01:01:19.557 --> 01:01:22.427
So you're Ovid?

01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:26.031
You know, I've always
wanted to go home

01:01:26.064 --> 01:01:28.100
with a man named "Nose?"

01:01:32.838 --> 01:01:35.006
Well, then, perhaps
I'll nuzzle you.

01:01:36.841 --> 01:01:39.110
Distance yourself from crime.

01:01:39.144 --> 01:01:40.846
Be free of murder.

01:01:40.879 --> 01:01:44.951
Trick only girls if
you have sense.

01:01:46.484 --> 01:01:48.187
And cheat cheaters.

01:01:49.287 --> 01:01:51.222
They sink into their own traps.

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:01.533
Ovid!

01:02:08.073 --> 01:02:09.107
<i>What up,
yo, Olive Tree?</i>

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.376
<i>What up, yo?</i>

01:02:10.408 --> 01:02:11.477
<i>I said what
up, yo, Olive Tree?</i>

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.912
<i>What up, yo?</i>

01:02:12.944 --> 01:02:14.914
All right, look,
you're in for a treat.

01:02:14.946 --> 01:02:17.316
Because this cat coming up
next truly earned his stripes

01:02:17.348 --> 01:02:18.383
up here.

01:02:18.417 --> 01:02:20.953
<i>He is, without question,
our most popular poet.</i>

01:02:20.986 --> 01:02:22.354
<i>Now, look, I don't know
what ladies love more,</i>

01:02:22.386 --> 01:02:24.589
<i>his locks or his lyrics.</i>

01:02:24.622 --> 01:02:25.925
But they love him.

01:02:25.957 --> 01:02:29.861
Reading from his best-selling
book, <i>The Art of Love,</i>

01:02:29.894 --> 01:02:31.196
Ovid the love poet.

01:02:31.229 --> 01:02:33.598
Come on, Ovid!

01:02:33.631 --> 01:02:35.501
- Let's get it, baby!
- What up?

01:02:35.533 --> 01:02:37.502
Let's get it!

01:02:37.535 --> 01:02:38.771
Come on, man.

01:02:38.803 --> 01:02:42.106
These wicked verses, too, are
born of that small-town poet,

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.243
Naso, appointed by naughty love.

01:02:47.578 --> 01:02:49.481
Austere people,
stay at a distance.

01:02:49.513 --> 01:02:51.517
This theater of illicit rhythm
is by no means suitable

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.252
for your tender ear.

01:02:53.285 --> 01:02:54.086
Come on, now.

01:02:54.118 --> 01:02:57.622
To capture your
desire, swear on...

01:02:57.656 --> 01:03:01.260
anything you like.

01:03:02.526 --> 01:03:04.530
Yeah, man, yeah.

01:03:22.914 --> 01:03:24.182
Bring him in.

01:03:58.316 --> 01:03:59.217
Who's there?

01:03:59.952 --> 01:04:01.153
Crispus.

01:04:01.185 --> 01:04:03.155
I am a plebeian.

01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:04.689
What do you want?

01:04:04.722 --> 01:04:06.491
I'm a friend of your mother's.

01:04:06.524 --> 01:04:08.593
- The people...
- How do I know that?

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:24.376
What do you want?

01:04:24.408 --> 01:04:27.078
There's unrest in the camp.

01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:30.115
People are starving
and out of work.

01:04:30.147 --> 01:04:31.917
There could be violence.

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:41.993
But what if
you're a prude, Ovid?

01:04:42.026 --> 01:04:43.461
What if you're a prude?

01:04:45.129 --> 01:04:47.665
Again, no long-skirted
respectable ladies

01:04:47.698 --> 01:04:49.334
figure in my fun.

01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:50.670
Yeah!

01:04:51.535 --> 01:04:53.604
What about gifts?

01:04:53.638 --> 01:04:54.806
Don't use them.

01:04:54.839 --> 01:04:58.143
The only gift you give should
be that of your own body.

01:04:58.176 --> 01:04:59.144
Ooh!

01:04:59.176 --> 01:05:01.245
By which, of course, I
mean your wit and charm.

01:05:03.314 --> 01:05:05.517
Oh, look, there seems to be a
beautiful woman waving at me.

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.019
See what I mean about
not needing material gifts?

01:05:09.388 --> 01:05:11.390
What about the women, Ovid?

01:05:11.423 --> 01:05:12.658
What about us?

01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:15.394
What about you?

01:05:15.426 --> 01:05:17.662
I seem to devote a fair
amount of time to you.

01:05:19.664 --> 01:05:22.568
But, I mean, all of
your writing is for men.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.238
How to catch us,
keep us, tame us.

01:05:26.271 --> 01:05:27.705
When do we get ours?

01:05:27.738 --> 01:05:31.409
Do we have no say
in our destinies?

01:05:31.443 --> 01:05:33.678
I guess the lady
does have a point.

01:05:33.711 --> 01:05:36.681
- What is your name?
- Tacita.

01:05:36.714 --> 01:05:39.785
Tacita, would you like
me to finish the poem?

01:05:39.818 --> 01:05:42.088
Yes!

01:05:43.588 --> 01:05:45.290
That would be lovely.

01:05:45.323 --> 01:05:50.295
How great Achilles was
in battle, so I am in love.

01:05:50.327 --> 01:05:52.130
Celebrate me as
a prophet, lads!

01:05:52.164 --> 01:05:53.365
Sing my praises!

01:05:53.397 --> 01:05:57.169
Tell the world that I
have given you weapons!

01:05:57.202 --> 01:05:59.171
Go out and use them

01:05:59.203 --> 01:06:02.173
to conquer!

01:06:02.207 --> 01:06:03.175
Hey, hey, hey.

01:06:03.207 --> 01:06:05.810
Look, over there,
girls now ask for lessons.

01:06:05.843 --> 01:06:06.644
I give over.

01:06:06.678 --> 01:06:08.446
Yours shall be
my instant concern.

01:06:08.479 --> 01:06:10.214
In the
name of His Eminence,

01:06:10.247 --> 01:06:12.082
Emperor Caesar Augustus...

01:06:12.084 --> 01:06:13.486
Freeze.

01:06:15.486 --> 01:06:17.423
Surely, you can't be arresting
me for finally giving advice

01:06:17.455 --> 01:06:18.490
to the ladies.

01:06:18.524 --> 01:06:23.062
You are hereby fined for
contempt of Roman policy.

01:06:23.095 --> 01:06:25.064
Aren't we the center of
the enlightened universe?

01:06:25.097 --> 01:06:27.131
Don't get smart.

01:06:27.164 --> 01:06:29.734
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:06:42.647 --> 01:06:43.649
Geez.

01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:49.455
F......

01:07:06.504 --> 01:07:08.473
Nice stone
collection you got there.

01:07:08.506 --> 01:07:09.374
Thanks.

01:07:11.408 --> 01:07:12.510
Don't I know you?

01:07:12.544 --> 01:07:13.779
How would I know?

01:07:16.515 --> 01:07:18.283
Do you always pick
out special stones

01:07:18.316 --> 01:07:20.118
to desecrate royal property?

01:07:21.919 --> 01:07:23.588
Don't worry, they're soft.

01:07:25.923 --> 01:07:27.658
Be careful.

01:07:27.691 --> 01:07:29.660
You might get us in
trouble with the state.

01:07:31.296 --> 01:07:33.698
Isn't that why we're in here?

01:07:33.731 --> 01:07:35.567
Well, that must be
why you're in here.

01:07:36.834 --> 01:07:38.636
I'm in here for words.

01:07:38.669 --> 01:07:39.872
Words?

01:07:39.905 --> 01:07:40.872
Words.

01:07:43.941 --> 01:07:45.644
So, what, are
you a great writer?

01:07:47.178 --> 01:07:49.214
I'm no Virgil or Homer.

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:54.919
Then what, Mr. Writer,

01:07:54.952 --> 01:07:58.556
if not an epic national
poem, do you write?

01:07:58.589 --> 01:08:00.191
Sketches.

01:08:00.225 --> 01:08:01.193
Sketches?

01:08:01.859 --> 01:08:03.595
Sketches.

01:08:03.627 --> 01:08:05.164
Trivialities,

01:08:05.196 --> 01:08:06.397
love poems.

01:08:06.432 --> 01:08:09.667
Then why are you here in the
federal gallows of the Emperor?

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.702
I mean, surely, those trite
words couldn't have plagued

01:08:11.736 --> 01:08:14.272
the ear of His Eminence,
Caesar Augustus.

01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:17.841
Well... it wasn't that.

01:08:21.312 --> 01:08:24.314
You've heard of
Augustus' moral reforms?

01:08:24.348 --> 01:08:25.816
How could I not?

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:27.453
Well, I wrote a book.

01:08:28.919 --> 01:08:31.288
An instruction manual...

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:33.425
so to speak.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:36.495
And... it was on
the art of love.

01:08:38.629 --> 01:08:45.435
Our armies... burning and
pillaging villages out west.

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:50.441
Our slaves and our farmers
dying of plague and famine.

01:08:50.475 --> 01:08:54.379
But Augustus decides to
reestablish Roman virtues

01:08:54.412 --> 01:08:56.247
and family values.

01:08:59.015 --> 01:09:02.220
I included a section on
how to have a love affair.

01:09:04.388 --> 01:09:05.856
And his daughter,
one Julia the Elder,

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:07.825
is exiled for philandering.

01:09:10.028 --> 01:09:11.229
So that was you.

01:09:13.265 --> 01:09:14.700
So you have heard of me?

01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:21.372
Who, then, my inquisitive
friend, are you?

01:09:21.404 --> 01:09:25.211
Julia, paging one Julia!

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.814
Well, then.

01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:33.651
I am one Julia the Younger.

01:09:34.285 --> 01:09:35.386
Oh.

01:09:35.419 --> 01:09:37.256
Granddaughter
to my jailer,

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:42.328
daughter... to the exiled Julia.

01:09:46.064 --> 01:09:48.533
Julia,
one Julia the Younger,

01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:51.403
granddaughter or His
Eminence, Caesar Augustus,

01:09:51.435 --> 01:09:53.939
will you please
report to the gate!

01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:00.980
Family connections aren't
what they used to be.

01:10:19.096 --> 01:10:22.300
That will be 500 aureus.

01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:25.703
Weren't you that
prized Augustan recruit?

01:10:25.736 --> 01:10:27.806
Yeah, yeah, I was.

01:10:27.838 --> 01:10:31.309
You are lucky to get
away with just a fine.

01:10:31.342 --> 01:10:33.711
Someone may have
been looking out for you.

01:10:33.744 --> 01:10:36.448
For treason, you could
be sentenced to death.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.415
Treason?

01:10:37.882 --> 01:10:38.982
Death?

01:10:39.016 --> 01:10:41.753
Well, you do know what
the charges are, don't you?

01:10:48.059 --> 01:10:49.727
Ovid, darling.

01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:52.431
Ugh, darling Nose,
where have you been?

01:10:52.463 --> 01:10:54.732
Ugh, you
had me so worried.

01:10:54.766 --> 01:10:57.369
You really do need to stop
saying such treasonable things.

01:10:57.401 --> 01:10:58.403
Promoting love
affairs and stuff.

01:10:58.436 --> 01:11:00.805
You're gonna make
Emperor Augustus furious.

01:11:00.838 --> 01:11:02.707
You wouldn't want to
worry me, now, would you?

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.544
Well... should we stop
doing what we're doing?

01:11:06.578 --> 01:11:07.913
What?

01:11:07.945 --> 01:11:09.814
Nobody knows what we're doing.

01:11:13.551 --> 01:11:14.986
What do you know about Juliet?

01:11:15.019 --> 01:11:16.722
Who?

01:11:16.754 --> 01:11:18.757
Julia the Younger,
Augustus' granddaughter.

01:11:18.789 --> 01:11:20.591
- Ugh...
- What do you know about her?

01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:21.693
Ovid, how should I know?

01:11:21.726 --> 01:11:23.662
Would you stop talking
about politics all the time?

01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:26.365
Everybody is so bent out
about politics these days.

01:11:26.397 --> 01:11:27.932
I hear these veterans
are thinking about rioting

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:31.503
because... something about
lacking food and no benefits.

01:11:31.535 --> 01:11:33.137
But we're in a time of peace
and prosperity right now.

01:11:33.171 --> 01:11:35.640
There's no wars going on.

01:11:35.672 --> 01:11:39.143
So... what do you know
about Julia the Younger?

01:11:40.378 --> 01:11:41.913
I know that she's
connected to some sort of

01:11:41.945 --> 01:11:43.582
political opposition.

01:11:44.848 --> 01:11:46.551
And Augustus knows about this?

01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:49.720
Ovid, how would I know if
Augustus knows about it or not?

01:11:49.753 --> 01:11:51.390
Now, stop being a bore.

01:11:51.422 --> 01:11:52.790
- Come to bed.
- I thought being a bore was

01:11:52.824 --> 01:11:54.793
something you accused
your husband of being.

01:11:54.825 --> 01:11:56.060
Well, it is.

01:11:56.093 --> 01:11:58.829
But I was forced to marry him.

01:11:58.863 --> 01:12:00.632
And with you, it's a choice.

01:12:05.736 --> 01:12:08.140
You know this is
an exilable offense?

01:12:09.207 --> 01:12:10.642
Then exile me.

01:12:30.462 --> 01:12:32.830
Excuse me.

01:12:32.864 --> 01:12:35.434
I'm sorry, but you
can't sleep here.

01:12:35.467 --> 01:12:37.669
And the library
closes in half an hour.

01:12:37.702 --> 01:12:39.437
Budget cuts.

01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:41.940
You'll have to
finish up and hurry up.

01:12:50.781 --> 01:12:54.752
<i>And as I speak, time
flies and the years do pass.</i>

01:13:08.165 --> 01:13:09.534
Psst!

01:13:09.566 --> 01:13:10.468
Julia!

01:13:11.769 --> 01:13:12.870
It's me, Ovid!

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:14.905
We met...

01:13:14.939 --> 01:13:18.709
We met under not the best
of circumstances years ago.

01:13:18.743 --> 01:13:21.213
By which you mean
federal prison?

01:13:21.245 --> 01:13:23.013
Well, yes, but...
and before that!

01:13:23.047 --> 01:13:23.781
Shh!

01:13:26.751 --> 01:13:29.488
Do you realize how much
trouble we could get into

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.988
if we were seen here together?

01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:32.824
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

01:13:33.525 --> 01:13:34.526
Why?

01:13:35.693 --> 01:13:37.195
Well...

01:13:37.227 --> 01:13:40.132
I guess I've always seen
something different in you.

01:13:42.534 --> 01:13:46.071
By which you mean I am the
Emperor's granddaughter,

01:13:46.104 --> 01:13:48.272
all of which would grant
you connections beyond

01:13:48.306 --> 01:13:49.774
your wildest dreams.

01:13:49.806 --> 01:13:51.642
Except he wants me dead.

01:13:52.209 --> 01:13:53.011
No.

01:13:53.811 --> 01:13:55.180
Your wit.

01:13:55.212 --> 01:13:57.882
And your intellect.

01:13:57.915 --> 01:14:01.785
And I believe you are involved
in an anti-despotic organization

01:14:01.819 --> 01:14:04.256
in which I may
have some interest.

01:14:04.288 --> 01:14:07.791
I hope this isn't some pickup
technique promoted in your most

01:14:07.824 --> 01:14:10.561
popular and controversial tome.

01:14:10.595 --> 01:14:11.796
I have read it, you know.

01:14:11.829 --> 01:14:14.164
Did you ever know me to advise
picking up a lady by gaining

01:14:14.198 --> 01:14:16.767
access to a top-secret
political organization?

01:14:16.801 --> 01:14:17.936
No,

01:14:17.968 --> 01:14:20.771
but you do realize that this
is a treasonable offense?

01:14:20.805 --> 01:14:21.972
Both our heads are
under surveillance.

01:14:22.006 --> 01:14:24.976
No, no, no no, I have given
up my instructions on love.

01:14:25.008 --> 01:14:26.912
- I've become a clean man!
- Shh!

01:14:33.851 --> 01:14:36.087
No longer challenging authority?

01:14:36.119 --> 01:14:38.088
What do you want with me, then?

01:14:38.122 --> 01:14:40.258
I told you.

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:42.894
I'm not after love.

01:14:42.927 --> 01:14:45.864
Then you do realize the
depths of danger you'll be

01:14:45.896 --> 01:14:47.698
sinking into.

01:14:47.731 --> 01:14:49.967
My grandfather, for instance,

01:14:50.001 --> 01:14:52.704
saw a general taking notes,

01:14:52.736 --> 01:14:55.006
had him stabbed on the spot,

01:14:55.038 --> 01:14:56.974
thinking him a spy.

01:14:57.007 --> 01:14:58.742
These are tough times,

01:14:58.775 --> 01:15:00.912
and Augustus will
take brutal precautions.

01:15:00.945 --> 01:15:03.114
- Have you read my latest work?
- Are you listening to me?

01:15:03.146 --> 01:15:06.283
- I swear this is not a...
- I have read your manual

01:15:06.316 --> 01:15:07.752
on love, yes.

01:15:07.784 --> 01:15:10.721
No, have you read
my latest work?

01:15:10.754 --> 01:15:12.623
Another triviality.

01:15:12.656 --> 01:15:14.693
It's about old myths.

01:15:14.726 --> 01:15:18.663
Stories of people changing,
beasts becoming men,

01:15:18.695 --> 01:15:20.332
gods becoming beasts.

01:15:21.665 --> 01:15:23.302
Gods becoming beasts?

01:15:24.936 --> 01:15:26.638
That sounds a bit
heretical.

01:15:29.406 --> 01:15:33.145
Meet me at the corner of
Yvlavia at nine tonight.

01:15:41.653 --> 01:15:44.122
So you were able to distribute
the grain to the encampments

01:15:44.154 --> 01:15:44.989
by the Forum?

01:15:45.022 --> 01:15:45.790
Yes, I was.

01:15:45.824 --> 01:15:47.726
And thank you for
those resources.

01:15:47.758 --> 01:15:48.726
Thank you!

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.663
We will be in touch when
the new supplies arrive.

01:15:51.695 --> 01:15:53.265
- 'Til then.
- 'Til then.

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:56.801
So...

01:15:56.833 --> 01:16:00.738
whom, my sister, have
you brought this time?

01:16:00.771 --> 01:16:02.707
This is the poet Ovid.

01:16:02.739 --> 01:16:04.141
I've heard of you.

01:16:04.175 --> 01:16:05.810
A few people have.

01:16:05.842 --> 01:16:07.345
Modest.

01:16:07.378 --> 01:16:10.782
People seek out your
love poems far and wide.

01:16:10.815 --> 01:16:13.218
We met in prison.

01:16:14.252 --> 01:16:15.687
Ovid...

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.056
this is my brother,
Agrippa Postumus.

01:16:18.088 --> 01:16:19.289
Weren't you exiled?

01:16:19.323 --> 01:16:20.925
I was.

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:23.795
You know, I may have used some,
uh, advice from your book,

01:16:23.828 --> 01:16:25.096
<i>Ars Amatoria,</i>

01:16:25.128 --> 01:16:28.033
to help placate my wife
during our separation.

01:16:29.132 --> 01:16:31.702
Our grandfather had him exiled

01:16:31.735 --> 01:16:34.305
under the pretense that
my brother's bad temper

01:16:34.337 --> 01:16:36.073
could somehow hurt the Empire.

01:16:36.106 --> 01:16:37.975
He was no doubt under
the influence of our

01:16:38.008 --> 01:16:39.677
step-grandmother Livia

01:16:39.711 --> 01:16:41.945
and our step-father Tiberius,

01:16:41.979 --> 01:16:45.050
who have plans to seize
power once Augustus is gone.

01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:47.118
Now, all of this is
top secret, of course.

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:48.952
Of course.

01:16:48.985 --> 01:16:51.823
So, with a network
of army officials,

01:16:51.855 --> 01:16:54.324
we snuck my brother
back into Rome

01:16:54.357 --> 01:16:56.093
to help us with our activities.

01:16:56.127 --> 01:16:57.796
And...

01:16:57.829 --> 01:17:00.098
what, may I ask,
are your activities?

01:17:01.265 --> 01:17:02.432
Do we trust him?

01:17:02.466 --> 01:17:05.003
He was the one person who
managed to drive Gramps Augustus

01:17:05.035 --> 01:17:06.370
into a rage

01:17:06.404 --> 01:17:08.973
when no one else
could get to him.

01:17:09.006 --> 01:17:12.843
There are some of us, including
our dear mother, who no one has

01:17:12.877 --> 01:17:15.013
heard from in years,

01:17:15.046 --> 01:17:17.981
who believe the Republic
should truly be restored.

01:17:18.015 --> 01:17:20.952
Yeah, instead of whatever
figurehead institution

01:17:20.985 --> 01:17:23.088
we have now under the
guise of Roman values.

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.024
We believe elections and
Senators will more fully

01:17:26.056 --> 01:17:28.158
represent our nation.

01:17:28.191 --> 01:17:30.729
But by taking this position,
you would end your own

01:17:30.762 --> 01:17:32.397
hereditary line.

01:17:33.396 --> 01:17:34.932
Yeah, we know.

01:17:38.235 --> 01:17:40.004
So why are you doing this?

01:17:43.908 --> 01:17:45.444
Would you like to take a walk?

01:18:37.195 --> 01:18:38.196
This way.

01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:39.131
Come on.

01:19:25.376 --> 01:19:26.977
D... do nothing to us!

01:19:27.011 --> 01:19:28.245
We don't want no trouble!

01:19:28.279 --> 01:19:29.848
We are good people.

01:19:29.881 --> 01:19:31.316
I swear.

01:19:31.348 --> 01:19:32.984
- We worked with...
- We're not gonna do anything.

01:19:33.016 --> 01:19:34.084
- For some 20 years...
- No, no, no.

01:19:34.118 --> 01:19:36.521
- Before it shut down.
- We're not the government.

01:19:36.553 --> 01:19:38.388
I swear, we're just
looking for Crispus, okay?

01:19:38.422 --> 01:19:40.425
We're friends... we're friendly.

01:19:41.258 --> 01:19:43.528
Crispus?

01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:46.064
Well, he... he's down
in the main settlement.

01:19:49.165 --> 01:19:51.269
Can you please be
careful of my husband?

01:19:51.302 --> 01:19:53.305
He's... sleeping.

01:20:11.422 --> 01:20:12.424
Polus?

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.863
Where is my man Polus?

01:20:18.962 --> 01:20:19.864
Polus?

01:20:21.198 --> 01:20:22.133
I can't sleep.

01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:23.967
I need Polus.

01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:25.403
I don't know, my love.

01:20:25.436 --> 01:20:26.905
Why don't you come back to bed?

01:20:26.937 --> 01:20:28.172
I... I can't sleep.

01:20:28.204 --> 01:20:31.475
It's unrest over the
grain shortage and...

01:20:31.508 --> 01:20:33.011
Polus!

01:20:33.043 --> 01:20:34.011
Damn it!

01:20:34.044 --> 01:20:35.178
Where are you?

01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:37.649
Polus!

01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:42.119
Polus!

01:20:47.223 --> 01:20:48.693
My Lord...

01:20:48.726 --> 01:20:50.428
I think I've found him.

01:20:57.501 --> 01:20:58.637
Polus?

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.142
Polus?

01:21:08.346 --> 01:21:09.915
Polus!

01:21:11.548 --> 01:21:13.618
This
is not your wife!

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:14.618
I thought you
were sleeping, sir.

01:21:14.651 --> 01:21:16.087
You thought I was sleeping?

01:21:16.119 --> 01:21:17.988
- Yes, sir.
- Polus...

01:21:19.123 --> 01:21:21.059
this will mean death.

01:21:21.092 --> 01:21:22.493
Oh, s...

01:21:22.525 --> 01:21:24.662
- Surely, you must be kidding.
- Yes, death!

01:21:24.695 --> 01:21:27.365
I cannot and I will not tolerate

01:21:27.397 --> 01:21:30.968
disobedience from even
within my own home.

01:21:31.002 --> 01:21:32.102
Take him!

01:21:32.136 --> 01:21:34.672
Whoa whoa whoa, wait, wait!

01:21:34.704 --> 01:21:36.341
Surely, you must
be kidding, sir.

01:21:36.373 --> 01:21:37.474
Everybody's doing
it these days!

01:21:37.507 --> 01:21:39.577
Senators, officers...

01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:42.647
why, even Ovid,
Roma's most popular poet.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.249
He's giving advice on
how to have a love affair.

01:21:45.281 --> 01:21:46.284
Yes!

01:21:48.552 --> 01:21:49.620
Take him!

01:21:49.653 --> 01:21:52.522
No, wait, no! No!

01:21:52.556 --> 01:21:53.591
No!

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:56.328
No!

01:22:46.342 --> 01:22:48.712
It's so nice.

01:22:48.745 --> 01:22:51.216
In this city, there
will always be life.

01:22:55.453 --> 01:22:59.057
So have you been allied
with the encampment for long?

01:22:59.089 --> 01:23:02.726
I try to do what
I can to divert grain.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:06.329
What we really need is a
change in governing system.

01:23:06.363 --> 01:23:07.731
I mean, right now,

01:23:07.765 --> 01:23:09.232
all of our money's
filtered through Augustus.

01:23:09.266 --> 01:23:10.334
Fuck grain handouts.

01:23:10.367 --> 01:23:12.302
We want jobs.

01:23:12.336 --> 01:23:14.372
That's right,
fuck grain handouts.

01:23:14.404 --> 01:23:15.773
They want jobs.

01:23:18.809 --> 01:23:20.110
Big project.

01:23:21.645 --> 01:23:23.114
People are organizing.

01:23:24.214 --> 01:23:25.182
But yes.

01:23:29.653 --> 01:23:31.689
- Crispus!
- Julia.

01:23:31.721 --> 01:23:33.356
This is Ovid.

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:34.459
Ah.

01:23:34.492 --> 01:23:36.260
<i>Ars Armetoria.</i>

01:23:36.293 --> 01:23:38.129
- <i>The Art of Love.</i>
- Yes.

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:51.176
So, you're viewing
our encampment.

01:23:53.843 --> 01:23:55.446
Uemployment's bad.

01:23:56.379 --> 01:23:57.481
I understand that.

01:24:19.302 --> 01:24:21.838
Since soldiers
returned from war,

01:24:21.872 --> 01:24:23.775
came back to close
down the mills.

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:28.745
Oh my gods.

01:24:31.414 --> 01:24:32.382
Look!

01:24:34.318 --> 01:24:37.888
Such talent.

01:24:37.922 --> 01:24:39.190
Wow.

01:24:42.825 --> 01:24:44.229
Such joy.

01:25:02.479 --> 01:25:04.449
So what have you
been working on lately?

01:25:06.283 --> 01:25:07.352
Old myths.

01:25:08.918 --> 01:25:11.488
Metamorphosis.

01:25:11.521 --> 01:25:14.458
You know, Apollo chasing
Daphne 'til she becomes a tree.

01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:16.593
Wait...

01:25:16.627 --> 01:25:20.664
you wrote the latest version
of Daphne turning into a tree?

01:25:20.698 --> 01:25:21.699
Yes.

01:25:21.731 --> 01:25:23.367
So I'm told.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.204
What my pen and paper
seem to suggest.

01:25:26.236 --> 01:25:30.207
Wait, so Daphne
and Apollo, that's you?

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.341
We aim to please.

01:25:31.374 --> 01:25:33.476
- It's my latest work.
- Oh my gods.

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:36.446
So then you wrote that line
that Daphne yells at Apollo?

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.784
"If I cannot be your wife, then
I can certainly be your tree?"

01:25:39.816 --> 01:25:40.850
Oh!

01:25:40.883 --> 01:25:43.620
My gods, I love that line!

01:25:43.654 --> 01:25:45.356
And when she's...

01:25:45.388 --> 01:25:48.292
she's turning into a tree and...

01:25:48.324 --> 01:25:51.761
and she just wants to be
something for him, ugh...

01:25:51.794 --> 01:25:54.998
I mean, I can really
relate to that.

01:25:55.031 --> 01:25:57.267
Ugh, yeah...

01:26:00.803 --> 01:26:02.806
Shall we continue to the tracks?

01:26:39.776 --> 01:26:40.811
Careful.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.749
That could be a
treasonable offense.

01:26:46.617 --> 01:26:48.019
You're married?

01:26:48.052 --> 01:26:50.955
I told you that the
first time we met.

01:26:50.988 --> 01:26:52.990
To Lucius Aemilius Paullus.

01:26:53.856 --> 01:26:54.757
Yes.

01:26:54.792 --> 01:26:57.462
So you do remember
the first time we met.

01:26:58.561 --> 01:27:00.497
It was long before prison.

01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:01.698
Yes.

01:27:01.731 --> 01:27:03.301
It occurred to me.

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:05.403
By the water fountain.

01:27:05.436 --> 01:27:06.638
I was rude.

01:27:09.772 --> 01:27:11.876
You set me on my path.

01:27:11.909 --> 01:27:14.812
You know, I used some of what
you told me in my <i>Art of Love.</i>

01:27:16.346 --> 01:27:17.047
Really?

01:27:18.915 --> 01:27:20.318
- Hm.
- What are the chances?

01:27:31.628 --> 01:27:33.597
Well, putting my arm on your
shoulder may be treasonous,

01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:36.700
but perhaps dancing is not?

01:27:36.734 --> 01:27:38.803
No, dancing is not.

01:27:44.807 --> 01:27:46.343
Your Ladyship.

01:28:03.025 --> 01:28:04.961
Do it for your country!

01:28:09.031 --> 01:28:10.334
Do it.

01:29:13.463 --> 01:29:15.031
Do you think
he'd do it to us?

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:20.704
I don't know.

01:29:22.138 --> 01:29:24.475
He's becoming
increasingly paranoid.

01:29:27.244 --> 01:29:28.679
I heard he m...

01:29:28.712 --> 01:29:30.748
he made his man Polus...

01:29:33.749 --> 01:29:35.785
he forced him...

01:29:35.819 --> 01:29:37.422
to commit suic...

01:29:42.758 --> 01:29:44.462
Tell me a story.

01:29:46.163 --> 01:29:47.732
About what?

01:29:48.832 --> 01:29:50.968
Sh... should we even be talking?

01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:53.537
Just anything, just...

01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:55.106
recount one of your tales.

01:30:03.881 --> 01:30:07.685
Of bodies changed to
various forms I sing.

01:30:10.553 --> 01:30:14.158
Ye gods, from whom
these miracles spring.

01:30:18.695 --> 01:30:21.132
I think Livia and
Tiberius are vengeful.

01:30:21.931 --> 01:30:23.132
What?

01:30:23.167 --> 01:30:28.905
Livia, my step-grandmother,
and Tiberius, my step-father.

01:30:28.939 --> 01:30:30.040
They're vengeful!

01:30:30.908 --> 01:30:32.776
I think...

01:30:32.809 --> 01:30:35.178
they want us dead so
they can accede to power.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.781
Shh.

01:30:46.155 --> 01:30:47.725
Pyramus...

01:30:48.824 --> 01:30:50.193
and Thisbe...

01:30:51.828 --> 01:30:52.763
one...

01:30:54.698 --> 01:30:56.566
a beautiful young man...

01:30:57.734 --> 01:30:59.770
the other...

01:30:59.802 --> 01:31:04.107
the most preferred of girls
in the Eastern world...

01:31:05.842 --> 01:31:07.979
occupied neighboring houses...

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.682
ruled by an Assyrian queen.

01:31:15.284 --> 01:31:17.220
Their proximity...

01:31:17.253 --> 01:31:18.989
caused their acquaintance...

01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:22.859
and their first steps of love.

01:31:26.128 --> 01:31:27.097
Their love...

01:31:29.132 --> 01:31:30.902
increased in time.

01:31:33.235 --> 01:31:35.839
They would have joined together
in the bonds of marriage...

01:31:41.878 --> 01:31:43.848
but their parents forbid it.

01:31:50.753 --> 01:31:53.056
That's from your poem,
"Metamorphosise."

01:31:57.761 --> 01:31:58.796
Yes.

01:32:09.038 --> 01:32:13.209
Please, forgive the
rough treatment, Julia.

01:32:13.243 --> 01:32:15.312
At least give us
a fair hearing...

01:32:16.178 --> 01:32:17.614
Grandfather.

01:32:33.195 --> 01:32:36.867
Did you not compare
our noble Roman army

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.168
to a lover,

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:42.006
when I had explicitly
outlawed affair?

01:32:43.039 --> 01:32:44.040
I'm not sure.

01:32:44.074 --> 01:32:46.010
Didn't I recruit you...

01:32:46.043 --> 01:32:48.178
into our government?

01:32:48.211 --> 01:32:52.181
I'm speaking to you,
Publius Ovidius Naso!

01:32:52.214 --> 01:32:52.882
Yes.

01:32:52.915 --> 01:32:56.086
And what have you done for me?

01:32:56.119 --> 01:32:57.688
Do you like witty poetry?

01:32:58.721 --> 01:33:01.425
Need I remind you, Ovid,

01:33:01.458 --> 01:33:03.127
that I am the Emperor?

01:33:05.195 --> 01:33:07.064
Yo, I got you, J.

01:33:07.096 --> 01:33:09.332
I rounded up a bunch
of peeps from my youth.

01:33:09.365 --> 01:33:11.668
- You'll see.
- Thank you, Cornelia.

01:33:11.702 --> 01:33:13.671
From your "Amores:"

01:33:13.704 --> 01:33:18.075
"All lovers are
soldiers, believe me.

01:33:18.107 --> 01:33:21.811
A gallant
soldier besieges cities,

01:33:21.845 --> 01:33:24.815
a lover, his mistress' house.

01:33:24.847 --> 01:33:29.218
One breaks down the gates,
the other, household doors.

01:33:29.252 --> 01:33:33.957
Find them unarmed and
slaughter..." I can't.

01:33:33.989 --> 01:33:37.827
You do realize that
this is our army,

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:39.997
under gods we trust,

01:33:40.029 --> 01:33:41.698
that you've compared?

01:33:41.731 --> 01:33:44.767
The army that brought
peace back into this land,

01:33:44.801 --> 01:33:47.870
that restored the
Republic that defends us

01:33:47.904 --> 01:33:51.241
against the Anglo-Saxons
and the Gauls...

01:33:51.274 --> 01:33:54.811
and the uncouth barbarians
that ravage our borders!

01:33:54.845 --> 01:33:58.481
I... I do, Your Eminence.

01:33:58.515 --> 01:34:01.718
- I said they were gallant.
- What was that?

01:34:01.752 --> 01:34:04.988
Y... you do remember you're on
trial here for seditious acts?

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:07.757
In addition to that,
you've likened fornication

01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:09.959
to our very judicial system.

01:34:09.993 --> 01:34:12.396
Cornelia.

01:34:12.428 --> 01:34:14.832
"If sex is equally
pleasing to both partners,

01:34:14.864 --> 01:34:17.100
why should one
sell sex and buy it?

01:34:17.133 --> 01:34:21.270
It is unethical for witnesses
to sell false testimony.

01:34:21.303 --> 01:34:23.006
It is unethical for judges to..."

01:34:23.038 --> 01:34:25.274
If the defense may interject?

01:34:25.307 --> 01:34:29.011
In defense of my client, there
is no actual proof in either

01:34:29.044 --> 01:34:32.382
of those examples that the
defendant was promoting...

01:34:32.414 --> 01:34:36.519
copulation
with a married woman.

01:34:36.552 --> 01:34:40.022
In fact, he seems to be
arguing against prostitution,

01:34:40.056 --> 01:34:42.860
which I do believe
is a Roman value.

01:34:42.892 --> 01:34:45.895
I believe my father-in-law
has no interest

01:34:45.928 --> 01:34:48.030
in the well-being
of prostitutes,

01:34:48.064 --> 01:34:52.168
only in making sure that the
sanctity of marriage is upheld

01:34:52.202 --> 01:34:55.271
and that we're not undermining
any of the institutions

01:34:55.305 --> 01:34:57.173
which make this state great,

01:34:57.207 --> 01:35:00.310
an offense which is worthy
of capital punishment,

01:35:00.342 --> 01:35:02.145
death.

01:35:02.178 --> 01:35:04.248
Ah, yes, here it is.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.118
"My sexual desires
accommodate all of history.

01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:10.287
The young arouse me,

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.190
those of a later
age... touch me.

01:35:13.222 --> 01:35:15.493
All live in the city.

01:35:16.359 --> 01:35:17.995
I crave them.

01:35:18.928 --> 01:35:19.963
Everyone."

01:35:19.997 --> 01:35:24.534
Can you define the word
"everyone," please, Ovid?

01:35:24.568 --> 01:35:29.071
Wouldn't the word...
"everyone" include married

01:35:29.105 --> 01:35:31.942
as well as unmarried women?

01:35:31.975 --> 01:35:33.209
Well, yes.

01:35:33.243 --> 01:35:35.579
- But...
- Yes, but what?

01:35:35.611 --> 01:35:38.080
I think you've just
admitted to the fact

01:35:38.114 --> 01:35:40.117
that when you have an
interest in sexual relations

01:35:40.150 --> 01:35:41.118
with a woman,

01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:46.088
that they are sometimes,
if not often, married.

01:35:46.122 --> 01:35:48.825
- Well, yes, but...
- But what?

01:35:48.859 --> 01:35:50.494
Your Eminence, the defendant
would like a chance

01:35:50.526 --> 01:35:52.829
to speak if he might?

01:35:52.863 --> 01:35:54.865
Very well.

01:35:54.897 --> 01:35:57.034
This better be good.

01:36:01.137 --> 01:36:04.174
Have any of you read my
latest work, Metamorphosise?

01:36:04.207 --> 01:36:06.543
Perhaps some of
your esteemed family

01:36:06.575 --> 01:36:10.079
might remember the story
of Daphne and Apollo.

01:36:10.113 --> 01:36:12.481
Well, in it, as
some of you remember,

01:36:12.515 --> 01:36:16.485
Apollo chases the beautiful
Daphne through the woods.

01:36:16.519 --> 01:36:20.623
And the virginal nymph, however,
wished nothing to do with him.

01:36:20.656 --> 01:36:26.128
But the god became so
enflamed with desire,

01:36:26.162 --> 01:36:28.999
his heart burned so for her,

01:36:29.031 --> 01:36:33.270
that he chased her and
chased her, over brooks,

01:36:33.302 --> 01:36:36.539
through the woods,
under brambles until...

01:36:38.574 --> 01:36:40.144
her soft skin...

01:36:41.278 --> 01:36:42.879
became bark...

01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.348
and her arms...

01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:48.886
branches...

01:36:48.918 --> 01:36:51.020
and her curly locks...

01:36:51.053 --> 01:36:54.091
twisted into dark green foliage.

01:36:55.357 --> 01:36:57.328
She had turned into a tree.

01:36:59.162 --> 01:37:01.198
Now, surely, you don't therefore
assume that I advocate

01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:03.032
turning all women
into hard wood.

01:37:03.065 --> 01:37:04.400
Order!

01:37:04.434 --> 01:37:05.435
Okay.

01:37:05.467 --> 01:37:06.502
Please.

01:37:06.535 --> 01:37:10.573
Have you no respect for
the dignity of this state?

01:37:10.606 --> 01:37:13.542
Apologies for the humor,
Your Divine Eminence.

01:37:13.575 --> 01:37:14.511
But...

01:37:14.543 --> 01:37:16.913
the defendant has given
up on writing poems

01:37:16.946 --> 01:37:19.449
such as <i>Ars Armetoria,
The Art of Love</i>,

01:37:19.481 --> 01:37:22.185
which some people perceive
to be promoting love affairs,

01:37:22.217 --> 01:37:25.922
and have moved on to works
such as <i>Metamorphosise,</i>

01:37:25.955 --> 01:37:28.057
the collection of myths
from around the world,

01:37:28.091 --> 01:37:31.261
and which includes sections
about our national hero,

01:37:31.293 --> 01:37:32.328
- Aeneas.
- How?

01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:36.300
How can you talk
about hard wood,

01:37:36.333 --> 01:37:40.103
when our very nation faces
the gravest of moral crises?

01:37:40.136 --> 01:37:41.238
Grandfather, if
I may interject...

01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:42.338
This is unbelievable.

01:37:42.372 --> 01:37:46.409
Have we no more sanctity
or respect for our leaders?

01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:49.579
Does the blessing of
Jupiter mean nothing?

01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:51.347
Grandfather!

01:37:54.484 --> 01:37:55.552
What is this?

01:37:55.584 --> 01:37:56.953
Lepidus!

01:37:56.986 --> 01:37:59.288
Lepidus, get the guards!

01:37:59.321 --> 01:38:02.191
We cannot have a
mob against us here!

01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:10.100
Grandfather,
if I may speak...

01:38:12.267 --> 01:38:14.671
Now, you do realize
that you are here

01:38:14.704 --> 01:38:18.375
under trial for seditious acts?

01:38:18.408 --> 01:38:21.144
- I don't think...
- You do not think what?

01:38:21.177 --> 01:38:23.614
I don't think you
should execute this man.

01:38:25.015 --> 01:38:25.582
Why?

01:38:25.615 --> 01:38:28.118
What's your interest?

01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:31.988
Have you been fornicating with
him, just like your mother?

01:38:33.155 --> 01:38:35.691
My interest in it is yours.

01:38:35.725 --> 01:38:38.562
Don't let your family
ties sway you, Augustus.

01:38:38.595 --> 01:38:40.664
You know she is her
mother's daughter.

01:38:40.696 --> 01:38:42.132
Grandfather...

01:38:42.164 --> 01:38:43.734
you know about
the growing unrest

01:38:43.766 --> 01:38:45.267
in the encampments
because of

01:38:45.301 --> 01:38:46.669
- the current grain shortage.
- Of course I do.

01:38:46.703 --> 01:38:48.437
Augustus...

01:38:48.471 --> 01:38:50.574
Well, if you wish
to maintain power,

01:38:50.606 --> 01:38:53.409
I do not believe it the
wisest choice in time

01:38:53.443 --> 01:38:57.213
to execute the country's
most popular poet.

01:38:57.247 --> 01:39:00.584
Besides being a favorite
of the people, the Senators,

01:39:00.617 --> 01:39:03.453
on whose support you also rely,

01:39:03.485 --> 01:39:06.155
very much favor this writer.

01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:09.026
And you know the thin line that
you walk with the Senators.

01:39:09.059 --> 01:39:10.293
Augustus!

01:39:14.196 --> 01:39:17.066
Why... why are you
saying these things?

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:22.606
You know that there is
rumor of your...

01:39:22.638 --> 01:39:25.208
traitorous actions.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.444
Perhaps...

01:39:27.476 --> 01:39:30.113
I am interested
in your well-being.

01:39:33.850 --> 01:39:35.419
Do you remember...

01:39:35.452 --> 01:39:38.387
that bronze helmet that
you gave to me as a child?

01:39:38.421 --> 01:39:40.757
Your Eminence, if the
second defense may?

01:39:40.789 --> 01:39:42.725
Let her speak.

01:39:42.758 --> 01:39:45.227
You brought it
back from Egypt...

01:39:45.261 --> 01:39:48.098
from your battle
against Mark Antony.

01:39:49.332 --> 01:39:51.668
I still have it.

01:39:59.809 --> 01:40:01.311
Take her away.

01:40:03.812 --> 01:40:05.781
Grandfather!

01:40:05.815 --> 01:40:10.521
I keep it under my bed
in my small, modest room!

01:40:22.832 --> 01:40:24.468
I can't take her anymore.

01:40:27.803 --> 01:40:29.373
This trial is adjourned.

01:40:31.673 --> 01:40:33.542
Bring the prisoners
into the courtyard

01:40:33.575 --> 01:40:35.745
and let them
roam free.

01:40:37.913 --> 01:40:39.882
Death...

01:40:39.915 --> 01:40:43.287
is not an appropriate
punishment for either of them.

01:40:47.556 --> 01:40:49.258
Tiberius...

01:40:49.292 --> 01:40:51.361
It's gonna be okay, bro.

01:40:51.394 --> 01:40:53.864
Daytime and nighttime
persona got your back!

01:40:56.533 --> 01:40:57.301
Hey.

01:41:04.306 --> 01:41:06.242
Well...

01:41:06.275 --> 01:41:07.810
we're off for now.

01:41:07.843 --> 01:41:10.646
We might as well enjoy
our moment of freedom.

01:41:15.752 --> 01:41:17.788
Julia, Your Eminence,

01:41:19.355 --> 01:41:22.459
I cannot thank you enough.

01:41:26.329 --> 01:41:27.931
It's okay.

01:41:27.963 --> 01:41:29.698
You know, um...

01:41:29.731 --> 01:41:31.368
you being there...

01:41:32.735 --> 01:41:35.939
you, uh... allowed
me to show

01:41:35.971 --> 01:41:40.176
that I still care
for my grandfather.

01:41:40.209 --> 01:41:41.145
- So...
- That's right.

01:41:41.177 --> 01:41:43.712
I am, as always, the
hero of the situation.

01:41:45.347 --> 01:41:48.484
Bringing families
together since 10 BCE.

01:41:49.753 --> 01:41:51.955
After all, was I not the one
to advocate turning our divine

01:41:51.988 --> 01:41:54.490
Roman ladies into trees?

01:41:54.524 --> 01:41:56.825
Mm. Yeah.

01:41:56.859 --> 01:41:59.963
An admirable position, really.

01:41:59.995 --> 01:42:03.600
This could solve the fundamental
problems of the Republic.

01:42:05.635 --> 01:42:08.305
Did I say
that too loud?

01:42:12.542 --> 01:42:14.278
What was it like
growing up here?

01:42:15.511 --> 01:42:16.847
I didn't really grow up here.

01:42:18.248 --> 01:42:19.516
No, I want to know.

01:42:19.548 --> 01:42:21.484
Just give me bits.

01:42:21.516 --> 01:42:23.252
Highlights from your childhood.

01:42:24.486 --> 01:42:25.521
Highlights...

01:42:26.655 --> 01:42:27.857
I don't know anything.

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.495
Actually, um...

01:42:33.529 --> 01:42:36.999
when we would
visit with my mother,

01:42:37.033 --> 01:42:41.471
I did go down to
the store room, and...

01:42:41.503 --> 01:42:44.306
my brother and I would play hide
and seek among the barrels.

01:42:49.846 --> 01:42:51.915
I bet we could
go down there now.

01:42:51.948 --> 01:42:53.516
Should we?

01:42:53.548 --> 01:42:54.917
I mean, are we allowed?

01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:56.720
What is he gonna do?

01:42:56.753 --> 01:42:58.822
Hang Rome's favorite
poet just for looking

01:42:58.855 --> 01:43:00.624
at his wine collection?

01:43:03.426 --> 01:43:04.727
Come on.

01:43:29.686 --> 01:43:31.421
So what would you do next?

01:43:31.454 --> 01:43:34.591
If you could write or do
whatever you wanted,

01:43:34.623 --> 01:43:36.325
what would it be?

01:43:36.359 --> 01:43:37.361
Hmm.

01:43:38.761 --> 01:43:40.430
Anything at all.

01:43:40.462 --> 01:43:41.897
Sky's the limit.

01:43:41.931 --> 01:43:44.668
Mount Olympus' dental hygiene.

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.836
- What?
- Yes.

01:43:46.869 --> 01:43:49.439
I would go god by god...

01:43:49.471 --> 01:43:51.707
And I would uncover whether
each god rinses after they eat.

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.742
Mm.

01:43:52.775 --> 01:43:55.545
Picks their teeth and spits.

01:43:55.578 --> 01:43:57.847
I think it'll be an epic really
worthy of any great writer,

01:43:57.879 --> 01:43:59.481
- like Virgil.
- Mm-hm.

01:43:59.515 --> 01:44:02.419
And completely
non-controversial.

01:44:02.452 --> 01:44:03.387
Mm-hm.

01:44:03.419 --> 01:44:06.455
And what, pray tell,
would you do...

01:44:09.391 --> 01:44:10.693
- Grandfather...
- Huh?

01:44:11.593 --> 01:44:12.561
Corinna...

01:44:30.946 --> 01:44:34.351
<i>And that was
the last I ever saw of Julia.</i>

01:44:34.383 --> 01:44:36.886
<i>Augustus exiled her
on the spot.</i>

01:44:36.918 --> 01:44:40.522
<i>The mysterious charge against
Julia the Younger was adultery.</i>

01:44:40.556 --> 01:44:42.892
<i>It was convenient to blame her
for something which her mother</i>

01:44:42.925 --> 01:44:44.761
<i>had already been condemned,</i>

01:44:44.793 --> 01:44:48.064
<i>but I really think Augustus</i>

01:44:48.096 --> 01:44:50.466
<i>Shortly thereafter,
her husband, Paullus,</i>

01:44:50.499 --> 01:44:52.769
<i>was executed for conspiracy.</i>

01:44:52.802 --> 01:44:55.372
<i>I never heard from Julia again.</i>

01:44:55.404 --> 01:44:57.773
<i>Her brother, too, was
murdered shortly after Tiberius</i>

01:44:57.806 --> 01:44:59.742
<i>finally ascended to power.</i>

01:45:07.682 --> 01:45:12.087
<i>make me too much of a martyr,</i>

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.757
<i>Augustus exiled me
on the spot also,</i>

01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:17.060
<i>for</i> Ars Armetoria,

01:45:17.092 --> 01:45:20.629
<i>a poem I had
written years before.</i>

01:45:20.663 --> 01:45:25.435
<i>had grown to love and cherish.</i>

01:46:07.476 --> 01:46:10.078
<i>And I was forced to live with
the uncivilized barbarians</i>

01:46:10.111 --> 01:46:11.181
<i>up north.</i>

01:46:12.714 --> 01:46:14.551
<i>All this for a poem...</i>

01:46:15.150 --> 01:46:16.552
<i>and a mistake.</i>

01:47:18.247 --> 01:47:20.283
<i>The sloping
footpath was travelled</i>

01:47:20.315 --> 01:47:23.252
<i>through the soundless silences.</i>

01:47:23.285 --> 01:47:24.787
<i>Steep,</i>

01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.656
<i>hard to see,</i>

01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:28.958
<i>thick with shadowy darkness.</i>

01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:31.194
<i>And now, she slipped backward,</i>

01:47:31.226 --> 01:47:36.031
<i>to capture and be captured.</i>

01:47:36.065 --> 01:47:37.867
<i>Unlucky...</i>

01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:42.038
<i>she grabs nothing
but the retreating air.</i>

01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:45.307
<i>She has not complained
in any respect at all,</i>

01:47:45.341 --> 01:47:47.944
<i>for what could she complain</i>

01:47:47.976 --> 01:47:50.145
<i>except that she had been loved?</i>
