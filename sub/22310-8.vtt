00:01.627 --> 00:03.210
<i>- Last year,
a competition was created</i>

00:03.254 --> 00:05.587
<i>to test the nation's best
bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.631 --> 00:08.007
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year,</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:10.968
<i>craftsmen from all over the
country and all walks of life</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:13.887
<i>have come forward for their
chance to claim the title.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:15.597
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:15.641 --> 00:16.932
- I want to win!

00:16.976 --> 00:18.392
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.436 --> 00:19.476
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.687
<i>Now the Forge returns</i>

00:21.731 --> 00:24.940
<i>with challenges unlike anything
ever seen before.</i>

00:24.984 --> 00:26.692
You'll be using this.

00:26.736 --> 00:29.945
<i>Skill and ingenuity will be
pushed to the limit.</i>

00:29.989 --> 00:32.114
<i>Some will rise to the challenge,</i>

00:32.158 --> 00:33.949
<i>some will fall,</i>

00:33.993 --> 00:35.451
<i>but only the best
will be crowned</i>

00:35.494 --> 00:37.286
<i>"Forged in Fire" champions</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:40.289
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:40.332 --> 00:43.292
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:45.919
<i>¶ ¶</i>

00:45.963 --> 00:49.256
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:49.300 --> 00:50.799
<i>- Name's Kyle Gahagan.</i>

00:50.843 --> 00:54.011
I spent 4 1/2 years,
1st Ranger Battalion.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.972
<i>I did two tours in Afghanistan,
two in Iraq.</i>

00:57.016 --> 00:58.891
<i>It was a good
learning experience,</i>

00:58.934 --> 01:02.144
because if you want to be
a true custom knife maker,

01:02.188 --> 01:04.563
there's gonna be a sacrifice.

01:04.607 --> 01:07.608
<i>- My name is Ron Mizell.
I'm from Brooklyn, New York.</i>

01:07.651 --> 01:09.318
To me, bladesmith is a art form.

01:09.361 --> 01:13.489
People see me as a big,
giant, 280-pound guy

01:13.532 --> 01:15.991
<i>that's a little bit
intimidating.</i>

01:16.035 --> 01:17.576
<i>- My name is Bob Brandel.</i>

01:17.620 --> 01:19.036
<i>I'm very, very fierce,</i>

01:19.080 --> 01:21.121
and I'm very, very serious
about what I do.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.706
I'm terribly competitive
by nature,

01:22.750 --> 01:24.249
horribly so, in fact.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.335
<i>- My name's Tobin Nieto.</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:29.713
With every blade I make,
there's a little bit of myself.

01:29.757 --> 01:33.342
<i>Definitely ugly and dirty
and raggedy enough to be used,</i>

01:33.385 --> 01:35.010
and they end up looking like me.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.553
<i>[chuckles]</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:37.554
- Gentlemen,

01:37.598 --> 01:39.014
welcome to the Forge.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.766
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

01:40.810 --> 01:43.185
You are here to engage
in three rounds of competition

01:43.229 --> 01:46.271
designed to test
every aspect of blade making,

01:46.315 --> 01:49.358
from design to forging
to fit and finish.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.360
At the end of each round,
you will hand your work over

01:51.403 --> 01:53.362
to our panel of expert judges:

01:53.405 --> 01:56.615
American Bladesmith Society
Master Smith J. Neilson;

01:56.659 --> 01:59.201
next, historical weapons
re-creation specialist

01:59.245 --> 02:00.869
David Baker;

02:00.913 --> 02:03.705
finally, martial artist
and edged weapon specialist

02:03.749 --> 02:05.165
Doug Marcaida.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.708
They will decide
who will be declared

02:06.752 --> 02:08.377
the "Forged in Fire" champion

02:08.420 --> 02:11.713
and leave with a check
for $10,000.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.382
Today we're gonna make things

02:13.425 --> 02:15.050
a little bit more difficult.

02:15.094 --> 02:18.053
<i>¶ ¶</i>

02:18.097 --> 02:21.431
On this table are all of the
blades that failed to progress

02:21.475 --> 02:23.892
to round two last season.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.645
Your challenge is
to choose one and reforge it

02:26.689 --> 02:28.814
into a weapon of your own design

02:28.858 --> 02:30.566
and in your signature style,

02:30.609 --> 02:33.777
making it a fully
functional weapon.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.821
These failed blades
are a testament

02:35.865 --> 02:38.740
to how difficult
this round can be.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.909
<i>- Working with blades
that have been forged before,</i>

02:40.953 --> 02:42.786
<i>you're limited.</i>

02:42.830 --> 02:45.581
<i>You don't know exactly
what's happened to them.</i>

02:45.624 --> 02:47.916
It's not like working
with a raw piece of steel.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.919
- Also, we're letting
you know now:

02:50.963 --> 02:54.089
your finished weapons will
then be tested in a log chop...

02:54.133 --> 02:56.258
<i>¶ ¶</i>

02:56.302 --> 02:58.635
And a bread slice.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.470
The blades themselves
must fall within

03:00.514 --> 03:02.139
the following size parameters:

03:02.183 --> 03:05.767
<i>the length of the blade,
not including the tang,</i>

03:05.811 --> 03:08.103
<i>must not exceed 13 inches</i>

03:08.147 --> 03:10.772
<i>and must be more than 10 inches.</i>

03:10.816 --> 03:12.274
<i>The overall length of the weapon</i>

03:12.318 --> 03:15.027
<i>must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:15.070 --> 03:17.738
Additionally,
you must also incorporate

03:17.781 --> 03:19.948
an integral finger ring.

03:19.992 --> 03:23.410
<i>An integral finger ring
is a loop that is integrated</i>

03:23.454 --> 03:25.621
<i>somewhere within
the handle of the knife</i>

03:25.664 --> 03:28.290
<i>to provide added control
and a more secure grip</i>

03:28.334 --> 03:30.334
<i>while slashing or thrusting.</i>

03:30.377 --> 03:33.003
<i>- Trying to figure out how
to incorporate a finger ring</i>

03:33.047 --> 03:36.298
from failed blades
is gonna be a challenge.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.966
- You will have ten minutes
to work on your design.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.677
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.681
Your ten-minute design
window starts... now.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.142
<i>[rock music]</i>

03:47.186 --> 03:49.561
<i>- Blade selection here
is gonna be very important</i>

03:49.605 --> 03:51.772
<i>if they're gonna add
that finger ring.</i>

03:51.815 --> 03:53.774
<i>- It's really about
that volume of the metal.</i>

03:53.817 --> 03:55.317
- Yes.

03:55.361 --> 03:57.569
What I'd be going
for is just more steel.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.404
<i>- I went
for the wakizashi blade.</i>

03:59.448 --> 04:02.324
<i>The tang being still
so thick and long enough,</i>

04:02.368 --> 04:04.701
<i>I knew I'd be able to draw
enough metal out</i>

04:04.745 --> 04:06.703
to have that wraparound
for the handle.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.748
<i>I'm making what's called
a blacksmith's knife.</i>

04:09.792 --> 04:11.792
<i>I decided to go
with the squirrel tail</i>

04:11.835 --> 04:13.585
<i>to make the ring guard.</i>

04:13.629 --> 04:15.170
<i>- I love that Bob's doing
a squirrel tail design</i>

04:15.214 --> 04:16.880
<i>to incorporate that finger ring,</i>

04:16.924 --> 04:18.840
<i>but it's not the easiest
to pull off.</i>

04:18.884 --> 04:20.550
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:20.594 --> 04:22.636
<i>- My competitors
beat me to the table,</i>

04:22.680 --> 04:25.681
<i>so I pick up the biggest hunk
of steel that's still there.</i>

04:25.724 --> 04:29.559
<i>My signature blade is
a rather large chopping knife.</i>

04:29.603 --> 04:32.813
You can use a large chopping
knife for chopping trees,

04:32.856 --> 04:35.732
clearing brush, killing zombies,
or anything like that, you know?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.859
<i>[drum flourish]</i>

04:37.903 --> 04:39.569
<i>I decided to go
with a blade shape</i>

04:39.613 --> 04:42.030
<i>that's based off
of an oversized karambit</i>

04:42.074 --> 04:44.366
<i>and a large Roman falx.</i>

04:44.410 --> 04:46.451
<i>I thought, "Chopping, slicing...</i>

04:46.495 --> 04:48.203
<i>Let's put 'em together,
see what happens."</i>

04:48.247 --> 04:49.871
<i>- What we have here
is a guy who's chosen</i>

04:49.915 --> 04:51.707
<i>a canister Damascus blade.</i>

04:51.750 --> 04:53.041
Might not even know
that's what it is,

04:53.085 --> 04:54.459
but he could get
a brilliant finish on that

04:54.503 --> 04:55.836
<i>if he does a great job.</i>

04:55.879 --> 04:57.296
- Oh, absolutely, and he's got

04:57.339 --> 04:59.715
a lot of steel on there
to work with too.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.967
<i>- In order to forge
this finger ring,</i>

05:02.011 --> 05:05.345
<i>I grabbed a blade that's got
a lot of meat on the handle,</i>

05:05.389 --> 05:08.098
but I have no idea
what the material is.

05:08.142 --> 05:11.560
<i>I am best known
for bowie knives.</i>

05:11.603 --> 05:14.730
<i>Being in the military,
when I come into a situation</i>

05:14.773 --> 05:17.566
<i>that's not planned,
I've got to adapt and overcome.</i>

05:17.609 --> 05:20.235
That's what I've got to do here.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.737
<i>- The reason
I picked this dagger:</i>

05:21.780 --> 05:23.780
<i>it's the only blade
that was left</i>

05:23.824 --> 05:26.533
<i>with a little bit more
material that I needed.</i>

05:26.577 --> 05:30.120
<i>My signature blade
is the kukri blade.</i>

05:30.164 --> 05:33.081
<i>Kukri is what
the Nepal army used,</i>

05:33.125 --> 05:35.667
<i>and there's stories where
they will drop their gun,</i>

05:35.711 --> 05:37.419
and they will grab their kukri,

05:37.463 --> 05:38.795
<i>because they don't
trust the gun,</i>

05:38.839 --> 05:40.756
<i>but they trust the kukri knife.</i>

05:40.799 --> 05:44.343
- Gentlemen, your ten-minute
design window is now closed.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.763
Your three-hour forging
window starts... now.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.431
<i>[energetic music]</i>

05:49.475 --> 05:51.933
- All right.
- Here we go.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.518
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:53.562 --> 05:55.187
<i>- My strengths
in bladesmithing are that</i>

05:55.230 --> 05:57.939
I can forge efficiently,
effectively,

05:57.983 --> 06:00.400
and pretty damn quick.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.444
- Bob, I'm curious, though...
'cause he's going with

06:02.488 --> 06:04.946
a squirrel tail design
for his handle...

06:04.990 --> 06:07.324
If that end of that
squirrel tail isn't connected

06:07.368 --> 06:09.117
to the main body of the blade,

06:09.161 --> 06:11.787
is that gonna stay together
while it's chopping?

06:11.830 --> 06:14.331
I hope he's gonna make it
a solid piece.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.957
<i>- From an aesthetic standpoint,</i>

06:16.001 --> 06:17.626
<i>there's just something
really cool to me</i>

06:17.669 --> 06:18.919
<i>about a knife that</i>

06:18.962 --> 06:20.837
<i>the handle, the tang,</i>

06:20.881 --> 06:24.883
the guard, and the blade
are all one homogenous unit.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.676
[clang]

06:26.720 --> 06:28.053
<i>[rock music]</i>

06:28.097 --> 06:29.721
- Whoo!

06:29.765 --> 06:31.306
<i>I feel bad that I have</i>

06:31.350 --> 06:33.058
<i>to take something
that somebody else made</i>

06:33.102 --> 06:34.810
<i>and basically destroy it,</i>

06:34.853 --> 06:38.313
but sometimes you got to destroy
things to create something new.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.190
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:40.234 --> 06:41.817
- Tobin's showing
some remarkable skill

06:41.860 --> 06:43.610
with that air hammer.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.987
- He's doing a very good job.
- Very good control.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.906
- He's not running back and
forth; he's taking his time.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.408
But we've seen in the past,

06:49.451 --> 06:52.119
the guys that pace themselves
usually do well.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.328
- All right, we're still going.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.579
<i>I think I'm playing</i>

06:54.623 --> 06:56.331
the reverse psychology
card here.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.376
Like, I look like a big,
cuddly, furry teddy bear.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.878
<i>No one's gonna see me coming.</i>

07:01.922 --> 07:03.797
It's all part of the plan.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.465
[furnace roaring]

07:05.509 --> 07:08.009
<i>[funky music]</i>

07:08.053 --> 07:09.553
<i>- I'm not real happy
about working</i>

07:09.596 --> 07:11.513
<i>through other people's mistakes.</i>

07:11.557 --> 07:13.682
I don't know what issues
they've run into,

07:13.725 --> 07:15.684
what I'm looking at.

07:15.727 --> 07:19.187
The blade's roughly
2, 2 1/2 inches wide.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.523
<i>So it's a nice, beefy blade.</i>

07:21.567 --> 07:23.525
<i>With the challenge given,
I decide I need</i>

07:23.569 --> 07:26.069
<i>to thin that down a little bit.</i>

07:26.113 --> 07:29.030
- Kyle is the only one
whose design

07:29.074 --> 07:33.535
looked almost exactly like
what was already there.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.870
- And that blade had
cracks in it.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.872
He needs to fix that.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.583
- That thing doesn't hit hard.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.335
<i>- I used my military experience
in bladesmithing</i>

07:42.379 --> 07:45.547
<i>to start a blade therapy
organization.</i>

07:45.591 --> 07:47.048
<i>There's no charge.</i>

07:47.092 --> 07:48.717
<i>I keep my doors open
at all times</i>

07:48.760 --> 07:50.635
<i>and let veterans come in.</i>

07:50.679 --> 07:52.804
We'll work together
and work through things.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.723
Don't got a lot of metal
to work with.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.558

07:56.602 --> 07:57.976
<i>[driving rock music]</i>

07:58.020 --> 07:59.561
<i>This is definitely frustrating,</i>

07:59.605 --> 08:01.062
<i>because the metal of that blade</i>

08:01.106 --> 08:02.772
<i>is really thin, and I don't know</i>

08:02.816 --> 08:05.150
what the previous owner
did with it.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.069
<i>I had to figure out
where to put the finger ring</i>

<i>on the knife.</i>

08:09.364 --> 08:10.906
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:10.949 --> 08:12.908
- Ron's really going to town.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.242
<i>- I don't know if he has
enough metal there</i>

08:14.286 --> 08:15.744
<i>to add a finger ring.</i>

08:15.787 --> 08:17.078
- I mean, he could
run over and say,

"You know, I picked
the wrong piece,"

08:18.832 --> 08:21.374
drop it, toss it aside,
and grab that other blade.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.293
- Yeah, we're not
too far in yet.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.016
<i>Boy, I like seeing that

12:07.060 --> 12:09.436
You went with
a forged finish on this

12:35.714 --> 12:37.422
<i>make a squirrel tail out of it.</i>

12:37.466 --> 12:40.717
My one concern, though,
you didn't physically connect

12:40.761 --> 12:42.343
<i>the tail to the body.</i>

12:42.387 --> 12:44.429
You have any ideas on that?

12:44.473 --> 12:47.849
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.142
Guess he's not gonna
share it with us, though.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.853
- I guess not.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.188

I saw you test it out

12:53.231 --> 12:54.522

12:54.566 --> 12:56.816
But I can feel that wiggle
in there.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.735
If you're not gonna share with
us what you're gonna do next,

to work with.</i>

13:08.705 --> 13:11.039
<i>It was thick but lean,</i>

13:11.082 --> 13:13.374
so spreading that out,
pulling out what you did,

13:13.418 --> 13:15.919
you did a good job.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.712
- You know, Ron,
for the biggest guy there,

13:17.756 --> 13:19.047
you sure have
the slimmest knife.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.548
[both laugh]

13:20.592 --> 13:22.217
Looking at it from afar,
I couldn't tell

13:22.260 --> 13:24.928
<i>if it was enough meat
to support the chopper.</i>

13:24.971 --> 13:28.139
There is still enough there
to make it feel good.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.809
- Kyle, go ahead and present
your weapon to the judges.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.394
<i>- You've handed us

<i>of all the knives.</i>

13:35.857 --> 13:39.484
<i>Those cracks in the back are
a really big concern, though.</i>

13:39.528 --> 13:42.111
- That's what I was trying
to relieve with the clay.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.780
- All in all,
it's a really nice shape.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.073
- Thank you.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.574
- Well, Kyle,
you actually started out

13:46.618 --> 13:48.243
with what I think was

13:48.286 --> 13:50.745
<i>the closest to finished piece
on the table,</i>

13:50.789 --> 13:53.414
so that brings up a lot
of difficulty for you,

13:53.458 --> 13:55.083
transforming it
into something else,

13:55.126 --> 13:57.293
and I think you did
a really good job with that.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.254

13:59.297 --> 14:00.672
- All right, gentlemen,

14:00.715 --> 14:02.215
it's gonna take our judges

14:15.730 --> 14:17.105

14:17.148 --> 14:18.606
<i>the design of Tobin's blade</i>

<i>because of the curve.</i>

<i>The issue over here

14:22.320 --> 14:23.528
just the way it feels.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.530
You're gonna be chopping down.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.866
That middle finger's gonna be
hitting onto that ring alone.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.326
<i>¶ ¶</i>

14:30.370 --> 14:31.786
- Dave, what do you think?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.289

it's really aggressive,

14:34.332 --> 14:36.124
that forward hook.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.167
I'm kind of worried about
the handle being so thin.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.794
It's got so much weight
in the front,

14:39.838 --> 14:41.129
nothing in the back.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.922
- Just gonna have to be
very creative

14:42.966 --> 14:44.132
about how I'm gonna fix it up,

14:44.175 --> 14:46.301
but it's gonna get done.

14:46.344 --> 14:50.763
- All right, let's
move on to Bob's blade.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.849
<i>- It's got enough weight
in that blade</i>

14:52.893 --> 14:54.475
<i>that it'll chop pretty well.</i>

14:54.519 --> 14:56.311
<i>But the way the ring's
set up right now,</i>

14:56.354 --> 14:58.980
it's gonna bang the heck
out of your hand.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.732
- Jay?

15:00.775 --> 15:02.525
- He rounded his spine off.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.986
<i>Any kind of corner
is gonna be weaker,</i>

15:05.030 --> 15:08.197
<i>as far as stress,
than a rounded radius.</i>

15:08.241 --> 15:10.074
I think that was
a very smart move.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.492
<i>¶ ¶</i>

15:11.536 --> 15:13.536

just making it through.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.331
- [chuckles]

15:16.374 --> 15:18.708
- Let's move on to Ron's blade.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.293
<i>- Very, very slim.</i>

15:20.337 --> 15:21.628
<i>How is that gonna affect</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:22.712
<i>the stability of the blade?</i>

15:22.756 --> 15:24.881
The ring, very small.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.925
- They're looking
at my knife right now.

15:26.968 --> 15:30.136
I don't know
what he's doing with it.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.388
- What do you think, Jay?
- It's very lean.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.100
You know, Ron, he had to fight
to get what he did out of this.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.020
- Is there any concern
that this would snap in a test?

15:39.064 --> 15:42.106
- Oh, absolutely.
It's a possibility.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.360
- So our last blade
is Kyle's blade.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.570
- He did start out
with the most complete blade,

15:47.614 --> 15:49.238
which I think was
more of a hindrance.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.074
There was only so much
he could do with it.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.201
I mean, he did alter it
significantly,

15:53.244 --> 15:55.328
which I'm very impressed
by that.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.414
But, again, they were working
with blades that failed.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.459
Don't take any chances.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.127
- Dave?

16:03.171 --> 16:05.213
- I think the design
is beautiful.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.549
<i>But those flaws are still there
from the original blade.</i>

16:08.593 --> 16:11.302
Those cracks were probably
really hard to see,

16:11.346 --> 16:13.388
until he started
cleaning this up.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.390
<i>It wouldn't have been
too late to go back</i>

16:15.433 --> 16:17.225
and grab another piece of steel,

16:17.268 --> 16:20.770
but you get locked in
on what you want to see happen,

16:20.814 --> 16:23.231
and you're just gonna fight
that metal until you get it.

but reforging the piece itself.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.819
You showed a great
level of skill.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.489
Just... it wasn't enough to pull
out the stops on that spine,

17:54.532 --> 17:56.824
and we just can't have that
kind of structural failure

17:56.868 --> 17:58.659

to help my fellow veterans</i>

18:13.885 --> 18:16.969

18:17.013 --> 18:21.891
I'm not gonna quit just because
I had a bump in the road here.

on making it

18:28.733 --> 18:30.900
through to the second round.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.361
Your next challenge
is to finish your blades

18:33.404 --> 18:36.531
by turning them into
fully functioning weapons.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.407
You'll do this
by crafting handles

18:38.451 --> 18:40.201
and attaching them
to your blades

18:40.245 --> 18:43.454
using the range of materials
available to you.

18:43.498 --> 18:46.415
You will have three hours
to complete this challenge.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.417
You can use that time
to address any flaws

18:48.461 --> 18:50.461
that exist in your blades now,

18:50.505 --> 18:52.839
but use that time wisely.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.716
When time is up,
your blades will be tested

18:55.760 --> 18:59.887
on their strength and
durability in a log chop...

18:59.931 --> 19:01.889
and on their ability
to hold an edge

19:01.933 --> 19:04.225
in a sharpness test.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.060
Remember, at the end
of this challenge,

19:06.104 --> 19:09.063
one of you will be asked
to surrender his weapon

19:09.107 --> 19:10.314

Your time starts... now.

19:15.530 --> 19:19.157
<i>[rock music]</i>

19:19.200 --> 19:20.825

is try and correct

19:20.869 --> 19:23.411
some of the issues
I have with the handle.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.454
<i>I'm just gonna put slabs
on the side of it.</i>

19:25.498 --> 19:27.165
Just right there.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.542
<i>Probably a synthetic material,
but I may put wood,</i>

19:29.586 --> 19:30.835
<i>depending on what fits.</i>

[humming]

19:33.298 --> 19:35.339
<i>¶ ¶</i>

19:35.383 --> 19:37.133
<i>- Since we've got
to be chopping wood,</i>

19:37.177 --> 19:39.635
<i>I'll pick a handle
with a little bit of grip.</i>

19:39.679 --> 19:42.597
The material I choose is a horn.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.432
I don't know what kind
of animal it is,

19:44.475 --> 19:46.267
<i>but it will be easy
to work with.</i>

19:46.311 --> 19:50.479

19:50.523 --> 19:52.773
<i>The other guys have a lot
of material on their knife,</i>

19:52.817 --> 19:55.526
<i>so I'm afraid of
the heavy knife that they have,</i>

19:55.570 --> 19:57.653
<i>but I'm just worried
about my own work,</i>

19:57.697 --> 20:00.198
and that's what I'm
concentrating on right now.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.950
I want to win this
for the money.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.535
It's a nice little prize money.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.245
<i>¶ ¶</i>

20:06.289 --> 20:08.289
- I know I have a lot
of grinding I need to get done

20:08.333 --> 20:10.708
<i>to make the blade
as smooth as possible.</i>

20:10.752 --> 20:12.084

20:12.128 --> 20:13.419
Let's see what happens.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.504
[metal clangs]

20:15.548 --> 20:17.465
- Blade on the floor.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.841
- That's a wee bit ballsy,
isn't it?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.301
- Just a tad.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.636
<i>I dropped that blade on purpose</i>

20:21.679 --> 20:23.387
because that's how
I test the point

20:23.431 --> 20:24.805
of all the blades I make.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.807
- Honestly, dropping
a knife on its tip,

20:26.851 --> 20:28.643
you'll find out if it's
gonna crack or not.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.186
- It's a good way
to test it, really.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.230
<i>- Across the board,
the tip is usually</i>

20:32.273 --> 20:33.689
<i>the weakest part of the knife,</i>

20:33.733 --> 20:36.692
and if it's gonna chip,
I want it to chip there

20:36.736 --> 20:40.696
<i>so if I have to regrind it,
I can do that.</i>

20:40.740 --> 20:44.325
- You have 90 minutes remaining.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.743
- Oh, the ever-present
clock.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.578
How doth it tick.

20:47.622 --> 20:51.290
<i>[rock music]</i>

20:51.334 --> 20:52.708
- He's got
the angle grinder out.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.502
I'm not sure what he's doing,
though.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.170
- I reach for my angle grinder,

20:56.214 --> 20:58.673
'cause I know that will cut
a trench into the blade.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.508
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:00.551 --> 21:03.761
<i>And I'll put the pin in
with no problem.</i>

21:03.805 --> 21:06.681
<i>And the blade is thin,
but I realize</i>

21:06.724 --> 21:10.017
this blade is tougher
than I thought it was.

21:10.061 --> 21:15.523
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:15.566 --> 21:17.024
- [sighs]

21:17.068 --> 21:19.402
I noticed what I thought
was a deep grind mark.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.695
Oh, [bleep].

21:20.738 --> 21:22.113
<i>But I got to looking at it,</i>

21:22.156 --> 21:23.906
and it turned out
to actually be a crack.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.033
And then I noticed
a couple more.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.868
[moans]

to soften up that spot

21:31.457 --> 21:32.957
where he sees that crack,

21:33.001 --> 21:34.709
'cause if it's hard steel,

21:34.752 --> 21:37.753
it is more likely
to fracture during a chop.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.797
<i>- Where the cracks are

21:39.841 --> 21:41.382
<i>too much of a problem.</i>

21:41.426 --> 21:43.467
I'm just gonna keep

21:52.312 --> 21:53.602
- Sometimes the smaller
doesn't work;

21:53.646 --> 21:55.229
you got to go bigger.

22:48.451 --> 22:52.328
You have five minutes remaining.

22:52.372 --> 22:56.624
<i>- Plan B was
just to do a handle wrap.</i>

22:56.667 --> 22:59.627
The blade basically said,

Forget the wood crap."

- Fellow bladesmiths,
we're here at the log chop.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.838
This is gonna put
your blades to the test,

23:43.881 --> 23:46.841
checking the durability
and their edge retention.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.718
I'm gonna take each
of your blades, do ten chops,

23:49.762 --> 23:52.555

to see how well it held up.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.558

27:23.142 --> 27:25.225
Tobin, how do you feel?

27:25.269 --> 27:27.561
- Eh, a little nauseous
right now, but I'm ready.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.563
[laughter]

27:29.607 --> 27:31.565
- In the first two rounds,
you came here,

27:31.609 --> 27:33.734
and you made a weapon
of your own design.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.402
In the final challenge,

27:35.446 --> 27:38.405
you'll be forging an iconic
weapon from history.

27:38.449 --> 27:39.948
- [chuckles]

27:39.992 --> 27:42.743
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

27:42.787 --> 27:44.244
A cutlass.

27:44.288 --> 27:46.622
- Ooh. [groans]
- [laughing]

27:46.666 --> 27:49.166
Arr, me hearties,
we get to make a cutlass!

27:49.210 --> 27:51.460
I'm very excited about that.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.962
<i>- The cutlass is a short,
broad-bladed saber</i>

27:54.006 --> 27:56.924
<i>developed in Europe
during the 16th century.</i>

27:56.967 --> 27:58.884
<i>Although it was made
as a land weapon,</i>

27:58.928 --> 28:01.929
<i>it was quickly adopted as
the sailor's weapon of choice,</i>

28:01.972 --> 28:04.598
<i>largely because it was strong
enough to hack through ropes,</i>

28:04.642 --> 28:06.433
<i>canvas, and wood,</i>

28:06.477 --> 28:08.352
<i>but also because
it was short enough to use</i>

28:08.396 --> 28:10.312
<i>in close-quarters combat.</i>

28:10.356 --> 28:13.273
<i>This made it popular amongst
navies throughout the world.</i>

28:13.317 --> 28:15.484
<i>The last use of the cutlass
in a boarding action</i>

28:15.528 --> 28:19.905
<i>by the British Royal Navy
was recorded as late as 1941.</i>

28:19.949 --> 28:22.449
<i>Its effectiveness in battle
also made the cutlass favored</i>

28:22.493 --> 28:25.119
<i>amongst pirates, as portrayed
in the film franchise</i>

28:25.162 --> 28:26.954
<i>"The Pirates of the Caribbean."</i>

28:26.997 --> 28:28.122
<i>¶ ¶</i>

28:28.165 --> 28:29.581
The length of the blade

28:29.625 --> 28:32.543
must be between
24 and 28 inches,

28:32.586 --> 28:34.795
no more, no less.

28:34.839 --> 28:38.173
And the blade also
must be curved.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.300
- Tobin, he looked like
he was like,

28:40.344 --> 28:42.469
"Oh, this is my weapon
of choice."

28:42.513 --> 28:45.305
- Oh, yeah.
- [groans]

28:45.349 --> 28:47.975
I'm a little worried about it.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.602
- You will have five days
at your home forge

28:50.646 --> 28:52.146
to complete this challenge.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.440
After those five days,
you will return

28:54.483 --> 28:57.109
and turn your cutlass over
to our judges.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.361
They will put your weapons
through a series

28:59.405 --> 29:01.989
of vigorous and dynamic tests.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.867
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

29:04.910 --> 29:06.452
When the tests are complete,

29:08.122 --> 29:10.164
which of you is the
"Forged in Fire" champion

29:10.207 --> 29:12.416

Good luck, gentlemen.

<i>[rock music]</i>

29:21.719 --> 29:22.885
<i>- I've made lots of blades</i>

29:22.928 --> 29:25.512
but never a cutlass.

29:25.556 --> 29:29.016
<i>The design plan for my weapon

29:29.059 --> 29:32.352
clean, flowing, balanced,

<i>Taking on this final challenge,</i>

29:39.779 --> 29:42.362
it's gonna be
a little different here.

29:42.406 --> 29:45.532
My home shop
is a little bit rustic.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.409
I'm just gonna go at it.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.578
<i>The first step is getting
the whole material</i>

30:09.642 --> 30:13.644
<i>The drive belt is slipping off
every time I turn it on.</i>

30:13.687 --> 30:15.312
If I have to bit this metal
by hand,

30:15.356 --> 30:17.648
it's gonna take me
twice the time.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.024
You can do this, baby.
Come on.

30:19.068 --> 30:20.025
Get me there.

30:30.204 --> 30:32.079
I'm looking forward

<i>What I'm looking at doing
is a blacksmith-style hilt</i>

30:35.793 --> 30:40.921

<i>And I accidentally knock some</i>

30:58.482 --> 31:00.774
of the kiln shelving off
that acts as the door,

31:00.818 --> 31:03.443
<i>so I have to let it
cool down before I try</i>

31:03.487 --> 31:05.654
any major repairs on it.

31:05.698 --> 31:09.116
I have to very gingerly
and carefully

31:09.159 --> 31:11.827
try and set it
back where it belongs,

31:11.871 --> 31:15.289
'cause right now
when it's really hot,

31:15.332 --> 31:16.290
it's fragile.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.795
Ah.

<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:23.507 --> 31:24.798
-<i> Yesterday I had some problem</i>

31:24.842 --> 31:26.800
<i>with the power hammer at first,</i>

31:26.844 --> 31:31.471
<i>but I was able to get the metal
down to the proper thickness.</i>

31:31.515 --> 31:34.933
Now I'm just gonna concentrate
on finishing the handle.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.687
<i>[rock music]</i>

31:38.731 --> 31:40.981
<i>I want then
to split it into two,</i>

31:41.025 --> 31:43.692
<i>almost like a snake tongue.</i>

31:43.736 --> 31:46.361
I want the line
to be a smooth line.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.824
I always like to make my knife
more organic feeling to it.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.576
Come on.

31:52.620 --> 31:53.660
It's getting cold.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.495
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:55.539 --> 31:57.456
<i>The metal's so thin right now,</i>

31:57.499 --> 32:01.126
I can't bend it back fast enough
before it cools down.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.462
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer.

32:03.505 --> 32:05.923
If I don't keep it hot enough,
it will crack on me.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.009
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:09.053 --> 32:10.510
<i>- After the forge broke,</i>

32:10.554 --> 32:12.679
<i>I was able to find
some fire bricks,</i>

32:12.723 --> 32:14.723
<i>patch it back together.</i>

32:14.767 --> 32:16.683
I feel invigorated again.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.894
<i>I got my blade ground down.</i>

32:18.938 --> 32:21.521
<i>I got the weight
at a point where I like it.</i>

32:21.565 --> 32:23.857
So I'm gonna be forging
a hand guard

32:23.901 --> 32:26.193
for this particular cutlass.

32:26.236 --> 32:30.364
<i>What I'm doing is a repaired
blacksmith-type handle</i>

32:30.407 --> 32:33.533
<i>that would have been done
in the New World</i>

32:33.577 --> 32:35.202
during Spanish colonialism.

<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:41.249
<i>Nighttime, day four.</i>

32:41.293 --> 32:42.876
<i>I'm working with the handle.</i>

32:42.920 --> 32:45.545
<i>I'm looking at it,
and then I just think,</i>

32:45.589 --> 32:47.714
<i>"Screw it; I got to make
something a little bit bigger,</i>

32:47.758 --> 32:49.549
<i>something more comfortable
with the hand."</i>

32:49.593 --> 32:51.760
I'm a little pressured,
but I can't panic.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.887
<i>[rock music]</i>

32:53.931 --> 32:55.722
<i>- I got to start
my heat treating process.</i>

<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:58.811 --> 32:59.726
Okay, here we go.

<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:03.899 --> 33:07.234
<i>Moment of truth, I'm about
to pull this blade out this oil</i>

33:07.277 --> 33:10.320
and see what we have.

33:10.364 --> 33:12.406
Eh.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.740
I think we good.

33:13.784 --> 33:15.117
<i>[rock music]</i>

33:15.160 --> 33:16.910
<i>Once I start grinding the blade,</i>

<i>it's looking good;
it's coming out.</i>

33:18.664 --> 33:20.789
<i>I think it'll pass
any kind of trashing</i>

33:20.833 --> 33:22.249
<i>they want to put it to.</i>

33:22.292 --> 33:24.918
I made a $10,000 zombie killer.

33:24.962 --> 33:27.754
It feels really good.

33:27.798 --> 33:31.967
I mean, like, it will chop
anything in half.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.260
<i>[percussive music]</i>

33:33.303 --> 33:35.095

<i>out of some larger material.</i>

33:37.057 --> 33:39.224
Looks very tough and raw.

33:39.268 --> 33:41.768
And today, day five,
is all the finish work

33:41.812 --> 33:43.937
that still needs to be done

33:43.981 --> 33:45.856
<i>and do a little bit of testing.</i>

comes into play.</i>

34:06.962 --> 34:09.713
<i>My number one priority
going into this challenge</i>

34:09.757 --> 34:12.007
<i>was to make the blade
battle-ready.</i>

34:12.051 --> 34:13.884
<i>I know it's not
aesthetically pretty,</i>

34:13.927 --> 34:17.637
but it is gonna be
a queen of destruction.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.639
Aw, yeah.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.666
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:46.710 --> 34:48.502
- Tobin, Ron, welcome back,

34:48.545 --> 34:51.004
and welcome to the marina.

34:51.048 --> 34:53.090
Because both of your weapons
are cutlasses,

34:53.133 --> 34:55.342
instruments commonly
used by sailors,

34:55.385 --> 34:59.346
we thought it was only fitting
to test them on this ship.

34:59.389 --> 35:03.016
I hope that your five days at
your home forge was productive.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.102
Tobin, how did it go?

35:05.145 --> 35:06.520
- Ah, overall,
it went pretty well.

35:06.563 --> 35:10.190
<i>I decided to think espada ancha,</i>

35:10.234 --> 35:12.651
<i>which were Spanish swords
commonly used</i>

35:12.694 --> 35:17.197
<i>by certain pirates with
a blacksmith-style handle.</i>

35:17.241 --> 35:19.366
I call it
The Queen of the Damned.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.784
- Nice.

35:20.828 --> 35:23.036
Ron, how did your time go?

35:23.080 --> 35:24.746
- Tried to go fancy
with the handle.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.290
<i>Tried to make a snake tongue
over the blade.</i>

35:27.334 --> 35:30.210
<i>That was a little challenge,
but overall,</i>

35:30.254 --> 35:31.878
<i>pretty well, I believe.</i>

35:31.922 --> 35:34.172
- Your weapons look fantastic,

35:34.216 --> 35:37.592
but as you know, aesthetic
is secondary to performance

35:37.636 --> 35:39.386
under extreme pressure.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.221
We are now gonna put
both of your weapons

35:41.265 --> 35:43.557
through three different tests.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.600
Up first is the strength test.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.644
Dave?

35:48.647 --> 35:50.814
- Gentlemen, the cutlass
was a weapon

35:50.858 --> 35:53.900
that was specifically designed
for naval combat

35:53.944 --> 35:56.153
but was just
as effective on land.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.280
Now, any pirate
that went raiding

35:58.323 --> 36:00.574
would probably run into
a situation where he needed

36:00.617 --> 36:02.576
to work his way
through a barricade.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.411
So to test the strength
of your weapons,

36:04.454 --> 36:08.248
we're gonna break our way
through these crates.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.625
Tobin, you're up.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.751
- Let's do this!

36:11.795 --> 36:14.963
When I saw the crates,

36:15.007 --> 36:16.923
<i>the only thing
I could think of was,</i>

36:16.967 --> 36:18.633
"Those poor crates."

36:28.228 --> 36:29.228
Whoo-hoo!

36:33.317 --> 36:36.234
- Well, Tobin, it's got
a lot of weight to it.

36:36.278 --> 36:37.903
It's quite a heavy beast.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.946
I like the blacksmith
guard, nice.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.449
But it's so long that your hand

36:42.492 --> 36:45.452
has a lot of room
to travel in here.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.622
A bit of deformation and
a couple of chips in the blade.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.040
- Okay.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.875
- But, Tobin,
this will definitely

36:51.919 --> 36:53.627
break through a barricade.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.296
Good job.
- Thanks.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.256
- Ron, you're up next.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.633
- Let's do it.

36:59.676 --> 37:00.675
Going to the weapons test,

37:00.719 --> 37:02.510
<i>it's nerve-racking,</i>

37:02.554 --> 37:04.137
<i>but I'm hoping
everything works out.</i>

37:04.181 --> 37:06.973
It should have the weight on it
to do the chopping.

<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

37:09.186 --> 37:12.145

37:12.189 --> 37:20.189
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:23.700 --> 37:27.077
- So, Ron, though
your handle is very crude,

37:27.120 --> 37:29.246
it was actually
pretty comfortable,

37:29.289 --> 37:32.874
and your blade shows
no chipping, no damage.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.501
It's a little on the heavy side,

37:34.544 --> 37:37.170
but it didn't feel like
it was pulling me forward.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.839
I was able to control the tip.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.384
But all in all,

37:42.427 --> 37:46.179
it went through some crates.

37:46.223 --> 37:48.181
- To test the sharpness
of your weapon,

37:48.225 --> 37:52.018
I will take your weapon and cut
through fish and then rope.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.770
Tobin, you're up.
- [chuckles]

37:53.814 --> 37:56.690
Let's do it.
I'm ready.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.871
It lacerated through the rope,

38:11.915 --> 38:13.540
but it didn't cut
all the way through.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.208

38:15.252 --> 38:18.003
- I hear the chunk
of the blade go "whoosh,"

38:18.046 --> 38:19.379
right through the fish,
and then I hear it

38:19.423 --> 38:22.048
<i>hit the ground, plop.</i>

38:22.092 --> 38:25.218
Why did it not cut the rope?

38:25.262 --> 38:27.220
I... it's...

38:27.264 --> 38:30.390
Little bit of disbelief
about that.

38:30.434 --> 38:32.100
- Ron, you're up next.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.560

38:44.656 --> 38:47.449

lacerated the fish,

38:47.492 --> 38:50.243
but it didn't slice
all the way through.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.703
Your edge really
isn't that sharp

38:51.747 --> 38:54.331
to cut all the way through.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.624
- Ron's blade doesn't
go through the fish,

38:56.668 --> 39:00.628
but it cuts the rope.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.422
Huh.

39:02.466 --> 39:04.466
- Bladesmiths,
this is the kill test.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.302
I will take your cutlass
and deliver offensive strikes

39:07.346 --> 39:09.179
to this ballistic dummy.

39:09.222 --> 39:13.641
Then we can see how much damage
your cutlass will deliver.

Tobin, you're up.

40:42.732 --> 40:46.192
- Tobin, Ron, you were both
given five days

40:46.236 --> 40:49.863
at your home forge to create
signature cutlasses

40:49.906 --> 40:53.867
to perform in our final round
of testing.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.243
Doug.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.036
- Ron, the balance of your blade

40:57.080 --> 41:00.039
<i>allowed me to move around
in a fluid motion.</i>

41:00.083 --> 41:02.792
<i>It's got good balance
for recovery as well.</i>

41:02.836 --> 41:05.712
But a cutlass is
a thrust and slash weapon.

41:05.755 --> 41:08.298
In one test, it just
didn't perform that way.

41:08.341 --> 41:09.757
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:09.801 --> 41:13.052
- Tobin, I love the edge
geometry of your blade.

41:13.096 --> 41:15.722
<i>It's got good flats
and a good, thin taper</i>

41:15.765 --> 41:17.432
<i>that allowed it to cut well,</i>

41:17.476 --> 41:19.196
<i>but I would've liked
to have seen that blade</i>

41:19.227 --> 41:21.561
in height reduced by about 1/3.

41:21.605 --> 41:23.104
I think you would've got
a better heat treat,

41:23.148 --> 41:24.522
and it would've prevented
the chipping

41:24.566 --> 41:27.233
on the edge of your blade.

41:27.277 --> 41:30.570
- Bladesmiths, you've both done
commendable work,

41:30.614 --> 41:33.072
but it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge

41:33.116 --> 41:34.574
and one of you to be declared

41:34.618 --> 41:36.409

41:48.798 --> 41:51.633
- Ron, your blade
did not make the cut.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.510
- Ron, we pushed
your blade hard.

41:53.553 --> 41:55.553
It held its edge
through the strength test,

41:55.597 --> 42:00.350
but in the end, a cutlass has
to be a cut and thrust sword,

42:00.393 --> 42:03.645
and in the kill test,
it just didn't perform.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.104
