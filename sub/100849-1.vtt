12:13.220 --> 12:15.100
I say being a vampire rocks!

12:15.100 --> 12:16.616
I adore sucking all this blood.

12:20.338 --> 12:23.415
(woman shrieking)
(teeth chomping)

12:23.415 --> 12:24.748
- [Todd] Connie.

12:28.005 --> 12:29.843
- Look, you could bite them anywhere.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.170
- [Todd] Connie.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.753
- You're whining now?

12:33.753 --> 12:34.586
I hear you whining.

12:34.586 --> 12:35.480
Do you hear your whining?

12:35.480 --> 12:36.313
I do.

12:37.310 --> 12:38.930
- [Todd] Gonna make yourself sick.

12:38.930 --> 12:39.763
- Like you know.

12:39.763 --> 12:41.920
You've been a vampire for
what, like 2 1/2 hours?

12:43.510 --> 12:45.599
- [Todd] She's gonna make
herself sick, tell her.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.443
- Connilla, too much is too much.

12:49.625 --> 12:50.670
- Ya see?

12:50.670 --> 12:52.541
Listen to him, honey.

12:52.541 --> 12:53.740
(Connie chuckling maniacally)

12:53.740 --> 12:55.340
Never seen her like this before.

12:58.370 --> 12:59.883
- Such a pretty girl.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.280
- Kinda lied to you before.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.028
We haven't been doin' so good, you know?

13:05.028 --> 13:08.778
- Todd, it takes a lot to
nurture a healthy relationship.

13:08.778 --> 13:09.973
- Right?

13:09.973 --> 13:11.613

Hey Todd listen, just
because you're a vampire

15:18.640 --> 15:20.690
Off to Candy Land.

15:20.690 --> 15:21.980

15:21.980 --> 15:22.813

No more patient face.

15:26.530 --> 15:29.433
This is my only eyeshadow.

15:31.820 --> 15:34.303
It was a gift from my brother Denny.

18:54.937 --> 18:58.760
you know we can't fuck up
that vampire by ourselves.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.373

19:03.120 --> 19:05.993

19:23.130 --> 19:25.230
7:30, you were going to be here.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.330
7:30, we were ready.

19:27.330 --> 19:28.890
7:30, tea and hash.

19:28.890 --> 19:31.240
Stale biscuits laced
with opiated methylene.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.263
It's from China,

19:33.850 --> 19:35.700
parts of China no one ever saw before

19:35.700 --> 19:38.060
except for her, except for Clare.

19:38.060 --> 19:41.510
Where, where, where?

19:41.510 --> 19:43.100
Where were you at 7:30?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.370
Now it's late and we're at work

19:44.370 --> 19:46.300
with these two puppets posing pretty

19:46.300 --> 19:47.660

19:47.660 --> 19:49.460

19:49.460 --> 19:50.540
Don't be loud or long.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.320
Wait 'til Clare is done creating.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.153
She's creating

19:56.800 --> 19:58.980
for a calendar for "Who Knows Who."

19:58.980 --> 20:01.040
You said you'd show at 7:30,

20:01.040 --> 20:02.470
now you get no tea and biscuits.

20:02.470 --> 20:03.303
Watch the shooting.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.459
Tea and biscuits, 7:30.

20:05.459 --> 20:07.430
Pal, you missed it by eight hours.

20:07.430 --> 20:09.050
Your sense of time is problematic.

20:09.050 --> 20:11.070
7:30's almost here again.

20:11.070 --> 20:12.433
7:30,

(camera clicking)

20:25.900 --> 20:26.733
- Alice.
- What?

20:26.733 --> 20:28.170
- She's got a thing for punctuality

20:28.170 --> 20:30.060
like a damn cuckoo clock,

20:30.060 --> 20:32.380
Swiss or something in a past life.

20:32.380 --> 20:35.570
Burt, it's real good to see you.

20:35.570 --> 20:37.300
Who's the cracker?

20:37.300 --> 20:38.970
- This is Todd.
- Todd?

20:38.970 --> 20:40.100
Don't bring me no Todd.

20:40.100 --> 20:40.933
I don't like it.

20:40.933 --> 20:42.810
Call yourself somethin' else.

20:42.810 --> 20:44.020
- Do it.

20:44.020 --> 20:44.853
- I'm Paul?

20:44.853 --> 20:45.990
- What the fuck?

20:45.990 --> 20:47.303
Call yourself Nimbali.

20:48.140 --> 20:49.142
- What?

20:49.142 --> 20:50.770
- (chuckles) Shit, Rocket.

20:50.770 --> 20:52.130
You are Rocket.

20:52.130 --> 20:52.963
- Rocket!

20:52.963 --> 20:53.830
- Call yourself Rocket.

20:53.830 --> 20:54.663
Lemme hear you.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.970
- I'm Rocket.
- Your name is Rocket.

20:57.970 --> 20:58.803
Rocket.
- Rocket!

20:58.803 --> 20:59.653
- Rocket.
- Rocket.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.600
- Rocket to the moon.
- Rocket!

21:02.600 --> 21:04.150
- Rocket that he just might drop it.

21:04.150 --> 21:06.560
Rocket, yes. (laughs)

21:06.560 --> 21:08.603
You're a good cracker boy, aren't you?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.140
- Rocket, Clare's the Candyman.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.680
- Yes, I am.
- We don't bite Clare.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.700
- [Clare] No, we don't bite Clare.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.970
- She's got to be free.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.780
- Or Clare will cut off your balls.

21:17.780 --> 21:19.200
- [Burt] Yes, she has to be free.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.140
- [Clare] Yes I do, Burt baby.

21:20.140 --> 21:20.973
You know me.

21:20.973 --> 21:21.806
You do know me.

21:21.806 --> 21:24.163
- Free to travel the world.
- Free! (chuckles)

21:24.163 --> 21:25.600
- Free to score us the very most.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.730
- [Clare] Now you're
makin' a speech. (laughs)

21:26.730 --> 21:30.660
- The mostest in pharmaceuticals
that you have ever--

21:30.660 --> 21:31.903
- Ever, (chuckles) ever.

21:33.313 --> 21:34.470
- Ever partook.

21:34.470 --> 21:37.730
- Burt, you're all sexy when
you look at me like that.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.563
Yes, you are.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.670
- Lookie, lookie, mama.

21:40.670 --> 21:43.093
- [Clare] Now shut up
and you listen to me.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.380
You killed someone tonight.

21:45.380 --> 21:46.770
What the fuck?

21:46.770 --> 21:48.530
- Oh, her.
- Connie.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.210
- She was out of control.

21:50.210 --> 21:52.850
Clare, she's the kind that
makes you hate vampires.

21:52.850 --> 21:55.740
Absolutely zero discretion.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.263
Still a bit of a sore subject.

21:58.847 --> 22:00.930
Pull it together, Rocket.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.230
Isn't this cozy.

22:08.230 --> 22:09.970
- It's the bisexuality thing.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.300
- What is a Connie?

22:11.300 --> 22:14.220
What decent artistic person
would name their child Connie?

22:14.220 --> 22:16.120
It hurts me when I say it.

22:16.120 --> 22:16.953
Are the girls ready?

22:16.953 --> 22:17.870
- They've been ready.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.610
- [Clare] Okay, Alice.

22:19.610 --> 22:21.880
- Well, Connie's--
- Stop it, you're hurting me.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.350
I'm talkin' about you killing
that club's funny man,

22:24.350 --> 22:26.030
that silly Sid.

22:26.030 --> 22:26.863
- No, I didn't kill him.

22:26.863 --> 22:28.700
I just bit the shit out of him.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.336
That was outta sight.
(Clare laughing)

22:30.336 --> 22:31.267
Then I stabbed my ass off.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.650
- And the crowd went nuts.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.880
- Did they go nuts, Rocket?

22:34.880 --> 22:35.926
- He was amazing.

22:35.926 --> 22:38.320
- (chuckles) Of course
they went nuts, baby.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.680
You're a glorious vampire.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.680
But I'm told that Sid's heart stopped

35:41.859 --> 35:45.350
(tires screeching)
(jeep engine roaring)

35:45.350 --> 35:50.350
(intriguing tribal music)
(dog barking)

35:54.533 --> 35:56.030
- What is this, cigarettes?

35:56.030 --> 35:59.135
Shit, I hate when people smoke.

35:59.135 --> 36:00.083
(door banging)

36:00.083 --> 36:01.829
- Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

36:01.829 --> 36:03.473
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

36:03.473 --> 36:04.723
- Fucking rush.

36:05.763 --> 36:07.270
- Shit yeah, yes.

36:07.270 --> 36:08.879
(gasps) Oh yes!

36:08.879 --> 36:10.100
Shit, yeah.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.070
That is what I mean.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.743
Take a gun and fuck shit up!

36:16.125 --> 36:18.292
I have found my salvation.

36:20.009 --> 36:21.640
- It's for you, Sid.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.965
Tonight we're gonna fuck
up Candy Land just for you.

36:24.965 --> 36:25.798
- But how?

36:28.929 --> 36:30.548
- The Vampire Hunter.

36:30.548 --> 36:32.084
(soft intriguing music)

36:32.084 --> 36:33.842
- [Vampire Hunter] So
you want me to kill Burt.

36:33.842 --> 36:35.000
(whip tapping)

36:35.000 --> 36:35.833
- [Coco] Yes.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.170
- You're one of my best customers.

36:40.170 --> 36:43.460
- That's sick and sort of
cannibal if you think about it.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.475
- I don't think about it.

36:44.475 --> 36:47.480
(whip slapping)
(woman shrieking)

36:47.480 --> 36:48.750
- Is she a vampire?

36:48.750 --> 36:49.980
- No.

36:49.980 --> 36:53.350
I will require $5,000 to kill Burt.

36:54.742 --> 36:57.420
- Sure you want $5,000 to kill Burt?

36:57.420 --> 37:00.337
(woman whispering)

37:01.544 --> 37:02.461
No, no, ow!

37:03.694 --> 37:05.890
- Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.128
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

37:08.128 --> 37:11.628
(Vampire Hunter grunting)

37:19.900 --> 37:22.903
- We will require $10,000 to kill Burt.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.870
- That's kind of a big
jump if you, I mean.

37:27.720 --> 37:28.670
- It can go higher.

37:29.930 --> 37:32.088
- Well I was thinking
more like seven, five.

37:32.088 --> 37:33.548
- [Dori] Shut up, Babs.

37:33.548 --> 37:35.860
- That doesn't mean (speaks faintly).

37:35.860 --> 37:38.473
See we're in the middle of something.

37:43.404 --> 37:44.663
- It's gonna cost $10,000

37:46.795 --> 37:47.633
to kill Burt.

37:50.976 --> 37:52.523
- You'll have it tomorrow night.

37:53.640 --> 37:54.473
C'mon.

37:59.708 --> 38:02.541
(woman shrieking)

38:04.814 --> 38:06.447
- What the hey?

38:06.447 --> 38:09.470
You just gonna pull
$10,000 outta your cooter?

38:09.470 --> 38:11.220
- I wish my brother Denny was here.

38:12.820 --> 38:15.400
- Get out your phones, you bitches.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.070
We're strippers.

38:17.070 --> 38:17.903
Let's strip.

(dark foreboding music)

41:03.374 --> 41:06.041
(phone ringing)

41:08.769 --> 41:09.680
This is Dwayne.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.436
Now I'm a fuckin' vampire and I'm pissed.

41:12.436 --> 41:13.473
- [Dori] Dwayne, just wait.

41:14.554 --> 41:15.447
Call me back now.

41:36.280 --> 41:37.733
- Dwayne, dear.

41:39.290 --> 41:43.040
Since you are new to
the world of the undead,

41:43.040 --> 41:47.143
let me enlighten you to a
few of the facts of life.

41:48.610 --> 41:53.020
First, I am what they
refer to in the business

41:53.020 --> 41:56.160
as the head vampire.

41:56.160 --> 41:59.443
This means that you are my bitch vampire.

42:00.709 --> 42:02.554
- In your own mind, asshole.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.513
- (imitates cat meowing) Frat boy.

42:06.520 --> 42:09.653
Secondly, ladies you
should listen to this.

42:10.720 --> 42:13.570
If anything should happen
to the head vampire,

42:13.570 --> 42:16.330
all of his bitches go
up in a terrible cloud

42:16.330 --> 42:19.960
of black vat smoke, never fucking more.

42:19.960 --> 42:20.793
- That's not true.

42:20.793 --> 42:22.310
- It is true.

42:22.310 --> 42:23.413
Who's my bitch?

42:26.183 --> 42:27.016
Huh?

42:39.103 --> 42:40.395
- I'm your bitch.

42:40.395 --> 42:43.461
- (claps) Yay.

42:43.461 --> 42:46.100
Now, take off your shirt.

42:46.100 --> 42:47.313
Mine's all icky.

42:56.660 --> 42:59.950
Wow, you workout.

42:59.950 --> 43:00.783
- Yeah.

43:02.300 --> 43:04.513
- [Burt] Did you play sports growin' up?

43:06.520 --> 43:07.353
- Hockey.

43:09.300 --> 43:12.043
- I played football, little linebacker.

43:15.070 --> 43:16.520
Now Dwayne, I was wondering

43:16.520 --> 43:19.283
how did this skank squad
know that I'm here?

43:20.786 --> 43:22.050
- You come here a lot.

43:22.050 --> 43:22.883
- Mm-hmm.

43:23.780 --> 43:26.180
- Todd told Connie,
Connie's got a big mouth.

43:26.180 --> 43:28.873
- Mm-mmm, I'll wait for it.

43:33.933 --> 43:35.560
- I texted Dori.

43:35.560 --> 43:36.870
- Yes.

43:36.870 --> 43:40.343
Now, you see how that could
be hard on both of us?

43:53.140 --> 43:54.410
- I'm goin' for more bullets.

43:54.410 --> 43:55.810
I want to finish this shoot tonight.

43:55.810 --> 43:58.372
Burt, behave yourself!

43:58.372 --> 44:01.863
(soft intriguing music)

44:01.863 --> 44:04.800
(door squeaking)
(crickets chirping)

44:04.800 --> 44:06.440
Sleep it off under a bridge, man.

44:06.440 --> 44:07.950
Get the winter moving.

44:07.950 --> 44:10.020
- Get the bullets and come right back.

44:10.020 --> 44:11.313
Don't go to the bar.

44:14.087 --> 44:17.420
(gun magazine clicking)

44:30.150 --> 44:31.830
You moved everything.

44:31.830 --> 44:32.663
- [Burt] Yup.

44:33.960 --> 44:36.000
- I think that it's best that
you and Rocket leave now.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.380
Where did he go?

44:37.380 --> 44:38.810
- I don't want to leave.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.793
I want to do more drugs.

44:44.070 --> 44:44.950
- Here are your drugs.

44:44.950 --> 44:45.783
Take 'em with you.

44:45.783 --> 44:49.353
- I don't want to do my drugs,
I want to do your drugs.

44:51.261 --> 44:53.743
Now, I can't bite you.

44:53.743 --> 44:54.820
That would depress me,

44:54.820 --> 44:57.060
but I will shoot you in the face

44:57.060 --> 45:00.280
if you don't give me a
grand tour of the drug room.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.030
- You and I both know there
are no bullets in that gun.

45:07.217 --> 45:08.304
(gun blasting)

45:08.304 --> 45:10.167
- (chuckles) One left.

45:10.167 --> 45:11.198
(gun blasting)

45:11.198 --> 45:14.840
Two left! (chuckles)

45:14.840 --> 45:15.673
Boom!

45:22.460 --> 45:25.453
- [June] I'm an artist,
workin' my way through college.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.910
- [Todd] My mother's an artist.

45:27.910 --> 45:29.223
- Yeah?

45:29.223 --> 45:31.800
- (chuckles) Yeah.

45:31.800 --> 45:32.963
I love artists.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.273
- Now you.

45:39.589 --> 45:41.187
- Well as you know, I'm a vampire.

45:41.187 --> 45:44.230
Burt turned me against my
will, so now I'm bisexual.

45:44.230 --> 45:45.063
- Wait, what?

45:46.060 --> 45:48.660
- Yeah, it's really difficult.

45:48.660 --> 45:49.830
I'm not used to it.

45:49.830 --> 45:50.980
- No, you're a vampire?

45:52.380 --> 45:53.620
God, please don't bite me.

45:53.620 --> 45:55.170
- No, I know what it feels like

45:55.170 --> 45:56.050
to be turned against your will.

45:56.050 --> 45:59.348
I would never do that to you or anyone.

says that she's a photographer

and I'm stuffed in the
back of a Hummer, eww.

fuzzy until I come to

(Todd grunting)
(knife stabbing)

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:03.736

01:01:03.736 --> 01:01:04.613
- Oh hey, Todd.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.700
- It's good to see you.

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.859
Thought this guy killed you.

01:01:08.859 --> 01:01:10.180
- He did.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.350
Fucker.

01:01:16.733 --> 01:01:17.566

01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:18.399
Is he around?

01:01:18.399 --> 01:01:19.724

(shovel clanking)
(Todd thudding)

01:01:21.389 --> 01:01:22.222
- Hello, Connie.

01:01:22.222 --> 01:01:23.350
If you go right through there,

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.110
you might be able to get a chomp on him.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.463
- Stop pushing me, stop pushing.

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:29.170
- June, quickly.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.660

01:01:38.224 --> 01:01:40.326

01:01:40.326 --> 01:01:42.044
(weeps) It was a nightmare.

01:01:42.044 --> 01:01:42.877

01:01:42.877 --> 01:01:44.290
You're all right.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:45.123
- We are overrun.

01:01:45.123 --> 01:01:47.290
There are so many vampires here right now.

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.500
What, with Burt and Todd and Dwayne.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.333

01:01:53.486 --> 01:01:54.437
- Oh, there's more outside.

01:01:54.437 --> 01:01:56.153
- Oh?
- Those guys are zombies.

01:01:56.153 --> 01:01:57.180
- Hot.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.330
- And the Vampire Hunter's
wife is in there someplace.

01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:00.163
- It's out of control.

01:02:00.163 --> 01:02:01.158
- Is the Vampire Hunter here?

01:02:01.158 --> 01:02:02.908
- Yes, but he's dead.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.387

01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:06.820

- Oh.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.740

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.020
He's shooting up the studio.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.820
- But there wasn't any more bullets.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.600
Son of a bitch, gotta get that gun.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.600
- Oh I'll get that gun.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.744
- Babs.
- Are you crazy?

01:02:18.744 --> 01:02:20.958
- You can't send a girl
in to do a woman's work.

01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:22.430
- [Coco] No, Babs.

01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:23.263
