A house full of
romantically challenged

00:07.173 --> 00:08.842
{\an8}reality TV stars

00:08.908 --> 00:11.344
{\an8}are trying to find
love in Malibu.

00:11.411 --> 00:12.679
{\an8}That's pretty tough to do

00:12.746 --> 00:15.849
{\an8}when your ex is lurking
around the corner.

00:15.915 --> 00:18.351
{\an8}Three exes have already
joined the house

00:18.418 --> 00:19.919
{\an8}and things are getting messy.

00:19.986 --> 00:21.955
{\an8}They're coming
in with a vengeance.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.457
{\an8}(announcer)
Chad turned up the heat with
Morgan in the hot tub.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.993
{\an8}But she quickly
ditched him for Jay,

00:27.060 --> 00:28.528
{\an8}the ex who got away.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.364
{\an8}You're so cute.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.364
{\an8}I'm (bleep) cute.

00:31.431 --> 00:34.267
{\an8}(announcer)
Malcolm and Maya were
looking like class couple

00:34.334 --> 00:36.369
{\an8}until they both had exes arrive.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.739
{\an8}Maya seems to be rekindling
things with her ex, Kareem...

00:39.806 --> 00:42.442
{\an7}You better
give me one.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.442
{\an9}All right.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.078
{\an8}(announcer)
...while putting things
on hold with Malcolm.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.614
{\an8}When Cheyenne got sick
of Farrah's whining,

00:47.680 --> 00:50.250
{\an8}he threw out
the mother of all insults.

00:50.316 --> 00:54.554
{\an7}I didn't have to (bleep)
give birth to somebody to
(bleep) make ratings.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.390
{\an8}(announcer)
And in the end
all will be exposed,

00:57.457 --> 01:00.427
{\an8}culminating
in the ultimate test.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.595
{\an8}(man)
Are you completely
over your ex?

01:02.662 --> 01:04.164

{\an8}(announcer)
You won't believe
what's in store tonight.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.067
{\an8}Cheyenne's fight with Farrah

01:08.134 --> 01:10.637
{\an8}lands him in hot water
with Chad and Malcolm.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.238
{\an7}Don't do that (bleep),
Cheyenne.

01:12.305 --> 01:13.473
{\an8}Don't act like
I'm an ass(bleep)

Maya's ex, Kareem, spreads
a nasty rumor about her,

{\an8}She can say whatever she wants

{\an8}I just don't have a tolerance

{\an8}(announcer)
...Maya and her ex, Kareem,

02:06.259 --> 02:07.894
{\an8}are in the Shack of Secrets,

02:07.961 --> 02:10.864
{\an8}a room in the house that airs

02:22.275 --> 02:25.078
{\an8}<i>But I think the most</i>

02:28.748 --> 02:31.050
{\an8}It's just some things
you just gotta, like...

02:31.117 --> 02:34.320
{\an8}No, Farrah has been badgering
everybody behind the scenes.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.122
You can't get on
the same page as me.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.991
{\an8}So I can't talk to you.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.826
And that's you.
That's your (bleep)-up brain.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.095
So, I need to talk to somebody
else because you're not--

02:42.161 --> 02:44.564
Your brain's not
where I am right now.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.000
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep)
who I'm talking to.

02:47.066 --> 02:50.537
{\an8}I guess I can't work with people
who are (bleep) unworkable.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.973
{\an7}Abusing everybody
all day long.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.575
{\an7}And I understand
that it's about me.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.110
{\an8}I will never give up.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.946
{\an7}And I will never stop defending
what's true and right.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.215
{\an8}When I've got something to say,
I mean it for a reason.

03:02.282 --> 03:05.184
{\an8}I'll defend it to the death.
I'm not going away.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.854
{\an8}<i>And the worst thing</i>

03:07.921 --> 03:09.889
{\an8}<i>is that you were just the bet.</i>

03:09.956 --> 03:12.992
{\an8}<i>He bet the football team</i>

03:13.059 --> 03:16.262
{\an8}Don't, don't.
Don't touch me.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.564
{\an8}You know that I am a queen.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.399
{\an8}I even demeaned myself
by dating you.

03:19.465 --> 03:22.001
{\an8}So for you to tell your cousin
that I'm overrated,

03:22.068 --> 03:24.203
{\an8}that I'm stuck up
and that literally you only

03:24.270 --> 03:27.273
{\an8}wanted to be with me for a bet,
(bleep) you.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.143
{\an8}So, that's obviously not true.

03:30.209 --> 03:33.880
{\an8}I had just got out the dog house
and my own (bleep) blood

03:33.947 --> 03:35.648
{\an8}sent me into
the dog house again.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.517
{\an8}Okay, so she's lying.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.517
{\an7}Like...

03:37.584 --> 03:39.352
{\an8}I want you to
say Ashley lied.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.352
{\an5}I just literally said

03:39.419 --> 03:43.122
{\an7}everything that Ashley
is saying is a lie.

03:39.419 --> 03:43.122
{\an6}Okay, wow.

03:43.189 --> 03:46.459
{\an8}I make sure I get my ass
to the Shack of Secrets curtain

03:46.526 --> 03:47.594
{\an8}to go ahead and, like, find out,

03:47.660 --> 03:49.429
{\an8}like, the gossip.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.431
{\an8}I'm so here for this tea, honey.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.633
{\an8}Because this tea is hot.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.634
{\an8}Oh, (bleep).

03:54.701 --> 03:56.936
{\an8}(distant talking)

04:03.009 --> 04:04.744
{\an8}No, I'm not going upstairs.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.279
{\an8}Yeah, you're not gonna talk
(bleep) to a girl's face

04:06.346 --> 04:07.614
{\an8}about her (bleep) kid, dude.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.915
{\an8}You don't do
that (bleep), Cheyenne.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.483
{\an8}It's like,
how (bleep) old are you?

04:10.550 --> 04:12.852
{\an8}Grow up, you're-- you don't have
to (bleep) scream (bleep).

04:12.919 --> 04:14.354
{\an8}What the (bleep)
did you just do?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.089
{\an8}Don't act like I'm an (bleep)
when you're the one

04:16.154 --> 04:19.325
{\an8}that (bleep)--
oh, okay, I'ma say
the wrong word?!

04:19.392 --> 04:21.194
{\an8}Oh, you're gonna turn it around!
The (bleep) dip(bleep)

04:21.260 --> 04:23.496
{\an8}is yelling at a woman,
talking about her baby.

04:23.563 --> 04:24.931
{\an8}I didn't say
anything about a baby.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.333
{\an8}Yeah, you were (bleep)
about her goddamn life.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.069
{\an8}Cheyenne yelling at Farrah
is pretty (bleep) up.

04:30.136 --> 04:31.871
{\an8}So, I felt the need to get
in the middle of it, like...

04:31.938 --> 04:34.207
{\an8}I felt like he needed to know
you're not supposed

04:34.273 --> 04:35.241
{\an8}to talk to a girl like that.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.643
{\an8}(overlapping shouting)

04:36.709 --> 04:38.645
{\an8}Take your stupid Hollywood

04:43.349 --> 04:45.652

04:43.349 --> 04:45.652
{\an8}You love me.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.086
{\an8}No, I don't.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.086
{\an8}You do.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.588
{\an8}Bye.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.726
{\an8}Cheers to the good
and bad times.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.696
{\an8}(indistinct chatter)

04:56.763 --> 04:58.364
{\an8}It's on blast.

04:58.431 --> 05:01.100
{\an8}I'm guessing the Shack of
Secrets is where you just air

05:01.167 --> 05:03.803
{\an8}your dirty laundry
and maybe have some closure.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.173
{\an8}I really have nothing secretive
for the Shack.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.975
{\an8}So, I don't think
I'll be there ever.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.511
{\an8}I support all the others
who go down there.

05:11.577 --> 05:12.779
{\an8}Good luck.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.718
{\an7}Farrah, I have the balls
enough to say this.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.019
{\an8}I apologize.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.019
{\an7}Yes.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.555
{\an8}If I offended
you as a mother.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.555
{\an8}Okay.

05:22.622 --> 05:23.890
{\an8}I did not...

05:22.622 --> 05:23.890
{\an8}I appreciate that.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.992
{\an7}And I just wanted to say
if I said anything

05:26.059 --> 05:30.063
{\an7}and if I upset you,
I apologize for my
little asking

05:30.129 --> 05:32.365
{\an7}of stuff and the
frustrations today...

05:32.432 --> 05:34.701
{\an8}You can just be,
like, come on.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.701
{\an5}Voicing my frustrations...

05:34.767 --> 05:36.002
{\an8}We're all here
together, okay?

05:34.767 --> 05:36.002
{\an4}Okay.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.805
{\an8}I'm happy and I'm, you know...

05:38.871 --> 05:40.306
{\an8}I don't want
anyone upset.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.306
{\an9}I'm sorry.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.874
{\an8}You should have a good time.
You should enjoy your time.

05:41.941 --> 05:43.209
{\an8}I appreciate his apology.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.378
{\an8}I know that took probably
a lot for him.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.314
{\an8}And I appreciate that
he's acknowledging it,
recognizing it.

05:48.381 --> 05:52.785
{\an8}And he's becoming a better man.
Go, Cheyenne.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.287
{\an8}I appreciate it.

05:57.924 --> 05:59.592
{\an8}What happened?

05:57.924 --> 05:59.592

05:59.659 --> 06:02.361
{\an8}overwhelmed so soon.

06:02.428 --> 06:06.199
{\an7}Basically, his cousin
made a video telling me

06:06.265 --> 06:07.934
{\an7}the reason why he got
with you was that

06:08.000 --> 06:09.268
{\an7}it was a bet with
the football Taekwondo.

06:09.335 --> 06:11.871
{\an7}That he could pull you.
And then the irony...

06:11.938 --> 06:13.940
{\an8}What?!

06:11.938 --> 06:13.940
{\an8}Yeah, yeah.

06:14.006 --> 06:17.443
{\an8}You need me to fight your
battles, girl... what's up?

06:17.510 --> 06:19.645
{\an8}Like, I got you.

06:20.613 --> 06:21.581
{\an8}Wanna go outside, bro?

06:21.647 --> 06:23.282
{\an8}Might as well.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.521
{\an7}Like, this is too much.
I'm over it.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.057
{\an7}You come down and you talking
to my ex... about what?

06:31.124 --> 06:33.993
{\an8}Malcolm, where you at, dude?!
Like, you've been

06:34.060 --> 06:36.596
{\an8}all up her ass since day one.

06:36.662 --> 06:38.731
{\an8}And where is he?
With Kareem.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.933
{\an8}What happened down there?

06:38.798 --> 06:40.933
{\an8}How was the Shizzle
of Secrizzles?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.370
{\an8}His cousin made a whole video
basically telling me

06:44.437 --> 06:47.740
{\an7}the reason why he got
with you was that it was
a bet with the football team.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.142
{\an8}That he could pull you.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.043
{\an8}A bet?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.043
{\an7}Yeah.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.079
{\an8}I believe cold-heartedly
that Kareem

06:53.146 --> 06:55.281
{\an8}is just not
a good person at all.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.283
{\an8}Like, he's just disgusting
down to his core.

06:57.350 --> 07:01.020
{\an8}And I think he's dusty.
Like, he's gross... ew.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.956
{\an8}I don't know how
to feel about it.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.226

07:38.090 --> 07:40.059
{\an8}and confronting your ex.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.061
{\an8}But if we're gonna
go ahead and be friends,

07:42.128 --> 07:44.664
{\an8}Malcolm needs to earn that.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.365
{\an8}(Malcolm)
That's the only reason
why I got upset,

07:46.432 --> 07:47.400
{\an8}'cause you know, like...

07:47.466 --> 07:49.368
{\an7}Hey.

07:47.466 --> 07:49.368
{\an8}Hey, girl, hey.

07:49.435 --> 07:50.369
{\an8}(indistinct chatter)

07:50.436 --> 07:52.104
{\an8}Oh!

07:52.171 --> 07:53.239
{\an9}(laughter)

07:53.306 --> 07:54.774
{\an7}(Diandra)
Um...

07:54.841 --> 07:56.809
{\an8}(Maya)
I see why you just
been out here chillin'.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.010
{\an7}Chillin'!

07:58.077 --> 07:59.445
{\an8}(Malcolm)
It's a vibe right now.

07:59.512 --> 08:00.880
{\an8}(Maya)
Spaced out.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.615
{\an8}Where you at,
babe?

08:02.682 --> 08:04.116
{\an8}Nah.

08:04.183 --> 08:06.886
{\an8}Some of my friends are
people who actually care.

08:08.354 --> 08:09.422
{\an8}Don't even.

08:09.488 --> 08:12.225
{\an8}I feel like
Malcom's energy shifted.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.894
{\an8}I've only come first in all
my relationships.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.562
{\an8}I don't do second option.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.732
{\an8}And with Malcolm, it's clear
that that's how he's treating me

08:19.799 --> 08:21.300
{\an8}and I don't like it.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.102
{\an8}But anyway...

08:23.169 --> 08:25.338
{\an8}No, I just came
out here to just see
what was going on.

08:25.404 --> 08:26.806
{\an8}I wanna see where
everybody's at.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.575
{\an8}Get my feet wet
in everybody's business.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.577
{\an8}(Malcolm)
I'm happy me and Diandra
are getting along right now,

08:31.644 --> 08:34.647
{\an8}as friends, but, uh,
Maya's been a little distant.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.383
{\an8}She is angry and pissed off,
so I'm in the dog house.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.453
{\an8}So tonight, I know where
I'm not sleeping-- with Maya.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.488
{\an8}(mouth full)
All right, it's time to go.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.657
{\an8}(Diandra)
I definitely don't
care about Maya

08:44.724 --> 08:46.392
{\an8}if she cares
that I'm gonna go ahead

08:46.459 --> 08:48.361
{\an8}and have a conversation
with my ex-boyfriend.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.263
{\an8}You don't like it, that sounds
like a personal problem to me.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.332
{\an8}Good night, babe.
See you in the morning.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.035
{\an8}♪♪

08:56.102 --> 08:57.436
{\an7}(Morgan)
You're just...

08:57.503 --> 08:59.105
{\an8}(Jay)
An idiot?
(laughing)

08:59.171 --> 09:01.774
{\an7}Oh, why do you have to be
so dumb? Why do I like you?

09:01.841 --> 09:03.309
{\an8}I don't know.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.644
{\an7}I had a good feeling
you were showing up today.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.845
{\an8}Really?

09:05.912 --> 09:08.114
{\an7}But I was, like,
you know what? Maybe...

09:08.180 --> 09:10.716
{\an8}My life's gonna go a little
easy and not messy, for once.

09:10.783 --> 09:13.119
{\an7}(Jay)
Got messy last night when
you hooked up with Chad.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.321
{\an7}A simple hello with
your tongue is, like...

09:15.388 --> 09:16.989
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.125
{\an8}Don't hello people
with your tongue, please.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.295
{\an8}(Morgan)
Um, I think if, I, like,
was really vibing,

09:22.361 --> 09:25.464
{\an8}I probably would have slept in
the same bed as him last night.

09:25.531 --> 09:26.465
{\an8}(long sigh)

09:26.532 --> 09:28.301
{\an8}I love this conversation.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.937
{\an8}(Jay)
Chad never stood a chance,
bro, like, I'm sorry, dude.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.471
{\an8}It's gonna be smooth
sailing from here.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.941
{\an8}Like, I don't have to deal
with anyone, I'm chilling.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.242
{\an8}And here we are.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.344
{\an8}And I'm your
favorite ex, right?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.446
{\an8}You're my only ex
in here.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.014
{\an8}Bull... (bleep).

09:42.081 --> 09:44.583
{\an8}(announcer)
The only ex for now, that is.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.086
{\an8}Maya's still reeling
from what went down

09:47.153 --> 09:51.490
{\an8}in the Shack of Secrets,
and Malcolm and Kareem
are sleeping alone.

09:51.557 --> 09:56.562
{\an8}But Morgan and Jay turned
a bad day into a happy ending.

09:56.629 --> 09:59.532
{\an8}♪♪

10:05.104 --> 10:07.239
{\an7}(Kareem)
It's, like, everybody hates me

10:07.306 --> 10:08.607
{\an8}for the most part but they...

10:08.674 --> 10:09.608
{\an8}Nobody hates you.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.643
{\an7}Yeah, nobody
hates you, man.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.011
{\an8}You're really
overthinking it.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.848
{\an8}If Maya is upset with you,
it's your job

10:15.915 --> 10:17.450
{\an8}to make her
un-upset with you.

10:17.516 --> 10:20.886
{\an8}The Shack of Secrets
was... hell.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.156
{\an8}So, what do you think?
I just fall back and just
act like I don't care?

10:24.223 --> 10:26.425
{\an7}I mean, aside-- I mean,
aside from if you

10:26.492 --> 10:28.327
{\an8}actually think you can,
like, reconnect with her

10:28.394 --> 10:31.964
{\an7}and, like, actually
get her to, like, genuinely
give you a shot.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.466
{\an9}Yeah.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.466
{\an8}You know what I mean?

10:33.532 --> 10:35.134
{\an8}When we were
fighting,
feeds her.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.936
{\an8}Kareem is annoying.
He's just constantly

10:37.003 --> 10:39.605
{\an8}talking about his whole
situation with Maya.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.707
{\an8}If you really like this
guy that was your chance

10:41.774 --> 10:42.842
{\an8}to bring him in...

10:41.774 --> 10:42.842
{\an7}Right.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.477
{\an8}She's an animal.

10:44.543 --> 10:46.979
{\an8}I'm gonna have to take
these gloves off.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.014
{\an9}So what do
you think?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.849
{\an8}I don't care.

10:49.915 --> 10:52.118
{\an8}I'm gonna have to figure
something out.

10:52.184 --> 10:55.621

{\an8}My name is Corey Brooks,

{\an8}And, yeah, I dated Morgan.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.948
{\an8}Hey, Morgan!
You look great!

12:29.014 --> 12:33.853
{\an8}You might recognize me from
season 18 of "Big Brother."

12:33.919 --> 12:35.387
{\an8}I'm in Malibu
to find a girlfriend.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.556
{\an8}I haven't had a lot of issues
hooking up with chicks.

12:37.623 --> 12:38.991
{\an8}I just walk up and I say,

12:39.058 --> 12:40.960
{\an8}"How do you like your eggs
cooked in the morning?"

12:41.026 --> 12:42.495

12:44.964 --> 12:48.834

12:48.901 --> 12:51.203
{\an8}Morgan and I really
like each other,

12:51.270 --> 12:53.239
{\an8}but one night we were
out with just friends

12:53.305 --> 12:56.342
{\an8}and Morgan just completely,
like, embarrasses me.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.610
{\an8}And then we broke up.

12:57.676 --> 12:59.512
{\an8}I'm ready to push
people's buttons.

12:59.578 --> 13:01.213
{\an8}I wanna flirt with everyone.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.950
{\an8}But also I'm interested to see
what Morgan and I have there,

13:05.017 --> 13:07.219
{\an8}and see if there's a flame
still there to rekindle.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.787
{\an8}Shaking things up.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.828
{\an8}This is Morgan's
ex on the beach.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.898

{\an8}Oh, that's (bleep),
come on, Corey!

13:27.206 --> 13:30.009
{\an8}(Jozea)
I know Corey from "Big Brother."
And that's my man.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.912
{\an8}He's kind, he's sweet.
But, poor Morgan.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.947
{\an8}He's a single.
He's also your ex.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.649
{\an8}So that means
if you get tired of him,

13:36.715 --> 13:38.317
{\an8}you can't get rid of him anyway.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.686
{\an8}So, you gotta figure out what
the (bleep) you gonna do.

Here's the deal with Morgan.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.960
Morgan made out with Chad

13:48.027 --> 13:49.895
{\an8}but the next morning,
her ex, Jay, showed up.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.597
{\an8}She ditched Chad for Jay.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.566
{\an8}But now another ex, Corey,

13:53.632 --> 13:55.668
{\an8}joined the house as a single.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.369
{\an8}Oh, Morgan, what a tangled

13:57.436 --> 13:59.705
{\an8}web you weave.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.807
{\an8}Just bring 'em all in.

14:01.874 --> 14:05.978
{\an8}Corey Brooks makes me feel
every single emotion.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.813
{\an8}I'm, like, I have no idea
how to feel with him.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.516
{\an8}I'm a hot mess, like,
melting on the floor.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.619
{\an8}Like, somebody
send my therapist!

14:13.686 --> 14:14.787
{\an8}Hey, Morgan.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.088
{\an9}Hi, Corey

14:14.853 --> 14:16.088
{\an8}You gonna give me a hug?

14:16.155 --> 14:19.992
{\an7}Aw, you gonna--
you gonna give me a kiss?

14:20.059 --> 14:21.860
{\an9}Ohh!

14:20.059 --> 14:21.860
{\an8}Go say hi to the
rest of the house.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.095
{\an8}Don't annoy me just yet.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.597
{\an8}I know this guy.

14:24.663 --> 14:26.899
{\an8}He hangs out with all the
douchebags from "The Bachelor."

14:26.966 --> 14:30.269
{\an8}He is a total douche tickler.

14:32.071 --> 14:35.641
{\an8}Uh, that's not
the (bleep) phrase.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.209
{\an8}It is now.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.211
{\an8}Hey, Corey?

14:37.276 --> 14:39.211
{\an8}Yeah.

14:39.278 --> 14:40.879
{\an8}Let's be real right now.
What do you hope

14:40.946 --> 14:43.182
{\an8}to accomplish with Morgan here?

14:43.249 --> 14:45.684
{\an8}Oh, my God.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.686
{\an8}What's up,
handsome?

14:45.751 --> 14:47.686
{\an5}What are we trying to
accomplish? I don't know.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.355
{\an8}(Romeo)
Well, look,
this what I wanna do.

14:49.421 --> 14:53.859
{\an8}I want Morgan and Corey to go
and talk, figure things out.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.628
{\an7}This is really
rude, Romeo.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.029
{\an8}I'll see the rest
of y'all later.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.697
{\an8}Come on, we're
going to talk.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.499
{\an8}Morgan, I missed you.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.499
{\an8}Shut up.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.002
{\an8}(Nicole)
I think what Jay has going for
him is his awesome personality,

15:03.068 --> 15:05.938
{\an8}and I think that he can keep
Morgan entertained with that.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.674
{\an8}But Corey's, like,
really good-looking, like...

15:08.741 --> 15:10.509
{\an8}Damn, Morgan, you're doing good.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.345
{\an8}Are you gonna get with him?
Or is he up for grabs?

15:13.412 --> 15:16.315
{\an8}(chatter)

15:13.412 --> 15:16.315
{\an8}What can I do?

15:16.382 --> 15:18.250
{\an8}Can't control people.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.319
{\an8}♪♪

15:20.386 --> 15:22.921
{\an7}All right, so is Jay, like,
if that's, like, a thing

15:22.988 --> 15:24.556
{\an8}right now, do I need
to, like, back off?

15:24.623 --> 15:26.558
{\an7}You tell me, I don't know,
if you really like this dude.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.261
{\an7}I do really
like him.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.261
{\an5}More than me?

15:29.328 --> 15:32.064
{\an7}God...

15:29.328 --> 15:32.064
{\an8}What does he have
that I don't have?

15:32.131 --> 15:34.433
{\an8}Hmm...

15:34.500 --> 15:36.802
{\an8}She tries to hide it
but I see right through it.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.570
{\an8}Morgan definitely has
feelings for me still.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.072
{\an8}She'll be running back.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.241
{\an8}With Jay, it's, like, I know
he's interested in me 'cause

15:42.308 --> 15:44.743
{\an8}he can pull me aside and be,
like, hey, like, I like you.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.412
{\an8}Okay, I feel like
it's just obvious.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.347
{\an8}Like, I feel like I've shown
interest in you, like, taking

15:48.414 --> 15:50.182
{\an8}you on dates, like,
that means I like you.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.785
{\an7}I don't have to, like, stare...
"Oh, my God, I like you."

15:52.851 --> 15:53.886
{\an8}You know, like...

15:52.851 --> 15:53.886
{\an8}Okay.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.187
{\an8}That's not my personality.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.755
{\an7}You know what? Yeah,
maybe I'm being sensitive

15:56.822 --> 15:59.091
{\an7}about wanting to know
how a guy feels about me.

15:59.158 --> 16:02.928
{\an8}I just don't know
what to do because...

16:02.995 --> 16:05.097
{\an8}Jay's a great guy, but,
like, Corey's here

16:05.164 --> 16:07.099
{\an8}and it's, like,
I have feelings for him.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.768
{\an8}God, I don't want
to start crying.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.270
{\an7}We're not
gonna be weird.

16:11.337 --> 16:12.338
{\an8}Let's see what happens.

16:12.404 --> 16:13.806
{\an8}We'll see what happens.

16:13.872 --> 16:15.674
{\an8}Don't mess up my life.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.242
{\an8}I'm trying to have
a little bit of respect.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.346
{\an8}But if he does slip up,
Jay better keep his girl close

16:20.412 --> 16:23.649
{\an8}or it's not gonna be safe.
It's just not.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.084
{\an8}I can't stop
looking at you, Morgan.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.318
{\an9}Shut up.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.687
{\an8}♪ Took a long time
to get here ♪

16:28.754 --> 16:31.223
{\an8}♪ But you know what they say ♪

16:31.290 --> 16:33.092
{\an8}♪ Change don't

16:36.862 --> 16:39.798
{\an8}(Chad)
I take the same supplements
every day, the same protein.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.434
{\an8}So I only drink vodka.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.434
{\an8}You're (bleep) boring.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.970
{\an8}(announcer)
My grandma always said only
boring people get bored.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.973
{\an8}So here's a little
excitement for you.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.475
{\an8}(loud blaring alert)

16:49.541 --> 16:51.777
{\an8}Oh (bleep)!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.579
{\an8}Oh, bitch!
The totem!

16:53.645 --> 16:57.049
{\an8}A noise comes and it's just,
like, the most dark,

16:57.116 --> 16:58.951
{\an8}ominous tone you've ever heard
in your life

16:59.017 --> 17:01.019
{\an8}where it's... bong!

17:01.086 --> 17:03.455
{\an8}(announcer)
This group of reality stars

17:03.522 --> 17:06.458
{\an8}would normally love to see their
faces on the big screen.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.093
{\an8}But this is one exception

17:08.160 --> 17:12.196
{\an8}because it means your ex might
be washing up on the beach.

17:12.263 --> 17:13.699
{\an8}Whoa!

17:13.766 --> 17:15.134
{\an8}It's a totem of terror, man.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.635
{\an8}I know what that (bleep) means.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.470
{\an8}It ain't good and I don't
want my face to pop up

17:18.537 --> 17:20.406
{\an8}nowhere on it.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.344
{\an8}(all)
Ohh!

17:25.411 --> 17:28.046
{\an8}Ohh...

17:29.581 --> 17:31.817
{\an8}Ohh (bleep)!

17:31.884 --> 17:34.286
{\an8}Oh my God!

17:34.353 --> 17:37.156
{\an8}I think the ex coming
today is Darien.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.992
{\an8}I've never loved anyone
more than I loved Darien.

17:40.058 --> 17:43.896
{\an8}Like, I need him
for (bleep) and comfort.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.664
{\an8}And not-- and not in that order

17:45.731 --> 17:48.100
{\an8}because (bleep)
can be comforting, too.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.401
{\an8}Aww...

17:49.468 --> 17:53.038
{\an8}(all screaming)

17:53.105 --> 17:54.406
{\an8}I wanna go back
to the beach.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.942
{\an8}I don't know
why my face came up.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.044
{\an8}I'm really nervous
and I really hope,

17:59.111 --> 18:01.313
{\an8}like, no one shows up
for me today.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.548
{\an8}It's nerve-wracking.

18:02.614 --> 18:03.916
{\an8}Hey, good luck, man.

18:03.982 --> 18:07.252
{\an8}We've got potentially three more
dudes coming in.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.521
{\an8}Just hanging out
with dudes all day.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.923
{\an8}800 (bleep) everywhere.

18:10.989 --> 18:13.058
{\an8}There's (bleep),
(bleep), (bleep), (bleep).

18:13.125 --> 18:15.761
{\an8}There's (bleep) in every room.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.497
{\an8}And I respect the (bleep).

18:18.564 --> 18:19.765
{\an8}Cheyenne, give 'em hell!

18:19.832 --> 18:21.700
{\an8}He fanned his armpits.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.535
{\an8}(all laughing)

18:30.409 --> 18:33.145
{\an7}Our totem pole
has brought us here.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.180
{\an8}(Romeo)
Party has arrived.

18:36.815 --> 18:40.085
{\an8}Cheyenne, Farrah and Janelle.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.254
{\an8}Welcome back to the beach, baby.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.156
{\an8}I'm nervous.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.156
{\an7}(bleep).

18:42.321 --> 18:44.156
{\an5}I don't blame y'all.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.992
{\an8}Y'all came to Malibu thinking
y'all find a new boo.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.895
{\an8}But it turns out,
that's not exactly the case.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.231
{\an8}Because your exes are showing up
left and right.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.132
{\an8}By the end of this whole
experience,

18:54.199 --> 18:56.635
{\an8}some of you may find new love.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.537
{\an8}Rekindle with an old love.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.138
{\an8}Or just say (bleep) love.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.741
{\an8}But the beauty
of this journey...

19:02.808 --> 19:04.510
{\an8}we can finally find out for sure

19:04.576 --> 19:06.912
{\an8}if you could ever
truly get over your ex.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.313
{\an8}Yeah, maybe.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.183
{\an8}All right, y'all,
let's get the first ex

19:11.250 --> 19:12.618
{\an8}to come out of the water.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.459
{\an8}(Farrah)
Oh my God.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.402
{\an8}All right, y'all.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.402
{\an8}Whoo!

19:30.469 --> 19:33.705
{\an8}The first ex coming
out of the water is...

19:39.678 --> 19:43.682
{\an8}The past is in the past for me.
I don't wanna see anyone there.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.657
{\an8}Ahh!

19:51.723 --> 19:54.960
{\an8}That man thong is definitely
coming for Cheyenne.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.028
{\an8}Oh, (bleep).

19:58.797 --> 20:01.500
{\an8}I'm Murray, I'm from L.A.,
and I'm Cheyenne's ex.

20:01.567 --> 20:04.269
{\an8}I'm a model.
(chuckling)

20:04.336 --> 20:05.904
{\an8}I might as well
be in "The Matrix"

20:05.971 --> 20:07.940
{\an8}because I'm dodging all these
DMs of boys hitting me up.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.609
{\an8}Me and Cheyenne dated
for about a year and a half.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.045
{\an8}He thought that
I had cheated on him.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.780
{\an8}I may have gotten
a (bleep) from somebody.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.548
{\an8}So, we decided to take a break.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.383
{\an8}And we never got back together
after that.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.152
{\an8}But we have a lot of sexual
tension between each other.

20:20.218 --> 20:22.120
{\an8}And when I was dating another
boy named Cory,

20:22.187 --> 20:24.957
{\an8}Cheyenne and I were still having
sex on the side.

20:25.023 --> 20:27.593
{\an8}There's definitely a chunk of my
heart that loves Cheyenne.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.761
{\an8}And I know Cheyenne
is still in love with me.

20:29.828 --> 20:33.298
{\an8}I think it's...
time we kind of figure it out.

20:33.365 --> 20:36.134
{\an8}♪ The gloves are coming off ♪

20:37.736 --> 20:40.606
{\an8}Is that you?

20:37.736 --> 20:40.606
{\an8}(laughing)

20:40.672 --> 20:42.708
{\an8}When I was dating Murray there
was just a lot of rumors

20:42.774 --> 20:45.377
{\an8}swirling around
about cheating and...

20:45.444 --> 20:48.647
{\an8}I mean, Murray might say
that he didn't cheat but

20:48.714 --> 20:52.718
{\an8}I definitely have a little
blue check verified.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.653
{\an8}Me and Cheyenne
have always had this weird

20:54.720 --> 20:57.556
{\an8}sexual relationship
after our relationship.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.626
{\an8}And I think it's time
to just figure out

21:00.692 --> 21:02.160
{\an8}is that part
of our life history?

21:02.227 --> 21:05.964
{\an8}Or is there still history there
that we wanna continue?

21:06.031 --> 21:07.699
{\an7}Well, Murray, Cheyenne,
I think you two need

21:07.766 --> 21:09.534
{\an7}some time alone
to see where you stand.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.803
{\an8}Welcome to the beach!

21:11.870 --> 21:13.772
{\an8}Yeah, welcome.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.772
{\an8}Welcome.

21:13.839 --> 21:14.906
{\an8}Hi, ladies.

21:14.973 --> 21:15.907
{\an8}Ohh...

21:15.974 --> 21:17.843
{\an8}Yeah.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.578
{\an8}Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

21:19.645 --> 21:20.912
{\an8}Y'all can relax for now.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.981
{\an7}That's all the exes
washing up today.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.182
{\an8}Whoo!

21:24.249 --> 21:25.517
{\an8}(cheering)

21:25.584 --> 21:27.586
{\an8}My ex didn't show up.
Yes.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.921
{\an8}And I'm so happy about that.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.824
{\an8}Things just work out.
-- power.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.263
{\an7}So, what are
you doing here?

21:38.330 --> 21:41.800
{\an7}You know, I feel like we just
have this crazy connection.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.135
{\an8}And I know you know that.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.370
{\an7}Getting a phone call
from your ex, telling me

21:45.437 --> 21:47.673
{\an8}that you cheated
on me with him,

21:47.739 --> 21:51.610
{\an7}put me in a position to just
not trust you as much.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.245
{\an8}I was very much
in love, though.

21:53.311 --> 21:56.915
{\an8}And it's taken a few duds,

21:56.982 --> 22:00.118
{\an7}not a few,
quite a lot, actually...

22:00.185 --> 22:02.154
{\an8}I don't wanna put
any expectations

22:02.220 --> 22:03.689
{\an8}on this experience
at all but...

22:02.220 --> 22:03.689
{\an7}I'm not...

22:03.755 --> 22:05.957
{\an8}Expectations, I just
wanna make sure that

22:06.024 --> 22:07.826
{\an7}if we're being that
open and honest,

22:07.893 --> 22:09.528
{\an8}that we remain that way.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.528
{\an9}Yeah.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.096
{\an7}You know?

22:09.594 --> 22:11.096
{\an9}Totally.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.898
{\an8}I'd be willing to explore
things with Murray again.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.267
{\an8}I just have an underlying fear
that I'll get my heart

22:15.333 --> 22:18.036
{\an8}broken again and it's not
something that I'm really

22:18.103 --> 22:20.338
{\an8}emotionally equipped
for right now.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.240
{\an7}I like our
sexual connection.

22:22.307 --> 22:25.677
{\an7}Can we just keep
that actually, please?

22:22.307 --> 22:25.677
{\an5}Yeah, we can.

22:25.744 --> 22:29.147
{\an8}We need a hut, actually,
with a door and a lock.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.950
{\an8}No lock needed.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.950
{\an7}No lock?

22:32.017 --> 22:34.586
{\an8}You like people...

22:32.017 --> 22:34.586
{\an8}I like to keep it.

22:34.653 --> 22:37.489
{\an8}You really have evolved.

22:34.653 --> 22:37.489
{\an9}(laughing)

22:37.556 --> 22:39.157
{\an8}Keep it guessing.
Good to see you, baby.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.498
{\an8}(announcer)
While Cheyenne decides
whether his damaged heart

22:46.565 --> 22:48.767
{\an8}can take another
round with Murray,

22:48.834 --> 22:51.002
{\an8}Malcolm's doing damage control
with Maya.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.637
{\an8}Talk to me about
what's going on.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.106
{\an8}Just felt like
at the end
of the day,

22:54.172 --> 22:55.941
{\an7}me and you have a connection,
I just feel like

22:56.007 --> 22:57.642
{\an7}you shoulda checked on me.
Like, I just-- that's just--

22:57.709 --> 23:00.112
{\an8}That was my issue and
that was why I was upset.

23:00.178 --> 23:01.313
{\an8}My feelings
are hurt that Malcolm

23:01.379 --> 23:02.948
{\an8}didn't come and check on me.

23:03.014 --> 23:04.816
{\an8}I just felt like, okay, if you
really cared and you know

23:04.883 --> 23:07.652
{\an8}something's wrong with me 'cause
I know you see it on my face,

23:07.719 --> 23:09.254
{\an8}'cause I know I show it.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.254
{\an8}Baby, you gotta understand.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.289
{\an8}I don't know everything
about you, come on, now.

23:11.356 --> 23:14.126
{\an7}Like, it's only
been one day.

23:11.356 --> 23:14.126
{\an5}So you gon'
sit here and say

23:14.192 --> 23:16.762
{\an8}that you did not know
that I was upset.

23:16.828 --> 23:19.231
{\an7}I could've done so
much better yesterday.

23:19.297 --> 23:21.933
{\an8}I manned up.
Put my pride to the side.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.568
{\an8}And I feel like we can
move forward from this.

23:23.635 --> 23:26.972
{\an8}And we could just, you know,
put the past behind the past,

23:27.038 --> 23:29.407
{\an8}understand each other
and communicate more.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.843
{\an8}But even if it doesn't work
and me and her are just friends,

23:31.910 --> 23:34.212
{\an8}like, I feel, like,
we can help each other grow.

23:34.279 --> 23:38.016
{\an8}I guess we're cool again.
You did make me really
mad, though.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.852
{\an8}(announcer)
Speaking of stable
relationships,

23:40.919 --> 23:43.288
{\an8}let's see how
jealous Jay's feeling

23:43.355 --> 23:45.090
{\an8}now that Corey is on the scene.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.559
{\an7}So, like, do you still
have feelings for him now?

23:47.626 --> 23:49.361
{\an8}No, and I was like,
go in the house--

23:49.427 --> 23:51.129
{\an7}For real?

23:49.427 --> 23:51.129
{\an9}No.

23:51.196 --> 23:54.132
{\an8}'Cause you got flustered.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.269
{\an7}I mean, you're in deep (bleep).
(laughing)

23:57.335 --> 23:59.538
{\an8}Am I, though, or like...
Can I just have fun?

23:59.604 --> 24:01.673
{\an8}I trust her, but
the way that she reacted

24:01.740 --> 24:04.209
{\an8}was there are feelings
inside of you

24:04.276 --> 24:05.877
{\an8}that need to come out.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.947
{\an8}And I need to find out
what those feelings are,

24:09.014 --> 24:10.949
{\an8}so that we don't leave those
doors ajar.

24:11.016 --> 24:13.385
{\an8}Like, close one of the doors
and do it quick,

24:13.451 --> 24:14.820
{\an8}'cause I don't last forever.

24:14.886 --> 24:18.123
{\an7}You can have fun, but like,
if you wanna go explore

24:18.190 --> 24:19.958
{\an7}your (bleep) horizons,
let me know.

24:20.025 --> 24:21.626
{\an8}I'm not terribly worried.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.595
{\an8}Your face says otherwise.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.231
{\an8}Can I combine Jay's personality

24:26.298 --> 24:29.868
{\an8}with Corey's, like, looks?

24:29.935 --> 24:32.204
{\an8}And then I would literally
have my perfect man.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.272
{\an8}(angelic choir)

24:36.541 --> 24:38.677
{\an8}Maybe y'all will
become best friends.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.679
{\an7}He's probably gonna try
to piss me off.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.080
{\an8}Probably.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.315
{\an8}I'm gonna love it.

24:43.381 --> 24:44.983
{\an8}I'm gonna let it ride out,

24:45.050 --> 24:46.484
{\an8}gonna let Jay have
his (bleep) fun.

24:46.551 --> 24:48.954
{\an8}So he better (bleep) make
his move while he can,

24:49.020 --> 24:52.591
{\an8}before dad comes in
and, um, takes home gold.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.859
{\an8}(chuckling)

24:53.925 --> 24:55.360
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

24:55.427 --> 24:58.129
{\an8}You're like the most negative
(bleep) man I've ever heard.

24:58.196 --> 24:59.731
{\an8}(announcer)
And later...

24:59.798 --> 25:00.966
{\an8}No straight guy should be
telling me, like,

25:01.032 --> 25:02.467
{\an8}certain things
about their girlfriend.

25:02.534 --> 25:03.802
{\an8}This is so (bleep) up.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.537
{\an8}You know that my heart...

25:05.604 --> 25:07.105
{\an8}(sobbing)

25:11.509 --> 25:13.245
{\an8}(announcer)
Welcome back.
Here's where things stand.

25:13.311 --> 25:15.981
{\an8}The Totem of Terror has popped
off for the first time,

25:16.047 --> 25:20.185
{\an8}sending Cheyenne to meet
with his unfaithful ex Murray,

25:20.252 --> 25:23.088
{\an8}and Morgan decides between
brains and beauty.

25:23.154 --> 25:26.524
{\an8}Well, personality and beauty,
at least.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.529
{\an8}Hey, hey, hey!

25:31.596 --> 25:32.731
{\an8}This is Murray.

25:32.797 --> 25:34.633
{\an8}(overlapping greetings)

25:34.699 --> 25:37.402
{\an8}My first impression
of Murray was, like... okay.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.404
{\an8}I mean... he a'ight.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.473
{\an7}What's up?
How are you? Murray.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.473
{\an5}This is Jozea.

25:41.539 --> 25:43.341
{\an8}I mean, he damn sure he ain't
better looking than me.

25:43.408 --> 25:45.110
{\an8}That's number one, let's get...

25:45.176 --> 25:46.778
{\an8}(clears throat)
Let's get that correct.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.880
{\an8}Tell us the situation?
What's going on?

25:48.947 --> 25:51.383
{\an8}He was one of my first
boyfriends in Los Angeles.

25:51.449 --> 25:55.720
{\an7}I think we got into a couple
really bad moments and...

25:55.787 --> 25:58.456
{\an8}So, we just cut
everything off

25:58.523 --> 26:01.493
{\an8}and didn't speak
for at least a year.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.161
{\an8}Yeah, like, a hear
and a half?

26:01.559 --> 26:03.161
{\an5}Maybe, maybe...

26:03.228 --> 26:04.562
{\an8}Maybe almost two-- yeah.

26:04.629 --> 26:06.364
{\an7}Y'all both have, like,
there's no animosity there.

26:06.431 --> 26:08.466
{\an8}That's beautiful,
like, y'all can...

26:08.533 --> 26:11.136
{\an8}Yeah, I'm actually
really happy you're here.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.571
{\an7}Yeah, you've been
smiling this whole time.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.571
{\an5}You're making us smile.

26:13.638 --> 26:16.107
{\an8}(Chad)
I think Cheyenne should
be real careful with Murray.

26:16.174 --> 26:17.275
{\an8}They're an ex.

26:17.342 --> 26:19.511
{\an8}How awesome can it be?

26:19.577 --> 26:21.313
{\an8}You broke up with him
for a reason.

26:21.379 --> 26:23.481
{\an8}This is Maya, Maya.

26:21.379 --> 26:23.481
{\an8}Hi.

26:23.548 --> 26:25.617
{\an8}I'm your competition.

26:23.548 --> 26:25.617
{\an8}Oh, I love it.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.319
{\an8}(laughing)

26:27.385 --> 26:28.353
{\an8}I love Cheyenne.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.022
{\an8}Let the games begin.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.022
{\an7}Yeah.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.959
{\an8}(Janelle)
It's so obvious that
Cheyenne truly, truly,

26:34.025 --> 26:35.694
{\an8}truly cares for Murray.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.896
{\an8}And I don't wanna
see my boy get played.

26:37.963 --> 26:41.666
{\an8}So, I'm waiting to see
how this all plays out.

26:41.733 --> 26:45.203
{\an8}So cheers to Murray!

26:45.270 --> 26:48.974
{\an8}Oh, good.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.974
{\an8}Welcome to the house!

26:49.040 --> 26:50.208
{\an8}New kids on the block.

26:50.275 --> 26:53.111
{\an8}And may somebody
get laid tonight.

26:53.178 --> 26:55.280
{\an8}♪♪

26:55.347 --> 26:58.550
{\an8}♪ You got me feeling like a star
when I sake up in the morning ♪

26:58.616 --> 27:03.221
{\an8}♪♪

27:08.193 --> 27:09.394
{\an8}Can I talk to you?

27:08.193 --> 27:09.394
{\an7}No.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.396
{\an8}Come on, now.
We have not got to talk.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.065
{\an8}After the Shack of Secrets,
seems like me and Maya's
situation

27:14.132 --> 27:15.800
{\an8}is going south for me, fast,

27:15.867 --> 27:18.603
{\an8}and I gotta make
something happen,

27:18.670 --> 27:21.006
{\an8}because I came here to show her
a different side of me.

27:21.072 --> 27:23.608
{\an8}I just feel like
you pretty much are stuck

27:23.675 --> 27:26.644
{\an8}with the thought
that you had
of me years ago,

27:26.711 --> 27:28.546
{\an8}and you're not
gon' let that go.

27:28.613 --> 27:29.814
{\an7}Well, you haven't
shown me any different.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.116
{\an8}And I'm paying
for this (bleep) now.

27:31.182 --> 27:32.384
{\an7}But you haven't
shown me anything.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.985
{\an8}Obviously you can tell
I care, but--

27:34.052 --> 27:35.286
{\an8}No, no, you don't.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.286
{\an9}How?

27:35.353 --> 27:36.321
{\an8}How do I not care?

27:36.388 --> 27:37.589
{\an7}Because you showed
zero effort,

27:37.655 --> 27:39.157
{\an7}so what the (bleep)
are you talking about?

27:39.224 --> 27:40.625
{\an8}Really? Zero effort?
I came here for you,

27:40.692 --> 27:42.227
{\an8}and nothing else.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.227
{\an8}Okay, no, you didn't.

27:42.293 --> 27:43.294
{\an8}Nothing else.
Nothing else.

27:43.361 --> 27:44.696
{\an8}If this is your effort,

27:44.763 --> 27:46.097
{\an8}ha, you're tripping.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.600
{\an7}Obviously you don't understand
how much I care about you,

27:48.666 --> 27:50.235
{\an7}and you don't care how much
I care about you.

27:50.301 --> 27:52.837
{\an8}I'm done.
I'm literally done,
so, if you wanna

27:52.904 --> 27:54.773
{\an8}just talk to yourself,
you can, but I'm literally

27:54.839 --> 27:56.508
{\an8}not about to respond
after this sentence.

27:56.574 --> 27:58.610
{\an8}So you that cute now?

27:58.676 --> 28:00.712
{\an7}You on some (bleep)
like that, huh?

28:06.017 --> 28:07.318

There's definitely gonna
be more exes coming.

28:17.695 --> 28:20.565
{\an8}I think the ladies can agree
that they want more options.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.567
{\an7}What about the fellas?
We don't got damn...

28:22.634 --> 28:24.536
{\an8}Y'all up each other ass,
so y'all don't need us.

28:24.602 --> 28:27.105
{\an8}Yeah, you guys are acting
like this is (bleep) friends
on the beach.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.541
{\an8}(Farrah)
They want girls, we want boys.
All I want is the date.

28:29.607 --> 28:34.112
{\an8}I'm here to date and, like,
be focused and be my best self.

28:34.179 --> 28:35.780
{\an8}We need more guys in the house.

28:35.847 --> 28:38.550
{\an8}More guys?
It's, like, 90% guys now.

28:38.616 --> 28:41.920
{\an8}You guys aren't getting
along with the girls so...

28:41.986 --> 28:44.055
{\an8}What guys aren't getting
along with what girls?

28:44.122 --> 28:45.857
{\an8}You.

28:45.924 --> 28:49.027
{\an7}You're, like, the most negative
(bleep) man I've ever heard.

28:49.094 --> 28:50.562
{\an8}What are you
talking about?

28:49.094 --> 28:50.562
{\an8}Oh, (bleep)!

28:50.628 --> 28:54.199
{\an8}Farrah, seriously?
Here we go again.

28:54.265 --> 28:56.067
{\an8}You just such a drainer.

28:56.134 --> 28:58.970
{\an7}I'm a drainer, are you
(bleep) me right now, Farrah?

28:59.037 --> 29:02.040
{\an8}Yeah, I'm living real life,
having real conversations.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.775
{\an8}She's talking about me.
She's saying, like...

29:03.842 --> 29:05.877
{\an7}I'm talking to you.
I'm not talking about you.

29:05.944 --> 29:07.645
{\an8}I'm talking to...

29:05.944 --> 29:07.645
{\an8}Well, then maybe
(bleep) look at me.

29:07.712 --> 29:09.414
{\an8}I don't have to look at you.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.649
{\an8}I don't know
if he's really a Chad.

29:11.716 --> 29:13.118
{\an8}I grew up with Chads.

29:13.184 --> 29:14.686
{\an8}I know what a Chad looks like
when I see a Chad.

29:14.752 --> 29:18.256
{\an8}Um, I just don't feel
like this is a Chad

29:18.323 --> 29:21.426
{\an8}with the same kind of...

29:21.493 --> 29:23.528
{\an8}temperament?
Like, totally different.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.830
{\an7}You're just talking (bleep)
about me right here to me
about (bleep)...

29:25.897 --> 29:27.565
{\an8}No, I'm not talking (bleep).

29:25.897 --> 29:27.565
{\an7}...that doesn't even make
any (bleep) sense.

29:27.632 --> 29:30.268
{\an8}You're telling me
I'm negative and I suck?

29:30.335 --> 29:31.803
{\an8}I just can't even deal.

29:30.335 --> 29:31.803
{\an9}Really?

29:31.870 --> 29:33.538
{\an8}(Chad)
I've done nothing
but be nice to you.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.008
{\an8}For the most part, I talked
a little bit of (bleep)

29:37.075 --> 29:38.743
{\an8}because she's a (bleep) bitch.
She's a bitch to everybody.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.311
{\an8}But that's not a big deal.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.046
{\an8}You're, like,
so (bleep) in yourself.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.749
{\an8}You need to live outside
of yourself so you can
better yourself.

29:44.816 --> 29:47.986
{\an8}The whole argument, I was going
back and forth

29:48.052 --> 29:49.721
{\an8}like a ping pong match.
I was just, like,

29:49.787 --> 29:52.690
{\an8}oh, great insult,
oh, even better, oh!

29:52.757 --> 29:54.492
{\an8}Like, I was shocked
that they could both

29:54.559 --> 29:56.194
{\an8}go tit for tat with their words.

29:56.261 --> 29:57.929
{\an8}You're so (bleep) up.

29:57.996 --> 29:59.297
{\an8}Of all people, me?

29:59.364 --> 30:02.467
{\an7}Of all people me?!
Oh, no, me?! Oh, no, me?!

30:02.534 --> 30:04.402
{\an8}So I can better
myself, Farrah?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.738
{\an8}You're like the biggest
piece of (bleep) literally
on planet Earth.

30:13.845 --> 30:15.747
{\an8}So I can better
myself, Farrah?

30:15.813 --> 30:17.482
{\an8}You're like the biggest
piece of (bleep) literally
on planet Earth.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.317
{\an7}Last time I checked
I'm not a piece of (bleep).

30:19.384 --> 30:21.219
{\an7}Why don't you go
(bleep) the cameraman again.

30:21.286 --> 30:22.754
{\an7}I don't need to, I don't need
to yell at any cameraman.

30:22.820 --> 30:24.689
{\an8}And you're so (bleep) up.

30:24.756 --> 30:27.125
{\an8}You're like the biggest
piece of (bleep) literally
on planet Earth.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.661
{\an7}Really? 'Cause last
time I checked I'm not
a piece of (bleep).

30:29.727 --> 30:31.229
{\an8}I'm an actual great person.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.064
{\an8}Okay, maybe we should hop
on Google and find out.

30:33.131 --> 30:36.668
{\an7}Oh, I should hop on Google,
and I know what's there,
and it's probably me.

30:36.734 --> 30:38.203
{\an8}(laughing)

30:38.269 --> 30:41.239
{\an8}Yeah, what are you
known for, huh?

30:41.306 --> 30:42.941
{\an1}I don't know, I'm known
for being a teen mom.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.442
I'm known for a sex tape.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.544
{\an8}She's literally famous,
like, she had a kid.

30:46.611 --> 30:50.848
{\an8}You had a kid when you were
young, like, (bleep).

30:50.915 --> 30:52.083
{\an8}I bought a car
when I was young.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.651
{\an8}Why didn't they
make a show called

30:53.718 --> 30:55.653
{\an8}Chad Has a Car and He's 16?

30:55.720 --> 30:56.955
{\an7}If you like women,
you like women.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.923
{\an7}If you hate women,
you (bleep) hate 'em, bitch.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.959
{\an8}What does that even mean?

31:01.025 --> 31:03.161
{\an8}(Chad laughs)

31:03.228 --> 31:06.297
{\an7}Like, you're a piece of (bleep).
I'm a piece of (bleep).

31:06.364 --> 31:07.699
{\an9}We all are.

31:07.765 --> 31:10.068
{\an8}One of the reasons I love...
Oh, wait, do I love her?

31:10.134 --> 31:12.103
{\an8}That's not what I meant.
Do you know what I mean?

31:12.170 --> 31:14.405
{\an8}Like, one of the reasons
I really like Nicole...

31:14.472 --> 31:16.174
{\an8}I love people that admit
they're a piece of (bleep).

31:16.241 --> 31:17.642
{\an8}Even though she's not
a piece of (bleep).

31:17.709 --> 31:20.111
{\an8}Farrah is a piece of (bleep)
and she won't admit it.

31:20.178 --> 31:21.646
{\an8}I'm not a piece of (bleep).

31:21.713 --> 31:23.114
{\an8}There's way...

31:23.181 --> 31:24.749
{\an8}There's so many (bleep)-up
people in this world.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.951
{\an8}You are far,
far from it, far.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.720
{\an8}Girl, I'm on a whole
other planet.

31:28.786 --> 31:30.922
{\an8}(announcer)
Uh, yeah.

31:30.989 --> 31:33.391
{\an8}Now that that's settled,
let's check in

31:33.458 --> 31:36.628
{\an8}on Kareem's wicked plan
to bring down Maya.

31:39.063 --> 31:42.300
{\an8}Dude, the real reason
Maya hates me...

31:42.367 --> 31:45.436
{\an8}And I've been trying not to
bring this (bleep) up, dude,

31:45.503 --> 31:47.805
{\an7}because I don't wanna taint her
image, but the real reason

31:47.872 --> 31:49.274
{\an8}she hate me is
'cause my teammate

31:49.340 --> 31:52.644
{\an8}told me she had something
that was incurable.

31:52.710 --> 31:57.582
{\an7}And, I, like, literally just...
never dealt with her again.

31:57.649 --> 32:00.351
{\an8}And Maya, now you
playing with me.
And I don't play.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.086
{\an8}(bleep) all that nice (bleep).

32:02.153 --> 32:04.322
{\an8}(bleep) closure.
I don't care anymore.

32:04.389 --> 32:05.523
{\an8}Evidently, you don't care.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.425
{\an8}So, we gonna get
down to business.

32:07.492 --> 32:08.926
{\an8}Now (bleep)
gonna get wicked.

32:08.993 --> 32:11.796
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep) anymore.

32:11.863 --> 32:13.031
{\an8}Point, blank, period.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.666
{\an8}Whatever she's going through

32:14.732 --> 32:17.201
{\an8}whether it's true or not
in her personal life

32:17.268 --> 32:19.737
{\an8}has absolutely nothing to do
with her as a person.

32:19.804 --> 32:22.173
{\an8}I also don't think you should be
talking about that.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.375
{\an8}I don't expect you
to go tell Cheyenne...

32:24.442 --> 32:29.013
{\an5}(announcer)
All right, Kareem, let me give
you a little Being Shady 101.

32:40.024 --> 32:42.327
Okay? Class dismissed.

32:42.393 --> 32:44.929
{\an7}I'm literally venting to you
because I don't have

32:44.996 --> 32:46.497
{\an8}anybody else
in the house...

32:46.564 --> 32:48.032
{\an7}All right, I feel you.
All right, I feel you,
I feel you.

32:48.099 --> 32:49.534
{\an8}This is something
that's way too big.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.970
{\an8}It's none of my business.
Not for my ears.

32:54.806 --> 32:55.940
{\an8}(bleep) yeah.

32:56.007 --> 32:57.075
{\an8}You came up on me real quick.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.876
{\an8}Sorry, girl.

32:58.943 --> 33:01.212
{\an8}As much as I don't wanna be

33:01.279 --> 33:03.748
{\an8}in the middle of this drama...

33:03.815 --> 33:06.184
{\an8}I'd really like
to stir the pot.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.819
{\an8}Your ex-boyfriend
came up to me.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.819
{\an7}Okay.

33:07.885 --> 33:09.654
{\an8}He specifically said, "Hey,
Murray, can I talk to you?"

33:09.721 --> 33:10.888
{\an8}And I was, like, yeah.

33:10.955 --> 33:13.758
{\an8}So, as soon as I hear news,
I go...

33:13.825 --> 33:17.862
{\an8}tell people and I just say,
this is between us.

33:17.929 --> 33:21.366
{\an8}He told me that Maya
has an incurable disease.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.101
{\an8}Luckily, she didn't
give it to me

33:23.167 --> 33:24.669
{\an8}but she's been giving
it to people, like,

33:24.736 --> 33:27.538
{\an7}before we started dating
and after we started dating,

33:27.605 --> 33:29.374
{\an8}she's just been doing this
blah-blah-blah-blah.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.275
{\an8}Like, no straight guy
should be telling me,

33:31.342 --> 33:32.577
{\an8}like, certain things
about their girlfriend.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.612
{\an7}It's, like, really (bleep) up.
It's just, like,

33:34.679 --> 33:36.114
{\an8}I'm wrong and I'm not.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.683
{\an7}Like, I don't understand
and it's just, like,

33:38.750 --> 33:41.386
{\an8}why are you chasing me
and now you're trying
to ruin my reputation?

33:41.452 --> 33:43.287
{\an8}Like, that's so (bleep) up.

33:43.354 --> 33:46.991
{\an7}You know that I'm bitter
and you know that my heart...

33:47.058 --> 33:48.292
{\an7}(sobbing)

33:48.359 --> 33:52.397
{\an8}It makes me feel
"furiating" inside

33:52.463 --> 33:54.499
{\an8}because as a woman, it hurts

33:54.565 --> 33:56.601
{\an8}when someone that
you used to love,

33:56.667 --> 33:59.937
{\an8}and now is just trying
to bring you down.

34:00.004 --> 34:03.307
{\an8}I'm not gonna go ahead and be
buddy-buddy with Maya,

34:03.374 --> 34:05.276
{\an8}but, like, I don't think
any girl should go through that.

34:05.343 --> 34:08.179
{\an8}This is so (bleep) up.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.014
{\an8}(sobbing)

34:10.081 --> 34:11.382
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

34:11.449 --> 34:12.917
{\an8}You are nobody.

34:11.449 --> 34:12.917
{\an9}Shut up!

34:12.984 --> 34:15.018
{\an8}No, get the (bleep) off me!

34:15.085 --> 34:16.788
{\an8}I'm not!
Get the (bleep) out!

34:15.085 --> 34:16.788
{\an6}Maya!

34:16.853 --> 34:19.190
{\an8}Get him the (bleep) out!
I'm not (bleep) playing!

34:24.027 --> 34:26.164
{\an7}I hope that if my
other exes arrive,
it is not this.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.099
{\an7}Because I'm not
gonna be able to handle it,

34:28.166 --> 34:29.766
{\an7}and I'm really gonna
break down because

34:29.833 --> 34:32.370
{\an7}I'm really, really, really,
really, really, really...

34:32.437 --> 34:34.639
{\an7}(sobbing)

34:36.607 --> 34:39.177
{\an8}(Maya)
There was a rumor going around
about me in college

34:39.243 --> 34:42.313
{\an8}in which I had an incurable STD

34:42.380 --> 34:46.751
{\an8}that was created by
my best friend and my roommate.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.085
{\an8}And it hurt so bad.

34:48.152 --> 34:51.621
{\an8}(sobbing)
This is (bleep) up.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.724
{\an8}(bleep) him.
Dead ass.

34:53.791 --> 34:56.860
{\an8}You know who you
are and you know,

34:56.928 --> 34:59.297
{\an8}we know what you bring
to the table and...

34:59.363 --> 35:01.799
{\an8}He's (bleep) up
for doing that.
And karma's a bitch.

35:01.866 --> 35:03.901
{\an8}I'm just (bleep) over it
and it's, like, I'm trying

35:03.968 --> 35:06.170
{\an8}to be here to grow as a person
and to, like, love again

35:06.237 --> 35:08.706
{\an8}and to be happy and leave this
experience with somebody

35:08.773 --> 35:10.441
{\an8}or without would be open to love

35:10.508 --> 35:12.343
{\an8}and it's, like,
your hardening my heart.

35:12.410 --> 35:15.079
{\an8}(Kareem)
Oh my God.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.548
{\an8}Walking from the kitchen
I literally see

35:17.615 --> 35:21.285
{\an8}Murray, Maya as well
as Diandra talking.

35:21.352 --> 35:23.387
{\an8}And as soon as I seen
that situation, I'm, like,

35:23.454 --> 35:25.256
{\an8}it's about to go down.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.191
{\an8}Are you okay?

35:27.258 --> 35:28.893
{\an8}So Kareem pulls him away.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.429
{\an8}And tells him that I have
an incurable STD.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.998
{\an8}(Murray)
Yeah.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.566
{\an8}Phew.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.702
{\an8}And it's just so (bleep) up
because I'm trying to be nice

35:37.768 --> 35:39.504
{\an8}and it's, like, that's
really what you're doing?

35:39.570 --> 35:41.839
{\an8}(Janelle)
Your mama shoulda
taught you better.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.275
{\an8}We don't do (bleep) like that.

35:44.342 --> 35:45.743
{\an8}That's crossing the line.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.478
{\an8}Actually, you know what?
There's a line.

35:47.545 --> 35:51.415
{\an8}And then there's another line.
He went way past that (bleep)!

35:51.482 --> 35:53.518
{\an8}And you're (bleep) up my makeup,
and he's not even worth that.

35:53.584 --> 35:56.554
{\an8}(Cheyenne)
I'm surprised she's handling
this as well as she has.

35:56.621 --> 36:01.292
{\an8}If I were her, I would've
(bleep) killed this person.

36:01.359 --> 36:05.296
{\an8}Should I say that?
Kill, punch, pushed.

36:05.363 --> 36:06.831
{\an8}(blowing nose)

36:06.898 --> 36:09.500
{\an8}Sorry, I know it's rude.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.402
{\an8}♪♪

36:11.469 --> 36:13.137
{\an8}Oh, boy.

36:13.204 --> 36:16.674
{\an8}She got me up here crying
and (bleep), Didi, like a bitch.

36:16.741 --> 36:19.143
{\an8}I don't know why
she making you cry.
You acting all tough.

36:19.210 --> 36:21.312
{\an7}Yeah, 'cause you know,
okay, okay, when you get hurt.

36:21.379 --> 36:23.080
{\an8}It's like that initial hurt.

36:23.147 --> 36:25.583
{\an7}And then it's, like,
rage, like, you know
what I'm saying?

36:25.650 --> 36:26.918
{\an7}Like, that's just
how it happens.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.853
{\an8}Yeah, but,
how old are you?

36:30.421 --> 36:34.458
{\an8}You're a corny boy that you have
to go over here up in this house

36:34.525 --> 36:37.361
{\an8}and talk about your ex-girl's
vagina, mind you,

36:37.428 --> 36:39.163
{\an8}you guys dated for that long?

36:39.230 --> 36:43.134
{\an8}And now you're just mad because
she's here with my ex?

36:43.200 --> 36:44.602
{\an8}That's wack.

36:44.669 --> 36:46.070
{\an8}Me and Malcolm,
I dated him.

36:46.137 --> 36:48.139
{\an8}I'm not gonna go up here
and disrespect him

36:48.205 --> 36:50.107
{\an8}because there was a point
where I cared about him.

36:50.174 --> 36:51.642
{\an8}I'm not gonna lie
on his name.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.644
{\an8}I'm not gonna go ahead
and spread his business.

36:53.711 --> 36:54.879
{\an8}No, that's maturing.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.347
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up.

36:56.414 --> 36:59.150
{\an7}You get no cool points
for being extra, none at all.

36:59.216 --> 37:02.620
{\an8}I am the wrong chick.

36:59.216 --> 37:02.620
{\an7}Bye, bye.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.589
{\an7}I bet you don't.
I bet you know better.

37:04.655 --> 37:05.790
{\an8}You-- I won't?
I won't?

37:05.856 --> 37:07.358
{\an8}I bet you don't.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.358
{\an8}I won't?

37:07.425 --> 37:09.260
{\an8}(Nicole)
Kareem just probably
wants attention.

37:09.327 --> 37:12.463
{\an8}And the way he is coming off
is just, like, not okay.

37:12.530 --> 37:16.067
{\an8}It's just like a lot of talk
and it's going nowhere.

37:16.133 --> 37:18.803
{\an8}Maya don't want you here.
You should go back in the water.

37:18.869 --> 37:19.971
{\an8}Shut up, bitch!

37:20.037 --> 37:21.339
{\an8}Bitch, what?!
Bitch, what?!

37:21.405 --> 37:23.541
{\an8}Say it, go ahead,
go ahead, bitch, what?

37:23.608 --> 37:26.744
{\an8}Pick your saggy ass up.

37:23.608 --> 37:26.744
{\an8}You're corny.
You're (bleep) corny.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.379
{\an9}Bye.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.379
{\an8}She got me tight, bro.

37:28.446 --> 37:30.581
{\an8}She extra as (bleep), like...

37:30.648 --> 37:33.217
{\an8}So are you, though, hey!

37:30.648 --> 37:33.217
{\an8}No, I'm not.

37:40.825 --> 37:43.494
{\an8}I, like, (bleep) really
need, like, away time.

37:43.561 --> 37:46.263
{\an7}Because, like, I wanna fight.
Like, it's making me angry.

37:46.330 --> 37:49.533
{\an8}(Farrah)
No, you need to not
let that get to you.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.670
{\an8}(announcer)
Congrats, Kareem, you've managed
to turn the entire house

37:52.737 --> 37:55.006
{\an8}against you
in less than 48 hours.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.607
{\an8}Ha, I think that's a record.

37:56.674 --> 38:01.012
{\an8}Kareem is walking but don't
even-- do not entertain it.

38:01.078 --> 38:03.514
{\an8}He wants your energy.
Don't give energy.

38:03.581 --> 38:05.016
{\an8}Do not give...

38:05.082 --> 38:07.151
{\an8}Damn...

38:05.082 --> 38:07.151
{\an7}(Cheyenne)
Sit on the farthest

38:07.218 --> 38:08.586
{\an8}part of that sofa.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.488
{\an8}For your own safety.

38:10.554 --> 38:14.091
{\an8}Kareem needs to go.
He's being a very, very bad boy.

38:14.158 --> 38:16.327
{\an8}You should've just never come.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.963
{\an8}It's all good.
I got my closure.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.899
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up.
'Cause you're trying me.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.701
{\an8}And I will try you like
the bitch you are.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.569
{\an8}So, I'm telling you
shut the (bleep) up.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.804
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up!

38:26.871 --> 38:28.572
{\an8}Go to your room.
Go up to your room.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.341
{\an8}Yeah, okay.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.341
{\an8}Go up to your room!

38:30.408 --> 38:31.876
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up!

38:31.942 --> 38:33.678
{\an7}Away, away from
this show.

38:33.744 --> 38:36.881
{\an8}Farrah's treating Kareem like
he's one of her Goddamn kids.

38:36.947 --> 38:39.250
{\an8}Like, ah, stop, no!

38:39.316 --> 38:41.552
{\an8}Go to bed, like,
go to your room!

38:41.619 --> 38:42.853
{\an9}Shut up!

38:41.619 --> 38:42.853
{\an8}You are nobody.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.822
{\an7}You are nobody away from
this (bleep) show.

38:44.889 --> 38:47.224
{\an8}Why are you here?!

38:44.889 --> 38:47.224
{\an8}You're a nobody.
Nobody.

38:47.291 --> 38:49.160
{\an8}No, get the (bleep)...
off me!

38:49.226 --> 38:50.961
{\an8}I'm not (bleep)
playing with you.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.530
{\an8}(bleep) Maya!

38:52.596 --> 38:54.432
{\an8}Get the (bleep) out!

38:52.596 --> 38:54.432
{\an9}Maya!

38:54.498 --> 38:56.400
{\an8}Get him the (bleep) out!
I'm not (bleep) playing!

39:00.604 --> 39:02.073
{\an8}(announcer)
Welcome back.
After Maya found out

39:02.139 --> 39:05.009
{\an8}Kareem has spread a nasty rumor
that she had an STD,

39:05.076 --> 39:08.879
{\an8}she lost her cool and went
koo-koo for coconuts on him.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.781
{\an8}Get the (bleep) off me!

39:10.848 --> 39:14.185
{\an8}(announcer)
And Farrah pulled a mom and sent
bad boy Kareem to his room

39:14.251 --> 39:15.753
{\an8}for a time out.

39:18.389 --> 39:20.357
{\an8}Get out! Stay out!

39:20.424 --> 39:21.926
{\an8}I'm going back in here, like...

39:21.992 --> 39:24.161
{\an8}I'm not gonna deal with
this (bleep), though, bro.

39:24.228 --> 39:27.465
{\an8}Like evidently I made,
I made mistakes but I'm not
gonna deal with this.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.866
{\an8}Why are you even here?

39:28.933 --> 39:30.634
{\an8}Cheyenne, come
in here and talk.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.136
{\an7}I'm not gonna talk to you, bro.
You (bleep) lied to my face.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.572
{\an7}You (bleep) lied
to my face!

39:32.203 --> 39:34.572
{\an5}How did I lie to you?

39:34.638 --> 39:37.241
{\an7}Yeah, you did and you (bleep)
play her like a fool.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.043
{\an8}There are two things
I don't put up with.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.145
{\an8}Lies and disrespect.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.847
{\an8}Kareem, you done both.

39:42.913 --> 39:46.550
{\an8}You're gonna spread lies about
Maya, I'm gonna confront you

39:46.617 --> 39:47.885
{\an8}'cause that's my home girl.

39:47.952 --> 39:49.253
{\an8}(crosstalk)

39:49.320 --> 39:51.188
{\an8}Shut the door.
Shut the (bleep) door.

39:51.255 --> 39:52.656
{\an8}Shut the door.
Shut the door.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.225
{\an8}They can see whatever
the (bleep) they want.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.393
{\an8}I told Murray...

39:54.291 --> 39:56.393
{\an7}Bro, you told Murray
not to tell me.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.229
{\an8}No, that's not
how it went.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.229
{\an8}Oh, really?

39:58.295 --> 40:00.297
{\an7}Now you're gonna
play me too?

40:00.364 --> 40:02.566
{\an8}My exact words
to Murray was...

40:02.633 --> 40:05.002
{\an7}Your a (bleep)
lying-ass (bleep).

40:02.633 --> 40:05.002
{\an9}So be it.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.905
{\an8}So be it,
so what happens now?

40:05.069 --> 40:07.905
{\an5}So you got your closure!

40:07.972 --> 40:10.074
{\an7}So get the (bleep) out.
Get the (bleep) out.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.675
{\an8}But you're not giving me...

40:11.742 --> 40:13.144
{\an7}I'll knock your
(bleep) block off!

40:13.210 --> 40:16.080
{\an7}Get the (bleep) out!
Get the (bleep)
out of my face!

40:16.147 --> 40:18.749
{\an8}(Murray)
I'm pretty much just hiding away
and letting the fight happen.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.451
{\an8}And, I'm, like,
should I go help Cheyenne?

40:20.518 --> 40:22.019
{\an8}Because Cheyenne's
not that big of a guy.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.256
{\an8}But the last thing I want
is somebody coming for me.

40:25.322 --> 40:28.259
{\an8}(angry crosstalk)

40:28.325 --> 40:30.427
{\an8}Like you think
I'm some bitch?

40:30.494 --> 40:33.731
{\an8}I will (bleep) you up!

40:30.494 --> 40:33.731
{\an9}That's it.

40:33.798 --> 40:36.467
{\an8}You don't even know!
You don't know this.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.102
{\an8}(angry shouting)

40:38.169 --> 40:40.171
{\an8}Get out!

40:40.237 --> 40:42.006
{\an8}That is it.

40:42.072 --> 40:43.240
{\an8}(bleep) God!

40:43.307 --> 40:44.942
{\an8}Everybody's losing
their (bleep).

40:45.009 --> 40:48.612
{\an8}And, honestly, I'm just, like,
what the hell am I doing here?

40:48.679 --> 40:50.581
{\an8}The whole point
is to, like, date.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.249
{\an8}Can't we just drink and bang?

40:52.316 --> 40:55.619
{\an8}Are you the bitch ass (bleep)
bitch mate (bleep)?

40:55.686 --> 40:56.954
{\an8}You only relevant
'cause of me.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.190
{\an8}You know better.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.190
{\an8}So enjoy your 15 minutes.

40:59.256 --> 41:00.291
{\an8}You was my (bleep).

41:00.357 --> 41:01.992
{\an8}I was your (bleep) bitch?!

41:02.059 --> 41:04.361
{\an8}Get the (bleep) out!

41:05.529 --> 41:06.764
{\an7}You only relevant
'cause of me.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.366
{\an7}Get the (bleep) out!
You (bleep)!

41:09.433 --> 41:10.701
{\an8}Get the (bleep) out!

41:10.768 --> 41:13.971
{\an8}(bleeps)

41:14.038 --> 41:15.172
{\an8}Oh, man!

41:15.239 --> 41:18.008
{\an8}(bleep) you, and I mean it!
