[clicking]

00:28.080 --> 00:29.920
[suspenseful music playing]

00:35.480 --> 00:36.800
Can we fix this?

00:38.760 --> 00:39.680
We have to.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.000
[suspenseful music builds]

01:04.760 --> 01:06.480
Imagine you had a secret.

01:07.280 --> 01:11.200
Something that you wanted to keep safe,
but your enemies were desperate to know.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.880
So, how would you stay
one step ahead of them?

01:13.960 --> 01:15.440
You see, every single day,

01:15.520 --> 01:18.960
every person at MI6
works secretly around the world

01:19.040 --> 01:21.200
to keep the UK safer and stronger,

01:21.280 --> 01:23.680
so that we're one step ahead
of our adversaries.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.160
Does anyone here know
what the head of MI6 is called?

01:27.240 --> 01:29.000
-Oh wow! Okay, yep?
-M?

01:29.080 --> 01:30.600
-[mimics game show buzzer]
-[laughter]

01:30.680 --> 01:32.200
[chuckles] No. It's a good guess.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.480
It's actually not M.
That's just in the movies. It's C.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.160
Does anyone know what C stands for?

01:40.240 --> 01:42.640
-Anyone other than Callum?
-[laughter]

01:42.720 --> 01:44.240
No? [laughs]

01:44.320 --> 01:45.640
-Go on, bud.
-Control.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.840
Control. Control is right.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.720
So, Control is in charge of
every single agent at MI6, including me.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.440
I'm his deputy, but he runs the show.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.680
[distant siren wailing]

01:56.760 --> 01:58.720
[ominous music playing]

02:05.200 --> 02:06.200
He's landed.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.960
[woman] Number 10 called, sir.
The PM is asking for a brief chat.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.360
He wants to reassure you
that it's business as usual

02:12.440 --> 02:14.200
until a successor has been elected.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.960
-I'll set something for this afternoon.
-Thank you, Zoe.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.880
-Your coat, Sir Martin.
-Morning.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.480
Nigel. How are you?

02:29.120 --> 02:32.280
A little surprised to get your call.
How are things? How's Mary?

02:32.360 --> 02:33.960
Fine. Shall we sit?

03:02.200 --> 03:03.520
-[bleep]
-[lock clicks]

03:08.840 --> 03:11.840
[man in car] Two PPOs.
One in the vehicle. One in the club.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.800
[bleep]

03:16.520 --> 03:18.320
[man] Ready. Service!

03:19.040 --> 03:20.000
[woman] Yes, chef.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.520
[man 2] Hang on…

03:50.320 --> 03:52.360
President of the Supreme Court

03:52.440 --> 03:55.880
illegally obtains a visa
for his 26-year-old lover.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.280
Tabloids will eat it up.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
Nigel.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.120
I can make this go away.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.520
How?

04:11.360 --> 04:13.840
Won't be entered
into any official records.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.240
I'll make sure it never comes
to the attention of the police or MI5.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.840
And I won't ask for anything in return.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.200
Not immediately, anyway.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.760
[server] What can I get
for you gentlemen?

04:27.840 --> 04:30.320
Uh, the tuna niçoise
and a glass of the usual.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.320
Thank you, Alice.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.360
-Anything for you, sir?
-Uh, nothing for me, thanks. I'm going.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.680
Think about what I said.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.800
Let me know what you decide.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.040
[ominous music playing]

05:17.560 --> 05:18.920
Your whiskey and water, sir.

05:19.880 --> 05:20.920
Thank you.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.120
Uh, wait.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.480
You can take the tray.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.120
[gasps]

06:14.920 --> 06:16.360
[engine starts]

06:16.440 --> 06:17.400
[woman] Let's go.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.040
[muffled] Here we are, sir.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.440
Sir Martin, are-- are you okay?

06:42.680 --> 06:43.680
Sir Martin?

06:45.400 --> 06:46.800
We made it, Kara.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.520
-[loud crash]
-[cyclist grunting]

06:50.600 --> 06:51.800

-Shit!

06:53.640 --> 06:55.120
Hey! Hey, what are you--

06:57.560 --> 06:59.120
[revs engine]

06:59.200 --> 07:00.400
[tires squeal]

07:04.360 --> 07:06.680
We have to go. Come on!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.040
Where is he?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.320
What happened? Back up! Back up!

07:20.840 --> 07:21.960
Call an ambulance!

07:23.520 --> 07:24.920
-Uh… Teddy.
-[burst of radio chatter]

07:25.000 --> 07:28.040
Do you have a number? Like 007?

07:28.120 --> 07:30.320
Uh, good question.
So, we don't have…

07:30.400 --> 07:32.280
-Uh, one second.
-[whispering]

07:34.800 --> 07:36.800
[pensive music playing]

07:43.400 --> 07:44.240
Right. Um…

07:46.080 --> 07:48.400
I think I'm gonna have
to leave it there, guys.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.680
Thank you for having me.
Enjoy the rest of your day.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.080
-[teacher] Say thank you to Mr. Lawrence.
-Dad?

07:53.160 --> 07:55.920
-Hey. I'll see you back at home. Yeah?
-[teacher] Very kind of him…

07:58.560 --> 07:59.840
We're coming out now.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.080
-How long ago?
-Eight minutes ago, sir.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.320
-Where?
-At his club, having lunch.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.000
-How is he?
-It's touch and go, sir.

08:06.080 --> 08:06.920
His heart stopped.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.360
They had to resuscitate him
before the ambulance arrived.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.240
Can you get the chief of staff
on the phone?

08:11.320 --> 08:13.000
I need to brief the foreign secretary.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.800
Call HQ. I want a special operations room
up and running by the time I get back.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.800
Let's throw a two-mile perimeter
around the scene. CCTV, traffic cameras.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.120
-We'll need everything.
-I'll give 'em a heads-up.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.240
Olamide, sir.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.640
Olamide, is this a threat
to national security? Are we under attack?

08:28.720 --> 08:31.120
We don't know yet.
We're pulling everybody in.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.720
I'm going to connect you
to the foreign secretary now.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.760
[sirens blaring]

08:37.080 --> 08:39.480
Minister, it's the deputy chief of MI6.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.520
Not a congratulations call
I was expecting.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.600
-I'll be honest.
-Uh, Minister?

08:44.680 --> 08:47.440
The leadership.
Sorry, isn't that why you're calling?

08:47.520 --> 08:50.560
Uh, Sir Martin Angelis
was admitted to Bart's ten minutes ago.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.080
He suffered a cardiac arrest
while he was dining in his club.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.400
He is unconscious.
He's being kept in isolation.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.320
Isolation?

08:57.400 --> 09:00.160
It's a precaution.
We think he may have been poisoned.

09:00.680 --> 09:01.760
Oh God.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.440
[sighs] Are you ready
to assume his duties as chief?

09:05.960 --> 09:06.960
Yes, ma'am.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.960
-Ever met the PM?
-Once.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.360
As soon as you've been briefed by the
police, you'll bring us both up to speed.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.800
Understood.
Another attack may be imminent.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.080
If an attempt was made to kill the chief
of MI6, we need to raise the threat level.

09:18.160 --> 09:21.240
You're gonna have some big calls to make.
Can you handle it?

09:21.320 --> 09:23.320
[distant siren wailing]

09:24.040 --> 09:24.920
Yes, ma'am.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.440
[suspenseful music playing]

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
[vibrating]

10:03.120 --> 10:04.840
Oh, this feels a lot better, Danny.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.880
I can tell
you've been doing your exercises.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.160
Well, I've been trying. [grunts]

10:10.040 --> 10:12.520
You know, I served
with the Royal Welsh in Afghanistan.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.240
-Oh, yeah?
-You served, right?

10:14.760 --> 10:17.480
-Who told you that?
-Oh, one of the nurses.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.440
Hmm.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, I was a captain
with the 47th Royal Artillery.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.400
Well, you're a damn sight better looking
than my CO was. [chuckles]

10:26.040 --> 10:28.560
I'm meaner too.
Now shift over to the other side for me.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.680
Yes, ma'am.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.920
[woman] Fingers on the pads, please, sir.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.160
[Olamide] Your heartbeat is
the most secure biometric.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.560
An individual's ECG signals
can't be faked.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.400
This will give
the highest level of security clearance.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.080
I've scheduled a call
with the secretary general of NATO

10:45.160 --> 10:46.640
and the CIA director.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.080
There'll be others,
but we should start there.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.960
All done.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.520
[Olamide] Zoe will be
your executive assistant.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.520
As chief of staff,

10:57.600 --> 11:00.680
I keep the day-to-day decisions
off Sir Martin's desk.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.440
-I'll do the same for you.
-Great. Well, don't go easy on me.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.360
We must maintain the appearance of
business as usual. Mustn't miss a step.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.600
[phone vibrates]

11:08.680 --> 11:10.880
I'm going to take this.
Can I, uh… use Sir Martin's?

11:11.480 --> 11:13.920
That's your office now, C.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.200
Ah, right.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.160
-The PM's calling in three minutes.
-Thanks, Zoe.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.000
-Mads?
-Hey, babe.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.000
Everything okay?
Sorry, I was with a patient.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.280
Yeah, sort of.
I didn't wanna leave a voice mail.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.960
All right, Mr. Mysterious.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.520
-Are you definitely alone?
-Yeah, what's going on?

11:34.240 --> 11:37.200
Someone tried to kill Martin Angelis
less than an hour ago.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.240
-He's in pretty bad shape.
-Are you okay?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.240
I've been, uh, stepped up to chief.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.280
[sighing] Oh God. Of course.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.680
I know. I need to get up to speed.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.560
But I'm gonna make sure
I'm home in time to put the kids to bed.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.440
I-- I wanna be there
to explain it to them.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.960
I was at the school when I found out,
so Callum knows something's up.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.840
[laughs] Nothing gets past him, eh?

11:58.560 --> 12:00.600
But I think, um,
Ella might struggle with this.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.280
Yeah, just a bit.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.280
Listen, things are gonna change
for all of us.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.760
Sorry this has to be over the phone.
I… I wish we were together.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.160
Yeah, me too. But we will be.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.160
Just do what you've gotta do, okay?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.120
We'll be okay.

12:16.760 --> 12:21.120
[sighs] Christ, I must have been
in this office a thousand times, just…

12:22.160 --> 12:23.920
never this side of the desk.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.800
Adam, you've got this.

12:25.880 --> 12:26.920
You've got it.

12:28.000 --> 12:28.840
I love you.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.520
I love you too, sweetie. Bye.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.400
[tender music playing]

12:40.440 --> 12:41.360
[phone rings]

12:41.440 --> 12:44.360
-The PM is on line one.
-Thank you, Zoe, put him through.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.680
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.280
The PM's raised the threat level
to severe.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.160
He wants hourly updates. What have we got?

12:58.240 --> 13:00.560
We have a description
of the woman who served Sir Martin.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.040
It wasn't one of the regular staff.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.240
We're looking for a Caucasian,
dark shoulder-length hair, slim face.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.040
-CCTV?
-In the office, not the public spaces.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.000
Sir Martin was one of the members
who voted against installing it.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.520
Well, that's wonderful.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.480
-So, what's the chain of command?
-I'm in charge.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.480
Is there a decision
to appoint a permanent successor?

13:20.560 --> 13:22.280
Jesus, Malik, he's not dead just yet.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.480
[Adam] He'll be back. But we need to know
if Angelis was the ultimate target

13:25.560 --> 13:27.440
or if this is part of a wider threat.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.400
So, who puts together a hit like this?

13:30.640 --> 13:32.120
The Russians wrote the playbook on it.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.520
Yeah, but they like an end goal,
something tangible.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.160
A move like this is a big deal,

13:36.240 --> 13:39.880
particularly with the way things are
at the moment, so, no, I don't see it.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.960
So let's push our assets in Tehran,
Baghdad, Damascus, Moscow.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.880
Let me know anything.
The slightest whisper.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.280
-Yes, C.
-Right. That's all for now. Let's go.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.920
Remember that crazy bastard
in training? Fort Monckton?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.360
Used to get us to run up and down
and whip tennis balls at us.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.880
[laughs] Yeah.
Said if we ever took enemy fire,

14:04.960 --> 14:07.120
we'd remember to run in zigzags,
not a straight line.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.480
Yeah. "Make yourself
the hardest possible target, boys."

14:12.040 --> 14:15.320
Angelis is unlikely to survive,
let alone come back from this, so…

14:16.160 --> 14:17.840
the big job is yours.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.960
But if there is something else coming,
you've gotta stand and face it.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.000
Zigzagging won't work here.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.080
Stay here. Wait for my call.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.840
What if we killed the rider?

14:39.400 --> 14:40.440
We?

14:41.640 --> 14:44.320
Look. I needed a driver,
you didn't hesitate.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.520
No, but that means something to me,
Thomas.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.080
-[sighs]
-It does.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.400
Hey, look at me.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.320
I'll take care of you.
Give me a few hours. I'll get your money.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.320
I'm gonna get changed.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.840
[Adam] Use the description of the suspect,

15:11.920 --> 15:14.320
but until we know what we're dealing with,
keep a lid on it.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.000
I want a total media blackout.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.560
All right. That's all. Thank you.

15:27.080 --> 15:27.920
[phone rings]

15:29.720 --> 15:30.560
Becky.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.760
There was a hit-and-run on a delivery
rider half a mile from the club.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.480
It's Central London,
so it might just be coincidence,

15:36.560 --> 15:39.480
but it happened within a few minutes
of the attack on Sir Martin.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.600
-Did the rider see who was driving?
-Only that it was a male.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.840
But he remembered enough of the license
plate for us to find the owner.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.240
He sold it for cash two weeks ago
to one Charles McGregor.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.440
Not his real name.
But we have a decent description now.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.360
-Might be nothing, but it's all we have.
-Okay.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.480
Get the description out.
Chase it down. We might get lucky.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.560
[pensive music playing]

16:15.320 --> 16:16.760
Oh fuck.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.280
-Have a good evening, sir.
-Thanks.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.360
[drops bag]

17:05.720 --> 17:07.040
[Callum] Dad! Dad.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.080
Come here.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.800
[radio chatter]

17:22.000 --> 17:23.200
Is it dangerous?

17:23.720 --> 17:25.000
[Maddy] What, sweetheart?

17:25.520 --> 17:28.080
Dad's new job. Will we be safe?

17:28.160 --> 17:31.840
Yeah. And we'll have people
guarding the house.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.720
-Did they give you a bigger office?
-[Adam chuckles] Yeah, they did, actually.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.760
And it's got armored glass
and its own ventilation system.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.680
Whoa.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.560
What about school?

17:46.320 --> 17:49.520
A protection officer, Frank Scott,
will pick you up and drop you off.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.480
-And do you know him? Quite well?
-Yeah, I've known him for years.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.400
He's got his own children,
and he's… he's a good man.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.840
And he's armed, right?

17:58.920 --> 18:00.200
And he's armed.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.680
-Cool.
-No, it's not cool, Cal.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.320
Dad has to do this. Right, Dad?

18:07.400 --> 18:09.600
Well, it is my job, sweetheart.

18:10.120 --> 18:13.480
And when you saved all those people
in the embassy, that was your job too?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.160
Well… yeah, but that was fieldwork,

18:15.240 --> 18:17.360
which is way more dangerous
than what I do now.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.640
Will we still do movie night?

18:21.680 --> 18:23.240
[chuckles] Yeah, of course.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.640
Then I reckon it's cool.
No matter what Ella says.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.240
Hey.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.720
You didn't pick up the phone.
I started to get worried.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.320
Thought something had gone wrong.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.400
Well, I had to be careful.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.560
They took the cyclist you hit to hospital.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.720
Oh. He's all right? That's good.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.120
No, it's not.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.360
Your face is on the Met server, Thomas.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.560
Every cop in this city has it.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.320
It's half of what I owe you.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.120
I'll get you the rest once I've figured
somewhere safe for you, okay?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.320
-Are you coming too?
-Of course.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.400
Now put your cash away.
There's some bad people around.

19:22.840 --> 19:26.840
I've been checking the news.
Haven't seen anything about Angelis.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.640
Head of MI6 dying.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.800
Mm. I thought it'd be everywhere.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.400
I didn't want him dead.
Just out of the way.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.760
Hmm.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.200
[chokes]

19:48.040 --> 19:49.400
[gasps]

19:49.480 --> 19:50.320
[sighs]

19:53.800 --> 19:55.320
[gasping for breath]

19:55.400 --> 19:56.840
I don't fuck up, Keegan.

19:56.920 --> 19:57.880
[gasps]

19:57.960 --> 19:59.240
[glass smashes]

19:59.320 --> 20:00.920
[clattering]

20:01.880 --> 20:03.400
[choking breaths]

20:03.480 --> 20:04.760
I leave that to you.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.600
[wheezing]

20:11.200 --> 20:12.080
Babe.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.280
I just don't want an armed escort.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.960
Well, we can talk to them.
Try and keep things as normal as possible.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.720
That's why you have a deputy.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.120
In case something happens
to the person in charge.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.480
So your dad really has to step up now.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.120
I just found my group at school.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.200
And Emma and her lot
have only just stopped picking on me.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.720
I just don't want things to change.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.360
Yeah.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.680
What did you expect?
No 14-year-old girl wants to stand out.

20:52.760 --> 20:56.000
Sure. No, I know. I'm just not sure
what I'm supposed to do about it.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.960
Nothing. [sighs]

20:59.040 --> 21:01.800
She just needs time.
We all need a bit of time.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.840
I don't know if I'm ready.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.040
Your whole career
has been building up to this.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.000
He wouldn't have
made you deputy otherwise.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.440
Oh, um… slightly awkward,

21:18.520 --> 21:23.040
but I will need you to call me C,
or Chief, if you prefer.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.320
[laughs] In front of the PPOs,
you know, to maintain authority.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.560
-I think it's important.
-Mmm.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.680
-[chuckles]
-It depends.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.240
-Will you still be taking the bins out?
-Mmm, yeah.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.240
I mean, I'll need an armed escort,
but sure, that's okay.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.640
Well, in that case…

21:39.680 --> 21:41.080
-Chief.
-[both chuckle]

21:51.480 --> 21:53.240
[phone vibrating]

21:53.320 --> 21:54.280
[Adam groans]

21:57.320 --> 21:58.320
Sorry.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.600
-Come on!
-No, I have to-- I have to take it!

22:01.680 --> 22:03.120
-[groans]
-Just give me a second.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.240
-Yeah.
-[Malik] C, we found the body.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.640
Haven't touched it.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.040
Where?

22:13.880 --> 22:16.040
-Who is he?
-Thomas Keegan.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.440
Thirty-six years old, two convictions.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.080
One for armed robbery.
One for possession of firearms.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.040
We'll know more after the postmortem,

22:23.120 --> 22:27.160
but the medical examiner is fairly certain
the cause of death was poisoning.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.320
What are the odds that
it's the same poison Sir Martin was given?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.000
Only this time, the dose was fatal.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.040
Yeah, someone's covering their tracks.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.360
Sir Martin's conscious.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.440
[monitors bleeping]

22:39.080 --> 22:40.760
I heard it was a woman.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.560
Mm.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.760
She could have killed me if she wanted to.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.920
Why didn't she?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.880
Because it's not personal.
It's part of something bigger.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.400
Good.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.400
[sighs]

22:59.280 --> 23:02.360
Now, this is the worst possible time.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.840
The leadership election.

23:04.920 --> 23:09.280
Very volatile. Do not trust anyone.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.080
Not the police, not even your own people.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.400
Some of them will doubt
that you can do this.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.720
A young father. Not enough experience.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.560
No killer instinct.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.360
But I know what you're capable of.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.520
You have my full confidence.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.600
Thank you, sir.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.200
[sighs] Are you ready?

23:36.600 --> 23:40.640
Because my enemies are your enemies now.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.520
Can you handle them?

23:45.480 --> 23:46.480
Yes, sir.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.560
When you have something, come back to me.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.280
I'll need to be up to speed
when I get out of here.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.600
Get some rest, sir.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.200
And thanks for the books.

23:59.760 --> 24:05.400
They're a bit, uh… esoteric,
but I appreciate the thought.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.880
Uh--

24:14.800 --> 24:15.920
Uh…

24:17.400 --> 24:19.040
You, uh… you're welcome, sir.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.120
[camera clicks]

24:24.200 --> 24:26.200
[pensive music playing]

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
[ominous music playing]

25:56.800 --> 25:58.120
Books were a nice touch.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.480
Old school. Dostoevsky.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.560
Your favorite Russian author.

26:04.280 --> 26:08.320
And Ali and Nino.
A love story set in Baku.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.200
I kept it simple.

26:12.480 --> 26:15.560
I know how fat and rusty people get
behind a desk.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.760
[both laugh]

26:19.560 --> 26:22.080
It's not appropriate for us
to meet like this, Kara.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.000
And yet, here you are.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.880
Well, the books are in his hospital room.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.960
I presume you have intel
on who tried to kill him.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.040
Besides, it's been a while.
I was intrigued.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.240
But I am still MI6, and you are SVR.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.200
They threw me out.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.640
Oh.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.280
Why?

26:44.720 --> 26:47.600
For tipping you off
about the embassy siege?

26:48.120 --> 26:49.680
[siren wailing]

26:49.760 --> 26:51.120
What is this, Kara?

26:53.360 --> 26:54.720
I've come to collect.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.120
You have no idea of the things I've done

27:00.200 --> 27:02.960
to get you a heartbeat away
from the top job.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.480
Just so that you'd finally be
in the position to help me.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.000
You poisoned Angelis?

27:16.160 --> 27:20.520
With your shiny new security clearance,
you're gonna help me get what I need.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.760
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll call my team,

27:22.840 --> 27:24.360
and then I'll have you arrested.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.600
I don't think so.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.960
How are you gonna explain to Maddy
that your entire career

27:29.040 --> 27:31.080
has been engineered by your ex-lover?

27:31.920 --> 27:33.160
What are you talking about?

27:33.240 --> 27:37.200
The tanker you boarded in the Caspian Sea
carrying three stolen M270s?

27:38.400 --> 27:41.440
The intel came
from a source at the docks, right?

27:42.320 --> 27:46.280
Wrong. It was me.
Your mole inside Turkish Special Forces?

27:46.360 --> 27:47.320
Me.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.440
The briefcase carrying
chemical supply intel

27:50.520 --> 27:53.200
that just mysteriously landed in your lap?

27:53.960 --> 27:54.920
You're welcome, Adam.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.080
Every intel win you earned,
I gift wrapped for you.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.040
Adam, you'd be nothing without me.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.240
I don't need you to do my job,

28:04.320 --> 28:06.680
so stay the fuck away
from me and my family.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.440
You don't even know what it is I want.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.560
-I don't need to know. We're done here.
-No we're not.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.720
We're just getting started, Adam.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.280
[sighs]

28:16.880 --> 28:17.720
Fuck.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.520
[tires squealing]

28:35.280 --> 28:37.000
[doors slamming]

28:39.560 --> 28:41.240
I hope you got some rest on the flight.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.960
The CIA doesn't normally spring
for business class.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.200
All right, our cover,
a civil engineering firm.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.400
Our target…

28:49.240 --> 28:53.240
The recently promoted chief of MI6,
Adam Lawrence.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.080
Check your emails
for a full security briefing.

28:56.160 --> 28:59.160
-[engine starts]
-I want us up and running in three hours.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.840
I need to make a house call. Let's go!

29:18.280 --> 29:19.560
-Hey.
-Dede?

29:19.640 --> 29:21.720
They said I could come back.
I hope that's all right.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.160
Of course! Oh my God!

29:24.680 --> 29:26.360
What the fuck are you doing in town?

29:26.440 --> 29:28.440
[pop song playing]

29:29.680 --> 29:30.520
[Maddy gasps]

29:30.600 --> 29:33.240
-Oh, look at us!
-Yeah.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.920
God, I don't even remember this
being taken.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.320
Second tour, your first week
as military liaison with my guys.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.240
[Maddy] Oh, yeah.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.440
-Oh, look at us. We look so innocent.
-[laughs]

29:46.520 --> 29:47.440
Don't we?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.280
So, what is this?

29:51.800 --> 29:54.080
I thought you were at Langley,
living in a cubicle,

29:54.160 --> 29:56.000
plotting to take over the CIA.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.760
And who says I'm not?

29:57.840 --> 29:59.040
[both laugh]

30:00.200 --> 30:02.920
Actually, um…
I'm between operations right now.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.000
-I needed a break.
-Mm.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.200
Um… You know what,
to tell you the truth,

30:08.280 --> 30:11.680
I took a look around,
and I realized it had been far too long

30:11.760 --> 30:14.080
since I'd seen the people
I really care about.

30:16.000 --> 30:16.920
Pathetic.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.600
[both laugh]

30:19.600 --> 30:20.680
It is so good to see you.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.640
So, how's the whole stepmom thing
workin' out for you?

30:24.720 --> 30:26.880
-Okay, I take it back.
-I'm kidding. Really.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.880
It suits you. You look good.
So, how are the kids?

30:31.480 --> 30:33.600
I love them. They're great.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.880
The four of us are tight.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.360
I mean, things are trickier now, but…

30:38.440 --> 30:39.480
How do you mean?

30:41.080 --> 30:42.400
Uh… [sighs]

30:42.480 --> 30:44.320
It's just Adam's work.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.080
It's all very confidential.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.440
Sure, sure.

30:48.040 --> 30:48.920
Sure.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.240
-I mean, I would tell you if I could.
-Please don't.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.360
My whole fucking life is confidential.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.920
I'm just here on vacation to see my friend

30:58.000 --> 31:02.240
and maybe,
if you can, uh… get a babysitter,

31:02.320 --> 31:03.840
have a night out on the town?

31:03.920 --> 31:07.200
Do you remember that shady bar
at Camp Russell?

31:07.800 --> 31:09.200
-Oh my God.
-Yeah?

31:09.280 --> 31:10.560
[both laugh]

31:14.280 --> 31:16.160
-I mean…
-Tequila.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.040
[both laughing]

31:28.320 --> 31:29.240
All right.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.560
We haven't got enough tickets.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.600
The PPOs aren't watching it, bud.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.480
This is stupid.

31:37.400 --> 31:41.560
Oh, Ella. It's all right, sweetie.
We'll get used to it, okay?

31:41.640 --> 31:44.120
-Remember, we're the Four Musketeers.
-Dad.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.040
-It's all clear, sir.
-Thanks, Frank.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.080
-Mum?
-Hmm?

31:47.160 --> 31:49.080
-Can we get some popcorn?
-Yeah.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.680
-Not for Els. She hates it.
-[scoffs]

31:54.320 --> 31:55.280
What's going on?

31:55.800 --> 31:57.920
-Sorry, nothing, I'm just, uh…
-Adam?

31:58.000 --> 32:01.520
No, I'm all right. Sorry, just work stuff.
Tell me about your day.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.400
-[phone vibrates]
-Well, um…

32:03.480 --> 32:06.000
Hold on a sec. Oh, this might be the PM.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.600
I should take it.
I'll see-- I'll see you in there.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.400
Adam Lawrence.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.600
[Kara] I thought you were going
to have me arrested.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.960
I thought
you'd have left the country by now.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.320
The IDR is gonna detonate
an explosive device

32:21.400 --> 32:23.960
on a cross-Channel ferry
when it docks tomorrow.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.320
-How do you know that?
-Because I'm good.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.120
You still sure
you can do your job without me?

32:30.840 --> 32:33.000
I can give you the intel
to stop the attack.

32:34.600 --> 32:38.360
All I want in exchange are
the MI6 files on Baku.

32:38.440 --> 32:39.760
On Baku?

32:39.840 --> 32:42.400
Yeah. Five local men were killed.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.960
And I need to know what happened.
That's it. It's not much to ask.

32:46.640 --> 32:50.240
There are hundreds of people
on that ferry, Adam. You can save them.

32:51.640 --> 32:52.520
What do you say?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.080
Quid pro quo?

32:55.320 --> 32:56.200
Yeah, give it to me.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.880
16 Dean Street.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.480
There is an item for you,
but it closes at ten.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.400
No, um, I'm with my family. Kara, no--

33:03.480 --> 33:04.760
Ask for Magomayev.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.080
[pensive music playing]

33:22.280 --> 33:24.200
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, it's nothing.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.920
Oh, uh, listen,
I, uh… ordered a present for Olamide.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
It's his birthday, but I forgot
to send a courier to pick it up, so…

33:33.600 --> 33:36.000
When we're done here,
we'll just swing by. It's not far.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.080
Sure.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.120
[ominous music playing]

33:47.200 --> 33:48.120
[sighs]

33:49.240 --> 33:51.040
Is that it? Great, thank you.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.800
What's taking him so long?

34:13.040 --> 34:14.320
I'm sorry. I'm coming.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.080
Tina, we have intel there's a device
on a ferry entering Dover tomorrow.

34:30.160 --> 34:33.120
Can you get counterterrorism patched in?
I'm gonna give you an IMO number.

34:33.200 --> 34:34.200
One sec.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.240
Yeah, that's 88274599.

34:41.720 --> 34:43.160
Great. Bye.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.440
[clears throat]

34:44.520 --> 34:45.840
-Sorry, guys.
-[radio chatter]

34:45.920 --> 34:47.120
-All right, let's go.
-Dad. Dad!

34:48.440 --> 34:50.120
[engine starts]

34:50.960 --> 34:52.880
[clock ticking]

34:53.480 --> 34:55.080
[dog barking in distance]

35:02.320 --> 35:03.280
Hey.

35:05.920 --> 35:06.800
You awake?

35:29.160 --> 35:30.880
[heartbeat]

35:33.040 --> 35:34.480
[bleeping]

36:04.960 --> 36:07.360
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
[clears throat]

36:13.840 --> 36:15.680
-You okay?
-Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.800
You can talk to me, you know.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.080
It helps me, too,
to know we're on the same page.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.480
[sighs] Yeah.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.520
I just need to get some rest.

36:29.880 --> 36:30.960
[sighs]

36:32.960 --> 36:34.240
[sighs deeply]

36:45.640 --> 36:46.760
[vibrating]

36:47.320 --> 36:48.440
Adam?

36:48.520 --> 36:51.720
I took a look at what we discussed.
MI6 weren't involved.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.200
I wanna know who killed my men.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.640
No. There's nothing there.
No name, no officer, nothing.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.320
Then you need to try harder, Adam.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.640
I'm afraid not. If there's nothing there,
the information doesn't exist.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.040
There's nothing else I can do.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.040
I don't wanna hear from you again.
We're done.

37:21.800 --> 37:26.720
Okay, so he bought this present
for a coworker.

37:26.800 --> 37:27.760
An LP.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.640
At ten o'clock at night.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.200
It was off. It was off.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.400
How do you mean?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.880
I don't know. It felt like a--
It felt like a dead drop.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.040
Does it work like that? There's no one
else I can talk to about these things.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.040
Did you ask him about it? I mean…

37:47.000 --> 37:48.480
What was the LP?

37:48.560 --> 37:51.480
[sighs] It's this folk singer from Baku.
I don't know.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.400
Adam's first posting was there.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.080
[groans] I feel awful. I just…

37:57.680 --> 38:01.880
It must be really hard for him, you know,
this-- this new job and all the pressure…

38:02.640 --> 38:04.840
I just-- I wanna support him. I wanna…

38:06.720 --> 38:09.440
But there's something going on.
I just can't put my finger on it.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.080
Um… One second.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.080
I don't know if I brought it with me.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.280
Ah.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.040
Here.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.560
-What-- what--
-It's pretty old-school, low-tech.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.600
Click it once, and it records speech
within a ten-meter range.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.000
It'll put your mind at rest.

38:29.080 --> 38:32.360
Because you're going to find
that it's nothing. I guarantee it.

38:35.960 --> 38:37.920
Might we discuss
the counterterrorism agents

38:38.000 --> 38:42.160
that stormed a ferry inbound to Dover,
dressed as a maintenance crew?

38:42.240 --> 38:45.040
They took out two members
of a Dutch far-right group.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.160
One of them had a nail bomb in a backpack.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.440
Well done us.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.560
-[laughs]
-I had no warning from my networks.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.240
I hear you reached out
to the counterterrorism squad

38:53.320 --> 38:55.320
with an IMO number, sir, late last night.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.880
We avoided multiple casualties--

38:56.960 --> 39:00.320
The European far-right falls under
my purview. I should've been informed.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.720
We didn't have time,
and it's not how I do things.

39:06.640 --> 39:07.800
Should get used to that.

39:25.720 --> 39:28.800
The police returned
Sir Martin's briefcase, sir.

39:32.320 --> 39:36.040
You need to remove any confidential files
before I send it to his home.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.320
And Patrick's outside
if you have a second.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.680
Uh, yeah, send him in.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.960
Did I detect a bit of dick swinging
back there with Malik?

40:01.040 --> 40:02.560
Get in here. Can you shut the door?

40:03.520 --> 40:04.440
Yep.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.080
The President of the Supreme Court?
What is this?

40:13.520 --> 40:17.320
It was in the old man's briefcase.
Have you ever seen a file like this?

40:17.400 --> 40:18.240
-[knocking]
-No.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.680
Sir. Ella's protection officer went
to pick her up after school,

40:22.760 --> 40:24.760
but she left by a different exit.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.400
We don't have eyes on her.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.920
[music playing trough earphones]

40:46.920 --> 40:48.080
[bleep]

40:50.480 --> 40:51.320
[sighs]

41:06.480 --> 41:09.440
We should be able to track her phone
in the next two minutes.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.880
What the hell is she thinking?

41:10.960 --> 41:12.880
-She's a teenager asserting herself.
-[sighs]

41:12.960 --> 41:15.120
-She'll be… heading straight home.
-[phone vibrates]

41:15.200 --> 41:17.160
Here she is. Ella!

41:17.760 --> 41:19.640
Dad. Someone's following me.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.680
-[static crackles]
-It's a woman. I'm freaking out.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.920
-Where are you, sweetheart?
-The canal near school.

41:24.520 --> 41:27.040
She's by the canal. Okay, wh-- which side?

41:27.120 --> 41:29.600
[breaking up] I don't know.
I'm scared, Dad.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.920
No… no, it's okay, sweetheart.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.800
I'm right here, but you're cutting out.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.200
-Stay calm.
-I'm so sorry.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.160
Go back to the road, find a shop.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.480
-[breaking up] Just ask someone to help.
-[call drops]

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
Ella?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.080
[mutters] God.
Get a team out there immediately.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.200
-Throw a net over the entire area.
-I'm on it, sir.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.120
[sighs]

41:47.200 --> 41:48.880
[gasping]

41:50.640 --> 41:52.160
[Adam] Something's happening with Ella.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.160
Um, she slipped out of school
without her protection officer.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.880
She wanted to walk home alone.
But she called me from the canal.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.840
She's very distressed. Something's wrong.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.160
Adam, what's happening?

42:02.240 --> 42:04.120
There's a chance someone's following her.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.200
We've lost contact, but there's
a response team on the way to her now.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.560
Adam, you find her.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.320
You just find her and you bring her home.

42:11.920 --> 42:12.880
I will.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.840
I promise.

42:14.920 --> 42:15.880
Okay.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.720
Fuck.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.400
[ominous music playing]

42:27.840 --> 42:29.840
[dialing]

42:31.040 --> 42:32.440
[ringing tone]

42:33.800 --> 42:35.480
[gasping and sobbing]

42:40.440 --> 42:41.280
[bleep]

42:41.360 --> 42:44.160
[whispering] This is between us,
all right? I did what you asked for.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.960
If you touch my daughter,

42:46.040 --> 42:49.080
I will use every means at my disposal
to fucking destroy you!

42:49.160 --> 42:50.000
No!

42:51.560 --> 42:53.480
[suspenseful music playing]
