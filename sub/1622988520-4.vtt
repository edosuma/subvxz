WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:09.052
Kevin and Allison,
together forever.

00:09.096 --> 00:12.055
<i>Previously on
"Kevin Can Himself."</i>

00:12.099 --> 00:13.839
Oh!

00:13.883 --> 00:16.016
I killed him with oxycodone
and then made it look like an
O.D.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.887
You'll have to wait
till I re-up Monday afternoon.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.889
-Thank you.
-Worcester PD.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.238
Everybody stay where you are.

00:21.282 --> 00:24.067
My friend was hauled off
in a pair of handcuffs,

00:24.111 --> 00:26.461
and my stash is in
an evidence bag somewhere.

00:26.504 --> 00:29.072
Does that mean that you're --Dry, no pills.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.900
I may have a connection
in Vermont.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.249
I think you should
come with me.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.903
Really?
I need a car.

00:33.946 --> 00:36.036
-You can borrow Kevin's.
-We'll go together.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.478
Anything good? Are we rich?

00:43.521 --> 00:46.089
64 cents, 9 screws,

00:46.133 --> 00:48.396
and a tooth with
a very large filling.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.225
Lemme see that.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.661
No, not mine.

00:54.663 --> 00:55.838
Nice tooth, though.

00:57.579 --> 01:00.103
I really thought the park would
have more good stuff.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.844
Hey, what do you say
we try your yard

01:01.887 --> 01:03.846
after we have lunch, some beers,
a nap, and dinner?

01:03.889 --> 01:05.282
Neil, I love ya,

01:05.326 --> 01:07.067
but it's high time
we abandon your

01:07.110 --> 01:10.244
get-rich-quick schemes in favor
of a get-wealthy-fast idea

01:10.287 --> 01:11.462
I recently had.

01:12.594 --> 01:13.725
Sounds way better.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.075
I'm listening.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.079
We're gonna open
our own escape room.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.732
I've never
heard of this thing,

01:20.776 --> 01:23.257
which immediately
makes me hate it.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.737
An escape room is
business idea, Dad.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.088
People pay good money to be
locked inside a room.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.741
Plus, we can do it
right here.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.092
We already got a basement
and a padlock.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.789
That's what they call
"low overhead."

01:35.182 --> 01:36.748
Please don't lock anyone
in my house.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.924
Babe, we are discussing

01:38.968 --> 01:40.883
business here, like
titans of industry.

01:40.926 --> 01:43.146
You wouldn't understand.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.669
Kev, look at
the first three letters

01:44.713 --> 01:46.976
of the word "titans."

01:50.153 --> 01:53.548
Kev. Kev. Kevin!

01:53.591 --> 01:56.116
-What, what, what?
-Where are the keys?

01:56.159 --> 01:57.334
What -- What do you need
the keys for?

01:57.378 --> 01:59.162
For the car.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.382
I'm taking Patty
to the Beauty Expo.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.471
Pretty sure I mentioned
that to you last night.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.386
And then again
this morning.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.953
I don't remember that,
and I remember everything.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.956
I must've forgotten
to ask.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.045
Ah, God,
how could I forget?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.656
I'm such an idiot.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.485
Here I was, gonna get
you guys a few handles of

02:17.528 --> 02:19.791
tequila from the duty-free
liquor store in New Hampshire.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.271
Whoa.
Hey, now.

02:21.315 --> 02:22.577
If you need the car,
you need the car.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.145
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.799
The keys are with
the wall spoons.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.584
Thanks, hon.

02:29.627 --> 02:33.196
Okay, we need to think of
a theme for our escape room.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.067
Last thing -- I have a corned
beef in the oven, so...

02:35.111 --> 02:36.591
Yep, yep, and for
advertising reasons,

02:36.634 --> 02:39.289
the theme should probably
rhyme with the word "room."

02:39.333 --> 02:41.378
...I need you to take it out
in a few hours, okay?

02:41.422 --> 02:42.988
Okay, let's think.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.817
What do people want
desperately to escape from?

02:45.861 --> 02:47.558
Escape...tomb.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.038
Anybody hear me?

02:49.081 --> 02:51.606
Escape womb.
Gotta get outta there.

02:51.649 --> 02:54.783
Ah.
Too disgusting.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.177
Alexa, can you please
set the timer for

02:57.220 --> 02:58.613
six hours from now?

02:58.656 --> 03:00.223
<i>Six hours, starting now.</i>

03:00.267 --> 03:03.400
Whoa, what'd you get it
going for?

03:03.444 --> 03:05.402
The beef
is in the oven.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.840
I'm leaving now.
Please don't burn down my house.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.625
Geez, babe, sure.

03:10.668 --> 03:13.889
Whoa, what do you need
the keys for?

03:13.932 --> 03:15.586
I can't.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.419
I mean,
Allison's cute and all,

03:22.463 --> 03:26.075
but sometimes I think
she thinks I'm an idiot.

03:26.118 --> 03:31.123
I tell ya, being married
really is...

03:31.167 --> 03:32.429
I know that look.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.779
Stroke!

03:34.823 --> 03:37.695
Neil, you can't just
scream out "stroke."

03:37.739 --> 03:40.089
-Fine. Genius stroke!
-No --

03:40.132 --> 03:41.786
No, no, both of you,
shut up.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.832
I've got our theme.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.226
Who wants
to escape the most?

03:46.269 --> 03:48.576
Just, like, drop everything
and go AWOL?

03:48.619 --> 03:49.664
-Priests.
-Shawshank.

03:49.707 --> 03:50.708
What?

03:51.970 --> 03:53.407
No, and no.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.886
There's a group
of people who have it

03:54.930 --> 03:58.238
even worse -- husbands.

03:58.281 --> 04:02.720
Boys, we're gonna make
an Escape Groom.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.897
Escape Groom. Right?

04:05.941 --> 04:07.116
You get it, Neil?

04:07.159 --> 04:08.160
Nope.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.177
One sec.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.920
Jesus, Allison, just come on in.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.884
Patty O'Connor?

04:35.927 --> 04:37.059
Yeah.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.321
Hello again.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.280
Detective Tammy Ridgeway.
Worcester PD.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.412
Uh, sorry.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.500
Have we --

04:43.544 --> 04:44.936
Not officially.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.982
I was at the pharmacy bust
a few days back.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.201
My partner took
a statement from you.

04:49.245 --> 04:52.466
Oh, right.
Yeah, uh, Detective Abraham.

04:52.509 --> 04:56.470
No. Just Bram. Bob Bram.

04:56.513 --> 05:00.082
Uh, that's --
that's a cool name.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.779
I just have a few
follow-up questions.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.738
You got a minute?

05:03.781 --> 05:06.523
Sure.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.699
Do you have any idea what
that bust was about?

05:08.743 --> 05:13.487
Well, you arrested a pharmacist,
so I assume...arson?

05:13.530 --> 05:17.186
Drug trafficking
and money-laundering.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.449
That's --
Geez, that's tough.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.711
Yeah.

05:20.755 --> 05:23.018
Guess he was supplying
dealers locally.

05:23.061 --> 05:27.457
Did you, uh -- did you know him,
the pharmacist?

05:27.501 --> 05:30.242
Yeah, we went to
the same high school.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.332
He was a band geek
who'd aggressively make out

05:32.375 --> 05:34.377
with his girlfriend
in yellow hall.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.553
And I'm not sure how
helpful that is.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.120
Well, it could be helpful
since he's been filling

05:38.163 --> 05:41.732
your prescription for
about a decade.

05:41.776 --> 05:44.256
Yeah, and the same guy's
owned the gas station

05:44.300 --> 05:45.562
at the corner
my whole life.

05:45.606 --> 05:48.217
I mean
I see him a lot more,

05:48.260 --> 05:49.740
and all I know about him
is that he hands me

05:49.784 --> 05:51.786
my cigarettes real well.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.703
"Memoirs of a Geisha."

05:55.746 --> 05:57.139
Any good?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.575
No idea.
Haven't read it yet.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.142
Well, they made a movie
out of it, right?

06:00.185 --> 06:01.230
So how bad can it be?

06:01.273 --> 06:05.234
It's next on my list.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.584
You got a lot of books.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.413
Yeah, uh, hey,
I just remembered,

06:10.457 --> 06:11.371
I-I'm running late
for something.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.373
Could we, um --
Sure thing.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.244
Just in case,
maybe wait a minute

06:15.287 --> 06:16.593
before you go
out of town.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.552
Okay?

06:18.595 --> 06:20.554
Yeah, you bet.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.881
Hey.
Hey.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.970
Whoa, I'm driving.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.015
It's my car.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.017
No, it's Kevin's car.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.454
And we're going four hours to
meet my guy with the drugs.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.456
Yeah, but the drugs
are for me.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.023
They're for Jared.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.590
Jason.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.853
Like "Friday the 13th."

06:58.896 --> 07:01.769
No one's ever been scared of
a guy named Jared before.

07:01.812 --> 07:02.987
Okay.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.467
They're for
Freddy Krueger --

07:04.511 --> 07:06.121
to get him off your
back or whatever.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.427
You like
slasher films, too?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.211
We're not bonding, okay?

07:09.254 --> 07:11.909
And you're not driving 'cause
you're like a tourist here,

07:11.953 --> 07:14.129
and tourists should never
be allowed to drive.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.261
Gimme those.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.568
Hope you have
a strong bladder.

07:18.612 --> 07:21.615
I don't make stops.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.491
And we're off like
a herd of turtles.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.597
I'm going 60.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.210
Fathead.

07:52.254 --> 07:55.300
Oh, look at his plates.
He's from North Dakota.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.954
That's exotic.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.521
Exotic?

07:58.565 --> 08:01.350
Well, it's far.
Better than here.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.308
You think North Dakota's
better than Worcester?

08:03.352 --> 08:06.529
I mean, yeah, probably.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.531
What about you?

08:08.575 --> 08:12.187
Well, I have this theory.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.536
Everywhere's bad.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.541
North Dakota, Worcester,
Florida --

08:18.585 --> 08:20.151
nowhere's better
than anywhere else.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.153
They're all just bad
in their own way.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.546
Florida's humid.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.548
North Dakota
probably has,

08:25.592 --> 08:28.333
I don't know,
snakes or whatever.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.553
I bet France
has its shit.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.946
So everywhere's bad?

08:31.989 --> 08:33.121
Everywhere's bad.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.905
I don't know.

08:34.949 --> 08:38.169
I'd like to see
different places.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.171
Maybe I should've
been a trucker.

08:40.215 --> 08:43.566
Just me and Celine Dion's
second CD,

08:43.610 --> 08:45.568
and I'd just stock up
on beef jerky.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.570
You do not eat
beef jerky.

08:47.614 --> 08:51.574
I would if I could
ever go anywhere.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.142
My dad was a trucker
back in the '80s.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.971
Wasn't exactly
Walden on wheels, okay?

08:57.014 --> 09:01.105
It's just a bunch of guys
racing through traffic,

09:01.149 --> 09:02.803
dealing with some
combination of drugs,

09:02.846 --> 09:05.719
diabetes,
and slipped disks.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.895
The times my dad
was actually home,

09:07.938 --> 09:10.550
I wished he'd go back
out on the road.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.989
Your mom want him home?

09:15.032 --> 09:16.338
No idea.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.993
She died
when we were kids.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.169
Neil found her.

09:21.212 --> 09:24.172
Oh, my God.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.608
I'm so sorry.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.218
Settle down.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.569
It's not
like you did it.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.834
Actually, I did.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.663
I wanted your trucker dad
all to myself.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.581
That's funny.

09:47.674 --> 09:48.979
Okay.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.721
Kev, I -- I got a little
business question.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.028
Yes, you can be
the vice president of

09:54.071 --> 09:57.205
the Escape Groom's
parent company, KevIndustries.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.817
That's -- wow,
that's very generous,

10:00.861 --> 10:03.777
and I formally accept,
but my question's about

10:03.820 --> 10:05.256
how we get
actual customers.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.041
There's a lot of
escape rooms out there.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.869
This escape room is
gonna be better than

10:08.912 --> 10:12.263
all the others because
ours has a twist.

10:12.307 --> 10:17.094
We are gonna offer $10,000 to
any team that escapes.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.271
-Follow-up question.
-Yes.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.317
How? <i></i>

10:22.360 --> 10:24.319
'Cause $10,000 is, like,

10:24.362 --> 10:26.887
$12,000 more than you
have in the bank.

10:26.930 --> 10:30.238
That's where my top-secret
second twist comes into play --

10:30.281 --> 10:32.806
this room is inescapable.

10:32.849 --> 10:36.244
I-I get it, but I don't
think Pete does,

10:36.287 --> 10:38.638
so maybe explain it
so he understands.

10:40.291 --> 10:44.992
Our clues are so c--
our clues are so complicated,

10:45.035 --> 10:46.689
they basically
lead nowhere.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.083
So we just hide
the key somewhere random,

10:49.126 --> 10:50.911
and then when time's up,
it's like,

10:50.954 --> 10:53.522
"Sorry, your book smarts
didn't help ya here."

10:53.565 --> 10:55.045
Pure "Good Will Hunting."

10:56.481 --> 10:58.658
"What about <i>
the</i> apples?"

10:59.746 --> 11:01.486
You misquote
that movie again,

11:01.530 --> 11:04.141
I'm taking away your
Massachusetts driver's license.

11:04.185 --> 11:07.318
Now, all we gotta do
is print out the fliers

11:07.362 --> 11:09.364
to pass out all over town.

11:09.407 --> 11:13.063
Except I don't know how
to work the printer.

11:13.107 --> 11:16.153
Or the computer.

11:16.197 --> 11:19.504
Luckily, I know someone who's
an expert at explaining

11:19.548 --> 11:22.290
simple tasks to me
like I'm a toddler.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.560
Send it to voicemail.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.693
Won't he think we're
up to something?

11:33.736 --> 11:36.173
If you don't
pick up one time?

11:36.217 --> 11:38.349
Come on. It's fine.

11:41.657 --> 11:42.745
Jesus.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.094
How many times
is he gonna call?

11:44.138 --> 11:45.574
I don't know.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.924
What, you always pick up?

11:55.453 --> 11:57.891
See? World didn't end.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.936
We're all still here.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.158
Keep an eye out for
Ardmore Lane, would ya?

12:04.201 --> 12:05.899
Why don't you just
use your phone?

12:05.942 --> 12:07.596
And have this guy's
address in there?

12:07.639 --> 12:09.859
Come on, Barbie.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.513
Who even is this guy?

12:11.556 --> 12:13.733
He's a guy a I know from
high school who still deals.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.083
Moved up here
a few years ago.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.780
Rick DiNunzio.

12:17.824 --> 12:21.958
Wait, we're buying drugs
from a DiNunzio?

12:22.002 --> 12:23.568
Thought I missed out
on my chance to do that

12:23.612 --> 12:24.787
in high school.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.311
Never indulged in that
rite of passage.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.617
I'm shocked.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.751
Ah, but everyone got their
stuff from DiNunzio.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.970
Rick wasn't in my year,
but one of them

12:34.014 --> 12:35.755
pissed in the pool and got
my swim meet canceled.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.192
Which one?
Joey? Ronnie? Deena?

12:38.235 --> 12:40.803
Davy.
Ah. Davy.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.807
He loved
to piss on things.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.418
Um, also, how did I not
know we went to

12:47.462 --> 12:49.203
the same high school?

12:49.246 --> 12:53.642
Because up until 20 minutes ago,
I didn't know I liked you.

12:53.685 --> 12:56.558
After 10 years?

12:56.601 --> 12:59.169
What changed your mind?

12:59.213 --> 13:01.824
When you said
you killed my mom.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.368
You sure you got
the right address?

13:24.412 --> 13:26.196
Yep.

13:26.240 --> 13:30.679
I just didn't think a drug den
would be so Town & Country.

13:30.722 --> 13:33.464
Oh, okay,
this makes more sense.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.467
No, no.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.818
Hands and feet inside
the tour bus at all times.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.189
He said to wait
by the lawn mower.

14:07.716 --> 14:11.851
Oh, no. Come on.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.506
Patricia?

14:15.550 --> 14:18.292
Yeah. Who are you?

14:18.335 --> 14:20.860
I'm Jif, Rick's step-son.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.339
Where's Rick?

14:22.383 --> 14:25.081
He's at work,
but he said you'd be by.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.822
Come in.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.747
Wow. I like your room.

14:38.790 --> 14:43.012
Kind of Pinterest-rustic.

14:44.971 --> 14:48.322
Uh, Rick said that you had
some newspapers for --

14:48.365 --> 14:51.412
What?
Trevor, turn that down.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.241
Rick said you had
some newspapers.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.329
For $250?

14:55.372 --> 14:56.852
Right.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.125
What?

15:09.169 --> 15:10.735
What the hell
are these?

15:10.779 --> 15:11.954
Newspapers.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.522
No, we wanted Oxys,
not cocaine.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.089
Well, then you should've
asked for magazines,

15:16.132 --> 15:17.568
not newspapers.

15:17.612 --> 15:20.310
We change up the names sometimes
for security reasons.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.791
Okay.
Okay, well, uh,

15:22.834 --> 15:24.401
we would like some
magazines, then.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.577
Sorry, Rick just traded
the last of our magazines

15:26.621 --> 15:28.623
for those newspapers
you asked for.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.277
Come on.
Are you kidding me?

15:30.320 --> 15:33.149
Okay, uh, well,
we don't want this,

15:33.193 --> 15:35.151
and, uh, we would just
like our money back, please.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.370
Whoa!

15:36.413 --> 15:37.980
Jesus Christ.

15:38.024 --> 15:42.028
Trevor, just walk it
to the garbage can.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.989
-Yeah, uh, we don't really have

15:47.033 --> 15:48.599
an exchange policy.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.950
I mean, you could always try
and trade the guy back,

15:50.993 --> 15:52.952
but he'll probably just
mark up the price.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.388
Who'd he give
the Oxys to?

15:54.431 --> 15:55.606
No idea.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.000
I went with Rick.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.176
Buy me a 12-pack,
and I'll take you to the guy.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.613
What? No.
You're like 13 years old.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.964
-Six-pack?
-Done.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.140
Sure. Take Trevor.

16:07.183 --> 16:10.012
And I suggest you leave this one
at home next time.

16:10.056 --> 16:13.407
She's looking mighty custy.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.017
Custy?

16:15.061 --> 16:18.325
Like an obvious customer.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.849
I <i>am</i> a customer.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.201
That's me.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.856
Jesus, Allison.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.901
Sorry.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.427
Declined.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.778
I don't understand why
she's not picking up.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.562
First she leaves me
hanging with the printer,

16:38.606 --> 16:41.174
and now I can't find
my lucky Bruins hat.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.914
How is this business venture

16:42.958 --> 16:45.830
supposed to work if I can't
find my lucky hat?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.920
Son, we don't need luck.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.705
Besides, some of these
clues seem hard.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.272
They are pretty good.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.056
I mean, why does this
bus ticket go to numbers?

16:54.100 --> 16:57.233
Those are coordinates to
Kissimmee, Florida.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.149
It's where you'd hide out
while your would-be bride

17:00.193 --> 17:02.064
deals with returning
all the wedding gifts.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.067
Why Kissimmee, though?

17:05.111 --> 17:08.418
Well, obviously, Kissimmee is
an anagram for "Me-me-I-kiss."

17:08.462 --> 17:12.466
So they have to
kiss the mirror

17:12.509 --> 17:17.036
at the altar in order
to get the next clue.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.560
How many more clues
like this are there?

17:19.603 --> 17:21.475
A trail of 56.

17:21.518 --> 17:24.434
Each one less solvable
than the last.

17:24.478 --> 17:28.308
And if they somehow manage
to get to the final clue,

17:28.351 --> 17:30.745
they have to find
the word "pipe" spelled out

17:30.788 --> 17:34.096
on four separate,
individual grains of rice.

17:34.140 --> 17:38.840
Only then can they find
the key.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.668
On the pipe.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.411
I've never been more
proud of you, son.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.766
Oh, God, it smells
good out here.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.289
Where is that kid?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.335
How do I know?
I'm out here, same as you.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.252
Jesus.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.949
He programmed it so it
always when he calls.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.646
I don't know how to undo it.

18:02.690 --> 18:06.868
You turn it off,
that's how.

18:06.911 --> 18:07.956
Okay.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.480
Phone time's over.
See?

18:12.003 --> 18:14.528
Great.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.185
Trevor said he'd be right out.
Now he's just being rude.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.797
This is how
it works, okay?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.494
The pill connect
probably works inside,

18:24.538 --> 18:26.322
and Trevor will bring him
out on his next break.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.759
Stop being so custy.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.110
Come on. You didn't know
that word either.

18:33.634 --> 18:37.159
There he is. See?

18:37.203 --> 18:41.120
So I guess
that's his connect?

18:41.163 --> 18:43.339
Looks like they have
a very professional

18:43.383 --> 18:45.167
business relationship.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.560
Oh, I see.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.866
You're funny
all the time now, huh?

18:50.955 --> 18:52.131
Who are you?

18:52.174 --> 18:55.612
I'm Brittani.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.179
What's in the bag?

18:57.223 --> 19:00.182
Burgers.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.576
It's a burger place.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.013
I just had to go
pick up my girl, you know,

19:05.056 --> 19:06.623
before we go get my beers.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.583
Look, I'm not
new here, okay?

19:09.626 --> 19:12.020
You can't extort me
into being your taxi.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.762
Um, I kinda can.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.981
Unless you don't
need any pills.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.034
These are
basically mine.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.602
Um...

19:28.645 --> 19:31.561
That's good.
Very crunchy.

19:31.605 --> 19:32.823
Good.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.788
Um, the fliers worked.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.093
There's like five
people outside.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.051
Ka-ching!

19:44.226 --> 19:45.793
Alright, it's go time.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.403
Everyone, we need to
get into character.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.971
Dad, remember, you're
the kindly priest who signals

19:50.014 --> 19:54.105
with his eyes that the groom
should say, "I don't."

19:54.149 --> 19:55.237
Got it.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.065
Neil, you're the emcee.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.807
The emcee?
But I can't rap.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.637
Last time I tried,
I just rhymed the word "snake"

20:03.680 --> 20:06.248
with "snake" over and over again
until the guy unplugged

20:06.292 --> 20:07.336
my microphone.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.642
No, no, no.

20:08.685 --> 20:11.253
You're the host, like
a strip-club deejay.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.863
Your job is to make us
comfortable without

20:12.907 --> 20:14.604
distracting from
the main event.

20:14.648 --> 20:15.866
The butts and the boobs.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.433
Exactly.

20:17.477 --> 20:20.262
And finally,
I'm gonna go "UnderKever Boss"

20:20.306 --> 20:21.263
on these suckas.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.439
Oh. <i></i>

20:23.483 --> 20:27.269
'Course, I know what you mean,
but Neil seems lost.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.271
I'm gonna
pose as a customer.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.274
The others will quickly
identify my smarts and charisma

20:32.318 --> 20:34.885
and elect me as their leader
and ask me to supervise

20:34.929 --> 20:36.452
the escape mission.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.889
And then you subtly
guide them off-course.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.283
Even better,
I play hard to get.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.373
"Who me? I couldn't possibly
solve these clues.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.941
Maybe that drip over there
should be in charge."

20:46.984 --> 20:49.596
You little tease.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.250
You can milk the clock
all the way down

20:51.293 --> 20:52.512
to the buzzer that way.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.296
And I intend to.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.472
Get ready to be rich
as hell, boys.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.908
Welcome.

20:57.952 --> 21:01.303
Please be sure all phones
are in the basket.

21:01.347 --> 21:05.133
There will be no
cheating allowed.

21:05.176 --> 21:09.268
I will be locking
the door behind you.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.923
Already left my phone in
the car, whoever you are.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.708
Nice.

21:14.751 --> 21:20.061
You have one hour to escape
and win $10,000.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.497
Where are the clues?

21:21.541 --> 21:25.545
God and the priest
only knows.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.200
Hey, wow.
Um, you two look alike.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.506
Don't they look like
they could be related?

21:30.550 --> 21:33.466
What? I'm way better
looking than him.

21:35.337 --> 21:39.863
My son, God does
not like questions.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.561
And begin!

21:42.213 --> 21:44.215
Well, I-I guess we need someone
to take charge.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.348
Uh, how about you?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.350
Who me?
I don't know if I should.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.699
Okay, then, I'll do it.

21:49.743 --> 21:50.744
What?

21:50.787 --> 21:52.136
I'll find out what
the priest knows

21:52.180 --> 21:53.312
while you all go through
the clues.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.661
That mirror.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.010
It looks important.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.882
Um...

21:58.926 --> 22:00.884
I think there are coordinates
on this bus ticket.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.364
I'm a pilot.

22:02.408 --> 22:05.106
Looks like that's
Kissimmee, Florida.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.977
Must be some
sort of anagram.

22:07.021 --> 22:09.589
Uh, Kissimmee --
"Me Me I Kiss"?

22:11.286 --> 22:14.681
Ah, good ideas,
all around.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.049
Oop, we're here.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.704
Damn, drive normal.
You have coke in the car.

22:37.747 --> 22:40.054
Nobody cares how I'm driving.
We're in Vermont.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.838
Live free or die, right?

22:41.882 --> 22:43.231
That's New Hampshire.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.842
Same thing.
Same thing.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.931
We're here?

22:47.975 --> 22:49.019
We're in
the middle of nowhere.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.543
Too bad.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.805
Now, where's this guy
with the pills?

22:51.848 --> 22:53.415
I told you he's at the mall.

22:53.459 --> 22:57.027
Oh, yeah? Or am I just your
chauffeur to Hot Topic?

23:01.031 --> 23:04.165
Dude hangs out in a parking lot
by Centennial Woods.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.775
He goes by Red Rooster.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.038
Come on.
-Green light.

23:08.082 --> 23:11.172
Shh. Keep going.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.043
His truck's usually
parked out there.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.828
Do not get out of the car.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.221
You pull up, honk twice,
and he'll get in the back seat

23:17.265 --> 23:18.788
so you can do your business
on the move.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.400
Thank you
for being honest.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.966
That's the last stop on
the bang bus.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.403
Now get out.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.405
-Are you serious?
-Yep.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.406
Bitch.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.408
That's right.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.280
Nice mouth.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.283
Good luck, custies.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.851
Thank you.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.635
Really?

23:46.512 --> 23:49.079
Phyllis, I'm almost
done decoding the vows.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.080
Way to go, Asher!

23:50.124 --> 23:51.995
Yeah.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.650
Wait, guys, I found a grain of
rice with a letter on it.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.130
Ooh!

23:56.173 --> 23:57.305
At this rate,
we'll have that

23:57.348 --> 23:59.350
10,000 bucks
in no time.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.222
Hang on. Hang on.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.876
Let's back up
for a second here.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.444
Tall guy wanted me
to be in charge at first,

24:05.487 --> 24:07.228
and there must've been
a reason for that.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.708
Not really.
It was just sort of random.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.100
It wasn't random!

24:10.144 --> 24:11.885
It wasn't.

24:11.928 --> 24:15.454
You had an instinct, and I think
that we should honor that.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.499
Fair enough.
Um, we got some extra time.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.849
So, uh,
what's your suggestion?

24:19.893 --> 24:22.852
Right, like I'm just gonna
tell you my suggestion

24:22.896 --> 24:25.594
so you can repeat it back louder
and get credit for it

24:25.638 --> 24:27.378
like I do with
Kelly's jokes at work?

24:27.422 --> 24:30.469
Nice try.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.646
I'll be strategizing with
each of you individually.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.038
Tall guy, you're up first.
Come on.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.521
I guess you're a pretty good
leader after all.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.480
Looks like you just
found the key!

24:41.523 --> 24:42.611
Hey!

24:42.655 --> 24:44.483
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.962
This is a fake key.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.877
Look, ugh, you can just
snap it right in half.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.274
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

24:53.317 --> 24:54.884
It looks like your
hand is bleeding.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.757
No, it's, uh -- it's --
it's just jelly 'cause --

24:57.800 --> 25:00.107
'cause it's a candy key
with filling in it.

25:00.150 --> 25:03.110
See?
The key is food.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.732
Ahh!

25:23.347 --> 25:26.699
I can't believe we're meeting
a guy named Red Rooster.

25:26.742 --> 25:30.093
Trevor seemed to know what
he was talking about.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.878
This place is creepy.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.575
It's a parking lot.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.143
Yeah, well, you like
slasher movies.

25:36.186 --> 25:39.233
Don't hang out in
parking garages or parking lots

25:39.276 --> 25:44.107
or help a guy move a couch
into his creepy van.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.632
Okay.
Maybe you have a point.

26:06.434 --> 26:09.219
-Oh, God.
-It's fine.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.699
Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.179
-Don't talk.
-I'm not gonna --

26:12.222 --> 26:14.224
Don't. Allison.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.143
Yeah?

26:20.187 --> 26:23.625
We're looking for... Red.

26:23.669 --> 26:27.411
Uh, Rooster?

26:27.455 --> 26:30.676
Okay. Good. Um...

26:36.072 --> 26:38.031
We're looking to trade.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.598
Oh.

26:41.643 --> 26:45.473
Okay. Let's go.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.344
Yeah.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.999
We can't get out
of the car, remember?

26:50.043 --> 26:51.522
Right, change of plans.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.002
No, Trevor said we can't --

26:53.046 --> 26:55.962
Trevor is 13.

26:56.005 --> 26:59.095
There's no, like, right way
to do this shit, Allison.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.271
There's nothing right
about any of it.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.666
And now they have
our coke. So...

27:05.885 --> 27:07.451
...I either go with them,

27:07.495 --> 27:09.628
or we go back empty-handed
to Worcester.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.108
Lock the door.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.849
Well, be careful.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.986
Look, we could keep
re-litigating

27:20.029 --> 27:23.076
my correct choice to eat
that fake food key, or --

27:25.992 --> 27:28.516
Or we could start looking for

27:28.559 --> 27:31.519
the real key
and win that moolah.

27:31.562 --> 27:35.262
Okay?
Alright, so who's with me?

27:38.178 --> 27:39.658
Maybe you should just
let us all out.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.137
I think
he needs a doctor.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.314
Hour's up!
No one escaped!

27:44.358 --> 27:47.100
Oh! Oh, yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

27:47.143 --> 27:48.536
It feels so good.

27:48.579 --> 27:50.103
He was in on it
the whole time.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.715
"Good Will Hunting'd"
all of ya.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.805
How do those apples feel?

27:56.849 --> 27:58.720
We all knew you were
a part of it, okay?

27:58.764 --> 28:00.504
Can we just leave, please?

28:00.548 --> 28:02.158
Yeah, and you two
are related, right?

28:02.202 --> 28:04.378
My son,
that's strike two.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.858
You're out.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.599
This is honestly getting
really upsetting.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.863
Oh-ho-ho.
Sore losers, much?

28:10.906 --> 28:14.040
Neil, will you please find
the real key

28:14.083 --> 28:15.824
and slide it
under the door.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.304
Sure thing.
Where is it again?

28:17.347 --> 28:18.740
Uh, it's on my key ring.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.742
It says "Dilly Dilly" on it.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.831
Okay.
I'm not seeing it.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.486
Hey, didn't Allison take your
keys this morning?

28:25.529 --> 28:26.922
Oh, Jesus.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.924
Don't sweat it, gang.
I'll get you out.

28:28.968 --> 28:32.058
I may just sort of need to
chop the door down.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.407
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28:33.450 --> 28:36.279
Allison got so mad at us
last time we did that.

28:36.323 --> 28:39.979
No, no, go get your power drill
and screw off the hinges.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.285
I loaned my drill
to my cousin Terry.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.722
Oh, Terry
still up in Grafton?

28:43.765 --> 28:45.941
Nah, they moved.
Terry's in Shrewsbury.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.203
Yeah, yeah?
How's he liking it?

28:47.247 --> 28:48.770
He loves it.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.163
They got a Buffalo Wild Wings
there now.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.947
Ah, they got the best
commercials, don't they?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.383
Hello?

28:53.427 --> 28:55.429
What is happening?

28:55.472 --> 28:58.171
Oh, hey, hey,
run up to Shrewsbury,

28:58.214 --> 28:59.172
come back,
drill us out.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.564
You got it.

29:00.608 --> 29:01.783
How long will this take?

29:01.827 --> 29:02.958
Uh, 30 minutes.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.223
Alexa, stop!

29:07.267 --> 29:10.749
That was weird.
Wonder who set that.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.414
Uh...

29:28.854 --> 29:31.682
Oh, thank God.

29:39.212 --> 29:42.606
-Okay, so, don't freak out.
-Okay.

29:42.650 --> 29:43.825
I didn't get you the Oxys,

29:43.869 --> 29:47.002
but I did get you
something else.

29:47.046 --> 29:49.222
Something I'd argue
is far more useful.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.180
They gave you a gun?
What the hell?

29:51.224 --> 29:52.834
Shh.
I need the pills.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.096
What am I gonna do
with a gun?

29:54.140 --> 29:55.663
You're gonna protect yourself,
that's what.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.056
You don't have to worry
about Jason Voorhees

29:57.099 --> 29:58.797
shaking you down
anymore.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.233
Just point this at him,
and he'll leave you alone.

30:00.276 --> 30:01.234
Just point it at him?

30:01.277 --> 30:03.889
Yeah, here. Take it.
No!

30:04.759 --> 30:07.849
Come on.

30:07.893 --> 30:12.462
You already killed my mom.
What's the big deal?

30:14.029 --> 30:16.815
Chill out, Barbie.
It's not even loaded.

30:20.296 --> 30:21.950
I was alone with them
in the woods.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.517
What was I supposed to do?
Just hand the gun back?

30:23.560 --> 30:26.085
Yes!

30:26.128 --> 30:27.695
Fine. You know what?

30:27.738 --> 30:29.001
You do the deals
from now on.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.654
-Wait, where are we going?
-Home.

30:30.698 --> 30:31.742
No.
This was a bust.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.266
Wait, no, please.

30:33.309 --> 30:34.963
-No, we're getting out of here.
-No, please. Wait. Sorry.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.531
I -- I didn't mean
to sound ungrateful.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.838
I just -- I really
need those pills.

30:39.881 --> 30:42.841
I didn't want to worry you,
but that guy,

30:42.884 --> 30:46.235
I don't know what he can do,
what he's capable of.

30:46.279 --> 30:50.457
He started stalking me,
following me everywhere I go.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.285
Okay, so take the gun --

30:52.328 --> 30:55.897
No, Patty, I-I jump out of
my skin when I hear a car horn.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.725
I'm not gonna carry
around a gun.

30:57.768 --> 31:02.512
I just need those pills
so he'll leave me alone.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.688
Please.

31:04.732 --> 31:07.822
I can't live
like this anymore.

31:11.782 --> 31:14.785
There's one more
place I can try.

31:14.829 --> 31:16.048
But it's two hours away.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.919
Okay. Yes. Yes.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.878
Thank you. I'm in.

31:19.921 --> 31:22.445
Get your
hand off my hand.

31:22.489 --> 31:24.447
Okay.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.406
Thank you.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.892
Why does it smell
like camping?

31:33.935 --> 31:35.458
Is that smoke?

31:35.502 --> 31:40.159
Smells like
corned beef.

31:40.202 --> 31:43.902
One of you guys put
a corned beef in my oven?

31:43.945 --> 31:46.905
Oh, I think
my wife did it.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.037
God, how dare she leave

31:49.081 --> 31:50.952
and let everything
go to hell like this.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.389
Great, so now we're gonna die
of smoke inhalation?

31:53.433 --> 31:55.609
Okay, okay,
just cool it, alright?

31:55.652 --> 31:57.567
We just gotta air the place out
a little bit.

31:57.611 --> 32:00.353
You know,
get some ventilation.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.183
Wait, there's a window?

32:04.226 --> 32:06.359
Okay, uh, why didn't
you guys tell us

32:06.402 --> 32:07.534
there was a way out?

32:07.577 --> 32:09.275
'Cause it's not.

32:09.318 --> 32:14.410
It's clearly too small
for any actual adult to...

32:14.454 --> 32:15.498
fit through.

32:29.425 --> 32:31.210
You pump.
I'm gonna get a Red Bull

32:31.253 --> 32:33.864
and stock up on menthols
while we're outta state.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.170
You want a Red Bull?

32:35.214 --> 32:37.651
Ooh, no thanks.
That stuff freaks me out.

32:37.694 --> 32:38.957
All those chemicals?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.960
Yes, you're such
a puritan.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.390
Allison?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.007
Allison?!

33:32.749 --> 33:34.273
Sorry.

33:34.316 --> 33:37.232
I'm sure I brought some
emergency cash from home.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.539
Take your time.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.194
Oh, shoot.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.896
Oh!

33:48.939 --> 33:50.158
Patty, what the hell
are you doing?

33:50.202 --> 33:51.899
I can't believe
he followed you here.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.031
What?

33:53.074 --> 33:55.685
That --
isn't that the guy?

33:55.729 --> 33:57.078
Jason?

33:57.122 --> 34:00.690
No, this isn't Jason.
This is just some guy.

34:00.734 --> 34:03.693
I -- but, uh,
I was saving you.

34:03.737 --> 34:05.695
Patty,
we gotta go, okay?

34:05.739 --> 34:06.740
I was saving you.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.437
Honey,
that wasn't the guy.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.570
We gotta go now. Okay?

34:15.749 --> 34:18.491
Okay, come on. Come on.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.128
You okay?

34:47.172 --> 34:48.303
Want me to
turn down the heat?

34:48.347 --> 34:49.304
No.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.176
Okay.

34:51.219 --> 34:52.220
You mind?

34:58.835 --> 35:00.576
Let's just
go home, okay?

35:00.620 --> 35:02.535
Mm-hmm.

35:03.797 --> 35:07.017
Hey, it's fine.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.541
Everything's
gonna be fine.

35:13.589 --> 35:14.938
Allison?

35:14.982 --> 35:16.984
It's going to be fine.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.339
Oh, God.

35:24.383 --> 35:25.558
It's fine.
What the hell?

35:25.601 --> 35:27.168
Stop saying it's fine.
This isn't --

35:27.212 --> 35:29.127
Listen, my dad
was a cop, okay?

35:29.170 --> 35:32.173
Just sit there and try not
to look so terrified.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.132
Jesus.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.921
License and registration.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.141
Of course.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.796
Sorry. I'm nervous.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.537
Never been pulled over before.

35:48.581 --> 35:51.366
Did I, um -- did I not
signal to something?

35:51.410 --> 35:52.976
Name?

35:53.020 --> 35:54.717
Allison Devine McRoberts.

35:54.761 --> 35:58.156
Devine is my maiden name.
My father was Les Devine.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.809
He worked for
the Worcester Police --

35:59.853 --> 36:01.028
And you.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.726
Uh, P-Patty. Um, P--

36:03.770 --> 36:06.076
Um, Patricia O'Connor.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.775
Quite a ways from Worcester.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.559
What's your business
in Vermont?

36:10.603 --> 36:14.389
Oh, we were, uh -- we were
attending a Beauty Expo.

36:14.433 --> 36:17.175
Doesn't look like you
bought anything.

36:20.656 --> 36:23.616
Do you have any idea why this
car was reported stolen?

36:23.659 --> 36:25.226
Stolen?

36:25.270 --> 36:27.054
This is
my husband's car.

36:27.097 --> 36:30.710
The report was filed by
a Kevin McRoberts.

36:35.845 --> 36:38.370
I am such an idiot.

36:38.413 --> 36:42.243
I, um -- I borrowed the car,
and I just --

36:42.287 --> 36:44.593
I forgot to tell him
how long I'd be gone.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.421
And then my phone died.

36:47.901 --> 36:51.209
I am so, so sorry, officer,

36:51.252 --> 36:52.471
for wasting your time.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.647
I completely understand
if we need to

36:54.690 --> 36:57.954
come down to the station
till we sort this out.

37:04.396 --> 37:05.788
I don't think we need
to do all that.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.139
Last name and address
are the same.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.881
Doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure this one out.

37:11.925 --> 37:15.276
Maybe use your friend's phone
and call your hubby?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.451
Check in.

37:16.495 --> 37:17.887
'Course.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.237
Thank you so much.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.455
Sorry.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.718
Drive safe.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.721
Thank you.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.470
Thank you.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.907
Anytime.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.873
Thank you so much.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.272
Wow.

37:56.535 --> 38:01.322
Oh, my God.
He called the cops?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.846
Because you didn't
answer your phone?

38:03.890 --> 38:05.500
No.

38:05.544 --> 38:08.024
I'm sure he had
a great reason.

38:16.163 --> 38:19.514
Kevin, you called
the police?

38:19.558 --> 38:20.863
What was I supposed to do?

38:20.907 --> 38:22.517
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.127
I thought you'd been
Liam Neeson "Taken."

38:25.912 --> 38:27.653
I pictured you lying dead
in the trunk

38:27.696 --> 38:29.872
with some thug
driving off in my car.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.963
I was scared and concerned,
and I'm so relieved

38:34.007 --> 38:37.532
that you're okay because
I can't find the Crisco.

38:37.576 --> 38:38.794
Pull!

38:41.231 --> 38:43.669
Pull!

38:43.712 --> 38:45.540
It's in the pantry.

38:45.584 --> 38:48.978
Top shelf.
It says "Crisco" on it.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.199
No, I don't know where
your Bruins hat is.

38:52.242 --> 38:54.810
Have you checked
in your closet?

38:54.854 --> 38:57.160
Okay, anything else?

38:58.466 --> 39:03.210
Like I just said,
the Crisco is in the pantry.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.343
Okay?

39:07.606 --> 39:09.999
And that's why I should've
picked up the phone.

39:10.043 --> 39:12.611
So it's my fault?

39:12.654 --> 39:14.700
Like I could've predicted
he'd do something like

39:14.743 --> 39:16.223
call the cops?
Yeah.

39:16.266 --> 39:17.485
You've been hanging out
with him for 10 years.

39:17.529 --> 39:20.227
But this -- this is --

39:20.270 --> 39:22.011
Different?

39:22.055 --> 39:24.231
Yeah.

39:24.274 --> 39:28.844
Okay.
Okay.

39:28.888 --> 39:32.370
Patty, do you remember when
I got that job as a paralegal?

39:32.413 --> 39:35.024
I started working a lot,
and Kevin convinced everyone

39:35.068 --> 39:36.591
I was having an affair?

39:36.635 --> 39:41.161
My money was on cult.
But, yeah.

39:41.204 --> 39:43.381
He thought that
I'd fallen in love with my boss,

39:43.424 --> 39:45.600
who was 60 and married.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.080
But that didn't matter.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.429
Kevin still put sugar
in his gas tank.

39:48.473 --> 39:49.822
Ruined his Saturn.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.564
Okay, fine, I never said
he was a great guy.

39:52.607 --> 39:55.175
But that's the kind of
juvenile crap he does.

39:55.218 --> 39:58.831
Patty, he got me fired.

39:58.874 --> 40:04.314
Right when I felt like I was
worth something.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.578
He ruined it.

40:08.493 --> 40:11.409
And you just watched
him and laughed.

40:13.236 --> 40:16.892
Can you just think about that
for more than one second?

40:16.936 --> 40:19.068
He didn't like something
that was my own,

40:19.112 --> 40:20.983
and so he took it
away from me.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.637
Like this car.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.030
Like my friends.

40:24.073 --> 40:27.337
Like any shred of a life
that is my own.

40:27.381 --> 40:29.514
I-It...

40:31.603 --> 40:36.129
It seemed...harmless.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.087
And when he spent
all our life savings

40:38.131 --> 40:40.089
without telling me?

40:40.133 --> 40:42.048
Was that harmless, too?

41:05.854 --> 41:08.074
I...

41:09.989 --> 41:12.687
I'm sorry.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.124
Why?

41:15.168 --> 41:18.084
Wasn't your fault.
It's Kevin's.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.696
The world revolves around him.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.699
No, it's not that it does,
it's that it has to.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.832
And if it doesn't,
he just blows it to hell.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.051
And it has to stop.

41:29.095 --> 41:30.923
I have to beat him.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.491
So you're going on
benders,

41:33.534 --> 41:34.970
ripping off
dangerous guys?

41:35.014 --> 41:36.537
That's how you're
dealing with it?

41:36.581 --> 41:38.670
You're smarter than that.

41:38.713 --> 41:42.151
No, I'm not
ripping anyone off.

41:42.195 --> 41:45.111
No one's after me.

41:45.154 --> 41:49.202
Nobody except my husband.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.900
I need those pills for him.

41:53.989 --> 41:56.514
'Cause I'm gonna kill Kevin.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.801
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out

42:22.844 --> 42:24.542
what you two did
on your road trip?!

42:26.065 --> 42:27.545
Allison?
Jenn!

42:27.588 --> 42:28.981
Hey!
Hi!

42:29.024 --> 42:30.548
I need to talk to you.

42:30.591 --> 42:32.201
Now.
Okay.

42:32.245 --> 42:33.986
Who the hell are you?
How'd you get in here?

42:34.029 --> 42:35.770
Give me some pills,
honey.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.598
Where were you tonight,
Allison?

42:37.642 --> 42:39.208
How am I gonna
explain this to Kevin?

42:39.252 --> 42:40.819
Some criminal mastermind
you'd be.
