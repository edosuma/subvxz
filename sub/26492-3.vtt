00:08.258 --> 00:09.718
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:09.801 --> 00:13.304
Dilton Doiley and Ben Button were found
in the woods with blue lips.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.807
We made a pact
to never revisit that night.

00:15.890 --> 00:19.060
-Gryphons and Gargoyles.
-Wonder if Ethel was playing with them.

00:19.144 --> 00:22.605
If any of us talk to any grownups,
he's gonna get very, very angry,

00:22.689 --> 00:24.065
Who? The Gargoyle King?

00:24.190 --> 00:25.358
[snarling]

00:25.442 --> 00:28.111
-She's having a seizure.
-Ethel. Help is coming, okay?

00:28.194 --> 00:30.822
We both flipped the coin.
He was scared to ascend.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.615
But I'm not. Soon you'll fly, too.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.743
-[Jughead] Ben, no! Ben!
-[Betty] Ben!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.536
I'm Evelyn. You're Betty Cooper?

00:36.619 --> 00:38.747
Your mom and your sister
study with my dad.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.582
-From the Farm?
-Yeah, that's right.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.624
Edgar Evernever.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.918
I won't tell anyone about the other night.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.420
Oh, my God. Betty.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.796
Stop the riot.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.840
[Norton] You impressed me today.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.468
You've been tapped.
You're gonna be my new Mad Dog.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.846
[door opens]

00:57.724 --> 00:58.892
[footsteps approaching]

01:04.439 --> 01:05.648
Well?

01:06.357 --> 01:07.400
Had time to think?

01:07.817 --> 01:08.985
The answer is still no.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.196
Then I'll see you in another week.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.540
This feels right, doesn't it?

01:23.833 --> 01:29.005
I'm glad the Farm, uh, opened you up
to the possibility of us.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.299
[chuckles]

01:36.679 --> 01:38.431
What are you thinking about, Alice?

01:38.515 --> 01:39.891
It's been three weeks.

01:40.642 --> 01:44.187
No more suicides, no more blue lips.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.856
As far as the town's concerned,

01:46.940 --> 01:49.234
it was just two boys
taking their own lives

01:49.317 --> 01:50.318
for whatever reason.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.238
Hopefully it ends there.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.534
With Jughead and Betty on the case?

01:59.327 --> 02:00.703
You know that's not likely.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.124
Betty, what are you thinking about?

02:05.416 --> 02:06.835
Do you think it's sort of...

02:08.461 --> 02:12.132
ghoulish for us
to be crashing Dilton's bunker like this?

02:12.423 --> 02:15.885
This bunker is the only place in town
we can get a modicum of privacy.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.264
-My dad's watching me like a hawk.
-Same with my mom.

02:24.018 --> 02:27.021
Ben's death haunts me, Jug.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.316
He didn't scream.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.903
Why not, I wonder.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.699
Because that's one of the rules
of Gryphons and Gargoyles?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.244
Betty, that's what we're missing.

02:41.619 --> 02:45.582
There's no rulebook, no player's manual.
What if that's the key to all this?

02:45.665 --> 02:48.501
Ethel, Ben, and Dilton talk about it
like a religion.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.961
Yeah, or a cult.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.922
And every cult has its king.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.218
Sorry I kept you waiting, Mr. Andrews.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.179
How can I help you? My son.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.808
I wanna see him.

03:03.892 --> 03:04.934
Today.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.770
Your son is quite a firebrand.

03:08.771 --> 03:09.898
He started a riot.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.525
I'm afraid
his visitation privileges are suspended.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.778
I was told by witnesses
that your guards started that riot.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.448
That's a very serious accusation,
Mr. Andrews.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.866
It's been three weeks.

03:19.949 --> 03:23.828
I will decide when it is appropriate
for him to receive visitors again.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.123
Was there anything else?

03:28.499 --> 03:29.334
Yeah.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.378
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.465
[Veronica] <i>I'm in trouble here, Bee.</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:38.176
I'm up to my eyebrows in bills.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.886
Pop's is hemorrhaging money.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.846
Well, how far along is the speakeasy?

03:41.930 --> 03:43.056
Is it close, at least?

03:45.516 --> 03:46.351
Vee, what?

03:46.684 --> 03:47.518
What is it?

03:50.647 --> 03:51.856
The speakeasy's ready.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.985
-It has been for a while.
-What? Why haven't you opened it?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.238
I've been waiting for Archie.

03:59.113 --> 03:59.948
I just...

04:01.699 --> 04:05.203
I wanted him to be there,
dancing with me on opening night.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.287
A part of it all.

04:09.123 --> 04:12.210
This is exactly what Archie didn't want.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.796
For you to just put your life on hold.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.132
You need to focus on yourself
for a change.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.760
I'm saying this to you as your friend.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.595
Open the damn speakeasy.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.268
Veronica says
she'll have a pretty strict dress code

04:28.351 --> 04:31.271
-at her speakeasy.
-Of course we're calling it a speakeasy.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.856
And, uh, what are you getting at?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.486
Hey, Ethel's back.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.656
Yeah, she's talking
to that weirdo girl from the Farm.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.659
Oh, my God.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.371
What if the game is connected to the Farm?

04:49.580 --> 04:52.542
Ben, Dilton, and Ethel
started playing the game this summer,

04:52.625 --> 04:56.129
which is when the Farm
and the Evernevers moved to Riverdale.

04:56.212 --> 05:00.174
Evelyn's dad, Edgar, is their leader.
My mom won't stop talking about him.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.718
-He's like a kind of--
-King?

05:04.012 --> 05:07.307
-What do you know about him and the Farm?
-Basically nothing.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.270
-Should we start with Evelyn or Ethel?
-Ethel.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.565
Evelyn... creeps me out.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.484
Last time we talked to Ethel,
she had a seizure.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.279
We'll be more gentle this time.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.114
[Josie] <i>Hi, Pop.</i>

05:23.197 --> 05:25.325
Looking for Veronica? This way.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.204
Pick up the phone, dial 642.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.712
[phone line dialing] -[Reggie] <i>Password.</i>
-I don't know.

05:40.048 --> 05:40.882
Stonewall.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.177
[Reggie] Close enough. Whoa.

05:49.724 --> 05:50.808
[Josie chuckles]

05:50.892 --> 05:53.311
-Come on in.
-[Josie] Oh, my God.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.691
Oh, my God.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.319
I died and went to Kander and Ebb heaven.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.237
Veronica.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.572
Welcome to La Bonne Nuit.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.535
I hired some Serpents from the Whyte Wyrm
to serve drinks. Mocktails only.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.413
La Bonne Nuit is not in the business
of corrupting minors.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.748
Not yet.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.541
Josie.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.126
I need star power.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.296
I would love for you
to be my resident chanteuse.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.297
Are you for real?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.215
Mm-hm.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.802
I have been working like whoa
to find my sound now that I'm solo,

06:25.885 --> 06:28.012
and I haven't had anywhere to test it out.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.724
Ooh, this is the perfect opportunity.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.936
And, Kevin,
I'd love for you to be our emcee.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.021
So long as I can sing now and then.

06:37.688 --> 06:38.689
But of course.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.692
Or as we like to say at La Bonne Nuit,
<i>mais oui.</i>

06:42.443 --> 06:43.611
[phone rings]

06:45.405 --> 06:46.447
Hey, Pop. What's up?

06:50.868 --> 06:51.953
[Veronica] <i>Penny Peabody.</i>

06:52.412 --> 06:55.915
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Now, what the hell do you want?

06:55.998 --> 06:59.210
[chuckles] No, no, no.
It's not what I want.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.671
It's what you want.

07:02.088 --> 07:02.922
Protection.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.883
The Ghoulies are offering
their services...

07:06.676 --> 07:07.718
for a modest price.

07:08.886 --> 07:09.887
Let me guess.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.931
Protection from you, right?

07:13.182 --> 07:14.767
[Penny] It's a nice place you got here.

07:14.851 --> 07:19.397
And... as above, so below, I'm guessing.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.316
Maybe even nicer down there
in the speakeasy?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.277
I'd hate for something bad
to happen to it.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.279
Food for thought.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.326
I'll let you chew on it.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.840
Up and at 'em. We're going for a ride.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.096
[boys grunting]

07:56.017 --> 07:57.018
Welcome to the Pit.

08:05.151 --> 08:05.985
Joaquin.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.613
When you refused my offer,
I tapped a replacement.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.948
I knew you were friends with Mr. DeSantos.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.994
As you can see, he's nearly reached
the end of his... usefulness.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.372
Only you, Mr. Andrews,
can decide how he ends it.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.374
Back in his cell, safe and sound.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.752
Or in the infirmary on life support.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.929
I'll do it. I'll take his place.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.348
[crowd cheering]

08:45.733 --> 08:47.026
[security alarm buzzes]

08:50.821 --> 08:52.615
Andrews, meet the rest of the team.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.082
The name's Baby Teeth.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.584
May not look like much,
but I leave a mark.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.545
That's Thumper,

09:05.628 --> 09:06.462
and Peter. Archie.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.927
You better start hitting this bag,
before the captain comes over.

09:18.057 --> 09:18.891
Rules of the fight:

09:18.975 --> 09:20.393
Bare knuckles till knockout.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.103
Warden sells the tickets.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.312
Guards place bets.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.605
Everyone profits.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.148
Except us.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.150
Get perks if we win.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.988
What happened to Mad Dog?

09:33.781 --> 09:34.782
Quit the chatter.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.327
Best you don't ask many questions.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.626
Just the ladies I was looking for.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.045
President Blossom, First Lady Topaz.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.840
I need help spreading the good word
about my speakeasy.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.968
-Go on.
-In exchange for promoting La Bonne Nuit,

09:54.051 --> 09:57.430
I'm offering you no cover
and free drinks all night. Mm-hm.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.058
[Cheryl] Well, well, well.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.186
Heavy card stock, and valet parking.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.147
You don't take the subway to the Met Gala.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.898
Hand them out at your discretion.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.776
And Sweet Pea and Fangs
should be in attendance.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.156
Hmm.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.164
Ethel. Hi.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.918
Are you eating alone? Do you mind if we--?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.672
The doctors put me on medication.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.382
To stop the seizures.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.386
I was having them multiple times a day.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.888
It's very strong.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.892
Look, if Betty and I did something
to trigger your seizures, we're sorry.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.435
We were trying to help.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.022
Like you tried to help my boyfriend, Ben,
when he threw himself out a window?

10:49.649 --> 10:50.483
Ethel...

10:52.401 --> 10:55.363
when you collapsed,
did you have any visions?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.616
I honestly don't remember.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.159
Okay.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.997
Well, how long have you been friends
with Evelyn Evernever?

11:05.623 --> 11:06.832
Evelyn's the best.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.752
She visited me in the hospital,
is helping me get better,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.838
-so I can titrate down my meds.
-Was that her idea or her dad's?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.591
Wait, have you met Mr. Evernever?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.636
If you're so curious,
check out Evelyn's peer support group.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.763
Weatherbee gave her permission

11:20.846 --> 11:23.015
to start a student chapter
of the Farm here.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.602
[school bell ringing]

11:29.522 --> 11:30.356
Ethel?

11:32.858 --> 11:34.276
Before Ben...

11:36.195 --> 11:37.154
Uh...

11:38.072 --> 11:40.533
He mentioned reuniting with Dilton
in the Kingdom.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.867
You know what that means?

11:43.119 --> 11:44.954
Two people died,
playing Gryphons and Gargoyles.

11:45.037 --> 11:45.871
G&amp;G.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.249
We have no idea why.
This is a crazy question.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.876
Do you have a rulebook
or a player's manual?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.295
You mean the scripture?

11:53.379 --> 11:54.714
Yes. That.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.048
Do you own a copy?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.342
I can't just tell you that, obviously.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.928
Please? Princess Etheline.

12:01.011 --> 12:04.014
Don't call me that.
You haven't earned that privilege.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.725
You're not worthy of the King's scripture.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.017
Yes, but I wanna be.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.563
I wanna be worthy.
Could you please show me how?

12:15.651 --> 12:17.778
Meet me tomorrow night at Dilton's bunker.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.656
But... just you.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.494
Sorry, Betty, but you'll never be worthy,
no matter how hard you try.

12:33.627 --> 12:37.089
Well...
looks like you're on Ethel Muggs detail.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.175
And I...

12:39.800 --> 12:43.220
am in need of some serious peer support.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.685
These were upstairs for you.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.355
Hopefully it's the last of the deliveries.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.858
Excellent. Thank you, Reginald.

Dude... this is a serious stash
of jingle-jangle.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.875
Yes, but it's not mine. I don't know how--

13:12.958 --> 13:14.126
[phone ringing]

13:20.758 --> 13:21.759
Hey, Pop. What's up?

13:23.469 --> 13:25.054
Sheriff Minetta's upstairs?

13:25.805 --> 13:26.806
We have been set up.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.808
I can't get caught with this.
Mom would kill me.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.478
Um, tell him I'll be right up.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.023
I'll stall, but get rid of it. Now.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.989
What can I do
for Riverdale's finest today?

13:44.448 --> 13:47.785
-I'm here to do an inspection.
-We've had all our inspections.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.830
Except mine. Do you wanna show me around?

14:04.301 --> 14:05.261
What's up, sheriff?

14:11.308 --> 14:12.768
Looking for something in particular?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.229
[Minetta sighs]

14:15.521 --> 14:16.397
Anything illegal.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.149

14:19.775 --> 14:21.110
I'm collecting donations.

14:24.154 --> 14:24.989
That's right.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.660
Mm.

I see.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.623
This isn't a shakedown?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.544

14:38.627 --> 14:41.130

to collect after your opening event.

Think it's coincidence
they both work for your dad?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.026
Of course not, Reggie.

15:02.318 --> 15:06.405
My father's clearly trying to bait me
into some kind of... confrontation.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.698
But I'm not going there.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.077

15:35.476 --> 15:36.685
What are you doing here?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.439
Well, I came to learn more about the Farm.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.690
Am I early?

15:42.483 --> 15:45.778
No. No, the Farm just needs some time
to catch on.

-Yeah.
-But it will.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.288
I also came here to talk to you
about Ethel Muggs.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.416
She said that you're helping her
with her seizures.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.168
Trying to.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.128
Yeah, with my dad's teachings.

16:03.253 --> 16:06.090
I just... have to get her off
that darn medication.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.469
-Wait, you're not taking any, are you?
-No, no. I'm not.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.054
I am considering it.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.807
Um, I'm still having convulsions.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.517
How often are they happening?

16:17.393 --> 16:19.061
Once or twice, daily.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.856
I was hoping that your dad could help.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.652

18:28.357 --> 18:29.817
But how can we help?

18:31.151 --> 18:33.195
Penny Peabody paid me a visit.

For instance, we know that over the summer

18:55.384 --> 18:57.845
the Ghoulies set up shop

that made Ben and Dilton kill themselves,

called the Gargoyle King,

26:42.100 --> 26:44.561
I told him.
I told him that you were worthy enough

26:44.644 --> 26:46.062
-to spread his gospel.
-Who?

26:46.730 --> 26:47.731
Don't be dumb.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.566
The King, of course.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.111
The King isn't going to
hurt anyone anymore.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.489
I'll make sure this doesn't
end up in anyone else's hands.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.407
Okay?

27:00.702 --> 27:02.120
Thank you, Hellcaster,

27:02.537 --> 27:04.039
for helping me finish my game.

27:09.461 --> 27:13.882
All right, Daddy. Cards on the table.
I'm not paying protection money to anyone.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.717
Not Penny, not Minetta,

27:15.800 --> 27:17.844
-and especially not to you.
-Veronica.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.765
A bit of advice,
from one entrepreneur to another:

27:22.724 --> 27:25.101
Don't make enemies
of people trying to help you.

27:25.935 --> 27:26.770
Help me? Okay.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.148
Here's the deal.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.692
You tell your lackeys to back off,

27:32.776 --> 27:36.071
or I'll send these photographs
of your drug lab to the authorities

27:36.154 --> 27:38.031
faster than you can say Heisenberg.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.451
Hmm.

27:42.535 --> 27:45.080
I doubt these will have much traction
with Minetta.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.998
[chuckles] I won't go to Minetta.

27:47.374 --> 27:48.375
I'll go to the FBI.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.712
Oh, and also,
I want $10,000 a week in perpetuity.

27:53.546 --> 27:56.216
That's right, Daddy. I'm shaking you down.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.844
You can keep those, by the way.
I have copies.

in Seaside.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.813
But I'll be back for your next match.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.150
Which is what I want to talk to you about.

28:17.904 --> 28:22.158
Ending a fight in a single punch
is not entertaining enough.

28:22.992 --> 28:25.161
Tonight,
your opponent should be no trouble.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.371
Punish him.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.831
Give us a show. And savor it.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.295
Make it last,
oh, five or six rounds, at least.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.340
That should fully sate
the crowd's bloodlust.

28:38.049 --> 28:38.883
And mine. Understood?

28:45.140 --> 28:45.974
Yes, sir.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.026
I thought being here...

28:57.736 --> 28:59.446
I'd pay for everything that I did.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.616
But what the warden wants me to do,
to become...

29:06.035 --> 29:07.036
is so much worse.

29:08.329 --> 29:12.125
When you were little,
I used to get calls from your school.

29:12.542 --> 29:16.421
Telling me that you had been in a fight,
usually protecting someone.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.048
The warden wants six rounds, Dad.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.718
He wants blood.
There's nothing that I can do.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.138
Your seventh-grade teacher told me
one thing's for sure.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.391
"By the time Archie gets out
of junior high school,

29:28.641 --> 29:31.978
he's gonna know how to throw a punch,
and how to take one."

29:33.396 --> 29:36.232
There are other ways of putting on a show
for the warden.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.485
Figure it out, son.

I won't miss it.

29:52.373 --> 29:55.460
You never had any intention
of working with the Farm, did you?

29:56.461 --> 30:00.089
You wanted to meet Edgar
so that you could attack him, I suppose?

30:00.173 --> 30:03.885
You realize, Mom, that by telling them
your deepest, darkest secrets,

30:03.968 --> 30:05.345
like about the shady man,

30:05.428 --> 30:07.430
you're also implicating me,

30:07.514 --> 30:08.681
and FP,

30:08.765 --> 30:09.849
and Jughead.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.143
They would never use
my testimony against me.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.061
Mom...

30:14.270 --> 30:16.856
what do you know
about Gryphons and Gargoyles, huh?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.192
What did you tell the Farm?

30:19.275 --> 30:21.653
We can't let ourselves
be strangled by our past.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.905
So, you're just gonna tell them,
but not me?

30:25.156 --> 30:26.282
Not your own daughter?

30:26.991 --> 30:29.118
I trust them more than I trust you, Betty.
