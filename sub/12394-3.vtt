WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:03.027
- THAT'S THE HIGHWAY
DEPARTMENT'S PROBLEM, JERRY,

00:03.070 --> 00:06.198
NOT MINE.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.459
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.398
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE
YOU THREE DOING HERE?

00:11.440 --> 00:12.532
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE IN SCHOOL?

00:12.580 --> 00:13.501
- YEAH, WELL, WE CAME
TO SEE THAT UFO

00:13.540 --> 00:15.474
YOU CLEARED FROM THAT FIELD
THIS MORNING.

00:15.510 --> 00:17.774
- YOU MEAN THE WEATHER BALLOON.
- THEY GOT TO HIM.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.414
- WHO GOT TO ME, DENNIS?

00:19.450 --> 00:21.145
- THE SECRET GOVERNMENT
AGENCY

00:21.180 --> 00:23.387
IN CHARGE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL
COVER-UPS.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.308
[slams desk]
- HOW MUCH ARE THEY PAYING YOU?

00:25.350 --> 00:26.351
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH, GUYS.

00:26.390 --> 00:29.154
BACK TO SCHOOL NOW.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.226
- DO YOU THINK THIS IS
A GAME, MR. SPENCER?

00:31.260 --> 00:32.192
- I ASSURE YOU, IT'S NOT.

00:32.230 --> 00:35.097
INSIDE THAT GROUNDED
CASSIOPEIAN DEATH POD

00:35.130 --> 00:37.564
SITS AN ARMY OF GLORNOKIAN
MERCENARIES

00:37.600 --> 00:39.261
INTENT ON COLONIZING
OUR PLANET

00:39.300 --> 00:41.359
AND PROPAGATING
THEIR EVIL SPECIES.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.504
- AFI'ER THEY PROBE US.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.833
WE SHOULD GO. HE'S PACKING.
- YEAH.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.678
- THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS
AS UFOs, SHAWN.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.719
- SO THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED
TO COMPENSATORY

01:01.760 --> 01:06.424
AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
PER ARTICLE 35-A, SECTION "J,"

01:06.460 --> 01:09.463
WHICH STIP--WHICH, UH...
[loud mechanized humming]

01:29.820 --> 01:32.550
[violent shaking]

01:36.360 --> 01:39.397
[Ioud, deep hum]

01:44.470 --> 01:47.337
OH, JESUS! TOBY!

01:47.370 --> 01:49.634
- HEY, ROY.
ARE YOU--ARE YOU OKAY?

01:49.670 --> 01:53.800
JUST CAME BY TO DROP OFF
THE PATTERSON FILE...

01:53.840 --> 01:55.774
AND SOME REFILLS.

01:55.810 --> 01:57.778
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

01:57.810 --> 02:01.678
UM, LISTEN, DID YOU NOTICE
ANY COMMOTION A MOMENT AGO?

02:01.720 --> 02:03.711
- NO. NO.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.445
WHAT KIND OF COMMOTION
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

03:08.950 --> 03:12.283
- TOBY. TOBY!

03:12.320 --> 03:14.379
TOBY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TOBY, NO!

03:58.070 --> 03:59.992
- AREN'T YOU FORGE'I'I'ING
SOMETHING?

04:00.040 --> 04:04.534
- NO.
- HEY! HEY!

04:04.570 --> 04:06.037
- CHIEF SAID WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO LET HIM

04:06.070 --> 04:07.537
DRIVE AROUND WITH US,
GET TO KNOW OUR PROCESS.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.638
WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY DRIVING.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.875
YOU NEED TO STOP TAKING
YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH SHAWN

04:10.910 --> 04:12.002
OUT ON HENRY.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.870
BETI'ER HIM THAN
THE NEIGHBOR'S CAT.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.487
- OW.

04:19.590 --> 04:22.388
I--I COULD HAVE SUFFOCATED
IN THERE!

04:22.430 --> 04:23.886
- JEEZ, I CRACKED
THE WINDOW.

04:23.930 --> 04:24.988
- I'M GLAD THAT SHAWN
PEANUT-BU'I'I'ERED YOUR PHONE

04:25.030 --> 04:25.985
THE OTHER DAY.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.520
- I KNEW THAT WAS HIM.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.018
- GUYS!
- I STILL HAVE JIF IN MY EAR.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.436
- MR. KESSLER,
I AM DETECTIVE O'HARA,

04:33.470 --> 04:35.358
AND THIS IS DETECTIVE LASSITER,
AND THIS IS HENRY SPENCER,

04:35.400 --> 04:38.369
WHO HELPS US COORDINATE
OUR INVESTIGATIONS.

04:38.410 --> 04:39.877
- SO, SIR, I UNDERSTAND

04:39.910 --> 04:41.605
YOU WITNESSED A KIDNAPPING
LAST NIGHT.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.540
- I'D SAY IT WAS MORE
OF AN ABDUCT ION.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.343
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO THE PERPETRATOR WAS?

04:45.380 --> 04:48.042
- YES!
AN EXT RATERRESTRIAL.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.412
- HOW COME THE CRAZIES
NEVER LIVE CLOSE BY?

04:50.450 --> 04:51.678
- LISTEN, I KNOW
IT SOUNDS NUTS,

04:51.720 --> 04:52.982
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.

04:53.020 --> 04:56.524
AN ALIEN CAME DOWN
AND SNATCHED A YOUNG LAWYER

04:56.560 --> 04:57.857
THAT WORKS AT MY FIRM--
TOBY SHORE.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.323
- MR. KESSLER, NO OFFENSE,

04:59.360 --> 05:01.089
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A HARD TIME

05:01.130 --> 05:02.722
FINDING ANYONE TO BELIEVE
A STORY LIKE THAT.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.998
- WAS HE TALL AND SCALY,

05:04.030 --> 05:05.861
OR SHORT, WITH A HUGE
LOLLIPOP HEAD?

05:05.900 --> 05:07.367
- TALL, I THINK.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.936
- REPTILIAN.
- PROBABLY HOSTILE.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.904
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, WE'RE GONNA
NEED A SPEAK & SPELL

05:10.940 --> 05:12.032
AND SEVEN POUNDS
OF MASHED POTATOES.

05:12.070 --> 05:13.503
- ENOUGH!

05:13.540 --> 05:14.700
MR. KESSLER, IF YOUR CO-WORKER
DOESN'T SHOW UP

05:14.740 --> 05:16.071
IN THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS,

05:16.110 --> 05:19.045
FEEL FREE TO FILE
A MISSING PERSONS REPORT.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.911
UNTIL THEN,
STOP WASTING OUR TIME.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.542
YOU OWE ME A NEW PHONE!

05:26.860 --> 05:29.954
- YOU HAVE A VERY NICE HOME.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.754
- THIS UFO, WAS IT MORE LIKE
A BRIGHT SPHERE,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.950
OR TWO SOUP BOWLS
GLUED TOGETHER?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.094
- NO, IT WAS A SPHERE,
DEFINITELY.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.836
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS?
ARE YOU UFO CHASERS?

05:39.870 --> 05:43.431
- NOTHING AS RIDICULOUS AS THAT.
WE'RE PSYCHIC DETECT IVES.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.960
- AND WE CAN HELP YOU
GET TO THE BOTTOM

05:45.010 --> 05:48.434
OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.
- AH, FANTASTIC. YOU'RE HIRED.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.744
- SHAWN!
MAY I HAVE A WORD?

05:50.780 --> 05:52.975
- EXCUSE US.

05:53.020 --> 05:57.116
- I--I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CASE.

05:57.150 --> 05:57.787
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE DROPPING THE DIME

05:57.820 --> 05:59.515
ON MY PEANUT BUTTER PRANKS.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.016
- LOOK, WE ALL KNOW
THERE'S 0% CHANCE

06:01.060 --> 06:02.789
THAT YOU DON'T END UP
BELIEVING THIS KOOK.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.728
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

06:03.760 --> 06:05.387
- BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO BELIEVE HIM, SHAWN.

06:05.430 --> 06:06.727
JUST LIKE YOU WANTED
TO BELIEVE

06:06.760 --> 06:08.751
IT WASN'T A WEATHER BALLOON
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

06:08.800 --> 06:09.767
AND YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT IT WAS ALIENS

06:09.800 --> 06:11.097
THAT ABDUCT ED JOE PISCOPO.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.768
- THAT REMAINS MY THEORY
UNTIL SOMEONE CAN

06:12.800 --> 06:13.994
PINPOINT THE MAN'S WHEREABOUTS.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.735
- DON'T WORRY, MR. SPENCER,
I PROMISE YOU

06:15.770 --> 06:17.863
WE WILL NOT LET OUR INTEREST
IN UFOS AFFECT OUR JUDGMENT.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.003
- GOOD. 'CAUSE YOU
RUN AROUND TOWN

06:20.040 --> 06:21.974
TELLING EVERYBODY
THAT AN ALIEN DID THIS,

06:22.010 --> 06:24.501
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE
A COUPLE OF NUT JOBS.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.848
SHAWN,
I CAN'T HIRE NUT JOBS.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.074
- DAD, WOULD YOU RELAX,
PLEASE?

06:28.120 --> 06:30.884
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T THINK
ALIENS ARE RESPONSIBLE.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.456
- GOOD.
[horn honks]

06:32.490 --> 06:36.017
HOLD YOUR HORSES!

06:38.790 --> 06:42.419
- BECAUSE IF ALIENS DID
DO THIS,

06:42.470 --> 06:44.165
THERE'D BE SIGNS
OF ELECTRICAL DISRUPTIONS.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.864
- [chuckles]
EXACTLY!

06:48.900 --> 06:50.504
WHAT ELSE WOULD WE SEE, GUS?

06:50.540 --> 06:51.768
- WELL, THERE WOULD
MOST DEFINITELY BE

06:51.810 --> 06:53.971
A VISIBLE GROUND DISTURBANCE.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.073
- RIGHT.

06:58.110 --> 07:00.078
- SO WHERE DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO START?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.839
- HOW 'BOUT YOUR TERRACE?

07:07.960 --> 07:11.020
WHOA.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.982
- ALL THOSE PEOPLE
WHO GAVE YOU, DENNIS, AND I FLAK

07:42.020 --> 07:44.181
FOR BELIEVING IN ALIENS
IN SCHOOL--

07:44.230 --> 07:46.790
JEFF GARRETT, AND THAT
FEMALE RUSSIAN EXCHANGE STUDENT

07:46.830 --> 07:48.195
WHO STOLE MY WALLET--

07:48.230 --> 07:49.891
THEY'RE GONNA EAT THEIR WORDS
WHEN THIS GOES PUBLIC.

07:49.930 --> 07:51.192
- I'VE GOT NEWS, GUS.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.130
TOBY SHORE WAS NOT ABDUCTED
BY AN ALIEN.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.968
- WHAT? BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE LIGHTS AND GRASS AND STUFF?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.662
- IT'S TIME WE LEARNED
IT'S NEVER THE CRAZY SUSPECT.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.234
IT WASN'T A MUMMY.
IT WASN'T THE DEVIL.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.577
IT WASN'T EVEN BIGFOOT.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.907
- BIGFOOT?
WHEN DID WE SUSPECT BIGFOOT?

08:02.950 --> 08:04.247
- MISSING SCHOOL BUS CASE.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.043
REMEMBER, THERE WERE
BITE MARKS IN CUSHION.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.139
THE DRIVER'S SEAT WAS
PUSHED BACK SIX FEET.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.819
- OKAY, OKAY, YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT AN ALIEN,

08:10.850 --> 08:13.159
BUT WHY DON'T WE KEEP
INVESTIGATING JUST TO BE SURE.

08:13.190 --> 08:15.658
- BECAUSE MY DAD ACTUALLY MAKES
A VALID POINT.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.726
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO GET
ANY OBJECTIVE WORK DONE

08:17.760 --> 08:19.751
WHEN WE'RE BOTH SECRETLY HOPING
THAT IT'S AN ALIEN.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.722
- SO WE CAN RUB IT
IN JEFF GARRE'IT'S FACE.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.125
- NO, GUS, WE HAVE TO
LET THAT GO.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.228
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT WE PASS ON THE CASE?

08:24.270 --> 08:27.569
- NO. YOU'RE $1,200 BALANCE
ON YOUR J.C. PENNY CARD

08:27.600 --> 08:29.067
IS NOT GONNA PAY
FOR ITSELF.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.933
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE
OUR MUTUAL TENDENCY

08:31.970 --> 08:33.676
TO THINK UNREASONABLY
ABOUT THIS TOPIC,

08:33.710 --> 08:35.632
POLICE OURSELVES ACCORDINGLY.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.001
- HOW?
- ALL RIGHT...

08:38.050 --> 08:40.177
IF ONE OF US STARTS LEANING
TOWARDS THE ALIEN THEORY,

08:40.220 --> 08:41.949
OTHER ONE GETS TO
FLICK HIM IN THE EAR.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.686
- THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY
STUPID IDEA.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.085
- YOU HAVE EXACTLY THREE SECONDS
TO BEAT IT.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.179
TH REE, TWO, ONE--
PBBBT!

08:47.220 --> 08:50.656
- NOW, HOW IS THAT FAIR?

08:50.690 --> 08:54.228
- NOW, LET'S FIND OUT WHAT,
IF ANYTHING,

08:54.260 --> 08:57.161
HAPPENED HERE LAST NIGHT.

08:59.170 --> 09:01.138
ROY?
MAY I CALL YOU PHIL?

09:01.170 --> 09:02.899
- I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.567
- FAIR ENOUGH.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.736
HOW MANY BEERS
DID YOU HAVE LAST NIGHT?

09:05.770 --> 09:09.206
- JUST ONE.
AW, COME ON, WHAT--

09:09.240 --> 09:11.743
ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT I
BEER-GOGGLED AN ALIEN ABDUCT ION?

09:11.780 --> 09:13.179
- HAPPENED TO GUS
LAST NEW YEARS.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.346
- I HIT THE WHITE ZIN HARD.

09:14.380 --> 09:17.110
- I PROMISE YOU,
I WAS SOBER AS A JUDGE.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.618
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.615
IF TOBY WASN'T ABDUCTED
LAST NIGHT,

09:20.660 --> 09:21.786
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

09:21.820 --> 09:23.321
- MAYBE HE LEFI'
WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.328
- HIS CAR'S STILL
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.622
- AND LISTEN TO THIS.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.627
WHEN I WENT OUT
TO MOVE IT THIS MORNING,

09:27.660 --> 09:28.649
IT WOULDN'T START.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.918
THE CAR'S BRAND-NEW!
- REALLY?

09:30.970 --> 09:33.097
YOU KNOW, CARS OFTEN LOSE
BATTERY POWER

09:33.140 --> 09:37.338
WHEN THEY COME IN CONTACT
WITH UFOs--OW!

09:37.370 --> 09:39.770
THANK YOU.
HAVE YOU TRIED CALLING HIM?

09:39.810 --> 09:41.232
- YEAH.
ABOUT 50 TIMES.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.679
JUST GOES STRAIGHT
TO VOICE MAIL.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.598
- MAYBE HE'S OUT OF RANGE.
AAH!

09:44.650 --> 09:45.947
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT FOR?

09:45.980 --> 09:47.618
- YOU WERE IMPLYING
HE'S IN SPACE.

09:47.650 --> 09:51.108
- NO, I WASN'T.
- YES, YOU WERE.

09:51.150 --> 09:54.051
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:54.090 --> 09:56.217
MR. KESSLER, MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS

09:56.260 --> 09:57.227
TO SEE IF THEY SAW
ANYTHING.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.625
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.355
THE NEAREST ONE'S ABOUT
HALF A MILE AWAY.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.722
LISTEN, YOU GOTTA
BELIEVE ME.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.624
I WAS JUST SITTING
AT THE DESK LAST NIGHT,

10:05.670 --> 10:07.365
AND THE WHOLE HOUSE
STARTED TO SHAKE.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.190
AND THEN THIS--

10:09.240 --> 10:11.731
I WAS HEARING
THIS WEIRD SOUND.

10:11.770 --> 10:12.930
IT SOUNDED LIKE--

10:12.980 --> 10:17.679
- [a la Close Encounters...]
* ZONG...SHONG...BONG...

10:17.710 --> 10:19.007
* NAA...

10:19.050 --> 10:20.847
- NO, IT SOUNDED NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.643
- OH, REALLY. SORRY.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.988
I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING
TO MAKE THIS SOUND.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.659
[noises from night before]

10:27.690 --> 10:30.682
- THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT!
THAT'S THE SOUND.

10:30.730 --> 10:31.651
- YOU WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.419
- YOU KNOW I STRUGGLE
WITH TONE DEAFNESS.

10:33.460 --> 10:36.691
WHY WOULD YOU--
- NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

10:36.730 --> 10:38.925
- BEFORE WE ANSWER
THAT QUESTION,

10:38.970 --> 10:41.165
WE'LL NEED TO CONSULT
AN EXPERT.

10:50.810 --> 10:54.268
HI, WE'RE LOOKING FOR
DENNIS GOGOLACK.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.845
- SHAWN? GUS?

10:56.890 --> 10:58.687
- DENNIS?
- NO.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.312
- GET THE HELL OUT
OF HERE.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.749
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

11:02.790 --> 11:04.678
WHAT AN AWESOME SURPRISE!
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

11:04.730 --> 11:05.549
IT'S BEEN FOREVER!

11:05.590 --> 11:07.194
- WOW, WE DIDN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE YOU,

11:07.230 --> 11:08.424
NOW THAT YOU'RE...

11:08.460 --> 11:10.769
- WHAT, NOT FAT AND NERDY?
- WELL...

11:10.800 --> 11:11.698
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S THE TRUTH.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.937
I CREDIT MY PERSONAL TRAINER
AND LASIKS.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.460
- LOSING THE WIZARD'S CLOAK
ALSO HELPED.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.229
- COME ON,
GET INSIDE HERE!

11:20.080 --> 11:23.379
- WOW.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.469
- YEAH, MY WIFE'S INTO STUFF
THAT DANGLES.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.171
- LOOKS LIKE THE SOFTWARE
BUSINESS

11:27.220 --> 11:28.244
HAS BEEN GOOD TO YOU,
DENNIS.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.214
[footsteps on stairs]

11:32.250 --> 11:33.911
- VERY GOOD.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.724
- OH, HEY, GUYS.
I'M DENNIS' WIFE, MOLLY.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.422
- THAT WAS THE CREEPIEST "VERY"
THAT I'VE EVER HEARD.

11:39.460 --> 11:40.392
- HEY.
- HI.

11:40.430 --> 11:45.129
- BABE, THIS IS SHAWN
AND GUS.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.195
TWO GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE
FROM BACK IN GRADE SCHOOL.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.867
AND NOW THEY'RE
PSYCHIC DETECT IVES.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.367
HOW COOL IS THAT?
- REALLY COOL.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.502
NICE MEETING YOU GUYS.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.076
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT WE WERE

11:53.110 --> 11:54.202
HAVING FRIENDS OVER, DENNY?

11:54.240 --> 11:56.879
- ACTUALLY, WE DIDN'T
GIVE DENNY

11:56.910 --> 11:59.743
MUCH OF A HEADS UP.
HERE'S THE THING...

11:59.780 --> 12:01.509
WE'RE INVESTIGATING A CASE
THAT MAY HAVE INVOLVED

12:01.550 --> 12:02.983
AN ALIEN ABDUCT ION!

12:03.020 --> 12:05.181
- AND BEING THAT
YOUR HUSBAND IS

12:05.220 --> 12:07.484
ONE OF THE FOREMOST EXPERTS
ON THE TOPIC...

12:07.520 --> 12:11.479
- [nervous laughter]

12:11.530 --> 12:13.395
I'M--I'M SORRY, GUYS,
I'M AFRAID

12:13.430 --> 12:14.556
I'M NOT MUCH
OF AN EXPERT ANYMORE.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.388
PBBBT! IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS
SINCE I WAS INTO THAT STUFF.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.796
- OH, WELL, THAT'S--
SAME HERE, BRO, I MEAN--

12:20.840 --> 12:22.137
- BEER.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.536
- YEAH, DENNY IS
A TOTAL JOCK.

12:24.570 --> 12:27.107
- GUILTY.
I'M GUILTY AS CHARGED.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.903
- WOW.
- THEY DID, LIKE, A LITTLE..

12:28.940 --> 12:30.476
- EXPLOSION.
- YEAH.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.772
- BUT HEY, YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE OFF YET.

12:31.810 --> 12:32.777
WE'VE GOT SOME CATCHING UP
TO DO.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.776
- ACTUALLY, WE'RE UNDER
A BIT OF A TIME CRUNCH.

12:34.820 --> 12:35.912
- NO, NO, NO, LET ME JUST
GIVE YOU

12:35.950 --> 12:37.417
A QUICK TOUR OF THE PLACE.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.315
- DENNY, I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA GO
HANG WITH THE GIRLS, THOUGH.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.317
IS THAT OKAY?
- YEAH.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.089
- OKAY.
NICE MEETING YOU GUYS.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.985
- VERY NICE.
- STOP IT.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.453
- COME ON.
COME CHECK OUT MY OFFICE!

12:46.490 --> 12:48.492
- ALL RIGHT.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.564
I GOTTA SAY, DENNIS,
I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU,

12:54.600 --> 12:56.431
OF ALL PEOPLE,
OUTGREW THE WHOLE NERD THING.

12:56.470 --> 12:59.359
I MEAN, COME ON, YOU WERE
A CLASS-THREE DUNGEON MASTER

12:59.410 --> 13:00.934
WITH YOUR OWN SET OF CUSTOM
12-SIDED DICE.

13:00.980 --> 13:04.507
[door shuts]

13:13.920 --> 13:16.514
- LET'S GO.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.323
- WHAT...

13:19.490 --> 13:23.426
- OH, MY--
YOU ARE A CLOSET NERD!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.597
- LITERALLY.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.098
DUDE!

13:28.140 --> 13:29.368
WHAT?

13:29.400 --> 13:31.436
YOU HAVE A REPLICA
OF CAPTAIN ADAMA'S HELMET

13:31.470 --> 13:33.836
FROM THE ORIGINAL
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA?

13:33.880 --> 13:37.338
- AND LEVAR BURTON'S GLASSES
FROM STAR TREK?

13:37.380 --> 13:38.301
- THOSE AREN'T REPLICAS,
GENTLEMEN.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.148
I GOT THOSE FOR 15 GRAND A POP
AT AUCTION.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.341
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO MOTIVATED
TO MAKE MONEY.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.244
- WAIT TILL I SHOW YOU
WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

13:45.290 --> 13:46.416
AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.485
THERE'S ANOTHER HIDDEN ROOM
DOWNSTAIRS

13:47.520 --> 13:49.556
WHERE I PRACTICE
MY MAGIC TRICKS.

13:49.590 --> 13:51.228
- WHY ALL THE SECRECY?

13:51.260 --> 13:54.252
- WELL, LOOK,
WHEN I FIRST MET MOLLY,

13:54.300 --> 13:55.619
IT WAS CLEAR SHE WAS ONLY
INTO GUYS' GUYS.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.458
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
I PRETENDED TO BE.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.365
SHE ENDED UP BUYING IT.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.958
I GUESS I'VE BEEN PRETENDING
EVER SINCE.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.867
- SOUNDS EXHAUSTING.

14:04.910 --> 14:05.865
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.401
EVERY DAY IS
A NEW CHALLENGE.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.476
WHETHER IT'S TRYING
TO DRAW BLANKS DURING JEOPARDY,

14:10.510 --> 14:11.477
OR HAVING TO SNEAK IN HERE

14:11.510 --> 14:14.479
EVERY TIME I WANT TO TRACK
SOME UFO ACTIVITY

14:14.520 --> 14:16.112
OR SEW A NEW RENAISSANCE
FAIRE COSTUME.

14:16.150 --> 14:18.289
- EXCELLENT STITCH WORK,
MY LIEGE.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.652
- THANKS, GUS.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.510
THE WORST IS WHEN I'M AROUND
MOLLY'S FRIENDS' HUSBANDS.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.484
TO SAY INANE STUFF,
LIKE "BEER ME,"

14:25.530 --> 14:27.395
OR, "YEAH,
I'D TOTALLY HIT THAT."

14:27.430 --> 14:28.954
WHAT, EXACTLY,
AM I HITTING?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.467
- MOST LIKELY
AN ATTRACTIVE LADY.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.058
- OKAY, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.328
- IS IT REALLY WORTH IT,
DEN?

14:33.370 --> 14:34.564
- HAVE YOU SEEN MY WIFE?

14:34.600 --> 14:37.262
- LISTEN, DENNIS,
WE NEED YOUR OPINION

14:37.310 --> 14:38.265
ON THIS RECORDING.

14:38.310 --> 14:41.108
GUS IS CONVINCED
IT'S A UFO.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.573
- LET'S HEAR IT.

14:42.610 --> 14:47.115
[same recording as earlier]

14:47.150 --> 14:50.313
BASED ON MY RESEARCH,

14:50.350 --> 14:53.615
I'D SAY THAT'S A VOYAGER POD
FROM THE SERPENS DWARF GALAXY...

14:53.660 --> 14:56.254
OR...BAD NEW AGE MUSIC.

14:56.290 --> 14:57.587
- BUT IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE?

14:57.630 --> 15:00.451
- WAIT A SECOND.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.524
WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.462
IF YOU GUYS COULD GIVE ME
THE TIME AND LOCATION,

15:05.500 --> 15:06.592
I COULD CHECK
THE SKY ACTIVITY.

15:06.630 --> 15:09.337
I HACKED INTO THE NATIONAL
WEATHER SERVICE'S COMPUTER

15:09.370 --> 15:10.667
A FEW YEARS BACK, AND CAN
PRETTY MUCH ACCESS

15:10.710 --> 15:12.302
THEIR RADAR DATABASE
WHENEVER I WANT.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.035
- ALL RIGHT.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.002
WELL, HE LIVES AT
25 BUCKSKIN DRIVE.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.576
- AND IT HAPPENED AROUND
11:00 AT NIGHT.

15:23.650 --> 15:24.639
- NOTHING.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.510
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.224
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:34.260 --> 15:38.196
YOU BETTER TRY 10:44,
JUST TO BE SAFE.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.071
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

15:47.110 --> 15:50.409
W-WHAT IS--WHAT IS--
WHAT IS THAT?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.338
UH, DEN--

15:52.380 --> 15:53.540
- [wheezing]
- DENNIS...

15:53.580 --> 15:55.309
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE,
BUDDY?

15:55.350 --> 15:58.547
- [inhales]

15:58.590 --> 16:00.558
- SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ASTH MATIC?

16:00.590 --> 16:05.459
- NO.
AND SHE NEVER WILL.

16:05.490 --> 16:08.550
[sighs]

16:08.600 --> 16:11.023
- ALL RIGHT, GUS,

16:11.070 --> 16:12.594
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS.

16:12.630 --> 16:15.064
- WHAT?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.260
- I THINK TOBY GOT ABDUCTED.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.369
- SO DO I.
- YOU DO?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.229
- YES.
- SWEET.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.760
WHY ARE WE BOTH
COVERING OUR EARS, THEN?

16:19.810 --> 16:22.005
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.742
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.441
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT CALLING
JEFF GARRETT.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.641
- NO, ROY. HE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT WE BELIEVE HIM.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.250
- ALL RIGHT, BUT MAKE SURE YOU
TELL HIM TO KEEP IT ON THE QT.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.518
- I KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.448
- I'M STANDING HERE
JUST OUTSIDE THE HOME

16:36.490 --> 16:38.048
OF PROMINENT LOCAL ATTORNEY
ROY KESSLER,

16:38.090 --> 16:39.421
WHO'S JOINED ME NOW,

16:39.460 --> 16:41.519
AND HAS A RATHER SHOCKING
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.096
MR. KESSLER.

16:43.130 --> 16:46.520
- WELL, LAST NIGHT I WITNESSED
ALIENS ABDUCT

16:46.570 --> 16:47.332
A FELLOW CO-WORKER.

16:47.370 --> 16:48.735
- PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK
HE'S NUTS.

16:48.770 --> 16:50.067
- AND I CAN PROVE IT,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.600
THANKS TO THE FINE
INVESTIGATIVE WORK

16:51.640 --> 16:54.279
BEING DONE BY PSYCHIC DETECT IVES
SHAWN SPENCER

16:54.310 --> 16:57.302
AND...GURTON BUSTER.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.602
- GURTON WHAT?
- OH, MY GOD,

16:59.650 --> 17:01.572
I LOOK LIKE k.d. lang.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.541
[telephone rings]

17:02.580 --> 17:03.740
- WHAT KIND OF PROOF
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

17:03.790 --> 17:04.745
- WELL, I KNOW, I KNOW.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.041
IT DOES SOUND SHOCKING...

17:06.090 --> 17:09.457
- YES, DAD,
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

17:14.730 --> 17:17.699
BEFORE YOU GO OFF ON US,
ANSWER ME THIS QUESTION.

17:17.730 --> 17:20.096
DO YOU THINK THAT PICTURE OF ME
ON THE NEWS

17:20.140 --> 17:22.233
MAKES ME LOOK LIKE I SHOULD BE
SINGING CONSTANT CRAVING?

17:22.270 --> 17:24.261
- SHAWN, WHAT'D I TELL YOU
ABOUT TAKING THIS CASE?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.834
- MR. SPENCER, WE HAVE
HARD EVIDENCE ON THIS ONE.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.474
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT
THAT ROY KESSLER IS

17:27.510 --> 17:29.137
A RESPECT ED ATTORNEY,

17:29.180 --> 17:31.341
NOT SOME CRAZY
CONSPIRACY THEORIST.

17:31.380 --> 17:32.699
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE IS!

17:32.750 --> 17:35.514
SHAWN, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF BUDDING TEXTILES?

17:35.550 --> 17:37.142
- THAT'S THE COMPANY THAT HAD
TO FORK OUT MILLIONS

17:37.190 --> 17:38.316
FOR THE CHEMICAL SPILL.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.079
- UH-HUH. IT GOT
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SICK.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.350
AND YOU KNOW WHO THINKS
IT WAS DONE ON PURPOSE?

17:42.390 --> 17:44.449
- ERIN BROKOVICH.
- ROY KESSLER.

17:44.490 --> 17:47.254
HE'S PREPARING A LAWSUIT
AGAINST THEM.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.824
- WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.361
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE
YOU ALSO DIDN'T KNOW

17:50.400 --> 17:52.425
HE'S BEING HEAVILY MEDICATED
FOR ANXIETY.

17:52.470 --> 17:55.564
HE MISSES A DOSE, AND HE'S PRONE
TO PSYCHOTIC EPISODES.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.603
LAST YEAR, HE CLAIMS
TO HAVE SEEN A PANDA

17:58.640 --> 18:00.176
IN HIS COMPANY'S KITCHEN.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.407
- THAT'S NOT CRAZY AT ALL.
PANDAS ARE BIG EATERS.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.644
- TEN YEARS AGO,
KESSLER CLAIMED--

18:04.680 --> 18:06.102
YOU GOT IT--

18:06.150 --> 18:07.845
HE SAW A UFO
WHILE ON VACATION.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.575
- SAUCER OR SPHERE?

18:09.620 --> 18:10.814
- YOU KNOW, YOU TWO WOULDN'T
HAVE MISSED THIS KIND OF STUFF

18:10.850 --> 18:13.557
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SO BLINDED
BY YOUR CHILDISH INTERESTS,

18:13.590 --> 18:15.649
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THE ONLY THING

18:15.690 --> 18:17.487
WE WERE BLINDED BY IS...
- SCIENCE!

18:17.530 --> 18:18.349
- THAT NEVER GETS OLD
- NOPE.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.551
- TELL ME THIS--
IF TOBY WASN'T ABDUCTED,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.295
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

18:22.330 --> 18:23.558
- RIGHT IN THERE.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.364
- ...MORNING.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.459
- THIS MORNING.
- HE REALLY KIND OF...

18:28.500 --> 18:30.468
- HE TOOK A CAB TO HIS
PARENTS' HOUSE THAT NIGHT

18:30.510 --> 18:31.863
AI-TER HIS CAR WOULDN'T START.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.708
TURNED OFF HIS PHONE,
AND HE SLEPT IN.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.743
- [sighs]

18:37.780 --> 18:39.645
NICE GOING, MAN.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.545
- OW!
- OW!

18:41.580 --> 18:43.582
- OW!
- OW! UNH...

18:43.620 --> 18:46.509
- STOP!

18:53.430 --> 18:55.250
- I REMEMBER HIM MUTTERING
ALL THIS STUFF

18:55.300 --> 18:57.325
ABOUT LIGHTS AND SHIPS.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.565
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ROY
BEING ROY.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.897
AND THEN I TURNED ON
THE TV TODAY

19:00.940 --> 19:02.567
AND HEARD HIS INSANE THEORY.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.602
- I WOULDN'T CALL IT INSANE.
- WOULD YOU LET IT GO?

19:04.640 --> 19:07.700
- I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD
TO GET HIM TO TAKE HIS MEDS.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.537
I WOULD EVEN PICK THEM UP
AT THE PHARMACY FOR HIM

19:09.580 --> 19:11.775
AND BRING THEM TO HIM
DIRECTLY.

19:11.810 --> 19:14.449
MAN, HE'S GONNA HEAR IT
AT THE OFFICE ON MONDAY.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.242
- ACTUALLY, YOUR FIRM JUST
SUSPENDED HIM

19:15.280 --> 19:16.918
UNTIL HE COMPLETES
A MONTH'S STAY

19:16.950 --> 19:18.315
IN A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

19:18.350 --> 19:21.786
- WOW. WHO'S GONNA GET
ALL HIS CASES?

19:21.820 --> 19:23.378
- WE'RE AVAILABLE.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.920
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MR. SPENCER?

19:24.960 --> 19:27.929
GUS HERE IS A WHIZ
AT LEGAL ZOOM,

19:27.960 --> 19:29.450
AND MY COUSIN HAS
A PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRM

19:29.500 --> 19:31.388
CALLED ACCIDENTES.
HEARD OF IT?

19:31.430 --> 19:33.432
- NO, I HAVEN'T.
- YOU WILL. YOU WILL.

19:33.470 --> 19:36.735
- GOOD WORK, PEOPLE.
PAPA BEAR.

19:43.510 --> 19:46.479
- [laughing]

19:48.880 --> 19:50.416
- YOU KNOW WHAT, GUS,
I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE

19:50.450 --> 19:51.781
BEING SNICKERED AT.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.708
NEVER AGAIN ARE WE
INVESTIGATING SOMETHING

19:53.760 --> 19:55.557
RELATED TO ONE
OF OUR CHILDHOOD OBSESSIONS.

19:55.590 --> 19:56.887
- WHAT IF THERE'S
A POP ROCKS MURDER?

19:56.920 --> 19:58.228
- THAT IS THE EXCEPTION.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.228
- EXCUSE ME, SPENCER.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.558
QUICK QUESTION.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.227
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE SO WRONG

20:04.270 --> 20:06.568
THAT YOU ARE NOW...
A WALKING JOKE?

20:06.600 --> 20:09.489
- JUST LIKE YOU, MINUS THE
KIND BOOTS AND THE SOI-T EYES.

20:09.540 --> 20:13.476
- HA! WOW, THIS IS REALLY
A BIG MOMENT FOR ME.

20:13.510 --> 20:17.378
I MAY EVEN DO
A LITTLE DANCE.

20:17.410 --> 20:20.345
OH, YES, I WILL.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.540
* NO, HE DOESN'T CARE

20:21.580 --> 20:23.514
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT, GUS.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.313
WE ARE GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED,

20:25.350 --> 20:26.715
AND WE ARE GONNA CLEAR
OUR GOOD NAMES.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.479
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.589
IF YOU WERE AN UP AND COMER
AT A LAW FIRM,

20:29.620 --> 20:30.621
AND YOU WERE ABDUCTED
BY ALIENS--

20:30.660 --> 20:31.888
- BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.056
- WOULD YOU TELL ANYONE?

20:33.090 --> 20:35.627
I KNOW I WOULDN'T, BECAUSE
THEY WOULD THINK I WAS NUTS.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.264
- LIKE I DO RIGHT NOW.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.369
THAT DUDE WAS NOT ABDUCT ED,
GUS.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.539
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS

20:40.570 --> 20:42.561
TO COME UP WITH A BETTER THEORY
TO EXPLAIN ALL THIS WEIRDNESS.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.567
- ALL RIGHT.
- THREE, TWO, ONE...BZZZZ!

20:43.610 --> 20:44.963
- THAT'S MY TRICK.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.864
- HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE RADAR, THE RECORDING,

20:46.910 --> 20:48.332
THE INDENTATION
ON THE LAWN?

20:48.380 --> 20:50.029
- LET ME TELL YOU.
IT WAS A PLANE ON THE RADAR.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.048
SOMEONE CRANKING YANNI
ON THE RECORDER.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.775
AND THE INDENTATION COULD HAVE
BEEN A MILLION THINGS.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.469
- SHAWN, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE THREE STRANGE MARKINGS

20:55.520 --> 20:57.715
ON TOBY'S ARM?
- YOU SAW THOSE?

20:57.750 --> 20:58.739
- OF COURSE I DID.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.587
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.848
- ARE YOU MOCKING MY
"IT'S A CLUE" FACE?

21:01.890 --> 21:02.959
- YEP.
- DO IT AGAIN.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.322
I DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT.
- YES, YOU DO.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.588
- YOU'RE A BASTARD.

21:06.630 --> 21:07.699
- SHAWN, YOU KNOW THAT
ABDUCTEES OI-TEN HAVE

21:07.730 --> 21:08.697
STRANGE MARKINGS
ON THEIR SKIN.

21:08.730 --> 21:09.719
- SO DO I WHEN I DON'T USE

21:09.760 --> 21:11.762
ENOUGH SUNSCREEN--
NOW COME HERE.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.430
STAND STILL AND LET ME
FLICK YOUR EAR.

21:17.470 --> 21:18.459
- HE WAS ABDUCT ED, SHAWN.

21:18.510 --> 21:19.204
- WAS NOT.
- YES, HE WAS.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.502
- NO, HE WASN'T.
- YES, HE WAS.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.507
- WAS NOT. WASN'T.
- YES, HE WAS.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.474
- WASN'T INFINITY!

21:23.510 --> 21:25.000
IF YOU'RE GONNA ACT
LIKE A CHILD ABOUT THIS,

21:25.050 --> 21:26.472
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
BRING IN A THIRD PARTY

21:26.510 --> 21:28.068
TO SETTLE THIS DISAGREEMENT.
- FINE. WHO?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.644
- HE WAS DEFINITELY ABDUCTED.

21:29.680 --> 21:30.840
THE MARKINGS COMBINED WITH
THE OTHER DETAILS

21:30.890 --> 21:31.879
HAVE ME CONVINCED.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.353
- WHY WOULD I TAG IN A GUY

21:33.390 --> 21:34.948
WITH A CUSTOM-MADE
EWOK COSTUME?

21:34.990 --> 21:37.083
- HEY, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THAT LAW FIRM HE WORKS AT?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.724
- UH, WILCOX, KESSLER,
AND SOMETHING.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.728
- HOLD ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:40.760 --> 21:44.389
- GETTING HIS WORK ADDRESS
SO YOU CAN SPY ON THIS GUY.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.489
LOOK, FELLAS,
YOU HAVE TO SEE

21:46.530 --> 21:48.794
IF HE'S EXHIBITING THE OTHER
TELLTALE ABDUCT ION SIGNS.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.330
YOU KNOW THIS.
PARANOIA!

21:50.370 --> 21:52.065
THE COMPULSION TO TRAVEL
TO UNKNOWN AREAS.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.805
- SUICIDAL TENDENCIES.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.102
- SPEWING NONSENSE
WITH AUTHORITY.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.676
OH, WAIT, THAT'S YOU GUYS.

21:56.710 --> 21:58.371
- YOU MOCK,
BUT I'M STILL WAITING

21:58.410 --> 22:00.446
ON A BETTER THEORY
FROM YOU.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.613
- ALL RIGHT.
IT WAS TOBY.

22:09.660 --> 22:13.357
- WHY DID HE JUST
TILT HIS HEAD AND SQUINT?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.799
- IT'S HIS
"I GOT A CLUE" FACE.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.354
- THINK ABOUT IT, "GUST."

22:16.400 --> 22:18.129
TOBY KNEW HE STOOD TO INHERIT
ALL OF ROY'S CASES

22:18.170 --> 22:19.626
IF HE COULD JUST
GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY.

22:19.670 --> 22:21.137
SO HE ARRANGED FOR HIM
TO HAVE ONE OF HIS

22:21.170 --> 22:22.137
PSYCHOTIC EPISODES.

22:22.170 --> 22:23.194
- HOW?

22:23.240 --> 22:27.404
- I WOULD EVEN PICK THE MEDS UP
FROM THE PHARMACY

22:27.440 --> 22:28.873
AND BRING THEM TO HIM DIRECTLY.

22:28.910 --> 22:30.707
- BY TAMPERING WITH HIS MEDS.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.469
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.408
ROY GOES NUTS.
THE NEXT DAY,

22:35.450 --> 22:37.509
TOBY'S A MAJOR PLAYER
AT THE FIRM.

22:37.550 --> 22:39.086
LET'S GO.
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

22:39.120 --> 22:40.951
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA TAKE
DENNIS' ADVICE,

22:40.990 --> 22:42.582
DO A LITTLE SPYING
ON OUR BOY.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.679
- WHAT CAN I DO?

22:44.730 --> 22:46.925
- YOU COULD LEND US
SOME SWEET DISGUISES.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.825
- FELLAS, JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU NEED.

22:51.130 --> 22:54.930
- I HAVE NEVER FELT COOLER.

22:54.970 --> 22:55.834
- YOU'VE NEVER LOOKED COOLER.

22:55.870 --> 22:58.407
DENNIS IS GONNA HAVE
TO PRY THIS HELMET

22:58.440 --> 23:00.829
OF MY COLD, DEAD NOGGIN.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.974
THERE'S TOBY.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.547
- DUDE, HE'S SWEATING
AND SHAKING.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.751
- HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING CLUES
THIS WHOLE TIME?

23:13.790 --> 23:16.657
- PARANOIA IS ONE OF THE
TELLTALE SIGNS OF AN ABDUCT ION.

23:16.690 --> 23:18.555
- IT'S ALSO THE SIGN OF A GUY
WITH A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

23:18.590 --> 23:20.023
STOP SAYING STUPID THINGS.

23:20.060 --> 23:23.791
YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO THOSE GLASSES.

23:23.830 --> 23:25.388
- HE'S BOLTING, GUS!

23:29.570 --> 23:31.504
- HE'S WANDERING
TO UNKNOWN AREAS.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.508
- THIS HELMET IS NOT MADE
FOR RUNNING!

23:33.540 --> 23:35.508
I SHOULD HAVE BORROWED
CHARLTON HESTON'S SCARF

23:35.540 --> 23:37.679
FROM SOYLENT GREEN.

23:42.980 --> 23:45.517
- I CAN'T SEE
OUT THESE GLASSES, SHAWN.

23:45.550 --> 23:48.087
- WHERE'D HE GO?
WHERE'D HE GO?

23:48.120 --> 23:51.453
WE LOST HIM.
SON OF A...

23:51.490 --> 23:54.129
[cell phone rings]

23:54.160 --> 23:56.094
HELLO?
- IS THIS SHAWN SPENCER?

23:56.130 --> 23:58.223
- TOBY?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.192
- YOU GOTTA HELP ME.
THEY'RE FOLLOWING ME.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.458
- WHOA, WHOA.
CALM DOWN, MAN.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.797
WHO'S--
WHO'S FOLLOWING YOU?

24:02.840 --> 24:04.102
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.937
I THINK IT'S THE BLACK DUDE
FROM STAR TREK

24:05.970 --> 24:08.131
AND SOME WHITE GUY
IN A RIDICULOUS HELMET.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.569
- WHICH IS YOUR OPINION.
WHERE ARE YOU?

24:10.610 --> 24:11.804
- LISTEN TO ME.

24:11.850 --> 24:16.014
ROY KESSLER WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH.

24:16.050 --> 24:19.508
- OKAY...
YOU NEED TO COME MEET US.

24:19.550 --> 24:20.653
- I CAN'T.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

24:20.690 --> 24:23.215
UH, MEET ME IN AN HOUR IN FRONT
OF THE LANSDOWNE HOTEL.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.625
- LANSDOWNE. GOT IT.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.981
- DUDE, DID YOU JUST BREAK
DENNIS' HELMET?

24:27.030 --> 24:30.488
- WELL, IT CLEARLY WASN'T MADE
FOR RUNNING, GUS.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.521
YOU--

24:36.100 --> 24:38.034
- WAS THAT SCARF WORTH
GOING BACK TO DENNIS'?

24:38.070 --> 24:39.264
- IS SOYLENT GREEN PEOPLE?

24:39.310 --> 24:42.029
NOW LET'S GO GET THIS CONFESSION
OUT OF TOBY.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.843
- YOU MEAN ADMISSION
THAT HE WAS ABDUCTED.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.007
- LET'S START WITH THE
NON-BATCRAP ANGLE, SHALL WE?

24:46.050 --> 24:48.245
- SHAWN, YOU HEARD HIM SAY
KESSLER WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.942
- GUS, YOU'RE REALLY PUTTING ME
IN A TOUGH SPOT HERE, MAN.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.184
YOU DON'T THINK I WANT
TO BE THE GUY RIFFING

24:52.220 --> 24:54.586
ON HOW ALIENS ABDUCTED TOBY,

24:54.620 --> 24:56.508
AND WHAT THEY DID TO HIM WHEN
THEY BROUGHT HIM ON BOARD

24:56.560 --> 24:57.629
THE MOTHER SHIP?

24:57.660 --> 24:59.548
- THEY PROBED HIM AND PLACED
AN EMBRYO IN HIS STOMACH

24:59.590 --> 25:00.955
THAT'S GONNA HATCH
OUT HIS EARDRUM IN 12 DAYS.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.228
- I CAN'T DO IT!
SOMEONE HAS TO HOLD

25:02.260 --> 25:03.864
THE SANITY BAG
IN THIS PARTNERSHIP,

25:03.900 --> 25:04.719
AND QUITE FRANKLY,

25:04.770 --> 25:05.725
I MISS THE DAYS
WHEN IT USED TO BE YOU.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.989
- SHAWN, HE'S EXHIBITING
ALL THE TELLTALE SIGNS.

25:09.040 --> 25:13.261
PARANOIA, CHECK!
NERVOUSNESS, CHECK!

25:15.210 --> 25:18.270
- SUICIDAL TENDENCIES.
CHECK.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.817
- HEY, JULES.
WHAT'S THE WORD?

25:29.860 --> 25:31.953
- WELL, WE JUST FOUND OUT
THAT TOBY WIRED

25:31.990 --> 25:34.026
ALL OF THE MONEY
FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT,

25:34.060 --> 25:35.823
ABOUT 500 GRAND,
TO A CHARITY

25:35.860 --> 25:37.020
AN HOUR BEFORE HIS DEATH.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.891
WE HAVEN'T FOUND A NOTE YET,

25:40.840 --> 25:43.161
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.168
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S STRANGE
THAT A JUNIOR LAWYER

25:45.210 --> 25:46.438
HAS THAT KIND OF
ACCOUNT BALANCE?

25:46.470 --> 25:49.177
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT HE WAS
ROY KESSLER'S FORMER CO-WORKER.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.041
OOH, NO, MY SENSES ARE
TELLING ME

25:51.080 --> 25:53.071
THERE IS DEFINITELY MORE
TO THIS.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.816
- MUCH MORE.
- SETTLE.

25:54.850 --> 25:56.579
- LET ME GUESS.
YOU THINK

25:56.620 --> 25:57.939
THE LOCH NESS MONSTER
DID IT.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.946
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE
YOU TWO DOING HERE?

25:59.990 --> 26:01.912
- CAME TO GET GOING
ON THE TOBY SHORE CASE.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.109
- WHY? YOU'RE NOT BEING HIRED
ON IT.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.127
- SURELY YOU'RE CAN'T
BE SERIOUS.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.185
- SHAWN, I WARNED YOU.

26:06.230 --> 26:07.254
I CAN'T STICK MY NECK OUT
FOR TWO GUYS

26:07.290 --> 26:09.190
WHO ARE CURRENTLY VIEWED AS
THE VILLAGE IDIOTS.

26:09.230 --> 26:14.167
- VILLAGE IDIOTS?
WHO HERE THINKS THAT?

26:14.200 --> 26:15.633
DIRTY LARRY!

26:18.740 --> 26:21.300
JULES.
- SORRY.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.979
- LOOK, GUS AND I MIGHT BE
A LOT OF THINGS. HANDSOME...

26:24.010 --> 26:25.272
- CHISELED.
- INTELLIGENT.

26:25.310 --> 26:26.379
- URBANE.
- WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.617
BUT WE ARE NOT IDIOTS!

26:32.150 --> 26:33.287
OH, I'M SOR--
I'M SORRY, GUYS.

26:33.320 --> 26:37.108
MY BAD.

26:37.160 --> 26:37.979
THAT'S ALL ME.
BUT COME ON.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.179
WHO NEEDS A FAN THIS BIG?
SERIOUSLY.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.323
- LEAVE NOW!
- FINE.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.363
- FINE. WE'RE AUDI.
- ALL RIGHT...

26:44.400 --> 26:45.958
- SMOOTH MOVE!

26:46.000 --> 26:48.093
- COME ON, MAN,
GIVE A BROTHER SOME CREDIT.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.290
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.

26:50.340 --> 26:51.830
NADA.

26:51.870 --> 26:55.328
RECIPE FOR JULIET'S
WEIRD CLEANSE.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.871
PRELIMINARY CORONER'S REPORT.
- WHAT DOES IT SAY?

26:57.910 --> 27:01.414
- APPARENTLY THEY FOUND
A STRANGE OBJECT IN TOBY'S...

27:01.450 --> 27:02.872
STO MACH.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.649
- EMBRYO.

27:04.690 --> 27:07.409
- COME ON.

27:07.450 --> 27:09.850
- WOODROW!

27:09.890 --> 27:10.788
- HEY, BOYS.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.321
YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY
THESE FRENCH FRIES.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.224
THEY'RE KILLER.

27:14.260 --> 27:16.956
- WE ATE, THANKS.
- FOR THE LAST TIME.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.662
- WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE AUTOPSY

27:19.700 --> 27:21.167
YOU DID ON TOBY SHORE.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.235
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

27:22.270 --> 27:24.409
- COME ON, BUDDY,
WE KNOW YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.432
- FINE.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.438
I STOLE HIS WATCH.
- YOU DID WHAT?

27:29.480 --> 27:31.948
- HMM? NOTHING.
HEY, HOW 'BOUT SOME FRIED CLAMS?

27:31.980 --> 27:34.915
- WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU FOUND IN HIS STOMACH.

27:34.950 --> 27:37.077
- I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT.
I WILL GET IN TROUBLE.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.439
- REALLY?
MORE OR LESS TROUBLE

27:38.490 --> 27:40.014
THAN YOU'D GET IN
FOR LOOTING CORPSES?

27:40.050 --> 27:41.381
- THE OBJECT WAS
A FLASH DRIVE.

27:41.420 --> 27:42.318
- NOW, WHEN YOU SAY
FLASH DRIVE,

27:42.360 --> 27:44.328
IS THAT CORONER CODE
FOR AN ALIEN EMBRYO

27:44.360 --> 27:45.679
THAT HATCHES IN PEOPLE'S EAR?

27:45.730 --> 27:46.685
- NO, THAT'S THE WORD
"STARFISH."

27:46.730 --> 27:47.992
THIS WAS A LEGITIMATE

27:48.030 --> 27:49.452
FOUR GIGABYTE FLASH DRIVE.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.468
THERE WERE--

27:51.500 --> 27:53.024
I TAKE NOTES--

27:53.070 --> 27:55.959
ABRASIONS ON HIS LUNGS,
WHICH IMPLIED

27:56.000 --> 27:57.433
HE SWALLOWED IT
MOMENTS BEFORE HIS DEATH.

27:57.470 --> 27:58.300
- INTERESTING.

27:58.340 --> 28:00.103
WHAT ABOUT THE MARKINGS
ON HIS LEI-T ARM?

28:00.140 --> 28:02.005
- THAT WAS A BIRTH MARK.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.871
- HA!
WHERE IS THIS FLASH DRIVE NOW?

28:03.910 --> 28:05.400
- I BELIEVE IT'S WITH
DETECTIVE LASSITER.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.771
- GREAT. THANKS, WOODY.
YOU STAY CREEPY.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.447
- YOU KNOW I WILL.

28:17.320 --> 28:20.255
- YOU KNOW, SPENCER,
THE MINUTE YOU REFUSED TO HIRE

28:20.290 --> 28:22.952
THAT SMARMY, FORTUNE-TELLING KID
OF YOURS,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.299
YOU OFFICIALLY MADE IT OFF
MY CRAP LIST.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.195
HERE. SEE?

28:28.240 --> 28:33.303
- YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
A CRAP LIST?

28:33.340 --> 28:34.807
- I LIKE TO KEEP TRACK
OF PEOPLE WHO'VE WRONGED ME

28:34.840 --> 28:35.807
OVER THE YEARS.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.274
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE
YOUR SON, MY MOTHER...

28:38.310 --> 28:40.449
OLYMPIA FREAKIN' DUKAKIS!

28:40.480 --> 28:42.448
- YOU DISTURB ME.

28:42.480 --> 28:46.086
-DO I?

28:46.120 --> 28:48.918
WELCOME BACK, HENRY.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.178
BUT I'VE GOTTA SAY
IT IS REALLY NICE

28:51.230 --> 28:53.186
TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO DO
SOME REAL POLICE WORK

28:53.230 --> 28:56.290
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT
YOUR SON INTERFERING.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.958
WHAT THE HELL?

29:05.070 --> 29:08.176
CAN I GET SOMEBODY
FROM I.T. OVER HERE?

29:08.210 --> 29:11.077
DOBSON, COME HELP ME OUT!

29:13.180 --> 29:14.772
- I'M NOT SURE
HOW COMFORTABLE I AM

29:14.820 --> 29:15.844
HACKING A POLICE COMPUTER.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.472
- RELAX, IT'S HIS
PERSONAL ONE.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.509
WHICH REMINDS ME--

29:18.550 --> 29:20.188
CHECK THE INTERNET
SEARCH HISTORY.

29:20.220 --> 29:25.988
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE.

29:26.030 --> 29:26.985
"GRENADEFANCY.COM,

29:27.030 --> 29:29.123
SQUIRRELASSASSINS.COM."

29:29.160 --> 29:31.094
AND...

29:31.130 --> 29:32.791
THAT'S GROSS.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.229
- THAT MAN NEEDS JESUS.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.830
- LET'S SEE WHAT'S ON
THAT FLASH DRIVE, SHALL WE?

29:36.870 --> 29:37.962
- YEAH.

29:38.010 --> 29:41.377
- [clears throat]

29:41.410 --> 29:43.378
SORRY, GUS, DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A BLUEPRINT

29:43.410 --> 29:44.547
FOR AN ALIEN FERTILITY LAB.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.445
- SHOCKER!

29:46.480 --> 29:47.549
- IT'S JUST A BUNCH
OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS

29:47.580 --> 29:49.218
RELATED TO BUDDING TEXTILES.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.480
- THAT'S THAT INSANE CASE
KESSLER WAS WORKING ON.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.817
HE BELIEVED
THE BUDDING CHEMICAL SPILL

29:52.850 --> 29:53.919
WAS DONE ON PURPOSE.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.518
- [chuckles]
THAT IS CRAZY.

30:04.430 --> 30:05.522
- I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.390
both: WE KNOW.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.864
- DAMN, I'VE REALLY GOTTA
STOP DOING THAT.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.607
- DENNY, WHERE ARE YOU?

30:12.640 --> 30:14.403
- QUICK, WE GOTTA GET OUT
OF HERE! GO, GO, GO, GO!

30:14.440 --> 30:17.944
DENNY? DENNY?

30:17.980 --> 30:19.971
- ONE MINUTE, BABE.

30:20.010 --> 30:22.149
- DENNY?
- AAH...

30:22.180 --> 30:24.080
WAAAA!

30:24.120 --> 30:25.587
- HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

30:25.620 --> 30:28.180
- UH, YOU KNOW,
GUY STUFF.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.256
- STEAK.

30:30.290 --> 30:31.621
- DENNY, YOU CAN'T HOST
A FOOTBALL PARTY

30:31.660 --> 30:32.888
FROM INSIDE YOUR OFFICE.

30:32.930 --> 30:34.056
COME ON, TAYLOR JUST GOT
A SAFETY!

30:34.100 --> 30:38.321
SWEET!
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, BABE.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.565
- OKAY.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.398
- BYE, MOLLY.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.000
- WHAT'S A SAFETY?
- REALLY?

30:46.040 --> 30:47.337
LOOK, DENNIS, WHY DON'T YOU
BLOW OFF THIS PARTY

30:47.370 --> 30:48.906
AND COME WITH GUS AND I?

30:48.940 --> 30:50.373
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- YEAH, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

30:50.410 --> 30:53.379
- I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE, BUT
I KNOW IT INVOLVES A SMALL TOWN

30:53.410 --> 30:54.479
AND SOME POTENTIAL DANGER.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.169
- OH, WOW, THAT SOUNDS COOL.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.541
- HOW MUCH DANGER?
- BUT I CAN'T, MAN.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.239
MOLLY WOULD KILL ME!

31:00.290 --> 31:02.019
- DENNIS, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

31:02.060 --> 31:03.254
TO BE A NORMAL GUY

31:03.290 --> 31:06.384
AS LONG AS YOU'RE PRETENDING
TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT.

31:06.430 --> 31:07.522
- TRUST ME, HE KNOWS.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.425
- COME ON.

31:09.460 --> 31:11.064
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GET OUT THERE

31:11.100 --> 31:12.192
AND EXPERIENCE
SOME REAL-LIFE,

31:12.230 --> 31:14.198
NON-VIRTUAL ADVENTURE.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.391
- HE'S RIGHT. IT'S TIME TO
COME OUT OF THE NERD CLOSET.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.371
- I'M SORRY, GUYS,
I JUST CAN'T.

31:24.410 --> 31:27.277
I REALLY LIKE HAVING SEX
WITH MY WIFE.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.184
- DON'T SAY IT.

31:31.220 --> 31:34.053
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?

31:43.330 --> 31:44.399
- NOW IS THE POINT
WHERE YOU TELL ME

31:44.430 --> 31:45.920
WHAT THE HELL
WE'RE DOING HERE.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.392
- GUESS WHO'S NOW
THE PROUD OWNER OF THIS HOME...

31:47.430 --> 31:49.933
ALONG WITH THE 700
SIMILAR ONES

31:49.970 --> 31:51.198
THAT MAKE UP
THIS TINY TOWN.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.434
- SHAWN, IF YOU SAY "US,"

31:52.470 --> 31:53.368
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE FACE.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.230
- BUDDING TEXTILES.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.679
IT'S THE LAST ONE
THEY PURCHASED.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.371
- WHY WOULD BUDDING WANT
A BUNCH OF CRAPPY HOUSES

31:58.410 --> 31:59.399
ON POISONED LAND?

31:59.450 --> 32:00.701
- HERE'S A BETTER QUESTION--

32:00.750 --> 32:02.718
WHAT IS THE WORLD'S
COOLEST TRUCK DOING HERE?

32:02.750 --> 32:04.308
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A DECEPTICON.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.989
- IT'S NOT A DECEPTICON, GUS.
IT WAS MADE IN FRESNO.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.055
- WHATEVER IT IS,
I HIGHLY SUGGEST

32:08.090 --> 32:10.354
WE DO NOT TOUCH IT.

32:10.390 --> 32:13.359
[truck engine starts]

32:13.390 --> 32:16.518
SHAWN!

32:18.070 --> 32:19.958
- GUS, THE KEYS WERE ALREADY
IN THE IGNITION.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.638
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
- NOT START IT.

32:21.670 --> 32:23.535
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
- ACTUALLY, IT IS.

32:23.570 --> 32:26.334
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN TOBY SAID

32:26.370 --> 32:27.701
THAT ROY KESSLER WAS
TELLING THE TRUTH,

32:27.740 --> 32:29.139
HE DIDN'T MEAN AN ABDUCTION.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.273
HE MEANT THE LAWSUIT
AGAINST BUDDING.

32:31.310 --> 32:33.005
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE,
SHAWN.

32:33.050 --> 32:35.041
WHY WOULD THEY INTENTIONALLY
SPILL CHEMICALS?

32:37.720 --> 32:40.518
- TO GET PEOPLE TO LEAVE.
- WHAT?

32:40.550 --> 32:42.051
- IN ALL THE RIDICULOUS
SCIENCE CLASSES

32:42.090 --> 32:43.159
YOU'VE TAKEN OVER THE YEARS,

32:43.190 --> 32:45.055
DID YOU EVER LEARN ABOUT
HYDROCARBONS?

32:45.090 --> 32:46.387
- OF COURSE I DID.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.295
THE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
FOUND MAINLY IN CRUDE OIL.

32:48.330 --> 32:49.752
- IF THERE'S A HIGH PERCENTAGE
OF THEM IN THE SOIL,

32:49.800 --> 32:51.392
DOES THAT MEAN THAT
THERE'S OIL UNDERNEATH?

32:51.430 --> 32:53.591
- NOT NECESSARILY. YOU'D HAVE
TO CHECK USING A MACHINE

32:53.630 --> 32:55.769
THAT SENDS SONIC VIBRATIONS
INTO THE EARTH...

32:55.800 --> 33:00.032
[loud rumbling and banging]

33:00.070 --> 33:01.628
- I THINK WE'RE IN
ONE OF THOSE MACHINES!

33:01.680 --> 33:03.432
- WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS
TOUCH STUFF, SHAWN?

33:15.620 --> 33:17.156
IT STOPPED SHAKING, SHAWN.

33:17.190 --> 33:20.682
- OH.

33:23.230 --> 33:26.267
GUS, I FEEL LIKE
A BOBBLEHEAD.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.494
- YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.
- COME ON, TRY IT.

33:27.530 --> 33:28.667
- I'M NOT DOING THAT.
- GET IN ON THE BIT.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.167
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- IT'S FUN!

33:30.200 --> 33:32.168
- FINE.
- DUDE, YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.563
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

33:33.610 --> 33:35.202
BUDDING FIGURED OUT THAT
THIS TOWN IS SITTING

33:35.240 --> 33:36.207
ON A GOLD MINE.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.332
SO WHAT DOES HE DO?

33:37.380 --> 33:39.769
HE ORCHESTRATES A CHEMICAL SPILL
TO DRIVE EVERYONE AWAY.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.675
- THAT WAY HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
SHARE ANY OF THE PROFITS.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.280
- EXACTLY. WHICH, I IMAGINE,
DWARFS THE COST OF LAWSUITS

33:44.320 --> 33:45.742
AND LAND PURCHASES.

33:45.790 --> 33:46.609
- AND KESSLER WAS ONTO
ALL OF THIS.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.357
- WHICH SORT OF FREAKS ME OUT.
- WHY?

33:49.390 --> 33:51.449
- BECAUSE IT MAKES ME WONDER
WHAT ELSE

33:51.490 --> 33:54.425
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT.

33:54.460 --> 33:58.419
[loud whirring]

33:58.470 --> 34:02.031
-AAH! AAAAAAH!

34:06.140 --> 34:08.301
- AAH! AA--

34:12.150 --> 34:15.608
- I DON'T WANT TO
GET PROBED, GUS!

34:15.650 --> 34:16.742
- WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

34:16.780 --> 34:18.145
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LESS EXOTIC!

34:18.190 --> 34:20.146
- WHA--

34:20.190 --> 34:23.512
[both grunting]

34:23.560 --> 34:26.188
-AAH! AAH!

34:39.170 --> 34:44.608
- GET IN HERE!

34:44.650 --> 34:48.768
- AAH! AAH! OH...OH...

34:48.820 --> 34:52.085
OH...AAH!

34:59.560 --> 35:02.154
- WELL, BOYS...
START TALKING.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.394
- ABOUT WHAT, EXACTLY?

35:03.430 --> 35:04.567
HOW 'BOUT A STORY?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.867
I ALWAYS ENJOY A GOOD ONE.
- ALL RIGHT.

35:07.900 --> 35:11.131
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS
THIS GREEDY CEO.

35:11.170 --> 35:13.365
THINK, WHAT, STEPHEN LANG?
- "ESQUE."

35:13.410 --> 35:14.809
- ANYWAY, HE WANTED TO KILL
THIS LAWYER,

35:14.840 --> 35:15.829
BECAUSE THE LAWYER WAS
ON THE VERGE

35:15.880 --> 35:18.508
OF RUINING HIS EVIL
MASTER PLAN.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.302
BUT HE COULDN'T,
BECAUSE THE LAWYER HAD PREPARED

35:20.350 --> 35:21.442
A LEGITIMATE CASE
AGAINST HIM.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.675
- HOT START.
PLEASE CONTINUE.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.642
- HE FIGURED OUT
THAT IF HE COULD

35:25.690 --> 35:26.918
MAKE THE LAWYER LOOK WACKO,

35:26.950 --> 35:29.589
THE CASE WOULD BE DISMISSED AS
SOME NUTTY CONSPIRACY THEORY.

35:29.620 --> 35:30.587
BUT HOW?

35:30.620 --> 35:31.655
- AND TEN YEARS AGO,

35:31.690 --> 35:35.558
KESSLER CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN,
YOU GOT IT, A UFO!

35:35.600 --> 35:36.749
- LIGHT BULB.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.667
HE WOULD CONVINCE THE LAWYER
HE'D WITNESSED AN ABDUCT ION.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.588
SEE, HE ALREADY HAD
THIS FANCY COPTER,

35:41.640 --> 35:43.938
SO ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS
ADD SOME EXTRA LIGHTING,

35:43.970 --> 35:45.767
PUMP SOME ENYA B-SIDES
THROUGH THE SOUND SYSTEM,

35:45.810 --> 35:48.335
AND THEN FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TRIP THE ELECTRICITY.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.371
- HE MOST LIKELY USED
AN EMP DEVICE.

35:50.410 --> 35:51.946
- WHAT IS THAT,
A PREGNANCY TEST?

35:51.980 --> 35:53.845
- NO.
- DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, GUS.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.040
WOULD YOU JUST LET ME
TELL THE STORY?

35:55.080 --> 35:57.173
- EMT, NOT EPT.
IT PRODUCES AN ELECTRICAL PULSE.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.711
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THERE'S A FINE LINE

35:59.750 --> 36:00.819
BETWEEN BEING KNOWLEDGEABLE
AND ARROGANT.

36:00.850 --> 36:02.317
- ENOUGH!

36:02.360 --> 36:03.850
I'M ON THE EDGE
OF MY SEAT HERE.

36:03.890 --> 36:06.688
- RIGHT. WELL,
IT ALL WORKED LIKE A CHARM,

36:06.730 --> 36:07.685
WITH ONE EXCEPTION.

36:07.730 --> 36:11.723
SEE, THE YOUNG LAWYER
THAT HE PAID 500 Gs TO

36:11.770 --> 36:13.658
TO SET UP THIS GUY,
HAD A CHANGE OF HEART

36:13.700 --> 36:16.430
ONCE HE CAME ACROSS
THE DISMISSED-CASE FILE.

36:16.470 --> 36:19.667
BUT IT WAS STILL
JUST A MINOR MISHAP FOR OUR CEO

36:19.710 --> 36:22.907
BECAUSE HE IS
A PROBLEM SOLVER.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.239
[thud]

36:33.290 --> 36:35.758
- I LIKE HIS STYLE.
- YEAH.

36:35.790 --> 36:38.588
AND HE WAS IN THE CLEAR
UNTIL HE CAME ACROSS

36:38.630 --> 36:41.326
TWO YOUNG GO-GETTERS,

36:41.360 --> 36:42.657
AND THEY WERE ONTO
EVERYTHING.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.289
- WHO HE THEN PROCEEDED
TO LET GO

36:49.340 --> 36:51.638
BECAUSE THEY PROMISED
NOT TO TELL A SOUL.

36:51.670 --> 36:52.739
- SWORE. THEY SWORE.

36:52.770 --> 36:54.374
BECAUSE THAT'S STRONGER
THAN A PROMISE.

36:54.410 --> 36:55.570
- [scoffs]

36:55.610 --> 36:56.702
- [laughs]

36:56.740 --> 37:00.744
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- IT'S NOT?

37:00.780 --> 37:03.977
- AND TO THINK I ONLY
PICKED YOU UP FOR TRESPASSING.

37:04.020 --> 37:07.547
- WHOOPS.
- TAKE 'EM OUT BACK.

37:07.590 --> 37:09.319
- [whispering]
DON'T WORRY, I TEXTED MY DAD.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.509
THE COPS WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.358
- NO...NO!
[knock on door]

37:15.430 --> 37:17.819
[knock on door]
- WHO IS IT?

37:17.860 --> 37:19.521
- MESSENGER SERVICE

37:19.570 --> 37:22.664
- HEY. I HAVE A DELIVERY
FOR YOU TO SIGN.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.668
- DENNIS?
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

37:24.710 --> 37:25.665
- I DON'T KNOW.
- LET'S SEE SOME I.D.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.632
- YEAH, YEAH. SURE.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.398
- HYAH!
- WHOA!

37:32.450 --> 37:34.611
