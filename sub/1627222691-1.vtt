[brooding orchestral music]

[Susan sighing]

01:14.950 --> 01:15.910
Good morning.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.995
Morning, baby.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.162
You were up late.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.081
Just FaceTiming friends.

01:21.122 --> 01:22.917
Get any packing done?

01:22.958 --> 01:25.002
[exhales] Not yet.

01:25.044 --> 01:28.005
You should start. Maybe
we can do some tomorrow.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.631
You really can't wait to
get rid of me.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.799
What?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.300
No, that isn't it.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.303
Are you sure? 'Cause
it kinda feels like it.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.014
Still got a month before
school starts.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.974
I know.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.100
I just know that packing always
takes longer than you think

01:41.142 --> 01:44.980
and I don't want you
panicking before you leave.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.108
I'll miss you every day.

01:48.149 --> 01:51.987
It's gonna be really weird
not having you around here.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.655
Having the house to myself.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.576
Okay. I'll get on it, I promise.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.913
Don't worry, there's still
plenty of time for me to panic.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.373
Smart ass.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.918
Whoa, is this the place
you're showing today?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.836
-All 70 acres.
-[gentle music]

02:07.878 --> 02:11.131
This place is amazing.
Look at that view.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.800
Is that a movie theater?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.384
Yes, it is an at-home
[post accent] theater.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.594
[chuckling]

02:15.636 --> 02:18.263
This place was a
huge get for me.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.349
I sell this, it'll move me into
the higher-end sales market.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.061
Not to mention the
commission I'll net.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.854
You'll sell it. I know you will.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.356
-This place sells itself.
-Mm, from your lips.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.820
How about we do dinner?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.321
I'm done at five.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.823
Okay, what's up?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.574
What do you mean?

02:37.616 --> 02:39.534
We never go out
to dinner anymore.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.161
What's the occasion?

02:41.202 --> 02:43.538
Nothing, it's just...

02:44.581 --> 02:46.125
we haven't spent
much time together

02:46.166 --> 02:48.085
this summer and you're leaving.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.129
Besides, two ladies
can't go out on the town

02:50.169 --> 02:51.296
and have some fun?

02:51.338 --> 02:53.214
Okay. As long as
you're not

02:53.256 --> 02:54.508
using me as
your wing woman.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.593
-[chuckling]
-Trust me.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.138
The only thing I'm in the
market for is some sushi.

02:59.178 --> 03:02.016
[chuckles] Okay,
sounds great.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.809
[kisses]
Good luck today.

03:03.851 --> 03:04.810
You're gonna do great.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.103
Thank you.

03:11.274 --> 03:16.613
-[door closing]
-[brooding gentle music]

03:21.242 --> 03:23.078
[Darren] So they finally
agreed to sell, huh?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.663
Yep.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.998
You have no idea how hard

03:26.040 --> 03:27.248
I had to work
to convince them.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.333
Oh, I'm sure.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.751
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.046
Today's the first day on the
market, so you'll probably see

03:32.087 --> 03:34.048
a lot of cars around you
don't recognize.

03:34.089 --> 03:37.592
Well, I won't harass them too
much. No promises, though.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.386
You know, a lot of the
folks around here

03:39.427 --> 03:41.013
are gone for the weekend.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.223
It's the dilemma of having
multiple houses, right?

03:43.264 --> 03:44.599
-I wouldn't know.
-[chuckles]

03:44.641 --> 03:46.935
Hm. I've been up there
once or twice

03:46.977 --> 03:48.311
just to check on things.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.604
That's a big piece of land.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.689
Come on up if you have time.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.940
I'll give you the tour.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.192
Maybe you'll wanna
make an offer.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.610
On my salary?
[chuckling]

03:55.652 --> 03:57.445
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

Let's do this.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.982
[distant creaking]

05:18.277 --> 05:19.360
Hello?

05:19.402 --> 05:23.406
[suspenseful music]

05:34.168 --> 05:36.795
[distant creaking]

05:36.837 --> 05:38.755
Is someone there?

[ominous eerie music]

05:58.942 --> 06:02.070
[dramatic eerie music]

06:04.447 --> 06:05.448
[sighs]

06:05.490 --> 06:07.159
-Paul, Paul.
-Sorry.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.660
Didn't mean to scare you.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.040
Just wanted to check in.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.542
Make sure you didn't need
anything before the big day.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.419
I'm good! As ready as I can be.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.421
Smell that?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.132
Pine trees?

06:22.174 --> 06:24.092
Multiple offers,
over asking.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.220
That's what that is.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.472
You know, I still don't know
how you convinced them to sell.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.893
I've been trying to bag
this listing for years.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.769
I told them how hot
the market is,

06:34.811 --> 06:36.980
what I would do to
help them sell.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.607
I think they just really
wanted to hear the truth.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.400
Really? That worked?

06:41.442 --> 06:42.569
I'll have to try it sometime.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.445
[chuckles]

06:44.487 --> 06:47.866
I can pretty persuasive
when I have to be.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.161
I'm sure you can.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.373
You know, I'm looking forward
to having you on the team.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.792
After this sells, we'll get
your home on the market.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.171
Ah, maybe not
quite so fast.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.924
I just wanna get Heather
settled at school first.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.843
-You still haven't told her?
-[ominous music]

07:06.885 --> 07:11.223
I don't know how to. It's the
only home she's ever known.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.143
I get it. I know how much
it means to you.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.397
But don't let it
hold you captive.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.274
You know, like we
tell our clients.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.568
"It's what fills a house
that makes it a home."

07:25.070 --> 07:27.447
Besides, from what
you've told me,

07:27.488 --> 07:30.033
she seems like
a smart kid.

07:30.075 --> 07:34.037
She'll understand and she'll
want what's best for you.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.373
We're supposed to have
dinner tonight

07:36.415 --> 07:37.749
after the open house.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.459
I'm planning on
telling her tonight.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.752
You should.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.920
It'll give her time
to enjoy it

07:41.962 --> 07:43.546
before she leaves.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.507
Besides, you don't wanna
miss the market.

07:46.549 --> 07:50.095
Speaking of, I've got my
own appointment to get to.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.098
But check in with me
before the end of the day.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.016
I wanna hear how much
they love the place.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.226
Sure thing, boss!

08:01.231 --> 08:04.025
[Heather] I swear!
It's like she's pushing
me out the door.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.526
-I'm sure that's not it.
-It is!

08:05.568 --> 08:07.821
It's like she can't wait
to get rid of me.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.281
[panting]

08:09.323 --> 08:10.449
Did you talk to her about it?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.450
No.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.742
You should.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.035
Let her know
that's how you feel.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.872
I just don't get why she's
so eager for me to go.

08:17.914 --> 08:21.001
It's probably just a defense
mechanism. Think about it.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.920
First, your dad. Now you
heading off to college?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.755
I mean, she's about
to be alone

08:25.797 --> 08:27.966
for the first time
in over 20 years.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.468
That's huge.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.220
Talk to her about it.

08:32.262 --> 08:33.305
[sighing] I will.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.806
We're having dinner tonight.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.557
-Thanks, you're the best.
-Oh, I know.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.060
I keep telling people I deserve
my own daytime talk show,

08:39.102 --> 08:41.813
-but they don't listen.
-[laughing]

08:41.855 --> 08:43.690
-One more lap?
-Sure.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.775
[doorbell ringing]

08:45.817 --> 08:48.320
-Welcome! I'm Susan.
-[gentle music]

08:48.362 --> 08:49.737
Come in.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.659
A total of 6,000 square feet,

08:54.701 --> 08:57.204
and every amenity that
you can imagine.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.376
The game room. The pool
and shuffle board table

09:02.417 --> 09:03.877
come with the house.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.005
Great way to keep the
kids occupied for hours.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.673
A temperature-controlled
wine cellar,

09:08.715 --> 09:11.468
capable of holding
over 1,000 bottles.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.303
The original property
was a winery,

09:13.345 --> 09:16.597
so much of what you see
here is personal reserve.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.642
Here's the master bedroom,

09:19.684 --> 09:22.729
complete with a giant
en suite bathroom.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.861
Its own at-home theater
with built-in surround sound

09:29.903 --> 09:31.446
and Wi-fi for streaming.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.616
And all of it guarded by
a high-end security system

09:35.658 --> 09:37.536
and wireless
surveillance cameras,

09:37.577 --> 09:41.039
with an intercom system
across the entire property.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.166
There's also
a lockdown switch here,

09:43.208 --> 09:47.254
which automatically secures
all exterior doors and windows.

09:53.176 --> 09:58.056
A total of 70 acres of fenced
land, ensuring your privacy.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.184
You won't hear them
and they won't hear you.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.728
Or your baby.

10:09.150 --> 10:12.279
Thanks for coming.
I'm so glad you liked it.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.073
Just have your agent
reach out to me.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.616
Bye!

[knocking]

10:55.572 --> 10:58.866
[dramatic music]

10:58.908 --> 11:00.701
[Susan] Hi!

11:00.743 --> 11:02.621
I thought I was
meeting you at home?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.998
I know, but I had
Tracy drop me.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.916
I had to see this
place for myself.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.793
Wow.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.421
This place is, like,
crazy amazing.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.797
It's even better than
the pictures.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.258
I know, it's really something.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.675
So?

11:16.717 --> 11:17.718
How'd it go?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.596
-Great.
-[laughing]

11:19.638 --> 11:22.098
Multiple people said
they wanna make an offer.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.891
-We'll see who actually does.
-That's great, Mom.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.519
-I'm so happy for you.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.646

What is going on out there?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.694
[helicopter blades whirring]

11:35.736 --> 11:38.281
We passed a whole slew of
police cars on our way here.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.033
They're going all around
the neighborhood.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.202
[Susan] Something happened,
that's for sure.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.995
I'm starving. Can we go?

11:44.871 --> 11:47.040
Sure. Let me just pack up.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.420
[tense music]

11:58.843 --> 12:00.178
Oh, great.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.764
It never fails.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.436
[sighing]

12:08.478 --> 12:09.896
More buyers?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.690
Looks like it.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.983
It's after five. I'll
tell them to come back.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.652
Really? Why? I mean,

12:15.694 --> 12:17.736
you're here,
they're here.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.280
May as well show 'em. Who knows?

12:19.322 --> 12:21.949
Could be the people
that grossly overpay.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.493
You wanna do the showing?

12:23.535 --> 12:25.786
-[chuckling]
-Nope, it's all you.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.039
I'll hide in the back
while you do your thing.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.260
[sighs]

12:43.388 --> 12:45.348
Hi. We hope we're
not too late.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.017
We were just driving by
it and we had to stop.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.686
Showings ended at five.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.064
-But it's fine. Come on in.
-Thank you.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.276
I swear we will be in and out
of here as fast as possible.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.321
[suspenseful ominous music]

13:00.363 --> 13:03.658
[door slamming]

13:03.700 --> 13:05.660
This is the main living area.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.539
It has an open floor plan that
leads right to the kitchen.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.082
Wow.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.500
Look at this place.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.921
Are you all right?
You're sweating.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.466
Air conditioner
conked out in the car.

13:19.798 --> 13:20.925
I'm fine, thanks.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.971
-Typical, right?
-[distant siren wails]

13:25.930 --> 13:27.932
There's something going
on out there.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.768
That's the third
siren I've heard.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.355
We didn't notice anything.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.942
Really? Huh.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.987
Let me give you
the rest of the tour.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.788
[phone chiming]

13:49.828 --> 13:51.956
[Heather sighing]

13:52.873 --> 13:55.460
And upstairs we have
two more bedrooms,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.545
as well as
the master suite.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.758
[Keith grunting]

14:16.815 --> 14:18.857
Have you seen many properties?

14:18.899 --> 14:21.110
Uh, a few, but nothing
we've loved yet.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.029
Well, it's hard not to
love this one.

14:23.070 --> 14:27.033
There's five bedrooms, four
baths. Sits on 70 acres of land.

14:27.074 --> 14:30.745
As you saw on the way up,
privacy isn't an issue.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.913
Come see the master bath.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.930
[distant chatter]

14:49.972 --> 14:52.517
For those nights you need
to work out the kinks.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.230
Looks like you could
use one now.
[chuckles awkwardly]

14:58.439 --> 15:00.107
[Keith chuckles]

15:01.317 --> 15:04.111
[tense suspenseful music]

15:19.753 --> 15:21.546
Wait till you see
the walk-in closet.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
There's so much space.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.759
[tense music]

15:25.800 --> 15:27.677
Oh, my god. You're bleeding.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.178
No, I'm fine.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.055
Did you cut yourself?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.182
-Look, let me see.
-I'm fine!

15:33.224 --> 15:34.559
[groaning]

15:34.601 --> 15:38.020
Oh, my god. We need to
get you help.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.356
We're not calling anyone.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.817
[ominous music]

15:44.485 --> 15:45.820
[Keith] We're not
gonna hurt you.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.488
Not as long as you
do what we say.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.782
[gasping]

15:52.827 --> 15:54.328
Who else is here?

15:54.913 --> 15:56.497
No one. It's just me.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.499
[Keith whimpers]

15:58.958 --> 16:00.334
Here.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.802
[groaning]

16:10.010 --> 16:12.972
[suspenseful ominous music]

16:49.216 --> 16:51.803
All right, let's go. Downstairs.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.270
[grunts]

17:20.206 --> 17:23.167
[tense suspenseful music]

17:36.639 --> 17:38.391
[Heather gasps]

17:41.936 --> 17:45.023
[tense music]

17:55.533 --> 17:58.953
[distant siren wailing]

18:03.875 --> 18:05.668
Cops are still all
over the streets.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.294
Should've kept movin'.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.673
[Keith] Taken our chances.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.175
I think we've taken
enough chances for one day.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.013
So all that's
because of you?

18:17.055 --> 18:19.599
We just need a place
to lay low for a while.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.226
Till the cops go.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.937
Think you'll make it that long?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.735
[stair creaking]

18:31.151 --> 18:33.821
[suspenseful music]

18:35.907 --> 18:37.825
I'll ask again.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.035
Who else is here?

18:39.827 --> 18:43.163
I told you, no one.
House is settling.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.417
[scoffing]
Sure it is.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.211
I'm gonna finish the tour.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.760
-[stair creaking]
-[ominous tense music]

19:26.248 --> 19:28.126
You look like you could
use some water.

19:39.261 --> 19:43.808
-[door creaks]
-[suspenseful eerie music]

20:03.494 --> 20:04.954
[helicopter blades whirring]

20:04.996 --> 20:05.913
[dark suspenseful music]

20:05.955 --> 20:06.956
We good?

20:06.998 --> 20:08.374
[man] We're good.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.095
[Natalie sighing]

20:23.430 --> 20:24.682
Liar.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.361
You're a liar.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.113
One of the buyers
must've left it.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.118
Nice try.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.079
Where is she?

20:46.495 --> 20:49.082
My guess? Probably halfway
to those cops by now.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.667
If you leave right now,
you might be able to get away.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.796
Where?

20:56.214 --> 20:58.591
I don't know.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.015
Where's the security system?

21:07.516 --> 21:09.102
-What secure--
-[slap]

21:19.028 --> 21:21.781
[tense music]

21:24.324 --> 21:26.786
She's outside. Southeast
corner of the property.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.955
-She's headed for the road.
-The car.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.414
-Go!
-No!

21:30.456 --> 21:31.958
Don't you touch her!

21:38.547 --> 21:41.801
Don't you touch her! Don't
you hurt her, I swear!

21:41.842 --> 21:43.052
Get in!

21:44.678 --> 21:47.306
[Susan] I will kill you
if you hurt her!

21:48.348 --> 21:49.642
Open up! [pounds door]

21:49.683 --> 21:53.020
[tense orchestral music]

21:55.355 --> 21:57.942
[Heather panting]

22:01.862 --> 22:05.199
[suspenseful music]

22:23.383 --> 22:26.012
[gate humming]

22:27.263 --> 22:31.267
[tense suspenseful music]

22:36.647 --> 22:39.692
[siren wailing]

22:42.945 --> 22:44.155
Help!

22:45.906 --> 22:47.116
Help!

22:47.158 --> 22:51.329
-[yelping]
-[sirens wailing]

23:03.216 --> 23:06.177
-[rapid knocking]
-Let me out!

23:06.219 --> 23:09.347
Please don't hurt her!

23:11.098 --> 23:12.266
[tense gentle music]

23:12.308 --> 23:14.434
Oh, baby.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.854
Are you all right?

23:17.980 --> 23:20.024
[gasping]

23:20.066 --> 23:22.151
You lie to me again,

23:22.193 --> 23:24.904
it is going to get very bad.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.324
For both of you.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.749
Cops are still over the streets.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.253
Everyone get comfy.

23:41.962 --> 23:45.465
[brooding orchestral music]

23:48.010 --> 23:49.262
[grunting]

23:49.303 --> 23:51.597
[Susan] Get your hands off her.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.684
[cable tie zipping]

23:55.726 --> 23:58.145
[tense music]

24:03.483 --> 24:05.027
[cable tie zipping]

24:10.157 --> 24:12.993
Before you tie me up, we should
probably take care of that.

24:16.496 --> 24:20.167
You're obviously not making it
to a hospital any time soon.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.877
You're losing blood.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.259
Not to mention you're sort of
bleeding all over the carpet.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.594
There's a first aid
kit in my car.

24:34.932 --> 24:38.185
-[Keith groaning]
-[Natalie sighing]

24:38.227 --> 24:39.437
I'll go.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.647
They do anything stupid,

24:41.688 --> 24:44.150
[chuckling] make 'em
pay for it.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.029
[Keith groaning]

25:02.251 --> 25:03.501
[keys jingling]

25:04.920 --> 25:08.674
We should move the cars.
Put 'em out of sight.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.384
Just in case.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.139
Anything else?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.650
I know you're both scared.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.820
Just cooperate and
no one will get hurt.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.156
Be a lot easier to believe

25:32.198 --> 25:34.074
if you weren't
covered in blood.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.661
[tense orchestral music]

25:44.960 --> 25:48.339
For the record, this was
never part of the plan.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.632
So there was a plan?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.885
There's always a plan,

25:52.926 --> 25:55.971
and it always goes off
without a hitch.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.516
This seems to be
a pretty big hitch.

26:04.021 --> 26:07.066
[distant siren wailing]

26:13.364 --> 26:16.200
[garage door humming]

26:20.787 --> 26:22.706
Why are you helping me?

26:22.748 --> 26:24.041
I'm not.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.751
I'm helping us.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.713
Honestly, your partner
is a little on edge,

26:29.755 --> 26:33.217
and I'm afraid what she might
do if you lose consciousness.

26:34.134 --> 26:39.432
-[footsteps approach]
-[tense gentle music]

26:41.267 --> 26:43.102
Anything else, Your Highness?

26:45.563 --> 26:47.647
I guess just some towels.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.485
[Natalie scoffing]

26:55.239 --> 26:57.491
I need you to take that off.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.620
[Keith groaning]

27:04.790 --> 27:06.417
Let me help.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.003
[Keith groaning]

27:13.882 --> 27:15.633
Here.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.433
[Keith groaning]

27:22.475 --> 27:23.976
[Susan] All right, well,

27:24.017 --> 27:26.186
the good news is the
bullet went right through.

27:27.813 --> 27:31.066
Bad news is we have
two holes to stitch.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.068
[sighing]

27:43.745 --> 27:46.081
[Natalie sighs]

27:49.335 --> 27:52.421
[ominous tones]

27:54.590 --> 27:58.718
[tense suspenseful music]

27:59.512 --> 28:02.556
[phone ringing]

28:02.598 --> 28:04.600
Wow, your husband's annoying.

28:04.642 --> 28:06.810
This is the third
time he's called.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.355
Sorry, Paul.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.857
He's my boss. I'm not married.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.196
Divorced?

28:19.448 --> 28:20.740
Widowed.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.328
I'm sorry.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.997
He's asking how
the showings went.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.748
[scoffs] Typical.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.584
All about the money.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.337
You should let me text him
back so he doesn't worry.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.550
No. No contact.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.302
I can't be sure you
won't slip him a message

28:40.344 --> 28:41.428
and tip him off.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.726
This is gonna hurt.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.311
Worse than a gunshot?
[chuckles]

28:56.443 --> 28:58.529
[grunting]

29:01.990 --> 29:04.034
[grunting]

29:08.622 --> 29:10.874
I didn't know you could do that.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.669
Sew? Are you kidding?

29:13.711 --> 29:16.547
When you were little, I used
to stitch all your clothes.

29:19.633 --> 29:22.135
Your father and I didn't
have much when we started.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.470
[Natalie scoffing]

29:23.512 --> 29:24.763
Right.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.892
You think I don't know
what it's like to struggle?

29:28.934 --> 29:30.310
To worry?

29:31.853 --> 29:33.897
Worry about what?

29:33.939 --> 29:36.858
Buying your next $2,000 bag?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.902
You don't think I know
what that's worth?

29:38.944 --> 29:42.281
You know, [sighs] folks like
you, your idea of being broke

29:42.322 --> 29:45.534
is having to skimp on
your yearly trip to Cabo.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.911
We've never been to Cabo.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.829
[Natalie chuckling]

29:49.871 --> 29:51.457
The point is...

29:52.874 --> 29:54.834
You're entitled.

29:54.876 --> 29:58.797
You guys live in these big
mansions behind giant gates

29:58.838 --> 30:01.216
and your private security?

30:01.258 --> 30:03.510
The haves and have-mores.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.596
You know, always helping each
other, while everyone else

30:05.638 --> 30:08.474
outside of the gates has
to fight for what's left.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.811
For scraps.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.982
[scoffs] We're just
evening the score
a little.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.858
Hey.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.946
Can we debate ethics later
and let the woman focus?

30:27.033 --> 30:28.702
Not everything's what it seems.

30:29.453 --> 30:32.790
I'm just trying to make
a living, provide for my family.

30:33.415 --> 30:35.208
And the bag's a knockoff.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.716
[Keith breathing deeply]

30:45.010 --> 30:46.136
That's one.

30:47.513 --> 30:51.350
-[intercom buzzing]
-[tense music]

30:51.391 --> 30:52.851
That's the security gate.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.396
[Keith groaning]

31:02.736 --> 31:04.904
[intercom buzzing]

31:04.946 --> 31:06.824
[Keith] It's a cop.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.241
Ignore him. He'll go away.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.035
With everything going
on out there,

31:10.076 --> 31:11.662
do you really think that?

31:11.704 --> 31:13.831
[intercom buzzing]

31:13.872 --> 31:16.375
He's obviously not leaving.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.506
I can get rid of him,
but we have to let him up.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.883
We can't. Like, why
would we trust you?

31:25.801 --> 31:27.511
Think it through.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.638
He obviously saw the lights.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.516
If we don't answer,
he's gonna call it in.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.184
Where does that go?

31:34.226 --> 31:36.603
More cops surrounding the house.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.649
You think I want
my child caught in that?

31:44.611 --> 31:46.446
I'll convince him.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.365
[intercom buzzing]

31:49.616 --> 31:52.411
Fine, but, you let him in here,

31:52.452 --> 31:55.789
it's going to end very bad,
I will make sure of it.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.009
Hello?

32:08.051 --> 32:09.553

32:23.650 --> 32:25.193
Can I help you?

32:25.235 --> 32:27.696
Is everything okay, ma'am?
I was buzzing for a while.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.741
[Susan] Sorry, I was
out back on the phone.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.619
We're going door to door,
checking the neighborhood.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.789
It's a little late for
an open house.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.750
That ended at five.
[chuckling]

32:39.792 --> 32:43.796
Guess I just got drawn into
some work calls and emails.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.005
Lost track of time.

32:47.716 --> 32:50.928
Also, it's quieter here.
No kids.

[tense ominous music]

32:55.849 --> 32:58.894
Uh, I keep hearing sirens.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.395
Did something happen?

33:00.437 --> 33:02.773
There was a break-in
down the street.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.858
-Really?
-[officer sighing]

33:04.900 --> 33:06.693
It's not the first
that we've had lately.

33:06.735 --> 33:09.488
Seems to be the same pair that's
been doing this for months.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.949
Well, I hope no one was hurt.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.617
I'm afraid so.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.244
The intruders killed
the homeowner.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.497
Killed?

33:19.122 --> 33:21.917
From what we can tell,
he caught 'em in the act.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.961
We think he wounded one of them.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.882
Have you noticed anything
unusual tonight?

33:29.925 --> 33:31.677
Anyone you didn't recognize?

33:31.718 --> 33:35.514
Honestly, dozens of
people came through.

All strangers.

Yeah, um...
[chuckling]

33:56.284 --> 33:58.912
You're just kinda
freakin' me out a little.

33:59.538 --> 34:04.042
Uh, I am, I'm definitely gonna
go straight home, ASAP.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.752
That's a good idea.

34:05.794 --> 34:08.005
Just so you know,
the neighborhood's
been cordoned off,

34:08.046 --> 34:09.464
so you have to pass
through a police checkpoint

34:09.506 --> 34:11.090
on your way out.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.258
Checkpoint.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.844
Got it.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.679
Thank you for letting me know.

34:16.095 --> 34:17.848
-[Officer] You get home safe.
-[radio chatter]

34:17.890 --> 34:19.432
I will.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.018
You be safe out there.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.939
Hold on. Did you hurt yourself?

34:33.822 --> 34:35.448
[Susan chuckling]

34:35.490 --> 34:37.659
I am such a klutz.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.536

34:39.578 --> 34:43.206
I've been serving them all
day to potential buyers.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.124
You have no idea what
you have to do

34:45.166 --> 34:47.002
to entice buyers nowadays.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.590
I can make you one,
if you'd like.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.342
No, thank you, ma'am.
I'm on duty.

34:54.384 --> 34:57.303
Right. Duh. [chuckles]

34:57.345 --> 34:58.805
Get home safe.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.016
Make sure to close the
front gates after I leave.

You heard him.

35:24.163 --> 35:26.374
Police roadblocks.

That should hold until you
get real medical attention.

36:07.373 --> 36:10.460
[suspenseful tense music]

36:13.588 --> 36:15.007
What that cop said.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.635
You killed the owner
of that other house.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.680
Not me.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.348
She had to.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.893
But not before he
got a shot off.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.687
Lucky me, right?

36:28.728 --> 36:30.856
Luckier than him.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.650
No one was supposed
to come home.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.194
And there were never
guns. That was my rule.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.993
I open things.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.078
Safes, locks, security boxes.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.497
If it's locked,
I can get it open.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.790
But no guns.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.750
Not before today.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.046
I didn't even know she had one.

36:54.087 --> 36:56.882
Maybe she just didn't
bother to tell you about it.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.508
[tense ominous music]

36:58.550 --> 37:02.303
Listen to me, I know you
don't wanna believe it,

37:02.345 --> 37:05.598
this doesn't end
the way you think.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.268
This isn't just
a robbery anymore.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.855
It's murder.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.273
And now we've seen your faces.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.068
Do you really think she's
just gonna let us go?

37:16.109 --> 37:18.653
I told you that wasn't
supposed to happen,

37:18.695 --> 37:20.906
and we certainly don't
plan on adding to it.

37:22.115 --> 37:23.616
Like you said, how
much of tonight's

37:23.658 --> 37:25.577
gone according to the plan?

37:25.618 --> 37:28.163
Yeah. Okay, we'll wait
to hear from you.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.127
D confirmed what
the cop said, okay?

37:34.169 --> 37:36.213
All the surrounding roads
outside are blocked, so for now,

37:36.254 --> 37:38.548
we just sit tight
and stay chill.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.175
That's easy for him to say.

37:40.217 --> 37:42.385
He wasn't the one who was shot.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.889
Give him some time, okay?
He'll figure something out.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.682
Friend of yours?

37:47.724 --> 37:49.350
Would you shut up?

37:49.392 --> 37:50.643
You know what?

37:52.270 --> 37:54.564
I have to go to the bathroom.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.069
Fine.

37:59.111 --> 38:01.696
Come on.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.615
It's okay. I'll be fine.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.367
Let's go.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.619
Go!

38:15.168 --> 38:16.294
[suspenseful music]

38:16.335 --> 38:17.712
Leave it open.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.217
What, do you think I'm gonna
run and abandon my daughter?

38:23.093 --> 38:24.677
What mother would do that?

38:26.596 --> 38:28.389
It doesn't close.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.354
[sighing]

38:38.108 --> 38:41.527
Okay, let's see what
we can find out.

[keyboard clacks]

38:46.365 --> 38:48.201
It's not too late.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.620
Right now, you still
have options.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.623
Why don't you stop talking and
focus on what you're doing?

38:55.667 --> 38:58.878
There are better
choices you can make,

38:58.920 --> 39:01.047
before things get any worse.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.924
Better choices for you.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.594
And your baby.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.816
How did you know?

39:19.858 --> 39:22.401
You. Your reactions.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.655
A woman knows, especially a mom.

[Natalie chuckling]

39:27.365 --> 39:30.409
It wasn't exactly
part of our plan.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.205
That seems to be
the theme of the night.

39:36.166 --> 39:39.502
Look, being pregnant
is hard enough.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.088
The fear we carry for our kids,

39:42.130 --> 39:44.174
wanting to keep them safe.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.884
And on top of this?

I can't even imagine what
you're going through.

46:00.049 --> 46:02.510
You know, for the record,
if someone doesn't answer,

46:02.552 --> 46:04.803
wait for them to call you back.

46:04.845 --> 46:07.473
Otherwise, it's annoying.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.602
You're the home invasion thieves

46:10.643 --> 46:13.145
the police are looking for.

46:13.187 --> 46:15.856
Handsome and smart.
[chuckling]

46:15.898 --> 46:17.442
Okay.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.026
Let's talk.

46:19.068 --> 46:20.069
How much do you want?

46:20.111 --> 46:21.153
[scoffs]

46:22.280 --> 46:23.615
Wow. [scoffs]

46:23.656 --> 46:25.074
Blunt.

46:25.116 --> 46:27.118
Is that your winning
negotiating style, Paul?

46:27.159 --> 46:29.579
I like to think
it's direct,

46:29.621 --> 46:32.540
-and so far it's served me well.
-[tense ominous music]

46:32.582 --> 46:34.333
So what's it gonna cost?

46:34.375 --> 46:35.501
What are you doing?

46:35.543 --> 46:37.044
Negotiating.

46:37.086 --> 46:39.213
Watch and learn.

46:39.922 --> 46:40.881
Typical.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.300
Thinking you can just

46:42.341 --> 46:43.718
deal your way out
of any problem.

46:44.427 --> 46:47.764
Almost everything in
life is a negotiation.

46:47.804 --> 46:49.641
Certainly this is.

46:49.682 --> 46:53.852
You're thieves. So deep
down, you want money.

46:53.894 --> 46:57.982
You're only here because you
need somewhere to hide, right?

46:59.358 --> 47:03.655
That means none of us wants
to be here. Let's start there.

47:04.447 --> 47:07.824
What can we do to satisfy
both parties? Make an offer.

47:07.866 --> 47:09.118
Unbelievable.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.411
There's always
a deal to be made,

47:10.453 --> 47:11.746
a number! What is it?

47:13.539 --> 47:16.000
Or maybe there's not.

47:16.793 --> 47:22.632
-[suspenseful tense music]
-[Paul panting]

47:23.090 --> 47:26.385
Play this smart! I'm offering
you real money here!

47:26.427 --> 47:27.804
Cash in your pocket!

47:27.844 --> 47:29.681
Please, stop!

47:29.722 --> 47:32.057
There's a price for everything.
Name it!

47:32.099 --> 47:33.726
Is that so?

47:33.768 --> 47:37.355
Tell me, Paul. What's
the price for your life?

47:37.396 --> 47:38.606
50,000.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.067
Get us 50,000 and we'll go.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.319
Done!

47:46.739 --> 47:48.449
[tense music]

47:49.200 --> 47:51.910
What the hell are you doing?

47:51.952 --> 47:54.246
What you couldn't-- saving us.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.666
-You're welcome.
-You can't trust them.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.417
They killed someone.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.086
We've seen their faces.

48:01.128 --> 48:02.963
You really think they're
gonna let us go?

48:03.005 --> 48:05.341
For money? Yeah, I do.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.051
Even thieves have
a code of honor.

48:07.092 --> 48:08.720
Is that what you tell yourself?

48:08.761 --> 48:10.555
Let me give you a little
trade secret, Susan.

48:10.596 --> 48:12.682
There's always
a deal to be made.

48:12.724 --> 48:15.100
Maybe if you realized that,
you'd be better at your job.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.562
Maybe you wouldn't be
losing your house.

48:17.603 --> 48:18.730
Yeah.

48:19.146 --> 48:21.858
He's exactly how you
described him.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.736
[Natalie chuckling]

48:24.777 --> 48:25.820
Here's the problem, Paul.

48:25.862 --> 48:27.029
We've got more than that

48:27.071 --> 48:28.406
in the trunk of our car
downstairs.

48:29.906 --> 48:32.660
That's all I can transfer
without a delay of funds.

48:32.702 --> 48:34.412
And besides, are you
saying you couldn't use

48:34.453 --> 48:35.830
an extra $50,000?

48:36.581 --> 48:38.165
And what? You think
you're just gonna

48:38.207 --> 48:39.916
drive us out of here
that easy?

48:39.958 --> 48:41.586
That's exactly what I'll do.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.546
I'll tell the cops at the
checkpoint you're my clients

48:43.588 --> 48:46.173
and I was showing
you a property.

48:46.215 --> 48:47.508
At night?

48:47.550 --> 48:49.218
That won't be suspicious?

48:49.260 --> 48:50.553
It happens all the time.

48:50.595 --> 48:52.764
People wanna see the lights,
the view.

48:52.805 --> 48:55.683
[chuckling] Especially
a house like this.

48:55.725 --> 48:58.644
Once we're clear,
I'll transfer the money.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.479
You can even take my car,

49:00.521 --> 49:04.024
and we'd never have to
see each other again.

49:04.066 --> 49:07.612
[stammers] I'd appreciate it
if you leave it intact.

49:07.653 --> 49:08.987
It's a lease.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.073
[Natalie chuckling]

49:11.115 --> 49:13.785
Take the offer.
It gives you what you want.

49:13.826 --> 49:16.495
A safe way out
and money for the baby.

49:16.537 --> 49:19.998
[eerie suspenseful music]

49:24.462 --> 49:26.088
I need to make a call.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.715
Watch him.

49:29.759 --> 49:31.260
You didn't know.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.598
That's the second thing they
left you in the dark about.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.311
Okay, fine. You have a deal.

49:40.352 --> 49:42.396
-Let's move.
-[opens knife]

49:42.438 --> 49:44.816
You might wanna lose that shirt.

49:44.857 --> 49:46.776
There's a box of
clothes in my car.

49:46.818 --> 49:48.985
My husband's.
I was donating them.

49:49.027 --> 49:50.822
You might be able to
find something that fits.

49:51.572 --> 49:53.866
Yeah and get the rest of our
stuff while you're at it.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.498
[tense music]

50:00.539 --> 50:02.124
You're getting rid
of Dad's stuff?

50:04.376 --> 50:07.212
I was just...
cleaning things up.

50:08.172 --> 50:10.842
Sounds more like you
were clearing it out.

50:11.884 --> 50:14.512
He's not gonna need
them anymore, honey.

50:47.795 --> 50:49.797
Something wrong?

50:49.839 --> 50:52.591
That was one of
his favorite shirts.

50:53.384 --> 50:54.719
Thank you.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.595
Okay.

50:56.637 --> 50:58.014
Say goodbye.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.058
[opens knife]

51:03.019 --> 51:05.938
[tense music]

51:05.980 --> 51:08.566
I'll be back as soon
as they set me free.

51:09.775 --> 51:11.318
I'll be okay.

51:23.121 --> 51:25.123
This is how I like
to do business.

51:25.165 --> 51:28.961
With people who have clear
goals and don't play games.

51:29.003 --> 51:31.213
Honey, swivel your chair around.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.298
-[suspenseful music]
-Back to back, just do it.

51:39.013 --> 51:42.098
-When were you gonna tell me?
-About what?

51:42.140 --> 51:43.726
About the house and selling it?

51:43.768 --> 51:45.937
I didn't want you to
find out this way.

51:46.729 --> 51:48.188
I saw the flyer on your laptop.

51:48.230 --> 51:49.273
Were you even gonna tell me?

51:49.314 --> 51:50.315
Of course!

51:50.357 --> 51:51.859
Now is not the time.

51:51.901 --> 51:53.819
We have bigger things to
worry about right now.

51:53.861 --> 51:55.821
Might be our only time.

51:55.863 --> 51:58.908
Don't talk like that.
We're gonna be okay.

51:58.950 --> 52:01.159
We don't know that.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.621
We will if I have
anything to say about it.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.039
Get closer.

52:11.712 --> 52:12.797
Yeah.

52:12.838 --> 52:15.173
Hang on.

52:15.215 --> 52:18.552
-He wants to talk to you.

52:23.139 --> 52:24.934
That wasn't our agreement.

52:24.976 --> 52:29.063
<i>Consider this a renegotiation.</i>
<i>Transfer the money.</i>

52:30.146 --> 52:32.650
I'm sorry, but those
terms are unacceptable.

52:32.691 --> 52:34.485
Once I get us past
the checkpoint,

52:34.526 --> 52:37.029
I'll make the transfer
as we agreed.

52:37.071 --> 52:38.154
I'm good for it.

52:38.196 --> 52:40.365
[D]<i> Transfer the money now.</i>

52:40.407 --> 52:41.492
I'm not going to do that.

52:41.533 --> 52:42.576
If you'll just abide by

52:42.618 --> 52:44.078
our original agreement.

Yes. [grunts]

53:02.513 --> 53:06.558
How do I know you won't kill
me after I make the transfer?

That's not good.

53:44.555 --> 53:47.265
On the north end of the
property, there's a side gate.

53:47.307 --> 53:49.518
It empties out into
a drainage ditch.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.603
You get free,
you run for it.

53:52.228 --> 53:53.480
Mom, no.

Do what I tell you.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.545
You're how they knew who to rob.

59:08.586 --> 59:11.756
Who was home,
who was on vacation.

59:11.798 --> 59:13.425
Who owned things worth stealing.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.553
Everybody's gotta have
a side gig these days.

59:16.594 --> 59:17.971
[car engine starts]

59:26.021 --> 59:28.982
[suspenseful music]

59:31.735 --> 59:32.986
[car door slams]

59:33.028 --> 59:35.655
You're lucky I was
on duty tonight.

59:36.156 --> 59:37.574
Here.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.878
You shouldn't have run.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.509
Out.

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:02.766
Where's Paul?

1:00:06.061 --> 1:00:08.439
[handcuffs clicking]

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:10.399
Get 'em inside!

1:00:19.408 --> 1:00:20.867
[tense ominous music]

1:00:22.994 --> 1:00:24.871
How could you do this?

1:00:24.913 --> 1:00:28.666
These people pay you
to protect them.

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:31.378
I do protect them.

1:00:31.420 --> 1:00:34.590
I make sure they're not home
when we break into the place.

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:36.258
Until today, you mean.

1:00:37.759 --> 1:00:39.303
Mm.

1:00:39.344 --> 1:00:41.179
That was unfortunate.

1:00:42.639 --> 1:00:44.849
But they pay me...

1:00:46.393 --> 1:00:48.395
to protect this.

1:00:48.437 --> 1:00:50.188
Their stuff.

1:00:52.232 --> 1:00:55.319
I've worked here
for five years?

1:00:56.403 --> 1:00:58.530
Five.

1:00:58.572 --> 1:01:01.658
How many of these residents
do you think know my name?

1:01:03.201 --> 1:01:04.620
I'll tell ya--

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.037
three.

1:01:07.498 --> 1:01:08.624
Mm.

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:10.417
The rest of them

1:01:10.459 --> 1:01:12.669
barely make eye contact.

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:14.712
Do you know why?

1:01:14.754 --> 1:01:17.549
Because on the
rare occasion

1:01:17.591 --> 1:01:20.344
that they do bother
to look at me,

1:01:20.385 --> 1:01:23.639
they see me as beneath them.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.682
Some blue-collar schlub

1:01:25.723 --> 1:01:29.561
they don't even deem
worthy to acknowledge.

1:01:29.603 --> 1:01:34.566
Do you know how many
weekends I have spent

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:37.528
doing odd jobs

1:01:37.569 --> 1:01:39.655
on the side for these people?

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:43.908
Hanging holidays lights
or fixing gutters?

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:48.788
And every time, every time!

1:01:48.830 --> 1:01:50.332
They complain.

1:01:50.374 --> 1:01:53.335
They try to pay less
than we agreed upon.

1:01:53.377 --> 1:01:56.588
Renegotiating the price,
after the job is done.

1:01:56.630 --> 1:02:00.509
Trying to skimp out on the bill
and screw the little guy.

1:02:00.551 --> 1:02:03.803
So that makes it all right
to take what's not yours?

1:02:03.845 --> 1:02:05.722
I'm taking what they owe me.

1:02:05.763 --> 1:02:08.808
Besides, this is all insured.

1:02:08.850 --> 1:02:10.477
Replaceable.

1:02:10.935 --> 1:02:12.521
[chuckles]

1:02:13.355 --> 1:02:15.982
These people can stand
to learn a lesson or two.

1:02:16.024 --> 1:02:18.402
So what lesson do you
think you're teaching them?

1:02:18.443 --> 1:02:21.738
That they have way more
than they'll ever need.

1:02:21.779 --> 1:02:24.616
And physical things
don't matter.

1:02:24.658 --> 1:02:27.035
If they don't matter then
why are you stealing them?

1:02:28.662 --> 1:02:31.206
From the mouth of
a suburban princess.

1:02:34.626 --> 1:02:36.378
Tell me, what Ivy
League university

1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:38.129
will you be attending this year?

1:02:38.171 --> 1:02:40.632
You don't know
anything about me.

1:02:40.674 --> 1:02:42.926
I know your type.

1:02:42.967 --> 1:02:44.928
I get ignored by them every day.

1:02:46.221 --> 1:02:49.266
They turn away without
even bothering to wave.

1:02:49.307 --> 1:02:52.102
Maybe that's because
they think you're a creep.

1:02:54.812 --> 1:02:56.398
I can be real sweet.

1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:59.568
-Get your hands off of her!
-[Darren chuckling]

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:00.985
You don't know us.

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:02.487
You're just lumping us
into your story

1:03:02.529 --> 1:03:04.406
to make things easier for you.

1:03:04.448 --> 1:03:06.991
[police dispatch]
<i>Unit seven, do you copy?</i>

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:09.620
Hold that thought.

1:03:10.370 --> 1:03:11.788
[eerie music]

1:03:11.829 --> 1:03:12.830
[static hisses]

1:03:13.206 --> 1:03:15.041
-Dispatch--
-Help! Help us!

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:18.503
If she does that again,

1:03:18.545 --> 1:03:22.340
give her something to
really scream about.

1:03:22.382 --> 1:03:24.426
[police dispatch]
<i>Unit seven, everything okay?</i>

1:03:24.468 --> 1:03:26.094
[ominous music]

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:27.804
[static hisses]

1:03:27.845 --> 1:03:28.680
Dispatch, this is
unit seven.

1:03:28.722 --> 1:03:30.098
Sorry about that.

1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:31.975
Got a little bit
of a squelch there.

1:03:32.016 --> 1:03:35.562
Uh, all clear on my side.
I am still out on patrol.

1:03:35.604 --> 1:03:37.230
Though I don't
exactly know why

1:03:37.272 --> 1:03:38.690
with all these
cops cars around.

1:03:38.732 --> 1:03:39.983
[dispatch]
<i>Don't get too comfy.</i>

1:03:40.024 --> 1:03:41.485
<i>We just got word</i>
<i>the police</i>

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:43.194
<i>are expanding</i>
<i>their search area.</i>

1:03:43.236 --> 1:03:45.656
<i>Barricades are coming</i>
<i>down within the hour.</i>

1:03:45.697 --> 1:03:47.282
I guess we're going
back to work then.

1:03:47.324 --> 1:03:48.492
Let me know when
they're all clear.

1:03:48.533 --> 1:03:49.743
Over.

1:03:51.911 --> 1:03:54.456
Looks like we're out of
here sooner than we thought.

1:03:55.707 --> 1:03:57.542
Let's get this mess cleaned up.

1:04:02.088 --> 1:04:05.925
[tense music]

1:04:09.554 --> 1:04:12.015
-Not bad for a day's work.
-Yeah?

1:04:12.056 --> 1:04:13.642
You're not sporting
a bullet hole.

1:04:13.684 --> 1:04:16.394
There are always risks.
We knew that.

1:04:16.436 --> 1:04:18.104
Not like this.

1:04:18.146 --> 1:04:19.897
Not before today.

1:04:19.939 --> 1:04:21.566
You said no one would be home.

1:04:21.608 --> 1:04:23.401
There wasn't supposed to be.

1:04:23.443 --> 1:04:26.363
And him owning a gun? You
didn't know about that either?

1:04:26.404 --> 1:04:27.905
It must've been new.

1:04:27.947 --> 1:04:29.700
It's not like they tell
me everything.

1:04:29.741 --> 1:04:31.242
I know how that feels.

1:04:33.662 --> 1:04:35.288
Something on your mind?

1:04:36.289 --> 1:04:38.041
Natalie?

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:39.292
The guns?

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:42.504
It was a precaution.

1:04:42.546 --> 1:04:44.881
And I'd say you're
pretty lucky she had it.

1:04:44.922 --> 1:04:48.092
No weapons.
That was our agreement.

1:04:48.968 --> 1:04:50.470
That was my rule.

1:04:51.095 --> 1:04:52.806
Yeah, well your rule had
to go out the window,

1:04:52.848 --> 1:04:55.975
in order to score
something this big.

1:04:56.017 --> 1:05:00.271
You wanna raise the score,
we had to up our game.

1:05:00.313 --> 1:05:02.524
That comes with risks.

1:05:02.566 --> 1:05:04.317
Besides, what difference
would it have made?

1:05:04.359 --> 1:05:06.778
-I'd have quit.
-[scoffs]

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:08.446
This wasn't part of the plan.

1:05:09.364 --> 1:05:12.200
Once we get out of this,
I take my cut and I'm out.

1:05:13.201 --> 1:05:15.203
You two can go form
your happy family.

1:05:17.288 --> 1:05:18.874
Oh, yeah.

1:05:18.915 --> 1:05:21.334
There's something else you
forgot to tell me about.

1:05:35.849 --> 1:05:39.853
[somber orchestral music]

1:05:40.353 --> 1:05:43.231
You should've told me
about the house.

1:05:43.273 --> 1:05:45.149
I wanted to.

1:05:45.191 --> 1:05:47.318
I just didn't know how.

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:49.153
I was gonna tell you
at dinner tonight.

1:05:49.195 --> 1:05:51.281
That's why you're
rushing me out.

1:05:51.322 --> 1:05:52.908
I just thought it
might be easier

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:56.661
when you were settled at
school, with a new life.

1:05:57.287 --> 1:05:59.038
Then it might hurt less.

1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:02.375
After everything we've been
through, I just wanted you

1:06:02.417 --> 1:06:05.462
to hold onto being a teenager
for a little longer.

1:06:06.504 --> 1:06:08.423
[door closing]

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:12.093
This house has some nice stuff.
[chuckling]

1:06:18.099 --> 1:06:19.350
Relax.

1:06:19.392 --> 1:06:20.727
It's almost over.

1:06:20.769 --> 1:06:22.270
Are you sure about that?

1:06:23.730 --> 1:06:26.733
-[door closing]
-[ominous music]

1:06:26.775 --> 1:06:28.359
We should take one
of them with us,

1:06:28.401 --> 1:06:30.654
in case we run into any trouble.

1:06:30.695 --> 1:06:33.239
No. That was never in the plan.

1:06:33.281 --> 1:06:34.783
Plans change.

1:06:34.825 --> 1:06:37.327
Besides, we need one
of them for insurance.

1:06:39.078 --> 1:06:40.455
I said no.

1:06:42.749 --> 1:06:44.626
Okay.

1:06:44.668 --> 1:06:46.043
We'll put it to a vote.

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:49.213
So far we have one
for and one against.

1:06:49.756 --> 1:06:51.382
Baby, you're up.

1:06:57.472 --> 1:06:59.390
It's just a precaution.

1:06:59.432 --> 1:07:02.644
Like I said, it's gonna be
fine. They're for insurance.

1:07:02.686 --> 1:07:05.522
Okay. Yeah, no, let's take one.

1:07:05.563 --> 1:07:08.733
Good. It's all settled then.

1:07:08.775 --> 1:07:11.277
Take me.

1:07:11.319 --> 1:07:16.700
See, I'm gonna go with her,
because that way I know

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:19.995
you're not gonna do
anything to jeopardize us.

1:07:20.036 --> 1:07:21.412
[Keith] We don't need her!

1:07:23.707 --> 1:07:25.876
You were outvoted.

1:07:25.917 --> 1:07:27.544
Baby, help me wipe down the car.

1:07:36.052 --> 1:07:41.892
-[Keith sighing]
-[dark music]

1:07:41.933 --> 1:07:45.020
You have to let us go,
before they come back.

1:07:45.061 --> 1:07:48.523
We'll speak on your
behalf, say you helped us.

1:07:48.565 --> 1:07:50.274
I can't.

1:07:50.316 --> 1:07:52.109
What do you think's
about to happen?

1:07:52.777 --> 1:07:55.321
This is about to get very bad.

1:07:55.363 --> 1:07:57.866
Trust me, I know when
a deal's gone south.

1:07:57.908 --> 1:07:59.325
I've had my share.

1:07:59.367 --> 1:08:00.869
I'll protect her.

1:08:02.662 --> 1:08:04.497
I'll keep her safe. I promise.

1:08:04.539 --> 1:08:08.209
You're not even safe.
It's two against one!

1:08:10.211 --> 1:08:11.880
Think about it.
Think about everything

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:13.256
that's gone wrong tonight.

1:08:13.965 --> 1:08:15.299
Do you really think

1:08:15.341 --> 1:08:17.385
he didn't know the owner
would come home?

1:08:17.427 --> 1:08:19.095
-[sighs]
-I...

1:08:19.596 --> 1:08:20.805
Why would he lie?

1:08:20.847 --> 1:08:21.973
You tell me.

1:08:22.390 --> 1:08:23.808
What's changed since then?

1:08:23.850 --> 1:08:25.476
What else didn't they
tell you about?

1:08:26.185 --> 1:08:30.273
They have something to fight
for. Each other, their baby.

1:08:31.066 --> 1:08:32.859
Where does that leave you?

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:36.905
-[fire crackling]
-[tense music]

1:08:36.947 --> 1:08:39.198
Why didn't you finish
him at the house, huh?

1:08:39.699 --> 1:08:41.200
Let the cops find him.

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:43.411
That was the plan,
remember? Close the loop.

1:08:43.453 --> 1:08:44.662
Yeah, I know!

1:08:44.704 --> 1:08:46.081
It's bad enough that the cops

1:08:46.122 --> 1:08:47.874
already suspect
neighborhood security.

1:08:47.916 --> 1:08:50.543
What did you want me to do,
okay? The plans changed.

1:08:50.585 --> 1:08:54.672
The owner came home like
you said, but he had a gun.

1:08:54.714 --> 1:08:57.884
I-- I-- I panicked, okay? I...

1:08:57.926 --> 1:08:59.302
I was terrified.

1:09:01.345 --> 1:09:03.723
Keith saved me, okay?

1:09:03.765 --> 1:09:05.725
Saved us.

1:09:06.684 --> 1:09:08.436
I'm sorry.

1:09:08.478 --> 1:09:10.438
It's okay, all right?

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:13.316
It's fine. It's fine.

1:09:14.692 --> 1:09:17.070
Come here, come here, come here.

1:09:18.237 --> 1:09:20.657
I'll fix it, okay?

1:09:21.074 --> 1:09:22.533
I always fix it.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:24.911
Look, we are running
out of time.

1:09:25.996 --> 1:09:28.581
You don't believe me?
Find out for yourself.

1:09:28.623 --> 1:09:31.668
[ominous tones]

1:09:45.682 --> 1:09:47.684
They're not there, are they?

1:09:57.861 --> 1:09:59.863
<i>There's still a way out</i>
<i>of this for us, okay?</i>

1:09:59.904 --> 1:10:03.366
<i>Keith's blood is all</i>
<i>over that crime scene.</i>

1:10:03.407 --> 1:10:07.411
<i>So he fled, came here</i>
<i>to hide out, took hostages,</i>

1:10:07.453 --> 1:10:10.331
<i>and when I came across him,</i>
<i>I shot him in self-defense.</i>

1:10:11.374 --> 1:10:12.792
What about the others?

1:10:12.834 --> 1:10:15.045
Casualties.

1:10:15.086 --> 1:10:16.838
Two innocents.

Look, I'm not crazy
about it either,

1:10:25.471 --> 1:10:28.058

way out of this for us.

1:10:28.099 --> 1:10:29.851
You know that.

1:10:29.893 --> 1:10:31.102
There can't be any witnesses.

1:10:31.144 --> 1:10:33.980
Nobody to contradict our story.

1:10:34.022 --> 1:10:35.356
This is the only way.

1:10:37.608 --> 1:10:39.819
This gives us a chance.

1:10:43.573 --> 1:10:45.825
It gives our family a chance.

1:10:51.081 --> 1:10:52.874
All right.

You're sure you can do this?

1:11:24.447 --> 1:11:25.406
Yeah.

1:11:25.448 --> 1:11:26.741
Okay.

1:11:26.783 --> 1:11:28.325
So I'll ask Keith to help me...

1:11:29.285 --> 1:11:30.745
get him away from the others...

1:11:33.456 --> 1:11:34.958
this may get messy.

1:11:37.501 --> 1:11:38.711
