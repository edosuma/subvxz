This is the story of the true
meaning of Christmas,

00:11.045 --> 00:12.280
the story of a boy--

00:12.280 --> 00:15.083
well, an emotionally stunted
man--

00:15.083 --> 00:18.286
who had gotten himself
into quite a pickle.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.956
Adam, you were supposed
to get the place ready.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.392
You didn't do anything.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.393
Yes, I did.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.128
I found our old
Christmas tape.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.429
Want to watch it?
No.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.064
Look, it's Christmas Eve.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.133
This place
has to be perfect.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.135
It's fine.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.969
Mom and Dad are gonna
be here in a few hours.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.106
You know how nuts they get
about tradition.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.973
I spent the last month
making eggnog

00:39.973 --> 00:41.709
even though
I'm lactose intolerant.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.244
I have to roast chestnuts
over an open fire

00:43.244 --> 00:45.079
even though it breaks
like 15 fire codes.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.248
And I have 900 yards
of popcorn garland to make

00:47.248 --> 00:50.451
because Mom always says,
"Jesus weeps without popcorn."

00:50.451 --> 00:52.120
(sighs) It really
means a lot to me

00:52.120 --> 00:53.287
that they finally
agreed to have

00:53.287 --> 00:54.922
Christmas Eve
at my place,

00:54.922 --> 00:56.390
but the last thing I want
is another fight

00:56.390 --> 00:57.758
about how we're not
celebrating Jesus

00:57.758 --> 00:58.792
like in the old days.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.094
Ooh, in the old days,

01:00.094 --> 01:01.262
people used to fight
about putting Christ

01:01.262 --> 01:03.097
in Christmas
just as much.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.999
In fact--
Oh, no, we do not have time
for your show right now.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.502
Not my show,
my Christmas special.

Look, I know we're not
that religious,

01:29.190 --> 01:30.691
but Mom and Dad
made it a tradition.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.293
It's the one night a year
we get together

01:32.293 --> 01:34.462
and have a nice, somber
Christiany evening.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.197
Well, that's pretty weird

01:36.197 --> 01:38.098
because historically,
Christmas was actually

01:38.098 --> 01:39.933
a really raucous holiday,

01:39.933 --> 01:41.502
and most of our
Christmas traditions

01:41.502 --> 01:43.971
have really
un-Christian origins.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.974
Here, I'll show you.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.642
Ugh! Animated, really?

01:48.642 --> 01:50.478
I don't have time
for this.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.513
But I always did relate
to Peppermint Patty, Chuck.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.348
The real story
of the holiday season

01:54.348 --> 01:56.484
starts over
2,000 years ago

01:56.484 --> 01:58.686
during the Roman Empire.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.521
In December, Romans
celebrated a holiday

02:00.521 --> 02:01.822
called Saturnalia

02:01.822 --> 02:03.991
to mark the end
of the harvest.

02:03.991 --> 02:04.992
It was a wild party

02:04.992 --> 02:06.327
involving gambling,
singing,

02:06.327 --> 02:07.995
and even
cross-dressing.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.663
Isn't there anyone

02:09.663 --> 02:13.467
who knows what Saturnalia
is all about?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.502
And in northern Europe,

02:14.502 --> 02:16.337
a drunken festival
called Yule

02:16.337 --> 02:18.406
celebrated the birth
of the sun.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.407
Families would burn

02:19.407 --> 02:20.808
the biggest log
they could find

02:20.808 --> 02:23.043
and celebrate
around evergreen trees

02:23.043 --> 02:24.912
to ward off
winter depression.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.180
I hate to burst
your bubble, Chuck,

02:26.180 --> 02:28.182
but this has nothing
to do with Christmas.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.851
December 25 is still
Jesus's birthday.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.853
Actually, no one
really knows for certain

02:32.853 --> 02:34.087
when Jesus was born,

02:34.087 --> 02:35.889
but we do know
that when Christianity

02:35.889 --> 02:37.658
took hold of Europe
in the fifth century,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.393
some common folk
refused to part

02:39.393 --> 02:40.894
with these pagan parties,

02:40.894 --> 02:43.231
so Christian leaders
gradually transformed

02:43.231 --> 02:44.532
these popular traditions

02:44.532 --> 02:46.900
into a celebration
of Jesus's birth.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.536
Hey, you pagan freaks,

02:48.536 --> 02:51.205
my God was probably
born today.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.874
This party's
about Jesus now, 'kay?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.543
Whatever, dude.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.848
Inserting Christ into
these winter festivals

03:00.848 --> 03:02.750
was basically
a civic compromise--

03:02.750 --> 03:04.252
make the party
about Jesus

03:04.252 --> 03:06.119
and you can keep
getting jiggy with it.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.721
Well, Chuck, sounds like
that's when Christmas

03:07.721 --> 03:09.223
became the nice,
family-friendly holiday

03:09.223 --> 03:10.891
we know today.
Nope.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.060
It stayed a debauched,
violent booze fest

03:13.060 --> 03:14.795
for a long time.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.063
For over
a thousand years,

03:16.063 --> 03:19.467
Christmas was more like
a terrifying Mardi Gras.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.237
In England, drunken mobs
would take over the streets,

03:23.237 --> 03:26.907
and a beggar would be crowned
the lord of misrule.

03:26.907 --> 03:30.611
I declare
all crime is legal.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.080
It's purge time, baby!

03:33.080 --> 03:35.082
(Adam)
The mobs would bang
on rich people's doors

03:35.082 --> 03:36.149
and demand to be served

03:36.149 --> 03:37.785
the best food and drink
they had,

03:37.785 --> 03:38.919
and if they refused,

03:38.919 --> 03:41.255
they were threatened
with Christmas violence.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.424
Give me booze,
or I'll smash your face!

03:43.424 --> 03:45.058
This actually looks
kind of fun, Chuck.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.095
I agree, but it certainly
wasn't very Christian,

03:48.095 --> 03:50.264
which is why, when Puritans
came to America,

03:50.264 --> 03:52.266
they decided Christmas
had no place

03:52.266 --> 03:53.567
in a Christian nation

03:53.567 --> 03:54.835
and banned it.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.104
What? Christmas
was illegal?
Yep.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.238
In some communities,

03:58.238 --> 03:59.840
if you exhibited
Christmas spirit,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.310
you were even forced
to pay a fine.

04:02.310 --> 04:06.013
Hmm, rosy cheeks,
jolly smile.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.982

is five shillings...

04:15.122 --> 04:16.957
Thanks to the legacy
of these rules,

04:16.957 --> 04:19.693
Christmas ended up pretty
unpopular in America,

04:19.693 --> 04:22.630
but all that changed
in the 19th century.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.298
As immigrants
flooded into America,

04:24.298 --> 04:26.099
they brought with them
a love of Christmas

04:26.099 --> 04:27.668
and their own
traditions.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.937
These seeped into
the popular culture,

04:29.937 --> 04:31.872
and a new,
American Christmas

04:31.872 --> 04:33.140
began to take hold.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.508
And now we
treat Christmas

04:34.508 --> 04:37.978
like it's always been a sacred
Christian celebration,

04:37.978 --> 04:39.480
but the historical
truth is,

04:39.480 --> 04:41.815
these winter festivities
have pagan roots

04:41.815 --> 04:43.050
with drunken traditions

04:43.050 --> 04:45.118
that a lot of Christians
straight up hated

04:45.118 --> 04:47.488
for like
a thousand years.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.656
Now, look,

04:48.656 --> 04:50.724
celebrating Christmas
as the birth of Jesus

04:50.724 --> 04:52.460
is a wonderful tradition,

04:52.460 --> 04:54.194
but it's just as
historically accurate

04:54.194 --> 04:55.496
to get drunk
in the woods

04:55.496 --> 04:56.964
or bang on
a rich person's door

04:56.964 --> 04:58.699
and threaten them
with violence.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.833
So, instead of worrying

04:59.833 --> 05:01.969
that Christmas
isn't Christian anymore,

05:01.969 --> 05:03.236
why don't we just
let people celebrate

05:03.236 --> 05:05.573
the way they want?

05:05.573 --> 05:06.807
Great.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.676
Isn't it always better
to know? (chuckles)

05:08.676 --> 05:10.378
Well, I know that you just
wasted seven minutes of my time

05:10.378 --> 05:12.045
and this place isn't even
close to being ready,

05:12.045 --> 05:13.381
so why don't you
give me a hand

05:13.381 --> 05:15.349
and wrap some
Christmas gifts.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.850

05:16.850 --> 05:19.019
Oh, I definitely can't
help you with those.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.855
Why not?
Because they make
no economic sense.

Hey, guys.
I am so sorry.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.959
We're the examples
this time.

06:31.959 --> 06:35.062
First, let's define
economic value.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.329
I'd rather drown.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.932
The value of an object
is the maximum amount

06:38.932 --> 06:40.834
that its owner would be
willing to pay for it,

06:40.834 --> 06:43.504
or simply put, how much
it's worth to you.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.974
Add all these
amounts together,

06:46.974 --> 06:48.742
and that's
the total value

06:48.742 --> 06:50.678
of everything
you've bought.

06:50.678 --> 06:51.979
Ohh!

06:51.979 --> 06:53.280
Cool.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.848
Oh, Emily,
I see that giant

06:54.848 --> 06:56.016
cardboard cutout
of The Rock

06:56.016 --> 06:57.585
is worth a hundred
bucks to you.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.586
Oh, yeah.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.488
But I only paid
50 for it.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.155
Well, it it's worth
a hundred to you

07:02.155 --> 07:03.791
and you only paid 50,

07:03.791 --> 07:05.459
then in economic terms,
when you bought it,

07:05.459 --> 07:09.196
you literally created
$50 in value.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.464
You're 50 bucks richer.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.365
Oh, I feel wealthy.

for this lesson

07:15.202 --> 07:16.504
in basic economics,

07:16.504 --> 07:18.205
but what does this have
to do with gift-giving?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.507
(man)
A whole lot, actually.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.710

Hey, Adam.
Hey, Joel.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.821
Would you mind explaining
to my sister Rhea

07:33.821 --> 07:36.056
what the economic problem
with gift-giving is?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.057
Sure.
When we buy gifts,

07:37.057 --> 07:38.959
we do so with
the best of intentions,

07:38.959 --> 07:41.495
but while we're really good
at knowing what we like,

07:41.495 --> 07:42.730
we're pretty terrible
at guessing

07:42.730 --> 07:44.665
what other people
would value.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.967
Oh, this is great.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.468
What? What's wrong?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.571
Well, usually I wear
wrestling tank tops

07:50.571 --> 07:52.239
so I can show off
my jacked triceps,

07:52.239 --> 07:53.574
but it's the thought
that counts.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.908
Not economically.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.210
Emily, how much would you
pay for this shirt?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.378
I'll wear it to bed,
so I guess, like,

07:58.378 --> 08:00.681
I don't know, 15 bucks.
I paid 50.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.851
(Joel)
Well, Murph, you just destroyed
$35 worth of value.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.386
He might as well
have set it on fire.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.388
No. No, no, no, no!

08:08.388 --> 08:10.057
Now, sometimes
we get it right

08:10.057 --> 08:11.659
and buy
the perfect gift,

08:11.659 --> 08:12.860
but on average,

08:12.860 --> 08:15.696
gifts are worth 18% less
per dollar spent

08:15.696 --> 08:16.697
to their recipients

08:16.697 --> 08:18.766
than things we buy
for ourselves.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.569
And statistically, spouses are
actually the best gift-givers.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.937
You know who's worse?
Parents.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.606
(man)
Dear Daughter,
we know you like The Rock,

08:25.606 --> 08:27.608
so we got you
his cousin's DVD.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.009
It cost us 50 bucks.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.243
Ugh!

08:30.243 --> 08:32.445
"Roman Reigns" is trash.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.447
I mean, I guess maybe
I'd spend like $2 on it,

08:34.447 --> 08:36.083
but only to hate-watch it.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.586
(Joel)
That's $48 in value destroyed.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.120
(Adam)
And according
to Joel's research,

08:40.120 --> 08:43.290
there's not much worse
than the dreaded aunt.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.759
Well, you said you liked rock,
so here's a rock.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.227
(grunting)

08:47.227 --> 08:49.296
It cost $50.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.564
This is a nothing gift.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.299
This is worth
literally nothing to me.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.300
(Adam)
Poof!

08:53.300 --> 08:55.903
$50 in value
just evaporated.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.470
Please leave.
You smell like incense.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.572
(Adam snaps fingers)

08:58.572 --> 08:59.773
And when you add up
the waste

08:59.773 --> 09:02.109
across all the gifts
in the economy,

09:02.109 --> 09:05.145
we're destroying more than
$20 billion per year.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.479
(Rhea)
So, what's your
takeaway here?

09:06.479 --> 09:07.981
Do we stop
giving gifts?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.583
No.
No one wants that.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.785
But we can all give
a lot smarter.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.553
We should just be extra
careful in those situations

09:13.553 --> 09:14.822
where we're giving
to people

09:14.822 --> 09:16.456
whose preferences
we don't know.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.091
And we can make
more use of tools

09:18.091 --> 09:20.260
like online wish lists
and gift cards

09:20.260 --> 09:21.328
that enable
the recipient

09:21.328 --> 09:23.263
to pick the gift
that they want.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.331
That way,
we can all have

09:24.331 --> 09:26.900
a more economically
efficient holiday.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.901
Wow.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.236
How joyous.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.271
Actually, gift cards
have their own problems.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.106
Nope, you only
get one. Out.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.443
Happy Christmas to all
and to all a good Q4.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.911
Ah, I'll use the door
this time.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.647
Bye, Joel.
Man, that guy's cool.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.082
Adam, again, I don't know
why you felt the need

09:42.082 --> 09:43.817
to tell me this today.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.986
I told you, it's always
better to know.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.120
Okay, you keep
saying that,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.689
and our parents
are coming,

09:48.689 --> 09:51.158
and I don't know
how to talk to you.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.793
All I wanted
was your help today,

09:52.793 --> 09:54.427
and you just keep telling me
pointless trivia.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.030
You always do this.
What is the point of it?

09:57.030 --> 09:58.866
I was just trying to show you
that if you freed yourself--

09:58.866 --> 09:59.967
Enough!

09:59.967 --> 10:02.269
I have been dealing
with this for months!

10:02.269 --> 10:05.338
All I asked of you was to be
out of my house by Christmas.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.874
I just wanted to show
Mom and Dad

10:06.874 --> 10:08.608
I'm a functioning adult.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.343
You are
a functioning adult.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.379
Well, you're not!

10:12.379 --> 10:14.214
You just get in the way.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.216
Which way to the bus?

10:16.216 --> 10:17.517
Oh, um--

10:17.517 --> 10:19.452
You don't have
to take the bus.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.721
I'm sorry.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.558
I thought your powers
were only for learning.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.060
They are.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.562
I just learned something
about myself.

10:33.734 --> 10:37.705
("Silent Night" playing)

10:37.705 --> 10:41.508
(narrator)
In his life, Adam had often
felt lonely,

10:41.508 --> 10:45.045
but never quite as lonely
as he felt now--

10:45.045 --> 10:48.982
all by himself
on Christmas Eve.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.019
His sister had helped him
when he needed it most,

10:52.019 --> 10:56.389
but like always,
he ruined that too,

10:56.389 --> 10:59.893
and now he had no one.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.729
Or did he?

11:01.729 --> 11:02.996
Adam.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.699
Hey, don't worry about it.
It's okay.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.936
No, it really isn't
this time.

11:08.936 --> 11:12.372
My sister let me
crash with her all year,

11:12.372 --> 11:13.406
and I wanted to say
thank you,

11:13.406 --> 11:16.243
but I couldn't even
do that right.

11:16.243 --> 11:19.713
I'm just not like
everybody else.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.182
Adam, when I
first met you,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.617
I thought you were
some smug nerd

11:24.617 --> 11:25.853
in a tweed jacket

11:25.853 --> 11:28.255
who needed to be
right all the time,

11:28.255 --> 11:30.590
but when I got
to know you,

11:30.590 --> 11:32.926
I realized you were
just trying to help

11:32.926 --> 11:35.362
in the only way
you know how.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.365
So, now, the fact
that you're different,

11:38.365 --> 11:40.600
that's what I like
about you.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.770
I don't know,
Rhea was just so stressed,

11:42.770 --> 11:45.773
and I had this whole plan
to fix everything,

11:45.773 --> 11:47.941
and it didn't work.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.542
Well, not yet.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.979
But she's your sister,
and she loves you.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.947
It's not too late.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.583
Look, you have
a crazy ability

11:56.583 --> 11:59.652
to change people's minds
in like seven minutes.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.956
I bet you can change
Rhea's mind too.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.124
Yeah?

12:04.124 --> 12:05.625
Yeah!

12:05.625 --> 12:07.560
Go say thank you

12:07.560 --> 12:11.231
in whatever different
Adam way you can.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.636
(chuckling)

12:16.636 --> 12:19.807
You're right.
You're right!

12:19.807 --> 12:21.909
I know exactly
what I should do.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.444
I'm gonna tell her
the true story of Santa Claus.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.080
(chuckling)

12:27.080 --> 12:28.982
All right, that's not
the tactic I had in mind,

12:28.982 --> 12:30.650
but okay, sure.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.820
How'd I do?
Did it look real?

12:32.820 --> 12:33.954
You did great, honey.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.688
Now, let's go
get nooched.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.860
(smoke detector beeping)

12:39.860 --> 12:41.829
Ohh!

12:41.829 --> 12:43.163
Rhea...

12:43.163 --> 12:44.497
I know you don't
want to hear

12:44.497 --> 12:45.632
anything from me
right now,

12:45.632 --> 12:47.667
but this is
important.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.503
No, Mom and Dad are gonna
be here in 15 minutes.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.671
Please, I need
to tell you

12:51.671 --> 12:53.841
the true history
of Santa Claus.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.142
Just hear me out.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.877
Whatever. Go ahead.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.278
But I already
know this one.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.147
Santa was invented
by Coca-Cola.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.982
Nope. In the early
20th century,

13:01.982 --> 13:05.018
Coca-Cola was going through
a series of P.R. scandals,

13:05.018 --> 13:06.486
including the fact
that their cola

13:06.486 --> 13:09.022
was made with cocaine.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.024
Pay no attention
to all that snow.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.525
We're nice people.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.961
To appear more lovable,

13:13.961 --> 13:17.064
Coca-Cola advertised using
a rosy-cheeked, red-suited,

13:17.064 --> 13:18.798
family-friendly
St. Nick,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.200
but they didn't
invent him.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.202
They just used his image
to make a buck.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.372
Man, it's gross how commercial
Christmas has become.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.140
It's sad they pervert
Santa's image

13:27.140 --> 13:28.708
just for their
ad campaign.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.410
Oh, Santa's been used
for weird campaigns

13:30.410 --> 13:31.711
throughout history.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.214
In olden days, he was often
portrayed as a boozer.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.582
(urinating,
zipper zipping)

13:35.582 --> 13:37.417
(to the tune of "Jingle Bells")
♪ Drink, drank, drunk

13:37.417 --> 13:39.186
♪ Drink, drank, drunk

13:39.186 --> 13:42.189
♪ I like getting drunk

13:42.189 --> 13:44.057
But the temperance movement
made him sober

13:44.057 --> 13:45.725
to promote Prohibition.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.727
(groans)
No.

13:47.727 --> 13:48.828
One version of Santa

13:48.828 --> 13:51.331
was used in 20th century
socialist campaigns.

13:51.331 --> 13:55.235
The top 1% of the children
get 99% of the gifts

13:55.235 --> 13:58.538
while the working-class elves
get virtually nothing.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.408
The naughty and nice list
is rigged.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.444
We need a political revolution
at the North Pole.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.613
While in 1874 Mississippi,

14:06.613 --> 14:10.283
there was actually
a Santa-themed KKK rally.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.552
I'm dreaming
of a white Christmas.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.553
Nope, get out of my home.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.587
Nope, you're scum.
Get out of here.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.924
Nope, never.
(groans)

14:16.924 --> 14:19.026
Okay, Santa's been used
for some weird causes,

14:19.026 --> 14:20.193
but so what?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.261
He's a wonderful idea.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.795
Sure, maybe now he is,

14:22.795 --> 14:24.932
but early Santas
were way weirder.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.099
Before 1880,

14:26.099 --> 14:27.935
Santa didn't even live
at the North Pole.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.103
That idea was invented
by Thomas Nast,

14:30.103 --> 14:32.472
who drew Santa
recording kids' behavior

14:32.472 --> 14:35.442
from a giant telescope.

14:35.442 --> 14:39.279
Ho ho!
Someone's being very nice.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.280
That is disturbing.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.982
And the European
precursors to Santa

14:41.982 --> 14:43.583
were even more
messed up.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.452
Germanic nations
replaced St. Nick

14:45.452 --> 14:48.788
with baby Jesus
and a demon named Krampus,

14:48.788 --> 14:51.624
who dragged bad kids
to hell.
(sniffing)

14:51.624 --> 14:56.596
This naughty boy
has been torrenting software.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.998
Aah! I promise to stop.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.167
It's just really hard to find
a good word processor.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.468
(growls)

15:01.468 --> 15:03.670
The Dutch believe
St. Nicholas himself

15:03.670 --> 15:04.972
brought the presents.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.106
(chuckling)

15:06.106 --> 15:07.807
That doesn't seem so bad.
No, it's not.

15:07.807 --> 15:08.841
But instead of an elf,

15:08.841 --> 15:11.278
he was accompanied
by a literal slave

15:11.278 --> 15:12.812
named Black Peter,

15:12.812 --> 15:16.916
often portrayed by a white
person in blackface.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.418
Oh, no. No.
We're not showing that.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.153
Yeah, the KKK St. Nick
was probably enough, huh?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.154
Yeah.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.156
Ugh! Why do we even
celebrate this dude?

15:23.156 --> 15:24.992
Was St. Nick even real?
Oh, yeah.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.193
St. Nicholas of Myra

15:26.193 --> 15:29.196
was the patron saint
of gift-giving and children.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.597
I am probably
gonna regret this,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.865
but why was he the patron
saint of those things?

15:32.865 --> 15:34.834
And please don't say
it's racist stuff again.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.037
Oh, no. Instead,
it's creepy stuff.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.472
Jolly old St. Nick
loved giving gifts,

15:39.472 --> 15:41.641
especially to
young girls.

15:41.641 --> 15:42.709
Excuse me?

15:42.709 --> 15:43.843
He would sneak
into their houses

15:43.843 --> 15:45.112
in the middle
of the night

15:45.112 --> 15:46.546
and leave gold
in their stocking

15:46.546 --> 15:49.016
so they wouldn't
become prostitutes.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.684
No need for streetwalking,
my dear.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.020
I wasn't planning
on it.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.654
And the reason he's
the patron saint of children

15:54.654 --> 15:56.489
is even stranger.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.824
Watch.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.197
A long, long time ago

16:04.197 --> 16:06.699
in a country far, far away...

16:06.699 --> 16:08.535
Is that me?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.803
St. Nick found
a pickle barrel,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.872
but it wasn't just
any pickle barrel.

16:12.872 --> 16:16.376
It was full of dead,
dismembered children.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.378
What?
This is the story?

16:18.378 --> 16:19.479
How do I not
remember this?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.714
Shh. This is
the important part.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.651
St. Nick, through the power
of a holy miracle,

16:24.651 --> 16:28.421
brought all those chunks
of dead children back to life.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.523
Arise!

16:30.523 --> 16:32.925
I am no longer
dead or dismembered,

16:32.925 --> 16:34.361
but I'm still pickled.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.363
Thanks, St. Nick.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.099
So, even though Santa
may not be real,

16:39.099 --> 16:41.434
remember that the real
story of St. Nick

16:41.434 --> 16:44.003
is just as cool
and more magical.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
Thank you.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.875
Santa Claus
isn't real?

16:48.875 --> 16:51.911
Of course not.
It's just a story.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.080
No!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.615
No!
(crying)

16:55.615 --> 16:57.784
Why did everyone
lie to me?

16:57.784 --> 17:03.090
Well, sometimes the things
we've been told are wrong.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.893
It can be fun to find out
the truth behind stories.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.228
If you ask me,

17:08.228 --> 17:10.863
it's always better
to know.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.533
It's always better
to know?

17:15.235 --> 17:16.569
Yeah.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.538
Yeah, you're right.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.141
Actually, what other
myths are there?

17:21.141 --> 17:23.310
I have so much
research to do.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.412
It's always better
to know!

17:28.648 --> 17:30.083
I taught you that?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.284
Yeah.

17:31.284 --> 17:34.954
It's always better to know,
and now you know.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.224
I'm not sure
what to say.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.892
Well, I am.
Thank you.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.262
You made me who I am.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.464
And I know I'm not
the easiest brother to have,

17:44.464 --> 17:48.135
but I've been trying to help
in the only way I know how--

17:48.135 --> 17:50.170
by explaining that all
of these traditions--

17:50.170 --> 17:52.805
(phone vibrates)
Gah! Mom and Dad
are almost here!

17:52.805 --> 17:55.242
No! No! No!

17:55.242 --> 17:57.310
Oh, what are we
gonna do?

17:57.310 --> 17:58.978
Uh, I think I know
how to fix this,

17:58.978 --> 18:01.080
and I'll tell you about it
right after this.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.652
Get out of here, Santas!

18:05.652 --> 18:07.154
My parents are coming.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.988
Rhea, it's okay.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.423
But the cookies
and the garland.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.159
Those things
don't matter.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.793
Of course they do.
It's tradition.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.961
Listen to me.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.663
All traditions
started somewhere,

18:16.663 --> 18:18.698
and all traditions
have changed.

18:18.698 --> 18:19.799
But Mom and Dad--

18:19.799 --> 18:21.668
Started doing things
one way,

18:21.668 --> 18:23.436
and you can do them
another.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.838
You've been putting
so much pressure on yourself

18:25.838 --> 18:28.508
to wrap the right gifts
and make the right food

18:28.508 --> 18:30.810
and remember the true
meaning of Christmas,

18:30.810 --> 18:33.313
but honestly, the true
meaning of Christmas

18:33.313 --> 18:35.815
is whatever
you want it to be.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.718
Because it's all
made up.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.520
And if it's all made up,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.121
I can make
my own traditions.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.356
Exactly.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.524
I think it's time
we stopped trying

18:44.524 --> 18:47.026
to repeat the Christmas
Mom and Dad used to have

18:47.026 --> 18:49.362
and make one
of our own.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.363
Yeah.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.531
Let's do this.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.200
Let's have
a Conover Christmas.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.734
Decorating montage!

18:54.734 --> 18:56.135
What? No. We don't
have time for that.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.204
Oh, why not?

18:57.204 --> 18:58.871
(knocking at door)
Oh, right.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.807
Let's do it our way.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.709
("Deck the Halls" playing)

19:12.018 --> 19:14.187
Ah, this is amazing!

19:14.187 --> 19:15.522
I was worried
it wasn't gonna work

19:15.522 --> 19:17.190
'cause I thought the powers
were just for learning.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.891
Well, there are a few
specific exceptions like--

19:18.891 --> 19:21.027
(knocking at door)
Oh, we should get that.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.830
Hi.
Hi.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.232
Merry Christmas.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.833

Oh, Rhea, I love
the decorations.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.884
They're so you.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.287
They were actually
Adam's idea.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.755
We did them together.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.756
I got to be honest, Adam.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.891
I never knew you had
so many friends.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.260
Me neither.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.895
Plus, this is the third
party I've attended.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.531
The third?
Very impressive.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.699
Oh, look.
There's Krampus.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.268
Let's go dance
with him.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.537
I know what
you're gonna say,

20:04.537 --> 20:05.938
but just open it.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.908
I got you nothing
this year!

20:08.908 --> 20:10.610
Oh, it's exactly
what I wanted.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.279
Thank you.
Yeah, for sure.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.114
Well, I got you
something too.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.816
Adam, I specifically
didn't get you anything

20:16.816 --> 20:19.752
because you said...

20:19.752 --> 20:20.953
Oh.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.955
Never mind.
It's also an empty box.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.458
No, it's
a moving box, see?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.894
I'm looking at some rentals
this weekend.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.796
I'm ready to be
a big boy.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.466
How about you stay
through New Year's?

20:33.466 --> 20:34.567
Then I'll help you look.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.068
Oh, that would be great.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.904
Ooh, then we can sing
"Auld Lang Syne."

20:37.904 --> 20:39.306
And the story
of "Auld Lang Syne"

20:39.306 --> 20:40.673
is real weird.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.941
A lot of people
think it was written

20:41.941 --> 20:43.576
by the poet
Robert Burns...

20:43.576 --> 20:46.813
(narrator)
That Christmas, Rhea learned
that her big brother

20:46.813 --> 20:49.782
wasn't such a big bother
after all,

20:49.782 --> 20:52.151
and that emotionally stunted man
taught us

20:52.151 --> 20:54.321
that the true meaning
of Christmas

20:54.321 --> 20:59.326
is, eh, whatever the (bleep)
we want it to be.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.294
I guess smug men named Adam

21:01.294 --> 21:04.096
really can solve
all the world's problems.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.634
Another Christmas myth
broken.
