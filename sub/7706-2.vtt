00:09.810 --> 00:13.345
Oh, moolai mucka hucka cahoona,
eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!

00:15.649 --> 00:17.649
What're you doing with my drill?

00:17.651 --> 00:20.319
- Drilling holes.
- What for?

00:20.321 --> 00:23.222
So I can get the straws
in these coconuts.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.025
Want a hit?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.459
I suppose this means
there's another

00:27.461 --> 00:29.395
"Gilligan's Island"
rerun tonight.

00:29.397 --> 00:33.065
Yeah, ship sets sail
for that uncharted desert isle

00:33.067 --> 00:34.867
momentarily.

00:34.869 --> 00:38.704
I think you're overdoing
this whole Gilligan thing.

00:38.706 --> 00:42.641
Why? 'Cause I'm making
a couple of Skipper coladas?

00:42.643 --> 00:46.245
What about the bamboo furniture
you ordered for your room?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.147
Hey, I sent it back.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.182
Wasn't even real bamboo.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.918
It was that nauga-boo.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.554
(Brian)
'ALF, it's time for Gilligan.'

00:55.556 --> 00:57.423
Be right with you,
little buddy.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.658
Gotta run, Willie.
Gilligan's on.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.027
Yeah, you better hurry,
if you miss this episode

01:02.029 --> 01:06.198
you'll have to wait three weeks
until it's on again.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.033
You know, it's people like you

01:08.035 --> 01:11.437
who drive quality programming
off the air.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.190
Bravo! Author! Author!

02:38.192 --> 02:40.792
Powerful episode.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.996
- Gilligan's so funny.
- You're telling me?

02:43.998 --> 02:46.632
Chaplin, Keaton, Gilligan..

02:46.634 --> 02:50.002
The great ones
make it look so easy.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.970
Brian, it's time
to get ready for bed.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.872
- Now?
- Come on, Kate.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.441
The kid just watched
"Gilligan's Island."

02:56.443 --> 02:59.378
He needs time
for the nuances to soak in.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.347
They can soak in
in the bath tub.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.449
Aye, aye, mom.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.885
Hey, Kate, did I ever tell you

03:06.887 --> 03:09.821
how much you remind me
of Ginger?

03:09.823 --> 03:10.889
[sighs]

03:10.891 --> 03:14.193
Wow, that's the same look
of disdain

03:14.195 --> 03:16.628
that Ginger gives Gilligan.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.532
That was a compliment.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.734
Boy, she's no fun.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.104
Hey, Willie, we have to talk.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.174
Yeah, speak to me.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.842
"Gilligan's Island."

03:30.844 --> 03:33.845
Why do you think life there
is so much more exciting

03:33.847 --> 03:35.247
than life in..

03:35.249 --> 03:38.817
...oh...let's say this house.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.520
Oh, ALF, you have fun here.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.690
Sure.
When "Gilligan's Island" is on.

03:44.692 --> 03:48.060
That's four hours
every day right there.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.429
I'm trying to make a point here
and you're doing jokes.

03:50.431 --> 03:54.399
Oh, well, by all means then.
Pontificate.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.468
What kind of pie is that?

03:57.438 --> 04:01.240
- Apple.
- Cliche in a crust.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.042
Why did you have
six pieces of it at supper?

04:04.044 --> 04:07.546
The question is
why didn't I have eight?

04:07.548 --> 04:10.048
Because it is boring, man.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.552
Just like everything else
around here.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.188
Not like on "Gilligan's Island"

04:16.190 --> 04:18.557
where every day is topped off

04:18.559 --> 04:20.392
by one of Mary Ann's

04:20.394 --> 04:23.395
coconut cream pies.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.565
ALF, I'm not
going to waste my time

04:26.567 --> 04:29.067
trying to analyze
why you find real life

04:29.069 --> 04:32.771
more boring than some
ludicrous situation comedy.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.241
[gasps]
How erudite.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.644
Reminiscent of the professor.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.682
If you're bored with your pie,
can I have it?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.687
Guess not.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.729
So anyway see, this big fat

04:57.731 --> 05:00.098
native girl
from the next island

05:00.100 --> 05:02.968
eats Ginger's lipstick.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.304
Then before Gilligan
could marry her--

05:05.306 --> 05:07.439
W-wait, wait. Don't tell me.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.908
She goes back
to her own island.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.245
And she leaves
the castaways stranded.

05:13.247 --> 05:16.014
Did I give the ending
away somewhere?

05:16.817 --> 05:20.285
That's how every episode ends.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.221
They never leave the island.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.025
Well, I must've
overlooked the pattern.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.330
But don't overlook the idea

05:31.332 --> 05:34.266
that you can leave this room.

05:34.268 --> 05:38.103
She's right, ALF.
The fun's over for tonight.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.940
The fun never stops
on "Gilligan's Island."

05:41.942 --> 05:44.109
Unlike some other places,
where the fun stopped

05:44.111 --> 05:46.878
during the Eisenhower
administration.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.983
Just go to sleep.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.151
I can't.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.320
I tried counting castaways

05:55.322 --> 05:57.489
jumping over palm trees

05:57.491 --> 06:00.058
but the Skipper's
not the best of leapers.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.295
If you'll let us get some sleep

06:03.297 --> 06:04.730
I promise you

06:04.732 --> 06:06.498
we'll get back
to this Gilligan business

06:06.500 --> 06:08.367
first thing tomorrow and maybe

06:08.369 --> 06:11.937
maybe we'll even build you
a little lagoon, all your own.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.474
You'd do that for me?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.709
Yes, and then maroon you

06:17.711 --> 06:20.245
on the opposite shore.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.315
Fine with me.<i> Aloha.</i>

06:23.317 --> 06:26.551
Hey, if you need some excitement
you know where to look.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.253
Where's that?

06:28.255 --> 06:30.155
Wherever you hear this song..

06:30.157 --> 06:32.657
¶ Just sit right back
and you'll hear a tale ¶

06:32.659 --> 06:34.693
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

06:34.695 --> 06:36.928
¶ That started
from a tropic port ¶

06:36.930 --> 06:39.097
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

06:39.099 --> 06:41.266
¶ The mate was a mighty
sailing man ¶

06:41.268 --> 06:43.769
¶ The Skipper
brave and sure.. ¶¶

06:48.742 --> 06:51.576
Willie, there's something wrong
with the bathtub.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.913
Oh, it's probably clogged
with ALF's hair again.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.848
He just refuses
to vacuum himself

06:56.850 --> 06:58.683
before he takes a bath.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.352
No, it's-it's the faucet.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.854
- There's no water coming out.
- There's..

07:05.893 --> 07:07.692
Well, there's
no water here either.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.895
(ALF)
'Hey, could you turn that off?'

07:09.897 --> 07:12.764
'I'm losing pressure out here.'

07:12.766 --> 07:16.401
Say, what exactly
are you doing out there?

07:16.403 --> 07:18.904
(ALF)
'It's a surprise.'

07:18.906 --> 07:21.973
- He said surprise.
- The dreaded S word.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.877
- 'ALF, what are you--'
- 'Watch it, Willie!'

07:25.879 --> 07:28.380
- 'It's a little slippery.'
- 'Whoa!'

07:28.382 --> 07:30.315
[splash]

07:30.317 --> 07:31.850
(ALF)
'Surprise.'

07:37.257 --> 07:39.291
Well, what do you think?

07:39.293 --> 07:41.993
I don't believe it.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.329
Willie's swimming
in the lagoon I built.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.432
It's just like the one
on "Gilligan's Island."

07:47.434 --> 07:49.067
From now on, life around here

07:49.069 --> 07:51.670
will be much more exciting.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.338
You..

07:55.075 --> 07:57.442
Ah!

07:57.444 --> 08:00.378
See? It's exciting already.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.184
How would you like
to be buried at sea?

08:06.186 --> 08:08.820
You're not happy
about this, are you?

08:09.623 --> 08:12.157
Just tell us why you did it.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.093
- It was Willie's idea.
- What?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.462
Don't try to worm your way
out of this one.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.797
You said we'd build a lagoon.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.500
I said we'd build
a little lagoon

08:21.502 --> 08:24.736
not the great Tanner reef!

08:25.806 --> 08:27.806
Okay. Okay, I misunderstood.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.876
I'm sorry. I made a boo-boo.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.044
A boo-boo?

08:36.683 --> 08:39.651
I want my yard
back the way it was.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.786
I want trees I can trim.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.955
I want grass I can mow.

08:43.957 --> 08:48.326
No water and no hut!

08:48.328 --> 08:51.162
And you are gonna stay
right here

08:51.164 --> 08:52.564
until I get it!

08:52.566 --> 08:54.399
Have I made myself clear?

08:54.401 --> 08:57.068
What? Are you talking to me?

08:58.639 --> 09:01.940
I'm talking directly to you.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.209
Fine, fine!

09:04.211 --> 09:07.479
If that's what you want,
I'll turn the land of adventure

09:07.481 --> 09:10.215
back into dulls-ville.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.417
Immeditaley.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.988
He seems pretty upset, Kate.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.925
You start shoveling,
I'll go have a talk with him.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.863
Right. You talk to him.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.098
He listens to you.

09:28.869 --> 09:32.103
Load 16 tons, what do you get?

09:32.105 --> 09:35.774
Another day older
and deeper in debt.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.876
Whoa! I'm sweating.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.845
First time in 60 years.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.281
ALF, I brought you
some lemonade.

09:43.283 --> 09:47.852
Thanks. This lagoon water
tastes a little brackish.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.221
Well, how much longer is it
gonna take you to fill it in?

09:50.223 --> 09:53.258
- Six weeks.
- Six weeks?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.093
It only took you
one night to dig it up.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.629
Yeah, but I wanted to do that.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.531
This is painful to me.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.700
Have you ever had
to cover your dreams

10:01.702 --> 10:05.203
with a big pile of dirt?

10:05.205 --> 10:09.240
Well, I once had to bury
my pet turtle that died.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.142
Oh, this one?

10:12.379 --> 10:15.413
Does it say greetings
from Miami on it?

10:15.415 --> 10:17.983
No. "Carlsbad Caverns."

10:18.719 --> 10:21.086
Oh, that was Brian's.

10:21.088 --> 10:24.389
<i> Sic transit gloria mundi.</i>

10:24.391 --> 10:27.459
Well, I better
let you get back to work.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.160
Yeah. Yeah.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.763
Work. Work!
Oh, this isn't work.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.765
This is fun.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.966
What're you talking about?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.835
Lynn, I'm talking
about the thrill

10:36.837 --> 10:39.838
of back-breaking manual labor.

10:39.840 --> 10:44.342
Huh, my only regret is that
you can't share this thrill.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.512
Hey. Hey, wait a minute.

10:47.514 --> 10:51.149
Why don't I let you shovel
a couple of metric tons?

10:51.952 --> 10:54.853
Goodnight, ALF.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.489
Gilligan would've
fallen for that.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.227
Well, break time.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.279
I must've slept
through the night.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.184
Hey, where's my shovel?

11:27.688 --> 11:30.055
Where's my house?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.856

Skipper.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.826
Skipper, can I fish too?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.728
It's Gilligan.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.530
The Skipper, too.

11:38.532 --> 11:42.233
Sshh, Gilligan,
you'll scare the fish.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.704
- Oh! Ah!
- Sshh.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.906
You'll scare the fish.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.544
I'm here on Gilligan's isle.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.927
Gilligan!

12:08.929 --> 12:10.228
Skipper, what happened
to your hat?

12:10.230 --> 12:13.098
You're using it for bait.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.601
Oh, I'll get it back for you,
Skipper.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.470
Don't worry, here..

- Melmac.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.716
Oh, them well, Ginger and
Howell's built a country club

13:04.718 --> 13:07.252
on the other side of the island,
but they won't let us in.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.120
They won't let you in, Gilligan.

13:09.122 --> 13:13.591
Not through the front door,
but sometimes I caddy.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.994
Well, what about
the Professor and Mary Ann?

13:15.996 --> 13:18.496
Oh, well,
they're still around, they've..

13:18.498 --> 13:20.298
Hey, wait a minute.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.100
How do you know about all of us?

13:22.102 --> 13:24.636
Yeah, wait a minute. How do you
know about all of us?

13:24.638 --> 13:26.738
I just said that, Gilligan.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.673
I thought it sounded familiar.

13:30.277 --> 13:34.012
[laughing]
Oh, I never get tired of that.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.015
I get tired of it.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.751
Hey, Gilligan,
tell me something.

13:39.753 --> 13:42.020
Mary Ann is really cute.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.656
How come you never
asked her out?

13:44.658 --> 13:45.924
Where would we go?

13:45.926 --> 13:49.761
[laughing]
"Where would we go?"

13:49.763 --> 13:51.963
This little fellow is easily
amused, Gilligan.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.965
- I like him.
- Gilligan!

13:53.967 --> 13:57.302
Skipper. Oh!
Lunch is ready.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.138
Well, I see
we have another visitor.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.041
It's Mary Ann...and lunch.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.810
Two of my favorite things.

14:05.812 --> 14:08.446
Oh, Mary Ann, this is ALF.
He's from Melmac.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.148
How come everybody
can get to this island

14:10.150 --> 14:11.316
and none of us
can ever get off?

14:11.318 --> 14:12.517
- Really?
- Hmm.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.452
I must've overlooked
the pattern.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.757
[ALF laughing]

14:21.161 --> 14:23.795
Let's eat. Come on, ALF.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.997
Lunch with the castaways.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.266
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.670
Mary Ann, did you make
one of your famous

14:32.672 --> 14:34.038
coconut cream pies?

14:34.040 --> 14:37.075
No. They won't let me
make them anymore.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.877
You see, I noticed
our blood sugar levels

14:38.879 --> 14:40.645
were getting dangerously high.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.147
Plus the fact we were
sick to death of them.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.849
You never told me that.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.018
I was remiss.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.320
Anyway, today
we're having mangoes.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.723
- Oh!
- Wow. Mangoes.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.692
- We're sick of mangoes too.
- Oh, I like mangoes.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.762
I'm just sick of making
dental floss for you people.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.065
I get the feeling
you people aren't happy.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.067
We're not. We're bored.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.235
You know we've been doing
the same thing

15:04.237 --> 15:06.504
day in and day out for 23 years?

15:06.506 --> 15:08.506
Yeah, how would you like
to listen to the Skipper's

15:08.508 --> 15:11.709
boring old navy stories
over and over and over?

15:11.711 --> 15:13.945
I thought you liked
my navy stories.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.346
I was a good sailor.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.881
Oh, we're all familiar
with your

15:16.883 --> 15:18.383
nautical record, Skipper.

15:18.385 --> 15:22.053
You're, uh, 0 and 1, I believe.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.721
You see, you have
one little shipwreck

15:23.723 --> 15:25.924
and they never
let you forget it.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.558
Well, you guys
should be grateful.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.928
You're here
on Gilligan's Island.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.362
Are you kidding?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.231
Why, we'd be outta here
in a minute

15:33.233 --> 15:35.266
if smarty pants over here
can figure out a way

15:35.268 --> 15:36.935
for us to get off this rock!

15:36.937 --> 15:38.303
Don't blame me.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.938
Every time I devise a plan

15:39.940 --> 15:43.441
it's ruined by that
hebetudinous sidekick of yours.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.079
- Hebetudinous?
- Addlepated.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.714
Oh.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.581
Why, you can't call

15:50.583 --> 15:52.283
my little buddy addlepated.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.085
Will you stop
calling me little buddy?

15:54.087 --> 15:56.554
I'm in my 40's,
for crying out loud.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.258
Stop it, you people
are supposed to be funny

16:00.260 --> 16:02.560
and friendly and-and wacky.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.330
This is our island. You can't
tell us when to be wacky.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.666
Yeah, who died and made you
King Kamehameha?

16:08.668 --> 16:11.269
Hey, I know something
that'll keep you from fighting.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.271
- A sing-along.
- Oh!

16:13.273 --> 16:14.772
Come on, yeah!

16:14.774 --> 16:17.275
¶ Just sit right back
and you'll hear a tale ¶

16:17.277 --> 16:18.443
Everybody!

16:18.445 --> 16:20.244
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

16:20.246 --> 16:23.081
- Sing!
- We don't feel like singing!

16:23.083 --> 16:24.749
But it's about you guys.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.318
"The mate was a mighty
sailor man.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.620
The skipper brave and sure."

16:29.622 --> 16:31.789
"The skipper brave and sure."

16:31.791 --> 16:34.459
More like big and fat.

16:34.461 --> 16:38.329
How would you like
a big fat fist in your face?

16:38.331 --> 16:41.132
Alright, forget the sing-along.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.800
Uh, let's re-enact the time

16:42.802 --> 16:45.203
when the head-hunter
came to the island.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.005
Now I'll be the head-hunter

16:47.007 --> 16:48.473
and Gilligan could be Gilligan.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.842
I've got a better idea.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.878
Let's re-enact the time
that ALF came to the island

16:53.880 --> 16:55.480
to help us dig.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.616
You be ALF and start digging.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.352
I'm not gonna dig.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.689
I refuse to dig. I won't dig.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.759
I won't. I won't.
I won't. I won't.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.331
- What am I digging here?
- Filling in a lagoon.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.566
Yeah, we're gonna build
a miniature golf course.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.869
And we're not gonna let
the Howell's play on it.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.337
Shall I go get your club,
Skipper?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.672
Oh, Gilligan,
it's not ready yet.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.541
It'll take a couple of months.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.510
Come on,
let the furry little guy work.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.645
It's almost time
for our favorite TV show.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.647
- You have a TV?
- Oh, yeah.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.215
I rigged one up using some
bamboo

17:31.217 --> 17:32.350
a couple of coconut shells

17:32.352 --> 17:33.518
and a 19 inch picture tube

17:33.520 --> 17:35.720
that washed up on the shore.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.089
I even built a VCR.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.858
Yeah, but all our tapes
are beta.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.327
Hey, Gilligan,
digging's really fun.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.431
- You wanna do some?
- Forget it.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.567
Even Gilligan won't fall for it.

17:49.569 --> 17:53.271
- 'What was that for?'
- 'Yeah, I just felt like it.'

17:53.273 --> 17:56.274
Wonder if the Howell's
need a fourth for golf.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.945
Sit down, professor,
I can't see.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.880
I'm adjusting the vertical hold.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.917
Vertical hold?
Looks like a coconut to me.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.852
Give me the hat, Skipper.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.458
(male #1 on TV)
'And now it's time
for the adventures'

18:13.460 --> 18:15.860
'of the Tanner family.'

18:17.397 --> 18:18.696
Tanner family?

18:18.698 --> 18:20.865
(male #1)
'Starring Willie Tanner as dad'

18:20.867 --> 18:24.569
'Kate Tanner as mom,
Lynn Tanner as their daughter'

18:24.571 --> 18:27.138
'and Brian Tanner as himself.'

18:27.140 --> 18:28.906
'This week's episode..'

18:28.908 --> 18:30.541
'...Brian takes a bath.'

18:30.543 --> 18:32.743
Oh, boy, this is my favorite.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.646
I haven't had
a bath in 23 years.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.548
[together]
We know.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.753
That meat loaf
was delicious, mom.

18:42.755 --> 18:47.425
Well, I hope you have room
for some apple pie.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.327
[together]
Oh!

18:49.329 --> 18:50.661
Apple pie.

18:50.663 --> 18:54.398
I haven't had that in 23 years.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.335
Ah, that meat loaf
sounds so delicious too.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.469
I'd like to have
something to eat that didn't

18:58.471 --> 19:00.938
fall out of a tree.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.740
I think I'll get
a glass of water.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.744
Oh, imagine, water you don't
have to draw from a well.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.914
Oh, look, Willie's wearing
a different shirt this week.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.582
I haven't worn a different
shirt in--

19:11.584 --> 19:13.851
- Ah, we know. We know.
- We know.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.289
Can I have some water, dad?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.658
You can have
lots of water, son.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.426
You're taking a bath.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.961
[all laughing]

19:23.963 --> 19:25.963
How does Willie
come up with that stuff?

19:25.965 --> 19:28.032
The great one's
make it look so easy.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.602
- Why was that funny?
- Why was that funny?

19:31.604 --> 19:33.437
These are the most entertaining
people in the world

19:33.439 --> 19:35.006
and you ask why was it funny?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.308
Besides, they can
do things we only dream of.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.443
Oh, they eat balanced meals.

19:39.445 --> 19:41.512
They change their clothes.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.048
They don't hit
each other with hats.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.018
Well, actually
they are pretty entertaining.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.153
Can I watch a little?

19:49.155 --> 19:51.489
Don't you have
some dirt to shovel?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.824
I can shovel dirt back home.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.226
You are home.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.028
You're a castaway now,
fuzzy buddy.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.696
Forever.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.798
I don't wanna be a castaway.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.134
I thought this place
would be fun.

20:03.136 --> 20:07.071
Now I realize, it's only fun
in half hour chunks.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.309
But you wanted to be
on "Gilligan's Island."

20:11.311 --> 20:14.011
That's where the fun
never stops.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.880
Remember?

20:15.882 --> 20:18.349
Remember?

20:18.351 --> 20:21.352
Remember?

20:21.354 --> 20:24.188
I was wrong. I wanna go home.

20:24.190 --> 20:27.425
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.

20:27.427 --> 20:31.229
I wanna go home.
Wanna go home.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.931
Wanna go home.
Wanna go home.

20:33.933 --> 20:37.068
Wanna go home.
Wanna go home.

20:37.070 --> 20:41.205
- I wanna go home.
- ALF, wake up.

20:41.207 --> 20:43.608
Hey.

20:43.610 --> 20:47.678
Oh, Willie, you came all the way
out here to rescue me.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.214
It wasn't really
all that far, ALF.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.116
I was just in the kitchen.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.053
Oh. Well, listen.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.555
I was wrong.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.725
Adventure isn't on some
uncharted desert isle.

21:00.727 --> 21:04.161
It's right here
in your own backyard.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.398
What's left of it.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.834
That's good to hear, ALF.

21:10.536 --> 21:11.769
I'll see you later.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.904
Well, don't I get
to come with you?

21:13.906 --> 21:17.975
What about all that mindless
treacle I just oozed?

21:17.977 --> 21:21.545
As treacle goes,
that was pretty sweet.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.148
Too bad it didn't
fill up the hole.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.217
Get to work.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.955
I hate this place.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.862
[instrumental music]

21:40.466 --> 21:42.733
[burps]

21:42.735 --> 21:46.103
Delicious meat loaf, Kate.
Best I've ever had.

21:46.105 --> 21:49.473
Best anyone's ever had.
Best in the world.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.009
Simply the best.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.679
Thank you, ALF.
Would you like some pie?

21:54.681 --> 21:57.948
- What kind?
- Coconut cream.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.785
Pass.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.154
Oh, hi, I'm sorry
I'm late for dinner.

22:03.156 --> 22:06.324
[laughing]
"Sorry I'm later for dinner."

22:06.326 --> 22:08.759
Willie, you're a scream.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.995
How does he come up
with that stuff?

22:10.997 --> 22:14.965
- What stuff?
- Ha! Oh, there he goes again.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.936
- What is wrong with you?
- Uh, wrong? Nothing's wrong.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.172
I'm the happiest alien on Earth.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.607
What could possibly
be wrong here?

22:23.609 --> 22:27.244
In the fun-filled,
action packed Tanner household.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.316
How's the backyard coming?

22:32.318 --> 22:34.118
Uh, well, uh..

22:34.120 --> 22:36.654
I'd-I'd like to discuss
that with you at length

22:36.656 --> 22:39.890
and, uh,
later would be a good time.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.963
He's been watching "Bonanza."

22:49.001 --> 22:52.737
I'll, uh,
return the stage coach tomorrow.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.909
