<i>Methil, Sir.
You remember it, then?</i>

20:16.320 --> 20:19.000
<i>Rosie Duff murder?
Would've been all over the news.</i>

20:19.000 --> 20:22.600
<i>I was three, Sir.
Three? Jesus.</i>

20:22.600 --> 20:25.360
<i>Well, at least you'll be up with

20:25.360 --> 20:26.800
<i>Yes, Sir. Good.</i>

20:26.800 --> 20:28.840
<i>Ideally, we would have
shut the whole thing down,</i>

20:28.840 --> 20:31.440

<i>Murray, mints. I get it.</i>

21:14.360 --> 21:17.240
<i>Yeah. The lads gave it to me.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.360
<i>Wow. The Machine.</i>

21:19.360 --> 21:21.640
<i>Well, I got the department record

21:23.720 --> 21:26.120
<i>Oh, will I get one?
You've already got one.</i>

21:26.120 --> 21:27.560
<i>What is it?</i>

21:27.560 --> 21:32.640
<i>Er... I don't think it was you, actually.</i>

21:32.640 --> 21:36.200
<i>No, go on.
It was someone else.</i>

21:37.520 --> 21:40.840
<i>Right... Well, I'd quite like one.</i>

21:40.840 --> 21:44.160
<i>It's not been the greatest time

<i>Have you listened to the podcast?</i>

21:51.240 --> 21:54.800
<i>Yeah. It's quite...
It's quite feminist, eh?</i>

21:54.800 --> 21:56.680
<i>And you don't like that?</i>

21:56.680 --> 21:59.880
<i>No, no, no, absolutely.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.240
<i>Mmm.</i>

22:01.240 --> 22:04.920
<i>Well, I suppose
we should start at the beginning.</i>

22:07.760 --> 22:09.760
<i>Who was at the crime scene?</i>

22:11.360 --> 22:14.080
<i>What was at the crime scene?</i>

22:17.040 --> 22:18.760
<i>And why?</i>

22:18.760 --> 22:20.560
<i>'Call an ambulance, she's dying!'</i>

22:26.120 --> 22:29.080
<i>You three, come over here

22:34.720 --> 22:37.000
<i>Still warm...</i>

22:42.920 --> 22:45.640
<i>I'm a medical student. Can I help?</i>

22:54.600 --> 22:56.640
<i>You say you found her?</i>

22:56.640 --> 23:00.440
<i>On our way home.
Why did you leave?</i>

23:00.440 --> 23:02.680
<i>To find a phone.</i>

23:02.680 --> 23:05.480
<i>But you're a medic.
Why didn't you stay with her?</i>

23:05.480 --> 23:07.680
<i>Why didn't one of the others go?</i>

23:14.160 --> 23:16.880
<i>SIRENS</i>

23:26.080 --> 23:30.120
<i>I've tried to resuscitate,
but I think she's gone.</i>

23:30.120 --> 23:32.280
<i>You got an ID?</i>

23:32.280 --> 23:35.240
<i>Rosie Duff... Sir.</i>

23:37.920 --> 23:40.440
<i>Two of them were at the scene...</i>

23:40.440 --> 23:44.200
<i>one of them ran out
right in front of my car.</i>

23:50.720 --> 23:53.240
<i>Thanks, Jimmy.</i>

23:53.240 --> 23:55.640
<i>They said they found her like this.</i>

23:55.640 --> 23:58.200
<i>The one that left
said he was running for help.</i>

24:01.280 --> 24:03.360
<i>Detain them, Jimmy.</i>

24:08.120 --> 24:11.160
<i>I've never seen anything like...</i>

24:11.160 --> 24:14.880
<i>Keep it together, Jan, eh?
For her.</i>

24:15.920 --> 24:17.720
<i>She was strangled.</i>

24:17.720 --> 24:18.880
<i>Ligatures?</i>

24:18.880 --> 24:21.680
<i>By hand.
Is that how she died?</i>

24:21.680 --> 24:25.920
<i>The autopsy concluded that she was
throttled until she was unconscious,</i>

24:25.920 --> 24:29.640
<i>but it was the stomach wound
that killed her.</i>

24:29.640 --> 24:31.040
<i>She bled to death?</i>

24:31.040 --> 24:33.440
<i>Would have taken 20 minutes,
maybe more.</i>

24:33.440 --> 24:35.520
<i>She was just... lying there...</i>

24:35.520 --> 24:39.280
<i>Jesus. Why do that? Cut across
the stomach? Such a slow death.</i>

24:39.280 --> 24:41.720
<i>And why leave her in the cathedral?</i>

24:41.720 --> 24:44.120
<i>I suppose a graveyard
makes some sense.</i>

24:46.560 --> 24:49.720
<i>If you want to get rid of a body,
you bury it,</i>

24:49.720 --> 24:51.200
<i>dump it in the sea, burn it,</i>

24:51.200 --> 24:53.520
<i>you don't leave it in the middle
of a tourist attraction,</i>

24:53.520 --> 24:57.440
<i>right in the middle of summer.
Unless you want someone to find it.</i>

24:57.440 --> 25:00.440
<i>You think that has some
significance? A religious aspect?</i>

25:00.440 --> 25:01.920
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

25:03.000 --> 25:04.640
<i>What was the weapon?</i>

25:04.640 --> 25:07.040
<i>They think it was a kitchen knife.
They didn't find it?</i>

25:07.040 --> 25:09.040
<i>No. Never.</i>

25:09.040 --> 25:12.200
<i>There was another thing -
when they analysed Rosie's clothing,</i>

25:12.200 --> 25:15.560
<i>they found fibres
from the interior carpet of a car.</i>

25:15.560 --> 25:18.240
<i>They moved the body.</i>

25:18.240 --> 25:21.240
<i>There's a second crime scene.
But we don't know where.</i>

25:23.040 --> 25:26.760
<i>OK. So, she's choked unconscious,</i>

25:26.760 --> 25:29.480
<i>moved by car,
laid out in the graveyard</i>

25:29.480 --> 25:31.080
<i>and cut across the stomach...</i>

25:31.080 --> 25:34.320
<i>but there's no sign of a murder
weapon when the police arrive.</i>

25:34.320 --> 25:35.640
<i>Or a vehicle.</i>

25:38.560 --> 25:40.640
<i>Can I have your names, please?</i>

25:43.040 --> 25:44.760
<i>Alex Gilbey.</i>

25:44.760 --> 25:47.360
<i>He's Tom Mackie.
And you?</i>

25:47.360 --> 25:50.560
<i>Sigmund Malkiewicz.
I just wanna go home.</i>

25:50.560 --> 25:53.160
<i>They need to speak to us, Weird,
we're witnesses.</i>

26:08.360 --> 26:12.000

<i>What are you doing? Stop it!</i>

26:34.520 --> 26:37.640
<i>Listen. We didn't see her tonight.</i>

26:37.640 --> 26:40.080
<i>We don't know her. OK?</i>

26:40.080 --> 26:42.640
<i>Didn't see her. Don't know her.</i>

26:44.280 --> 26:46.720
<i>Could you hear me, Weird?</i>

26:46.720 --> 26:48.560
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

<i>Sigmund Malki... Malkiewicz.
Is that right?</i>

29:11.520 --> 29:14.120
<i>Polish, is it?
It's Ziggy.</i>

29:14.120 --> 29:16.640
<i>Ziggy. Right.</i>

29:16.640 --> 29:19.440
<i>Well, I'm Detective Inspector Maclennan,</i>

29:19.440 --> 29:21.320
<i>this is Detective Sergeant Lawson,</i>

29:21.320 --> 29:26.240
<i>and we're going to have a wee chat
about what happened tonight. Hmm?</i>

29:26.240 --> 29:29.640
<i>So, shall we start at the beginning?</i>

29:29.640 --> 29:35.960
<i>We were just walking home
from a party and... we found her.</i>

29:35.960 --> 29:38.280
<i>That's not the beginning, though,
is it?</i>

29:38.280 --> 29:40.560
<i>We watched the match.</i>

29:40.560 --> 29:43.520
<i>Where?
The...</i>

29:43.520 --> 29:46.240
<i>The Lammas pub.</i>

29:47.680 --> 29:51.680
<i>Which is where Rosie worked.
Yeah... I guess so.</i>

29:51.680 --> 29:53.640
<i>And did you see her there?</i>

29:55.480 --> 29:58.720
<i>It was really busy.
Is that a yes or a no?</i>

30:00.360 --> 30:02.800
<i>Just from afar.</i>

30:02.800 --> 30:04.360
<i>Did your friends?</i>

30:06.960 --> 30:09.040
<i>They might have.
Have you ever spoken to her?</i>

30:12.440 --> 30:15.040
<i>I've ordered drinks from her.
So, you knew her?</i>

30:19.640 --> 30:21.120
<i>No...</i>

30:23.840 --> 30:25.560
<i>What time did you leave the Lammas?</i>

30:28.000 --> 30:31.440
<i>Er, 10:30... 11:00-ish.</i>

30:31.440 --> 30:33.080
<i>'And where did you go?'</i>

30:34.200 --> 30:37.200
<i>'To a party.'
'Whose party?'</i>

30:37.200 --> 30:41.040
<i>Some, erm... Some fourth years.</i>

30:41.040 --> 30:43.080
<i>And where was this party?</i>

30:43.080 --> 30:45.520
<i>I...</i>

30:46.960 --> 30:50.040
<i>I don't know.
What time did you get to the party?</i>

30:51.280 --> 30:53.040
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

30:53.040 --> 30:56.120
<i>How long did you stay at the party?
Until we walked home.</i>

30:56.120 --> 30:58.320
<i>Which was at what time?</i>

30:58.320 --> 31:00.760
<i>BUZZING</i>

31:03.600 --> 31:05.920
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

31:05.920 --> 31:08.400
<i>Are you on something, Tom?
No.</i>

31:08.400 --> 31:11.280
<i>We'll be testing you,
so you might want to be honest.</i>

31:16.000 --> 31:18.400
<i>Was this party at Scooniehill Lane?</i>

31:22.400 --> 31:24.160
<i>At this address?</i>

31:29.520 --> 31:31.480
<i>He seems to think it happened
at the party.</i>

31:31.480 --> 31:35.880
<i>It is a big house. It's an
abandoned manor, old, dilapidated...</i>

31:35.880 --> 31:38.600
<i>So plenty of places
to sneak away to...</i>

31:38.600 --> 31:42.480
<i>To have sex, do drugs.
Or, you know, kill someone.</i>

31:42.480 --> 31:46.720
<i>I think that, at the pub,
you invited her to the party.</i>

31:46.720 --> 31:48.360
<i>You wrote the address down here
for her.</i>

31:48.360 --> 31:51.240
<i>She turned up,
and something went very, very wrong.</i>

31:51.240 --> 31:53.680
<i>No! She never came.
So you did invite her?</i>

31:53.680 --> 31:54.800
<i>But she didn't turn up.</i>

31:54.800 --> 31:56.840
<i>That doesn't feel very likely, Ziggy.</i>

31:56.840 --> 31:59.040
<i>I mean, you invited this girl
to a party,</i>

31:59.040 --> 32:01.520
<i>and then we find your friends
with her body,</i>

32:01.520 --> 32:03.600
<i>and you trying to flee the scene,
covered in blood.</i>

32:03.600 --> 32:05.600
<i>No, I was... I was getting help.</i>

32:05.600 --> 32:07.520
<i>And then you hide evidence.</i>

32:07.520 --> 32:10.240
<i>I didn't... It...</i>

32:10.240 --> 32:12.840
<i>It fell out of her pocket
when I was helping her,</i>

32:12.840 --> 32:15.200
<i>I didn't realise
I still had it on me.</i>

32:15.200 --> 32:18.160
<i>So you dropped it and obscured it.
Because I thought it would look bad!</i>

32:18.160 --> 32:19.440
<i>This looks very bad, Ziggy.</i>

32:19.440 --> 32:23.920
<i>And your story is, you invite her
to the party, she doesn't turn up,</i>

32:23.920 --> 32:28.520
<i>and you just happen to stumble
across her on the way home.</i>

32:28.520 --> 32:31.760
<i>Accept the cathedral isn't
on your way home, Ziggy, is it?</i>

32:31.760 --> 32:34.520
<i>It adds a good ten minutes
to your journey.</i>

32:34.520 --> 32:38.640
<i>Sometimes we just walk that way!
I don't know...</i>

32:38.640 --> 32:40.200
<i>You do know, Ziggy.</i>

32:40.200 --> 32:44.240
<i>You took her there. Either dead
or alive, you took her there.</i>

32:44.240 --> 32:45.880
<i>No!
Something happened at that party.</i>

32:45.880 --> 32:47.440
<i>Someone else did this.</i>

32:47.440 --> 32:49.000
<i>Were you sleeping with her?
No!</i>

32:49.000 --> 32:50.640
<i>Did you want to?
No.</i>

32:50.640 --> 32:52.720
<i>Maybe she resisted?
And you didn't like that. No!</i>

32:52.720 --> 32:54.520
<i>Maybe it was one of your friends. No.</i>

32:54.520 --> 32:56.960
<i>Maybe they did this,
and you helped cover it up. No!</i>

32:56.960 --> 32:59.920
<i>Why did you kill her, Ziggy?
Why did you strangle her?</i>

32:59.920 --> 33:01.520
<i>I didn't.
One of you did. No!</i>

33:01.520 --> 33:04.320
<i>Or did you rape her?
Didn't want her to tell anyone?</i>

33:04.320 --> 33:06.880
<i>No!
Maybe you argued, huh?</i>

33:06.880 --> 33:09.520
<i>Your hands went up to her neck...
No, I swear!</i>

33:09.520 --> 33:11.600
<i>What did she do to make you so mad,
Ziggy?</i>

33:11.600 --> 33:13.720
<i>Nothing!
She must have wound you up somehow.</i>

33:13.720 --> 33:15.120
<i>No!</i>

33:18.840 --> 33:22.480
<i>I didn't know her, I didn't see her.</i>

33:24.480 --> 33:26.480
<i>I didn't kill her.</i>

33:28.360 --> 33:32.280
<i>He's missing two things - murder
weapon and a second crime scene.</i>

33:32.280 --> 33:35.320
<i>Is there any witness accounts
that place Rosie at the party?</i>

33:35.320 --> 33:38.200
<i>They interviewed everyone
and nobody saw her.</i>

33:38.200 --> 33:40.360
<i>But they must have searched it
top to bottom.</i>

33:40.360 --> 33:42.360
<i>Yeah, they did,
and they didn't find anything.</i>

33:42.360 --> 33:46.720
<i>Not a single hair, a drop of blood,
or any sign of a murder weapon.</i>

33:46.720 --> 33:49.400
<i>Can we go?
It's since been demolished.</i>

33:49.400 --> 33:52.000
<i>Brilliant. Right...</i>

33:53.160 --> 33:55.520
<i>So, the last place she was seen
was...?</i>

33:55.520 --> 33:59.720
<i>CCTV on the high street at midnight.</i>

34:05.960 --> 34:08.880
<i>See? She ducks.
Doesn't want to be seen.</i>

34:08.880 --> 34:12.640
<i>Iona, her friend, said that
she left the pub to meet someone.</i>

34:12.640 --> 34:14.080
<i>One of these students?</i>

34:14.080 --> 34:16.720
<i>Rosie didn't tell her.
She didn't tell anyone.</i>

34:16.720 --> 34:18.440
<i>Why?</i>

34:18.440 --> 34:21.560
<i>Probably her brothers.
Colin and Brian Duff.</i>

34:21.560 --> 34:24.600
<i>Both extremely protective.
And they were there that night?</i>

34:24.600 --> 34:29.280
<i>Mm. Both tough bastards - criminal
records, drunk driving, assault.</i>

34:30.680 --> 34:32.400
<i>Did she have sex?</i>

34:32.400 --> 34:36.160
<i>There's signs in the postmortem.
But no semen.</i>

34:36.160 --> 34:39.920
<i>So, condom, or didn't finish.
Or she could have been interrupted.</i>

34:41.120 --> 34:44.200
<i>Signs of assault? Rape?
Nothing definitive.</i>

34:44.200 --> 34:46.680
<i>It could have just been rough sex.</i>

34:49.520 --> 34:51.240
<i>But, look, this is interesting.</i>

34:51.240 --> 34:53.000
<i>She was cut right across
the abdomen.</i>

34:53.000 --> 34:55.760
<i>No, look below. She has a caesarean
scar. Across her lower stomach.</i>

34:55.760 --> 34:58.040
<i>It's barely mentioned
in the reports.</i>

34:58.040 --> 34:59.440
<i>Rosie had a baby?</i>

34:59.440 --> 35:03.080
<i>But there's no mention of when
it happened, what happened to it,</i>

35:03.080 --> 35:04.520
<i>or who the father was.</i>

35:04.520 --> 35:07.000
<i>Surely an ex would be
the first place you'd look.</i>

35:07.000 --> 35:09.720
<i>Why didn't they investigate it?
I don't know.</i>

35:09.720 --> 35:12.520
<i>But maybe the brothers
can shine a light.</i>

35:12.520 --> 35:16.280
<i>So, get across
the forensics tonight.</i>

35:17.640 --> 35:19.600
<i>Tonight?</i>

35:19.600 --> 35:22.640
<i>Yeah. Well, we'll go
and see the Duffs tomorrow.</i>

35:23.880 --> 35:25.880
<i>Right. OK.</i>

35:25.880 --> 35:27.680
<i>You got somewhere to be?</i>

35:27.680 --> 35:30.160
<i>Just a HIIT class.</i>

35:31.360 --> 35:34.320
<i>Right. Well, I could, er... I could
put one box on one side of the room</i>

35:34.320 --> 35:36.920
<i>and on the other. And you could
run between them, if you like?</i>

35:36.920 --> 35:39.440
<i>And try and beat your time?
I can play some bleeps, if you like?</i>

35:39.440 --> 35:42.080
<i>OK, OK. Yeah, cos you said you
were really good at the bleep test.</i>

35:42.080 --> 35:44.160
<i>Yeah, I'll do my homework.</i>

35:44.160 --> 35:47.400
<i>Was one of the first things
that you said to me, actually.</i>

36:12.080 --> 36:14.600
<i>Hey.
Hey.</i>

36:14.600 --> 36:17.160
<i>How's it going?</i>

36:17.160 --> 36:19.200
<i>All right.</i>

36:20.680 --> 36:23.040
<i>You not going to text me back, then?</i>

36:24.840 --> 36:29.640
<i>I'm sorry, KP. I'm really sorry.</i>

36:29.640 --> 36:33.000
<i>I keep writing things,
then deleting them.</i>

36:33.000 --> 36:35.240
<i>I've been trying to find
the right words.</i>

36:35.240 --> 36:39.000
<i>Well, heh... Anything would've
been better than nothing.</i>

36:40.000 --> 36:41.520
<i>I know.</i>

36:45.000 --> 36:49.200
<i>We've known each other too long
to be falling out over a job.</i>

36:51.880 --> 36:55.080
<i>I-I-I get it now.
It should be you on this job.</i>

36:55.080 --> 36:57.920
<i>It's right that it's you.
What do you mean?</i>

36:57.920 --> 37:02.400
<i>I-I spoke to Lees about it
and he explained everything.</i>

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
<i>Explained what?</i>

37:04.400 --> 37:08.320
<i>Just what, you know, with the...
the podcast.</i>

37:08.320 --> 37:11.360
<i>All the accusations she's making out
against the police</i>

37:11.360 --> 37:13.800
<i>about gender violence and, you know,</i>

37:13.800 --> 37:17.240
<i>it's appropriate that they got...
Sorry. Wait....</i>

37:19.440 --> 37:22.840
<i>Are you saying they put me on this
because I'm a woman?</i>

37:24.360 --> 37:26.120
<i>Not just that.</i>

37:26.120 --> 37:28.280
<i>And that you've
all been talking about it,</i>

37:28.280 --> 37:31.520
<i>saying that a female has to be
on this because it'll look better?</i>

37:31.520 --> 37:33.880
<i>It's not a bad thing, Karen.</i>

37:35.280 --> 37:37.960
<i>There's a bunch of mediocre
white men in the building</i>

37:37.960 --> 37:39.880
<i>that get promoted all the time,</i>

37:39.880 --> 37:42.440
<i>who cares why we move up,
as long as we're moving up?</i>

37:42.440 --> 37:45.000
<i>I care, Phil. Because I don't want
to walk around this office</i>

37:45.000 --> 37:47.200
<i>with men thinking that I'm a fraud
with a pair of tits.</i>

37:47.200 --> 37:49.720
<i>No-one thinks that, Karen!</i>

37:49.720 --> 37:52.840
<i>Jesus! Everyone knows
you're a good detective.</i>

37:52.840 --> 37:56.000
<i>And a walking, talking PR win
for the service.</i>

37:57.240 --> 38:00.200
<i>I'm not the enemy here, Karen. No...</i>

38:00.200 --> 38:02.720
<i>but you still agree with them.</i>

38:15.520 --> 38:18.560
<i>What the files won't tell you,
but Facebook will,</i>

38:18.560 --> 38:22.360
<i>is that PC Janice Hogg
married Colin Duff in 2001.</i>

38:22.360 --> 38:25.120
<i>PC Hogg, as in,
from this investigation?</i>

38:25.120 --> 38:28.600
<i>The one that found Rosie.
And Rosie's brother?</i>

38:28.600 --> 38:31.720
<i>Small towns are small towns.</i>

38:31.720 --> 38:34.200
<i>And murder cases are very sexy.</i>

38:35.720 --> 38:39.440
<i>They moved into the old Duff
family home after Rosie's dad died.</i>

38:48.880 --> 38:51.480
<i>Hello. Janice.</i>

38:52.600 --> 38:54.240
<i>Oh, no...</i>

38:54.240 --> 38:56.640
<i>What have my boys done now?</i>

38:56.640 --> 39:00.480
<i>It's, er...
It isn't about your boys, Archie.</i>

39:02.240 --> 39:04.240
<i>May we come in?</i>

39:05.640 --> 39:08.880
<i>Aye. Aye, of course. Come in.</i>

39:16.400 --> 39:19.200
<i>Tea or coffee?
No, thank you.</i>

39:29.920 --> 39:33.960
<i>They're taking it seriously, then.
Giving it to some kids.</i>

39:36.160 --> 39:39.680
<i>We're taking it very seriously,
Mr Duff.</i>

39:40.840 --> 39:43.640
<i>I'm DS Karen Pirie,
this is DC Murray.</i>

39:46.920 --> 39:48.680
<i>I'm sorry, Archie.</i>

39:48.680 --> 39:51.200
<i>Thinking about Eileen.</i>

39:51.200 --> 39:53.280
<i>I've let her down.</i>

39:54.960 --> 39:57.240
<i>I lost our baby.</i>

39:58.720 --> 40:00.840
<i>I let this happen to our poor baby.</i>

40:00.840 --> 40:02.800
<i>It's not your fault, Archie.</i>

40:04.280 --> 40:07.800
<i>It's not. She'd know that.</i>

40:09.040 --> 40:11.680
<i>We've detained three people
for questioning.</i>

40:11.680 --> 40:13.000
<i>Who?!</i>

40:13.000 --> 40:15.280
<i>I can't tell you any more than that
at this stage.</i>

40:15.280 --> 40:19.000
<i>You have to. Who?!</i>

40:20.840 --> 40:23.480
<i>I promise, I will keep you updated,
as and when...</i>

40:23.480 --> 40:25.440
<i>Update us now!</i>

40:25.440 --> 40:27.400
<i>If you don't,
we'll find out somehow.</i>

40:27.400 --> 40:29.120
<i>Colin!</i>

40:32.800 --> 40:35.720
<i>Just let Barney do his job.</i>

40:39.440 --> 40:42.000
<i>Colin, we're going to want
to talk to you and Brian</i>

40:42.000 --> 40:43.760
<i>about where you were last night.</i>

40:45.320 --> 40:46.880
<i>What do you mean?</i>

40:46.880 --> 40:50.000
<i>We'd just like your
recollections from the night.</i>

40:51.240 --> 40:53.800
<i>You're going to make us
go through all this again.</i>

40:53.800 --> 40:56.440
<i>I'm sorry. I wish I didn't have to.</i>

41:02.480 --> 41:05.240
<i>Started in the pub. Both of us.</i>

41:05.240 --> 41:07.760
<i>Rosie was behind the bar.</i>

41:07.760 --> 41:13.240
<i>She left at some point and...
and we never noticed.</i>

41:15.760 --> 41:18.760
<i>Brian went off with some girl...</i>

41:20.440 --> 41:23.040
<i>...said he'd come back and get us
after he was done.</i>

41:25.680 --> 41:28.760
<i>When the pub emptied out, that's
when I noticed she wasn't there.</i>

41:30.880 --> 41:34.200
<i>I asked Iona where she'd gone,
she said she didn't know.</i>

41:35.760 --> 41:37.960
<i>Maybe she'd popped out.</i>

41:39.440 --> 41:41.800
<i>What time was this?</i>

41:41.800 --> 41:43.680
<i>Half two.</i>

41:46.160 --> 41:48.960
<i>Iona gave us the keys and said
I could wait in the pub</i>

41:48.960 --> 41:51.160
<i>until Brian or Rosie turned up.</i>

41:54.640 --> 41:56.560
<i>Only they never did.</i>

41:57.800 --> 42:00.720
<i>I fell asleep
in this girl's bed.</i>

42:00.720 --> 42:03.040
<i>I wish I hadnae.</i>

42:03.040 --> 42:05.320
<i>Every day, I wish I hadnae.</i>

42:08.800 --> 42:11.120
<i>Wish I'd never gone wi' her.</i>

42:12.200 --> 42:13.840
<i>How long were you in her house?</i>

42:13.840 --> 42:17.000
<i>Till eight in the morning.</i>

42:18.200 --> 42:20.040
<i>Came back to my dad crying.</i>

42:21.160 --> 42:23.080
<i>Never seen him cry before.</i>

42:23.080 --> 42:25.280
<i>SOBBING</i>

42:29.840 --> 42:35.000
<i>Iona said that Rosie went to
meet someone. But didn't know who.</i>

42:37.240 --> 42:39.400
<i>We know who it was.</i>

42:39.400 --> 42:42.080
<i>You do?
Of course we do.</i>

42:42.080 --> 42:45.800
<i>I saw him talking to her that night.
Little dark-haired one. Pathetic.</i>

42:45.800 --> 42:47.200
<i>Ziggy Malkiewicz.</i>

42:47.200 --> 42:49.200
<i>He was inviting her to the party.</i>

42:50.960 --> 42:54.880
<i>But... why am I explaining this
to you?!</i>

42:54.880 --> 42:57.240
<i>You know all this,
it's in the files.</i>

42:57.240 --> 42:59.320
<i>It's been there for 25 years.</i>

42:59.320 --> 43:01.920
<i>We are going to talk to
Dr Malkiewicz as soon as we can.</i>

43:07.720 --> 43:11.040
<i>Er, Mr Duff, we noticed
from the forensic reports</i>

43:11.040 --> 43:13.760
<i>that Rosie had a caesarean scar
on her stomach.</i>

43:13.760 --> 43:16.840
<i>Did Rosie have a child?
I don't see how this is relevant.</i>

43:16.840 --> 43:19.200
<i>There just wasn't much information
on the reports.</i>

43:19.200 --> 43:21.800
<i>All right, that's enough,
time to go.</i>

43:21.800 --> 43:23.920
<i>Colin...
They don't know what they're doing.</i>

43:23.920 --> 43:27.560
<i>I'm sorry, Mr Duff...
Go on, get out. Get out of my house!</i>

43:30.120 --> 43:32.280
<i>We're sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.</i>

43:38.400 --> 43:42.440
<i>Call the pathologist, Jan. Tell them
to expedite the post-mortem.</i>

43:42.440 --> 43:44.920
<i>We've gotta let those boys go
in a few hours.</i>

43:44.920 --> 43:46.880
<i>We need
every bit of help we can get.</i>

43:53.320 --> 43:54.960
<i>DS Pirie?</i>

43:54.960 --> 43:56.640
<i>Sorry, er...</i>

43:57.600 --> 44:01.600
<i>The, er... The baby didn't survive.
A day or two, maybe.</i>

44:03.040 --> 44:05.120
<i>Oh. I'm sorry.</i>

44:06.560 --> 44:09.480
<i>The father was a local boy,
John Stobie,</i>

44:09.480 --> 44:12.000
<i>just some kid from her class
at school.</i>

44:13.320 --> 44:15.520
<i>Did you ever take a look into him?</i>

44:16.800 --> 44:21.040
<i>Yeah. He was at university
somewhere, I think.</i>

44:21.040 --> 44:22.720
<i>He had nothing to do with it.</i>

44:22.720 --> 44:23.920
<i>It's a dead end.</i>

44:26.000 --> 44:28.960
<i>Thanks, Janice. I appreciate it.</i>

44:53.360 --> 44:56.840
<i>Well, I didn't quite soil myself,
but I was close.</i>

44:56.840 --> 44:59.120
<i>Call Register House, will you?</i>

44:59.120 --> 45:01.840
<i>See if you can get a
birth certificate for Rosie's baby,</i>

45:01.840 --> 45:04.440
<i>and a death certificate, too.</i>

45:04.440 --> 45:06.240
<i>We need to know what happened.</i>

45:07.520 --> 45:10.440
<i>And see if you can track down
a John Stobie.</i>

45:14.360 --> 45:15.680
<i>I mean now.</i>

45:16.760 --> 45:19.600
<i>Yeah, sorry. Just waiting
for my heart rate to come down.</i>

45:27.080 --> 45:28.440
<i>Dr Malkiewicz.</i>

45:29.600 --> 45:31.120
<i>DS Karen Pirie.</i>

45:33.360 --> 45:35.040
<i>Would you like a drink, Karen?</i>

45:36.080 --> 45:38.880
<i>Surgery always makes me thirsty.</i>

45:39.960 --> 45:41.280
<i>Sure.</i>

45:43.000 --> 45:47.680
<i>I'm sorry, just,
you're in there six, eight hours,</i>

45:47.680 --> 45:49.160
<i>and the focus gets you through,</i>

45:49.160 --> 45:51.760
<i>but then you come out and you
realise you haven't eaten anything</i>

45:51.760 --> 45:53.000
<i>since last night</i>

45:53.000 --> 45:55.800
<i>and you can't remember the last time
you had a glass of water.</i>

45:56.840 --> 46:01.520
<i>Well, I'd be a bit worried
if my surgeon was that dehydrated.</i>

46:01.520 --> 46:05.040
<i>Well, if I passed out, they'd just
stick an IV straight in to me.</i>

46:06.520 --> 46:08.120
<i>It's a joke.</i>

46:08.120 --> 46:10.720
<i>I know what I'm doing in there.</i>

46:10.720 --> 46:12.440
<i>Ha-ha.</i>

46:13.640 --> 46:16.200
<i>You haven't returned
any of my calls.</i>

46:16.200 --> 46:18.960
<i>Well, I don't really have to talk
to you. This is just a courtesy.</i>

46:18.960 --> 46:22.120
<i>Well, then, I will offer you
a courtesy right back.</i>

46:22.120 --> 46:25.320
<i>I've been listening
to your initial interview from 1996</i>

46:25.320 --> 46:27.200
<i>and wanted to give you
the opportunity</i>

46:27.200 --> 46:29.400
<i>to add anything
you may have missed out.</i>

46:29.400 --> 46:31.480
<i>Missed out?</i>

46:31.480 --> 46:35.360
<i>Well, it's been a long time.
Perspective can change things.</i>

46:35.360 --> 46:36.880
<i>No, nothing's changed.</i>

46:36.880 --> 46:38.800
<i>You stand by your testimony?</i>

46:38.800 --> 46:42.160
<i>You saw Rosie in the pub, and
then you found her at the cathedral?</i>

46:42.160 --> 46:43.800
<i>That's right.</i>

46:45.040 --> 46:46.720
<i>I've been speaking
to the Duff brothers.</i>

46:46.720 --> 46:49.440
<i>Well, you can immediately
discount anything they have to say.</i>

46:49.440 --> 46:50.560
<i>That's very convenient.</i>

46:50.560 --> 46:52.920
<i>They seem pretty sure
you were involved with their sister.</i>

46:52.920 --> 46:56.840
<i>They're a pair of vicious thugs.
Rosie was terrified of them.</i>

46:56.840 --> 46:59.640
<i>They controlled her life.
And how do you know that?</i>

46:59.640 --> 47:01.080
<i>Well, everyone knew that.</i>

47:02.120 --> 47:03.760
<i>Right.</i>

47:05.440 --> 47:07.320
<i>But you did know her, didn't you?</i>

47:07.320 --> 47:08.840
<i>You were seeing her, weren't you?</i>

47:08.840 --> 47:10.080
<i>I'm gay, Detective.</i>

47:11.320 --> 47:12.840
<i>Married now.</i>

47:12.840 --> 47:14.560
<i>Happily. To a man.</i>

47:16.680 --> 47:19.080
<i>Have you ever had relationships
with women?</i>

47:20.320 --> 47:22.840
<i>Well, there was a time
when I was working myself out.</i>

47:22.840 --> 47:24.160
<i>Rosie involved in that?</i>

47:24.160 --> 47:26.000
<i>No.</i>

47:27.880 --> 47:30.680
<i>You know, I don't think
I want to talk to you any more.</i>

47:32.560 --> 47:33.880
<i>Not without a lawyer.</i>

47:44.120 --> 47:45.960
<i>RADIO CHATTER</i>

47:48.320 --> 47:49.960
<i>SIREN</i>

48:38.240 --> 48:41.680
<i>SIRENS</i>

48:48.720 --> 48:51.680
<i>Right. Nothing incriminating
in the students' house</i>

48:51.680 --> 48:52.880
<i>or the party house.</i>

48:52.880 --> 48:55.000
<i>And all three boys
are maintaining their innocence.</i>

48:55.000 --> 48:57.040
<i>You don't think
we have enough to charge?</i>

48:57.040 --> 48:58.880
<i>No, not yet.</i>

48:58.880 --> 49:02.080
<i>Release them,
but we'll keep eyes on them.</i>

49:02.080 --> 49:03.600
<i>Sir, how can we release them?</i>

49:03.600 --> 49:05.680
<i>They are still under investigation, Janice.</i>

49:07.600 --> 49:09.160
<i>We've got to let them go.</i>

49:11.720 --> 49:13.480
<i>DOOR SLAMS</i>

49:15.360 --> 49:17.040
<i>DOOR OPENS</i>

49:23.080 --> 49:24.200
<i>DOOR OPENS</i>

49:57.840 --> 50:01.280
<i>Register House just sent over a
birth certificate for Rosie's baby.</i>

50:01.280 --> 50:03.440
<i>Does it have a father on there?
Printing now.</i>

50:07.760 --> 50:12.200
<i>Orla Rose Duff,
born August 21st '93...</i>

50:13.680 --> 50:14.880
<i>No dad.</i>

50:20.680 --> 50:22.520
<i>Zoom in to that part.</i>

50:31.640 --> 50:33.360
<i>Adopted?</i>

50:33.360 --> 50:37.120
<i>How can she be adopted
if she only lived a day or two?</i>

50:38.640 --> 50:40.160
<i>Maybe she didn't die...</i>

50:42.120 --> 50:44.080
<i>...but that means Rosie lied
to everyone.</i>

50:45.400 --> 50:46.720
<i>Why?</i>

50:56.240 --> 50:57.760
<i>DS Karen Pirie.</i>

50:57.760 --> 50:59.360
<i>Hi. John Stobie.</i>

51:00.560 --> 51:01.720
<i>Thank you.</i>

51:01.720 --> 51:07.680
<i>I mean, I knew her.
We were friends when we were wee.</i>

51:07.680 --> 51:09.440
<i>You never had a relationship
with her?</i>

51:09.440 --> 51:11.040
<i>Not even close.</i>

51:11.040 --> 51:14.920
<i>We used to walk home from school
together sometimes,</i>

51:14.920 --> 51:17.080
<i>that was the extent of it.</i>

51:17.080 --> 51:18.880
<i>Did you ever sleep with her?</i>

51:18.880 --> 51:20.200
<i>Never.</i>

51:23.360 --> 51:25.000
<i>Is this...</i>

51:25.000 --> 51:26.680
<i>from her brothers?</i>

51:34.080 --> 51:40.400
<i>I don't really know
where it came from, or why.</i>

51:42.120 --> 51:47.000
<i>I just remember one day, they were
waiting outside school for me.</i>

51:47.000 --> 51:49.560
<i>They followed me halfway home,</i>

51:49.560 --> 51:52.560
<i>then,
when there was no-one around...</i>

51:54.240 --> 51:55.800
<i>...they jumped me.</i>

51:56.960 --> 51:58.440
<i>Battered me.</i>

51:58.440 --> 52:00.200
<i>Black and blue.</i>

52:02.080 --> 52:03.640
<i>Did they say why?</i>

52:03.640 --> 52:07.120
<i>They said I'd slept with Rosie.</i>

52:07.120 --> 52:09.680
<i>Got her pregnant.</i>

52:09.680 --> 52:13.040
<i>Wouldn't believe me
when I said it wasn't true.</i>

52:13.040 --> 52:14.440
<i>Did you talk to Rosie about it?</i>

52:15.760 --> 52:18.360
<i>I stayed far away from her
after that.</i>

52:20.200 --> 52:21.680
<i>They broke my nose.</i>

52:23.480 --> 52:25.200
<i>Collarbone.</i>

52:26.400 --> 52:28.000
<i>Couple of ribs.</i>

52:30.600 --> 52:32.400
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

52:32.400 --> 52:34.160
<i>It's a long time ago now.</i>

52:36.880 --> 52:38.840
<i>I have always wondered, though,</i>

52:38.840 --> 52:40.920
<i>why me?</i>

52:42.720 --> 52:45.360
<i>Why did she tell them it was me?</i>

52:47.320 --> 52:51.000
<i>It sounds as though she was
protecting someone else.</i>

52:59.400 --> 53:01.560
<i>Please!</i>

53:01.560 --> 53:03.240
<i>HELP!</i>

53:08.640 --> 53:10.440
<i>PLEASE!</i>

53:10.440 --> 53:13.000
<i>PANTING</i>

53:15.240 --> 53:16.560
<i>Hm.</i>

53:17.800 --> 53:19.160
<i>You OK?</i>

53:19.160 --> 53:21.680
<i>Yeah...</i>

53:21.680 --> 53:22.960
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:24.520 --> 53:27.040
<i>What was it?</i>

53:27.040 --> 53:29.720
<i>Did you dream I cheated on you
with Dua Lipa again?</i>

53:31.080 --> 53:32.360
<i>No.</i>

53:35.080 --> 53:37.440
<i>That would be so much worse.</i>

53:38.800 --> 53:40.680
<i>Everything's gonna be OK.</i>

53:43.680 --> 53:45.360
<i>Say it again.</i>

53:46.400 --> 53:49.480
<i>Everything is going to be OK.</i>

54:01.400 --> 54:02.920
<i>Sir?</i>

54:02.920 --> 54:04.720
<i>Sir.</i>

54:06.600 --> 54:08.360
<i>Thanks for taking the time.</i>

54:08.360 --> 54:11.000
<i>Not at all, I've been looking
forward to meeting you, Karen.</i>

54:13.960 --> 54:16.560
<i>DCS Lawson was there
the first time around,</i>

54:16.560 --> 54:19.280
<i>so will be an invaluable source
for you.</i>

54:19.280 --> 54:20.840
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

54:22.200 --> 54:25.320
<i>Rosie's baby...
Getting straight into it, I see.</i>

54:25.320 --> 54:27.840
<i>There's barely any mention of it
in the files.</i>

54:27.840 --> 54:30.520
<i>There's a brief reference to it
in the post-mortem,</i>

54:30.520 --> 54:32.360
<i>but no further details. Why?</i>

54:32.360 --> 54:37.280
<i>Well, DI MacLennan was very good
friends with Rosie's father, Archie.</i>

54:37.280 --> 54:40.040
<i>He wanted it kept out of the reports
as much as possible.</i>

54:41.200 --> 54:44.840
<i>She was 15 when she got pregnant.
He didn't want people finding out,</i>

54:44.840 --> 54:46.320
<i>judging her, for being so young.</i>

54:47.800 --> 54:49.520
<i>Right.</i>

54:49.520 --> 54:51.840
<i>Why wouldn't you look into
who the father was?</i>

54:51.840 --> 54:53.200
<i>The family answered that for us.</i>

54:53.200 --> 54:54.400
<i>John Stobie?</i>

54:54.400 --> 54:56.880
<i>Yeah. A local boy,
as far as I remember.</i>

54:58.640 --> 55:01.880
<i>Rosie told her family the baby died.</i>

55:01.880 --> 55:03.200
<i>It didn't.</i>

55:04.200 --> 55:06.960
<i>There's no death certificate,
we've checked.</i>

55:11.880 --> 55:13.640
<i>It was adopted.</i>

55:13.640 --> 55:15.760
<i>And that local boy?
I've spoken to him.</i>

55:15.760 --> 55:18.560
<i>He can't be the father
because he never slept with her.</i>

55:18.560 --> 55:21.200
<i>How do you know? Have you
looked into him as a suspect?</i>

55:21.200 --> 55:23.200
<i>He's got a solid alibi
for the night she died.</i>

55:23.200 --> 55:24.760
<i>He was away at Leeds, at university.</i>

55:24.760 --> 55:26.400
<i>There's no way he could have
killed her.</i>

55:26.400 --> 55:27.920
<i>And the important thing here is...</i>

55:27.920 --> 55:29.560
<i>Her child is still alive.</i>

55:29.560 --> 55:31.240
<i>And we don't know
who the father was.</i>

55:31.240 --> 55:32.960
<i>No. I don't think that's important -</i>

55:32.960 --> 55:35.640
<i>a relationship from three years
previous? How's it connected?</i>

55:35.640 --> 55:38.560
<i>The lies. Why would she hide it?</i>

55:38.560 --> 55:41.600
<i>She was 15, that's why. Why would
you cover up who the father was?</i>

55:41.600 --> 55:44.000
<i>Maybe he was 17, and knew
the family would press charges.</i>

55:44.000 --> 55:45.760
<i>We should be looking into that!</i>

55:45.760 --> 55:48.720
<i>I'd like to go to Child Services...
Hang on.</i>

55:48.720 --> 55:50.920
<i>I can trace the child...
These things are sensitive.</i>

55:50.920 --> 55:52.040
<i>Ask her to take a DNA test.</i>

55:52.040 --> 55:54.840
<i>The Duff family would disagree.
...I could probably find the father.</i>

55:54.840 --> 55:56.680
<i>PIRIE!</i>

55:58.640 --> 56:02.800
<i>Tracing adopted children should
always, always be a last resort.</i>

56:02.800 --> 56:06.360
<i>We can't just go marching
into people's lives causing chaos!</i>

56:06.360 --> 56:08.520
<i>These things, they have to be
properly considered.</i>

56:08.520 --> 56:10.680
<i>This person could be living
a perfectly happy life,</i>

56:10.680 --> 56:13.400
<i>completely unaware that
their birth mother was murdered,</i>

56:13.400 --> 56:15.840
<i>and that that murder
remains unsolved. But, Sir...</i>

56:15.840 --> 56:16.880
<i>No.</i>

56:19.400 --> 56:22.800
<i>No. We are already
under the microscope.</i>

56:22.800 --> 56:25.280
<i>Anything we do, any slip-up,
it'll be podcasted</i>

56:25.280 --> 56:27.520
<i>and bloody message-forumed
all over the internet...</i>

56:27.520 --> 56:29.800
<i>Oh, sir, that's...
DI Lees is right, Karen.</i>

56:29.800 --> 56:31.880
<i>We have to tread gently.</i>

56:32.920 --> 56:35.000
<i>It's good to know
that we have that option,</i>

56:35.000 --> 56:36.920
<i>should all other avenues
be exhausted.</i>

56:39.360 --> 56:41.240
<i>Have you considered the possibility</i>

56:41.240 --> 56:44.160
<i>that one of the students
could have been the father?</i>

56:44.160 --> 56:45.680
<i>They weren't in St Andrews yet.</i>

56:45.680 --> 56:49.360
<i>No. But two of them lived in
Kirkcaldy. Only half an hour away.</i>

56:49.360 --> 56:51.480
<i>And they were older than her.</i>

56:51.480 --> 56:55.080
<i>As Lees says, that would give her
a good reason to hide it.</i>

56:57.600 --> 56:59.080
<i>I'll look into it, Sir.</i>

57:00.840 --> 57:01.960
<i>Do.</i>

57:03.720 --> 57:05.240
<i>Good work, Sergeant.</i>

57:05.240 --> 57:08.600
<i>We could have done with some
of that thinking first time around.</i>

57:16.320 --> 57:17.840
<i>All right, quick as you can.</i>

57:18.960 --> 57:21.120
<i>I've been hassling forensics
for the report.</i>

57:21.120 --> 57:22.200
<i>Any luck?</i>

57:22.200 --> 57:24.920
<i>Not yet, but they've given us a
heads-up. They found a certain type</i>

57:24.920 --> 57:26.520
<i>of fibre all over Rosie's clothes.</i>

57:26.520 --> 57:27.680
<i>It needs further tests,</i>

57:27.680 --> 57:30.040
<i>but they reckon they're
from carpeting found in a car.</i>

57:30.040 --> 57:31.400
<i>What, over everything?</i>

57:34.000 --> 57:38.200
<i>She was lying on the carpet,
probably in the boot.</i>

57:38.200 --> 57:40.400
<i>She was moved.</i>

57:41.640 --> 57:44.040
<i>Did the students
have any access to a vehicle?</i>

57:44.040 --> 57:45.560
<i>I can find out.</i>

57:48.480 --> 57:49.880
<i>We need to move the car.</i>

57:51.280 --> 57:54.240
<i>How are we going to do that?
They're gonna be watching us!</i>

57:54.240 --> 57:55.480
<i>We don't know that.</i>

57:55.480 --> 57:57.240
<i>That's what they do -
they monitor you.</i>

57:57.240 --> 57:59.160
<i>It's not worth the risk, Zig.
We just got out.</i>

57:59.160 --> 58:01.760
<i>But think about how bad it'll be
if they find it.</i>

58:10.800 --> 58:12.880
<i>Where did you leave it, Weird?</i>

58:14.080 --> 58:15.880
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

58:15.880 --> 58:17.520
<i>How can you not be sure?</i>

58:17.520 --> 58:20.240
<i>I was off my face, Ziggy!
You shouldn't have been driving.</i>

58:20.240 --> 58:21.600
<i>Jeez, arrest me!</i>

58:25.880 --> 58:27.520
<i>Right, the girl -</i>

58:27.520 --> 58:29.440
<i>the one you're driving home -</i>

58:29.440 --> 58:30.880
<i>where does she live?</i>

58:30.880 --> 58:33.440
<i>Well, call her! I can't! They'll be
listening in on the phone.</i>

58:33.440 --> 58:35.000
<i>Don't be stupid!</i>

58:35.000 --> 58:37.160
<i>And I don't have her number.
Where are the keys?</i>

58:37.160 --> 58:38.400
<i>Think I left them in there.</i>

58:38.400 --> 58:40.240
<i>Well, that's one smart thing
that you did.</i>

58:49.280 --> 58:51.000
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

58:52.280 --> 58:54.200
<i>They said that we could go back
to Kirkcaldy.</i>

58:56.200 --> 58:59.840
<i>You can go to Weird's,
and I'll stay here tonight.</i>

58:59.840 --> 59:01.320
<i>And do what?</i>

59:01.320 --> 59:04.520
<i>I'll go out after dark
to find the car. And I'll move it.</i>

59:04.520 --> 59:06.240
<i>I'll take it back.</i>

59:11.720 --> 59:13.240
<i>'Did you hear about that case'</i>

59:13.240 --> 59:15.240
<i>where someone threw a brick
off an overpass</i>

59:15.240 --> 59:17.880
<i>and it smashed through the
windscreen and killed the driver?</i>

59:17.880 --> 59:19.240
<i>No. What?</i>

59:19.240 --> 59:21.040
<i>They found traces of DNA
on the brick</i>

59:21.040 --> 59:23.400
<i>and then they traced him
through an ancestry website.</i>

59:23.400 --> 59:25.360
<i>Oh.
And didn't you...</i>

59:25.360 --> 59:26.960
<i>No. ..go on some dates... No.</i>

59:26.960 --> 59:29.120
<i>...with that guy from that site?
What was his name?</i>

59:29.120 --> 59:31.680
<i>Rob, and I am not going back there.
Hear me out.</i>

59:31.680 --> 59:34.720
<i>Rosie lied about
who the father of her baby was.</i>

59:34.720 --> 59:37.120
<i>That means there's a story there.</i>

59:37.120 --> 59:38.680
<i>Something is up.</i>

59:38.680 --> 59:40.920
<i>But Lees and Lawson won't let me
go to Child Services</i>

59:40.920 --> 59:42.520
<i>to find out where she is.</i>

59:42.520 --> 59:44.880
<i>So you want to go to
WhatsMyHeritage.com?</i>

59:44.880 --> 59:46.120
<i>That's what it's called!</i>

59:47.400 --> 59:50.920
<i>I know it sounds mad,
but loads of people use them now,</i>

59:50.920 --> 59:53.120
<i>and they have these huge DNA banks</i>

59:53.120 --> 59:55.600
<i>that might be bigger
than the police's.</i>

59:55.600 --> 59:56.880
<i>I don't see how this connects.</i>

59:56.880 --> 59:59.880
<i>Say you're adopted,
like Rosie's child was,</i>

59:59.880 --> 1:00:02.360
<i>you'd probably be quite interested
in finding out</i>

1:00:02.360 --> 1:00:04.200
<i>who your long lost family were.</i>

1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:07.880
<i>You'd sign up to a site like that
and send in your DNA.</i>

1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:10.800
<i>So you wanna send Rosie's DNA in?</i>

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:13.000
<i>Yeah. See if there's any matches.</i>

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:16.520
<i>If I can find the kid's, then I can
find the father, Rosie's ex,</i>

1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:19.000
<i>and I can find out
what Rosie was hiding.</i>

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:20.400
<i>The only problem is,</i>

1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:23.160
<i>they don't open up their databases
to just anyone.</i>

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:25.320
<i>No.</i>

1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:28.320
<i>Oh, come on,
I thought you liked Rob? I did!</i>

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.160
<i>If anything, too much.</i>

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:33.680
<i>It was... intense.</i>

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:35.040
<i>Doesn't sound bad.</i>

1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:38.840
<i>He sexted me all the time,
non-stop.</i>

1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:41.320
<i>I honestly ran out of things to say.</i>

1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:42.800
<i>I ran out of...</i>

1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:47.920
<i>...camera angles.
It was exhausting - it had to end.</i>

1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:50.040
<i>Come on, take one for the team!</i>

1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:53.200
<i>It's poking a bear, Karen.
A horny bear.</i>

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:55.240
<i>OK.</i>

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:56.800
<i>Will you just think about it?</i>

1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:00.760
<i>Fine. I mean, I do feel for you
with this podcast lady.</i>

1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:02.080
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:04.760
<i>On Twitter, she's always riling
everyone up. Look at this.</i>

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:09.280
<i>"Fife Police - victim-shaming"
and there's the video.</i>

1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:10.360
<i>What video?</i>

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:15.840
<i>In light of these events,
I would like to ask the women,</i>

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:18.200
<i>particularly the young women
of St Andrews</i>

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:22.320
<i>and the surrounding areas,
to be particularly vigilant.</i>

1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:26.640
<i>I would also advise against
venturing outdoors alone after dark.</i>

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.760
<i>And you should also make sure
that someone knows</i>

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.200
<i>where you are at all times.</i>

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:34.760
<i>If at any point you feel threatened
or see anything out of the ordinary,</i>

1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:37.520
<i>please contact the police
straight away.</i>

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:39.160
<i>Any further questions?</i>

1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:42.320
<i>Your warning implies that
it's up to the women of St Andrews</i>

1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:43.800
<i>to keep themselves safe.</i>

1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:47.800
<i>I just want to take any measures
we can,</i>

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:50.560
<i>combined with excellent policing,
to keep our daughters,</i>

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:55.920
<i>granddaughters, sisters,
out of harm's way.</i>

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:58.280
<i>You detained three people
and have since released them.</i>

1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:00.080
<i>Is that not putting women
in more danger?</i>

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:01.880
<i>As is law in Scotland,</i>

1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:04.560
<i>an arrest cannot be made
without sufficient evidence.</i>

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.920
<i>Enquiries are ongoing.
Can you reveal their names?</i>

1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:09.080
<i>Not until they are charged,
if they are charged.</i>

1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.760
<i>So you'll protect them,

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:13.760

<i>Head in the game, Murray.</i>

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:08.840

1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:10.120
<i>Bel Richmond?</i>

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:13.240
<i>Thought so.
You don't look like golf tourists.</i>

1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:15.040
<i>DS Pirie. This is DC Murray.</i>

1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:19.000
<i>An expensive place to stay
for a couple of weeks.</i>

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.600
<i>Yeah, I'm lucky.
They've been so supportive.</i>

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:24.240
<i>The hotel?
The chain. They sponsor us.</i>

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:27.960
<i>Oh. Great business opp.
A dead girl...</i>

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:31.520
<i>Oh, this is off the record,
by the way.</i>

1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:33.440
<i>No, I won't use any of it
on the podcast.</i>

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:35.160
<i>That's right.</i>

1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:41.920
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:44.080
<i>Just need to be sure. Yeah.</i>

1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:47.960
<i>I'm delighted
you're reopening the case.</i>

1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:52.240
<i>Oh, you are? Oh, you seem sceptical
of the police on the podcast.</i>

1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:54.440
<i>I have to ask questions.</i>

1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:56.880
<i>Sometimes, those questions
aren't very helpful.</i>

1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:00.440
<i>Well, I think the Duff family
want them answered.</i>

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:04.680
<i>I can't stop you reporting,
we both know that.</i>

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.040
<i>And why would you?
I think the pressure helps.</i>

1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:09.200
<i>Very sure of your opinions.</i>

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.880
<i>You can't think the original
investigation was well run?</i>

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:14.920
<i>I don't think you know much
about the original investigation.</i>

1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:20.040
<i>I know they haven't re-examined
the case for a quarter of a century.</i>

1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:25.280
<i>Aren't they supposed to review
these things every few years?</i>

1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:27.040
<i>Why didn't they?</i>

1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:28.760
<i>Until...</i>

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:30.960
<i>I came along.</i>

1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:35.600

<i>I'd like to help you.</i>

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:43.240
<i>I have done a lot of research.</i>

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:46.640
<i>I've spent weeks on my hands

<i>tracked down friends of Rosie's...</i>

1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:53.560
<i>Well, we'll take a look
at all of that.</i>

1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:55.720
<i>Oh, no, I'm not sure that...</i>

1:04:55.720 --> 1:04:58.720
<i>You wouldn't want to
withhold evidence, would you?</i>

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:02.760

1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:14.800

<i>You can't be serious?</i>

1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:50.360
<i>We need to know what she has
so we can be one step ahead.</i>

1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:53.200
<i>What if she's got 18 boxes
of flippin' nothing?</i>

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:56.760
<i>Well, then, you've had a nice day in
a hotel room with a charming lady.</i>

No, I'll kill her.</i>

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:00.640
<i>Oh, she's gonna grill me all day.</i>

1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:43.880
<i>I went to St Andrews.</i>

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:47.880
<i>People would
always talk about it, you know?</i>

1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:50.160
<i>Someone knew someone who knew Rosie,</i>

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:52.800
<i>someone's girlfriend was living
in the three students' house,</i>

1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:55.000
<i>someone heard a rumour
about who really did it...</i>

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:56.360
<i>Who was that, then?</i>

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:01.040
<i>Could save me some time.</i>

1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:04.920
<i>Trust me, I went down those roads -
didn't lead anywhere.</i>

1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:08.520
<i>So...</i>

1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:11.560
<i>Why podcasting, then?
What got you into that?</i>

1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:14.480
<i>Are you asking me questions
so I don't ask anything of you?</i>

1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:18.040
<i>Erm... Absolutely.</i>

1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:19.800
<i>Mm. Sneaky.</i>

1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:22.400
<i>Doesn't mean I'm not interested.</i>

1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:24.560
<i>Er...</i>

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:29.680
<i>It's just a really direct way
of telling a story.</i>

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:33.800
<i>I like that people
who maybe wouldn't read the paper</i>

1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:36.200
<i>or a long piece online
might tune in.</i>

1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:38.840
<i>I guess that's me, then.
I listen to it in the gym.</i>

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:41.920
<i>As long as you're listening,
I don't mind where.</i>

1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:47.440
<i>OK, my turn.</i>

1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:49.720
<i>What sort of physical evidence...?</i>

1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:53.280
<i>No. No. No. No, you're gonna
have to try harder than that.</i>

1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:02.800
<i>Mr Gilbey. Hi, just thought
I'd try you again.</i>

1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:05.360
<i>It's DS Karen Pirie here.</i>

1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:08.880
<i>I'd really appreciate a chat
if possible.</i>

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:10.520
<i>Er, you can...</i>

1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:14.000
<i>you can find me on this number. Thanks.</i>

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:18.080
<i>Celebration?</i>

1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:20.560
<i>Sort of, yeah.</i>

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:23.120
<i>I spoke to Lawson and...</i>

1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:25.920
<i>...he's moving me up to Murder Squad.</i>

1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.200
<i>That's great.</i>

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:43.760
<i>I'm sorry, KP.</i>

1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:49.080
<i>I'm an arsehole.</i>

1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:51.760
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:53.480
<i>But I knew that before.</i>

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:57.560
<i>Yeah, and you used to like it.</i>

1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:00.120
<i>OK, Phil.</i>

1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:03.520
<i>Look, have you got time for a drink,
now?</i>

1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.640
<i>No. Not really.</i>

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:13.000
<i>I'm gonna have to drink this
all by myself, which...</i>

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.880
<i>is a bit sad.</i>

1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:17.560
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:21.040
<i>I'll see you around.</i>

1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:03.200
<i>Hey.</i>

1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:12.200
<i>It's starting again.</i>

1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:14.120
<i>The questions from the police.</i>

1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:18.080
<i>The press attention.</i>

1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:21.800
<i>The... looks,</i>

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:24.880
<i>the whispers -
and it's worse this time,</i>

1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:27.360
<i>because there's the internet.</i>

1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:33.960
<i>I think...</i>

1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:37.880
<i>we need to do this differently
this time.</i>

1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:42.280
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:47.880
<i>I think we need
to tell them the truth.</i>

1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:49.160
<i>You started this, Ziggy.</i>

1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:52.240
<i>Which is why I'm the one
suggesting that we come clean.</i>

1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:53.760
<i>No, not after all this time.</i>

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:56.680
<i>I can't eat, I can't sleep,</i>

1:12:56.680 --> 1:12:57.960
<i>I keep on running and running,</i>

1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:00.200
<i>thinking it's gonna clear my head.
I'm cracking up!</i>

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:03.080
<i>We're all cracking up, Ziggy.
Yes, but my job needs me lucid!</i>

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:04.400
<i>There won't be work in prison.</i>

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.120
<i>We've all got responsibilities.
We've all got something to lose.</i>

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:12.680
<i>I've got a baby on the way.</i>

1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:18.280
<i>But we made promises
to each other...</i>

1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:20.080
<i>and we can't go back on them now.</i>

1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:24.800
<i>It will pass.
Alex, I...</i>

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.280
<i>It will pass.</i>

1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:31.800
<i>It did before.</i>

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:37.360
<i>Hold the course.</i>

1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:40.480
<i>We stick to the story.</i>

1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:43.160
<i>I-I just...</i>

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:45.960
<i>...I don't think I can.</i>

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.800
<i>Well, you better, Ziggy, OK?</i>

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.760
<i>I think it's time to start drinking.</i>

1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:27.480
<i>I'm technically on the clock.</i>

1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:29.080
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:30.800
<i>And driving.</i>

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:32.280
<i>It's Chateauneuf du Pape.</i>

1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:42.320
<i>One can't hurt.</i>

1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:43.640
<i>Thanks.</i>

1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:50.120
<i>I know your plan.</i>

1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:51.480
<i>Get me drunk...</i>

1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:53.120
<i>lock the door.</i>

1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:55.920
<i>Torture me until I tell you
something you don't already know.</i>

1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:00.840
<i>Is it so bad to want to enjoy
a glass of wine with our work?</i>

1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:02.000
<i>It's heavy stuff.</i>

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.280
<i>Where are these from?</i>

1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:07.280
<i>Oh... another student.</i>

1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:09.600
<i>There's a couple of the boys there,
but nothing that I...</i>

1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:11.520
<i>I need to take this.
Wait, what?</i>

1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:13.120
<i>I'm sorry -
thank you for the wine...</i>

1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:14.600
<i>No, no, wait, what?!</i>

1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:39.120
<i>Whose party is this?!
Toad of Toad Hall?</i>

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.120
<i>Some fourth years found it and,
apparently, nobody lives here,</i>

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:45.040
<i>so it's all ours!</i>

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:51.160
<i>DANCE MUSIC PLAYING</i>

1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:55.480
<i>Hey, drink some water, man.</i>

1:15:55.480 --> 1:15:58.720
<i>That Dorothy's all right, eh?
Kind of looks a bit like Rosie.</i>

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:01.160
<i>Maybe chew some gum.
I'm gonna chew on her.</i>

1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:03.200
<i>The lucky girl!</i>

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:08.200

<i>You all right?
Yeah.</i>

1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:51.680
<i>I've gotta say something.</i>

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:57.600
<i>You need to stop messing around.
You're either in it or you're not.</i>

1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:02.160
<i>And if you're not...</i>

1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:04.320

1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:29.560
<i>I tried to call -
you didn't pick up.</i>

1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:31.320
<i>It's kind of urgent, though.</i>

1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:34.480
<i>They lied.
She was at the party with Ziggy.</i>

1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:37.520
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:39.640
<i>Another student.
Bel didn't think they were useful.</i>

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.040
<i>Smells good.
Where you been?</i>

1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:53.560
<i>Oh, you know, surgery ran over. Complications.</i>

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:57.280
<i>Go OK in the end?
Yeah, it was fine.</i>

1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:00.480
<i>Ah! No. No. You're not running now.</i>

1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:02.080
<i>My mind's going...</i>

1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:05.360
<i>No, come on, sit down, talk to me.
I've got to, OK? It's...</i>

1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:08.520
<i>It's the only thing keeping me sane
at the minute.</i>

1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:10.880
<i>Do you really think
it's keeping you sane?</i>

1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:18.960
<i>OK! But we're eating dinner together
afterwards, though.</i>

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:21.000
<i>No phones.</i>

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:25.280
<i>But you must remember something
about where you left it?</i>

1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:27.360
<i>Well, can you at least try, Weird?</i>

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:30.520
<i>It's a freaking car,
not a contact lens.</i>

<i>No, no, the pigs are out the front.</i>

1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:50.400
<i>Yeah, I'll go out the back.
They won't see me.</i>

1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:53.280
<i>All right.</i>

1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:55.240
<i>All right, bye.</i>

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:19.360
<i>You haven't said anything
in about 20 minutes, Col.</i>

1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:26.800
<i>Yeah, there's not much to say.</i>

1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:30.120
<i>I know.</i>

1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:32.800
<i>I know.</i>

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:54.000
<i>I just want to hurt something!</i>

1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:01.480
<i>I know where they live.</i>

1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:07.720
<i>The three they caught.
I saw them, going home.</i>

1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:10.240
<i>Why didn't you tell me earlier?!</i>

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:12.080
<i>Get in the car.</i>

1:20:31.960 --> 1:20:34.560
<i>Col, that was one of them!
No, it wasn't.</i>

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:49.400
<i>See, I told you!</i>

1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:50.800
<i>Are you one of them?</i>

1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:53.440
<i>It is, Colin, I swear, we've seen
them in the pub, talking to her!</i>

1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:54.920
<i>Right, let me out.</i>

1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:58.760
<i>Come here. Come here.</i>

1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:02.200
<i>Get off!</i>

1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:04.920
<i>Get off!</i>

1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:07.840
<i>Get in. Get in.</i>

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:10.400
<i>Go, Donnie! Go! Go!</i>

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:15.560
<i>This is huge. I asked him yesterday,
to his face,</i>

1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:18.680
<i>"Do you want to change your story,"
and he said no,</i>

1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:21.440
<i>he saw her at the pub
and then the cathedral.</i>

1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:24.680
<i>But now we know she was at the party
with him. MacLennan was right.</i>

1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:26.040
<i>Her brothers were right.</i>

1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:30.480
<i>He's been lying all this time,
and finally we've caught him in it.</i>

1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:37.840
<i>You knew my sister.
No!</i>

1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:39.160
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:42.520
<i>You were seen hanging around
the Lammas bar.</i>

1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:44.920
<i>I saw you talking to her,
you and your pals. I can't breathe!</i>

1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:46.400
<i>Did she meet you three?
No!</i>

1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:48.400
<i>See, I don't believe you.
Where are you taking me?</i>

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:50.600
<i>To make you tell the truth.</i>

1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:00.920
<i>No.</i>

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:02.760
<i>Every time you do this,
it gets worse for you.</i>

1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:04.960
<i>No, please, stop, stop!
Stop, please!</i>

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:06.680
<i>Climb it.</i>

1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:09.880
<i>Climb it or I will kill you.</i>

1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:11.880
<i>I don't care any more.</i>

1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:13.520
<i>We lost Rosie.</i>

1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:17.760
<i>Rosie's dead.</i>

1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:20.200
<i>CRIES OUT</i>

<i>Bottle dungeon.
Always wondered what was down there.</i>

1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:36.240
<i>I did warn you.</i>

1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:41.320
<i>No. No. What's down there? No! No!
No. No.</i>

1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:44.720
<i>Tell me what happened
and I'll let you go.</i>

1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:46.720
<i>I've told you everything!</i>

1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:48.680
<i>Why are you still lying to me?</i>

1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:52.120
<i>Hold onto me, Donnie.</i>

1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:53.440
<i>Why do you think I'm lying?!</i>

1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:55.280
<i>I heard you were there,
covered in her blood.</i>

1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:58.360
<i>You killed her!</i>

1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:00.360
<i>No, I swear, I swear to God.</i>

1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:04.080
<i>HE YELLS</i>

1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:45.560
<i>DS Karen Pirie, this is DC Murray -
what's going on?</i>

<i>Hit and run. White male, early 40s.</i>

1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:49.760

<i>DS Karen Pirie, Serious Crime.

<i>Is he injured or...?
No, he's...</i>

1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:18.000
<i>He's dead.</i>

1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:26.360
<i>'Trauma can have a ripple effect.</i>

1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:30.600
<i>'At the centre is the victim -</i>

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:34.760
<i>'the individual who has directly
experienced the traumatic event,</i>

1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:38.760

<i>'The friends and colleagues
of the victim.'</i>

1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:02.600
<i>SOBS</i>

1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:07.240
<i>'Or those who were at close
physical proximity to the event.</i>

<i>'At the next level
are the rescue and recovery teams.</i>

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:20.120
<i>'The fire service, the paramedics,
the police.</i>

1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:26.000
<i>'And the ripples continue
onwards and outwards</i>

<i>'unless something changes</i>

1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:33.240

<i>Alex. Alex!</i>

1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:56.800
<i>What you need to do right now, Alex,
is answer our questions honestly.</i>

1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:05.080
<i>Rosie was in the car with Weird
that night.</i>

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:06.440
<i>Who was she there to see?</i>

1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:09.160
<i>I really don't know.</i>

1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:12.320
<i>I will kill you with my bare hands.</i>

1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:16.120
<i>Colin, your alibi for the time
of Rosie's murder isn't solid.</i>

<i>You don't think that
I'm feeling some consequences?</i>

1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:23.680
<i>I felt like
I needed to do something.</i>

of Ziggy and Weird.</i>

1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:29.560
<i>They've been named on the internet.
So their identities are out there?</i>

1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:33.480
<i>You have sabotaged this case
so profoundly</i>

1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:36.080
<i>that I am in one mind
to take you off it completely.</i>

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.320
<i>SHE YELLS</i>

1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:44.680
<i>We were young. We were drunk.</i>
