WEBVTT

00:16.875 --> 00:20.291
I just got the town rebuilt,
and it's destroyed again!

00:20.375 --> 00:24.375
And the only police work
you did was sing "Pump Up The Jam"?!

00:24.458 --> 00:25.416
You know what?

00:25.500 --> 00:28.416
You're fired!
And so are the rest of your idiot cops.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.291
Oh, shit!

00:31.666 --> 00:35.500
Randall! The baby is coming! Now!

00:35.583 --> 00:39.458
Oh, I was wondering how long it would take
to make this about you, Karen.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.208
-No!
-Ah, no!

00:47.500 --> 00:49.416
Dobby, what the hell
is the matter with you, boy?

00:49.500 --> 00:52.791
We didn't raise you to swallow dogs,
grown men, and perverts.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.791
He learned that from watching you, Robby.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.625
Well, that's different.
When I do it, I get a nickel.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.583
Dobby, get your little ass to the house.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.833
Phew. Well, I'm glad
everything got resolved.

01:05.916 --> 01:07.708
Randall! The baby!

01:07.791 --> 01:10.916
All right, we gotta book you an Uber
to the hospital, don't we?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.375
Ah, surge pricing. Shit.

01:13.458 --> 01:17.375
Well, since someone just fired me,
we better make that an UberPool.

01:17.458 --> 01:21.000
Did one of you fellers
order a UberPool?

01:21.083 --> 01:22.833
This is coming up in therapy.

01:22.916 --> 01:27.708
And as your therapist, I reckon
I recommend you attend your child's birth.

01:27.791 --> 01:29.625
You're the doctor, Dr. Earl.

01:29.708 --> 01:30.541
Yoop!

01:35.458 --> 01:37.583
Ugh… H-How are you feeling, Doc?

01:37.666 --> 01:40.375
A little off.
I pooped after my shower again.

01:40.458 --> 01:41.875
About the baby!

01:41.958 --> 01:43.625
Oh! Don't worry, Randall.

01:43.708 --> 01:47.041
Like I always say,
"Stillborn is still born."

01:49.125 --> 01:50.375
Push, Karen. Push.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.291
Oh!

01:53.375 --> 01:55.333
Oh, look at him.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.166
He's got my face.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.750
Ooh! I just can't get enough
of that new baby smell.

02:54.875 --> 02:58.083
Randall. I shit on the table,
you fucking idiot!

02:59.166 --> 03:00.833
Fuck you! I'm keeping him!

03:03.541 --> 03:06.458
Where's my little baby brother?
I can't wait to meet him.

03:06.541 --> 03:10.416
Allow me to introduce
the newest member of our family,

03:10.500 --> 03:12.083
Kevin Crawford.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.791
Hey. That's my name.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.166
Was your name.

03:15.250 --> 03:18.083
We only called you that
'cause we thought you were gonna be a boy.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.458
He's a doody head.

03:19.541 --> 03:21.333
That's right!

03:21.416 --> 03:24.250
He got you, cocksucker!

03:24.333 --> 03:27.250
Okay. He's already
asserted dominance over me.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.375
Anyway, I-I brought you something…

03:29.458 --> 03:31.041
…Kevin.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.833
Yeah, that phone is bullshit, AFKAK.

03:33.916 --> 03:34.916
AFKAK?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.125
AFKAK. A-F-K-A-K.

03:37.208 --> 03:41.375
"Asshole formerly known as Kevin."
Try to keep up, huh, AFKAK?

03:41.458 --> 03:43.708
Randall bought me an iPhone 11.

03:43.791 --> 03:47.666
I already hooked up
with a smoking piece of ass on Bumble.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.333
Who's gonna get stank on his hang low?

03:50.416 --> 03:53.208
Yes, baby's gonna get stank
on his hang low.

03:53.291 --> 03:55.666
You're a little fuckboy. Yes, you are.

03:55.750 --> 03:58.250
It's time for a snack, little Kevin.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.750
Hey! You never breastfed me.

04:00.833 --> 04:04.416
I tried, but you made too much eye contact
and kept getting erections.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.708
I never did that.

04:05.791 --> 04:07.291
Ugh. You're doing it now.

04:08.208 --> 04:11.833
You're not missing much.
I can't drink this stuff straight.

04:23.375 --> 04:26.625
This is gross as fuck, but it's still
pretty cool that he made it.

04:26.708 --> 04:30.250
Hey, AFKAK. Even you have to admit
he's way better than you are.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.458
So what, I'm the second favorite son now?

04:32.541 --> 04:33.583
No. Third.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.333
I'ma whip your little ass

04:39.416 --> 04:42.083
for going all goddamn Godzilla
on our town.

04:42.166 --> 04:45.416
We just got that Quiznos.
Go break me off a switch.

04:46.458 --> 04:49.000
What the fuck kinda switch is that?
I can't lift that shit!

04:49.083 --> 04:52.291
You know I'm on fake disability.
Now, you go to your room.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.208
What the fuck?!

04:56.291 --> 04:58.083
Your son crushed our house!

04:58.166 --> 05:00.500
Oh, he's my son
when he does something bad,

05:00.583 --> 05:04.541
but when people compliment
his abnormally large penis, he's your son.

05:05.833 --> 05:09.125
Oh, great. Where we gonna find
a new shithole to live in, huh?

05:11.083 --> 05:13.500
Hey, Delbert, are you, uh,
thinking what I'm thinking?

05:13.583 --> 05:15.375
We should go to trade school,
get real jobs,

05:15.458 --> 05:18.000
save up for a down payment
on a nice home in the suburbs,

05:18.083 --> 05:20.666
maybe a Craftsman Bungalow
or a Tudor Revival?

05:20.750 --> 05:24.208
I was gonna say climb up
our son's asshole and live inside him.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.833
Yeah. Your idea is better.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.833
Hey, Karen. Guess you thought
we'd be upset because you fired us,

05:31.916 --> 05:35.666
but we're not, because the PD
now stands for Party Dudes,

05:35.750 --> 05:39.375
and this station
is now called The Brozone Lair.

05:40.625 --> 05:45.708
We're all gonna be playing board games
and-- and eating Sun Chips and, uh…

05:46.291 --> 05:50.541
God, Karen!
Please, give me my job back!

06:03.625 --> 06:04.458
Morning!

06:04.541 --> 06:06.000
What you doing, AFKAK?

06:06.083 --> 06:10.458
I've called every fight club and fat camp
in the state. None of them have seen Gina.

06:10.541 --> 06:13.250
Does it look like I give a goddamn?

06:13.333 --> 06:17.666
Jesus, Dusty! You used to be so nice.
When did you become an asshole?

06:17.750 --> 06:21.875
It's called character development.
You should try it sometime.

06:21.958 --> 06:25.458
I'm just gonna try to forget
that Gina is missing

06:25.541 --> 06:28.541
and that my bullshit baby brother
stole my name.

06:28.625 --> 06:29.916
Morning, Brozone-ites.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.875
First off, a moment of silence
in remembrance of Bullet and Fitz.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.083
What about Hopson?

06:35.166 --> 06:36.875
Oh, I didn't forget Hopson.

06:42.875 --> 06:46.708
I'd also like to call for a moment
of silence for the police force.

06:46.791 --> 06:49.750
It's weird.
The town seems better off without us.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.375
Yeah, well, we did a shitty job.

06:51.458 --> 06:55.416
The PD is over. But at least
we don't have to smell Hobo-Cop anymore.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.333
Hey! I'm a f-- a fan favorite.

07:00.416 --> 07:02.750
Wait, Karen let you remain a cop?

07:02.833 --> 07:05.958
Yep. She said she couldn't fire Hobo-Cop.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.541
I guess she likes the name.

07:07.625 --> 07:10.458
She says it's the most clever joke
this show's ever made.

07:10.541 --> 07:14.166
Well, fuck the police.
We're banning cops from the Brozone!

07:14.250 --> 07:16.208
Well-- well, your loss!

07:16.291 --> 07:20.166
Good luck having a scene
without a z-zinger from me!

07:25.666 --> 07:28.416
Hey, AFKAK.
Go sell all this police stuff on eBay.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.875
Next time somebody tries
that peekaboo bullshit on me,

07:31.958 --> 07:33.500
I'll be fucking ready.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.958
You can't have a gun!

07:35.041 --> 07:37.625
Don't worry.
Daddy taught him how to use it.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.958
Yep. Just like Daddy taught him.
He's a crack shot.

07:42.041 --> 07:45.000
We're gonna win that father-son
deer-hunting competition.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.250
You're taking him?

07:46.333 --> 07:49.083
But that's the one thing
we do together every year.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.750
Of course I'm taking him.
You're against hunting.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.333
And I'm against spending time with you.

07:53.416 --> 07:56.208
Randall says,
when we win this competition,

07:56.291 --> 07:59.791
I'll be his favorite son,
and you'll be dead to him.

07:59.875 --> 08:03.041
Bet those stakes
really chap your vagina, AFKAK.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.125
Uh, if I had a vagina,
it <i>would</i> be chapped,

08:06.208 --> 08:07.583
because I'd lick it all the time.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.500
Na-na, na-na-na!

08:09.583 --> 08:11.083
Well, I guess it's up to AFKAK

08:11.166 --> 08:13.958
to make sure that baby Kevin
doesn't win that competition.

08:14.041 --> 08:17.500
Using the ancient
Beastie Boys art of sabotagey!

08:21.666 --> 08:24.625
That was hilarious!

08:24.708 --> 08:26.458
You fucking assholes.

08:27.958 --> 08:29.291
Hello, sir.

08:29.375 --> 08:34.583
I would like to exchange these 25
defective kitty cats I got here last week.

08:34.666 --> 08:37.625
Turns out they ain't got nine lives.
They only got one.

08:37.708 --> 08:40.166
You killed 25 cats in a week?

08:40.250 --> 08:43.333
Thirty, counting the ones
I ran over on my way here.

08:45.416 --> 08:48.208
It says here, last year,
all your cats starved to death.

08:48.291 --> 08:52.000
Well, there's a perfectly
rational explanation for that, sir.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.625
I hired a drug addict dog to cat-sit

08:54.708 --> 08:57.625
while I was on death row
for murdering Santy Claus.

08:57.708 --> 09:02.000
You are cut off, mister. There is no way
we are ever giving you another cat.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.833
Just 'cause I'm a little clumsy?

09:03.916 --> 09:07.583
Plus, look at all them poor kitties
that wanna come home with me.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.208
That's the same way Garfield went.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.458
Ironically, he did it on a Tuesday.

09:17.541 --> 09:19.958
Get it? 'Cause he hates Mondays?

09:21.666 --> 09:23.125
Garfield humor.

09:23.208 --> 09:28.333
Oh! A fucking gut buster! Great job!

09:29.500 --> 09:31.125
Robby, man, this just ain't right.

09:33.416 --> 09:35.916
You gotta wipe your damn feet
before you go inside.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.916
See, man? I told you
this would be better than our old place.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.666
Well, there is less shit on the walls.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.750
Oh. Shit. Wow.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.708
Dob-maste, my brothers.

09:53.791 --> 09:57.166
Welcome to Dob-topia.

09:57.833 --> 10:01.083
That's right.
Dob-salamu alaikum, my brother.

10:01.166 --> 10:05.791
I've never been happier since I connected
with the natural world of Dob-topia.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.333
It's the perfect place to raise our son.

10:08.416 --> 10:13.416
I finally feel fulfilled,
since I became a sperm rancher.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.041
-Hyah!

10:15.791 --> 10:17.875
This is how we were meant to live,

10:17.958 --> 10:21.666
in a true paradise
untouched by human hands.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.000
It truly feels like home.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.291
At least it will.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.291
Back that shit up right here, Delbert.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.041
What the hell?

10:31.125 --> 10:34.375
Did you bring every white trash thing
you could think of?

10:34.458 --> 10:35.333
Yes, we did.

10:35.416 --> 10:37.500
Ladies and gentlemen, Kid Rock!

10:38.666 --> 10:43.166
Hey, y'all! Who's ready
to hear some shitty music?

10:43.250 --> 10:45.208
My sweet little man.

10:45.291 --> 10:49.583
Mommy's gonna miss you so much
when she's at work. Yes, she is.

10:49.666 --> 10:52.833
<i>Phew. Good thing you aren't having</i>
<i>that terrible postpartum depression</i>

10:52.916 --> 10:53.958
<i>like you did with AFKAK.</i>

10:54.041 --> 10:56.416
-Nope. Happy as a clam. Bye.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.916
I fucking hate you! Fuck my family!

11:03.583 --> 11:05.750
Oh! This will pass, Karen.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.833
When I was a baby,
my mother had postpartum depression.

11:08.916 --> 11:11.041
On the bright side, I learned to swim.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.375
Out of a car
that had been pushed into a lake.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
Well, thanks for trying
to cheer me up, Anton,

11:16.583 --> 11:20.291
but my life sucks,
and my legacy has been ruined.

11:20.375 --> 11:24.333
I spent a year rebuilding Paradise,
and now it's destroyed again.

11:24.416 --> 11:25.875
You know what? Fuck it!

11:27.125 --> 11:27.958
No!

11:28.041 --> 11:30.875
Before you unleash
the bitch-krieg, listen to this.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.916
I found a way
to save the town and your legacy.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.083
Elon Musk is looking
to move Tesla's headquarters.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.750
I think Paradise has a shot,

11:38.833 --> 11:42.250
because Elon Musk is highly committed
to ruining his company.

11:42.333 --> 11:45.250
"Call a heroic cave diver
a pedophile," check.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.416
"Endorse a bipolar rapper
for president," check.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.375
"Spend six billion
on tunnels to nowhere," check.

11:51.458 --> 11:54.083
"Name your son using Wingdings," check.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.583
Pretty good day, Elon, check!

12:00.208 --> 12:03.083
Who's the new guy? Seems like a weirdo.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.750
He seems fine to me.

12:06.916 --> 12:10.083
That judgmental attitude
is why you're divorced, bro-bro.

12:10.166 --> 12:13.291
Attention, fellow… uh, deer!

12:13.375 --> 12:17.333
How many of us have lost loved ones
at the father-son hunting competition?

12:17.416 --> 12:20.958
I'm gonna make sure
that this year, none of us get killed.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.083
The buck stops here.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.958
"The buck stops…"

12:26.041 --> 12:28.250
Yeah. That's hacky, man.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.250
These will protect you.

12:32.541 --> 12:34.166
Wait. What is this?

12:34.250 --> 12:37.541
Oh, that-- that's a gun.
You don't want that. Those are dangerous.

12:37.625 --> 12:41.208
Instead of making sure they don't kill us,
why don't we just kill them?

12:41.916 --> 12:44.583
I-I don't-- I don't think
we wanna do that.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.333
Where'd you get horses?

12:46.416 --> 12:47.916
Attack!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.833
Whoa! Yeah!

12:53.000 --> 12:56.583
Sumbitch tell me
I can't have a kitty? I'll show him!

12:56.666 --> 12:58.916
Ooh! Yum!

12:59.000 --> 13:00.875
Oh, that's juicy.

13:00.958 --> 13:02.083
Definitely not a trap.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.791
What the hell?

13:05.875 --> 13:07.125
You gonna be my new cat.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.750
I ain't no cat!

13:08.833 --> 13:10.625
-Do you shit in a box?
-Yes, sir.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.416
-Do you eat mice?
-Yes, sir.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.083
Do you have a bank account?

13:14.166 --> 13:15.625
-No, sir.
-Then you a cat.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.333
Holy shit. I'm a cat.

13:18.416 --> 13:20.458
Ooh! I will name him George,

13:20.541 --> 13:23.583
and I will hug him
and pet him and squeeze him!

13:24.750 --> 13:27.333
Let me go! You're killing me!

13:30.875 --> 13:33.583
I knew I should have declawed you,
you son of a bitch!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.875
All this noise is stressing out my babies.

13:49.083 --> 13:53.916
That's it! I hereby call a meeting
of the Dob-topian council!

13:55.833 --> 13:57.333
Okay. We've gotta deal with--

13:57.416 --> 13:58.666
Oh, hey. Hold on.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.041
We didn't do the Dob-topian handshake.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.500
Fuck the handshake!

14:02.583 --> 14:05.250
I once fucked a hand and a shake,

14:05.333 --> 14:07.750
and then I got fired from Dairy Queen.

14:07.833 --> 14:11.125
Well, since Mr. Grump
is in such a little hurry,

14:11.208 --> 14:13.708
I guess we'll just skip straight
to the ceremonial council song.

14:20.750 --> 14:21.833
Stop it!

14:21.916 --> 14:25.458
Listen! These rednecks
are destroying Dob-topia.

14:25.541 --> 14:27.625
All in favor of kicking them the hell out…

14:27.708 --> 14:29.833
Are you serious?
No ceremonial voting song?

14:37.416 --> 14:39.166
-You gonna finish your supper?

14:39.250 --> 14:40.166
Shut the fuck up.

14:40.250 --> 14:43.750
Well, damn. That's the last time
I'm making you Lobster Sperm-idore.

14:45.416 --> 14:48.666
Baby Kevin, I can't wait
to bring home that trophy this year.

14:48.750 --> 14:52.625
You sit there and look pretty, Dad.
I'll do all the heavy lifting.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.833
Oh. Did you hear that?
He called me pretty.

14:54.916 --> 14:58.833
Nuh-di-di-di-di-di-di!
Not so fast, Edward Finger-Hands.

14:58.916 --> 15:01.208
Jerry and I are winning that trophy.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.041
Hey, you guys can't even hold guns.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.208
Who needs a gun?

15:10.791 --> 15:12.875
Huh. Strange we haven't seen a deer yet,

15:12.958 --> 15:15.750
but I'm sure
we'll stumble across those poor,

15:15.833 --> 15:18.166
dumb, defenseless animals soon enough.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.666
What the fuck?

15:28.250 --> 15:31.791
Oh my God, the deer are killing off
all the ancillary characters!

15:31.875 --> 15:33.458
Run, Judge Judge! Run!

15:37.333 --> 15:39.916
Where the fuck
did they get a plane?

15:41.416 --> 15:44.625
Hey, there.
I'd like to speak to Elon Musk, please.

15:44.708 --> 15:46.250
What's that? I've got the wrong number?

15:46.333 --> 15:47.541
You know what? Fuck it!

15:50.166 --> 15:53.666
I haven't seen someone so eager
to push a button on a desk

15:53.750 --> 15:55.708
since I interned for Matt Lauer.

15:55.791 --> 15:57.625
Zinga-ding-ding!

16:44.666 --> 16:47.666
Bro, you literally
just killed me with that dance.

17:20.875 --> 17:23.458
Oh, I beg to differ, baby!

17:29.625 --> 17:33.500
Ugh. I think you're looking
for the Hopson song, sir.

17:40.041 --> 17:41.625
Run, Delbert!

17:44.875 --> 17:46.750
The council has spoken.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.666
You two must leave Dob-topia at once.
The way you came in.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.458
That ain't gonna be possible.

17:57.750 --> 18:01.375
Call me Woody Allen
'cause I just blew up my kid's asshole.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.375
Ooh! Zinga-ding-ding!

18:03.458 --> 18:04.416
Allegedly.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.166
You idiots have destroyed
the delicate balance of the Dob-osphere.

18:08.250 --> 18:11.041
Dob-damn it! Dob-topia is Dob-doomed!

18:11.125 --> 18:13.083
Ugh. Sorry. I'm having an aneurysm.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.291
Dinner is served, my little furry friend.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.666
Your favorite meal. Fried fish!

18:27.750 --> 18:30.916
Mm-mmm! I could get used to this, baby.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.750
I don't understand why those other cats
are scared to live with you. That's crazy.

18:34.833 --> 18:36.916
You know, I don't have the slightest.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.625
Now pardon me while I go dump this
boiling hot grease down my bathtub drain.

18:41.708 --> 18:42.541
Oh no!

18:43.125 --> 18:46.083
Huh. Looks like you got
a little burn there, huh?

18:46.166 --> 18:49.541
God damn!

18:49.625 --> 18:50.750
You mad at me?

18:50.833 --> 18:53.916
Mad? Hell, I came three times!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.375
I'm gonna like it here.

18:55.458 --> 18:58.375
Boil up another pot
and throw it right in my pussy.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.333
We're all gonna die!

19:01.416 --> 19:04.458
Quick! Let's climb up Dobby's throat
and escape out of his mouth!

19:04.541 --> 19:05.916
Have you seen this fucker's mouth?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.208
We'll never get past
all those rows of jacked-up teeth.

19:08.291 --> 19:11.250
And this inbred idiot
blew up the other exit.

19:11.333 --> 19:12.708
There's no way out of here!

19:12.791 --> 19:14.791
I know of another.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.416
Hopson, what the fuck you doing, man?

19:19.500 --> 19:20.958
He's working your son's prostate.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.208
Our son's prostate.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.541
That should be enough.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.000
Now saddle up!

19:29.083 --> 19:31.041
So, what's the plan?

19:31.125 --> 19:32.208
The plan?

19:32.291 --> 19:37.833
We'll be riding six white horses
when he comes!

19:37.916 --> 19:39.625
-Hyah!

19:46.583 --> 19:50.041
Oh, fuck yeah.

19:50.125 --> 19:55.166
And that is why I think Paradise would be
the perfect spot for Tesla's headquarters.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.875
You're going to come see
the town yourself?

19:56.958 --> 20:01.541
Well, that's wonderful news, Mr. Musk.
I-I can't wait to meet you in person.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.291
Ah! He's coming here!

20:03.375 --> 20:04.500
Feel better now?

20:04.583 --> 20:05.875
I really do.

20:05.958 --> 20:08.541
I got you your favorite
coffee drink to celebrate.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.791
Why does it say Karen on my cup?

20:10.875 --> 20:12.541
Uh, because it's your name.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.666
Bullshit! You think I'm a Karen.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.875
That is the worst slur
you could call someone!

20:19.208 --> 20:20.875
You know what? Fuck it.

20:26.416 --> 20:27.583
Great Scott!

20:27.666 --> 20:30.000
I sure am dehydrated
after ejaculating those six individuals.

20:33.708 --> 20:40.000
My dear God, if you don't want me
to touch children anymore, give me a sign!

20:43.291 --> 20:45.708
Do you have any Vietnamese signs?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.500
Don't shoot him in the face.
I wanna mount him.

20:54.583 --> 20:58.166
Please don't kill me. I'm the proud father
of a brand-new Brozone.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.833
It's a Brozone layer but spelled L-A-I-R.

21:00.916 --> 21:03.375
Think about it.
It's the best pun I ever came up with.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.083
Stop! Don't kill him!

21:05.166 --> 21:07.000
Why? They're overpopulated.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.416
Because you think
getting revenge will fulfill you,

21:09.500 --> 21:13.125
but once you've got it,
you'll realize that this was wrong.

21:13.208 --> 21:14.916
You'll just feel empty.

21:15.000 --> 21:15.958
That was beautiful.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.791
I'm still gonna kill
this fucking guy, though.

21:25.791 --> 21:27.750
No!

21:27.833 --> 21:30.875
No.

21:30.958 --> 21:34.375
The only sons I have left
are a piece of shit…

21:34.458 --> 21:35.916
…and a turd baby!

21:36.500 --> 21:39.458
Holy shit. My kid's immortal!

21:39.541 --> 21:41.125
The buck stops here.

21:41.208 --> 21:44.625
Wow. Best fucking one-liner
I've ever heard.

21:44.708 --> 21:46.500
I made that joke first!

21:46.583 --> 21:48.791
Holy shit! A talking deer!

21:52.625 --> 21:54.708
An immortal baby saves the Earth

21:54.791 --> 21:57.416
from a <i>Planet-of-the-Apes</i>-style
deer uprising

21:57.500 --> 22:00.291
and wins a cheap plastic trophy.

22:00.375 --> 22:02.708
Here to explain the baby's immortality,

22:02.791 --> 22:05.541
which will probably be important
later in the season,

22:05.625 --> 22:09.250
is the only graduate
of Trump University Medical School.

22:09.333 --> 22:11.500
Hmm… Upon examining the baby,

22:11.583 --> 22:14.916
it seems his immortality likely
has something to do with the fact

22:15.000 --> 22:17.666
that he originated
from a 15-year-old sperm

22:17.750 --> 22:19.083
that refused to die.

22:21.500 --> 22:25.583
In other news, a senile,
geriatric pervert has lost his mind

22:25.666 --> 22:28.250
and opened a ranch for giant sperm.

22:28.958 --> 22:30.791
Yeehaw!

22:31.458 --> 22:33.541
Eh. C minus.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.791
Bro, you literally
just killed me with that dance.
