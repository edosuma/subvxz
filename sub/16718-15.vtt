WEBVTT

00:05.560 --> 00:06.880
So far at...

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Will he die?

00:08.280 --> 00:10.200
Should I say it directly or
in the doctor's language?

00:10.480 --> 00:11.440
Directly.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.600
-What's your name?
-Ariel.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.840
-I am sorry.
-What?

00:14.160 --> 00:16.440
-Your dad couldn't do it.
-Shut your mouth!

00:23.360 --> 00:24.920
You are welcome to come closer.

00:26.960 --> 00:27.920
Can you hear it?

00:28.240 --> 00:30.080
Yes.  I hear you daddy

00:30.680 --> 00:31.640
I hear you.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.720
Dr.  Rorish, do you remember me?

00:36.200 --> 00:37.160
Ariel?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.200
Could we talk to each
other for a moment?

00:51.600 --> 00:53.200
Have you still not
found your aunt?

00:53.320 --> 00:56.480
Not yet, either she's dead or
she doesn't want to be found.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.040
Thank you.

00:58.760 --> 01:02.000
Ariel has had a lot of problems
over the past two years.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.400
Twice in juvenile detention, a
residential group, two foster families.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.280
Didn't you know?

01:10.160 --> 01:14.040
I wrote to see how to
do it, but lost contact.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.840
What is happening now?

01:17.280 --> 01:19.920
She comes into the care
system until the next family.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.760
- Forget it.
-When we find another one.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.960
Not many people want
to take in a 14 year old

01:27.080 --> 01:28.240
certainly not with their
previous convictions.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.120
She is still a child.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.000
She needs someone
to take care of.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.880
As I said, the other option
would be a group home.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.280
That will not do.  No.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.600
Well I'll take care of
her for a few more days

01:46.000 --> 01:48.160
then we have to find
a permanent solution.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.760
Where is she?

01:52.880 --> 01:53.760
Where is who

01:53.880 --> 01:55.400
Ariel.  She was just here.
Did you see her

01:55.600 --> 01:56.600
She still lives with you?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.200
-Where have you been?
-At the machine.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.720
Soda?  At 7 in the morning?  Nice.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.400
There are real fruits
in there, there it is.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.759
I can't sit here all day.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.160
Ariel, I asked you to stay

02:11.280 --> 02:12.480
with me at home for a few days

02:12.600 --> 02:13.480
until I sort it out.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.000
A few days in your
house are enough for me.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.160
You don't have to clarify anything.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.000
I know someone in
Oregon I can stay with.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.320
You're not going to Oregon.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.440
You can't forbid me to do anything.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.000
There must be someone
with your aunt's number.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.680
I haven't spoken
to her in a year.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.840
After the juvenile prison, she
put me in a residential group.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.600
She doesn't want
me and vice versa.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.400
Eighty-two dollars.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.480
-What?
-That's how much the bus costs.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.560
Hitchhike or you
will give me $ 82.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.840
You're not taking the bus
to see a guy in Oregon.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.720
Could you just stay
here for the day, please?

02:51.840 --> 02:53.600
-Yes?  Until I...
-until you clear it up?

02:55.360 --> 02:56.760
You're welcome.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.440
Fine

03:02.640 --> 03:04.480
According to headquarters,
this is a 55-year-old

03:04.600 --> 03:05.880
Condition after a
syncope, weak and

03:06.040 --> 03:07.640
diaphoretic, it
collapsed on the spot.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.000
Fresh heart transplant.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.920
Welcome to Angels.
What's your name sir

03:11.040 --> 03:11.800
His name is Bill.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.440
I can answer myself.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.600
Bill Chislett.  Seems to
be the pump.  It was used.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.160
-Weak pulse.
-Are you his son?

03:18.320 --> 03:20.000
The future son-in-law.
The wedding is coming soon.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.000
-We became friends...
-For heaven's sake, Jeremy.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.240
Bill, Bill!

03:25.360 --> 03:26.320
Off to the Center Stage.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.520
It was a great move.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.560
But you didn't do
the landing well.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.480
I landed on someone's
foot.  Is that my mistake?

03:34.200 --> 03:35.520
I can dance, but
nobody is that good.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.400
Ginger Rogers
did everything Fred

03:37.520 --> 03:38.880
Astaire did, backwards
and in high heels.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.240
But did she hit balls too?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.960
The main thing is that
someone here can fix my ankle.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.880
Dr.  Kean what have you got there

03:47.240 --> 03:48.520
-This is Russell.
-Gibson.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.440
Development player
for Waverly University.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.920
You are in the first
round of the draft.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.120
I like that guy.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.760
Not just first round of drafts.
Among the top ten.

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
Can you make friends later?

03:59.160 --> 04:01.160
Mr. Chislett, please
stay up, okay?

04:01.280 --> 04:04.440
Map ejection fraction
and measure BNP, please.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.840
I start with the echocardiogram.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.760
All good?

04:09.240 --> 04:10.560
He said he was
going to get the flu.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.680
I thought it was an excuse to

04:12.800 --> 04:13.880
cancel, then he
vomited and collapsed.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.399
-Anna...
-What is he saying?  Dad?

04:16.519 --> 04:17.720
-What do you have...
-Anna.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.959
-Anna?
-My fiancee.  I called.

04:21.560 --> 04:25.080
The ejection fraction is
small.  Less than 15%.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.960
-This is not the flu.
-So what?

04:29.800 --> 04:33.360
I am afraid it is your heart.
You have organ failure.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.760
Damn it.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.040
I put the central
venous catheter.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.360
I'll do this Dr.  Rorish.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.600
Let's give him 5
mg per kilogram of

04:40.720 --> 04:41.840
dombutamine and
then call Dr.  Campbell.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.560
Hold on, Bill.
I'm here, do you hear?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.760
Can he hear me

04:45.960 --> 04:46.920
Can he hear me

04:47.040 --> 04:48.280
Can you get him out of here?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.520
Jesse, can you take
Jeremy to the waiting room?

04:50.800 --> 04:53.480
Come on, buddy.
He is in the best of hands.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.000
The boy is driving me crazy.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
What are you writing to her

05:00.560 --> 05:02.040
That does not concern you.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.040
He has no idea.
I am his Cyrano.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.400
I had to cancel three
times due to work.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.480
I said he should take
her over for coffee with us.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.000
But that's lovely.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.640
But it's not romantic
in the cafeteria.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.040
Romance shouldn't be
your concern right now.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.960
But a fourth attempt.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.320
Good.  Well then.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.960
LOS ANGELES FIRE EMERGENCY
EMERGENCY VEHICLE

05:27.360 --> 05:28.520
Are you sure it's here?

05:30.400 --> 05:31.360
That was the address.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.640
Headquarters said
they were in the back.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.480
Hello.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.960
Ambulance service.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.720
Ambulance service.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.480
-The cops!
-We ask to rule them

06:01.600 --> 06:04.200
and drive them out, and He shall

06:04.360 --> 06:05.360
put out every
filthy fire in them!

06:05.480 --> 06:06.760
Drive him out, please!

06:06.880 --> 06:07.840
People?

06:07.960 --> 06:09.680
Heavenly Father defend us.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.760
Oh my God.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.480
God is not here.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.560
Leave her alone.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.520
-You don't understand.
-Now.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.440
The devil struck
her with his claws.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.680
We'll save this
child from the devil!

06:19.960 --> 06:21.520
We need the spine board.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.960
What is he saying?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.000
God is good, the devil is bad.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.400
Saint Michael, protect us...

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
Yolanda!  We are here!

06:29.800 --> 06:31.960
The perils of the devil
and his misdeeds...

06:32.080 --> 06:33.720
-She has fever.
-The pulse is weak.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.640
Can we get him out?

06:35.760 --> 06:36.720
And drive them away.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.120
Let her soul in your heaven...

06:39.240 --> 06:41.400
Push your divine
virtue into Satan and all

06:41.520 --> 06:45.040
the evil spirits that
lurk in this world.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.040
There's no money in there, in
case you've been looking for some.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.760
I wasn't looking for money.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.120
Then why are you sniffing around?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.000
Are you a doctor
and don't have $ 82?

06:56.240 --> 06:57.920
-Ariel, we need to talk.
-About what?

06:59.400 --> 07:00.800
I called the youth welfare office.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.600
-For real?
-Maybe they will find some...

07:03.720 --> 07:04.880
I didn't come for
you to betray me.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.600
No, I am not going
back to the care system.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.680
Maybe they can find
a family member...

07:09.800 --> 07:11.800
I don't need anyone to
take care of me.  I'm okay.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.000
Your dad wouldn't want
you to be alone in Oregon.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
Don't talk about my father.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.560
I know how hard
the loss was for you.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.040
And I know how
much you miss him.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.240
No i don't miss him.
I don't even remember.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.520
I do not believe you.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.760
Who cares what you think?

07:27.640 --> 07:28.800
I shouldn't have come here.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.520
Wait.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.600
Ariel.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.760
Ariel?

07:46.440 --> 07:47.680
OK.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.080
It starts.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.600
The balloon pump is in place.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.800
If it's in, can I go?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.280
The balloon re-opens your aorta,

08:01.040 --> 08:02.000
but you are not cured.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.680
Mr. Chislett, you
still have heart failure.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.760
Do you understand?

08:05.880 --> 08:07.280
But I took the medication.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.200
This happens in
10% of all cases.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.720
Your body rejects the new heart.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.440
This will buy you time
until we find a new one.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.080
How long?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.640
The heart should buy me
time until Anna's wedding.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.360
Your mother passed away.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.080
I can't let her get
married without her dad.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.360
I've thought about it,

08:34.799 --> 08:36.320
maybe you could help
me with the chemistry class.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.440
Are there no tutors for this?

08:38.799 --> 08:41.280
I'm less interested in
chemistry... more in...

08:41.400 --> 08:42.360
...Reply.

08:43.640 --> 08:44.640
I am not helping you cheat.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.920
That's the least, Dr.  K.,
you made me wait so long.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.280
We are busy.
Waiting is part of it.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.200
He needs an x-ray.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.960
Sure you don't just
want me around longer?

08:56.240 --> 08:58.640
-Come on, dude!
-Sorry, did that hurt?

09:00.000 --> 09:00.960
He doesn't need an x-ray.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.040
He has pain in his ankle and
cannot put any weight on it.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.200
I am familiar with the Ottawa Directive.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.640
It's a sprain, not a break.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.240
The radiology is overcrowded.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.200
It is done that way in a team.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.400
They want the admission.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.600
Good.  Fine

09:17.120 --> 09:18.120
You can have it.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.000
Dr.  Rorish.  A 20 year old,
altered state of consciousness.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.520
Your blood pressure is falling steadily.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.280
Let's fix it so that it
doesn't hurt itself or others.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.520
Systolic blood
pressure is at 90.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.280
-What happened to her?
-Exorcism.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.800
For real.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.280
Add 1 liter of nutrient
fluid and vasopressors.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.200
They said she had the flu
a few days ago, developed

09:49.320 --> 09:52.560
a fever and then got
aggressive and confused.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.800
Did you call the surgery?

09:54.160 --> 09:55.360
Yes.  Gallstones.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.720
Sono and ultrasound
show pericholecystic fluid.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.640
Is it psychiatric?

10:01.480 --> 10:04.000
She has a fever of 40 degrees.
Definitely an infection.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.080
Dr.  Dixon?

10:05.520 --> 10:07.600
Meningitis or encephalitis.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.880
We need to do a
spinal tap to be sure.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.000
It could be rabies.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.280
Rabies?

10:12.440 --> 10:14.040
I like it when you
push boundaries.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.600
Cases of rabies are very rare.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.400
Your gallbladder is inflamed.
She has to go to the operating room.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.400
Au... what the...

10:22.720 --> 10:24.560
Get haloperidol quickly.
Hurry up!

10:25.280 --> 10:27.360
Continue.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.600
-Hi!
-Kelly.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.000
That doesn't sound good.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.600
I...

10:38.840 --> 10:40.160
I didn't know you were coming.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.600
You wanted me to
come  I answered you.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.560
For real?  I...

10:46.680 --> 10:47.640
I don't have it...

10:47.920 --> 10:49.080
I didn't see it.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.040
You know what?  I just go again.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.280
No, I'll be finished soon.

10:53.400 --> 10:58.600
I have a couple of files to
close.  Are you waiting?  Sorry?

11:00.640 --> 11:02.040
-Yes.
-OK.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.760
I'll be right back

11:10.680 --> 11:11.640
Forgiveness.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.800
I am looking for my girlfriend.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.800
She was brought
here a few hours ago.

11:15.920 --> 11:16.920
Her name is Yolanda.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.000
Are you a relative?

11:18.240 --> 11:20.040
No, she no longer
speaks to her family.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.880
Then I am not allowed to say
anything about her condition.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.840
But she's alive, right?

11:25.880 --> 11:28.240
She lives.  We do what we can.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.920
She would have had to
go to the hospital sooner.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.240
Your friend called and
dragged me into the matter.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.320
Why didn't you finish it?

11:37.720 --> 11:38.840
I do not know.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.160
It all got out of hand.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.480
You saw it.
They said she was obsessed.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.760
She obviously wasn't.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.240
She needed a doctor.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.680
Yolanda, are you conscious?

11:56.240 --> 11:57.280
The haloperidol works.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.880
We may never see
another rabies case.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.960
If that's not a great lesson.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.480
Ow!  Is that really necessary?

12:05.640 --> 12:06.600
Dr.  Dixon?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.880
Inject rabies immunoglobulin
directly into the wound...

12:10.240 --> 12:11.760
Sugar bears, I swear.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.880
Jesse, did she have these
wounds when she arrived?

12:18.600 --> 12:19.720
I did not notice them.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.080
You inject like a
doctor in the first year.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.160
You are a great patient.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.360
Keep still.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.880
Leanne, what color
is the spinal fluid?

12:45.400 --> 12:46.360
Black.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.560
It's not rabies.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.160
What?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.240
Both of you, step away.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.640
Mario, get away from Heather.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.720
Everyone in the Center
Stage who doesn't

12:55.840 --> 12:57.320
have to be here has
to leave immediately.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.480
Go ahead.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.000
What's the matter?

13:00.120 --> 13:01.080
Dr.  Willis?

13:01.240 --> 13:02.440
The emergency room
must be quarantined.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.160
Initiate the Infectious
Disease Protocol.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.640
Please talk to me.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.120
The guards should lock up,
nobody in or out!  Right away!

13:13.640 --> 13:14.600
What's happening?

13:19.040 --> 13:20.160
Hemorrhagic fever.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.960
We need epidemic
protection here.  Right away.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.320
DISEASE PROTECTION

13:46.520 --> 13:47.640
Right this way.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.040
BIO HAZARD

13:55.160 --> 13:56.360
Listen up people

13:58.000 --> 13:59.120
This area is contaminated.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.960
All infected people must
be quarantined in this tent,

14:03.280 --> 14:04.840
they are looked after by the
epidemic protection agency.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.120
This is Dr.  Gretchen Reed,
Epidemiologist, CDC, San Diego.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.520
Dr.  Willis.  CCCRP.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.880
This is a real acronym party.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.320
Thank you for calling us.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.480
How many were exposed?

14:15.720 --> 14:17.400
Two with symptoms.
A confirmed exposure.

14:17.720 --> 14:18.800
My surgeon was bitten.

14:19.640 --> 14:20.880
-Bitten?
-Bitten.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.560
OK.  Depersonalization.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.080
The bleeding
causes blood clots in

14:26.200 --> 14:27.680
the brain, and only
the brain stem works.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.120
The patient's personality
no longer exists.

14:30.680 --> 14:34.080
All that's left is
coughing, spitting... biting.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.520
Where are they?

14:38.200 --> 14:39.240
I'll show you.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.600
Yolanda is already in the tent.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.800
They're taking Alicia with them now.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.840
No!

14:47.600 --> 14:48.640
No!

14:51.040 --> 14:53.080
Where are you
taking me  Help me!

14:53.200 --> 14:54.680
As for your first question,

14:54.800 --> 14:56.120
therefore fixations are necessary.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.520
If she hadn't been scared

14:57.640 --> 14:58.680
beforehand, it would
have been easier.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.840
Trust me, nobody goes
into the hot zone willingly.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.880
Stop it, okay?  Stop.
I'm not going into the tent.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.160
-As I said.
-Hey stop!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.160
Stop!

15:07.480 --> 15:08.440
Dr.  Rorish!

15:11.040 --> 15:12.000
Do something.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.320
-Dr.  Rorish!
-I'm sorry, Heather.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.840
General, Dr.
According to Reed, we

15:23.960 --> 15:25.600
have the entire hospital
under quarantine.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.480
I was in contact with
the Ministry of Defense.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.800
Members of the National Guard
come as a security measure.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.600
Is that important?

15:33.240 --> 15:34.960
If that's like what
I saw in Guinea...

15:36.240 --> 15:37.480
You were there for
the Lassa outbreak?

15:38.640 --> 15:39.600
How many survived?

15:40.360 --> 15:41.880
This can be very different.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.960
How many?

15:44.840 --> 15:45.800
Nobody.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.680
Can you confirm
that it is not airborne?

15:47.840 --> 15:49.600
Yes, it is probably
transmitted through body fluids.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.480
Is It Treatable?

15:51.960 --> 15:53.640
We don't know until
we know the virus.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.440
But we don't have a lot of time.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.000
Patient Zero was
healthy 36 hours ago.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.240
Her friend got the
symptoms eight hours ago.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.720
It's aggressive.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.160
Dr.  Pinkney's time is running out.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.440
Our main task is
support and testing

16:08.720 --> 16:10.120
of everyone who might
have been exposed.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
There are over 100 people
in the waiting room alone.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.720
How do you test
an unknown virus?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.200
You look for antibodies.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.360
Real-time polymerase chain
reaction would take too long.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.520
Start with an IgM
antibody blood count.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.480
Those with symptoms

16:23.680 --> 16:25.360
should be in the hot
zone for monitoring.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.440
All right, Colonel Wilson,
please keep me informed.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.680
We have a problem
with containment.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.720
There were others present
where we found the infected.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.000
We have to go back there.
Right away.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.160
Her name is Ariel.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.080
The break room, the cafeteria.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.360
Then take them to my office.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.480
What are you hiding from us?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.360
When will you open
the hospital again?

16:48.480 --> 16:51.840
Doctors, please start
drawing your blood.  Now.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.800
We need the blood tests from
everyone here, from the team first.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.160
There is a phlebotomy
station in the back corridor.

16:57.640 --> 17:02.040
Wear protective suits
at all times.  And smile!

17:02.360 --> 17:05.480
Everyone must stay calm.
So do we.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.520
Or at least we pretend, yes?

17:08.359 --> 17:09.319
That will also work.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.040
Does anyone have Dr.  Seen kean?

17:15.040 --> 17:16.680
Will they let us
out of here soon?

17:17.880 --> 17:19.040
It's been hours now.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.560
You just play it safe.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.640
If I have the virus,
is it treatable?

17:28.840 --> 17:30.080
I know as much as you do.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.440
Not that I mind
personal treatment.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.440
How long have you
had these twitches?

17:45.960 --> 17:46.920
Some days.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.520
That hinders my performance.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.360
Dilated pupils, fever,
sweating, twitching.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.760
Do you take any medicine?

18:00.000 --> 18:00.960
-What?
-You are not sick.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.960
They have a
pharmacological response.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.600
Nothing!

18:04.760 --> 18:05.720
Speed?  Amphetamine?

18:06.000 --> 18:06.960
What?  No!

18:07.240 --> 18:08.880
Russell, tell me the truth.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.640
-I'm taking sertraline.
-How much?

18:13.040 --> 18:14.280
One tablet a day
according to the recipe.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.360
Do you take more?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.680
You are nervous, have
memory and concentration

18:19.840 --> 18:20.840
problems in addition
to the symptoms.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.800
It is a doom-loop.
School, play, stress.

18:23.960 --> 18:24.920
Russell.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.040
Well ok  I just take a few

18:28.160 --> 18:29.400
extra pills for
my concentration.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.480
What's in it?

18:30.640 --> 18:32.040
That your brain goes crazy

18:32.160 --> 18:33.360
with too much serotonin.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.240
But the drug is
supposed to help.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.160
Too much causes symptoms
it is supposed to fight.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.640
You create the vicious circle.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.560
So, quarantine?

19:25.280 --> 19:26.600
We test all of them.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.400
I feel good.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.800
I know.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.280
She doesn't look like
someone getting well.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.640
How long has she been sick?

19:38.120 --> 19:39.080
For 38 hours.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.680
Maybe 48.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.200
And I'm now in the 12th hour?

19:51.200 --> 19:52.280
I do not give up.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.160
Do you hear?

19:58.880 --> 19:59.920
Neither do I.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.480
You have to press on it.  Yes?

20:31.360 --> 20:33.960
Hey, come on, buddy.
Don't push ahead.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.640
Like in school, all the
way back.  Come on.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.440
Okay guys.  Listen up

20:38.560 --> 20:41.920
Kelly, I'm so sorry about this.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.520
You had no idea about
the potential pandemic.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.120
No!  Let me go.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.840
Forgiveness.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.280
Come.  Forgiveness.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I'm getting out of here.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.120
I can't let you go

20:56.240 --> 20:57.880
Sir, back again.
I'm serious.  Back.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.160
Sir please

20:59.960 --> 21:01.800
Ariel, take it easy, okay?

21:02.240 --> 21:03.200
What's happening?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.320
She wants to get out of quarantine.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.800
I know Leanne Rorish.
I am allowed to go.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.800
-That's definitely not true.
-And you're not in charge.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.400
Ariel.  Put this on.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.760
Nobody goes.
No matter who you know.

21:12.920 --> 21:13.960
I should never have come here.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.120
You are here now.

21:15.480 --> 21:16.560
Nothing can change that.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.640
-Were you tested?
-No.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.880
You haven't been tested yet?

21:20.560 --> 21:22.440
Come along.  We let you test.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.560
Here.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.440
-I've been waiting for hours.
-All right.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.040
I've got to get out of here.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.200
Sorry.  Take it easy.
Everything will be fine.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.640
How is bill  I am not
allowed to see him.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.960
He relaxes.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.480
But heart failure is serious...

21:47.600 --> 21:50.760
Jeremy, he's stable.
OK?  Where is Anna?

21:51.160 --> 21:53.480
She's stuck here in
quarantine.  Your battery is dead.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.080
That is the rule.
We have to keep people there.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.760
Can she come in here or not?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.960
-If we can find her...
-Moment.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.040
It could be her.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.440
Hello?  Oh dear.
No, it's stable.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
How does she get in here?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.520
I'm at the bar.
Come and find me.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.000
I'm here at the bar.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.720
Ok i love you

22:18.480 --> 22:19.960
What... what's going on here?

22:20.960 --> 22:22.720
Yolanda?  Hey...

22:26.040 --> 22:28.440
Dr.  Pinkney, I can take over.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.200
I can do it. I need more fluids!

22:37.000 --> 22:38.520
She has been passed
out for 20 minutes.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.680
Check the pulse.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.920
No no...

22:53.640 --> 22:55.800
Time of death, 8.46 p.m.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.920
No, Yolanda!

23:00.840 --> 23:01.800
Yolanda...

23:05.000 --> 23:06.120
No, Yolanda.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.000
Its my fault.
I thought I would help her.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.880
You tried  They
brought her here.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.960
OPEN

23:24.360 --> 23:25.720
I don't know why
he's smiling like that.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.120
There were three
during the exorcism.

23:28.760 --> 23:29.720
I'm sure they're all gone.

23:30.920 --> 23:31.880
Or dead.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.080
We should collect
fluid when we find it.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.000
Alright

23:38.240 --> 23:39.200
Question.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.680
Why were you there so quickly?

23:43.040 --> 23:44.600
We had an assignment on the west

23:44.720 --> 23:46.520
coast and were able
to react immediately.

23:56.920 --> 23:57.920
There is liquid here.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.320
Over here.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.640
She is dead.

24:58.720 --> 24:59.880
There's someone else here.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.880
He is dead.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.160
Help me.

25:17.720 --> 25:21.000
Blood pressure is at 74. He
needs vasopressors and fluids.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.600
Dr.  Willis, this
won't save this man.

25:22.760 --> 25:23.880
We have to make it easy for him.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.400
My job is to keep him alive.

25:28.880 --> 25:29.920
Anna, where are you now?

25:30.120 --> 25:31.400
I am in the waiting area.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.280
I do not see you.
Come to the counter.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.640
Doesn't work,
it's blocked there.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.080
-Outside?
-I see you.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.280
-Where?
-Over here.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.880
Dr.  Guthrie!  She is here.

25:41.000 --> 25:41.960
I want a bag.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.000
-Anna.
-Jeremy.  Is he still...

25:45.440 --> 25:46.400
He's still alive.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.160
How do i get in

25:49.400 --> 25:51.040
You have to wear
this for safety reasons.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.440
It's potentially
dangerous in here.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.720
I don't care.
I have to see my dad.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.920
He is in me.  Listen to me

26:06.160 --> 26:08.320
A demon is a general

26:08.880 --> 26:10.880
who is in command
of lower demons.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.160
He is in the final
reinforcement phase.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.040
You should fight for more time.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.760
We have to fight
for more time for

26:16.880 --> 26:17.840
everyone here until
we have vaccine.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.800
I agree with you.
But you're wasting your time.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.000
He is dead.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.440
Begin chest compressions.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.200
We have three dead who
had contact with Yolanda.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.120
Measured by their mortality,
the virus kills in 48 hours.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.720
Alicia is the only
survivor so far.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.720
But she is noticeably worse off.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.720
When was she
exposed to the virus?

26:50.440 --> 26:51.520
About 29 hours ago.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
PATIENT NAME ALICIA DAVIS

26:53.000 --> 26:53.960
TIME SINCE EXPOSURE 29:00:00

26:54.080 --> 26:56.400
This is the top priority.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.240
PATIENT ZERO

26:59.360 --> 27:00.720
Do you think it's
from someone else?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.320
Nothing in Yolanda's history

27:02.440 --> 27:04.040
indicates how she
was exposed to this.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.360
So is another vector out there?

27:09.440 --> 27:10.480
You know you...

27:13.120 --> 27:14.160
You forget a name.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.240
I will not forget him.

27:23.160 --> 27:27.200
Heather became
infected shortly after 8 a.m.

27:28.120 --> 27:31.240
It's 1:21 pm.  That's 17 hours.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.800
PATIENT NAME HEATHER PINKNEY

27:34.240 --> 27:35.800
TIME SINCE EXPOSURE 17:00:00

27:39.280 --> 27:40.240
What can we do?

27:40.360 --> 27:41.440
We're already doing everything.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.360
We offer supply,
liquid, electrolytes,

27:46.120 --> 27:47.280
controlling blood pressure.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.680
We want access to all
dialysis machines you have.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.560
That's it, okay?

27:54.520 --> 27:56.920
Heather dies and we
look at the damn watch.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.280
We don't just look at them.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.880
We do what we can.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.360
What's this?

28:05.040 --> 28:06.680
Your employees'
blood test results.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.080
You three are healthy.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.520
But some of your
employees are infected.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.200
That's incredible.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.200
Look, we haven't given up hope.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.120
And neither should you.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.320
Can someone call my mom?

29:22.680 --> 29:24.680
I have a cell phone.
We'll call you together.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.840
What shall we do now?

29:32.720 --> 29:33.680
Our job.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.080
Our job?

29:35.520 --> 29:38.200
We help the patient and
each other as best we can.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.640
Yes we can do this.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.440
Yes.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.880
Bill Chislett's medical record?

30:04.800 --> 30:06.520
Hey hey...

30:07.240 --> 30:08.200
It will be alright.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.640
No.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.880
None of this is good.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.560
Listen to me.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.080
He knows how you feel about him.

30:21.760 --> 30:22.720
I promise you.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.400
I promise it.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.160
Bill, good news.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.920
Someone here wants
to say hello to you.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.400
-Hey, Anna!
-Daddy!

30:47.320 --> 30:48.400
Anna, honey.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.280
Are you all right?

30:51.400 --> 30:53.320
There was a little
problem with my new heart.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.200
But I'll get well again.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.480
He is already on the
nationwide recipient list.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.120
All good things are two.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.560
I'm getting a new heart and I'm

31:03.680 --> 31:06.080
coming to the
wedding as planned.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.600
I have to confess something.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.240
Jeremy and I don't play squash.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.840
We took dance lessons.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.520
Wait what?

31:21.400 --> 31:23.240
-Dance lessons?  You?
-Leave me.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.880
It's not easy for me either.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.800
Jeremy organized that.

31:28.160 --> 31:31.360
Jeremy?  My Jeremy
organized dance lessons?

31:32.760 --> 31:35.560
Jeremy knew how
important it is to me

31:38.520 --> 31:41.480
dancing with my little
one at their wedding.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.280
He's not that bad after all.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.480
I told you that.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.120
Where's jeremy?

32:02.400 --> 32:03.960
Come along.
You don't have an infection.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.400
They let you leave the hospital.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.760
I'm sorry about your friends.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.600
We can do it.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.840
Yes I know.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.760
Hey... are you alright?

32:14.640 --> 32:15.960
We brought an
infected person here.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.480
And I've been so
close to her and my

32:17.600 --> 32:20.040
friends are in
quarantine and I'm here.

32:20.280 --> 32:21.520
I am fine.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.760
I would trade with
them right away.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.280
You drive yourself
crazy thinking that way.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.600
They need you with a clear head.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.200
-What?
-When all of this is over

32:33.600 --> 32:34.840
let's drink the damn coffee.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.560
Dr.  Leighton!

32:41.720 --> 32:43.320
-Go!
-I can help.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.120
Kelly, go. Don't
risk exposure to this.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.400
Please go.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.840
Well, all hands on one side.
Go to the side.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.840
She has a high fever.
The temperature is at 40.5.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.280
She is on her way to hell.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.640
Hey, sugar bears.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.200
I know you hate the nickname.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.960
I'm starting to like him.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.320
And you too.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.960
Stop flirting with me.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.880
Heather?  Help!  Over here!

33:33.960 --> 33:35.080
I need help here!

33:36.040 --> 33:37.000
Heather.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.480
Heather.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.640
Heather, look at me.
She barely has a pulse.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.000
It's only been 24 hours.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.440
-Blood pressure is at 70 to 32.
-Three-lumen catheter.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.320
-You have to fight, Heather.
-Get it to me at once.

33:47.440 --> 33:48.840
-Suction.
-We have to fix them.

33:49.000 --> 33:49.960
You have to fight now.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.920
She wakes up.  Stop
intubation.  Heather?

34:01.600 --> 34:03.040
Heather, can you talk to us?

34:04.520 --> 34:05.800
Heather?  Can you talk to us

34:06.360 --> 34:07.320
Heather?

34:09.120 --> 34:10.320
Put another entrance.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.400
Heather, stay awake.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.199
Let's intubate them.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.360
Does the blood pressure level up?

34:21.960 --> 34:22.960
Yes.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.480
Well, I'm in.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.880
It was only 24 hours.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.280
The bite brought the virus
directly into her bloodstream.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.440
The saturation increases.

34:40.719 --> 34:41.719
Your blood pressure too.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.280
Stay away from the patient.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.040
Who are you?

34:47.360 --> 34:49.080
Dr.  Willis, this is the CDC's

34:49.199 --> 34:50.719
vice director, Dr.
Gareth Reddick.

34:50.840 --> 34:51.760
I don't care who he is.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.880
Dr.  Pinkney is our
colleague and our friend.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.520
And she is doing
very badly right now.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.160
Do we already know
what we are dealing with?

34:57.280 --> 34:59.160
Yes, that's why I'm taking over.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.960
All patients are tested who
can walk without any findings.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.120
Nobody goes.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.640
The Angels Memorial
is under lock and key.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.800
The National Guard is
responsible for securing the building.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.480
What about the infected?

35:09.760 --> 35:12.800
The CDC takes care of the
treatment and Dr.  Pinkneys included.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.120
-We do not leave you alone.
-But.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.600
You have a hospital
full of patients.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Yes?  This is your business.
The virus is mine.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.120
No.

35:21.840 --> 35:22.800
Want...

35:23.800 --> 35:25.360
Will, she's stable.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.240
Can you take over ventilation?

35:32.640 --> 35:33.600
Forgiveness.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.440
I do that.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.200
Ariel?

35:57.160 --> 35:58.120
Leanne!

36:00.360 --> 36:01.360
They say I'm sick

36:01.600 --> 36:03.560
-Go back.
-You're welcome...

36:03.680 --> 36:07.560
- Stay away.
-I do not want to go away!

36:07.680 --> 36:08.760
It'll be all right, dear.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.560
Stay away!

36:11.800 --> 36:13.160
-I won't leave her alone.
-Leanne.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.240
-I won't leave her alone!
-Leanne.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.720
Leanne.

36:22.000 --> 36:22.960
Let's go.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.320
What's happening?

36:57.760 --> 36:58.760
Can I ask to dance?

37:43.360 --> 37:44.840
I love you.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.000
Rule one, don't harm anyone.

37:59.560 --> 38:02.200
Respect the doctors in
whose footsteps I am following

38:02.680 --> 38:05.400
and like to share the
knowledge with those who follow.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.120
Remember that I don't
deal with nudes or illnesses

38:09.600 --> 38:10.720
but a sick person.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.960
And if I'm supposed to
take care of her properly

38:13.400 --> 38:14.440
I also look after the family.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.560
Remember, medicine is art
and science at the same time.

38:20.760 --> 38:24.000
And warmth, compassion,
and understanding can

38:24.120 --> 38:25.520
be more important
than the surgeon's knife

38:25.640 --> 38:27.120
or the pharmacist's medicine.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.200
I have to go in there.  She dies.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.920
-I have to go in there!
-Want!

38:36.320 --> 38:37.840
She will die no
matter what we do.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.080
But she shouldn't die alone.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.000
She is not alone.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.880
Treat carefully when it
comes to life and death.

39:31.640 --> 39:34.120
This wonderful
responsibility must be shared

39:34.240 --> 39:37.120
To be met humility and the
knowledge of my weakness.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.800
That I may show
the best of my calling.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.040
And so that I may
long experience

39:45.160 --> 39:46.720
the joy of healing
those who ask for help.
