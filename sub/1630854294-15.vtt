WEBVTT

00:21.448 --> 00:22.620
Today is a big day

00:22.620 --> 00:24.241
because we'll be
one step closer

00:24.241 --> 00:26.896
to passing rocks
and making money.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.068
<i>28-year-old
Parker Schnabel</i>

00:30.068 --> 00:34.000
<i>is on the brink
of a new chapter
in his career.</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:36.551
As we run out of ground
in the Yukon,

00:36.551 --> 00:40.724
it'd be nice
to have had a season or two
under our belt and say,

00:40.724 --> 00:41.862
"Okay, here's the score.

00:41.862 --> 00:44.827
Here's what the ground
is like in Alaska."

00:44.827 --> 00:46.758
You've got to keep your mind
on the future, right?

00:48.793 --> 00:50.827
<i>Just 12 years ago,</i>

00:50.827 --> 00:53.275
<i>the 16-year-old mining prodigy</i>

00:53.275 --> 00:56.965
<i>took over his grandpa John's,
Alaskan claim.</i>

00:56.965 --> 00:58.827
Yesterday,
we ran a 140.

00:58.827 --> 01:01.103
- You run a 140 yards?
- Yesterday.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.724
We did. He knows. I don't.

01:03.724 --> 01:06.724
<i>But it wasn't long
before he outgrew it.</i>

01:06.724 --> 01:09.103
If I wanted to play
with the big boys,

01:09.103 --> 01:11.172
I've got to get up here
where the big boys play.

01:13.103 --> 01:17.448
<i>Now he runs
one of the biggest operations
in the Klondike,</i>

01:17.448 --> 01:22.344
<i>where his team is plowing
through 90 acres this season.</i>

01:22.344 --> 01:25.551
<i>Mitch and Tyson
have their hands full
with two plants running.</i>

01:25.551 --> 01:28.758
<i>And quickly
running out of ground.</i>

01:28.758 --> 01:31.862
<i>There's serious concern about
the future of the company</i>

01:31.862 --> 01:34.758
<i>and for us to be able
to keep mining.</i>

01:34.758 --> 01:37.000
<i>To secure his future.</i>

01:37.000 --> 01:39.758
<i>Parker's gambling hundreds
of thousands of dollars</i>

01:39.758 --> 01:42.000
<i>on a new claim back in Alaska.</i>

01:44.206 --> 01:45.827
<i>Early tests indicate</i>

01:45.827 --> 01:49.172
<i>it could hold over $10 million
in gold</i>

01:49.172 --> 01:51.344
<i>and keep them mining
for years to come.</i>

01:52.965 --> 01:55.206
<i>If it pays out this summer.</i>

01:56.517 --> 01:59.275
We're hoping to do
1,000 ounces here.

01:59.275 --> 02:00.862
We have a lot of stripping
to do, though.

02:00.862 --> 02:04.241
So in the meantime,
we've just been stockpiling
old drift tailings.

02:04.241 --> 02:05.793
So hopefully
there's lots of gold in them.

02:10.517 --> 02:14.655
<i>Parker has split
his Alaskan Greenhorns in two.</i>

02:14.655 --> 02:17.965
<i>His Wolf Cut crew
is opening Virgin Ground,</i>

02:17.965 --> 02:20.000
<i>holding high grade pay,</i>

02:20.000 --> 02:23.620
<i>but it's 30 feet down
and will take weeks
to get to.</i>

02:25.206 --> 02:28.068
<i>Across the claim,
his Drift Cut crew</i>

02:28.068 --> 02:30.034
<i>is on the hunt
for a quick score</i>

02:30.034 --> 02:32.241
<i>to bankroll
the whole operation.</i>

02:35.000 --> 02:38.344
<i>The wash plant
we've leased is coming to site</i>

02:38.344 --> 02:41.103
<i>and this is the pad
it's gonna sit on.</i>

02:42.862 --> 02:45.275
<i>I hate leasing wash plants</i>

02:45.275 --> 02:47.482
<i>and it's never worked out well
when I've leased them,</i>

02:47.482 --> 02:50.896
<i>but the plant
we are getting built
isn't ready yet.</i>

02:50.896 --> 02:53.000
<i>We're gonna have
this wash plant coming in</i>

02:53.000 --> 02:55.724
and then we'll be ready
to sluice this pile over here.

02:55.724 --> 02:58.241
So there'll be plenty
for the plant to do.

02:58.241 --> 02:59.275
<i>We've got to get it
going here.</i>

03:01.068 --> 03:04.655
<i>Overseeing the setup of Parker's
leased wash plant.</i>

03:04.655 --> 03:07.103
<i>New foreman, Mark Forrs.</i>

03:07.103 --> 03:09.655
<i>We're always excited
when we have new people
showing up,</i>

03:09.655 --> 03:14.172
you know, and fresh chance
at finding another ace guy.

03:14.172 --> 03:16.379
Mark, you want to move forward
just a little bit?

03:19.137 --> 03:20.965
It's also a chance
at finding a big dud.

03:22.379 --> 03:25.000
You know, the biggest issue
is that Mitch isn't here.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.172
I need somebody
that I trust
to take this on.

03:31.241 --> 03:34.275
The next thing here
will be putting
this wash plant on the pad

03:34.275 --> 03:36.793
and we'll see
how she sets up there.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.172
That's level
right there.

03:51.172 --> 03:52.275
Nice.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.379
Good job, Mark.

03:53.379 --> 03:55.103
It's perfect.

03:55.103 --> 03:58.172
Good job.
First big piece is in place.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.586
Got it up here
without flipping it.

03:59.586 --> 04:01.000
Didn't even go in the pond.

04:04.103 --> 04:05.206
Good job.

04:05.206 --> 04:06.275
Now the conveyor.

04:07.862 --> 04:10.689
Grab that ratchet strap
right there and just
throw that on there.

04:22.862 --> 04:26.344
We're gonna go six inches out
that way.

04:26.344 --> 04:29.758
<i>Parker's
counting on his leased
Red Rocket wash plant</i>

04:29.758 --> 04:32.793
<i>running a 150 yards an hour.</i>

04:32.793 --> 04:35.241
<i>But first,
Mark needs to maneuver</i>

04:35.241 --> 04:37.827
<i>in the 20-foot
tailings conveyor.</i>

04:39.068 --> 04:40.275
Is that gonna fit?

04:40.275 --> 04:41.448
We'll see.

04:43.931 --> 04:46.103
He needs to go down
a little more, right?

04:46.103 --> 04:49.310
Yeah. This end needs
to go that way Parker,
like about a foot?

04:49.310 --> 04:50.965
Yeah, it can't,
because he needs to go down

04:50.965 --> 04:52.310
because the screen deck's
in the way.

04:52.310 --> 04:53.448
Oh,

04:53.448 --> 04:54.758
Let me have a look at this.

04:57.551 --> 04:59.068
Oh, you piece of [bleep].

05:01.793 --> 05:03.206
You're on the wrong side
of some pipe.

05:04.448 --> 05:05.517
That'll never work.

05:05.517 --> 05:07.068
We got a piece
of steel in our way.

05:12.620 --> 05:13.827
This is

05:16.551 --> 05:18.827
These things come off.

05:18.827 --> 05:20.344
Oh, [bleep] that's it.

05:20.344 --> 05:22.103
You have to take
the outside ones out.

05:22.103 --> 05:23.862
That helps a lot.

05:23.862 --> 05:25.551
<i>Obstacle out of the way.</i>

05:25.551 --> 05:27.931
<i>Mark can lift the conveyor
into position.</i>

05:30.931 --> 05:35.000
Stay down.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.310
It's not on me.

05:37.448 --> 05:39.827
I'm not trying
to kill you. I promise.

05:39.827 --> 05:41.034
You're not the first.

05:42.482 --> 05:43.827
There we go.

05:43.827 --> 05:45.413
<i>The final piece,</i>

05:45.413 --> 05:49.172
<i>the four-tonne hopper
that will feed paydirt
into the plant.</i>

05:51.103 --> 05:52.758
All right.
Out that way a little bit.

05:53.931 --> 05:55.379
There you go.

05:55.379 --> 05:56.793
That's dead nuts.

05:56.793 --> 05:58.344
Oh, I just need a rock.

05:58.344 --> 05:59.586
Yukon hammer.

06:07.655 --> 06:09.000
- Let's go.
- Fire it up.

06:10.034 --> 06:11.241
This coming together.

06:11.241 --> 06:12.586
See if the thing works.

06:17.655 --> 06:20.000
- Mark, you ready?
- Oh, yeah.

06:28.482 --> 06:29.793
You've got to be kidding me.

06:30.965 --> 06:32.551
This [bleep] always happens.

06:37.862 --> 06:39.137
Come on.

06:41.206 --> 06:42.724
Now we're getting somewhere.

06:48.413 --> 06:50.551
You want me to throw
the first scoop in?

06:50.551 --> 06:51.655
Yeah.

06:51.655 --> 06:54.586
All right, let's make
some money or lose more.

06:55.689 --> 06:57.758
<i>Two years
in the making.</i>

06:57.758 --> 07:01.586
<i>Parker's Alaskan mine
is finally up and running.</i>

07:01.586 --> 07:03.344
All right,
here's the first scoop
going in.

07:04.655 --> 07:07.758
<i>He's one step closer
to finding out</i>

07:07.758 --> 07:10.965
<i>if his new operation
will secure his mining future.</i>

07:12.206 --> 07:13.482
It's good to be sluicing,

07:13.482 --> 07:15.655
but I'm just nervous
about the ground.

07:15.655 --> 07:18.586
It's drifting.
So we didn't drill it.

07:18.586 --> 07:20.000
We have no idea
what's gonna happen.

07:27.275 --> 07:30.172
<i>300 miles south.</i>

07:30.172 --> 07:36.103
<i>A veteran miner
enters a new era
on his own Alaskan claim.</i>

07:36.103 --> 07:39.413
<i>I started my mining career
13 years ago in Alaska.</i>

07:39.413 --> 07:43.103
Last year we pulled
463 ounces out of here

07:43.103 --> 07:44.758
and it was a good year.

07:44.758 --> 07:50.758
<i>63-year-old
Dozer Dave Turin is back
at his Glacier Creek mine.</i>

07:52.689 --> 07:54.689
<i>This is the worst winter
they had on record.</i>

07:54.689 --> 07:56.827
It gave us
a really late start.

07:56.827 --> 07:59.310
<i>Gonna be some big changes
for Team Turin this year,</i>

07:59.310 --> 08:00.793
<i>and I hope my guys
are up for it.</i>

08:02.413 --> 08:04.000
Let's find some gold.

08:05.758 --> 08:08.586
<i>After seven years
with the Hoffmans.</i>

08:08.586 --> 08:09.758
I can't believe it.

08:09.758 --> 08:11.620
Dave just saved
our mining season.

08:11.620 --> 08:14.103
<i>Dave formed
his own crew.</i>

08:14.103 --> 08:15.241
A-team.

08:17.655 --> 08:18.758
<i>And mined...</i>

08:18.758 --> 08:20.965
I'll bet you that gold
sits right on here.

08:20.965 --> 08:23.137
<i>All over
North America.</i>

08:23.137 --> 08:24.620
Oh, my goodness.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.517
<i>Hitting gold
in Colorado.</i>

08:26.517 --> 08:27.862
Twenty six pounds of gold.

08:27.862 --> 08:29.172
That's unbelievable.

08:29.172 --> 08:30.862
Let's see what we got.

08:30.862 --> 08:34.000
<i>And last season
at Glacier Creek.</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:35.655
It's a hell
of an achievement.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.137
We worked our asses off
for that.

08:39.931 --> 08:42.137
<i>But after personal tragedy.</i>

08:42.137 --> 08:43.241
Oh [bleep] here we go.

08:43.241 --> 08:45.000
There's three of them
coming right now.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.482
- What? Who is it?
- Jesse. Heart attack.

08:48.965 --> 08:51.034
<i>And the departure
of key crew.</i>

08:51.034 --> 08:53.758
Hey, Chris.
How's it going?

08:53.758 --> 08:55.793
I need to talk to you.

08:55.793 --> 08:57.000
I'm leaving.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.103
Whoa.

08:58.103 --> 09:02.137
<i>Team Turin
now faces an uncertain future.</i>

09:05.137 --> 09:07.172
I just don't know
why we're coming
this late in the year.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.689
That's, that's why
I just don't get it.

09:08.689 --> 09:11.482
I'm with you. But he said
it's worth our while.

09:12.862 --> 09:16.000
<i>Dave's called
in his most trusted
crew members,</i>

09:16.000 --> 09:20.103
<i>mechanic Nathan Clark
and operator Jason Sanchez,</i>

09:20.103 --> 09:21.724
<i>to discuss what's next.</i>

09:27.655 --> 09:28.724
Huh!

09:28.724 --> 09:30.000
All right. Boys are here.

09:32.068 --> 09:33.482
Oh, there's big Daddy Dave.

09:33.482 --> 09:35.034
There is Big Daddy Dave.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.482
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

09:36.482 --> 09:37.655
I'm good.

09:37.655 --> 09:38.862
Man. I'm good.

09:38.862 --> 09:40.586
Oh, man.
Good to see you.

09:40.586 --> 09:41.655
We made it.

09:41.655 --> 09:43.000
- I know...
- Come my man.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.758
Good to have you here.

09:45.758 --> 09:47.551
Yeah. Look at you.

09:47.551 --> 09:48.862
Sure. Glad you guys are here.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.448
I really appreciate
you guys coming.

09:50.448 --> 09:51.931
What's your plan?

09:51.931 --> 09:54.586
Well, Shelly
and I've been thinking
about it a lot,

09:54.586 --> 09:57.724
and we're about ready
to sell this thing.

10:00.862 --> 10:02.000
I'm sorry. What?

10:03.655 --> 10:04.965
The investor backed out...

10:06.034 --> 10:08.379
so I got nobody else
but Shelly.

10:08.379 --> 10:11.000
And we want
to sell the claims,
the equipment.

10:14.206 --> 10:16.448
It's time, we've been doing
this a long time.

10:16.448 --> 10:17.655
Little bit shocking.

10:19.758 --> 10:20.965
Where does that leave us, though?

10:22.827 --> 10:24.689
Well, that's why
I brought you here.

10:24.689 --> 10:26.620
If there's anybody
I got to sell this to,

10:26.620 --> 10:28.103
I'd rather it be you.

10:32.724 --> 10:34.275
I mean, what kind of money
we're talking about?

10:34.275 --> 10:35.862
Well, a million bucks.

10:35.862 --> 10:39.413
There's a ten-year
lifespan here.

10:39.413 --> 10:41.103
Ten years is not a bad deal.

10:43.896 --> 10:45.793
This is a great opportunity
for you guys.

10:45.793 --> 10:47.482
There's good gold here.

10:47.482 --> 10:50.241
You know, for, for me
to start putting
a lot of money into it,

10:50.241 --> 10:51.482
I've got to know
what's all here.

10:51.482 --> 10:53.965
At the very least,
we should chase that out.

10:53.965 --> 10:55.793
If you don't believe in it,

10:55.793 --> 10:58.551
why don't the three of us
find out where the gold is?

10:58.551 --> 11:01.137
Then you guys can make
an intelligent decision.

11:01.137 --> 11:04.068
And if it's right for you,
you guys can be owners.

11:04.068 --> 11:05.413
This is your opportunity.

11:09.137 --> 11:10.172
What do you think?

11:12.827 --> 11:14.620
I guess, something
definitely to think about.

11:14.620 --> 11:17.448
But let's do what the rest
of this ground actually has,

11:17.448 --> 11:19.103
sounded like a plan.

11:19.103 --> 11:21.206
Sounds pretty fair to me
right now.

11:21.206 --> 11:22.827
- Yeah.
- Let's, let's do it, Dave.

11:22.827 --> 11:25.000
- Everybody in?
- Always.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.517
- All right.
- Sounds good.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.137
Definitely not the news
I expected.

11:30.137 --> 11:32.000
I got to stick a shovel
in the ground

11:32.000 --> 11:34.931
before I can even begin
to really wrap my head around

11:34.931 --> 11:37.586
what Dave and Shelly
just presented to us.

11:37.586 --> 11:39.379
It's gonna accomplish
a lot of things.

11:39.379 --> 11:41.275
It's gonna make them
feel comfortable

11:41.275 --> 11:44.034
that what they're buying
is really legitimate

11:44.034 --> 11:46.931
and it's gonna prove there's
ten-years' worth of gold.

11:46.931 --> 11:49.344
And if not, we'll try
to sell it elsewhere.

11:49.344 --> 11:51.241
So, yeah, we're gonna go
dig some dirt

11:51.241 --> 11:52.793
one last time
for Team Turin.

11:55.793 --> 11:59.862
<i>To prove
there's a golden future
for Jason and Nathan,</i>

11:59.862 --> 12:04.827
<i>Dave first needs to get
all his machines
over the creek to the claim.</i>

12:04.827 --> 12:07.862
<i>Starting with his prospecting
wash plant.</i>

12:07.862 --> 12:09.310
<i>The Beetle.</i>

12:09.310 --> 12:10.931
It's all good.
We're good to go.

12:18.586 --> 12:20.620
All right.
Nate looks good, buddy.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.448
You made it.

12:22.448 --> 12:24.000
I've got an excavator.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.482
It's not going to get
across that bridge.

12:25.482 --> 12:27.931
So, let's see if we can
get across the river.

12:31.344 --> 12:33.103
This river is pretty high.

12:33.103 --> 12:34.896
You think it's gonna make it?

12:34.896 --> 12:36.241
It has to Dave.

12:36.241 --> 12:39.172
When you come across,
put your bucket out there.

12:39.172 --> 12:42.034
Kind of feel the depth
and watch out for big rocks.

12:46.793 --> 12:48.344
I'll take it real easy.

12:48.344 --> 12:50.103
I'll feel out ahead of myself.
Good call.

12:53.379 --> 12:55.724
All right.
Let's see what it does.

12:55.724 --> 12:57.344
No big rocks.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.793
Here we go.

13:03.689 --> 13:04.965
It's pretty good
so far.

13:06.344 --> 13:08.655
If it starts getting up
into that cab.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.896
We'd better just back out.

13:10.896 --> 13:13.517
The water comes in, floods,
all these electronics.

13:13.517 --> 13:17.344
And I could be a duck
out of water, so to speak.

13:17.344 --> 13:20.344
You're sunk
halfway up your tracks.

13:20.344 --> 13:21.793
Come on, now.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.344
Now your tracks
are getting under the water.

13:28.344 --> 13:30.793
You got about another foot.
It's about all you got.

13:30.793 --> 13:31.931
Come on.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.896
I got a little bit
of depth there.

13:36.896 --> 13:39.103
You're...

13:39.103 --> 13:41.344
I can't see
behind me it'd be all right?

13:41.344 --> 13:43.413
You're about ready
to tip over, I think.

13:43.413 --> 13:45.896
Take it easy.
You almost got water
in the cab.

13:56.448 --> 13:58.034
Yeah. Water coming now.

13:58.034 --> 14:00.344
You're about ready
to tip over I think.

14:00.344 --> 14:02.034
<i>At Glacier Creek,</i>

14:02.034 --> 14:07.206
<i>Team Turin are crossing
a raging river
to access Dave's claim.</i>

14:07.206 --> 14:09.000
Just let her go.
I'm gonna go.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.448
Going, going, going.
Across the line.

14:11.448 --> 14:14.172
Across the line,
near cross there.

14:14.172 --> 14:17.413
All right. You got it.
You got it. Yeah, buddy.

14:17.413 --> 14:19.896
Hey, when in doubt,
throttle up.

14:19.896 --> 14:21.206
All right.

14:21.206 --> 14:23.344
We got us an excavator.

14:23.344 --> 14:24.758
All right, boys.
Let's get after it.

14:25.896 --> 14:28.068
What we gotta do next
is dig some holes,

14:28.068 --> 14:29.896
put some paydirt in here
and find some gold.

14:58.896 --> 15:01.482
<i>Over halfway
through his season,</i>

15:01.482 --> 15:02.896
<i>King of the Klondike,</i>

15:02.896 --> 15:06.586
<i>Tony Beets is gambling
on a monster pay day</i>

15:06.586 --> 15:09.551
<i>from two of the deepest cuts
of his mining career.</i>

15:23.448 --> 15:27.931
<i>So far,
Tony's mined just
over 2,000 ounces of gold,</i>

15:27.931 --> 15:31.724
<i>but he's down to his
last few weeks of thawed pay.</i>

15:50.517 --> 15:52.586
Huh. Steady.

16:10.551 --> 16:12.172
What about Eighty Pup?

16:15.862 --> 16:17.689
Yeah. All you have to do
is dig a drain,

16:17.689 --> 16:19.551
and you can get to drain it.

16:22.034 --> 16:23.413
Oh, I know.

16:26.896 --> 16:30.275
Yes. A lot of that
nice white stuff, too.

16:30.275 --> 16:32.000
<i>Mike's idea.</i>

16:32.000 --> 16:34.482
<i>Go back and look
for white channel pay</i>

16:34.482 --> 16:36.793
<i>in a section
of the Eighty Pup</i>

16:36.793 --> 16:38.724
<i>that was stripped last season,</i>

16:38.724 --> 16:40.551
<i>but then flooded
and abandoned.</i>

16:41.724 --> 16:43.724
<i>If the pay streak's
down there,</i>

16:43.724 --> 16:46.241
<i>it lies under 20 feet
of water.</i>

17:12.413 --> 17:14.275
Yeah. You already got
one of the walls built,

17:14.275 --> 17:16.344
and then you got
to build up one side,

17:16.344 --> 17:17.551
and you're pretty much
good to go.

17:28.862 --> 17:31.379
Oh, don't worry.
I'll make sure I get it
all nice and clean.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.206
Yes. Yeah. Okay.

17:36.206 --> 17:37.655
Okay. Dad, I'll go get
my time machine.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.310
<i>To drain
the Eighty Pup,</i>

17:42.310 --> 17:46.275
<i>Mike needs to pull off
a massive engineering feat</i>

17:46.275 --> 17:49.896
<i>and build
the biggest settling pond
on Paradise Hill.</i>

17:52.551 --> 17:54.724
<i>First, they must strip
the perimeter</i>

17:54.724 --> 17:58.000
<i>of a 25-acre section
of ground for the pond.</i>

17:59.103 --> 18:03.241
<i>Next, build a mile-long dike
around the pond,</i>

18:03.241 --> 18:06.068
<i>which will also form
a 20-foot wide road.</i>

18:07.344 --> 18:10.206
<i>Then, lay
a 1,000 foot mega pipe</i>

18:10.206 --> 18:13.344
<i>from the flooded 80 pump cut
to the edge of the hill.</i>

18:14.931 --> 18:18.965
<i>Finally, pump
10 million gallons of water
through the pipe</i>

18:18.965 --> 18:21.689
<i>and let it flow down the hill
to the pond.</i>

18:26.172 --> 18:29.344
<i>Tony wants it done
in just five days.</i>

18:40.000 --> 18:42.206
This thing is designed
to [bleep] ground.

18:48.344 --> 18:51.655
<i>While Mike strips
the pond perimeter.</i>

18:51.655 --> 18:53.137
Keep it coming.

18:53.137 --> 18:56.172
<i>Cousin Mike,
directs rock trucks
hauling in gravel</i>

18:56.172 --> 18:57.448
<i>to build the dike.</i>

19:00.172 --> 19:01.482
Dump it there.

19:01.482 --> 19:03.448
<i>Fine tailings mixed
with gravel.</i>

19:03.448 --> 19:04.758
<i>And it's really good
for building</i>

19:04.758 --> 19:06.931
because it has the fine sand
in it.

19:06.931 --> 19:09.241
And when you drive on it,

19:09.241 --> 19:11.862
it packs and it becomes
really hard.

19:11.862 --> 19:14.655
<i>This season,
Tony's lost precious hours</i>

19:14.655 --> 19:17.689
<i>using iron from the cuts
to build dikes.</i>

19:19.275 --> 19:20.517
<i>To speed things up,</i>

19:20.517 --> 19:25.517
<i>he's invested $700,000
on two new secret weapons.</i>

19:28.931 --> 19:30.758
<i>Belly scrapers.</i>

19:32.413 --> 19:37.241
<i>Hitched to a couple
of 469-horsepower rock trucks.</i>

19:37.241 --> 19:42.137
<i>Tony's new toys are ideal
for building dikes and roads.</i>

19:47.448 --> 19:48.655
Oh.

20:06.793 --> 20:09.034
<i>A 12-foot blade underneath</i>

20:09.034 --> 20:13.344
<i>scrapes and flattens
the gravel into a smooth road.</i>

20:35.310 --> 20:36.551
Not too bad.

20:44.517 --> 20:48.137
Yeah, I just have to get
used to it and then
it's working fine.

21:07.551 --> 21:09.517
Tony just hit me
with his counterweight.

21:09.517 --> 21:10.758
That's not good.

21:25.413 --> 21:27.344
Tony just hit me
with his counterweight.

21:27.344 --> 21:29.551
That's not good.

21:29.551 --> 21:33.517
<i>On Paradise Hill,
while racing to build
the new pond,</i>

21:33.517 --> 21:35.448
<i>Tony Beets has collided</i>

21:35.448 --> 21:40.344
<i>with one of his brand new
$350,000 belly scrapers.</i>

21:43.068 --> 21:44.620
I just got hit by Tony.

21:47.448 --> 21:49.275
Because
there's not a lot of room.

21:49.275 --> 21:53.000
I was really close to him
and I thought he knew

21:53.000 --> 21:55.275
because a couple of times
it went really well.

21:55.275 --> 21:58.517
And then when I left, I think

21:58.517 --> 22:00.241
he forgot that I was there
or something.

22:00.241 --> 22:01.413
But then he hit me.

22:15.344 --> 22:16.724
<i>After a close call,</i>

22:16.724 --> 22:18.931
<i>Tony's belly scraper is back</i>

22:18.931 --> 22:21.413
<i>to finishing the pond
to drain the cut.</i>

22:58.310 --> 22:59.448
Christopher?

23:01.206 --> 23:02.344
Christopher?

23:03.482 --> 23:05.344
Time to wakey wakey,
eggs and bakey.

23:11.103 --> 23:12.758
I'm gonna go make sure
everybody else is up. Okay.

23:14.517 --> 23:15.965
Yeah. You're ready.
Five minutes.

23:20.793 --> 23:23.310
<i>Over half way
through his season,</i>

23:23.310 --> 23:27.344
<i>third-year mine boss,
Fred Lewis is fighting
for survival.</i>

23:29.137 --> 23:30.758
<i>This year...</i>

23:30.758 --> 23:32.655
Our entire claim is under ice.

23:34.103 --> 23:36.000
<i>He's battled
the collateral damage</i>

23:36.000 --> 23:38.931
<i>from one of the worst
Yukon winters on record.</i>

23:38.931 --> 23:41.103
I've never seen this much snow
in my life.

23:41.103 --> 23:43.758
<i>And faced breakdown
after breakdown.</i>

23:43.758 --> 23:45.206
Oh

23:45.206 --> 23:47.344
<i>In an unforgiven wilderness.</i>

23:49.379 --> 23:52.448
This is definitely
not gonna work.

23:56.103 --> 23:57.689
<i>For all of his efforts,</i>

23:57.689 --> 24:00.310
<i>Fred has mined just 50 ounces.</i>

24:00.310 --> 24:03.103
You know, I've set a massive
500-ounce goal this season.

24:03.103 --> 24:05.034
That's five times
what we had last season.

24:05.034 --> 24:08.206
We're gonna have to hit it
hard to get close to that.

24:08.206 --> 24:11.448
Winter's already knocking
on the door about halfway
through the season,

24:11.448 --> 24:14.931
but we're gonna fight
until Mother Nature
kicks us out.

24:14.931 --> 24:17.827
We can't get more gold
if we can't put
more yards through.

24:19.482 --> 24:20.620
Yardage, yardage, yardage.

24:22.655 --> 24:24.413
<i>To turn
around his season.</i>

24:24.413 --> 24:26.862
<i>Fred is calling in reinforcements.</i>

24:26.862 --> 24:29.103
I've managed
to convince somebody

24:29.103 --> 24:31.448
and it was not easy
to come up here.

24:31.448 --> 24:34.724
This guy has fed the plant
before in Oregon.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.344
He's been through the [bleep].

24:36.344 --> 24:38.896
He's the exact person
I need to do this

24:38.896 --> 24:40.758
and I'm pretty
freaking stoked.

24:47.827 --> 24:49.758
<i>On the road
to California Creek.</i>

24:51.862 --> 24:55.413
<i>You got to realize
what Fred and I have
is not a friendship.</i>

24:56.724 --> 24:58.586
<i>Friendship only goes so far,
you know.</i>

24:59.827 --> 25:02.655
What Fred and I have
is brotherhood.

25:06.965 --> 25:08.344
<i>Fred's newest recruit.</i>

25:10.034 --> 25:13.172
<i>Master Sergeant,
Stefan Generally.</i>

25:13.172 --> 25:14.517
You know a brother ask you,

25:15.965 --> 25:18.310
"I need you to come do
this. I need some help."

25:18.310 --> 25:20.793
You know, he, he asked.
I'm there.

25:22.379 --> 25:23.482
I'm here.

25:25.620 --> 25:29.172
<i>Stefan fought alongside
Fred in Afghanistan.</i>

25:29.172 --> 25:31.068
<i>Stefan is one
of my best friends.</i>

25:31.068 --> 25:32.896
<i>He's always gonna be
one of my best friends.</i>

25:32.896 --> 25:35.586
He's proven to me
in life or death
that he can have my back.

25:35.586 --> 25:37.344
So, he's gonna have
my back anywhere.

25:38.551 --> 25:39.827
Two years ago.

25:39.827 --> 25:41.448
- Whoo.
- Hoo-hoo.

25:41.448 --> 25:45.103
<i>The brothers in arms
dug for gold in Oregon.</i>

25:45.103 --> 25:46.586
- You guys in?
- One, two.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.206
All right, let's go
get some gold.

25:48.206 --> 25:49.482
Yeah.

25:49.482 --> 25:51.724
<i>But after
a disappointing season.</i>

25:51.724 --> 25:53.551
It's looking like
I ran out of pay.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.551
<i>Stefan threw
in his shovel</i>

25:55.551 --> 25:57.724
<i>and hasn't been
on a mine since.</i>

25:57.724 --> 26:00.241
I say we cut and run.
Quit while we're ahead.

26:03.379 --> 26:07.206
I mean, Fred told me that
he's got a great crew of guys,

26:07.206 --> 26:10.758
he's got a great mine site,
good equipment,

26:10.758 --> 26:13.034
which is a far cry
from what we had in Oregon.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.034
Damn.

26:25.068 --> 26:26.413
There she is.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.103
Everybody's at...

26:33.517 --> 26:36.034
Only one [bleep] damn person
knocks that loud.

26:36.034 --> 26:37.379
Something!

26:37.379 --> 26:38.758
How you doing, man?

26:38.758 --> 26:40.068
Oh, you made it.

26:40.068 --> 26:41.206
You like that drive?

26:41.206 --> 26:43.034
Dude, I thought you gave me
a wrong direction.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.206
I'm like this "Where?

26:44.206 --> 26:45.862
I mean, how high up
can we go?"

26:45.862 --> 26:47.965
Not much higher.
They call this
top of the world.

26:47.965 --> 26:50.655
- Yeah.
- What we've got here,
got a great group of guys.

26:50.655 --> 26:53.862
They're willing to work
their asses off all day,
every day.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.275
And we're pulling gold
out of the ground.

26:55.275 --> 26:57.655
It's a beautiful place
to live.

26:57.655 --> 26:59.931
I love it. I love it.

26:59.931 --> 27:01.275
You're gonna be
surprised, dude.

27:03.034 --> 27:04.206
I know I keep saying that.

27:05.620 --> 27:08.862
<i>Stefan will be joining
the crew in the Freedom Cut.</i>

27:10.758 --> 27:14.724
<i>To get anywhere close
to Fred's 500-ounce goal,</i>

27:14.724 --> 27:18.896
<i>they need to hit over
50 ounces every week.</i>

27:18.896 --> 27:20.655
Throw that on.

27:20.655 --> 27:22.172
Refreshed recruits.

27:22.172 --> 27:23.586
Uh, he's a fresh recruit.

27:23.586 --> 27:24.931
This is Buzz.

27:24.931 --> 27:26.103
- I'm not fresh.
- What's up, brother?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.206
- How are you doing?
- Stefan.

27:27.206 --> 27:28.758
- Buzz is our foreman?
- Nice to meet you, bro.

27:28.758 --> 27:29.896
JB, this is Stefan.

27:29.896 --> 27:31.310
Stefan,
what's going on, man?

27:32.758 --> 27:33.793
- How you doing?
- Hey.

27:33.793 --> 27:35.206
Good to have
another SF guy here.

27:35.206 --> 27:37.482
- Hey, man.
- All right.
Let's get to work.

27:37.482 --> 27:38.655
Gold don't find itself.

27:38.655 --> 27:40.241
No, man. Unfortunately.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.586
We're gonna start you out
feeding the wash plant.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.482
You know, I kind of feel like

27:45.482 --> 27:47.103
it's best to just throw him
right into it,

27:47.103 --> 27:49.655
get him wet, get him dirty,
get him miserable

27:49.655 --> 27:51.689
<i>because it's gonna be
that way the whole season.</i>

27:51.689 --> 27:53.896
<i>Here's your freaking job
and let's get at it.</i>

27:55.241 --> 27:57.034
You're welcome.

28:00.551 --> 28:01.862
And she's rolling.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.448
Bucket number one.

28:10.862 --> 28:12.862
<i>To up Fred's yardage,</i>

28:12.862 --> 28:17.206
<i>Stefan must keep
the paydirt flowing through
wash plant Sergeant sluice.</i>

28:20.655 --> 28:23.275
Just go real easy.
You'll feel it.

28:23.275 --> 28:24.517
- Okay.
- Just be gentle.

28:27.379 --> 28:28.448
I got this.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.827
<i>Just like jump in the deep end
of the pool and swim.</i>

28:32.827 --> 28:34.793
You know, I didn't come here
to tread water.

28:34.793 --> 28:36.551
I came here to work.

28:39.413 --> 28:40.517
It's a hard job.

28:40.517 --> 28:42.310
It's something you have
to pay attention to do.

28:42.310 --> 28:44.448
Watch your rocks going in
and big rocks.

28:44.448 --> 28:48.275
We cannot be dropping
large-sized boulders
in that hopper.

28:48.275 --> 28:49.931
That plant can't handle it.

28:49.931 --> 28:52.793
<i>Sergeant Sluice
has no grizzly bars</i>

28:52.793 --> 28:54.517
<i>to filter out boulders,</i>

28:54.517 --> 28:56.758
<i>so Stefan feathers
the bucket</i>

28:56.758 --> 29:01.137
<i>releasing dirt slowly
to stop anything big
clogging the plant.</i>

29:03.000 --> 29:06.034
Fred wants this plant
to run continuously.

29:06.034 --> 29:09.034
And I came here to do
what he wants done.

29:09.034 --> 29:10.172
Make this [bleep] happen.

29:10.172 --> 29:11.448
So we can all make some money.

29:14.103 --> 29:16.448
Oh, oh.

29:16.448 --> 29:18.172
A big rock just went in there.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.241
I don't want
to shut the plant down.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.965
Yeah. It looks like I got
a huge rock right up front.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.103
Oh, it's a big bastard.

29:36.137 --> 29:38.793
<i>If Stefan can get
the rock out quickly,</i>

29:38.793 --> 29:41.620
<i>they'll avoid having
to shut down completely.</i>

29:42.862 --> 29:45.000
Oh, what you got? No.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.655
I'm trying to figure out
what, J...

29:49.965 --> 29:51.344
I need, I need the teeth.

29:51.344 --> 29:52.758
I got you.
Hold on.

29:52.758 --> 29:53.862
Bring your teeth.

29:53.862 --> 29:57.137
So he's telling me to use
the teeth to empty it,

29:57.137 --> 30:00.689
and he can't use the teeth
if I got
in the bucket.

30:00.689 --> 30:03.137
I need to empty it,
it's full.

30:05.344 --> 30:08.517
JB is trying to instruct me
on how to clear it.

30:08.517 --> 30:10.724
I know what to do, but I want
to make sure he's...

30:10.724 --> 30:13.448
Just give me a minute.
I need to...
I need to empty it.

30:13.448 --> 30:14.586
That's the problem.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.551
You're not [bleep] let me
empty the bucket, homey.

30:18.620 --> 30:20.103
All right.
Now I can use the teeth.

30:46.172 --> 30:47.482
Got it?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.620
<i>Stefan's cleared
the rock</i>

30:59.620 --> 31:01.862
<i>and avoided a plant shutdown,</i>

31:01.862 --> 31:04.862
<i>keeping the Lewis crew
on the gold.</i>

31:04.862 --> 31:08.379
Time is money,
so we really don't have
that much time to waste.

31:08.379 --> 31:11.275
So I got to really pay
attention to what I'm doing.

31:11.275 --> 31:14.034
I'm here to do
what needs to be done
so that we can get gold.

31:30.241 --> 31:32.413
Let's dig some holes,
do some panning

31:32.413 --> 31:34.758
and see if we start running
some paydirt.

31:34.758 --> 31:36.448
Okay.

31:36.448 --> 31:39.758
<i>Dozer Dave Turin
is on a mission</i>

31:39.758 --> 31:41.758
<i>to sell
his Glacier Creek claim.</i>

31:42.965 --> 31:45.620
<i>He needs to prove
to potential buyers,</i>

31:45.620 --> 31:50.482
<i>former crew members
Nathan Clark
and Jason Sanchez.</i>

31:50.482 --> 31:54.344
<i>There's more than ten years
of good gold left here.</i>

31:54.344 --> 31:56.517
I'll pick the spot landowner.

31:56.517 --> 31:58.275
Okay.

31:58.275 --> 31:59.344
Mine boss.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.551
Yeah. Let's go
get some dirt, buddy.

32:06.482 --> 32:08.862
<i>Last year,
Team Turin mined</i>

32:08.862 --> 32:11.758
<i>five acres of ground
at Glacier Creek,</i>

32:11.758 --> 32:17.517
<i>including the sunlight cut
and found 463 ounces of gold.</i>

32:17.517 --> 32:21.551
<i>Now, Nathan and Jason
want to test more ground</i>

32:21.551 --> 32:24.620
<i>to see if more gold
has washed downstream</i>

32:24.620 --> 32:28.586
<i>in the remaining 50 acres
of mineable virgin ground</i>

32:28.586 --> 32:33.689
<i>before buying
Dave's turnkey operation
for $1 million.</i>

32:38.965 --> 32:41.413
This is probably
my favorite part, you know?

32:41.413 --> 32:43.034
I mean,
I love the prospecting,

32:43.034 --> 32:44.965
but because
we go down river,

32:44.965 --> 32:46.586
you know,
we always fear.

32:46.586 --> 32:48.827
The further away
from sources you go,

32:48.827 --> 32:52.172
the less gold you're gonna
start to really see.

32:52.172 --> 32:55.310
So I'm gonna punch
my first hole
on the lower end,

32:56.344 --> 32:57.862
and I want to dig
a second hole.

32:59.172 --> 33:01.413
And then on to a third one.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.344
Let's run a pan
from here and mine.

33:03.344 --> 33:04.551
See what we got.

33:06.965 --> 33:09.241
Well, let's see
what the gold situation is.

33:11.137 --> 33:13.275
First pan of the season
right here.

33:17.034 --> 33:18.965
The gold was upstream.

33:18.965 --> 33:21.689
We proved that last season.

33:21.689 --> 33:24.172
We just didn't prove anything
from the lower end.

33:24.172 --> 33:25.689
Matter of fact,
this is the first time

33:25.689 --> 33:29.103
anybody from our team
has dug this far down river.

33:30.689 --> 33:33.241
I really want
10 to 15 colors of pan.

33:35.965 --> 33:40.827
We got one, two, three, four,
five. Tiny little pieces.

33:42.241 --> 33:45.517
But there's not enough gold
here to justify a test
from it.

33:45.517 --> 33:46.793
Let's go get another one.

33:48.862 --> 33:52.827
I don't know
if I would have chose
this property last season.

33:52.827 --> 33:56.620
I just don't know
if this is where I want to be.

33:57.655 --> 33:58.655
I really don't.

34:02.931 --> 34:05.896
The thing I noticed different
about the hole number two,

34:05.896 --> 34:07.724
it was straight
into boulders clicking.

34:10.206 --> 34:11.379
Pan number two.

34:15.586 --> 34:17.862
This is a much better
looking pan. I mean, really.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.896
Ten good visual
particle-sized pieces of gold,

34:23.896 --> 34:27.448
not to mention, and probably
another 15 micros.

34:27.448 --> 34:29.103
Significantly better pan.

34:29.103 --> 34:32.000
This pan tells me
that we're gonna run this.

34:33.448 --> 34:34.551
One more to go.

34:36.655 --> 34:40.344
<i>Dave sets up
his portable wash plant,
the Beetle,</i>

34:40.344 --> 34:42.551
<i>to run a bulk test
of the holes.</i>

34:45.344 --> 34:46.896
We're good.

34:46.896 --> 34:48.551
Sluice is on.

34:48.551 --> 34:50.517
Conveyor's on.

34:50.517 --> 34:52.620
We got water.
We're ready to go.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.517
Now we just got to fire it up,

34:54.517 --> 34:56.689
get the trommel turning

34:56.689 --> 34:58.034
and get some dirt here.

34:58.034 --> 35:00.344
Hey, I got all three of them
holes done.

35:00.344 --> 35:03.068
Good.
Had gold in every pan.

35:03.068 --> 35:05.344
Why don't you jump
in the loader? Haul the pay.

35:05.344 --> 35:07.448
You jump in the excavator
and then you feed.

35:07.448 --> 35:08.551
All right.

35:17.655 --> 35:19.344
All right, guys,
we're rolling.

35:19.344 --> 35:21.379
All right, here we go ahead.

35:21.379 --> 35:23.241
The first bucket
of our prospects.

35:26.448 --> 35:30.068
<i>Dave plans
to run ten yards of pay
through the wash plant</i>

35:30.068 --> 35:32.034
<i>from each
of the three test holes.</i>

35:34.793 --> 35:36.620
I've always wanted
my own claim,

35:36.620 --> 35:39.068
but, you know, we've got
to be able to see
the very edge of the property

35:39.068 --> 35:40.275
to the very front
of the property.

35:40.275 --> 35:41.517
We've got to see
if the values hold.

35:41.517 --> 35:43.344
If the values don't match up,

35:43.344 --> 35:44.827
you know,
it might not be worth it.

35:47.068 --> 35:48.655
I don't know
how it's gonna work out.

35:48.655 --> 35:49.862
It might be a [bleep].

35:51.172 --> 35:53.344
All right, guys,
here comes the last one.

35:53.344 --> 35:54.586
Hole number one.

35:56.206 --> 35:58.310
I feel the three of us
are changing.

35:58.310 --> 36:00.206
I'm trying to hand it over,

36:00.206 --> 36:01.689
<i>and they're trying
to figure out,</i>

36:01.689 --> 36:03.241
<i>is this what I want to do?</i>

36:03.241 --> 36:06.206
<i>Do I want to be a mine owner?
Do I want to spend money?</i>

36:06.206 --> 36:09.931
But right now, we're just
three guys having some fun,

36:09.931 --> 36:13.068
mining and let's see
what happens.

36:13.068 --> 36:14.379
<i>I love working
with these guys.</i>

36:15.793 --> 36:20.310
All right, Dave,
that was the last bucket
from hole number one.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.931
All right, I'll shut her down
and let's pull them out.

36:28.448 --> 36:31.172
So we'll take the masks,
knock them out,
put them in a tote,

36:31.172 --> 36:34.379
and then put them right
back in and start up
for number two.

36:38.517 --> 36:39.827
Throttle's coming on.

36:51.827 --> 36:53.172
All right.

36:53.172 --> 36:55.275
Let's pull the maps
one more time, guys.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.758
10-4, senor.

36:57.758 --> 36:59.172
Let me put it down.
I'll be over.

37:01.206 --> 37:02.758
What do you think, Jason,
how's it look?

37:02.758 --> 37:03.862
See anything?

37:06.517 --> 37:09.379
You know, I'm actually seeing
a little bit of gold in here.

37:09.379 --> 37:10.862
Well, that ain't bad
you guys.

37:10.862 --> 37:14.482
This is out of hole number two
which showed
the strongest pan.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.620
Well, let's go do
hole number three.

37:16.620 --> 37:17.931
- Yeah,
- Let's finish this up.

37:26.413 --> 37:32.103
Well, dirt definitely
stays consistent everywhere
on this property.

37:32.103 --> 37:34.379
This plant seems
to be eating it up
like butter.

37:39.793 --> 37:40.965
All right, gentlemen.

37:40.965 --> 37:44.241
It's gonna be the last scoop
from hole number three

37:44.241 --> 37:45.758
and our prospect's over.

37:45.758 --> 37:47.241
We can get some results now.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.896
All right, Jason's out here.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.793
Clean him out.
Get out of here.

37:55.793 --> 37:58.103
Let's get that concentrate
to Shelly

37:58.103 --> 37:59.344
and see how much gold
we got in here.

38:02.862 --> 38:04.931
Let me see
what these holes hold, Jason.

38:04.931 --> 38:06.275
Hey. Good job.

38:06.275 --> 38:08.379
- Yeah.
- The Beetle road again, bud.

38:08.379 --> 38:09.620
Yeah, it's awesome
to see it ride.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.344
All right. Good job, guys.

38:11.344 --> 38:13.172
I just don't know
how it's gonna work out,

38:13.172 --> 38:15.034
but we have to see the value.

38:16.413 --> 38:18.896
<i>We saw gold,
which is a great sign.</i>

38:18.896 --> 38:21.068
It's been a good day,
good run,
and it was a lot of fun.

38:40.172 --> 38:44.413
So far, things are actually
going pretty well.

38:44.413 --> 38:47.137
<i>Parker Schnabel
has finally fired up</i>

38:47.137 --> 38:49.586
<i>his new Alaskan operation.</i>

38:49.586 --> 38:52.068
<i>And with two plants
running in the Klondike,</i>

38:52.068 --> 38:56.068
<i>he's on track for his first
triple gold way of the season.</i>

38:58.103 --> 38:59.689
It's basically
what we're doing
in this season

38:59.689 --> 39:03.827
is testing this area
and seeing how it goes.

39:03.827 --> 39:07.793
<i>While Parker
focuses on opening up
Virgin Ground,</i>

39:07.793 --> 39:10.448
<i>mine boss in training,
Tyler Mahoney</i>

39:10.448 --> 39:15.413
<i>has got the Red Rocket
running at 120 yards per hour.</i>

39:15.413 --> 39:17.586
Right now
we've been running tailings,

39:17.586 --> 39:19.724
which is good because
there's a [bleep] ton to run.

39:21.517 --> 39:24.896
<i>Parker's gambling
on running old timers tailings</i>

39:24.896 --> 39:28.103
<i>to bankroll
his Alaska operation.</i>

39:28.103 --> 39:30.137
I think overall,
we're doing really well.

39:30.137 --> 39:33.379
But there's always
this underlying anxiety of,

39:33.379 --> 39:34.620
for me, something going wrong

39:34.620 --> 39:35.758
and me not knowing

39:35.758 --> 39:38.551
how to fix it
or troubleshoot it.

39:38.551 --> 39:43.068
Back home, if something goes
wrong, it's only me
and my family I'm impacting,

39:43.068 --> 39:45.793
which is, you know,
it's still [bleep] up,

39:45.793 --> 39:47.896
but it's always
that added of pressure

39:47.896 --> 39:49.827
when it's someone else's
operation.

39:53.517 --> 39:56.137
It will be nice seeing
some color in those boxes.

40:05.965 --> 40:07.206
Oh [bleep].

40:10.413 --> 40:12.275
That's not safe.

40:12.275 --> 40:13.758
All right.

40:27.931 --> 40:29.379
The trommel stopped shaking.

40:29.379 --> 40:30.724
Now I get to go see what's up.

40:40.068 --> 40:42.482
Mark, you got copy?
Mark?

40:44.655 --> 40:46.034
The belt is broke.

40:48.241 --> 40:49.896
Yes. Yes, it is.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.310
Hey, Tyler is here.
I can tell her.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.000
- Tyler?
- Yes. What's going on?

40:58.000 --> 41:02.068
All right. The belt
on the shaker
snapped in half.

41:02.068 --> 41:04.000
Oh. [bleep] Okay.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.655
The breakdown
with the belt is bad.

41:05.655 --> 41:08.103
It's basically like
one of the key elements
of the whole shaker deck.

41:08.103 --> 41:09.310
It moves the shaker deck.

41:09.310 --> 41:10.517
Without it, we can't sluice.

41:10.517 --> 41:12.758
There's just no way around it.
It's not great.

41:23.310 --> 41:26.241
Hey, Wayne,
we've got a bit
of an emergency out here.

41:26.241 --> 41:27.758
<i>At Cleary Creek,</i>

41:27.758 --> 41:32.137
<i>Tyler Mahoney is desperately
trying to get
Red Rocket back running</i>

41:32.137 --> 41:35.758
<i>before Parker finds out
it's shut down.</i>

41:35.758 --> 41:36.965
So we got
hold of Wayne.

41:36.965 --> 41:39.103
He's just getting
a replacement belt now.

41:39.103 --> 41:42.931
<i>Luckily,
wash plant owner
Wayne Peppler lives nearby.</i>

41:42.931 --> 41:44.034
All right, Mark.

41:44.034 --> 41:45.344
Just the guy
we're looking.

41:45.344 --> 41:46.827
Two new belts.

41:46.827 --> 41:49.827
Hopefully, we can remedy
kind of why it came off

41:49.827 --> 41:52.137
because the other belt
wasn't super old.

41:52.137 --> 41:54.172
So maybe something else
is the issue.

41:54.172 --> 41:55.620
Let's go take a look at it.

41:55.620 --> 41:56.896
Let's do it.

42:00.482 --> 42:04.000
So this belt here
drives the shaker,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.172
bounces up and down
on these springs.

42:06.172 --> 42:08.655
So without that,
we can't wash rock.

42:08.655 --> 42:10.655
I think that's where
it got cut right there.

42:10.655 --> 42:12.965
Oh, we might be able to
turn sideways here.

42:16.172 --> 42:17.758
Whoa! Jeez! There you go.

42:19.413 --> 42:21.241
Okay.
I'll see it.

42:24.413 --> 42:25.724
Get it.

42:25.724 --> 42:28.310
- One more.
- Get it, right there.

42:30.344 --> 42:32.551
So you're saying
it's running up
against this lip.

42:32.551 --> 42:34.896
And it's feeling
that crown in it?

42:34.896 --> 42:36.379
Was there any pipe?

42:36.379 --> 42:38.655
There's a quarter-inch
between this end

42:38.655 --> 42:40.172
and this end.

42:40.172 --> 42:42.137
- So like...
- Oh, yeah.

42:42.137 --> 42:44.413
Oh, that doesn't...
It looks like that bearing
is bad on that side.

42:44.413 --> 42:45.896
It's seized up. Yeah.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.275
Yeah.
That doesn't look so good.

42:47.275 --> 42:48.586
It's just
right in the shaft.

42:48.586 --> 42:50.896
That's making this belt
want to walk up on this lip,

42:50.896 --> 42:52.793
which is making
this belt roll off.

42:52.793 --> 42:54.827
And so, getting that
aligned straight

42:54.827 --> 42:56.137
where there's no play,
allows it

42:56.137 --> 42:58.344
to just keep it
perfectly aligned.

42:58.344 --> 43:00.344
Can you
just take a bungee
and just pull it over?

43:00.344 --> 43:03.172
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll throw a bungee
on it and see.

43:03.172 --> 43:04.586
See what we can come up
with here.

43:06.413 --> 43:09.206
<i>The pulley wheel
on the Shaker deck's
drive belt</i>

43:09.206 --> 43:11.172
<i>tensioner has come loose,</i>

43:11.172 --> 43:14.517
<i>making the belt ride up
onto its outer lip,</i>

43:14.517 --> 43:17.206
<i>causing friction
and the belt to tear.</i>

43:19.551 --> 43:23.586
<i>Mark's bush fix,
wrap bungees around
the belt tensioner arm</i>

43:23.586 --> 43:26.586
<i>to pull it in, forcing
the pulley into alignment,</i>

43:27.793 --> 43:30.862
<i>preventing any further friction
or belt tears.</i>

43:33.862 --> 43:36.413
So our tensioner is just
kind of bouncing in there

43:36.413 --> 43:38.758
and it's flopping around.

43:38.758 --> 43:42.241
So this just adds
a little more tension
to it, to stabilize it.

43:44.965 --> 43:46.931
We'll put one more
on like this.
And we're good.

43:48.172 --> 43:50.724
So we grew up on a homestead
without hardware stores,

43:50.724 --> 43:53.758
so pretty much
whatever you could find
or make,

43:53.758 --> 43:55.724
is what you'd use
to fix things.

43:57.482 --> 43:58.931
So you like learn
to make things out of...

44:00.275 --> 44:02.275
like bubble gum
and mushrooms.

44:03.862 --> 44:04.931
Where you at, Jarred?

44:04.931 --> 44:06.448
You want to fire
this up again?

44:15.344 --> 44:16.413
Let's get to sluicing.

44:19.413 --> 44:21.586
<i>After four hours
shut down.</i>

44:21.586 --> 44:25.724
<i>Mark's quick thinking
has the wash plant
back on the gold.</i>

44:25.724 --> 44:27.655
Mark is extremely resourceful.

44:27.655 --> 44:31.000
Wasn't too much downtime
and we're back in action.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.827
<i>Island's nice
and organized</i>

44:32.827 --> 44:35.275
<i>and Mark's a good foreman.</i>

44:35.275 --> 44:38.275
<i>He's motivated, so I think
we're gonna get along.</i>

44:40.275 --> 44:42.034
<i>With the plant up
and running,</i>

44:42.034 --> 44:43.931
<i>Parker's one step closer</i>

44:43.931 --> 44:46.758
<i>to weighing
his first Alaskan gold.</i>

44:48.034 --> 44:49.275
I'm not gonna get too excited

44:49.275 --> 44:52.068
until we see if we're making
money or just losing more.

45:06.413 --> 45:07.482
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

45:11.758 --> 45:13.448
So I have to be
very careful here right now

45:13.448 --> 45:14.862
because I'm very wide.

45:14.862 --> 45:16.931
No one likes getting hit
in the face

45:16.931 --> 45:18.551
with a long black thing.

45:18.551 --> 45:19.965
<i>At Paradise Hill,</i>

45:19.965 --> 45:23.275
<i>with pay running out
from the Blue and Cold cuts.</i>

45:23.275 --> 45:26.965
<i>It's all hands on deck
to drain the Eighty Pup cut.</i>

45:26.965 --> 45:29.379
Let's fire this [bleep] up.

45:29.379 --> 45:32.965
<i>While Mike and Kevin build
a thousand foot mega pipe.</i>

45:35.655 --> 45:38.931
<i>Tony's counting
on his brand new
belly scrapers</i>

45:38.931 --> 45:41.275
<i>to speed up
the build of the dike.</i>

45:41.275 --> 45:45.310
<i>That will also serve
as a road around the new pond.</i>

45:51.827 --> 45:53.241
They're under a lot
of time pressure

45:53.241 --> 45:57.965
because we want to get
the settling pond done
as soon as we can.

45:59.034 --> 46:02.793
Just dump here
on this side road
off the dike.

46:04.068 --> 46:06.724
<i>Cousin Mike,
lays gravel for the dike,</i>

46:06.724 --> 46:09.275
<i>building it up inch by inch.</i>

46:09.275 --> 46:12.379
<i>I need to make
some sharp turns here.</i>

46:12.379 --> 46:14.689
It's not easy. It's long.

46:14.689 --> 46:17.862
And when you make a turn
in the spot like this,

46:17.862 --> 46:20.620
it will take
the inside of the turn.

46:20.620 --> 46:25.068
So, yeah, it's easy
to flip this thing.

46:51.482 --> 46:52.827
Sorry

47:06.172 --> 47:07.724
<i>On Paradise Hill.</i>

47:07.724 --> 47:09.000
Sorry

47:11.000 --> 47:12.586
<i>Cousin Mike
has ditched</i>

47:12.586 --> 47:16.655
<i>one of Tony's
$350,000 belly scrapers.</i>

47:31.689 --> 47:33.344
They are long.

47:33.344 --> 47:35.655
It's a sharp turn
and, yeah, there she goes.

47:39.655 --> 47:41.000
<i>Tony, are you there?</i>

47:48.413 --> 47:50.241
<i>Yeah,
I'll be over there
in a minute.</i>

47:53.034 --> 47:56.896
<i>To haul out the
50-tonne truck and scraper.</i>

47:56.896 --> 48:01.689
<i>Mike brings
in a 414-horsepower
260 loader.</i>

48:11.793 --> 48:13.172
Yeah.

49:48.310 --> 49:49.931
<i>The thousand foot mega pipe</i>

49:49.931 --> 49:53.275
<i>is made of high density polyethylene,</i>

49:53.275 --> 49:57.275
<i>capable of carrying
2,000 gallons of water
a minute.</i>

50:22.793 --> 50:24.551
You guys got water
coming out over of there?

50:37.586 --> 50:39.034
<i>I can just imagine
what it looks like.</i>

50:45.586 --> 50:48.034
<i>With the Eighty Pup
finally draining.</i>

50:49.620 --> 50:53.448
<i>Tony is closer
to its gold rich
white channel pay</i>

50:53.448 --> 50:56.206
<i>and his 5,000-ounce gold.</i>

50:56.206 --> 50:57.448
Oh, we're just
on time.

50:57.448 --> 50:58.965
Yeah.

51:03.379 --> 51:04.862
Sounds good.

51:26.103 --> 51:27.896
<i>At California Creek,</i>

51:27.896 --> 51:30.310
<i>combat veteran
Stefan Generally</i>

51:30.310 --> 51:33.655
<i>is on his fifth consecutive
day in the excavator,</i>

51:33.655 --> 51:36.724
<i>slowly feeding pay
to Sergeant Sluice.</i>

51:36.724 --> 51:38.551
I used to say
it is what it is,

51:38.551 --> 51:40.137
but I'm kind of too slow.

51:40.137 --> 51:44.344
And you got to [bleep] kind of
concentrate and concentrate
and concentrate.

51:44.344 --> 51:46.827
You can't
let your attention
wander for a bit.

51:51.241 --> 51:52.379
Hey, there's Fred.

51:54.793 --> 51:56.413
Right now
we're having a big problem,

51:56.413 --> 51:58.241
especially with Stefan
being kind of rusty.

52:00.344 --> 52:02.827
<i>To help Stefan
move dirt faster,</i>

52:02.827 --> 52:04.103
<i>Fred's hatched a plan.</i>

52:07.413 --> 52:08.586
<i>We need a hopper feeder.</i>

52:09.793 --> 52:11.758
With a new hopper feeder
in the mix,

52:11.758 --> 52:15.137
we'll be able to feed
consistently up our yardage,
get more gold.

52:18.896 --> 52:20.482
This thing has been here.

52:20.482 --> 52:23.172
Brandon's had...
this hopper feeder here
all last season.

52:23.172 --> 52:25.103
- It looks like
- Well, yeah.

52:25.103 --> 52:29.448
It's older, but I'm wondering
if we can talk to him
about snagging this.

52:30.620 --> 52:32.655
<i>The Clayton's
old hopper feeder</i>

52:32.655 --> 52:35.758
<i>has been lying unused
for over a year.</i>

52:38.413 --> 52:41.275
We could feed the plant
a lot faster, a lot smoother,

52:41.275 --> 52:43.172
has grizzly bars on the top,

52:43.172 --> 52:45.137
and then it slides
right up into our wash plant,

52:45.137 --> 52:46.758
feeds it consistently
all day long.

52:48.379 --> 52:51.827
<i>The hopper feeders,
grizzly bars prevent blockages</i>

52:51.827 --> 52:54.862
<i>by screening out rocks
bigger than ten inches.</i>

52:56.586 --> 53:02.275
<i>Allowing paydirt to funnel
faster through the feeder
onto a conveyor belt.</i>

53:02.275 --> 53:05.310
<i>Which delivers it evenly
to the wash plant,</i>

53:05.310 --> 53:10.172
<i>maximizing yardage
with a constant supply
of boulder-free pay.</i>

53:13.413 --> 53:14.758
It's in relatively good shape.

53:15.827 --> 53:17.206
As long as the engine works.

53:17.206 --> 53:20.137
So, I think we're gonna
have to talk to Brandon.

53:29.310 --> 53:30.655
You got a visitor.

53:30.655 --> 53:32.517
- I have a visitor?
- How's it going?

53:32.517 --> 53:33.896
Pretty tough at the moment.

53:33.896 --> 53:36.000
Our dozer blew a coolant line.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.068
How about this, though?

53:37.068 --> 53:38.896
I've been looking
for a hopper feeder.

53:38.896 --> 53:40.310
I can't find
in town.

53:40.310 --> 53:42.827
And there's been one
sitting in the yard
for about a year now.

53:42.827 --> 53:45.103
What about,
you let us use it?

53:45.103 --> 53:46.827
So...

53:46.827 --> 53:47.965
I don't know.

53:50.586 --> 53:52.551
Just sitting there.

53:52.551 --> 53:54.896
If JB has a coolant line
the size of my pinky.

53:54.896 --> 53:56.482
- Pinky size hose line.
- Yeah.

53:56.482 --> 53:57.586
I think we can do that.

53:57.586 --> 53:59.000
Okay.
I got no use for it.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.620
So if you guys want to put her
to work, sure, why not?

54:01.620 --> 54:02.689
- All right.
- Yeah.

54:02.689 --> 54:03.827
Good to hear.

54:05.103 --> 54:06.413
<i>I've just made a deal
with Brandon.</i>

54:06.413 --> 54:08.137
<i>He's got a hopper feeder
over here</i>

54:08.137 --> 54:10.482
<i>that he hasn't been using
for quite some time.</i>

54:10.482 --> 54:12.241
<i>It's gonna give us
a lot more consistent feed,</i>

54:12.241 --> 54:14.758
<i>a lot more yardage
to that plant for me.</i>

54:14.758 --> 54:16.344
<i>I feel like I've gotten
a good deal out of this.</i>

54:26.827 --> 54:27.965
Set her down.

54:32.482 --> 54:33.758
Come on down.

54:37.103 --> 54:42.206
<i>Fred's plan
comes with one big drawback,
more downtime.</i>

54:42.206 --> 54:44.241
<i>So the crew work quickly</i>

54:44.241 --> 54:45.827
<i>to get the feeder
into position.</i>

54:48.862 --> 54:49.965
Ooh.

54:52.689 --> 54:54.758
This is a little bit sketch, man.

54:54.758 --> 54:57.241
Driving backwards
down this frickin' hill.

55:01.896 --> 55:04.482
This is gonna be a slow trip.

55:08.931 --> 55:10.827
We're on a ticking time bomb
right now.

55:10.827 --> 55:13.241
There's no gold going
through a starting sluice.

55:13.241 --> 55:15.103
It's not a productive
mine site right now,

55:15.103 --> 55:17.206
so I need this
to get finished.

55:17.206 --> 55:18.310
Like yesterday.

55:33.379 --> 55:36.206
<i>To set up
the five-tonne feeder,</i>

55:36.206 --> 55:41.586
<i>Buzz and Fred must drag it
up a 45-degree incline
to the top of the pad.</i>

55:45.310 --> 55:46.586
I'm gonna be in the 250,

55:46.586 --> 55:48.896
which right now
is sitting very precariously

55:48.896 --> 55:50.241
on the edge of our berm.

55:50.241 --> 55:53.344
I'm gonna pull as Buzz pushes

55:53.344 --> 55:56.517
and we're gonna try and guide
the hopper feeder up here.

56:01.172 --> 56:03.172
We're really careful
we don't pull this thing
too far forward,

56:03.172 --> 56:06.068
fall off the pad
or worse than to one of us.

56:10.827 --> 56:12.482
Oh, he's pushing fast
as I'm pulling.

56:14.034 --> 56:15.482
So we got to pull
at the same time.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.137
I'd say right now
I'm pretty much
at my max on stress.

56:38.137 --> 56:40.379
I don't like doing
like this.

56:49.482 --> 56:51.000
Oh, I don't like this.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.793
I don't like this.
I don't like this.

57:04.103 --> 57:07.275
Oh, I don't like this.
I don't like this.
I don't like this.

57:14.896 --> 57:17.137
Looks like
he might have broke the tank.

57:17.137 --> 57:19.172
<i>At California Creek,</i>

57:19.172 --> 57:21.344
<i>five tons of hopper feeder</i>

57:21.344 --> 57:23.758
<i>balances precariously
on the pad.</i>

57:28.000 --> 57:30.275
Push that thing out
towards me.

57:30.275 --> 57:32.827
You're gotta get
that belt centered
on that hopper right.

57:42.482 --> 57:44.551
That looks frickin'
beautiful right there.

57:44.551 --> 57:47.448
That's...
I'm about to throw up,
so I'm really...

57:49.517 --> 57:51.862
<i>Moving the hopper feeder into place</i>

57:51.862 --> 57:56.000
<i>has cost Fred
a full day sluicing.</i>

57:56.000 --> 57:57.965
It's okay. We're where we need
to be right now.

57:57.965 --> 57:59.448
We're about
to fire up the plant.

57:59.448 --> 58:01.034
First time with a feeder
on it,

58:01.034 --> 58:03.344
which for us
is a really big deal.

58:03.344 --> 58:05.862
So, as pissed off
and exhausted
as I am right now,

58:05.862 --> 58:07.965
I'm actually super excited
to see this.

58:07.965 --> 58:09.965
Go ahead, Stefan.
Power it up.

58:19.137 --> 58:20.344
All right, Fred.
Hit the water.

58:25.137 --> 58:26.827
Come on, baby.

58:49.758 --> 58:51.862
Hey, Stefan.
It's feeding really well?

58:52.965 --> 58:55.172
Squared in the sluice,
in like, 15 seconds.

58:56.793 --> 58:59.172
110%. It's working.

58:59.172 --> 59:02.896
All that hard work
we put in is gonna help us
get more gold.

59:02.896 --> 59:04.310
[bleep] Yeah.

59:07.448 --> 59:10.620
This is the first time
this plant is running

59:10.620 --> 59:14.758
at this speed with this
capacity efficiency.

59:14.758 --> 59:17.310
What do you think
the yardage is we're putting
through it is right now,

59:17.310 --> 59:18.448
because that's [bleep] going?

59:23.206 --> 59:25.103
- Oh.
- What the hell?

59:25.103 --> 59:27.896
Turn the power off, Chris.

59:27.896 --> 59:29.034
Power off.

59:41.482 --> 59:42.965
- Cooked the motor.
- Huh?

59:42.965 --> 59:44.689
Motor cooked.

59:44.689 --> 59:45.862
The motor?

59:47.310 --> 59:50.620
- Motor is done.
- What the

59:52.137 --> 59:53.310
nothing.

59:58.482 --> 1:00:00.413
- You can smell it.
- Oh, I smell that.

1:00:02.965 --> 1:00:04.551
Plus,
there's smoke in it.

1:00:04.551 --> 1:00:06.172
- So it's [bleep] fried?
- Yeah.

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:10.241
It's not like we're freaking
working it hard.

1:00:10.241 --> 1:00:11.448
No.

1:00:11.448 --> 1:00:14.137
<i>After only 15 minutes
of running,</i>

1:00:14.137 --> 1:00:16.034
<i>Fred's plan to run more pay</i>

1:00:16.034 --> 1:00:18.655
<i>with the hopper feeder
is dead,</i>

1:00:18.655 --> 1:00:21.413
<i>and his dream
of a 500-ounce season</i>

1:00:21.413 --> 1:00:22.931
<i>is further away than ever.</i>

1:00:46.586 --> 1:00:48.310
Wash plant's been running
for a while now,

1:00:48.310 --> 1:00:50.896
so I've come down because
we're about to pull off
those masks,

1:00:50.896 --> 1:00:52.034
which is really exciting.

1:00:52.034 --> 1:00:54.827
It's definitely not something
I'm familiar with.

1:00:54.827 --> 1:00:57.379
So Parker is gonna give you
a good rundown
of how it'll work,

1:00:57.379 --> 1:00:59.931
because when he leaves,
it could be me
or Mark doing it.

1:01:02.965 --> 1:01:04.586
<i>Parker Schnabel's crew</i>

1:01:04.586 --> 1:01:10.758
<i>has churned through
nearly 1,500 yards
of old timer drift tailings.</i>

1:01:10.758 --> 1:01:12.103
You want to go
grab that shovel

1:01:12.103 --> 1:01:13.620
and bring some buckets
up here.

1:01:13.620 --> 1:01:15.379
- Start shoveling
the sod.
- Hmm-mm.

1:01:17.689 --> 1:01:19.137
I'm seeing
lots of color.

1:01:19.137 --> 1:01:21.068
- Yeah,
there's some gold in it.
- Yeah.

1:01:22.862 --> 1:01:24.344
I'll just get these mats
out of the the way

1:01:24.344 --> 1:01:25.793
if you want to like clean
that edge up

1:01:25.793 --> 1:01:27.896
and that front edge
and get all mats,

1:01:27.896 --> 1:01:29.379
have to be right down
on the steel.

1:01:29.379 --> 1:01:32.172
So every other, every rock
in there has to come out.

1:01:32.172 --> 1:01:33.517
Get the bucket brigade going.

1:01:38.172 --> 1:01:39.862
No wonder Dumont's back's...

1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:47.172
<i>After processing
the gold,</i>

1:01:49.551 --> 1:01:51.172
<i>Parker brings
the team together</i>

1:01:51.172 --> 1:01:53.344
<i>for the first
Alaska Gold Weigh.</i>

1:01:54.620 --> 1:01:55.689
How's it going, guys?

1:01:55.689 --> 1:01:57.655
I'm good.
How about you, Parker?

1:01:57.655 --> 1:01:59.827
Oh, yeah.
We got a bucket of beers.

1:01:59.827 --> 1:02:02.034
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

1:02:02.034 --> 1:02:04.137
This is exciting.
Our first gold weigh.

1:02:04.137 --> 1:02:06.103
And it's not much.
Don't get crazy excited.

1:02:06.103 --> 1:02:07.931
But this was 14 hours
of running.

1:02:09.344 --> 1:02:10.448
Nice looking gold.

1:02:10.448 --> 1:02:11.655
Yeah, it is.

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.931
I'm a bit nervous.

1:02:14.931 --> 1:02:17.689
<i>To hit
his 1,000 ounce goal.</i>

1:02:17.689 --> 1:02:19.793
<i>Parker's looking
for the drift tailings</i>

1:02:19.793 --> 1:02:24.310
<i>to deliver an ounce of gold
per hour runtime.</i>

1:02:24.310 --> 1:02:25.724
So we're gonna have
to weigh in grams

1:02:25.724 --> 1:02:28.793
because the scale
only does normal ounces,

1:02:28.793 --> 1:02:30.827
not troy ounces
and grams.

1:02:30.827 --> 1:02:33.689
So we're gonna have
to divide this by 31.1.

1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.310
<i>Parker needs
435 grams</i>

1:02:38.310 --> 1:02:40.482
<i>in order to hit 14 ounces.</i>

1:02:42.965 --> 1:02:45.310
- Tyler, do you want
to read it out?
- Yes, please.

1:02:45.310 --> 1:02:51.689
50, 80, a 100, 150,

1:02:51.689 --> 1:02:54.724
200, 300...

1:02:56.206 --> 1:02:57.620
430.

1:02:57.620 --> 1:02:59.379
430 divided by what?

1:02:59.379 --> 1:03:01.310
31.1.

1:03:01.310 --> 1:03:03.965
13.82 ounces.

1:03:03.965 --> 1:03:08.448
Worth over $23,000.

1:03:08.448 --> 1:03:09.965
Just shy
of an ounce an hour.

1:03:09.965 --> 1:03:11.724
- There you go.
- That ain't too bad.

1:03:11.724 --> 1:03:14.000
- No.
- So, an ounce an hour?
Are you happy with that?

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.758
- Yeah, that's what
I was hoping to be doing.
- Yeah.

1:03:15.758 --> 1:03:18.068
Ounce an hour.
Now it's just a matter

1:03:18.068 --> 1:03:19.379
of how many hours can we run?

1:03:19.379 --> 1:03:20.620
- Yeah.
- Right?

1:03:20.620 --> 1:03:22.586
I finally feel like
we're over the hill
a little bit.

1:03:22.586 --> 1:03:23.896
We're, like, on a roll.

1:03:23.896 --> 1:03:25.862
So maybe we'll keep
this going for a little while.

1:03:25.862 --> 1:03:27.379
I hope so.

1:03:27.379 --> 1:03:28.551
Cheers, guys.

1:03:28.551 --> 1:03:30.793
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:03:30.793 --> 1:03:33.448
We finally know that
we're finding gold,
which is amazing.

1:03:33.448 --> 1:03:35.379
A huge weight off
my shoulders.

1:03:35.379 --> 1:03:36.827
<i>It's all coming together</i>

1:03:36.827 --> 1:03:39.241
<i>and seeing the gold there
today just makes it
all worth it.</i>

1:03:39.241 --> 1:03:41.413
<i>Now we can just keep
moving forward.</i>

1:03:41.413 --> 1:03:42.965
This is a big one.

1:03:42.965 --> 1:03:47.827
This is the first time
that we've found gold
back in Alaska in a decade.

1:03:47.827 --> 1:03:49.413
And that's really cool.

1:03:49.413 --> 1:03:51.034
It's nice to finally
be on some ground

1:03:51.034 --> 1:03:53.758
and be finding some gold
and have a good crew.

1:03:53.758 --> 1:03:54.931
<i>A lot's gone into this</i>

1:03:54.931 --> 1:03:56.896
<i>and it's really cool
to see it working out</i>

1:03:56.896 --> 1:03:59.448
and that's hopefully a sign
of what's to come.

1:04:00.827 --> 1:04:04.000
<i>It's a promising
start in Alaska,</i>

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.068
<i>but Parker has more business
to attend to.</i>

1:04:07.068 --> 1:04:09.000
I've got to get back
over to the Yukon.

1:04:13.517 --> 1:04:14.827
<i>Across the border.</i>

1:04:14.827 --> 1:04:17.137
<i>He's counting
on his Yukon crew</i>

1:04:17.137 --> 1:04:21.275
<i>to bring in the gold
from the massive
90-acre airstrip.</i>

1:04:24.172 --> 1:04:25.344
<i>This season has definitely</i>

1:04:25.344 --> 1:04:26.965
<i>been the toughest year
we've ever had.</i>

1:04:26.965 --> 1:04:30.103
I totally understand
Parker's desire
to get to Alaska,

1:04:30.103 --> 1:04:32.482
and he needs to be thinking
about the future
of the company.

1:04:32.482 --> 1:04:34.241
But it's my job to think
about the dirt

1:04:34.241 --> 1:04:36.344
we have to move
right here, right now,

1:04:36.344 --> 1:04:38.448
<i>especially as Parker's
due back at the end
of the week.</i>

1:04:57.620 --> 1:04:58.827
<i>All right, let's do it.</i>

1:05:03.206 --> 1:05:06.310
<i>Forced to abandon
the hopper feeder,</i>

1:05:06.310 --> 1:05:08.344
<i>the pressure is back on Stefan</i>

1:05:08.344 --> 1:05:10.517
<i>to keep the wash plant
fed with pay.</i>

1:05:14.379 --> 1:05:16.482
Another long-ass day
of feeding this plant.

1:05:18.620 --> 1:05:20.862
I swear,
I think doing this job is like

1:05:20.862 --> 1:05:23.689
being a mindless automaton.

1:05:23.689 --> 1:05:25.448
I mean, this...

1:05:25.448 --> 1:05:27.310
Sit here and scoop.

1:05:27.310 --> 1:05:29.620
Scoop and feed.
Scoop and feed.

1:05:29.620 --> 1:05:32.517
Got to pay attention.
You don't wanna drop
into it.

1:05:32.517 --> 1:05:33.689
I got to piss,

1:05:33.689 --> 1:05:35.758
step on the tread and piss.

1:05:35.758 --> 1:05:37.586
You got to eat,
you better have it with you.

1:05:41.275 --> 1:05:43.724
When he told me he needed help
and it was going to be hard,

1:05:45.931 --> 1:05:49.793
I guess
I should have took him
a little more figuratively

1:05:49.793 --> 1:05:51.620
because this is ridiculous.

1:06:08.344 --> 1:06:11.137
Damn it.

1:06:15.241 --> 1:06:17.620
I just dropped a huge rock
in the hopper.

1:06:28.965 --> 1:06:32.000
Hey, Fred! Fred!

1:06:33.655 --> 1:06:35.241
Oh, no.

1:06:56.241 --> 1:06:59.310
All right.
I'm... I'm, kind of
frazzled right now.

1:06:59.310 --> 1:07:02.034
I missed this rock
and it's a huge rock,

1:07:02.034 --> 1:07:04.310
and we had to shut it down,

1:07:04.310 --> 1:07:06.689
which is the last thing
Fred wants.

1:07:06.689 --> 1:07:08.034
So...

1:07:11.103 --> 1:07:12.551
I'm not really feeling
this [bleep].

1:07:12.551 --> 1:07:14.379
I'm telling you.

1:07:14.379 --> 1:07:16.137
There's a [bleep] big rock in.

1:07:17.931 --> 1:07:19.206
Yeah.

1:07:19.206 --> 1:07:21.482
Dude, I didn't even
see it, man.

1:07:21.482 --> 1:07:22.931
It was covered up
with mud,

1:07:22.931 --> 1:07:25.517
and at the last minute,
I saw it slip down.

1:07:25.517 --> 1:07:27.724
But at that point,
it was already, like,
past the teeth.

1:07:29.655 --> 1:07:31.000
I must--

1:07:32.310 --> 1:07:33.827
I mean, I can't say it
any simpler,

1:07:33.827 --> 1:07:35.344
but this
just ain't me, man.

1:07:35.344 --> 1:07:37.034
- Yeah.
- This is...

1:07:37.034 --> 1:07:39.517
I mean, I came out here
expecting to [bleep],
you know,

1:07:39.517 --> 1:07:41.862
work a little bit,
have fun, enjoy it.

1:07:41.862 --> 1:07:43.655
This is [bleep] all work, man.

1:07:43.655 --> 1:07:45.275
- Yeah.
- How the [bleep] do you do it?

1:07:46.862 --> 1:07:49.000
It's just me, right?

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.655
- Damn, dude.
- Well, I...

1:07:52.172 --> 1:07:53.827
I mean,
my hat's off to you.

1:07:53.827 --> 1:07:55.965
I admire
the [bleep] out of you.

1:07:55.965 --> 1:07:59.827
All right. Let's grab
a chain and get this
rock out of there.

1:07:59.827 --> 1:08:02.000
All right.
I'll just jump in the hole.

1:08:11.137 --> 1:08:14.517
This rock is just a
frickin' pain in the ass.

1:08:15.965 --> 1:08:17.172
We just got to shut down

1:08:17.172 --> 1:08:18.724
for something
that really sucks.

1:08:29.793 --> 1:08:31.517
Bro.

1:08:31.517 --> 1:08:33.034
How's it going, dude?

1:08:33.034 --> 1:08:34.724
- Not good.
- What's up?

1:08:37.413 --> 1:08:38.896
Man.

1:08:38.896 --> 1:08:41.137
I love you, and I got
to keep it 100 with you.

1:08:41.137 --> 1:08:44.000
But this [bleep] ain't for me.

1:08:46.448 --> 1:08:47.689
You told me it was hard,

1:08:47.689 --> 1:08:49.206
and you even told me
12-hour shifts.

1:08:49.206 --> 1:08:50.310
But I didn't take it to heart.

1:08:50.310 --> 1:08:51.551
I should have.

1:08:51.551 --> 1:08:53.517
I can't sit in that
damn machine for 12 hours.

1:08:53.517 --> 1:08:55.965
It kills me.

1:08:55.965 --> 1:08:57.310
I just can't.

1:08:59.206 --> 1:09:02.758
I really, really [bleep] hate
disappointing you like this.

1:09:02.758 --> 1:09:04.000
But I can't do this, man.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.655
- I got to [bleep] go.
- Really?

1:09:12.551 --> 1:09:15.827
Man, you know I love you.

1:09:15.827 --> 1:09:17.310
So it is what it is.

1:09:17.310 --> 1:09:19.862
And I appreciate
you sticking your arm out

1:09:19.862 --> 1:09:21.931
to come and help me
in the first place.

1:09:21.931 --> 1:09:23.103
I'll figure it out.

1:09:23.103 --> 1:09:24.724
I don't want you to feel like
you've come here

1:09:24.724 --> 1:09:25.965
and let me down
because you didn't.

1:09:25.965 --> 1:09:27.137
There's no bad blood
between us.

1:09:27.137 --> 1:09:28.758
- Obviously.
- I don't expect there to be.

1:09:28.758 --> 1:09:30.310
I've been to combat
with you,

1:09:30.310 --> 1:09:32.551
I'm not going to get
pissed off at you over
something stupid like this.

1:09:32.551 --> 1:09:33.931
- But...
- I got you.

1:09:33.931 --> 1:09:36.137
It's not for everybody.

1:09:36.137 --> 1:09:37.965
You mean that.

1:09:41.620 --> 1:09:42.793
All right.

1:09:46.103 --> 1:09:47.655
Thanks for coming.

1:09:47.655 --> 1:09:48.896
Appreciate it.

1:10:01.482 --> 1:10:03.068
Honestly, right now,
I don't know how to react.

1:10:03.068 --> 1:10:05.379
I... I brought Stefan up here.

1:10:05.379 --> 1:10:08.482
He's one of my best friends
and he was really good
in Oregon.

1:10:08.482 --> 1:10:09.758
We had a good season together

1:10:09.758 --> 1:10:11.206
and he was willing
to come up here

1:10:11.206 --> 1:10:12.827
and help me out
on the drop of a hat.

1:10:14.724 --> 1:10:17.758
<i>I can't afford
to be the one to
this up for Fred.</i>

1:10:17.758 --> 1:10:20.551
<i>And if it means
I got to step out and go home,</i>

1:10:20.551 --> 1:10:22.000
<i>hey, so be it.</i>

1:10:24.448 --> 1:10:26.379
<i>Puts me in a very,
very sticky situation.</i>

1:10:27.965 --> 1:10:29.448
We're already down.

1:10:29.448 --> 1:10:30.793
We're already
behind our gold count.

1:10:30.793 --> 1:10:33.206
We're already struggling
as it is to keep
our equipment running.

1:10:33.206 --> 1:10:36.103
And now this.
And it's just one thing
after another.

1:10:36.103 --> 1:10:38.137
It's really demoralizing
to the whole team.

1:10:38.137 --> 1:10:39.724
I know that
they're not going to be happy.

1:10:43.137 --> 1:10:45.965
Honestly,
at this point, I'm lost
and I don't know what to do.

1:11:05.482 --> 1:11:06.862
- Good job.
- Hey.

1:11:06.862 --> 1:11:08.689
Hey.
It's always good to see

1:11:08.689 --> 1:11:09.896
Mama Shelly
cleaning some gold.

1:11:09.896 --> 1:11:12.482
Yeah. Yeah.
It was a small cleanup.

1:11:12.482 --> 1:11:13.896
Didn't take too long.

1:11:13.896 --> 1:11:15.862
<i>At Glacier Creek, Alaska,</i>

1:11:15.862 --> 1:11:18.172
<i>it's time to see
if Dave Turin's</i>

1:11:18.172 --> 1:11:21.655
<i>three test holes
hold enough gold
to convince Jason</i>

1:11:21.655 --> 1:11:23.620
<i>and Nathan to buy the mine.</i>

1:11:24.827 --> 1:11:27.241
Well, what do we got?
How's it looking?

1:11:27.241 --> 1:11:29.965
We got
your three test spots

1:11:31.275 --> 1:11:33.275
cleaned up, ready to go.

1:11:33.275 --> 1:11:36.862
You know, you guys are
the prospective claim owners.

1:11:36.862 --> 1:11:38.034
You're the buyers.

1:11:38.034 --> 1:11:39.448
What do you want
to see you think?

1:11:40.931 --> 1:11:45.034
I mean, close to 20 bucks
a yard might be feasible.

1:11:46.310 --> 1:11:48.620
<i>Last season,
Dave's Sunlight Cut</i>

1:11:48.620 --> 1:11:51.172
<i>produced $20 a yard.</i>

1:11:51.172 --> 1:11:54.724
<i>With 50 acres of mineable
ground up for sale,</i>

1:11:54.724 --> 1:11:58.137
<i>there's potentially
$10 million of gold</i>

1:11:58.137 --> 1:12:01.862
<i>making Dave's million-dollar
price tag a steal.</i>

1:12:10.310 --> 1:12:11.344
Shelly,
what do you got?

1:12:11.344 --> 1:12:13.241
Well,
number one is 1.9.

1:12:13.241 --> 1:12:14.551
All right, 1.9.

1:12:16.379 --> 1:12:17.965
That's 11 bucks a yard,
you guys.

1:12:21.344 --> 1:12:23.103
All right.
That's not very good.

1:12:23.103 --> 1:12:24.724
- No.
- All right.

1:12:24.724 --> 1:12:25.965
Number two.

1:12:32.379 --> 1:12:35.000
2.5 grams.

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.241
It's 15 bucks a yard.

1:12:37.620 --> 1:12:39.931
That's a little bit lower
than our average last year.

1:12:39.931 --> 1:12:41.068
- All right.
- Good.

1:12:41.068 --> 1:12:42.620
- All right.
- How about hole number three?

1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:46.068
All right.
Let's see three on here.
Here we go.

1:12:46.068 --> 1:12:48.758
It's got to be
our good one, Jason, right?

1:12:48.758 --> 1:12:50.206
I'm thinking so.

1:12:50.206 --> 1:12:51.620
It's a lot more,
I tell you that.

1:12:51.620 --> 1:12:53.482
3.6 grams.

1:12:53.482 --> 1:12:57.793
3.6, $20.80 a yard.

1:12:57.793 --> 1:13:00.172
- That's a lot better.
- That's a lot better.

1:13:00.172 --> 1:13:02.103
That you could
probably live with.

1:13:02.103 --> 1:13:04.206
Oh, yeah,
I can deal with that.

1:13:04.206 --> 1:13:06.379
All three of those averaged
together gives you

1:13:06.379 --> 1:13:08.827
a $15.60 a yard.

1:13:08.827 --> 1:13:10.275
And some of that's good.

1:13:10.275 --> 1:13:12.413
$20.80 a yard.

1:13:12.413 --> 1:13:13.724
What do you guys want to do?

1:13:14.896 --> 1:13:16.275
You know, Dave, I mean,

1:13:16.275 --> 1:13:17.689
I, I like seeing that
$20 a yard.

1:13:17.689 --> 1:13:18.862
I mean,
that's fricking awesome.

1:13:18.862 --> 1:13:20.206
And I like
seeing the other one,

1:13:20.206 --> 1:13:22.241
that's, you know,
the 15-something.

1:13:22.241 --> 1:13:25.586
But I really think
we should fire the Eagle up.

1:13:27.103 --> 1:13:29.379
Do you want to fire
the Eagle up to prospect?

1:13:29.379 --> 1:13:30.551
That's a big plant.

1:13:30.551 --> 1:13:32.275
Hey, you want
to sell the [bleep]?

1:13:32.275 --> 1:13:33.586
I do.

1:13:35.862 --> 1:13:37.586
<i>Still not convinced about</i>

1:13:37.586 --> 1:13:40.172
<i>buying Dave's
turnkey operation,</i>

1:13:40.172 --> 1:13:42.551
<i>Nathan wants
to run more ground</i>

1:13:42.551 --> 1:13:45.068
<i>and road test the Eagle,</i>

1:13:45.068 --> 1:13:49.206
<i>the 180-yard-an-hour plant
included in the deal.</i>

1:13:50.517 --> 1:13:51.793
That's pretty crazy.

1:13:51.793 --> 1:13:54.034
I'll tell you what,
Shelly and I will throw
in the fuel.

1:13:54.034 --> 1:13:55.620
Let's split
the gold three ways.

1:13:55.620 --> 1:13:57.034
We'll cover our costs.

1:13:57.034 --> 1:13:59.931
We walk out of here
with some gold in our pockets,
and we mine

1:13:59.931 --> 1:14:01.758
Team Turin one last time.

1:14:01.758 --> 1:14:03.586
Let's do it
before we buy this property.

1:14:03.586 --> 1:14:04.758
- You all good?
- Yep.

1:14:04.758 --> 1:14:06.034
- I love it.
- I love it. Shelly?

1:14:06.034 --> 1:14:07.137
- Yeah, I'm in.
- All right.

1:14:07.137 --> 1:14:09.172
- All in.
- One, two, three.

1:14:09.172 --> 1:14:10.586
All in.

1:14:10.586 --> 1:14:12.137
You are out
of your damn mind, Nate.

1:14:13.896 --> 1:14:15.896
You know, I know
it's a big ask for, you know,

1:14:15.896 --> 1:14:17.931
firing the Eagle up,
but, you know, why not?

1:14:17.931 --> 1:14:20.000
I mean, let's see
what the ground really has.

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.517
And the best part
is if we can do this
as a small operation

1:14:22.517 --> 1:14:24.551
and it's profitable,
then it's going to be awesome.

1:14:24.551 --> 1:14:26.344
I mean,
this could be my future.

1:14:26.344 --> 1:14:28.034
We're back at it again.

1:14:28.034 --> 1:14:30.689
We're digging,
we're throwing dirt,

1:14:30.689 --> 1:14:32.724
we're washing,
we're pulling gold.

1:14:32.724 --> 1:14:34.896
<i>Team Turin
is right back at it.</i>

1:14:34.896 --> 1:14:36.310
<i>I'm all for it.</i>

1:14:36.310 --> 1:14:38.586
Team Turin is back
and I love it.

1:14:38.586 --> 1:14:40.000
I'm excited.

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.344
Let's run some dirt.

1:14:50.379 --> 1:14:52.034
Yeah.
Are you ready to get stabbed?

1:14:52.034 --> 1:14:54.517
Are you ready?

1:15:04.068 --> 1:15:07.758
All right, Tony,
I do believe we are done.

1:15:10.068 --> 1:15:11.275
It looks like a belly scraper.

1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.310
<i>After a tough week
of shutdowns</i>

1:15:37.310 --> 1:15:41.103
<i>and losing Stefan,
Fred Lewis assembles his crew</i>

1:15:41.103 --> 1:15:44.517
<i>for the third Freedom
Cut gold weigh.</i>

1:15:44.517 --> 1:15:45.724
Guys, I understand Stefan

1:15:45.724 --> 1:15:47.862
coming and leaving
really is a testament

1:15:47.862 --> 1:15:50.862
to you guys' fortitude here,
how hard this lifestyle is

1:15:50.862 --> 1:15:52.896
and how hard we are working
our asses off up here.

1:15:52.896 --> 1:15:54.482
So I really appreciate
your hard work.

1:15:55.586 --> 1:15:56.758
Let's see
how much gold we got.

1:15:56.758 --> 1:15:58.482
All right, Christopher,
you gonna have the honors?

1:15:58.482 --> 1:16:00.068
Sure.

1:16:02.068 --> 1:16:03.448
Here we go.

1:16:05.448 --> 1:16:08.517
One, two, three...

1:16:08.517 --> 1:16:09.896
<i>With just weeks left</i>

1:16:09.896 --> 1:16:12.551
<i>to hit his 500-ounce goal,</i>

1:16:12.551 --> 1:16:14.965
<i>Fred needs over
50 ounces a week.</i>

1:16:16.310 --> 1:16:19.103
...eight, nine, ten,

1:16:19.103 --> 1:16:21.275
11, 12,

1:16:21.275 --> 1:16:25.931
13, 14, 15, 16, 17...

1:16:25.931 --> 1:16:31.724
Here we go.
...18, 19, 19.78.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:36.655
<i>Worth over $33,000.</i>

1:16:36.655 --> 1:16:39.206
<i>Their best gold weigh
of the season</i>

1:16:39.206 --> 1:16:42.517
<i>brings Fred's total
to 72 ounces.</i>

1:16:43.862 --> 1:16:45.689
Look, these numbers
are decent.

1:16:45.689 --> 1:16:48.137
But right now I'm looking
at the gold weighs,

1:16:48.137 --> 1:16:50.206
the amount of yardage our team
is able to put together

1:16:50.206 --> 1:16:52.551
and it's just not enough.

1:16:52.551 --> 1:16:54.413
You're not thinking
of partnering
with Brennan again?

1:16:54.413 --> 1:16:55.931
[bleep] no.
No partnerships.

1:16:55.931 --> 1:16:57.172
No. No partnership.

1:16:57.172 --> 1:16:58.379
I just want to beat him.

1:17:00.793 --> 1:17:01.896
All right, guys.

1:17:01.896 --> 1:17:03.586
You know, this gold
ain't going to find itself.

1:17:03.586 --> 1:17:05.034
Let's get back to work.

1:17:07.586 --> 1:17:09.862
<i>Honestly,
this week's kind of been
a kick in the pants.</i>

1:17:09.862 --> 1:17:11.000
<i>19 ounces.</i>

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:12.068
Not good.

1:17:12.068 --> 1:17:13.793
Pretty mediocre.

1:17:13.793 --> 1:17:16.551
But I can already tell
the rest of the season

1:17:16.551 --> 1:17:18.827
is just gonna go downhill.

1:17:18.827 --> 1:17:20.310
It's gonna be
just like last season

1:17:20.310 --> 1:17:22.103
where everyone
was just [bleep] miserable.

1:17:23.689 --> 1:17:25.620
You know, 19 ounces.
That's not horrible.

1:17:25.620 --> 1:17:27.758
It's something to be proud of.

1:17:27.758 --> 1:17:30.344
<i>But our goal is much higher.</i>

1:17:30.344 --> 1:17:32.482
500 could still happen.

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:34.137
Any more days we lose,

1:17:34.137 --> 1:17:35.448
it's just slipping away.

1:17:35.448 --> 1:17:37.827
And I got to really evaluate
where we're at right now
as a team

1:17:37.827 --> 1:17:39.206
and figure this [bleep] out.

1:17:57.068 --> 1:17:58.448
Hey.

1:17:58.448 --> 1:17:59.931
Hola.

1:17:59.931 --> 1:18:01.931
<i>With the flooded
80 Pup Cut</i>

1:18:01.931 --> 1:18:04.103
<i>draining into the new pond,</i>

1:18:04.103 --> 1:18:05.931
<i>the Beets gather to weigh</i>

1:18:05.931 --> 1:18:10.965
<i>a week's running 24/7
from the Blue Cut expansion.</i>

1:18:10.965 --> 1:18:14.551
So I hear cousin Mike
had some excitement
with the scraper.

1:18:24.655 --> 1:18:26.206
That's the most important
thing, isn't it?

1:18:26.206 --> 1:18:29.482
Anyways, that's all
being said and done.

1:18:29.482 --> 1:18:31.517
I think we should weigh
some gold.

1:18:31.517 --> 1:18:32.827
Will you count it
while I weigh them?

1:18:32.827 --> 1:18:34.172
Yeah, I'll count.

1:18:34.172 --> 1:18:36.000
Ten, 20...

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:39.551
<i>To stay on track
for his 5000-ounce goal,</i>

1:18:39.551 --> 1:18:43.000
<i>Tony needs
at least 350 ounces a week.</i>

1:18:45.551 --> 1:18:48.206
210, 30, 40.

1:18:48.206 --> 1:18:50.793
300. 320.

1:18:50.793 --> 1:18:53.379
350, 400.

1:18:53.379 --> 1:18:54.482
430.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.172
450.36.

1:19:00.758 --> 1:19:04.931
<i>Worth $766,000.</i>

1:19:04.931 --> 1:19:06.310
That's not bad.

1:19:08.655 --> 1:19:10.724
<i>Bringing Tony's season total</i>

1:19:10.724 --> 1:19:15.000
<i>so far to 2,547 ounces</i>

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.965
<i>worth over $4.4 million.</i>

1:19:34.896 --> 1:19:36.758
But can I pay some bills first

1:19:36.758 --> 1:19:38.172
from the
you bought before?

1:19:42.896 --> 1:19:44.517
Okay, let's roll out.

1:19:44.517 --> 1:19:46.275
See you guys later.

1:19:46.275 --> 1:19:48.379
Well, it was
a pretty good gold weigh.

1:19:48.379 --> 1:19:50.586
Not a bad [bleep] number
to see on the scale.

1:19:50.586 --> 1:19:52.586
Hopefully, we got
a couple more like that.

1:20:05.517 --> 1:20:06.620
So that's pretty good.

1:20:13.724 --> 1:20:15.448
Sounds like a plan.

1:20:15.448 --> 1:20:16.551
See you later.

1:20:31.137 --> 1:20:32.206
- Hi.
- Hey, youngster.

1:20:32.206 --> 1:20:33.344
Do you want to come in?

1:20:33.344 --> 1:20:34.758
Oh, what's up,
Doze man?

1:20:34.758 --> 1:20:36.413
- Welcome home.
- Hey, young man.

1:20:36.413 --> 1:20:37.517
How was Alaska?

1:20:37.517 --> 1:20:38.655
It's going good.

1:20:38.655 --> 1:20:40.758
How's the rental wash plant
been working there?

1:20:40.758 --> 1:20:43.000
- Has it been steady? Yeah.
- It's a nice plant.

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.862
Well, we ran
some of the drift tailings.

1:20:44.862 --> 1:20:45.965
Oh, yeah?

1:20:45.965 --> 1:20:47.448
And they went
an ounce an hour.

1:20:47.448 --> 1:20:49.482
Like, it's nice-looking stuff.

1:20:49.482 --> 1:20:51.068
And if it keeps
going an ounce an hour,

1:20:51.068 --> 1:20:53.413
then like, we'll be fine.

1:20:53.413 --> 1:20:54.965
How are you doing

1:20:54.965 --> 1:20:57.275
running two operations
so adjacent?

1:20:57.275 --> 1:20:59.275
I miss you guys.
I miss this place.

1:20:59.275 --> 1:21:00.689
There's a good crew
over there.

1:21:00.689 --> 1:21:02.793
Like the crew is great,
but they're new to me.

1:21:02.793 --> 1:21:04.931
I might develop that
with them eventually,

1:21:04.931 --> 1:21:07.000
but it's not like us.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.862
That's the crew there.
That's family here.

1:21:08.862 --> 1:21:10.448
Yeah.

1:21:10.448 --> 1:21:12.413
What do you find yourself
doing in Alaska?

1:21:12.413 --> 1:21:13.793
Just like get this thing.

1:21:13.793 --> 1:21:16.310
I'm surprised it hasn't melted
a hole in my pocket.

1:21:16.310 --> 1:21:18.241
You get this thing out.

1:21:18.241 --> 1:21:19.793
There's a limit
somewhere on this thing.

1:21:19.793 --> 1:21:21.482
And I'm, like, determined
to find it.

1:21:22.758 --> 1:21:24.310
But it's expensive.

1:21:24.310 --> 1:21:26.275
We're just chugging
along over here.

1:21:26.275 --> 1:21:27.862
And thank you for that.

1:21:27.862 --> 1:21:30.068
I... I do appreciate you guys.

1:21:30.068 --> 1:21:31.758
I know there's a lot
that you're dealing with,

1:21:31.758 --> 1:21:33.896
but I appreciate
you guys keeping the wheels

1:21:33.896 --> 1:21:35.103
on the bus over here.

1:21:35.103 --> 1:21:36.655
Well, pretty cool, though,

1:21:36.655 --> 1:21:38.413
that we got
two operations rolling.

1:21:38.413 --> 1:21:40.758
So it's kind of like
exploration over there.

1:21:40.758 --> 1:21:42.137
I mean, hopefully,
it can be...

1:21:42.137 --> 1:21:43.448
That's what
I'm billing it to.

1:21:43.448 --> 1:21:44.965
Yeah.

1:21:44.965 --> 1:21:47.862
Hopefully, you know, it can be
the new part of this company

1:21:47.862 --> 1:21:49.241
because, man,
we need some dirt

1:21:49.241 --> 1:21:51.000
like, we are burning
through it.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.724
Yeah. Yeah, you guys are.

1:21:52.724 --> 1:21:54.724
And I think
we can help soften the pain

1:21:54.724 --> 1:21:56.344
of that credit card
a little bit.

1:21:56.344 --> 1:21:57.689
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1:21:57.689 --> 1:21:59.068
- You got some gold?
- Yeah.

1:21:59.068 --> 1:22:00.862
You ready, Sparky?

1:22:00.862 --> 1:22:02.551
This is Big Red...

1:22:02.551 --> 1:22:03.793
that we got.

1:22:03.793 --> 1:22:08.241
60, 90, 100, 150.

1:22:09.689 --> 1:22:11.448
Two--

1:22:11.448 --> 1:22:13.551
200.05.

1:22:13.551 --> 1:22:17.310
<i>Worth $340,000.</i>

1:22:17.310 --> 1:22:19.448
Yeah.
So Red's been doing good, right?

1:22:19.448 --> 1:22:20.862
It's been doing
its thing.

1:22:20.862 --> 1:22:23.862
Slucifer
is the same situation.

1:22:23.862 --> 1:22:25.068
Here we go.

1:22:27.310 --> 1:22:30.689
Ten, 30, 90, 100...

1:22:32.172 --> 1:22:33.241
150...

1:22:34.344 --> 1:22:35.517
200.

1:22:37.379 --> 1:22:39.689
257.25.

1:22:39.689 --> 1:22:43.724
<i>Worth over $430,000.</i>

1:22:43.724 --> 1:22:48.793
<i>A combined total
of over $770,000.</i>

1:22:48.793 --> 1:22:50.379
Good job.

1:22:50.379 --> 1:22:51.586
We're getting there.

1:22:51.586 --> 1:22:53.448
<i>Bringing Parker's season total</i>

1:22:53.448 --> 1:22:57.724
<i>to 4,788 ounces.</i>

1:22:57.724 --> 1:22:59.793
Now what you need to do
is find us some more dirt.

1:22:59.793 --> 1:23:01.931
- Yeah.
- So hopefully it's in Alaska.

1:23:01.931 --> 1:23:05.172
Well, thanks
for funding my hobbies, guys.

1:23:05.172 --> 1:23:06.379
You know,
it makes me feel better

1:23:06.379 --> 1:23:08.586
about blowing
a bunch of cash over there.

1:23:08.586 --> 1:23:14.413
It's so nice to be over there
and know how much pride

1:23:14.413 --> 1:23:17.172
you know, you put
in your work, and it shows.

1:23:17.172 --> 1:23:18.344
I really appreciate it.

1:23:20.172 --> 1:23:21.862
<i>A really good couple of weeks.</i>

1:23:21.862 --> 1:23:24.862
It's good to see the boys
here are getting rocks washed,

1:23:24.862 --> 1:23:26.620
<i>finding gold.</i>

1:23:26.620 --> 1:23:30.448
<i>I'm super proud of them
and super happy
with the crew here.</i>

1:23:30.448 --> 1:23:31.896
Yeah, that's good.
It's good to see that.

1:23:33.068 --> 1:23:35.068
Come on.

1:23:35.068 --> 1:23:36.517
Doze man.
