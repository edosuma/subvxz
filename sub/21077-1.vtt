18:32.217 --> 18:35.652
- Do I hear a slow jam?
- Who play this type of music at a riot?

18:35.654 --> 18:38.355
<i>[music]
[cheering]</i>

18:38.357 --> 18:40.690
Play "Neighborhood Number Three."

18:40.692 --> 18:44.294
Eat shit.
Play "Suburbs."

18:44.296 --> 18:46.830
Damn, white folks done
gentrified the riot.

18:46.832 --> 18:50.100
It reminds me of Burning Man,
but before it got all corporate.

18:50.102 --> 18:52.235
It look like we too late, my nigs.

18:52.237 --> 18:57.474
[gasps] I really don't like what's
happening to our neighborhood.

18:57.476 --> 18:59.109
Ugh, I'm over this place.

18:59.111 --> 19:01.711
Yeah, our work here is done.
[phone ringing]

19:01.713 --> 19:06.183
Hey, there's a new neighborhood
popping up, and it's real shitty.

19:06.185 --> 19:07.617
Sounds great. Let's go.

19:24.547 --> 19:27.715
- Aye, I'm cutting you off, Don Lemon.
- Come on, 'Trelly 'Trel.

19:27.717 --> 19:30.117
Why you got to play me
like that, my nigger?

19:30.119 --> 19:33.254
Aye, man, what'd I tell you
about trying to sound black?

19:33.256 --> 19:35.790
That I'd never be as
convincing as Wayne Brady.

19:35.792 --> 19:37.825
Anyhoo, we're still going out
later so you can show me

19:37.827 --> 19:39.927
how to mack on that
badonka-donk, right?

19:39.929 --> 19:43.164
- Man, hold on. Mack?
- What are you doing?

19:43.166 --> 19:46.367
Just making sure
that tan don't wipe off.

19:46.369 --> 19:48.803
[machinery rattling]

19:48.805 --> 19:51.339
<i>All: Yo, East Chaim, what's the word?</i>

19:51.341 --> 19:53.441
<i>Duncan is fresh,
and you smell like a turd.</i>

19:53.443 --> 19:55.543
<i>Go Black Holes!
Take it to the rim.</i>

19:55.545 --> 19:57.712
<i>East Chaim are chumps,
and we're going to win.</i>

19:57.714 --> 20:00.114
<i>Go black holes!
Yeah!</i>

20:00.116 --> 20:02.883
It's nice being back with y'all,
but I ain't gonna lie,

20:02.885 --> 20:05.052
I didn't hate being the man.

20:05.054 --> 20:07.688
What? It helps my pants
slide on easier.

20:07.690 --> 20:10.157
I'm just glad all them Mileys
and Beliebers gone.

20:10.159 --> 20:11.525
We got basketball back.

20:11.527 --> 20:13.361
Now we can go back
to being legends.

20:13.363 --> 20:16.364
You ain't never lied, Brover.
[laughing]

20:16.366 --> 20:18.800
Last one, I promise.

20:19.102 --> 20:20.067
- Yeah, Randy.
- Buckets!

20:20.069 --> 20:21.068
Up high, fellas.

20:21.070 --> 20:22.103
<i>All: Aah!</i>

20:22.105 --> 20:24.105
Crap slap.
Welcome back, shit crew.

Aah!

20:26.175 --> 20:27.508
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
