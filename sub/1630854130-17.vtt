WEBVTT

00:10.140 --> 00:11.707
<i>I'm doing all of it.</i>

00:15.711 --> 00:18.148
<i>The sleep techniques,
the breath work--</i>

00:18.148 --> 00:20.150
<i>I'm reading all the books.</i>

00:24.198 --> 00:26.330
<i>I'm trying to meditate.</i>

00:32.597 --> 00:34.077
<i>I mean, you know,
I'm sitting there,</i>

00:34.077 --> 00:35.252
<i>and I'm breathing.</i>

00:35.252 --> 00:36.775
<i>I'm doing what you said.</i>

00:52.356 --> 00:54.097
<i>The, uh, exposure therapy,</i>

00:54.097 --> 00:57.361
<i>the exercise.</i>

01:04.281 --> 01:06.414
<i>I am trying.</i>

01:11.593 --> 01:13.160
But I just feel--

01:13.160 --> 01:15.553
I mean, I don't--

01:15.553 --> 01:17.816
I feel tired,
and I don't feel better.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.427
That's okay.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.386
If you don't feel better yet,
that doesn't mean you won't,

01:22.386 --> 01:24.780
and I can keep giving you
all these practical tips.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.695
I'm happy to do that.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.744
Have you thought at all
about what we talked about--

01:32.744 --> 01:35.095
bringing your partner
for a session?

01:36.835 --> 01:39.229
I just don't think
Adam would be up for it.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.101
How do you know
if you haven't asked?

01:42.406 --> 01:43.842
I also don't think
it's gonna do

01:43.842 --> 01:46.062
what you think it's gonna do.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.846
I really don't
have any grand plans

01:47.846 --> 01:50.066
that I'm not telling you.
It's not some trick.

01:50.066 --> 01:53.113
It might help to have
someone you love with you.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.508
You're doing all the work.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.597
I see that, but I also see

01:59.597 --> 02:01.599
it's been very difficult
for you to confront

02:01.599 --> 02:04.472
the possibility that this
may have affected your life.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.518
Or maybe it hasn't?

02:09.346 --> 02:11.392
I know I need to be here.
I know.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.176
I'm doing the work.

02:13.176 --> 02:16.266
I just...

02:16.266 --> 02:18.790
maybe my whole life
doesn't have to be colored

02:18.790 --> 02:21.053
by something that happened
to me over a year ago.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.359
Okay.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.709
All I ask is you think
about bringing him.

02:24.709 --> 02:25.667
That's all.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.061
We are out of time, unfortunately.

02:29.061 --> 02:31.847
Are we okay to pause here?

02:31.847 --> 02:32.848
Yeah.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.656
<i>Female, 60s,
camped out in an elevator,</i>

02:58.656 --> 03:00.267
<i>armed with a kitchen knife.</i>

03:00.267 --> 03:03.444
<i>Alarm sounding
at 3489 Fullerton.</i>

03:05.794 --> 03:10.190
<i>Possible gunfire
reported at 3478 Cermak.</i>

03:22.637 --> 03:23.942
<i>Units on the citywide,</i>

03:23.942 --> 03:26.467
<i>armed robbery in progress
at 3478 Cermak,</i>

03:26.467 --> 03:27.990
<i>Salinas Food Mart.</i>

03:27.990 --> 03:29.296
<i>We're getting calls--
two armed offenders inside.</i>

03:29.296 --> 03:30.775
50-21 Eddie,
I'm real close by,

03:30.775 --> 03:32.473
plainclothes officer--
hold me down, responding.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.368
Chicago PD! Drop your weapon!

04:03.982 --> 04:05.984
50-21 Eddie, 10-1, 10-1!

04:05.984 --> 04:07.116
Shots fired at the police!

04:07.116 --> 04:08.552
I need cars!

04:08.552 --> 04:09.988
<i>All units, hold the air.</i>

04:09.988 --> 04:13.035
<i>We have a 10-1
being called at 3478 Cermak.</i>

04:13.035 --> 04:14.297
<i>50-21, are you hit?</i>

04:14.297 --> 04:16.299
50-21 Eddie, I'm good.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.867
I've got two armed offenders
fleeing southbound on foot--

04:18.867 --> 04:20.390
masked, gloved up,
black clothing.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.174
I don't have eyes.
- Help!

04:22.174 --> 04:23.915
Help me!

04:28.833 --> 04:31.314
Chicago PD--
hands where I can see 'em.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.624
All right.
Anybody else here?

04:36.624 --> 04:38.452
No. They just left.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.280
There was two of 'em.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.935
50-21 Eddie,
I've got a male beaten.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.068
I need an ambo.
<i>- Copy, 50-21 Eddie.</i>

04:46.068 --> 04:48.549
Oh, my God. He's gonna die.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.246
He's got a pulse.
I need that ambo fast.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.509
Oh, God. They wouldn't stop.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.294
He gave 'em everything
that they asked for,

04:54.294 --> 04:55.599
but they wouldn't stop.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.427
Okay, sir. You are okay.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.429
I-I-I couldn't stop them.

04:59.429 --> 05:00.735
I didn't know how to stop them.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.389
I-I couldn't stop them.
- Hey--hey, hey.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.999
Look at me. You did real good.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.870
He's still breathing.
You did real good.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.350
I need you to keep helping me.
Can you do that?

05:07.350 --> 05:08.612
Can you help me?

05:08.612 --> 05:10.048
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.180
Go over there--right there,

05:11.180 --> 05:13.269
and hold his hand.

05:13.269 --> 05:14.923
Hold it--good.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.359
Now, you are gonna
breathe with him,

05:16.359 --> 05:17.969
and you're gonna
keep him awake.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.971
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.191
Slow your breathing down.
Slow it down, slow it down.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.323
All right, in for four.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.326
Hold.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.849
Out for six.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.634
Good.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.070
That's real good.
You're doing real good.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.289
You're helping me, see?

05:33.289 --> 05:36.379
Again--in for four.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.989
Hold.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.862
Out for six.

05:52.526 --> 05:55.137
- You all good?
- Yeah. This thing was fast.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.661
According to our witness,
it was quick and violent.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.663
So two armed offenders,
both masked,

05:59.663 --> 06:01.622
gloved up, entered
through the front door,

06:01.622 --> 06:03.145
fled through the side.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.276
I arrived as they were fleeing.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.235
We exchanged gunfire.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.715
They both escaped.

06:11.066 --> 06:14.112
Employee said the offender shot
out the security camera first,

06:14.112 --> 06:18.334
then demanded all the cash
in the register at gunpoint.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.901
That's all I got from him
so far.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.076
He's in shock.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.382
Why all the mess?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.209
I don't know--intimidation?

06:24.209 --> 06:25.820
They made the owner
surrender all the cash

06:25.820 --> 06:27.125
from the register; he did.

06:27.125 --> 06:30.085
Then they beat
the hell out of him anyway.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.652
They got a victim
who's touch and go,

06:31.652 --> 06:32.827
on the way to Med.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.046
- Anything on POD cams?
- No, sir.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.440
We pulled footage
from a private security camera

06:37.440 --> 06:39.529
down the block,
but we got nothing yet.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.966
Patrol's doing knock-and-talks.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.751
It's a hell of a lot
of damage.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.057
How much was in the register?

06:46.057 --> 06:47.494
$42.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.196
All right, look,
there's gotta be a getaway car

06:54.196 --> 06:56.894
somewhere around here.
Just keep diggin'.

06:56.894 --> 06:59.854
As soon as that
employee's calm, talk to him.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.725
Let's find these men fast.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.647
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.041
I thought you were undercover
with Sam all day.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.085
Callum's sick.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.260
Richard's not at the yard
all week,

07:15.260 --> 07:16.958
so I'm gonna lay low,
work on this one.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.525
Are you all right?

07:18.525 --> 07:19.917
I heard the 10-1 on the radio.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.267
You took close-range fire?
- I'm good, I'm good.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.834
Let's work, okay?
- All right.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.099
Can you tell us anything
about the offenders?

07:28.099 --> 07:29.753
Did you get a good look
at either of them?

07:29.753 --> 07:32.756
No, they-they were
covered up, head to toe.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.584
Well, what about
their voices?

07:34.584 --> 07:35.890
Did either of them
have an accent?

07:35.890 --> 07:37.457
Did they say
each other's names?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.329
No, only one of them talked--

07:40.329 --> 07:42.418
the-the one who beat John.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.507
The other one was just there.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.248
What was
the other offender saying?

07:46.248 --> 07:49.207
I-I-I don't know.
He was-he was just shouting.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.905
He shouted the whole time,

07:50.905 --> 07:52.646
and he told us what to do.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.779
He was smashing everything up,

07:55.779 --> 07:58.303
and he was laughing,

07:58.303 --> 08:01.306
like-like he was having fun.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.004
And he just kept saying,

08:03.004 --> 08:05.006
"It just keeps getting
better and better."

08:07.182 --> 08:08.836
This wasn't
their first robbery.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.707
It's definitely a pattern.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.056
I spoke to Robbery/Homicide.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.450
They've had four similar hits
this month alone.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.758
Same MO--two armed defenders,
masked, gloved, tan duffel.

08:17.758 --> 08:18.802
Only one of 'em ever talks.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.325
Okay, so they enter fast,

08:20.325 --> 08:22.806
shoot up security cameras,
smash and grab, then flee.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.982
They're hitting cash-only
joints on barren blocks,

08:24.982 --> 08:26.418
so we've had no luck with PODs,

08:26.418 --> 08:29.770
but witness from a previous
robbery snapped a photo.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.249
Female offender?

08:31.249 --> 08:33.295
Yeah, it's rare, but they
are a male-female team.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.863
All right, anything in
from Forensics yet?

08:35.863 --> 08:37.952
No, the convenience store
gets a lot of traffic.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.344
They said it's gonna be
a minute to pull

08:39.344 --> 08:40.824
and separate all the samples.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.391
I got that security footage
from down the block.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.132
At least four of those stores
had external cams,

08:44.132 --> 08:45.568
so I could probably
pull something.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.309
All right, good.
Run through all of it.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.268
Where's Torres?

08:50.268 --> 08:52.662
Uh, Ocean's got that
narcotics interdiction seminar.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.185
We got a slim crew, Sarge.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.583
Nothing
from the hardware store.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.193
Camera angle is all wrong.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.021
Yeah, I got nothin'.

09:04.021 --> 09:07.938
Hey, so the hard work
must be paying off, huh?

09:07.938 --> 09:09.418
- Huh?
- The gunshots--

09:09.418 --> 09:11.376
you didn't have a reaction.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.204
Points for Dr. Hammond, right?

09:13.204 --> 09:15.076
Oh.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.208
Yeah, I guess.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.558
I'm proud of you.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.915
Whoa, I got him.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.612
Uh, you have footage
of the alley

09:29.612 --> 09:31.005
behind the gangway, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.528
Where?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.399
- You see that?
- Yeah, she takes her mask off,

09:34.399 --> 09:35.923
but I can't see her face.

09:39.753 --> 09:42.103
I'm sorry, are they, uh...?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.889
Oh, yeah, they are...

09:45.889 --> 09:47.630
they're having sex.

09:53.854 --> 09:57.422
All right.
They came up this way.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.598
It's right here.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.077
He pushed her up
against this fence.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.559
Ain't the strangest thing
I've seen.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.327
We got hits
off the balaclava.

10:32.327 --> 10:35.069
Victim's blood
was on the outside,

10:35.069 --> 10:38.638
and we caught
blonde hairs inside.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.248
DNA came back with a match.

10:40.248 --> 10:44.339
Hair belongs
to a Ruby Bertinelli.

10:44.339 --> 10:48.169
29 years old,
she's got an LKA listed

10:48.169 --> 10:49.692
and a car
registered to her name,

10:49.692 --> 10:52.347
no priors.
- No priors?

10:53.740 --> 10:56.177
Wait, is this is victim DNA?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.223
Yeah, the DNA match came

10:59.223 --> 11:02.487
from a rape kit
performed four years ago.

11:02.487 --> 11:03.793
Are you allowed
to give us that?

11:03.793 --> 11:05.882
Isn't this a violation
of victim's rights?

11:05.882 --> 11:07.884
You wanna tell me
how to do my job?

11:07.884 --> 11:09.146
No, but this can't possibly--

11:09.146 --> 11:10.757
There's nothing
in Illinois law

11:10.757 --> 11:12.149
preventing me
from giving you that.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.981
You wanted a DNA match.
You just got it.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.635
Your offender
was a victim once.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.723
Isn't everyone?

11:23.117 --> 11:24.858
Take it or leave it.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.477
Was the tech wrong?
Is it illegal?

11:35.477 --> 11:37.305
No, not exactly.
Legally, it's murky.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.307
Law doesn't prevent him
from getting a hit,

11:39.307 --> 11:42.136
but, uh, you know,
he had to dig for it.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.224
Well, if we're
legally okay...

11:43.224 --> 11:45.487
But it's not ethical.

11:46.401 --> 11:49.317
It sets a terrible precedent,
using a victim's DNA

11:49.317 --> 11:50.840
to build a case
on a current crime.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.233
Burge,
you already saw the name.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.756
And I shouldn't have, Kev.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.889
The only reason
her DNA is in our system

11:55.889 --> 11:57.194
is because
she was a victim once.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.848
She has victim's rights.

11:58.848 --> 12:02.417
Kim, you're holding her ID
right there--an offender,

12:02.417 --> 12:04.636
an offender who was involved
in five robberies,

12:04.636 --> 12:06.247
the last of which,
a man was beaten

12:06.247 --> 12:08.162
within an inch of his life.
- I know.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.338
I was on the scene with him.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.687
It doesn't make it
black and white.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.211
I know that.
Look, we got it legally.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.997
It would be unethical
not to use it.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.433
I'd never come forward
and report a rape

12:18.433 --> 12:20.652
if I knew my DNA
could be used like this.

12:20.652 --> 12:21.828
She reported the rape
as a victim,

12:21.828 --> 12:23.177
and that's
what it should be used for--

12:23.177 --> 12:24.439
and only that.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.880
Look,
we're not moral authorities.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.186
We're not lawyers.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.753
It's legal.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.710
We're usin' it.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.237
Look, I don't care
what you put on paper.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.499
Leave the DNA out of it.

12:41.499 --> 12:44.198
Do some creative writing
on the back end.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.548
Run her LKA, her car,

12:46.548 --> 12:49.203
known associates--bring her in.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.211
Uh, this is her LKA.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.343
Doesn't look like anybody's
been here for a while.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.607
I'll check the back.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.133
Chicago PD!

13:06.133 --> 13:07.177
Ruby Bertinelli!

13:28.416 --> 13:30.635
Hey, ma'am, how you doin'?

13:30.635 --> 13:32.420
Chicago PD.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.596
Have you seen
your neighbor Ruby around?

13:34.596 --> 13:35.684
No.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.686
She don't really live there
no more.

13:37.686 --> 13:38.861
Why? What'd she do?

13:38.861 --> 13:40.515
Well, what happened?
Did she move out?

13:42.386 --> 13:44.214
Have you ever seen her
with any visitors?

13:44.214 --> 13:45.737
No, she wasn't like that.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.262
She just got
weirder and weirder

13:48.262 --> 13:49.785
and stopped coming around.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.091
Weirder?

13:51.091 --> 13:53.484
<i>Was disappearing
where she was standing.</i>

13:53.484 --> 13:55.747
<i>Why? What'd she do?</i>

13:55.747 --> 13:58.359
<i>Yo, Kev, Kim,
you got your ears in?</i>

13:58.359 --> 14:00.883
<i>Yeah, I'm listening, Ruz.
What's up?</i>

14:00.883 --> 14:03.059
<i>Patrol just called in a hit
on Ruby's BOLO.</i>

14:03.059 --> 14:05.453
<i>Got her car parked
about a mile from her house.</i>

14:05.453 --> 14:07.455
Okay, send that address.
We're on the way.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.196
Thank you very much, ma'am.
<i>- Copy.</i>

14:14.941 --> 14:16.203
Vehicle's unoccupied.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.205
We did a drive-by
but didn't approach.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.728
Plates are a match
for your BOLO.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.513
The vehicle's registered
to Ruby Bertinelli.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.950
You see any POD cams?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.125
No, block is dark.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.343
Need us to stick around?

14:28.432 --> 14:29.651
- Hey.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

14:29.651 --> 14:30.870
They might double back.
Stay on the car!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.132
Copy!

14:32.132 --> 14:33.263
You're good, you're good.
Let's go.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.786
- Let's go.
- Move, move, move, move.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.921
Everybody, get down!

14:38.921 --> 14:41.402
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:41.402 --> 14:42.577
The shots came
from that store right there.

14:42.577 --> 14:43.883
We got it, we got it.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.493
50-21 Eddie,
on scene, shots fired--

14:45.493 --> 14:48.844
possible armed robbery
in progress, 5110 Racine.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.412
- Come on, come on out!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.329
Anybody hurt? Everybody okay?

14:55.329 --> 14:57.331
Call out.
- They're in the back!

14:57.331 --> 14:58.854
- How many?
- Two.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.682
- Okay, up, up, up, up.
- Stay low, go fast.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.118
- Stay low, go fast.
- Go fast.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.946
Here we go.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.610
Chicago PD! Stop!

15:15.610 --> 15:16.785
- Go, go, go!
- I got him.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.875
Go!
50-21 Eddie, I need an ambo.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.878
<i>Copy, 50-21 Eddie.
Ambo en route.</i>

15:22.878 --> 15:27.709
50-21 David, on foot pursuit
of a armed, masked offender

15:27.709 --> 15:29.406
going eastbound in the alley.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.324
Agh!

15:34.324 --> 15:35.717
50-21 David, I lost eyes.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.066
<i>I repeat,
I no longer have eyes--</i>

15:37.066 --> 15:39.112
Stay with me.
Hang on for me, okay? Hang on.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.897
Still...

15:41.897 --> 15:43.029
here.

15:56.259 --> 15:59.654
Chicago PD. Drop your weapon.

15:59.654 --> 16:00.960
Drop it!

16:02.309 --> 16:04.485
Drop it right now,
or I will shoot you!

16:07.053 --> 16:08.054
Ruby!

16:14.756 --> 16:17.324
Denver, 1,001 miles.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
Dallas, 968.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.936
Drop the weapon!
I don't wanna shoot you!

16:20.936 --> 16:22.242
Drop it!
- 1753.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.417
Drop!

16:30.076 --> 16:32.034
Dallas, 968 miles.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.862
Phoenix, 1,000--

16:33.862 --> 16:37.170
1,753 miles.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.262
I got you. I got you.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.046
50-21 Eddie, where's my ambo?

16:44.046 --> 16:47.441
<i>50-21 Eddie,
ambo two minutes out.</i>

16:53.969 --> 16:56.363
Dallas, 968 miles.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.496
Phoenix, 1,753 miles.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.715
Salt Lake City...

17:04.371 --> 17:06.155
Three weeks ago, you crashed

17:06.155 --> 17:07.809
into a Humboldt Park
liquor store,

17:07.809 --> 17:09.680
stole the money
from the cash register

17:09.680 --> 17:11.334
while your partner
beat the cashier.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.119
Do you recognize this woman?

17:14.685 --> 17:17.079
Her five-year-old kid
wouldn't look at her, either.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.689
The next week, your partner

17:18.689 --> 17:22.084
smashed a 71-year-old man's
head against a concrete wall.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.086
He'll be lucky if he sees
out of that eye again.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.132
The witness at this one said
it seemed like the two of you

17:26.132 --> 17:27.829
were having a really good time.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.613
Your partner was laughing.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.268
This man is now fighting
for his life at Chicago Med.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.881
And him, father of two,
number three on the way--

17:36.881 --> 17:39.884
he just bled out
on the cold, dirty tile.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.843
And you, Ruby, you're
responsible for all of it--

17:41.843 --> 17:43.279
you and your partner.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.324
He beat these people.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.239
He killed them
while you watched.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.458
So I'd talk now.
It's your only shot.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.070
What's your partner's name?

17:57.815 --> 17:59.904
He left you, Ruby.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.906
He left you alone,
chanting on the ground.

18:01.906 --> 18:04.561
Don't be loyal to him.
He wasn't to you.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.736
Who is he?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.350
Ruby.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.178
Do you understand
that you are responsible

18:12.178 --> 18:14.180
for all of this?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.660
Until we find him--all of it.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.706
Who is he?

18:24.407 --> 18:25.843
Ruby.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.371
Are you understanding
what I'm saying?

18:56.613 --> 18:57.919
Find anything?

18:57.919 --> 18:59.834
Not yet.
Her social media's real barren.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.488
She stopped posting
four years ago.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.750
Who's this?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.534
That's the man Ruby accused
of rape.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.408
Ethan James Hanley--

19:08.408 --> 19:11.933
32, multiple priors,
assault, two pops for theft.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.064
They worked together
at a bar.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.806
She accused him of rape,
took a rape kit.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.636
What if he's
our second offender?

19:19.636 --> 19:21.116
I don't know, Kim.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.552
Look at his stats--
he's not a match.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.424
You know, the height's
within a couple inches.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.382
He could've lost weight.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.211
It's just that her whole life
changed four years ago

19:29.211 --> 19:30.952
after she recanted, right?

19:30.952 --> 19:32.432
She stopped posting,

19:32.432 --> 19:33.868
stopped making payments,
stopped paying rent.

19:33.868 --> 19:34.999
She withdrew.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.218
Do we have
anything that shows

19:36.218 --> 19:37.959
they're currently in contact?

19:37.959 --> 19:41.180
No. We don't have that, no.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.140
But these are
adrenalized thrill robberies.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.229
I mean, that woman that
I saw at that liquor store...

19:48.404 --> 19:52.234
May-maybe she was
having an episode.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.583
It's kind of the same way
I get.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.238
It was like she wasn't there.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.196
Okay.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.114
Or maybe I'm projecting, right?

20:03.114 --> 20:05.073
I don't know, it's just
something feels wrong.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.857
It's a little bit
of a stretch.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.339
Yeah.

20:10.339 --> 20:14.256
But hey, let's check him out,
you and me.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.214
All right.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.219
Doesn't look like
there's anyone inside.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.700
Ethan Hanley?

20:40.543 --> 20:41.501
Adam.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.394
Chicago PD!

21:14.055 --> 21:15.535
All right, I'm going down.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.459
<i>Clear downstairs.</i>

22:10.459 --> 22:11.547
Clear up top.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.215
He's our second offender.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.174
Ruby's working with a man
she accused of rape.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.835
Tan duffel matches
make and model

22:38.835 --> 22:39.749
from previous crime scenes--

22:39.749 --> 22:41.142
same goes
for clothes and shoes.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.535
And Ethan?

22:42.535 --> 22:43.884
I have no sign of him.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.276
I've got
an investigative alert,

22:45.276 --> 22:46.800
a BOLO out on his car,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.236
alerts on all his credit cards.

22:48.236 --> 22:51.674
So neighbor says Ethan
lives with a young blonde--

22:51.674 --> 22:53.807
hardly talks,
keeps to herself--

22:53.807 --> 22:55.852
just ID'd Ruby off a six pack.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.811
So Ruby is living and robbing

22:57.811 --> 22:59.465
with the man
she accused of rape?

22:59.465 --> 23:00.944
Well,
Ethan was never charged,

23:00.944 --> 23:02.555
because Ruby recanted.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.034
So they were
working together before

23:04.034 --> 23:05.558
and continued
to work together after.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.386
So they've been around
each other the whole time,

23:07.386 --> 23:08.561
close proximity.

23:08.561 --> 23:09.823
She saw him every day.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.695
Yeah, so the rape
probably continued.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.915
The bar shut down,
Ethan started jacking joints,

23:14.915 --> 23:16.656
got her into it.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.048
This girl had nowhere to go,

23:18.048 --> 23:19.963
no place to get help,
she was probably drowning,

23:19.963 --> 23:22.139
trapped, numb--
so she turned off.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.187
You know, she might
not even be fully aware

23:26.187 --> 23:28.668
of what she's doing.

23:28.668 --> 23:32.062
If Ruby participated
in six brutal robberies,

23:32.062 --> 23:34.108
bad circumstances
may have gotten here there,

23:34.108 --> 23:36.545
but I mean, she was there.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.636
All right,
let's dig into Ethan.

23:40.636 --> 23:41.855
Rip this place apart.

23:41.855 --> 23:44.118
Figure out
where the hell he'd run.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.685
Press Ruby again.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.730
Make her tell you where he is.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.476
Where?

23:54.476 --> 23:55.999
The question's
not gonna change, Ruby.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.001
You have to tell me
where Ethan is.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.438
Where is he?

24:03.920 --> 24:09.230
Four years ago, you accused
Ethan James Hanley of rape.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.927
We read the whole file.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.538
You said
he forced himself on you

24:12.538 --> 24:14.540
after your closing shift
at work.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.499
Threatened to beat you
if you screamed,

24:17.499 --> 24:18.587
and then he raped you.

24:20.807 --> 24:21.808
No.

24:26.377 --> 24:27.596
I lied.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.122
It wasn't rape.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.038
And I told the cops that.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.301
Why would you lie
about something like that?

24:50.097 --> 24:52.273
I think it did happen,

24:52.273 --> 24:55.058
and I think you told the truth.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.321
I don't know if the cops
didn't believe you

24:57.321 --> 25:00.063
or Ethan threatened something.

25:00.063 --> 25:02.196
I-I don't know why

25:02.196 --> 25:04.546
you recanted,
but I believe it did happen--

25:04.546 --> 25:05.808
No!
It didn't, it didn't happen,

25:05.808 --> 25:08.768
and I have nothing else to say.

25:08.768 --> 25:11.161
Ruby, you're looking
at multiple

25:11.161 --> 25:13.468
armed robbery charges,
assault, homicide,

25:13.468 --> 25:15.557
attempted murder
of a police officer.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.299
You'll die in prison
of these charges.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.387
Fine.

25:19.387 --> 25:20.693
Ruby, help yourself.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.303
Just tell me where Ethan is.

25:22.303 --> 25:25.611
You're not gonna get me to
say something that isn't true.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.483
I'm not talking to you.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.267
I have nothing else to say.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.143
She still won't talk.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.493
It's like she backs away

25:38.493 --> 25:40.016
every time she gets close
to even thinking

25:40.016 --> 25:43.106
about what happened with Ethan.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.587
All right, so what else
do we have on Ethan?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.110
Well, we do have confirmation

25:47.110 --> 25:48.808
that the blood on his clothes
were definitely blood

25:48.808 --> 25:50.244
from the victims
of the last robbery,

25:50.244 --> 25:51.811
but we don't have anything
on his location.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.247
BOLO hasn't
turned up anything.

25:53.247 --> 25:54.291
His phone's off.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.598
No hits on his credit cards.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.165
Upton and UCs
are sittin' on his place

25:58.165 --> 25:59.862
in case he comes back around.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.560
That man is either
laying real low,

26:01.560 --> 26:03.823
or he already skipped town.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.086
All right, so let's just dig
into Ethan's history.

26:08.088 --> 26:12.222
Charges he's made on his card
the past few months.

26:12.222 --> 26:16.009
Parking tickets could lead
back to a place he frequents--

26:16.009 --> 26:18.315
old properties,
LKAs linked to his name,

26:18.315 --> 26:21.231
associates he'd go to
for help, for cash.

26:21.231 --> 26:24.278
Look, why don't you
go ahead and charge Ruby?

26:24.278 --> 26:27.542
Maybe the charges will
scare her into talking.

26:27.542 --> 26:28.717
Sarge?

26:32.634 --> 26:34.680
I'm trying one more thing
with Ruby first.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.654
I don't wanna be here.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.656
Come on, Ruby, real quick.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.005
You don't need to do this.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.007
It's not gonna do anything.

26:59.269 --> 27:00.401
We're gonna
have to charge you,

27:00.401 --> 27:03.447
and I won't be able
to say you helped,

27:03.447 --> 27:06.059
which means...

27:06.059 --> 27:08.670
you do time for all of it.
- It's a life sentence, Ruby.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.106
Yeah, you already told me
all that.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.499
I know.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.718
I know,
and I wanted to give you

27:12.718 --> 27:14.850
one last chance
to look it in the eye.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.769
So this is
where you used to work,

27:20.769 --> 27:22.118
you and Ethan.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.121
And then, one night...

27:27.907 --> 27:29.865
A terrible thing happened.

27:31.954 --> 27:34.043
A terrible thing
that split your life in two,

27:34.043 --> 27:36.219
into a before and an after,

27:36.219 --> 27:37.786
and I think
that every decision you made

27:37.786 --> 27:40.223
after that was just to survive,
and you did.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.921
I told you
nothing happened here.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.357
Ruby, you can confront this.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.620
I know that you can,
and I'm gonna get you a deal.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.795
I promise, okay?

27:46.795 --> 27:47.970
I will keep you safe.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.363
You'll never
have to see him again.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.582
I will get you help,
but you've gotta talk to me.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.889
You gotta tell me
where he'd run.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.761
Nothing happened here.

27:57.937 --> 28:00.200
I said I don't wanna
talk anymore, and I don't.

28:01.767 --> 28:02.855
Get me a lawyer.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.728
No.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.904
I want a lawyer, okay?
Get me a lawyer.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.471
You could've asked
for a lawyer this whole time.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.908
I know that you know that,
and you didn't.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.475
I think that you wanna talk.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.216
I think you're tired,
that you wanna feel better.

28:16.216 --> 28:17.957
- I don't. I don't. I don't.
- Ruby.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.306
I don't. You don't know me.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.874
You don't know
anything about me!

28:21.874 --> 28:24.311
I know that he left you.

28:24.311 --> 28:28.358
Ethan left you when you were
scared and panicked.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.360
That's not a partner.
That's not what they do.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.971
Stop.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.189
Do this for yourself, Ruby.

28:33.189 --> 28:34.756
I know that you can.
- No, stop.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.323
I want a lawyer, okay?

28:36.323 --> 28:39.152
Now! Get me a lawyer!

28:44.723 --> 28:46.289
Okay.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.045
You memorized this.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.703
You were here with him
when it happened,

29:08.703 --> 29:10.400
and you memorized this.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.578
I know you're scared,

29:14.578 --> 29:16.755
but you can do this, Ruby.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.973
You can.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.848
I don't know.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.371
I don't know,
I don't know where he is.

29:24.371 --> 29:27.026
Okay, you don't have to know
exactly where he is.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.245
Maybe you know more
than you think you do.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.696
I know how to reach him.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.271
Ruby doesn't know
where Ethan would go,

29:55.271 --> 29:56.011
but she says
they use an online game

29:56.011 --> 29:57.056
to message each other.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.535
How do we know
he's checking it?

29:58.535 --> 30:00.711
She said she's sure if he's
alive, he's checking it.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.105
Ethan might not know
that we arrested Ruby.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.541
He ran.
He left her there, cowering.

30:04.541 --> 30:07.283
What if she plays that
she ran out right after him,

30:07.283 --> 30:09.808
and she couldn't get
to a computer until just now?

30:09.808 --> 30:12.723
And what does Ruby think
she's getting for cooperating?

30:12.723 --> 30:14.464
I promised her a deal.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.815
That's not a promise
you can make.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.295
- She deserves--
- It doesn't matter.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.820
Kim, she is going to do time.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.606
There's no way we're
walking back six robberies.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.913
You need to make sure
she knows that.

30:29.349 --> 30:30.263
I will.

30:32.091 --> 30:33.744
All right,
have her lure Ethan out.

30:33.744 --> 30:35.224
Get an ASA onboard.

30:36.747 --> 30:37.879
Yeah.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.272
Kim.

30:44.799 --> 30:49.586
I assume if there's ever
anything I need to know about

30:49.586 --> 30:51.762
how you're doing,

30:51.762 --> 30:53.329
you'd tell me.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.333
And I'm not--
I'm not pressing you.

30:57.333 --> 31:00.902
I'm just saying that...

31:00.902 --> 31:04.079
if I need to know,
you can tell me.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.215
I got your back.

31:11.826 --> 31:12.740
Thank you.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.279
It's better
if you do it, Ruby.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.107
Ethan might recognize
your word choice

31:32.107 --> 31:35.197
and the way you say things.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.330
He'll know if it's not you.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.040
Okay.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.737
Are we done yet?

31:55.826 --> 31:56.740
For now.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.448
Guy sure is taking his time.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.580
He said he'll be here.
He'll be here.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.504
Okay, everybody, look alive.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.332
We got somebody walking
towards the entrance--

32:23.332 --> 32:25.900
male, about 5'10", hoodie up,

32:25.900 --> 32:27.249
<i>can't make a positive ID.</i>

32:27.249 --> 32:29.034
<i>I'ma follow.</i>

32:29.034 --> 32:30.731
Burge and Ruz,
he's headed your way.

32:34.691 --> 32:35.605
<i>Keep eyes.</i>

32:35.605 --> 32:37.868
<i>Hold until we have a positive.</i>

32:50.620 --> 32:52.579
We got a positive.
It's Ethan.

32:52.579 --> 32:53.623
Move.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.103
<i>Slow and steady.</i>

33:00.021 --> 33:01.327
Chicago PD--Ethan Hanley,

33:01.327 --> 33:03.111
turn around
and put your hands up.

33:08.725 --> 33:11.206
Put your hands up
and get on your knees.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.262
Ethan!

33:25.438 --> 33:27.440
Put your hands up right now

33:27.440 --> 33:29.050
and get on your knees.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.747
It's over!

33:30.747 --> 33:33.272
Where's Ruby?

33:33.272 --> 33:34.751
Where is she?

33:34.751 --> 33:36.188
She's not coming.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.841
Why? What did you tell her?

33:37.841 --> 33:39.974
Thing is, I didn't
have to tell her anything.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.323
What did you make her do?

33:41.323 --> 33:43.195
She did it all on her own.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.807
Now, I want you
to get your hands up

33:46.807 --> 33:48.722
and get on your knees!

33:54.336 --> 33:57.687
You know she's a liar, right?

33:57.687 --> 34:00.081
Her head's all messed up!

34:00.081 --> 34:01.604
You can't believe
a word she says!

34:01.604 --> 34:03.606
She's broken,
and there's no fixing her!

34:03.606 --> 34:05.869
You put your hands up, Ethan,
now!

34:14.269 --> 34:15.618
Gun!

34:44.865 --> 34:46.780
<i>He showed up,
just like you said he would.</i>

34:49.261 --> 34:52.786
<i>But he drew a weapon on us,
and we had to engage.</i>

34:54.309 --> 34:55.832
Ethan's dead.

34:59.488 --> 35:02.665
Now, you will still be charged
like we talked about.

35:02.665 --> 35:06.060
You'll be booked,
but your lawyer's good.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.062
Your deal is good.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.333
Ruby?

35:19.552 --> 35:23.164
Dallas, 968.

35:23.164 --> 35:25.427
Ruby...

35:25.427 --> 35:26.559
stay with me, okay?

35:26.559 --> 35:28.387
You're in a room with me.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.475
Can you hear me?

35:29.475 --> 35:32.217
Phoenix, 1,000--

35:32.217 --> 35:33.392
Ruby, I'm here with you--

35:37.961 --> 35:39.789
1,001 miles.

35:39.789 --> 35:43.141
- Okay.
- Dallas, 968 miles.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.186
- Okay.
- Phoenix, 1,000...

36:01.246 --> 36:03.204
How's Ruby?

36:05.206 --> 36:06.773
They booked her.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.731
Uh, she--

36:08.731 --> 36:10.603
I mean, hopefully,
she'll get better...

36:12.561 --> 36:13.823
Hey, Sam texted me.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.999
Callum's still sick,
so I got another 24 off

36:15.999 --> 36:17.566
from undercover.
- Nice.

36:17.566 --> 36:20.526
Mak's got that sleepover.
We could do something.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.223
There's a new fusion place
on Rush.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.356
I don't know what the fusion
is, but Platt seems to like it

36:24.356 --> 36:25.748
even if she doesn't know
what's being fused.

36:25.748 --> 36:27.968
How 'bout therapy?

36:30.057 --> 36:32.799
Is that a restaurant?

36:34.322 --> 36:36.759
Um, my therap--my therapist
thinks it'd be a good idea

36:36.759 --> 36:40.633
if you came in
for a family session.

36:40.633 --> 36:43.157
Okay, all right. Why?

36:43.157 --> 36:44.289
I don't know.

36:45.986 --> 36:48.293
It's up to you, kay?
I can push her off.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.598
I'm sure it's fine
if we don't do it.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.121
I mean, like, come on.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.906
I don't really think
it's gonna do anything.

36:52.906 --> 36:54.647
It's okay.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.388
Let's go.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.346
Let's go do therapy.

37:03.612 --> 37:06.006
Was it that hard
of a question?

37:06.006 --> 37:07.834
Oh, you're looking at me?

37:07.834 --> 37:08.835
Oh.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.274
I'm not trying to be
a problem or anything.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.884
My mind's just kind of blank,
you know what I mean?

37:14.884 --> 37:15.972
That's okay.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.974
You two might be
the same like that.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.933
It's not easy to confront
that something

37:19.933 --> 37:22.544
might've affected your life,
your relationship

37:22.544 --> 37:24.242
without your consent--
your control.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.244
See, I don't think
that the PTS has

37:26.244 --> 37:27.506
affected our relationship.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.116
I mean...
- Yeah.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.900
Kim and I,
we've been through plenty--

37:30.900 --> 37:32.598
had fights, you know,
been out of sync,

37:32.598 --> 37:34.469
but we worked through it.
We'll work through this too.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.777
What do you mean by
"out of sync"?

37:40.345 --> 37:41.563
I don't know.

37:41.563 --> 37:42.695
I mean, you know...

37:46.176 --> 37:47.352
Maybe there were some times

37:47.352 --> 37:48.831
where I--maybe I
felt more and wanted more,

37:48.831 --> 37:50.659
and, uh, you know, she didn't

37:50.659 --> 37:52.487
feel the same way,
want the same things, but...

37:54.533 --> 37:57.623
You adjust.
I adjusted, we adjusted, and...

37:57.623 --> 37:59.407
worked through it.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.148
You had a reaction
when he said that.

38:01.148 --> 38:02.062
What were you thinking?

38:03.716 --> 38:05.848
Oh, I don't know.

38:10.462 --> 38:11.680
Um...

38:14.727 --> 38:18.078
I-I-I-I haven't
ever not felt...

38:20.254 --> 38:21.168
It...

38:23.257 --> 38:24.867
It's not that I didn't

38:24.867 --> 38:27.696
feel the same way that he did.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.874
I did. I, um, I always have.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.574
I just couldn't, um...

38:37.706 --> 38:39.882
I couldn't--I, um...

38:41.536 --> 38:43.451
You know, I was just too...

38:45.192 --> 38:47.063
Okay, okay.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.587
We don't need to keep
pushing that tonight.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.415
That's a good start.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.548
All right,
we have a little more time.

38:53.548 --> 38:56.508
Why don't we move on
to something else?

39:33.545 --> 39:35.155
Adam...

39:41.379 --> 39:42.684
You were too what?

39:46.471 --> 39:49.082
I was too scared.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.477
And numb.
