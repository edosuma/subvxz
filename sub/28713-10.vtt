<i>Anyone there?
I'm on channel four, like you said.</i>

00:09.426 --> 00:11.793
<i>I saw the video at a gas station.</i>

00:13.013 --> 00:14.629
<i>Name's Charles.</i>

00:14.723 --> 00:17.557
<i>Uh, people called me Chuck</i>

00:17.643 --> 00:20.010
<i>back when there were still people
to call me Chuck.</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:24.515
<i>When you get here,
I just want you to do one thing.</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:27.026
<i>Kill me.</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:30.006
<i>I got bit
while I was corralling some of the dead,</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:34.024
<i>and, well, I want to do what you said.
I... I want to help.</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:38.491
<i>The place I've been living, it's got
everything you need under one roof...</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:40.287
<i>uh, a book store,</i>

00:40.374 --> 00:42.741
<i>a bunch of places
to get clothes, a food court.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.330
<i>Hell, there's even an Urgent Care.</i>

00:47.965 --> 00:48.965
<i>Are you there?</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:51.758
<i>Anybody listening?</i>

00:53.554 --> 00:56.388
<i>If you are, by the time you get here...</i>

00:59.142 --> 01:00.474
<i>I'll already be gone.</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:05.184
<i>I don't have a gun or I'd do it myself.</i>

01:05.274 --> 01:07.891
<i>Uh, I've got a red jacket on,
so I'll be easy to spot.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:11.148
<i>Hell, I'll just hole myself up
in the security office.</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:13.070
<i>It'll make it easier for you.</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:19.911
<i>Find me. Bury me someplace outside.</i>

01:21.123 --> 01:22.123
<i>Just...</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:24.911
<i>put me under the stars.</i>

01:26.670 --> 01:27.831
<i>Yeah, that'd be nice.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:07.704
Oh, shit.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.669
He wasn't kiddin', was he?

02:13.008 --> 02:14.374
It's like before.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.336
You think it'll be enough?

02:20.849 --> 02:22.056
It'll be enough.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.273
Come on. Let's go find him.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.774
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna go clean up the strays.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.276
Okay.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.788
Careful. Candy beansies
are jawbreakers now.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.333
Candy what?

02:47.876 --> 02:48.876
Mm.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.612
Hey, did you talk to him?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.537
No.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.451
He must've remembered
what I said on that tape.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.917
He said he'd be here.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.973
Looks like he tied himself up here
till he turned.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.011
Must've broke loose, wandered off.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.059
So we'll find him.
He couldn't have gone far.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.114
You okay?

04:00.198 --> 04:01.860
Think my blood sugar's a little low.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.488
That's why I grabbed the candy beansies.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.366
Well, that and I haven't had one in...

04:11.585 --> 04:12.585
What?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.752
What do you keep calling those?

04:14.838 --> 04:15.838
Candy beansies.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.048
Candy beansies?

04:19.426 --> 04:20.426
Yeah.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.756
- What?
- Morgan!

04:23.722 --> 04:25.133
- Grace!
- Yeah?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.850
Found the strays.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.600
Our voices must've drawn them out.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.893
You think he fell down there?

04:40.739 --> 04:42.150
This might take a while.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.694
You two really thinkin' about
goin' down there

04:44.785 --> 04:46.401
to kill someone who's already dead?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.242
He said he'd have on a red jacket, right?

04:56.171 --> 04:57.171
Grace, that's what he...

04:58.799 --> 05:01.542
- Grace? Hey, hey, hey, Grace.
- Grace?

05:02.511 --> 05:06.425
Need a first-aid kit, please.
Hey, Grace, Grace?

05:07.349 --> 05:08.349
You stay with us.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.176
You just stay with us.

05:48.557 --> 05:49.557
Daniel?

05:51.560 --> 05:54.928
You should get back to the car.
We need to keep moving.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.493
<i>I got a letter this mornin'</i>

06:18.587 --> 06:21.421
<i>How do you reckon it read?</i>

06:22.007 --> 06:25.000
<i>Say, "Hurry, hurry,
The gal you love is dead..."</i>

06:25.594 --> 06:28.302
Grace? Grace?

06:29.598 --> 06:30.598
Mm?

06:30.682 --> 06:31.763
Grace, can you hear me?

06:36.771 --> 06:37.771
Hey.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.432
So, uh, you passed out.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.946
Candy beansies
isn't what you call it, right?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.899
No. It's jelly beans.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.325
Ah.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.695
Here.

06:54.956 --> 06:55.956
Thanks.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.241
You all right?

07:00.337 --> 07:02.329
My mama was an interesting woman.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.715
She both made up answers
and always had to be right.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.343
I had heard people say "jelly beans".

07:09.846 --> 07:14.181
I just thought it was, like,
some name of a brand of candy beansies.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.717
No, it's really not.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.723
Well, I'm glad I didn't find out too late.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.815
We're gonna get you back to the caravan.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.112
What, did you raid a camping shop?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.532
The generator, it's downstairs.
That's the best we're gonna do.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.201
Can I ask?

07:36.790 --> 07:40.283
What just happened, does, uh...
does that have anything to do with, um...

07:40.377 --> 07:41.584
The radiation?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.788
You said it would just be
a matter of time.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.544
It could be the start,

07:49.344 --> 07:52.303
or it could be a cold, exhaustion...

07:53.431 --> 07:56.299
maybe something I ate. I don't know.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.344
Is there anything we can do?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.434
- Morgan.
- Hey.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.020
You okay?

08:05.360 --> 08:08.023
I just had a nap on a real mattress
with fresh, new sheets,

08:08.113 --> 08:11.697
and I faced the truth about candy...
jelly beans,

08:11.783 --> 08:13.649
so, yeah, I'm... I'm good.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.743
What's going on?

08:20.959 --> 08:22.200
Is that Daniel?

08:22.293 --> 08:26.253
Logan and his people just hit
another truck stop not too far off.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.047
So we should go,
circle up with the others.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.904
Way our caravan's growing, we need
everything we can find in this place.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.089
What if they find us?

08:33.179 --> 08:37.014
No, they won't. We were careful.
No chatter, no breadcrumbs.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.638
But they might've heard the same message
that brought us here.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.184
You think they're in range?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.765
Well, uh,
we're pickin' up Daniel's signal.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.814
- Right.
- So we go?

08:45.900 --> 08:48.438
Look, they're pretty pissed about the gas,
all right?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.464
I wanna make sure we're standin'
if they're on their way here.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.674
If they're hittin' truck stops,

08:51.698 --> 08:53.985
we're gonna need everything that's in here
more than ever.

08:57.245 --> 09:01.080
Can you get back to the caravan?
Bring trucks so we can load up,

09:01.166 --> 09:03.579
and send the kids north using back roads.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.667
You should go with him.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.291
- No, I'm staying here.
- You need to get checked out.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.250
Look, whatever this is,
I'm gonna do much better in here

09:12.343 --> 09:14.335
than I will do
in the back of a semi-trailer.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.721
Let me go and get some water
from the car before you go.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.261
Oof.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.723
I'm still feeling a little wobbly.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.020
You... You stay here.
Uh, I'll go get you a bottle.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.482
Thank you.

09:44.793 --> 09:45.793
Hey.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.252
Should get you through till we,
uh, get back.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.176
Thanks.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.386
Be careful.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.012
Hey, you're not doin' careful.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.559
I mean, we both chose somethin' else.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.977
We did.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.808
Could've given up the oil fields,

10:10.902 --> 10:13.519
let Logan's guys
have the gas for themselves.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.445
We needed it. Other people needed it.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.945
That's right. But, see, I've already been

10:18.034 --> 10:21.903
on the wrong side
of takin' what people need. You know that.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.032
Oh, I do.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.909
You turn off your conscience, your heart.

10:29.671 --> 10:33.085
When that happens,
it's harder to turn 'em back on.

10:35.385 --> 10:39.550
So now we're just gonna live our lives
lookin' over our shoulders?

10:40.390 --> 10:42.973
Tell me, please,
how this is gonna end with them.

10:46.146 --> 10:50.015
You know, I have faith in people.
In everybody. I have to.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.230
We're just gettin' to know each other.
Already, I got faith in you, Dwight.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.234
If they come at us, we... we redirect...

11:02.370 --> 11:04.330
we try and make this something
other than a fight.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.456
No, I'm just sayin',
we may need a little more than that.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.502
I think you said it.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.039
We're not doin' careful.

11:16.551 --> 11:17.632
We're doin' right.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.180
I just hope that, uh,
Logan and his people see that.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.476
Yeah.

11:44.996 --> 11:49.491
Daniel, do you copy?
I repeat, do you copy?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.915
I'm headin' south on Ranch Road 1795.

12:02.180 --> 12:06.094
<i>It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,</i>

12:06.851 --> 12:10.686
<i>it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,</i>

12:10.772 --> 12:14.641
<i>it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incre...</i>

12:15.568 --> 12:16.900
<i>...it was the season of Light,</i>

12:16.986 --> 12:18.443
<i>it was the season of Darkness,</i>

12:18.529 --> 12:21.693
<i>it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,</i>

12:21.783 --> 12:25.276
<i>we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,</i>

12:25.370 --> 12:29.205
<i>we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way...</i>

12:29.290 --> 12:32.203
<i>in short, the period
was so far like this present period,</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:34.772
<i>that some of its noisiest authorities
insisted on it being received,</i>

12:34.796 --> 12:35.796
<i>for good or for evil,</i>

12:35.880 --> 12:38.213
<i>in the superlative degree
of comparison only.</i>

12:38.299 --> 12:40.939
<i>There were a king with a large jaw
and a queen with a plain face...</i>

12:56.901 --> 12:58.017
Grace.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.948
I know we said we'd help,
that we would bury him,

13:08.037 --> 13:10.745
but he wouldn't want you
in the ground next to him.

13:13.876 --> 13:14.912
I know.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.544
I wasn't going down there for him.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.211
I was going down there for me.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.632
I've seen people die
from radiation poisoning.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.556
I've seen people get cancer from it.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.472
Every time I cough...

13:38.234 --> 13:39.816
every time I lose my breath...

13:42.113 --> 13:45.356
every time I feel a butterfly
in my stomach, I...

13:47.201 --> 13:50.365
I wonder. I wonder if this is it...

13:52.206 --> 13:54.243
if this is the beginning of the end
for me.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.873
That is no way to live, Morgan.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.377
I... I don't understand.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.636
There's an urgent care clinic
just off the main concourse.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.762
They have X-ray machines,
maybe an ultrasound if I'm lucky.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.474
I want to know.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.862
I need to know.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.286
Tell me what I can do.

14:34.540 --> 14:38.204
Help me get to the generator.
I can take care of the rest.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.212
And you really think knowin' will help?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.336
Yeah.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.175
Then we got work to do.

14:54.102 --> 14:57.095
And after that, let's find him.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.792
You with, uh, Logan?

15:29.387 --> 15:32.175
Look at that. Bright as a bulb.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.966
Look, whatever you came here for,
you're not gonna find.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.097
Had a feelin' you'd say that.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.847
Maybe, yeah,
but I bet you didn't think I'd say this.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.558
I was hopin' you'd follow me.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.319
Why else would I say where I was goin'
on an open channel?

15:58.207 --> 16:01.371
You're right.
I didn't think you'd say that.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.516
Nice driving.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.519
Almost there.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.993
We get to urgent care,

16:36.078 --> 16:38.491
we can get to the generator
through the back halls.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.208
Grace?

17:32.343 --> 17:33.343
Grace?

17:57.618 --> 17:58.618
Shit.

18:00.705 --> 18:01.705
Grace.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.840
In here.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.637
I'm sorry, Morgan. I thought...

18:27.523 --> 18:30.516
I thought it was him,
but that walker's been dead too long.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.434
He's what we're here for.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.274
He wanted help,
and you were trying to help.

18:46.250 --> 18:50.085
It's all right. Dwight,
he'll be back in the morning.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.549
We will get to that generator.
We just have to wait until he gets back.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.858
You look the kind of guy
who's been through some shit,

19:17.365 --> 19:19.482
which is why I can't, for the life of me,

19:19.575 --> 19:21.942
figure out why you'd
do some dumb-shit thing

19:22.036 --> 19:24.153
like walking around with an unloaded gun.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.741
Dumb shit?

19:28.292 --> 19:31.251
Oh, you mean like
following where I was on the walkie

19:31.337 --> 19:33.169
so you can find everyone else?

19:40.638 --> 19:42.379
I reloaded it for ya.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.301
In fact,
I'll give you a couple bullets if you...

19:47.395 --> 19:49.102
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're gonna shoot

19:49.188 --> 19:51.521
unless I tell you
where the oil fields are.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.058
And what's Logan want with 'em anyways?

19:56.904 --> 19:59.567
You know what? Who gives a shit?

20:00.783 --> 20:04.242
I'm sure it started off
with good intentions

20:04.328 --> 20:06.866
until this type of thing
became your bread and butter.

20:08.499 --> 20:12.334
Now, see,
the question you gotta ask yourself is...

20:13.462 --> 20:16.580
"Am I just an asshole now?"

20:20.136 --> 20:21.136
No.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.220
No, I've always been an asshole.
At least, according to my mama.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.320
Look at my face, man. Been through worse.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.070
Whole lot worse people, too.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.364
Aw, I'm sure I can think of somethin'.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.867
You're gonna give me what I want.

20:51.167 --> 20:56.128
I'm not, but you can keep tryin'.
And when I get free...

20:57.798 --> 21:00.757
well... we'll see.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.181
<i>The sea did what it liked,</i>

21:13.272 --> 21:14.934
<i>and what it liked was destruction.</i>

21:15.691 --> 21:17.669
<i>It thundered at the town
and thundered at the cliffs</i>

21:17.693 --> 21:19.053
<i>and brought the coast down, madly.</i>

21:19.653 --> 21:22.145
<i>The air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour</i>

21:22.239 --> 21:24.839
<i>that one might have supposed
sick fish went up to be dipped in it,</i>

21:24.909 --> 21:26.829
<i>as sick people
went down to be dipped in the sea.</i>

21:26.869 --> 21:28.221
<i>A little fishing was done in the port,</i>

21:28.245 --> 21:30.703
<i>and a quantity of strolling about
by night and...</i>

21:32.333 --> 21:33.494
Liquid or solid?

21:33.918 --> 21:35.375
Um, both.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.460
Both it is.

21:37.922 --> 21:38.922
Thanks.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.591
This is all my fault.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.721
We could be up in the food court
right now, eating jars of pizza sauce.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.770
So that you just call "pizza sauce."

21:54.855 --> 21:56.892
My ma called it "tomato toppy."

22:00.820 --> 22:02.561
- Here.
- Thanks.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.029
What's that you're listening to?

22:05.699 --> 22:07.156
<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

22:09.161 --> 22:10.447
Never got through it.

22:10.538 --> 22:14.202
Two hundred and ten words per minute.
Goes by much quicker than you'd think.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.249
Only way I can finish it in a day.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.577
You're brave, Grace.

22:21.257 --> 22:25.342
Just doin' what you're doin',
makin' the most of what you got.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.544
We should all be doin' the same.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.798
I am so not brave.

22:30.891 --> 22:31.891
Yes, you are.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.095
And I've seen it.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.684
When I was eight, I loved horses.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.103
So my parents took me to this dude ranch

22:45.197 --> 22:47.037
so I could see
what it was like to ride on one.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.025
I'd never even seen one up close before.

22:50.828 --> 22:54.822
And there was this one stallion.
Beautiful white mustang.

22:56.667 --> 23:00.536
I got right up to it,
and when I placed my hand on it...

23:01.964 --> 23:03.830
it jerked away a tiny bit...

23:05.426 --> 23:06.426
looked at me funny.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.840
I ran away into my mother's arms.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.803
She tried to tell me
that was just a natural reaction.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.292
She tried to get me on that horse...

23:18.147 --> 23:19.308
but I wouldn't.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.098
You were just a kid.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.484
I just kept screamin' and screamin'.

23:27.990 --> 23:32.155
We got back to the car
and never went back.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.863
Story of my life.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.281
I always overthought everything...

23:38.375 --> 23:43.370
car leases, gym memberships,
relationships.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.171
Made me great at my job but not much else.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.720
Oh, well. Doesn't matter now.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.966
Can always find another horse to ride.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.142
You seen one lately
that hasn't been torn to pieces?

24:00.189 --> 24:01.805
Actually, I have.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.140
I've rode a couple, too.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.111
I'm still playing it safe, Morgan...

24:10.658 --> 24:12.945
doin' things I can finish today

24:13.035 --> 24:16.369
because I'm too scared to start somethin'
I might not get to see to the end.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.911
But if the ultrasound tells you
what you think it's gonna...

24:23.128 --> 24:24.335
is there somethin' you can do?

24:27.883 --> 24:28.999
It'll be cancer.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.217
Thyroid. Maybe in the lymph nodes.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.590
Before, I might've had
a fighting chance, but...

24:38.894 --> 24:39.975
now?

24:41.313 --> 24:42.313
No way.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.614
Did you race cars with your son?

24:59.248 --> 25:00.284
With my son?

25:01.083 --> 25:02.540
Back there when you were...

25:05.421 --> 25:07.788
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile like that before.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.963
I saw the tape, Morgan.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.433
We're in here right now
because you're helping me with my problem.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.724
Least I can do
is try to help you with yours.

25:29.987 --> 25:30.987
Look, Grace...

25:31.071 --> 25:32.687
I'm cooking pad Thai

25:32.781 --> 25:35.694
and listening to books on tape
at double speed.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.906
Give me a chance to do something real
while I can.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.413
It's not the kind of problem
you can just fix in a day.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.793
We got another problem to deal with.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.751
Let's get to that generator.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.273
Did you bring something
to tear my fingernails off with?

26:17.159 --> 26:19.071
Pair of pliers maybe?

26:24.249 --> 26:28.584
I was thinkin' about your question,
and to tell you the truth,

26:28.670 --> 26:32.584
I got no clue why Logan wants that gas,
but he wants it.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.587
And when you go that long
without somethin',

26:35.677 --> 26:39.216
well, it makes you do
even crazier things to get it.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.388
You can understand that, right, Dwight?

26:45.521 --> 26:46.807
How do you know my name?

26:46.897 --> 26:49.810
Oh, come on, now.
You can't go a mile around here

26:49.900 --> 26:51.732
without findin' one of them tapes
y'all made.

26:52.319 --> 26:56.859
I gotta say, when I saw your part,
I thought,

26:57.741 --> 26:59.073
"I get this guy."

26:59.743 --> 27:04.863
I mean, he's all broken up over
what eventually breaks us all..."

27:10.212 --> 27:11.328
snatch.

27:12.673 --> 27:13.914
Don't touch that.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.541
See, that's the thing.

27:17.469 --> 27:21.884
When we get good snatch,
and I mean really good snatch,

27:22.724 --> 27:27.139
and we lose it, well, watch out.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.114
Hm.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.368
"Honey."

27:46.165 --> 27:47.281
That's cute.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.086
Not a good idea.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.294
I'll keep burnin' these things right up
until you tell me.

28:01.638 --> 28:05.757
Or maybe I'll find her myself.
She sounds like a sweetheart.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.812
Go on. Do it.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.946
You're an asshole, too, right?

28:30.459 --> 28:33.918
Yeah. Yeah, right.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.314
Your light.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.408
Turn it off.

29:08.372 --> 29:09.829
We won't be able to see.

29:09.915 --> 29:10.996
Oh, I know.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.454
Morgan.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.878
I need you to turn it off
and just get down.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.715
Don't overthink this, Grace.

29:24.972 --> 29:25.972
I got it.

29:42.656 --> 29:43.656
Morgan?

29:45.409 --> 29:48.072
- Morgan?
- Grace. Grace!

29:58.547 --> 29:59.583
You got it?

30:01.341 --> 30:02.877
You know, I would have if...

30:08.056 --> 30:09.092
Thank you.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.067
We always seem to end up
around generators, don't we?

30:22.154 --> 30:23.235
Yes, we do.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.738
This might take a minute.

30:37.419 --> 30:40.787
My boy, he was, um, six
when I got him one.

30:44.593 --> 30:48.678
Remote-control car.
I got him one for, um...

30:51.099 --> 30:54.683
can't even remember what. Good grades.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.687
What was his name?

30:58.523 --> 30:59.639
He's Duane.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.901
Used to race that car
up and down the street

31:07.991 --> 31:09.527
till it got too dark to see.

31:13.789 --> 31:14.789
He made me smile.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.503
He did.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.707
See, I've always been
a kind of serious guy.

31:26.468 --> 31:27.468
Really?

31:29.346 --> 31:32.054
Yeah, except with them.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.591
That's how I knew it was right.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.437
First date with my wife, Jenny,

31:39.523 --> 31:42.607
found myself smilin'
this giant stupid smile

31:42.692 --> 31:44.649
all night afterward.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.818
I don't think I could've
wiped it off my face even if I tried.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.614
I wouldn't want to
say goodbye to that, either.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.329
You have somebody?

32:06.258 --> 32:07.374
No.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.466
- No.
- Why not?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.928
Same reason why I didn't
get up on that horse, I guess.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.095
I worked with someone in the plant.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.513
He was smart. He was kind.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.650
He let me keep thinking
that candy beansies were candy beansies.

32:30.407 --> 32:31.488
It was right.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.867
And that's why I didn't let it happen.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.589
I have to say, Morgan,
I am so jealous of you.

32:48.592 --> 32:49.799
Me?

32:49.885 --> 32:50.966
Yeah.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.676
You did it. You went for it.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.058
You're the brave one, Morgan, not me.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.312
And now you have that smile.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.588
Go.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.184
There.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.109
Okay.

33:53.657 --> 33:54.864
Hopefully, it's not...

33:59.162 --> 34:00.243
Morgan.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.792
One more. Okay, go.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.424
Grace!

35:04.686 --> 35:06.348
That's the only way out.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.098
How many rounds you got?

35:12.027 --> 35:13.027
Not enough.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.117
Where's the shutoff?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.079
Nothin'.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.006
I'm out.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.836
We need to find something
to block 'em off.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.750
We better get that alarm off.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.362
Let's go.

36:38.947 --> 36:39.947
Grace.

36:43.243 --> 36:44.243
Chuck.

36:45.662 --> 36:46.869
He's alive.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.497
Come on.

36:59.759 --> 37:00.759
Get up.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.258
Over there.

37:10.603 --> 37:11.603
That's good enough.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.440
Turn around.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.522
Just get it over with, man.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.617
You wanna know
why my gun wasn't loaded before?

37:30.749 --> 37:33.867
Because you were right. I am an asshole.

37:35.503 --> 37:39.042
Or used to be one.
And the way things are goin' lately,

37:39.132 --> 37:41.089
I didn't trust myself
not to be that again.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.025
You know, someone gave me a second chance.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.137
That's the same chance I'm givin' you.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.254
What the hell are you talkin' about?

37:56.941 --> 38:01.231
When you walk out of these woods,
you're gonna have a choice to make.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.901
You can go on bein' an asshole...

38:06.576 --> 38:10.365
or you can figure out someone else to be.

38:26.971 --> 38:27.971
Go.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.437
Chuck.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.739
You came. You came.

38:48.618 --> 38:49.618
Hey, bud.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.788
Hey, we've been lookin' for you.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.336
Yeah,

39:02.173 --> 39:04.756
sorry for changin' things up. I...

39:04.843 --> 39:08.757
I meant to leave a note or somethin',
but I didn't know how much time I had.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.639
Figured I should make my move
while I could.

39:14.394 --> 39:19.105
The, um... the stumblers
busted into the security office, and, uh,

39:19.190 --> 39:23.480
they followed me into the stairwell.
I hope they didn't cause you any headache.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.316
- No.
- Okay.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.364
- No problems whatsoever.
- Okay.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.610
And why'd you come up here?

39:35.039 --> 39:36.530
Wasn't sure how long you'd be.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.293
I asked you folks to bury me
under the stars...

39:43.506 --> 39:45.247
but I got to thinkin', you know...

39:47.010 --> 39:49.343
if I could just make it to the roof,

39:49.429 --> 39:51.887
you know, maybe I could see them
one last time.

39:55.476 --> 39:56.762
Just my luck, though.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.182
A cloudy night.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.646
Least I got company now.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.577
I'll be right back.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.947
Stay there.
I've got something that could help.

40:20.335 --> 40:21.496
Hi.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.807
How's that?

40:39.062 --> 40:40.269
It's perfect.

40:48.780 --> 40:49.941
Thank you.

41:35.284 --> 41:38.698
I should wait out here
in case there's any more stragglers.

41:47.463 --> 41:48.579
I don't wanna know.

41:50.925 --> 41:51.925
Sorry, what?

41:52.677 --> 41:54.760
He didn't want to die here
in this mall.

41:56.389 --> 41:57.425
I don't want to, either.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.801
So I'm just gonna believe
there's more than today, Morgan...

42:05.773 --> 42:07.389
no matter what happens.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.850
That's... That's brave.

42:16.242 --> 42:20.077
That's being alive. Really alive, right?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.577
Sorry to make you go through all this.

42:25.084 --> 42:28.919
No, I mean,
we did what we came here to do.

42:30.423 --> 42:31.459
We did.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.378
Dwight'll be back with the others
in a few hours.

42:35.344 --> 42:37.256
We oughta try and get some sleep.

42:38.514 --> 42:42.178
I'm not tired. I know
there's some juice left in the genee.

42:53.863 --> 42:56.230
You really gonna make me
ride this by myself?

42:57.325 --> 42:58.325
I am.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.819
Come on. Come on.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.540
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

43:13.549 --> 43:14.790
Oh, my God.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.510
You look good. You look like a natural.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.592
- Really?
- Yep.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.968
I was hoping they'd have a Cinnabon.
I really like those.

44:03.641 --> 44:04.882
I didn't see one.

44:07.019 --> 44:08.135
They have a Cinn City?

44:08.688 --> 44:09.688
Don't think so.

44:10.773 --> 44:11.773
A Bunnery?

44:13.568 --> 44:14.649
No.

44:15.778 --> 44:16.778
Hey.

44:19.866 --> 44:20.947
What happened?

44:21.868 --> 44:24.827
Uh, ran into one of Logan's guys
out on the road.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.536
And where is he now?

44:27.540 --> 44:30.954
I let him go.
I said we're not doin' careful.

44:32.003 --> 44:34.711
Nah, we're doin' right.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.632
We should get out of here, you know,

44:39.719 --> 44:42.302
so Logan's guys
don't find out where this place is.

44:43.723 --> 44:45.806
We passed an old ranch on the drive out.

44:46.475 --> 44:47.682
It needs to be cleared,

44:47.768 --> 44:49.768
but it might be a good place
to park for the night.

44:50.563 --> 44:51.599
A ranch, huh?

44:52.773 --> 44:53.889
We'll help.

44:55.568 --> 44:56.649
Let's load up.

44:59.655 --> 45:00.941
<i>I see a beautiful city</i>

45:01.032 --> 45:02.832
<i>and a brilliant people rising
from this abyss,</i>

45:03.659 --> 45:07.744
<i>and, in their struggles to be truly free,
in their triumphs and defeats...</i>

45:10.082 --> 45:11.727
<i>- through the long years to come...</i>
- Thanks.

45:11.751 --> 45:15.495
<i>...I see the evil of this time
and of the previous time</i>

45:15.588 --> 45:17.329
<i>of which this is the natural birth...</i>

45:19.133 --> 45:21.466
<i>gradually making expiation for itself
and wearing out.</i>

45:23.930 --> 45:25.922
<i>I see the lives
for which I lay down my life,</i>

45:26.015 --> 45:28.928
<i>peaceful, useful, generous, and happy.</i>

45:30.978 --> 45:33.140
<i>I see the good old man,
so long their friend,</i>

45:33.231 --> 45:36.144
<i>in ten years' time enriching them
with all he has,</i>

45:36.234 --> 45:37.975
<i>and passing tranquilly to his reward.</i>

45:39.612 --> 45:41.492
<i>I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...</i>

45:43.282 --> 45:47.242
<i>and in the hearts
of their descendants, generations hence.</i>

45:48.579 --> 45:53.199
<i>It is a far, far better thing that I do
than I have ever done.</i>

46:02.677 --> 46:03.758
Morgan.

46:07.348 --> 46:08.428
What are you smiling about?

46:10.601 --> 46:11.601
No reason.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.289
- Grace.
- Hey.

46:34.834 --> 46:36.917
- Hey.
- Got us all gassed up.

46:37.503 --> 46:40.962
Oh, and, uh,
grabbed a couple of these, too.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.502
Road snacks.

46:45.636 --> 46:46.922
I'm not goin' with you.

46:55.563 --> 46:58.522
It's Al, you know?
She's, um, out there on her own.

47:02.445 --> 47:04.152
She should have backup, and...

47:05.781 --> 47:07.443
I think that's where I oughta be.

47:10.119 --> 47:11.119
Of course.

47:12.705 --> 47:13.705
Of course.

47:21.088 --> 47:23.205
But you be safe. Will ya?

47:27.720 --> 47:28.720
Yeah.

47:31.307 --> 47:32.514
And I'll see ya soon.

47:37.229 --> 47:38.229
See you soon.

47:40.232 --> 47:41.232
I'll see ya.
