Linda?

01:56.160 --> 01:58.116
- I'm gonna go run.
- OK.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.272
- Morning.
- Good morning.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.192
How ya doin'?

03:23.080 --> 03:25.196
<i>(barking)</i>

03:25.320 --> 03:27.754
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

03:54.080 --> 03:55.672
- Is he out?
- Yup.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.597
Good. Now we can talk about him.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.837
Oh, my God!
Martha, his ass is hairier than yours.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.554
- Very funny.
- No laughs, huh?

04:03.680 --> 04:07.309
The morning team has a sense of humour.
OK.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.671
This is an accident victim
creamed by a truck.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.110
Injury to C5 -
anterior dislocation of the upper segment

04:14.240 --> 04:16.196
with damage to the cord.

05:02.440 --> 05:08.629
<i>(PA) Dr Fletcher to ICU.</i>
<i>Dr Stephen Fletcher, please come to ICU.</i>

05:25.600 --> 05:26.669
John.

05:27.040 --> 05:31.875
I can't tell you how much it means that
you found the time to be with us today.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.629
Everyone! Everyone! Pay attention.

05:35.760 --> 05:41.118
For those of you who haven't met him,
this is Dr John Wiseman -

05:41.240 --> 05:44.516
the genius who saved my Allan's life.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.516
Here's to the doctor.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.477
- Dr Wiseman.
- John, this is Dr Fry.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.352
My name is Esther Fry.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.916
Dr Fry is one of Allan's professors
at the law school.

05:58.040 --> 06:02.238
- We were just discussing...
- Will Allan be able to finish his studies?

06:02.360 --> 06:05.113
Physically, yes, but will he want to?

06:05.240 --> 06:09.552
Let's not talk about this now.
This is supposed to be a celebration.

06:09.680 --> 06:13.912
Yeah. Some celebration, huh, Doc?
Charlie Cunningham.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.750
- How are you?
- I'm Allan's c... I was Allan's coach.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.872
Oh. Excuse me one second.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.031
- How are you holding up?
- Good. I'm good.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.639
Good.

06:37.160 --> 06:41.597
I'd better go freshen up.
Allan'll be here any minute.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.349
<i>(car door slams)</i>

06:55.480 --> 06:59.359
- <i>(man)</i> He's here.
- <i>(mother)</i> OK, everybody quiet.

06:59.480 --> 07:05.077
Everybody, he's here.
Let's all surprise him together. Quiet now.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.671
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.430
Allan! Oh, Allan! You're home.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.351
One, two, three... Surprise!

07:30.200 --> 07:33.590
To Allan. To the start of his new life.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.676
<i>(applause)</i>

07:42.800 --> 07:44.756
Hi, babe.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.758
- Been a long time.
- I know.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.389
I should have come to visit you more
at the hospital, but...

07:57.520 --> 07:59.795
I'm sorry.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.832
Linda, would you get this gentleman
a drink? Double Scotch?

08:06.960 --> 08:11.192
- If I'm allowed.
- Allowed? I'm prescribing it.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.716
Not in a regular glass. We use these.

08:25.960 --> 08:31.557
We never use ice cubes and if
we must have alcohol, we water it down.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.357
Maryanne Hodges.

08:39.480 --> 08:43.313
I've been hired by your mother
to stay and take care of you.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.199
Thank you.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.711
- Who could live that way?
- Sshh. He was looking right at us.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.751
<i>Hi. This is Geoffrey. I can't come to</i>
<i>the phone right now, but leave a message.</i>

09:02.880 --> 09:04.711
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

09:05.760 --> 09:08.718
Geoffrey, where the hell are you?

09:29.280 --> 09:31.236
<i>(bell rings)</i>

09:32.640 --> 09:35.837
- <i>(animals squeak)</i>
- Hello, babies.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.110
Papa's got a surprise.

09:48.080 --> 09:52.551
All right, ladies and gentlemen...
One human brain.

10:02.200 --> 10:06.796
This sample comes from the main
association area of the temporal cortex.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.117
The donor was a Jane Doe
with no apparent abnormalities.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.111
Hello, number six. Come on.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.553
That's it.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.432
Freedom.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.555
Save some for the old man.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.352
Parnate incarnate.
Another night without sleep.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.752
But sleep is just a waste of time.
Right, number six?

10:53.680 --> 10:56.319
Double, double, toil and trouble...

10:57.560 --> 11:01.633
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.952
You have got to get smart on this, sugar.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.876
There you go. I know it hurts, baby,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.788
but beats going back to the jungle,
doesn't it?

11:22.080 --> 11:25.959
Let's get our messages.
Hey, don't you give me that.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.152
Get your little hinny over here
or no midnight snack.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.151
Good girl. That's it.

11:37.280 --> 11:42.479
- <i>Geoffrey, this is Dean Burbage...</i>
- How are you doing, you psycho?

11:42.600 --> 11:45.672
<i>Wednesday 6th.</i>
<i>You forgot our appointment...</i>

11:45.800 --> 11:50.999
- Yes, I did.
- <i>I'd like to see you tomorrow...</i>

11:51.120 --> 11:55.272
I'd like to see you dead...
Wednesday 6th?

11:55.400 --> 11:58.836
<i>(Linda) Geoffrey, where the hell are you?</i>

12:00.360 --> 12:02.715
God... Allan.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.750
<i>(tapping)</i>

12:28.880 --> 12:30.199
Hey, come in here.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.996
How ya doin', Ace?

13:04.120 --> 13:07.317
A lot of changes here.
I hardly recognise this place.

13:07.440 --> 13:11.991
- Equipped for the handicapped.
- You'll get all the best parking spaces.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.032
Ones with the pictures
of the wheelchairs on them.

13:15.160 --> 13:20.234
- I hate to think what Mother paid for it.
- You'll pay her back. Lawyers get rich.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.874
You look like shit. You shooting parnate?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.390
That's one of the advantages
of working in a chem lab.

13:26.520 --> 13:31.992
I finally figured it out. Every three days
that I stay awake, I gain 24 hours.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.554
That's 122 days every year.

13:34.680 --> 13:38.389
So even if I die at 50,
I will have lived 65 years.

13:42.600 --> 13:48.118
I'm sorry I didn't make the party. Linda
called me - she sounded pretty crazed.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.036
Linda's dumping me.

13:54.840 --> 13:58.355
She didn't come out and say it,
but I can tell.

13:59.720 --> 14:04.999
Allan... Linda's just not comfortable
with the change yet, that's all.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.156
She's gonna come around.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.438
Hey, if she walks out on you now,
fuck her.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.596
I can't.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.153
Oh, look! There you are
with the little Palmer children.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.192
Patterson, Mother.
Their name was Patterson.

14:35.320 --> 14:38.596
That's right. I'm terrible with names.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.555
Look, there's their house.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.513
Remember when Mr Patterson
got transferred?

14:44.640 --> 14:46.949
I got the listing and had to sell the house.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.835
You were so angry. You thought I had
something to do with their moving away.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.269
<i>(chirping)</i>

14:56.080 --> 14:59.868
Maryanne! I don't like birds in the house -
the flapping.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.197
- Bogie? Bad boy.
- Bogie?

15:04.520 --> 15:07.910
When he talks,
he sounds just like Humphrey Bogart.

15:08.040 --> 15:11.032
- <i>(Bogie)</i> Sweetheart.
- See?

15:11.160 --> 15:17.952
Look! Halloween. Oh, you just refused
to wear that costume we bought for you.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.710
You wanted to go as that robot
from the movies. What's his name?

15:22.840 --> 15:26.230
Robby the Robot.
I always wanted to be Robby the Robot.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.990
Guess I finally got my wish.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.032
Shit.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.271
Jesus H Christ! Hey!

15:56.400 --> 16:01.235
What do you think you're doing?
Get the hell outta here! Run, you dinks!

16:01.360 --> 16:02.839
Shit.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.954
- Where's security?
- Stop torturing animals!

16:07.080 --> 16:10.117
- Murderer!
- Torturer!

16:10.240 --> 16:13.789
Nice toss! You mentally-deficient puke.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.149
- How're you doing?
- Late again.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.714
Yes. Sorry. Lost track of the time.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.035
Well... What have you got?

16:26.720 --> 16:30.838
Samuels has given me a brain sample
from a young girl who died in surgery.

16:30.960 --> 16:34.748
I've made a formulation based on human
memory cells and injected a monkey.

16:34.880 --> 16:40.637
Is the monkey responding? Is it any
smarter than it was before it was injected?

16:40.760 --> 16:44.878
It's very difficult to measure.
She was pretty smart to begin with.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.231
<i>(laughs)</i>
I don't believe this.

16:48.360 --> 16:54.037
The worm studies reincarnated.
Monkeys are more expensive than worms.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.711
- It's not costing anything.
- It's costing time, Geoffrey.

16:58.840 --> 17:02.594
This programme
has to start showing results.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.358
People who write
the cheques are getting nervous.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.675
I've seen you on three different talk shows

17:09.800 --> 17:13.156
defending the slaughter of animals
for research.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.159
Your work has the anti-vivisectionists
ready to firebomb the college.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.670
That's what's making the people
who write the cheques nervous.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.994
Our approaches are quite different.

17:23.119 --> 17:27.032
Unfortunately for you,
I'm the head of this department.

17:27.160 --> 17:32.518
- Why don't you just fire me then?
- I don't want to fire you, Geoffrey.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.394
- I just want to get you to produce.
- You can't do it, can you?

17:36.520 --> 17:41.594
You can't fire me cos you know
if anybody's gonna strike gold,

17:41.720 --> 17:43.676
it's gonna be me.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.153
- Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. You'll live.
- <i>(hissing)</i>

17:51.240 --> 17:55.518
My ass is on the line around here, sixer.
And yours with it.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.596
You'd better get smart.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.711
This has to work.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.434
Proved out 50 different ways.

18:06.440 --> 18:10.558
You should be playing chess
with the dosage you've been getting.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.592
You're half human, for Christ's sake.

18:15.080 --> 18:19.437
Why don't you show it, huh?
Why don't you show something? Up.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.194
Maybe these other goons
are holding you back.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.756
Maybe that's it.
Maybe I gotta get you out of here.

18:29.840 --> 18:34.595

Yo, Ace! Ace,
I'm gonna grab a brew. Do you want one?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.792
<i>(sirens wail)</i>

20:25.080 --> 20:27.514
- Tofranil. Same dosage?
- No.

20:27.640 --> 20:32.873
Four times a day for the first two days,
twice a day after that.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.635
So... What are your plans?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.037
No plans.

20:39.160 --> 20:43.312
I was going to fly home back to Illinois
next week, but...

20:45.040 --> 20:46.996
I can't go now, not now.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.476
- What if Allan?
- Tries this again?

20:50.600 --> 20:54.388
You're not going to prevent it
by being here. Look at today.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.319
I know it might be difficult
to understand,

20:58.440 --> 21:01.876
but you might actually be aggravating
the situation.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.232
- Aggravating?
- Go home, Dorothy. Go back to Illinois.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.316
Go back to your business.

21:08.440 --> 21:12.831
You'll make it easier on yourself
and on Allan.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.669
He'll be fine.
Clinical depression syndrome.

21:16.800 --> 21:21.476
Tryptizol I had him on was too weak.
I'm switching him to Tofranil.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.711
Allan Mann.

21:24.840 --> 21:30.233
This isn't unusual. Six out of ten
quadriplegics attempt suicide.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.635
And you pump them full of Tofranil.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.479
Have you seen Wiseman?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.352
He's right over there.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.510
- Geoffrey?
- It's Allan. He tried to kill himself.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.517
Wait. You didn't know?

21:46.640 --> 21:50.519
- Then what are you doing here?
- She came to pick me up.

21:51.960 --> 21:56.238
Well, I'll be damned.
How do we diagnose this one, Wiseman?

21:56.360 --> 22:00.239
Clinical asshole syndrome? Clinical rat?
Clinical snake in the grass?

22:00.360 --> 22:03.750
- Come on, Geoffrey...
- And you? You clinical cunt.

22:14.680 --> 22:18.070
OK, Scooter. Come on now. Drink. Drink.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.599
OK. Put your baby to bed. Drink.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.280
No, not for baby. Drink for me.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.909
Good girl. Open.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.713

- Hey, company's here.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.548
Let's go. Cage. Good girl.

22:44.680 --> 22:50.755
Yeah. Get in the cage. Come on, honey.
Get in the cage. Come on. Cage.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.678
Yes. Yes. Good girl!

23:06.480 --> 23:10.792
- Hi. I'm Melanie.
- Hi. Geoffrey Fisher. Nice to meet you.

23:10.920 --> 23:15.277
- What a fabulous place you have here.
- Thanks. I'm lucky to have it.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.188
- You wanna come in or stay out here?
- I'll stay out.

23:19.320 --> 23:24.269
Although my system may go into shock -
all it ever gets is fluorescent light.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.598
So you train monkeys?
Exclusively for quadriplegics?

23:28.720 --> 23:32.269
There's no time for anything else -
the programme's so popular.

23:32.400 --> 23:38.236
As I told you on the phone, I have a friend
who would be a terrific candidate for this.

23:38.360 --> 23:43.593
There are a lot of candidates. All
my monkeys are already assigned homes.

23:43.720 --> 23:49.113
How about if I were to donate a monkey?
One from the lab at the college?

23:49.240 --> 23:52.038
Has to be a female.
Males are too unsanitary.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.357
They go around peeing
to mark their territory.

23:55.480 --> 24:01.874
I know. I've had my share of drenchings.
It's all right. This one is a female.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.711
Well, I suppose if you're willing to supply
the animal, it comes down to my time.

24:07.840 --> 24:12.231
- I could pay you. I don't have much...
- No. I draw a salary from a grant.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.476
It's just squeezing them in.

24:14.600 --> 24:18.912
Starting a monkey from scratch
is a long process.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.192
This monkey's pretty well conditioned.
She's very bright.

24:23.320 --> 24:27.791
She's already been through
a lot of behavioural training.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.235
It sounds too good to be true.

24:34.080 --> 24:37.789
She's normal? She hasn't been exposed
to anything weird in the lab?

24:37.920 --> 24:41.993
No. She gets a med check every day.
She's 100%.

Hey, Ace. I set you up with a blind date.

24:57.280 --> 25:01.398
I hope you don't think
she's too much of a gorilla.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.598
My God! Get away from her, you little!

25:17.240 --> 25:21.438
I'm Melanie Parker. You're Allan? Of
course - you're the only one sitting down.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.596
What the hell is going on here?

25:23.720 --> 25:26.109
She's all yours, Ace. A present.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.118
You serious? You're giving me a monkey?

25:29.240 --> 25:33.074
- How am I supposed to take care of her?
- It's gonna take care of you.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.829
Wait till you see what she can do.
Melanie's been training her.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.270
Here we go. Look at this. Oh...

25:40.400 --> 25:42.470
- Good girl.
- Thank you.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.671
She's looking for her reward.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.872
I'll attach a gizmo to your chair
for dispensing these.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.877
- What's her name?
- Number six.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.877
That's a shit name.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.232
She's a capuchin - <i>Cebus Apella.</i>
I've been calling her Ella.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.749
Ella, huh? It's a little better.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.797
- Hi. I'm Melanie. You're Allan's nurse?
- God has given me that burden, yes.

26:07.920 --> 26:11.071
Could you give me a hand?
I got a truck load out here.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.589
Listen. I kinda smuggled her
out of the lab.

26:18.720 --> 26:23.475
Officially, she's dead,
but nobody knows that - not even Melanie.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.751
So if you could keep that quiet,
I'd appreciate it.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.431
Hey, Ella.

26:33.800 --> 26:38.316
I'd love to play with you. Unfortunately,
I can't, but I sure would love to.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.310
- So what do you think?
- I think it's gonna be great.

- I do think.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.717
She knows you're here
so it makes no sense to call you.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.916
- No, no. There's no way, man.
- Go outside a minute.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.794
- There's no way...
- Don't tell me you're not curious. Go on.

<i>to the phone, but leave a message.</i>

- Christ.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.512
by the carrot or by the stick.

40:14.640 --> 40:19.634
I prefer the stick. It's closer
to what we encounter in real life.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.717
Fear of drowning, for example,

40:23.840 --> 40:28.038

- No. A realist. Please don't smoke in here.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.950
Let's cut the bullshit.
I just stopped by to tell you...

40:37.080 --> 40:41.915
I was taking inventory and I discovered
that one of your monkeys died

40:42.040 --> 40:44.429
several weeks back.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.710
Not the one you've been injecting?

40:46.840 --> 40:51.118
It was one of the others. Ten weeks
back and I still don't have a replacement.

40:51.240 --> 40:56.598
And you're not going to get one until you
file a written report on your experiments.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.233
You really kill me.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.999
You continually ridicule my work,

41:01.120 --> 41:04.590
but you're just dying to find out
if I'm on to something.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.871
I should have gotten that monkey -
the one that died.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.231
For autopsy, I know. I sent it down.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.715
It never got here. How did you send it?

41:14.880 --> 41:17.872
A student.
I don't have time for this bullshit.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.719
You go slice up somebody's testicles.

41:20.840 --> 41:26.551
You can throw away the keys to my
laboratory - I've had the locks changed.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.318
All three of them.

41:41.680 --> 41:44.717
Jesus!
Will you take it easy with that thing?

41:44.840 --> 41:47.035
If you're gonna do a job, do it right.

41:47.160 --> 41:51.438
I'm sick and tired of your insults.
I don't know what's gotten into you.

41:51.560 --> 41:55.678
- I work my butt off around here.
- Bullshit! This place is a pigsty!

41:55.800 --> 41:58.917
You don't change Ella's cage
or fill her food dishes.

41:59.040 --> 42:02.555
This is our house. You have been hired
to perform certain functions.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.399
When you don't perform them,
we get pissed off.

42:05.520 --> 42:08.114
And just who is this "we"?

42:08.240 --> 42:11.073
- Me and Ella.
- That's what I thought you meant.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.829
It's unnatural - you and that monkey.

42:14.960 --> 42:19.511
She is just a dirty,
filthy, sneaky, little beast.

42:20.560 --> 42:25.156
You don't like the way this place looks?
She's the one that leaves it a mess.

42:25.280 --> 42:29.910
Maryanne. Maryanne, come back here!
Maryanne!

42:33.600 --> 42:36.592
- Maryanne!

Maryanne!

42:58.680 --> 43:01.240
Maryanne! Maryanne!

43:16.280 --> 43:18.236
God give me strength.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.308
Get rid of that bird, Maryanne.

43:30.440 --> 43:33.034
Get rid of that bird, or so help me, I'll...

43:33.160 --> 43:35.116
You'll what?

44:36.720 --> 44:38.711

Precise measurement.

46:19.240 --> 46:24.553
And measurement means... repetition.

46:27.120 --> 46:32.114
All right. Let's see if this will make

I thought something was wrong.

47:36.920 --> 47:40.469
Mother, I... I wasn't expecting...

47:40.600 --> 47:44.036
I know. I know. I should have phoned.

47:44.160 --> 47:49.314
But I knew that you would
just tell me not to come and...

47:49.440 --> 47:53.115
What's the difference?
I'm here. We're together.

48:00.400 --> 48:04.109
- I'll do that, if you want.
- Not a chance. It's my pleasure.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.038
I'll make Grandmother's potatoes.
Would you like that?

48:07.160 --> 48:11.870
- He's selfish and ungrateful.
- Please try and find Ella. I'm worried.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.438
I left the door open when I came in.
I hope she didn't get out.

48:17.560 --> 48:23.112
- She's just hiding. Probably in the attic.
- Cos you're after her all the time.

48:23.240 --> 48:26.755
You killed my Bogie!

48:28.160 --> 48:30.116
Maryanne, you're confused.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.835
Not with his hands.
He had his little demon do it for him.

48:33.960 --> 48:39.796
- Ella was in her cage.
- I don't know how you did it, but you did!

48:39.920 --> 48:44.596
The two of you together.
And now my little Bogie is gone!

48:45.440 --> 48:50.116
Maybe it was old age, huh?
Maybe it was a rat that got it.

48:50.960 --> 48:55.795
Maybe you crushed it when you jammed
your foot in the slipper. Who gives a shit?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.795
It deserved to die.

48:58.920 --> 49:01.992
It fucking deserved to die.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.035
Allan?

49:11.880 --> 49:13.393
Oh.

49:22.720 --> 49:25.359
This is embarrassing.
I'd rather Maryanne do this.

49:25.480 --> 49:29.871
What's the matter?
I've never seen you naked? Come on.

49:30.920 --> 49:33.480
Anyway, you're stuck with me.

49:34.520 --> 49:37.432
- Maryanne's leaving.
- Maryanne's leaving?

49:37.560 --> 49:40.393
- Uh-huh.
- You mean while you're here?

49:40.520 --> 49:46.117
No, she's quitting. She called me last
week and said she was looking for work.

49:46.240 --> 49:48.196
Last week?

49:54.040 --> 49:57.032
- Bitch.
- Allan, it's all right.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.799
Actually, her timing couldn't be better.

49:59.920 --> 50:03.276
Her decision helped me
reach a decision of my own -

50:03.400 --> 50:06.039
one that I've been procrastinating about...

50:06.160 --> 50:07.798
What is it?

50:07.920 --> 50:10.309
Well... I hope you approve.

50:10.440 --> 50:15.639
I've sold my business.
I'm selling the house in Lake Forest.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.990
You're planning on moving in?

50:18.960 --> 50:24.193
It's the only solution, Allan.
Don't worry. I'll stay out of your way.

50:24.320 --> 50:27.551
I know you're a very private person.

50:28.600 --> 50:34.914
At the same time, I'll be able to help.
I'll be here when you need me.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.037
Mother... Mother, my hand moved.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.991
- Did you see it?
- Allan, please...

50:44.120 --> 50:46.680
Did you see my fucking hand move
or didn't you?!

50:46.800 --> 50:52.318
No, I did not. There is nothing to see.
Your hand did not move. It cannot move.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.710
I don't like the way you're behaving.
I don't like it at all.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.712
<i>(horn)</i>

51:27.640 --> 51:30.871
<i>(intercom) Allan, what is it?</i>
<i>Want anything?</i>

51:31.000 --> 51:35.869
Uh... No. No, Mother. I'm all right.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.438
- <i>Do you have to go to the bathroom?</i>
- No, I'm all right. Just leave me alone.

51:43.880 --> 51:46.553
Just leave me alone.

51:57.720 --> 52:02.271
You can get out of this cage, can't you?
You can get out of this house.

52:47.400 --> 52:51.109
Ella... you little devil, you.

52:54.480 --> 52:58.359
Nothing. There's no way
she could be getting out.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.948
She's coming in wet, covered with mud.

53:01.080 --> 53:04.152
Allan, look at me. The attic is a mess.

53:04.280 --> 53:06.953
Leaks in the roof.
It's been raining in there.

53:07.080 --> 53:11.312
Ella is getting out of the house.
If it's not the attic, it's some other way.

53:11.440 --> 53:14.000
And I'm getting out with her.

53:14.120 --> 53:19.638
These dreams I've been having... They're
not dreams. It's more like experiences.

53:19.760 --> 53:22.274
It's like I'm in Ella's body.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.075
Running with her strength.
Seeing through her eyes.

53:27.240 --> 53:31.950
- I'm part of her. She's part of me.
- You do know that that's impossible.

53:32.080 --> 53:36.119
No, I don't know.
It is not impossible. It's happening.

53:36.240 --> 53:38.629
You're talking about telepathy, Ace.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.638
Some sort of mind meld. Come on.

53:41.760 --> 53:47.312
I know there's a strong bond between you
and Ella, but... paranormal contact?

53:47.440 --> 53:49.874
It's impossible. It just can't be.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.357
Allan, are you all right?
Do I need to start worrying about you?

53:54.480 --> 53:59.076
No, I'm fine.
Just an overactive imagination, I guess.

54:08.400 --> 54:12.393
My hand moved - I saw it move -
but Wiseman says that's impossible.

54:12.520 --> 54:16.399
You should always get a second opinion
with something serious.

54:16.520 --> 54:19.193
Even with the brilliant John Wiseman.

54:19.320 --> 54:22.915
- Do I detect a note of sarcasm?
- Wiseman's overconfident.

54:23.040 --> 54:27.591
- Sometimes he... misses things.
- He missed something with Allan?

54:27.720 --> 54:32.157
I don't know, but it looks to me
like you've got a congenital problem.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.794
This injury here
was caused by the accident -

54:34.920 --> 54:38.754
it's what Wiseman repaired
and it looks like a competent job.

54:38.880 --> 54:43.556
But I don't think this is what's
causing your paralysis. See this?

54:43.680 --> 54:47.355
This abnormality doesn't look
like it was caused by trauma.

54:47.480 --> 54:50.233
If this is the culprit...

54:50.360 --> 54:56.151
then your paralysis could have come on
crossing the street, lying in bed.

54:56.280 --> 54:58.953
The accident could have been
a tragic coincidence.

54:59.080 --> 55:00.195
Tragic?

55:00.320 --> 55:03.995
Without the accident,
the docs might have looked harder.

55:04.120 --> 55:08.352
They probably figured you got hit
by a truck, spinal damage, case closed.

55:08.480 --> 55:14.430
So if they... he had looked harder
and he found what you found...

55:15.720 --> 55:18.678
- Could he have fixed it?
- Can you fix it?

55:18.800 --> 55:21.519
This is a very inexact specialty.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.757
Let me run some more tests
before you ask me that question.

55:29.560 --> 55:33.439
<i>- (growling)</i>
<i>- (thinks) Wiseman. That motherfucker.</i>

55:34.880 --> 55:38.793
That self-satisfied son of a bitch.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.638
If he did this to me...

55:41.280 --> 55:45.637
If he put me through this for no fucking
reason other than his own incompetence.

55:45.760 --> 55:50.709
- Allan. Don't waste your time on anger.
- That son of a bitch.

55:51.920 --> 55:54.150
Ego-fucking-maniac. I could...

55:54.280 --> 55:58.353
I don't understand this reaction.
You're letting bad news overshadow good.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.950
There's hope - not false hope, real hope.

56:02.080 --> 56:05.356
Just when things
might turn your way, you...

56:08.840 --> 56:11.434
I don't like this change in you, Allan.

56:47.800 --> 56:50.030
- <i>Dr Wiseman's office.</i>
- Is he there?

56:50.160 --> 56:54.073
<i>We don't expect him back until Monday.</i>
<i>He's taken a few days off.</i>

56:54.200 --> 56:56.191
I have to talk to him.

56:56.320 --> 57:00.472
- <i>Well, if it's an emergency...</i>
- It is an emergency.

57:00.600 --> 57:03.592
<i>OK. He left a number</i>
<i>where he can be reached.</i>

57:03.720 --> 57:06.951
<i>Let me see... It's JL-5...</i>

57:07.080 --> 57:09.799
9-7-2-9.

57:09.920 --> 57:15.153
- <i>You already have that number?</i>
- Yes. I have that number.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.916
<i>(rings)</i>

57:39.680 --> 57:41.272
Hello?

57:42.960 --> 57:44.552
Hello?

57:47.720 --> 57:49.472
Hello?

57:49.600 --> 57:51.556
<i>(hangs up)</i>

57:54.600 --> 57:57.034
- Hung up.
- Oh.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.750
Hate it when that happens.

58:02.760 --> 58:04.716
It always scares me.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.076
<i>(sighing)</i>

59:40.200 --> 59:43.715
Oh, my God. Both of them?

59:44.760 --> 59:48.878
You mean they were together?
Oh, my God!

59:49.000 --> 59:51.468
What am I gonna tell Allan?

59:51.600 --> 59:56.993
Oh. Allan just came in.
Yes, I will. Thank you for calling.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.112
Allan, something terrible has happened.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.196
- There was...
- A fire.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.958
- Take her away.
- Ace, Ella could not have done this.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:23.870
I think she did do it. I think she did it
for me. Because I wanted it done.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.834
You wanted them to die in a fit of anger.
That's a normal reaction.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.916
These people fucked you over.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.556
Now this thing happens - it's coincidence -
and you're blaming it on yourself.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.992
It wasn't a fit of anger.
I thought about it - of ways of doing it.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.672
Fire was one of those ways. I knew that
old cabin. I knew that it would burn fast.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.109
Allan...

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.838
- Did you do that or did she?
- She did it. She acts on her own as well.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.116
That worries me too. What she might do
when she's been exposed to...

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.471
- Exposed to what?
- Geoff...

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.909
I've been so full of anger.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.553
I've had the most horrible thoughts lately.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.309
It's like vomiting up
every resentment I ever had.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.989
Every ugly, vicious, sinful...

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.788
That's what it is - it's sin.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.274
It's the desire to sin, Geoff.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.711
- If Ella's plugged into that...
- You did not cause that fire, nor did Ella.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.709
Animals are instinctively terrified of fire.
They won't go near a naked flame.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.632
Was that an instinctive reaction?
Or does she just know what fire can do?

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.876
Christ. All right...

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:01.192
I'll take her down to the lab
and run whatever tests I can run on her.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.199
Though I don't expect to find sin
in a urine sample.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.196
<i>(whimpers)</i>

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.714
- Sorry, Melanie.
- That's...

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.512
- Don't bring her back.
- I'll check with you on Monday.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:56.234
Why don't you stay here tonight?
You could stay for the weekend.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.436
Different environment. Fresh air.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.111
How could you handle it?
Just getting me in and out of bed...

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.438
I've got the practice room in the barn.
Got all the equipment.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.599
I think it'll be warm enough.
Got plenty of blankets.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:18.229
We'll try to forget it. For two days,
we will try to forget everything.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.272
- Deal?
- I'll try.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.358
I really will try. I just...

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.988
I can feel myself coming back to normal.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.833
Every minute,
that rage just gets lifted away.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.432
Every minute you're with me
or every minute you're away from Ella?

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.118
Both.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.515
Bedtime?

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.392
I'm sorry.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.029
<i>(agitated chattering)</i>

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.200
I could enrol you in the college, Ella.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.593
These other idiots
are still pissing on their feet.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.473
They're all getting the same dosage.
The missing ingredient must be Allan.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.349
My God. You want it?

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.835
What? No complaint?

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.640
I've turned you into a fucking junkie.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.790
What else have I turned you into? Has this
stuff plugged you into Allan somehow?

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.715
Seven bottles of beer on the wall.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.788
You didn't do it, did you, Ella? All that
stuff that Allan's been blaming on you?

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.356
I know that you've been getting
out of the house...

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:37.198
but you couldn't have committed murder.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.759
I don't know. I just can't be sure.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.590
You weren't trying to make
your hand move. It moved by itself.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.553
Spinal surgery is risky business.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:00.073
Without some proof, some more positive
sign, I can't recommend taking that risk.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.192
- What kind of sign?
- A voluntary movement.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.356
A movement you make deliberately -

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:08.517
even if it's only a finger or a toe.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.189
Show me that you can do that
and I'll say, "Let's operate."

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.837
- Hello, Mother.
- Where have you been?

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.952
- At school.
- Where have you been all weekend?

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.640
I tried to call you at least a dozen times.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.319
We decided not to answer the phone.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.716
Mel, don't come in.
I just don't want any bullshit.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.399
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mel, don't.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.875
I don't want any bullshit either.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.519
Hi, Mrs Mann. How are you today?

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.113
Burbage.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.956
Jesus. He's got it.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.076
He's got the serum.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.676
Motherfucker!

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.434
Burbage won't learn anything.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.279
Not from you, you simple bastards.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.630
He won't learn diddly shit.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.028
Maybe...

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.150
Maybe I still can from you, sugar.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.350
One bottle of beer on the wall.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.913
One last dose. Not for you this time.
This time, it's for me.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.191
If this shit can plug you into Allan's head,

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.914

Let's make contact, Ella.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.800
Show me what you can do.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.790
- You didn't hear from Geoffrey?
- Why would I?

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.392
- He... He has Ella.
- He can keep her for all I care.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.752
I told him to keep her, Mother. I told him
not to bring her back. She's gone.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.440
She did something to that girl, didn't she?

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.429
She did something to that Melanie
and she asked you to get rid of her.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.030
You'd do anything she asks in a minute.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.755
Mother, let's try and bury the hatchet.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.908
Look, I know I haven't been
very pleasant to be around lately.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:28.869
I'm gonna try and fix that.
Do you think you could do the same?

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.310
What am I supposed to fix, Allan?
What have I done?

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.000
What have I ever done
except worry about you?

Mother, this business about Melanie.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.917
I need your support, not discouragement.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.033
However things turn out medically,
with or without the use of my body,

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.958
I'm gonna try to make it work between us.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.072
- Whatever you want is fine with me.
- Oh, bullshit!

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.749
You're so fucked up, you can't even!

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.956
Mother, she's here.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.594
Ella's here. She's in the house.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.396
I think you've got a serious problem.
I think you're going crazy on me.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.593
She's here. I can feel her.
Filling me up with...

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.632
- For God's sakes...
- There's danger.

The way I've been acting, these rages -
Ella pulls them out of me.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.155
She pulls them to the surface.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.273
What is this? Is this some sort of game
that you're playing?

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.631
If you can't stand having me here,
just tell me, I'll go.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.753
- You don't have to put me through this.
- Mother, please stop.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.749
Please don't make me angry.
I can't control it. It's Ella. She...

- <i>Can Allan come to the phone?</i>
- No. He's in the bath.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.758
<i>OK. Would you ask him</i>
<i>to call me when he gets out?</i>

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.350
He's going to bed.
Call him tomorrow in the daytime.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.511
Mother, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have shouted at you. I'm afraid.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.473
I'm afraid for you, Mother.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.513
If you ever tried to understand anything,
try to understand this.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.359
I understand. I understand the truth.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.189
You've made it plain.
I just was never willing to accept it.

Do you have any idea how worthless
you've made me feel? How alone?

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:57.150
- I've given up everything for you!
- Who asked you to give up anything?

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.795
You don't give a shit
about me or anybody else.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.275
You're too wrapped up in yourself.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.394
Your life is nothing
but an empty, greedy, black hole

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.672

What if I was an animal?
Free to follow my instincts.

That's what the devil is, Geoff. It's instinct.

Animal instinct.

Kitchen. The switch is in the kitchen,
baby. Go ahead.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.393
Oh, you're too savvy for that one,
aren't you? It's OK.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:23.159
We'll try it again later.
How about food? Food. Mmm.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.079
Yeah. I'm hungry. Eat, Ella. Eat.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.236
Atta girl. Go ahead.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.869
Hey! Hey, over here!

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.391
Hey! Over here!

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.918
Help me! Help me!

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:03.360
- Help me, please!

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.910
All right.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.599
All right. No more tricks.
No more tricks, baby.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.274
So you're not afraid of fire.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.234
Thank you, Ella. No more food.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.276
No more food, Ella.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.994
No more food. Food, no.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:21.155
Ella... Let's go outside.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.116
Go outside. Run.

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.833
Play.

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.758
Like we used to. Come on, baby.

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.428
Go outside. Go away.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.958
Take me away, Ella. Come on, baby.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.073
Take me away. Yeah.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.519
Mel, no. Go away. Go away. Don't come.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.632
<i>(growling)</i>

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.595
Mel, go away. Stay away.

01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:20.799
- Are you all right? What happened?
- Mel, get away from here.

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:24.993
- Where's Geoffrey?
- He's not here.

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:28.430
- His car's outside.
- Leave us alone. I don't wanna hurt you.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.950
I couldn't stand it if I hurt you too.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.317
- Mel, please go. Go quickly.
- Allan, what?

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.752
Stop it!

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.359
Ella, no!

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.350
- Did you do that or did she?
- She did.

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:14.758
That's right. She did it. Not you.
You had nothing to do with it.

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.675
Mel?

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.475
Come on, wake up.
Come on, Melanie. Wake up.

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.111
Mel?

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.197
Ella, no! Stop. Ella! Get out of there!

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.957
Get out of there, you bitch!

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.197
Stop it! Get away from her!

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.436
Get out of there! Stop it, Ella!

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.313
Come on, Mel. Wake up.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.795
Come on, Mel.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.994
Melanie.

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.271
Ella, no! No! Get out of there!

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.236
No! No!

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.032
Stop it!

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:34.189
Get away from me.
Get away from me, you!

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.116
You slime.

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.236
You filth.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.390
I'm gonna take you apart.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.513
I'm gonna rip your fucking eyes out.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:00.550
I'm gonna tear you open
and chew out your fucking heart.

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:16.353
Oh, God. Melanie.

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.230
- Oh.
- Come on, Mel. Wake up.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.672
You gotta wake up, Mel. Ella, no.

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.189
Ella, no. Bring me that needle.

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.113
Fetch it to me. Come on, Ella.

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:40.270
I thought we were gonna be friends.
I thought we were gonna go run and play.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.992
Ella.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.832
Come on.

Come here, baby.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.990
Nice music, huh?

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:48.033
Come on up here, baby. Come on, please.

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.310
Come here, Ella.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.671
Come on next to me. I want you close.

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.156
Come on.

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.115
Don't you love me? I love you.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.837
That's my girl. Come over.
Come on and hold me.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.837
Hold me, baby.

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.153
Come on.

- Aagh!
- Allan!

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.269
It's OK. It's all right. You had a dream,
that's all. Just a bad dream.

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.994
I'm here. I'm with you.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:59.712
Your surgery's over. It's OK.

Melanie...

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:08.036
- It's over? Really?
- Yeah.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:11.391
- They did the work on my spine?
- Yeah.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.790
What did they say?
Do I get my body back?

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.189
Come on, Ace. Let's go fishing.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:43.351
Thank you.
