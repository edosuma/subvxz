00:05.973 --> 00:08.388
Emily this calls for you
from a Sean McAllister

00:08.463 --> 00:11.748
came to my phone accidentally.
It sounded very important.

00:11.816 --> 00:13.183
Sean.

00:13.251 --> 00:16.186
I was gonna call you back.
I just--I got busy on a case.

00:16.254 --> 00:19.456
Ian Doyle vanished
from prison.

00:19.524 --> 00:20.590
Interpol can't find him.

00:20.658 --> 00:21.825
Am I in danger?

00:21.893 --> 00:22.926
We all are.

00:22.994 --> 00:25.495
Sean thinks
we're all in danger.

00:25.563 --> 00:30.000
But I was the only one who had
any personal connection to him.

00:30.067 --> 00:31.935
As far as Doyle
is concerned,

00:32.003 --> 00:34.337
Lauren Reynolds died
in a car accident.

00:34.405 --> 00:36.139
You died and we're all good.

00:36.207 --> 00:37.474
I want to hear you
say it.

00:37.525 --> 00:39.242
Lauren Reynolds is dead.

00:40.244 --> 00:41.278
Bye.

00:41.345 --> 00:42.579
Who's Lauren Reynolds?

00:51.255 --> 00:52.355
They got her.

00:52.423 --> 00:54.324
Drop the phone.
Get on the ground, now.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.530
- Tsia?
- He's gone.

01:00.598 --> 01:02.098
Jeremy's dead.

01:02.166 --> 01:04.885
How long have
we been talking?

01:04.968 --> 01:06.503
You've gotta get out of there.

01:06.571 --> 01:07.904
Oh, God.

01:07.972 --> 01:09.406
It's Doyle, isn't it?

01:09.474 --> 01:11.391
Toss that cell phone
and get home safely.

01:19.484 --> 01:21.418
Prentiss,
what's going on with you?

01:21.486 --> 01:23.720
I've been watching you
the last couple of days

01:23.788 --> 01:24.623
and something is obviously
bothering you.

01:24.818 --> 01:28.587
Derek, because I like you, I'm going
to ask you not to do this.

05:22.109 --> 05:24.444
I was beginning to think
you weren't coming.

05:24.528 --> 05:27.397
After what happened
to Jeremy, I was afraid.

05:27.448 --> 05:31.951
Tsia, I'm sorry you can't be at
his funeral. It's today, isn't it?

05:32.036 --> 05:35.071
Well, that's the problem with marrying
a member from your own team.

05:35.122 --> 05:37.607
One of you is a target,
so is the other. I get it.

05:37.658 --> 05:39.909
Hello, darling.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.079
All right, let's make this quick.
I took a late lunch.

05:43.147 --> 05:45.248
How many times
do I have to tell you?

05:45.316 --> 05:47.917
I'm not quick
about anything.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.252
I don't know.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.756
What about that time
I blew my cover in Prague?

05:52.823 --> 05:55.325
You took out that sentry before
I could even draw my weapon.

05:55.392 --> 05:57.477
You saved my ass, Clyde.

05:57.561 --> 06:00.764
I'm surprised you remember the
little people from your Interpol days

06:00.831 --> 06:03.683
now that you're a posh
FBI profiler.

06:03.768 --> 06:05.518
What's being done
to locate Doyle?

06:05.603 --> 06:09.189
Only every agency in the Northern
hemisphere is looking for him.

06:09.273 --> 06:10.707
What are we doing
to find him?

06:10.741 --> 06:15.678
My contact at DCRI
tracked one of Doyle's aliases

06:15.746 --> 06:17.697
leaving France the day after
Jeremy's murder.

06:17.782 --> 06:20.033
He took a commercial flight
to Beijing,

06:20.117 --> 06:21.818
then doubled back
on a train bound for Berlin.

06:21.869 --> 06:26.122
But when GSG 9 intercepted it,
he was already gone.

06:26.190 --> 06:29.459
He sent me flowers, so I think
it's safe to assume he's coming here.

06:29.510 --> 06:31.494
Why is he doing this?

06:31.545 --> 06:34.047
Why do you think?
We put him away.

06:37.768 --> 06:40.270
Duty calls?

06:42.273 --> 06:44.340
I know
what you're thinking.

06:44.408 --> 06:46.810
Absolutely not.

06:46.877 --> 06:48.678
Your team
isn't under oath.

06:48.746 --> 06:50.313
They don't
have clearance.

06:50.381 --> 06:51.314
They could help.

06:51.382 --> 06:52.649
How?

06:52.716 --> 06:54.884
We don't even know
where Doyle is.

06:54.952 --> 06:57.620
Involving them at this
point would be premature.

06:57.688 --> 06:59.289
And reckless.
Leave it to Tsia and I.

06:59.356 --> 07:00.824
You go be
with your team.

07:00.875 --> 07:04.194
Even in hiding Doyle can't resist
extravagance. Track the money.

07:04.261 --> 07:06.196
I will find him,
darling.

07:06.263 --> 07:07.664
Trust me.

07:07.715 --> 07:10.917
I don't trust anyone anymore.

07:18.759 --> 07:20.710
Traffic. I'm sorry.
Let's get started.

07:20.761 --> 07:24.380
Ok. 10-year-old Sammy Sparks
of Lafayette Parish, Louisiana,

07:24.448 --> 07:26.816
showed up at his elementary
school this morning covered in blood.

07:26.884 --> 07:28.568
When police
got to his house,

07:28.652 --> 07:31.187
they found that his parents,
Charlie and Alison Sparks, were missing.

07:31.238 --> 07:33.690
Well, forensics indicate
that at least one of them was injured,

07:33.741 --> 07:35.358
and by the looks of it,
it was pretty severely.

07:35.426 --> 07:36.659
Has there been
a ransom demand?

07:36.727 --> 07:38.394
There's been no
communication whatsoever.

07:38.445 --> 07:39.946
Then why call in
the BAU?

07:40.030 --> 07:42.131
New Orleans is hoping
we can interview Sammy.

07:42.199 --> 07:43.733
No one's talked to
the witness yet?

07:43.784 --> 07:45.902
I don't understand.
If Sammy was covered with blood,

07:45.953 --> 07:48.070
there's a good chance
he could identify the unsub.

07:48.122 --> 07:50.240
Sammy's autistic.
Getting him to tell us what happened

07:50.307 --> 07:51.591
isn't gonna be easy.

"Tomorrow, you promise

yet tomorrow is too often
a repetition of today."

08:34.337 --> 08:37.506
Author James T. McCay.

08:37.557 --> 08:40.208
Is that the one where
they fly around in the phone booth?

08:40.277 --> 08:42.528
First of all, it's a police box,
not a phone booth.

08:42.611 --> 08:44.947
Second of all, Dr. Who
started a quarter of a century

08:45.015 --> 08:47.116
before Bill and Ted even went on
their bodacious adventure,

08:47.184 --> 08:49.518
so, really, they should have just called
it "Bill and Ted's Excellent Rip-Off."

08:49.569 --> 08:51.887
- I mean, at least then--
- I'm really sorry.

08:51.955 --> 08:54.290
Asking.
For what?

08:55.575 --> 08:58.227
Good morning, Angels.
New information to report.

08:58.295 --> 09:01.363
The blood at the crime scene
matched type to Charlie Sparks,

09:01.431 --> 09:03.365
so we can assume that
he is the injured party.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.701
Well, shell casings by
the door says he was shot.

09:05.769 --> 09:07.369
Are we looking at
a robbery gone wrong?

09:07.437 --> 09:10.039
No robber would break
into a family residence

09:10.107 --> 09:13.375
before the start of school and
not expect to find people home.

09:13.443 --> 09:14.910
No, I think he came for
Charlie and Alison Sparks.

09:14.978 --> 09:16.078
He planned the abduction

09:16.146 --> 09:17.746
and then gained entry
to the house.

09:17.814 --> 09:19.915
But the scene is frenzied,
disorganized.

09:19.983 --> 09:22.118
He didn't think it through.

09:22.185 --> 09:24.570
I hate to say it, but
could Sammy be our unsub?

09:24.654 --> 09:25.955
I don't think so.

09:26.022 --> 09:28.457
What's the number one
motive of kidnapping?

09:28.525 --> 09:30.092
Financial gain.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.460
Yeah, well, if that's the case,

09:31.528 --> 09:33.429
they are barking up
the wrong money tree.

09:33.497 --> 09:36.081
The family runs a music store
that's been Sparks owned

09:36.166 --> 09:37.733
since the 1940s,
but business is down

09:37.801 --> 09:40.536
and a loan against the house is the
only thing keeping that store afloat.

09:40.604 --> 09:42.705
The unsub should have done
his research.

09:42.772 --> 09:44.106
Well, he may have.

09:44.174 --> 09:46.775
This area was devastated
by the oil spill.

09:46.843 --> 09:49.345
A little bit of money
would go a long way here.

10:05.362 --> 10:08.397
First impression--
this is a man on a mission.

10:08.448 --> 10:10.449
He didn't steal a single
expensive item

10:10.534 --> 10:11.934
from either one
of these rooms.

10:11.985 --> 10:14.003
He definitely
came for the parents.

10:16.823 --> 10:19.792
No sign of forced entry.

10:19.876 --> 10:21.794
The Sparks most likely
recognized him, Hotch.

10:21.878 --> 10:23.812
Unless the door was unlocked.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.315
I highly doubt that.
Look at the blood pattern.

10:26.383 --> 10:28.651
Charlie was shot as he was
moving towards the door.

10:28.718 --> 10:29.818
Well, how you figure that?

10:29.886 --> 10:31.086
Because of
the pools of blood.

10:31.137 --> 10:32.421
They're separated
by distant steps.

10:32.472 --> 10:36.091
Which means he had to be moving
quickly, so he was running.

10:36.159 --> 10:37.993
And the closer you get to the door,
the more blood there is.

10:38.061 --> 10:39.261
So he was shot right here,

10:39.329 --> 10:41.463
reached for his wound
instinctively,

10:41.531 --> 10:44.483
and then tried to grab
the piano to break his fall.

10:44.568 --> 10:47.503
See, the handprint is facing
upwards, toward the door,

10:47.571 --> 10:49.805
the same way he was facing
when he was shot.

10:49.873 --> 10:53.342
Alison was interrupted while she was
making Sammy's lunch in the kitchen.

10:53.410 --> 10:54.810
Because she heard
the doorbell ring.

10:54.861 --> 10:56.946
So she approaches the door,

10:56.997 --> 11:00.216
opens it only to find
a gun aimed at her face.

11:00.283 --> 11:01.617
So she screams.

11:01.685 --> 11:04.520
That brings Charlie
running down the stairs trying to help,

11:04.588 --> 11:06.522
but the unsub shoots Charlie
because he won't back off.

11:06.590 --> 11:08.624
Charlie's severely wounded.

11:08.692 --> 11:11.493
Why does the unsub take the time
to drag him out of the house

11:11.561 --> 11:14.096
knowing that he's leaving
a 10-year-old witness home alone?

11:14.164 --> 11:15.965
The unsub must have known
the family well enough

11:16.032 --> 11:18.734
to realize that Sammy would
never be capable of I.D.ing him.

11:28.044 --> 11:29.278
Hi, Sammy.

11:29.346 --> 11:32.181
I'm Dr. Spencer Reid.

11:32.249 --> 11:34.717
What are you drawing?

11:36.052 --> 11:37.853
Aah!

11:39.122 --> 11:40.873
Oh, God!

11:42.125 --> 11:46.262
Some autistic children
don't handle touch well.

11:49.766 --> 11:52.001
It's possible that witnessing
his parents' abduction

11:52.068 --> 11:54.136
pushed him into emotional
overload and he shut down.

11:54.204 --> 11:57.239
Look at that.

11:57.307 --> 11:59.708
Is he trying
to tell us something?

12:01.845 --> 12:03.729
Sammy.

12:03.813 --> 12:07.049
We're looking for
your mom and your dad.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.918
Did "L" take them?

12:21.364 --> 12:22.798
- Garcia...
- Yes, sir.

12:22.866 --> 12:24.116
I need you
to run a list

12:24.200 --> 12:27.636
of all known associates
to the Sparks family,

12:27.704 --> 12:30.973
focusing on everyone
whose first or last name

12:31.041 --> 12:33.542
begins with the letter "l."

12:39.049 --> 12:40.466
Well, it looks like
they were open

12:40.550 --> 12:42.968
to alternative methods
of payment.

12:43.053 --> 12:46.288
There's some construction work
for a child's drum set

12:46.356 --> 12:48.157
and cleaning services
for sheet music.

12:48.224 --> 12:51.927
Bartering must be popular
in a cash-strapped area like this.

12:51.978 --> 12:54.596
They have video surveillance,
which is good news.

12:54.664 --> 12:57.099
Do you think the unsub
was here?

12:57.167 --> 12:59.935
It's possible. These guys like to scout
their targets prior to abduction.

13:00.003 --> 13:02.538
They get off on the fact
the victims never see them coming.

13:02.605 --> 13:04.440
There's a lot they don't
teach us at the Academy.

13:04.507 --> 13:05.924
Experience handles the rest.

13:05.992 --> 13:07.876
Let's get these tapes
to Garcia.

13:10.613 --> 13:12.948
Well, the kid definitely
likes to draw,

13:12.999 --> 13:15.217
but I can't quite figure out
what it is he's drawing.

13:15.285 --> 13:18.286
That's a dog.

13:18.338 --> 13:21.957
How can you possibly know
that that looks like a dog?

13:22.025 --> 13:25.327
I don't know.
Maybe a dad knows.

13:25.395 --> 13:28.330
Well, I didn't see
a dog outside. Did you?

13:28.398 --> 13:31.617
They use these for
occupational therapy, but they're soft.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.902
Those things
are expensive, too.

13:33.970 --> 13:35.537
That's a favorite.

13:39.526 --> 13:41.476
I think we should
get this to Reid.

13:41.528 --> 13:44.246
He may be able to use it
to connect with Sammy.

13:45.498 --> 13:46.782
Look at these drawings.

13:46.833 --> 13:49.668
This must be Sammy's desk.

13:49.753 --> 13:52.154
Alison and Charlie
really went out of their way

13:52.205 --> 13:54.857
to accommodate Sammy's
condition.

13:54.924 --> 13:57.826
He must have come here
after school every day.

13:57.894 --> 13:59.261
So he was a fixture,

13:59.329 --> 14:01.597
not just in the store
but in the community.

14:01.664 --> 14:03.832
It's no wonder the Sparks
had to take out a loan.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.435
They put all of their money
into helping their son.

14:06.503 --> 14:08.570
Such dedicated parents.

14:08.638 --> 14:10.406
What happens to Sammy
if we can't find them?

14:10.473 --> 14:12.274
Garcia's searching
for relatives now.

14:12.342 --> 14:14.009
If she can't find anyone,

14:14.077 --> 14:16.211
then he will be
turned over to the state,

14:16.279 --> 14:19.348
and he'll be placed
in a special needs Foster facility.

14:19.416 --> 14:21.216
Let's make sure
that doesn't happen.

14:23.903 --> 14:26.455
We don't really have
special resources

14:26.522 --> 14:28.624
to accommodate
children like Sammy,

14:28.691 --> 14:30.959
so he's in with
everybody else.

14:31.027 --> 14:33.128
Can he comprehend
the material?

14:33.196 --> 14:34.630
Not everything.

14:34.697 --> 14:36.131
You know, I've done my best

14:36.199 --> 14:38.133
to research alternative
teaching methods,

14:38.201 --> 14:40.135
but there's only
so much I can do.

14:40.203 --> 14:42.471
Children with autism
normally think very logically.

14:42.538 --> 14:43.806
Their minds
can pick up patterns

14:43.873 --> 14:46.058
that ours normally
wouldn't recognize.

14:46.142 --> 14:49.011
Hmm. Yes, that's right.
I've found that repetition and routine

14:49.078 --> 14:50.646
are the keys to getting
through to him.

14:50.713 --> 14:52.681
You know, that makes sense. Repetition
forms patterns on the brain,

14:52.749 --> 14:56.084
and as those patterns reoccur, it forms
a calming influence on the child.

14:56.152 --> 14:58.420
Which would allow new
information to be retained.

14:58.488 --> 15:00.088
I'm sure Sammy's parents
figured that out, too.

15:00.156 --> 15:02.908
His parents most likely
kept him on a strict daily schedule.

15:02.992 --> 15:04.026
Oh, like clockwork.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.427
That's how Sammy
was able to walk

15:05.495 --> 15:07.095
from his house
to school yesterday.

15:07.163 --> 15:08.664
He'd memorized
the route.

15:08.731 --> 15:10.249
Yeah, it's 7:45,
time for him to go to school.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.750
He doesn't need to wait
for his mom or dad.

15:11.835 --> 15:14.036
He simply grabs an empty
lunchbox and heads here.

15:14.103 --> 15:16.438
If Sammy was living
on a strict routine,

15:16.506 --> 15:18.540
that means Charlie
and Alison were, too.

15:18.591 --> 15:21.877
Which would have only
made them easier targets.

15:21.928 --> 15:24.429
I'm not sure how we're
going to get through to him.

15:24.514 --> 15:27.916
Sammy's teacher says he's never even
been able to return his own mother's hug.

15:27.984 --> 15:29.268
Garcia, what have you got?

15:29.352 --> 15:30.936
On, E., I wish
I could be more help.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.889
If this is about money,
it would be a hell of a lot easier

15:33.923 --> 15:35.858
for me to give you
a list of people who wouldn't need it,

15:35.925 --> 15:38.660
and I'd probably save
a forest in the process.

15:38.728 --> 15:41.129
Due to the spill, fisherman
and fishing-related industries

15:41.197 --> 15:42.731
have been hit the worst.

15:42.782 --> 15:45.000
Sheriff, was it common knowledge that
the Sparks had gotten this loan?

15:45.068 --> 15:47.769
I knew. A loan around here
is like winning the lottery.

15:47.837 --> 15:48.837
So why no ransom note?

15:48.905 --> 15:50.639
Maybe the unsub
thinks he can get the money

15:50.707 --> 15:52.658
directly from the source,
cut out the middleman.

15:52.742 --> 15:54.142
You think he'll use
one of the parents as leverage

15:54.210 --> 15:56.044
to get the other
to clear out their accounts.

15:56.112 --> 15:59.114
He's already shot Charlie. It shouldn't
be that hard to manipulate Alison

15:59.165 --> 16:02.084
into doing what he wants if he offers
medical assistance in exchange.

16:02.151 --> 16:03.635
- I think he just did.
- What have you got?

16:03.720 --> 16:06.054
I froze the Sparks'
assets earlier today,

16:06.122 --> 16:08.623
but someone at the Bayside
Branch one parish over

16:08.675 --> 16:11.727
just managed to withdraw $10,000
from their joint savings account.

16:11.794 --> 16:13.495
Call the branch. It they're still there,
don't let them leave.

16:13.563 --> 16:15.097
Yeah.
We're probably too late.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.932
If the unsub has
what he's after,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.668
Sammy's parents
just became expendable.

16:31.998 --> 16:33.615
Well, did you get it?

16:33.666 --> 16:35.617
I couldn't get you
everything.

16:35.685 --> 16:36.652
How much you get?

16:36.719 --> 16:37.652
10,000.

16:37.704 --> 16:39.621
What? 10,000?

16:39.672 --> 16:40.956
That's not enough.

16:41.007 --> 16:43.692
I did exactly what you said.
I didn't say anything.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.527
Please, I need to
get back to Sammy.

16:45.595 --> 16:47.262
Go knows where he is
right now.

16:47.330 --> 16:48.697
I can't do that, Ali.

16:48.765 --> 16:50.682
And Charlie. Charlie's hurt.
He needs a doctor.

16:50.767 --> 16:53.635
No, what he needs
is a wife who pays better attention.

16:53.703 --> 16:54.970
I'll never tell you
where Charlie is

16:55.038 --> 16:56.638
if you don't get
my money.

16:56.689 --> 16:58.273
Shut up!
You said that if I got you--

16:58.341 --> 17:02.044
or we're gonna sit here
while Charlie bleeds to death,

17:02.111 --> 17:04.613
and you're never
gonna see Sammy again.

17:10.724 --> 17:11.992
The account was frozen.

17:12.059 --> 17:13.710
How did she take
the money out?

17:13.795 --> 17:15.212
We're on an old system.

17:15.296 --> 17:16.880
It only updates
every night at midnight.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.231
Ok. How much
did she want?

17:18.299 --> 17:20.200
Well, she wanted
to close out her account,

17:20.268 --> 17:22.969
but I told her I wouldn't
be able to give her everything today.

17:23.037 --> 17:24.337
We can't afford it.

17:24.405 --> 17:26.540
How much is everything?

17:26.607 --> 17:28.975
Um...

17:29.043 --> 17:32.679
$42,176.41.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.648
And the bank does not
have that on site?

17:34.715 --> 17:35.882
Not anymore.

17:35.950 --> 17:37.651
Mrs. Sparks isn't
the first customer

17:37.718 --> 17:39.119
to consider
closing her accounts.

17:39.187 --> 17:42.022
Could we take a look
at the security footage you have?

17:45.393 --> 17:48.879
No sign of the unsub.

17:48.963 --> 17:50.380
She doesn't look
over her shoulder.

17:50.465 --> 17:52.866
She doesn't try to warn you or anyone
else in the bank?

17:52.934 --> 17:54.668
No.

17:54.735 --> 17:55.869
What did she say to you
when you told her

17:55.937 --> 17:57.003
you couldn't give her
all the money?

17:57.071 --> 17:59.072
I told her I could
get her 10,000 now

17:59.140 --> 18:01.908
and the rest in 2 days,
but she became hysterical

18:01.976 --> 18:04.811
and kept saying
that that's not enough.

18:04.879 --> 18:06.713
Did she tell you
what the money was for?

18:06.781 --> 18:09.282
She just asked for
what she could get and she left.

18:09.350 --> 18:12.552
The unsub is probably
holding Charlie at a secondary location.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.221
Which means he might
still be alive.

18:30.304 --> 18:32.906
I have run every "L"
I can find, think of,

18:32.957 --> 18:35.208
or make up in my giant
magic head and nothing hits.

18:35.259 --> 18:37.761
I even ran the number 50
in case Sammy has

18:37.845 --> 18:40.881
some sort of predilection to Roman
numerals. Came up dry.

18:40.948 --> 18:42.916
Any luck on finding
Sammy's next of kin?

18:42.984 --> 18:45.552
In name only.
Charlie has a sister

18:45.603 --> 18:48.922
named Elizabeth
that was last reported

18:48.990 --> 18:51.775
residing in Mont Belvieu, Tejas.

18:51.859 --> 18:53.727
But she's not responding
to calls or email.

18:53.778 --> 18:55.896
Elizabeth. The "L" could
stand for Liz or Lizzie.

18:55.963 --> 18:57.464
Garcia, we need
to find her and fast.

18:57.532 --> 18:59.766
I will move so fast,
the earth will reverse its rotation

18:59.784 --> 19:02.202
and time bend backwards.
Hello.

19:02.269 --> 19:04.938
All right, so this unsub
has the money he needs.

19:05.006 --> 19:06.106
Why hasn't he let
the Sparks go?

19:06.173 --> 19:07.440
He has to be holding them
for a reason.

19:07.491 --> 19:09.042
We might have
an answer to that.

19:09.110 --> 19:12.846
Alison tried to withdraw
$40,000 from the branch in Bayside,

19:12.914 --> 19:14.314
but she only got 10,000.

19:14.382 --> 19:16.550
So maybe he's holding them until
he gets the money he needs.

19:16.617 --> 19:19.118
I think it's more than that.
I think he wants a specific amount.

19:19.170 --> 19:23.156
Alison kept telling the bank manager
that 10 grand wasn't enough.

19:23.224 --> 19:24.925
That says to me
he's told them what would be.

19:24.992 --> 19:26.826
We believe the man
you are looking for

19:26.894 --> 19:29.479
is in danger of losing
a home, property, or a business.

19:29.564 --> 19:31.147
That's most of the area.

19:31.232 --> 19:33.633
We want to focus
on residents with large families,

19:33.701 --> 19:35.168
single-income households,

19:35.236 --> 19:38.338
anyone with a financial
responsibility for others.

19:38.406 --> 19:40.974
That responsibility is probably
what drove the unsub into action.

19:41.042 --> 19:43.243
Now, he had no intention of
hurting either of his victims.

19:43.311 --> 19:45.278
For him, the abduction
of Charlie and Alison Sparks

19:45.346 --> 19:47.414
was an unfortunate but
necessary means ot an end.

19:47.481 --> 19:49.916
This area has been ravaged
by last summer's oil spill.

19:49.984 --> 19:52.752
So look for down-and-out
fishermen, look for boat owners,

19:52.820 --> 19:55.171
or anyone who used to work
in the tourist or beach industries.

19:55.256 --> 19:59.492
And compare that list to people
working part-time or under-the-table jobs.

19:59.543 --> 20:01.861
This unsub didn't start
with extortion, he was pushed there.

20:01.929 --> 20:05.732
This man feels such a
strong obligation to his dependents

20:05.800 --> 20:09.269
that he's willing to kidnap and
steal from people he knows.

20:09.337 --> 20:11.771
He may be in the process
of losing someone close to him

20:11.839 --> 20:13.073
or has already.

20:13.140 --> 20:16.209
Look at recent divorce filings,
child custody cases.

20:16.277 --> 20:18.177
The unsub went to a bank
in the next parish.

20:18.229 --> 20:20.697
That tells us he has his own mode
of transportation,

20:20.781 --> 20:23.483
and he is conscious of
the FBI's involvement in this case.

20:23.551 --> 20:26.569
By now he realizes
the Sparks' accounts are frozen,

20:26.654 --> 20:28.571
so he'll be seeking
alternative ways

20:28.656 --> 20:30.356
to get the rest
of the money he needs.

20:30.408 --> 20:31.691
So canvass banks,
pawnshops,

20:31.759 --> 20:35.161
anyplace that offers
quick cash with minimal questions.

20:35.212 --> 20:36.763
Thank you very much.

20:52.236 --> 20:54.170
Oh, he's been busy.

20:54.237 --> 20:55.171
What are those?

20:55.239 --> 20:56.506
We have no idea.

20:56.573 --> 20:58.374
We're trying to find
his aunt right now,

20:58.425 --> 20:59.876
but we're hoping that
maybe in the meantime

20:59.943 --> 21:01.410
you'd be able to help us
get through to him.

21:01.478 --> 21:03.913
Ok, I'll try, but even
before this happened,

21:03.964 --> 21:05.848
Sammy wasn't wild
about talking.

21:12.456 --> 21:13.856
What's that?

21:13.924 --> 21:16.893
These help some kids with
autism learn routines.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.595
School bus leaves at 2:15.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.431
Sammy, what's this?

21:27.704 --> 21:30.323
Ok, ok.

21:32.276 --> 21:34.293
Do you have any idea
what that "L" might stand for?

21:34.378 --> 21:36.462
I have no idea.
Sammy.

21:36.547 --> 21:38.915
Sammy, you're safe.
It's me, Ms. Rogers.

21:38.966 --> 21:42.385
I'm here. I'm here,
Sammy. You're safe.

21:42.452 --> 21:45.137
Sammy.

21:46.156 --> 21:47.823
Sammy.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.063
I've never seen that.
I don't know what it is.

21:54.131 --> 21:55.398
Is he trying to type?

21:55.465 --> 21:56.432
I don't think so.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.100
I think he's trying
to play something.

21:58.168 --> 21:59.569
Can we get
a keyboard in here?

21:59.636 --> 22:00.770
There's a piano
at his house.

22:00.837 --> 22:02.238
You want to take
a 10-year-old boy

22:02.306 --> 22:05.341
back to the crime scene
where his father was shot?

22:05.409 --> 22:06.842
Sammy's trying
to tell us something.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.844
I think it's important
we try to figure out what.

22:08.912 --> 22:12.114
Well, who decides whether
the harm to Sammy's well-being

22:12.165 --> 22:14.617
is worth whatever information
you may or may not get

22:14.668 --> 22:16.218
by doing such a thing?

22:16.286 --> 22:18.154
He's a child, and I don't
think you get to choose

22:18.221 --> 22:19.488
what's best for him.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.224
Everyone,
this is Lizzie Sparks,

22:22.292 --> 22:24.010
Sammy's aunt.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.330
Aah!
Uhh!

22:28.382 --> 22:30.016
Help!

22:31.184 --> 22:32.635
Don't do that!

22:32.686 --> 22:34.020
Aah!

22:37.173 --> 22:38.941
Are you ok?

22:39.009 --> 22:41.844
Ali, you made me
do that.

22:41.912 --> 22:44.146
I'm sorry, I didn't want to do that.
Are you all right?

22:44.214 --> 22:46.782
Why are you doing this?

22:46.850 --> 22:49.285
I ain't got a choice.
I gotta get my boys back.

22:49.353 --> 22:51.654
This can't help you
get them back.

22:51.705 --> 22:52.788
Don't say that.

22:52.856 --> 22:55.875
I got 2 more days
to prove that I'm fit.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.094
Fit? Just let me go.

22:58.161 --> 22:59.261
Please.

22:59.329 --> 23:00.930
I will.

23:02.499 --> 23:04.967
But you gotta do
something for me first.

23:08.805 --> 23:12.391
I still don't see why you have
to take him back to that place.

23:12.476 --> 23:14.744
Sammy was playing the piano
when his parents were abducted,

23:14.811 --> 23:16.612
so taking him back
to the exact location

23:16.680 --> 23:19.015
might trigger
an important response.

23:19.082 --> 23:20.950
No, but he's fragile.
It could also wound him further.

23:21.018 --> 23:22.952
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do here.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.254
You're Sammy's legal
guardian right now.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.439
The decision's yours.

23:26.523 --> 23:28.858
No. He barely knows her.

23:28.925 --> 23:30.359
Lizzie, is it?
For all we know,

23:30.410 --> 23:31.961
she's the "L"
he's afraid of.

23:32.029 --> 23:33.696
Sammy saw his aunt
and didn't even react.

23:33.764 --> 23:36.699
If she was the abductor,
we'd have seen a visceral response.

23:36.767 --> 23:38.117
You can't be sure of that.
He's in shock.

23:38.201 --> 23:40.136
We are running
a background check right now.

23:40.203 --> 23:41.804
On me?

23:41.872 --> 23:43.789
It's just procedure.

23:43.874 --> 23:45.741
But you have to decide.

23:45.809 --> 23:49.378
What do you want us to do?

23:53.884 --> 23:57.887
I'm sorry, Ali.
I never meant to hurt Charlie.

23:57.938 --> 24:00.890
Why didn't you just
ask us for the money?

24:00.957 --> 24:03.592
If you were in trouble,
we would have helped you.

24:03.643 --> 24:07.262
I couldn't, Ali.
You got Sammy and all and I...

24:07.314 --> 24:09.331
I get that.
Someday you'll get this.

24:09.399 --> 24:12.268
Please, just let us go.
I need to get back to my son.

24:12.335 --> 24:13.602
I will.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.788
But I gotta tie you up first.

24:15.872 --> 24:16.939
What?

24:17.007 --> 24:18.107
I'm gonna get my boys,

24:18.158 --> 24:19.274
I'm gonna go across
the state line,

24:19.326 --> 24:21.243
then I'll call 911
and I'll tell them

24:21.311 --> 24:24.080
where you and Charlie are
and they'll come get you, I promise you.

24:24.147 --> 24:25.915
Charlie doesn't have
that kind of time.

24:25.966 --> 24:27.249
He needs a doctor.

24:27.317 --> 24:28.851
He'll be fine,
I promise.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.126
Charlie?

24:37.177 --> 24:40.462
Charlie! Charlie? Charlie?

24:40.514 --> 24:42.498
Oh, no!

24:42.566 --> 24:43.499
Charlie.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.235
No...Charlie!

25:01.347 --> 25:05.050
Hey. So, the shop owner
gave Alison Sparks 25 grand.

25:05.118 --> 25:07.119
She wanted 30,
but the owner balked.

25:07.186 --> 25:09.221
She's got 25 from here,
10 from the bank.

25:09.288 --> 25:11.890
He's up to 35,
but he wants 40.

25:11.958 --> 25:13.592
Why is that
a special number?

25:13.659 --> 25:16.495
We should call Garcia and have
her run those numbers against the list

25:16.546 --> 25:18.230
She compiled of local
residents and foreclosures,

25:18.297 --> 25:19.998
see if anything matches up.

25:20.066 --> 25:21.800
Ok, I'll call her
right now.

25:24.220 --> 25:25.637
Seaver.

25:33.045 --> 25:34.712
Well, what do you
make of that?

25:34.764 --> 25:37.716
It looks like it was
used as a weapon.

25:37.784 --> 25:39.818
I'm betting this belongs
to our guy.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.721
You see how it's rusted
at the hook end?

25:42.789 --> 25:44.389
Give me a hint.

25:44.457 --> 25:45.924
It's an old Fisherman's trick.

25:45.992 --> 25:48.093
You can use the crowbar
to hook crab traps

25:48.161 --> 25:49.578
and shrimp catches
out at sea.

25:49.662 --> 25:51.413
It's probably pretty
common around here.

25:51.497 --> 25:54.199
Yeah, but outside the same store
Alison Sparks was last seen?

25:54.267 --> 25:56.752
Our unsub is definitely
a fisherman.

25:56.836 --> 25:58.420
We found him.

25:58.504 --> 25:59.755
Where?

25:59.839 --> 26:02.207
He's headed for D.C.
we'll meet you there.

26:02.258 --> 26:03.375
Are we sure
it's him?

26:03.426 --> 26:04.742
It's Doyle, all right.

26:04.794 --> 26:06.111
I'm looking at him
right now.

26:06.179 --> 26:08.113
He chartered a private jet.

26:08.181 --> 26:10.615
How did he get past security checks?

26:10.683 --> 26:13.552
He used an alias--
Chuck Murray.

26:13.603 --> 26:14.786
Wasn't that--

26:14.854 --> 26:16.772
Yeah. The name
of his Irish wolfhound.

26:16.856 --> 26:18.924
He's baiting us.
He wants us to know he's here.

26:18.991 --> 26:20.358
Message received.

26:20.426 --> 26:23.361
Let that bastard
come to us.

26:38.544 --> 26:41.830
When was the last
time you saw him?

26:41.948 --> 26:44.249
On his 5th birthday.

26:44.317 --> 26:46.051
5 years.

26:46.119 --> 26:49.120
Charlie and I had a fight.
It got ugly.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.823
I haven't seen
either one of them since.

26:51.891 --> 26:53.291
Do you think Charlie's
going to be ok?

26:53.359 --> 26:54.593
I'm hopeful.

26:54.660 --> 26:57.896
Sammy, would it be
all right if I sat here?

27:12.445 --> 27:16.364
Whoa. You've been
holding out on me, Sammy.

27:18.885 --> 27:21.119
I didn't know
you could play, Reid.

27:21.187 --> 27:25.323
I can't. Well, I never have before,
but it's essentially all math.

27:25.391 --> 27:30.195
Sammy, how about
you play this note...

27:31.697 --> 27:32.797
For yes...

27:32.865 --> 27:35.634
And this note...

27:35.701 --> 27:36.968
For no.

27:37.036 --> 27:40.505
Does that sound like
something you could do?

27:42.008 --> 27:43.275
Yeah, exactly.

27:43.342 --> 27:44.676
Just like that.

27:44.727 --> 27:48.113
Now, Sammy,
do you remember

27:48.181 --> 27:51.783
when the man came and
took your parents away?

28:10.136 --> 28:11.836
Sammy, I don't understand.

28:11.904 --> 28:15.473
Does this song
mean something to you?

28:52.878 --> 28:55.463
I have run "L" for Lizzie
and nothing suspicious.

28:55.548 --> 28:56.798
Her story checks out.

28:56.882 --> 28:58.416
What about local
financial records?

28:58.467 --> 29:00.986
Ah. I have cross-referenced

29:01.053 --> 29:03.471
every current and formerly
licensed fisherman,

29:03.556 --> 29:06.591
crab men, shrimp men,
friends of Poseidon, comes from the sea,

29:06.659 --> 29:07.726
you name it men

29:07.777 --> 29:10.095
with financial records
showing default loans

29:10.162 --> 29:11.429
totaling over 35k.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.764
Ok, what did you find?

29:12.815 --> 29:15.450
127 names. I know,

29:15.534 --> 29:17.285
do not shoot the messenger.

29:17.370 --> 29:19.287
Just tell me
how to narrow it down.

29:19.372 --> 29:21.773
Do all 127
have children?

29:21.841 --> 29:23.908
No, but 76 do.

29:23.976 --> 29:26.294
Ok, how many of them
have homes in foreclosure

29:26.379 --> 29:29.297
versus other debt that might
not put them out onto the streets?

29:29.382 --> 29:30.315
Mm...

29:30.383 --> 29:32.083
Oh, you are very good.

29:32.151 --> 29:34.135
We are officially
down to 24.

29:34.220 --> 29:35.453
Send us those files.

29:35.521 --> 29:38.173
At cybertastic speeds,
my sweets.

29:42.995 --> 29:45.230
Everything all right?

29:45.298 --> 29:48.466
I'm a stranger
in my own brother's house.

29:48.534 --> 29:52.637
My nephew doesn't
recognize me.

29:52.705 --> 29:54.539
And then I find this.

29:56.242 --> 29:58.476
Charlie told Sammy
about me.

29:58.544 --> 30:01.413
I always assumed that
he'd never know who I was.

30:02.882 --> 30:06.651
Do you mind my asking
what the fight was about?

30:06.719 --> 30:11.156
I was the one who suspected
Sammy had autism.

30:11.223 --> 30:12.657
Charlie didn't see it.

30:12.708 --> 30:15.293
He was so upset,
he kicked me out.

30:15.361 --> 30:17.028
How did you know?

30:17.096 --> 30:20.548
He was...different.

30:20.633 --> 30:22.534
So I did some research.

30:22.601 --> 30:24.569
Charlie was blind to it.

30:24.637 --> 30:27.672
He refused to accept
what I found.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.507
He was afraid.

30:29.575 --> 30:32.577
Any father would be,

30:32.645 --> 30:35.513
learning his child
isn't going to have it

30:35.581 --> 30:38.216
as easy as he did.

30:38.284 --> 30:41.219
You sound like you talk
from experience.

30:56.769 --> 31:00.555
Reid, take a look at this.

31:00.639 --> 31:02.206
What, at Sammy's
flip book?

31:02.258 --> 31:05.143
Not just a flip book.
His routine.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.645
Shower, brush teeth, dress.

31:07.713 --> 31:10.014
His entire life
is planned in order.

31:10.082 --> 31:12.016
Maybe we can figure out
where Sammy met the unsub.

31:12.084 --> 31:14.319
He already figured it out.

31:17.056 --> 31:19.758
Sammy sees his life
in pictures.

31:19.825 --> 31:21.659
He's been trying
to speak with us,

31:21.727 --> 31:23.661
but he only knows
how to communicate through symbols.

31:23.729 --> 31:26.281
Look, it's his language.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.267
Anchors.

31:29.335 --> 31:31.252
Like my socks.

31:32.738 --> 31:36.207
And that's the tread
on your shoes.

31:36.258 --> 31:39.077
What does the "L" mean?

31:39.145 --> 31:40.411
It's not an "L."

31:40.463 --> 31:41.980
It's a time.

31:42.047 --> 31:44.115
3:00. The time Sammy
wants us to know about,

31:44.183 --> 31:45.750
the time that he met
the unsub.

31:45.818 --> 31:47.302
Where was he at 3:00?

31:47.386 --> 31:49.721
2:30, music store.

31:49.789 --> 31:52.457
He goes there every day
after school,

31:52.525 --> 31:55.276
and he doesn't leave
until the store closes at 6:00.

31:55.361 --> 31:57.595
Hey, Sammy. Sammy,
it's almost 3:00.

31:57.663 --> 32:00.999
Is there someplace
you should be?

32:01.066 --> 32:03.668
Should be store.

32:11.544 --> 32:13.661
No, no, let him go.

32:15.164 --> 32:19.134
Hotch, I think
we've got something.

32:25.791 --> 32:28.393
Morgan, we need
to fast-forward to 3 p.m.

32:28.460 --> 32:31.696
If I'm right, the unsub
is somewhere on this tape.

32:35.184 --> 32:38.770
Reid, here's when Sammy
gets to the store.

32:38.838 --> 32:40.905
They changed the music.
Why would they do that?

32:40.973 --> 32:42.507
It's for Sammy.

32:42.575 --> 32:46.310
Classical might be more
comforting than Hard Rock.

32:46.362 --> 32:48.513
Ok, here's 3:00.

32:59.191 --> 33:00.959
That's the song.

33:01.010 --> 33:04.462
Sammy's been trying to tell us
who took his parents all along.

33:04.530 --> 33:07.966
At 3 p.m. the song plays,
the same song every day at the same time

33:08.033 --> 33:10.101
because Charlie Sparks
puts the CD in at 2:30

33:10.169 --> 33:12.103
when Sammy arrives.
Sammy's never late

33:12.171 --> 33:14.439
because Sammy
sticks to a schedule, a routine.

33:14.506 --> 33:16.340
30 minutes later...

33:16.392 --> 33:17.842
This man arrives.

33:17.893 --> 33:20.078
A deliveryman with
a routine all of his own.

33:20.145 --> 33:22.981
We need to figure out
who that is, because he's our unsub.

33:31.764 --> 33:33.865
Former fisherman turned
part-time deliveryman,

33:33.894 --> 33:36.796
saddled with more debt than he and
his recently removed sons could sustain,

33:36.864 --> 33:39.465
including a foreclosing house
and a defaulted boat loan.

33:39.533 --> 33:41.367
Why didn't you tell me
you were looking for Bill Thomas

33:41.418 --> 33:43.035
at 1024 Elmwood Avenue?

33:43.103 --> 33:44.087
What about his boat?

33:44.171 --> 33:46.071
Docked in the marina.

33:46.123 --> 33:47.640
We're closer
to the house.

33:47.708 --> 33:49.759
Ok, we'll take the boat.
Let's go.

34:03.089 --> 34:04.090
FBI!

34:16.069 --> 34:17.870
Morgan, he's not here.

34:17.938 --> 34:19.322
I know, Hotch.
We got him.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.043
Bill Thomas!

34:25.112 --> 34:27.112
This is the FBI!

34:27.164 --> 34:29.632
Give yourself up!
Your boat is surrounded!

34:29.716 --> 34:33.386
We don't want anyone else
to get hurt, Bill.

34:33.454 --> 34:36.922
Turn yourself in!

34:42.896 --> 34:43.929
All right, listen up.

34:43.981 --> 34:46.264
We move in as soon as
SWAT is in position.

34:46.315 --> 34:47.900
What's going on in there?

34:51.188 --> 34:53.539
Are you gonna respond?

34:53.607 --> 34:55.475
I had it, Ali.

34:55.542 --> 34:57.343
A dream.

34:58.545 --> 34:59.946
Not a big one.

34:59.997 --> 35:02.548
It was my dream.

35:02.616 --> 35:04.150
I put food on the table.

35:04.218 --> 35:06.886
I had a family.

35:06.954 --> 35:10.189
They loved me.

35:10.257 --> 35:12.875
He was my dream.

35:22.686 --> 35:24.971
Here.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.139
Take this.

35:27.191 --> 35:28.574
What are you doing?

35:28.642 --> 35:32.111
I can't take care
of my boys if I go to jail.

35:38.585 --> 35:40.520
Bill, I can't.

35:40.587 --> 35:44.123
If I do it myself, they won't get my
life insurance policy.

35:44.191 --> 35:45.958
Just do it.

35:54.084 --> 35:55.885
No.

35:55.969 --> 35:57.970
I'm not like you.

35:58.038 --> 36:01.474
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

36:01.542 --> 36:03.142
You will, damn it.

36:03.209 --> 36:07.063
You will do it.
Look at all I took away from you.

36:07.147 --> 36:09.248
Charlie, he's gone.
He ain't never comin' back.

36:09.316 --> 36:10.983
You understand that?

36:11.051 --> 36:14.520
You're gonna be alone
at Sammy's graduation.

36:14.588 --> 36:16.822
He's never gonna hear
the voice of his father

36:16.890 --> 36:19.892
or even remember what it sounds like.
Stop.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.661
Charlie's not gonna
read to you in bed.

36:21.728 --> 36:23.195
He told me he did that,
didn't he?

36:23.263 --> 36:24.864
He's not gonna kiss you.

36:24.915 --> 36:25.998
Stop.

36:26.066 --> 36:27.900
You're never gonna feel
his touch again.

36:27.951 --> 36:29.919
You're gonna grow old
alone, Ali.

36:30.003 --> 36:32.788
Alone.

36:35.542 --> 36:37.710
Your dream's over.

36:42.182 --> 36:44.267
Move in!

37:07.824 --> 37:11.177
Ma'am.
Ma'am, are you hurt?

40:03.416 --> 40:06.018
I knew you were
watching me.

40:06.086 --> 40:07.653
What's the expression?

40:07.721 --> 40:12.341
Keeps your friends close,
your enemies under surveillance?

40:12.425 --> 40:14.143
I've been here
for 2 hours.

40:14.227 --> 40:17.196
You should know better than
to keep a lady waiting.

40:17.264 --> 40:19.365
It seems hypocritical,

40:19.432 --> 40:21.801
seeing as I had to wait
7 years.

40:31.878 --> 40:33.212
Hello, Ian.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.880
Hello, Lauren.

40:34.948 --> 40:39.652
Oh, wait. Lauren Reynolds
died in a car accident, didn't she?

40:39.719 --> 40:41.821
What do you want?

40:41.888 --> 40:44.256
You.

40:44.324 --> 40:46.959
Oh, not today.
Don't worry about that.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.961
But soon.

40:51.231 --> 40:54.834
I've got a Glock
leveled at your crotch.

40:54.901 --> 40:56.335
What's to stop me
from taking you

40:56.403 --> 40:58.704
and the little ones
out right now?

40:58.772 --> 41:01.273
You'd never make it back to your car
and you know it.

41:01.341 --> 41:05.177
Tell me,
does the lovely Penelope

41:05.245 --> 41:06.512
know the truth about you?

41:06.580 --> 41:10.916
Or is she too busy watching
movies with Derek to care?

41:10.984 --> 41:14.186
Here you are, all alone,

41:14.254 --> 41:17.289
while Aaron sits at home
with his son.

41:17.357 --> 41:20.426
And why didn't Dave and Ashley
invite you to their game night?

41:20.493 --> 41:25.264
Maybe they thought you'd be
on the Metro with Dr. Reid.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.401
Oh, that one does have
some quirks.

41:29.469 --> 41:33.138
Come near my team
and I will end you.

41:33.206 --> 41:35.774
I don't have a quarrel
with them.

41:35.842 --> 41:38.344
How long that remains
the case

41:38.411 --> 41:41.814
depends entirely on you.

41:41.882 --> 41:43.649
They're innocent.

41:43.717 --> 41:44.984
You are not.

41:45.051 --> 41:46.819
I was doing my job.

41:46.887 --> 41:49.788
I think you did
a little more than that.

41:49.856 --> 41:52.858
You took the only thing
that mattered to me.

41:52.926 --> 41:56.795
So I'm going to take the only thing
that matters to you.

41:56.863 --> 41:58.831
Your life.

42:04.671 --> 42:07.506
Honore de Balzac once said,

42:07.574 --> 42:12.011
"most people of action
are inclined to fatalism,

42:12.078 --> 42:15.080
and most of thought
believe in Providence."

42:17.284 --> 42:21.453
Tell me, Emily Prentiss,

42:21.521 --> 42:25.024
which do you think
you're going to be?
