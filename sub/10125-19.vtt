AND GRAB A BURGER.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.834
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

09:37.834 --> 09:41.200
LET'S GO TO THE ZOO
AND SEE THE GIRAFFES.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.934
WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO
A THING LIKE THAT, HUH?

09:56.500 --> 09:59.200
I KNOW YOU
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.467
I TOLD YOU.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.834
QUIT CALLING ME TOPANGA.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.500

LAUNCHED A SATELLITE.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.900
OHH! OHH!

10:18.900 --> 10:22.400
OUR GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT

10:22.400 --> 10:24.100
WITH AN ATOMIC WARHEAD.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.967

10:37.100 --> 10:39.200
IT'S NOT A BOMB
OR FOR SPYING.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.100
THE RUSSIANS
ARE DOING SPACE TRAVEL
EXPERIMENTS.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.200
ARE THEY?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.033
YEAH. AND THIS ARMS RACE
THING, TRUST ME.

10:45.033 --> 10:48.033

TAKE A HARVARD GENIUS

10:59.033 --> 11:00.667

11:00.667 --> 11:03.467

11:13.033 --> 11:14.900

HAVE GOTTEN FAR.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.100
ALL CLEAR.

11:21.767 --> 11:24.500
THAT WAS RIGHT THERE.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
PERFECT AIM.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.567
WE GOT TO SCRAM

11:26.567 --> 11:28.834
BEFORE THAT BUNCH
COMES BACK.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.600
YEAH, BUT
THEY'LL RECOGNIZE ME.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.100
IN THIS CLEVER
DISGUISE THEY WON'T.

11:37.867 --> 11:41.200
SO WHY'D YOU

FOR YOU AND OTHER
RUSSIAN SPIES?

11:49.567 --> 11:51.800
I'M NOT A RUSSIAN SPY.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.834
HEY, WHATEVER.

11:52.834 --> 11:55.400
FRIENDS DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN NOTHING.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.600
I THOUGHT YOU
DIDN'T HAVE FRIENDS.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.300
I DIDN'T.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.734
NOW I DO.

12:02.734 --> 12:03.700
SO...

12:03.700 --> 12:06.700
T.L., I GUESS
THIS IS GOODBYE, HUH?

12:06.700 --> 12:10.934
I THOUGHT I
TOLD YOU NOT TO LOOK
AT ME LIKE THAT.

12:10.934 --> 12:13.600
SORRY. I JUST
CAN'T HELP IT.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.567
[BARKING]

12:14.567 --> 12:17.767
COME ON, YOU CAN
FIND ONE RUSSIAN SPY!

12:17.767 --> 12:19.600
YOU'RE HARVARD-TRAINED DOGS.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.567

GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.400
UH-UH-UH! MOM SAID

12:27.400 --> 12:31.100
NO ONE CAN TOUCH
THOSE BROWNIES
TILL AFTER DINNER.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.600
MORGAN, WHERE'S
MOM AND DAD?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.867
MOM'S OUT,
BUT DAD'S UPSTAIRS.

12:34.867 --> 12:38.100
HEY, KIDS!

12:38.100 --> 12:39.100

YOUR ALLOWANCE.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.967
BUT I'M

THEN GIVE ME BACK MY DIME.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.133
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

12:48.133 --> 12:50.300
I BET THAT'S MY DAD.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.300

12:54.700 --> 12:58.000
NO. ANSON WILLIAMS,
LIKE I SAID I WAS,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.066
NOT WHO YOU THINK I WAS.

13:00.066 --> 13:02.500
JUST DROP IT, ALL RIGHT?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.700
JUST CALM DOWN,
YOUNG FELLA,

13:05.700 --> 13:08.133
AND HAVE
A NICE BROWNIE, HUH?

13:08.133 --> 13:09.934
OH, THANKS, MR. B.

13:09.934 --> 13:11.834
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, SON?

13:11.834 --> 13:14.300
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU LOST SOMETHING.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.200
I HAVE.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.667
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.400
I CAN CHEER YOU UP.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.700
YOU KNOW, WHEN I
WAS DOWN IN THE DUMPS,

13:22.700 --> 13:24.233
MY PARENTS USED TO SAY--

13:24.233 --> 13:26.033
COME TO THINK OF IT,

13:26.033 --> 13:27.667
I DIDN'T
HAVE ANY PARENTS,

13:27.667 --> 13:28.900
NOT EVEN A HOUSE.

13:28.900 --> 13:32.100
I HUNG OUT AT OTHER
PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.834
NOT BAD, REALLY.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.567
OH, DADDY DEAREST?

14:11.867 --> 14:13.834
BUT UNTIL
THEY HAUL HIM OFF,

14:13.834 --> 14:16.600

WELL, I KNOW YOU'VE
GOT TO GO BACK,

19:11.100 --> 19:15.867
BUT, UH, I SURE HATE
TO LOSE A FRIEND
LIKE YOU.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.700
YOU WON'T.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.500
I MEAN, I THINK WE COULD BE
FRIENDS JUST ABOUT ANY TIME.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.700
SO...

19:23.700 --> 19:26.900
GUESS THIS IS
REALLY GOODBYE, HUH?

19:26.900 --> 19:28.367
YEAH, I THINK SO.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.667
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU STAYED,

19:30.667 --> 19:33.700
I COULD REALLY MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.400
COULD YOU HOLD THAT THOUGHT
FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS?

19:38.367 --> 19:42.200
AH, HECK,
YOU'LL NEVER FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS ANYWAY.

19:46.700 --> 19:50.100
O.K., I GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.767
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:51.767 --> 19:52.767
IT'S 1957!

19:52.767 --> 19:54.767
THERE IS NO MICROWAVE!

19:54.767 --> 19:56.000
OOPSY!

19:56.000 --> 19:58.367
WHAT KIND OF WISE MAN
SAYS, "OOPSY"?

19:58.367 --> 20:01.100
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY,

20:01.100 --> 20:03.834
"WAX ON, WAX OFF"?

20:03.834 --> 20:04.900
[BLOWS WHISTLE]

20:04.900 --> 20:06.000
THERE HE IS!

20:06.000 --> 20:07.700
ANOTHER A-PLUS,
MR. MATTHEWS!

20:07.700 --> 20:09.133
SPY!
SPY!

20:09.133 --> 20:10.500
NO. I'M CORY.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.834
SPY! SPY!
I'M CORY!

20:11.834 --> 20:14.734
SPY!
SPY!
I'M CORY!

20:14.734 --> 20:16.834
SPY! SPY!
SPY! SPY!

20:16.834 --> 20:21.867
CORY? CORY?

20:21.867 --> 20:24.133
CORY, HONEY,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:24.133 --> 20:25.667
I'M NOT BRAD PITT.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.400
I'M NOT BRAD PITT!

20:27.400 --> 20:29.467
WELL, DUH!

20:29.467 --> 20:30.867
EASY. EASY, PAL.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.400
YOU HAD QUITE
A JOLT THERE.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.867
YOU WERE OUT COLD.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.667
SHAWNZY?

20:36.667 --> 20:38.100
YES-ZY?

20:38.100 --> 20:41.567
YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE
FOR ME, AREN'T YOU?

20:41.567 --> 20:43.000
HEY.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.700
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR, COR?

20:46.700 --> 20:47.600
SHE'S HERE.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.000
I KNOW SHE'S HERE.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.700
HEY, I GOT YOU
SOME MORE ICE.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.400
YOU O.K.?

20:55.400 --> 20:57.300
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

20:57.300 --> 21:01.300
I WILL ALWAYS LOOK
AT YOU LIKE THIS.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.300
WELL, STOP.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.567
WHY?

21:04.567 --> 21:07.100
BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING ME
THE HEEBIE-JEEBIES.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.500
GOOD.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.033
ERIC, I'M ALMOST DONE

21:18.033 --> 21:19.734
WITH MY TERM PAPER
ON THE SPACE PROGRAM.

21:19.734 --> 21:21.900
YOU'LL BE ALL DONE
IF YOU DON'T PLUG THAT IN.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.400
THE BATTERIES
ARE LOW, MAN.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.934
ERIC, ERIC, THANK YOU.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.700
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

21:33.967 --> 21:35.800
UH-OH. NOT AGAIN.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.400
WHERE AM I?

21:37.400 --> 21:38.800
CORY, ARE YOU O.K.?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.467
YEAH. STILL HERE.

21:40.467 --> 21:44.367
GOOD. WELL, LET'S,
UH, KEEP IT THAT WAY.

21:44.367 --> 21:45.367
THEY KNOW ME.

21:45.367 --> 21:46.367
NO FOREIGN ACCENTS.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.800
EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE A-O.K.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.567
MR. MATTHEWS...

21:54.467 --> 21:56.467
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE IN MY KITCHEN,

21:56.467 --> 21:58.734
DRESSED IN A SPACE SUIT.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.867
BRIDGE,
CAPTAIN FEENY HERE.

22:02.867 --> 22:05.467
I HAVE LOCATED
THE EARTH ALIEN.

22:05.467 --> 22:08.900
I WILL ESCORT HIM BACK
TO THE MOTHER SHIP.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.800
MR. FEENY,
EARTH ALIEN? I'M--

22:10.800 --> 22:12.800
BEAM US UP!

22:12.800 --> 22:14.100
SURE.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.567
GO AHEAD.
