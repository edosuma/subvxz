19:52.067 --> 19:55.570
I-I can't do drugs anymore.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.821
I got nothing.

20:00.325 --> 20:01.659
I don't know.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.953
Sometimes I think it's over,
you know?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.248
I don't--

20:07.290 --> 20:09.334
I don't think anybody
really knows

20:09.376 --> 20:11.294
what they're doing, right?

20:11.336 --> 20:13.672
I mean,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.299
I don't have
as much experience as you,

20:16.341 --> 20:18.176
but I don't know.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.096
When I was 18,
I thought when I'm 21,

20:21.137 --> 20:22.764
I'll have it all
figured out, right?

20:22.806 --> 20:25.809
And then 21 came,
and I was like,

20:25.850 --> 20:28.186
I don't know, maybe 25?
Maybe 25?

20:28.228 --> 20:31.648
And then 25 came,
and I was like, maybe 29?

20:31.690 --> 20:33.858
And now I'm 29,
and I'm like, 33?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.902
You know, like,

20:35.944 --> 20:38.029
I-I don't think anybody knows
what they're doing.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.280
And I think that's okay, though.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.949
I think it's--
I think it's fine.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.410
I think we're all
just trying our best, but...

20:45.537 --> 20:49.582
Hey, I did win Sexiest Man of
the Year, Staten Island, 1992.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.710
I know.
It was a really tight race.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.003
And all the odds
were against you,

20:53.044 --> 20:55.005
but you beat out
Paul Montello and Kyle Hennesy.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.048
- Fucking right, I did.
- Yeah.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.092
- Can't take that away from me.
- No, they can't.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.260
I mean,
literally they can't.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.928
I got the trophy
still in the garage.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.514
- I've seen it.
- All right.

21:04.556 --> 21:07.017
All right.
Best day ever.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.727
- Right?
- Yeah.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.395
All right.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.148
- Killer fucking mega truck.
- [chuckles]

21:13.189 --> 21:15.025
Oh, shit.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.694
- Hey, Uncle Tommy.
- Big drop. What?

21:17.736 --> 21:20.196
Do as I say,
not as I do.

21:22.657 --> 21:26.202
I'm gonna go piss
on my house now.
