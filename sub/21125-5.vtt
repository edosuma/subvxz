00:06.507 --> 00:06.640
.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.776
- I found it.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.212
What about this tweed jammer
for the doctor's appointment?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.181
Very Jackie O?
- It's too formal.

00:14.282 --> 00:14.548
- You know, she had cancer.
I Googled it last night.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.184
- Stop Googling.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.052
I'm gonna put a parent lock
on your computer.

00:18.919 --> 00:19.653
- Why don't you put
a lock on this?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.390
Hey, does this make you
wanna cure my cancer?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.225
- Go back in there,
Arsenio Hall.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.659
- Hold on then a second.
Does this change things?

00:25.759 --> 00:28.229
If I were just to throw
this on casually?

00:28.329 --> 00:30.331
- Who throws on
a beret casually?

00:30.431 --> 00:32.166
- Okay.
- Hey, why are we obsessing

00:32.266 --> 00:34.235
about what we're gonna wear?
- If she likes me,

00:34.335 --> 00:36.537
maybe she's gonna work harder
to get the cancer out of me.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.439
- That's not how it works.
- It is how it works.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.209
- Okay, this oncologist
is no joke.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.610
She was on "Oprah."

00:42.710 --> 00:44.412
- She was on "Oprah"?
- That's right.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.080
This is Dr. Leslie Rollins.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.681
She is legit
the best of the best.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.550
- Well, that puts even more
pressure on what I'm gonna wear.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.352
You know what,
let's stop by T.J. Maxx,

00:51.452 --> 00:53.421
get a couple more options, okay?
- Hey, hey, hey--

00:53.521 --> 00:55.423
- Maggie, I need
an Oprah-level blazer.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.692
All I've got in here is, like,
Steve Harvey at best,

00:58.792 --> 01:01.295
maybe Ricki Lake.
- Come here.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.164
- I don't know
why you don't understand.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.498
- I do understand.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.167
Are we losing our mind
a little bit?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.535
- Little bit.
- Listen to me.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.337
We got this.
- Are you sure?

01:09.437 --> 01:12.273
- I don't know if you've seen,
uh, my binder.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.475
What?
- What is that?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.178
- I made you a little binder,
baby girl.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.413
"Cancer,
you wanna roll with this?"

01:19.513 --> 01:21.549
- [chuckles]
When did you go to Paper Source?

01:21.649 --> 01:23.451
- Last night while you were
sleeping. Don't worry about it.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.453
There's one in Rhode Island
that's open till 10:00.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.821
It's got personalized tabs
for appointments or research,

01:27.921 --> 01:30.824
or if you wanted to put various
pamphlets in, or take notes.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.328
Look at this pen.
I spent $78 on this pen alone.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.730
Cancer ain't got nothing
on these tabs.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.167
- Okay.
[exhales]

01:39.267 --> 01:41.869
I just need to figure out
what candle to give her.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.504
- Oh, my God,
you got her a gift?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.373
That's weird!
- A-B-B-G,

01:45.473 --> 01:46.640
Always Be Bringing Gifts.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.176
- Okay, that's not the phrase.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.743
- Okay, so we've got
Scent of Papaya...

01:49.843 --> 01:51.412
- What?
- Whispering Grass,

01:51.512 --> 01:54.215
and my personal favorite,
Papa's Leather.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.784
- Definitely not Papa's Leather.
- Why not?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.886
- 'Cause nobody wants to
smell that.

01:58.986 --> 02:03.491
- * Hey, remember when

02:03.591 --> 02:06.794
* All of time stood still?

02:06.894 --> 02:08.762
* Doo-doo, doo-doo

02:08.862 --> 02:11.199
**

02:11.299 --> 02:14.568
* Back before we were brittle

02:14.668 --> 02:18.272
* Back before we were brittle

02:19.573 --> 02:21.375
- What do you need?
Do you need something?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.411
- I just kinda feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.513
- Okay, I have gingy;
I have cashews.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.715
Maybe you need to eat something?
- No, I think I'm okay.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.550
[knocking on the door]

02:29.650 --> 02:32.353
- What's happening in here?
There's cancer in those boobs?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.822
That's a horrible inconvenience.
Let's get that out.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.524
- [laughs]
- I'm Dr. Rollins.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.626
You must be Emma.
- I am, I am.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.328
- I'm Maggie,
her, uh, best friend.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.230
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.432
- Sorry, I don't mean to be
crying so soon.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.733
- No, no, you--no,
let the tears flow.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.268
This is a safe place.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.736
This is a little
overwhelming, isn't it?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.839
- I was gonna wear a beret,
and then Maggie said no.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.274
- No beret.
- Oh. [chuckles]

02:53.374 --> 02:54.442
- She's doing good,
though, right?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.377
- Yeah, she is.
- Yeah.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.811
- I'ma tell you one thing.
You're in the best hands,

02:57.911 --> 02:59.680
because I've been doing this
for freaking ever.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.182
And the even better news is
you found the lump,

03:02.283 --> 03:03.784
so now we get to do
something about it,

03:03.884 --> 03:04.952
all right?
- Okay.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.520
- I'm gonna tell you
what I know.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.422
If I talk too fast,
you let me know.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.292
So it looks like the tumor
is only about two centimeters.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.660
It does mean
we have to do surgery.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.927
- Oh.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.195
- But we have
a couple of options.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.497
We can do a lumpectomy,

03:16.597 --> 03:18.532
which means I take
just the lump,

03:18.632 --> 03:20.200
leave the rest of the breast,
or we do a double mastectomy,

03:20.301 --> 03:21.802
meaning we take
both the breasts.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.972
- Okay, um, well, what's gonna
keep me the most alive?

03:25.072 --> 03:26.574
- Well...
- 'Cause I have a, um--

03:26.674 --> 03:27.841
I have a one-year-old daughter,
and--

03:27.941 --> 03:29.677
I mean, she's not my daughter...

03:29.777 --> 03:31.211
- Yeah, she is.
- She's Maggie's baby,

03:31.312 --> 03:33.281
but I have to just...

03:33.381 --> 03:36.517
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I just wanna, um--

03:36.617 --> 03:39.687
I need to make sure
that I'm here for her.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.555
Do you understand?
- Yes, got it.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.758
Research shows that
a lumpectomy plus radiation

03:44.858 --> 03:47.695
is just as effective
as a double mastectomy.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.797
- But what would you do
if you were me?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.365
- Every case is different,

03:51.465 --> 03:53.734
but with these results,
and your age,

03:53.834 --> 03:55.736
and the fact that you have
a toddler at home,

03:55.836 --> 03:57.605
I would have those boobs
off me so fast,

03:57.705 --> 03:59.407
my head would spin.
- Then take them off.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.741
- You don't wanna
think about it?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.676
- No, tomorrow, do 'em.
- You heard her.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.412
Let's take 'em off.
- Take 'em off.

04:04.512 --> 04:05.746
- You girls mean business.
both: Yeah.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.481
- I don't know if you've seen
this binder,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.016
but it says, "Cancer,
you wanna roll with this?"

04:09.116 --> 04:10.884
- I like you two a lot.
- We like you.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.820
- We like everything about you.
- I've thrown a lot at you.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.722
You have questions?
- Maggie, what else do we have?

04:14.822 --> 04:16.957
- I had all these questions,
but she answered most of them.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.627
- All right, you know what,
forget--here, this is my cell.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.796
All right? Call me day or night,
anytime, any questions.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.865
And no Googling.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.600
I'm the Google.
- Okay.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.801
- Can you say that
one more time?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.002
- No, okay, I get it.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.638
- She's your Google.
No Googling.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.307
- Um, I just have
one more question.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.642
- Yeah?

04:34.742 --> 04:36.410
- Uh, do you think
I'm gonna kick it?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.712
- Kick it?
- She means kick it, like die.

04:38.812 --> 04:42.383
- Um, I think you're gonna
kick cancer's ass.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.017
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.653
- You're gonna be there
to dance at Charlotte's wedding.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.287
- You think so?
- Yes...

04:47.388 --> 04:48.856
not--not that she has to
get married.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.924
We're not gonna force
those kinda decisions on her.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.526
- [laughs] Okay.
- Give me a hug.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.761
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.463
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.930
- I'm so glad we found you.
- Good.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.866
- Hey, FYI, you might to get to
keep your nips, right?

04:58.966 --> 05:01.369
- That's correct. I do a special
nipple sparing surgery.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.603
- Excuse me?
- I do.

05:02.703 --> 05:03.804
- She's really proud
of her nipples.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.539
- Oh, my God--well...

05:05.639 --> 05:07.475
they're just the perfect ratio
of areola to nipple.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.744
- Oh, well in that case,
let's go see Dr. Meredith,

05:10.844 --> 05:13.547
to pick out the perfect boobs
for the perfect nips.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.717
[gentle guitar music]

05:16.817 --> 05:19.620
*

05:19.720 --> 05:21.355
- Yeah, they're really
not much to speak of.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.656
- What? They're wonderful,

05:22.756 --> 05:25.325
except for the cancer.
- [laughs]

05:25.426 --> 05:26.627
- By the time
I'm done with them,

05:26.727 --> 05:27.928
you're gonna have to
sell tickets...

05:28.028 --> 05:29.530
- Okay. [laughs]
- Okay?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.098
- She's gonna give you
the boobs of your dreams.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.800
- I really like
the sound of that.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.369
- Okay, good, 'cause what
Dr. Rollins and I do--

05:35.469 --> 05:36.970
it's called a one-step
reconstruction.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.840
So she's gonna scoop out
all of the breast tissue,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.442
and then right away,

05:41.542 --> 05:43.444
I'm just gonna put in
your brand new implants.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.845
- I'm the scooper,
she's the boober.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.647
It's like Cold Stone Creamery.
- [laughs]

05:46.747 --> 05:49.417
- Okay, let's put our fingers
on some boobies.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.519
- This is a--[laughs]--
it's a suitcase of boobs.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.686
That's so weird.
- Yeah.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.655
- Okay.
- All right...

05:54.755 --> 05:57.891
which one of these
feels most like your boobs?

05:57.991 --> 06:01.562
- Um, okay, uh...

06:03.631 --> 06:05.399
I don't know.
- Really get in there.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.767
Just really feel it.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.135
- I don't really touch
my boobs that much,

06:08.235 --> 06:09.803
so I don't really know.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.872
- Want me to give it a shot?
- Please.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.474
- Kay.

06:15.509 --> 06:19.379
Excuse me.
Okay.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.882
Kay.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.752
Hm...

06:26.053 --> 06:27.621
Mm-mm.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.390
It's number two.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.759
- Number two it is.
- Drop the mic.

06:31.859 --> 06:32.893
- [laughs]
- It's number two!

06:32.993 --> 06:33.894
- All right.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.429
*

06:35.529 --> 06:36.964
- So look, I took the liberty of

06:37.064 --> 06:38.899
putting together
a--a to-go bag here for ya.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.734
- What? For the hospital?
- Yeah.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.703
- I'm not bringing
this smelly bag to the hospital.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.738
- Emma, I Febrezed it.
- You Febrezed it?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.173
- I Febrezed the whole thing.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.641
- I don't know
where this has been,

06:47.741 --> 06:48.909
and I don't wanna be
a part of it.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.511
- Smell it.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.645
Right?
- Yeah, that's nice.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.146
- Lilac.
Lilac and lavender.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.782
- What is in here?
- I got--

06:54.882 --> 06:56.684
this has got necessities
and, like, comfort items.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.519
- Comfort items?
- Yeah...

06:58.619 --> 06:59.820
- What is this?
- Like, I--some tube socks,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.021
three for a dollar.
- Oh, please,

07:01.121 --> 07:02.490
Don't go all out for me.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.724
- I just wanted to
keep your feet warm.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.593
I also wanted to
protect the doctors

07:05.693 --> 07:07.094
from your sharp toes, 'cause
they're not ready for that.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.796
They don't know that's coming.
- Okay, okay.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.664
- I just don't want anybody
down there,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.432
for some reason to say,
"I'm checking a staff--oh! My--

07:12.533 --> 07:14.167
Oh, my veins, squirt,
squirt, squirt," you know.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.669
[both laugh]

07:15.769 --> 07:17.070
I just don't want anybody
getting cut.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.907
- Wow, okay.
- In the necessity category,

07:20.007 --> 07:21.775
I had to bring it back to
the old school.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.878
- [gasps] Oh, my God,
one of your classic mixes.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.113
- DJ Mark, 99.7.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.948
* The Crush

07:28.048 --> 07:30.484
- What am I gonna play this on?
- Shabwams.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.620
- What is this?
A Walkman?

07:32.720 --> 07:35.956
- Yeah, yeah.
- Is this from evidence?

07:36.056 --> 07:38.225
- It's from evidence.
But the socks are fresh,

07:38.325 --> 07:39.827
as our the jams...
- Yeah, here.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.695
- So you got that,
and then of course--

07:41.795 --> 07:43.731
let me see--we got the, uh--
my policeman sweatshirt,

07:43.831 --> 07:46.600
which you've been bogarting
anyways, so there you go.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.603
All right, so, uh,
I will be by tomorrow

07:49.703 --> 07:52.640
to pick you guys up at 6:15 a.m.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.841
And, um...
- You know what--

07:53.941 --> 07:55.709
- Oh, do you want
a police escort?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.944
'Cause I can do--I can get the--
[imitates sirens]...

07:57.044 --> 07:58.712
- No, you know what--
- Up top.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.914
- No, I actually, um--
[clears throat]--

08:01.014 --> 08:02.583
I think that, uh,

08:02.683 --> 08:06.053
I can't have you there tomorrow.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.889
- Oh.
Okay.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.724
- 'Cause I was thinking
about it, and I--

08:10.824 --> 08:12.693
I really need to
just be strong, you know,

08:12.793 --> 08:16.830
and just, like, get it done,
and I'm afraid if I see you...

08:18.766 --> 08:20.801
That I'm gonna cry,
and I don't wanna--

08:20.901 --> 08:23.571
I don't wanna do that tomorrow.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.938
- Absolutely.
- Is that okay?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.540
- Absolutely, honey,
whatever you need.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.208
- Okay.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.544
- Whatever you need.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.646
Yeah. Hey...

08:39.052 --> 08:39.186
.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.989
- How are you feeling?
Are you cold?

08:43.123 --> 08:43.156
- Yeah, I could use another one
of those warm blankets.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.825
- Yes, ma'am.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.594
I'm gonna do
a special nurse trick.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.295
- Ooh.
- Do my burrito feet wrap.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.297
- Ooh, I like seeing you do
your work, girl.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.666
- [giggles]

08:52.766 --> 08:54.602
- Where my girls at?
[both laugh]

08:54.702 --> 08:56.169
- All right, you excited
to meet your new boobs?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.205
That's exciting.
- I am.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.306
- First thing's first,
all right.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.941
Settle this for us.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.843
What kind music should we play
during the surgery?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.845
You're not gonna hear it,
but we usually do Cyndi Lauper.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.614
She's really going through
a real Pat Benatar phase

09:06.714 --> 09:07.981
right now.
- Yeah, I want Fleetwood Mac.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.717
- Oh, okay, you wanna do
the sexy witch thing?

09:09.817 --> 09:11.184
- I'm on board for that.
- Okay.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.186
- How are you feeling, honey?
- I feel okay.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.655
- The anesthesiologist
just left,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.056
and he said it would take
a little while

09:16.156 --> 09:17.290
for the drugs to kick in.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.892
- You wanna pop up?
- Sure.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.327
- I'm just mark up
your breasts real quick here.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.329
- [clears throat]
- Your gown.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.897
- How long is the surgery
gonna last?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.799
- It's gonna be
about four hours.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.935
- Oh, four. That's, uh,
longer than I had thought.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.603
- Do you guys stop for snacks?

09:29.703 --> 09:30.938
Ma-Maggie, did you bring
snacks for them?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.005
- I didn't.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.807
I could run out
and grab something.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.342
What do you guys like?
- No, no, that's okay.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.210
I'm good.
I brought something from home.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.780
I like to have a turkey hoagie
right in the middle of surgery,

09:39.880 --> 09:41.248
but Laura's more of a salad gal.
- Oh, yeah.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.083
- What's that now?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.918
- We're kidding. We're not gonna
stop for a hoagie

09:45.018 --> 09:46.754
in the middle of your surgery.
Who does that?

09:46.854 --> 09:48.689
We're focused on you,
and only you.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.824
- Okay, well, hoagies,
I love you, guys.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.893
- Uh-oh, okay, looks like
the drugs are kicking in.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.094
Hello?
[both laugh]

09:54.194 --> 09:55.295
- You guys are hoagies.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.764
- We're all hoagies.
- We are.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.198
- Yeah.
- You got our numbers.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.067
- I don't know if you need
any extra help,

10:00.167 --> 10:02.369
but if--if you wanted me
in there, I'm--I'm a nurse.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.737
- She's a really
pretty nurse, guys.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.238
- Thank you, Maggie,

10:05.338 --> 10:07.240
but you--you did your job.
You got her here.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.776
We're gonna do our job now.
And don't worry about anything.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.043
She's gonna do great.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.712
Gonna go get the show
on the road.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.214
- Okay, little hoags.
[both laugh]

10:17.417 --> 10:20.120
- Uh...

10:20.220 --> 10:23.390
so, um, looks like
they're kicking me out,

10:23.490 --> 10:27.060
so I'm gonna get out of here,
but you're gonna do so great,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.730
and I'm gonna be there
right when you wake up, okay?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.298
- Okay, I love you, Mama.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.333
- I love you too.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.635
Okay.
- [mouths word]

10:45.312 --> 10:47.114
- [sighs]

10:50.417 --> 10:51.985
What are you guys doing here?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.320
- Since Mark
wasn't allowed to come,

10:53.420 --> 10:55.889
he asked us to come instead.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.258
- [sniffles]
- Permission to hug?

10:58.358 --> 10:59.426
- Granted.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.895
[gentle guitar music]

11:01.995 --> 11:04.131
- Okay, guys,
I'm gonna need backup.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.733
*

11:05.833 --> 11:07.367
- [chuckles]

11:07.467 --> 11:10.070
*

11:15.308 --> 11:18.411
- You need anything, Maggie?
- Oh, I'm good.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.881
Thanks again for coming.
- No problem.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.682
'Cause if there's
anything you need,

11:22.783 --> 11:24.952
all you have to do is ask.
- I'm really--I'm--I'm great.

11:25.052 --> 11:28.221
- 'Cause we're here for you.
- Thank you.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.924
[whispers] Thank you.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.392
- You want some
reading material?

11:32.492 --> 11:33.761
I looked through
one of these magazines.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.962
They had pictures
of kitchens.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.997
I know women like kitchens,
so...

11:37.097 --> 11:38.465
- I do like kitchens.
- Okay, guys, you heard her.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.968
Let's find some more kitchens.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.072
[phone beeps]

11:45.172 --> 11:48.175
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a game I play.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.843
I'm a lonely troll,
and I have to kill orcs

11:49.943 --> 11:51.779
in order to get more gold
for my clan.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.446
- Hm.
- Yeah. [phone trills]

11:53.546 --> 11:55.282
Oh, no, that's an orc attack.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.450
- Paul, she doesn't wanna
hear about your game.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.019
- She asked.
- Put it away.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.387
- But they'll take my village.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.989
- Her friend is in surgery.

12:02.089 --> 12:05.358
Put the game away.
- I'll never get him out.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.495
- Oh, Maggie, if you're hungry,

12:08.595 --> 12:10.363
I brought some smoked meats.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.466
- Oh, wow, that has a--
a real scent to it.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.002
- Thank you.
I make my own spice rub.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.970
I call it
Ian's Song of the South.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.906
- You might wanna change that.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.908
- You want a taste?
It's really moist.

12:21.008 --> 12:24.111
- Um, it's tempting.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.980
Uh, I think I'm--I'm actually
gonna go stretch my legs.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.281
- Oh, we can stretch 'em
for you.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.917
- Yeah, we'll stretch your legs.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.819
- I'll stretch my own legs,
but thank you.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.120
- All right.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.454
We'll just hold down
the fort then.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.523
- Okay.
- Orc attack?

12:36.623 --> 12:37.958
[phone beeps]

12:38.058 --> 12:40.393
Turn off that--
turn off that phone.

12:40.493 --> 12:45.032
*

12:45.132 --> 12:46.366
- [groans]
- Hey, Maggie...

12:46.466 --> 12:47.868
- Hey.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.236
- Look, I was trying to
find you.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.838
I just dropped in on
the operating room,

12:50.938 --> 12:52.139
and it's going really well.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.974
- Yes! Are you serious?
- Yeah.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.177
- She's okay? She's doing okay?
Am I shouting?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.079
- Yes, a little bit.
It couldn't be going better...

12:59.179 --> 13:01.014
- Okay, good.
- All right?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.082
- We got her halfway through,
and she's doing great.

13:02.182 --> 13:05.185
- That is--that is a relief.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.386
- How are you doing?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.388
- You know, I'm great.
[chuckles]

13:08.488 --> 13:09.890
Just chilling.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.558
- 'Cause this can be
pretty hard.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.426
- Yeah.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.428
It's really hard.
- Yeah.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.232
- 'Cause I--I don't know
what to say to her, you know,

13:19.332 --> 13:21.101
and sometimes,
I don't even have an answer,

13:21.201 --> 13:23.403
or sometimes, I'll say
something, and then I'm like,

13:23.503 --> 13:26.306
"Why did I say that?"
But I'd like to do something.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.042
I would really like to
be able to do something.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.178
So I end up driving to
Paper Source

13:31.278 --> 13:34.114
at 9:45 at night,
buying a $78 pen,

13:34.214 --> 13:37.250
and a binder that's only gonna
have one pamphlet in it.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.186
And it's about
saving your nipples,

13:39.286 --> 13:42.890
'cause her nipples--[whimpers]--
are really important to her.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.128
- Listen, Maggie, I just
wanted to assure you that

13:48.228 --> 13:50.197
you're doing exactly
what you should be doing, okay?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.199
Because you found her
the best doctors....

13:52.299 --> 13:53.533
- Yeah.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.835
- And I know you're saying
the right things to her,

13:55.936 --> 13:58.071
because I've seen
you guys together,

13:58.171 --> 14:00.307
and you know her
better than anyone else.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.209
And you caught it early...
- Yeah.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.543
- And you're making sure
that she gets

14:03.643 --> 14:05.278
treatment straight away, so...

14:05.378 --> 14:08.015
- Thank God she was so nosy.
- [chuckles]

14:08.115 --> 14:11.484
- She is a piece of work, right?
[chuckles]

14:11.584 --> 14:13.220
If you would knew the--

14:13.320 --> 14:16.389
the lengths that she would
go to for me...

14:16.489 --> 14:18.926
- And you for her, clearly.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.363
Hey, come on.
You're gonna be okay.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.332
- What is that?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.300
- I'm, you know--I'm just--
- [chuckles]

14:27.400 --> 14:29.369
Can I have a hug?
- Yeah, of course.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.071
[chuckles]

14:31.171 --> 14:33.140
Yeah.
All right.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.474
- Thank you.
- Mm-kay.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.376
- Okay?
- Yeah.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.248
- You're getting better at
this bedside manner thing.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.183
[chuckles]
- Well, you know, I'm--

14:43.283 --> 14:45.652
I'm sort of, um,
practicing a bit.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.254
- Is that so?

14:47.354 --> 14:48.989
- Yeah, I did, uh,
try it on one patient.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.390
- No. [laughs]
- Yeah, I mean, she--

14:50.490 --> 14:51.624
you know, she can't hear,
so it's fine.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.093
- [laughs]
- Maggie?

14:53.193 --> 14:54.594
Is this man making you cry?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.896
- Oh, no, guys, I'm--I'm good.

14:56.997 --> 15:00.033
- Okay, Doctor, carry on.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.601
Stand down.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.036
*

15:03.136 --> 15:04.537
- Sorry, so you have
a police escort?

15:04.637 --> 15:07.274
- Emma and I taught the police
force how to striptease.

15:10.710 --> 15:10.810
.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.546
[gentle guitar music]

15:14.414 --> 15:15.648
- Mark?
What are you doing out here?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.484
- Hey, what's up?
I was just, um,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.386
taking a break from
checking out these, uh--

15:19.486 --> 15:21.221
these expired registrations.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.956
- That sounds like a lie.
- Okay, it is.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.691
How--how's she doing?
Do you--do you know anything?

15:24.791 --> 15:26.960
- Yes, Dr. Ericson, um,
stopped by the operating room,

15:27.060 --> 15:29.229
and she's--
everything's going great.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.264
- Yes--yes! Okay, that's great.
That's good--

15:31.364 --> 15:32.699
that's good to hear.
Do, uh--do we know--

15:32.799 --> 15:34.401
what do we know about
these--these ladies, though?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.036
- The doctors?
- Yeah, 'cause, you know,

15:36.136 --> 15:37.470
I've been--I was checking
the--the police database

15:37.570 --> 15:39.239
to see if they had ever
been arrested,

15:39.339 --> 15:40.640
and they--and they weren't,
but they--they may have aliases.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.542
That's the thing, so...
- Okay...

15:42.642 --> 15:44.511
they are literally the best
breast cancer doctors

15:44.611 --> 15:47.947
in the whole world, okay?
They were on "Oprah."

15:48.048 --> 15:49.682
- Well, yeah, but what--
what does Oprah know?

15:49.782 --> 15:52.152
- Well, a few things.
- They just gotta get it right.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.221
They--they--they have to
really just--

15:54.321 --> 15:56.456
they gotta get it done.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.992
'Cause I just finally--
I, you know--I got her back,

15:59.092 --> 16:00.660
and now I can't...

16:00.760 --> 16:02.695
- I know.

16:04.764 --> 16:08.735
Okay, you know
who we're talking about, right?

16:08.835 --> 16:12.472
Emma?
She's, like, the strongest,

16:12.572 --> 16:14.174
most aggressive person
that we know.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.009
- [chuckles] Yeah.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.212
- You think that
this is gonna take her down?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.348
No way.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.983
Not today.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.153
All right, I think you should
come inside with me.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.188
- No, she made it
perfectly clear

16:28.288 --> 16:30.023
that she does not
want me in there.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.125
- You know, you don't have to
listen to her, right?

16:32.225 --> 16:33.760
- Oh, I didn't--I was not aware
that was an option. [chuckles]

16:33.860 --> 16:35.662
- Yeah, that's the secret
of our friendship--

16:35.762 --> 16:37.730
is that she just talks
for a long time,

16:37.830 --> 16:39.366
and then I act like
I'm listening,

16:39.466 --> 16:42.469
but then I just do
whatever I want.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.139
Okay.
- Yep.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.041
- Oh, also, um,

16:48.141 --> 16:50.743
they got Shastas from, like,
1982 in this vending machine.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.579
- Wait a minute, they got
straight Shastas up in here?

16:52.679 --> 16:53.713
- Straight Shastas.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.015
*

16:56.116 --> 16:57.584
- Straight Shastas.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.321
- All right, here we go.
And five, six, seven, walk,

17:01.421 --> 17:03.623
and fierce, fierce,
squish, squish.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.326
Pop that booty, booty,
and move that freaking booty.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.461
Yeah!
[claps, laughs]

17:08.561 --> 17:10.230
Oh, nice, Tony.
I'm impressed.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.499
- Since our strip show, I've
been taking private lessons.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.135
- Well...
it's paying off in spades.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.405
- [laughs] That's right.
- Knock, knock.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.474
- So we got all the cancer out.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.444
[cheering, yelling]
- Yeah! All right!

17:24.544 --> 17:26.579
- Maggie--Maggie, can you--
can you--[clears throat]

17:26.679 --> 17:28.215
- Yeah, yeah.
What's--

17:28.315 --> 17:29.516
- There's one thing.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.284
- It's just, um,

17:31.384 --> 17:35.455
I underestimated how very small
her actual breasts were.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.390
- We hadn't seen
breasts that small

17:37.490 --> 17:40.360
since we operated on
an old Sicilian grandmother.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.794
- She's gonna repeat
that detail.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.464
- I had to make 'em
a little bigger.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.799
Do you think she's gonna be
upset about that?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.435
- Oh, I think she'll be
all right.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.437
They're gonna be bigger, guys!

17:50.537 --> 17:53.072
- All right!
If that's what she wants.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.074
- That's what she wants.
She's gonna want it.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.243
Oh, my God,
I love you guys so much.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.478
- Aww. [laughs]

17:58.578 --> 18:00.213
- [giggles]
- You're welcome.

18:00.313 --> 18:07.420
*

18:13.260 --> 18:16.163
- Hey.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.131
- Hey, Mags.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.432
How'd it go?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.201
- Oh, great.
They got it all out.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.602
- They did?
- Yeah,

18:22.702 --> 18:24.404
and you're gonna love
your new knockers.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.772
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.540
We're gonna have to go
bra shopping,

18:27.640 --> 18:28.775
'cause they had to make 'em
a little bigger,

18:28.875 --> 18:30.410
but I said that was okay.
- Yay.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.678
- [chuckles]

18:31.778 --> 18:33.680
- Hey, do you know
where my socks are?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.382
- I don't think I packed socks,

18:35.482 --> 18:37.684
but I--I can ask,
if you want me to.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.852
- No, no, no, no,
I need my socks.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.455
I need the ones that I have.
- Hey, guys.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.224
- Mark.
- Hey, Em.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.658
- Hey.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.898
I got bigger boobs.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.566
- Well, okay, yeah.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.735
You can show those to me
at another time.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.338
Um, I know that you told me
not to come...

18:58.438 --> 18:59.739
- Oh, no.
- But Maggie told me

18:59.839 --> 19:01.374
we don't have to listen
to you anymore.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.575
- No, you do have to
listen to me.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.843
- I don't think so.
I think--

19:03.943 --> 19:05.712
I think those are
the rules now.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.180
- No, those are not the rules.
- That's right.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.715
- Those are indeed
the new rules.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.417
- That's correct.
- No listening to Emma.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.151
- I have cancer, so you have to
do whatever what I say.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.786
- But you don't.
You don't have it anymore.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.388
They took it all out, so now...
- All out of you.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.589
- Don't make me laugh.
- No?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.291
- Just go get me
my socks, please.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.526
- Okay.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.560
- Do you know
where these socks are?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.195
- I do. I have 'em.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.730
I--I--I know exactly
what she's talking about.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.598
Mr. Rodriguez to the rescue.
- [giggles]

19:25.698 --> 19:27.334
- Only three for a dollar.
Isn't that amazing?

19:27.434 --> 19:29.302
- Oh, well, don't go all out.
- That's what I said.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.870
- These are just to put on
her feet to protect anybody

19:30.970 --> 19:33.172
who comes by from
her vicious sharp toes.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.707
- Stop saying--ow.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.710
- Emma Scissor-toes.
[all laugh]

19:37.810 --> 19:39.246
- Guys...
- Okay, we need to let her rest.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.847
- Guys, come here--
come here for a second.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.682
- What, honey? What?
- Come here for a second.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.784
- What?
- I love you dummies.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.886
- Well, we love you, weirdo.
- I love you too.

19:54.427 --> 19:54.561
.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.729
- Get it, C-Tates.
Get it.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.498
- God, Channing Tatum
is a physical specimen.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.267
His abs should be in
the Smithsonian.

20:01.100 --> 20:01.968
- He's also a great dad.
- Oh, yeah.

20:03.102 --> 20:03.870
I heard he likes to change
diapers, like, all the time.

20:04.804 --> 20:05.572
- Oh, man, that's sexy as hell.
- Yeah.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.540
Hey, I wonder with
my new titties,

20:07.640 --> 20:09.942
if I can get a man like that.
- Hm.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.245
Would that be okay
with you, Mark?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.546
- You know, the moves are good.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.248
The moves are really,
really good,

20:15.348 --> 20:17.817
but he's no match for
DJ Mark of 99.7.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.852
* The Crush

20:19.952 --> 20:21.721
- No, no.
- He isn't.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.690
- [laughs] Oh, my God.
You're right, babe, he isn't.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.293
- The doctor wants to see you.
- Char-bar!

20:26.393 --> 20:27.494
Give me, give me,
give me, give me.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.329
- Oh, no, no,
you can't hold her.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.298
- Okay, okay, just put her
down here, though, then,

20:31.398 --> 20:32.765
'cause I gotta get a feel of
that sweet, sweet baby skin.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.401
- Come here, sweet girl.
- Hi, Mama.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.304
- Get in here.
- I missed you.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.572
- She missed you too.
- Aww.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.509
- Hey, Char,
that's Channing Tatum.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.910
- Oh, she's seen this movie
several times.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.578
- Excuse me?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.447
- What do you think
we screen at 2:00 a.m.?

20:47.547 --> 20:48.981
The Pony Dance
puts her to sleep...

20:49.081 --> 20:50.917
- No, no.
- But it revs Mama up.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.385
- Okay.
- Yeah!

20:52.485 --> 20:54.587
- Is this, uh, "Toy Story 4"?

20:54.687 --> 20:55.622
- What?
