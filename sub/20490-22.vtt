00:12.012 --> 00:13.213
Alright, just
stay cool, all right?

00:13.613 --> 00:14.779
As far as these guys know,

00:14.814 --> 00:17.217
the deal's going down
exactly as they expect it to.

00:17.252 --> 00:18.818
Wish i knew what they expected.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.223
<meow>

00:27.627 --> 00:29.629
hey, shal,
you getting all this?

00:29.664 --> 00:31.997
In living colour.

00:32.031 --> 00:36.436
Okay, the sign
at the end of the alley is
the one you're looking for.

00:53.653 --> 00:54.854
Where's haines?

00:55.255 --> 00:56.421
Couldn't make it.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.858
Couldn't make it, or afraid
that we'd doublecross him?

00:58.893 --> 01:00.060
You wanted to
buy some information.

01:00.095 --> 01:01.661
We've got that information.

01:01.696 --> 01:02.827
Deal with it.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.063
Let's see what you got.

01:04.464 --> 01:05.665
Not so fast.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.667
See, now that we've come
this far i want to know why you

01:07.702 --> 01:09.634
want these medical records.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.437
Now, why would
you be interested?

01:12.472 --> 01:14.074
Well, you see, these
must be pretty special people.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.476
I'm figuring there's more
to it than the doc let on...

01:16.876 --> 01:19.644
we should get
a piece of the action.

01:19.679 --> 01:21.681
The only thing you
can hope to get a piece of...

01:21.716 --> 01:24.449
is getting out of here alive.

01:24.484 --> 01:27.687
Well, maybe i should
ask that question again.

01:27.722 --> 01:30.490
These guys are
full of surprises.

01:30.525 --> 01:34.494
Guess what? So are we.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.900
I don't think that's
gonna work with me.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.867
Doesn't have to.

01:42.902 --> 01:46.106
See, when they made me
they wired my pain centres 24/7.

01:46.141 --> 01:49.709
It's a whole new
relationship with hurts.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.481
Who are you?

01:56.516 --> 01:58.918
We're the guys
that are gonna kill you.

01:59.319 --> 02:02.522
I don't think so.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.527
There's nothing here.

02:16.936 --> 02:18.903
I am adam kane.

02:18.938 --> 02:22.341
I was a pioneer
of genetic research,

02:22.376 --> 02:25.710
manipulating dna
to save human lives.

02:25.745 --> 02:30.950
But in many their
genes unexpectedly mutated.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.753
They developed
super-human abilities.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.547
Together with four
of the most powerful

03:02.582 --> 03:06.586
i fight to protect a world
that doesn't even know we exist.

03:06.621 --> 03:10.590
We are... mutant x.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.298
No. We should've
taken them, shal.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.935
Were you unconscious
when he was beating the crap

03:21.970 --> 03:23.353
out of the rest of us?

03:23.388 --> 03:24.702
They took us by surprise.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.339
Brennan's right. If we'd
been prepared, we could...

03:26.374 --> 03:27.941
look, if you two are through
with your macho posturing,

03:28.341 --> 03:29.943
then let's just think
about this for a minute, okay?

03:29.978 --> 03:31.509
These were not just mutants.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.546
They were mutants with powers
that we have never seen before.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.548
Brennan, let
me see the flex cam.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.769
Good, thanks.

03:38.804 --> 03:41.920
It's pretty wild.

03:41.955 --> 03:46.324
See, the guy with the
telekinetic punch... i mean,

03:46.359 --> 03:48.761
that's similar to some
of the other brain-based
stuff we've seen,

03:49.162 --> 03:51.164
but... but the guy who ties
people into his pain centres,

03:51.199 --> 03:52.765
i mean, that's
a whole other deal.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.332
I agree.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.969
He said that when they
made him they wired him with his

03:56.004 --> 03:57.570
pain centres
permanently on, adam.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.189
That's just freakin' sick.

03:59.224 --> 04:00.773
But who knows how to do that?

04:01.174 --> 04:02.775
All right, look. Obviously,
i was not the only scientist

04:03.176 --> 04:04.777
out there dealing
with genetic research.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.180
We got somebody
out there playing around,

04:07.215 --> 04:09.147
trying to crack
the genetic code.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.748
If he succeeds, then,
you know, dealing with these

04:10.783 --> 04:13.186
made-to-order mutants will
be the least of our problems.

04:13.221 --> 04:14.787
What are you saying?

04:15.188 --> 04:16.754
I'm saying he could
create a super-plague.

04:16.789 --> 04:19.591
He could send a genetic ripple
through an entire population

04:19.627 --> 04:22.395
as easy as choosing
flavours of an ice cream.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.799
Richard, where are you?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.401
What have you done to me?

04:28.801 --> 04:29.968
What do you mean?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.604
They're looking for me.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.171
Who's looking for you?

04:33.206 --> 04:34.807
The guys... the guys who
want the name of the patients

04:34.842 --> 04:36.374
from the genetic records.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.376
They've already been
to the hospital, adam.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.213
The duty nurse said she
didn't know where i was and...

04:40.248 --> 04:42.132
and one of them hit her with
something... broke her ribs.

04:42.167 --> 04:44.017
I thought you said you
would take care of everything.

04:44.052 --> 04:45.583
I will take care of everything,

04:45.618 --> 04:47.620
richard, but i
want you to sit still.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.622
I'm going to send
my team over, asap.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.788
No. No, no, no.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.425
I'm not putting
myself any more at risk.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.392
I don't know
what's going on here.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.429
I... i have the
information with me, adam,

04:56.464 --> 04:58.431
and i'm going
to go to the police.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.398
Let them take care of this.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.035
Richard! Richard
i want you to calm down.

05:02.070 --> 05:03.453
I do not want
you to go the police.

05:03.488 --> 05:04.837
They will not
be able to protect you.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.839
You do not know
who you're dealing with.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.841
I'll have to take that chance.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.647
Did you get a location?

05:14.682 --> 05:17.215
Yeah. Derry and 15th.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.217
All right. Derry and 15th.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.654
Shalimar, brennan,
you go over there asap.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.656
You convince him
we're his only hope.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.258
What if he won't go with us?

05:25.658 --> 05:27.260
I don't know... you
kidnap him if you have to.

05:27.295 --> 05:30.063
Hurry. Hurry, hurry.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.674
Wha... what are you doing here?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.641
We could ask you the same thing.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.479
Responsible guy like yourself
playing hooky from work.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.081
I don't have
time. I... i gotta go.

05:48.116 --> 05:49.682
Don't think so, doc.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.485
You see, you were supposed
to deliver up some information.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.905
And instead, you've
tried to screw us.

05:54.940 --> 05:57.290
Look, guys, it
wasn't me, all right?

05:57.325 --> 05:58.856
It wasn't me. I swear. I...

05:58.891 --> 06:03.296
doc, all is forgiven.
We just want the information.

06:03.331 --> 06:05.298
And you will give it to us.

06:05.698 --> 06:10.103
Because i can be a real pain...

06:13.706 --> 06:15.308
i got a bad feeling
about this, shal.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.909
You saw adam's face when
you asked him who was behind it.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.876
He knows something.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.714
Yeah, well, maybe he's
still trying to figure it out.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.117
More like adam not
telling you you're on fire
until you see the flames.

06:24.152 --> 06:25.318
Hey. You know, what?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.285
I don't want to get into
your issues with adam, okay?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.322
Look, if somebody's
messing around with human
genetics at this level,

06:29.357 --> 06:30.923
there can't
be more than a handful
of people that could do it.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.490
He knows every one of 'em.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.092
Yeah, and he'll tell
us when he figures it out.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.129
Well, as usual, he'll
tell us when he feels like it.

06:36.164 --> 06:37.730
Shal, you're way too supportive.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.332
I hope he deserves it.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.699
Hey, slow down.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.902
Coming up on haines's position.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.740
Cell signal's coming
from that grey car.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.344
All right, i'm taking her down.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.555
Be ready in case he
tries to make a break for it.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.721
You know what? This stinks.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.159
What's he doing
still sitting here?

07:11.764 --> 07:16.569
Doctor haines?

07:16.604 --> 07:19.589
Hey.

07:19.624 --> 07:22.575
Oh, god.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.382
Adam, we found
haines. He's dead.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.150
Cause of death?

07:32.185 --> 07:33.751
There's no visual signs.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.753
My guess is someone
overloaded his pain centres.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.790
All right then, we have to
assume that the killers are in

07:37.825 --> 07:39.392
possession of haines's records.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.595
Look, there's gotta
be another way to get our
hands on that information.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.398
I'll access the
hospital's file server.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.001
Hey, adam, there's a security
camera beside 78 derry.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.804
Can jesse hack into it?

07:52.205 --> 07:54.972
I'm already on it.

07:55.007 --> 07:58.211
I've got the camera. I'm
just accessing the video files.

07:58.246 --> 08:01.779
Okay. Check it out.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.617
That's our guys
getting into his car.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.385
Fast forward.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.622
And there they are leaving
his car with his briefcase.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.824
See if you can zoom in,
see if you can read the plate.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.027
Okay. Increase the resolution.

08:15.062 --> 08:18.196
Here it is.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.233
Good. All right, now feed
that into the dmv database,

08:20.268 --> 08:21.834
see if we can find
out who owns this car.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.837
I'm on it.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.440
Just waiting.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.208
Okay. Car doesn't
belong to an individual.

08:30.243 --> 08:35.448
It belongs to a corporation.
Something called naxcon corp.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.450
What?
- You know those guys?

08:37.850 --> 08:40.253
Naxcon's my father's company.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.029
You know, my father
might be a class-a creep
but he's not a killer.

08:50.064 --> 08:51.195
Relax, shal, okay?

08:51.230 --> 08:52.832
There could be
a lot of explanations.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.433
Maybe somebody stole the car.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.836
Come on, these guys
are driving a car owned
by my father's company.

08:56.871 --> 08:58.402
It can't just be a coincidence.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.404
I agree. There's
gotta be a connection.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.641
Shalimar, what do you
know about your dad's company?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.961
Not much. I mean, he took
me to the office a few times.

09:04.996 --> 09:07.246
But he was always trying
not to let other people meet me

09:07.281 --> 09:08.813
because he was so embarrassed.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.250
When shalimar first joined
mutant x i did some research.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.670
Now, back then, naxcon was
a low-level chemical company.

09:13.705 --> 09:16.055
Well, it doesn't seem like
the kind of place to be into

09:16.090 --> 09:18.057
cutting-edge genetics, does it?

09:18.092 --> 09:20.024
He hated genetic research.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.260
I mean, that's
what caused my mutation.

09:21.661 --> 09:22.862
Everything that
made me different.

09:22.897 --> 09:24.063
People change, shal.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.265
Well, not my father.
He was all about appearances.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.067
You know, whatever
society thought was normal.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.434
And those guys we fought
tonight, they made him sick.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.471
The guys who killed haines
were after the names of specific

09:32.872 --> 09:36.876
people whose dna
must be needed to crack
the genetic code, right?

09:36.911 --> 09:39.278
Now these people
must be in serious danger.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.646
We need to find them.
We need to protect them.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.884
Exactly. But
the root of the problem is
in your father's company.

09:44.919 --> 09:47.286
So, shalimar, you have to go in.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.689
You have to find out what it is.

09:49.724 --> 09:52.857
<laughs> okay, hold on.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.693
You don't actually think
i'm going to go in there.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.495
You're the best chance
of getting past security.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.097
Yeah, and i have the
best chance of killing him

09:58.497 --> 09:59.699
if i got my hands on him, too.

09:59.734 --> 10:00.900
Shal, he's right.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.466
Oh, yeah?

10:02.501 --> 10:04.904
Huh. Well, let me
tell you a little story.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.724
For a kid, ten years old.

10:07.759 --> 10:10.535
Different from her friends.

10:10.570 --> 10:13.277
Different from her parents.

10:13.312 --> 10:20.084
Stronger, faster,
and a whole lot wilder.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.723
And because those parents
didn't see her fitting in,

10:23.758 --> 10:26.490
instead of loving
her for what she was,

10:26.525 --> 10:29.928
they threw her into
a psychiatric institution.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.332
Can you imagine being
ten years old and scared

10:33.367 --> 10:35.299
out of your mind
in a place like that?

10:35.334 --> 10:38.938
And they pumped me full of
enough thorazine to put ten kids

10:39.338 --> 10:40.539
under, but it didn't work on me.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.944
So when they found
out they couldn't sedate me,

10:44.979 --> 10:46.911
they turned to beatings,
to keep me down.

10:46.946 --> 10:50.950
Three or four grown
men laying into a little kid.

10:50.985 --> 10:56.172
Your parents must've known
something was wrong, shal.

10:56.207 --> 11:01.360
Yeah. My father knew.
He told them to keep it up.

11:01.395 --> 11:06.530
Whatever it took
to make me normal.

11:06.565 --> 11:14.773
But what they
didn't know was that my
powers were still growing.

11:14.808 --> 11:22.982
And then
one night, when the orderlies
came for me i was ready.

11:23.017 --> 11:26.986
I showed them what it
was like to be really scared.

11:27.787 --> 11:30.589
That's the night i ran.

11:32.992 --> 11:36.595
So when you're asking me to
reconnect with my loving father,

11:36.996 --> 11:38.597
that's what
i'd be going back to.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.365
Shalimar.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.803
Adam, until you came and
found me i didn't have a father.

11:43.838 --> 11:46.971
Please don't make me do this.

11:47.006 --> 11:50.574
Shalimar,
your father, or someone
working with your father,

11:50.609 --> 11:55.414
is playing with
secrets that could destroy
the world as we know it.

11:55.449 --> 11:59.018
We have to find a way in.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.200
Naxcon industries.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.837
I'm calling for nicholas fox.

12:17.872 --> 12:20.056
Can i ask who's calling?

12:20.091 --> 12:22.241
Tell him it's his daughter.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.643
One moment, please.

12:24.678 --> 12:31.015
Shalimar?

12:31.050 --> 12:34.618
Yeah, it's me.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.620
Baby, you don't know how long...

12:36.655 --> 12:39.658
how long i've hoped
to hear your voice.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.661
Well, i've been
thinking about you, too.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.029
I wanted to see you.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.466
Of course. Tell
me where you are.

12:47.501 --> 12:49.068
I'll come to you.

12:49.468 --> 12:53.072
No, i... i'll come to you.

12:53.107 --> 12:55.840
How's 2:00?

12:55.875 --> 12:58.242
I'll clear my schedule.

12:58.277 --> 13:06.485
Shalimar? You don't know
how much this means to me.

13:06.520 --> 13:14.693
Yeah. Look, i'll see
you a little bit later, okay?

13:14.728 --> 13:18.297
Okay.

13:25.104 --> 13:29.874
Hey, what you're doing is brave.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.311
Masochistic or stupid
might be more to the point.

13:32.346 --> 13:38.282
Families are supposed
to love each other.

13:38.317 --> 13:44.723
The only thing any of us ever
felt was bitterness and hate.

13:45.124 --> 13:50.729
Not much like your typical
tv sitcom family, huh?

13:51.130 --> 13:53.532
More like a real family.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.900
Nobody's family's perfect.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.536
Look, i'm not making
excuses for the guy, okay?

13:57.937 --> 13:59.538
But people change.

13:59.939 --> 14:02.741
And maybe he is interested
in making things right.

14:02.776 --> 14:05.361
Yeah, well,
if that were the case,

14:05.396 --> 14:07.947
he would've already
stopped breathing.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.152
Ready to go, shal?

14:13.187 --> 14:15.154
Yeah, i will be soon.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.967
This place is amazing.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.336
Last place was
nothing like this.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.773
Just a few offices
and a couple of labs.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.740
Yeah? Your dad
has been a busy boy.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.377
It's up to you to figure
out what nasty things he's

14:38.777 --> 14:40.379
been doing to make
all this happen, shal.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.600
You getting all this?

15:01.635 --> 15:03.202
Crystal clear.

15:07.206 --> 15:11.575
Shalimar fox. Here
to see nicholas fox.

15:11.610 --> 15:15.214
Okay, we have cameras above
the door and entry to the secure

15:15.249 --> 15:17.616
area, we've got motion
detectors in the ceiling.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.218
This is cutting
edge stuff, shal,

15:19.618 --> 15:21.620
and they're not fooling around.
- Can you get through it?

15:21.655 --> 15:22.821
Yeah, i can
get through anything.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.823
It's just going
to take a little planning.

15:24.858 --> 15:27.626
Shalimar?

15:28.027 --> 15:30.029
I can hardly believe it.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.831
I look different out
of a straitjacket, don't i?

15:32.866 --> 15:34.833
Easy.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.601
I'm sorry. That just came out.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.039
I deserve that, and anything
else you can throw at me.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.441
After what they did to you.

15:42.476 --> 15:44.808
What i did to you.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.646
Well, that was then, huh?

15:48.047 --> 15:50.849
Why don't you come
inside? I'll show you around.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.816
Thank you.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.453
One of the changes
that comes with growth.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.020
Without one of these,

15:56.055 --> 15:58.057
you'd have half a dozen guards
on you before you knew it.

15:58.092 --> 16:00.059
Welcome to naxcon.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.263
You look good.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.865
So do you.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.268
My god, i've missed
you becoming a woman.

16:09.668 --> 16:12.071
So, tell me how you
are, what you're doing.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.274
I'm fine. Have a
job in a clothing store.

16:15.309 --> 16:19.896
A few friends.
Life's pretty boring.

16:19.931 --> 16:24.483
I'm happy for you.
Boring is good.

16:24.883 --> 16:28.887
The way you were before...

16:28.922 --> 16:31.255
got through it.

16:31.290 --> 16:36.895
Of course you did. You've
grown into a beautiful woman.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.698
Why did it take
you so long to call me?

16:40.099 --> 16:41.665
Well, i don't
know if you remember

16:41.700 --> 16:45.704
the last
time we saw each other you
threw me into an asylum.

16:45.739 --> 16:48.107
Guess i wasn't racing
to get back to that.

16:48.142 --> 16:50.474
And why now?

16:50.509 --> 16:53.712
Guess i got past some stuff.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.880
Want to see how
you and mom were doing.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.718
Your mother and i split up a
couple of years after you left.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.086
She moved west.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.324
I think she always blamed
me for what happened to you.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.743
Adam kane took a lot from me.

17:07.779 --> 17:10.094
So what about this place?

17:10.128 --> 17:12.131
This is nothing
like i remember it.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.933
I've come a long way, huh?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.104
Anything?

17:20.138 --> 17:22.106
I've broken into
haines's private computer.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.943
Once i've reconstructed the
search i can confirm the names

17:24.978 --> 17:27.746
of the people that
the killers are looking for.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.313
Confirm?

17:29.348 --> 17:32.151
So you have some idea
who they're looking for?

17:32.186 --> 17:33.717
No.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.754
I didn't mean confirm.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.922
Are you okay?

17:38.957 --> 17:40.524
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm just...

17:40.559 --> 17:44.563
you know, want to find the
people before the killers do.

17:44.598 --> 17:48.567
What do you want me to do?
Pretend that i believe you?

17:48.967 --> 17:52.171
I want you to
stay out of my head.

17:52.206 --> 17:54.973
You're not invited.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.378
Jesse,
i want you to patch me into
shalimar's feed from naxcon.

17:59.413 --> 18:02.146
Comin' at you.

18:02.181 --> 18:05.784
We've developed
the broadest range of
supplements in the industry.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.587
Surprised you haven't
moved into genetic research.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.589
You know, modified
grains, that sort of thing.

18:10.624 --> 18:12.556
That's a science
that betrayed me once.

18:12.591 --> 18:16.195
I have no interest
in giving it another chance.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.197
What's in there?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.199
Oh, the labs where we
do our most cutting edge r&d.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.201
I'd show you around,
but they have some...

18:22.236 --> 18:24.603
...sensitive tests set up.

18:24.638 --> 18:27.005
Sounds mysterious.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.007
Shalimar, whatever we're
looking for is behind that door.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.574
What's in there?

18:30.609 --> 18:32.211
They're protected with more
security systems than the rest

18:32.246 --> 18:33.777
of the place put together.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.215
Our competitors are always
trying to get an early look.

18:36.250 --> 18:41.019
Let's go back to
my office and we'll talk.

18:41.054 --> 18:45.424
I still want
to know more about you.

18:45.459 --> 18:46.990
Told you...

18:47.025 --> 18:49.828
knowing you work in a clothing
store doesn't tell me anything.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.830
I want to know what
you do with your spare time.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.233
What you like,
what you care about.

18:54.633 --> 18:59.002
I don't know. I like
exercise. I like being outside.

18:59.037 --> 19:03.442
I'm not crazy about being
cooped up in a place like this.

19:03.477 --> 19:07.811
And how do you feel?

19:07.846 --> 19:10.649
You mean am i
still different? Yeah.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.016
But you're okay?

19:13.051 --> 19:15.854
I mean, after what
that bastard did to you?

19:15.889 --> 19:18.222
Who?

19:18.257 --> 19:21.860
The doctor from
genomex. Adam kane.

19:21.895 --> 19:25.429
You were too
young to understand,

19:25.464 --> 19:28.267
but i found out a lot
of things about him afterwards.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.634
What are you talking about?

19:30.669 --> 19:34.873
It's not important now. Now,
he's water under the bridge.

19:34.908 --> 19:39.077
What's important is we're
together again. You and me.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.480
I've got so
much more to show you.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.855
You know what, i should go.

19:51.890 --> 19:56.660
Shalimar...
i don't want this to end.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.299
I think it might be a little
too late for cheery family

20:00.699 --> 20:04.303
dinners and opening
presents around the tree.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.670
No.

20:06.705 --> 20:12.310
Not too late. Not
if we don't want it to be.

20:12.345 --> 20:17.916
You know what? Let's
not rush this, okay?

20:17.951 --> 20:21.119
I'll see you.

20:31.930 --> 20:36.700
Well?

20:36.735 --> 20:42.741
It was good. It happened exactly
the way you said it would.

20:43.141 --> 20:45.944
So just continue on
as we planned, nicholas...

20:45.979 --> 20:49.165
...and you'll
have your daughter back.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.351
Both of us will
have everything we want.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.255
Okay.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.891
We're talking about a
security system that'd make the

20:59.926 --> 21:01.858
pentagon look
like an open house.

21:01.893 --> 21:04.095
Besides the motion detectors
and full spectrum scanners,

21:04.130 --> 21:06.298
the elevator doors which
give access to the secure area

21:06.333 --> 21:08.517
are tricked out
with a retinal scan.

21:08.552 --> 21:10.702
So a fly couldn't
sneak in there.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.470
Well, could if he
had the right accessories.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.273
The whole system is
controlled by security cards.

21:16.308 --> 21:19.076
I figured that shalimar's
dad had the highest security

21:19.111 --> 21:21.513
rating, so i recorded the coded
transmissions from his card.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.316
So all we have to do is
transfer that onto a new card.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.882
Exactly.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.519
I got two cards already
mocked up and ready to be coded.

21:27.919 --> 21:30.722
Now, as for the
retinal scan, i made a scan
of shalimar's dad's eye.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.925
All i got to do is make
a holographic image of it and we

21:33.960 --> 21:35.492
should be home free.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.128
Yeah, well, except
then you gotta get in there,

21:37.163 --> 21:38.347
then you gotta tap into
their information system.

21:38.382 --> 21:39.531
Shalimar and i could
be in there within an hour.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.549
Great.

21:40.584 --> 21:41.498
No way.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.100
Shalimar, you're the only
one who's been in the building.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.537
Look, i told
you guys before - i don't
think my father's involved.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.939
Shalimar, it's
a hell of a time to develop
a set of family values.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.506
Do you know what, jess?

21:49.541 --> 21:51.543
Why don't you pour yourself a
big glass of "shut the hell up"?

21:51.578 --> 21:52.709
All right, you two guys relax.

21:52.744 --> 21:53.945
Shalimar, all
you have to do is guide.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.547
Jesse'll take it from there.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.914
Whatever.

21:57.949 --> 22:01.153
Adam, i got
the information back of the
names on haines's database.

22:01.188 --> 22:02.354
And?

22:02.754 --> 22:04.356
There was two.

22:04.756 --> 22:07.559
Christopher darnell and
a woman named elizabeth burton.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.526
That's it?

22:09.561 --> 22:11.563
I uploaded the information
onto the main computer.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.530
All right. You two go find them.

22:13.565 --> 22:15.567
It's imperative that we get to
them before the other guys do.

22:15.602 --> 22:18.370
Go.

22:22.374 --> 22:25.177
You know, there was
another name on that list.

22:25.212 --> 22:27.544
Yours.

22:27.579 --> 22:31.183
So what the hell is your
name doing on a list of people

22:31.218 --> 22:34.786
needed by somebody
manufacturing mutants?

22:34.821 --> 22:37.154
My name's on a lot of lists.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.956
That's not the
right answer, adam.

22:39.991 --> 22:44.796
That's the only answer
available right now.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.806
Hey, shal. Shal,
what's going on?

22:54.841 --> 22:56.625
Talk to me.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.375
I don't know.

22:58.410 --> 23:01.813
I've hated him for so long,
and then i see him again,

23:01.848 --> 23:05.334
and it feels like none
of that bad stuff ever happened.

23:05.369 --> 23:08.820
Well, we look at things
different when we get older.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.588
You know what?
It's more than that.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.025
Okay, my father said
something about adam carrying
out some kind of plan.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.428
Plan?
Come on, we saw the
way he's acting.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.994
He's hiding something.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.031
No... he was as
shocked as the rest of us.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.452
I don't know anything any more.

23:23.487 --> 23:26.803
Oh, okay, shal, listen to me.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.805
If your father
is not involved in this,

23:28.840 --> 23:31.243
we will make sure nothing
happens to him, okay?

23:31.643 --> 23:34.045
Okay.
Look, i gotta go to the helix.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.647
And we'll talk when i get back.

23:43.655 --> 23:45.257
Dammit, we have
to change course.

23:45.657 --> 23:46.823
Why?

23:46.858 --> 23:48.460
I tried to contact the
first guy on the list - darnell.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.661
Yeah?

23:50.061 --> 23:51.263
He disappeared.

23:51.663 --> 23:53.230
That means our
friends got to him first.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.866
All right, listen, feed me the
coordinates for the next name

23:54.901 --> 23:56.868
on the list. We need
to get there before them.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.835
All right. Thanks.

23:58.870 --> 24:03.275
Listen, emma, did
you get any kind of a strange
hit off adam back there?

24:03.310 --> 24:05.895
Look, if i sense
something from someone,

24:05.930 --> 24:08.480
it's like a priest
hearing a confession.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.882
I can't talk about it.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.849
All right. Emma, he's...

24:12.884 --> 24:16.087
it's good to
have morals, but you need to
know when to cut him loose.

24:16.488 --> 24:20.091
Brennan, i'm really
worried about shalimar.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.093
Oh, so her you can talk about.

24:22.494 --> 24:25.497
Look, she's going through what
all of us have gone through.

24:25.532 --> 24:28.500
Adam is... is more of a father
to me than my own father was.

24:28.535 --> 24:31.320
All of you guys are my family.

24:31.355 --> 24:34.070
But sometimes i wish that...

24:34.105 --> 24:36.107
that my mom had
done the right thing.

24:36.508 --> 24:37.709
You know?

24:38.109 --> 24:40.512
That she had been there to
worry about me, instead of going

24:40.547 --> 24:43.715
off on whatever new age
kick was popular at the time.

24:44.115 --> 24:49.321
But, i mean, sometimes i still
think about looking her up.

24:49.356 --> 24:52.088
So why haven't you?

24:52.123 --> 24:54.090
Because when you can
see into someone's soul,

24:54.125 --> 24:57.528
you don't have the same
illusions that other people do.

24:57.563 --> 25:00.932
You want to believe that people
can change, but they don't.

25:01.333 --> 25:05.737
Shalimar has to realize that.

25:18.149 --> 25:20.952
If these things work the way
they're supposed to we should

25:20.987 --> 25:24.556
have free run of the place.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.748
Here goes nuthin'.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.385
Ready to see
what this is all about?

25:53.785 --> 25:55.387
Let's do it.

25:55.422 --> 25:56.988
Good.

26:02.594 --> 26:05.597
No! No! No!

26:05.632 --> 26:08.517
No, let me go!

26:08.552 --> 26:11.403
Hold her still.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.205
This is it.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.808
Let me go.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.209
Let's go.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.413
Hey... hey!

26:22.614 --> 26:24.215
I was hoping i'd
run into you creeps again.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.034
What are you doing?
Picking on a girl?

26:26.069 --> 26:28.145
Why don't you try
someone your own size?

26:28.180 --> 26:30.221
What? Didn't you
learn the last time?

26:30.256 --> 26:32.188
You look about my size.

26:32.223 --> 26:33.825
I don't think
you want to do this.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.441
Nowhere to run?

26:49.841 --> 26:51.443
Guess not.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.660
He's dead.

27:09.060 --> 27:12.263
I've got what
we need. Let's move.

27:16.668 --> 27:18.670
Em, did you have to kill him?

27:19.070 --> 27:22.674
I didn't even hit him that hard.

27:28.279 --> 27:33.484
Wow.
- Can you believe this?

27:33.519 --> 27:38.690
Welcome to the secure area.

27:55.907 --> 28:00.712
You still want to
believe this is all about
harmless experiments?

28:00.747 --> 28:03.480
Huh?

28:03.515 --> 28:07.519
Oh, my god. What
are they doing here?

28:14.325 --> 28:16.292
This is it.

28:16.327 --> 28:22.734
Just a few minutes, i'll
have the whole hard drive.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.537
Fox's security
signature can't be coming
from two places at once.

28:25.572 --> 28:27.103
Maybe it's a ghost signal.

28:27.138 --> 28:29.140
He's not supposed to
be here at all, you idiot.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.142
Contact security.
Get a confirmation on this.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.109
(whispered) that's eckhart.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.746
(whispered) what
the hell's he doing here?

28:35.146 --> 28:36.312
(whispered) i've no idea.

28:36.347 --> 28:38.349
I want the lower labs
scanned with a fine tooth comb,

28:38.750 --> 28:41.152
and if anyone has been here...

28:41.187 --> 28:43.555
(whispered) shalimar, don't.

28:43.955 --> 28:45.557
(whispered) i can
take care of him right now.

28:45.957 --> 28:48.359
(whispered) we're
taking this back to adam.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.162
Come on.

28:54.766 --> 28:57.168
Get him.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.774
They couldn't
have gone through walls.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.542
Oh, yes, they could.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.579
When the others
return, send them to me.

29:07.979 --> 29:10.782
We have to prepare for guests.

29:18.857 --> 29:20.824
Okay, adam, we've been patient.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.861
I want to know what
the hell eckhart's doing
at my father's company.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.863
He's tricked your father
into providing him with the

29:25.898 --> 29:28.466
resources that he needs
to support his new project.

29:28.501 --> 29:30.433
Which is?

29:30.468 --> 29:32.870
Well, according to the
material on these hard drives,

29:32.905 --> 29:35.273
eckhart is on the verge
of controlling the keys to life.

29:35.673 --> 29:37.675
What he plans to
do with it, of course,

29:37.710 --> 29:39.642
we'll have to ask him in person.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.679
Okay, if he's so close
to having his hands on such big

29:42.080 --> 29:44.848
secrets, why are
his mutants so messed up?

29:44.883 --> 29:46.885
The guy who died in the
flower shop had the metabolism

29:46.920 --> 29:49.287
of an eighty-year-old, adam.

29:49.687 --> 29:53.291
Eckhart is attempting
to do selective mutation
from a specific blueprint.

29:53.691 --> 29:57.495
But he doesn't have the required
dna to perfect the process.

29:57.530 --> 30:01.299
The samples that he's collecting
will allow him to do that.

30:01.334 --> 30:02.901
How do you know all this?

30:03.301 --> 30:04.868
That's not important
how i know it.

30:04.903 --> 30:06.504
What's important is if
we can get in there, we get him.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.471
We shut his operation
down as quickly as possible.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.909
So i want to ready the helix
for immediate takeoff and then

30:10.944 --> 30:13.311
you four are going in.

30:14.512 --> 30:16.915
No.

30:20.518 --> 30:21.719
Whoa... emma,
what are you doing?

30:21.754 --> 30:23.286
You were right, brennan.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.723
There's
a point where you have to
go past your usual moral code.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.526
Now i've understood what's
been going on for a long time.

30:28.927 --> 30:31.329
And i think the rest
of you deserve to know, too.

30:31.364 --> 30:33.731
Emma, stop it.

30:34.132 --> 30:38.136
I could make you talk, adam, but
you're going to do it yourself.

30:38.171 --> 30:42.540
So tell them about
that third name on the list.

30:42.575 --> 30:46.945
Tell them what it all means.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.949
All right, so you
want to know how eckhart

30:51.349 --> 30:55.353
got the blueprint for making
mutants? He got it from me.

30:55.388 --> 30:57.355
What?

30:57.755 --> 31:00.558
After i realized the genetic
mutations that my therapies

31:00.959 --> 31:03.361
were causing, i stopped
using them to treat people,

31:03.396 --> 31:05.763
but i couldn't just
throw that information away,

31:06.164 --> 31:09.767
so i gathered specific genetic
samples, including my own dna,

31:09.802 --> 31:18.576
and i experimented... on
selected mutations, in secret.

31:18.611 --> 31:20.979
Yours was the
third name on the list?

31:21.379 --> 31:23.781
He needs our dna
to complete my work.

31:24.182 --> 31:25.748
He wants to re-create it.

31:25.783 --> 31:28.987
That's what my dad
was trying to tell me.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.360
You're no better than eckhart.

31:37.395 --> 31:40.198
I was on the verge
of cracking the genetic code.

31:40.233 --> 31:44.202
The possibilities
for humanity...

31:44.237 --> 31:47.370
they were limitless.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.372
So you were just
in it for the knowledge?

31:49.407 --> 31:51.409
Well, it must be hard going
back to being plain old adam

31:51.444 --> 31:53.411
kane after playing
god for so long.

31:53.811 --> 31:55.813
All right, look, i knew nobody
should have this information.

31:55.848 --> 31:57.815
It was too dangerous for anyone
to have, so what did i do?

31:57.850 --> 32:03.021
I stopped my experiments.
I encrypted my information.

32:03.056 --> 32:06.224
I took it out of genomex
as quickly as i could.

32:06.259 --> 32:08.626
You can't hide
anything from eckhart.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.193
You should know that.

32:10.228 --> 32:11.829
For all we know,
you wanted him to have it.

32:11.864 --> 32:13.448
What does that mean?

32:13.483 --> 32:14.998
I don't know. Okay?

32:15.033 --> 32:16.234
All i know is we're having
a hard time believing anything

32:16.634 --> 32:19.437
that's coming out
of your mouth right now.

32:19.472 --> 32:20.856
Wait... wait.

32:20.891 --> 32:22.240
Where you going?

32:22.275 --> 32:24.207
To naxcon.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.445
I'm going to get
my father away from eckhart
before he gets in too deep.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.213
Shalimar, it's
too late for that.

32:30.248 --> 32:36.854
I spent
all these years hating him,
thinking you were my family.

32:36.889 --> 32:43.461
And not it turns
out he may be the only
one telling me the truth.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.844
I'm here to see my father.

33:01.879 --> 33:05.848
Shalimar fox is
here to see her father.

33:05.883 --> 33:07.485
Listen, i'm not sure if you're
doing the right thing here,

33:07.520 --> 33:09.452
okay?

33:09.487 --> 33:11.089
I... you know, maybe
there is no right thing.

33:11.124 --> 33:12.908
But just keep your eyes open.

33:12.943 --> 33:14.657
I thought i had my eyes open.

33:14.692 --> 33:16.294
I was looking right at adam
and i didn't see him at all.

33:16.694 --> 33:17.860
Yeah, i know.

33:17.895 --> 33:19.862
All i'm saying
is just make sure.

33:19.897 --> 33:22.300
You know, before you go putting
your faith in someone else...

33:22.335 --> 33:26.704
thanks. I can always
count on you, can't i?

33:26.739 --> 33:28.723
Always.

33:28.758 --> 33:30.673
Uh, okay...

33:30.708 --> 33:35.113
we know where we're going.

33:39.117 --> 33:43.521
Why'd you do it? Why'd
you get involved with eckhart?

33:43.556 --> 33:45.523
Shalimar, i did it for you.

33:45.923 --> 33:47.125
You did this to
build up your company.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.726
You didn't do this for me.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.293
Eckhart came to me.

33:50.328 --> 33:55.333
Yes, he offered
me money for my business.

33:55.368 --> 34:00.338
But he offered me
the chance to get you back.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.740
What?

34:03.141 --> 34:05.943
The way you were, before
adam kane changed you.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.311
He's working on a cure.

34:08.346 --> 34:11.748
There is no cure.
It's not a disease.

34:11.784 --> 34:15.152
I am what i am
and i like what i am.

34:15.188 --> 34:17.554
Can't you understand that?

34:17.955 --> 34:19.956
And i would've liked myself
a whole lot sooner if i thought

34:20.358 --> 34:23.561
for one moment that
you and mom liked me, too.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.563
But we loved you.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.364
Do you know what it was like?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.768
Watching the pain you were in?

34:31.168 --> 34:33.971
Losing control
of your anger, your fear.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.774
What did you want
me to feel, shalimar?

34:37.175 --> 34:39.577
You were supposed
to treat me like a daughter,

34:39.612 --> 34:44.347
not like some kind of freak.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.784
You know this man that you
put your trust in is a murderer?

34:46.819 --> 34:48.786
Do you know that he's
killed hundreds of people?

34:48.821 --> 34:51.989
He said you would say that.

34:55.592 --> 35:00.798
It's for the best,
shalimar. You'll see.

35:05.203 --> 35:09.207
Adam has them so
turned around they don't know
who their real friends are.

35:09.242 --> 35:10.773
Hello, shalimar.

35:10.808 --> 35:15.213
Mr. Mulwray. It appears
we're all together again.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.580
I told you, nicholas.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.818
You're going to
have your daughter back.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.631
Dammit. Why the hell
haven't they called in?

35:33.666 --> 35:35.951
Because their comlinks
have gone dead, adam.

35:35.986 --> 35:38.312
Because eckhart knew
that they'd be coming.

35:38.347 --> 35:40.638
Adam, there's a call
coming in from naxcon.

35:41.038 --> 35:43.040
Patch it through.

35:43.441 --> 35:47.009
Hello, adam. Have you missed me?

35:47.044 --> 35:54.252
You're looking more
like your old self, mason.

35:54.287 --> 35:57.019
Feeling like a million bucks.

35:57.054 --> 35:59.056
It's amazing what a
new hair style can do for one.

35:59.091 --> 36:01.424
What have you done
with brennan and shalimar?

36:01.459 --> 36:04.262
I'm afraid you'll have
to come and see for yourself.

36:04.297 --> 36:07.465
And, adam, time
is of the essence.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.670
Where do you think you're going?

36:12.705 --> 36:14.237
Well, you ought to know.

36:14.272 --> 36:16.239
You seem to
know everything else.

36:16.274 --> 36:18.276
Look, adam, i didn't
want it to happen this way.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.477
None of us did.

36:19.877 --> 36:21.444
Well, wait, what are you doing?

36:21.479 --> 36:23.481
Your dna is
the last piece that eckhart
needs to control mutation.

36:23.881 --> 36:25.448
Are you just going
to deliver that up to him?

36:25.483 --> 36:27.885
I'm not going to
let brennan and shalimar
suffer for my mistakes.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.887
After he gets what
he wants he will kill you.

36:30.288 --> 36:31.889
I didn't say i
was going in unprepared.

36:31.924 --> 36:33.090
I have a plan.

36:33.491 --> 36:35.092
Good. So do you
want to fill us in?

36:35.127 --> 36:36.694
What do you mean, "us"?

36:36.729 --> 36:38.296
Yeah, "us".

36:38.696 --> 36:40.298
It took me
twenty-eight years to find
someone to believe in, adam.

36:40.333 --> 36:43.100
I'm not just going
to throw that away.

36:43.135 --> 36:47.505
Let's do this.

37:01.519 --> 37:03.921
I'm adam kane.

37:04.322 --> 37:09.126
I know who you are.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.935
Are you sure this
is the right thing to do?

37:17.970 --> 37:21.138
It's our only chance.

37:25.142 --> 37:28.711
Adam, it's been a long time.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.549
Of course, being in the
pod made it seem even longer.

37:31.584 --> 37:33.951
How'd you get out?

37:34.352 --> 37:37.555
You don't think i'd
devise a trap without a back
door for me to wriggle out.

37:37.590 --> 37:39.557
Six months in, any pod
that i hadn't coded the locks

37:39.592 --> 37:41.959
on was automatically reopened.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.362
I was hoping you'd have
used some of that time to think

37:44.397 --> 37:47.164
about all the
damage that you've done.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.731
Beautiful.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.733
As sanctimonious as ever.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.770
Actually, i did
use my time for thinking.

37:52.805 --> 37:54.737
I thought a lot about you,

37:54.772 --> 37:56.774
and what i planned
to do when i got out.

37:57.174 --> 37:58.776
How long have you had my files?

37:59.176 --> 38:00.778
I had the files
as soon as you saved them.

38:01.178 --> 38:04.782
But it took my people
until just a few months
ago to break the encryption.

38:04.817 --> 38:07.149
You always were the best.

38:07.184 --> 38:10.788
And now your brilliance and
your dna will change the world

38:10.823 --> 38:13.591
in a way you never
had the courage to.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.394
It was about the fact there
are some things that people

38:16.794 --> 38:17.960
shouldn't try to control.

38:17.995 --> 38:19.597
Adam, i thought
you'd understood.

38:19.997 --> 38:24.001
Destroying disease, creating
a race of perfect humans,

38:24.402 --> 38:26.404
turning on genes to
make people live forever.

38:26.439 --> 38:28.371
These are dreams that
people like you live for.

38:28.406 --> 38:32.410
Thanks to your research
and your dna i'll be the father

38:32.445 --> 38:36.414
to a whole new race.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.820
What's going on?
That's not the agreement.

38:42.855 --> 38:46.023
You can't do it.
I won't let you.

38:46.424 --> 38:47.625
I'll keep my end of the bargain.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.226
Your daughter will
be returned to you cured,

38:49.627 --> 38:50.828
as soon as i get what i want.

38:51.228 --> 38:52.395
What about your friends here?

38:52.430 --> 38:54.397
What have you given
them besides a lot of pain?

38:54.432 --> 38:58.436
All
he's given you is a life that's
going to end... very soon.

38:58.471 --> 39:00.002
What is he talking about?

39:00.037 --> 39:01.604
Why do you think
he needs my dna?

39:01.639 --> 39:03.641
He needs it to perfect
the process of mutation,

39:03.676 --> 39:06.043
because you're
just rough drafts.

39:06.444 --> 39:07.645
I mean, that's
why your friend died,

39:08.045 --> 39:09.211
and that's why
you're going to die.

39:09.246 --> 39:10.848
What? You forgot
to tell them this, eckhart?

39:11.248 --> 39:12.450
That's enough.
I need the samples.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.016
Take him.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.618
I don't think so.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.219
This is an electromagnetic
pulse generator.

39:17.254 --> 39:18.856
It's strong enough to
fry every piece of electronic

39:18.891 --> 39:20.458
equipment in this building.

39:20.493 --> 39:22.024
Really, adam.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.260
It showed up on the
sensors the moment you walked

39:23.661 --> 39:25.227
through the front door.

39:25.262 --> 39:27.630
And that's when it
was rendered unworkable.

39:27.665 --> 39:30.468
When are you going to learn
that i really am a step ahead.

39:30.503 --> 39:32.069
Take him.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.480
Lady, you're about to have
the worst day of your life.

39:42.515 --> 39:45.282
I don't think so.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.490
Come on.

40:02.099 --> 40:06.103
It's hard to share pain
that you don't feel, isn't it?

40:14.512 --> 40:16.514
You idiot. What did you do?

40:16.914 --> 40:19.717
I opened up the steam valves.
I released the pressure.

40:20.117 --> 40:23.721
It's all about to go up.

40:25.723 --> 40:29.727
You always have to screw
things up, don't you adam?

40:30.928 --> 40:32.930
Get out!

40:34.131 --> 40:35.532
How much time do we have?

40:35.567 --> 40:36.899
About a minute, maybe less.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.536
Is there another
way out of here?

40:38.571 --> 40:40.538
That way.

40:41.338 --> 40:44.141
Brennan, hit that!

40:44.176 --> 40:45.760
All right!

40:45.795 --> 40:47.344
Great!

40:47.745 --> 40:48.911
Let's go!

40:48.946 --> 40:52.550
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

41:10.568 --> 41:12.570
Let's go!

41:14.972 --> 41:16.138
Which way?!

41:16.173 --> 41:18.576
Go right! We're on our way!

41:35.392 --> 41:37.394
Hang on!

41:48.606 --> 41:50.608
Emma!
Hang on!

41:51.008 --> 41:52.610
All right!

41:53.010 --> 41:54.176
Brennan!

41:54.211 --> 41:57.014
Emma! Hang on!

41:58.305 --> 42:04.262
