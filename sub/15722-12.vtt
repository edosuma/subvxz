WEBVTT

00:01.413 --> 00:03.695
I have... Alzheimer's.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.852
I found this in your desk.

00:09.769 --> 00:10.982
"To Dad."

00:11.830 --> 00:15.113
"I am taking Mom someplace better."

00:15.650 --> 00:18.091
"So you can never
make her feel bad again."

00:19.375 --> 00:20.853
Jesus Christ!

00:21.030 --> 00:23.157
You're the head guy on that panel.
Advised the government.

00:23.241 --> 00:26.452
Told them that genetically modified fish
were safe for human consumption.

00:26.536 --> 00:27.998
That's my boy, Dr. Sandstrom.

00:28.196 --> 00:31.203
One day he's running in the yard.
Next day, his whole body's paralyzed.

00:31.361 --> 00:33.666
Basically we found a group of kids
with muscle development problems.

00:33.755 --> 00:36.630
We're looking into
their family histories... DNA samples.

00:36.834 --> 00:40.065
Bob, are you saying that
something was dumped there?

00:40.956 --> 00:42.471
It wasn't an accident.

00:42.658 --> 00:45.822
An accident implies I made a mistake,
and I did not make a mistake.

00:45.997 --> 00:49.042
I need you to sign these forms
that NorBAC is not legally responsible.

00:49.168 --> 00:50.682
Tell you what,
I'll sign those papers

00:50.765 --> 00:52.523
as soon as you start
doing your job around here.

00:52.747 --> 00:54.433
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- That means:

00:54.548 --> 00:56.180
figure out why
things are going missing.

00:56.335 --> 00:58.650
Find out who's fucking around
with my lab equipment.

00:58.738 --> 01:00.741
A National Guard unit in Canton, Ohio

01:00.878 --> 01:04.569
was doing a routine endurance course.
These are troops ramping up for Iraq.

01:04.797 --> 01:05.871
Excellent condition.

01:06.668 --> 01:08.742
They all came down
with the same symptoms.

01:08.906 --> 01:12.293
Headaches, flu-like symptom,
blurred vision, severe muscle pain.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.740
And then there was the psychosis.

01:14.058 --> 01:15.903
Sleepiness, right?

01:16.427 --> 01:19.031
- Okay.
- Sleepiness into coma.

01:21.277 --> 01:24.052
- Encephalitis Lethargica?
- Highly contagious,

01:24.208 --> 01:27.053
over 5 million people got it,
no one ever figured it out.

01:28.897 --> 01:31.473
Yes, Sir.
I'll put a note on his desk.

01:31.985 --> 01:35.202
Connor McGuinn's office.
I'm sorry, he's in a meeting.

01:35.485 --> 01:37.463
I'll make sure he gets the message.

01:38.278 --> 01:39.940
Thank you for holding.

01:40.097 --> 01:42.941
I'm sorry,
Captain McGuinn is out of the office.

01:43.207 --> 01:44.613
Of course.

01:45.777 --> 01:47.351
Connor McGuinn's office.

01:47.535 --> 01:50.443
Yes, Ms. Morrison,
I'll put you right through.

01:52.708 --> 01:53.990
Connor McGuinn's office.

01:54.188 --> 01:56.410
... then you're sure
it's Encephalitis Lethargica?

01:56.558 --> 01:59.942
Jill and I went back to Ohio yesterday
to double check the symptomology.

02:00.126 --> 02:01.960
All the Guardsmen have it: fever.

02:02.166 --> 02:05.132
You know, they can barely
stay awake. Hallucinations.

02:05.217 --> 02:07.762
It's progressing exactly like Lethargica.

02:08.038 --> 02:09.353
<i>And the prognosis?</i>

02:09.616 --> 02:12.641
Everything I've read,
anything from psychosis to death.

02:12.925 --> 02:16.443
Two million people died
during the last outbreak in the 20's.

02:16.757 --> 02:18.901
So, we're looking at
a highly contagious virus?

02:19.037 --> 02:21.811
Depends on the strain.
Which we haven't figured out yet.

02:21.906 --> 02:24.380
Connor, if there is another outbreak,

02:24.837 --> 02:26.982
it could kill millions again.

02:27.198 --> 02:28.992
Well, how did we stop
it back in the twenties?

02:29.256 --> 02:30.791
We didn't. We got lucky.

02:30.946 --> 02:34.450
Except for a few isolated cases,
it just vectored out and disappeared.

02:34.535 --> 02:36.770
And now it just
suddenly comes back?

02:36.945 --> 02:38.223
It's a retrovirus!

02:38.337 --> 02:41.331
It's something we all have
sleeping in our DNA.

02:42.577 --> 02:44.050
Is it possible...

02:45.646 --> 02:47.681
Could Al-Qaeda have
the means to wake it up?

02:47.926 --> 02:49.560
There's a lot of
dirty scientists out there

02:49.716 --> 02:52.140
who'd be willing to make
a few extra bucks to help them out.

02:52.358 --> 02:54.143
<i>Captain, Dr. Henshaw is on "two".</i>

02:55.446 --> 02:56.583
Thank you.

02:57.347 --> 03:00.430
Doctor, I'm conferencing you with
David Sandstrom and Caroline Morrison.

03:00.646 --> 03:03.803
Good. Good.
Dr. Sandstrom, can you hear me?

03:03.948 --> 03:06.860
Yeah, fine. How'd
the Guardsmen react to the Levodopa?

03:07.325 --> 03:10.042
Good idea you had there,
Doctor, but no...

03:10.288 --> 03:12.411
- No effect.
- Not at all?

03:12.565 --> 03:14.451
We even pushed
the dosage to the limit.

03:14.535 --> 03:16.581
Levodopa should have
gone right to the symptoms.

03:16.736 --> 03:19.670
Then you could be wrong?
Maybe we're not dealing with Lethargica.

03:19.828 --> 03:22.391
- We need you right now.
- You know what, Doctor? I've got to go.

03:22.605 --> 03:24.453
No, it's gotta be Lethargica.

03:24.717 --> 03:26.843
Maybe we're looking
at a different strain,

03:26.927 --> 03:30.023
<i>- or maybe it's been altered to resist Levodopa.
- Altered?</i>

03:30.515 --> 03:33.300
- You mean weaponized?
- It'd make the perfect weapon.

03:33.637 --> 03:36.783
Something we've ignored
for the better part of a century.

03:38.638 --> 03:41.732
Something
we haven't got a clue how to fight.

05:08.037 --> 05:11.903
2.12 - Lethargica

05:37.518 --> 05:39.262
Good morning.

05:48.228 --> 05:49.763
I'll take this.

06:07.587 --> 06:10.063
From the Sick Kids Hospital.
What did you order?

06:10.485 --> 06:12.543
One headache, supersized.

06:14.728 --> 06:16.393
Is that the DNA
for the National Guard?

06:16.508 --> 06:18.241
No. For the
Newfoundland families.

06:19.568 --> 06:21.323
I thought we were finished with that.

06:29.526 --> 06:31.042
Apparently not.

06:41.076 --> 06:42.183
David, wait.

06:42.398 --> 06:44.442
- What?
- What do you want to do?

06:44.636 --> 06:47.721
Same thing we always do.
Roll up our sleeves and dig in.

07:03.395 --> 07:05.163
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, Jill.

07:06.728 --> 07:08.290
Where were you?

07:08.528 --> 07:11.181
Honey  I'm kind of exhausted.
I overslept. What are you doing?

07:11.966 --> 07:15.782
David and Caroline have been on the phone
with Cpt. McGuinn all morning.

07:16.818 --> 07:19.342
So do you think it's
Encephalitis Lethargica?

07:19.907 --> 07:21.741
I don't know.
I guess it could be.

07:22.005 --> 07:25.683
Dr. Constantin von Economo
was the first to identify it.

07:25.915 --> 07:28.641
Encephalitis Lethargica. In 1916.

07:28.875 --> 07:29.752
Okay.

07:29.955 --> 07:32.043
Headache, nausea, fever were followed,

07:32.215 --> 07:34.362
often the very next day,
by chronic fatigue.

07:34.886 --> 07:37.341
There were similar
reports before that.

07:37.546 --> 07:40.672
In Lisbon in 1521,
in Italy in 1561,

07:40.935 --> 07:42.970
- and in Germany in 1605.
- Really?

07:43.178 --> 07:46.213
I didn't know that. So is this
the same thing, or a variant?

07:46.865 --> 07:48.880
- Who knows?
- Hey!

07:49.906 --> 07:52.351
David wants to see you two
in the conference room, now.

07:52.855 --> 07:54.362
Thanks, Wes.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.260
Hey, you guys. Check this out.

08:00.535 --> 08:02.762
David was right
about the GMO fish. Look.

08:03.097 --> 08:05.481
Mayko, this meeting is
about the Guardsmen in Ohio.

08:05.665 --> 08:07.123
This'll just take a sec, Wes.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.593
So these arrays, they're all
the same as Earl Jordan's son.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.831
The genetic inversions.

08:13.055 --> 08:15.892
The  parents are all carriers
of the anomaly... Look at this.

08:16.117 --> 08:18.071
This person was born in 1999.

08:19.135 --> 08:20.382
Born 1948.

08:20.987 --> 08:22.552
Born 2001.

08:23.267 --> 08:24.573
1939.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.003
So, these genetic anomalies

08:27.135 --> 08:29.071
have been around long
before GMO fish.

08:29.187 --> 08:31.220
So, the fish couldn't have
caused the genetic mutation.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.111
No.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.482
And the nuclear rods
were dumped in, what, 1950's?

08:34.687 --> 08:37.163
So the radiation couldn't have
caused any damage either.

08:37.356 --> 08:39.130
I'd suggest
you put this away for now.

08:39.316 --> 08:40.832
Come on, Wes.
Caroline knows we're not just--

08:41.058 --> 08:42.763
I believe this meeting
his called: The Ohio virus.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.701
Okay. Everybody up
to speed on the Guardsmen?

08:45.908 --> 08:48.292
Yes, I briefed them: symptoms, treatment.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.161
- Levodopa didn't work.
- Oh.

08:50.316 --> 08:52.202
We've got medical
histories, backgrounds.

08:52.726 --> 08:55.980
Okay, representative
difference analysis PCRs right away.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.611
Let's find out
what this virus is first.

08:57.728 --> 08:59.753
I have the infected blood
from the Guardsmen at my station.

08:59.846 --> 09:02.903
- Get uninfected blood from volunteers in the lab.
- Uninfected? Why?

09:03.055 --> 09:04.793
Compare the two.
Healthy and unhealthy DNA.

09:04.907 --> 09:07.553
It'll help us find out what's bad:
the disease-causing organism.

09:07.985 --> 09:11.763
So, I guess we pool the Guardsmen blood,
run a PCR and see what comes up virus.

09:12.187 --> 09:15.053
I want to do individual tests.
One PCR per vial.

09:15.355 --> 09:18.333
David, if we pool it
and run one single PCR it'll be faster.

09:18.445 --> 09:20.743
- Faster is good.
- Yeah, but it's not as accurate.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.076
There may be a different
viral load in each soldier.

09:23.185 --> 09:26.160
David's right. We would run
the risk of diluting viruses.

09:26.334 --> 09:28.215
So. One reaction per vial.

09:28.578 --> 09:30.351
- You're a horrible man.
- Thank you.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.052
Let's get the blood flowing.

10:19.806 --> 10:21.822
This is on the back burner, Caroline.

10:22.017 --> 10:23.710
We're  just giving it a little stir.

10:24.068 --> 10:26.101
Okay, so the kids in Newfoundland,

10:26.256 --> 10:27.780
this is their genetic family history.

10:27.938 --> 10:30.332
Black circles are female carriers.
Black squares are male carriers.

10:30.488 --> 10:33.082
You traced the disease all the way back
to the same mom and dad?

10:33.207 --> 10:35.930
Gail and Declan Perry.
They emigrated from Ireland in 1812.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.041
One of them must
have been a silent carrier.

10:38.527 --> 10:40.073
It's a classic recessive trait.

10:40.225 --> 10:42.593
- Just like blue eyes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:42.738 --> 10:44.851
Both your parents have
to give you the blue gene

10:44.966 --> 10:48.221
- if you're going to have blue eyes.
- I talked to a couple of local historians.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.243
And as far as we can tell,
the Perry family had twelve healthy kids

10:51.397 --> 10:54.263
But some of them had to have been carriers.
And then they moved out

10:54.438 --> 10:55.781
all around the Burin Peninsula.

10:55.968 --> 10:59.113
And they spread this recessive gene
all over the place like a silent time bomb.

10:59.305 --> 11:01.651
Generations later, people
don't know that they're related.

11:01.985 --> 11:03.523
Two silent carriers marry.

11:03.807 --> 11:05.173
And there's a one in four chance

11:05.357 --> 11:07.423
that the illness genes meet up
and make their child sick.

11:08.158 --> 11:12.152
So all the sick kids have
the same great-great-great-grandparents?

11:12.307 --> 11:13.893
Hmm, hmm.
And remind me,

11:14.028 --> 11:16.670
who was it who said that
this genetic anomaly had nothing to do

11:16.857 --> 11:18.852
with radiation or
genetically modified fish?

11:19.008 --> 11:20.630
Yeah, go pat yourself
on the ass for me.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.912
Or actually, maybe you should do that

11:23.047 --> 11:25.360
after you tell the families
what's going on.

11:25.865 --> 11:27.133
Mr. Sandstrom.

11:27.305 --> 11:28.673
Hang on a sec.

11:31.938 --> 11:32.981
What?

11:33.677 --> 11:34.722
Yes.

11:38.206 --> 11:39.281
Oh...

11:39.806 --> 11:41.962
Should I come over?

11:42.838 --> 11:45.150
No, no, no.
Thank you for calling. Right.

11:45.397 --> 11:46.612
Good work, Mayko.

12:00.065 --> 12:01.171
Hello?

12:02.106 --> 12:04.401
What? Do you speak English?

12:05.956 --> 12:08.233
Oh, good, thank you.
Listen, could you connect me

12:08.368 --> 12:12.082
to the Norwegian Institute
of Biological Sciences, please?

12:13.328 --> 12:14.892
Matias, is that you?

12:15.805 --> 12:17.471
David Sandstrom.

12:18.328 --> 12:20.272
I'm good, thanks, how are you?

12:20.956 --> 12:23.952
Good. Listen.
Encephalitis Lethargica.

12:24.275 --> 12:26.620
Yeah, that's right.
The bodies from the Spitsbergen dig?

12:26.908 --> 12:28.753
I'm writing a follow up paper

12:28.946 --> 12:32.033
on the Spanish Flu outbreak in Denver
we had over here last year.

12:33.068 --> 12:35.122
It's on...

12:35.388 --> 12:37.940
comparative symptomology
and misdiagnosis.

12:38.126 --> 12:41.291
Listen, is there any way
I can maybe get a tissue sample?

12:42.338 --> 12:45.210
Fantastic. Thanks, Matias.

12:46.476 --> 12:48.342
No, no, Caroline...

12:48.565 --> 12:52.183
It's not... No it's...
No, my... my father.

12:52.377 --> 12:54.432
He wandered away
from the nursing home

12:54.518 --> 12:57.310
and they don't know where he is,
and I can't... Yes.

12:57.437 --> 12:59.522
So, it's kind of... Yeah.

12:59.948 --> 13:01.430
No, no, no. See, if...

13:01.657 --> 13:04.153
If we can isolate the retrovirus
in the Guardsmen's blood,

13:04.236 --> 13:07.650
we can compare it to a tissue
sample from a frozen coalminer

13:07.865 --> 13:09.981
who died of Lethargica in 1928.

13:10.568 --> 13:13.002
That's ri...
I've already ordered it.

13:13.287 --> 13:17.043
Well, just... Have them keep
working on it. Vial by vial, okay?

13:17.126 --> 13:19.213
Oh! I gotta go. I gotta go!

13:45.195 --> 13:46.451
Hey Dad.

13:48.626 --> 13:50.902
You forget your way home?

13:51.627 --> 13:53.732
Why would I want to remember?

13:53.868 --> 13:56.340
Those old people drive me nuts.

13:56.718 --> 13:58.713
Come on.
I'll take you back.

13:58.798 --> 14:00.561
I'll stay, thanks.

14:00.787 --> 14:02.453
Dad, it's pouring out.

14:02.965 --> 14:04.473
I got a coat on.

14:05.866 --> 14:08.642
Would you give them a call
and tell them I'm out here

14:08.826 --> 14:10.472
enjoying the beautiful weather

14:10.698 --> 14:14.303
and I'll come back
when I'm ready to lie down and die.

14:14.547 --> 14:15.773
Which is not today.

14:17.907 --> 14:19.491
All right, well...

14:23.435 --> 14:27.171
I guess I'll just, you know,
hang out here with you for a while and...

14:31.416 --> 14:32.560
Fine.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.120
You have things to do...

14:35.456 --> 14:37.730
Take me back to the hell hole.

14:48.478 --> 14:50.912
- What do we got?
- Well, the doctors in Ohio

14:51.046 --> 14:54.522
are not giving us any encouraging news.
Three more soldiers on life support.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.451
Oh, shit.
You finished the PCR?

14:56.605 --> 14:58.563
We got a lot of
bacterial and megaloviral DNA.

14:58.657 --> 15:00.691
Nothing that would cause
the symptoms the Guardsmen have.

15:00.845 --> 15:03.650
- But something strange is going on.
- And that is?

15:03.766 --> 15:05.860
Well, we keep getting hits
on the same piece of DNA.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.901
It looks harmless,
but all the Guardsmen,

15:08.055 --> 15:10.180
their bodies are producing
the same obscure DNA

15:10.327 --> 15:11.993
fragment over and over again.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.502
- Sequence it.
- I'll get right on it.

15:17.485 --> 15:20.293
Caroline? McGuinn's holding on line six.

15:20.578 --> 15:21.921
Thanks.

15:23.098 --> 15:25.852
Hey, Connor.
We're working our tails off here.

15:26.038 --> 15:28.792
The Guardsmen,
they're getting better.

15:31.166 --> 15:33.560
What? I mean...

15:33.818 --> 15:35.502
That's fantastic!

15:35.635 --> 15:38.640
We have some researchers
at Fort Egan to thank.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.723
They said
they sequenced the virus

15:40.857 --> 15:42.793
and matched it to
Encephalitis Lethargica.

15:42.925 --> 15:45.663
So, David's theory was right.
Lethargica is back.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.441
It would appear.

15:47.615 --> 15:50.391
Anyway,  then, they dove
into the army's arsenal of drugs,

15:50.496 --> 15:52.363
worked 'round the clock
and developed a cure.

15:52.495 --> 15:55.263
Wow, that's fantastic news.

15:56.438 --> 15:58.332
Have you connected it
to Al-Qaeda?

15:58.787 --> 16:01.690
Homeland Security is on it,
but the bottom line is,

16:01.828 --> 16:03.160
if  anyone else gets infected,

16:03.297 --> 16:04.900
- we've got it covered.
- Right.

16:05.235 --> 16:08.053
Please pass on my thanks
to David and the rest of your team.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.571
- They worked hard on this.
- Thanks, Connor.

16:14.706 --> 16:16.100
They found a cure?

16:16.835 --> 16:19.771
Already?
How the hell did they do that?

16:19.965 --> 16:22.690
Well, I'm sure they had
a hundred scientists working on it, right?

16:22.845 --> 16:26.023
Caroline, if I had a thousand
scientists in a thousand labs,

16:26.155 --> 16:28.871
working around the clock
it'd still be pretty amazing.

16:30.065 --> 16:33.340
- It is amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah. It's more like bullshit.

16:33.697 --> 16:34.953
It took nine years

16:35.065 --> 16:38.041
to come up with a drug that had
any kind of effect at all on HIV.

16:38.126 --> 16:40.023
And these guys find
a cure for an unknown,

16:40.196 --> 16:42.931
- unresearched killer in 48 hours?
- Something's going on.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.840
Yeah, the government's
fucking around.

16:45.396 --> 16:47.840
Again. They did it with LSD,
they did it with mustard gas.

16:47.975 --> 16:49.871
They're trying
shit out on their own soldiers.

16:50.007 --> 16:51.761
Okay, how do we prove it?

16:53.767 --> 16:56.561
- Get the sequence of viral RNA.
- I'll try.

16:56.677 --> 16:59.001
Oh, and get the names of
the guys who worked on the cure.

16:59.157 --> 17:02.611
I mean, if they're that good,
maybe they should be working for NorBAC.

17:23.536 --> 17:25.532
- Good night.
- Good night.

17:28.425 --> 17:31.090
- So they are getting better?
- It's amazing.

17:31.306 --> 17:33.790
Whatever we injected them with
worked like a charm.

17:33.926 --> 17:36.502
Wait a minute. You don't know
what you treated them with?

17:36.745 --> 17:39.401
They gave me a vial
of something called RV-721.

17:39.647 --> 17:42.633
Then they gave me orders
to inject it into all the Guardsmen.

17:42.947 --> 17:44.851
- They ordered you.
- Yeah, I know.

17:44.946 --> 17:48.153
It reeks of human experimentation.
That's why I kept a sample of it.

17:49.298 --> 17:50.701
You've got the cure?

17:50.988 --> 17:54.241
I do indeed. I just don't
know what it was we did cure.

17:54.326 --> 17:57.463
I would really love to take a look at
what's in that vial. Can you get up here?

17:57.556 --> 17:59.742
I'm just as interested in this
as you are, Doctor.

18:00.098 --> 18:02.662
- I can be up there tomorrow.
- Great. I'll see you then.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.640
Matias, David Sandstrom.

18:15.846 --> 18:18.351
<i>We're just writing up
your hazardous transfer protocol.</i>

18:18.547 --> 18:20.950
Oh, great.
That's great. Listen...

18:21.327 --> 18:24.132
Who did you send
the tissue sample to in the U.S?

18:24.327 --> 18:26.061
<i>Well... What do you mean?</i>

18:26.257 --> 18:30.252
Well, you got the name
of a lab or researcher?

18:30.847 --> 18:34.192
<i>We didn't send a sample
to anyone in the United States.</i>

18:35.778 --> 18:37.033
Oh, really?

18:37.147 --> 18:40.373
I guess they got their sample
from someplace else, eh?

18:40.846 --> 18:44.032
<i>No. No. We have
all the samples that exist.</i>

18:44.867 --> 18:46.732
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:47.187 --> 18:50.050
Okay. My mistake, my mistake...

18:50.215 --> 18:53.212
Listen Matias, can you get me that
sample sent as soon as possible please.

18:53.388 --> 18:55.473
<i>- Yeah, sure thing.
- Great.</i>

18:58.368 --> 18:59.860
Yes, Bob, I know.

19:00.078 --> 19:02.071
Okay? I know, I know, I just...

19:02.257 --> 19:04.773
<i>- I want you to keep working on it.
- When does the sample arrive?</i>

19:04.927 --> 19:07.021
Right, the tissue sample
will be there tomorrow.

19:07.107 --> 19:08.383
<i>- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.</i>

19:08.655 --> 19:09.861
<i>- Okay. bye.
- Bye.</i>

19:10.005 --> 19:12.483
Well, I gotta go to Newfoundland
to talk to these families.

19:12.635 --> 19:15.970
<i>- Send somebody else, David.
- No, I can't send somebody else, Caroline.</i>

19:16.086 --> 19:17.800
It's personal. Listen,
here's what I want you to do.

19:17.937 --> 19:19.603
I want you to call
your friend McGuinn

19:19.746 --> 19:22.031
and I want you to ask him
how the fuck they were able

19:22.168 --> 19:25.492
to identify Encephalitis Lethargica
without the only known sample?

19:25.597 --> 19:27.182
<i>What? What are
you talking about?</i>

19:27.666 --> 19:28.900
That's right.

19:30.616 --> 19:33.002
You're telling me they have
the only sample in the world?

19:33.196 --> 19:34.262
<i>Apparently.</i>

19:34.566 --> 19:36.982
Then that must have been
the sample they compared it to.

19:37.117 --> 19:38.891
But you don't know
that for a fact.

19:39.005 --> 19:41.540
This is the United States
military, Caroline.

19:41.955 --> 19:44.810
We can track down
a couple of Martians if we have to.

19:45.065 --> 19:46.223
What's your point?

19:46.415 --> 19:48.851
Well in that case can
you send me a Martian?

19:49.147 --> 19:51.351
You know,
the sequenced viral RNA?

19:51.816 --> 19:53.821
Sure.
Any particular reason?

19:54.587 --> 19:57.433
Well, it's an amazing thing they did.

19:57.695 --> 20:01.191
You know, I think David is a little
envious he was beaten to the punch.

20:01.436 --> 20:03.541
He'd like to have a look at it.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.543
You know, scientific curiosity.

20:07.085 --> 20:10.083
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks, Connor.

20:47.978 --> 20:50.691
I know many of you have
had a long day of traveling,

20:50.866 --> 20:53.620
so I'd just like to thank you
for all coming today.

20:53.906 --> 20:56.083
Thank you for coming out, Doc.

20:57.405 --> 21:02.163
Basically, your children have
a genetic sequence which is reversed.

21:02.588 --> 21:05.021
It's like, instead of A-B-C-D-E,

21:05.198 --> 21:08.493
they have E-D-C-B-A. Okay?

21:09.257 --> 21:12.031
Now, this inversion, as we call it,

21:12.195 --> 21:14.120
means they can't produce a protein

21:14.426 --> 21:17.472
that would allow them to make
certain kinds of muscle cells,

21:17.668 --> 21:23.121
so without the protein,
their muscles become rigid and tense.

21:23.387 --> 21:24.751
Is there a cure?

21:26.145 --> 21:27.380
No.

21:29.065 --> 21:31.063
How 'bout making us one?

21:31.168 --> 21:32.633
I  wish I could.

21:32.776 --> 21:37.033
And I wish it was that easy,
I really do, but a cure is years away.

21:37.195 --> 21:40.120
- You got any hope for us, Doc?
- Yeah.

21:40.727 --> 21:44.971
This inversion DNA
is in all of your genes.

21:45.217 --> 21:49.060
Wait now, if it's in our genes,
then my little Hayley might

21:49.367 --> 21:51.982
someday stop being normal
like my other daughter did?

21:52.076 --> 21:53.693
Oh, not necessarily.

21:53.887 --> 21:57.553
See, it's a random
combination of recessive...

22:00.517 --> 22:01.913
We could test her,

22:01.997 --> 22:04.331
and then we'd know for sure. But see,

22:04.605 --> 22:07.583
knowing that it's genetic
is a really good place to start here.

22:07.776 --> 22:12.703
But if it's genetic, and we gave them
them genes, then why don't any of us have it?

22:12.888 --> 22:16.010
Well, like I was saying,
it's a recessive gene.

22:16.297 --> 22:18.722
So you need the right combination of...

22:19.685 --> 22:21.613
You need two recessive genes,

22:21.857 --> 22:26.271
one from the mother and one from the
father in combination to produce the illness.

22:26.356 --> 22:28.512
What if we want
to have another child...

22:28.717 --> 22:31.371
I don't want another baby to
suffer they way that our son did.

22:31.998 --> 22:33.741
Okay... Hum...

22:34.785 --> 22:36.413
Here's what we can do.

22:36.616 --> 22:40.723
Early in your pregnancy,
we can give you an amniocentesis

22:40.898 --> 22:43.670
and we can check for the presence of
the gene that stunts the muscle growth.

22:43.825 --> 22:46.433
So... so then we abort
the babies? Is that it?

22:46.565 --> 22:50.242
That's entirely your decision, but...

22:50.588 --> 22:54.933
The alternative is to treat the fetus
in vitro with the missing protein.

22:55.308 --> 22:58.113
The child would never...
would never get the illness.

22:58.268 --> 23:00.743
Unfortunately, once the child is...

23:01.067 --> 23:03.432
once the child is born
it's too late for the treatment.

23:10.426 --> 23:12.181
I'm going to advise Health Canada

23:12.297 --> 23:16.152
that they make this test
available to even the farthest outports.

23:16.535 --> 23:18.732
In the meantime...

23:19.775 --> 23:22.013
It's the results of our research.

23:22.536 --> 23:24.792
Take this home. Look at it.

23:25.165 --> 23:27.180
Show it to your doctors.

23:34.666 --> 23:38.641
There's a team working on something
similar to this in Pennsylvania.

23:38.776 --> 23:40.662
I'll get all our research
down to them...

23:40.866 --> 23:42.463
I appreciate that.

23:42.758 --> 23:45.331
If they don't find nothing,
how long's my son got?

23:46.318 --> 23:49.703
I'm not really sure.
My best guess would be...

23:50.225 --> 23:51.991
seven or eight years.

23:56.555 --> 23:57.880
Yeah...

23:59.038 --> 24:00.903
You know, Dr. Sandstrom...

24:02.818 --> 24:06.071
I got caught out in the water
one time, in a storm.

24:07.018 --> 24:08.773
I thought it was the end.

24:10.086 --> 24:12.012
But my son is suffering,

24:12.277 --> 24:16.463
and the best scientists in
the world are powerless to stop it.

24:18.168 --> 24:21.180
I've never been this scared
before in my entire life.

24:22.885 --> 24:24.460
I'm sorry, Earl.

24:28.297 --> 24:31.313
Thanks. For gettin' us the truth.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.382
Good luck.

24:51.977 --> 24:54.991
Wes, has anything come in
from McGuinn's office?

24:55.295 --> 24:57.121
Not that I know of. Why?

24:57.325 --> 24:59.470
David's expecting
some information.

24:59.607 --> 25:02.050
- I'll keep my eye out for it.
- Any word on Dr. Henshaw?

25:02.188 --> 25:04.902
- I haven't heard from him.
- Try to get in touch with him.

25:05.166 --> 25:06.452
I'll get right on that.

25:20.237 --> 25:21.340
Yes, sir.

25:22.115 --> 25:23.422
It's Wes.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.753
Everyone is getting
anxious about Henshaw.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.292
What should I tell them?

25:34.478 --> 25:36.383
I see. I will.

25:38.738 --> 25:39.882
Yes, sir.

25:48.265 --> 25:49.752
Yeah, that's the one.

25:50.405 --> 25:53.613
Look, Wes, it's the only number
I got for Henshaw, okay?

25:53.696 --> 25:55.571
I'm not lying to you so...

25:56.317 --> 25:57.531
I don't know...

25:57.626 --> 26:01.733
Call the airlines and find out what
flight he booked himself on. I mean...

26:02.548 --> 26:04.092
Yeah, good...

26:04.276 --> 26:06.892
Oh, and Wes,
when you're on with the airlines...

26:07.145 --> 26:09.622
I'm thinking of
Christmasing in France this year.

26:18.966 --> 26:20.003
Dad.

26:20.965 --> 26:22.292
You're late.

26:22.418 --> 26:25.293
Shouldn't have given you that extra key.
What are you doing here?

26:25.868 --> 26:28.343
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm waiting for you.

26:30.377 --> 26:32.002
Look how beautiful she was.

26:35.586 --> 26:37.392
- Still is.
- Well...

26:37.638 --> 26:39.762
Fortunately she takes after her Grandad.

26:40.907 --> 26:42.823
Yeah, she's a Sandstrom all right.

26:44.208 --> 26:45.892
Smart, good-looking.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.403
Cranky.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.952
She has your mother's eyes...

26:51.515 --> 26:52.820
Pretty soon...

26:54.158 --> 26:56.451
I won't know who she is at all.

26:59.097 --> 27:01.451
And when that day comes,

27:05.086 --> 27:07.813
I want you to put a bullet in my head.

27:10.057 --> 27:11.363
I need a beer.

27:14.186 --> 27:15.530
Me too.

27:27.536 --> 27:29.820
- Wes, where's Mayko?
- I don't know.

27:30.036 --> 27:31.360
- Jill?
- Don't know.

27:31.505 --> 27:33.151
- Bob?
- Not the hall monitor.

27:33.328 --> 27:35.271
Really? When did you get demoted?

27:40.756 --> 27:42.510
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:44.876 --> 27:47.011
I want to talk to you
about those kids.

27:47.278 --> 27:51.192
- Newfoundland kids?
- No. No. The prion study that you did.

27:51.645 --> 27:54.400
About memory improvement.
The kids in Pennsylvania.

27:54.587 --> 27:56.940
Sure. How'd it go with the families?

27:57.106 --> 27:59.973
Fine, fine. Really good, actually.
Really good.

28:00.108 --> 28:01.163
Where's Bob?

28:01.368 --> 28:03.153
I dunno. Why do you
want to know about the prions?

28:03.235 --> 28:05.261
Do you know if he sequenced
the Guardsman's DNA yet?

28:05.357 --> 28:06.120
- David.
- What?

28:06.196 --> 28:07.183
- Prions...
- Yeah.

28:07.917 --> 28:09.283
Tell me what you know about them.

28:11.517 --> 28:14.062
There were 500 children in the study.

28:14.205 --> 28:17.042
Yeah, I know, but you proved that
the prions could improve memory, right?

28:17.177 --> 28:18.602
Yeah, anywhere from 25 to 40 points.

28:18.716 --> 28:21.960
- Okay, that might do it.
- David, why are you going back to this?

28:29.216 --> 28:30.961
My dad has Alzheimer's.

28:31.688 --> 28:33.510
And I was just kind of
thinking that maybe...

28:33.598 --> 28:35.743
Oh, God. Your dad.
Jesus, David.

28:36.268 --> 28:38.740
We may have proved
they had memory spikes,

28:38.875 --> 28:40.660
but those children
still aren't going to survive.

28:40.755 --> 28:43.903
I'm just thinking, that maybe...

28:44.528 --> 28:47.320
- David!
- Carlos!

28:47.795 --> 28:48.980
Come and see!

28:49.145 --> 28:51.850
Could you just put
everything together in a box,

28:52.075 --> 28:53.652
okay, and put it in my office?

28:54.088 --> 28:55.122
All right?

29:02.257 --> 29:03.490
- Hey.
- Whatcha got?

29:03.586 --> 29:06.392
So Bob sequenced the DNA fragment
that kept repeating in the Guardsmen.

29:06.548 --> 29:09.842
- It's a reactivated retrovirus.
- You're absolutely sure?

29:10.005 --> 29:11.920
The retrovirus RNA
is in the serum of the soldiers.

29:12.038 --> 29:13.700
Blood, not just the cells.

29:13.845 --> 29:17.583
It seems to have come alive and it's moving
into the known cell parts of the blood.

29:17.725 --> 29:19.633
I don't believe it, there it is.

29:20.106 --> 29:24.151
All right. Let's find out if it's infecting
the other cells, if it's contagious.

29:24.338 --> 29:25.901
- David?
- Yeah.

29:26.027 --> 29:27.641
The frozen tissue
from Norway just got here.

29:27.716 --> 29:28.731
Finally!

29:29.785 --> 29:32.881
Wow, okay, everybody welcome
this coal miner to our lab.

29:33.016 --> 29:35.021
He's going to be
helping us out for a little while.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.091
He's got great brains, eh?

29:37.626 --> 29:39.833
David, the quality of the
sample doesn't look very good.

29:39.915 --> 29:42.851
It's the very best we got, Bob.
So, reverse-amplify the RNA, sequence it.

29:43.056 --> 29:46.540
Anything even close to what we've got
out of the Guardsmen - we celebrate.

30:27.936 --> 30:29.920
So I compared the genomes.
This is the Guardsmen,

30:30.016 --> 30:32.090
and this is the frozen
sample of Lethargica.

30:32.436 --> 30:34.661
- Identical?
- 99.9%!

30:34.905 --> 30:36.280
- It's amazing!
- You were right, David.

30:36.485 --> 30:38.991
A virus everyone thought
was long gone, here it is!

30:39.645 --> 30:42.491
<i>We isolated and sequenced
Encephalitis Lethargica!</i>

30:42.628 --> 30:44.792
It's just too bad somebody
else did it first.

30:45.015 --> 30:46.830
David, I'm having a hard time
finding Henshaw.

30:47.475 --> 30:50.042
He's a doctor from Ohio
on a flight yesterday.

30:50.185 --> 30:52.290
- How fucking hard is that?
- I'm doing my best.

30:52.525 --> 30:54.663
I've got a few calls and
I just need a little bit more time.

30:54.768 --> 30:57.400
<i>The guy has a cure for
Lethargica, Wes. Just find him.</i>

30:58.188 --> 31:00.142
- I'll get on it.
- Thank you.

31:10.357 --> 31:12.423
Oh shit, Simon.

31:12.858 --> 31:15.581
Oh, okay. I've had better hellos. But...

31:15.866 --> 31:17.240
Oh, all right.

31:17.435 --> 31:19.553
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm working on this other thing and...

31:19.828 --> 31:22.550
- I can come back.
- No, no. Let's get Mayko.

31:24.077 --> 31:26.131
- Mayko.
- What?

31:27.915 --> 31:30.063
Oh, holy shit. Simon!

31:31.436 --> 31:33.870
I guess this is your new way
of saying hello around here.

31:34.557 --> 31:35.761
When did you get in?

31:36.068 --> 31:38.182
Tuesday, last Tuesday I think.

31:38.405 --> 31:39.601
Oh... Nice.

31:39.716 --> 31:42.243
Well, to Montreal.
Conference at McGill.

31:42.387 --> 31:45.050
- He's here for 24 hours.
- Oh, to talk about the prions?

31:45.238 --> 31:46.542
Yeah. Come on.

31:46.795 --> 31:48.353
David, it's crazy.

31:48.856 --> 31:51.733
What about...
How about cognitive enhancers?

31:52.106 --> 31:54.352
Gingko Biloba?
Come on, Simon.

31:54.538 --> 31:55.880
No listen, there are therapies out there

31:56.026 --> 31:58.162
that can help protect the brain
against memory impairment.

31:58.278 --> 32:00.232
Not that will make a difference
to an Alzheimer's patient.

32:00.407 --> 32:02.780
But we don't know
what prions really do, David.

32:02.885 --> 32:05.150
No one does.
It's virgin territory.

32:05.426 --> 32:06.982
Look, this is a fascinating,

32:07.166 --> 32:09.940
terrifying idea, but we're not
anywhere near ready to go there.

32:10.127 --> 32:11.502
Well, my dad is.

32:13.117 --> 32:15.512
I have absolutely no idea
how we would extrapolate

32:15.625 --> 32:19.202
from an accidental poisoning
over months to a single injection now.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.283
Work with me, Simon.
We'll figure it out.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.290
Okay, supposing we do.
How do we test it?

32:24.876 --> 32:25.881
On my dad.

32:27.177 --> 32:29.901
- Right. I believe that's against the law.
- It is.

32:30.017 --> 32:31.372
I'll take care of that part.

32:31.485 --> 32:34.310
- Yeah, but we'd be accessories.
- What are you? Scientists or lawyers?

32:34.365 --> 32:38.871
- Well we're certainly not murderers.
- Yes, okay, yes, he could die.

32:39.497 --> 32:42.852
But, if he doesn't,
he'll get a few good, sane years!

32:43.007 --> 32:46.591
Which is a hell of a lot better than
ten years fucked up with Alzheimer's.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.722
He might die within a month.
Or a week.

32:51.066 --> 32:52.901
You prepared
to do that to your father?

33:01.298 --> 33:04.842
So, in two hours, you are
going to be over the ocean.

33:05.045 --> 33:09.171
I'll be at Heathrow by 8:30.
Back in the lab by nine.

33:09.338 --> 33:10.813
Will that give you
enough time en route

33:10.956 --> 33:13.632
to ponder the ethics of injecting
David's dad with prions.

33:13.895 --> 33:17.331
No. I think I'm just going
to help him figure out how to do that.

33:17.497 --> 33:19.453
Let him worry
about the quandary.

33:20.246 --> 33:21.171
Call me.

33:21.985 --> 33:23.793
- I will.
- Good.

33:24.288 --> 33:26.692
And remember,
if you change your mind,

33:27.466 --> 33:29.511
my lab could always do with a brilliant,

33:29.955 --> 33:32.923
beautiful, bioinformatician.

33:33.375 --> 33:34.630
I'll remember.

33:49.916 --> 33:50.990
Bye.

33:52.168 --> 33:53.382
Bye.

34:07.826 --> 34:09.750
Of course,
I'll make sure I pass that along.

34:10.824 --> 34:12.909
The two Guardsmen
who were unaccounted for,

34:13.005 --> 34:15.822
apparently they went on a hiking trip
last week. They still haven't returned.

34:15.936 --> 34:16.702
Okay.

34:16.937 --> 34:19.322
I want to talk to you.
In my office.

34:20.728 --> 34:21.580
Of course.

34:21.676 --> 34:23.760
Caroline, I'm going home.
I'll be on my cell.

34:23.908 --> 34:24.891
David!

34:28.938 --> 34:32.331
<i>All the Guardsmen have Lethargica
located at 11P43 on the genome.</i>

34:32.437 --> 34:36.322
<i>11P43 has always been a benign
piece of junk DNA. Now it's Lethargica?</i>

34:36.465 --> 34:38.263
Yeah, but the good news
is it's not contagious, David.

34:38.366 --> 34:40.592
But the '20's strain
was extremely contagious.

34:40.728 --> 34:43.183
I think that's the point one percent
difference from the frozen sample.

34:43.277 --> 34:46.592
Bob, if it's not contagious
how did it spread between 30 Guardsmen?

34:46.907 --> 34:49.973
- This is good news?
- And the bad news is that

34:50.136 --> 34:52.732
we all have Lethargica at 11P43.

34:52.888 --> 34:53.699
What?

34:53.926 --> 34:56.830
I checked the blood I took
from all of us, ran the DNA.

34:57.327 --> 34:59.020
- We all have it.
- But it's dormant.

34:59.166 --> 35:01.430
It's what's intrinsic in
the human genome? Has Jill seen this?

35:01.576 --> 35:03.711
I don't know, I haven't seen her.
But David I think you're wrong.

35:03.828 --> 35:07.212
- About what?
- The question isn't how it spread.

35:08.296 --> 35:10.772
The question is: What woke it up?

35:12.378 --> 35:13.723
You're right.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.600
Or who woke it up.

35:16.276 --> 35:19.022
And are they planning
on waking it up in all of us?

35:19.455 --> 35:20.492
Shit!

35:22.867 --> 35:24.731
Caroline, I'm going home.
I'll be on my cell.

35:37.917 --> 35:39.151
Who'd you call?

35:39.756 --> 35:41.183
- When? What call?
- Yesterday.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.712
I asked you to follow up on Henshaw.
You made a call.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.492
- Just calling one of my usual sources.
- And who is it?

35:48.897 --> 35:50.671
Caroline, what's going on?
I don't understand why you're--

35:50.728 --> 35:52.480
Who's your source, Wes?

35:56.726 --> 35:58.251
General Coffey.

36:00.195 --> 36:01.701
Who is General Coffey?

36:02.436 --> 36:04.691
He's my contact at Homeland Security.

36:05.136 --> 36:06.670
What did he say about Henshaw?

36:11.045 --> 36:12.421
He told me...

36:12.515 --> 36:14.873
that a truck crossed
the median and hit him head-on.

36:15.918 --> 36:17.261
And that he's dead.

36:19.897 --> 36:21.910
You led us to believe
you were still looking for him.

36:22.006 --> 36:23.812
Why in hell didn't you
tell us he was dead?

36:23.887 --> 36:26.832
- I was instructed not to.
- Why?

36:29.057 --> 36:31.692
I was told that
it's a matter of National Security.

36:33.617 --> 36:35.513
Caroline, what would you have done?

36:37.705 --> 36:40.312
NorBAC works
with Homeland Security, Wes.

36:40.458 --> 36:41.911
Did you tell him that?

36:50.587 --> 36:53.780
I'm sorry
you were put in that position.

36:56.678 --> 36:58.470
Thank you for understanding.

37:00.207 --> 37:01.690
Go back to work.

37:04.997 --> 37:06.810
Oh. And Wes...

37:09.047 --> 37:10.881
if this happens again,

37:11.217 --> 37:12.480
you can talk to me.

37:21.068 --> 37:22.852
You got a second
for some really bad news?

37:22.997 --> 37:25.453
Me first. Henshaw's dead.

37:31.095 --> 37:33.843
It's been days.
Where are all the samples we asked for?

37:34.325 --> 37:37.172
Would you like me to spend a couple
hours racing around, tracking them?

37:37.456 --> 37:39.182
Come on, Caroline.
I have other things to do.

37:39.366 --> 37:41.911
Like mass-producing
your miracle cure, I hope.

37:43.927 --> 37:45.141
What are you talking about?

37:45.307 --> 37:48.392
<i>Encephalitis Lethargica
is in everybody's DNA, McGuinn.</i>

37:48.546 --> 37:50.533
Yours, mine, the President's.

37:50.796 --> 37:53.122
- So what do you want from me?
- Answers Conner.

37:53.425 --> 37:55.171
We need to figure out
who's behind this.

37:55.276 --> 37:57.180
And you need to get the antiretroviral

37:57.295 --> 38:00.250
to as many vaccine labs as
you can, as fast as you can.

38:00.395 --> 38:03.361
<i>And we need to stop whoever
found a way to wake Lethargica up.</i>

38:03.476 --> 38:06.722
I told you before, Homeland Security
will track down the culprit.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.673
- I'm doing everything I can.
- Bullshit!

38:08.788 --> 38:10.441
Why don't you just tell us
what's going on!

38:18.938 --> 38:20.503
Jill!

38:21.145 --> 38:21.932
Hey.

38:22.206 --> 38:24.882
Up here. You seen Jill?

38:31.927 --> 38:34.561
<i>Hi, you've reached Jill.
After the message, leave a beep.</i>

38:35.875 --> 38:38.391
You're not here, you're not there.
Things are going fucking crazy

38:38.556 --> 38:41.063
and you're like, AWOL.
Where the hell are you? Call me.

39:18.307 --> 39:19.742
What happened?

39:20.738 --> 39:22.992
Her landlord called the lab.

39:23.107 --> 39:25.532
He said he found water
coming from under her door.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.132
She's in a coma.

39:31.726 --> 39:32.870
What they say?

39:34.068 --> 39:36.732
It's not looking good.
Her GCS is 8.

39:37.297 --> 39:38.860
English, Carlos.

39:39.325 --> 39:40.993
Glasgow Coma Scale.

39:41.455 --> 39:43.723
Eyes are 2, verbal is 2,

39:44.648 --> 39:48.073
Motor is 4.
4 is pretty good, but the 2's are...

39:49.278 --> 39:51.652
- disappointing.
- What are they trying?

39:52.496 --> 39:54.162
Combinations of drugs:

39:54.307 --> 39:56.552
D4T, 3TC.

39:56.877 --> 39:58.400
NVP.

40:02.717 --> 40:06.112
I'm going to take some blood
and get started working on her.

40:49.255 --> 40:50.993
What's it look like?

40:51.565 --> 40:53.672
Jill's blood. It's deja vu.

40:54.225 --> 40:55.522
11P43.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.382
30 Guardsmen in Ohio,
now Jill comes down with the same thing.

41:03.476 --> 41:04.803
What the fuck is going on?

41:06.585 --> 41:09.951
I need to find out how this retrovirus
got reactivated in the Guardsmen.

41:10.037 --> 41:11.931
I need to know what they ate,
what they breathed, what they drank,

41:12.027 --> 41:13.703
if they were given any medication.
Everything!

41:13.796 --> 41:15.131
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get right on it.

41:15.266 --> 41:17.041
Okay. Bob. What made Jill sick?

41:17.188 --> 41:19.610
You absolutely sure
this fucker isn't contagious?

41:20.076 --> 41:21.462
Then give me
another explanation.

41:21.626 --> 41:24.192
Look, Jill was in
quarantine two weeks ago.

41:25.147 --> 41:26.253
Her stem cells.

41:26.386 --> 41:28.481
I'm going to systematically
go through her lab books.

41:28.707 --> 41:30.043
Looking for every possibility.

41:30.135 --> 41:32.201
And the impossibilities, too.

41:32.708 --> 41:33.993
Good, Bob.

41:36.858 --> 41:38.720
- Did you call McGuinn?
- I've been calling.

41:38.888 --> 41:41.853
Wes has been calling.
He was supposed to update us today.

41:42.045 --> 41:44.052
- I'm going to Ohio.
- I'll go with you.

41:44.165 --> 41:45.651
- No, you need to stay here.
- Why?

41:45.767 --> 41:47.271
Because the lab needs you
and Jill needs you.

41:47.388 --> 41:50.140
I don't want you getting into
a "head-on with a truck".

41:50.505 --> 41:53.181
I won't, David.
I'll come back with the anti-retroviral.

41:53.995 --> 41:55.121
Good luck.

41:58.757 --> 42:00.371
I was just about to knock.

42:06.497 --> 42:09.022
- What a day!
- Yeah, mine's been a real treat too.

42:09.178 --> 42:10.683
What the fuck
are you doing here?

42:13.727 --> 42:15.761
- Thank you, Connor.
- Don't thank me yet.

42:16.178 --> 42:17.923
The Guardsmen
had dramatic recoveries.

42:18.198 --> 42:20.762
Within 24 hours
they were walking and talking.

42:21.158 --> 42:23.040
Then they started to get sick again.

42:23.146 --> 42:26.490
Turns out there's a secondary
virus, Phase II they're calling it,

42:27.045 --> 42:29.493
- and this one's even worse.
- What does it do?

42:30.017 --> 42:31.950
All their veins
and arteries swell up.

42:32.047 --> 42:34.083
Could it be a reaction
to the anti-retroviral?

42:34.508 --> 42:35.830
They ruled that out.

42:36.417 --> 42:38.501
Did they put them
back on the anti-retroviral?

42:38.636 --> 42:41.220
- No effect.
- What are your doctors recommending?

42:43.928 --> 42:45.991
So the decision is ours?

42:47.095 --> 42:50.050
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to tell you.

42:53.325 --> 42:54.991
If this doesn't work...

42:56.186 --> 42:57.583
then Jill's dead.

43:04.237 --> 43:06.332
Room 217 code blue. 217.

43:06.896 --> 43:09.203
Jill? No pulse. Starting CPR.

43:09.827 --> 43:12.110
One, 2, 3, 4, 5.

43:14.975 --> 43:16.371
One, 2, 3, 4, 5.

43:17.085 --> 43:19.531
- Get the atropine, 1 milligram push.
- 1 milligram.

43:19.836 --> 43:23.052
- One, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Atropine's in.

43:23.257 --> 43:25.610
One, 2, 3, 4, 5.

43:26.295 --> 43:28.190
Atropine's in.

43:31.128 --> 43:33.420
One, 2, 3, 4, 5.

43:34.735 --> 43:36.111
Charge it to 200 joules.

43:37.397 --> 43:38.130
200.

43:39.535 --> 43:40.190
Clear.

43:43.917 --> 43:44.720
300.

43:46.128 --> 43:46.793
Clear.

43:51.925 --> 43:53.070
- 360.
- 360.

43:53.168 --> 43:54.102
Clear.

43:57.175 --> 43:58.612
<i>Dans le prochain épisode :  *</i>

43:59.105 --> 44:01.500
Jill's lab books.
The retrovirus that she sequenced

44:01.658 --> 44:05.272
<i>in her stem cells, is Lethargica.
Same as the Guardsmen.</i>

44:06.657 --> 44:09.742
- That's a hell of a coincidence.
- That's no coincidence.

44:10.016 --> 44:11.790
I got 12,000 sick troops.

44:11.957 --> 44:13.953
In a few minutes I have to make
a recommendation to the President.

44:14.038 --> 44:16.123
I need to know if NorBAC
is anywhere near a cure.

44:16.217 --> 44:17.293
- No.
- Within a week?

44:17.387 --> 44:18.750
We're doing everything
we can, Connor.

44:19.598 --> 44:20.623
What is it David!

44:20.718 --> 44:23.993
Lethargica retrovirus in the
human genome, where is it again?

44:24.336 --> 44:25.573
11P43.

44:26.148 --> 44:28.081
- Fuck.
- What?

44:30.806 --> 44:32.721
- That's Jill's handwriting.
- I know, Bob.

44:32.805 --> 44:35.902
It's what she copied down from the
Manford brothers' board in Chicago, look!

44:36.115 --> 44:39.280
I need a copy of everything
that's on Wes' computer.

44:41.028 --> 44:42.603
Is anything wrong?

44:42.857 --> 44:44.133
I don't know.

44:46.825 --> 44:49.613
Something occurred to me in New York.

44:49.825 --> 44:50.950
Which is...

44:51.157 --> 44:53.451
When we talk or even when I just...

44:54.357 --> 44:55.840
see you at work.

44:56.977 --> 44:58.752
It's like everything I need.

45:00.856 --> 45:02.543
You just wake up, now, okay?

45:05.298 --> 45:07.343
I've got a hunch I'd like to follow up.

45:07.556 --> 45:10.792
I'll be sending out this week's
mission to all field agents online,

45:11.005 --> 45:13.392
and I don't think
I can trust anyone else with it.

45:13.595 --> 45:15.893
Remember,
only you know the whole story.
