WEBVTT

00:06.339 --> 00:09.240
Naomi Wildman, state
your purpose here.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.436
l was waiting for you.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.773
Kadis- Kot, remember?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.143
Our weekly game?

00:14.214 --> 00:15.579
Reschedule for tomorrow.

00:15.648 --> 00:17.047
l'm working now.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.675
Redecorating isn't work.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.379
Aesthetics are irrelevant.

00:20.453 --> 00:21.920
l'm modifying the alcove

00:21.988 --> 00:25.924
to function as a cortical
processing subunit.

00:25.992 --> 00:27.789
That was my next guess.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.591
Then l won't need to
explain its purpose.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.426
Okay, you win.

00:32.499 --> 00:35.332
What do you do with
the cortical processing, uh...

00:35.435 --> 00:36.834
Subunit.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.497
On Borg vessels, there's
one in each unimatrix.

00:39.606 --> 00:42.370
lt downloads newly assimilated
data to the drones.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.740
But Voyager isn't a Borg vessel,

00:44.811 --> 00:47.006
and you're not a drone anymore.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.344
Voyager collects
a great deal of information- -

00:49.416 --> 00:51.611
sensor scans,
navigational projections,

00:51.684 --> 00:52.844
engineering updates,

00:52.919 --> 00:55.979
away team reports,
scientific analyses.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.318
The results of our

00:57.390 --> 00:58.516
Kadis- Kot tournament?

00:59.592 --> 01:00.616
That, too.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.558
The crew must read and study
this information- -

01:02.629 --> 01:04.096
an inefficient procedure.

01:04.164 --> 01:07.133
These data nodes are downloading
the information into the alcove.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.260
Which is going to download it
into you.

01:11.504 --> 01:12.664
Precisely.

01:12.772 --> 01:14.637
ln a matter of hours,
l will assimilate

01:14.707 --> 01:16.231
several months worth of data.

01:16.342 --> 01:17.900
Can l try it sometime?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.844
Your physiology is...
different from mine.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.110
Guess l'll stick
to reading my lessons

01:24.184 --> 01:26.345
and listening
to Neelix tell stories.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.943
l will see you tomorrow.

01:28.054 --> 01:29.351
Can l watch?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.222
Okay, tomorrow.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.893 --> 03:49.555
Warning. Plate is hot.

03:49.629 --> 03:50.755
Now you tell me.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.923
You go for authenticity
and what do you get?

03:52.999 --> 03:54.125
Second- degree burns.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.863
l've been slaving over that
replicator program for hours.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.166
What was this bizarre
rumor l heard

04:00.240 --> 04:03.209
about half the crew on
Deck 5 getting pregnant?

04:03.276 --> 04:04.743
Oh, that.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.143
The Doctor was running
generational projections

04:07.213 --> 04:09.010
on the Sick Bay computer.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.107
Tom Paris happened
to glance at the monitor

04:11.184 --> 04:12.879
and jumped to conclusions.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.886
Wasn't long before
Neelix was asking me

04:14.954 --> 04:16.887
if he could turn Cargo Bay 1
into a nursery.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.490
Word travels fast
on this ship, hmm?

04:18.558 --> 04:20.526
Warp 10.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.756
Oh, by the way,
l meant to tell you...

04:23.830 --> 04:26.458
there's a class- K nebula
25 light- years off starboard.

04:26.532 --> 04:27.692
We should take a look.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.793
A major detour
for a minor nebula.

04:30.903 --> 04:34.236
We are explorers, remember?

04:34.307 --> 04:35.865
Permission granted.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.269
Main course,

04:38.344 --> 04:40.369
a recipe l've never tried.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.710
But we are explorers, remember?

04:44.250 --> 04:47.617
Regeneration cycle complete.

04:52.759 --> 04:55.956
Seven of Nine
to Lieutenant Torres.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.224
Lieutenant Torres, respond.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.697
Good morning, Seven.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.028
This better be important.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.432
l must speak with you at once.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.809
l'm picking up some interesting
graviton fluctuations

05:12.879 --> 05:14.278
about ten light- years away.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.575
Can you be more specific?

05:15.648 --> 05:16.706
Not at this distance.

05:16.783 --> 05:17.807
Tom...

05:17.884 --> 05:18.873
alter course.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.384
l want to take
a closer look.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.081
Chakotay had his heart set
on that nebula we're headed for.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.181
He'll have to wait.

05:25.258 --> 05:29.388
Captain, l need permission
to shut down the sensor grid.

05:29.462 --> 05:33.262
Seven thinks a couple of insects
are disrupting the power flow.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.595
A mating pair

05:34.701 --> 05:36.464
of photonic fleas,
to be more accurate

05:36.569 --> 05:37.900
and possibly their offspring.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.938
And how did you arrive
at this theory?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.804
Last night,
l downloaded six months

05:42.875 --> 05:44.342
of ship status reports

05:44.410 --> 05:46.935
into my new cortical subunit
while l was regenerating.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.604
Learn while you sleep.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.376
l tried that once- - 
gave me a headache.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.781
Go on.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.944
Eight weeks ago,
an away team encountered

05:54.020 --> 05:56.818
a Kartelan freighter carrying
supplies from Sector 492,

05:56.889 --> 05:59.790
a territory that included
a former Talaxian colony.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.759
Mr. Neelix used the opportunity

06:01.861 --> 06:04.056
to acquire 12 kilograms
of amber spice- -

06:04.097 --> 06:06.088
a delicacy among his people.

06:06.165 --> 06:08.065
What does that have to do
with the sensor grid?

06:08.167 --> 06:09.828
On the same day,

06:09.936 --> 06:12.598
Ensign Kim was repairing
a replicator in the Mess Hall.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.570
l remember that- - 
Neelix told me

06:14.640 --> 06:17.074
to stick around
to try something he was cooking.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.043
No doubt made
with the amber spice,

06:19.112 --> 06:20.602
which contained the larvae

06:20.680 --> 06:21.806
of the photonic fleas.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.246
How could you possibly
know that?

06:23.316 --> 06:27.116
Because l also downloaded data
regarding their life cycles.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.051
The larvae flew out
of the spice jar

06:29.122 --> 06:31.556
in search of their
primary source of nourishment- -

06:31.624 --> 06:33.057
plasma particles.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.253
The conduits within
the nearby sensor grid

06:35.328 --> 06:37.694
contain an unlimited supply
of these particles.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.494
Ensign Kim had unwittingly
given the creatures access

06:40.566 --> 06:41.999
by exposing the grid.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.898
The now mature creatures
periodically

06:44.003 --> 06:45.800
tap into the conduit
for nourishment.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.497
When they do,
the sensor emitters

06:47.607 --> 06:49.302
momentarily
lose their resolution.

06:49.375 --> 06:52.503
A logical, though
highly speculative, analysis.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.271
Let's find a more
suitable home for them.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.552
l'm picking up
graviton fluctuations.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.814
Take us out of warp.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.685
On screen.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.891
Anybody want to hazard a guess?

07:44.030 --> 07:45.725
They are hailing us.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.390
On screen.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.763
l recommend maximum shielding.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.101
There are a few technical issues
l haven't worked out yet.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.664
There's a massive graviton surge
coming from that thing.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.243
Shields to full.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.347
Your apparatus appears
to be destabilizing.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.112
lf l don't find a way to repair
this power core, they'll be able

08:06.185 --> 08:08.346
to see the explosion
all the way to, uh...

08:08.421 --> 08:09.945
Where did you say you were from?

08:11.090 --> 08:14.150
l didn't... but we're
from a planet called Earth.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.320
All the way to... Earth.

08:16.395 --> 08:18.386
Can we ask you
what it's supposed to do?

08:18.464 --> 08:21.558
Catapult a vessel across space
in the time it takes to say

08:21.667 --> 08:23.328
''catapult a vessel
across space.''

08:23.436 --> 08:25.904
lt'll make warp drive
look like a wooden sled.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.406
Maybe we can help you
with that power core.

08:31.477 --> 08:33.001
Hmm?

08:33.078 --> 08:35.013
The core sends a graviton surge

08:35.081 --> 08:36.673
through the projectors

08:36.749 --> 08:38.717
which locks onto a ship

08:38.784 --> 08:41.480
and sends it hurtling
into null space

08:41.554 --> 08:45.251
to emerge a few hours later,
hundreds if not thousands

08:45.324 --> 08:47.189
of light- years away.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.854
l'm curious
why you built this catapult.

08:49.929 --> 08:53.558
Simple- - l've been looking
for a way to get home.

08:53.633 --> 08:54.861
We know the feeling.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.128
l'd been exploring

08:56.235 --> 08:57.566
an unstable wormhole.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.262
Before l knew it, l was here

08:59.372 --> 09:01.033
and my home planet was there.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.769
l was facing a journey
of at least ten years.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.107
lnstead, l decided
to build a catapult.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.770
Have you tested it yet?

09:07.847 --> 09:09.041
Two weeks ago,

09:09.115 --> 09:11.583
l sent a probe
nearly 600 light- years,

09:11.651 --> 09:13.812
but it destabilized
the core.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.410
l've been trying to
fix it ever since.

09:15.488 --> 09:19.015
We can send an engineering team
over to help you.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.456
No, no, it's too dangerous.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.153
l wouldn't send my own crew
in there.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.627
Then we could find
a way to adjust

09:23.696 --> 09:24.822
the core reaction from here.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.194
A few well- timed
graviton pulses

09:26.265 --> 09:27.789
from our deflector dish
might do it.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.391
That's generous,

09:29.502 --> 09:31.436
but l have nothing
to give in return.

09:31.504 --> 09:35.031
We're not asking
for anything in return.

09:35.141 --> 09:38.133
You could use the catapult
after l've made my jump.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.973
lt should still
be functional.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.479
A thousand light- years

09:41.547 --> 09:43.777
won't exactly get
you back to Earth...

09:43.849 --> 09:46.511
But it would cut a few
years off our trip.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.679
lf you're successful,
and if l'm satisfied

09:48.754 --> 09:50.381
a jump would be safe
for Voyager,

09:50.456 --> 09:52.890
then we'll take you up
on that offer. Thank you.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.960
Let's get started.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.136
Come in.

10:39.338 --> 10:40.532
Good morning.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.005
Perhaps not.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.110
The alien, Mr. Tash,
is trying to deceive us.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.145
His catapult is the same type
of technology

10:47.213 --> 10:48.737
that was used to trap Voyager

10:48.814 --> 10:50.645
in the Delta Quadrant
five years ago.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.151
l scanned the
catapult myself.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.750
Sensors didn't pick up
anything unusual.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.728
You spent the night
in your new alcove.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.094
Processing
the same information

11:06.165 --> 11:09.066
and cross- referencing it
with Voyager's database.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.136
When the catapult
destabilized yesterday,

11:11.203 --> 11:12.636
astrometric sensors recorded

11:12.705 --> 11:14.639
a momentary burst
of epsilon radiation.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.335
Unusual, but not unheard of.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.877
Epsilon radiation is

11:18.978 --> 11:21.538
one the byproducts
of a tetryon reactor.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.741
According to your own entries
in the database,

11:23.816 --> 11:26.114
your only encounter
with that kind of technology

11:26.185 --> 11:27.277
occurred five years ago

11:27.353 --> 11:28.752
in the Alpha Quadrant.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.311
A coherent tetryon beam

11:30.389 --> 11:32.823
locked onto Voyager,
and you were hit by a massive

11:32.892 --> 11:34.792
displacement wave,
which pulled you across

11:34.860 --> 11:36.760
70,000 light- years
in a matter of minutes.

11:36.829 --> 11:41.163
The source of that tetryon beam
was the Caretaker's Array.

11:41.233 --> 11:44.168
Mr. Tash claims that his
catapult will be able to do

11:44.236 --> 11:45.897
something very similar.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.668
He didn't want us
to send over a repair team.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.406
Out of concern
for our safety.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.380
lt's obvious he was
trying to hide

11:56.449 --> 11:57.609
his tetryon reactor.

11:59.618 --> 12:01.245
The first time we met
a Caretaker,

12:01.353 --> 12:03.583
we were pulled
halfway across the galaxy.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.420
The second time
we were almost killed.

12:06.492 --> 12:09.655
l'm not eager for a third round.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.823
ls this any way
to treat a colleague?

12:12.898 --> 12:15.992
Not so much as a molecule
of Caretaker DNA.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.730
Thank you, Doctor.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.898
There's a tetryon reactor
powering your catapult.

12:22.074 --> 12:26.135
You didn't want us
to find it, did you?

12:26.212 --> 12:29.648
Unless you answer my questions,
l'll resume course,

12:29.715 --> 12:32.445
and you can ask
somebody else for help.

12:32.518 --> 12:36.147
Look, l acquired the tetryon
reactor at great cost.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.554
This territory is
full of species

12:38.624 --> 12:42.287
who would do anything for
such advanced technology,

12:42.361 --> 12:43.828
including steal it.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.962
l apologize for the deception,

12:47.032 --> 12:48.829
but you do understand.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.865
We made an agreement
to cooperate.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.964
l see no reason
not to continue.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.575
Thank you, Captain.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.770
Keep me informed
on your progress.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.643
That reactor had
to come from somewhere.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.273
l can't just ignore
the possibility

13:04.350 --> 13:05.647
of a Caretaker nearby.

13:05.718 --> 13:06.685
Keep scanning.

13:06.752 --> 13:07.810
See what you can find.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.377
There is another
possibility.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.355
The reactor may have come
from the same Array

13:11.423 --> 13:13.288
that brought Voyager
to the Delta Quadrant.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.986
That's a long shot, Seven.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.152
Maybe not.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.128
Again, according to your
own reports, you believed

13:18.197 --> 13:19.562
the only way
to keep the Array

13:19.632 --> 13:21.725
from falling
into the wrong hands

13:21.801 --> 13:22.893
was to destroy it.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.126
lt's possible

13:24.236 --> 13:26.067
the destruction
was incomplete.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.938
And one of the reactors
survived?

13:30.042 --> 13:31.942
We scanned for debris.

13:32.077 --> 13:35.911
There was nothing left but some
fused pieces of metal alloy.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.347
l wish to reexamine the sensor
records from that event.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.850
ln case we were mistaken.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.045
Yes.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.350
Go right ahead.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.754
Computer,
describe the debris remaining

13:45.825 --> 13:47.952
after the Array was destroyed.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.552
Particulate dust
and metallic fragments

13:50.629 --> 13:52.961
composed of an unknown alloy,

13:53.032 --> 13:56.195
vapor composed of hydrogen,
helium, mercury and argon.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.862
Was there anything left
of the tetryon reactor?

13:58.971 --> 14:00.199
Negative.

14:00.272 --> 14:03.969
Specify the yield
of the tricobalt device.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.375
20,000 teracochranes.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.242
Who programmed the device?

14:08.314 --> 14:09.440
Commander Tuvok.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.416
Display the detonation.

14:13.619 --> 14:18.056
Advance the image
by .01 seconds.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.522
Again.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.291
lsolate grid 3- 7 and magnify.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.526
ls that a tractor beam?

14:28.634 --> 14:30.431
lnsufficient sensor data.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.935
ldentify its source.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.472
lnsufficient sensor data.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.102
ldentify the isolated section
of the Array.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.941
Secondary power core.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.641
Which contained
a tetryon reactor.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.810
Affirmative.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.951
Commander, l've been
reviewing the data

14:54.093 --> 14:56.653
on the destruction
of the Caretaker's Array.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.630
Unfortunately, the sensor
records are incomplete.

14:59.698 --> 15:00.687
l don't doubt it.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.699
We were being attacked
by the Kazon.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.668
Half the ship's
systems were down.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.669
A single Kazon vessel.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.229
Armed to the teeth.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.399
Commander, you fired
the tricobalt charge

15:10.509 --> 15:11.771
that destroyed the Array.

15:11.844 --> 15:12.776
Correct.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.244
Under the Captain's orders?

15:14.313 --> 15:17.339
Did you also program
the charge?

15:17.416 --> 15:18.747
Yes.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.512
Under the Captain's orders
as well?

15:20.586 --> 15:21.746
Not directly.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.981
l determined the yield.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.683
20,000 teracochranes.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.884
That's correct.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.755
According to sensor estimates

15:28.827 --> 15:31.523
of the Array's hull integrity,
a charge of half that yield

15:31.597 --> 15:33.292
would have been
sufficient.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.562
The Captain wanted nothing left
for the Kazon to use.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.832
l calculated a yield
certain to produce that result.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.873
Something may have
escaped the blast- -

15:41.941 --> 15:43.431
one of the tetryon reactors.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.510
But we scanned for debris.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.172
The charge you detonated
tore an opening in subspace.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.648
And that's where
the reactor went?

15:51.717 --> 15:52.945
Yes.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.882
How?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.252
lt was pushed there
by a tractor beam.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.722
Do you have evidence

15:58.791 --> 16:00.850
of a tractor beam?

16:00.926 --> 16:02.416
Perhaps.

16:02.494 --> 16:05.292
Speculation is not evidence.

16:05.364 --> 16:06.956
There was no tractor beam,

16:07.032 --> 16:10.126
because there was no ship
in the vicinity to generate one,

16:10.235 --> 16:12.203
unless you can prove otherwise.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.398
Thank you, Commander.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.263
Looking for a midnight snack?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.524
l require information.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.724
l'm attempting to determine

16:40.799 --> 16:42.130
whether the
catapult technology

16:42.234 --> 16:43.895
was derived from
the Caretaker's Array.

16:44.036 --> 16:44.900
So l heard.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.198
A fascinating theory.

16:47.306 --> 16:49.274
lt's got my mind spinning.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.241
How long were you
in the vicinity of the Array

16:51.310 --> 16:52.538
before Voyager arrived?

16:52.611 --> 16:53.578
About a year.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.704
Kes was on a nearby planet

16:55.781 --> 16:58.716
and, uh, we were
getting very close.

16:58.784 --> 16:59.944
Did you ever encounter

17:00.019 --> 17:01.350
the Caretaker directly?

17:01.420 --> 17:02.819
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:02.888 --> 17:05.685
ln my opinion, any being
powerful enough to grab ships

17:05.758 --> 17:08.488
from the other side
of the galaxy should be avoided.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.050
According to
Voyager's database,

17:10.128 --> 17:11.357
he claimed he was searching

17:11.430 --> 17:13.021
for a genetically
compatible mate.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.656
Did you believe
that explanation?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.223
l had no reason to doubt it,

17:17.336 --> 17:20.396
though it did seem
a bit excessive.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.564
l mean, all those ships.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.867
What happened to them?

17:22.941 --> 17:24.568
Well, after he sampled
the crew's DNA,

17:24.643 --> 17:26.234
he sent them back
where they came from

17:26.310 --> 17:27.436
l suppose.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.878
You know, Kes always thought

17:29.014 --> 17:32.006
something more was going on,

17:32.084 --> 17:34.780
but she had
quite an imagination.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.048
Were there any other ships
in the area

17:37.122 --> 17:38.453
after Voyager arrived?

17:38.524 --> 17:39.456
Only the Kazon.

17:39.525 --> 17:40.617
But the Caretaker

17:40.692 --> 17:41.989
could have pulled in

17:42.061 --> 17:44.325
another vessel...
a cloaked ship, perhaps.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.057
Seven, what are you getting at?

17:46.131 --> 17:47.223
A third ship hidden

17:47.299 --> 17:48.823
from both Voyager and the Kazon.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.734
What was it doing there?

17:51.837 --> 17:55.034
Preventing the tetryon reactor
from being destroyed.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.234
Kes was right.

17:57.309 --> 18:00.642
Something was going on.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.942
Voyager's sensor logs were
damaged in the Kazon attack.

18:03.015 --> 18:03.982
l can't be certain.

18:04.049 --> 18:07.041
Maybe l can help.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.746
The sensor records
off my ship

18:08.821 --> 18:09.913
weren't damaged.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.455
l can give them to you.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.545
The tetryon reaction is stable.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.483
Graviton field is set
for a 100 light- year jump.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.486
The catapult's locking on
to him.

18:42.554 --> 18:43.885
We're being hailed.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.321
On screen.

18:45.390 --> 18:49.690
l'll contact you the moment
l reenter normal space.

18:49.761 --> 18:50.989
Thank you, Captain.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.690
My pleasure.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.061
Catapult is at full power.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.760
Good- bye to you all.

18:57.402 --> 19:00.303
Final launch sequence
has been initiated.

19:11.750 --> 19:12.808
He's gone.

19:12.951 --> 19:14.680
How long before we can expect

19:14.753 --> 19:16.015
to hear from him?

19:16.088 --> 19:18.522
lf his vessel survived,
one or two hours.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.557
Seven of Nine

19:19.625 --> 19:21.149
to Commander Chakotay.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.454
Go ahead.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.827
l require your assistance
in the Astrometrics Lab.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.798
On my way.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.837
Computer, seal the doors.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.373
Deactivate all sensors
within this room.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.407
Acknowledged.

19:36.475 --> 19:37.840
What's this about?

19:37.910 --> 19:40.743
l believe Voyager's presence
in the Delta Quadrant

19:40.812 --> 19:42.177
is no accident.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.841
You and the crew have been
stranded here intentionally.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.851
By whom?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.750
Captain Janeway.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.555
The Captain and Tuvok
were involved

19:54.626 --> 19:56.093
in a Federation conspiracy.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.391
They're in collusion
with the Caretaker

19:58.463 --> 20:00.090
and possibly
the Cardassians.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.792
l see.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.529
And the point
of this conspiracy?

20:04.636 --> 20:06.297
l believe
they're attempting to establish

20:06.405 --> 20:08.168
a military presence
in the Delta Quadrant.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.571
That's quite a theory.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.506
Perhaps you haven't heard
of the Jankata Accord.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.670
''No species shall
enter another Quadrant

20:13.745 --> 20:15.940
for the purpose
of territorial expansion.''

20:16.048 --> 20:18.778
The Federation signed it,
the Cardassians signed it,

20:18.850 --> 20:22.081
and Captain Janeway would be
the last person to violate it.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.485
lmprobable as it may sound,

20:23.555 --> 20:25.682
l've found compelling evidence

20:25.757 --> 20:27.281
to support my theory.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.122
What kind of evidence?

20:29.194 --> 20:32.163
l've analyzed over 30 million
teraquads of data

20:32.231 --> 20:33.664
regarding Voyager's
activities

20:33.732 --> 20:34.960
over the past five years.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.466
lt's quite clear

20:36.568 --> 20:39.002
that we've been the victim
of an elaborate deception.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.935
l don't have the benefit
of a cortical processor.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.475
Why don't you give me
the abridged version?

20:44.576 --> 20:46.976
ln the months
before Voyager's arrival,

20:47.045 --> 20:48.842
Neelix recorded
the appearance

20:48.914 --> 20:51.041
of 52 vessels,
including this one.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.152
A Cardassian warship.

20:54.219 --> 20:57.017
A remarkable coincidence.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.919
Only days
before Voyager's arrival,

20:58.991 --> 21:01.687
the Cardassians were already
in the Delta Quadrant.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.626
The Caretaker was trying
to find a mate, remember?

21:04.663 --> 21:07.291
He was pulling ships
from all over the galaxy.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.527
l'm familiar
with the Caretaker's actions.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.195
ln each instance,
he would examine the crew's DNA

21:12.304 --> 21:14.465
and when he failed
to find a genetic match,

21:14.573 --> 21:17.098
he would release the vessel,
but in this instance,

21:17.209 --> 21:19.473
Neelix's sensors indicated
the ship vanished.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.875
Obviously, it was returned

21:20.946 --> 21:22.208
to the Alpha Quadrant.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.373
Why?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.416
You seem to have
all the answers.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.111
l believe the Cardassians
were sent back

21:27.185 --> 21:28.516
to deliver strategic information

21:28.587 --> 21:30.555
regarding the Delta Quadrant.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.748
Conjecture.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.085
Extrapolation.

21:33.158 --> 21:34.819
l can believe the Cardassians

21:34.893 --> 21:37.088
might be involved in this,
but not Starfleet.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.527
There are precedents

21:38.597 --> 21:41.327
for unauthorized missions
of this type, Commander.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.391
According
to the Federation database,

21:43.502 --> 21:45.970
the Maquis were victims
of several of them.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.238
All right,
you've got my attention.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.939
You said that Tuvok and
Captain Janeway were involved.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.275
Tell me how.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.781
At the same time

21:57.849 --> 21:59.783
the Cardassians were meeting
with the Caretaker,

21:59.851 --> 22:01.341
your Maquis vessel
was infiltrated

22:01.453 --> 22:03.045
with a Starfleet agent.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.214
Tuvok.

22:04.289 --> 22:05.881
Your navigator.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.117
He guided your ship

22:07.192 --> 22:09.387
to prearranged coordinates
in the Badlands,

22:09.461 --> 22:11.361
where the Caretaker
locked onto you.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.762
Once you were pulled
into the Delta Quadrant

22:13.832 --> 22:15.629
Tuvok could've
secretly transmitted

22:15.701 --> 22:17.635
final instructions
to the Caretaker.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.297
A short time later,
Captain Janeway guided Voyager

22:20.405 --> 22:21.565
to the same coordinates

22:21.673 --> 22:23.937
and was also pulled
into the Delta Quadrant.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.840
All of these events took place
within a matter of days.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.277
l find that suspicious.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.316
l'll admit, the timing seems
a little convenient,

22:31.383 --> 22:34.079
but that doesn't mean
there was a master plan.

22:34.152 --> 22:37.644
Why did the Captain
destroy the Array?

22:37.723 --> 22:40.658
So the Kazon couldn't use it
to attack the Ocampa.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.354
That's what she told the crew,
but l believe she intended

22:43.428 --> 22:45.362
to remain
in the Delta Quadrant all along.

22:45.430 --> 22:46.897
lf the Array
had remained intact,

22:46.965 --> 22:49.490
you and all the others
would have insisted on using it

22:49.601 --> 22:50.590
to return home.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.294
She was keeping it
from the Kazon.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.770
The Captain ordered
Commander Tuvok

22:54.840 --> 22:56.398
to destroy the Array.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.203
He fired
two tricobalt devices.

23:01.813 --> 23:04.111
Are those weapons
normally carried

23:04.182 --> 23:05.877
on Federation starships?

23:05.951 --> 23:07.111
No.

23:07.185 --> 23:09.653
Yet they were part
of Voyager's arsenal.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.653
Why?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.656
l can't explain that.

23:12.724 --> 23:13.986
l can.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.822
Neither phasers nor torpedoes

23:15.894 --> 23:18.089
are capable
of creating a tear in subspace.

23:18.163 --> 23:19.687
A tricobalt device is.

23:19.765 --> 23:23.633
As Tuvok detonated the device,
a cloaked ship locked on

23:23.735 --> 23:25.896
to one of the Array's
tetryon reactors

23:26.004 --> 23:26.936
and pushed it

23:27.072 --> 23:28.869
through the tear into subspace,

23:28.940 --> 23:30.635
protecting it from the blast,

23:30.709 --> 23:33.109
and hiding it
from Voyager's sensors...

23:33.178 --> 23:34.941
but the Captain and Tuvok knew

23:35.080 --> 23:36.707
exactly where it was going.

23:36.782 --> 23:38.340
Once Voyager left the area,

23:38.417 --> 23:40.647
the reactor was retrieved

23:40.719 --> 23:41.947
and began a similar journey

23:42.087 --> 23:43.554
carried by a series of vessels,

23:43.622 --> 23:45.783
until it was finally
delivered to Mr. Tash.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.690
Who used it
to build the catapult.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.557
He was waiting here for Voyager

23:50.629 --> 23:52.961
and for the final phase
of the mission.

23:53.064 --> 23:55.498
Which is what, exactly?

23:55.567 --> 23:57.535
l don't think
Captain Janeway is planning

23:57.602 --> 24:00.002
to use the catapult
to get Voyager closer to home.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.632
l think she's going to use it
to bring in more vessels

24:02.741 --> 24:04.504
from the Alpha Quadrant.

24:04.576 --> 24:05.975
lf l'm correct,

24:06.044 --> 24:08.205
this region of space
will soon be occupied

24:08.280 --> 24:10.510
by a Federation- Cardassian
invasion force.

24:10.582 --> 24:11.514
You've uncovered

24:11.583 --> 24:12.845
some interesting facts,

24:12.918 --> 24:15.216
but your interpretation
is farfetched.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.811
These are random incidents.

24:16.888 --> 24:19.322
Granted, some of them
are hard to explain,

24:19.391 --> 24:21.188
but there's no conspiracy here.

24:21.259 --> 24:24.786
Stardate 51008.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.990
Captain Janeway allows Kes
to leave Voyager.

24:27.065 --> 24:28.794
Neelix told me
that Kes had suspicions

24:28.867 --> 24:30.095
about the Caretaker.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.432
Was the Captain trying
to silence her?

24:32.537 --> 24:34.061
Stardate 51462.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.730
The Doctor's program
is transmitted

24:35.841 --> 24:36.808
to a Starfleet vessel

24:36.875 --> 24:38.672
on the outskirts
of the Alpha Quadrant- -

24:38.743 --> 24:40.210
an attempt by the Captain
to contact Earth,

24:40.312 --> 24:41.939
or a secret communiqué

24:42.080 --> 24:43.945
informing Starfleet
of her progress?

24:44.015 --> 24:46.176
Stardate 50984.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.481
Janeway forges an alliance
with the Borg.

24:48.553 --> 24:52.080
Stardate 517 62.
A cease- fire with the Hirogen.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.647
Stardate 52861.

24:53.725 --> 24:56.125
A non- aggression pact
with the Terkellian.

24:56.194 --> 24:58.754
She called each incident,
''diplomacy.''

24:58.830 --> 24:59.762
l believe she was trying

24:59.831 --> 25:01.822
to establish
a tactical infrastructure

25:01.967 --> 25:02.991
in the Delta Quadrant.

25:03.101 --> 25:04.227
Over the past five years,

25:04.336 --> 25:06.668
Captain Janeway
has altered course 263

25:06.738 --> 25:08.603
times
in the name of exploration.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.005
ln reality, she was mapping
the region and collecting

25:11.076 --> 25:12.134
strategic data regarding...

25:12.210 --> 25:13.404
l get the point.

25:13.478 --> 25:16.106
You still doubt my suspicions,

25:16.181 --> 25:18.581
but can you be certain
l'm wrong?

25:18.650 --> 25:20.277
Absolutely certain?

25:22.954 --> 25:24.012
No.

25:24.089 --> 25:25.613
Until you are,

25:25.690 --> 25:27.521
you mustn't allow
Captain Janeway

25:27.592 --> 25:29.560
to retain control
of the catapult.

25:40.171 --> 25:43.140
l'm picking up a transmission,
heavily distorted.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.469
He made it.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.670
Can you clear it up?

25:48.346 --> 25:49.643
Success, Captain- -

25:49.714 --> 25:51.477
5,000 light- years.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.484
Are you all right?

25:53.552 --> 25:56.043
A few systems overloaded- - 
nothing serious.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.954
l had to readjust my shields
during mid- flight- -

25:59.024 --> 26:00.514
almost lost my outer hull.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.855
l'm sending you
the modifications.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.826
My catapult is yours, Captain.

26:04.896 --> 26:05.863
Good luck.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.762
Get that data down to B'Elanna.

26:09.868 --> 26:10.766
Tell her

26:10.869 --> 26:12.097
to enhance our shields.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.535
So we're going ahead
with the jump?

26:14.606 --> 26:16.597
l want to run
a few more tests,

26:16.708 --> 26:18.005
launch some probes,

26:18.076 --> 26:20.101
but if it all checks out,
l see no reason not to.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.873
l've received

26:22.013 --> 26:23.002
the telemetry.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.912
l'll take it to Engineering.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.891
l want you to add
a .03 variance

26:34.025 --> 26:35.890
to these shield
modifications.

26:35.961 --> 26:37.724
That'll disrupt
the emitters.

26:37.796 --> 26:39.661
And you'll need
another six hours

26:39.731 --> 26:41.562
to get them back
on line, l know.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.567
Have you run this
by the Captain?

26:43.668 --> 26:44.726
No...

26:44.836 --> 26:46.394
and l'm not going to...

26:46.504 --> 26:48.768
not yet.

26:54.412 --> 26:55.674
She's pulling your leg.

26:55.747 --> 26:59.615
lt- it's got to be some kind
of Borg practical joke.

27:00.919 --> 27:02.011
She wasn't joking.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.179
A secret mission?

27:03.254 --> 27:05.688
Starfleet in league
with the Caretaker?

27:05.757 --> 27:07.554
lt's ridiculous.

27:09.694 --> 27:10.786
''Ridiculous''?

27:10.862 --> 27:12.693
Seven has some
compelling evidence.

27:12.764 --> 27:14.322
Well, then,
let's go to the Captain,

27:14.399 --> 27:15.331
get a straight answer.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.594
''Good morning, Kathryn.

27:16.701 --> 27:18.134
''All systems are operational.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.727
''The crew's in good health.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.066
''And by the way, is it true

27:21.172 --> 27:23.197
you've been lying
to us for five years?''

27:29.648 --> 27:32.242
l'm not prepared
to make that accusation,

27:32.317 --> 27:34.945
but l can't ignore
what l've heard, either.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.582
So, what do you suggest?

27:40.659 --> 27:43.457
l want you to delay
those shield modifications.

27:43.528 --> 27:46.622
That'll give me time
to check Seven's database,

27:46.698 --> 27:48.791
take a look
at the evidence myself.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.735
The Captain asked me
to work with you on the shields.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.568
That won't be
necessary, Ensign.

27:55.640 --> 27:56.937
Oh, l don't mind.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.135
Oh, you know how eager she is
to make that jump.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.438
Harry, we're fine here.

28:02.147 --> 28:03.239
''Too many cooks,'' Harry.

28:03.314 --> 28:04.576
You know how it is.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.879
We'll let you know
when we're done.

28:13.625 --> 28:16.219
Download complete.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.256
Seven of Nine
to Captain Janeway.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.527
Go ahead.

28:23.635 --> 28:26.604
l need to speak with you
in the Astrometrics Lab.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.797
l'm on my way.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.372
Computer, seal the door

28:34.446 --> 28:36.880
and deactivate internal sensors
to this room.

28:36.981 --> 28:37.879
Acknowledged.

28:37.982 --> 28:38.880
Seven?

28:39.017 --> 28:40.143
l believe Chakotay

28:40.218 --> 28:42.413
and other members
of your crew are involved

28:42.487 --> 28:43.886
in a conspiracy to resurrect

28:43.988 --> 28:45.080
the Maquis Rebellion.

28:45.156 --> 28:47.351
Did Chakotay put
you up to this?

28:47.425 --> 28:50.087
Voyager and the
Federation itself

28:50.161 --> 28:51.185
are in grave danger.

28:51.262 --> 28:52.354
Go on.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.193
l've concluded
that Chakotay intends

28:54.265 --> 28:56.256
to use the catapult
to launch attacks

28:56.334 --> 28:58.700
against Cardassian
and Federation starships.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.361
Chakotay gave up his allegiance

29:00.472 --> 29:02.099
to the Maquis a long time ago.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.572
What you're saying
makes no sense.

29:03.641 --> 29:04.573
lmprobable as it may sound,

29:04.642 --> 29:06.803
l found
compelling evidence

29:06.945 --> 29:09.209
to support my theory.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.976
ln the months
before Voyager's arrival,

29:12.050 --> 29:14.678
Neelix recorded
the sudden appearance

29:14.753 --> 29:17.347
of 52 vessels...
including this one.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.755
A Cardassian warship.

29:20.825 --> 29:23.123
l've analyzed the hull geometry
and warp signature.

29:23.194 --> 29:24.422
lt was one
of the same ships

29:24.496 --> 29:26.259
that were pursuing Chakotay
and his crew

29:26.331 --> 29:28.026
in the region known
as the Badlands.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.760
lt was pulled
into the Delta Quadrant

29:29.868 --> 29:31.631
by the Caretaker
during that engagement.

29:31.736 --> 29:33.260
According
to Federation records,

29:33.371 --> 29:35.839
that same Cardassian warship
was found destroyed

29:35.974 --> 29:37.032
in the Badlands.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.473
The investigation revealed

29:38.543 --> 29:40.340
that it was attacked
by the Maquis.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.106
l believe that for
some unknown reason

29:42.180 --> 29:43.579
the Caretaker had
sent this ship

29:43.648 --> 29:44.842
back to the Alpha Quadrant,

29:44.916 --> 29:47.146
and that Commander Chakotay
attacked the vessel

29:47.218 --> 29:49.015
before it could reach
its destination.

29:49.087 --> 29:50.520
He downloaded its computer core

29:50.588 --> 29:53.148
and discovered the presence
of the Caretaker's Array.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.215
He realized that the
Array could be used

29:55.293 --> 29:56.555
by the Maquis as a weapon

29:56.628 --> 29:58.596
to launch surprise attacks
against Cardassian

29:58.663 --> 29:59.721
and Starfleet vessels.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.701
Well, l commend you
for your imagination,

30:04.803 --> 30:07.533
but Tuvok was a spy
on Chakotay's ship.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.436
lf your theory were true,

30:09.507 --> 30:11.498
he would have
known about it.

30:11.609 --> 30:12.541
He does.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.771
Tuvok has been
collaborating

30:14.846 --> 30:16.643
with the Maquis resistance
all along.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.045
That's not possible, Seven.

30:18.116 --> 30:19.276
With Tuvok's assistance,

30:19.350 --> 30:20.612
Chakotay plotted a course

30:20.685 --> 30:22.380
toward the next
likely appearance

30:22.453 --> 30:24.284
of the Caretaker's
displacement wave

30:24.355 --> 30:25.822
offering his vessel as bait.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.187
His ploy almost succeeded,

30:27.258 --> 30:29.055
but the Caretaker was
more powerful

30:29.127 --> 30:30.151
than he anticipated.

30:30.228 --> 30:31.957
His crew was taken captive.

30:32.096 --> 30:34.496
A few days later,
Voyager arrived

30:34.566 --> 30:35.965
and facilitated their escape.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.557
Chakotay seized that opportunity

30:37.669 --> 30:40.194
to make one last attempt
to gain control of the Array,

30:40.305 --> 30:42.398
but, then, you gave the order
to destroy it.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.772
Circumstantial evidence- - 
not proof.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.312
Who carried out your order
to destroy the Array?

30:48.379 --> 30:49.311
Tuvok.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.574
Using what type
of technology?

30:50.648 --> 30:52.013
Tricobalt devices.

30:53.384 --> 30:55.978
He set the yield
to 20,000 teracochranes.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.022
lt was enough
to tear an opening

30:58.089 --> 30:59.021
in subspace.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.557
A cloaked ship locked on

31:00.658 --> 31:02.148
to one of the reactors,
protecting it

31:02.193 --> 31:04.821
from the blast and hiding it
from Voyager's sensors.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.158
The reactor was retrieved

31:06.231 --> 31:07.892
and carried
by a series of vessels,

31:07.999 --> 31:09.864
until it was delivered
to Mr. Tash,

31:09.968 --> 31:11.731
who was well- compensated
by Chakotay

31:11.836 --> 31:13.303
to build the catapult.

31:13.404 --> 31:16.737
He was waiting here for Voyager,
so Chakotay could complete

31:16.808 --> 31:19.868
the mission he was forced
to abandon five years ago.

31:21.279 --> 31:25.306
l'd be willing to consider
this theory of yours...

31:25.383 --> 31:28.819
if l didn't know Chakotay
as well as l do.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.345
There is no one on this ship
l trust more.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.950
What you've done here

31:36.060 --> 31:37.960
is build what we call
a house of cards.

31:38.096 --> 31:40.564
Stardate 48658.

31:40.632 --> 31:43.795
Commander Seska is revealed
to be a Cardassian spy.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.369
She defects to the Kazon

31:45.470 --> 31:48.132
and impregnates herself
with Chakotay's DNA.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.503
Was he unaware of the procedure,
as he claims,

31:50.575 --> 31:52.008
or were they working together

31:52.076 --> 31:54.374
to create a new Kazon sect
to capture Voyager?

31:54.445 --> 31:55.469
Stardate 49522.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.776
Chakotay recommends
establishing

31:57.849 --> 32:00.010
trade relations
with the Kolhari.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.383
Their technology uses
tetryon power cells.

32:02.453 --> 32:03.886
A simple diplomatic
overture,

32:03.988 --> 32:07.287
or was he seeking a source
of energy for the catapult?

32:07.358 --> 32:09.223
Stardate 4957 1...

32:21.372 --> 32:23.203
Seven.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.673
Naomi Wildman.

32:24.742 --> 32:25.766
Where are you going?

32:25.877 --> 32:27.469
That's not your concern.

32:27.545 --> 32:29.012
What's wrong?

32:30.915 --> 32:32.644
Your father was Ktarian.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.241
So?

32:34.319 --> 32:36.844
The Ktarians were officially
with the Federation,

32:36.921 --> 32:38.855
but they sympathized
with the Maquis.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.550
What are you talking about?

32:40.625 --> 32:42.957
Who are you working for,
Chakotay or the Captain?

32:43.061 --> 32:44.585
Seven...

32:44.662 --> 32:46.220
Tell them it's too late.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.264
Go!

32:58.343 --> 33:02.177
l picked up a power surge
coming from the Cargo Bay.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.180
l detected the same thing.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.206
You think it's the
enhanced alcove?

33:06.284 --> 33:07.410
Could be.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.645
Let's take a look.

33:10.688 --> 33:13.885
Are phasers standard
equipment on board now?

33:13.958 --> 33:16.222
Must be.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.888
The data buffer's
been activated.

33:18.963 --> 33:20.225
l wanted to make sure

33:20.298 --> 33:21.890
it wasn't malfunctioning.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.399
Well, you should be careful.

33:23.501 --> 33:27.096
Somebody might think you were
trying to delete a few files.

33:27.205 --> 33:30.174
Why would they think that?

33:30.274 --> 33:32.435
Some of those files
could contain

33:32.510 --> 33:33.943
sensitive information.

33:34.045 --> 33:36.479
lf that's true,
somebody might think

33:36.547 --> 33:39.038
you were trying to do
the same thing.

33:39.117 --> 33:41.210
That catapult out there- -

33:41.285 --> 33:44.254
it's a powerful piece
of technology.

33:44.322 --> 33:48.554
lf the Maquis ever had access
to something like it,

33:48.626 --> 33:51.094
they might
have been successful.

33:51.162 --> 33:54.325
And if we had, your mission
to the Delta Quadrant

33:54.399 --> 33:56.731
never would have gotten
off the drawing board.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.563
What are you talking about?

33:58.669 --> 34:00.193
The mission you've been on

34:00.304 --> 34:01.931
for the last five years.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.066
My only mission
is trying to get Voyager home.

34:05.176 --> 34:06.700
Seven showed me
the sensor records.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.072
l saw the tractor beam.

34:08.146 --> 34:09.806
She showed me the same thing,

34:09.880 --> 34:11.974
but she implicated you

34:12.050 --> 34:14.280
in some kind of Maquis plot.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.422
Same evidence.

34:20.491 --> 34:23.221
Two different theories.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.888
lt all started
with those damn photonic fleas.

34:25.996 --> 34:28.431
She was downloading
Voyager's database...

34:28.498 --> 34:30.023
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.226
Go ahead, Harry.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.599
l just picked up
an unauthorized launch

34:33.704 --> 34:34.795
of the Delta Flyer.

34:34.906 --> 34:35.895
Seven's at the helm.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.268
Set a pursuit course.

34:37.341 --> 34:38.433
Acknowledged.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.737
Chakotay to the Doctor.

34:39.811 --> 34:40.937
Sick Bay here.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.206
Get down to Cargo Bay 2.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.940
Run a diagnostic
on Seven's alcove.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.072
On my way.

34:45.149 --> 34:46.547
l'm glad we got that settled.

34:46.617 --> 34:47.549
Likewise.

34:47.618 --> 34:48.777
Chakotay...

34:48.853 --> 34:51.447
let's keep this one
out of our logs, huh?

34:51.522 --> 34:52.648
Gladly.

35:09.540 --> 35:12.600
She's altering course,
heading for the catapult.

35:12.677 --> 35:13.871
Maintain pursuit.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.207
Open a channel.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.644
No response.

35:16.714 --> 35:17.874
Try to beam her out.

35:17.982 --> 35:20.746
She's done something to
alter her bio- signature.

35:20.818 --> 35:21.876
l can't get a lock.

35:22.019 --> 35:24.214
Target her propulsion
and weapons.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.846
Fire.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.161
Our targeting scanners
are out of alignment.

35:34.232 --> 35:35.256
She must have done it

35:35.333 --> 35:36.459
before she took off.

35:36.534 --> 35:37.558
She's charging weapons.

35:37.668 --> 35:38.726
Keep trying.

35:38.836 --> 35:40.167
Doctor to Captain Janeway.

35:40.238 --> 35:41.796
Report.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.773
Seven downloaded too much data
into her cortical implant.

35:44.842 --> 35:45.866
She's trying to make sense

35:45.977 --> 35:47.706
of more information
than she can process.

35:47.778 --> 35:48.904
Understood.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.210
Beam me onto the Delta Flyer.

35:51.282 --> 35:52.909
l'm going with you.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.952
No, l have a better chance
of getting through to her alone.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.782
This isn't part of
your mission, is it?

35:57.855 --> 35:59.379
ls it part of yours?

36:00.591 --> 36:01.819
Good luck.

36:01.893 --> 36:02.985
Energize.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.899
Captain.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.607
You came here
hoping to stop me.

36:16.707 --> 36:17.799
You'll fail.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.035
Turn this ship around.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.236
That's an order.

36:20.311 --> 36:22.370
Your orders are irrelevant.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.880
l'm no longer
under your command.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.244
You deceived me.

36:26.317 --> 36:27.841
There is no conspiracy.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.887
There is no Maquis rebellion.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.751
The Federation isn't
planning to invade

36:32.823 --> 36:34.120
the Delta Quadrant.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.523
l realize that,

36:35.593 --> 36:38.323
because l finally uncovered
your true objective.

36:38.396 --> 36:39.658
And what's that?

36:40.698 --> 36:41.960
Me.

36:43.501 --> 36:44.559
Stardate 3261 1.

36:44.669 --> 36:46.899
The Federation
sends my parents

36:47.071 --> 36:48.299
to study the Borg collective.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.704
They know my family
will be assimilated.

36:50.775 --> 36:52.504
That was their intention.

36:52.577 --> 36:53.737
Stardate 48317.

36:53.811 --> 36:55.540
Voyager is sent
to the Delta Quadrant

36:55.613 --> 36:56.807
with orders to retrieve me.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.439
When they reach Borg space,

36:58.516 --> 37:01.508
Captain Janeway negotiates
an alliance with the collective

37:01.619 --> 37:03.052
in exchange for information

37:03.087 --> 37:04.952
regarding Species 8472.

37:05.022 --> 37:08.185
They agree to give her
Seven of Nine.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.727
Stardate 51030.

37:10.795 --> 37:13.025
Janeway extracts
the implants from my body

37:13.097 --> 37:16.692
to remove any knowledge l have
of her agreement with the Borg.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.234
Stardate 53329.

37:18.302 --> 37:21.100
Captain Janeway finalizes plans
to use the catapult

37:21.172 --> 37:23.663
to deliver Seven of Nine
to the Alpha Quadrant,

37:23.774 --> 37:26.538
where Starfleet will dissect
and analyze the drone

37:26.611 --> 37:28.875
to gather tactical data
to fight the Borg.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.880
l won't allow you
to complete your mission.

37:30.982 --> 37:34.509
lf necessary,
l'll destroy the catapult

37:34.585 --> 37:35.711
and myself.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.582
You're right, Seven.

37:40.658 --> 37:43.718
There is a conspiracy here,

37:43.794 --> 37:48.197
but l believe
it's a conspiracy of one.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.861
l've got a theory of my own.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.334
Your modified alcove

37:53.404 --> 37:56.134
threw your synaptic
patterns into chaos,

37:56.207 --> 37:58.232
and your mind
can't make sense

37:58.342 --> 38:01.436
of all the information,
so you're generating

38:01.545 --> 38:02.637
theory after theory

38:02.680 --> 38:04.807
in an attempt to bring
order to that chaos.

38:04.915 --> 38:06.041
Your reasoning is flawed.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.709
My alcove
is functioning perfectly.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.582
What about you?

38:09.654 --> 38:11.281
You're not a drone anymore.

38:11.355 --> 38:12.822
You can't always predict

38:12.923 --> 38:16.518
how Borg technology
will affect you.

38:16.594 --> 38:17.959
You should be in Sick Bay,

38:18.029 --> 38:20.122
not behind that force field.

38:20.197 --> 38:21.323
Let me help you.

38:21.399 --> 38:22.832
No.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.628
l don't believe you.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.327
Of course you don't.

38:26.437 --> 38:29.873
Anything l say gets woven into
your paranoid conspiracies,

38:29.974 --> 38:31.874
but you should believe me,
Seven,

38:31.976 --> 38:34.877
because l've never lied to you.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.776
And l'm not lying to you now.

38:36.847 --> 38:40.374
You have to put
your doubts aside

38:40.451 --> 38:42.976
and trust me.

38:43.054 --> 38:47.491
Stardate 51030.

38:47.558 --> 38:50.356
Seven of Nine is severed
from the hive mind.

38:50.428 --> 38:52.896
The Captain tells
her not to resist,

38:52.997 --> 38:54.225
that she'll learn

38:54.298 --> 38:55.856
to accept her humanity.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.493
Seven complies

38:58.602 --> 39:01.571
and slowly begins
to embrace her individuality.

39:01.672 --> 39:06.200
Does she regret that decision?

39:06.277 --> 39:09.110
Stardate 51652.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.809
The Captain encourages Seven
to develop her social skills.

39:12.917 --> 39:16.182
Seven insists
it's a waste of time,

39:16.253 --> 39:18.414
but after further requests,
she pursues it

39:18.489 --> 39:22.687
and begins to develop her
first human friendships.

39:22.760 --> 39:26.196
Did Janeway lead her astray?

39:26.263 --> 39:29.824
Stardate 52840.

39:29.900 --> 39:34.462
The Captain orders Seven
to study her parents' journals.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.472
Seven claims
they're irrelevant,

39:36.540 --> 39:38.303
but eventually
she reads them

39:38.376 --> 39:40.674
and rediscovers part
of her own past.

39:40.745 --> 39:44.772
Stardate 52841.

39:44.849 --> 39:48.580
For the first time,

39:48.652 --> 39:52.782
Seven tells the Captain...
''thank you.''

39:57.661 --> 40:02.325
lt was Stardate 52842...

40:02.400 --> 40:06.461
0600 hours in the Mess Hall.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.595
We had just finished breakfast.

40:08.706 --> 40:11.641
My mistake.

40:11.709 --> 40:13.939
Stardate today.

40:14.044 --> 40:17.775
Janeway beams aboard
the Delta Flyer.

40:17.848 --> 40:21.579
She reminds Seven of the bond
that's grown between them.

40:21.652 --> 40:24.177
Seven lowers the force field

40:24.255 --> 40:26.951
and she decides to come home.

40:27.057 --> 40:30.652
All l'm asking

40:30.728 --> 40:33.322
is that you trust me again.

40:49.713 --> 40:51.977
Delta Flyer to Voyager.

40:52.049 --> 40:53.641
Two to beam out.

40:57.054 --> 40:58.646
Captain's Log, supplemental.

40:58.722 --> 41:01.691
After further testing,
we activated the catapult

41:01.792 --> 41:04.556
and were hurtled across
30 sectors of space.

41:04.595 --> 41:08.190
ln less than an hour, we cut
three years off our journey.

41:08.265 --> 41:09.857
l'm happy to say the Doctor

41:09.934 --> 41:12.198
has repaired Seven of Nine's
cortical processor,

41:12.303 --> 41:13.770
and she's returned to duty.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.203
Guess who assimilated

41:15.272 --> 41:17.832
three books and ten
reports in two days?

41:17.942 --> 41:19.102
Naomi Wildman.

41:19.176 --> 41:21.940
That's correct.

41:22.046 --> 41:24.276
Are you taking your
new alcove apart?

41:24.348 --> 41:25.440
Yes.

41:25.516 --> 41:26.608
Why?

41:26.684 --> 41:27.946
My attempt

41:28.052 --> 41:30.247
to download
Voyager's database failed.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.788
Maybe you can fix it.

41:31.856 --> 41:37.954
The alcove functioned
within expected parameters.

41:38.062 --> 41:39.996
Unfortunately, l did not.

41:42.399 --> 41:44.959
Three books and ten reports
is impressive,

41:45.102 --> 41:47.696
but quantity is less
relevant than quality.

41:47.805 --> 41:50.171
You must be able
to interpret the data

41:50.241 --> 41:52.232
and enjoy the process.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.838
Regardless,
you require activities

41:55.913 --> 41:58.643
other than assimilating
books and reports.

41:58.716 --> 42:01.241
A game of Kadis- Kot,
for example.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.649
When?

42:02.686 --> 42:05.120
Go to the Mess Hall
and set up the board.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.123
l'll join you when l'm finished.

42:12.596 --> 42:16.896
l heard the strangest
rumor today.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.525
Apparently, the Captain
and First Officer

42:19.637 --> 42:20.899
almost came to blows.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.596
Mutiny?

42:22.706 --> 42:25.504
First Officer walked the plank.

42:25.576 --> 42:26.804
So l heard.

42:30.047 --> 42:31.639
l don't believe a word of it.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.012
Me, neither.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.953
Seven was malfunctioning.

42:38.055 --> 42:40.046
We don't have that excuse.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.751
You're right.

42:41.825 --> 42:45.693
We've been through too much
to stop trusting each other.

42:49.667 --> 42:51.532
You didn't poison
the coffee, did you?

42:51.635 --> 42:54.001
Not any more than l usually do.
