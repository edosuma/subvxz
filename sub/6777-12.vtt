MR. WILLIMAN'S LAST STATEMENT
MAY BE OFFENSIVE.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.601
IT MAY CONTAIN
EXPLETIVES OR...

01:52.710 --> 01:55.201
MATTER OF A DARK NATURE.

01:55.310 --> 02:00.213
WHEN MR. WILLIMAN EXPIRES,
YOU MAY HEAR WHAT IS KNOWN AS

02:00.320 --> 02:04.142
A "DEATH RATI'LE," OR A SNORT
OR A COUGH OF SOME SORT.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.457
SOME FELLAS BLEED
FROM THE NOSE...

02:06.560 --> 02:09.358
IT'S NOT COMMON,
BUT IT HAPPENS.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.327
OR HE MAY JUST APPEAR
TO FALL OFF TO SLEEP

02:12.430 --> 02:14.318
WITH HIS EYES EITHER
OPEN OR CLOSED,

02:14.430 --> 02:16.318
IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.

02:16.430 --> 02:20.594
NOW, I'M SORRY IF THIS IS
TROUBLESOME TO YOU FOLKS,

02:20.700 --> 02:24.864
BUT IF, WHEN THIS IS
ALL OVER, YOU TELL ME,

02:24.970 --> 02:28.303
"OFFICER PADDOCK, IT HAPPENED
JUST LIKE YOU SAID IT WOULD,"

02:28.410 --> 02:31.106
THEN I FIGURE
I DID MY JOB.

02:31.210 --> 02:37.683
WE DON'T WANT
ANY SURPRISES.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.850
ANY QUESTIONS ?

02:40.960 --> 02:43.520
THERE'S
NO EXPLANATION.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.621
( laughing )

02:45.730 --> 02:51.362
THERE'S NO EXCUSE.

02:51.470 --> 02:54.667
I CAN'T LAY HERE
AND TELL YOU THERE IS ONE.

02:58.740 --> 03:02.005
BUT IF ANYBODY THINKS
THE STATE OF TEXAS

03:02.110 --> 03:06.046
IS TEACHING ANYBODY ANYTHING
BY PUTTING THIS POISON INTO ME,

03:06.150 --> 03:12.111
THEY'RE EVEN DUMBER
AND CRUELER THAN I AM.

03:12.220 --> 03:15.348
AND YOU'RE ALL GONNA CRY
IN THE SAME WET HELL

03:15.460 --> 03:18.520
THAT I'M GOING TO
FOR DOING THIS.

03:18.630 --> 03:22.225
YOU'RE GONNA EAT SHIT
AND VOMIT BLOOD, FOREVER.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.936
BECAUSE THIS
ISN'T RIGHT.

03:48.990 --> 03:52.892
YOU'RE ALL PIGS.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.663
YOU'RE ALL FUCKING PIGS
SLIPPING OUT OF GOD'S ASS.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.331
AND I WOULD CUT
ALL YOUR THROATS IF I COULD,

04:00.440 --> 04:03.762
I HATE THIS
MOTHERFUCKING--

04:04.670 --> 04:06.399
( groaning )

04:17.650 --> 04:20.881
( Brenda on answering machine )
Hey, Nate, it's Brenda again.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.049
If you're there,
pick up.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.856
You must be at work,
okay, well...

04:25.960 --> 04:29.088
If you want me to stop calling,
Nate, could you just tell me ?

04:29.200 --> 04:31.122
Otherwise,
I'll keep trying.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.936
I'm really worried--

04:49.120 --> 04:54.410
( female on radio )
At 89.9, the greater
Palm Springs area at 89.3.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.489
Oxnard, Ventura,
Carpinteria at 89.1,

04:57.590 --> 05:00.491
Lemon Grove at 89.9--

05:01.900 --> 05:04.425
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GET
THE PAPER EVERY DAY.

05:04.530 --> 05:07.567
NO, I KNOW, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE MONEY, IT'S...

05:07.670 --> 05:09.331
LOOK...

05:09.440 --> 05:11.533
WE DON'T CARE HOW FREE
YOU MAKE THE PAPER,

05:11.640 --> 05:13.403
WE DON'T WANT ALL THAT
PAPER IN THE APARTMENT.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.035
YES, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT DEAL OF SAVINGS--

05:16.140 --> 05:18.176
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.714
IS THERE COFFEE
FOR ME TOO ?

05:25.090 --> 05:26.216
WHAT THE-- ?

05:26.320 --> 05:27.753
WHAT WAS THAT ?

05:27.860 --> 05:29.953
I CAN'T STAND LISTENING TO YOU
DEAL WITH THOSE TELEMARKETERS,

05:30.060 --> 05:33.188
TRYING TO BE SO GODDAMN
NICE ABOUT EVERYTHING.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.154
IT'S LIKE NAILS
ON A CHALKBOARD.

05:35.260 --> 05:36.693
SHE WAS JUST TRYING
TO DO HER JOB.

05:36.800 --> 05:37.994
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO YOURS.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.465
AND I'M TRYING
TO DO MINE.

05:39.570 --> 05:42.539
THIS COFFEE
TASTES LIKE SHIT.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.766
KEITH ?

05:43.870 --> 05:44.859
WHAT ?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.779
CAN YOU HEAR THE TONE
IN YOUR VOICE ?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.233
DAVID, PLEASE, DON'T START
WITH ME ABOUT THAT AGAIN.

05:48.340 --> 05:49.409
NO, I'M SERIOUS !

05:49.510 --> 05:51.375
THERE IS NO TONE
IN MY VOICE.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.175
YES, THERE IS,
IT'S THE SAME TONE

05:53.280 --> 05:55.043
THAT YOU USED
DOWN IN SAN DIEGO.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.640
I AM SICK OF
TALKING ABOUT THAT--

05:56.750 --> 05:58.615
IT'S THE SAME TONE YOU USE
WHENEVER YOU WANT ME TO KNOW--

05:58.720 --> 06:00.312
DAVID, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET IT
THROUGH YOUR THICK FUCKING SKULL

06:00.420 --> 06:02.388
THAT YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO FUCKED UP IN SAN DIEGO !

06:02.490 --> 06:04.788
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN INVOLVED
IN MY FAMILY BUSINESS !

06:04.890 --> 06:06.152
I STUCK UP FOR YOU !

06:06.260 --> 06:07.796
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY
STICKING UP FOR ME !

06:07.900 --> 06:11.620
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TURN SHIT
AROUND AND MAKE IT ABOUT ME,

06:11.730 --> 06:14.164
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FACE THE FACT
THAT YOU WERE OUT OF LINE !

06:14.270 --> 06:16.295
BEING ON YOUR SIDE
IS OUT OF LINE ?

06:16.410 --> 06:17.866
WHEN I DON'T
WANT YOU ON IT, YEAH !

06:17.970 --> 06:19.506
SEE, THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME, KEITH.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.498
I WANT YOU
ON MY SIDE.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.339
I NEED YOU
ON MY SIDE.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.748
AND IT'S THE ONE THING
THAT I NEVER EVER HAVE !

06:25.850 --> 06:26.817
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.171
YES, IT IS,
BECAUSE EVERYTHING I DO

06:28.280 --> 06:30.783
IS TOO WEAK
OR TOO NICE, YOU--

06:35.990 --> 06:38.481
YOU'RE NOT FOR ME.

06:38.590 --> 06:41.525
I LOOK AT YOU, KEITH,
AND ALL I THINK ABOUT

06:41.630 --> 06:43.598
IS HOW I CAN HELP YOU BE
WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO BE

06:43.700 --> 06:45.565
BETWEEN NOW AND
THE DAY THAT YOU DIE.

06:45.670 --> 06:49.458
YOU LOOK AT ME AND ALL
YOU SEE ARE PROBLEMS !

06:49.570 --> 06:51.106
THAT'S NOT TRUE !

06:51.210 --> 06:52.472
I'M SO FUCKING
SICK OF IT !

06:52.580 --> 06:55.105
GOD, WHY SHOULD
I STAND FOR THIS ?

06:55.210 --> 06:57.747
WHY SHOULD THIS CONSTANT ABUSE
BE WHAT I CALL "LOVE" ?

06:57.850 --> 06:58.475
DAVID, DAVID--

06:58.580 --> 07:00.514
DON'T TOUCH ME !

07:06.050 --> 07:08.655
NOW REMEMBER, NOTHING TO EAT
OR DRINK AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.594
AND HAVE YOU ARRANGED
FOR A RIDE ?

07:12.700 --> 07:15.328
I WAS JUST GONNA
TAKE A CAB, I THOUGHT...

07:15.430 --> 07:17.489
YOU KNOW ?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.989
WE PREFER IT IF
A FAMILY MEMBER
TAKES YOU HOME.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.069
HMM, NOBODY IN MY FAMILY WOULD
WANT TO DO THAT, I DON'T THINK.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.808
ARE YOU SURE ?

07:24.910 --> 07:25.934
YEAH.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.942
DO YOU HAVE A FRIEND
WHO COULD HELP YOU ?

07:33.220 --> 07:35.017
NO.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.988
WELL, WE REALLY DON'T
WANT YOU TO DRIVE YOURSELF.

07:41.620 --> 07:45.249
THIS HAS BEEN THE LONGEST
MONTH OF MY WHOLE LIFE.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.588
I CAN IMAGINE.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.554
OH YEAH ?
GET THIS.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.867
I LOST MY JOB TO GO
TO MY FATHER'S EXECUTION.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.961
ISN'T THAT
THE MOST PATHETIC THING

07:53.070 --> 07:54.799
YOU'VE EVER HEARD
IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE ?

07:54.900 --> 07:58.609
MY STUPID BOSS TOLD ME
I SHOULDN'T EVEN GO, AND I DID.

07:58.710 --> 07:59.802
WHERE DID YOU WORK ?

07:59.910 --> 08:02.378
THIS USED CAR DEALERSHIP
OVER ON OLYMPIC.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.572
IT'S OKAY, I'LL GET
ANOTHER JOB,

08:03.680 --> 08:05.272
BUT IT'S JUST
SO DUMB.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.779
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.643
YEAH, AND NOW I'M OUT
OF A FUCKIN' JOB.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.548
THANYOU,
RIGHT THING.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.811
WORK CAN BE DIFFICULT

08:14.920 --> 08:16.626
WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.652
YOU DON'T KNOW.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.127
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
I'M OUT, LIKE $700

08:22.230 --> 08:26.997
BECAUSE I HAD TO PAY TO SHIP
HIS BODY BACK FROM TEXAS.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.008
MS. WILLIMAN, WILL YOU
BE WANTING A SERVICE

08:34.110 --> 08:35.771
FOR YOUR FATHER ?

08:35.880 --> 08:36.972
OR, IF YOU PREFER,
WE COULD JUST--

08:37.080 --> 08:39.048
NO, I WANT
A SERVICE FOR MY DAD.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.879
I TALKED TO FATHER JACK
ABOUT THAT.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.242
I THOUGHT
HE'D TALKED TO YOU.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.339
NO, HE DIDN'T.

08:43.450 --> 08:44.610
HE TOLD ME
HE DID.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.608
YEAH, HE DID, RICO.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.585
HE TALKED TO DAVID.

08:48.690 --> 08:49.884
I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.685
HE CALLED YESTERDAY
FROM SAINT BART'S.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.098
THAT'S MY CHURCH.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.294
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.632
I DON'T WANT THE FACT THAT
HE KILLED A BUNCH OF WOMEN

09:02.740 --> 09:06.232
TO BE THE ONLY STORY ANYBODY
EVER TELLS ABOUT HIM, YOU KNOW ?

09:06.340 --> 09:07.876
I MEAN, HE WAS
A KID ONCE.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.845
HE HAD A LIFE,
I'VE SEEN THE PICTURES.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.872
AND HE WASN'T
SUCH A BAD DAD.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.369
I MEAN MY BROTHER KINDA GOT
THE SHIT BEAT OUT OF HIM A LOT,

09:14.480 --> 09:16.038
BUT HE NEVER
BEAT ME.

09:16.150 --> 09:20.211
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
ONE MOMENT, MS. WILLIMAN,

09:20.320 --> 09:23.619
I'LL GO FIND
THE OTHER MR. FISHER

09:23.730 --> 09:26.085
AND WE'LL FIGURE
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.124
THANK YOU.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.776
I BET IF MY DAD
WASN'T A MURDERER,

09:39.880 --> 09:43.099
YOU'D BE SAYING ALL KINDS OF
SWEET THINGS TO ME RIGHT NOW,

09:43.210 --> 09:47.214
LIKE, HOW HARD THIS MUST BE
FOR ME, AND SHIT LIKE THAT.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.983
NO, I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR YOU, I'M SORRY, I JUST...

09:51.090 --> 09:54.651
I'VE BEEN HAVING
A HARD TIME MYSELF LATELY.

10:00.360 --> 10:04.399
SHOW ME WHAT THE CHOICES ARE
FOR THE BOX WHILE WE WAIT.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.365
OKAY.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.645
THEY'RE LITTLE PEOPLE.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.286
THEY FALL INTO
THE PIPE OVER HERE,

10:24.390 --> 10:26.187
THEN THEY GO DOWN
AND DOWN THROUGH THE PIPE,

10:26.290 --> 10:29.726
AND THEN THEY BREAK APART INTO
A BUNCH OF PIECES OVER HERE

10:29.830 --> 10:33.857
AND THEN
THEY DISAPPEAR. ..

10:35.800 --> 10:39.395
AND THEN SLOWLY,
VERY SLOWLY

10:39.500 --> 10:42.708
THEY GET PUT
BACK TOGETHER

10:42.810 --> 10:46.268
AND COME OUT
THE OTHER SIDE.

10:50.410 --> 10:53.470
SO, SHOW ME
THE BOXES.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.549
UH, YEAH, UH...

10:56.650 --> 11:01.258
THERE ARE A LOT OF AFFORDABLE
CHOICES IN HERE, SO DON'T WORRY,

11:01.360 --> 11:04.523
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SPEND A LOT.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.382
THAT'S GOOD,
'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LOT.

11:06.490 --> 11:09.152
LIKE, ALMOST NOTHING.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.791
UM, I TALKED TO DAVID.

11:13.900 --> 11:17.666
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
TAKEN CARE OF.

11:23.110 --> 11:24.998
I'VE MADE
STUFFED CABBAGE ROLLS.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.510
IF ANYBODY WANTS
SOME FOR DINNER,

11:27.620 --> 11:30.248
THEY'RE IN THE SKY-BLUE
TUPPERWARE.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.248
THAN KS.

11:31.350 --> 11:32.487
( Claire )
THANKS.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.285
IT'S SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL DAY, TODAY.

11:34.390 --> 11:37.188
I KNOW.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.997
( honking )

11:40.100 --> 11:41.453
OH DEAR.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.629
( David )
WHAT ?

11:42.730 --> 11:43.867
IT'S ONE OF LISA'S
DR. PEPPERS.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.995
LISA DOESN'T
DRINK DR. PEPPER.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.931
MAYBE NOT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.735
JUST PUT IT
BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.330
SOMEONE WILL
DRINK IT.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.542
I CAN'T LEAVE MAYA.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.538
WE'LL COME AND GET MAYA
IN A FEW WEEKS,

11:59.650 --> 12:01.072
AFTER EVERYTHING'S
COOLED DOWN.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.717
GOD, WHY DID I EVER
GET MYSELF INTO THIS ?

12:03.820 --> 12:05.344
YOU WANTED LOVE.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.884
AND HE MADE YOU BELIEVE
THAT HE COULD GIVE IT TO YOU.

12:07.990 --> 12:10.424
THAT'S WHAT NATE DOES,
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.781
HE'S TOXIC.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.699
YEAH, I SHOULD'VE BROUGHT
MAYA WITH ME, THOUGH.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.529
MAYA'S ON HER
OWN JOURNEY, LISA.

12:15.630 --> 12:18.667
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

12:18.770 --> 12:22.592
( rock music )

12:22.700 --> 12:24.964
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF SOMEONE
COULD TAKE HER TO THE PARK.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.379
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S IT.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.630
IF ANY OF YOU NEED ME,

12:29.740 --> 12:32.447
I'VE LEFT THE NUMBER
BY THE PHONE.

12:38.220 --> 12:41.109
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING TOMORROW ?

12:41.220 --> 12:43.984
SAME OLD SHIT.
SAME OLD CRAP.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.757
I'M BUSY.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.328
ME TOO, WHY ?

12:52.100 --> 12:53.397
NOTHING.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.468
WHERE'S MOM GOING ?

12:55.570 --> 12:58.004
GEORGE'S.
GEORGE'S.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.077
OH YEAH.

13:04.810 --> 13:07.176
"THE ORIGINAL TITLE
OF THIS FAMOUS POEM

13:07.280 --> 13:12.149
WAS HE DO THE POLICE
IN DIFFERENT VOICES."

13:18.490 --> 13:21.152
THE WASTE LAND.

13:21.260 --> 13:24.969
THAT IS A MUCH
BETTER TITLE.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.467
DUM DA DUM BA...

13:36.640 --> 13:38.642
WELL, WE'RE STILL
A GENIUS.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.808
EVEN WITH
ONE WRONG.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.447
I KNEW THAT
ALREADY.

13:59.730 --> 14:00.936
RUTH ?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.634
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.605
DO YOU...

14:05.710 --> 14:09.032
MOVE THIS FAST
WITH EVERYBODY ?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.368
NO.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.948
BUT THEN, I'VE NEVER MET ANYBODY
LIKE YOU BEFORE, GEORGE.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.075
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET AWAY.

14:15.180 --> 14:19.480
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.729
I GUESS I DO FEEL
LIKE THE STARS

14:24.830 --> 14:26.718
ARE MOVING A LITTLE
FASTER LATELY.

14:26.830 --> 14:30.789
YOU KNOW, LIKE IN THOSE MOVIES
WHERE THEY SPEED THINGS UP ?

14:30.900 --> 14:35.894
AND THE STARS STREAM
ACROSS THE SKY IN STRIPES,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.833
THEY'RE MOVING
SO FAST.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.579
DO-DO-DO-DO. ..

14:46.250 --> 14:49.139
BUT...

14:51.920 --> 14:54.480
BUT WHAT ?

14:54.590 --> 14:58.321
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW HAS BEEN
MISSING FOR OVER TWO WEEKS.

14:58.430 --> 15:01.490
MY GRANDDAUGHTER
MAY BE WITHOUT A MOTHER

15:01.600 --> 15:04.364
FOR THE REST
OF HER LIFE.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.768
I'M JUST...

15:06.870 --> 15:12.001
VERY AWARE OF HOW IMPORTANT IT
IS TO ENJOY WHAT LIFE GIVES YOU

15:12.110 --> 15:14.931
WHEN IT
GIVES IT TO YOU.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.439
WHO KNOWS, GEORGE ?

15:16.540 --> 15:20.442
YOU MAY BE MY LAST CHANCE
TO FINDING LOVE.

15:20.550 --> 15:24.816
AND YOU MAY BE
MY LAST CHANCE TO BE HAPPY.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.911
YOU'VE BEEN
HAPPY BEFORE.

15:27.020 --> 15:31.457
NOT LIKE THIS.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.361
( soft music )

15:46.440 --> 15:49.637
( phone )

15:52.610 --> 15:56.046
RUSSELL, STOP CALLING ME,
OR I'M GONNA CHANGE MY NUMBER.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.820
YOU ACTUALLY
HIT HIM ?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.693
NO, OF COURSE NOT,
I JUST...

16:14.800 --> 16:16.233
I SWATTED HIM AWAY,
KIND OF.

16:16.340 --> 16:19.559
SEE, I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU TWO STAY TOGETHER

16:19.670 --> 16:21.103
IF IT'S ALWAYS
THAT BAD.

16:21.210 --> 16:22.837
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
ALWAYS THAT BAD.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.749
YEAH, BUT EVEN IF IT'S THAT BAD
FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.842
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
ME AND VANESSA,

16:27.950 --> 16:31.181
WE'VE GOT THE KIDS
TO THINK ABOUT...

16:31.290 --> 16:33.952
SO, GAY COUPLES HAVE NO REASON
TO STAY TOGETHER ?

16:34.060 --> 16:35.516
NO, ALL I'M SAYING IS,
I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY

16:35.620 --> 16:37.986
STAYS TOGETHER
WITHOUT KIDS, THAT'S ALL.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.352
IT WAS A COMPLIMENT.

16:39.460 --> 16:42.554
IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE A COMPLIMENT.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.595
SOMETHING CHUNKY.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.839
A CLOT,
I DON'T KNOW.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.931
ALL GONE.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.302
HELLO, COMRADES.

16:54.410 --> 16:55.570
HI, ARTHUR.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.605
SO, THIS IS THE GENTLEMAN
WHO MURDERED ALL THOSE WOMEN.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.541
YEP.

17:01.650 --> 17:05.484
ONLY TO BE MURDERED HIMSELF
BY THE STATE OF TEXAS.

17:05.590 --> 17:09.014
SO, YOU'RE AGAINST
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, ARTHUR ?

17:09.120 --> 17:10.587
CERTAINLY.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.055
NOT ONLY DOES IT FAIL
TO DETER OTHER CRIMINALS, RICO,

17:12.160 --> 17:13.889
BUT MISTAKES
ARE OFTEN MADE.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.297
INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.958
AND INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE
BECAUSE OF GUYS LIKE HIM

17:17.070 --> 17:18.162
ALL THE TIME.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.669
WHAT DID
HE DO ANWVAY ?

17:19.770 --> 17:21.089
WELL, HE MADE ONE WOMAN
EAT BROKEN GLASS...

17:21.200 --> 17:22.428
NO, DON'T TELL ME.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.667
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN.

17:24.770 --> 17:26.169
WHY TALK ABOUT THEM ?

17:26.270 --> 17:27.339
( Arthur )
I AGREE.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.668
BUT RICO--

17:28.780 --> 17:30.645
LOOK, IF SOMEONE DID SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO VANESSA,

17:30.750 --> 17:32.945
OR EVEN TO YOU, I'D HAVE
NO TROUBLE FLIPPING THE SWITCH.

17:33.050 --> 17:34.938
AND WHAT ABOUT THE VALUE
OF HUMAN LIFE ?

17:35.050 --> 17:37.041
HE CASHED IN THE VALUE OF HIS
HUMAN LIFE A LONG TIME AGO.

17:37.150 --> 17:39.243
OKAY, HE'S
A FREAKING DORITO.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.853
CRUNCH HIM,
THEY'LL MAKE MORE.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.257
LORD.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.021
HEY.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.928
MAYA JUST WENT DOWN
FOR HER MORNING NAP.

17:48.030 --> 17:49.850
I'M GONNA HEAD OUT
FOR A QUICK RUN.

17:49.960 --> 17:50.927
WHO'S WATCHING HER ?

17:51.030 --> 17:52.361
CLAIRE.

17:54.870 --> 17:56.599
WHO'S THIS ?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.361
IT'S MR. WILLIMAN.

17:58.470 --> 17:59.835
REMEMBER ?

17:59.940 --> 18:01.032
WITH THE DAUGHTER ?

18:01.140 --> 18:03.074
SO, WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING ?

18:03.180 --> 18:04.738
HE CAME IN HERE ALREADY
EMBALMED, DIDN'T HE ?

18:04.850 --> 18:08.411
YEAH, WELL, HE LOOKED
LIKE A TANGERINE, ALRIGHT ?

18:08.520 --> 18:10.613
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A BETTER COLOR FOR HIM.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.712
I AGREE.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.915
( doorbell )

18:17.020 --> 18:20.126
OH, GOD, NOW WHAT ?

18:23.530 --> 18:24.963
HEY.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.389
HI.

18:26.500 --> 18:30.402
YOUR FATHER'S SERVICE
IS TOMORROW, RIGHT ?

18:30.510 --> 18:31.169
I KNOW.

18:31.270 --> 18:34.171
UM, I WANTED TO...

18:34.280 --> 18:36.908
TALK TO YOU
ABOUT FLOWERS.

18:37.010 --> 18:39.979
OH, WELL, WE'LL
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.672
IT'S PART OF
THE PACKAGE.

18:41.780 --> 18:46.183
BUT, I MEAN, WHAT KIND
OF FLOWERS DO YOU LIKE,

18:46.290 --> 18:52.479
OR DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD HAVE ?

18:52.590 --> 18:55.821
I ONLY ASK BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A MAN.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.069
WELL...

18:58.170 --> 19:00.968
WE HAVE A FLORIST WHO
DOES ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.

19:01.070 --> 19:04.198
IT'LL BE A NICE SELECTION,
A VARIETY.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.768
NOTHING PINK,
DON'T WORRY.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.371
OKAY.

19:12.550 --> 19:15.246
UM, DID YOU...

19:15.350 --> 19:18.945
WANNA GO GET SOME COFFEE
OR SOMETHING ?

19:19.050 --> 19:21.985
I HAVEN'T EATEN
ANYTHING YET TODAY.

19:22.090 --> 19:24.581
THANK YOU,
BUT I'M...

19:24.690 --> 19:28.296
I'M KINDA BUSY.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.919
IS YOUR WIFE AROUND ?

19:33.030 --> 19:35.260
NO, SHE'S NOT.

19:35.370 --> 19:37.634
LOOK, I THINK YOU
SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.833
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO GO OUT FOR A RUN.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.431
I'M SORRY.

19:42.540 --> 19:45.907
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SORRY.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.272
IT'S OKAY.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.745
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

19:48.850 --> 19:52.240
I DON'T HAVE A JOB,
I JUST SIT AROUND ALL DAY

19:52.350 --> 19:53.988
AND STARE AT
THE WALLS...

19:54.090 --> 19:55.910
IT'S OKAY.

19:57.960 --> 20:01.452
LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.825
IT'LL LOOK GREAT,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.797
NOTHING PINK.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.265
RIGHT, NOTHING PINK.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.701
THAN KS.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.152
GET THE CORDLESS.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.899
I KNOW, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.525
BUT THEN ONE DAY IT ISN'T
CHARGED UP, AND YOU NEED IT.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.497
THIS ONE HAS
MORE TORQUE.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.536
HOW MUCH TORQUE DOES A GUY
LIKE ME REALLY NEED, THOUGH ?

20:48.340 --> 20:50.137
THIS ONE FEELS GOOD
IN YOUR HAND.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.798
HERE, TRY IT.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.474
SEE WHAT I MEAN ?

20:54.580 --> 20:56.673
I DO.

20:58.850 --> 21:02.217
GEORGE, I WONDER IF
WE SHOULDN'T JUST GET MARRIED.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.185
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

21:04.290 --> 21:05.427
IAM.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.851
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
THINKING THE SAME THING.

21:07.960 --> 21:08.892
YOU HAVE ?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.297
YES !

21:10.400 --> 21:11.560
BECAUSE GEORGE, I DON'T MIND
TELLING YOU, I'M LONELY.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.399
AND I'VE BEEN LONELY
FOR A LONG TIME.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.297
AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS, 3--

21:15.400 --> 21:17.436
RUTH, I THINK...

21:17.540 --> 21:21.374
I THINK
IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.072
YOU REALLY DO ?

21:23.180 --> 21:24.499
YES.

21:24.610 --> 21:27.909
I DON'T WANT TO COME TO PLACES
LIKE THIS ALONE ANYMORE.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.045
NEITHER DO I.

21:30.150 --> 21:31.549
THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS,
ISN'T IT ?

21:31.650 --> 21:33.208
COMING TO PLACES
LIKE THIS.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.958
YES.

21:35.060 --> 21:35.958
IT'S AWFUL !

21:36.060 --> 21:37.550
I KNOW !

21:37.660 --> 21:40.697
SO, LET'S GET MARRIED,
WHAT THE HAY.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.927
I WANT TO,
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

21:43.030 --> 21:45.294
ME TOO.

21:59.110 --> 22:02.238
I'VE BEEN
MARRIED BEFORE.

22:02.350 --> 22:03.647
YOU SHOULD
KNOW THAT.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.014
WELL, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE
TWO GROWN CHILDREN.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.281
MORE THAN ONCE.

22:08.390 --> 22:10.950
HOW MANY TIMES ?

22:11.060 --> 22:13.324
SIX.

22:13.430 --> 22:16.297
I'M SORRY, I SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU BEFORE--

22:16.400 --> 22:19.460
NO, I'M GLAD
YOU DIDN'T.

22:31.410 --> 22:32.946
GET THE CORDLESS.

22:33.050 --> 22:36.838
I'LL HELP YOU MAKE SURE
IT STAYS CHARGED.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.941
IT'S A DEAL.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.066
EXCUSE ME.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.092
YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO SEE A DOG
DOWN ON THE BEACH, DID YOU ?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.997
NO, I'M SORRY.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.431
GOSH DARN IT.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.405
(Uw)
YOU LOST YOUR DOG ?

22:58.510 --> 22:59.329
( Williman )
NOT ME, MY WIFE.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.839
WHAT DOES
HE LOOK LIKE ?

23:00.940 --> 23:02.305
HE'S A CHOCOLATE LAB.

23:02.410 --> 23:03.445
YOU WANT TO SEE
HIS PICTURE ?

23:03.550 --> 23:05.177
NO, I DIDN'T
SEE HIM.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.874
SORRY, GOOD LUCK.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.389
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

23:25.500 --> 23:27.434
I'VE BEEN CALLING
AND CALLING.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.189
I WANTED TO KNOW
THAT YOU WERE OKAY.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.801
YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT !

23:30.910 --> 23:34.209
THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT YOU
OR I CAN DO ABOUT IT, IS THERE ?

23:34.310 --> 23:36.198
SO, THANKS ANYWAY.

23:36.310 --> 23:37.777
NATE, I'M TRYING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.213
I'M SORRY, WERE YOU THERE
THE NIGHT THAT YOU KISSED ME,

23:41.320 --> 23:42.844
OR WAS THAT
SOMEBODY ELSE ?

23:42.950 --> 23:44.486
DO YOU KNOW HOW
THAT MAKES ME FEEL,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ?

23:44.590 --> 23:45.648
MY WIFE'S GONE--

23:45.750 --> 23:47.786
I KNOW,
LISTEN, NATE.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.085
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
YOU MUST BE GOING THROUGH--

23:50.190 --> 23:53.125
YOU HAVE NO FUCKING CONCEPT OF
WHAT I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH !

23:53.230 --> 23:54.754
I HAVEN'T
SLEPT IN DAYS.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.623
I'VE BEEN UP TO
FUCKING GAVIOTA STATE BEACH

23:56.730 --> 23:58.322
FIVE TIMES THIS WEEK.

23:58.430 --> 24:01.137
I'VE BEEN DRIVING UP AND DOWN
FUCKING P-C-H PUTTING UP FLYERS

24:01.240 --> 24:03.094
ON GODDAMN
TELEPHONE POLES.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.428
THEN LET ME HELP YOU.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.599
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU
WANT TO HELP ME ?

24:06.710 --> 24:08.337
BECAUSE I CARE
ABOUT YOU, NATE.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.169
AND I CAN'T JUST
TURN IT OFF.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.805
SURE YOU CAN,
YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

24:14.050 --> 24:14.971
I'M SORRY.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.115
JUST GIVE HER TO ME.

24:16.220 --> 24:17.016
I COULDN'T
GET HER TO--

24:17.120 --> 24:18.815
JUST, THAN KS.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.367
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
GIVE ME A RIDE ?

24:34.470 --> 24:38.759
I HAVE TO GO
GET AN ABORTION.

24:38.870 --> 24:42.806
OH, SURE.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.678
IT'S SO GOOD YOU'VE KEPT UP
WITH THIS CHORUS OF YOURS.

24:46.780 --> 24:49.078
IT MUST BE A WONDERFUL
OUTLET FOR YOU.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.978
IT IS, IT'S, UH...

24:52.090 --> 24:53.580
WHAT ?

24:53.690 --> 24:56.750
WELL, THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDST

24:56.860 --> 24:58.885
OF ALL TH ESE VOICES
BEING CARRIED ALONG,

24:58.990 --> 25:01.595
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
GET TO THE END OF THE SONG.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.498
FOR A FEW MINUTES,
IT'S THAT SIMPLE,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.795
JUST GET TO THE END
OF THE SONG.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.164
THAT'S KIND
OF A RELIEF.

25:09.270 --> 25:11.135
FROM THE REST
OF LIFE.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.004
YES.

25:22.550 --> 25:25.519
I THINK
LISA'S DEAD.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.754
I DO TOO.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.748
I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT I DO.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.782
I JUST FEEL
LIKE SHE'S GONE.

25:32.890 --> 25:35.688
FOR A WHILE, I COULD
IMAGINE ALL KINDS OF THINGS...

25:35.800 --> 25:37.358
HER SHOWING UP...

25:37.460 --> 25:38.666
I KNOW.

25:38.770 --> 25:41.933
SHE WAS PART
OF OUR FAMILY.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.667
MAYA'S MY NIECE.

25:43.770 --> 25:45.965
AND SHE WAS SUCH
A SWEET PERSON.

25:46.070 --> 25:47.731
WHY SHOULD SOMETHING
LIKE THAT HAPPEN TO HER ?

25:47.840 --> 25:51.173
WHY IS LIFE
LIKE THAT ?

26:05.130 --> 26:07.052
THANKS FOR
THE TEA.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.299
DAVID ?

26:09.400 --> 26:11.368
YEAH ?

26:11.470 --> 26:13.836
I'VE BEEN
SEEING SOMEONE.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.295
GEORGE.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.492
YEAH, WE'VE NOTICED.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.861
IT'S GOING
PRETTY WELL.

26:18.970 --> 26:20.904
THAT'S GOOD, HE SEEMS
LIKE A NICE ENOUGH GUY.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.830
HE IS, I'VE...

26:22.940 --> 26:26.444
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING
MAYBE I COULD THINK ABOUT...

26:26.550 --> 26:29.018
EVEN SETTLING DOWN WITH HIM,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

26:29.120 --> 26:32.339
IT WOULD BE TIME,
MAYBE TO TRY THAT AGAIN ?

26:32.450 --> 26:36.250
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOU MEAN BY "SETTLING DOWN".

26:36.360 --> 26:37.952
WELL...

26:38.060 --> 26:39.584
GETTING MARRIED.

26:39.690 --> 26:42.591
DON'T YOU THINK
I DESERVE TO BE HAPPY ?!

26:42.700 --> 26:44.190
OF COURSE.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.790
BUT YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN THE GUY
FOR, WHAT, A COUPLE OF WEEKS ?

26:45.900 --> 26:47.390
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO RUSH INTO IT SO FAST ?

26:47.500 --> 26:52.108
BECAUSE WHEN I'M WITH HIM,
LIFE IS FULL OF POSSIBILITIES.

26:52.210 --> 26:55.702
AND I HAVEN'T FELT
THAT WAY IN SO LONG

26:55.810 --> 26:57.402
I HAD FORGOTTEN
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE,

26:57.510 --> 26:59.705
AND I DON'T WANT
TO FORGET THAT AGAIN.

26:59.810 --> 27:01.072
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

27:01.180 --> 27:02.875
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GET HURT...

27:02.980 --> 27:05.687
THAT'S ALL.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.391
( Claire )
SUSHI.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.728
LIKE WHAT ?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.934
LIKE SPICY TUNA
OR YELLOWTAIL.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.735
I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN IT GETS TOO BAROQUE.

27:25.840 --> 27:30.607
LIKE, THE FROZEN SPIDER ROLL
OF THE TEN THOUSAND SECRETS.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.348
YEAH, I DON'T
NEED THAT.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.338
ME NEITHER.

27:35.580 --> 27:37.616
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU LIKE ?

27:37.720 --> 27:41.656
I DON'T KNOW.

27:43.460 --> 27:48.659
( chorus singing )

27:48.760 --> 27:56.860
* BEAUTIFUL DREAMER,
WAKE UNTO ME *

27:56.970 --> 28:02.738
* STARLIGHT AND DEWDROPS
ARE WAITING FOR THEE *

28:02.840 --> 28:10.679
* SOUNDS OF THE RUDE WORLD
HEARD IN THE DAY *

28:10.790 --> 28:17.218
* LULLED BY THE MOONLIGHT
HAVE ALL PASSED AWAY *

28:18.430 --> 28:19.351
HEY, DAVID.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.348
HEY.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.429
DO YOU WANNA...

28:24.530 --> 28:25.622
GET SOMETHING ?

28:25.730 --> 28:27.493
LUNCH OR A DRINK
OR SOMETHING ?

28:27.600 --> 28:30.137
YES, PLEASE, GOD,
THANK YOU, YES.

28:38.150 --> 28:42.371
SUSAN, DENISE,
PAM, CLAIRE.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.787
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.312
I'LL BE HERE.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.272
MS. FISHER ?

29:15.380 --> 29:16.540
GOOD AFTERNOON.

29:16.650 --> 29:18.288
I'M DR. SIMPSON.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.584
HI.

29:19.690 --> 29:23.456
BEFORE WE BEGIN THE PROCEDURE,
I'M GONNA DO AN ULTRASOUND.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.438
YOU'LL FEEL
A LITTLE PRESSURE.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.462
IT WON'T BE
TOO UNCOMFORTABLE.

29:37.570 --> 29:42.178
( sighing )

29:52.790 --> 29:55.509
I SEE YOU
CHOSE TWILIGHT.

29:55.620 --> 29:58.157
I DON'T KNOW...

29:58.260 --> 29:59.784
SEDATION ?

29:59.890 --> 30:01.551
OH, YEAH.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.196
THAT'S TWILIGHT.

30:03.300 --> 30:07.361
YOU'RE NOT REALLY GONE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE.

30:07.470 --> 30:09.438
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

30:09.540 --> 30:12.202
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE OKAY.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.301
AMI?

30:14.410 --> 30:15.604
YES.

30:15.710 --> 30:17.871
I'M GOING TO TAKE
GOOD CARE OF YOU.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.005
DON'T WORRY.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.338
IT'S OKAY.

31:05.060 --> 31:06.721
ARE YOU HER RIDE ?

31:06.830 --> 31:07.751
YEAH.

31:07.860 --> 31:08.724
HERE'S SOME
INSTRUCTIONS.

31:08.830 --> 31:10.889
NO BATHS, NO TAMPONS.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.797
JUST MOTRIN, PADS,
AND SOME REST.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.788
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
BY TOMORROW.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.130
THAN KS.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.006
MARY, HAILEY,
BETHANY, ROSA.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.707
SO, WHAT DO
YOU THINK ?

31:24.810 --> 31:26.448
OH.

31:26.550 --> 31:30.213
I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL BOOK,
GEORGE, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.915
UNIVERSITY OF
MARYLAND PRESS.

31:34.020 --> 31:35.749
IT'S MY ALMA MATER.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.885
AND IT REALLY IS A WHOLE
DIFFERENT WAY OF SEEING THINGS.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.480
ISN'T IT ?

31:39.590 --> 31:41.751
I MEAN, TO ME,
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.896
BUT TO YOU,
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S...

31:44.000 --> 31:45.592
JUST STOPPING BY.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.463
YEAH.

31:50.100 --> 31:53.069
I'M INKING WE SHOULD SLOW DOWN
ON THE MARRIAGE PLANS, GEORGE.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.638
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE
TO CHANGE, BUT...

31:55.740 --> 31:57.605
WOULD THAT BE
OKAY WITH YOU ?

31:57.710 --> 31:59.439
I KNOW I MUST
SEEM CONFUSED.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.871
IT'S ONLY
BECAUSE I AM.

32:01.980 --> 32:06.679
RUTH, I'M HERE
IF YOU WANT ME.

32:06.790 --> 32:10.089
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROSPECTS
AND I DON'T WANT ANY.

32:10.190 --> 32:13.921
SO, THERE'S NO RUSH.

32:14.030 --> 32:18.296
THANK YOU.

32:23.340 --> 32:26.503
WHY ISN'T THERE A PICTURE
OF YOU ON THE BACK ?

32:26.610 --> 32:27.929
I DIDN'T WANT ONE.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.600
IT'S ABOUT ROCKS,
NOT ME.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.071
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
IT OUGHTTA BE THE END.

32:37.180 --> 32:41.458
I'M SO TIRED OF HAVING THE SAME
FIGHT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.152
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN ?

32:43.260 --> 32:45.478
I HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

32:47.190 --> 32:50.398
I'M SO BORED WITH
THIS KIND OF UNHAPPINESS.

32:50.500 --> 32:55.096
I THINK I'M READY FOR
SOME NEW UNHAPPINESS.

32:56.800 --> 33:01.032
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS
I COULD SAY, BUT...

33:01.140 --> 33:03.631
GO AHEAD,
SAY THEM.

33:03.740 --> 33:06.345
NO, I...

33:06.450 --> 33:09.419
WHAT ?

33:11.350 --> 33:12.647
SAY IT.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.854
I...

33:14.960 --> 33:16.689
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...

33:16.790 --> 33:18.519
MORE THAN ANYTHING,
DAVID...

33:18.630 --> 33:21.554
THAT I TAKE YOU AND YOUR
SITUATION WITH KEITH

33:21.660 --> 33:22.991
REALLY SERIOUSLY.

33:23.100 --> 33:26.922
AND IF YOU CAN BE
HAPPY WITH KEITH,

33:27.030 --> 33:29.066
I WANT YOU TO BE.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.559
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING ?

33:31.670 --> 33:34.639
I DO.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.549
THANK YOU.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.638
( soft music )

34:16.850 --> 34:17.771
HEY.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.983
HOW ARE YOU
FEELING ?

34:19.090 --> 34:20.489
A LITTLE BIT
BETTER.

34:20.590 --> 34:23.309
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
REALLY BAD CRAMPS.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.820
DO YOU NEED
ANOTHER PAD ?

34:25.930 --> 34:26.919
NO.

34:27.030 --> 34:27.724
ANOTHER MOTRIN ?

34:27.830 --> 34:30.458
NO, THAN KS.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.369
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY NEW HOUSE ?

34:32.470 --> 34:34.529
IT'S KINDA GROSS,
ISN'T IT ?

34:34.640 --> 34:35.959
NO, IT'S COOL.

34:36.070 --> 34:38.903
AND IT'S KINDA GROSS.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.534
I KNOW, SEE, I KNOW.

34:40.640 --> 34:43.074
I USED TO WONDER WHEN
I'D GET THERE, YOU KNOW ?

34:43.180 --> 34:44.977
TO THE GROWN-UP
PLACE ?

34:45.080 --> 34:48.072
I ALMOST GOT THERE
WITH NATE...

34:48.180 --> 34:53.311
AND THEN HERE I AM.

34:53.420 --> 34:56.719
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH
MY BROTHER, AREN'T YOU ?

34:56.820 --> 34:57.787
NO.

34:57.890 --> 35:00.029
NO.

35:00.130 --> 35:02.553
WELL, ONLY IN THE WAY
THAT I ALWAYS WILL BE.

35:02.660 --> 35:05.220
BUT NOT IN THE WAY
OF THINKING ABOUT HIM, LIKE

35:05.330 --> 35:07.821
"OH GOD, WHEN AM
I GONNA SEE NATE AGAIN,"

35:07.930 --> 35:09.261
OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

35:09.370 --> 35:10.735
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN ?

35:10.840 --> 35:13.035
YEAH, I DO.

35:13.140 --> 35:14.630
I AM WORRIED
ABOUT HIM THOUGH.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.901
I KNOW.

35:17.010 --> 35:20.173
IT'S SO FUCKED UP,
LISA BEING...

35:20.280 --> 35:24.683
WHATEVER SHE IS.

35:28.220 --> 35:30.586
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS
WEIRD ABOUT LISA ?

35:30.690 --> 35:32.920
WHAT ?

35:33.030 --> 35:35.123
WELL, I THINK
SHE REALLY LIKED ME.

35:35.230 --> 35:36.720
I'M SURE SHE DID.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.627
SHE WAS FUCKED UP, TOO,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.425
BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT
KIND OF FUCKED-UP

35:40.530 --> 35:42.168
FROM OUR FAMILY,
YOU KNOW ?

35:42.270 --> 35:44.909
IT WAS, LIKE, A MOSTLY
FRIENDLY KIND OF FUCKED-UP.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.831
YOU MISS HER ?

35:47.940 --> 35:50.272
I GUESS, YEAH.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.701
SORRY IF THAT'S...

35:52.810 --> 35:56.871
NO, IT'S TOTALLY RIGHT,
IT'S TOTALLY RIGHT.

36:06.530 --> 36:11.024
I WAS JUST GOING
TO DO IT WITH OLIVE OIL.

36:11.130 --> 36:12.859
NOTHING
TOO AGGRESSIVE.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.837
YOU WANT SOME ?

36:17.400 --> 36:21.200
NO, I DON'T THINK
I COULD EVER EAT AGAIN.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.942
* BEAUTIFUL BLUE SKIES

36:28.050 --> 36:32.419
* AND ALSO...

36:37.520 --> 36:40.489
* BLUE, THE PRETTY
COLOR OF THE OCEAN *

36:56.740 --> 36:58.549
HEY.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.345
'S NATE.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.878
TELL ME WHEN YOU WANT ME
TO STOP AND I'LL STOP.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.220
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO STOP.

37:32.210 --> 37:35.270
I WANT YOU
INSIDE ME.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.281
NO, NO, WAIT.

37:44.390 --> 37:46.028
I LIKE IT
LIKE THIS.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.552
YEAH.
YEAH ?

37:47.660 --> 37:50.322
OKAY.

37:52.300 --> 37:56.896
( moaning )

37:59.310 --> 38:01.676
OH!

38:01.780 --> 38:03.429
OH, YEAH !

38:03.540 --> 38:05.770
YOU'RE FUCKING ME...

38:05.880 --> 38:07.472
OH, FUCK ME !

38:07.580 --> 38:08.808
SHH, JUST DON'T
WAKE THE BABY.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.218
I DON'T CARE,
YOU'RE FUCKIN' ME SO GOOD.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.413
JUST FUCK ME !

38:13.520 --> 38:16.717
FUCK ME 'TIL I CAN'T
REMEMBER MY NAME !

38:16.820 --> 38:18.048
JUST FUCK ME !

38:18.160 --> 38:20.128
FUCK ME.

38:20.230 --> 38:24.826
FUCK ME, FUCK ME,
FUCK ME, FUCK ME !

38:24.930 --> 38:28.468
FUCK ME, FUCK ME... !

38:43.780 --> 38:46.146
"WHO WILL SEPARATE US
FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST ?

38:46.250 --> 38:49.014
"WILL HARDSHIP,
OR DISTRESS,

38:49.120 --> 38:51.088
"OR PERSECUTION,

38:51.190 --> 38:54.557
"OR FAMINE, OR PERIL
OF THE SWORD ?

38:54.660 --> 38:58.619
"NO, IN ALL THESE THINGS
WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS

38:58.730 --> 39:01.324
"THROUGH HIM
WHO LOVES US.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.637
"FOR I AM CONVINCED THAT
NEITHER DEATH, NOR LIFE...

39:04.740 --> 39:08.938
"NOR ANYTHING ELSE IN ALL
CREATION CAN SEPARE US

39:09.040 --> 39:10.928
FROM THE
LOVE OF GOD."

39:11.040 --> 39:15.977
CARL WILLIMAN WAS A PART
OF GOD'S GOOD CREATION--

39:16.080 --> 39:19.015
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO SIN, YES...

39:19.120 --> 39:21.452
BUT WORTHY
OF GRACE.

39:21.560 --> 39:25.485
MAY HIS SOUL, AND THE SOULS
OF THOSE WHOSE LIVES HE TOOK,

39:25.590 --> 39:29.629
FIND PEACE IN THE
INFINITELY COMPLICATED

39:29.730 --> 39:32.767
AND ETERNAL
LIFE OF GOD.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.831
I KNEW HER
AT SAINT BART'S.

39:39.940 --> 39:41.828
YEAH ?

39:41.940 --> 39:43.202
YEAH.

39:43.310 --> 39:45.073
SHE WAS PRETTY
FUCKED UP.

39:45.180 --> 39:48.570
SEEMS LIKE IT.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.879
SO, I CAME OUT
OF THE CLOSET.

39:54.990 --> 39:56.116
AND THAT WAS GOOD.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.551
YEAH.

39:57.660 --> 40:00.220
AND, I'M IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP.

40:00.330 --> 40:02.025
WITH KEITH ?

40:02.130 --> 40:03.688
YEAH.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.223
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A GOOD THING, TOO, RIGHT ?

40:06.330 --> 40:08.639
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE HEARD.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.038
SO, I DON'T KNOW,
SHLDN'T MY LIFE BE...

40:11.140 --> 40:12.698
BETTER ?

40:12.810 --> 40:15.973
TRUTH AND RELATIONSHIPS
DON'T MAKE LIFE BETTER, DAVID.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.308
THEY MAKE
LIFE POSSIBLE.

40:17.410 --> 40:21.301
SO, YOU THINK
I SHOULD STAY WITH KEITH.

40:21.410 --> 40:25.119
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO
WHATEVER BRINGS YOU DEEPER

40:25.220 --> 40:28.383
INTO THE REALITY
OF YOUR LIFE.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.685
THE REALITY
OF MY LIFE.

40:30.790 --> 40:33.520
YES, BUT NOT THE LIFE
YOU THINK YOU CAN HAVE.

40:33.630 --> 40:36.497
THE LIFE
YOU'VE GOT.

40:46.740 --> 40:47.604
HEY.

40:47.710 --> 40:49.109
HI.

40:49.210 --> 40:50.438
WHATCHA DOIN' ?

40:50.540 --> 40:54.146
I AM JUST CHECKING
THINGS OUT, YOU KNOW.

40:54.250 --> 40:55.945
KEEPING TRACK.

40:58.450 --> 41:00.839
I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME
LAST NIGHT.

41:00.950 --> 41:04.454
I THINK WE SHOULD...

41:04.560 --> 41:07.324
I THINK WE SHOULD
DO THAT AGAIN.

41:07.430 --> 41:09.125
I'M DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

41:09.230 --> 41:11.289
HOW COME ?

41:11.400 --> 41:12.662
I JUST DON'T.

41:12.770 --> 41:15.989
SORRY.

41:29.020 --> 41:32.410
( sniffling )

41:32.520 --> 41:35.159
ARE YOU SERIOUS,
YOU'RE GONNA CRY ?

41:35.260 --> 41:39.185
I CAN'T HELP IT.

41:39.290 --> 41:40.689
COME ON.

41:40.790 --> 41:44.351
HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT KIND OF
FUCKING WORLD THIS IS, HUH ?

41:44.460 --> 41:46.325
YOU SEE WHAT PEOPLE
DO TO EACH OTHER,

41:46.430 --> 41:48.489
WHAT YOUR FUCKIN' FATHER
DID TO PEOPLE,

41:48.600 --> 41:49.828
AND NOW
YOU'RE GONNA CRY ?

41:49.940 --> 41:52.329
"OH, FUCK ME,
FUCK ME, FUCK ME ?"

41:52.440 --> 41:53.361
"FUCK ME ?"

41:53.470 --> 41:56.473
YOU DON'T
GET TO CRY !

41:56.580 --> 42:01.005
( sobbing )

42:12.160 --> 42:14.048
HEY.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.321
HEY.

42:16.430 --> 42:17.590
WHERE WERE
YOU LAST NIGHT ?

42:17.700 --> 42:19.065
I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.125
TO WATCH MAYA ?

42:20.230 --> 42:21.492
YEAH.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.263
I WAS BUSY,
SORRY.

42:25.370 --> 42:26.632
CAN I HAVE THESE ?

42:26.740 --> 42:29.834
SURE, I DON'T CARE.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.949
IT'S WEIRD.

42:37.050 --> 42:38.142
WHAT ?

42:38.250 --> 42:40.115
WELL, RUSSELL USED TO SAY
THE WHOLE HOUSE SMELLED

42:40.220 --> 42:41.380
LIKE THE COLOR WHEEL.

42:41.490 --> 42:43.117
YEAH ?

42:43.220 --> 42:45.381
HE LIKED IT HERE.

42:45.490 --> 42:48.220
SOMEBODY SHOULD GET
SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

42:55.670 --> 42:58.059
NATE, MAYBE YOU COULD
GIVE BRENDA A BREAK.

42:58.170 --> 43:00.502
I KNOW SHE'S ONLY
TRYING TO HELP.

43:00.610 --> 43:02.771
THINGS BETWEEN
ME AND BRENDA...

43:02.880 --> 43:05.747
IT'S A WHOLE LOT
MORE COMPLICATED

43:05.850 --> 43:07.044
THAN YOU MIGHT
THINK, OKAY ?

43:07.150 --> 43:10.972
YEAH, I'M SURE
I COULD NEVER IMAGINE.

43:22.230 --> 43:24.198
SO, WHAT WENT WRONG ?

43:24.300 --> 43:28.122
WELL, THE FIRST ONE,
THAT WAS SUSIE, AND, UH,

43:28.230 --> 43:32.405
WE JUST GOT MARRIED
TOO YOUNG, THAT'S ALL.

43:32.510 --> 43:34.102
IT WASN'T
ANYBODY'S FAULT.

43:34.210 --> 43:35.438
NUMBER TWO.

43:35.540 --> 43:40.568
GLORIA, YEAH,
THAT ONE WAS MY FAULT.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.568
I SCREWED AROUND.

43:42.680 --> 43:44.147
GEORGE !

43:44.250 --> 43:45.387
I KNOW BETTER NOW.

43:45.490 --> 43:46.718
YOU BETTER
KNOW BETTER.

43:46.820 --> 43:48.219
NUMBER THREE.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.857
SHE WAS THE ONE I WAS
SCREWING AROUND WITH.

43:50.960 --> 43:54.521
TANYA.

43:54.630 --> 43:57.258
WE WERE AT RUTGERS,
MY FIRST JOB,

43:57.360 --> 43:59.362
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR,

43:59.470 --> 44:02.633
AND SHE CHEATED
ON ME ALL THE TIME.

44:02.740 --> 44:06.699
HOW DO YOU NOT
SEE THAT COMING ?

44:10.340 --> 44:14.071
ANDREA DIED.

44:14.180 --> 44:16.978
I'M SORRY.

44:17.080 --> 44:22.017
UH, CHERYL, THAT ONE
WAS ONLY FOR NINE MONTHS.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.657
AND DORIS,

44:24.760 --> 44:27.388
THE LAST ONE, DIED.

44:27.490 --> 44:29.958
I'M SO SORRY.

44:30.060 --> 44:33.325
WELL, YOU MARRY SIX PEOPLE,
A FEW OF THEM ARE GONNA DIE.

44:33.430 --> 44:34.897
IT'S THE ODDS.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.959
AND YOU'RE REALLY
READY TO TRY AGAIN ?

44:39.070 --> 44:40.401
WITH YOU ?

44:40.510 --> 44:42.000
OF COURSE.

44:42.110 --> 44:43.839
WHY ?

44:43.940 --> 44:45.578
YOU DON'T WANT TO ?

44:45.680 --> 44:50.117
NO, OF COURSE I DO,
GEORGE, I THINK...

44:50.220 --> 44:51.448
BUT...

44:51.550 --> 44:54.348
YOU'VE HAD
ALL THESE WOMEN.

44:54.450 --> 44:58.409
RUTH, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

44:58.520 --> 45:01.751
ONE TIME...

45:02.930 --> 45:04.989
ONE TIME
I BOUGHT A HOUSE.

45:05.100 --> 45:07.660
THIS WAS BACK
IN MASSACHUSETTS,

45:07.770 --> 45:09.635
WHEN I WAS TEACHING
AT AMHERST.

45:09.740 --> 45:14.404
AND THE HOUSE WAS
BUILT OVER A STREAM.

45:14.510 --> 45:16.831
LITERALLY OVER IT.

45:16.940 --> 45:19.602
IT HAD BEEN A MILL
AT ONE TIME,

45:19.710 --> 45:22.019
AND THEN SOMEONE HAD TAKEN THE
WHEELS AND GRINDING STONES OUT.

45:22.120 --> 45:25.146
BUT IT WAS STILL
OVER THE STREAM.

45:25.250 --> 45:29.710
AND AFTER WE MOVED IN
I WANTED TO PUT A NEW FLOOR

45:29.820 --> 45:31.117
IN THE KITCHEN.

45:31.220 --> 45:32.858
SO?

45:32.960 --> 45:35.952
SO, I TORE UP
THE OLD FLOOR.

45:36.060 --> 45:37.823
RIPPED UP
THE LINOLEUM.

45:37.930 --> 45:39.363
PULLED UP
THE PLYWOOD.

45:39.470 --> 45:43.065
AND THEN I PULLED UP
ONE OF THE ORIGINAL BOARDS.

45:43.170 --> 45:48.164
THIS ZOO-YEAR-OLD
PINE BOARD.

45:48.270 --> 45:54.505
AND THERE WAS THIS STREAM,
NOT TWO FEET UNDERNEATH ME.

45:54.610 --> 45:57.147
I'D ALWAYS
KNOWN IT WAS THERE.

45:57.250 --> 45:59.218
BUT THERE IT WAS.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.582
YOU KNOW ?

46:00.690 --> 46:02.317
REALLY.

46:02.420 --> 46:05.127
THERE IT REALLY WAS.

46:05.230 --> 46:08.188
THIS LIVE...

46:08.290 --> 46:10.997
SPARKLY WATER.

46:11.100 --> 46:16.333
FLOWING RIGHT
UNDERNEATH MY HOUSE.

46:20.670 --> 46:24.003
THAT'S HOW
I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

46:28.380 --> 46:29.938
WHAT ?

46:30.050 --> 46:32.189
DID I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG ?

46:32.290 --> 46:33.587
I'M SORRY.

46:33.690 --> 46:36.386
YOU MAKE ME MISS
NATHANIEL A LITTLE.

46:36.490 --> 46:38.412
I'M SORRY.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.454
IT'S OKAY.

46:40.560 --> 46:44.826
I MISS A FEW
OF MINE TOO.

46:49.300 --> 46:51.689
AND HE WAS, LIKE,
"I'M PAYING YOUR RENT,

46:51.800 --> 46:53.165
"AND I BUY YOU
ALL THIS SHIT,

46:53.270 --> 46:55.534
"AND I EXPECT YOU TO BE
AVAILABLE TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME

46:55.640 --> 46:56.777
WHENEVER I WANT."

46:56.880 --> 46:59.940
AND I WAS LIKE, "NO."

47:02.620 --> 47:04.679
I'M GLAD WE COULD
BE HERE FOR YOU.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.941
YEAH, ME TOO.

47:07.050 --> 47:10.349
BUT YOU GOTTA TREAT
MY SISTER BETTER, RICO,

47:10.460 --> 47:12.781
OR SHE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU LIKE I
LEFT THAT MOTHERFUCKIN' ANTHONY.

47:12.890 --> 47:14.448
SHE WILL.

47:14.560 --> 47:17.996
YOU GUYS ARE
OUT OF POPCORN.

47:27.670 --> 47:29.570
OH, GOD.

48:28.530 --> 48:29.167
(turning tv on )

48:29.270 --> 48:30.430
The family overruled it !

48:30.540 --> 48:32.758
Said they'd be
too high in carbohydrates.

48:32.870 --> 48:34.531
( shutting tv off)

48:36.910 --> 48:38.434
WE HAVE TO TALK.

48:38.540 --> 48:42.044
WHAT IS IT, I HAD
A FUCKIN' DAY FROM HELL.

48:42.150 --> 48:46.940
I DON'T WANT US
TO BE TOGETHER ANYMORE.

48:49.820 --> 48:51.310
YOU'RE BREAKING UP
WITH ME ?

48:51.420 --> 48:53.081
YEAH, I'M BREAKING UP
WITH YOU.

48:53.190 --> 48:54.828
BUT, WAIT A MINUTE...

48:54.930 --> 48:55.726
NO!

48:55.830 --> 48:56.922
DAVID--

48:57.030 --> 48:57.928
JUST GIVE ME A FEW DAYS
TO FIND A PLACE

48:58.030 --> 48:59.019
AND I'LL BE
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

48:59.130 --> 49:00.062
AND YOU CAN FIND
SOMEBODY MORE...

49:00.170 --> 49:02.035
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU LIKE, MEAN.

49:02.140 --> 49:03.869
WE SHOULD GO TO THERAPY
AND TALK ABOUT THIS !

49:03.970 --> 49:06.029
IT'S NOT
A DISCUSSION, KEITH !

49:06.140 --> 49:07.698
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT !

49:07.810 --> 49:08.970
IT'S NEVER BEEN
RIGHT BETWEEN US,

49:09.080 --> 49:10.900
IT NEVER WILL BE,
THAT'S FINE !

49:11.010 --> 49:12.841
WE CAN STOP WASTING
EACH OTHER'S TIME.

49:12.950 --> 49:13.905
PLEASE,
DON'T DO THIS--

49:14.010 --> 49:15.443
OR WHAT,
YOU'LL HIT ME ?

49:15.550 --> 49:17.017
NO.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.872
I AM SO SICK OF BEING
SCARED OF YOU, KEITH !

49:18.990 --> 49:19.945
I HATE IT !

49:20.050 --> 49:23.417
I ABSOLUTELY
FUCKING HATE IT !

49:41.240 --> 49:44.437
( running water)

49:58.720 --> 50:01.223
LIS ?

50:14.070 --> 50:16.675
LISA !

50:18.180 --> 50:21.149
LISA, WHERE ARE YOU ?!

50:21.250 --> 50:23.718
I'M RIGHT HERE.

50:26.520 --> 50:30.251
( baby crying )

50:30.360 --> 50:33.056
(Uw)
WHERE ARE YOU ?

50:36.430 --> 50:37.727
I DON'T KNOW.

50:37.830 --> 50:40.924
NONE OF THIS TURNED OUT
THE WAY I WANTED IT TO, LIS.

50:41.030 --> 50:42.998
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT ?

50:43.100 --> 50:45.432
I WANTED
TO LOVE YOU.

50:45.540 --> 50:46.507
I DID LOVE YOU.

50:46.610 --> 50:50.205
AND I JUST FELT LIKE
WE WERE BEGINNING TO...

50:51.910 --> 50:53.844
I KNOW WE WERE,
I KNOW IT.

50:53.950 --> 50:55.315
I KNOW IT IN MY HEART.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.445
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAD THIS
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME CHANCE

50:57.550 --> 50:59.279
AND I FUCKED IT UP.

51:00.090 --> 51:01.182
NATE.

51:01.290 --> 51:04.111
I'M NOT A CHANCE,
I'M A PERSON.

51:07.060 --> 51:11.292
( sobbing )
