00:44.696 --> 00:48.787
-When Abaddon the angel fell,

00:48.918 --> 00:52.226
he made his home in
the depths of Hell,

00:53.488 --> 00:56.926
alone and full of dark despair.

00:57.057 --> 01:01.278
He defied the god
who'd sent him there.

01:01.409 --> 01:04.325
Escaping from his fiery den,

01:04.455 --> 01:08.894
he clawed his way
to the land of men.

01:09.025 --> 01:13.073
In the guise of a pauper,
he lived his days,

01:13.203 --> 01:16.989
unseen by God's selective gaze.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.690
Lost and alone, a
one-winged dove,

01:22.995 --> 01:26.260
he met a woman and
found true love.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.177
Playing tricks for
her, the Devil's art,

01:30.307 --> 01:33.615
and soon enough,
he'd won her heart.

01:35.095 --> 01:39.708
But bodies fade and rot inside

01:39.838 --> 01:43.277
and by and by, his lover died.

01:44.365 --> 01:47.803
Enraged, the Devil
ripped his guise

01:47.933 --> 01:51.241
and yelled up to the holy skies.

01:52.416 --> 01:56.116
God awoke in a perilous fit

01:56.246 --> 02:00.729
and dragged the Devil
back to his pit.

02:02.339 --> 02:06.169
But he clung to his love,
his claws pulled her asunder

02:06.300 --> 02:11.131
'til God pushed him down and
the dark sucked him under.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.005
Vultures picked at the body.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.616
God watched the theft

02:19.704 --> 02:24.535
'til only the bones and
her heart were left.

02:26.233 --> 02:30.062
And while God slept,
the heart revived

02:31.107 --> 02:36.025
with the Devil's
needle lodged inside.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.463
Know this, the Devil
has his friends,

02:39.594 --> 02:43.859
the murderers, thieves,
the odds and ends,

02:43.989 --> 02:47.950
the quiet and broken,
the brutally flawed

02:48.080 --> 02:52.172
who slip beneath
the eyes of God.

02:53.260 --> 02:57.046
And so the heart
was lost 'til found

02:57.177 --> 02:59.918
and through the
ages passed around

03:00.049 --> 03:03.966
by those who like to cut and sew

03:04.096 --> 03:07.622
while the Devil guides
them from below,

03:07.752 --> 03:11.103
to hide the heart
in flesh and bone

03:11.234 --> 03:14.498
so the Devil will
no more be alone.

03:15.847 --> 03:19.938
And they sing this
song soft and sweet

03:20.069 --> 03:24.204
to keep the heavens
sound asleep.

03:26.510 --> 03:30.688
When the road is mean,
blood will thicken.

03:32.124 --> 03:36.216

begins to quicken.

While the body rots
to dust and bones,

03:43.440 --> 03:47.183
there's a tear in the heart
where the Devil roams.

Time to fix the tips.

17:19.951 --> 17:20.996
Wanna watch?

17:23.085 --> 17:25.000

can keep a secret.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.396
[quiet, menacing music]

17:37.056 --> 17:40.537
When I was a boy,
I loved the circus.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.063
Every summer, when
it came to town,

17:44.193 --> 17:46.152
my mother would
give me five pennies

17:47.283 --> 17:49.155
to see the show
under the big top.

17:50.939 --> 17:54.334
The Strong Man, ladies
riding the elephants,

17:56.162 --> 17:59.600
and the acrobats,
flying through the air.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.519
I saw a man drop to his death.

18:07.912 --> 18:12.221
His brains flew out
of his head like

18:12.352 --> 18:15.268
cotton candy, all pink and
soft, all over the crowd.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.098
And a lion eat the
arm off a little girl.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.666
[chuckles] I saw Rizzo the
Wizzo take her final ride

18:22.797 --> 18:28.019
through her meat cannon, her
insides now on the outside.

18:29.195 --> 18:32.111
[chuckles] But I longed
for something different,

18:33.286 --> 18:35.505
a ticket away from
my mother's tears,

18:37.159 --> 18:38.682
my father's fists.

18:41.598 --> 18:42.425
Magic.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.781
And I found it
[quiet, menacing music]

18:50.912 --> 18:52.305
in this small tent,

18:53.958 --> 18:55.612
on a battered little stage,

18:58.659 --> 18:59.921
not unlike yours.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.447
A man by the name of Broken Cane

19:07.015 --> 19:11.193
who performed acts,
small and sickening,

19:12.586 --> 19:16.024
a pinky, a big toe, snip, snip,

19:16.155 --> 19:19.549
and the very next
show, they'd be back.

19:19.680 --> 19:20.985
He's no rabbit puller,

19:22.378 --> 19:23.597
no card counter.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.648
How'd he do that?
[distant dog barks]

19:31.779 --> 19:33.563
I just had to know.

19:35.043 --> 19:40.048
So I watched and I
listened, and one night,

19:41.136 --> 19:43.007
he told me the
story of Abaddon--

19:44.574 --> 19:46.620
[distant dog barking]

19:46.750 --> 19:48.012
And the magic heart.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.582
It was a burden he
was happy to unload.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.979
And when he stank
of wine and piss,

20:00.460 --> 20:05.160
I took his magic
and made my own pact

20:07.336 --> 20:09.991
with the darkness.
[quiet, menacing music]

20:10.121 --> 20:13.255
But I'm not greedy,
I stick to the tips.

20:14.343 --> 20:17.607
Only the tips.
[flesh squelches]

20:17.738 --> 20:20.523
When you dance with the Devil,
you gotta make it quick.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.920
So I sing a lullaby,
soft and sweet,

20:27.008 --> 20:30.490
to keep the heavens
sound asleep.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.410
[distant dog barking]

20:37.540 --> 20:41.240
When the road is mean,
blood will thicken.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.461
The Devil's pulse
begins to quicken

20:46.941 --> 20:50.510
while the body rots
to dust and bones.

20:52.033 --> 20:57.081
There's a tear in the heart
where the Devil roams.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.215
[quiet, dark music]

21:03.087 --> 21:05.002
That's a powerful psalm, honey.

21:06.439 --> 21:10.312
[distant dog barking]
[quiet, dark music]

21:10.443 --> 21:14.011
Don't get any ideas, missy,
Devil and me got a deal.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.276
Needs to be heard anyway,

21:18.364 --> 21:21.497
sweet as the breeze
in Abaddon's ear.

21:21.628 --> 21:24.587

27:53.802 --> 27:55.021

-Then why are you
reading about 'em?

27:57.110 --> 27:59.286
-Comedy, I guess.

28:02.985 --> 28:06.554
So this early group, they
were called gnostics.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.645
They believed the Devil
was telling the truth

28:12.212 --> 28:13.604

28:14.823 --> 28:16.172

brought the apple,

28:21.787 --> 28:22.875

28:27.140 --> 28:28.576
he brought her knowledge,
