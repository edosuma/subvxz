WEBVTT

00:18.811 --> 00:19.729
[Billy] Previously on
Billy the Kid...

00:19.812 --> 00:20.646
[Antonio] Why are you interested

00:20.730 --> 00:21.981
in my daughter, Mr. Bonney?

00:22.064 --> 00:24.233
I love her.
I wanna marry her.

00:24.316 --> 00:27.695
My ancestors would never
approve of this.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.488
I think your daughter
deserves that choice.

00:29.572 --> 00:32.158
[Walz] Mr. Catron
is deeply concerned

00:32.241 --> 00:34.869
about the current financial
position of the House.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.537
We know that the House
is losing money

00:36.620 --> 00:38.080
and we know
the Englishman Tunstall's

00:38.164 --> 00:39.665
coming to some of our markets.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.417
[Jesse] I know Tunstall
keeps some of his stock

00:41.500 --> 00:43.836
down at Dick Brewer's ranch.
His cattle and his horses.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.713
I say we raid 'em.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.591
[Brewer] Hey! Get off
my property, you damn thieves.

00:48.674 --> 00:52.094
[gunshots]

00:52.178 --> 00:53.179
[Brewer] I recognized
Jesse Evans.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.513
-Hiya!
-[Brewer] And I suspect

00:54.597 --> 00:56.557
the rest were a part of his
7 Rivers Gang.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.184
And as Deputy Sheriff,
I have the authority

00:58.267 --> 00:59.935
to insist that
you organize a posse

01:00.019 --> 01:01.771
and go and recover
the stolen goods.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.190
-[neighing]
-[Jesse] Let's go, come on!

01:04.272 --> 01:05.775
[gunshots]

01:05.858 --> 01:07.443
[shouting indistinctly]

01:07.526 --> 01:08.694
[neighing]

01:08.778 --> 01:09.904
[Billy] Come out, Jesse.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.530
-[gunshot]
-[groaning]

01:11.614 --> 01:13.574
-[Billy] Keep your hands up.
-Don't shoot.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.452
Smallpox ward.

01:18.454 --> 01:19.955
Mr. Tunstall.

01:20.039 --> 01:22.249
We'll give you a fair price
for your stock,

01:22.333 --> 01:24.543
your herds and your real estate.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.212
And in return?

01:26.295 --> 01:28.798
[Walz] You get rid
of your employees,

01:28.881 --> 01:30.216
and you leave Lincoln County.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.051
[Tunstall] And what if
I refuse your offer?

01:32.134 --> 01:33.551
[Walz] You'll be killed.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.763
[Tunstall] I have a plan.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.098
It involves helping Jesse
and his gang escape from jail.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.060
What? Why would we do that?

01:41.143 --> 01:44.271
I have given you a second
chance in life, Billy.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.066
In return,
I expect your loyalty.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.401
Mr. Evans. John Tunstall.

01:49.485 --> 01:52.279
Think of it as a, uh,
a peace offering.

01:52.363 --> 01:53.823
-[gun cocking]
-[Billy] Don't move.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.991
[clanking]

01:56.075 --> 01:57.993
Nice work, Billy boy.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.662
-Thank you.
-[groans]

01:59.745 --> 02:02.414
By forcing you to go along
with my stupid plan,

02:02.498 --> 02:04.124
I nearly got you killed.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.419
[Jesse] Hey. Hands on
the table please, new friends.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.420
You were prepared
to stand up for me

02:09.505 --> 02:10.798
even though you knew the danger.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.424
What the hell are you
doin', Jesse?

02:12.508 --> 02:14.593
[Jesse] Tunstall's a fool. There
ain't no chance at peace here.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.136
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

02:16.220 --> 02:18.639
If you want me to be
a partner in this,

02:18.722 --> 02:21.141
if you want to be victorious,
you need to trust me.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.935
We have a war to win.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.687
It starts tomorrow.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.481
[Tunstall] Thank you.

02:43.454 --> 02:46.292
Sam, go fetch Mr. McSween.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.002
Yes, sir, Mr. Brewer.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.220
Sheriff, how can I help you?

02:59.388 --> 03:02.057
-I have something for you.
-What's this?

03:02.141 --> 03:03.893
It's a legal writ
against this store.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.853
You're gonna have to close up.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.355
This store is no longer trading.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.482
You're all gonna
have to go home.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.192
Please go home.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.904
[indistinct murmurs]

03:14.987 --> 03:16.238
You can't do this.

03:16.322 --> 03:17.323
This store has been
trading illegally.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.991
That's for the courts to decide.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.826
And you known damn well
we'll fight you.

03:20.910 --> 03:22.494
[Brady] Mr. Brewer,
you have no chance.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.829
And you can expect warrants

03:23.913 --> 03:25.873
from Mr. Tunstall
and Mr. McSween.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.249
I'm a Deputy.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.709
You can't just go over my head.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.003
Mr. Brewer, your appointment
as Deputy Sheriff

03:31.086 --> 03:33.339
has been rescinded, by order
of District Attorney,

03:33.422 --> 03:35.341
Thomas Catron in Santa Fe.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.886
And I'm obliged to ask you
to surrender your badge.

03:57.613 --> 03:58.906
[man] Whoa.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.079
What in hell's name
is happening here?

04:05.162 --> 04:06.622
What are you trying
to do, Sheriff?

04:06.705 --> 04:08.540
I'm only serving a legal
writ, Mr. McSween.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.168
I'm only trying to do
my duty and nothing more.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.673
How much did they pay you?

04:20.844 --> 04:22.554
I got to tell you,
Mr. McSween,

04:22.638 --> 04:25.224
that you too are being
investigated for serious crimes.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.893
So I suggest that you mind
your manners,

04:27.977 --> 04:29.812
keep your mouth shut.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.037
[man] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:55.713 --> 04:56.964
[clears throat]

04:57.047 --> 04:59.800
So, I've heard that
Sheriff Brady and a posse

04:59.883 --> 05:01.301
will arrive here
in the morning,

05:01.385 --> 05:04.596
to serve you with a writ
and seize all of your horses.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.348
They don't give a hang
about the legalities.

05:06.432 --> 05:07.725
I see.

05:11.353 --> 05:14.773
Dick, what do you think
we should do?

05:14.857 --> 05:16.400
That's up to you, boss.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.611
Billy?

05:19.695 --> 05:21.405
We should defend the ranch.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.741
Protect your property.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.201
We gotta fight 'em.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.497
Billy's right.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.835
We have to take a stand.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.423
One of you should ride into
Lincoln and tell Juan Patron.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.802
Tom, go get Charlie and George.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.221
We need every gun
we can get. Now.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.683
Mr. McSween,
would you like a gun?

05:50.476 --> 05:51.852
No.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.479
I was a pastor all these years

05:53.562 --> 05:55.481
and I've sworn off
ever using a gun myself.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.108
Then you best go home,
Alexander.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.862
-We'll manage.
-I know you will.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.156
God bless you.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.449
And you.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.253
[theme music]

07:19.064 --> 07:21.066
[grunting]

07:21.150 --> 07:22.985
[Middleton] Let's stack these
as barricades.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.963
[Middleton] Block the gate.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.816
[insects chirping]

08:26.048 --> 08:28.550
[indistinct chatter]

08:34.890 --> 08:36.015
[George] Outta here.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.101
Unbelievable.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.438
[indistinct chatter]

08:47.778 --> 08:49.905
[overlapping chatter]

08:53.408 --> 08:55.035
[George] Who's got
no chips left?

08:55.118 --> 08:57.246
[indistinct chatter]

09:03.794 --> 09:04.795
You okay?

09:06.296 --> 09:09.549
I was just...
thinking about things.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.304
If you really want to know,
I was, um...

09:15.305 --> 09:17.140
...thinking about my father.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.061
What about him?

09:21.853 --> 09:23.313
Well, he was a...

09:25.274 --> 09:27.943
Well, I suppose he was rather
typical for an Englishman

09:28.026 --> 09:29.569
of his class and background.

09:30.988 --> 09:35.492
Highly intelligent, highly
principled, very successful.

09:37.536 --> 09:41.540
He set this absurdly high bar
for me to achieve,

09:41.623 --> 09:43.375
and then whenever I failed,

09:43.458 --> 09:45.919
he found ways to scold
and punish me.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.756
I was always desperate
to impress him.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.134
That's why I came to live here.

09:54.052 --> 09:59.224
I wanted to create
something of my own

09:59.308 --> 10:02.811
that would make my father
at least proud of me.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.772
I think that's exactly
what you've done.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.442
Is it?

10:09.651 --> 10:12.612
Seems to me that I'm making
rather a mess of things.

10:12.696 --> 10:16.992
Mr. Tunstall, you're up against
some real mean motherfuckers.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.789
I'm proud of you
for standing up to 'em.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.709
Just look around.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.755
You got some of the best souls
in the territory behind you.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.090
Good, honest people.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.384
That alone tells me
you're succeeding.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.138
And if your father had
any sense or understanding,

10:38.221 --> 10:39.473
he'd see that himself.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.145
Thank you, Billy.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.531
[sighing]

10:58.116 --> 10:59.993
You are not going
to want to hear this.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.956
But I can't put the lives of
all these people on the line.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.500
I don't want to see

11:06.583 --> 11:10.337
all these honest and decent folk
getting killed in my name.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.507
I don't want a showdown.
Not yet, anyway.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.718
You said we had
to stand up to 'em.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.053
You said we didn't
have a choice.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.554
Well, maybe we do have a choice.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.056
I was just thinking
that we could move

11:21.139 --> 11:23.141
the horses before
the sheriff gets here.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.519
I bought another farm
up near the fort

11:25.602 --> 11:27.312
and we can take them there
and then figure out

11:27.396 --> 11:29.981
the next step and I don't think
the sheriff will follow us.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.359
No, we can't keep runnin' away.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.575
You think I'm being
a coward, don't you?

11:42.744 --> 11:48.708
I don't want you or any
of these people to die for me.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.921
I couldn't live with myself.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.802
Now if that makes me
a coward, so be it.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.017
-[shouting]
-[whistling]

12:06.101 --> 12:07.894
[neighing]

12:09.771 --> 12:11.106
-[clicks tongue]
-[Billy] Come on.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.360
[shouting indistinctly]

12:15.444 --> 12:17.404
[whistling]

12:22.367 --> 12:24.369
[Billy] All right, get 'em out.
[whistles]

12:24.453 --> 12:26.455
[Brewer] We gotta clear out
before the posse gets here.

12:28.623 --> 12:31.251
-[neighing]
-[shouting]

12:38.175 --> 12:41.303
Mr. Tunstall thinks the sheriff
won't try and follow us.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.762
But I ain't so sure.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.764
You two take it in turns
to drop back and check.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.480
[shouting]

13:12.334 --> 13:14.127
So, what about your father?

13:15.337 --> 13:16.880
What kind of a man was he?

13:18.173 --> 13:19.549
He was a proud Irishman.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.718
He never wanted to leave.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.012
There just wasn't much
left for him there.

13:25.514 --> 13:28.683
Turns out there wasn't much for
immigrants in New York either.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.562
-So, you were poor?
-Oh, dirt poor.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.106
That's why my parents decided
to come out west.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.525
To find a better life.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.863
Yeah...

13:42.531 --> 13:44.449
It must have been hard.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.742
Mm-hmm.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.540
Somewhere along the wagon
trail, my father got sick.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.501
He kinda gave up.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.925
Did you love him, Billy?
Your father?

14:08.557 --> 14:09.891
He was my father.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.938
But he quit on me.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.441
I swear to you, Billy,

14:19.943 --> 14:21.695
I won't let you down.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.703
[creaking]

14:29.786 --> 14:32.497
[ominous music]

14:32.581 --> 14:34.207
[growls]

14:35.292 --> 14:37.711
[neighing in the distance]

14:39.254 --> 14:41.464
[shouting]

14:53.184 --> 14:54.227
[grunting]

15:01.651 --> 15:03.069
[neighing]

15:16.124 --> 15:18.585
[door rattling]

15:21.504 --> 15:23.131
They're not here, Jesse.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.217
All right!
You think I can't see that?

15:26.301 --> 15:28.094
[neighing]

15:31.389 --> 15:33.058
[Jesse] Let's follow 'em, boys!

15:33.141 --> 15:35.226
I don't think we should do that.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.728
Why not?

15:36.811 --> 15:38.730
[Baker] We're just
Brady's posse.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.899
Legally,
all we're supposed to do

15:40.982 --> 15:42.984
is serve Tunstall a writ,
seize some horses.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.903
Not chase him halfway
across the country.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.780
We are the fuckin' law!

15:48.031 --> 15:51.159
-We do what we want, boys.
-[Beckwith] Jesse's right.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.786
That's what we've been told.
That's what we outta do.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.245
It's a bad idea.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.081
We gotta talk to the sheriff.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.458
What is wrong with all of ya?

15:59.167 --> 16:02.337
We all know what we are
really meant to do here.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.631
I tell you, my knife is sharp

16:04.714 --> 16:06.341
and I feel like
scalping someone!

16:06.424 --> 16:08.760
So, let's get after 'em, boys!
Come on!

16:08.843 --> 16:11.137
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!

16:12.681 --> 16:15.350
[exclaiming]

16:39.915 --> 16:41.918
[man] Jesse, these tracks
look fresh.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.046
[exclaiming]

16:45.130 --> 16:46.256
[clicks tongue]

16:52.387 --> 16:53.847
[neighing]

16:57.434 --> 16:59.144
Anyone following, George?

16:59.227 --> 17:01.312
No. All clear.
Didn't see a soul.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.355
All right.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.067
[exclaiming]

17:08.778 --> 17:11.573
[exclaiming]

17:11.656 --> 17:13.157
You boys hungry?

17:13.241 --> 17:14.826
[Middleton] Yes, and there's
our lunch. Come on.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.536
-[Waite] Let's go get 'em.
-[all agreeing]

17:16.618 --> 17:17.996
[Waite] Let's go!

17:18.079 --> 17:20.373
[indistinct chatter]

17:20.457 --> 17:23.501
Go on, Billy.
You're the best marksman.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.211
Go get us some lunch.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.090
Come on, Tom.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.717
[Tom] Mind the horses,
Mr. Tunstall.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.561
[ominous music]

17:42.771 --> 17:44.939
[shouting]

17:47.358 --> 17:49.486
[exclaiming]

17:55.116 --> 17:57.076
-[man] Let's go! Ya!
-[neighing]

17:59.454 --> 18:00.872
-Think we gonna eat today?
-[chuckling]

18:00.955 --> 18:02.916
Maybe if they can actually
hit anything.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.293
[gunshots]

18:05.376 --> 18:06.878
Ah, shit!

18:06.961 --> 18:09.589
[gunshots]

18:10.215 --> 18:13.510
[gunfire in the distance]

18:20.809 --> 18:21.935
[groans]

18:22.560 --> 18:23.978
It's Jesse and his boys.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.442
[shouting indistinctly]

18:34.489 --> 18:36.115
Where's he goin'?

18:38.493 --> 18:41.704
[Jesse] Hiya! Ya!

18:42.580 --> 18:45.416
Ah shit. That's Tunstall.
He's on his own.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.502
I'm gonna go get him.
Wait here.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.318
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

19:20.034 --> 19:22.662
[gasping]

19:53.276 --> 19:57.280
[dramatic music]

20:02.994 --> 20:06.039
-[sighing]
-I shouldn't have left him.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.293
I shouldn't have left him.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.011
No!

20:20.094 --> 20:21.888
-Fuck!
-[neighing]

20:24.599 --> 20:27.143
[insects chirping]

21:13.398 --> 21:15.191
[indistinct chatter]

21:16.818 --> 21:18.778
[Saturnino, in Spanish]

21:34.544 --> 21:35.878
[in English] Well?

21:36.671 --> 21:41.134
They struck out from Tunstall's
ranch around dawn, with horses.

21:42.051 --> 21:46.014
Picked up their trail,
and we caught up with them.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.265
And then?

21:47.348 --> 21:49.017
And there was a firefight.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.478
Now we had legal authority
to seize those animals,

21:52.562 --> 21:54.439
but they were bent on resisting.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.482
We were afraid for our lives.

21:57.108 --> 22:00.028
Finally, we tracked down
Tunstall himself.

22:00.111 --> 22:03.781
We told him to surrender,
but he just refused.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.534
He fired at us,
and we fired back.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.494
And you're saying he's dead?

22:11.080 --> 22:12.331
Yes, sir.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.376
Resisting arrest?

22:15.460 --> 22:17.587
Yes, Sheriff.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.176
In what fucking universe
do you find this amusing?

22:23.259 --> 22:25.636
What you've done
may have terrible consequences

22:25.720 --> 22:27.472
for all of us.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.390
So don't look so fucking happy.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.361
[door closing]

23:03.424 --> 23:06.385
[dramatic music]

23:11.933 --> 23:13.476
You gave me hope.

23:16.354 --> 23:17.772
A new life.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.417
I swear on my mother's grave...

23:40.336 --> 23:43.422
...I will kill every man
involved in your murder,

23:45.049 --> 23:48.594
or die myself in the attempt,
so help me God.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.726
[cheering]

23:55.810 --> 23:58.729
[gunshots]

23:58.813 --> 24:01.357
[lively music]

24:05.653 --> 24:08.447
We finally got the fucker!

24:08.531 --> 24:11.159
[cheering]

24:13.494 --> 24:17.039
Happy fucking Christmas,
everybody!

24:22.003 --> 24:24.172
Gentlemen! Ho-ho!

24:24.255 --> 24:26.924
Listen up, boys.
Listen up.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.426
[shushing]

24:28.509 --> 24:30.761
[silence]

24:30.845 --> 24:34.265
Today is a great day
for the House.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.934
[cheering]

24:37.018 --> 24:40.855
And that is why I want
to salute the founder

24:40.938 --> 24:44.108
Major Murphy, a war hero.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.277
To Major Murphy.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.612
[cheering]

24:47.695 --> 24:50.281
Major Murphy! Major Murphy!

24:50.364 --> 24:52.867
[cheering]

24:55.745 --> 24:57.496
[Olinger] Where's the music?

24:57.580 --> 25:00.666
[lively music]

25:10.718 --> 25:13.387
[ominous music]

25:26.984 --> 25:28.694
Whoa.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.199
Howdy.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.201
What's your business here today?

25:36.077 --> 25:39.247
I have a meeting
with Mr. Riley at the House,

25:39.330 --> 25:41.415
if it's any of your business.

25:43.251 --> 25:46.212
-What's your name?
-My name's Edgar Walz.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.173
I represent Thomas Catron.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.549
Oh.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.303
I heard of him.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.014
Who might you be?

25:57.098 --> 25:58.933
I'm Jesse Evans.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.060
Oh.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.105
I've heard of you.

26:04.188 --> 26:08.067
They, um, they tell me
you're a dangerous man.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.405
I like that.

26:13.114 --> 26:17.702
Yeah, well, depends on what you
mean by dangerous, Mr. Walz.

26:17.785 --> 26:21.122
What I mean is I might
have a use for you.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.374
In due course.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.001
Ah.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.296
I'm glad we met, Mr. Evans.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.214
Call me Jesse.

26:30.298 --> 26:33.384
That's very kind of you.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.511
Now Jesse...

26:36.971 --> 26:38.264
May I pass?

26:39.307 --> 26:40.766
Sure.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.115
Prick.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.871
[Walz] So...

27:03.164 --> 27:06.584
I came to inform you
that Mr. Catron is very pleased

27:06.667 --> 27:10.296
with the termination
of John Tunstall's interest

27:10.379 --> 27:13.007
in the economic affairs
of Lincoln County.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.467
Thank you.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.926
It's something
that no one wanted,

27:16.010 --> 27:19.180
but the fact remains that
Tunstall was a criminal.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.515
It's all been very sad.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.434
However, I must remind you

27:23.517 --> 27:26.771
that you are still in
substantial debt to Mr. Catron.

27:26.854 --> 27:31.400
And Mr. Catron remains unhappy
with the current situation.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.861
Well, I don't understand.

27:33.944 --> 27:36.781
With Tunstall outta the way,
things have completely changed.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.992
Do you take me
for a fool, Mr. Riley?

27:41.077 --> 27:43.329
There's a serious war
going on,

27:43.412 --> 27:45.122
and Mr. Catron
is very concerned

27:45.206 --> 27:47.792
that this, um,
Billy the Kid can,

27:47.875 --> 27:49.543
on his own account,
inflict serious damage

27:49.627 --> 27:51.504
on your business and employees.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.297
We can handle it.

27:53.381 --> 27:54.840
We've got the guns

27:54.924 --> 27:57.635
and the House
is a fuckin' institution.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.220
And I think it's about time

27:59.303 --> 28:02.223
that you start respecting that,
Mr. Walz.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.851
Wanna know how I see it, Riley?

28:09.313 --> 28:12.858
The House is facing imminent
financial disaster.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.529
So, in view of this
perilous situation,

28:16.612 --> 28:18.823
Mr. Catron is suggesting
that you mortgage to him

28:18.906 --> 28:21.867
all your holdings
in Lincoln County.

28:21.951 --> 28:26.330
In return, Mr. Catron will
lend you 25,000 dollars,

28:26.414 --> 28:29.542
repayable in three months' time.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.671
If you default on the loan,
however,

28:33.754 --> 28:36.215
Mr. Catron will own
all mortgaged property.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.928
I thought that we were
in business together.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.556
Mr. Riley, don't you know that
in all business transactions

28:43.639 --> 28:45.558
there is one leading partner.

28:47.476 --> 28:50.020
How the fuck am I supposed
to find this money?

28:50.104 --> 28:51.647
That's your business.

28:52.606 --> 28:55.025
But I suggest you bring
an end to this war

28:55.109 --> 28:56.527
as promptly as possible.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.279
Come, come, Mr. Riley.

28:58.362 --> 29:00.197
I've told you before,
this is business.

29:00.281 --> 29:02.158
There's no sentiment
in business.

29:03.701 --> 29:08.080
Now, if you accept the terms
of this mortgage agreement,

29:08.164 --> 29:11.083
please sign this legal
and binding document.

29:12.543 --> 29:13.961
[chuckling]

29:20.384 --> 29:21.927
Wonderful.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.024
Been a pleasure.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.785
I'll see myself out.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.007
What'd you expect?

30:00.090 --> 30:01.342
Hmm?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.970
I told you a long time ago,

30:05.054 --> 30:07.806
you are too naive be dealing
with a man like Catron.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.976
He's smarter than
you'll ever be.

30:13.270 --> 30:17.483
I don't need any fuckin' advice
from a stupid old drunk!

30:21.529 --> 30:23.322
You won't shoot me.

30:25.908 --> 30:30.079
The minute you shoot me,
Riley, you lose everything!

30:31.038 --> 30:32.414
Think about that.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.834
I'm the only person that
can talk to Catron.

30:35.918 --> 30:38.379
And I'm the only person
he'll listen to.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.340
Eh?

30:43.551 --> 30:45.094
[gun cocking]

30:53.978 --> 30:55.354
Go on, shoot me.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.191
Fuckin' shoot me!

31:04.572 --> 31:07.199
O that thou wouldest
hide me in the grave,

31:08.117 --> 31:10.411
that thou wouldest
keep me secret,

31:10.494 --> 31:12.246
until thy wrath be past,

31:12.329 --> 31:16.333
that thou wouldest appoint me
a set time, and remember me.

31:16.417 --> 31:19.545
If a man die,
shall he live again?

31:19.628 --> 31:22.172
All the days of my appointed
time will I wait,

31:22.256 --> 31:24.008
-till my change come.
-[bird squawking]

31:24.091 --> 31:26.677
Thou shalt call,
and I will answer thee.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.387
[McSween] Thou wilt have
a desire to the work

31:28.470 --> 31:31.682
of thine hands.
For now thou numberest my steps.

31:31.765 --> 31:34.101
Dost thou not watch over my sin?

31:34.184 --> 31:36.604
My transgression
is sealed up in a bag,

31:36.687 --> 31:38.856
and thou sewest up
mine iniquity.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.692
And surely the mountains
falling cometh to nought,

31:41.775 --> 31:43.277
and the rock is removed...

31:43.360 --> 31:45.112
[indistinct chatter]

31:45.195 --> 31:48.198
[McSween] Gentlemen, please,
let's have some order!

31:48.282 --> 31:51.076
[clears throat]
Thank you.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.247
I have to tell you
that our first duty

31:55.331 --> 31:57.082
is to try and find
a legal solution,

31:57.166 --> 31:59.585
rather than take the law
into our own hands.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.254
So tomorrow, I will charge
all the members

32:02.338 --> 32:03.964
of Sheriff's Brady's posse,
as well as Riley

32:04.048 --> 32:05.382
and Murphy of the House,

32:05.466 --> 32:08.385
with complicity in the murder
of John Tunstall.

32:08.469 --> 32:10.888
I will also demand the return
of Tunstall's store

32:10.971 --> 32:12.389
to myself and Mr. Brewer.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.932
Mr. McSween!

32:15.059 --> 32:18.270
I understand your faith
in the due process of the law,

32:18.354 --> 32:20.230
but I do not share it.

32:20.314 --> 32:22.941
Not here in Lincoln.
Not in New Mexico.

32:25.736 --> 32:28.739
It is clear to all of us
that Sheriff Brady,

32:28.822 --> 32:30.240
along with the courts
of Santa Fe

32:30.324 --> 32:32.493
and all the other lawmakers
are corrupt,

32:32.576 --> 32:34.828
and no longer deserve our trust.

32:34.912 --> 32:37.790
Billy, I beg you.
We need the law on our side.

32:37.873 --> 32:40.959
What law, McSween?
There is no law.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.753
It is just us.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.255
And what we're decided
upon is a pledge

32:45.339 --> 32:47.966
to form a fighting force,
to take this war to the House.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.593
[all agreeing]

32:49.677 --> 32:52.137
And we should call ourselves
the Regulators.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.139
That's those who assemble
to regulate

32:54.223 --> 32:57.768
or set to right an intolerable
or illegal situation.

32:57.851 --> 33:01.480
We nominate Billy
to be our leader.

33:01.563 --> 33:02.856
[Waite] Here. Here.

33:05.943 --> 33:06.985
Now's the time.

33:09.697 --> 33:10.823
Okay.

33:14.952 --> 33:19.039
I'll lead you
and we'll fight like hell.

33:19.123 --> 33:22.209
But I will not ask you to do
anything I wouldn't do myself.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.756
We're in this together.
It's the only way.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.635
I understand
what's been decided.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.054
And, and I can understand why.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.308
But I want you all to appreciate
that if you respond

33:38.392 --> 33:41.645
to this act of violence
in kind,

33:41.729 --> 33:43.731
there will be no turning back,

33:43.814 --> 33:46.692
and there will be
a lot of bloodshed.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.531
Then let there be bloodshed.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.641
[Billy] Gracias.

34:29.443 --> 34:30.402
Billy.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.447
I just heard about
Señor Tunstall.

34:35.324 --> 34:38.494
I'm so sorry.
I know what he meant to you.

34:40.788 --> 34:41.996
Come inside.

34:49.295 --> 34:52.090
Billy, this is my brother,
Yginio.

34:52.174 --> 34:54.134
-Hola.
-How do you do?

34:54.217 --> 34:55.385
Fine, thank you.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.094
[in Spanish]

35:16.740 --> 35:18.826
[breathing heavily]

35:21.662 --> 35:23.038
[in English] What is it?

35:31.380 --> 35:33.131
I love you.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.009
I love you too.

35:38.595 --> 35:39.680
What?

35:40.931 --> 35:44.810
The life I'd hoped for,
the future I pray for,

35:44.893 --> 35:46.270
it's all gone.

35:46.353 --> 35:49.064
[scoffs]
What are you saying?

35:51.567 --> 35:52.693
I...

35:54.027 --> 35:56.446
I have to kill the men
who murdered Tunstall.

35:56.530 --> 35:59.032
[scoffs]
You don't have to!

35:59.116 --> 36:01.660
They will be arrested.
Put in jail. Hanged.

36:02.244 --> 36:03.245
Not here.

36:04.538 --> 36:05.831
There's no law here.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.544
If I want justice, I have to
take the law into my own hands.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.504
So, you'd be an outlaw again?

36:12.588 --> 36:14.464
A wanted man.

36:14.548 --> 36:16.300
Even if you live,
you won't have any peace,

36:16.383 --> 36:18.302
they'll hunt you down.
Is that what you want?

36:18.385 --> 36:20.345
No, it's not what I want.
But I don't have a choice.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.474
Look, I know I can't get
your blessing on this,

36:24.558 --> 36:26.059
but I need your understanding.

36:26.143 --> 36:28.478
Well, I can't understand.
You told me you'd changed.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.647
I wanted to be with you,
and now, it's all gone.

36:30.731 --> 36:31.982
No wait.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.525
[gasps]

36:36.612 --> 36:37.988
Please!

36:38.071 --> 36:39.531
No. No.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.242
Please go. Now!

36:47.748 --> 36:49.207
[in Spanish]

36:55.297 --> 36:57.799
[dramatic music]

37:03.263 --> 37:04.765
[in English] The next time
I'll see your face

37:04.848 --> 37:06.099
will be on a "wanted" poster.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.079
[sighing]

37:27.162 --> 37:29.414
[indistinct chatter]

37:48.141 --> 37:49.267
[Tom] Hey, John.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.563
-Who's that?
-[Tom] My name's Tom O'Folliard.

37:53.647 --> 37:55.273
I've got some news
you might wanna hear

37:55.357 --> 37:57.526
-about Billy the Kid.
-[Beckwith] What kind of news?

37:58.819 --> 38:01.321
-[Tom] What's it worth to you?
-[gasps]

38:02.906 --> 38:05.283
I'm not gonna tell you
if you're gonna shoot me.

38:05.367 --> 38:06.785
Well, I ain't gonna shoot ya.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.332
Tell me what you got.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.127
[grunts]

38:16.670 --> 38:18.755
Don't make a fuckin' noise
or you're dead.

38:18.839 --> 38:19.965
Now get the fuck up.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.300
[grunting]

38:22.384 --> 38:24.261
Shh. Shush now.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.512
[panting]

38:25.595 --> 38:27.472
Now, I don't want
to hurt you, Beckwith.

38:28.432 --> 38:30.308
No, let me put that another way.

38:30.392 --> 38:32.978
I wouldn't mind, but I won't

38:33.061 --> 38:35.814
as long as you give us
the information we need.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.608
[panting]
I ain't telling you shit!

38:38.692 --> 38:39.985
[grunting]

38:42.029 --> 38:43.363
Now, I just want to know
the names

38:43.447 --> 38:44.823
of those who killed Tunstall.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.784
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.369
Sure you know, Beckwith.

38:49.453 --> 38:52.497
I'll give you five seconds
and that's it.

38:53.206 --> 38:58.295
-[gun cocking]
-5, 4, 3,

38:58.378 --> 39:01.173
2, 1...

39:20.400 --> 39:21.610
Got the names.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.946
The ones who killed Tunstall.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.825
It was Baker,
Morton and Olinger.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.368
Not Jesse?

39:32.579 --> 39:33.747
I don't know.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.374
Beckwith says not.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.003
First, we see if McSween has
made any progress in the courts.

39:40.087 --> 39:41.338
And then?

39:41.421 --> 39:44.549
And then... we'll see.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.388
[insects chirping]

39:56.186 --> 39:57.562
[Billy] Hey.

39:57.646 --> 39:58.563
[indistinct]

40:11.368 --> 40:12.619
Billy.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.289
[sighing]

40:16.373 --> 40:17.791
What is it, McSween?

40:17.874 --> 40:19.918
All Judge Wilson was able
to secure was the return

40:20.001 --> 40:22.045
of Tunstall's store
to its original owners.

40:22.129 --> 40:24.464
As far as the criminal charges
are concerned,

40:24.548 --> 40:28.051
no less a person than State
Governor Axtell has intervened.

40:28.135 --> 40:29.928
Oh, this is bullshit.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.763
I'm sorry, Billy.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.141
The law has let us down.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.769
The corruption shouldn't come
as a surprise to you, Alexander.

40:37.853 --> 40:39.771
And they'll be gunning
for you now as well.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.817
I suggest the two of you
leave Lincoln.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.318
-But...
-No, dear. No.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.280
We have to listen to Billy now.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.906
You know all of this started
with them stealing

40:49.990 --> 40:51.116
Tunstall's horses.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.077
So I say we send them
a fuckin' message

40:54.161 --> 40:55.829
and take back what's ours.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.956
I know where Jesse's
gang is holding them.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.375
They're with Morton.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.170
Morton?

41:06.339 --> 41:07.632
[scoffs]

41:12.345 --> 41:14.389
So the Regulators
ride over there.

41:15.724 --> 41:18.059
And we reclaim
our legal property.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.855
[neighing]

41:26.902 --> 41:28.361
[neighing]

41:29.613 --> 41:31.239
Those are our horses.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.950
[Billy] That's Baker
with his horse.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.827
Pretty sure that's
Morton with him.

41:38.580 --> 41:39.915
[Baker] That's Billy's gang!

41:40.707 --> 41:43.418
Juan, you secure the horses.
Let's go.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.215
[neighing in the distance]

41:48.298 --> 41:49.549
Morton!

41:53.803 --> 41:55.513
Hiya, hiya!

41:57.390 --> 41:59.351
[Billy] Hiya! Come on!

42:08.902 --> 42:11.404
[exclaiming]

42:11.488 --> 42:14.032

42:48.108 --> 42:51.653
Morton! The horse is done.

42:54.823 --> 42:57.409
-[gunshot]
-Whoa!

43:01.037 --> 43:03.248
[Baker] Ride, ride, ride, ride!

43:04.874 --> 43:07.085
[grunting]

43:13.508 --> 43:15.510
[neighing]

43:34.362 --> 43:37.615
Charlie, Middleton,
flank them on the left.

43:37.699 --> 43:38.783
[Billy] Cover.

43:38.867 --> 43:40.452
[indistinct chatter]

43:42.203 --> 43:43.955
[Middleton] Ah!
I'm hit, I'm hit.

43:46.708 --> 43:48.001
Hold your fire.

43:48.835 --> 43:49.961
Billy!

43:51.921 --> 43:53.840
Morton and Baker!

43:56.259 --> 43:58.136
You got no chance!

43:58.219 --> 44:00.638
Throw your weapons down
and come out with your hands up.

44:02.015 --> 44:05.769
Surrender now and I promise you
safe passage back to Lincoln.

44:05.852 --> 44:07.145
I don't believe that.

44:08.438 --> 44:10.857
Billy's not gonna
let us walk away.

44:10.940 --> 44:12.650
[Brewer] You have my word.

44:12.734 --> 44:15.570
Now throw out your guns
and come on out!

44:24.412 --> 44:26.706
All right, we're coming out
now. Don't shoot.

44:26.790 --> 44:28.666
Goddamit.

44:46.226 --> 44:49.396
[gunshots]

44:52.065 --> 44:53.858
[sighing]

44:58.655 --> 45:00.490
We're the law in Lincoln now.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.700

45:03.743 --> 45:06.704
