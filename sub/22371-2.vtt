(music playing)

01:35.971 --> 01:37.962
(indistinct conversations)

01:40.726 --> 01:43.639
Let's hurry it up, fishies.
We got our pants down out here.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.936
It's only like a dozen.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.520
- Yeah, I mean--
- Huck.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.319
Relieve Todd at the maintenance station.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.816
- Hey, Mara--
- Shut up.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.738
Give me your gun.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.030
How's that feel?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.578
- It, uh, feels--
- Shut up.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.746
Go inside. Get the coolers.
Start packing up.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.540
(sighs)

02:06.627 --> 02:08.538
Hey, genius.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.458
Sorry.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.290
Go.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.137
(static crackles)

02:24.227 --> 02:25.638
Little Roy.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.022
(static crackles)

02:31.109 --> 02:33.020
Little Roy, it's Mara. You copy?

02:36.782 --> 02:38.022
(static crackles)

02:38.116 --> 02:40.483
J-Top, it's Mara. You copy?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.579
(static crackles)

02:45.666 --> 02:46.906
Todd?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.452
Todd: Yeah?

02:53.215 --> 02:54.376
(static crackles)

02:54.466 --> 02:56.798
Lock the stairwell, every floor.

02:57.928 --> 02:58.918
<i>Why?</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:03.756
(indistinct shouting)

03:16.196 --> 03:17.857
(theme music playing)

03:57.237 --> 03:59.228
(walkers growling)

04:06.663 --> 04:10.622
Looks like they made themselves a moat.

04:10.709 --> 04:16.000
(sighs) I guess we shouldn't be
surprised, considering.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.672
We can do this. We did before.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.801
Jesus: Yeah.
That's what I was considering.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.970
I wasn't here before.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.761
Just need a clear shot.
Right, Dianne?

04:30.562 --> 04:32.098
Just a few seconds.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.146
So we just need to time it right.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.396
They see us, they fire a gun,

04:38.487 --> 04:39.773
we're not getting in.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.360
Don't let them fire a gun, Dianne.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.994
Morgan, do you need us
to cover you or something?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.324
I do not.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.628
Hey, we're here to help.
It shouldn't just be you.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.876
I don't die.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.092
(growling continues)

05:18.652 --> 05:19.892
Woman: Your majesty!

05:19.986 --> 05:21.897
Man: Where is he?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.945
Find the King!

05:28.578 --> 05:31.070
(walkers growling)

05:56.857 --> 05:58.643
Ezekiel:
The damned are upon us!

06:00.777 --> 06:01.938
Protect the King!

06:02.028 --> 06:03.644
Protect yourselves!

06:03.738 --> 06:05.649
(gunfire)

06:05.740 --> 06:07.026
(grunts)

06:23.717 --> 06:25.674
Anyone see where he went?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.089
He saw us.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.425
If he tells them we're here,
it's over before it started.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.556
It is not, and he won't,

06:36.646 --> 06:39.980
for we together will find him, end him,

06:40.066 --> 06:42.478
and fulfill the promise
of what we have begun.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.559
(round chambers)

06:43.653 --> 06:45.860
Trust the King.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.985
Outpost is due north,
through the woods.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.067
As that's surely his course,
so shall it be ours.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.620
If our comrades had already arrived,
they'd have been here.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.824
Return to the staging area.
Gather the others when they land.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.501
And if they haven't yet,
release Shiva from her cage.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.919
Due north.
We'll leave a trail for you.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.498
Ensure no enemies remain
in these environs,

07:05.592 --> 07:07.754
and be not ten minutes behind. Go.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.256
- Onward!
- Whoo!

07:10.347 --> 07:13.635
To our foe, then to his compound,

07:13.725 --> 07:15.636
then to certain victory.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.252
Spread out! Watch for breaches!

07:44.339 --> 07:47.172
We keep 'em locked in,
they got bigger problems than us.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.928
I can hear the shooting.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.220
- (static crackles)
- Mara on radio: Stay where you are.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.218
<i>- Do not say another word.
- (gunshots)</i>

08:04.526 --> 08:06.437
(whistles)

08:06.528 --> 08:08.519
(gunfire continues in distance)

08:19.082 --> 08:21.790
You signal if they're already inside.
We'll be there.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.959
Come on. Let's find them guns.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.602
Dino, we need an opening.
Find one or make one.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.938
(walkers growling)

08:54.242 --> 08:56.233
(fence rattling)

09:15.055 --> 09:16.966
What the hell?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.798
- Hey!
- (silenced gunshots)

10:00.016 --> 10:01.302

(indistinct conversations)

11:16.634 --> 11:18.671
- (gasps)
- Ain't on this floor.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.468
Only option is up.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.466
High ground. Good cover.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.389
Yeah, I'd put 'em up there, too.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.590
Stairs.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.642
(door rattling)

11:48.499 --> 11:50.115
They're too chickenshit to move in on us.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.167
We push them back! Go!

12:11.564 --> 12:13.726
We got some coming up on my right.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.399
Stay on them! Don't let them through!

12:16.486 --> 12:18.944
We pin them in, it takes care of itself!
That's the plan!

12:50.895 --> 12:52.761
Tobin, move in!

12:52.855 --> 12:55.017
I can take them! Cover me!

12:55.108 --> 12:58.351
- No! Wait for Tobin!
- There's no time!

12:59.654 --> 13:02.567
Go! I'll help cover you!

13:09.956 --> 13:12.038
(indistinct conversations)

14:03.176 --> 14:05.417
(metal creaking)

14:12.727 --> 14:14.718
(breathing heavily)

14:20.026 --> 14:22.017
(rapid gunfire in distance)

14:26.491 --> 14:29.028
Last floor.
The guns have gotta be up here.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.234
He said they'd be here.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.445
Everything else he passed you
is checking out.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.906
That guy's a piece of shit.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.490
Those guns get to the Sanctuary,

14:37.585 --> 14:40.077
they could cut through those
walkers and free up an exit.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.543
We'll go faster if we split up.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.045
I find the M2s, you find 'em,
we use them,

14:46.135 --> 14:47.921
hit the courtyard right then and there.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.094
End this quick.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.653
Please! Please don't shoot me!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.150
(crying) Shit.
Please don't shoot me.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.232
- Please don't...
- Tara: Huh.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.159
Oh, look, you pissed your pants.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.907
L-I'm not one of them.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.284
Uh, m-my name's Dean.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.831
Why are you still talking?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.831
Jesus: Tara, wait.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.539
- Just wait.
- Tara: For what?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.089
He has his hands up, Tara.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.508
We have a job to do.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.132
(rapid gunfire in distance)

15:32.223 --> 15:34.430
You want to go check that out?

15:35.601 --> 15:37.933
(sighs)

15:38.020 --> 15:40.808
(rapid gunfire)

15:46.279 --> 15:47.769
We're missing some people
from the other team.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.400
Morgan?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.192
Come out.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.119
(gunfire continues)

16:00.209 --> 16:03.167
Just stay in there.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.540
We're on top of each other here.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.791
We'll signal you when it's clear.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.793
Just be ready.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.262
I got it, Jesus. Step aside.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.464
Tara.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.049
There's a firefight outside.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.225
We don't even know if Morgan's alive.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.723
Dean:
Please, lady. I'm not one of them.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.395
You're here. You had a gun.
You are one of them.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.223
I'm not. I'm not.
You got to believe me.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.776
- Then what are you doing here?
- I'm just a worker.

16:27.862 --> 16:31.480
They brought me from the Sanctuary
to cook, clean, whatever.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.156
They did not give me a choice.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.109
They made me leave my wife and kids.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.117
(breathing heavily)

16:39.207 --> 16:42.325
Your people do this
to the Sanctuary, too?

16:43.586 --> 16:46.920
- The families okay?
- We don't want to hurt the workers.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.588
- We're not going to.
- You believe him?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.130
It's not about him.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.253
I'm not gonna shoot someone
with their hands up,

16:51.344 --> 16:53.005
and I'm not letting you.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.713
These medical supplies--
they're the Hilltop's, right?

16:59.769 --> 17:01.430
Maggie's prenatals.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.888
They took them because they could,

17:03.981 --> 17:05.392
because they don't give a shit.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.598
- So why should we?
- I know they killed your girlfriend...

17:07.693 --> 17:09.275
- Jesus-
- ...that you loved her.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.353
- This isn't you.
- It is now.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.029
We're not here for revenge.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.446
- It can't be about that.
- It can.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.071
_ (Qllnshot)
- Aah!

17:21.123 --> 17:23.285
(breathing heavily)

17:23.376 --> 17:25.959
I wouldn't.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.454
You know what's funny?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.836
Normally I'd peg you as the softie,
not pretty boy.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.969
You know how hard it is
to piss yourself on purpose?

17:37.056 --> 17:40.014
L-It's like your dick knows
you're wearing pants.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.271
Aw, hell, look that.

17:47.358 --> 17:50.191
Well, that shit is ruined.

17:50.278 --> 17:54.613
Well, looks like that dumb bitch
Maggie and her kid

17:54.699 --> 17:56.656
are just gonna die, anyway.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.653
Just like you two.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.611
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Oh, honey, no, you're not.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.663
Then someone else will.
There's too many of us.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.285
See, that's where we differ.

18:05.376 --> 18:06.958
If I take the two of you with me,

18:07.044 --> 18:09.456
then I've got one hell
of an insurance policy.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.163
So why don't you put that thing down

18:11.257 --> 18:13.624
unless you're gonna shoot
through this beautiful man here?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.134
I'm not gonna ask you again.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.211
I think she's gonna shoot you.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.387
I am.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.009
Yeah. She is.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.181
Shut up!

18:22.268 --> 18:23.303
- Tara--
- I can do it.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.930
- Tara, he has a gun to my head.
- Not for long.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.557
Wait. Wait. Wait a second.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.978
- Go to hell.
- Okay.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.308
So... (chuckles)
you really wanna risk it, huh?

18:31.402 --> 18:33.518
Me for him?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.354
Well, I can tell you right now
that I am not worth it.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.780
We can work this out.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.279
L-I may talk a big game
like I'm a tough guy,

18:40.369 --> 18:42.280
but I'm not.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.487
I really just want to...

18:48.294 --> 18:50.410
(coughs)

18:58.846 --> 19:00.428
You're not gonna do it.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.218
Not you.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.390
It's not about revenge.
It's about getting it done.

19:16.197 --> 19:19.280
What the hell are you doing?
He tried to kill us.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.654
I told you-- it's not about him.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.735
So he gets to live?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.989
What about Abraham? Glenn? Denise?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.870
This is different.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.247
You're not Rick. You're not Maggie.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.499
No.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.671
But she'll hear what I have to say.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.420
<i>Man on radio:

Yeah. Follow my lead.

Just keep going! I'm okay!

21:47.473 --> 21:49.214

21:53.813 --> 21:55.850

We don't have time to figure that out.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.902
Compound's not far off.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.578
If he made it,

22:53.664 --> 22:56.201
if they know we're coming,
they're gonna be ready.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.334
Two possibilities, just one fact.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.789
Carol: And what's that?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.125
Ezekiel: We shall be ready regardless.

23:10.097 --> 23:13.761
What's about to happen,
it's not just a few walkers.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.057
You know that, right?

23:15.144 --> 23:18.387
Yes. And yet I smile.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.518
Why?

23:25.529 --> 23:28.442
Do I feel the supreme confidence?

23:28.532 --> 23:31.069
Or is my lot, my job,

23:31.160 --> 23:33.993
to simply protect such certainty?

23:35.414 --> 23:38.076
No and yes.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.158
Yes and no.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.414
And then finally yes to both.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.965
Fake it till you make it, baby.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.173
That's what I've done and what I do.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.964
I am King because
I-l have provided a light

23:55.059 --> 23:57.300
to lead my people forward
through the darkness,

23:57.394 --> 23:59.806
and they have made
my fictions realities.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.272
So, with all this and everything
that's happened--

24:03.359 --> 24:05.691
All of us may not make it.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.769
We may not even win.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.605
And yet I smile.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.237
There will be no fantasies
of failure this day.

24:14.328 --> 24:17.366
Daniel: Hey, guys.
Is this blood from the wasted?

24:25.714 --> 24:27.000
No.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.633
One of us hit him
when we fired on him.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.551
Means he's moving slow.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.254
Hells yeah.

24:34.348 --> 24:35.463
We're back in business.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.390
Well done, Daniel. Well done to us all.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.059
We move forward...

24:41.730 --> 24:44.347
as we move the very world forward.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.988
(floorboard creaks)

27:43.203 --> 27:45.035
(gasping)

27:45.122 --> 27:47.329
The M2s. Where are they?

27:47.416 --> 27:50.158
<i>'</i> NO... guns!
" (gasps)

27:51.670 --> 27:53.160
Grace--.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.791
(breathing heavily)

27:54.882 --> 27:56.247
They're in there?

27:57.384 --> 28:00.172
No! No!

28:00.262 --> 28:01.593
Ohm

28:01.680 --> 28:03.671
(gasping)

28:22.201 --> 28:23.441
(grunts)

28:36.173 --> 28:37.629
- (gunshots)
' (man grunts)

28:37.716 --> 28:40.708
<i>You sure we can do it?</i>

28:40.802 --> 28:43.294
<i>We can beat 'em?</i>

28:52.189 --> 28:55.398
<i>What this group has done,
what we've learned,</i>

28:55.484 --> 28:59.648
<i>what we've become, all of us--
yes, I'm sure.</i>

29:21.218 --> 29:24.961
Circle the door, wide, at least 20 feet.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.420
Guns up, but hold your fire.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.222
- What?
- They're gonna give up.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.969
We only fire if they fire first.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.926
They fire first, one of us dies.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.638
Then let's hope, for my sake,
that they don't.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.144
You can try to stop me.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.478
- (clattering)
- Man: Come on! Go! Move!

29:44.950 --> 29:46.691
Jesus: Drop your weapon!

29:48.620 --> 29:51.362
Drop your weapon and surrender.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.218
- Living sounds good to me.
- (gun clatters)

30:07.180 --> 30:08.386
We're surrounded.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.767
Don't be as dumb as they think we are.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.515
Put your guns down.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.022
(Tara breathing heavily)
It's okay.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.694
We can do it the hard way.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.521
Because even if Maggie listens to you,

30:25.615 --> 30:27.902
Rick will listen to me.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.187
- (man groans)
- (shell casing clinks)

31:22.589 --> 31:26.002
<i>We have to come for them
before they come for us.</i>

31:27.052 --> 31:29.089
<i>We can't leave them alive.</i>

31:32.766 --> 31:35.258
<i>Morgan:
Where there's life, there's possibility.</i>

31:35.352 --> 31:37.844
<i>Rick: Of them hitting us.</i>

31:37.938 --> 31:40.396
Jared: Shit.

31:40.482 --> 31:43.019
I know you.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.692
You get transferred, too?

31:46.321 --> 31:47.811
Morgan!

31:49.282 --> 31:50.943
Lower your gun.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.779
(breathing heavily)

31:55.872 --> 31:57.954
We came here to kill them.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.750
We're supposed to.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.799
They surrendered.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.547
It's not what we do.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.724
Then what do we do, huh?

32:43.503 --> 32:46.837
(floor creaks)

32:46.923 --> 32:48.129
Rick: Hmm.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.838
<i>(waves crashing)</i>

33:09.613 --> 33:11.729
(breathes shakily)

33:18.663 --> 33:22.497
Gracie.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.495
No.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.212
No.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.379
(groans)

33:36.473 --> 33:38.430
(exhales sharply)

33:49.361 --> 33:52.319
(groans)

33:59.287 --> 34:01.278
(birds chirping)

34:17.931 --> 34:19.922
That way.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.641
There!

34:45.333 --> 34:47.449
Save your munitions, Carol.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.958
Our friends have arrived.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.922
(Shiva roars)

34:55.010 --> 34:57.001
(screaming)

35:07.522 --> 35:09.513
(rapid gunfire)

35:32.172 --> 35:34.004
Ahh.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.001
Francine!

35:52.817 --> 35:55.900
(gunfire continues, glass breaking)

36:14.297 --> 36:15.662
(keys clack)

36:15.757 --> 36:17.748
(engine starts)

36:32.023 --> 36:33.605
You okay? You okay?

36:33.692 --> 36:37.902
I'm fine, but our people-- they need...

36:37.987 --> 36:40.354
(breathing heavily)

36:40.448 --> 36:42.689
Oh, God. No.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.070
No, no. no, no, no, no.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.026
No, no. Eric, Eric.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.328
Eric.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.281
Let's go.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.628
Ezekiel:
And there it is-- our certain victory.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.669
(Shiva snarling)

37:07.767 --> 37:11.601
This-- I am not glad for his death.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.474
For anyone's.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.727
I know.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.651
(static crackles)

37:21.156 --> 37:24.524
<i>Man: Nelson, we're on the move,
taking active measures.</i>

37:24.617 --> 37:26.107
<i>Just hole up, keep it elevated,</i>

37:26.202 --> 37:28.284
<i>and if you see us,
stay out of the line of fire.</i>

37:30.749 --> 37:33.332
Jig's up.
Gonna have to break chocks.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.908
No.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.085
This journey will not end in retreat.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.755
But they know we're coming.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.006
Indeed they do.

37:52.812 --> 37:53.973
(chuckles)

38:25.845 --> 38:27.461
Damn it.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.883
Keep your hands down.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.138
Turn around slow.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.860
Hi, Rick.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.033
Your name...

39:00.713 --> 39:02.704
is Morales.

39:05.134 --> 39:08.001
You were in Atlanta.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.089
That was a long time ago.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.805
It's over, Rick.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.021
I called the Saviors back.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.608
And they're coming.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.376
(theme music playing)
