WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:05.672
All right, we have a lot
to get through today, you guys.

00:05.839 --> 00:09.009
Anybody have anything
on page one?

00:09.176 --> 00:14.181
I think we need to change
this Donald Trump joke--

00:14.681 --> 00:18.477
because Donald Trump was eaten
by a lion this morning

00:18.644 --> 00:21.313
on the International Space Station.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.482
Anyone listening?

00:23.649 --> 00:24.441
Yeah, okay, Cerie,

00:24.608 --> 00:26.235
how about instead of
doing the scripts,

00:26.401 --> 00:28.362
why don't you just organize
those videotapes?

00:28.528 --> 00:31.070
Oh, okay.

00:36.573 --> 00:40.661
Okay, actually, could you go downstairs
and get me a chai tea?

00:40.837 --> 00:44.583
Okay.
Um, where are my shoes?

00:47.009 --> 00:48.422
No, no, just go.
Just go barefoot!

00:48.599 --> 00:49.503
Just leave you shoes.

00:49.676 --> 00:51.960
Okay.

00:55.225 --> 00:59.143
We gotta change this
Trump joke.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:18.997 --> 01:20.703
- Mr. Jordan.
- What's up, Ken?

01:20.878 --> 01:22.453
I got your car washed
like you asked.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.660
And I got that "Baby on Board" sign you wanted
to help you get tail.

01:25.837 --> 01:27.541
Thanks, Ken.
You done good.

01:27.716 --> 01:31.210
It's my pleasure and my job, sir.
Anything you ever need, just ask.

01:31.388 --> 01:33.011
But I want you to know something.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.630
You and me, it's not gonna be
a one-way street.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.013
'Cause I don't believe in
one-way streets.

01:39.185 --> 01:42.391
Not between people and
not while I'm driving.

01:42.567 --> 01:43.773
Oh, okay.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.351
So here's some advice I wish I would've got
when I was your age.

01:47.527 --> 01:51.730
Live every week
like it's Shark Week.

01:54.825 --> 01:56.150
Excellent call, guys.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.531
Good old Stan there.
Happy Birthday, Stan.

01:57.708 --> 01:59.872
All right,
we're halfway done.

02:00.045 --> 02:01.623
Let's take a little break.

02:01.786 --> 02:04.292
You guys want to have a
one-minute dance party?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.620
Good idea.

02:05.797 --> 02:06.660
Crank it, Toofer.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.963
* Grown and sexy from your head
down to your toes *

02:09.127 --> 02:11.791
* You know you're fine

02:11.968 --> 02:15.802
* Got that perfect face,
a perfect shape *

02:15.966 --> 02:17.342
* And perfect smile...

02:17.518 --> 02:18.430
Yeah, shake it!
Feel the music.

02:18.595 --> 02:19.892
Ahem!

02:20.055 --> 02:22.223
Oh, Mr. Donaghy!

02:22.398 --> 02:24.971
No, please...
finish your dance.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.482
Oh, we were just
taking a little break.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.981
And we all love the music
of Chamillionaire.

02:30.158 --> 02:30.813
I see.

02:30.988 --> 02:34.111
If you don't mind,
I'll just observe from over here.

02:34.275 --> 02:36.610
You will?
Why?

02:36.785 --> 02:38.900
Are you familiar
with Six Sigma?

02:39.078 --> 02:41.990
Oh, yeah, it's a special kind of
G.I. Joe.

02:42.165 --> 02:43.413
It's Frank, right?

02:43.587 --> 02:44.833
Yes, sir.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.871
Yeah. Frank...

02:47.047 --> 02:51.043
Six Sigma is the elite
GE executive training course.

02:51.218 --> 02:56.802
To master just its basic concepts,
one must brave a five-day conference at a Sheraton.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.631
Six Sigma says that a manager
must understand every aspect

02:59.808 --> 03:01.640
of the business
he or she oversees.

03:01.807 --> 03:02.803
Which means?

03:02.977 --> 03:04.513
I'll be in here every day.

03:04.686 --> 03:05.850
Soaking it up.

03:06.018 --> 03:11.143
So please return to work,
and act like I'm not here.

03:15.115 --> 03:16.531
Okay.

03:16.698 --> 03:19.653
Let's, uh, get into
Toofer's commercial parody.

03:19.827 --> 03:22.363
We were trying to think of
a funnier cereal name.

03:22.536 --> 03:26.583
The favorite options so far include
Honey Bunches of Sadness,

03:26.747 --> 03:30.291
Oat Bung,
and Swaztik-o's.

03:30.665 --> 03:32.001
Fruit Lupus.

03:32.175 --> 03:33.001
No.

03:33.178 --> 03:34.540
Dingleberries.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.500
Fart Nuggets.

03:41.097 --> 03:42.721
I'm sorry.

03:42.896 --> 03:44.433
That's really great.

03:44.607 --> 03:46.560
Okay, let's just think
for another minute.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.143
Frosted Mini Guns.

03:49.315 --> 03:50.811
Lucky Bastards?

03:50.988 --> 03:53.810
If you don't mind, I think
we all really laughed at Fart Nuggets,

03:53.987 --> 03:56.771
so could we just move on,
please.

03:56.948 --> 03:59.742
Every day, huh?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.492
You  guys want coffee?

04:01.657 --> 04:02.913
Oh, yeah.

04:03.078 --> 04:05.121
So I was doing some
research on comedy.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.080
And I came across
the cartoon strip Dilbert.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.160
It's quite good.

04:08.338 --> 04:10.582
And I was wondering
if we could do that.

04:10.756 --> 04:11.960
Do what?

04:12.127 --> 04:14.580
Dilbert.

04:17.427 --> 04:18.380
You guys want coffee?

04:18.555 --> 04:19.421
Oh, yeah.

04:19.596 --> 04:21.551
No, no, no,
you can't say that.

04:21.726 --> 04:23.383
Jeb Bush is a friend
of mine.

04:23.557 --> 04:25.222
Who should I change it to?

04:25.397 --> 04:27.853
Sean Penn--
No, Barbra Streisand.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.642
He guns it.
Girl falls into the water.

04:29.815 --> 04:30.773
You guys want coffee?

04:30.936 --> 04:33.060
So we circle back
looking for her.

04:33.235 --> 04:34.442
Remember, it's pitch black out.

04:34.606 --> 04:37.022
The boat hits something hard.

04:37.196 --> 04:40.571
And you hear kind of...

04:41.246 --> 04:44.702
And Brokaw says, "Just go.
Don't look back."

04:44.866 --> 04:50.292
Now...I'm not a writer,
but maybe there's a skit in that.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.880
Hey. What?

05:00.057 --> 05:01.551
So is Donaghy gonna be
in the room again today?

05:01.716 --> 05:03.172
Ugh. Probably, yeah.

05:03.348 --> 05:04.551
Well, you have to say
something to him.

05:04.725 --> 05:06.341
You guys are not getting
any work done.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.013
Really?

05:07.185 --> 05:09.221
You don't think his idea
of starting with the catchphrases

05:09.398 --> 05:11.470
and working backwards
is panning out?

05:11.645 --> 05:14.942
"Nuts to you, McGullicuty."

05:15.106 --> 05:18.402
"Who ordered the wieners?"

05:18.567 --> 05:20.772
Beep beep!
Ribby ribby!

05:20.948 --> 05:26.413
Actually, Frank wrote a draft
of "Beep beep, ribby ribby."

05:29.377 --> 05:33.041
Look, you have to say something to Jack soon,
or your writers are going to revolt.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.450
What do you all
not understand?

05:34.628 --> 05:35.661
He's our boss.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.541
Me trying to tell Jack what to do
would be like you trying to boss around--

05:39.716 --> 05:42.250
Which one of your kids is it
that you're afraid of?

05:42.425 --> 05:45.093
Kyle.
Kyle.

05:45.766 --> 05:47.890
So strong.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.930
Oh, come on!

05:50.106 --> 05:51.351
That was a jacket.

05:51.515 --> 05:53.063
That's it, I've gotta talk to her
about her clothes.

05:53.225 --> 05:54.102
She can't dress like that.

05:54.275 --> 05:55.023
Yes, she can.

05:55.185 --> 05:56.061
People like the way she dresses.

05:56.235 --> 05:57.903
Oh, come on, it's distracting.
It's inappropriate.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.560
You're  inappropriate, you jerk,
with your big stupid face!

06:00.735 --> 06:03.232
- Come on.
- Liz, listen, listen, listen.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.531
Look at me.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.821
Look how bald I am.
Look at my life.

06:06.997 --> 06:08.741
Please,  just give me
this one thing.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.071
Pete, no, come on!
I'm talking to her.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.491
Talk to yourself!

06:12.668 --> 06:14.912
Cha!

06:18.966 --> 06:21.501
Kenny, my boy.
What's the frequency, Ken?

06:21.678 --> 06:23.210
Yeah, I need you to grab me some lunch.

06:23.387 --> 06:24.921
Absolutely.
What can I get for you?

06:25.095 --> 06:26.721
- I want nachos.
- Yes, sir.

06:26.885 --> 06:28.471
From Yankee Stadium.

06:28.636 --> 06:30.890
Yes, sir!

06:31.058 --> 06:33.602
General testing
for United Nations Bloopers.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.720
Oh, hey, Cerie.

06:34.896 --> 06:36.560
Kind of need to talk to you
about something.

06:36.733 --> 06:37.641
Do you have a second?

06:37.817 --> 06:39.943
Sure.

06:40.109 --> 06:46.362
Okay, this is gonna sound really weird,
but, um...you need to wear a bra.

06:46.539 --> 06:48.531
Oh, no,
I don't actually.

06:48.707 --> 06:51.531
They kind of just stay up
on their own.

06:51.708 --> 06:52.620
See? Yeah, okay.

06:52.788 --> 06:56.952
What I'm saying is,
you need to wear a bra to work

06:57.127 --> 06:59.831
if you want to be taken seriously
in this business.

07:00.008 --> 07:03.133
No, but I don't actually want to
work in television.

07:03.297 --> 07:07.011
Career-wise, I'm just gonna marry rich
and then design handbags.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.133
Here's the thing.

07:08.308 --> 07:13.601
The way that you dress is making some people
around the office uncomfortable.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.891
Really?
Who?

07:15.065 --> 07:17.471
Not me!

07:17.897 --> 07:20.852
I guess it's mostly me
that has the problem with it.

07:21.027 --> 07:24.192
Oh, because you have, like,
one of those body image things?

07:24.368 --> 07:25.480
No, it's not that.

07:25.657 --> 07:29.073
Good, because I was gonna say
you still have a good body.

07:29.247 --> 07:31.322
Well, thank you,
but this isn't about me.

07:31.495 --> 07:33.951
Like, how did you dress
before you were married?

07:34.126 --> 07:35.452
I'm not married, Cerie.

07:35.627 --> 07:38.291
Oh, for some reason,
I thought you had, like, three kids.

07:38.455 --> 07:39.331
Nope.

07:39.505 --> 07:41.083
Never married,
no kids.

07:41.257 --> 07:44.421
'Cause sometimes you have, like,
food stains on your shirt and stuff.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.380
I just assumed that it was kids.

07:46.557 --> 07:47.342
You know what?

07:47.505 --> 07:51.803
Forget I mentioned it.
You look great.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.182
Is it my birthday?

07:57.358 --> 07:59.522
You have to get Donaghy
out of the room.

07:59.696 --> 08:02.983
Boy, we as a group
might not smell great.

08:03.156 --> 08:04.023
Come on,
he's stifling us.

08:04.197 --> 08:07.020
I feel like I just can't
be myself around him.

08:07.197 --> 08:11.651
Yeah, Tracy's downstairs right now
rehearsing the best thing we've written all week.

08:11.828 --> 08:15.202
Beep beep! Ribby ribby!

08:15.628 --> 08:18.200
All right.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.162
Ugh.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.830
All right.
I'll take care of it.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.711
Thanks, Liz.

08:28.965 --> 08:30.131
Hey, Mr. Donaghy.

08:30.307 --> 08:30.961
Sorry I'm late.

08:31.137 --> 08:33.553
I was at a luncheon for
Ann Coulter's 60th birthday.

08:33.726 --> 08:34.383
Oh, yeah.

08:34.558 --> 08:38.312
Listen, it's been really great
having you in the room these last few days--

08:38.477 --> 08:41.232
Oh, it's been great for me, too.
Being around all this creativity.

08:41.398 --> 08:44.270
I'll tell you, in the beginning
I thought it was gonna be a bit of a chore honestly,

08:44.448 --> 08:46.810
but now--
Oh, I have an idea for you.

08:46.988 --> 08:48.982
Monkey Senate.
We open on the Capitol--

08:49.158 --> 08:51.153
You can't be in here anymore!

08:51.325 --> 08:51.993
What's that?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.281
It's not working.
You're driving everybody crazy.

08:54.456 --> 09:01.160
And, okay, you can just fire me now,
and I will go back to teaching improv to senior citizens.

09:01.335 --> 09:05.171
Why would I want to fire you?
This is fine.

09:05.338 --> 09:11.962
Six Sigma values direct and honest communication
between coworkers, so, uh...

09:12.845 --> 09:13.971
Thank you, Liz.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.683
Oh, sure.

09:16.845 --> 09:19.261
I'll just, uh,
head upstairs now.

09:19.437 --> 09:23.313
Okay, well, thank you for
being so understanding.

09:23.488 --> 09:26.143
Absolutely.

09:41.587 --> 09:43.250
Oh, no.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.170
I will not let you down, sir.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.392
Go get help, girl.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.651
Hey, Jonathan,
I left a bunch of messages for Jack,

10:10.815 --> 10:12.233
but I haven't heard back.
Do you know if he got them?

10:12.405 --> 10:14.823
Mr.  Donaghy's been very busy.

10:14.996 --> 10:17.611
Well, I just--I really need him
to approve this budget.

10:17.787 --> 10:19.111
Well, I'm sorry.

10:19.288 --> 10:24.202
He's out of the country
till the end of the week.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.330
You want to know another key
to success?

10:29.507 --> 10:30.791
I do, Mr. Jordan.

10:30.966 --> 10:36.801
Dress every day like you're gonna
get murdered in those clothes.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.132
You did real good the other day
with those nachos,

10:39.307 --> 10:43.220
but I need you to do something
of a different nature.

10:43.397 --> 10:46.563
Would you agree when I say
that a man's freedom only exists

10:46.735 --> 10:49.942
when he's free
to pursue his desires?

10:50.105 --> 10:51.562
Yes, I suppose I would.

10:51.738 --> 10:55.900
Which means when the law conflicts
with our desires,

10:56.077 --> 11:00.281
then we must operate
outside the law.

11:01.576 --> 11:04.163
You following me?

11:04.336 --> 11:08.621
Otherwise, we would
no longer be free.

11:10.298 --> 11:13.500
Now I got a mission for you.

11:13.677 --> 11:14.710
Hey, Liz!

11:14.887 --> 11:17.381
I took your advice.
I'm wearing a bra.

11:17.557 --> 11:18.922
That's great, Cerie.

11:19.097 --> 11:20.883
Uh, Liz, can I speak
to you for a second?

11:21.058 --> 11:23.350
Sure.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.563
What's going on?

11:24.728 --> 11:27.181
Mr. Donaghy is very upset
that you banned him from the writers' room.

11:27.355 --> 11:29.182
He wants you to apologize.

11:29.357 --> 11:30.271
Really?

11:30.448 --> 11:32.652
But when you apologize, you have to act
like it was your idea.

11:32.816 --> 11:34.273
He can't know that I told you.

11:34.446 --> 11:37.483
But he sent you here
to tell me to apologize.

11:37.656 --> 11:40.240
Exactly.
I penciled you in for 3:00.

11:40.405 --> 11:44.371
This conversation never happened.

11:44.587 --> 11:50.373
Jenna, set yourself, please,
for Who Wants to Eat a Dictionary?

11:51.337 --> 11:54.291
Where's Kenneth?

12:07.186 --> 12:08.182
Who is it?

12:08.358 --> 12:10.393
It's Kenneth from
the NBC page program.

12:10.567 --> 12:14.860
I'm here for a pickup
from Qiang Deng.

12:16.948 --> 12:18.111
Hello, gentlemen.

12:18.288 --> 12:20.071
Oh, thank goodness.
Air conditioning.

12:20.245 --> 12:21.573
Ooh, what does
that tattoo mean?

12:21.747 --> 12:23.783
When I get nervous,
I ask a lot of questions.

12:23.955 --> 12:25.662
Do y'all have
a bathroom I could use?

12:25.827 --> 12:27.532
Y'all have long fingernails.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.870
Now do y'all rent this space,
or do you own it?

12:30.048 --> 12:32.662
Hey, that's
a funny-looking fish.

12:32.837 --> 12:34.923
What is that,
like a grapefruit knife?

12:35.085 --> 12:37.673
Do you have a cell phone?
What's your plan?

12:37.845 --> 12:40.050
This apology thing is interesting.

12:40.218 --> 12:44.221
Ugh, even when it's something normal
I hate going up to Jack's office.

12:44.385 --> 12:46.353
I always feel like
I'm entering the Death Star.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.183
I expect to see Stormtroopers.

12:48.358 --> 12:50.271
I tell you,
if Donaghy does this at me,

12:50.436 --> 12:51.393
I will run.

12:51.568 --> 12:53.443
You'll be fine...
Captain Needa.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.151
No, Captain Needa dies.
He dies!

12:57.317 --> 13:00.233
* There's no business
like show business *

13:00.408 --> 13:03.532
* Like no business I know

13:03.707 --> 13:06.951
* Everything about it
is appealing *

13:07.126 --> 13:10.411
* Everything the traffic will allow *

13:10.588 --> 13:13.460
* Nowhere can you get
that special feeling *

13:13.625 --> 13:18.253
* Than when you're stealing
that extra bow *

13:22.428 --> 13:23.170
What can I do for you?

13:23.346 --> 13:25.130
I'm on a helicopter
in 15 minutes.

13:25.308 --> 13:29.682
Uh, well, sir,
I just wanted to say, um,

13:30.017 --> 13:32.430
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings
the other day

13:32.605 --> 13:34.690
when I asked you to stay out
of the writers' room.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.103
That's  absurd.
Completely unnecessary.

13:37.278 --> 13:38.480
I haven't given it
a second thought.

13:38.658 --> 13:41.782
Okay, good, 'cause, you know, the writers,
they see you as management--

13:41.945 --> 13:44.901
Please, it's water
under the bridge.

13:45.078 --> 13:49.580
Stop worrying and just
go on back to work.

13:51.545 --> 13:55.250
Of course, I can understand how you might think
my feelings were hurt.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.710
No one wants to hear
that people don't like you.

13:57.886 --> 13:58.582
What, no?

13:58.758 --> 14:00.673
No, that's not at
all what I was saying before.

14:00.847 --> 14:02.461
I never said that people
don't like you.

14:02.638 --> 14:03.461
That's not true.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.180
So, people do like me?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.342
Yes, people like you.

14:08.516 --> 14:11.392
Do you like me?

14:11.566 --> 14:12.762
Of course.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.933
I like you.
Jack.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.190
You know what
I like about you?

14:17.358 --> 14:19.401
Mmm.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.150
Your eyes.

14:21.328 --> 14:25.360
You have those
black shark's eyes.

14:26.876 --> 14:28.450
You know?
Very intense.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.413
Thank you.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.122
Anyway...

14:42.888 --> 14:44.922
You done good, kid.

14:45.096 --> 14:47.842
That thing ever goes missing
and gets into the public water system,

14:48.015 --> 14:49.052
we don't know each other.

14:49.227 --> 14:49.681
Got it.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.433
I got one little errand
for you to run.

14:51.607 --> 14:54.682
Tomorrow's my anniversary,
and I almost forgot about it.

14:54.855 --> 14:57.483
But what did I tell you was the secret
to having a good marriage

14:57.645 --> 14:59.313
and keeping it together,
Kenneth?

14:59.487 --> 15:03.731
Be a good listener, a giver of gifts,
and work that va-jay-jay.

15:03.907 --> 15:05.573
That's my boy!

15:05.736 --> 15:10.322
That's why I want you
to go see my jeweler.

15:14.378 --> 15:15.332
Good morning, Liz.

15:15.496 --> 15:17.290
Oh, hi, Mr. Donaghy.
How are you?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.000
Fine, thank you.

15:18.168 --> 15:22.502
I remember you mentioning what a big fan you are
of the rapper Chamillionaire.

15:22.675 --> 15:24.843
'Cause I was dancing
with Frank?

15:25.007 --> 15:27.970
Oh, yes, yeah.
I love Chamillionaire.

15:28.137 --> 15:31.431
Well, it just so happens that he's performing
this weekend at Webster Hall,

15:31.596 --> 15:35.601
and I got some VIP tickets
and backstage passes.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.722
You could take the writers
or a lady friend.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.140
Whatever.
Enjoy yourself.

15:39.315 --> 15:41.853
You deserve it.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.151
Wow. Thank you.

15:43.315 --> 15:44.570
That's very thoughtful.

15:44.737 --> 15:47.571
Well, I think that coworkers should have
good personal relationships.

15:47.736 --> 15:51.450
I know we've had some missteps,
but we've put all that behind us.

15:51.616 --> 15:55.332
And I'd like us to be...
friendly.

15:55.495 --> 15:58.500
Yeah, absolutely.
Yes, so do I.

15:58.668 --> 16:01.542
Wow, I just can't believe
Chamillionaire tickets were still available.

16:01.717 --> 16:04.251
Ah, well.

16:05.045 --> 16:07.423
See ya.

16:07.595 --> 16:11.880
Josh to stage, please,
for Homophobic Hague.

16:12.056 --> 16:12.892
What was that about?

16:13.056 --> 16:14.760
Just talking to my "bud,"
Jack Donaghy.

16:14.938 --> 16:15.801
Bud, really?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.601
Yes, he said he wants us
to be friends.

16:17.766 --> 16:19.143
He gave me Chamillionaire tickets.

16:19.316 --> 16:21.062
And he even did this to me.

16:21.236 --> 16:23.733
Wow, look, having Jack on your side
can only make life easier.

16:23.907 --> 16:25.402
It's good for everybody
if he wants to be friends.

16:25.566 --> 16:26.362
I know, but it's so weird.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.653
It's like that scene
where you see the back

16:27.827 --> 16:29.320
of Darth Vader's head
with his helmet off,

16:29.485 --> 16:31.823
and you're like,
"Oh! He's a human being!"

16:31.995 --> 16:33.111
I gotta get some new DVDs.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.411
Did we just go in a circle?

16:34.578 --> 16:35.573
Yeah. I was following you.

16:35.748 --> 16:36.371
I was following you.

16:36.535 --> 16:37.663
No, I'm going to wardrobe.

16:37.836 --> 16:41.331
Okay, good walk and talk.

16:42.757 --> 16:45.961
Lee, can I check costumes
for the cold open?

16:46.137 --> 16:48.381
That looks fierce.

16:48.556 --> 16:49.250
Hey, Liz.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.973
Cerie, seriously,
take that off.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.220
And you,
stop encouraging her.

16:54.385 --> 16:55.392
You're an enabler.

16:55.557 --> 16:58.353
You need to dress
like you have a job.

16:58.518 --> 17:04.021
And parents who raised you
in some kind of shamed-based American religious tradition.

17:04.198 --> 17:06.310
Here.

17:06.488 --> 17:08.152
I can make this hot.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.692
Now I get to pick out
what I think you'd look good in.

17:10.867 --> 17:13.862
Oh, I'm not really
a fashion person.

17:14.036 --> 17:15.112
You're wearing this.

17:15.288 --> 17:16.242
Come on, no.

17:16.417 --> 17:16.952
I'm serious.

17:17.127 --> 17:18.450
This color would be
amazing on you.

17:18.627 --> 17:22.333
And you're a size four, right?

17:22.505 --> 17:25.871
Well, aren't you sweet?

17:50.235 --> 17:51.363
Hey, guys, what's up?

17:51.536 --> 17:54.492
Ugh! Oh, my God!

17:56.458 --> 17:57.610
What are you wearing?!

17:57.788 --> 17:58.913
You're making me gay.

17:59.078 --> 18:03.250
It's a joke, obviously.
I'm wearing this as a joke!

18:03.418 --> 18:05.462
Bunch of comedy writers
don't know a joke, jeez.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.173
I just threw up in my mouth.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.462
I said it's a joke!

18:14.926 --> 18:18.182
Work it, Craig! Whoo!

18:19.686 --> 18:21.762
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.521
Excellent, right here.
Thank you.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.980
Oh, pizza!

18:25.146 --> 18:26.893
Thank you, sir.

18:27.066 --> 18:29.653
Hey, Liz, can we eat this out
on the roof gardens?

18:29.815 --> 18:31.063
I don't even know
how to get out there.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.230
I don't think people
are allowed out there.

18:32.406 --> 18:34.612
No, I see Today Show people
eating out there all the time.

18:34.788 --> 18:36.572
Really?
Even Ann Curry?

18:36.748 --> 18:43.831
I'll show you the studio in just a minute,
but first, this is where my writers write.

18:44.918 --> 18:46.540
Don't mind the odor.

18:46.717 --> 18:49.632
But seriously, since Tracy's arrival
the show is up in the key demos.

18:49.795 --> 18:54.760
We're driving male viewership,
and we're effectively synergizing backward overflow.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.760
Please, Liz,
let us eat outside.

18:57.938 --> 18:59.470
You know what?
I'll ask Jack.

18:59.647 --> 19:00.971
He'll let us eat out there,
right?

19:01.148 --> 19:05.140
He and I have
an important friendship.

19:05.317 --> 19:06.983
Hey, they didn't bring any sodas.

19:07.148 --> 19:10.231
I'll call Kenneth.

19:12.815 --> 19:16.492
S eriously,
where is Kenneth?

19:18.406 --> 19:22.283
Happy anniversary,
Mrs. Jordan.

19:22.455 --> 19:26.123
Excuse me, do y'all just have
noodles with butter?

19:26.298 --> 19:29.160
Hey, Jack!
Sorry to interrupt.

19:29.338 --> 19:31.420
Hey, can we eat
our pizza outside?

19:31.586 --> 19:33.462
'Cause those wangs from the Today Show
eat on the roof garden

19:33.638 --> 19:37.132
all the time, and, you know,
since I thought me and you are best buds--boink!

19:37.306 --> 19:40.760
Maybe you could do me a solid
and slip me the key to that thing.

19:40.936 --> 19:41.932
This guy's the best.

19:42.096 --> 19:44.140
He got me kick-ass
Chamillionaire tickets.

19:44.305 --> 19:45.471
You guys like Chamillionaire?

19:45.645 --> 19:49.853
Anyway, Jack rocks.
This guy, A-plus.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.062
Excuse me for a moment.

19:53.238 --> 19:55.520
I'm sorry for what's about to
happen right now.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.940
Just know that I don't mean it.

19:57.118 --> 19:58.110
Don't mean what?

19:58.287 --> 20:01.700
What group home did you escape from
that you would dare talk to me

20:01.867 --> 20:05.911
like some plumber's wife
in front of Ron Gordon and Bob Overmeyer?

20:06.087 --> 20:07.240
I don't even know
who those guys are.

20:07.417 --> 20:07.910
Oh, really?

20:08.088 --> 20:11.753
Your ignorance was obvious
when you waddled up to me
with your thin-lipped mouth

20:11.926 --> 20:14.842
full of greasy peasant food
and addressed me by my Christian name

20:15.005 --> 20:16.803
in front of the gentlemen
from Fairfield.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.630
That's Fairfield,
Connecticut, Lemon.

20:18.807 --> 20:19.671
GE Headquarters.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.933
But how would you know that
with your nigh-40 years of public education

20:23.096 --> 20:24.763
and daytime television viewing?

20:24.935 --> 20:27.683
If you ever pull a bush league
stunt like that again,

20:27.855 --> 20:29.680
I'm gonna have you writing
promos for Arena Football

20:29.858 --> 20:33.480
so fast it'll make
your inexplicably small head spin.

20:33.658 --> 20:36.190
Oh, snap.

20:39.616 --> 20:41.610
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:41.786 --> 20:43.200
I thought you said
we were friends.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.821
I said we were friendly.

20:44.995 --> 20:46.911
Well, I don't like you anymore.

20:47.087 --> 20:50.291
I don't believe you.

20:51.008 --> 20:54.253
Go easy on the pizza.
