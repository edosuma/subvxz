WEBVTT

00:39.500 --> 00:43.530
FRANCE, WORLD WAR II

00:47.890 --> 00:51.190
BRESSON MANSION, SUBURBAN PARIS

01:03.090 --> 01:05.019
I'm counting on you.

01:07.190 --> 01:08.410
For you

01:17.170 --> 01:18.380
Let's go.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.210
Here you are.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.880
Hand it over,

01:54.150 --> 01:55.320
Professor Bresson.

01:58.980 --> 02:02.200
I have nothing for you,

02:02.320 --> 02:03.830
You Nazi scum!

03:30.710 --> 03:32.530
Hey, are you ok?

03:51.900 --> 03:54.180
LUPIN III: THE FIRST

05:14.570 --> 05:18.420
YEARS LATER, IN PARIS

05:44.470 --> 05:46.130
Ladies and gentlemen!

05:46.420 --> 05:51.620
We have something special that
we are proud to present.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.380
A great and mysterious treasure made by the renowned
and distinguished Professor Bresson:

05:55.950 --> 05:57.900
The Bresson Diary!

06:03.900 --> 06:06.280
They say whoever is lucky enough to read it,

06:06.310 --> 06:09.200
will get their hands many treasures.

06:09.460 --> 06:11.550
Well, at least that's how the legend goes!

06:12.030 --> 06:14.940
I hear that even the Nazis
wanted this diary.

06:19.270 --> 06:20.280
Sir!

06:20.370 --> 06:23.720
A calling card! From Lupin III!

06:23.750 --> 06:25.170
What did you say?!

06:27.460 --> 06:30.590
"I am going to steal The Bresson Diary."

06:30.920 --> 06:32.720
"Lupin III."

06:34.380 --> 06:36.430
Put the diary in the vault for now!

06:47.820 --> 06:49.530
I take care of that.

06:49.650 --> 06:50.690
Wait!

06:51.740 --> 06:52.900
That face...

06:55.070 --> 06:58.280
Inspector Zenigata! I suspect this man is Lupin himself!

06:58.780 --> 07:00.510
Lupin!

07:00.540 --> 07:01.830
I got you!

07:02.500 --> 07:05.910
He came running in to deliver the warning,
but didn't even break a sweat!

07:06.520 --> 07:08.440
Hey, this chick's smart!

07:08.460 --> 07:09.670
I got you now!

07:15.350 --> 07:16.570
No you don't!

07:16.590 --> 07:18.140
Wait!

07:19.030 --> 07:21.160
You won't get away this time, Lupin!

07:26.050 --> 07:27.340
Open fire!

07:29.440 --> 07:31.520
Adieu and best wishes, ciao!

07:39.920 --> 07:41.320
Let's go!

07:42.390 --> 07:44.850
Curses! Damn it, Lupin!

07:45.160 --> 07:47.540
Inspector, the diary
needs to be moved to the vault!

07:48.010 --> 07:49.220
Take care of it!

07:49.420 --> 07:51.610
You! Escort her!

07:51.810 --> 07:53.760
Yes sir! This way.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.240
I...

08:05.810 --> 08:07.060
I'm sorry!

08:11.490 --> 08:14.390
A-are you a thief too?

08:16.610 --> 08:19.310
<i>Was anyone hurt?</i>
I'm so sorry!

08:45.620 --> 08:46.960
Oooh, I caught a big one!

08:47.140 --> 08:49.540
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'll be keeping this.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.620
Who'd have thought a pretty little thing like you was a thief too?

08:54.490 --> 08:56.050
Stop it! Are you stupid or something?

08:56.070 --> 08:57.600
Calm down, lady!

09:00.290 --> 09:03.130
You have no idea
how valuable this is!

09:05.240 --> 09:07.040
I know better than you.

09:23.070 --> 09:25.620
Don't be a thief if
you have no determination.

09:26.390 --> 09:27.430
See ya!

09:31.140 --> 09:32.830
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run!

09:32.940 --> 09:35.450
Jump!

09:38.300 --> 09:39.380
Perfect!

09:40.100 --> 09:42.190
Please give it back!

09:42.490 --> 09:44.280
I'm sorry, miss...

09:44.510 --> 09:46.750
but I am a REAL thief.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.830
So now this diary belongs to me.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.370
Thank you, Lupin!
Now it's mine!

09:57.390 --> 10:00.630
Fujiko, if you don't give that back right now,
there will be blood!

10:00.720 --> 10:02.240
Lupin!

10:02.370 --> 10:03.570
Pops?!

10:03.760 --> 10:06.360
Still falling for the same old trick?

10:06.580 --> 10:08.170
Get him!

10:16.140 --> 10:17.640
You idiots!

10:17.730 --> 10:19.180
He's right there!

10:19.360 --> 10:22.580
And arrest the other one too!

10:26.210 --> 10:27.420
Get off!

10:32.260 --> 10:33.370
What?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.380
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I failed.

10:44.390 --> 10:47.810
I'm not cut out for this kind of work!

10:47.840 --> 10:49.680
Useless girl.

10:49.980 --> 10:53.830
Forget it. The reinforcements
will take care of it from here.

10:54.090 --> 10:58.550
Our deal with you is over.

11:25.330 --> 11:26.760
Professor Lambert.

11:26.830 --> 11:27.840
Sir.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.960
Cheer up, my friends.

11:36.170 --> 11:39.170
I just received information

11:39.190 --> 11:42.290
that we will soon have The Bresson Diary
delivered right into our hands.

11:44.590 --> 11:45.630
However....

11:45.820 --> 11:52.070
as everyone knows, the lock on The Bresson Diary is considered unbreakable.

11:52.260 --> 11:56.930
We need to open it, no matter what.
It is essential that we break the code.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.070
She's here, sir.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.600
That woman has arrived.

12:05.010 --> 12:06.390
Mr. Geralt...

12:07.000 --> 12:08.280
Let's go.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.210
Here we are, as promised.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.380
Finally I have it in my hands...

12:19.440 --> 12:20.790
Indeed.

12:21.110 --> 12:23.520
It took quite a long time.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.570
I apologize, sir.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.280
So, about my payment...

12:28.460 --> 12:29.700
It's over there.

12:32.880 --> 12:37.370
See, this is the keyhole.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.020
These two parts
are interconnected.

12:40.540 --> 12:44.930
Mr. Geralt, it
matches my research.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.380
Wait.

12:49.570 --> 12:51.150
A tracker?

12:52.180 --> 12:56.180
Did you plan to get to the treasure
of The Bresson Diary first?

12:56.430 --> 12:58.650
- You thief!
Come on!

13:07.680 --> 13:08.960
Hey, pops...

13:10.470 --> 13:13.680
Arn't you a little old for this kind of thing?

13:15.490 --> 13:18.030
This time, you won't get away!

13:18.170 --> 13:23.510
The Bresson Diary is the only object that
Arsène Lupin was unable to steal.

13:23.710 --> 13:27.790
It only makes sense his grandson would want
to make up for his greatest failure.

13:29.050 --> 13:30.860
So this is how it ends....

13:31.640 --> 13:33.050
-but not today!

13:36.540 --> 13:38.580
They're here, they're here, they're here, they're here!

14:02.020 --> 14:04.130
Stop that car right now!

14:50.470 --> 14:52.090
Adios!

14:59.250 --> 15:02.750
Wait! Get back here! Lupin!

15:03.940 --> 15:05.160
How troublesome.

15:05.190 --> 15:06.850
What a drag.

15:06.870 --> 15:08.750
Stupid handcuffs...

15:08.770 --> 15:12.000
What took so long, Jigen? Goemon?

15:12.030 --> 15:14.700
A "thank you" would be nice, Lupin.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.530
It looks like you just
ran away from the circus.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.140
Ta-daaa!

15:20.510 --> 15:24.580
Now that we're together, let's
take back the Bresson diary!

15:24.610 --> 15:30.220
The diary talks about a
treasure that may or may not exist.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.270
You're alone on this one.

15:32.350 --> 15:35.650
Jigen, don't just leave me all alone like this.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.260
So that's it, then.

15:39.430 --> 15:44.350
I'll find the incredible, amazing treasure by myself then.
And I'm NOT gonna share it with you two.

16:02.110 --> 16:03.370
What?!

16:03.510 --> 16:04.810
What is it?

16:05.060 --> 16:07.170
This can not be. It's impossible.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.980
This was the key
to Bresson's diary.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.710
I want to know
what the problem is.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.210
Um..ah....

16:13.520 --> 16:15.790
You see, we're almost
there, Mr. Geralt.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.170
These excuses make me sick.

16:19.380 --> 16:20.880
Never repeat them again!

16:21.100 --> 16:22.430
You useless old man.

16:52.820 --> 16:55.730
A-are you a thief too?

16:58.550 --> 17:00.130
That's why I said,

17:00.160 --> 17:01.760
The thieving lifestyle doesn't suit you.

17:08.790 --> 17:10.079
You-

17:11.500 --> 17:12.960
Why are you here?

17:12.990 --> 17:14.010
Ouch!

17:14.390 --> 17:16.990
Take a look what was on your shoe.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.710
Wow, you must really like to read!

17:32.260 --> 17:33.530
What you want?

17:33.550 --> 17:35.900
Aren't we both after
the same treasure?

17:35.920 --> 17:38.380
Treasure? What you mean?

17:43.440 --> 17:47.450
You know about the "eclipse"? When the moon blots out the sun's light?

17:50.280 --> 17:52.180
Oh, so you do know what
I'm talking about!

18:03.000 --> 18:05.790
- Did you write this thesis?
- Stop that!

18:05.890 --> 18:08.750
Is it archeology? I knew it!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.890
It's your hobby, isn't it?

18:10.910 --> 18:13.730
That's right. But
I'm not like you.

18:13.820 --> 18:18.340
Archeology is the only way to discover
the truth about the past.

18:20.440 --> 18:24.270
See, this is how we listen
to the people of the past.

18:34.610 --> 18:38.120
Damn, it's some feat to
have gathered all this priceless material.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.970
Well, just look at that.
It must be the twin of this one.

18:47.470 --> 18:49.180
Why do you have that?

18:50.250 --> 18:52.150
I inherited it
from my grandfather.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.990
So you stole it?

18:54.020 --> 18:55.780
Why do you assume that?!

18:55.970 --> 18:58.280
Listen, tell me something.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.270
Where did you see that key?

19:00.300 --> 19:01.810
Calm down a little.

19:02.190 --> 19:05.530
At least let me change clothes first!

19:05.870 --> 19:06.910
Okay?

19:08.220 --> 19:09.450
Don't peek!

19:20.890 --> 19:23.610
Hello, grandpa?

19:24.020 --> 19:26.520
Lupin is here. He
came to my apartment.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.100
He has the same key as us.

19:29.220 --> 19:32.300
I think..... there are two keys.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.920
That explains everything.

19:35.580 --> 19:39.070
I'll give you another
chance, Laetitia.

19:40.160 --> 19:44.670
I want you to bring Lupin to me,
along with the other key.

19:44.700 --> 19:48.080
But I... I don't want
to work with that... thief.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.230
Is that so?

19:49.960 --> 19:52.740
If you can manage...

19:53.310 --> 19:56.920
I will reconsider the
small agreement that we made.

19:57.980 --> 20:00.130
BOSTON UNIVERSITY OF ARCHEOLOGY

20:03.780 --> 20:05.180
Let's make a deal.

20:06.010 --> 20:08.550
I give you all the
information I have;

20:08.580 --> 20:13.200
In return, you help me to
solve the mystery of The Bresson Diary.

20:13.490 --> 20:16.850
And why would I want to work with
such a pathetic thief?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.220
No deal.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.570
You might not like it, but
I have all the information stored right here

20:23.730 --> 20:28.070
There are many ways to extract
information, you know that, right?

20:29.450 --> 20:32.110
You're not that
kind of guy, are you?

20:32.170 --> 20:34.180
But, you are the greatest
thief in the world.

20:37.020 --> 20:38.860
So, let's work together.

20:39.250 --> 20:40.630
Just like Bresson!

20:41.820 --> 20:43.140
What do you mean, just like Bresson?

20:43.500 --> 20:46.980
They say he had a
partner who funded the research.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.760
You mean Adolf Hitler?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.360
Don't talk nonsense!

20:50.470 --> 20:55.460
Bresson lost his life so The
Eclipse would not fall in the hands of the Nazis!

20:55.480 --> 20:57.860
My bad. I understood.

21:00.350 --> 21:04.270
But he also left behind a trail.

21:06.550 --> 21:08.730
Here in Bresson's diary.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.730
Don't you want to know why?

21:13.220 --> 21:14.510
I want to know.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.550
I want to solve the
mystery of The Eclipse!

21:19.060 --> 21:20.460
Such beauty.

21:21.750 --> 21:24.020
You're hired, at minimum wage though.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.440
Really?

21:25.820 --> 21:27.730
Jigen and the guys ditched me.

21:28.450 --> 21:32.290
I think it will be just
you and me. Ladies first.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.570
You can count on me!

21:35.080 --> 21:36.540
By the way...

21:37.080 --> 21:38.140
Laetitia.

21:38.450 --> 21:41.430
In case you wanted to know
my name. It's Laetitia.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.160
Laetitia?

22:02.420 --> 22:06.240
Are you sure we didn't take a
wrong turn?

22:07.500 --> 22:09.430
He has no address...

22:10.020 --> 22:14.600
but I know that this cargo ship
comes into contact with him every week.

22:14.990 --> 22:16.910
I still don't trust you.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.990
After all, Laetitia is
a false name, right?

22:19.370 --> 22:21.560
And yours? Is that fake too?

22:21.760 --> 22:23.260
If it isn't, can you
explain this to me?

22:23.830 --> 22:26.430
LAETITIA,
ANNIVERSARY OF MARRIAGE

22:32.660 --> 22:34.760
It's your mom, correct?

22:35.260 --> 22:37.960
Laetitia is her name.

22:38.850 --> 22:42.250
Yes. But I'm also
named Laetitia.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.740
It is customary to give the name "Laetitia"
to all the girls in the family.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.800
Your an even worse liar than a thief.

22:53.350 --> 22:54.390
Anyway...

22:54.640 --> 22:59.470
My parents died in a car accident
when I was young.

23:01.010 --> 23:03.210
At least, that's what I
deduced from the photos.

23:14.690 --> 23:17.600
What are we waiting for?

23:52.870 --> 23:56.080
I told you: He doesn't have
a fixed address.

24:04.310 --> 24:09.520
We are about to unlock
The Bresson Diary.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.330
All that's left now
is to find the other key.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.720
So this is where it's being kept?

24:24.690 --> 24:27.210
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.240
It must be easy for you, right?

24:32.330 --> 24:35.690
After all, you are the
famous thief, Lupin III.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.530
But of course!

24:50.690 --> 24:53.490
- Piece of cake!
- Amazing.

24:55.380 --> 24:59.740
Finally. The dream even ol' gramps
couldn't fulfill...

25:01.160 --> 25:02.280
What's it?

25:02.650 --> 25:05.020
I dunno, I just have
a strange feeling...

25:05.520 --> 25:07.540
Like I've touched
this before.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.250
Lupin, quickly, let's get out of here.

25:15.770 --> 25:18.980
It'll be difficult to get away
with all this increased security.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.410
We have no choice. Let's
open it right here.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.840
I thought it might form a key...

25:44.870 --> 25:47.830
bycombining the two pieces.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.100
Is that how you use it?

25:50.170 --> 25:53.060
It won't open with just the key.

25:53.090 --> 25:54.540
You need a password.

25:54.570 --> 25:55.790
A password?

25:55.970 --> 25:58.310
Do you see the inscription here??

25:58.670 --> 26:01.970
The mechanism activates with the key
and opens with the correct sequence.

26:02.390 --> 26:03.850
Look here,

26:04.150 --> 26:07.120
Arming the mechanism
will activate a bomb.

26:07.140 --> 26:09.660
The diary and whoever
wants to unlock it.....

26:09.680 --> 26:11.600
will be, well, blown to bits.

26:13.210 --> 26:16.830
Bresson really wanted
to keep it a secret.

26:17.510 --> 26:20.110
But if he did want someone to open it...

26:20.400 --> 26:23.150
It would be a genius at unraveling codes,

26:23.240 --> 26:25.590
A cryptanalysis specialist,

26:25.640 --> 26:28.640
Someone who loves treasures
more than anything.

26:28.660 --> 26:30.730
Are you seriously talking about yourself...?

26:31.730 --> 26:34.080
Now, how are we going to
rearrange the letters

26:34.110 --> 26:36.650
to create the password
that opens this thing?

26:37.970 --> 26:40.310
We have five letters.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.730
Here it indicates that
the word has eight letters.

26:42.790 --> 26:43.900
I understand.

26:44.180 --> 26:47.070
We just need to find
out what the password is.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.560
Eh..woah!

26:57.710 --> 26:59.540
What happened??

26:59.570 --> 27:01.030
You started the timer.

27:01.130 --> 27:04.540
We have less than
a minute until we explode!

27:06.960 --> 27:10.340
You should have said that that could happen from the beginning!

27:10.850 --> 27:11.890
We're done for!

27:11.910 --> 27:13.500
Calm down, woman!

27:20.390 --> 27:23.150
A, E, I, I, T... An
eight letter word.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.360
Wait, did I think of something?!

27:24.380 --> 27:26.560
What is it? What's the word?!

27:27.840 --> 27:29.610
A word that has
to do with Bresson himself!

27:34.790 --> 27:36.580
It can not be....

27:37.310 --> 27:40.690
Wait... Is it possible?

27:40.710 --> 27:41.920
Have you figured it out?

27:41.950 --> 27:44.190
There's no other choice
It can only be this.

27:44.210 --> 27:46.550
What if you're wrong?!
You need to be sure!

27:46.570 --> 27:48.050
Or we will explode!

27:48.070 --> 27:50.080
Well, we'll explode if
we don't do anything also.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.610
Come on.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.440
Amazing!

28:33.560 --> 28:34.950
So I was right.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.370
Amazing! That was fantastic!

28:37.400 --> 28:39.050
How did you figure it out?

28:39.080 --> 28:41.000
It's going to take
too long to explain.

28:41.390 --> 28:43.910
Now, let's take a peek inside
this diary of ours.

28:47.420 --> 28:51.150
"The Eclipse is a gift
from an ancient civilization."

28:51.920 --> 28:54.920
Wow, you really know
how to read that?

28:54.950 --> 28:56.600
It is ancient Hebrew.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.800
It's obvious: Since he used
ancient languages,

28:59.820 --> 29:03.090
Bresson wanted an archaeologist
to read this diary.

29:03.940 --> 29:05.240
Now it's in the Scythian language!

29:06.010 --> 29:09.670
"If one is not able to handle such brilliance...

29:09.980 --> 29:12.070
"...then leave it alone."

29:12.370 --> 29:13.530
A gift...

29:16.630 --> 29:20.420
The eclipse was an infinite energy generator!

29:21.080 --> 29:23.810
"Coudée". This is
French. It means cubit.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.060
One cubit is 444 millimeters.

29:26.090 --> 29:28.360
If you multiply,
the result is 39,960.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.940
- Forty kilometers.
- And the "City of the Gods?"

29:30.970 --> 29:34.470
Can't you deduce that, just seeing this
drawing? It's Teotihuacan, in Mexico!

29:34.490 --> 29:36.400
You're amazing!

29:37.060 --> 29:40.600
Didn't I tell you already?
This is my field of study.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.760
Now it is written in Akkadian.

29:45.980 --> 29:48.270
"To reach the eclipse..."

29:48.460 --> 29:50.160
I think there are three trials!

29:50.210 --> 29:53.410
Here it shows how
to pass them, but...

29:53.440 --> 29:55.890
I get it. This is an instruction manual.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.010
Eh?

30:03.180 --> 30:05.370
What are you doing, Laetitia?

30:07.070 --> 30:08.670
I'm sorry, Lupin.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.670
Isn't it a bit early to apologize?

30:12.270 --> 30:13.590
And anyway, you forgot your bullets.

30:17.730 --> 30:21.030
You can't be a great thief if
you don't have your head in the game.

30:21.730 --> 30:24.030
Why don't you all stop hiding
and come in already?

30:24.310 --> 30:25.580
Or should I come outside with my hands up?

30:31.490 --> 30:34.850
You knew we were
waiting, Lupin III.

30:34.930 --> 30:37.960
It was the only way in or out.

30:37.980 --> 30:40.870
What are you going to do now?

30:41.060 --> 30:44.840
The situation puts
you at a disadvantage.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.290
The only option is to surrender.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.700
- Hans!
- Yes sir!

30:54.910 --> 30:58.200
Here's what you
wanted, Grandpa Lambert.

31:00.090 --> 31:03.210
So is he your grandfather, hmm?

31:04.100 --> 31:05.810
Good job, Laetitia.

31:06.100 --> 31:09.400
Will you be able to
solve the rest yourself?

31:09.590 --> 31:12.720
Doubt it! You were so inept you needed
me to do the job for you!

31:12.940 --> 31:19.630
Don't be so arrogant just
because you're good at puzzles, Lupin!

31:19.660 --> 31:22.760
My skill unlocked the diary
that you couldn't open!

31:22.790 --> 31:23.970
Shut it!

31:24.000 --> 31:26.970
I was chosen as a founding member

31:27.000 --> 31:30.420
from an incredibly distinguished
research institute!

31:30.440 --> 31:33.810
Take it easy! Now you're
the one bragging!

31:33.840 --> 31:38.090
And what's it called? Whats the
name of this famous institute!

31:41.860 --> 31:44.050
It's Ahnenerbe, isn't it?

31:44.480 --> 31:45.880
Ahnenerbe?

31:46.370 --> 31:49.030
What are you planning
with the Eclipse?

31:49.060 --> 31:51.380
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!!

31:51.400 --> 31:53.880
You are no longer of use to us!

31:53.930 --> 31:55.060
Hans!

31:55.220 --> 31:57.350
Take this cheeky bastard away!

31:57.370 --> 31:58.430
Yes sir!

32:18.880 --> 32:20.690
What are you going
to do with Lupin?

32:22.520 --> 32:26.020
Don't tell me you got
attached, my granddaughter.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.880
Of course not.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.090
He's just a petty thief.

32:36.790 --> 32:39.590
So... I wanted to talk to you.

32:43.740 --> 32:45.070
What you want?

32:45.960 --> 32:48.270
I did what you asked, didn't I?

32:49.670 --> 32:53.810
I don't need to do anything
like this anymore, right?

32:54.490 --> 32:58.250
Will you follow through
with our agreement?

33:00.150 --> 33:02.560
Boston University, is that it?

33:03.420 --> 33:07.000
The archeology department there
is one of the best in the world.

33:07.020 --> 33:10.390
- Do you think you can keep up?
- I really want to try to go there!

33:10.890 --> 33:15.120
In fact...they already
accepted my application.

33:16.610 --> 33:19.820
Don't speak nonsense! How
dare you do this to me?

33:20.040 --> 33:21.370
You forgot...

33:21.410 --> 33:23.660
Who took you from
that shithole orphanage

33:23.840 --> 33:26.200
and turned you into what you are today?!

33:26.230 --> 33:28.570
- You are ungrateful!
- I'm so sorry!

33:29.390 --> 33:33.330
I can't thank you enough for everything
you did for me!

33:33.700 --> 33:38.450
But, I don't want to
steal and cheat people anymore!

33:39.440 --> 33:42.350
I really just want to
study archeology.

33:42.830 --> 33:45.980
I want to become an
archaeologist, like Bresson!

33:53.530 --> 33:57.640
Granddaughter, when did you
grow up so much?

33:59.360 --> 34:03.780
When this is over, you can go
to Boston university, or wherever you want.

34:05.580 --> 34:07.070
Really, you mean it?!

34:08.520 --> 34:10.310
Thank you, grandpa!

34:13.139 --> 34:14.949
I did it!

34:20.770 --> 34:24.520
You fear that girl's
talent, don't you?

34:24.719 --> 34:26.330
What's that you're holding?

34:27.630 --> 34:30.560
That famous thesis of yours,

34:30.670 --> 34:33.969
seems to be plagiarism of something
she wrote in kindergarten.

34:35.170 --> 34:38.489
After all, talent is
hereditary, isn't it?

34:40.070 --> 34:44.409
Shouldn't you thank
her, professor?

34:51.310 --> 34:52.830
How dare you...

34:53.310 --> 34:56.100
Everyone is trying to
humiliate me, is that it?!

35:20.700 --> 35:22.510
Look, if it's not Fujiko-chan!

35:23.100 --> 35:25.000
I didn't think I
would see you here!

35:25.130 --> 35:26.100
Lupin!

35:26.320 --> 35:29.140
It looks like karma finally got to
you for cheating on me.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.480
Shut up!

35:30.600 --> 35:33.350
No small talk! Behave yourselves.

35:35.540 --> 35:38.300
Has anyone ever told
you how handsome you are?

35:38.680 --> 35:41.210
Can a gal get a
closer look?

35:46.840 --> 35:50.230
And has anyone ever told
you how cute you are?

35:55.160 --> 35:56.660
This was good!

35:57.250 --> 36:00.650
Now that you're here, Lupin, this place
is gonna get a lot more interesting.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.580
Don't just leave me here!

36:12.230 --> 36:13.140
Here!

36:15.330 --> 36:16.830
Hang in there!

36:20.660 --> 36:23.780
Couldn't you have landed closer?!

36:40.850 --> 36:41.800
There she is!

36:50.450 --> 36:52.750
Thanks for the ride!

37:03.600 --> 37:06.090
What are we going
to say to Mr. Geralt-

37:06.820 --> 37:09.110
Sleeping on the job, I see?

37:10.930 --> 37:12.590
Take a look at this.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.940
It is exactly as I predicted.

37:15.810 --> 37:18.680
The Eclipse is a weapon
of incredible destructive power.

37:18.890 --> 37:22.270
It even describes how to use it.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.270
Very well, Lambert.

37:31.470 --> 37:36.920
I know he will be extremely pleased when
he gets his hands on The Eclipse.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.170
"He"?

37:39.560 --> 37:44.730
It is true? Is the Führer... alive?

37:45.240 --> 37:48.250
You may have heard mumblings
that the Führer

37:48.550 --> 37:52.560
fled to South America
the day Berlin collapsed.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.360
It's true! He is alive.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.690
This photo is
undeniable proof.

38:00.370 --> 38:01.860
It's incredible!

38:01.980 --> 38:05.790
This was taken
in Brazil two months ago.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.130
The Führer and the Eclipse!

38:08.490 --> 38:13.360
Perhaps we can even
revive the third reich!

38:13.580 --> 38:17.270
You old fool, rebirth
is more than certain!

38:28.780 --> 38:30.970
- Laetitia!
- What did you hear?!

38:32.390 --> 38:34.010
Tell us everything you heard!

38:35.340 --> 38:36.850
...Is what you're saying true?

38:38.010 --> 38:42.730
You were meaning to use
the Eclipse as a weapon?

38:44.700 --> 38:48.130
"If one is not able to handle such brilliance...

38:48.310 --> 38:50.030
"...then leave it alone."

38:50.900 --> 38:53.040
"The method for braking
is described here."

38:54.930 --> 38:56.170
Ahnenerbe.

38:59.050 --> 39:02.300
I investigated and discovered that
it was a Nazi research institute.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.210
It was part of the SS.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.060
What are you doing
with that gun?!

39:15.700 --> 39:16.910
What are you-?

39:17.030 --> 39:19.130
End her with your own hands.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.290
That naïve
sense of justice...

39:21.820 --> 39:24.040
You raised that girl wrong!

39:24.700 --> 39:27.700
She'll ruin everything!

39:28.200 --> 39:29.230
Understand?

39:31.650 --> 39:35.640
If your loyalty to the Führer
is real, you will do it.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.390
Or can you not do it, Lambert?!

39:40.190 --> 39:43.260
Th-the girl can still
be useful!

39:43.380 --> 39:46.430
You've lost your guts. Now your
nothing but another pathetic old man.

39:47.410 --> 39:48.520
W-wait!

39:50.850 --> 39:52.140
You idiot!

40:01.930 --> 40:06.820
Remember? this is how we listen
to the people of the past.

40:12.940 --> 40:14.230
I'm falling?

40:15.250 --> 40:16.150
EH?!

40:18.040 --> 40:19.770
Am I really falling?!

40:19.900 --> 40:24.170
Parachute! Parachute, parachute, parachute, PARACHUUUTE!!

40:24.300 --> 40:27.650
Hello, madame! What a
coincidence to see you here.

40:27.780 --> 40:28.680
Lupin!

40:28.800 --> 40:32.970
It seems we both jumped off
the plane without thinking.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.810
Why would you do that?! You're crazy!

40:36.140 --> 40:39.230
Hold on, Lupin, save me!

40:41.420 --> 40:42.630
Lupin!

40:57.340 --> 41:00.300
I can always count
on you, Fujiko!

41:00.420 --> 41:02.880
This is going to be
expensive for you, Lupin.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.540
Maybe I pay with
my body?

41:05.830 --> 41:07.310
Don't even try...

41:09.760 --> 41:11.840
That's no reason to get so rough!

41:19.280 --> 41:20.800
Persistent bastards!

41:29.620 --> 41:32.340
Hold on tight,
I'll lose them!

41:32.730 --> 41:34.650
Maybe a bit slower?!

41:42.900 --> 41:43.900
Laetitia!

41:47.200 --> 41:48.790
You did it!

42:05.900 --> 42:07.710
Down here, jump!

42:10.900 --> 42:13.060
- Thanks!
- It's no trouble.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.440
What?

42:19.260 --> 42:20.220
Here I come!

42:23.670 --> 42:26.000
Jigen, you bastard!

42:26.130 --> 42:29.180
Can't you see that I've got
my hands full!?

42:37.350 --> 42:38.620
They're coming back!

42:42.750 --> 42:44.250
Wahhh!

42:54.300 --> 42:55.780
That was close.

42:55.970 --> 42:59.290
You don't say.
In fact, why are you here anyways?

43:01.310 --> 43:04.710
Fujiko told us that
you opened the Bresson Diary.

43:04.830 --> 43:07.690
And that you would've kept it all to yourself!

43:10.880 --> 43:13.840
You guys only show up when there's
money involved!

43:15.030 --> 43:17.750
What do we do? They'll
activate the Eclipse!

43:18.120 --> 43:21.400
- Lupin!
- Don't worry, I'll think of something.

43:34.110 --> 43:36.720
...I don't think I have any
choice but to ask him.

43:36.920 --> 43:39.090
What's your plan, Lupin?

43:39.240 --> 43:42.230
Well, there's a guy who'll come after
me anywhere in the world.

43:51.610 --> 43:53.090
Helloooo?

43:55.260 --> 43:56.870
Lupin!

43:57.130 --> 44:00.290
Finally decided
to give up, I see!?

44:01.850 --> 44:05.470
How nice of you to tell me
your exact location!

44:05.590 --> 44:08.320
The games up Lupin, stay were you
are and don't resist!

44:20.740 --> 44:22.510
Hold on a second, that's not..

44:23.050 --> 44:24.410
LUPIN!

44:24.530 --> 44:26.650
He noticed already!?

44:26.840 --> 44:28.340
Lupin!!

44:28.960 --> 44:31.110
Come back here, Lupin!

44:33.510 --> 44:36.090
Thanks for the ride, Pops!

44:37.230 --> 44:38.160
Inspector!

44:38.820 --> 44:39.960
Jump!

44:46.950 --> 44:48.940
Lupin!

44:49.940 --> 44:52.020
Good try, Pops!

44:52.150 --> 44:54.200
How do you like that!?

45:02.840 --> 45:04.910
I know it's a little hard to believe.

45:05.040 --> 45:10.310
No, Interpol has been concerned with
Ahnenerbe's movements for years.

45:10.690 --> 45:15.380
We even created a special task force
to fight the resurgence of the Nazis.

45:16.100 --> 45:19.630
So it's not hard to
believe what you've said.

45:19.750 --> 45:22.060
Well, these guys are about to get

45:22.180 --> 45:24.260
a weapon
of mass destruction.

45:24.450 --> 45:26.460
So let's make a truce.
How about it?

45:36.490 --> 45:38.970
C'mon, it smells so good!

45:40.060 --> 45:42.280
I will never work with you!

45:42.410 --> 45:43.530
Please?

45:44.370 --> 45:45.670
Trust us.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.750
I will cooperate,
whatever the cost!

45:54.320 --> 45:55.350
Is this real?

46:00.270 --> 46:03.080
An oil platform, off the Atlantic coast

46:04.680 --> 46:06.750
Finish refueling
as soon as possible!

46:06.890 --> 46:07.860
Yes, sir!

46:09.340 --> 46:10.960
Penny for your thoughts?

46:18.280 --> 46:21.800
I helped Ahnenerbe
without knowing it.

46:22.890 --> 46:24.210
I even became a thief.

46:26.350 --> 46:29.290
Why did my grandfather do this?

46:29.510 --> 46:33.270
For starters, he's not really
your grandfather.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.720
Cut that out.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.400
What lie have
you woven now?

46:40.480 --> 46:43.530
You were adopted by Lambert
when you were a child.

46:43.730 --> 46:44.930
Do you know why?

46:45.210 --> 46:48.290
Because he was my only relative.

46:48.750 --> 46:51.470
No, you were the legitimate
heir to the key,

46:51.780 --> 46:54.400
and there was a possibility
of you knowing the password.

46:57.540 --> 47:01.360
Lambert took you
out of the orphanage,

47:01.530 --> 47:04.780
and raised you to be a pushover
that steals from others.

47:06.910 --> 47:10.380
This is absurd. What
are you even talking about?

47:12.770 --> 47:14.350
In fact, it was your name.

47:14.550 --> 47:14.950
Eh?

47:15.450 --> 47:17.950
L-A-E-T-I-T-I-A.

47:18.240 --> 47:20.540
Eight letters. Five
different letters.

47:21.410 --> 47:22.910
Laetitia.

47:24.180 --> 47:26.470
The password I
used was your name.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.250
You understand what
that means, right?

47:32.130 --> 47:35.400
Your real grandfather,
was Bresson.

47:41.220 --> 47:42.540
It's quite a shock, I know.

47:43.610 --> 47:48.660
But that explains why your
name is the password.

47:49.250 --> 47:52.530
The Bresson Diary was unlocked
with your name.

47:54.600 --> 47:55.510
But...

47:55.630 --> 47:59.740
And his, and your passion for
archeology is proof.

48:00.030 --> 48:02.370
You can't help yourself
even if you try.

48:02.890 --> 48:04.690
It only increases, doesn't it?

48:06.860 --> 48:10.210
I'm the same way.
It's in my blood.

48:13.220 --> 48:18.040
See, this is how we listen
to the people of the past.

48:23.410 --> 48:24.610
Is it true?

48:26.130 --> 48:29.880
Can I really believe you?

48:30.010 --> 48:32.200
I swear on my life.

48:33.360 --> 48:35.140
I took this when we ran away.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.440
It was yours from the start.

48:49.310 --> 48:53.920
I can't... I can't believe it.

49:01.620 --> 49:04.730
If it's really true, then
I did something terrible!

49:04.910 --> 49:09.730
Because of my stupidity, The Bresson Diary
is in the hands of thieves!

49:13.670 --> 49:18.490
I mean, that's technically correct.

49:20.190 --> 49:23.010
We will reach
Teotihuacan in roughly two hours.

49:24.100 --> 49:25.960
That damn thief!

49:33.390 --> 49:35.200
The game isn't over yet.

49:41.270 --> 49:47.470
But why Professor Bresson...
I mean, why, my real grandfather...

49:47.600 --> 49:50.390
Why didn't he destroy the
eclipse when he had the chance?

49:52.310 --> 49:55.240
I think he wanted to believe
that humans

49:55.370 --> 49:57.560
would be able to do
that themselves one day.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.530
He must have been a
very romantic man!

50:01.550 --> 50:06.490
Well, you have to be a romantic to become an archeologist, Lupin.

50:08.020 --> 50:09.240
And a thief.

50:17.850 --> 50:20.180
I dunno, I just have
a strange feeling...

50:20.640 --> 50:22.680
It feels like I've
touched this before..

50:25.460 --> 50:27.550
My body even knew it
from the beginning.

50:28.830 --> 50:29.820
Knew what?

50:31.270 --> 50:35.260
He just lied that he hadn't
stolen the diary!

50:35.640 --> 50:40.590
Lupin I designed this lock!

50:42.720 --> 50:47.300
See that Lupin flower? It's
they symbol of my family, Lupin.

50:48.020 --> 50:51.220
So that means that
Professor Bresson's partner...

50:53.400 --> 50:56.620
Lupin! Laetitia! We're ready to go!

50:59.190 --> 51:02.880
The fact that we ran into each other
could be part of our grandfathers' plan!

51:03.000 --> 51:05.380
Let's go make them proud!

51:15.120 --> 51:18.930
FORTY KILOMETERS NORTH
TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO

51:30.920 --> 51:37.060
Look at that symbol! There's no
doubt, these are the ruins of The Eclipse!

52:09.830 --> 52:13.230
Hans, you go first.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.850
Did you come all the way
here just to be afraid?

52:28.770 --> 52:30.990
Help! Help me!

52:41.150 --> 52:45.760
It looks like you can't
get through without the Bresson Diary.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.820
What do you intend
to do, Lambert?

52:51.020 --> 52:54.610
The diary was unlocked, only
to be stolen by a petty thief.

52:54.930 --> 52:56.850
It's so embarrassing!

52:57.660 --> 53:01.540
Mr. Geralt, the Eclipse is
within our reach, we can't just give up like this!

53:01.670 --> 53:03.170
But you saw what happened!

53:03.670 --> 53:08.900
Or are you blind? Do you really
think we can do it without the diary?

53:10.090 --> 53:12.180
What would you have us do then?!

53:15.060 --> 53:16.080
What are they doing?

53:16.570 --> 53:19.070
Looks like some in fighting.

53:19.490 --> 53:22.720
They're planning to
return to the crash site

53:22.850 --> 53:24.750
in order to try
and find the Diary.

53:25.460 --> 53:27.150
So it'll be a while
before they get back here.

53:28.470 --> 53:29.980
I can't wait.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.650
It's fantastic!

53:39.430 --> 53:41.260
These are the ruins
of The Eclipse.

53:45.740 --> 53:48.750
And this is what'll happen to us
if we enter. Encouraging.

53:54.130 --> 53:55.550
The first trial...

53:56.020 --> 54:00.610
It's mentioned how to pass this, in the
language in which the text is written.

54:00.730 --> 54:02.160
And what language is that?

54:02.280 --> 54:06.360
Akkadian. The Hammurabi Code is famous
for being written in Akkadian...

54:06.570 --> 54:08.880
Is it the one that says
"an eye for an eye?"

54:12.530 --> 54:13.910
What is it, Goemon?

54:14.910 --> 54:16.410
The eyes.

54:21.620 --> 54:23.930
An eyeball is missing!

54:27.440 --> 54:32.680
One of these globes should do.

54:33.700 --> 54:35.950
You gotta be kidding me.

54:36.640 --> 54:39.180
Well, let me know when you find it.

54:41.140 --> 54:42.660
Wha-wha-wha-what's going on?!

54:44.930 --> 54:46.440
What's this?

54:50.110 --> 54:54.350
Apparently, the creators of The Eclipse
figured out how to manipulate gravity.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.860
This isn't the right one...

54:58.280 --> 54:59.590
Any progress?

55:00.680 --> 55:01.870
Nope, unfortunately.

55:16.860 --> 55:17.980
Oi, Lupin!

55:32.720 --> 55:34.050
Amazing.

55:54.210 --> 55:56.500
Look, I'm Superman!

56:04.280 --> 56:05.290
How's that?

56:10.410 --> 56:12.090
I think it's stopped.

56:20.060 --> 56:21.820
I'm sure this can sell for
a pretty sum.

56:43.220 --> 56:44.230
What's written next?

56:44.350 --> 56:46.790
"The fifth king of
the first Uruk dynasty

56:46.910 --> 56:49.670
had a dream before your
friend's arrival."

56:49.790 --> 56:52.730
What is this talk
about Uruk dynasty?

56:53.170 --> 56:56.760
Is easy. It has to
do with King Gilgamesh.

56:56.890 --> 56:58.730
But didn't he dream of his friend?

56:58.860 --> 56:59.760
So?

57:00.150 --> 57:02.290
Dream about stars
falling on you.

57:02.500 --> 57:06.000
Stars falling on you?

57:06.380 --> 57:07.970
What does that mean?

57:15.240 --> 57:16.260
Mr. Jigen!

57:21.570 --> 57:24.770
The stars that fall on us.

57:25.470 --> 57:28.410
A meteorite? That should be it!

57:29.110 --> 57:31.010
Lupin, hand over
your meteorite.

57:31.140 --> 57:32.610
Of course, miss. Here you go...

57:32.930 --> 57:35.310
As if I just walk around
with one!

57:36.190 --> 57:39.390
What? You always have
things in your pockets.

57:39.540 --> 57:41.540
So there's nothing we can do.

57:41.910 --> 57:44.980
Goemon! What is it?

57:45.540 --> 57:46.800
Leave me alone!

57:47.040 --> 57:53.400
I've got it! Your Zantetsuken...
must be a Ryusei-Ken.

57:54.300 --> 57:56.030
What are you talking
about, Pops?

57:56.950 --> 57:58.390
A Ryusei-Ken,

57:58.660 --> 58:02.470
is a blade forged
from meteorite-derived iron.

58:03.270 --> 58:04.690
Is that true, Goemon?

58:04.820 --> 58:07.890
I do not know! Even if
it's true, I refuse.

58:08.070 --> 58:10.010
Please, Goemon!

58:13.530 --> 58:15.740
I will not lend my blade!

58:16.040 --> 58:18.900
What if Zantetsuken is ruined?!

58:19.290 --> 58:23.690
Goemon! Stop pouting
and look behind you.

58:33.190 --> 58:34.100
How about that?

58:40.750 --> 58:41.900
Thanks.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.420
Goemon! Let's go!

58:44.710 --> 58:46.580
I will stay here.

58:46.720 --> 58:48.610
What do you mean? Hurry up.

58:54.980 --> 58:57.900
I do not like using
Zantetsuken for such an unworthy task...

58:58.780 --> 59:02.760
Farewell for now. I'll
return to reclaim you later.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.890
- That can't be right!
- What does it say?

59:13.010 --> 59:14.360
"The final judgment..."

59:15.440 --> 59:16.820
It's... death row.

59:18.800 --> 59:21.830
"Use someone's
physical skills to overcome it."

59:22.320 --> 59:24.310
Lupin can do that, can't he?

59:24.510 --> 59:27.450
If you can run to
the cathedral entrance...

59:28.220 --> 59:31.850
it seems that all the
other trials will deactivate.

59:33.240 --> 59:35.220
It's not much of a choice...

59:39.690 --> 59:40.980
See ya soon!

59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.800
Okay, now this time, it's for real!

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:04.920
Lupin, is that...

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.600
Is it my grandfather's hat?

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.190
Ey', that's mine!

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.720
Time to do this!

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.710
Amazing...

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.290
Grandfather.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.830
Grandfather, I did it.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.960
Impressive.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:53.010
You are very
talented indeed.

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.990
You came back here a little fast, didn't
you? Forget something?

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:02.530
Only a few
of the boys left.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.640
However,

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:09.050
I think we managed to trick you and
your little group of thieves.

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:14.110
Our bad, you got us.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.140
What a pain in the ass...

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.160
You have some guts to treat an
Interpol officer like this.

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:27.880
You'll regret it!

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:33.430
Lupin, I'm assuming that machine there that
is the treasure of the Eclipse?

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.670
I assume so.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.960
Where's the gold,
silver and diamonds?!

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.730
That isn't what
you promised me at all!

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.690
If I had Zantetsuken,

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.260
we wouldn't be here,
humiliated by these scum.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:18.170
This is a gift from an
ancient civilization to the Führer!

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:27.490
I've finally done it.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:30.750
I have the Eclipse in my grasp!

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:35.590
Now, Laetitia: give me
The Bresson Diary.

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.760
What are you waiting for?

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.770
I won't work for you!

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:50.900
I only work for Professor
Bresson, my real grandfather.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:55.600
Well, then. It looks like
you've found out everything.

01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:59.710
Alas, it is too late.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.940
What do you think
will happen if they know...

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.730
who stole the diary?

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.920
- You forced me to!
- But you're still the thief here.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.760
I've kept all the evidence.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.820
The press will love this news:

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.630
"Granddaughter of the renowned professor
Bresson conspired with the thief Lupin III,

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.290
"and is arrested for
stealing the Bresson Diary!"

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.670
Imagine that!

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:35.860
- Stop it!
- Give up!

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:40.250
You will never be a successful
archaeologist like Bresson was!

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.280
You will do what I say for
the rest of your life!

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.980
And you will never be in
the spotlight!

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.770
That belongs to me!

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.870
The Eclipse has been reborn!

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.190
Get up.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.010
Don't leave us here!

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.680
Those idiots!

01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:20.690
They'll pay for this!

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.940
Zantetsuken! Zantetsuken! Zantetsuken!

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:40.690
Sit down.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:47.770
Damn!

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.070
You ready to get saved?!

01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:59.050
Lupin! Guys!

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:27.390
This will be a worthy
task for Zantetsuken!

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.609
Get us out of here, Fujiko!
They're gonna activate the Eclipse!

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:20.370
On it!

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:51.680
Now, behold the power
of the Eclipse!

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.479
Gaze upon it's glory!

01:08:57.990 --> 01:09:01.910
Lupin and his gang
will cease to exist.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.930
Don't do it!
Leave them alone!

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:07.160
Stop!

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:04.300
No!

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:19.780
What the hell?!

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.360
Lupin, what is this crazy crap!?

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.640
Whatever it is,
it's incredibly powerful.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:44.200
I need to contact Interpol.
I'm going to use the radio.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.020
Lupin! Everyone!

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:58.860
Is it a micro black hole
generator?

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.840
Well done, Lambert!

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:07.660
You will regain your
academic prestige.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:10.960
Academic prestige?

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.250
What a banal thing!

01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.600
Now that I've gained
all this power,

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:20.670
do you really think
I care about that?

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.000
What is this?

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:26.750
It's such a trivial thing.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:46.780
Do you have any
idea what you've just done?

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.000
Now that I have The Eclipse...

01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:57.770
I have no reason to be faithful
to Ahnenerbe anymore!

01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.170
You've lost your mind!

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:05.710
What is that look?

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:10.700
Is this how you look at the person who
cared for you your whole life?!

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.800
You ungrateful girl!

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:15.300
You're wrong.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.840
You created me only to
use me in your plans.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.080
And now, you've achieved them.

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:26.710
These achievements of yours
will disappear in the blink of an eye.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.930
How can someone who studies
history not see this?

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:38.520
When you saved me
from the orphanage...

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:41.120
you really loved archeology.

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.920
But you've changed!

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:48.420
Quiet! Shut up!

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.280
Even after witnessing my power,

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.690
you dare mock me?!

01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:58.180
Why?!

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:03.850
Why don't you
recognize my brilliance?!

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.690
I was very offended
by your accusations.

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:15.930
You will spend the rest
of your pitiful life in misery,

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:19.600
suffering for hearing
the world lament!

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.120
What are you doing?

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.190
I will destroy
Ahnenerbe's headquarters...

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.310
and the whole city of Berlin!

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:32.620
The world will fear my power,
and bow to me!

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:36.630
- Your insane?!
- Watch what you say!

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.030
I am the one who will rule
the world!

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:00.320
You're insane.

01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:05.550
The only one who can be the true ruler
of the world is our Führer Hitler!

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.020
What are you doing? Stop it now!

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.150
Grandfather!

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.640
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.730
I used to think of you as just a tool.

01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:00.790
Grandfather!

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:08.060
He died like the crazy
old man he was.

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:12.900
It's over.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.270
I've set the machine to generate a
black hole right here.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.610
All your terrible
plans will end!

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:21.020
You little...

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.440
Well, look at that.
It has a cooldown!

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:47.280
Ahnenerbe headquarters
to Mr. Geralt!

01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:51.290
Immediately transport the
Eclipse to Brazil.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.540
We have located the Führer!

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.780
The Führer! I knew that
his excellency was still alive!

01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:01.290
The Führer wants to see the
Eclipse as soon as possible.

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:05.820
I always knew this day would come!

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:14.970
AHNENERBE,
HEADQUARTERS IN BRAZIL

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.350
Führer!

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:34.050
Is that really you, Führer?

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:38.790
You are Geralt, aren't you?

01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:45.790
All thanks to your efforts, I will be
able to see the light of day once again.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:51.090
I am eternally grateful for your praise.
It is a pleasure to serve.

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:53.800
This is the Eclipse, correct?

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:59.320
I am sure that we will be able to
relive the third reich with it.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.980
Magnificent! Excellent
work, Mr. Geralt!

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.580
Oh, that gun of yours...

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:09.310
I'm so glad you noticed, sir.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.070
It's a Mauser. A pistol
from the third reich.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.700
I remember...

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:19.720
It's such a wonderful pistol...

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:29.340
Stop her!

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.840
Who is this girl?

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:39.130
She is the granddaughter
of Professor Bresson.

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.770
What do you plan to
do to the world?

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:44.330
My young lady.

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:48.100
I just want to create
an amazing world...

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.040
governed by exceptional people.

01:17:57.050 --> 01:18:00.100
What disrespect! This is
unforgivable! I apologize, my Führer!

01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:02.210
Get her out of
here, then get rid of her.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.740
Take her!

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.990
The Eclipse...

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:11.550
fell right into the
hands of the devil!

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.190
Well, I would like to
see the Eclipse up close.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.160
This is the control terminal.

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:28.570
This starts it, and this disc
changes the direction.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.410
Thi-this is not an ideal place!

01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:35.480
I won't use it here, don't worry.

01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:37.270
It's not safe.

01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:42.200
So if I do this, it will work.

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:44.960
I understand everything.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.190
Führer, your legs...

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:50.130
Oh, my!

01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:56.390
It's a miracle!

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.140
Is what I would say if...!

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.530
Why the sad face, Laetitia?

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.570
Mr. Jigen!

01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:14.940
Everyone!

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.560
There were reports of the Eclipse's
movement, so Interpol took action.

01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:26.030
We invaded
and then transmitted...

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.540
...a false communication
to capture Geralt here.

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:31.470
I appreciate your
cooperation, Laetitia - I mean...

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.450
...Miss Bresson!

01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:36.750
Yes!

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.540
We got off the jet
using a parachute.

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:43.620
Even Pops fought by our side.

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:45.590
Life is full of surprises.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.840
Where's Lupin?

01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:32.640
I don't believe it. You are...

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.570
Well, guess the acts up.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.370
I found a sucker!

01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:42.390
Where's the Führer?

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.300
What did you do with him?!

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.270
Nothing! He died a long time ago.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:50.570
You learnt that
in school, didn't you?

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:53.700
He died in 1945.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.270
But, what about this photograph?!

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:59.480
I'm sorry to disappoint
you, but Interpol

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.700
created the photo and circulated it to
see if anyone would reveal themselves.

01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:06.280
They can play pretty
dirty, can't they?

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:10.170
I don't believe this!

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.910
Don't mock the Führer!

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:19.230
That could've been pretty bad...
if you had your bullets.

01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:26.090
Why are you doing this?!

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:29.380
I came to destroy
this, of course!

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.260
And thank's so much for
teaching me how to operate it!

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.070
- Owwies!
- I'll kill you!

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:44.840
Why so violent!?

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.530
Ooh no, how scary!

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:53.930
Why does a petty thief like
you have to get in my way?

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.390
It's easy to explain really.

01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:59.520
We thieves just love to
live through such emotional situations.

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.040
You'll die!

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.970
You will pay dearly! Die!

01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:18.400
That's all, folks!

01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:20.400
Damn you!

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:26.420
I can't stop it!

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:29.530
You idiot! Do you want
to die together?

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.620
Parachute! I won't
let you escape!

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.080
See ya!

01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:01.360
You'll die, too!

01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:06.630
I'll worry about it only
after I kill you, Lupin!

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:17.270
Führer!

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.730
Damn you!

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.960
Führer...

01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.210
Go to hell. Where you both belong.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.920
I did it, grandfather.

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.900
Lupin!

01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:33.000
Lupin...

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.700
Well, looks like Lupin
is out of the picture.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.090
Now I can finally concentrate
on arresting all you...

01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:55.070
Run!

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.280
Stop right there...!

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.960
Lupin, Lupin!

01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:15.030
- Lupin!
- Ah, wait-!

01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:27.310
You did it, Lupin!

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:30.590
The Eclipse is gone. You
don't have to worry about it anymore.

01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:34.890
Everything went well, didn't it?

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.190
Yep.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.970
Humans are waaay too stupid

01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:40.280
to deal with something
so incredibly powerful.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.040
- Lupin...
- Lupin!

01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:54.480
Always on time, Fujicakes.

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.320
I relieved these things
from their collection.

01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:01.720
This took far too much work
just to wind up empty handed.

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.710
See ya soon, Lupin!

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:15.290
Lupin!

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:18.050
Quick! Pops is after us.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:21.410
Will that nut ever give up!?

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:25.140
I suppose this is where we say goodbye.

01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:27.340
Won't you take me with you?

01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:32.680
You aren't tied to
some boss anymore.

01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:34.770
You can go wherever you want.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.930
Coming with us would...
not be a good idea.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.530
Lupin...

01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:47.940
I'm too busy to take care
of a terrible thief like you anyway.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.700
How cruel!

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:51.890
I'm sure we'll meet again sometime.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.390
You take care of yourself.

01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:56.290
I can do that.

01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.380
Before I forget, I
have to deliver this.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.070
It's from Boston University.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.150
Why do you have the letter?

01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:15.650
Wait. How did you
submit my thesis?

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.050
I nicked it from your
apartment and sent it in.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:19.980
Good luck.

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:28.770
They said they are always looking
for new, talented candidates!

01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:35.550
And you're a very talented thief!

01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:37.780
Lupin!

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:40.320
See you, miss!

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:46.180
Come back here, Lupin!

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.070
Lupin!

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.090
I've got you this time!

01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:05.080
Oh my...

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:24.360
I WISH TO CONTINUE SENDING LUPIN
ON ADVENTURES WORLDWIDE.

01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:27.880
