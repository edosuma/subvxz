I suppose we all do, but...

00:08.560 --> 00:10.560

00:10.560 --> 00:14.560
..finding someone to share my life with.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.560
- Yet, she evades me.
- Right.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.560

- Hi.
- So much for therapy.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.760
All they want to do is talk about my dad's sexuality.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.400
Maybe that's the most interesting thing about you.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.560
- Ellie Marsden?
- Extraordinary.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.560
I'm the one running the business. Every package we get is for her.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.560
- I'll take that. Hi, Adam.
- Hey.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.560
- Hang on, I want to know what's in it.
- Let me check.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.560
- As I thought. It's not addressed to you.
- Ellie...

01:32.560 --> 01:35.560
- Ellie!
- Teenagers.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.600
- Yeah, well, you'd know.
- Yeah, he still hates me - Matthew.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.240
Hi, Liv.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.400
Hey, why do you only see therapists who are men?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.920
Well, because I am a man.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.560
What, you don't think a woman

01:45.560 --> 01:47.560
can get an insight into the male psyche?

01:47.560 --> 01:49.560
If you were gonna do therapy, would you consider seeing a man?

01:49.560 --> 01:52.760
- Fair point. I chose a woman.
- What, you've had therapy?

01:52.760 --> 01:54.560
- Yeah.
- Recently?

01:54.560 --> 01:55.560
When I split up with Eddie.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.560
He reckoned the problem was with me, not him.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.240
- I wondered if he might be right.
- God.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.560
- You've had therapy.
- This is the woman I saw.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.560
- You might like her.
- Why? Is she fit?

02:04.560 --> 02:06.560
I'm joking! I'm joking!

02:06.560 --> 02:10.240
Look, she has an interesting approach. You should call her.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.400
Mum...

02:11.400 --> 02:13.560
Sorry, sorry. We'll leave you in peace.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.560
Sorry.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.560
Hiya.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.560
I thought you were going to fix this.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.560
What?

02:24.560 --> 02:27.560
The cupboard. It drives me up the wall.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.560
- It's on my list.
- Anywhere near the top?

02:29.560 --> 02:31.560
Er, I don't know. I've lost the list.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.560
Hey, hey! Ah, ah, ah, that's not for you, cheeky.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.560
Hey, we've got an audition for Lost Days.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.560
- Oh, what?!
- That's great!

02:41.560 --> 02:44.080
Oh, brilliant. That's amazing! Aw.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.560
What's Lost Days?

02:45.560 --> 02:49.560
Oh, it's a festival of art, music and literature.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.560
It's near Macclesfield, I think.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.080
- You've heard of it?
- No.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.560
I just saw the application form on his laptop.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.560
- Oh, Mum, I wish you wouldn't snoop.
- It's not snooping

02:57.560 --> 02:59.560
if you leave it on the screen.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.560
It's only the Emerging Talent Tent, but still...

03:02.560 --> 03:03.560
Hello?

03:03.560 --> 03:05.560
In a former age it was known as the Cavern Club.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.560
Yeah. Hang on a sec.

03:06.560 --> 03:10.560
Well, if you get in, we'll all come and see you.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.400
- Can we?
- Yeah.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.560
It's over 16s.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.400
Aw...

03:17.560 --> 03:19.080
Sorry, yes. Sorry.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.560
I can talk now.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.600
We've got a date for your test here at the hospital.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.240
Tuesday at 11?

03:24.240 --> 03:25.560
Yes, OK. Good.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.080
Er, well, not good.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.560
But, OK.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.560
Yeah, we'll start with some blood tests and then...

03:31.560 --> 03:33.560
We probably won't pass the audition.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.920
Do you want me to drive the van again?

03:34.920 --> 03:36.560
If you don't mind being our roadie.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.080
Well, the money's crap but you get plenty of chicks.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.400
Oh, Dad!

03:40.400 --> 03:41.560
Who was that?

03:41.560 --> 03:44.560
- Hey?
- On the phone.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.560
Oh, erm, I've got an appointment.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.560
I'm going to get my nails done.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.560
Ooh, I could do with a manicure. Shall we go together?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.560
No. No, I want to go on me own.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.240
So, you said on the phone that Karen's an old flame of yours.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.560
Karen?

04:08.560 --> 04:10.560
Oh, no, no. She's an old friend of mine.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.920
Oh, sorry!

04:11.920 --> 04:13.560
I'm a little deaf in my right ear.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.560
Maybe you should hold the phone to your left.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.920
Mm.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.560
Karen's an impressive woman.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.560
Makes you wonder why she'd need therapy.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.920
Oh, I think we could all benefit from learning more about ourselves.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.560
- Well, that's why I'm here.
- Great.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.560
Let me introduce you to the others.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.560
What, so there's, erm...others?

04:30.920 --> 04:33.560
I thought it was just going to be one-on-one.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.560
- Didn't Karen explain how I work?
- No.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.560
No, she was a bit evasive, come to think of it.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.560
Don't worry. You'll quickly get the hang of things.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.560
Everyone, welcome our newest member.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.560
This is Adam.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.560
Hi.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.400
Right, we'll start with a couple of trust exercises.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.080
♪ I'll be glad when you're dead You rascal, you... ♪

05:08.560 --> 05:11.560
When a man is caught being furtive on the internet

05:11.560 --> 05:14.240
it's usually because he's looking at porn.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.400
I was checking the weather.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.560
You're a lousy liar, David.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.400
All right, it was porn.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.560
Like I said, a lousy liar.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.560
Job ads, again?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.560
I'm going to have to put a filter on this.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.560
I need a job.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.560
- Why?
- Because I don't have one!

05:34.560 --> 05:35.760
Or any savings.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.560
I've told you. I've got more than enough for both of us.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.560
It's embarrassing asking you for cash.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.560
I've got you a present.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.560
It's...

05:45.560 --> 05:47.560
..a credit card linked to my account.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.560
No, Nikki. I can't.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.560
David, when you were working and Karen wasn't,

05:52.560 --> 05:55.400
- did you resent the money she spent?
- No, of course not.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.560
Well, there was the occasional dress that caused me to shudder.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.560
So, don't go buying any dresses unless they'd suit me.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.600
OK, so, here's how drama therapy works.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.560
You cast others to play yourself,

06:10.560 --> 06:13.240
your friends, family, whoever,

06:13.240 --> 06:15.560
and then you direct them in a scene from your life.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.560
Why don't you kick us off?

06:21.560 --> 06:22.560
Erm, well...

06:22.560 --> 06:24.560
Er, OK.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.560
Hi, er...

06:30.560 --> 06:31.920
I don't know what to do.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.560
You want to learn more about your relationships, yeah?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.560
Yeah.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.560
How about acting out a typical scene with your friends

06:39.560 --> 06:42.240
to examine how you think they perceive you.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.560
OK.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.560
Erm...

06:45.560 --> 06:47.560
- So, Brenda, was it?
- Yeah.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.560
Would you like to be my best mate Pete? You remind me of him.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.400
In what way?

06:52.240 --> 06:53.560
He's a very warm person.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.560
- Hm.
- Di, you can be Jenny, Pete's wife.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.560
Is she a warm person, too?

06:58.560 --> 07:00.560
Eeeeh...

07:00.560 --> 07:01.560
When you get to know her.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.560
I mean, on the surface, she's more opinionated, a bit spiky.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.560
I can do opinionated.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.240
And spiky.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.560
No, you're going to be great.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.560
Er, and you can be my friend Karen.

07:12.560 --> 07:16.560
She's elegant, sexy, cool.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.560
- Think Lauren Bacall.
- OK.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.560
Erm, David, Karen's ex-husband.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.560
Ah, so, er...Humphrey Bogart?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.920
More Hugh Grant with less charm.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.600
A pompous oaf.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.560
Close enough.

07:28.560 --> 07:33.920
Er, and are you ready to be charming, good-looking, ironic?

07:33.920 --> 07:36.560
- Sure. Who am I playing?
- Me.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.560
So, self-aware as well?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.560
You're doing ironic now, right?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.560
So...

07:42.560 --> 07:45.560
- ..where should we set this scene?
- Erm, OK.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.560
- Pete and Jenny's living room.
- That's you two, then.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.560
Come on, lard-ass, help me shift these chairs.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.560
Oi!

07:51.560 --> 07:53.560
She can't talk to me like that!

07:53.560 --> 07:55.560
Er, no, no...

07:55.560 --> 07:57.560
That's actually eerily accurate.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.920
Good.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.560
Yeah, good.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
Thank you.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.560
- Hi.
- I thought I told you to piss off.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.920
I brought you chocolate.

08:17.560 --> 08:20.560
The nurse tells me you're being discharged today.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.560
So much for patient confidentiality.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.560
Well, to be fair, she wouldn't give me your address.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.560
What she did tell me is you've had no visitors, apart from me.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.560
Not that that's any of your business.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.559
Have you any family? I can tell them where you are.

08:33.559 --> 08:34.559
Look, what is it you want?

08:34.559 --> 08:37.559
I want to make sure that, when you leave here,

08:37.559 --> 08:39.559
you don't do anything stupid.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.559
Look, just cos you saved my life

08:40.559 --> 08:42.600
doesn't mean I need your permission to kill myself.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.560
Would you believe me

08:44.560 --> 08:47.560
if I told you I've been in the same position as you?

08:47.560 --> 08:50.560
What, mithered to death by some sanctimonious gobshite?

08:50.560 --> 08:53.560
No! Looked over the edge. Stared at the abyss.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.400
Look, all I'm saying...

08:59.560 --> 09:02.560
..is I know exactly how you feel.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.920
OK?

Here's my number.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.560
You can call me, any time, day or night. And I mean it.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.560
OK?

09:36.560 --> 09:38.560
It's Pete, isn't it?

09:39.920 --> 09:41.560
Yeah.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.760
OK, Adam's given each of you an extensive...

09:47.760 --> 09:50.560
- Mm-hm.
- ..rundown of your characters.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.560
So, let's explore the dynamic between him and his friends.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.600
- Adam?
- Yes?

09:56.600 --> 09:59.560
- Oh, I'm sorry, yeah.
- You lead off.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.560
Pete, me old mate.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.560
My old mucker.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.560
You know, Jenny's always had the hots for me.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.560
Has she?

10:12.560 --> 10:14.560
Oh, David.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.560
Lover boy always had a way with the girls.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa... What are you doing?

10:18.560 --> 10:20.560
Oh, you said Karen's sexy.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.560
- Yes.
- I'm being sexy.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.560
Perhaps if you were a little less...

10:25.560 --> 10:28.760
- Obvious.
- Let's get back on track.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.560
You know, Adam's always had a very high opinion of himself.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.760
Mm, to be fair, I did have a crush on him when I was at school.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.560
And there was that moment years later

10:42.560 --> 10:43.560
when you made a pass at him.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.560
That's right, you did.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.600
The truth is she's always carried a torch for me.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.560
In your dreams!

10:51.560 --> 10:53.560
We're just mates now.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.400
Well, no, Jen, deep down, you still have feelings for me.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.560
Why would you want her to?

10:57.560 --> 11:01.760
Because Adam needs to feel he can have any woman he turns his mind to.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.560
Not much of a friend, if it includes my wife.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.560
There is a vein of selfishness that runs through him.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.560
Not his most attractive quality.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.560
- And then there's his arrogance.
- Arrogance?!

11:11.560 --> 11:14.560
Yeah, the way you regard yourself as the lead singer

11:14.560 --> 11:16.560
and the rest of us as the backing vocals.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.600
- Like Boy George.
- And Culture Club.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.600
Erm...

11:30.760 --> 11:33.560
This helps me how, exactly?

11:50.560 --> 11:51.560
How was school?

11:55.560 --> 11:56.560
How's your meal?

11:59.400 --> 12:00.560
Matt, I cooked you your dinner.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.560
The least you could do is acknowledge that.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.240
Thank you, Father.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.600
This sauce is delicious. Did you microwave it yourself?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.560
Maybe irony is genetic.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.240
Matt, I've apologised about Gemma.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.560
I don't know what else I can do.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.560
Well, that's the problem right there, isn't it?

12:21.560 --> 12:22.560
Hm?

12:24.560 --> 12:27.240
My mates' dads make dad jokes.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.080
We laugh about them behind thier backs. They're embarrassing.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.560
But you're excruciating.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.600
You're so keen to be down with the kids.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.920
Don't you understand?

12:37.920 --> 12:39.560
I don't want you to be my friend.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.760
I want you to be my dad.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.560
OK.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.560

14:30.560 --> 14:32.560
Well, he gave me money so I could,

14:32.560 --> 14:35.600
but he'd have never known what suited me or fit me.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.560
You are clever.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.600

Hello.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
Yep, that's fine.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.560
- If you just take a seat over here for me.
- OK, thanks.

Ambulance bay.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.560
Sorry about before.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
Hey, it's a jungle out there.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.240
You do or say whatever you need to.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.560
Yeah.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.560
It's not true, is it?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.560
What you said about three months.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.560
Who knows?

17:15.560 --> 17:18.760
If I'm not here in three months, that's your answer.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.560
Olivia, do you know what Ellie's ordering online?

17:33.560 --> 17:35.560
Er, she's not, I don't think.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.560
You're covering for her is laudable.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
Slightly undermined by the evidence.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.560
- She's not buying stuff. They're gifts.
- For her birthday?

17:45.560 --> 17:46.560
Well, she's had a lot.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.560
She's rinsing men.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.560
I have no idea what that means.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.560
She makes friends with men on the internet and they send her gifts.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.560
What?!

18:03.920 --> 18:06.920
- I'm just using my initiative.
- No, you are prostituting yourself!

18:06.920 --> 18:09.560
Urgh, why won't you listen? It's got nothing to do with sex!

18:09.560 --> 18:11.560
I cannot believe you're being so stupid!

18:11.560 --> 18:13.560
No, I'm sorry. I mean naive.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.560
- We never meet.
- They know where you live!

18:15.560 --> 18:18.400
- We just talk over webcam.
- About what?

18:18.400 --> 18:20.600
Nothing! Movies I've seen. Music I like.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.600
- Why would they care?
- Thanks, Mum!

18:22.600 --> 18:24.560
No, what I mean is, what's in it for them?

18:24.560 --> 18:27.560
Friendship. They're just lonely, that's all.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.560
What, in exchange for that, they buy you gifts?

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
I suggest stuff they might like to send me.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.560
You know, a pair of shoes, a necklace I've seen.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.560
Can you not see what's wrong with that?

18:36.560 --> 18:39.560
- They're bound to want more!
- Well, they're not going to get it.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.560
I don't know why you're having a go at me, you should be proud.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
- What?!
- Men have always used women.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.560
But now I'm the one in control. I'm not being exploited.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.560
No, they are! That's not feminism!

18:50.560 --> 18:53.560
That was your generation's struggle. We're way beyond all that.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.560
So, you use the freedoms that we won to get men to buy you stuff.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
- Designer labels.
- I want you to stop.

18:58.560 --> 19:02.560
Mum, it's fine. You just don't understand, that's all.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.560
You've had a busy day. A battery of tests.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.560
Too right. I feel like a toasted sarnie.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.560
There's a cafe near the entrance.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.560
Oh, no, I meant, you know, literally.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
Like I've been Brevilled.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.560
It's good you can see the funny side.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.560
You need a sense of humour.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.560
Do I, seriously?

19:38.560 --> 19:41.560
Some people prefer to wait till we have all the results.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.560
Well, good for them.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.560
But, I mean, if you know something already, then...

19:48.400 --> 19:50.560
..I want to, too, please.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.560
We'll need to see the outcome of your biopsy to be sure.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.560
But I have to say your test results are highly suspicious

19:59.560 --> 20:00.560
and indicative of cancer.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
OK.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.560
Thank you.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.560
Oh, God.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.560
Oh, shit.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.560
- Hello.
- Hey.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.560
- I didn't mean to intrude.
- No.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.560
It's, erm...

21:17.560 --> 21:18.560
It's fine.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.560
Sorry. Erm...

21:21.560 --> 21:22.560
Were you waiting for me?

21:23.560 --> 21:26.560
I just thought I'd check to see you're OK.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.560
Have you got a minute?

21:31.560 --> 21:32.560
Yeah.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.560
Till my parking runs out.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.560
So, you got the news that no-one wants.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.560
I knew it was a possibility or...

21:59.760 --> 22:01.920
It doesn't make it any less of a shock.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.760
No.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.400
You don't have to talk.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.560
We can just sit a while.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.560
You're in therapy?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.560
No. No, I'm doing drama therapy.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.760
- There's a difference.
- In what way?

22:45.760 --> 22:48.240
Well, for starters, I don't think it works.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.560
But it's good fun. It's a bit like am-dram, but it's all about you.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.560
Ah, yeah, I can see why you like it. No!

22:54.560 --> 22:56.560
It can be quite confronting.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.920
But people say very harsh things. You do.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.080
Me?

23:00.080 --> 23:03.240
Yeah, someone plays you and then we all improvise scenes together.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.560
- So, what's he likes?
- Who?

23:04.560 --> 23:06.240
- The bloke who plays Pete.
- Here you go.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.560
Oh, you know, erm...

23:07.560 --> 23:10.560
- You cheeky git. What, fat?
- No!

23:10.560 --> 23:11.760
- I've lost shed-loads!
- Not fat.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.560
Big-boned.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.560
- She's very nice, though.
- She?

23:15.560 --> 23:16.560
She?!

23:16.560 --> 23:19.560
- Oh, I'm not being played by a woman.
- That's a bit sexist, Pete.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.560
There aren't enough men. I'm played by a woman, too.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.560
- I bet she's not big-boned.
- Well, you know...

23:23.560 --> 23:25.560
I'll get this.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.560
- What? Have you come into money?
- After a fashion.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.760
Oh, hang on a minute.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.560
Isn't that...?

23:30.560 --> 23:33.560
That's Nikki. Yeah. It's a present.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.920
So you're constantly reminded of who's money you're spending?

23:35.920 --> 23:37.560
- Yeah, it cute, isn't it?
- Or controlling.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.560
You're a kept man.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.560
I prefer to see it as redressing the gender imbalance.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.560
David Marsden, the feminist.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.560
Well, one has to do one's bit.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.560
I'm watching you, David.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.560
So, erm...how are you getting on?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.560
I just can't see any hope.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.920
I don't know what there is to live for.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.400
Well, if you kill yourself, you'll never find out.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.760
Look, I once felt like you.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.560
I've sat where you are. And now I'm sat next to you.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.560
And one day, you'll be sat next to someone

24:26.560 --> 24:29.560
and you'll be telling them the same thing.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.560
It's going to be a crowded bench.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.560
Look, my point is, hang in there.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.560
Things'll get easier.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.560
You know, and once your medication takes effect...

24:38.560 --> 24:41.560
- You said that yesterday.
- It's 24 hours closer to kicking in.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.240
Oh, sorry.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
Adam?

24:47.560 --> 24:49.560
Where are you? We're meant to be there.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.560
Oh, shit! Sorry.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
Something's come up.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.560
Can you rearrange?

24:55.560 --> 24:57.560
- Dad, it's an audition.
- Look, I know. I know.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.560
- I'll call you in a minute.
- Oh, forget it.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
Adam?

25:00.560 --> 25:01.560
Adam!

25:01.560 --> 25:02.920
Oh...!

25:02.920 --> 25:04.560
Evan, wait!

25:04.560 --> 25:05.600
Evan!

25:08.560 --> 25:09.760
Oh!

25:11.080 --> 25:12.560
Rinsing?

25:12.560 --> 25:14.560
- I've never heard of it.
- I know.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.560
They think of new ways to torment you.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.560
I've got all this to come with our Chloe, I suppose.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.400
No, she's a great girl.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.560
Plus, she's got you and Pete.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.560
Oh, my God...

25:27.560 --> 25:28.560
What?

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
Are you OK?

25:31.560 --> 25:33.560
Yes. Er, sorry.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.560
I... I am. Of course, yes. Miles away.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.080
Whoa!

25:37.080 --> 25:38.560
What's this?

25:38.560 --> 25:41.560
That is a manuscript that my business partner's asked me to read,

25:41.560 --> 25:43.560
written by a friend of his.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.560
Nina B St James. Never heard of her.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.560
No, and you never will. Even the title's crap.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
Love Comes Slowly.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.560
- Romance or porn?
- Chic lit.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.560
The sort of useless dross young women lap up

25:54.560 --> 25:56.560
when they could actually be thinking.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
- Not that I've read it.
- You are such a snob.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.560
- I know.
- Well, it sounds good.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
I'll read it.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.560
Good. Thanks.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.240
Tell me something nice I can say about it.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.760
I could do with the distraction, frankly.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
OK, who hasn't had a turn yet?

26:12.560 --> 26:15.560
Adam, would you like to perform another scene?

26:15.560 --> 26:17.560
I don't know. Is everyone just going to have a go at me?

26:17.560 --> 26:20.240
You mentioned the other day that you have a son.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.240
Matt. Yeah. He's, erm...17.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.560
He's a great kid.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.560
Karen, who you play, that's his godmother.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.920
We're not getting on very well at the minute.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.560
- You and Karen?
- No, Matt and I. Erm...

26:30.560 --> 26:33.400
He thought I was trying to get off with his girlfriend.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.400
- Maybe I should let someone else have a go.
- No.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.560
No.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.560
- Have you and Matt talked about this?
- Not much.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.560
He did shout at me.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.760
Why don't you try and explain yourself to him?

26:47.760 --> 26:50.560
Oh. Erm...

26:51.560 --> 26:53.560
Yeah, OK.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.560
OK. Who'll be Matt? Erica?

26:55.560 --> 26:58.560
- Can I be me?
- Yeah.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.760
Oh, shall I be Karen again?

27:00.760 --> 27:02.560
Erm, sure. Yeah, why not?

27:02.560 --> 27:03.760
Oh, er, maybe not so...

27:05.400 --> 27:06.560
..sexy this time.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.560
- I can't help it.
- No.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.400
OK, so, er, the scene is...

27:12.400 --> 27:13.560
..we're at home.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.560
Karen's turned up. I'm not sure why.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.400
And, erm, I'm talking to Matt.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.560
Why were you hitting on my girlfriend?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.240
Well, erm...

27:26.240 --> 27:27.560
..it was a misunderstanding.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.560
You know, I...I never knew that she was.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.560
And you think that makes it OK?

27:32.560 --> 27:33.600
He's right, Adam.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.560
What kind of sick individual tries to pull women

27:36.560 --> 27:38.560
- young enough to be his daughter?
- Well...

27:38.560 --> 27:40.560
..they're generally a wee bit older than that.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.560
This boy never knew his mother.

27:42.560 --> 27:46.560
Which means the example you set him is even more important.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.560
But...you think I'm failing as a father?

27:56.560 --> 27:59.560
You're not showing him how to have a long and lasting relationship.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.560
I can't.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.560
I've tried.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.560
Angela, Tina...

28:04.560 --> 28:06.560
But it never quite works.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.560
Is it because of my mum?

28:11.560 --> 28:13.560
She set the bar pretty high.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.920
I'd like to talk about her more.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.760
Would you?

28:18.760 --> 28:21.560
You said yourself, we don't much.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.560
I'm never sure you want to, so I don't bring her up.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.560
Which makes me think you don't want to.

28:28.560 --> 28:32.560
Oh, God, I'd love to make her real in your mind,

28:32.560 --> 28:34.560
but I never feel that my words will do her justice.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.240
Just hearing you talk like this

28:38.240 --> 28:40.400
makes me realise how special she was.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.560
Oh...

28:42.560 --> 28:44.560
She was.

28:45.920 --> 28:49.560
- Wasn't she?
- I never knew her, Adam.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.920
But I can well believe it.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.560
And so can I.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.560
I need to go.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.240
Matt?

29:23.560 --> 29:25.560
Can I show you something?

29:36.920 --> 29:39.240
Are you sure you want to watch this?

29:39.240 --> 29:40.560
I used to when I was a kid.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.240
I liked seeing it.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.240
Are you sure you do?

29:47.560 --> 29:48.560
Yeah.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.560
♪ Wake up, step up to reality...

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
♪ In the morning when I wake

30:09.400 --> 30:11.760
♪ And the sun is coming through

30:13.920 --> 30:17.560
♪ Oh, you fill my lungs With sweetness

30:19.560 --> 30:22.560
♪ And you fill my head with you

30:24.560 --> 30:26.560
♪ Shall I write it in a letter?

30:29.240 --> 30:31.560
♪ Shall I try to get it down?

30:33.920 --> 30:37.560
♪ Oh, you fill my head with pieces

30:39.400 --> 30:41.560
♪ Of a song I can't get out

30:43.560 --> 30:46.600
♪ Can I be close to you? ♪

30:47.560 --> 30:49.560
I miss her.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.560
I miss the idea of her.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.560
♪ Can I be close to you?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.560
♪ Oooh

30:59.920 --> 31:02.240
♪ Oooh. ♪

31:03.560 --> 31:05.560
I'm going to stop seeing women half my age.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.600
You need a mum.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.560
Not a big sis or...

31:13.560 --> 31:16.240
..or an aunt you might fancy.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.560
And I need...

31:22.560 --> 31:25.560
..not someone who'll replace your mum.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.560
Someone to succeed her...maybe.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.560
But even that's not easy.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.560
I loved her so much. I mean, look at us.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.560
The thought of spending the rest of my life with someone else...

31:51.760 --> 31:53.560
..it still seems like...

31:55.560 --> 31:58.560
..deep down, a sort of a betrayal.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.560
I think Mum would just want you to be happy, Dad.

32:30.060 --> 32:31.740
Oh, Ian. Hi.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.060
You owe me an essay.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.060
Yeah, sorry about that.

32:36.060 --> 32:38.060
I need an extension.

32:38.060 --> 32:40.060
Actually, you know what, I might need to defer my place.

32:40.060 --> 32:43.060
Why? You're doing so well.

32:43.060 --> 32:47.060
Thanks. Yeah, I am... I'm loving it.

32:47.060 --> 32:50.060
It's just I've got stuff going on at home.

32:50.060 --> 32:53.060
- It makes it difficult to study.
- I see. Er...

32:53.060 --> 32:54.060
Would it help to talk about it?

32:54.060 --> 32:57.260
The university has a very good counselling service.

32:57.260 --> 33:01.060
Don't they mainly deal with sexually transmitted diseases?

33:01.060 --> 33:04.900
And students whose selfies aren't getting enough likes.

33:06.060 --> 33:09.060
I'd rather not say anything for the minute to anyone.

33:09.060 --> 33:12.060
Not until I know exactly what I'm dealing with.

33:12.060 --> 33:14.100
Well, er, take as much time as you need,

33:14.100 --> 33:17.060
but keep me abreast of developments.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.060
So, what do you think?

33:30.060 --> 33:33.260
She takes a good photo, Ellie.

33:33.260 --> 33:36.060
Sorry. That's not what you want to hear.

33:36.060 --> 33:39.100
She won't listen to me. I thought about confiscating her laptop,

33:39.100 --> 33:42.060
- but then she'd still have a phone.
- Well, take that, too.

33:42.060 --> 33:44.060
But then I've got no way of getting hold of her, have I?

33:44.060 --> 33:45.060
Oh, God.

33:45.060 --> 33:47.580
It's not easy being a single parent, is it?

33:47.580 --> 33:50.060
- You can't do good cop, bad cop.
- But I do bad cop pretty well.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.060
Hm.

33:54.060 --> 33:56.060
Jeez, Karen, it's tricky. I don't know what to suggest.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.100
No, Jen didn't either.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.060
So, come on, then. How's your therapy going?

34:00.060 --> 34:02.060
Ah!

34:02.060 --> 34:03.900
Ah-ha, it's brilliant.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.060
I'm a changed man.

34:05.060 --> 34:07.060
Unrecognisable.

34:08.060 --> 34:10.060
Hey...

34:10.060 --> 34:13.060
Maybe this will, erm, sort itself out.

34:13.060 --> 34:15.060
God, I hope so.

34:15.060 --> 34:17.060
Yeah.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.060
OK, when the water boils, that's when you add the pasta.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.060
Why do I need to know this? I'm 14.

34:21.060 --> 34:23.060
I should be watching YouTube.

34:23.060 --> 34:25.060
Cos you need to learn some independence.

34:25.060 --> 34:28.060
You can't rely on me always being there to do it for you.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.900
Why? Have you got other plans, love?

34:31.260 --> 34:33.060
Iron the sleeves first, OK?

34:33.060 --> 34:35.060
- I'm home.
- Collar and sleeves.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.060
Dad! Save us!

34:37.060 --> 34:39.100
Mum's trying to teach us life skills.

34:41.060 --> 34:43.060
Are you all right, son?

34:43.060 --> 34:46.060
Adam, please, hello. You're meant to be watching this.

34:46.060 --> 34:49.060
- You might be in digs next year.
- I'll just eat Pot Noodles.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.580
That got me through uni.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.100
Yeah, One-Pot Pete.

34:52.100 --> 34:54.060
- Oh, shit.
- What?

34:54.060 --> 34:57.060
It's an e-mail from the festival.

34:57.060 --> 34:59.060
- Well, go on, open it!
- I can't.

34:59.060 --> 35:01.060
Oh, give it here.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.060
Well?

35:06.060 --> 35:08.060
You got in!

35:08.060 --> 35:09.060
Aw...!

35:09.060 --> 35:11.060
Oh, brilliant!

35:14.060 --> 35:16.060
What's Teed Off?

35:16.060 --> 35:19.060
- Huh?
- You spent, erm, £48 there.

35:19.060 --> 35:21.060
They sell golfing equipment.

35:21.060 --> 35:24.060
- Are you checking up on me?
- No, I'm just checking for fraud.

35:24.060 --> 35:26.060
- Balls.
- Don't you do that?

35:26.060 --> 35:28.060
Hm? No, I meant golf balls.

35:28.060 --> 35:31.060
- That's what I bought.  -
- Oh. They're expensive, aren't they?

35:31.060 --> 35:33.060
- Don't lose them.
- Lose my balls...

35:33.060 --> 35:34.580
I already have.

35:36.060 --> 35:38.060
- Nikki?
- Yeah?

35:38.060 --> 35:39.060
I hate to say this, but...

35:39.060 --> 35:42.060
Urgh, your struggling with not being the bread-winner.

35:42.060 --> 35:44.420
I'm sorry. Sorry, go on.

35:44.420 --> 35:48.060
I know you don't like me getting cash out with your credit card,

35:48.060 --> 35:51.060
but...I'm running a bit low.

35:51.060 --> 35:53.060
Just take some out of my purse.

36:01.740 --> 36:04.060
You won't spend it all on sweets, will you, David?

36:04.060 --> 36:06.060
No, I won't. Thank you, Nikki.

36:08.060 --> 36:11.420
Oh, God...

36:15.060 --> 36:17.260
A big break for the lad, eh, this festival?

36:17.260 --> 36:20.060
No, thanks to you they got in.

36:21.060 --> 36:23.060
Our Adam said you missed the audition.

36:23.060 --> 36:25.740
Lucky Ian could take them.

36:25.740 --> 36:27.900
- Ian?
- My tutor. You know that.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.060
Where were you anyway?

36:30.060 --> 36:32.060
Oh, you weren't with that Evan?

36:32.060 --> 36:33.420
Pete, for goodness' sakes.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.420
Well, they got in, didn't they?

36:35.420 --> 36:37.580
It feels like you spend more time with him

36:37.580 --> 36:39.740
- than you do with us at the minute.
- He needs me, Jen.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.420
- What about his family?
- He hasn't got one.

36:42.420 --> 36:44.060
Yeah, well, you do.

36:46.060 --> 36:49.060
And they're going to need you more than ever, Pete.

36:49.060 --> 36:50.060
Why?

36:54.060 --> 36:57.060
I don't know. Kids, they're at that stage, aren't they?

36:57.060 --> 36:58.060
Look...

36:59.060 --> 37:04.060
I know you mean well, Pete, but you're not doing Evan any favours.

37:04.060 --> 37:05.740
The more he uses you as a crutch,

37:05.740 --> 37:08.060
the more he'll come to depend on you.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.060
That's not fair on anyone.

37:12.580 --> 37:14.060
Hm?

37:26.060 --> 37:29.100
Hello, Rex. You're a first-time caller, I believe?

37:29.100 --> 37:31.260
Uh, yes. A virgin, you might say.

37:31.260 --> 37:33.060
Well, welcome to my world.

37:33.060 --> 37:36.060
Do you want to turn your webcam on?

37:36.060 --> 37:38.740
- I'm a little shy.
- Don't be.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.900
We're all friends here.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.060
That's better.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.900
- Adam!
- Hi, Ellie.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.060
Rex is my online name.

37:48.060 --> 37:51.060
So, how does this thing work? Should I start?

37:51.060 --> 37:53.100
Those photos on your home page are lovely.

37:53.100 --> 37:56.060
- Adam, this is weird.
- Why?

37:56.060 --> 37:58.060
- Because I know you.
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

37:59.740 --> 38:03.060
So, isn't it weirder if you don't know the person?

38:03.060 --> 38:05.060
Did my mum put you up to this?

38:05.060 --> 38:08.060
No, she doesn't know. She might think it's a bit creepy.

38:08.060 --> 38:09.060
It is!

38:09.060 --> 38:12.060
Yeah. The whole thing is, Ellie, all of it.

38:12.060 --> 38:15.060
Some sad-sack in Stoke can't get a date,

38:15.060 --> 38:17.060
so he resorts to befriending hot chicks online.

38:17.060 --> 38:20.060
- Adam.
- And don't pretend there isn't a sexual element to it.

38:20.060 --> 38:22.260
I mean, not for you, but...

38:22.260 --> 38:25.580
Ellie, what do you think the first thing these guys do

38:25.580 --> 38:27.060
when they log off?

38:28.900 --> 38:31.060
Exactly. You're better than that, Ellie.

38:31.060 --> 38:33.060
You know, you're smart.

38:33.060 --> 38:37.060
It's not an inappropriate thing for me to say, you're beautiful.

38:37.060 --> 38:39.060
Don't sell yourself short.

38:39.060 --> 38:42.060
Don't sell yourself at all.

38:45.060 --> 38:46.740
OK.

38:46.740 --> 38:48.260
Hey, I'll see you at your birthday, eh?

38:48.260 --> 38:50.060
Oh...

38:50.060 --> 38:51.580
What would you like as a present?

39:02.060 --> 39:04.420
- I thought you said I could call you any time.
- Well, I did.

39:04.420 --> 39:07.060
I just didn't think it'd be so often.

39:07.060 --> 39:09.260
Oh, so, "I'll always be there for you, Evan"

39:09.260 --> 39:12.060
actually means between six and eight on alternate Wednesdays.

39:12.060 --> 39:15.060
Well, I take my daughter to dance on Wednesdays.

39:16.060 --> 39:18.740
Look, you're doing really well. Your medication's kicking in.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.060
You don't need me.

39:21.060 --> 39:24.060
- Are you breaking up with me?
- It's not like that.

39:25.060 --> 39:27.060
It feels like that.

39:27.060 --> 39:30.060
Like when me dad walked out, the same rejection.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.060
Look, Evan, please.

39:32.060 --> 39:34.060
Well, there are other people out there

39:34.060 --> 39:36.420
who can help you better than me.

39:36.420 --> 39:39.060
Your doctor, old friends,

39:39.060 --> 39:41.260
the Samaritans.

39:41.260 --> 39:43.580
I can't do this.

39:45.060 --> 39:47.060
I'm sorry, I've got to go.

39:49.060 --> 39:52.060
Right, well, if I kill myself, it'll be on you!

39:56.060 --> 40:01.060
♪ Night

40:01.060 --> 40:04.060
♪ Goes slowly

40:04.060 --> 40:05.900
♪ Night

40:08.740 --> 40:12.060

40:16.060 --> 40:17.580
Hey, that's sweet!

40:18.420 --> 40:21.060
We didn't do such a bad job, did we?

40:21.060 --> 40:24.060
Oh, this is great, Mum. Thank you.

40:24.060 --> 40:27.060
Oh, these are from Matt and me.

40:27.060 --> 40:30.060
Tickets for Lost Days.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.060
- Oh, so we can come and see you!
- Fantastic.

40:32.060 --> 40:34.060
- We all will.
- You're coming?

40:34.060 --> 40:36.060
- Well, we all are.
- I'm not.

40:36.060 --> 40:39.060
Oh, no, we've gotta be at the lad's first festival gig.

40:39.060 --> 40:42.060
- We're glamping.
- Your dad doesn't do tents any more.

40:42.060 --> 40:44.420
- Did he ever?
- Don't worry, we won't cramp your style.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.060
No, it's just I'd planned to revise that weekend.

40:47.060 --> 40:50.060
- What does your first legal drink taste like?
- Like all the others.

40:50.060 --> 40:53.060
Oh, thanks for the necklace, by the way. I love it.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.580
Thanks for letting us come to your party.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.060
Oh, this? God, no, this is just pre's.

40:57.060 --> 41:00.060
Mum's idea. We're meeting mates later.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.060
Soon, I hope.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.060
Oh, well.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.060
Normal service resumed.

41:12.060 --> 41:13.060
Aren't you driving?

41:15.060 --> 41:17.060
Is that a question or an instruction?

41:17.060 --> 41:18.580
No, it's just...

41:18.580 --> 41:21.060
..if you are, perhaps you shouldn't have any more.

41:27.060 --> 41:30.060
Or we can always get a cab. You could pick up the car tomorrow.

41:30.060 --> 41:32.060
Hm.

41:32.060 --> 41:34.740
Because, of course, I've got nothing better to do.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.580
So, you and Ellie seem good.

41:40.580 --> 41:43.900
Yeah, we are. Deliveries have stopped.

41:43.900 --> 41:46.060
She is no longer rinsing men.

41:46.060 --> 41:49.060
- Really?
- Yeah. So, she must listen to me after all.

41:49.060 --> 41:52.060
- No, I don't think that's it.
- What?

41:52.060 --> 41:54.060
You're welcome.

41:54.060 --> 41:55.100
Are you all right?

41:58.060 --> 42:01.260
Well, we're not sure because we don't know what our Adam's doing.

42:01.260 --> 42:04.260
But we were thinking of going to Corsica, weren't we?

42:04.260 --> 42:06.060
Yeah.

42:06.060 --> 42:09.060
Hey, why don't we all get a place together?

42:09.060 --> 42:11.260
Oh, yeah, I'm in. Yeah, that sounds fun.

42:11.260 --> 42:14.420
- So long as it doesn't clash with Florida.
- Florida?

42:14.420 --> 42:17.060
Yeah, I want to go and check out apartments as an investment.

42:17.060 --> 42:20.060
Right. Oh, it's the first I've heard of it.

42:20.060 --> 42:22.580
Apparently, we're going to Florida.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.060
Oh, nice.

42:24.060 --> 42:25.060
No, I was just saying...

42:25.060 --> 42:27.420
Yeah, we all know what you're saying, Nikki.

42:27.420 --> 42:30.060
What do you mean by that David?

42:30.060 --> 42:32.060
Oh, it's Evan.

42:32.060 --> 42:36.060
- Should I get it?
- He's not your responsibility.

42:36.060 --> 42:39.060
I should get it.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.060
Pete...

42:40.060 --> 42:42.060
Ellie just told me what you did.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.740
- Yeah, you asked me to help.
- Not like that!

42:44.740 --> 42:47.900
- Hm?
- What gave you the right to do that?

42:47.900 --> 42:50.060
You take me for granted! You don't treat me with respect!

42:50.060 --> 42:53.060
- That's ridiculous!
- It's gas-lighting!

42:53.060 --> 42:55.060
- Oh...
- Yeah, yeah, I listen to Woman's Hour.

42:55.060 --> 42:57.740
- Exactly!
- He's a man. He's a grown man.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.060
I know he's a grown man!

42:59.060 --> 43:00.060
I'll have that.

43:00.060 --> 43:01.900
- Hey...
- Stop it!

43:01.900 --> 43:03.060
Give it here.

43:03.060 --> 43:05.100
If it was such a good idea, why didn't you tell me?

43:05.100 --> 43:08.060
You didn't tell me cos you knew you'd crossed the line.

43:08.060 --> 43:10.060
I was being bad cop, remember? It worked, didn't it?

43:10.060 --> 43:12.060
No, it didn't work.

43:12.060 --> 43:13.740
- Pub?
- Yeah. Let's go.

43:13.740 --> 43:15.740
Don't leave me...!

43:28.060 --> 43:30.100
I'm sorry you feel that I belittle you. I don't mean to.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.060
I know!

43:32.060 --> 43:34.580
- It's my fault.
- I don't mind giving you money.

43:34.580 --> 43:36.740
Well, I mind having to take it.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.580
I'm sorry, but I hate this card!

43:38.580 --> 43:41.060
Every time I use it, I just see your face mocking me.

43:41.060 --> 43:42.580
Well, it was meant as a joke.

43:42.580 --> 43:44.060
The joke's on me.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.060
Oh, we can't carry on like this.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.060
I don't know why we are.

43:52.060 --> 43:54.260
We don't seem to have much in common, Nikki.

43:54.260 --> 43:57.060
- Well, opposites attract.
- Yeah, I think the magnetism's long gone.

44:02.060 --> 44:04.060
I think we should call it a day.

44:07.060 --> 44:10.060
- Split up after one row this evening?
- No.

44:10.060 --> 44:13.060
It's just that I've begun to despise myself.

44:13.060 --> 44:16.060
And it's only a matter of time before you despise me, too.

44:34.060 --> 44:36.060
When I'm 18, I'm going to have a stretch limo,

44:36.060 --> 44:38.060
sparklers,

44:38.060 --> 44:42.740
Quidditch and those little cocktails with the little umbrellas on them.

44:42.740 --> 44:45.060
- Will me and your mum be invited?
- No.

44:45.060 --> 44:46.060
What?!

44:46.060 --> 44:49.420
Of course you will. I couldn't have my 18th without you, could I?

44:51.060 --> 44:53.060
Go on. It's late.

44:53.060 --> 44:55.060
Go up to bed.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.260
Don't forget your teeth.

44:57.260 --> 45:00.060
I best start saving to pay for it all.

45:00.060 --> 45:03.060
- You've got three years.
- Yeah, well, you've got big plans.

45:03.060 --> 45:05.060
- What about a bouncy castle?
- I'll be 18!
