<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

00:02.375 --> 00:04.583
I told you, Rudy. I can't break a board.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.208
Okay look, let's just try one last thing.

00:07.625 --> 00:10.667
Close your eyes and use your imagination
to break a board,

00:10.875 --> 00:12.667
and then you can try
to break one for real.

00:12.750 --> 00:13.750
All right.

00:17.208 --> 00:18.250
Hiyah!

00:18.959 --> 00:20.709
Yes! I did it!

00:23.875 --> 00:26.250
Hey, where have you guys been?
You're an hour late.

00:26.625 --> 00:29.834
I was over at Build-a-Bunny.
Look what I made for my lady.

00:30.125 --> 00:32.500
This is gonna make her absolutely plotz.

00:35.083 --> 00:36.625
I just went over to Stickyhons.

00:37.125 --> 00:38.083
And I did them both.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.125
Oh, okay.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.291
It must be nice!

00:43.375 --> 00:45.166
Just brambling about the mall,

00:45.250 --> 00:46.667
living la vida loca.

00:47.625 --> 00:50.417
I wouldn't know because I'm here 24-7.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.667
Teaching classes, paying bills,

00:52.750 --> 00:54.792
sucking the sweat stains
out of these mats.

00:55.542 --> 00:57.667
Which reminds me... I gotta get a vacuum.

00:59.291 --> 01:01.166
Bobby called earlier and said
he was coming by.

01:01.792 --> 01:03.250
What? Quick, get your gis on.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.250
I don't want to miss Bobby's big entrance.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.625
- Oh yeah.
- Totally.

01:06.709 --> 01:08.542
Bobby doesn't make
those entrances anymore.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.083
He's really started to embrace
his role as a leader,

01:11.166 --> 01:13.834
a mentor, a dignified zen master.

01:13.917 --> 01:16.792
<i>Whoo-hoo! Whoo</i> !
-

01:23.625 --> 01:25.291
Word to the wise.

01:25.375 --> 01:27.667
"Never buy a jetpack at a garage sale!"

01:29.583 --> 01:31.750
Bobby, what brings you to our dojo?

01:32.250 --> 01:34.709
Oh, let me show you.

01:39.709 --> 01:43.125
May I present a teaching machine
so advanced...

01:43.792 --> 01:47.125
it will revolutionize karate
as we know it.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.834
- Behold!
-

01:52.250 --> 01:53.291
Whoa!

01:53.625 --> 01:56.792
I give you The Wasabitron 3,000.

02:02.041 --> 02:04.417
Okay, if this thing
has a vacuum attachment,

02:04.500 --> 02:05.583
I'm gonna plotz!

02:58.250 --> 03:00.166
Wow, you hear that, Jack?

03:00.250 --> 03:01.125
It called me...

03:01.208 --> 03:02.583
flawless.

03:04.625 --> 03:07.959
My mother has a very strict
no-sparring-with-robots policy.

03:08.291 --> 03:09.667
I have a note in here somewhere.

03:11.333 --> 03:15.208
"Rabbits, rodeo clowns... rabbis?"

03:16.166 --> 03:17.417
Oh, here it is.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.208
Robots.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.291
<i>This note is a forgery.</i>

03:30.959 --> 03:32.125
Oh!

03:32.959 --> 03:34.250
That was awesome.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.250
Most productive morning ever!

03:39.542 --> 03:41.083
Thanks to our friendly Robot,

03:41.208 --> 03:43.291
I paid all my bills, filed my taxes,

03:43.375 --> 03:45.917
and now all I have left to do
is get rid of my junk mail.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Ooh.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.083
Awesome.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.750
Hey, Rudy, check this out.

04:01.709 --> 04:05.125
<i>Rotate your shoulder
90 degrees for a successful defense.</i>

04:05.250 --> 04:07.000
He's right. You didn't turn your shoulder.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.709
Whoa! Thanks, robot.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.583
-You know what?
-You guys seem like
you're in pretty good hands here,

04:20.667 --> 04:23.542
so I'm just gonna run out
and get a couple of things done.

04:23.875 --> 04:24.750
Okay?

04:28.583 --> 04:31.542
Okay, you bag of bolts,
let's do this thing.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.750
<i>I am not programmed
to spar with orangutans.</i>

04:41.041 --> 04:42.333
Can you believe this thing?

04:42.917 --> 04:44.500
It thinks I'm an orangutan.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.166
Hey, not cool, man.

04:46.542 --> 04:47.625
Not cool.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.250
You know, I don't think
I trust that robot.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.625
Did you ever notice that
in every robot movie,

04:58.709 --> 05:00.792
they always end up going bad
and trying to takeover?

05:00.875 --> 05:02.709
No, not every movie.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.834
What about
"Killer Robots Takeover the Earth"?

05:04.917 --> 05:06.291
In that one they...

05:08.500 --> 05:10.542
Oh yeah, uh-huh.

05:11.834 --> 05:13.375
I know what we need to do.

05:13.625 --> 05:17.083
We need to download its operating system
onto this flash drive

05:17.166 --> 05:18.959
and find out what makes it tick.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.709
Yeah, you can't trust machines.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.917
Every Wednesday night my grandmother tries
to go to her knitting class,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.208
but her electric wheelchair takes her
to the neon stallion nightclub.

05:28.542 --> 05:29.750
Is that true?

05:30.083 --> 05:32.458
Dude, she rolled by
the bus stop this morning

05:32.583 --> 05:35.375
and was all "Whoot-whoot! Whoot-whoo"

05:45.125 --> 05:46.000
Whoa!

05:48.417 --> 05:51.291
I think this robot
is making me better. Whoo!

05:52.917 --> 05:55.250
Great move, Jack,
but I would have followed that up

05:55.333 --> 05:57.792
- with a spinning back kick.
- Ah, thanks, Kim,

05:57.875 --> 05:59.667
but I think I know what I'm doing.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.542
<i>She is correct.</i>

06:02.834 --> 06:05.208
Sorry, Jack. Just being flawless.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.542
Gimme some.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.208
<i>Hey, it's Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.</i>

06:11.291 --> 06:12.625
<i>It's Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.</i>

06:13.166 --> 06:15.208
<i>Answer your phone. It's Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.</i>

06:15.291 --> 06:17.083
Yo, if that's Milton,
I need to talk to him.

06:18.291 --> 06:19.500
- Hey, Rudy.
- Hey, Jack.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.291
Just wanted to make sure
everything was okay there.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.625
Yeah, yeah, everything's great.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.625
Good. Hey, I'll be back at the dojo

06:24.750 --> 06:27.375
as soon as I take care of some
urgent business that just can't wait.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.250
All right, sounds good. See ya.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.083
Whoo, hoo, hoo!

07:06.542 --> 07:08.375
When I put this flash drive
in my computer,

07:08.458 --> 07:10.917
we'll know the truth
about our robot friend.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.792
What's it say?

07:14.875 --> 07:15.959
I don't know yet.

07:16.041 --> 07:18.375
I just realized I got a little hummus
on my keyboard.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.291
Okay, here we go.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.417
Oh, no!

07:25.250 --> 07:29.458
The way his system is configured he can't
process erratic computational variances.

07:29.583 --> 07:33.083
Oh, no, no! This can't be happening!

07:34.375 --> 07:35.709
Wait, what does that mean?

07:37.542 --> 07:40.458
It means that when he realizes
that humans aren't perfect,

07:40.542 --> 07:43.417
his circuitry won't accept it
and he'll become unpredictable

07:43.500 --> 07:45.166
and progressively more violent.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.417
What do we do?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.792
We must devise a plan to save...

07:49.375 --> 07:51.000
all of humanity!

07:51.583 --> 07:53.500
Yes, save...

07:53.959 --> 07:55.709
all of humanity.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.959
Can we start after 7:00?
I have a cello recital.

08:06.375 --> 08:10.250
I feel great and that is not
just the mani-pedi talking.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.417
-Hiyah!

08:15.375 --> 08:17.375
Kim, you just broke three boards!

08:17.458 --> 08:18.291
That's right.

08:18.375 --> 08:21.083
I had no idea what I could do
until this robot came along.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.375
Hey, Rudy, check this out.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.500
The robot taught me
this amazing bokken routine.

08:24.625 --> 08:25.542
Check it.

08:32.291 --> 08:33.208
Hiyah!

08:35.667 --> 08:37.291
Yeah, that's not bad.

08:37.792 --> 08:38.875
It's a good start.

08:40.375 --> 08:41.375
I got a few tips on...

08:42.083 --> 08:43.834
whatever it is you were just doing there.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.417
Yo, Rudy, check it.

08:51.542 --> 08:54.000
It's all you, Ro-bro. Whoo!

08:54.125 --> 08:57.166
Yeah! Dude, that is awesome.

08:57.458 --> 09:00.250
But, um... I'm back now, so...

09:00.333 --> 09:03.500
I'm just gonna go change into my gi
and then we can get to work, okay?

09:04.583 --> 09:05.625
Wait for me.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.166
Bobby, hey. Uh...

09:11.750 --> 09:12.792
what are you doing here?

09:13.166 --> 09:14.417
We're friends, right?

09:14.959 --> 09:15.792
Of course.

09:15.875 --> 09:18.375
And friends, they can tell
each other anything, right?

09:18.458 --> 09:19.709
Absolutely.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.875
Rudy, my friend, You're fired.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.250
What?

09:24.333 --> 09:26.834
I'm sorry. But in the time that
you've been gone, I've realized I...

09:27.458 --> 09:28.917
don't really need you.

09:29.542 --> 09:31.333
I've been gone for one day!

09:32.750 --> 09:34.291
I'm sorry, Rudy.

09:34.375 --> 09:35.709
It's just business.

09:36.583 --> 09:37.625
But I'm afraid you're...

09:38.208 --> 09:39.375
obsolete.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.041
Obsolete?

09:41.667 --> 09:42.959
I'm obsolete?

09:43.333 --> 09:45.834
I will tell you who is obsolete!

09:49.959 --> 09:52.000
I am obsolete.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.583
-
<i>Again, again, again.</i>

10:01.041 --> 10:03.917
Dude, come on, I need a break!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.125
You've been pushing me hard for two days.

10:06.583 --> 10:08.792
Hey look, here comes Kim! Train with her.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.375
You like her. Yeah.

10:12.041 --> 10:13.417
Hey, robot.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.083
You ready to train with me?

10:15.583 --> 10:17.291
<i>Your training days are over.</i>

10:17.375 --> 10:19.667
<i>You are no longer the model of efficiency.</i>

10:20.917 --> 10:23.000
Oh, let me guess, here we go.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.959
Once again it's Jack.

10:26.291 --> 10:27.166
<i>incorrect.</i>

10:27.250 --> 10:29.250
<i>It is the Snack-o-matic vending machine.</i>

10:30.250 --> 10:32.417
You're saying a vending machine
is better than me?

10:34.542 --> 10:37.917
<i>It is perfect. I have been
extracting Jolly Whoppers from it all day.</i>

10:40.125 --> 10:42.458
<i>Here is a quarter. Use it for G-11.</i>

10:43.041 --> 10:43.917
G-11?

10:44.667 --> 10:46.458
<i>It is mints. Your breath is--</i>

10:47.834 --> 10:49.291
I had a garlic knot.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.125
Okay, two.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.667
That thing is really getting on my nerves.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.208
It stopped letting me practice
because it thinks I'm a monkey.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.667
Would you quit it?

11:07.542 --> 11:10.667
Let's go tell Rudy we want him to haul
this piece of junk out of here.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.542
That's it! Let's talk to Rudy.
This is his dojo.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.667
Listen, before we go talk to Rudy,

11:19.750 --> 11:21.291
Could you hit G-11? Your breath is--

11:21.375 --> 11:22.542
Oh, shut it.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.959
Yes, yes, we are the home
of the Robotic Sensei.

11:27.291 --> 11:29.917
Mm-hm. He knows all major disciplines.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.834
Karate, Jujitsu, Tae Kwon Do.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.625
"Flung Pu"?

11:36.041 --> 11:38.458
No, I've never heard of Flung Pu.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.083
Sir, why are you laughing?

11:43.166 --> 11:45.208
Oh, I'm sorry, could you hold on
for one second?

11:45.875 --> 11:47.041
Bobby, where's Rudy?

11:47.125 --> 11:50.792
I fired him and replaced him
with The Wasabitron 3,000.

11:50.917 --> 11:51.792
What?

11:52.333 --> 11:54.917
Have you guys ever Flung Pu--
Oh, just got it!

11:56.291 --> 11:57.583
Not funny!

12:01.917 --> 12:03.709
I've been thinking about our problem.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.959
We're going to have to fight robot power
with robot power.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.250
And this is how we're gonna do it.

12:09.375 --> 12:10.500
Behold!

12:12.500 --> 12:13.709
A bowl of fruit?

12:14.083 --> 12:15.000
What?

12:15.333 --> 12:17.500
No, this is my mother's sketch pad.

12:17.583 --> 12:18.875
Behold!

12:20.125 --> 12:23.125
- The Milton-ator.
- Ah, nice.

12:23.500 --> 12:28.542
Together, we're gonna build the most
powerful robot in the history of mankind.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.166
-
- Oh, dude, my foot.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.625
- My foot.
- One second.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.166
- Let's go ice that.
- Yeah.

12:41.625 --> 12:44.000
<i>Mi amor, Isabella. Te amo mucho.</i>

12:46.041 --> 12:48.083
No, no, don't do it, Isabella.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.917
He's got a grenade behind his back!

12:51.500 --> 12:53.458
Oh, no, sorry. It was a puppy.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.250
Nope, it was a grenade.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.417
- Who is it?
<i>It's Jack, Kim and Jerry.</i>

13:01.583 --> 13:02.625
Uh, coming.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.625
Look, I already have an offer

13:19.709 --> 13:23.166
to personally train Jean-Claude Van Diesel
for his next movie,

13:23.250 --> 13:26.667
so unless you can beat that,
don't call me again.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.291
Sorry,

13:29.500 --> 13:31.291
the phone's been ringing off the hook.

13:31.417 --> 13:32.792
I'm getting so many job offers,

13:32.875 --> 13:34.875
It's like, "Give me some space, people!"

13:35.750 --> 13:38.083
Rudy, we know you weren't
really talking to anybody.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.542
What?

13:40.959 --> 13:42.125
That's a remote.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.625
You're a remote.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.583
How's your robot sensei?

13:50.625 --> 13:52.917
Making you better at karate?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.750
We're better, but we're miserable.

13:57.291 --> 13:59.709
Rudy, we're here because we need you
back at the dojo.

14:00.166 --> 14:03.083
We all got caught up in the excitement
of that wasabi wind-up toy, but...

14:03.959 --> 14:05.458
Dude, that thing's not you.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.291
The robot's a better teacher.
You guys don't need me.

14:08.375 --> 14:10.667
- Are you kidding?
- Of course we need you.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.625
Rudy, that thing isn't our friend.

14:12.709 --> 14:13.917
Come on, you are.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.959
Compose yourself, big fella.

14:22.208 --> 14:23.125
So...

14:24.000 --> 14:25.709
what you guys are saying is
you want me back?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.333
More than anything.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.542
Then I'm gonna do what I should have done

14:31.000 --> 14:32.875
I'm gonna fight for my dojo!

14:32.959 --> 14:34.417
Yes, good for you.

14:34.542 --> 14:35.834
Go get 'em, Rudy!

14:36.542 --> 14:37.959
<i>Adios, Isabella!</i>

14:41.583 --> 14:42.583
Whoa.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.875
That dude had a puppy-grenade, yo. Whoo.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.125
Finally!

14:51.250 --> 14:53.417
You picked a great time
to go to the dentist.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.542
I had to go. I had a cavity.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.333
Let me just take off my backpack.

14:58.458 --> 15:02.000
There's no time! Our robot is ready
to be brought to life!

15:02.834 --> 15:03.750
Go plug this in.

15:03.834 --> 15:06.041
Yes, Milton. I must plug this in.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.875
That cable runs up
to the antenna on the roof.

15:09.959 --> 15:13.500
Soon the storm will be at its peak
and we'll have the power we need!

15:19.083 --> 15:20.959
Yes, the time is now.

15:21.291 --> 15:23.083
Quickly! Attach the clamps to the robot.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.125
Yes, Milton! Yes, Milton!

15:34.083 --> 15:35.625
Holy Christmas nuts!

15:36.458 --> 15:38.291
- It's alive!
- Yes.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.250
- It's alive!
- Yes!

15:47.750 --> 15:50.208
Ow, stop! Take it easy, you.

15:51.125 --> 15:52.750
I bruise like a banana.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.709
You realize with one phone call

15:55.792 --> 15:58.333
I can have you turned
into a karaoke machine?

15:58.834 --> 16:00.500
<i>That result will not happen.</i>

16:02.291 --> 16:03.375
You fool!

16:03.917 --> 16:07.291
I just got to level eight
on Angry Pigeons!

16:08.709 --> 16:11.709
<i>I detect hostility.
Prepare to defend yourself.</i>

16:11.834 --> 16:13.834
What? Who? Me? No, no, no,

16:13.917 --> 16:16.500
I wasn't hostile.
I was a tad miffed maybe.

16:16.917 --> 16:18.750
<i>Engaging in combat.</i>

16:19.625 --> 16:20.500
Fine.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.792
Prepare to face...

16:23.709 --> 16:24.875
the dragon.

16:31.083 --> 16:31.959
Dragon out!

16:33.709 --> 16:34.709
Bobby, what's wrong?

16:35.208 --> 16:36.166
Oh, nothing much,

16:36.250 --> 16:38.083
just that robot's trying to kill me!

16:38.166 --> 16:41.083
All right, time for a plan.
Let's not do anything rash.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.083
Going in.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.750
<i>You cannot
shut me off, monkey.</i>

16:47.417 --> 16:49.542
<i>I eliminated the power-down option.</i>

16:52.500 --> 16:54.125
He, uh, he eliminated the power-down--

16:54.208 --> 16:55.291
We heard!

16:56.959 --> 16:59.000
<i>Now it's time to eliminate
all of you,</i>

16:59.083 --> 17:00.500
<i>because you will never be perfect.</i>

17:03.208 --> 17:07.333
Stand back, mortals.
We're here to save you all.

17:07.417 --> 17:10.500
Mere flesh and blood is no match
for a machine.

17:10.834 --> 17:13.125
For it must be a machine
that takes down a machine.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.875
Prepare to meet the robot that I created

17:15.959 --> 17:19.000
that will annihilate
this mechanical monstrosity.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.291
Yes, yes, yes.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.041
I give to you...

17:22.875 --> 17:25.500
the Milton-ator!

17:43.667 --> 17:45.917
Really? Really! That's it.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.500
What do you want? I spent all
my money on jumper cables.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.583
This has gone on long enough.

17:53.709 --> 17:55.875
I'm throwing you out my dojo.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.083
Get him, Rudy.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.000
Oh!

18:03.083 --> 18:04.000
Come on, Rudy!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.083
Go.
Get him! Oh!

18:09.208 --> 18:11.291
<i>Someone dispose
of your sensei.</i>

18:11.750 --> 18:12.667
I'm not done.

18:13.291 --> 18:14.792
I'm just getting started.

18:15.166 --> 18:18.792
<i>The chances of you
defeating me are over 22.8 million to one.</i>

18:18.875 --> 18:20.291
Why do you continue to fight?

18:21.250 --> 18:22.750
Because I have something you don't.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.625
Internal bleeding, a fractured tibia,

18:25.709 --> 18:27.542
and a spleen with some
of my own teeth in it...

18:29.041 --> 18:30.166
But more importantly...

18:30.959 --> 18:32.125
I got heart.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.250
It's why I'll never quit.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.083
- Yeah, Rudy!
- Come on!

18:37.333 --> 18:38.583
Oh!

18:40.625 --> 18:41.667
That's it.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.250
Come on, Jack.
Oh, oh.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.000
Yo, how many more times
do we have to this?

19:19.083 --> 19:20.333
As many times as it takes.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.083
I didn't want to do it at the first time.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.542
<i>These continued attacks
are illogical.</i>

19:25.625 --> 19:26.792
Not to us.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.458
We live by The Wasabi Code.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.834
That's something that Rudy taught us.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.458
We swear by the light
of the dragon's eye

19:34.542 --> 19:36.750
to be loyal and honest and never say die.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.208
Wasabi!

19:39.291 --> 19:41.250
<i>Impossible code. Wasabi code.</i>

19:41.291 --> 19:42.875
- <i>Impossible...</i>
- Milton, what's going on?

19:43.667 --> 19:47.125
It can't process the fact that we know
we can't win, but we'll never give up.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.542
-
- <i>Unable to compute.</i>

19:48.625 --> 19:49.917
<i>Unable to compute.</i>

19:50.000 --> 19:51.709
<i>Unable to...</i>

19:55.625 --> 19:57.291
We don't hit a man when he's down.

19:57.834 --> 19:58.750
But the thing is...

19:59.291 --> 20:00.375
you're not a man.

20:04.959 --> 20:06.583
I've got to hand it to you, Rudy.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.291
That was a classy move.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.166
I mean, fighting to get your dojo back,

20:11.250 --> 20:13.375
not kicking the robot in the motherboard.

20:14.959 --> 20:17.875
You know what? I should probably have
the other robots destroyed.

20:17.959 --> 20:19.458
Rudy, can I have my jetpack?

20:20.458 --> 20:21.875
Fine, I'll take the bus!

20:25.083 --> 20:26.834
Guys, I just want you to know that...

20:27.667 --> 20:29.458
as long as you're a part of this dojo,

20:29.875 --> 20:31.458
it'll always be worth fighting for.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.000
Get in here!

20:36.417 --> 20:37.625
Ew, what's that smell?

20:37.709 --> 20:39.083
It's Kim's breath.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.250
It is not! My breath is fine.

20:42.417 --> 20:43.625
Hey, why don't you shut up?

20:44.083 --> 20:45.959
♪ Kickin' it with you ♪

20:50.834 --> 20:52.041
This is great!

20:54.250 --> 20:55.375
You know, Milton-ator...

20:55.709 --> 20:57.291
You weren't much of a robot,

20:57.417 --> 20:59.000
but you're a heck of a vacuum.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.500
That's weird. It's not turning off.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.834
You don't scare me, puny little vacuum.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.458
I've seen what you can do.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.583
Did you just squirt oil at me?

21:20.959 --> 21:21.834
Okay.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.583
Let's do this.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.125
Milton?

21:29.458 --> 21:30.625
Milton?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.208
Milton!
