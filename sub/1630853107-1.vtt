You didn't say that when I put the gun to

I got a reputation on the line and I want
my money. You always getting yourself into

00:07.080 --> 00:13.740
some stuff for real. Yo, Trell what's up man
did you kill him?

00:13.740 --> 00:17.260
And I just want you to have somebody like
him instead of that damn Trell. I'm just sick

00:17.260 --> 00:24.180
of him. I don't know why you need a loan for
anyway. Don't your man sell dope? If you don't

00:24.180 --> 00:34.399
want to help. I'll do it myself. Don't let
me come looking for you, alright brother.

00:34.399 --> 00:55.729
