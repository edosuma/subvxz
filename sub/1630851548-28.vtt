09:41.800 --> 09:43.966
WITH THE SEATS ACTUALLY MOVE,

09:44.033 --> 09:45.000
YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE WITH A

09:45.066 --> 09:46.933
RUNAWAY TRAIN -- IT'S LIKE THAT,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.833
THE TOWN SQUARE IS NOT PASSIVE,

09:48.900 --> 09:51.333
THE TOWN SQUARE IS ACTUALLY

09:51.400 --> 09:52.366
AFFECTING HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE

09:52.433 --> 09:55.800
WHAT THEY DO, IT'S PART OF THE

09:55.866 --> 09:58.000
PROBLEM, PART OF THE EQUATION.

09:58.066 --> 09:59.500
>> THE COMPANIES TRY TO

09:59.566 --> 10:00.866
DEFEND -- THEY ARE HOLDING UP A

10:00.933 --> 10:02.866
MIRROR TO SOCIETY, IF YOU POST

10:02.933 --> 10:04.000
CRAZY PEOPLE WHO ARE POSTING

10:04.066 --> 10:05.533
CRAZY THINGS, WE ARE SHOWING A

10:05.600 --> 10:06.900
MIRROR TO SOCIETY BUT THESE

10:06.966 --> 10:08.566
THINGS ARE NOT A MIRROR, IT'S

10:08.633 --> 10:11.066
MORE OF A FUN HOUSE MIRROR.

10:11.133 --> 10:15.533
WHOEVER HAS THE MOST DIVISIVE

10:15.600 --> 10:17.633
THING, WE HAVE A TRILLION DOLLAR

10:17.700 --> 10:19.000
COMPANY WITH THE MOST POWERFUL

10:19.066 --> 10:20.000
SUPERCOMPUTER IN THE WORLD

10:20.066 --> 10:22.033
POINTING AN AI AT YOUR BRAIN

10:22.100 --> 10:23.366
BEING LIKE WHAT'S THE NEXT FAULT

10:23.433 --> 10:24.800
LINE IN SOCIETY THAT WILL

10:24.866 --> 10:26.200
MASSIVELY OUTRAGE OR CONVICT

10:26.266 --> 10:27.633
SYSTEM AND WHATEVER THAT ANSWER

10:27.700 --> 10:29.833
TO THAT QUESTION IS, IT'S USING

10:29.900 --> 10:30.466
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF COMPUTE

10:30.533 --> 10:33.433
POWER TO FIGURE IT OUT, IT PUTS

10:33.500 --> 10:35.233
THAT AT THE CENTER OF THE ENTIRE

10:35.300 --> 10:35.666
WORLD.

10:35.733 --> 10:37.866
YOU LET SOCIETY RUN THROUGH THAT

10:37.933 --> 10:42.466
TFOR TEN YEARS AND YOU WONDER WY

10:42.533 --> 10:43.100
IT'S INSANE.

10:43.166 --> 10:47.500
IT'S A BAD TRIP, WE HAVE THIS

10:47.566 --> 10:49.233
ENTIRE MIND WAR TAKING PLACE BUT

10:49.300 --> 10:50.666
THE BUSINESS MODEL OF

10:50.733 --> 10:52.266
ENGAGEMENT, GETTING WHATEVER IT

10:52.333 --> 10:52.900
TAKES TO GET PEOPLE ENGAGED IS

10:52.966 --> 10:55.100
THE KEY.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.400
>> Bill: YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING

10:56.466 --> 10:58.800
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS NOT

10:58.866 --> 11:00.233
CENSORSHIP BECAUSE WE DO EXPECT

11:00.300 --> 11:01.066
FACEBOOK TO DO SOME OF THAT AND

11:01.133 --> 11:04.133
WE'LL GET INTO THAT, SOME OF THE

11:04.200 --> 11:05.733
THINGS THEY HAVE CENSORED I

11:05.800 --> 11:10.700
DON'T THINK ARE RIGHT.

11:10.766 --> 11:13.200
YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING THE

11:13.266 --> 11:16.400
PROBLEM IS THIS ENGAGEMENT ISSU

11:16.466 --> 11:17.833
ISSUE.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.300
IT'S NOT CENSORING STUFF, YOU

11:19.366 --> 11:20.300
WANT THESE PEOPLE TO BE CHICKEN

11:20.366 --> 11:23.400
FIGHTING EACH OTHER ALL THE TIM

11:23.466 --> 11:26.066
TIME.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.266
PEOPLE HAVE TO STOP TALKING

11:27.333 --> 11:28.900
POLITICS ALL THE TIME, WE NEVER

11:28.966 --> 11:33.233
USED TO DO THIS, WE DIDN'T CARE

11:33.300 --> 11:34.133
WHAT KID WE WENT TO THIRD GRADE

11:34.200 --> 11:36.333
WITH THOUGHT ABOUT

11:36.400 --> 11:42.333
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND WE SHOULDN'

11:42.400 --> 11:44.033
SHOULDN'T!

11:44.100 --> 11:45.633
>> I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO

11:45.700 --> 11:47.566
SAY -- IT WILL ALWAYS FIND,

11:47.633 --> 11:49.500
POLITICS IS WHAT GENERATES

11:49.566 --> 11:50.600
ENGAGEMENT.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.333
IT WILL ALWAYS SORT FOR

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
POLITICS, IT'S A VALUES BLIND

11:55.466 --> 11:57.266
MACHINE.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.333
JUST IN THE SAME WAY WAR IS GOOD

11:59.400 --> 12:02.366
FOR GDP, DRUGS ARE GOOD FOR GDP,

12:02.433 --> 12:04.766
PROSTITUTION IS GOOD FOR GDP, IN

12:04.833 --> 12:06.033
A VALUES BLIND ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM

12:06.100 --> 12:08.066
FOR ATTENTION, ADDICTION IS GOOD

12:08.133 --> 12:09.566
FOR GDP, BODY ISSUES FOR TEEN

12:09.633 --> 12:11.966
GIRLS IS GOOD FOR GDP, OUTRAGE

12:12.033 --> 12:12.933
THAT MAKES PEOPLE HATE THEIR

12:13.000 --> 12:16.433
FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN IS

12:16.500 --> 12:18.166
GOOD FOR GDP, WE HAVE TO HAVE

12:18.233 --> 12:19.033
VALUES AND WE CAN'T HAVE A

12:19.100 --> 12:20.900
MACHINE THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S

12:20.966 --> 12:22.000
TRUE, BECAUSE THEN WE IT INTO

12:22.066 --> 12:23.800
CONTENT MODERATION ISSUES.

12:23.866 --> 12:25.600
>> Bill: LET ME GIVE YOU AN

12:25.666 --> 12:27.033
EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW IT VERY WELL.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.433
FOR FOUR MONTHS PEOPLE CANNOT

12:28.500 --> 12:31.833
TALK ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE

12:31.900 --> 12:32.566
CORONAVIRUS.

12:32.633 --> 12:33.800
BECAUSE IT BECAME A POLITICAL

12:33.866 --> 12:34.200
ISSUE.

12:34.266 --> 12:36.033
I SAID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

12:36.100 --> 12:38.533
THIS DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL

12:38.600 --> 12:39.566
DIMENSION.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.600
DID THIS ORIGINATE IN THE LAB,

12:42.666 --> 12:43.433
POSSIBLY, OR DID IT ORIGINATE

12:43.500 --> 12:45.900
FROM PEOPLE EATING BATS IN THAT

12:45.966 --> 12:52.633
FARMERS' MARKET FROM HELL.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.500
WE STILL DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT

12:54.566 --> 12:55.466
NOW EVEN THE BIDEN

12:55.533 --> 12:56.866
ADMINISTRATION SAYS WE DON'T

12:56.933 --> 12:57.933
KNOW, WE LOOKED INTO IT, IT

12:58.000 --> 12:59.400
CERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN THE

12:59.466 --> 13:00.766
OTHER ONE, FOR FOUR MONTHS,

13:00.833 --> 13:04.866
PEOPLE WERE FORBADE TO DISCUSS

13:04.933 --> 13:06.700
THE LAB ORIGIN THEORY, THAT'S

13:06.766 --> 13:08.200
OUTRAGEOUS, TRUE?

13:08.266 --> 13:10.600
>> YES, I AGREE WITH YOU.

13:10.666 --> 13:15.966
>> Bill: OH, GOOD.

13:16.033 --> 13:16.233
[LAUGHTER]

13:16.300 --> 13:16.500
[APPLAUSE]

13:16.566 --> 13:17.866
>> THERE ARE TWO SIMULTANEOUS

13:17.933 --> 13:20.000
VALUES WE WANT TO BE HONORING.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.133
ONE IS FOR FREE EXPRESSION, WHAT

13:22.200 --> 13:23.333
IS FREE-SPEECH FOR?

13:23.400 --> 13:24.933
FOR CONSCIOUS EVOLUTION OF THE

13:25.000 --> 13:25.566
SYSTEM.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.600
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO A QUESTION

13:27.666 --> 13:28.500
MAINSTREAM ESTABLISHMENT

13:28.566 --> 13:29.233
NARRATIVE, THERE WAS A WHIRL

13:29.300 --> 13:35.500
BEFORE CIVIL CIVIL RIGHTS, THE

13:35.566 --> 13:37.466
PROBLEM IS WE HAVE THE KIND OF

13:37.533 --> 13:38.600
FREE SPEECH WHERE EVERYBODY

13:38.666 --> 13:39.433
WHO'S SAYING EVERYTHING, THE GUY

13:39.500 --> 13:42.433
WHO SAYS THE CRAZIEST, MOST

13:42.500 --> 13:44.200
DIVISIVE THING THAT BAD FAITHS

13:44.266 --> 13:46.766
THE OTHER SIDE AND DEEPENS THE

13:46.833 --> 13:50.733
DASH WHY MY OTHER SIDE IS RIGHT,

13:50.800 --> 13:51.833
WE AREN'T HEARING FROM

13:51.900 --> 13:52.833
OCCASIONALLY TO GET PEOPLE

13:52.900 --> 13:53.700
BREAKING THROUGH ACTUALLY WE

13:53.766 --> 13:57.033
SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO THIS LAB

13:57.100 --> 13:58.800
THING, BUT THE REST OF THE

13:58.866 --> 14:00.466
BALANCE SHEET IS BASICALLY CRAZY

14:00.533 --> 14:00.666
TOWN.

14:00.733 --> 14:03.033
WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD GETS

14:03.100 --> 14:05.666
CRAZY TOWN, THAT BREAKS SOCIETY.

14:05.733 --> 14:06.866
OPEN SOCIETIES PLUS THIS

14:06.933 --> 14:07.866
BUSINESS MODEL, THEY CANNOT

14:07.933 --> 14:10.833
ALLOW THAT THING TO CONTINUE.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.633
>> Bill: BUT IT'S NOT JUST

14:13.700 --> 14:15.366
CRAZIES, I DID AN EDITORIAL AT

14:15.433 --> 14:16.333
THE END OF THE SHOW RECENTLY

14:16.400 --> 14:19.966
ABOUT THE PHONE, THE BASIC

14:20.033 --> 14:21.100
THESIS OF IT WAS

14:21.166 --> 14:23.133
STRAIGHTFORWARD, THE PHONE MAKES

14:23.200 --> 14:28.166
PEOPLE ASSHOLES.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.733
THIS IS NOT CRAZY PEOPLE, THAT

14:29.800 --> 14:32.100
IS EVERYBODY, IT MAKES YOU

14:32.166 --> 14:33.466
SHADY, PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE,

14:33.533 --> 14:41.533
NEEDY, FA FAKE, AND MEAN.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.900
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ON AT

14:42.966 --> 14:44.600
ALL THE TIME, WHICH IS THE

14:44.666 --> 14:46.200
YOUNGER GENERATION, WOULD YOU

14:46.266 --> 14:47.633
AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT?

14:47.700 --> 14:47.966
>> COMPLETELY.

14:48.033 --> 14:52.166
IT BREAKS THE WAY EVOLUTIONARY,

14:52.233 --> 14:56.166
FUNDAMENTALLY WE ARE RUNNING AN

14:56.233 --> 14:57.633
EVOLUTIONARY MEAT SUIT LIVING IN

14:57.700 --> 15:00.733
MODERNITY, WE HAVE PALEOLITHIC

15:00.800 --> 15:02.366
BRAINS BUT WE HAVE GODLIKE

15:02.433 --> 15:04.300
TECHNOLOGY AND FEEBLE

15:04.366 --> 15:07.033
INSTITUTIONS.

15:07.100 --> 15:07.800
IF I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU AND IT

15:07.866 --> 15:11.300
HURTS YOUR FEELINGS, HAVE

15:11.366 --> 15:13.266
EVOLVED INSTINCTS TO READ IT ON

15:13.333 --> 15:13.833
YOUR FACE.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.000
>> Bill: YOU SAID MEAT SUIT

15:15.066 --> 15:16.866
AND YOU SAW I WAS DELIGHTED TO.

15:16.933 --> 15:18.600
>> I GET DELIGHTED ON THE OTHER

15:18.666 --> 15:20.133
SIDE.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.433
>> Bill: WHEREAS IF YOU TEXTED

15:22.500 --> 15:26.566
MEAT SUIT, WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY

15:26.633 --> 15:28.000
THAT?

15:28.066 --> 15:28.800
THERE'S NO EMOJI.

15:28.866 --> 15:29.133
[LAUGHTER]

15:29.200 --> 15:30.700
>> IT BREAKS THE FEEDBACK LOOP,

15:30.766 --> 15:32.200
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS

15:32.266 --> 15:33.266
TECHNOLOGY THAT POINTS THE

15:33.333 --> 15:35.266
MIRROR BACK AT OURSELVES, WHAT

15:35.333 --> 15:36.900
DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN, WITH

15:36.966 --> 15:38.033
ONE OF THE WAYS WE EMPATHIZE

15:38.100 --> 15:40.166
WITH EACH OTHER AND WE NEED MORE

15:40.233 --> 15:41.066
OF THIS.

15:41.133 --> 15:43.233
ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE SO

15:43.300 --> 15:44.433
VULNERABLE TO ADDICTION IS

15:44.500 --> 15:45.633
ADDICTION IS HYPER NORMAL

15:45.700 --> 15:47.400
STIMULI, YOU GET EXTRA HITS OF

15:47.466 --> 15:48.533
DOPAMINE JUST LIKE IN OUR

15:48.600 --> 15:50.233
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WE GET EXTRA

15:50.300 --> 15:52.066
HITS OF SALT, SUGAR, FAT, THEY

15:52.133 --> 15:52.900
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE RARE, THEY

15:52.966 --> 15:57.466
ARE HYPER NORMAL STIMULI.

15:57.533 --> 16:00.500
WE GET UNDER STIMULATED WITH

16:00.566 --> 16:01.333
REAL CONNECTION BECAUSE OF COVID

16:01.400 --> 16:03.200
OR WE ARE ON OUR PHONES ALL THE

16:03.266 --> 16:04.833
TIME, WE ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO

16:04.900 --> 16:06.033
THAT ADDICTION.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.366
THE LIST OF FILLING OUR NATURAL

16:07.433 --> 16:08.066
ENVIRONMENT IS, THE MORE

16:08.133 --> 16:16.066
VULNERABLE WE ARE.

16:16.133 --> 16:16.600
[APPLAUSE]

16:16.666 --> 16:17.700
>> Bill: ONE FINAL QUESTION

16:17.766 --> 16:18.333
I'M GOING TO LEAD INTO IT I'M

16:18.400 --> 16:21.300
GOING TO TALK WITH THE PANEL,

16:21.366 --> 16:24.133
AI'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOIG

16:24.200 --> 16:25.966
ON WITH THE NEXT ELECTION.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.833
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW FACEBOOK HAS

16:27.900 --> 16:29.200
INFLUENCED DEMOCRACIES OVERSEAS,

16:29.266 --> 16:32.966
GIVE US THE SKINNY ON THAT.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.666
>> PART OF WHAT'S IN

16:34.733 --> 16:35.200
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

16:35.266 --> 16:36.500
RELEASES IS HOW IT HAS MADE

16:36.566 --> 16:38.966
POLITICAL PARTIES ACROSS THE

16:39.033 --> 16:41.800
WORLD OR NEGATIVE AT SCALE.

16:41.866 --> 16:42.833
ONE THINGS TO RECOGNIZE --

16:42.900 --> 16:44.833
>> Bill: WHAT COUNTRIES,

16:44.900 --> 16:46.033
HUNGARY, POLAND?

16:46.100 --> 16:48.433
>> SPAIN, TAIWAN, THINGS LIKE

16:48.500 --> 16:49.400
THIS.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.866
ONE THING TO RECOGNIZE IS WE GET

16:50.933 --> 16:53.233
THE BEST VERSION OF FACEBOOK

16:53.300 --> 16:54.666
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO

16:54.733 --> 16:56.633
PLEASE THE REGULATORS, THEY HIRE

16:56.700 --> 16:58.600
AS MANY CONTENT MODERATORS AS

16:58.666 --> 16:59.100
THEY CAN.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.200
AS MUCH AS EVERYONE HATES

17:00.266 --> 17:01.766
EVERYTHING GOING WRONG, IF

17:01.833 --> 17:03.466
YOU'RE IN MEXICO ONE OF THE

17:03.533 --> 17:04.100
THINGS IN

17:04.166 --> 17:04.733
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" PIECE

17:04.800 --> 17:06.766
IS USED ON VIDEOS AND PHOTOS OF

17:06.833 --> 17:08.300
BAGS OF SEVERED HANDS, PEOPLE

17:08.366 --> 17:11.233
GETTING SHOT IN THE HEAD IN YOUR

17:11.300 --> 17:13.300
NEWSFEED, YOU GET THE MOST

17:13.366 --> 17:15.433
UNFILTERED FEED FOR THESE

17:15.500 --> 17:16.966
COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE

17:17.033 --> 17:19.066
CONTENT MODERATION.

17:19.133 --> 17:20.266
90% OF FACEBOOK'S USERS ARE

17:20.333 --> 17:21.233
OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.566
IT'S JUST LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE,

17:22.633 --> 17:24.066
THE DEVELOPING WORLD GETS THE

17:24.133 --> 17:27.366
WORST OF IT, WE GET THE BEST

17:27.433 --> 17:28.466
VERSION AND WE STILL HAVE

17:28.533 --> 17:30.833
WILDFIRES HERE, THE DEVELOPING

17:30.900 --> 17:32.333
WORLD GETS THE WORST WITH THE

17:32.400 --> 17:32.933
LEAST SUPPORT AND IT'S THE SAME

17:33.000 --> 17:35.200
KIND OF SYSTEM HERE.

17:35.266 --> 17:37.433
THE REAL ISSUE IS THE SECOND OR

17:37.500 --> 17:37.933
THIRD ORDER EFFECTS OF

17:38.000 --> 17:40.466
TECHNOLOGY ARE RUNNING FASTER

17:40.533 --> 17:41.766
THAN GOVERNANCE AND REGULATION.

17:41.833 --> 17:42.933
IT'S THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK

17:43.000 --> 17:43.466
NOW BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

17:43.533 --> 17:46.033
THERE'S GOING TO BE A MOMENT

17:46.100 --> 17:47.866
LIKE THIS, IT'S A

17:47.933 --> 17:48.533
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA MOMENT WITH

17:48.600 --> 17:51.000
THESE RELEASES.

17:51.066 --> 17:52.000

19:57.900 --> 20:00.000
BOOK, IT'S A BLUEPRINT FOR A

20:00.066 --> 20:00.200
COUP.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.300
THEY WERE GOING TO THROW OUT THE

20:02.366 --> 20:04.766
RESULTS IN SEVEN STATES, BASED

20:04.833 --> 20:06.200
ON NOTHING, THAT THERE WERE

20:06.266 --> 20:08.266
COMPETING ELECTORS, THERE

20:08.333 --> 20:08.900
WEREN'T, THEN THE CONTENTS HAVE

20:08.966 --> 20:13.633
HAD TO DECLARE THAT TRUMP WAS

20:13.700 --> 20:16.866
THE WINNER BECAUSE THERE WERE

20:16.933 --> 20:20.000
270 VOTES CAST AT ALL, HE WON TO

20:20.066 --> 20:22.166
32-222 AND THEN THEY WOULD THROW

20:22.233 --> 20:24.033
THE ELECTION TO THE HOUSE WHERE

20:24.100 --> 20:25.766
REPUBLICANS HAD CONTROL OF 26

24:00.033 --> 24:02.400
WHAT COULD HE KNOW?

24:02.466 --> 24:03.500
HE SAID THE SAME THINGS I'VE

24:03.566 --> 24:04.466
BEEN SAYING, TRUMP WILL BE THE

THIS VIRUS HAS LEARNED, THIS IS

24:20.333 --> 24:21.400
THE DELTA VARIANCE.

24:21.466 --> 24:22.366
THEY LEARNED THEIR MISTAKES,

24:22.433 --> 24:23.666
THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE BECAUSE

24:23.733 --> 24:25.000
THEY THOUGHT REPUBLICANS WILL DO

24:25.066 --> 24:26.733
OUR BIDDING OR KILL THE GUY IN

24:26.800 --> 24:28.600
GEORGIA, WOULD YOU CHANGE THE

24:28.666 --> 24:28.866

24:31.900 --> 24:33.466
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, THEY

CHANGE THE POWER STRUCTURE, IT'S

24:35.300 --> 24:36.600
WITH THE LEGISLATURE NOW, THEY

24:36.666 --> 24:39.033
CAN OVERRULE THE SECRETARIES OF

24:39.100 --> 24:40.566
STATE.

24:40.633 --> 24:42.666
WHOEVER WINS IS GOING TO BE A

24:42.733 --> 24:43.166
DISPUTED ELECTION.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.633
THERE'S GOING TO BE PROTESTS,

24:45.700 --> 24:46.900
FIGHT AND MIGHT HAVE TO CALL AT

TYRANT, THEN HE'S LINCOLN IN

24:50.500 --> 24:50.633
1860.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.500
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS

24:52.566 --> 24:54.966
WHY DEMOCRATS NEEDS TO START

24:55.033 --> 24:56.733
INVESTING IN RED, RURAL AMERICA.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.166
REPUBLICANS PLAY THE LONG GAME

24:58.233 --> 24:59.566
AND THEY ARE THE ONES INVESTING

24:59.633 --> 25:00.666
PUTTING THESE JUDGES AND PLACES

25:00.733 --> 25:02.566
AND HELPING THESE PEOPLE TO WIN

25:02.633 --> 25:03.766
THESE SEATS SPEAK OF THE

25:03.833 --> 25:06.466

25:10.066 --> 25:11.266
THEY DO NEED TO GET OFF THEIR

25:11.333 --> 25:15.566
ASS, WE'LL AGREE ON THAT.

25:15.633 --> 25:17.933
I DO FEEL BAD FOR JOE, THERE ARE

25:18.000 --> 25:18.566
TIMES WHEN YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT

25:18.633 --> 25:22.366
WHEN THAT JOB MUST JUST SUCK OUT

25:22.433 --> 25:23.666
LOUD AND SOME OF IT IS BECAUSE

25:23.733 --> 25:26.133
OF THINGS YOU DID TO MAKE IT

25:26.200 --> 25:27.200
SUCK, AFGHANISTAN, HE DID NOT

25:27.266 --> 25:33.366
STICK THE LANDING.

25:33.433 --> 25:35.233
COVID, NOT REALLY HIS FAULT BUT

25:35.300 --> 25:37.566
HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE OVER THAT

25:37.633 --> 25:38.700
ONE RIGHT NOW, HE'S HAVING A

25:38.766 --> 25:39.366
ROUGH TIME.

25:39.433 --> 25:41.933
MAY BE THE MOST DISAPPOINTING TO

25:42.000 --> 25:44.033
HIM BUT IT IS KIND OF SAD, HE

25:44.100 --> 25:45.433
THOUGHT THAT THE REPUBLICANS

25:45.500 --> 25:47.200
WOULD GO BACK, AND I WRITE?

25:47.266 --> 25:48.400
HE REALLY DID, YOU CAN SEE IT,

25:48.466 --> 25:50.566
YOU COULD HEAR IT, HE THOUGHT

25:50.633 --> 25:54.166
THE REPUBLICANS WOULD GO BACK TO

25:54.233 --> 25:56.100
BEING THE EVERETT DIRKSEN

25:56.166 --> 25:56.666
REPUBLICAN, MITCH McCONNELL

25:56.733 --> 25:57.966
WOULD STOP BEING AN ASSHOLE AND

25:58.033 --> 25:59.300
THEY WOULD HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER

25:59.366 --> 26:02.166
AND WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER.

26:02.233 --> 26:03.533
>> JENNIFER RUBIN REPUBLICANS, I

26:03.600 --> 26:05.100
LEFT BECAUSE THERE WERE NO

26:05.166 --> 26:06.166
JENNIFER RUBIN REPUBLICANS,

26:06.233 --> 26:07.066
THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL CRAZED AND

26:07.133 --> 26:09.866
MITCH McCONNELL HAS JUST

26:09.933 --> 26:12.466
DECIDED HE WOULD RATHER DRIVE

26:12.533 --> 26:16.333
THE CAR INTO THE BRICK WALL THEN

26:16.400 --> 26:18.700
THE DO HIS JOB WHICH IS TO PAY

26:18.766 --> 26:22.300
FOR WHAT HE ALREADY SPENT UNDER

26:22.366 --> 26:27.500
THE LAST PRESIDENT.

26:27.566 --> 26:30.200
THIS NOTION THAT WE NEED A

26:30.266 --> 26:31.766
FILIBUSTER BECAUSE A FILIBUSTER

26:31.833 --> 26:33.633
IS GOING TO PROMOTE DIALOGUE AND

26:33.700 --> 26:36.900
COMPROMISE AND DEBATE IS

26:36.966 --> 26:40.200
NONSENSE.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.166
GOD BLESS HIM, MANY OF THE

26:42.233 --> 26:43.633
NEVER TRUMPERS LIKE MYSELF WHO

26:43.700 --> 26:45.166
CAME OVER, WE LOOK AT THIS AND

26:45.233 --> 26:46.333
WE SAY MUST WE DO EVERYTHING?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.766
THESE GUYS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO

26:48.833 --> 26:50.633
USE POWER, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW

26:50.700 --> 26:51.833
TO WHIP THEIR OWN PEOPLE --

26:51.900 --> 26:52.833
>> Bill: HOW HAVE THEY NOT HAD

26:52.900 --> 26:56.433
HEARINGS ON THIS ALREADY?

26:56.500 --> 26:58.833
DOES IT TAKE US BEFORE TO TRY TO

26:58.900 --> 26:59.733
TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT, TO

26:59.800 --> 27:02.966
DISQUALIFY REAL VOTING?

27:03.033 --> 27:03.566
IT'S A THOUSAND TIMES MORE

27:03.633 --> 27:06.466
CONSEQUENTIAL THAN BENGHAZI.

27:06.533 --> 27:12.166
RIGHT AWAY, NEVER ENDING.

27:12.233 --> 27:14.366
>> THEY DON'T EVEN GET THAT

27:14.433 --> 27:15.100
LANGUAGE RIGHT, THESE PEOPLE ARE

27:15.166 --> 27:17.333
DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AND INSTEAD

27:17.400 --> 27:19.500
THEY USE ALL KINDS OF

27:19.566 --> 27:24.366
LANGUAGE -- RIOTERS, DISSENTERS.

27:24.433 --> 27:25.566
>> Bill: PROTESTERS!

27:25.633 --> 27:26.400
>> NO, THEY ARE TRAITORS AND

27:26.466 --> 27:29.266
THEY ARE CRIMINALS.

27:29.333 --> 27:35.000
AND THE PARTY IS BEING RUN BY

27:35.066 --> 27:38.300
PEOPLE WHO BROKE IN AND TRIED TO

27:38.366 --> 27:38.700
WRECK THE CAPITAL.

27:38.766 --> 27:40.733
>> Bill: THEY ARE TREES AND

27:40.800 --> 27:44.766
ENTHUSIASTS.

27:44.833 --> 27:46.700
EVERYTHING IS RIDING ON THIS

27:46.766 --> 27:49.700
$3.5 TRILLION BILL.

27:49.766 --> 27:51.400
VERY BAD MESSAGING, YOU BROUGHT

27:51.466 --> 27:52.966
THAT UP WITH THE DEMOCRATS

27:53.033 --> 27:56.433
BECAUSE IT'S OVER TEN YEARS.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.500
ONE NOT SAY THAT?

27:57.566 --> 27:59.800
THAT'S SUCH A SCARY NUMBER AND I

27:59.866 --> 28:03.433
HEAR PEOPLE COMPARING IT TO THE

28:03.500 --> 28:04.300
780 BILLION THAT CONGRESS VOTED

28:04.366 --> 28:06.166
IN THE 2008 RECESSION WHICH WAS

28:06.233 --> 28:08.100
THE HIGHEST WE EVER WENT AT ONE

28:08.166 --> 28:09.733
MOMENT, THEY DID NOT WANT TO

28:09.800 --> 28:12.800
MAKE IT A TRILLION BECAUSE THE T

28:12.866 --> 28:13.333
WORD WAS VERY SCARY.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.200
IF THAT WAS ALL AT ONCE, THAT

28:15.266 --> 28:18.666
WAS IN ONE FELL SWOOP, THIS IS

28:18.733 --> 28:20.766
350 BILLION, A LOT, A YEAR, BUT

28:20.833 --> 28:23.033
DOLED OUT TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT

28:23.100 --> 28:23.566
PEOPLE.

28:23.633 --> 28:25.766
IT'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT BIG

28:25.833 --> 28:26.366
PROGRAMS.

28:26.433 --> 28:27.400
MY QUESTION, THE FIRST ONE IS,

28:27.466 --> 28:29.800
WHY DO IT ALL IN THIS ONE, WHY

28:29.866 --> 28:31.600
MAKE YOU EAT THE WHOLE FUCKING

28:31.666 --> 28:34.700
REFRIGERATOR AT ONCE?

28:34.766 --> 28:36.800
IT'S LIKE IF THEY DID THE NEW

28:36.866 --> 28:38.766
DEAL, IT WAS PIECE BY PIECE, A

28:38.833 --> 28:42.100
PIECE OF LEGISLATION HERE COME A

28:42.166 --> 28:43.366
PIECE, SOCIAL SECURITY WASN'T

28:43.433 --> 28:44.333
PUT IN WITH THE TVA AND

28:44.400 --> 28:45.733
EVERYTHING ELSE, WHY ARE WE

28:45.800 --> 28:46.800
DOING IT LIKE THIS?

28:46.866 --> 28:48.966
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE

28:49.033 --> 28:50.033
LOOKING AT THIS AND THEY ARE

28:50.100 --> 28:51.566
REALIZING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

28:51.633 --> 28:53.600
AISLE, REPUBLICANS OUT IN THIS

28:53.666 --> 28:55.566
COUNTRY NEED THE SAME THINGS.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.100
THIS IS BENEFITING EVERYBODY AND

28:57.166 --> 28:59.600
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING

28:59.666 --> 29:00.600
DONE BECAUSE THEY KNOW

29:00.666 --> 29:02.600
REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT US TO GO

29:02.666 --> 29:04.800
INTO 2022 WITH ANY VICTORIES AT

29:04.866 --> 29:06.233
ALL.

29:06.300 --> 29:07.966
YOU COULD DO IT PIECE BY PIECE.

29:08.033 --> 29:10.200
>> Bill: ISN'T IT EASY -- WHY

29:10.266 --> 29:11.333
WOULD MITCH McCONNELL IF YOU

29:11.400 --> 29:12.933
CAME TO HIM AND SAID I WOULD

29:13.000 --> 29:13.833
LIKE YOU TO SIGN ON SOMETHING

29:13.900 --> 29:24.000
THAT WOULD COST ON A SHIP L SHID

29:24.066 --> 29:27.300
OF MONEY, WHAT YOU SAY?

29:27.366 --> 29:28.700
>> HE'S AGAINST ROADS AND

29:28.766 --> 29:29.966
BRIDGES FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

29:30.033 --> 29:30.966
>> Bill: IT'S HARDER WHEN

29:31.033 --> 29:33.166
YOU'RE RUNNING, IT'S MUCH EASIER

29:33.233 --> 29:35.000
TO GO HE WAS AGAINST THIS

29:35.066 --> 29:36.633
3.5 TRILLION, THAT'S TOO MUCH

29:36.700 --> 29:36.833
MONEY.

29:36.900 --> 29:41.000
HE WAS AGAINST PRESCHOOL, SMALL

29:41.066 --> 29:45.600
CHILDREN IN SCHOOL, HE HATES IT.

29:45.666 --> 29:45.966
[LAUGHTER]

29:46.033 --> 29:47.100
>> THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD STUFF IN

29:47.166 --> 29:50.900
THIS, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, EVEN

29:50.966 --> 29:52.066
THE AVERAGE INFORMED AMERICAN

29:52.133 --> 29:53.100
HAS NO IDEA BECAUSE ALL WE ARE

29:53.166 --> 29:54.200
DOING IS TALKING ABOUT THE

29:54.266 --> 29:56.000
NUMBER, THE OTHER THING WE ARE

29:56.066 --> 29:56.700
TALKING ABOUT, AMERICA IS BETTER

29:56.766 --> 29:57.900

29:57.966 --> 30:00.300
THERE, THEY LIKE TAXING THE RICH

30:00.366 --> 30:00.533

30:00.600 --> 30:04.466
THAT'S WHAT JOE BIDEN NEEDS TO

30:04.533 --> 30:06.466
TALK ABOUT, IT'S MUCH MORE

30:06.533 --> 30:07.900
POPULAR THAN CHILD CARE, PAID

30:07.966 --> 30:11.400
LEAVE, TAXING THE RICH PEOPLE.

30:11.466 --> 30:13.966
>> Bill: 3.5 TRILLION IS GOING

30:14.033 --> 30:19.233
TO BE PAID FOR BY 1.8% OF THE

30:19.300 --> 30:20.300
PEOPLE.

30:20.366 --> 30:20.833
LET'S NOT SAY -- JUST FOR

30:20.900 --> 30:22.933
HONESTY ON THIS WHICH I DON'T

30:30.266 --> 30:31.000
A DIME.

30:31.066 --> 30:32.766
YOU CAN MAKE THREE $150,000 AND

30:32.833 --> 30:35.600
YOU WANT TO PAY FOR ANY OF ITS.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.166
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I

THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

30:38.833 --> 30:43.633
WANTING -- I APPLAUD JOE BIDEN

34:48.866 --> 34:49.866
"GOT IT," OR "WHOA, THAT'S

34:49.933 --> 34:56.666
CRAZY."

34:56.733 --> 34:59.166
[LAUGHTER]

34:59.233 --> 35:04.200
[APPLAUSE]

35:04.266 --> 35:05.366
SO WE AGREED THAT JOE BIDEN

35:05.433 --> 35:07.966
WOULD BE BETTER OFF I THINK IF

35:08.033 --> 35:08.566
HE JUST UNDERSTOOD MITCH

35:08.633 --> 35:11.333
McCONNELL IS NOT THAT INTO YOU

35:11.400 --> 35:14.000
YOU.

35:14.066 --> 35:14.500
[LAUGHTER]

35:14.566 --> 35:16.933
I'M READING THESE NUMBERS ON THE

35:17.000 --> 35:19.766
DEBT -- IF THEY DO THIS, IF THEY

35:19.833 --> 35:20.933
DEFAULT, YOU DON'T THINK THEY

35:21.000 --> 35:21.366
REALLY WILL, RIGHT?

35:21.433 --> 35:24.666
THIS IS ALWAYS A THREAT.

35:24.733 --> 35:25.300
OF COURSE MITCH McCONNELL WHEN

35:25.366 --> 35:32.100
REPUBLICANS ARE IN OFFICE, THIS

35:32.166 --> 35:32.966
IDEA THAT WE ALREADY SPEND THE

35:33.033 --> 35:34.266
MONEY THEN WE VOTE WHETHER TO

35:34.333 --> 35:35.466
PAY THE CREDIT CARD BILL?

35:35.533 --> 35:38.366
>> WE DON'T NEED TO DO THIS!

35:38.433 --> 35:39.366
IT'S NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION.

35:39.433 --> 35:42.133
>> Bill: THERE'S ONLY TWO

35:42.200 --> 35:43.133
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD

35:43.200 --> 35:45.600
THAT DO IT, POLAND -- NO JOKE.

35:45.666 --> 35:49.200
AND DENMARK.

35:49.266 --> 35:51.400
>> OF COURSE DENMARK IS STILL

35:51.466 --> 35:52.500
RESPONSIBLE, THEY WILL ALWAYS

35:52.566 --> 35:53.366
PASS IT.

35:53.433 --> 35:54.566
>> Bill: WE USED TO BE

35:54.633 --> 35:54.866
DENMARK!

35:54.933 --> 35:57.033
>> THEY ALSO HAVE A COVID RATE

35:57.100 --> 35:58.900
THAT'S PRACTICALLY ZERO!

35:58.966 --> 36:01.300
IN THIS WHOLE BUDGET PROCESS, WE

36:01.366 --> 36:02.166
HAVE TWO THINGS HAPPENING AT

36:02.233 --> 36:03.966
ONCE WHICH ARE RIDICULOUS, ONE

36:04.033 --> 36:06.100
IS THE DEBT AND SECONDLY IS THE

36:06.166 --> 36:07.533
OPERATING MONEY THAT'S GOING TO

36:07.600 --> 36:08.266
CLOSE DOWN THE GOVERNMENT SO WE

36:08.333 --> 36:09.866
ARE GOING TO CRASH THE ECONOMY

36:09.933 --> 36:10.866
BECAUSE WE CAN'T PAY THAT DEBT

36:10.933 --> 36:13.600
AND WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE THE

36:13.666 --> 36:15.233
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE

36:15.300 --> 36:16.233
RIDICULOUS RULES THAT

36:16.300 --> 36:18.066
ESSENTIALLY GIVE THE MINORITY

36:18.133 --> 36:22.666
PARTY OF VITO.

36:22.733 --> 36:25.400
EXAMPLE A FOR GETTING RID OF THE

36:25.466 --> 36:25.733
FILIBUSTER.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.100
>> MY THEORY IS YOU HAVE ONE

36:28.166 --> 36:30.066
SIDED THAT WOULD ABSENTLY HAVE

36:30.133 --> 36:31.033
NO PROBLEMS WATCHING OUR NATION

36:31.100 --> 36:31.933
CRASH AS LONG AS THEY GET TO

36:32.000 --> 36:33.566
BLAME IT ON SOMEONE ELSE.

36:33.633 --> 36:34.766
>> Bill: IT'S ALL ABOUT

36:34.833 --> 36:36.366
PRESENTING THE DEMOCRATS AS BIG

36:36.433 --> 36:38.200
SPENDERS BUT IT'S MONEY WE

36:38.266 --> 36:39.566
ALREADY SPENT, MUCH OF WHICH

36:39.633 --> 36:41.233
MITCH McCONNELL VOTED FOR.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.866
A LOT OF IT IS FROM THE LAST

36:43.933 --> 36:44.500
ADMINISTRATION.

36:44.566 --> 36:47.800
OUR DEBT IS 100 -- WHAT IS IT

36:47.866 --> 36:48.700
NOW?

36:48.766 --> 36:51.533
129% OF GDP.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.833
>> LIKE $29 TRILLION.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.800
>> Bill: IT WAS 114% AFTER

36:56.866 --> 36:57.466
WORLD WAR II, THE BIGGEST CRISIS

36:57.533 --> 36:59.933
WE EVER HAD.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.966
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CAN GO ON.

37:04.033 --> 37:07.133
ALMOST 40% OF THE PEOPLE DON'T

37:07.200 --> 37:08.400
WORK, THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED

37:08.466 --> 37:11.066
THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

37:11.133 --> 37:13.033
RATE.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.000
THE PERCENTAGE OF CIVILIANS 16

37:15.066 --> 37:17.366
AND OLDER WORKING OR LOOKING FOR

37:17.433 --> 37:21.100
WORK, THAT IS 61.7%.

37:21.166 --> 37:24.266
ALMOST 40% OF PEOPLE WHO CAN WHO

37:24.333 --> 37:27.366
ARE ADULTS OR ALMOST ADULTS

37:27.433 --> 37:30.166
DON'T WORK, WHY?

37:30.233 --> 37:31.900
>> AND YET WE HAVE PEOPLE IN

37:31.966 --> 37:33.933
THIS WORLD THAT WOULD WALK

37:34.000 --> 37:34.933
THOUSANDS OF MILES TO TRY TO GET

37:35.000 --> 37:36.266
TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

37:36.333 --> 37:37.300
AND WOULD BE GLAD TO DO ANY JOB

37:37.366 --> 37:42.466
LIKE THAT.

37:42.533 --> 37:44.600
>> MAY BE WE COULD TRADE TO.

37:44.666 --> 37:46.100
>> Bill: IT'S NOT ALL LETTUCE

37:46.166 --> 37:47.433
PICKING JOBS, I THINK THERE ARE

37:47.500 --> 37:49.400
TWO BIG THINGS IN HERE.

37:49.466 --> 37:50.333
I THINK A LOT OF THAT 40% WHO

37:50.400 --> 37:52.666
DON'T WORK ARE SICK.

37:52.733 --> 37:57.733
BUT WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE ROOT

37:57.800 --> 37:58.366
CAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM, I'VE BEEN

37:58.433 --> 38:00.000
SAYING THIS FOR 28 YEARS, WHY

38:00.066 --> 38:01.433
ARE PEOPLE SO SICK IN THIS

38:01.500 --> 38:01.933
COUNTRY?

38:02.000 --> 38:02.733
WE NEVER ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE

38:02.800 --> 38:07.066
OF THAT.

38:07.133 --> 38:08.200
THE OTHER THING HERE IS

38:08.266 --> 38:08.933
INHERITED WEALTH, THERE'S TOO

38:09.000 --> 38:10.733
MUCH INHERITED WEALTH.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.533
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN

38:14.600 --> 38:18.333
JUST LIVE OFF MOMMY AND DADDY.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.333
>> THIS IS GOING TO BRING OUT MY

38:20.400 --> 38:20.700
INNER COMMUNIST.

38:20.766 --> 38:24.200
[APPLAUSE]

38:24.266 --> 38:25.733
A FEW MILLION DOLLARS, YOU'VE

38:25.800 --> 38:26.933
MADE A FORTUNE, YOU WANT TO PASS

38:27.000 --> 38:29.800
A FEW MILLION TO YOUR KIDS,

38:29.866 --> 38:30.100
THAT'S FINE.

38:30.166 --> 38:31.533
BEYOND THAT, WHY SHOULD ANYBODY

38:31.600 --> 38:33.833
BE ABLE TO PASS ON THIS

38:33.900 --> 38:34.600
INHERITED WEALTH?

38:34.666 --> 38:37.333
THIS IS A HUGE POT OF MONEY

38:37.400 --> 38:39.266
BETWEEN THIS AND THE ACCRETION

38:39.333 --> 38:42.233
OF WEALTH IN THE STOCK MARKET,

38:42.300 --> 38:43.300
TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS THAT

38:43.366 --> 38:44.066
COULD BE USED FOR REALLY GOOD

38:44.133 --> 38:45.933
THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN

38:46.000 --> 38:46.100
USE.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.266
>> THE PROBLEM IS, THE FILTHY,

38:48.333 --> 38:51.300
FILTHY RICH IN THIS COUNTRY CAN

38:51.366 --> 38:53.466
PAY FOR LOBBYISTS TO GREASE THE

38:53.533 --> 38:54.666
POCKETS OF OUR LEGISLATORS TO

38:54.733 --> 38:55.566
MAKE SURE THEY ARE PROTECTED

38:55.633 --> 38:57.600
WHILE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN

38:57.666 --> 38:58.566
THE WORKING CLASS HAVE

38:58.633 --> 39:01.300
EVERYTHING STUCK ON THEIR

39:01.366 --> 39:03.833
FREAKING CHILDREN.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.133
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

39:06.200 --> 39:07.733
>> DEMOCRATS DON'T EXPLOIT THIS

39:07.800 --> 39:09.666
WELL ENOUGH, THERE ARE 55

39:09.733 --> 39:13.933
CORPORATIONS THAT PAY ZERO TAX.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.033
EVEN LIVING IN A FREE MARKET,

39:16.100 --> 39:16.833
IT'S RIDICULOUS AND DEMOCRATS

39:16.900 --> 39:17.466
HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT HOW TO SAY

39:17.533 --> 39:19.533
MITCH McCONNELL WANTS

39:19.600 --> 39:20.833
CORPORATIONS TO PAY NO TAXES.

39:20.900 --> 39:21.933
>> Bill: THEY SHOULD DO THAT,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.900
THEY SHOULD ALSO ONCE IN A

39:23.966 --> 39:24.766
WHILE, ONCE IN A WHILE REMIND

39:24.833 --> 39:28.366
PEOPLE THAT THEY LIKE WORK.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.133
I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE KIND OF

39:30.200 --> 39:32.166
GETTING THE REP OF THE PARTY

39:32.233 --> 39:32.833
THAT JUST WANTS TO GIVE OUT FREE

39:32.900 --> 39:35.133
MONEY.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.400
>> THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD

39:37.466 --> 39:39.733
ARGUMENT IN THAT $3.5 TRILLION,

39:39.800 --> 39:40.866
A LOT OF THESE THINGS HELP

39:40.933 --> 39:41.333
PEOPLE WORK.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.000
IF YOU HAVE CHILD CARE, YOU CAN

39:44.066 --> 39:45.600
GO WORK, IF YOU HAVE LEAVE AND

39:45.666 --> 39:48.066
CAN GET SICK, YOU GO BACK TO

39:48.133 --> 39:48.966
WORK WHEN YOU'RE HEALTHY.

39:49.033 --> 39:51.100
YOU'RE RIGHT AND THAT'S ONE OF

39:51.166 --> 39:51.766
THE THINGS THEY SHOULD BE USING

39:51.833 --> 39:54.300
TO SELL THIS PACKAGE, A LOT OF

39:54.366 --> 39:55.500
PEOPLE REALIZE THE NEED FOR

39:55.566 --> 39:56.400
CHILD CARE DURING COVID BECAUSE

39:56.466 --> 39:57.400
I'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF MY KID,

39:57.466 --> 39:59.866
I CAN'T WORK.

39:59.933 --> 40:01.366
THESE ARE PRO WORK THINGS IF

40:01.433 --> 40:02.033
THEY WOULD PACKAGE THAT AND

40:02.100 --> 40:04.966
EXPLAIN IT.

40:05.033 --> 40:06.700
>> FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO

40:06.766 --> 40:08.800
ELEVATE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY.

40:08.866 --> 40:11.500
>> Bill: TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

40:11.566 --> 40:12.933
IMMIGRANTS, I DID AN EDITORIAL A

40:13.000 --> 40:14.900
COUPLE WEEKS AGO, IT WAS

40:14.966 --> 40:15.400
ESTABLISHED BY THE USUAL

40:15.466 --> 40:17.533
SUSPECTS BUT I WAS JUST SAYING

40:17.600 --> 40:18.100
WE WERE GETTING OUT OF

40:18.166 --> 40:19.933
AFGHANISTAN AND I WAS JUST

40:20.000 --> 40:22.900
SAYING IMMIGRANTS HAVE SUCH A

40:22.966 --> 40:23.966
BETTER ATTITUDE ABOUT AMERICA

40:24.033 --> 40:27.333
THEM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE FOR

40:27.400 --> 40:27.633
A LONG TIME.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.800
THEY JUST APPRECIATE IT AND I

40:30.866 --> 40:32.833
READ THIS STORY, FRONT PAGE OF

40:32.900 --> 40:34.733
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" TODAY ABOUT

40:34.800 --> 40:38.966
VOCALTHE TERRORIST GROUP IN NIGA

40:39.033 --> 40:39.966
HAS BEEN SAVAGING THE

40:40.033 --> 40:41.366
COUNTRYSIDE FOR DECADES,

40:41.433 --> 40:42.900
CAPTURING WHOLE VILLAGES AND

40:42.966 --> 40:44.533
GIRLS INTO SLAVERY --

40:44.600 --> 40:45.300
EX-FIGHTERS NOW LIVING NEXT DOOR

40:45.366 --> 40:48.366
TO PEOPLE THEY MENACED.

40:48.433 --> 40:53.266
IF YOU THINK AMERICA'S BAD, TRY

40:53.333 --> 40:59.333
HAVING BOKO HARAM MOVE IN NEXT

40:59.400 --> 40:59.566
DOOR.

40:59.633 --> 41:01.033
HERE'S A THOUGHT I NEVER THOUGHT

41:01.100 --> 41:03.366
I WOULD HAVE TO BE CONFRONTING,

41:03.433 --> 41:04.333
BITE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

41:04.400 --> 41:10.966
SAYING IS TOO MINAJY IN FOREIGN

41:11.033 --> 41:11.400
AFFAIRS.

41:11.466 --> 41:12.733
THE FIRST WANT TO TALK ABOUT

41:12.800 --> 41:15.100
THIS, FAREED ZAKARIA -- BIDEN

41:15.166 --> 41:22.566
WAS AT THE U.N. THIS WEEK,

41:22.633 --> 41:23.500
FRANCE IS MAD AT US AND IS

41:23.566 --> 41:26.733
ALREADY COMPARED HIM TO TRUMP

41:26.800 --> 41:29.000
BUT HERE IS FAREED ZAKARIA, A

41:29.066 --> 41:31.500
SENIOR DIPLOMAT NOTICED IN

41:31.566 --> 41:32.033
DEALINGS WITH WASHINGTON,

41:32.100 --> 41:35.366
EVERYTHING FROM VACCINES TO

41:35.433 --> 41:37.133
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, THE BIDEN

41:37.200 --> 41:38.266
POLICIES ARE AMERICA FIRST

41:38.333 --> 41:40.666
FIGURE HE MIGHT NOT CALL IT

41:40.733 --> 41:42.500
THAT, HIS BUY AMERICA PLANS ARE

41:42.566 --> 41:46.966
MORE PROTECTIONIST THAN TRUMPS,

41:47.033 --> 41:50.966
WE DIDN'T RE-UP ON THE

41:51.033 --> 41:52.100
TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, WE

41:52.166 --> 41:53.733
DIDN'T GO BACK TO THE IRAN DEAL,

41:53.800 --> 41:55.933
CUBA IS WHERE IT WAS, HE

41:56.000 --> 41:58.133
COULD'VE GONE BACK TO OBAMA'S

41:58.200 --> 41:58.566
POLICY.

41:58.633 --> 41:59.800
SENDING THE HAITIANS BACK TO A

41:59.866 --> 42:00.800
COUNTRY THAT ISN'T THEIRS

42:00.866 --> 42:07.400
ANYMORE, IT DOES SEEM MORE TRUM

42:07.466 --> 42:09.800
TRUMPY THEN BIDENY.

42:09.866 --> 42:13.900
>> I'LL TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW.

42:13.966 --> 42:17.800
BIDEN CLEARLY DOES THINGS TRUMP

42:17.866 --> 42:22.533
WOULD NEVER DO, WE JOINED THE

42:22.600 --> 42:23.133
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, WE

42:23.200 --> 42:26.133
REJOIN THE PARIS ACCORDS.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.633
WE ARE TRYING TO REJOIN THE IRAN

42:28.700 --> 42:31.933
DEAL, IT WASN'T BIDEN WHO PULLED

42:32.000 --> 42:32.366
OUT.

42:32.433 --> 42:33.900
I THINK THE ONE POINT THAT HE

42:33.966 --> 42:36.000
HAS A GOOD POINT ABOUT WHICH HAS

42:36.066 --> 42:39.300
BOTHERED ME FOR A WHILE IS BOTH

42:39.366 --> 42:40.400
PARTIES ARE PROTECTIONIST.

42:40.466 --> 42:43.700
THIS IS THE STUPIDEST POLICY,

42:43.766 --> 42:45.633
FOR CONSUMPTION BACK HOME.

42:45.700 --> 42:48.333
TRADE IS GOOD, IT'S NOT

42:48.400 --> 42:51.100
ZERO-SUM, WE GET RICH, THEY GET

42:51.166 --> 42:52.733
RICH AND BOTH PARTIES, IT WAS

42:52.800 --> 42:53.933
UNDER OBAMA THEY COULDN'T PUSH

42:54.000 --> 42:56.233
IT THROUGH TPP SO IT NEVER

42:56.300 --> 42:56.933
HAPPENED.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.100
THIS IS THE BEST ANTI-CHINA BILL

42:58.166 --> 43:00.233
WE HAVE EVER COME UP WITH, IT

43:00.300 --> 43:03.133
BRINGS IN OUR ALLIES, IT HELPS

43:03.200 --> 43:05.233
US TRADE AND IN BOTH PARTIES

43:05.300 --> 43:06.200
HAVE GOTTEN VERY SHORTSIGHTED

43:06.266 --> 43:07.800
AND THEY EXPLOITED IT BECAUSE

43:07.866 --> 43:08.933
THEY ARE SAYING YOU'RE SENDING

43:09.000 --> 43:12.600
JOBS OVERSEAS WHICH IS NOT THE

43:12.666 --> 43:12.800
CASE.

43:12.866 --> 43:15.133
THAT IS SOMETHING I AM SURPRISED

43:15.200 --> 43:16.166
BIDEN DIDN'T TAKE ON HEAD-ON, IT

43:16.233 --> 43:19.266
COULD BE A WINNER.

43:19.333 --> 43:20.533
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY

43:20.600 --> 43:25.766
WHERE THE MARKET IS EXPORTING,

43:25.833 --> 43:27.433
WE HAVE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

43:27.500 --> 43:30.133
THE POPULATION, YOU HAVE TO BE

43:30.200 --> 43:30.666
ABLE TO EXPORT.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.100
>> Bill: SOMETIMES IS NOT BAD

43:32.166 --> 43:33.733
TO BE AMERICA FIRST, I DON'T

43:33.800 --> 43:34.766
UNDERSTAND WHY FRANCE -- I

43:34.833 --> 43:36.166
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE MAD AT

43:36.233 --> 43:38.566
US BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

43:38.633 --> 43:41.166
HAPPENED, FRANCE HAD A DEAL TO

43:41.233 --> 43:42.833
SELL NUCLEAR SUBMARINES FOR

43:42.900 --> 43:43.666
DEFENSE TO AUSTRALIA.

43:43.733 --> 43:44.666
AT THE LAST MINUTE, WE CAME IN

43:44.733 --> 43:49.033
AND OFFERED THEM CHEAPER AND

43:49.100 --> 43:51.400
BETTER AND THEY TOOK IT.

43:51.466 --> 43:54.266
THAT'S THE ART OF THE DEAL,

43:54.333 --> 43:56.466
BITCH!

43:56.533 --> 43:58.566
SORRY, WE BEAT YOU AT BUSINESS

43:58.633 --> 44:00.333
FAIR AND SQUARE, WE DIDN'T HOLD

44:00.400 --> 44:01.833
A GUN TO AUSTRALIA'S HEAD!

44:01.900 --> 44:03.933
>> ABSOLUTELY AND IF FRANCE

44:04.000 --> 44:05.333
WANTS TO SELL THEIR STUFF, I'M

44:05.400 --> 44:06.966
SURE SAUDI ARABIA WOULD BUY IT,

44:07.033 --> 44:08.733
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, OUR

44:08.800 --> 44:10.166
STUFF IS SUPERIOR SO AUSTRALIA

44:10.233 --> 44:11.233
WILL GO WITH THAT.

44:11.300 --> 44:12.800
>> Bill: ONE THING WE CAN

44:12.866 --> 44:14.866
STILL DO IS MAKE KILLING

44:14.933 --> 44:15.133
MACHINES.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.900
>> IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO CHINA

44:16.966 --> 44:18.333
TO LET THEM KNOW, WE ARE IN

44:18.400 --> 44:19.533
THEIR NECK OF THE WOODS.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.733
>> Bill: WE SHOULDN'T FEEL BAD

44:21.800 --> 44:25.333
ABOUT THAT ONE, RIGHT?

44:25.400 --> 44:26.866
>> THE FRENCH SHIPS WERE SO BAD,

44:26.933 --> 44:29.933
THEY WERE REALLY LOUD.

44:30.033 --> 44:32.933
>> OURS IS NUCLEAR, THERE IS IS

44:33.000 --> 44:33.166
DIESEL.

44:33.233 --> 44:34.366
>> Bill: SERIOUSLY?

44:34.433 --> 44:38.933
I FEEL EVEN BETTER ABOUT IT NOW.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.533
>> NOT IS A GOOD IDEA IF YOU'RE

44:42.600 --> 44:43.133
TRYING TO SPY.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.466
>> Bill: YOU SEE THAT BLACK

44:45.533 --> 44:45.666
SMOKE?

44:45.733 --> 44:48.600
IT DIDN'T HAVE TRUCK NUTS ON IT,

44:48.666 --> 44:51.166
DID IT?

44:51.233 --> 44:53.466
>> THEY CAN SPY, THEY CAN DO

44:53.533 --> 44:54.233
PRODUCTIVE THINGS, OF COURSE THE

44:54.300 --> 44:59.000
FRENCH HAD A HISSY FIT AND LEFT.

44:59.066 --> 45:02.833
>> Bill: HOURS CAN KILL THE

45:02.900 --> 45:07.933
WHALES SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.466
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOU ARE

45:09.533 --> 45:09.733

[LAUGHTER]

46:27.900 --> 46:28.066
[APPLAUSE]

46:28.133 --> 46:29.400
NEW RULE: SOMEONE HAS TO TELL

46:29.466 --> 46:30.966

46:31.033 --> 46:32.000
WHEN YOU TELL ME "INTUIT NEARS

46:33.533 --> 46:35.333
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

46:35.400 --> 46:41.966
ABOUT.

46:42.033 --> 46:42.233
[LAUGHTER]

46:42.300 --> 46:43.366
[APPLAUSE]

46:43.433 --> 46:45.000
BUT IF THAT MONKEY WINKING AT ME

46:45.066 --> 46:51.300

46:51.366 --> 46:59.333

47:03.900 --> 47:04.566
ARTISTS THAT WRAPPING THINGS IN

47:04.633 --> 47:05.266
FABRIC ISN'T ART.

47:05.333 --> 47:06.100
AND OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE COVERING

47:06.166 --> 47:07.000
IS ART.

47:07.066 --> 47:08.333
YOU'RE NOT SO MUCH "CREATING" AS

47:08.400 --> 47:13.133
YOU ARE "REUPHOLSTERING."

47:36.566 --> 47:39.866
AUDIENCE.

47:39.933 --> 47:40.900
"OH, BILL.

47:40.966 --> 47:42.966

47:43.033 --> 47:51.466

47:51.800 --> 47:52.000
[APPLAUSE]

47:52.066 --> 47:52.700
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

47:52.766 --> 47:53.733
THE ONLY TIME THERE SHOULD BE

47:53.800 --> 47:54.766
TWO NATIONAL ANTHEMS IS WHEN THE

47:54.833 --> 47:58.566
OTHER TEAM IS FROM CANADA.

47:58.633 --> 47:59.200
THIS SEASON, THE NFL HAS ADDED

47:59.266 --> 47:59.466

47:59.533 --> 47:59.733

47:59.800 --> 48:00.500
LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING,

48:00.566 --> 48:01.333
COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK

48:01.400 --> 48:02.366
NATIONAL ANTHEM, TO THE

48:02.433 --> 48:03.600
STAR-SPANGLED BANNER BEFORE

48:03.666 --> 48:04.566
GAMES, AND TWO WEEKS AGO I

48:04.633 --> 48:05.466
OPINED THAT IT WAS FINE TO GET

48:05.533 --> 48:06.633
RID OF THE OLD ANTHEM, WE JUST

48:06.700 --> 48:07.966
SHOULDN'T HAVE TWO.

48:08.033 --> 48:09.133
IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW FOR

48:09.200 --> 48:10.666
OPINIONS, AND YOU WANT TO KNOW

48:10.733 --> 48:11.633
WHAT THE CORRECT OPINION ON THE

48:11.700 --> 48:17.833
ANTHEM IS -- THAT'S IT.

48:17.900 --> 48:18.100
[LAUGHTER]

48:18.166 --> 48:19.900
THAT'S THE CORRECT ONE.

48:19.966 --> 48:20.366
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TWO.

48:20.433 --> 48:21.633
[APPLAUSE]

48:21.700 --> 48:24.100
THE VIEW LAST WEEK DEVOTED A LOT

48:24.166 --> 48:25.433
OF TIME TO THIS WHILE SOMEHOW

48:25.500 --> 48:27.866
AVOIDING WHAT I ACTUALLY SAID --

48:27.933 --> 48:29.266
IT SEEMED TO BE A LOT ABOUT A

48:29.333 --> 48:30.800
NEED TO "SCHOOL" ME ON THE BLACK

48:30.866 --> 48:33.166
NATIONAL ANTHEM ITSELF.

48:33.233 --> 48:34.766
WHOOPI GOLDBERG SAID WE NEED TWO

48:34.833 --> 48:35.700
ANTHEMS BECAUSE "WE'RE HAVING TO

48:35.766 --> 48:37.966
RE-EDUCATE PEOPLE."

48:38.033 --> 48:39.266
BECAUSE NOTHING EVER GOES WRONG

48:39.333 --> 48:39.833
WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT

48:39.900 --> 48:47.966
"REEDUCATION."

48:48.033 --> 48:48.233
[LAUGHTER]

48:48.300 --> 48:48.766
[APPLAUSE]

48:48.833 --> 48:51.300
JUST ASK CHAIRMAN MAO.

48:51.366 --> 48:52.000
MAYBE WE CAN SET UP SOME SORT OF

48:52.066 --> 48:56.466
CAMPS.

48:56.533 --> 48:57.866
NOW, I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD

48:57.933 --> 48:59.400
ENFORCE PATRIOTISM BY SINGING

48:59.466 --> 49:01.000
ANYTHING.

49:01.066 --> 49:03.000
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING I HATE

49:03.066 --> 49:03.566
MORE THAN GROUP THINK, IT'S

49:03.633 --> 49:10.133
AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION.

49:10.200 --> 49:10.400
[LAUGHTER]

49:10.466 --> 49:11.033
BUT I AM WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL AN

49:11.100 --> 49:11.900
OLD-SCHOOL LIBERAL WHO WAS

49:11.966 --> 49:12.766
BROUGHT UP WITH THE CRAZY IDEA

49:12.833 --> 49:15.000
THAT SEGREGATING BY RACE IS BAD.

49:15.066 --> 49:22.733
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.466
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

49:24.533 --> 49:25.633
AGAIN, WHEN IT COMES TO AN

49:25.700 --> 49:27.333
ANTHEM, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

49:27.400 --> 49:28.300
THE ONE WE CURRENTLY USE, BUT IT

49:28.366 --> 49:30.033
HAS TO BE JUST ONE.

49:30.100 --> 49:31.066
YOU KNOW, CUZ IT'S A NATIONAL

49:31.133 --> 49:38.966
ANTHEM.

49:39.033 --> 49:41.000
AND SYMBOLS OF UNITY MATTER.

49:41.066 --> 49:42.433
AND PURPOSEFULLY FRAGMENTING

49:42.500 --> 49:45.433
THINGS BY RACE REINFORCES A

49:45.500 --> 49:47.133
TERRIBLE MESSAGE -- THAT WE ARE

49:47.200 --> 49:47.900
TWO NATIONS, HOPELESSLY DRIFTING

49:47.966 --> 49:50.333
APART FROM EACH OTHER.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.500
THAT'S NOT WHERE WE WERE EVEN

49:52.566 --> 49:54.366
TEN YEARS AGO, AND IT'S NOT

49:54.433 --> 50:00.266
WHERE WE SHOULD BE NOW.

50:00.333 --> 50:04.666
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:04.733 --> 50:07.300
WHERE WE SHOULD BE NOW IS HERE.

50:07.366 --> 50:08.466
>> THERE'S NOT A BLACK AMERICA

50:08.533 --> 50:09.733
AND WHITE AMERICA AND LATINO

50:09.800 --> 50:10.966
AMERICA AND ASIAN AMERICA;

50:11.033 --> 50:15.666
THERE'S THE UNITED STATES OF

50:15.733 --> 50:20.900
AMERICA.

50:20.966 --> 50:21.500
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:25.600 --> 50:26.400
TIMOTHY ASKEW, A PROFESSOR AT

50:26.466 --> 50:27.966
CLARK ATLANTA UNIVERSITY, WROTE

50:28.033 --> 50:30.166
AN ENTIRE BOOK ABOUT "LIFT EVERY

50:30.233 --> 50:31.633
VOICE AND SING," AND HE SAID "TO

50:31.700 --> 50:33.500
SING THE "BLACK NATIONAL ANTHEM'

50:33.566 --> 50:35.033
SUGGESTS THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE

50:35.100 --> 50:35.933
SEPARATIST AND WANT TO HAVE

50:36.000 --> 50:37.600
THEIR OWN NATION.

50:37.666 --> 50:38.833
THIS MEANS THAT EVERYTHING

50:38.900 --> 50:40.033
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.

50:40.100 --> 50:41.466
BELIEVED ABOUT BEING ONE NATION

50:41.533 --> 50:44.200
GETS THROWN OUT THE WINDOW."

50:44.266 --> 50:45.500
THANKS, PROFESSOR.

50:45.566 --> 50:52.633
YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM WHOOPI.

[LAUGHTER]

50:52.966 --> 50:53.166
[APPLAUSE]

50:53.233 --> 50:54.166
BUT HE'S RIGHT -- IF WE HAVE TWO

50:54.233 --> 50:54.866
ANTHEMS, WHY NOT THREE?

50:54.933 --> 50:56.100
OR FIVE?

50:56.166 --> 50:57.733
WHY NOT A WOMEN'S ANTHEM, A

50:57.800 --> 50:59.500
LATINO ANTHEM, A GAY, TRANS,

50:59.566 --> 51:00.900
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S AND ASIAN

51:00.966 --> 51:05.566
PACIFIC ISLANDER ANTHEM?

51:05.633 --> 51:06.766
BECAUSE "I'M NOT DEALING WITH

51:06.833 --> 51:08.200
YOU, I'M NOT SPEAKING TO YOU" IS

51:08.266 --> 51:09.700
NOT A WAY YOU CAN RUN A COUNTRY

51:09.766 --> 51:10.800
AND MOST PEOPLE OF ALL

51:10.866 --> 51:12.033
BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND THAT AND

51:12.100 --> 51:13.333
DON'T EVEN WANT TO TRY IT THAT

51:13.400 --> 51:15.733
WAY.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.600
I'M NOT OUT OF STEP -- BELIEVING

51:17.666 --> 51:19.100
IN "SEPARATE BUT EQUAL": THAT'S

51:19.166 --> 51:28.700
OUT OF STEP, BY 67 YEARS.

51:28.766 --> 51:31.466
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

51:31.533 --> 51:34.333
IT WAS 1954 WHEN THE SUPREME

51:40.200 --> 51:42.166

51:42.233 --> 51:44.466
WHAT WE DO HERE.

51:44.533 --> 51:46.066
WE DECIDED WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO

51:46.133 --> 51:47.366
MAKE THIS WORK.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

52:26.900 --> 52:27.533
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF

52:27.600 --> 52:28.733
GOING OFF TO COLLEGE WAS TO BE

52:28.800 --> 52:31.133
EXPOSED TO PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT

52:31.200 --> 52:32.133
BACKGROUNDS, WHO MAY NOT SHARE

52:32.200 --> 52:33.833
ALL YOUR OPINIONS, BUT YOU FIND

52:33.900 --> 52:39.666
A WAY TO GET HIGH WITH THEM.

DIVERSITY AS OUR STRENGTH, BUT

52:48.366 --> 52:49.366
NOW HALF THE KIDS' DORM ROOMS

52:49.433 --> 52:51.600
ARE DETERMINED BY RACIAL PURITY?

52:51.666 --> 52:52.833
THE UNIVERSITY OF

52:52.900 --> 52:54.133
MICHIGAN-DEARBORN THOUGHT IT

52:54.200 --> 52:55.766
WOULD BE SUPER PROGRESSIVE TO

52:55.833 --> 52:58.266
SET UP ONE VIRTUAL CAFÉ FOR

52:58.333 --> 52:59.533
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND A SEPARATE

53:15.000 --> 53:17.266
A GYM FOR MINORITIES ONLY.

53:17.333 --> 53:18.666
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING

53:18.733 --> 53:20.766
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

53:20.833 --> 53:22.866
AFRICAN-AMERICANS CARE.

53:22.933 --> 53:23.933
THAT IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS

53:24.033 --> 53:25.466
THEY'RE SAYING, "OOOH, I JUST

53:25.533 --> 53:26.266
CAN'T STAND DOING SQUATS IN

53:26.333 --> 53:29.800
FRONT OF WHITE PEOPLE!"

53:29.866 --> 53:30.966
REALLY -- WE CAN'T EVEN GO TO

53:31.033 --> 53:33.100
THE GYM TOGETHER?

53:33.166 --> 53:34.433
BECAUSE WHAT'S NEXT?

53:34.500 --> 53:35.800
WHAT FOLLOWS SEPARATE DORMS,

53:35.866 --> 53:36.866
ANTHEMS, CEREMONIES, CAFES AND

53:36.933 --> 53:38.533
GYMS.

53:38.600 --> 53:39.733
SEPARATE NEIGHBORHOODS?

53:39.800 --> 53:41.833
THAT WAS REDLINING.

53:41.900 --> 53:43.133
THEY WOULDN'T LET BLACKS LIVE IN

53:43.200 --> 53:44.633
THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP.

53:44.700 --> 53:45.900
THEN THEY DID.

53:45.966 --> 53:47.833
THE WORD FOR THAT IS PROGRESS.

53:47.900 --> 53:48.733
IT'S WHERE THE TERM

53:48.800 --> 53:59.966
"PROGRESSIVE" COMES FROM.

54:02.866 --> 54:04.000

TO BE BEHIND THE IDEA THAT YOU

54:09.100 --> 54:10.366
CAN'T HAVE A MELTING POT WITH

ORIGINAL SIN OF SLAVERY, AND

54:22.633 --> 54:24.066
REDRESS FOR THAT IS CERTAINLY

54:24.133 --> 54:25.700
STILL IN ORDER -- BUT NOT AT THE

54:25.766 --> 54:28.733
COST OF DESTROYING A COUNTRY

FOUND A DECENT LIFE IN, WITH A
