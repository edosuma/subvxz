WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.305
I serve as an equalizer.
I'm the one

00:04.438 --> 00:05.339
you call when
you can't call 911.

00:05.473 --> 00:06.607
Cuff me now. Do it.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.342
Previously on The Equalizer...

00:08.476 --> 00:10.010
Was it really about
the family, Pop?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.612
Or was it just about you?

00:11.745 --> 00:12.746
BENJAMIN: The system was
getting in the way

00:12.846 --> 00:13.814
of us getting justice,

00:13.947 --> 00:15.349
so I did what I needed to do.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.585
Ah!
You don't have to be
so tough, you know.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.120
I'm not scared of nothin'.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.355
Prove it. Because
part of being brave

00:21.489 --> 00:23.424
is making hard choices
to change your life.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.758
I can't do this.
Excuse me.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.294
Are you Kisha Griffin?

00:26.427 --> 00:27.861
ROBYN:
You said you never had someone

00:27.995 --> 00:29.963
who believed in you.
Well, now you do.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.766
f you ever need help, call me.I

00:32.866 --> 00:34.268
I'm ready.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.189
Don't even think about it.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.057
Danny Min.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.462
Neighbors don't steal.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.199
They give.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.734
Yes?

01:07.735 --> 01:10.704
Now go before I bake you
into an egg tart.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.306
(children giggle)

01:15.476 --> 01:17.145
(groans softly)

01:20.047 --> 01:21.715
MAN:
Psst.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.160
Leave me alone.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.166
Whoo! Best day
of the year right here.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.367
Is that right?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.169
Ah, I can already
smell it:

01:41.269 --> 01:42.936
the ragout simmering,

01:43.070 --> 01:45.539
ooh-- that duck
all crisp and golden.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.042
Damn. Cassoulet day.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.878
I'm so glad that
your memory's sharp, because

01:51.011 --> 01:53.914
that's the only way you're
gonna be experiencing it today.

01:54.047 --> 01:57.185
Wait... Where's Delilah?

01:57.285 --> 01:58.686
I thought she was
supposed to be helping you.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.588
She was.
She got a better offer.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.122
What're you talking about?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.791
You two have been planning this
for a week.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.193
And then a friend
of hers called,

02:05.293 --> 02:06.360
asked if she wanted
to go shopping.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.230
Dee wanted to go, so I let her.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.764
Oh, hell no.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.433
She needs to get
her butt back here.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.735
You don't just bail on family.
You know the reason

02:14.868 --> 02:17.605
I only make this recipe once
a year is because it is hard.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.940
It takes hours.
And the only thing

02:20.073 --> 02:22.943
worse than being stood up
is being stuck in a hot kitchen

02:23.076 --> 02:24.978
all day with a sullen teenager

02:25.112 --> 02:26.880
who can't take her eyes
off her phone.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.649
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
she needs to be up in her room

02:28.782 --> 02:30.050
all day without a phone.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.719
Promise me you're not
gonna punish her.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.920
I don't want that to
be the reason

02:33.053 --> 02:33.921
that she does this with me.

02:34.054 --> 02:34.955
But I...

02:35.088 --> 02:36.624
Robyn, no.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.626
This recipe is
special to me.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.495
It's part of our family.

02:41.629 --> 02:45.098
(sighs) If Dee wants to
spend the day buying shoes,

02:45.233 --> 02:49.002
then... so be it.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.609
(phone rings)

02:58.812 --> 03:00.180
Hey.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.283
CHLOE:
She called me her
"constant noise."

03:02.416 --> 03:03.751
Never tried to quiet me down,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.286
even though I was
a total delinquent.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.455
Ms. Li didn't
have any children,

03:07.588 --> 03:09.823
so every kid in Chinatown
became her surrogate child.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.659
Eight Treasure Bakery
was our community center.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.160
Eight Treasure?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.995
Is that the place
with the amazing moon cakes?

03:15.128 --> 03:17.765
This is her second location.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.534
She opened the first in '71,
at the heart of Chinatown,

03:20.668 --> 03:22.102
right after emigrating
to New York City.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.538
The new location was
an overnight hit.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.375
Until four days ago, when
someone burned it to the ground.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.778
With Ms. Li inside.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.715
Fire department said
it was electrical.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.184
Autopsy showed she died
of smoke inhalation.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.052
The cops wrote it off
as an accident.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.721
But you don't believe them.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.490
In the last few years,

03:42.623 --> 03:44.358
the attacks
on the Asian community...

03:44.492 --> 03:45.826
You think it was a hate crime?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.829
I'm sure it is.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.199
It started with reviews,
on her Yelp page.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.502
Not just hateful and vile.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.169
Some felt like threats.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.171
A week and a half ago,
I found her

03:58.306 --> 04:00.207
scrubbing spray paint
off her walls.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.843
Someone had kicked in the door
and vandalized the inside.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.645
She wouldn't tell me much
about it, but...

04:04.745 --> 04:05.913
You think she was targeted.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.651
I started walking Ms. Li to
and from work every single day.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.886
The one night that she
convinced me not to pick her up

04:13.020 --> 04:14.888
because she was working
late and alone,

04:15.022 --> 04:17.491
an "accidental" electrical fire
kills her.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.092
It can't be a coincidence.

04:19.226 --> 04:23.397
Look, I have evidence.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.099
I went back to the bakery after
the fire department left.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.101
I found this outside
by the back door.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.339
Ms. Li swept up every
single night after closing.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.575
The cops weren't interested.
But I'm hoping you are.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.579
I'll never forgive myself
for abandoning her that night.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.382
And I won't abandon her now.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.253
MEL: Yep, this has
all the greatest hits.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.521
"Go back to your country,"

04:47.621 --> 04:49.623
"stop eating dog,"
"stick to math."

04:49.757 --> 04:51.392
You'd think they'd have gotten
a little bit more creative

04:51.525 --> 04:53.093
since I was a kid.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.595
Thing is, up until
a couple of months ago,

04:54.728 --> 04:56.797
this was a solid
five-star establishment.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.899
I mean, these reviews didn't
just, like, trickle in.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.067
They hit all at once.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.902
Ms. Li made some enemies.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.237
Yeah, and so did the woman who
was beaten in Times Square.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.974
And the women who was stabbed
at a bus stop in San Francisco.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.542
And the victims of the
Atlanta spa shootings.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.910
They were innocent.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.379
Didn't do a damn thing
to deserve it.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.747
See, this is why I do not
let my grandmother

05:13.881 --> 05:15.483
leave her apartment without me.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.718
It's true. She's like
an octogenarian Rapunzel.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.252
But if Ms. Li
was being targeted,

05:19.387 --> 05:21.088
why didn't she open up to Chloe?

05:21.221 --> 05:22.656
Maybe she decided to take it
into her own hands.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.792
Check this out.
She recently subscribed

05:24.925 --> 05:26.827
to a security camera system.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.928
Which means there
should be footage

05:28.061 --> 05:29.329
from the night of the fire.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.831
Yeah, it's all uploaded
to the cloud.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.600
All right, I got it.
This was the last one

05:32.733 --> 05:34.001
recorded the night she died.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.769
Half an hour before
the fire started.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.572
(knocking)

05:43.577 --> 05:46.480
Frank. Too good
for business hours?

05:46.614 --> 05:48.749
Must be one of her regulars.
FRANK:
I had to work late tonight.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.585
Thanks for this, Ms. Li.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.121
Please. Always open for you.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.823
How many you want today?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.791
A couple. Midnight snack.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.026
(camera clicks)

05:59.159 --> 06:00.260
(phone buttons clicking)

06:01.328 --> 06:03.531
Here you go.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.133
(loud crashing)
(gasps)

06:06.266 --> 06:07.367
Wait here.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.536
Wait. What was that?

06:08.669 --> 06:09.670
Sounded like glass breaking.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.809
(indistinct shouting)

06:15.943 --> 06:17.110
What happened?
I don't know.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.479
The video cut out.
(phone chimes)

06:18.612 --> 06:20.047
I just texted a photo of
Frank to Chloe.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.815
She recognizes him
from the bakery.

06:21.949 --> 06:22.850
Name's Frank Mitchell.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.184
On it.
She said he's been

06:24.317 --> 06:25.385
going to Ms. Li's
for years.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.488
HARRY:
Let me get an address.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.458
Something up?

06:30.558 --> 06:32.125
You remember Kisha?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.161
Yeah, the young woman
you met in jail.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.663
Yeah, how's she doing
with the counseling?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.330
It's a process.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.467
As part of her program,
she has to speak

06:39.567 --> 06:41.635
at a high school class today
about her experiences.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.336
I promised I'd be there.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.872
But it's not
for a few hours.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.841
Which means I got time
to pay Frank Mitchell a visit.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.577
(paper rips)

06:49.710 --> 06:53.581
HARRY: East Side.
Apartment 5-C.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.718
MAN: Stop! Please!
I don't know anything.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.052
(glass shatters)

06:59.186 --> 07:01.722
Please, I told you.
I don't know anything.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.992
Get off me!
(grunts)

07:06.226 --> 07:07.561
Hey!

07:09.396 --> 07:10.998
(both grunting)

07:13.066 --> 07:15.002
(groans)

07:24.945 --> 07:27.247
*

07:34.622 --> 07:35.889
Take a breath. Are you hurt?

07:36.023 --> 07:39.226
I'm fine, thanks.
Who are you?

07:39.359 --> 07:42.429
A concerned citizen.
What did he want?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.864
I don't know.
He just attacked me.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.766
You said you didn't
know anything.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.935
About what?

07:48.068 --> 07:50.470
Was it about Ms. Li?
The bakery?

07:50.604 --> 07:52.105
I know you were
there that night.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.473
How did you know that?

07:53.607 --> 07:54.642
I'm an investigator.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.243
The question is,
how'd he know?

07:56.376 --> 07:58.445
What exactly did he want?

08:00.113 --> 08:02.482
He wanted to know
if I saw who did it.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.984
God, what if
he was there that night?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.118
He knows I'm a witness!

08:05.252 --> 08:07.955
Okay, just calm down. Sit.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.927
What did you witness?

08:14.061 --> 08:15.295
Nothing. Like I told him,

08:15.428 --> 08:16.797
I didn't see anything
that night.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.932
I know you saw something.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.602
You heard windows breaking.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.937
You got spooked.
So then what?

08:24.071 --> 08:26.239
What happens
after the video ended?

08:28.408 --> 08:30.310
Look, I did just save you.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.145
And I might be able to stop
whoever that was

08:32.279 --> 08:34.481
from coming back-- but only
if you tell me what you know.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.184
We both heard a window break.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.152
Ms. Li told me to wait
while she went to the back.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.990
But I don't know what
happened next. Because...

08:43.123 --> 08:44.958
Because you didn't wait.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.760
You heard what sounded
like a break-in,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.696
and you left her there?
Alone?

08:48.829 --> 08:50.330
I was scared, okay?

08:50.463 --> 08:51.599
And I was right to be,
because she ended up dead.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.333
So yeah, I kept
my mouth shut

08:53.466 --> 08:54.868
'cause I was worried those guys
were gonna come after me.

08:55.002 --> 08:55.936
And I was right.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.304
Now it's "guys"?

08:57.437 --> 08:58.606
How do you know
how many there were?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.473
I heard voices...

09:00.608 --> 09:01.675
How many?
Two.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.311
Three, maybe.
I couldn't tell.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.780
I just wanted a pork bun.
I didn't do anything wrong.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.717
No. You didn't do anything.

09:09.850 --> 09:13.286
You didn't even call the cops.
And now she's dead.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.191
Hey, hey. W-What happens
if they come back?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.060
Then I guess you'll know
what it was like

09:20.193 --> 09:22.529
for Ms. Li
when no one helps you.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.334
MEL:
Unbelievable.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.502
This woman was his neighbor,
opened her door to him--

09:29.637 --> 09:31.204
and he just stood there
and did nothing?

09:31.338 --> 09:32.572
ROBYN: Yeah,
I'm right there with you.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.174
Situations like this,

09:34.307 --> 09:36.143
there's no such thing as
an "innocent bystander."

09:36.243 --> 09:38.979
So if these guys are gunning
for him, we can use that.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.648
Harry, how are you coming
with those reviews?

09:40.748 --> 09:42.582
Seems like, in this little
cesspool of hate,

09:42.716 --> 09:44.852
that the most offensive
and threatening posts

09:44.985 --> 09:46.086
came from the same IP address.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.354
Who owns the address?

09:47.487 --> 09:48.822
A rival bakery: Castelli's,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.357
a few blocks down from Ms. Li.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.926
I know competition can
get nasty, but murder?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.594
That's a whole other level.
HARRY: Yeah,

09:54.728 --> 09:56.396
but Ms. Li was putting
Castelli's out of business.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.831
I mean, their sales
were way down.

09:57.931 --> 09:58.899
They were fighting eviction.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.367
Do you know specifically

10:00.500 --> 10:02.002
who was writing the reviews?
HARRY: No.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.705
I could find out though,
but I'd need to go there myself.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.674
Ooh. Field trip
to a racist bakery.

10:06.774 --> 10:07.775
Sounds fun.
Hmm.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.176
Rob, you wanna come with?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.744
Uh, no, I gotta
meet up with Dante,

10:10.878 --> 10:12.579
bring him up to speed
on everything.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.682
Maybe he can shed some light
on these attacks in Chinatown.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.883
No problem. We got it.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.952
Sounds good.
(line beeps)

10:19.086 --> 10:21.188
Delilah?
DELILAH: Hey, Mom.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.056
Jess and Carly want to go
to the movies later.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.257
Is it okay if I go with them?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.860
I know you didn't
just ask me that.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.528
What's the problem?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.197
You bailed on Aunt Vi
this morning,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.199
and now you asking me
if you can stay out longer.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.034
Aunt Vi said it was fine.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.636
You know damn well
it wasn't fine.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.539
Aunt Vi's cassoulet
is a very big deal to her.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.710
She was showing you respect and
trust by sharing it with you,

10:42.810 --> 10:44.311
and you took it for granted.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.381
Hello? Are you there?
Did I lose you?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.750
No, I'm here.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.985
Do you want me to come home?

10:52.119 --> 10:54.621
(scoffs) No.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.157
You want to go
to the movies, go.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.993
I made Auntie a promise,
and unlike you, Delilah Fulton,

11:00.127 --> 11:02.395
I honor my commitments.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.965
(line beeps)

11:08.235 --> 11:09.502
(scoffs)

11:09.636 --> 11:11.504
(car alarm chirps)

11:26.653 --> 11:29.089
What can I get you?
Uh, let's see.
Blueberry scone looks good.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.924
Uh, macchiato.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.327
Um, oh, and some answers about
your neighbor, Li Wong.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.196
You know, the one taking
all your customers,

11:36.329 --> 11:37.798
forcing you
out of business.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.033
Crushing you, really,
in every conceivable way.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.434
Yeah, what about her?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.303
Oh, nothing serious--
we're just looking

11:43.436 --> 11:45.472
for the person who wrote racist,
threatening reviews on her Yelp

11:45.605 --> 11:47.340
right before she was murdered.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.176
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.846
Really? Because according to
this unintelligible tech gack,

11:52.980 --> 11:54.147
which my husband can
somehow decipher,

11:54.281 --> 11:55.548
the reviews came
from here,

11:55.682 --> 11:57.650
to your password-protected
Wi-Fi.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.120
Now, I don't know
what's more upsetting...

12:00.220 --> 12:02.890
the comment
about the "kung flu cupcakes,"

12:03.023 --> 12:04.825
which I'm sure you
find hilarious,

12:04.958 --> 12:07.727
or the fact that
you misspelled "foreigner."

12:07.861 --> 12:10.663
Ms. Li was an American,
by the way.
All right,

12:10.798 --> 12:11.865
this is ridiculous.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.666
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.735
No one from here wrote
those things.
Wrong.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.138
See, every phone is assigned
a unique code

12:18.238 --> 12:20.874
called a MAC address when
connected to a Wi-Fi network,

12:21.008 --> 12:23.310
so while we can't tell you
exactly which phone

12:23.410 --> 12:24.644
posted those reviews,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.746
I can tell you
that it does have

12:26.880 --> 12:28.581
Phone Finder enabled.
Which I'm about
to activate

12:28.715 --> 12:31.684
right about... now.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.686
(electronic dinging)

12:39.159 --> 12:40.828
MARSHALL:
Liam, this was you?

12:40.928 --> 12:42.595
How could you say things
like this?

12:42.729 --> 12:45.065
How could you
even think them?
I don't.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.100
I'm not, like, racist.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.002
(scoffs)
I mean,

12:49.102 --> 12:51.038
you realize that's the kind of
thing that influences people?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.372
I mean,
that's the kind of bile

12:52.505 --> 12:53.740
that gets people killed.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.008
I was just trying
to save the business.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.343
We've been here
for years,

12:56.443 --> 12:58.178
and she's been here a year,
and what,

12:58.278 --> 12:59.612
now we have to close?
How is that fair?
It's not fair.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.849
You know why?
'Cause 20 years ago,

13:01.949 --> 13:03.783
this block was part
of Chinatown.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.253
It was settled by immigrants
who worked their asses off

13:06.386 --> 13:08.421
to make it a beautiful
neighborhood for themselves

13:08.555 --> 13:10.423
and for their neighbors.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.692
So yeah,
it's not fair

13:12.792 --> 13:14.694
that Ms. Li had to be treated
like an outsider

13:14.794 --> 13:15.929
in her own neighborhood.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.297
Look, I know what he did
was messed up,

13:17.430 --> 13:18.465
but Liam was
working here when

13:18.598 --> 13:19.732
Ms. Li's got vandalized,

13:19.867 --> 13:21.068
and the whole family was upstate

13:21.201 --> 13:22.569
at a wedding when she died.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.305
I know my nephew can be
a complete ass...

13:26.306 --> 13:28.208
...but he's not a killer.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.745
What are you thinking?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.447
About how many hate crimes

13:34.581 --> 13:38.651
come across our desk and
how few we ever solve.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.587
Why is that?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.822
Because they're random.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.225
No connection
between the perp and the victim.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.594
Often no witnesses,
no real evidence.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.730
That's what makes hate crimes
so insidious.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.466
So unless it's caught on video,
the people that do this

13:53.600 --> 13:55.936
get away with it over and over.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.340
Which means whoever
vandalized Ms. Li's bakery

14:00.473 --> 14:02.943
may have done it before
somewhere else.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.677
Can you check
for any similar reports

14:04.811 --> 14:06.980
at other Asian businesses
in the area?

14:07.114 --> 14:09.582
Sure. But even if we
identified our vandals,

14:09.682 --> 14:12.452
we'd still have no way
of linking them to the fire.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.621
Maybe we do.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.858
It was found
outside Ms. Li's bakery

14:18.992 --> 14:20.493
the night of the fire.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.829
It may have the arsonist's
prints and DNA on it.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.933
You always got something
up your sleeve, don't you?

14:49.856 --> 14:51.959
(engine starts)

15:03.236 --> 15:04.304
(yells)
Looking for me?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.672
(grunting)

15:05.805 --> 15:06.906
Took you long enough
to make a move.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.241
(yells)

15:08.375 --> 15:09.809
You like terrorizing
innocent Asians, huh?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.012
Well, how's
that terror feel?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.394
You want to tell me who you are?

15:27.527 --> 15:28.861
You first.
I'm the one

15:28.996 --> 15:30.097
holding the gun.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.498
If you were gonna shoot me,

15:31.598 --> 15:33.266
you would have already.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.403
Not to mention your
little rendezvous

15:36.536 --> 15:38.238
out there
with that unmarked cop car.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.607
But...
you're not a cop yourself,

15:40.740 --> 15:42.842
so what are you?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.346
Some kind of vigilante
out to save our Chinese asses?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.015
Says the Masked Avenger.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.383
Why were you beating the hell
out of Frank Mitchell,

15:50.517 --> 15:51.684
and why were you following me?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.420
Ms. Li is a friend.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.089
Someone killed her,
and Frank was a witness.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.524
What's your excuse?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.926
Chloe San.
She asked me to do the same.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.294
Chloe?

16:01.428 --> 16:04.131
She loved Ms. Li.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.533
Used to be her
little shadow,

16:06.633 --> 16:09.936
following her
all around the bakery.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.240
(sighs)

16:19.079 --> 16:21.581
You know, instead of tripping
over each other,

16:21.714 --> 16:24.051
maybe we should compare notes.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.753
I don't like group projects,

16:26.886 --> 16:29.156
and I don't work with cops.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.723
Anymore, you mean.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.725
I know an ex-cop
when I see one.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.327
Colt .38 Special.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.595
Standard issue.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.131
NYPD?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.767
Until I couldn't
take it anymore.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.969
Nearly three decades

16:43.103 --> 16:46.173
hitting dead end after dead end
on cases like this.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.242
T-boned by a racist system.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.478
But these are my people.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.680
This is my community.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.749
I'm not gonna let Ms. Li
fall through the cracks.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.918
Neither am I.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.359
Now, we can split up,

17:06.493 --> 17:08.428
keep bumping into each other,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.331
ruin our chances of solving
this case for both Chloe

17:11.464 --> 17:12.765
and Ms. Li.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.267
Or...

17:14.367 --> 17:16.303
you can put your pride aside,

17:16.436 --> 17:17.870
and we can help
each other

17:18.004 --> 17:20.340
bring down these monsters.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.347
ROBYN:
Mel, Harry...

17:27.480 --> 17:29.116
Ray Lai.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.650
Mel and Harry work
with me.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.951
Doing what?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.320
Mixing drinks?

17:33.453 --> 17:34.687
Hmm.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.623
I know they don't
look like much...

17:36.723 --> 17:38.725
Hey.
No, honey, that's fair.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.993
But they are the
best in the biz.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.630
Okay, I forgive you.
Ray, would you like some coffee?

17:44.631 --> 17:47.300
How about something
a little stronger?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.636
Chloe was right.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.738
Ms. Li didn't tell her
everything.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.307
She didn't want to burden her
with her issues.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.842
But she told me.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.378
When her store was broken
into and vandalized,

17:58.511 --> 18:01.714
what Chloe didn't know was that
Ms. Li chased these men down.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.049
Two of them.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.384
They attacked her,

18:04.517 --> 18:06.386
and she fought back.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.255
Stabbed one of them in the eye
with her key.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.822
Badass.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.925
Yeah, she was
a tough one.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.094
I followed up at ERs,
looking for eye injuries,

18:15.228 --> 18:18.265
but... got nothing.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.567
I think the people who
vandalized her store

18:20.700 --> 18:22.569
and wrote those slurs
on her walls

18:22.702 --> 18:24.504
came back and killed her.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.342
What did they write on the wall?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.245
I took a photo.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.250
(exhales)

18:37.384 --> 18:40.052
Man, the hate
some people carry.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.054
She called me
instead of the cops.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.624
She'd seen friends go
through the reporting process,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.293
the one where you're
told it's not worth

18:46.426 --> 18:47.760
the paperwork.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.362
Or that what happened to
you wasn't a crime.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.797
It's gaslighting.
The more it happens,

18:50.930 --> 18:52.232
the less people report.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.468
I convinced her to at least
install a video camera

18:55.602 --> 18:57.404
that I had access to,

18:57.537 --> 18:59.306
and that's how I got to Frank.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.973
And all he heard were voices.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.576
(phone vibrating)

19:03.710 --> 19:05.278
Hey, Dante.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.646
Ran the cigarette you gave me.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.448
We were only able to get
a partial print.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.483
Not enough to find a match
in the system.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.419
(sighs)
What about the DNA?

19:12.552 --> 19:15.154
That will take a few days,
but I did get something.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.790
I found another instance of an
Asian-owned business in the area

19:17.924 --> 19:21.461
being broken into and vandalized
a week before Ms. Li's.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.930
Did the vandals leave graffiti
at the scene?

19:24.063 --> 19:25.898
Yeah. Threats and racial slurs.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.467
Can you send me a photo of it?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.068
Texting now.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.171
(phone whooshes)

19:32.305 --> 19:33.606
What do
you think?

19:33.740 --> 19:36.276
Same slurs, handwriting.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.110
Same guy.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.314
The break-in--

19:41.448 --> 19:43.115
were there any witnesses?
The owner, Mr. Cheung,

19:43.250 --> 19:44.517
was there when it happened.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.985
Did he describe the attackers?

19:46.118 --> 19:47.687
Now, that's the thing.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.589
Responding officers
never got a statement from him.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.291
Language barrier.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.460
They should have followed up,
but they never went back.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.462
A lot of the older generation
in Chinatown

19:55.595 --> 19:57.029
still speak Cantonese.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.532
It can be hard for patrols
to get a translator.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.935
Hey. Do you speak Cantonese?

20:07.507 --> 20:09.809
Heard you used to work
Chinatown.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.715
They had this nice place
for red-braised pork

20:15.848 --> 20:17.650
on Hester and Mulberry.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.119
They had this chili sauce
I used to buy jars of.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.522
I put it on everything:
steak, pasta...

20:22.655 --> 20:24.223
cereal.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.360
Sunrise Wok.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.629
(chuckles softly)
That was it.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.798
You spend a lot of time
around there?

20:31.898 --> 20:33.533
My dad did.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.702
NYPD was putting in
a lot of hours

20:35.835 --> 20:37.704
dealing with the fallout
of turf wars

20:37.837 --> 20:40.573
between the Chinatown gangs
back in the day.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.510
Dante.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.146
Was your father Big Ben?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.583
I knew Ben.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.819
He was a good man.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.021
One of the only cops
that tried to help me

20:55.154 --> 20:57.757
when I was hitting brick walls
on hate crime cases.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.260
What?

21:01.394 --> 21:04.196
Just don't hear a lot
of good things about my father.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.399
Well, it was hard being good
back then.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.268
Those walls were hard
to get through without smashing.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.737
Protect and serve.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.405
Not a lot of fine print

21:12.539 --> 21:14.707
when it came to people
who looked like us.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.677
Some things haven't changed.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.417
(speaking Cantonese)

21:24.551 --> 21:27.019
It happened late at night,
after close.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.221
(continues in Cantonese)
He'd been cleaning.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.523
Heard something...

21:30.623 --> 21:32.925
like the front door
being kicked open.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.061
(continues in Cantonese)

21:37.096 --> 21:39.131
Before he could turn,
something heavy hit him.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.769
When he came to,
he was on the ground.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.904
(continues in Cantonese)

21:54.614 --> 21:56.248
He looked up to see

21:56.383 --> 21:58.585
they had defaced a mural
his family painted

21:58.718 --> 22:00.887
back when the shop opened.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.055
(continues in Cantonese)

22:05.925 --> 22:07.427
Cops came, couldn't
understand him.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.929
Never came back.
Why didn't he follow up?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.603
(responds in Cantonese)

22:19.005 --> 22:21.073
If they're not gonna take
the time to listen to him,

22:21.173 --> 22:22.509
what's the point?

22:22.642 --> 22:24.744
Can he describe the men
who did this to him?

22:32.985 --> 22:34.654
(speaking Cantonese)

22:42.962 --> 22:45.097
When the attackers fled,
they hung a left

22:45.197 --> 22:47.934
and got in a red van.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.139
All right, pulled
the street cam footage

22:53.272 --> 22:55.842
from the time and location
that Mr. Cheung gave us.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.610
I got video footage
of the red van.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.546
Can't really make out the guys,
but I did get a license plate.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.647
Who owns the van?

23:00.780 --> 23:01.814
It's not really a "who."

23:01.948 --> 23:04.150
It's the Houston
Electrical Supply

23:04.283 --> 23:05.685
near Chinatown.
Not a lot in the way

23:05.818 --> 23:07.053
of employee records of any kind.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.387
Probably a lot of money
under the table,

23:08.521 --> 23:09.889
you know what I mean?
Place like this,

23:10.022 --> 23:11.958
they would know how to fake
an electric fire.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.793
MEL:
We know something else--
one of them

23:13.893 --> 23:16.028
should have a hell of a shiner,
courtesy of Ms. Li.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.797
Should we tell Dante?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.332
No, he's gonna need a lot more
to go on than this.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.535
We need to go in there
without raising suspicion,

23:22.669 --> 23:23.703
find something
he can move on

23:23.836 --> 23:25.472
without flashing his badge.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.007
If the cops had just gone back
to Mr. Cheung with a translator,

23:28.140 --> 23:30.242
they would have had these guys
two weeks ago.

23:30.376 --> 23:32.044
Ms. Li might still be alive.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.981
They're not gonna get a chance
to ever do this again.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.549
(phone chimes)

23:36.683 --> 23:39.251
Kisha's event.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.253
I told her I'd be there.

23:41.387 --> 23:42.421
Go. I got the shop.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.890
You sure you want to be messing

23:44.023 --> 23:45.492
with a bunch
of murderous racists?

23:45.592 --> 23:47.059
Don't even bother--
she was gone

23:47.193 --> 23:49.228
the second we got
the name of the joint. Besides,

23:49.361 --> 23:52.098
she's the one
they ought to worry about.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.736
(indistinct chatter)

23:56.869 --> 23:58.905
HARRY (over radio):
Do you see him?

23:59.038 --> 24:01.774
No, not yet.
So far everyone here

24:01.908 --> 24:03.843
has two
functional eyes.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.915
Help you
with something?
Yes. Hi.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.684
I just put in a new
electric panel recently,

24:11.784 --> 24:15.121
and you sent a guy to do it--
I can't remember his name,

24:15.254 --> 24:16.856
but he had a red van.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.759
Anyway, he told me that he
could get me a great deal

24:19.892 --> 24:21.761
on some lighting I
was thinking about.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.763
Is he here?
He's out right now,

24:23.896 --> 24:25.765
but I can help you.
What are you looking for?

24:25.898 --> 24:27.967
HARRY:
A racist dumpster fire
who drives a red van.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.736
(chuckles)
Yeah.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.371
Actually, he had
a few great ideas,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.473
so I'm happy to
wait for him.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.808
I really don't know
when he'll be back.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.476
Maybe if I could get his name?

24:39.311 --> 24:41.480
Okay, well, then I'll just wait.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.481
Suit yourself.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.150
Thanks.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.288
HARRY:
Look, if he's not there,
we can come back later.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.323
Yeah, fine.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.936
(door creaking)

25:14.246 --> 25:15.815
Harry, I've got the van.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.750
It's in a private lot
in the back.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.652
Wait, what do you mean,
"private lot"?

25:19.786 --> 25:21.520
Like, restricted-access private?

25:21.654 --> 25:22.989
Like, shouldn't-be-there
private?

25:23.122 --> 25:25.825
There are spray paint cans
in the van

25:25.958 --> 25:28.127
and cigarettes in the cupholder.
If we can match

25:28.260 --> 25:31.664
the cigarette butts in this van
to the one that Chloe found,

25:31.798 --> 25:33.766
we can link this van
and our two vandals

25:33.866 --> 25:35.467
to Ms. Li's murder.

25:35.602 --> 25:37.704
Please tell me you're not
about to break into that van.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.505
It'll take two seconds.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.473
Mel, please.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.014
(clacking)

25:51.483 --> 25:54.020
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

26:03.830 --> 26:05.632
So you're the one
who's looking for me, huh?

26:05.732 --> 26:09.201
I don't recognize you
from any house call.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.303
Guess I got the wrong guy.
Yeah, next
she's gonna say

26:11.403 --> 26:13.372
she tripped and
broke into my van.

26:13.505 --> 26:14.874
Well, maybe you
should call the cops.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.375
Maybe I will.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.810
Maybe we'll
just take a ride

26:17.910 --> 26:19.378
down to the scrapyard,

26:19.511 --> 26:20.913
have a little date,

26:21.047 --> 26:23.315
just the three of us.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.351
(grunting)

26:25.484 --> 26:27.186
HARRY:
Hello.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.723
Hi. Sorry. Sorry, I was looking
for, uh, extension cords,

26:30.857 --> 26:33.325
and, uh,
you just had yellow inside,

26:33.425 --> 26:36.228
which sort of clashes with my
whole sort of landscaping vibe.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.064
So, uh, I was just wondering

26:38.197 --> 26:40.399
if you had anything else--
a green would be ideal.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.501
Or maybe something earthy,
like a taupe?

26:46.372 --> 26:47.940
Gotcha.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.541
ROBYN:
Kisha.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.111
Why are you not in there?
I can't do this.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.413
I'm gonna freeze up
in front of all those kids

26:54.546 --> 26:56.015
and make a fool of myself.
I can't do it.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.684
Take a deep breath.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.052
Sit down.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.888
What's this about
freezing up?

27:02.021 --> 27:04.590
Because the girl I know
can't stop running her mouth.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.795
When I was in high school,
we had this lady

27:08.928 --> 27:11.630
from Scared Straight
come talk to us.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.734
And I still remember
how I felt about her, like...

27:14.867 --> 27:16.936
like she was a loser.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.873
I swore up and down I'd never
make those kind of mistakes.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.442
But I did.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.946
I had potential, you know.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.748
I was an athlete.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.717
Is that right?
Yeah.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.551
Everything from boxing

27:32.651 --> 27:35.121
to vaulting and high jump.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.056
I mean,
I wasn't technical with it,

27:37.156 --> 27:39.558
but I learned fast.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.795
It made me fearless,

27:42.929 --> 27:45.131
gave me an edge in sports.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.834
And got you in trouble
in the streets.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.103
And I'm the loser now.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.105
Those kids
are not gonna listen to me.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.074
They're gonna laugh--
and they should.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.575
Maybe they will.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.277
You know why?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.612
They haven't lived
in the world yet.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.482
They don't know that to
overcome and to be vulnerable,

28:03.615 --> 28:05.852
that's real success.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.520
Now you know what kind
of strength it took that woman

28:08.654 --> 28:11.323
to tell you her story
all those years ago.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.927
Now it's time to pay her
and yourself some respect.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.364
Why'd it have to be me?

28:18.497 --> 28:20.166
All those kids
in my class,

28:20.299 --> 28:21.267
they all made it.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.835
They're not here.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.470
Because most of them
probably had a safety net,

28:24.603 --> 28:26.272
family to catch them
when they fell.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.439
You didn't.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.809
You had to
catch yourself.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.312
I know it's hard.

28:33.445 --> 28:36.382
Yeah, but you didn't say
it was gonna be this hard.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.616
(clicks tongue)
(school bell rings)

28:37.716 --> 28:39.051
You got this.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.519
You're fearless.
Come on.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.521
I believe in you.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.391
Let's go teach these kids
something about the world.

28:45.524 --> 28:49.028
RAY:
That little stunt you pulled at
the electrical shop was ballsy.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.197
She would have liked you.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.299
Ms. Li.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.401
She liked people
who didn't back down.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.369
Then I get why she liked you.

29:01.673 --> 29:04.343
I remember
I was with my mom once

29:04.476 --> 29:07.346
when I was little, and we
were at the supermarket,

29:07.479 --> 29:10.316
and this guy
just walked up to her

29:10.416 --> 29:12.418
and spat at her.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.354
He got so close to us, I
could smell his cologne.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.156
And she did nothing.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.325
She didn't react.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.027
And in that moment,

29:21.160 --> 29:24.396
I realized she had to do that
to survive,

29:24.530 --> 29:26.532
to protect... us.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.167
Because we were alone.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.869
I mean, we were in a room
full of people, but...

29:30.002 --> 29:32.204
nobody did anything.

29:32.338 --> 29:34.340
Nobody stood up for us.
Nobody helped her.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.508
We were alone.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.046
And I decided right there...

29:40.179 --> 29:44.350
I'm never gonna be like
those people in the supermarket.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.854
I'm never gonna be the one
who doesn't say something.

29:51.023 --> 29:51.958
ROBYN:
Hey.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.525
Dante's running those cigarettes

29:53.625 --> 29:54.961
you found in Trevor's van.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.196
Now, if they match the one
from Ms. Li's murder,

29:57.296 --> 29:59.065
then we have our guys.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.699
Oh, they're our guys.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.601
Check out Trevor and Eric's
social media feeds.

30:02.734 --> 30:06.405
They are like conspiracy theory
influencers.

30:06.538 --> 30:07.907
Scapegoating Chinese Americans

30:08.040 --> 30:10.109
for everything
from disease to the economy.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.278
Egged on by some
of our very own leaders.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.913
How many of my people
have suffered

30:14.046 --> 30:15.982
because politicians
needed someone to blame?

30:16.115 --> 30:17.549
And how many of mine
because these morons

30:17.649 --> 30:18.750
can't tell the difference?

30:18.885 --> 30:20.419
Well, if these guys
are the killers,

30:20.552 --> 30:22.054
then we got to play this smart.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.289
Be patient.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.556
Wait for Dante.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.757
Did you find our killers?

30:25.892 --> 30:27.726
Chloe.
Chinatown community

30:27.826 --> 30:29.962
has been talking,
saying that you and a cop

30:30.096 --> 30:32.131
interviewed Mr. Cheung
and found a lead.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.565
So is it true?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.167
ROBYN:
Maybe.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.469
But we need hard evidence
before we can make a move.

30:37.603 --> 30:38.971
And that cigarette
you found

30:39.105 --> 30:40.306
might get us there.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.773
(speaks Cantonese)

30:41.908 --> 30:43.842
She would be
very proud of you.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.945
Her constant noise.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.746
(phone ringing)

30:47.846 --> 30:48.981
Dante.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.416
You're on speaker.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.683
Got the results.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.085
The cigarettes
from Trevor's van,

30:53.185 --> 30:54.286
the print's not a match

30:54.420 --> 30:56.122
to the one found
outside Ms. Li's.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.925
But they did match
to someone else we know.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.792
Who?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.832
Sorry to keep you waiting.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.502
You okay?

31:10.636 --> 31:12.504
Looks like you could
use a cigarette.

31:12.638 --> 31:15.641
I'd love to know
what I'm doing here.

31:15.774 --> 31:18.444
We're just tying up a few loose
ends in the murder of Li Wong.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.312
Murder?

31:20.446 --> 31:22.714
I-I don't know
how I'd be helpful.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.283
We know you were there
that night.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.052
Why don't you tell
me what happened.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.454
Uh, she let me in after hours
to buy some pastries.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.957
I heard a window break
in the back,

31:31.057 --> 31:33.559
and when she went to look,
I left.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.294
Did you hear any voices?

31:36.295 --> 31:39.065
Y-Yes,
but I didn't recognize them.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.899
I couldn't hear
what they were saying.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.969
I left pretty quickly.
Got it.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.836
Just one last thing.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.538
Do you recognize

31:46.672 --> 31:48.340
any of these men?

31:48.474 --> 31:51.310
Maybe you saw them on your way
in or out of the bakery.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.012
No.

31:54.013 --> 31:57.683
You don't recognize
these two men?

32:00.186 --> 32:03.189
(over speaker):
Surprising, considering you
grew up on the same block.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.856
That was
a long time ago.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.358
Fair enough. Thing is,

32:06.492 --> 32:08.727
we dug back into some
old social media...

32:08.860 --> 32:10.929
and found these.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.199
Taken just a
few years ago.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.202
Not to mention, we
have your fingerprints

32:16.335 --> 32:17.869
in Trevor's van.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.272
Still don't
recognize them?

32:20.406 --> 32:23.609
Didn't recognize their voices
at Ms. Li's that night?

32:26.612 --> 32:29.115
This can't be easy
to talk about.

32:30.116 --> 32:33.052
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
talking to someone you know.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.356
Hey, Frank.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.392
Maybe you saw me
around the bakery.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.394
I'm a regular at Ms. Li's, too.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.030
She must have
liked you.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.897
That's why she let you
in that night, right?

32:46.032 --> 32:47.799
She was doing you a kindness.

32:47.933 --> 32:49.901
You can do the same for her.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.404
Tell us the truth
about her death.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.972
DANTE:
You didn't know
what they'd do.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.208
Maybe you knew
they like to spray-paint walls,

32:56.308 --> 32:57.809
break down a few doors.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.411
Nothing too serious, right?

32:59.545 --> 33:00.946
Trevor tell you she
hit him in the face

33:01.080 --> 33:02.914
when they tried to mess
with her?

33:03.049 --> 33:05.217
They wanted revenge, right?
How'd they sell
it to you?

33:05.317 --> 33:07.153
Maybe they said they would rob
or scare her a little.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.920
They knew you'd make
the perfect lookout.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.956
But you're not
built for this.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.425
You don't really have the
stomach for the bloody stuff.
RAY: But...

33:13.559 --> 33:14.993
you were someone who
could distract her

33:15.127 --> 33:16.595
while they snuck in the back,

33:16.728 --> 33:18.464
because you
were someone she knew,

33:18.597 --> 33:19.931
someone she trusted.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.333
Please, stop.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.802
Come on. You know them.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.171
Easy, Ray.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.505
Did you ever
stand up to them?

33:26.638 --> 33:28.574
Did you ever even once
try to tell them

33:28.674 --> 33:30.476
that what they were doing
was wrong?

33:30.609 --> 33:32.244
What about when you realized
they planned to kill her?

33:32.344 --> 33:33.979
When was that?

33:34.113 --> 33:35.681
When they cornered her?
Locked the door?

33:35.814 --> 33:37.249
Was she scared?
Ray.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.650
She must have tried
to fight, run.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.152
Did they have to knock her out?

33:40.286 --> 33:42.354
Frank, look at me!
When did you realize

33:42.488 --> 33:43.789
they planned to kill my friend,

33:43.922 --> 33:45.857
before or after
she was burning alive?

33:45.991 --> 33:49.861
(panting):
I-I-I want a lawyer.

33:49.995 --> 33:52.030
I want a lawyer.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.472
I pushed too hard.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.208
He was always gonna lawyer up.

34:02.341 --> 34:03.442
We're not done.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.710
We'll find a path forward.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.313
Path?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.515
Are you kidding me?

34:09.648 --> 34:11.450
There is no path.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.652
30 miserable years
on the NYPD--

34:13.785 --> 34:14.820
my entire life.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.522
Let me run this down for you.

34:16.655 --> 34:17.823
No real evidence.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.791
No witnesses.
Everything circumstantial.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.360
What do you think
happens next?

34:21.493 --> 34:23.629
The bastards get away with it.

34:23.729 --> 34:26.465
And most likely they'll do it
to someone else next week.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.134
Ray...

34:28.234 --> 34:31.036
No! It's over.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.205
Ms. Li is dead.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.408
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.645
Let him go.
He's grieving.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.248
He needs to blow off
some steam.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.982
And he's right.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.818
But I'm not ready
to give up hope.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.487
I'll keep going at Frank.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.657
There's a next step here.
We'll find it.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.164
* I know you keep on pushing
against the wind... *

34:58.264 --> 35:00.499
ROBYN (singsongy):
I know what I smell.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.170
(gasps)
You made the cassoulet!

35:04.270 --> 35:06.938
And I have a feeling
it's gonna be the best one yet.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.940
Aunt Vi,
I know you were looking forward

35:09.074 --> 35:10.609
to making it with Delilah.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.844
I'm so sorry
you had to make it alone.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.680
Actually, I didn't.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.882
* You're not alone... *

35:17.015 --> 35:19.117
She came home.
Which I'm sure

35:19.251 --> 35:21.253
was entirely her idea.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.054
You think I had something
to do with it?

35:23.189 --> 35:24.089
Yes, I do.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.857
The bread was a nice touch.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.194
I told her she could stay out
if she wanted to.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.461
And what do you mean

35:29.595 --> 35:30.962
about the bread?
She brought home a loaf

35:31.096 --> 35:32.798
of the rustic bread we
like to eat with it.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.366
You know the one
I always forget to buy.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.967
You didn't tell her
to bring the bread?

35:36.101 --> 35:38.404
No, she did not tell me.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.607
But she did remind me
of what this means,

35:41.740 --> 35:43.309
to all of us.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.076
And I'm sorry
I took it for granted

35:45.211 --> 35:47.213
and went to go hang out
with my friends.

35:48.214 --> 35:51.149
(clicks tongue)
Oh...

35:51.283 --> 35:52.984
I'm comin' in.
No, please, no.

35:53.118 --> 35:55.587
Aw, group hug.
(laughs)

35:55.721 --> 35:58.557
You are the best.
Oh...

35:58.657 --> 36:01.227
Just don't you forget
who makes you free food, girl.
Mm-hmm.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.628
I won't. I won't.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.062
(laughing)

36:04.162 --> 36:05.797
The bread was
a nice touch.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.466
Why, thank you.
Hey, Aunt Vi,

36:07.599 --> 36:08.500
you think we have room
for someone else

36:08.634 --> 36:09.801
at the table tonight?

36:09.935 --> 36:10.902
Of course.
Who do you want to bring?

36:11.002 --> 36:13.071
(phone vibrating)

36:17.676 --> 36:19.745
Hey.
RAY:
I just wanted to let you know

36:19.845 --> 36:22.281
they're not gonna get away
with it.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.316
Not this time.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.319
Ray, whatever you're thinking
about doing,

36:27.453 --> 36:28.787
don't.

36:28.920 --> 36:29.988
Ray?

36:31.257 --> 36:32.991
Ray?

36:48.874 --> 36:52.544
(door closes)
We're closed.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.315
Hey, he said
we're closed,

36:56.448 --> 36:57.849
little man.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.987
Guy's looking
for a problem.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.655
No.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.190
I'm looking for you two.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.992
And why is that?

37:07.125 --> 37:08.727
You killed my friend.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.129
You couldn't even look her in
the eye to do it, could you?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.899
You left her alone in
a burning building like cowards.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.535
And how do you plan
on proving that?

37:16.668 --> 37:17.969
I can't.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.905
But you're gonna pay anyway.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.206
Ooh...
Uh-oh.

37:22.874 --> 37:23.975
Are you threatening us?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.377
What's the issue?

37:25.511 --> 37:27.846
English not your first language?
(chuckles)

37:27.979 --> 37:29.147
He thinks
he's smart.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.249
Oh, he ain't smart.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.319
Whatever you
think you know,

37:33.419 --> 37:35.421
no one else ever will.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.489
(grunting)

37:45.764 --> 37:47.165
(Trevor yells)

37:47.265 --> 37:48.567
(grunting continues)

37:51.503 --> 37:52.371
(straining)

37:52.504 --> 37:54.105
(grunting)

37:54.239 --> 37:55.607
(groans)

37:57.409 --> 37:59.411
(gasping)

38:02.381 --> 38:04.550
He's here.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.117
Must be inside.

38:06.251 --> 38:08.286
Dante, look.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.523
Why would he leave his gun
if he was going to kill them?

38:12.524 --> 38:13.759
Because he's not.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.261
He's gonna let them kill him.
He's wired.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.697
This is a suicide mission,

38:18.797 --> 38:20.866
and he's recording everything.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.377
DANTE:
Clear.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.412
ROBYN:
Clear.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.547
They're gone.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.115
Check the recorder.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.650
Listen.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.051
(indistinct shouting)

38:42.120 --> 38:43.254
Screw you!

38:43.389 --> 38:44.590
(grunts)

38:46.257 --> 38:47.926
Ray's phone is off.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.094
To trace the transmitter,
we'd have to

38:49.227 --> 38:50.729
triangulate the frequency.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.330
We don't have that kind of time.
They're gonna kill him.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.832
We need to figure out
where they'd take him.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.233
Somewhere they
can dump a body.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.635
Somewhere
they'd have ownership of.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.737
The scrapyard.
That troll said he wanted

38:58.837 --> 39:00.606
to take me down to the scrapyard

39:00.739 --> 39:02.073
for a date.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.642
And the nearest
scrapyard to the shop

39:03.775 --> 39:04.976
is in Greenpoint.

39:05.977 --> 39:06.912
Where you going?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.447
I'm closer.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.348
You're gonna kill me anyway.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.683
Just tell me

39:11.817 --> 39:13.251
what you did to her.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.820
I need to know.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.624
What about
what you people did to us?

39:18.757 --> 39:21.793
What you've done
to our country?

39:21.927 --> 39:23.595
You're the invaders.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.297
We have every right
to fight back.

39:26.432 --> 39:27.999
We have a duty.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.101
(laughs weakly)

39:30.201 --> 39:32.137
She ran a bakery.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.473
She was nothing
but a good, kind,

39:34.606 --> 39:36.141
hardworking woman.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.943
That bitch almost blinded me.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.178
And you deserve worse.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.656
You're... you're full of crap.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.858
You didn't kill Ms. Li

39:52.991 --> 39:54.493
because of principle.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.128
You did it because
you were beat

39:57.228 --> 39:59.130
by a 70-year-old woman,

39:59.230 --> 40:01.032
didn't you?

40:02.233 --> 40:05.671
I killed her
because she doesn't belong here.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.673
(gun cocks)

40:07.806 --> 40:09.340
And neither do you.

40:10.676 --> 40:13.344
(gunshots)

40:13.479 --> 40:14.580
Hands up!

40:17.382 --> 40:18.984
(gunshot)

40:25.323 --> 40:27.358
(sirens wailing)

40:27.493 --> 40:29.561
The recording Ray made
should be enough

40:29.695 --> 40:32.163
to charge Trevor and Eric
with the murder of Ms. Li.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.000
His own attempted murder, too.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.503
You think they'll
call it what it is?

40:37.603 --> 40:40.338
Think they'll charge
them with a hate crime?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.940
I do.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.675
This time.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.745
But how much pain does
that verdict have to cost?

40:49.114 --> 40:50.448
You don't have to...

40:50.582 --> 40:52.083
I'm coming with you.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.520
I gotta make sure you
don't do anything stupid.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.222
Apparently, you
can't be trusted on your own.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.127
It was... necessary.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.931
You are more necessary.

41:17.242 --> 41:19.277
(siren wailing)

41:25.116 --> 41:27.252
What is it?

41:28.554 --> 41:30.556
We got them...

41:30.656 --> 41:32.924
but these hate crimes...

41:33.058 --> 41:34.926
People want to pretend
they don't exist,

41:35.060 --> 41:36.928
so they act
like they don't see it,

41:37.062 --> 41:38.997
but when we
look away,

41:39.130 --> 41:40.732
we excuse it.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.234
Well, I know one person
who's gonna make sure

41:43.334 --> 41:46.504
nobody looks away on this one.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.508
Ms. Li Wong was family.

41:50.642 --> 41:51.910
She raised me.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.245
She called me
her "constant noise."

41:54.345 --> 41:56.748
Ms. Li opened her doors
to us all,

41:56.848 --> 41:59.317
without judgment, without fear.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.319
Welcome, Kisha.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.789
Thank you, Ms. Marsette.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.290
That looks good.

42:05.423 --> 42:06.758
Um...

42:06.858 --> 42:08.994
thank you for this.

42:09.127 --> 42:13.131
I haven't had a home-cooked
meal in so long, so, um...

42:13.264 --> 42:14.966
thank you.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.534
* I will stand for you... *

42:16.668 --> 42:19.370
From now on,
if you need a safety net,

42:19.504 --> 42:21.272
you got one right here.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.875
* Everybody *

42:24.009 --> 42:26.612
* Deserves to be free *

42:26.712 --> 42:28.714
She taught us
how to be neighbors,

42:28.847 --> 42:30.481
how to be accountable,

42:30.616 --> 42:32.718
how to be committed
to one another.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.720
And for those of you
who think hate

42:34.853 --> 42:36.187
can drown out
kindness like hers,

42:36.321 --> 42:38.223
I am here to tell you
that I will be

42:38.356 --> 42:40.291
Li Wong's constant noise.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.360
Okay.
(laughs)

42:42.493 --> 42:43.829
Careful, the
pot is hot.
Mmm!

42:43.962 --> 42:45.463
(exhales)

42:45.563 --> 42:47.065
DELILAH:
Smells delicious.

42:47.198 --> 42:51.737
* Everybody
(whooping, excited chatter)

42:51.870 --> 42:54.706
* Deserves
The guest first.

42:56.708 --> 42:59.577
* To be free

42:59.711 --> 43:01.747
* Yeah... *

43:01.880 --> 43:03.982
* Oh, yes. *
