Come on, man.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.269
If we're gonna open for boyz ii

You are old and feeble.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.095

a good point.

01:36.097 --> 01:38.097
We can't afford to get sick
right now.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.232

do when you get the flu?

>> huh?

02:43.297 --> 02:44.329

02:46.367 --> 02:48.167
Mac, do you want to lose this
singing contest?

02:48.169 --> 02:50.202
Why do you think we're
quarantining ourselves in the

02:50.204 --> 02:51.003
First place?

02:51.005 --> 02:51.970
>> to protect my life!

02:51.972 --> 02:54.273
>> no, to preserve our vocal
cords, okay?

02:54.275 --> 02:57.176
Which also means no alcohol,
guys.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.177
>> come on, dude!

02:58.179 --> 02:59.511
That's crazy.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.213
>> wait a minute, wait a minute,
that's a good idea.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.382
Because alcohol lowers your
immune system.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.350
>> well, why the hell are we
quarantining ourselves in a bar,

03:05.352 --> 03:06.351
If we can't drink?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.853
We got to drink.

in.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.800
Especially a pizza guy.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.037
Going house to house, handling
money, banging lonely broads.

Vaccines really do work.

like, every month, and I never

03:40.254 --> 03:41.720
Got sick.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.422

sick was because you and your

Mom would wear those ridiculous
bubble boy suits during the flu

07:37.291 --> 07:39.624
So I'm trying to figure, like,
who goes where.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.626
>> "same" as in "matching,"
not same as in jammed into

07:41.628 --> 07:43.428
The same set of clothing.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.897
>> okay, not sure that's
as good, 'cause this really

07:45.899 --> 07:47.499
Makes a splash with the crowd.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.001
Dee, what do you think
about all this?

07:50.003 --> 07:52.637
>> (hick accent): D-d-d-don't-
don't put me on the spot.

07:52.639 --> 07:57.275
I-I'm just, I-I-I'm just a
jesus-loving e-e-ex-marine.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.477
>> that's really good.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.312
I mean, so, so sad.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.646
>> it's supposed to be sad.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.115
It's supposed to guilt them
into voting for us, you know.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.317
(hick accent): That's not all.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.320
This bible's a bible of my
daddy who just di-di-died

08:08.322 --> 08:12.591
In my-my arms of-of throat
cancer, from-from eating

08:12.593 --> 08:16.127
Some-some-some bad pussy.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.596
>> hmm. Hmm.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.764
>> you just earned your spot at
the head of the suit, dee.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.932
That was really good.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.100
That was good.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.702
>> frank, what the hell
are you doing, dude?

08:23.704 --> 08:26.471
>> I'm getting rid of all this
contaminated crap!

08:26.473 --> 08:28.540
>> now, come on, you're going
crazy with this food

08:28.542 --> 08:29.341
Thing, frank.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.709
We need to eat.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.778
>> we need to eat, but we only
eat protected food from now on.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.315
Like, oranges and coconuts
and snow crab.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.950
>> no! No snow crabs!

08:38.952 --> 08:40.619
The shells could lacerate
your throats.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.053
Absolutely not.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.622
>> okay, well, someone's gonna
have to go out and get this

08:43.624 --> 08:44.723
Food, so I'll do it.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.357
>> no, no, no!

08:45.359 --> 08:46.525
You can go out together.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.859
You can't go out alone.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.161
In case one of you get sneezed
on, the other one can

08:50.163 --> 08:51.129
Report back.

08:51.131 --> 08:51.997
>> frank, tell you what.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.532
Mac and I will go out.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.701
And I guarantee we won't
get sneezed on.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.703
All right, dude, first things
first.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.871
Let's get some beer, man.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.706
You know, screw dennis
and his rules.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.142
The guy's, like, you know,
such a dick about shit.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.344
>> yeah, dude, he can be
so controlling, you know?

09:06.346 --> 09:08.713
He can do really cool stuff
with his dick, though.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.916
>> you gotta ease up on talking
about dicks, man.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.318
Like, it's just, it's too much
by this point.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.220
>> you think? Oh, wait a second.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.556
There's no... There's no
opening to this.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.590
>> shit, I'm sorry, dude.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.392
I forgot, there's no opening
in yours.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.562
But my mom rigged hers with a
special pouch so that she could

09:23.564 --> 09:25.564
Have her cocktails.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.898
See? It fills up.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.768
>> your mom rigged her suit so
she could drink booze?

09:29.770 --> 09:31.236
Dude, you mom's an alcoholic.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.737
>> my mom's not an alcoholic!

09:32.739 --> 09:35.574
>> no, bro! She is, but it's
totally cool, because it skips

09:35.576 --> 09:36.541
A generation.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.777
That's why you're not
an alcoholic.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.579
(woman coughs, mac gasps)
>> that's not good right

09:45.451 --> 09:46.051
There, man!

09:46.053 --> 09:47.218
There's too many bogeys!

09:47.220 --> 09:48.720
Let's get some fruit,
let's get out of here,

09:48.722 --> 09:50.455
Let's get back
to the quarantine.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.222
>> that's right, man.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.426
Let's get out of here.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.061
>> whoa! Stop!

09:56.063 --> 09:57.596
What is this? I love it!

09:57.598 --> 09:58.597
>> huh?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.065
>> what was all this?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.733
>> oh, it's just a little
dance move I've been working on.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.767
It's stupid.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.568
I was just practicing.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.070
>> no, man, that's sweet
as hell.

10:05.072 --> 10:05.637
Show me that shit.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.771
>> you like it?

10:06.773 --> 10:07.906
>> yeah!

10:07.908 --> 10:09.374
>> it sort of like a fly girl
power spin.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.375
I've been working on it.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.242
It's a...

10:11.244 --> 10:12.444
You want to see the whole thing?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.245
It's sort of a...

10:14.247 --> 10:17.616
Whoo! (grunts)
>> oh, shit, you all right?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.384
>> it's a balance thing.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.086
>> whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

10:21.088 --> 10:22.220
You got a breach!

10:22.222 --> 10:23.221
>> oh, shit!

10:23.223 --> 10:25.223
>> come on.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.257
Hey! Close your pit!

10:26.259 --> 10:26.791
Close your pit!

10:26.793 --> 10:27.792
>> don't tell frank.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.627
>> I won't tell frank.

10:28.629 --> 10:29.461
Hold your arm.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.261
>> don't tell frank.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.162
>> hold your breath. Go! Move!

10:31.164 --> 10:33.164
>> charlie, don't tell frank!

10:37.269 --> 10:39.304
>> look at all the hair.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.672
Look at the hair.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.674
It's like a goddamn
barbershop.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.643
Be on the lookout, deandra!

10:44.645 --> 10:45.610
>> yeah, copy that.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.678
Looking for hair.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.647
>> stop talking about hair,
please.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.848
It's very annoying to me.

10:49.850 --> 10:54.686
>> that's what carries
the disease, dennis-- the hair.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.488
We don't really need it.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.089
Look at us.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.659
We're evolving without it.

11:00.661 --> 11:05.096
We came from the apes,
and look at us now.

11:05.098 --> 11:11.036
One day, we'll be completely
hairless and totally pure.

11:11.038 --> 11:17.676
>> yeah, you should write
that down.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.344
>> what are you doing?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.846
>> cleaning, cleaning.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.649
You know, you said scrub
the place from top to bottom.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.886
And it was a good thing that I
did, too, because I'll tell

11:27.888 --> 11:28.887
You what.

11:28.889 --> 11:29.888
Mad dusty up there.

11:29.890 --> 11:30.555
>> yeah, good-good...

11:30.557 --> 11:31.856
Good thinking.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.691
>> yeah.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.726
>> yeah, yeah.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.739
Were you eating pizza
and drinking beer up there?

11:47.741 --> 11:51.676
>> yes, frank, I was eating and
drinking in a ceiling.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.545
I mean, will you use your head?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.547
>> no, I'm getting a little
stir crazy.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.081
>> yeah.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.315
>> that's-that's...

11:57.317 --> 11:58.983
>> yeah, it's driving you nuts.

11:58.985 --> 11:59.851
>> driving me nuts.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.819
>> I get it.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.721
>> right.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.189
One more thing.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.824
>> hmm?

12:11.363 --> 12:13.998
That's not mine.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.369
(frank growls)
hey, frank, are you kidding me?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.772
Goddamn it, it's just one beer!

12:20.774 --> 12:21.940
Oh!

12:21.942 --> 12:24.509
>> it only takes one germ, dee.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.211
>> oh, jesus!

12:26.213 --> 12:28.913
>> of course, how anybody thinks
that a germ could survive

12:28.915 --> 12:31.950
A scalding hot pizza
is beyond me.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.219
(coughs)
>> oh, dennis, you don't

12:34.221 --> 12:35.620
Look good.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.790
>> trust me, dee, if I found
myself getting sick, I would

12:38.792 --> 12:41.793
Simply say...

12:41.795 --> 12:47.031
"sickness be gone!"
(dennis groans)

12:47.033 --> 12:49.934
(dee shrieks)
>> it's all here, you know:

12:49.936 --> 12:52.771
Oranges, hand sanitizer,
basically everything.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.938
No snow crabs, you know.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.373
>> hey, where's dee?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.443
>> quarantined.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.379
There was a breach.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.548
No breaches on your end, right?

13:03.550 --> 13:04.616
>> no.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.817
>> no, no breaches.

13:05.819 --> 13:06.785
>> yeah. Everything's cool.

13:06.787 --> 13:07.886
>> no, no, breaches.

13:07.888 --> 13:08.887
>> yeah, everything was cool.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.988
Yeah, everything was good.

13:09.990 --> 13:10.989
>> good. I'm gonna go shave.

13:10.991 --> 13:15.260
Get all this filthy hair
off my face.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.728
>> oh.

13:16.730 --> 13:19.664
>> then when I come back,
we'll play some games so nobody

13:19.666 --> 13:20.965
Goes nuts or nothing.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.034
(humming)
>> uh, movie, movie.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.011
Okay, movie.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.846
Two, three, four, five words.

13:34.848 --> 13:35.914
Doesn't matter?

13:35.916 --> 13:38.316
>>   <i>ocean's eleven.</i>

13:40.286 --> 13:42.487
<i>Ocean's twelve!</i>

13:42.489 --> 13:43.822
<i>Ocean's thirteen!</i>

13:43.824 --> 13:45.824
>> frank, I can't concentrate
when you look like this.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.025
You look ridiculous, man.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.860
It was <i>what's eating</i>
<i>gilbert grape.</i>

13:48.862 --> 13:52.263
>> that's where all the bacteria
lies, charlie, in your hair.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.932
That's why I shaved it off.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.600
Now it just flows off my body.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.435
You should do the same, mm-hmm.

13:57.437 --> 14:01.639
(mac sneezes)
>> he breached! He breached!

14:01.641 --> 14:02.841
His suit ripped in the store!

14:02.843 --> 14:05.310
He tried to do, like, a power
spin, and it ripped.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.477
And he probably got sick!

14:06.479 --> 14:08.646
>> that's not true! Oh, you rat!

14:08.648 --> 14:09.714
This is bullshit!

14:09.716 --> 14:10.715
This is bullshit!

14:10.717 --> 14:11.716
I feel fine.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.052
(door closes)
you should stand over there

14:14.054 --> 14:16.020
'cause I think I'm really
getting the flu.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.489
>> oh, I'm-I'm sick as a dog
already.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.826
>> oh, if you guys are getting
sick, then stay away from me.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.294
>> holy shit, dude!

14:23.296 --> 14:25.697
I think we need to call 911 for
you.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.732
>> hey, should we work on our
harmonies?

14:27.734 --> 14:28.733
>> seriously, dude?

14:28.735 --> 14:30.735
I think we need to get you to a
hospital.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.904
(singing high-pitched note)
>> does that sound like a man

14:49.421 --> 14:52.924
Who needs to be in a hospital?

14:52.926 --> 14:53.892
>> yeah, dude.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.093
>> from the top.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.896

(charlie chewing)

15:12.278 --> 15:13.578
>> charlie?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.779
Charlie, look at that.

15:14.781 --> 15:15.947
Look how clean I am.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.049
>> dude, you look like a
shriveled raisin.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.451
>> it's all about purity,
charlie.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.453
Humans are filthy.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.055
Dirty filthy.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.390
>> all right, man.

15:25.392 --> 15:30.128
>> you got them mixing with
beasts...

15:30.130 --> 15:32.096
Fowl, rodents.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.132
>> people do what they do, man.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.967
What am I gonna do about it?

15:35.969 --> 15:40.138
>> when I get out of here,
I'm gonna clean philadelphia.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.139
>> good.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.608
>> a giant cleanse.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.544
>> well, good luck with that.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.947
>> not the city...

15:48.949 --> 15:52.083
The population.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.585
>> okay, well...

15:54.587 --> 15:57.055
Go for it.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.333
>> I can't stop shaking.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.602
It's so hot and also so cold.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.571
>> what's up, what's up?

16:13.573 --> 16:14.639
Talking hot and cold?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.773
>> mm-hmm.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.141
Charlie, are you sick, too?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.309
>> hmm, sick?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.111
Nah, frank's all trying to
shave me and shit.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.779
I'm like, "dude, no way."

16:21.781 --> 16:23.848
So, I figured I'd hang out with
you guys instead, you know?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.850
We're very sick, we have the
flu.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.852
If you... If you stay in here,
you're gonna get sick.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.088
>> good, he deserves it for
ratting me out.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.757
>> please, mac, I've been
vaccinated for every disease in

16:32.759 --> 16:33.758
The book.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.461
I'm gonna be just fine.

16:36.463 --> 16:42.100
(charlie vomiting)
oh, god.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.634
That's a lot of throw up.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.104
>> this flu is so brutal.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.040
(dennis coughs)
>> hey, guys?

16:49.042 --> 16:52.543
I think I might be coming down
with something, too.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.445
>> are you kidding me, dude?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.114
Like, I think you're gonna die.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.148
>> I think I'm gonna die.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.218
I've never felt like this before
in my life.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.021
>> if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna
go down drinking.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.223
Anyone want some booze?

17:05.225 --> 17:07.025
>> I knew you drank cleaning
supplies.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.060
>> no, dude, this is booze.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.361
I stash whiskey in here.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.230
>> dude, you are an alcoholic.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.698
>> whatever.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.701
Dee stashes warm beer in the
ceiling of the back office.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.137
>> I keep a flask of créme de
menthe behind the jukebox in the

17:19.139 --> 17:20.671
Bar, it's not a big deal.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.140
>> just drink, you know, because
this might be our last chance.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.207
>> bottoms up.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.209
(dee groans, gulps)
>> I'm not getting it.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.517
So you crawl around on the bed,
looking for minerals?

17:32.519 --> 17:33.885
>> uh, no.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.520
If I'm looking for minerals,
I got to be under the bed.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.255
Minerals on top of the bed
doesn't make any sense,

17:37.257 --> 17:38.089
Actually.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.090
>> none of this makes any sense.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.425
It's insane.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.593
>> you know, I don't know about
you guys, and I don't know why

17:42.595 --> 17:44.695
This is happening, but I
actually feel a lot better.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.730
>> well, you look better.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.531
You guys all look better.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.499
I'm actually feeling better,
too.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.267
>> I feel great.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.268
>> yeah.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.569
>> how is that even possible?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.738
All we've been doing is sitting
here and drinking.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.706
How could we have gotten better
so quickly?

17:55.708 --> 17:57.241
>> oh, my god, you guys.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.111
You guys, we haven't been
drinking since we quarantined

18:00.113 --> 18:01.179
Ourselves into the bar.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.947
At least since we got stuck
in the bathroom.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.115
>> oh, that's right.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.750
>> wait, wait, wait, so what are
you saying?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.085
That-that we never had the flu?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.453
We were just having alcohol
withdrawal?

18:08.455 --> 18:09.520
>> yeah.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.521
>> alcohol withdrawals!

18:10.523 --> 18:11.522
That's great!

18:11.524 --> 18:14.292
>> is it great? It means
we're all alcoholics.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.526
>> mac & charlie: Ah...

18:15.528 --> 18:16.561
>> yeah, yeah... Right.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.763
What do we do with that
information?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.565
>> what do you do with
any information?

18:20.567 --> 18:23.067
You just stuff it deep down
inside and keep an eye on it.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.135
>> you keep it.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.269
>> I'm certainly not gonna
stop drinking.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.204
>> I mean, I physically can't.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.138
>> no, no, not at this point.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.272
>> we're in, we're in too deep.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.073
>> yeah.

18:29.075 --> 18:29.874
>> I'm a... I'm a young guy.

18:29.876 --> 18:30.775
>> just kids having fun, right?

18:30.777 --> 18:31.576
>> that's right.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.878
So let's bust this door
down, mac.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.214
What do you say, you want
to roundhouse the door for us?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.281
>> I was gonna suggest that!

18:37.283 --> 18:38.249
>> yeah, I know you were, buddy.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.283
That's why I said it.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.985
Just do it and get it over with.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.887
>> hold on, hold on, though.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.289
If we don't want to break the
door, I have a key.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.491
>> you've got a key?!

18:46.493 --> 18:49.160
We've been in here this whole
time, and you could've

18:49.162 --> 18:50.161
Let us out?!

18:50.163 --> 18:52.330
>> I didn't know that we were
trapped in here.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.764
I thought we were just
playing quarantine.

18:53.766 --> 18:54.732
>> what the...?!

18:54.734 --> 18:56.167
No, we're not playing
quarantine.

18:56.169 --> 18:56.901
We're quarantined.

18:56.903 --> 18:57.568
>> let's go.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.737
>> just open the door.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.606
>> yo, frank! We're not sick.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.341
>> yeah, we're fine, dude. We...

19:03.343 --> 19:05.576
Whoa. What the hell is this?

19:05.578 --> 19:08.112
>> oh, shit, I think
it's hand sanitizer.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.180
>> hmm?

19:09.182 --> 19:10.181
>> hand sanitizer?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.349
>> where is it going?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.251
>> frank?

19:13.253 --> 19:17.155
Uh, why is there hand sanitizer
all over the floor?

19:17.157 --> 19:19.290
>> it goes in here and...

19:19.292 --> 19:20.124
>> oh!

19:20.126 --> 19:21.159
>> frank?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.160
>> oh, my god!

19:22.162 --> 19:25.196
>> what the hell did you do
to yourself?

19:25.198 --> 19:28.966
>> I just want to be pure.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.135
>> god, what are we gonna
do about this?

19:31.137 --> 19:34.272
>> probably get him to the
hospital, right?

19:34.274 --> 19:38.943
