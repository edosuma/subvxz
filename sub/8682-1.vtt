00:50.175 --> 00:52.928
Hello, everybody!
Harry Doyle here

00:53.011 --> 00:55.138
welcoming
all you Wahoo maniacs

00:55.264 --> 00:57.975
to theyear's
first session of Tribe Talk.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.351
As you know,

00:59.434 --> 01:02.062
the Indians had
a Cinderella season last year.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.357
Despite the fact
that toxic owner Rachel Phelps

01:05.440 --> 01:08.485
wanted the team to lose
so she could move it to Florida,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.571
the Indians won
the American League East

01:10.654 --> 01:13.365
for the first time
since divisional play began.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.201
Rachel's gone now,
thank God,

01:16.285 --> 01:17.619
having sold the team

01:17.703 --> 01:20.163
to retired Indian third baseman
Roger Dorn,

01:20.205 --> 01:23.542
after a long, hard-fought
series of negotiations.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.170
I might be willing
to go as high as 100.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.504
120.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.673
120? You just
started at 110.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.008
130.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.176
Rachel,
this isn't fair.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.177
140.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.219
130.
150.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.220
We'll take it.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.223
Oh, you're good, Dorn.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.186
Even with Dorn
in the owner's box,

01:42.269 --> 01:44.396
the Indians
are solid favorites

01:44.479 --> 01:45.439
to repeat in the East

01:45.564 --> 01:48.483
and go all the way
to the World Series.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.610
And why not?

01:49.735 --> 01:53.197
Look at the lineup
we have coming back.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.199
First of all,
the Cuban Crusher,

01:55.282 --> 01:56.909
the voodoo man
with the bad attitude,

01:57.034 --> 01:58.952
Pedro Cerrano.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.997
Even though his training methods
were a little unusual,

02:02.080 --> 02:03.916
Pedro finished
in the top five

02:03.999 --> 02:06.210
in homers, RBIs,
slugging percentage,

02:06.293 --> 02:08.336
and total baldness.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.172
Also back
is center fielder

02:10.255 --> 02:12.090
Willie Mays Hayes,

02:12.174 --> 02:14.218
who came out of nowhere
to lead the league

02:14.301 --> 02:16.595
in great catches
and stolen bases.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.640
We're told he starred in an action movie
during the off-season,

02:19.932 --> 02:22.267
where he not only
did his own stunts,

02:22.351 --> 02:24.061
but even his own acting,

02:24.144 --> 02:26.230
and don't forget catcher
and team leader

02:26.313 --> 02:28.065
Jake Taylor.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.109
Despite chronic knee problems,
he had a fine season,

02:31.235 --> 02:33.111
and beat out the bunt
that drove in the run

02:33.237 --> 02:35.948
that won
the division title.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.283
And finally, one of
the brightest young stars

02:38.408 --> 02:42.162
in the game today-
Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.956
Vaughn began the season

02:44.039 --> 02:46.333
in the uniform
of the California Penal League

02:46.458 --> 02:49.670
and had some control problems
early on.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.464
But with the help
of a pair of black horn-rims,

02:52.589 --> 02:54.424
he went on
to set a major league record

02:54.508 --> 02:56.593
for strikeouts
in one season

02:56.718 --> 02:58.637
by an ex-car thief.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.266
All in all, things couldn't be
looking better for the Tribe.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.608
Guys! Guys!
We signed Jack Parkman!

03:11.692 --> 03:15.529
- Parkman? - We signed
Parkman! - Alright!

03:15.612 --> 03:18.115
- Hey, you can add 42 homers to our lineup.
- At least.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.119
Guys, this is theyear
we go all the way.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.495
All the way!

03:23.620 --> 03:26.957
All the way! All the way!

03:27.040 --> 03:32.129
All the way!
All the way! All the way!

03:51.440 --> 03:53.942
Listen. Sounds like a Harley.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.946
It's got to be him.

04:04.703 --> 04:08.415
Wild thing

04:08.540 --> 04:10.876
You make my heart sing

04:12.544 --> 04:13.462
False alarm.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.019
Whoa. Look at that.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.991
Hi, gang.
How's it going?

04:45.494 --> 04:48.247
Appreciate you all coming out.
Good to see you.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.374
Yeah. Nice outfits.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.917
Those haircuts are cute.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.168
Benny, I thought
you were still in jail.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.253
I escaped.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.047
That-a-boy.
What do you say, big guy?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.091
See you in the show
some day.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.429
Cute? Say it ain't so, Rick.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.265
Yeah, right.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.189
Ahh.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.157
Jake, how you doing?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.326
Fine.
Good to see you again, Lou.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.578
How's the leg?

05:27.703 --> 05:28.620
Good. Good.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.622
Feel like a kid
again, Skip.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.374
Good. There's a rookie in camp

05:32.457 --> 05:35.919
I'm gonna need your help
with for a couple of weeks. Baker!

05:40.007 --> 05:42.968
Jake, this here
is Rube Baker.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.930
I want you to help him
with a little problem he has.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.519
Alright.

05:52.644 --> 05:56.064
Mr. Taylor, uh, ooh!

05:56.148 --> 05:58.108
I- I knew you know
from which you speak.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.110
I'm sure you can help me
with my problem,

06:00.194 --> 06:01.862
which I'm bound to beat,

06:01.987 --> 06:03.530
because there ain't no odds
against being yourself

06:03.614 --> 06:05.324
no matterwhat
the percentages are.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.452
Let me ask you
something, uh, Rube?

06:08.535 --> 06:12.498
I bet you're wondering
how I get the nickname Rube.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.958
No, I got a pretty good idea
how that happened.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.336
What exactly
is your problem?

06:18.504 --> 06:19.922
Well, uh...

06:20.005 --> 06:22.633
Hell, that's the biggest
damn car I ever saw.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.898
Everything I do

06:39.149 --> 06:42.110
Got to be funky

06:43.529 --> 06:46.031
Everything I do

06:46.156 --> 06:47.282
People, now

06:47.366 --> 06:49.201
Got to be funky

06:49.284 --> 06:50.577
Honey, take a picture.

06:50.661 --> 06:51.578
Say,Jake!

06:51.662 --> 06:52.579
Hey, Willie!

06:52.663 --> 06:54.540
If you ain't careful

06:54.665 --> 06:57.876
You just might get
some funk on you

06:58.001 --> 06:59.962
Who are they?

07:00.045 --> 07:03.173
They are
our center fielder.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.175
Oh.

07:08.887 --> 07:09.888
What's up?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.557
Hey, hey, Willie!

07:11.682 --> 07:15.269
What's up?
Hey, welcome back.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.062
Nice little do there.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.188
What, you running
for office?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.440
No, I'm just trying
to clean up my act.

07:20.566 --> 07:23.569
Can't play the street punk
when you're making 7 figures, you know?

07:23.694 --> 07:25.863
Who's that?

07:27.656 --> 07:31.201
It's got to be Parkman,
our new free agent. Nice jacket.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.956
Come on.
Let's check it out.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.213
Say, Parkman,
I just wanted to say

07:43.255 --> 07:45.465
that even though we're competing
for the same position,

07:45.591 --> 07:47.968
I'm glad they signed you.
You're a good ball player.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.928
Cut the crap, Taylor.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.513
I don't like you.
You don't like me.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.266
I just hope you don't blame
your bum knees when I take your job.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.481
You want me
to bean him?

08:01.565 --> 08:04.568
I'll just beat him out
for the job.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.446
"Avoid spraying
toward open flame.

08:07.529 --> 08:10.282
Contents under pressure.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.868
Shake can before use. "

08:14.119 --> 08:15.454
" Press-" What?

08:21.293 --> 08:25.964
Jeez... I-I'm sorry,
Mister... Cerrano.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.091
I, uh, just...

08:33.222 --> 08:35.349
You are forgiven.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.309
I love you all!
Ha ha ha!

08:38.393 --> 08:41.145
Ha ha ha!

08:41.230 --> 08:42.856
Jake.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.274
Lou.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.277
My great and good friends.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.529
How you doing?

08:48.654 --> 08:50.280
You OK, Pedro?

08:50.364 --> 08:52.157
OK?

08:52.282 --> 08:53.450
I free and clear.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.494
Did he say free and queer?

08:55.577 --> 08:58.080
Clear.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.917
Free of anger and hostility that
run Cerrano's life.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.340
Meditation is key.

09:08.465 --> 09:12.594
Five months under
Master Hawa Masasuri.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.012
No more voodoo,

09:14.096 --> 09:16.974
just much peace
and wideness of love.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.560
At one with all.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.498
Whoo! Get up there, baby.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.876
It's beautiful, man.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.294
Ohh...

09:50.048 --> 09:51.967
Awoo!

09:52.050 --> 09:53.468
Fore!

09:53.552 --> 09:55.179
370.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.222
Whoopee.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.102
Hey, Hayes,
what are you doing?

10:02.227 --> 10:03.562
Going deep.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.189
I buffed up this winter.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.150
You needed to to wear
all that jewelry.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.860
Just remember,
you're our lead-off man.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.362
You're paid to get on base,
not try to hit home runs.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.032
Keep the ball
on the ground.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.499
That's enough
for the first day.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.334
After five pitches?

10:27.794 --> 10:31.131
Say, what was that last pitch
you threw me?

10:31.215 --> 10:33.217
I call it
the Eliminator.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.886
It's a combination
screwball/split finger.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.304
You name
your pitches now?

10:37.429 --> 10:39.932
Yeah. Sort of
a marketing thing,

10:40.098 --> 10:41.850
You know,
like Nolan Ryan's Express.

10:41.934 --> 10:45.062
I'm also working on
a forkball/slider combination.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.396
Well, whatever happened

10:46.438 --> 10:48.315
to the boring, old
96-mile-an-hour fastball?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.650
The Terminator?

10:49.733 --> 10:50.609
Whatever.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.194
It'll be there
when I need it.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.446
Jake, I don't want to become
one of these one-year phenoms

10:54.446 --> 10:56.990
who burns himself out
throwing nothing but gas.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.410
I got to start thinking
in terms of a career, not just a season.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.086
You workwith Rube
on his little problem yet?

11:13.131 --> 11:14.550
Now step and throw!

11:16.677 --> 11:19.054
Put it down again.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.305
He looks pretty
sharp to me.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.890
What exactly
is his problem?

11:37.447 --> 11:39.324
Doggone it!

11:39.449 --> 11:40.617
Jeez, Louise!

11:40.701 --> 11:42.160
Uh, Duke...

11:42.286 --> 11:43.412
Rube...

11:45.497 --> 11:47.249
what's going
through your head

11:47.332 --> 11:50.252
just before you throw the ball back
to the pitcher?

11:50.335 --> 11:51.920
I'm thinking,
"I don't want to screw this up. "

11:52.004 --> 11:54.423
What are you thinking
when you throw a strike

11:54.506 --> 11:56.466
to nail a runner
down at second base?

11:56.508 --> 11:59.511
I'm not thinking nothing.
I just throw it.

11:59.595 --> 12:03.056
You see what
I'm getting at?

12:03.182 --> 12:06.018
You want the pitcher to pitch
from second base?

12:07.978 --> 12:09.479
Aw...

12:09.563 --> 12:11.356
Ifwe walk somebody,
this guy's going to

12:11.440 --> 12:14.026
turn it into an inside-the-park
home run.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.321
Yeah. Whoa.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.323
What's this,
your first spring babe, Vaughn?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.451
Who, her? No.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.037
There she is.

12:31.168 --> 12:35.005
Ooh-whee!
Suggie-dug it now.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.466
Excuse me, gentlemen.

12:39.176 --> 12:39.885
Hi, baby.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.136
Hey, Flan, how are you?

12:42.387 --> 12:44.264
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.267
Good news. The General Cereals
people are interested...

12:47.518 --> 12:49.186
The money's gone
to his head.

12:49.186 --> 12:49.645
Yeah.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.190
Let's go take a ride
in my limo.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.486
There it is, man.
Watch this.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.239
Hey.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.659
Unh!

13:03.909 --> 13:07.913
Aah!

13:08.038 --> 13:10.666
Willie Mays Hayes is...

13:12.584 --> 13:13.669
Ha ha ha!

13:24.596 --> 13:27.391
Jesse "The Body" Ventura
is...

13:31.061 --> 13:34.439
Together,
they're taking on the mob.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.070
Mine fell
the hardest.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.114
Mine are
the deadest.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.328
These guys
play for keeps.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.207
Coming to a theater
near you.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.004
That spot didn't show
the real dramatic parts,

13:57.129 --> 13:59.882
like where they kill my boa constrictor
and I vow revenge.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.926
Oh.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.386
Hey, you're limping.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.471
A little.
What about you?

14:06.597 --> 14:08.974
Yeah, well, I'm a broken-down,
has-been catcher.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.434
You're our
lead-off man.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.477
I sprained my knee doing a stunt
for the flick.

14:12.561 --> 14:13.979
Ohh.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.648
Don't worry, though.
I'm going to be fine by opening day.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.276
Besides,
I'm a power hitter now.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.326
What do you call
that garbage?

14:27.451 --> 14:29.161
That's the Eliminator.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.872
- The Eliminator?
- I got a new one I'll showya.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.291
If you get a piece of it,
I'll let you name it.

14:49.431 --> 14:53.602
I'd, uh, call it
The Masturbator.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.194
Excellent pitch, man.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.821
Cerrano fool,
but ball and blue sky-

15:04.947 --> 15:07.407
beautiful,

15:07.533 --> 15:09.993
like lonely snowflake.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.958
Just pretend
the pitcher's the second baseman.

15:19.962 --> 15:20.879
Uh!

15:20.963 --> 15:21.880
Aah!

15:21.964 --> 15:23.882
Aah! Oh,Jeez!

15:24.007 --> 15:25.884
Goldarn it to heck!

15:26.009 --> 15:27.886
Shoot.

15:27.928 --> 15:31.223
I couldn't hit sand
if fell off a camel.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.226
Criminelli, they're going
to send me back to Omaha,

15:34.309 --> 15:36.854
and I don't
even live there!

15:36.937 --> 15:39.064
I'm gone.
I'm buzzard bait.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.108
They're gonna cut me.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.193
I know they're
gonna cut me.

15:43.277 --> 15:44.611
Cripes!

15:44.903 --> 15:50.450
Rube, you look at Playboy
all the time, don't you?

15:50.534 --> 15:52.995
No, I don't
just look at it.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.371
I- I read
the articles.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.539
Yeah, sure you do.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.375
I do. I especially like
where they tell you

15:58.458 --> 16:00.419
what the girls'
interests are,

16:00.502 --> 16:02.921
you know, like Betsy loves
surfing, gardening,

16:03.005 --> 16:04.089
and working
on motorcycles.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.301
You memorize them?

16:07.426 --> 16:09.386
Yep, I guess I do.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.638
Bingo.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.390
Huh?

16:20.355 --> 16:22.858
Just do what
I told you, OK?

16:26.361 --> 16:29.448
Could you throw that back
to the pitcher, please?

16:32.075 --> 16:33.911
Thank you.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.293
Louise teaches aerobics
and loves short shorts,

16:41.418 --> 16:44.546
unicorns, and reruns
of Three's Company.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.215
Her favorite sports are...

16:46.298 --> 16:47.257
High!

16:47.299 --> 16:50.385
Air hockey, checkers,

16:50.469 --> 16:54.598
and calf-roping.
Whoo! Yeah!

17:02.147 --> 17:04.650
Wow. Willie's really
got some power.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.319
Off a guywho'll be bagging groceries
in a couple weeks.

17:20.624 --> 17:21.625
Ah! Unh!

17:23.544 --> 17:25.963
Ooh.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.339
It must be tough
to be old.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.974
You're out!

17:39.184 --> 17:40.477
Hey!

17:42.688 --> 17:45.941
- Cool play, man. I love it!
- Huh?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.994
Damn.

18:02.374 --> 18:06.128
One moreyear.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.631
Yes.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.634
Rube, what are
you doing?

18:14.887 --> 18:16.096
Ifthere's a red tag
in there,

18:16.221 --> 18:17.598
that means
I'm outta here, right?

18:17.723 --> 18:21.018
Uh-huh.
There's always nextyear.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.269
Yeah. What the hell.

18:22.394 --> 18:24.563
My momma always said
it's better to eat shit

18:24.688 --> 18:26.857
than not eat at all.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.526
In the minor leagues you'll play
every day, and think of all the-

18:29.651 --> 18:33.197
I made the team.
I made the team! We did it!

18:35.574 --> 18:37.534
Pedro,
guess what, man-

18:37.618 --> 18:40.662
I'm on the rooster.

18:40.913 --> 18:44.541
This team has completely
lost its focus.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.130
You think April is too early
for a Roger Dorn night?

18:50.255 --> 18:52.090
Ahh...

18:52.216 --> 18:55.385
Uh, Lou-
Oh, hi, Roger.

18:55.427 --> 18:58.055
I just want to say
I think carrying three catchers

18:58.138 --> 19:00.933
is probably
a good idea.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.311
Hold it a second,
Jake.

19:04.436 --> 19:08.941
Jake, you're a very valuable part
of this organization.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.651
The way you helped that kid
with his problem-

19:10.943 --> 19:13.529
that was, uh, impressive.

19:13.612 --> 19:15.155
Well, he's got some talent.

19:15.239 --> 19:17.241
I guess with a little patience,
he might even become a ball player.

19:17.366 --> 19:20.035
What Dorn's trying
to say,Jake,

19:20.118 --> 19:23.580
is we're not carrying
three catchers.

19:23.705 --> 19:27.167
We'd like you
to stay on as a coach.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.919
We're gonna need you.

19:32.965 --> 19:35.926
You'll make
a great coach,Jake.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.346
Dorn, I'm not a coach,
I'm a ball player.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.348
Why don't you just find
some poor schmuck

19:41.473 --> 19:42.933
with his belly hanging
over his belt

19:43.016 --> 19:46.979
and pastrami sticking
out of his mouth?

19:47.104 --> 19:49.439
I'm done with baseball.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.863
Called everywhere.
Nobody's looking for

19:55.988 --> 20:00.117
a 41-year-old
catcherwith bad knees.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.619
It's not like you don't
have other options.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.622
Alan Bellows wants you
to join his brokerage firm.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.377
And Jack Pursoff
wants me to head up

20:10.502 --> 20:12.087
one of his Pepsi
distributorships.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.881
And you'd be
close to home.

20:14.006 --> 20:18.343
Yeah, and I'd make a hell of a lot
more money than I would as a coach.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.346
So what ifl never made it
to a World Series.

20:21.430 --> 20:25.893
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what you ought to do.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.907
Uh...

20:43.327 --> 20:46.205
I'll tell Dorn I begged you
to come back.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.668
Thanks, Skip.

20:55.589 --> 20:56.548
Hey.

20:56.590 --> 20:57.674
How you doing?

20:57.883 --> 20:59.885
Hola, how you doing, man?

20:59.927 --> 21:01.512
How you doing?

21:01.637 --> 21:04.348
Alright. Alright.
Alright.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.017
Hi, Flan.
How are you?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.353
I hope you don't mind,
but I've set up a photo op

21:09.436 --> 21:10.604
with an inner-city
youth group.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.022
You mean a gang?

21:12.105 --> 21:13.357
No problem,
I used to be in one.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.942
Actually, I was in four or five.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.860
No, darling.
These are first-time offenders

21:16.944 --> 21:18.445
they're trying
to keep out of gangs.

21:18.570 --> 21:19.530
All you have to do is

21:19.613 --> 21:21.573
pose with one
of the juvenile hall kids

21:21.657 --> 21:22.950
and the education director.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.287
Do we really have
to do this now?

21:27.412 --> 21:29.081
Are you kidding?

21:29.206 --> 21:31.250
It doesn't hurt to show you have
a social conscience,

21:31.375 --> 21:33.877
that you're giving something back
to the community.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.296
You'll be fine.

21:43.387 --> 21:44.263
Hi, Rick.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.515
Nikki, how are you?

21:46.598 --> 21:49.059
Fine.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.478
This is Frankie.
He's one of my students.

21:51.603 --> 21:54.982
He won room inspection five days
in a row to be in this picture.

21:55.107 --> 21:57.150
You could eat prime rib
off my floor.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.570
Way to go, Frankie.

21:59.653 --> 22:02.197
Just a minute, Rick.
He has a problem with his flash.

22:02.281 --> 22:04.491
Is that your new girlfriend?

22:04.575 --> 22:07.077
Yeah. She's also my agent.

22:07.161 --> 22:10.038
Major babe.

22:10.122 --> 22:13.041
Does she like riding
on your Harley?

22:13.125 --> 22:14.251
Is this thing gonna
happen orwhat?

22:14.334 --> 22:15.419
Ready to go.

22:17.462 --> 22:20.048
Don't tell me
you sold the Harley.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.092
Flannery has
been great for me.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.927
I'm not the bum
I used to be.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.888
I kind of liked
the bum you used to be.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.306
OK, that's it.
Thanks a lot.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.932
Great.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.851
Take care, Frankie.

22:30.976 --> 22:32.060
So long, kids.

22:32.144 --> 22:33.103
Bye! See you!

22:33.187 --> 22:34.980
See you, Nikki.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.481
Hey, uh, Rick?

22:36.607 --> 22:38.400
I thought you might
want this back.

22:38.483 --> 22:41.153
You left it
at my apartment.

22:44.072 --> 22:48.619
I don't have much use
for it now, but thanks.

22:48.911 --> 22:50.370
See you, Rick.

22:52.122 --> 22:54.500
So long, Nikki.

23:01.173 --> 23:03.175
Come on.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.679
Alrighty, folks,
I'd have to say my next guest

23:07.930 --> 23:09.973
is about the closest thing
baseball has to a rock star.

23:10.057 --> 23:12.059
Please welcome,
from the Cleveland indians

23:12.184 --> 23:14.019
Rick "The Wild Thing" Vaughn.

23:28.492 --> 23:30.452
Now, let's get
right to it here.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.496
This whole
"Wild Thing" label

23:32.579 --> 23:34.373
that you've been
saddled with

23:34.498 --> 23:37.084
this has led a lot
of people to believe

23:37.209 --> 23:39.586
that, like, you're
borderline scary

23:39.711 --> 23:41.338
like, you're a psycho-guy,
but you seem pretty straight.

23:41.463 --> 23:42.965
Yeah.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.967
So where does this
reputation come from?

23:45.050 --> 23:47.511
From what I've read
you were mixed-up as a kid

23:47.594 --> 23:50.639
with the cops- is that something
you want to talk about?

23:50.889 --> 23:53.058
- No.
- Sure.

23:53.183 --> 23:56.979
I saw this new Corvette.
Took it for a drive.

23:57.062 --> 23:59.356
Just kind of boys-being-boys
kind of thing.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.108
Through four states.

24:01.233 --> 24:04.528
Four states?
That's a lot.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.405
It ended
in a high-speed chase.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.867
Up there around 140
orso.

24:09.950 --> 24:13.287
When I got out of the car,
the cop had a real attitude.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.331
Theywere gonna throw
the book at me

24:16.415 --> 24:17.958
but my cousin dates a judge
in Colorado.

24:19.251 --> 24:20.878
He's a transvestite.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.091
The judge or your cousin?

24:26.216 --> 24:28.385
The judge.

24:28.427 --> 24:31.555
Oh! Um, let's take
a little break.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.224
More with, uh, Rick,
right after this.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.441
It's cool, it's overcast,

24:42.566 --> 24:43.525
and it's foggy...

24:43.609 --> 24:45.986
on opening day
here in Cleveland.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.988
Hello again, everyone.
I'm Harry Doyle

24:48.071 --> 24:51.325
along with my good friend
and partner Monte what's-his-name,

24:51.408 --> 24:54.578
giving a big Wahoo welcome
to all the Cleveland faithful.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.289
It's a brand-new season
and a new team spirit

24:57.414 --> 24:59.458
as novice owner Roger Dorn

24:59.583 --> 25:02.586
has made two very savvy
front-office moves-

25:02.878 --> 25:05.506
acquiring free-agent
sluggerJack Parkman

25:05.631 --> 25:07.466
and announcing
his own retirement,

25:07.591 --> 25:10.093
eliminating a huge hole
at third base.

25:10.177 --> 25:12.930
Hell, no. Not a great spring-
3 and 24.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.432
Sowhat? They had a bad spring.

25:15.516 --> 25:17.351
They did the same
thing lastyear.

25:17.476 --> 25:21.104
The important thing is that Parkman
and Hayes are killing the ball.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.524
Cerrano, he's lying
in the weeds.

25:23.607 --> 25:26.026
Vaughn, he's off
to a slow start,

25:26.109 --> 25:27.653
but look out.

25:27.903 --> 25:28.820
They're going to erupt.

25:28.904 --> 25:30.030
They're gonna bust loose.

25:30.155 --> 25:33.116
They're gonna do it.
They're gonna bust loose.

25:33.242 --> 25:34.618
They're a powder keg.
Juggernaut.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.330
Getting close now,

25:38.413 --> 25:39.998
as the Indians begin
their drive

25:40.123 --> 25:41.542
for a world championship

25:41.667 --> 25:43.961
against the hated
Chicago White Sox,

25:44.044 --> 25:45.379
who swept the Tribe

25:45.504 --> 25:48.465
right out of
the playoffs lastyear.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.300
And listen to the roar
of the crowd

25:50.425 --> 25:53.345
as the Indians
take the field.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.562
Mow 'em down,
Wild Thing!

26:03.564 --> 26:04.857
Did you ever have
that feeling

26:04.940 --> 26:08.652
you were just born
for greatness?

26:10.195 --> 26:12.447
RickVaughn
gets the starting call today.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.867
We're told he matured
a lot over the winter.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.493
Apparently,
he's bathing now.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.162
Congratulations, Rick.

26:18.287 --> 26:21.081
As you know, Monte, Vaughn's been
working on a couple of new pitches-

26:21.206 --> 26:23.250
The Eliminator
and The Humiliator-

26:23.375 --> 26:25.335
to complement his fastball,
The Terminator.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.628
I heard that.

26:26.879 --> 26:28.922
Dynamite drop-in,
Monte.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.966
That broadcast school
has really paid off.

26:31.049 --> 26:32.593
We're ready for the opening pitch.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.595
Vaughn winds and fires.

26:34.887 --> 26:37.347
It's a strike.
And we're underway.

26:37.472 --> 26:40.184
Alright, Rickey!
Good job. Great pitch, man.

26:40.267 --> 26:42.102
Great pitch.
Do it again!

26:42.227 --> 26:45.063
Come on. Let's see it.
Guywas toast.

26:45.105 --> 26:47.065
Yeah?

26:48.317 --> 26:50.277
Vaugh winds
for the 0-2 pitch.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.237
Called strike 3!

26:52.321 --> 26:54.239
Called strike 6!

26:54.323 --> 26:56.950
Called strike 9!
Inning over!

26:57.034 --> 26:59.077
Yeah!
Alright!

26:59.203 --> 27:01.079
Break out
the champagne!

27:01.163 --> 27:02.664
It's in the bag.

27:02.915 --> 27:06.084
The fat lady has
left the building!

27:06.210 --> 27:08.086
So Vaughn sets down
the White Sox

27:08.170 --> 27:09.421
in the top of the first.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.340
Willie Mays Hayes
steps in.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.175
Hayes had a great spring,

27:13.258 --> 27:15.177
adding the long ball
to his speed.

27:15.260 --> 27:20.057
Now batting... double 0-
Willie Mays Hayes.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.976
Willie swinging
his shillelagh at the plate.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.229
And Hayes
is calling his shot!

27:25.312 --> 27:27.981
He's pointing toward
the left field bleachers.

27:28.106 --> 27:30.442
Alright, Willie!
Right here, Willie!

27:30.526 --> 27:32.361
What's he pointing at?

27:32.444 --> 27:34.863
What? Does he know
someone up there?

27:36.657 --> 27:38.325
Hayes ready
at the plate!

27:38.408 --> 27:40.160
Alaino into his windup
and the pitch.

27:40.244 --> 27:42.412
Here's a swing and a drive
to left and deep.

27:42.496 --> 27:45.499
Way back... Belmonti racing
toward the wall.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.251
This one has a chance.

27:47.376 --> 27:49.086
It's going... going...

27:49.169 --> 27:52.422
not quite gone.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.007
Heh heh.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.092
That had to be the wind.

27:55.175 --> 27:57.469
It must've been the wind.

27:57.553 --> 27:59.137
Top of the 3rd now.

27:59.263 --> 28:00.597
Vaughn's been in trouble
a couple of times,

28:00.639 --> 28:02.599
but has held
the White Sox

28:02.683 --> 28:04.518
with his new assortment
of breaking stuff.

28:04.643 --> 28:07.563
Humiliator lined to left,
a base hit.

28:09.648 --> 28:13.986
Eliminator lined to right,
another base hit.

28:14.069 --> 28:17.573
There's some real puss
lined to center.

28:17.656 --> 28:19.867
Termini's
coming around third.

28:19.992 --> 28:20.993
The throw
is cut off.

28:21.118 --> 28:22.286
He'll score.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.329
And it's 1-0,
White Sox.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.168
What?

28:29.293 --> 28:30.169
What?

28:30.294 --> 28:31.670
They're hammering
this slow crap.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.256
Think your arm
could stand the strain

28:34.339 --> 28:35.549
of throwing this guy
a fastball?

28:35.674 --> 28:38.302
Look, I'll throw it.
You just make sure you catch it.

28:38.427 --> 28:41.513
I will if
it ever gets to me.

28:41.638 --> 28:43.974
God knows what Vaughn's
going to throw next.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.851
He's running out of names.

28:45.934 --> 28:47.394
That'll bring up
Hank Shaw,

28:47.519 --> 28:50.480
who led the Sox in home runs
and RBIs lastyear.

28:50.564 --> 28:53.358
I don't know how this guy keeps
his mind on baseball,

28:53.400 --> 28:55.402
what, with all
the paternity suits and all.

28:55.527 --> 28:56.862
I think those are
parking tickets.

28:56.945 --> 28:57.863
Yeah.

29:00.365 --> 29:03.035
Vaughn has his
sign and comes set,

29:03.160 --> 29:05.078
checks the runner
at second.

29:05.204 --> 29:06.371
Here's the pitch
to Shaw.

29:06.497 --> 29:09.249
Swung on and belted
into deep right field.

29:09.374 --> 29:11.335
Back goes Cerrano.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.420
He'll need a rocket up his ass
to catch this one.

29:13.545 --> 29:15.672
That baby is out of here.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.049
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

29:17.174 --> 29:19.551
That looked like
The Terminator, only slower.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.553
Maybe it was
his Out-Of-Stater,

29:21.678 --> 29:23.388
or it could've been
The Hibernator.

29:23.514 --> 29:26.391
That baby is definitely
going away for the winter.

29:26.475 --> 29:28.060
Whatever forVaughn,

29:28.185 --> 29:30.062
it might be
see-you-later.

29:30.187 --> 29:33.023
He's probably going
to become a... spectator.

29:35.359 --> 29:38.111
Didn't have much
on that one.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.906
4-0, Chicago.
Hayes at the plate.

29:40.989 --> 29:43.075
And he's calling it again!

29:45.244 --> 29:47.621
Come on, Willie!
This time for sure!

29:47.704 --> 29:50.457
Aw, forget that!
Put the ball on the ground!

29:53.085 --> 29:55.003
Alaino looking
in for the sign

29:55.087 --> 29:57.464
and goes into
his windup.

29:57.589 --> 29:59.883
Here's the swing
and a drive to deep left.

29:59.967 --> 30:01.426
It could go this time!

30:01.552 --> 30:03.554
Yes! Yes!

30:03.637 --> 30:06.431
Belmonti back
to the wall again. Way back!

30:06.515 --> 30:08.392
Come on!
Come to papa!

30:08.475 --> 30:10.018
And it is...

30:10.102 --> 30:11.103
Come to papa!

30:11.186 --> 30:13.605
Caught!

30:13.689 --> 30:16.233
You were lucky, Belmonti!

30:16.358 --> 30:18.861
Of course, he could be pointing
at the left fielder.

30:22.239 --> 30:26.827
Bottom of the 6th. Jack Parkman
stepping in with runners at the corners.

30:26.952 --> 30:29.204
Parkman with two hits
already today.

30:29.288 --> 30:31.999
Martinez leads away
from first,

30:32.124 --> 30:34.168
Warren from third.

30:34.251 --> 30:36.295
Parkman doing
his little shimmy.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.964
It drives the women here
in Cleveland crazy.

30:39.089 --> 30:42.176
Vargas, the little left-hander,
set at the belt.

30:42.301 --> 30:43.969
Here's the pitch.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.930
Parkman swings and drives
one to deep left center.

30:46.972 --> 30:49.308
It looks like
he got it all!

30:49.391 --> 30:51.268
It is good-bye,
Mr. Rawlings!

30:51.351 --> 30:55.189
And the Indians
pull to within 1 at 4-3.

30:57.441 --> 31:00.444
Way to go,Jack!
I bought him.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.988
Welcome
to NewJack City!

31:03.113 --> 31:04.490
I told you this guy
would make a difference.

31:10.662 --> 31:13.290
- Jacksonville!
- Jack the Ripper!

31:13.415 --> 31:16.460
- Jumpin'Jack Flash!
- Jack attack!

31:16.585 --> 31:19.129
I used to hate Parkman
when he was with the A's.

31:19.213 --> 31:22.841
It's amazing how a new uniform
can change your attitude about a guy.

31:24.343 --> 31:26.470
He's still a Dick.

31:33.185 --> 31:34.394
Last of the 9th.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.230
2 outs and a tying run
at first,

31:36.355 --> 31:38.899
and Pedro Cerrano
steps into the box.

31:39.024 --> 31:40.484
Cerrano hitless today

31:40.567 --> 31:43.111
and pretty much
all spring.

31:43.195 --> 31:45.531
Martinez takes his lead
from first again.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.035
Here's the pitch.

31:50.118 --> 31:53.914
Cerrano swings, and it's a high fly ball
to center field.

31:53.997 --> 31:56.291
And it hits a bird!

31:56.375 --> 31:57.626
The ball drops
into right,

31:57.709 --> 31:59.169
the bird
into short center.

31:59.211 --> 32:01.296
Cerrano rounds first

32:01.380 --> 32:04.132
and heads for...
center field?

32:04.216 --> 32:05.634
Where are you going?

32:07.302 --> 32:10.389
Cerrano kill
a living thing.

32:10.514 --> 32:11.473
Forget the damn bird!
Run! Run!

32:13.058 --> 32:15.894
He's alive. Ha ha!

32:15.936 --> 32:18.438
Martinez around third,
heading for home,

32:18.564 --> 32:19.523
and so is the bird.

32:19.648 --> 32:20.566
Bye-bye, birdie.

32:20.649 --> 32:23.193
I'm sorry,
but you're out, Mr. Gandhi.

32:24.528 --> 32:28.115
Too late! Run doesn't score!
Ballgame's over!

32:28.240 --> 32:29.616
What?

32:29.908 --> 32:31.952
Cerrano, come on!

32:33.704 --> 32:35.455
Well, the Indians
drop a tough one.

32:35.581 --> 32:39.042
4-3, as Pedro Cerrano
doubles off a pigeon

32:39.126 --> 32:40.919
and then is tagged out,

32:41.044 --> 32:42.212
administering CPR

32:42.296 --> 32:44.882
before the tying run
could score.

32:44.965 --> 32:46.341
It's a funny game,
eh, Monte?

32:46.425 --> 32:47.593
Well, at least
the bird survived.

32:47.885 --> 32:50.971
Who cares?
It's a rat with wings.

32:51.096 --> 32:52.181
Two months.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.475
Two months?

32:55.601 --> 32:58.937
What do you mean
two months?

32:58.979 --> 33:00.939
You have enough money to run
the team for two months.

33:01.064 --> 33:02.608
You paid too much
for the franchise.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.277
There's another four
months in the season.

33:05.402 --> 33:07.404
What am I supposed to do?

33:07.529 --> 33:09.615
Increase your profits
any way you can.

33:15.913 --> 33:18.207
Well, fans, Roger Dorn
has done a little redecorating

33:18.290 --> 33:19.500
around the ballpark.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.461
The outfield walls now
look like the Yellow Pages.

33:22.544 --> 33:25.589
And any of you folks having trouble
finding a good proctologist

33:25.881 --> 33:28.467
might want to come down here
and check out the area

33:28.592 --> 33:31.637
around
the 375-foot sign.

33:31.929 --> 33:33.305
As for the game,

33:33.347 --> 33:35.557
we got a real nail-biter
here tonight.

33:35.641 --> 33:38.560
It's a lot closer
than that 11-2 score.

33:48.028 --> 33:50.489
Mr. Vaughn! I thought
you were starting tonight.

33:50.572 --> 33:52.991
- I did.
- Oh. sorry.

33:53.075 --> 33:55.327
I didn't turn it on
till the second inning.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.046
I can't believe
you're so upset

34:06.171 --> 34:07.589
about what
the valet said.

34:07.673 --> 34:08.924
I'm upset
because Billy Ritter

34:09.007 --> 34:10.300
hit a 3-run homer
off me.

34:10.384 --> 34:13.136
He was due.
I mean, it's amazing.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.179
The man has been in the majors
for seven years,

34:15.304 --> 34:16.473
and he's never
hit a home run.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.934
Never?

34:19.016 --> 34:20.643
I thought you knew.

34:20.853 --> 34:22.938
Oh.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.940
May be you should throw fastballs
more often

34:25.023 --> 34:26.275
till you're sure of
your other pitches.

34:26.358 --> 34:27.484
I did that tonight.

34:27.568 --> 34:29.652
I threw Ritter
an 87 mile-an-hour fastball,

34:29.902 --> 34:31.029
and he crushed it.

34:31.155 --> 34:33.322
Lastyear,
I averaged 96.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.951
Now I reach back,
and it's just not there.

34:36.034 --> 34:39.079
I can't believe it.
I've forgotten how to throw heat.

34:41.206 --> 34:42.331
Look...

34:42.416 --> 34:44.418
you'll make
a few adjustments.

34:44.543 --> 34:46.003
In a week or two,

34:46.085 --> 34:47.337
you'll be laughing
about this.

34:47.420 --> 34:50.007
And don't worry
about the endorsements.

34:55.554 --> 34:59.183
It's not your E.R.A.
they're going to be worried about.

34:59.266 --> 35:02.227
It's your image
that's important-

35:02.311 --> 35:04.855
wholesome...

35:04.938 --> 35:07.191
clean-cut...

35:07.274 --> 35:09.943
All-American.

35:18.410 --> 35:19.453
While on
the croquet lawn,

35:19.578 --> 35:22.122
one must be careful not
to offend one's opponent

35:22.247 --> 35:26.210
with an onset
of unwanted odor.

35:26.293 --> 35:27.836
Oh, bully!

35:27.920 --> 35:30.339
That's why I use
Right Guard Sport Stick,

35:30.422 --> 35:32.966
maximum protection
against odicious,

35:33.091 --> 35:34.635
odorophously...

35:34.927 --> 35:36.845
olflacty manations.

35:36.929 --> 35:39.389
Cut! Let's just cut that.

35:39.473 --> 35:40.849
Um, it's odiously...

35:40.933 --> 35:42.226
odiferous...

35:42.309 --> 35:44.478
olfactory emanations.

35:44.603 --> 35:50.234
Right.

35:50.359 --> 35:51.276
Odoroforous...

35:51.360 --> 35:53.612
ofolactory...
emaranations.

35:53.654 --> 35:55.572
Odorforous...

35:55.656 --> 35:56.615

35:56.865 --> 35:59.117

35:59.201 --> 36:01.119

36:11.255 --> 36:14.258
Whoa,
boom bapa boom

36:14.383 --> 36:17.469
Whoa,
boom bapa boom

36:17.594 --> 36:20.472
Whoa, boom

36:20.597 --> 36:23.892
So Weaver doubles off
the Zippo Bail Bond sign.

36:23.976 --> 36:26.311
And that's another team record
for RickVaughn,

36:26.395 --> 36:29.314
the fifth consecutive
extra base hit in the inning.

36:32.025 --> 36:35.320
And he's out by an eyelash
at third.

36:35.404 --> 36:39.533
Cerrano doing some interesting
limbering-up exercises in right.

36:39.658 --> 36:41.160
What a pansy.

36:42.578 --> 36:45.289
Here's a fly ball
hit to right.

36:45.372 --> 36:48.125
Easy play for Cerrano,
under it now, and makes the-

36:48.208 --> 36:52.004
No! That ball is off his glove
and outta here!

36:53.547 --> 36:55.924
Well, credit Cerrano
with an RBI.

36:56.008 --> 36:58.135
And that play could
be a finalist

36:58.177 --> 37:01.096
in the Trojan Ends
"Boner of the Week" award.

37:05.517 --> 37:07.853
Take 87.

37:07.936 --> 37:09.396
And action!

37:09.521 --> 37:11.398
Right Guard
Sport Stick.

37:13.358 --> 37:14.485
Anything less...

37:17.237 --> 37:19.573
would be uncivilized.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.828
Upside down.

37:24.953 --> 37:27.080
Upside down.

37:27.206 --> 37:29.541
Thank you. Cut!

37:37.090 --> 37:39.551
Hey, Rick! Is it true
you're moving to the bull pen?

37:39.635 --> 37:40.969
Of course not.

37:41.053 --> 37:43.388
Where do you guys
get this stuff?

37:47.476 --> 37:49.937
Hey, Wild Thing!

37:50.062 --> 37:51.396
Don't worry.
You're still the best.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.607
You stunk at the beginning
of lastyear, too.

37:53.899 --> 37:55.359
Thanks, Frankie.

37:55.442 --> 37:57.903
We don't believe what they say
about you in the papers-

37:57.986 --> 38:00.239
You know, that you're a fluke
and all that stuff.

38:00.322 --> 38:02.366
And that you lost
your fastball.

38:02.449 --> 38:03.534
And that you got
no heart.

38:03.659 --> 38:06.078
You guys want an autograph
or something?

38:06.161 --> 38:09.122
Yeah, that'd be great.
Hey, Nikki!

38:09.206 --> 38:10.624
You got something
Vaughn can sign?

38:16.213 --> 38:17.881
Hi, Rick.

38:18.006 --> 38:18.924
Hi.

38:23.512 --> 38:24.888
Listen, I was
real sorry to hear

38:24.930 --> 38:26.265
they took you
out of the rotation.

38:26.390 --> 38:29.226
It's only temporary.

38:29.309 --> 38:31.103
You're in a slump.
You'll bounce back.

38:31.228 --> 38:32.521
Yeah.

38:36.483 --> 38:39.361
Well, we better get back.

38:41.113 --> 38:44.950
Hey... Nikki!

38:45.033 --> 38:48.370
I'm sorry I didn't call you
after last season.

38:48.453 --> 38:49.830
It's for the best.

38:49.955 --> 38:52.207
We've both moved on
to better things.

38:52.291 --> 38:53.834
You seeing anybody?

38:53.959 --> 38:55.836
Yeah, yeah.

38:55.961 --> 38:58.547
This'll crack you up.
He's from Chicago.

38:58.630 --> 39:01.633
Big White Sox fan.
Boy, does he hate you.

39:06.305 --> 39:08.432
Good luck, Rick.

39:08.515 --> 39:10.434
Thanks.

39:20.277 --> 39:21.653
What a great woman.

39:21.904 --> 39:24.823
She's a White Sox fan!

39:24.907 --> 39:26.575
Such a nice personality.

39:26.658 --> 39:27.868
I bet he loves
the idea of me

39:27.993 --> 39:29.244
sitting out here
in the bullpen.

39:29.328 --> 39:30.287
Really sexy, too.

39:30.370 --> 39:31.288
I've met the woman,
Rube,

39:31.371 --> 39:32.998
I don't need
a description, alright?

39:33.123 --> 39:36.001
A White Sox fan.

39:38.504 --> 39:39.922
Women...

39:40.005 --> 39:43.342
you can't live without them,
and they can't pee standing up.

39:48.096 --> 39:50.098
Well, fans, the Indians
about to extend

39:50.182 --> 39:52.309
theirwinning streak to...

39:52.351 --> 39:53.477
two!

39:53.560 --> 39:55.145
This is it!

39:55.229 --> 39:56.438
Vaughn's
coming out of it.

39:56.522 --> 39:57.940
I know he's
coming out of it.

39:58.023 --> 39:59.399
This demotion
to the bull pen

39:59.525 --> 40:00.859
has got to have been
a wake-up call.

40:00.984 --> 40:02.361
Ring Ring!
Rise and shine, Ricky!

40:02.486 --> 40:04.530
This is the day
we turn it around.

40:04.655 --> 40:06.156
Flip it over.

40:06.281 --> 40:07.407
We're in
the top of the 9th.

40:07.533 --> 40:10.452
Leading 10-7.
Bases loaded. 2 down.

40:10.536 --> 40:13.330
RickVaughn has come on
to try and nail it down

40:13.413 --> 40:15.415
against Felipe Aguilar,

40:15.541 --> 40:18.168
a dangerous
right-handed batter.

40:18.293 --> 40:19.878
Here's the pitch!

40:20.003 --> 40:21.171
Oh, shit!

40:21.296 --> 40:24.216
- Alright! - Hot
dog! - No, no!

40:24.341 --> 40:26.301
If that's not Shaquille O'Neal
in left,

40:26.385 --> 40:27.845
that baby's outta here.

40:27.886 --> 40:30.222
Oh, no!

40:30.347 --> 40:32.266
You rotten mugs!

40:32.391 --> 40:34.977
You overpaid weenies!

40:36.186 --> 40:37.354
Wild Thing,

40:37.437 --> 40:39.523
you make my butt sting!

40:39.606 --> 40:41.441
I detest you!

40:41.567 --> 40:43.026
You're all garbage!

40:43.152 --> 40:44.570
All of you!

40:44.653 --> 40:48.073
Back up the truck!
Back it up!

40:48.157 --> 40:50.284
Jack, being new to the club,

40:50.409 --> 40:52.244
how do you feel about the way
things have gone

40:52.327 --> 40:53.912
for the Indians
so far?

40:53.996 --> 40:55.205
I'm the onlywinner
on the team.

40:55.289 --> 40:57.040
The rest of them
are losers,

40:57.124 --> 40:59.042
either by choice
or by birth.

41:01.378 --> 41:03.922
You think you can help me
with my fastball, doc?

41:04.047 --> 41:06.592
We'll have to deal
with some deeper issues first.

41:06.884 --> 41:08.385
I don't have
any deeper issues.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.512
I like to keep things
right on the surface.

41:10.596 --> 41:13.932
Well, sometimes,
there are little surprises.

41:14.016 --> 41:16.852
Tell me, Rick, what goes
through your mind

41:16.935 --> 41:19.354
when you throw
your fastball?

41:19.438 --> 41:21.106
I wonder if it's
going to end up

41:21.231 --> 41:23.275
in some guy's den.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.194
Did you used
to think this way?

41:25.277 --> 41:28.280
I didn't used to think at all.
Takes a lot out of you.

41:28.405 --> 41:32.534
Well, then, Rick.
Let's get down to it.

41:32.618 --> 41:36.038
The real problem here goes back
to when you stole that car.

41:36.121 --> 41:39.458
You wanted to be caught,
didn't you? Punished.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.085
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have thrown

41:42.211 --> 41:43.462
the 0-2 fastball to fields
when everybody knows

41:43.587 --> 41:45.923
he'll chase the two-strike
curveball in the dirt.

41:46.006 --> 41:47.549
I'd already thrown him
two curveballs

41:47.633 --> 41:49.927
the second one he hit
436 feet foul.

41:50.010 --> 41:52.304
Better than 520 feet fair.

41:57.226 --> 41:58.268
Parkman.

41:58.352 --> 41:59.603
I saw your
little interview

41:59.645 --> 42:01.146
in this morning's paper.

42:01.230 --> 42:02.898
You're benched
for two games.

42:02.981 --> 42:04.149
If you ever rip
any of your teammates-

42:04.274 --> 42:05.609
Save your breath.

42:05.859 --> 42:07.110
What did you say?

42:07.194 --> 42:09.446
You ought to listen
to the radio more, Lou.

42:09.530 --> 42:12.241
Your biggest gun just got traded
to Chicago,

42:12.324 --> 42:14.326
as a matter of fact,
your only gun.

42:17.496 --> 42:19.873
Au revoir.

42:22.084 --> 42:25.587
How could you sell
my best playerwithout asking me?

42:25.671 --> 42:27.381
I'm on my ass.

42:27.506 --> 42:29.216
I'm tapped out.

42:29.341 --> 42:31.635
I'm not going to be able
to make next month's payroll.

42:31.885 --> 42:35.639
Aw... jeez.

42:35.889 --> 42:37.516
But I didn't sell
Parkman outright.

42:37.641 --> 42:39.935
I got you
an outfielder.

42:40.018 --> 42:42.187
He used to play
with the Giants.

42:44.231 --> 42:45.524
Franklin?

42:47.359 --> 42:49.111
Not those Giants.

42:58.704 --> 43:01.582
And, so,
Hiroshi "Kamikaze" Tanaka,

43:01.874 --> 43:04.084
recently
of the Tokyo Giants,

43:04.168 --> 43:07.129
knocks himself cold
for the second time this week.

43:07.212 --> 43:10.549
Maybe in Japan, that's actually better
than catching the ball.

43:10.632 --> 43:14.303
Personally, I think he's trying
to get out of the lineup.

43:20.184 --> 43:23.604
Om.

43:41.497 --> 43:44.875
Pedro Cerrano.
How you doing?

43:44.958 --> 43:47.085
Who your master?

43:47.211 --> 43:48.629
My master?

43:48.921 --> 43:50.839
It's the great
Hama Masasuri.

43:54.176 --> 43:55.636
Thank you.

43:55.928 --> 43:58.263
A ball player
must be a warrior...

43:58.388 --> 44:01.433
not a monk!

44:01.558 --> 44:03.519
Hyah!

44:14.530 --> 44:18.033
Alright, you guys.
Let's listen up.

44:18.116 --> 44:20.202
We won a gameyesterday.

44:20.285 --> 44:21.829
If we win one today,

44:21.954 --> 44:24.206
that's two in a row.

44:24.289 --> 44:26.041
If we win one tomorrow,

44:26.124 --> 44:28.377
that's called
a winning streak.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.879
It has happened before.

44:30.963 --> 44:32.923
So let's see some hustle!

44:32.965 --> 44:34.925
Let's jack it up
a little.

44:35.008 --> 44:38.095
I got a feeling things
are about to turn around for us.

44:38.220 --> 44:40.138
Oh, my God.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.851
Hello, boys.

44:43.976 --> 44:45.435
You don't mind
if come in

44:45.561 --> 44:47.980
and visit with you
for a moment, do you?

44:48.105 --> 44:50.399
This clubhouse is off limits
to everyone

44:50.482 --> 44:52.609
but Indian personnel.

44:52.860 --> 44:55.612
That does include
the owner, doesn't it?

44:55.863 --> 44:56.822
What?

44:56.947 --> 44:58.991
I just bought the team back
this morning

44:59.074 --> 45:00.826
at a substantial prof it.

45:00.909 --> 45:04.037
I retained Roger here
as the general manager.

45:04.163 --> 45:06.832
But the money really
means little to me.

45:06.957 --> 45:08.542
I have more than enough.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.461
This...
is more personal.

45:13.297 --> 45:17.384
Lastyear,
by some impossible fluke...

45:17.509 --> 45:20.429
you ruined
a beautiful dream.

45:20.512 --> 45:23.974
Now, you're going
down in flames,

45:24.016 --> 45:28.520
and I want to be there
when you go splat.

45:28.645 --> 45:31.023
Keep up
the good work, gents.

45:31.148 --> 45:32.316
Miss Phelps...

45:46.413 --> 45:47.581
Oh.

45:54.254 --> 45:56.507
You...

45:59.218 --> 46:03.180
Come on, you're not going
to let her get you down, are you?

46:03.263 --> 46:06.350
You guys won last year
just to spite her.

46:06.433 --> 46:09.019
Maybe she's
just what we need.

46:09.144 --> 46:12.231
Aw, Skip, theywere
a different team last year.

46:12.356 --> 46:13.315
Taylor!

46:13.398 --> 46:16.235
It's not your job
to make excuses.

46:16.318 --> 46:18.862
That's all you guys
do good!

46:18.987 --> 46:22.032
It's either a leg thing...

46:22.115 --> 46:24.284
or a spiritual thing...

46:24.409 --> 46:27.079
or a psychological thing!

46:27.204 --> 46:29.206
Or a heart attack!

46:29.289 --> 46:31.124
Who used heart attack?

46:31.250 --> 46:34.169
Me.

46:34.253 --> 46:35.295
Hey!

46:36.505 --> 46:39.383
Doctors say I got
to take some time off,

46:39.424 --> 46:43.178
so I want you to manage the team
for the rest of the year.

46:43.262 --> 46:46.056
You got to be kidding, Lou.

46:46.139 --> 46:48.183
I don't have any experience
managing.

46:48.267 --> 46:51.603
Ah, you're one of the smartest players
I ever coached.

46:51.645 --> 46:54.606
Guys all look up to you.

46:54.648 --> 46:57.985
Tell Dorn
you'll take the job.

46:58.110 --> 46:59.945
Look on
the bright side-

47:00.070 --> 47:02.364
things couldn't get
anyworse.

47:04.032 --> 47:05.075
Hey, guys.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.161
I got some good news
for you.

47:07.286 --> 47:09.580
This morning
at 9: 10 a. m...

47:09.663 --> 47:12.374
I activated myself.

47:16.003 --> 47:18.088
What you doin'? Schoup.

47:18.172 --> 47:19.882
Hey.

47:19.965 --> 47:22.384
What is this?

47:27.055 --> 47:28.265
впQue es eso?

47:28.307 --> 47:32.269
Buddha, samurai, OK.

47:32.352 --> 47:34.605
Peaceful inside.

47:34.897 --> 47:36.440
Outside, warrior.

47:44.531 --> 47:47.159
I love you, man.

47:47.284 --> 47:49.620
I love you too much.

47:53.123 --> 47:56.335
You know,
you have no...

47:58.295 --> 48:00.506
you have no...

48:02.257 --> 48:05.385
marbles!

48:05.511 --> 48:06.845
Marbles?

48:06.929 --> 48:09.973
Marbles! You have no marbles!

48:12.559 --> 48:15.145
Hey, relax.

48:15.270 --> 48:17.397
Marbles?

48:17.523 --> 48:18.398
Marbles!

48:33.205 --> 48:34.832
Hello, Tribe fans.

48:34.957 --> 48:36.875
Welcome back
to major league baseball...

48:36.959 --> 48:38.377
sort of.

48:38.502 --> 48:40.879
Paid attendance today is...

48:40.963 --> 48:43.006
1,412.

48:43.090 --> 48:44.550
Some of them
were driven away

48:44.675 --> 48:48.303
by that little 10-run 1st inning
the Red Sox put up.

48:50.055 --> 48:52.015
Take over, Monte.

48:52.057 --> 48:54.476
I'm in the bag.

48:56.186 --> 48:58.522
Me?

49:01.066 --> 49:03.193
Fly ball...

49:05.112 --> 49:06.071
caught.

49:07.573 --> 49:10.200
I can't believe we gotta play
a doubleheader.

49:10.284 --> 49:13.620
Let's get going.
Come on, let's get something started.

49:13.912 --> 49:16.290
It's okay, Pedro.
The guy made a great play.

49:16.415 --> 49:17.332
Tough luck, man.

49:17.416 --> 49:20.043
Come on. Look alive.

49:20.127 --> 49:21.295
Uh-uh-uh, Vaughn,

49:21.420 --> 49:23.172
shouldn't you get
to the bull pen?

49:23.255 --> 49:24.173
Right now?

49:24.256 --> 49:25.215
Yeah.

49:27.593 --> 49:29.219
There's still somebody
in the bleachers.

49:29.303 --> 49:31.555
Who cares?
Go on. Get out there.

49:36.602 --> 49:38.979
Fan: Hey, Vile Thing!

49:39.104 --> 49:43.025
I think I loathe you!

49:43.108 --> 49:46.862
You didn't think I'd abandon you,
did you, Vaughn?

49:46.945 --> 49:50.115
You human piece
of cow flop!

49:50.240 --> 49:54.953
You big steaming pile
of mastodon dung!

49:55.037 --> 49:58.165
Bring out
the pooper-scooper!

49:58.248 --> 50:00.876
You bush-league,
no-talent,

50:00.959 --> 50:03.504
flash-in-the-pan
choke artist!

50:03.629 --> 50:06.173
Huh?
Hey, where you going, Vaughn?

50:06.298 --> 50:08.258
Huh? You looking
for your Terminator?

50:08.383 --> 50:11.303
Yeah, you go back
in there, Vaughn.

50:14.973 --> 50:17.434
Hey, didn't I say
go to the bull pen?

50:17.518 --> 50:21.480
We're down by 10 runs.

50:21.605 --> 50:23.232
You can still
get some work in.

50:23.315 --> 50:25.526
I've had enough
of that maniac out there.

50:28.028 --> 50:28.946
Ow!

50:29.029 --> 50:29.947
Time!

50:30.030 --> 50:30.948
Ball hit him!

50:31.031 --> 50:32.199
First base!

50:34.493 --> 50:35.369
Hayes,

50:35.494 --> 50:36.954
go run for Rube.

50:37.079 --> 50:38.121
My leg's hurtin'.

50:38.205 --> 50:39.373
I'll run.

50:39.498 --> 50:42.960
Rube's hurting worse than you.
Now get in there.

50:43.043 --> 50:44.378
Gutless wonder
doesn't have to pitch.

50:44.461 --> 50:45.838
Why should I have to run?

50:45.921 --> 50:48.090
Who you calling a gutless wonder,
tin man?

50:48.173 --> 50:51.134
I got a genuine
leg injury here, pal.

50:51.218 --> 50:53.887
That limp's the best acting
you've done all year.

50:54.012 --> 50:56.390
At least I don't have
some cover girl

50:56.515 --> 50:58.141
dragging me around
by myjohnson.

51:05.357 --> 51:06.358
What are you guys doing?

51:06.441 --> 51:07.943
This isn't nice.

51:10.112 --> 51:11.321
Don't touch me. Don't-

51:13.198 --> 51:15.242
I'll show you a fight.
Come on!

51:15.367 --> 51:16.994
I'll take on
the whole team!

51:17.077 --> 51:18.829
You don't know
how to fight!

51:18.954 --> 51:20.164
You wusses!

51:20.289 --> 51:21.999
Wake up, Harry.

51:22.082 --> 51:23.208
Look.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.835
My God...

51:24.960 --> 51:26.420
Good news, fans.

51:26.545 --> 51:28.255
The Indians are showing
signs of life

51:28.380 --> 51:30.299
for the first time
in weeks.

51:30.382 --> 51:32.217
In fact,
they appear to be

51:32.342 --> 51:35.596
beating the crap
out of each other.

51:35.888 --> 51:37.556
It looks like
Willie Hayes

51:37.681 --> 51:39.349
is trying to hit
RickVaughn.

51:39.474 --> 51:42.311
And why not? Everybody else
in the league does.

51:42.394 --> 51:45.022
He swings and misses.

51:45.105 --> 51:48.358
It looks like Vaughn's
carrying his left a little low.

51:48.442 --> 51:51.528
This could hurt him
in the later rounds.

51:51.653 --> 51:53.030
So, what do we do?

51:53.113 --> 51:55.282
Toss 'em, I guess.

51:55.407 --> 51:57.284
The whole team?

51:57.409 --> 51:58.285
Yeah.

51:59.995 --> 52:02.039
Alright,
you're outta here!

52:02.122 --> 52:03.582
All of ya!

52:06.043 --> 52:07.211
Well, it's not broken,

52:07.336 --> 52:11.965
But you'll have to stay off it
for a couple days.

52:12.049 --> 52:13.967
Lucky son of a gun.

52:14.051 --> 52:15.511
At least you ain't
got to hang around

52:15.803 --> 52:17.513
to play the second game,
right?

52:22.059 --> 52:22.976
Hey, Willie.

52:24.478 --> 52:25.354
Willie!

52:27.773 --> 52:30.317
I can't believe
you said that.

52:30.400 --> 52:33.529
Shit!

52:33.821 --> 52:35.364
I talked
to a downtown boy

52:35.489 --> 52:37.241
in the bleachers
the other day.

52:38.305 --> 52:44.679
