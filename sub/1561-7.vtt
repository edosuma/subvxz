00:02.628 --> 00:04.221
(birds chirping)

00:17.726 --> 00:20.400
(rattling)

00:28.946 --> 00:31.199
(rattling)

00:37.913 --> 00:39.415
What you got there?

00:39.623 --> 00:41.091
Rattlesnakes.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.134
Careful... the venom hasn't
been milked from those yet.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.678
Just use
one of those copperheads

00:44.878 --> 00:46.130
from back there
for the sermon tonight.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.136
Daddy used the poisonous ones...

00:48.340 --> 00:49.762
and we're gonna honor his life

00:49.967 --> 00:51.890
by doing things
the way he did 'em.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.437
Want to die the way he did, too?

00:53.637 --> 00:55.935
It's about your sermon, Zach,

00:56.139 --> 00:57.937
your message.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.610
They don't know what kind
of snakes you're using up there.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.154
They don't care.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.822
Do you know how disappointed
Daddy would be

01:05.022 --> 01:08.493
if he knew how our numbers
had dwindled?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.662
These people need something
to believe in.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.864
ZACH: "But now that you have"

01:13.073 --> 01:15.792
“been set free from sin,

01:15.993 --> 01:19.122
and have become...“

01:19.329 --> 01:21.377
Uh, let's see.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.834
“...you've become

01:23.041 --> 01:25.339
slaves of God.“

01:25.544 --> 01:26.966
(coughs)

01:27.170 --> 01:28.592
ZACH: I'm sorry.

01:28.797 --> 01:32.893
My daddy... he...

01:33.093 --> 01:35.892
he had a way of bringing this
old book to life, didn't he?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.565
You know what he used to say
to me as a boy?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.814
“There is death

01:42.019 --> 01:43.521
in that box.“

01:43.729 --> 01:45.731
And today...

01:45.939 --> 01:47.566
I will not run from death,

01:47.774 --> 01:49.868
for God has anointed me

01:50.068 --> 01:53.447
to handle
these deadly creatures.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.157
(organ playing)

01:55.365 --> 01:57.242
ZACH: In... this...

01:57.451 --> 01:59.419
venomous serpent,

01:59.620 --> 02:02.794
I hold, glory to God,

02:02.998 --> 02:05.217
death in my hands!

02:05.417 --> 02:08.717
This serpent...

02:08.919 --> 02:10.045
it cannot conquer me.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.050
WOMAN: Sir.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.508
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.013
No way.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.060
And his plan is perfect.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.229
(snake hisses)

02:18.430 --> 02:19.647
(people gasping)

02:19.848 --> 02:22.692
(crying): Zach...
Oh, no, no, no.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.315
Are you all r...

02:24.519 --> 02:26.237
Somebody call for help!

02:28.482 --> 02:31.406
(distorted, echoing): Zach,
you stay with me, okay?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.157
Don't you...

02:33.362 --> 02:35.706
##

02:53.090 --> 02:55.468
(sobbing): Oh, God...

02:57.636 --> 02:58.808
(sharp inhale)

02:59.012 --> 03:02.186
(people gasping)

03:11.817 --> 03:14.070
(panting): I saw it.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.120
MAN: Praise the Lord.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.039
I saw it.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.787
Praise Jesus,

03:19.991 --> 03:21.459
I saw it!

03:21.660 --> 03:23.628
MAN: Let me feel the
spirit, preacher!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.582
(panting)

03:26.790 --> 03:28.838
Let me feel the spirit. Please.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.261
(panting)

03:33.046 --> 03:34.298
(gasping)

03:34.506 --> 03:35.758
(crutches clatter to floor)

03:35.966 --> 03:38.014
Oh, my leg! It's back!

03:38.218 --> 03:38.935
I'm healed!

03:39.136 --> 03:39.853
Praise the Lord!

03:40.053 --> 03:40.770
Praise the Lord!

03:40.971 --> 03:41.688
I'm healed!

03:41.888 --> 03:44.732
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

03:45.892 --> 03:47.360
(laughs): My leg!

04:07.581 --> 04:10.460
(woman speaks indistinctly)

04:12.627 --> 04:14.504
Getting there.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.307
Nice work.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.357
Thanks.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.612
(rattling)

04:34.816 --> 04:36.284
(screams)

04:38.028 --> 04:40.030
Are you all right?

04:40.238 --> 04:42.036
(Zed panting)

04:43.742 --> 04:44.743
Yes.

04:44.951 --> 04:45.793
Sorry.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.541
On that spirited note,

04:47.746 --> 04:50.465
everyone, um, take 15.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.502
(panting)

04:57.380 --> 04:59.849
Hope it wasn't me.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.222
Huh?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.645
No. No, um...

05:03.845 --> 05:05.438
you were fine.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.141
(laughs): You were
more than fine.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.898
15 minutes... that should be
time for a cup of coffee.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.444
I saw a machine downstairs.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.988
I'm Eddie.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.407
Um, Zed.

05:15.607 --> 05:18.360
I'm sorry, I-I... I have to go.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.162
Oh, okay. Um...
what about dinner?

05:21.363 --> 05:24.333
- You know what? I-I really, I-I don't...
- Eat?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.587
Uh...

05:35.293 --> 05:37.341
Giancarlo's.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.640
Thursday, 7:00 p.m.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.932
Okay.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.429
(laughs)

05:44.094 --> 05:46.643
ZED: John,
I just had this insane vision.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.064
- Oh, how are you, John?
- I didn't have to touch anything

05:48.265 --> 05:49.187
Well, actually, I have a little bit of a bad neck.
- to have the vision.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.187
And I swore it was real.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.234
You know, I slept a bit
awkward last night...

05:51.434 --> 05:52.902
I mean, I saw these snakes
crawling up my leg,

05:53.103 --> 05:54.525
and one of those snakes
actually went up and bit my leg.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.821
What, you said snakes?

05:56.022 --> 05:57.615
Yeah.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.818
Our training is expanding
your psychic awareness.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.152
You see there?

06:02.404 --> 06:03.496
What, Kentucky?

06:03.697 --> 06:04.949
Middle of bugger all.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.284
Seems a preacher was bit

06:07.492 --> 06:09.415
by a poisonous snake,
which explains your vision.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.587
He came back to life,
started performing miracles,

06:11.788 --> 06:13.711
and now...

06:13.915 --> 06:15.212
He's a bloody star.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.762
This is from
a conspiracy Web site.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.589
Nabbed this bad boy

06:20.797 --> 06:22.174
off the Grim Reaper himself.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.100
It says that he regrew
a man's leg.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.598
(laughs): Yeah, I saw lots

06:25.802 --> 06:26.598
of these cons growing up.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.645
Oh, yeah, and, uh,

06:27.846 --> 06:28.938
where was that exactly?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.231
Uh-uh.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.524
Hmm.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.774
Well, I must have protection.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.230
Of various kinds.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.112
We're gonna go visit
a preacher in a church?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.695
Yeah. That's a good point.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.202
So, Chas is off duty.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.158
He's making good
with his daughter.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.164
Guess what that means.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.120
You're driving.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.797
Grab my coat, will you?

06:53.997 --> 06:57.797
ZACH:
In my name shall they cast out.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.550
They shall...

07:00.754 --> 07:02.552
lay hands on the sick,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.724
and they shall...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.927
Excuse me, luv.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.721
Many of you have traveled

07:09.930 --> 07:12.934
a great distance
to be here this...

07:13.141 --> 07:14.984
beautiful Sunday morning

07:15.185 --> 07:16.653
the Lord has gifted us!

07:16.853 --> 07:18.651
We done with
the boring part yet?

07:18.855 --> 07:20.357
ZACH: And I know...

07:20.565 --> 07:23.489
this is the part
y'all been waiting for.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.694
(shouting)

07:24.903 --> 07:28.123
Your faith has been rewarded.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.042
God has come to grace us,

07:31.242 --> 07:33.870
and today
you shall witness his power.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.332
And let me tell you,

07:36.539 --> 07:37.461
it is great!

07:37.666 --> 07:39.259
Can you feel it?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.211
(shouting, whooping)

07:41.419 --> 07:43.968
MAN:
I can feel the power of God!

07:48.760 --> 07:50.933
I invite you to be healed.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.065
(gasps)

07:54.265 --> 07:56.063
(crying): I can s-see.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.985
(people shouting)

07:58.186 --> 07:59.483
This is just ridiculous.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.190
You brought me here for this?

08:01.398 --> 08:02.900
You brought me here...
Your vision,

08:03.108 --> 08:04.610
if I recall correctly.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.162
They're all so hungry
for something to believe in.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.739
He's just preying on them.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.200
Yeah, well,
suckers make easy prey.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.625
They're not suckers.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.373
They're just not jaded like you.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.625
They're still searching
for the magic in their lives.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.878
Didn't take you
for a religious one.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.925
I don't know what I am...

08:21.126 --> 08:24.881
but I like to believe there's
a... guiding hand in it all.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.261
Guiding... judging...

08:27.465 --> 08:28.933
Damning.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.886
He's a jack-of-all-trades,
really.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.721
I mean, I'm not critiquing
or anything,

08:32.929 --> 08:35.398
but I'm pretty sure
he's not very keen on me.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.101
(crowd chattering, whooping)

08:38.308 --> 08:40.437
In his name...

08:40.645 --> 08:42.773
I heal you.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.111
(crowd cheering, shouting)

08:49.487 --> 08:51.865
Still think we came
to the wrong place?

08:53.241 --> 08:56.085
(chanting in foreign language)

08:56.286 --> 08:58.334
(crowd chattering, whooping)

08:58.538 --> 09:00.961
(continues chanting
in foreign language)

09:02.751 --> 09:04.970
That's Enochian.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.468
Thelanguage
of the bloody angels.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.842
Angels... they really exist?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.473
Unfortunately, yes.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.475
I don't speak their lingo,

09:14.679 --> 09:15.931
but I recognize the sound.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.436
Have you met one?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.063
Let's just table
the angel talk, luv.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.941
It's the preacher
we need to focus on here.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.900
Nobody wields that kind
of power without consequences.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.407
MAN: I got to tell you, Doc, it
happened right before my eyes.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.407
(chuckles)

09:30.570 --> 09:31.947
Remarkable.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.046
It's getting kind
of hot in here.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.089
Yeah, we're almost done, Nate.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.671
Briarwood Med sent me your,
uh, scans from two years ago.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.345
Uh, they'd rushed you into their
ER as a result of, what was it?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.013
A trucking accident.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.306
Trucking accident.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.305
Your leg was crushed,
nerves severed.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.011
And then look at today's scans.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.972
The bone has regenerated, the
skin, the tissue, everything.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.727
If I hadn't seen
all your other scans,

09:58.932 --> 10:00.650
I'd swear you were
a different man.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.272
All right.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.656
All right, and just look
into my left ear.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.449
Now, open your eyes for me.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.539
Nate.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.051
(screaming)

10:32.215 --> 10:34.809
(snarls)

10:54.195 --> 10:55.117
Here.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.666
“Commerce at God's door.“

10:58.867 --> 11:00.494
Makes me feel all bright and

11:00.660 --> 11:01.707
shiny.

11:01.911 --> 11:02.958
Oh, ljust love your accent.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.289
You're not from around here.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.249
Sharp tack, you are, luv.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.710
Liverpool, England.
But, uh, I'm well traveled.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.044
Yeah, we drove in from, uh,

11:10.253 --> 11:12.176
Tennessee about
a week and a half ago.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.464
Uh, Preacher Zachary, he cleared

11:13.673 --> 11:14.765
Nancy's chronic arthritis

11:14.966 --> 11:16.013
with just a touch.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.469
Pain-free.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.145
Are you going
down to the river tomorrow?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.722
There's a group baptism.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.274
Well, I tell you what,
I fancy a dip right now.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.150
What's your name, darling?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.652
Zed.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.029
Give me your hands.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.245
You have doubt.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.948
Inside.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.908
I have a good reason to doubt.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.210
But you want to believe.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.291
I can see that.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.350
May God bless your soul.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.816
Oh, no, I've, uh...

12:13.024 --> 12:14.776
Got a bit of a cold, actually.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.156
Wouldn't want to make you sick.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.240
But thanks, anyway.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.245
What can I do for you?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.666
Just a quick question.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.916
Where did you learn
the Enochian you spoke?

12:26.120 --> 12:27.497
Pardon me?

12:27.705 --> 12:28.877
Enochian.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.924
It's the language of the angels.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.346
You spoke it
in your sermon this morning.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.675
Who are we to question the gifts
we receive from the Lord?

12:38.883 --> 12:41.432
God bless your soul.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.390
(snarls)

12:54.524 --> 12:55.901
(siren chirps)

13:18.756 --> 13:21.930
(indistinct radio transmission)

13:22.135 --> 13:24.308
(grunts)

13:24.512 --> 13:25.934
Aah!

13:26.139 --> 13:27.140
(screams)

13:28.725 --> 13:30.398
(scream fades)

13:34.230 --> 13:37.029
(growls)

13:37.233 --> 13:39.406
I could feel him, John.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.112
He was so close to death.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.244
I felt what he felt
in that moment.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.995
An angel. So you said.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.872
Thanks, mate.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.704
Just about the only thing around
here that isn't deep fried.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.166
So you get any other sense of
Zachary the Great and Powerful?

13:53.374 --> 13:55.172
Well, he has good intentions

13:55.376 --> 13:57.424
and he's unquestioning
in his faith.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.756
Bit boring, but okay.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.013
Let's say he's not the dark
part of this equation.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.311
Unless he's being manipulated.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.139
Blind faith can be
a dangerous thing.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.567
(soft chuckle)
Spoken from experience?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.239
Maybe what the preacher's
doing is legitimate.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.032
From what I read,
Briarwood went through

14:18.232 --> 14:19.654
a pretty rough drought
this past year.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.076
Everyone's trying
to make ends meet.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.745
Maybe these people get
to have their miracles.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.697
Well, miracles are
ours to make, luv.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.955
And your visions are connected
to the scry map, remember?

14:28.159 --> 14:30.457
Scry map bad.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.959
But his heart is
in the right place.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.292
Well, I can't speak to that,

14:35.500 --> 14:38.128
but I can speak to his magic.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.589
It's much too powerful.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.971
All this healing energy... it
has to come from somewhere.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.928
If history's any
indication, then

14:47.136 --> 14:50.106
it'll be taking its toll
on the land already.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.354
On the land?

14:52.558 --> 14:55.027
Follow me.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.023
I thought I smelled something.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.285
(sighs) Pobrecitos.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.162
What's happening in the church

15:08.366 --> 15:10.209
is a front for something dark,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.128
something poisonous.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.625
And we need to find out

15:13.830 --> 15:15.628
what before that poison spreads.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.925
Manny.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.172
Manny.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.222
Who's Manny?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.675
He's an angel.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.600
So you do know one.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.178
Can I meet him?

15:28.386 --> 15:30.730
No, no, you wipe that look
of wonder off your face.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.729
This one isn't as awe-inspiring
as the title suggests.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.810
Are you kidding me?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.736
With all the darkness
and all the scary stuff

15:37.937 --> 15:39.234
in the world
of John Constantine,

15:39.439 --> 15:40.941
finally there's something light?

15:41.149 --> 15:43.572
Manny!

15:43.776 --> 15:46.950
Maybe if you asked nicer.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.907
(short laugh)

15:49.115 --> 15:52.119
(people clamoring)

16:03.713 --> 16:06.307
(coughs)

16:06.507 --> 16:09.306
Do you see all those people
out there?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.308
We're gonna need
to build a bigger church.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.265
Yeah, it's amazing.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.444
I hear there's one family come
all the way from Poughkeepsie.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.772
You... You think maybe we
ought to slow down a little?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.403
Just try to...

16:23.608 --> 16:25.610
figure out exactly what
we got on our hands?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.741
It's not our place
to question the gift.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.164
Where's my pen?
I got a sermon to write.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.082
It's just... We don't know
where it comes from.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.409
Sarah,

16:33.618 --> 16:35.666
I almost died.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
But I didn't.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.707
God wants this.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.637
And he's using me to do it.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.339
Or maybe it's Daddy
shining down on us from heaven.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.300
Whatever the case,
our path is clear.

16:52.929 --> 16:56.183
(quiet, rattling cough)

16:56.390 --> 16:59.439
All right, you wanker.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.648
You won't come the easy way...

17:05.358 --> 17:08.328
I am bringing out the big guns.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.826
You're going to lure
an angel with drugs?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.748
It's dried myrtle, luv.

17:19.829 --> 17:23.003
By the divine power
that holds the balance,

17:23.209 --> 17:25.211
bring forth your servant

17:25.419 --> 17:27.171
of ministering.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.303
By your wisdom and your justice,

17:29.507 --> 17:31.885
your will be done.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.187
Please.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.941
That was a nice touch.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.859
Won't make the slightest bit
of difference, luv.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.240
On the contrary,
the girl's right...

17:46.440 --> 17:49.034
Courtesy counts.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.869
What, you want to hear me beg,
is that it?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.575
Reminds me of an ex-girlfriend

17:55.783 --> 17:56.705
of mine.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.876
I do have other mortals
to watch over,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.249
John.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.584
I don't want you to watch,

18:00.788 --> 18:02.335
I want you to listen.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.134
There's a preacher in town...

18:05.334 --> 18:07.962
He's using
some pretty powerful magic.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.171
So I can see.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.381
He's speaking

18:10.590 --> 18:12.638
in Enochian tongues.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.141
I need to know what he's saying.

18:16.345 --> 18:20.020
It would only make sense
if you stand facing the sun.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.646
(laughs)

18:21.851 --> 18:24.400
You just... love a good riddle,

18:24.604 --> 18:25.821
don't you?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.274
Look, I'm a foot
past the line, John.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.654
You know I cannot

18:29.859 --> 18:32.157
sway the outcome of events.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.079
All right.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.408
While I face the sun.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.833
Then what?

18:38.034 --> 18:39.957
What good is it really gonna...
Oh.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.584
Bollocks.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.710
Not much of a guardian

18:43.914 --> 18:45.962
angel if he's not here
when you want him, huh?

18:46.125 --> 18:49.254
No, he got his point across.
Come here. Do me a favor, luv.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.214
Hum that tune you heard today.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.389
The Enochian.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.842
What for?

18:54.050 --> 18:57.224
Just... humor me.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.518
(hums)

19:09.273 --> 19:11.150
(humming)

19:17.782 --> 19:19.659
(same melody echoes in distance)

19:21.494 --> 19:23.041
Do you hear that?

19:23.245 --> 19:25.088
Yeah.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.335
Echolocation.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.841
(melody continues)

19:35.049 --> 19:35.845
It's getting louder.

19:36.050 --> 19:36.892
(mutters)

19:39.929 --> 19:41.397
There.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
Careful, careful.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.122
A y, Dios mio.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.674
It looks abandoned.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.627
We should be safe here for now.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.554
Over there.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.090
Here, take her.

20:16.298 --> 20:16.924
Yeah, yeah.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.309
Here you are, luv.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.913
She's an actual angel.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.370
Is this the one you know?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.330
No, this one's a lot prettier.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.040
I'm Imogen.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.670
What happened to you, luv?

20:50.875 --> 20:53.253
I was taking a dying mortal
to heaven.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.259
I don't know how, but...

20:55.463 --> 20:58.057
he pulled a feather
from my wing.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.680
He was revived.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.808
I fell to Earth.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.356
That must be what I saw in my
vision when I touched Zachary.

21:05.556 --> 21:06.648
Uh-huh.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.066
It's the only way an angel
can enter our plane

21:08.267 --> 21:11.646
in physical form:
damage to the wings.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.481
One feather.

21:13.689 --> 21:17.364
Piss-poor design, if you ask me.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.787
That's what Zachary has.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.614
An angel's feather.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.451
Piqued your interest
now, have we?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.459
Who are you talking to?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.499
The ugly one.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.173
ZED (laughing): Where is he?

21:37.004 --> 21:38.096
Are you okay?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.720
I don't know.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.347
Everything hurts.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.848
You could've helped me
find her faster,

21:44.053 --> 21:44.804
you know.

21:45.012 --> 21:45.763
Is he over here?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.019
I didn't know she fell, John.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.646
Angels are compartmentalized.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.603
All part of the plan to
prevent our interference,

21:52.812 --> 21:54.780
Keep humanity's free will
intact.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.947
A little to your right, luv.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.243
Are riddles and...

21:59.443 --> 22:02.413
minimally helpful guidance
also part of the plan?

22:02.613 --> 22:05.162
A mortal has never been able

22:05.366 --> 22:07.243
to remove an
angel's feather before.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.250
Imogen doesn't belong
here. She won't last.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.877
Ask him if an angel can die.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.710
Yes.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.137
The soul is extinguished.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.183
We simply cease to exist.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.894
We need to get
that feather back.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.062
What is this?

22:34.270 --> 22:35.487
Protection spell.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.316
Once I'm done, evil will not
be able to cross the line

22:38.524 --> 22:40.117
created by the flowing water.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.990
Should keep Imogen safe
while we get the feather back

22:42.194 --> 22:43.161
from Zachary.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.739
I should stay.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.415
She's gonna be alone.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.912
CONSTANTINE:
She's not alone, luv.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.290
Manny.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.711
How come I can't see him?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.459
He's in spirit form.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.417
He reveals himself to me,
principally to annoy me,

22:56.625 --> 22:57.842
I'm convinced.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.421
But Imogen fell to Earth.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.850
She entered the mortal plane,
so she's corporeal.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.802
That's why we can both see her.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.763
You're gobsmacked, aren't you?

23:09.930 --> 23:13.104
I just...

23:13.309 --> 23:15.778
I believed everything
I was told as a girl.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.106
The older I got...

23:18.314 --> 23:20.157
the more lies I uncovered.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.075
But angels here? I mean...

23:22.276 --> 23:24.574
I have so many questions
I want to ask them.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.829
Good luck with that, luv.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.828
They're real cagey types.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.875
What do you need them
to tell you?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.703
Where my powers come from,
for starters.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.791
I mean, do they come from God
or somewhere else?

23:35.998 --> 23:37.625
Doesn't matter
where they came from.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.211
What matters
is what you do with them

23:40.419 --> 23:42.387
and what it costs you.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.057
You act like religion
is for suckers,

23:45.257 --> 23:47.055
but there it is.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.681
Evidence.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.263
How can you still be so cynical?

23:50.471 --> 23:52.690
Oh, wouldn't it be lovely
if I wasn't?

23:52.890 --> 23:54.892
Could've been a better man
if I hadn't seen it all.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.977
Yes, angels exist.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.563
Sound the bloody trumpets.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.240
As for religion,
yeah, all right,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.238
be nice to your neighbor
and all that, but...

24:03.442 --> 24:05.945
the world isn't all puppy dogs
and rainbows.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.372
Can't just pray evil away.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.870
Still have to fight, hard,

24:11.075 --> 24:11.917
on our own.

24:12.117 --> 24:12.959
(water running)

24:13.118 --> 24:14.745
Akasha, mi geill

24:14.954 --> 24:15.750
mo prana ri sibh.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.003
(speaking Sanskrit)

24:24.672 --> 24:26.549
(indistinct radio transmission)

24:33.931 --> 24:36.104
Says he's looking
for Nate Byars.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.437
Nate Byars? What for?

24:39.645 --> 24:41.113
He's a murder suspect.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.986
Says he killed a police officer.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.775
And a doctor
just outside of town.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.782
Nate would never hurt anyone.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.785
That officer must be mistaken.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.536
Nate was the first person
you healed.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.957
It's dangerous to go playing

24:53.158 --> 24:54.535
with things
you don't understand.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.292
We're not meant
to understand God's plan.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.543
We're meant to execute it.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.839
Do you realize

25:00.040 --> 25:02.338
how foolish it is to think
God gave you this power?

25:02.543 --> 25:04.591
This is about your glory,
not God's.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.844
(coughing)

25:08.048 --> 25:09.265
You're sick.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.015
Why didn't you ask me
to heal you?

25:12.219 --> 25:12.936
Don't.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.019
You don't trust me.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.648
(sighs) You've been different.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.651
(sighs) Your head's not quiet.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.323
Started even

25:24.523 --> 25:26.070
before you got the power.

25:26.275 --> 25:29.745
I never paid no mind to it.
Now I can't ignore it.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.824
I just felt Daddy's death
more deeply than you did.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.831
No. No, before Daddy died.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.130
There's something you're not
telling me. This power,

25:39.329 --> 25:41.331
whatever you do with it,

25:41.540 --> 25:44.168
it won't lighten that burden,
whatever it may be.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.969
I need you to leave.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.844
And don't bother coming
back to the church.

25:49.048 --> 25:52.268
I can't have a nonbeliever
tainting my flock.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.196
I need to get this guy alone.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.406
Have a private chat
with him at his house.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.491
I'll come with you.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.575
It's better if you stay here.

26:16.784 --> 26:20.334
Things could get unpleasant.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.253
Former Girl Scout, are we?

26:23.457 --> 26:24.583
Not exactly.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.964
You know, one of these days

26:26.168 --> 26:28.842
you're gonna have to let me be
the mysterious one of the duo.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.343
One of these days.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.015
Remember,

26:32.216 --> 26:33.763
we have to save Zachary
from himself.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.061
It's not his fault.
He thinks he's doing good.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.229
Well, then I'll have to impress
upon him his moral duty,

26:38.430 --> 26:41.855
won't I?
Physically, if necessary.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.980
(thunder cracks)

26:48.107 --> 26:50.656
(knocking)

26:55.739 --> 26:58.583
I remember you.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.377
You feeling all better

27:00.577 --> 27:01.874
from your cold?

27:02.079 --> 27:03.422
Much. Ta.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.672
You'll have to wait until
morning and wait in line again.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.924
God doesn't play favorites.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.927
I know about the angel feather.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.817
Whatever your intentions,

27:24.017 --> 27:26.145
you're doing more harm
than good.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.229
And you are...?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.814
A concerned citizen.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.945
You have something
that doesn't belong to you,

27:31.150 --> 27:32.777
and if you continue to use it,

27:32.985 --> 27:34.783
there will be a cost,

27:34.987 --> 27:37.365
not least of which
will be a dead angel.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.497
People just love telling me
what to do.

27:40.701 --> 27:41.247
I'm sure.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.043
How do I know

27:42.244 --> 27:43.962
that you'll return the feather

27:44.163 --> 27:46.131
to this... angel you're
talking about instead

27:46.331 --> 27:47.503
of taking the power
for yourself?

27:47.708 --> 27:49.005
That's a good point.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.170
Sorry in advance.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.509
No!

27:53.714 --> 27:55.216
(panting)

27:56.967 --> 27:59.811
That was the feather, not me.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.765
But it confirms one
thing that I felt...

28:02.973 --> 28:05.977
You are the only evil here.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.734
Leave.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.315
And don't come back.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.283
(crickets chirping)

28:20.490 --> 28:22.913
(brush crunching)

28:29.291 --> 28:30.838
(screams)

28:31.043 --> 28:32.966
(gasping)

28:37.966 --> 28:41.766
(grunting)

28:52.564 --> 28:54.282
(Nate growling)

28:57.152 --> 29:00.326
(grunting)

29:05.285 --> 29:07.504
You okay? Yeah.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.471
CONSTANTINE: I call them ghouls.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.799
They're formed
by magic gone wrong.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.225
I recognized the one
that attacked Zed

29:20.425 --> 29:23.019
from an article online.
The preacher, he healed his leg.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.392
Mortals aren't meant to wield

29:24.596 --> 29:25.722
the power of angels.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.808
Nate was the first one healed.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.859
More will turn, just like him.

29:30.060 --> 29:30.902
So why did he come after me?

29:31.103 --> 29:31.945
I don't think

29:32.145 --> 29:33.362
he was trying to kill you, luv.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.780
It looked to me that he was...

29:34.982 --> 29:36.859
searching for something.

29:37.067 --> 29:38.614
When you touched Zachary,
you had a vision,

29:38.819 --> 29:41.493
which means you took on
some of his energy.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.825
Maybe he wanted Zachary
to heal him again.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.285
We need to get the feather back
to you.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.870
With the magic in
its rightful place,

29:48.078 --> 29:50.126
It should stop the
rest from turning.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.547
You need to work fast.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.795
She's getting weaker
by the minute.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.468
Yeah, the trouble is,

29:54.668 --> 29:57.592
Preacher Zachary has
the feather's power on his side.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.797
(cheering, rhythmic clapping)

29:59.006 --> 30:00.007
He was our friend,

30:00.215 --> 30:01.432
(snakes hissing, rattling)

30:01.633 --> 30:02.885
our neighbor,

30:03.093 --> 30:04.891
our brother.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.518
But inside Nate Byars

30:07.723 --> 30:11.023
a darkness lay in wait.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.274
I offer my healing hand

30:13.478 --> 30:15.651
to those pure of heart.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.028
So we,

30:17.232 --> 30:19.985
powerful, may unite

30:20.152 --> 30:22.826
against the dark.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.874
ZED: Preacher, I
made a huge mistake.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.667
I trusted the wrong man.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.916
See, uh, my friend John,

30:30.120 --> 30:31.838
he doesn't care about me

30:32.039 --> 30:34.007
or anything
that's happening here.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.801
I don't even know why he came.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.221
And you don't want to know.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.844
He had a dark purpose.

30:42.049 --> 30:45.474
You were right about me.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.146
I want to believe.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.644
Recognizing the path you're on

30:49.848 --> 30:51.942
is the first step
in changing direction.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.736
I wish I could start all over.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.564
If your heart is true,

30:57.773 --> 31:01.903
it's never too late
to surrender your will to God.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.872
What do you know about baptism?

31:11.745 --> 31:13.088
Hallelujah!

31:13.288 --> 31:14.790
CROWD: Hallelujah!

31:14.998 --> 31:16.875
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

31:17.084 --> 31:18.836
Amen!

31:28.011 --> 31:31.265
You ready to leave
your old life behind you?

31:31.473 --> 31:32.816
Iam.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.485
I baptize you now

31:35.685 --> 31:38.564
in front of these witnesses.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.898
In the name of the Father

31:40.107 --> 31:42.701
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.156
And everybody said amen!

31:47.364 --> 31:48.206
Amen!

31:50.575 --> 31:52.669
Why?

31:52.869 --> 31:54.416
Why would you...?

31:54.621 --> 31:56.874
I had to. Get off! Get off!

31:58.375 --> 31:59.592
MAN: Nancy,

31:59.793 --> 32:01.636
what's wrong? (grunts)

32:01.837 --> 32:03.635
(growling)

32:03.839 --> 32:05.512
(grunting)

32:07.217 --> 32:08.685
Everybody run!

32:08.885 --> 32:09.932
(screaming)

32:10.137 --> 32:12.640
(growling)

32:19.563 --> 32:20.280
Look what you've done!

32:20.480 --> 32:21.151
This is what we were trying
to avoid!

32:21.356 --> 32:21.948
Run to the church!

32:22.149 --> 32:22.775
ZED: Come on!

32:22.983 --> 32:24.735
Come on! Let's go!

32:24.943 --> 32:27.617
(grunting)

32:31.658 --> 32:33.080
Go! Go!

32:33.285 --> 32:35.379
(groans) Get in there!

32:43.170 --> 32:45.423
(both grunting)

32:45.630 --> 32:46.927
(grunting)

32:47.132 --> 32:48.759
(grunts)
They're after the feather.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.184
Zed, you have
to get it to Imogen.

32:50.385 --> 32:50.886
Go out the back.

32:51.094 --> 32:51.595
What about you?

32:51.803 --> 32:52.929
We can hold it here. Go!

32:53.138 --> 32:54.310
(banging on door)

32:54.514 --> 32:56.892
(Constantine pants loudly,
rattling at door)

33:00.103 --> 33:02.276
It hurts so much.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.280
(sighs)

33:05.484 --> 33:08.533
John is your best chance
at getting that feather back.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.453
What...?

33:19.539 --> 33:21.086
What's it like?

33:23.210 --> 33:24.553
Pain.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.097
It comes in waves.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.763
You feel helpless.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.140
You can't fight it.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.474
It becomes about making
it to the other side,

33:36.681 --> 33:40.060
shrinking your world down
to one fine point.

33:40.268 --> 33:44.489
When that wave melts away,
you feel relief.

33:44.689 --> 33:48.910
Just for a moment,

33:49.110 --> 33:51.283
till it comes back
to remind you.

33:51.488 --> 33:55.038
So you feel pain now, but...

33:55.242 --> 33:57.461
what was it like

33:57.661 --> 34:01.382
the first moment
the sun hit your skin?

34:02.666 --> 34:04.964
How good was that?

34:09.130 --> 34:11.098
(Constantine grunts,
loud growling outside)

34:11.299 --> 34:12.551
Getting a little bit knackered
here, mate.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.431
I could really use your help
about now, yeah?

34:14.636 --> 34:15.888
I brought this on myself.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.848
Look, you got
a little bit of power,

34:18.056 --> 34:20.559
and you got off your trolley,
yeah? It happens.

34:20.766 --> 34:22.110
All we need to do is keep them

34:22.310 --> 34:24.187
at bay until Zed makes it
to the angel,

34:24.396 --> 34:26.114
so just do us a bloody favor.

34:26.313 --> 34:29.067
Pull your head out of your ass
and give us a hand, yeah?

34:29.275 --> 34:30.493
(growling outside)

34:30.694 --> 34:32.822
This was never a gift from God.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.371
I never deserved it.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.824
I've sinned,

34:36.032 --> 34:37.659
and this here's my punishment.

34:37.867 --> 34:38.538
(loud growling)

34:38.743 --> 34:39.460
That angel gets
her feather back,

34:39.661 --> 34:41.504
and these bastards revert back
to their mortal form.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.754
It should be... any minute now!

34:44.958 --> 34:47.130
I had too many that night.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.587
(loud growling)

34:48.753 --> 34:51.677
It was a deer, I told myself.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.679
I never went back to check.

34:53.882 --> 34:56.011
I just left the mess behind.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.266
What are you saying?

34:57.470 --> 34:59.973
I know it wasn't a deer!

35:00.181 --> 35:01.057
(growling continues)

35:01.266 --> 35:02.188
You killed a man.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.486
I never told no one.

35:04.686 --> 35:05.983
Didn't want my daddy

35:06.187 --> 35:08.064
looking at me
the way he always did.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.901
You had a mortal sin on
your soul when you nearly died,

35:11.109 --> 35:13.578
which means you weren't
on your way to heaven

35:13.778 --> 35:15.780
when you saw the angel.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.912
You were on your way to hell.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.618
(sighs)

35:19.826 --> 35:21.578
They're taking too long.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.834
Will John come through?

35:24.039 --> 35:26.258
If it serves him.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.803
Self-interest is natural
for them.

35:30.003 --> 35:32.426
You noticed, too?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.555
Right, they have no idea
the gift they were given

35:35.759 --> 35:38.558
when they got this world.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.184
We would have done better.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.935
Do you believe that?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.562
Of course.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.189
It's why we were put here.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.942
He gave them free will
to stand on their own,

35:48.146 --> 35:50.820
but all they do is fall

35:51.024 --> 35:52.867
over and over...

35:53.068 --> 35:55.036
And over and

35:55.236 --> 35:58.661
over and over.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.793
We're nothing but crutches
for his flawed creation.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.997
We shouldn't be
talking like this.

36:05.205 --> 36:06.832
Why not?

36:07.040 --> 36:08.417
I want this world back, Manny.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.506
Just for ourselves.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.097
(pantmg): I got it!

36:16.675 --> 36:18.518
You really think
I was headed to hell?

36:18.718 --> 36:21.267
Zed... we can't let her
give that feather to Imogen.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.848
We have to stop her.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.979
(growling)

36:28.186 --> 36:29.859
(Constantine grunting,
growling outside)

36:30.063 --> 36:32.657
Let's go.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.700
I deserve it!

36:34.901 --> 36:36.619
(Constantine panting,
others growling)

36:36.820 --> 36:39.539
(grunting)

36:47.872 --> 36:51.092
(groaning)

36:51.292 --> 36:52.134
(growling)

37:05.223 --> 37:07.021
This is not good.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.736
It worked.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.492
Beautifully.

37:28.288 --> 37:29.881
You're fallen.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.887
I have to admit,
I thought a ghoul

37:40.091 --> 37:42.514
would deliver me the feather,
but thank you, Zed.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.199
(grunts)

37:56.399 --> 37:57.776
Looks like my protection spell

37:57.984 --> 37:59.907
to keep evil out
is keeping evil in.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.657
A fallen angel finds
a desperate bloke,

38:03.865 --> 38:05.833
intercepts him at
the gates of hell

38:06.034 --> 38:07.456
and makes him think
it's the gates of heaven.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.130
Zachary didn't take
your feather.

38:11.331 --> 38:14.084
You put it in his hand so you
could break through to Earth.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.670
The ghouls were after the
feather to bring it back to you?

38:16.878 --> 38:18.346
You make it sound so easy.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.719
I faked the heavenly angel part.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.222
Pain... that was real.

38:23.426 --> 38:24.643
Hell must have
prepared you well.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.096
I'll never go back there.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.396
(Zed gasps loudly)

38:27.597 --> 38:28.723
Lift the spell,
or I will kill her.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.024
I deserve to be out there.

38:30.225 --> 38:33.274
I served loyally for lifetimes.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.775
(guttural gasping)

38:34.979 --> 38:36.276
Then I was cast out of heaven
for one indiscretion.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.324
What did you do?

38:38.525 --> 38:40.823
I killed a mortal.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.028
I wanted to see

38:42.237 --> 38:43.739
how easy it would be.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.199
(Zed gasps)

38:45.406 --> 38:46.999
You're the only one
who can stop this.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.167
You know I can't.

38:48.368 --> 38:49.585
You mean you won't.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.630
Help her!

38:52.831 --> 38:56.051
You're either in this bloody
fight with me, or you're not.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.719
Come on.

38:59.587 --> 39:00.634
You know the rules!

39:00.839 --> 39:02.091
Manny!

39:02.298 --> 39:04.016
(gasps)

39:04.217 --> 39:05.343
Guess you're on your own.

39:05.552 --> 39:08.055
Your angel did what
they always do...

39:08.263 --> 39:09.105
Nothing!

39:09.305 --> 39:11.683
Like hell.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.393
(grunting)

39:13.601 --> 39:14.944
(groaning)

39:15.144 --> 39:16.191
(gasps)

39:31.786 --> 39:33.379
ZED: John?

39:33.580 --> 39:35.548
What is this?

39:35.707 --> 39:37.254
No.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.131
You don't want to hold
that for too long, luv.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.587
That's concentrated evil.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.768
I know I've disappointed
more than a few of you.

39:46.968 --> 39:50.518
Got amends to make.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.446
I've, uh, felt the light
of an angel

39:57.645 --> 40:00.068
and the hand of the devil.

40:00.273 --> 40:04.198
Though those are forces
much greater than we are,

40:04.402 --> 40:06.200
the only thing

40:06.404 --> 40:11.376
more powerful is our ability
to choose.

40:11.576 --> 40:16.332
If you'll open your
hymnals to page 64,

40:16.539 --> 40:19.543
"All Glory Be Thine."

40:19.751 --> 40:21.753
MANNY: The preacher's
back in his church,

40:21.961 --> 40:24.635
still fighting desperately
to make amends for his sin,

40:24.839 --> 40:26.432
for the mistake that haunts him,

40:26.633 --> 40:28.806
Hoping it's not too late
to change his fate.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.227
Do you really think

40:30.428 --> 40:33.181
the preacher and I have anything
in common?

40:33.389 --> 40:36.017
You should know by now
I don't have all the answers.

40:36.225 --> 40:39.229
She fooled us all, mate.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.485
And that's not something
I admit to lightly.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.908
There's just

40:44.108 --> 40:47.578
one thing I can't wrap my head
around, though, and that's...

40:47.779 --> 40:50.658
how the bloody hell
she managed to break through.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.288
The barrier between hell and
Earth is getting thinner, John.

40:53.493 --> 40:57.794
Thinner than it's ever been.

40:57.997 --> 41:01.046
Consequence
of the rising darkness?

41:07.840 --> 41:10.093
But you saved the clay.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.599
That's the kind of faith
I can get behind.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.977
I will face consequences
for my actions.

41:15.181 --> 41:16.433
But what Imogen did...

41:16.641 --> 41:18.518
Shouldn't have been possible.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.399
Seems anything that has the will

41:20.603 --> 41:22.321
to leave hell will find a way.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.285
But when they do,

41:27.485 --> 41:29.704
we'll be waiting for them.

41:32.365 --> 41:35.710
(phone ringing)

41:41.290 --> 41:43.463
Hello.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.716
EDDIE: Don't tell me there's
another Giancarlo's in town.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.172
(laughs airily)

41:47.380 --> 41:48.848
Eddie.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.300
(sighs)

41:50.508 --> 41:52.351
I completely forgot.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.228
Oh, I-l can wait if you want.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.272
I'm so sorry.

41:56.472 --> 42:00.318
I just don't know
if I'll be any good tonight.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.065
Can we do this some other time?

42:02.270 --> 42:03.943
Yeah, of course.

42:04.147 --> 42:07.697
Thank you. Um, I'm sorry
you came all that way.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.744
It's no problem at all.
Take the time you need.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.322
Thanks.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.827
Bye.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.587
She's not coming.

42:19.787 --> 42:23.917
- Not tonight.
- Soon, then.
