WEBVTT

00:02.741 --> 00:04.526
Who's King?

00:04.569 --> 00:05.788
DEEKS:
He's the reason Sam created
his whole "Switch" alias.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.703
This a joke, bro

00:09.096 --> 00:11.359
'Cause LAPD has
no idea who he is.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.013
I'm King.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.015
And you're gonna help me
become a queen.

00:15.058 --> 00:17.104
I'm the L.A. district attorney,
you can't arrest me.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.802
I have King,
that's all I need.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.023
Just stay in the car.
Don't get out of the car.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.720
Don't do it!

00:24.763 --> 00:26.026
Switch.

00:26.069 --> 00:29.116
Stay with me.
King, stay with me.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.493
Get inside.

01:02.758 --> 01:05.021
We have no money.You think I'm stupid?

01:06.762 --> 01:07.937
What's up?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.808
He's alone.Where are the key codes?

01:09.852 --> 01:10.896
I don't know what you're...

01:10.940 --> 01:13.160
Where are the key codes?!

01:13.203 --> 01:14.987
:
Wait! Wait! Okay.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.685
Th-this way.
Move!

01:16.728 --> 01:18.295
Move! Move!

01:18.339 --> 01:19.340
Get up.

01:20.819 --> 01:23.170
Open it.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.954
Quickly.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.043
Come on, man!

01:29.001 --> 01:30.568
Give me that.
Okay.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.048
Got it.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.272
James! James!

02:17.093 --> 02:20.270
No, wait...

02:23.621 --> 02:25.841
♪

02:45.730 --> 02:47.819
NELL:
And just...

02:50.692 --> 02:53.260
KENSI:
O-M-G.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.871
I just finished the
Cynicalpodcast in the car.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.090
I cannot believe no one
noticed the mom was a twin.

02:58.134 --> 03:00.354
Come on, how
obvious was that?

03:00.397 --> 03:02.182
Right?
Yeah.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.226
That's-- Yeah.
Awesome.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.967
Yeah. That's wild.
Mm-hmm.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.969
Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.797
I-I should have said
"spoiler alert."

03:08.840 --> 03:10.581
I-I thought we were all on
the same page with this.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.584
No. No. It's-it's not that.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.760
Okay, so what is it?
You recommended it.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.501
We were all talking about it.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.416
Yeah... a year and a half ago.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.114
It's not the first time.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.115
What is...?

03:23.159 --> 03:24.291
It's true.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.771
You come in all gassed up
about old news,

03:26.815 --> 03:28.512
something we've
already discussed,

03:28.556 --> 03:30.732
and then you get upset

03:30.775 --> 03:33.300
when we're not excited,
so, yay.

03:33.343 --> 03:36.607
I do not. I don't get upset.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.131
You're chronically late
to the party.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.916
You know what?
I was gonna ask you guys

03:40.959 --> 03:42.396
to go see Star Wars
this weekend,

03:42.439 --> 03:43.658
I'm just not gonna
do that anymore.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.790
SAM and NELL:
Saw it.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.314
Is it still even in theaters?Definitely not.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.272
You know what? Fine.
I don't care.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.143
I'm just gonna ask Deeks
to come with me.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.015
Deeks.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.887
He saw it already?

03:55.931 --> 03:57.672
He's... I'm gonna kill him.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.761
I'm gonna kill that guy. Way to go, Nell.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.763
Whatever, I don't care.
Where are Callen and Deeks?

04:01.806 --> 04:03.286
'Cause he left
before I woke up this morning.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.201
He probably knows.Uh, Callen is...

04:05.245 --> 04:07.029
talking to ATF
about Anna

04:07.072 --> 04:09.336
and if you'll follow me, I
will tell you where Deeks is.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.251
That's great.
Hey, question.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.296
Wait. Um, so, uh, did
you go see Star Wars?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.342
Um...

04:15.385 --> 04:17.344
Tell me the truth.Well, uh...

04:17.387 --> 04:18.301
You saw Star Wars.NELL: He definitely saw it.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.042
You all saw Star Wars.

04:20.085 --> 04:22.262
No sense of commitment.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.176
Well, a small
cryptocurrency farm

04:24.220 --> 04:25.656
was hit this morning
in San Pedro.

04:25.700 --> 04:29.312
LAPD talked to the owner,
and get this...

04:29.356 --> 04:31.271
the thieves managed to get away

04:31.314 --> 04:34.448
with $10 million worth
of bitcoin.

04:34.491 --> 04:38.060
This guy just left
his partner to die.

04:38.103 --> 04:41.063
I have a question. Uh,
how do you steal bitcoin?

04:41.106 --> 04:45.285
Just to be clear, the thieves
didn't steal actual bitcoin,Right.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.548
they stole the offline keychains
used to access the bitcoin

04:47.591 --> 04:50.333
from cold storage,
in this case, a hard drive.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.857
NELL: Now, the thief
left for dead

04:52.901 --> 04:53.902
is Mark Nichols.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.425
He was treated at UCLA,

04:55.469 --> 04:57.993
and is currently being
transported to the boatshed.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.865
ERIC:
Nichols is a career criminal,
multiple felonies.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.214
Guys are probably
just hired guns.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.433
What does this have
to do with us?

05:03.477 --> 05:05.435
Well, we went back through
the surveillance,

05:05.479 --> 05:08.220
and found this outside
the bitcoin farm.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.875
NELL:
Sasha Channing and Angus Reeves,

05:10.919 --> 05:13.704
both known associates of...

05:13.748 --> 05:15.706
Barris Stone.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.882
Who's Barris Stone?

05:17.926 --> 05:20.407
The most dangerous
narcoterrorist in the game.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.192
Think European
Pablo Escobar.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.890
Mm-hmm. Now, we've clocked
Channing and Reeves,

05:25.934 --> 05:28.850
but no one has seen
Barris Stone enter the U.S.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.591
They could be making moves
without him.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.506
I don't buy it.

05:32.549 --> 05:35.291
If they're here, he's here.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.424
This is our chance to
shut him down for good.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.427
We did spot Sasha entering
this downtown cafe

05:40.470 --> 05:42.254
without Angus. Deeks is there
setting up surveillance.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.300
Callen's gonna meet him.KENSI: She's most likely waiting

05:44.344 --> 05:47.172
to make the exchange with
Nichols' partner that got away.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.392
Okay. So, Kensi,
you take Nell

05:49.436 --> 05:50.872
to the boatshed and
check out Mark Nichols.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.178
Will do.
What are you gonna do?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.530
Something I was hoping
I wouldn't have to.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.753
It's risky.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.364
Barris Stone
was the supplier

06:04.407 --> 06:05.930
behind disgraced
DA Frank Gibson

06:05.974 --> 06:08.890
that I took down
a year ago.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.413
And his partner King.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.762
Yeah.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.721
If Barris Stone
is back town making moves,

06:13.764 --> 06:15.418
then I need to be
in the streets to find him

06:15.462 --> 06:17.725
and using my Switch alias
allows me to do that.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.336
Not if Switch is burned.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.077
Did you know
that after the trial

06:22.120 --> 06:23.513
DA Gibson was murdered

06:23.557 --> 06:25.428
during his transport to prison?

06:25.472 --> 06:27.517
We don't know if Barris Stone
was behind that.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.997
We don't know
that he wasn't.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.130
Switch is still my best option.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.567
Okay.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.525
I'm gonna allow it,

06:35.569 --> 06:37.527
but first you need to make sure

06:37.571 --> 06:39.747
that Switch is still
a viable alias.

06:39.790 --> 06:43.228
You want me to see King.

06:43.272 --> 06:46.231
Talk to her, see what she has to
say. If you feel like it's safe,

06:46.275 --> 06:48.538
then I don't...She's been under
strict supervision.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.453
There's always a way
around that.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.500
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

06:53.543 --> 06:55.676
Yes, you're going out
with Sam today.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.331
Callen's got enough on his plate

06:59.375 --> 07:01.290
and you need someone
watching your back.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.205
And besides, she could use
the extra fieldwork.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.688
Do what you got to do.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.038
But bring Barris Stone in.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.214
Will do.

07:20.396 --> 07:23.094
Hey.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.879
How goes?

07:24.922 --> 07:26.663
Well, she either
has more time to spare

07:26.707 --> 07:29.405
than the average bear,
or she's waiting on a connect.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.280
What are you doing?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.632
I know that you're used
to confiding in Sam,

07:38.675 --> 07:40.938
and I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.680
That's not weird at all.

07:43.724 --> 07:46.248
Well, no. What's weird is that
Anna's under investigation

07:46.291 --> 07:47.858
for killing Sokolov,

07:47.902 --> 07:49.512
and you haven't mentioned it
since it happened.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.035
Well, there's not much
to talk about.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.820
Really?

07:52.863 --> 07:54.952
I'm still trying
to make sense of things.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.171
I get that.

07:56.214 --> 07:57.651
I gave a statement.

07:57.694 --> 08:01.045
They haven't even questioned me
for the investigation.

08:01.089 --> 08:05.093
Now, that is a little weird,
don't you think?

08:05.136 --> 08:06.616
I mean...

08:06.660 --> 08:08.531
as a cop, I'd say
not to worry about it,

08:08.575 --> 08:10.011
'cause these things take time.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.013
Right?

08:12.056 --> 08:13.318
As a lawyer,
I would advise you

08:13.362 --> 08:15.451
to pick a story
and stick with it.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.974
But as your friend,

08:17.018 --> 08:19.194
I would say you got
to follow your heart, man.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.848
'Cause honestly, whatever
it is that you choose

08:20.891 --> 08:23.546
is gonna effect
the rest of her life.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.377
Sam never touches me.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.031
It's too much, right?

08:31.075 --> 08:32.903
Almost nailed it.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.393
Mark Nichols.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.787
Long list of felonies,

08:46.830 --> 08:48.397
in and out of prison...

08:48.440 --> 08:50.181
Wash, rinse, repeat.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.401
Who hired you to hit
that bitcoin farm?

08:52.444 --> 08:54.621
NELL: You know,
blockchain, mining,

08:54.664 --> 08:56.144
cryptographic cash.

08:56.187 --> 08:59.582
My friend here,
she's really smart.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.063
She understands the
likes of bitcoin mining,

09:02.106 --> 09:04.587
cryptographic cash.Yeah, good for her.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.980
Bad for you.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.590
Which means it's
just a matter of time

09:07.634 --> 09:09.505
before she finds out
who hired you.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.029
So why don't you just
go ahead and tell us?

09:12.073 --> 09:13.553
Who was your partner?

09:13.596 --> 09:16.904
Where were you
making the exchange?

09:16.947 --> 09:19.297
Look, you're lucky
to be alive,

09:19.341 --> 09:21.952
especially after your partner
left you to die.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.693
He didn't even try
to come back for you.

09:23.737 --> 09:27.610
Why would you try
to protect him?

09:27.654 --> 09:31.658
You want to know who hired me?

09:31.701 --> 09:34.051
You know the last guy
he thought crossed him

09:34.095 --> 09:37.838
got a gallon of sulfuric acid
forced down his throat.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.580
And he posted
the video online

09:40.623 --> 09:43.321
as the guy burned
from the inside out.

09:43.365 --> 09:46.847
His sick way of saying,
"Don't cross me."

09:46.890 --> 09:48.849
You see, that's who
you're dealing with.

09:48.892 --> 09:52.853
And that's what I'm facing.

09:52.896 --> 09:57.161
Best I can do is to convince him
I kept my mouth shut.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.210
If I'm lucky,
he'll kill me quick.

10:15.745 --> 10:16.746
Goals, right?

10:16.790 --> 10:18.139
Seriously.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.401
How do I look?

10:19.444 --> 10:21.098
Good.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.622
That's one of Hetty's
favorite jackets.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.580
All right. Well, I'll try
not to spill anything on it.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.103
Yeah, you do that.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.453
So what's the plan?

10:28.497 --> 10:31.369
What's the plan--
Oh. You know what?

10:33.067 --> 10:34.459
Ooh.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.505
It's all in the details.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.290
Nice.

10:40.291 --> 10:43.599
So, uh, after King got shot,

10:43.643 --> 10:46.646
she suffered massive
blood loss and a stroke.

10:46.689 --> 10:49.779
I read in her file that she
was in a medically induced coma.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.476
Until she stabilized.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.653
She had to learn to walk
since then.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.785
Wow. She's been through it.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.657
More than you know.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.441
She's got a strong spirit.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.747
Resilient.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.183
Mmm.Let me tell you something.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.011
She testified
against DA Gibson

11:04.054 --> 11:06.274
and laid out the whole structure
of Stone's organization...

11:06.317 --> 11:08.755
Mmm.
...knowing what that
could mean for her.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.931
And in return, she was
offered a lighter sentence

11:10.974 --> 11:12.541
and secret relocation.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.762
Okay.Now I have to meet with her,

11:15.805 --> 11:18.329
see if this Switch
alias is still in play.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.245
It has to be, 'cause I'm not
giving up this outfit.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.291
Yeah, okay.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.293
Boom! That's it.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.818
We are now the proud owners
of a fraction of Ethercoin.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.168
It's gonna be the next
big thing. Just watch.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.779
Youare the proud owner.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.737
I'm not throwing away
my hard-earned cash on that.

11:34.781 --> 11:38.262
I wouldn't exactly call
sitting in a roach coach "hard."

11:38.306 --> 11:39.394
There are a lot of options

11:39.437 --> 11:40.743
if you just want
to throw away your cash.

11:40.787 --> 11:41.831
There are casinos.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.442
Racetracks.
There's backyard dice games.

11:44.486 --> 11:47.402
Tell me,
what exactly did you buy?

11:47.445 --> 11:49.230
I feel like
this is a trick question.

11:49.273 --> 11:50.753
Where is the actual value?

11:50.797 --> 11:52.624
In its demand, baby.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.149
Fear of missing out.
That's what's driving this.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.542
You know what, my friend?
This is the future.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.240
So while you're out there
writing checks

11:59.283 --> 12:01.111
and handwritten letters
by lamplight,

12:01.155 --> 12:03.331
I'll be on the Internets.
That's right, on the Internets.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.767
Buying stuff.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.247
Mm

12:06.290 --> 12:07.770
Oh, look at this!

12:07.814 --> 12:09.250
Up three bucks in,
like, two minutes.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.730
I already made a fortune.
I'm buying more.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.253
All right, but you're not
staying at my place

12:12.296 --> 12:14.908
when Kensi throws you out
for spending all your cash.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.344
What the cr...?

12:16.387 --> 12:18.259
What

12:19.303 --> 12:21.262
It just crashed, didn't it?

12:21.305 --> 12:23.438
Yes.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.918
Oh, my God. I think
I owe them money.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.093
Oh, she's moving.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.530
Well, Vanilla Ice,

12:28.573 --> 12:30.140
the Pet Rock,

12:30.184 --> 12:31.707
and Ethercoin at $200.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.405
What are three things people
thought were here to stay?

12:46.156 --> 12:48.811
I don't know what I like better,
this outfit or the car.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.987
Hmm.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.989
Give me a minute.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.165
Take your time.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.435
Hey.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.395
You look like this guy
that I used to know.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.490
New me?

13:16.534 --> 13:18.449
Coworker.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.843
Yeah.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.803
It is good to see you.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.720
It's good to see you, too.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.204
It's too quiet out here.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.293
I miss the city.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.340
The only thing that
made this tolerable

13:39.383 --> 13:41.646
were your visits.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.302
I always wanted to ask you...

13:45.346 --> 13:48.088
after you got
the information you needed,

13:48.131 --> 13:50.133
why keep coming?

13:50.177 --> 13:52.309
You know why.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.139
I do.

13:56.183 --> 13:59.360
Just trying to remind myself
that I'm not crazy.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.536
You're not.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.321
I miss you.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.758
I miss you, too.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.891
Look at you.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.023
Oh.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.329
Back to normal.No, not there yet.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.375
But close.Hmm.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.811
Can't walk right without it.Hmm.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.421
Want a little help?No, I'm good. I got it.

14:17.465 --> 14:18.858
Oh, okay.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.348
You okay?

14:31.392 --> 14:33.176
I am now, Dana.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.353
I have hated that name
my whole life,

14:36.397 --> 14:39.617
but somehow when you say it,

14:39.661 --> 14:41.619
it doesn't sound so bad.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.665
Hmm.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.407
Hmm.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.628
Listen...

14:50.672 --> 14:52.935
I need to ask you something.Hmm?

14:56.983 --> 14:59.289
Did you tell anyone about me?

15:02.510 --> 15:04.555
About Switch?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.819
After everything
that we've shared?

15:07.863 --> 15:10.170
My rehab, the tri...

15:10.213 --> 15:12.781
You confided in me about
your wife's death.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.352
I need to know.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.706
Wouldn't want to jeopardize
my cushy deal,

15:24.749 --> 15:26.186
now, would I?

15:27.274 --> 15:29.580
You know, I didn't
say a word.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.931
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.978
Look, I care about my deal,

15:36.022 --> 15:37.588
but I care about you more.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.677
I don't want anything
to happen to you, Sam.

15:39.721 --> 15:40.983
In a weird way,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.985
you...

15:43.029 --> 15:44.987
you're all I have.

15:49.035 --> 15:52.212
I assume you're
asking for a reason.

15:52.255 --> 15:55.345
There's a chance Barris Stone
might be in the U.S.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.395
We're not certain.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.657
Am I in danger?Oh.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.788
No, no, no, no.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.399
You don't have anything
to worry about.

16:05.442 --> 16:08.228
But if he found me...No. You're safe here.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.752
And I'm gonna find him first.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.452
Okay.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.415
But there's got to be
something you can tell me.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.982
You know, uh...

16:23.025 --> 16:24.766
a pattern.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.724
Anything.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.772
Yeah.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.296
Yeah, there was
an emergency once,

16:33.340 --> 16:35.429
and we ended up meeting...

16:35.472 --> 16:38.301
by the old shipyard
by the harbor.

16:40.347 --> 16:43.350
I need that address.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.135
I got you.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.138
I got you.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.011
I got you.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.631
Look, we know you're
scared, okay?

17:03.674 --> 17:04.936
But we need to know.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.547
Are you working
for Barris Stone?

17:06.590 --> 17:07.809
NELL: And
if you are,

17:07.852 --> 17:10.986
please let us
help you.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.683
There's no way you can help me.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.337
We are very resourceful.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.339
Witness protection.
Secret secure locations...

17:16.383 --> 17:18.124
There's nowhere you can put me
that they won't find me.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.560
KENSI:
Here's the deal.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.562
You can take your chances
with us

17:21.605 --> 17:24.086
and tell us who your partner is
and who hired you, or...

17:24.130 --> 17:25.348
Or we can lock you up
in gen pop,

17:25.392 --> 17:27.133
and you can take your chances

17:27.176 --> 17:29.178
with whoever it is
you're terrified of.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.184
Seems like a pretty
easy call to me.

17:37.186 --> 17:40.233
Sasha Channing hired us.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.105
Here?

17:43.149 --> 17:44.367
Yeah, that's her.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.716
Who else was at the meeting?

17:47.762 --> 17:49.372
There was another guy.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.808
Reeves.
NELL:
Mm-hmm.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.636
Here?

17:53.985 --> 17:55.291
Anybody else?

17:55.335 --> 17:59.078
There was this guy
creeping around the back.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.470
Didn't want to be seen.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.692
Yeah, that's him.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.217
And I'd never seen
Sasha defer to anyone

18:08.261 --> 18:10.132
the way she did with him.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.222
I mean, we were up for running
his L.A. distribution.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.138
To prove ourselves,
we had to deliver that drive.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.575
Who is your partner?

18:18.619 --> 18:21.012
The hell.

18:21.056 --> 18:24.015
Jerk left me for dead, anyway.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.061
Eddy Davis.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.063
Goes by E-Money.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.109
Thank you.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.163
We're early.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.513
For?

18:43.557 --> 18:45.776
If we're gonna get close
to Stone,

18:45.820 --> 18:47.343
we got to bring something
to the table.

18:47.387 --> 18:48.997
You mean cash?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.130
Something like that.

18:53.393 --> 18:56.352
You and King seem... close.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.485
It's complicated.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.356
Complicated feelings?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.576
More like respect.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.273
She's been through a lot.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.406
So have you.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.103
And Sam,
no one would blame you if...

19:08.147 --> 19:09.235
As much as we'd like

19:09.278 --> 19:11.411
to believe it...

19:11.454 --> 19:13.500
everything isn't
black and white.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.851
Nobody's all good
or all bad.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.331
We all have flaws.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.898
We all have virtues.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.684
Comes down to choices.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.385
My husband used to say that.

19:32.432 --> 19:35.565
I was in Afghanistan,
and I got summoned by my CO.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.481
The next thing I know,
I'm being flown

19:38.525 --> 19:42.485
to a nearby combat support
hospital in Kandahar.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.531
When I got there...

19:46.533 --> 19:48.448
...he was in...

19:48.491 --> 19:50.493
he was in really bad shape.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.717
Something came over me, and...

19:56.760 --> 19:59.023
I proposed to him right there.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.376
I was so scared.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.249
Someone called the chaplain,

20:07.293 --> 20:10.252
and he married us
right there on the spot.

20:12.646 --> 20:16.040
He died shortly after
on the table.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.349
I didn't know.

20:20.393 --> 20:23.352
You know,
I may be out of line, but...

20:23.396 --> 20:26.094
I think it's okay to feel.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.923
You perform like a superhero,

20:28.966 --> 20:31.534
but you cannot forget
that you're human.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.104
So, do you believe her?

20:36.147 --> 20:37.714
About Stone?

20:39.455 --> 20:41.892
No choice.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.677
Switch is our best option

20:43.720 --> 20:46.288
if we want to get close to Stone
before he skips town.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.290
Okay.
So what are we doing here?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.161
Well...

20:50.205 --> 20:52.686
visiting an old friend.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.261
SAM:
Champ!

21:02.304 --> 21:04.045
Caught you slipping
again, big boy.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.220
Switch?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.265
You can't be serious.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.831
You can't jack a man twice.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.877
It's against the code.What code is that?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.227
The code that says you can't
jack a man twice code.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.228
It's against the rules.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.144
I make my own rules.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.059
Give up the case.

21:18.102 --> 21:20.061
Give it up-- easy.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.978
Easy, easy.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.980
Don't give me a reason.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.809
Don't be stupid.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.201
For real, for real?

21:30.245 --> 21:32.421
You got some balls
showing up here, player.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.380
Man, shut up, man. Get the case.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.166
Open it.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.259
Oh, that's cute.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.654
Where's the real
stuff, huh?

21:47.697 --> 21:49.786
I don't know what
you talking about.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.222
Where's the real stuff?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.965
SAM: Yeah, sting
a little bit?

21:55.009 --> 21:58.360
Still got your tricks doing
your dirty work, I see.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.144
Give it up.

22:00.188 --> 22:03.234
SAM: Where's the real
stuff, tough guy?

22:03.278 --> 22:05.889
Hmm?

22:05.933 --> 22:07.326
Aha.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.241
That looks more like it.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.722
I'd like to thank you
for another contribution

22:12.766 --> 22:14.594
to the Switch charity fund.

22:14.637 --> 22:17.205
You know this is gonna come down
between you and me, Switch.

22:17.248 --> 22:18.467
And you ain't gonna like

22:18.511 --> 22:19.599
the outcome.

22:19.642 --> 22:20.643
HIDOKO:
Look out!

22:38.966 --> 22:42.839
You ain't getting away
this time, Switch.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.450
Your ass is mine!

22:45.015 --> 22:45.973
I've been praying
for this moment.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.064
Let's go!

22:50.107 --> 22:51.195
Let's roll!

22:52.066 --> 22:53.415
Damn you, Switch!

22:53.459 --> 22:55.025
Got what we needed.

22:55.069 --> 22:58.725
More importantly, we know Switch
is still a viable alias.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.048
["Hey Mama"
by Nathaniel Rateliff playing]

23:22.966 --> 23:25.055
I'm starting to think this, uh,
Eddy Davis isn't gonna show.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.579
Well, he doesn't have
any other choice.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.885
Doesn't have the means

playing it safe.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.890
You know, this place makes me
rethink my career choices.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.196
Couple beers.

hang out and and relax

23:37.416 --> 23:39.722

like this all day long?

23:39.766 --> 23:41.855
Don't know if I would call this
a "fine establishment."

23:41.898 --> 23:42.943
What are you talking about?

23:42.986 --> 23:44.248
You got darts,
you got neon signs,

23:44.292 --> 23:46.642
you got that sticky film
on the fake wood floors.

23:46.686 --> 23:47.730
This place is awesome.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.036

my eye on a place

over on the east side.

it's waiting on me to buy it.

Mm-hmm. And how's Kensi feel

24:02.484 --> 24:03.920
about being married
to a bartender?

24:03.964 --> 24:06.619
Well, first off,
I prefer the term "mixologist,"

24:06.662 --> 24:08.229

I haven't told her, yet.

longer can we roll the dice?

your nerves speaking.

24:21.068 --> 24:23.287
No, it's not, man,
it's me thinking ahead.

24:23.331 --> 24:27.117
To be honest, I think
that we've gotten lucky so far.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.946
And I-I want to, you know,
I want to have kids, man,

24:29.990 --> 24:31.121
I want a family.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.689
Sam made it work.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.954
I mean, not to be insensitive,

24:37.998 --> 24:39.478
but considering
what happened to Michelle,

24:39.521 --> 24:40.957
you're proving my point.

24:41.001 --> 24:43.438
That's just not
a conversation

24:43.482 --> 24:46.093
I'm prepared to have

24:46.136 --> 24:48.530
Yeah.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.103
Got over a half a million

26:23.146 --> 26:24.713
That should be more
than enough to purchase

26:24.757 --> 26:26.280
a few minutes of face time.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.064
And what's stopping me
from just taking it?

26:28.108 --> 26:30.632
You could, but that'd be
no way to treat a lady.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.417

Kensi and Nell are on overwatch.

26:54.090 --> 26:57.790
And, um, Callen and Deeks are
currently sitting

26:57.833 --> 27:00.401

27:00.444 --> 27:02.055
...waiting for Davis to come
through with the key codes.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.187
No luck locating Davis?

27:04.231 --> 27:05.841
No. Not yet.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.714
I've been backtracking
since the robbery. Nothing.

27:08.757 --> 27:12.674
Well, he could be spooked
after dropping two dead bodies.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.982
Okay. Keep me updated
as things progress.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.644
Two questions.Hmm.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.821
Who are you, and how'd you know
where to find me?

27:28.864 --> 27:29.778
My name is Switch.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.606
This is my partner, CJ.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.042
Never heard of you.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.262
Well, if you had, it means
we're not doing our jobs.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.743
SAM: You can't
trust Mark Nichols

27:37.786 --> 27:39.658
and Eddy Davis.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.791
Two idiots couldn't
pull off a simple robbery.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.533
And you're lucky
Nichols got shot,

27:45.576 --> 27:47.448
'cause he was planning
to skip town.

27:47.491 --> 27:49.624
He wanted me to go in with him,

27:49.668 --> 27:51.670
but I don't roll like that.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.934
When I heard who
the job was for,

27:54.977 --> 27:56.239
I saw an opportunity.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.632
Hmm.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.723
So you show up at the door
with a bag of diamonds.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.683
It's the best housewarming
gift I could think of.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.728
Next to cash.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.736

28:14.780 --> 28:16.607
Nichols and
Davis...

28:16.651 --> 28:19.393
...can't do for you
what we can do for you.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.569
That half a mill
is every week for us.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.049
SAM: The possibilities
are endless.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.267
Every week?

28:24.311 --> 28:25.965
From Diego to the Bay.

28:26.008 --> 28:28.358
We got the West Coast on lock.

28:28.402 --> 28:31.579
Sounds impressive.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.842
Especially for a federal agent.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.496
No!

29:03.437 --> 29:05.787

30:06.892 --> 30:08.067
Yeah, it should.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.242
You've been shot.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.330
But your jacket's
lined with Kevlar.

30:10.373 --> 30:11.592
You should be okay.

30:14.682 --> 30:17.293
They knew.

30:17.337 --> 30:19.295
They knew we were feds.

30:19.339 --> 30:22.559

30:23.996 --> 30:25.867

media feed, Kaleidoscope,
keep coming up short.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.012

30:40.055 --> 30:42.710

30:42.753 --> 30:44.407

the best in the game,

30:44.451 --> 30:46.540

who can do what you do,

30:46.583 --> 30:49.717

it's you.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.675

30:51.719 --> 30:53.982

was deliver you.

31:30.845 --> 31:33.761

the Barris Stone organization.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.154

Sam is the most
thorough person we know.

There's no way he's dealing
with someone like King

33:59.037 --> 34:00.690
without some sort
of contingency plan.

34:00.734 --> 34:01.778
What do you mean?

34:01.822 --> 34:02.910
I'm picking up an extra signal

34:02.953 --> 34:05.565
on the network
from your location.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.741
Could it be Sam's phone?

34:07.784 --> 34:09.438
No, no, I have Sam's phone
right here.

34:09.482 --> 34:11.005

34:11.049 --> 34:13.834

34:33.506 --> 34:34.681
It's a burner.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.074
He was tracking something.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.336
Eric, we need a chopper.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.728
I'm on it.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.426
Nice work, Eric.

34:41.905 --> 34:44.647
Chopper's on its way.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.656
I got eyes on Sasha and Davis.

34:53.700 --> 34:54.831
ERIC:
Copy that.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.877
Where is it?

35:06.930 --> 35:09.107
I didn't think
you had it in you.

35:11.239 --> 35:12.022
Federal agent, drop your weapon!

35:12.066 --> 35:12.849
Don't!

35:14.199 --> 35:15.069
We got a runner!

35:17.202 --> 35:18.986
Oh! God, that was
the perfect check.

35:19.029 --> 35:20.553
On your knees.

35:20.596 --> 35:21.771
Hands behind your back.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.252
DEEKS:
Hey.

35:24.296 --> 35:25.253
We good?

35:26.298 --> 35:28.126
We got the key codes.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.866
Now we get Sam.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.739
Beale, I need LAPD
at this location.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.406
Perfect.

35:47.449 --> 35:48.842
Fire it up.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.063
REEVES:
Good to go.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.762
It's all about social media
these days, huh?

35:55.805 --> 35:59.287
We have to use the tools
available to us to stay on top.

35:59.331 --> 36:04.466
If you die well,
this could go viral.

36:06.207 --> 36:08.731
Are you gonna keep talking,
or are we gonna do this?

36:10.994 --> 36:12.300
I do like this guy.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.477
It's almost a shame
to see him go.

36:15.521 --> 36:16.913
Hmm.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.741
Let me do it.

36:19.873 --> 36:21.831
Ah.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.398
It's kind of poetic.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.662
Dana, wait.

36:36.803 --> 36:40.720
Like I said, you talk too much.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.420
Here.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.254
Step aside, Sam.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.953
Look, I'm sorry.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.738
The only way for me
to get close enough to Stone

36:58.781 --> 37:00.392
was to deliver you.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.655
It's the only way
for me to be free.

37:02.698 --> 37:06.485
I'm gonna start a new life,
and I want you to come with me.

37:06.528 --> 37:09.270
I can't let you do this, Dana.

37:10.532 --> 37:13.231
After everything
we've been through...

37:13.274 --> 37:16.103
we deserve this.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.105
Tell me you don't want to go.

37:21.543 --> 37:24.416
I absolutely want to go.

37:26.679 --> 37:29.464
But I can't.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.947
I can't run away from who I am.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.906
[sirens wailing,
helicopter whirring]

37:36.950 --> 37:38.908
What?

37:38.952 --> 37:40.954
How? Did...

37:43.348 --> 37:45.828
The farmhouse.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.047
Where'd you put the tracker?

37:47.090 --> 37:49.745
Your brace.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.921
So you used me to get to Stone.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.837
Guess that makes two of us.

37:54.881 --> 37:57.623
How'd you know
I wouldn't kill you?

37:57.666 --> 38:00.234
I didn't.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.586
But I know how I feel about you.

38:04.630 --> 38:09.243
And I was counting on you
feeling the same way.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.247
I'm not going back.

38:23.649 --> 38:26.608
I wish things could've
been different.

38:26.652 --> 38:27.653
I know. Me, too...

38:33.615 --> 38:34.573
Dana!

38:34.616 --> 38:35.574
Federal agents!

38:35.617 --> 38:36.662
DEEKS: Gun
down, now!

38:36.705 --> 38:38.272
Put down your weapon.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.100
Don't...

38:40.143 --> 38:42.972
Dana.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.060
Dana.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.236
Give me the gun.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.629
Give me the gun.

38:53.548 --> 38:54.723
KENSI:
Medic!

39:03.558 --> 39:05.168
Mm-mm.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.562
You'll be okay.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.608
It's gonna be okay.

39:26.668 --> 39:28.540
KENSI: Callen and
Deeks are processing

39:28.583 --> 39:29.976
Sasha Channing
and Eddy Davis.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.412
Barris Stone is out of surgery,

39:31.456 --> 39:33.588
and in custody
with the marshals.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.808
Hidoko?

39:35.851 --> 39:38.245
HIDOKO:
Bruised ribs.

39:38.288 --> 39:39.638
I think I'm gonna
be sore for a week.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.554
Try three.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.558
Remind me to thank
Hetty for that jacket.

39:48.168 --> 39:49.517
You good?

39:49.561 --> 39:50.605
Mm-hmm.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.172
We good?

39:52.215 --> 39:53.521
Yeah.

39:53.565 --> 39:54.566
We're good.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.045
Get some rest.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.612
You earned it.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.354
Thanks.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.442
Bye.

40:01.486 --> 40:02.574
Hey, have a good night.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.227
HIDOKO:
Night.

40:12.627 --> 40:14.890
To be honest, um...

40:14.934 --> 40:17.719
I'm not thrilled with
how you played this one.

40:17.763 --> 40:20.418
You put Hidoko's life in danger.

40:23.203 --> 40:26.293
"Do what you got to do," right?

40:26.336 --> 40:29.296
You know better than anyone,
it gets real out there.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.430
How did you know?

40:34.649 --> 40:36.390
I knew King
was the only one

40:36.434 --> 40:38.523
that could get
close enough to Stone.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.568
And nothing was gonna stop her.

40:42.614 --> 40:45.312
Apparently,
even if that meant using me.

40:45.355 --> 40:49.185
You're not answering
my question.

40:52.188 --> 40:55.148
I guess I used my instincts.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.716
You mean, your heart?

41:02.503 --> 41:05.419
Look, Sam, I get it.

41:05.463 --> 41:10.076
Sometimes, you have to
play outside the lines.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.688
Good work.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.519
Good night, EAD Mosley.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.786
Sam?

41:26.701 --> 41:30.009
I will do everything
I can do to help her.

41:30.052 --> 41:33.665
But whatever's going on with
you, you need to figure it out.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.625
Do you get what I'm saying?
