WEBVTT

00:05.973 --> 00:08.542
Previously on ER.

00:08.576 --> 00:09.543
Just you please
slow down!

00:09.577 --> 00:11.079
Look out!

00:11.112 --> 00:12.313
You need structure
and stability.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.481
Let go.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.083
Someone you can rely on
and trust.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.717
That's not you anymore, okay?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.553
Syphilis is not a word
the voters love to hear.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.456
Any way we can keep it
out of my medical record?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.258
The alderman--
did we ever get his labs back?

00:24.292 --> 00:25.359
They're negative.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.494
He could have
untreated syphilis.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.728
He's fine.
Let it go.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.330
CARTER:
Looks like

00:29.363 --> 00:30.598
you could use some new
equipment around here.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.600
What's this?
White, liberal guilt?

00:32.633 --> 00:33.634
Probably.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.404
No, thanks.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.705
He survived

00:37.738 --> 00:39.473
a nine-millimeter
bullet to the brain.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.742
His IQ dropped
about 40 points.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.211
What were you doing with
Dukey and those boys?

00:43.244 --> 00:44.578
Did they just hurt you?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.280
Yo, Biz, let me talk to you
for a minute.

00:46.314 --> 00:51.419
Stay away from him.
You understand that?

00:51.452 --> 00:54.555
WOMAN:
He tried climbing a giant ficus
in our living room.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.756
Sit back.

00:55.789 --> 00:56.757
Ooh!

00:56.790 --> 00:57.825
No biting. Bad monkey.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.227
His psychiatrist says

00:59.260 --> 01:01.362
that letting Zavery
act out his impulses

01:01.395 --> 01:03.331
allows him to better
express himself.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.498
Is he on any
medication?

01:04.532 --> 01:06.200
Oh, he has
an asthma inhaler,

01:06.234 --> 01:09.137
but he hasn't been using that
the last couple of days.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.605
not since he entered
his simian role-playing phase.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.141
Dr. Lewis, could you
help me with this?

01:13.174 --> 01:14.675
Six-foot fall, possible
corneal abrasion.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.444
Uh, yeah,
put him in Exam Two.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.579
I'll be there in a minute.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.214
How you doing, Aidan?

01:20.248 --> 01:22.150
You know the opening goes
in the back, right?

01:22.183 --> 01:24.285
Right.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.786
Oh, you're a wrestler.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.455
Yeah.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.789
Seems to be
working for you.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.492
Thanks.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.760
What do you do?

01:32.793 --> 01:34.628
I'm a doctor.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.164
No, I mean,
to stay in shape.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.798
Oh. I, uh, I do these.

01:37.831 --> 01:38.766
Bicep curls.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.800
Mm-hmm.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.402
How much?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.570
Sometimes I can lift

01:42.603 --> 01:44.172
a whole pitcher
of margaritas.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.573
Bastards.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.341
It's from the
cigarettes, isn't it?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.642
Probably.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.312
The biopsy reveals
small cell carcinoma.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.882
The x rays show
metastatic spread.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.418
I need you to write me up
a full disclosure

01:57.451 --> 02:00.188
so I can file a lawsuit
against tobacco companies.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.590
Mr. Carmichael,
you've been smoking cigarettes

02:02.623 --> 02:04.192
since you were a teenager.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.493
So?

02:05.526 --> 02:07.628
So you might take some
responsibility for that.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.863
Instead of looking
for someone else to blame,

02:09.896 --> 02:12.766
you should be concentrating
on how to manage your disease,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.203
make the most out of the time
you have left.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.570
I get it.

02:16.604 --> 02:19.207
This is just the HMOs
and big business

02:19.240 --> 02:20.808
covering each other's asses.

02:20.841 --> 02:21.942
Well, screw you, pal.

02:21.975 --> 02:22.876
I'll see you in court.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.245
No, you won't.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.613
( coughing ):
Oh, yeah?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.315
You don't think I
won't sue you, too?

02:27.348 --> 02:30.351
You're not going
to live that long.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.585
What was that all about?

02:31.619 --> 02:32.720
Stupidity.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.788
On whose part,
his or yours?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.524
What is it
with this country?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.726
Nobody takes responsibility
for anything.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.562
Always looking for someone else
to blame, someone to sue.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.697
You don't like it,
go back to Croatia.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.366
Not near as many lawyers.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.934
Lot more land mines, though.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.837
22-year-old female, head injury.
BP: 90/60; pulse: 110.

02:49.870 --> 02:50.804
What's her name?

02:50.838 --> 02:51.572
Brenda Walton.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.740
Weaver!

02:52.773 --> 02:54.808
Hey, don't
start, Robert.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.511
I got a full...

02:57.545 --> 02:58.979
Who knew you were
such a conniving,

02:59.012 --> 03:00.281
manipulative seductress?

03:00.314 --> 03:01.582
Well, I did, actually,

03:01.615 --> 03:03.284
but you have out-Weavered
yourself this time.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.718
What are you
talking about?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.587
We were just allotted
$2.4 million in new funding.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.688
What?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.257
Yeah, you remember
Alderman Bright?

03:09.257 --> 03:10.591
He was in here
a couple of weeks ago,

03:10.624 --> 03:11.625
and somehow your
team of miscreants

03:11.659 --> 03:12.926
managed to not kill him.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.562
I know, I am as surprised
as you are.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.330
Well, he must have been
impressed with County.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.798
Yeah, either that
or the prostate massage.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.767
In any case, he's coming
by this afternoon with a...

03:19.800 --> 03:20.834
What are you
talking about?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.303
...a camera crew
for a photo-op,

03:22.336 --> 03:23.837
so make sure you broom
all these degenerates

03:23.871 --> 03:25.005
before he gets here, okay?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.640
Hey, these patients
are precisely why

03:26.674 --> 03:27.875
we're getting this funding.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.343
Don't ruin this for me.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.280
( exhaling )

03:32.280 --> 03:34.315
Open up, G, open up!

03:34.348 --> 03:35.849
Use your key.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.651
I don't have it.
Come on! It's an emergency.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.887
All right, all right.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.854
G!

03:40.888 --> 03:41.855
Stop pounding.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.358
Stop pounding!

03:44.392 --> 03:45.593
What?

03:45.626 --> 03:46.627
Get your doctor stuff!

03:46.660 --> 03:47.928
Biz hurt. He's hurt bad!

03:47.961 --> 03:49.297
What happened to him?

03:49.330 --> 03:50.398
I got shot, man.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.699
Who shot him?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.534
I don't know!
It happened so fast!

03:53.567 --> 03:55.002
Fix him up, G!
Like you fixed me.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.637
I can't.
He has a chest wound.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.805
I have to get him
to the hospital.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.640
I need to call 9-1-1.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.742
No hospitals, man.
They're going to be
looking for me.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.344
Who? The police?

04:03.377 --> 04:04.312
What the hell happened, Leon?

04:04.312 --> 04:05.646
It was an accident!

04:05.679 --> 04:06.947
We were going to take
some beers and stuff

04:06.980 --> 04:07.948
from the liquor store.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.750
This was a robbery?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.719
But the security
guard showed up

04:11.752 --> 04:13.721
and people just
started shooting!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.323
Listen to me, go inside
and close the door.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.324
Do not come out.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.690
Do not look out the window.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.692
Anybody comes by,
don't answer the door.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.329
You understand me? Leon!

04:23.000 --> 04:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.947 --> 05:15.483
That's what I like to see:
med students hitting the books.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.784
What are you reading?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.687
Uh, Tintinalli--
acute abdominal pain.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.522
Tintinalli?

05:21.555 --> 05:23.957
Read Zachary Cope's early
diagnosis of the acute abdomen.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.459
He wrote it 80 years ago

05:25.493 --> 05:27.060
and nothing has changed.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.399
( clicks tongue ):
Damn it.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.901
You, uh, you okay, sir?

05:33.934 --> 05:34.902
Yeah, yeah.

05:34.935 --> 05:35.903
No, I got it.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.137
I got it.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.672
All right, I'll, uh

05:38.706 --> 05:40.841
I'll get housekeeping
to mop it up.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.418
Please just get it off!

05:50.451 --> 05:52.586
We will.
Just try and relax, Brenda.

05:52.620 --> 05:56.757
Okay, let's start with ten
of morphine and a gram of Ancef.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.026
She was demonstrating
the cruelty of fur trapping

05:59.059 --> 06:00.694
at the university.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.129
Good thing you didn't
try to chew it off.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.931
Is that a joke?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.534
Do you know how many animals
suffer needless, painful deaths

06:06.567 --> 06:08.536
every year in the name
of the fur trade?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.604
Will you help me open this?

06:10.638 --> 06:12.773
Sure.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.074
Thanks.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.444
So... what's it
going to be, huh?

06:16.444 --> 06:17.878
Chechnya or the Congo?

06:17.911 --> 06:18.879
Oh, um...

06:18.912 --> 06:20.781
still thinking about it.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.983
Thinking about what?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.518
Carter's going away

06:24.552 --> 06:27.187
with Alliance de
Medicine Internacionale.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.022
Really?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.992
Uh... something I'm thinking
about doing for the spring.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.193
Oh, he's going.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.596
I've done it three times

06:35.629 --> 06:36.964
and it makes
what we do here

06:36.997 --> 06:38.532
look like...
I don't know.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.467
Okay, got this?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.168
Yeah, thanks.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.605
( metallic clank )

06:44.638 --> 06:45.906
I'll be right back.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.011
I've been doing PT every day
since I came out of surgery.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.513
Recovery ebbs and flows.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.648
Patience and attitude
can be just as important

06:54.682 --> 06:55.949
during rehab as ...

06:55.983 --> 06:57.651
Look, don't give me
any of that crap.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.620
I'm losing what
little strength I had,

06:59.653 --> 07:01.154
and sensory function
is nonexistent.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.055
What do you want,
Robert?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.491
Your limb was severed.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.158
Hey, I'm not some
poor schmuck

07:05.192 --> 07:06.927
who's worried about how's
he's going to be able

07:06.960 --> 07:08.762
to hold his beer can while
he whacks away watching TV.

07:08.796 --> 07:09.930
I want my arm back.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.832
It's a miracle
of modern medicine

07:11.865 --> 07:13.100
that you have what you do.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.504
Chechnya?

07:16.537 --> 07:18.806
Yeah, we talked about this.

07:18.839 --> 07:19.973
No, we didn't.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.575
Yeah, remember
that time that I said

07:21.609 --> 07:23.511
I thought I'd like
to practice medicine abroad?

07:23.544 --> 07:24.645
Yeah.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.846
Well...

07:25.879 --> 07:27.047
I thought you meant
Paris or something.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.016
Well, they desperately
need doctors.

07:29.049 --> 07:29.983
So do we.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.785
What's that stink?

07:31.819 --> 07:34.087
Dr. Lewis got hit
with flying feces.
Ah.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.590
You know, I find a clipboard
is a good shield

07:36.624 --> 07:37.991
for projectile body fluids.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.893
Thanks for the tip
and for the sweater.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.995
Abby, can you set
up a Wood's lamp

07:42.029 --> 07:43.931
for my monkey boy's
corneal abrasion?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.232
He still armed and dangerous?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.900
I think
he's out of ammo.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.102
Hey, Dr. Carter,
your doctor friend's in triage.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.538
McNulty?

07:50.538 --> 07:51.539
Yeah, he must've
wandered in.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.073
He seems altered.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.976
Doreen Brant, 32, took a header
down a flight of stairs.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.846
Abby, can you give this to Luka?
I have to change.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.180
Sure, Curtain Three.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.682
BP: 124/72; pulse: 96.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.583
MAN:
Is he here?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.084
Who?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.286
Sutter. One of our guys was shot
during a robbery attempt.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.821
They said they were
bringing him here.

08:07.855 --> 08:08.989
Frank?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.958
Got a shooting
victim en route,

08:10.991 --> 08:12.860
but nobody said
he was a cop.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.695
Maybe they were bringing
him in a squad car.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.629
Can you check dispatch?

08:15.663 --> 08:16.964
Sure, I'm on it.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.265
ROMANO:
Who summoned
a surgical consult?

08:18.298 --> 08:20.100
You're here for a consult?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.835
No, I heard Weaver
was teaching a
Jazzercise class

08:21.869 --> 08:23.303
out in the Ambulance Bay.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.105
Okay, okay, I didn't know
you were doing this again.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.740
You don't have
to jump all over me.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.708
Don't even.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.042
Wouldn't think of it.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.712
Aidan Fenwick,
this is Dr. Romano.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.081
Aidan developed a gluteal
abscess on his right buttock.

08:34.114 --> 08:34.982
Aha.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.150
Oh! I'll say.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.019
You been using steroids?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.153
I was.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.955
He stopped.
Not soon enough.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.957
If you enjoy
having testicles
bigger than raisins,

08:43.991 --> 08:46.026
I'd suggest you don't start
using again.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.327
I was going to drain
it hit here,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.096
but I could feel a deep
perirectal component.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.998
Oh, we all know what a pain in
the ass that can be. Good call.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.601
Aidan, your infection
has spread up along
your rectum,

08:53.634 --> 08:54.935
so we're going to be taking you
up to the OR.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.706
I need surgery?

08:58.739 --> 08:59.707
We can't do it here.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.674
Do you want me
to get Corday?

09:00.708 --> 09:02.042
Nope, I got this.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.211
Who's going to do
the actual surgery?

09:04.244 --> 09:05.813
I will be supervising
one of my residents.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.180
Hey, you, give me a hand.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.682
Yeah, that's what
I was worried about.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.050
Officer Jason Sutter, 39.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.852
BP's holding at 100/74
after two liters.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.086
How many times
was he hit?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.888
Two entry wounds
that I could see.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.356
I heard four shots,
felt two hits.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.025
.22, .25 caliber.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.093
Hurts like hell
all the way down my leg.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.028
Pulse is regular at 106.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.195
Gave him eight of MS.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.064
Any pain in your chest
or head?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.999
No. Somebody call Jenny.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.768
You can call yourself
in a few minutes.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.736
Hang in there, Hoss.

09:28.769 --> 09:29.903
Okay, Susan, page Corday.

09:29.937 --> 09:30.871
Okay.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.072
CARTER:
Mental status?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.140
He's oriented times two.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.207
Dr. McNulty?

09:34.241 --> 09:37.110
Hey, Mac, you know
where you are?

09:37.144 --> 09:37.911
I got patients.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.747
He might be in DKA.

09:39.780 --> 09:43.050
Let's bolus a liter of saline,
CBC, chem 7, serum ketones, UA.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.752
He's got a pulse of 130,
BP: 90/60.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.153
Hey, Mac, have
you been vomiting?

09:46.186 --> 09:47.054
Do you have a fever?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.388
Just a cold.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.223
Dr. Carter, we have another
hot GSW rolling in.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.391
Be right there.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.060
Accu check is over 400.
Damn it!

09:53.093 --> 09:57.798
You have to stop jumping around,
Zavery. Zavery!

09:57.831 --> 09:59.867
Where's mom?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.334
She had to make
a phone call.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.137
Yeah, to the adoption
agency if she's smart.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.639
Proparacaine drops are in.

10:05.673 --> 10:06.740
Zavery,

10:06.774 --> 10:08.976
would you please come out now?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.143
Forget it.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.112
I can't use
the gorilla-scope

10:12.145 --> 10:13.080
if you won't come out.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.347
LOCKHART:
Oh, right.

10:14.381 --> 10:18.051
We'll have to bring it back
to the zoo.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.188
Zavery, can you lie still
while we look in your eye?

10:21.221 --> 10:22.289
( grunting )

10:22.322 --> 10:23.290
Okay.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.092
Okay.

10:25.125 --> 10:30.163
I'm going to put some yellow
banana medicine in your eye...

10:30.197 --> 10:31.799
see if you scratched it.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.201
Okay, now blink your eye.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.104
All right.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.140
No corneal abrasions.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.009
No signs of scratching.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.010
Susan?

10:43.043 --> 10:44.011
What?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.078
Your sweater.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.715
Oh, my God.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.249
Is that semen?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.318
This isn't my sweater.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.155
Oh, gross.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.958
22-year-old
African American male,

10:57.991 --> 11:01.995
gunshot wound
to the left chest.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.097
Parasternal GSW to the third
left intercostal space.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.099
Tubed for agonal resps.
What are you doing
with this?

11:06.133 --> 11:06.734
I found him.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.835
Where?

11:07.868 --> 11:08.902
What difference
does it make?

11:08.936 --> 11:10.037
I'm being a
good Samaritan.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.271
You got a problem
with that?

11:11.304 --> 11:14.007
Pulse is up to 110
with two liters.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.408
He needs a chest tube.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.077
This guy
a friend of yours?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.746
We're not all related,
you know.

11:18.746 --> 11:19.446
He's tachy at 120.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.114
Let's type and cross

11:21.148 --> 11:23.250
for four units and get two
units of O-neg going.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.451
All right,
sterile gloves.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.919
Prep the left side.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.188
I need a thoraseal
with a cell saver.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.757
Pulse ox 95 on 100%.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.125
Pupils are four millimeters
and reactive.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.293
What's his name?

11:33.326 --> 11:34.995
I don't know.
Cops got his wallet.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.296
Biz Cummins.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.798
Biz, can you hear me?

11:37.831 --> 11:39.199
What's with all
the boys in blue?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.068
Cop got shot. Might've been
this guy right here.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.103
Neck veins are flat,
no signs of tamponade.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.879
KOVAC:
I'll do the line--
seven and a half.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.413
CORDAY:
I've got two criticals
coming up.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.215
I'm going to need someone
from vascular surgery.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.150
Did you get a good look
at the guy who shot you, Sutter?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.418
There were three of them.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.486
I don't know
who pulled the trigger.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.088
How long is that going to take?

12:01.121 --> 12:02.389
No, no, that's unacceptable.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.791
Someone take this bloody phone.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.058
What about the guy next door?

12:05.092 --> 12:06.894
Hey, Doc, can you
move for a second?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.361
PRATT:
Can't you see I'm busy

12:08.395 --> 12:09.429
trying to save this guy?

12:09.462 --> 12:10.798
He might have shot this officer.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.332
He's not going anywhere. Dori?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.434
No, but his other
two buddies are
still on the loose.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.469
Blood in the pericolic
gutters and Morrison's.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.504
Let's pack him up.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.939
No DP pulse.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.307
Does your
leg tingle?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.809
Yeah, like it's asleep.

12:21.809 --> 12:22.976
Liter up.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.211
First hemacue 12.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.212
What's this?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.513
Metal fragments.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.148
He either embolized
a bullet fragment,

12:28.181 --> 12:29.917
or the hematoma's compressing
the artery.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.151
Either way, the clock's ticking.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.285
KOVAC:
Okay, line's in.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.353
Let's hook up
the blood.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.822
CARTER:
Let's run the O-neg

12:34.855 --> 12:36.423
through the central line
when I'm done.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.457
Okay, there's one OR free,

12:37.490 --> 12:38.992
and one
anesthesiologist.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.828
My police officer is
borderline hypotensive.

12:40.861 --> 12:41.895
I need to take him up.

12:41.929 --> 12:42.495
What's the output like?

12:42.529 --> 12:43.463
Pretty brisk.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.065
500cc's and counting.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.499
He could have
a massive
hemothorax.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.335
He needs surgery.
Whoa, we're not there yet.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.870
Oh, no? What are
the indications

12:49.903 --> 12:51.171
for immediate
thoracotomy
in the OR?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.339
1,200cc's immediate output.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.841
This guy's at 900,
but he's

12:53.874 --> 12:55.142
slowing down.
You're not thinking

12:55.175 --> 12:57.010
of taking up this lowlife
first, are you?

12:57.044 --> 12:58.578
CARTER:
It's all about who's
in the worst shape

12:58.611 --> 12:59.546
medically, sir.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.448
The guy in there is a cop.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.217
It's going to be 30 minutes
before another OR's ready.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.452
Well, can you
keep transfusing

13:05.485 --> 13:07.187
and just give me
five minutes?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.321
You've got three.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.290
Oh silk
and opsite.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.424
First unit in.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.426
500 hanging from
the cell saver.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.594
It's slowing down.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.462
How much?

13:15.495 --> 13:16.329
A little above 920.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.564
( alarms stop )

13:17.597 --> 13:19.032
Pressure's up
to 110 systolic.

13:19.066 --> 13:19.967
All right, good.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.134
He clotted off the bleeder.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.069
I'll tell them
to send up the cop.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.603
Hold on.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.973
950cc's, and that's it for now.
Come on, Carter.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.941
You need to keep an eye
on his pressure

13:27.975 --> 13:29.877
and an eye
on the chest tube output.

13:29.910 --> 13:30.944
BP's 118/78;
heart rate's 92.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.412
This guy's rock stable.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.247
All right, if there's
another 1,000cc's

13:34.281 --> 13:35.548
in the next two
hours, he goes up.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.117
DORI:
Pressure's dropping--
96/74.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.451
Our guy's good;
take this one up.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.020
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.

13:40.053 --> 13:44.524
You heard him. Let's roll.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.096
When's he going to be able
to answer some questions?

13:49.129 --> 13:51.064
I'll let you know.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.200
( sighs )

13:55.335 --> 13:57.437
( sighs )

13:57.470 --> 13:59.506
I keep feeling like
I'm going to puke.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.441
Is there any chance
you could be pregnant?

14:01.474 --> 14:04.377
I don't even talk to
guys unless I have to.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.645
Helen is complaining

14:05.678 --> 14:08.581
of intermittent
right-sided abdominal pain.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.317
She has no fever
and a loss of appetite.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.484
Okay.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.153
I think it's a tumor.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.088
I doubt it.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.492
Are you going
to say anything?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.261
What am I
supposed to say?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.263
It's got to be
something else.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.497
Really? What else
do you know of

14:24.531 --> 14:26.299
that luminesces
under a Wood's lamp?

14:26.333 --> 14:30.070
Oh, it's just
so wrong.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.305
Okay, take a
deep breath.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.941
Ow.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.343
Do you have any history
of gallstones?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.444
Parents? Aunts? Uncles?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.946
No.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.081
Can I die from gallstones?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.582
No.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.152
Okay, let's get LFTs

14:45.185 --> 14:48.488
and a right upper
quadrant ultrasound
for gallstones.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.260
You know, the real question is,
who does it belong to?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.427
Pratt?

14:54.461 --> 14:55.595
Oh...

14:55.628 --> 14:56.629
Frank?
Ew!

14:56.663 --> 14:57.965
Jerry?
Ooh, stop it!

14:57.998 --> 14:59.466
You're creeping
me out.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.501
This guy reeks.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.036
Oh, the copper and Clorox aroma

15:03.070 --> 15:04.571
of a vigorous
mixed bacterial infection.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.705
Smells like surgery.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.340
Come on, Jensen,
and get in there

15:07.374 --> 15:08.408
and break up those loculations.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.642
If you didn't have to dig,

15:09.676 --> 15:11.478
I would've let
those ER stooges do it.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.712
Irrigation.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.681
Oh, little bleeder
there. Bovie.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.216
Where?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.584
Just at the inferior
edge of the piriformis.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.519
Uh, up on the bovie.
More suction.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.453
No, no, no, no!

15:20.487 --> 15:21.654
Not up on the bovie.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.190
Vascular clamp and 3-0 silk.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.457
Pressure: 110/70.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.393
Alcock's canal?
Inferior gluteal artery?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.727
Ever heard of those?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.729
I'm having a hard
time locating...

15:29.762 --> 15:32.199
Stick-tie that thing
before the guy bleeds to death.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.566
All right, give me that.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.635
( alarm sounding )
Turn that thing off.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.504
Hold that up.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.174
All right, now more

15:41.208 --> 15:42.209
that... back this way.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.011
More. Ow, ow!

15:44.044 --> 15:45.145
Stop.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.679
Do you want me
to get Corday?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.015
No.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.416
Dr. Romano...
No!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.018
( alarm continues )
Did you page vascular?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.652
Twice. Dr. Dorset
said he's on his way.

15:52.685 --> 15:53.653
Who?

15:53.686 --> 15:54.654
The new guy.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.289
Laps. Pack around the mesentery.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.624
( alarm continues )

15:57.657 --> 16:00.227
Oh, damn.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.428
Tachy at 110.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.629
Another vascular clamp.

16:02.662 --> 16:06.066
SMA repair looks good.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.568
It's nice of you
to finally join us, Dr. Dorset.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.671
This gentleman has a bullet
fragment in the femoral artery.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.606
He's going to need a graft
or a bypass.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.741
You're in for a long night.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.509
Really?

16:16.543 --> 16:18.678
Well, they call
me "Fast Eddie"
for a reason--

16:18.711 --> 16:20.747
several in fact.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.651
Ten blade, please.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.619
Stand by with
a number four
French catheter

16:26.653 --> 16:28.688
bulbs, and have
a 3cc heparinized
saline ready.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.058
You're going
to do a Fogarty embolectomy?

16:31.058 --> 16:31.791
Clamp.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.660
Well, I prefer to call it

16:33.693 --> 16:36.063
the "Dorset Bulletectomy."

16:37.597 --> 16:39.766
Heparin flush.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.169
There's no back flow.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.303
It's totally occluded.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.571
Yup. Fogarty.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.173
Okay, give me a hand here.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.707
Excuse me?
Remove the wire.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.776
Oh.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.413
Got it.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.116
( humming )

17:00.153 --> 17:03.256
Hey, somebody's glad to see me.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.193
Clamp off.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.660
Feeding

17:07.694 --> 17:10.730
the catheter.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.332
Pressure and
pulse are steady.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.500
Give me your hand.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.135
Excuse me?
Your hand.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.671
Now...

17:18.704 --> 17:20.307
he's got healthy
interior walls.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.641
I mean, any
resistance you feel

17:21.674 --> 17:23.810
against that balloon
is the wall itself.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.213
Do you feel that right...

17:26.246 --> 17:28.115
right... there?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.683
Yeah.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.252
Okay, remember it.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.453
Any harder,
and you can rupture the wall.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.554
It'll feel hard,

17:34.587 --> 17:35.588
and then suddenly,
the balloon

17:35.622 --> 17:36.823
will inflate
too easily

17:36.856 --> 17:38.291
meaning you blew
through the wall.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.194
Right.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.695
Okay.
Bowel fine.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.597
He's a lucky man.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.199
Nothing in my hand

17:46.233 --> 17:49.769
nothing up my sleeve, and...

17:49.802 --> 17:51.738
( metallic clink )

17:51.771 --> 17:53.640
TRAN:
Good popliteal pulse.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.410
His leg's pinking up.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.511
Thank you. Thank
you very much.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.879
I'll be here
all week,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.349
and don't forget
to tip your waitress.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.592
GALLANT:
You look good.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.860
HARKINS:
I feel better.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.728
Okay, it's official.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.197
Thanks.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.631
Hey, Gallant,
could you help Dr. Chen

18:18.665 --> 18:20.467
with the thoracentesis
on Mr. Atkins?

18:20.500 --> 18:21.701
Okay.
Good luck.

18:21.734 --> 18:22.669
Thanks.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.803
Thoracentesis, huh?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.238
Shaw's, 8:00?

18:25.272 --> 18:26.373
I'll be there.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.640
All right.
Thanks.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.609
Hey.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.678
Hey.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.613
Feeling better?

18:33.646 --> 18:36.649
Compared to the last time
you saw me, yeah.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.551
Yeah, I was
going to...

18:38.585 --> 18:39.819
Actually,
I need your signature.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.588
Um, resident review.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.690
Yeah, sure.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.460
So, what's next?

18:47.494 --> 18:50.730
I mean, your
next rotation?

18:50.763 --> 18:52.699
Um, pediatrics.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.468
Okay, thanks.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.703
Hey, Erin...

18:56.736 --> 18:58.438
You know what?
I really have to get going.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.806
I-I know.
I just...

18:59.839 --> 19:01.474
I never got a chance
to talk to you.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.276
I was in the hospital
for three weeks.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.378
I'm sorry.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.515
I was having
a bad time.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.584
I never meant
to hurt you.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.786
Then you should
have slowed down.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.360
Leon, pick up the phone.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.694
I need to talk to you.
It's me.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.230
Don't worry...

19:23.230 --> 19:25.398
I'll call you back.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.534
What's the word
on Officer Sutter?

19:27.567 --> 19:29.236
Last I heard,
he was still in surgery.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.970
The guy you brought in--
did he have a gun on him?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.705
I don't know.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.574
So, what? You
just found this
guy in the street?

19:34.607 --> 19:35.808
Yeah.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.244
Did you see anybody else
with him?

19:37.277 --> 19:38.678
No.
Did you hear
gunshots?

19:38.711 --> 19:40.313
No.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.449
Hey, Pratt, your boy's
losing his pressure, man.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.483
What's in the thoraseal?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.318
950cc's,
just like it was.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.586
Well, he's got
to be bleeding
from somewhere.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.954
Maybe it's
the belly.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.556
I can't get pressure
with the dynamap.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.657
I'll go get Carter.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.792
Get two more units
on the infuser.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.268
So, when are
you leaving me?

20:01.301 --> 20:02.802
What?

20:02.835 --> 20:06.606
When are you planning
on running off to the jungle?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.441
Oh. Well...

20:08.475 --> 20:09.842
I haven't
really decided

20:09.876 --> 20:11.744
if that's something
I'm going to do yet.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.680
Really? Luka made it
sound like you had.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.515
Luka's a big advocate
of the program.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.850
You thought it was cool
when he went.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.652
Yeah, Luka went home
to his own country,

20:19.686 --> 20:20.987
and he didn't
have a girlfriend

20:21.020 --> 20:21.954
asking him not to go.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.623
You could come with me.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.425
Like I don't have enough drama
in my life already.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.959
Well, well, well.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.995
If it ain't the Ken and Barbie
of the medical world.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.863
You look better.

20:30.897 --> 20:31.964
I am better.

20:31.998 --> 20:32.999
Hello, beautiful.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.701
Hello.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.736
His blood sugar level was
over 600, but his serum ketones

20:36.769 --> 20:37.804
levels were negative.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.539
Well, I could have
told you that.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.575
Type II diabetics
don't get ketoacidosis.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.043
Oh, it was a hypersmolar coma.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.313
You needed insulin
and IV fluids,

20:46.346 --> 20:47.914
both of which
could have been avoided

20:47.947 --> 20:50.383
if you had taken
your medication as directed.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.051
I gave it to a
patient of mine.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.820
He couldn't
afford his own.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.688
Carter... Pratt needs you.

20:55.722 --> 20:56.723
You should have paged me.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.557
Get ultrasound
in here.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.825
When did he crash?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.460
Just now.
Nothing out
the chest.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.628
I'm guessing
the bullet
tracked down

21:01.661 --> 21:02.829
to the belly.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.364
From the third
intercostal space?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.732
Milk it.
What?

21:05.765 --> 21:06.833
Pressure's only 50 palp.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.468
Clots.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.837
When there's no drainage,
you milk the chest tube.

21:10.870 --> 21:11.838
( alarm sounds )

21:11.871 --> 21:12.872
Okay, he's in V-tach.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.040
Starting
compressions.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.542
Charge to 200.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.610
PRATT:
At least another liter
in there.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.045
And clear.

21:20.012 --> 21:20.747
V fib.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.981
Thoracotomy tray.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.383
Let's go. Splash the chest.
Pratt!

21:23.416 --> 21:25.552
Get the rib
spreader ready.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.886
All right, come on, Pratt!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.755
What the hell are
you doing here, Leon?

21:28.788 --> 21:29.956
I wanted to see you.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.758
What are you doing to him?

21:31.791 --> 21:32.959
CARTER:
He got shot.
Statinsky.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.861
Get those internal
paddles ready.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.363
Leon, you shouldn't be here.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.530
Get him out of here.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.831
I really need
to talk to you, G.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.066
Could you put him
in the suture room?

21:40.099 --> 21:41.368
What for?

21:41.401 --> 21:42.502
He's here for a wound check,

21:42.535 --> 21:43.836
and make sure
you put him in a gown.

21:43.870 --> 21:44.937
Is-Is he going to die, G?

21:44.971 --> 21:45.972
Just shut the hell up,

21:46.005 --> 21:47.073
and get out of here! Go!

21:47.106 --> 21:48.375
Okay, we are clamped.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.509
Start pumping.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.677
He needs more blood.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.744
How many units?

21:51.778 --> 21:54.013
Four units.
His heart is empty.

21:59.819 --> 22:00.887
Charge to 30. Clear.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.389
MALIK:
Still in V fib.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.523
Another amp of epi.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.524
30 again.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.825
How long has he been down?

22:05.858 --> 22:06.859
35 minutes.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.127
Clear.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.898
MALIK:
Asystole.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.633
You ready
to call this?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.067
CARTER:
We could
try more epi.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.003
I don't think so.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.538
He's young.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.708
He's been
down too long.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.711
Call it.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.880
Time of death: 14:45.
( removing gloves )

22:27.914 --> 22:29.015
Is his family here?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.082
I don't know.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.786
LEON:
Everything worked out?

22:33.820 --> 22:35.422
PRATT:
He didn't make it, man.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.056
He died.
Oh, no!

22:37.089 --> 22:38.691
He's dead.
( blubbering )

22:38.725 --> 22:42.595
( Leon sobbing and blubbering )

22:42.629 --> 22:44.096
ROMANO:
You move any slower, Jensen,

22:44.130 --> 22:46.666
this guy's going to heal
before we can sew him up.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.935
Giving one of your
inspirational speeches, Robert?

22:48.968 --> 22:50.470
Elizabeth.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.572
I thought you were doing
an arterial caval shunt.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.640
Another lap to me.

22:53.673 --> 22:54.907
I take it he died.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.543
On the contrary--
I'm finished.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.944
The patient's in recovery.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.513
I heard you were having
some difficulty, though.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.014
You were misinformed.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.816
Apparently.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.686
I didn't realize you were
back on surgical rotation.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.521
Just assisting Jensen.

23:08.555 --> 23:09.756
Ah.

23:09.789 --> 23:10.957
So, uh,

23:10.990 --> 23:12.925
how are we
doing, Jensen?

23:12.959 --> 23:14.026
Fine, thank you.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.128
Good hemostasis, no leak.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.964
The posterior femoral
cutaneous nerve

23:17.997 --> 23:19.599
runs right next
to the artery.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.000
It's easy to cut both.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.970
And the head bone's connected
to the what again?

23:25.137 --> 23:27.106
Would you like me to scrub in?

23:27.139 --> 23:27.974
To check?

23:28.007 --> 23:30.176
No.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.778
It would be such a shame

23:31.811 --> 23:33.079
for this young man to
come in for an abscess

23:33.112 --> 23:34.514
and go home with a drop foot

23:34.547 --> 23:35.948
because of a severed
sciatic nerve.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.684
You're right, you know,
and look.

23:37.717 --> 23:38.951
I just figured out a way

23:38.985 --> 23:45.858
you can help me--
leave.

23:48.728 --> 23:49.962
Labs are back.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.064
This is Sydney's
friend, Fiona.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.500
What did she take?

23:53.500 --> 23:54.834
She didn't.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.236
Tox screen is
negative for
everything.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.006
Did you find any
pill fragments?
No.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.574
ABBY:
Looks like, uh,

24:01.608 --> 24:03.109
nuts.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.044
And cherries, maybe.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.947
I smell chocolate.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.516
Her boyfriend cheated on her,

24:09.516 --> 24:11.518
and she went on
a banana split spree.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.620
So you called 9-1-1?

24:13.653 --> 24:15.021
I didn't. She did.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.889
She wanted to get
her stomach pumped.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.025
She must have ate
like 50,000 calories.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.860
Sometimes she binges and purges.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.595
Sometimes?
She's lost her gag reflex

24:22.629 --> 24:25.131
from sticking her finger
down her throat so many times.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.733
LEWIS:
Luka, obviously,

24:26.766 --> 24:28.134
she has an
eating disorder.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.002
No, I'll tell you what
an eating disorder is.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.071
It's when a mother hasn't eaten
in six days because

24:32.104 --> 24:34.841
she's giving what little food
she has to her three children.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.175
She just cost
the hospital $3,000

24:36.208 --> 24:37.644
and for what?

24:37.677 --> 24:40.179
So she doesn't put on a pound?

24:40.212 --> 24:41.781
LEWIS:
Luka...

24:41.814 --> 24:43.850
It's cheaper than liposuction.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.019
CARTER:
Did you know him?

24:47.053 --> 24:48.855
Was he a friend
of yours?

24:48.888 --> 24:51.057
What are you doing in here?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.825
Came to check on Leon.

24:52.859 --> 24:53.993
Couldn't find his chart.

24:54.026 --> 24:54.961
I'm working on it.

24:54.994 --> 24:55.995
Need any help?

24:56.028 --> 24:56.829
No.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.097
I don't mind.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.032
He seems kind of
shaken up about Biz.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.635
That was your
friend's name,
right? Biz?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.103
Could you excuse us, please?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.638
This is between me
and my patient.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.073
Yeah.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.208
Why don't you come find
me when you are done.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.280
( door opening, closing )

25:14.313 --> 25:16.983
Did you tell him
you know Biz?

25:17.016 --> 25:17.984
No.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.118
I don't know. Maybe.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.252
If I did, it
was an accident.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.954
An accident?

25:21.988 --> 25:24.591
It's always an accident
with you, isn't it, Leon?

25:24.591 --> 25:26.025
I'm telling you the truth, G.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.695
You told me it was
a security guard that shot him.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.930
It wasn't a security guard.
It was a cop.

25:30.963 --> 25:31.864
I didn't get a good look.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.199
It happened really fast.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.101
Did you have a gun?
It was Biz's idea.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.869
Did you shoot at the police?

25:36.903 --> 25:37.837
I don't know.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.171
I don't... maybe.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.107
I don't remember, G.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.342
Everybody just
started shooting.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.277
( sobbing ):
I-I'm sorry, G.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.179
Please, I don't want to go
to jail.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.315
Don't let them
put me in jail, G!

25:49.348 --> 25:50.750
I-I'm sorry, G.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.085
I don't want
to go to jail.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.154
I'm going to go out
on a limb here

25:55.187 --> 25:57.624
and guess that you're
having a bad day.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.258
I'm tired
of treating patients

25:59.291 --> 26:01.694
who think ice cream
is an emergency.

26:01.728 --> 26:05.097
I'm just tired of it.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.233
I think maybe you
should talk to him.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.068
He seems a
little depressed.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.037
He's European.
That's his baseline.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.805
And besides,
I'm still mad at him

26:12.839 --> 26:15.708
for putting that adventure
doctor idea into Carter's head.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.044
CORDAY:
Mr. Hennessey
in Exam One can go home.

26:18.077 --> 26:18.978
Oh, thanks.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.146
How's the cop?

26:20.179 --> 26:22.682
Good. He's going
to be fine.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.217
So, this is where
you hide out.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.019
Hi, Dr. Corday,
right?

26:27.053 --> 26:27.754
Dr. Dorset?

26:27.787 --> 26:28.655
Yes.

26:28.655 --> 26:29.856
Is there something wrong

26:29.889 --> 26:31.190
with Mr. Sutter?
No one paged me...

26:31.223 --> 26:32.859
No, no, no.
H-He's, he's fine.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.193
I was just wondering if, um,

26:34.226 --> 26:36.295
you wanted to grab some coffee
or something?

26:37.196 --> 26:40.166
CORDAY:
Um...

26:40.199 --> 26:42.034
I appreciate the offer,

26:42.068 --> 26:43.335
but to be honest,

26:43.369 --> 26:44.804
I'm swamped...

26:44.837 --> 26:47.173
at the moment, so...
Right.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.709
Uh, perhaps
some other time.

26:49.742 --> 26:50.910
I'm going to hold you to that.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.917
I like coffee.
( Abby chuckling )

26:57.950 --> 26:59.886
He's cute.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.353
Was I rude?

27:01.387 --> 27:03.089
No.
No.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.356
( sighs )

27:04.390 --> 27:07.259
Look, the problem is
that, um, you know,

27:07.293 --> 27:09.295
I go home half
expecting Mark

27:09.328 --> 27:13.232
to be playing with
Ella in the backyard.

27:13.265 --> 27:17.236
It's been... a long time
since I...

27:17.269 --> 27:20.139
you know, talked to another man.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.778
I think I overreacted.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.179
It was only coffee.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.915
I think Mark would

27:28.948 --> 27:32.318
want you to get on
with your life.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.320
I also think if a
good-looking guy

27:34.353 --> 27:35.988
is interested in you,

27:36.022 --> 27:37.356
and you're not interested
in him,

27:37.389 --> 27:40.092
the least you can do
is introduce me.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.029
Hmm.

27:44.196 --> 27:47.834
Thank you.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.403
I'm not kidding.
( both chuckling )

27:53.172 --> 27:54.974
Mrs. Hughes?

27:55.007 --> 27:57.109
Where you going?

27:57.143 --> 28:00.046
Huh? Let's get you
back this way, okay?

28:00.079 --> 28:02.749
Now, there's
supposed to be...

28:02.749 --> 28:04.984
BRIGHT:
Looks like you've got
your hands full.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.152
Hi.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.153
Hello.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.155
John Bright.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.222
Uh, she has Alzheimer's.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.958
Oh, poor thing.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.861
Mrs. Hughes, let's get you
back in your bed, okay?

28:14.894 --> 28:16.829
Your daughter will be
here in just a minute.

28:16.863 --> 28:17.930
Could you please...?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.365
( sighs )

28:19.398 --> 28:23.135
Uh, I guess I owe you
a very big thank you.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.137
You provide
an invaluable service.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.438
It's the least I could do.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.307
I just hope that we
earned the allocation

28:28.340 --> 28:30.442
based on our merit as
a health care provider

28:30.476 --> 28:32.278
for the community.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.413
Had I not been brought here,
Dr. Weaver,

28:34.446 --> 28:36.315
I probably
would not have pushed

28:36.348 --> 28:38.951
for County to get
the additional funding.

28:38.985 --> 28:41.287
Did you give me
special treatment?

28:41.320 --> 28:42.288
Well, I...

28:42.321 --> 28:43.990
Of course you did.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.892
From what I've seen,
you give everyone

28:45.925 --> 28:48.194
who comes through these doors
special treatment.

28:48.227 --> 28:52.298
And that kind of dedication
deserves to be rewarded.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.900
Oh...

28:53.933 --> 28:55.301
Oh, uh, sorry.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.803
Got to go.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.339
Somebody dropped this off
for you.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.274
Made me promise to give it
to you personally.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.476
I'm thinking
nude blackmail photos?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.345
Not again.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.214
Is this because of McNulty?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.348
What?

29:09.381 --> 29:11.283
You leaving,
going to a foreign land

29:11.317 --> 29:12.985
to bring medicine
to the natives?

29:13.019 --> 29:14.353
No, I-I mean it.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.822
'Cause he lives in the back
of a free clinic,

29:15.855 --> 29:17.556
you don't do enough?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.926
I don't know. Maybe that's
got something to do with it.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.028
I don't know why you didn't
talk to me about this.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.095
I'm not going
anywhere right now.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.463
You talked
to Luka about it.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.265
And even if I was,
it's for two weeks.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.234
Yeah, and some of these places
are really dangerous.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.435
I thought you
forgot about me.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.970
You need to go back
on insulin.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.471
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

29:32.504 --> 29:33.906
30 NPH in the morning,

29:33.940 --> 29:35.842
15 in the evening,
same as before.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.409
I need you need to check
your sugars four times a day.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.445
( laughing )

29:39.478 --> 29:42.581
I'd be lucky to find
four times during
the week to do that.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.450
Maybe you can hire
an assistant.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.319
Or find the time
to remind yourself.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.188
What's this?

29:49.221 --> 29:50.189
A check.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.124
I can see that.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.092
But I can't take it.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.593
Why not?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.296
Well, for one thing,
it's got too many zeroes.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.031
Get some new equipment.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.199
Hire a nurse.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.101
Hire a physician's assistant.

30:02.134 --> 30:06.072
I'm not going to have to name
the place after you, am I?

30:06.105 --> 30:07.373
No.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.308
Although "The Carter
Family Clinic"

30:09.341 --> 30:11.277
does have kind of
a nice ring to it.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.279
Thank you, John.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.113
You're welcome.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.281
How'd you like

30:15.314 --> 30:16.348
to come work for me,
beautiful?

30:16.382 --> 30:18.017
Do you have a dental plan?

30:18.050 --> 30:20.086
WEAVER:
No, I'm not giving you
any time off.

30:20.119 --> 30:20.853
I have sick days.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.154
Are you kidding?

30:22.188 --> 30:24.056
You're lucky you
still have a job.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.925
I need time
to sort things out.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.226
Yeah, I agree.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.328
And you need to do it
on your own time.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.296
Wait...

30:30.329 --> 30:32.064
Hey,
where are you going?

30:32.098 --> 30:34.433
Dr. Kovac, can I
get a little help?
No.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.435
Steven Rafferty,
65 with chest pain,

30:36.468 --> 30:38.337
partially relieved
by nitro.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.206
Get a 12 lead and titrate
ten of morphine, go.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.974
Sir, can you tell me
on a scale of one to ten

30:42.008 --> 30:44.176
what your
pain level is?

30:48.414 --> 30:50.316
Luka!

30:51.951 --> 30:54.620
He seems pissed.

30:56.422 --> 30:57.456
Been out here
almost two hours.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.657
I figured you couldn't

30:58.690 --> 31:00.426
go that long
without a cigarette.

31:03.595 --> 31:06.432
What are you doing here?

31:10.169 --> 31:11.503
Thank you.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.272
Sure you don't want
something to eat?

31:13.305 --> 31:15.174
I'm fine, thanks.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.944
Good, I need the gas money.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.415
How's Carter?

31:23.449 --> 31:25.051
He's good.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.552
I like him.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.020
Me, too.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.498
It was the disease.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.702
I was scared.

31:43.735 --> 31:48.240
I was afraid that I was
going to end up like Mom.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.709
I didn't want you
to see me like that.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.478
Like Maggie.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.382
I never meant to hurt you.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.051
If it wasn't for you,
I don't know where I'd be.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.587
It wasn't your fault.
You couldn't help it.

32:01.620 --> 32:05.224
It's just....

32:05.257 --> 32:08.127
You protected me for so long,

32:08.160 --> 32:11.998
I felt like
I'd let you down.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.466
That's not true.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.735
That could never be true.

32:16.768 --> 32:21.240
I just wish, sometimes,
I was eight years old again,

32:21.273 --> 32:25.611
'cause even when
things got bad,

32:25.644 --> 32:27.679
and they got bad,

32:27.713 --> 32:30.549
I knew you'd always be there.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.354
And I always will be.

32:35.387 --> 32:39.391
Yeah, but no one's
ever there for you.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.494
And, uh,
I turned my back on you,

32:42.528 --> 32:46.498
after everything
that you did for me,

32:46.532 --> 32:50.469
and for Mom.

32:50.502 --> 32:54.073
And that was a really
crappy thing to do.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.175
And I'm sorry.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.543
You don't have to apologize.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.477
I do.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.546
I want to.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.518
I love you, Abby.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.095
You deserve a better family.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.130
( chuckling )

33:21.233 --> 33:25.204
And I just wanted you
to know that...

33:25.237 --> 33:27.173
I'm okay.

33:27.206 --> 33:31.077
Unfortunately,

33:31.077 --> 33:36.548
I had to get, um, bad
before I got better.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.556
It's not over, you know.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.396
Yeah, I know.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.600
Want to see a picture
of my new girlfriend?

33:56.602 --> 33:59.105
Sure.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.573
What do you think?

34:04.676 --> 34:06.578
It's a plane.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.214
Yeah, I bought it.

34:08.246 --> 34:11.516
Sold, uh, my car, my bike,
just about everything.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.818
Um, I'm going to run

34:12.851 --> 34:15.587
hunting and fishing
charters in Wisconsin.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.623
You're going to be a bush pilot.

34:17.656 --> 34:18.757
( chuckling )

34:18.790 --> 34:19.824
Pretty cool, huh?

34:21.427 --> 34:23.129
It's probably
just a mild virus

34:23.129 --> 34:24.596
that will go away
on its own.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.799
I'm going to send off,
uh, some more bloodwork,

34:27.833 --> 34:30.601
so you'll need to follow up
with your family doctor, okay?

34:30.636 --> 34:32.670
Hey, Susan.
You up for dinner?

34:32.704 --> 34:34.572
No, I'm going home

34:34.606 --> 34:36.475
and I'm going to take
a three-hour bath.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.543
Oh, come on, you can
do that after dinner.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.212
I know this
great new Thai place.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.380
Hmm... oh, Jing-Mei,
thank you.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.649
Oh, sure.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.350
( sighing )

34:44.382 --> 34:45.617
So?

34:45.650 --> 34:50.422
Um, I was using
the Wood's lamp today,

34:50.456 --> 34:52.224
uh, when I was
wearing your sweater,

34:52.257 --> 34:55.726
and some stuff
showed up on it.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.529
Like what?

34:57.563 --> 35:00.166
Well, there were just some
stains on your sweater.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.467
I mean, it's none
of my business,

35:01.500 --> 35:02.601
I thought you might

35:02.634 --> 35:03.669
just want to get it
dry cleaned.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.237
It was club soda.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.172
What?

35:06.172 --> 35:07.706
Yeah, Susan.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.442
I opened up a can this morning
and it sprayed all over me.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.312
That's why I had to take off
the sweater, to let it dry.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.713
Oh.

35:14.746 --> 35:15.714
Oh.

35:15.747 --> 35:16.615
Club soda.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.250
Yeah.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.919
Soda water glows under
black lights, remember?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.721
Good.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.690
I just thought...
I don't know.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.325
What, what's
your thought?

35:26.358 --> 35:27.693
That, um,
I'm this ER slut

35:27.726 --> 35:29.761
with spunk all
over her sweater?

35:29.795 --> 35:32.198
No, no, Jing-Mei...

35:35.334 --> 35:36.668
( sighing )

35:49.415 --> 35:51.750
Somebody
claim that body?

35:51.783 --> 35:53.685
No.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.289
I heard the cop's
going to be okay.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.357
Good.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.491
Pratt.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.227
What do you want from me?

36:01.227 --> 36:02.794
I just want to help you.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.264
Or, at least, prevent you

36:05.297 --> 36:07.266
from getting yourself
into trouble.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.467
I'm not in trouble.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.869
What about Leon?

36:13.505 --> 36:14.806
I don't know.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.709
He seemed
pretty scared today.

36:17.743 --> 36:18.977
Yeah.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.380
He's a scared little kid.

36:21.413 --> 36:24.450
Except he's not
a little kid.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.852
He's 27, and he was
probably involved

36:26.885 --> 36:29.521
in a robbery
that left a cop shot

36:29.555 --> 36:32.291
and somebody else dead.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.925
I think the cops

36:33.959 --> 36:36.762
are probably going
to blame this on Biz.

36:36.795 --> 36:40.999
If Leon went away
for a while,

36:41.032 --> 36:44.670
I doubt anybody
would go looking for him.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.644
You know what?

36:52.678 --> 36:54.646
I try to keep him
out of trouble,

36:54.680 --> 36:58.617
but he wants to have his own
friends, he wants to be cool.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.953
And they talk him
into doing stuff.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.790
I can't watch him
every minute of the day.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.759
I can't.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.629
You ought to learn
to let go.

37:10.662 --> 37:14.800
Stop blaming yourself.

37:14.833 --> 37:19.505
Tell Leon
I said good-bye.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.319
Gallant.

37:33.319 --> 37:36.655
I need you to do me a favor.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.795
What do you say we go
out to dinner tonight?

37:43.829 --> 37:45.331
Someplace nice?

37:45.364 --> 37:46.665
At least for me.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.066
I can't.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.702
Eric's picking me up.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.571
Eric, your brother?

37:52.604 --> 37:53.672
Mm-hmm.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.474
He's here.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.842
And he's on his meds.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.444
He's picking you up
to do what?

37:58.477 --> 38:00.512
Um, he's taking me
to see his airplane.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.780
He bought an airplane.

38:01.813 --> 38:02.914
Yes.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.416
Want me to go with you?

38:04.450 --> 38:05.517
No.

38:05.551 --> 38:06.885
I think it will be okay.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.754
He seems really,
really good.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.422
Are you going to go
flying with him?

38:10.456 --> 38:11.490
No.

38:11.523 --> 38:12.758
I'm supportive,
not stupid.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.426
I have to go by
McNulty's clinic anyway.

38:14.460 --> 38:15.594
He forgot his prescriptions.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.828
So I'll just call you
after that?

38:16.862 --> 38:17.863
Okay.

38:17.896 --> 38:18.897
Good luck.
Thanks.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.899
Don't go flying
with him.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.369
Don't go to Chechnya.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.374
What are you doing?

38:28.407 --> 38:30.909
Your resident asked
for a curbside.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.678
And?

38:35.614 --> 38:37.383
There's an area
of sensory loss

38:37.383 --> 38:39.585
on the posterior aspect
of the thigh.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.854
Jensen bagged the posterior
femoral cutaneous.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.923
But there's
no foot drop.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.859
The sciatic, tibial, and
peroneal are completely intact,

38:47.893 --> 38:50.862
although he'll probably be left
with some numbness in his thigh.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.399
I guess he got lucky then.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.701
Yes, he did.

39:00.739 --> 39:01.907
Where's Jensen?

39:01.940 --> 39:03.809
He said he was going up
to the roof.

39:03.842 --> 39:04.943
To get a patient?

39:04.976 --> 39:06.645
To jump.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.585
Here you go.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.721
Got some, uh, snacks
for you for the trip.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.590
How far
is Baltimore?

39:18.624 --> 39:20.125
Ah, you should get there
tomorrow night.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.427
Really?

39:21.427 --> 39:21.960
Yeah.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.895
That's cool.

39:23.929 --> 39:27.766
So, uh, you've got the phone
number for Greg's Aunt Rose?

39:27.799 --> 39:29.501
Yup.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.169
Let's go ahead and get you
on the bus then, now.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.904
What about Greg?

39:32.938 --> 39:35.106
Well, uh, he's going
to call you in a few days.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.842
He's not coming?

39:36.875 --> 39:38.577
No, Leon, listen to me.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.612
You're supposed to go visit

39:40.646 --> 39:42.180
his Aunt Rose
for a while, okay?

39:42.213 --> 39:44.916
Yeah, right, but is he going
to at least say good-bye?

39:44.950 --> 39:48.787
Look, uh, he's working

39:48.820 --> 39:50.055
at the hospital.

39:50.088 --> 39:53.459
( sobbing ):
He's mad at me.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.793
No, no, Leon look.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.194
He's just, he's just
really busy, man.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.596
He's just really busy.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.831
He sent me away
because I messed up.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.099
No...
I'm so stupid!

40:01.132 --> 40:03.469
Leon, Leon, that
is not true, okay?

40:03.502 --> 40:04.903
I need to talk to him.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.138
Okay, look, Leon,
you got to get on that bus.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.206
I don't want to do this.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.207
Leon, listen to me.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.842
You have to get on that bus.

40:12.478 --> 40:13.912
All right,
come on then.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.013
Come on.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.186
Come on.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.892
You have a good trip, okay?

40:30.195 --> 40:31.597
Be safe.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.945
Don't do it, Jensen!

40:46.978 --> 40:50.482
My car's down there.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.818
Your patient's
going to be fine.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.820
The leg should be
fully functional.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.988
There was nerve damage.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.957
Yeah, but it was minimal.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.828
Hey, you'll do better next time.

41:04.262 --> 41:05.864
You're right.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.233
Because I won't go
into surgery with you.

41:11.036 --> 41:14.940
( helicopter whirring overhead )

41:54.946 --> 41:56.582
( knocking )

41:59.117 --> 42:01.119
Hey, Dr. McNulty!

42:01.152 --> 42:03.722
You in there?

42:05.757 --> 42:06.825
Hey...

42:12.063 --> 42:13.098
( knocking )

42:13.131 --> 42:14.700
Dr. McNulty?

42:16.668 --> 42:18.670
Mac, you in there?
It's John.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.239
Is there a problem here, sir?

42:21.272 --> 42:23.074
No, no, I'm an ER doctor
from County.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.810
One of my patients lives here.

42:24.843 --> 42:25.977
I, I think he might be

42:26.011 --> 42:27.012
in a little bit
of trouble, actually.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.179
Well, did you try calling him?

42:28.213 --> 42:29.247
Yeah, and nobody's answering.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.616
He's kind of a stubborn old guy

42:30.649 --> 42:32.217
and I treated him
today with insulin,

42:32.250 --> 42:34.753
and I'm worried that
if he didn't eat any dinner

42:34.786 --> 42:36.888
he might be in a coma
from low blood sugar.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.289
Okay, you want me
to call an ambulance?

42:38.323 --> 42:39.625
I just need to get inside.

42:39.625 --> 42:40.692
( banging )

42:40.726 --> 42:42.127
CARTER:
Hey, Mac.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.304
Doesn't look like
he's here, sir.

42:53.338 --> 42:54.673
This is his clinic.

42:54.706 --> 42:57.375
This has been his clinic
for 20 years.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.910
He lives back there.

42:58.944 --> 43:01.913
I been working this
beat since '95, sir.

43:01.947 --> 43:03.248
That clinic was only
here a few weeks.

43:03.281 --> 43:07.018
It used to be, uh,
a Christian bookstore

43:07.052 --> 43:09.254
and a tanning parlor
before that, so...

43:09.287 --> 43:11.256
I was here three days ago.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.825
Well, these clinics,
they come and go.

43:13.859 --> 43:16.094
Some are legit,
but lots aren't.
