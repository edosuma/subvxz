9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

00:03.404 --> 00:05.806
-Help me get her some air.
-Why don't I just punch it
in its face?

00:05.839 --> 00:07.475
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.310
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:09.343 --> 00:12.346
Empire, Lethal Weapon,
and The X-Files.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.482
We need your help,
even if we don't trust you.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:23.023 --> 00:27.728
HEN: 4.5 billion years ago,
an astral body the size of Mars

00:27.761 --> 00:29.663
slammed into the Earth.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.232
The debris that flew
from our planet

00:31.265 --> 00:33.834
became stuck in Earth's gravity

00:33.867 --> 00:37.171
and formed our moon.
That's right.

00:37.205 --> 00:40.908
The moon is just a part of
the Earth, separated forever,

00:40.941 --> 00:45.146
always drawn back towards us,
longing to reconnect.

00:47.115 --> 00:50.918
It is said to increase
fertility, create chaos

00:50.951 --> 00:55.856
and cause people to do things
they would never normally do.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.293
No one knows why things get
so weird when the moon is full,

00:59.327 --> 01:02.696
why it makes people
act so crazy.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.432
All I know is that on this job,

01:04.465 --> 01:06.734
the one night you need
to be ready for anything

01:06.767 --> 01:10.070
is a night when the moon
is full.

01:10.104 --> 01:13.040
You, uh, want to watch
a Ray Donovan?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.976
I wish, but...

01:16.009 --> 01:18.246
...I have to get
my sleep tonight.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.249
It's gonna be a full moon
tomorrow and it's always crazy.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.752
I need to make sure
that I am rested.

01:29.290 --> 01:34.228
Well, maybe we could have
some close time.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.597
It'll help you sleep.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.766
It'll take
a whole lot longer

01:38.799 --> 01:42.069
than an episode of Ray Donovan
to finish.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.072
-Not for me.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.275
I don't mind
doing the extra work

01:47.308 --> 01:49.610
to get you
across the finish line.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.012
Shade, shade, shade,
shade, shade.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.452
-I love you, baby.
-Mm-hmm.

01:58.486 --> 02:02.490
You are the most beautiful,
sexy, powerful woman

02:02.523 --> 02:03.991
I've ever seen,

02:04.024 --> 02:06.927
but tonight I got
to get my sleep, babe.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.936
-LBD.
-Karen, don't say that.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.037
I'm just tired.

02:17.070 --> 02:21.175
Lesbian Bed Death.

02:21.209 --> 02:24.512
Doesn't matter how hot
a couple is for each other.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.480
Eventually,
we all succumb to it.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.550
Come on. I get what I need.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.019
Like, don't you feel the magic
when we're cuddling?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.190
I've just been in relationships

02:36.224 --> 02:40.728
that have been more like
sisterhoods before.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.497
If we're not having sex,

02:43.531 --> 02:46.234
then what exactly is it
that makes us a couple?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.302
Okay.

02:48.336 --> 02:51.539
-Just let me get my rest
tonight... -Uh-huh.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.742
...and when I come home
after work tomorrow,

02:54.775 --> 02:56.344
we'll crawl into bed.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.812
It'll still be a full moon.

02:58.846 --> 03:03.016
And who knows what kind of
crazy stuff might happen?

03:03.050 --> 03:04.952
Oh.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.093
Tomorrow. Okay.

03:17.130 --> 03:21.935
* I see the bad moon a-rising

03:21.969 --> 03:25.606
* I see trouble on the way...

03:25.639 --> 03:27.241
All right, folks,
coming through.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.376
Excuse me, please.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.544
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.346
What you doing there?

03:32.380 --> 03:34.382
I'm gonna have to take you out
if that's okay with you.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.518
All right. You'll be fine.

03:39.287 --> 03:43.190
* Well, it's bound
to take your life *

03:43.223 --> 03:46.193
* There's a bad moon
on the rise... *

03:46.226 --> 03:48.596
Hi. Are you ready?

03:48.629 --> 03:50.731
Yeah? Watch your head.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.433
Oh, I got you.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.435
-I got you.
-Thank you.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.404
I can't believe they didn't
have a key for this.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.205
Don't worry. It's, uh,
it's one of those nights.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.376
And here. Congratulations
on your moo-moo.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.477
Here we go.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.787
911, what's your emergency?

04:16.189 --> 04:18.225
You're such a dork.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.793
You're a cute dork,
but you're a dork.

04:19.827 --> 04:20.828
BUCK :
A cute dork.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.330
Okay. I'll take that.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.797
ABBY:
How are you

04:23.831 --> 04:25.599
How's your first day back?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.900
I feel great.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.069
Uh, no pain,
got minor discomfort,

04:29.102 --> 04:30.904
but, uh, don't you worry.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.240
I have someone monitoring
my bread intake.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.742
I'm so relieved.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.110
So, when are we gonna
do this again?

04:37.144 --> 04:40.280
I mean dinner,
not the tracheotomy.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.449
I don't know.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.517
Um, I have a run of shifts,

04:43.551 --> 04:45.185
but I will check the schedule.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.820
Are you buckling in?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.288
Uh, am I buckling in?

04:48.322 --> 04:49.623
Oh, full moon.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.191
It's gonna get bumpy.

04:51.224 --> 04:55.262
Uh, no. I do not buy into
all that full moon BS.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.930
Whoa, "buy into"?
No, no, no.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.265
It

04:58.298 --> 05:00.468
Every full moon,
the freaks come out.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.603
Crime increases,
emergency rooms are packed,

05:02.636 --> 05:05.606
animals and kids go nuts.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.207
No, in my experience,

05:07.240 --> 05:09.276
anyone who's gonna be an idiot
on the full moon

05:09.309 --> 05:11.211
is gonna be an idiot

05:11.244 --> 05:12.780
on the half moon
or the quarter moon

05:12.813 --> 05:14.715
or the no moon.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.818
There is no statistical evidence

05:17.851 --> 05:20.220
that any crime or accidents...

05:20.253 --> 05:22.222
...or general freakiness

05:22.255 --> 05:24.057
increase during the full moon.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.693
Abby, I just pulled a kid

05:25.726 --> 05:28.228
out of one of those stuffed
animal arcade games.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.463
I know, but that
would've happened

05:29.497 --> 05:30.531
whether it was a full moon
or not.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.665
Mm, you don't know that.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.200
I do know that.

05:33.233 --> 05:36.570
-How many full moons
have you worked? -Um, one.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.806
-Right. Bye, Buck.
: No, wait, hold on.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.508
Hold on. Look, I'm telling you.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.309
All right? Freaks come out.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.578
Now you call me
when the night's over, okay?

05:46.113 --> 05:49.617
Bye, Buck. Bye.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.993
What's he doing, ma'am?
Is he trying to get in?

06:00.027 --> 06:03.030
No. No, he's just
standing there.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.399
He's looking at me.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.902
I can't see his eyes,
but I can feel them.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.270
Why is he here?

06:10.303 --> 06:11.539
-It's okay, ma'am.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.006
Can you tell me your name
and address, please?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.443
Nora Curtis. 3942 Rosewood.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.845
ABBY: I'm dispatching police
to your location, Nora.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.279
Can you describe the man for me?

06:19.312 --> 06:21.348
I can't see his face.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.883
He doesn't have a face.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.552
Why doesn't he have a face?

06:24.585 --> 06:27.120
-Nora...
-I can't, I can't breathe.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.956
I can't breathe. I can't...

06:28.989 --> 06:31.258
It's so tight. I can't breathe.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.094
-It's okay. All right, help is
on the way, Nora.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.829
Just stay on the line with me.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.571
They called you for a prowler?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.205
Homeowner has a heart condition.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.940
ATHENA: Well, you two
traveling a little light.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.742
Yeah, a full moon.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.945
Only way to survive
is divide and conquer.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.081
Hmm, I believe it's your enemy
you're supposed to divide,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.483
not yourself.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.917
All right, I'm-a check
around back.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.852
-Okay.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.056
Paramedics.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.593
The paramedics are here.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.827
Thank you, Abby.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.328
You're welcome, Mrs. Curtis.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.396
Nora.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.832
You're welcome, Nora.

07:18.506 --> 07:22.843
While I was waiting for you,
he just seemed to disappear.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.778
Everything's gonna be okay.

07:24.812 --> 07:25.946
Blood pressure's dropping.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.281
Was I having a heart attack?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.617
No, no, no.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.752
Looks more like a panic attack.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.856
He gave me such a fright...

07:35.889 --> 07:38.692
standing out there...

07:38.726 --> 07:40.327
just staring.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.195
You're okay now. All right?

07:42.229 --> 07:44.431
Now, ma'am, I want you to
breathe for me, nice and slow,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.033
not too deep,
and when you exhale,

07:46.066 --> 07:48.301
I want you to purse your lips
like this.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.703
-Okay.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.338
You're safe now.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.674
Full moon. Brings out
the creeps and the crazies.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.511
Breathe, okay?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.112
Breathe.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.297
Ma'am, is this where
you were standing

08:17.330 --> 08:19.567
-Yes.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.037
Ma'am, I'm Sergeant Grant.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.339
If there was someone outside,
they're gone now.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.407
Thank you.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.743
-'Thena.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.482
ATHENA :
Yeah?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.918
It look to you like
anybody had been outside?

08:37.951 --> 08:41.254
No. I mean, the ground's wet.
Didn't see any footprints.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.857
I did.

08:46.359 --> 08:50.931
She says that she was standing
pretty much right over here.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.740
He was in the house.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.508
Standing right behind her.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.177
Okay. I just got the chills.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.512
He didn't attack her, though.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.681
Maybe that wasn't his intent

09:07.715 --> 09:10.751
or maybe when she called 911
it spooked him,

09:10.784 --> 09:13.386
but it looks like he came in
the front door.

09:15.488 --> 09:19.526
Ma'am, uh, you mind if I take
a look around the inside?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.294
Oh, no. Go ahead.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.063
Is there somewhere else
you can stay tonight?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.131
Someone you can call?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.633
Why?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.134
You think he's coming back?

09:27.167 --> 09:29.302
You've been through a lot
tonight.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.872
It might be best if you had
some company, that's all.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.273
I could call my daughter.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.608
That's a great idea.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.043
All clear here. Pulse is good.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.711
DISPATCHER:
P/R, unconscious male.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.614
MacArthur Park. Subject appears
to be unresponsive.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.083
CHIMNEY:
Copy. Paramedic 118 responding.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.918
That's a dicey neighborhood.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.486
I'll give you a police escort.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.088
Thanks.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.823
Ma'am, I have an officer
out front.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.091
He'll stay there until
your daughter picks you up.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.093
That's wonderful. Thank you.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.562
Remember to breathe.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.431
I will. Thank you.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.767
Absolutely. You just rest, okay?

09:59.800 --> 10:00.834
You're good now.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.637
Thank you both.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.438
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

10:05.472 --> 10:07.040
I'll tell you in the truck.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.118
What's your name?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.920
-Kathy.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.855
Kathy, where are you now?

10:21.889 --> 10:24.825
I... I... I locked
the front door

10:24.858 --> 10:26.593
and I'm upstairs in the bedroom.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.295
Is there anyone else with you?

10:28.328 --> 10:29.797
No, nobody.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.364
-He-He's in the house.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.166
He-he broke through the door.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.969
-Okay, Kathy.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.537
Kathy, are you still there?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.339
Uh-huh.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.142
Okay. Stay on the phone. Lock
the bedroom door if you can.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.811
-He's at the door.
He's at the door.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.713
-He's here, he's here!
-Okay, okay, Kathy,

10:45.746 --> 10:48.148
tell him you've called 911 and
the police are on their way.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.549
-I-I-I'm on...

10:49.582 --> 10:51.218
-I'm on with 911.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.220
-The police are coming.
-Kathy.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.823
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.457
Why are you here

10:57.490 --> 11:00.460
Why Why!

11:03.831 --> 11:05.198
Oh, my God.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.340
It's a fact. Gravity is heavier

11:13.373 --> 11:14.908
during full moons;
scientists have proven it.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.309
You read this
in a peer-reviewed,

11:16.343 --> 11:17.845
scientific publication?

11:17.878 --> 11:19.546
Uh, I don't know,
is the Internet considered

11:19.579 --> 11:21.148
a "scientific publication"?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.350
Buck, the idea that the moon
causes odd behavior

11:23.383 --> 11:26.019
and happenings goes back
to the first century.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.922
It's folklore, magical thinking.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.762
-Hey. She's this way.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.930
Jackie's six months pregnant.
She's new.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.933
This class is only open to moms
who are at least 26 weeks.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.402
I warn them about
overexerting themselves.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.405
And behold, the Salabhasana.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.943
Yeah, Locust Pose.

11:49.977 --> 11:53.246
I've dated, like,
50 yoga instructors.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.415
BOBBY: Can you guys please clear
out so we can get in there.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.017
-Ladies, back to your mats.
-Thank you, thank you.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.418
-I'll take it.
-JACKIE: I can't move.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.953
Everything hurts.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.554
The baby, is he okay?

12:01.588 --> 12:03.090
Okay, we're gonna
check your baby right now.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.892
Okay? I'm gonna touch you
right here on your stomach.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.794
Ooh.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.096
Okay. There's no trauma
to the abdomen.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.898
Vitals seem normal.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.632
-Fetal heartbeat's normal.
-Okay, good.

12:12.665 --> 12:13.767
Is the baby okay?

12:13.801 --> 12:15.102
Your baby is fine.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.236
Oh, he's not mine.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.805
-I'm a surrogate.
-Listen, can you

12:17.838 --> 12:19.206
tell me where
you're feeling your pain?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.041
Is it localized in your back,
your arms, your legs?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.442
:
Arms and legs,

12:22.475 --> 12:24.077
but it's-it's the worst
in my butt

12:24.111 --> 12:25.913
and down my thigh and calf.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.147
Okay, I think you
slipped a disc.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.615
We're gonna need to get her
on her side, okay?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.317
-Very carefully support her
head. -All right, got it, Bobby.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.419
Let's go this way towards
you guys, okay? Very gently.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.722
Oh...
-Okay...

12:35.755 --> 12:37.390
-All right, I'm gonna
take care of that. -I got it.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.959
-You take care of this.
-I got it. Go, go, go.

12:38.992 --> 12:39.993
BUCK: Here we go.
I got you, I got you.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.094
I think I'm having contractions.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.595
How far along are you?

12:42.629 --> 12:43.897
38 weeks.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.665
38 weeks. Okay.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.334
All right, just keep breathing
with your contractions.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.735
Nice and easy, all right?
What's your name?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.937
-Beth.
-Okay,

12:49.970 --> 12:52.239
-I need a cup of water for Beth.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.407
I think it's Braxton Hicks,
it's a soft labor.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.976
-That means

12:56.009 --> 12:57.177
your contractions
are gonna go away

12:57.210 --> 12:58.812
once we get you nice and relaxed
and hydrated, okay?

12:58.846 --> 13:00.613
-Okay. Mm-hmm.
-Just take a drink.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.817
Oh, my God. My water broke.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.018
* Baby, baby, baby

13:05.052 --> 13:06.153
-Yeah, I'm on it.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.155
Uh, Dispatch, requesting
additional paramedics

13:08.188 --> 13:10.824
to 232 Hope, possible
spinal disc herniation.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.325
Need transport to hospital
immediately.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.627
It's coming.
It's coming now.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.363
Yeah, you only just started
contractions, it's okay.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.298
No, this is my fourth kid.
It's coming.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.700
Uh, okay, I need towels!
I need towels!

13:20.733 --> 13:22.135
-Please, she's almost there.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.871
Okay, these contractions
are a minute apart.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.306
This isn't soft labor, is it?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.108
No. You're having your baby.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.776
Oh, my God, can I go
to the hospital?

13:29.809 --> 13:30.978
With contractions
this close together,

13:31.011 --> 13:32.345
I can't bring you
to the hospital.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.780
Transporting you's too risky
right now.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.882
But you're in good hands.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.016
I've delivered babies before.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.451
-Okay.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.488
Oh, no, no, not now.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.957
Seriously? I'm not... Bob,
I've never done this before.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.558
It's okay.
I will talk you through it.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.360
They say when a full moon's
halfway between

13:47.394 --> 13:48.695
the eastern horizon
and its highest point,

13:48.728 --> 13:49.863
it can induce labor.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.066
I knew I should have
canceled this class.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.367
Just saying, I did tell you.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.869
Okay, we can
discuss the moon later, Buck.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.537
If you're not in labor
right now, could you please

13:57.570 --> 14:00.207
go out in the hallway and
give us some space. Thank you.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.709
I have two,
possibly three women in labor.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.843
Membranes have ruptured.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.412
Labor is progressing rapidly.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.580
I need a couple of extra
transports to the hospital.

14:07.614 --> 14:12.085
Okay, Beth,
I need you to push, okay?

14:12.119 --> 14:15.055
I want my epidural!

14:15.088 --> 14:17.057
-Hey, Beth, you're doing great.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.425
-Okay, he's crowning.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.360
Buck, I need a towel.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.761
Coming. Got it.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.831
* Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

14:24.864 --> 14:26.599
* Baby, baby, I'm on a... *

14:26.633 --> 14:29.502
Okay, okay, Beth, I just need
one last big push.

14:34.407 --> 14:37.945
: Okay. All right,
you have a beautiful baby girl.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.580
Will you save the placenta?
I want to freeze it.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.249
Okay.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.850
-Yeah.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.586
-Okay, I got it.
-Okay. And cut.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.022
All right.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.257
-Good job.
-All right.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.558
Yeah, she's in this with you.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.527
Yeah, meet your mama.
There you go.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.363
Oh, thank you.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.764
All right, she knows.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.066
-* All right

14:59.099 --> 15:00.433
Oh, my God.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.069
-Okay.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.603
-BUCK: All right.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.272
All right. Okay.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.907
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.211
-I got her, I got her,
I got her. Go ahead.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.545
-Okay.
-Yep. Yep.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
Okay, just breathe.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.317
-Um, okay...

15:17.350 --> 15:20.287
Uh, just-just keep on
breathing. Um...

15:20.320 --> 15:22.122
Oh, my God, just go.
I got this.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.923
You're gonna deliver
your own baby?

15:23.957 --> 15:25.725
Yes, I told you, it's my fourth.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.793
And she's a doula.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.261
-Okay, uh, okay.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.597
Okay, okay.
What are you feeling?

15:30.630 --> 15:31.731
Something's wrong.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.266
I didn't feel like this
with my last baby.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.235
-Four foot 11.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.636
Did your doctor ever
tell you anything

15:36.669 --> 15:38.005
about the size of the baby?
Is it big or...?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.439
-Yeah, he's big.
-He's big. Okay.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.108
I saw the ultrasound.
His head is huge.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.909
-Okay,
I think you're experiencing

15:42.942 --> 15:45.345
something called CPD,
cephalopelvic disproportion.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.914
That means your baby's head
is too big for your pelvis.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.082
But you're gonna be okay.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.183
We're gonna get you
an emergency C-section.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.184
You're gonna be fine.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.419
-Guys, come on in.
-Oh, God.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.586
Right here.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.122
Is my baby gonna be okay?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.189
We need to call my husband.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.824
The baby's gonna be fine
and so are you.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.626
-Slow, slow, slow. -We'll call
your husband on the way.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.494
-There's no rush.
-Hey, don't push. There you go.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.831
-* Got me down in misery

16:04.864 --> 16:07.167
-It's a boy.
-Yes.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.602
Well, I'm Buck,
and that's Bobby,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.371
just in case you want to
name him after us.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.972
You know,
in our honor or something.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.507
No, I don't think so.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.678
You still think this
full moon stuff is a myth?

16:18.711 --> 16:20.780
Yes, and I still think
you're an idiot.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.949
St. Matthews,
contact OB surgical on call,

16:22.982 --> 16:25.718
we've got an emergency C-section
coming in, four minutes out.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.456
How you holding up?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.692
Um, hmm, just pissed...

16:32.725 --> 16:35.962
that I can't seem to shake this.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.067
Just keep hearing her screaming.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.401
It's okay if
you want to go home.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.969
I can cover you.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.539
Not gonna leave you in a lurch.

16:46.573 --> 16:51.744
On the full moon, which I don't
even really believe in.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.980
There's a detective here.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.516
He wants to hear the call, Abby.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.421
What kind of detective?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.989
Homicide.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.991
SUE:
This is Abby Clark.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.859
-She took the call.
-Detective Marks.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.695
Nice to meet you.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.897
-You wanted to hear the tape.
-Yeah, that'd be great.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.999
Uh, I've read
the fast transcript,

17:13.032 --> 17:16.169
but, uh, reading isn't the same
as hearing.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.438
No. It isn't. Come this way.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.374
KATHY: Why are you here?!
Why are you here?!

17:21.408 --> 17:24.777
Why!

17:31.084 --> 17:33.019
Well, thank you, Ms. Clark.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.254
Welcome.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.922
What were you hoping to hear?

17:35.955 --> 17:38.024
Well, things sometimes get
missed in the transcripts.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.226
I was hoping...

17:39.259 --> 17:41.394
You might hear his voice?

17:41.428 --> 17:43.963
Hard to hear anything
under these screams,

17:43.996 --> 17:46.366
even if he had said something.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.469
Maybe I could dig it out
if it's there.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.971
I mean, if that would help
you guys find him.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.240
Oh, we've already caught him.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.542
-Oh.
-Yeah, the ex-husband.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.145
She'd been granted multiple
protective orders against him.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.046
And he had been charged
with domestic battery

18:00.079 --> 18:01.914
on more than one occasion.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.151
She was afraid of him.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.618
Has he confessed?

18:05.652 --> 18:09.789
No. They, uh,
they generally don't.

18:09.822 --> 18:13.460
Now, if I had his voice
on that tape,

18:13.493 --> 18:14.961
it'd make things
a little bit easier,

18:14.994 --> 18:17.330
but, um, at least
he's off the streets.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.499
He's not going anywhere for now.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.302
Thank you for your time.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.337
Thank you.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.805
-Good luck with it.
-Thank you.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.360
Hey, Terry.

18:47.394 --> 18:50.763
Would you do me a favor?

18:50.797 --> 18:54.167
Would you check the system
for any 911 calls made

18:54.201 --> 18:58.638
from that number or address
in the last... three years?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.307
-Sure.
-Thanks.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.216
911. What's your emergency?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.017
KATHY:
Yes, my name is Kathy Blake.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.720
I'm at 837 Harper,
and my ex-husband

19:13.753 --> 19:15.555
is outside my front door.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.824
-TRENT: Open the door!
-His name is Trent McConnell

19:17.857 --> 19:20.327
and he's not supposed to be
within 50 yards of this house.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.129
TRENT: Open the door, you bitch.
I want my stuff.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.997
KATHY: Trent, you psycho,
I'm on the phone with the cops.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.499
Keep doing what you're doing

19:26.533 --> 19:28.201
if you want to spend the night
in jail again.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.136
Ma'am, I've dispatched officers
to your location.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.539
KATHY: I swear to God,
I am holding a butcher knife,

19:32.572 --> 19:34.474
and if you come through that
door before the police get here,

19:34.507 --> 19:37.910
-I will use it.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.979
He's at the door.
He's at the door!

19:40.012 --> 19:42.649
-He's here, he's here!

19:42.682 --> 19:45.818
Trent, you psycho,
I'm on the phone with the cops.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.854
Keep doing what you're doing
if you want to spend the night

19:47.887 --> 19:49.856
in jail again.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.824
Why are you here?!
Why are you here?!

19:51.858 --> 19:52.992
Why!

19:57.196 --> 20:00.833
It's not the husband.

20:00.867 --> 20:01.968
They got the wrong guy.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.795
So, basically, it's a twist on

20:28.828 --> 20:30.530
"the call came
from inside the house."

20:30.563 --> 20:32.131
Only it was a reflection
and there was no call,

20:32.164 --> 20:33.466
so it's nothing
like that at all.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.368
I don't know, a full moon...

20:35.402 --> 20:36.903
maybe it was a spirit.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.705
Spirits don't leave
muddy footprints.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.307
You don't know that. What if
it was raining in purga...

20:40.340 --> 20:41.541
Chimney, stop talking.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.809
CHIMNEY:
Copy that.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.680
Go. I got this.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.151
WOMAN:
Get off him! Stop!

20:52.184 --> 20:54.253
Help! Somebody help!

20:54.287 --> 20:56.623
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Slowly turn around

20:56.656 --> 20:58.458
-and show me your hands!

21:00.126 --> 21:02.228
What the hell is this kid on?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.563
Probably bath salts.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.764
It's a crazy mix of chemicals
that causes violent,

21:04.797 --> 21:05.965
psychotic behavior.

21:05.998 --> 21:06.966
ATHENA:
Step away from the man.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.134
Are you hearing me?!

21:08.167 --> 21:14.006
:
Turn around slowly.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.442
Did you see a weapon?
I don't see anything.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.243
I'm not sure, I don't...
No, I don't think so.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.945
ATHENA:
I'm not gonna ask you again!

21:43.169 --> 21:44.537
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.038
-I'm good.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.074
Yeah. Go.
Make sure that guy's okay.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.682
Detectives want
statements from both of us.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.385
-It's all you, Chim.

21:58.418 --> 22:02.555
Do I refer to the guy as
the perp or the face eater?

22:11.431 --> 22:13.332
This is Hen.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.967
EVA :
Well, it better be.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.836
I called her cell phone.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.738
Who is this?

22:18.771 --> 22:20.573
Palmar Women's
Correctional Facility.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.809
To accept the charges,
please press one.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.878
Yeah, I'm out, baby.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.046
No thanks to you.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.048
Eva, listen, about that...

22:29.081 --> 22:31.684
Relax, I'm just
messing with you.

22:31.718 --> 22:35.021
I put you
in an awkward position, I know.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.856
I apologize.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.859
Okay, well, thanks
for understanding.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.194
-A week.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.163
I wanted to make sure I had
my footing before I called you,

22:44.196 --> 22:46.533
so I got a job
at a small tax firm.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.735
You know, it's just
an entry-level thing,

22:48.768 --> 22:51.037
but if I work hard,
I can climb my way up.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.238
That's great.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.940
Um, listen,

22:53.973 --> 22:56.342
you-you kind of caught me
at a bad...

22:56.375 --> 22:57.444
Come over.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.212
-Come on.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.181
Come celebrate.
I want to show you my new place.

23:02.214 --> 23:06.018
It's not much, but, uh,
it's got a bed.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.423
You're awful.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.959
I know.

23:12.992 --> 23:17.129
So come over and let me
apologize for being so awful.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.031
Maybe I can, uh,

23:19.065 --> 23:21.367
put you in another
awkward position.

23:26.439 --> 23:30.142
Uh-- um, listen,
I'm-I'm glad you're home,

23:30.176 --> 23:32.244
and that, you know,
you're-you're doing well.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.981
Um, I am.

23:35.014 --> 23:38.284
But, uh, I got to go.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.119
Everything all right?

23:40.152 --> 23:42.388
Yeah, well, it is for now.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.056
I mean, so far,
no one's questioning

23:44.090 --> 23:45.792
whether or not it was justified.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.960
Hell, I wasn't gonna let
that monster eat my face.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.429
-You know,
it's gonna be a long night.

23:50.463 --> 23:53.132
Back to the station,
talk to OIS and the DA,

23:53.165 --> 23:55.234
and then, back here,
walk them through it.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.303
Probably have to ride the desk
for a couple of days

23:57.336 --> 23:59.772
till the DA is satisfied
there's nothing here.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.407
Hmm. I got your back
if they come calling.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.309
You always do.

24:03.342 --> 24:08.648
That wasn't your wife
on the phone, was it?

24:08.681 --> 24:10.983
Mm, no, it wasn't.

24:14.353 --> 24:15.955
Everything all right at home?

24:15.988 --> 24:17.256
It's fine.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.324
"Fine," huh?

24:18.357 --> 24:20.493
Mm-hmm.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.795
ATHENA:
Mm.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.664
Hen.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.766
Now, you know I love you.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.001
All right? Glass house,
all that jazz.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.270
But my advice,
you let it go long enough,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.105
ain't no coming back
from "fine."

24:33.139 --> 24:35.842
Everything was fine
in my marriage

24:35.875 --> 24:37.977
until the bomb went off.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.315
Athena, I appreciate
your concern, but we're good.

24:43.349 --> 24:46.052
Karen's not a bomb
waiting to go off.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.387
I wasn't talking about her.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.470
-TRENT: ...my stuff!
-KATHY: Trent, you psycho!

25:04.503 --> 25:06.472
I'm on the phone with the cops.
Just keep doing

25:06.505 --> 25:09.308
what you're doing if you want to
spend the night in jail again.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.977
Well?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.645
Right. This just confirms it.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.413
He had been harassing her
for years.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.015
Oh, yeah, but don't you hear
the difference

25:16.048 --> 25:17.516
between the two calls?

25:17.550 --> 25:20.486
I mean, when she was
with her ex-husband,

25:20.519 --> 25:23.155
she was upset,
but she was pushing back.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.757
You know, she was fighting him.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.392
And she called him by his name.

25:26.425 --> 25:27.927
Tonight,
she didn't mention a name,

25:27.960 --> 25:29.361
and it was completely different.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.263
It was like... blind terror.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.033
Because she finally realized
what he was capable of.

25:34.066 --> 25:37.169
It's dark, her focus is split
'cause she's talking to you.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.406
She may not have realized it was
her ex until it was too late.

25:40.439 --> 25:43.109
You know, a woman
with a history like that,

25:43.142 --> 25:45.411
I mean, if a guy's trying
to break in,

25:45.444 --> 25:48.514
she's gonna presuppose
that it's her ex.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.017
That's not the guy
who came in tonight.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.520
Look, it's clear you care
about what you do.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.289
I imagine you're not used
to losing one.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.592
I got to believe,
hearing someone die like that?

25:59.626 --> 26:02.061
Not an easy thing
to just shake off.

26:02.094 --> 26:05.564
Well, I take over 200 emergency
calls in a ten-hour shift.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.567
I don't just shake them off,
I move on.

26:08.601 --> 26:11.303
'Cause there's always
another call to move on to.

26:11.337 --> 26:14.641
-And I listen
to every single one.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.408
And I know
what I'm hearing here.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.144
Here's what I know.

26:18.177 --> 26:21.313
All right? 99% of the time,
the guy you think did it did it.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.549
It's my job to find
the evidence to prove it.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.753
And my job is to listen,
and hear what people tell me,

26:26.786 --> 26:28.287
and hear what
they don't tell me,

26:28.320 --> 26:30.389
and hear everything
that goes on around them.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.492
I'm telling you, the person
who killed that woman tonight

26:33.525 --> 26:35.327
is still out there.

26:35.361 --> 26:36.963
It wasn't her ex-husband.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.598
You can go ahead and include
this and any other calls

26:39.632 --> 26:42.034
from the victim
in what you're sending to us.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.503
We'll consider everything.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.108
Okay.

26:49.141 --> 26:52.144
Well, at least
he didn't pat me on the head.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.213
It's with the police, now.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.517
Well, you may not have convinced
him, but you convinced me.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.953
I think there's something else
you should hear.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.989
KATHY :
Yes. My name is Kathy Blake.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.590
I'm at 837 Harper,

27:04.623 --> 27:06.793
and my ex-husband
is outside my front door.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.194
WOMAN :
...about the restraining order.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.862
You hear that?

27:09.896 --> 27:11.864
-Here, let me dig it out.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.768
Yes. My name is Kathy Blake.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.770
I'm at 837 Harper,

27:17.804 --> 27:20.139
and my ex-husband is outside
my front door.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.741
WOMAN: Tell them
about the restraining order.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.377
There's somebody else there?

27:25.411 --> 27:26.979
KATHY:
...outside my front door.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.848
WOMAN: Tell them
about the restraining order.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.050
-A woman.
-Yeah.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.985
I mean, I don't know
what it gets you, exactly.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.687
It gets us eyes in the room.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.056
I mean, somebody who can tell us

27:37.089 --> 27:40.526
if Trent McConnell would
even be capable of this.

27:40.559 --> 27:44.663
Because the only other person
in the room is dead.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.200
So FID and the DA's office

27:48.234 --> 27:50.970
will run their investigations
and present it to the board.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.705
Until they make
their final determination,

27:52.739 --> 27:53.906
you're riding a desk.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.508
Yeah, I know the protocol.

27:56.542 --> 27:59.578
Listen, Sergeant,
no one wants to jam you up here.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.213
But it hasn't been that long

28:01.247 --> 28:03.149
since you got off
restricted desk duty.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.051
So just don't
give them a reason.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.719
If they come back to you
with more questions,

28:06.753 --> 28:08.220
-you call me first.

28:09.555 --> 28:10.689
It was a good shoot, Athena.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.091
I got your back, okay?

28:12.124 --> 28:13.359
-Yeah. Thanks, Jerry.
-All right.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.562
Yeah. Athena Grant.

28:16.595 --> 28:17.663
ABBY :
Sergeant.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.665
It's Abby Clark calling.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.267
Abby.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.402
So how's your night?

28:23.435 --> 28:24.837
Oh, you know...

28:24.871 --> 28:26.072
...a little unsettling tonight.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.706
More unsettling than performing

28:27.740 --> 28:30.209
an emergency tracheotomy
on a first date?

28:31.310 --> 28:32.411
You heard about that?

28:32.444 --> 28:33.846
Yeah, girl.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.447
All right,
what can I do for you tonight?

28:35.481 --> 28:38.350
ABBY: I'm trying to track down
a police report.

28:38.384 --> 28:41.788
I need to find a witness
on an old domestic call.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.023
-Yeah.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.392
October 29, 2015.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.727
837 Harper.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.963
Call came in
just before midnight.

28:50.997 --> 28:53.699
So what's got you
unsettled tonight?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.935
Home break-in turned murder.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.970
I might have you beat.

28:58.004 --> 29:01.974
I saw a man high on bath salts
eating another man's face.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.209
Oh, my God.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.111
Yeah, exactly.

29:05.144 --> 29:08.547
Oh, man, I'm starting to buy
into all this full moon crap.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.382
Still haven't seen
no werewolves.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.219
Okay, I got a Kathleen Blake,
filed a complaint

29:13.252 --> 29:15.754
against her estranged husband
Trent McConnell.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.290
Yeah, that's-that's it.
That's the one.

29:18.324 --> 29:21.260
And I may have
just found your witness.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.062
-That's weird.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.964
Nora Jane Curtis.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.133
I had a P/R by the same name
earlier tonight.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.767
No, wait.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.636
No, a different Nora Curtis.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.171
This one's 30 years younger.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.240
Wait, I took that call.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.675
There was a prowler
outside the house.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.911
Except he wasn't outside,
he was inside.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.512
She just didn't know it.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.281
Looked like a creep and peep.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.116
Didn't want to scare her
any more than she already was,

29:44.150 --> 29:46.853
so we suggested she spend
the night someplace else.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.754
Said she was gonna
call her daughter.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.689
The younger Nora Curtis?

29:50.722 --> 29:52.758
NORA:
This couch is fine for me, dear.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.861
I will not put you
out of your own bed.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.628
Seriously, Mom,

29:56.662 --> 29:58.497
we're not having
this conversation again.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.432
I don't want you sleeping
on the couch with your back.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.336
Hello?

30:04.370 --> 30:07.139
ABBY: Uh, hi, am I speaking
with Nora Jane Curtis?

30:07.173 --> 30:09.141
Yes. Who is this?

30:09.175 --> 30:11.110
This is Abby Clark,
I'm a 911 operator.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.545
I think I spoke
to your mother earlier tonight.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.381
You did. She's here.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.816
Are you actually checking up?

30:17.850 --> 30:19.351
That's so awesome.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.652
It's the 911 operator.

30:20.686 --> 30:21.888
Abby?

30:21.921 --> 30:24.056
That is so sweet.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.457
I didn't know they did that.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.359
ABBY:
Something happened tonight

30:27.393 --> 30:29.661
to an acquaintance of yours,
Kathleen Blake.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.998
Kathy? She's not just
an acquaintance.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.800
She saved my life.
What happened?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.069
Uh, I'm so sorry, I can't
disclose the details of that.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.404
Can you tell me what you mean

30:38.437 --> 30:40.006
when you say
she saved your life?

30:40.039 --> 30:41.473
Mm, Kathy runs a support group

30:41.507 --> 30:43.709
for survivors
of domestic violence.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.544
She herself
is a victim of abuse,

30:45.577 --> 30:48.080
and she gave me the courage
to finally escape.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.515
I mean, she even helped me
rent a place

30:49.548 --> 30:50.983
where my ex couldn't find me.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.584
Does your ex

30:52.618 --> 30:54.320
Yes.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.523
She let me stay with her
a few times when things got bad.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.025
What's going on?

30:59.058 --> 31:00.392
Okay, I need you
to give me your address

31:00.426 --> 31:01.693
where are you right now, please.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.029
Oh, God.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.499
11207 Collins, North Hollywood.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.535
ABBY: The police think
Kathy was attacked

31:09.568 --> 31:11.403
-by her ex-husband tonight...

31:11.437 --> 31:13.439
...but I think
it was your ex-husband,

31:13.472 --> 31:14.873
and he's been looking for you.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.443
Oh, my God.

31:17.476 --> 31:18.444
It's him, he's here.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.545
He found me. How did he find me?

31:19.578 --> 31:21.047
Did he do something to Kathy?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.448
Nora Jane, stay on the line.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.416
Okay? Help is on the way.

31:25.717 --> 31:26.885
MAN:
Nora Jane!

31:26.919 --> 31:28.120
What's happening, Nora Jane?

31:29.455 --> 31:31.390
Nora Jane?!

31:33.459 --> 31:35.394
-Nora Jane!
-He's in the house.

31:37.563 --> 31:38.764
Police are two minutes out.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.772
MAN: I told you
I'd find you, you bitch!

31:46.805 --> 31:48.140
-I don't know what's going on.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.714
MAN:
I told you.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.883
You can't hide forever.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.586
NORA JANE:
I'm done hiding.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.827
Nora Jane?

32:11.263 --> 32:14.266
Nora Jane?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.102
NORA JANE:
I think he's dead.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.436
What?

32:17.469 --> 32:19.271
What happened

32:19.305 --> 32:21.773
We're fine.

32:21.807 --> 32:23.775
I was ready for him this time.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.511
Thanks to you.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.778
Good.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.880
Good, well, help is on the way.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.684
She's okay. Okay.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.665
I'm sorry, did you say
there's something inside you?

32:46.698 --> 32:48.300
: Connor?

32:48.334 --> 32:50.136
Connor, open the door,
let me in.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.770
CONNOR:
Absolutely not. Go away.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.971
Sir, are you in danger?

32:53.005 --> 32:54.840
Is there someone trying
to get into your house?

32:54.873 --> 32:57.943
CONNOR: No! There's something
inside of me. I can feel it.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.179
Sir, what is your address,
please?

33:00.212 --> 33:01.947
I can feel it moving.
What is happening?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.183
What is your address, sir?
I need your address.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.551
CONNOR:
Oh, what is happening?

33:05.584 --> 33:08.487
There's a monster inside of me!

33:08.520 --> 33:10.822
Damn it, Connor.

33:10.856 --> 33:13.125
-Let me in.
-Go away.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.727
-You're scaring me.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.530
I'm John Hurt in Alien
right now.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.632
-Oh. Thank God.
: Help.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.634
Connor? 911's here.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.503
Open the door now.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.138
All right, step aside, sir.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.340
Connor?
Los Angeles Fire Department.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.210
We can't help you
if you don't open the door.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.680
Connor, I don't want to have
to break this door down.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.016
Can you tell me
what you're feeling?

33:38.050 --> 33:39.485
Something's happening.
It's, like, the...

33:39.518 --> 33:41.487
like, the worst
cramping pressure feeling

33:41.520 --> 33:43.089
that I've ever experienced--

33:43.122 --> 33:44.390
it's like I'm gonna give birth
or something.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.593
Oh, stop it.
We had sushi tonight.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.928
He always orders the omakase,
but he can't handle anyone

33:49.961 --> 33:52.030
telling him what to do,
so he orders more...

33:53.299 --> 33:54.733
You just have an upset stomach.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.735
If you tell me I just have
a stomachache one more time,

33:56.768 --> 33:59.071
I'm gonna stab you
with your toothbrush.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.440
I swear, I felt it moving, okay?
I felt something moving.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.175
How long have you
been having the cramps?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.543
Uh, about a week.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.378
Yeah, I made a doctor's
appointment for Friday.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.214
-No.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.516
Oh, he's been having
a lot of gas.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.118
-Shut up!
-You have.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.086
I mean, i-it kind of builds
like an overture,

34:14.120 --> 34:16.455
and then there's
a nice little tuba solo.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.957
It's a tremendous amount
of horrible flatulence.

34:18.990 --> 34:22.794
: Paul. -Okay, just
lean back, let me have a look.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.297
-Okay.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.366
He does-- about
four or five times a week.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.968
I try to go carb- and fat-free
as often as possible.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.138
Ah, same here. You guys
ever try the brown rice pasta?

34:32.171 --> 34:33.739
You know, it's not that bad.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.574
You know, it's a little gummy
for my taste.

34:35.607 --> 34:36.775
-I see that.
-Yeah.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.043
Hey, what's
your body fat percentage?

34:38.076 --> 34:40.412
-I swing between, like, 50...
-Okay, can we finish

34:40.446 --> 34:42.648
the most interesting
conversation of all time later?

34:45.016 --> 34:47.653
-No.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.488
What about your bowel movements?
Any diarrhea?

34:49.521 --> 34:52.291
-No.
-Yes. Why would you lie

34:52.324 --> 34:54.059
to him about that?
He's trying to help you.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.462
Okay. Sorry. Yes.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.430
He has poop shame.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.567
-Okay. Just take a deep breath,
okay

35:01.600 --> 35:03.635
-Take a deep breath.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.003
Oh, my God! No, no, no!

35:05.036 --> 35:06.672
I'm gonna burst!
I'm gonna explode!

35:06.705 --> 35:08.974
-Let's get him
in the ambulance right...

35:14.280 --> 35:15.981
God, just make it stop!

35:16.014 --> 35:17.816
Drive faster.
I feel like I'm gonna explode

35:17.849 --> 35:19.985
-all over the place. -All right,
Connor, you're doing great.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.653
We're almost to the hospital.
They're gonna do a scan,

35:21.687 --> 35:23.088
figure out
exactly what's going on.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.590
Th-There's something
under my leg.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.992
It's just the IV tube,
all right? It's underneath you.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.760
No, no, no, it's moving. There's
something moving under my leg.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.430
-All right, let's turn him
and check it out.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.532
-Oh!

35:36.735 --> 35:39.538
-That's a tapeworm.
I have a tapeworm?!

35:39.571 --> 35:40.706
Wait, it's coming out of his...

35:40.739 --> 35:42.308
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.610
-Oh, get it out. Get it out!
-Oh, I can see the mouth.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.945
-I mean, we can pull it out.
-No. No, no, absolutely not.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.847
We're almost to the hospital--
they're gonna remove that

35:48.880 --> 35:50.616
with the proper instruments,
put him on some albendazole,

35:50.649 --> 35:52.050
and then we call it a night.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.985
No, please, no.
I can't take those drugs.

35:54.019 --> 35:55.721
They're toxic.
They put me on Flagyl

35:55.754 --> 35:58.524
for diverticulitis once,
and it gave me severe heartburn

35:58.557 --> 36:00.792
and turned my pee burnt sienna.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.694
I'm sorry, burnt sienna?

36:02.728 --> 36:04.730
It was brown!
Okay? It was dark brown.

36:04.763 --> 36:08.334
Now, just please,
I am begging you, get it out!

36:08.367 --> 36:09.568
It's all you, Buck.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.803
Really?
So you have no problem

36:11.837 --> 36:14.340
delivering a baby,
but this creeps you out?

36:14.373 --> 36:15.674
Seniority has its advantages.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.910
-Just get it out...
-Okay.

36:18.944 --> 36:19.978
What are you waiting for?
Get it out.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.847
I have to be careful, all right?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.882
If it breaks, it'll crawl back
inside and regenerate.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.253
-Oh...
-I'm definitely gonna puke.

36:27.286 --> 36:32.190
I knew you didn't go from
a 34 to a 31 waist with sit-ups.

36:32.224 --> 36:35.327
Tapeworms are an old fashioned
model's trick for losing weight.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.762
You know, these things can live

36:36.795 --> 36:38.697
-inside of you for,
like, 20 years? -Ugh!

36:38.730 --> 36:41.367
PAUL: This is insane-- it's
like a magician's handkerchief.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.569
Actually, it kind of makes
perfect sense.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.036
All the sushi you guys eat.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.239
It's like playing
Russian roulette with parasites.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.241
And with the moon--
parasitic breeding cycles

36:49.275 --> 36:51.443
rise and fall
with the full moon.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.111
Will you shut up about the moon?

36:53.144 --> 36:54.880
I honestly don't know
how you're so calm about this.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.882
It's nature, you know?

36:56.915 --> 36:58.884
-Circle of life.
-PAUL: Yeah, I don't think

36:58.917 --> 37:01.553
that's what Elton John
had in mind when he wrote that.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.422
Man, this has to be, like...

37:03.455 --> 37:05.957
-six or seven feet.
-Oh, God.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.793
Have you been worn down lately?
This thing has been stealing

37:07.826 --> 37:10.396
-all your nutrients. -How do you
know so much about tapeworms?

37:10.429 --> 37:12.698
I tended bar one summer at
a surf beach in South America.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.766
These things are as common...

37:14.800 --> 37:16.802
as...

37:16.835 --> 37:18.804
-Oh! Oh!

37:18.837 --> 37:21.072
-...housecats.
-Oh, God.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.475
-Whoa.
-Congratulations, Connor.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.076
It's a boy.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.355
Abby?

37:38.490 --> 37:39.958
Hi, Detective.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.460
Ms. Clark, I'm, uh...

37:41.493 --> 37:43.395
well, I'm glad I caught you
before you left.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.897
I, uh...

37:45.931 --> 37:49.167
Well, I wanted to apologize
in person.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.469
Oh.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.304
You didn't have to do that.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.506
No, I do.
Uh, I had the wrong man,

37:54.540 --> 37:57.309
you tried to tell me,
and... I didn't listen.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.911
And I still can't figure out

37:59.945 --> 38:02.147
how you put
all the pieces together.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.582
I had a lot of help.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.518
And...
I do think it was lucky

38:06.552 --> 38:11.590
that I got that first call from
the intended victim's mother.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.959
Other than that,
I'm not really sure

38:13.992 --> 38:15.927
how all the pieces
go together, either.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.964
Well, we think the suspect
broke into the mother's house

38:18.997 --> 38:21.367
probably expecting that's
where his ex-wife was staying.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.002
And once he found
she wasn't there,

38:24.035 --> 38:25.471
well, he went to the person

38:25.504 --> 38:27.272
he held responsible
for her leaving.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.974
-Kathleen Blake.
-Yeah. We found her laptop

38:29.007 --> 38:32.711
in his car-- that's...
how he got the address.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.146
I mean, I'm just glad
he didn't do the same thing

38:35.180 --> 38:37.182
-to Nora Jane's mother.
-Well, Nora Jane says

38:37.215 --> 38:40.185
her ex always liked
the old lady, had a...

38:40.218 --> 38:42.220
well, a soft spot for her.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.656
People are strange.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.158
That's one way of looking at it,
yeah.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.694
Yeah.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.862
Well, thank you again.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.632
-Thank you. Appreciate it.
-Yeah.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.601
*

38:59.838 --> 39:03.375
Girl, are you sittin' down?

39:03.409 --> 39:05.677
I'm-I'm driving home.
Why, something's up?

39:05.711 --> 39:08.013
I'm looking at this tox report--
you're not gonna believe it.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.481
The face eater?

39:09.515 --> 39:11.483
Nothing but alcohol
in his system.

39:11.517 --> 39:14.820
No MDPV, no methylone,
methedrone.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.756
No cathinone of any kind.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.225
What? So this guy was just
out here eating people's faces

39:20.258 --> 39:21.660
'cause he felt like it?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.061
I guess he really was hungry.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.863
I mean, his blood sugar levels
were low.

39:26.532 --> 39:29.568
There was a Burger King
a block away.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.870
Girl, it must be the full moon.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.906
Athena, I gotta go.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.176
'Kay. All right, you be careful
out there, full moon or not.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.012
This is one of those nights
people act like fools.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.048
-Yeah, you, too.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.791
You changed your mind.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.868
You look good.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.070
Freedom agrees with me.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.575
*

40:13.344 --> 40:16.114
I should go home now.

40:16.147 --> 40:19.250
So what's stopping you?

40:19.284 --> 40:21.453
I don't know.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.744
Hi.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.312
So, I was driving home,

40:47.345 --> 40:48.947
and I hit a red light.

40:50.281 --> 40:54.753
Uh, and I looked up
at the moon...

40:54.786 --> 40:56.354
um...

40:56.387 --> 40:58.456
and before I knew it,

40:58.490 --> 41:01.793
I was pulling
into a liquor store

41:01.827 --> 41:03.529
to buy us this bottle of wine.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.664
And then I drove straight here.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.166
Did the moon
cast a spell on you?

41:09.735 --> 41:11.102
It's real.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.604
It's gravity.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.807
* And all the time
we thought we did *

41:15.841 --> 41:18.544
And it pulls people together.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.812
Mm, no, actually--

41:20.846 --> 41:22.714
you know this, right?--

41:22.748 --> 41:25.316
the phases of the moon
are caused by its positioning

41:25.350 --> 41:27.218
relative to the sun

41:27.252 --> 41:29.487
and the sun's shadow,
like, it doesn't actually get

41:29.521 --> 41:31.990
-I don't
think that's actually true.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.992
:
Oh, no, that's definitely true.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.863
: Yeah. Really.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.032
Um, well, even better.

41:41.066 --> 41:44.603
You know? 'Cause... then science
got nothing to do with it.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.673
It's magic.

41:47.706 --> 41:48.907
Mm, nope.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.076
Not magic, either.

41:52.544 --> 41:54.345
*

41:54.379 --> 41:57.348
Maybe it's not science or magic.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.384
* I held your hand
until the light *

41:59.417 --> 42:02.053
Maybe you just really wanted
to see me.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.556
* The scars were on the back

42:07.859 --> 42:11.196
* And all the time
we were the right *

42:13.031 --> 42:16.367
* Was it just retract?

42:18.904 --> 42:22.173
* And they can try
to put you down *

42:22.207 --> 42:23.709
* Wear you out

42:23.742 --> 42:26.812
* Get you through the idea
of the luck *

42:29.748 --> 42:32.918
* Well, I thought you were
the sweetest kill *

42:35.721 --> 42:38.056
* Did we even know?

42:42.460 --> 42:44.930
* All the time, we get by

42:44.963 --> 42:47.098
* Trying to figure out
our lives... *

42:47.132 --> 42:49.067
HEN:
People who are drawn together

42:49.100 --> 42:51.436
don't have the protection
of the laws of gravity

42:51.469 --> 42:53.204
to keep them apart.

42:53.238 --> 42:54.405
* All the time...

42:54.439 --> 42:56.975
The consequences don't matter

42:57.008 --> 42:59.077
when we're drawn
to one another.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.847
All that matters is the power
of that touch.

43:03.181 --> 43:05.450
Skin to skin.

43:05.483 --> 43:06.885
* We get by

43:06.918 --> 43:09.988
* Trying to figure out
our lives *

43:11.289 --> 43:13.591
* Like a fade-out...

43:13.625 --> 43:17.262
*

43:17.295 --> 43:20.899
But there are
always consequences.

43:20.932 --> 43:23.301
Eventually, the moon sets

43:23.334 --> 43:25.170
and the sun rises,

43:25.203 --> 43:27.939
and whatever happened
in the magic of that moonlight

43:27.973 --> 43:31.109
has to face the hard truth...

43:31.142 --> 43:32.644
of the light of day.

44:10.849 --> 44:13.685
