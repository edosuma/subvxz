WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.202
Only on Fox.

00:03.503 --> 00:05.973
Narrator:
Previously...

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
- Please welcome back...
- ( cheering )

00:08.041 --> 00:10.878
Christina Tosi.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.980
the ultimate
baking challenge...

00:13.013 --> 00:15.482
Who stays and who goes
is all in your hands.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.517
meant the end of the road...

00:17.551 --> 00:19.519
You had the worst cupcakes
in the MasterChef kitchen,

00:19.553 --> 00:22.155
so we have to say good-bye.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.225
...for Mark.

00:25.258 --> 00:28.228
Tonight, the judges...

00:28.261 --> 00:30.363
Rocking and rolling, baby.
I love it.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.232
join the hottest
challenge...

00:32.265 --> 00:34.902
- Whoo-wee!
- ...of the season.

00:34.935 --> 00:39.339
Fried squash blossom, caviar.
I have to top that.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.541
- And...
- Savory or sweet?

00:41.575 --> 00:44.377
- a divided kitchen...
- This is it. Let's go!

00:44.411 --> 00:45.946
- That is not pretty.
- produces...

00:45.979 --> 00:48.015
- ( bleep ), man.
- ...shocking results.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.917
What is that?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.468
- Whoo! Top 13.
- Whoo!

01:08.501 --> 01:10.137
- Hey!
- 1-3, 1-3.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.305
Being in the top 13 means
everything to me.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.574
So I really want to
show myself and the judges,

01:14.608 --> 01:17.945
especially Gordon, my mentor,
that there's more to me

01:17.978 --> 01:20.380
than just a 21-year-old
college kid from Los Angeles.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.250
Welcome back.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.319
Shanika is bold and fierce
and ready to fight.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.488
I am going to show
my mentor Joe

01:28.521 --> 01:31.091
that I will be
the next MasterChef.

01:33.526 --> 01:36.563
You all have survived some
difficult challenges,

01:36.596 --> 01:39.566
and now it's time
for another one.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.602
The iconic mystery box
challenge.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.973
Right,
on the count of three,

01:46.006 --> 01:48.942
lift your boxes.

01:48.976 --> 01:53.513
One, two, three.

01:54.547 --> 01:57.184
- Oh!
- Ooh.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.352
What?

01:59.386 --> 02:01.454
Oil?

02:01.488 --> 02:05.826
Right. Tonight, you're all
gonna be deep-frying.

02:05.859 --> 02:09.096
Wow, this mystery box challenge
is made for me.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.865
I probably fry something up
once a week,

02:11.899 --> 02:14.001
and today I'm gonna fry
this whole competition.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.336
We wanna see a fully
composed dish

02:16.369 --> 02:19.306
where the star is deep-fried.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.810
And you have
just 45 minutes to do it.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.444
Now, the person

02:24.477 --> 02:27.380
with the best dish
in the mystery box challenge

02:27.414 --> 02:30.150
will win a huge advantage.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.120
And, trust me,
you wanna win this one.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.655
To aid in making
the best possible dish,

02:35.689 --> 02:39.292
you'll have access
to the full MasterChef pantry.

02:39.326 --> 02:44.397
And of course, you'll have
the incredible Viking stoves
to work with.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.234
- Is everybody ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

02:47.267 --> 02:51.404
Well, I'm sorry,
but we're not.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.907
Because there's a twist.

02:53.941 --> 02:58.178
You'll also be cooking along
three incredible guest chefs.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.750
- Oh!
- Us!

03:02.783 --> 03:06.586
( cheering )

03:06.619 --> 03:09.589
I'm so excited to be cooking
alongside my culinary heroes.

03:09.622 --> 03:12.359
There's just so much
to learn from them,

03:12.392 --> 03:14.061
and people would die for this
type of opportunity.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.496
- Right. You guys ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

03:16.529 --> 03:21.401
I guess it's
our 45 minutes starts now!

03:21.434 --> 03:23.136
Let's go.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.240
Keep it moving!

03:27.274 --> 03:30.443
- Cucumbers, cucumbers.
- Aarón, you'll go straight

03:30.477 --> 03:31.879
for the Sriracha
and mayonnaise, right?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.113
( Aarón laughs )
Exactly.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.784
- Do y'all see
bread crumbs anywhere?
- Oh, here, here, here.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.451
S.J., you want
a glass of wine?

03:38.485 --> 03:39.920
I'm okay.
Thank you, Chef.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.755
- Emily.
- Yes, Joe.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.290
Do they have
Shiitake mushrooms?

03:43.323 --> 03:45.292
- Yes, they do.
- Gordon: Joe, seriously?

03:45.325 --> 03:47.460
- Grab a couple
for me. Thanks.
- Really?

03:47.494 --> 03:49.562
- Are you just having
wine and cheese?
- What are you making?

03:49.596 --> 03:52.065
I'm keeping it Italian.
So I think you'll
be happy with it.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.468
I'm not afraid of frying.
I come from Wisconsin.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.104
If you can batter it
and deep-fry it,

03:57.137 --> 03:58.305
we've probably done it.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.107
And, obviously,
this challenge

04:00.140 --> 04:02.375
is taking something
that's fried and elevating it.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.913
So I'm making a spinach and
mushroom stuffed fried ravioli

04:05.946 --> 04:08.882
over a pomodoro sauce
with a crispy chip of Pancetta

04:08.916 --> 04:12.285
- and a fried basil leaf.
- Farhan, can you pass me
some leeks?

04:12.319 --> 04:16.723
- Yes, Chef.
- And zucchinis.

04:16.756 --> 04:19.426
- Some snap peas.
- Joe, come on! Please?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.428
This is the difference
between me and you guys.

04:21.461 --> 04:24.097
- This is how I shop.
- Let's go, guys.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.403
Gentlemen, I've selected
a beautiful mid-80s
Côte-Rtie for us

04:30.437 --> 04:32.806
- to share while we cook.
- Joe, come on, we're busy.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.275
- Aarón, keep an eye on him
in case he needs a break.
- Yes, sir.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.311
Absolutely.
He might get winded.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.648
I'm from the dirty South.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.417
So, with that being said,
we fry just about everything.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.754
So, today I'm gonna make some
fried salmon croquettes,

04:47.787 --> 04:50.958
and I'm going to do a sweet
potato hash with red peppers.

04:50.991 --> 04:54.161
It is definitely
a dish that my mom has
made for us growing up.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.163
And so it's just something
where it makes me feel at home.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.764
You know growing up,

04:57.797 --> 04:59.666
Mexican food was one
of my favorite foods to eat.

04:59.699 --> 05:03.170
So I'm making a traditional
Indian style bhajiya,

05:03.203 --> 05:05.672
but I'm kind of infusing
some flavors of Mexico.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.774
So I'm using chipotle
to make a caramelized

05:07.807 --> 05:10.277
onion chipotle sauce
to go along with it.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.679
Guys, just over
35 minutes left.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.614
35 minutes left.

05:14.647 --> 05:18.018
I am going to be making
spicy pork empanada,

05:18.051 --> 05:20.487
and also a squash blossom
quesadilla.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.990
The reason I'm making this dish
is because I have an aunt

05:23.023 --> 05:26.326
in Mexico who makes her living
by running a quesadilla stand.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.062
So, this dish is really
something that speaks

05:29.096 --> 05:31.564
to my family heritage,
my culture,

05:31.598 --> 05:34.201
and it's also something
that reminds me of home.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.538
Chef Aarón, what are you
grinding over there?

05:38.571 --> 05:40.673
I'm making
a crispy oyster taco,

05:40.707 --> 05:42.575
my friend,
with chile habanero

05:42.609 --> 05:44.344
and chayote and jicama slaw.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.646
Oh, that sounds amazing.
What are you making, Joe?

05:46.679 --> 05:48.848
- I'm making Frito Misto.
- Ooh, nice!

05:48.882 --> 05:51.818
So mixed fresh bay fish,
calamari, lemons,

05:51.851 --> 05:54.321
zucchini, tiger shrimp.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.755
Joe, is this a dish

05:55.788 --> 05:57.724
that has been in
your family's restaurant?

05:57.757 --> 06:00.193
This is a dish from my young
years in Italy, from our house.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.262
Fried calamari's
a grand classic,

06:02.295 --> 06:03.696
and it's something
that we always have.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.598
Hey, Chef, can I ask
what you're doing right now?

06:05.632 --> 06:08.568
Stuffing these wonderful
squash bottoms with fresh crab,

06:08.601 --> 06:11.038
and then we're gonna
deep-fry them.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.440
And that's going to
be served with a caviar
and Granny Smith vinaigrette.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.043
- Wow.
- And a light citrus
fragrance inside, yes?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.245
- Tell me what you're doing.
- Yes. This sounds amazing.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.380
So I'm doing, like,
an Asian style fish and chips

06:20.413 --> 06:22.182
with a roasted miso
and garlic aioli,

06:22.215 --> 06:23.750
along with a pickle,

06:23.783 --> 06:27.287
- green onion and pear slaw.
- Love it.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.057
Guys, we're down
to 20 minutes remaining.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.425
Oh, my God.
You can do this, Chelsea.

06:32.459 --> 06:35.362
Ralph, talk to me.
What's the motivation over here?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.264
Filipinos
and chicken adobo

06:37.297 --> 06:39.266
are synonymous
with each other.

06:39.299 --> 06:42.202
And so doing
a deep-fried version of it
served with rice.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.072
- Ralph. You've got really
big pieces of chicken.
- Yes, Chef. Yes, sir.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.307
Normally, those chicken thighs
take 20 minutes to cook.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.042
Yes, Chef. I think
I'm gonna take this bone out,

06:49.076 --> 06:50.978
get the oven ready just in case
I need to put it in there.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.113
- I want something immaculate.
- Yes, Chef, will do.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.149
And there we go. Whew!

06:56.183 --> 06:58.651
- Chelsea. What's the plan?
What are you making?
- Yes.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.988
I'm doing one of my favorite
things to cook at home
for my boyfriend,

07:01.021 --> 07:04.624
a roasted beet salad
with a fried risotto ball.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.994
- Do we know what
they're called? Arancini.
- Arancini, yes.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.661
How did you flavor the risotto?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.330
I mean, I wanna go rich
and luxurious,

07:10.363 --> 07:12.599
that's why
I'm putting goat cheese
and vegetable stock.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.102
- All right, Chelsea.
Good luck.
- Thank you.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.305
- Shanika, talk to me.
What are you making?
- Yes.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.939
I am making risotto balls

07:19.973 --> 07:22.475
that has apple
and pancetta in it.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.411
Really wanna impress
my mentor Joe tonight,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.247
so I'm gonna go
with classic Italian,
but with just a little twist.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.917
My aunt used to cook
a lot of fried food
when we were younger,

07:30.950 --> 07:33.320
but as I grew up,
I knew that it
was not good for you.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.921
- Wasn't good for the figure.
- Got you.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.790
So I cut that out
and baked and broiled.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.626
Okay, you look like
you're comfortable.
Get that rice cooked

07:39.659 --> 07:40.994
- and cooled down. Let's go.
- I am getting it cooked.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.596
Gordon:
Two minutes remaining.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.832
Let's hope
they come out right.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.604
Oh, they look good.
They look good.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.041
Let's go, guys, come on.
Nice and beautiful.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.908
Check your seasoning.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.948
Gordon:
60 seconds to go. Come on!

08:01.981 --> 08:03.383
Start plating guys.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.985
- This is it!
- Ooh, it's good!

08:06.019 --> 08:07.520
15 seconds to go, guys.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.189
Aarón:
Come on!

08:09.222 --> 08:10.723
Keep going, keep going,
keep going.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.063
- Gordon: Here we go.
- Judges: Ten, nine,

08:16.096 --> 08:20.033
eight, seven, six, five,

08:20.067 --> 08:23.636
four, three, two, one.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.173
- Gordon: And stop. Well done!
- Aarón: That's it.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.775
- Aarón: Beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.747
Gordon:
Amazing deep-frying.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.583
All of you, well done.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.386
- I think we did
a great job as well.
- Absolutely.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.720
Gordon: Everybody,
would you like to come down
and look what we made?

08:40.753 --> 08:42.789
- Yes!
- Come down. Let's go.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.692
Oh, that looks
spectacular, Chef.

08:45.725 --> 08:46.993
It looks so good, Chef.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.995
So, start off
with this dish here.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.597
Squash blossom stuffed
with a beautiful crab.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.599
And then a tempura batter

08:52.632 --> 08:54.434
lightly dipped
with that vadouvan spice,

08:54.467 --> 08:57.870
served on a caviar vinaigrette
with Granny Smith apples.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.607
And right here we have
a beautiful crispy oyster taco

09:00.640 --> 09:02.609
with a chile habanero aioli,

09:02.642 --> 09:05.612
a beautiful shaved chayote
and jicama slaw,

09:05.645 --> 09:08.215
pickled red fresnos,
and, of course,
a little bit of aguacate.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.949
And tell me that is not
an invitation to eat, y'all.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.718
- There's an invitation.
- Right?

09:11.751 --> 09:14.221
I don't need to sell my dish.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.123
It's called Frito Misto.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.025
It's basically scampi,
calamari, heads and tentacles,

09:19.058 --> 09:22.862
lemon, zucchini, salty,
lemony, citrusy.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.864
It's a perfect taste
of the goods

09:24.897 --> 09:26.633
when the sea gives up
the right stuff.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.369
- Dig in. Let's go.
- Awesome!

09:29.402 --> 09:31.404
That looks so good. Damn!

09:31.438 --> 09:33.806
- Oh, my God.
- This is amazing!

09:33.840 --> 09:35.708
Gordon and Aarón
and Joe's dishes

09:35.742 --> 09:37.144
just put us all to shame.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.811
I mean, there's no other way
to say it.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.248
All of you, head back
to your stations, please.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.049
- Thank you.
Thank you so much, Chef.
- Well done. Well done.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.051
It just shows
that frying food doesn't need

09:45.084 --> 09:47.454
to necessarily
be heavy and dense.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.722
It can be something
that you could go out and buy

09:49.756 --> 09:51.591
at high-end
fine dining restaurant.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.126
Whilst we were cooking,

09:53.160 --> 09:55.128
we did get a chance
to check in with you guys

09:55.162 --> 09:57.830
and taste everything
you were doing

09:57.864 --> 09:59.732
across those 45 minutes.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.335
And the first dish
that we really enjoyed,

10:02.369 --> 10:06.606
we can't wait to taste again,
incorporated a risotto.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.777
Congratulations...

10:10.810 --> 10:14.080
- Shanika.
- What?

10:14.113 --> 10:16.183
I'm shocked.
I'm shocked.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.851
For the first time ever,
I'm in the top three right now.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.653
Did this really just happen?

10:20.687 --> 10:22.689
I mean, I gotta pinch myself.

10:22.722 --> 10:26.193
Oh, it happened.
It's real.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.596
Finally. Welcome
to the top three.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.298
Shanika:
Oh, my God!
It feels amazing.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.932
Gordon:
Well done. Describe
the dish, please.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.802
You have an apple
pancetta risotto cake

10:35.835 --> 10:38.705
on a bed of kale
that has a little bit of lemon

10:38.738 --> 10:41.208
cooked in chicken stock,
tomatoes, salt and pepper.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.944
How did you get the pancetta
in there? What'd you do?

10:44.977 --> 10:46.679
I fried it up first,
and I put it in
at the last minute

10:46.713 --> 10:49.716
with the last batch
of apples.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.884
Mmm. Wow.
I love the arancini.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.721
And I love what you did
with the apple, 'cause
that makes it lighter.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.122
So we're thinking
of the fried food,

10:56.155 --> 10:58.391
and we're thinking heavy,
sedated, greasy.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.892
And all of the sudden,
you got that vibrant--

10:59.926 --> 11:01.228
What was that, Granny Smith?

11:01.261 --> 11:02.495
- Yes, it was Granny Smith.
- Yeah?

11:02.529 --> 11:03.963
And an apple, uh, crispy--

11:03.996 --> 11:06.032
( muttering )
I'm so nervous.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.167
- Are you okay?
- No! Oh, my God.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.903
I've never been up here
like this. Sorry, y'all.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.972
- ( laughs ) Sorry.
- Don't worry.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.409
Here's the thing.
It's not the prettiest,
but it's nice to see you

11:16.443 --> 11:18.678
cooking with confidence,
and I can taste that.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.013
- Good job. Well done.
- Thank you.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.682
Shanika, finally.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.817
I gave you an apron.
You're making me
so proud right now.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.886
Your eyes-- They--
They're amazing now.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.356
They look happy.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.758
The dish is great.

11:31.791 --> 11:34.327
It's so crispy on the outside.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.663
The rice is perfect.
The acidity in the apples

11:36.696 --> 11:39.666
and richness of the bacon makes
it a little bit more complex.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.268
It's really, really good.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.769
This is such
an evolution for you.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.271
- It is.
- To make a dish

11:44.304 --> 11:46.373
that has so much authentic
Italian flavor,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.275
- Thank you.
- so much technique.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.676
It's kind of perfect.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.211
- Make me proud. Good job.
- Thank you.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.413
Good job, girl!

11:56.983 --> 11:59.586
The second dish that we would
like to see examined further

11:59.619 --> 12:04.391
belongs to a cook who put
their heritage on the plate.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.327
The second dish belongs to...

12:09.762 --> 12:11.298
Come on up here, Ralph.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.900
- Yeah! Go, Ralph!
- Let's go, baby!

12:13.933 --> 12:15.268
Whoo!

12:15.302 --> 12:17.604
The judges
are taking notice of Ralph.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.038
I don't know how the hell
you miss me.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.940
I'm, like, the biggest dude
in the room.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.610
And I'm just excited
to really represent myself

12:23.643 --> 12:26.078
and the whole Filipino
culture in this plate.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.281
- Ralph, please describe
the dish.
- Yes, Chef.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.117
This is a fried chicken adobo
with, like, grated ginger,

12:31.150 --> 12:33.620
garlic, onions,
and soy sauce,

12:33.653 --> 12:36.489
served with an arborio
coconut curry rice.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.392
And then I used a little bit
of fried vermicelli
as a garnish.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.793
All right, so I came
to visit you.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.629
I saw the chicken
kind of searing there.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.397
- I got a little concerned.
- Yep.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.398
How did you kind of veer
and get that chicken cooked

12:45.432 --> 12:47.834
to such perfection?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.669
What I decided on was
I'm gonna braise this chicken

12:49.702 --> 12:53.072
with the adobo liquid
and then fry it.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.642
And when you fry it,
it's just gonna add
the finishing touches.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.010
So you didn't put anything
on the outside of the chicken?

12:58.044 --> 13:00.012
No. I was thinking
about doing flour,

13:00.046 --> 13:03.916
but I wanted to
let the actual skin
do the talking.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.352
I'm so happy that you decided
not to cover this in flour.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.286
It was smart move.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.088
The real adobo,

13:09.121 --> 13:11.458
that flavor from the soy,
all those aromatics--

13:11.491 --> 13:14.594
had you put flour,
I don't know if it would be
so prevalent on the palate.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.263
And then
the actual rice sucked in

13:17.296 --> 13:18.831
all of that
beautiful marinade.

13:18.865 --> 13:22.134
It's rich, it's fun
in a very unique Ralph way.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.671
- And I like it.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.477
Ralph, here's the thing.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.044
You've got the white meat
cooked beautifully.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.514
The skin and the flavor
of that is delicious.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.115
- It's a really good dish.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.950
It's a little sloppy.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.553
So get a bigger plate
and give yourself some room,

13:40.587 --> 13:41.988
and let your food breathe.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.790
But it really is packed
with flavor.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.392
- Thank you, Chef.
- Yeah. Good job.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.560
- Yeah, Ralph!
- Good job, Ralph!

13:48.928 --> 13:51.731
The third and final dish

13:51.764 --> 13:53.232
that really nailed it tonight

13:53.265 --> 13:55.802
belongs to our second cook
from Houston

13:55.835 --> 13:59.539
in the top three.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.008
Please bring up your dish...

14:02.041 --> 14:05.512
- Chelsea! Come on up.
- Nice job, Chelsea.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.246
I definitely think
I'm climbing towards the top.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.716
My dish shows finesse,
it shows skill,

14:09.749 --> 14:12.519
and I just think that
I'm gonna make Aarón so proud.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.086
So, Chelsea,
what's the dish?

14:14.120 --> 14:17.023
I did a goat cheese arancini

14:17.056 --> 14:19.526
with a beet salad
and a lemon vinaigrette.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.094
How is this dressed?
It's like a pesto almost.

14:22.128 --> 14:26.132
I did lemon juice, salt,
cherry vinegar, and olive oil.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.537
Goat cheese with beets
is a classic,

14:30.570 --> 14:34.340
and super full-flavored.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.743
And the outside crust
is super crispy.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.911
The one thing I have to say
is that these beets

14:38.945 --> 14:40.346
are maybe
a little undercooked.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.449
- Okay.
- But beautiful plating.
Good job.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.916
Thank you.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.458
Look, this arancini
is firing on all cylinders.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.560
It's a perfect example

14:53.593 --> 14:55.628
of two different kinds
of textures working
at the same time.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.765
Crispy on the outside
and creamy and rich,

14:58.798 --> 15:00.800
and unctuous on the inside.
That's what you want.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.536
- We have the perfect
fried item.
- Yes.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.605
This dish has
all the elements of something

15:05.638 --> 15:07.707
you wanna keep going back in
and having another bite.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.776
I'm proud
I gave you that apron.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.878
- You work in sales, correct?
- Yes.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.113
If you were selling me this
arancini at a restaurant,

15:14.146 --> 15:16.783
- I would buy a double order.
- Thank you.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.217
- Great job.
All three of you.
- Thank you.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.553
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.921
- Good job, Chels.
- Go, Chels.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.156
So proud of you.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.493
Chelsea:
Ralph's dish got really
bold flavors.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.595
Chicken was amazing.
Three different cuts.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.797
And Shanika's dish
looks delicious.

15:30.830 --> 15:31.931
...the flavor,
without a doubt.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.600
It's just we missed
the balance...

15:33.633 --> 15:35.568
But I think that mine looked
absolutely beautiful.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.136
It was composed,

15:37.169 --> 15:39.271
and it highlighted
the fried ingredient.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.674
I feel like I nailed this.
I deserve this win today.

15:41.708 --> 15:45.311
Shanika, Ralph, Chelsea,
well done, all three of you.

15:45.344 --> 15:46.579
But, unfortunately,

15:46.613 --> 15:49.415
we can only have
one mystery box winner,

15:49.448 --> 15:50.817
and know that winning this

15:50.850 --> 15:52.585
gives you a huge advantage

15:52.619 --> 15:54.320
in the next challenge.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.122
And the winner
of this challenge is...

16:06.065 --> 16:10.102
Unfortunately,
we can only have
one mystery box winner.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.337
And the winner
of this challenge is...

16:14.240 --> 16:15.542
Come on.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.843
...Shanika.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.213
- Good job!
- Good job, Shanika.
Great job.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.849
Shanika has finally arrived.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.317
I am getting the recognition
that I deserve.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.719
Go, Shanika.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.788
Ralph, Chelsea, good job.
Well done.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.023
- Thank you.
- Please head back to
your stations. Thank you.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.325
Y'all better watch out, 'cause
I told y'all I was coming.

16:33.359 --> 16:38.464
Shanika, you, of course,
are safe from elimination,

16:38.497 --> 16:42.201
and you'll get to watch this
daunting elimination challenge

16:42.234 --> 16:44.170
from the safety
of the balcony.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.239
But before you head upstairs,

16:47.273 --> 16:50.543
we're about to place this
competition in your hands.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.680
- Whew!
- You are not deciding

16:53.713 --> 16:55.514
what everybody's gonna be
cooking with tonight.

16:55.548 --> 16:59.051
- Okay.
- Because tonight
everyone will be cooking

16:59.085 --> 17:03.222
with the same incredible,
versatile ingredient.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.528
( squeals )

17:09.562 --> 17:12.331
Citrus fruits.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.501
Tonight, everybody will have to
incorporate citrus fruit

17:15.534 --> 17:17.904
- across their dishes.
- I'm so excited.

17:17.937 --> 17:21.040
When you grow up in a place
like Opa-Locka, Florida,

17:21.073 --> 17:24.677
with grapefruit trees and
orange trees in the backyard,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.846
they just become
a part of your DNA.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.748
Shanika,
you don't get to choose

17:28.781 --> 17:31.718
the ingredient
everyone has to cook with,

17:31.751 --> 17:34.286
but you will get to decide
what kind of dish

17:34.320 --> 17:36.923
each home cook
has to make this evening--

17:36.956 --> 17:38.958
savory or sweet.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.061
If Shanika hands you
a savory basket,

17:42.094 --> 17:44.897
that means you'll have
to make a savory dish.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.034
If Shanika hands you
a sweet basket,

17:48.067 --> 17:49.568
you'll have to make
a sweet dish.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.438
The home cook
who fails to conquer

17:52.471 --> 17:56.242
this citrus fruit challenge
will be going home.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.145
Please, everyone, line up.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.449
Gerron.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.754
Hey, Shanika.
Your ponytail looks good today.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.456
- Why thank you!
- ( laughing )

18:10.489 --> 18:13.626
I really would like
a sweet basket,

18:13.660 --> 18:17.596
because I didn't prove myself
in the last baking challenge.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.767
I will...

18:20.800 --> 18:23.770
not give you the opportunity
to correct that error,

18:23.803 --> 18:26.906
and I'm going to go with
the savory basket for you.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.808
Thank you so much.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.143
Gerron, is that
what you really wanted?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.145
This is exactly
what I really wanted.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.480
Gordon:
Smart boy.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.783
Shanika, they're playing
mind games with you.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.285
- I see that.
- Hey, girl.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.654
I would love
a sweet basket.

18:41.688 --> 18:45.257
I am going to give you
a savory basket

18:45.291 --> 18:47.093
- Damn it.
- to see what you can do.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.627
My strategy is very,
very direct.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.329
You will get this
sweet basket.

18:50.362 --> 18:52.164
Thank you.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.632
I've been paying attention to
everybody in this competition.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.501
The sweet basket.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.469
I'm giving the sweets
to the people

18:57.503 --> 18:59.005
that I know have issues
with baking.

18:59.038 --> 19:00.707
I'm gonna say pink basket.

19:00.740 --> 19:05.111
Well, of course I would not
give you the sweet basket.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.813
I do want the savory today.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.949
I am going to give you
the sweet basket today

19:09.982 --> 19:12.284
- Damn.
- to see what you can do.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.553
I'm just gonna go out now.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.522
They think
I don't notice things,
but I notice everything.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.125
Gordon:
Two talented cooks left.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.359
Wow.

19:20.392 --> 19:23.229
Sweet, savory.
Sweet, savory.

19:23.262 --> 19:27.033
- And you will get--
- Ooh, wow.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.201
sweet basket for you,
savory basket for you.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.636
- Farhan: Thanks, Shanika.
- Gordon: Wow.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.471
The end goal
is for me to get rid

19:32.504 --> 19:35.041
of top competitors right now.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.909
Emily, Cesar.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.577
Gordon:
Great choices.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.312
Now, head on up
to the balcony.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.248
If I can do that,

19:42.281 --> 19:45.051
that's one step closer to me
becoming the next MasterChef.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.086
Strategy is key.

19:49.756 --> 19:53.525
- Whew, okay.
- Oh, calamansi. I love you.

19:53.559 --> 19:54.894
- Can I grab something behind?
- Where the fruits at?

19:54.927 --> 19:56.829
There's a bunch
of lemons right here.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.330
Fennel, I need peas,
I need radishes.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.699
- Where's the dairy?
- Brussels, brussels, brussels.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.870
I got savory,
so I'm going to be making

20:03.903 --> 20:05.838
ravioli with
a lemon cream sauce.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.439
Some pine nuts over here.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.042
I feel like I'm starting
to fall behind

20:10.076 --> 20:12.578
- in the competition.
- ( bleep )

20:12.611 --> 20:15.081
I need to step it up
and prove to Gordon

20:15.114 --> 20:16.849
that I am here
for the long haul.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.250
Okay.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.219
- Let's go.
- Let's go, guys. Hurry up.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.889
Gordon: Well done, Cesar.
Ashley, are you kidding me?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.191
- I'm a grocery shopper, Chef.
- Oh, my Lord.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.060
Ashley brought the whole
grocery store out.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.697
Is everybody ready to cook
the most amazing citrus dish
of their lives?

20:31.730 --> 20:32.965
All:
Yes, Chef.

20:32.999 --> 20:36.268
60 minutes on the clock.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.505
Your time starts... now!

20:43.675 --> 20:46.813
Today, I'm gonna be stepping
out of my comfort zone.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.647
I'm making this
beautiful cube steak

20:48.680 --> 20:50.716
that has been marinating
in lime juice.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.484
I know I would be able
to succeed better

20:52.518 --> 20:54.320
at the sweet basket,

20:54.353 --> 20:56.088
but I think
I'm gonna surprise Shanika

20:56.122 --> 20:57.924
and pull off a great
savory dish today.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.426
Oh! Nice!

21:03.162 --> 21:05.331
Hey, Cesar,
what you making?

21:05.364 --> 21:07.599
I'm gonna be making
a lemon chiffon cake

21:07.633 --> 21:09.735
with mascarpone pecan filling.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.971
- Mmm!
- I'm from Houston,

21:12.004 --> 21:14.273
so in Texas we have lots
of pecan trees.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.608
So, it's a touch of home that
I'm putting in there as well.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.577
I think Shanika forgot
that the mystery box challenge

21:18.610 --> 21:21.747
that I have won
was with a baked item.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.583
So, assigning me
the sweet basket

21:24.616 --> 21:26.285
might not yield the results
that she was looking for.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.226
Let's just marvel
at the world of citrus.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.865
It's the most versatile
element in my kitchen.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.333
A lemon, an orange,
a grapefruit can really work

21:41.367 --> 21:43.202
in both sweet
and savory context.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.536
The citrus, it is the star.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.705
Gordon:
This is a tough challenge.

21:46.738 --> 21:49.341
We could be saying good-bye
to a big hitter tonight.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.943
Gerron:
Whoo!

21:50.977 --> 21:53.812
I took a study abroad trip
to Trinidad and Tobago

21:53.846 --> 21:56.548
where I ate a lot of jerk,
and so I am making

21:56.582 --> 21:59.385
a jerk chicken
infused with blood orange.

21:59.418 --> 22:01.020
Shanika definitely
underestimates me.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.122
I've been in elimination rounds
over and over again,

22:03.155 --> 22:05.224
but I make it out of elimination
every single time.

22:05.257 --> 22:08.094
So, I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling good.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.734
Guys, we're down
to 30 minutes remaining.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.836
- Joe: Let's go, guys.
Step it up.
- ( bleep ), man.

22:17.870 --> 22:21.673
Right, S.J.,
now Shanika gave
you a pink basket

22:21.707 --> 22:23.409
that you didn't want.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.577
- S.J.: Absolutely.
- It was strategy.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.179
Tell me what you're doing.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.714
So, I'm gonna be doing a
strawberry Meyer lemon torte.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.816
Why so complicated?
A torte, why?

22:30.849 --> 22:33.485
I've been taking a lot
of safe routes so far in
this competition, Chef.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.421
- And I really wanna step
out of my comfort zone.
- Right.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.223
- What are you layering it with?
- Strawberries
and whipped cream.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.258
The batter itself
has a little bit
of the Meyer lemon zest.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.327
- Nice.
- And I'm going to be doing
a butter cream frosting

22:41.360 --> 22:44.163
that's gonna have a little bit
of the juice itself

22:44.196 --> 22:45.697
- and the depth from
the Meyer lemon as well.
- Right.

22:45.731 --> 22:47.733
You may be one
of the youngest here,

22:47.766 --> 22:49.768
but you are a very
passionate young man.

22:49.801 --> 22:52.871
- Thank you, Chef.
- Focus and don't
leave everything

22:52.905 --> 22:54.406
- to the last minute.
- Yes, Chef.

22:56.742 --> 22:59.345
Okay, Emily,
what are you thinking?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.613
Chile lime marinated shrimp

23:01.647 --> 23:04.083
over a kind of an jilotes
inspirited corn salad

23:04.116 --> 23:05.717
with an avocado lime crema.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.686
- When you got
the savory basket,
- Yes.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.523
did you feel like Shanika
is playing some strategy
against you?

23:11.557 --> 23:13.225
I know that Shanika
wants me to go home.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.227
- I'm just motivating you.
- She sees me as a threat

23:15.261 --> 23:18.197
because I am one of
the strongest competitors
in the kitchen.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.566
But this is not something
that is in my wheelhouse.

23:20.599 --> 23:23.569
Like, I think the savory
is gonna test my skills today.

23:23.602 --> 23:24.971
Emily, good luck.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.006
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.278
Ashley, Shanika gave you
a dessert basket.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.213
- Yes, she did, Chef.
- What are you making?

23:34.246 --> 23:37.383
I am doing a double layer
lemon blueberry cake.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.717
It's gonna have
a lemon curd.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.652
I'm going for
a coconut pastry cream.

23:40.686 --> 23:42.088
- Wow.
- And it's gonna have
beautiful garnishes

23:42.121 --> 23:44.957
of these lime zest cookies.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.825
Like, this is gonna be
to honor my grandparents.

23:46.858 --> 23:48.494
This is gonna be to honor
Opa-Locka and my family.

23:48.527 --> 23:51.263
And I have to do it.
There's no, like,
letting them down.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.999
I can't believe you're
gonna do this in 60 minutes,

23:53.032 --> 23:54.800
- I'm gonna do it.
- but I'm gonna wish you
all the best.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.502
- Thank you, Chef. Thank you.
- Good luck, Ashley.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.170
What in the hell
is she doing?

24:02.541 --> 24:04.110
- How's it going, Chef?
- All right, Ralph, talk to me.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.312
- What are you making?
- It's brazo de mercedes.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.280
This is, like,
a special cake that my mom
always makes for us.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.516
So, I'm very honored
to be doing this dish.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.684
You got Joe's pin
on your apron.

24:12.718 --> 24:16.655
Should he be concerned
that Shanika chose
a sweet basket for you?

24:16.688 --> 24:18.924
Bake that cake.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.527
I've never baked
in the competition,
so I gotta make sure--

24:21.560 --> 24:24.696
this dish has a couple--
oh, we got--

24:24.730 --> 24:27.133
- Ralph, Ralph, don't BS us.
- Yes, Chef?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.601
You're sweating like
a long-tailed cat
in a rocking chair store.

24:29.635 --> 24:33.372
You can't just talk the talk.
You gotta walk the walk.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.873
I don't wanna
lose another apron, bro.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.908
Oh, my God.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.153
- How's it going, Chef?
- All right, Ralph, you got
Joe's pin on your apron.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.954
Should he be concerned

24:48.987 --> 24:51.290
that Shanika chose
a sweet basket for you?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.859
Bake that cake.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.362
I've never baked
in the competition,
so I gotta make sure--

24:56.395 --> 24:59.365
this dish has a couple--
oh, we got--

24:59.398 --> 25:01.733
- Ralph, Ralph, don't BS us.
- Yes, Chef?

25:01.767 --> 25:05.204
You can't just talk the talk.
You gotta walk the walk.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.638
I don't wanna
lose another apron, bro.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.740
- I got you, Joe. Thank you.
- Good luck.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.245
All right,
if that doesn't work,
you need a backup plan.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.314
Wow. First of all, Ashley,

25:15.347 --> 25:17.516
I mean, she's doing, like,
a three-layer cake

25:17.549 --> 25:19.585
- with a coconut
citrus filling.
- Ooh, it's hot.

25:19.618 --> 25:20.919
S.J., again, another dessert.

25:20.952 --> 25:22.754
He's doing this citrus torte

25:22.788 --> 25:24.356
with, like,
a strawberry filling.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.758
So, two very tough
desserts to pull off,

25:26.792 --> 25:28.694
and I don't think
they're gonna have time
to nail it.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.796
I am, like, sweating.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.667
- Damn it.
- Hey, Gordon,

25:35.701 --> 25:37.103
are you prepared to lose one
of your aprons tonight?

25:37.136 --> 25:39.738
- No.
- I'm talking about Taylor.

25:39.771 --> 25:42.774
She's making a ravioli filled
with ricotta and spinach.

25:42.808 --> 25:45.177
She's gonna do
a very run of the mill
lemon cream sauce.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.513
Joe:
Quit those lemon
cream sauces.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.215
- It's not 1975.
- Exactly.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.917
We are coming up
to two minutes remaining.

25:51.950 --> 25:54.220
Joe:
Let's go, guys.
Step it up.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.888
- Okay.
- I don't think
Ashley can make it.

25:56.922 --> 25:58.790
Joe:
She has to construct
the cake.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.359
- Yeah.
- Those layers are still hot.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.428
It's gonna squish out
like melted butter.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.397
- S.J., you gotta go.
- Yes, Chef. Oh!

26:05.431 --> 26:06.765
Joe:
Another layer?

26:06.798 --> 26:08.634
Another layer.
Really?

26:08.667 --> 26:10.736
30 seconds remaining!

26:10.769 --> 26:12.871
Joe:
Ralph is getting
his custard out.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.640
Oh, my God.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.909
Ralph's plate right now looks
like a bowl of English mustard.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.979
- Aarón: Let's go, Ralph!
- Joe: Come on,
you got my apron!

26:21.012 --> 26:23.915
- That is not pretty.
- Whoa.

26:27.018 --> 26:30.589
- Here we go.
- Ten, nine, eight,

26:30.622 --> 26:34.993
seven, six, five, four,

26:35.026 --> 26:38.063
three, two, one.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.431
- And stop!
- That's it. Hands in the air.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.899
- Whoo!
- Wow!

26:40.932 --> 26:43.835
- Wow.
- Damn.

26:43.869 --> 26:48.474
Now it's time to find out
how you all did using citrus.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.976
First up, Gerron.

26:51.009 --> 26:54.180
Since day one,
I've been working
on my plating,

26:54.213 --> 26:57.516
and I'm feeling pretty
confident about
what I have here.

26:57.549 --> 27:00.486
But the MasterChef kitchen is
always full of surprises.

27:00.519 --> 27:01.987
You can be knocked down
really quick.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.655
Aarón:
So, how would you
describe the dish?

27:03.689 --> 27:07.493
It is a jerk chicken infused
with blood orange zest,

27:07.526 --> 27:10.296
and then also a coconut
cauliflower puree

27:10.329 --> 27:12.364
with crispy bacon
and brussels.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.700
You put coconut
in cauliflower?

27:14.733 --> 27:18.103
Yeah, I actually boiled it
in coconut milk.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.539
I lived in Trinidad
for a month on study abroad

27:20.572 --> 27:22.841
and I ate a lot
of jerk chicken there,

27:22.874 --> 27:25.110
and just experienced
a lot of island flavors,

27:25.143 --> 27:26.945
and so that was just
my inspiration tonight.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.714
Well, I'm happy
that you spent time
in Trinidad

27:28.747 --> 27:30.216
and understand
those flavors.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.519
You chose
to serve the breast.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.120
You were able to inject
a lot of flavor

27:35.153 --> 27:36.388
in that marinade
and the jerk

27:36.422 --> 27:37.823
in a very short
period of time.

27:37.856 --> 27:40.492
I love the velvet nature
and the creativity

27:40.526 --> 27:42.494
of coconut and cauliflower.

27:42.528 --> 27:43.729
What would I
have done different?

27:43.762 --> 27:45.364
Herbs.
This needs some freshness.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.133
But, look, man,
this is really showing

27:48.166 --> 27:50.135
that you're growing
as a cook, Gerron.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.638
- Very impressive.
- Thank you, Chef.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.673
Next up, Ralph.

27:54.706 --> 27:56.542
( bleep )

27:56.575 --> 27:58.210
Ralph:
I am so shook right now.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.746
This plate does not
look good at all.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.714
I don't know what
the judges are gonna say.

28:02.748 --> 28:05.150
I just hope that it tastes
absolutely amazing.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.153
So, explain
the dish to me.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.521
It's a brazo de mercedes,

28:09.555 --> 28:12.324
with a mixed berry
calamansi coulis.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.493
And it's supposed to be,
like, a rolled dessert.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.728
Yes.
I think the time got to me.

28:16.762 --> 28:19.898
This is a dish that usually
takes two hours to make.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.671
You chose to do
a very ambitious thing,

28:25.704 --> 28:29.174
but the meringue is
kind of technically wrong.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.243
I mean, it tastes more like
a marshmallow than a meringue.

28:33.412 --> 28:36.382
This dish is a--
I don't even know
what to say.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.584
It's chewy.
It's raw in the middle.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.387
It's doughy.
This is a couple
of ingredients

28:41.420 --> 28:44.122
put together and assembled
in a sloppy mess.

28:44.155 --> 28:47.025
- Oh, man.
- You know, Ralph,

28:47.058 --> 28:48.960
it's been a great road
for you and I.

28:48.994 --> 28:53.265
I gave you an apron,
and I would hate for it
to end on this.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.966
- Yes, Joe.
- Thank you.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.034
Thank you.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.637
I am devastated right now.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.306
I hope the judges
see the potential in me.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.107
I hope they see
that I've been growing,

29:02.140 --> 29:03.975
I've been learning,
and, uh,

29:04.009 --> 29:05.444
hope this isn't
the end of the road.

29:07.846 --> 29:10.916
Next up, Ashley, please.
Thank you.

29:10.949 --> 29:14.820
I have never made a cake
in 60 minutes before,

29:14.853 --> 29:17.222
but it looks gorgeous.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.592
However, I am still nervous,

29:20.626 --> 29:22.994
because my daddy always says,

29:23.028 --> 29:25.664
- "But does it taste good?"
- You live on the edge.

29:25.697 --> 29:29.768
With two minutes to go,
you're assembling this.

29:29.801 --> 29:31.637
Are you crazy?

29:31.670 --> 29:34.473
Yes, I'm crazy.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.975
Gordon:
And describe it.
What is it?

29:37.008 --> 29:39.911
This is a lemon cake,

29:39.945 --> 29:42.781
filled with lemon curd,
a blueberry sauce,

29:42.814 --> 29:46.084
with lime zest and
white chocolate whipped cream.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.186
What's the sponge?

29:48.219 --> 29:49.988
It's a classic lemon cake,

29:50.021 --> 29:52.424
and it has
the freshly-squeezed
lemon juice

29:52.458 --> 29:55.260
and fresh lemon zest inside.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.429
Ooh.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.465
It looks
like it just came out

29:59.498 --> 30:01.700
of a top patisserie shop
off the Champs-Elysées.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.470
I hope it tastes
as good as it looks.

30:04.503 --> 30:05.871
What's in the chantilly?

30:05.904 --> 30:08.039
It's heavy cream
that's been whipped,

30:08.073 --> 30:09.608
and then also
some white chocolate

30:09.641 --> 30:11.543
that I melted down
for the sweetness

30:11.577 --> 30:13.211
instead of powdered sugar.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.284
I'm gonna be honest.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.318
Um...

30:33.331 --> 30:35.467
I'm gonna be honest.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.903
Um...

30:37.936 --> 30:40.205
- it's bloody delicious!
- Oh!

30:40.238 --> 30:42.007
The sponge is magical.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.875
I think you've got
five or six different flavors

30:43.909 --> 30:45.877
of the citrus
bouncing around
on the palate.

30:45.911 --> 30:51.182
The curd is vibrant,
tangy, sour, sweet, bitter.

30:51.216 --> 30:53.084
Young lady, I think this
is the best performance

30:53.118 --> 30:55.353
that you've had in
this competition so far

30:55.387 --> 30:56.988
because you played
to your strengths.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.690
You took a massive risk,
and it paid off.

30:58.724 --> 31:01.427
I'm happy for you,
and I'm worried

31:01.460 --> 31:04.195
for everybody else
standing behind you.

31:04.229 --> 31:05.731
- Thank you, Chef.
- Good job, girl.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.299
- Whoo! Go, Ashley.
- Good job, Ashley.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.538
Next up, Cesar.

31:14.473 --> 31:18.009
Shanika, there's no way
I'm going home tonight.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.111
I'm extremely happy
with my dish,

31:20.145 --> 31:23.214
so I know I'm gonna
make Chef Aarón very proud.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.617
All right, so,
before I taste
this dish, Cesar,

31:25.651 --> 31:28.019
Shanika, what is
your assessment of
this dessert?

31:28.053 --> 31:32.958
Um, I'll be bluntly honest.
It doesn't look appealing.

31:32.991 --> 31:34.626
Shanika, you are absolutely
right about that.

31:34.660 --> 31:38.296
This looks like it's
a slice from a bigger cake

31:38.329 --> 31:40.298
that was left behind
somewhere.

31:40.331 --> 31:42.133
Talk to me about your dish.

31:42.167 --> 31:43.902
It's a lemon chiffon cake,

31:43.935 --> 31:45.971
with a pecan and mascarpone
filling in the middle,

31:46.004 --> 31:47.939
and just
whipped cream on top.

31:47.973 --> 31:50.241
So what citrus
did you rally around?

31:50.275 --> 31:53.579
I put lemon zest
and lemon juice in the batter,

31:53.612 --> 31:56.715
and then I made a kumquat
and grapefruit simple syrup

31:56.748 --> 31:58.750
to soak it
before I assembled it.

32:01.419 --> 32:05.591
Here's the deal.
It's unappealing.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.627
This is a very...
( sighs )

32:08.660 --> 32:11.296
...difficult dessert,
because, surprisingly,

32:11.329 --> 32:14.165
I can't even pick up
any citrus.

32:14.199 --> 32:17.969
And it's not lively
and popping in my palate.

32:18.003 --> 32:20.138
All of the elements
that you've chose to put on,

32:20.171 --> 32:24.510
from the cream to the pecans,
they're not that bad,

32:24.543 --> 32:27.613
but it's just like
a cake that you would
get from a diner.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.916
I gave you my apron.
I believe that you're gonna be,

32:30.949 --> 32:34.085
hopefully, a chef someday
that can take Mexican food
to the next level,

32:34.119 --> 32:36.555
but that right there
is a disappointment.

32:38.456 --> 32:42.160
Cesar: As a teacher,
I always tell my students

32:42.193 --> 32:43.529
to perform their best,

32:43.562 --> 32:46.264
and tonight, obviously,
I did not do that.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.034
So, Shanika,
well-played tonight.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.336
I'm feeling
this could be the moment

32:51.369 --> 32:52.704
that this dream ends.

32:52.738 --> 32:56.374
Next, please join us,
Samantha.

32:56.407 --> 32:58.677
Samantha:
This dish is really outside
of my comfort zone.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.812
I don't work with steak a lot,

33:00.846 --> 33:02.280
because being in college,

33:02.313 --> 33:03.549
steak is not
on the budget for me.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.450
But I feel so confident,

33:05.483 --> 33:07.185
and I know I knocked it
out of the park.

33:07.218 --> 33:09.287
Okay, Samantha,
tell me about the dish.

33:09.320 --> 33:13.458
Today, I have for you
a lime juice marinated steak

33:13.491 --> 33:16.962
on a bed of roasted red,
yellow, and green bell peppers,

33:16.995 --> 33:20.666
and then I have a chimichurri
and lime and cilantro crema.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.233
And what cut of steak
did you use?

33:22.267 --> 33:24.135
I believe
it was a cube steak.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.170
Mmm.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.306
You know,
the chimichurri's good.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.908
It has, probably more
than any other dish,

33:29.941 --> 33:31.342
a strong citrus component

33:31.376 --> 33:33.478
in all the aspects of it.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.581
Steak's properly cooked.
Nice sear on the outside.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.049
The peppers are really,
actually, properly cooked,

33:38.083 --> 33:40.218
which is always something
that's very difficult to do.

33:40.251 --> 33:42.053
- Good job, Samantha.
- Thank you.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.355
Emily, thank you.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.926
Emily,
describe the dish, please.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.762
It's a chile lime shrimp

33:50.796 --> 33:53.098
over an jilote-inspired
corn salad

33:53.131 --> 33:55.601
with an avocado-lime crema.

33:55.634 --> 33:59.104
I used lime and lemon,
lemon to focus on
the corn salad,

33:59.137 --> 34:01.039
and lime in the shrimp
and the crema.

34:03.274 --> 34:07.512
What you've done is
you've brought out
that magic of the citrus.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.948
That's what
we were hoping for.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.183
The big surprise is
when you get so much color
on a shrimp like that,

34:12.217 --> 34:14.385
and they're still cooked
beautifully in the center,

34:14.419 --> 34:17.455
and seasoning on point,
that shows me you've
got finesse.

34:17.488 --> 34:20.726
It's a rustic dish,
but it's got that
nice bold flavor.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.595
Shanika targeted you tonight.
I think it's a missed hit.

34:23.629 --> 34:27.398
- Well done.
- Next up, Taylor.

34:29.434 --> 34:33.939
I made a ravioli
stuffed with pine nuts,

34:33.972 --> 34:35.941
ricotta cheese,
some Parmesan,

34:35.974 --> 34:38.644
with a lemon cream sauce
underneath.

34:41.146 --> 34:42.480
Let me tell you something,
young lady.

34:42.513 --> 34:45.083
It has delivered
on flavor, texture.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.885
Little bit more cream sauce.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.787
You need that one element,
that condimenti,

34:48.820 --> 34:50.656
to kind of
bring it all together.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.057
But the citrus pop at the end

34:52.090 --> 34:54.660
really makes this dish
remarkable.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.963
- Thank you, Chef.
- Good job.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.967
Next up, S.J., please.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.302
I know that my torte
doesn't look pretty,

35:04.335 --> 35:06.071
but I hope
that the judges see

35:06.104 --> 35:07.605
that I tried my best,

35:07.639 --> 35:09.975
and that I can pair
citrus ingredients

35:10.008 --> 35:11.977
with any dish,
sweet or savory.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.079
S.J.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.614
O-M-G.

35:16.648 --> 35:21.319
- What is that?
- Um...

35:23.221 --> 35:25.123
Gordon:
I'm looking at that.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.460
I don't know what to say!

35:29.494 --> 35:31.162
Describe the dish.

35:31.196 --> 35:34.332
It is a strawberry
Meyer lemon torte.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.935
The center is strawberries
that's been marinated

35:36.968 --> 35:38.704
with the Meyer lemon juice,

35:38.737 --> 35:40.672
and a little bit
of the zest as well.

35:42.173 --> 35:43.408
( sighs )

35:48.714 --> 35:50.081
You know it's not good, right?

35:53.685 --> 35:55.553
There's no citrus in there.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.155
And seriously?

35:57.188 --> 35:58.957
- What's that?
- Uh, caramel, Chef.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.693
( bleep )
It's a visit to the dentist.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.631
Have we seen everything?
Are you done?

36:06.664 --> 36:07.866
Is it time to get back
to studies?

36:07.899 --> 36:09.634
No, Chef.
I really want to be here.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.738
This is one of
my biggest embarrassments

36:12.771 --> 36:14.639
and disappointments
ever in cooking.

36:14.672 --> 36:15.673
I really want to bounce back
from this, Chef.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.475
Bounce back?

36:17.508 --> 36:20.511
Yeah, I'd love you to
progress in this competition,

36:20.545 --> 36:22.080
but how can I invest in that?

36:22.113 --> 36:24.049
Would you invest in that?

36:24.082 --> 36:26.184
- No, Chef.
- No.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.587
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.023
I'm so down on myself
right now.

36:32.057 --> 36:36.261
The fact that I served
something of this poor quality

36:36.294 --> 36:39.064
to Gordon Ramsay,
who gave me one of his aprons,

36:39.097 --> 36:41.099
is just heart-wrenching.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.567
I could be going home.

36:49.440 --> 36:53.178
Now, guys, that was
a very tough challenge.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.582
There were two outstanding
dishes tonight,

36:57.615 --> 37:00.385
and it just so happens
that one was savory
and one was sweet.

37:00.418 --> 37:02.620
Gerron and...

37:02.653 --> 37:04.689
- Ashley.
- Gerron: Thank you.

37:04.722 --> 37:05.924
Aarón:
Great job, young lady.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.294
- Thank you.
- Gordon: Amazing.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.729
But now comes
the hard part.

37:11.763 --> 37:15.333
If we call your name,
please come down
to the front.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.736
S.J.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.139
Cesar.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.141
Ralph.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.447
One of you is going home.

37:33.518 --> 37:38.089
Cesar,
you got a lot of things
wrong tonight.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.561
But there were two
worse dishes than yours.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.463
Please, head back
to your station.

37:45.496 --> 37:48.066
It's a great relief
to know that I'm safe,

37:48.099 --> 37:49.667
that I'm part of the top 12,

37:49.700 --> 37:52.470
but I know if I keep
performing like this,

37:52.503 --> 37:53.939
my name is next.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.941
You live to fight
another battle.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.943
So I really need
to buckle down

37:57.976 --> 38:00.078
and elevate what I'm doing
in this kitchen.

38:00.111 --> 38:05.783
So, it's down
to S.J. and Ralph.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.253
S.J., you were brought
into this competition

38:08.286 --> 38:10.922
by Chef Gordon Ramsay.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.191
And, Ralph, you were brought
into this competition

38:13.224 --> 38:14.759
by Joe Bastianich.

38:14.792 --> 38:18.263
Both of you
fell from a great height

38:18.296 --> 38:19.564
with dessert.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.502
Gordon,
who would you send home?

38:24.535 --> 38:27.873
Um, S.J.,
you just took on too much.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.942
Ralph, you didn't
give yourself enough time

38:30.976 --> 38:32.743
to master that dessert.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.948
So, I would send home Ralph.

38:36.982 --> 38:37.983
Aarón:
Wow.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.652
- Joe?
- It's tough.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.788
Aarón: Yeah.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.057
The home cook
that I would send home,

38:46.091 --> 38:49.394
didn't have
the technical skills
to execute,

38:49.427 --> 38:53.164
is wearing an apron
that I gave him.

38:53.198 --> 38:57.568
- I'm sorry, Ralph.
- Wow.

38:57.602 --> 39:00.838
I agree with
both Gordon and Joe.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.740
Ralph, this is
the end of the road.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.742
Thank you, Chef.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.679
S.J., get back
to your station, please.

39:16.254 --> 39:18.256
Ralph, you know,

39:18.289 --> 39:21.226
even though you and I
have become friends,

39:21.259 --> 39:23.528
I have to deal you
this devastating blow

39:23.561 --> 39:26.431
in order for us to pursue

39:26.464 --> 39:29.234
our mission to find
America's next MasterChef,

39:29.267 --> 39:31.402
and I'm sorry
for that, Ralph.

39:31.436 --> 39:32.670
My love to everybody.
Thank you to the judges,

39:32.703 --> 39:35.706
and, uh,
I've learned so much.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.208
Ralph...

39:37.242 --> 39:39.210
please place your apron
on your bench,

39:39.244 --> 39:40.245
and goodnight.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.049
One more thing.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.684
- Come on, brother.
- Bring it in, Joe.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.886
- ( applause )
- Good job.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.858
I'm very sad to be leaving
the MasterChef kitchen,

39:53.891 --> 39:56.461
but I feel like
I've accomplished a lot
since I've been here.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.263
I've learned so much,

39:58.296 --> 40:01.366
and I'm not going to
give up on my dream

40:01.399 --> 40:03.101
of starting
a Filipino restaurant.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.235
Thanks, guys.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.937
Shout-out to those judges.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.072
Shout-out to my mentor, Joe.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.739
I got a little misty there.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.542
Not only am I a better person,
but I'm a better cook.

40:11.576 --> 40:12.944
Bye!

40:19.985 --> 40:21.386
And just like that,

40:21.419 --> 40:24.889
we entered with 24,

40:24.922 --> 40:26.958
we're down to the top 12.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.327
Shanika:
Oh! This hurts,

40:29.360 --> 40:32.930
'cause I was the cause of us
losing our apron.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.599
We're down
to three aprons now.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.901
Aarón has four,

40:36.934 --> 40:38.769
and Gordon still has five?

40:38.803 --> 40:41.472
This competition
is getting serious now.

40:41.506 --> 40:44.609
Now, all of you,
get some rest.

40:44.642 --> 40:46.944
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Chef.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.152
Narrator:
Next time on "MasterChef"...

40:55.320 --> 40:56.988
Halibut.

40:57.022 --> 40:59.157
...it's a Gordon Ramsay
master class.

40:59.190 --> 41:03.094
The way Gordon's moving,
it's just like a surgeon
at work.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.529
- And...
- Damn it.

41:04.562 --> 41:06.097
only the sharpest
home cooks...

41:06.131 --> 41:08.099
Gordon: Looks like
it's been mauled by a cat.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.767
- ...will make the cut.
- This looks like

41:09.800 --> 41:11.169
trying to clean a fish
with an ax.

41:11.202 --> 41:12.837
Then, a shocking twist...

41:12.870 --> 41:16.274
Two more talented cooks
will be leaving.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.209
...shakes up
the MasterChef kitchen.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.478
And that will happen
right now.
