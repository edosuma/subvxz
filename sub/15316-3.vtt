WEBVTT

00:08.241 --> 00:10.476
I said, are you sure this is it?

00:10.477 --> 00:13.112
Keep your voice down!
We're trying to remain undetected.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.881
That does require a modicum
of silence.

00:15.882 --> 00:16.932
Modicum. Right.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.381
Why are we hiding?

00:20.086 --> 00:22.521
We're on an island
in the middle of nowhere.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.390
And it's a crypt, not the Pentagon.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.458
A crypt potentially
containing an elixir

00:26.459 --> 00:29.194
capable of prolonging life
for centuries.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.945
Such secrets are rarely left
unguarded.

00:31.998 --> 00:34.848
- Yeah, but why can't we just -
- Look.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.282 --> 00:53.185
Keepers of the dead.
Best to be avoided if at all possible.

00:53.186 --> 00:53.646
Right.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.045
I got "I'm going in"
and "go around,"

01:08.101 --> 01:09.635
but what was
that wiggly one you did?

01:09.636 --> 01:12.076
Either we work together or we die.

01:13.006 --> 01:13.746
Let's go.

01:15.442 --> 01:15.842
Okay.

01:30.056 --> 01:32.591
Take the other side.
Draw them away if you can.

01:32.592 --> 01:36.222
- You're kidding, right?
- Go quickly, before they -

01:37.497 --> 01:38.017
Ashley?

02:05.792 --> 02:08.872
Okay, I know this was not
on the brochure!

02:09.696 --> 02:11.763
This is why we
don't work with Sylvio.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.924
His intel is hopeless!
Ashley!

02:17.837 --> 02:19.337
Go to the crypt! Go!

02:20.773 --> 02:21.113
Mom!

03:16.062 --> 03:17.092
I'm going in!

03:23.937 --> 03:24.337
Will!

03:28.708 --> 03:30.108
This might be my first crypt,

03:30.109 --> 03:33.369
but aren't they supposed
to hold dead people?

04:28.868 --> 04:30.335
Are you sure about this?

04:30.336 --> 04:33.639
I mean, I could go with you,
or maybe you could take -

04:33.640 --> 04:34.740
Take the big guy?

04:34.741 --> 04:38.921
Mom, come on, it's a clean-up job,
not a major operation.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.925
I'll be fine on my own.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.449
A humanoid chameleon living under
the city is hardly a clean-up job.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.351
- It's more of a -
- Problem. Yeah.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.486
Our kind of problem.

04:47.487 --> 04:50.355
One we should have taken care
of before we went to Scotland.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.726
I can handle it.
You got your hands full here.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.327
Do you have everything
you need?

04:55.328 --> 04:56.018
Uh, yeah.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.696
Henry wants me to field-test
some new stuff.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.553
And, uh, hey, if the gear fails,

05:02.769 --> 05:05.679
I'll just use the patented
Magnus charm.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.265
Right.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.250
Well, I just wanted to connect.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.077
You know,
we rarely get the chance.

05:12.078 --> 05:12.828
Aw, Mom...

05:14.347 --> 05:15.397
Alrighty, then.

05:15.748 --> 05:19.268
One nasty chameleon
subterranean menace going down.

05:19.619 --> 05:20.849
- Ashley?
- Yeah?

05:21.954 --> 05:22.764
Be careful.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.127
Always, Mom.

05:26.459 --> 05:27.089
See 'ya.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.780
Three not-so-dead women
found in coffins.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.715
Just another day at the office.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.346
All three are comatose.

05:51.751 --> 05:55.654
Fortunately, brain functions
and vital organs seem to be intact.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.557
- So they're normal?
- Near as I can tell.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.992
The scans aren't detecting
any physical anomalies,

06:00.993 --> 06:03.295
but they can only tell us so much.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.764
I'm administering
a time-released stimulant.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.766
It should bring them back
to consciousness slowly,

06:07.767 --> 06:10.807
with as little physical
trauma as possible.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.704
What about emotional trauma?

06:12.705 --> 06:15.340
That's more your department,
I should think.

06:15.341 --> 06:16.621
Until they awaken,

06:16.843 --> 06:19.945
we have to rely on more
traditional forensic methods.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.286
Now, this fellow...

06:24.851 --> 06:25.841
Fond memories.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.154
These creatures
detected our presence early

06:29.155 --> 06:32.145
and possessed unnatural
speed and strength.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.913
Definitely not normal.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.188
Not as you would define it, no.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.607
I was about to gather
some fluid samples.

06:48.608 --> 06:49.708
Care to assist?

06:51.043 --> 06:52.773
Uh, I'd love to, but...

06:55.515 --> 06:56.782
I'd better get back to my office

06:56.783 --> 07:00.318
and get the whole head-shrinking
operation up and running.

07:00.319 --> 07:01.239
As you wish.

07:33.853 --> 07:34.133
No!

07:44.864 --> 07:45.144
Hi.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.309
It's nice to see
you're finally awake.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.238
I'm Dr. Zimmerman.
Will.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.978
Can you understand
anything I'm saying?

08:03.816 --> 08:04.966
Hey, it's okay.

08:05.718 --> 08:09.248
It's okay. You're okay.
You're in a safe place.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.469
Okay, okay.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.805
You're in a safe place.
Just relax.

08:29.842 --> 08:30.182
I...

08:34.313 --> 08:35.123
...am Danu.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.126
So you can talk.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.592
My sisters, Tatha and Caird...
Are they...?

08:46.325 --> 08:48.493
They're fine.
Your sisters are fine.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.174
You just woke up first.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.091
You're in a medical facility.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.205
We brought you here
after we found you in a...

09:00.206 --> 09:01.196
...dark place.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.794
Do you have any idea
how you ended up there?

09:10.049 --> 09:10.869
Creatures...

09:12.818 --> 09:14.618
They came to our village.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.080
They weren't human.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.146
Yeah, sounds familiar.

09:24.530 --> 09:27.090
They took us with them,
and then...

09:30.770 --> 09:32.100
...I woke up here.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.473
Your village...
Is there anyone there?

09:35.474 --> 09:38.109
Your friends or family
that we can contact?

09:38.110 --> 09:41.279
- Let them know you're alright?
- I'm sorry, I just...

09:41.280 --> 09:42.550
I can't remember.

09:43.282 --> 09:46.302
Well, it's okay.
You just take your time.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.523
This place...

09:54.727 --> 09:55.647
It's like...

09:58.230 --> 10:00.560
...nothing I've ever seen before.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.699
There's... There's light,
but I see no candles.

10:09.508 --> 10:13.058
There's warmth,
but there's no fire, no sunlight.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.757
Danu, before you and your sisters
were taken,

10:17.883 --> 10:19.683
how much do you remember?

10:22.555 --> 10:23.535
At last mass,

10:26.258 --> 10:29.761
we were mourning the loss
of our priest to the miasmas.

10:29.762 --> 10:30.632
The miasmas?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.797
It's a sickness
that has cursed

10:32.798 --> 10:36.018
many villages surrounding us
in recent months.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.540
There is no cure.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.785
So you remember the miasmas.

10:43.776 --> 10:44.766
Anything else?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.709
Why can't I remember?

10:54.186 --> 10:55.516
Just give it time.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.827
These creatures exhibit
a terrifying propensity for violence.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.518
Physiology appears human
in base form,

11:05.898 --> 11:08.333
though significant anomalies
to the face and torso

11:08.334 --> 11:12.604
indicate the possibility of mutation
at a base genetic level.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.673
Ugh. Okay, you need to...

11:17.209 --> 11:22.089
You need to put a sock on the door
or something before you do that.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.578
He's breathtaking, isn't he?

11:25.418 --> 11:27.968
Yeah, that's one way of putting it.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.987
How are our guests doing?

11:31.090 --> 11:34.170
Confused. At least the one
who's awake is.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.996
She mentioned a disease that
was killing people in her village,

11:37.997 --> 11:39.457
called the "miasmas,"

11:40.299 --> 11:43.168
which translates from the Greek
meaning "poisoned air. "

11:43.169 --> 11:44.339
Plague, actually.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.260
The bubonic plague,
specifically.

11:47.940 --> 11:52.210
However, the last reported serious
outbreak was in Scotland in...

11:52.211 --> 11:53.071
...800 A.D.

11:53.379 --> 11:53.959
Meaning?

11:54.580 --> 11:55.500
She's crazy.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.355
Is that your professional opinion?

11:58.684 --> 11:59.818
Look, I know there's a lot of things

11:59.819 --> 12:02.320
that are outside the realm
of our knowledge, blah blah blah.

12:02.321 --> 12:05.290
But logically,
if she were from 800 A.D.,

12:05.291 --> 12:07.826
she wouldn't speak English
the way we do.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.861
I'm guessing
that linguistics and grammar

12:09.862 --> 12:11.863
have evolved somewhat
since then.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.598
- Some would say "devolved. "
Whatever.

12:13.599 --> 12:15.633
The point is
that we wouldn't understand her.

12:15.634 --> 12:19.314
Which makes her a very sweet,
very delusional woman.

12:19.605 --> 12:20.245
Possibly.

12:21.273 --> 12:24.909
If you have a theory,
please, share it with the class.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.578
The liquid we found
the three of them in

12:26.579 --> 12:29.748
bears similar chemical properties
to suspended animation formulae

12:29.749 --> 12:31.849
used by southern voodoo cults.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.622
The human body cannot survive
intact for 1,200 years.

12:37.623 --> 12:40.458
I don't care what kind
of magic bath products you use.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.379
And I agree.

12:41.727 --> 12:45.517
So, these women are
either far more than they appear,

12:45.531 --> 12:48.811
or, to use your incredibly
clever vernacular...

12:48.934 --> 12:49.394
Crazy.

12:50.302 --> 12:52.170
The question
we should be asking...

12:52.171 --> 12:54.305
...is why the keepers
were so anxious

12:54.306 --> 12:56.841
to stop us from getting
into that crypt.

12:56.842 --> 13:01.312
What is it about these women
that they don't want us to know?

13:35.481 --> 13:37.782
We've got evidence of two
women and a man out here,

13:37.783 --> 13:40.793
and a hell of a lot
of 45 mm cartridges.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.101
Round up the keepers.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.776
Mobilize alpha team
for a priority one retrieval.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.260
Whoever took our property
is going to pay.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.164
Piece of cake.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.213
Why is nothing familiar to us?

15:00.366 --> 15:04.086
I see myself in the mirror
and I recognize my face.

15:05.170 --> 15:09.240
I know Tatha and Danu,
but the person I thought I was...

15:09.642 --> 15:11.910
You're telling me
there is no village.

15:11.911 --> 15:12.781
No sickness.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.939
The little I can remember
is false.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.316
How can we all not feel
completely lost?

15:18.317 --> 15:20.118
Danu has told us that you insist

15:20.119 --> 15:21.819
there were no magicks involved.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.670
That what we suffer
is simply a malady.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.858
It's more of an emotional shield.

15:26.859 --> 15:30.061
We found you in a crypt
surrounded by monsters.

15:30.062 --> 15:33.498
It's normal for the human psyche
to put itself in a safe mode.

15:33.499 --> 15:36.267
We want to accept
your diagnosis, doctor.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.603
And we are grateful for all
that you've done. It's just -

15:38.604 --> 15:40.574
You're still not buying it.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.876
The clinical term is
schizoaffective disorder.

15:44.877 --> 15:49.080
It's a delusional state stemming
from acute post-traumatic stress.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.716
But we are all three suffering
from the same disorder.

15:51.717 --> 15:52.884
How is that possible?

15:52.885 --> 15:55.453
Delusional behavior occurring
virally in groups is rare,

15:55.454 --> 15:59.384
but it's not undocumented,
particularly amongst siblings.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.966
Look, let me put it this way.

16:04.063 --> 16:08.843
There is no logical or physical way
that your memories can be real.

16:09.101 --> 16:11.102
And the sooner you accept that,

16:11.103 --> 16:14.253
the sooner we can continue
to make progress.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.937
Excellent timing.
I'm starved.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.085
They are beautiful.
- They truly are.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.092
I've never seen
anything like them.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.493
They are frightened.

16:36.996 --> 16:37.626
Oh, yes.

16:38.897 --> 16:41.299
Well, quite confusing,
I'd imagine.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.700
Waking up here,
no memories.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.802
Believing you're
from the Middle Ages.

16:44.803 --> 16:45.493
Are they?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.139
Well, there's the rub.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.875
I can't quite rule
the possibility out.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.377
When Will first
entered the crypt,

16:52.378 --> 16:54.345
he said he set off some
sort of mechanism

16:54.346 --> 16:56.948
that drained the coffins
of a green-hued liquid,

16:56.949 --> 16:58.983
which, thankfully,
I was able to preserve.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.194
You think this kept them alive?

17:01.587 --> 17:02.954
I don't know for certain,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.756
but it does contain
several key elements

17:04.757 --> 17:07.925
that could induce a form
of cryogenic stasis in humans.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.846
If they are not abnormals -

17:09.895 --> 17:12.635
I know. Why guard them
so ferociously?

17:12.998 --> 17:16.200
I want you to concentrate
on the sound of my voice.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.461
I'm going to count backwards
from five, four,

17:19.938 --> 17:21.098
three, two, one.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.063
Danu, can you hear me?

17:28.180 --> 17:28.520
Yes.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.218
I want you to go back
to the last thing you remember

17:34.219 --> 17:35.959
before you woke up here.

17:39.758 --> 17:40.748
The creatures.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.784
They're too strong.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.607
We can't escape.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.033
Why are they doing this?

17:49.034 --> 17:50.834
We've done nothing wrong!

17:53.806 --> 17:56.256
They're making us
drink something.

17:58.210 --> 17:58.850
Darkness.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.045
I want you to go back further.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.315
Find a memory of something
that happened

18:04.316 --> 18:06.416
before the creatures took you.

18:11.156 --> 18:11.856
Moonlight.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.394
I'm in a field.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.197
It's cold.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.426
I can sense the dead.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.469
Their souls extinguished.

18:30.843 --> 18:31.943
Only we remain.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.756
What do you make of these?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.051
I found them on the right-hand
index finger

18:40.052 --> 18:41.486
of each of the three women.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.254
Have you searched the database?

18:43.255 --> 18:45.590
Not yet.
It's on my "to do" list.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.125
But such distinctive markings

18:47.126 --> 18:50.595
generally indicate a connection
to a larger collective or group.

18:50.596 --> 18:53.736
If they belong
to a society of some sort...

18:53.799 --> 18:58.189
Then someone will definitely
have noticed that they're missing.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.341
Are they pissed
at being locked up,

19:03.342 --> 19:05.082
or are we getting close?

19:10.883 --> 19:12.683
Oh, they're here alright.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.452
We're bringing them home.

19:24.930 --> 19:25.790
Am I happy?

19:26.498 --> 19:27.018
Well...

19:29.268 --> 19:34.205
I'd definitely say that I'm more
stimulated here than in my old job.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.546
Wherever "here" is.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.643
You won't even tell me
where you're working.

19:38.644 --> 19:39.504
I told you,

19:39.711 --> 19:42.847
the people who run this clinic
are totally into privacy.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.149
I'm bound by all these
confidentiality agreements

19:45.150 --> 19:46.150
they made me sign.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.319
Well, at least tell me
what kind of work you're doing.

19:48.320 --> 19:52.640
I mean, is it more forensics?
Or clinical? Or research-based?

19:53.058 --> 19:54.208
Uh, it's, uh...

19:56.428 --> 20:00.031
You know, it's a little bit
of everything, um, really...

20:00.032 --> 20:03.267
- You know, cutting-edge stuff.
- Hold that elevator!

20:03.268 --> 20:04.708
What's up, new guy?

20:06.305 --> 20:08.095
I want to eat your face.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.376
What? Who's that?

20:10.776 --> 20:12.216
Uh. It's a patient.

20:16.281 --> 20:16.921
Patients.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.989
No, this is great, Will.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.418
I mean, I don't know
where you're working,

20:20.419 --> 20:23.321
or what kind of work you're doing,
aside from "everything. "

20:23.322 --> 20:24.589
You're never at your apartment.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.424
It's like you just
dropped off the map.

20:26.425 --> 20:30.061
Well, I'm just putting in
a lot of hours at the clinic,

20:30.062 --> 20:31.162
trying to get up to speed.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.603
You know how it is.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.120
Anyway, I just...

20:36.468 --> 20:39.658
I wanted to call
and make sure you're okay.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.608
Well, whatever it is you are doing,
you sound good.

20:45.644 --> 20:46.574
Well, thanks.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.448
I mean, it's no picnic,
believe me.

20:50.449 --> 20:51.489
But, you know,

20:52.251 --> 20:55.486
half the time I wonder
if I made the right decision,

20:55.487 --> 20:57.287
but I am sleeping better.

21:00.559 --> 21:01.319
Ironically.

21:02.127 --> 21:02.527
Will?

21:03.428 --> 21:03.828
Yeah?

21:05.297 --> 21:07.797
You're seeing someone,
aren't you?

21:08.200 --> 21:09.940
What?
No, Meg, come on.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.737
Forget it.
It's none of my business.

21:12.738 --> 21:16.941
Look, I appreciate the call.
Uh, good luck with your new job.

21:16.942 --> 21:17.982
No, hey, wait.

21:22.514 --> 21:22.914
Crap.

21:23.815 --> 21:24.275
Ooh...

21:25.417 --> 21:27.567
Women.
Can't live with 'em...

21:27.619 --> 21:29.179
But you can eat them.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.337
All good, Mom.

21:39.564 --> 21:42.900
The city is now minus one ugly,
poodle-eating chameleon guy.

21:42.901 --> 21:43.881
Are you hurt?

21:44.236 --> 21:45.566
No, not a scratch.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.140
I'll redo your bandages
when you get home.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.809
But before you do, I need you
to look into something for me.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.770
We found these rings
on the three women from the crypt.

21:58.383 --> 21:58.903
Pretty.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.152
I've traced it back
to an ancient cult

22:01.153 --> 22:03.143
known as Cabalis Nocturnum...

22:03.488 --> 22:06.490
...a secret society
founded in roughly 700 A.D.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.759
I'm still collating data,
but from what I can tell,

22:08.760 --> 22:10.995
they were collectors
of ancient beings of power.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.864
Well, they had crappy taste
in bling, that's for sure.

22:13.865 --> 22:16.467
I have reason to believe that
this cabal might still be operating,

22:16.468 --> 22:18.636
and I need to know how big
a threat they could pose.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.538
See what Squid
has to say about the markings,

22:20.539 --> 22:21.672
then I want you home.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.474
You got a bad feeling
about this?

22:23.475 --> 22:24.575
Off the charts.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.445
Okay, I'm on it.
Love you.

22:27.446 --> 22:28.486
Love you, too.

22:30.782 --> 22:31.122
Hey.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.685
What's the matter?
You can't sleep?

22:34.686 --> 22:35.676
Dr. Zimmerman.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.157
I know Dr. Magnus asked
we stay in our quarters,

22:40.158 --> 22:42.608
but the views
from your windows...

22:44.529 --> 22:47.679
They are so captivating.
I could not resist.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.372
What do you feel
when you look out there?

22:54.373 --> 22:54.943
I am...

22:56.375 --> 22:57.135
...curious.

23:01.179 --> 23:01.989
And afraid.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.484
Afraid of what?

23:13.759 --> 23:17.419
When I sleep at night,
all I see are dead faces...

23:20.866 --> 23:21.916
...haunting me.

23:23.301 --> 23:24.341
Asking me why.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.020
You want us to remember
who we are.

23:36.014 --> 23:39.744
Well, perhaps there is
a good reason that we forgot.

23:54.699 --> 23:57.268
Hey. I saw your light was on.
You mind if I -

23:57.269 --> 23:58.309
No, of course.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.054
You're up late.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.032
So are you.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.976
You keeping watch
over the ranch?

24:05.977 --> 24:09.007
I rarely sleep unless
my patients do, too.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.535
How is Danu?

24:12.050 --> 24:14.652
She's feeling
a lot of irrational fear,

24:14.653 --> 24:16.693
low self-esteem, raw emotion.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.657
I've seen it before
in kidnapping victims

24:19.658 --> 24:21.808
held for long periods of time.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.994
They tend to forget
they have value

24:23.995 --> 24:26.797
and just start seeing
themselves as property.

24:26.798 --> 24:30.534
That assessment may be far
more accurate than you realize.

24:30.535 --> 24:31.502
How do you mean?

24:31.503 --> 24:33.304
Have you ever heard
of the Morrigan?

24:33.305 --> 24:34.525
The Morrigan? No.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.475
But, then again,
I haven't been able to memorize

24:37.476 --> 24:40.096
that monster manual
you gave me yet.

24:40.545 --> 24:43.581
They're part of an ancient legend
dating back to medieval times -

24:43.582 --> 24:45.583
three women
with supernatural powers

24:45.584 --> 24:48.324
whose sole purpose
was to destroy men.

24:49.921 --> 24:50.855
So I see we're back

24:50.856 --> 24:53.996
to the 1,200-year-old
bath products theory.

24:54.993 --> 24:58.496
The Morrigan first appeared
during the reign of King Arthur.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.127
Now, according to myth,

25:00.732 --> 25:02.666
when the Morrigan appeared
on the battlefield,

25:02.667 --> 25:05.636
Arthur's enemies
simply began dropping dead,

25:05.637 --> 25:07.137
their souls drained of life.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.773
Entire armies
were wiped out en masse.

25:09.774 --> 25:12.076
Do you honestly believe
that they're witches?

25:12.077 --> 25:13.587
From the Middle Ages?

25:13.645 --> 25:15.846
What history would
have defined as a witch

25:15.847 --> 25:17.848
could have simply been someone
with abnormal powers.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.250
Yeah, but they don't have
any powers.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.385
You said so yourself
when you checked them out.

25:21.386 --> 25:23.476
None that we've yet detected.

25:26.825 --> 25:29.615
Each of them was wearing
one of these.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.030
Now, this is the mark
of an ancient cabal of collectors

25:33.031 --> 25:36.800
who sought and exploited abnormals
for their own personal gain...

25:36.801 --> 25:40.391
...and apparently guarded
their possessions fiercely.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.265
So, why would this cabal
hold the sisters prisoner

25:44.910 --> 25:47.110
if they don't have any powers?

25:47.512 --> 25:50.132
Another reason
why I'm not sleeping.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.649
They're not nightmares.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.095
That field... All the dead...

26:00.759 --> 26:03.209
We were actually there
that night.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.796
It's more than that.

26:10.368 --> 26:11.758
We were the reason.

26:39.297 --> 26:40.577
Easy, Steve. Easy.

26:59.684 --> 27:00.324
Ladies...

27:05.023 --> 27:07.057
I'm pretty sure
we have rules about...

27:07.058 --> 27:08.578
...floating and stuff.

27:12.197 --> 27:12.767
Oh, oh.

27:13.431 --> 27:17.151
What say you just come down
and we talk about this?

27:22.540 --> 27:22.940
Crap.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.945
That's quite enough of that.

27:37.722 --> 27:39.882
I had everything under control.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.894
You know how
when stuff blows up

27:43.895 --> 27:45.696
and I say "man,
this is going to cost you,"

27:45.697 --> 27:48.032
and you say, "Henry,
stop being so dramatic"?

27:48.033 --> 27:48.613
Henry...

27:49.234 --> 27:52.036
- This is going to cost you.
What was affected?

27:52.037 --> 27:54.137
Well, the central lab, mostly.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.433
Diagnostics,
MRl systems are gonzo.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.577
Oh, and I think our
Internet is down.

28:00.578 --> 28:02.446
What about security protocols?

28:02.447 --> 28:03.714
Well, redundancies kicked in,

28:03.715 --> 28:06.350
so nothing mean and ugly
got free, which is good,

28:06.351 --> 28:10.254
but our perimeter alarm systems
are totally fried, which is bad.

28:10.255 --> 28:13.757
Focus on external defenses.
Leave the lab for later.

28:13.758 --> 28:15.759
Why, are we expecting
more trouble?

28:15.760 --> 28:17.294
Yeah, no, that
was a stupid question.

28:17.295 --> 28:18.215
I'm outside.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.139
Witches from the Middle Ages.

28:24.302 --> 28:25.569
Okay, I'm almost there,

28:25.570 --> 28:29.910
but assuming their physical forms
could somehow be preserved...

28:31.109 --> 28:34.678
Again, how is it possible
that they can speak like us?

28:34.679 --> 28:36.747
I'm assuming that each of them
is a teleaesthetic,

28:36.748 --> 28:40.651
enabling them to quickly learn
our vernacular of English.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.642
Psychic powers, mind reading.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.192
Well, now we know
what this cabal wanted them for.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.693
Yeah, for all the good
it's done us.

28:49.694 --> 28:51.094
- Ow.
- Hold still.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.664
Hey, you didn't know
what they could do.

28:53.665 --> 28:57.134
I should have, the moment
I connected them with the cabal.

28:57.135 --> 29:00.204
Performed more invasive scans,
psychotropic drug therapy -

29:00.205 --> 29:03.507
You're running a medical facility,
not Guantanamo Bay.

29:03.508 --> 29:04.808
Cut yourself some slack.

29:04.809 --> 29:06.319
You don't understand.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.479
Assuming the cabal
are after them -

29:08.480 --> 29:09.847
and we'd be fools not to -

29:09.848 --> 29:12.049
The amount of kinetic energy
that they released

29:12.050 --> 29:13.860
could hardly go unnoticed.

29:14.185 --> 29:18.035
We're all in imminent danger.
They cannot remain here.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.432
And what does that mean?

29:22.894 --> 29:24.528
It means that if the legend
of the Morrigan

29:24.529 --> 29:26.099
is even slightly true,

29:26.197 --> 29:28.065
they could conceivably
wipe out hundreds,

29:28.066 --> 29:28.932
even thousands of lives,

29:28.933 --> 29:30.153
given the chance.

29:30.702 --> 29:34.171
We're not talking about a bunch
of velociraptors here.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.572
Before their memories
came back,

29:35.573 --> 29:37.341
they were calm,
rational women.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.476
And even when they did
let loose with their powers,

29:39.477 --> 29:40.977
they didn't kill me.

29:42.981 --> 29:43.851
They just...

29:44.349 --> 29:45.682
...melted my brain a little bit.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.584
And destroyed half my facility.

29:47.585 --> 29:49.653
Well, they've been held prisoner
for hundreds of years.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.854
They had a right to be pissed.

29:51.956 --> 29:55.086
It doesn't mean
we can't reason with them.

29:56.294 --> 30:00.264
All three will remain under sedation,
at least for the time being.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.475
And how long is that?
Forever?

30:04.569 --> 30:06.303
How does that make us
any different than the cabal

30:06.304 --> 30:09.104
who imprisoned them
in the first place?

30:24.789 --> 30:26.299
Dr. Magnus was right.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.119
We should never
have been woken up.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.649
You can't stay asleep forever,
Danu.

30:34.199 --> 30:35.879
You deserve to be free.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.401
Our purpose is not to be free.

30:39.404 --> 30:43.140
Our purpose is to bring death
to the enemies of the cabal.

30:43.141 --> 30:45.401
And you think
we're the enemy?

30:46.344 --> 30:50.074
You took us from our home,
away from our protectors.

30:51.249 --> 30:53.749
You were held prisoner
in a crypt.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.666
What kind of a home is that?

30:57.188 --> 30:59.790
If our masters deem it so,
then it is so.

30:59.791 --> 31:00.071
No.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.703
That's what they
want you to think.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.598
They want you to believe
that they're your protectors,

31:07.599 --> 31:08.809
but they're not.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.202
They're using your powers
for their own good.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.343
They gave us life,
they gave us our powers.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.911
Who says you weren't born
with these gifts,

31:20.912 --> 31:25.572
that this cabal simply found you
and forced you to kill for them?

31:31.322 --> 31:35.692
You asked me how you could all
suffer from the same disorder.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.530
This dissociation between
what's real and imagined.

31:39.964 --> 31:43.567
It's because somebody planted
those thoughts in your heads.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.637
And the sooner you realize
those thoughts aren't real,

31:46.638 --> 31:49.106
then you'll remember
who you truly are.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.327
A thousand men...

31:50.808 --> 31:51.208
Danu?

31:54.345 --> 31:57.905
A thousand men marched
on Badon Hill that morning.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.544
All were dead before nightfall,

32:02.720 --> 32:06.100
all without the touch
of either sword or spear.

32:07.058 --> 32:10.018
And now that we are free,
more will die.

32:11.963 --> 32:13.823
That is our purpose, Will.

32:14.432 --> 32:18.272
Until now, because you didn't
think you had a choice.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.063
But you do.

32:24.542 --> 32:28.252
How can we ever be free
after all that we've done?

32:53.504 --> 32:53.964
Squid!

32:55.640 --> 32:57.030
Did you bring them?

32:57.041 --> 32:58.321
Yep. Yummy snacks.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.010
Get 'em while they're...

33:00.011 --> 33:00.651
...alive.

33:01.579 --> 33:03.139
Ugh. It's about time.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.373
Alright.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.221
You said you have information
on the cabal for me.

33:11.222 --> 33:11.742
Well...

33:14.025 --> 33:15.595
You and your mother...

33:15.760 --> 33:17.260
You really don't like
to attract normal,

33:17.261 --> 33:19.162
run-of-the-mill enemies,
do you?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.853
Now, searching the cabal

33:20.865 --> 33:22.366
really stirred up
the people in my network,

33:22.367 --> 33:24.467
got them buzzing like insects.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.737
Dude, most of the people
in your network are insects.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.639
- That's real nice, Ash.
- What did you find out?

33:29.640 --> 33:33.243
They've been playing the same
capture and study game

33:33.244 --> 33:37.364
for a hell of a lot more years
than your mother and you.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.418
You'd be surprised.
Go on.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.765
Intel has it their mandate -

33:43.354 --> 33:46.223
Was to capture creatures
with strange powers, I know.

33:46.224 --> 33:47.591
We got three
of their assets on ice.

33:47.592 --> 33:48.992
What are they up to now?

33:48.993 --> 33:49.753
Everything.

33:50.561 --> 33:51.371
Come again?

33:52.230 --> 33:56.200
Well, the cabal supposedly
died out in the 19th century,

33:57.301 --> 33:58.511
but they didn't.

33:58.736 --> 33:59.836
They just went underground.

33:59.837 --> 34:01.905
They started
infiltrating businesses,

34:01.906 --> 34:04.786
medical and scientific
research companies,

34:05.510 --> 34:08.850
banks, biotech firms, uh,
military think tanks -

34:10.848 --> 34:12.382
All under their control.

34:12.382 --> 34:13.132
Holy crap.

34:13.551 --> 34:17.154
Yeah, I mean, these guys
are one James Bond film away

34:17.155 --> 34:18.735
from global domination.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.491
- So stealing their property -
- No, no, no.

34:21.492 --> 34:22.926
Would not go over well.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.996
Word has it they're
on the move with, uh,

34:26.297 --> 34:28.130
upright bloodhounds
with big teeth and claws.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.411
Keepers. How many?

34:29.467 --> 34:31.701
Uh, enough to create
a real mess.

34:31.702 --> 34:34.782
I mean, whatever it is
you took from them,

34:35.005 --> 34:37.266
they're coming to take it back.

34:39.944 --> 34:40.634
You mind?

34:41.212 --> 34:44.062
No, no. Bon appetit.
Go crazy, go nuts.

34:44.148 --> 34:45.188
Oh, thank you.

34:47.185 --> 34:47.465
Mm.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.013
Well, that is not good.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.972
As long as they're conscious,
they are a threat.

35:08.973 --> 35:11.741
As long as they're here,
they are a threat.

35:11.742 --> 35:14.511
Danu's psychological state
is so fragile right now,

35:14.512 --> 35:16.179
any more trauma,
any more amnesia,

35:16.180 --> 35:18.248
she may never be
this self-aware again.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.684
I can get through to her.
I just need more time.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.552
Time is not something
we have in abundance, Will.

35:22.553 --> 35:23.653
Listen to me, listen to me.

35:23.654 --> 35:24.521
She has been brainwashed

35:24.522 --> 35:27.190
to think this cabal
is somehow all-powerful.

35:27.191 --> 35:28.401
I mean, come on!

35:28.526 --> 35:29.046
Ashley.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.061
We've definitely
got trouble incoming.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.162
I'll be home
as soon as I can...

35:32.163 --> 35:34.903
...but this is
a much bigger problem -

35:35.933 --> 35:36.273
Mom?

35:37.802 --> 35:38.142
Mom!

35:40.238 --> 35:40.758
Dammit.

35:50.481 --> 35:51.548
Come in, Magnus.

35:51.549 --> 35:53.783
So, um, nasty creatures
with bad dental work

35:53.784 --> 35:54.985
have reached
the outer perimeters.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.016
I'd recommend a level-5
internal lockdown.

36:02.426 --> 36:03.066
Magnus...

36:05.563 --> 36:06.373
That works.

36:06.397 --> 36:08.131
We need to get the Morrigan
out of here immediately.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.333
- Agreed. Any ideas?
- Near the shoe.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.203
There's an escape tunnel
with an exit leading to the river.

36:13.204 --> 36:14.838
I have a safe house
just outside the city.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.841
There's a map programmed
into this. Take this.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.310
- What are you going to do?
- You wanted time.

36:20.311 --> 36:22.271
I'm going to buy you some.

36:35.092 --> 36:36.293
Where the hell
have you been?

36:36.294 --> 36:38.864
- We need weapons.
- We need Ashley.

37:12.830 --> 37:13.230
Crap.

37:19.503 --> 37:22.173
Danu, we're getting you
out of here.

37:22.373 --> 37:23.506
They have come for us.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.841
But that doesn't mean
you have to go with them.

37:24.842 --> 37:26.309
They will never
stop looking for us.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.577
We must go with them.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.914
Do you really believe that
you deserve to live in a crypt?

37:30.915 --> 37:33.635
Because if you do,
I won't stop you.

37:34.385 --> 37:35.715
You would free us?

37:35.886 --> 37:36.226
Yes.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.935
But we have to go right now.

37:44.228 --> 37:46.696
I want you to stay and defend
the habitats at all costs.

37:46.697 --> 37:51.468
If we fall, initiate level-9 lockdown
protocol and seal yourself inside.

37:51.469 --> 37:52.969
Please. Do as I say.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.244
Where are we going?

38:11.722 --> 38:12.822
Away from here.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.557
- Will...
- Go, go, go!

38:25.036 --> 38:27.470
Take this. It's a map.
Follow the purple line.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.751
- Will, I -
- Go!

38:34.145 --> 38:35.235
Mom, I'm home!

38:37.748 --> 38:38.148
Good.

38:38.516 --> 38:39.582
Grab what weapons you can

38:39.583 --> 38:40.617
and meet us
in the catacombs.

38:40.618 --> 38:42.185
Will's headed to the river gate
with the Morrigan.

38:42.186 --> 38:44.854
The keepers are following.
We'll make our stand there.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.085
- Henry?
- Hello?

38:46.457 --> 38:47.657
You heard the plan?

38:47.658 --> 38:51.098
Weapons, catacombs, check.
I'll see you in five.

38:56.701 --> 38:57.331
Damn it.

38:58.436 --> 38:59.066
Drop it.

39:01.639 --> 39:02.559
Aw, come on.

39:03.541 --> 39:04.761
Keep them coming.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.516
Um, these aren't mine.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.487
Just put 'em on the ground.

39:41.245 --> 39:42.745
Shoot 'em!
I can't!

39:53.958 --> 39:54.478
Well...

39:55.226 --> 39:56.676
That never gets old.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.741
You left the safety on.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.532
Yeah, I'm going to play
to my strengths.

40:02.533 --> 40:02.993
You...

40:03.601 --> 40:04.701
You shoot people.

40:04.702 --> 40:05.102
Okay.

40:06.103 --> 40:06.853
Follow me.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.369
Mom! Are you okay?

40:11.342 --> 40:12.609
I'm fine.
Did you get them out?

40:12.610 --> 40:13.470
I think so.

40:13.477 --> 40:14.511
If they can read
Google maps,

40:14.512 --> 40:15.712
they should be
well on their way.

40:15.713 --> 40:16.980
Where the hell is Henry?

40:16.981 --> 40:17.381
Here.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.492
This is a private
medical facility.

40:29.493 --> 40:30.960
You are trespassing
on my property.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.941
Trespassing?
You have stolen what is ours.

40:34.331 --> 40:36.191
The Morrigan belong to us.

40:36.834 --> 40:39.803
Hand them over now
or we tear this place apart.

40:39.804 --> 40:42.704
I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:43.474 --> 40:46.976
My keepers are keyed to find them,
no matter where they go.

40:46.977 --> 40:49.887
Your keepers are dead
all over my house.

40:52.416 --> 40:53.976
Do you have any more?

40:54.151 --> 40:56.131
Last chance.
No more games.

40:58.622 --> 40:59.262
Ashley...

41:00.191 --> 41:03.091
It'll get messy,
but just say the word.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.801
Take their weapons.

41:08.466 --> 41:08.866
Stop.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.818
There will be no more killing.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.361
We will go quietly.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.375
But we ask that you leave
these people unharmed.

41:19.376 --> 41:22.111
You don't make demands.
You do as we say.

41:22.112 --> 41:25.515
They did not take us out of greed,
but out of charity.

41:25.516 --> 41:27.786
We ask you leave them
unharmed.

41:30.187 --> 41:31.554
It seems that a taste
of freedom

41:31.555 --> 41:33.425
has changed their demeanor.

41:34.959 --> 41:38.695
We take back what's ours,
you and I have no problem.

41:38.696 --> 41:41.266
These women
are under my protection.

41:41.298 --> 41:45.068
They're not leaving with you
or anyone else, for that matter.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.749
Then we have a problem.

41:50.274 --> 41:54.174
Danu. Please, stay with us.
We can protect all of you.

41:55.212 --> 41:58.522
If we stay, none of you will
ever know peace.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.460
You have shown
us a path,

42:01.519 --> 42:03.419
a truth we have
never seen before.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.850
And we are grateful
for all that you have done.

42:07.358 --> 42:07.638
No.

42:08.592 --> 42:10.552
No, you can't go, not now.

42:10.561 --> 42:13.701
Our freedom must be earned.
In our own way.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.630
We know who we are now.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.820
Put them in separate trucks.

42:35.119 --> 42:37.549
I'd be careful
what you do next.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.123
The people I work for
aren't the forgiving type.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.104
Neither am I.

42:42.126 --> 42:44.506
Tell them
this is far from over.

42:45.095 --> 42:46.895
Now, get off my property.

42:56.507 --> 42:59.647
- You think we've lost them?
- You tell me.

43:01.011 --> 43:02.745
I think I needed more time.

43:02.746 --> 43:05.782
I think you've done more good
than you realize.

43:05.783 --> 43:08.384
We gave them the choice
to be free.

43:08.385 --> 43:10.755
What they do next is up to them.
