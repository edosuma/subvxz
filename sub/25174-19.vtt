{\an1}- They let her go.
Budget cuts.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.338
- Caroline? Caroline?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.466
- She's probably exhausted
from making false accusations

17:30.549 --> 17:32.676
against students.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.636
- Oh, you wanna know
why she's passed out?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.765
Because our school doesn't
get any funding.

17:37.848 --> 17:41.727
Teachers aren't the problem.
The government is.

17:43.312 --> 17:47.316
If you want your children
to get a better education,

17:47.399 --> 17:49.693
then you need to put pressure
on the school board

17:49.777 --> 17:51.945
so that we get
better financial support.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.655
Not just for our paychecks,

17:53.739 --> 17:56.784
but for your kids.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.495
Help us help our students.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.664
Teacher contract
negotiations are coming up,

18:02.748 --> 18:05.334
and I think it's time
that we join forces

18:05.417 --> 18:08.712
so teachers and students
get the funding they deserve.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.255
[cheers and applause]

18:16.678 --> 18:18.847
{\an3}I let my desire to be
a good mother get in the way

18:18.931 --> 18:21.433
{\an3}of sticking with my fellow
teachers and sisters.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.478
{\an3}I'm sorry.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.855
{\an3}And, Chelsea...
Chelsea?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.106
{\an3}- [snoring]

18:29.900 --> 18:32.194
- Listen, if you
expect the teachers

18:32.277 --> 18:33.570
to do more for the students,

18:33.654 --> 18:35.697
they're gonna need
more resources.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.032
{\an3}- No.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.868
- Then if you're not going
to give us more resources,

18:39.952 --> 18:41.370
we need more support staff.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.789
We're spread too thin.
- No.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.750
- Okay, if you want us to do
all these things ourselves,

18:46.834 --> 18:48.418
then we need to be compensated.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.628
- [chuckles] No.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.713
{\an3}- So you want us to do
all this extra work

18:51.797 --> 18:53.465
{\an3}outside of our jobs
and not get paid for it?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.717
{\an3}- No.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.427
I mean, yes.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.471
{\an3}I'm just so used
to saying no.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.808
Look, I'm sorry, but things
just aren't going to change

19:02.891 --> 19:04.351
this school year.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.812
You're just gonna have
to learn to live with that.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.314
{\an1}- Okay, while we're
spitting truths,

19:09.398 --> 19:12.276
{\an1}your husband kissed me on the
lips at a New Year's Eve party,

19:12.359 --> 19:13.527
{\an1}and it was longer
than three seconds.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.572
And you're just gonna have
to learn to live with that.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.997
{\an3}- [clears throat]
Next order of business.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.791
Somebody say something.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.209
- I wanna talk about that more.
