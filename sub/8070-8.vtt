[tone]

00:04.338 --> 00:21.122
[tone]

00:21.222 --> 00:23.257
Today's the day.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.726
24 hours in hell.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.195
All right.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.196
I must clear my mind.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.070
That is cold.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.038
She probably has
a good hour on me.

00:41.609 --> 00:42.976
Got to get up.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.946
Got to stay out all day.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.248
Minimize the damage.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.950
Get far away from ground 0.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.419
Getting too old for this.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.259
The horror.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.260
The horror.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.665
[shushing]

01:04.765 --> 01:06.800
OK, before Dan gets
up, let's go over

01:06.900 --> 01:08.736
the plans for a surprise party.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.738
Crystal, what do
you have to report?

01:10.838 --> 01:13.107
Well, first of all, I'd like
to thank you for selecting

01:13.207 --> 01:15.143
me to do the decorations.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.077
You're quite welcome.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.480
And in light of
our $40 budget,

01:19.580 --> 01:24.218
I have decided upon
balloons and stupid hats.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.653
Good choice.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.322
And now can we hear
from the cake committee?

01:28.422 --> 01:32.226
Two peas in happy, right?

01:32.326 --> 01:34.061
How are you going to get
Dan down there, Roseanne?

01:34.162 --> 01:35.329
Oh, I'm just
going to tell him,

01:35.429 --> 01:37.465
hey, the lodge is having
another all you can eat night,

01:37.565 --> 01:39.300
and you've got to be there
to defend your crown.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.304
So what should we do?

01:43.404 --> 01:45.839
OK, Becky you're going to help
Crystal with the decorations.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.642
And Darlene, I don't care
if you want to go or not.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.179
You're going.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.480
I hate these parties.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.548
No kid should ever be forced
to watch their parents do

01:54.648 --> 01:56.650
the Hully Gully.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.951
Not for the squeamish.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.221
Good morning, Dad!

02:00.321 --> 02:01.955
Crystal, let's get out
to those garage sale.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.458
Oh, yeah, you can always find
a bargain at the garage sale.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.593
Dad!

02:05.693 --> 02:06.894
Where you going?

02:06.994 --> 02:08.329
Fishing.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.530
Today?

02:09.630 --> 02:11.232
Goodbye.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.534
It's November, Dad
the lake is frozen.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.702
OK, then I'm going bowling.

02:14.802 --> 02:15.603
See you tomorrow.

02:15.703 --> 02:16.570
No, Dan.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.771
Wait.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.807
Don't you want to spend
the day with your family?

02:19.907 --> 02:22.510
What? is this some kind
of trick question, Jackie?

02:22.610 --> 02:24.245
What about the Michigan
and Illinois game, Dad?

02:27.281 --> 02:31.319
Don't you guys
realize what today is?

02:31.419 --> 02:32.886
Oh, Dan.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.188
I forgot.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.624
It's Dan's birthday.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.492
(SINGING) Happy birthday, Dan!

02:38.592 --> 02:39.727
Forget my birthday.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.162
Do I have to spell
it out for you?

02:42.263 --> 02:45.065
P- M- S.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.035
Oh, my God!

02:48.135 --> 03:33.581
[music playing]

03:33.681 --> 03:38.118
[laughter]

03:38.218 --> 03:39.253
Are you sure?

03:39.353 --> 03:41.455
Jackie, I've been
through this for 17 years.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.424
Every 28 days, 204 times.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.325
Yes, I'm sure.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.426
I don't know, Dan.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.495
Rosanne seemed perfectly
pleasant today.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.797
Hey, Crystal, when have
you ever known Roseanne

03:49.897 --> 03:51.999
to be perfectly pleasant?

03:52.099 --> 03:53.000
I'm going to go to the mall.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.167
I've got basketball practice.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.102
Me too.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.003
No, no.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.104
Hold on, Everybody.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.039
It's going to be a
24 hour roller coaster

03:59.139 --> 04:02.109
ride with Sybil at the switch.

04:02.209 --> 04:05.012
Oh, I know just before my time
of the month and those hormones

04:05.112 --> 04:08.048
get acting up, I'm good for
one solid day of pure mean.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.417
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.552
Once I went around and busted
a street light for every man

04:11.652 --> 04:13.454
who ever broke my heart.

04:13.554 --> 04:17.057
Yeah, I remember the
great blackout of '84.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.258
No, you can't leave.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.159
Jackie.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.328
Jackie, I'm warning you.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.829
If you don't let go of
me, I'm fully prepared

04:21.929 --> 04:22.896
to gnaw my own arm off.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.332
Dan.

04:24.432 --> 04:29.370
Dan, Roseanne's got a big
surprise party planned

04:29.470 --> 04:30.471
for you down at the lodge.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.839
There's going to
be like 50 people.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.973
- No.
- Yeah.

04:33.073 --> 04:33.874
It can't be. feel

04:33.974 --> 04:34.942
Now Dan, don't worry.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.846
Roseanne does not
have PMS today.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.747
Dan?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.388
Do you think I'm pretty?

04:50.424 --> 04:51.792
I'm out of here!

04:51.892 --> 04:59.166
[music playing]

04:59.266 --> 05:03.070
[music playing]

05:03.170 --> 05:05.038
OK.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.239
So far so good.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.813
Dan's out working in the
garage, out of the line of fire.

05:12.913 --> 05:13.714
Dan!

05:17.618 --> 05:18.486
Dan you in there?

05:18.586 --> 05:19.420
Yeah.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.854
What are you doing?

05:20.954 --> 05:23.691
Oh, just fixing
this thing here.

05:23.791 --> 05:24.592
Hair.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.594
Hair Is different.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.828
Do I like it?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.797
What if she doesn't?

05:29.897 --> 05:30.998
Gotta say something before--

05:31.098 --> 05:32.500
Do you like my hair?

05:32.600 --> 05:33.401
Too late.

05:33.501 --> 05:36.203
I love it?

05:36.303 --> 05:38.572
I can't believe it, Dan.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.609
I mean, I do something to
make myself a little bit more

05:41.709 --> 05:42.676
attractive to you.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.778
And you don't even notice.

05:44.878 --> 05:45.979
You think I do this for myself?

05:46.079 --> 05:49.950
I mean, the hair's on my
head, I can't even see it.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.853
God, you man.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.757
Oh, and you are taking me and
the kids to the lodge at 5:00,

05:56.857 --> 05:57.891
and that's that.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.159
I don't care if it is
your little birthday.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.665
Dan.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.202
I love you.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.645
5 o'clock.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.481
[music playing]

06:20.581 --> 06:22.650
No, Crystal, he does
not suspect a thing.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.885
Of course, I had to trick
him to get him to go.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.689
But no, he just thinks it's
another normal birthday dinner.

06:32.325 --> 06:36.129
Mom, you're
ironing the towels?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.198
Well, I can't wait
for you to do it, can I?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.135
Stay away from those towels.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.036
I have to re-fold them.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.175
Why don't you go put on that
pretty pink dress of yours

06:48.275 --> 06:51.479
with the little flowers on it?

06:51.579 --> 06:52.880
Oh, the pink dress.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.282
You mean the one I had on first.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.851
And tell your
sister to hurry up.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.386
You know, I swear this
whole family would just

06:59.487 --> 07:02.022
fall apart if I wasn't here.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.457
Oh, you're not wearing
that one, are you?

07:03.557 --> 07:04.357
No.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.462
Hurry up!

07:08.562 --> 07:11.865
I'm starving!

07:11.965 --> 07:14.635
Jeez, you know, this whole
surprise party thing sure

07:14.735 --> 07:16.369
seemed a lot better last week.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.206
Whose stupid idea
was this anyway?

07:19.306 --> 07:20.307
Well, I know what was, Crystal.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.577
But you don't have to
throw up in my face.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.580
Don't patronize me, Crystal.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.115
If you're going to have
that kind of attitude,

07:28.215 --> 07:30.017
you don't you have to
come if you don't want to.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.118
You want to, don't you?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.520
I mean, it wouldn't be
a party without you.

07:42.362 --> 07:45.699
[yells]

07:45.799 --> 07:47.668
You know, Dan, I've
been thinking maybe

07:47.768 --> 07:49.236
I ought to sign up
for night school

07:49.336 --> 07:51.639
and take a couple of classes
like in creative writing

07:51.739 --> 07:54.241
or word processing or
something like that, you know?

07:54.341 --> 07:55.308
Oh.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.678
OK, I'm supposed to
say something here.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.514
Let's try, that
sounds good honey,

08:00.614 --> 08:01.982
Or maybe what I
really should do it just

08:02.082 --> 08:03.584
join an aerobics class,
you know, and try

08:03.684 --> 08:04.685
to get in shape or something.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.186
Or maybe I could do
both of them together.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.487
But then I'd hardly
ever be home.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.388
I don't know.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.389
What do you think, Dan?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.491
Uh.

08:11.592 --> 08:16.263
Oh, you look like the
perfect little gentleman.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.698
Let's see your hands.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.599
They're filthy.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.467
Go wash them.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.503
You know, you ought to
wash your hands too, Dan.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.438
Oh, this tie.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.707
I've always loved this tie.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.709
See how it has the green
and the stuff on it.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.544
I know what I'll do, I'll
change it in my green dress

08:30.644 --> 08:31.444
so that we'll match.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.685
You guys stay away from
those clean towels.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.293
Dan!

08:46.393 --> 08:47.194
Save yourself.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.599
I just kind of want
to apologize to you,

08:51.699 --> 08:53.266
because well, I'm sorry that--

08:53.366 --> 08:57.237
I know I've been a
little excitable today.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.673
I didn't really notice, Honey.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.175
You know I asked
Darlene to do?

09:02.275 --> 09:05.445
I asked her to catalog all my
coupons according to expiration

09:05.545 --> 09:08.381
date and the four food groups.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.618
And then I start writing
this letter to my best friend

09:10.718 --> 09:12.419
from third grade, Sherry Jaggy.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.087
And I mean, I haven't
even had her address

09:14.187 --> 09:17.557
for something like 20 years.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.226
That's OK, Honey.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.262
I know you get a little
whacked out every now and then.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.163
What's your point, Dan?

09:23.263 --> 09:26.900
I really don't have a point.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.836
Now go ahead and
say it, because I know

09:28.936 --> 09:29.870
what you're thinking anyway.

09:29.970 --> 09:30.904
You think I have PMS.

09:31.004 --> 09:31.805
No.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.307
No, no, I wasn't thinking that.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.610
But I have been doing a
little reading on it lately.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.578
And you know they have these
pills now that are supposed

09:38.679 --> 09:40.881
to help, if you did have PMS.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.053
A pill?

09:46.153 --> 09:47.220
A pill?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.156
You want me to take a pill?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.524
Well, do they have
a pill for you, Dan?

09:55.495 --> 09:57.765
Let's go, Dan, we're going to
be late for Roseanne's surprise

09:57.865 --> 09:58.699
party.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.468
It's my surprise
party, Jackie.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.736
Why didn't you talk
her out of this.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.472
You know I hate
surprise parties.

10:05.572 --> 10:06.874
The only people who
ever have any fun

10:06.974 --> 10:09.309
are the people
who were in on it.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.510
Oh.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.081
Well, you're in on it.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.483
Can we go, so we
can get home already?

10:16.583 --> 10:17.718
Dad, what is she
doing in there?

10:17.818 --> 10:23.356
Changing into another outfit
or another personality?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.492
Let's just enjoy
one moment of peace.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.428
Dan!

10:28.528 --> 10:30.397
Get in here!

10:30.497 --> 10:42.209
[music playing]

10:42.309 --> 10:43.210
Love you, Daddy.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.790
You're going in.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.959
Could be a suicide mission.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.460
Stay low.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.361
Stay low.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.799
Don't worry.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.068
I'll get through this.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.903
Somewhere, your real
wife waits for you.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.178
Come here, you Big Sexy man.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.079
That's not her.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.014
[music playing]

11:21.114 --> 11:23.884
Of course, you don't have
to tell your real wife.

11:23.984 --> 11:31.091
[music playing]

11:31.191 --> 11:31.992
OK, we're out of here.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.696
Jeez, what were you
guys doing in there?

11:36.797 --> 11:37.597
Never mind.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.166
Let's go.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.901
Honey, come on.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.903
We're almost going
to be real late.

11:43.003 --> 11:43.804
I'm not going.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.440
OK.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.978
OK, look, we've been
through this before.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.113
We know she's got 100
different personalities.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.283
We've seen them all before.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.787
How can I go when we're
destroying the ozone layer?

12:05.959 --> 12:09.529
101.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.164
Kids, I want you
to remember this.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.433
PMS is serious stuff.

12:13.533 --> 12:17.370
Causes depression,
anxiety, physical pain.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.638
And it's rough on
your mother, too.

12:18.738 --> 12:23.476
[music playing]

12:23.576 --> 12:25.112
OK, listen, Everybody.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.847
I'm just going to check and
see if our table's ready.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.015
And I'll be right out.
You wait for me.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.689
Hey, OK, now nobody
gets the food, got it.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.925
And then I want you
all to get around

12:38.025 --> 12:39.659
the door here, with the
tallest people in the back.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.794
And be real quiet.

12:40.894 --> 12:44.097
And then when Dan comes
in, you yell, surprise.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.900
You know how you do it, right?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.201
Our table's ready.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.073
Surprise!

12:53.173 --> 12:55.508
[applause]

12:55.608 --> 12:56.910
(SINGING) For he's
a jolly good fellow,

12:57.010 --> 13:01.481
for he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow!

13:01.581 --> 13:02.415
All right, I'm starving.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.350
Let's eat.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.354
Isn't this great, Dan.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.588
All your friends are here.

13:08.688 --> 13:09.756
It's great, Roseanne.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.892
I-- I can't believe it.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.927
How did you ever do
this without me knowing?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.829
Wow, you really were
surprised, weren't you?

13:15.929 --> 13:16.930
Are you kidding?

13:17.030 --> 13:18.098
When I walk through
the door, and I saw--

13:18.198 --> 13:19.967
You know, Dan, we
really should have a song,

13:20.067 --> 13:21.301
shouldn't we?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.636
You know, because then whenever
we heard it, we would go,

13:23.736 --> 13:25.672
that's our song.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.274
Did I invite you?

13:27.374 --> 13:28.675
Oh, Eddie.
Eddie, hi.

13:28.775 --> 13:29.609
How are you doing?
- Oh, OK.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.978
Good to see you
Thanks for coming.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.513
You're all right then.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.116
Roseanne, I love your hair.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.385
See Dan?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.187
So what do you
think, Roseanne?

13:40.287 --> 13:41.088
About what?

13:41.188 --> 13:42.589
The decorations.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.557
I planned this all
very carefully.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.126
I bet you didn't even
realize that there

13:46.226 --> 13:47.527
are exactly 40 balloons here.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.400
40?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.702
Dan is 39, Crystal.

13:55.802 --> 14:01.174
[yells]

14:01.274 --> 14:02.842
Well, I'm sorry, Roseanne.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.545
I got him one to grow on.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.447
Well, you needn't
apologize to me, Crystal.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.317
Apologize to Dan for
ruining his party.

14:10.417 --> 14:16.223
[music - "kung fu fighting"]

14:16.323 --> 14:18.691
Got to say, there are some
damn good looking guys here

14:18.791 --> 14:19.592
tonight.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.928
Get off.

14:21.028 --> 14:21.995
Come on.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.797
It's been almost a
month Gary dumped you.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.666
I dumped Gary.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.734
Yeah.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.636
And now here you are
at some crummy party

14:29.736 --> 14:32.239
dancing with your sister.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.807
You know, it just breaks my
heart to see you like this.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.010
I'm fine.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.411
You don't have to yell at me.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.647
You know, I'm the one person
here that loves you the most.

14:40.747 --> 14:41.949
Roseanne!

14:42.049 --> 14:44.384
Oh, you know, if you
were not my sister,

14:44.484 --> 14:45.752
I just don't know who would be.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.623
Hey, Danny boy, you
having a good time?

14:50.723 --> 14:51.824
Yeah.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.160
You're probably wondering
why Nancy isn't hear.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.261
Who's Nancy?

14:54.361 --> 14:55.828
Well, she said she was
paying for everything.

14:55.929 --> 14:56.964
And I wouldn't
pull my own weight.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.932
And she kicked me
out of her apartment.

14:59.032 --> 14:59.866
And now I'm living in my car.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.134
You're kidding.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.803
Well, actually it's her car.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.506
So I guess poker night at your
place is pretty much out now.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.740
Why?

15:07.840 --> 15:10.010
Singing telegram
for Dan Conner.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.011
What's that?

15:11.111 --> 15:12.179
Well, me and the
guys got together

15:12.279 --> 15:13.213
and got you a little something.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.348
It's our way of
saying, happy birthday.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.450
Well, hello
there, birthday boy.

15:17.550 --> 15:25.858
[music playing]

15:26.960 --> 15:29.829
Out!

15:29.929 --> 15:33.433
Out, out, out, out, out, out!

15:33.533 --> 15:34.834
You know, you're the
reason why there will

15:34.934 --> 15:36.169
never be a woman president.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.277
Whose idea it was this?

15:48.381 --> 15:51.018
I might have known.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.153
But I blame you
for it, Dan Conner.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.888
Oh, I might have expected
it from your slimy friends,

15:55.989 --> 15:58.992
but not from the
father of my children.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.894
I'm sorry, dear.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.197
As if that's going to
make everything all right.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.665
Well, what about
that poor woman who

16:05.765 --> 16:07.300
was only trying to
do her job and now

16:07.400 --> 16:09.236
has been made to feel like dirt?

16:09.336 --> 16:11.704
And I have to go out there and
comfort her, thanks to you.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.946
Mental note.
Kill Arnie.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.360
Dan?

16:33.460 --> 16:34.727
Oh, Dan.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.131
Dan, she's making
people do the limbo.

16:38.798 --> 16:39.599
OK.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.971
Oh, my God.

16:45.072 --> 16:45.938
It's your ship.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.174
It's my birthday.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.142
There are no
birthdays in hell, Dan,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.244
now get in there before
somebody gets hurt.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.912
Just a minute, Jackie.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.615
I just realized
I'm 39 years old.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.649
39.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.418
By this time next
year, I'll be 40.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.552
40.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.787
That's almost middle aged.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.189
What have I done with my life?

17:02.289 --> 17:03.956
What have I accomplished?

17:04.057 --> 17:08.461
Cut the introspective
crap and get in there?

17:08.561 --> 17:11.531
I don't know why I have to
put up with this every month.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.100
So she's gone hormones.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.167
So?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.502
Why should she just
get away with this.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.436
How about me?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.537
When is it my turn?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.272
When does everybody have
to tiptoe around me?

17:19.372 --> 17:22.742
When do I get my PMS?

17:22.842 --> 17:23.643
All better now?

17:23.743 --> 17:24.544
Yeah, I'm good.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.447
Hey, come on, you guys.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.781
We're just about ready to
open up all the presents.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.586
The presents.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.422
That's almost the end, right?

17:35.522 --> 17:37.023
No.

17:39.992 --> 17:40.927
OK, come on, everyone.

17:41.027 --> 17:41.961
Gather around.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.062
Dan's going to open
his presents now.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.264
Come on.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.467
Look, everybody.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.835
It's a little crown.

17:48.935 --> 17:52.038
DJ made it himself.

17:52.139 --> 17:52.939
It's a macaroni face.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.944
Oh, look, honey.

17:58.044 --> 18:02.282
And he even spelled out Dad
using little tiny Spaghettios.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.950
(ALL) Aw.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.619
And you said he had no talent.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.121
Let's see what's
inside this one.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.059
Hang in there, champ.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.694
Only a couple more rounds to go.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.396
You're doing fine.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.030
OK, everybody, can
I have your attention.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.334
I'd like to pose a toast
to my husband, Dan Conner.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.637
So everybody hold
up your glasses.

18:24.737 --> 18:29.842
Higher,

18:29.942 --> 18:34.747
For you, Dan Conner, my
husband, my best friend,

18:34.847 --> 18:38.451
the father of these children.

18:38.551 --> 18:44.591
You are the ink in my pen.

18:44.691 --> 18:49.796
You are the paper
on which I write.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.899
We've been married for 17 years.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.336
We've had many wonderful times.

18:56.436 --> 19:00.273
We've had many, many bad times.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.841
Happy birthday, honey.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.176
[cheering]

19:03.276 --> 19:04.277
You know, like
that one time when

19:04.377 --> 19:05.245
we went and saw "Old Yeller."

19:05.345 --> 19:06.513
And you cried and cried.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.880
Remember, you made me promise
I'd never tell anybody

19:07.980 --> 19:09.282
that you cried like that.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.917
And I never have
in all these years.

19:11.017 --> 19:11.884
And I never will.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.792
Thank you, dear.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.196
So here's to you, Dan
Conner, my husband, my soul

19:23.296 --> 19:25.565
mate, my friend, my rock.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.701
God, please let this be over.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.870
A great big rock that
just sits on my couch

19:30.970 --> 19:32.939
and does nothing to watch TV.

19:33.039 --> 19:33.840
That's it.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.509
God's a woman.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.478
Oh, occasionally,
it'll as for a beer.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.879
And then I have to go
in there and get it,

19:39.979 --> 19:41.548
because after all,
it is just a rock.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.716
And a rock can't just camp
itself over and roll over

19:43.816 --> 19:45.752
to the refrigerator, can it?

19:45.852 --> 19:46.853
So I have to get
the beer for it.

19:46.953 --> 19:47.754
Yeah.

19:49.789 --> 19:53.626
A big, TV watching,
beer drinking rock.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.828
But he's my rock.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.096
And I must live with it.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.071
So happy birthday, Dan.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.038
Happy birthday, Dan!

20:06.138 --> 20:20.287
[singing happy birthday]

20:30.397 --> 20:31.731
Yes!

20:31.831 --> 20:34.467
I got my wish!

20:43.310 --> 20:45.678
Happy birthday, Dan.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.979
My birthday was
yesterday, Roseanne.

20:47.079 --> 20:47.614
Well, I know that.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.848
But you know what?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.617
We forgot to do your
traditional birthday breakfast.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.118
SO OK, what's it going to be?

20:52.218 --> 20:54.887
Pancakes, waffles, an omelette,
whatever you want, you know.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.489
Nothing is too good for my man.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.690
You know what?

20:57.790 --> 20:59.258
I think I'm just going to
go back to the bedroom,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.260
read the paper, and
not talk to a soul.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.395
Is that OK with you, Roseanne?

21:05.197 --> 21:10.202
God, he gets so damn moody
It comes every month, too.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.103
Man.
