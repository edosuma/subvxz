a terrorist organization

I don't know what it is, Chris. [LAUGHS]

40:57.623 --> 40:59.723
Something's changing. I just...

40:59.759 --> 41:01.792
I feel it. I f...

41:01.827 --> 41:03.192
I feel...

41:04.363 --> 41:06.730
Myself opening up.

41:09.492 --> 41:13.102
I saw Ray since I saw you last time.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.573
- Your brother-in-law?
- Mmm-hmm.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.251
In the hospital.

41:19.377 --> 41:21.811
I'd never seen him before.
I don't even know why I went.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.214
I just...

41:24.182 --> 41:26.082
Felt like I had to.

41:27.969 --> 41:31.254
Oh, and I got shot.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.588
- What?
- Yeah.

41:32.623 --> 41:33.856
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.524
Right there. It was pretty bloody.

41:35.559 --> 41:36.925
But it turned into a bruise,

41:36.960 --> 41:38.927
and Paul was kinda freaked out at first,

41:38.962 --> 41:41.357
but I was like, "You know what?

41:42.300 --> 41:44.266
I'm not gonna worry about it."

41:44.302 --> 41:47.503
Because sometimes you're just
ready for whatever comes.
