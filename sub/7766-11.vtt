00:12.999 --> 00:13.999
- Previously on

00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
"Vanderpump Rules..."

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- This is why you shouldn't
have a girlfriend.

00:16.999 --> 00:17.999
- Agreed.

00:17.999 --> 00:18.999
- I made it!

00:18.999 --> 00:19.999
- You made it!

00:19.999 --> 00:21.999
- You knew quickly exactly why.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.999
- We are going to...

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
Waikiki.

00:25.999 --> 00:26.999
- You've never liked James.

00:26.999 --> 00:27.999
- Why? It's my birthday.

00:27.999 --> 00:28.999
I don't want him there.

00:28.999 --> 00:29.999
- I'm not missing
a trip to Hawaii.

00:29.999 --> 00:30.999
That's for damn sure.

00:30.999 --> 00:31.999
- The hard part of
this whole thing

00:31.999 --> 00:32.999
is the guest list.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
- There was a slight argument

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
for Kristen cause they figured

00:35.999 --> 00:36.999
enough time had passed.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
- You know who gets to decide

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
how much time
has f***ing passed?

00:39.999 --> 00:40.999
Me!

00:40.999 --> 00:41.999
- Okay, Stassi.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
- What do you mean,
"Okay, Stassi?"

00:43.999 --> 00:44.999
- You won't find
anybody better than her.

00:44.999 --> 00:46.999
- I know, I love her so much.

00:46.999 --> 00:47.999
- Get that ring on her finger,

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
and walk her down the aisle
as soon as possible.

00:49.999 --> 00:52.999
- Katie Maloney,
will you marry me?

00:52.999 --> 00:53.999
- Of course!

00:53.999 --> 00:55.999
Oh, my God!

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
- It's official!

01:00.999 --> 01:04.999
- ♪ You know
that it's our time ♪

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
♪ These are the best days ♪

01:06.999 --> 01:09.999

01:23.999 --> 01:26.999
- I think this is literally
called the Rose Path.

01:26.999 --> 01:27.999
Yeah.

01:30.999 --> 01:31.999
Yeah, this is perfect, yeah?

01:31.999 --> 01:33.999
- Oh, yeah.

01:33.999 --> 01:34.999
There we go.

01:34.999 --> 01:35.999
Your balance is off.

01:35.999 --> 01:37.999
- Your lopsided because
that big rock on your finger.

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
- I am lopsided.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
- You got a freaking rock
on your finger.

01:41.999 --> 01:42.999
Bubba, isn't this nice?

01:42.999 --> 01:43.999
Anyway...

01:43.999 --> 01:44.999
- Oh, my God.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.999
- I just got engaged!

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
And she said, "Yes!"

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999
She said, "Yes!"

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
I love her!

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
- No, I would--it still hasn't
become, like, real

01:56.999 --> 01:59.999
'cause it just feel like I've
just been on, like, a cloud.

01:59.999 --> 02:00.999
- Pinch you.
- No.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
As much as
I've known and hoped

02:02.999 --> 02:06.999
and pressured and everything
to get to this point,

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
I am over the moon.

02:11.999 --> 02:12.999
- How about we make a rule

02:12.999 --> 02:14.999
that we have to have sex
every day beginning--

02:14.999 --> 02:15.999
- Ooh, whoa.
- Ooh.

02:15.999 --> 02:17.999
Every week?

02:18.000 --> 02:18.999
Leading up to our...

02:19.000 --> 02:19.999
Every month?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.999
- No, I'm kidding.

02:21.999 --> 02:23.999
- Here's my impression
of you last night.

02:23.999 --> 02:24.999
- That was bad.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
It was called being too drunk.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
- I woke up naked on the couch,

02:28.999 --> 02:29.999
and the taquitos were
burning in the oven.

02:31.999 --> 02:32.999
- I wouldn't say
it was a disaster,

02:32.999 --> 02:35.999
but we gave it a good effort.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.999
- So Stassi texts me
this morning--

02:39.000 --> 02:40.999
- Oh, my God.

02:40.999 --> 02:43.999
- She just said,
"I can't even begin to express

02:43.999 --> 02:46.999
"how happy it makes me
to hear about your engagement.

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
"When I heard the news,
I seriously got

02:47.999 --> 02:49.999
"this overwhelming
feeling of love.

02:49.999 --> 02:51.999
"I always thought
I'd be a part of that.

02:51.999 --> 02:54.999
"Crazy where life has
taken us, but just know

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
"I'm thinking of you
and so happy for you both.

02:56.999 --> 02:57.999
"Hope your Pinterest is ready,

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
and seriously,
homeboy did good."

02:59.999 --> 03:01.000
- I'll say this about Stassi:

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
there's been a correlation
with Katie being more relaxed

03:03.999 --> 03:06.999
and more positive ever since
Stassi's been out of her life.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
- I don't even know if her
and Patrick are still together.

03:08.999 --> 03:09.999
- Yeah, I don't know.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
- Yes, Stassi reached out

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
to text me about my engagement.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
It was nice and surprising,

03:15.999 --> 03:16.999
but that was the end of it.

03:16.999 --> 03:19.999
I don't want anything
to do with her.

03:19.999 --> 03:20.999
And I have to go to Sur.

03:20.999 --> 03:21.999
- No!

03:21.999 --> 03:22.999
- Well, it's okay.

03:22.999 --> 03:25.999
At least
I'm in a good mood, so...

03:25.999 --> 03:27.999
- So wait, just--
just for the record,

03:27.999 --> 03:29.999
when are you gonna get a tattoo
of my name on your ass?

03:29.999 --> 03:30.999
- Oh, grow up.

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
Hi.

03:40.999 --> 03:41.999
- Show me.

03:41.999 --> 03:44.000
- Bling!

03:44.999 --> 03:45.999
- Oh, my God!

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
- He did a really good job.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
It was--I was
completely shocked.

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
- So let's talk
about the nitty-gritty.

03:51.999 --> 03:52.999
Is the sex better?

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
- We were so drunk.

03:54.999 --> 03:55.999
- Girl, do not tell me

03:55.999 --> 03:57.999
that you did not
do the dirty last night.

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
- Well, we'll make up
for it tonight.

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
- Girl, don't give up.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
I mean, if I were married,
I wouldn't give up.

04:02.999 --> 04:03.999
Keep plugging along.

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
- So pretty.

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
- I love it,
I'm obsessed with it.

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
- Ah-ha!
- Hi!

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
- Anything to tell me?

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
Any news happening?

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
- I don't know.
What do you think? Is there?

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
- She's glowing today.
- Let's see it.

04:16.999 --> 04:17.999
Let's see it.

04:17.999 --> 04:18.999
- Right?

04:18.999 --> 04:19.999
- Finally!

04:19.999 --> 04:22.999
I feel as excited for Katie--

04:22.999 --> 04:26.999
almost as excited
as I was for Pandora.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
It's like, "Yes, finally!"

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
I'm happy for you, darling.

04:30.999 --> 04:32.999
Are you guys going
to Hawaii or not?

04:32.999 --> 04:34.999
- Yes, of course.
- Of course.

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
- Okay, you've got
your shifts covered?

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:37.999 --> 04:39.999
- Yes.
- Why are you smiling like that?

04:39.999 --> 04:40.999
- I--I don't
have one covered,

04:40.999 --> 04:41.999
but I will work on that.

04:41.999 --> 04:43.000
- What are we doing?

04:43.999 --> 04:44.999
- We're talking
about engagement rings.

04:44.999 --> 04:47.999
- How can I work--
- We can talk around. Let's go.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
- How can I work under
these kind of circumstances?

04:56.999 --> 04:57.999
- I'm out of ones.

04:57.999 --> 04:58.999
Let me know if you need change,

04:58.999 --> 05:00.999
and I can try to get change
from another bank.

05:02.999 --> 05:03.999
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
- Ah, how's it going?
- What's up, dude?

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
I got to let some people know
who's coming to Hawaii

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
and who's not coming
to Hawaii tonight,

05:10.999 --> 05:11.999
and some people are like,

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
"This schmuck over here
next to us is not coming.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
I don't want him
anywhere near me."

05:15.999 --> 05:16.999
No, I hear you.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.999
- Turns out that we are
excluding people from this trip.

05:18.999 --> 05:20.999
So if we're excluding people,
James is out.

05:20.999 --> 05:24.999
That being said, Friday,
I am inviting Kristen to lunch.

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
I figured since she can't
come on the Hawaii trip,

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
I'm gonna invite her
to my lunch.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.999
- Here's my thing with Doute.

05:30.999 --> 05:33.999
I'm always waiting
for her to, like, explode.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
- And there's a menu for you.

05:50.999 --> 05:52.999
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999
- Excuse me.

05:57.999 --> 05:59.999
- So--oh, Friday,

05:59.999 --> 06:03.999
I have a birthday lunch
that I'm doing.

06:03.999 --> 06:04.999
It's, like,
a Asian-infused restaurant.

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
It's something new and trendy.

06:06.999 --> 06:07.999
- Yes.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.999
- 'Cause you know how much
I love Asian infused.

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
Actually, Brittany set it up.
- Cool.

06:11.999 --> 06:13.999
- And I invited, obviously,
the usual suspects.

06:13.999 --> 06:14.999
- Yeah, all right.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.999
- And that being said,
I did invite Kristen.

06:18.999 --> 06:20.999
Since she's not
coming to Hawaii...

06:20.999 --> 06:21.999
- Hi.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
Hawaii!
- I know.

06:23.999 --> 06:24.999
I was just telling her
about Friday.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
Kristen is coming out.
Let them know.

06:26.999 --> 06:27.999
- We don't need to make issues

06:27.999 --> 06:29.000
where there wasn't
an issue anymore.

06:29.999 --> 06:30.999
- I just didn't want
to step on anybody's face.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.000
- Are you coming?

06:32.999 --> 06:33.999
- What?
- Are you coming?

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
- Is that really
a question?

06:35.999 --> 06:36.999
- Yes it is.
- Oh, no.

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
I'm not gonna come 'cause--

06:38.999 --> 06:41.999
'cause it's a really big deal
to me that Kristen's coming.

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
- So you're being sarcastic.

06:43.999 --> 06:44.999
- Yes, absolutely.

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
- Ariana, you can spaz out
over who comes to the party,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.999
or you can be cool,
but you can't be both.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
- You're creating something
where there was nothing.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.999
That's what makes me upset.

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
I would never make you
look like an ass****.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.999
- See you ladies later.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
- No one's making you
look like an ass****.

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
- You have done that.
- Even yourself.

07:01.999 --> 07:02.999
- No.
- When you're rude,

07:02.999 --> 07:04.999
then that--
you're doing that...

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
- As you talk over me.
- You make yourself look bad.

07:06.999 --> 07:07.999
- As you talk over me.

07:07.999 --> 07:08.999
That's a big problem I have.

07:08.999 --> 07:11.999
You talk over me,
you put words in my mouth,

07:11.999 --> 07:12.999
and that's what
makes me feel

07:12.999 --> 07:13.999
like you guys
aren't true friends,

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
and I don't
appreciate that.

07:15.999 --> 07:16.999
I don't have to f***ing
like Kristen,

07:16.999 --> 07:18.999
and I don't
have to be around her,

07:18.999 --> 07:19.999
and I don't have
to be friends with her.

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
And if telling them
that I'm gonna do me

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
is somehow offensive to them...

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
bye.

07:25.999 --> 07:26.999
- For you to say
that Katie and I

07:26.999 --> 07:28.999
aren't real friends
after everything

07:28.999 --> 07:31.999
I've been there for you for,
that just is--I--

07:31.999 --> 07:35.999
that just hurts my feelings,
and it's not like that.

07:35.999 --> 07:38.999
Fighting with Ariana is like
fighting with a brick wall.

07:38.999 --> 07:39.999
It's not gonna go anywhere.

07:39.999 --> 07:40.999
It's not gonna change.

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
- I said, "You do you,
and I'll do me."

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
- This is pointless.
- "And we're all fine."

07:44.999 --> 07:46.000
- I'm--I'm not gonna
have this conversation.

07:46.999 --> 07:47.999
You're never going to win.

07:47.999 --> 07:49.999
- You don't listen.

07:55.999 --> 07:56.999
- Cheers ladies.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.999
- Yes!
- Cheers!

08:06.999 --> 08:09.999
- Oh!

08:09.999 --> 08:10.999
- I just want to go--
- I need a break.

08:10.999 --> 08:13.999
- I just want to go home.

08:13.999 --> 08:14.999
- I know.
You'll do that every day.

08:14.999 --> 08:17.999
You'll stare at it
every day.

08:17.999 --> 08:18.999
So not to change
the subject completely,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.999
but Jax was like,
"Oh, so, you know,

08:20.999 --> 08:21.999
my birthday lunch
on Friday..."

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
He goes, "I told Ariana
Kristen's gonna be there,"

08:23.999 --> 08:26.999
and then she's doing
her sarcastic thing.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
And I was like,
"So are you not going?"

08:28.999 --> 08:29.999
She's like,
"Why would I not go?"

08:29.999 --> 08:32.999
So Jax walks away,
and she said that

08:32.999 --> 08:36.000
she feels that you and I
aren't real friends.

08:36.999 --> 08:37.999
- How are we not...

08:37.999 --> 08:38.999
- Because she said
that we're

08:38.999 --> 08:41.999
constantly throwing
Kristen in her face,

08:41.999 --> 08:43.999
and her real friends
wouldn't do that.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.999
Okay, bitchy Barbie,
like, calm the f*** down.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
I literally just walked away.

08:49.999 --> 08:50.999
- It's what happens
when you start

08:50.999 --> 08:53.999
holding yourself back
from something

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
at the expense someone else.

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
That's when it really starts
to put the strain on you.

08:57.999 --> 08:58.999
That's what I felt
with, like, Stassi.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.999
- It seems like Ariana

09:00.999 --> 09:02.000
viciously wants
to cut people out of her life,

09:02.999 --> 09:03.999
Like, "Well, if you
want to be friends with her,

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
then we're done,"

09:05.999 --> 09:06.999
and that's such a Stassi move.

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
Like, are you kidding me?

09:08.999 --> 09:09.999
We're all adults here.

09:09.999 --> 09:13.999
30 years old.
Like, get the f*** over it.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
She's just not the girl
I became best friends with

09:15.999 --> 09:17.999
three years ago.

09:17.999 --> 09:20.999
You know her and I were so
f***ing close for years,

09:20.999 --> 09:23.999
and then the past,
like, six months, maybe,

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
I feel like she's just starting
to, like, resent us.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
- Now what's gonna
happen in Hawaii?

09:27.999 --> 09:30.999
Like, are we just gonna,
like, all ignore each other?

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
- We definitely need to have
another conversation with her

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
before Hawaii because
I don't want this tension

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
the whole time we're there.

09:36.999 --> 09:37.999
- I don't either.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
- Coming up...

09:40.999 --> 09:41.999
Stassi is back.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.999
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Back where?

09:44.999 --> 09:45.999
- She's come in here
a couple times.

09:45.999 --> 09:46.999
And if she comes back here,

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
she's gonna have
to come through me first.

10:04.999 --> 10:06.999
- All right, and do we
need a few more minutes

10:06.999 --> 10:08.999
with the menu,
or are we ready to order?

10:12.999 --> 10:13.999
- Hey.

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
I need to steal bottle of vodka.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- Okay.
- What can I steal? A bottle.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
- Haven't you stolen
enough bottles of vodka?

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
- Yeah, that's why
I'm borrowing this one.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.999
- Saw it coming. Hi.
- Hi.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.999
- Busy night?
- Flying in here.

10:27.999 --> 10:29.999
- Did you hear
about the engagement?

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
- Yeah, fantastic.
- See the ring?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
- Did you see the ring?
- Of course. Anyway, listen.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.999
We got a busy night,
but just letting you know

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
that Stassi is back.

10:38.999 --> 10:39.999
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Back where?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.999
- She's come in here
a couple of times.

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
I don't want her
niggling her way

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
into the whole kind of circle.

10:45.999 --> 10:46.999
And if she comes back here,

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
she's gonna have to
come through me first.

10:48.999 --> 10:53.999
Stassi flounced out of here
and she was derogatory about me.

10:53.999 --> 10:54.999
She called me an old woman,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.999
and she was disloyal
to the restaurant,

10:57.999 --> 11:00.999
and she was dismissive
of all of her friends.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
- I shouldn't have
come here.

11:02.999 --> 11:07.999
I can't be in, like,
an area where everyone is fake.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
- All I ever wanted Stassi to do

11:12.999 --> 11:16.999
was to acknowledge the fact
that I did a lot for her.

11:16.999 --> 11:19.999
She knows exactly
what I did for her.

11:19.999 --> 11:22.000
There's a lot of unfinished
business here with her.

11:22.999 --> 11:23.999
I do not want free drinks.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
I do not want
unfinished conversations.

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
I do not want
anything happening here.

11:27.999 --> 11:28.999
Do you understand?

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
- That sounds great.
- Yeah, that's good.

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
- I'd give a drink for free out
to the homeless person outside

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
before I give a drink to her.

11:34.999 --> 11:35.999
Stassi really
just didn't disappear.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.999
She kind of pissed off everyone.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
She's gonna be shocked
to hear this,

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
but we've been getting along
just fine without her.

11:42.999 --> 11:45.999
- Okay, listen.
We have 450 covers, okay?

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
- I got to go back to work.

11:50.999 --> 11:51.999
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah, what's up?

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
- Do you mind if I
take a real quick break?

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
- Five minutes.

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
- Five minutes?

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
Oy.

11:58.999 --> 11:59.999
- Oy, mate, what's up?
- What's up?

11:59.999 --> 12:00.999
- You all right?

12:00.999 --> 12:02.000
How's it going, man?

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
- Just chilling, man.

12:03.999 --> 12:04.999
It's packed up in there.
I love it.

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
I love the vibe right now.
Been spinning all day.

12:06.999 --> 12:09.999
- So I talked to Tom
about Hawaii.

12:09.999 --> 12:10.999
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
And he said something
along the lines of,

12:12.999 --> 12:15.999
"The reason why Jax
has an issue with you going

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
is because Tom doesn't
want Kristen to go."

12:17.999 --> 12:18.999
And it's sort of, like,

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
a passive aggressive
behavior from all them.

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
- That's the best excuse.
- That's the excuse they have.

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
But also because,
you know,

12:24.999 --> 12:25.999
you go ape-sh**
when you drink,

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
but, you know, I told them that
you haven't been drinking

12:27.999 --> 12:29.999
for like, you know--
what is it?

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
10, 11 days now?
- 11 days. 10, 11 days.

12:30.999 --> 12:31.999
- Which is the first step.

12:31.999 --> 12:33.999
- I mean, I had
a beer, but whatever.

12:33.999 --> 12:35.999
I'm not, like, trying
to get all blacked out.

12:35.999 --> 12:38.999
And like, trying to be
serious about this, you know?

12:38.999 --> 12:39.999
Especially I'm not gonna
go do that in Hawaii.

12:39.999 --> 12:41.999
- Well, I don't see why you
don't just show up anyway.

12:41.999 --> 12:43.999
Just buy your ticket and go.

12:43.999 --> 12:44.999
- I mean, I'll talk to Jax.

12:44.999 --> 12:46.999
I'm just gonna be chill
about it, you know?

12:46.999 --> 12:47.999
Game plan for talking to Jax:

12:47.999 --> 12:49.000
nod my head
to everything he says

12:49.999 --> 12:50.999
and get invited.

12:50.999 --> 12:51.999
And it's gonna work

12:51.999 --> 12:53.999
because Jax is such a dumbass.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.999
I'll have a pineapple
f***ing piña colada

12:55.999 --> 12:57.999
in my hand in no time.

12:57.999 --> 12:58.999
There's not really
much else I can do.

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
- I think he'll say yes.
- We'll see.

13:08.999 --> 13:10.999
- What is that?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.999
- It's called
a Strawberrini.

13:14.999 --> 13:15.999
- Hey, what's up?

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
- What's going on, man?
- How are you?

13:17.999 --> 13:18.999
- I'm all right.

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
- I just heard
about the Hawaii trip

13:19.999 --> 13:22.999
and obviously, like,
everyone's going, like,

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
you know, I just
wanted to know, like,

13:24.999 --> 13:25.999
the status on, like,
you know, what--

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
where I stood with
that whole situation.

13:27.999 --> 13:31.999
- Um, I mean,
I feel like it--

13:31.999 --> 13:32.999
like, you're a liability.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
- Well, mate, I just
want to know also, like,

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
like, I haven't
had a drink in 10 days.

13:36.999 --> 13:37.999
I had one beer last night,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.999
and this isn't
gonna be sloppy James,

13:39.999 --> 13:40.999
like, moping around,
being an idiot.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
- It's my birthday.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
- What I say goes. It's my day.
- Yeah.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
- It's my week.
- I understand.

13:45.999 --> 13:46.999
- It's my everything.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
The other day when
I was just talking to Lala...

13:48.999 --> 13:49.999
You're a very dangerous
girl to be around.

13:49.999 --> 13:51.999
- Yeah.
- You're very, very dangerous.

13:51.999 --> 13:52.999
- Hi.
- Hello, babe. How are you?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
- You don't need to get
up in there and be like,

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
"Yo, yo, yo, what's going on?"
- I apologize about that.

13:56.999 --> 13:59.000
- I'm not trying to get in her
pants or anything, I'm not.

13:59.999 --> 14:00.999
If I wanted to, I could've.
- Right.

14:00.999 --> 14:01.999
I never said you were trying
to get into her pants.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
- But I was having a drink,
and your like,

14:03.999 --> 14:05.999
"I bought that for Lala.
Where's Brittany?" I'm like...

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
- I'm sorry; I felt, like, just,
like, a little bit weirded out.

14:07.999 --> 14:10.999
- I'm not--dude, like I said--
- I know you're not trying now.

14:10.999 --> 14:11.999
Obviously I see Brittany,
I've seen you guys

14:11.999 --> 14:14.999
taking pictures together, I know
it's, like, more serious now.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.999
- If I wanted to take Lala down,
if I wanted to sleep with her,

14:17.999 --> 14:19.999
if I wanted to be with her,
I could be with her in a second.

14:19.999 --> 14:20.999
- If Jax had more than, like,

14:20.999 --> 14:22.999
three or four
brain cells up in there,

14:22.999 --> 14:24.999
he'd realize that he actually
wanted me on this trip.

14:24.999 --> 14:27.999
I mean, I want to go to Hawaii
so I can get with Lala.

14:27.999 --> 14:28.999
Lala doesn't
then flirt with Jax,

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
Jax doesn't get
in trouble with Brittany,

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
and, quite frankly,
the whole trip goes smoothly.

14:32.999 --> 14:33.999
All 'cause of me.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
You're welcome, Jaxie boy.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
Jax, I guarantee you
if you give me

14:37.999 --> 14:40.999
this one chance, mate,
just to have fun with you lot.

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
- If I say you can go,
I don't want to eat my words.

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
- Dude, you
will not have to, man.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
Like, I just found out
Max is going too, like,

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
we're not trying to take away
anything from you lot.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
So I can go?

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
- Yeah, but...

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
you're, like, on thin ice, man.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
It's actually time
to practice what I preach.

15:00.999 --> 15:02.999
I'm all about
forgiving and forgetting,

15:02.999 --> 15:03.999
and I'm trying
to tell Tom and Ariana,

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
forgive and forget with Kristen,

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
so if I didn't forgive
and forget with James,

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
then I'd be a little bit
of a hypocrite.

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
- All right, cheers, man.

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
I'm glad we had this talk, okay?

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
- Yeah.
- All right.

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
Dumbass.

15:28.999 --> 15:30.999
- Come in.

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
Hi.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
- I've never seen him.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.000
- Recently, I've been feeling,

15:36.999 --> 15:37.999
you know, closer with Kristen,

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
which I didn't think
I ever would again.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
Do you want to see it?

15:41.999 --> 15:42.999
- I want a hug,
and I want to see it,

15:42.999 --> 15:43.999
and I'm gonna start to cry.

15:43.999 --> 15:46.999
- Don't cry, it's happy.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.999
- Oh, I can't deal.

15:49.999 --> 15:52.999
Kristen did some
really f***ed up things,

15:52.999 --> 15:55.999
and she's really trying
to prove herself,

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
and I think it's time
to acknowledge that

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
and allow her back
into the group a little bit.

15:59.999 --> 16:01.999
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
- Okay, so tell me about--
- And to you, Cupid.

16:03.999 --> 16:05.999
- I did one really good job.
- Five years ago.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.999
- I just--other people, maybe,

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
Stassi and Jax,
not a good thing.

16:09.999 --> 16:11.999
Schwartz, Sandoval, and I

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
all lived together--
we were roommates--

16:13.999 --> 16:15.999
and when Katie and I
became friends,

16:15.999 --> 16:17.999
I knew it was perfection.

16:17.999 --> 16:18.999
Two peas in a pod.

16:18.999 --> 16:20.999
They're the exact same person.

16:20.999 --> 16:23.999
- The amount of people
that, like, texted me

16:23.999 --> 16:25.999
and, like, reached out to me
and, like, on Face--

16:25.999 --> 16:26.999
I mean, everything is crazy.

16:26.999 --> 16:28.999
Like, even, like,
Stassi text me.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
- I talked to her today.

16:31.999 --> 16:34.999
I asked her
if she saw it or knew,

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
and she's like, "Yeah,"
and I go, "Did you text her?"

16:36.999 --> 16:37.999
She's like, "I did."

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
- I responded,
I mean, just said,

16:39.999 --> 16:42.000
you know, "Thank you,
and thank you of reaching out."

16:42.999 --> 16:43.999
- Stassi and I talk a lot.

16:43.999 --> 16:46.000
I know that Stassi
is f***ing heartbroken,

16:46.999 --> 16:47.999
the same way that it killed me

16:47.999 --> 16:48.999
to not be there
for Katie's engagement.

16:48.999 --> 16:50.999
Like, remember when
we used to sit around,

16:50.999 --> 16:52.999
like, you, me, and Stassi,
like watch YouTube videos

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
of like engagement,
like, proposals?

16:54.999 --> 16:55.999
- Yes.
- I feel like no one

16:55.999 --> 16:58.000
ever says yes right away,
'cause you're just so, like...

16:58.999 --> 16:59.999
- Oh, I just was--
I was just like--

16:59.999 --> 17:00.999
I was, like, gobsmacked.

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
I still have, like--
like, today, he left,

17:02.999 --> 17:03.999
he's like, "Bye, fiancée."

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
I was like, "Bye, fiancé."

17:04.999 --> 17:07.999
Like, we're, like, engaged.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.999
- It's insane.
- Finally.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.999
- I know that
10 years from now,

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
we're all gonna look back
on this stupid,

17:15.999 --> 17:17.999
brief time in our life
when we weren't friends.

17:17.999 --> 17:20.999
It really, really sucks
that Katie's engagement

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
had to happen during
that stupid, brief time.

17:22.999 --> 17:25.999
- So you're come to Jax's
birthday lunch.

17:25.999 --> 17:26.999
- Yeah.
- Yes?

17:26.999 --> 17:27.999
- I know Ariana and Tom
will be there, so.

17:27.999 --> 17:28.999
- Oh, are they? Okay.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
- Yeah.
- I actually didn't know.

17:30.999 --> 17:31.999
- But, yeah.
- But that's fine.

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
- They'll be there.
- They got their way.

17:33.999 --> 17:34.999
I don't get to go to Hawaii,
but I'm not gonna

17:34.999 --> 17:36.999
not come to Jax's birthday lunch

17:36.999 --> 17:38.999
because they're
bent out of shape about it.

17:38.999 --> 17:39.999
Like, get over it.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
Go pack a bikini.

17:41.999 --> 17:42.999
- Coming up...

17:42.999 --> 17:44.999
- I love to flirt with Jax,

17:44.999 --> 17:46.999
and I don't know how to stop.

17:46.999 --> 17:47.999
- Are you gonna
make this awkward?

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
- I'm gonna have to
talk to her about it.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
- Here you are, darling.
- Thank you.

18:15.999 --> 18:16.999
- Hi.
- Hello.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.999
- I spoke to Jax yesterday.

18:18.999 --> 18:19.999
He basically just said I am

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
welcome to come to Hawaii.

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
- Jax wants you
to go to Hawaii?

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
- Well--I don't really know
if he wants me to go.

18:24.999 --> 18:25.999
He was just being
a bit of a--

18:25.999 --> 18:27.999
well, a bit of a wanker
on this.

18:27.999 --> 18:28.999
- Well, why go?

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
- You know, Lala's
gonna be there.

18:30.999 --> 18:31.999
- You know what I don't like?
- What?

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
- It's almost like a game
between the two of you.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
It's like she's a trophy,
and she's not a trophy.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
She's a young woman
that is working here.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.999
- Jax and Lala are nothing.
- It's not like a competition.

18:39.999 --> 18:41.999
- Listen to me,
it's not a a competition.

18:41.999 --> 18:42.999
- There--it isn't
a competition.

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
- Okay.
- You're right.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.999
I hate to compare myself
to someone as stupid as Jax,

18:46.999 --> 18:49.999
but, you know, I'm striving
to become the best I can be.

18:49.999 --> 18:51.999
And, you know,
he's still striving

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
to make a f***ing
cosmopolitan correctly.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.999
- This is so ridiculous,

18:55.999 --> 18:57.999
I can't even begin to tell you.

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
You want Max to go?

18:58.999 --> 18:59.999
- Yes.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
- I don't know about you two
going with this lot.

19:01.999 --> 19:03.000
- Why?
- Really.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.000
- I'll take care of Max.
I'll make sure he's--yeah.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
- You'll take care of Max.
Who's gonna take care of you?

19:07.999 --> 19:09.999
- Well, Lala
can take care of me.

19:09.999 --> 19:10.999
- James...

19:10.999 --> 19:12.999
Oh, why am I worried?

19:12.999 --> 19:14.999
I have such a paragon of virtue.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
James Kennedy
taking care of my son.

19:16.999 --> 19:19.999
"Relax, Mommy,
everything's fine."

19:19.999 --> 19:21.000
And what you think of Faith?
You like Faith?

19:21.999 --> 19:22.999
- Yeah, Faith's really cool.
- Okay, good.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
- He better stick it out
for me, though,

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
'cause I still need that
friend-to-friend action,

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
you know?

19:27.999 --> 19:29.999
- Oh, so you've got
an ulterior motive?

19:29.999 --> 19:30.999
- Of course.

19:30.999 --> 19:33.999
- So that's why you like
Max being with Faith

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
because it gives you
access to Lala.

19:35.999 --> 19:36.999
You're a sneaky little--

19:38.999 --> 19:40.999
Max is gonna be the perfect
wingman for me in Hawaii.

19:40.999 --> 19:41.999
We're gonna be chilling
one second.

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
Then, when I need some
alone time with Lala,

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
I'm gonna give him the little.

19:45.999 --> 19:46.999
He's gonna go take
Faith around the corner,

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
give her a little doozy
around the bend,

19:48.999 --> 19:49.999
and I'm gonna
have my time with Lala.

19:49.999 --> 19:51.999
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Okay.

19:51.999 --> 19:52.999
- I don't want
anything permanent.

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
I'm sure you'll
do something stupid,

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
but don't do anything
permanently stupid, okay?

19:56.999 --> 19:57.999
- Permanently stupid.
- Look at me.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
get your bar shift covered,

19:59.999 --> 20:03.999
get your DJ shift covered,
and look out for my son.

20:03.999 --> 20:05.999
- Thank you.

20:06.999 --> 20:08.999
- ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

20:08.999 --> 20:10.999
♪ Oh, oh ♪

20:14.999 --> 20:15.999
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

20:16.000 --> 20:17.999
♪ Oh, oh ♪

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
- Hello, welcome.
- Hi.

20:22.999 --> 20:24.999
- These are cute.
- I know.

20:24.999 --> 20:26.999
It's only, like,
three nights' worth of tips

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
for one bathing suit.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
But they're--these are
the cutest bathing suits,

20:30.999 --> 20:31.999
like, you'll see anywhere.

20:31.999 --> 20:35.999
- So are you girls
staying together

20:35.999 --> 20:36.999
or with the boys?

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
- I don't want any
boys in my room.

20:38.999 --> 20:39.999
- We're staying just me and her.

20:39.999 --> 20:41.999
Never know who we
might run into.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.999
These Polynesians
out there on that island.

20:44.999 --> 20:45.999
- You say that now.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.999
- When you put
a few drinks in me...

20:47.999 --> 20:50.999
This trip is going
to be full of eye candy.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.999
I'm a sucker for Polynesians,

20:52.999 --> 20:53.999
and I'm a sucker for tattoos.

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
It's heaven for Lala.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
- Lala, have you been
to Hawaii before?

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
I know Faith hasn't.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
- Yeah, I have, but I--

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
the last time I was
there, I was, like, 18.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
- I just like the color.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
- I want to renew
our vows in Hawaii.

21:11.999 --> 21:14.000
- Oh, my God.
Your cheeks are so pretty.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
It's like, where's the meat?

21:16.999 --> 21:17.999
- Are you ready for this?

21:17.999 --> 21:19.999
- Oh, my God.
- Do I leave them on?

21:19.999 --> 21:20.999
- Yes!
- Okay, just a second.

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
Wait, did you cover
the whole nip?

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
- Hurry up,
I'm getting bored out here.

21:24.999 --> 21:26.000
- Scheana!

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
Come to mama.

21:29.999 --> 21:30.999
Do you think I'll be okay

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
if I wear just these
as my swimsuit?

21:32.999 --> 21:34.999
- Yeah.
- Okay, Katie and Ariana

21:34.999 --> 21:35.999
are totally gonna want
to hang out with you

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
if you wear those.

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
- Lala needs to understand

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
she's going on this trip
with a bunch of girls

21:40.999 --> 21:43.999
and their boyfriends,
fiancé, husband.

21:43.999 --> 21:45.999
Walking around
with pasties and a thong

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
is not gonna go over well.

21:47.999 --> 21:50.999
- Sale rack!
This is my type of rack.

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
- I think this is a bra,

21:51.999 --> 21:53.000
but that could totally
be a bathing suit.

21:53.999 --> 21:54.999
- It's cute, right?
- Mm-hmm.

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
- I'm a little nervous about

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
Max and James going.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.999
- To Hawaii?
- Yeah, a little bit.

21:59.999 --> 22:02.999
It's so crazy because
I love hanging out with him

22:02.999 --> 22:03.999
and I love making out with him

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
and, like, hugging him,
whatever.

22:05.999 --> 22:07.999
There's only one
thing that's missing,

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
and it's like, you have--

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
the person you're with,
you have to...

22:10.999 --> 22:11.999
- Yeah.
- Want to have sex with.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
Well, I have news for you.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
I touched James' pee-pee.

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
- What?
How big is it?

22:17.999 --> 22:18.999
- Um...

22:18.999 --> 22:20.000
Let's just say,

22:20.999 --> 22:21.999
my condom drawer
is full of Magnums,

22:21.999 --> 22:25.000
and James would not
be able to use any of those.

22:26.999 --> 22:29.999
- That's why the whole
James thing still confuses me.

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
- I haven't f***ed
him yet, so...

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
- How much you want to bet

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
she sleeps with James in Hawaii?

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
- I think it'll happen.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
If the right combination.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
Drinks, more drinks.

22:38.999 --> 22:39.999
A lot of drinks.

22:39.999 --> 22:40.999
Shots?

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
- Don't give James any--
- It could happen.

22:42.999 --> 22:43.999
- I wouldn't want him
to get whiskey dick.

22:43.999 --> 22:44.999
- Whiskey dick!

22:45.000 --> 22:46.999
- Can we talk about
one other thing, though,

22:46.999 --> 22:47.999
that I'm stressing about?

22:47.999 --> 22:48.999
I love to flirt with Jax,

22:48.999 --> 22:50.000
and I don't know how to stop.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
- Oh...
- I don't know how to stop.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
- You want to f*** her so bad.

22:56.999 --> 22:58.999
- I got to put these flames out.

22:58.999 --> 22:59.999
- Obviously
if I knew that Brittany

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
was driving all the way
from Kentucky

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
to move in with him,

23:03.999 --> 23:05.000
I'd behave myself.

23:05.999 --> 23:06.999
- Were you not texting him

23:06.999 --> 23:08.999
at 4:00 a.m. after Lock & Key
to come over and f*** you?

23:08.999 --> 23:09.999
- Yeah, definitely did.

23:09.999 --> 23:12.999
I said, "Boy,
come get in my bed."

23:12.999 --> 23:14.999
- That could've been cuddling.
- That means the same thing.

23:14.999 --> 23:17.999
- But I didn't say f***,
so don't put words in my mouth.

23:17.999 --> 23:20.999
I take full responsibility
for being a flirt,

23:20.999 --> 23:23.999
but some days, Jax is with some
bitch from Kentucky.

23:23.999 --> 23:24.999
Other days, he's not.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
This is way too
complicated for me.

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
- So, I mean, I wouldn't
recommend being disrespectful.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
- No, I don't intend
to disrespect anybody.

23:30.999 --> 23:32.000
- No, but I'm saying,

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
even if you're flirty, she's
gonna see that as disrespect.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
- No, I know, the goal
is I'm not gonna--

23:36.999 --> 23:37.999
I'm steering clear.

23:37.999 --> 23:38.999
When I get to Hawaii,

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
I think the best plan
is to take a note

23:40.999 --> 23:42.999
from one of the frigid bitches

23:42.999 --> 23:44.999
and how to act like a lady.

23:44.999 --> 23:45.999
- Are you gonna get that?

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
- Probably not,

23:46.999 --> 23:47.999
but I want everything in here.

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
- I know, it's so cute.

23:48.999 --> 23:50.999
- One day, when I'm rich,
I'll come back.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
- Babe, I don't know if there's

23:59.000 --> 24:00.999
enough room to hang
anything else in here.

24:00.999 --> 24:02.999
- There better be room.

24:02.999 --> 24:04.999
I'll literally have a meltdown
if I see mess.

24:04.999 --> 24:05.999
- Yeah, I know.

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
- We're definitely
taking another step

24:07.999 --> 24:08.999
in our relationship
right now.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
I have to say,
Brittany moving in

24:10.999 --> 24:11.999
is very comfortable for me.

24:11.999 --> 24:13.000
I mean, we've hit
a really good stride.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
- So did you talk to James
about Hawaii yet?

24:15.999 --> 24:18.999
- He kind of gave me the whole,
like, puppy dog routine,

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
like, "I want to come and
hang out with you guys and..."

24:20.999 --> 24:26.999
I think Kristen should go
before James and Faith and Lala.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
- Yeah, but didn't you
invite Lala to Hawaii?

24:28.999 --> 24:31.000
- I would never in
a million years invite Lala.

24:31.999 --> 24:33.999
You're invited to my birthday.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.999
Are you all right
with Lala going?

24:36.999 --> 24:37.999
- I mean, it's gonna
be kind of weird.

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
I haven't even talked to her.

24:39.999 --> 24:40.999
- I have this suspicion

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
that Lala wants
to sleep with me.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
But I only know that

24:44.999 --> 24:46.999
because she keeps telling me
she wants to sleep with me.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
- Scheana said that
she had just went

24:48.999 --> 24:51.999
swimsuit shopping
with Faith and Lala.

24:51.999 --> 24:53.999
She was just saying
it was gonna be hard

24:53.999 --> 24:54.999
to not flirt with you in Hawaii.

24:54.999 --> 24:56.000
What's going on?

24:56.999 --> 24:57.999
- I mean, I don't know.
I don't...

24:57.999 --> 24:59.000
- If you're showing
interest and, like,

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
making it seem like you are
interested, she's gonna think--

25:01.999 --> 25:02.999
- How am I making it seem--

25:02.999 --> 25:04.999
how am I making it seem like
I'm interested in her?

25:04.999 --> 25:05.999
- I just heard you
guys were, like,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.999
whispering in each other's
ears at the bar

25:08.999 --> 25:09.999
and tickling each other's backs

25:09.999 --> 25:11.999
and you have your arm
around her and stuff.

25:11.999 --> 25:13.999
- I wish Scheana would just

25:13.999 --> 25:14.999
shut her mouth sometimes.

25:14.999 --> 25:17.999
She really...

25:17.999 --> 25:19.999
Are you gonna make
this awkward in Hawaii?

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
- I'm gonna have to
talk to her about it.

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
- Ugh.

25:22.999 --> 25:23.999
- I'm just gonna
ask her, like, what--

25:23.999 --> 25:26.999
what happened
and what was going on.

25:31.999 --> 25:32.999
- Coming up...

25:32.999 --> 25:33.999
- Lala told me that James

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
couldn't fit
in the Magnum condoms

25:35.999 --> 25:37.000
because they were
too big for him,

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
and that's why she
hasn't had sex with him.

25:45.999 --> 25:49.999
- ♪ We are gonna run, run, run ♪

25:49.999 --> 25:52.999
♪ Into the sun ♪

25:52.999 --> 25:57.999
♪ We are gonna run, run, run ♪

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
♪ Into the sun ♪

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
- Hey!
- Oh, hi.

26:01.999 --> 26:02.999
- Happy Birthday.
- Yeah, it is.

26:02.999 --> 26:03.999
- How you doing?

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
- Happy Birthday!

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
- Hi!
- Hey!

26:07.999 --> 26:09.000
- Happy Birthday, almost.

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
Mwah, hello, everybody.

26:11.999 --> 26:12.999
- Thanks for coming.
- Absolutely

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
Thanks for having me.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
- Jax is turning 29
for the seventh time now?

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
- Seventh time.
- Yeah.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.999
- I'm pretty happy
with my birthday group.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
I mean, I got everybody
that I want to be there.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
Now, if Tom and Ariana
don't like that,

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
I don't really know what to say.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
- When it's less
quiet and awkward,

26:27.999 --> 26:30.000
I'm gonna have
a conversation with Sandoval.

26:30.999 --> 26:31.999
At least an attempt.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
And at least just to be like,

26:33.999 --> 26:36.999
"You got your way.
I'm not going.

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
What more do you need from me
to make this okay for everyone?"

26:38.999 --> 26:40.999
- I think that's a good idea.

26:40.999 --> 26:42.999
This is not a good idea.

26:42.999 --> 26:45.999
- Where should we sit?

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

26:47.999 --> 26:49.999
- Hey.

26:49.999 --> 26:50.999
What's up?

26:50.999 --> 26:51.999
- Jax and I are friends.

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
I've been mending
my friendships

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
with Scheana,
with Katie, with Schwartz.

26:55.999 --> 26:58.999
When it comes to Ariana, I'm
not even gonna waste my breath.

26:58.999 --> 27:00.999
Ariana can sit and pout
in the corner per usual

27:00.999 --> 27:02.999
while we enjoy our shots
and ice cream cake.

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
- Well, guys, you want to do it?

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
- Birthday shot.
- It's Tom and I.

27:06.000 --> 27:06.999
Happy Birthday!

27:07.000 --> 27:07.999
Happy Birthday!

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Cheers!

27:12.999 --> 27:14.999
- Since I'm not going to Hawaii.

27:14.999 --> 27:15.999
- Aww.

27:15.999 --> 27:18.999
- So I brought Hawaii
to our of the table.

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
- Thank you.

27:20.999 --> 27:23.999
- Kristen literally
can't help herself

27:23.999 --> 27:24.999
but to be passive aggressive.

27:24.999 --> 27:27.999
That one last little dig

27:27.999 --> 27:28.999
to make me look like an ass****

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
and make her look
like a good person.

27:30.999 --> 27:33.999
Get over it. Move on.

27:33.999 --> 27:34.999
- Speaking of who's
going and not going,

27:34.999 --> 27:36.999
did you guys hear about
what happened to Max?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.999
- No.
- No, what happened to Max?

27:38.999 --> 27:41.999
- He was feeling really
light-headed, fainted,

27:41.999 --> 27:45.000
hit a TV and a piece of wood
that was in the bathroom.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
One of the teeth got
scrapped in the wood.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
There were still pieces of it...

27:49.999 --> 27:50.999
- Ew.
- In the wood.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.999
All of his teeth
are f***ed up,

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
so James was amazing.

27:54.999 --> 27:56.999
Stepped up,
took him to the dentist.

27:56.999 --> 27:58.999
He had a 3 1/2 hour
surgery yesterday.

27:58.999 --> 28:01.999
He--thankfully he's on some
really good meds right now.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.999
Don't ask for any.

28:04.999 --> 28:08.999
But I don't know if he's
gonna be able to come.

28:08.999 --> 28:10.999
I've been there,
done that, flat on my face,

28:10.999 --> 28:12.999
knocked out my teeth,
several surgeries later,

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
the last thing
I would want to do

28:14.999 --> 28:17.999
is get on an airplane
to go on a vacation.

28:17.999 --> 28:21.999
It was one of the worst mouth
trauma things I've ever seen.

28:21.999 --> 28:23.999
Like, I don't know
how your tooth comes out

28:23.999 --> 28:24.999
and lodges in your lip.

28:24.999 --> 28:27.000
- Right, like, oh, God.
- It was--it was so bad.

28:27.999 --> 28:28.999
- ♪ Hey ♪

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
♪ Whoa, oh-oh ♪

28:30.999 --> 28:33.999
♪ Whoa, oh-oh ♪

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
- Baby.

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
They're pretty.

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
- Have you been here before?
- No.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
- Oh yeah, you came
here last night.

28:38.999 --> 28:40.999
- I've never been here before.
- You've never been here.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
- I had to take care of Maxie.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
- 10:00 in the morning,
I'm knocking on his door.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
He opens the door,
and he's got this f***ing face

28:46.999 --> 28:49.999
that looks like it's got 25
marshmallows shoved up into it.

28:49.999 --> 28:51.999
He's got blood all around it.

28:51.999 --> 28:53.999
- Maxie boy!

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
- What you doing here?

28:54.999 --> 28:55.999
- Checking on you.

28:55.999 --> 28:56.999
- I mean,

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
he was a complete,

28:58.999 --> 28:59.999
complete war-zone wreck.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
- You--you look good...
- Uh, yeah.

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
- Compared to the pictures
that I saw.

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
- Yeah, they were bad, so.
- How you feeling?

29:05.999 --> 29:06.999
- A lot better.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:08.999 --> 29:09.999
- Max, I'm sorry.
- Hi.

29:09.999 --> 29:12.999
- Your dad is on the phone.
- Okay, one sec, sorry guys.

29:12.999 --> 29:13.999
- That's okay.

29:13.999 --> 29:14.999
- Dad?

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
- Hey, Mom.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
Hey, how are you?

29:18.999 --> 29:20.999
- I'm great;
I just woke up, and James,

29:20.999 --> 29:24.999
Lala, and Faith decided to come
and surprise me.

29:24.999 --> 29:26.999
- We're here to take
care of him, Lisa.

29:30.999 --> 29:31.999
- I can't smile still.

29:31.999 --> 29:32.999
- He still can't smile,

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
but I think that's the numbing.

29:34.999 --> 29:35.999
That hasn't worn off yet either.

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
- No, Mom, don't worry about it.

29:41.999 --> 29:43.999
- Well, I don't know what
to tell you 'cause I'm fine.

29:45.999 --> 29:46.999
- What did she say?

29:46.999 --> 29:47.999
- She doesn't want
me to kiss you.

29:47.999 --> 29:49.999
- Ugh.

29:49.999 --> 29:52.999
- We're taking care of him.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
- I've tried to stop
worrying about Max,

29:54.999 --> 29:55.999
but it's hard, you know.

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
They're always your babies.

29:57.999 --> 29:58.999
- I love you, too, Mom.

29:58.999 --> 29:59.999
Bye.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.999
- Max needs to be recuperating.

30:02.999 --> 30:03.999
He doesn't need
to be at party central

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
with Jax and Tom in Hawaii.

30:05.999 --> 30:06.999
- I have to see the doctor
the same day...

30:06.999 --> 30:08.999
- Oh, no!
- As we're supposed to leave.

30:08.999 --> 30:09.999
I don't know
if I can go to Hawaii now.

30:09.999 --> 30:12.999
- Max is a critical part
in my master plan for Hawaii.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
Max is supposed to
be hooking up with Faith,

30:14.999 --> 30:15.999
leaving Lala alone for me.

30:15.999 --> 30:18.999
It's selfish to break your teeth
before going to Hawaii

30:19.000 --> 30:20.999
because of such plans.

30:20.999 --> 30:21.999
- Hi, Maria.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
- Yum, yum, yum!

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you!

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
- Oh, so good.
- You're amazing.

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
- Thank you.

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
- Oh, this is quite delightful.
- Yeah.

30:30.999 --> 30:33.999
- Sir Maxwell Todd.
- Yes, cheers.

30:33.999 --> 30:34.999
- Cheers, laddie.
- Cheers, yes.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.999
- Here's to getting better.
- Pinkies out.

30:36.999 --> 30:39.999
- I ran out of golden
toilet paper the other day,

30:39.999 --> 30:42.999
so I had to use the regular
kind that poor people use.

30:42.999 --> 30:43.999
- Stop, stop making me laugh.

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
Stop making me laugh.
- Isn't it funny being rich?

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
- Oh, my God.

30:49.999 --> 30:53.999
- I lost the battle
with some of the invites, so...

30:53.999 --> 30:56.999
You know, I personally
wouldn't have invited James.

30:56.999 --> 30:57.999
- It was nice of you.

30:57.999 --> 30:59.999
- Kind of sad, though,
when you have to like,

30:59.999 --> 31:00.999
ask someone if they
can come to your--

31:00.999 --> 31:02.999
- See, I--that's--no--
- If they, you what I mean?

31:02.999 --> 31:03.999
- That is exactly, that's--
- I wouldn't have been like,

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
"Can I come to your party?"

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
Like if you're not invited,
you're not invited.

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
- Sorry to interrupt you,
but yesterday

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
we went bikini shopping,
and Lala told me

31:10.999 --> 31:13.999
that James couldn't fit
in the Magnum condoms

31:13.999 --> 31:14.999
because they were
too big for him.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.999
- Shut up.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.999
- Oh, my God!

31:18.999 --> 31:19.999
- I feel like Lala's type

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
is anything with a dick,

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
regardless of
the shape, size, or color.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
- Yeah, she was quite
open yesterday, so...

31:29.000 --> 31:30.999
- James is in way over his head
with Lala.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
He can't handle that.

31:32.999 --> 31:33.999
- Apparently you have
to fit in Magnums

31:33.999 --> 31:36.999
in order to enter her.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
Yeah, you do.

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
Yeah!

31:39.999 --> 31:41.999
- She's not attracted to him.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
That's why she
hasn't had sex with him.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
- She also likes flirting
with other people's boyfriends.

31:45.999 --> 31:46.999
- Yeah, exactly.

31:46.999 --> 31:48.999
- So maybe just
an attention thing?

31:48.999 --> 31:52.999
- Girl is like on fire
right now, so...

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
- No, it warms up.

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
- Mm-mm-mm-mmm!

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
- Whoo!

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
- Mm-mm-mm-mmm.
- Come on!

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
- Uh-oh.
- Take it off.

32:04.999 --> 32:07.999
- I don't care if I'm at
my boss' swimming pool.

32:07.999 --> 32:09.999
If there is water,
my top is coming off.

32:09.999 --> 32:11.999
- Yeah, damn!

32:11.999 --> 32:12.999
She's killing it.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
- Max deserves to see

32:14.999 --> 32:15.999
booty and boobies.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
- Are you sure your
mom's not gonna mind?

32:17.999 --> 32:18.999
- She might mind a little bit.

32:18.999 --> 32:19.999
- It doesn't get much naughtier

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
than being in your
boss' swimming pool

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
with two half-naked girls,
when my boss' son

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
is meant to be
in the house, bedridden,

32:26.999 --> 32:27.999
recovering post-surgery.

32:27.999 --> 32:30.000
Well, we got to take advantage
of this while we got it.

32:30.999 --> 32:31.999
Look at this.

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
- Are you okay?
- This is ridiculous.

32:33.999 --> 32:34.999
- I'm doing it
'cause I'm still cold.

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999
I don't know why I'm still cold.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
- We're gonna take
four of these,

32:37.999 --> 32:38.999
and call me in the morning.

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
I feel better already.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
- I just spoke
to my doctor, right?

32:41.999 --> 32:43.000
Hey, I don't have to--
I don't have to be

32:43.999 --> 32:44.999
seeing him until Friday,
so I can go.

32:44.999 --> 32:46.999
- Ay!

32:46.999 --> 32:47.999
So you're coming?
- I'm coming, yeah.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.999
- Get him in the pool!

32:49.999 --> 32:50.999
- Coming up...

32:50.999 --> 32:51.999
- I just don't want it to be

32:51.999 --> 32:52.999
this thick tension anymore,

32:53.000 --> 32:54.999
because I'm going to be around.

32:54.999 --> 32:55.999
I'm not going anywhere.

33:05.999 --> 33:09.999
♪ You make so hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot ♪

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
- I'll get a tattoo in Hawaii.
- Really?

33:11.999 --> 33:12.999
- Yeah.
- Gonna get another one?

33:12.999 --> 33:16.000
You might as well,
you're the tattoo train now.

33:16.999 --> 33:17.999
Yeah, you bet, or Gordo.

33:17.999 --> 33:18.999
- Oh, Gordo.
- Gordo.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
- Gordo first, then Jax.
- Oh, yeah!

33:20.999 --> 33:21.999
- Yeah, he's gonna X out--
he's gonna--

33:21.999 --> 33:23.999
he's gonna--
he's gonna X out Bubba.

33:23.999 --> 33:24.999
- Oh, no.
- He's gonna exile Bubba.

33:24.999 --> 33:25.999
- I'll be right back.

33:25.999 --> 33:26.999
I'm gonna step out for a second.

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
Hi.

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
Can I borrow your lighter?

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
- Sure.

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
- I don't even know
the last time I talked to you.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
Like I cannot--

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
- Kristen,
just please, like,

33:50.999 --> 33:51.999
I just want you to be happy.

33:54.999 --> 33:55.999
I'm sorry--I'm sorry

33:55.999 --> 33:58.999
that we didn't work out.

33:58.999 --> 34:01.999
- So I'm not going
to Hawaii, obviously.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.999
You got your way.

34:03.999 --> 34:04.999
I don't know if it was
more of a you thing

34:04.999 --> 34:06.000
or an Ariana thing.

34:06.999 --> 34:07.999
- I mean, do you think
it's appropriate?

34:07.999 --> 34:11.000
- Jax is my friend, and I know
it's your birthday too,

34:11.999 --> 34:13.999
which is why I'm
talking to you about it,

34:13.999 --> 34:16.999
but it's like, I just don't
know what it's going to take

34:16.999 --> 34:20.999
for you to stop
making it so hard

34:20.999 --> 34:22.999
on Katie, Jax, and Scheana.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- This has less
to do with, like, you,

34:24.999 --> 34:26.999
and it has more to do
with the fact that, like,

34:27.000 --> 34:28.999
when it was brought up,

34:28.999 --> 34:31.999
it became this,
like, attack on me.

34:31.999 --> 34:33.999
Like, that I'm
weird for thinking

34:33.999 --> 34:34.999
that I don't want you there.

34:34.999 --> 34:35.999
Just because Kristen's

34:36.000 --> 34:37.999
been operating
behind the scenes on this

34:37.999 --> 34:40.999
doesn't mean that she's not
completely to blame.

34:40.999 --> 34:43.999
I mean, she could have
totally bowed out,

34:43.999 --> 34:46.999
but nope,
just kept on keeping on.

34:46.999 --> 34:47.999
Do you think Shay
could bring

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
one of his exes
on a f***ing trip?

34:50.999 --> 34:53.999
Like, it's not--it's just--
it's completely inappropriate.

34:53.999 --> 34:56.000
Your presence does
make me feel uncomfortable,

34:56.999 --> 34:58.999
and it makes Ariana
feel uncomfortable too.

34:58.999 --> 34:59.999
- Whoa, what is that?

34:59.999 --> 35:00.999
That looks so good.

35:00.999 --> 35:01.999
What is that?

35:01.999 --> 35:04.999
- Where's Kristen and Tom?

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
- Where are they?

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
- It's apology tour.

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
The only thing genuine about
Kristen's apology tour 2015

35:10.999 --> 35:13.999
is her desire to go
on this f***ing trip.

35:13.999 --> 35:16.999
How does no one else see it?

35:16.999 --> 35:17.999
- I just feel bad eating

35:17.999 --> 35:18.999
'cause all their
stuff is sitting here.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.999
- I didn't even notice
they were both gone.

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
I just noticed she was gone.
- Oh, God.

35:22.999 --> 35:23.999
Not on my birthday.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
- Like to be a fly
on the wall for that one.

35:25.999 --> 35:26.999
- No?
- Not really, actually.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
- So how is it gonna be
post-Hawaii then?

35:28.999 --> 35:31.999
Because I'm still
gonna be around.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
- Look, I don't know.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
- I was at Katie
and Schwartz' house yesterday.

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
I hated that I missed
their engagement.

35:37.999 --> 35:39.999
It's like missing out
on these, like, moments, and--

35:39.999 --> 35:40.999
- I've told them--

35:40.999 --> 35:41.999
- So when you guys
get back from Hawaii,

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
you realize there's gonna
be group settings.

35:43.999 --> 35:45.999
There's gonna parties,
there's gonna be things--

35:45.999 --> 35:48.999
- Kristen, I've accepted
that a long time ago.

35:48.999 --> 35:51.999
Kristen keeps bringing up all
this stuff about us

35:51.999 --> 35:55.999
in the future and the thing is,
is there is no us.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.999
All there is
is me tolerating you,

35:57.999 --> 36:00.999
and that's all
it's ever gonna be.

36:00.999 --> 36:02.999
- I just don't want it to be
this thick tension anymore

36:02.999 --> 36:04.999
because I'm going to be around;
I'm not going anywhere.

36:04.999 --> 36:06.000
- If it's a big situation--

36:06.999 --> 36:07.999
- Like, Katie and Tom
are getting married.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.999
You don't think I'm gonna
around for her engagement,

36:10.999 --> 36:12.000
her bachelorette party,
her wedding,

36:12.999 --> 36:14.999
planning all of this
with her?

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
- You're really gonna
plan this with her?

36:16.999 --> 36:17.999
- f*** yeah, I am.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Tom and Ariana need to wrap

36:20.999 --> 36:21.999
their little brains
around the fact

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
that I'm going
to be helping out

36:23.999 --> 36:24.999
and if they can
just accept it now,

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
they won't f*** it up
for Katie later.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
- You have to
understand that, like,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.999
there was a lot
of things done.

36:30.999 --> 36:33.999
Like, you did a lot of very
aggressive things.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
It's my fault!
- She is the ****

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
who hooked up with
my f***ing boyfriend.

36:39.999 --> 36:40.999
- Don't f***ing touch him!

36:40.999 --> 36:42.999
- I do wish she would get hit by

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
a Mack Truck or something.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.999
- This is real life, Kristen.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
Sometimes actions
have consequences.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.999
- I just--I just want this
to get a little bit easier.

36:51.999 --> 36:54.999
I respect your feelings,

36:54.999 --> 36:57.999
but I am gonna be around.

36:57.999 --> 36:59.999
Good talk, buddy.

37:12.999 --> 37:15.999
- I also want to talk
and make sure, you know?

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
- I just feel like maybe,
while Tom's not here.

37:17.999 --> 37:20.999
I'm just gonna pull
her just over there.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
When you're done glossing,

37:22.999 --> 37:23.999
do you want to come
meet me at the bar?

37:23.999 --> 37:26.999
- Sure.
- I'm coming too.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.999
- We keep losing people.
Where did they go?

37:30.999 --> 37:33.999
- They went to go
have a little chat with Ariana.

37:33.999 --> 37:34.999
- I ate one of your potatoes.

37:34.999 --> 37:35.999
- You can have another one.

37:35.999 --> 37:38.999
- I just felt talking
to you at Sur

37:38.999 --> 37:40.999
was not the best.

37:40.999 --> 37:43.999
I just--I feel like there's
been a lot of tension.

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
- Everything's fine.

37:44.999 --> 37:47.999
Like, today it's--
it's not a problem.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
- We both feel like
you've just been

37:49.999 --> 37:52.999
so extremely negative lately
and just angry all the time

37:53.000 --> 37:54.999
and bitchy and intimidating.

37:54.999 --> 37:56.999
- Kristen isn't going
anywhere in our lives,

37:56.999 --> 37:58.999
and I don't want you
and Tom to go anywhere,

37:58.999 --> 38:00.999
but I'm not saying either one
of you are Stassi or anything,

38:00.999 --> 38:02.999
but it just feels like
such a similar situation

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
where I feel I'm being backed
into a f***ing corner...

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
- And that's how we felt.
- And not given a choice.

38:06.999 --> 38:07.999
- We felt like we
were backed into a corner.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.999
- Yeah, but I don't
like hearing about

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
someone questioning
my integrity or my character

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
because I'm willing to forgive.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
I question people's
integrity and character

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
when they're not
willing to forgive.

38:16.999 --> 38:19.999
- All of you have hated Kristen
at one time or another.

38:19.999 --> 38:23.999
There's a reason why
I was never friends with her,

38:23.999 --> 38:26.000
and it's my integrity
and my character.

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
- Your mom had actually
reached out to me

38:28.999 --> 38:29.999
and asked if you were okay.

38:29.999 --> 38:31.999
And she didn't know if you
were unhappy with Tom

38:31.999 --> 38:33.999
and if he was a bad boyfriend.

38:33.999 --> 38:34.999
I'm just saying,
it's not just, like, us

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
making this up; like,
your own family has noticed

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
a change in your personality.

38:38.999 --> 38:40.999
- Are you f***ing kidding me?

38:40.999 --> 38:42.999
That really bothers me.

38:42.999 --> 38:44.999
That's not something
my mom would prompt.

38:44.999 --> 38:47.999
- I just wanted
to clear any tension

38:47.999 --> 38:49.999
that has been
surrounding us this week

38:49.999 --> 38:51.999
before we go to Hawaii, 'cause
I do want us all to have fun.

38:51.999 --> 38:54.999
- I can't believe we're
about to go to Hawaii

38:54.999 --> 38:57.999
and I'm about to get on
a plane with these ass****s

38:57.999 --> 39:01.999
who look a lot like people
who used to be my best friends.

39:01.999 --> 39:03.999
You do you,
but I'm just am gonna do

39:03.999 --> 39:04.999
what I have to do for me.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
- Ariana thinks she's
the cool, laid-back chick

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
and Kristen's the one
holding onto grudges,

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
but in reality,
it's the other way around.

39:12.999 --> 39:13.999
- I'm not going to put myself

39:13.999 --> 39:16.999
in a situation where
I feel uncomfortable.

39:18.999 --> 39:19.999
- Coming up...

39:19.999 --> 39:20.999
- Are you excited?

39:20.999 --> 39:22.999
I'm not really excited about

39:22.999 --> 39:23.999
certain people that are
being here, but...

39:23.999 --> 39:25.999
- Oh, my God.
I'm so ready!

39:38.999 --> 39:40.999
- Yay, LAX!

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
Yay, LAX!

39:42.999 --> 39:43.999
- Hey!

39:43.999 --> 39:45.000
- Baby!
- Hi!

39:45.999 --> 39:46.999
- Hi.
- What's up, mate?

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
- I'm just excited
to go back to Hawaii!

39:48.999 --> 39:49.999
- What, is this just your bag?

39:49.999 --> 39:51.999
I have two bags.
Look at this.

39:51.999 --> 39:52.999
I have room in both of them

39:52.999 --> 39:55.999
for, like,
a sword, you know?

39:55.999 --> 39:57.999
- Max failed.
You're on antibiotics.

39:57.999 --> 40:00.999
You're not allowed to drink
per your parents' orders.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.999
If you're gonna drink,
do not do it in front of me--

40:02.999 --> 40:03.999
- I'm not drinking
in front of you.

40:03.999 --> 40:04.999
- Are you excited?

40:04.999 --> 40:05.999
I'm not really excited about

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
certain people that are
being here, but...

40:07.999 --> 40:09.999
- Oh, my God.
I'm so ready!

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
- It wouldn't be the
worst thing in the world

40:11.999 --> 40:12.999
if James went missing
after the first day.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
Start a fight with a bouncer,
end up in jail.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
I'm just saying.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.999
- We're going to f***ing Hawaii.
- I know!

40:24.999 --> 40:26.999
- I couldn't be happier
that I got myself invited,

40:26.999 --> 40:27.999
because I'd want to f*** Lala,

40:27.999 --> 40:31.999
and what better place to do that
than Hawaii?

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
- Come on, dude.

40:34.999 --> 40:38.999
- I just hope that,
now that, you know,

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
we're past the whole
Kristen debacle

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
whether she's
coming or not coming...

40:44.999 --> 40:46.999
- I hope so,
'cause if she's Debbie Downer

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
the whole time then she's going
ruin everyone else's mood.

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
It's too bad Kristen
is not coming on this trip.

40:51.999 --> 40:54.999
Jax didn't get his way,
but Tom and Ariana are happy,

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
so I guess that's
all that matters.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
- I fully intend on
having an awesome time.

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
- I know, I'm excited.

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
- There are 14 of us,
which means

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
everywhere we go is a party.

41:15.999 --> 41:18.999
- ♪ Turn the music up
and let me sing ♪

41:18.999 --> 41:20.999

and do my thing ♪

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999

41:23.000 --> 41:27.999

I'm sposed to be ♪

41:28.999 --> 41:29.999
- Still to come on this season

41:29.999 --> 41:31.999

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
- Does my butt look good?

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
- Party central in Hawaii.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
Behave yourself
when you're all together.

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
It makes me nervous.

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
- You're obnoxious.
- Oh, f*** off.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.999
- You're taking your top off

41:42.999 --> 41:43.999
in front my fiancée.

41:43.999 --> 41:44.999
- They can kiss my ass.

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
- Lala is one
of the biggest teases

41:46.999 --> 41:47.999
I've ever met in my life.

41:47.999 --> 41:49.999
- We did not have
a successful f***!

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
Be honest!
- I've never said anything.

41:51.999 --> 41:52.999
- You're a good liar.
- This is not good.

41:52.999 --> 41:54.999
- Jax is not gonna
do anything stupid.

41:54.999 --> 41:55.999
- Jax just got arrested.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
- Where is he?
I want to f***ing kill him.

42:00.999 --> 42:02.999
Don't come into work ever again.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.999
- You guys have this

42:04.999 --> 42:05.999
"we're better than everyone"
attitude.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
- I've never acted
like I'm better

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever.

42:09.999 --> 42:10.999
- I got out-stubborned...

42:10.999 --> 42:11.999
- I f***ing move mountains!

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
- Out-bitched...
- I don't give a f***.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
- And I lost this war.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
- She should have been focusing

42:16.999 --> 42:17.999
on her own relationship.

42:17.999 --> 42:18.999
- You had quite a few drinks.

42:18.999 --> 42:19.999
- You're drunk now.

42:19.999 --> 42:20.999
- What should I do?

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
- You can't fix everyone.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.000
- You treated me like sh**.

42:24.999 --> 42:25.999
- I'm still in love with you.

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
- Sit the f*** down!
- All right, all right!

42:27.999 --> 42:29.999
- I'm the white
f***ing Kanye West.

42:29.999 --> 42:30.999
- Your ego is out of control.

42:30.999 --> 42:32.999
Go away
and grow the f*** up.

42:32.999 --> 42:35.999
- I just don't know
if I can make the commitment.

42:35.999 --> 42:37.999
I feel like I'm either all in
with this or I'm all out.

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999
- Get a f***ing job!

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
- f***, I can't believe
I almost married you.

42:40.999 --> 42:42.999
- I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you.

42:42.999 --> 42:43.999
Go f*** yourself and die.

42:43.999 --> 42:45.999
- You and I can just team up,

42:45.999 --> 42:46.999
be like, "f*** everybody."

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
- There's something
to be said for history.

42:48.999 --> 42:49.999
- Hi, hello.
- Hi, Jax, hi.

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
- Jax and Stassi.

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
It's match made
in bloody heaven.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
- Swallowing my pride
is the worst.

42:54.999 --> 42:57.999
- You are a f***ing bitch!

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
- I regret cutting her out
so quickly.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
- Now you're back
from the dead.

43:01.999 --> 43:02.999
It's too little,
too late.

43:02.999 --> 43:04.999
- So I am going to go see Lisa.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.999
- That's gonna suck.

43:05.999 --> 43:06.999
- Hi, Lisa.

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
- You had a boss,
and you had a good friend,

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
and you f***ed it up.
