[Ding]

00:11.000 --> 00:12.959
You're much more
attractive than she is.

00:12.959 --> 00:15.333
You are.
She's so plastic.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.125
Those boobs.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.291
Yuck.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.875
I think it's nice
you've made a new
titsy friend.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.834
She's obviously
quite fond of you.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.709
She's an actress
who wants more lines.

00:26.709 --> 00:28.000
Maybe she can
hug them out of you.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.500
Hey!
Yes!

00:29.500 --> 00:33.458
[Laughter]
Aww.

00:33.458 --> 00:37.166
[Laughing]

00:37.166 --> 00:39.333
Ohh!

01:33.291 --> 01:35.000
No. No.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.667
Oh, good.
There you are.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.083
Hey. See what
Sean thinks.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.000
See what Sean thinks
about what?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.750
Isn't this top
too booby for Nicola?

01:41.750 --> 01:43.917
Uh...

01:43.917 --> 01:46.125
I'd--I'd have to say,
can one ever be
too booby?

01:46.125 --> 01:48.792
Thank you! I have
spent a lot of money

01:48.792 --> 01:50.917
believing the answer
to that question is no.

01:50.917 --> 01:52.792
I'm gonna find you
something else.

01:52.792 --> 01:55.375
So, what's up?
Um...

01:57.250 --> 01:58.959
Thanks.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.166
I've got the new pages
for the library scene.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.375
You go to him now.
That way,

02:06.375 --> 02:09.458
it really puts
the pressure on him.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.250
Let's see.

02:13.417 --> 02:16.083
[Laughs]

02:23.417 --> 02:25.250
This is so much better.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.959
Is it? Oh, yay.
Yeah, it works now.

02:27.959 --> 02:31.041
You're so good!
[Laughs]

02:31.041 --> 02:32.291
Well...

02:36.041 --> 02:38.166
Morning likes
the rewrite.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.250
I can see that.

02:48.959 --> 02:51.333
I should probably--
Right.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.375
Try this.

02:55.917 --> 02:58.208
What was I
supposed to do?

02:58.208 --> 03:00.208
I'm talking to her,
and she just takes
her top off

03:00.208 --> 03:02.083
like I'm not
even there.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.333
Oh, please. She knew
you were there.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.291
She's an actress.
They're very free
with their bodies.

03:07.291 --> 03:10.166
All I'm saying is,
that was a choice.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.792
She could've gone
in the back to change.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.667
Or--here's an idea--

03:13.667 --> 03:15.959
she could just have
turned round. But no.

03:15.959 --> 03:17.417
She decided that was
the perfect moment

03:17.417 --> 03:19.166
to bring out
the bazooms.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.583
Bazooms?
Yes.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.667
Technically,
those aren't breasts.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.166
They're bazooms.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.000
You can look it up in
The Big Book of Tits.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.500
Darling, look at me.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.375
Hi. You have
nothing to worry about.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.583
I am totally immune
to her bazooms.

03:34.583 --> 03:35.625
All right.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.041
I mean it.

03:37.041 --> 03:38.000
I said all right.
All right.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.083
All right?
All right.

03:39.083 --> 03:40.333
One more round?

03:40.333 --> 03:42.250
All right.
All right.

03:43.542 --> 03:45.333
[Groans]

03:46.667 --> 03:48.250
Is today over yet?

03:48.250 --> 03:51.208
Actually,
Matt has these tickets

03:51.208 --> 03:53.291
for this charity
thing tonight,
and he was wondering--

03:53.291 --> 03:55.208
Oh, please, no.
All I want to do

03:55.208 --> 03:57.166
is go home and sit
in a nice hot bath.

03:57.166 --> 03:58.625
Can we get out of it?

03:58.625 --> 04:00.208
You can.
He only has one extra.

04:00.208 --> 04:02.542
And, of course,
he only invited you.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.208
You just said
you didn't want to go.

04:04.208 --> 04:06.000
That's not the point.
It's my point.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.542
What if I wanted to go?
But you don't.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.041
You just asked
to get out of it.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.834
Whoosh--you're out of it.
Any more wishes?

04:10.834 --> 04:12.458
Are you being
intentionally dim,

04:12.458 --> 04:13.750
or do you really
not get--

04:13.750 --> 04:15.333
It's you who
doesn't get it.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.250
Of course he's not gonna
invite you to things.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.083
He knows you didn't
want him for the part.

04:19.083 --> 04:21.333
You talk to him
like he's an idiot.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.709
And, lest we forget,
you hate him.

04:23.709 --> 04:26.250
Still, that's no reason
not to invite me.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.166
Yeah, yeah.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.458
So, what is this
charity thing that
I'm not invited to?

04:30.458 --> 04:31.750
It's for rape.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.083
It's for rape?

04:33.083 --> 04:34.709
No, it's not
for rape.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.750
It's not--
It's not pro-rape.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.625
It's to prevent it,
or to...

04:38.625 --> 04:40.875
take care of women
after--

04:40.875 --> 04:42.291
I don't know.
Rape is involved.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.166
You wouldn't have
enjoyed it anyway.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.792
There's this whole
wine-tasting thing.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.959
Wine-tasting and rape?

04:47.959 --> 04:50.083
And I believe
there's a singer.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.333
Uh...

04:54.041 --> 04:55.625
Oh, good.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.250
She's here.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.125
What do you think?

05:04.125 --> 05:05.625
Well, uh...

05:05.625 --> 05:08.625
I like that she's
wearing a top
this time.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.000
Mm-hmm?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.959
But where's the bottom?

05:11.959 --> 05:14.000
What are you saying?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.875
Uh, the skirt.
What?

05:15.875 --> 05:17.625
Too short?

05:17.625 --> 05:18.959
Heh.

05:18.959 --> 05:20.709
She's a librarian

05:20.709 --> 05:23.125
in a boys'
boarding school.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.583
I'm guessing
it's not within
her job description

05:24.583 --> 05:26.542
to show the boys
her vagina.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.875
They might go to
the library more.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.417
Look at it
with the glasses.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.750
Hmm?

05:34.750 --> 05:39.000
Right. So, now it's
a vagina with glasses.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Tell me again...
what you want.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.250
Obviously,
I'm not getting it.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.291
As incomprehensible
as that is,

05:47.291 --> 05:50.333
we need something
tasteful, stylish,

05:50.333 --> 05:53.250
less, uh...
gynecological.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.834
CAROL: Hey, kids!

05:54.834 --> 05:57.542
Ohh! Love that!

05:57.542 --> 05:58.917
Thank you!

05:58.917 --> 06:00.208
Isn't it great?

06:00.208 --> 06:01.542
It is not great!

06:01.542 --> 06:04.208
Because she's
a librarian!

06:04.208 --> 06:06.583
Well, a TV librarian.
Exactly.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.125
Meaning?

06:08.125 --> 06:09.959
No one ever stopped
watching a TV show

06:09.959 --> 06:11.709
because the librarian
looked too hot.

06:11.709 --> 06:14.000
You're not gonna
actually see my vagina.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.709
And yet, we'll all
know it's there.

06:17.709 --> 06:20.333
[Laughs] Look,
let me be absolutely
clear about this.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.625
This skirt--and her
reproductive organs--

06:22.625 --> 06:27.166
are not--I repeat--
not going in my show!

06:28.667 --> 06:30.625
Let's get you
out of this, honey...

06:30.625 --> 06:33.000
before she kills
somebody.

06:36.208 --> 06:39.333
I'm--I'm sorry.
That was--

06:39.333 --> 06:41.667
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.125
No, I'm fine, really.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.500
I know, I know.
Just walk with me.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.792
Okay, what's wrong?

06:55.792 --> 06:57.709
Nothing's wrong.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.625
Really, it's all good.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.333
Gotcha. Nice fists.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.875
Oh. Oh, it's all
incredibly tedious.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.625
So, bore me.

07:08.625 --> 07:11.750
Oh, I've just had
a rather difficult day.

07:11.750 --> 07:14.083
And by "day", I mean
month, month and a half.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.750
Oh. Not having fun?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.917
Fun?

07:18.917 --> 07:21.542
No. I--

07:21.542 --> 07:23.750
You really want
to hear this?

07:23.750 --> 07:25.542
Yeah, I really do.

07:33.917 --> 07:36.959
[Sighs]

07:36.959 --> 07:39.417
Every day, I...

07:39.417 --> 07:41.625
feel like we're making
this show worse.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.125
I can barely remember
why I liked it
to begin with.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.625
I hate L.A.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.041
I'm sick of the sunshine
and the mojitos.

07:49.041 --> 07:51.959
I--I am tired
of feeling fat

07:51.959 --> 07:53.792
when I'm not fat.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.000
You're not fat.
Thank you!

07:57.875 --> 07:59.125
Am I fat?

07:59.125 --> 08:01.291
No! You're not fat!

08:01.291 --> 08:04.542
Really?
Ohh, I hate my ass.

08:04.542 --> 08:07.667
I used to have
such a great ass.

08:09.041 --> 08:11.041
So...we're done
with me?

08:11.041 --> 08:12.792
Oh, sorry.
Ha ha ha!

08:12.792 --> 08:14.625
Go on.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.625
Sean would kill me
for saying this,

08:16.625 --> 08:19.917
but if you told me right now
this whole thing was off,

08:19.917 --> 08:22.583
oh, I'd be home
in a heartbeat,

08:22.583 --> 08:24.709
and I wouldn't
mind a bit.

08:24.709 --> 08:27.834
But you're not gonna
tell me that, are you?

08:27.834 --> 08:29.166
Sorry.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.834
Good night, Tim.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.750
Oh, Christ.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.959
See you guys tomorrow.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.000
Honey...

08:40.000 --> 08:41.792
it's gonna be all right.

08:42.959 --> 08:45.041
We'll find a skirt.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.834
I know we will.

08:47.834 --> 08:49.625
CAROL: Look at you,
all glamory.

08:49.625 --> 08:50.917
Thanks.

08:50.917 --> 08:52.166
You did that fast.

08:52.166 --> 08:53.834
What are you up to
tonight?

08:53.834 --> 08:56.083
I've got that benefit for
the rape prevention thingy.

08:56.083 --> 08:59.125
Oh, um...I believe
Sean's gonna be there.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.291
Yeah, I know.
We'll miss you.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.166
Night.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.333
I didn't see him behind me

09:11.333 --> 09:13.792
until it was too late.

09:13.792 --> 09:17.208
He hit me with
a piece of pipe,

09:17.208 --> 09:19.208
and before I could scream,

09:19.208 --> 09:21.208
he had his hand
over my mouth.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.542
But mine was--

09:23.542 --> 09:25.959
[Whispers] I once
did a pilot with her.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.208
Hmm.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.834
Not a good actress.

09:30.834 --> 09:34.208
...18% of all victims
were raped by a stranger.

09:34.208 --> 09:39.333
82% were attacked by
someone that they know.

09:39.333 --> 09:43.083
I think she does
voice-overs now.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.208
For, like, cartoons and shit.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.083
...and why your support

09:47.083 --> 09:49.750
is so vitally important.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.750
Women have to know how
to protect themselves...

09:52.750 --> 09:54.917
You want to open
the wine?

09:56.250 --> 09:58.375
I think we're
supposed to wait.

09:58.375 --> 10:01.000
I am also speaking here
as a mother...

10:01.000 --> 10:02.917
It really should breathe.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.208
All right.
Okay.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.250
Over 80% of the women

10:06.250 --> 10:10.792
who report being raped
are under 25 years old.

10:10.792 --> 10:15.417
And that's just the instances
that have been reported.

10:15.417 --> 10:18.041
Rape is called the most
under-reported...

10:18.041 --> 10:20.583
[Cork squeaking]

10:20.583 --> 10:23.917
In a large national survey
of American women...

10:23.917 --> 10:25.125
[Pop]

10:25.125 --> 10:27.083
[Sighs loudly]

10:27.083 --> 10:28.458
...was reported
to the police.

10:28.458 --> 10:31.625
Think about that.
One in six.

10:31.625 --> 10:34.125
That is a staggering
statistic...

10:34.125 --> 10:35.959
Hi.
Hey.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.750
Hey.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.125
Sorry I'm late.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.250
I got stuck in wardrobe.

10:40.250 --> 10:41.458
What'd I miss?

10:41.458 --> 10:44.583
She was raped.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.834
...and college campuses,
teaching young women

10:46.834 --> 10:48.375
how to defend themselves...

10:48.375 --> 10:49.834
I didn't know
you were coming.

10:49.834 --> 10:52.208
Matt invited me.
You look very nice.

10:52.208 --> 10:55.208
Shh! Come on, guys.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.000
Not cool.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.375
WOMAN: We guide them
through the process

10:59.375 --> 11:01.000
of going to the proper
authorities,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.750
and we are providing
counseling...

11:05.542 --> 11:08.375
It's crazy. Why am I
even worrying about this?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.166
I completely trust him.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.458
The question is,
do you trust her?

11:12.458 --> 11:15.875
About as far
as I can stretch
her tight little face.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.834
I don't even like
her name--Morning.

11:18.834 --> 11:22.041
Well, imagine
how ridiculous
that name will be

11:22.041 --> 11:24.000
when she's, like, 70.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.458
She probably is 70.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.250
[Laughs]
How does she do it?

11:28.250 --> 11:30.750
I've heard injections.
What sort?

11:30.750 --> 11:33.208
Some kind of serum made
from Chinese babies.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.166
Oh, that's horrible.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.166
Do we know
where she gets it?

11:37.166 --> 11:38.792
[Laughs]

11:40.166 --> 11:42.000
Do you smoke?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.834
Ohh, I'd love one.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.917
But I quit
ten years ago.

11:45.917 --> 11:48.208
Although, I did slip
the other day,

11:48.208 --> 11:49.834
and it was--

11:49.834 --> 11:52.208
No, no, I shouldn't.
I know it's poison.

11:52.208 --> 11:55.250
And yet, sometimes even
the smell of a cigarette--

11:55.250 --> 11:57.208
Oh. Not cigarettes.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.667
Oh, that's fine.

12:00.291 --> 12:03.542
â™ª I'm just a fool
who needs to listen to... â™ª

12:03.542 --> 12:06.375
I didn't know
you'd invited her.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.083
MATT: Yeah.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.291
Wait, are you two--

12:11.291 --> 12:13.333
Us? No, no.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.917
I brought her for you.
Ha ha!

12:15.917 --> 12:17.667
And I didn't
get you anything.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.959
It just seemed like you guys
were really hitting it off,

12:19.959 --> 12:22.083
so I thought I'd
give you some space--

12:22.083 --> 12:24.166
you know, away from--
ehhhh!

12:24.166 --> 12:25.333
You serious?

12:25.333 --> 12:27.041
Yeah, I think
she likes you.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.875
First of all,
I'm married, happily.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.417
I don't do
that sort of thing.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.917
And whether
she likes me--

12:32.917 --> 12:34.583
Why do you think
she likes me?

12:34.583 --> 12:36.792
I'm telling you--
the way she's always...

12:36.792 --> 12:38.583
playing up to you.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.250
That's not
what that is.
I'm her boss.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.291
It's my show.
She has to be
nice to me.

12:42.291 --> 12:45.041
I'm not nice
to your wife.

12:46.542 --> 12:48.583
Even so,
it doesn't matter.
I don't cheat.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.083
Who said anything
about cheating?

12:52.083 --> 12:54.417
I'm talking about
a little thing.

12:54.417 --> 12:56.875
Yeah, a little thing
is still a thing.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.250
Nah.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.166
Like, is a hand job
cheating?

13:03.166 --> 13:04.667
Yes.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.667
A hand job?
Yes.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.291
You know what
a hand job is?
Yes.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.458
So, I guess a blow job--
All the jobs are cheating.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.458
Hand job, blow job,

13:15.458 --> 13:17.208
hum job, rim job...

13:17.208 --> 13:19.667
Oh, stop.
You're turning me on
with that accent.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.125
Ooh!
I'm just saying--

13:22.125 --> 13:23.834
look at what
you're giving up.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.792
You've seen the tape.
What tape?

13:27.792 --> 13:29.458
You haven't seen
her tape?

13:29.458 --> 13:31.750
Morning?
Uh, yeah.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.917
About ten years ago.
It was kind of a big deal,

13:33.917 --> 13:37.375
'cause she was playing
the mom on some family show.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.667
It's her and some
black dude,

13:38.667 --> 13:42.333
and they
are doing stuff.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.458
Oh, my God.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.625
I don't want
to see it.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.834
Ohh, you want
to see it.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.291
How long have you guys
been together?

13:56.291 --> 13:57.542
Eight years.

13:57.542 --> 13:59.667
And he's never...

13:59.667 --> 14:02.709
What?
Screwed around.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.834
Oh, no, never.

14:04.834 --> 14:07.625
Although...
Hmm?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.333
There is some precedent.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.625
Intriguing.

14:13.625 --> 14:17.500
When I first met Sean,
he was...

14:17.500 --> 14:19.750
married to someone else.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.417
Really?!

14:22.417 --> 14:25.250
We both got hired
to, um...

14:25.250 --> 14:27.709
write on
this sketch show,

14:27.709 --> 14:29.792
and from day one,
it was, like...

14:29.792 --> 14:32.792
"Hell-o-o-o-o.
Where have you been?"

14:32.792 --> 14:36.792
We totally clicked,
made each other laugh.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.291
And I told myself
nothing could happen.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.709
He was married.

14:39.709 --> 14:42.375
How long did that last?
Five days.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.834
Look at you,
with the self-restraint!

14:44.834 --> 14:47.083
[Laughs]

14:47.083 --> 14:50.083
Ohh. You want more?

14:50.083 --> 14:51.834
No. Yes.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.959
It was a crazy time--

14:54.959 --> 14:56.959
both of us
feeling guilty,

14:56.959 --> 14:58.625
sneaking around,

14:58.625 --> 14:59.875
always afraid we were
gonna get caught.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.583
That sounds hot.

15:01.583 --> 15:04.166
Oh, my God.
[Laughs]

15:06.875 --> 15:08.375
[Sighs]

15:08.375 --> 15:10.250
I've been seeing
this guy--

15:10.250 --> 15:12.709
also married.

15:12.709 --> 15:14.834
Ohh.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.041
No one knows.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.333
And...

15:19.333 --> 15:20.917
I can't tell you
his name.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.667
If it got out,

15:22.667 --> 15:25.083
it could ruin
a lot of lives.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.750
It's Merc, right?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.125
Yeah.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.583
Ohh! Hello, boys.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.625
Look, honey,
it's Matt LeBlanc

15:38.625 --> 15:40.750
and his pal...
Chim Chim Cher-ee!

15:40.750 --> 15:42.709
Ha ha ha!
Hi, Matt.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.917
Hello, Sean.
Hey.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.834
Wow, I didn't know
you two were gonna
be here.

15:46.834 --> 15:48.542
Are you kidding me?

15:48.542 --> 15:50.458
James is the co-chair
of this whole thing.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.750
Congratulations.
Wow.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.083
Yeah, she's
pretty amazing.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.750
She's been working
her ass off.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.667
For, like,
the last six months,

15:57.667 --> 15:59.792
all I've heard is,
"Rape, rape, rape,
rape, rape."

15:59.792 --> 16:01.959
It's enough to make you
want to do it.

16:01.959 --> 16:03.667
Honey.
I'm kidding.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.625
Hey, you don't laugh
at this stuff.

16:05.625 --> 16:06.792
You cry.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.625
It's a great night.
Thank you.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.208
It really is--everything.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.542
The wine, Natalie Cole.
Even the food.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.125
You don't expect it
to be good at these
things, but--

16:14.125 --> 16:16.625
I know. This chef
is a genius.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.542
I found him at the
colorectal cancer benefit.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.792
Now I won't use
anyone else.

16:19.792 --> 16:21.750
Have you ever been
to the colorectal one?

16:21.750 --> 16:23.458
[Laughs]
Oh, my God.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.709
They always do it
right around Christmas,

16:25.709 --> 16:27.417
with all
the twinkly lights.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.917
It's just magical.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.875
Well...

16:30.875 --> 16:33.041
I also really like
the one for the kids
with the harelips.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.709
Last year at the raffle,
I won a car.

16:35.709 --> 16:38.375
Wow.
Well, a Toyota.
But still.

16:38.375 --> 16:39.750
Is Beverly here?

16:39.750 --> 16:41.709
No, Matt only had
one extra ticket.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.166
Oh, you should've
called me.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.792
Uhh, I wish
I'd known.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.208
I really like Beverly.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.792
Yeah, she's great.

16:47.792 --> 16:49.917
Is she enjoying L.A.
any better?

16:49.917 --> 16:52.667
Eh. Well, you know,
we're working so hard
on the pilot,

16:52.667 --> 16:53.875
we really could
be anywhere.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.792
Hey, is this one
pushing you too hard?

16:55.792 --> 16:58.125
Just tell me. I've got
a bit of clout with him.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.667
Honey?

17:02.667 --> 17:04.041
Honey?

17:05.750 --> 17:07.208
Honey?

17:10.125 --> 17:13.083
He was going
to leave her...

17:13.083 --> 17:15.083
after Christmas.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.667
He just wanted to wait

17:16.667 --> 17:18.208
until they got back
from Hawaii.

17:18.208 --> 17:21.875
Apparently the deposits
weren't refundable,

17:21.875 --> 17:23.959
or some bullshit.
I don't know.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.750
But he really was
going to leave her.

17:27.750 --> 17:30.625
And then she went blind.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.667
Right.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.208
Obviously, he couldn't
do anything then.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.709
No.

17:36.709 --> 17:39.166
I mean,
how would that look?

17:39.166 --> 17:41.041
Not good.

17:41.041 --> 17:44.709
I couldn't believe it.

17:44.709 --> 17:47.208
Blind.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.458
Blind.

17:49.458 --> 17:54.000
It's like I was
being punished.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.500
Okay.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.417
And now it's--

17:59.417 --> 18:02.709
Ohh, it's just back to
where we were, you know?

18:02.709 --> 18:04.792
Screwing in the office

18:04.792 --> 18:06.792
and taking
fake business trips.

18:06.792 --> 18:11.000
I know, I know--
I should just end it.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.250
But--

18:13.250 --> 18:15.917
Oh, God.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.917
I could eat...

18:17.917 --> 18:21.750
a whole pig right now.

18:21.750 --> 18:25.291
You want to hear
something really pathetic?

18:27.333 --> 18:29.542
I've actually
become an expert

18:29.542 --> 18:31.750
on ocular blindness.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.375
I'm online constantly,

18:34.375 --> 18:36.750
reading all
the latest research.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.458
And so far,

18:38.458 --> 18:41.792
there is really no hope.

18:41.792 --> 18:44.041
But I--

18:44.041 --> 18:47.792
[Crying] I just
keep dreaming that...

18:47.792 --> 18:53.375
someday,
some doctor somewhere

18:53.375 --> 18:56.792
will find a cure

18:56.792 --> 19:00.458
and give that poor woman
her sight back,

19:00.458 --> 19:04.083
so he can fucking
leave her.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.083
[Laughs]

19:16.375 --> 19:18.166
Mmm. Ooh.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.500
You guys gotta
try this one.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.792
Starts off with,
like, a deep
cocoa flavor,

19:23.792 --> 19:26.375
and then
it has an almost
ashy finish.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.792
A what?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.125
An ashy finish.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.000
That's a real thing.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.166
[French accent] Mmm, yes.
It's a bright Cabernet,

19:34.166 --> 19:38.417
redolent of burnt hair
and, uh, Marlboro Lights.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.208
Or you can both
suck my balls.

19:40.208 --> 19:41.667
MAN: Sean?

19:41.667 --> 19:43.291
Oh, my God!

19:43.291 --> 19:45.834
What are you doing
here in L.A.?

19:45.834 --> 19:47.291
I've got a screenplay.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.875
What, you're
writing now?

19:48.875 --> 19:51.291
Pretending to.
That's brilliant.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.000
Although, features--
that is a tough game.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.500
Bev and I
have a script

19:55.500 --> 19:57.417
we've been trying
to make happen
for eight years.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.166
Actually,
mine is happening.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.667
What?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.333
We start filming
in three weeks.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.000
That's brilliant.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.834
They're making
your movie.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.458
Bryan Singer's directing.
Brilliant, brilliant.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.208
It's a two-hander
with Matt Damon
and Keira Knightley.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.959
[Laughs]
Matt Damon?!

20:13.959 --> 20:16.083
And Keira Knightley?

20:16.083 --> 20:18.333
In your movie.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.667
That's--

20:19.667 --> 20:22.208
That is--

20:23.375 --> 20:24.458
Brilliant?

20:24.458 --> 20:26.083
Oh, yeah, sorry.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.542
Matt LeBlanc,
Morning Randolph,

20:27.542 --> 20:30.125
this is
Andrew Leslie.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.041
Andrew used to be
our old P.A.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.667
But now, apparently,

20:33.667 --> 20:35.625
he's got a mo-o-ovie!

20:35.625 --> 20:37.375
So, what brings
you here?

20:37.375 --> 20:39.458
Uh, we're doing
a TV pilot.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.542
We're making
an American version
of  Lyman's Boys.

20:41.542 --> 20:43.583
Awesome. Who's doing
Julian's part?

20:43.583 --> 20:45.041
Matt is.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.166
[Laughs]

20:49.625 --> 20:51.667
Oh, you're serious?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.083
Well, that--
that's fantastic.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.709
Yeah, we changed it
a bit.

20:55.709 --> 20:57.125
It's now about
a hockey coach.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.583
It's cled  Pucks!

20:58.583 --> 21:00.375
[Laughs]
No, really.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.417
No, really.

21:02.417 --> 21:03.750
Wow.

21:03.750 --> 21:06.250
Well, good luck
with that.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.750
Uh, I should really
get back to Keira.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.166
Oh. You're here
with Keira?

21:11.166 --> 21:12.709
Mm. And all
the Paramount people.

21:12.709 --> 21:13.834
[Snores]

21:13.834 --> 21:16.333
Uh, nice meeting
you both.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.500
Bye-bye.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.792
Fuck you. Get out
of my country.

21:28.792 --> 21:31.583
Ohh! What kind of
sick mind

21:31.583 --> 21:33.417
chains a refrigerator?

21:33.417 --> 21:36.291
It's like locusts
came through here.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.917
Ohh, there's got
to be something left.

21:42.625 --> 21:46.417
Ohh. Hello.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.500
A donut.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.583
From the garbage?

21:50.583 --> 21:52.500
Yeah.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.792
Anything touching it?

21:54.792 --> 21:57.583
Just...garbage.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.792
All right.
Hey.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.417
[Both moaning]

22:04.417 --> 22:06.750
Three years ago,
he's getting me lattes.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.667
Now he's making
a movie with Matt Damon
and Keira Knightley.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.208
You know, just because
he's making a movie

22:12.208 --> 22:15.333
doesn't mean it's
gonna be a good movie.
Believe me.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.834
Why should I care
about this?

22:16.834 --> 22:18.625
He's not a bad person.

22:18.625 --> 22:20.500
He's a douchebag.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.625
Look, don't do this
to yourself.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.417
You'll still be making
great TV shows

22:25.417 --> 22:27.250
when that little
creep goes back

22:27.250 --> 22:28.834
to getting
other people coffee.

22:28.834 --> 22:33.333
You are a brilliant,
brilliant writer.

22:33.333 --> 22:36.083
And I don't mean "brilliant"
like you guys say it.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.041
You're actually brilliant.

22:38.041 --> 22:39.917
That's--
That's very kind.

22:39.917 --> 22:43.333
Bullshit. It's not kind.
It's true.

22:43.333 --> 22:46.375
You may not realize how
long I've been doing this.

22:46.375 --> 22:49.458
I've...heard rumors.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.834
So, you know I know
what I'm talking about.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.417
Before I took this,

22:53.417 --> 22:56.250
I watched every episode
of  Lyman's Boys.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.875
You did?

22:57.875 --> 22:59.709
Do you even know
how talented you are?

22:59.709 --> 23:02.291
I show up at
that stage every day,

23:02.291 --> 23:06.041
and I can't believe
I get to work with you.

23:22.834 --> 23:24.375
Well, boys, this is me.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.959
Oh, thank you both
for a lovely evening.

23:25.959 --> 23:27.792
Good night, sweetie.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.583
Come here.

23:34.458 --> 23:35.959
You gonna be okay?

23:35.959 --> 23:37.375
Oh, I--I--

23:37.375 --> 23:39.583
I'm already okay.
Thank you.

23:40.792 --> 23:43.041
See you tomorrow.

23:44.792 --> 23:47.667
There goes one great
opportunity.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.125
[Sighs]

23:52.917 --> 23:55.917
And it's back.
It's not my car.

23:55.917 --> 23:58.291
That was embarrassing.

23:58.291 --> 24:01.709
Oh, God. I'm covered
in dog hair--

24:01.709 --> 24:04.000
MATT: Whoa. Okay.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.375
I'm thinking
maybe you shouldn't
be driving tonight.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.583
I think you may be right.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.458
You're in Westwood,
right?

24:10.458 --> 24:12.083
Seanie, you're heading
in that direction.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.083
Would you mind?

24:14.083 --> 24:16.917
Um--

24:18.667 --> 24:21.125
Uh, actually, I need to
go back to the office.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.625
I left some
script notes there

24:22.625 --> 24:25.917
that Beverly and I
need to go over tonight.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.333
Oh. Okay.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.250
Come on.
I'll take you.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.041
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar.

24:42.041 --> 24:43.792
[Door closes]

24:45.208 --> 24:46.792
Hello.

24:46.792 --> 24:48.083
Mmm!

24:48.083 --> 24:50.667
[Chuckles]

24:50.667 --> 24:51.959
Mmm.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.834
Mmm-mmm. M.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.750
Moo shu pork.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.250
Moo shu pork to you.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.625
How was your bath?
Didn't get to it...

24:59.625 --> 25:02.834
because I got stoned
with Carol.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.125
Carol from the network?

25:04.125 --> 25:07.166
You did not!
Yes, I did.

25:07.166 --> 25:10.000
Your little wine-tasting
doesn't look so debauched
now, does it?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.875
It does not.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.834
What's in the bag?
Oh.

25:13.834 --> 25:16.500
We all got one.
I haven't looked in it yet.

25:19.041 --> 25:20.667
Corkscrew.

25:20.667 --> 25:23.208
Bottle of Merlot.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.333
And a rape whistle.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.667
So, how was it?
Who was there?
Any famouses?

25:31.667 --> 25:33.250
The place was
crawling with them.

25:33.250 --> 25:34.834
I was two tables away
from Sharon Stone,

25:34.834 --> 25:36.291
who was annoying
even from the back.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.041
Sure.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.250
Miley Cyrus, I think.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.750
Hmm!

25:40.750 --> 25:43.000
Elton John--
who, in person,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.834
looked a lot
like Judi Dench.

25:44.834 --> 25:46.458
[Laughs]
Really? Who else?

25:46.458 --> 25:48.208
Oh, I ran into
our old P.A. Andrew.

25:48.208 --> 25:50.208
Oh, little baby Andrew!

25:50.208 --> 25:52.208
Ohh, what's he
doing here?

25:52.208 --> 25:53.875
He wrote a movie
they're making

25:53.875 --> 25:55.583
with Matt Damon
and Keira Knightley.

25:55.583 --> 25:58.000
That little prick.
Thank you.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.709
Any other
familiar faces?

25:59.709 --> 26:01.709
Oh, Merc and his wife.
What's her name?

26:01.709 --> 26:03.000
Jamie.
Right. She says hello.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.959
Oh, that was sweet.

26:04.959 --> 26:07.166
So, that was it?

26:09.875 --> 26:11.709
What was it?

26:11.709 --> 26:13.792
Anybody else
I might know?

26:13.792 --> 26:15.333
Uh, no.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.917
Well...Matt?

26:18.917 --> 26:20.375
Oh, Matt.
Right, of course.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.375
And...

26:22.375 --> 26:24.375
And that's it.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.917
[Coughs]

26:25.917 --> 26:28.250
Really? No one else?

26:28.250 --> 26:30.875
Uh...

26:30.875 --> 26:32.875
I don't think so.

26:32.875 --> 26:34.959
Not, um...

26:34.959 --> 26:36.125
Morning?

26:36.125 --> 26:38.583
Oh, right.
Yeah, Morning.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.083
What?

26:41.083 --> 26:43.166
No, I just...

26:43.166 --> 26:44.458
think it's interesting

26:44.458 --> 26:46.083
that you failed
to mention her.

26:46.083 --> 26:48.000
Guess I forgot.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.583
You remember someone who
may have been Miley Cyrus,

26:50.583 --> 26:52.917
but you forgot one of
the stars of our show?

26:52.917 --> 26:55.542
All right, fine.
The reason I didn't
mention her

26:55.542 --> 26:59.250
was because I knew it
would make you all--

26:59.250 --> 27:00.834
whatever you're
being now.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.458
I'm whatever
I'm being now

27:02.458 --> 27:04.125
because you didn't
mention her.

27:04.125 --> 27:06.458
Nothing happened.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.375
You say that like there's
a chance something
could've happened.

27:08.375 --> 27:10.291
All right, fine.
You want to know
the truth?

27:10.291 --> 27:12.125
As opposed to what?

27:12.125 --> 27:14.458
There was a moment...

27:14.458 --> 27:16.375
between us...

27:16.375 --> 27:18.041
at the end
of the evening

27:18.041 --> 27:20.125
when something...

27:20.125 --> 27:22.166
might've happened.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.000
But I chose to leave it

27:24.000 --> 27:26.583
and come home to you.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.417
Is that supposed
to make me feel better--

27:31.417 --> 27:34.333
the fact that you're
already having "moments"
with this woman?

27:34.333 --> 27:36.166
I chose you.

27:36.166 --> 27:38.375
I would hope so!

27:38.375 --> 27:40.834
You don't get
extra points for that.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.750
Right.
I'm going to bed.

28:15.500 --> 28:19.083
WOMAN: Yeah, like that.
Oh, yeah.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.417
Fuck me. Ohh!

28:21.417 --> 28:24.625
Yeah, like that.
Ohh, harder!

28:24.625 --> 28:26.333
Harder!

28:26.333 --> 28:29.166
Ohh, yeah, fuck me!

28:29.166 --> 28:33.041
[Moaning]

28:33.041 --> 28:36.166
[Moaning continues]

28:39.333 --> 28:41.583
Oh, yeah! Fuck me!

28:41.583 --> 28:44.750
[Moaning]

28:44.750 --> 28:52.875
[Moaning]
