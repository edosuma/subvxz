00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> when calls the heart...

00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
<i>Pleasure to meet</i>
<i>you, miss leveaux.</i>

00:00.001 --> 00:04.136
What brings you here?

00:04.138 --> 00:07.639
You barely know
this elizabeth thatcher.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.441
This is war.
I'm going to ruin you.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.310
<i>I received an offer</i>
<i>of a teaching position</i>

00:11.312 --> 00:15.247
I'm staying here.
This is where I belong.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.554
[footsteps]

00:22.556 --> 00:23.756
Is it true

00:23.758 --> 00:25.624
You're taking another
teaching job back east?

00:28.328 --> 00:30.396
Word spreads fast
in this town.

00:30.398 --> 00:33.198
I have an offer.
Nothing more.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.201
My family's doing.
They're worried about me.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.469
Well, that's understandable,

00:37.471 --> 00:39.371
With everything
that's gone on here.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.607
And going on.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.246
I've been thinking
a lot about this.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.281
And you and rosemary,
you have a history.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.351
And you have
a great deal in common.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.519
That's not true.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.155
From what I can see,
it is.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.322
Elizabeth...

00:57.324 --> 00:58.590
A man doesn't
propose to a woman

00:58.592 --> 01:00.125
And get over it so easily.

01:01.295 --> 01:06.465
To think long and hard
about your feelings

01:06.467 --> 01:09.401
Before you make a decision
you might regret.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.737
If that's what you want,
then I will.

01:13.373 --> 01:15.641
It is.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.644
Is that a squid?

01:21.548 --> 01:22.614
[defensively]: It's a comet.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.216
A comet? Uh...

01:26.119 --> 01:26.752
May I?

01:29.489 --> 01:31.657
Let's see.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.461
You-- [sighs]

01:35.463 --> 01:36.495
Comets...

01:36.497 --> 01:38.831
Have tails, right?

01:38.833 --> 01:41.533
Actually, it's just
evaporated materials and dust.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.403
Well, let's call it a tail.

01:44.405 --> 01:47.139
Thank you,
mr. Van gogh.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.273
[chalk scraping board]

01:56.116 --> 01:57.749
I can add a constellation
if you'd like?

01:57.751 --> 01:59.251
How about
you remove a constable

01:59.253 --> 02:02.454
What? So you can take credit
for my chalk work?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.522
[door opening]

02:05.325 --> 02:06.458
Good morning, children!

02:06.460 --> 02:07.893
Be sure to admire

02:07.895 --> 02:10.596
Mountie jack's artwork
on your way to your seats.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.331
He enjoys
compliments.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.832
Unlike miss thatcher,

02:13.834 --> 02:16.201
Who is uncomfortable
with compliments,

02:16.203 --> 02:18.303
Even though she's quite
deserving of them.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.541
School is in session,
mr. Thornton.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.743
If you'd like to speak,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.745
Please raise your hand
like all of the other children.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.313
[laughter]

02:32.519 --> 02:33.652
May I be excused?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.354
Yes, you may.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.322
Thank you, miss thatcher.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.466
All right.
Shall we begin?

02:47.468 --> 02:48.767
Yeah!

02:48.769 --> 02:50.903
[laughter]

02:50.905 --> 02:52.437
Now, when we think
of astronomy,

02:52.439 --> 02:55.307
We think of planets
and stars

02:55.309 --> 02:56.608
And things far away.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.343
But every 75 years,

02:58.345 --> 03:00.779
Something special passes
over the night sky.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.749
It's called halley's comet.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.584
Now, sometime soon,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.519
We'll be able
to look up in the sky

03:07.521 --> 03:10.222
And see a fiery comet
passing over coal valley

03:10.224 --> 03:11.223
As it orbits the sun.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.658
Wow!

03:12.660 --> 03:13.792
When will we know
to look up?

03:13.794 --> 03:16.595
Well, we won't, exactly.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.298
Comets aren't like stagecoaches,
they don't run on a schedule.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.301
So I suggest
we all keep our eyes out,

03:22.303 --> 03:25.437
Which means every night,
before you go to bed,

03:25.439 --> 03:29.408
I want you to look up at the sky
toward the mountains.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.644
Can my father see it
from heaven?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.780
Oh...

03:35.815 --> 03:37.516
I'm sure that he can.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.418
And all
the other fathers--

03:39.420 --> 03:40.452
Can they see it?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.321
All of our loved ones
we've lost

03:42.323 --> 03:43.589
Are watching over us...

03:43.591 --> 03:45.824
Just as god is.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.694
We can feel them
all around us,

03:48.696 --> 03:52.364
Their love
and their guidance...

03:52.366 --> 03:53.865
And that's not going to change.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.438
All right, children.
Let's return to the skies.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.610
Can you imagine a time

04:04.612 --> 04:08.480
When man might travel
into outer space?

04:08.482 --> 04:09.915
Why not a woman?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.552
Sorry
for interrupting.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.853
I overslept.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.623
Oh, dear!

04:17.625 --> 04:20.792
I can't remember the last time
I saw such a sad audience.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.761
This isn't an audience,
miss leveaux.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.829
What is it, then?

04:23.831 --> 04:26.565
It's a classroom.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.401
And who is to say a teacher
can't be entertaining?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.837
Oh! So you're a teacher now,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.439
Along with all of
your other occupations?

04:34.441 --> 04:37.376
Well, I did teach music
for a spell in new york.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.746
New york!
What's it like there?

04:40.748 --> 04:42.781
In the evening,

04:42.783 --> 04:47.486
Times square is filled
with music and lights

04:47.488 --> 04:48.654
And people,

04:48.656 --> 04:49.688
Even at midnight!

04:49.690 --> 04:52.858
And the buildings
are so tall,

04:52.860 --> 04:55.294
They touch the sky!

04:55.296 --> 04:56.528
Which is exactly
what we're studying--

04:56.530 --> 04:58.997
The sky.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.365
And we really
should get back to it.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.468
Oh. But I was just about
to tell them all

05:03.470 --> 05:05.437
About coney island.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.640
-Tell us!
-[overlapping]: Yeah!

05:08.642 --> 05:09.775
[laughs briefly]

05:09.777 --> 05:11.410
Miss thatcher?

05:12.645 --> 05:14.946
[children]:
Please, miss thatcher?

05:18.618 --> 05:21.353
[â™ª]

05:30.029 --> 05:31.797
I feel like
I've been replaced.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.699
Oh. That's not possible.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.001
I'm afraid halley
doesn't stand a chance

05:36.003 --> 05:37.803
Against
rosemary's comet.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.870
Don't comets
burn out?

05:38.872 --> 05:40.872
Not before setting fire

05:40.874 --> 05:42.908
To everything
in their path.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.544
Speaking
of setting fires--

05:45.546 --> 05:47.012
Is it my imagination,

05:47.014 --> 05:49.414
Or do you get prettier
with every passing day?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.882
It's your
imagination.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.617
And a little makeup.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.586
[laughs]
and that hair...

05:54.588 --> 05:55.887
And this dress.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.856
And flowers
in the cafe.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.458
A gift from bill.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.759
He comes in
so frequently,

06:00.761 --> 06:02.761
He thought it might
brighten the place up.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.097
I'm sure that's
the only reason.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.799
Maybe you're not
just mourning the past,

06:07.801 --> 06:09.768
But looking toward
the future as well?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.703
[sighs] perhaps.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.905
But we can't forget
why he's here.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.875
Wyatt!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.744
Hello, miss thatcher,
mrs. Stanton.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.745
Hello, wyatt.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.879
You're working
on a Sunday?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.981
My family needs the money.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.850
I took over
wendell backus's shift.

06:24.852 --> 06:25.917
He's sick.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.419
That's very kind
of you.

06:27.421 --> 06:28.687
The air down there's
hard to breathe

06:28.689 --> 06:30.856
For some of the older miners.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.958
I came to return these
before my shift.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.960
Thank you.
Do you need more?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.928
I haven't had much time
to read lately, ma'am.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.531
Well,
whenever you do,

06:39.533 --> 06:40.932
You are welcome
to my library.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.768
Thank you.

06:51.677 --> 06:54.479
These fragments are from
the point of explosion.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.747
The sediment burns

06:55.749 --> 06:57.949
Show the excessive level
of methane in the shaft.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.984
Which means those men

06:58.986 --> 07:00.752
Were sent into
a death trap.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.587
It's looking that way.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.724
Okay, thank you all

07:05.726 --> 07:07.826
For coming out today
on your Sunday afternoon.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.027
We're eager to know

07:09.029 --> 07:10.729
Why you gathered
us here, mr. Miller.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.930
Yes. Uh...

07:11.932 --> 07:14.499
When I lost my leg,

07:14.501 --> 07:16.768
I thought
I'd lost everything...

07:19.172 --> 07:21.506
But what I really lost
was my spirit.

07:21.508 --> 07:24.776
Now, I can't work
in that mine anymore,

07:24.778 --> 07:28.880
But I believe I've found
another way to be useful.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.982
Now, as some of you know,

07:30.984 --> 07:34.019
I used to be a pretty good
with a hammer and nail,

07:34.021 --> 07:37.088
So I took the liberty

07:37.090 --> 07:39.791
Of drawing up some plans...

07:39.793 --> 07:43.028
For a new church
and schoolhouse.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.996
[quiet gasping]

07:44.998 --> 07:48.834
Now, if we can just raise
a little money among us

07:48.836 --> 07:49.835
For supplies,

07:49.837 --> 07:51.236
I can build them,

07:51.238 --> 07:54.139
And help bring coal valley
back to where it was--

07:54.141 --> 07:57.042
A town with a...
With a proper church,

07:57.044 --> 07:59.811
And a...And a school
that isn't inside a saloon.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.486
This is a wonderful
idea, but...

08:07.488 --> 08:11.056
I'm afraid no one
has much to spare.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.624
I know I don't.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.693
I understand,
being in the same predicament,

08:14.695 --> 08:18.063
But we have to start somewhere.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.599
[gowen]:
I think mr. Miller's plan

08:20.601 --> 08:22.133
Is exactly
what this town needs.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.639
And I'm sure
that the company would be...

08:27.641 --> 08:30.709
More than happy to make
a sizeable donation.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.144
What a magnanimous gesture,
mr. Gowen.

08:33.146 --> 08:33.979
Well, thank you,
mrs. Ramsey,

08:33.981 --> 08:36.014
But a magnanimous gesture

08:36.016 --> 08:39.885
Would be to donate
the entirety of the money

08:39.887 --> 08:41.920
And to pay
for mr. Miller's labor.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.190
Unfortunately,
our reserves are tied up

08:45.192 --> 08:47.993
Defending against
this frivolous investigation.

08:49.529 --> 08:54.199
No investigation is frivolous
when 46 men are dead.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.037
An unspeakable tragedy.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.172
Yet I do have
to ask myself

09:01.174 --> 09:05.243
If perhaps mr. Avery's judgment
may be clouded...

09:05.245 --> 09:06.678
What with
your recent friendship.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.981
Your insults
will not silence me,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.083
Nor will your money.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.785
[huffs]

09:13.787 --> 09:18.123
Do we want to build
our town back up with a bribe?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.958
If we take his money,

09:19.960 --> 09:23.695
Then the company will own
more of us than they already do.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.697
The company already
owns us, abigail.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.831
The houses we live in,

09:26.833 --> 09:29.134
The streets we walk on,
even your cafe,

09:29.136 --> 09:30.869
Right?

09:30.871 --> 09:32.804
At least we would have
a proper place to worship.

09:32.806 --> 09:37.042
Without miners traipsing
through it at all hours.

09:37.044 --> 09:40.111
I believe that children
can learn anywhere,

09:40.113 --> 09:42.914
Be it in a schoolhouse
or in a saloon.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.016
Abraham lincoln
learned in a log cabin.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.053
Unfortunately,
your replacement may disagree.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.588
My replacement?

09:49.590 --> 09:52.924
Well, I assume...
Since you're leaving us.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.628
Is that true?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.696
No.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.998
That is, it's true

10:00.000 --> 10:02.801
I received an offer
of a position, but I haven't--

10:02.803 --> 10:04.703
When were you planning
on telling us, miss thatcher?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.870
Obviously
she wasn't.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.105
Who's gonna teach us?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.840
Oh, james, please.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.208
Nothing's been decided at all.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.843
You only just got here
a little while ago.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.011
You said you'd watch
the comet with us.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.014
And I will, james.

10:26.959 --> 10:27.892
[grunting]

10:37.036 --> 10:39.170
[gasps weakly and groans]

10:44.210 --> 10:46.945
[door creaks open]

10:46.947 --> 10:49.047
Bill!
Are you all right?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.315
What happened?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.217
Had a little unwanted visit
out at the mine.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.986
They took my forensic kit
with all the evidence.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.054
Did you get
a look at them?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.956
They had masks.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.224
Okay.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.159
-You take care of him, will you?
-Yes. Of course.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.293
I'm going with you.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.062
You're in no condition.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.830
I'm still your superior.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.033
Well...

11:08.035 --> 11:09.734
I'll make a note of
that in my report.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.203
[door shuts]

11:12.205 --> 11:15.240
This cut behind
your ear looks very deep.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.708
I think you might
need some stitches.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.076
The lengths
that I'll go to

11:18.078 --> 11:20.979
To get you to make
a fuss over me.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.814
You good with a needle?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.382
I've made all
my own curtains.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.085
Well, how about
sewing a person?

11:28.387 --> 11:30.922
Well, we're about
to find out.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.792
Ahem.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.859
I'll get my sewing kit.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.099
Jack?

11:41.101 --> 11:43.001
[rip growls]

11:43.003 --> 11:44.269
Woof.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.706
You. How thrilling.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.108
Well, you had better
get used to me.

11:54.313 --> 11:58.216
Fine. Be that way.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.284
Hmm!

12:06.092 --> 12:08.393
Hmm...

12:13.299 --> 12:17.869
And you'd better
get used to me too.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.189
Jack.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.991
Did you find them?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.259
The trail went cold.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.862
Too dark to be searching.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.931
Well, I'm glad
you're back safely.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.300
Were you worried
I wouldn't be?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.302
No.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.172
Yet you're out here in
the middle of the night waiting.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.541
If you must know,

12:56.543 --> 13:00.278
I was just watching
for halley's comet.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.213
Halley's comet.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.350
Do you know how many times
I've heard that excuse?

13:10.990 --> 13:12.891
Maybe I was a little worried.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.159
Just a little?

13:14.161 --> 13:15.226
Don't push it.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.861
[chuckles]

13:18.063 --> 13:21.399
I heard what happened
at the town meeting.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.134
I'm sorry.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.336
Thank you.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.206
I want you to know...

13:28.208 --> 13:30.975
Whether you decide
to leave or stay,

13:30.977 --> 13:33.111
I-I'll support you.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.246
You deserve to teach
in a real school,

13:35.248 --> 13:38.950
Elizabeth, not a...
Not a saloon.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.020
But I-I have faith that
that will happen here

13:42.022 --> 13:43.421
Sooner than later.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.191
The schoolhouse
doesn't really matter to me.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.292
It's the children.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.096
This town needs you, elizabeth.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.367
Not just this town.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.376
It's getting late.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.146
I should probably turn in.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.982
Of course.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.367
Good morning,
wyatt.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.369
Good morning, miss thatcher.
Do you have a minute?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.338
Of course!

14:33.340 --> 14:36.441
I wanted
to show you something.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.444
How does it...Work?

14:42.414 --> 14:44.482
Oh, my goodness.

14:50.122 --> 14:52.123
Oh! It's wonderful!
Where did you get this?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.258
[clicks off]

14:53.260 --> 14:54.259
I made it.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.361
You did?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.097
I got the idea
from your physics books,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.299
And the phonograph.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.102
If I could create
a bigger version,

15:04.104 --> 15:06.070
It could help circulate
the air in the mine,

15:06.072 --> 15:07.505
Help people
breathe better.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.440
Maybe even prevent
another disaster

15:09.442 --> 15:11.442
By venting
the dust and gas.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.611
And the blades
are made out of wood

15:13.613 --> 15:15.313
So that there's no risk
for a spark.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.283
I wasn't wrong about you,
was I?

15:18.285 --> 15:21.552
You are really quite
an extraordinary young man.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.121
Have you shown this to anyone?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.322
Just my mother.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.224
Made her cry.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.592
She was upset?

15:27.594 --> 15:30.128
No. Happy.
Does that make sense?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.297
Oh.

15:32.299 --> 15:37.402
Sometimes we women
cry when we're happy,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.370
Sometimes we cry
when we're sad,

15:39.372 --> 15:41.372
And sometimes
for no reason at all.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.441
Crying can be good,

15:43.443 --> 15:45.543
Bad,
or mean nothing at all?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.011
Exactly.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.546
I may know science,

15:48.548 --> 15:50.248
But I'll never
understand women.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.083
[chuckling]

15:52.085 --> 15:53.484
I think most men
would agree with you.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.186
Now, then.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.456
I'd like to telegram
my father's patent attorney

15:58.458 --> 15:59.490
About your fan.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.526
If you'd like
to leave it here,

16:01.528 --> 16:04.295
The constable can take
a photograph for us.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.496
Thank you,
miss thatcher.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.999
[door opens]

16:15.007 --> 16:17.108
A smile always
means something good.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.349
...I'd better check.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.050
[door opens]

16:27.353 --> 16:30.088
Hiding behind your desk?

16:35.260 --> 16:37.562
Mr. Avery.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.765
Well, it appears as if
you've been injured.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.500
Don't bother
acting surprised.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.303
I just wanted to let you know,
your threats won't stop me.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.704
Oh, I'm not surprised.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.108
And was that
another unwarranted accusation?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.110
What am I guilty of now?

16:52.112 --> 16:53.578
Well, if my hunch is right,

16:53.580 --> 16:56.314
Assault and theft
by your henchmen.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.715
I don't have henchmen.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.385
And I don't control
the people in this town.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.619
I beg to differ.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.121
If you close this mine,

17:03.123 --> 17:04.555
The men here
won't get paid.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.391
And if they don't
get paid,

17:06.393 --> 17:09.227
Then their wives can't
put food on the table.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.062
That would be
motivation enough

17:11.064 --> 17:12.697
For a lot of
people in this town

17:12.699 --> 17:15.666
I know it was you,
and I mean to prove it.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.568
Just like I'm going to prove

17:17.570 --> 17:19.737
That you knew
that shaft was unsafe.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.306
Ah, that'll open
a whole can of worms.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.541
I like worms.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.610
Good for fishing.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.379
'cause I feel like I'm about
to catch something pretty big.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.582
Well, you best get to it, then.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.317
But I have a feeling

17:33.319 --> 17:35.753
That all you're gonna do
is further hurt abigail stanton.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.756
The people
in this town,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.324
They think of her
very fondly.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.526
I, for one,

17:41.528 --> 17:43.127
Would hate
for that to change.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.128
Wouldn't you?

17:47.132 --> 17:49.267
You best be very careful
right now, gowen.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.768
Unless you plan on
arresting mr. Gowen,

17:50.770 --> 17:52.303
I suggest you take
your hands off him.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.174
Apparently
you do have henchmen.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.354
Tell me something, boys.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.823
Those standard-issue boots?

18:11.825 --> 18:14.392
They're for
your security firm?

18:19.398 --> 18:22.767
[â™ª]

18:26.438 --> 18:28.339
[applause]

18:28.341 --> 18:30.575
Oh, thank you!
Thank you.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.777
You're all so kind.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.545
Are there
any requests?

18:38.750 --> 18:41.719
Well, I'd like
to perform a song

18:41.721 --> 18:44.555
That was playing when I received
a proposal of marriage

18:44.557 --> 18:47.458
From a man I used to love...

18:47.460 --> 18:49.193
And still do.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.367
[â™ª]

18:59.271 --> 19:03.374
â™ª you made me love you

19:03.376 --> 19:05.409
â™ª I didn't wanna do it

19:05.411 --> 19:08.312
â™ª I didn't wanna
do it â™ª

19:08.314 --> 19:12.683
â™ª you made me want you

19:12.685 --> 19:14.886
â™ª and all the time
you knew it â™ª

19:14.888 --> 19:16.621
â™ª I guess
you always knew it â™ª

19:16.623 --> 19:19.557
â™ª you made me happy

19:19.559 --> 19:21.659
â™ª sometimes

19:21.661 --> 19:26.297
â™ª you made me glad

19:26.299 --> 19:30.768
â™ª but there were times, dear

19:30.770 --> 19:35.206
â™ª you made me feel so bad

19:39.578 --> 19:42.813
[â™ª]

20:05.571 --> 20:07.205
You didn't
like the song?

20:09.474 --> 20:12.376
I used to.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.312
When it meant something.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.722
We need to talk.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.591
I'd love to.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.493
About elizabeth.

20:29.495 --> 20:33.598
Or we could just sit in
companionable silence.

20:35.634 --> 20:41.305
I've been doing
some soul-searching,

20:41.307 --> 20:44.375
And I can't deny
you showing up here

20:44.377 --> 20:47.278
Has thrown me
for a loop.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.914
You are quite
something, rosie.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.483
You were once
the woman of my dreams,

20:52.485 --> 20:54.318
And I suppose
it's only natural

20:54.320 --> 20:59.624
That-- that old memories
might filter back in.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.926
But elizabeth and I,
we have a relationship.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.728
What kind
of relationship?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.863
I-I don't know,
exactly,

21:05.865 --> 21:08.032
But I know it's
the one I want to pursue.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.567
And would
a true relationship

21:09.569 --> 21:12.903
Be so easily sidetracked
by my presence?

21:12.905 --> 21:15.306
Your presence could
sidetrack an army.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.441
[laughs]

21:20.279 --> 21:24.448
You barely know this
elizabeth thatcher.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.284
Jack, you and I,

21:26.286 --> 21:28.452
We've known each other
a lifetime.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.391
I've been doing some
soul-searching too.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.027
And I realized

21:36.029 --> 21:38.629
That the only thing
that's ever felt real to me

21:38.631 --> 21:39.697
Is you.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.403
What? Do you doubt my words?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.505
Well, you've always been
a good actress.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.539
Thank you.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.410
It wasn't a compliment.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.545
Well, I'm gonna
take it as one.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.520
Have you told her
all of this?

22:05.557 --> 22:07.425
No. Not yet.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.828
Well, until you do,
I'll retain a shred of hope.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.899
Isn't that what
coal valley's all about?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.834
Hope?

22:19.638 --> 22:22.506
[â™ª]

22:31.016 --> 22:33.818
So, I've got
some exciting news to share.

22:33.820 --> 22:38.089
Thanks to the generosity
of an anonymous donor,

22:38.091 --> 22:40.458
We will begin
construction tomorrow

22:40.460 --> 22:44.462
On coal valley's
new church and schoolhouse.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.530
[gasping and applauding]

22:49.868 --> 22:53.437
I assume that we have
mr. Gowen to thank for this?

22:53.439 --> 22:56.540
Oh, uh... Well...
I'm not at liberty

22:56.542 --> 22:58.676
To disclose the donor,
but...

22:58.678 --> 23:02.913
I do feel obligated to say
that it was not mr. Gowen.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.517
Elizabeth?
Was it your father?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.753
No, it wasn't.

23:08.755 --> 23:13.457
But I believe it was from
someone equally as generous,

23:13.459 --> 23:15.493
With far less money
to spare.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.505
Doesn't "anonymous"
mean anonymous anymore?

23:29.508 --> 23:30.708
[laughs]

23:30.710 --> 23:33.010
You donated
your reward money?

23:34.846 --> 23:36.881
All of it?
For a church?

23:36.883 --> 23:38.582
And a school.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.618
Well, that is so...

23:44.956 --> 23:47.725
...Noble!

23:47.727 --> 23:49.894
Three cheers
for the constable!

23:49.896 --> 23:51.562
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

23:51.564 --> 23:53.731
Hip, hip, hooray!

23:56.868 --> 23:58.469
No, please sit down.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.603
Uh, folks...

23:59.605 --> 24:01.739
Let's not overdo it, please.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.908
I was just doing my job,

24:03.910 --> 24:07.578
And what better way
to spend that reward money

24:07.580 --> 24:09.046
Than to help the people
of coal valley,

24:09.048 --> 24:12.650
Who have all become
very important to me.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.686
Especially, uh,
one person in particular.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.887
Thank you, jack.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.890
And your generosity,

24:19.892 --> 24:22.026
Well, has made me
all the more fond of you.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.028
[gowen]: May I offer
my own words of gratitude

24:24.030 --> 24:25.095
To the constable?

24:26.698 --> 24:31.469
Not only have you made
our town a safer place,

24:31.471 --> 24:35.039
But I think we can all agree,
a better place.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.908
Now, since we're all
gathered here together,

24:37.910 --> 24:39.844
I have an announcement
to make.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.780
Unfortunately,
it is not a happy one,

24:42.782 --> 24:46.116
But I do believe it is something
that needs to be said.

24:46.118 --> 24:50.988
This is mr. Gentry.
He is the company lawyer,

24:50.990 --> 24:53.023
And he is in possession
of documents

24:53.025 --> 24:54.992
Which, now, I did not
want to bring to light,

24:54.994 --> 24:56.760
But it would seem

24:56.762 --> 24:58.529
That mrs. Stanton
has forced my hand.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.698
What hand would
that be, mr. Gowen?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.067
The one that write
checks to silence us,

25:03.069 --> 25:05.569
Or the one that ordered
the attack on mr. Avery?

25:05.571 --> 25:07.972
Does mr. Avery not
wish to speak for himself?

25:07.974 --> 25:09.940
Mr. Avery has gone
to get the circuit judge

25:09.942 --> 25:11.542
To bring you to justice.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.277
Well, that is good news.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.647
But the judge will not
be presiding over my trial.

25:19.618 --> 25:21.218
These documents prove

25:21.220 --> 25:24.121
That the guilt
for the terrible tragedy

25:24.123 --> 25:26.023
Which befell our town

25:26.025 --> 25:27.825
Lies with one man--

25:29.961 --> 25:31.562
Noah stanton.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.900
Your husband
was the superintendent.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.802
It was his decision
to lead those men into the mine,

25:38.804 --> 25:41.839
Knowing full well
conditions were unsafe.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.607
Noah would've never
done something like that.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.576
You are way out of line, gowen.

25:45.578 --> 25:48.112
Constable, let's let
the judge decide that.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.647
I started this investigation,
not mrs. Stanton,

25:49.649 --> 25:51.148
And I'm gonna see

25:51.150 --> 25:52.917
That it's finished
based on evidence--

25:52.919 --> 25:54.852
Not hearsay
and finger-pointing.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.221
I know that you
want to believe

25:57.223 --> 25:58.856
What mrs. Stanton
is saying.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.925
She's kind,

26:00.927 --> 26:02.793
And charming,

26:02.795 --> 26:06.830
And she makes the best biscuits
that any of us have ever tasted,

26:06.832 --> 26:08.966
But her husband
was a risk-taker,

26:08.968 --> 26:10.801
And his reputation
preceded him.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.904
That's why he was fired
by the lee mining company

26:13.906 --> 26:15.873
Prior to his arrival
in coal valley.

26:15.875 --> 26:16.807
He wasn't fired.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.611
He quit because
the working conditions

26:20.613 --> 26:21.679
Were deplorable.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.113
That's not
what his records show.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.848
Then those records
are fabricated,

26:24.850 --> 26:27.184
You know
that your husband's salary

26:27.186 --> 26:29.186
Was associated with
the amount of coal

26:29.188 --> 26:31.689
That his men dug out
of that mine every day.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.258
That shaft carried
a very rich deposit.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.860
Noah didn't care about money.
You can ask anyone here.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.296
You may not have known,
but your husband was in debt.

26:39.298 --> 26:43.033
Deeply in debt, I'm afraid.

26:43.035 --> 26:46.370
Desperation can cause a man
to take a great many risks.

26:46.372 --> 26:50.841
Noah stanton
was desperate for money.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.910
Desperate enough
to lead his men,

26:52.912 --> 26:55.045
And his own son,
into that mine,

26:55.047 --> 26:58.148
And to their graves.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.719
Good people of coal valley...

27:01.721 --> 27:05.623
What message was
noah stanton sending

27:05.625 --> 27:09.660
When we found this
after the disaster?

27:09.662 --> 27:13.230
What was once
a symbol of hope...

27:15.800 --> 27:17.935
May now be
an admission of guilt.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.874
[abigail]: You all knew noah.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.909
There wasn't anything
he wouldn't have done

27:25.911 --> 27:28.746
For any of you.

27:43.061 --> 27:45.029
The truth
will come out.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.230
Rest assured,

27:46.232 --> 27:48.032
Gowen will not succeed.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.034
Oh, I'm afraid
he already has.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.970
Did you see the way they
were all looking at me?

27:52.972 --> 27:56.273
You'll have your say in court,
and they'll hear you then.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.841
Oh, I pray you're right,
elizabeth,

27:57.843 --> 27:59.443
Because right now
I feel

27:59.445 --> 28:01.979
As if I'm losing everything
all over again.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.782
You won't lose me.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.018
You're a true friend.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.386
[chuckles]

28:09.388 --> 28:10.788
Perhaps the only one
I've got.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.122
No.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.692
You have many friends.
You'll see.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.060
They'll be standing
alongside you

28:16.062 --> 28:17.161
When the time comes.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.296
I'm not so sure.

28:21.933 --> 28:25.803
Noah did talk
of buying a claim.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.272
He wanted to start
his own business.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.275
Well, that doesn't
prove anything.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.010
Unless it caused him

28:33.012 --> 28:35.813
To do something
he wouldn't normally do.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.817
I didn't get to meet noah.

28:40.919 --> 28:43.754
But from everything
I've heard,

28:43.756 --> 28:45.856
He was a good and decent man.

28:45.858 --> 28:48.225
You must continue
to believe that.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.736
[horse whinnies]

29:01.339 --> 29:03.107
The judge got
stuck on a case

29:03.109 --> 29:04.775
In cooperville.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.009
He'll be in on
tomorrow's stagecoach.

29:06.011 --> 29:08.045
Judge farrell, I'm hoping?

29:08.047 --> 29:09.780
I'm afraid not.
Judge black.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.849
-Jedidiah black?
-Yes.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.884
I know him
only too well.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.953
Tell me.
Are the stories about him true?

29:17.856 --> 29:19.356
He once sentenced
a man to hang.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.459
The man jumped the rail in court
to attack him,

29:22.461 --> 29:24.862
And he pulled out his pistol
and shot him right there.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.131
In his defense,
as quick as he is with a pistol,

29:27.133 --> 29:28.532
He's just as quick with a gavel.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.868
Well, let's hope it's swinging
in the right direction.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.504
Last night, gowen managed
to sway half the town

29:33.506 --> 29:35.239
That noah stanton's to blame
for the explosion.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.109
I'm going
to see abigail.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.247
[sighing]

29:47.152 --> 29:49.119
[door opens]

29:51.222 --> 29:53.023
How are you?

29:54.325 --> 29:55.959
Well, I've been better,

29:55.961 --> 29:59.229
And I've been worse.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.365
I heard what happened
with gowen.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.966
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

30:04.269 --> 30:06.036
Would you like to sit down?

30:06.038 --> 30:09.273
As you can see,
you have your choice of tables.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.307
When the truth
comes out,

30:10.309 --> 30:11.542
And it will,

30:11.544 --> 30:13.544
This place
will be filled again.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.512
So much so, you'll
have to open another room.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.882
Right now, I'd give anything
just to have one customer.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.117
You have me.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.318
[door opens]

30:21.320 --> 30:23.954
And you've got me.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.522
And me.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.291
I don't know about
the rest of you,

30:27.293 --> 30:29.226
But I'm starving.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.994
[sighs]

30:30.996 --> 30:33.363
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.265
No, don't thank us.
You're the one who has to cook.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.266
[chuckling]

30:36.268 --> 30:37.434
[avery]:
I'll help.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.103
You cook?

30:40.105 --> 30:44.074
But you're not a doctor,
and you stitched me.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.409
Ah. Touche.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.152
Jack?

30:55.154 --> 30:56.887
Can we talk?

30:56.889 --> 30:58.455
We can.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.858
Though no matter
what I say,

31:00.860 --> 31:02.926
You seem to hear
something different.

31:05.964 --> 31:09.366
Well, then
let me say it.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.201
Last year,
I was in a play,

31:11.203 --> 31:12.236
The lead, of course,

31:12.238 --> 31:15.038
Who was in love
with someone else's man.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.976
The part never suited me.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.311
In fact, I was quite relieved
when the show ended.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.313
Well, are you saying
your performance in coal valley

31:23.315 --> 31:24.581
Is coming to an end?

31:24.583 --> 31:27.351
Let's just say
the curtain has fallen.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.886
On this act, at least.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.954
So you're leaving
on the stagecoach tomorrow?

31:32.156 --> 31:36.159
Unless something, or...
Someone stops me.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.129
[clears throat]

31:40.265 --> 31:42.332
[chuckles]

31:45.370 --> 31:47.204
I'm sorry, rosemary.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.574
So am I.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.019
Oh!

32:03.354 --> 32:05.656
Oh, my goodness!

32:05.658 --> 32:08.592
Either you all are very early,
or I am very late.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.295
We wanted to get here
before you, miss thatcher.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.963
Oh...

32:14.132 --> 32:16.033
"they are not long,

32:16.035 --> 32:18.035
The days of wine and roses--

32:18.037 --> 32:20.003
Out of a misty dream,

32:20.005 --> 32:22.372
Our path emerges for a while,

32:22.374 --> 32:27.577
Then closes within a dream."

32:27.579 --> 32:29.513
That poem was from
our first week together.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.284
Oh...

32:34.286 --> 32:37.421
It's...

32:37.423 --> 32:39.523
It's halley's comet.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.025
Oh, how lovely.

32:43.494 --> 32:45.462
This is from all of us.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.237
[gasps softly]

32:54.239 --> 32:56.139
[sighs] oh...

32:59.677 --> 33:01.078
Tears of sadness
or happiness,

33:01.080 --> 33:02.012
Miss thatcher?

33:04.349 --> 33:05.515
Both.

33:10.688 --> 33:14.257
Oh, I just love you all
so much.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.393
And you have taught me

33:16.395 --> 33:20.630
More than
you will ever know.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.300
But I want you to know
that I have...

33:23.302 --> 33:26.303
Made a decision.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.305
[sighs]

33:30.608 --> 33:32.476
I'm not leaving you.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.444
Not now
and not ever.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.679
We love you too,
miss thatcher.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.347
Are you staying
because of us,

33:37.349 --> 33:39.016
Or because
of mountie jack?

33:39.018 --> 33:41.518
That is a very
inappropriate question, gabe.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.086
Then it is mountie jack!

33:43.088 --> 33:45.389
[laughter and cheering]

33:45.391 --> 33:47.357
Oh, children!

33:59.570 --> 34:01.638
Hope is in the air.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.075
That
and a little coal dust.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.248
Welcome to coal
valley, your honor.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.182
I'm constable
jack thornton,

34:12.184 --> 34:14.718
And this is
abigail stanton.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.255
Nice to have made
your acquaintance, miss.

34:20.491 --> 34:21.658
Ma'am.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.794
Jedidiah black.

34:23.796 --> 34:26.096
Your reputation
proceeds you, judge.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.230
[chuckles]

34:27.232 --> 34:30.434
Well, unfortunately,
most of it's true.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.235
Stanton, huh?

34:32.237 --> 34:33.370
You're one of the widows?

34:33.372 --> 34:34.571
Uh, yes, sir.

34:34.573 --> 34:37.407
Waiting a long time
for our day in court.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.376
Well, it's here now.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.645
I can't promise
you're gonna like the results.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.680
I can
vouch for that.

34:43.682 --> 34:47.250
Well, it's been a long time,
if I recall correctly.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.320
You still holding a grudge
over a poker game?

34:50.322 --> 34:51.521
Only till
I win it back.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.690
Well, you might have
quite a wait, son.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.358
You got a witness list?

34:56.527 --> 34:58.095
In my room.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.531
Well, you might get it. Now.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.370
Why don't you let me?
I was going there anyway.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.505
Thank you, abigail.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.474
It's in my satchel.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.242
[driver]:
Judge?

35:13.744 --> 35:15.579
I trust you had
a safe ride in?

35:15.581 --> 35:17.681
Well, considering I got
out of cooperville alive,

35:17.683 --> 35:20.383
Well, it doesn't sound
all that good either.

35:20.385 --> 35:24.154
Justice prevailed.
That's what matters.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.593
You expecting someone?

35:29.595 --> 35:31.228
Yeah. Always.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.663
You make a lot of enemies
on this job.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.198
You got a saloon here?

35:35.200 --> 35:35.732
We do.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.700
Poker?

35:37.668 --> 35:39.302
We got that too.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.405
Trial starts at eight.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.673
Sharp.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.446
[man]:
Whoo! Today's the day!

35:52.183 --> 35:54.184
Black! It's time
to meet your maker!

35:54.186 --> 35:55.385
[whap]

35:57.388 --> 36:00.357
So apparently
his little brother here

36:00.359 --> 36:03.226
Don't agree
that justice prevailed.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.494
Lock him up, constable.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.230
Put him on my docket
for tomorrow.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.835
[sighs]

36:55.246 --> 36:56.413
Elizabeth?

36:57.715 --> 36:59.716
[exhales]

36:59.718 --> 37:01.384
Take a walk with me.

37:02.787 --> 37:05.255
Is there a reason
for this walk?

37:06.524 --> 37:08.258
There is.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.602
I have been doing
some reflecting

37:18.604 --> 37:19.936
And some reading.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.505
In fact, I borrowed
one of your history books.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.574
Really?

37:24.576 --> 37:25.875
-Yeah.
-[she laughs]

37:25.877 --> 37:27.911
Did you know that,
of the 27 men

37:27.913 --> 37:29.679
That have been president
of the United States,

37:29.681 --> 37:31.681
Only one
was a bachelor?

37:31.683 --> 37:32.916
Mm-hmm.
James buchanan.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.952
Okay, but can
you name one

37:35.954 --> 37:38.321
Notable accomplishment
of buchanan's?

37:38.323 --> 37:39.656
[laughs] actually,

37:39.658 --> 37:41.925
His failure to deal
with the south's succession

37:41.927 --> 37:43.593
Is considered one of the worst
presidential mistakes

37:43.595 --> 37:44.828
In history.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.663
My point exactly.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.632
What is your point?

37:48.634 --> 37:50.467
That perhaps
his poor judgment began

37:50.469 --> 37:52.569
By not having
a woman by his side.

37:52.571 --> 37:56.306
It was because he was
a confederate sympathizer.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.675
Is there anything
you don't know?

37:58.677 --> 38:01.511
I don't know the reason
for this conversation.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.413
I think you do.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.315
You're running
for president?

38:05.317 --> 38:08.518
[he chuckles and sighs]

38:08.520 --> 38:11.454
Is that a gift
to say goodbye?

38:11.456 --> 38:14.691
I-I didn't bring you up here
to say goodbye.

38:14.693 --> 38:15.825
Open it.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.846
You made this?

38:37.815 --> 38:40.650
A little hobby of mine.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.520
It's a lot harder for me
to say what's in my heart.

38:44.722 --> 38:48.425
I guess I'm not as brave
as everyone thinks.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.561
Yes you are.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.669
Elizabeth,

38:59.671 --> 39:01.905
I have thought long and hard
about us,

39:01.907 --> 39:03.807
As promised,

39:03.809 --> 39:07.510
And I-- I keep coming back
to the same conclusion.

39:10.715 --> 39:12.415
You're the one.

39:12.417 --> 39:15.352
You're the only one.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.487
And I know I said
that I'd support you

39:17.489 --> 39:19.823
Whatever
you decide to do...

39:19.825 --> 39:21.758
But I didn't mean it.

39:27.465 --> 39:28.631
Don't go.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.802
I'm not going anywhere, jack.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.374
[â™ª]

39:39.410 --> 39:41.745
This is where I belong.

40:12.877 --> 40:15.478
[â™ª]

40:20.151 --> 40:22.552
[elizabeth, writing]:
<i>And so I have resolved</i>

40:22.554 --> 40:24.854
<i>To make this place my home.</i>

40:24.856 --> 40:26.990
<i>There will be</i>
<i>difficult days ahead,</i>

40:26.992 --> 40:28.525
<i>No doubt.</i>

40:28.527 --> 40:32.629
<i>And uncertain ones.</i>

40:32.631 --> 40:34.731
<i>But I have faith</i>

40:34.733 --> 40:37.934
<i>That true happiness</i>
<i>awaits me here in coal valley,</i>

40:37.936 --> 40:39.969
<i>For what is life</i>

40:39.971 --> 40:42.672
<i>But a bittersweet mix</i>

40:42.674 --> 40:45.508
<i>Wonderment...</i>

40:45.510 --> 40:47.710
<i>Hope...</i>

40:47.712 --> 40:49.946
<i>And joy?</i>

41:40.564 --> 41:41.731
[man]: Hyah!
Giddyup!

41:41.733 --> 41:45.001
Elizabeth.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.669
I-I just wanted to say

41:46.671 --> 41:49.839
That despite whatever
has passed between us,

41:49.841 --> 41:51.908
I wish you all the best.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.142
And I you.

41:53.144 --> 41:56.746
Perhaps we could part
as friends, then?

41:56.748 --> 41:59.249
Friends it is.

41:59.251 --> 42:01.584
Are you headed
back to new york?

42:01.586 --> 42:03.953
Someday.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.722
Where are you headed, then?

42:05.724 --> 42:07.924
Well, for now,

42:07.926 --> 42:10.059
I'm only moving down the street
to a nicer room.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.995
I don't understand.

42:11.997 --> 42:14.597
The mayor has agreed to help me
start a theater group.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.967
Here?

42:17.969 --> 42:19.736
Yes! Isn't it wonderful?

42:19.738 --> 42:22.038
I'll be staying in coal valley,
after all.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.740
Seems we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

42:23.742 --> 42:25.141
Wonderful.
