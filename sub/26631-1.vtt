WEBVTT

00:41.084 --> 00:43.086
Oh, my God.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.296
Come on. Man.

00:49.467 --> 00:50.885
I don't know
this stuff.

00:50.969 --> 00:52.846
That's not even close.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.180
No.

00:54.264 --> 00:56.141
Teddy! Dinner, baby.

00:57.267 --> 00:58.393
Your father's waiting.

01:03.022 --> 01:06.192
What do you mean, you're protesting
the state achievement test?

01:06.526 --> 01:08.903
Sounds like
someone's unprepared.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.488
I am prepared.
Mmm.

01:10.697 --> 01:12.073
To take a stand.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.034
Pops, those standardized
tests are culturally biased.

01:15.326 --> 01:18.329
They want me to calculate the
average number of manatees

01:18.413 --> 01:19.497
that are in Florida.

01:19.581 --> 01:22.542
What does that have to do with
the African-American experience?

01:23.084 --> 01:24.252
You hear that, Gladys?

01:24.419 --> 01:26.379
We got Minister
Louis Farrakhan at the table.

01:27.756 --> 01:29.841
You know what, Teddy?
The last time I checked,

01:30.133 --> 01:32.177
your twin sister,
Denise here, is black.

01:32.677 --> 01:35.305
And she pulled a 1500
on the practice test.

01:35.472 --> 01:37.432
It was actually
a 1540, Daddy.

01:37.599 --> 01:40.351
Ah! You go, girl.
That's my baby.

01:40.977 --> 01:44.355
Just doing what I do best,
outshining Teddy's butt.

01:45.398 --> 01:47.859
What's this really
all about, Teddy bear?

01:47.942 --> 01:49.110
Hmm?

01:51.279 --> 01:52.906
Do you need help?

01:53.656 --> 01:55.575
Is that what
this is all about?

01:57.952 --> 01:59.120
I don't know, Mommy.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.208
Maybe I do need help.

02:05.043 --> 02:07.462
Help yourself to the goddamn
study book.

02:07.879 --> 02:10.673
Hell, you get 400 points
just for signing your name!

02:10.840 --> 02:12.926
You do know how to spell
your name, don't you?

02:13.092 --> 02:14.803
T-H-E...

02:15.011 --> 02:16.262
What?
You wrong.

02:16.346 --> 02:17.597
Ain't no "H" in my name.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.227
She's spelling
your legal name.

02:23.436 --> 02:24.687
Theodore.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.232
Well, there goes
those 400 points.

02:28.274 --> 02:29.818
She like a Chinese boy
at school.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.444
Shut your pie hole!

02:36.991 --> 02:38.391
Everyone, take a seat.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.961
T-H-E...

02:57.679 --> 03:00.056
Don't even look at him.
Stewart's an asshole.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.140
Okay, students.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.784
Please break the seal
on your test books

03:03.852 --> 03:05.103
and begin.

03:18.408 --> 03:19.534
Mmm.

03:36.885 --> 03:37.969
Done.

03:38.428 --> 03:39.508
You finished
the whole test?

03:39.554 --> 03:41.139
No, I'm done with this!

03:41.472 --> 03:42.765
I'm finished.

03:42.891 --> 03:44.517
Do I look like
a sheep to you, Marv?

03:44.976 --> 03:45.977
No.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.355
You all can continue to be sheep.
I'm not gonna be nobody's sheep.

03:49.439 --> 03:50.481
Mr. Walker.

03:53.526 --> 03:56.088
I don't know how to make the noise,
but you know what I'm trying to say.

03:56.112 --> 03:59.407
Y'all can keep falling for the
Man's plan, if you want to,

03:59.490 --> 04:02.035
but y'all gonna end up
in stupid student debt.

04:02.118 --> 04:03.912
You look like
bad credit already.

04:04.078 --> 04:08.166
This whole section right here
reeks of Discover cards,

04:08.249 --> 04:09.334
with your broke ass.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.668
I'mma be a winner.

04:10.752 --> 04:14.213
I'mma succeed in the School
of Life doing real stuff.

04:14.297 --> 04:17.591
I'mma get me a real fly car,
and I'm gonna have me a nice girl.

04:17.675 --> 04:18.843
Y'all ain't gonna
make it.

04:18.927 --> 04:20.345
Ted, get out!

04:20.428 --> 04:21.678
Denise got hair
on her titties.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.223
Cat's out the bag! Get out!
You're embarrassing us!

04:24.307 --> 04:26.809
Y'all some sheep!
Y'all sheep!

04:27.352 --> 04:29.270
In your face! Ha-ha.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.521
Stupid.

04:30.605 --> 04:33.024
And I'mma be rolling in the dough.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.194
And, by the way, I think
Denise has incredible titties.

04:36.361 --> 04:38.279
Marv, shut up!

04:49.499 --> 04:52.418
<i>Stacks on deck, Patrón on ice</i>

04:52.502 --> 04:54.504
<i>And we can pop
bottles all night</i>

04:54.587 --> 04:57.548
<i>Baby, you can have
whatever you like</i>

04:57.632 --> 05:00.885
<i>I said, you can have
whatever you like</i>

05:00.969 --> 05:02.095
<i>Yeah</i>

05:09.394 --> 05:10.770
<i>You like</i>

05:11.020 --> 05:14.023
<i>You can have
whatever you like</i>

05:14.107 --> 05:15.191
<i>Yeah</i>

05:21.489 --> 05:23.199
This project
has taken over my life.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.159
Come on.
God, I can't wait to sleep.

05:25.660 --> 05:26.744
Come here.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.663
Thank you, baby.
No problem.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.124
Oh. I'm so nervous
about tonight.

05:31.207 --> 05:32.667
Thank God you're coming.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.918
Why are you nervous?

05:34.002 --> 05:36.295
Lis, you did an amazing job.
You're gonna kill this.

05:37.005 --> 05:39.716
It'll be the hottest spot in Atlanta.
Okay.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.470
Will the lovely Maya be joining
us this evening as well?

05:44.846 --> 05:46.097
I don't like him.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.808
Chef Clemont invited my entire
team to dinner tonight.

05:48.891 --> 05:49.934
So, be nice, okay?

05:50.184 --> 05:51.936
Yes. Maybe try to
compliment her.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.104
Okay.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.982
Love you. Okay, bye.
Love you. Have a good day.

05:56.733 --> 05:59.235
Hey, Maya!
Hey, Teddy.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.112
Somebody looks extremely
attractive today.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.655
Thank you.

06:02.739 --> 06:05.241
Not that I'm looking at you the
same way I look at my woman

06:05.324 --> 06:06.404
because I wouldn't do that.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.119
Let's just go.
Let's go.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.203
I love the weave!

06:09.579 --> 06:10.580
Teddy!

06:10.872 --> 06:12.373
Or the wig. Whichever.

06:12.457 --> 06:13.583
It's my hair.

06:13.666 --> 06:15.066
- You did that, boo.
- Stop it!

06:15.460 --> 06:16.544
I'm just gonna stop.

06:17.003 --> 06:18.163
You get what
I'm trying to do.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.273
He's jealous
of your beauty.

06:19.297 --> 06:21.841
I blew it.
I definitely blew that.

06:25.762 --> 06:28.347
Oh, look, there's
Teddy. Teddy!

06:28.431 --> 06:29.891
Yo, Teddy!

06:33.227 --> 06:36.689
My name is Teddy, and I am here to
make your barbecue dreams come true.

06:36.773 --> 06:39.859
Now, Esther, you're a small woman,
but I know you have a big heart

06:39.942 --> 06:42.361
which is why I'd recommend
the Big Steel for you.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.197
Not a lot of women
can take this much steel,

06:44.280 --> 06:45.698
but I know you can.
Mmm.

06:46.282 --> 06:47.867
The Pitbull, huh?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.040
You're not Spanish,
are you?

06:54.123 --> 06:55.875
I can see it
in your eyes, Morris.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.170
But I can also tell that your
wife isn't on the same page.

07:00.421 --> 07:03.591
I mean, it's not like she completely
controls the purse strings.

07:06.219 --> 07:07.428
Enjoy it!

07:08.221 --> 07:09.722
Don't you let me down!

07:12.809 --> 07:15.061
You better stop it, man.
Don't you start that.

07:15.144 --> 07:16.979
That was
a master class.

07:17.063 --> 07:19.065
I couldn't get Bobby Flay
to buy that beast.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.817
You know what?
Once I saw the man-purse

07:20.900 --> 07:22.860
the guy was putty in my hands.
He really was.

07:24.779 --> 07:28.199
Teddy, I just want you to know,
you are like the son I never had.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.409
Well, I mean, come on,
you got Joe Junior.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.288
Well, yeah,
but he's the son I do have

07:34.372 --> 07:36.582
and I'm just not all
that crazy about him.

07:36.666 --> 07:37.875
I mean, look at him.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.837
But my point is this,
all those years ago

07:40.920 --> 07:43.506
I took a chance
on a pimply-faced teenager.

07:44.382 --> 07:47.468
My little Gary Coleman.
My little Webster.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.721
And it turned out
great for both of us.

07:51.222 --> 07:54.016
So I've decided,
when I retire...

07:55.768 --> 07:57.395
I'm turning
Barbecue City

07:58.271 --> 08:00.690
over to you.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.525
Excuse me?

08:03.192 --> 08:04.193
What?

08:04.694 --> 08:05.987
Don't shit me.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.155
I'm serious!

08:07.238 --> 08:10.158
Oh, my God, Joe!
I just got goose bumps!

08:10.241 --> 08:12.535
Yes.
I got goose bumps all over!

08:12.618 --> 08:14.218
I don't know what to say, man!
Thank you!

08:14.453 --> 08:17.290
No, thank you, son.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.251
Whatchu talkin' bout, Joe?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.753
You better come here,
Mr. Drummond.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.840
All yours, Teddy.

08:27.383 --> 08:28.801
What do you think?
Oh...

08:29.343 --> 08:30.386
It's amazing.

08:30.469 --> 08:31.470
Really?
Yeah.

08:31.721 --> 08:33.681
But as your unofficial
financial adviser,

08:34.015 --> 08:37.184
I'm obligated to tell you that this
ring is way out of your budget.

08:37.268 --> 08:38.436
Relax.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.313
Lisa's cool as hell.
She knows who you are.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.315
Lisa does not
know who I am.

08:42.398 --> 08:45.109
Lisa knows that I'm a
successful barbecue salesman.

08:45.318 --> 08:47.570
Marvin knows that Teddy's
a high school dropout

08:47.653 --> 08:48.988
who's living paycheck
to paycheck

08:49.071 --> 08:51.049
'cause I'm with a woman that's
way above my weight class.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.910
Your life is built on
a financial house of cards.

08:53.993 --> 08:55.786
Stop it.
The Porsche, the duplex.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.246
What are you
trying to prove?

08:57.330 --> 09:00.374
Plus, every single time we go out,
she offers to pay for the check.

09:00.625 --> 09:02.186
The day that I let her
put down her plastic

09:02.210 --> 09:03.377
is the day
that I lose her.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.439
And you know that. I don't
know why I was so nervous.

09:05.463 --> 09:06.464
It's come together.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.715
Hey.
Hi.

09:07.798 --> 09:08.799
Lisa.

09:08.883 --> 09:10.176
Hi.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.262
Dude, Lisa's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

09:13.346 --> 09:15.223
I don't wanna
mess this one up, man.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.850
I told them.
He did.

09:18.851 --> 09:20.228
- He actually said that.
- Ooh!

09:20.436 --> 09:21.812
Some dessert.
That looks amazing.

09:22.063 --> 09:23.356
Wow. Thank you.
Wow.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.317
Chef Clemont also said that
there will be no check.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.569
This is all on him.

09:28.778 --> 09:29.779
Wow.

09:29.862 --> 09:30.905
I knew he would try this.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.658
You know what? Tell him I appreciate
it, but I insist on paying.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.243
Okay.
Okay, well, just wait.

09:35.326 --> 09:36.994
Well, hold on
now, honey.

09:37.245 --> 09:39.640
Honey, you don't want to offend him.
You're his guest, right?

09:39.664 --> 09:41.266
Trust me, you never take
a free meal from a client.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.559
That way, you don't
owe them anything.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.583
That's true.

09:43.668 --> 09:45.508
- Thank you, Lisa. Appreciate it.
- You know.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.755
- Whenever you're ready.
- Thank you.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.817
You know what then, baby?
If that's the case, then let me...

09:50.841 --> 09:54.011
No. Baby, this is my thing.
There's, like, eight of us. I got it.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.888
You can probably
write it off, right? Yes.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.474
I didn't think about that.
It is a business expense. Okay.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.685
- Come on.
- Wait, wait. Hold up, Lis.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.062
It is a business
expense, but, Lis,

10:03.145 --> 10:05.231
it's clear that Teddy
really wants to treat.

10:06.399 --> 10:09.026
We're out here celebrating you.
Let him.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.988
Right, Teddy?

10:12.822 --> 10:14.657
Yes.
Wow.

10:14.824 --> 10:15.908
Yes.

10:15.992 --> 10:18.619
Why aren't we closer?
'Cause you get me.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.162
I have it. I got it.

10:20.246 --> 10:21.497
I love you.
Love you back.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.833
- Black love.
- Okay.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.751
Oh, shit.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.587
All right, Marvin. Hit me.
Thank you.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.649
It's so good. LISA: One of my
favorite things that he does.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.859
- That caramel tart, he's known for it.
- All right.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.970
Oh, I gotta get in that.
Definitely gonna try that.

10:36.095 --> 10:37.972
Mmm-mmm.
- So amazing.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.700
Aren't these beautiful?
He did these just for us.

10:39.724 --> 10:41.702
- Did he?
- Yeah. You should try this caramel.

10:41.726 --> 10:43.936
I'm gonna take a little bit of it.
Get in there.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.022
Take me through.
Lisa, take me through.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.982
So this is a chair.
Straight up, it's a chair.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.525
I know that much.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.961
Give me the <i>Behind the
Music</i> about the chair.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.337
Pretend I'm on VH1
or something like that.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.298
Well, actually, these chairs
have a very interesting story.

10:54.322 --> 10:56.907
- They're from Denmark. Found them
in a warehouse. - Whoa...

10:57.825 --> 11:00.328
Mid-century, modern,
kind of rounded.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.806
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know it's blue and stuff like that.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.224
I didn't know you were so
into chairs.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.291
You would not believe.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.185
I'll go home, I'll look at my chair,
I get turned on in a second.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.729
- It's just a weird fetish of mine.
- You would love these.

11:08.753 --> 11:11.064
Because I don't know if you noticed
the cerulean kind of undertone

11:11.088 --> 11:14.300
of the wallpaper, but we kind of
wanted to tie it all together

11:14.383 --> 11:16.677
to kind of offset the harder,
more straighter lines.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.846
What is that?

11:20.348 --> 11:21.640
Oh, my God.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.642
Oh, my God!

11:25.186 --> 11:26.562
No, no, no!

11:26.687 --> 11:28.457
What? Is there a problem
with the dessert, sir?

11:28.481 --> 11:30.024
I think that's pubic hair
in the cake.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.543
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.486
Is this pubic hair
in my damn dessert?

11:33.569 --> 11:34.737
May I?

11:36.322 --> 11:38.115
I'm sorry, what?
May I please take it?

11:38.199 --> 11:39.679
Literally, I'm telling you
what it is.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.826
Uh...

11:47.750 --> 11:49.126
This is way too many pubes.

11:50.086 --> 11:51.170
What does that mean?

11:51.253 --> 11:53.631
I mean, one is too many pubes.
If you could tell the chef.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.567
Thank you. Thank you for
taking care of this for us.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.134
I believe you planted these.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.571
No, no, no.
What did you just say?

11:59.595 --> 12:01.680
Stop. I got this.
Now, that's insane of you.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.558
I've known this man my entire life.
He's not a pube planter, sir.

12:04.642 --> 12:06.018
No, no, stop, Marv. Stop.

12:06.102 --> 12:07.269
Maybe you planted them.

12:07.353 --> 12:08.646
What?
Boom.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.998
I risked my life
coming to this country

12:10.022 --> 12:12.316
so I can plant pubes on some
random guy's cheesecake?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.760
I don't know
what you're into, man.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.779
And I have a flash of news for you, guy.
I manscape down here.

12:16.862 --> 12:20.157
Okay. That's my woman,
and that's too much information.

12:20.241 --> 12:24.245
And these are the pubes of
an African-American guy.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.288
Oh, shit.
What? That's racist, man.

12:26.372 --> 12:28.165
It's descriptive.

12:28.249 --> 12:29.792
Descriptive, my ass.
That's racist.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.503
Luis. That's what they are.
Afro-pubes.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.731
Friends, friends, what is happening?
What is happening?

12:34.755 --> 12:35.881
Pubes and racism.

12:35.965 --> 12:37.007
Chef Clemont...

12:39.510 --> 12:41.571
All right? I go to
take a bite of my cheesecake,

12:41.595 --> 12:43.889
there's what appears to be
pubic hair in my cake.

12:43.973 --> 12:47.518
That he planted with his
African-American short and curly pubes.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.205
Say African-American again,
and I'mma get dark and curly in your ass!

12:50.229 --> 12:52.189
I will say it again!
Say it again!

12:52.273 --> 12:54.167
You want to dance?
'Cause I'll boogie-woogie.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.569
Please, everyone calm down.
I am mortified by this.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.070
I am so sorry, everyone.

12:58.737 --> 12:59.864
The meal is on me.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.827
No. This is what he wants.
Thank you, thank you.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.301
Luis, I need to speak
to you in the kitchen.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.368
Go in the kitchen, man.

13:04.452 --> 13:05.578
You're going to die.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.472
Luis, I need to speak to you
in the kitchen.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.206
You messed with the wrong guy.

13:09.290 --> 13:10.708
Luis, right now.
Right now.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.543
You better go!
Okay. Baby, just...

13:12.626 --> 13:14.026
What is your problem?
You better go!

13:14.336 --> 13:15.605
You embarrass me in front of...
Gotta be kidding me.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.024
- Chef, please.
- I don't want to get into it.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.217
Feel like it's a cloud
of racism around me.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.847
Teddy, what is going on?
Haven't we had enough surprises tonight?

13:24.930 --> 13:29.768
Well, I promise you that this
one will be worth it, okay?

13:30.436 --> 13:31.437
Oh, my God.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.063
What's all this?

13:33.147 --> 13:36.442
Well, I will tell you
what's going on.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.320
So listen to this.
Joe told me today

13:39.403 --> 13:42.740
that when he retires,
he's leaving all of this to me.

13:43.199 --> 13:44.450
Baby, that's amazing.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.452
I mean, it's life-changing.
Yeah.

13:46.535 --> 13:50.289
And maybe you could put your touch
on this place, change the design?

13:50.372 --> 13:51.749
Help take it
to the next level?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.417
I am so proud
of you. Yeah.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.003
Maybe we expand, franchise even.
Yes. Yeah.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.880
Yes. Oh, yeah, baby.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.883
We could do a lot with this place.
First of all, we could change the logo.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.968
Barbecue Nation.
Barbecue Safari.

14:03.135 --> 14:04.571
I mean, there's so
many things we could do.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.722
Honestly, I have so many ideas.

14:09.391 --> 14:12.561
I just know that with you by my
side that anything is possible.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.193
Oh, my God.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.701
Yes.
Yes?

14:27.785 --> 14:29.411
Yes! Yes!
Yes!

14:34.750 --> 14:36.877
Wait, the ring. Here, you
gotta put the ring on.

14:36.961 --> 14:39.421
Oh, my God.
I love it.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.340
Let's celebrate then.
Huh?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.318
You know I had to get some champagne.
Oh, my God.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.928
I said, "Look, and my baby
gonna like it."

14:46.470 --> 14:48.639
Let me pour some
champagne for my fiancée.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.057
Fiancée.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.725
All right,
let's make a toast.

14:51.809 --> 14:54.395
To us.
To us.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.734
Baby?
Hmm?

15:00.818 --> 15:01.860
Do you smell gas?

15:01.944 --> 15:05.322
I was nervous, babe.
I didn't know you'd smell it. I tried...

15:05.406 --> 15:08.993
No. Actual propane?

15:09.076 --> 15:10.286
Why don't you
go stand outside?

15:10.369 --> 15:12.529
I'll situate everything in here,
and I'll get you home.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
Okay.

15:13.664 --> 15:14.999
Love you.
Be ready.

15:17.126 --> 15:21.797
So, guys, my sweet little Teddy
bear just popped the question.

15:25.718 --> 15:27.011
And big surprise...

15:29.722 --> 15:31.515
I said yes!

15:32.182 --> 15:33.309
Shit!

15:39.398 --> 15:42.318
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

15:42.651 --> 15:44.278
Oh! God! Baby!

15:47.906 --> 15:49.033
Teddy, are you okay?

15:49.116 --> 15:53.829
I need you to tell my fiancée
there's been an accident.

15:54.163 --> 15:55.539
Baby, it's me.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.334
Yeah?
Can you see me? Teddy?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.169
I'm your fiancée.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.547
Good. I've been
in an accident.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.466
Oh, baby.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.096
<i>So Joe
didn't have insurance?</i>

16:11.221 --> 16:12.806
Yeah, of course,
he did, Marv.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.933
He took the money
and ran off to Florida.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.102
Dude, I've been looking
for a job everywhere, man.

16:17.436 --> 16:21.065
But there are no decent sales jobs for an
employee of the month at Barbecue City.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.567
We'd hire you here,
but you need to get your GED.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.735
Think about it.

16:25.027 --> 16:28.322
These guys bullshit clients all day
about funds they don't understand.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.490
You would be a natural.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.176
So you're saying that
if I graduate from high school

16:31.200 --> 16:33.285
that then you could
give me job here? Yeah.

16:33.369 --> 16:35.680
But you hate school so why are we
even having this conversation?

16:35.704 --> 16:38.290
No, no, no. I'm not talking
about going to school.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.334
I'm talking about
gettin' my GED.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.127
And that's different.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.546
See, to get my GED, all I
gotta do is go to the school,

16:44.630 --> 16:45.910
charm the principal
a little bit.

16:45.964 --> 16:46.965
Right?
Yeah.

16:47.049 --> 16:50.135
Get what I want, which is my GED.
Sounds pretty easy to me, Marv.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.763
If you got your GED...
Huh?

16:53.138 --> 16:54.298
I could probably hook you up.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.809
Listen to me, though.
Stop. Stop, okay?

16:56.892 --> 16:58.143
Do yourself a favor

16:58.227 --> 17:00.479
and do not tell Lisa about
this until it's a done deal.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.981
Now, you know I'm smarter
than that, Marv.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.067
You're gonna be
a financial analyst?

17:05.150 --> 17:06.151
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

17:06.234 --> 17:08.278
I am, babe, and it starts
immediately.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.882
I was talking to Marv, and he says
that they could really use somebody

17:10.906 --> 17:12.741
<i>with my skill set at his firm.</i>

17:12.825 --> 17:13.867
That's great!

17:13.951 --> 17:15.387
<i>That's a great opportunity.</i>

17:15.411 --> 17:16.453
Um...

17:16.537 --> 17:17.954
Yeah. I mean,

17:18.038 --> 17:20.874
I'm basically pumped
up about it. You know?

17:20.958 --> 17:23.292
You are so resilient, baby.
You keep bouncing back.

17:23.377 --> 17:24.545
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

17:24.627 --> 17:25.671
Yeah.

17:25.753 --> 17:26.839
I love you.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.382
I love you, too.

17:33.470 --> 17:36.640
Ma, of course the thong is gonna
cut you in the booty hole.

17:36.723 --> 17:37.808
That's what it do.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.185
Look, next time Leon wanna
stick somebody in a thong,

17:40.269 --> 17:42.896
you tell him that he need to
put it on and get a mirror

17:42.980 --> 17:44.523
and check and see
what his balls do.

17:45.566 --> 17:47.484
I don't care
if he is your pastor!

17:47.901 --> 17:50.946
Do the congregation know
he a freak like that?

17:52.823 --> 17:53.866
Hold on, Mama.

17:54.283 --> 17:55.659
Can I help you, sir?

17:55.993 --> 17:57.035
Um...

17:57.953 --> 18:00.873
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.666
Excuse me?
You kind of loud.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.376
Well, then get out my car.

18:04.460 --> 18:05.979
I'm not in your car.
I'm clearly in my car.

18:06.003 --> 18:08.172
No, you're in my car.
You're speaking loud enough...

18:08.255 --> 18:09.923
What are you?
The volume control police?

18:10.007 --> 18:11.151
I'm not sure
if that's even a thing.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.886
Mind your business. Your business
is becoming my business.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.363
Why don't you work
on your windshield?

18:15.387 --> 18:16.763
Now you're really
in my business.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.992
Probably look like a kaleidoscope
when you look through it.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.201
You know,
why don't you just...

18:20.225 --> 18:21.494
You probably feel like
a little honeybee.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.645
Enough. Looking at 18
things at one time,

18:23.729 --> 18:25.165
but really, you're just
looking at one thing.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.482
I'mma get in
your business now.

18:26.899 --> 18:30.486
Tell your mother that she can go buy a
box of G-strings with her nasty ass.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.862
You talking about my mama now?

18:31.945 --> 18:35.157
Any pastor that's putting a thong
on his balls ain't right with God.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.992
Psh. What?
Don't "psh" me.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.329
Yeah.

18:42.581 --> 18:43.790
I bet that hurt your throat.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.042
Drive your car.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.127
What, Mama?
Your mother's nasty.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.931
Girl, yeah, that's a little
burnt leprechaun

18:49.004 --> 18:51.965
sitting next to me at this damn
light, all in our conversation.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.593
Excuse me? Hey! Nah, girl, you
know he ain't got no gold.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.446
You know he ain't got no gold.
How about you grow up?

18:56.470 --> 18:57.971
Bye, boo.
Hey!

18:58.805 --> 19:01.642
Speaking of toast, if you...
God damn it, Teddy.

19:02.893 --> 19:03.936
- Gotta work...
- Hey, yo!

19:04.019 --> 19:05.099
Who you honking...
Let's go!

19:05.145 --> 19:06.730
I can't even see.
Where's my mirror?

19:06.813 --> 19:09.024
Go, man!
Hey! Who you honking at?

19:25.499 --> 19:28.460
<i>So, game the system again,
did we, Teddy?</i>

19:28.835 --> 19:30.396
<i>Stewart,
what is your problem with me?</i>

19:30.420 --> 19:31.838
My problem
with you, Teddy,

19:31.922 --> 19:34.762
is that students like you bring down
the reputation of this high school.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.302
You may have everybody else
at this school fooled,

19:37.344 --> 19:38.821
but I know you're actually
covering up

19:38.845 --> 19:40.865
for the fact that you're
really just not that smart.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.767
In fact, you might be the
dumbest student at this school.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.738
I am the
music teacher.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.658
I don't know the first thing
about teaching biology.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.785
Oh, for God's sakes!

20:01.868 --> 20:05.914
What part of "There is no musical
program" do you not understand, Trish?

20:06.206 --> 20:09.209
Nobody's getting into Ivy League
schools on a bassoon scholarship.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.294
Oh, shit!

20:10.377 --> 20:11.479
<i>You know,
I'm not book smart.</i>

20:11.503 --> 20:14.715
Stewart's smarter than me.
But you know what I'm not?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.550
I'm not a freak
of nature, Stew.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.718
Uh-oh, Stew.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.219
Don't do this, Teddy.

20:19.303 --> 20:21.096
Hey, quick question,
everybody.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.849
Has anybody here ever seen
Stewart with his shirt off?

20:23.932 --> 20:26.101
It's a birthmark!
It's a birthmark!

20:26.184 --> 20:27.912
If it's a birthmark,
let us see it right now.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.397
Prove it! You all wanna
see my birthmark?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.481
Come on, I'm dying!

20:31.565 --> 20:32.774
I'll prove it! See?

20:36.111 --> 20:37.487
It's a birthmark!

20:37.571 --> 20:39.740
You got a pig's butthole
on your chest, man.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.908
There's no hole in it,
so how could it be a butthole?

20:41.992 --> 20:43.869
<i>You got
a third nipple, man!</i>

20:43.952 --> 20:45.746
Who's next, Dolores?

20:45.829 --> 20:47.664
This young man right here.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.169
Hey! What's up, Stewart?

20:55.213 --> 20:56.673
We had good times,
didn't we?

20:57.215 --> 20:59.217
I laugh at how much
we laughed.

21:09.019 --> 21:12.105
So, how long you been
the principal, man?

21:12.189 --> 21:13.357
Going on two years.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.441
Wow.
Yeah.

21:14.524 --> 21:19.529
Wasn't easy, but cleaned this place
up using my brain and my bat.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.424
As opposed to when
we went to high school,

21:21.448 --> 21:24.117
now if you have a D average,
you're out.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.535
Can you do that?

21:25.619 --> 21:27.287
I can do whatever
I want, Teddy.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.998
This my house.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.644
I'm sorry.
What was the last part?

21:32.668 --> 21:33.835
I said look around you.

21:34.628 --> 21:39.466
This is my house.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.614
Excuse me for asking, but are
you doing a black voice?

21:44.638 --> 21:46.765
No. No. Not a black voice.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.642
You sure?
I don't hear color.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.728
Mmm. What brings you back
to Piedmont, Mr. Walker?

21:51.812 --> 21:54.523
Right now, I'm transitioning
from an amazing job in sales

21:54.606 --> 21:55.607
to a job in finance.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.402
And the only thing that's really
holding up this transition

21:58.485 --> 22:01.113
is me not having my GED.

22:01.655 --> 22:02.989
So, I don't know,
I was thinking

22:03.073 --> 22:05.200
maybe I could get you to cross
some T's, dot some I's.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.662
Maybe you could do a favor
for an old friend.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.331
Some things just
never change, huh, Teddy?

22:11.581 --> 22:16.044
You want me to help you find a
shortcut to getting your diploma.

22:16.128 --> 22:18.380
No. Yes.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.048
Mmm.

22:20.841 --> 22:22.759
I wish I could. I really do.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.845
But you would have to go
to night school

22:24.928 --> 22:26.847
to learn how to pass
the GED test

22:27.389 --> 22:30.058
and unfortunately, we don't
offer night school here.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.310
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.312
Let me walk you out.

22:37.733 --> 22:38.734
You wanna touch her?

22:38.859 --> 22:39.860
I'm sorry?

22:40.026 --> 22:42.612
Come on.
Touch my big, black bat.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.781
Um... No. I'm...

22:44.865 --> 22:46.867
Go ahead. Say hi.

22:49.327 --> 22:50.954
Ah...

22:52.622 --> 22:57.419
You used to call me crazy
Stewart, now you call me Batman.

23:01.506 --> 23:02.632
Uh...

23:02.716 --> 23:03.717
If...

23:03.800 --> 23:05.886
Remove the Beats
by Andre, Rudy.

23:05.969 --> 23:09.806
School policy, no headphones on campus
unless you're using Rosetta Stone.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.351
Hey, Stew, you think you're taking the
right approach here with these kids?

23:13.810 --> 23:15.437
They look a little
stressed out, man.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.315
I am preparing them
for the real world, Teddy.

23:18.398 --> 23:22.027
Okay? I may not be their best friend
but everyone here respects me.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.779
Okay.
What the fuck, Stewart?

23:23.862 --> 23:26.782
Hey, hey, hey. Let's watch the
language, please, Miss Carter.

23:26.865 --> 23:29.326
Why did you add AP Calculus
to my class load?

23:29.409 --> 23:31.912
Knowing good and well I already
have five units to teach

23:31.995 --> 23:34.039
plus night school.
It's too much!

23:34.122 --> 23:36.750
Wait. Hold on. You're
the night school teacher?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.811
Nah, I'm just the bitch
that likes to wear blouses.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.253
Yes, I'm the night
school teacher.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.273
Did you bring me some dried
shamrocks, leprechaun?

23:42.297 --> 23:43.590
It's still not funny.

23:43.673 --> 23:44.841
Wait. Hold up!

23:45.675 --> 23:47.862
Stewart, why did you just tell me that
you don't have night school here?

23:47.886 --> 23:49.054
Why would you say that?

23:49.137 --> 23:52.557
I said that because Teddy and
I went to school together.

23:52.641 --> 23:55.602
He is quite frankly
a terrible student

23:55.685 --> 23:57.646
and I did not want that
element in here.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.356
I don't care if he's
as dumb as a Minion.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.399
He is welcome to take
my class if he wants.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.276
Thank you.
Thank you for that.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.737
You're welcome.
'Cause you need it.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.739
Carrie, can we just
take down the 'tude?

24:07.822 --> 24:09.366
'Tude? Really?
No, I...

24:09.449 --> 24:11.660
You haven't even seen the
beginning of this attitude.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.912
Wait, say that to me again.
I apologize.

24:13.995 --> 24:15.413
That was a poor
choice of words.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.749
I just mean, I need you
to show me the respect

24:17.832 --> 24:19.543
that you would
show your boss.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.961
Because it's your
house, right?

24:21.044 --> 24:22.754
You did the black
voice thing with him?

24:22.837 --> 24:25.674
It's not a black voice.
In actuality, not a black voice.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.300
No, you do a black voice.

24:27.384 --> 24:28.861
You don't remember when
you was in that meeting?

24:28.885 --> 24:31.471
You was like, "We gonna get it lit
up in here. This meeting lit."

24:31.555 --> 24:32.639
It was very lit.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.492
You did it at
the staff meeting,

24:34.516 --> 24:36.268
when you were like,
"I keep it 100."

24:36.351 --> 24:37.727
When have I never
kept it 100?

24:38.144 --> 24:40.814
When you added that AP
Calculus to my class load.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.107
All right.
Agree to disagree.

24:42.190 --> 24:45.610
Listen, I hate to break up this
pleasure party of delusion.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.112
But I have work to do.

24:47.404 --> 24:49.155
Wow.
So if you'll excuse me...

24:50.073 --> 24:52.742
I'mma do my thing.

24:55.453 --> 24:56.705
That's a black voice.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.873
Look alive, people.

24:59.207 --> 25:02.002
Move with purpose.
Go, go, go, go!

25:02.085 --> 25:03.461
Hey.
No loitering in my hall.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.339
Hey, can he really do that?
Can he keep me from going here?

25:06.423 --> 25:09.801
No, he can't. As a matter of fact,
here's a textbook.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.886
I'm actually going to set
up the class right now

25:11.970 --> 25:15.181
for our first session of the semester.
We start at 7:00.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.058
Yeah, but this book is
just kind of thick.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.894
I thought it'd be
more like a leaflet.

25:22.856 --> 25:26.151
You thought you could cram four years
of high school into a leaflet?

25:26.234 --> 25:27.319
No.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.505
Maybe you are as dumb as Stewart says.
Wait. No, no, no.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.673
Give me that.
No, I didn't think that.

25:30.697 --> 25:31.990
Go to the library then.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.200
You little scrawny midget!
I'll hold on to it.

25:34.284 --> 25:35.577
Mmm-hmm.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.622
I'm trippin'. I'm thinking along
the lines of traffic school.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.832
Look, come or not,
makes me no difference.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.250
I don't get paid
by the head.

25:42.959 --> 25:46.379
Or maybe you can find a night school
that does teach from a leaflet.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.549
You know of one that...
No, no. I'mma keep it.

25:50.925 --> 25:52.427
Have a good one.

25:53.053 --> 25:55.347
<i>Marv, I do not know
about this GED thing.</i>

25:55.889 --> 25:58.099
I don't, man.
The teacher is tough as hell.

25:58.183 --> 26:01.227
Hold on. Marv, let me hit you
back. Yo! Oh, shit!

26:01.311 --> 26:04.064
Hold up! Stop, stop!
What you doing?

26:04.147 --> 26:05.291
What does it
look like I'm doin'?

26:05.315 --> 26:08.735
It look like you towing my car.
Did I park in the handicap spot?

26:08.818 --> 26:10.671
You've missed the last four
payments on that car.

26:10.695 --> 26:11.696
It's gettin' repossessed.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.620
You gonna take my car
with my baby in the back?

26:13.948 --> 26:15.617
I don't see no goddamn
baby in there.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.785
The baby right there!

26:18.870 --> 26:19.996
You don't hear that?

26:20.080 --> 26:21.206
I don't think so.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.707
Hey, man! I said don't do it.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.585
I'm not playin'.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.462
Get out the way, dude!

26:27.545 --> 26:29.506
Stop, man! I got
my baby in here!

26:29.589 --> 26:30.799
The car is leaving.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.735
Get out the way, dude! Come on, man.
I'll show you leaving.

26:32.759 --> 26:33.999
I've got something
for your ass.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.375
Get out the car.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.641
Yeah!

26:40.684 --> 26:42.602
You wanna play that game?
Yeah!

26:42.686 --> 26:44.354
You wanna see something?
Come on, now!

26:47.941 --> 26:49.067
Bye!

26:49.567 --> 26:50.777
Dumbass.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.156
Glad y'all enjoyed the show.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.869
Tell my fiancée
I got in another accident.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.210
Uh...

27:08.378 --> 27:10.171
Carrie, right?
Oh...

27:10.463 --> 27:13.299
So even though we got textbook-sized
textbooks, you decided to join us.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.928
Well, grab a seat.
We'll get started in a few.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.013
Okay, before I do that...

27:19.097 --> 27:21.891
Now, I know we got off on the
wrong foot, so I was thinking,

27:21.975 --> 27:24.060
I didn't know if you had time
for dinner or not

27:24.144 --> 27:26.187
so I took it upon myself

27:26.271 --> 27:28.273
to go and get you one of
my personal favorites.

27:29.441 --> 27:30.841
It's the best Mexican
here in the A.

27:31.651 --> 27:34.112
Oh. Thank you. That is so
thoughtful of you, Teddy.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.489
So check this out.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.613
I went through some of your
old high school records.

27:39.159 --> 27:43.413
Math, Science, English.
You was a horrible student.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.332
What was going on with you then?
Was you being abused or something?

27:47.167 --> 27:50.170
Carrie, the thing with me is, I prefer
to use the world as my classroom.

27:50.670 --> 27:51.921
And to be honest with you,

27:53.965 --> 27:55.842
I'm not like
the rest of these folks.

27:56.968 --> 27:58.946
I'm just not what you would
call a "night school person."

27:58.970 --> 28:02.223
So I figure, maybe you and I
can look out for one another.

28:02.307 --> 28:03.850
You help me, I help you.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.518
You got my back,
I got your back.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.479
Whatever.
But it's just a conversation.

28:08.229 --> 28:11.024
Enjoy your tacos. That smile
can light up a room, can't it?

28:16.988 --> 28:18.490
I ain't going there.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.967
Remember me,
<i>pendejo?</i>

28:43.389 --> 28:45.725
Well, if it isn't Puby McGee.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.394
The cheesecake
puber is here, huh?

28:48.478 --> 28:50.146
Surprised to see me, bro?

28:50.230 --> 28:51.957
You shouldn't be, considering
that you got me fired.

28:51.981 --> 28:53.775
I did not get you fired.

28:53.858 --> 28:54.859
Yes, you did.

28:54.943 --> 28:56.703
I worked in customer service
for a long time.

28:56.778 --> 28:59.697
Everybody knows that the customer's
always right.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.367
Tips are my livelihood.
I had a 20 coming your way.

29:02.450 --> 29:03.993
The bill was $800.

29:04.118 --> 29:07.372
I had a buck sixty coming to me, man!
Okay. That's your fault!

29:07.455 --> 29:10.542
Okay, let's begin.
Who here likes tacos?

29:10.625 --> 29:12.627
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ooh.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.213
They vegetarian?

29:15.296 --> 29:17.056
'Cause I don't eat meat
unless it's barbecue.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.842
Let's see what
Teddy brought us.

29:18.925 --> 29:22.053
We got a carne asada.
There you go.

29:22.136 --> 29:23.721
There's al pastor.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.223
Oh, thanks.
You like that?

29:25.306 --> 29:27.767
Carnitas? You like carnitas?
There you go, girl.

29:29.310 --> 29:32.564
Excuse me, Carrie. I had actually
got those tacos for you to eat.

29:32.647 --> 29:33.857
I know.

29:33.940 --> 29:38.778
See, class, Teddy went to Cactus
House to try to win me over.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.948
But here's the deal, Teddy.
If you're trying to kiss my ass,

29:42.031 --> 29:43.676
you're gonna have to come a
little bit better than that.

29:43.700 --> 29:47.704
I'm talking, like, steamed lobster
inside of macaroni and cheese

29:47.787 --> 29:49.581
with a side of broccolini.

29:49.664 --> 29:51.416
You know what I'm saying?
Somethin' fancy!

29:51.499 --> 29:53.960
Not no fast food place
where I could go buy this

29:54.043 --> 29:55.545
with my own little
raggedy paycheck.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.549
Well, there's actually
a special guacamole...

29:59.632 --> 30:03.219
If you wanna
succeed in my class,

30:03.303 --> 30:05.763
you need to do the work.
It's just that simple.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.390
Yes?
Quick question.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.059
So "yes" on
the steamed lobster?

30:11.436 --> 30:14.606
No, sir. That's what I like to
call a teachable moment.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.858
Okay, so no lobster.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.445
All right, let's go ahead
and do some introductions.

30:20.528 --> 30:21.613
I'll start.

30:21.696 --> 30:22.906
My name is Carrie.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.033
During the day,
I teach way too many classes

30:25.116 --> 30:26.409
for way too little money.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.120
So I'm here to try to make
a little extra cash,

30:29.203 --> 30:33.833
so I can afford such luxuries
as rent and antibiotics

30:33.917 --> 30:36.920
'cause this job makes
me sick sometimes.

30:38.129 --> 30:40.506
You're next. Yes, you.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.929
What up, though?
Jaylen's the name.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.849
I've been working for the last 14
years at the MacArthur bottling plant

30:49.933 --> 30:51.643
and just got replaced
by a robot.

30:52.852 --> 30:56.481
And my rib, my Cleopatra,
my queen, my bottom bitch,

30:56.564 --> 30:59.192
my wife of 14 years,
she was like,

30:59.275 --> 31:02.111
"Yo, if you want options,
you gonna have to get your GED.

31:02.195 --> 31:05.740
"It's either that or end up cleaning rooms
at the Best Western for half your salary."

31:05.823 --> 31:08.284
And if you know Jay,
that ain't gonna work.

31:08.868 --> 31:12.747
Hey, let me just say this, okay,
while I got the platform.

31:13.706 --> 31:17.293
For me, I first got
woke when I seen <i>Terminator.</i>

31:18.211 --> 31:21.005
And I realized
it wasn't just a movie.

31:21.089 --> 31:22.840
It was prophecy.

31:22.924 --> 31:26.636
First identified by the 3.5 percenters,
but that's another conversation.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.304
Let's just put it like this.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.682
The revolution will
not be roboticized.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.141
Mmm-hmm.

31:32.225 --> 31:33.643
Not on Jay's watch.

31:35.353 --> 31:36.562
Real nigga shit.

31:37.271 --> 31:38.523
- What?
- Thank you, Jaylen.

31:38.606 --> 31:41.109
I'll make sure I don't bring
my Roomba to the next class.

31:42.026 --> 31:43.695
My wife take rumba classes.

31:43.778 --> 31:44.946
I don't get it.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.239
Let's keep it moving.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.824
How about you,
ma'am? Yeah.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.826
Oh. Okay.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.536
Hi, gang.
My name is Theresa,

31:51.619 --> 31:55.331
and I dropped out of high school when
I was pregnant with my first child.

31:55.415 --> 31:57.166
My now-husband, Randy,

31:57.250 --> 32:00.628
we got married after he knocked
me up, then we had two more kids.

32:00.712 --> 32:02.839
So we have three little
rascals now, and it's fun.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.590
We're just a little
underwater right now,

32:04.674 --> 32:07.510
so I wanted to get my GED and,
hopefully, enter the workforce.

32:07.593 --> 32:11.055
Before it's too late and we have to
live in Randy's parents' laundry room.

32:17.687 --> 32:20.523
I'm blessed.
So blessed!

32:20.982 --> 32:22.233
God is good.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.235
That's what's up.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.090
How about you,
young lady? Oh.

32:27.530 --> 32:29.615
Hey, what's up?
I'm Mila.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.075
I got kicked out
of my high school

32:31.159 --> 32:32.952
because they found some
Molly in my locker

32:33.036 --> 32:35.955
and I can avoid juvie
if I get my GED.

32:36.039 --> 32:38.249
So here I am.
I'm so psyched.

32:38.332 --> 32:39.459
Cool!

32:39.542 --> 32:42.587
Look at you, all cute,
making America great again.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.047
Bitch.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.716
So what's your
story, guy?

32:46.924 --> 32:51.012
My name is Luis Flores.
I had a great job as a waiter.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.972
A lot of money in tips

32:53.056 --> 32:55.725
until I was fired
without cause.

32:56.309 --> 32:57.435
No reason at all.

32:57.518 --> 32:58.770
Fired.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.649
I don't know why.
I have no idea why he's lookin' at me.

33:03.941 --> 33:05.151
It's fine.

33:05.234 --> 33:07.904
It's just a sign that it's time
for me to do something different.

33:08.362 --> 33:10.615
You see, I came to this
country from Mexico

33:10.698 --> 33:12.593
to fulfill my dream of
being a singer-songwriter.

33:12.617 --> 33:14.202
Oh, like Julio Iglesias?

33:14.285 --> 33:16.788
No, not like Julio Iglesias.

33:17.330 --> 33:18.414
He sucks.

33:19.373 --> 33:23.002
More like Justin Bieber
or Justin Timberlake.

33:23.086 --> 33:24.253
Or T-Pain.

33:26.339 --> 33:27.590
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.593
Aren't you a little old
to be a pop star now?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.220
Aren't you a little
young to die?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.223
That's what's up.

33:36.224 --> 33:39.811
But now I'm going to become
a dental hygienist.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.021
'Cause I have great teeth.

33:43.231 --> 33:44.690
So I think I'd be a natural.

33:45.608 --> 33:48.069
A what?
Dental hygienist.

33:49.779 --> 33:50.947
Maybe you should see one.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.367
'Cause you know what?
Pretty stinky, guys.

33:54.784 --> 33:56.828
All right! Hey, everybody,
I'm Mackenzie.

33:57.537 --> 33:58.579
They call me Big Mac.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.331
Oh. We love McDonald's.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.876
What?
McDonald's?

34:04.335 --> 34:05.336
I'm sorry, what?

34:05.670 --> 34:07.421
From the burger joint,
Mickey D's?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.216
Ronald McDonald's?

34:11.551 --> 34:14.178
Two all-beef patties,
special sauce, lettuce, cheese

34:14.512 --> 34:16.304
on a sesame seed bun?
Hmm...

34:16.806 --> 34:18.014
Never heard of it?

34:18.975 --> 34:20.351
Uh...

34:21.811 --> 34:24.688
Ooh.
It's gonna be a long semester.

34:25.481 --> 34:26.482
Go on.

34:26.565 --> 34:31.154
Well, anyway, my knees and
my back are really jacked up

34:31.237 --> 34:33.822
from working at He-Man
Movers for 30 years.

34:33.906 --> 34:36.659
So I decided to get my GED

34:36.742 --> 34:38.995
so that I could move up
to a management position.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.329
Get off the truck.

34:40.413 --> 34:44.500
And my son, we call him Little Mac,
he has decided to drop out of school.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.835
So I made
a deal with him.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.880
I get my GED,
he gets his diploma.

34:50.214 --> 34:51.966
Little reverse psychology!

34:52.717 --> 34:53.759
All right.

34:54.342 --> 34:55.594
And what's your name?

34:55.678 --> 34:57.054
<i>Hey, yo, what up? I'm Bobby.</i>

34:57.138 --> 34:58.890
That's what
I'm talking about.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.684
That's Illuminati!
That's what I'm saying!

35:01.767 --> 35:03.561
See, the nigga here,
but he ain't here!

35:03.644 --> 35:07.023
It's like they watchin' you and
you think you watchin' them!

35:07.106 --> 35:09.734
That's what they do!
So you got Bobby Digital.

35:09.817 --> 35:11.611
He here, but he not.

35:11.694 --> 35:14.071
That's Tupac Coachella.
You know what I'm saying?

35:14.947 --> 35:16.741
You see? Y'all don't...

35:16.824 --> 35:18.201
All right.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.244
That probably ain't even
a real nigga. Hey.

35:20.328 --> 35:22.455
Are you on crack? It's Skype.

35:22.830 --> 35:28.085
Ooh, boy, it's hard to be woke.
It's hard to be woke.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.464
What is "woke"?

35:31.547 --> 35:34.300
Okay, well,
welcome, everyone.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.010
Really nice, we've all met.

35:36.093 --> 35:38.888
We didn't meet everyone.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.056
I didn't...
Teddy.

35:40.514 --> 35:45.186
Earlier, you said, unlike these folks,
you're not a night school type of person.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.231
So I didn't think you cared.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.024
Is that right?

35:51.317 --> 35:53.110
You didn't hear it right,

35:53.194 --> 35:56.113
'cause I would never say that
about people that I don't know.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.907
You know what?
This is a perfect segue.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.826
I'll just follow your lead,
and I'll stand up.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.662
I am Teddy Walker.

36:02.745 --> 36:04.789
A little fun fact about me,
I actually went here.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.375
Oh.
I'm also newly engaged.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.168
His fiancée is
out of his league.

36:09.252 --> 36:10.378
I'm sorry, what?

36:10.461 --> 36:14.423
Nothing. You're doing great. I said,
"Keep going. Everybody loves you."

36:14.882 --> 36:17.260
How does your fiancée feel about
you being in night school?

36:17.343 --> 36:18.469
She good!

36:19.679 --> 36:20.680
She loves it!

36:21.305 --> 36:22.682
He ain't told her shit.

36:22.765 --> 36:23.933
She loves it!

36:24.475 --> 36:26.894
I noticed that your voice just
went up a whole octave.

36:27.436 --> 36:30.564
Now, from my studies of
psychology in grad school,

36:30.648 --> 36:33.192
I know that that means
that you're bullshitting.

36:33.276 --> 36:34.485
Ain't no bullshit in me.

36:35.653 --> 36:37.756
I tell you what, if you're lying
with her, don't lie to her.

36:37.780 --> 36:38.906
But I don't lie.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.449
<i>Sound like
some bullshit to me.</i>

36:40.574 --> 36:42.910
Everyone sees right through you.
Okay, how about we...

36:42.994 --> 36:45.288
If we go by your theory,
about the voice thing...

36:45.371 --> 36:47.081
I think that we're all
gettin' off track.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.165
He's lied four times.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.543
<i>This boy definitely lying.</i>
I am not.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.629
You can't outsmart Mother Nature.
And that's what a woman is.

36:53.713 --> 36:55.339
Brother.
Especially a black woman.

36:55.423 --> 36:56.716
That's correct.

36:56.799 --> 36:58.068
- Girls are smart, dude.
- Is she pretty?

36:58.092 --> 36:59.760
God damn it.
Like, literally, damn it.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.697
Even if he didn't tell her, so what?
Okay, here's the thing...

37:01.721 --> 37:04.473
I told Randy that he was the first
guy I slept with. Not true.

37:04.557 --> 37:06.183
I'm trying
to introduce myself...

37:06.267 --> 37:07.810
You don't respect your queen,

37:07.893 --> 37:09.371
'cause if you did, that bitch
would know where you at.

37:09.395 --> 37:12.273
Okay. Teddy. Don't lie
to your queen.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.357
Okay, guys.

37:13.441 --> 37:14.710
If you're busting off
in her guts like that,

37:14.734 --> 37:15.974
she might be
carrying your seed.

37:16.027 --> 37:17.254
I feel like this
conversation's...

37:17.278 --> 37:18.839
So you ain't just lyin' to her.
You lyin' to your child.

37:18.863 --> 37:19.905
Shit!

37:19.989 --> 37:22.009
If it's your bottom bitch,
she know you stupid, fam.

37:22.033 --> 37:23.135
All I'm sayin', fam...
Forget it.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.201
Okay!

37:24.285 --> 37:26.579
How your fiancée don't know
where you at? It's after dark.

37:26.662 --> 37:28.539
This ain't Halloween, fam.
I'm done.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.292
My sister know
where I'm at. Okay?

37:31.375 --> 37:33.336
And she live all the way
in Arkansas.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.546
Okay, here's the deal, class.

37:36.464 --> 37:40.301
You will be given homework every
night, just like regular high school.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.179
And now, a pop quiz

37:43.262 --> 37:46.682
just so I can get a better
idea of where you all are.

37:46.807 --> 37:48.809
Wait, we got a test
on the first day?

37:48.976 --> 37:53.147
Teddy, it's a pop quiz.
Okay? Look here, folks.

37:53.230 --> 37:56.484
I am here to teach
if you're here to learn.

37:56.567 --> 38:00.237
Otherwise, you can get
outta my class right now.

38:00.905 --> 38:02.198
That's what's up.

38:02.615 --> 38:04.408
Welcome to night school.

38:07.495 --> 38:08.579
There you go.

38:08.662 --> 38:11.582
It was terrible,
man! Terrible!

38:11.665 --> 38:14.210
Like, she's not like the teachers
that we had back in the day.

38:14.293 --> 38:16.253
<i>What?</i>
This woman is a brick wall.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.713
And I can't work her.

38:17.797 --> 38:19.965
I can't work a brick wall.

38:20.132 --> 38:21.175
What are you doing?

38:21.342 --> 38:23.142
I'm working out.
I'm trying to shed some lb's.

38:23.177 --> 38:25.429
<i>I wanna feel fit.</i>
Why am I even asking?

38:25.513 --> 38:27.640
<i>In the meantime, please
stop paying for everything</i>

38:27.723 --> 38:29.892
<i>and you have
to get a temp job.</i>

38:30.393 --> 38:32.853
You don't think I've been
looking for a job?

38:32.937 --> 38:34.939
<i>What are you, crazy?
I'm on a treadmill!</i>

38:35.022 --> 38:36.524
The jobs that I want,

38:36.607 --> 38:39.360
they are not going to give
to a high school dropout.

38:39.443 --> 38:42.613
<i>Well, you can't keep lying to Lisa.
Okay? You know what?</i>

38:42.696 --> 38:45.416
<i>I'm gonna go on Monster.com right
now, see if anything new popped up.</i>

38:45.449 --> 38:46.969
What are you gonna find on
Monster.com?

38:47.034 --> 38:48.661
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Okay, here we go.</i>

38:48.744 --> 38:51.872
<i>"Sales associate wanted,
marketing skills a must,"</i>

38:51.956 --> 38:54.750
<i>and, wait for it,
"no GED required."</i>

38:55.960 --> 38:58.045
<i>You gotta jump on this, man!
This is perfect!</i>

39:14.019 --> 39:15.938
It's chicken
from the Lord.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.482
So he made it?

39:18.649 --> 39:20.234
Yes, sir, he did.

39:21.861 --> 39:22.862
Yeah.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.738
I can work with this.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.907
You can?
Yeah.

39:27.491 --> 39:29.452
Basically, what
you wanna do,

39:29.952 --> 39:31.829
you wanna uplift
your customers' palate.

39:31.912 --> 39:32.955
Yes, sir.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.248
When they bite
into your food,

39:34.331 --> 39:37.626
you want their taste buds
to scream out "Hallelujah!"

39:37.710 --> 39:40.254
Preach it, Brother Teddy.
You are a godsend.

39:40.421 --> 39:43.048
I'm a salesman, man.
That's what I do, okay?

39:43.215 --> 39:45.468
Now, when it comes to titles,
I don't even care.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.219
Marketing director?
That's up to you.

39:47.303 --> 39:49.805
WWJD, at this point.
"What Would Jesus Do?"

39:49.889 --> 39:51.283
The one thing that I ask...
Yes, sir.

39:51.307 --> 39:52.617
Is for you to flexible
with the hours.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.143
'Cause I'm getting my GED.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.495
You are bettering yourself,
Brother Teddy.

39:55.519 --> 39:56.562
Yeah.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.123
That's what being a
Christian is all about.

39:58.147 --> 39:59.857
Yeah, amen to that.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.525
Amen!
Yeah.

40:01.609 --> 40:02.610
Glory be!

40:03.694 --> 40:05.154
This should
fit you perfectly.

40:06.238 --> 40:09.158
Brother Teddy, I have been
waiting on the Lord

40:09.241 --> 40:12.453
to bring me a pint-sized little
man like you to fill this out.

40:12.953 --> 40:14.622
And here you are.

40:16.624 --> 40:17.750
I'm not gonna do that.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.669
Brother Isaac,
I'm a black man.

40:21.212 --> 40:23.923
I can't put on
a chicken suit in 2018

40:24.340 --> 40:28.802
and stand on the side of a highway
and hawk no goddamn chicken.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.239
Now, if the marketing position
isn't what you had in mind,

40:31.263 --> 40:33.074
we can figure... What is going on?

40:33.098 --> 40:34.993
You know what? We're gonna
have to put a pin in that.

40:35.017 --> 40:36.977
Is that a fire drill?
All right, everybody.

40:37.061 --> 40:38.580
Let's gather 'round.
The hour's upon us.

40:38.604 --> 40:39.605
Where's the closest exit?

40:39.688 --> 40:41.649
It is time to pray.
It's time to what?

40:41.732 --> 40:43.567
It's time to pray.
Gather 'round.

40:44.026 --> 40:45.402
Goddamn. What's your deal?

40:45.569 --> 40:47.321
Hey, lady.
Dear Lord,

40:47.404 --> 40:50.074
we thank you for bringing little
Teddy to us here this morning.

40:50.157 --> 40:51.617
Yes, sir!
This little chickadee

40:51.700 --> 40:54.620
is gonna share the word about your
precious poultry with the world.

40:54.703 --> 40:58.207
What I'm not gonna do is do it in...
Ma'am! Ma'am!

40:58.290 --> 41:00.000
Strong hands!

41:00.292 --> 41:01.460
Excuse me!

41:01.835 --> 41:04.630
What I'm not gonna do is do
it in a chicken... Goddamn!

41:04.713 --> 41:05.798
Brother Teddy.

41:05.881 --> 41:08.217
He's in you.
He's in you, ain't he?

41:08.300 --> 41:09.468
Chicken suit or not,

41:09.551 --> 41:11.345
we are all praying together
right now

41:11.428 --> 41:13.406
that you're gonna find your
nest here with us today.

41:13.430 --> 41:15.641
Okay.
Amen! And Amen.

41:15.724 --> 41:17.142
Amen!

41:18.060 --> 41:20.938
Amen! Yes, sir!
Welcome, Brother Teddy.

41:21.021 --> 41:22.690
All right, everybody.
This is a big day.

41:22.773 --> 41:23.875
Hey, brother, let me
holler at you real quick.

41:23.899 --> 41:25.001
Are y'all in the Sunken Place?

41:25.025 --> 41:26.860
Let's share Jesus through our food.
Let's go!

41:27.403 --> 41:28.487
The lunch rush is upon us.

41:28.696 --> 41:30.823
What, lunch rush?
It's 10:00 a.m.

41:31.740 --> 41:34.140
I don't understand how that could
be considered a lunch rush.

41:34.702 --> 41:35.703
Trust me, Brother Teddy.

41:35.828 --> 41:38.223
Okay. If there... If there's any way
that I can just talk to you about...

41:38.247 --> 41:39.748
Good morning, ladies.

41:40.416 --> 41:42.293
Hello, Cinnamon. Roxanne.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.087
Hello, ladies.
How was the shift?

41:45.170 --> 41:46.547
Hollywood,
how you doin'?

41:46.630 --> 41:48.173
Good to see you, lady.

41:48.257 --> 41:50.342
Hello, Veronica.
How was your shift?

41:50.426 --> 41:52.553
Roxy. Good to see you.

41:52.636 --> 41:53.887
All right, then.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.975
That'll be $14.99.
How would you like to pay?

42:02.396 --> 42:03.540
Now, from your
first night of homework,

42:03.564 --> 42:07.693
you all should be very familiar
with the Pythagorean theorem.

42:07.776 --> 42:08.944
All right? Say it with me.

42:09.028 --> 42:10.029
"Pythagorean."

42:10.112 --> 42:11.256
"Pythagorean theorem."
"Pythagorium."

42:11.280 --> 42:12.323
"Pythigorinian."

42:12.406 --> 42:13.532
- "Theorem."
- "Theorem."

42:13.615 --> 42:14.658
"Theorem."

42:14.742 --> 42:16.785
That's how you say it.
That's what it is.

42:16.869 --> 42:18.454
Hey, yo! Bobby,
watch out, fam!

42:18.537 --> 42:19.621
My God.

42:19.955 --> 42:21.248
<i>Get him!</i>

42:21.332 --> 42:22.916
Oh!
Oh!

42:23.876 --> 42:24.877
Bobby got skills.

42:25.461 --> 42:26.461
Oh!

42:26.545 --> 42:28.672
- Shit!
<i>- Can't you see I'm tryin' to learn?</i>

42:28.756 --> 42:30.424
Someone ought to
call the cops!

42:30.507 --> 42:31.759
What's happening?

42:35.262 --> 42:37.431
- Jesus!
<i>- Get off me! Get off me!</i>

42:37.514 --> 42:38.742
He's gettin' up!
He's gettin' up!

42:38.766 --> 42:40.225
Watch out, fam!
Behind you, nigga!

42:42.186 --> 42:44.271
- He just kicked him in the...
- Oh, my God!

42:44.355 --> 42:45.564
Right in the...

42:49.026 --> 42:50.694
Enough!
Finish him! Step on his head!

42:51.570 --> 42:53.572
<i>- Come here! Come on!
- Break it up!</i>

42:55.866 --> 42:57.177
<i>- Come on!
- Hey, man!</i>

42:57.201 --> 42:58.202
<i>I didn't do shit!</i>

42:58.744 --> 43:02.081
That's the stuff right there.
Reminds me of the old days.

43:05.626 --> 43:08.337
<i>They had the wrong guy.
Please continue.</i>

43:08.420 --> 43:10.714
You sure you cool,
or do we need to just chill

43:10.798 --> 43:12.257
and wait for you
to make a new shank?

43:12.591 --> 43:17.346
<i>Please continue
with the Pythagorean theorium.</i>

43:17.846 --> 43:19.223
Okay.

43:20.015 --> 43:21.534
You know what
we ought to do for Bobby?

43:21.558 --> 43:23.769
We should get him,
like, some smokes.

43:23.852 --> 43:25.580
'Cause that stuff is like
currency in prison.

43:25.604 --> 43:26.772
That and ass.

43:26.855 --> 43:28.023
Okay, here we go.

43:28.107 --> 43:30.692
So, this is what we call
a right triangle.

43:30.776 --> 43:34.321
And we already know the value
of two sides of the triangle.

43:34.405 --> 43:39.326
That should make it very easy for
us to calculate the hypotenuse.

43:39.410 --> 43:43.414
A-squared plus b-squared
equals c-squared.

43:43.497 --> 43:44.748
Say that with me, guys.

43:44.832 --> 43:49.837
"A-squared plus b-squared
equals c-squared."

43:49.920 --> 43:51.088
Very good.

43:51.547 --> 43:53.525
Teddy, you seem to be getting
a real kick out of this.

43:53.549 --> 43:55.509
<i>She got you, Teddy!</i>

43:55.843 --> 43:57.678
You wanna come up
and solve the problem?

43:58.095 --> 43:59.346
Busted!

44:04.435 --> 44:05.978
If that's what
you want me to do.

44:06.061 --> 44:07.229
Come on up.

44:07.312 --> 44:09.106
Come on,
Teddy, you got this.

44:09.189 --> 44:12.860
You got this, Teddy.
Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

44:12.943 --> 44:14.403
Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

44:22.703 --> 44:24.955
Find the value of "c."

44:38.260 --> 44:39.386
You know what?

44:42.806 --> 44:44.224
I think there's
something in here.

44:47.102 --> 44:50.272
Yo, yo, yo!
What up, my night school?

44:51.648 --> 44:52.900
Who you lookin'
for, fam?

44:54.067 --> 44:58.530
I am the principal of this high school.
And I'm just dropping by to check on...

45:00.032 --> 45:01.450
What is he doing here?

45:02.826 --> 45:04.666
I'm studying to get my GED
like everybody else.

45:05.579 --> 45:08.749
So, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to learning.

45:11.043 --> 45:12.127
Of course.

45:12.211 --> 45:13.396
My apologies for interrupting.

45:13.420 --> 45:14.755
Thank you.

45:15.881 --> 45:19.968
Actually, I would like to observe
for a minute, if that's okay.

45:20.719 --> 45:23.096
Please, continue
solving the problem.

45:23.639 --> 45:25.182
Forget I'm here.

45:26.433 --> 45:27.434
Cool.

45:28.602 --> 45:30.270
That's fine with me.

45:30.354 --> 45:33.482
Okay, so if we're gonna do this,
let's do it step by step.

45:33.565 --> 45:34.765
Let's make sure
we do it right.

45:35.359 --> 45:37.199
First things first,
let's get rid of this line.

45:38.570 --> 45:39.947
Because it's written sloppy.

45:40.030 --> 45:41.865
So let's get that baby neat.
Eight!

45:41.949 --> 45:43.408
Right?
Huh.

45:43.492 --> 45:46.036
We got these three sides.
Got a, b, c. Split that.

45:46.119 --> 45:48.455
That's there.
Take these twos away.

45:48.539 --> 45:49.790
<i>He don't know the answer!</i>

45:49.873 --> 45:51.750
Because that's
what confuses you.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.835
And then,

45:54.836 --> 45:56.463
you're realizing what it is.
Eight!

45:56.547 --> 45:57.798
The answer's five.

45:58.632 --> 46:03.053
It's five. Easy. Okay, you're
looking at five squared.

46:03.136 --> 46:06.306
Me up here, I don't have time.
I don't have time.

46:06.390 --> 46:08.016
Why do I even
waste my time?

46:08.100 --> 46:09.827
I don't got time to waste my
time on the Pythagorean theorem.

46:09.851 --> 46:11.019
- It's simple.
- Wow.

46:11.103 --> 46:14.231
That is very
impressive, Teddy.

46:14.314 --> 46:15.983
Very impressive!

46:16.733 --> 46:19.027
I look forward to seeing
how you do on the midterm.

46:19.403 --> 46:21.238
My midterm.

46:21.321 --> 46:22.489
All right.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.033
Are we done here,
Stewart?

46:25.117 --> 46:27.387
Or do you wanna teach the rest
of the class for the night?

46:27.411 --> 46:28.787
Carry on, Carrie.

46:29.162 --> 46:30.831
I don't like his attitude.

46:31.123 --> 46:32.457
You all have
a wonderful class.

46:35.085 --> 46:36.545
What?

46:36.628 --> 46:39.214
God,
that guy is a douchebag.

46:39.298 --> 46:43.468
Are we just gonna gloss over the fact
that we just watched a prison fight?

46:44.720 --> 46:46.906
How many classes do we have left?
That was weird, right?

46:46.930 --> 46:48.616
I actually have to work
for four hours right now.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.891
I don't know if I'm into this.

46:49.975 --> 46:52.060
I can give you a ride home
for 10 bucks if you want.

46:52.144 --> 46:53.854
Hey, Carrie! Hey!

46:53.937 --> 46:55.022
Whew.

46:55.981 --> 46:58.459
That was real cool, what you did
for me in there at the blackboard.

46:58.483 --> 46:59.669
You know, that's what
I was talking about

46:59.693 --> 47:01.838
when I just said watchin' out
for each other, you know?

47:01.862 --> 47:03.447
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

47:03.530 --> 47:05.657
There's not gonna be any
more back-scratching, Teddy.

47:05.741 --> 47:07.492
That's the last time
that happens.

47:07.576 --> 47:09.936
And what was really going on
with you at the board, anyways?

47:10.621 --> 47:11.663
Nothing.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.375
Nothing! No, I was just...
I wasn't prepared.

47:15.459 --> 47:17.377
If you're not gonna do the work,
drop the class.

47:17.461 --> 47:19.171
Why would you...
No, Carrie! Hey!

47:19.254 --> 47:21.381
I'mma do the work.
You'll see.

47:21.465 --> 47:23.216
We'll see.
Yes, we will.

47:23.300 --> 47:24.885
Great!
Superb!

47:24.968 --> 47:26.386
Excellent!
Good!

47:26.470 --> 47:28.180
Mmm-hmm.

47:33.894 --> 47:35.020
Shit!

47:35.771 --> 47:37.606
Honey, I'm home!

47:42.527 --> 47:43.570
You sleepin'?

47:45.322 --> 47:46.323
You up?

47:56.166 --> 47:58.001
Excuse me!

47:58.669 --> 48:00.587
Booty look good, don't it?

48:00.671 --> 48:04.216
Too bad your face gonna be in between
them books and not them cheeks.

48:05.801 --> 48:07.094
Go study!

48:09.346 --> 48:10.389
I don't wanna study!

48:12.015 --> 48:13.183
Mmm.

48:17.104 --> 48:18.730
Come on, Teddy. Focus!

48:18.814 --> 48:21.149
Focus, Teddy! Focus!

48:24.820 --> 48:26.154
You'll never get it!

48:26.530 --> 48:27.739
Give me it back!

48:28.198 --> 48:30.033
Hey, guy.
This is my demo.

48:30.117 --> 48:31.386
<i>No matter what it takes</i>

48:31.410 --> 48:34.121
<i>You know I'm always gonna
keep on fighting</i>

48:37.624 --> 48:39.710
Little Mac!
What are you doing?

48:39.793 --> 48:41.062
It's my phone.
Those were my notes.

48:41.086 --> 48:42.963
You should be studying.
What the hell?

48:43.046 --> 48:44.756
Don't be such a dick!

48:44.840 --> 48:46.633
You're gonna study!
I hate you!

48:47.634 --> 48:48.861
What's the circumference
of that pizza?

48:48.885 --> 48:49.928
The diameter?

48:50.011 --> 48:52.222
Just tell me how many
pepperonis are on the pizza.

48:52.305 --> 48:53.682
I'm giving you one star.

48:53.765 --> 48:56.435
I'm gonna drop you off here in a
bad neighborhood. How 'bout that?

48:56.601 --> 48:59.688
Theresa!
It's after 10:00! Hello!

49:00.147 --> 49:02.774
That's my Randy.
Sweetest guy on Earth.

49:02.858 --> 49:04.943
Does anybody else wanna try
to take a crack at this?

49:05.026 --> 49:06.987
I'm kinda busy right now.
Mmm.

49:07.112 --> 49:08.447
Babe, you seen my white-out?

49:09.364 --> 49:12.284
What the?
Oh, hell no! Trina!

49:12.367 --> 49:15.662
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
you got robotic side dick now?

49:15.996 --> 49:17.289
"Fat asses."

49:17.372 --> 49:19.291
You know what fat asses like?

49:19.374 --> 49:21.209
Dudes that have a real job.

49:21.293 --> 49:23.545
<i>Teddy!</i>
Get your ass out.

49:23.628 --> 49:27.215
<i>Teddy, if you don't pass that midterm,
no way homegirl stays with you.</i>

49:27.299 --> 49:28.425
Huh.

49:28.884 --> 49:30.385
<i>Think about that.</i>

49:30.802 --> 49:32.029
We're gonna have to
steal the test.

49:32.053 --> 49:33.138
Whoa.

49:33.221 --> 49:35.724
Mind meld. I was thinking
the exact same thing.

49:36.141 --> 49:38.935
If we being real with it,
I need as much help as I can get.

49:39.644 --> 49:42.481
Goin' from cappin' bottles
to hypotenuses and all that,

49:42.564 --> 49:46.109
I'm just as confounded by the materials
as the rest of y'all. Feel me?

49:46.860 --> 49:49.988
I really hate to admit it,
but with the language barrier

49:50.071 --> 49:52.324
and all the Lyft driving
I've been doing,

49:52.407 --> 49:53.867
I'm struggling as well, guys.

49:54.367 --> 49:56.244
I think
a caper sounds fun.

49:58.497 --> 49:59.790
When did you
get here, Theresa?

50:00.415 --> 50:01.833
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

50:02.751 --> 50:05.253
People never notice me.
It happens all the time.

50:05.337 --> 50:07.005
It's kinda like a super power

50:07.088 --> 50:10.133
but one that comes
with a crushing loneliness.

50:14.221 --> 50:16.181
I'm blessed. I'm so blessed.

50:17.015 --> 50:18.850
Yeah, God is good.
Mmm-hmm.

50:19.643 --> 50:20.685
Okay.

50:21.478 --> 50:23.063
Mila, what about you?

50:23.355 --> 50:26.274
My parents are gonna be really
pissed if I get busted again.

50:27.776 --> 50:29.027
Yeah, I'm in.

50:29.110 --> 50:30.421
- I'm in. That's what I'm talkin' about!
- All right.

50:30.445 --> 50:32.447
I just have one question
before we do this.

50:32.531 --> 50:33.782
What's up?

50:33.865 --> 50:36.117
Why does Teddy get
to be the ring leader, guys?

50:36.201 --> 50:37.702
- Come on!
- God damn it, Luis.

50:37.786 --> 50:38.912
I mean, seriously, man?

50:38.995 --> 50:41.915
It was his idea. He knows the
school better than any of us.

50:42.749 --> 50:44.459
Just never mind the fact

50:44.543 --> 50:47.921
that I snuck into
a little place called America.

50:48.088 --> 50:51.258
That's true!
Luis is hot tonight!

51:27.752 --> 51:29.296
Yo, T.
What?

51:29.379 --> 51:32.549
I appreciate you bringing this
amazing, blazing, Satan chicken.

51:32.632 --> 51:34.217
It's like it's hot,
but it's not.

51:34.301 --> 51:36.052
And I don't like spicy food,
but this one...

51:36.720 --> 51:39.222
Let me tell you what else
is hot. Your breath.

51:39.931 --> 51:42.350
Why are you breathing on the
side of my face like that?

51:42.434 --> 51:44.269
You smackin' all
in my ear, man. Stop.

51:46.688 --> 51:49.149
You still smacking. God damn it,
you're done. You're done.

51:49.274 --> 51:51.693
You're done with that.
Really?

51:52.903 --> 51:55.363
God! What is your problem, man?
What?

51:55.447 --> 51:57.367
I said wear all black.
Why didn't you wear black?

51:57.741 --> 51:59.910
Laundry day.
All my darks were in the wash.

51:59.993 --> 52:01.161
So you wore yellow?

52:01.453 --> 52:02.621
It's fresh. It's clean.

52:02.704 --> 52:04.581
Get your arm out my face.

52:04.789 --> 52:05.999
Get out of my face.

52:06.374 --> 52:08.627
Focus! Let's go!
Let's go!

52:11.171 --> 52:13.048
<i>Yo, Teddy,
what's the play, man?</i>

52:13.214 --> 52:15.443
Last night, I saw the
janitor cleaning Stewart's office

52:15.467 --> 52:16.718
around 8:00 p.m.

52:17.177 --> 52:19.095
<i>I get it.
That's the inside man, huh?</i>

52:19.179 --> 52:22.098
No, Bobby. He's not my
inside man, he's the janitor.

52:27.103 --> 52:28.104
Oh, shit.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.607
What? I gotta take this.
I gotta take it.

52:31.066 --> 52:32.233
Shit, shit.

52:32.943 --> 52:33.985
Uh...

52:35.153 --> 52:38.490
No, no, no.
That don't... Shit.

52:42.035 --> 52:43.036
Hey, babe.

52:43.119 --> 52:46.706
<i>Hey, baby. I miss you.
Are you still at work?</i>

52:46.998 --> 52:50.460
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Right now I'm
in the, I'm in the break room.

52:51.211 --> 52:52.587
<i>Can I get a tour
of the office?</i>

52:52.671 --> 52:55.090
If my baby wants a tour,
then she can get a tour.

52:55.173 --> 52:57.092
You always wanna
see somethin'. If I...

52:57.175 --> 52:58.677
Oh, Teddy.
Hey.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.720
Teddy, oh, we got
a situation here.

53:00.804 --> 53:01.989
- Actually...
- We got a real...

53:02.013 --> 53:04.307
Well, okay. Boy.
Hot lava. Hot lava! Okay.

53:04.432 --> 53:06.434
Um...
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

53:07.769 --> 53:09.705
Turtle head sticking out.
Oh, that's a big one.

53:09.729 --> 53:10.772
Uh...

53:10.897 --> 53:12.458
- Wait, what is going on over there?
<i>- Big shit.</i>

53:12.482 --> 53:15.777
I mean, that's actually
one of my account managers.

53:15.860 --> 53:16.987
Whoo!

53:17.070 --> 53:19.948
Personalities all over
the office. Non-stop laughs.

53:20.031 --> 53:21.700
Hot lava!
Non-stops.

53:21.783 --> 53:24.619
You know how people
play around at the office.

53:25.912 --> 53:26.913
Who's...

53:26.997 --> 53:29.332
<i>Hey, yo, what's up, bro?
You hung up on me, man.</i>

53:29.416 --> 53:30.417
<i>Who's that?</i>

53:30.500 --> 53:33.128
That's one of my clients,
there. Right there.

53:33.211 --> 53:35.171
Yeah, we were
going over his portfolio...

53:35.255 --> 53:36.315
Kinda looks like
he's in prison.

53:36.339 --> 53:39.676
<i>Oh, my God.
You so beautiful, baby.</i>

53:39.759 --> 53:42.679
Well, he looks like that
'cause he is. Insider trading.

53:42.762 --> 53:44.472
He was wrongfully accused.

53:44.556 --> 53:47.308
<i>You lookin' like J-Lo
and Beyoncé, mama.</i>

53:47.392 --> 53:49.144
<i>You mind showin' me
your privates?</i>

53:49.227 --> 53:50.478
Enough, Bobby!

53:50.562 --> 53:53.374
<i>Like, turn around, let me see that ass.
Please, a little tit, somethin'.</i>

53:53.398 --> 53:54.399
Excuse me?

53:54.482 --> 53:56.401
<i>I'm, like,
really strong right now,</i>

53:56.484 --> 53:58.987
<i>like, I could do things
to you. Legendary shit.</i>

53:59.070 --> 54:00.071
Enough, Bobby.

54:00.155 --> 54:03.992
<i>I'll take some upper thigh, but for
real, I really want to see some punani.</i>

54:04.075 --> 54:05.160
Excuse me?

54:05.243 --> 54:07.078
Listen... Oh, my God!

54:07.203 --> 54:09.372
I don't know what you put in me...
It just hit me!

54:09.456 --> 54:10.641
...but it feels like
the devil!

54:10.665 --> 54:12.834
It just hit me
what he said, honey.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.169
He's saying "piñata."

54:14.252 --> 54:16.296
<i>Man, I ain't see
some punani in so long.</i>

54:16.379 --> 54:17.881
Bobby likes to hit piñatas!

54:19.174 --> 54:21.094
You know what I'm gonna do?
Let me call you back.

54:21.176 --> 54:23.845
I love you. And I'll...
We'll do the tour when I'm done.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.055
<i>Bye, babe.</i>

54:26.306 --> 54:28.725
What was that, Bobby?
<i>Your tail good lookin', bro.</i>

54:28.808 --> 54:31.728
That's my fiancée, man.
You don't talk to her like that.

54:31.811 --> 54:35.148
<i>When I go back to the cell,
I got the legendary socky-sock.</i>

54:35.231 --> 54:37.567
You're not havin'
a sock session to my woman.

54:37.650 --> 54:38.902
That's not gonna happen.

54:38.985 --> 54:40.528
<i>I'm goin' all out.</i>

54:41.738 --> 54:44.365
Okay, what is
in your ass, Mac?

54:44.449 --> 54:46.576
Cut me a break, man!
I've had enough!

54:49.496 --> 54:52.874
Hold on a second.
We got a code red. We got a code red.

54:52.957 --> 54:54.751
Teddy, I got
no toilet paper.

54:54.834 --> 54:56.836
Toilet paper, Teddy!
One-time me!

54:57.337 --> 54:59.506
One-time me. Teddy!

55:05.303 --> 55:06.513
All right, guys, listen.

55:07.180 --> 55:09.349
When the janitor exits,
we're gonna go out.

55:09.432 --> 55:12.143
We're gonna catch the door,
and then we're gonna enter quietly.

55:12.352 --> 55:13.436
Okay.
Okay?

55:14.854 --> 55:15.897
Wait a minute.

55:16.856 --> 55:18.024
Where's Big Mac?

55:18.608 --> 55:20.110
I thought
he was with us!

55:22.570 --> 55:23.571
Damn it!

55:29.369 --> 55:30.745
What's he doing?

55:36.209 --> 55:37.252
Oh, my God!
What are you...

55:38.086 --> 55:39.921
Come on, come on.
Mac!

55:42.173 --> 55:43.633
Holy shit! It worked!

55:43.716 --> 55:44.717
Oh, my God!

55:45.301 --> 55:46.928
Mac!
Did you just kill him?

55:47.011 --> 55:48.972
No, I didn't kill him.
I just choked him out.

55:49.430 --> 55:51.432
You said no witnesses!
When did I say that?

55:51.724 --> 55:52.976
You didn't say that?

55:53.977 --> 55:57.355
Oh, God! You know what?
I got my signals crossed.

55:57.438 --> 55:59.232
There's a lot of instructions,
Teddy.

55:59.399 --> 56:02.235
I didn't say anything about...
You know what?

56:02.318 --> 56:03.653
You are gonna fix this.

56:03.736 --> 56:05.297
Do you hear me, Mac?
You're gonna hide this body.

56:05.321 --> 56:06.322
Chop him up?

56:06.823 --> 56:08.199
Hide.
Burn it?

56:08.783 --> 56:10.493
Hide it.
Chop, burn, bury?

56:13.121 --> 56:15.081
Hey, anybody got anything?
No.

56:16.457 --> 56:17.977
All right, Mila,
how we lookin'?

56:19.169 --> 56:21.421
Keep looking!
Hands up, suckers!

56:22.630 --> 56:23.631
Shit!

56:23.798 --> 56:25.842
You should've seen your face.
You looked ridiculous!

56:25.925 --> 56:27.093
Shh.

56:27.177 --> 56:28.529
All right,
I stashed the body.

56:28.553 --> 56:30.593
And God willing, he'll wake up
in a couple of hours.

56:30.722 --> 56:34.100
Also, that baseball coach slash
principal guy, he's on his way.

56:34.184 --> 56:36.019
What? Why wouldn't
you lead with that?

56:40.064 --> 56:42.150
Damn! It's the PTA meeting.

56:42.817 --> 56:44.152
Oh, shit!

56:46.446 --> 56:47.572
Theresa, you're up.

56:47.655 --> 56:48.865
What?
Listen to me.

56:48.948 --> 56:50.992
I need you to go out there,
and I need you to stall.

56:51.075 --> 56:53.244
No, no, no. I can't flirt.
I don't know any moves.

56:53.328 --> 56:55.014
I don't need that.
I haven't flirted since 1996,

56:55.038 --> 56:57.391
and even then it was, like,
offering to give the cop my panties

56:57.415 --> 56:59.018
to get off a speeding ticket
and guess what?

56:59.042 --> 57:00.144
He didn't take it.
I'm bad at it.

57:00.168 --> 57:01.437
That's not what I'm
asking you to do.

57:01.461 --> 57:04.088
In my day, it was really innocent.
Now it's all about the butt.

57:04.172 --> 57:08.509
I heard a guy the other day say "I'm
gonna crack that up like a walnut."

57:08.593 --> 57:10.303
What?
What does that even mean?

57:10.386 --> 57:11.846
Why would you start there?
Stop!

57:11.971 --> 57:13.991
Wouldn't you wanna start in the front?
Theresa, listen.

57:14.015 --> 57:17.310
With a nice missionary position, you know?
Some gentle touching.

57:17.393 --> 57:20.647
In my day, maybe once in your lifetime,
you might get the end of a pinky

57:20.730 --> 57:22.208
and that was the thrill
of a lifetime, okay?

57:22.232 --> 57:23.233
Stop it.

57:23.316 --> 57:25.735
That's a lot of information
that I did not need to know.

57:25.818 --> 57:27.987
Yeah, that was a lot.
Go talk about bake sales.

57:28.071 --> 57:29.751
Mom stuff. Not butt stuff.
Yeah, mom stuff.

57:29.781 --> 57:32.200
Go mom it. Let's go.
I'll try. I'll try.

57:32.283 --> 57:33.409
Okay? Okay.
I can do that.

57:33.493 --> 57:35.203
Got it.
Go! Go!

57:35.286 --> 57:36.537
Shit! Luis.

57:36.621 --> 57:38.515
Go out there before she does
something with her butt.

57:38.539 --> 57:39.916
Okay.
Okay?

57:44.629 --> 57:46.589
What are you doing, Mac?
Looking for trapdoors.

57:49.884 --> 57:51.094
I'm glad you're here, Mac.

57:51.177 --> 57:52.262
Send it to me
first, please.

57:52.345 --> 57:53.822
Right, right.
We can email you directly.

57:53.846 --> 57:55.199
- Thank you.
- That would be great.

57:55.223 --> 57:57.493
Send out that email tonight, okay?
Thanks so much. Okay. Bye!

57:57.517 --> 57:59.519
Drive home safe.
Oh, hey!

58:00.436 --> 58:01.479
Hi.

58:01.562 --> 58:03.481
Thank you for that great,
wonderful meeting.

58:03.564 --> 58:04.983
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

58:05.066 --> 58:06.943
I was in there.
Remember?

58:07.652 --> 58:10.113
Yes, yes, yes.
Hi. Mrs. Howerton.

58:10.196 --> 58:11.948
Mrs. Howerton.
Yes, of course.

58:12.031 --> 58:14.367
No, you brought up
several compelling issues.

58:14.450 --> 58:15.535
I sure did.

58:15.618 --> 58:16.887
Well, what can
I help you with?

58:16.911 --> 58:19.163
She sucks at this. Hurry!
I'm almost there.

58:19.247 --> 58:22.208
So my child gets an assignment
about the solar system,

58:22.292 --> 58:23.793
and it's to make
a diorama.

58:23.876 --> 58:25.479
And he doesn't know how
to make a diorama.

58:25.503 --> 58:27.356
I'm the one with the hot glue
gun in the middle of the night.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.607
It's 11:00 p.m.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

58:28.631 --> 58:30.025
We're blessed to go to
school here, but I'm...

58:30.049 --> 58:31.151
I'm sorry,
I have to go.

58:31.175 --> 58:32.593
Okay? Call my office.
Hurry up!

58:32.719 --> 58:34.196
I will. I'm going, I'm going.
Calm down.

58:34.220 --> 58:35.763
Come on, Mila!

58:35.847 --> 58:38.766
You've made some great points, but
I have to go now. Good night.

58:39.809 --> 58:41.019
Wait a minute!

58:41.102 --> 58:42.895
Thank you. I have to go.
I really have to go.

58:42.979 --> 58:44.480
Wait! No! Wait, wait, wait!
What?

58:45.732 --> 58:47.942
Are you okay?
I feel faint.

58:48.026 --> 58:49.226
Well, let's get you
some water.

58:49.819 --> 58:52.572
Thanks for catching me.
Of course. Are you all right?

58:55.950 --> 58:57.326
Are you having a seizure?

58:59.829 --> 59:01.372
Do you have something
in your teeth?

59:01.456 --> 59:02.957
I wish I had you in my teeth.

59:03.041 --> 59:06.544
No, no, no, no. Okay. No. I didn't
realize that's what this was.

59:06.627 --> 59:08.254
No, thank you. Ma'am.
Gentle touching!

59:08.337 --> 59:10.607
I am the principal of your child's school.
I have to walk away now.

59:10.631 --> 59:11.692
I am in a loveless
marriage. Please.

59:11.716 --> 59:12.925
I am not
participating in this!

59:13.009 --> 59:14.486
You don't have to participate.
Too unprofessional.

59:14.510 --> 59:16.929
I'll do all the work.
I'll do it all. No, I'm...

59:17.055 --> 59:19.265
If you just look me in the eyes...
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

59:19.348 --> 59:20.433
Not appropriate, okay?

59:20.516 --> 59:22.602
Okay. Here it is.
If this is what you want.

59:22.685 --> 59:23.829
This is what
it's about with you.

59:23.853 --> 59:25.313
No, no, no, no!
I am not looking.

59:25.396 --> 59:27.982
Crack it open like a walnut.
Thank you. No, thank you.

59:28.066 --> 59:30.318
Crack that nut like a walnut.
Thank you. No, thank you.

59:30.401 --> 59:33.404
Crack that nut open!
Thank you. No, thank you.

59:33.488 --> 59:36.157
Do what men do with women's asses.
Oh, man!

59:36.240 --> 59:37.634
Just tap it!
I can't stand here for this, okay?

59:37.658 --> 59:39.202
Give it a rat-tat-tap!
Good night!

59:42.163 --> 59:43.498
Oh, that was so hard.

59:44.082 --> 59:45.792
She wanted you so bad.

59:46.709 --> 59:48.127
But you can't go there.

59:49.003 --> 59:51.047
Principals have principles.

59:53.091 --> 59:56.761
Oh, but you know Stewie would've
tore that ass up though!

59:57.804 --> 59:59.347
Not a black voice.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:44.892
Hello?

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:46.686
Hello?

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.354
Somebody in here?

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:55.695
I have a bat

01:00:56.529 --> 01:00:57.947
and I'm not afraid to use it.

01:00:59.157 --> 01:01:02.618
If there is someone in here,
you are trespassing

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.663
and I am well within
my rights

01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:08.291
to defend myself.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:13.379
So come on out,
and I won't bash your head.

01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:16.549
Help!

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:18.593
Anybody out there?

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:24.724
Get me out of here! Hey!

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.809
Whoa!

01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:28.269
Okay.
What the hell, Mac?

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.688
- That was close.
- You're damn right it was, Mac.

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:31.939
I wonder why.

01:01:32.023 --> 01:01:33.608
Yeah. It's 'cause I sneezed.

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:35.026
I know what you did.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:37.069
What?
I got it.

01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:42.283
I really tried.
I even did the butt stuff.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.035
I told you
don't do the butt stuff.

01:01:44.118 --> 01:01:45.262
I don't know, fam.
It might have worked.

01:01:45.286 --> 01:01:47.526
It looked like he might've
sauced his drawers, real talk.

01:01:47.914 --> 01:01:49.665
He what?
He was turned on.

01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:52.126
Really?
Shit, I was, too.

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:53.294
Hey!

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:54.378
Thanks, Jaylen.

01:01:54.462 --> 01:01:56.302
You've got that little
eco-friendly vibe going.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.715
What's "eco-friendly"?

01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:59.050
Very little waist.

01:01:59.342 --> 01:02:01.093
Oh, I thought
you meant her bush.

01:02:01.177 --> 01:02:03.512
No. Oh, you know what?
I'm with that.

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:05.139
Hey, now!

01:02:05.223 --> 01:02:06.682
Okay, Jaylen, Jaylen!

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.059
We gotta go, y'all. Let's go.

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:09.518
Yeah, let's go.
Come on. Come on.

01:02:09.602 --> 01:02:10.603
Shit.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.526
Who's out there?

01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:19.654
Somebody help me, please.

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:23.658
What happened?

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:24.742
I don't know.

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:27.221
Someone grabbed me from behind
and threw me in the slop sink.

01:02:27.245 --> 01:02:29.288
Game face, Lonnie.

01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:31.791
We're on lockdown.

01:02:31.874 --> 01:02:34.126
Yeah!

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.970
That'll get him. Hey!

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:37.797
Oh, shit!
Go, go, go!

01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:39.298
Shit!

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.885
What are we...
Hey! Shit!

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:47.348
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, shit just
got real, man, what do we do?

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.517
<i>I mean, I don't know,
just don't get shot, bro.</i>

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.869
What do you mean,
"Don't get shot"?

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:53.145
Bobby, you supposed to be
a hardened criminal, man.

01:02:53.229 --> 01:02:54.647
That can't be your advice.

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:56.370
What the hell'd you
go to jail for, Bobby?

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:59.735
<i>I rob a Whole Foods, bro.
I rob a Whole Foods.</i>

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:03.531
That's your crime? You went to
jail for stealin' the $15 lettuce?

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:06.784
<i>No, bro, you sleepin'.
I move some coke or some dope in the day,</i>

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:10.079
<i>but my kale game, my kale game...</i>
No!

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:11.747
<i>Now, that's mink!</i>

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:14.750
<i>Grass-fed beef, you don't know
nothin' about no free-range chicken.</i>

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:15.918
Thug life.

01:03:16.002 --> 01:03:17.253
Wait, Jaylen.
Calm down, Jaylen.

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:18.897
<i>And I had all the farmer
markets smashed.</i> No! No!

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:21.507
You don't get to explain!
You don't get to explain, Bob!

01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:23.134
All right, y'all.

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:25.970
<i>Attention, intruders.
This is Principal Patowsky.</i>

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:29.640
<i>The exit doors are locked down.
There is no escape.</i>

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:33.102
I can't believe we're gonna
die over a GED practice test!

01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:34.603
It's not even a real test!
Listen.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.439
I just did this
to get out of the house.

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:37.845
I thought this was
gonna be fun.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:40.043
You know, we're gonna break in...
Just shut up! Just shut up!

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.360
Shut up!

01:03:41.444 --> 01:03:42.862
Goddamn!

01:03:42.987 --> 01:03:45.448
Been talking about your kids
and everything all day!

01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:47.158
This ain't the time.

01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:48.617
Now, y'all pull it together.

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:49.827
We are fine.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.078
We are okay.

01:03:51.162 --> 01:03:52.788
The roof. Let's hit the roof.

01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:55.309
Okay, when I went to school here,
that's how we got out of school,

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:57.585
and then we would jump onto
the elementary school roof.

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:58.668
Come on!

01:03:59.879 --> 01:04:00.880
Come here!

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:03.581
Come over here!
Come over here!

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:05.192
- This is a bad idea!
- Come on!

01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:06.385
Watch it, boy!

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:09.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.140
Oh, my God!

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:12.391
Okay. Back up.

01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:13.684
Listen to me.
Come on!

01:04:13.768 --> 01:04:15.329
Swear to you, when I
went to school here,

01:04:15.353 --> 01:04:16.771
that jump did
not seem that high.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:18.147
There's no way
I can make that.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.565
I can jump, like,
three feet!

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:22.651
My knees and my back are totally
shot from moving boxes, Teddy!

01:04:22.735 --> 01:04:24.362
All right!
What are we gonna do?

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:25.946
Listen, listen.
I got it!

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.365
Let's just say
it's 15 feet.

01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:28.616
Oh, God!

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:29.742
Take that 15 feet,

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.660
minus the three
feet that you can jump.

01:04:31.744 --> 01:04:33.079
What are you
talking about?

01:04:33.162 --> 01:04:35.331
All we gotta do is use
the Pythagorean theorem.

01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:37.875
Nobody was listening in class.
Nobody knows how to do that!

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:39.251
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:41.021
Carrie said in order to use
the Pythagorean theorem,

01:04:41.045 --> 01:04:42.588
you have to know
the hypotenuse.

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.924
All we gotta do
is hypotenuse it.

01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:46.926
A-squared plus b-squared
equals c-squared.

01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:48.386
If you know two sides,

01:04:48.469 --> 01:04:51.239
that will help you figure out the
third, so it's roughly six feet across.

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:54.225
So 15-squared is 225
divided by 6-squared.

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:55.702
Hypotenuse it!
Wait, what did I just say?

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:56.953
- It's 36.
- Yeah. 36.

01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:58.080
But you don't
divide it. You add it.

01:04:58.104 --> 01:04:59.247
But, then,
what did I just say?

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:01.191
She's the best one at math.
15-squared. Wait, no.

01:05:01.273 --> 01:05:02.542
- Hypotenuse it!
- No, no, you can do this!

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:03.567
6-squared is...

01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:04.652
I don't know.
No!

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:05.820
No. Come on, you got this.

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:08.531
Oh, my God!

01:05:09.407 --> 01:05:11.242
- Mila!
- Oh, my God!

01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:14.453
- You all right?
- Guys!

01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:15.913
It's not a hard math problem.

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:18.707
It's a simple physics problem.
Just jump.

01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:20.668
Did you
hypotenuse it?

01:05:20.835 --> 01:05:22.795
Yeah, I hypotenused it.

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:23.921
Can you just jump?

01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:25.506
Mac, you're up next.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.049
- No. No.
- Yes.

01:05:27.133 --> 01:05:28.384
Mac, don't you
give me that.

01:05:28.634 --> 01:05:30.719
Okay? When I think
"man," I think you.

01:05:30.886 --> 01:05:33.931
I think about how proud
Little Mac must be.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:36.976
I want you to do what you do
best and go be great.

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:39.311
Okay. Yeah.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.063
Get across that roof, Mac.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.231
Yeah! Okay!

01:05:42.398 --> 01:05:44.167
- All right? You got this!
- All right!

01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:45.609
Mac comin' in.
Step back.

01:05:45.693 --> 01:05:46.694
Let's go, Mac!

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:47.778
Thank you, Teddy.

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:49.613
Any time.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.990
Mac attack!

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:53.909
Mac attack!

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:07.756
Oh, God!

01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:09.133
Oh, Teddy!

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.093
Oh, why'd I listen to you?
Shit!

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.761
You were so convincing!

01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:14.180
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:06:14.346 --> 01:06:16.640
Hey! My arm's
kind of tingly.

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.476
I think I might have hurt it.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.019
Feels weird, man!

01:06:20.186 --> 01:06:22.021
His damn shoulder
is in his mouth.

01:06:28.444 --> 01:06:29.445
Oh!

01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:30.821
Hey!

01:06:30.905 --> 01:06:33.240
Big Mac, man, I'm sorry about
that. That hot chicken,

01:06:33.324 --> 01:06:35.701
it just kind of got
on rewind, man!

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:37.411
It was either the
back or the front,

01:06:37.495 --> 01:06:39.121
and I just got
these pants, fam.

01:06:39.747 --> 01:06:42.458
God, I'm having
the worst night!

01:07:00.601 --> 01:07:02.269
Hello, Teddy.

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:08.734
Hey, babe.

01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:11.070
You don't need
to "Hey, babe" me.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.242
I know what's going on.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.413
What's going on?

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.792
The late hours?

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.210
The secrecy?

01:07:27.503 --> 01:07:29.046
Just admit it, Teddy.

01:07:29.129 --> 01:07:30.548
Just admit what?

01:07:30.631 --> 01:07:31.882
It's so obvious.

01:07:33.968 --> 01:07:35.511
You're getting
cold feet.

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:43.852
Yeah!

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.605
Cold feet?

01:07:46.855 --> 01:07:49.316
Ever since you proposed,
you haven't been yourself.

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:50.985
Cold feet?

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:55.072
Lisa, I am not
getting cold feet.

01:07:56.031 --> 01:07:58.367
In fact, it's the
complete opposite.

01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.868
My feet are very warm.

01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:01.829
I want this.

01:08:01.996 --> 01:08:02.997
And I apologize.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.666
I apologize if things have been
a little crazy as of late.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:07.001
But, babe,

01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:09.044
you gotta know
that I am out here.

01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.963
I'm trying.

01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:13.549
Okay? I am
busting my ass

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:15.593
every day, every night,

01:08:15.676 --> 01:08:16.926
for us.

01:08:17.428 --> 01:08:18.845
For me and you.

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:20.805
I'm in a different world
out there, babe,

01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:23.475
and this world is
stressing me out.

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:27.354
It is stressing me out.

01:08:28.981 --> 01:08:30.649
I'm sorry I doubted you.

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:32.818
I know this career
change has been a lot.

01:08:33.027 --> 01:08:34.653
It's a lot.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.072
It's so much.

01:08:37.406 --> 01:08:39.825
It's so, so much.

01:08:40.451 --> 01:08:41.827
Poor baby.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.207
I love you.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.631
I love you, too.

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:59.053
<i>Does that
complete your order?</i>

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:00.738
<i>Wait. Hold up.
I don't want that apple pie.</i>

01:09:00.763 --> 01:09:03.723
I'm sorry, it's kind of hard to hear you.
There's a baby in the background.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:04.926
<i>Hush. Baby, I said be quiet.</i>

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:06.243
<i>Sit down.</i>
Yeah, say it one more time for me.

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:07.908
Say it again?
<i>Is that burger good or what?</i>

01:09:08.062 --> 01:09:10.314
Any way I can get you to
respectfully shut that baby up?

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:11.689
<i>What'd you say? Heck no!</i>

01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:13.484
Just pull up to the window,
for the love...

01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:15.778
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:17.946
It won't work.
I see you, Teddy.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.198
It's not working.

01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:22.408
Teddy Walker,
behind the soda machine.

01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:23.661
<i>Hello?</i>
Shit!

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:24.745
Teddy Walker!

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:25.996
I see you looking at...

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.706
We're making eye
contact right now.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:28.916
Open your eyes, Teddy.

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:30.250
Teddy, come here!

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:31.335
Stewart!

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:32.544
Hey.

01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:33.772
Stewart, you were
sayin' "Teddy"?

01:09:33.796 --> 01:09:34.921
About 10 times.

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:36.215
Hey!
Hey.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:37.841
Do me a favor.
Yeah?

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.426
Go over there and handle that
situation at the drive-through.

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:43.033
And I'll tell you what to do after
that because I'm in charge.

01:09:43.639 --> 01:09:44.973
Hey, so, give me a second.
<i>Hello?</i>

01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:46.058
Ma'am.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.661
<i>I said I don't want the pie.</i>
Okay. Ma'am.

01:09:47.685 --> 01:09:48.685
She don't want the pie.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:49.895
Take the pie off.

01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:52.356
<i>I said I ain't gettin' the pie.</i>
Pull up!

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:53.839
<i>You heard me?</i>
Pull up to the window!

01:09:53.941 --> 01:09:55.567
<i>All right.</i>
When she pull up,

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:57.854
tell me, 'cause I'mma come
punch the baby in the face.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.155
God don't see everything.
Just let me know.

01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:02.741
Hey, talk to me, man.
How you doing?

01:10:03.826 --> 01:10:05.703
You know, I thought
it was the Woodbridge punks

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:07.180
that broke into
the school, but now,

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.414
it all makes sense.

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:11.417
I found this

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:13.043
at the scene
of the crime.

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:17.297
So what'd you do?
Break into my computer?

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:18.882
Steal the midterm?

01:10:18.966 --> 01:10:21.218
Being a little paranoid,
aren't we, Stew? Am I?

01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:23.488
Stewart, that's a plastic bag
with a chicken wrapper in it

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:24.989
with the word
"evidence" written on it,

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:26.640
which is probably
in your handwriting.

01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:29.852
It's not exactly a smoking gun,
Stew.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:31.687
It's just
a coincidence, right?

01:10:31.854 --> 01:10:32.855
Probably.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:35.107
If you stole that test,

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.692
I will find out, Teddy.

01:10:36.775 --> 01:10:39.653
I'm an honest man trying
to make an honest living.

01:10:39.737 --> 01:10:42.197
Teddy Walker does not cheat.

01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:43.949
You cheated.

01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:48.495
Every last one of you cheated.

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:51.498
Uh... Whoa.

01:10:51.707 --> 01:10:54.001
Carrie, those are very
strong accusations.

01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:56.211
For real. Like, what?

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:57.463
I'm offended.

01:10:57.755 --> 01:10:59.757
Well, I'll take
note of that, Teddy.

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:01.675
Which one of you
wanna own up to it?

01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:03.427
I'm offended, too.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:06.221
Bobby. You a criminal.

01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:08.385
You obviously not good at it.
That's why you in jail.

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:10.267
Did you orchestrate
this whole thing?

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.312
<i>I mean, why you gonna pick
on me and profile me?</i>

01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:15.355
<i>I'm the only one
locked up here.</i>

01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:17.441
<i>So if I'm locked up in here,</i>

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:20.277
<i>how can I be out there
stealing the test, Miss Carrie?</i>

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.612
Wait a minute!

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:22.863
Y'all stole the test?

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.782
I'm not sayin' nothin'.
I don't know nothin'.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.325
I don't know shit.

01:11:26.492 --> 01:11:29.161
'Cause I never said nothin' about
anybody stealing the test.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.497
I'm about to get to the truth.

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:33.457
Who stole the test?

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:35.334
Mac,

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:38.712
you wanna explain to me
how you got a perfect score?

01:11:38.796 --> 01:11:40.047
Here's the thing.
All right?

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.966
I know I didn't get
a perfect score.

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:44.384
Because I missed
a few on purpose.

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:45.552
Fudge!

01:11:47.763 --> 01:11:49.097
Thank you!

01:11:49.181 --> 01:11:50.516
<i>You's a snitch, Mac!</i>

01:11:50.599 --> 01:11:52.142
Snitches are bitches.

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.353
I don't like cheaters.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.524
And I hate that I am teaching
a room full of cheaters!

01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:00.859
I don't like men that cheat.

01:12:00.943 --> 01:12:02.528
I don't like women that cheat.

01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:03.880
I don't even
deal with politicians.

01:12:03.904 --> 01:12:05.781
You know why?
'Cause they all cheaters.

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:07.282
I don't even eat Cheetos.

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:09.284
You know why?
'Cause it sound like "cheaters."

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:11.829
Plus that Cheeto dust'll
give you that Trump color.

01:12:12.079 --> 01:12:13.080
Yeah.

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:15.749
It's hard to get that Cheeto
dust off your hands.

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:17.459
It'll mess up your jabos.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.336
You know,
I liked you at first.

01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:22.605
I'm done with all of y'all.
All of y'all can get up out my class.

01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:23.966
I'm done with y'all.
What?

01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:25.693
Okay, Carrie, let me...
I wanna say something.

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:27.946
If I don't get my GED, he's
gonna drop out of high school.

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:30.180
If I don't get my GED,
I'm going to prison.

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:31.515
<i>I need this GED!</i>

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:34.285
You need to keep your booty closed.
That's what you need to do. You in jail.

01:12:34.309 --> 01:12:35.727
No, I need this GED.

01:12:35.811 --> 01:12:37.312
We can't live
on Randy's salary.

01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:39.523
Please don't make me go home.
I hate my kids.

01:12:41.108 --> 01:12:42.568
But I love being a mom.

01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:45.237
I'm blessed. So blessed.

01:12:45.654 --> 01:12:46.947
Carrie, please.

01:12:47.114 --> 01:12:50.492
I cannot live a lifetime of driving
around drunks in a Corolla.

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:52.178
Look, the last thing
I wanna do

01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:53.996
is be cleaning the rooms
at the Best Western.

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:55.122
Okay? 'Cause all that...

01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:56.485
Especially them
short stay rooms.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.940
'Cause you know what that is,
right?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.376
That's just gonna
be used condoms.

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:00.460
Soiled sheets.

01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:02.344
Ain't that where you met
your bottom bitch at?

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:06.216
You know Trina?

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:07.718
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:09.303
She got a fat ass, too.

01:13:10.012 --> 01:13:12.431
You know what? All of you got
little sob stories

01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:14.099
but y'all should've thought
about that

01:13:14.182 --> 01:13:15.767
before you went
and stole the test.

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:19.855
Just get the hell
up out my class.

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.444
It's not a sob story.

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:27.380
No! I'm the one who wants
to get my life together.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:29.114
Let me tell you
something about Jay.

01:13:29.197 --> 01:13:30.490
Get out!

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:33.327
Get out!

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.536
Get out of my...

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:35.787
It was me.

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:38.665
It was me.

01:13:41.585 --> 01:13:43.025
You shouldn't be
mad at none of them.

01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:44.814
I mean, yeah,
they looked at the answers,

01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:47.158
but they wouldn't have if I
hadn't had put it on their lap.

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:51.053
I take responsibility for it
all. I was the mastermind.

01:13:51.136 --> 01:13:53.221
I orchestrated the whole thing.
It was all me.

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:55.807
Thank you.

01:13:55.891 --> 01:13:57.309
Thank you, Teddy.

01:13:57.809 --> 01:13:59.645
I appreciate your honesty.

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:01.563
I'm just trying to do
what's right, Carrie.

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.774
Now you can get
the hell out my class.

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:05.692
Huh?

01:14:05.776 --> 01:14:07.235
Hit the road, Jack.

01:14:07.319 --> 01:14:10.697
Don't let the doorknob hit you
where the good Lord split you.

01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:13.593
I thought that when I said all that
stuff that you would listen to it.

01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:16.411
No, no, no. You gets no
second chances up in here.

01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:17.579
Not with me no more.

01:14:17.663 --> 01:14:19.122
Uh-uh. I ain't got your
back no more.

01:14:19.206 --> 01:14:21.059
You don't even wanna be here!
I do wanna be here.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:22.918
You don't even wanna
be here, Teddy!

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:24.002
No.

01:14:24.086 --> 01:14:25.212
And as for the
rest of you?

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:29.091
I want you to think long and hard
about if you really want this.

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:32.928
Class dismissed.

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:37.474
"Find a solution
for the..."

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:39.810
I don't know none of this shit.
I need you.

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:41.533
I need your help.
Put your damn hand down!

01:14:42.771 --> 01:14:44.940
I'm going to Rainbows
before they close.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.150
That's emotional
shopping, Carrie.

01:14:47.234 --> 01:14:48.860
It's Rainbows,
you blessed heifer.

01:14:48.944 --> 01:14:50.362
Shit is cheap.

01:14:55.075 --> 01:14:56.910
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

01:14:57.619 --> 01:14:59.538
You are stupid.

01:15:00.747 --> 01:15:02.947
She didn't know what was going
on until you admitted it.

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.543
We had her
right up till the end,

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:05.961
and then Teddy,

01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:07.170
old brick head...

01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:09.923
Ow, Teddy!

01:15:10.007 --> 01:15:11.049
You deserved that.

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:13.468
<i>A school.</i>

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:16.555
We've never taken on
a project like that.

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:19.599
Well, I am an
outside-of-the-box thinker.

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:21.101
That's just who I am.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.021
I think that if students are
excited about their environment,

01:15:24.104 --> 01:15:25.731
they'll be excited
about learning.

01:15:25.981 --> 01:15:28.442
That makes total sense.
I know I would.

01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:29.943
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

01:15:30.027 --> 01:15:32.571
If you're interested, I'd love to
give you a tour of the school.

01:15:32.654 --> 01:15:33.864
You could come
by any day,

01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:35.949
or, you know, you could even
come after school.

01:15:36.033 --> 01:15:38.452
We have several night
programs as well.

01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:41.872
Hey.
Hey.

01:15:43.874 --> 01:15:47.002
Okay, show me what you got.
Show me what you got.

01:15:47.169 --> 01:15:49.004
What you got for me? Come on.

01:15:50.005 --> 01:15:51.006
What you got?

01:15:52.049 --> 01:15:53.508
You killin' me!
You won!

01:15:53.675 --> 01:15:54.760
Congratulations.

01:15:54.843 --> 01:15:56.344
I'm proud of you, boo.

01:15:56.428 --> 01:15:59.514
Now, it's not cool that you beat
your teacher at Texas hold 'em

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:02.809
but I like the way you nailed down
the calculations on the pot odds.

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:05.145
So I'mma let this slide.

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:06.813
Now, remember
what I said.

01:16:07.064 --> 01:16:08.231
There are no shortcuts.

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:09.900
You gotta work
your butt off.

01:16:10.067 --> 01:16:11.943
Okay? Give me
some love.

01:16:13.278 --> 01:16:14.529
I'm so proud of you.

01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:15.989
Go on and have
a good day now.

01:16:16.073 --> 01:16:18.200
Maybe one day
I'll take you to Vegas.

01:16:25.373 --> 01:16:26.541
That was cool.

01:16:28.335 --> 01:16:29.836
You know...

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.148
This used to be the Special Ed
classroom when I went here.

01:16:32.172 --> 01:16:33.632
It still is.

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:35.509
You teach Special Ed?

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:38.762
Special Ed is one
of my sections.

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:41.515
It's one of my
favorites, actually.

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:47.479
You know, that kid reminds
me a lot of myself.

01:16:48.063 --> 01:16:50.190
I couldn't do math for shit
when I was in school.

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:52.919
Difference is I didn't have
a teacher like you

01:16:52.943 --> 01:16:54.545
that was willing to
stay behind to help me.

01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:56.363
I know what
you're doin', Teddy.

01:16:56.446 --> 01:16:57.531
And I admit,

01:16:57.614 --> 01:17:00.951
it was very cool of you to take
the fall for your classmates.

01:17:02.244 --> 01:17:03.495
But you're a hustler.

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:06.248
Tryin' to skate by
without doing the work.

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:07.916
You should know
you can't hustle me.

01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:09.292
I do.

01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:11.670
Okay? I do know that.

01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:13.588
And I promise you, I'm done.

01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:15.340
I'm not hustling no more.

01:17:15.757 --> 01:17:18.301
Night school is about
second chances.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.429
And if I don't get this second chance,
then it's over for me.

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:23.974
Night school
is all that I have.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.894
Please.

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:30.480
I'll consider it
on one condition.

01:17:30.939 --> 01:17:32.149
Whatever it is.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:33.984
We get you tested.

01:17:34.568 --> 01:17:36.528
For STDs?
That's not an issue.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:39.114
I don't mind that.
I mean...

01:17:39.197 --> 01:17:40.490
God damn it.

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:44.119
There was one time where the condom popped
'cause I put my balls inside the...

01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:46.329
No, you idiot.

01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:48.373
For learning disabilities.

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:53.044
Nobody cares about your
escapades with your bitches.

01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:56.506
So what are
the test results, Carrie?

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.925
Teddy, the issue is...

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.345
You're clinically dumb.

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:06.933
I knew it.

01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:10.437
I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it was a mistake.

01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:12.772
Boy, I'm sorry.
I'm just messin' with you.

01:18:12.856 --> 01:18:14.608
Come on, Carrie.
Look, look.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:18.111
My suspicions were right, and you,
my friend, are dyslexic.

01:18:18.987 --> 01:18:20.030
Okay.

01:18:20.447 --> 01:18:22.490
Okay, so that just means
I'm having problems

01:18:22.574 --> 01:18:23.843
with my reading and my writing,
right?

01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:26.578
Yep. But you also have
dyscalculia.

01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:28.741
Dyscalculia? I don't even
know how to pronounce that.

01:18:28.955 --> 01:18:31.833
Basically, it's like dyslexia,
but with math.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.378
That's what I got.

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:38.465
I knew it! Now that you say it,
it makes sense.

01:18:38.715 --> 01:18:40.818
If you take me to a restaurant and
you say, "Teddy, leave the tip,"

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.344
I'm all over the place.

01:18:42.427 --> 01:18:44.054
That's exactly what it is.
We did it!

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:45.263
We're not done.

01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:47.724
You also have
a processing disorder.

01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:50.060
I got a touch
of prostate cancer?

01:18:50.143 --> 01:18:51.519
She didn't touch
my ass one time.

01:18:51.603 --> 01:18:54.230
I said
"processing disorder."

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.483
Carrie, if you're not
gonna help me,

01:18:56.566 --> 01:18:57.859
then we're wasting our time.

01:18:57.943 --> 01:18:59.945
Explain to me
what this stuff is.

01:19:00.028 --> 01:19:02.614
If I got a processing...
Oh, my God.

01:19:04.658 --> 01:19:05.992
I'm not processing it.

01:19:07.953 --> 01:19:09.788
I didn't process
none of that shit.

01:19:09.871 --> 01:19:14.626
You are just one big, beautiful mixed
drink of learning disabilities.

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:16.044
So I'm not dumb?

01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:18.171
Boy, I was just playin'
when I said that earlier.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:21.007
No good teacher would ever
call their students dumb.

01:19:21.091 --> 01:19:22.509
Okay.

01:19:22.926 --> 01:19:24.636
So how do we fix it?
Let's talk solution.

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:26.388
Well, there's no cure
for what you have.

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:28.056
Oh, my God!

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.809
I got learning herpes?

01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:31.935
Boy!

01:19:32.018 --> 01:19:33.353
Oh, shit!

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.939
There is no such thing
as learning herpes.

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:37.315
I'm blistering up.

01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:39.401
It's 'cause
I'm tryin' to think.

01:19:39.484 --> 01:19:41.194
Hey, Teddy!

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.445
Big Mac.

01:19:43.321 --> 01:19:44.590
- Ringleader.
- Oh, my gosh!

01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:45.699
Teddy, you're here!

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:47.575
<i>Hey, Teddy!
What's up, man?</i>

01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:49.369
Teaching the
conventional way

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:51.454
just isn't gonna
get it done for Teddy.

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:53.206
So we're gonna mix it up.

01:19:53.915 --> 01:19:55.208
They out here
getting it in.

01:19:56.126 --> 01:19:57.520
What's going on, Carrie?
Why you in here?

01:19:57.544 --> 01:19:59.379
Why you in the ring?
What's going on?

01:19:59.504 --> 01:20:02.590
Teddy, your difficulties are focus-related.
Uh-huh.

01:20:02.674 --> 01:20:05.051
My goal is to remove
that mind chatter

01:20:05.135 --> 01:20:08.263
so you can achieve properly
unencumbered neural pathways.

01:20:08.346 --> 01:20:09.848
And this isn't a ring.

01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:11.182
It's a hexagon.

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.019
Oh, it is. Yeah.

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:15.746
Why are you taking
your shoes off?

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:16.813
Is this somebody's carpet?

01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:19.149
Teddy, what's the square
root of 81?

01:20:19.733 --> 01:20:20.817
What?

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.943
Ow!

01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:24.571
Shit!

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:25.864
What's the square
root of 81?

01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:26.990
I don't know!

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:28.158
What you doing?

01:20:28.867 --> 01:20:30.177
Carrie!
What's the square root of 81?

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:31.286
You breaking my arm!

01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:32.847
Come on, we're clearing
those neural pathways.

01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:33.913
No!
Stop it!

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:35.248
Hey! What you doing?

01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:36.958
Focus!

01:20:37.042 --> 01:20:38.918
Square root! Focus!

01:20:39.085 --> 01:20:41.337
I don't know! Oh, God!

01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.717
Concentrate. Teddy,
concentrate.

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:47.343
Come on, Teddy. Come on.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.683
How you feelin' today, Teddy?

01:20:53.767 --> 01:20:56.186
I'm feeling
fine, Carrie,

01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:59.147
but I ain't feelin' this
Mr. Miyagi shit. Okay?

01:20:59.314 --> 01:21:00.690
What's the capital of Belgium?

01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:02.192
Uh...

01:21:02.609 --> 01:21:03.610
Waffles?

01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:04.986
What?
Run!

01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:07.238
Don't you run from me!

01:21:07.322 --> 01:21:08.364
Don't! He's so little!

01:21:09.074 --> 01:21:11.201
Jesus! What is the
capital of Belgium?

01:21:11.284 --> 01:21:13.161
I haven't eaten
breakfast. I don't know!

01:21:13.244 --> 01:21:15.038
That is not the answer!

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:17.123
Pretend you're dead!

01:21:17.707 --> 01:21:19.209
Get back here!

01:21:20.043 --> 01:21:22.462
Teddy, focus. Concentrate.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:23.713
<i>Let's do it!</i>

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.718
Water is comprised of?

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:30.242
Let's go, Teddy.
You got this, Teddy.

01:21:31.012 --> 01:21:32.180
Rain.
Rain.

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:33.973
Wait, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

01:21:34.516 --> 01:21:36.226
I know it! I know it!

01:21:36.309 --> 01:21:37.644
Think.

01:21:37.727 --> 01:21:38.978
Focus!

01:21:39.062 --> 01:21:40.105
Helium.

01:21:40.188 --> 01:21:41.981
No, no, no.
Nitrogen.

01:21:42.065 --> 01:21:43.399
It's nitrogen. Right?

01:21:43.483 --> 01:21:45.235
You better get it right.
It's a gas!

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:46.736
What?
It's a gas!

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:52.951
Jesus Christ!

01:21:53.034 --> 01:21:54.536
Give me the answer!
Say it!

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:57.330
Give me the damn answer.
Tell me!

01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:58.748
It's two part hydrogen...

01:22:00.667 --> 01:22:01.960
One part oxygen!

01:22:02.043 --> 01:22:03.086
Yes!

01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:04.170
Say that again!

01:22:04.254 --> 01:22:05.523
He said it. Don't make
him say it again.

01:22:05.547 --> 01:22:08.967
I said two part hydrogen,
one part oxygen.

01:22:09.801 --> 01:22:10.885
Teddy, that's right.

01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:12.095
You got it right.
What?

01:22:12.178 --> 01:22:13.429
That's the correct answer.

01:22:14.305 --> 01:22:15.348
I got it right!

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:16.516
You got it right, Teddy!

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:17.976
Yes! Yes!

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.561
Yes!

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:21.396
What a big day
for all of us.

01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:23.398
I can't believe
that I actually...

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:25.608
What?

01:22:26.067 --> 01:22:27.861
What is that smell?
What is that?

01:22:28.153 --> 01:22:30.697
Oh. Now that's a gas.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.032
You bust ass
in my face, Carrie?

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:34.450
Methane.

01:22:34.534 --> 01:22:37.745
It's in my mouth! You got my
lips all chapped and shit!

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:40.790
This ain't no type of education.
This is chemical warfare.

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:45.211
AirDrop it to you.

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.546
Yeah.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:51.551
Let me see it.

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:52.927
Theresa,
what's wrong?

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:54.345
Oh!

01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:57.765
This all went so fast.
I don't want school to end.

01:22:58.349 --> 01:23:01.144
Okay. Well, you can come
to college with me.

01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:03.521
What? You're going?

01:23:03.605 --> 01:23:05.440
I'm so happy for you.

01:23:05.607 --> 01:23:07.025
When did you decide?

01:23:07.108 --> 01:23:08.568
Don't take this
the wrong way

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:10.987
but hanging out with you guys
scared the shit out of me.

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:14.365
So I think I'm gonna do
something with my life.

01:23:14.574 --> 01:23:15.867
That's wonderful.

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:18.703
I can just see you now,
in the cutest outfit,

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:20.622
little miniskirt,
walking through the quad.

01:23:20.705 --> 01:23:22.749
You're clutching onto
your philosophy thesis,

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:23.872
but when you get to class,

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:25.436
the professor is blown away
by how brilliant it is.

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.461
Yeah.

01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:29.422
So he grabs onto you, and you can
feel him up against your thigh.

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:33.051
Not in a sexual way, but not
not in a sexual way, you know?

01:23:33.134 --> 01:23:35.345
And he looks strangely
like Bruno Mars.

01:23:35.428 --> 01:23:38.264
Even though he's super academic,
he wears pink blazers sometimes.

01:23:38.348 --> 01:23:40.016
Well, you can
still go to college

01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:42.352
and do that other stuff.

01:23:43.645 --> 01:23:44.896
Me? College?

01:23:44.979 --> 01:23:46.189
Oh, no.
Randy wouldn't let me.

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:47.690
Screw Randy.

01:23:47.774 --> 01:23:49.054
You can do whatever
you wanna do.

01:23:49.108 --> 01:23:50.235
You don't know Randy.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:53.112
Why can't you just be,
like, "Hey, Randy, I wanna do this.

01:23:53.196 --> 01:23:54.197
"Deal with it."

01:23:54.364 --> 01:23:55.698
Okay!

01:23:55.865 --> 01:23:57.825
Night school people!

01:23:57.992 --> 01:23:59.369
Last class,

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:01.329
final demonstration.

01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:02.455
Carrie, please.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.666
No more learning.
My brain is at capacity.

01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:08.086
I want to be a dental hygienist,
not Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking.

01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:10.838
Well, okay, Luis.
I'm right there with you.

01:24:11.798 --> 01:24:13.216
Oh, no!

01:24:13.299 --> 01:24:14.842
Is this another science
experiment?

01:24:14.926 --> 01:24:18.346
Oh, no. This is a celebration,
Big Mac!

01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:20.598
Oh, yeah. You guys been
working your asses...

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:21.891
Oh, shit!

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:23.893
Hey!
Shit.

01:24:24.269 --> 01:24:25.603
I'm so sorry, Bobby.

01:24:25.687 --> 01:24:26.729
<i>Nah, that's cool.</i>

01:24:26.813 --> 01:24:29.274
<i>I'mma make me some toilet
punch after lockdown, baby.</i>

01:24:29.524 --> 01:24:31.460
Y'all hear that music?

01:24:31.484 --> 01:24:32.610
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah!

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:34.696
Oh. You know what?
It's prom night.

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:35.905
You guys go to prom?

01:24:36.364 --> 01:24:37.532
No, I was in juvie.

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:39.325
Really?
I was home with an infant.

01:24:39.409 --> 01:24:40.952
This is a sign, guys.

01:24:41.202 --> 01:24:43.162
What? Yeah, we've
been working hard.

01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:46.040
We should let some steam off.
Why don't we go to the prom?

01:24:46.207 --> 01:24:48.084
You know what?
Class dismissed.

01:24:48.251 --> 01:24:49.585
Let's go shake that ass!

01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:54.007
<i>Let's go to prom, baby.
Let's go to prom!</i>

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.928
Oh, my God!
You need to get drunk!

01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:00.096
What the hell, Theresa?

01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:03.224
I've been outside
honking for 15 minutes.

01:25:14.235 --> 01:25:15.695
Don't talk to me
like that.

01:25:17.155 --> 01:25:18.948
I'm your wife.
I'm not your mommy,

01:25:19.032 --> 01:25:20.241
and I'm not your
house cleaner.

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.703
And when I get my GED,
I'm gonna pursue my dreams

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.163
and I'm gonna
need your support.

01:25:25.246 --> 01:25:27.999
And also I wanna have sex
on a regular basis.

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:29.292
Mmm...

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:30.710
I mean, like,
really weird sex.

01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:33.713
Like, not "make a baby" sex,
but "45 minutes" sex.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:35.840
Like, <i>Fifty Shades
of Grey</i> sex.

01:25:35.923 --> 01:25:38.176
I want you to crack
this up like a walnut.

01:25:38.343 --> 01:25:39.719
Do I make myself clear?

01:25:39.802 --> 01:25:41.220
Okay! Okay!

01:25:41.304 --> 01:25:42.889
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:25:43.056 --> 01:25:44.932
I think you're
a freakin' rock star.

01:25:45.475 --> 01:25:47.477
And judging by what
you just said to me,

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.145
I can't wait to
be your porn star.

01:25:49.854 --> 01:25:51.064
Whoa.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.443
All right, y'all.
We got the party up in here tonight!

01:25:57.195 --> 01:26:00.365
It's a clean batch.
I want this punch to stay that way.

01:26:00.782 --> 01:26:03.076
I'm gonna be checking
throughout the night.

01:26:03.868 --> 01:26:05.244
No, no, no.

01:26:05.328 --> 01:26:07.872
Excuse me. This dance
is for students only.

01:26:07.955 --> 01:26:11.292
Well, this is my night school
class, and they are students here.

01:26:11.376 --> 01:26:13.503
Okay, well, technically,
you're still on school hours,

01:26:13.586 --> 01:26:15.506
so, Miss Carter, please
return to your classroom.

01:26:15.546 --> 01:26:17.965
Well, we gonna spend our
class hours in the gym.

01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:19.217
Carrie...
At the party.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.445
So get out the way, bitch. Move!
I can't allow this, Carrie!

01:26:21.469 --> 01:26:24.097
She got you. She got you. Why you
always 'bout that rah-rah, man?

01:26:24.222 --> 01:26:26.766
I'll allow this to happen.
We just tryin' to get a vibe, though.

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:31.938
All right, Piedmont High,
make room for the night school crew!

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:34.732
Yeah!

01:26:35.066 --> 01:26:36.692
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:39.862
Everybody, come on.

01:26:43.825 --> 01:26:44.968
All right, all right.

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:46.536
Miss C gonna kill 'em.

01:26:48.913 --> 01:26:49.914
Come on!

01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:52.959
Yeah!

01:27:17.692 --> 01:27:18.693
God!

01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:20.236
Get it!

01:27:23.239 --> 01:27:24.699
What you doin'?

01:27:27.618 --> 01:27:28.619
Okay!

01:27:28.703 --> 01:27:30.121
Go, Theresa!

01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:39.714
That's my woman!

01:27:40.173 --> 01:27:41.841
That's not for
kids, Theresa!

01:27:42.341 --> 01:27:43.384
Go, T!

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:56.981
<i>Hey, hey</i>

01:27:58.733 --> 01:28:01.861
<i>The dream is
all that keeps me alive</i>

01:28:05.156 --> 01:28:09.368
<i>No matter what it takes You know
I'm always gonna keep fighting</i>

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.037
<i>I'm fighting</i>

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:15.208
<i>I'm never gonna
let the dream go</i>

01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:18.294
<i>Take this all the way</i>

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:22.465
<i>Nobody's ever, ever gonna
stop el sueño</i>

01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:27.887
<i>No desert, no snake gonna
take me down</i>

01:28:28.054 --> 01:28:30.723
<i>Take me down, no way</i>

01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:33.392
Wait, sweetheart,
who's watching the kids?

01:28:33.476 --> 01:28:34.936
I got it covered.

01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:38.231
<i>She said, "I wanna be
a flight attendant."</i>

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:39.440
<i>You see?</i>

01:28:40.441 --> 01:28:42.601
<i>"I wanna go from place to place.
It'd be like going..."</i>

01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:47.365
<i>Is y'all little bitches
listening?</i>

01:28:50.117 --> 01:28:52.119
You know, Carrie,
you are incredible.

01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.955
I'm serious.

01:28:54.121 --> 01:28:56.841
There's never been a teacher that
believed in me the way that you do.

01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:58.626
Teddy, what can I say?

01:28:58.793 --> 01:29:01.963
You've grown so much in such
a short period of time.

01:29:02.129 --> 01:29:04.924
And if you keep up with all the
stuff that we've been doing,

01:29:05.091 --> 01:29:06.801
you are well on your way.

01:29:07.802 --> 01:29:09.178
I'm just...

01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:11.389
I'm really,
really proud of you.

01:29:18.104 --> 01:29:19.522
You know, Carrie,

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:23.025
these past few weeks
have been amazing.

01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:27.446
I mean, our chemistry,
it goes without saying, it's strong.

01:29:27.613 --> 01:29:29.532
I sense it.
I know you do, too.

01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:32.577
But as magical as these moments
that we've been having may be...

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:33.995
Fool, I'm gay.

01:29:34.078 --> 01:29:35.538
I'm not tryin' to play.

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:37.061
Now, I'm not sayin'
I ain't no freak.

01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:38.291
'Cause I'd drop it
off on you.

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:39.584
I'm a lesbian.

01:29:39.667 --> 01:29:42.461
If you wanna pursue acting,
you can.

01:29:42.545 --> 01:29:43.796
No, I'm gay.

01:29:43.879 --> 01:29:45.482
Say that again. It sound like
you said you're gay.

01:29:45.506 --> 01:29:46.757
I'm gay.

01:29:46.841 --> 01:29:48.467
I like women.

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:50.595
Are you sure?

01:29:50.678 --> 01:29:51.905
Because I'm getting
a whole different vibe.

01:29:51.929 --> 01:29:53.289
Oh, hell no!
I'm pretty sure.

01:29:53.389 --> 01:29:54.599
Oh, God.

01:29:57.018 --> 01:29:58.102
Teddy?

01:29:58.644 --> 01:30:01.272
Is the one on the left
your type?

01:30:01.355 --> 01:30:03.816
Uh-uh. The one in the tight dress is.
Shit, that's mine.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:06.944
Hey!

01:30:07.111 --> 01:30:08.237
There they go.

01:30:08.738 --> 01:30:10.281
What are you doin' here?

01:30:11.032 --> 01:30:12.074
Huh?

01:30:12.158 --> 01:30:14.035
What are you doing
at a high school prom?

01:30:15.453 --> 01:30:16.954
What are you
doin' here, babe?

01:30:17.038 --> 01:30:18.122
Why you here?

01:30:19.206 --> 01:30:22.209
Principal Patowsky is interested
in us redesigning the school

01:30:22.376 --> 01:30:24.136
so he asked us to stop by...
Oh, he did, huh?

01:30:24.295 --> 01:30:25.338
Yeah.

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:27.173
Well played, Stewart.

01:30:27.882 --> 01:30:29.342
You two know each other?

01:30:30.051 --> 01:30:31.260
Ask Stewart.

01:30:31.719 --> 01:30:33.346
Yes, we went to
high school together.

01:30:33.512 --> 01:30:35.514
I think I mentioned that
at our first meeting.

01:30:35.681 --> 01:30:36.682
No.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.768
No, you didn't.

01:30:40.311 --> 01:30:42.104
Teddy, I am so confused.

01:30:42.188 --> 01:30:43.564
Why are you here?

01:30:43.648 --> 01:30:44.815
And who is she?

01:30:44.899 --> 01:30:46.651
I can explain.
It ain't what it look like.

01:30:46.734 --> 01:30:48.569
I'm in here with
a bunch of kids,

01:30:48.653 --> 01:30:50.112
dressed in street clothes,

01:30:50.279 --> 01:30:51.999
then remember I blew out
the barbecue shack.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.909
Fire took me out
of that thing.

01:30:55.284 --> 01:30:57.578
And now my
windshield was...

01:30:57.745 --> 01:30:59.372
What's got me messed
up about the car...

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:00.998
My brakes ain't workin'

01:31:01.165 --> 01:31:02.792
'cause I backed
into this...

01:31:02.875 --> 01:31:04.043
She gay!

01:31:05.127 --> 01:31:06.754
She ain't even
interested in me.

01:31:07.213 --> 01:31:08.214
So...

01:31:09.507 --> 01:31:11.217
God damn it. Lisa.

01:31:11.384 --> 01:31:12.551
Not now. Not now.
Wait.

01:31:12.635 --> 01:31:13.719
Lisa!

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.807
Okay, Lisa. Lisa, Lisa.

01:31:18.182 --> 01:31:19.850
Lisa, can you
listen, please?

01:31:19.934 --> 01:31:22.061
Lisa, please, just listen!
What?

01:31:22.478 --> 01:31:23.854
What are you
gonna say, Teddy?

01:31:26.065 --> 01:31:27.858
I'm a high school dropout.

01:31:28.609 --> 01:31:30.653
Okay? That woman in there,
Carrie,

01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:32.446
that's my night
school teacher.

01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:34.257
That's what I've been doin'
all these evenings.

01:31:34.281 --> 01:31:36.075
I've been studying to get my GED

01:31:36.242 --> 01:31:38.119
so that I can get
a job at Marvin's.

01:31:39.078 --> 01:31:40.746
So you don't work there now?

01:31:42.707 --> 01:31:44.250
I don't work there yet.

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:48.754
Right now, I work at a fast food
restaurant called Christian Chicken

01:31:48.838 --> 01:31:50.923
where the chicken is Christian
for some reason.

01:31:51.090 --> 01:31:54.719
Wait, Lisa, let me just say
this before you judge him.

01:31:54.802 --> 01:31:56.220
It ain't that
average chicken.

01:31:56.345 --> 01:31:57.596
It's not the
same fast food

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.825
that you be gettin' from these
other little hood spots.

01:31:59.849 --> 01:32:02.184
It's got the flavor. I don't
know if they use a needle,

01:32:02.268 --> 01:32:04.148
but they get the flavor in deep.
Jaylen, Jaylen!

01:32:04.937 --> 01:32:06.272
How do you know my name?

01:32:06.355 --> 01:32:08.333
My nigga be talking about you
in the class all the time.

01:32:08.357 --> 01:32:10.568
He said you was bad. I didn't
know you was that bad.

01:32:10.651 --> 01:32:11.861
We're Teddy's
classmates.

01:32:11.944 --> 01:32:13.946
I'm Theresa.
That's Jaylen, Mila,

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:15.573
Mackenzie, and Luis.
Hey.

01:32:16.157 --> 01:32:17.241
You remember me?

01:32:17.324 --> 01:32:20.035
I was actually the waiter
at the restaurant

01:32:20.119 --> 01:32:22.121
when Teddy pulled
all of his pubes

01:32:22.204 --> 01:32:24.623
and he put 'em in the cheesecake
to get out of paying.

01:32:25.124 --> 01:32:26.917
Now, we're best friends.

01:32:29.462 --> 01:32:31.297
Thank you for your honesty.

01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:34.341
Honesty.

01:32:34.967 --> 01:32:36.343
I know

01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:39.346
that this is
a lot to take in.

01:32:39.513 --> 01:32:40.514
Really?

01:32:40.931 --> 01:32:42.767
But if you let me explain...
No.

01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:44.518
If you let me explain...
No, Teddy.

01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:45.895
I'm done with
your explanations.

01:32:47.646 --> 01:32:49.356
You lied to me
about everything.

01:32:50.649 --> 01:32:51.776
Why?

01:32:52.401 --> 01:32:53.611
To impress me?

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:55.780
Teddy, I make my own money.

01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:57.924
You think I care about
what kind of car you drive

01:32:57.948 --> 01:32:59.492
or what kind of watch
you have on?

01:33:00.743 --> 01:33:02.036
That's not me.

01:33:02.828 --> 01:33:04.955
If you think that,
then you don't know me.

01:33:05.122 --> 01:33:06.290
That's not true.

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.660
If you don't know me, then
you couldn't truly love me.

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:10.211
That's not true, Lisa.

01:33:13.422 --> 01:33:15.174
Don't come back
to the apartment tonight.

01:33:18.969 --> 01:33:21.529
I don't know, maybe you could stay
with your night school friend.

01:33:24.308 --> 01:33:25.976
Maybe she has
some use for this.

01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:29.355
It's probably
fake, right?

01:33:33.984 --> 01:33:36.278
Lisa! Lisa... Lisa!

01:33:47.248 --> 01:33:50.000
I cut the crust off.
Just how you like it.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.419
Thanks, Ma.

01:33:52.962 --> 01:33:56.549
You're not seriously skipping
that GED test, are you?

01:33:56.757 --> 01:33:57.758
Yeah.

01:33:58.425 --> 01:34:00.594
I mean, I was doing
all that stuff for Lisa.

01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:02.733
If she's not around,
then what's the point?

01:34:02.763 --> 01:34:05.349
My poor baby,
I feel terrible.

01:34:06.183 --> 01:34:08.185
Oh, Gladys, now stop
coddling this boy.

01:34:09.228 --> 01:34:11.647
You know, Theodore,
you're a grown-ass man.

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:13.607
You need to get
your shit together.

01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:14.859
I know, Dad.

01:34:14.942 --> 01:34:19.405
I mean, you say you got
dyslexia, dyscoglia...

01:34:20.072 --> 01:34:22.241
Dyscalculia.
However you say it.

01:34:22.575 --> 01:34:24.368
The issue is,
you're dishonest.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.745
I don't blame that girl
for dumping you.

01:34:26.829 --> 01:34:28.956
Now, Gerald,
that is enough.

01:34:32.042 --> 01:34:33.082
You know, maybe you right.

01:34:34.003 --> 01:34:35.045
Maybe I do deserve it.

01:34:35.129 --> 01:34:36.213
Ya think?

01:34:37.089 --> 01:34:38.716
I was being sarcastic.

01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:41.635
I'll get your bed
ready, baby.

01:34:41.719 --> 01:34:42.928
Would you like a tuck-in?

01:34:43.012 --> 01:34:44.179
Yes, please.

01:34:46.432 --> 01:34:48.100
Thank you, Mom.
Anything for you, darling.

01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:55.399
I failed.

01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:59.403
I failed as a father.

01:35:00.654 --> 01:35:02.364
A tuck-in?

01:35:05.034 --> 01:35:07.095
Oh, my gosh.
Why'd he come on the bus like that?

01:35:07.119 --> 01:35:08.912
I don't know.
He ain't got no friends.

01:35:09.622 --> 01:35:11.123
That's what I think.

01:35:14.043 --> 01:35:15.294
What's the problem?

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.505
Christian Chicken!

01:35:20.382 --> 01:35:22.384
Honk once if you love chicken!

01:35:22.468 --> 01:35:24.887
Honk twice
if you love the Lord.

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:28.474
Come and get your chicken
if you ready to start winning.

01:35:29.266 --> 01:35:31.101
Hey! Sellout!

01:35:31.518 --> 01:35:33.604
What?
You a sellout, man.

01:35:33.687 --> 01:35:35.081
Brother, I'm just tryin'
to make a honest livin'.

01:35:35.105 --> 01:35:36.357
Why don't you
get off my back?

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.150
Go get a job
at the post office then!

01:35:38.233 --> 01:35:40.113
Get your ass up out of here.
What? Say it again.

01:35:40.152 --> 01:35:42.237
Come on, man!
Go ahead with that.

01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:43.447
Stay woke, bro.

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:46.116
Yeah, well, I see you ate the
chicken, you son of a bitch.

01:35:48.911 --> 01:35:51.163
So this is what
it's come to, huh?

01:35:53.874 --> 01:35:55.584
You got some nerve, man.

01:35:56.043 --> 01:35:57.586
Teddy, look...

01:35:58.921 --> 01:36:01.715
I came here to apologize.

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:03.759
I'm on my break.

01:36:03.926 --> 01:36:05.904
I ain't got time for this.
Teddy, please, just listen.

01:36:05.928 --> 01:36:07.447
I don't wanna hear nothin'
you got to say, man.

01:36:07.471 --> 01:36:08.573
No. Please,
just listen to me.

01:36:08.597 --> 01:36:09.658
I don't have nothin'
to say to you!

01:36:09.682 --> 01:36:11.725
I have something to say to you, okay?
What? What?

01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:14.269
Give me 30 seconds, okay?
30 seconds. Go.

01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:17.564
Listen, when we were in high school,
you had everything that I wanted.

01:36:17.648 --> 01:36:19.108
You got 28 seconds left.

01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:20.442
I had grades.
That's all I had.

01:36:20.526 --> 01:36:24.029
You had sports,
friends, girls.

01:36:24.113 --> 01:36:25.823
I sucked at all that.
20.

01:36:25.906 --> 01:36:27.991
I was 27 when I got
my first hand job.

01:36:28.534 --> 01:36:31.912
You're at one, but before I walk
away, I wanna tell you that's sad.

01:36:32.079 --> 01:36:34.331
That's my point. I don't care!
Why you telling me?

01:36:34.415 --> 01:36:36.895
My point is, I was a late bloomer,
and I was desperate and sad.

01:36:36.959 --> 01:36:38.043
And I blamed you.

01:36:38.877 --> 01:36:41.797
And the other night,
when I got my revenge,

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.298
it felt awful.

01:36:43.966 --> 01:36:48.011
I got into education to make a difference
in people's lives, not to ruin them.

01:36:49.179 --> 01:36:50.389
Also,

01:36:50.556 --> 01:36:54.268
I told Stewart here I'd beat his ass
if he didn't come and apologize.

01:36:54.351 --> 01:36:57.312
That is true. That was a part of
it. A small part.

01:36:57.396 --> 01:36:58.772
Okay, you know
what, guys?

01:36:58.856 --> 01:37:02.443
I appreciate the whole "after
school special" moment.

01:37:02.609 --> 01:37:04.737
But understand
that I am okay.

01:37:04.903 --> 01:37:07.364
I am where I'm supposed to be.
All right?

01:37:07.448 --> 01:37:10.242
Your destiny is to work at a fast
food joint next to a strip club?

01:37:10.325 --> 01:37:11.577
Yes. All right?

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.829
If I stand in the right spot
in this parking lot,

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:17.249
I can smell cocoa butter and
fried chicken at the same time.

01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:19.686
And I don't know about you guys,
but that's a win for me.

01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:22.171
Teddy, listen to me.
Ain't no "Teddy, listen."

01:37:22.296 --> 01:37:23.839
You know I wasn't
gonna pass that test,

01:37:23.922 --> 01:37:26.800
so don't sit here and act like it
was gonna be a different story.

01:37:26.884 --> 01:37:29.696
And don't act like you don't wanna be
able to finally say that I'm dumb.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.763
No, you're not.

01:37:30.846 --> 01:37:32.806
You can finally say it, Stew.
Say it!

01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:34.183
Teddy.

01:37:35.309 --> 01:37:37.352
You are a lot of things.

01:37:37.519 --> 01:37:40.063
A hustler, a liar.

01:37:40.397 --> 01:37:41.565
You're very short.

01:37:41.732 --> 01:37:42.941
Mad loud, too.

01:37:43.025 --> 01:37:44.151
Mmm-hmm.

01:37:44.318 --> 01:37:46.487
But you are not dumb!

01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:49.782
Now, this suit you got
on is dumb as hell.

01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:52.075
I rebuke you! Rebuke!

01:37:52.242 --> 01:37:54.286
I rebuke you!
I'm going to work.

01:37:54.411 --> 01:37:55.722
Now, let me go get...
Give me this thing.

01:37:55.746 --> 01:37:57.182
What you doing, Carrie?
Take this off right now.

01:37:57.206 --> 01:37:58.933
Take this suit off,
and you gonna take this test!

01:37:58.957 --> 01:37:59.958
No, no, no.

01:38:00.042 --> 01:38:01.394
No, let's use our words.
You gonna take this test!

01:38:01.418 --> 01:38:02.562
All right, come here.
You know what?

01:38:02.586 --> 01:38:03.772
What you doin'?
She has a belt!

01:38:03.796 --> 01:38:04.880
She's got a belt!

01:38:04.963 --> 01:38:06.381
Take this suit off,

01:38:06.465 --> 01:38:07.734
and you gonna take that test!
Guys, guys, guys!

01:38:07.758 --> 01:38:08.818
We need to keep our hands to ourselves.
You stop!

01:38:08.842 --> 01:38:09.903
You stop!
Get off me! Dang it!

01:38:09.927 --> 01:38:11.237
This gonna hurt me more
than it's gonna hurt you!

01:38:11.261 --> 01:38:13.430
Oh, God! I can't be
a part of this.

01:38:13.514 --> 01:38:15.766
You're breaking the skin!
Tear your ass up.

01:38:15.974 --> 01:38:17.392
Okay, this seems
like a black thing.

01:38:17.476 --> 01:38:19.061
So I'm just gonna
order us some food.

01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:20.270
All right!
Now, listen to me!

01:38:20.354 --> 01:38:21.498
All right!
Are you listening to me?

01:38:21.522 --> 01:38:22.564
Yes!

01:38:22.648 --> 01:38:24.024
Now, you have
worked too hard

01:38:24.107 --> 01:38:27.194
to be running around here
in a damn holy chicken suit.

01:38:27.486 --> 01:38:28.946
Okay?
Yes.

01:38:29.112 --> 01:38:31.114
Now, either you
get in the car

01:38:31.532 --> 01:38:33.492
and you take that test,

01:38:33.784 --> 01:38:36.787
or I continue to
tenderize your ass.

01:38:36.954 --> 01:38:38.372
Your choice.

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:44.920
Are you ready?
Good luck, guys.

01:38:45.712 --> 01:38:47.297
Yeah.
I'm back.

01:38:47.631 --> 01:38:49.091
Hey, Carrie.

01:38:57.182 --> 01:38:58.851
- Teddy!
- Teddy's back!

01:38:58.934 --> 01:39:00.769
<i>Good to see you, bro.
What's up, Ted?</i>

01:39:00.853 --> 01:39:03.063
- Hey, Teddy!
- Teddy! Teddy!

01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:04.273
Yes!

01:39:05.107 --> 01:39:07.442
What up, king?
Come on, man!

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.528
Let's do this.

01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:11.029
A hero returns.

01:39:14.074 --> 01:39:16.201
Okay, we're complete.

01:39:16.368 --> 01:39:20.414
So let's turn on those
computers and ace this thing!

01:39:20.497 --> 01:39:21.540
Go!

01:39:23.125 --> 01:39:24.835
Okay, robot.

01:39:25.335 --> 01:39:27.671
You bowing down
to a god today.

01:39:32.551 --> 01:39:34.177
Good luck, everybody.

01:39:53.989 --> 01:39:55.532
Come on, Teddy.

01:40:01.622 --> 01:40:02.748
<i>Focus.</i>

01:40:03.665 --> 01:40:05.918
<i>Concentrate. Get rid of that
mind chatter.</i>

01:40:06.919 --> 01:40:08.253
Come on, focus!

01:40:08.337 --> 01:40:10.255
Focus!
Oh, God!

01:40:10.339 --> 01:40:12.424
Focus. You better
get it right!

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:14.301
Focus! Focus!

01:40:41.954 --> 01:40:42.955
Yeah!

01:40:44.957 --> 01:40:46.083
Shh.

01:40:49.753 --> 01:40:52.381
Okay, everybody, calm
down. All right?

01:40:52.464 --> 01:40:54.508
The results will be in
online in just a minute.

01:40:54.591 --> 01:40:56.677
If you get over 145,
you pass.

01:40:56.843 --> 01:40:57.970
She's right.

01:40:58.053 --> 01:41:00.031
All right, you do the hard work,
you get rewarded for it.

01:41:00.055 --> 01:41:01.282
No need to panic.

01:41:01.306 --> 01:41:03.016
Hey, hey, hey!
The results just came in.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.726
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:41:05.644 --> 01:41:07.771
I passed! I got a 146!

01:41:07.938 --> 01:41:10.107
146, Mac! Yeah!

01:41:10.273 --> 01:41:11.525
- Way to go.
- Yes, yes!

01:41:11.608 --> 01:41:12.943
Management,
here I come, baby!

01:41:13.026 --> 01:41:14.111
He deserved that.

01:41:14.277 --> 01:41:15.570
168!

01:41:16.822 --> 01:41:18.407
Slim thick!
Whoo!

01:41:18.573 --> 01:41:20.325
I don't have to do
housework anymore!

01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:22.170
<i>I passed! Yo, I passed!</i>
Bobby passed!

01:41:22.244 --> 01:41:23.495
Yes, Bobby!

01:41:23.662 --> 01:41:25.247
<i>165, B!</i>

01:41:25.414 --> 01:41:26.707
Way to go, man!

01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:27.958
I'm goin' to college!

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:29.584
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah. She ready!

01:41:29.668 --> 01:41:31.712
Proud of you, kiddo.
Proud of you, kiddo!

01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:34.214
Guys. Guys.

01:41:34.381 --> 01:41:36.800
I'm gonna be
a dental hygienist.

01:41:36.967 --> 01:41:38.510
"Hygienist." He's saying
"hygienist."

01:41:38.677 --> 01:41:41.555
He's gonna be a dental hygienist.
Yes. Good for you, man!

01:41:41.722 --> 01:41:42.882
Y'all ready for this?

01:41:42.973 --> 01:41:44.725
What?
Jay got a 146!

01:41:44.891 --> 01:41:46.893
Jay got a damn 146!

01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:48.478
Same as you, fam!
Yeah!

01:41:48.645 --> 01:41:50.485
Yeah! Yeah, we won this!
I'm proud of you guys.

01:41:50.605 --> 01:41:52.816
- You said it.
- What you got? Come on, Teddy!

01:41:52.983 --> 01:41:54.735
Come on, Teddy.

01:41:55.485 --> 01:41:56.820
I can't. I can't check it.

01:41:56.987 --> 01:41:59.406
Here, Carrie. Here.
You check mine for me.

01:41:59.573 --> 01:42:01.825
Oh, God! I'm too
nervous, man.

01:42:02.075 --> 01:42:03.243
Come on!

01:42:04.077 --> 01:42:05.495
Genius level.

01:42:05.662 --> 01:42:06.788
That's right.

01:42:07.122 --> 01:42:08.248
Whoo.

01:42:08.707 --> 01:42:09.875
Teddy, I'm sorry.

01:42:10.042 --> 01:42:12.753
Come on, Carrie. Don't play right now.
Just tell me the score.

01:42:12.836 --> 01:42:14.212
Tell me what I got.

01:42:14.296 --> 01:42:15.464
I'm not jokin' with you.

01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:17.966
You didn't pass.

01:42:29.728 --> 01:42:31.688
I got a 117.

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.941
I'm sorry, Teddy.

01:42:35.108 --> 01:42:36.860
It doesn't matter.
You know why?

01:42:36.943 --> 01:42:40.655
Because this is a minor
setback for a major comeback.

01:42:40.739 --> 01:42:41.740
Yes.

01:42:41.823 --> 01:42:44.201
I'mma take the test again, guys.
That's right.

01:42:44.284 --> 01:42:45.327
- You should!
- Yes!

01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:46.450
I'mma take the test again.

01:42:46.536 --> 01:42:48.181
You take it again!
Get back at it again! And take it again.

01:42:48.205 --> 01:42:49.581
I said I'mma take it again!

01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:51.750
Oh, God, he's doing that
thing with his voice.

01:42:52.209 --> 01:42:53.585
Yeah, I know.
I heard it, too.

01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:55.879
I'mma take the test again!

01:43:04.012 --> 01:43:05.573
Is everybody getting
the same numbers? Hey, Marv!

01:43:05.597 --> 01:43:07.390
Yeah?
I failed.

01:43:07.474 --> 01:43:08.809
You failed the test?

01:43:08.892 --> 01:43:10.227
But I'mma take it again!

01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:11.728
That's why you stopped by?

01:43:13.855 --> 01:43:14.981
I failed again.

01:43:15.065 --> 01:43:16.108
Yep.

01:43:16.191 --> 01:43:17.484
But I'mma take it
again though.

01:43:17.651 --> 01:43:19.194
I'mma take it again.

01:43:23.573 --> 01:43:24.616
Hey, y'all.

01:43:24.699 --> 01:43:26.326
I definitely didn't
pass that one.

01:43:26.409 --> 01:43:28.929
I mean, there was a whole section
that I didn't even understand.

01:43:29.162 --> 01:43:30.789
I'mma take it again though.

01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:34.668
You sure
he's not just dumb?

01:43:36.294 --> 01:43:37.963
The new test results
just came in.

01:43:38.296 --> 01:43:39.631
I failed.

01:43:40.215 --> 01:43:42.759
Wait a minute.
Wait, I passed!

01:43:42.843 --> 01:43:44.010
You what?

01:43:44.177 --> 01:43:45.971
A 178. That's like
college, right?

01:43:46.054 --> 01:43:47.264
I passed!

01:43:47.347 --> 01:43:48.390
You passed!

01:43:52.144 --> 01:43:56.022
I passed! I passed!

01:43:56.106 --> 01:43:57.440
<i>You killed it, son!</i>

01:43:57.524 --> 01:43:59.693
I did it, man! I did it!

01:44:00.235 --> 01:44:01.903
Watch your back!
Watch your back!

01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:03.155
Oh, yeah!

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:07.242
Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

01:44:07.325 --> 01:44:08.869
Yes!

01:44:09.578 --> 01:44:12.372
Thank you! Thank you!

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.753
I don't deserve it!

01:44:19.254 --> 01:44:22.382
We, the class of 2018,
represent a generation

01:44:22.465 --> 01:44:24.259
of forward-thinking,

01:44:24.342 --> 01:44:27.220
rule-challenging,
fearless leaders.

01:44:27.429 --> 01:44:31.808
Let us go forward from this day
with confidence and with courage.

01:44:32.142 --> 01:44:33.602
As we cross this stage,

01:44:33.685 --> 01:44:37.189
let us do so with the knowledge
that with faith in ourselves,

01:44:37.272 --> 01:44:39.733
nothing is impossible.

01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:41.401
Thank you.

01:44:47.949 --> 01:44:50.952
Beautiful and inspiring words.
Thank you, Mikayla.

01:44:51.494 --> 01:44:54.039
Now, before we conclude,
I'm sure some of you are wondering

01:44:54.122 --> 01:44:58.084
why we have adult students
with us on stage.

01:44:58.168 --> 01:44:59.961
Well, as you all know,

01:45:00.086 --> 01:45:02.088
I am an innovator.

01:45:02.631 --> 01:45:03.798
A maverick.

01:45:04.591 --> 01:45:07.302
I don't play by the...

01:45:07.928 --> 01:45:11.640
So I have decided for the first
time in Piedmont history,

01:45:11.723 --> 01:45:14.559
to invite our night school
graduates to join our seniors.

01:45:14.643 --> 01:45:17.896
They have elected one of their
own to speak on their behalf.

01:45:18.021 --> 01:45:20.315
It is with great pride

01:45:20.607 --> 01:45:22.859
that I introduce
Mr. Teddy Walker.

01:45:24.486 --> 01:45:25.487
Hey, all right!

01:45:25.654 --> 01:45:26.964
- Go get 'em.
- You got this, Teddy.

01:45:26.988 --> 01:45:30.283
Teddy! Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

01:45:40.126 --> 01:45:43.004
Let me just start off by telling you
guys a little something about me.

01:45:44.506 --> 01:45:48.802
I'm Teddy Walker,
and I'm a liar.

01:45:50.804 --> 01:45:53.974
For years, I've been pretending
to be somebody else.

01:45:54.724 --> 01:45:56.101
Somebody that I'm not.

01:45:57.269 --> 01:45:59.688
My reason for doing that is
because I was ashamed.

01:46:01.773 --> 01:46:04.609
Ashamed that I didn't learn
like my classmates.

01:46:05.902 --> 01:46:08.446
Ashamed that
I couldn't take a test.

01:46:09.489 --> 01:46:12.450
Ashamed that I let my family
and my friends down.

01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:15.620
I put so much time and energy
into creating

01:46:15.704 --> 01:46:18.081
this fake version
of Teddy Walker,

01:46:18.623 --> 01:46:21.376
that I forgot the value that
went into learning in school.

01:46:21.459 --> 01:46:23.586
I'm talking about honesty.

01:46:23.837 --> 01:46:26.006
I'm talking about
accepting who you are.

01:46:26.464 --> 01:46:29.759
And it wasn't until I met my
amazing night school classmates,

01:46:31.594 --> 01:46:34.389
and a teacher
that actually believed in me,

01:46:36.516 --> 01:46:38.935
that I was able
to accept who I was.

01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:43.898
As a loudmouth hustler with a
boatload of learning disabilities.

01:46:53.867 --> 01:46:55.035
You know,

01:46:55.243 --> 01:46:58.788
for any of you who may have struggled
to get it right the first time,

01:46:59.205 --> 01:47:01.207
then I am living proof

01:47:01.708 --> 01:47:05.086
that you can get it together
on a second chance.

01:47:05.879 --> 01:47:07.505
I mean, I done had
a lot of chances.

01:47:07.714 --> 01:47:08.840
Mmm-hmm.

01:47:08.923 --> 01:47:10.050
I messed up a lot.

01:47:10.342 --> 01:47:11.468
Mmm-hmm.

01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:13.887
But I made it
to the other side.

01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:17.199
I mean, hell, we all did.
Ain't that right, night school crew?

01:47:17.223 --> 01:47:18.516
Hell yeah.

01:47:19.392 --> 01:47:20.518
Very true.

01:47:20.685 --> 01:47:22.562
We all got
second chances.

01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:24.022
And to my dad...

01:47:25.357 --> 01:47:27.817
He was tough on me.
He said some things.

01:47:27.984 --> 01:47:29.736
But he said it out of love.

01:47:31.154 --> 01:47:33.031
Dad, I know
you ain't never mean it

01:47:33.114 --> 01:47:35.533
when you used to say some of the
things that you used to say.

01:47:35.617 --> 01:47:37.160
You know, you used
to say stuff like,

01:47:37.243 --> 01:47:39.371
"I wish I ain't
never had you."

01:47:39.454 --> 01:47:43.583
Or like, "That was
a waste of sperm."

01:47:44.959 --> 01:47:47.712
"Oh, God, if I could get that one back."
I remember you said that.

01:47:47.879 --> 01:47:49.714
But all that stuff
was said out of love

01:47:49.798 --> 01:47:51.466
to motivate me and push me.

01:47:52.467 --> 01:47:54.969
And you thought you didn't do
good, but look at me now!

01:47:56.179 --> 01:47:58.848
Anything is possible!

01:48:05.313 --> 01:48:06.356
I did it!

01:48:06.523 --> 01:48:08.358
Yeah! Hurray!
Go, Teddy!

01:48:08.525 --> 01:48:10.777
Hey, Dad! I did it, Dad!

01:48:11.277 --> 01:48:13.613
I told you!
What did I tell you?

01:48:13.696 --> 01:48:16.366
Okay. Okay.

01:48:16.449 --> 01:48:18.618
Yeah!

01:48:19.244 --> 01:48:20.453
Whoo!

01:48:20.537 --> 01:48:23.164
I can't believe I took
off work for this shit.

01:48:27.961 --> 01:48:29.587
Thank you guys
for the flowers!

01:48:35.176 --> 01:48:38.638
Hey! That's Teddy.

01:48:42.851 --> 01:48:44.328
When's the last time
you were in love?

01:48:44.352 --> 01:48:46.563
I work. I have a job.
I'm saving lives.

01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:48.815
Okay. You love your job.
That's what I love to do.

01:48:50.650 --> 01:48:53.945
Oh, there he is, my little smart,
dumbass brother.

01:48:54.028 --> 01:48:55.864
So proud of you.
Thank you.

01:48:55.947 --> 01:48:57.240
Yes.
Good to see you.

01:48:57.323 --> 01:48:59.200
Good to see you. Yes.
Thank you.

01:48:59.284 --> 01:49:00.743
Hi. Give me some, man.
Congrats.

01:49:00.827 --> 01:49:01.911
Thank you, man.

01:49:01.995 --> 01:49:03.597
How do I look? Do I look smart?
You look unbelievable.

01:49:03.621 --> 01:49:05.474
Let me see your smart face.
Hit it. One, two, three.

01:49:05.498 --> 01:49:06.624
Show me the smart face.

01:49:06.708 --> 01:49:07.810
Show it to me.
Okay. That's fine.

01:49:07.834 --> 01:49:09.061
Yeah, it's still stupid.
I love it.

01:49:09.085 --> 01:49:11.254
That's all right.
Okay. All right.

01:49:13.047 --> 01:49:14.340
Call me.

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:18.428
Hey.

01:49:19.596 --> 01:49:21.222
That was a beautiful speech,
Teddy.

01:49:23.141 --> 01:49:25.059
That's the guy
I fell in love with.

01:49:27.604 --> 01:49:29.564
Then allow me
to reintroduce myself.

01:49:31.774 --> 01:49:33.401
I'm Teddy Walker.

01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:36.446
I'm a high school dropout.

01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:38.781
I work at a fast food joint.

01:49:39.824 --> 01:49:41.034
I live with my mom.

01:49:41.993 --> 01:49:43.620
And I take the bus.

01:49:44.454 --> 01:49:45.830
But I would love,

01:49:46.956 --> 01:49:48.666
I would absolutely love it

01:49:51.085 --> 01:49:53.171
if you would let me
take you on a date.

01:49:55.882 --> 01:49:57.926
Nice to meet you,
Teddy Walker.

01:50:01.679 --> 01:50:03.473
I'd like that.

01:50:04.224 --> 01:50:07.852
You're gonna have to pay for everything
because I don't have any money.

01:50:07.936 --> 01:50:09.229
I figured.

01:50:09.312 --> 01:50:11.105
I mean, like, no money.

01:50:11.523 --> 01:50:12.690
I got you.

01:50:14.651 --> 01:50:16.110
<i>Let's do a photo.</i>

01:50:16.194 --> 01:50:17.529
Night school photo.

01:50:17.612 --> 01:50:18.988
"GED" on three.
You ready?

01:50:19.072 --> 01:50:21.407
"GED" on three.
One, two, three.

01:50:21.491 --> 01:50:22.742
GED!

01:50:42.136 --> 01:50:43.680
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:50:43.846 --> 01:50:45.431
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:50:45.515 --> 01:50:47.100
What is going on?

01:50:47.517 --> 01:50:49.143
It's "turn up"
time, Stewart.

01:50:49.519 --> 01:50:52.730
Well, this is my house!

01:50:52.981 --> 01:50:53.982
Prove it!

01:51:12.083 --> 01:51:14.377
Get buck!
Get buck! Get buck!

01:51:14.877 --> 01:51:16.546
Get buck! Get buck!
