TONY:
   <i>Alex, take a look at this.</i>

01:19.978 --> 01:23.581
<i>I have a date with the girl</i>
      <i>in the suntan oil ad.</i>

01:23.583 --> 01:24.548
Her name is Randi.
       Oh...

01:24.583 --> 01:25.984
She's agreed to
                 go out with me,

01:26.018 --> 01:27.585
but she wants me to bring
             somebody else along

01:27.619 --> 01:28.887
to go out with
               her older sister.

01:28.921 --> 01:30.722
What do you say?
Oh, I don't know, Tony.

01:30.756 --> 01:31.989
Come on, do one for me,

01:32.024 --> 01:33.858
please, please, please.
 No, I...

01:33.926 --> 01:35.026
Oh, all right, okay.

01:35.060 --> 01:36.194
Oh, great, Alex.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.529
We're meeting them at 8:30,

01:37.563 --> 01:39.197
at this French place
              in the Village.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.766
<i>La Belle Chateau.</i>

01:41.801 --> 01:45.103
Oh, French food!

01:45.137 --> 01:47.739
Sounds like a terrific evening.

01:47.773 --> 01:49.240
It's gonna be a
             great evening, Jim.

01:49.274 --> 01:52.077
Oh, la la la la la!

01:52.111 --> 01:56.480
<i>Ah, la cuisine fran√ßaise</i>
         <i>est magnifique.</i>

01:56.515 --> 01:59.184
<i>C'est la plus bonne de monde.</i>

01:59.218 --> 02:01.653
Hey, Jim, you're
speaking French.

02:01.687 --> 02:03.488
<i>Moi?</i>

02:06.425 --> 02:10.228
All right, attention,
    cabbies, attention here.

02:10.229 --> 02:13.297
All right, yesterday,

02:13.331 --> 02:16.467
Latka Gravas was
       test driving a cab

02:16.469 --> 02:20.605
when suddenly, the engine
              burst into flames.

02:20.673 --> 02:23.374
Our Latka got out of the cab

02:23.409 --> 02:25.977
and beat the flames
      out with his jacket,

02:26.011 --> 02:29.347
risking life and limb
     to save that vehicle.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.015
(applause)

02:31.049 --> 02:34.653
Therefore, I am pleased
                to present Latka

02:34.687 --> 02:36.754
with the
  Employee of the Month Award.

02:36.789 --> 02:37.889
(applause)

02:37.957 --> 02:40.091
Latka, would you
                  like to say

02:40.125 --> 02:42.193
a few words
                to the cabbies?

02:44.830 --> 02:47.499
Thank you very much.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.534
I am a dope.

03:02.381 --> 03:05.282
Madame, I can seat you now.

03:05.317 --> 03:07.385
Will you be dining...
uh...?

03:07.419 --> 03:09.620
Uh, are you, uh...

03:09.655 --> 03:10.788
Alone?

03:10.823 --> 03:12.557
Is that what you're
             trying to say?

03:12.591 --> 03:14.492
Yes, I will
            be dining alone.

03:14.526 --> 03:16.193
No one else is coming.

03:16.228 --> 03:19.296
We're all here.

03:19.331 --> 03:22.166
Uh, excuse me, this is
    my first time dining alone,

03:22.200 --> 03:24.569
so I just wanted
         to ask you one thing.

03:24.603 --> 03:26.571
Where are lonely,
              desperate women

03:26.605 --> 03:28.973
usually seated
     in the better restaurants?

03:29.007 --> 03:31.008
Table four.

03:35.181 --> 03:39.951
Hey... now, this
              is a classy place.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.552
I know, I came
here years ago

03:41.587 --> 03:44.389
when they only
had one brick wall.

03:44.423 --> 03:46.090
Oh, my God.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.759
Uh, waiter, waiter!

03:47.793 --> 03:48.926
Waiter!
  Oh, madame...

03:48.961 --> 03:50.395
something is wrong?

03:50.429 --> 03:52.196
Yes, my ex-husband
        just walked in.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.199
Is there a side door

03:54.233 --> 03:57.068
or a meat locker
        I could hide in?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.870
I'm sorry.

03:58.904 --> 04:01.172
I don't know why I let you
        talk me into this, Tony.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.374
Come on!
Oh, dear.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.645
Alex!

04:06.679 --> 04:08.812
ALEX: Huh?
TONY: There she is!

04:08.881 --> 04:11.415
Oh.
            Isn't she beautiful?

04:12.318 --> 04:15.519
TONY:
Alex, there she is again!

04:18.656 --> 04:19.757
Hi, Tony.
TONY: Hi.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.459
I'd like you to meet
               my sister, Candi.

04:21.493 --> 04:22.894
Hi, Candi.
    Randi, Candi,

04:22.928 --> 04:24.629
I'd like you to meet
        my friend, Alex.

04:24.730 --> 04:25.830
Hi.
      Hi.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.031
Hi! (chuckles)

04:28.968 --> 04:31.069
Uh, how long have
you two been twins?

04:31.103 --> 04:35.240
(laughing)

04:35.274 --> 04:37.275
I feel silly, right,
but I love feeling silly.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.184
Sorry I'm late.

04:46.218 --> 04:48.119
What do you
    mean late?

04:48.153 --> 04:49.554
What are you doing here?

04:49.588 --> 04:51.255
I assumed
                  I was invited.

04:51.289 --> 04:52.557
You weren't!

04:52.591 --> 04:54.525
Well, you're lucky
            I made that mistake,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.827
or I never would've
                    gotten here.

04:56.896 --> 05:00.598
Uh, Jim Ignatowski, this
is Candi and Randi Moratta.

05:00.632 --> 05:01.966
Oh.
                     Our dates--

05:02.001 --> 05:03.034
mine and Alex's.

05:03.068 --> 05:04.402
Ours, ours.

05:04.436 --> 05:05.603
How do?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.605
How's it going?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.774
Egg split in the womb, huh?

05:09.808 --> 05:12.343
Jim, Jim,
    Jim, Jim...

05:12.377 --> 05:13.644
Jim.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.280
Alex?
                        Huh?

05:16.314 --> 05:17.848
I got a real problem here.

05:17.883 --> 05:19.517
Yeah, yeah,
                 I know, I know.

05:19.551 --> 05:20.685
Would you ladies
                   excuse us?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.287
Uh, we have something
         to straighten out here.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.821
I'm having a great
time here, Alex.

05:23.855 --> 05:27.658
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
                  listen, Jim...

05:27.727 --> 05:29.427
Oh, my God.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.196
Oh, my God, my ex-wife.

05:32.230 --> 05:33.631
Uh, Jim, uh,
             would you tell them

05:33.666 --> 05:35.266
to excuse me for
             just a few minutes?

05:35.301 --> 05:37.968
See, I'm coming in
handy already.

05:38.003 --> 05:38.936
Yeah.

05:53.285 --> 05:55.453
Phyllis.
                   Oh, hi, Alex.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.621
You, uh, you look terrific.

05:59.324 --> 06:00.324
You've lost weight.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.659
Yeah, 35 pounds.

06:01.693 --> 06:02.860
Wow, how'd you do that?

06:02.895 --> 06:04.996
The grief diet.

06:05.030 --> 06:06.998
Your husband divorces you

06:07.032 --> 06:10.034
and then you cry
  and vomit for three months.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.402
(uneasy laugh)

06:11.436 --> 06:13.571
No, I mean, uh, I'm,
    I'm really sorry to hear

06:13.606 --> 06:15.340
that your second marriage
   didn't work out, Phyllis.

06:15.374 --> 06:17.141
Well, hey, you know,
                   I'll survive.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.642
Look at me.

06:18.677 --> 06:20.644
I'm back in
            circulation already.

06:20.679 --> 06:22.213
Oh, who're you with?

06:22.248 --> 06:24.349
Him.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.883
You know, he's always

06:25.918 --> 06:27.951
so interested
               that other people

06:27.986 --> 06:30.388
are having a good time.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.625
Hey, come on, Phyllis,
you're dining alone, right?

06:34.659 --> 06:36.594
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.696
Well, I'm not ashamed.

06:38.730 --> 06:40.564
I mean, I'm really glad
      to be dining alone.

06:40.599 --> 06:42.766
Could I just ask you
       one thing, though?
What?

06:42.801 --> 06:46.471
Is it rude to talk to yourself
     with your mouth full?

06:46.473 --> 06:48.406
Alex, we're still over here!

06:48.440 --> 06:49.774
TONY:
       Come on over here.

06:49.808 --> 06:52.843
Uh, listen, Phyllis, I'm, I'm
neglecting my company, uh...

06:52.878 --> 06:55.846
Oh, right, listen,
                go back to them.

06:55.881 --> 06:57.548
I mean, (chuckles)

06:57.583 --> 07:00.150
I can see you got a pretty
  big night ahead of you, huh?

07:00.185 --> 07:02.387
No, no, no, it's not a big
night, it's not a big night.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.855
Oh, it's not a big night?
No, no, no.

07:03.889 --> 07:05.155
Oh, well, then
      what is a big night?

07:05.190 --> 07:06.257
Triplets?

07:09.495 --> 07:10.795
(sighs)

07:10.829 --> 07:13.164
Well, it was really nice
   seeing you again, Phyllis.

07:13.198 --> 07:14.799
Alex, before you go, don't go.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.267
But, Phyllis,
I have to, uh...

07:16.302 --> 07:17.468
Alex, please.

07:17.502 --> 07:20.971
I'm gonna be staying
          at the Mayflower Hotel

07:21.006 --> 07:24.475
through next Tuesday, and
        I just... I just thought

07:24.510 --> 07:27.445
it would be really good
             if we spent some of
             that time together.

07:27.479 --> 07:29.346
Yeah.
                 Or most of that
                  time together.

07:29.381 --> 07:31.348
Or every waking moment
                 of that time...

07:31.383 --> 07:34.485
Look, Phyllis, Phyllis, look,
if-if-if you want to talk,

07:34.520 --> 07:36.087
just give me a call, okay?

07:36.121 --> 07:37.421
Please.
       Listen, Alex, no, really,

07:37.456 --> 07:39.357
I understand that you
        have to be running along

07:39.391 --> 07:42.093
to your little pagan ritual,

07:42.127 --> 07:46.030
but I just want to ask you
      one thing right now, okay?

07:46.064 --> 07:48.633
I mean, even after
                  all this time,

07:48.667 --> 07:51.235
is there still
                something there?

07:53.238 --> 07:54.973
Sure, sure, sure.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.507
Of course there's
        something there.

07:56.541 --> 07:59.243
I mean, uh, if you were
    walking down the street

07:59.277 --> 08:02.346
and a safe was about to fall on
 you, I would yell, "Look out".

08:04.216 --> 08:07.018
Me, too.

08:07.052 --> 08:09.387
Phyllis, not wanting
   to see you get pulverized

08:09.421 --> 08:11.990
is a far cry
     from a reconciliation.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.257
Will you excuse me?

08:14.326 --> 08:17.195
Oh, Alex...
                      Huh?

08:17.229 --> 08:20.498
When I'm reaching out
to you like this,

08:20.533 --> 08:25.336
when I'm this vulnerable,
when I'm this manipulative,

08:25.370 --> 08:28.139
I just don't believe
that you can get up
from this table

08:28.173 --> 08:31.943
and just walk away
from me like this.

08:31.977 --> 08:34.712
Uh, look, uh, uh,
                  Phyllis, look,

08:34.746 --> 08:37.782
the best thing that I can
do for you right now is,

08:37.816 --> 08:41.653
uh, to be as honest and
as clear as I know how.

08:43.589 --> 08:45.823
We're...

08:45.858 --> 08:50.327
We're simply just not involved
 in each other's lives anymore.

08:50.362 --> 08:52.096
Understand?

08:56.968 --> 08:58.569
So, I just put
an end to things

08:58.604 --> 08:59.803
right then and there.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.339
I think I did
the right thing.

09:01.373 --> 09:02.773
You think I did
the right thing?

09:02.807 --> 09:04.242
I'm sure I did
the right thing.

09:04.276 --> 09:05.876
Aren't you sure
I did the right thing?

09:05.910 --> 09:07.311
Yes, you did
                the right thing.

09:07.346 --> 09:08.479
How could you say that?

09:08.514 --> 09:09.880
The woman is all alone.

09:09.915 --> 09:12.917
Alex, you can't
         make it easy for her.

09:12.951 --> 09:14.318
All you can do

09:14.352 --> 09:16.554
is you can help her
         postpone all the stuff

09:16.588 --> 09:19.057
that she's gonna have to
eventually deal with anyway.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.059
The only way you can help
your ex-wife is if you care,

09:22.094 --> 09:25.329
I mean, really care enough
to get involved with her again.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.764
Do you?

09:26.799 --> 09:28.166
No!

09:28.168 --> 09:29.667
Well, then you were
absolutely right

09:29.701 --> 09:31.135
in being as rotten
as you were.

09:31.169 --> 09:33.938
Oh, Elaine, come on,
            don't do that to me.

09:33.973 --> 09:36.273
No, really, I did the
          right thing, didn't I?

09:36.308 --> 09:38.042
Yes, you did.
                    Oh...

09:38.076 --> 09:40.378
Don't touch me.

09:45.951 --> 09:47.918
Personally...

09:50.722 --> 09:53.690
I love divorced women.

09:53.725 --> 09:57.461
I love women who just
broke up with guys.

09:57.495 --> 10:00.831
I live on the rebound.

10:00.865 --> 10:02.766
I love the rebound.

10:02.801 --> 10:04.302
I <i>am</i> the rebound.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.471
Now, come here,
     come here, come here,

10:07.506 --> 10:08.606
come here, come here.

10:09.707 --> 10:11.675
Look, I don't, I don't
tell this to anybody

10:11.709 --> 10:14.946
because I don't want
anybody to find out.

10:14.980 --> 10:17.081
You want desperate women?

10:17.115 --> 10:20.218
Desperate, desperate, women?

10:20.285 --> 10:23.888
I know where to go
where there are girls

10:23.922 --> 10:27.557
who just failed
their bar exam.

10:30.929 --> 10:34.799
You look like a lawyer
to me, honey.

10:34.833 --> 10:37.401
The greatest date I ever had

10:37.436 --> 10:40.671
was with a girl who flunked
the police academy

10:40.705 --> 10:44.542
because she couldn't
do 12 push-ups.

10:44.576 --> 10:46.544
At least, not on the exam.

10:46.578 --> 10:49.680
(goofy chuckle)

10:52.451 --> 10:54.585
Thanks for sharing
            that with me, Louie.

10:54.619 --> 10:56.687
Excuse me, I have to
            go boil my ears now.

11:00.525 --> 11:02.125
Pearls.

11:13.171 --> 11:14.872
Hello?

11:14.906 --> 11:17.307
Is Alex Reiger here?

11:17.342 --> 11:19.744
Nah, he's working.
                   He's working.

11:23.081 --> 11:26.184
You... you're not his ex-wife,
            are you?

11:26.218 --> 11:28.251
Yes, I am.

11:28.353 --> 11:29.553
I was just
in the neighborhood,

11:29.587 --> 11:31.923
and I thought I just
might catch him in.

11:31.957 --> 11:35.459
You know, to say hello.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.962
Well, he's, uh, out on the road.

11:38.997 --> 11:41.465
He won't be back for 12 hours.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.535
I'll wait.

11:55.247 --> 11:58.316
Uh, I, I know
it's none of my business,

11:58.350 --> 12:01.151
but I just want, uh, to tell you

12:01.186 --> 12:03.020
that I feel for you,

12:03.055 --> 12:06.157
what with your life
       in shreds and all.

12:06.191 --> 12:07.991
Oh, thank you.

12:10.896 --> 12:15.032
Whoever are you?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.168
My name's Louie De Palma.

12:17.202 --> 12:18.336
Oh.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.137
I'm a real close friend
of Alex.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.372
Oh.

12:21.406 --> 12:23.908
Yeah. Yeah, I-I guess
he's told you all about me?

12:23.942 --> 12:25.676
No.
        Good.

12:27.212 --> 12:30.214
Well, he's told me
    all about you.

12:30.248 --> 12:34.251
How, uh, witty and charming
and intelligent you are.

12:34.285 --> 12:35.519
Oh.

12:35.621 --> 12:39.123
And, uh, if you don't
mind my saying,

12:39.157 --> 12:42.927
you're also really easy
on the blinkers.

12:46.231 --> 12:48.532
How you talk-- it...

12:48.567 --> 12:49.733
(laughs)

12:49.768 --> 12:52.870
So, listen, you want to go out?

12:52.904 --> 12:54.404
Oh, I'm busy, uh...

12:54.439 --> 12:55.773
But I didn't say when.

12:55.807 --> 12:58.142
Oh, say when.

12:58.176 --> 13:00.410
Tonight.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.180
I'm busy.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.181
All right, all right.

13:04.215 --> 13:06.283
I'm, I'm... I'm sorry, uh,
     for being so forward.

13:06.317 --> 13:08.819
It's... it's just that
   this feeling came over me

13:08.854 --> 13:12.990
that, uh, this would be
    my first and last chance

13:13.024 --> 13:15.893
to ever spend even a little time

13:15.927 --> 13:19.030
with a really elegant woman.

13:23.101 --> 13:26.304
That was so well put.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.738
Yeah.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.508
Well, you know,
      this may be a sewer,

13:31.543 --> 13:35.246
but that doesn't mean
   it can't have its daisies.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.951
Well, like, uh,

13:40.985 --> 13:43.920
uh, what do you suppose we'd do

13:43.955 --> 13:46.056
together, you know?

13:46.124 --> 13:48.326
Make for me a memory

13:48.360 --> 13:52.330
that would haunt the remainder
      of my days on earth.

13:54.098 --> 13:56.166
You know, either the
             fumes in this place

13:56.201 --> 13:58.168
are affecting
                  my judgment...

14:01.807 --> 14:04.141
...or you're kind of cute.

14:10.148 --> 14:13.751
I was afraid there for a moment
you wouldn't notice.

14:13.785 --> 14:16.453
How about
if I pick you up at 8:00?

14:17.522 --> 14:19.957
Why not?
              (laughs)

14:19.991 --> 14:21.224
(laughs)

14:21.259 --> 14:23.226
I'm at the
                Mayflower Hotel.

14:23.261 --> 14:25.362
Oh, yeah,
yeah, I know.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.264
(both laughing giddily)

14:27.332 --> 14:29.700
(stops laughing)
                     What? What?
               What? What? What?

14:29.735 --> 14:32.235
Oh, nothing, nothing,
nothing. Just, uh...

14:32.270 --> 14:34.438
(laughs,
then stops abruptly)

14:34.472 --> 14:35.806
What? What?
                     What? What?

14:35.840 --> 14:36.973
Nothing!

14:37.008 --> 14:38.542
(both laughing)

14:38.544 --> 14:40.311
(stops laughing)

14:40.345 --> 14:43.180
Maybe I shouldn't
do this, you know?

14:43.214 --> 14:44.982
I hope I'm not dreaming.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.987
(laughs heartily)

15:05.904 --> 15:07.337
Bingo!

15:11.943 --> 15:13.610
He's coming!
  Here, you got to read this.

15:13.645 --> 15:15.579
Oh, Louie, I...
          Yes, you got to do it.

15:15.647 --> 15:16.980
You read this.
                  Louie, I don't
                want to do this.

15:17.015 --> 15:18.482
You do it. You do it.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.918
I don't want to do it.
It's stupid!
                It's not stupid.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.986
You do... you do it
              when he gets up...

15:25.157 --> 15:26.357
There you go, Louie.

15:26.391 --> 15:27.591
(humming)

15:27.625 --> 15:29.260
(reading):
"Say, Louie..."

15:29.294 --> 15:31.228
Uh, yes, Jeff?

15:31.262 --> 15:34.098
"I hear you have
a date tonight."

15:34.132 --> 15:35.933
Uh, yes,
       that-that's true.

15:35.967 --> 15:39.904
Yes, as a matter of fact,
  I've got a <i>hot</i> date tonight.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.173
She's got class,

15:42.207 --> 15:44.175
beauty

15:44.209 --> 15:46.577
and <i>experience.</i>

15:46.611 --> 15:48.779
Here.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.480
"Would I know her,
Louie?"

15:52.984 --> 15:55.419
No, I don't
                 believe you do,

15:55.453 --> 15:57.588
but Reiger might.

15:58.756 --> 16:00.291
I don't think
he heard it.

16:00.325 --> 16:01.725
Wait a minute.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.460
Whoa. Come on now.
We got to do it again.

16:03.495 --> 16:04.794
Come on.
Hurry up.
                  Again?! Louie,

16:04.863 --> 16:06.096
this is childish.
Come on!

16:08.432 --> 16:10.367
(clears throat)

16:13.604 --> 16:15.539
"Say, Louie..."

16:17.709 --> 16:19.043
Yes, Jeff?

16:19.077 --> 16:21.211
"I hear
   you have a date tonight."

16:21.245 --> 16:22.379
Uh, yes, Jeff.

16:22.413 --> 16:24.381
Well, I guess
this is where I came in.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.150
Who have you got a date
with tonight?

16:26.184 --> 16:28.118
Beat it. Beat
                    it. Beat it.

16:29.587 --> 16:32.956
I'll give you a hint.

16:32.990 --> 16:35.392
The answer is right
                under your nose,

16:35.427 --> 16:37.428
but then again,
                     what isn't?

16:38.697 --> 16:42.733
All right, I guess
               I should find out

16:42.767 --> 16:45.068
how you feel about
               this because, uh,

16:45.102 --> 16:47.170
I remember once

16:47.204 --> 16:49.840
you got mad

16:49.874 --> 16:51.742
because I
                 used your comb.

16:54.145 --> 16:56.180
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:56.214 --> 16:58.348
Aha! Aha!

16:58.382 --> 17:00.884
Got your curiosity
                  up there, huh?

17:00.919 --> 17:02.419
Oh, yes, oh, yes.

17:02.453 --> 17:05.055
You're so sophisticated
                and intelligent.

17:05.123 --> 17:07.656
You go out with a
           whole different class

17:07.692 --> 17:10.060
of women than old
            Louie De Palma, huh?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.432
Not necessarily.

17:14.465 --> 17:17.001
This happens to be a woman

17:17.035 --> 17:19.469
that you've dated.

17:19.503 --> 17:21.070
Louie, it's been
                     a long day.

17:21.106 --> 17:22.306
Will you cut the crap?

17:22.339 --> 17:24.241
I've been out with
                 a lot of women,

17:24.276 --> 17:25.474
and it's just possible

17:25.510 --> 17:27.344
that you might have
              dated one of them.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.179
So, what's the big deal?

17:33.618 --> 17:35.585
How big a deal would it be

17:35.620 --> 17:37.922
if it was your ex-wife?

17:39.291 --> 17:41.158
Hmm?

17:41.192 --> 17:42.926
Phyllis?

17:42.960 --> 17:44.862
Hey, now, wait a minute!

17:44.963 --> 17:46.363
Now, wait a minute!
Whoa, whoa.

17:46.397 --> 17:47.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.633
I don't want you
              to do that, Louie.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.001
Now, she's weak,
               she's vulnerable,

17:51.035 --> 17:53.471
and she might mistake
          you for a human being.

17:53.505 --> 17:54.638
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:54.673 --> 17:55.806
Go easy, easy, easy.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.140
Oh, what is
                  going on here?
                    Easy.

17:57.175 --> 17:58.408
ALEX:
I'll tell you what's

17:58.477 --> 18:00.244
going on here.
He's got a date with my ex-wife.

18:00.278 --> 18:02.780
Hey, Phyllis and I
     are consenting adults,

18:02.814 --> 18:04.949
and you have nothing
        to say about it.

18:04.983 --> 18:06.416
I am a busy man.

18:06.485 --> 18:07.384
LOUIE:
                           Jeff?

18:07.419 --> 18:08.585
"Say, Louie,

18:08.619 --> 18:09.753
I hear you
                 have a date..."

18:09.787 --> 18:11.688
No, no, no, no.

18:11.690 --> 18:15.493
Oh, it sickens me to say this,
   Alex, but, uh, he's right.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.361
There's nothing
            you can do about it.

18:28.005 --> 18:29.940
(knocking)

18:33.311 --> 18:34.745
Look, Phyllis...
             Alex, what's wrong?

18:34.779 --> 18:37.715
The Doublemint sisters
kicked you out?

18:37.749 --> 18:40.951
Phyllis, you can't go out
      with Louie De Palma!

18:40.986 --> 18:43.620
Alex, what are you
         talking about?

18:43.654 --> 18:45.622
I mean, Louie seems real nice.

18:45.656 --> 18:49.159
I mean, I'll admit he won't make
  anybody forget Paul Newman.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.460
Phyllis...

18:50.494 --> 18:51.661
Or Edwin Newman.

18:51.696 --> 18:52.896
Phyllis...

18:52.931 --> 18:54.264
Or Alfred E.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.633
Phyllis!

18:55.667 --> 18:57.567
Will you
                   listen to me?

18:57.601 --> 18:59.702
Louie is a terrible,
        rotten, low-life person,

18:59.737 --> 19:01.471
and if you're using
                  Louie De Palma

19:01.505 --> 19:03.307
to get over that Brazilian
            ex-husband of yours,

19:03.341 --> 19:04.574
then I shudder to think

19:04.608 --> 19:06.876
who you're gonna use to
        get over Louie De Palma.

19:06.878 --> 19:09.079
Alex, I don't know why
you're acting like this,

19:09.113 --> 19:11.081
but you're behaving
like a crazy person!

19:11.116 --> 19:13.049
Phyllis, everything
              I've said thus far

19:13.084 --> 19:14.885
about Louie, his mother
               would agree with.

19:14.919 --> 19:16.253
In fact, I'm
                    quoting her.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.987
Alex, will you stop it now?

19:18.022 --> 19:19.289
Just stop it.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.657
I'm a single person,

19:20.692 --> 19:23.527
and there's a new Phyllis
to explore.

19:23.562 --> 19:24.695
But-but-but
                    Phyl, but...

19:24.729 --> 19:26.664
(knocking)
    Okay.

19:26.698 --> 19:29.099
Now will you please save us all
   any further embarrassment

19:29.134 --> 19:30.868
and get into that bathroom

19:30.936 --> 19:34.872
until my date and I have left
        for our evening?

19:34.906 --> 19:36.039
(sighs)

19:36.073 --> 19:37.307
You're right.

19:37.341 --> 19:38.509
I feel foolish.

19:38.543 --> 19:40.343
I feel like I've
            insulted my dignity.

19:40.378 --> 19:42.880
I welcome the opportunity
        to cower in your toilet.

19:48.486 --> 19:49.853
Hi, Phyllis.

19:49.887 --> 19:50.987
Hi, Louie.

19:51.021 --> 19:52.556
I'll be ready
                    in a minute.

19:52.590 --> 19:54.023
Great!

19:54.058 --> 19:57.160
'Cause have I got an evening
        planned for us!

20:02.800 --> 20:05.201
I already called room service,

20:05.236 --> 20:09.906
and they are sending up
          champagne...

20:09.940 --> 20:11.908
canap√©s...

20:11.942 --> 20:13.877
and oxygen.

20:33.898 --> 20:37.901
It's nice to see someone not
caught up in the exercise fads.

20:41.739 --> 20:45.042
I have my own form of exercise.

20:45.076 --> 20:46.610
Ee-ee, ee-ee, ee-ee.

20:46.644 --> 20:47.911
PHYLLIS:
                             Oh,

20:47.945 --> 20:49.646
Alex!

20:50.548 --> 20:51.848
Reiger!

20:51.883 --> 20:53.984
What are you,
      some kind of weirdo?

21:00.691 --> 21:03.694
And I thought
  you two wouldn't hit it off.

21:05.196 --> 21:07.531
Well, I'll just leave you
   and your gentleman caller

21:07.565 --> 21:09.266
to explore the new Phyllis.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.534
Alex, you can't go.

21:10.568 --> 21:11.802
You can't go.

21:11.836 --> 21:13.103
Why?

21:13.137 --> 21:14.571
I'm in the
                       way here.

21:14.605 --> 21:17.441
I mean, I can
                    take a hint.

21:17.475 --> 21:18.876
Alex, Alex!
Okay, you were right.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.577
I'm sorry.
I apologize, okay?

21:20.611 --> 21:21.745
You were right.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.046
You were real...

21:23.080 --> 21:24.615
Wait a minute.

21:24.649 --> 21:26.884
Did you put him up to this?

21:28.953 --> 21:30.521
Wait a minute here.

21:30.555 --> 21:33.690
Is this something
     that you two cooked up

21:33.725 --> 21:36.059
in that little garage there

21:36.093 --> 21:38.762
so you would have to come in
         and rescue me?

21:38.796 --> 21:41.198
(laughs)

21:41.232 --> 21:42.999
No, of course not.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.268
Oh, come on!

21:44.302 --> 21:46.436
No real person
acts like that.

21:48.172 --> 21:50.774
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:50.808 --> 21:52.409
Hey, wait a
                    minute here.

21:52.443 --> 21:55.345
What is there,
              some kind of weird
              place in Manhattan

21:55.379 --> 21:58.482
where you rent
                 out these guys?

22:00.518 --> 22:03.387
I-I'm starting to feel
 a little self-conscious here.

22:12.096 --> 22:14.164
Uh...

22:14.198 --> 22:17.200
excuse me, but, uh,
    did it ever occur to you

22:17.234 --> 22:19.469
that our date was over?

22:21.406 --> 22:23.874
This is your fault, Reiger!

22:23.908 --> 22:27.244
Because I didn't do
anything wrong this time.

22:27.278 --> 22:30.413
You said you didn't want
to get involved.

22:30.448 --> 22:32.783
And you end up walking
out of the bathroom.

22:32.817 --> 22:34.885
I mean, now, what-what...
what's going on here?

22:34.919 --> 22:36.553
I don't understand.

22:36.587 --> 22:39.222
You don't understand because
   you've never been married.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.057
You've never been engaged.

22:41.092 --> 22:43.660
You've never been invited
 to a wedding for that matter.

22:43.694 --> 22:45.796
Now there's something
     that happens to people

22:45.830 --> 22:48.331
when, for six years,
    they go to bed together

22:48.366 --> 22:49.933
and they get up together,

22:49.967 --> 22:51.835
who have some kind
        of a connection

22:51.869 --> 22:54.371
because they were married
 and because they had a child.

22:54.405 --> 22:55.672
And if that's not true,

22:55.706 --> 22:57.507
then something's wrong
       with you or life.

22:57.541 --> 23:00.010
I mean, something's wrong.

23:00.044 --> 23:02.512
You want to go out
        and eat with me?

23:02.546 --> 23:04.615
Oh, Alex,

23:04.649 --> 23:06.783
you're so sweet.

23:06.818 --> 23:09.185
And I really know
             that you're worried

23:09.219 --> 23:11.555
about just even going
               on a date with me

23:11.589 --> 23:12.823
'cause you're afraid

23:12.857 --> 23:14.491
that suddenly I'll
                drive you crazy,

23:14.525 --> 23:17.795
and then I'll be neurotic,
    and I'll be crazy, you know,

23:17.829 --> 23:19.730
be demanding and...

23:22.133 --> 23:24.902
I just really would like
       to put your mind at ease.

23:26.203 --> 23:28.138
But I can't.

23:29.874 --> 23:32.042
Uh, uh, Phyllis? Phyllis?

23:32.076 --> 23:33.743
What?!

23:36.748 --> 23:38.715
I'll call you next week.

23:44.122 --> 23:46.056
(wry chuckle)

23:47.925 --> 23:49.859
PHYLLIS:
Am I crazy?

23:49.893 --> 23:51.995
I get a kick
out of that guy.

24:02.673 --> 24:04.907
(theme song playing)

24:28.533 --> 24:29.866
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:29.900 --> 24:30.934
(man grumbling)
