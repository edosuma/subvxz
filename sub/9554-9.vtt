Folks, folks, now,
as you're driving home tonight,

01:58.752 --> 02:00.914
I want you
to keep one thing in mind:

02:01.021 --> 02:04.320
Stay out of the trees.

02:04.424 --> 02:05.414
Thank you. Good night.

02:05.525 --> 02:06.424
Thank you very much.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.926
San Francisco.

02:08.027 --> 02:08.926
I can't believe it.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.326
I am so excited.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.365
Joanie, you better forget
about going to San Francisco.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.957
Mom and Dad just aren't going
to let you go, because...

02:15.068 --> 02:16.661
look, no matter how old you are,

02:16.770 --> 02:18.795
you're still their little baby,
you understand?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.897
Yeah, I know, I know.

02:24.144 --> 02:28.672
Hey, what's the frown
on the face of a rising star?

02:30.017 --> 02:31.541
It's Mom and Dad.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.212
They probably won't let me go
to San Francisco.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.551
Okay, the best way
to go on this tour is

02:36.657 --> 02:38.420
to get your
family's blessing, right?

02:38.525 --> 02:39.822
Right.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.225
Well, she's never going
to get my parents' blessing.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.525
Have you gone wacko, Fonz?

02:46.066 --> 02:47.261
Oh... (laughs)

02:47.367 --> 02:50.030
No, you-you don't go wacko.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.035
Good idea.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.435
What's your plan?

02:52.539 --> 02:54.371
My plan is
that you invite your parents

02:54.474 --> 02:55.601
right here to Arnold's,

02:55.709 --> 02:59.338
so they can witness
how fabamundo you are.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.345
Right.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.381
And once
they see how good I am,

03:02.482 --> 03:04.473
then I tell 'em
about San Francisco.

03:04.584 --> 03:05.950
What can they say?

03:06.053 --> 03:08.021
What can they say?
"Go to your room!"

03:08.121 --> 03:10.351
Then they're gonna nail
the door shut.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.627
I am talking
about Leather and the Suedes.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.568
Yeah, last night,
they opened here,

03:58.672 --> 04:00.640
and they are the talk
of the town.

04:00.741 --> 04:05.110

07:55.108 --> 07:56.872
they would call her Leather,
sweetheart?

07:56.976 --> 07:59.207
I was afraid to ask.

You were just wonderful.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.152
I mean, he could have had
a movie career,

09:22.262 --> 09:23.559
and he stayed in school.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.996
Dad, please don't use me
as an example. I'm neutral.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.294
Aw, this is ridiculous!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.266
I don't even know
why we're discussing it.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.996
Well, because open debate

09:31.104 --> 09:33.402
is one of civilization's
greatest assets.

09:33.506 --> 09:34.701
Now-now, the Greeks,
for example--

09:34.808 --> 09:36.503
they started it
with the open forum,

09:36.609 --> 09:38.009
and-and they'd discuss...

09:38.111 --> 09:41.638
You know, sometimes I'm sorry
I ever sent you to college!

09:41.748 --> 09:44.342
Oh, I had such
a nice wedding planned.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.612
We were going
to rent the Orchid Room, but...

09:46.719 --> 09:48.346
What are you talking
about weddings for?

09:48.455 --> 09:49.945
She hasn't even gone
to college yet.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.421
Stop it!
Everyone, just stop it

09:51.524 --> 09:53.618
with the Orchid Room
and the wedding and school!

09:53.726 --> 09:56.855
Everybody is
living my life but me.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.660
Are you ever gonna let me plan
my own life?

10:05.872 --> 10:07.271
(door closes)

10:07.373 --> 10:09.535
I'm not trying to plan her life.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.633
Just her adolescence.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.312
Well, that's dumb.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.384
What do you want to do that for?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.476
No, no, wait, wait,
listen, don't-don't hang up!

10:20.587 --> 10:21.679
(Click)

10:21.788 --> 10:23.256
What'd you hang up for?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.188
I told you not to hang up!

10:25.291 --> 10:26.782
Well, who was that, dear?

10:26.893 --> 10:27.985
It was Joanie, and-and she's...

10:28.094 --> 10:30.154
Well, she must have gotten up
with the birds.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.594
Well, uh, she did...

10:31.698 --> 10:33.689
Listen, do you think I was
too hard on her last night?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.860
- Dad, I... -No, she probably had
something important to do.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.632
She did.
She's running away from home.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.886
<i>AL:
Don't worry.</i>

10:55.989 --> 10:57.286
She's gonna turn up.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.188
I looked everywhere for her.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.988
Bus station, I-l checked the
train station, even the airport.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.154
Went to the Pizza Bowl.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.892
Joanie doesn't go
to the Pizza Bowl.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.331
Yeah, I know,
but I was starving.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.902
Yeah.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.167
Al, Al, if you were 15,
where would you run away to?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.174
Rome.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.573
Oh. Rome?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.941
Yeah. I've always wanted
to see St. Peter's Square.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.275
Oh.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.678
I'd be standing there.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.944
The Pope would come out
on the balcony.

11:25.051 --> 11:28.214
- I'd give him a little wave.
- Yeah.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.312
He'd wave back.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.455
- But I...
- Al, Al, somehow I don't think

11:34.561 --> 11:36.392
Joanie is waving at the Pope.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.055
All right, I'm going out
and look for her some more.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.225
- Okay.
- Now, look, don't be sad.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.802
You want to know sad?

11:42.902 --> 11:45.565
Did I ever tell you
about Rosa Colletti?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.401
- Oh, yeah, Al, you did.
- Oh.

11:47.507 --> 11:51.273
Uh, say, maybe you could find
Joanie in the all-night movie.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.868
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.811
I hope it's one
of those 3-D movies.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.780
She'll never recognize me
in those glasses.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.407
Oh, right, right.
Thanks, Al.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.576
Okay.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.449
- Oh, hi. -RALPH: Hi, Al.
- POTSIE: Hey, Al.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.921
Ralph, Potsie,
what took guys so long?

12:04.023 --> 12:06.515
All right, all right, forget it.
Just give me the scoop.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.855
Was she at the Piccalo's?

12:07.961 --> 12:09.485
They haven't seen her
all day, Rich.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.622
Boy, those Piccalo sisters
are one lusty bunch.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.728
The minute I walked in the door,

12:15.835 --> 12:17.860
there were lips
all over my face.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.166
The big sister, Olive, got me.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.638
It was terrible!

12:21.741 --> 12:23.231
What are you
talking about, Pots?

12:23.343 --> 12:25.072
I had to pull you away from her.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.577
I couldn't break the suction.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.080
How can you guys talk
about the Piccalos

12:29.182 --> 12:32.208
when my sister is out
on the streets, who knows where?

12:34.821 --> 12:35.845
<i>RICHIE:
Did you find Joanie?</i>

12:35.955 --> 12:37.082
Were you able to locate her?

12:37.190 --> 12:38.248
<i>FONZIE:
No, I didn't find her.</i>

12:38.358 --> 12:39.825
But you just
calm yourself, all right?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.292
We're not dealing with
a nutso kid, it's your sister.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.692
It's my sister who ran away.

12:43.796 --> 12:46.095
I think that's kind of nutso.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.031
Hey, guys, anything new?

12:48.134 --> 12:50.034
No, no, not a word.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.628
I don't know where she is. I...

12:52.739 --> 12:55.640
I hate to even try and guess.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.541
Hey, you're really busted up
about this, huh?

12:58.645 --> 12:59.634
Yeah, I'm busted up!

12:59.746 --> 13:00.974
It's my kid sister!

13:01.080 --> 13:02.377
And it's not just me,
it's my parents.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.506
Dad is going crazy.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.550
Mom's been crying all day.

13:05.652 --> 13:09.145
Leather, did she say
anything at all to you?

13:09.255 --> 13:11.121
Well, why would she
say anything to me?

13:11.224 --> 13:12.987
Yeah, right.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.254
I don't know where
she is, she's probably...

13:15.361 --> 13:18.331
probably cold,
probably starving to death.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.298
Leather, how is she eating?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.562
Well, she's not starving,
she just had...

13:27.674 --> 13:28.971
Where is she?

13:29.075 --> 13:30.042
Okay.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.667
She's in my hotel room.

13:31.778 --> 13:32.676
Your ho...

13:32.779 --> 13:34.440
She's in her...

13:34.547 --> 13:35.947
Are you crazy?

13:36.049 --> 13:36.947
Now, Rich...

13:37.050 --> 13:38.312
I'll handle this.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.284
Are you crazy?

13:44.891 --> 13:45.915
She's in your hotel room.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.857
You know, if you were a guy,

13:47.960 --> 13:50.429
I'd rattle your teeth
until they were frazzled.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.999
All right Fonz, let's just go
find her, all right?

13:53.099 --> 13:54.430
Hold it, hold it.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.301
Look, if you drag her back home
she's only gonna run away again.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.874
I know runaways, I've been
with them for three years.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.374
Yeah, she's got
a good point there, Rich.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.843
Good point? Good point?
I don't need good points.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.242
I gotta talk to Joanie.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.871
- I'll talk to her.
- What are you gonna tell her?

14:08.981 --> 14:10.916
- I don't know yet.
- Well, that's not good enough.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.211
Okay.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.013
I'll bring her back here.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.417
That's good enough.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.887
Finally, we got something
that's good enough...

14:16.989 --> 14:18.514
All right, all right,
calm yourself.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.616
Unplug yourself, will you, Rich?

14:32.071 --> 14:34.802
Come on. Come on.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.206
Well, here she is.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.937
I can't guarantee she'll stay.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.275
Well, you... you got her here,
and that's the important thing.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.350
She's a good kid, I like her.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.645
Well, I'll see you, Joanie.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.379
Yeah, see you.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.385
Hey, don't worry.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.921
You're gonna make it someday.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.056
See you, Leather, thanks.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.523
Hey, Leather, hold it.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.965
I know you're gonna be
terrifioso on the road.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.089
(slaps thigh twice)

15:08.441 --> 15:10.876
Thanks, Fonz.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.573
Thanks, Milwaukee.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.125
Joanie... I want to
have a talk with you.

15:28.227 --> 15:32.164
I'm not gonna listen to you,
lam big enough to be on my own.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.096
Oh, yeah, you're big enough
to be on your own,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.429
I'm gonna tell you something,
while you were out on your own,

15:35.535 --> 15:37.093
- I was in here just sweating...
- All right, Rich,

15:37.203 --> 15:38.568
Richard, hold it, hold it.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.463
Now...

15:41.574 --> 15:44.009
I never snowed you before,
I ain't going to snow you now.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.704
Do you want to listen? 'Cause
I don't want to waste my time.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.145
Oh, it'll waste my time,
but I'll listen.

15:49.248 --> 15:52.184
Heyyy.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.185
I hear a lot
of jabbering about, uh,

15:54.287 --> 15:56.118
how you're all grown up
and everything, you know?

15:56.222 --> 15:57.121
Well you're not.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.657
Not yet.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.193
You're 15 going on 20.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.490
Well, a person
has to grow up sometime.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.620
Oh, you hear that Fonz?

16:04.730 --> 16:05.857
A person's got to grow up
sometime.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.091
(mocking): A person's
got to grow up sometime.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.566
Hey, Richie, Richie,
Richie, Richie, Richie...

16:09.669 --> 16:11.159
Richie...

16:11.270 --> 16:14.001
That's right, a person's
gotta grow up sometime,

16:14.106 --> 16:16.405
but not all in one day,
don't rush it.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.171
Joanie, don't make
the same mistake I made.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.939
You made a mistake?

16:21.047 --> 16:23.140
The mistake I made
was not my fault.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.917
Joanie, I was never
15 years old.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.820
I grew up like that.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.484
I went from six years old
to 18 years old.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.255
Well, you did all right.

16:36.362 --> 16:37.693
That's right, I did all right,

16:37.797 --> 16:41.130
but I missed out on a on lot
of good stuff along the way.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.031
I went from hugging
my teddy bear

16:43.135 --> 16:44.660
to hugging the Hooper triplets.

16:46.038 --> 16:49.975
What I'm talking about
here is memories.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.703
Now, this might sound
a little corny.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.678
- I don't want any wisecracks.
- All right.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.681
One day you're gonna
look back on your life

16:56.782 --> 16:59.217
and you're gonna
remember great things.

16:59.318 --> 17:02.220
See, the one thing that
nobody can take away from you

17:02.321 --> 17:03.948
is your memory.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.718
Teenage memories-- yeah,

17:05.825 --> 17:07.348
you got homecoming dances,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.929
you got uh, uh, uh, hay rides.

17:10.029 --> 17:10.996
You got dates...

17:11.097 --> 17:14.066
uh, skipping around maypoles.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.067
Skipping around maypoles?

17:16.167 --> 17:17.465
We wouldn't do that,

17:17.569 --> 17:19.367
but it's something
that Joanie would like.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.032
But I don't like being 15.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.633
It's weird, you know...

17:24.743 --> 17:28.203
I feel grown-up, but nobody
treats me like one.

17:29.615 --> 17:30.707
It hurts.

17:30.816 --> 17:31.840
Yeah.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.352
That's what they
call growing pains.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.246
Every age got growing pains.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.882
That's the way of the world.

17:39.992 --> 17:43.690
But there's a lot of terrific
stuff mixed in there, too.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.133
Now, all I'm telling you
is don't rush it.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.397
You got to live life
one moment at a time.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.495
Because once...
once time goes by,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.631
it never comes back again.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.767
Joanie, just think about it.

18:00.980 --> 18:04.780
You're giving up your one shot
at being 15 years old.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.876
And I want to tell you something
I never told nobody before.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.251
I would have loved
to have your home

18:11.357 --> 18:12.654
and your family.

18:13.726 --> 18:14.750
And, Shortcake,

18:14.860 --> 18:17.921
I would have loved
to have been 15.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.026
My talk's over.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.829
It's up to you.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.027
Carry on, Red.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.798
Good night.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.896
Good luck.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.208
Are you crazy, you little twerp?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.515
Don't "little twerp" me.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.817
You know what Leather did?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.323
She fired me.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.689
She said she didn't want
to break up any families.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.286
Oh... well, that... that's
tough, but believe me,

18:51.397 --> 18:52.557
it's for your own good.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.757
Aw, who says?

18:53.866 --> 18:54.856
Well, didn't you hear
what Fonzie said?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.128
Didn't that make
any sense to you?

18:56.235 --> 18:57.430
Yeah, but that's
not why I'm running.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.902
Wha... Are you telling me
you're gonna run again?

18:59.005 --> 18:59.972
Yeah, I'll get another job,

19:00.072 --> 19:01.233
and you want to know
why I'm leaving?

19:01.340 --> 19:02.569
- Yes, I do.
- You really want to know?

19:02.675 --> 19:05.406
- I said I did.
- You're the reason.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.536
Me?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.046
Yeah.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.676
When I was in the hotel room,
I had a lot of time to think.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.949
And I figured out you're the
real reason I'm running, Rich.

19:18.758 --> 19:19.884
Me?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.393
Yeah, you.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.827
Rich...

19:24.930 --> 19:27.525
do you know hard it is
being your kid sister?

19:27.633 --> 19:29.328
Oh, oh, look,

19:29.435 --> 19:31.995
I yelled at you, I-I'm sorry,
that was really dumb,

19:32.104 --> 19:33.936
but that's no reason
for you to run away now...

19:34.040 --> 19:36.031
No, it's not the yelling.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.837
It's growing up after you.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.172
I'm not Joanie.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.246
I'm always Richie's sister.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.576
Like in school--

19:42.682 --> 19:43.979
you always got good marks,

19:44.083 --> 19:46.552
and they wonder why
Richie's sister doesn't.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.484
And they say how
well-behaved you are.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.715
And wonder why
Richie's sister isn't.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.086
It's always
"Richie's sister" this

19:52.191 --> 19:55.354
and "Richie's sister" that--
I want to be Joanie.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.756
Well, what do you want me to do,
rob a bank or something?

19:58.864 --> 20:02.562
No... then I'll be
the bank robber's sister.

20:02.668 --> 20:05.433
Joanie... I'm your brother.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.472
And you're not gonna
be able to change that.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.870
Yeah, I know.

20:08.974 --> 20:09.942
I've been told.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.976
50 times a day.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.773
Well, don't listen to 'em!
They're dumb.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.315
But I still want
to be Joanie Cunningham.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.214
Well, you are Joanie.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.615
You're a fun person.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.484
Your grades aren't
that bad, and, and, and...

20:23.589 --> 20:26.320
y-you do, uh,
excellent cartwheels.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.483
And I'm cute.

20:27.593 --> 20:28.822
And you're a little conceited,

20:28.928 --> 20:30.395
but that's normal.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.065
Joanie...

20:33.165 --> 20:35.361
you're you.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.663
And in time, people
are gonna know that.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.100
You think I should go home?

20:41.207 --> 20:42.970
Well, see, I-l don't
think you ever...

20:43.075 --> 20:44.600
wanted to leave
in the first place.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.768
Yes, I...

20:47.713 --> 20:49.113
Well, no.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.541
Oh, I don't know.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.483
Look, look, Joanie,
you had some problems.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.783
Now, I wasn't even
aware of them.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.085
But I am now, and I'm
gonna try and help you.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.488
You gonna fail some courses?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.959
Well, uh, no, I'll have
to find another way,

21:03.062 --> 21:04.325
but I'm still gonna help you.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.660
And-and other people
will help you, too.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.267
Then you think I should go home?

21:09.368 --> 21:10.836
Yes. Not for me.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.700
Not even for Mom and Dad.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.705
But because you want to.

21:14.807 --> 21:18.675
You can't solve your problems
by running away from life.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.508
And I want you to think about
what Fonzie said, because, uh,

21:21.614 --> 21:24.242
you don't see too many
40-year-old people

21:24.350 --> 21:26.250
skipping around the maypole.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.413
Yeah, you're right.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.184
You know...

21:32.291 --> 21:33.850
this year is the sock hop.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.395
And, uh, and John Collins,
he asked me to the junior prom.

21:37.496 --> 21:38.759
- Oh? (chuckles)
- And I'm a cheerleader

21:38.864 --> 21:40.332
with the pom-poms
out on the field.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.059
And John Collins,
he is so cute.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.499
He has blond hair and blue eyes,

21:43.602 --> 21:46.094
and he's such a hunk.
I mean...

21:47.640 --> 21:49.938
Yeah...

21:50.042 --> 21:51.976
it-it is fun being 15.

21:52.077 --> 21:52.976
Yeah, it is.

21:53.078 --> 21:55.070
I really liked it.

21:55.181 --> 21:58.150
Of course, you're gonna be much
better at being 15 than I was.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.479
Yeah. (laughs)

21:59.585 --> 22:01.849
Good-bye, fame.

22:01.954 --> 22:02.944
Hello, boring little room.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.489
(laughs)

22:04.590 --> 22:06.991
- That's the way to talk.
- Yeah.

22:07.092 --> 22:09.322
- Okay, I'm gonna go get my coat,
-all right? -Yeah.

I know why she ran away.

It's me.

I'm always correcting her.
