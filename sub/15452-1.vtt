WEBVTT

00:29.427 --> 00:30.678
- Let's go!

00:30.887 --> 00:32.345
Ah, here we go.

00:44.067 --> 00:46.610
- Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

00:46.820 --> 00:48.404
Oli! Oli!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.543
- First time Dad
took me to Gran and Aunt Mary's

01:02.752 --> 01:07.005
for my holiday, I was, I
don't know, eight or nine.

01:07.215 --> 01:08.173
And I remember playing footy with Gran

01:08.383 --> 01:10.509
and my cousins, in the front yard.

01:10.719 --> 01:13.387
You know those days when
everything's perfect?

01:13.596 --> 01:16.056
One of the greatest afternoons of my life.

01:16.266 --> 01:18.434
You see, Gran would form
us all into one team,

01:18.643 --> 01:21.061
and she'd be the other.

01:21.271 --> 01:22.396
It amazes me to think of the hours

01:22.605 --> 01:24.648
and hours she'd spend playing with us.

01:24.858 --> 01:26.734
She never seemed tired.

01:26.943 --> 01:28.736
Later in the afternoon, she'd play Ludo,

01:28.945 --> 01:31.530
or Snakes & Ladders, or Tiddlywinks.

01:31.740 --> 01:34.116
I used to love those games with Gran.

01:34.325 --> 01:35.993
She used to keep an old Monopoly set

01:36.202 --> 01:37.411
hidden under the stairs,

01:37.620 --> 01:39.163
because Mary wouldn't let her play.

01:39.372 --> 01:41.498
You see, real strict
Salvation Army, Mary was.

01:41.708 --> 01:44.960
I mean, Gran, too, but just
not as bad as Mary, you know.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.546
This one time, Mary went out for a while.

01:47.756 --> 01:49.116
And the minute she's out the door,

01:49.299 --> 01:50.966
Gran whips out the old Monopoly board.

01:51.176 --> 01:52.801
Not a word to Mary, she says.

01:53.762 --> 01:56.680
That was the best game of
Monopoly I've ever played.

01:56.890 --> 01:59.141
Like me and Gran were doing
something really naughty.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.350
Really wrong.

02:00.393 --> 02:02.478
Fire and brimstone stuff, you know.

02:05.857 --> 02:07.483
Some people may think that
those days with Gran and Mary

02:07.692 --> 02:09.776
had a bad influence on me.

02:10.652 --> 02:11.695
Could be right.

02:11.905 --> 02:14.531
After all, I still play footy.

02:14.741 --> 02:16.950
- Stick your friggin' shoulder in his ass!

02:18.536 --> 02:19.536
- Watch it.

02:19.662 --> 02:21.538
- Only doing what he wants.

02:24.751 --> 02:25.834
- Easy!

02:31.758 --> 02:33.759
♫ Now you're heading down to get someone ♫

02:33.968 --> 02:34.510
- Jesus, you blokes!

02:34.719 --> 02:35.260
What do you think you're doing?

02:35.470 --> 02:36.470
Come on.

02:37.639 --> 02:38.719
Oh, go on, get out of here.

02:38.848 --> 02:39.598
Go on.

02:39.808 --> 02:43.060
♫ All the people that you're standing on

02:43.269 --> 02:45.938
♫ All the people that you're standing on

02:46.147 --> 02:48.732
♫ Now you're heading down to be someone

02:48.942 --> 02:51.819
♫ Someone that you've seen in a magazine

02:52.028 --> 02:54.404
♫ Your preminition is coming true

02:54.614 --> 02:57.115
♫ Oh baby you're not so green

02:57.325 --> 02:59.993
♫ No baby you're not so green

03:00.203 --> 03:05.082
♫ No baby not so systematically
waking up the dead

03:07.460 --> 03:12.422
♫ Systematically stepping on my head

03:12.882 --> 03:17.845
♫ You're systematically waking up the dead

03:18.721 --> 03:23.475
♫ Systematically stepping on my head

03:24.143 --> 03:26.854
♫ Now you're heading
down to find something

03:27.063 --> 03:29.648
♫ Something that you
buried in your backyard

03:29.858 --> 03:32.943
♫ Position is coming through all the dirt

03:33.152 --> 03:35.028
♫ That you're diggin' on

03:35.238 --> 03:37.823
♫ All the dirt that you're diggin' on

03:38.032 --> 03:39.672
♫ Now you're heading down to be someone ♫

03:39.826 --> 03:40.826
- G'day, mate.

03:45.874 --> 03:48.333
- You're a woman of the world, Gert.

03:48.543 --> 03:50.085
What do you reckon?

03:50.795 --> 03:53.630
- Are you thinking of
getting hitched again, Harry?

03:55.300 --> 03:56.341
- Just looking.

03:56.551 --> 03:59.428
♫ Systematic waking up the dead.

03:59.637 --> 04:04.516
♫ Systematically stepping on my head

04:04.851 --> 04:09.813
♫ Systematically waking up the dead.

04:10.481 --> 04:15.360
♫ Systematically stepping on my head ♫

04:28.458 --> 04:30.834
♫ Now you're heading down to get someone

04:31.044 --> 04:33.629
♫ Someone that you
should have had years ago

04:33.838 --> 04:37.049
♫ Possession is coming
through all the people

04:37.258 --> 04:39.134
♫ That you're standing on

04:39.344 --> 04:41.887
♫ All the people that you're standing on

04:42.096 --> 04:44.598
♫ All the people that you're standing on

04:44.807 --> 04:46.433
♫ Are hard to get a hand on

04:46.643 --> 04:51.521
♫ Systematically waking up the dead

04:51.981 --> 04:56.944
♫ Systematically stepping on my head

04:57.654 --> 05:02.616
♫ Systematically waking up the dead

05:03.201 --> 05:07.537
♫ You're systematically
stepping on my head ♫

05:20.301 --> 05:21.009
- I'm fucked.

05:21.219 --> 05:22.761
- What was that?

05:22.971 --> 05:24.888
- I said I'm rooted.

05:27.016 --> 05:28.642
- Stopped off for a quickie
on the way home, did you?

05:28.851 --> 05:30.852
- God, you're off
sometimes, you know that?

05:31.062 --> 05:33.730
Put a dirty meaning on everything.

05:38.027 --> 05:39.027
Not lasagna again?

05:39.112 --> 05:40.472
Are you going senile or something?

05:40.530 --> 05:41.822
- Mashed potatoes and veggies.

05:42.031 --> 05:45.367
- We've had it three
times this week, already.

05:45.576 --> 05:47.056
Why can't we have a nice leg of lamb?

05:47.078 --> 05:48.787
We haven't had a roast for yonks.

05:48.997 --> 05:49.621
- Things aren't so wonderful when

05:49.831 --> 05:51.373
you're cooking, you know.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.458
Sausages and chips are a real treat,

05:53.668 --> 05:55.043
when you're in the kitchen.

05:55.253 --> 05:56.933
- I did that nice chicken curry last week.

05:57.088 --> 05:59.256
- So hot it blew the roof of my mouth off.

05:59.465 --> 06:00.424
- Oh, I'm sorry if you
can't stand a little

06:00.633 --> 06:01.673
imagination in my cooking.

06:01.676 --> 06:03.760
I'll stick to frozen lasagna, from now on.

06:04.387 --> 06:05.762
How long is it gonna be, anyway?

06:05.972 --> 06:06.972
- Nearly ready.

06:07.181 --> 06:08.640
- I'll just grab a quick shower.

06:08.850 --> 06:10.767
- Why do you always
decide to take a shower,

06:10.977 --> 06:12.185
just as I'm about to dish up?

06:12.395 --> 06:13.854
Just as I'm about to put
the food on the table...

06:14.063 --> 06:15.272
- You don't expect to sit down all sweaty,

06:15.481 --> 06:15.897
and smelly like this...

06:16.107 --> 06:16.565
- Why not?

06:16.774 --> 06:17.854
Doesn't usually bother you,

06:17.900 --> 06:19.234
unless you're going out.

06:20.028 --> 06:21.570
Are you going out?

06:21.779 --> 06:22.571
- Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

06:22.780 --> 06:23.613
I thought I'd just pop down to the pub,

06:23.823 --> 06:24.406
for a couple of beers.

06:24.615 --> 06:25.240
All right?

06:25.450 --> 06:26.450
- Got a date?

06:26.617 --> 06:27.909
- Can't a bloke go out for
a drink on a Friday night,

06:28.119 --> 06:29.703
without you making a
lifetime romance out of it?

06:29.912 --> 06:30.328
You dish up.

06:30.538 --> 06:32.122
I won't be two ticks, all right?

06:33.958 --> 06:35.459
- He'll be back in a minute.

06:51.434 --> 06:53.310
- You had a shower then, did you, Dad?

06:53.936 --> 06:55.979
- Yes, yes I did.

06:57.023 --> 06:58.774
- You didn't turn the
taps right off, again.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.525
- Is that right, son?

07:00.735 --> 07:03.779
- Every time I go for a
shower, the taps are dripping.

07:03.988 --> 07:04.988
Now, I know you don't turn them
right off because you think,

07:05.198 --> 07:05.947
you're saving the washers.

07:06.157 --> 07:09.242
But mate, I've told ya,
that's what they're for.

07:09.452 --> 07:09.910
And I'm a plumber.

07:10.119 --> 07:10.619
I can change 'em.

07:10.828 --> 07:12.412
And a few flamin' washers
are a damn sight cheaper,

07:12.622 --> 07:13.121
than the water rates.

07:13.331 --> 07:13.955
It drives me mental, Dad.

07:14.165 --> 07:14.748
You know, it does.

07:14.957 --> 07:16.208
If I've asked you once, I've
asked you thousand times.

07:16.417 --> 07:18.043
Turn the fucking taps off!

07:19.087 --> 07:20.378
- Yes.

07:20.588 --> 07:20.962
- Thanks.

07:21.172 --> 07:21.838
- Sorry.

07:22.048 --> 07:23.048
- Very much.

07:23.049 --> 07:24.466
- I will try.

07:27.595 --> 07:29.304
He's very wrought up.

07:29.514 --> 07:31.556
He only ever mentions
that when he's wrought up.

07:34.852 --> 07:36.895
He must think he's meeting
Mr. Right, tonight.

07:37.105 --> 07:39.356
He won't be eating any Sara Lee.

07:44.195 --> 07:45.987
You're probably wondering about that.

07:46.197 --> 07:48.532
About him meeting Mr. Right.

07:49.158 --> 07:51.243
Well, might as well get
it out into the open,

07:51.410 --> 07:53.578
as the actress said to the bishop.

07:54.664 --> 07:56.373
He won't be meeting any girl tonight.

07:56.582 --> 07:59.084
He's what you might call cheerful.

08:00.086 --> 08:02.129
Can't bear that other word.

08:03.673 --> 08:05.006
Some of you will be going,

08:05.216 --> 08:07.551
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, probably.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.553
Can't see why, though.

08:09.762 --> 08:10.971
He's a good, honest lad, with a heart

08:11.180 --> 08:12.514
as big as Western Australia.

08:12.723 --> 08:15.267
And he's as much a friend as he is a son.

08:15.476 --> 08:16.893
He's a good mate.

08:17.103 --> 08:20.105
Mind you, he can be a
nightmare to live with.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.985
Come on, your dinner's on the table.

08:25.194 --> 08:26.486
- You didn't do the laundry.

08:26.696 --> 08:27.696
- Sorry, I forgot.

08:27.738 --> 08:28.938
- Well I need a pair of socks.

08:28.990 --> 08:30.323
I can't go bloody barefoot.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.033
- Well, whiz down to the shop and buy

08:32.243 --> 08:33.618
yourself a pair of pantyhose.

08:33.828 --> 08:34.369
- Ha, ha, ha.

08:34.578 --> 08:35.578
Very funny.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.039
Suppose I could wash a pair of
mine and dry 'em in the oven.

08:38.249 --> 08:40.332
- Oh yeah, and the house
will reek of burnt nylon,

08:40.543 --> 08:41.543
like it did last time.

08:41.626 --> 08:42.626
Come and eat your dinner.

08:42.837 --> 08:44.296
- Yeah, yeah, two ticks.

08:47.717 --> 08:49.551
- I wouldn't want you getting
the wrong idea, though.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.178
Two blokes living alone together.

08:51.387 --> 08:52.387
It's only him.

08:52.555 --> 08:54.931
I'm not that way inclined.

08:55.141 --> 08:56.349
Regular lady's man, me.

08:56.559 --> 08:58.351
Always have been.

08:58.561 --> 09:02.147
When I was his age, I was
a right little rooter.

09:02.356 --> 09:03.899
Rabbit, they called me.

09:06.777 --> 09:08.862
'Till I met his mum, that is.

09:09.071 --> 09:10.471
No more fooling around, after that.

09:11.657 --> 09:14.409
I was faithful to her
from the day I met her.

09:14.619 --> 09:18.538
Because I knew I was
one of the lucky ones.

09:18.748 --> 09:20.832
I knew it was love.

09:24.629 --> 09:26.963
- These jeans all right, or
should I wear the white ones?

09:27.173 --> 09:28.632
- How many pairs of my
socks did you borrow?

09:28.841 --> 09:30.300
I can almost see your religion.

09:30.509 --> 09:32.719
- Yeah, well, if you've got it, show it.

09:32.929 --> 09:34.489
- Haven't got that much to skite about.

09:34.555 --> 09:36.097
- Well, Harry, size isn't everything!

09:36.307 --> 09:38.558
It's what you do with it that counts.

09:38.768 --> 09:41.353
- His mum always said that to me.

09:42.688 --> 09:43.688
What's that for?

09:43.856 --> 09:45.273
That's not spaghetti, you know.

09:45.483 --> 09:46.963
- Don't wanna get my new shirt dirty.

09:47.068 --> 09:49.277
- Have you actually met this young man?

09:49.487 --> 09:51.738
Or is there some young fella
wandering around Sydney,

09:51.948 --> 09:54.108
who doesn't know you're about
to happen to him tonight?

09:54.200 --> 09:55.960
- We've said g'day a
few times, down the pub.

09:56.077 --> 09:56.826
Ah!

09:57.036 --> 09:58.036
Courting?

09:58.120 --> 09:59.412
- No, Dad, not yet.

09:59.622 --> 10:01.998
But you never know your
luck in a big city, though.

10:07.296 --> 10:08.976
- Are you sure about this, Mum?

10:09.090 --> 10:12.092
- No, Jenny, I'm not sure at all.

10:12.301 --> 10:13.426
- Do you want me to come in with you?

10:13.636 --> 10:14.761
- No.

10:15.638 --> 10:19.224
This is something I've got to do.

10:19.433 --> 10:20.433
Now.

10:20.434 --> 10:21.434
Hmm!

10:23.813 --> 10:24.896
Wish me luck.

10:40.329 --> 10:42.414
- Now just relax, Mrs. Johnson.

10:42.623 --> 10:43.164
- Hmm!

10:43.374 --> 10:45.125
- I'm going to show you several faces.

10:45.334 --> 10:47.752
Now, I want you to just let them drift by,

10:47.962 --> 10:49.921
but if you see one that catches your eye,

10:50.131 --> 10:52.257
we can go back and have a second look.

10:52.466 --> 10:55.176
- Oh, my God, sorry.

10:55.386 --> 10:56.594
I'm a bit nervous.

10:56.804 --> 10:58.847
- Oh, no need to be, dear.

10:59.056 --> 11:01.433
You know, you've just
taken your first step,

11:01.642 --> 11:04.561
towards finding your perfect partner.

11:04.770 --> 11:06.104
Have a look.

11:08.399 --> 11:09.899
- Oh!

11:17.116 --> 11:18.575
Mmm.

11:22.121 --> 11:23.955
Hmm!

11:27.501 --> 11:28.501
- Yes.

11:28.711 --> 11:30.754
I'll give the party a call.

11:30.963 --> 11:32.547
Right, yes.

11:32.757 --> 11:33.757
Thanks very much.

11:33.799 --> 11:34.883
- You eating, or what?

11:36.719 --> 11:38.303
Who was that?

11:38.846 --> 11:40.180
- Man about a dog.

11:40.389 --> 11:41.973
- What bloody dog?

11:45.269 --> 11:46.749
- There's tomato sauce on it already.

11:46.896 --> 11:47.437
Yeah, I know.

11:47.646 --> 11:48.980
It needs more.

11:56.447 --> 11:57.489
- Of course, some people
think it isn't very

11:57.698 --> 12:00.033
good manners to read at the dinner table.

12:00.242 --> 12:02.786
- Some people haven't lived
with you for twenty odd years.

12:02.995 --> 12:05.497
- Some people should be so bloody lucky.

12:12.671 --> 12:14.589
- You should read a few
more books, you know.

12:14.799 --> 12:15.799
- Mmm?

12:15.800 --> 12:18.468
- There's a lot more to life
than what you see on telly.

12:19.345 --> 12:23.348
Like this bloke, Sir Richard Burton.

12:23.557 --> 12:26.684
One of the greatest
explorers that ever lived.

12:27.812 --> 12:31.147
First white man to see
the sacred stone at Mecca.

12:31.357 --> 12:33.858
And the first man to discover the lakes,

12:34.068 --> 12:36.611
in Africa, that are
the source of the Nile.

12:36.821 --> 12:37.404
A man-

12:37.613 --> 12:39.322
- I thought he married Elizabeth Taylor.

12:39.532 --> 12:41.332
- Who could take on the
world, and conquer it.

12:41.492 --> 12:42.532
- Yeah, a couple of times.

12:42.618 --> 12:44.452
- Not afraid of anything.

12:44.662 --> 12:47.414
You should read it, you
might pick up a few hints.

12:47.623 --> 12:48.623
- What for?

12:48.749 --> 12:50.469
I do not want to go
chasing all over Africa,

12:50.543 --> 12:52.544
looking for a place to have a swim.

12:53.712 --> 12:55.130
Anyway, the whole world has
already been discovered.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.339
- No, it hasn't.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.380
- Which bit's are missing?

12:57.466 --> 12:58.591
- There's amazing things waiting for

12:58.801 --> 12:59.884
you just around the corner.

13:00.094 --> 13:01.469
Wonderful things, like love.

13:01.679 --> 13:03.513
The greatest adventure of all.

13:03.722 --> 13:04.931
Your grandmother said it once.

13:05.141 --> 13:07.016
I'll never forget it.

13:07.226 --> 13:09.727
The greatest explorers, she said,

13:09.937 --> 13:12.605
are the explorers of the human heart.

13:13.232 --> 13:15.400
- Is that why she became a dyke?

13:15.609 --> 13:17.569
- Your grandmother was not a dyke!

13:17.778 --> 13:19.320
- She was licking Aunt
Mary's pussy for 40 years.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.072
What else do you call it?

13:23.576 --> 13:28.496
- I admit her relationship
with Mary was, intimate.

13:30.666 --> 13:32.792
But she was not a dyke.

13:34.837 --> 13:37.130
Lesbian, perhaps.

13:38.215 --> 13:39.841
- Lezzo, dyke, what's the diff?

13:40.050 --> 13:41.050
- What's the diff?

13:41.135 --> 13:42.218
What's the diff?

13:42.428 --> 13:44.971
There's a whole lot of flaming diff.

13:45.181 --> 13:47.807
Your grandmother was a
very beautiful woman.

13:48.017 --> 13:49.809
And just because she found happiness

13:50.019 --> 13:51.603
after your grandfather had died,

13:51.812 --> 13:55.273
just because, in her
grief, she turned to Mary,

13:55.483 --> 13:57.942
and the of them found
comfort in each other's arms,

13:58.152 --> 14:01.070
doesn't give you the
right to call her names.

14:01.822 --> 14:03.907
How would you like it if
I went around calling you

14:04.116 --> 14:05.950
pansy, fairy, poofter?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.744
- You do, half the time.

14:07.953 --> 14:10.538
- Only when I'm annoyed with you.

14:11.165 --> 14:12.457
Now eat your veggies.

14:12.666 --> 14:13.791
- No, I've had it.

14:14.001 --> 14:15.210
I've done my dash.

14:15.419 --> 14:16.669
- Now, you know...

14:18.756 --> 14:20.298
You know how you get angry with me,

14:20.508 --> 14:21.799
when I don't turn the
taps off in the shower?

14:22.009 --> 14:22.675
- Look, I'm sorry.

14:22.885 --> 14:24.427
- No, no, no, no, don't apologise.

14:24.637 --> 14:25.803
Listen, listen.

14:26.013 --> 14:29.307
Every time you finish a meal, you always

14:29.517 --> 14:30.808
push your plate away from you.

14:31.018 --> 14:32.018
Always.

14:32.186 --> 14:33.626
Now, I've told you until I'm blue in

14:33.646 --> 14:35.688
the face, but you always do it.

14:35.898 --> 14:36.814
It doesn't matter where we are.

14:37.024 --> 14:39.817
Here, out, Buckingham
Palace, for all you care.

14:40.027 --> 14:42.487
You'd bloody do it there,
and it drives me mental!

14:44.406 --> 14:46.115
- If that's how you feel.

14:51.622 --> 14:53.373
- That's how I feel.

14:54.917 --> 14:56.237
There's a Sara Lee in the fridge.

14:56.418 --> 14:58.086
- Mmm-mmm, no thanks, mate.

14:58.295 --> 14:59.837
Don't wanna go breaking out in zits.

15:00.047 --> 15:02.465
Fact is, I'm running late as it is.

15:04.051 --> 15:06.344
- Bit early, isn't it?

15:06.554 --> 15:08.930
- Well, you know what they
say about the early bird.

15:09.139 --> 15:10.640
- Yes, but I don't think
that's the sort of worm

15:10.849 --> 15:12.600
they had in mind when they said it.

15:13.686 --> 15:15.603
Ah, leave the dishes, I'll do them.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.146
- Ta, Dad.

15:17.690 --> 15:19.524
I'll just, uh, clean my teeth.

15:22.987 --> 15:23.987
- See what I mean?

15:24.196 --> 15:26.531
He hasn't been this excited for ages.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.866
This one must be quite something.

15:37.876 --> 15:39.210
- Your dinner's nearly cold.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.420
- Sorry.

15:40.921 --> 15:42.005
- It'd be nice if you showed some respect

15:42.214 --> 15:43.673
for your mother's cooking.

15:43.966 --> 15:45.550
Someone has to.

15:45.759 --> 15:47.510
- I'll grab something at the pub.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.012
- Going out again, are we?

15:49.221 --> 15:51.598
Be nice if you spent some
time at home, occasionally.

15:51.807 --> 15:53.641
- It's Friday night, for Pete's sake.

15:53.851 --> 15:56.352
- You smell like a Bombay brothel, too.

15:56.562 --> 15:58.402
- Good stuff that, Dad.
Obsession, it's called.

15:58.522 --> 15:59.522
It costs a fortune.

15:59.732 --> 16:00.898
- So, where are you going?

16:01.108 --> 16:02.483
Dancing?

16:02.693 --> 16:04.444
- You never bloody let up, do you?

16:04.653 --> 16:06.738
I took dancing lessons to
meet people, that's all.

16:06.947 --> 16:08.948
Wasn't as if it was ballet or anything.

16:09.158 --> 16:10.908
- I only asked where you were going.

16:11.118 --> 16:13.911
And you watch your tongue
in front of your mother.

16:14.121 --> 16:16.748
- Sorry, Mum. I'll see you later.

16:16.957 --> 16:17.999
- Be good, dear.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.251
Have a nice time.

16:20.753 --> 16:23.004
- And if you can't be good, be careful.

16:24.381 --> 16:27.175
See? I do try.

16:28.010 --> 16:29.427
- No, you don't.

16:29.637 --> 16:31.429
You don't really try.

16:31.639 --> 16:33.264
You never give him an inch.

16:44.026 --> 16:46.194
- I was surprised by the
number of products I had in my

16:46.403 --> 16:48.696
kitchen cupboard that were unfriendly.

16:48.906 --> 16:50.615
And also so surprised how harmful they

16:50.824 --> 16:55.453
were the ones that I did have.

16:55.663 --> 16:57.413
- You, um.

16:58.999 --> 17:00.333
You don't feel like going out?

17:00.542 --> 17:03.169
- There's a film on telly.

17:03.379 --> 17:05.380
Don't worry, I'll watch it in my room.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.714
Coast will be clear.

17:06.924 --> 17:07.924
- That's all right then.

17:07.965 --> 17:09.050
How do I look?

17:09.259 --> 17:10.510
God's gift?

17:10.719 --> 17:13.012
- Did you use a whole
bottle of aftershave?

17:13.222 --> 17:15.598
- Bit fierce, is it? Obsession.

17:15.808 --> 17:17.058
He said it was his favorite.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.394
- Probably quite nice,

17:19.603 --> 17:22.438
in moderation.

17:27.528 --> 17:28.568
Where are you meeting him?

17:28.737 --> 17:29.737
At the Prinny?

17:29.822 --> 17:31.406
- Yep. That's if he shows up.

17:31.615 --> 17:32.448
- I thought you had a date.

17:32.658 --> 17:34.826
- Yeah, well, but, you
know, knowing my luck.

17:35.035 --> 17:36.536
- There's plenty of others.

17:36.745 --> 17:38.246
- No, Dad, this is different.

17:38.455 --> 17:40.998
He's, um, something else.

17:41.625 --> 17:42.917
Nice.

17:44.128 --> 17:46.254
- I expect he'll turn up then.

17:46.463 --> 17:47.922
- I hope so.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.342
- You've gotta have a bit
more faith in yourself, Jeff.

17:51.552 --> 17:52.593
If you were my son's friend, you know,

17:52.803 --> 17:54.262
I'd be pleased it was you.

17:54.471 --> 17:55.430
- Things don't always work out like that

17:55.639 --> 17:57.265
in the real world, Dad.

17:57.474 --> 17:58.516
- You better not keep him waiting.

17:58.726 --> 17:59.267
- Too right

17:59.476 --> 17:59.892
- Cop ya.

18:00.102 --> 18:01.644
- Later

18:03.439 --> 18:04.021
- Have fun.

18:04.231 --> 18:05.440
- Thanks, mate.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.358
Do my best.

18:08.527 --> 18:11.112
- He's 24 years old, and he's no virgin,

18:11.321 --> 18:13.072
that's a sure and certain fact.

18:13.907 --> 18:16.451
But he's carrying on like
it was his first ever date.

18:16.827 --> 18:18.786
You might have noticed that he lacks a bit

18:18.996 --> 18:20.329
of confidence in himself,

18:20.539 --> 18:22.123
in the romantic stakes.

18:22.332 --> 18:23.916
I can't see why. I mean,

18:24.126 --> 18:26.169
he's a nice enough looking lad,

18:26.378 --> 18:28.421
if you like that sort of thing.

18:28.630 --> 18:31.299
But, uh, about 3 years
ago, a terrible thing

18:31.508 --> 18:32.049
happened to him.

18:32.259 --> 18:34.886
He fell in love.

18:35.095 --> 18:36.721
It didn't last that long.

18:36.930 --> 18:39.724
The other bloke, uh,

18:39.933 --> 18:42.477
Kevin, I think it was, oh,
he was a nice enough lad,

18:42.686 --> 18:43.895
but a bit flighty.

18:44.104 --> 18:46.147
Training to be a Qantas
steward or something.

18:46.732 --> 18:49.275
And after about three months,

18:49.485 --> 18:52.945
he just moved on to greener pastures, and,

18:53.781 --> 18:56.199
it just about broke Jeff's heart.

18:59.912 --> 19:03.080
- It's true. Grandma was a dyke.

19:03.791 --> 19:06.292
Well, lesbian.

19:07.377 --> 19:09.697
I used to go and stay down
there for my holidays, you know.

19:09.755 --> 19:11.464
They were the best times.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.840
Just a little brick-and-tile
down by the Hawkesbury.

19:14.843 --> 19:17.970
Nothing flash, but clean.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.180
Gran was always polishing every bit

19:19.389 --> 19:20.848
of woodwork in the house.

19:21.058 --> 19:22.058
So you'd get up in the
morning and there'd be

19:22.267 --> 19:23.392
this wonderful smell of lavender floor

19:23.602 --> 19:24.682
polish, all over the place.

19:24.770 --> 19:26.437
- Good night.

19:26.939 --> 19:29.440
- That reminds me of a funny story.

19:29.983 --> 19:32.026
Suppose it's a bit off.

19:33.737 --> 19:34.946
I was there, once.

19:35.155 --> 19:37.031
Some of my cousins were staying, too.

19:37.241 --> 19:38.115
So I had to sleep in the spare bed

19:38.325 --> 19:39.784
in Gran's room, you know.

19:41.203 --> 19:42.870
I remember, I could see it so clearly.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.414
Waking up that first morning,

19:45.624 --> 19:47.458
Looking across to Gran's
big old double bed,

19:48.961 --> 19:51.087
And there were Gran and Mary.

19:51.672 --> 19:53.714
Tucked up in bed, wrapped
up in each other's arms.

19:54.591 --> 19:57.093
Gran was snoring, I remember.

19:58.095 --> 20:00.596
I lay there looking at
them for such a long time.

20:02.099 --> 20:05.101
Just looked natural somehow, you know?

20:06.520 --> 20:08.771
Like the most natural thing I'd ever seen.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.693
Like love.

20:23.579 --> 20:24.287
- Hello?

20:24.496 --> 20:26.163
- Joyce Johnson?

20:26.874 --> 20:28.332
- No. No, I'll Just get her.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.418
Mum, it's for you.

20:36.508 --> 20:37.091
- Hello?

20:37.301 --> 20:39.427
- Ah, look, you don't know me, um,

20:39.636 --> 20:41.387
but my name's Harry Mitchell,

20:41.597 --> 20:43.264
and I got your name from
Desiree's Introduction Agency.

20:43.473 --> 20:46.392
- Oh, yeah. Mr. Mitchell,

20:47.144 --> 20:48.269
Pleased to meet you.

20:48.478 --> 20:50.021
- Please. Call me Harry.

20:50.230 --> 20:52.857
- Of course. I'm sorry. Harry.

20:53.859 --> 20:54.525
But...

20:54.735 --> 20:56.652
Look, it's all right...

20:56.862 --> 20:58.696
- It's the first time I've
done this sort of thing, too.

20:58.906 --> 21:00.615
- Oh, you mean, um, you don't use

21:00.824 --> 21:02.325
Desiree's on a regular basis?

21:02.534 --> 21:03.993
- No.

21:04.202 --> 21:05.244
No, nothing like that.

21:05.454 --> 21:06.454
Um...

21:06.663 --> 21:10.207
No, I'm interested in
a serious relationship,

21:10.417 --> 21:13.961
and the most important thing
to me is companionship.

21:14.171 --> 21:16.797
Uh, I was thinking that we
should, uh, meet, have a meal,

21:17.007 --> 21:19.592
you know, somewhere, uh, quiet, classy.

21:19.801 --> 21:23.930
I happen to be a member of
the Rozelle Leagues Club.

21:24.139 --> 21:26.515
- Isn't that a bit rowdy?

21:26.725 --> 21:28.684
Well, they, um, you know, have a very nice

21:28.894 --> 21:31.354
dining room, actually,
and there's dancing.

21:31.563 --> 21:32.563
Proper dancing.

21:32.648 --> 21:34.231
Well, but if, you know, you'd prefer a

21:34.441 --> 21:36.317
movie or races or whatever...

21:36.526 --> 21:40.279
- No, no, no, no. I'd like
to have dinner at your club.

21:40.489 --> 21:40.988
- You would?

21:41.198 --> 21:41.781
- Mmm.

21:41.990 --> 21:45.242
- Oh, that's very nice, Joyce.

21:45.452 --> 21:47.119
Well, then I'll pick you up on Saturday,

21:47.329 --> 21:49.038
say half past 12?

21:49.247 --> 21:52.375
- Yeah. Or I could meet you
there, if you like, Harry?

21:52.584 --> 21:54.377
- No, no, no, no. It would be my pleasure.

21:54.586 --> 21:57.421
Um, I'm looking forward to it, I promise.

21:57.631 --> 21:58.631
- Me, too.

21:58.674 --> 22:01.133
- So, 'till Saturday, then.

22:01.343 --> 22:02.468
- Bye.

22:02.678 --> 22:04.595
- Bye, then.

22:55.731 --> 22:56.731
- G'day, Baxter.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.691
- Hi, George.

23:04.740 --> 23:07.533
That's better. Couldn't
hear myself think in there.

23:08.160 --> 23:08.743
Cheers.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.453
- Yeah, cheers.

23:13.957 --> 23:14.957
Baxter?

23:15.167 --> 23:17.001
- Oh, it's a joke. The
footy team, you know.

23:17.210 --> 23:20.838
Backs to the wall, boys, here comes Jeff.

23:21.048 --> 23:23.924
- So, you play footy.

23:24.134 --> 23:25.551
- Just the local pub, just amateur.

23:25.761 --> 23:26.969
Bit of a laugh.

23:27.179 --> 23:30.139
- Well, it's more than a
laugh, from what I've heard.

23:30.348 --> 23:31.849
What goes on in those locker rooms?

23:32.059 --> 23:34.351
- Oh, well, it's a
man's world, mate.

23:34.561 --> 23:35.394
It's all spit on the floor,

23:35.604 --> 23:38.147
and, how many sheilas
did you root last night?

23:39.066 --> 23:40.608
Do you play any sport?

23:40.817 --> 23:41.984
- Yeah, swimming.

23:42.194 --> 23:43.611
I do a lot of swimming.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.072
Keeps me away from home a fair
bit, I suppose that's why.

23:46.281 --> 23:48.616
All by yourself, in the water,

23:48.825 --> 23:51.702
no one to hassle you, give
you a hard time, you know.

23:51.912 --> 23:54.789
Won a few medals, too, at school.

23:59.127 --> 24:02.797
- Wouldn't mind seeing
you in your Speedos!

24:05.258 --> 24:08.427
- I'll show you later. Got 'em on now.

24:11.264 --> 24:13.724
If you wear your footy shorts...

24:14.851 --> 24:16.185
- You're on.

24:30.909 --> 24:31.742
I really liked you from the first time

24:31.952 --> 24:32.993
I saw you down the pub.

24:34.121 --> 24:36.831
It took me yonks to pluck up
the courage to even say g'day.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.250
- I thought you weren't
interested, you know.

24:39.459 --> 24:41.669
Like, I've seen you,
too, and in the park.

24:41.878 --> 24:43.379
I work in the park.

24:43.588 --> 24:46.966
And I've seen you there, jogging,

24:47.300 --> 24:49.301
in that footy gear.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.389
Those shorts look really sexy on you.

24:57.561 --> 25:00.104
- What you said before,
about, about, home,

25:00.313 --> 25:01.814
don't you get on, at home?

25:02.023 --> 25:06.360
- Oh, Mum's all right, but
Dad's a bit tricky, you know.

25:06.570 --> 25:08.320
He's always picking on me,

25:08.530 --> 25:10.573
finding fault with everything I do.

25:10.782 --> 25:13.284
He went through the
roof when I got my job.

25:13.493 --> 25:16.120
- Gardening? What's wrong with that?

25:16.329 --> 25:19.874
He said it wasn't good enough
for me. No future in it.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.711
But I'm bringing home nearly
as much money as him, already.

25:25.839 --> 25:29.633
He's, I don't know, he's
like a stranger to me.

25:30.385 --> 25:33.554
Someone I live with, but don't...

25:34.514 --> 25:37.099
know very well, and, don't like very much.

25:38.602 --> 25:40.769
That's why I took up swimming.

25:43.315 --> 25:45.691
- Things are a little bit
different at our house.

25:57.495 --> 25:59.413
Do you wanna come home?

26:25.982 --> 26:28.275
- Just push it open.

26:32.864 --> 26:35.324
Make yourself comfy.

26:35.533 --> 26:36.533
Want a beer?

26:36.660 --> 26:38.577
- Where's...

26:39.704 --> 26:41.413
Is your dad out?

26:41.623 --> 26:44.541
- He'll be in bed.

26:44.751 --> 26:46.502
- Well, shouldn't we be a bit quiet then?

26:46.711 --> 26:47.711
- What for?

26:47.712 --> 26:48.712
- In case we wake him up.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.048
- Ha! He won't be asleep. Not yet.

26:51.258 --> 26:53.300
Probably come and say G'day.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.552
I told you, he knows all about me,

26:55.762 --> 26:58.013
what I do and who I do it with.

26:58.223 --> 27:00.724
I bring blokes back all the time.

27:01.643 --> 27:05.980
Not that there's that many,
I mean. I should be so lucky.

27:06.189 --> 27:07.523
What I'm trying to say is that Dad knows,

27:07.732 --> 27:09.817
and he doesn't care.

27:10.026 --> 27:11.986
- Well, if you're sure.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.072
- Scout's honor..

27:15.282 --> 27:17.533
If they've got any left.

27:18.451 --> 27:19.785
Come on.

27:21.663 --> 27:22.955
Sit down.

27:23.915 --> 27:25.291
Relax.

27:30.588 --> 27:33.549
That's better. Cheers.

27:33.758 --> 27:35.968
- Yeah, cheers.

27:40.682 --> 27:42.891
- I'm really glad you showed up.

27:45.645 --> 27:48.897
- So, what about the other
teams? The football teams.

27:49.566 --> 27:51.775
- You're just an old
footy perv, aren't you?

27:51.985 --> 27:53.193
- Uh-huh.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.487
- Just 'cause they're
big, butch footballers,

27:55.697 --> 27:58.615
doesn't mean they're
Superman, in bed, you know.

27:59.117 --> 28:01.118
Every year, the team goes to Manila,

28:01.328 --> 28:03.662
for the, you know, post-season holiday.

28:03.872 --> 28:05.789
And every year, they end up in a brothel.

28:05.999 --> 28:08.375
We've got this one real
brick with ears, Jack Rhymer.

28:08.585 --> 28:10.127
First time, he was really shocked.

28:10.337 --> 28:11.170
He'd been with this Asian chick.

28:11.379 --> 28:12.963
She was all over him, you
know. Doing everything,

28:13.173 --> 28:14.840
like a Chinese gymnast.

28:15.508 --> 28:16.708
Jacko wasn't too keen on that.

28:16.801 --> 28:18.052
He said he kept wishing
he was with an Aussie girl

28:18.261 --> 28:20.512
who'd just lie there
like a soggy cornflake.

28:25.477 --> 28:26.977
- Um...

28:28.229 --> 28:30.064
What do you like?

28:33.026 --> 28:37.529
- Well, I don't know as I'd
win any gold medals, but...

28:38.573 --> 28:40.866
I like a bit of action.

28:42.535 --> 28:44.661
- So do I.

29:01.054 --> 29:03.555
- Don't let me interrupt anything.

29:04.265 --> 29:05.974
- For crying out loud,
Dad, can't you ever knock?

29:06.184 --> 29:09.770
- I was just going to get
myself a beer. Anyone else?

29:09.979 --> 29:11.313
- No.

29:14.734 --> 29:16.485
- It's ok, I Promise you.

29:16.694 --> 29:17.974
- Relax, just carry on as usual.

29:18.154 --> 29:19.154
- But he saw us.

29:19.155 --> 29:20.989
- Fuck, he's seen worse than that.

29:21.199 --> 29:23.951
- A couple of years ago, I had
a friend who stayed the night.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.480
We were having a wake-up session.

29:25.662 --> 29:27.037
Dad brings the tea, right
in the middle of it.

29:27.247 --> 29:30.207
- Oh, what did he say?

29:30.417 --> 29:32.751
- Ah, he said, careful of the sheets.

29:32.961 --> 29:35.546
It broke the ice.

29:37.966 --> 29:40.259
- Well, aren't you going to introduce me?

29:40.468 --> 29:41.468
- Yes, sorry.

29:41.678 --> 29:42.553
This is Greg. Greg, this is my dad.

29:42.762 --> 29:45.097
- Very pleased to meet
you. You can call me Harry.

29:45.306 --> 29:47.474
Sit down.

29:48.143 --> 29:49.351
Come on.

29:49.561 --> 29:50.561
- Thanks.

29:50.687 --> 29:52.813
- Make yourself at home.

29:54.149 --> 29:56.024
- Um...

29:58.862 --> 30:00.529
- Well!

30:00.738 --> 30:02.406
Up your bum.

30:03.241 --> 30:05.868
- It's just a joke. Dad's
always making jokes.

30:06.077 --> 30:08.537
- Yeah, like that time with
the lavender floor polish...

30:08.746 --> 30:10.386
- Steady on Dad, it's a bit off, that is.

30:11.166 --> 30:12.291
- What was that about
lavender floor polish?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.876
- Don't worry about it,
you wouldn't be interested.

30:14.085 --> 30:16.628
It's just a misunderstanding.

30:17.255 --> 30:18.213
- What do you do for a crust, son?

30:18.423 --> 30:19.423
- He's a gardener, Dad.

30:19.507 --> 30:21.425
- Oh, yeah, deaf and dumb, is he, too?

30:21.634 --> 30:22.994
- I work at the Botanical Gardens.

30:23.178 --> 30:23.635
- Is that right?

30:23.845 --> 30:25.053
- Mmm-hmm.

30:25.263 --> 30:26.930
- Perhaps the young fellow
would like another drink.

30:27.140 --> 30:28.265
- Uh...

30:28.475 --> 30:29.183
- Want something stronger?

30:29.392 --> 30:30.559
- No. No. This is fine.

30:30.768 --> 30:34.563
- Got some scotch, maybe
a drop of brandy left.

30:34.772 --> 30:36.648
- Well, I wouldn't say
no to a drop of scotch.

30:36.858 --> 30:38.942
- You know what they say,
whisky makes you frisky.

30:39.152 --> 30:40.235
- Yeah, and, brandy makes you randy.

30:40.445 --> 30:43.197
- Hey, pity we haven't got any rum, eh?

30:43.406 --> 30:44.740
- That's a good one, I like that.

30:44.949 --> 30:45.365
- Ha.

30:45.575 --> 30:47.659
- I'll make it a double,
then. I'll just get the ice.

31:12.018 --> 31:14.353
- These are wonderful.

31:14.562 --> 31:17.064
- My pride and joy.

31:17.273 --> 31:20.025
Not as good as my brother Eric's.

31:20.235 --> 31:21.735
I don't know what he does.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.237
- Well, uh,

31:23.446 --> 31:26.698
You know what they say about tomatoes.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.951
Same as lemon trees.

31:32.956 --> 31:34.039
- Busy at the Prinny?

31:34.249 --> 31:36.542
- Uh, yeah, it was packed.

31:36.751 --> 31:39.378
- Nice pub.

31:39.587 --> 31:40.627
- What, you've been there?

31:40.630 --> 31:41.296
- Oh, yeah.

31:41.506 --> 31:43.465
Well, you know, when it
became obvious, that, uh,

31:43.675 --> 31:46.468
Jeff was, well, that way,

31:46.678 --> 31:49.763
I thought, well, "His
heart, his life," and, um,

31:49.973 --> 31:51.974
I'd never met any
willie-woofters, so, I...

31:52.183 --> 31:54.059
sorry, gay persons.

31:54.269 --> 31:55.978
Or none that I knew of, anyway.

31:56.187 --> 31:57.771
I thought, well I've gotta
find out what all this is about.

31:57.981 --> 31:59.481
So, uh...

31:59.899 --> 32:02.067
I got him to take me on a pub crawl.

32:02.277 --> 32:04.528
It started off at the Prinny.

32:04.737 --> 32:05.988
We had a great old time.

32:06.197 --> 32:09.741
I had no idea there was that many places.

32:09.951 --> 32:13.829
We ended up at the, The
Barracks, I think it was.

32:14.038 --> 32:16.665
I got talking to a couple
of blokes, you know,

32:16.874 --> 32:19.209
a bit Nancy, but a lot of fun, really.

32:19.419 --> 32:21.795
And, uh, and one of them, well,

32:22.005 --> 32:23.685
he must've thought I
was that way inclined.

32:23.715 --> 32:26.925
He asked me my name
and when I said, Harry,

32:27.135 --> 32:29.803
He said, oh no, that
doesn't suit you at all.

32:30.013 --> 32:32.556
You'll always be Harriet to me.

32:32.765 --> 32:35.559
Well, Harriets not a name
I've ever been fond of.

32:35.768 --> 32:37.644
So I said, Harriet? Never!

32:37.854 --> 32:40.731
Call me Henrietta.

32:42.275 --> 32:43.483
- Henrietta, eh?

32:43.693 --> 32:45.027
It doesn't really suit you.

32:45.236 --> 32:46.737
- Eh? You reckon?

32:46.946 --> 32:48.739
I thought it was pretty good myself.

32:48.948 --> 32:50.741
I mean, a bit refined, you know?

32:50.950 --> 32:53.535
- Cripes, I just can't imagine my dad

32:53.745 --> 32:56.288
ever doing something like that.

32:57.540 --> 33:01.543
What's that? What's that?

33:01.753 --> 33:05.047
You know, when I'm working, of course.

33:05.256 --> 33:07.090
What's that?

33:11.721 --> 33:13.055
- Cheers.

33:14.932 --> 33:17.225
- So you, uh, live at home, uh,

33:17.435 --> 33:18.518
- Greg.

33:18.728 --> 33:19.728
- Ah.

33:19.937 --> 33:21.980
Yeah. Worst luck.

33:22.482 --> 33:23.482
- And, uh...

33:24.275 --> 33:27.069
You don't get on with
your family then, Greg?

33:27.278 --> 33:27.653
- Well.

33:27.862 --> 33:29.738
- Greg's folks don't
know about him yet, Dad.

33:29.947 --> 33:31.782
- I see.

33:31.991 --> 33:34.534
Don't you think that's a shame, Greg?

33:34.744 --> 33:35.452
Leave it, Dad.

33:35.662 --> 33:37.746
- Oh, I've always been
very grateful for Jeff

33:37.955 --> 33:38.955
being honest with me.

33:39.082 --> 33:40.123
I mean, not that I had a lot of choice.

33:40.333 --> 33:41.124
Finding him in the back shed there

33:41.334 --> 33:43.126
when he was, what, 14, were you?

33:43.336 --> 33:45.016
You know, sticking it
up Willie Jones' bum.

33:45.046 --> 33:46.213
- I was not up his b...

33:46.422 --> 33:47.742
- Well, near as bloody damn it...

33:47.799 --> 33:48.757
- You are very broad-minded...

33:48.966 --> 33:50.050
- I try to be, mate.

33:50.259 --> 33:51.259
I have to be, you know.

33:51.386 --> 33:52.177
I mean, this is Jeff's home,

33:52.387 --> 33:55.931
and if he's unable to be
himself here, where can he be?

33:56.140 --> 34:00.602
And I want you to think of this
as your home, too, eh, Greg?

34:00.812 --> 34:03.939
You're welcome here any time you like.

34:04.148 --> 34:06.400
We don't have any secrets
from each other here.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.235
- Nothing on, uh, telly, Dad?

34:08.444 --> 34:09.735
- Nothing worth watching.

34:09.946 --> 34:11.446
This is much better, eh?

34:11.656 --> 34:13.407
- Well, uh,

34:13.616 --> 34:16.118
up your bum, Henrietta.

34:16.327 --> 34:18.120
- Up your dress, Griselda.

34:18.329 --> 34:19.996
- You two are well away, aren't ya?

34:20.206 --> 34:23.291
- Tell me, what's your ambition?

34:23.501 --> 34:25.043
You know, what's your dream?

34:25.253 --> 34:27.337
Apart from playing hide-the-sausage,

34:27.547 --> 34:28.588
with young Jeffrey here?

34:28.797 --> 34:32.007
I mean, what would you like to do in life?

34:32.510 --> 34:35.178
- My secret dream?

34:35.388 --> 34:38.473
My really, truly secret dream?

34:39.391 --> 34:41.726
Oh.

34:42.728 --> 34:46.440
- I'd, I'd like to
plant a forest, you know?

34:46.649 --> 34:48.608
To plant a whole forest.

34:48.818 --> 34:52.904
And watch it grow.

34:53.114 --> 34:54.474
And go out and stand in the middle

34:54.614 --> 34:57.909
of all these great trees, and say,

34:58.119 --> 35:01.121
I planted this, I made this.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.834
- That's magnificent.

35:06.043 --> 35:08.044
Do it.

35:08.254 --> 35:10.505
That's wonderful, don't you think, Jeff?

35:10.715 --> 35:13.425
- Bloody oath.

35:13.634 --> 35:16.511
Make a fair old swag of
violins, too, wouldn't it?

35:17.513 --> 35:20.348
- Make a fair old swag of violins, too.

35:20.558 --> 35:22.142
Don't you have any respect
for the English language?

35:22.351 --> 35:23.518
- What's wrong with the way I talk?

35:23.728 --> 35:25.729
- I like the way he talks.

35:25.938 --> 35:29.649
It's real manly. It turns me on.

35:32.570 --> 35:34.821
Uh, I'm sorry, Harry, that was a bit bold.

35:35.031 --> 35:37.449
- Please. Pretend I'm not here.

35:37.658 --> 35:40.869
- Yes, please.

35:41.078 --> 35:43.580
- Why don't you get the, uh,

35:43.790 --> 35:45.791
young fellow another whisky, Jeff?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.502
- No, no, really. I'm a two-pot screamer.

35:48.711 --> 35:51.671
- I'm a bit like that, myself.
Two, and I'm anybody's.

35:51.881 --> 35:53.131
- Three, and I'm everybody's.

35:53.341 --> 35:56.051
- Four, and I'm nobody's.

35:56.260 --> 35:59.721
- Actually, maybe I will have one more.

35:59.931 --> 36:01.640
I might do anything.

36:04.352 --> 36:06.353
- Feel free.

36:11.484 --> 36:14.027
- Nice place you got here, Harry.

36:21.077 --> 36:23.119
- I'm very pleased you like my boy, Gary.

36:23.329 --> 36:25.288
He, uh, doesn't push himself very much,

36:25.498 --> 36:26.540
you know, sometimes.

36:26.749 --> 36:29.835
But, uh, he's got a heart of gold.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.547
And he likes you.

36:34.090 --> 36:37.217
- Well, I think he's very nice.

36:37.426 --> 36:39.928
- But if you need anything to, uh,

36:40.137 --> 36:41.555
well, uh,

36:41.764 --> 36:44.015
He can be a bit of a lump.

36:44.225 --> 36:47.352
Uh, I've got these magazines,

36:47.562 --> 36:50.313
you know, if you need
anything to get started.

36:50.523 --> 36:52.357
- Um.

36:52.567 --> 36:53.687
Well, are, are these Jeff's?

36:53.734 --> 36:55.026
- Yeah.

36:55.236 --> 36:56.403
No, uh, i... I bought them.

36:56.612 --> 36:58.212
I just, uh, wanted to find out what sort

36:58.281 --> 36:58.905
of thing he got up to.

36:59.115 --> 37:01.116
I mean, I had a fair idea, uh, of course.

37:01.325 --> 37:04.578
But there's, uh, some,
uh, things in here, uh,

37:04.787 --> 37:06.107
that I would never have imagined.

37:06.289 --> 37:10.500
And this one, it's about safe sex.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.129
Oh, I was worried about
this terrible aids thing.

37:14.338 --> 37:15.505
I mean, who isn't these days?

37:15.715 --> 37:16.715
- Yeah.

37:17.258 --> 37:20.927
- And, uh, I just wanted to
find out if Jeff was safe.

37:21.470 --> 37:22.470
Um.

37:22.638 --> 37:25.682
Well, you know, it
worries me; he's my son.

37:25.892 --> 37:28.476
Um, ahem and, uh,

37:28.686 --> 37:30.228
So I thought I'd just
leave these lying around,

37:30.438 --> 37:32.022
like, so Jeff could find
out what it was about,

37:32.231 --> 37:33.431
but he told me that he knew...

37:33.566 --> 37:35.442
- It's all right Mr.
Mitchell. I mean, I do,

37:35.651 --> 37:36.818
do safe sex, too,

37:37.028 --> 37:38.028
If that's what you're worried about.

37:38.237 --> 37:39.237
- Hmm.

37:39.363 --> 37:42.240
Well, there you go, then, um,

37:42.450 --> 37:44.326
If you need a turn-on.

37:44.535 --> 37:46.786
Um, well, um, have a good time, won't you?

37:46.996 --> 37:48.079
- Thanks.

37:48.289 --> 37:50.540
- Yeah, I will get out of your way now.

37:50.750 --> 37:51.833
It's been very nice to meet you, Gary.

37:52.043 --> 37:54.336
You, too. Uh, Greg. You, too, Mr. Mitchell

37:57.590 --> 38:00.383
- Don't do anything I
wouldn't do, you two.

38:03.346 --> 38:06.765
- Can't believe he's gone.
Thought he'd never get the hint.

38:37.838 --> 38:40.215
- Sorry, Greg. I, uh, forgot to ask,

38:40.424 --> 38:41.591
how you take your tea in the morning.

38:41.801 --> 38:42.801
- As it comes.

38:42.802 --> 38:43.301
- White, with two?

38:43.511 --> 38:44.511
- Piss off, will ya?

38:44.595 --> 38:47.180
- Don't mind me. Good night, all.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.603
- He really does mean well.

38:59.902 --> 39:00.986
Where was I?

39:01.195 --> 39:03.738
- Look, uh,

39:04.240 --> 39:07.283
do you mind? I think I'll give it a miss.

39:13.290 --> 39:14.624
- Come on.

39:14.834 --> 39:15.583
It's still early.

39:15.793 --> 39:18.795
- No, really.

39:19.005 --> 39:19.462
Another time...

39:19.672 --> 39:20.255
- Did he say something to you?

39:20.464 --> 39:23.383
- No. No. He's a wonderful man, it's, uh,

39:23.592 --> 39:24.926
it's just, uh,

39:25.136 --> 39:28.179
I got a bit of a headache, you know.

39:28.389 --> 39:29.429
- I've got some Panadeine.

39:29.473 --> 39:32.267
- Doesn't help. Migraine, you know.

39:32.476 --> 39:35.895
I need those real strong
ones. I better push off.

39:38.441 --> 39:41.776
- It's him, isn't it? It's Dad.

39:41.986 --> 39:43.945
- No, it's not him.

39:44.155 --> 39:46.573
It's not you, or anyone.

39:46.782 --> 39:49.576
It's just me.

39:50.369 --> 39:53.079
I can't hack it.

39:53.748 --> 39:54.908
Bringing your boyfriend home,

39:54.999 --> 39:56.416
and not having to lie and pretend.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.585
Look, I think it's really
terrific what you've got

39:58.753 --> 40:00.128
with him, I really do.

40:00.755 --> 40:02.714
- But?

40:06.093 --> 40:08.219
- It hurts a bit.

40:10.973 --> 40:13.475
It makes me feel guilty about what we do.

40:16.812 --> 40:19.689
Maybe it's too domestic.
Sort of makes the atmosphere,

40:20.649 --> 40:22.650
I don't know, not very sexy.

40:25.946 --> 40:28.740
I'd like to see you again,
Jeff. I really would.

40:29.450 --> 40:32.327
I like you a lot. You're
a really nice guy.

40:32.536 --> 40:34.704
So is your dad.

40:37.792 --> 40:39.918
Tell him I said good-bye.

40:52.765 --> 40:55.642
- Don't go, mate. Please.

40:57.186 --> 40:59.604
I like you, mate, you know.

40:59.814 --> 41:00.522
I don't just mean sex.

41:00.731 --> 41:02.774
We don't have to do that,
if you'd rather not.

41:03.734 --> 41:06.111
I like you as a person, you know.

41:07.446 --> 41:10.824
I feel comfy with you.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.618
Just don't go, please.

41:14.161 --> 41:17.413
We can talk, get to know each other a bit,

41:20.960 --> 41:23.294
I'm wasting my breath, aren't I?

41:23.879 --> 41:25.755
- Yeah, sorry.

41:27.424 --> 41:30.260
- No, I'm sorry.

41:33.973 --> 41:35.515
- I'll see you, then?

41:35.724 --> 41:37.183
- Yeah, mate. Of course.

41:37.393 --> 41:38.434
- I do like you, Jeff.

41:38.644 --> 41:41.020
- Ta.

42:08.674 --> 42:11.050
I went down to Melbourne once.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.344
Kevin had moved there and I thought,

42:13.554 --> 42:15.638
I thought I could talk him
into getting back with me.

42:15.848 --> 42:18.474
Didn't work, of course.

42:18.684 --> 42:21.060
The point is I went down by train,

42:21.270 --> 42:24.189
and there was this woman.

42:24.398 --> 42:26.149
Couldn't take my eyes off her.

42:26.358 --> 42:27.901
Suddenly, she said,

42:28.110 --> 42:30.361
Oh.

42:30.571 --> 42:33.531
The agonizing pain of it all.

42:35.534 --> 42:38.244
The agonizing pain.

42:47.421 --> 42:50.924
Oh, the agonizing pain of it
all, that's what she said.

42:52.092 --> 42:54.594
I've often wondered what she meant but...

42:55.721 --> 42:58.806
I suppose I knew, straight away.

43:00.059 --> 43:02.894
She just wanted someone to talk to.

43:03.103 --> 43:04.896
Someone to laugh with,
have a good time with,

43:05.105 --> 43:06.898
get drunk with.

43:07.107 --> 43:08.775
Cuddle up to.

43:10.486 --> 43:13.238
Doesn't seem a lot to ask, does it?

43:17.743 --> 43:18.326
I mean, for fuck's sake,

43:18.535 --> 43:20.745
how can you be too bloody domestic?

43:25.668 --> 43:28.127
- A sensational value of 239,

43:28.337 --> 43:30.088
It's part of a new range
that includes a two

43:30.297 --> 43:32.257
and a half seater, a sleeper
sleeper sofa version,

43:32.424 --> 43:34.092
and you can buy matching chairs.

43:34.301 --> 43:36.552
We have all of them now in stock.

44:24.059 --> 44:26.686
- He seemed like such a nice lad, too.

44:26.895 --> 44:28.646
- Yeah, didn't he?

44:29.773 --> 44:32.483
- Are you seeing him again?

44:36.280 --> 44:38.489
Plenty more fish in the sea, eh?

44:39.700 --> 44:41.034
I was, uh,

44:41.243 --> 44:43.703
wondering what you'd like
for tea, tomorrow night.

44:43.912 --> 44:45.163
Thought I'd buy a leg of lamb.

44:45.372 --> 44:46.873
You always like a roast.

44:47.082 --> 44:49.584
Nice baked potatoes, thick gravy,

44:49.793 --> 44:50.793
and, uh,

44:50.836 --> 44:52.462
don't forget to sort out your laundry.

44:52.671 --> 44:55.006
I'll get it done for you tomorrow.

45:04.433 --> 45:08.186
You ever thought of going
to an introduction agency?

45:10.189 --> 45:12.357
One of those, uh,

45:12.566 --> 45:13.691
computer dating services?

45:13.901 --> 45:15.661
They've got them in
those magazines of yours.

45:15.861 --> 45:18.613
- Not tonight, Dad.

45:19.323 --> 45:21.449
Some other time, maybe.

45:25.037 --> 45:26.329
- Fair enough.

45:30.667 --> 45:33.920
Don't stay up too late, will you, son?

45:34.129 --> 45:36.089
- No, Dad.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.392
She comes into my mind, from time to time.

45:50.229 --> 45:52.230
That woman on the train.

- Joyce.

46:47.703 --> 46:49.662
- Mr. Mitchell.

46:51.623 --> 46:54.125
- Please...

46:54.334 --> 46:56.669
Call me Harry.

47:00.132 --> 47:02.800
- That's very thoughtful.

47:14.104 --> 47:18.024
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

47:53.936 --> 47:55.645
- Thank you, darling.

48:26.802 --> 48:29.929
- Look at you. You're on a winning streak.

48:30.138 --> 48:31.681
- Ever since I met you, Joyce.

48:31.890 --> 48:33.891
You look wonderful.

48:34.101 --> 48:35.861
- I must say, you always
know the right thing

48:35.978 --> 48:37.770
to say to a woman.

48:37.980 --> 48:38.980
- Well!

48:39.147 --> 48:40.606
Life without women would be like

48:40.816 --> 48:43.192
a barbecue without beer, wouldn't it?

48:46.530 --> 48:49.574
Speaking of which, shall we go?

48:49.783 --> 48:52.326
I've reserved our usual table.

48:57.207 --> 49:00.126
- I haven't had so much fun in ages.

49:00.335 --> 49:02.175
- This is getting a bit
serious, isn't it, Mum?

49:02.337 --> 49:03.963
- No, no, it's just fun to

49:04.172 --> 49:08.217
go out again with someone you like,

49:08.427 --> 49:10.344
who obviously likes you.

49:10.554 --> 49:11.679
- Mum.

49:11.888 --> 49:13.556
- It's all right, dear.

49:13.765 --> 49:16.142
Harry's great, but we'll
take it step by step.

49:16.351 --> 49:18.644
I'm a bit more wary, these days.

49:19.605 --> 49:22.231
- Hey, look. Dad left
you. It wasn't your fault.

49:22.441 --> 49:25.401
- Well, of course it was, part of it.

49:25.611 --> 49:27.211
You can't put all the blame on one side,

49:27.237 --> 49:29.363
when a marriage breaks down.

49:29.615 --> 49:32.450
- Would you ever take him back?

49:32.659 --> 49:36.287
- No, dear. Never.

49:36.496 --> 49:39.290
Once bitten, and all that.

49:48.133 --> 49:49.216
- Jeff.

49:50.969 --> 49:52.219
Jeff.

50:06.109 --> 50:07.818
- Not much else to do, is there?

50:08.028 --> 50:09.428
- Sitting around here all the time,

50:09.529 --> 50:13.449
feeling sorry for
yourself. Getting stoned.

50:13.659 --> 50:14.992
You should be out looking at the world,

50:15.202 --> 50:16.452
making a contribution.

50:16.662 --> 50:18.245
Sowing your oats, eh?

50:18.455 --> 50:20.498
Something wonderful, like love,

50:20.707 --> 50:21.907
the greatest adventure of all.

50:22.084 --> 50:23.125
Your Gran said it once.

50:23.335 --> 50:25.503
- I make a contribution, mate.

50:25.712 --> 50:28.047
I look after people's drains.

50:29.049 --> 50:31.926
You know, life would be pretty
shitty without plumbers.

50:32.135 --> 50:33.803
- Not very romantic, though, is it?

50:34.012 --> 50:36.097
Not like planting a forest.

50:36.306 --> 50:38.057
- Fair go, mate. I'm just me.

50:38.266 --> 50:41.686
- I know you are.

50:41.895 --> 50:43.562
You have that freedom.

50:43.772 --> 50:45.398
So go on.

50:45.607 --> 50:47.441
Prove to me

50:47.651 --> 50:49.568
that the way I brought
you up wasn't wrong,

50:49.778 --> 50:51.237
that my mother wasn't wrong,

50:51.446 --> 50:53.239
that what she found was wonderful,

50:53.448 --> 50:54.657
that it was worth everything.

50:54.866 --> 50:56.575
All for love.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.413
That young Gary, he seemed clean enough.

51:00.622 --> 51:01.247
- Greg,

51:01.456 --> 51:03.207
Greg, don't start, Dad.

51:03.417 --> 51:06.919
Not now. Just go and have some fun.

51:08.088 --> 51:09.505
You, uh,

51:09.715 --> 51:12.883
got some rich widow you're
seeing on the sly, have you?

51:13.093 --> 51:15.302
- What if I have?

51:17.806 --> 51:21.100
You're not the only one
that gets lonely, son.

51:22.227 --> 51:24.979
I like women.

51:25.188 --> 51:27.940
I like the way they're put together.

51:28.150 --> 51:31.485
I like them all soft and squishy.

51:31.695 --> 51:33.946
I like having them, for Pete's sake.

51:34.156 --> 51:37.324
I'm sick of living in sin
with my own right hand.

51:37.534 --> 51:39.368
- Ease off, Dad.

51:39.578 --> 51:42.663
- Ah, that shouldn't worry you, should it?

51:42.873 --> 51:46.250
You're going for world-champion
wanker, aren't you?

51:48.795 --> 51:50.296
- Sorry about that.

51:50.505 --> 51:52.506
Got a bit carried away or
something, I don't know.

51:52.716 --> 51:55.176
I mean it's not quite like that.

51:55.886 --> 51:59.013
I mean, I do it.

51:59.222 --> 52:01.599
Of course I do, who doesn't?

52:01.808 --> 52:04.018
Got to relieve the tension, somehow.

52:04.227 --> 52:05.186
But he makes it sound like I'm some sort

52:05.395 --> 52:08.147
of rampant sex maniac.

52:09.316 --> 52:14.278
You don't like to think of your
own Dad doing that, do you?

52:15.822 --> 52:18.616
I mean, you know he must.

52:18.825 --> 52:21.160
Doesn't seem quite right, does it?

52:26.875 --> 52:30.169
- He drives me screaming
up the walls, sometimes.

52:30.378 --> 52:31.837
It's not an easy thing
for a man to accept,

52:32.047 --> 52:33.631
that his mother's been
doing it with another woman

52:33.840 --> 52:35.883
for forty years.

52:39.221 --> 52:41.430
I used to wonder that the love between

52:41.640 --> 52:43.265
them must be extraordinary,

52:43.475 --> 52:45.643
if they were prepared to risk everything,

52:45.852 --> 52:47.686
all for love.

52:48.772 --> 52:52.525
That's when I started to
think about blokes and blokes.

52:52.734 --> 52:54.374
Never did it, of course. Never wanted to.

52:56.154 --> 52:59.949
I think it was the idea of the
hairy bums that put me off.

53:28.436 --> 53:30.156
But if what Mum and
Mary had was so amazing,

53:30.355 --> 53:33.107
You know, I thought maybe
it's the same for men, too.

53:33.400 --> 53:35.442
Anyway,

53:36.111 --> 53:39.363
I met my wife, then there was Jeff.

53:39.573 --> 53:41.699
I thought, Ah, well, it's in the blood.

53:41.908 --> 53:43.701
It's just skipped a generation, you know,

53:43.910 --> 53:45.578
from my mother to him.

53:50.876 --> 53:53.627
I made up my mind that no matter what,

53:53.837 --> 53:56.171
he'd be his own man.

53:56.381 --> 53:59.091
And I knew that I'd love him.

53:59.843 --> 54:02.928
But he drives me screaming
up the wall, sometimes.

54:08.018 --> 54:10.436
- This has all been a bit
of a shock to me, Harry.

54:10.645 --> 54:12.354
Us getting on so well.

54:12.564 --> 54:14.481
It's a nice shock, I might add.

54:14.691 --> 54:17.359
I didn't have very high hopes
when I went to that agency.

54:18.278 --> 54:20.988
I never expected anything serious.

54:21.781 --> 54:24.158
- It is, on my part.

54:24.367 --> 54:26.952
- How serious?

54:27.162 --> 54:28.746
- I want you to meet Jeff.

54:28.955 --> 54:31.457
Then if the two of you get on...

54:31.666 --> 54:34.251
I'm going to pop the question.

54:34.461 --> 54:37.379
- And, um, if we don't?

54:38.173 --> 54:40.174
We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.

54:40.383 --> 54:41.675
- Wow.

54:41.885 --> 54:44.261
I wouldn't want to come
between you two, anyway.

54:44.471 --> 54:47.848
You seem very close.

54:52.020 --> 54:54.146
- We've got to think of
ourselves first, Joyce.

54:54.356 --> 54:57.066
- It's a big step, all the same.

54:57.275 --> 55:00.986
But I guess we should put
our cards on the table.

55:01.696 --> 55:03.447
Look,

55:03.823 --> 55:06.241
I might not be very, um,

55:06.451 --> 55:08.577
imaginative in the bed department, Harry,

55:08.787 --> 55:10.496
but I never said no to my husband,

55:10.705 --> 55:13.374
not in all the years we were married.

55:13.875 --> 55:15.876
- Not once?

55:16.086 --> 55:19.254
- Well obviously there were
certain times after Jenny

55:19.464 --> 55:21.173
was born and when I wasn't
well. But no, apart from that

55:21.383 --> 55:24.760
he always got his onions,
whenever he wanted them.

55:24.970 --> 55:26.650
Could have had them a bit more often, too,

55:26.680 --> 55:29.598
if he'd played his cards right.

55:29.808 --> 55:32.267
I like to be wooed.

55:32.477 --> 55:35.604
- Yes, you do, don't you?

55:35.814 --> 55:38.232
- So, as long as you're not too demanding,

55:38.441 --> 55:41.110
you'll get what you want, on that score.

55:44.572 --> 55:47.282
- I think we should stop
beating around the bush.

55:47.492 --> 55:50.160
- I didn't think I was.

55:50.370 --> 55:52.371
- Well, you don't have
to give me your answer,

55:52.580 --> 55:54.957
straight away, but, um,

55:55.166 --> 55:58.293
you know what's on my mind.

56:03.425 --> 56:06.176
Will you marry me?

56:13.393 --> 56:15.185
What's all this?

56:15.395 --> 56:17.021
What's this all about?

56:17.230 --> 56:20.274
Eh? What's the matter?

56:20.775 --> 56:23.318
- I'd given up hope.

56:23.528 --> 56:27.322
I just didn't think it was
going to happen to me again.

56:27.907 --> 56:30.743
- No, neither did I.

56:31.745 --> 56:34.747
- I've been so lonely for so
long, and I just didn't think.

56:36.624 --> 56:40.335
It's you kneeling down that did it.

56:43.548 --> 56:45.591
- Well,

56:45.800 --> 56:48.093
will you?

56:49.012 --> 56:50.554
- No.

56:51.931 --> 56:53.432
- Why?

56:53.725 --> 56:55.100
I thought...

56:55.310 --> 56:57.144
- It's too soon.

56:57.353 --> 56:59.605
I don't want to make another mistake.

56:59.814 --> 57:02.900
Look, let's give it six months.

57:03.109 --> 57:05.527
And then if we still feel the same way...

57:06.654 --> 57:09.573
- Make it three months.

57:10.575 --> 57:13.494
- It's all that talk about sex, isn't it?

57:13.703 --> 57:16.580
It's got you all worked up.

57:16.790 --> 57:21.585
All right. Three months.

57:21.795 --> 57:23.420
- Joyce.

57:29.552 --> 57:32.888
I can't say I'm the happiest
I've ever been in my life,

57:33.098 --> 57:36.767
but I'm the happiest I can
remember being for a very long time

57:51.574 --> 57:55.786
- Yeah mate, mate,
that's you, that is you.

57:56.996 --> 57:59.248
You can't wear Y-fronts
all your life, mate.

58:16.975 --> 58:19.351
- No, let's just get one
already at the butcher's.

58:19.561 --> 58:21.645
- Yeah. Go with the frozen ones.

58:39.539 --> 58:41.039
Too small.

58:41.249 --> 58:41.874
- What's got into you this year?

58:42.083 --> 58:44.003
- That's twice the size
the one we normally have.

58:44.127 --> 58:44.793
- We don't make enough of Christmas,

58:45.003 --> 58:48.338
That's our trouble. It's the
season of goodwill, family.

58:48.548 --> 58:51.425
It's high time you started
thinking about a family

58:51.634 --> 58:53.594
of your own, find some nice young fellow,

58:53.803 --> 58:55.262
get set up in life.

58:55.471 --> 58:56.638
- It's not that flaming easy.

58:56.848 --> 58:59.183
Doesn't just happen to order.

58:59.392 --> 59:01.351
The choice is a bit more
limited, for one thing.

59:02.270 --> 59:03.750
Maybe some places like San Francisco,

59:03.855 --> 59:05.105
all the blokes wear their
dicks on their sleeves.

59:05.315 --> 59:07.608
- You ever thought of
going there for a holiday?

59:07.817 --> 59:09.610
- I don't want to live like that, Dad.

59:09.819 --> 59:10.652
I don't want to live in a world

59:10.862 --> 59:13.405
that just begins and ends with being gay.

59:13.615 --> 59:15.991
I like having all sorts of people around.

59:16.201 --> 59:18.410
Kids and old folks, every
sort of person there is.

59:18.620 --> 59:21.872
I don't want to live in a world
without women. I like women.

59:22.415 --> 59:24.135
Me and the girls in the
office get on great.

59:24.167 --> 59:25.967
They know, they don't
care. We laugh about it.

59:26.085 --> 59:28.045
Fancy the same blokes sometimes.

59:28.254 --> 59:30.422
Even fancied a couple of the
girls. Done it with a few

59:30.632 --> 59:33.133
of them to make sure I wasn't
missing out on anything.

59:33.343 --> 59:35.093
- You've done it with girls?

59:35.303 --> 59:37.721
You never told me that.

59:37.931 --> 59:39.223
- Yeah.

59:39.432 --> 59:41.308
I didn't want you to get your hopes up.

59:41.517 --> 59:42.059
- Did you like it?

59:42.268 --> 59:43.769
See what I mean?

59:43.978 --> 59:45.479
- Hey, hey.

59:46.397 --> 59:47.564
Bugger it.

59:47.774 --> 59:48.982
Could you get it up?

59:49.192 --> 59:50.776
- Of course I could. It's not
exactly an obstacle course.

59:50.985 --> 59:52.945
I quite enjoyed it, actually.
Something different.

59:53.029 --> 59:57.282
But they just don't
turn me on like men do.

01:00:00.453 --> 01:00:03.038
- Would, would you like to try it again?

01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:04.688
No, Dad. Not off the top of my head.

01:00:04.707 --> 01:00:06.427
See what I mean about
getting your hopes up?

01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:08.585
I like doing it with blokes,
Dad. I don't think that's ever

01:00:08.795 --> 01:00:11.213
going to change because I don't
want it to, I don't want to

01:00:11.422 --> 01:00:14.466
be limited by others' ideas of
who I am. Yours or anyone else's

01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:16.885
- I don't think I've ever
put any limits on you, Jeff.

01:00:17.095 --> 01:00:18.178
- I...

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.140
Dad, I know.

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:24.059
You've been great, mate.

01:00:24.269 --> 01:00:26.228
The best dad in the world, I reckon.

01:00:26.437 --> 01:00:29.022
The fairest, that's a certain fact.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.816
I don't often say it, but it's Christmas.

01:00:31.025 --> 01:00:34.611
So thanks, mate, for everything.

01:00:34.946 --> 01:00:36.571
I mean, you give me the
first-class shits at times,

01:00:36.781 --> 01:00:38.824
and I suppose I do you.

01:00:39.033 --> 01:00:43.036
But I don't think there's
many got a father like you.

01:00:44.747 --> 01:00:48.583
- And I'm a very lucky man
to have a son like you, mate.

01:00:53.214 --> 01:00:55.132
What do you reckon?

01:00:59.971 --> 01:01:01.888
- How are we going to get the fucker home?

01:01:16.487 --> 01:01:18.280
- Magnificent,

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:20.782
just what Christmas should be.

01:01:20.992 --> 01:01:21.992
- Tada.

01:01:22.118 --> 01:01:24.119
Oh, not her again. I thought
we'd ditch the bitch.

01:01:24.329 --> 01:01:25.495
- Never!

01:01:25.705 --> 01:01:28.081
Your mother bought her the
first Christmas of our marriage,

01:01:28.291 --> 01:01:30.334
just before you were born.

01:01:30.543 --> 01:01:34.588
I suppose some people
might see that as an omen.

01:01:37.342 --> 01:01:38.425
- She's looking a bit tacky, Dad.

01:01:38.634 --> 01:01:40.344
Why can't we get a nice
star, or something?

01:01:40.553 --> 01:01:42.512
- Not as long as I'm alive.

01:01:42.722 --> 01:01:45.640
You can do what you like when I'm gone.

01:01:46.059 --> 01:01:48.393
Your mother loved her.

01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:53.690
- I miss her, Dad.

01:01:54.317 --> 01:01:55.942
I miss her like crazy.

01:01:56.152 --> 01:01:58.695
- Not half as much as I do, lad.

01:01:58.905 --> 01:02:01.490
It's not possible.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.118
- Yeah, mate, I know.

01:02:05.328 --> 01:02:07.371
I'm sorry.

01:02:09.957 --> 01:02:13.377
- I think about her sometimes.

01:02:13.586 --> 01:02:16.963
Sitting on a fluffy white cloud
in a place called paradise.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.633
Surrounded by lots of

01:02:19.842 --> 01:02:23.095
fat little naked babies sprouting wings.

01:02:23.846 --> 01:02:27.474
And angels playing harps,
making pretty music.

01:02:27.683 --> 01:02:32.062
Waiting for me to come along and join her.

01:02:32.814 --> 01:02:35.941
It helps, sometimes.

01:02:36.943 --> 01:02:39.903
Sometimes it makes it worse.

01:02:42.532 --> 01:02:45.784
Sometimes I miss her so much,

01:02:45.993 --> 01:02:48.829
I can hardly wait to
hear the pretty music.

01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:55.210
- Come on, Dad.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.796
Cheer up, you old
pisshead. Give me a hand.

01:02:58.798 --> 01:03:00.048
- Yeah, well, you know.

01:03:00.258 --> 01:03:01.591
- You should take a leaf
out of your own book, mate.

01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:04.719
I mean, there's bound to be a
few oldwidows floating around.

01:03:05.471 --> 01:03:06.847
- There's a few young ones, too.

01:03:07.056 --> 01:03:09.266
- But I mean within the
realms of possibility, mate.

01:03:09.475 --> 01:03:11.017
Somebody who'll fancy you.

01:03:11.227 --> 01:03:13.228
- Would it worry you if there was?

01:03:13.438 --> 01:03:15.814
- Hell, no, mate, it'd be great.

01:03:16.023 --> 01:03:18.775
- Well, there is.

01:03:18.985 --> 01:03:21.528
- What?

01:03:22.071 --> 01:03:24.406
You old dog.

01:03:24.615 --> 01:03:27.033
How long has this been going on?

01:03:27.243 --> 01:03:28.743
- A while.

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:31.246
- You are lower than a
snake's belly, know that?

01:03:31.456 --> 01:03:32.622
Not a single word to me about this.

01:03:32.832 --> 01:03:35.625
- Now don't go getting all hurt.

01:03:35.835 --> 01:03:38.962
I just wanted to be sure.

01:03:41.507 --> 01:03:43.341
- Cause for celebration?

01:03:43.551 --> 01:03:45.427
- I'll drink to that.

01:03:52.894 --> 01:03:54.936
- So, um...

01:03:55.271 --> 01:03:57.814
Have you, uh...

01:03:58.733 --> 01:04:00.400
Have you stuck it up her yet?

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:02.194
- You dirty bastard!

01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:03.320
You have, haven't you?
Is that where you've been

01:04:03.529 --> 01:04:04.196
all those night?

01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:05.363
- Listen, don't you talk
about Joyce like that,

01:04:05.573 --> 01:04:08.116
if you don't mind. She's a
very refined kind of person.

01:04:09.744 --> 01:04:13.830
- So is it love then, Dad?

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.373
- No.

01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:18.084
I mean, I can't honestly say that it is.

01:04:18.294 --> 01:04:21.880
But it might be the next best thing.

01:04:22.215 --> 01:04:23.965
- Cheers.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:26.176
- Cheers.

01:04:30.598 --> 01:04:32.974
- So, when's it going to be?

01:04:33.184 --> 01:04:34.809
- Well,

01:04:35.019 --> 01:04:36.770
we haven't set the big day.

01:04:36.979 --> 01:04:39.064
- But you're going to?

01:04:39.273 --> 01:04:42.526
- Yeah. I, you know, if
she gets on with you.

01:04:42.735 --> 01:04:45.195
- I do not come into this.

01:04:45.404 --> 01:04:46.738
Unless you need me to
move out or anything.

01:04:46.948 --> 01:04:48.698
- Of course I don't, Jeff.

01:04:48.908 --> 01:04:51.243
And nor would Joyce want that.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:53.245
She knows about you.

01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:55.664
- Yeah?

01:04:56.916 --> 01:05:00.210
You haven't told her
everything, have you, Dad?

01:05:00.419 --> 01:05:01.419
- Well, no. I mean...

01:05:01.587 --> 01:05:02.879
- Dad.

01:05:03.089 --> 01:05:03.797
- Well look.

01:05:04.006 --> 01:05:05.590
Joyce is a very kind

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.592
and understanding woman.

01:05:07.802 --> 01:05:09.970
You'll love her and she will love you.

01:05:10.179 --> 01:05:13.723
And, uh, you know, when things
work out, because they will,

01:05:13.933 --> 01:05:16.560
Uh, well, you can stay
here, in your own home,

01:05:16.769 --> 01:05:17.769
as long as you like.

01:05:17.812 --> 01:05:20.105
Until such time as you want
to move out on your own

01:05:20.314 --> 01:05:22.566
or with someone.

01:05:25.653 --> 01:05:27.779
- Well I'll be, huh?

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.866
- Merry Christmas, son.

01:05:32.076 --> 01:05:34.786
- Come here, you old bastard.

01:05:35.788 --> 01:05:38.164
Merry Christmas, Dad.

01:05:51.137 --> 01:05:52.721
- Joyce.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:53.930
Happy New year.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.682
- Happy new year, Harry.

01:06:06.027 --> 01:06:09.654
- Aren't you going to shut the door?

01:06:11.157 --> 01:06:12.782
- Sorry.

01:06:19.999 --> 01:06:23.126
- Ah. Is this Jeff?

01:06:23.336 --> 01:06:24.753
- Yes.

01:06:24.962 --> 01:06:26.880
On his 21st.

01:06:27.089 --> 01:06:30.342
- Oh, takes after his dad
in the looks department.

01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:31.551
- You reckon?

01:06:31.719 --> 01:06:33.595
Some people say they
can't see the resemblance.

01:06:33.804 --> 01:06:36.139
- I find that difficult to believe.

01:06:48.402 --> 01:06:49.778
Um...

01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:52.822
I'm really hanging out for a drink.

01:06:59.872 --> 01:07:01.122
- Make yourself at home.

01:07:01.332 --> 01:07:03.291
- Yeah.

01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:06.544
- Jeff out on the town tonight?

01:07:06.754 --> 01:07:07.921
- Too right.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.381
New Year's Eve.

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:12.384
Don't expect him home until the morning.

01:07:12.593 --> 01:07:14.177
- Right.

01:07:14.387 --> 01:07:17.514
This is really pleasant out here, Harry.

01:07:19.642 --> 01:07:22.185
- You sound, uh, surprised.

01:07:22.395 --> 01:07:23.895
- Oh, well, you know,

01:07:24.105 --> 01:07:27.941
two blokes living together,
you keep it really neat and

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:30.235
tidy.

01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:36.199
Ah.

01:07:37.326 --> 01:07:39.661
What are these doing here?

01:07:46.544 --> 01:07:49.546
- Oh, to be honest, uh, I bought them.

01:07:50.339 --> 01:07:52.006
- What?

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.342
Why?

01:07:56.721 --> 01:07:59.389
- Well, uh, Jeff's, uh...

01:08:01.726 --> 01:08:03.268
- Oh.

01:08:03.811 --> 01:08:05.687
I see.

01:08:05.938 --> 01:08:07.188
Ah.

01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:11.484
Why didn't you tell me?

01:08:15.698 --> 01:08:18.366
- I was going to. Um, I know I should've.

01:08:18.658 --> 01:08:19.701
- You bought these?

01:08:19.868 --> 01:08:21.453
You encourage him?

01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:23.580
Jesus, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

01:08:23.788 --> 01:08:27.041
You ought to be ashamed of him!

01:08:33.883 --> 01:08:37.218
- I've never been
ashamed of Jeff. Not ever.

01:08:37.428 --> 01:08:40.180
How can I be ashamed of
what my seed's become?

01:08:40.389 --> 01:08:42.849
What my love's become.

01:08:44.727 --> 01:08:46.352
- You couldn't tell me.

01:08:46.562 --> 01:08:48.921
I mean, it's probably the most
important thing in your life,

01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:50.814
and you couldn't tell me.

01:08:51.024 --> 01:08:52.274
- It doesn't change anything.

01:08:52.484 --> 01:08:53.943
- Well, it does to me.

01:08:54.153 --> 01:08:56.321
All this time I've been thinking

01:08:56.529 --> 01:09:00.158
I've been getting to know
you, you've been lying to me.

01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:02.285
- I never actually lied.

01:09:02.495 --> 01:09:05.705
- It amounts to the same thing.

01:09:11.754 --> 01:09:12.921
- Just meet Jeff.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:14.339
You'll love him.

01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:15.756
You'll see.

01:09:15.966 --> 01:09:17.966
- Harry, no. I can't.

01:09:18.176 --> 01:09:21.011
Not now. It's not just him,
anyway; it's everything.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.098
I can't.

01:09:25.559 --> 01:09:26.225
- Joyce.

01:09:26.435 --> 01:09:28.228
- I just need to be on my own for a bit.

01:09:28.437 --> 01:09:31.564
Sort things out in my head.

01:09:31.774 --> 01:09:36.152
It was so good for a while there, Harry.

01:09:36.362 --> 01:09:39.154
If only you'd been honest.

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:56.089
- Ashamed of Jeff?

01:09:56.298 --> 01:09:58.758
Never.

01:09:58.968 --> 01:10:00.593
Disappointed?

01:10:00.803 --> 01:10:03.263
Yeah, disappointed that...

01:10:03.472 --> 01:10:07.559
he'll never give me a
grandchild. Disappointed that...

01:10:07.768 --> 01:10:09.644
I honestly believe he'd be missing out

01:10:09.854 --> 01:10:12.063
on something wonderful.

01:10:12.273 --> 01:10:14.524
What I had with his mum,

01:10:14.733 --> 01:10:16.860
making a baby.

01:10:17.069 --> 01:10:21.489
Knowing that I'd put the seed
in there and watching it grow,

01:10:22.449 --> 01:10:25.368
then seeing him.

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:30.915
But if he's never going to have that,

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:34.377
then I want him to have
all the things he can have.

01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:38.673
Our children are only the sum of us.

01:10:38.883 --> 01:10:40.466
What we add up to.

01:10:40.676 --> 01:10:43.219
Us, and our parents

01:10:43.429 --> 01:10:45.388
And our grandparents and theirs.

01:10:45.598 --> 01:10:48.641
All the generations.

01:12:30.327 --> 01:12:32.495
- Hello, mate.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:39.460
They said you'd be up soon.

01:12:46.635 --> 01:12:49.554
Why'd you go and do a silly
bloody thing like that for?

01:13:02.067 --> 01:13:05.194
You've had a bit of a stroke, Dad.

01:13:07.031 --> 01:13:10.366
It was more than a bit of one, actually.

01:13:14.121 --> 01:13:16.914
Did they tell you what
it was going to be like?

01:13:22.796 --> 01:13:26.257
You'll be all right, mate.

01:13:26.675 --> 01:13:29.844
I'll look after you, no sweat.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.890
Things will be just the same
as always, Dad, I promise.

01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:44.734
Can I get you anything?

01:13:45.736 --> 01:13:47.695
Need to go for a wee or something?

01:13:50.199 --> 01:13:53.201
Silly, eh? 'Suppose they look
after that sort of thing here.

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:55.703
But still, you never know.

01:14:09.134 --> 01:14:11.552
Why do you keep moving your hand?

01:14:22.898 --> 01:14:25.817
Can you hear me?

01:14:30.697 --> 01:14:32.240
Once for "yes."

01:14:42.417 --> 01:14:44.293
Twice for "no."

01:14:50.759 --> 01:14:52.593
Oh, Dad.

01:15:32.926 --> 01:15:34.385
- Smooth.

01:15:41.435 --> 01:15:43.853
Are you knocking off early?

01:15:44.062 --> 01:15:45.521
- What do you mean, it's five past.

01:15:45.731 --> 01:15:47.523
- What are you, a bloody
clock-watcher now?

01:15:47.733 --> 01:15:49.650
I thought you might give
us a few minutes extra.

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.180
Considering that cock-up you made

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.447
with that bed of Pansies last week.

01:15:58.702 --> 01:16:01.370
- He's a prick. Don't Take any notice.

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:04.540
- Water off a duck's back.

01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:08.294
- You're in a good mood.

01:16:08.503 --> 01:16:11.130
You piss off, I'll put your gear away.

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:13.633
- Thanks, mate.

01:16:44.831 --> 01:16:47.667
- Great, boys! Is there
going to be a rodeo later?

01:16:48.335 --> 01:16:49.961
- Hey, why don't you come
with us, Walter? Come with us!

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.214
- Love to.

01:16:53.632 --> 01:16:56.133
- Marty! Marty! We'll see you there.

01:16:56.551 --> 01:16:58.803
See you down there.

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:16.830
- Police
estimate tonight's crowd

01:17:16.863 --> 01:17:18.948
to be nearly 600,000.

01:17:19.157 --> 01:17:21.325
This is believed to be
the largest crowd ever

01:17:21.535 --> 01:17:24.370
to gather for the Gay
and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

01:18:37.527 --> 01:18:38.778
- Mum.

01:18:38.987 --> 01:18:41.906
What are you doing up?

01:18:42.199 --> 01:18:43.491
- You're late.

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.743
What have you been doing?

01:18:45.952 --> 01:18:46.327
What were you doing?

01:18:46.536 --> 01:18:48.537
You were all over the late news!

01:18:48.747 --> 01:18:50.831
- I was having a good time with my mates.

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:54.001
- I ought to beat the shit out of you.

01:18:54.795 --> 01:18:56.670
- Well, why don't you try?

01:19:00.008 --> 01:19:02.551
- Get out. Get out of here now.

01:19:02.761 --> 01:19:05.096
You can come back once for
your things, when I'm not here.

01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:06.305
Then that's it.

01:19:06.431 --> 01:19:08.682
I never want to see you again.

01:19:08.892 --> 01:19:10.935
- He doesn't mean it, Gregory. He's angry.

01:19:11.144 --> 01:19:13.187
- No. He does, Mum.

01:19:13.397 --> 01:19:18.275
- Damn right, I do.

01:19:21.154 --> 01:19:24.407
- Fair enough.

01:19:41.883 --> 01:19:44.635
- Here you go, Dad.

01:19:45.512 --> 01:19:47.555
I fixed it up a treat, mate.

01:19:49.683 --> 01:19:50.891
Now we can talk to each other, sort of.

01:19:51.101 --> 01:19:53.227
What do you think? It's good, isn't it?

01:19:55.814 --> 01:19:58.649
No, it's not silly, Mate.
It's good. It works well.

01:20:00.318 --> 01:20:02.570
I thought we'd have an outing this arvo,

01:20:02.779 --> 01:20:04.947
take you down the supermarket.

01:20:05.157 --> 01:20:06.824
Pick up a nice bit of Fish for your tea,

01:20:07.033 --> 01:20:09.618
Some of that frozen
lasagna you like so much.

01:20:10.745 --> 01:20:12.105
Here's the remote. You want it on?

01:20:21.214 --> 01:20:22.548
What about your wee pan?

01:20:22.757 --> 01:20:24.258
Need a piss?

01:20:24.468 --> 01:20:25.468
Come on, Harry, now.

01:20:25.677 --> 01:20:28.512
You know you're not
going to be able to piss

01:20:28.847 --> 01:20:29.555
in the supermarket, right, hmm?

01:20:29.764 --> 01:20:33.017
I'll just go and get us
ready. Back in a tick.

01:20:38.565 --> 01:20:40.524
- The trouble with having a stroke

01:20:40.734 --> 01:20:43.694
is that people treat you
like a fuckwit afterwards.

01:21:09.387 --> 01:21:10.429
- Shut up, Dad.

01:21:10.639 --> 01:21:13.140
Don't make a row.

01:21:22.734 --> 01:21:24.151
- Jeff.

01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:27.571
- G'day.

01:21:27.781 --> 01:21:28.781
Thought it was you.

01:21:28.823 --> 01:21:30.491
- G'day, Greg.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.660
How're you going, Mr. Mitchell?

01:21:32.869 --> 01:21:33.911
Not too good, by the look of things.

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.704
Dad's had a bit of a stroke.

01:21:35.914 --> 01:21:38.374
Yeah, I heard. Down the pub.

01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:40.000
- He can't, uh, speak or anything,

01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:41.669
But he knows it's you.

01:21:41.878 --> 01:21:44.588
- How can you tell?

01:21:44.798 --> 01:21:46.715
- Just can.

01:21:48.134 --> 01:21:49.176
So how are things?

01:21:49.386 --> 01:21:52.054
Oh, not bad. I've left home.

01:21:52.264 --> 01:21:53.013
- Your folks?

01:21:53.223 --> 01:21:55.474
- Mum's been great, but Dad, uh...

01:21:56.643 --> 01:21:58.060
Found a place of my own, actually.

01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:59.562
A studio flat, they call it.

01:21:59.771 --> 01:22:00.771
It's quite nice, but...

01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:01.772
There's hardly enough room to swing

01:22:01.982 --> 01:22:03.357
a cat, and it's pretty expensive.

01:22:05.735 --> 01:22:08.487
- I would've, uh, thought
you'd have found some nice...

01:22:08.697 --> 01:22:10.906
friend to move in with.

01:22:11.116 --> 01:22:13.033
- I wish.

01:22:13.243 --> 01:22:14.285
Uh, you know, I do meet blokes, but

01:22:14.494 --> 01:22:17.538
they're all only after one thing.

01:22:17.747 --> 01:22:20.082
That's not everything in life, is it?

01:22:20.625 --> 01:22:22.918
- Can't understand it.

01:22:33.847 --> 01:22:37.516
Look, we better push off.
I've got to get dad home.

01:22:37.726 --> 01:22:40.019
- Yeah, of course.

01:22:44.357 --> 01:22:46.483
- I'll see you later, Mr. Mitchell.
Hope you're feeling better soon.

01:22:46.693 --> 01:22:47.359
- Yeah, thanks Greg.

01:22:47.569 --> 01:22:48.652
- Listen, uh,

01:22:48.862 --> 01:22:49.612
I might drop round one night,

01:22:49.821 --> 01:22:51.697
and make sure he's looking
after you properly.

01:22:51.906 --> 01:22:53.949
- Uh, probably be a bit difficult.

01:22:54.159 --> 01:22:55.034
- Oh, well, if you don't want me to...

01:22:55.243 --> 01:22:57.745
- No, it's just, it's a
little difficult with Dad.

01:22:57.954 --> 01:22:59.413
- You've gotta have a life
of your own life, surely.

01:22:59.623 --> 01:23:02.249
- Yeah, of course... Dad, Dad,
Dad... yeah, of course I do.

01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:05.127
It's just, you know, maybe
when he's a bit better, eh?

01:23:05.337 --> 01:23:06.545
- Yeah.

01:23:06.755 --> 01:23:07.296
- Tooroo.

01:23:07.505 --> 01:23:09.048
- See you later.

01:23:27.817 --> 01:23:29.943
- Yeah, two ticks!

01:23:33.531 --> 01:23:34.865
- No, sorry. Don't want any.

01:23:35.075 --> 01:23:36.075
- Jeff,

01:23:36.284 --> 01:23:39.370
My name's Joyce Johnson.
I'm a friend of your dad's.

01:23:39.579 --> 01:23:42.873
- Joyce, yeah. Sorry, come in.

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:47.294
How is he?

01:23:47.504 --> 01:23:50.172
- As well as can be
expected, you know, um.

01:23:50.382 --> 01:23:53.092
Doc says he'll never walk again.
He can't speak, of course.

01:23:53.301 --> 01:23:54.802
Do you want to see him?

01:23:55.011 --> 01:23:57.429
- Oh, I didn't realize it was that bad.

01:23:57.639 --> 01:24:00.683
- He'd be pleased to see you.

01:24:04.354 --> 01:24:06.897
Dad, someone to see you.

01:24:07.565 --> 01:24:11.860
- Harry? I'm So sorry about you...

01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:14.363
About your being sick.

01:24:14.572 --> 01:24:17.074
- Oh, he's not sick now.

01:24:17.283 --> 01:24:20.077
- Look, I'll leave you two
alone, so you can have a chat.

01:24:20.662 --> 01:24:22.502
- Look, it's all right.
I just dropped by, I...

01:24:22.664 --> 01:24:25.499
- I'll make a cup of tea.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.103
- I'm really sorry, Harry.

01:25:05.039 --> 01:25:06.373
- Tea's ready.

01:25:06.583 --> 01:25:08.417
- Look, um, I won't stay.

01:25:08.626 --> 01:25:10.586
My daughter, um, Jenny,

01:25:10.795 --> 01:25:13.505
she's waiting for me.

01:25:14.966 --> 01:25:18.093
Bit of a shock, seeing him like that.

01:25:18.303 --> 01:25:20.053
He used to be so full of energy.

01:25:20.263 --> 01:25:21.346
- Ah, still is.

01:25:21.556 --> 01:25:22.514
Always wanting to go down the park.

01:25:22.724 --> 01:25:24.349
For a walk, or walk down the shops..

01:25:24.559 --> 01:25:26.602
Or 'wheel', I should say.

01:25:27.645 --> 01:25:29.188
- Must be difficult for you.

01:25:29.397 --> 01:25:30.481
- No.

01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:34.276
Got a nurse comes in
three times a week, and

01:25:34.486 --> 01:25:36.403
it's my dad, you know.

01:25:38.615 --> 01:25:41.283
Look, drop in again some time.

01:25:41.493 --> 01:25:44.328
He likes visitors.

01:25:46.289 --> 01:25:47.706
Sorry I gave you such a hard time, before.

01:25:47.916 --> 01:25:48.832
I thought you were one
of them missionaries.

01:25:49.042 --> 01:25:50.709
We get a lot of them around here.

01:25:50.919 --> 01:25:51.585
When it's blokes like the Mormons,

01:25:51.795 --> 01:25:54.546
I just open the door, tell 'em I'm
a poofter and watch them blush.

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:56.799
- You tell them what?

01:25:57.008 --> 01:25:58.884
- I'm a poofter.

01:25:59.511 --> 01:26:01.470
Didn't he tell you?

01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:02.262
Yeah, he was going to.

01:26:02.472 --> 01:26:04.014
He was a bit worried
about how you might react.

01:26:04.224 --> 01:26:05.682
- No, I knew.

01:26:07.227 --> 01:26:09.561
You're nothing like I expected.

01:26:15.527 --> 01:26:18.612
- Real sweet on you, he was.

01:26:19.823 --> 01:26:21.657
Had his heart set on you.

01:26:33.419 --> 01:26:36.004
- How was it? Are you ok?

01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:40.634
- There's no fool like an old
fool. Isn't that what they say?

01:26:42.554 --> 01:26:44.680
- You're not so old, Mum.

01:26:46.933 --> 01:26:48.183
- No.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.143
But I'm a fool.

01:27:23.595 --> 01:27:25.679
- My mother was 80.

01:27:25.889 --> 01:27:28.181
She was getting infirm, and

01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:31.393
Mary was a bit younger.

01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.605
But neither of them could
look after each other anymore.

01:27:34.814 --> 01:27:37.733
And we all made the
decision to split them up.

01:27:40.069 --> 01:27:44.448
My brother took Mum. And Mary...

01:27:45.033 --> 01:27:47.200
went to a home.

01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:49.494
It was for their own good.

01:27:49.913 --> 01:27:53.123
How many times did we tell ourselves that?

01:27:54.459 --> 01:27:56.877
We drove Mum away, and

01:27:57.086 --> 01:28:00.547
she didn't say a word. She
didn't speak for days. She just

01:28:00.757 --> 01:28:04.051
sat in her new bedroom with
her suitcase full of memories.

01:28:05.803 --> 01:28:10.766
And she died in her sleep one
night, not long after that.

01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:15.103
And I never had the chance,

01:28:16.105 --> 01:28:17.648
or the guts,

01:28:20.276 --> 01:28:23.153
To ask her the one thing I wanted to know.

01:28:24.614 --> 01:28:26.073
I always wanted to know

01:28:26.282 --> 01:28:29.785
What they said to each
other that last night,

01:28:29.994 --> 01:28:32.037
Lying there in that

01:28:32.497 --> 01:28:34.414
great old brass bed,

01:28:34.624 --> 01:28:37.084
knowing that it was for the last time.

01:28:37.293 --> 01:28:40.796
Knowing that they were never
going to see each other again.

01:28:41.005 --> 01:28:42.172
Knowing that they were being taken away

01:28:42.382 --> 01:28:46.718
To different places, to die.

01:28:46.928 --> 01:28:49.680
I can't imagine what they would have said.

01:28:49.889 --> 01:28:51.848
How do you say "thank you" for

01:28:52.058 --> 01:28:55.560
forty years of love?

01:28:55.937 --> 01:28:59.147
What words could you possibly find?

01:28:59.357 --> 01:29:00.983
By then,

01:29:01.192 --> 01:29:04.194
They were both as deaf as posts, so,

01:29:04.404 --> 01:29:05.654
they'd lie there,

01:29:05.863 --> 01:29:10.409
Shouting their love and their
good-byes to each other.

01:29:10.618 --> 01:29:12.452
Did they find

01:29:12.662 --> 01:29:15.497
comfort in the idea that they, uh,

01:29:15.707 --> 01:29:18.875
might meet again soon, in the next world?

01:29:21.838 --> 01:29:23.798
So, I don't know what I
would have said to Jeffrey

01:29:24.007 --> 01:29:26.550
if I'd known the stroke
was going to happen.

01:29:28.052 --> 01:29:30.303
I know I would have said something.

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.933
Only now, I'll never know what it was.

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:38.061
- Ok, Dad. Time for number twos.

01:29:44.068 --> 01:29:46.069
I'll be back in a bit to wipe your bum.

01:29:46.279 --> 01:29:49.072
Got the fish on for tea, right?

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.910
- I used to imagine, in my darker moments,

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.871
that it'd be the other way around.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.250
That, you know, he'd catch
that dreadful disease, and

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:03.879
I'd be the one nursing him to the grave.

01:30:04.088 --> 01:30:06.214
But not this.

01:30:06.424 --> 01:30:09.593
Dear God.

01:30:10.094 --> 01:30:12.054
Anything but this.

01:30:12.513 --> 01:30:13.805
Ah.

01:30:14.015 --> 01:30:17.601
Maybe in a few years' time, when
I'm gone, he'll find someone,

01:30:18.269 --> 01:30:20.812
even if it's only out of
sheer, bloody loneliness.

01:30:23.191 --> 01:30:25.609
But it won't be love,

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.695
because by then he'll have forgotten how.

01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:32.407
I can't imagine anything worse

01:30:32.617 --> 01:30:35.035
could happen to a human being, than that.

01:30:40.583 --> 01:30:42.250
Sorry.

01:30:43.503 --> 01:30:45.383
It always used to be a
very private thing to me,

01:30:45.546 --> 01:30:47.589
going to the lav.

01:30:47.799 --> 01:30:49.591
Not anymore.

01:31:02.522 --> 01:31:04.147
- Ripper of a day, isn't it?

01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:06.608
Weather report said it was going to rain.

01:31:06.818 --> 01:31:08.819
They still don't get it
right very often, do they?

01:31:19.330 --> 01:31:20.956
Might get an ice cream on the way home.

01:31:21.165 --> 01:31:22.205
Do you fancy an ice cream?

01:31:26.087 --> 01:31:27.462
Don't suppose you could
manage an ice block,

01:31:27.672 --> 01:31:29.172
not unless I chopped it up for ya.

01:31:29.382 --> 01:31:31.299
Might be a bit messy.

01:31:42.603 --> 01:31:44.187
You need to wee or anything, Dad?

01:31:49.068 --> 01:31:50.694
Well, I do.

01:31:52.071 --> 01:31:54.906
You'll be all right, Dad. I won't be long.

01:32:14.802 --> 01:32:16.136
- G'day.

01:32:17.013 --> 01:32:19.014
- Fancy meeting you here.

01:32:20.808 --> 01:32:21.808
- I'm planting.

01:32:21.934 --> 01:32:23.143
- What?

01:32:23.352 --> 01:32:23.977
- I'm...

01:32:24.187 --> 01:32:26.396
- Yeah, I know. I saw you from over there.

01:32:26.606 --> 01:32:27.355
Well, I wasn't actually sure it was you.

01:32:27.565 --> 01:32:29.316
I was just having a perv.

01:32:32.403 --> 01:32:33.904
Nice legs.

01:32:36.324 --> 01:32:37.804
- You're looking pretty fit yourself.

01:32:37.825 --> 01:32:39.743
- No, no, I need some sun.

01:32:40.828 --> 01:32:42.787
At least you've got a tan.

01:32:43.706 --> 01:32:45.582
- It's only my arms and legs.

01:32:45.791 --> 01:32:49.461
The rest of me is as white as a ghost.

01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:51.588
- Looks all right to me.

01:32:56.302 --> 01:32:58.094
You didn't come and see Dad.

01:33:00.514 --> 01:33:02.224
- Well, I didn't think you wanted me to.

01:33:03.684 --> 01:33:04.893
- Yeah, look,

01:33:05.102 --> 01:33:07.771
Sorry I was a bit off last
time I saw you, but...

01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:10.106
I wasn't sure how you'd
react to Dad, you know.

01:33:11.067 --> 01:33:12.525
It's not the most romantic
thing in the world, is it,

01:33:12.735 --> 01:33:15.111
looking after your father
after he's had a stroke?

01:33:18.241 --> 01:33:20.075
I thought you might think
it was too domestic.

01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:27.123
Look, the thing is, um,

01:33:28.876 --> 01:33:30.919
I'd really like to see you again.

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:49.479
You all right then, Dad?

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.680
I'll read to you for a bit, eh?

01:33:52.733 --> 01:33:53.933
Do you want me to read to you?

01:33:55.027 --> 01:33:56.361
No?

01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:57.237
What do you want to do?

01:33:57.446 --> 01:33:59.046
Sit here and listen to the flowers grow?

01:34:00.741 --> 01:34:02.033
All right.

01:34:02.952 --> 01:34:04.953
Sorry I was a while, but
I ran into young Greg.

01:34:06.163 --> 01:34:07.956
You probably remember him best as Gary.

01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:10.583
Could've knocked me down with a feather.

01:34:10.793 --> 01:34:12.073
But I suppose it's only natural,

01:34:12.211 --> 01:34:14.796
him being a gardener,
and this being a garden.

01:34:17.758 --> 01:34:19.050
Couldn't help myself.

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:20.719
I asked him over for tea one night.

01:34:20.928 --> 01:34:23.263
I was thinking he'd say, oh,
yeah, and that'd be that.

01:34:23.472 --> 01:34:24.097
Could've knocked me down with a feather

01:34:24.307 --> 01:34:26.057
when he said, would tomorrow be all right?

01:34:26.267 --> 01:34:28.310
Yeah, ripper, I said.

01:34:29.353 --> 01:34:31.021
I was a bit worried about you.

01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:32.814
How he'd feel about you.

01:34:33.024 --> 01:34:35.567
But he just shrugged and
said, that's life, isn't it?

01:34:37.028 --> 01:34:39.487
And he said he'd bring his toothbrush.

01:34:39.989 --> 01:34:41.281
That's making it fairly plain, isn't it?

01:34:41.490 --> 01:34:43.575
He might even stay the night.

01:34:46.579 --> 01:34:49.331
I'm not going to rush things, though.

01:34:49.665 --> 01:34:51.583
Joe Cool this time, you just watch me.

01:34:51.792 --> 01:34:52.375
Not too cool, though.

01:34:52.585 --> 01:34:54.665
I don't want him to think
I'm not interested, y'know.

01:34:55.504 --> 01:34:57.213
I'm just gonna...

01:34:57.423 --> 01:34:59.090
Be me.

01:35:00.468 --> 01:35:01.634
Whoever that is.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.600
What's up, Dad?

01:35:08.809 --> 01:35:10.685
What's the matter, mate? You're crying!

01:35:10.895 --> 01:35:13.146
Hey? What's wrong?

01:35:13.564 --> 01:35:14.981
Hey, come on.

01:35:15.191 --> 01:35:16.608
It can't be that bad,
whatever it is. Come on.

01:35:16.817 --> 01:35:19.277
It's all right, dry your eyes, come on.

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.030
Eh?

01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:24.949
Oh, don't, Dad. Please.

01:35:25.659 --> 01:35:29.204
It breaks me up to see you
like this, you know it does.

01:35:30.039 --> 01:35:31.998
There's nothing to get upset about, mate.

01:35:32.583 --> 01:35:33.917
I'm here.

01:35:34.126 --> 01:35:35.710
I'll always be here.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.088
Ok?

01:35:41.759 --> 01:35:42.967
Is it Greg?

01:35:44.303 --> 01:35:45.663
Don't you want him to come to tea?

01:35:48.766 --> 01:35:50.767
I won't. I'll stop
him, if you want me to.

01:35:50.976 --> 01:35:51.976
I've got his number.

01:35:53.771 --> 01:35:54.771
Is that it?

01:35:55.106 --> 01:35:56.439
Dad, come on, Dad.

01:35:56.649 --> 01:35:57.774
Dad, Dad, Dad.

01:35:58.401 --> 01:35:59.734
Come on, tell me.

01:35:59.944 --> 01:36:03.196
One buzz is for 'yes',
two buzzes for 'no'.

01:36:07.076 --> 01:36:09.953
Yes, you want me to cancel.

01:36:12.957 --> 01:36:14.457
No, you don't want me to?

01:36:15.459 --> 01:36:16.835
Yes.

01:36:17.044 --> 01:36:18.962
That's what I thought.

01:36:19.171 --> 01:36:21.256
You all right? You sure?

01:36:21.465 --> 01:36:22.090
Huh?

01:36:22.299 --> 01:36:24.539
Silly old bugger, getting
yourself worked up over things?

01:36:24.552 --> 01:36:27.929
Nothing to worry about, Dad. I promise.

01:36:28.139 --> 01:36:30.598
Not a worry in the world.

01:36:32.017 --> 01:36:36.312
Turned out real nice after all, didn't it?

01:36:37.106 --> 01:36:40.191
I wonder if he'll show up.

01:36:48.033 --> 01:36:52.954
♫ Somewhere deep inside
something's got a hold on you

01:36:58.210 --> 01:37:03.173
♫ And it's pushing me aside
so you stretch on forever

01:37:07.261 --> 01:37:12.223
♫ And I know I'm right for
the first time in my life

01:37:18.063 --> 01:37:23.026
♫ That's why I tell you
you'd better be home soon

01:37:30.326 --> 01:37:35.288
♫ Stripping back the cause
of lies and deception

01:37:40.294 --> 01:37:45.256
♫ Back to nothingness
like a week in the desert

01:37:48.802 --> 01:37:53.765
♫ And I know I'm for the
first time in my life

01:37:59.104 --> 01:38:04.067
♫ And that's why I tell you
you'd better be home soon

01:38:12.159 --> 01:38:17.121
♫ Don't say no don't say nothing's wrong

01:38:19.124 --> 01:38:24.087
♫ Cause when you get back
home maybe I'll be gone

01:38:54.535 --> 01:38:59.497
♫ It would cause me pain
if we were to end it

01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:08.923
♫ But I could start again
you can depend on it

01:39:12.303 --> 01:39:17.265
♫ And I know I'm right for
the first time in my life

01:39:22.646 --> 01:39:27.609
♫ And that's why I tell you
you'd better be home soon

01:39:32.781 --> 01:39:37.702
♫ That's why I tell you
you'd better be home soon ♫
