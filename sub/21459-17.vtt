00:02.836 --> 00:04.754
{\an8}(Alex)
Last summer was
pretty rough for me.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.589
{\an7}(Juliette)
In your little Alex kingdom,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.299
{\an1}you think you can just
hook up with people

00:08.383 --> 00:10.176
and that's not gonna hurt me.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.721
{\an8}(Alex)
But I learned some lessons.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.389
{\an8}When I left for law school...

00:14.472 --> 00:16.391
{\an8}Bye-bye!

00:14.472 --> 00:16.391
{\an7}Bye!

00:14.472 --> 00:16.391
{\an8}Bye!

00:16.474 --> 00:17.600
{\an8}I planned
to leave it all behind.

00:17.684 --> 00:21.730
{\an8}Look how cute Garrett is.

00:17.684 --> 00:21.730
{\an7}Big upgrade
from Alex, right?

00:21.813 --> 00:23.273
(Alex)
But at the same time,

00:23.356 --> 00:25.775
I wasn't about to let
Garrett get in the way.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.611
{\an1}It's just always gonna be hard
for us to be just friends.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.406
(Alex)
I did them both a favor.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.366
{\an5}You're willing
to try ice cream.
I'm really proud of you.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.201
I knew the way
to your heart.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.370
{\an5}(Alex)
Kelsey and Garrett
clearly still had a thing.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.456
What a slut. Oh!

00:39.539 --> 00:40.999
{\an5}(Alex)
But when Kelsey
least expected it...

00:41.082 --> 00:42.459
{\an3}Nicole.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.919
{\an5}(Alex)
Someone new caught
Garrett's attention.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.964
{\an5}You want to go
back to my place?

00:45.003 --> 00:47.964
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

00:48.047 --> 00:50.300
{\an5}(Alex)
It seemed like no one on the Key
could be trusted.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.635
{\an1}(Canvas)
I saw him leave with a girl.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.097
{\an1}You did something terrible.
I can't be with you.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.641
(Alex)
Even Paige had some secrets.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.810
If Madi knew I was sharing
drinks with you right now,

01:00.894 --> 01:02.520
she would flip.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.647
{\an5}(Alex)
I never thought
I would say this,

01:04.730 --> 01:06.232
but I became the good guy.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.151
{\an5}Did you have fun last night?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.151
{\an3}Yeah.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.653
{\an5}(Alex)
For once, I was
a one-woman man.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.781
Still, no matter
what I did,

01:12.864 --> 01:14.491
some people
weren't buying it.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.492
{\an4}(Hannah)
I don't think that
they're gonna have

01:15.575 --> 01:19.204
some Romeo and Juliet
type of relationship.

01:19.287 --> 01:22.081
{\an5}(Alex)
I really didn't want to get
in between my girlfriend

01:22.165 --> 01:23.166
and her best friend.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.667
{\an1}She's just skeptical
of the guy

01:24.751 --> 01:25.919
that's cheated on me before.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.504
(Alex)
But I had to defend myself.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.672
Coming from the girl that
cheats on her boyfriend,

01:29.756 --> 01:33.051
I'm not gonna let her
sit there and badmouth me.

01:33.134 --> 01:37.430
{\an5}(Alex)
I really love Juliette,
but I was starting to wonder

01:37.514 --> 01:40.683

{\an7}Who?

02:26.729 --> 02:28.439
{\an8}Betsy from Wilhelmina.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.941
{\an7}The agent you met with
in New York?

02:28.523 --> 02:29.941
{\an9}Yeah.

02:30.024 --> 02:33.069
{\an8}I guess she set me up
for a photoshoot here.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.237
{\an8}Oh, okay. That's big.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.237
{\an9}Yeah.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.781
{\an8}It's some brand called,
like, Cabana Life.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.908
It's a commercial brand,
so it's more, like,

02:38.992 --> 02:40.285
the pretty girl
kind of look.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.328
{\an4}Yeah.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.328
But, like,
I'm freaked out

02:42.412 --> 02:43.788
because I've never
done that before,

02:43.872 --> 02:44.747
so I'd actually be, like,
smiling and stuff,

02:44.831 --> 02:46.708
{\an5}and I'm used to
being like...

02:44.831 --> 02:46.708
{\an1}(laughs)

02:46.791 --> 02:48.751
{\an5}No. Exactly.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.751
Like, game face on.

02:48.835 --> 02:49.794
After we got back
from New York,

02:49.878 --> 02:50.920
I followed up with everyone,

02:51.004 --> 02:53.840
and Wilhelmina's the only
one I heard back from.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.049
{\an1}Really?

02:53.923 --> 02:55.049
{\an3}Yeah.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.759
It's pretty much
my test to see

02:56.843 --> 02:58.803
if I'm capable of
shooting a commercial.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.265
So, like, this is like all
stakes are on Wilhelmina.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.642
{\an5}You got it.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.642
(musical ringtone)

03:04.726 --> 03:06.686
{\an3}Who's that?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.686
{\an1}Ben.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.981
{\an8}He's from college.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.107
{\an3}Answer.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.277
{\an1}I haven't talked to him
in forever.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.612
{\an1}Hello?

03:15.695 --> 03:16.237
(Ben)
<i>Madisson.</i>

03:16.321 --> 03:18.406
{\an4}Hi, Ben.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.406
<i>What's up?</i>

03:20.366 --> 03:22.744
{\an8}I'm good. How are you?

03:30.335 --> 03:33.004
{\an7}I'm not busy.
You want to hang out?

03:34.213 --> 03:38.009
{\an8}Yeah, that'd be fun.
I'd like to see you.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.469
{\an7}Yeah.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.388
{\an7}All right.
Sounds good.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.015
<i>Awesome.</i>

03:44.098 --> 03:46.809
Aw, he sounded so nervous.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.938
He's this guy that I, like,
dated on and off in college,

03:50.021 --> 03:52.899
and I had a huge crush on him.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.359
I thought you were
with Greg in college.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.818
{\an1}Yeah, so I was.
That's also the thing.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.320
Like, the timing was
never right with Ben.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.988
But, like, who knows?
Sometimes, like,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.240
life works that way. Maybe
timing is more right now.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.743
{\an1}No. Like, I'm not, like,
I just broke up with Brandon.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.453
{\an4}Like...

04:03.826 --> 04:05.453
I know, but
sometimes it's good

04:05.536 --> 04:06.829
to, like, have
a little distraction.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.623
{\an5}Like, it doesn't hurt.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.623
Look at this puppy.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.958

{\an1}Tell me, bro,
how are you feeling?

04:30.937 --> 04:33.690
{\an7}Not good. Just been, like,
keeping my mind off Madisson

04:33.773 --> 04:35.400
by, like, working
on a lot of music, so...

04:35.483 --> 04:36.985
{\an1}Dude, that...
(sighs)

04:37.068 --> 04:38.861
{\an1}I gotta say, man,
that is so good to hear.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.031
The busier you are, you won't
have time to think about it.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.159
I got, like,
a song that's, like,

04:45.243 --> 04:47.537
dedicated towards Madisson,

04:47.620 --> 04:50.873
just, I want...
I really want her to hear.

04:50.957 --> 04:55.837
{\an1}I mean, just don't, like,
get your hopes too high

04:55.920 --> 04:59.298
{\an1}that the song is gonna change
anything drastically,

04:59.382 --> 05:00.550
{\an1}you know what I mean?
Like...

05:00.633 --> 05:02.176
I mean, you know,
I understand that.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.886
I mean, that's just where
I'm at, though, man. Like,

05:03.970 --> 05:05.013
she won't answer my texts,
she won't answer my calls.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.222
She won't even, like,
talk to me or look at me.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.641
This the only girl
that I ever

05:08.725 --> 05:09.517
cared about
in my entire life,

05:09.600 --> 05:12.937
first girl I said
"I love you" to,

05:13.021 --> 05:14.897
so, like, the only
thing I can do is, like,

05:14.981 --> 05:16.649
do what I'm naturally
talented at

05:16.733 --> 05:19.110
and write a song
that can somehow

05:19.193 --> 05:21.070
sort of change things
around, get her to see me

05:21.154 --> 05:22.739
or look at me
in a different light.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.824
{\an1}I don't want you to think
that it's gonna be like a...

05:24.907 --> 05:27.744
{\an6}Guarantee.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.744

08:05.359 --> 08:06.903
{\an8}The boat day was so fun.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.739
{\an7}I know. Paul took Paige
and I on a little adventure.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.782
{\an1}So you guys hung out
for a while, then?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.159
Yeah.
It was kind of weird.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.660
I never really talked
to either of them.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.245
That's funny.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.245
Paul, of course,

08:16.329 --> 08:18.706
is talking
about you and Alex.

08:18.789 --> 08:19.916
{\an1}Yeah.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.585
All right.
Hummus plate and plantains.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.961
{\an6}Thank you.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.961
You're welcome.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.463
{\an1}We just talked
about this yesterday.

08:25.546 --> 08:29.091
Alex is mad at you.

08:25.546 --> 08:29.091
{\an3}Me? Why?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.761
{\an1}'Cause you were talking
(bleep) about him to Paul.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.763
I was not talking crap
whatsoever.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.181
{\an5}That's not what he heard.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.181
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.933
He just got upset
and I was mad too.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.020
{\an5}I was really mad.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.020
Did Alex talk crap
about me?

08:41.102 --> 08:43.438
I don't want to tell.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.438
{\an3}What?

08:43.522 --> 08:45.816
{\an5}I don't want
to tell you.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.816
{\an3}Why?

08:45.900 --> 08:48.319
You'll get mad.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.319
{\an3}I knew it.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.030
Wait. What did he say?

08:51.113 --> 08:52.490
{\an1}He said
you were one to talk

08:52.573 --> 08:54.951
because you cheated
on your boyfriend.

08:55.034 --> 08:55.910
Are you kidding me?

08:55.993 --> 08:58.412
{\an1}You don't need to worry
about it that much.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.081
Why do people want to
ruin my relationship

09:00.164 --> 09:04.001
just 'cause their
relationships all suck?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.461
{\an1}You need to
stop talking (bleep)

09:05.544 --> 09:06.254
about my relationship.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.673
What'd I ever do
to anybody?

09:08.756 --> 09:09.215
I just try to be
a good friend to people

09:09.298 --> 09:12.802
and then I get this.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.138
Like, I'm actually
really upset.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.224
It's not gonna affect your
relationship with Andrew.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.809
{\an1}No, it's not gonna affect
my relationship with Andrew,

09:19.892 --> 09:21.978
{\an1}but it affects my
relationship with my friends

09:22.061 --> 09:23.980
'cause now I'm upset with
you that you would not,

09:24.063 --> 09:26.315
like, do anything
when Alex was saying it.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.650
What am I supposed to do?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.860
Or you went, like, "I know
she wouldn't do that"

09:29.944 --> 09:31.821
or anything
along those lines.

09:31.904 --> 09:35.491
{\an1}Of course,
it's, like, my fault.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.368

09:48.212 --> 09:49.880
I attacked
her relationship,

09:49.964 --> 09:51.841
it was personal.
She was gonna do

was in Dallas.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.458
{\an1}I know. What have you
been up to, like,

11:49.542 --> 11:51.335
{\an5}since you graduated?

Working, traveling,

and having fun.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.587
{\an1}Yeah?

11:53.671 --> 11:55.005
I just had a job interview

11:55.089 --> 11:56.674
{\an5}with a commercial
real estate firm...

11:55.089 --> 11:56.674
{\an1}Oh, wow.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.759
and I really
liked them, so...

11:58.843 --> 11:59.635
{\an5}So that's why you're here?

11:58.843 --> 11:59.635
{\an3}Yep.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.471
Weren't you, like,
in Greece recently?

12:02.555 --> 12:04.807
Yeah. We did Yacht Week
over the summer.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.808
{\an5}It was a lot of fun.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.808
Oh, my God.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.017
There were, like, 20 boats,

12:07.101 --> 12:08.102
and you just, like,
travel and,

12:08.185 --> 12:09.186
like, island hop
pretty much.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.813
{\an5}Oh, my gosh.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.813
It's pretty cool.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.648
{\an1}What a life!

12:12.731 --> 12:15.109
It's a pretty
good one, so...

12:15.192 --> 12:17.069
{\an1}How many shoes did you
pack for this trip?

12:17.153 --> 12:17.820
(laughs)
Just for...

12:17.903 --> 12:18.654
Well, I'm here
for four days,

12:18.737 --> 12:20.823
so I have
five pairs of shoes.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.324
Oh, my God!

12:22.408 --> 12:23.993
You never know if
you need an extra.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.412
{\an1}'Cause last time I saw you,
like, senior year,

12:26.495 --> 12:28.706
{\an1}you had, like,
racks and racks of shoes,

12:28.789 --> 12:31.292
{\an5}and that was just...

12:28.789 --> 12:31.292
A few hundred.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.042
{\an5}at your college...

12:31.375 --> 12:32.042
But I don't know how many.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.836
{\an1}...like, apartment.
Oh, my God!

12:33.919 --> 12:35.045
I don't really
keep up anymore.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.213
I could have
worse problems

12:36.297 --> 12:38.215
than being
addicted to shoes.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.633
{\an1}Than a shoe...
a shoe addiction?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.594
{\an3}Cheers.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.594
{\an1}Cheers.

12:41.677 --> 12:45.347
{\an1}Thanks for
inviting me out.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.516
Thanks for coming.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.516
{\an1}Of course.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.437
{\an1}I remember the first time
you took me on a date.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.148
{\an1}And it was, like,
my birthday.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.400
{\an5}Do you remember?

12:54.231 --> 12:56.400
Yeah.
In freshman year.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.861
{\an1}Yeah, it was
freshman year.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.613
It's like I'm reliving it.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.656
{\an3}(laughs)

13:04.325 --> 13:06.785
So, have you been
single since Dallas?

13:06.869 --> 13:09.163
(laughs) No.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.163
{\an3}No?

13:09.246 --> 13:10.122
Um, no, not at all.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.542
Uh-oh. This feels like
a story coming on.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.169
(laughs) Yeah.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.630
{\an1}I met this guy at the beginning
of the summer-- Brandon.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.632
{\an1}Um, things were
going really well

13:19.715 --> 13:23.928
{\an1}the whole summer,
but, um...

13:24.011 --> 13:28.682
{\an1}So, I found out that
he cheated on me, so...

13:28.766 --> 13:30.267
Well, that's no good.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.228
{\an1}Yeah. So that
was the end of us, so...

13:32.311 --> 13:33.646
That was the end?

13:32.311 --> 13:33.646
{\an1}Yeah.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.441
Are you single now, though?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.486
{\an1}Yeah.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.486
{\an3}Yeah?

13:40.569 --> 13:43.030
{\an1}Definitely.
I am very single.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.574

the single life, are you?

13:50.162 --> 13:52.498
I'm working on it.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.498

14:54.727 --> 14:57.146
{\an1}And this will be...
I would set up a little bar

14:57.229 --> 14:58.814
and whatever else.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.483
{\an5}That'll be, like,
the man cave.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.483
That's awesome.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.485
You think you're gonna be
all moved in by the party?

15:03.569 --> 15:06.071
Um, that's the plan.

15:06.155 --> 15:10.701
{\an1}So, can I invite Hannah
to this housewarming party?

15:10.784 --> 15:12.828
{\an1}Yeah, if she can
keep her mouth shut.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.581
Well, she's kind of mad
at both of us right now.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.335
{\an1}Oh, great.

15:15.664 --> 15:19.335
{\an3}So...

15:19.418 --> 15:21.337
In the hot tub,
you kind of, like,

15:21.420 --> 15:23.297
got a little angry
about her

15:23.380 --> 15:24.715
and, like,
said all those things

15:24.798 --> 15:26.383
about her relationship
with Andrew.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.344
She got really upset,
and now,

15:28.427 --> 15:31.180
she's, like, mad at you,
and she's mad at me

15:31.263 --> 15:32.848
{\an5}because of you.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.848
{\an1}Okay, well,
I don't know why

15:32.931 --> 15:35.351
you felt the need
to tell her that.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.810
I just want, like,
the air to be clear

15:36.894 --> 15:39.188
{\an5}between you two.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.188
{\an1}She's the one
who started it.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.273
I'm a (bleep) liar.
I can't just...

15:41.357 --> 15:43.192
Well, I'm not saying...
You don't need to lie.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.235
{\an1}I mean, obviously, I was mad.
I literally heard

15:45.319 --> 15:46.528
{\an1}that we went out
on the boat

15:46.612 --> 15:48.072
and she sat there
and badmouthed me.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.365
{\an1}Like, how would you
feel about it?

15:49.448 --> 15:50.908
I just think, like,
we don't need

15:50.991 --> 15:52.368
to take it any further.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.369
{\an1}I know I put you
in a bad situation

15:53.452 --> 15:54.953
{\an5}by, like...

15:53.452 --> 15:54.953
Yeah, but you know
that, like,

15:55.037 --> 15:57.373
two rights
don't make a wrong.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.625
{\an1}Two wrongs don't
make a right.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.378
Only two people can date.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.213
{\an1}Here we are,
trying this again.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.422
It just sucks
to see Hannah

16:05.506 --> 16:07.132
try to get between
our relationship.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.096
{\an5}(Alex)
It wasn't fair that Juliette
got caught in the middle,

16:12.179 --> 16:15.599
but it was looking like
she'd have to pick a side,

16:15.683 --> 16:19.061
even if it meant
losing one of us.

are you ready?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.051
{\an1}And I think also
a little walk towards.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.386
Big step forward.

{\an1}Not a hop with the face,
though.

{\an1}Okay.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.103
{\an3}Sorry.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.063
(Richard)
Just relax your mouth.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.607
Again, relax your mouth.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.233
{\an1}Ooh, that one's
super stiff.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.737
{\an1}I feel like she's definitely
better when she's moving,

17:09.819 --> 17:10.945
{\an1}'cause she's got that,
like, runway thing going,

17:11.029 --> 17:13.781
{\an1}and, you know,
when she's trying to pose,

17:13.866 --> 17:15.367
{\an1}I feel like
we're losing something.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.621
{\an5}(Richard)
All right, let's do it
again. On three, two, one.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.790
{\an1}That's a little much,
I think.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.751
(Richard)
Shall we do some swim?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.502
{\an4}(Melissa)
Yeah, we could do that.
Okay.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.128

get a little touch-up?

{\an4}(Melissa)
Hey, Kelsey,
do you have a sec?

17:36.805 --> 17:39.183
I know you came from more of,
like, a runway world, right?

17:39.266 --> 17:44.021
{\an1}This is a completely
different world than runway.

17:44.104 --> 17:46.482
Tell me. Like, I'd rather
have the criticism and...

17:46.565 --> 17:47.316
Okay, I will.

17:47.399 --> 17:51.445
I'm just very
out of my element.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.654
On that note,
let's do the next look.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.948
All righty.
Here you go.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.744
(Richard)
Let's see what you can do.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.162
{\an8}It's gonna be, like,
a little bit more edgy.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.372
{\an8}Yeah, I mean, we can play
around a bit more

18:02.456 --> 18:04.416
{\an8}and have fun with that.
Perfect.

you can see the print more.

{\an7}Yeah, so it's been
pretty tough.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.149
{\an8}Have you talked
to your mom?

19:08.063 --> 19:11.149
{\an7}Yeah.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.068
{\an1}It was, like,
the most emotional thing

19:13.151 --> 19:15.904
{\an1}I've ever done
in my entire life.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.908
{\an1}It was just like this big
weight lifted off my chest.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.076
{\an1}I don't have time
to feel that way anymore.

19:21.159 --> 19:24.580
{\an1}Like, just because
of my sexuality, like,

19:24.663 --> 19:25.998
{\an1}none of you are gonna
even talk to me?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.708
Like, this is 2017.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.584
That's really important
for you to realize,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.252
because I know
you did have, like,

19:30.335 --> 19:33.172
{\an5}trouble coming
to that conclusion.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.172
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.089
Like, you did want
your family to approve,

19:34.173 --> 19:36.383
and, like,
I think eventually,

19:36.466 --> 19:38.760
{\an1}you will get that approval,
but right now, like,

19:38.844 --> 19:42.431
you do need to, like,
focus on yourself.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.765
{\an1}I agree.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.601
{\an1}Enough about me.
How's Brandon?

19:45.684 --> 19:48.478
Oh, wait. No.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.231
{\an5}Ben now, right?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.231

19:51.315 --> 19:52.774

19:52.858 --> 19:55.402

{\an3}(groans)

19:55.485 --> 19:56.612
Well, Brandon, I mean,

19:56.695 --> 19:58.113
I still haven't talked
to him, like,

19:58.196 --> 20:01.241
{\an5}since we officially
broke it off.

19:58.196 --> 20:01.241
{\an1}Okay.

20:01.325 --> 20:05.162
And, like, those feelings
are still fresh.

20:05.245 --> 20:08.290
Ben is, like,
something that...

20:08.373 --> 20:13.962
He's a distraction.
Like, it just...

20:14.046 --> 20:15.756
Like, rethinking
those memories

20:15.839 --> 20:18.550
over and over,
it's like...

20:18.634 --> 20:19.509
{\an1}Do you remember that day
at the tennis court

20:19.593 --> 20:23.472
{\an1}when I told you that
his type likes to cheat?

20:23.555 --> 20:26.099
Tarik, I don't need an
"I told you so" right now.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.810
I'm not saying
I told you so.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.813
I'm not saying it,
but I'm saying it.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.231
I'm excited to meet Ben.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.526
You'll really like him,
maybe too much, but...

20:36.610 --> 20:37.819
I'm thinking
about bringing him

20:37.903 --> 20:40.864
to Alex' housewarming.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.658
{\an5}Brandon's gonna be there.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.658
{\an3}Exactly.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.534
{\an1}You need to stick this
in his face,

20:44.618 --> 20:45.827
{\an1}'cause that's
what he deserves.

20:45.911 --> 20:46.662

22:36.063 --> 22:37.773
{\an9}Yes.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.773

22:37.856 --> 22:39.900

22:46.865 --> 22:48.450

I just don't really know
how to tell you this

22:51.411 --> 22:54.164
{\an1}'cause I don't think you're
gonna be thrilled about this.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.876
Um, I've, like, kind of been

22:57.959 --> 23:00.670
hanging out with Canvas,
actually.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.008
{\an1}Why?

23:03.256 --> 23:05.008
{\an3}Uh...

23:05.092 --> 23:07.803
{\an1}Like, after the tiki bar,
she wanted to meet up again

23:07.886 --> 23:09.096
so I could, like,
hear her out

23:09.179 --> 23:10.097
and listen to
her side of the story,

23:10.180 --> 23:13.809
and, like, so we did,
and I think that she

23:13.892 --> 23:15.894
actually was coming
from, like, a good place

23:15.977 --> 23:17.312
and she genuinely
wanted you to know

23:17.395 --> 23:19.564
she didn't do it
to hurt you, you know?

23:19.648 --> 23:20.690
I know that it sucks
how it happened,

23:20.774 --> 23:23.485
but, I mean, you've got to
admit, like, in the end,

23:23.568 --> 23:25.445
what she did was, like,
the right thing, right?

23:25.529 --> 23:28.824
And I know this totally
sucks, hearing this,

23:28.907 --> 23:30.992
{\an1}but I'm telling you, 'cause,
like, I don't want to

23:31.076 --> 23:32.035
hide this from you
and also 'cause, like,

23:32.119 --> 23:33.495
I kind of want to keep
hanging out with her.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.540
{\an1}Okay, what does that mean,
like, hanging out?

23:36.623 --> 23:40.085
I mean, it's like a little
bit more than hanging out.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.130
I don't know.
I think she's really cool.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.341
{\an5}I really like her.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.341
Like, romantically like her?

23:46.424 --> 23:47.384
I don't know. We just
kind of, like, clicked.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.719
I'm sorry. I just,
like, don't get it.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.389
So, you went and met
with her and, like,

23:52.472 --> 23:56.184
heard her out, and then
now you click with her?

23:56.268 --> 23:59.688
We've also gone together
and had brunch. Like...

23:59.771 --> 24:01.565
Are you kidding me?
So, you've hung out

24:01.648 --> 24:03.859
{\an1}with this girl now
two times,

24:03.942 --> 24:06.069
{\an1}who nothing good
has come from?

24:06.153 --> 24:07.779
{\an1}Like, she's the girl
who tried

24:07.863 --> 24:09.322
{\an1}to ruin me and
Brandon's relationship.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.782
Brandon is the one who
ruined your relationship.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.617
Yeah, but she sure tried.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.786
Like, she wanted
to sleep with him

24:14.870 --> 24:16.163
{\an1}and then he went home
with someone else.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.789
Again, not Canvas' fault.
Like...

24:17.873 --> 24:19.791
{\an1}I don't understand,
because clearly this girl

24:19.875 --> 24:21.751
{\an1}does not have the best
intentions,

24:21.835 --> 24:23.795
{\an1}and you go
and you hang out with her

24:23.879 --> 24:26.006
and then start dating her?

24:26.089 --> 24:27.883
I'm really sorry.
I didn't, like, plan this.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.885
Yeah, yeah. Have fun
following your heart.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.056

{\an1}I don't particularly
want to see her, either,

So, I'm in just as weird

25:06.838 --> 25:08.173
of a situation,
if not weirder,

25:08.256 --> 25:09.925

25:10.008 --> 25:12.969
It's super awkward.

I might come for
the amusement of that.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.599
{\an1}Bringing Ben shows, like,
you're doing your own thing.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.977
{\an1}Yeah, and, like,
I need to start moving on

25:21.061 --> 25:23.855
{\an5}and I need to start...

25:21.061 --> 25:23.855

gonna be there tonight.

25:23.939 --> 25:28.276
{\an3}Yeah.

I know, it's crazy.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.242
{\an1}You can just be there
in case things get weird.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.785

for moral support.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.453

{\an1}You can't be wearing
glasses to this party.

25:41.915 --> 25:45.377
{\an5}Are you calling
my glasses ugly?

25:41.915 --> 25:45.377

I'm not sure. I haven't,
like, reached out to him.

Like, I know where I
stand, but I don't know

25:59.182 --> 26:02.018

with everything.

I know, and, like,
I was gonna talk to him,

is kind of a signal?

29:21.926 --> 29:23.845
I don't know if he's
ever gonna trust me again

29:23.928 --> 29:24.762
after, like, what I did.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.599
{\an1}But the only way
you're gonna find out

29:27.682 --> 29:28.892
{\an1}if he's gonna be able
to trust you again

29:28.975 --> 29:31.728
{\an1}is if you talk to him.
I mean, Garrett's a great guy.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.688
{\an1}Like, you can't blame him
for hanging with other girls.

29:33.771 --> 29:35.482
{\an1}It's not every day he posts
a photo with a girl.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.860
{\an1}Kelsey, you need to tell him how
you feel before it's too late.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.904
I don't know.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.781
{\an5}(Alex)
Even I had seen Garrett's post
with this new girl.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.784
It looked like
Garrett had moved on

29:46.868 --> 29:50.079

up for a big letdown.

Yo, um, I need you
to tell me, bro,

31:46.863 --> 31:49.115
{\an1}what's up with this Ben dude

{\an1}Yeah.

31:55.705 --> 31:56.831
{\an5}'Cause that's my girl.

31:55.705 --> 31:56.831
Was your girl.

31:56.914 --> 31:59.125
I'm not going
into depth with you.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.252
I just want to know what's
up with Ben? Who is he?

32:01.336 --> 32:02.503
{\an1}You want me to be
short about it?

32:02.587 --> 32:03.254
Man, take it however
you want to take it.

32:03.338 --> 32:06.633
{\an1}All right.
He's cool as (bleep).

32:06.716 --> 32:08.009
{\an5}He has a good job.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.009
Oh, he has a good job?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.886
{\an5}He's not a musician.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.886
He's not a musician?

32:09.969 --> 32:11.679
{\an1}He's not a musician.
Madisson's good.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.806
Is that good enough for you?

32:13.890 --> 32:15.183
{\an5}Madisson's happy right now.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.183
{\an3}Is she?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.852
{\an5}Yes, she's happy.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.852
You're Madisson?
You know if she's happy?

32:17.935 --> 32:19.771
{\an1}No, she's actually
happy right now.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.522
{\an1}She's happy that
she doesn't have to worry

32:21.606 --> 32:23.024
{\an1}about someone
(bleep) her over.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.859
I messed up, man.
Of course I did.

32:24.942 --> 32:26.694
Listen, everyone's
already told me that.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.862
{\an5}You cheated on her.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.862
Shut up, bro.

32:27.945 --> 32:29.030
{\an1}In public,
in front of everyone.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.115
You sound like you're
trying to dig it in.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.409
Like, what do you
want me to say?

32:33.493 --> 32:34.911
You came up to me.

32:37.288 --> 32:41.834
{\an1}I get it, but I want to know,
what am I supposed to do?

32:41.918 --> 32:43.086
{\an5}I see her here with Ben.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.086
What are you supposed to do?

32:43.169 --> 32:45.463
{\an5}What do you want me to do?

32:43.169 --> 32:45.463
This is gonna sound bad,

32:45.546 --> 32:46.422
{\an1}but, like, Brandon,
she's, like...

32:46.506 --> 32:48.758
she's over you.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.016
Oh, I refuse
to believe that.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.728
Okay. I mean, yeah.

33:04.691 --> 33:08.069
{\an5}(Alex)
I already knew it was impossible
to win back Madisson's heart,

33:08.152 --> 33:12.156
but Brandon was gonna
learn that the hard way.

33:27.630 --> 33:28.673
{\an8}Are you enjoying
the festivities?

33:28.756 --> 33:30.550

33:30.633 --> 33:31.551
{\an5}Cheers to that.

{\an3}Cheers.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.386
{\an5}(Hannah)
I don't know
if you could tell.

33:33.469 --> 33:35.096
{\an8}I mean, I've been kind
of sad and depressed.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.014
{\an8}Can you tell?

33:35.179 --> 33:37.014
{\an8}Yeah, I would know.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.809
I try to, like,
put on a show and, like,

33:39.892 --> 33:41.602
try to act happy,
but I feel

33:41.686 --> 33:43.980
honestly betrayed
by Juliette

33:44.063 --> 33:47.817
and how, like, what she
did to me with Alex.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.610
{\an8}And if Juliette's
not gonna defend me,

33:49.694 --> 33:51.946
{\an8}I'm gonna defend myself.

33:52.029 --> 33:54.323
{\an1}Cheers to a great party.
This has been a great turnout.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.783
{\an8}Hi.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.783
{\an9}Hey.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.783
{\an7}Hello.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.077
{\an8}What's up?
Hi, Paul.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.077
{\an5}Good to see you.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.204
Well, I think I might let
you two talk

34:00.288 --> 34:02.248
and I might take a stroll
and get another drink.

34:02.331 --> 34:06.294
{\an4}We're at the bar.
I mean...

34:02.331 --> 34:06.294
(clears throat)

34:06.377 --> 34:09.964
Anyway, first of all,
I can't even believe

34:10.047 --> 34:12.216
{\an1}that you would listen
to what Paul had to say.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.426
Number one, it wasn't
the first time

34:13.509 --> 34:15.052
{\an1}that you've talked about
Juliette and I's relationship.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.304
{\an1}How do you think
I'm supposed to feel

34:17.388 --> 34:18.806
{\an1}when Juliette tells me
you guys are dating?

34:18.889 --> 34:20.099
{\an1}I mean, I would
never want

34:20.183 --> 34:21.601
{\an1}a boyfriend
to be how you...

34:21.684 --> 34:22.435
Oh, you and Andrew?

34:21.684 --> 34:22.435
{\an1}Yes.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.687
Your relationship,
by all means,

34:24.771 --> 34:28.649
is totally rocky.

34:24.771 --> 34:28.649
{\an1}We're...

34:28.733 --> 34:29.734
You guys are faithful?

34:28.733 --> 34:29.734
{\an1}Like...

34:29.817 --> 34:33.654
That's... We...

34:33.737 --> 34:36.157
{\an4}I'm not even gonna
say, like...

34:33.737 --> 34:36.157
{\an3}Hmm.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.034
{\an1}Whatever. Like, I mean,
our relationship

34:38.117 --> 34:39.659
{\an1}is a lot different
than your relationship.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.996
{\an3}How so?

34:42.079 --> 34:43.039
{\an1}When Juliette
comes to my apartment

34:43.121 --> 34:45.500
{\an1}every single weekend,
crying,

34:45.583 --> 34:47.752
{\an1}it's very uncomfortable
for me.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.628
Bottom line is,
if you're her friend,

34:48.710 --> 34:50.880
you'll be supportive
for her, and if...

34:50.963 --> 34:52.215
And I am completely
supportive of her.

34:52.297 --> 34:54.382
{\an5}Okay, well, then
respect the fact...

34:52.297 --> 34:54.382
But, Alex...

34:54.467 --> 34:56.302
{\an5}that she
wants me, and...

34:54.467 --> 34:56.302
No, that's fine,

34:56.385 --> 34:58.429
{\an1}but I don't appreciate
you two talking

34:58.513 --> 35:00.348
{\an5}behind my back, starting...

34:58.513 --> 35:00.348
I don't talk!
You started it!

35:00.431 --> 35:02.725
{\an5}You started it!

35:00.431 --> 35:02.725
...rumor after rumor.

35:02.809 --> 35:03.518
{\an1}I didn't start a rumor
about myself.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.311
100%.
So you talked (bleep)

35:05.394 --> 35:07.230
about Juliette
and I's relationship.

35:07.313 --> 35:10.066
I caught wind of it for
the second, third time.

35:10.149 --> 35:13.110
From Paul, who you know
is a pathological liar.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.905
Well, let's back it up.
You assume things...

35:15.988 --> 35:17.865
Speak of the devil.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.865
{\an3}Hi.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.116
{\an5}What are you guys
talking about?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.116
{\an1}You.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.244
{\an5}That's what I figured.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.244
Well, he told me

35:21.327 --> 35:24.121
{\an1}to not get mad about,
like, your ex's situation.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.540
{\an1}I said, okay,
then tell your girlfriend

35:25.623 --> 35:27.208
{\an5}to not tell me anything.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.208
No, what I said was...

35:27.291 --> 35:30.294
{\an5}Tell you what?

35:27.291 --> 35:30.294
...if she respects you

35:30.378 --> 35:32.296
and really cares for you,
that she...

35:32.380 --> 35:34.549
{\an1}If I respected you,
I would make sure

35:34.632 --> 35:36.467
{\an1}you have respect
for yourself.

35:39.136 --> 35:41.722
{\an1}You're running your (bleep)
mouth when I'm not there.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.558
It puts a burden
on our relationship,

35:43.641 --> 35:48.563
and clearly you've got
some things to deal with.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.356
That was totally
a home run.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.484
{\an1}Goodbye.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.905
Uh, Juliette,
what's going on?

35:57.989 --> 35:58.781
{\an5}No, don't be upset.

35:57.989 --> 35:58.781
She's mean.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.491
No, don't be upset.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.369
(Alex)
I'm (bleep) over it.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.332
{\an5}It's not worth it, Jules.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.332
It's really not.

36:08.416 --> 36:11.669
You just screamed that
I don't respect myself.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.421
Months ago, when you would
come to my apartment

36:13.504 --> 36:15.923
{\an1}every single weekend and
talk to me and my roommates

36:16.007 --> 36:18.050
and my friends that
you were upset, Juliette.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.302
{\an8}But that's the thing is,

36:19.385 --> 36:21.429
{\an8}you guys need to stop
bringing it up.

36:23.306 --> 36:26.100
{\an1}I stuck up for you, okay?
I seriously stuck up for you.

36:26.183 --> 36:28.436
He just wants to take
the drama away from him

36:28.519 --> 36:29.770
and put it on towards me

36:29.854 --> 36:30.771
because of what he does
to you, and, like...

36:30.855 --> 36:33.274
{\an1}Well, you know what would
make me really happy

36:33.357 --> 36:34.025
is if you and him
stopped fighting.

36:34.108 --> 36:35.359
I'm not fighting with him.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.237
That's all that matters,
Jules, and, like I said,

36:38.321 --> 36:39.906
as long as you've
moved past it...

36:39.989 --> 36:40.948
What you say to Juliette
has an effect.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.241
Like, I literally
had no idea.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.952
{\an1}I'm just saying...
Well, obviously, like,

36:45.036 --> 36:46.954
{\an1}don't you take what I
have to say into any...

36:47.038 --> 36:48.456
