00:03.342 --> 00:07.487
Previously, on The Truth About
the Harry Quebert Affair...

00:11.023 --> 00:12.902
In America,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:12.904 --> 00:15.475
we are obsessed
with sex and morality.

00:15.477 --> 00:16.818
Excuse me, why, uh...

00:16.820 --> 00:18.854
why are blowjobs bad?

00:18.856 --> 00:20.275
I'm just, personally,
I'm a big fan, I don't know...

00:21.429 --> 00:23.346
You're the reason
I'm here, Professor.

00:23.348 --> 00:25.305
You're what I aspire to be, sir.

00:25.307 --> 00:28.108
Well, Mr. Goldman,
I have no doubt

00:28.110 --> 00:30.182
that you're going to be
a huge success.

00:34.369 --> 00:35.673
I'm totally blocked, Harry.

00:35.675 --> 00:36.633
It's been over a year,

00:36.635 --> 00:38.054
<i>and I got nothing.</i>

00:38.056 --> 00:39.360
You know,
why don't you come to me?

00:39.362 --> 00:40.435
You made it!

00:40.437 --> 00:41.280
- How are you, man?
- Ah, good to see you!

00:48.846 --> 00:50.573
What, are you
spying on me, Marcus?

00:50.575 --> 00:53.567
This needs to stay between us.

00:53.569 --> 00:55.717
<i>Author Harry Quebert
was arrested today</i>

00:55.719 --> 00:57.446
<i>after police
discovered the body</i>

00:57.448 --> 01:00.633
<i>of 15-year-old Nola Kellergan,</i>

01:00.635 --> 01:03.436
<i>who disappeared from her house
in August of 1975.</i>

01:03.438 --> 01:04.819
How's it looking for him?

01:04.821 --> 01:06.047
Not good.

01:06.049 --> 01:08.812
They found a manuscript
of his "Origin of Evil"

01:08.814 --> 01:10.579
buried with
the dead girl.

01:10.581 --> 01:12.076
Talk to
the nice townsfolk.

01:12.078 --> 01:14.227
Those hicks are
potential witnesses.

01:14.229 --> 01:16.300
Hey, we're gonna get
you out of here, okay?

01:16.302 --> 01:18.374
Is there anything
you haven't told me?

01:18.376 --> 01:19.949
I was supposed
to meet Nola at 8:00.

01:19.951 --> 01:22.559
<i>That was the night
she disappeared.</i>

01:22.561 --> 01:24.288
It's a fucking
disaster!

01:24.290 --> 01:25.747
If the prosecution
gets hold of this,

01:25.749 --> 01:27.669
Harry is screwed.

01:28.706 --> 01:31.238
<i>"On my desk,
there's a porcelain pot.</i>

01:31.240 --> 01:33.542
<i>Inside is a key to my locker
at the gym in Montburry.</i>

01:33.544 --> 01:35.463
<i>Everything is in there..."</i>

01:36.270 --> 01:38.382
It's "The Origin of Evil."

01:39.496 --> 01:41.452
It's Harry's
original manuscript.

01:41.454 --> 01:43.027
<i>"...Burn it all.</i>

01:43.029 --> 01:44.948
<i>I'm in danger."</i>

03:01.172 --> 03:03.093
Thank you.

03:04.168 --> 03:05.011
Hey.

03:05.013 --> 03:05.971
Hey.

03:05.973 --> 03:07.353
Did you burn everything?

03:07.355 --> 03:08.581
And the manuscript?

03:08.583 --> 03:11.193
Yes, I did exactly
what you told me.

03:11.195 --> 03:13.115
Thank you.

03:14.536 --> 03:16.609
Why was that box
in your gym locker?

03:19.643 --> 03:21.446
I was afraid someone
else might find it,

03:21.448 --> 03:23.289
so I just... panicked.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.209
I thought it would be
safe somewhere else.

03:25.211 --> 03:27.052
You thought it would be safe?

03:27.054 --> 03:30.508
Mm, just makes you
look guilty, that's all.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.083
Do you think
I'm guilty, Marcus?

03:32.085 --> 03:33.849
No, Harry.
I don't.

03:33.851 --> 03:36.575
I loved her, Marcus,
but it was innocent.

03:36.577 --> 03:39.532
I never
crossed that line.

03:39.534 --> 03:43.298
And I did not kill her.

03:48.327 --> 03:49.362
The, um...

03:49.364 --> 03:52.857
the manuscript
was "The Origin of Evil."

03:52.859 --> 03:54.278
The very first draft.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.084
How come
there was no title

03:55.086 --> 03:56.044
on the cover page?

03:56.046 --> 03:58.732
The title came afterwards.

03:58.734 --> 04:00.499
After... after Nola's
disappearance, you mean?

04:00.501 --> 04:01.651
Yeah, but I don't want

04:01.653 --> 04:03.225
to talk about
the manuscript.

04:03.227 --> 04:05.606
It's brought nothing
but suffering into my life.

04:05.608 --> 04:07.528
Okay.

04:08.334 --> 04:10.444
Oh, for Christ's sake.

04:10.446 --> 04:11.365
You still have that?

04:11.367 --> 04:12.633
Yeah, it's
a good luck charm.

04:12.635 --> 04:13.862
Huh.

04:13.864 --> 04:15.859
It was a gift from
the great Harry Quebert

04:15.861 --> 04:18.086
back when I was
a fledgling non-writer.

04:18.088 --> 04:19.968
Marcus, please
put it away.

04:19.970 --> 04:21.889
I want you to tell me
about Nola.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.999
Who she was.

04:26.613 --> 04:27.954
I need to know
everything, Harry,

04:27.956 --> 04:29.877
if we're gonna get
you out of here.

04:30.683 --> 04:32.603
Ahh...

04:41.397 --> 04:43.890
I don't wanna
go back there, Marcus.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.120
I know you don't,
but you need to.

04:48.501 --> 04:51.724
Well, where shall I begin?

04:51.726 --> 04:55.567
From the beginning.

04:57.332 --> 05:01.362
<i>It was an afternoon
in June, 1975.</i>

05:01.364 --> 05:03.014
<i>I'd been struggling
up to that point</i>

05:03.016 --> 05:05.280
<i>to get started on the book,</i>

05:05.282 --> 05:07.123
<i>and I looked up,</i>

05:07.125 --> 05:10.732
<i>right when the rain
started, and...</i>

05:10.734 --> 05:13.305
<i>there she was,</i>

05:13.307 --> 05:16.340
<i>just dancing,
enjoying the rain.</i>

05:18.607 --> 05:20.526
<i>I was just lost watching her.</i>

05:22.984 --> 05:25.862
<i>That was
the first time I met her.</i>

05:28.130 --> 05:29.740
She had a magical quality
about her,

05:29.742 --> 05:31.161
something...

05:31.163 --> 05:33.083
I'd never seen before.

05:34.964 --> 05:37.421
I remember asking her
what her name was,

05:37.423 --> 05:40.223
and it wasn't until...

05:40.225 --> 05:42.489
maybe a week later

05:42.491 --> 05:45.832
that I...
I ran into her in town.

05:48.328 --> 05:51.359
<i>I was in the middle
of my morning run,</i>

05:51.361 --> 05:52.933
<i>and she appeared once again.</i>

05:52.935 --> 05:54.547
Harry!

05:54.549 --> 05:56.546
Oh, hey! Hello!

06:00.654 --> 06:01.497
Hi!

06:01.499 --> 06:02.265
Guess what?

06:02.267 --> 06:03.186
Hey, Nola!

06:03.957 --> 06:04.800
Hey, hi!

06:04.802 --> 06:06.182
Guess what?

06:06.184 --> 06:07.142
What?

06:07.144 --> 06:08.179
I checked out
your book yesterday

06:08.181 --> 06:08.947
out of the library.

06:08.949 --> 06:09.753
Uh-huh?

06:09.755 --> 06:10.867
"The Mirror of Life"?

06:10.869 --> 06:11.981
You're the only "Q"
in Fiction,

06:11.983 --> 06:13.554
right between
Boris Pasternak

06:13.556 --> 06:14.783
and Ayn Rand.

06:14.785 --> 06:16.088
What, no, uh...

06:16.090 --> 06:18.623
Pope, no Poe,
no Proust?

06:18.625 --> 06:20.082
Well, the collection
at the Sommerdale Library

06:20.084 --> 06:21.580
isn't exactly
extensive.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.462
Ah...

06:23.464 --> 06:24.268
Isn't it exciting?

06:24.270 --> 06:26.420
Yes,
uh, very exciting.

06:27.995 --> 06:28.953
It must be wonderful

06:28.955 --> 06:30.681
to be taken seriously
as a writer,

06:30.683 --> 06:33.868
to be told your words
are worth publishing.

06:33.870 --> 06:37.555
Like you weren't
crazy to dream.

06:37.557 --> 06:41.318
Uh, yeah, well, um...

06:41.320 --> 06:44.927
success and fame
can be gratifying,

06:44.929 --> 06:47.884
I'll admit that, but...

06:47.886 --> 06:49.573
I don't know,
all the other stuff is...

06:49.575 --> 06:51.725
like, the parties and...

06:51.727 --> 06:53.260
that stuff's
overrated.

06:53.262 --> 06:54.835
I don't believe you.

06:54.837 --> 06:56.025
That's why I came
here, you know,

06:56.027 --> 06:57.446
to get away
from it all,

06:57.448 --> 06:59.790
to find some
inspiration.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.245
Well, this is me.

07:03.247 --> 07:05.357
- I work here on Saturdays.
- Okay.

07:05.359 --> 07:07.161
You should, uh, come by.

07:07.163 --> 07:09.772
Maybe it will inspire you.

07:09.774 --> 07:10.848
Okay.

07:10.850 --> 07:12.153
And I'll sneak you
a free plate of fries.

07:13.038 --> 07:15.493
- Possibly.
- Okay.

07:15.495 --> 07:17.416
See you, Nola.

07:18.991 --> 07:20.601
<i>And then I...</i>

07:20.603 --> 07:24.403
found myself thinking
about her more and more,

07:24.405 --> 07:26.169
just consuming my thoughts.

07:26.171 --> 07:28.091
Mm-hm.

07:55.701 --> 07:57.620
Nola?

07:58.735 --> 07:59.615
Are you okay?

07:59.617 --> 08:00.845
- Yes, yes, yes...
- What happened?

08:00.847 --> 08:01.843
Yes, I'm... I'm fine!

08:03.803 --> 08:05.222
Shh... Shh!

08:05.224 --> 08:06.144
Can you help me?

08:06.146 --> 08:07.142
Yes, I'll help you.

08:07.144 --> 08:08.678
Okay, I'll get the...
I'll get the broom.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.060
Yeah, I think that...
Oh, my gosh.

08:13.595 --> 08:14.860
We shouldn't
be laughing!

08:14.862 --> 08:16.166
No, it's fine.

08:16.168 --> 08:17.779
If she finds out,
she's gonna fire me.

08:17.781 --> 08:19.122
She's not gonna fire you.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.158
You're, like, the best
waitress she's got anyway.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.578
Oh, my goodness,
look at this mess.

08:23.810 --> 08:24.960
Well, it's a good thing
they come for the burgers

08:24.962 --> 08:26.802
and not the service.

08:26.804 --> 08:28.454
Hmm, although, I just wish
someone would tell me,

08:28.456 --> 08:30.642
whenever I order
just a simple cup of coffee,

08:30.644 --> 08:33.100
I am presented with
every, like, condiment

08:33.102 --> 08:34.212
known to mankind.

08:35.445 --> 08:38.284
That's because
it has been decreed

08:38.285 --> 08:39.859
by the mistress
of the inn.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.702
Who?

08:41.703 --> 08:42.931
Mrs. Quinn.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.236
Mrs. Quinn?

08:44.238 --> 08:45.657
As you will
have noticed, ladies,

08:45.659 --> 08:46.924
for the past week,

08:46.926 --> 08:49.305
the famous New York writer,
Mr. Harry Quebert,

08:49.307 --> 08:51.264
has been coming here every day,

08:51.266 --> 08:52.492
which means

08:52.494 --> 08:54.297
he sees in our restaurant

08:54.299 --> 08:56.371
the standards
of quality and refinement

08:56.373 --> 08:57.906
found in the best establishments

08:57.908 --> 08:59.942
on the East Coast.

08:59.944 --> 09:01.593
Now, I have written a memo

09:01.595 --> 09:04.473
to remind you of how Mr. Quebert
should be treated.

09:04.475 --> 09:05.664
Read it,

09:05.666 --> 09:07.238
reread it,

09:07.240 --> 09:08.505
and learn it by heart.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.922
"Do not disturb Mr. Quebert

09:11.924 --> 09:14.534
because he needs calm and...

09:14.536 --> 09:16.838
concentration.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.065
His previous visits to Clark's

09:19.067 --> 09:22.290
indicate that he always orders
black coffee.

09:22.292 --> 09:24.402
Serve him coffee
when he arrives,

09:24.404 --> 09:26.437
and nothing else..."

09:26.439 --> 09:30.201
Do not bother Mr. Quebert
by suggesting he order food.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.698
However,

09:31.700 --> 09:33.965
serve him
all the condiments we have,

09:33.967 --> 09:35.884
so should he be
inclined to order,

09:35.886 --> 09:38.457
he won't have to
ask for them.

09:38.459 --> 09:41.106
You see, famous writers
should not have to ask

09:41.108 --> 09:42.604
for what they want.

09:42.606 --> 09:46.252
Their minds must be free
to create.

09:46.254 --> 09:47.673
"It is possible

09:47.675 --> 09:50.669
that what he's writing
will become a masterpiece,

09:50.671 --> 09:53.318
and Clark's will be known
all over the country!"

09:53.320 --> 09:55.123
Is this one of
the best restaurants?

09:55.125 --> 09:55.929
Yes, Mrs. Quinn.

09:55.931 --> 09:56.850
Yes, Mom.

09:56.852 --> 09:58.770
And don't call me "Mom," okay?

09:58.772 --> 10:00.153
It's not
a country inn.

10:00.155 --> 10:01.382
Good.

10:01.384 --> 10:03.186
Now, I want to see you all
acting servile.

10:03.188 --> 10:05.298
And smile.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.526
Ah. Beautiful.

10:07.528 --> 10:08.908
Let's do a trial run.

10:08.910 --> 10:12.287
I will play
the esteemed Mr. Quebert.

10:12.289 --> 10:14.209
Come on!

10:16.667 --> 10:19.084
<i>In Sommerdale,
I was some sort of celebrity.</i>

10:19.086 --> 10:22.847
<i>In New York, I was just
a high school teacher</i>

10:22.849 --> 10:25.766
<i>who wrote a good first book
in his spare time,</i>

10:25.768 --> 10:27.839
<i>but people in town
assumed I was successful</i>

10:27.841 --> 10:31.257
<i>because of the way I acted
and where I lived.</i>

10:31.259 --> 10:32.985
Hey!

10:32.987 --> 10:34.905
<i>Not everyone
was fooled, though...</i>

10:34.907 --> 10:36.632
Hey, Ernie!

10:36.634 --> 10:38.016
What do you do
in New York, actually?

10:38.018 --> 10:39.858
For a living, I mean?

10:39.860 --> 10:41.780
Well, I'm a writer.

10:43.278 --> 10:45.273
Uh...

10:45.275 --> 10:48.767
Well, don't take this
the wrong way, Harry,

10:48.769 --> 10:50.764
but, uh, I contacted
the publisher,

10:50.766 --> 10:53.529
the one
who put out your book.

10:53.531 --> 10:55.756
The one you gave me,
"The Mirror of Life."

10:55.758 --> 10:59.827
I-I wanted to order
extra copies for the library.

10:59.829 --> 11:02.860
I hadn't heard of this
publisher before, but...

11:02.862 --> 11:05.663
then I discovered
that it was actually a...

11:05.665 --> 11:07.276
a print shop in Brooklyn.

11:07.278 --> 11:11.118
You paid a print shop
to publish your book.

11:18.722 --> 11:21.868
Now you know the truth.

11:21.870 --> 11:24.902
I'm a... complete impostor.

11:24.904 --> 11:28.089
No, not complete.

11:28.091 --> 11:29.702
I...

11:29.704 --> 11:31.624
I really liked the book.

11:32.007 --> 11:35.999
That's why I wanted
to order extra copies.

11:36.001 --> 11:39.301
And, uh...
anyway, who knows?

11:39.303 --> 11:40.876
Maybe the book
you're writing now

11:40.878 --> 11:42.988
will be a masterpiece.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.063
What if
I don't write it?

11:44.065 --> 11:46.060
Aw, you will.
I know you will.

11:46.062 --> 11:47.135
And don't worry, I, uh,

11:47.137 --> 11:49.288
I won't tell a soul
about my discovery.

11:52.322 --> 11:54.242
On one condition.

11:55.547 --> 11:58.117
Uh... I want, uh...

11:58.119 --> 12:03.033
you to, uh, put my name
on the last page of your book,

12:03.035 --> 12:05.145
as a "thank you,"
y-you know how writers do?

12:05.147 --> 12:06.719
Mm-hm.

12:06.721 --> 12:09.062
And, uh...

12:09.064 --> 12:11.481
I want to be
the first one mentioned,

12:11.483 --> 12:13.248
in big letters.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.782
I think it would make
my wife proud

12:15.784 --> 12:17.932
to see that I contributed
to the success

12:17.934 --> 12:19.892
of a literary masterpiece.

12:22.581 --> 12:23.999
Okay.

12:24.001 --> 12:25.381
You have yourself a deal.

12:26.843 --> 12:29.913
<i>I wanted to tell Nola
the whole truth,</i>

12:29.915 --> 12:32.104
<i>but vanity
got the better of me.</i>

12:35.061 --> 12:37.478
Then, when "The Origin of Evil"
was published,

12:37.480 --> 12:40.857
I'd go all over
the world, you know?

12:40.859 --> 12:43.775
I'd always look for her,

12:43.777 --> 12:46.350
hoping she'd be
somewhere in the crowd.

12:48.654 --> 12:51.493
I still...

12:51.495 --> 12:52.645
hoped,

12:52.647 --> 12:55.602
up until the day they...

12:55.604 --> 12:59.020
they discovered her body
in the yard.

12:59.022 --> 13:01.861
In the yard...

13:01.863 --> 13:03.244
Do you know anyone

13:03.246 --> 13:04.972
who would have
any reason

13:04.974 --> 13:06.894
to hurt her?

13:16.789 --> 13:19.938
Hands up, hands up, come on.

13:24.277 --> 13:26.235
That's good.

13:28.386 --> 13:29.497
Oh, buddy!
Buddy!

13:30.574 --> 13:31.647
Your footwork's getting
way better, bud.

13:31.649 --> 13:33.030
Way better, okay?

13:33.032 --> 13:34.950
You just gotta work on
your defense now, all right?

13:34.952 --> 13:36.218
Keep the, uh, keep the paws up.
Keep 'em up...

13:36.220 --> 13:37.792
Oh, you're bleeding.
That's a bleeder.

13:37.794 --> 13:38.713
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:38.715 --> 13:40.134
Okay, just, uh,
keep your head back.

13:40.136 --> 13:42.207
Just gotta
pinch it, okay?

13:42.209 --> 13:43.552
You got it, buddy.
You're good.

13:43.554 --> 13:45.318
You're good, big dog.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.123
Thanks, buddy.
Pinch it!

13:47.125 --> 13:48.620
You wanna
pinch it, okay?

13:48.622 --> 13:50.542
And watch the door.

13:51.234 --> 13:53.154
He's good, he's learning.

13:55.611 --> 13:56.684
Mind if I work in?

13:56.686 --> 13:57.491
No, go for it.

13:57.493 --> 13:59.413
Thanks, bud.

14:02.907 --> 14:04.827
Goldman, you, uh...

14:05.288 --> 14:06.784
you teaching boxing now, huh?

14:06.786 --> 14:07.782
Professor Quebert!

14:07.784 --> 14:08.857
I didn't know you
were into boxing.

14:08.859 --> 14:09.702
Well, a little bit,
you know.

14:09.704 --> 14:10.547
Yeah.

14:10.549 --> 14:11.468
Gotta stay in shape.

14:11.470 --> 14:12.658
Right.
You know, Hemingway boxed.

14:12.660 --> 14:14.502
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

14:14.504 --> 14:15.615
You wanna... you wanna
go a couple rounds?

14:15.617 --> 14:16.806
Uh, yeah.

14:16.808 --> 14:17.689
Just a little bit,
just to get some cardio.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.611
Yeah, yeah,
sure, why not?

14:21.493 --> 14:22.489
Here, after you.

14:22.491 --> 14:25.715
Ah, thank you,
Professor.

14:25.717 --> 14:27.789
Okay, a couple rounds,

14:27.791 --> 14:28.902
maybe three rounds?

14:28.904 --> 14:30.054
This is a little bit weird.

14:30.056 --> 14:31.052
I've never... I've never
hit a teacher before.

14:31.054 --> 14:32.128
I mean, I've wanted to...

14:32.130 --> 14:33.126
Come on, now's
your opportunity, come on.

14:33.128 --> 14:33.933
I've wanted to,
but...

14:33.935 --> 14:35.046
Yeah...

14:35.048 --> 14:36.968
Come on.

14:37.429 --> 14:38.540
This is fun.
I forgot how much fun this is.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.462
All right.

14:42.574 --> 14:43.763
Whoa!

14:44.878 --> 14:45.683
That's good.

14:45.685 --> 14:46.451
You okay?

14:46.453 --> 14:47.450
Yeah?

14:47.452 --> 14:49.523
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gimme a sec.

14:49.525 --> 14:50.291
You all right?

14:50.293 --> 14:52.213
Yeah.

14:54.824 --> 14:56.089
Wanna get dinner?

14:56.091 --> 14:58.012
We'll go get something to eat.

15:00.239 --> 15:04.537
My friend here would like
two New York strip steaks,

15:04.539 --> 15:07.071
one well done, one raw,

15:07.073 --> 15:09.530
and make that one to go.

15:09.532 --> 15:10.988
Oh, Reinhartz,

15:10.990 --> 15:12.447
when you get
a chance?

15:12.449 --> 15:15.712
Dominic Reinhartz?

15:15.714 --> 15:17.554
I remember
your short story.

15:17.556 --> 15:18.630
I was impressed.

15:18.632 --> 15:21.203
You have a real
original voice.

15:21.205 --> 15:23.775
Come by my office
tomorrow around 4:00,

15:23.777 --> 15:25.197
let's discuss it.

15:25.199 --> 15:27.194
Yes, of course.

15:27.196 --> 15:28.537
Thank you, Professor.

15:28.539 --> 15:30.111
My pleasure.

15:30.113 --> 15:30.956
Bourbon and soda for you,
right, Goldman?

15:30.958 --> 15:33.298
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.605
I, uh...

15:34.607 --> 15:36.025
I thought we were here

15:36.027 --> 15:37.792
to talk about
the story that I wrote.

15:37.794 --> 15:39.711
Oh, you have talent, Goldman.

15:39.713 --> 15:41.670
It's... it's clear
you have a gift.

15:41.672 --> 15:42.822
It is such a relief

15:42.824 --> 15:45.011
to hear you say that,
Professor. Thank you.

15:45.013 --> 15:46.547
But your story
was a piece of shit.

15:46.549 --> 15:49.197
Sloppy, superficial,

15:49.199 --> 15:51.539
the work of
a pretentious blowhard

15:51.541 --> 15:55.110
in love with the sound
of his own juvenile voice.

15:55.112 --> 15:57.032
Cheers.

15:57.570 --> 15:58.643
Um...

15:58.645 --> 16:00.064
Do you know why
the college magazine

16:00.066 --> 16:01.407
ran your stories in the back?

16:01.409 --> 16:03.097
No?

16:03.099 --> 16:05.631
Because that's
where they belong.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.245
And Reinhartz's were up front

16:07.247 --> 16:09.203
because that's where
they deserved to be.

16:09.205 --> 16:10.585
So you should have
used that

16:10.587 --> 16:12.198
as motivation
to work harder,

16:12.200 --> 16:13.389
but it was
much easier for you

16:13.391 --> 16:16.268
to do your little blowjob play,

16:16.270 --> 16:17.996
which had more to do
with your marketing skills

16:17.998 --> 16:20.338
than the quality
of your work.

16:20.340 --> 16:21.529
But that's been
your modus operandi

16:21.531 --> 16:23.526
your entire life, hasn't it?
Excuse me,

16:23.528 --> 16:24.985
all due respect, Professor,
but you don't know me.

16:24.987 --> 16:26.176
Oh, really?

16:26.178 --> 16:28.326
"Marcus the Magnificent."

16:28.328 --> 16:29.670
The boy, the genius,

16:29.672 --> 16:30.783
the legend.

16:30.785 --> 16:31.782
That's their name, okay?
Not mine.

16:31.784 --> 16:33.203
I'm willing to bet

16:33.205 --> 16:34.700
the only reason you came
to Burrows in the first place,

16:34.702 --> 16:36.236
and not one of those
Ivy League schools,

16:36.238 --> 16:38.003
is because you didn't
have the balls

16:38.005 --> 16:40.308
to measure yourself
against real competition.

16:41.998 --> 16:43.686
You're a phony.

16:43.688 --> 16:46.146
A fake.

16:48.027 --> 16:50.022
Thank you for your time,
Professor,

16:50.024 --> 16:51.944
and your, uh,
constructive criticism.

16:52.558 --> 16:54.478
Mm-hm.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.432
Here you go.

17:01.851 --> 17:03.423
What is this?

17:03.425 --> 17:04.191
Gold Boxing Gym?

17:04.193 --> 17:05.267
Mm-hm.

17:05.269 --> 17:06.955
It's real fighting
every Thursday night.

17:06.958 --> 17:08.492
It's open to the public.

17:08.493 --> 17:09.913
If you want
to become a writer,

17:09.915 --> 17:11.027
you gotta get knocked
on your ass

17:11.029 --> 17:12.256
a couple times

17:12.258 --> 17:13.215
and see
if you have the courage

17:13.218 --> 17:14.444
to stand back up.

17:14.445 --> 17:16.366
Thank you very much
for the beer.

17:19.554 --> 17:22.432
Let's go, come on!

17:44.014 --> 17:45.971
Come on, get up!
Get up, come on!

17:53.614 --> 17:54.725
<i>The first thing</i>

17:54.727 --> 17:56.147
<i>a writer has to learn</i>

17:56.149 --> 17:57.874
<i>is to fall.</i>

17:57.876 --> 18:00.219
<i>The second
is how to get back up.</i>

18:01.870 --> 18:03.213
<i>Congratulations.</i>

18:03.215 --> 18:05.134
<i>You pass.</i>

18:22.107 --> 18:23.411
<i>Harry,</i>

18:23.413 --> 18:24.409
<i>if I'm going
to help you clear your name,</i>

18:24.411 --> 18:27.405
<i>you have to trust me.</i>

18:27.407 --> 18:29.785
<i>Now,
your relationship with Nola...</i>

18:29.787 --> 18:30.822
<i>I've told you, Marcus.</i>

18:30.824 --> 18:33.126
<i>It isn't what you think.</i>

18:33.128 --> 18:34.854
<i>Nothing happened.</i>

18:34.856 --> 18:36.543
<i>I did love her,</i>

18:36.545 --> 18:38.963
<i>but I would never
do anything to hurt her.</i>

18:38.965 --> 18:41.958
<i>I can't make anyone believe me,
but it is the truth.</i>

18:41.960 --> 18:44.185
<i>Harry,
who do you trust</i>

18:44.187 --> 18:47.296
<i>that might be able to help us?</i>

18:47.298 --> 18:49.868
<i>Start with
Ernie Pinkas, the librarian.</i>

18:49.870 --> 18:50.867
<i>But Marcus, be careful.</i>

18:50.869 --> 18:52.403
<i>It's a small town.</i>

18:52.405 --> 18:54.363
<i>Everyone is going to know
you're looking into this.</i>

18:59.893 --> 19:01.427
I gotta close up,

19:01.429 --> 19:02.348
but I found some more

19:02.350 --> 19:03.730
that might
be worth checking

19:03.732 --> 19:05.652
before you go.

19:08.494 --> 19:09.529
Thanks.

19:09.531 --> 19:11.488
Uh...

19:11.490 --> 19:12.985
Okay, according to
police reports,

19:12.987 --> 19:14.752
screaming could be heard

19:14.754 --> 19:15.750
coming from
the Kellergan house

19:15.752 --> 19:17.672
the day
the girl disappeared.

19:18.594 --> 19:21.011
However, uh, testimony
from neighbors suggests

19:21.013 --> 19:22.585
that the noise
was actually music

19:22.587 --> 19:24.390
being played at high volume
by her father,

19:24.392 --> 19:26.348
as was his habit.

19:26.350 --> 19:28.038
He still does it.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.457
The Reverend always
cranks up the volume

19:30.459 --> 19:31.916
to drown out the sound

19:31.918 --> 19:33.798
of his working
in the garage.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.985
Maintains that good music
is always preferable

19:36.987 --> 19:39.788
to the sound
of his hammering,

19:39.790 --> 19:41.632
even if it is too loud.

19:41.634 --> 19:42.592
Right.

19:42.594 --> 19:44.204
Reverend David Kellergan
confirmed

19:44.206 --> 19:45.203
that he was home at the time,

19:45.205 --> 19:46.931
working on his motorcycle,

19:46.933 --> 19:49.503
and didn't notice anything amiss
until later that evening

19:49.505 --> 19:51.730
when he went into
his daughter's bedroom

19:51.732 --> 19:53.612
and found her gone.

19:53.614 --> 19:55.225
Even if
she'd called out for help,

19:55.227 --> 19:56.454
he wouldn't have heard her.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.489
The music was too loud.

19:58.491 --> 20:00.834
He's, uh, always blamed
himself for that.

20:02.984 --> 20:03.865
Ready?

20:03.867 --> 20:05.209
Mm-hm.

20:05.211 --> 20:07.859
You should probably talk
to Mrs. Quinn, too.

20:07.861 --> 20:08.973
Mrs. Quinn?

20:08.975 --> 20:11.046
Yeah, Jenny's mother.

20:11.048 --> 20:13.503
The former owner of Clark's?

20:13.505 --> 20:15.922
<i>Just yesterday,
she was ranting and raving...</i>

20:15.924 --> 20:17.804
I knew Harry Quebert
was obsessed

20:17.806 --> 20:19.379
with that poor girl,

20:19.381 --> 20:23.871
and I had proof,
irrefutable proof,

20:23.873 --> 20:24.793
but someone...

20:24.795 --> 20:27.635
someone stole it.

20:27.637 --> 20:30.284
<i>What kind of proof?</i>
No idea.

20:30.286 --> 20:35.391
But she is given to, uh,
inflating the truth.

20:35.393 --> 20:37.503
Have you heard from Harry?

20:37.505 --> 20:40.076
Yeah, I'm going to see him
again tomorrow, actually.

20:40.078 --> 20:41.727
Say hello to him
for me, will you?

20:41.729 --> 20:43.417
Yeah, will do.

20:43.419 --> 20:45.990
You know, I-I used to work
at a textile factory

20:45.992 --> 20:46.911
in Augusta.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.140
Uh-huh.

20:48.142 --> 20:51.289
I never went to college,
but I always loved to read.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.669
Harry let me take
literature classes at Burrows

20:53.671 --> 20:54.668
for free.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.821
Oh, right on.

20:55.823 --> 20:56.588
Well, yeah,
you should, uh,

20:56.590 --> 20:57.817
you should go see him.

20:57.819 --> 20:59.276
He'd like that.

21:01.774 --> 21:03.809
Thanks for everything.

21:05.423 --> 21:07.648
She was 15 years old,
Marcus.

21:07.650 --> 21:09.260
Just a kid.

21:09.262 --> 21:10.605
He didn't kill her, Ernie.

21:10.607 --> 21:12.947
Even so,

21:12.949 --> 21:14.444
the stuff he wrote
in that book...

21:14.446 --> 21:16.671
It was
a work of art.

21:16.673 --> 21:17.824
You know, that book
is a masterpiece.

21:17.826 --> 21:19.705
Maybe.

21:19.707 --> 21:22.086
Or maybe it was
the devil's work.

21:22.088 --> 21:25.889
Either way,
it's no longer in this library.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.378
<i>Guess who just saved your ass?</i>

21:55.380 --> 21:56.992
I got Barnaski to back off.

21:56.994 --> 21:58.182
He's agreed
to tear up your contract.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.795
Yeah?
In exchange for what?

21:59.797 --> 22:01.215
<i>All you have to do</i>

22:01.217 --> 22:03.404
<i>is write a book
about the Harry Quebert affair.</i>

22:03.406 --> 22:05.248
Bye, Doug.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.091
<i>No, no, Barnaski thinks
it'll be huge, okay?</i>

22:07.093 --> 22:09.472
Harry's arrest is all
anyone's talking about.

22:09.474 --> 22:11.353
<i>Yeah, I'm not going
to exploit Harry's troubles</i>

22:11.355 --> 22:12.735
<i>for my own
personal gain, okay?</i>

22:12.737 --> 22:14.156
Or yours.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.731
<i>Marcus, if you don't say yes,</i>

22:15.733 --> 22:16.921
<i>he's gonna
clean you out, okay?</i>

22:16.923 --> 22:18.265
<i>Your contract expires
in 13 days...</i>

22:18.267 --> 22:19.686
Hang on,
hang on, hang on.

22:19.688 --> 22:20.838
<i>Promise me that
you'll at least think about it.</i>

22:20.840 --> 22:22.990
Okay, wait a second,
wait a second.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.099
Yeah, I thought about it.
Bye, Doug.

22:26.101 --> 22:28.021
<i>Marcus...</i>

24:19.996 --> 24:24.718
So, this is where
they found Nola's body.

24:24.720 --> 24:29.555
Um, it's very easy access
from the house,

24:29.557 --> 24:34.970
but it's well hidden
behind these trees and bushes.

24:34.972 --> 24:36.583
It's also right
in front of the ocean,

24:36.585 --> 24:38.350
with no fence
protecting the property,

24:38.352 --> 24:39.847
so anyone could've just
come up from the beach...

24:39.849 --> 24:41.652
Oh, shit!

24:41.654 --> 24:43.187
What the hell
are you doing here?

24:43.189 --> 24:44.762
Hi, hi. I'm just, um...

24:44.764 --> 24:47.219
I'm, uh, I'm staying
in the property, okay?

24:47.221 --> 24:48.218
I'm a friend of the owner's.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.447
I'm a... I'm a writer.

24:49.449 --> 24:51.252
My name is Marcus Goldman.

24:51.254 --> 24:53.174
Well, if you're a writer,
you should be writing, right?

24:54.901 --> 24:55.936
You're a cop?

24:55.938 --> 24:57.933
Sergeant Perry Gahalowood,

24:57.935 --> 25:00.276
Maine State Police
Investigative Services Bureau.

25:00.278 --> 25:01.812
You scared
the shit out of me.

25:01.814 --> 25:02.848
This is
a crime scene, sir.

25:02.850 --> 25:04.115
You need to leave.

25:04.117 --> 25:05.267
Sorry, man, I thought
you were, like, a...

25:05.269 --> 25:06.419
like a... a criminal,

25:06.421 --> 25:07.649
a bad guy, sorry.

25:07.651 --> 25:09.876
Why, 'cause I'm black?

25:09.878 --> 25:11.296
No, because you're trespassing.

25:11.298 --> 25:13.754
Uh-huh.

25:13.756 --> 25:15.328
The, uh, Maine State Police
issue that tie?

25:16.444 --> 25:18.017
No, my daughter
gave me this tie.

25:18.019 --> 25:18.707
Hmm.

25:18.709 --> 25:20.013
You know what?
Get out of here.

25:20.015 --> 25:20.858
Off the property...

25:20.860 --> 25:21.511
No, no, no,
I'm sorry...

25:21.513 --> 25:22.970
Now.

25:22.972 --> 25:24.468
Excuse me, I'm a friend
of Mr. Quebert's,

25:24.470 --> 25:26.390
and he asked me to look after
the house for him, okay?

25:27.695 --> 25:28.845
Listen...

25:28.847 --> 25:30.612
Mr. Quebert is accused
of a double homicide,

25:30.614 --> 25:31.764
all right?

25:31.766 --> 25:33.453
His house has been searched
and sealed.

25:33.455 --> 25:35.642
You're being evicted, sir...

25:35.644 --> 25:37.293
No, excuse me, there are
no seals on the house, okay?

25:37.295 --> 25:39.060
And no seals means
access is not prohibited.

25:39.062 --> 25:40.173
I'm sorry,

25:40.175 --> 25:41.671
I have permission
from the owner to be here...

25:42.633 --> 25:43.974
and according to
Maine State statutes,

25:43.976 --> 25:45.511
you're required to give him
30 days' notice

25:45.513 --> 25:47.354
before you can evict, okay?

25:47.356 --> 25:48.583
You know,

25:48.585 --> 25:50.349
I would have never thought
some hack writer

25:50.351 --> 25:51.578
afraid to get mud
on his fancy shoes

25:51.580 --> 25:53.459
would want to
come here and squat.

25:53.461 --> 25:54.689
Uh-huh.

25:54.691 --> 25:57.069
Well, uh, maybe you should
think a little bit more,

25:57.071 --> 25:59.296
even if that is difficult
for a policeman.

25:59.298 --> 26:01.907
And, um... you know,
these are Tod's loafers.

26:01.909 --> 26:03.520
Oh, Tod's loafers?

26:03.522 --> 26:04.979
Yeah, and if you knew
how much they cost,

26:04.981 --> 26:06.209
sir,

26:06.211 --> 26:07.591
you wouldn't want
to get mud on them either.

26:07.593 --> 26:08.513
'Kay?

26:08.515 --> 26:09.434
Well, how about this,

26:09.436 --> 26:10.970
if you cross
any more police tape

26:10.972 --> 26:12.390
and infiltrate
a crime scene again,

26:12.392 --> 26:14.195
you'll be sitting
in a cell.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.309
Right.

26:15.311 --> 26:16.960
Just you and your fancy
fuckin' Tod's.

26:16.962 --> 26:17.921
Well, um, see, the
thing is, Sergeant,

26:17.923 --> 26:19.149
I'm actually, uh,

26:19.151 --> 26:20.339
conducting my own
investigation, so...

26:20.341 --> 26:21.914
Oh, your own
investigation?

26:21.916 --> 26:22.874
Well, the good citizens
of Sommerdale

26:22.876 --> 26:23.911
can sleep in peace now, huh?

26:23.913 --> 26:25.562
Now that you're on the job.

26:26.524 --> 26:27.827
Oh, and by the way,

26:27.829 --> 26:29.671
you owe me $15
for that book of yours.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.090
Holy shit,
that was terrible.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.510
Just like 300 pages of turd.

26:36.930 --> 26:38.195
Just fuck off,
Sergeant, okay?

26:38.197 --> 26:39.539
Oh, shit!

26:39.541 --> 26:40.307
Oh!

26:40.309 --> 26:41.498
Oh...

26:42.883 --> 26:44.378
Now, that's some
good investigating, man.

26:44.380 --> 26:45.607
Very thorough.

26:46.799 --> 26:49.140
Hey, let us know if we missed
anything, all right?

26:49.142 --> 26:50.675
Hey! You...

26:50.677 --> 26:51.712
Wait!

26:51.714 --> 26:53.634
Excuse... Sergeant!

26:54.978 --> 26:56.013
Wait! Hey!

26:56.015 --> 26:57.357
Just because he wrote
a book about Nola,

26:57.359 --> 26:59.815
it doesn't mean
he killed her, okay?

26:59.817 --> 27:01.350
We found the girl's corpse
in his yard

27:01.352 --> 27:03.501
buried with
the manuscript of his book.

27:03.503 --> 27:05.383
Hey, add that to
the black Monte Carlo,

27:05.385 --> 27:07.495
and, uh... well,
you do the math, Inspector.

27:07.497 --> 27:08.723
Black Monte Carlo?

27:08.725 --> 27:10.413
Yeah, the one they saw
leaving the crime scene.

27:10.415 --> 27:11.603
What about it?

27:11.605 --> 27:13.564
It's the same make and model
your friend drove.

27:21.013 --> 27:24.199
Harry didn't kill
that girl, Travis, I know it.

27:24.201 --> 27:25.812
Because
he's your friend?

27:25.814 --> 27:27.079
Because there's
someone out there

27:27.081 --> 27:29.536
who doesn't want me
to figure out who did.

27:29.538 --> 27:31.456
I, um...

27:31.458 --> 27:33.685
I found that
in Harry's front door.

27:36.911 --> 27:39.136
This is serious, Marcus.

27:39.138 --> 27:42.595
You should've handed this
over to Gahalowood.

27:44.207 --> 27:46.778
Okay, I'm gonna register
a complaint

27:46.780 --> 27:49.082
in order to open a file,

27:49.084 --> 27:52.922
but I want you to call me
if you see anything suspicious.

27:52.924 --> 27:55.111
It doesn't matter
how small or trivial.

27:55.113 --> 27:57.801
Okay, I will. Thanks.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.676
Okay, uh, thank you.

28:06.978 --> 28:08.512
Listen, I know
you're busy,

28:08.514 --> 28:10.279
but... do you think

28:10.281 --> 28:12.201
you could show me
the crime scene?

28:12.623 --> 28:14.618
Look, if you want,

28:14.620 --> 28:16.615
I can take you to the spot
where it happened, yeah,

28:16.617 --> 28:17.575
just to see.

28:17.577 --> 28:18.765
Yeah.

28:18.767 --> 28:21.300
Yeah, I'd like that.

28:24.104 --> 28:25.716
<i>Not only did Travis agree</i>

28:25.718 --> 28:27.751
<i>to take me to the crime scene,</i>

28:27.753 --> 28:31.053
<i>he took me back 33 years,</i>

28:31.055 --> 28:34.817
<i>to when he was just
a young cop in Sommerdale.</i>

28:34.819 --> 28:37.082
<i>A few miles past Goose Cove,</i>

28:37.084 --> 28:38.771
<i>we arrived at Deborah Cooper's,</i>

28:38.773 --> 28:40.922
<i>at the edge
of Side Creek Forest,</i>

28:40.924 --> 28:43.458
<i>the spot Nola was last seen.</i>

28:53.480 --> 28:56.130
Hasn't changed
all that much.

28:57.090 --> 28:58.355
When I got here,

28:58.357 --> 29:00.045
Deborah Cooper was standing
in front of that door.

29:00.047 --> 29:01.082
Hmm.

29:01.084 --> 29:02.272
I told her to calm down,

29:02.274 --> 29:04.195
go back inside, not to worry.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.994
Who lives here now?

29:07.996 --> 29:10.182
A couple from Boston,
they come for the summer.

29:10.184 --> 29:10.989
Follow you
through here?

29:10.991 --> 29:12.679
Yeah, yeah,
back through here.

29:12.681 --> 29:13.869
It was, uh, it was getting dark

29:13.871 --> 29:17.095
by the time Chief Pratt
and I got here.

29:17.097 --> 29:18.554
And whatever happened
to Chief Pratt?

29:18.556 --> 29:19.783
Oh, he retired.

29:19.785 --> 29:21.472
He still lives
in Sommerdale,

29:21.474 --> 29:23.394
up on Mountain Drive,
you know.

29:27.235 --> 29:28.730
It was here.

29:28.732 --> 29:32.070
<i>I was only a year
into the job back then.</i>

29:32.072 --> 29:35.334
<i>It was along the path
that led to the beach.</i>

29:35.336 --> 29:38.753
<i>This is where we found the...
the blood and hair</i>

29:38.755 --> 29:41.210
<i>and pieces of fabric
from what she was wearing...</i>

29:41.212 --> 29:42.861
and we figured

29:42.863 --> 29:45.395
that Nola must have escaped
her attacker,

29:45.397 --> 29:47.239
and ran back
to Mrs. Cooper's house

29:47.241 --> 29:49.161
for help.

29:51.887 --> 29:54.345
But it was too late.

29:55.919 --> 30:00.488
Deborah Cooper was shot
and killed right here.

30:04.405 --> 30:05.402
Then,

30:05.404 --> 30:08.284
he dragged Nola to his car...

30:09.589 --> 30:11.047
and that's where

30:11.049 --> 30:13.696
the trail of blood
stopped.

30:13.698 --> 30:15.117
And the car?

30:15.119 --> 30:16.154
Well, there was
a chase.

30:18.690 --> 30:21.491
<i>We set up roadblocks
all over the area, but...</i>

30:23.375 --> 30:24.909
<i>...he lost us.</i>

30:24.911 --> 30:26.560
He must've known
the back roads,

30:26.562 --> 30:28.980
been familiar
with the area.

30:28.982 --> 30:31.169
Not a day goes by
without me thinking

30:31.171 --> 30:32.819
how things
might have been different

30:32.821 --> 30:36.429
if we'd just caught
that goddamn Monte Carlo.

30:36.431 --> 30:38.925
Maybe we could've
saved the girl.

30:38.927 --> 30:41.882
You're convinced it was Harry
who was driving that car?

30:41.884 --> 30:44.647
Well, yeah, now.

30:44.649 --> 30:47.373
Back then, his alibi
checked out, but...

30:47.375 --> 30:48.871
given recent events,

30:48.873 --> 30:50.792
I don't see who else
it could've been.

30:51.945 --> 30:54.362
Sorry, Marcus.

30:54.364 --> 30:56.284
Yeah.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.776
Chief Pratt
will be right out.

30:59.778 --> 31:01.005
You're in for a treat.

31:01.007 --> 31:02.887
This is my grandmother's recipe.

31:02.889 --> 31:05.498
The secret's the maple syrup.

31:07.036 --> 31:10.721
Oh, go easy
on that stuff.

31:10.723 --> 31:12.180
That's what gave me diabetes.

31:12.182 --> 31:14.102
Huh?

31:15.791 --> 31:17.479
Now...

31:17.481 --> 31:20.474
what can I do for you,
Mr. Goldman?

31:20.476 --> 31:22.201
He's that nice
young man

31:22.203 --> 31:24.736
that wrote that
naughty bestseller,

31:24.738 --> 31:26.042
Harry Quebert's protégé.

31:26.044 --> 31:26.925
Oh...

31:26.927 --> 31:28.230
You're awfully young

31:28.232 --> 31:29.920
to know so much
about the female anatomy.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.571
Oh, thank you, um...

31:31.573 --> 31:32.608
Pot your flowers.

31:32.610 --> 31:34.530
Maggie, pot.

31:35.759 --> 31:36.948
I was, um...

31:36.950 --> 31:38.829
I was wondering,

31:38.831 --> 31:40.787
did you have any other
reason at the time

31:40.789 --> 31:42.362
for suspecting Harry,

31:42.364 --> 31:44.284
other than his owning
a black Monte Carlo?

31:45.359 --> 31:47.661
Not enough to arrest him...

31:47.663 --> 31:50.080
<i>But the day after
Nola disappeared,</i>

31:50.082 --> 31:52.577
<i>when I saw him
at the roadblock,</i>

31:52.579 --> 31:54.498
<i>he was acting awfully strange.</i>

31:58.223 --> 31:59.143
Good morning, Chief.

31:59.145 --> 32:00.410
Hey, Harry.

32:00.412 --> 32:02.061
I just heard the news
on the radio.

32:02.063 --> 32:03.405
What's going on?

32:03.407 --> 32:05.249
Ah, we don't know
anything yet.

32:05.251 --> 32:06.976
She was last seen
near Side Creek Lane

32:06.978 --> 32:08.243
last night.

32:08.245 --> 32:09.741
Since then,
no trace of her.

32:09.743 --> 32:10.624
I mean, we've...

32:10.626 --> 32:12.083
we've secured
the whole area.

32:12.085 --> 32:14.925
We're gonna search
the forest, but...

32:14.927 --> 32:17.882
whatever happened,
it isn't good.

32:17.884 --> 32:19.149
Yeah.

32:19.151 --> 32:20.839
Where are you
coming from, Harry?

32:20.841 --> 32:22.221
Um, Boston...

32:22.223 --> 32:23.988
uh, for my book.

32:23.990 --> 32:25.370
Boston's, uh,

32:25.372 --> 32:27.021
in the opposite
direction.

32:27.023 --> 32:28.096
Yeah, I know.

32:28.098 --> 32:30.479
I had to go to Augusta after.

32:33.397 --> 32:35.317
Mind if we take a look
in your trunk?

32:37.352 --> 32:38.695
No.

32:39.656 --> 32:41.459
Um... here,
it's, uh, this round key...

32:41.461 --> 32:43.381
I got it.

32:58.550 --> 33:00.621
All right, Harry.

33:00.623 --> 33:02.349
Hey, uh, you know,
you hear anything,

33:02.351 --> 33:04.614
you see anything,
think of anything,

33:04.616 --> 33:05.536
you let me know, okay?

33:05.538 --> 33:06.611
Yes. I will.

33:06.613 --> 33:07.878
All right. Hey, good
luck with the book.

33:07.880 --> 33:08.915
Yeah, thank you.

33:11.260 --> 33:14.522
<i>We spent months
just chasing our own tails,</i>

33:14.524 --> 33:16.979
<i>following leads
that went nowhere,</i>

33:16.981 --> 33:20.207
when the proof was right here
under our noses.

33:22.012 --> 33:24.160
What about you,
Mr. Goldman?

33:24.162 --> 33:26.157
Anything Quebert might have
said or done in the past

33:26.159 --> 33:29.346
that now seems suspect?

33:32.150 --> 33:35.757
<i>Room 8 at 8:00,
then away forever.</i>

33:35.759 --> 33:37.139
"Burn it all.

33:37.141 --> 33:40.173
I'm in danger."

33:40.175 --> 33:42.477
Uh, no.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.975
No, nothing comes to mind.

33:54.345 --> 33:55.380
You sure you wanna
stay here?

33:55.382 --> 33:58.797
Uh, no.
No, actually...

33:58.799 --> 34:00.487
this might sound
a little strange,

34:00.489 --> 34:03.021
but I'd like to know
if someone slept here in room 8

34:03.023 --> 34:05.709
on August 30th, 1975?

34:05.711 --> 34:07.015
Let me guess,

34:07.017 --> 34:08.820
your mom had an affair
around the time you were born,

34:08.822 --> 34:10.393
and you wanna know
who your real dad is?

34:10.396 --> 34:11.775
Uh, no.

34:11.777 --> 34:14.272
No, I was unmistakably planned.

34:14.274 --> 34:15.309
I'm just checking out a story.

34:15.311 --> 34:16.730
Oh, sorry, man.

34:16.732 --> 34:18.420
We can only
go back two years.

34:18.422 --> 34:21.069
Theoretically, of course.

34:21.071 --> 34:22.452
I couldn't reveal
that type of information

34:22.454 --> 34:23.449
without a warrant,

34:23.452 --> 34:25.371
or, uh...

34:26.408 --> 34:27.828
Gotcha.

34:27.830 --> 34:29.750
Thanks anyway.

34:42.460 --> 34:44.340
Hey, man,
why do you call this place

34:44.342 --> 34:45.875
the "By the Sea" motel?

34:45.877 --> 34:47.719
I mean, there isn't even a view.

34:47.721 --> 34:49.907
No, but the path
through the forest

34:49.909 --> 34:51.830
goes to the beach.

35:15.173 --> 35:16.285
Roy, can I call you back?

35:16.287 --> 35:17.705
I'm right in the middle
of something.

35:17.707 --> 35:19.280
<i>Well, drop
whatever it is you're doing</i>

35:19.282 --> 35:20.892
<i>and gather ye rosebuds,</i>

35:20.894 --> 35:22.736
<i>which I am flinging
at your feet.</i>

35:22.738 --> 35:23.964
<i>Look, talk quick, Roy, okay?</i>

35:23.966 --> 35:25.078
<i>You're draining my battery.</i>

35:25.080 --> 35:26.384
All right,
all right, listen.

35:26.386 --> 35:28.918
We're gonna put
your book out in the fall.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.224
That means you have
one and a half months

35:30.226 --> 35:31.145
to finish it.

35:31.147 --> 35:32.489
I'm sorry, a month and a half?

35:32.491 --> 35:34.640
That's... that's...
that's insane, Roy.

35:34.642 --> 35:36.368
It took me... it took me years
to write my first book.

35:36.370 --> 35:37.289
I don't...

35:37.291 --> 35:39.018
I don't even know
what I'd write.

35:39.020 --> 35:40.553
<i>Well, which is why</i>

35:40.555 --> 35:41.782
I have gone to the trouble

35:41.784 --> 35:44.931
of supplying you with five
adorable ghostwriters

35:44.933 --> 35:46.966
who I'm sure are going
to capture your voice

35:46.968 --> 35:47.849
beautifully.

35:47.851 --> 35:49.693
Hey, no, Roy.

35:49.695 --> 35:51.690
<i>Marcus, come on.</i>

35:51.692 --> 35:54.070
<i>We're trying to write
a bestseller, right? Okay?</i>

35:54.072 --> 35:56.720
<i>All I need is some facts
and some suspense,</i>

35:56.722 --> 35:57.987
<i>and some titillating details</i>

35:57.989 --> 35:59.523
<i>about the old man
and the little girl.</i>

35:59.525 --> 36:00.598
Look, hey,

36:00.600 --> 36:02.557
<i>it wasn't like that, okay?</i>

36:02.559 --> 36:05.552
None of that... none of that
means shit to me, okay?

36:05.554 --> 36:07.472
This is what I told your agent.

36:07.474 --> 36:08.931
You do this for me, right,

36:08.933 --> 36:10.352
I will rip up your old contract.

36:10.354 --> 36:12.464
I will give you
an advance of $1,000,000.

36:12.466 --> 36:14.153
<i>It's not gonna happen, Roy.</i>

36:14.155 --> 36:16.073
Okay? No.
No ghostwriters.

36:16.075 --> 36:18.570
No sleaze. No sex.

36:18.572 --> 36:19.607
Hi.

36:19.609 --> 36:22.064
No made-up scenes
about sleaze and sex.

36:22.066 --> 36:23.523
No book, okay?

36:23.525 --> 36:25.175
In that case,
the old contract stands,

36:25.177 --> 36:27.902
and I expect a manuscript
from you in 11 days.

37:15.557 --> 37:17.437
Oh, my God...

37:18.706 --> 37:19.894
When they called me,

37:19.896 --> 37:21.276
they said, "Perry,
you better come downstairs,

37:21.278 --> 37:22.275
there's a guy here

37:22.277 --> 37:23.196
who's been waiting for you
for an hour."

37:23.198 --> 37:24.080
Yeah...

37:24.082 --> 37:25.347
So I interrupt
my meal,

37:25.349 --> 37:27.574
rush down here to see
what the damn emergency is,

37:27.576 --> 37:29.034
and who do I find?

37:29.036 --> 37:30.723
Sherlock... Shithead.

37:30.725 --> 37:32.451
Whoa, whoa, okay, okay,
look, you know what,

37:32.453 --> 37:33.603
I think maybe that we, uh,

37:33.605 --> 37:35.677
we got off on the wrong foot,
but, uh...

37:35.679 --> 37:38.250
Your face on the back cover
of that damn book of yours

37:38.252 --> 37:40.208
has been smiling out
from my wife's nightstand

37:40.210 --> 37:41.322
for weeks.

37:41.324 --> 37:42.934
You've slept with us,
had dinner with us,

37:42.936 --> 37:44.278
been on vacation with us.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.160
You have fucking ruined my life.

37:46.162 --> 37:47.120
Well, frankly,
Sergeant,

37:47.122 --> 37:48.080
I'm shocked you
actually found a woman

37:48.082 --> 37:49.462
willing to spend
her life with you,

37:49.464 --> 37:50.652
so congrat...

37:50.654 --> 37:52.574
Asshole...

37:55.762 --> 37:57.682
I didn't say
you could come in.

37:59.333 --> 38:00.675
What in God's name
do you want?

38:00.677 --> 38:01.942
Information,
Sergeant.

38:01.944 --> 38:03.248
I have a pathological need
to know everything.

38:03.250 --> 38:04.246
I inherited it from my mother...

38:04.248 --> 38:05.782
Don't touch that.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.161
I wanna know if Nola Kellergan
was abducted and killed

38:09.163 --> 38:10.428
at the same time.

38:10.430 --> 38:11.773
Yes.

38:11.775 --> 38:13.002
The bone scan confirmed it.

38:13.004 --> 38:14.307
What about the autopsy?

38:14.309 --> 38:15.882
Can you give me
any more details?

38:15.884 --> 38:17.494
You want details?

38:17.496 --> 38:18.493
Here's what I can tell you.

38:18.495 --> 38:20.451
Her skull was smashed.

38:20.453 --> 38:21.910
Crushed.

38:21.912 --> 38:23.408
Flattened.

38:23.410 --> 38:24.829
I mean, feel free to pick
the appropriate term.

38:24.831 --> 38:25.712
With what?

38:25.714 --> 38:27.056
Inconclusive.

38:27.058 --> 38:28.978
By a man or a woman?

38:29.784 --> 38:31.395
Deborah Cooper
identified the suspect

38:31.397 --> 38:32.586
as being a man.

38:32.588 --> 38:35.773
This conversation
is now officially over.

38:35.775 --> 38:37.616
Goodbye, writer.

38:37.618 --> 38:38.960
Sergeant?

38:38.962 --> 38:41.343
This case, does it, uh,
does it mean anything to you?

38:43.647 --> 38:45.603
You know...

38:45.605 --> 38:47.562
I've seen a lot
of crazy shit as a cop.

38:47.564 --> 38:49.443
People up in this
corner of the country

38:49.445 --> 38:50.480
do a lot of...

38:50.482 --> 38:52.554
disgusting stuff

38:52.556 --> 38:55.088
with wood chippers, and axes,

38:55.090 --> 38:57.046
and snow blowers.

38:57.048 --> 38:58.582
Stuff I couldn't even...

38:58.584 --> 39:01.654
make up.

39:01.656 --> 39:03.843
But I have two daughters,

39:03.845 --> 39:05.763
and I can't imagine
going through

39:05.765 --> 39:07.685
what Mr. Kellergan
has gone through.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.126
Yes?

39:43.128 --> 39:45.047
My... my name
is Marcus Goldman.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.389
I'm a writer.

39:47.391 --> 39:49.194
Yes?

39:49.196 --> 39:51.116
I was wondering
if you had a few minutes?

40:09.509 --> 40:12.886
Okay, Mr. Goldman...

40:12.888 --> 40:15.075
what brings you here?

40:15.077 --> 40:16.111
A book?

40:16.113 --> 40:17.801
I'm not entirely sure, Reverend.

40:17.803 --> 40:19.837
Uh...

40:19.839 --> 40:21.987
uh, would you be
opposed to the idea

40:21.989 --> 40:23.909
of a book about your daughter?

40:26.751 --> 40:28.863
Mmm...

40:30.207 --> 40:34.927
Depends on...
what you're writing it for.

40:34.929 --> 40:36.157
If it's to help other parents

40:36.159 --> 40:39.267
avoid the same mistakes I made,

40:39.269 --> 40:41.533
I suppose it could be
some sort of...

40:41.535 --> 40:43.455
some sort of penance.

40:44.299 --> 40:45.565
You see, Mr. Goldman,

40:45.567 --> 40:47.754
I didn't watch out
for my daughter properly,

40:47.756 --> 40:49.289
and that's the...

40:58.162 --> 41:00.234
I always
held out hope...

41:00.236 --> 41:02.614
even after all this time,

41:02.616 --> 41:06.110
that... someday
she'd come home to me.

41:10.604 --> 41:12.368
I even kept her room

41:12.370 --> 41:16.632
the exact same way
as the day she went missing.

41:18.207 --> 41:20.394
Nobody comes in here anymore,

41:20.396 --> 41:22.314
just the maid
doing a little dusting

41:22.316 --> 41:24.236
every now and then.

41:42.629 --> 41:44.777
I read you were in the garage

41:44.779 --> 41:46.044
the evening she disappeared?

41:46.046 --> 41:49.961
Working on that damn Harley.

41:49.963 --> 41:52.880
I will be forever.

41:52.882 --> 41:55.493
Trying to repair
the unrepairable.

41:58.258 --> 42:01.100
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Reverend.

42:02.098 --> 42:05.475
God... gives us trials

42:05.477 --> 42:09.354
and tests our faith in Him
every single day, Mr. Goldman.

42:09.356 --> 42:10.889
Sometimes we pass 'em...

42:12.773 --> 42:15.307
Sometimes we fail.

42:18.149 --> 42:21.526
The bag
that she was buried with,

42:21.528 --> 42:22.716
is that all that was missing?

42:22.718 --> 42:23.523
No clothes,

42:23.525 --> 42:25.865
nothing else?

42:25.867 --> 42:28.707
Not even her tip money.

42:28.709 --> 42:31.395
There's still $120 here.

42:31.397 --> 42:32.777
Well, that doesn't make
much sense, does it,

42:32.779 --> 42:34.853
if she was
running away?

42:36.350 --> 42:38.270
Why would she be running away?

42:41.266 --> 42:44.374
How well did you know
Harry Quebert?

42:44.376 --> 42:46.296
Hardly at all.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.943
I met him a few times.

42:48.945 --> 42:50.019
Really?

42:50.021 --> 42:51.325
Even though you've
lived in the same town

42:51.327 --> 42:52.323
for more than
30 years,

42:52.325 --> 42:53.245
you never...?

42:53.247 --> 42:55.280
I've kept to myself,
Mr. Goldman,

42:55.282 --> 42:58.966
since my wife passed
many years ago.

42:58.968 --> 43:00.041
So you weren't aware

43:00.043 --> 43:03.614
of their
relationship at all?

43:04.767 --> 43:07.491
She was 15 years old...

43:07.493 --> 43:10.716
Mr. Goldman.

43:10.718 --> 43:13.788
There's a special place in Hell

43:13.790 --> 43:17.936
for that demon Son of Lucifer

43:17.938 --> 43:19.279
preying...

43:19.281 --> 43:22.467
on my little girl.

43:22.469 --> 43:25.001
Oh, God...

43:25.003 --> 43:26.153
Get out!

43:26.155 --> 43:27.037
Please,
just go now.

43:27.039 --> 43:28.959
Okay.

44:04.441 --> 44:06.360
What the fuck?

44:08.357 --> 44:09.891
Hey! Hey!

44:09.893 --> 44:10.775
Wait!

44:10.777 --> 44:13.692
Hey! Hey!
