WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:03.795
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.878 --> 00:07.924
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:08.007 --> 00:12.095
- MELANIE, EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.763
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.765
- OH, I THINK YOU DO.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.934
YOUR HAIR LOOKS AMAZING.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.060
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST BLOW OUT?

00:19.144 --> 00:20.937
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.564
SEVEN, EIGHT DAYS?
WHO KEEPS TRACK?

00:22.647 --> 00:25.191
- WE DO, IT'S BEEN 12 DAYS.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.444
WHO IS THIS MAGICAL
HAIRDRESSER?

00:27.527 --> 00:30.280
- WE DEMAND TO KNOW
WHO'S BLOWING YOU.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.327
- I'D RATHER NOT SAY.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.620
- WHY NOT?

00:37.704 --> 00:41.332
- BECAUSE EVERY TIME I FIND A
COOL, CHARMING CLEVELAND PLACE,

00:41.416 --> 00:42.751
YOU TWO DO SOMETHING
TO RUIN IT.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.669
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:44.753 --> 00:46.671
- RAY'S DRY CLEANERS.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.673
- THEY WERE TRYING
TO DEVALUE MY BRAND.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.884
- THEY JUST WANTED TO PUT YOUR
PHOTO ON THEIR WALL.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.469
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.179
- NOT WHEN THE ONLY OTHER
HEADSHOTS ON THE WALL

00:54.262 --> 00:58.683
ARE OF THEIR UGLY
NIECE AND KLINGER.

00:58.767 --> 01:03.855
- ACTUALLY, I THINK
THEY'RE BOTH HIS NIECE.

01:03.938 --> 01:06.107
- ANYWAY, EVERY TIME
I GO IN THERE,

01:06.191 --> 01:08.067
RAY ASKS WHY YOU DON'T
COME AROUND ANYMORE.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.487
IT'S EMBARRASSING.
- WHO IS RAY?

01:10.570 --> 01:14.532
- THE MAN WHO OWNS
"RAY'S" DRY CLEANERS.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.785
THE PLACE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.203
- OH, COME ON, MELANIE.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.121
THAT'S JUST VICTORIA
BEING VICTORIA.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.998
WE ALL KNOW SHE CAN BE A CAT
AMONG PIGEONS.

01:22.081 --> 01:24.834
- ENGLISH, PLEASE.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.377
- THAT IS ENGLISH.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.962
ORIGINAL ENGLISH
BEFORE YOU PEOPLE

01:28.046 --> 01:30.048
BASTARDIZED IT
WITH YOUR...

01:30.131 --> 01:35.220
[American accent]
HAMBURGERS...AND ELEVATORS.

01:35.303 --> 01:39.140
THE POINT IS,
I DON'T RUIN PLACES.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.351
- YOU TOLD THE MANAGER AT
GREMORE'S THAT THEY

01:41.434 --> 01:43.686
NEEDED TO INCORPORATE
MORE VEGAN DISHES.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.981
- WELL, THEY SHOULD.
- THEY'RE A BARBECUE JOINT.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.651
- VEGANISM IS THE NEW ATKINS.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.528
I'M GIVING THEM THE TOOLS
TO BE RELEVANT.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.696
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.074
YOU TWO ARE ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN
YOUR NOSES AT CLEVELAND.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.700
- WELL, OF COURSE.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.371
LOOKING DOWN THE NOSE IS
FLATTERING TO THE NECKLINE.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.346
{\an8}- HOW GREAT IS IT THAT WE GOT
APPOINTMENTS AT THE SAME TIME?

02:18.429 --> 02:19.931
{\an8}NOW WE CAN GOSSIP
WITH EACH OTHER.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.058
{\an8}I JUST HAVE TO GET
ALL MY TALKING OUT

02:22.141 --> 02:23.059
{\an8}BEFORE I SEE CHRISTOPHER.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.185
{\an8}HE SAYS THE SOUND OF MY VOICE

02:24.269 --> 02:26.896
{\an8}MAKES HIM WANNA KILL HIMSELF.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.565
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.401
{\an8}OUT OF MY SALON, GET OUT!

02:33.820 --> 02:34.779
{\an8}- BUT WHY?

02:34.863 --> 02:37.407
{\an8}- YOU CUT YOUR OWN BANGS.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.075
{\an8}- IT IS MY HAIR.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.077
{\an8}- NO, NO, IT'S MY HAIR.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.454
{\an8}YOU'RE JUST THE DIRT
FROM WHICH IT GROWS.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.747
{\an8}OUT!

02:44.831 --> 02:45.915
{\an8}- ARE WE STILL ON FOR TONIGHT?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.918
{\an8}- I SUPPOSE.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.628
{\an8}I'LL DO YOU,
BUT NOT YOUR HAIR.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.922
{\an8}SCRAM.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.424
{\an8}- HI, CHRISTOPHER.

02:54.507 --> 02:58.469
{\an8}- UGH!
THAT VOICE.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.932
{\an8}I NEED TO GO SOOTHE MY NERVES.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.436
{\an8}- WHAT A PUTZ.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.938
{\an8}YOU REALLY SHOULD
SWITCH TO PIERRE.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.981
{\an8}- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.274
{\an8}ISN'T PIERRE A LITTLE FLIRTY?

03:11.357 --> 03:14.402
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY.
HE'S GAY.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.532
{\an8}- ELKA, YOU SEXY BEAST!

03:22.201 --> 03:26.956
{\an8}I WANT TO SNAP YOU IN TWO
AND SUCK OUT THE MIDDLE.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.291
{\an8}- OH, PIERRE.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.626
{\an8}- THANK YOU, PIERRE.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.460
{\an8}THIS IS FOR YOU.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.963
{\an8}- PUT IT IN THE BANK,
SWEETHEART.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.798
{\an8}THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.675
{\an8}AND WHO IS THIS
BEAUTIFUL CREATURE?

03:37.759 --> 03:38.843
{\an8}YOUR SISTER?

03:38.927 --> 03:43.306
{\an8}- OLDER SISTER.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.725
{\an8}- BOTH OF YOU, COME ON BACK
AND LET'S GET YOU STARTED.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.143
{\an8}- OH, WAIT, NO, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M ALLOWED

03:47.226 --> 03:47.936
{\an8}TO SIT IN THE CHAIR YET.

03:48.019 --> 03:48.978
{\an8}YOU KNOW, CHRISTOPHER.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.440
- GIRLFRIEND, PLEASE!

03:52.523 --> 03:55.443
- ARE YOU SURE?
- ABSOLUTELY SURE.

03:55.526 --> 03:59.489
AND AS FOR YOU, IF THAT FABULOUS
TUSHY ISN'T IN THAT CHAIR

03:59.572 --> 04:02.075
IN 20 SECONDS, IT'S GONNA
BE IN MY HANDS.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.374
- IT'S OKAY.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.375
HE'S GAY.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.878
- YEAH. GOT THAT.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.713
- SO MUCH GORGEOUS
IN THIS ROOM,

04:15.797 --> 04:18.007
IT'S LIKE BEING BACKSTAGE
AT A DRAG SHOW.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.638
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHO TOLD YOU
YOU COULD SIT THERE?

04:23.721 --> 04:24.722
- I DID.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.933
- I TOLD YOU NEVER SPEAK
TO MY CLIENTS.

04:27.016 --> 04:30.395
I DON'T LIKE THEM TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE TALKING.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.021
- I COULD GO SIT
IN THE RECEPTION AREA.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.649
REALLY, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
- NOW YOU'VE UPSET MELANIE.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.651
SHAME ON YOU!
- YEAH, YEAH.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.069
- COME ON, SUGARBUNS.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.029
LET'S GO GET YOU SHAMPOOED.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.658
OH, IF I COULD BE
YOUR BRA FOR ONE DAY.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.451
WHAT AM I SAYING?
I'D GET NOTHING DONE!

04:47.954 --> 04:49.205
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
SPEAK.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.165
- WELL, IT'S BEEN ABOUT--

04:51.249 --> 04:53.209
- NOT YOU, YOUR HAIR!

04:53.293 --> 04:55.586
WHAT HAS SHE DONE TO YOU?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.714
RUN HER GREASY FINGERS
THROUGH YOU?

04:57.797 --> 04:59.215
HUH?

04:59.298 --> 05:00.758
TRY ON SOME HOT GIRL'S HAT

05:00.842 --> 05:03.386
SHE'S 20 YEARS TOO OLD FOR?

05:03.469 --> 05:06.431
- IT WAS JUST A BERET,
I SWEAR.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.559
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

05:09.642 --> 05:13.021
- OH, MY GOD, HOW DID
YOU GUYS FIND ME?

05:13.104 --> 05:14.397
- WE HAVE OUR WAYS.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.898
- YOU FOLLOWED ME,
DIDN'T YOU?

05:15.982 --> 05:19.277
- YES, THAT IS OUR WAY.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.528
- I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU TWO.

05:20.611 --> 05:24.073
{\an1}- OH, RELAX, WE JUST WANTED TO
SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.242
STILL WANNA SEE IT.

05:26.325 --> 05:27.577
- EXCUSE ME, I DON'T
COME TO YOUR WORK

05:27.660 --> 05:30.747
AND KNOCK THE MOP
OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.914
- RUDE TO CUSTOMERS.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.750
VERY UN-CLEVELAND.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.418
- YOU, GO GET SHAMPOOED.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.754
YOU TWO, TIME TO LEAVE.
BUH-BYE.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.089
- YEAH. BUH-BYE.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.258
- ONE QUESTION BEFORE I GO.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.927
IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR BLOW OUTS
LAST 12 DAYS?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.554
- NO.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.972
14.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.768
16 IF THE BITCH
FOLLOWS MY INSTRUCTIONS.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.394
- HE'S SO MEAN.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.271
- I KNOW, I LOVE HIM ALREADY.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.106
YOU HAVE TO DO MY HAIR, TODAY.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.900
- [chuckles]
I'M BOOKED.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.611
- YEAH, YEAH, THERE'S ALWAYS
ROOM IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.945
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE?

06:03.029 --> 06:08.326
- $30.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.577
- LOOK, WE'RE NOT
GONNA GET ANYWHERE

06:09.660 --> 06:10.912
IF YOU INSIST
ON JOKING AROUND.

06:10.995 --> 06:14.791
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.919
- IF YOUR BLOW OUTS ARE AS GOOD
AS I THINK THEY ARE,

06:18.002 --> 06:20.129
YOU COULD BE CHARGING
TEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.672
- OH, PEOPLE
WOULDN'T PAY THAT.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.007
- OF COURSE THEY WOULD.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.300
NOTHING'S MORE SEDUCTIVE

06:24.383 --> 06:26.594
THAN THE ILLUSION
OF EXCLUSIVITY.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.471
- I HAVE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT TAKING

06:28.554 --> 06:29.972
THE SALON IN A NEW DIRECTION.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.933
- YEAH, LIKE OUT OF 1975?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.810
I MEAN, WHAT IS
WITH THIS AREA OVER HERE

06:33.893 --> 06:36.521
WITH THE HOODED DRIERS
AND THE DOG PHOTOS?

06:36.604 --> 06:38.272
- YEAH, THIS AREA HAS TO GO.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.315
- THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.900
PIERRE, GET OUT HERE.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.985
- WHAT IS IT?
- YOU'RE FIRED.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.320
- WHAT?

06:44.403 --> 06:46.572
LET ME LATHER, RINSE
AND REPEAT THAT.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.658
WHAT?!

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, THIS IS NOT
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.788
- QUIET, ROBOT.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.456
I'M TAKING THE SALON
IN A NEW DIRECTION.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.125
I'M TIRED OF YOU
HOLDING ME BACK.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.835
- YOU WANT ME OUT?
I'M OUT.

06:58.918 --> 06:59.961
- GOOD.
- GOOD!

07:00.044 --> 07:02.463
- FINE.
- FINE!

07:02.547 --> 07:03.464
- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.133
- THE PISSANT FIRED ME.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.844
SOMEHOW HE'S GOT AN IDEA
THAT I'M HOLDING HIM BACK.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.722
BUT IN THE WORDS OF ABBA,
"THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL."

07:14.100 --> 07:15.893
- NOW WHERE WOULD CHRISTOPHER
GET THE IDEA

07:15.977 --> 07:18.771
THAT PIERRE'S
HOLDING HIM BACK?

07:20.773 --> 07:22.984
- WHEREVER PIERRE IS GOING,
WE'RE GOING TOO.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.695
RIGHT, MELANIE?
- UH...

07:25.778 --> 07:27.238
- COME ON, LET'S JUST
STORM OUT OF HERE.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.698
- YEAH, BUT WOULDN'T
MY STORMING LOOK BETTER

07:28.781 --> 07:30.032
IF MY HAIR WAS
FRESHLY BLOWN OUT?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.909
- NOW, MELANIE.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.911
- COME ON, YOU GUYS.

07:33.995 --> 07:39.333
- I WOULD, BUT I THINK AN
APPOINTMENT JUST OPENED UP.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.460
- SKINNY, IN THE CHAIR.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.964
SKINNIER, GO GET SHAMPOO.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.549
- WHICH IS WHICH?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.343
- HE'S TRYING TO SOW DISSENTION
BETWEEN US.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.180
THE MAN IS A GENIUS.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.401
- I WAS MINUTES AWAY FROM
GETTING A BLOW OUT,

08:05.484 --> 08:08.279
AND INSTEAD I GET KICKED OUT
WITH MY HAIR STILL WET.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.157
MY HAIR DRIED...NATURALLY.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.953
- I THINK IT MAKES
YOU LOOK YOUNG.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.914
LIKE YOU WENT SWIMMING
AT THE BEACH

08:17.997 --> 08:21.584
AND DROVE HOME
IN A CONVERTIBLE.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.462
THEN...GOT HIT BY LIGHTNING.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.883
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
SHOWED UP AT THE SALON.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.301
- WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T
WANT US THERE,

08:30.384 --> 08:31.594
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.763
- I DID.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.556
LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.475
- WELL, I DIDN'T HEAR IT.
- OF COURSE NOT.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.644
THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE YOU
HEAR ANYTHING

08:39.727 --> 08:41.479
IS TO MENTION
YOUR AGENT CALLED.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.606
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
TAKING THIS OUT ON ME.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.608
JOY'S THE ONE WHO SAID,
"WHO CARES HOW MELANIE FEELS?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.944
LET'S FOLLOW HER."

08:48.027 --> 08:50.655
- I TOLD YOU THAT
IN CONFIDENCE.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.824
AND I DIDN'T SAY IT.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.826
LOOK, SHE'S THE ONE THAT GOT
PIERRE FIRED.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.662
- NO, NO, NO THAT
WAS MELANIE'S FAULT.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.121
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN GETTING
SECRET BLOW OUTS,

08:59.205 --> 09:00.331
THIS NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.959
<i>J'ACCUSE!</i>

09:03.042 --> 09:05.253
- OKAY, LET'S JUST STOP.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.796
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME
TENSION HERE.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.090
AND I THINK WE HAVE ALL
NOTICED THAT WE HAVE BEEN

09:09.173 --> 09:12.635
GETTING ON EACH OTHER'S
NERVES LATELY.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.804
SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD
IDEA IF WE JUST CLEAR THE AIR

09:14.887 --> 09:19.308
AND VENT OUR FRUSTRATIONS
IN A CALM AND RESPECTFUL MANNER.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.519
- OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
- I'M WILLING TO TRY.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.647
- AND I'LL START BY SAYING
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.693
BUT, UH, LATELY,
YOU HAVE A BEEN A LITTLE,

09:28.776 --> 09:31.779
SHALL WE SAY, DISRESPECTFUL.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.322
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN--

09:33.406 --> 09:37.451
- WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER
HERE, MELANIE.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.620
- THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.372
YOU BARELY LISTEN TO ME.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.666
- BECAUSE YOU TAKE FOREVER
TO GET TO THE POINT.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.835
NOW I CAN SAY WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BOTH OF YOU IN TWO WORDS.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.671
YOU'RE A WIMP AND
YOU'RE A BUMMER.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.216
- IN WHAT WAY AM I BUMMER?

09:52.300 --> 09:53.884
- WELL, YOU'RE ALWAYS
POOH-POOHING THINGS

09:53.968 --> 09:57.513
AND YOUR "CAN'T DO"
ATTITUDE IS EXHAUSTING.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.348
- I WILL FILE THAT UNDER

09:59.432 --> 10:01.350
"THINGS VICTORIA SAYS
THAT MAKE NO SENSE"

10:01.434 --> 10:06.856
OR, TO AVOID REDUNDANCY,
"THINGS VICTORIA SAYS".

10:06.939 --> 10:08.607
- OKAY, COME ON, THAT'S NOT CALM
AND RESPECTFUL.

10:08.691 --> 10:13.029
- THANK GOD WE HAVE HALL MONITOR
MELANIE TO KEEP US IN LINE.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.406
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT HALL MONITOR

10:15.489 --> 10:18.367
WAS A RESPECTED POSITION
IN MY HIGH SCHOOL.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.369
IF YOU WANTED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM,

10:20.453 --> 10:23.831
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH ME.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.418
- WHILE WE'RE ON MELANIE,
DO YOU HAVE TO BE

10:27.501 --> 10:30.087
SO DAMN FRIENDLY
TO EVERYONE WE RUN INTO?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.923
- YOU KNOW, JUST ONCE I WOULD
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO

10:33.007 --> 10:36.302
TO THE GROCERY STORE WITHOUT
BEING INTRODUCED TO THE BAG BOY.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.887
- [sharp laugh]
LIKE YOU'VE EVER BEEN

10:37.970 --> 10:39.138
TO A GROCERY STORE.

10:39.221 --> 10:39.889
I'M THE ONE THAT DOES
ALL THE SHOPPING.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.349
- THAT IS SO NOT FAIR.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.892
I MAKE THE LISTS,
YOU DO THE SHOPPING,

10:42.975 --> 10:44.935
AND JOY DRINKS ALL THE VODKA.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.064
- HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO SIT THROUGH ONE OF YOUR

10:48.147 --> 10:50.024
"IT'S SO HARD BEING FAMOUS"
STORIES?

10:50.107 --> 10:51.067
- I'M SORRY.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.069
AM I SERIOUSLY BEING ATTACKED

10:53.152 --> 10:56.739
FOR BEING A CELEBRITY?

10:56.822 --> 11:00.493
- NEWSFLASH, THE INS AND OUTS
OF THE LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE

11:00.576 --> 11:02.453
WHERE YOU PORTRAYED A SEXY
MANICURIST WHO PLAYED

11:02.536 --> 11:05.039
BY HER OWN RULES, AREN'T
AS INTERESTING AS YOU THINK.

11:05.122 --> 11:09.418
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT
LIFETIME HAD ITS BEST RATINGS

11:09.502 --> 11:12.254
OF THE YEAR WITH
<i>YOU'RE SOAKING IN IT.</i>

11:15.966 --> 11:17.927
- WHAT EXACTLY WERE
THE MANICURIST RULES

11:18.010 --> 11:18.969
SHE WAS BREAKING ANYWAY?

11:19.053 --> 11:21.931
- AND HERE COME THE QUESTIONS.

11:22.014 --> 11:22.765
- WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

11:22.848 --> 11:24.850
- IT MEANS LIVING
WITH YOU IS LIKE

11:24.934 --> 11:26.394
A NEVER-ENDING GAME
OF <i> JEOPARDY.</i>

11:26.477 --> 11:28.604
EVERYTHING IS IN THE FORM
OF A QUESTION!

11:28.687 --> 11:31.232
- WHERE IN THE WORLD
WOULD YOU GET THAT IDEA?

11:31.315 --> 11:34.318
- AND THERE'S
OUR DAILY DOUBLE.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.569
- SO WHAT?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.405
ARE THERE WORSE THINGS
IN THE WORLD?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.240
AND YES, I REALIZE THOSE ARE
BOTH QUESTIONS

11:39.323 --> 11:41.283
TO WHICH THERE IS ONE ANSWER.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.412
[blows raspberry]

11:45.496 --> 11:48.290
- WELL...

11:48.374 --> 11:50.126
THIS WAS CERTAINLY PRODUCTIVE.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.710
I THINK I'M DONE HERE.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.463
- ME TOO.
- ME TOO.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.424
BUT SERIOUSLY,
DID MY AGENT CALL?

11:56.507 --> 12:01.262
both: NO!

12:01.345 --> 12:04.473
- HELLO, TRAITORS.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.184
- PIERRE, JOY IS SO VERY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.438
- YES, VICTORIA WOULD LIKE
TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANY PART

12:10.521 --> 12:11.981
SHE PLAYED
IN YOU GETTING FIRED.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.775
- PLEASE, LIKE THE GREAT GLORIA
GAYNOR ONCE SAID,

12:14.859 --> 12:17.695
I WILL SURVIVE.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.948
BESIDES, WHO COULD BE UNHAPPY

12:21.031 --> 12:25.286
SURROUNDED BY
THREE GORGEOUS WOMEN?

12:25.369 --> 12:28.372
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET,
BUT THERE'S FOUR OF US HERE.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.625
- I KNOW.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.961
YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT HAIR.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.796
HOLY TOLEDO.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.631
IT'S A MESS!

12:40.384 --> 12:42.386
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE FUN
WITH THIS, SHALL WE?

12:42.470 --> 12:45.681
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
GOING A TINY BIT SHORTER?

12:45.764 --> 12:47.016
A LITTLE BRIGHTER?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.726
- YEAH, I HAVE, ACTUALLY.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.603
- THEN LEAVE IT TO PIERRE.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.860
- OH, GOD.

12:57.943 --> 12:58.986
- GOOD LORD.

12:59.069 --> 13:02.448
- YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.497
- ALL RIGHT, DONE.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.831
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WEAR
THIS WIG UNTIL IT GROWS BACK.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.832
- [gasps]

13:11.916 --> 13:14.210
OH, MY GOD, IT'S PERFECT.

13:14.293 --> 13:18.380
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE MY OLD HAIR.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.673
- THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M A GENIUS.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.050
SAY IT.
- YOU'RE A GENIUS.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.385
- STOP KISSING MY ASS.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.347
- THIS IS A RELIEF.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.599
NORMALLY I'D BE EXCITED TO GO
HOME AND SHOW MY ROOMMATES,

13:28.682 --> 13:30.559
BUT, OH, AFTER THE
FIGHT WE JUST HAD...

13:30.643 --> 13:32.019
LET'S JUST SAY
THE GLOVES CAME OFF.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.938
WE'RE NOT EVEN SPEAKING
TO EACH OTHER.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.065
- I DON'T CARE.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.859
- IT'S JUST THAT IT'S NOT ONLY
THIS ONE THING.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.780
LATELY THEY'VE BEEN--
- DRIVING ME CRAZY.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.074
I MEAN IT IS KIND OF REMARKABLE
THAT WE GOT ALONG

13:45.157 --> 13:46.700
AS LONG AS WE DID.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.454
A LONELY BRITISH EXPAT, AN
ALL-AMERICAN GIRL NEXT DOOR,

13:50.538 --> 13:54.250
AND AN UNDERAPPRECIATED, THOUGH
HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER ACTRESS

13:54.333 --> 13:57.294
LIVING AWAY
FROM THE LIMELIGHT.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.963
I WON'T INSULT
YOUR INTELLIGENCE

13:59.046 --> 14:01.257
BY TELLING YOU WHO
THE BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS IS.

14:01.340 --> 14:06.929
- YEAH.
I DON'T CARE.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.265
- OH, IT WAS
A HORRIBLE ARGUMENT.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.601
BUT IN MY DEFENSE,
MELANIE IS OBNOXIOUSLY NICE.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.230
- I DON'T CARE.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.733
- AND JOY, I MEAN, SHE HAS SUCH
AMAZINGLY LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.986
IT'S PROBABLY WHY SHE'S
ALWAYS FALLING INTO BED

14:22.069 --> 14:25.406
WITH THE MOST UNAVAILABLE MEN.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.075
- GO ON.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.286
- I HAVE HALF A MIND TO--

14:30.369 --> 14:32.788
- TRY TO FIND
A PLACE OF MY OWN.

14:32.871 --> 14:36.458
- I DON'T CARE.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.920
LISTEN, SWEETIE, I GOT
A CLIENT COMING, SO COULD YOU,

14:40.004 --> 14:43.966
YOU KNOW, FOLD UP THE COUCH
AND BEAT IT?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.135
- WAIT, WHAT ABOUT GETTING MY
HAIR BLOWN OUT?

14:46.218 --> 14:49.013
- OH, BABE, SORRY, NO TIME.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.475
COME HERE.

14:56.895 --> 14:59.315
THERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.691
CALL ME.

15:00.774 --> 15:01.942
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, FOR SURE.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.112
- [silently]
I LOVE YOU.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.829
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:13.912 --> 15:18.167
- I ASKED YOU FIRST.
- I WAS HERE FIRST.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.045
- IT SEEMS THAT WE
ARE AT A STALEMATE.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.342
- WELL, CLEARLY WE'RE ALL HERE
FOR THE SAME REASON.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.926
WE'RE ALL THINKING
ABOUT MOVING OUT.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.012
- YES, AND OBVIOUSLY WE
ALL SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT

15:30.095 --> 15:31.305
FOR THIS APARTMENT
AT THE SALON.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.682
- NO, I FOUND IT
A DIFFERENT WAY.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.892
- YOU FOLLOWED US?

15:34.975 --> 15:40.314
- THAT IS MY WAY.

15:40.397 --> 15:43.692
- FINE, WE'RE ALL HERE TO FIND
AN APARTMENT OF OUR OWN

15:43.776 --> 15:45.694
SO LET'S JUST LOOK
AT IT ON OUR OWN.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.571
- FINE.
- FINE.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.705
- THIS PLACE IS SAD.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.706
- REALLY SAD.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.751
- THIS PLACE IS WHERE SAD COMES
TO HANG ITSELF.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.049
- MAYBE...I'M JUST SAD BECAUSE
I REALLY HATE IT WHEN WE FIGHT.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.886
- ME TOO.
- OH, ME TOO.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.763
LET'S NOT BEAT OURSELVES UP.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.556
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN LIVING
TOGETHER FOR THREE YEARS.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.724
WE WERE DUE.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.059
- AND IT'S NOT
THE END OF THE WORLD

16:17.142 --> 16:18.727
THAT WE WANNA
FIND OUR OWN PLACE.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.020
I MEAN, WE ARE ADULTS.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.398
- EXACTLY. WE ALL HAD OUR OWN
PLACES IN L.A.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.234
- MM-HMM, AND WE CAN STILL
HANG OUT LIKE WE DID IN L.A.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.611
- AND HAVE SLEEPOVERS
LIKE WE DID IN L.A.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.530
- AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING,
TALK ABOUT HOW FUN

16:29.613 --> 16:34.410
IT WOULD BE TO SOMEDAY
ALL LIVE TOGETHER.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.413
LIKE WE DO NOW.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.248
- WE'RE ACTUALLY
LIVING OUR DREAM.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.709
AND TO THINK WE WERE
ABOUT TO THROW IT AWAY

16:41.792 --> 16:43.127
OVER A BUNCH OF NONSENSE.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.255
- IT MAY BE WEIRD THAT WOMEN
OUR AGE LIVE TOGETHER,

16:46.338 --> 16:48.298
BUT I REALLY LIKE IT.
- ME TOO.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.466
- ME TOO.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.051
- OKAY, THEN LET'S JUST
GO HOME

16:51.135 --> 16:52.803
AND PRETEND NONE OF THIS
EVER HAPPENED.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.388
- BUT WE STILL HAVE
A MESS TO CLEAN UP

16:54.471 --> 16:55.973
AND ELKA'S STILL MAD AT US
FOR GETTING PIERRE FIRED.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.100
- WHO'S PIERRE?

16:58.183 --> 17:01.603
- YOUR AGENT CALLED.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.439
PIERRE IS THE GUY
WE GOT FIRED.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.107
- AND WE HAVE TO GET HIM
HIS JOB BACK.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.152
- CHRISTOPHER WILL NEVER TAKE
HIM BACK, HE'S TOO OUTDATED.

17:08.234 --> 17:09.903
- SO LET'S GIVE HIM
A MAKEOVER.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.240
- I LOOK RIDICULOUS.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.284
WITHOUT MY NECKERCHIEF
AND MY WHITE BUCKS,

17:15.367 --> 17:18.162
I FEEL A LITTLE...GAY.

17:21.707 --> 17:25.669
- YOU ARE TWO SCOOPS OF YUMMY
WITH A SIDE OF KA-POW!

17:25.752 --> 17:27.588
OH. HELLO, PIERRE.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.797
- PIERRE!

17:28.881 --> 17:31.884
YOU TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.971
AND TO THINK
I SLEPT WITH YOU.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.269
- SHE'LL BE BACK.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.480
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.857
- ALL RIGHT, I POACHED
SOME OF YOUR CLIENTS.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.651
I THOUGHT I COULD RUN
THE SALON WITHOUT YOU,

17:49.735 --> 17:53.989
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT MOST
OF OUR BUSINESS IS OLDER LADIES.

17:54.072 --> 17:54.990
NO OFFENSE.

17:55.073 --> 17:58.660
all: WHY WOULD I BE OFFENDED?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.329
- IT TURNS OUT,
IN THIS ECONOMY,

18:00.412 --> 18:03.457
NO ONE WANTS TO PAY
$300 FOR A BLOW DRY.

18:03.540 --> 18:08.045
IN FACT, THESE THREE IDIOTS
ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT DID.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.755
- YOUR HAIR DOESN'T LOOK DONE.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.674
- SHH! LET HIM TALK.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.760
- SO, UH, YOU WANT ME BACK.

18:14.843 --> 18:18.138
- YES, DAD.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.515
- DAD?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.683
- I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS...

18:21.767 --> 18:24.061
THAT I WON'T ASK.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.521
- BUT NO MORE SCENTED CANDLES.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.855
- AND THEN NO MORE YELLING
AT THE CUSTOMERS.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.190
- THEN NO MORE ABBA.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.025
- AND IF YOU GET TO DATE
THE CUSTOMERS,

18:30.108 --> 18:31.360
SO DO I.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.403
- THEN BE MY GUEST.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.948
HOW ABOUT IT, SWEET CHEEKS?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.157
WANNA HIT THE TOWN?

18:37.241 --> 18:39.785
- YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ME?

18:39.868 --> 18:42.162
- HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED
THAT I'VE BEEN HITTING ON YOU

18:42.246 --> 18:44.373
RELENTLESSLY FOR
THE PAST 20 YEARS?

18:44.456 --> 18:46.750
- BUT WE ALL THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE...

18:46.834 --> 18:48.502
- AN INSATIABLE LADIES' MAN?

18:48.585 --> 18:52.881
I GET THAT ALL THE TIME.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.384
I ASSURE YOU,
I'M A ONE-WOMAN GUY.

18:55.467 --> 18:59.930
- WELL, HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
SAY NO?

19:01.807 --> 19:03.725
- SWEET BARBRA STREISAND.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.688
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET
MY HANDS ON THOSE BUNS!

19:07.771 --> 19:10.440
HURRY UP!

19:10.524 --> 19:12.860
- IT'S OKAY.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.320
HE'S NOT GAY.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.577
- TO EVERYTHING GOING BACK
TO JUST THE WAY IT WAS.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.744
- YES, AND, ELKA,
THANK YOU

19:22.828 --> 19:24.371
FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.

19:24.454 --> 19:28.166
- ACTUALLY, I BOUGHT
IT FOR MYSELF.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.253
TO CELEBRATE
YOU GUYS MOVING OUT.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.592
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU
GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.634
- HOLD IT DOWN.

19:37.718 --> 19:41.930
