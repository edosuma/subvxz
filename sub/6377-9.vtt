00:12.263 --> 00:13.924
-Ginger, enough.
-Thank you.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.414
Humans.

00:48.007 --> 00:50.999
Honestly, Bill,
I don't know what you see in them.

02:42.121 --> 02:45.158
How did I end up with you people?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.823
Jesus.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.243
Mother Mary in heaven.

02:52.048 --> 02:55.632
I'm so sorry, Mama. I'm so sorry.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.292
When Ginger is finished,
glamour her for me.

02:58.471 --> 03:01.429
Are you sure? She's been glamoured
one too many times already.

03:01.599 --> 03:05.512
-Who knows how much of her is left.
-lt's either that or turn her.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.771
You want her?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.808
Please, I'm not that desperate.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.975
-Glamour it is.
-Excellent.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.316
Come. I'll buy you a Blood.

03:30.753 --> 03:31.788
Thank you.

03:31.962 --> 03:35.125
How do you stomach that stuff?
Don't you find it metallic and vile?

03:35.299 --> 03:38.291
I don't think about it.
It's sustenance, that's all.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.467
-What?
-If you're their poster boy...

03:43.641 --> 03:47.133
...the mainstreaming movement
is in very deep trouble.

03:47.353 --> 03:51.972
Tru Blood. It keeps you alive,
but it will bore you to death.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.980
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

03:54.151 --> 03:57.769
You killed a vampire, Bill.
For a human.

03:58.823 --> 04:01.860
-What are we gonna do about this?
-What do you have in mind?

04:02.034 --> 04:03.774
-|'|| take the girl.
-No.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.077
You can have anyone.
Why do you want her?

04:11.252 --> 04:13.334
Why do you want her?

04:14.338 --> 04:16.954
You're not in love with her, are you?

04:17.133 --> 04:19.624
-Sookie must be protected.
-That sounds like an edict.

04:19.802 --> 04:22.794
But it couldn't be,
because I would know about that.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.515
Admit it.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.931
You love her.

04:29.854 --> 04:34.348
lfl hadn't done what I did,
would you have let his disloyalty stand?

04:34.525 --> 04:37.983
Whatever I did to Longshadow,
I would not have done in front of witnesses.

04:38.154 --> 04:40.486
Especially not vampire witnesses.

04:42.158 --> 04:43.864
Not smart, Bill.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.534
Not smart at all.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.122
All I'm saying is,
Lafayette didn't have to kidnap him.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.586
-And I'm pretty sure he left with some V.
-Hey.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.378
If you wanna make the same arrangement
with Eddie Lafayette's got, have at it.

05:05.556 --> 05:10.391
This was just the only thing I could think of
to get you out of blowing your first vampire.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.311
You done this before, haven't you?

05:14.482 --> 05:18.851
-Done what?
-This. Kidnapping vampires.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.899
Jesus. I should have known
something wasn't right...

05:23.073 --> 05:26.440
...the second you walked into my life
carrying that big bag of crazy.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.702
Any woman with a purse that big's
bound to have something in it...

05:29.872 --> 05:32.409
-...I don't wanna know about.
-Jason.

05:32.583 --> 05:37.748
Baby, you're sweet,
but you've gotta mellow out.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.841
The fuck is this hippie music?

06:01.529 --> 06:03.440
Put these on.

06:04.406 --> 06:08.319
Oh, thank you, but I'm fine, really.

06:08.494 --> 06:11.361
I'm just gonna dry out my hair
and be on my way.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.779
You're not going anywhere.

06:12.957 --> 06:15.949
Eric and your boyfriend
aren't nearly done talking just yet.

06:17.127 --> 06:21.245
-ls Bill in some kind of trouble?
-That's for the boys to figure out.

06:21.423 --> 06:25.883
Right now, what you need to do
is change out of your clothes.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.638
There's vampire in your cleavage.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.049
Okay.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.343
Allow me.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.900
Thank you.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.814
I'm beginning to understand the fuss
everyone's making over you.

06:50.786 --> 06:54.745
Oh, hey there, Pam.
Oh, who's your new friend?

06:54.915 --> 06:58.999
-Ginger, Sookie. Sookie, Ginger.
-Nice to meet you, Sookie.

06:59.461 --> 07:02.077
Right. Nice to meet you too.

07:02.256 --> 07:06.169
Oh, you don't have to be so scared.
They're really very nice here.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.504
Here.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.340
-You got him?
-Yeah.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.642
Tape the windows shut. Here.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.183
Clear this out.
We gotta clear all this shit out.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.154
Lift his legs.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.283
-Ready?
-How's this gonna go?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.035
Tie his arm there.

07:41.754 --> 07:43.210
What?

07:45.049 --> 07:48.166
I guess I got a little paranoid after 9/11.

07:48.344 --> 07:52.883
No, because after New York and DO,
terrorists were gonna come to Bon Temps.

07:53.057 --> 07:56.140
-And I said I was paranoid.
-Get his feet.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.263
What are you gonna do to me?

07:58.437 --> 08:02.305
Yeah, I was kind of
wondering that myself.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.314
We're gonna drink from him.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.725
-And then what?
-Yeah?

08:05.903 --> 08:08.815
Dude, I got this. What's the plan?

08:08.989 --> 08:12.607
Jason, can you please
try to live in the now with me.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.325
I do live in the now.

08:15.496 --> 08:18.863
In fact, I've gone entire months
without thinking about shit.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.999
But the truth is,
right now, the now kind of sucks.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.832
And if we both can't admit that,
then we are 100 percent fucked.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.389
-Who wants the first taste?
-I ain't doing it. Not like this.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.389
-Thank you.
-I said, stop talking to me.

08:37.559 --> 08:41.017
Come with me, baby.
Don't let your fear get in your way.

08:41.188 --> 08:45.306
Look, it ain't fear, all right? It's just....

08:49.029 --> 08:51.406
He's looking me right in the eye.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.323
It ain't right.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.613
Look at him.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.280
-Fine. I'll see you when | get back.
-Wait, wait, wait.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.369
Ain't you supposed to cut it
with aspirin?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.911
No, there's no risk of clotting
when the V's this fresh.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.725
My God.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.148
You look...

09:30.654 --> 09:32.394
...really happy.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.823
Come on, baby.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.744
Come with me.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.040
Don't. Don't do it.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.301
I said, don't talk to me.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.856
What exactly did you do to my mama?

10:17.034 --> 10:18.865
You were here. You saw it.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.869
Yeah, but I wanna know exactly
how and why it worked.

10:22.039 --> 10:25.998
I'm already taking a monster leap of faith
even considering this demon crap.

10:26.168 --> 10:29.752
Fine, then. It's like this.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.004
Your mind, your body...

10:32.174 --> 10:35.712
...it's just a physical manifestation
ofyoursouL

10:43.977 --> 10:46.559
-How's your mama doing?
-She's doing great.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.392
But she believes in shit like this. I don't.

10:50.234 --> 10:52.350
If you don't believe...

10:52.528 --> 10:55.144
...then why did you come
all the way out here tonight?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.109
How much it'll cost me?

11:03.747 --> 11:06.079
-Seven-ninety-nine, ninety-five.
-What?

11:06.250 --> 11:08.206
Seven-ninety-nine, ninety-five.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.835
-Cup of rum's on the house.
-Well, my mama paid less than half that.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.418
What I do takes varying amounts
of energy...

11:15.592 --> 11:19.505
...and involves varying amounts of risk.
Now, what you got inside you...

11:19.680 --> 11:22.763
...is much more powerful
than what your mama had.

11:22.933 --> 11:26.721
-Much more dangerous too.
-l'm worse than her?

11:27.604 --> 11:30.437
I once found that woman on the ground,
eating her own vomit...

11:30.607 --> 11:34.600
...because she didn't wanna waste
the alcohol she lost bringing it all up.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.281
Think about it.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.195
But not for too long.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.748
You can't afford
to keep pushing people away.

11:50.878 --> 11:54.462
Your loneliness is spreading to your eyes.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.669
It's becoming a part of who you are.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.218
You're one hell of a saleswoman,
aren't you?

12:04.182 --> 12:06.173
Next time you're alone...

12:06.351 --> 12:09.593
...stand in the mirror
and count backwards from 10.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.979
If you can get all the way down to zero...

12:13.150 --> 12:15.141
...then I'm wrong.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.861
But if you can't stand your own company
for 10 seconds...

12:20.574 --> 12:24.066
...how you gonna expect to do it
for the rest of your life?

12:30.918 --> 12:34.877
-So you're not in any trouble?
-A simple slap on the wrist, that's all.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.753
You swear? Pam made it sound like--

12:36.924 --> 12:39.006
Pam was turned
almost a hundred years ago...

12:39.176 --> 12:43.340
...and yet somehow still behaves
as though every day were Halloween.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.765
She's all drama and theatrics.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.846
I assure you, everything's gonna be fine.

12:54.024 --> 12:58.688
I'm gonna take a shower.
I still feel like there's blood all over me.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.238
Don't look up.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.668
Wait, wait, wait.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.253
First we have to thank the vampire...

13:22.427 --> 13:25.965
...for the gifts
that he's bestowed upon us.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.304
-We are grateful--
-Fuck you.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.843
--for your gift to us.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.812
Ignore him.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.669
Can you see it?

14:00.424 --> 14:02.289
Where are we?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.670
Nowhere.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.968
Everywhere.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.679
Together.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.125
Aren't you tired?

14:46.720 --> 14:50.212
Every time | close my eyes,
I see her face.

14:50.474 --> 14:53.807
-Your cat?
-Gran.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.845
But now that you mention it,
Tina's in there too.

14:59.858 --> 15:03.897
You do know that I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you?

15:04.905 --> 15:07.271
That I am here for you...

15:07.908 --> 15:08.943
...to protect you.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.278
Armd what if H dorm't warma
maed to be protactad?

15:11.453 --> 15:13.785
What if wanting to be protected
makes me feel...

15:13.955 --> 15:17.743
...like the helpless little girl | used to be
all over again?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.874
SooMe.

15:20.462 --> 15:24.171
All of the things
that you need to be protected from...

15:24.341 --> 15:26.502
...all of the trouble you're in...

15:27.385 --> 15:29.671
...you're in because of me.

15:29.846 --> 15:35.512
So you needing to be protected
has nothing to do with you...

15:35.685 --> 15:38.017
...or who you are.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.524
All of it is my fault.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.731
So why don't you just go to sleep...

15:51.868 --> 15:54.655
...and let me be the one
to worry about it?

15:55.622 --> 15:59.865
Bill, all the trouble I'm in...

16:00.043 --> 16:02.534
...it's mine. I chose it.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.044
-I chose it when I chose you.
-Yes, but--

16:05.215 --> 16:08.002
Don't you think
I wanna blame somebody else?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.881
But what happened to my Gran...

16:12.055 --> 16:15.218
...and now to poor Tina, it's my fault.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.225
And it's sweet of you
to try to take it on for me...

16:18.395 --> 16:22.729
...but if I let you, I'd be so mad at you,
I'd never be able to look at you again.

16:22.899 --> 16:27.643
And right now your face
is just about the only thing getting me by.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.648
So why don't we just leave it on me,
okay?

16:35.245 --> 16:36.906
Very well.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.048
Night, Bill.

17:16.077 --> 17:19.365
-You're a fucking dead woman.
-Oh, my God!

17:21.291 --> 17:23.498
Honestly, you are like a little boy.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.784
Did I scare you?

17:26.379 --> 17:27.789
Yeah.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.460
Come here, lie down.
I wanna show you something.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.634
-What we looking at?
-The trees.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.842
But we're not just looking,
we're listening too.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.261
Listening to trees?

17:47.192 --> 17:51.606
-Can you hear that?
-lt's like the leaves are talking.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.736
They're laughing.

17:54.783 --> 17:58.526
Yeah, because they're ticklish.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.157
That's right.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.168
-Amy?
-Yeah, baby.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.955
We still high?

18:12.550 --> 18:14.677
No, baby.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.840
Because I don't normally talk like this.

18:18.014 --> 18:22.257
Plus, I'm feeling kind of lightheaded too.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.678
You're talking like this
because your mind is starting to open up.

18:26.856 --> 18:31.099
And you're lightheaded because you haven't
eaten anything. So here.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.645
Have an almond, they're raw.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.827
Oh, my God.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.074
-That is crazy good.
-We gotta change the way you eat.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.958
Raw foods. Nothing processed.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.371
Because the cleaner the body,
the cleaner the soul...

18:52.549 --> 18:54.631
...the cleaner the experience.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.135
Cleaner than last night?

19:00.056 --> 19:02.138
Much cleaner.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.984
Amy!

19:18.158 --> 19:21.275
He'll stop. He'll stop.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.910
Jason!

19:29.044 --> 19:31.581
Ain't you worried
somebody's gonna hear him?

19:31.755 --> 19:34.417
You live in the middle of nowhere
of the middle of nowhere.

19:38.428 --> 19:42.762
Did I say he was? All I'm saying is....

19:44.267 --> 19:47.350
My truck, for example.
It ain't a person either.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.762
But I still fill it with gas
and give it oil from time to time.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.680
You're saying we should feed him now?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.271
-Ain't he gonna die if we don't?
-Who cares?

19:59.324 --> 20:02.282
ljust—- I still think we should have a plan,
that's all.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.408
I do have one.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.533
-Oh, yeah?
-And here it is.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.540
Everything's gonna work out,
because it has to.

20:12.128 --> 20:17.543
-That ain't a plan.
-Because when I am with you, what I feel....

20:17.717 --> 20:20.754
I've never felt that
with anybody else ever before.

20:22.889 --> 20:28.225
And I'm a person that a lot of bad stuff
has happened to in the past...

20:28.395 --> 20:30.977
...and so I deserve this.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.139
I love you.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.828
Oh, my God.

20:49.082 --> 20:52.415
Oh, my God. I mean,
why is it that we all need to be loved...

20:52.585 --> 20:57.500
...but then when somebody finally says,
"I love you," people just run scared.

20:58.133 --> 21:03.673
I love you, Jason Stackhouse,
whether you like it or not.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.338
I'm not afraid to admit it.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.682
Know what?

21:13.189 --> 21:14.690
You're right.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.520
Fuck it.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.069
I love you too.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.873
Say it again.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.544
-I love--
-Come on.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.706
You get it once, that's all.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.755
Ten...

21:45.096 --> 21:46.757
...nine...

21:47.056 --> 21:48.512
...eight—-

21:49.225 --> 21:51.887
Don't you knock?
What if I was doing something private?

21:52.061 --> 21:55.428
I taught you that was a sin against God.
If I walk in on you doing it...

21:55.607 --> 21:57.472
-...it's your problem.
-What do you want?

21:57.650 --> 22:00.642
Sam Merlotte's here to see you.
You ain't sleeping with him?

22:00.820 --> 22:03.562
-What makes you jump to that conclusion?
-He brung flowers.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.232
Men only bring flowers if they already
slept with you and looking to again.

22:07.410 --> 22:11.244
That especially goes for white men,
as black men are less prone to grovel.

22:18.963 --> 22:22.421
To apologize for anything I said
that hurt your feelings...

22:22.592 --> 22:26.426
-...and sort things out between you and me.
-That's a load. It's sex he wants.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.086
Mama.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.263
-She drinking again?
-Nope.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.972
That's her, stone-cold sober.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.886
-Look, you should go.
-Why?

22:37.065 --> 22:39.602
Because I'm just too fucked-up for this.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.519
You're not even the most fucked-up person
in this house, much less this town.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.607
What do you think this is between us?

22:45.782 --> 22:48.774
We were clear from the beginning
it was just gonna be us fucking.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.568
-It's too late for that.
-What are you, a masochist?

22:55.083 --> 22:58.416
...or pinning my hopes on somebody
I can't have. I'm done with that.

22:58.836 --> 23:02.044
Like it or not, you've reminded me
that I'm a social animal.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.752
I'd rather deal with your fucked-up shit
than be alone.

23:04.926 --> 23:07.963
Here's some fucked-up shit for you.
Do you know that right now...

23:08.137 --> 23:10.469
...I have myself thinking
I have a demon inside me?

23:10.640 --> 23:14.508
The only way to get it out is have
some lady who lives in a bus in a swamp...

23:14.686 --> 23:18.850
...perform a $800 exorcism on me
that there's no way in hell I can afford?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.060
Yeah. So go ahead.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.476
Now tell me you still want
something more with me.

23:24.654 --> 23:27.612
Not if it's gonna be like this.
But I'd like it if we could--

23:27.782 --> 23:29.943
Well, we can't, all right?

23:30.118 --> 23:34.487
Look, just go, okay? Get out of here
and save us both a lot of misery.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.284
All right, I'll see you at work.

23:45.675 --> 23:49.418
-Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
-I know, right?

23:49.596 --> 23:52.053
So you guys having an engagement party
or what?

23:52.223 --> 23:54.555
We'd like to,
but I don't know where we'd throw it.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.433
You know, our place isn't big enough.

23:59.564 --> 24:02.180
You could have it here, if you like.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.768
Oh, thanks.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.434
-But I wouldn't wanna put you out.
-You wouldn't be.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.946
It'd be like any night,
except I'd close the place to the public...

24:10.116 --> 24:11.697
...for you and your dearest.

24:11.868 --> 24:15.031
Oh, wow, Sam, that would be amazing.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.367
Except I was thinking could we do it
in the warehouse next door?

24:18.541 --> 24:19.701
Or even outside?

24:19.876 --> 24:23.039
Because if we did it in here,
it'd feel like work, you know?

24:23.212 --> 24:24.668
You were thinking, huh?

24:24.839 --> 24:28.002
About the party
I only just now offered to throw for you?

24:30.553 --> 24:34.546
You are a spectacular man, Sam Merlotte.

24:34.724 --> 24:38.387
And you are one hell of a conniving suck-up
when you need to be.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.644
I'll cover the catering and the band.
The alcohol and all the other incidentals...

24:44.817 --> 24:46.478
-...are on you and Rene.
-Got it.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.315
And I may be conniving,
but I still mean it.

24:49.489 --> 24:52.231
You are gonna make some woman
extremely happy one day.

24:52.408 --> 24:55.571
Maybe someday I'll meet a woman
willing to take that chance with me.

24:55.745 --> 24:59.203
-Morning, Sookie.
-Ain't nothing good about this morning.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.804
"Secret Sauce"?
Who you fucking kidding?

25:16.974 --> 25:20.683
Since when is it right to call
mayonnaise a fucking secret?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.104
I don't know.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.227
I kind of like it, though.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.515
You can like it all you want to.

25:26.693 --> 25:27.933
It's still mayonnaise.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.609
What are you thinking?

25:32.031 --> 25:35.444
Thinking fucking roots
should learn where to grow.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.360
What?

25:44.961 --> 25:46.292
Wait. Rene.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.541
Wait!

25:49.716 --> 25:53.129
Hey! Hey! Rene!

25:53.302 --> 25:55.042
The fuck, man?

25:56.723 --> 25:59.135
-Shut it down.
-Get the fuck off me.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.469
-Asshole.
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

26:01.644 --> 26:04.306
-You got a screw loose?
-You could've killed me.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.813
I'm sorry, I know, but this ain'tjust
some root growing out of nowhere.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.474
It's connected to that tree.

26:10.319 --> 26:14.813
-Everything we see, man, it's all connected.
-The fuck are you talking about?

26:14.991 --> 26:16.652
You some kind of treehugger now?

26:16.826 --> 26:19.488
-You gonna kill your buddy to save a tree?
-Chill, son.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.282
-I could give a fuck if you're sorry.
-All right.

26:22.457 --> 26:25.824
I'm about to get married.
There are people that count on me.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.995
Okay, come on,
let's go get you cleaned up.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.010
Is everything all right, J?

26:40.975 --> 26:43.341
Tell me, Hoyt,
were you on the football team?

26:44.520 --> 26:45.851
No.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.935
-Were you on the football team?
-No, I wasn't.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.146
Then you do not call me J. You got that?

26:54.614 --> 26:56.354
Yeah.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.158
Yeah.

27:04.624 --> 27:05.909
I'm--

27:06.083 --> 27:08.119
Yeah, I'm sorry.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.876
Goddamn it, J.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.548
Goddamn it.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.842
-What can I get for you today?
-Your boss around?

27:23.017 --> 27:25.383
Tell him you're looking for him.
What can I get you?

27:25.561 --> 27:27.893
Don't know, I haven't decided yet.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.354
Then while you make up your mind...

27:30.525 --> 27:32.857
...how about I tell you
what you can get for me?

27:33.027 --> 27:36.190
I would love whoever's killing off
my family's head on a platter.

27:36.364 --> 27:38.104
Think you could arrange that for me?

27:38.282 --> 27:40.489
I don't appreciate your tone,
Miss Stackhouse.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.743
I don't appreciate officers of the law
enjoying casual lunches...

27:43.913 --> 27:46.074
...while there's a killer trying to hunt me.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.740
Did you know
he got into my house again last night?

27:48.918 --> 27:50.829
-He did?
-Yes, and he killed my cat.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.743
Cut her head off and took it with him.

27:52.922 --> 27:57.165
-How come you didn't call the station?
-All the station would've done is send you.

27:57.343 --> 28:01.086
You'd still be here acting as though
you don't know what you're gonna order...

28:01.264 --> 28:04.006
...even though you always wind up
having the cheeseburger.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.265
Detective Bellefleur, I'll take your order.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.096
-No, it's my table.
-I got it.

28:08.271 --> 28:11.058
Just take a break. It'll do you some good.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.773
What can I get for you?

28:19.323 --> 28:21.985
Go with the goddamn
cheeseburger and fries.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.461
Hey, you.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.878
Listen, you all right?

28:40.636 --> 28:42.422
Sometimes I wish I smoked, you know?

28:42.597 --> 28:46.590
So you could sneak outside without anybody
knowing something's wrong with you.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.471
Okay.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.479
I'm really sorry about your cat.

28:54.984 --> 28:57.191
Maybe I shouldn't have come in today.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.568
Yeah, I was gonna say, why did you?

28:59.739 --> 29:02.105
I don't know.
Maybe because lately it seems like...

29:02.283 --> 29:05.446
...if I called in sick every time
somebody I loved got murdered...

29:05.620 --> 29:07.576
...I'd never make it in for a day of work.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.739
-Don't you think Sam would understand?
-Iguess.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.535
-But if I went home, what would you do?
-Me? What's it got to do with me?

29:14.712 --> 29:17.829
With Arlene doing nothing
but showing off her ring...

29:18.007 --> 29:20.168
...you'd be the only one waiting tables.

29:20.843 --> 29:23.004
Yeah, she is gonna be a handful,
that one.

29:23.179 --> 29:27.388
Can you imagine what she was like
the first time she got married?

29:29.143 --> 29:32.180
What about you? You ever been married?

29:32.647 --> 29:37.141
Is this the part where the sister asks what
the girl's intentions are with her brother?

29:37.860 --> 29:40.693
Because right now,
I am all about protecting Jason.

29:42.365 --> 29:44.526
He misses you, Sookie.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.529
-Right.
-No, he does.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.694
I mean, between your grandma passing...

29:49.872 --> 29:52.238
...and then what happened aften/vards
with you....

29:53.292 --> 29:55.203
-He told you about that?
-He couldn't not.

29:55.378 --> 29:58.415
-I mean, he's a mess about it.
-Well, you wouldn't know it.

29:59.799 --> 30:03.417
Look, I know what you must think of him.

30:03.803 --> 30:07.011
And I get why you're mad at him, I do.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.217
But he loves you.

30:10.226 --> 30:13.559
You still got people around you
who love you.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.391
And all I can hope is that...

30:16.565 --> 30:20.524
...maybe one day,
I can be counted in among those people.

30:21.862 --> 30:25.775
You are way too good for him.
You know that, right?

30:25.950 --> 30:29.317
Of course I know that. I'm not stupid.

30:53.019 --> 30:56.762
You can call me all the names you want,
but I am conﬁdent in my position...

30:56.939 --> 31:00.431
...that when the day comes I meet
my Maker, it is I who will be allowed...

31:00.609 --> 31:03.442
...to pass through the gates
into the glory of eternity.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.945
Thank you, Reverend Whitley.
Miss Flanagan, would you like to turn...

31:07.116 --> 31:10.108
-...back to the Vampire Rights Amendment?
-Shut up, shut up.

31:10.286 --> 31:13.449
After the massacre of three of our kind
in Louisiana this week...

31:13.622 --> 31:16.955
...the world should take notice of the fact
that we have not retaliated.

31:17.126 --> 31:20.163
And we will not.
Which leaves us with the question...

31:20.337 --> 31:23.295
...of exactly who is hunting whom
out there in America tonight?

31:23.758 --> 31:27.046
I applaud your rhetoric.
That was very impressive.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.881
-Shut the fuck up!
-But I warn my fellow citizens...

31:30.056 --> 31:32.798
...that her message is false.

31:39.148 --> 31:40.763
Thank you. Thank you. Please, I--

31:40.941 --> 31:43.774
-What is it?
-I need you to move me.

31:43.944 --> 31:47.107
Too much pain.
This chair, it's digging into my skin.

31:47.281 --> 31:51.399
-Thought y'all couldn't feel pain.
-When you don't drink...

31:51.577 --> 31:56.162
...your body-- Your whole body aches more
than anything I ever felt when I was alive.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.822
Please?

31:58.000 --> 32:01.538
-Well, if! move you, will you shut up?
-I promise.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.336
-This better not be a trick.
-It's not.

32:04.507 --> 32:08.841
-And don't you fucking bite me.
-I don't even have the energy. Just, please?

32:11.972 --> 32:13.223
Jesus.

32:13.390 --> 32:17.633
-For a vampire, you sure are a doughy fuck.
-I'm sorry.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.684
There. That any better?

32:22.858 --> 32:25.349
I think so, yeah.

32:25.528 --> 32:29.020
Yeah, good,
because now I'm all fucked-up.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.872
What the hell?

32:49.176 --> 32:52.088
I found an envelope full of cash
in my cubby.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.628
Yeah?

32:53.806 --> 32:56.297
-You know anything about it?
-We'll talk after work.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.057
-Sam, you know I can't--
-I said, after work, all right?

32:59.228 --> 33:01.765
Anyone needs me, I'll be in my office.

33:13.534 --> 33:17.072
Yes, he's done it again.
Another love/y shot.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.580
A hole in one.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.884
Eric. Pam.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.265
Bill, Chow. Chow, Bill.

33:47.443 --> 33:48.774
Nice to meet you.

33:48.944 --> 33:52.061
Chow is Longshadow's replacement.

33:55.451 --> 33:58.818
I take it by your being here,
there was no way around it, then?

33:58.996 --> 34:02.614
I can't really say.
Didn't exactly look into it.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.206
Tell me...

34:05.377 --> 34:08.289
...do you enjoy living halfway up
his backside the way you do?

34:08.464 --> 34:11.456
Yes, it's nice. You should try it.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.635
We're gonna have to stop by the bar
where Sookie works first.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.712
She needs to know that I'll be gone.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.302
Don't forget how this started.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.593
She came to Fangtasia to help you.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.478
Fine. Go to the bar.

34:26.649 --> 34:29.106
Might be smart
to check out the competition.

34:29.276 --> 34:32.643
-Yes, indeed.
-What's your game?

34:32.821 --> 34:34.152
Excuse me?

34:34.323 --> 34:36.655
You were playing Wii. What's your game?

34:36.825 --> 34:38.076
Golf.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.235
What's your best score on Pebble Beach?

34:40.412 --> 34:43.904
-Seven under.
-Mine's 11 under.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.370
I liked Longshadow better.

34:47.920 --> 34:52.334
-It still hurts?
-No, that went right away.

34:52.508 --> 34:54.999
I guess that's a perk of me doing V.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.337
But this--

34:56.512 --> 35:00.175
This stretching just feels
so goddamn fucking good.

35:00.349 --> 35:04.012
-Another perk.
-Yeah.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.851
What's with the weight, dude?

35:06.021 --> 35:08.558
I thought all you vampires
were supposed to be in shape.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.723
We are what we were
when we were turned.

35:10.901 --> 35:13.062
I led a very sedentary life.

35:13.237 --> 35:17.196
-What's sedentary?
-Deskjob. I was an accountant.

35:17.366 --> 35:21.200
Sat around a lot, ate a lot ofjunk food.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.994
Well, how's someone go
from being an accountant...

35:24.164 --> 35:25.620
...to being a vampire?

35:25.791 --> 35:28.123
It wasn't the straightest of lines.

35:29.545 --> 35:31.877
I always had this sense that it wasn't...

35:32.047 --> 35:34.379
...really my life I was leading.

35:34.967 --> 35:38.255
But I convinced myself
it was the life I wanted.

35:38.429 --> 35:41.387
Then one day, about a year ago...

35:41.557 --> 35:44.424
...I came home from work
to find my wife crying...

35:44.852 --> 35:47.218
...like her whole family had just died.

35:47.688 --> 35:51.681
Turns out my son
had had a fistfight at school.

35:51.859 --> 35:56.398
Some of the kids suggested to him
that I might be a "fucking faggot."

35:57.072 --> 35:59.028
Well, kids are morons.

36:00.242 --> 36:04.076
That's precisely the reaction
my wife wanted me to have.

36:04.246 --> 36:06.237
And when I didn't....

36:06.749 --> 36:11.243
-What, she never even had a clue?
-How could she, when even I didn't?

36:13.922 --> 36:16.584
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

36:17.134 --> 36:19.216
Comes a point in life when you realize...

36:19.386 --> 36:22.719
...everything you know about yourself,
it's all just conditioning.

36:24.933 --> 36:29.142
It's the rare man
who truly knows who he is.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.686
At least I accomplished that.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.684
I guess it helps
that you don't look all that gay.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.277
Most of the gays I've come across...

36:42.451 --> 36:44.112
-...they look like--
-You.

36:44.286 --> 36:46.777
You're what we're supposed to look like.

36:49.958 --> 36:53.416
Anyway, after she left me
and took my kid...

36:53.587 --> 36:56.624
...I went to a gay bar,
hit on a couple of men.

36:56.799 --> 37:00.291
Got laughed at. Or pitied.

37:00.469 --> 37:03.051
Then I saw this one guy.

37:05.724 --> 37:10.514
...and he had beautiful young men
all over him.

37:10.896 --> 37:14.855
Somebody told me he was a vampire.
And I guess Ijust thought:

37:15.275 --> 37:17.015
"Well, that's for me."

37:18.487 --> 37:20.648
After that, it was just a matter of time...

37:20.823 --> 37:23.656
...before I found someone
willing to turn me.

37:25.035 --> 37:28.619
-That's crazy.
-I told you it wasn't the straightest of lines.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.492
So...

37:36.672 --> 37:40.631
...how did it work out for you?
With the guys and everything?

37:40.843 --> 37:42.458
Well...

37:44.096 --> 37:45.461
...you tell me.

37:52.229 --> 37:53.514
Okay.

37:53.689 --> 37:56.681
-|'|| have that on the side too.
-Okay, coming right up.

38:00.237 --> 38:02.478
Bill, what's going on?

38:02.656 --> 38:05.648
This place is even more depressing
than I thought it'd be.

38:06.410 --> 38:09.277
-What are they doing here?
-Give me a minute, then we'll talk.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.911
-Where's Sam?
-I don't know. Why?

38:11.081 --> 38:12.742
He's in his office.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.620
-Try to behave yourself.
-Don't I always?

38:21.300 --> 38:24.212
-Yeah?
-Bi|l Compton.

38:24.386 --> 38:27.219
I need a minute of your time,
if that's all right.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.718
It's open.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.056
-Who's this?
-His name's Chow.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.687
-He need to be in my office too?
-Yes.

38:37.858 --> 38:40.520
I have very little time, so I'll be brief.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.272
I've been called away.

38:43.947 --> 38:47.439
And I need you to watch over Sookie,
protect her while I'm gone.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.985
Well, that's just priceless.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.996
Don't expect her to be too keen
on the idea.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.828
Sookie hates feeling
like she doesn't have independence.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.119
I'm really starting to get fed up
with you telling me who Sookie is.

39:00.297 --> 39:01.412
I know.

39:01.757 --> 39:05.716
And I also know how you feel about her,
and I don't like it.

39:05.886 --> 39:09.253
But I'm asking you
because you're the only one I can ask.

39:09.681 --> 39:13.344
You're the only person I know of
who can protect her in my absence.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.521
Will you do it?

39:22.277 --> 39:24.313
Of course I will.

39:24.780 --> 39:27.863
But I'll be doing it for her, not for you.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.113
Thank you.

39:39.127 --> 39:42.619
So simply present this card at the door
when you get to Fangtasia...

39:42.798 --> 39:45.335
...and the first round is on me.

39:45.509 --> 39:48.467
Also, Thursdays are ladies' nights,
so be sure to bring a date.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.298
That is, if you can get one.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.468
She got you.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.550
-Thanks, ma'am.
-Not him.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.272
-He doesn't get one.
-What gives, bro?

40:02.150 --> 40:04.311
What'd you do to your arm there...

40:04.987 --> 40:06.648
...bro?

40:12.828 --> 40:16.662
-I take it your business here is done?
-I came to talk to Sookie.

40:17.666 --> 40:21.079
I'll give you three minutes.
We have a tribunal to get to.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.372
What?

40:23.547 --> 40:24.878
Come with me.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.501
Oh, before I go, a word of advice:

40:31.430 --> 40:35.844
We know when a human has wronged us.
We can smell it.

40:37.352 --> 40:41.516
So do not make the mistake of letting the
pretty blond vampire lady on television...

40:41.690 --> 40:44.181
...make you feel too comfortable.

40:44.526 --> 40:47.233
We may not have retaliated...

40:47.946 --> 40:49.527
...yet...

40:51.033 --> 40:53.194
...but we know who you are.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.619
Have a nice night.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.826
I have no choice, I have to go.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.037
-Why?
-Because I killed a vampire.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.872
I know that, I was there, remember?

41:05.047 --> 41:07.038
He was gonna kill me.
You were defending me.

41:07.883 --> 41:11.796
If one of you killed another one of you
defending one of us, there would be a trial.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.346
-|'|| come with you then.
-No.

41:13.513 --> 41:16.129
I can and I'm going to.
I wanna testify for you.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.139
Damn it, you can't. You can't come.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.392
And you can't testify.

41:20.562 --> 41:22.598
You will not be welcome there.

41:23.190 --> 41:24.771
You lied to me.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.353
You said everything was gonna be okay...

41:27.527 --> 41:29.518
...but it's not, is it?

41:32.574 --> 41:34.485
I honestly don't know.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.197
-Ticktock, Bill.
-Bi||....

41:38.205 --> 41:40.742
Just look after yourself, all right?

41:41.792 --> 41:43.828
I've asked Sam to watch over you.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.288
Wish you hadn't have done that.

41:46.588 --> 41:49.580
Be smart, Sookie, and just let him.

41:49.758 --> 41:52.795
There's still somebody out there
who wants to kill you.

41:54.471 --> 41:57.588
Fine. |Wi||.

41:58.558 --> 42:01.425
-Thank you.
-And time.

42:08.276 --> 42:11.359
lfl had any feelings,
I'd have the chills right about now.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.191
Not me.

42:17.077 --> 42:18.408
Bill.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.494
Now.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.596
You all right?

42:47.983 --> 42:48.972
No.

42:49.151 --> 42:51.312
-Look, I'm sorry about--
-Tara, right now...

42:51.486 --> 42:54.819
...I don't remember what it is
I'm supposed to be mad at you for...

42:54.990 --> 42:59.029
-...so why don't we just forget it, okay?
-Hey, that's good by me.

43:01.288 --> 43:03.700
-It was in the flood.
-A flood?

43:03.874 --> 43:06.490
-Oh, my.
-Yep.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.499
It was the shits.

43:09.171 --> 43:11.662
But you gotta play the hand you're dealt,
Iguess.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.752
And when you say you were
living at your grandmother's...

43:14.926 --> 43:18.043
...I take it to mean your grandfather
was already gone?

43:18.847 --> 43:20.758
I'm so sorry.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.672
Why? It wasn't your fault.

43:22.851 --> 43:27.515
It's just that a boy needs a man in his life
to teach him what it means to be a man.

43:29.357 --> 43:34.147
-Yeah, whatever.
-That's the hardest part of all this for me.

43:34.321 --> 43:35.777
My boy.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.609
He's got nothing but women
around him now.

43:38.784 --> 43:40.991
He needs me. I'm not there.

43:42.746 --> 43:45.533
Well, I'm sure he'll be all right.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.868
I mean, look at me, huh?

43:51.338 --> 43:53.249
Don't you try to glimmer me.

43:53.423 --> 43:55.209
Amy warned me about that.

43:55.383 --> 43:57.374
I'm too depleted to glamour you.

43:59.012 --> 44:01.970
That's something I haven't quite
mastered yet, anyway.

44:02.432 --> 44:04.548
Really? You can't just do it?

44:05.435 --> 44:08.142
Learning to be a vampire
doesn't happen overnight...

44:08.313 --> 44:10.520
...any more than
learning to be a man does.

44:15.070 --> 44:16.981
You gonna marry her?

44:17.864 --> 44:19.195
Who, Amy?

44:19.783 --> 44:21.489
I don't know.

44:22.661 --> 44:25.277
We haven't been together that long.

44:26.748 --> 44:28.204
But...

44:31.169 --> 44:33.501
...just between you and me?

44:34.631 --> 44:37.338
-I could really see her being the one.
-She's not.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.504
-What?
-Don't do it. Don't marry her.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.629
-Hey, fuck you, Eddie.
-She is.

44:44.808 --> 44:47.265
She is far more dangerous
than I could ever be.

44:47.435 --> 44:49.096
That's enough.

44:54.401 --> 44:56.562
Look, I gotta go out
and get some more beer.

44:56.736 --> 45:00.820
But while I'm gone,
keep your fucking howling to a minimum.

45:07.289 --> 45:09.655
Can we talk about it now?

45:10.208 --> 45:11.914
Sure.

45:12.294 --> 45:14.626
That's not talking about it.

45:16.798 --> 45:18.129
I can't take it, Sam.

45:18.300 --> 45:20.632
-I appreciate it, I do. But--
-You're keeping it.

45:20.802 --> 45:23.885
-You can't tell me I'm keeping it.
-It's my money, so, yes, I can.

45:24.055 --> 45:27.718
-You're a stubborn son of a bitch.
-Well, that makes two of us.

45:32.606 --> 45:35.473
You really believe
you have a demon in you?

45:40.322 --> 45:42.904
I think I got something inside me that is...

45:43.074 --> 45:44.814
...scared...

45:45.702 --> 45:47.818
...and pissed off...

45:48.079 --> 45:51.492
-...and mean and fucked-up.
-Fucked-up.

45:53.835 --> 45:56.497
-Think it's stupid, don't you?
-Look, two years ago...

45:56.671 --> 45:59.629
...nobody even knew there was
such a thing as vampires.

45:59.799 --> 46:02.506
Now we gotta deal with them
every goddamn day.

46:03.178 --> 46:05.510
And who knows what else is out there?

46:07.015 --> 46:10.348
Eight hundred bucks?
That's a lot of money, Sam.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.555
Yeah, well....

46:15.190 --> 46:16.851
People in this town drink a lot.

46:18.318 --> 46:20.309
I'm doing okay.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.864
So I guess I'm having an exorcism.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.620
You're welcome.

46:37.879 --> 46:41.371
Oh, Sam.
I don't know how to ever thank--

46:47.138 --> 46:49.094
Interesting night, huh, Sook?

46:49.265 --> 46:52.428
Yeah, I guess.
Maybe a little too interesting.

46:52.602 --> 46:56.845
Shit, ain't no such a thing
as too interesting, only too dull.

46:57.023 --> 46:59.856
So, John, how big is your dick?

47:06.199 --> 47:09.532
You know what?
There is such a thing as too interesting.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.164
-Where's Arlene?
-Oh, she just left.

47:17.335 --> 47:19.496
Of course she did.
I have to get out of here.

47:19.671 --> 47:22.583
Would you mind covering
the rest of my side work for me?

47:22.757 --> 47:26.545
Sure, but is that really the best idea,
you going home by yourself?

47:26.720 --> 47:30.463
I'm not. I'm going to stay at Bill's.
No one'll come looking for me there.

47:30.640 --> 47:34.053
-Okay, then.
-Thanks, I owe you one.

47:36.271 --> 47:38.262
No worries.

48:07.302 --> 48:09.213
-Oh, hey, Amy.
-Hey.

48:09.387 --> 48:10.797
Hey.

48:11.306 --> 48:14.798
Hey, I just wanted to say thanks
for everything you've been doing.

48:14.976 --> 48:17.217
You're fitting in great around here.
Really.

48:17.395 --> 48:21.183
Well, I should be the one thanking you.
Lord knows I needed this job.

48:21.357 --> 48:23.439
But you are welcome.

48:24.110 --> 48:25.611
So where are the others?

48:25.779 --> 48:27.485
Arlene had to get back to her kids...

48:27.655 --> 48:29.907
...and Sookie took off
a couple of minutes ago.

48:30.075 --> 48:31.940
-What?
-Yeah, I tried to stop her, but--

48:32.118 --> 48:34.780
-She say where she was headed?
-She was going to Bill's.

48:34.954 --> 48:36.990
Goddamn it, Sook.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.158
Hey there, Sam.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.745
Turns out that story
you told me the other day...

48:45.924 --> 48:49.212
...about growing up in a nudist colony
didn't exactly check out.

48:49.385 --> 48:50.886
We need to talk.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.385
Sure, just--

48:53.556 --> 48:58.471
You know, I forgot something in the bar,
but I'll be right back. Okay?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.363
Hey,dog.

49:17.497 --> 49:19.203
Well, screw you too.

49:37.517 --> 49:41.476
Oh, my God. Didn't anyone ever tell you
not to sneak up on people like that?

49:42.397 --> 49:44.513
What are you doing
so far away from home?

49:45.942 --> 49:48.149
Why don't you come
spend the night with me...

49:48.319 --> 49:51.482
...and I'll take you
back to Merlotte's tomorrow, okay?

49:59.289 --> 50:00.870
Come on...

50:01.040 --> 50:02.951
...it's night-night time.

50:04.169 --> 50:06.751
Come on. Come on.

50:08.256 --> 50:10.747
You know,
if we're gonna be sleeping together...

50:11.301 --> 50:13.758
...we're gonna need a name
to call you by.

50:13.928 --> 50:15.634
What do you think of "Dean"?

50:16.931 --> 50:20.594
Yeah, I like it too.
Dean. Dean the dog.

50:20.768 --> 50:24.932
Look at you, looking away.
What a gentleman.

50:27.233 --> 50:31.101
Here, would it make you more comfortable
if I got under the covers?

50:40.455 --> 50:41.695
Come on.

50:41.873 --> 50:44.034
Hop up in bed with me.

50:44.459 --> 50:48.077
You can't sleep on the floor all night.
You're gonna catch a draft.

50:48.254 --> 50:50.210
Now, hop up here.

50:54.177 --> 50:56.793
Good boy, Dean.

50:58.973 --> 51:00.838
Sweet dreams.

51:33.049 --> 51:34.664
Eddie?

51:36.344 --> 51:38.551
Eddie, wake up.

51:40.932 --> 51:42.672
Wake up.

51:43.268 --> 51:44.599
Here.

51:44.936 --> 51:47.473
You brought me Tru Blood?

51:49.565 --> 51:51.396
Just drink.

52:01.077 --> 52:03.693
Dean, you're on my feet.

52:04.914 --> 52:06.575
Dean.

52:10.962 --> 52:12.623
Sam?
