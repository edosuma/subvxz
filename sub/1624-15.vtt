I used to come to model parties
here all the time.

10:12.887 --> 10:14.336
And now you clean up
their poop.

10:14.338 --> 10:17.173
You're right.
Life is funny.

10:17.175 --> 10:18.674
Here's the apartment
upstairs tomorrow.

10:18.676 --> 10:21.393
- 10j. Here it is.
- How do I look?

10:21.395 --> 10:23.729
Maybe he's the Abercrombie model
from the Christmas ad

10:23.731 --> 10:24.930
in the white sleigh

10:24.932 --> 10:28.550
with the open fleece jacket
and the eight-pack.

10:28.552 --> 10:30.436
[Sighs]

10:30.438 --> 10:32.488
I don't think it's him.

10:32.490 --> 10:33.439
Hi, I'm big bill.

10:33.441 --> 10:34.607
Come on in, girlies.

10:34.609 --> 10:37.193
How many packs did you say?

10:37.195 --> 10:40.029
Oh, what a lovely... oh!

10:40.031 --> 10:42.748
Oh, my God.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.533
Look, Max, he's a figure skater.

10:44.535 --> 10:46.202
Go ahead, take it all in.

10:46.204 --> 10:47.753
How could you not?

10:47.755 --> 10:49.922
It's okay, I'm a model.
I'm used to it.

10:49.924 --> 10:52.241
Hey, I know you.
You're <i>the</i> big bill.

10:52.243 --> 10:53.843
You're the guy from
the gag greeting cards.

10:53.845 --> 10:56.428
Yep. I sold 2 million
of that particular card.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.763
On the front it says,
"you're on,"

10:57.765 --> 10:59.014
when you open it up...

10:59.016 --> 11:00.466
- Both: "Thin ice"!
- Right.

11:00.468 --> 11:02.852
Oh, I've got to go
in my bedroom and change.

11:02.854 --> 11:05.271
I'll be right back.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.388
Wow, big bill!

11:06.390 --> 11:07.907
No, big bye-bye.

11:07.909 --> 11:09.191
We're not staying here.

11:09.193 --> 11:10.192
If that's what's on the wall,

11:10.194 --> 11:11.426
who knows what's on the floor.

11:11.428 --> 11:13.229
Or trapped underneath it.

11:13.231 --> 11:14.897
This is an uncomfortable
work environment.

11:14.899 --> 11:17.700
You were going to be on
all fours scrubbing a toilet.

11:17.702 --> 11:20.936
It was always going to be an
uncomfortable work environment.

11:20.938 --> 11:22.454
Okay, if we're staying,
that's three times

11:22.456 --> 11:25.040
the amount of man.
We should get double the money.

11:25.042 --> 11:26.158
I'm calling Sophie right now

11:26.160 --> 11:27.459
and telling her
we should get more.

11:27.461 --> 11:29.444
Um, I would not suggest
you complain to Sophie.

11:29.446 --> 11:30.496
It's not a good idea.

11:30.498 --> 11:32.631
Why? Do you know
something I don't?

11:32.633 --> 11:34.283
She thinks you don't
know how to clean,

11:34.285 --> 11:36.385
that you spritz, spritz.

11:36.387 --> 11:38.387
And what does she say
about your cleaning skills?

11:38.389 --> 11:40.422
I'm a bull and I roar.

11:40.424 --> 11:41.974
I knew she didn't like me.

11:41.976 --> 11:44.093
She only has eye for you.

11:44.095 --> 11:46.562
Who cares what she thinks.
Just clean better today.

11:46.564 --> 11:48.564
You do the living room.
I'll do the bathroom.

11:48.566 --> 11:50.983
No, I'll do the bathroom,
just to prove a point.

11:50.985 --> 11:52.518
I mean, reprove it.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.519
This is just like when

11:53.521 --> 11:55.104
they made me take
the S.A.T.S again,

11:55.106 --> 11:59.775
away from all the asian kids.

11:59.777 --> 12:02.244
Oh! Oh, my God!

12:03.863 --> 12:05.080
Why are you freaking out?

12:05.082 --> 12:06.448
You've already seen him naked.

12:06.450 --> 12:07.482
It's not him.

12:07.484 --> 12:10.194
Have you seen the size
of this toilet?

12:12.990 --> 12:16.458
That is a big-ass toilet.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.295
Literally.

12:25.001 --> 12:26.552
Max, I'm finished.

12:26.554 --> 12:28.387
The floor is so clean
you could eat off it,

12:28.389 --> 12:30.122
and I'm sure he will.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.608
Come on in,
I want you to see it.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.109
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:34.111 --> 12:36.562
Go down, go down, stop.
Never mind!

12:36.564 --> 12:39.398
Don't need you to see it.
Everything's okay.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.700
How's it going out there?

12:41.702 --> 12:45.020
Either your water just broke,
or you pee like a smurf.

12:45.022 --> 12:46.288
My shoes.

12:46.290 --> 12:49.908
No, you did not flush
a whole roll of paper towels.

12:49.910 --> 12:52.027
No, you did not
just use that tone with me

12:52.029 --> 12:53.245
when my good shoes are wet.

12:53.247 --> 12:54.246
Shut off the valve.

12:54.248 --> 12:55.297
The valve?

12:55.299 --> 12:57.583
Oh, God,
what is wrong with you?

12:57.585 --> 13:00.085
How can you not know where
a toilet valve is?

13:00.087 --> 13:01.337
I was rich.

13:01.339 --> 13:02.888
But you have to admit,
the mirror?

13:02.890 --> 13:06.225
Nailed it.

13:14.851 --> 13:16.885
Wake up, you lazy bitch!

13:16.887 --> 13:18.070
- What?
- Fire!

13:18.072 --> 13:20.322
I'm fired?
Why, because of the toilet?

13:20.324 --> 13:22.408
Look at the oven,
the cupcakes.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.777
I'm sorry.
I fell asleep.

13:24.779 --> 13:26.829
I was just going to lay down
for five minutes.

13:26.831 --> 13:28.530
I asked you to do
one thing

13:28.532 --> 13:30.199
while I went out
to get more milk...

13:30.201 --> 13:33.035
Take the cupcakes
out of the oven.

13:33.037 --> 13:36.038
"Happy Birthday, kids.
From Max's homemade cupcakes.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.791
"You can learn more about us
and our blackened cupcakes

13:38.793 --> 13:41.076
on our expensive website."

13:41.078 --> 13:42.428
I'm sorry, Max.

13:42.430 --> 13:45.214
I just really needed a little
siesta after all that cleaning.

13:45.216 --> 13:48.767
How are you so good at Spanish
and so bad at cleaning?

13:48.769 --> 13:51.920
What is that smell?

13:51.922 --> 13:53.722
I grabbed my purse and ran.

13:53.724 --> 13:55.774
Caroline burned cupcakes.

13:55.776 --> 13:58.310
Oh, so sad.

13:58.312 --> 14:01.263
Look at all those burnt cakes.

14:01.265 --> 14:02.815
What happened here?

14:02.817 --> 14:04.116
Just a little mishap.

14:04.118 --> 14:06.452
I was so tired from cleaning
that bathroom earlier,

14:06.454 --> 14:08.103
that I laid my head down
for five minutes

14:08.105 --> 14:10.939
- and ended up falling asleep.
- Aw...

14:10.941 --> 14:12.925
Such a shame.

14:12.927 --> 14:16.462
Oh, look Max.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.081
These cupcakes,
they're hard as rocks.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.632
All you have to do

14:20.634 --> 14:24.480
is throw the rock away,
and whee!

14:34.170 --> 14:36.070
I don't think Sophie likes me.

14:36.072 --> 14:37.789
What are you talking about?
She loves you.

14:37.791 --> 14:39.758
No. I don't think
she has a blind spot.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.694
I think she has
a blonde spot... for me.

14:46.349 --> 14:47.799
Well, I think we've
found the place

14:47.801 --> 14:51.386
where red bulls come to die.

14:51.388 --> 14:54.589
Man, why do I never get
invited to parties like this?

14:54.591 --> 14:56.758
Look. Do you know
what that means?

14:56.760 --> 14:58.977
Yeah, this building
has a real shirt shortage.

14:58.979 --> 15:00.612
Oh, my God,
do you think

15:00.614 --> 15:02.280
this might be the Abercrombie
model's apartment?

15:02.282 --> 15:05.099
I doubt it's the Abercrombie
model's apartment.

15:05.101 --> 15:06.118
Here's a note.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.486
It's addressed
to "cleaning dood,"

15:07.488 --> 15:09.771
"dude" spelled "d-o-o-d."

15:09.773 --> 15:13.241
It definitely might be the
Abercrombie model's apartment.

15:13.243 --> 15:15.710
"Wake me when you get here."
He wants us to wake him.

15:15.712 --> 15:18.163
So, do you think
he sleeps in the nude?

15:18.165 --> 15:20.832
Yeah, "nood", "n-o-o-d."

15:20.834 --> 15:22.584
Come on, let's go look.

15:22.586 --> 15:24.619
Oh, oh, oh, so what,
seeing this guy naked

15:24.621 --> 15:27.121
is no longer an "uncomfortable
work environment"?

15:27.123 --> 15:28.140
It's still uncomfortable,

15:28.142 --> 15:30.509
but in that exciting
uncomfortable way.

15:34.096 --> 15:35.597
[Whispering]
I think it is him.

15:35.599 --> 15:37.899
It's the guy who put
the "abs" in Abercrombie.

15:37.901 --> 15:40.602
And he's naked.
The good naked.

15:40.604 --> 15:41.987
Should we lift the sheet?

15:41.989 --> 15:44.272
Why not? I already
lifted it in my mind.

15:44.274 --> 15:45.357
Max, I got this.

15:45.359 --> 15:48.476
You start cleaning up
the mess out there.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.829
No, you start cleaning
the mess out there... I got this.

15:50.831 --> 15:52.164
The bedroom's attached
to the bathroom,

15:52.166 --> 15:54.816
and I always do the bathrooms,
and he's my ideal type.

15:54.818 --> 15:56.818
And by "doing" the bathrooms
do you mean flooding them,

15:56.820 --> 15:58.486
and by "ideal type,"
do you mean unconscious?

15:58.488 --> 16:00.321
Shh! We can talk
about this out here.

16:00.323 --> 16:01.790
You're going to wake him.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.108
That's what we're
supposed to do.

16:03.110 --> 16:07.262
But as usual,
you don't want to do the job.

16:07.264 --> 16:10.048
What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

16:10.050 --> 16:11.516
Well, why should I have
to do all the heavy lifting

16:11.518 --> 16:14.302
while you just get to nap
and see free model penis?

16:14.304 --> 16:16.521
All the heavy lifting?
Where'd you get that from?

16:16.523 --> 16:17.689
No one.

16:17.691 --> 16:18.690
Sophie.

16:18.692 --> 16:20.725
I knew she didn't like me.

16:20.727 --> 16:22.110
It's not that
she doesn't like you,

16:22.112 --> 16:23.028
she just doesn't think you're...

16:23.030 --> 16:24.529
What? Doing anything?

16:24.531 --> 16:25.847
She thinks
I'm not pulling my weight?

16:25.849 --> 16:26.865
She thinks I'm dead weight?

16:26.867 --> 16:30.318
Not dead weight,
more like... a rock...

16:30.320 --> 16:32.287
To my balloon.

16:32.289 --> 16:35.657
What is that,
some kind of Polish haiku?

16:35.659 --> 16:37.125
What does that even mean?

16:37.127 --> 16:42.030
She thinks if I cut the rock
loose, I'll go... fuuuuu!

16:42.032 --> 16:43.548
Wait, so you're siding with

16:43.550 --> 16:45.366
a woman you met
a week ago over me?

16:45.368 --> 16:47.502
I'm not siding with anyone.
I'm just saying...

16:47.504 --> 16:50.138
I know what this is.
This is "pick on the rich girl."

16:50.140 --> 16:52.257
It's a poverty smackdown.

16:52.259 --> 16:54.476
I heard you two talking
while I was in her bathroom,

16:54.478 --> 16:56.795
spritz spritzing.

16:56.797 --> 16:59.264
You think you do everything?
Fine, do everything.

16:59.266 --> 17:01.516
You can "balloon"
all over this place,

17:01.518 --> 17:04.986
'cause the "rock" is leaving.

17:07.323 --> 17:08.240
[Knocking at door]

17:08.242 --> 17:11.224
[Sarcastically]
Who is it?

17:11.227 --> 17:13.612
You're the rock!
I'm the balloon!

17:13.614 --> 17:16.064
Without me lifting you out of
your negative rockness,

17:16.066 --> 17:17.699
you wouldn't even have
a cupcake business.

17:17.701 --> 17:19.733
I'm the reason we even
have cupcake jobs.

17:19.736 --> 17:20.919
Oh, oh, you're the reason?

17:20.921 --> 17:23.788
Who stayed up all last night
baking 24 more cupcakes

17:23.790 --> 17:25.089
while you were sleeping?

17:25.092 --> 17:27.626
You did. And who delivered
the cupcakes this morning

17:27.627 --> 17:30.762
while you were sleeping?
I did. Me. The balloon.

17:30.764 --> 17:33.848
I floated over there and got
paid for the job that I got us

17:33.850 --> 17:36.134
from the website
that I'm trying to pay for.

17:36.136 --> 17:37.585
And now, I'm going
to float down this hall

17:37.587 --> 17:40.522
and wake the hot model up
'cause, contrary to what you

17:40.524 --> 17:42.256
and your poverty gal-pal
might think,

17:42.258 --> 17:43.892
I always do the job
I'm hired for.

17:43.894 --> 17:45.810
Oh, no! I am going
to wake him up.

17:45.812 --> 17:48.480
Free model penis is my reward
for doing everything

17:48.482 --> 17:51.733
and being tied
to a rock like you.

17:51.735 --> 17:53.351
Oh, see? I can't get away,
because you're the rock

17:53.353 --> 17:56.855
and you're heavier
than my balloon.

17:56.857 --> 17:59.824
Hey, stop!

17:59.826 --> 18:01.493
This is cleaning job,

18:01.495 --> 18:05.030
not gorgeous ladies
of wrestling.

18:05.032 --> 18:06.447
Good thing I stopped by
to check on you.

18:06.449 --> 18:08.783
- What is all this?
- You explain it.

18:08.785 --> 18:10.635
I'm going
to go wake the hot model up.

18:10.637 --> 18:12.754
He left a note.
Just doing my job.

18:12.756 --> 18:14.055
As usual.

18:18.094 --> 18:20.312
So, you think
I'm holding Max back?

18:20.314 --> 18:22.314
What kind of question is this?

18:22.316 --> 18:24.182
Yes.

18:24.184 --> 18:27.135
Well, you're wrong.
We're a great team.

18:27.137 --> 18:28.853
And, yes, there are some
things she's better at.

18:28.855 --> 18:31.139
But there are other areas
where I excel.

18:31.141 --> 18:33.274
Well, I don't see them.

18:33.276 --> 18:35.356
That's probably
because of your eye.

18:37.947 --> 18:39.147
Did you wake him up?

18:39.149 --> 18:42.017
Uh, no.
I think he might be dead.

18:46.922 --> 18:49.541
Oh, no, not the hot one!

18:49.543 --> 18:51.676
Aw, he's my favorite.

18:51.678 --> 18:53.494
This is all I need on yelp.

18:53.496 --> 18:55.880
We should call 911.

18:55.882 --> 18:57.349
No, I got it.

18:57.351 --> 18:59.968
What are you going to do?

18:59.970 --> 19:02.187
I'm going to give him
mouth-to-mouth.

19:11.013 --> 19:15.283
I didn't know there was
so much tongue involved.

19:15.285 --> 19:17.351
This is not working.

19:17.353 --> 19:19.187
But, you know what?
I know he's still alive,

19:19.189 --> 19:23.625
because his manhood
is knocking on my lady door.

19:32.329 --> 19:34.953
He must have taken too many
of those pills on the table.

19:34.955 --> 19:36.504
Pills? I got this.

19:36.506 --> 19:38.206
Max, go get some
hydrogen peroxide.

19:38.251 --> 19:41.509
- Sophie, step aside, now.
- Oh, all right.

19:41.511 --> 19:42.877
You sure you know
what you're doing?

19:42.879 --> 19:45.046
My friend Candace travelstead
od'd like three times

19:45.048 --> 19:49.250
in college,
and I brought her back twice.

19:49.252 --> 19:50.351
There you go.

19:50.353 --> 19:51.936
Bring him up.

19:51.938 --> 19:56.024
Max, you hold his head back,
open his mouth.

20:00.262 --> 20:01.595
Back up.

20:01.597 --> 20:04.148
[Grunting, hitting]

20:04.150 --> 20:07.198
[Vomiting]

20:09.371 --> 20:12.161
I'm starting
to see your worth.

20:17.713 --> 20:20.832
What? You're being
subway creepy.

20:20.834 --> 20:22.583
I have to say,
when you were punching

20:22.585 --> 20:24.085
that almost-dead guy
in the stomach,

20:24.087 --> 20:26.254
that was a serious
balloon move.

20:26.256 --> 20:28.389
The truth is,
we're both balloons.

20:28.391 --> 20:31.959
Yeah, but mine is, like,
way cooler than yours.

20:31.961 --> 20:34.312
It's like one of those silver
ones that never goes out of air.

20:34.314 --> 20:36.130
They don't make those anymore.
They're toxic.

20:36.255 --> 20:38.599
Exactly.

20:38.601 --> 20:41.319
Max, you know you won't
let me come into the kitchen

20:41.321 --> 20:42.803
and help you bake, right?

20:42.805 --> 20:44.739
And you know that
I know that without you,

20:44.741 --> 20:47.492
the job fairy
would never show up, right?

20:47.494 --> 20:50.161
But if you ever need me
to help you bake, I could.

20:50.163 --> 20:51.145
No, it's cool.

20:51.147 --> 20:52.830
You do your thing,
I'll do mine.

20:52.832 --> 20:54.032
Hey, get your phone.

20:54.034 --> 20:55.950
We should capture this
near-death victory moment

20:55.952 --> 20:57.168
as our website picture.

20:57.170 --> 20:58.419
Totally.

20:58.421 --> 21:02.367
On the count of three,
think..."We made $200."

21:03.510 --> 21:04.709
One... two...

21:04.711 --> 21:06.127
Hold up.

21:06.129 --> 21:07.929
Sir, if you want to go home
with that hand,

21:07.931 --> 21:10.331
get it off my ass.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.366
Okay, three.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.474
[Ca-ching]
