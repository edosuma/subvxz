01:27.337 --> 01:30.924
Everything has its own story

01:32.009 --> 01:33.969
Of yore

01:34.261 --> 01:36.638
This map is part of the Chinese-controlled territory

01:36.805 --> 01:38.849
By an emperor who is good

01:39.433 --> 01:43.395
One day a stranger invading his country

01:44.855 --> 01:48.525
For months the emperor to fight

01:48.984 --> 01:51.778
But frustration with the difference in strength with the enemy forces

01:52.321 --> 01:54.323
Countries in crisis

01:55.490 --> 01:59.077
Suddenly the dragon fell from the sky

02:00.621 --> 02:02.122
This gave the Emperor

02:02.289 --> 02:05.208
A power to own property

02:05.417 --> 02:06.752
Pearl

02:06.918 --> 02:08.586
Pearl Dragon

02:08.753 --> 02:11.381
Emperor's troops remaining 300 soldiers

02:11.548 --> 02:14.676
Changed to 30 million soldiers

02:16.762 --> 02:19.348
Emperor won the war

02:20.182 --> 02:24.811
But Pearl Dragon has been lost in the war

02:25.270 --> 02:30.400
Pearls can not be returned, the emperor felt guilty Liver

02:32.277 --> 02:35.864
Eventually he fell ill

02:39.159 --> 02:42.829
Jiabeng the Pearl Dragon were assigned to find the missing

02:43.288 --> 02:47.250
To return to the origins

04:07.122 --> 04:08.290
Hey, Hey

04:16.298 --> 04:18.382

Take the items you

Mothers should bring a child's friend anymore

07:07.802 --> 07:08.887
Josh

07:09.638 --> 07:10.639
Hey

07:10.805 --> 07:12.849
I am your father's colleague, Dr. Lee

07:13.016 --> 07:14.017
Oh Hi

07:14.184 --> 07:15.560
This is my daughter, Lingling

07:15.894 --> 07:17.979
So, my dad did not come?

07:18.146 --> 07:20.231
Um, I apologize on his behalf

07:21.983 --> 07:23.276

07:23.443 --> 07:25.570
Here, I help you take a suitcase

07:29.199 --> 07:31.284
Well Dad, I know

07:39.125 --> 07:43.964
Well, After a few more weeks just met.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.095
Still this music

07:50.303 --> 07:51.721
What music

07:52.389 --> 07:55.600
Flute sound, which comes from ntah

08:05.819 --> 08:07.487
Two masked men came to steal the goods

08:07.946 --> 08:09.656
So the current situation is like this

08:09.906 --> 08:10.907
If I was a little late

08:11.074 --> 08:12.742
You've hurt worse.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.619
Thieves certainly could not escape.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.337
Your son comes

08:24.504 --> 08:25.463
Josh

08:25.630 --> 08:26.548

08:43.982 --> 08:46.609
I've heard

08:46.776 --> 08:49.779
Last night your father wants to catch a thief

08:49.946 --> 08:53.491
No big deal, long story

08:54.784 --> 08:55.744
Your mother is fine?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.245
You do not just ask him?

08:58.288 --> 09:00.206
In fact, we are talking

09:00.707 --> 09:02.625
The journey you are fluent?

09:02.834 --> 09:03.835
Still permitted.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.170

They want to talk to you

09:09.841 --> 09:12.385
Phillips, This is my son Josh

09:12.719 --> 09:14.888
Phillips is a master of Geology

09:15.055 --> 09:16.055
Hi, Nice to meet you.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.223
Hey Josh, Nice to meet you.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.433
You are the boss here?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.935
I also think, ah Dr. Lee is the boss

09:21.102 --> 09:22.687
I just subordinates.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.273
I am very happy to see you

09:25.690 --> 09:28.443
Thieves steal anything? What there is treasure here?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.612
Treasure, of course there is.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.822
Please do not tell other people first.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.450
- Nice to meet you
- I am very pleased

09:35.617 --> 09:36.618
- Bye
- Bye

09:36.826 --> 09:38.995
Sorry Josh, I have no business here.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.456
The driver will take you back, we meet again at dinner

09:41.623 --> 09:43.792
Rest a minute, we'll talk again

09:43.958 --> 09:44.918
Both father

Glad you could come

10:03.812 --> 10:04.979
Please come in

10:11.903 --> 10:13.029
Okay, bye-bye

10:13.196 --> 10:14.197
Bye-bye

11:19.804 --> 11:20.805
Josh

11:41.284 --> 11:42.285
Sorry, Sorry

11:42.952 --> 11:44.329
Do have any identification?

11:44.621 --> 11:47.081
You must use this card. This is a sign of her identification.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.291
Okay

11:49.459 --> 11:51.294
You think I look like a thief grave?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.338
Not me, but they are.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.632
Philip, I do not understand

11:55.798 --> 11:57.508
Why now discuss this issue

11:57.675 --> 11:59.385
What day is today?

12:00.011 --> 12:02.847
Please Chris, let's take a look at this

12:04.474 --> 12:07.101
I want to confirm the facts, may I?

12:07.435 --> 12:10.480
Tomb of Emperor Zhang, Image sonar

12:10.688 --> 12:12.482
Guess what, we Verification

12:12.649 --> 12:15.151
The tomb does have a lot of space inside

12:15.610 --> 12:16.945
These results are accurate?

12:18.029 --> 12:19.155
Ground water level rise?

12:19.614 --> 12:20.865
Dr. Lee, not only increasing

12:21.407 --> 12:22.575
But it is very acidic

12:22.784 --> 12:24.327
Josh, Do not just touch

12:24.494 --> 12:25.662
I think this is no doubt

12:25.828 --> 12:28.247
Water will corrode the tomb of everything

12:28.748 --> 12:30.833
If it failed to lift the pressure today

12:31.417 --> 12:33.002
I think we should hire a group of experts

12:33.211 --> 12:35.797
To blow up the door

12:36.464 --> 12:38.007
Come on this is too silly

12:38.174 --> 12:40.385
Every part of the tomb was priceless

12:40.677 --> 12:41.719
Of course, Chris

12:41.886 --> 12:43.638
But we do not have time

12:43.805 --> 12:44.889
Things that are priorities

12:45.139 --> 12:46.891
Protect the inside is the most important

12:47.141 --> 12:49.102
But it can not damage the precious relics

12:49.269 --> 12:50.144
Listen to me

12:50.311 --> 12:51.521
I understand what you mean

12:51.688 --> 12:53.147
But Chris is right

12:53.815 --> 12:56.067
There is no better way

12:56.234 --> 12:58.569
Contact an expert as soon as I opened the entrance to the tomb

12:58.736 --> 12:59.696
Okay

13:00.446 --> 13:01.864
I have put people

13:02.031 --> 13:02.949
mmm.

13:03.116 --> 13:03.658

148th

- You should not dig here!
- Hey bole ga in! ga allowed to enter!

13:09.706 --> 13:12.875
What's the matter? Every day you come.

Why?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.129
- What are you looking for?
- He allows us to explore here

13:16.671 --> 13:17.672
He was a strange

13:17.839 --> 13:20.758
- You do not go, we called the police
- No, no. No go, no go.

13:20.925 --> 13:21.843
Drag out

13:22.302 --> 13:23.928

13:24.095 --> 13:25.555
Going fast! Going fast!

13:25.722 --> 13:28.808
Oh, you can it?

13:29.434 --> 13:30.935
Pretty simple

13:31.311 --> 13:34.272
Simple? It seems that an expert

13:36.774 --> 13:37.817
Robbers! robbers! robbers!

13:37.984 --> 13:40.570
Hey boy how?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.864

14:08.014 --> 14:09.140
Hey, you going?

14:09.307 --> 14:10.433
To restore this

14:11.100 --> 14:12.643
How do you know it got him?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.187
I know

14:16.522 --> 14:18.066
Do you think he is a grave robber?

14:18.232 --> 14:19.525
Thieves will not bring the flute

14:20.318 --> 14:21.527
You really really sure?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.279
In time you will know

14:34.832 --> 14:36.459
Slowly open, do not rush

14:36.626 --> 14:37.794
- Be careful
- Here

14:37.960 --> 14:39.337
If it can be chaotic until broken

14:39.754 --> 14:41.964
We ensure that only allowed hammering 5cm/menit

14:42.173 --> 14:43.424
The final decision then.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.511
Well yes I crane calibration

14:46.677 --> 14:49.013

14:49.180 --> 14:51.057

14:51.599 --> 14:53.893
I really hope Josh is here now

14:54.060 --> 14:55.937
Yes, Ling-Ling also must be very excited

15:11.536 --> 15:12.537

Oh, sorry

Bigger than I imagined

16:16.767 --> 16:17.768
Let's go

16:34.994 --> 16:36.704
You follow me so?

16:37.955 --> 16:39.123
Nga ah.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.877
Ah yes, but I

16:43.085 --> 16:45.129
Children should not lie

16:45.505 --> 16:47.465
And there again, you do this

16:47.632 --> 16:49.800
Very, very, very insolent.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.970
I just want to restore this

16:53.137 --> 16:54.305
Restore what?

16:59.435 --> 17:00.603
Well, uda satisfied yet?

17:01.312 --> 17:02.563
Task completed. Come back

Australians. He was very rude

17:12.448 --> 17:14.909
Thank you, thank you.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.703
Flute is very important.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.080
If lost I would end up.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.709
Surely die. My family is also ...

17:23.917 --> 17:25.545
Really good at bluffing. Let's go.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.628
I do not go

17:26.796 --> 17:29.173
I can always hear your flute properly.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.009
Mmmhh ...

17:34.679 --> 17:36.555
Well more and more embarrassing.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.725
You do not rush, I'll deal with it.

17:40.476 --> 17:46.190
Only one person in the whole world can hear this flute.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.821
Well back a bit distiller.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.866
You can actually hear the sound of this flute?

17:56.993 --> 17:57.994
Yes.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.454
Okay.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.809
Yes, this song.

18:26.772 --> 18:27.982
Again.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.830
Is it?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.290
Not.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.465
Is this?
226th
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,133
Not.
227th
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,217
Well.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.313
This song.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.900
Oh Buddha ...

19:12.610 --> 19:16.155
What song? No sound?

19:16.322 --> 19:19.075
How could it not audible? Did not you hear it.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.745
You do not hear, I also do not hear it.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.581
But you can?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.336
Not possible

19:31.712 --> 19:33.130
Unless ..

19:37.468 --> 19:41.055
In addition to the Dragon and the successor to the Kingdom

19:42.973 --> 19:43.974

Oh, sorry.

I've found it.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.133
Welcome to the Temple of the Dragon!

20:17.383 --> 20:19.176
My name is Wu Dong

20:19.343 --> 20:24.014
I and my ancestors have protected the Temple of the Dragon more than three thousand years.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.891
As my flute

20:26.225 --> 20:28.686
Three thousand years, a total of six thousand years.

Oh long, very long is not it?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.733
Uh, Do not touch, do not touch, should not be in touch

See here.

21:13.731 --> 21:14.732
Oh, wow

21:16.108 --> 21:17.109
Oh.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.153
Finally found.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.363

21:21.530 --> 21:23.574
- So beautiful.
- Is ah

21:25.284 --> 21:26.285
Come!

21:26.994 --> 21:29.455
- Hey yeah
- Yeah

21:30.039 --> 21:31.332
Very great.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.001
The air was pretty good.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.378
- Well
- This is great. Very nice.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.006
- Take some photos again
- Very nice. Very nice.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.841
Catch this.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.385
Good catch, yes, one, two

21:43.552 --> 21:45.638
Also the third, good catch!

21:45.888 --> 21:47.556
Have you seen yet? here

21:49.308 --> 21:57.399
Successor kingdom is the Son of
Children, children, kids emperor.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.736
Lest the question is are you?

22:01.070 --> 22:03.781
Only the royal succession could open the door.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.032
Which door?

22:05.282 --> 22:09.620
Which door? Eastern Door

22:11.497 --> 22:13.749
The door on the ground.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.585
The door on the ground.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.838
He's talking nonsense.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.260
We have .....

22:26.053 --> 22:30.724
Only through a new magic triangle can find the door.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.770
Magical Triangle, Triangle Magic

22:36.730 --> 22:39.358
Too messy, too messy, clean for a while.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.402
Messy, chaotic.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.279
Clean the moment, with what?

22:45.406 --> 22:48.117
Sweep briefly sapa tau could meet.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.497
Too messy certainly can not be found.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.087
Stop, Do not sweep again.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.380
Why?

23:01.547 --> 23:02.715
Are you looking for a triangle?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.009
See here.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.677
Here's the pattern.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.178
To view the design is very compact.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.515
Ash fell on the vertices of a triangle.

23:13.267 --> 23:16.937
There, there and here.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.107
- Maybe.
- It's definitely a mystical triangle.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.318
Eastern knot is

23:22.484 --> 23:24.153
The key to open the door

23:25.112 --> 23:26.113
East

23:26.614 --> 23:29.533
East, Eastern Knot here.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.745
Do, Do, Do, Do not move

23:32.911 --> 23:34.788
Successor to the Kingdom you try, you try.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.957
Give it to me.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.792
We try to ga useful.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.638
Ga correct.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.309
Ga correct.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.752
What the book says it is true.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.965
I do not believe life can still be seen.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.717
I really do not believe it.

24:28.968 --> 24:34.306
It has been three thousand years.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.600
Owh, I am Buddhist.

24:36.767 --> 24:37.685
Siau Ling!

24:37.851 --> 24:39.603
Really bad

24:39.770 --> 24:41.188
Wu Dung quickly think of a way.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.608
- Of course, the idea, looking for ideas.
- Quick

24:44.942 --> 24:48.237
Find ideas, how, how ...

24:48.654 --> 24:50.990
Yeah, I thought ..

24:52.574 --> 24:54.034
- Just this
- Just this

24:54.284 --> 24:57.287
Siau Ling, I left.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.580
Wait!
323rd
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,585
Siau Ling, you okay?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.379
I'm still good.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.505
You okay?

25:06.672 --> 25:08.841
Okay, go and check what is written in the book next.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.260
Good good

25:11.760 --> 25:14.346
Ah be careful. I go, I go check.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.597
Look for what to do.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.599
How, still want to come in kedalamkah?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.644
Sampe already here.

26:12.196 --> 26:15.365
There are many men? There are many men?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.412
Wow, must have a rope to descend down.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.126
What is it?

26:26.376 --> 26:27.419
What!

26:28.670 --> 26:31.465
That is ... I do not know.

26:35.719 --> 26:36.720
What's the matter?

26:39.056 --> 26:42.100
That is. What I see is ..

26:42.810 --> 26:44.853
Well look like you've scared me, what is it exactly?

26:45.020 --> 26:46.563
- Ah

26:48.607 --> 26:49.983
What's the matter?

26:55.114 --> 26:58.867
Siau Ling, Ling Siau, Siau Ling

26:59.785 --> 27:02.204
Like the saber-toothed tiger or a big dinosaur.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.832
I do not know, just it is a big monster.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.041
Josh you calm down first.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.709
Under it there is a big giant.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.169
If he does come out, then he will eat people.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.213
- Josh
- We need a tranquilizer gun.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.590
He awoke to see

27:13.757 --> 27:15.092
This situation is not too bad

27:16.343 --> 27:18.220
Siau Ling, tell them.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.599
Sorry, I need to check it out.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.767
Okay okay

27:24.017 --> 27:26.353
Josh we need to let the doctor to examine.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.646
Well, Josh

27:30.566 --> 27:32.484
Then I go I go

27:32.776 --> 27:33.902
I went to make tea for everyone

27:34.069 --> 27:35.988
Does no one care about the giants?

27:36.446 --> 27:39.992
You do not need to tell me now, later we will discuss

27:40.868 --> 27:41.869
Hear.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.580
You should tell them the truth.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.748
And what we saw.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.461
The thing about the hole.

27:53.630 --> 27:57.718
Me, I do not remember.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.262
Monster, do not remember how?

28:03.348 --> 28:07.978
Sorry, I forgot how.

28:10.939 --> 28:11.982
Josh.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.409
Rest well dear.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.705
I actually saw it.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.081
Josh

28:28.582 --> 28:30.626
It sounds really ..

28:30.876 --> 28:32.377
A little crazy.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.964
Crazy?

28:37.007 --> 28:38.592
What is called crazy? Are you and my mother divorced?

28:39.509 --> 28:40.844
Eh, .. okay.

28:42.888 --> 28:43.889
Okay.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.558
I do not know how to explain this to you.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.894
- Your mother and I
- It's come to that.

28:49.353 --> 28:52.314
- Do not explain.
- No, no, I have to explain my son.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.067
- Listen to me
- How can you not listen to me

28:56.068 --> 29:00.697
Hey Chris, disturbing

29:01.156 --> 29:05.160
No, Philip all fine

29:05.327 --> 29:07.496
Well if you do not mind

29:07.996 --> 29:10.415
I want to hear Josh say about

29:10.624 --> 29:11.833
Giant

29:14.169 --> 29:16.922
Well, I also want to hear, both listening

29:17.422 --> 29:20.968
You say from the beginning of what you see.

29:27.182 --> 29:30.018
Follow me, We're almost there. Hurry!

29:30.227 --> 29:31.353
Wu Dong will tell you

29:31.770 --> 29:32.980
Follow.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.481
Okay.

29:36.858 --> 29:40.404
Oh scene here is pretty good too.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.708
Wu Dong, you there?

29:55.711 --> 29:57.087
Wu Dong

29:59.172 --> 30:01.300
There was a he named Wu Dong.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.844
He has kept for 3000 years here.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.472
Not only he but also his ancestors.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.099
Wu Dong

30:11.143 --> 30:14.438
- Hello, there are many men?
- Today finished up here?

30:16.648 --> 30:20.027
Hey, where the incense, the incense?

30:20.318 --> 30:21.570
Yesterday is still here

30:22.654 --> 30:24.823
Anyway, there are some incense, incense in several positions.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.575
You see, the ash will fall on a predetermined location.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.868
Will show the secret door.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.911
Lock the door there.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.455
Siau Lin with strange worship

30:31.705 --> 30:32.873
He's like this

30:33.457 --> 30:35.500
With her head lying on the ground here

30:35.709 --> 30:37.461
Tap here and then

30:38.128 --> 30:40.130
Here is an amazing secret door

30:40.380 --> 30:44.843
Able to open the secret door and closed back

30:45.510 --> 30:47.804
But I can not open, just Siau Ling who can do it

30:48.013 --> 30:49.514
But I do not believe the lies

30:49.681 --> 30:51.933
All that can be opened he would be able to open others as well.

31:01.526 --> 31:05.197
Lies within.

31:06.323 --> 31:09.117
Josh why do not we go back on the other days.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.745
And try again with Ling-Ling.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.833
And I'm still curious.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.252
It seems easy to open

31:20.295 --> 31:21.755
Dad, It's Wu Dong

31:21.922 --> 31:23.048
Come, I want to introduce.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.094
Hey, Wu Dong.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.303
Tell my father there is a monster

31:28.762 --> 31:29.763
How are you?

31:29.930 --> 31:30.889
How are you?

31:31.515 --> 31:33.683
You live in the holy temple?

31:36.478 --> 31:38.271
Eh, .. What I have lived in the temple?

31:38.688 --> 31:40.565
Sorry I do not understand what you're talking about.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.359
I go to work first.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.694
No, not Wu Dong You should not go.

31:44.861 --> 31:45.904
Quick talk about the monster.

31:46.071 --> 31:46.988
This guy seems to never be seen.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.115
He is, really.

31:48.824 --> 31:49.825
Hey, hey. Wait

31:50.492 --> 31:51.910
In emang there are monsters?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.083
Yah gone mad?

31:58.625 --> 32:00.335
This is the Temple of the Dragon?

32:00.502 --> 32:01.962
How there is a monster?

32:02.337 --> 32:03.547
What do you see?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.590
He is a monster.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.428
Monster

32:11.138 --> 32:12.222
You do not know him?

32:14.516 --> 32:15.767
I do not know him.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.814
I really do not know him.

32:21.398 --> 32:22.732
Why?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.693
He said you know, Josh.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.071
What? Dong Wu please. it's me.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.074
Wu Dong Do you?

32:32.742 --> 32:33.869
What?

32:34.035 --> 32:34.995
You are the Wu Dong?

32:38.165 --> 32:40.041
I surnamed Zhang, Zhang of Zhang

32:40.375 --> 32:42.169
Zhang from Jacky Cheung, Maggie Cheung Zhang from

32:42.335 --> 32:44.504
- Zhang of Zhang Fei, Zhang Liao Zhang from
- Thank you, thank you.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.339
Ga nothing.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.091
Josh wrong people.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.054
I'm sorry.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.892
Let.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.109
He knows me.

33:06.443 --> 33:07.569
Josh!

33:07.736 --> 33:09.279
But now he is lying.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.156
I'm sure there's ruse.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.408
Josh, what actually happened here?

33:13.575 --> 33:14.493
For example,

33:14.659 --> 33:15.660
I ask you.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.455
Come on Dad, I'm not bragging

33:18.622 --> 33:20.457
No, no, I did not say so.

33:20.624 --> 33:21.875
How are you.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.711
If there is anything you can still tell me.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.007
Maybe it's just my illusion.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.522
You both come with me for a while.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.774
Oh

33:47.067 --> 33:48.068
All what news?

33:48.235 --> 33:49.194
Good morning!

33:49.361 --> 33:50.278
Good morning!

33:50.612 --> 33:53.073
Both of you to help clear the table and

33:53.240 --> 33:54.407
- Do not place anything
- Good

33:59.412 --> 34:01.206
I apologize about that yesterday.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.041
You do have to apologize

34:03.291 --> 34:06.461
Now I look like a fool, can see the monster.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.089
I can not tell them.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.259
Yes, thank you for not saying.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.762
Look, I'm not the successor of any kind.

34:15.929 --> 34:19.099
Possible holes in the creature's just an illusion.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.059
You think so?

34:22.811 --> 34:26.188
Well, we go back and try again from scratch.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.821
I do not believe the things neighbors fate of reincarnation.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.324
Well I'll forget about it and you will also forget.

34:36.616 --> 34:37.659
We go home.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.995
Think of it did not happen during the holidays is over.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.581
Flute also is auditory hallucinations.

34:48.795 --> 34:49.795
Flute?

34:57.762 --> 34:58.763
Listen to me!

34:59.055 --> 35:01.391
I just do not believe it would work.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.351
- My dad went there!
- Both Josh

35:03.518 --> 35:04.436
No, Philip.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.104
But we know

35:06.271 --> 35:07.772
The second door is always more difficult to open.

35:07.939 --> 35:08.898
The designs are very complicated.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.859
Of course, I know, but we do not have much time.

35:11.026 --> 35:12.193
I can do the detection

35:12.360 --> 35:13.945
With the X-ray beam

35:14.404 --> 35:16.031
Of course, we want to do

35:16.197 --> 35:17.616
But this needs to be sent to Beijing.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.285
Until the temperature inside the cave was under control.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.038
Gentlemen, we are seeing here.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.249
I think the answer is somewhere here.

35:26.791 --> 35:31.338
We refer to this section.
Very nice.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.259
You know?

35:36.426 --> 35:37.886
I believe we can find the answer to all this.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.597
To seek a breakthrough in the next stage.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.515
Think of the first sentence.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.309
Note here that there are a few sentences and notes.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.518
Yes.
514th
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,687
Actually, we can change the equipment

35:47.854 --> 35:49.606
Samples and sent out a note please!

35:54.611 --> 35:57.489
Tomorrow we bring it to the door in and try it.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.868
Well, today until here first.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.995
Let's save it, put it in my car.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.081
How to go eat sangwo?

36:06.247 --> 36:07.207
Good idea

36:07.832 --> 36:08.833
My treat.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.585
We go eat at a nice Sichuan nga?

36:10.752 --> 36:11.670
Good

36:12.003 --> 36:15.340
Chris rest.

36:16.883 --> 36:17.926
Oh ...
Sorry

36:18.218 --> 36:19.803
I completely forgot this

36:20.303 --> 36:21.846
Now what?

36:22.263 --> 36:23.807
Getting better day by day

36:23.973 --> 36:25.767
I always forget

36:25.934 --> 36:27.060
Good.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.854
Sorry once again

36:30.605 --> 36:32.399
Let's go!

36:33.566 --> 36:36.403
I always think what is happening.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.279
Caramel apples are very tasty.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.198
I'm glad you liked it.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.324
- Josh

36:41.491 --> 36:43.326
File analysis has a potential value

36:43.493 --> 36:45.161
Now we just rely on him.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.790
Yes, we have sent safely to Beijing

36:49.040 --> 36:50.792
We had to pick someone to send it.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.753
[Josh] Why else?
[Chris] Thus we can guarantee his safety.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.464
I heard the flute.

37:00.093 --> 37:01.511
Wow, it's very beautiful Vase.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.012
Josh, I really do ....

37:05.306 --> 37:06.307
Wu Dong!

37:06.474 --> 37:08.560
Wu Dong?
I want to discuss with you

37:08.727 --> 37:09.936
Now you want to discuss?

37:10.103 --> 37:11.146
This time is remembered sayakah?

37:11.312 --> 37:13.940
Sometimes my thoughts better and sometimes my mind messed up.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.025
That's because I've aged.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.444
Pardon!

37:17.610 --> 37:18.778
Wu Dong, ga worry about it anymore.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.655
He was not a successor to hell.

37:20.822 --> 37:21.781
Siau Ling, we go.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.367
No, He emang successor.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.536
He's the one.

37:26.953 --> 37:29.164
Sir, believe me.

37:29.706 --> 37:31.249
He is the successor.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.712
Behold, I have no other choice.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.464
You also can not choose.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.049
Dragon takes you.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.136
Dragon? Beings that exist in the cave Dragon?

37:43.553 --> 37:44.971
Quote you think it is a rabbit?

37:45.138 --> 37:46.931
It is not possible. there are no dragons in this world.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.475
Josh, do not talk anymore.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.478
Dragons, like why?

37:53.521 --> 37:56.107
Dragon will tell you.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.194
Lingling, Lingling

37:59.360 --> 38:00.778
[Chris] Josh
[Ling] I gotta go

38:01.237 --> 38:02.614
Be careful

38:05.033 --> 38:06.034
Josh!

38:06.201 --> 38:07.577
I would not say it.

38:09.037 --> 38:10.079
Lingling.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.122
[Ling] We are here.
[Chris] Josh.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.916
[Dr.Lee] Lingling
[Chris] Josh, let's here.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.793
Do not just wander.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.961
People here are very crowded.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.171
[Josh] I know.
[Chris] Listen to me.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.839
Easy to get lost.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.800
Do not just roads! uda listen?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.218
I just saw a beautiful vase.

38:23.384 --> 38:24.469
Just like

39:36.583 --> 39:38.334
Josh

39:41.296 --> 39:43.715
Listen, I want to go back to the holy shrine

39:45.633 --> 39:46.759
You do not need to follow my

39:47.594 --> 39:49.262
So why are you telling me?

39:49.846 --> 39:51.848
I hope you go away.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.478
Let me go.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.564
At least we need to take the gun.

39:59.731 --> 40:00.440
What?

40:00.607 --> 40:02.775
At least there must be a tranquilizer gun.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.360
You do not melawaklah!

40:04.527 --> 40:06.863
It was a dragon! Although I'm not sure

40:07.030 --> 40:09.991
But if true then he will be spitting fire and eating people.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.327
Chinese dragon will not.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.788
All dragons will surely and ..........

40:16.039 --> 40:17.832
Chinese dragon will not.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.585
How can you know?

40:22.795 --> 40:25.131
Actually, I have a plan.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.760
I tell you, first we went looking at the Temple of the Dragon East

40:32.096 --> 40:34.098
Until the age of 5 I've never ride a bike again.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.725
Still drives well.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.425
He came.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.139
Already come?

41:15.306 --> 41:16.599
I had to come.

41:18.685 --> 41:22.605
Thanks buddah
Thanks Dragon.

41:24.482 --> 41:28.987
Thank you, thank you very much

41:32.115 --> 41:33.533
Thank you very much.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.415
Thank you children of foreigners.

41:40.581 --> 41:41.582
We set off.

41:41.749 --> 41:42.667
We set off.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.294
We set off.

41:46.295 --> 41:49.215
- Come on do not be offended.
- Ah ngapapa, these antiques.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.093
Careful well, thank you.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.013
Go

41:59.308 --> 42:00.351
Be careful!

42:07.442 --> 42:09.110
You're a what?

42:09.277 --> 42:11.029
If creatures that want to hurt someone.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.698
You should not throw stones at the Dragon

42:14.157 --> 42:15.491
You'll thank me

42:15.700 --> 42:17.910
Josh, You have to respect it.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.385
've Seen yet?

42:36.721 --> 42:38.556
How to find it new?

42:38.931 --> 42:40.683
It will come to you.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.257
What do you tertawai?

43:13.508 --> 43:15.760
This is heard. He has come.

44:48.936 --> 44:51.522
You're here, I feel very honored.

44:51.689 --> 44:54.525
[Josh] He will not bite men are?
[Ling] Do not be so rude.

44:55.735 --> 44:57.987
That does not mean not shall the.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.241
Do not be afraid

45:02.742 --> 45:05.036
Once he had never seen a child of strangers.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.038
He knows you know who!

45:07.204 --> 45:08.915
You told him me and you like it.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.961
Ga anything, big guy.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.088
We'll be friends.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.799
Yes, the old dragon.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.801
This world has changed.

45:23.596 --> 45:26.641
He looked very sad.
639th
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,852
Where is Pearl dragon?

45:30.436 --> 45:31.562
Dragon pearl? Pearl Dragon what?

45:31.771 --> 45:33.606
Each Dragon each have a Pearl

45:33.940 --> 45:35.483
Pearls are a source of strength

45:35.650 --> 45:37.276
History books also say like that.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.199
Dragon pearl you where?

46:01.050 --> 46:03.052
Siau Ling

46:10.101 --> 46:11.477
Siau Ling

46:16.274 --> 46:18.359
Siau Ling, you do not look down

46:23.197 --> 46:25.574
Siau Ling, Siau Ling

46:26.534 --> 46:29.537
[Josh] Hold out your hand to me. Be doing well.
[Ling] Josh!

46:34.083 --> 46:35.334
That's all right.

46:36.002 --> 46:37.461
I'm afraid.

46:38.921 --> 46:42.550
[Josh] It's okay. Do not be afraid
[Ling] Ah, why is this?

46:46.137 --> 46:47.805
Why is this?

46:49.515 --> 46:53.102
Please, please!

46:55.938 --> 46:57.982
Yeah!

48:16.602 --> 48:18.729
Beware, Beware

48:28.364 --> 48:29.740
Are you ready?

48:31.700 --> 48:35.329
[Josh] Well, One, .. two, .. three
[Ling] Three

49:21.959 --> 49:24.753
It has been written into the history books.

49:25.212 --> 49:28.883
First-time immemorial in this country by a foreign invasion.

49:29.216 --> 49:31.469
Fortunately, getting help from the Dragon.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.346
Coupled with the Emperor against the enemy's courage.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.432
Saved state.

49:36.765 --> 49:41.228
But the pearl is lost since the war.

49:41.437 --> 49:44.481
The emperor also died in grief.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.693
Or this story should be written so:

49:48.068 --> 49:51.489
Truth is still hidden in the long history

49:51.822 --> 49:58.245
Even the emperor did not die in the battlefield and the pearl is not lost

49:58.787 --> 50:02.166
The emperor's favorite daughter became Queen of the Kingdom.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.127
- To overcome the grief-stricken.
[Princess] Stop

50:06.504 --> 50:10.049
[Princess] Pearl will be buried with my father here!
- He was very angry

50:10.216 --> 50:14.094
- Blaming the death of his father at the Pearl Dragon.
[Historian] Princess

50:14.929 --> 50:16.722
Dragons need it

50:18.015 --> 50:21.769
He will always protect my dad forever!

50:21.936 --> 50:23.354
To punish the Dragon

50:23.562 --> 50:27.399
Princess Pearl ordering must ..

50:27.566 --> 50:29.401
Buried along with the King.

50:41.914 --> 50:43.624
No one will know this truth.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.460
Should not let people know that pearls are here.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.754
To keep a secret.

50:48.963 --> 50:50.631
He destroyed the records of historians.

50:50.839 --> 50:53.217
- And ordered to rewrite the whole story
[Princess] What is happening today.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.094
Day's events should not be anyone to say it out.

50:56.387 --> 51:00.140
Otherwise, none of you may live.

51:00.432 --> 51:05.396
- In the new story, Pearl is not buried in the tomb of Emperor
[Princess] you have to follow my words to write the history of my King.

51:05.688 --> 51:08.065
- But missing on the battlefield.
[Historian] Both daughters.

51:09.066 --> 51:13.779
- Since this will be passed on as history.
[Princess] A general

51:14.029 --> 51:20.369
[Princess] For the sake of his own country fight it out.
- And thousands of years Dragon has been waiting for

51:20.619 --> 51:21.996
until one day

51:22.746 --> 51:25.666
He can re-find the missing pearls.

51:26.125 --> 51:30.754
And then returned to Khayangan.

51:36.635 --> 51:40.472
Inside the tomb? Pearl?

51:41.015 --> 51:43.726
[Wu Dong] Really?
[Ling] Yes, we have also seen it.

51:43.892 --> 51:45.936
Not like it was written in the book.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.855
Dragon tells of Pearl

51:48.063 --> 51:50.357
Which has been written to confuse grave robbers.

51:50.524 --> 51:55.112
Princess Pearl hopes to protect his father. Forever.

51:55.863 --> 51:57.072
So the entrance of the tomb.

51:57.656 --> 51:59.825
They have opened the door first.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.202
[Josh] Pearl Dragon.
[Ling] Then what should we do?

52:02.369 --> 52:03.537
Successor destiny!

52:03.704 --> 52:06.248
You must return to the Dragon Pearl Dragon.

52:07.624 --> 52:10.169
[Wu Dong] It is the responsibility of you!
[Ling] I?

52:10.502 --> 52:12.004
If you do not do.

52:12.171 --> 52:14.131
Pearls will be placed in museums or maybe worse

52:14.340 --> 52:16.592
The stranger, you're right.

52:18.177 --> 52:19.845
You must do something quickly.

52:20.054 --> 52:22.389
Go!

52:23.932 --> 52:26.977
Wait, Philip said that the water will rise.

52:27.186 --> 52:28.854
Will flood the entire tomb!

52:29.146 --> 52:31.273
Will destroy all the objects that exist within.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.110
Waw ...

52:36.862 --> 52:39.156
[Josh] Siau Ling, what would you do?
[Ling] I'll tell my mom.

52:39.656 --> 52:40.783
You should not be so.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.369
[Ling] This is the fastest way.
[Josh] It's not the best way.

52:43.577 --> 52:44.870
He could not believe you.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.246
You see what happened to my last.

52:46.455 --> 52:48.707
I do not like about you.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.711
Siau Ling

53:01.178 --> 53:04.056
[Dr. Lee] Please wrapped, I will send it to Beijing!
- Good

53:06.558 --> 53:08.435
Can I make suggestions?

53:09.228 --> 53:11.939
Better give me time to learn this ancient book.

53:12.398 --> 53:14.149
I could see a few days.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.235
Discover new perspectives.

53:16.402 --> 53:18.779
Philip is not your expertise.

53:18.987 --> 53:21.699
Chris you can not say so.

53:22.282 --> 53:24.118
I've studied many ancient books.

53:24.284 --> 53:26.412
I know where to answer the mystery.

53:26.787 --> 53:27.579
I think you know

53:27.746 --> 53:29.706
We better be the best on our own field.

53:29.873 --> 53:33.252
[Dr. Lee] Comrades, please book sent immediately to Beijing.
[Chris] It's obviously not good, why not ...

53:33.460 --> 53:34.461
Mama

53:39.174 --> 53:42.511
There is one thing I want to say.

53:43.178 --> 53:45.055
We flew together, to see the past

53:45.222 --> 53:46.849
Dragon brings us

53:47.433 --> 53:49.852
Mama, why do you have that?

53:50.686 --> 53:52.521
I am very worried about you Lingling.

53:52.688 --> 53:55.357
We must return to the Dragon Pearl Dragon.

53:55.524 --> 53:56.984
Inside the tomb

53:58.527 --> 54:01.029
I think he really should be checked properly.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.949
Sometimes a small amount of bleeding of the brain can cause hallucinations.

54:27.931 --> 54:29.266
It was too funny, mama.

54:29.433 --> 54:30.893
[Josh] Hey Dad.
[Chris] Wait Josh.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.060
I went to the line below.

54:32.227 --> 54:33.854
[Josh] I think I found a clue.
[Chris] Josh, please.

54:34.021 --> 54:35.105
Josh and I have seen it.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.065
Is Josh should also do a check?

54:37.232 --> 54:38.358
Lingling.

54:39.234 --> 54:40.277
Yes, the dragon one.

54:40.444 --> 54:41.737
We flew along with the dragon.

54:41.904 --> 54:43.655
Also returning to the ancient

54:44.990 --> 54:46.200
It's really a compliment

54:56.794 --> 54:58.504
What more do you want to convey?

54:59.087 --> 55:00.297
What do you mean?

55:02.925 --> 55:04.927
Lingling I do not know why.

55:05.093 --> 55:07.763
I also do not know where he could tell.

55:07.930 --> 55:10.557
But I'm fine, really understand the situation.

55:10.849 --> 55:12.059
And I do not?

55:12.643 --> 55:14.228
I'm not saying that.

55:14.520 --> 55:15.771
But you think so.

55:16.396 --> 55:18.565
Next time I take you up the mountain. They look good!

55:18.857 --> 55:20.108
Very, very nice.

55:21.735 --> 55:23.946
Do you know Josh?

55:24.238 --> 55:26.281
You can come very good.

55:26.490 --> 55:28.951
If you are not happy, I do not blame you.

55:29.117 --> 55:31.870
One day you will understand Believe me!

55:32.204 --> 55:33.205
But now

55:33.831 --> 55:37.709
You hallucinations, and attitudes you

55:39.753 --> 55:42.798
I think you have to understand that I here is very busy

55:43.006 --> 55:44.633
There are a lot of work to be done

55:44.800 --> 55:45.926
Which is also a great thing.

55:46.093 --> 55:48.011
And we are now at stake

55:48.512 --> 55:51.557
The problem is enough, enough Josh!

55:59.189 --> 56:00.816
Slowly-lahanlah.

56:05.571 --> 56:07.781
I told you they would not believe.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.118
Mama I do not believe me makes me sad.

56:12.452 --> 56:14.204
Already feeling now?

56:16.331 --> 56:17.499
You know?

56:17.916 --> 56:20.085
I have found the entrance to the tomb.

56:20.794 --> 56:23.630
What?

56:24.047 --> 56:26.717
Lingling, we go.
782nd
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,016
- Hey
- Hey

56:34.182 --> 56:35.183
Are you okay?

56:35.350 --> 56:36.560
Still good.

56:37.311 --> 56:41.315
Ga wrong I listen? You know how to get into the tomb!

56:42.899 --> 56:45.235
Of course, I do not need to know why.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.363
I think it's very important.
788th
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:57,873
Well maybe I can help a little you.

57:00.292 --> 57:01.668
Welcome to my lair

57:01.877 --> 57:03.086
You read all this?

57:03.295 --> 57:07.382
Sure, the innards of this game getting to know better.

57:08.050 --> 57:09.509
The book will not be exhausted studied.

57:09.676 --> 57:11.219
- Sit down Josh.
- Thank you.

57:11.678 --> 57:15.515
Listen, you're very enthusiastic.

57:16.475 --> 57:18.727
Your ability to solve puzzles are also very great.

57:18.894 --> 57:21.939
I believe you have found a way.

57:22.314 --> 57:23.357
The trick?

57:25.484 --> 57:29.613
Dad you're not sure the book is the key to the tomb.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.198
He thinks the answer is in the book.

57:31.823 --> 57:34.368
I do not feel that way.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.537
The holes in the book.

57:38.664 --> 57:42.542
You've seen it. What can you see?

57:42.793 --> 57:45.587
How can you not honestly tell you my father?

57:45.921 --> 57:48.507
It's useless, my father did not believe me.

57:48.674 --> 57:52.135
Come on all parents must be stubborn.

57:54.179 --> 57:57.641
What do you recanakan?

58:00.268 --> 58:02.312
Actually, I'm also not clear.

58:04.481 --> 58:05.440
Actually.

58:05.607 --> 58:07.776
I suggest you look carefully these ancient books.

58:07.984 --> 58:09.236
Before then sent to Beijing

58:09.444 --> 58:11.780
Or before being taken by thieves.

58:12.072 --> 58:14.241
The thief that day almost succeeded.

58:14.491 --> 58:16.326
I was always told to put the place of storage of goods.

58:16.535 --> 58:17.577
A safe place.

58:17.744 --> 58:21.164
Just in place under the table, too dangerous.

58:21.373 --> 58:22.374
But

58:23.041 --> 58:27.671
Your father change their password combination is new in the security box.
But what combination?

58:28.463 --> 58:32.926
This is still a mystery?

59:17.888 --> 59:19.264
Are you tired?

59:24.186 --> 59:26.021
[Dr. Lee] You're still angry with me?
[Ling] Ga may I?

59:26.229 --> 59:28.064
Next time remind me if I am angry again.

59:28.273 --> 59:30.275
Remind me to do a brain.

59:30.942 --> 59:32.486
I just hope you're okay.

59:34.071 --> 59:35.572
Just that it?

59:36.031 --> 59:40.368
Well, do so. Ok?

59:44.122 --> 59:46.249
Well, good night!

59:47.918 --> 59:49.795
Hand you a cold, we go heat up first.

59:49.961 --> 59:52.005
Come, come, come, let's

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:10.524
Strange, mother's birthday?

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:45.100
Why did you come here

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.061
Nothing to do with you. You yourselves why here?

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:49.312
As you

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.606
You take it for what?

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:52.732
We must get into the tomb

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:53.900
However, if

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.277
[Josh] Then I put back
[Ling] Wait.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.154
We check carefully.

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.531
Instantly solve all. Reveal the truth!

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.036
Okay, let's go!

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.873
The good, anyways I like antiques

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:30.896
[Philip] brother.

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:32.939
[Philip] Called brother to come.
[Guard] Well

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.859
- Thanks

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.487
- Go there! Quick, quick.
- Good good good

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.869
[Philip] Let's just in the eating. Do not hesitate
[Guard] Well dinner today

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:01.801
Let's run.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.941
China also has zombiekah?

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:18.443
There are only Western movies

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:20.987
I saw there.

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:23.239
Look fast, look here.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:26.117
The door has no handle and key hole, too good.

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:28.495
There may be a hidden button?

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:29.579
I do not know.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:30.914
Hey come look at this

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.332
I saw this yesterday.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:34.334
They focus entirely on the text

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.877
But ignoring the most obvious

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:38.171
You know what you're doing it?

01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:39.631
Not

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:49.849
Hey at least here there are no hidden poison dart like a weapon, or a rolling stone.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.353
But I do not know, what will next dilakukkan.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:58.316
Well, apparently this is not a coincidence.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:06.908
But now

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.245
[Ling] Press down
[Josh] What?

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.288
[Ling] Press him.
[Josh] Press what?

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.249
Dragon

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.375
Well I will try.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:19.462
Ready? Let equally disposable labor.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.801
Already open, continue, continue.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.879
Here the Emperor and Empress

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.672
My ancestors.

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.008
So the pearl is not here!

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:51.179
Princess clearly ordered to be placed here.

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.808
Maybe we forgot something.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.352
Maybe it's not true

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.145
Now what?

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.148
He is here, I know it.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:13.660
Let me hold

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.063
Pause.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.832
Siau Ling, are you all how well?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.859
[Philip] Good Josh.
[Josh] Hey Philip you arrive on time.

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:36.612
Yes ga wrong, let me take him away.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.238
What?

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:41.826
Your father and Dr. Lee.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.037
They think I'm stupid

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:48.707
But I know better than anyone else about this Dragon Pearl.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.835
As they studied this tomb.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.212
I have all the information about which I have told you.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:57.175
Pearl Dragon has the power of Magic.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.176
Kekuatann infinite.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:02.513
I just wanted to see how strong.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.807
Pearls give him, Josh.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:06.643
Not

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:08.060
Give me your pearls.

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.531
Siau Ling

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:28.831
Josh

01:09:58.486 --> 01:09:59.612
Josh

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:28.599
Siau Ling!

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.101
Bye!

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.414
Hey hurry up!

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.135
Josh!

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.570
Pursue.

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:53.518
There.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.482
Look carefully, not to lose.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:15.248
Josh, Josh.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.465
Is this what you want?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.218
I can not find Josh, do you see?

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:28.594
Lingling how?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.555
You must see this.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:33.724
Oh soil test report.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:36.060
This is the test results of samples sent to Beijing.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.605
In emang no water but no improvement.

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:44.485
So, Philip lied to us by showing the water levels rise?

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:47.029
His report is false

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.407
Philip could be where?

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:52.285
And also the children?

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:33.117
- Guards!
- Guards!

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:34.452
Guard!

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:35.620
Lingling

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.746
Josh

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.247
Lingling

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.041
There are people below.

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.547
This is why is that?

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:49.634
[Dr. Lee] Who did it? who did it?
[Guard] Philip Dukes

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:54.764
Dukes

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.451
Wheels are stuck, you think of ways

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.788
Fast, Fast.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.001
Siau Ling Well, you go first.

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.252
I tried to stop them.

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:26.921
Take care, Josh.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.025
Wait ...

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:50.111
That's all right.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:52.446
I know where they are

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.581
Who's there?

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.334

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:07.670

[Josh] Come lah.
[Phililp] Let him, all returned.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:12.633
Ga have to ignore him.

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.072
Rapidly rising upwards.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.366
Quick.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:40.995
Are you sure that they are in the holy temple?

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:44.165
I'm not sure but I expect them.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:46.625
Gosh.

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:54.175

I went first

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.644
I go with you.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:34.316

Once the new right.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.321
Let us think for a minute.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:06.116
You give up the Pearl then you should leave this place.

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:09.787
Give me the bag.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:20.297

[Josh] He wanted the Pearl Dragon
[Chris] What do you do?

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:41.986
But it should not be given.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.113

I knew the dragon would come to help me.

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:48.477
This is amazing.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.730
I can not believe something like this.

01:25:57.277 --> 01:26:01.198
Sorry, I suspect you.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:16.588
Good, down from here.

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:18.340
Farewell criminals One!

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:19.800
Two criminals goodbye!

01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:21.093
Three criminals goodbye!

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.222
Be careful, criminals!

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.771
If you have a big step before doing it ..

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.606
Notify me may I?

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:36.858
Dad, I've repeatedly mengatakkannya

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:39.069
I'm kidding, kidding.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:42.823
The next time I still can not believe you.

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:47.411
Then you should hit me.

01:26:50.497 --> 01:26:52.249
You're a great kid

01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:54.960
I'm proud of you.

01:26:59.965 --> 01:27:02.717
I grew up like you want, learn archeology.

01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:05.095
Study Archaeology?

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:08.014
Maybe after you grow.

There are many things waiting for you to explore

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:14.187
Make yourself more valuable.

Mama-written book of it's not all true.

01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:26.742
I think this history should be rewritten.

01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:29.911
It's time to rewrite the truth.
