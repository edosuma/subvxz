00:53.344 --> 00:54.262
No!

[panting]

00:57.223 --> 00:58.892
Stop the wedding!

00:58.975 --> 00:59.893
Wait!

01:01.770 --> 01:03.146
[Abigail] Dearly beloved,

01:03.229 --> 01:06.274
we are gathered here today
to join this fine gentleman

01:06.357 --> 01:08.568
-and this exceptional lady...
-[whinnies]

01:08.651 --> 01:11.029
...in the bonds of horsey matrimony.

01:11.112 --> 01:15.075
Let their love serve as a reminder
of the truest form of adorableness.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.701
And now, before witnesses--

01:16.785 --> 01:18.203
-[door slams open]
-[Lucky] Stop the wedding!

01:18.286 --> 01:19.454
[panting]

01:19.537 --> 01:20.914
What's wrong?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.500
[sighs] I forgot the rings.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.294
Lucky, that's the one thing you had to do!

01:26.377 --> 01:28.546
Well, that and be on time,
which you didn't do either!

01:28.630 --> 01:31.925
I know. But Kate's moving in today,
so I started to clean my room,

01:32.008 --> 01:35.094
but then I thought,
"Why give her unrealistic expectations?"

01:35.178 --> 01:37.931
My dad caught me sneaking out,
so I had to clean anyways,

01:38.014 --> 01:40.975
and next thing I knew,
I heard the wedding march.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.685
That was me!

01:42.769 --> 01:44.354
I know and good job.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.150
[clears throat]

01:49.609 --> 01:52.237
It's customary to tip the band.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.739
-No.
-[groans]

01:54.823 --> 01:56.324
[growls]

01:56.407 --> 01:59.536
Being ring bearer is your only job
at your dad's wedding tomorrow.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.788
It's the reason
we're doing this practice.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.333
I know, which is why it's actually good
that I forgot them today,

02:05.416 --> 02:07.794
so I've gotten the mess-up out
of my system.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.045
-Um...
-[groans]

02:10.130 --> 02:11.756
Everything's fine.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.967
The best horse and I will go get
the rings now,

02:14.050 --> 02:17.137
and we'll get these two hitched.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.181
Sorry, Lucky, but this wedding is off.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.599
What? Why?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.561
The bride and groom have seen
each other... before the ceremony!

02:24.644 --> 02:28.148
Everyone knows that's bad luck.
The wedding is cursed.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.315
[Lucky] Are you kidding?

02:29.399 --> 02:33.361
I have never been more serious
in my life.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.780
Abigail, we've been over this.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.157
Curses aren't real.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.368
Oh, yeah? Then what about when you walked
under the barn ladder

02:40.451 --> 02:43.454
-and sprained your ankle right after?
-That's because I tripped.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.998
Or when you saw a black cat

02:45.081 --> 02:48.209
and Chica Linda's bridle broke
the very next day?

02:48.293 --> 02:50.295
-[stutters]
-Or when you broke that mirror

02:50.378 --> 02:52.046
and got gum stuck in your hair?

02:53.089 --> 02:54.507
Okay, that did happen.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.594
It's good you have me to tell you
how superstitions work, Lucky

02:57.677 --> 02:59.929
Who knows what kind of damage
you could have done?

03:00.513 --> 03:02.599
Don't worry, Lucky.
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.809
Tomorrow's gonna be a piece of cake.

03:04.893 --> 03:08.021
-Cake?
-Not till the real wedding tomorrow.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.480
Aw, nuts.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.694
[knock on door]

03:15.486 --> 03:16.613
Thank you, Lucky.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.616
I must have misplaced my key.
I can't find it anywhere.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.200
Of all the days to lose it...

03:21.284 --> 03:23.036
And a good morning to you, too.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.413
Oh, no sassing now.
We've got too much to do!

03:25.496 --> 03:28.082
Well, everyone is in the living room
ready to work.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.209
Good. The harp player is coming at one.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.836
The ice sculpture's being delivered
at two.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.837
Then there's the rings.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.963
Oh! The rings!

03:34.047 --> 03:37.717
Don't worry, Aunt Cora.
I've got them right here, safe and sound.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.179
Be right back.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.515
[sighs]

03:45.725 --> 03:49.062
[Lucky groans] Come on, where are you?

03:49.145 --> 03:52.148
[grunting]

03:54.943 --> 03:57.320
-Anyone hungry for pancakes?
-[gasps] The groom!

03:57.403 --> 03:59.447
-Oh!
-[Abigail yelling, Jim chuckles]

03:59.530 --> 04:01.241
Jim! Get out!

04:01.324 --> 04:03.284
You can't see me before the wedding.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.079
-I'm not looking, but you all need to eat.
-[grunts]

04:06.162 --> 04:07.455
[Jim] Ooh!

04:07.538 --> 04:09.874
Phew. That was a close call.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.377
-Ouch!
-Oh, Abigail, stand still.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.462
There are a million things I have to do,

04:14.545 --> 04:17.257
and poking you with a sewing needle
is not one of them.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.550
We can help, Miss Prescott.
What do you need?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.677
Wonderful.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.845
You girls can decorate the bridal chariot,

04:22.929 --> 04:25.890
then pick up the bouquet and the cake
and bring them back here.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.100
-Sure.
-No problem.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.102
Lucky? Did you hear me?

04:29.185 --> 04:33.564
Hey, have any of you seen
two small metal circular things?

04:33.648 --> 04:35.400
Like the rings?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.111
Similar.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.488
They're, uh... they're ring-like.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.491
[sighs] Yeah, it's the rings.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.536
I put them in separate safe spots
where I would remember them.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.537
I forgot.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.289
Oh, Lucky, honestly.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.415
It's all right.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.500
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.128
-Where was the last place you saw them?
-Up in my room.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.130
Oh! I should check my room!

04:58.006 --> 04:59.299
Uh, Lucky?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.844
I just found a ring in the flour.
You know anything about that?

05:02.927 --> 05:05.930
Right! Flores, flour.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.724
I hid Kate's ring in the flour.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.934
-[Kate gasps] Lucky! I found one!
-Wait! No!

05:10.018 --> 05:12.478
-[Cora] Abigail! Stay still.
-Ouch! No!

05:13.354 --> 05:16.316
[chuckles] Guess we might have
some bad luck today.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.735
Well, seeing you is always worth the risk.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.325
[Cora] Oh, honestly.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.952
I tried to stop her, Lucky,
but I wasn't fast enough.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.163
The wedding's cursed,
and it's all my fault.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.622
No, it's not.

05:32.248 --> 05:36.461
[sighs] You're right. It's Lucky's fault.
She's the one who lost the rings.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.546
I meant the wedding's not cursed.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.339
It's just a silly superstition.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.342
We can't protect her, Pru.
What Lucky has done is--

05:43.426 --> 05:46.220
-Ow!
-Lucky, it's fine.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.556
Of course it is.
I don't believe in superstitions.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.058
-[flames whoosh]
-[Jim] Oh!

05:50.141 --> 05:53.186
Nothing to worry about.
Just a little grease fire.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.521
Also, your pancakes are ready.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.981
Oh!

05:57.065 --> 05:58.274
That means nothing.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.195
[Abigail] Miss Flores saw your dad
for a few seconds,

06:02.278 --> 06:05.365
so the wedding probably isn't
super cursed, just a little cursed.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.282
-[growls]
-Unless...

06:06.365 --> 06:08.618
-It isn't cursed!
-What about the fire?

06:08.701 --> 06:10.578
It happened
right after they saw each other.

06:10.661 --> 06:11.996
The pancakes were ruined!

06:12.080 --> 06:15.374
My dad sets fires all the time.
He's not great in the kitchen.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.959
[Spirit neighs approvingly]

06:17.043 --> 06:18.795
-But--
-Nothing bad is going to happen

06:18.878 --> 06:21.380
because I'm not going to let
anything bad happen!

06:21.464 --> 06:23.257
This wedding is gonna be perfect.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.884
Starting with this cart.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.013
It's perfect.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.891
Not yet. It just needs...

06:34.310 --> 06:36.229
Here. And you.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.606

06:38.689 --> 06:41.692

06:47.907 --> 06:48.783
[Boomerang snorts]

06:49.700 --> 06:50.827
-It's the curse!
-No.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.120
-But-- Ugh!
-No.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.039
The cart is okay,
so I haven't messed up anything.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.625
Let's get this arch back up... somehow,

06:57.708 --> 07:00.044
and then off to the rest of our errands.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.842
[Lucky] Okay, pals, we're back on track.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.343
Cart, decorated.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.053
Arch, standing.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.638
Bouquet, in hand.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.641
-Now all we need to do is get the cake.
-And remember the rings.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.060
Ooh, this bouquet is so fancy.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.562
Even the bees are fancy.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.646
-[bees buzzing]

[snorts]

07:44.839 --> 07:47.842
That was just a coincidence, right?

07:47.925 --> 07:51.095
Right. Donkeys eat flowers.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.889
[chuckles] It's natural.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.891
More like supernatural.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.101
Ow! You've got to stop doing that.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.312
And you've got to stop
trying to upset Lucky

07:59.395 --> 08:01.522
with this ridiculous superstition talk.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.690
I'm trying to help her.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.900
If we know the curse is coming,

08:03.983 --> 08:06.903
we can be on alert
and stop the bad stuff before it happens.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.905
But the bad stuff's already happening!

08:08.988 --> 08:11.616
-Miss Flores' bouquet is ruined!
-[Pru] No problem.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.785
I know where we can get
an even bigger, better bouquet.

[gasps] Careful!

08:42.270 --> 08:43.731
It's okay. I got it.

08:43.813 --> 08:45.358
Whoa! Oh, I don't got it!

08:45.441 --> 08:46.943
Help! [grunts]

-[Lucky] Easy, Spirit.

[sighs]

08:52.073 --> 08:53.157
There.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.534
Take that, curse!

08:54.617 --> 08:56.410
-We did it!
-[Abigail] Don't jinx it.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.329
We still need to get the cake home,

08:58.412 --> 09:02.166
and there's an evil force out there
just waiting to pounce.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.167
Abigail!

09:03.251 --> 09:05.169
I'm not talking about the curse.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.171
I'm talking about...

09:22.270 --> 09:23.396

-Surrender that cake! [shouts]
-[brays]

10:07.898 --> 10:09.108
[girls screaming]

10:09.191 --> 10:11.235
Aah! Whoa!

10:11.319 --> 10:13.446
Hey! Horse cheated!

10:13.529 --> 10:14.614
[growls]

10:14.697 --> 10:16.240
[chuckles] Thanks, boy.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.242
-[Spirit snorts]
-Whoa!

10:18.326 --> 10:19.702
[snorts]

10:26.334 --> 10:27.251
[Pru] We made it.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.045
[Lucky] We got to get down the walk,

10:29.128 --> 10:32.465
up the stairs, through the door
and to the counter.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.507
Everyone ready?

10:34.133 --> 10:37.136
-One, two, three.
-[Pru grunts]

10:37.887 --> 10:39.930
[Lucky] Okay, we got this.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.850
Okay, here we go now.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.269
Please don't let the curse be real.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.854
-Please don't let the curse be real.
-[crow cawing]

10:46.937 --> 10:48.898
-Please don't let the curse be real.
-[gasps]

10:48.981 --> 10:50.316
Please don't let the curse be real.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.068
-[whimpers]
-[caws]

10:52.151 --> 10:54.028
-[all shout]
-[caws]

10:54.111 --> 10:55.446
-[yells]
-[Pru] Whoa!

10:55.529 --> 10:56.656
[Abigail] Careful!

10:56.739 --> 10:57.865
[Pru] Slow.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.868
-It's fine. We got this.
-[Abigail] Oh.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.287
Please don't let the curse be real.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.164
Please don't let the-- Aah!

11:06.374 --> 11:07.958
[Pru] All right, pals, come on.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.294
-Please don't let the curse be real.
-[Abigail] Steady.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.712
-Please don't let the curse be real.
-Oh!

11:11.796 --> 11:14.298
-[frog croaks]
-[Lucky gasps] Frog.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.177
[Lucky] Oh, come on!

11:18.260 --> 11:20.179
[boy] Yeah! Oh! I'm gonna catch you!

11:20.262 --> 11:22.098
-[Abigail] Shoo! Shoo!
-[Spirit neighs]

11:22.181 --> 11:23.516
[boy] Hey! Come back!

11:23.599 --> 11:24.892
[wind howls softly]

11:24.975 --> 11:26.977
[gasps, exhales]

11:27.770 --> 11:29.313
-Please don't let the curse be real.
-[Pru] Easy.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.690
Please don't let the curse be real.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.110
-[Pru] Am I getting near the steps?
-[all gasp]

11:34.193 --> 11:35.611
[Pru and Lucky sigh]

11:36.153 --> 11:38.781
Please don't let the curse be real.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.908
-Please don't let the curse be real.
-[Abigail] Almost there.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.535
-Please don't let the curse be real.
-[Pru] In the house.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.121
-[Abigail grunts]
-[Pru] And... there.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.122
[all shout]

11:46.205 --> 11:50.501
[Lucky] We'll just move real slow.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.128
-[all sigh]
-[Lucky] We did it!

11:52.211 --> 11:54.338
-[honks]
-Aah!

11:54.422 --> 11:55.256
[gasps]

12:08.644 --> 12:09.812
[gasps]

12:09.895 --> 12:12.148
[screams] I've ruined the cake!

12:12.231 --> 12:13.732
The curse, it's happening!

12:13.816 --> 12:16.569
Lucky, for the last time,
there's no such thing.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.738
Then how come ever since my dad
and Miss Flores saw each other,

12:19.822 --> 12:21.157
everything has gone wrong?

12:21.240 --> 12:25.161
If there's no curse, then what is it?
Am I causing it without even knowing?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.371
Is that even possible? Is it?

12:27.455 --> 12:29.748
Lucky, it's okay.

12:29.832 --> 12:30.958
No, it's not!

12:31.041 --> 12:31.917
My dad is so happy!

12:32.001 --> 12:34.378
And Miss Flores and I
are actually getting along!

12:34.462 --> 12:36.964
I just can't believe
I'm letting them down again.

12:37.047 --> 12:37.965
You're not.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.384
We fixed the archway,
we fixed the bouquet,

12:40.468 --> 12:42.595
and we can fix this, too...

12:42.678 --> 12:43.679
somehow?

12:43.762 --> 12:45.973
There's no way to fix this.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.016
[sighs]

12:47.099 --> 12:47.975
Sure there is!

12:48.058 --> 12:52.188
Snips has destroyed every birthday cake
my family has baked for the past... ever.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.190
I've become an expert
at rebuilding them.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.609
You don't want to see my dad
when he doesn't get dessert.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.986
One time, he was nailing a loose step
on the porch

12:59.069 --> 13:01.780
when he caught Snips sneaking out
covered with frosting.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.617
So he took the claw hammer
he was holding and--

13:06.494 --> 13:08.871
The point is, we can fix this.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.498
-We can?
-How?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.999
With pies!

13:12.082 --> 13:16.420
I'll buttress the side here
with, uh, dense peach...

13:16.504 --> 13:20.132
and then reinforce the upper tiers
with lighter rhubarb

13:20.216 --> 13:22.259
and patch it all up with frosting!

13:22.343 --> 13:26.222
Pie? In a cake? Covered in frosting?

13:26.305 --> 13:27.890
That sounds...

13:28.724 --> 13:29.850
Delicious.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.018
It is.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.229
Now, off to the general store for mortar--

13:33.312 --> 13:35.314
I mean frosting. [chuckles]

13:36.524 --> 13:38.234
Once we fix the cake, we're done.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.818
It's the last thing on our list.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.071
I won't have to worry
about messing up anything else.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.656
Except the rings.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.032
Except that.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.617
Maybe write it on my hand?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.202
[chuffs]

13:48.285 --> 13:52.039
So, are you finally convinced
there's no such thing as a curse?

13:52.122 --> 13:53.666
[sighs] Yes.

13:53.749 --> 13:57.461
What's the word on everyone's tongue
this fine day, friends?

13:57.545 --> 13:58.963
Romance!

13:59.046 --> 14:00.256
Oh, no.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.175
[groans] You go get the cake supplies.
I'll handle this.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.262
My uncle and his beautiful bride
are getting married,

14:06.345 --> 14:09.265
and you can feel a little
of the love yourself.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.601
Take an oh-so-romantic ride
with someone you love!

14:12.685 --> 14:13.853
Just a nickel!

14:14.562 --> 14:15.896
[gasps]

14:18.899 --> 14:20.484
Cousin Julian, wait!

14:20.568 --> 14:21.861
You can't take her money.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.529
I'm the someone she loves!

14:25.948 --> 14:26.866
I'll do anything.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.702
You got a sister?
I got a real good one I can trade you.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.037
-[Lucky] Julian! What are you doing?
-[gasps]

14:32.121 --> 14:34.290
-[Spirit neighs]
-What are any of you doing?

14:34.373 --> 14:36.292
Get out of here! Scat!

14:36.375 --> 14:37.585
Go on!

14:37.668 --> 14:39.336
[growls] Julian!

14:39.420 --> 14:42.089
Of all the days
to pull one of your lame schemes,

14:42.172 --> 14:44.925
you had to pick my dad's wedding day!

14:45.009 --> 14:48.095
Take it easy, RF.
There's not a scratch on it!

14:48.178 --> 14:49.972
I'd be happy to cut you in if you want.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.515
Cut me in?

14:51.599 --> 14:52.808
Cut me in?

14:53.392 --> 14:56.270
Or I could just cut myself out.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.731
Which I will do right now.

14:58.814 --> 14:59.940
See you at the wedding!

15:00.024 --> 15:03.319
Huh. That was easier
than I thought it would be.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.905
Well, let's see how much damage he did.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.906
[grunts]

15:08.157 --> 15:11.201
Wow, Spirit. It got windy really fast.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.203
Spirit?

15:13.287 --> 15:14.371
[chuffs]

15:14.455 --> 15:16.123
[gasps] Spirit!

15:16.832 --> 15:18.000
[gasps]

15:18.083 --> 15:19.752
Julian forgot the brake!

15:19.835 --> 15:21.128
[grunts]

15:21.211 --> 15:22.922
[gasps, groans]

15:23.005 --> 15:24.548
[gasps, whimpers]

15:24.632 --> 15:25.799
-[man] Aah!
-[woman] Ooh!

15:27.426 --> 15:30.804
[Lucky] Oh, the curse is real!

15:30.888 --> 15:32.765
Not good! Oh!

15:32.848 --> 15:34.934
-Aah!
-[neighs]

15:35.017 --> 15:37.061
Spirit, help!

15:37.144 --> 15:38.354
Help!

15:38.979 --> 15:40.564
-Aah!
-[Spirit neighs]

15:43.651 --> 15:45.235
[grunts]

15:46.236 --> 15:47.279
[crashes]

15:51.033 --> 15:52.242
Oh, no.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.578
[chuffs, snorts]

15:56.872 --> 15:59.166
[sighs]

15:59.249 --> 16:00.167
[groans]

16:00.250 --> 16:01.794
Okay, curse, you win.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.171
The hitch is ruined.
Kate will have to walk.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.172
Are you satisfied?

16:05.255 --> 16:08.592
You all done, or have you got
any other surprises in store for me?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.679
[grunting]

16:13.681 --> 16:14.598
Aah!

16:14.682 --> 16:16.892
[grunts, groans]

16:19.478 --> 16:21.188
[gasps] You?

16:21.897 --> 16:24.608
Is that any way to greet your grandfather?

16:32.282 --> 16:36.578
I had hoped that this Miss Flores
would reign you in where your aunt failed,

16:36.662 --> 16:38.664
but I see that I was mistaken.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.420
You've got it all wrong, Grandpa.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.923
Kate is great.
She's really adventurous and brave and--

16:48.007 --> 16:48.966
"Adventurous"?

16:49.049 --> 16:50.634
And she's a really good teacher!

16:50.718 --> 16:52.720
She took us camping to dig for fossils.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.430
Well, they weren't really fossils.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.433
They were just cow bones Kate buried,
but we did find real fossils!

16:57.516 --> 16:59.435
You call her Kate?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.020
She buries cow bones?

17:01.645 --> 17:02.855
Oh, yeah, that.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.941
She did kind of lie to us,
but her intentions were good.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.859
Lying to children--

17:07.943 --> 17:09.778
she sounds untrustworthy.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.864
Not at all! She's great with kids!

17:11.946 --> 17:14.657
She ought to be.
She grew up in an orphanage full of 'em.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.368
So the lady has no family?

17:17.786 --> 17:21.205
No. That's probably why she wants
to become part of ours.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.416
I'll bet she does.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.462
Wait. No, Grandpa, you don't understand!

17:26.545 --> 17:27.880
What I'm trying to say is--

17:27.963 --> 17:30.257
You've said quite enough. Thank you.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.259
I was prepared to accept this union,

17:32.342 --> 17:34.678
but your words
have convinced me otherwise.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.056
I must speak to your father right away.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.891
Grandpa! Wait!

17:38.974 --> 17:41.268
Ugh! Stupid curse!

17:41.727 --> 17:43.270
Ugh! Stupid cart!

17:43.353 --> 17:44.605
[neighs]

17:44.688 --> 17:46.607
[humming "Wedding March"]

17:46.690 --> 17:48.067
-Dad!
-What do you think?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.485
You can't get married!

17:50.069 --> 17:51.070
That bad, huh?

17:51.153 --> 17:52.780
I thought I looked pretty good.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.491
[sighs] You look great,
but there's a curse.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.786
I thought I had beaten it,
but then the curse sent Grandpa, and--

17:58.869 --> 18:00.287
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.915
First of all,
a curse didn't send your grandfather.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.291
-We invited him.
-No--

18:04.374 --> 18:05.709
And I talked to him.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.002
Everything is okay.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.922
But I am concerned
about what you said to him.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.715
Are you having doubts about Kate?

18:11.799 --> 18:13.092
No. I love Kate.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.176
It's the curse!

18:14.259 --> 18:16.303
It's making everything go wrong.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.930
What curse?

18:18.013 --> 18:19.723
[groans] You and Kate saw each other,

18:19.807 --> 18:22.518
and now your wedding is ruined,
and it's all my fault.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.895
Lucky, that's just a superstition.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.314
And since when
did you start believing in those?

18:27.397 --> 18:30.943
I don't, but-- but the cart... smashed!

18:31.026 --> 18:33.946
And the arch fell, and that idiot donkey
ate the bouquet,

18:34.029 --> 18:35.948
and the cake is full of pies, and-- and--

18:36.031 --> 18:37.324
[laughs]

18:37.407 --> 18:39.952
Oh, that doesn't sound like a curse.

18:40.035 --> 18:43.747
That sounds like an average day
for my crazy girl Lucky.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.126
I guess, but I just want everything
to be perfect.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.752
It is perfect...

18:48.836 --> 18:50.546
no matter what goes wrong,

18:50.629 --> 18:53.966
because I'm with the two people
I love most in this world,

18:54.049 --> 18:57.845
and at the end of the day,
we're going to be a family.

18:59.054 --> 18:59.972
[bells tolling]

19:00.055 --> 19:02.349
[Cora] Jim! It's time to go!

19:02.432 --> 19:03.559
I still need to change.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.853
I'll meet you at the church
in a few minutes.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.191
[sighs]

19:12.442 --> 19:13.277
And, Dad?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.113
I love you.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.076
Well, now or never, old boy.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.495
Ready, Spirit?

19:25.873 --> 19:28.083
[neighing]

19:28.167 --> 19:31.003
Thanks, boy, but with this dress,
I think I'd better walk.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.629
[neighs]

19:32.713 --> 19:34.882
Yes, it's quite a lovely church.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.384
Quite small, though.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.598
Thanks for your help today, Spirit.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.475
You know, I think everything
is gonna be okay after all.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.560
[neighs]

19:46.643 --> 19:49.438
Yeah, take that, you dumb superstition.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.939
Come on, we better hurry.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.066
Hey!

19:53.150 --> 19:54.401
[neighs]

19:54.484 --> 19:56.028
-What's wrong?
-[snorts]

19:56.111 --> 19:58.405
-[neighs]
-Spirit! Let me by!

19:58.488 --> 19:59.364
I can't be late.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.366
[neighs]

20:01.450 --> 20:02.618
[snorts]

20:02.701 --> 20:04.036
Ugh, cut it out.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.914
Getting to the church on time
is the only thing I have to do!

20:06.997 --> 20:09.166
[snorting]

20:12.502 --> 20:13.921
[chuffs]

20:14.254 --> 20:16.673
[gasps] The rings! I forgot!

20:16.757 --> 20:17.633
Thanks, boy.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.176
I know right where they are...

20:19.259 --> 20:20.219
I think.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.305
Well, they're in one of six places,
but I'll find them.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.725
[bells tolling]

20:26.808 --> 20:29.603
[chattering]

20:29.686 --> 20:32.439
[snores]

20:32.522 --> 20:35.651
Huh? Oh? [yawns]

20:35.734 --> 20:38.403
[light organ music playing]

20:46.745 --> 20:48.664
Why am I not surprised?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.083
He can't make my trains run on time.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.418
Why should his wedding be any different?

20:54.336 --> 20:56.338
-[snoring]
-Hmm.

21:00.008 --> 21:00.884
Uh-oh.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.553
Uh... [chuckles, groans]

21:05.264 --> 21:06.473
-Wow.
-[Kate gasps]

21:06.556 --> 21:08.100
Not again!

21:08.183 --> 21:09.977
Can you be double-cursed?

21:10.060 --> 21:11.895
What lucky fella gets to marry you?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.105
[chuckles]

21:13.188 --> 21:16.900
I don't know, but if you see him,
can you tell him how great I look?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.486
If you are through cracking wise,

21:19.569 --> 21:21.697
may I ask what is holding things up
back here?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.699
Oh. Lucky's not here yet.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.409
Do you know where she is?

21:25.492 --> 21:26.702
Uh...

21:26.785 --> 21:30.706
We saw her speeding away in a wagon
screaming that the wedding was cursed.

21:30.789 --> 21:34.918
-Bu-- but I'm sure nothing is wrong.
-[both chuckle]

21:35.002 --> 21:38.297
Jim, you don't think
she had second thoughts?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.716
No, I just talked to her.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.593
She says she loves you, just like I do.

21:43.677 --> 21:44.636
She did?

21:45.387 --> 21:48.724
I'll go see what's holding her up,
and we'll get this show on the road.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.810
Nothing is gonna stop me
from marrying you today.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.938
Aw.

21:55.022 --> 21:55.939
[blows nose]

21:56.023 --> 21:57.482
-[Pru grunts]
-Aah!

21:58.400 --> 22:01.403
[neighing]

22:03.405 --> 22:05.157
Hey, boy, is Lucky inside?

22:05.240 --> 22:06.199
[neighing]

22:07.409 --> 22:10.412
Come on, Spirit. I gotta get Lucky. Huh?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.542
Lucky? Are you here?

22:15.625 --> 22:16.501
[rings clink]

22:16.585 --> 22:17.753
What in the world?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.963
-Lucky?
-Stop!

22:20.047 --> 22:21.340
Aah! What the--

22:21.423 --> 22:23.175
Hey! Get off of me!

22:23.258 --> 22:24.468
[grunts, gasps]

22:25.135 --> 22:26.762
-[Jim] Lucky!
-Dad! She found me!

22:26.845 --> 22:28.555
-She found me!
-Who?

22:28.638 --> 22:31.558
-Ah! Lucky-- Let me go!
-[Butch] Hold it right there.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.602
Who are you?
What are you doing with my daughter?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.353
Name's Butch LePray.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.564
And we've got some unfinished business.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.649
-No! [grunts]
-[Jim grunts]

22:39.733 --> 22:41.276
[Butch cackles]
