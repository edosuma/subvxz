WEBVTT

00:04.080 --> 00:06.340
Hey, this is a good box.

00:06.450 --> 00:08.600
We got a bloody foot on a hook...

00:09.680 --> 00:11.740
... and a dissected alien...

00:12.590 --> 00:14.750
... and some tax returns.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.290
Oooooh!

00:16.390 --> 00:19.219
The IRS believes we have a home office.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.799
- Oooooh!
- Oooooh!

00:21.800 --> 00:23.890
Oh, my God! You guys are
not gonna believe it!

00:24.000 --> 00:25.860
I passed my driving test!

00:25.970 --> 00:28.660
Apparently, it's "pass everyone" day.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.980
Come on. I'm not that bad a driver.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.030
I let you drive home,

00:32.040 --> 00:34.570
and you made a garbage truck swerve.

00:34.670 --> 00:35.950
You don't see something that big

00:35.980 --> 00:38.380
up on two wheels every day.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.100
It's like he was
stopping at every house.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.010
That's what they do!

00:45.280 --> 00:46.520
And then, to finish up,

00:46.550 --> 00:48.950
you dragged a traffic cone
most of the way home.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.440
Luckily, that kid's
skateboard broke it loose.

00:51.460 --> 00:52.590
I need a drink.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.490
Becky, where do you keep the hard stuff?

00:54.590 --> 00:55.790
In Becky.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.860
So, can I use Grandma's old car now?

00:59.970 --> 01:00.970
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.180
But not to drive.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.670
You can sit in it and play the radio

01:04.769 --> 01:06.370
and go, "Vroom, vroom!"

01:06.470 --> 01:09.510
Your imagination is a road to anywhere.

01:14.150 --> 01:16.780
Well, I really do need the job.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.750
And, boy, do I love housecleaning.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.720
It's topless?

01:21.820 --> 01:24.720
Well, that explains the $40 an hour.

01:24.820 --> 01:27.260
$40 an hour? Do they take men?

01:27.360 --> 01:29.380
'Cause I'll show off the girls for that.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.499
Um, I'm gonna have to pass.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.320
But I will give your
number to my sister.

01:34.420 --> 01:35.870
Thank you.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.890
All right, so, since I've
got you guys here together,

01:38.900 --> 01:40.940
I want to show you my costume.

01:42.260 --> 01:44.840
Disemboweled cheerleader.

01:44.940 --> 01:48.890
Ohhh! Look at you, all gory and sexy.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.800
Uh, I'm bringing a friend to the party,

01:50.860 --> 01:52.880
and it looks like it's
starting to be a thing,

01:52.990 --> 01:54.950
so I wanted to show off a little leg,

01:55.050 --> 01:56.220
a little intestine.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.680
Who's the lucky guy?

01:58.720 --> 02:00.060
His name's Peter.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.219
Oh! Peter!

02:03.220 --> 02:06.000
I want your opinion. I do
not want you teasing him.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.039
This family has a history of chasing off

02:08.060 --> 02:10.199
all the unstable men that
I bring into my life,

02:10.300 --> 02:12.740
but Peter's different.

02:12.820 --> 02:14.970
Oh! Peter!

02:15.070 --> 02:17.640
He's different!

02:17.740 --> 02:20.340
I'm serious... no teasing.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.026
Don't worry. We'll be good.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.720
Yeah, you haven't dated
anyone in, like, forever.

02:24.820 --> 02:27.470
We're not gonna mess with
whatever straggling animal

02:27.490 --> 02:29.350
you've picked off the back of the herd.

"The Conners" is recorded

03:09.280 --> 03:10.730
in front of a live studio audience.

03:10.830 --> 03:13.840
All right, everybody! Get in here!

03:13.880 --> 03:16.030
We got to get this photo in by 9:00.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.370
Napoleon Blown-Apart is 'ere...

03:23.980 --> 03:25.840
... at your service.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.280
So, what do we get if we
win this Instagram thing?

03:29.320 --> 03:31.720
The scariest family gets a case of beer

03:31.820 --> 03:33.740
and a 6-foot everything sub sandwich

03:33.760 --> 03:35.180
from Jack's Liquor & Deli.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.260
Ooh! La bibliothèque!

03:38.360 --> 03:41.560
Becky, um...

03:41.660 --> 03:44.520
not sure what's going
on here, but I love it!

03:45.330 --> 03:47.940
Sharknade... O'Conner.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.700
I nee... I need more than that.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.000
Sinéad O'Connor and "Sharknado."

03:56.040 --> 03:57.210
Ohhhh!

03:57.310 --> 04:00.040
Well, the important
thing is you had fun.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.280
Scary J. Blige, you're in the front.

04:04.380 --> 04:06.140
Show your fangs, sweetheart.

04:06.260 --> 04:07.640
I dropped them on the floor.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.220
Give me your fangs, sweetheart.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.040
Big game hunter, you're
behind the couch.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.520
Lizzie Boredom...

04:13.600 --> 04:16.220
sitting on the arm of the couch,

04:16.240 --> 04:17.490
staring at your phone.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.560
Really sell the boredom now.

04:19.670 --> 04:20.670
All right.

04:20.769 --> 04:22.470
Why don't you tell me about your day?

04:24.570 --> 04:25.900
Why aren't you in costume?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.820
Oh, I can't. I got a job
interview at McNasty's.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.740
That place where all the
waiters are rude to you?

04:31.840 --> 04:33.740
You are perfect for that.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.359
Mom!

04:35.360 --> 04:36.580
I just texted a picture

04:36.600 --> 04:38.580
of my Fortnite costume to Joey.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.420
He told me that since it's
based on a violent video game,

04:41.520 --> 04:43.920
they're not gonna let me
into the school carnival!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.419
Uh, okay, I'm sorry, honey.
I have to run.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.940
I promise you I will take care of this

04:47.990 --> 04:49.330
as soon as I get home.

04:49.430 --> 04:51.380
No! This is an emergency!

04:51.460 --> 04:52.976
They banned a whole bunch of costumes.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.700
You were supposed to get an e-mail.

04:54.740 --> 04:56.170
A-All right. Hold on.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.540
Oh. Damn it. Here it is.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.200
It was important. Don't
you check your e-mails?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.220
I-I missed it.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.439
It was hiding between
"Get in Shape Today"

05:06.440 --> 05:08.250
and "Your Breakfast May Be Killing You."

05:09.480 --> 05:10.740
Well, this is stupid.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.560
What kind of costumes are they banning?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.199
It says "No costumes

05:14.200 --> 05:16.789
that perpetuate negative
ethnic stereotypes

05:16.790 --> 05:20.110
or are scary, gory, or
anything that's saddening."

05:20.140 --> 05:21.160
Our whole family is saddening.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.460
Does that mean we can't go out anymore?

05:23.560 --> 05:25.440
It's Halloween for God's sake!

05:25.460 --> 05:28.200
24 hours without laws or rules!

05:29.320 --> 05:31.070
That's the "Purge" movies, Dad.

05:33.140 --> 05:35.140
Mom, this isn't fair.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.370
All right, well, don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.740
We still have two days to
come up with new costumes.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.880
None of us want to
offend anybody, right?

05:41.980 --> 05:44.310
It just has to be
something other than...

05:44.420 --> 05:48.020
a bandito, a geisha, zombie, ninja...

05:48.120 --> 05:51.620
Who's offended by a ninja costume?

05:51.720 --> 05:53.120
I've lived in Lanford my whole life

05:53.230 --> 05:56.100
and have yet to run into a ninja.

05:56.130 --> 05:57.630
Oh, they're out there.

05:59.530 --> 06:00.890
And by the time you do see them...

06:00.970 --> 06:02.500
pfft... it's too late.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.600
All right, uh, I got to go.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.410
Where are my damn keys?

06:08.510 --> 06:11.440
Look, Mark's your kid, but I know

06:11.460 --> 06:13.880
your mom and I would've fought
this thing tooth and nail.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.020
Look, I don't want to get
into it with these people.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.279
I already owe them money
for Mark's field trip

06:18.280 --> 06:20.050
to the dairy farm to
see how milk is made.

06:21.350 --> 06:22.670
Chinese kids are building robots.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.989
Our kids are confused
about what cows do.

06:24.990 --> 06:26.020
Wow.

06:27.190 --> 06:29.460
Look, if you don't want a
problem with the school,

06:29.480 --> 06:30.730
that's one thing,

06:30.830 --> 06:33.700
but tell your son this
is a bunch of P.C. crap.

06:33.820 --> 06:35.499
He ought to be able to
wear whatever he wants.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.520
At least this way, he'll know
he didn't do anything wrong.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.800
I know that you and Mom felt
that way, but maybe I don't.

06:40.910 --> 06:42.410
Some stuff does cross the line,

06:42.510 --> 06:45.340
and Mark will be completely
fine in a different costume.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.510
Now, I hate to be rude,

06:46.610 --> 06:48.910
but I have to go someplace and be rude.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.410
So, the food is good,

06:53.420 --> 06:56.280
the benefits are great,
and you eat free.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.919
But, you see, what makes us different

06:57.920 --> 07:00.990
is our servers make
fun of our customers.

07:01.140 --> 07:03.210
People come here just to get picked on.

07:03.310 --> 07:05.910
Oh. Well, that's
something I enjoy doing.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.779
Just ask my kids.

07:07.780 --> 07:11.050
Well, and I see you have serving
experience at the casino,

07:11.150 --> 07:13.420
and everything looks good, so, uh...

07:13.520 --> 07:15.290
let's see you insult me.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.750
Oh. Um... okay.

07:17.860 --> 07:20.089
Maybe... you should try
to order something.

07:20.090 --> 07:21.689
I think I can work with that.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.000
I'll have the tuna melt.

07:23.930 --> 07:25.960
O... kay. Uh, okay. Uh...

07:26.060 --> 07:28.930
Ours is mostly dolphin and sea trash.

07:30.460 --> 07:33.270
Don't insult the food.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.500
Insult the customers.

07:34.610 --> 07:36.140
Oh, sorry.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.830
Now, come on. Let me
have it here. Come on.

07:38.930 --> 07:41.190
I came here to be insulted.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.360
I love it!

07:42.460 --> 07:44.870
Uh, this is a little
harder than I thought.

07:44.970 --> 07:46.370
I've never had to do it on command.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.500
Yeah, yeah, but, you know,

07:47.600 --> 07:49.116
just go with the flow,
you know what I mean?

07:49.140 --> 07:50.870
If you want, you could take your cues

07:50.970 --> 07:53.710
off my appearance or
something I'm wearing.

07:53.810 --> 07:55.680
Okay. Um...

07:55.780 --> 07:57.410
Bet when you were a kid,

07:57.510 --> 07:59.550
you thought you were gonna
grow up and be something,

07:59.620 --> 08:02.250
but you went and disappointed
everyone, didn't you, Gary?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.250
You're a little man in a big chair,

08:07.300 --> 08:09.359
and you're gonna spend the
rest of your life alone.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.760
Look at you!

08:13.460 --> 08:16.030
I'm not sure people
are gonna enjoy that.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.200
Oh. Am I missing something? I
thought it was pretty rude.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.970
Well, you see, there's rude,

08:22.070 --> 08:24.400
and then there's McNasty's fun rude.

08:24.410 --> 08:26.500
You know, everything all in fun.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.010
We're looking for something more like...

08:30.110 --> 08:31.950
"You call that a hat?"

08:33.549 --> 08:34.950
Ohhh! Okay.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.720
I-I get it now. I get it.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.549
Um, nice hat. Uh...

08:39.659 --> 08:41.590
Maybe you should pull it
down over your ugly face

08:41.690 --> 08:43.520
so people can keep their burgers down.

08:43.630 --> 08:44.720
Huh?

08:44.770 --> 08:46.110
Okay. Okay. You know what?

08:46.130 --> 08:48.430
I-I think that's enough for today.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.300
And, uh, we'll call you.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.590
Thank you. I really
appreciate your time.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.770
I need this job pretty bad,
and I know I can do it...

08:55.870 --> 08:57.140
Butt Face.

08:58.970 --> 09:00.840
It's not gonna happen.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.080
Just go.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.780
And my mother says I'm amazing!

09:10.000 --> 09:11.560
When do you start at McNasty's?

09:11.640 --> 09:12.960
I didn't get it.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.240
You didn't get a job insulting people?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.090
I was overqualified.

09:19.930 --> 09:22.460
All right, I know you're nervous
about letting me drive,

09:22.560 --> 09:23.930
but think about the benefits.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.380
Like, when one of you guys are drunk,

09:25.400 --> 09:27.930
I can come and pick you
up... no questions asked.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.080
Of course, the next day, we
will have a conversation

09:30.110 --> 09:31.920
about choices, but...

09:32.040 --> 09:34.740
Well, if it's okay with your
mom, it's okay with me.

09:34.820 --> 09:37.240
Mom, can I drive Grandma's old car?

09:37.350 --> 09:39.680
Oh, if it's okay with
Grandpa, it's okay with me.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.410
Grandpa?

09:41.520 --> 09:43.380
She says "Okay," I'm okay.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.440
But she's just gonna tell
me to come back to you.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.840
Yeah.

09:47.900 --> 09:51.120
It's been our experience that
kids tire out eventually.

09:51.620 --> 09:52.740
Mom?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.900
I'm in the kitchen. We got to get going.

09:54.930 --> 09:56.450
The carnival starts in a half an hour.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.100
Are you done with your new costume?

09:58.200 --> 10:02.880
Yep. Presenting one of the great
artists of the 20th century...

10:08.240 --> 10:11.310
I can't believe you
made that in two days!

10:11.410 --> 10:12.850
Frida Kahlo... you look just like

10:12.950 --> 10:14.450
that famous painting of her.

10:14.550 --> 10:16.750
Yeah, you got a mustache...

10:16.850 --> 10:19.400
and one up top there as a backup.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.120
I just really like her style.

10:22.220 --> 10:25.100
She was in that art book Mom
stole for me from the library.

10:26.290 --> 10:27.950
It was an art book in Lanford.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.660
Nobody'll even know it's missing.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.610
Hello.

10:32.620 --> 10:33.716
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.360
- Hey!
- Do not fear.

10:35.370 --> 10:37.640
It is not the real Invisible Man.

10:37.740 --> 10:39.300
It is my son, Kazim.

10:39.980 --> 10:42.579
I don't see anybody. Where is he?

10:42.580 --> 10:43.760
I'm right here.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.310
I hear him, but I can't see him.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.180
Can I go inside now?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.890
You could already be
inside, for all I know.

10:53.690 --> 10:56.060
Thank you for inviting
us over for Halloween.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.460
We weren't so thrilled about Halloween

10:58.560 --> 11:01.760
because last year, you
people vandalized us.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.630
We did that to everybody.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.890
Well, yeah, we talked about
not doing your house,

11:06.940 --> 11:09.240
but we thought you might
feel discriminated against.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.370
♪ Toasted eyeballs drenched in... ♪

11:12.470 --> 11:14.370
So, Dan, I would like to introduce you

11:14.480 --> 11:16.120
to my new friend, Peter.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.580
Hey, man. Nice to meet you.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.210
Great... Two-Face costume.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.750
Oh, good to meet you, too.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.700
But, uh, tonight, I'm actually dressed

11:24.720 --> 11:27.290
as the mind/body dualism of Descartes.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.689
I've often ordered des carte.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.490
But, of course, you know,
it's more expensive that way.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.600
What?

11:37.840 --> 11:39.230
Dan, when you invited me,

11:39.270 --> 11:42.300
I dialed up a couple of fun
facts about Halloween,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.420
so hold on to your bicorn hat.

11:45.710 --> 11:47.520
More about that later.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.900
Did you know that Halloween came

11:49.910 --> 11:53.140
from the Celtic festival of Samhain?

11:53.820 --> 11:56.780
I heard that, but I didn't believe it.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.750
Right? It marked the end of the summer

11:58.850 --> 12:01.090
and the beginning of
the dark, cold winter,

12:01.190 --> 12:02.960
which they associated with death...

12:03.060 --> 12:05.560
ergo, ghosts and goblins.

12:05.660 --> 12:07.790
I'll be darned.

12:07.900 --> 12:10.500
Well, we got jello with
eyeballs in the fridge

12:10.520 --> 12:11.530
and beer if you want it.

12:11.550 --> 12:14.300
And Peter has a master's
in medieval culture,

12:14.400 --> 12:15.570
among other things.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.080
Tell him the best part, honey.

12:17.140 --> 12:19.440
Oh, it gets better, honey?

12:19.660 --> 12:22.440
Repeating a word that was
said before... funny.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.549
But the best part is
that the Celts believed

12:26.550 --> 12:28.980
that the boundaries between
the world of the living

12:29.080 --> 12:31.850
and of the dead were
blurred on that day,

12:31.950 --> 12:34.390
so they wore costumes
to fool the demons,

12:34.490 --> 12:36.560
thus avoiding being dragged to Hell.

12:36.660 --> 12:40.290
Amazing. I could listen to
this man talk for hours.

12:40.350 --> 12:41.930
And I could let you.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.700
There's got to be kids at the door.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.630
Maybe the bell's on the fritz.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.970
Uh, sorry. I might be boring you.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.240
I guess you're more of
a... a football guy.

12:53.510 --> 12:56.060
Yeah, that's me... Joe Lunchpail.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.710
I read a book once, but
it was a comic book.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.560
I finished 'er, though.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.050
Comic books have a very storied history.

13:05.070 --> 13:08.120
Many of the archetypes come
from Anglo-Saxon myth,

13:08.140 --> 13:09.490
particularly Beowulf.

13:09.570 --> 13:12.390
I've heard this story,
but you know who hasn't?

13:12.490 --> 13:13.640
Becky.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.460
Ah. And what are you?

13:23.540 --> 13:26.440
I'm poor, back when poor was funny.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.840
Hey! Look at you!

13:30.550 --> 13:32.190
Listen, we love having
Mark at the school,

13:32.210 --> 13:34.100
but he can't come in wearing that.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.360
Why not?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.599
Your son dressed as Frida Kahlo

13:37.600 --> 13:39.519
could be perceived as offensive.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.166
Didn't you get the
e-mail three months ago?

13:41.190 --> 13:43.220
Three months?!

13:43.280 --> 13:44.330
Listen, I just found out

13:44.350 --> 13:45.770
I haven't had a mammogram in five years.

13:45.790 --> 13:46.800
I'm a little behind.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.520
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Swindell.

13:52.550 --> 13:54.660
What exactly is the
problem with his costume?

13:54.690 --> 13:56.890
He is dressed as an Hispanic woman.

13:56.990 --> 13:59.260
That falls under cultural appropriation.

13:59.330 --> 14:02.660
No, it's cultural appreciation.
He loves Frida Kahlo.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.560
The guidelines were clear.

14:04.660 --> 14:05.990
He has not experienced

14:06.000 --> 14:08.800
what a person of that
ethnicity has experienced.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.940
Therefore, he does not have
a legitimate entitlement

14:11.000 --> 14:14.410
to use or wear any element
of their ethnic identity.

14:14.510 --> 14:17.440
Could you just let the
grapes go by, please?

14:17.540 --> 14:20.200
That's not a comment on
migrant workers, is it?

14:20.750 --> 14:22.510
All right, go ahead. Go ahead. Thanks.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.400
Now, please, I don't want
Mark to miss the carnival.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.890
Just lose the costume.
You can come right in.

14:28.990 --> 14:30.620
I worked hard on this costume.

14:30.650 --> 14:33.190
I made it especially for this carnival.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.290
Can't I please come in?

14:35.390 --> 14:38.000
Listen, I get what the
rule is for. I really do.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.900
But sometimes the good
intention of the rule

14:39.930 --> 14:42.170
gets taken a little
far, don't you think?

14:42.270 --> 14:44.670
Why don't you grow a
pair, Mr. Swine-dell?

14:44.770 --> 14:47.440
That's right... I came up with
that nickname 30 years ago.

14:47.540 --> 14:50.220
And start judging Mark
on an individual basis,

14:50.240 --> 14:54.140
instead of lumping him into
some category on a list.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.810
Okay, we just want to go
in there and spend $10...

14:56.920 --> 14:59.000
which I do not have... on the ring toss

14:59.020 --> 15:01.680
so I can win a goldfish
that will die in my car!

15:02.080 --> 15:04.040
Or we can stand here

15:04.060 --> 15:06.060
and continue traumatizing my child,

15:06.160 --> 15:08.800
which I know I'm not
helping by yelling at you!

15:09.480 --> 15:12.420
I know about the nickname, Dark-lene.

15:13.630 --> 15:15.850
But I'm sorry. Rules are rules.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.570
And by the way, don't you still
owe us money for the field trip?

15:18.670 --> 15:20.750
Uh, yes, I do, and I will get it to you

15:20.770 --> 15:21.970
as soon as I get a second job.

15:22.070 --> 15:24.780
Apparently, I'm not rude
in an entertaining way.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.960
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
ahead and agree with that.

15:29.620 --> 15:30.950
God.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.470
I'm sorry I yelled at your principal.

15:35.490 --> 15:38.160
I mean, that is not the kind of
example I want to set for you.

15:38.260 --> 15:41.390
No. That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

15:41.490 --> 15:43.859
From now on, nobody's
gonna bully the kid

15:43.860 --> 15:46.400
with the psycho mom wearing a barrel.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.150
Well, we stood up for our principles,

15:48.180 --> 15:49.379
and we did the right thing,

15:49.380 --> 15:50.980
and so we should be proud of that.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.300
Now let's go find some
tall grass so I can pee.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.400
Aww! Aren't you a cute princess.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.780
Trick or Treat!

16:03.880 --> 16:05.220
Uh-oh.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.940
I see you have a king-size candy bar.

16:08.990 --> 16:10.500
Caught this just in time.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.360
These are full of cooties.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.620
I'll throw that out for you.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.600
And I'll give you two candy corns...

16:20.630 --> 16:24.230
and a popcorn ball we
found on the couch.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.620
Happy Halloween!

16:25.670 --> 16:27.200
She's adorable!

16:31.080 --> 16:32.640
You should be ashamed of yourself,

16:32.750 --> 16:34.680
taking candy from a child...

16:34.780 --> 16:36.450
and not giving me half.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.680
Here you go.

16:39.690 --> 16:42.950
I think you'll find the
shame makes it delicious.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.260
Hey, Grandpa.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.140
- Is this about the car again?
- No.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.470
I just wanted to let you know

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
that I've been offered a
job at the Dairy Queen.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.900
Good for you.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.080
But how will I get there, you ask.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.230
I don't really care.

16:57.340 --> 16:59.940
Well, since you brought up the
car, let's talk about it.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.810
I can pay for insurance and gas.

17:01.910 --> 17:03.040
And I just have to say,

17:03.080 --> 17:04.819
you have the hair of
a man half your age.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.380
All right, stop.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.680
Here's the deal.

17:07.780 --> 17:09.420
You're gonna drive me
to work for a month,

17:09.440 --> 17:12.720
with me screaming in
your face every day.

17:12.819 --> 17:15.390
When I'm sure you're
not gonna hurt anyone,

17:15.490 --> 17:16.650
you can use the car.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.760
Yes! Thank you!

17:17.790 --> 17:20.119
I will do my best not to kill you.

17:22.730 --> 17:24.300
Why are you being so hard on her?

17:24.329 --> 17:25.980
I don't want her wrecking the car.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.128
Why are you worried? Just
put her on your insurance.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.330
I'm on there.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.440
Yeah, sure you are.

17:37.210 --> 17:38.909
- Well?
- "Well" what?

17:38.910 --> 17:40.960
Come on. Come on. What do
you think about Peter?

17:40.980 --> 17:42.760
- He's nice.
- Nice?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.680
That's it?

17:44.780 --> 17:46.990
Before, I had my sister
around to vet my boyfriends

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
and tell me if I was
making a huge mistake.

17:49.020 --> 17:51.920
Can you do a little of
that... just be honest?

17:52.080 --> 17:55.140
Well, he does seem to know a lot,

17:55.180 --> 17:56.990
and he's not shy about sharing it.

17:57.100 --> 18:00.020
Okay. That's fair. What else?

18:00.100 --> 18:02.640
Uh, well, he... he's the kind of guy

18:02.660 --> 18:04.680
that even though you haven't
spent much time with him,

18:04.700 --> 18:06.596
it feels like you've spent
a lot of time with him.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.710
Sure. Sure.

18:08.810 --> 18:11.539
That's it, though?
Th-That's all you got?

18:11.540 --> 18:12.880
I just want you to be honest.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.410
Really dig deep, really find some flaws.

18:15.510 --> 18:16.830
Roseanne would tell me how she felt,

18:16.850 --> 18:19.100
and I'd blow up at her for meddling,

18:19.120 --> 18:20.480
but I'd hear it.

18:21.690 --> 18:24.390
I get it. Um, all right.

18:24.490 --> 18:26.780
Uh, I'm new at this, but here it goes.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.130
Uh, I-I think I might hate him,

18:29.230 --> 18:30.860
but I really need more time.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.360
See?

18:32.460 --> 18:34.230
That's a different perspective.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.560
Thank you.

18:35.660 --> 18:36.680
It is a little weird

18:36.700 --> 18:39.140
that Peter doesn't have
a job at 48 years old.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.140
I knew you'd try and destroy this.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.470
I don't know why I bother

18:44.480 --> 18:46.200
talking to anybody in this family.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.810
And by the way, do you
know how hard it is

18:48.910 --> 18:52.200
to find a single guy in
his 40s with a job?!

18:52.550 --> 18:55.090
He's a damn unicorn!

18:55.190 --> 18:56.940
That's what he is!

19:00.580 --> 19:01.600
Hey, Grandpa.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.490
Hey. How was the carnival?

19:03.500 --> 19:04.730
We didn't go.

19:04.830 --> 19:07.140
Mark and I wandered around
the creepy cemetery

19:07.170 --> 19:09.030
behind the old Lanford church.

19:09.130 --> 19:10.900
We found all these tombstones

19:11.000 --> 19:14.140
with Hortenses and
Ebenezers and Obediahs.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.360
How come they only lived
'til they were 40?

19:16.400 --> 19:19.580
Well, when people are constantly
making fun of your name,

19:19.680 --> 19:21.780
it's just too painful to go on.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.140
So, why'd you skip the carnival?

19:25.200 --> 19:26.820
They said I couldn't be Frida Kahlo

19:26.880 --> 19:28.260
because I'm not Mexican.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.720
And?

19:29.920 --> 19:32.180
Mom went crazy on the principal.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.160
- You really went after him, huh?
- I did.

19:35.390 --> 19:36.780
Way to go, Dark-lene.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.580
Look, you were still mostly wrong,

19:40.600 --> 19:42.500
but this guy was mostly wrong, too.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.800
So what have we learned? Men are wrong.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.500
Um, Mom, I'm a man.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.070
Yes, you are, son.

19:49.170 --> 19:50.940
Welcome to Wrong Island.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.090
Anyway, way to go,

19:54.100 --> 19:56.080
