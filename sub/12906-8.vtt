00:00.501 --> 00:02.033
<i>Previously on "Devious Maids"...</i>

00:02.035 --> 00:04.666
- I know you're my mother now.
- I can't be that for you.

00:04.701 --> 00:05.895
How long you plan on being away?

00:05.897 --> 00:08.826
There's one thing that I have to do.
I'm gonna find my real dad.

00:08.861 --> 00:12.026
Peter. Husband number three...
the one who got away.

00:12.028 --> 00:14.361
You humiliated me in front of
those horrible men.

00:14.363 --> 00:15.796
- It's work.
- And work takes priority.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.364
I'm starting to get that. [Scoffs]

00:17.366 --> 00:19.266
It's good that you're going.
I need some time.

00:19.268 --> 00:22.770
You're this hot, intelligent,
successful woman.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.305
Why would you want to be with a
guy like me?

00:24.307 --> 00:27.608
Fashion exec just bought this place.
She's gonna be gone for six months.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.211
This really cute guy came over
and assumed I owned the house.

00:30.213 --> 00:32.046
I broke up with my mother, so
can I stay here?

00:32.048 --> 00:34.548
- With me?
- I don't have anywhere else to go.

00:34.550 --> 00:38.252
I'm barely used to hanging out with you.
Can we agree to never talk about sex?

00:39.655 --> 00:41.488
That feels nice!

00:41.490 --> 00:43.791
I'm so glad you like it. [Gasps]

00:43.793 --> 00:46.493
Spence Westmore, you're under arrest
for the murder of Peri Westmore.

00:46.495 --> 00:47.962
No, no, he didn't do it!

00:47.964 --> 00:50.130
[Crying] I'm Shannon. I'm Peri's sister.

00:50.132 --> 00:51.932
And she doesn't know
anything about The Circle?

00:51.934 --> 00:53.234
She doesn't have a clue.

00:53.236 --> 00:56.804
There's this bad man named Ben.
Maybe he's got someone spying on me.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.939
I was thinking, if I follow
Miss Shannon,

00:58.941 --> 01:01.442
I can find out where The Circle
meets.

01:01.444 --> 01:04.311
Someone's going around
asking about Peri's murder.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.746
What's in this? [Coughs]

01:05.748 --> 01:07.948
Tucker Westmore is the key to
everything.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.950
<i>That Spence isn't Tucker's father?</i>

01:09.952 --> 01:11.185
You didn't hear that from me.

01:11.187 --> 01:12.353
I'm leaving you.

01:12.355 --> 01:16.090
If it appears to the court like
you're the one who abandoned your home,

01:16.092 --> 01:18.025
it may negatively impact your
settlement.

01:18.027 --> 01:19.827
All I need is the new passcode
for the gate.

01:19.829 --> 01:20.961
That's pretty.

01:20.963 --> 01:22.329
My necklace?

01:22.331 --> 01:25.961
- Evelyn? How did you get in?
- Oh, I hope you don't mind,

01:25.963 --> 01:28.631
but James will be spending the
night here.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.335
You know, this would go a lot
faster if you just helped me.

01:33.337 --> 01:36.305
Push with your legs. See?
Helping.

01:36.808 --> 01:40.343
I'm sure I'll regret asking,
but what's all this about?

01:40.345 --> 01:42.646
I'm dividing the house in half.

01:42.648 --> 01:43.980
Now that I'm back,

01:43.982 --> 01:45.782
establishing distinct personal
spheres

01:45.784 --> 01:48.451
seems the best way to avoid
each other until it's all final.

01:48.453 --> 01:51.688
I see. And which side of Berlin
do you intend to live in?

01:51.690 --> 01:53.890
I'll take the West wing, you the East,

01:53.892 --> 01:56.860
and the study shall be divided
fairly down the middle.

01:56.862 --> 01:59.863
I still don't understand
how you got back in here.

01:59.865 --> 02:01.498
How did you get past the gate?

02:01.500 --> 02:02.565
I changed the code.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.367
She climbed over the fence.

02:04.369 --> 02:05.869
I'd sooner believe she jumped the fence

02:05.871 --> 02:07.237
on a red-white-and-blue
motorcycle.

02:07.239 --> 02:08.705
[Cellphone vibrates]

02:08.707 --> 02:12.642
[Laughs]

02:12.644 --> 02:14.744
I'm sorry. It's... It's
just a text from James,

02:14.746 --> 02:16.212
the reverend.

02:16.214 --> 02:18.815
- My boyfriend.
- I'm getting a drink.

02:18.817 --> 02:20.517
Nah, unh-unh!
You stay on your side.

02:20.519 --> 02:23.186
You must be joking.

02:23.188 --> 02:24.421
I am not.

02:24.423 --> 02:27.023
You may not travel past the Cézanne
without risking life and limb.

02:27.025 --> 02:28.525
Moreover, we will not speak

02:28.527 --> 02:29.859
to each other directly...

02:29.861 --> 02:31.227
only through Carmen.

02:31.229 --> 02:33.363
So, we're gonna run our conversations

02:33.365 --> 02:36.366
through Carmen and her
English-language meat grinder?

02:36.368 --> 02:37.667
Dude, I'm standing right here.

02:37.669 --> 02:39.736
Didn't understand a word of that.

02:39.738 --> 02:41.438
Evelyn, the bar is on your side.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.206
What do I do when I need a drink?

02:43.208 --> 02:44.841
Carmen. [Snaps fingers]
Please answer.

02:44.843 --> 02:47.510
We made you a nice bar over there.

02:50.882 --> 02:52.682
Carmen, please tell Evelyn

02:52.684 --> 02:55.852
that she cannot hold my best
bourbon hostage.

02:55.854 --> 02:58.388
Carmen, tell Adrian I will do
whatever the hell I please.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.480
She's lucky I haven't already
called the police...

03:00.482 --> 03:04.027
- I'll have him brought up on charges...
- Bah!

03:04.029 --> 03:05.395
Mr. Powell says I get a raise.

03:05.397 --> 03:07.731
Mrs. Powell says it's time for a break.

03:07.733 --> 03:09.799
Bye-bye.

03:15.281 --> 03:17.636
<b>- sync and corrections by Zac -
- www.addic7ed.com -</b>

03:21.313 --> 03:24.814
Wait. You think Kyle and
Frances are in a cult?

03:24.816 --> 03:26.883
I followed Miss Shannon to
their house,

03:26.885 --> 03:29.719
and you always said there was
something weird about them.

03:29.721 --> 03:31.488
Look, I know Kyle pretty well,

03:31.490 --> 03:33.656
and if he were in a cult,
I would know.

03:33.858 --> 03:36.793
Like he knows you're a maid
pretending to be rich?

03:36.795 --> 03:39.996
I'm just saying he could be dangerous.

03:39.998 --> 03:41.531
You shouldn't be dating him.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.299
I'm one step ahead of you.

03:43.301 --> 03:46.436
- I'm so ready to break up with him.
- Really?

03:46.438 --> 03:49.439
Have you ever been in bed with
a super-hot guy

03:49.441 --> 03:52.308
but find yourself thinking
about an...

03:52.310 --> 03:54.944
older, balder...

03:54.946 --> 03:56.679
plumper gentleman?

03:56.681 --> 03:58.214
Aye.

03:58.216 --> 04:01.618
Who is this gross old man
you're fantasizing about?

04:01.620 --> 04:03.853
Nobody. And it wasn't a fantasy.

04:03.855 --> 04:06.189
It was more like a terrifying
nightmare

04:06.191 --> 04:07.724
that will haunt me forever.

04:07.726 --> 04:10.293
Hey, girls.
What did we miss?

04:10.295 --> 04:11.828
Nothing.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.563
Rosie was just filling me in on
Peri's murder.

04:13.565 --> 04:16.366
I found out what Peri was hiding,

04:16.368 --> 04:19.802
and it's big enough that someone
might have killed her for it.

04:19.803 --> 04:21.404
Sounds like you're getting close.

04:21.406 --> 04:22.639
Spence must be happy.

04:22.641 --> 04:25.908
Not after he hears the secret.
He's not Tucker's father.

04:25.910 --> 04:27.810
- [Gasps] <i>Santo Dios</i>.
- Oh, my God.

04:27.812 --> 04:29.412
You can't tell him that.

04:29.414 --> 04:30.713
Rosie, are you sure?

04:30.715 --> 04:32.849
They did a blood test at the
hospital.

04:32.851 --> 04:34.484
Spence is not the father.

04:34.486 --> 04:36.853
[Laughing] Wow! It's like
an episode of "Maury"

04:36.855 --> 04:38.655
right here at this table.

04:39.891 --> 04:41.491
B-But it's sad.

04:41.493 --> 04:43.726
Poor Spence.

04:43.728 --> 04:47.730
I think Tucker's real father killed Peri
to keep this from coming out,

04:47.732 --> 04:50.199
and maybe Spence knows who she
cheated with.

04:50.201 --> 04:51.834
I have to ask him.

04:51.836 --> 04:53.736
Aw, but you'll break his heart.

04:53.738 --> 04:57.407
Aye. After everything he's been through,
now to find this out?

04:57.409 --> 04:58.775
Mm.

04:58.777 --> 05:00.576
Rosie, I wouldn't want
to be in your shoes.

05:00.578 --> 05:05.014
Or Marisol's.
Those are just... ugly.

05:07.452 --> 05:08.618
I know you said Ben is out of town,

05:08.620 --> 05:10.219
but when is he coming back?

05:10.221 --> 05:13.523
His work in Kuala Lumpur is
going better than expected,

05:13.525 --> 05:15.525
so I've ordered him to stay...

05:15.527 --> 05:17.193
permanently.

05:17.195 --> 05:19.028
But Ben is my manager.

05:19.933 --> 05:24.600
- How is he gonna manage me from there?
- His work is wherever I say it is.

05:24.602 --> 05:26.602
And Ben is a loyal follower

05:26.604 --> 05:29.105
who doesn't ask questions of me.

05:29.107 --> 05:32.909
But Ben promised The Circle
would make me a star just like Peri.

05:32.911 --> 05:35.378
And we will, even without him.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.580
We're very well connected.

05:37.582 --> 05:41.984
When Peri was killed,
you said Spence did it,

05:41.986 --> 05:43.886
and I never questioned that.

05:43.888 --> 05:45.555
Well, that's the truth.

05:45.557 --> 05:49.459
Shannon, what are you getting at?

05:49.461 --> 05:52.562
Just that I've been very
loyal to The Circle,

05:52.564 --> 05:55.264
but my loyalty comes with
expectations.

05:55.266 --> 05:57.166
I understand.

05:57.168 --> 06:00.603
I assure you you're
gonna be a bigger star

06:00.605 --> 06:05.141
than Peri ever was, and
that's a solemn promise.

06:05.143 --> 06:07.343
Really?

06:07.345 --> 06:09.445
Have faith, my child.

06:09.447 --> 06:12.081
All in due time.

06:17.489 --> 06:19.322
Hi.

06:19.324 --> 06:21.457
You left something at my house
the other night.

06:21.459 --> 06:24.427
Really? Come in. What'd I leave?

06:24.429 --> 06:25.762
[Door closes]

06:25.764 --> 06:27.096
Oh!

06:27.098 --> 06:28.831
That's where those were! Ha!

06:28.833 --> 06:31.100
How do you leave without noticing
you're not wearing underwear?

06:31.102 --> 06:33.369
I guess my...

06:33.371 --> 06:34.771
mind was on other things.

06:34.773 --> 06:37.106
[Sighs] No. Jesse.

06:39.010 --> 06:41.477
We can't do this again.

06:41.479 --> 06:43.112
Why not?

06:43.114 --> 06:45.948
Come on.

06:45.950 --> 06:47.283
Look.

06:47.285 --> 06:49.152
What happened between us was a
mistake.

06:49.154 --> 06:50.720
Peter's coming back tomorrow,

06:50.722 --> 06:52.789
and... and I need to figure out
where we stand.

06:52.791 --> 06:54.524
I thought you were in a fight
with him.

06:54.526 --> 06:55.691
I am.

06:55.693 --> 06:57.727
But we didn't break up exactly.

06:57.729 --> 06:59.362
We...

06:59.364 --> 07:01.197
Jesse.

07:01.199 --> 07:02.298
What?

07:02.300 --> 07:04.467
This is wrong.

07:04.469 --> 07:06.469
We've already done this once before.

07:06.471 --> 07:08.671
Is it that much worse if we do
it again?

07:08.673 --> 07:11.207
I doubt Peter will see it that way.

07:11.209 --> 07:13.075
Well, maybe he shouldn't have
fired you off of your own movie.

07:13.077 --> 07:16.345
That's a... good point.

07:16.347 --> 07:20.650
And wasn't he always prioritizing work
over your relationship?

07:20.652 --> 07:22.285
Um...

07:24.322 --> 07:26.322
Very true.

07:26.324 --> 07:28.925
For all you know,

07:28.927 --> 07:32.528
he could be planning to break
up with you...

07:32.530 --> 07:34.764
and you'll have missed out...

07:34.766 --> 07:36.666
on this...

07:40.004 --> 07:41.103
for nothing.

07:41.105 --> 07:42.572
Mm.

07:42.574 --> 07:46.175
You make a very compelling argument.

07:52.250 --> 07:55.084
Oh, good. You're here.

07:55.086 --> 07:56.686
Can we talk?

07:56.688 --> 07:59.355
Sure. Hey, who's Fiona Gladhart?

07:59.357 --> 08:01.557
- Sorry?
- I grabbed your mail.

08:01.559 --> 08:03.726
Lot of people seem to think she
lives here.

08:03.728 --> 08:05.561
Weird, huh?

08:05.563 --> 08:08.898
Anyway, we should talk.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.066
About?

08:10.068 --> 08:13.870
Well, I think you're great.

08:13.872 --> 08:17.240
But things between us moved a
little too quickly.

08:17.242 --> 08:18.908
I mean, we started dating,

08:18.910 --> 08:21.477
and then... bam!... living
together.

08:21.479 --> 08:23.045
[Chuckling] Well, we
didn't have a choice

08:23.047 --> 08:24.280
when I broke up with my mother.

08:24.282 --> 08:26.983
You got to stop saying it like that.

08:26.985 --> 08:28.985
The point is...

08:28.987 --> 08:32.989
I'm just not feeling the
romance between us anymore.

08:32.991 --> 08:37.159
I totally hear you, and I agree.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.126
- You do?
- Yes.

08:38.129 --> 08:39.895
Oh!

08:39.898 --> 08:41.964
Just because I live here,
I can't take you for granted.

08:41.966 --> 08:44.467
That's not exactly what I meant.

08:44.469 --> 08:48.804
No. You deserve romance.
I got to step up my game.

08:48.806 --> 08:52.975
Dinners, bubble baths, flowers...
whatever it takes to make you happy.

08:52.977 --> 08:54.143
You don't have to do that.

08:54.145 --> 08:55.811
Yes, I do.

08:55.813 --> 08:58.247
With everything going on
between my mother and me,

08:58.249 --> 09:00.483
last thing I want is for you to
break up with me.

09:00.485 --> 09:01.784
[Chuckles]

09:01.786 --> 09:03.619
[Mumbling] Oh, God.
[Giggles uneasily]

09:08.793 --> 09:10.793
[Rapid knock on door]

09:10.795 --> 09:14.030
Oh, hello, Mr. Powell.
Is everything okay?

09:14.032 --> 09:15.831
No, Carmen, it is not.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.502
I finally figured out how Evelyn
got on the property that night.

09:19.504 --> 09:21.370
I played back the security footage.

09:21.372 --> 09:23.739
She and that reverend just
pulled up to the gate,

09:23.741 --> 09:26.876
punched in the code,
and drove right in.

09:26.878 --> 09:29.044
Well, mystery solved!

09:29.046 --> 09:30.079
Goodbye.

09:30.081 --> 09:34.316
Now, where do you suppose
Evelyn got the gate code?

09:34.318 --> 09:36.552
Maybe from one of the gardeners?

09:36.554 --> 09:40.156
That's a lovely necklace.

09:41.592 --> 09:43.492
You know, Evelyn has the exact
same one.

09:43.494 --> 09:45.427
She does?

09:45.429 --> 09:47.530
Why do you have Evelyn's necklace?

09:47.532 --> 09:49.398
I stole it.

09:50.768 --> 09:52.434
Okay, fine.

09:52.436 --> 09:54.703
Mrs. Powell tricked me into
giving her the gate code.

09:54.705 --> 09:55.938
She tricked you? How?

09:55.940 --> 09:58.507
Well, by asking me for it
and then offering me nice things.

09:58.509 --> 09:59.909
Carmen!

09:59.911 --> 10:02.511
All this time, I thought you
were on Team Adrian.

10:02.513 --> 10:04.747
I am!

10:04.749 --> 10:07.183
Look, you wanted Mrs. Powell to
move back in to the house,

10:07.185 --> 10:08.551
and she came back, so you win!

10:08.553 --> 10:12.354
I wanted her to come back broken
with her tail between her legs.

10:12.356 --> 10:14.957
Instead, she comes back triumphant

10:14.959 --> 10:17.193
with a handsome black man
between her legs.

10:17.195 --> 10:18.627
I'm sorry.

10:18.629 --> 10:20.396
So am I, Carmen.

10:20.398 --> 10:22.398
You're fired!

10:24.239 --> 10:25.638
[Door closes]

10:26.459 --> 10:29.608
I must thank Rosie for her
recommendation.

10:29.643 --> 10:33.158
Who knew personal trainers
could be so handsome?

10:33.193 --> 10:35.240
Thank you, Mrs. Delatour.

10:35.269 --> 10:37.593
Please, call me Genevieve.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.639
Okay. Genevieve.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.075
We should get to know each
other better.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.744
Would you like to join me for a
light dinner

10:45.746 --> 10:47.113
and some heavy petting?

10:47.115 --> 10:50.082
Oh. Uh, wow. Um...

10:50.084 --> 10:52.618
I don't think that's a good idea.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.587
Because I'm a few years older than you?

10:54.589 --> 10:56.422
Are you older than me?

10:56.424 --> 10:59.158
[Chuckling] Oh, Jesse.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.928
It's just, I like to keep
my client relationships professional.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.363
I could fire you.

11:04.365 --> 11:06.132
Oh, please don't.

11:06.134 --> 11:07.967
Uh, truth is, you don't
want to get mixed up

11:07.969 --> 11:09.335
with someone like me.

11:09.337 --> 11:11.137
My love life is a complete mess.

11:11.139 --> 11:13.038
Shoulder press.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.440
Tuck those in.

11:14.442 --> 11:15.941
And one...

11:15.943 --> 11:18.844
Are you seeing someone?

11:18.846 --> 11:22.781
I was seeing this one girl,
but she went out of town,

11:22.783 --> 11:25.050
and then I kind of slept with my ex.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.219
Ah. An ex?

11:27.221 --> 11:30.156
Well, I suppose I can understand

11:30.158 --> 11:32.525
the appeal of the one who got away.

11:32.527 --> 11:34.293
So you get it?

11:34.295 --> 11:36.028
Yes.

11:36.030 --> 11:37.630
In the meantime,

11:37.632 --> 11:40.332
I am paying excellent money for
these sessions,

11:40.334 --> 11:42.134
so while you're spotting me,

11:42.136 --> 11:45.504
maybe your hands
could... slip a little?

11:48.543 --> 11:50.376
[Gasps] Oh, Carmen. Good.

11:50.378 --> 11:53.812
James wants me to send him something,
but I have no idea what it is.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.414
Dear, are you familiar with
this word?

11:55.416 --> 11:57.516
- Selfie?
- Mm.

11:57.518 --> 11:59.652
Uh, that's when you take a
picture of yourself like this.

11:59.654 --> 12:02.054
[Camera shutter clicks]

12:02.056 --> 12:03.856
[Gasps] Ooh! That's fabulous.

12:03.858 --> 12:07.359
Yeah, you have to admit,
I'm pretty handy to have around, huh?

12:07.361 --> 12:08.928
Indeed.

12:08.930 --> 12:10.996
And now that you and Mr. Powell
are separated,

12:10.998 --> 12:13.098
I-I don't feel right cleaning for him.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.367
Us girls, we have to stick
together, right?

12:15.369 --> 12:17.603
Adrian fired you, didn't he?

12:17.605 --> 12:21.340
But now I can focus all my
energy on cleaning for you.

12:21.342 --> 12:23.842
I work for Marisol's maid service.

12:23.844 --> 12:28.013
I could actually hire a good maid...
if there is such a thing.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.415
Listen, lady, the only reason

12:29.417 --> 12:31.283
Mr. Powell fired me is because
I helped you.

12:31.285 --> 12:32.418
You owe me.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.586
Do I, though?

12:33.588 --> 12:35.588
Come on.
Mr. Powell hates me now.

12:35.590 --> 12:39.425
So having me around would drive
him crazy.

12:39.427 --> 12:40.693
Don't you think?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.899
I'm so glad you agreed to meet me.

12:46.901 --> 12:48.367
Of course.

12:48.369 --> 12:50.069
I'm just surprised it's during lunch.

12:50.071 --> 12:51.770
You usually reserve this for
business.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.273
Oh. When I was in New York,

12:54.275 --> 12:57.042
all I could think about was how
much you mean to me

12:57.044 --> 12:58.978
and how badly I screwed things up.

12:58.980 --> 13:02.881
Well [scoffs] we all make mistakes.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.950
I am so sorry for what happened
with your movie.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.053
I...can't even imagine how
hurt you must've been.

13:08.055 --> 13:11.090
Peter, it means so much to hear
you say that.

13:11.092 --> 13:12.424
And another thing...

13:12.426 --> 13:14.994
I know I've been way
too focused on work,

13:14.996 --> 13:16.662
but that's about to change.

13:16.664 --> 13:18.063
It is?

13:18.065 --> 13:19.798
Look, I really want to make
this up to you,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.935
so, next week, I've
canceled all my meetings

13:22.937 --> 13:26.739
in the hopes of escaping with
you to Hawaii.

13:26.741 --> 13:29.775
[Chuckling] Oh, my God.

13:29.777 --> 13:31.944
You mean the world to me.

13:31.946 --> 13:35.147
I don't want anything to
come between us again.

13:35.149 --> 13:37.316
Let's start all over...

13:37.318 --> 13:39.351
blanket forgiveness for anything

13:39.353 --> 13:41.587
that might've happened in the past.

13:44.692 --> 13:45.824
[Glasses clink]

13:50.298 --> 13:52.197
[Laughs]

13:52.199 --> 13:53.966
Evelyn, I know you're
not speaking to me,

13:53.968 --> 13:56.135
but it appears that the East
wing is out of bourbon.

13:56.137 --> 13:57.970
[Beep] Would you mind if I
crossed to the bar

13:57.972 --> 14:00.706
for a fresh bottle?

14:00.708 --> 14:05.377
[Beep] I'll take your silence
to mean you're okay with my proposal.

14:05.379 --> 14:07.279
[Glass shatters]

14:07.281 --> 14:09.181
What the hell?

14:09.183 --> 14:11.984
If I were talking to you,
I'd have given you a warning.

14:11.986 --> 14:14.119
- What happened?
- Carmen!

14:14.121 --> 14:16.789
- I thought I fired you.
- About that...

14:16.791 --> 14:18.557
Carmen's working for me now.

14:18.559 --> 14:20.359
<i>And I'm only cleaning
her side of the house.</i>

14:20.361 --> 14:22.094
Take care of that for me, would
you, dear?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.568
There.

14:29.570 --> 14:31.303
I see.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.906
Well, I just hired a new maid
this morning to replace you.

14:33.908 --> 14:36.375
<i>I'll get her to clean it up.</i>

14:38.179 --> 14:40.646
[Bell jingles]

14:42.883 --> 14:44.183
[Bell jingles]

14:44.185 --> 14:47.152
<i>Relax! I'm coming!</i>

14:47.154 --> 14:48.887
[Sighs]

14:48.889 --> 14:50.222
Danni?

14:50.224 --> 14:51.757
Will you take care of this, please?

14:51.759 --> 14:53.258
You're back.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.328
Yeah. I'm back.

14:58.366 --> 15:00.165
[Phone ringing]

15:00.167 --> 15:02.735
Hello?

15:07.708 --> 15:09.908
[Buzzer]

15:09.910 --> 15:11.510
Can I help you?

15:11.512 --> 15:13.679
Oh.

15:13.681 --> 15:15.013
Hi, uh...

15:15.015 --> 15:18.217
I was just looking for a pen to
sign in.

15:18.219 --> 15:20.686
Hold on. I got one in my bag.

15:22.123 --> 15:26.892
So, back to see Westmore, huh?

15:26.894 --> 15:29.194
Well, you two must have a lot
to talk about.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.397
I don't know about that.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.968
Oh, I am so glad to see you.

15:35.970 --> 15:38.103
[Chuckles] Me too.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.238
[Door closes in distance]

15:39.240 --> 15:41.039
What's wrong?

15:41.041 --> 15:45.611
Is it just me, or is
that guard watching us?

15:45.613 --> 15:47.613
He's a guard. It's his job.

15:47.615 --> 15:52.551
No, I mean, I've been thinking
that someone has been spying on me.

15:52.553 --> 15:54.486
Maybe it's that guard.

15:54.488 --> 15:56.088
Why would he be spying on you?

15:56.090 --> 15:58.390
[Chuckles uneasily]

15:58.392 --> 16:01.226
I just feel like I can't
say stuff to you.

16:01.228 --> 16:05.230
I wish there was some way we
could be alone together.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.598
You mean like a conjugal visit?

16:06.600 --> 16:07.966
Yes.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.768
What's that?

16:09.770 --> 16:12.104
You know. Conjugal.

16:12.106 --> 16:13.071
Mm?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.840
Conjugal?

16:14.842 --> 16:17.075
You could keep saying it.
I still don't know what it is.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.578
Sex. Isn't that what
you're asking me about?

16:19.580 --> 16:22.514
Oh. Yes.

16:22.516 --> 16:26.084
That's how we can be alone,
let's do it.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.086
Yeah, whoa. Easy. [Sighs]

16:28.088 --> 16:32.257
It's for married couples only,
and after Ernesto came back...

16:32.259 --> 16:34.660
Our marriage was annulled.

16:34.662 --> 16:35.928
[Sighs]

16:35.930 --> 16:39.198
Look, I want to be with you, too.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.133
But rules are rules.

16:41.135 --> 16:43.302
What other choice do we have?

16:43.304 --> 16:44.770
Just one.

16:46.841 --> 16:50.108
Spence Westmore,

16:50.110 --> 16:52.478
will you marry me...

16:52.480 --> 16:53.912
again?

16:55.282 --> 16:56.082
[Chuckles]

17:00.713 --> 17:02.112
Oh!

17:02.114 --> 17:04.548
Zoila! What a nice surprise!

17:04.550 --> 17:06.817
Sorry for humping...
bumping into you.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.185
You look very nice today.

17:08.186 --> 17:09.486
What? No. No, I don't.

17:09.488 --> 17:11.121
[Scoffs]

17:11.123 --> 17:13.790
Well, I must say, you're
acting rather strangely.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.125
I have a lot on my mind.

17:15.127 --> 17:17.627
I'm, um, meeting Genevieve for lunch.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.863
We're trying to be friends again.

17:19.865 --> 17:21.397
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.536
Maybe we could get together later
for one of our little chats.

17:25.538 --> 17:28.505
Actually, Genevieve is pretty needy,

17:28.507 --> 17:31.542
so I don't think I'll be free for...

17:31.544 --> 17:33.344
a really long time.

17:33.346 --> 17:34.979
Okay.

17:34.981 --> 17:37.381
Then I'll see you when I see you.

17:37.383 --> 17:40.217
Yep. Guess I only have room
for...

17:40.219 --> 17:42.853
one rich crazy person in my life.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.321
And there she is.

17:44.323 --> 17:46.190
Got to go.

17:48.861 --> 17:52.496
Goodness. You're living with a man?

17:52.498 --> 17:54.865
You don't have to sound so surprised.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.734
Oh, sorry.

17:56.736 --> 17:58.736
What's he like?

17:58.738 --> 18:02.706
Kyle is a total mama's boy.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.209
Oh. Now it makes sense.

18:05.211 --> 18:07.911
Anyway, I've been trying
to end it with him,

18:07.913 --> 18:10.581
but he's in this huge
fight with his mother,

18:10.583 --> 18:12.883
and I can't kick him when he's down.

18:12.885 --> 18:15.252
So put him back together with
his mother.

18:15.254 --> 18:17.921
It'll soften the blow
when you break his heart.

18:17.923 --> 18:19.923
Hey, I like that.

18:19.925 --> 18:21.558
How about you?

18:21.560 --> 18:24.561
Any new men in your life?

18:24.563 --> 18:29.199
Well, I did make a pass at my
personal trainer, Jesse.

18:29.201 --> 18:34.201
He looks like the statue of
David dipped in chocolate.

18:34.373 --> 18:36.273
Jesse Morgan?

18:36.275 --> 18:38.976
Yes. Is he your trainer, too?

18:38.978 --> 18:41.945
Maybe he's not as good as I thought.

18:41.947 --> 18:44.882
No, I know him through Marisol.

18:44.884 --> 18:46.417
They used to date.

18:46.419 --> 18:49.953
Wait. I thought Marisol was
seeing Peter.

18:49.955 --> 18:52.923
No, she's still with Peter,
but she used to date Jesse.

18:52.925 --> 18:56.326
So Marisol is Jesse's ex?

18:56.328 --> 18:57.728
Yeah, I know.

18:57.730 --> 19:00.998
Marisol's love life is... complicated.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.902
Yes. It certainly is.

19:07.006 --> 19:09.306
Shannon?
What are you doing here?

19:09.308 --> 19:11.675
Well, I-I heard you were living
here now,

19:11.677 --> 19:14.144
and I need to talk to you.

19:14.146 --> 19:17.014
Oh! Are those for me?

19:17.016 --> 19:20.651
Why would they be for you?
I didn't even know you were coming.

19:20.653 --> 19:22.519
Oh. Right.

19:22.521 --> 19:24.254
[Chuckles]

19:27.293 --> 19:29.026
Look, those are for my girlfriend.

19:29.028 --> 19:32.329
She doesn't know about The Circle.
I'd like to keep it that way.

19:32.331 --> 19:33.764
Have you talked to Ben?

19:33.766 --> 19:36.300
Mother said she sent him to
Malaysia, but...

19:36.302 --> 19:37.601
Malaysia?

19:37.603 --> 19:40.771
She claims she's expanding The Circle,
but I don't buy it.

19:40.773 --> 19:43.107
Well, I don't know what's going on.

19:43.109 --> 19:45.943
But I'm done with Mother...
The Circle, too.

19:45.945 --> 19:47.811
What do you mean you're done?

19:47.813 --> 19:50.047
All Mother cares about is herself.

19:50.049 --> 19:52.182
That's what The Circle is really about,

19:52.184 --> 19:54.451
manipulating everyone into

30:31.166 --> 30:34.034
I'll check the attic out myself.
Thanks for being so thorough.

30:55.757 --> 30:59.025
Ms. Shannon?

30:59.027 --> 31:00.694
Rosie.

31:00.696 --> 31:03.763
Are you okay?

31:03.765 --> 31:06.066
Why are you burning this book?

31:06.068 --> 31:08.568
'Cause I don't need it anymore.

31:12.708 --> 31:14.407
You knew.

31:14.409 --> 31:17.310
Excuse me?

31:17.312 --> 31:19.612
About Spence not being Tucker's father.

31:19.614 --> 31:23.750
That's why you didn't want Spence
to give blood for Tucker's surgery.

31:23.752 --> 31:28.221
- This is none of your business.
- It is my business!

31:28.223 --> 31:31.725
Spence is in jail while another
man should be.

31:31.727 --> 31:35.395
Ms. Shannon.

31:35.397 --> 31:38.298
I know you two weren't close,

31:38.300 --> 31:41.634
but your sister was murdered.

31:41.636 --> 31:43.169
Your sister.

31:43.171 --> 31:45.672
Why should I care about Peri?!

31:45.674 --> 31:50.176
All she ever did was rub her
success in my face.

31:50.178 --> 31:52.011
I'm sorry.

31:52.013 --> 31:55.148
But hiding the truth won't change that.

31:57.319 --> 32:00.453
I know about The Circle.

32:00.455 --> 32:03.156
I think they framed Spence to
protect the man

32:03.158 --> 32:05.158
Peri was having an affair with.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.361
Why would you help them cover
for your sister's murder?

32:08.363 --> 32:12.198
She wasn't having an affair.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.701
She was raped.

32:14.703 --> 32:16.836
What?

32:16.838 --> 32:19.706
I came over one day and found
her in tears.

32:19.708 --> 32:23.009
Some guy had drugged her and
had his way with her.

32:23.011 --> 32:24.310
Oh, my God.

32:24.312 --> 32:27.046
Nine months later, Tucker was born.

32:27.048 --> 32:29.716
Who was he, the man who raped her?

32:29.718 --> 32:31.785
She wouldn't tell me his name.

32:31.787 --> 32:35.755
Some bigwig in the movie business.

32:38.193 --> 32:39.526
[Sighs]

32:39.528 --> 32:41.561
[Footsteps on stairs] Ah!

32:41.563 --> 32:43.863
Sorry I took so long.

32:43.865 --> 32:46.466
Hope it was worth the wait.

32:46.468 --> 32:48.034
Mm.

32:51.039 --> 32:53.072
Something wrong?

32:53.074 --> 32:54.707
You tell me.

32:54.709 --> 32:57.977
When I left, we were in a
pretty big fight.

32:57.979 --> 32:59.879
Yeah, but we worked through
[chuckling] that.

32:59.881 --> 33:01.881
Didn't we?

33:01.883 --> 33:04.317
But we didn't talk for awhile,

33:04.319 --> 33:08.488
and sometimes things... happen.

33:08.490 --> 33:11.658
Peter, what are you saying?

33:11.660 --> 33:13.359
[Sighs]

33:13.361 --> 33:15.695
I just want to make sure we're good.

33:15.697 --> 33:17.997
We're good.

33:17.999 --> 33:21.334
We are really good.

33:23.104 --> 33:25.538
That's what I thought.

33:25.540 --> 33:27.707
Shall we? Mm.

33:30.212 --> 33:31.911
[Sighs]

33:39.721 --> 33:42.689
Carmen, I... [Gasps] Oh. Sorry.

33:42.691 --> 33:45.592
I was looking for you,
but you're crying.

33:45.594 --> 33:48.962
So now I'm torn because
I still need something ironed.

33:48.964 --> 33:50.897
I'll be right there. [Sniffles]

33:50.899 --> 33:53.566
All right.

33:53.568 --> 33:55.401
Well, what is it?

33:55.403 --> 33:57.604
Nothing.

33:57.606 --> 33:59.472
Carmen, I'm pretending
to be sympathetic.

33:59.474 --> 34:01.774
The least you could do is
pretend to appreciate it.

34:01.776 --> 34:06.246
A man that I knew a
long time ago, he...

34:06.248 --> 34:08.581
he died.

34:08.583 --> 34:11.117
Oh. Well...

34:11.119 --> 34:13.253
I'm sorry for your loss.

34:13.255 --> 34:16.222
It's stupid. I haven't
seen him in 20 years.

34:16.224 --> 34:17.924
[Sniffles]

34:17.926 --> 34:20.460
But it's the first man I ever loved.

34:22.330 --> 34:25.297
Probably the only man.

34:26.835 --> 34:29.402
I understand how you feel.

34:29.404 --> 34:31.737
You do?

34:31.739 --> 34:33.840
In a way.

34:33.842 --> 34:37.243
Adrian was my first and only love.

34:37.245 --> 34:39.445
And the night of the explosion,

34:39.447 --> 34:42.315
when I thought he'd died,
I was devastated.

34:42.317 --> 34:44.817
If you repeat this,
I will throttle you.

34:44.819 --> 34:47.085
I won't.

34:47.088 --> 34:48.788
[Sighs]

34:48.790 --> 34:50.956
As the house burned, I realized

34:50.958 --> 34:54.427
that the last thing I said to
him was that I hated him.

34:54.429 --> 34:57.030
Suddenly, the thought of a life
without him

34:57.032 --> 34:58.865
was more than I could bear.

34:58.867 --> 35:01.334
That must've been hard.

35:01.336 --> 35:03.937
I think I was just afraid

35:03.939 --> 35:07.774
that I would never find anyone else.

35:07.776 --> 35:10.009
But I was wrong.

35:10.011 --> 35:13.846
It is hard to imagine when the
loss is fresh,

35:13.848 --> 35:15.949
but you will love again.

35:15.951 --> 35:19.152
Thanks.
[Exhales sharply]

35:19.154 --> 35:21.788
Of course it helps if your first love

35:21.790 --> 35:25.291
turns out to be a
real son of a bitch.

35:25.293 --> 35:28.361
[Chuckles]

35:31.366 --> 35:34.801
I need you to see what you
could find out about this man,

35:34.803 --> 35:36.703
the Reverend James Hamilton.

35:36.705 --> 35:39.238
Why are you digging in to this guy?

35:39.240 --> 35:42.742
My wife believes he's the greatest man
that ever walked the Earth.

35:42.744 --> 35:44.310
I intend to prove her wrong.

35:44.312 --> 35:46.212
And you think he's up to no good?

35:46.214 --> 35:47.647
He's a man of God.

35:47.649 --> 35:50.516
There must be a few skeletons
in his closet.

35:51.820 --> 35:55.555
I need to know what he's hiding.

35:57.177 --> 35:58.543
[Doorbell rings]

36:00.110 --> 36:01.742
Is Peter here?

36:01.777 --> 36:03.262
No.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.502
But, listen, Jesse, you can't
keep showing up here like this.

36:05.504 --> 36:08.505
Just hear me out. It's important.

36:08.507 --> 36:09.806
Okay.

36:13.445 --> 36:14.711
[Door closes]

36:14.713 --> 36:16.613
Look, I told Daniela

36:16.615 --> 36:18.148
I slept with someone while she
was gone.

36:18.150 --> 36:21.184
Don't worry. I didn't
mention your name.

36:21.186 --> 36:22.886
How'd she take it?

36:22.888 --> 36:26.056
That's the weird thing.
It didn't bother her at all.

36:26.058 --> 36:28.358
- Well, that should be a relief.
- It's not.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.160
If you really care about someone,

36:30.162 --> 36:32.496
it bothers you when they're
with someone else.

36:32.498 --> 36:34.197
I agree.

36:34.199 --> 36:38.168
Just like it bothers me that
you're with someone else.

36:38.170 --> 36:40.370
Jesse.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.973
I should have never broken up
with you.

36:42.975 --> 36:44.741
I realize that now.

36:44.743 --> 36:47.310
What we had...

36:47.312 --> 36:48.945
that's what I want.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.717
No. No, no.

36:53.719 --> 36:56.086
Marisol, you have feelings for me.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.921
- You can't deny that.
- Look.

36:57.923 --> 36:59.322
[Exhales sharply]

36:59.324 --> 37:01.525
The last thing I want to do is
hurt you,

37:01.527 --> 37:05.529
but I am with Peter now.
You have to accept that.

37:05.531 --> 37:08.098
I'm sorry, Jesse.

37:08.100 --> 37:11.268
Well...

37:11.270 --> 37:14.838
I had to give it a shot.

37:14.840 --> 37:15.806
[Sighs]

37:17.443 --> 37:18.975
Bye, Marisol.

37:26.785 --> 37:28.418
[Door closes]

37:36.595 --> 37:39.963
[Cellphone beeps, line ringing]

37:39.965 --> 37:41.965
[Sighs] Well?

37:41.967 --> 37:44.868
You were right.
Marisol's seeing her ex again.

37:44.870 --> 37:46.803
Thanks.

37:46.805 --> 37:48.338
[Cellphone beeps]

37:54.813 --> 37:56.580
[Yells]

37:56.582 --> 37:58.081
[Clatter]

38:05.257 --> 38:07.324
If you keep cleaning at night
like this,

38:07.326 --> 38:09.559
you're gonna make me look bad.
[Chuckles]

38:09.561 --> 38:12.763
You just stay on your side,
and I'll stay on mine.

38:14.099 --> 38:15.565
Danni.

38:15.567 --> 38:18.168
I know you don't want to talk to me,

38:18.170 --> 38:21.138
but there are some things that
I need to tell you.

38:21.140 --> 38:22.515
Like what?

38:24.132 --> 38:27.277
Your father, Lucas.

38:27.279 --> 38:32.082
He was the best man I ever
knew, and I loved him so much.

38:32.084 --> 38:35.952
And I know he would have married me
if I told him that I was pregnant.

38:35.954 --> 38:37.654
Then why didn't you tell him?

38:37.656 --> 38:40.624
Because I wanted to be a star.

38:40.626 --> 38:43.493
And I knew that having a
husband and a baby

38:43.495 --> 38:46.163
was gonna make it harder for me.

38:46.165 --> 38:49.099
Giving you up was the right
thing, Danni.

38:49.101 --> 38:51.535
And I know it was selfish, but...

38:51.537 --> 38:53.503
it's what I did.

38:53.505 --> 38:54.771
Great.

38:54.773 --> 38:57.474
Now I know. Is that it?

39:00.179 --> 39:02.145
Here.

39:02.147 --> 39:04.981
This belonged to your father.

39:04.983 --> 39:07.751
I know he would have loved for
you to have it.

39:17.629 --> 39:19.496
Thanks.

39:35.414 --> 39:38.248
Lucas? It's me.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.184
Listen, I don't think
you should come here.

39:41.186 --> 39:43.253
Sorry. I tried.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.822
But Carmen doesn't want to see you.

39:49.895 --> 39:52.996
So? Everything okay up here?

39:52.998 --> 39:54.364
Yeah, I don't see any damage.

39:54.366 --> 39:55.732
Oh, good.

39:55.734 --> 39:57.367
I'm so glad you're home

39:57.369 --> 40:00.070
to help me with these sorts of
things.

40:00.072 --> 40:02.239
I admit...

40:02.241 --> 40:05.041
I was lost without you.

40:05.043 --> 40:08.011
The Circle just didn't feel complete.

40:08.013 --> 40:10.447
About The Circle...

40:10.449 --> 40:13.750
I'm not gonna be involved anymore.

40:15.502 --> 40:17.454
Kyle, I'm sorry,

40:17.456 --> 40:21.258
but you're already involved
more than you know.

40:21.260 --> 40:24.861
You see, there's something else
I need you to take care of.

40:33.438 --> 40:35.038
Ben?

40:35.040 --> 40:38.742
Be a good boy and get rid of
this for me, okay?

40:39.978 --> 40:41.912
Rosie, that's horrible.

40:41.914 --> 40:46.082
I know, but I think the man who
raped Peri could be the killer.

40:46.084 --> 40:47.317
But you don't know who he is.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.585
<i>Mnh-mnh.</i>

40:48.587 --> 40:50.320
That's why I still need to find

40:50.322 --> 40:52.956
the video of Peri confessing
her secret.

40:52.958 --> 40:55.125
Maybe she said who the man was.

40:55.127 --> 40:56.893
Well, I noticed Kyle and his mom

40:56.895 --> 40:58.962
being really secretive about
the attic.

40:58.964 --> 41:01.164
It's like they don't want
anybody up there.

41:01.166 --> 41:03.833
Maybe that's where the cult meets...

41:03.835 --> 41:06.002
and where they keep the videos.

41:06.004 --> 41:10.473
So, maybe I can drum up some reason
to sneak in there and snoop around.

41:10.475 --> 41:14.144
We're going to get Spence
out of jail. I can feel it.

41:14.146 --> 41:15.679
[Door opens]

41:15.681 --> 41:17.314
Sorry, I got to call you back.

41:17.316 --> 41:20.183
Hello?

41:20.185 --> 41:22.419
Ooh! Sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

41:22.421 --> 41:24.020
I'm Fiona.

41:24.022 --> 41:26.156
Fiona!

41:26.158 --> 41:29.926
Oh, my God! I thought
you were... in Italy.

41:29.928 --> 41:31.294
Well, I'm back early.

41:31.296 --> 41:34.798
You must be Zoila, my maid.
