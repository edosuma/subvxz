-Ma!

1:11:45.802 --> 1:11:48.179
It's all unnecessary!
She didn't do anything!

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:52.016
-Be quiet! Okay?
-Okay!

1:11:52.099 --> 1:11:54.936
-I told you to calm down!
-What the fuck did I do, man?

1:11:55.019 --> 1:11:57.396
-Stop resisting!
-[grunts] I'm not resisting!

1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:00.107
-Mom! Ma!
-[groaning]

1:12:00.191 --> 1:12:02.276
-We didn't doing nothing, man!
-Be quiet!

1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:03.361
-Fuck you!
-Shut up!

1:12:03.444 --> 1:12:04.529
[grunts]

1:12:04.987 --> 1:12:06.322
[shouts] My son!

1:13:19.103 --> 1:13:21.105
[crows cawing]

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:26.527
[Romelo] I'll pay you for the car.
What was it? Three hundred something?

1:13:27.111 --> 1:13:30.031
Well, now that you got
all that Uber money, I mean, shit.

1:13:30.615 --> 1:13:33.993
I should've told you about August sooner,
but it all just happened so sudden.

1:13:35.077 --> 1:13:37.413
You are a staff member that I hired.

1:13:37.496 --> 1:13:39.874
He is a student.
How do you think that makes me look?

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.920
He wasn't smoking, he wasn't drinking,
he was just out having a good time.

1:13:44.003 --> 1:13:45.379
His mother could sue the school.

1:13:45.463 --> 1:13:47.715
-Come on.
-She just had you arrested.

1:13:49.050 --> 1:13:51.677
You know what?
As a matter of fact, this is my fault,

1:13:51.761 --> 1:13:54.347
for believing that hustle
about you needing this damn job.

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:55.723
But I did need it.

1:13:57.683 --> 1:14:00.102
Always looking for something shinier.

1:14:00.186 --> 1:14:01.812
I'm a high school rent-a-cop.

1:14:02.271 --> 1:14:04.857
-Zero shine to that, trust me.
-Mm.

1:14:04.941 --> 1:14:07.902
Vanessa, this kid is our way back in.

1:14:08.319 --> 1:14:09.987
I'm really trying to help these kids,

1:14:10.071 --> 1:14:12.114
and you out here
trying to get rich off of 'em.

1:14:13.407 --> 1:14:15.701
-Hey, Vee, that is not--
-Don't fucking touch me.

1:14:16.077 --> 1:14:18.913
I'm about a second away
from busting you in your damn mouth.

1:14:19.956 --> 1:14:21.540
Just sign the damn papers.

1:14:21.624 --> 1:14:23.960
-Vanessa, come on.
-Stop playing this house shit.

1:14:25.753 --> 1:14:27.880
I just took the boy to a block party!

1:14:29.131 --> 1:14:29.966
Really?

1:14:31.592 --> 1:14:32.885
[car engine starting]

1:14:32.969 --> 1:14:34.887
So, you're just gonna
leave me standing here, huh?

1:14:59.996 --> 1:15:01.914
I wasn't trying to be disrespectful, Mom.

1:15:02.915 --> 1:15:04.500
No one loves you more than me.

1:15:07.586 --> 1:15:08.462
You know that, right?

1:15:09.839 --> 1:15:11.507
And you know that I need you.

1:15:13.050 --> 1:15:14.301
It's just you and me now.

1:15:17.638 --> 1:15:19.223
-I just thought we was--
-[pounds table]

1:15:19.306 --> 1:15:20.141
What?

1:15:20.683 --> 1:15:22.435
You thought you'd be back
before I got home?

1:15:22.852 --> 1:15:24.729
I got to be able to trust you
in this house.

1:15:24.812 --> 1:15:27.106
Everybody liked the song
that me and Romelo made.

1:15:28.232 --> 1:15:29.191
And...

1:15:29.775 --> 1:15:30.735
Niyah was there.

1:15:30.818 --> 1:15:31.819
Oh, Niyah?

1:15:33.237 --> 1:15:35.156
Oh. So you got your nose open now.

1:15:35.239 --> 1:15:36.866
Is that why you acting so crazy?

1:15:36.949 --> 1:15:38.868
Oh, you think you're grown now, okay.

1:15:40.244 --> 1:15:42.329
I mean, you're making decisions
that affect this house,

1:15:42.413 --> 1:15:43.581
so you must think you grown.

1:15:43.664 --> 1:15:44.915
All I did was go to a party.

1:15:44.999 --> 1:15:47.626
And kids get killed at parties every day.

1:15:48.461 --> 1:15:51.047
-I wasn't even thinking about that.
-Well, I know that's right.

1:15:51.130 --> 1:15:53.007
If something had happened to you,
August...

1:15:53.090 --> 1:15:55.217
Anything could've happened to you.

1:15:55.301 --> 1:15:56.844
-But it didn't.
-And-- Don't.

1:15:58.054 --> 1:16:00.556
Don't you make it seem like
I'm the crazy one.

1:16:07.188 --> 1:16:08.439
I gotta go to work.

1:16:21.077 --> 1:16:22.036
She's right.

1:16:28.125 --> 1:16:29.251
[knocking at door]

1:16:29.877 --> 1:16:31.170
[Romelo] Come on, man, open up.

1:16:35.633 --> 1:16:36.550
I bought gyros.

1:16:37.176 --> 1:16:38.010
I can't.

1:16:38.094 --> 1:16:39.929
Come on, last night didn't end right.
All right?

1:16:40.012 --> 1:16:42.556
But we got real momentum, August.
We got to keep moving on that.

1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:43.599
Damn, man.

1:16:44.475 --> 1:16:45.351
You just don't get it.

1:16:45.434 --> 1:16:47.686
I should've never let you
talk me into all this stuff.

1:16:49.939 --> 1:16:51.816
-My mom, she--
-Hey, look, hey, hey, August,

1:16:51.899 --> 1:16:53.734
we got to keep moving on that, all right?

1:16:53.818 --> 1:16:55.444
She'll get over it, man, trust me.

1:16:55.528 --> 1:16:58.280
We can't stop the creative process, man,
look, because--

1:16:59.532 --> 1:17:01.242
[door locking]

1:17:04.578 --> 1:17:06.539
[Terrence]
You ever played billiards before?

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:10.584
She called it pool. I thought
maybe she was swinging. I wasn't sure.

1:17:10.668 --> 1:17:12.628
-[Cabrini] Guys, kill the noise.
-[Terrence] Okay.

1:17:12.711 --> 1:17:15.214
I'm saying we got to start
that cross-branding shit.

1:17:15.297 --> 1:17:16.882
We got to brand you, get that drink,

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:19.343
the-- the Cabrini Martini,
you know what I'm saying?

1:17:24.223 --> 1:17:25.474
What's going on in here?

1:17:29.228 --> 1:17:30.229
[Romelo] Huh?

1:17:32.606 --> 1:17:34.441
Sitting back thinking about
how you did Tone.

1:17:34.859 --> 1:17:37.528
-That was grimy as shit, bro.
-You don't know nothing about that.

1:17:39.238 --> 1:17:40.531
The karma not right.

1:17:40.865 --> 1:17:42.241
You got to work on that redemption.

1:17:43.033 --> 1:17:44.451
Mister, what did you do?

1:17:45.119 --> 1:17:46.203
What'd I do?

1:17:46.996 --> 1:17:47.913
Ten percent?

1:17:48.497 --> 1:17:49.665
Of your ten percent?

1:17:51.167 --> 1:17:52.334
That's the best I could get?

1:17:52.418 --> 1:17:54.003
-Me?
-Yeah, nigga.

1:17:54.086 --> 1:17:56.255
-[Mister scoffs]
-It ain't nothing personal, Ro.

1:17:56.797 --> 1:17:57.923
You still my dog.

1:17:58.382 --> 1:18:00.009
It's just business.

1:18:00.092 --> 1:18:03.053
Terrence, come on, man. What the fuck
is going on? She is my artist.

1:18:03.137 --> 1:18:05.514
It's what homegirl said.
It's nothing personal, man.

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:08.475
Come on, Mister. You know
I'm trying to get this shit right again.

1:18:09.852 --> 1:18:12.521
Trying to get this shit--
Romelo, she's too big for you, dog.

1:18:12.605 --> 1:18:13.522
What?

1:18:14.023 --> 1:18:16.901
Dog, you had to come beg me
to let her open for free.

1:18:16.984 --> 1:18:19.445
Hey. Terrence, fuck you, man!
Fuck you, man!

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:21.405
I came to you with
a motherfucking deal, man!

1:18:21.488 --> 1:18:23.199
I put hard work into this shit, man!

1:18:23.282 --> 1:18:24.867
You're not doing none of that. Back up.

1:18:25.075 --> 1:18:27.161
Can't let you put your hands
on my partner like that.

1:18:29.955 --> 1:18:31.874
-Your partner?
-Back up. My partner.

1:18:33.209 --> 1:18:34.126
Oh.

1:18:34.210 --> 1:18:36.462
We both know you would've
fucked this up, man.

1:18:40.633 --> 1:18:41.634
Okay.

1:18:44.094 --> 1:18:45.054
Fuck you.

1:18:47.181 --> 1:18:50.809
Hey, man, it is what it is.
Cabrini's part of the Ill Note family now.

1:18:52.645 --> 1:18:54.230
But you do recognize talent.

1:18:55.022 --> 1:18:57.691
Yo, what about that, uh,
that producer kid, what's his name?

1:18:58.943 --> 1:18:59.777
Austin?

1:19:02.071 --> 1:19:03.656
[Terrence] He's all you got, Romelo.

1:19:04.698 --> 1:19:06.033
Let's do business.

1:19:13.290 --> 1:19:14.124
[exhales]

1:19:20.839 --> 1:19:22.925
-What's up, man, how you been?
-Like you give a fuck.

1:19:24.843 --> 1:19:25.970
So, what you say to her?

1:19:26.053 --> 1:19:27.304
-What?
-Niyah.

1:19:28.097 --> 1:19:30.474
She ain't talking to me.
I heard you and her been kicking it.

1:19:30.557 --> 1:19:31.976
So I know you sneak dissin' on me.

1:19:32.601 --> 1:19:34.228
-I didn't say nothing about you.
-Bullshit.

1:19:34.311 --> 1:19:36.313
I ain't step to her all last year
because of you,

1:19:36.397 --> 1:19:38.565
and now we talking,
and you just wanna pop back up?

1:19:38.649 --> 1:19:39.942
That's some bitch-ass shit.

1:19:41.277 --> 1:19:42.778
Why she like your fat ass anyway?

1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:44.488
Unless you're fucking with me?

1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:47.741
She like me.

1:19:53.622 --> 1:19:55.040
[grunting]

1:19:57.167 --> 1:19:58.877
[Laz] You're supposed to be
my homie, nigga!

1:20:06.260 --> 1:20:07.386
Man, why you got that here?

1:20:07.469 --> 1:20:09.054
I wasn't gonna dead your ass.
I always got it.

1:20:09.138 --> 1:20:10.097
But you don't need it.

1:20:10.180 --> 1:20:11.932
How the fuck you gonna tell me
what I need?

1:20:12.016 --> 1:20:14.893
I'm out there doing what I gotta do,
and your ass up here not doing shit!

1:20:17.604 --> 1:20:19.064
You gonna be there when I need you?

1:20:19.773 --> 1:20:20.607
Huh?

1:20:20.983 --> 1:20:22.151
You gonna have my back?

1:20:24.570 --> 1:20:25.946
That's what the fuck I thought.

1:20:27.531 --> 1:20:29.450
I better not catch your ass
on the block again,

1:20:29.533 --> 1:20:31.785
'cause I promise you
it won't be no words next time.

Don't worry about it.
I promise you, I'm good,

-All right.

Coming down, Romeo?

1:21:37.518 --> 1:21:38.685
I can't tonight.

1:21:39.645 --> 1:21:40.562
Tonight?

1:21:40.979 --> 1:21:42.106
If not now, when?

1:21:45.359 --> 1:21:46.193
I don't know.

1:21:46.735 --> 1:21:48.320
Stop acting like a little bitch!

1:21:51.073 --> 1:21:53.075
-It ain't even like that.
-That's exactly what it is.

1:21:53.158 --> 1:21:54.159
Your ass scared.

1:21:55.202 --> 1:21:56.495
Got to make shit good again.

1:21:56.578 --> 1:21:58.163
The hell is wrong with you, August?

1:21:58.247 --> 1:21:59.331
This Chicago.

1:22:00.082 --> 1:22:02.960
Both my brothers is dead,

1:22:03.043 --> 1:22:04.211
I'm outside!

1:22:04.878 --> 1:22:06.046
My moms need me.

1:22:06.672 --> 1:22:08.006
You wrote me that song.

1:22:08.841 --> 1:22:10.175
You took me to that show.

1:22:11.593 --> 1:22:14.096
You got me standing outside
in this itchy-ass dress,

1:22:14.179 --> 1:22:16.223
and you can't even come out
the damn house, nigga?

1:22:16.306 --> 1:22:18.475
You embarrassed me in front of my friends!

1:22:20.477 --> 1:22:21.812
Lose my number.

1:22:25.732 --> 1:22:26.650
Niyah.

1:22:31.196 --> 1:22:32.990
You gonna have more fun
without me tonight.

Fuck you.

What are you doing? What is it?

1:23:31.924 --> 1:23:33.675

1:23:34.051 --> 1:23:35.594
It's okay. It's okay.

1:24:27.938 --> 1:24:28.939
Romelo.

1:24:29.856 --> 1:24:31.692
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from my son?

1:24:32.234 --> 1:24:35.487
<i>I didn't come here for that.</i>
<i>I came to talk to you.</i>

1:24:35.904 --> 1:24:37.906
"You should've ran it by me first"?

1:24:38.532 --> 1:24:39.658
That's your apology?

1:24:39.741 --> 1:24:42.327
Hm. I'm not apologizing,
just explaining what happened.

1:24:42.411 --> 1:24:43.954
Hell, I'm the one who went to jail.

1:24:44.037 --> 1:24:47.249
You ever ask yourself why a grown-ass man
is hanging out with a teenager?

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:51.420
I'm just trying to show August
the bigger life. You know, he needs--

1:24:51.503 --> 1:24:53.380
No, don't talk to me
about what my son needs.

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.216
He needs friends.

1:24:57.301 --> 1:24:58.343
