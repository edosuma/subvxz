WENDY? AHHH! FINISH HER, DUDE,
SHE'S A ZOMBIE NOW.

19:04.635 --> 19:06.035
I KNOW, BUT...

19:06.037 --> 19:06.936
BUT...

19:06.938 --> 19:07.436
C'MON STAN,

19:07.438 --> 19:10.172
REMEMBER HOW SHE DISSED YOU
AT THE COSTUME CONTEST ?

19:10.174 --> 19:11.574
YEAH.

19:11.576 --> 19:14.076
The regular sauce,
the first thing
you need to do

19:14.078 --> 19:15.578
IS MAKE SURE THAT
YOU DO NOT JUST GO OUT

19:15.580 --> 19:17.980
AND START DECAPITATING
ZOMBIES LEFT AND RIGHT.

19:17.982 --> 19:18.781
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ?

19:18.783 --> 19:20.082
DO NOT START
DECAPITATING

19:20.084 --> 19:21.917
zombies left
and right.

19:21.919 --> 19:24.253
OKAY, THEN WHAT ?

19:24.255 --> 19:25.921
WENDY, I KNOW
WE HAD A FIGHT

19:25.923 --> 19:27.356
AND I DID WISHED
YOU WERE DEAD,

19:27.358 --> 19:28.724
BUT I DIDN'T
MEAN IT.

19:28.726 --> 19:29.391
KILL HER, STAN.

19:29.393 --> 19:31.260
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KILL
THE ORIGINAL ZOMBIE.

19:31.262 --> 19:32.828
THE ONE THAT STARTED
THE WHOLE MESS.

19:32.830 --> 19:33.829
ONCE YOU KILLED
THE ORIGINAL ZOMBIE,

19:33.831 --> 19:36.031
ALL THE OTHER ZOMBIES
WILL TURN BACK TO NORMAL.

19:36.033 --> 19:36.632
ORIGINAL ZOMBIE ?

19:36.634 --> 19:38.734
HOW THE HELL DO WE KNOW
WHO THE ORIGINAL ZOMBIE IS ?

19:38.736 --> 19:41.637
WE REALIZE YOU
HAVE A CHOICE IN
WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCES,

19:41.639 --> 19:43.072
WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT...

19:43.074 --> 19:45.507
WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT THING LANDED ON KENNY

19:45.509 --> 19:47.910
AND THEY TOOK HIM
TO THE MORTUARY.

19:47.912 --> 19:50.579
I CAN'T.

19:58.256 --> 20:01.590
OH MY GOD,
I KILLED KENNY !

20:01.592 --> 20:04.426
YOU BASTARD!

20:04.428 --> 20:07.997
WHAT HAPPENED? STAN?

20:07.999 --> 20:10.232
DON'T WORRY BABE, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY

20:10.234 --> 20:11.867
THEY'RE TURNING
BACK TO NORMAL.

20:11.869 --> 20:12.501
YOU DID IT
CHILDREN !

20:12.503 --> 20:15.871
OKAY, LETS GO TICK OR
TREATING NOW, C'MOM!

20:15.873 --> 20:18.674
I'M SORRY I DISSED YOU
AT SCHOOL LIKE THAT

20:18.676 --> 20:22.978
I GUESS I JUST WASN'T VERYO
CONSIDERATE OF YOUR
FEELINGS.

20:22.980 --> 20:23.746
THAT'S OKAY WENDY.

20:23.748 --> 20:25.180
I'M SORRY I WISHED
YOU WERE DEAD.

20:25.182 --> 20:28.817
MAYBE WE CAN ACTUALLY
KISS TONIGHT, STAN.

20:31.889 --> 20:36.558
BLAH!, SICKGROSS STAN

20:36.560 --> 20:42.598
BARF IS GROSS.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.566
OH MAN, I CAN'T
BELIEVE HE'S GONE.

20:44.568 --> 20:46.802
YEAH, HE WAS TOO YOUNG
TO BE TAKEN FROM US.

20:46.804 --> 20:48.704
DUDE, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CUT HIM IN HALF

20:48.706 --> 20:49.538
WITH A CHAIN SAW.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.807
LET US REMEMBER
THE GOOD TIMES.

20:51.809 --> 20:54.843
KENNY WOULD
HAVE WANTED IT.

20:58.983 --> 21:00.182
YOU KNOW, I'VE REALLY LEARNED
SOMETHING TODAY

21:00.184 --> 21:02.051
HALLOWEEN ISN'T ABOUT COSTUMES
OR CANDY

21:02.053 --> 21:04.987
IT'S ABOUT BEING GOOD TO ONE
ANOTHER, AND GIVING AND LOVING.

21:04.989 --> 21:07.323
NO DUDE,
THAT'S CHRISTMAS.

21:07.325 --> 21:08.290
OH.

21:08.292 --> 21:09.925
THEN WHAT'S
HALLOWEEN ABOUT ?

21:09.927 --> 21:11.193
COSTUMES AND CANDY.

21:11.195 --> 21:12.895
OH.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.464
WELL LET'S GO HOME AND
START EATING THAT CANDY.

21:15.466 --> 21:16.732
WE CAN EAT IT AT
CARTMAN'S HOUSE

21:16.734 --> 21:18.801
AND SEE MORE NAUGHTY
PICTURES OF HIS MOM.

21:18.803 --> 21:19.335
YEAH.

21:19.337 --> 21:20.169
KNOCK IT OFF
YOU GUYS !

21:20.171 --> 21:22.071
SHE SAID SHE WAS YOUNG
AND NEEDED THE MONEY.

21:22.073 --> 21:25.674
CARTMAN, THOSE PICTURES WERE
TAKEN LIKE LAST MONTH

21:25.676 --> 21:29.111
