01:50.860 --> 01:53.530
<i>The cargo's rolling</i>
<i>into town from the East.</i>

01:53.613 --> 01:56.282
<i>Got a whole truck to clap</i>
<i>before it hits city limits.</i>

01:56.366 --> 01:58.785
<i>Haul's two and a half mill. Paid upfront.</i>

01:59.744 --> 02:01.621
<i>To be divied as per usual.</i>

02:03.373 --> 02:05.083
<i>Holy moly.</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:07.585
<i>This job's a bona fide</i>
<i>repmaker, that's for sure.</i>

02:07.669 --> 02:09.963
<i>Well,</i>
<i>target's a corp, ain't it?</i>

02:10.046 --> 02:12.924
<i>Convoy like that, think I know which one.</i>

02:13.800 --> 02:15.135
<i>Arasaka.</i>

02:16.761 --> 02:18.930
<i>Now, I ain't trying</i>
to water down the pot.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.349
<i>Half a mill a head is nice and all,</i>

02:21.432 --> 02:23.143
<i>but really think five of us is enough?</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:26.187
Security footprint
on the convoy's peculiarly small.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.606
'Saka probably posting a limited crew

02:28.690 --> 02:31.526
to cast a short shadow.
Keep a low profile.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.070
Let's strategize our revamp after today.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.072
<i>I don't know about that, chooms.</i>

02:36.156 --> 02:37.740
<i>No need to overthink this.</i>

02:37.824 --> 02:40.285
<i>Smash, grab, deliver. It's what we do.</i>

02:40.368 --> 02:41.786
<i>Easy peasy.</i>

02:41.870 --> 02:43.079
<i>Biz as usual.</i>

02:43.663 --> 02:45.790
<i>"Biz as usual", my ass.</i>

02:46.583 --> 02:49.586
<i>The cyberskeleton. Do you</i>
<i>truly believe he can manage it?</i>

02:51.504 --> 02:53.339
Well, Arasaka does, at least.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.801
After seeing his chemistry
mesh so well with the Sandevistan.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.430
It's why Tanaka wanted David back
at the Academy so badly.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.515
To use him as a lab rat for test runs.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.727
<i>And the girl</i>
<i>shredded David's file.</i>

03:05.810 --> 03:10.064
<i>She hoped Arasaka's plans for him</i>
<i>would simply disappear.</i>

03:10.148 --> 03:13.234
That's how I see it.
Praying Tanaka tied up a loose end.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.319
<i>Hmm.</i>

03:14.402 --> 03:16.070
<i>So, Maine and Dorio</i>

03:16.154 --> 03:18.281
<i>were mere collateral damage in her scheme.</i>

03:19.574 --> 03:21.409
Sure. In hindsight.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.204
<i>So much carnage</i>
<i>for one so petite.</i>

03:24.287 --> 03:25.663
<i>I wonder.</i>

03:25.747 --> 03:29.042
<i>How many has she killed</i>
<i>to save this one punk?</i>

03:35.506 --> 03:36.841
<i>I dove a little deeper.</i>

03:36.925 --> 03:39.677
<i>Learned she was once an Arasaka operative.</i>

03:40.595 --> 03:41.888
<i>Corp groomed her as a kid</i>

03:41.971 --> 03:44.265
<i>to mine data in the Old Net.</i>

03:44.349 --> 03:47.727
<i>Explains her cutting through</i>
<i>Arasaka ICE as if it were soap.</i>

03:49.270 --> 03:51.022
Simply too perfect.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.942
She will be the cherry we drop on top.

03:54.025 --> 03:57.070
Our guarantee Arasaka
welcomes us with open arms.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.281
This girl's a fast-lane ticket
up the corporate rungs!

04:00.365 --> 04:03.368
<i>Didn't see you</i>
<i>as such a simp corpo climber.</i>

04:03.451 --> 04:04.702
What are fixers

04:04.786 --> 04:06.663
if not glorified pet owners

04:06.746 --> 04:10.124
who keep their mercenary hounds well fed?

04:10.208 --> 04:13.419
There is but one true measure
of success in Night City.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.880
One standing in the corporate world.

04:15.964 --> 04:19.550
And to keep climbing, I shall need
your continued support.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.178
<i>Don't think you dangled me</i>
<i>out there enough already?</i>

04:22.262 --> 04:25.348
You make it sound
as if I'm forcing you.

04:25.431 --> 04:30.186
At the moment, only I have
corp immunity for the Tanaka incident.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.605
<i>Slimy as ever.</i>

04:32.689 --> 04:36.359
Come on.
Let's play nice for old-time's sake.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.696
Besides, aren't you thrilled
to take Arasaka money

04:39.779 --> 04:42.448
while fucking Militech with the same hand?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.326
I'm certain Arasaka won't object.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.580
I'll personally negotiate
your commission and immunity.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.585
<i>Never trust a soul in Night City.</i>

04:54.669 --> 04:58.256
<i>The fools</i>
<i>who make that mistake get burned.</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:03.303
<i>And David, a bargaining chip too?</i>

05:03.386 --> 05:07.849
<i>Naturally.</i>
<i>I've the perfect plan in mind.</i>

05:07.932 --> 05:11.269
<i>And I'm confident</i>
<i>Arasaka will be onboard too.</i>

05:14.147 --> 05:18.067
<i>It's me.</i>
<i>And have I got a juicy job for you.</i>

05:22.697 --> 05:26.200
<i>Emergency meeting?</i>
<i>What gives, choomba?</i>

05:27.285 --> 05:29.454
<i>Faraday came through for us.</i>

05:29.537 --> 05:31.622
<i>Scored us our biggest gig yet.</i>

05:32.415 --> 05:35.043
Huge risk, huge reward.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.128
Tack out now if you do not
want to face that kind of heat.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.130
Hm-mmm.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.136
-I'm counting on you too, Kiwi.
-Sure.

05:45.219 --> 05:49.140
Come on. Granny and Grampsy
arethe bench this round.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.726
<i>Think your little chicken legs</i>
<i>will reach the pedals?</i>

05:51.809 --> 05:53.895
<i>Yo! Fair</i>

05:54.479 --> 05:55.521
<i>What's the plan?</i>

05:55.605 --> 05:58.608
<i>Security detail. Small but elite.</i>

05:58.691 --> 06:02.862
Faraday's brought in a decoy crew to split
'Saka's attention and manpower.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.365
Come on!

06:05.448 --> 06:06.574
<i>Decoys?</i>

06:06.657 --> 06:08.534
<i>Diversion aimed</i>
<i>to give us an opening.</i>

06:08.618 --> 06:11.412
<i>Though, I'm sure Faraday</i>
<i>didn't tell them that.</i>

06:11.496 --> 06:12.538
<i>Oh.</i>

06:12.622 --> 06:14.874
<i>Classic Faraday shenanigans.</i>

06:14.957 --> 06:18.044
<i>Of course mother Anna's around</i>
<i>the bond too. Decoys for decoys.</i>

06:19.879 --> 06:21.422
You fucker!

06:55.623 --> 06:56.707
Yeah. Yeah.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.585
<i>Alright. Got 'em good</i>
<i>and split up.</i>

06:59.669 --> 07:00.628
<i>What do we do?</i>

07:00.711 --> 07:04.090
<i>Target's gone off road.</i>
<i>We have a high ground.</i>

07:04.173 --> 07:05.883
Yo. Let's roll, Falco.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.719
-Yeehaw!
-Giddyup, partner!

07:11.264 --> 07:14.517
David! Engine's warm,
snacks are packed.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.644
David!

07:17.603 --> 07:20.273
Wait. Are these… Are these
all immunoblockers?

07:22.650 --> 07:25.403
Help me out, will ya?
Grab my mom's jacket.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.488
I'm calling the gig off.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.032
-We're going to Doc--
-Becca.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.367
I got a favor to ask.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.619
-You better knock it off.
-Becca.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.415
I can't ask
any-anyone but you.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.802
Rebecca?

07:49.886 --> 07:52.930
Puppy dog eyes? You know
I'm a sucker for 'em, didn't ya?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.641
Whatever. Just don't use
your fucking Sandevistan.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.685
-You hear me?
-Okay, okay.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.660
That's one down and gone!

08:15.244 --> 08:17.163
Alright,
we're tailgating the son of a bitch!

08:17.246 --> 08:18.789
I'll hack into its braking system.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.416
Hold on. We got more on our ass.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.839
Too much. Can't get
a shot off on these guys.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.049
-Just leave it to me!
-Huh?

08:28.132 --> 08:30.301
Don't even think about
using your Sandevistan.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.353
Escort van out of commish!

08:40.436 --> 08:42.396
Guess he's fucking deaf now.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.775
-Huh?
-<i>Come on. Punch the tube.</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:48.319
<i>Becca, cargo truck's exposed.</i>
<i>Plant the charge.</i>

08:48.402 --> 08:52.657
This is what
listening looks like.

08:53.741 --> 08:57.328
You fucking asshole!

09:02.875 --> 09:04.877
All appendixes in tact?

09:04.961 --> 09:07.338
Turn around, 'stache.
Eyes on the damn road.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.548
-Hey, guys.
-Huh?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.133
Not a scratch on that thing.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.386
ICE is just as thick.
Can't crack it.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.638
Then I'll fuckin'
hit 'em head-on if I got to.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.806
Seriously. Quite showin'--

09:18.057 --> 09:21.185
You dick. Gettin' fucking tired
of being ignored.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.314
-<i>Hey, no driver!</i>
-What's that?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.650
<i>This thing's on autopilot!</i>

09:31.112 --> 09:33.739
<i>Perfect ambush. Perfect.</i>
<i>It's going perfectly.</i>

09:33.823 --> 09:37.493
<i>Exactly. Exactly as anticipated.</i>
<i>How I saw it.</i>

09:37.577 --> 09:39.745
<i>Very, very good work, Faraday.</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:42.582
<i>All projections green. On track.</i>

09:42.665 --> 09:45.209
<i>Tap's open.</i>
<i>Leaks out. Militech knows.</i>

09:45.293 --> 09:48.754
<i>Knows about the convoy.</i>
<i>You're getting your field test.</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:51.299
<i>Of course, assuming he</i>

09:51.382 --> 09:54.510
<i>the boy, can wield the cyberskeleton.</i>

09:54.594 --> 09:56.929
<i>He'd better.</i>
<i>If he can't stomach it,</i>

09:57.013 --> 09:58.347
<i>gets cold feet,</i>

09:58.431 --> 10:01.892
<i>our recovery crew will face</i>
<i>a Militech battalion.</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:04.312
<i>A stalemate.</i>
<i>Bloody, bloody. That's our aim.</i>

10:04.395 --> 10:05.896
<i>No need to worry.</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:09.900
<i>My pawns are in place, yes,</i>
<i>my opening all set.</i>

10:10.735 --> 10:14.905
<i>So, please, please, sit back,</i>
<i>relax, enjoy the show.</i>

10:16.907 --> 10:20.328
<i>Not good. Better stop it quick.</i>
<i>Got a canyon up ahead.</i>

10:20.411 --> 10:22.330
-What?
-<i>David!</i>

10:22.413 --> 10:24.290
<i>Yeah, I hear you.</i>

10:24.373 --> 10:26.792
<i>Drop back.</i>
<i>Gig's fucking chalked.</i>

10:30.171 --> 10:33.716
So. What now, Martinez?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.553
You're right on the edge.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.182
-Falco! Pull up closer now!
-Easier said than done.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.476
<i>Hey! Launch the harpoon my way!</i>

10:43.559 --> 10:44.393
The hell?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.270
<i>And slam on the brakes on my sig!</i>

10:46.354 --> 10:48.105
-<i>What are you schemin' now?</i>
-<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

10:48.189 --> 10:50.650
What the fuck? He ain't right.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.193
I'll shoot it if you won't.

11:00.242 --> 11:04.163
Choom, you got this. It's time
to cut lose. No holding back.

11:04.246 --> 11:07.166
It's just you and the road.
No doubters to slow you down now.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.044
So, show 'em who you are.

11:10.127 --> 11:13.673
What you're made of.
You're special, remember?

11:24.558 --> 11:26.394
-Brake!
-Hit it!

12:03.013 --> 12:05.057
So nova!

12:05.141 --> 12:06.767
Well, that was fun.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.394
Bit my tongue off.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.405
VIP treatment.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.199
They send an executive-class AV

12:22.283 --> 12:24.785
to collect one lone street girl.

12:24.869 --> 12:28.038
You really must be
their precious lost toy.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.337
No word? Lucy still quiet as a cricket?

12:35.421 --> 12:39.175
So what? How's another runner supposed to
help us out of this mess anyway.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.052
Gonna pay her from your cut, I hope!

12:42.136 --> 12:43.429
Kiwi, progress?

12:43.512 --> 12:46.348
Gonna need another
couple of minutes to breach the lock.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.975
Didn't know about this.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.811
Don't sit right with me
the way the truck was unmanned

12:50.895 --> 12:52.938
We damn sure it's Arasaka?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.106
If you're so worried,

12:54.190 --> 12:56.942
just grab the cargo and ghost. Hit it out.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.612
That's assuming you can pop it open quick.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.697
Your yapping is killing me literally.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.949
Can we please go get our wheels?

13:05.242 --> 13:09.038
You know, didn't really occur to me
when we first took the gig,

13:09.121 --> 13:10.831
but wide-open as it is out here,

13:10.915 --> 13:13.209
why, we'd be fishing the barrel
if someone got the jump.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.210
Jesus, old man,

13:14.293 --> 13:17.254
nervous fart like you
doesn't deserve that cowboy 'stache.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.173
Acting like a little bitch.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.717
Bet you'd go weak in the knees
if I shaved it off.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.177
Ew! Gonna kick it off.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.473
Stop wrigging. I'm tryna get ya.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.474
Shit.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.727
Decoys didn't hold out long.
We got company, folks.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.198
A Basilisk?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.450
And a missile carrier!

13:46.534 --> 13:47.952
You're shitting me.

13:48.035 --> 13:48.953
Militech!

14:05.177 --> 14:06.554
What the fuck was that?

14:06.637 --> 14:09.098
Why are we getting steamrolled
by Militech?

14:10.432 --> 14:13.602
Faraday. That son-bitch
works for Militech, doesn't he?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.564
Now, if this don't smell fishy,
I don't know what does.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.693
All set. Open.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.111
What? Already?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.363
Want cover? Get inside, quick.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.032
What in seven hells?

14:27.116 --> 14:30.870
So, this is the thing that Faraday
had Maine looking all over for?

14:30.953 --> 14:33.330
Guess so, but anyone know
what the hell it is?

14:33.414 --> 14:36.876
A cyberskeleton. Military grade implant.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.213
Military.
Wait. So, like David's Sandevistan?

14:41.297 --> 14:44.508
Several degrees more advanced.
But yeah, sure.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.676
Hey, now.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.637
That Sandevistan of his
is nothing to sneeze out either.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.056
Never ever
heard of tech like this.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.808
Believe me or don't.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.018
Far as I know,

14:54.101 --> 14:58.397
Arasaka thinks they can overtake
Militech's market share in the arms trade.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.524
But this in mass production.

15:00.608 --> 15:04.737
They kept its development hush-hush.
Like, very.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.824
Most of the info they isolated
and concentrated under Tanaka.

15:08.908 --> 15:12.995
I'd say that's how Faraday
got his Militech contract to begin with.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.999
<i>Promised to snatch the prototype,</i>
<i>setting Arasaka back years.</i>

15:18.334 --> 15:22.171
It's not every day you see the splendor
of Night City at your feet.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.257
A welcome change of scenery
compared to ice baths

15:25.341 --> 15:28.427
and austere rooms. Shame not to share it.

15:28.510 --> 15:33.015
What do you say? Will you lend a hand?
Help me make your boy fly?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.813
-David.
-Lucy. She's calling.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.025
What! No, seriously,
not the time.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.026
<i>David!</i>

15:44.109 --> 15:45.945
Lucy! Where the hell have you--

15:46.028 --> 15:48.948
-<i>The cyberskeleton. Step into it.</i>
-Huh?

15:49.031 --> 15:51.659
<i>No time. Militech's incoming.</i>

15:51.742 --> 15:54.411
<i>How could you know? Where are you?</i>

15:54.495 --> 15:56.664
-<i>They're after me, too.</i>
-Say what?

15:56.747 --> 15:59.083
<i>Do it now or everyone dies.</i>

16:01.794 --> 16:05.464
<i>Use the cyberskeleton</i>
<i>if you want to survive.</i>

16:06.090 --> 16:09.009
<i>Please, David. Before it's too late.</i>

16:09.093 --> 16:12.054
<i>Lucy… I…</i>

16:12.137 --> 16:15.432
<i>David, I believe in you.</i>

16:17.267 --> 16:19.061
-Lucy!
-What'd she say?

16:19.144 --> 16:23.190
The cyberskeleton. Gotta use it
or we're all gonna die.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.274
Huh?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.777
-Lucy wouldn't say that though.
-You sure about that?

16:26.860 --> 16:28.779
Someone's after her, too.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.907
Got no choice. I'm gonna have to chip it.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.785
This whole truck's
a mobile installation unit. Here.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.163
Deck's got the install sequence
primed and ready.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.582
No fucking way you're chipping
that fucking thing.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.042
Gotta get us out of this mess.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.002
Are you whacked?

16:43.085 --> 16:45.587
You don't even have the slightest idea
how the mystery chrome works

16:45.671 --> 16:46.714
or what it could do to you.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.591
Don't see any other options.
Do you?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.969
Besides me knocking you the fuck out?

16:52.636 --> 16:54.388
I'm gonna go grab our ride.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.140
-I'll go with you.
-Good luck!

16:56.765 --> 16:59.309
Last time I went and installed something
that wasn't mine,

16:59.393 --> 17:01.103
Maine kicked the shit out of me.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.231
Didn't learn my lesson.

17:04.314 --> 17:07.568
Don't do it! Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it!

17:10.946 --> 17:14.491
You fucking gook! Told you not to!

17:21.999 --> 17:25.502
Militech's too quiet.
What are they plotting now?

17:25.586 --> 17:27.755
Hey, Kiwi. Did you--

17:29.339 --> 17:30.841
Sorry.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.762
<i>Made good on my end.</i>
<i>I'm outta here.</i>

17:34.845 --> 17:37.389
Excellent work. Militech's expecting you.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.932
You're free to pass.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.893
Meet me at the rendezvous point.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.564
How'd you--

17:47.232 --> 17:48.192
David?

17:48.275 --> 17:49.902
L-Lucy?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.781
David, cyberskeleton's a trap!
Don't install the soft.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.700
Lucy? What happened? Are you okay?

17:56.784 --> 17:59.286
<i>That was Faraday.</i>
<i>Not me. He set us up.</i>

17:59.369 --> 18:00.788
<i>Faraday?</i>

18:00.871 --> 18:03.582
He turned caller to Arasaka.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.626
They want you in their new toy.
Got you in that truck.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.670
<i>Me? But why?</i>

18:08.754 --> 18:11.090
He's using you,
pitting you against Militech.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.634
Then, a 'Saka squad's gonna grab you.

18:13.717 --> 18:17.096
And the suit. Get out of there.
Do not use it.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.931
Did you truly think

18:19.014 --> 18:20.974
we had no failsafe in place?

18:23.060 --> 18:26.021
<i>Lucy? What happened? Lucy?</i>

18:26.105 --> 18:29.900
<i>Militech, the prototype,</i>
<i>all they want, not-not you.</i>

18:29.983 --> 18:32.736
<i>Leave it. Go. Run.</i>

18:36.365 --> 18:38.117
<i>Lucy? Lucy?</i>

18:39.118 --> 18:42.621
Shall I open a second
neural port in the back of your skull?

18:42.704 --> 18:44.998
Lucy? Answer me!

18:45.082 --> 18:48.127
-<i>I'm afraid she's currently indisposed.</i>
-Faraday?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.796
<i>I trust the job has been going well?</i>

18:50.879 --> 18:53.132
Fuck you. Put Lucy back on. Where is she?

18:53.757 --> 18:56.552
At the moment, your Arasaka runaway
is kissing the ground

18:56.635 --> 18:58.679
and should feel grateful for it.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.306
I was worried
I might've overscrambled her brain

19:01.390 --> 19:03.225
before delivering her back home.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.477
Take your fucking foot off her right now!

19:05.561 --> 19:09.439
<i>Don't be so serious.</i>
<i>I'm just having a ball of a time.</i>

19:09.523 --> 19:11.525
<i>Besides, I won't have to lift a finger</i>

19:11.608 --> 19:13.152
<i>when Arasaka's done with her.</i>

19:13.235 --> 19:14.987
Faraday!

19:15.988 --> 19:18.282
You're degenerating rapidly!

19:18.365 --> 19:21.243
At this rate, you're gonna go psycho
any second!

19:21.326 --> 19:25.622
<i>Elite Militech forces are closing in</i>
<i>on your position as we speak.</i>

19:25.706 --> 19:28.959
<i>Install the soft.</i>
<i>Use the cyberskeleton, David.</i>

19:29.042 --> 19:30.252
<i>Lead your crew to safety.</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:33.297
<i>If you ask me, I think it's beyond you.</i>

19:33.380 --> 19:36.258
<i>Clearly, Arasaka sees something I don't.</i>

19:36.341 --> 19:38.093
<i>If you're truly as special</i>

19:38.177 --> 19:39.845
<i>as they say you are, boy,</i>

19:39.928 --> 19:42.806
<i>show me what you're capable of. Survive.</i>

19:42.890 --> 19:45.267
I'm gonna rip out his spine!

19:45.350 --> 19:47.769
I'll kill him! I'll kill him.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.396
You're dead.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.648
Dead. Dead.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.400
Fucking dead!

19:53.984 --> 19:56.028
I'll fucking kill you!

19:59.114 --> 20:00.490
Back to normal?

20:00.574 --> 20:02.284
Lucy. Gonna go save her.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.537
No, guess not. Sounds like
your brain's fried.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.831
Faraday's double-crossed the crew.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.458
He's got Lucy with him now.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.335
Lucy? What do you mean?

20:11.418 --> 20:14.254
That motherfucker.
I'm gonna put him in the ground.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.757
Tear his fucking guts out
and shove 'em down his throat!

20:16.840 --> 20:17.674
Oh no.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.386
Falco! What happened?

20:21.470 --> 20:22.971
Kiwi happened.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.225
-Huh?
-She led us right into this trap.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.852
<i>That old hag's</i>
<i>mixed up in this too?</i>

20:28.936 --> 20:31.605
<i>She's a fucking flatline</i>
<i>when I see her next.</i>

20:37.861 --> 20:39.446
Dammit! Here we go again!

20:41.740 --> 20:45.369
Shit, shit, shit!
Militech needs to fucking chil!

20:45.994 --> 20:49.039
Never seen anything
this high-spec in my life.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.250
How do you even move around
in that thing?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.794
<i>Comes with</i>
<i>two compact AV thrusters built in.</i>

20:53.877 --> 20:56.171
<i>Same kind you get on an AV.</i>

20:56.255 --> 21:00.509
<i>On top of that, Arasaka engineered</i>
<i>in a gravity modification prototype.</i>

21:04.221 --> 21:08.392
<i>It can generate unidirectional</i>
<i>grav fields, magnetic forces, too.</i>

21:08.475 --> 21:11.144
That there the mag field generator?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.900
Holy hell!

21:16.984 --> 21:19.111
That's a whole squad he just mowed down.

21:19.194 --> 21:22.489
Oh, geez. He's using his Sandy, too.

21:37.796 --> 21:42.134
Huh?

21:44.928 --> 21:46.096
He's flying!

21:46.179 --> 21:47.848
Is that thing the grav field?

21:54.730 --> 21:56.565
<i>Shown to be inconsistent</i>
<i>in field tests.</i>

21:57.566 --> 21:58.692
<i>Those who are wielding it,</i>

21:58.775 --> 22:01.069
<i>can't withstand the strain</i>
<i>on their nervous system.</i>

22:02.988 --> 22:07.868
<i>It requires someone with an abnormally</i>
<i>high tolerance for cyberware integration.</i>

22:07.951 --> 22:10.662
<i>Sure fire way to go</i>
<i>cyberpsycho, you mean.</i>

22:22.382 --> 22:23.925
No. They got our boy?

22:24.509 --> 22:25.927
<i>David.</i>

22:34.394 --> 22:35.687
Kid's still going.

22:36.271 --> 22:38.065
Yeah, his body is, but…

22:38.148 --> 22:39.608
<i>The longer one uses it,</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:43.612
<i>the higher the risk of bodily</i>
<i>cyberware capacity overload.</i>

22:43.695 --> 22:45.155
<i>But being said,</i>

22:45.822 --> 22:48.075
<i>the power it generates in the short-term…</i>

22:51.912 --> 22:55.582
<i>…is unlike anything</i>
<i>on this side of sanity.</i>

23:05.133 --> 23:06.301
David?

23:12.849 --> 23:15.519
<i>Faraday's gonna regret</i>
<i>playing us like dogs.</i>

23:15.602 --> 23:17.896
<i>And we're getting Lucy out of there.</i>

23:17.979 --> 23:19.147
But David…

23:19.231 --> 23:21.149
Maine said everyone gets a fair shake.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.528
That's the only way I operate too.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.907
Sign me up, choomba.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.618
Into the fire.
