WEBVTT

00:10.714 --> 00:12.615
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:12.649 --> 00:15.350
But let me just
lay out the case.

00:15.384 --> 00:18.686
The case... you have
an engagement in San Francisco.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.123
At the last minute,
your father zooms off

00:22.158 --> 00:26.428
to speak to a bunch of swooning
Jungian analysts is taos.

00:26.463 --> 00:28.666
Jesus!

00:28.701 --> 00:32.938
So you call your
ever-dependable/psychotic

00:32.972 --> 00:35.874
ex-wife.

00:37.911 --> 00:40.646
Dependable, that is,
in her psychosis.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.881
So next thing you know,

00:42.915 --> 00:44.182
you're taking him
to work with you.

00:44.216 --> 00:47.051
And there it is.
Case solved.

00:47.086 --> 00:49.221
Shit!

00:49.255 --> 00:51.090
Frisco's got
the best food trucks.

00:51.124 --> 00:53.025
I am so ready to try
some street meat.

00:53.059 --> 00:56.361
Okay, let's
rephrase that, all right?

00:56.395 --> 00:59.163
Now, listen. You're gonna be
meeting some people in there,

00:59.198 --> 01:02.066
and I want you to remember
that home stuff is private.

01:02.101 --> 01:03.703
I gotcha, dad.

01:03.737 --> 01:05.203
I'm just happy to be
skipping school.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.474
- Yeah, about school...
- Great.

01:07.508 --> 01:09.645
Grandpa told you?
Yeah, he told me.

01:09.679 --> 01:11.246
You didn't.

01:11.281 --> 01:13.482
What's going on in school?
Nothing.

01:13.516 --> 01:15.150
Roscoe.

01:15.184 --> 01:18.186
A couple of kids started
this thing about me at lunch.

01:18.220 --> 01:19.837
- Who?
- Nobody.

01:21.257 --> 01:23.125
I got to call principal Gita.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.728
No Gita, please.

01:24.762 --> 01:27.464
I just want to go to Frisco
and chill, okay?

01:27.499 --> 01:28.499
Okay, then we'll chill.

01:28.533 --> 01:29.868
But don't say "Frisco,"
all right?

01:29.902 --> 01:32.458
Only losers say Frisco.
We're not losers. Am I right?

01:32.581 --> 01:34.315
- Right.
- All right, give it up.

01:38.011 --> 01:40.433
Sync and corrections by <font color="#ffff00">APOLLO</font>
<font color="#00ff00"> www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:43.048 --> 01:44.448
Switch.

01:44.483 --> 01:46.851
So now that we're engaged,

01:46.886 --> 01:50.455
I think we should have a party.

01:50.489 --> 01:51.990
My mom will love that shit.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.692
- Your mom will love anything
with free-flowing booze.

01:54.726 --> 01:57.361
I bet your dad has to
piss vodka to get a blowie.

01:57.395 --> 02:00.998
Poor guy.
My God, really?

02:01.032 --> 02:02.533
My mom giving my dad a blow job

02:02.567 --> 02:03.701
before I've even had my eggs?

02:03.735 --> 02:05.736
Yeah. Sorry.

02:05.771 --> 02:07.605
But really, who cares
what your mom loves?

02:07.639 --> 02:09.107
We're not doing this for them.

02:09.140 --> 02:11.210
Just family and friends.

02:11.244 --> 02:12.978
Like, I can finally
meet all these guys

02:13.013 --> 02:14.881
I share you with every week.

02:14.915 --> 02:17.150
If you met them, you'd rethink.

02:17.184 --> 02:18.584
And you're gonna miss
your flight.

02:18.619 --> 02:20.620
Shit.

02:20.655 --> 02:23.290
- Okay. I love you. Bye.
- Bye.

02:23.324 --> 02:26.559
- Think about it.
- I will.

02:26.594 --> 02:29.629
- I... I... I am listening to you.
- You're not.

02:29.663 --> 02:31.164
It's impossible not to.
Listen... you're yelling...

02:31.198 --> 02:33.065
- Blanca is a ten-pointer.
Hello.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.167
- No. No, no, no.
Because a ten-pointer requires

02:35.202 --> 02:36.836
a ruling from
a disinterested party.

02:36.870 --> 02:38.337
- You're an idiot.
- That's all I'm saying.

02:38.371 --> 02:40.272
Wait, Jeannie?
Completely uninterested.

02:40.307 --> 02:41.941
- Perfect.
- And we have our judge.

02:41.975 --> 02:45.078
Thank you so much, Jeannie.
Subject, Blanca Garcia,

02:45.112 --> 02:47.413
AKA one hot piece of TSA ass.

02:47.448 --> 02:49.749
Now, as you know,
Blanca's TSA status

02:49.784 --> 02:52.486
automatically makes
my odds of success

02:52.520 --> 02:55.122
exponentially lower than some
sort of airport bar pickup.

02:55.156 --> 02:56.290
So why don't you go ahead
and give me...

02:56.325 --> 02:57.658
- Three points. Yeah.
- Three points.

02:57.693 --> 02:59.594
Now, her initial response
was "no,"

02:59.628 --> 03:01.463
which I could not believe
'cause I got all this...

03:01.497 --> 03:02.630
- I can believe it.
- And all this.

03:02.665 --> 03:03.798
All right, get to the point,
Clyde.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.967
I dusted off my backup game...
shush, shush.

03:06.002 --> 03:08.303
Turned that no into
a coy little,

03:08.337 --> 03:10.872
"I get off at 5:00."

03:10.907 --> 03:13.708
Now, as you know,
reversing a "no" is worth...

03:13.743 --> 03:15.677
Three points.
Would you get to the end?

03:15.711 --> 03:17.679
Later on that night,
came back to my place,

03:17.713 --> 03:19.614
I straight up rocked her world.

03:19.648 --> 03:21.816
Once, twice...
Okay.

03:21.851 --> 03:24.285
- Paused... three times.
- I don't believe you.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.021
- You don't believe it?
- Absolutely not.

03:26.055 --> 03:28.290
Okay, fine.
She sent me this video.

03:28.324 --> 03:31.360
- Holy shit, man!
- Yeah.

03:31.395 --> 03:34.164
Two points for the clothes,
two for the video.

03:34.198 --> 03:35.899
And the judge rules...

03:35.933 --> 03:38.669
<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i>

03:38.703 --> 03:40.170
Blanca's a ten.
Yeah.

03:40.204 --> 03:41.838
- Forward that to me.
- I can forward it to you easy.

03:41.872 --> 03:43.139
For those keeping score
at home,

03:43.173 --> 03:46.575
I'm officially up 23 points.

03:46.610 --> 03:47.743
All right, listen,
do you want to know why

03:47.777 --> 03:49.111
your score is so high?

03:49.145 --> 03:52.147
Because you try to hump anything
with a <i>Jinny,</i> all right?

03:52.181 --> 03:55.216
- Douglas, you say <i>Jinny?</i>
- Yes.

03:55.251 --> 03:56.985
Regardless, the reason why
I'm winning is because

03:57.019 --> 03:58.586
I don't get bogged down
in the romance.

03:58.621 --> 04:00.188
- I like romance.
- What I do is

04:00.222 --> 04:03.691
I tap that ass,
shake it off, and move on.

04:03.726 --> 04:07.195
- You're a sex offender.
- I tap and move, grasshopper.

04:07.229 --> 04:08.497
Just tap it...

04:08.531 --> 04:10.667
What are we tapping?

04:10.701 --> 04:13.903
Team, this is Roscoe.

04:13.938 --> 04:15.405
Roscoe, this is...
this is the team.

04:15.439 --> 04:19.877
Hey, you looking forward
to Frisco, little man?

04:21.379 --> 04:24.281
I heard you absolutely
slayed it as Rizzo.

04:24.316 --> 04:25.349
Yeah.

04:25.383 --> 04:26.985
I brought the house down.
Okay?

04:27.019 --> 04:28.819
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:28.853 --> 04:31.255
We're playing Jacks
with another kid this week.

04:31.289 --> 04:34.491
20-year-old CEO
Alex Katsnelson

04:34.526 --> 04:36.560
of NinjaKatz Technologies.

04:36.595 --> 04:39.230
Created the security software
NKT.

04:39.264 --> 04:40.731
Yeah, the best hacker
since Meitzer.

04:40.765 --> 04:43.434
A Harvard man too, so check it.

04:43.469 --> 04:44.702
No one's gonna check it.

04:44.737 --> 04:46.237
Now, the board wants to
expand internationally

04:46.271 --> 04:47.839
without Alex.

04:47.873 --> 04:50.841
But Alex wants us to prove
that he's an asset. <i>The</i> asset.

04:50.876 --> 04:53.344
Okay?
Got to skin this pig.

04:53.378 --> 04:55.880
Afterwork. Afterwork.
Jiggity-jig.

05:01.253 --> 05:02.686
Is this how you roll
on the road?

05:02.721 --> 05:04.454
Big pimpin', right?

05:04.489 --> 05:08.959
Yeah. I could definitely
get used to it, but...

05:08.993 --> 05:12.363
What exactly do you guys do?

05:17.269 --> 05:20.438
That is the one question that we
management consultants hate.

05:20.472 --> 05:22.707
So we have become
lords of the dance.

05:27.045 --> 05:30.348
See, companies hire us
to solve the case,

05:30.382 --> 05:32.817
you know, fix whatever it is
that's making them suck.

05:32.851 --> 05:35.252
So we come in
and we give 'em advice.

05:35.287 --> 05:38.489
It's something we call wags.
Wild-ass guesses.

05:38.523 --> 05:40.257
- You good at it?
- I'm very good at it.

05:40.292 --> 05:42.193
Hey, you know what, buddy,
you cannot come in here...

05:42.227 --> 05:45.096
Let me give you a couple bucks.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.330
Get some stuff
out of the machine.

05:46.365 --> 05:47.766
You're hungry, right?
Yeah.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.969
Not too much sugar.
Stay right there.

05:51.004 --> 05:53.673
- Go on ahead.
- Don't say shit.

05:53.707 --> 05:58.311
So... a chick, a Jew,
a WASP, and a black guy

05:58.346 --> 05:59.479
walk into an office.

05:59.513 --> 06:02.016
You are a charmer.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.484
I'm Marty Kaan.

06:03.518 --> 06:04.718
We're the team from Galweather,

06:04.753 --> 06:06.821
and we are charging you
a king's ransom,

06:06.855 --> 06:09.057
so we don't want to waste a lot
of time playing games. Okay?

06:09.091 --> 06:10.825
- That's fine with me.
- Here's the deal.

06:10.859 --> 06:13.661
NKT was revolutionary.
This is truth.

06:13.695 --> 06:16.230
You were positioned to take over
the international market,

06:16.265 --> 06:19.033
and now the board wants to
kick you off the fuckin' train.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.001
Ridiculous.

06:21.036 --> 06:23.872
You. The one who started this
whole thing from your dorm room

06:23.906 --> 06:25.740
while spankin' the monkey
before your 8:00.

06:25.775 --> 06:28.477
- God, he's taking me back.
- Me too.

06:28.511 --> 06:29.544
Marty, let's get
something straight.

06:29.579 --> 06:30.846
I don't want to have
some sort of

06:30.880 --> 06:32.281
corporate capitalist
dick fight with the board,

06:32.315 --> 06:33.348
'cause that's not me.

06:33.383 --> 06:35.250
- Clearly.
- No.

06:35.285 --> 06:36.919
But I want you to
make them see that I am ninja.

06:36.954 --> 06:39.188
- You, you're ninja. Yeah.
- It's him.

06:39.223 --> 06:40.390
Because those corporate
assholes,

06:40.424 --> 06:41.591
they'll listen to
corporate ass kissers.

06:41.625 --> 06:42.691
That's for sure.

06:42.726 --> 06:44.260
Well, sir, you're in luck,

06:44.294 --> 06:45.794
because we are
those ass kissers.

06:45.829 --> 06:48.797
Hell, Mr. Katsnelson, if you
want us to <i>lick</i> ass, we will...

06:48.831 --> 06:51.366
I mean, we're kind of cut
from the same cloth.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.301
All right, look,
here's what we're gonna do.

06:53.335 --> 06:54.602
Why don't you guys... why don't
you guys work off-site.

06:54.637 --> 06:55.636
Let's keep suspicions down.

06:55.670 --> 06:58.672
But if you guys
really want to know

06:58.707 --> 07:00.274
what ninja's all about,
I think,

07:00.308 --> 07:02.276
somebody should probably
roll with me.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.111
I'm thinking blondie...
Guess I'm rolling with you.

07:04.145 --> 07:06.648
You? Okay. That works.

07:06.682 --> 07:08.149
Right. Well, who's gonna
look after the kid?

07:08.184 --> 07:10.152
- Not it.
- Not it as well. Shit.

07:10.186 --> 07:12.254
Hey, so, Roscoe,

07:12.288 --> 07:14.323
you playing a little
arcade game there

07:14.357 --> 07:15.791
on the... on your thing?

07:15.826 --> 07:17.827
Yeah. I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

07:17.861 --> 07:19.429
Yeah. Okay.

07:19.463 --> 07:22.665
But do you want me to...
Come with?

07:22.699 --> 07:23.766
Dude, I'm ten.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.035
Right. Of course.

07:26.069 --> 07:28.604
Okay, well, hey, pound it out.

07:28.638 --> 07:31.640
Don't leave me... hanging.
You left me hanging.

07:31.674 --> 07:34.175
Fuck, even your kid game
is weak.

07:34.210 --> 07:35.176
- It is not.
- It is.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.277
Not.

07:36.311 --> 07:37.678
Yeah, I designed
this whole thing myself.

07:37.713 --> 07:39.614
I was going with sexy tech.
Girls love the sexy tech.

07:39.648 --> 07:40.781
Trust me on that one.

07:40.816 --> 07:42.016
So down here is basically
just, like,

07:42.051 --> 07:43.284
special-Ops team.

07:43.319 --> 07:44.519
It's, like, 100 Alexes
walking around

07:44.553 --> 07:45.954
making me <i>mon-ay!</i>

07:45.988 --> 07:47.589
Cha-motherfuckin'-ching, baby!

07:47.623 --> 07:49.825
It's just dumb!
Come on. Let's go in here.

07:52.329 --> 07:53.629
There she is.

07:53.664 --> 07:55.765
- Hello there.
- Hey, baby.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.067
I brought some very nice pieces

07:57.101 --> 07:58.335
from our store collection.

07:58.369 --> 07:59.804
Yeah, I see that.

07:59.838 --> 08:01.172
And perhaps you're interested
in purchasing

08:01.206 --> 08:02.840
a piece of jewelry, mister...

08:02.875 --> 08:04.608
Marty Kaan.

08:04.643 --> 08:05.743
How 'bout I make you two drinks

08:05.777 --> 08:07.445
while you guys take a look?

08:07.479 --> 08:08.512
You know what,
that sounds great.

08:08.547 --> 08:09.847
You know where
the bar is, babe.

08:09.881 --> 08:12.683
- I do.
- Thank you so much.

08:15.821 --> 08:18.690
So you don't have any allies
on the NinjaKatz board.

08:18.724 --> 08:20.424
No. They all
stopped talking to me

08:20.459 --> 08:23.828
after the Matrix deal.
Bunch of crybabies, right?

08:23.862 --> 08:25.696
Can you believe that?

08:25.730 --> 08:28.532
Two years ago, a girl like that
wouldn't even talk to me.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.502
Look at me now, right?
Yeah, she's all over you.

08:31.537 --> 08:33.371
It's probably because
I got the black in the pants.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.240
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:35.275 --> 08:37.042
The black card.

08:37.077 --> 08:39.211
Yeah, that shit's
a pussy magnet, I'm telling you.

08:39.246 --> 08:41.815
And I'm, like, this close
to just... mm!

08:41.849 --> 08:43.249
Hittin' that.
You know what I mean?

08:43.284 --> 08:45.318
Yeah. <i>Word!</i>

08:45.353 --> 08:47.254
I'm thinking hardwood floors.

08:47.288 --> 08:49.356
Nah, that's a manicured lawn
going on down there.

08:49.391 --> 08:51.225
No, no, come on.
So out of touch.

08:51.259 --> 08:54.062
Do me a favor.
Look at her arms.

08:54.096 --> 08:55.797
No hair. Do you see hair?
No.

08:55.831 --> 08:57.766
She's Armenian.
Those fuckers are hairy.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.835
So what that tells me is

08:59.869 --> 09:02.104
no hair on the arms means
laser hair removal.

09:02.138 --> 09:04.540
You know, man, Vagina!

09:04.574 --> 09:05.608
- Good deduction.
- Yeah.

09:05.642 --> 09:08.043
So...
See anything you like?

09:08.078 --> 09:09.678
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I do.

09:09.713 --> 09:11.414
- Really.
- Thank you so much.

09:11.448 --> 09:15.718
It appears Matrix
was a monster deal.

09:15.752 --> 09:19.088
A $6 billion monster deal
that Alex killed

09:19.122 --> 09:21.256
with a weapon called
micromanagement.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.193
So then Matrix hooked up
with ninja's biggest competitor.

09:24.227 --> 09:26.528
Daddy, wait a second.

09:26.563 --> 09:28.898
Are you wearing a new bracelet?

09:28.932 --> 09:30.032
Yes.

09:30.067 --> 09:32.435
Yes, you are.
Yes. Yes, I are.

09:32.469 --> 09:35.071
It's tasteful.
Not too "look at me!"

09:35.105 --> 09:37.039
All right, I'll play.
Why?

09:37.074 --> 09:39.775
It's just because I'm minding

09:39.810 --> 09:41.811
my own damn business, Doug. You?
Yeah. Same.

09:41.845 --> 09:43.779
Don't poke the bear
when he's hungry.

09:43.814 --> 09:45.782
He was a nightmare
on Jenny Craig.

09:45.816 --> 09:48.151
God!

09:48.185 --> 09:49.285
Really?

09:49.320 --> 09:50.387
Really?

09:50.421 --> 09:51.821
Was it water weight
or regular weight?

09:51.856 --> 09:53.223
Listen,

09:53.257 --> 09:57.327
we need to start chunking out
the journeyline here.

09:57.362 --> 09:59.262
Okay, Alex is obviously
a bottleneck.

09:59.297 --> 10:01.431
And if he keeps running
NinjaKatz,

10:01.465 --> 10:03.132
he's gonna ruin
international expansion.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.800
So he gots to go.

10:04.835 --> 10:08.837
But here's the interesting part.
We gots to stay.

10:08.871 --> 10:10.905
My God, so you want us
to talk him into

10:10.940 --> 10:12.173
leaving his own company...

10:12.207 --> 10:14.241
And then get him
to ask the board

10:14.276 --> 10:15.642
to give us the afterwork.

10:15.677 --> 10:18.012
Mm, sometimes you are
the perfect man.

10:18.046 --> 10:22.516
Thank you.

10:22.550 --> 10:25.986
Alex wants to hang tonight,
<i>dawg.</i>

10:26.020 --> 10:27.321
- Now, is that d-o-g or...
- No.

10:27.355 --> 10:29.623
- It's gonna be d-a-w-g.

10:29.657 --> 10:33.194
Hey...

10:33.228 --> 10:35.363
I know I said that we were
gonna go check out

10:35.398 --> 10:36.631
some food trucks tonight,

10:36.666 --> 10:39.367
but I mean, I got to...
It's cool, dad.

10:41.027 --> 10:42.886
I'll just kick it
with the crew.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.074

11:02.228 --> 11:03.629
I like you, Marty.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.764
What I'm about to show you
is under the radar, okay?

11:05.799 --> 11:07.232
Welcome to hackers heaven.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.269
Yeah.
Home sweet home.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.037
These are my hacking peeps.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.773
The keepers of
the information conversation.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.275
Ya know?
Yeah.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.643
- Hacktivism, baby!
- Fuck yeah.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.180
Here we go.
Daddy's home.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.751
What's up?
What up, Jeff?

11:24.785 --> 11:26.052
He's just...
he's playing.

11:26.087 --> 11:27.654
Probably just not comfortable

11:27.689 --> 11:29.189
'cause you know,
you're an outsider.

11:29.224 --> 11:30.257
Yeah, that's what that was.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.358
Just play it cool.
Play it cool.

11:31.393 --> 11:33.427
Marty, so what we personally
believe in

11:33.461 --> 11:35.663
is the freeing of information
from the corporate overlords,

11:35.697 --> 11:37.198
'cause that's not right,
you know.

11:37.232 --> 11:39.300
And me and DJ right here,
we wrote a manifesto and shit.

11:39.335 --> 11:41.269
Then this asshole decided
to code some software

11:41.303 --> 11:44.438
that locks up information
<i>for</i> the corporate overlords.

11:44.473 --> 11:47.207
Come on.

11:47.242 --> 11:50.044
Why are you clownin' me, dawg?

11:50.079 --> 11:51.246
Always clownin' on me.

11:54.617 --> 11:57.084
She's perfect, Doug.
A seven.

11:57.119 --> 11:58.519
You see, you never go
for a ten,

11:58.553 --> 11:59.820
but I'm gonna tell you
everything you need to know

11:59.854 --> 12:01.354
right now... you ready?

12:01.388 --> 12:04.757
Here it comes.
Be Clooney.

12:04.792 --> 12:05.792
Clooney?

12:05.827 --> 12:07.461
Yeah. Look at this.

12:07.495 --> 12:09.362
Clooney, man.
Laugh at yourself.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.698
Stand by your ideals.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.200
Be one suave motherfucker,
and I guarantee

12:14.234 --> 12:17.068
you will get women shimmying out
of their skinny jeans so fast

12:17.103 --> 12:18.403
it'll be fucking insane.

12:18.437 --> 12:19.938
So be suave, ideals...
That's a good one.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.206
You don't even have to
write it down

12:21.240 --> 12:22.207
because this is all
you need to know.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.475
Whenever you have any question

12:23.509 --> 12:25.143
of what you should be doing,
just ask yourself this...

12:25.177 --> 12:27.745
what would Clooney do?

12:27.780 --> 12:29.880
Right. Right.
Okay, okay.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.817
And what <i>would</i> Clooney do?
He would tap that fuckin' ass!

12:32.851 --> 12:34.318
- Of course. Yeah, yeah.
- He would fuckin' tap that ass!

12:34.353 --> 12:36.086
What would Clooney do?
He's goin' tappin' ass.

12:36.121 --> 12:38.761
- Jesus Christ!
- I got it.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.703
Hey.
Hi.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.877
So...
So...

12:59.911 --> 13:01.645
Darfur sucked, huh?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.780
Yeah.

13:03.814 --> 13:05.615
Push, push, push.
Keep going. Keep going.

13:05.650 --> 13:08.784
Okay, head down, eyes up,

13:08.819 --> 13:09.785
a slight cock to the head.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.154
And... hey.

13:12.188 --> 13:13.188
- Hi.
- Hi...

13:13.223 --> 13:14.757
Lucy.

13:14.791 --> 13:18.293
Hey.

13:18.327 --> 13:21.163
Could you go back to your seat?

13:21.197 --> 13:23.866
There's people trying to order.

13:35.246 --> 13:36.947
What the fuck was that?

13:36.981 --> 13:38.348
What the fuck
are you talking about?

13:38.383 --> 13:39.350
That was Clooney.

13:39.384 --> 13:40.718
Which Clooney is that?

13:40.752 --> 13:42.353
'Cause I've never seen that
in my entire life.

13:42.387 --> 13:44.688
The <i>facts of life</i> Clooney.
The relatable everyman.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.290
TV's Clooney is not
the real Clooney,

13:46.324 --> 13:47.658
unless you're talking <i>E.R.</i>
Then barely.

13:47.692 --> 13:48.892
Maybe one season of Clooney.

13:48.927 --> 13:51.195
Why am I only
just hearing about that?

13:51.229 --> 13:53.096
Because who remembers
George Clooney from <i>facts...</i>

13:53.130 --> 13:54.698
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys!

13:58.903 --> 14:01.171
So you're not a big
Alex fan, I take it.

14:01.205 --> 14:03.573
He can suck my fat brown dick.

14:03.608 --> 14:05.008
Not a fan.

14:05.042 --> 14:06.009
Yeah, we made big plans,

14:06.044 --> 14:07.444
then he sells out
for blood money.

14:07.478 --> 14:08.679
Now he's trying
to make up for it

14:08.713 --> 14:10.047
with some backdoor shit
in his code,

14:10.081 --> 14:12.816
and he's talking to
corporate Jacks like you.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.486
So not a fan at all.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.888
There's a backdoor
in the software.

15:18.645 --> 15:20.946
Slow down.
Shut up.

15:43.637 --> 15:47.573
You're right. I mean, this is
some quality street meat.

15:57.785 --> 16:01.088
So my dad says you guys are
good at solving cases.

16:01.122 --> 16:04.491
Did... did he say I was
good at it, specifically?

16:04.526 --> 16:06.626
Like, "Doug is the best"?

16:06.660 --> 16:09.262
No?
Just a question.

16:09.297 --> 16:10.663
What if there is this kid,

16:10.698 --> 16:14.100
and some big fat kid
with a thyroid problem

16:14.135 --> 16:16.369
who picked on him at lunch,

16:16.404 --> 16:20.006
and the kid's grandpa said
just to ignore it,

16:20.041 --> 16:22.475
but the kid just wanted to

16:22.510 --> 16:25.745
fuck the little
thyroid bitch up?

16:25.780 --> 16:30.785
You know,
I actually had a case like this

16:30.819 --> 16:32.052
a few years back.

16:32.087 --> 16:35.889
There was this kid who,
I mean, he was handsome.

16:35.924 --> 16:39.267
Not in the classic sense,
but handsome.

16:39.828 --> 16:43.164
And smart.
Was he smart.

16:43.198 --> 16:44.498
Genius level, really.

16:44.533 --> 16:45.499
Destined for Harvard.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.334
- I get it.
- Right.

16:48.962 --> 16:52.572
And...
There was this other kid...

16:53.413 --> 16:56.272
Who... tortured him.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.547
He really just...
Tortured him.

17:00.582 --> 17:04.252
And the kid's mom was, like,
you know,

17:04.286 --> 17:06.989
"stop all the crying, Doug."
You know?

17:07.022 --> 17:10.358
But then this kid realized
that the other kids...

17:10.394 --> 17:13.063
Were just jealous.

17:13.097 --> 17:14.832
That's all.

17:14.866 --> 17:19.106
Jealous of his awesome...
awesomeness.

17:21.172 --> 17:25.242
And you know, he went on
to be super awesome.

17:25.276 --> 17:29.845
And today that kid is
Justin Bieber.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.213
True story.

17:31.248 --> 17:32.781
Dude, you already said
it was you.

17:32.816 --> 17:33.915
I know.

17:33.950 --> 17:35.217
I kind of just thought
the Bieber thing

17:35.251 --> 17:37.519
would add the necessary pop
at the end.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.525
Why are you getting dressed?

17:43.559 --> 17:45.193
Because we're done.

17:45.227 --> 17:47.929
What?
No, we're not.

17:47.963 --> 17:51.499
Dance for me, Roxie.

17:51.534 --> 17:53.368
Excuse me?

17:53.403 --> 17:54.736
It's Roxie, right?

17:54.770 --> 17:57.506
Robin.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.641
And I don't like
being told what to do.

17:59.676 --> 18:02.044
I think you do.

18:02.078 --> 18:03.378
You do?

18:03.413 --> 18:04.880
I think you'll do
whatever I ask.

18:04.915 --> 18:07.950
Just because we fucked?

18:07.984 --> 18:10.952
Actually, you fucked me.

18:10.987 --> 18:14.523
You controlled
that whole situation.

18:14.557 --> 18:16.124
I mean, you wish
I'd fucked you.

18:16.159 --> 18:18.760
I think you wish
someone would take you

18:18.795 --> 18:21.062
and fuck your brains out.

18:21.097 --> 18:23.899
'Cause whoever's doing it now
isn't doing it right.

18:23.933 --> 18:27.269
That's what I think.

18:27.303 --> 18:28.304
Come on.

18:35.512 --> 18:37.180
You'll never see me again.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.852
Like this?

18:48.793 --> 18:50.961
Yeah, like that.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.784
So what's your real name?

19:14.552 --> 19:15.920
Jeannie.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.093
And I smoked better weed
than this

19:21.127 --> 19:22.761
with my seventh grade teacher.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.824
Fuck me!

19:59.965 --> 20:05.070
And he got down on one knee
and... proposed.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.005
And it was...

20:07.040 --> 20:08.740
It was...

20:08.775 --> 20:11.470
it was lacking in originality?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.780
Well, his family owns
11 Picassos,

20:14.814 --> 20:18.439
so he could literally buy
originality.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.753
Maybe he should buy
some fidelity first.

20:21.787 --> 20:25.023
I don't cheat on him.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.260
You do see the irony
of that statement

20:28.294 --> 20:29.928
in this moment, right?

20:29.962 --> 20:33.431
Well, you...
This, tonight...

20:33.466 --> 20:37.569
And your penis
and your mediocre weed,

20:37.603 --> 20:40.971
they don't have anything
to do with my real life.

20:41.006 --> 20:44.675
No.
Of course not.

20:47.078 --> 20:48.111
What?

20:48.146 --> 20:50.547
What?

20:50.581 --> 20:53.083
Fuck you.
What?

20:53.117 --> 20:55.452
I'm just...

20:55.486 --> 20:58.921
Maybe tonight, and...

20:58.956 --> 21:01.924
My penis and my shitty weed,

21:01.958 --> 21:04.293
and maybe even wes...

21:04.327 --> 21:08.096
Maybe it is about you and...

21:08.131 --> 21:09.564
All those daddy issues
that are like

21:09.599 --> 21:12.067
a monkey on your fuckin' back.

21:14.737 --> 21:16.671
Monica's not available.

21:16.706 --> 21:18.973
Whoa.

21:19.008 --> 21:21.143
I can't believe... I can't believe
I got your voicemail.

21:21.177 --> 21:23.145
You're unavailable?
Yeah, you are

21:23.179 --> 21:25.014
<i>un-fuckin'-available</i>
darlin'!

21:25.048 --> 21:26.449
Monica's not avail...

21:26.483 --> 21:28.518
Remember you said you were
gonna "be there for him"?

21:28.552 --> 21:30.320
That's awesome.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.424
How you were gonna be there
to get him up and running.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.326
And understanding that shit
that life is...

21:35.361 --> 21:36.761
what was that shit
that you said?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.330
Monica's not available.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.965
You know what... you know what
he understands now?

21:39.999 --> 21:42.433
He understands that
life is <i>unsteady,</i>

21:42.468 --> 21:46.805
and it's full of regret
and fucking recrimination.

21:46.839 --> 21:47.939
That's a good word for you.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.807
You...

21:49.841 --> 21:53.043
You have let...
you've let our son down

21:53.077 --> 21:54.611
'cause you are not there.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.846
There is no <i>there</i> there...

21:56.881 --> 22:00.717
Where there should be
a mother, or a fuckin'...

22:00.751 --> 22:03.753
if you are satisfied
with your message, press one.

22:03.788 --> 22:05.055
To listen to your message...

22:05.089 --> 22:08.826
no, I'm not happy with my
fuckin' message.

22:12.364 --> 22:15.200
So, what's
my best position?

22:15.234 --> 22:17.202
Well, we've looked over
all your documents,

22:17.236 --> 22:18.871
and first, let me say
we are completely on your side.

22:18.905 --> 22:22.074
Yeah.
There is just one issue.

22:23.014 --> 22:24.654
The fraud issue.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.880
What fraud issue?

22:28.914 --> 22:30.348
Two words... back door.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.749
You tried to save your rep

22:31.784 --> 22:33.418
by creating a back door on NKT.

22:33.452 --> 22:34.685
And that's fraud.

22:34.719 --> 22:38.255
And that'll get you pokied
in the pokey.

22:38.289 --> 22:40.190
Okay...

22:40.225 --> 22:42.359
So I mean,
that's not a problem, right?

22:42.393 --> 22:43.994
I mean, you just...
just get rid of it.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.330
Clean it up, right?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.366
I'm... I'm sorry,
is there a joke I missed?

22:48.400 --> 22:51.403
You are a bona fide,
motherfuckin' sellout!

22:51.437 --> 22:53.204
Just like us.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.740
Ask your boy DJ.

22:54.774 --> 22:58.010
First of all, Marty,
I'm nothing like you.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.213
And second of all,
you don't know shit about me.

23:00.247 --> 23:02.749
Really? Well, let's
play the game called

23:02.783 --> 23:04.017
name that fucking sellout!

23:04.051 --> 23:05.518
I don't think that's
an appropriate...

23:05.552 --> 23:07.453
Jeannie, it's a fun game.

23:07.488 --> 23:11.557
Who's obsessed with money,
power... their black card,

23:11.592 --> 23:14.027
and their desire to score
quality pussy?

23:14.061 --> 23:16.629
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
Alex!

23:16.663 --> 23:18.530
That's right, you.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.900
You are the batteries
in the great big dildo

23:20.934 --> 23:23.202
that's fucking this country
in the ass.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.204
Now, we can help you.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.506
We bury bodies every day.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.941
Is that who you want to be?

23:34.114 --> 23:36.015
- What do I do?
- What?

23:36.050 --> 23:37.116
What do I do?

23:37.151 --> 23:38.718
Tell the board
you're stepping down.

23:38.752 --> 23:41.253
Pull a bill gates.
You won't lose your ownership.

23:41.288 --> 23:43.822
You'll just let them handle
the corporate shit.

23:43.857 --> 23:46.091
And just lay low
and get back to working

23:46.126 --> 23:47.926
that Katsnelson magic

23:47.961 --> 23:50.328
writing code for NKT 2.0.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.563
This time with no back door.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.231
We'll offer free upgrades
to all of your clients.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.500
We will clean up
this entire thing

23:56.534 --> 23:59.169
and let you get back to being
who you really are.

23:59.203 --> 24:01.805
All right, well, what about
the international expansion?

24:01.840 --> 24:03.374
The what?

24:03.408 --> 24:05.409
Yeah, that does ring a bell.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.811
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:06.845 --> 24:08.379
They're gonna... the board's
gonna fuck this up!

24:08.413 --> 24:09.480
Of course they're gonna
fuck it up.

24:09.514 --> 24:10.681
- No, you're gonna get fucked.
- Yeah.

24:10.716 --> 24:13.351
- It's gonna be worst than that.
- Wait.

24:13.386 --> 24:14.586
And this is just an idea.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.054
Brainstorm.
Throw it out. Yeah.

24:16.089 --> 24:17.756
- Bring it. Bring it.
- You've got a solution.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.124
What if you guys stayed on
as my consultants?

24:19.159 --> 24:21.694
You know, be my eyes and ears.

24:21.728 --> 24:22.828
Just name the price.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.196
- I mean...
- Yeah, I don't know...

24:25.231 --> 24:27.599
I mean...
Not that we don't want to.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.701
- I'm looking at the numbers...
- Those things.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.302
A lot of blue
on this page, and...

24:31.336 --> 24:34.838
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

24:34.872 --> 24:36.807
- Marty, you got to be kidding.
- No, let me...

24:36.841 --> 24:39.142
we got Utah, and then we got...

24:39.177 --> 24:41.945
You know what?
I think we can do it.

24:41.979 --> 24:43.980
- Marty, are you nuts?
- I think we can do it.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.350
I've never seen him
do that before.

24:46.384 --> 24:48.352
- Yes.
- You got a team, Alex.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.094
You hear that?

24:55.128 --> 24:57.397
Sucking sounds?

24:57.431 --> 25:00.801
He has latched himself
on to Galweather's massive tits,

25:00.835 --> 25:02.670
and he thinks it's his idea.

25:02.704 --> 25:05.239
This is what we call
a good day.

25:05.273 --> 25:08.642
Suck, motherfucker, suck!

25:08.677 --> 25:10.711
You can trust us, Alex.

25:10.746 --> 25:13.047
So you guys on Facebook?

25:13.081 --> 25:14.782
- No. MySpace.
- What's MySpace?

25:14.816 --> 25:15.917
Did you delete
your friendster account?

25:15.951 --> 25:17.518
No, I kept it open for my band.

25:17.553 --> 25:20.488
- He's a good kid.
- Yeah, he's pretty all right.

25:20.523 --> 25:21.522
A word of advice.

25:21.557 --> 25:23.958
Figure out a way
to talk to him now

25:23.992 --> 25:25.793
before he starts talking
about you

25:25.828 --> 25:27.495
on some therapist's couch.

25:27.530 --> 25:29.730
Do I smell daddy issues?

25:29.764 --> 25:32.366
Now, that would be cliche.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.867
Yes.

25:33.902 --> 25:35.836
- I have a...
- What's up?

25:35.870 --> 25:38.539
Just a rock in my show.
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:38.573 --> 25:39.740
All right.

25:39.774 --> 25:41.275
Talk with him about it.

25:41.310 --> 25:42.943
I will. Okay.

25:42.977 --> 25:44.511
- Okay, see ya.
- All right. Bye.

25:47.482 --> 25:51.544
So granddad's gonna have to stay
another night down there.

25:54.263 --> 25:58.300
Hey, let's talk about
what's going on at school.

26:00.195 --> 26:02.262
I mean, I know you don't want me
to call principal Gita.

26:02.297 --> 26:04.665
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

26:04.700 --> 26:08.102
Okay.

26:08.136 --> 26:09.737
No, we got to talk
about it, Roscoe.

26:09.772 --> 26:13.274
Those kids are just jealous
of my awesome.

26:13.309 --> 26:14.476
That's what Doug thinks.

26:14.510 --> 26:16.778
You talked to Doug.

26:16.812 --> 26:19.514
Yeah.

26:19.790 --> 26:22.766
Listen, buddy...

26:23.653 --> 26:26.354
I know we don't get
a lot of time together,

26:26.389 --> 26:28.789
and this week was supposed
to be different.

26:28.824 --> 26:31.893
Sometimes I...

26:31.927 --> 26:33.762
I get into...

26:33.796 --> 26:35.997
- Dad?
- I don't know.

26:36.031 --> 26:40.635
Dad...
Best week ever.

26:45.408 --> 26:48.776
Okay.

26:54.783 --> 26:56.084
Hey, you.

26:56.118 --> 26:58.920
I thought I'd wait
and surprise you.

26:58.954 --> 27:02.356
So... surprise.

27:02.390 --> 27:04.725
I'm a lucky guy.

27:04.759 --> 27:08.495
I think we should have
the engagement party.

27:08.530 --> 27:10.497
Just not work people,

27:10.531 --> 27:13.399
because it's gonna be hard
enough wrangling your mother.

27:13.434 --> 27:15.769
All right.
Well, let's go home, baby.

27:15.803 --> 27:17.503
Good. I'm tired.

27:17.538 --> 27:20.173
All right.
Me too.
