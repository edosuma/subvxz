Good evening, New Yorkers,

00:07.274 --> 00:09.710
and welcome to
Channel 8 News, Live at 7.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.313
-I'm Ted Spinelli.
-And I'm Lisa Lipton.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.515
A big day in news
across the city,

00:14.548 --> 00:16.450
but we begin in Staten Island,

00:16.483 --> 00:19.086
where a water main break in the
West New Brighton neighborhood

00:19.119 --> 00:21.589
left the streets looking
more like rivers.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.224
Joanna Roscoe is live
from Staten Island now.

00:24.257 --> 00:25.593
That's right, Lisa.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.095
This was the scene
just hours ago

00:28.128 --> 00:31.732
on what is usually considered
a quiet residential street.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.601
Now, as you can see behind me,

00:33.634 --> 00:35.569
city workers have
managed to stop

00:35.602 --> 00:37.271
the street-level flooding,

00:37.304 --> 00:40.174
but underground flooding
still remains a concern.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.742
Oh, boy. That means
a messy commute home

00:41.775 --> 00:43.777
for a few Staten Islanders,
right, Joanna?

00:43.810 --> 00:45.212
Yeah, it sure does.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.747
Now I am here with
a local resident

00:46.780 --> 00:49.283
who has been watching
the situation closely.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.718
His name is Nandor...

00:50.751 --> 00:52.686
Nandor the Relentless.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.488
Nandor De Laurentis.

00:54.521 --> 00:57.191
Now, Nandor, you live in
this neighborhood, correct?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.159
Yes, that's right, Joanna, I do.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.761
In that house just over there.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.397
With my friends. It's fun.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.132
Great.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.301
And as I understand,
you were on the street

01:07.334 --> 01:09.069
when the water main broke.
Can you tell us about that?

01:09.102 --> 01:10.337
[Nandor]
Yes, I can, Joanna.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.373
I was going
for my evening stroll,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.141
which I do for my mental health

01:14.174 --> 01:16.043
as well as for
my physical health,

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
and then,
all of a sudden, crash!

01:18.111 --> 01:20.414
Burst!

01:20.447 --> 01:21.782
Water, it shoots

01:21.815 --> 01:23.584
into the air, and then, like,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.386
all over the street.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.687
[Joanna] Now, Nandor,
have you seen an incident

01:26.720 --> 01:29.123
in this area like this before?

01:29.156 --> 01:32.393
Not since the great
flood in 1892, Joanna.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.194
That was a big boy.

01:34.227 --> 01:35.796
[chuckles] 1892.

01:35.829 --> 01:39.700
Oh, silly me. Not... not 1892.

01:39.733 --> 01:43.037
-[laughs]
-1992.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.773
Yeah, I was gonna say, uh, 1892?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.509
Give me this guy's
skin care secrets.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.478
Because 1892 was
a year that was not

01:51.511 --> 01:53.447
in my, uh, human lifespan,

01:53.480 --> 01:56.584
but 1992 most definitely was.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.552
It's 2023 now...

01:58.585 --> 02:01.121
-Right.
-...and it was 1992 then.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.656
And I have been living
in Staten Island

02:02.689 --> 02:04.258
for many centuries.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.593
Many centuries.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.629
Well, it looks like
we have discovered

02:08.662 --> 02:11.465
the secret to eternal life.

02:11.498 --> 02:14.134
-Now, I do have a...
-[whimpers, mutters]

02:14.167 --> 02:17.238
Well, Ted and Lisa,
I will be here,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.540
on the ground,
monitoring the situation

02:19.573 --> 02:21.575
as it develops. Back to you.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.745
Oh, shitty shit. I fucked it.

This is go...

03:16.863 --> 03:18.332
[Joanna]
But there is some worry that...

03:18.365 --> 03:19.733
-Huh.
-[Nandor groans]

03:19.766 --> 03:21.569
That's our street. Huh.
Well, that's neat.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.037
That is not neat.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.438
I may have committed

03:24.471 --> 03:27.441
an unforgivable
and irreversible blunder.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.743
Okay, Nandor, don't get
your knickers in a twist.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.146
I-I accidentally told
this Joanna Roscoe

03:32.179 --> 03:35.282
that we have lived in this
street for many centuries.

03:35.315 --> 03:36.550
-[gasps]
-You did what?

03:36.583 --> 03:39.086
And now she and
all of the viewers

03:39.119 --> 03:41.322
of Channel 8 News Live at 7

03:41.355 --> 03:43.490
know that we are vampires.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.125
-[shouting]
-And now--

03:45.158 --> 03:46.694
And now all of the humans
are going to

03:46.727 --> 03:48.295
drive us out of Staten Island

03:48.328 --> 03:49.463
like they drove us
out of the Old Country.

Alea iacta est.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.567

-[plays piano sting]

03:53.600 --> 03:55.736
No, no!

03:55.769 --> 03:57.271
This time, we fight!

03:57.304 --> 03:59.472
This is our last stand!

04:00.807 --> 04:02.676
-Who's with me?
-Me!

04:04.244 --> 04:05.813
Silence!

04:05.846 --> 04:07.615
I have a plan.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.584
I think we should
kill Joanna Roscoe.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.320
And what would that solve?

04:13.353 --> 04:15.255
Do you have any better ideas?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.158
Where is Guillermo?!

04:18.191 --> 04:19.526
[dings]

04:19.559 --> 04:22.229
So, yeah, tonight's kind of
a farewell,

04:22.262 --> 04:23.731
goodbye dinner
for me and my mom.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.332
She doesn't know
that it's a goodbye,

04:25.365 --> 04:27.101
but when I become
a full vampire,

04:27.134 --> 04:28.402
it won't be safe for my family,

04:28.435 --> 04:30.571
or for me because

04:30.604 --> 04:32.806
they are vampire killers,

04:32.839 --> 04:34.742
and I'll be a vampire.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.243
[sighs] It's kind of heavy,
actually,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.579
if you think about it.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.247
No one imagines
they'll have to say

04:40.280 --> 04:42.182
a final goodbye
to their mom, but...

04:42.215 --> 04:44.151
here we are.

-Mami.

Wait, you didn't bring a gift
for your own mama's birthday?

So, funny thing.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.149

05:15.182 --> 05:17.051
making it a big day about me,

05:17.084 --> 05:20.387
I totally forgot that
it's a big day for her.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.556
It's her birthday,

05:22.589 --> 05:25.192

[Ted]
Apologies to Joanna
and Mr. De Laurentis,

06:01.428 --> 06:04.064
but we have some breaking news.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.499
The National Weather Service
has announced

06:05.532 --> 06:07.701
a severe thunderstorm
warning for the city.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.070
We now go to meteorologist

answer the fucking phone.

-Should I answer that?
-[Laszlo] Announcement.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.206
After methodical analysis,
I have decided

06:46.239 --> 06:47.575
that it is not a good idea

06:47.608 --> 06:49.643
to kill Joanna Roscoe.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.245
No shit, you human fart.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.113
Now, help me
booby-trap the staircase.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.582
Maybe I should just
take it off the hook?

Hello?

06:55.515 --> 06:57.217
[line beeping]

06:57.250 --> 06:59.320

not the time for decorating.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.654
Get your fucking go-bag.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.091
be prepared to skip out of town

07:04.124 --> 07:05.593
at a moment's notice.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.761
I have been chased out
of five, maybe six

07:07.794 --> 07:09.530
villages over the course
of my vampiric life,

07:09.563 --> 07:11.599
and believe me,
you don't want to be

07:11.632 --> 07:14.235
caught out there fleeing with
only the clothes on your back,

07:14.268 --> 07:16.437
sleeping at the bottom
of a cold well,

07:16.470 --> 07:18.072
sucking on the throats
of the mountain goats

07:18.105 --> 07:19.340
you once called your brothers.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.709
No. So, what was
the first thing I did

07:21.742 --> 07:23.077
when I moved to Staten Island?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.511
I made the go-bags.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.214
[Laszlo]
I have decided on
a multi-part plan.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.315
The first part of which:

07:28.348 --> 07:30.718
Kidnap Joanna Roscoe.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.086
And how is that going to help?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.487
Takes us to step two.

-[bees buzzing]
-[Nadja groans] Everybody,

07:35.389 --> 07:37.224
in your go-bags you will find

your emergency
fleeing checklist.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.227
Okay.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.762
"Ancestral soils."

07:41.795 --> 07:42.796
Check.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.232
"Three days' supply of blood."

07:45.265 --> 07:46.500

A little bit rank, but check.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.305
"Memorize new identity."

every year at the county fair."

-Don't sit there.
-Why not?

08:02.649 --> 08:04.017
Because.

-[gasps]
-The whole ground floor
is booby-trapped

08:09.523 --> 08:11.058
Oh, yes, because the attackers
first thing they will do

08:11.091 --> 08:12.526
is come down and
take a nice rest.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.628
I think you're all
wasting valuable time.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.764
-Thank you.
-What you need to do

08:16.797 --> 08:18.365
is get a kidnapping sack.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.767
No, you need to get your go-bag.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.468
And you need to trust the plan.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.604
-Get your go-bag.
-Trust the plan.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.173
-Get your go-bag.
-Trust...

to have your argument

chandelier fall zone.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.346
-Also, mind the trip wire.
-[Laszlo] Fucking hell.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.248
[pounding on door]

08:34.281 --> 08:35.749
-Places, places!
-It's all right.
It's all right, my darling.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.451
-I'll protect you.
-[pounding]

08:37.484 --> 08:39.386
-This is it.
This is our final stand.
-Be calm.

08:39.419 --> 08:42.356
Would you stop fucking
saying that, Colin Robinson?

08:42.389 --> 08:43.657
[Laszlo]
Step back, my darling.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.625
-[door crashes]
-Friends, fear not.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.063
I went back to
Channel 8 News Live at 7

08:49.096 --> 08:50.631
and hypnotized
the audience, so...

08:50.664 --> 08:52.266
We saw.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.735
And no, you did not
hypnotize anyone, Nandor.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.437
Those television humans

08:56.470 --> 08:57.471
interrupted your blather
with a warning of a storm.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.074
This is all Guillermo's fault!

09:00.107 --> 09:02.443
-He's not back yet, is he?
-[Laszlo] No.

09:02.476 --> 09:05.112
Also, why is your
hair yellow, Nadja?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.247
-I am not Nadja.
-Oh.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.514
I am Sally Rhubarb.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.083
There is only
one way out of this:

09:09.116 --> 09:11.719
We must kill Joanna Roscoe.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.221
[Laszlo]
Which were my thoughts exactly,

09:14.254 --> 09:15.623
but if you follow "Arrow F,"

09:15.656 --> 09:17.758
you'll find a far more
sophisticated plan.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.793
"Kidnap Joanna Roscoe"?

09:19.826 --> 09:21.495
Which is step one of the plan.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.064
-And then what?
-Step two.

09:24.999 --> 09:28.102
Welcome back to
Channel 8 News, Live at 7.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.604
We'll check in with
Joanna Roscoe, but first...

09:30.637 --> 09:32.473
[Miguel]
And then I saw that diesel
was as cheap as gas.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.108
So I took it back to
the rent-a-car spot

09:34.141 --> 09:35.609
and say, "Hey, homie,
how am I supposed to know

09:35.642 --> 09:37.211
-Corollas don't take diesel?"
-[line beeping]

09:37.244 --> 09:39.046
Guillermo?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.614
-Are you okay?
-[Miguel] You know what?

09:40.647 --> 09:42.249
He doesn't listen, all right?
Don't even bother.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.052
-I'm listening.
-[speaks Spanish]

09:45.085 --> 09:46.487
That's what it is. The screens.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.088
You need to cut
that shit off, cold turkey.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.623
Just like I did with
the Sierra Mist, huh, Ma?

09:49.656 --> 09:52.393
Guillermo, you're working
too much. It's not healthy.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.627
[Miguel]
You need to be
healthy like I am.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.062
No Sierra Mist,

09:55.095 --> 09:56.764
no whack bosses.
I told my last boss,

09:56.797 --> 09:58.532
"Hey, jefe, you want to try
to ruin my life like that?

09:58.565 --> 10:00.401
Boom. Toma."

10:00.434 --> 10:01.735
[speaks Spanish]

10:01.768 --> 10:03.203
But, you know,
you're probably too scared

10:03.236 --> 10:04.605
-to do that.
-I'm not scared, Miguel.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.241
I'm not scared.
I recently made a big move.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.045
My old boss kept
promising me a promotion,

10:11.078 --> 10:12.212
and I got tired of waiting.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.614
-[woman] Wow.
-[cheering]

10:13.647 --> 10:15.215
Yeah, yeah.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.350
So I'm here.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.319
[woman speaking Spanish]

10:18.352 --> 10:19.587
-Are you here, though?
-Yeah, I'm here.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.188
Why are you still
all on your phone, then?

10:21.221 --> 10:22.623
Because, it's the transition.
I haven't...

10:22.656 --> 10:24.458
officially left
the old railroad,

10:24.491 --> 10:27.361
and, uh, haven't
officially started

10:27.394 --> 10:29.129
-the new one.
-How many railroads
even are there?

10:29.162 --> 10:32.099
Let's just eat, huh?
Why don't we all just eat?

10:32.132 --> 10:35.603
[Guide]
I do not have a name
in the traditional sense.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.605
[Joanna]
And you said that you
work for the city...

10:37.638 --> 10:41.242
[speaking Spanish]

10:41.275 --> 10:42.610
Right, Joanna Roscoe.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.211
There will be damage.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.447
Bloodshed, too.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.350
This is why I propose a truce.

10:49.383 --> 10:52.219
Because we are not so
different, you and us.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.755
We all want peace.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.390
-[Sean] Yello?
-Hey, Sean,

10:56.423 --> 10:58.192
this is Guillermo
from next door.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.328
Yo, Guillermo. How's it goin'?
What can I do for you?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.230
Yeah, I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.466
If you can go next door
and tell the vam...

11:05.499 --> 11:08.335
Uh, Laszlo and Nadja
and everyone at the house

11:08.368 --> 11:09.737
if they could just,
can they stay

11:09.770 --> 11:11.505
inside the house
and just stay put

11:11.538 --> 11:13.340
until I get there? Could you
do that for me, please?

11:13.373 --> 11:14.775
[Sean]
That's gonna be a little tricky.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.311
There's been a water main break
on our street,

11:17.344 --> 11:20.114
[shouting]
and these TV fuckers
parked their van

11:20.147 --> 11:22.349
-right on the front lawn...
-And someone else is here.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.051
-...which I just
resodded last year.
-Sean? What are you doing?

11:24.084 --> 11:25.786
The territory of Staten Island

11:25.819 --> 11:29.757
can, nay, must be shared
between our people...

11:29.790 --> 11:32.459
Looks like there's a lot of
excitement over there.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.328
Speaking of excitement,

11:34.361 --> 11:37.197
you'll never guess what this
Bronx seventh grader is doing

11:37.230 --> 11:39.400
to raise money
for the rainforest.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.569
[woman speaking Spanish]

11:41.602 --> 11:43.370
[Laszlo]
A nine-step plan!

11:43.403 --> 11:46.073
-Make sure it's bloody
straight, you idiot.
-Yes.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.475
Reason and diplomacy
did not work,

11:48.508 --> 11:49.610
as you all saw.

11:49.643 --> 11:52.579
So let us do it. Let us flee.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.083
-Us?
-Yes.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.484
And if they won't go,

11:57.517 --> 12:00.054
then it will be just you
and I, into the night.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.790
Um, okay. C-Cool.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.058
I shall go prepare my disguise.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.096
-[line beeping]
-[laughter, chatter]

12:09.129 --> 12:11.231
So, bad news.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.767
There's been an emergency
with, uh, a train.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.369
So I'm gonna have to head out.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.204
[speaks Spanish]
I called it, didn't I?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.573
Mami? Mami, can we just
have that talk really quick,

12:19.606 --> 12:21.242
-the one I was
telling you about?
-[speaks Spanish]

12:21.275 --> 12:22.610
Gracias. Por favor.

12:22.643 --> 12:24.111
[Laszlo]
Hello?

12:24.144 --> 12:26.347
-Laszlo? Laszlo.
-Who is this?

12:26.380 --> 12:27.748
Sorry, Mom. Por favor.

12:27.781 --> 12:28.782
What do you mean,
"who is it"? It's Guillermo.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.351
Oh, Gizmo. What do you want?

12:30.384 --> 12:31.585
What the hell's
going on over there?

12:31.618 --> 12:33.087
[Laszlo]
Can't talk right now.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.321
To cut a shit story short,

12:34.354 --> 12:35.489
-we've been found out.
-Huh?

12:35.522 --> 12:37.224
The whole world knows

12:37.257 --> 12:39.627
that vampires are real
and that we are they.

12:39.660 --> 12:41.195
Okay, Laszlo,
just do me a favor.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.263
Just stay put, okay?
I'll be over soon.

12:42.296 --> 12:43.631
Don't you tell me what to do.

12:43.664 --> 12:45.232
-[Nandor] Laszlo?
-I have con...

12:45.265 --> 12:47.034
[Guillermo]
Laszlo?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.502
-That's too small, you prick.
-Who's there with you?

12:48.535 --> 12:50.304
-You think?
-Just stay put, okay?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.706
We have to get Joanna Roscoe's
entire body in there.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.775
-No. What are you...
-[Laszlo] We need to get
a grown woman in there.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.210
What are you...
What are you doing?

12:56.243 --> 12:57.478
I think this bag is big enough.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.380
-All right, well, get in it.
-Laszlo?

12:59.413 --> 13:01.081
-Okay.
-What's going on? Laszlo?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.217
-Oy vey. Too small.
-Too fucking small.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.486
-If we are to
kidnap Joanna Roscoe,
-No!

13:05.519 --> 13:07.454
-we need a sack large enough
for her entire body.
-Beep, beep.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.491
Now, don't phone here again.
We are incredibly busy.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.192
-Do not kidnap...
-We don't need to be distracted.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.361
Gizmo? Huh.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.364
Blasted boy, hung up on me.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.732
Fucking hell, Nandor.
Get a bigger sack.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.600
Laszlo?

13:24.071 --> 13:25.306
-I found one!

13:25.339 --> 13:26.574
This is a very big bag.

13:26.607 --> 13:28.676
I tried it already. I fit.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.077
It's translucent.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.478
We could add a blindfold?

13:31.511 --> 13:32.479
Yes, but it would add time.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.614
Is anybody listening to me?

13:33.647 --> 13:37.050
You need to get your go-bags!

13:38.652 --> 13:40.153
-Mami?
-Mm-hmm?

14:29.169 --> 14:30.170
No.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.540
No...

14:41.481 --> 14:43.717
[sizzling]

14:48.522 --> 14:52.158
[speaking Spanish]

14:53.760 --> 14:55.262
[sizzling]

15:05.639 --> 15:06.706
[elevator dings]

15:13.213 --> 15:14.381
[sniffling]

15:18.585 --> 15:20.186
[elevator dings]

15:23.590 --> 15:25.392
How's it going?

15:27.761 --> 15:29.696
It was like this
when I got here.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.702
[Nadja]
So, this is it, then?
This is really goodbye,

15:34.735 --> 15:36.537
my agápi mou.

15:36.570 --> 15:38.806
I'm afraid so, my mátia mou.

15:38.839 --> 15:40.574
I must see my plan through.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.610
It has many steps.

15:42.643 --> 15:44.078
-[Guide] Ready!
-Oh!

15:44.111 --> 15:45.446
Oh.

15:45.479 --> 15:47.081
So, when the villagers
who are chasing us

15:47.114 --> 15:48.315
say they are looking for
a blonde and a brunette...

15:49.616 --> 15:51.819
Well, I guess I didn't
really think it through.

15:51.852 --> 15:54.154
Housemates.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.289
Friends.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.323
The Guide.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.191
A great enemy is upon us.

15:59.059 --> 16:03.230
Joanna Roscoe and her army
of Channel 8 viewers.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.832
This is not
the first foe we have met,

16:04.865 --> 16:06.767
nor will it be the last.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.036
They may outnumber us,

16:09.069 --> 16:12.039
they may have a satellite truck

16:12.072 --> 16:15.476
and a Sky High chopper,
whatever the fuck,

16:15.509 --> 16:17.311
but what do we have?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.346
-Kidnapping sack.
-Go-bags!
-The skull of Orson Welles.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.481
Each other.

16:20.514 --> 16:22.149
-Oh.
-Oh.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.051
Look at us, running around,
this way and that,

16:24.084 --> 16:26.086
focusing on our own plans.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.688
We all have
a part to play in this,

16:27.721 --> 16:29.356
and play it we must,

16:29.389 --> 16:31.592
-but together.
-Hear, hear.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.160
-Thank you, Laszlo.
-Now, get the fuck on with it

16:33.193 --> 16:35.362
Yes, this is all
your fault, you know.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.099
For this shithole on
Staten Island is our home,

16:39.132 --> 16:40.601
and 30 years from now,

16:40.634 --> 16:42.136
when you, Nadja,

16:42.169 --> 16:43.604
are sat there by that fireplace

16:43.637 --> 16:46.073
and you have a little ghost
dolly on your knee,

16:46.106 --> 16:48.208
and she looks up at you,
and she says,

16:48.241 --> 16:51.412
"What did you do during
the great vampire battle?"

16:51.445 --> 16:53.614
Maybe you won't
need to say to her,

16:53.647 --> 16:57.217
"Me, dolly? I was shoveling
shit in Louisiana."

16:57.250 --> 16:59.153
-I would never do that.
-[door opens]

16:59.186 --> 17:00.487
Okay, you guys, I'm back.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.724
No need to worry 'cause
I have a plan...

17:03.757 --> 17:05.159
[shouts]

17:05.192 --> 17:06.560
-[Nandor] Whoa.
-[Laszlo] Shit!

17:06.593 --> 17:08.095
[Nadja]
For crying out loud.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.229
[chuckles]

17:09.262 --> 17:10.497
[groans]

17:10.530 --> 17:12.099
[Nandor]
We are fine, Guillermo.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.300
In fact, we are better
than fine. We are great.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.202
We have our own plan.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.303
Okay, I'm just trying
to help cal--

17:16.336 --> 17:18.405
Nadja, when did you go blonde?

17:18.438 --> 17:19.473
I mean, you look really--

17:19.506 --> 17:20.741
I don't have time to tell you

17:20.774 --> 17:22.309
everything that you've
missed, traitor.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.211
Look, I know I haven't
been around, but--

17:24.244 --> 17:26.146
It's fine. I get it.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.215
You have your life
and we have ours.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.483
And if tonight
has taught us nothing else,

17:29.516 --> 17:30.751
then it has taught us this:

17:30.784 --> 17:34.454
We can survive
quite easily without you.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.426
Well, okay, then.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.195
Wait, what?

17:41.228 --> 17:42.329
You seem to have everything
under control,

17:42.362 --> 17:44.431
so good luck.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.433
I wouldn't go that way
if I were you.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.602
-Why not?
-Ever hear of a Bouncing Betty?

17:48.635 --> 17:51.671
A schrapnellmine
in the authentic German?

17:56.643 --> 18:00.547
[Heather]
Our latest model is now showing
that those mild showers

18:00.580 --> 18:01.815
won't be hitting
the five boroughs

18:01.848 --> 18:04.418
until 4:00 a.m. at the earliest.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.486
[Lisa]
All right, that's
great news. Still time

18:05.519 --> 18:07.187
to pull in that lawn furniture.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.156
[Ted] And speaking
of unexpected waters,

18:09.189 --> 18:10.190
Joanna Roscoe is back

18:10.223 --> 18:11.692
with an update for us

18:11.725 --> 18:13.427
on that Staten Island
water main break.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.195
What's it looking like, Joanna?

18:15.228 --> 18:18.432
Hi, Ted. I am happy to report

18:18.465 --> 18:19.733
that this story finally has

18:19.766 --> 18:21.302
a happy ending.

18:21.335 --> 18:23.203
The water main has been sealed,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.606
and the underground leaks
have been brought

18:25.639 --> 18:26.740
under control.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.576
Now there is a small sinkhole,

18:28.609 --> 18:30.311
but the area
has been cordoned off

18:30.344 --> 18:32.713
to prevent it from
widening any further

18:32.746 --> 18:34.682
until we can get
a street crew out here

18:34.715 --> 18:37.051
to fill it in the morning,
but, hey,

18:37.084 --> 18:39.286
at the risk of sounding
overly optimistic,

18:39.319 --> 18:41.221
it looks like residents
are on their way

18:41.254 --> 18:44.291
to having their street
back any moment now. I...

18:44.324 --> 18:46.060
[Nandor]
Wait. Wait!

18:46.093 --> 18:47.494
Kevin, you got this?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.229
Looks like this story
is not quite over yet.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.499
A very odd and dangerous
new development happening here.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.335
-Whoa, whoa whoa--
-Shit!

18:54.368 --> 18:55.736
[Nadja]
Fucking idiots!

18:55.769 --> 18:57.204
[Joanna] An antique car
has rolled into

18:57.237 --> 19:00.341
the sinkhole,
and a group of locals

19:00.374 --> 19:02.343
are now working together
to retrieve it.

19:02.376 --> 19:04.345
[Laszlo]
Initiate diversion,
Colin Robinson.

19:04.378 --> 19:06.180
Initiate diversion.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.415
[Joanna]
All right, there's a guy,
and, uh,

19:08.448 --> 19:10.417
he doesn't work for us.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.419
Okay, and he's throwing
fire in the van. Kev?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.623
[Joanna] Oh! Holy fuck.

19:15.656 --> 19:18.092
[flat tone]

19:18.125 --> 19:20.060
Nope, not my problem.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.329
[Lisa]
All right, uh,
apologies to our viewers,

19:22.362 --> 19:25.366
but it appears we have
lost our Staten Island feed.

19:25.399 --> 19:27.268
[Ted]
We are working
to contact our team

19:27.301 --> 19:29.436
to make sure everything is okay.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.738
Whoa.

19:30.771 --> 19:32.105
[laughs]

19:32.839 --> 19:34.275
[Kevin]
We lost the feed.
We lost it.

19:34.308 --> 19:35.743
Are you getting this?
Are you filming?

19:35.776 --> 19:37.678
[Kevin] Satellite's not
transmitting to studio,

19:37.711 --> 19:38.445
-but I'm recording on the card.
-Get it on the memory card.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.413
Do not stop.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.581
[screams]

19:40.614 --> 19:42.750
What is going on?
Are they flying?!

19:42.783 --> 19:44.351
Oh, oh!

19:44.384 --> 19:45.753
Okay, call the station
and tell them that

19:45.786 --> 19:47.454
-we're coming in
with the footage.
-Okay.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.292
-Excuse me.
-[all] What?

19:51.325 --> 19:54.561
I think Joanna caught us
flying on tape. FYI.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.163
We need to follow that tape

19:56.196 --> 19:58.832
and steal that tape
and destroy that tape.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.069
[Laszlo]
Absolutely, continue with
the second part of the plan.

20:02.102 --> 20:03.571
This sounds like
a slightly different plan.

20:03.604 --> 20:05.639
No, it's the same plan. Bat!

20:07.074 --> 20:09.143
[bats squeaking]

20:09.176 --> 20:10.644
Assholes!

20:15.549 --> 20:17.251
Apologies, for the technical
diffic

20:17.284 --> 20:19.620
but I hear we have some
truly inexplicable footage

20:19.653 --> 20:21.355
from Joanna en route.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.723
-[objects clattering]
-[shouting]

20:22.756 --> 20:24.358
[Colin]
Hand it over, camera jockey.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.693
[Laszlo] Show yourself,
Joanna Roscoe.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.161
[Colin]
I got Joanna's camera!

20:27.194 --> 20:29.530
Ladies and gentlemen,
one moment.

20:29.563 --> 20:32.199
Bit of confusion here in studio.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.168
[Ted]
I'll say. Who are you people?

20:34.201 --> 20:36.036
What are you doing in here?
This is a closed set...

20:36.069 --> 20:39.340
[Nandor] You will fall asleep
and forget everything

20:39.373 --> 20:41.174
that has happened here tonight.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.544
And then fall off your chair.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.145
What about all the people

20:45.178 --> 20:46.380
who just saw Lisa Lipton

20:46.413 --> 20:48.048
and Ted Spinelli get hypnotized?

20:48.081 --> 20:49.717
[Nadja] We go on
and hypnotize them, too?

20:49.750 --> 20:51.718
[Nandor]
Yes, good idea.

20:53.053 --> 20:57.224
[quivering voice] To all of the
viewers of the Channel 8 News,

20:57.257 --> 20:59.360
you will remember nothing

20:59.393 --> 21:02.596
out of the ordinary tonight.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.064
[Nandor] That is all ye know,

21:04.097 --> 21:06.233
and all ye need to know.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.436
Actually, pretty solid solution.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.038
Should we just leave now?

21:11.071 --> 21:12.740
No, that will
look very suspicious

21:12.773 --> 21:14.808
to the humans
that have just tuned in.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.543
Just read the words
on the screen.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.345
Uh...

21:20.814 --> 21:23.050
Hip-hip pup-rade.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.119
Indeed. It is time again

21:25.152 --> 21:27.321
for Staten Island's
annual puppy parade.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.723
Which is always
a barking good time.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.192
Here's hoping we have
some nice weather

21:32.225 --> 21:34.695
for these promenading pooches.

21:34.728 --> 21:37.531
And now,
let's turn it over to...

21:37.564 --> 21:39.566
Colin Robinson with the weather.

21:39.599 --> 21:43.070
Seems like a wet one
out there tonight,

21:43.103 --> 21:44.371
right, Colin Robinson?

21:44.404 --> 21:45.539
Not as wet

21:45.572 --> 21:47.207
as it could have been,
Nadja,

21:47.240 --> 21:48.709
but still,
no fun for anyone

21:48.742 --> 21:51.245
who forgot
their umbrella at home.

21:51.278 --> 21:52.279
Let's take a look at

21:52.312 --> 21:53.380
the News 8 WeatherWall

21:53.413 --> 21:55.549
with high Doppler action.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.685
And this patch right here,

21:57.718 --> 22:00.387
um... well, that's

22:00.420 --> 22:03.557
a little schmutz there
on the old WeatherWall

22:03.590 --> 22:06.260
with high Doppler action.

22:06.293 --> 22:09.563
But this patch up here,
this is a bit of good news.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.799
New Yorkers,
you can rest easy tonight

22:11.832 --> 22:14.602
and enjoy a little
sunshine this weekend.

22:14.635 --> 22:18.038
Perfect weather
for a puppy parade.

22:18.071 --> 22:21.575
Our four-legged friends will
certainly be happy to hear that.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.245
And now we turn to...

22:24.278 --> 22:26.046
Laszlo Cravensworth,

22:26.079 --> 22:30.184
who better be telling me
my New York football Giants

22:30.217 --> 22:34.688
are raring to go for Sunday's
game against the Cowboys.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.457
Thanks, Nandor.

22:36.490 --> 22:39.126
From your lips to
Coach Daboll's ears.

22:39.159 --> 22:41.262
Big Blue is having
a big season,

22:41.295 --> 22:43.430
but the Cowboys
are on a roll themselves.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.600
So let's just say
that for either team,

22:46.633 --> 22:48.535
the road to a W
is going to be paved

22:48.568 --> 22:51.572
with blood, sweat and tears.

22:51.605 --> 22:54.007
Here's my lovely wife Nadja.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.410
Thank you, my love.

22:56.443 --> 22:59.213
Well, that is it for us
tonight, New York.

22:59.246 --> 23:02.549
And from everyone
at Channel 8 News:

23:02.582 --> 23:03.817
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.319
Goodbye.

23:05.352 --> 23:06.654
Bye, then.

23:06.687 --> 23:09.522
[Laszlo]
That's it, try and look normal.

23:21.335 --> 23:23.170
Well, good.

23:23.203 --> 23:25.639
I don't want anything bad
to happen to them, so...

23:25.672 --> 23:27.608
I guess I always
imagined the hardest part

23:27.641 --> 23:30.411
of being a vampire was
keeping your identity a secret,

23:30.444 --> 23:33.647
but I guess
the hardest part is...

23:33.680 --> 23:36.250
[sighs] who you leave behind.

23:36.283 --> 23:37.818
You know?

23:37.851 --> 23:39.620
The goodbyes.
