00:25.325 --> 00:29.774
He is Colonel Helmut Kruger who ran
an extermination squad at Dachau.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.343
I wonder what Archangel
would want for such a weapon.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.350
It's not getting Kruger out of here

00:39.406 --> 00:41.477
into Israel alive that's troubling you, is it?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.215
It's going up against Archangel.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.214
Fire the missiles!

00:48.282 --> 00:49.659
There's no way to escape.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.855
We got a pair on our tail, closin’ fast.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.954
File A56-7W.
Subject: Airwolf. Top secret.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.226
A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter

02:01.288 --> 02:03.290
with the most advanced
weapons arsenal in the air.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.167
Sought by governments friendly and foreign,

02:06.226 --> 02:08.297
Airwolf is hidden somewhere
in the western wilderness

02:08.362 --> 02:09.966
by its test pilot, Stringfellow Hawke,

02:10.030 --> 02:11.668
to be returned to the US government

02:11.732 --> 02:14.645
only if his brother, Sin Jin,
an MIA in Vietnam, can be found.

02:14.701 --> 02:18.148
The Deputy Director of the Intelligence
Agency that developed Airwolf,

02:18.205 --> 02:19.707
is Michael Goldsmith Briggs III,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.150
codename, Archangel.

02:21.208 --> 02:24.052
Believed to covertly provide
classified information and support

02:24.111 --> 02:25.988
to Hawke in exchange for flying the chopper

02:26.046 --> 02:27.616
on missions of national interest.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.685
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
reclusive, sensitive, and a loner.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.994
Known to associate with his only
friend and mentor, Dominic Santini.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.500
Together, Santini and Hawke fly Airwolf,

02:36.556 --> 02:38.502
capable of speeds rivaling the fastest jets

02:38.558 --> 02:40.469
and backed by unmatched firepower,

02:40.527 --> 02:43.701
Airwolf is a weapon too dangerous
to be left in unenlightened hands.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.539
Finding Airwolf is your 1st priority.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.543
End of file.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.121
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.805
We could have survived for a
week on a square of chocolate

03:15.862 --> 03:17.637
as rich as those, Colonel.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.768
What?

03:18.832 --> 03:21.506
You remember Dachau, don't you, Kruger?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.113
My name is Hans Dauber.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.784
Keep your hands by your sides.

03:32.979 --> 03:35.960
I intend to return you to Israel for trial.

03:36.249 --> 03:39.196
But if I must, I will kill you here and now.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.423
You are making a terrible mistake.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.025
If so, I will apologize.

03:44.357 --> 03:48.066
And the State of Israel will buy
you a new bag of chocolate.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.331
Who are you?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.398
Lebow. Harry Lebow.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.278
But perhaps you know me better as The Dove.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.668
Check oxygen and pressurization.

04:17.724 --> 04:18.998
We're at 4,000 feet.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.663
What have you got against regular air?

04:20.726 --> 04:21.797
We're goin' up.

04:21.862 --> 04:22.932
Oh, how far?

04:22.996 --> 04:24.407
We'll find out.

04:24.464 --> 04:25.670
Oh… oh.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.277
Oxygen and pressure, okay.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.376
Goin' up.

04:34.908 --> 04:35.943
10…

04:37.277 --> 04:38.415
15…

04:39.112 --> 04:40.284
25…

04:40.747 --> 04:42.727
We're at 30,000 already.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.889
I need full power.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.057
Turbos.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.336
50,000…

04:52.726 --> 04:53.898
55…

04:55.929 --> 04:56.999
60…

04:57.297 --> 04:58.799
Am I at full power?

05:00.433 --> 05:01.571
103%

05:05.672 --> 05:06.673
80…

05:08.775 --> 05:10.618
84,000…

05:13.013 --> 05:15.015
Look, it's night-time out.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.052
I need full turbo power.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.090
This thing's almost a spaceship.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.259
She wasn't built to be a spaceship.

05:24.925 --> 05:28.270
We're gonna flounder. 86,000…

05:38.872 --> 05:40.545
84,000…

05:41.074 --> 05:43.315
80… 75…

05:43.443 --> 05:45.719
We gotta get back down to some thicker air.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.692
This cockpit is lit up like Broadway.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.254
Call out when we get to 40,000.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.698
Why?

05:55.755 --> 05:57.428
We use the turbos again then.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.367
Is that the only way to get back control?

05:59.492 --> 06:01.369
Yep, it's the only way.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.240
Comin' down.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.543
50… 48… 45…

06:09.769 --> 06:12.716
comin’ in on 40. 40,000.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.376
- Turbos.
- Turbos.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.382
30…

06:22.916 --> 06:24.054
20…

06:25.252 --> 06:26.196
10…

06:26.253 --> 06:27.789
We're going in, String.

06:29.089 --> 06:33.231
5… 4… 3… 2…

06:37.464 --> 06:38.499
Re-engage rotors.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.669
Re-engage rotors.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.119
Now would you like to tell me why we did that?

06:50.243 --> 06:52.951
We just wanted to see if it could be done.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.136
Yeah, you beauty.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.132
You hit the heights today,
didn't you, sweetheart?

07:47.500 --> 07:48.877
Hey, quiet.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.106
What is it?

07:53.273 --> 07:54.877
Somebody's here.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.547
Your senses

07:58.845 --> 08:01.883
are even more acute than they're
reported to be, Mr. Hawke.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.451
So is my aim. Step into the light.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.054
Of course. Just please remember,

08:07.787 --> 08:11.428
we are in the Valley of the
Gods, not the Valley of Death.

08:13.126 --> 08:18.075
I'm alone. I'm not armed, and
I'm really not very dangerous.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.576
Search her.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.938
Fine.

08:24.971 --> 08:26.973
Uh, well…

08:27.040 --> 08:29.884
Where would you like to begin, Mr. Santini?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.454
Well…

08:31.611 --> 08:32.749
Yes?

08:33.980 --> 08:36.392
Uh, come on.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.164
Who are you?

08:42.389 --> 08:43.868
I'm Sarah Lebow.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.866
How did you get here?

08:45.925 --> 08:47.962
I flew in like a dove.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.634
Well, what is it you want?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.270
I want justice.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.840
Whose?

08:56.903 --> 08:57.847
The Bible's.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.942
Excuse me, my hands are cold.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.083
I've never been big on
meting out biblical justice.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.787
That's all right. The State of
Israel will do that for you.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.625
But I need you, and your machine here,

09:12.685 --> 09:15.222
to bring a sadistic killer to trial.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.193
Oh, and you too, of course, Mr. Santini,

09:19.259 --> 09:22.138
I… I'd be most happy if
you would also come along.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.503
Oh, thank you.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.544
And just where is it that you are
welcoming me to go along to?

09:26.599 --> 09:28.044
To Paraguay.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.973
That's where Helmut Kruger is hiding.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.218
Never heard of him.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.413
Perhaps the name Hans Dauber?

09:36.476 --> 09:38.080
Yeah, I heard of him.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.556
He supplies half the Third World with arms.

09:40.613 --> 09:43.651
Yes, but he is also Colonel Helmut Kruger

09:44.084 --> 09:46.894
who ran an extermination squad at Dachau.

09:46.986 --> 09:50.024
Whoever he is, kidnapping a
man from a neutral country

09:50.090 --> 09:52.366
is not my normal line of business.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.769
It was my Father's line of business

09:54.828 --> 09:57.240
until Helmut Kruger killed him.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.539
Sorry.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.277
That's all right.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.611
I'm not here for your sympathy.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.914
Excuse me, but, why us?

10:08.475 --> 10:12.651
I mean, there are hundreds of bounty
hunters out there you could use.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.421
Look, Kruger literally lives in a fortress.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.463
He is well-armed, he is well-protected,

10:18.518 --> 10:20.464
and the government does nothing.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.727
I need Airwolf. I need Airwolf

10:22.856 --> 10:25.063
to get me in there and to bring him out.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.096
How do you even know about it?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.971
I guess I am my Father's daughter.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.409
I've been his researcher ever since
he discovered that I could type.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.847
Together we brought… we brought
23 Nazi war criminals to trial.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.281
And how many of them
did you personally capture?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.416
None.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.723
That's what I thought. Come on,

10:49.949 --> 10:51.587
we’ll go get Airwolf another lair.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.393
No, please wait. Look, I found Airwolf.

10:54.954 --> 10:58.231
Perhaps I can help you find
your brother, Sin Jin.

11:02.228 --> 11:06.301
Yeah, I knew Harry Lebow, codename, The Dove.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.577
I liked him.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.548
He was, killed in Paris 3 months ago.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.208
What killed him?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.888
A 6-inch blade and a lifestyle.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.647
He was very charming, very effective,

11:21.314 --> 11:23.487
Unlike some creatures I know.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.429
So, you knew Lebow too?

11:27.487 --> 11:29.990
Everybody in the business knew him.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.599
I never heard of him.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.867
Well, that's because you're
not really in the business.

11:34.928 --> 11:38.603
So, you call flying Airwolf for
the Firm not in the business.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.009
Of course, you're very effective in the field.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.412
I'd trust you with anything,
once the action starts.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.243
I don't need a testimonial.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.878
You know me. I always start out nice.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.456
So, what's your point?

11:54.113 --> 11:56.616
You're unbending, Hawke, unswerving.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.424
You think there's a right and wrong,

11:58.484 --> 12:00.225
and that the right should always win.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.560
Not so.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.259
There's gray and beige.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.769
There's a lot of almost and compromise,

12:05.825 --> 12:07.862
political maneuvering and intrigue.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.430
The people who do that are in the business.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.498
You still haven't made your point.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.602
Forget about helping Sarah Lebow.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.238
Let this Kruger thing go.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.608
She knows where Airwolf is.
Doesn't that concern you?

12:20.673 --> 12:23.552
We'll arrange a new hiding place for Airwolf.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.681
Then you'll know where Airwolf is.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.985
Yes.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.325
No, thanks.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.459
Hawke,

12:35.288 --> 12:37.859
I don't want you to go after Kruger.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.231
Why?

12:39.359 --> 12:40.497
It could…

12:41.728 --> 12:43.605
create difficulties.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.201
Are you tied in with him?

12:46.266 --> 12:49.213
Like I said, not everything
is black-and-white.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.840
I go after Kruger, I go against you.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.009
Nothing personal.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.017
Yeah.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.352
Never is.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.606
This wine is very good.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.977
We're all ready, sir.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.038
Good.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.079
Gentlemen, if you glance
into the courtyard here,

13:29.142 --> 13:31.213
you will see the latest American

13:31.277 --> 13:33.120
surface-to-air missile system,

13:33.179 --> 13:34.681
codename, Thor.

13:35.181 --> 13:39.652
It is unique, in that its 4
simultaneously fired missiles

13:39.719 --> 13:44.190
have both heat-seeking as well
as radar-targeting systems.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.799
2 missiles cover the higher
altitude and 2 the lower.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.809
The penetrating aircraft
might be able to evade one,

13:52.965 --> 13:55.445
or 2, or even 3 missiles,

13:55.501 --> 13:57.105
but, never 4.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.084
Which makes Thor the ultimate defense weapon

14:01.474 --> 14:03.750
at $10 million only a unit.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.252
I've heard such claims before.

14:07.213 --> 14:10.592
I'm not going to invest millions in claims.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.323
We're not expecting you to.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.558
I've prepared a demonstration.

14:18.624 --> 14:22.162
Yes, a pleasant lunch, excellent wine,

14:22.662 --> 14:24.300
and now we watch

14:24.931 --> 14:27.707
as you blow up a radio-controlled drone.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.304
I would never insult your intelligence

14:30.370 --> 14:32.941
or your purchasing power with drones.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.859
Prepare to fire the missiles.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.289
3… 2…

14:48.888 --> 14:50.799
1… fire.

14:58.798 --> 15:02.007
Are you trying to tell me there
is a pilot in that plane?

15:02.068 --> 15:05.174
One of the very best of
the West German Luftwaffe.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.617
Why would a man do such a thing?

15:07.673 --> 15:11.485
Obviously, because he feels
he can win against Thor.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.118
And if he can,

15:15.047 --> 15:17.220
I will give him $1 million.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.770
He's evaded the upper missiles.

15:28.628 --> 15:32.576
Now he's simply being forced
into the track of the lower.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.914
He's evaded the 3rd.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.013
Yes, but...

15:51.384 --> 15:55.457
Well, gentlemen, if you would
care to start your bidding,

15:55.721 --> 15:59.362
Mr. Minter will be happy
to record your offers.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.869
Please, gentlemen, step right over this way.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.575
Why so glum, Mr. Hawke?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.913
I'm just not big on carrying passengers.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.419
But, Mr. Hawke, I'm excellent company.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.752
I sing, I play the guitar.

16:19.178 --> 16:22.318
I can show you points of
interest during the flight.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.758
Thank you.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.486
Such as?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.188
There are 2 munitions centers

16:27.253 --> 16:28.823
right here, in your own country.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.834
In Texas, to be exact.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.664
Now, the deed holders have American names

16:33.726 --> 16:35.797
but the real owner is Kruger.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.207
Yeah, I heard a TV commentator
do about an hour on that guy.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.972
He's got quite an operation.

16:41.033 --> 16:44.913
He could create a war, and then
supply both sides with weapons.

16:45.104 --> 16:48.415
So, is it Kruger you really want
or the weapons he's storing?

16:48.474 --> 16:50.283
No, only Kruger.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.550
Why doesn't your government
just send in a commando team

16:52.612 --> 16:54.114
to take him out?

16:54.180 --> 16:57.491
Because we cannot afford
an international incident.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.860
You'll probably get blamed anyway.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.831
Finger-pointing, that's normal.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.165
All our flights are monitored.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.701
And they won't be able to prove anything.

17:10.363 --> 17:14.402
Hey, you've worked this out
pretty well, but what if we fail?

17:15.434 --> 17:17.107
Well, if we fail,

17:17.603 --> 17:20.083
then no one will know, will they?

17:24.175 --> 17:25.848
That's your answer?

17:25.912 --> 17:27.618
That's my answer.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.216
Well, I figured we might as well look

17:29.282 --> 17:31.728
on the bright side of things, eh?

17:32.852 --> 17:36.322
How come I don't like what you're
doin', but I'm enjoying it?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.596
Because, very much like my Father,

17:38.658 --> 17:41.070
you have a zest for laughter, Mr. Santini.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.305
Tet's still here.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.909
Doesn't mean anything.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.814
Hawke leaves him alone for weeks at a time.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.584
Oh, who feeds him?

17:57.343 --> 17:59.186
He feeds himself.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.251
He's gonna do it, isn't he?

18:05.318 --> 18:06.888
I'm afraid so.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.193
Damn it.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.936
Kruger is sitting on one of the
most sophisticated weapons systems

18:13.993 --> 18:15.028
in the world.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.631
And Hawke is gonna go up against it.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.170
We could warn him.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.412
No, we can't.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.946
Maybe just a little?

18:38.184 --> 18:39.822
This is the most amazing flight

18:39.885 --> 18:41.489
I've ever been on.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.932
A squadron of these
could rule the Middle East.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.867
Well, she's one of a kind.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.201
I know. That's why we're here together.

18:49.228 --> 18:50.536
How's our course?

18:50.596 --> 18:52.405
Still south.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.641
We'll be off the coast of Baja,
Mexico, in about, 20 minutes.

18:56.702 --> 18:59.376
We'll fly low till we turn
inland for that fuel pickup.

19:01.507 --> 19:04.317
$100, I know who that is.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.788
No bet.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.685
Morning, Michael.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.885
How's the fishing?

19:08.948 --> 19:10.985
I advised you to stay clear of this thing.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.424
You headed for Paraguay?

19:15.721 --> 19:17.530
I'll listen, you talk.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.662
It's not too late to turn back
and let me handle this thing.

19:20.726 --> 19:21.898
How?

19:22.928 --> 19:25.101
It's on a need-to-know basis.

19:25.331 --> 19:29.245
I can't run a finder beam
on a one-word response.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.180
You're forcing my hand. I don't
wanna line up against you.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.685
I think you know that.

19:35.741 --> 19:36.776
Yeah.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.877
Then turn back.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.445
There's too much involved.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.458
You're headed into an international incident

19:41.514 --> 19:43.187
that I won't be able to help you with.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.922
Well, maybe if you’d fill me in.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.254
You have no need to know.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.926
Take care, Michael.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.834
You, too.

20:05.404 --> 20:08.942
This is Priority 1. We
need an F-15 immediately

20:09.408 --> 20:11.820
and a series of mid-air refuels.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.160
Want to thank you.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.859
For what? I haven't done anything yet.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.402
But you kept your word.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.131
expect you will.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.134
Do you know anything about my family,

20:33.265 --> 20:35.336
I mean, other than what Archangel told you?

20:35.401 --> 20:38.814
Not much. I don't wanna
know any more than I do.

20:39.805 --> 20:43.617
Why? Are you afraid that someday
you might weep at my funeral?

20:50.883 --> 20:52.863
No, I wasn't planning on it.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.695
Well, are you planning on smiling
anytime in the near future?

20:56.789 --> 20:59.497
Because if so, I'll have any
medical attention you should need

21:00.659 --> 21:03.105
in case your skin should crack,
or your ears should fall off.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.536
Excuse me, was that static

21:06.599 --> 21:09.341
or, should I get the bandages ready?

21:09.468 --> 21:12.210
He laughed, Dominic. His lips moved

21:12.271 --> 21:14.683
and, yes, I even saw some teeth.

21:14.740 --> 21:18.187
Oh, and Dominic, I believe
that he has a dimple.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.948
You're sitting in the
ejection seat. Don't tempt me.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.255
Don't let him bluff you, Sarah.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.387
You haven't got any intention at all

21:26.519 --> 21:28.624
of letting me have any peace, do you?

21:28.687 --> 21:30.394
Absolutely not.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.196
This El Salvador group wants to know

21:37.263 --> 21:40.005
if we'll accept English pounds
instead of US currency.

21:40.099 --> 21:44.138
Discount it at 10% below the
lowest money exchange quotes.

21:44.370 --> 21:48.819
I already told them 15%. We're
negotiating right now at the 12% level.

21:49.208 --> 21:53.987
Then you can have half of
everything above 12%, a bonus.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.788
Right this way, gentlemen.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.671
As I was telling you, this
compound goes back to 1879,

22:09.728 --> 22:11.867
originally constructed by the Paloma family,

22:11.931 --> 22:13.740
when they immigrated from Spain.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.574
This, at one time, was the wine cellar,

22:15.634 --> 22:17.113
but as you see, it's been converted

22:17.169 --> 22:19.547
to an ordinance supply facility.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.713
Do you know what you are seeing here?

22:26.812 --> 22:28.689
Your stockpile.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.628
Not quite a stockpile.

22:34.954 --> 22:38.299
The ability to determine
the future of the world.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.934
Colonel, your ego is amazing.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.567
Certainly, you have an extensive arsenal here,

22:46.632 --> 22:50.170
one of the largest and the most
sophisticated I've ever seen,

22:51.670 --> 22:54.674
But you cannot compete with the
major powers of the world.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.311
I don't compete with them.
They compete with each other.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.879
I'm a middleman, an arranger.

23:00.779 --> 23:02.520
They develop, I sell,

23:03.282 --> 23:05.353
and collect a percentage.

23:05.751 --> 23:08.027
I still do not see your point.

23:08.354 --> 23:12.393
What if I did not sell
this defense system to you?

23:13.859 --> 23:15.497
What if I sold it to your cousins

23:15.561 --> 23:17.905
on your eastern borders instead?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.613
You see,

23:28.807 --> 23:30.343
I determine

23:31.076 --> 23:34.319
which side gains the
advantage, which side wins.

23:35.581 --> 23:39.222
Look at what 6 Exocet missiles

23:39.285 --> 23:42.494
nearly did to the British
Navy in the Falklands.

23:49.528 --> 23:52.441
If I had sold

23:53.365 --> 23:55.868
Argentina a dozen...

24:08.447 --> 24:10.256
How close are we, Dom?

24:10.316 --> 24:11.795
Less than 10 miles.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.261
Let's go in for a low-level scan.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.068
How much can you spot with your scanners?

24:21.126 --> 24:24.573
Weapons, personnel,
general building locations.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.107
Start the scan, forward area, left to right.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.943
Got it. We're approaching some buildings.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.482
Hey!

24:34.540 --> 24:36.679
Our beams are coming back scrambled.

24:36.742 --> 24:39.552
Nobody knows our frequencies, except...

24:41.347 --> 24:43.588
I'm going in for a closer look.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.586
You want the searchlights?

24:46.719 --> 24:48.528
When I call for them.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.199
Now.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.079
That's Kruger.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.441
And Archangel.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.213
Flare.

25:20.819 --> 25:21.763
Go back.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.128
I can't. I'd have to fight him.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.929
But he's fighting you.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.560
Dom, give me turbos.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.569
Turbos.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.401
Check to see if we're being radar scanned.

25:30.462 --> 25:31.463
Checking.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.237
Hawke, we could’ve got him.

25:33.298 --> 25:35.039
I can’t shoot Archangel.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.773
I could have.

25:49.448 --> 25:50.984
This is insanity.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.326
You are giving Kruger time to prepare.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.625
We should be attacking that fortress

25:54.653 --> 25:57.259
instead of staying here sipping tea.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.460
Coffee.

25:58.524 --> 25:59.468
Whatever.

25:59.525 --> 26:02.369
I thought you wanted Kruger to
stand trial for his crimes.

26:02.428 --> 26:03.463
You know I do.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.372
Well, going in with Airwolf's guns blazing

26:05.431 --> 26:07.911
is not the way to accomplish that.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.946
It's not getting Kruger out of here

26:10.002 --> 26:12.778
into Israel alive that's troubling you, is it?

26:12.838 --> 26:15.250
It's going up against Archangel.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.085
What is it?

26:18.243 --> 26:20.484
What's this hold he has over you?

26:20.546 --> 26:22.389
I thought it was the other way around.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.826
Look, I know that Airwolf belonged to the Firm

26:24.883 --> 26:26.226
before you took it.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.526
But whatever Archangel has going with Kruger

26:28.587 --> 26:30.589
is far more important than even Airwolf,

26:30.656 --> 26:33.432
or he wouldn't have given Kruger
our scanning frequencies.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.904
Look, we could have been blown
out of the sky last night.

26:35.961 --> 26:37.941
Those weapons they fired at Airwolf last night

26:37.996 --> 26:39.737
wouldn't penetrate it. Archangel knew that.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.038
Perhaps.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.213
But Archangel would kill you if he had to.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.074
So would you.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.661
Nobody's dead, and nobody has to die.

26:58.684 --> 26:59.788
You are naive, Dominic.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.422
Oh, no, I am not.

27:03.388 --> 27:04.958
Really? What?

27:07.526 --> 27:08.869
You have a plan?

27:08.927 --> 27:09.997
No.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.233
But I am sure the "spotless wonder" has.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.709
Obviously, to keep Kruger out of my hands.

27:14.766 --> 27:16.746
Oh, at one time maybe,

27:16.802 --> 27:18.213
but not now.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.448
See, Archangel knows that String is here.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.385
He also knows that our boy doesn't give up

27:24.443 --> 27:26.980
once he sets his mind onto something.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.548
Well, then what do we do?

27:29.615 --> 27:31.959
Exactly what we have been doing.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.256
Wait for Archangel to call.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.736
Why didn't you tell me?

27:42.060 --> 27:43.596
You didn't ask.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.508
You could have warned
me about that helicopter.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.978
I gave you their scanning frequencies.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.708
You didn't tell me that it was

27:51.770 --> 27:54.944
as fast as a jet and armor-plated.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.309
Must have slipped my mind.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.119
Don't you get smart with me.

27:59.244 --> 28:00.587
Nor you with me.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.250
Airwolf is important to the Firm.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.385
I won't have it shot down.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.390
And me?

28:08.287 --> 28:10.028
You are important, too.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.761
You seem to have forgotten that.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.967
If I had, you would be on Airwolf right now

28:14.026 --> 28:15.937
on your way to Israel.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.378
I could kill you.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.310
Of course.

28:24.770 --> 28:28.081
But then, where would you
get Thor missiles to sell?

28:30.242 --> 28:34.247
You are not the only supplier of
missiles in the world, Archangel.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.753
No, but I am the only one who can supply you

28:36.815 --> 28:39.557
with systems as sophisticated as Thor.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.868
What do you propose?

28:49.761 --> 28:51.570
I'll need a vehicle.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.307
To do what?

28:54.366 --> 28:58.007
Rendezvous with Airwolf. Call them off.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.580
Very well.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.379
But if you can't,

29:02.608 --> 29:06.249
I shall have to seek them out and destroy it.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.216
Give me 24 hours.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.151
Not one minute more, hmm?

29:21.460 --> 29:23.269
He looks disturbed.

29:23.328 --> 29:25.501
He has good reason to be.

29:25.631 --> 29:28.009
He is trying to call off that helicopter.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.636
Can he do that?

29:29.701 --> 29:32.841
I don't know. But it doesn't matter.

29:33.538 --> 29:36.849
I will use him to lead
our air force friends to it.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.951
Have a beacon installed in his jeep,

29:40.012 --> 29:41.923
and be sure that it's on a frequency

29:41.980 --> 29:44.358
that the helicopter can't detect.

29:44.483 --> 29:45.791
Yes, sir.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.364
And, Minter,

29:48.820 --> 29:52.131
hold back a Thor unit on tomorrow's shipment.

29:52.691 --> 29:55.331
That's a loss of $10 million, Colonel.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.135
3 of it, pure profit.

29:57.195 --> 30:02.008
My dear friend, money is
useless if you are dead.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.710
Yes, sir.

30:47.212 --> 30:49.988
Hawke, give me a location.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.658
It's time for us to have a face-to-face.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.897
Hawke, do you read me?

30:58.457 --> 30:59.663
Hawke?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.130
Do you read me?

31:13.271 --> 31:14.875
See anything?

31:15.907 --> 31:18.854
Nothing for 10 klicks. He's alone, String.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.453
You stay on the scope.

31:22.914 --> 31:24.655
I'm not going anywhere.

32:03.522 --> 32:07.368
Well, I have not seen you
since I was a little girl.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.639
A very beautiful little girl.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.610
I was sorry to hear about your Father.

32:14.666 --> 32:18.773
Thank you. The wars have
not been gentle with you.

32:20.105 --> 32:23.086
I can do the last half of my life on one eye.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.716
The eye patch is most charming,

32:27.779 --> 32:31.283
after all, it is almost a
national symbol in my country.

32:31.416 --> 32:32.895
But the cane,

32:33.485 --> 32:37.092
the cane makes you look as if
you are asking for sympathy.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.033
You are as stubborn as Hawke.

32:45.096 --> 32:49.101
Go home, Sarah, and take
Sir Galahad here with you.

32:49.334 --> 32:51.644
Kruger killed my Father.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.580
I am not going back to Israel without him.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.417
You said he would come with a plan.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.923
He did.

33:02.447 --> 33:03.824
Didn't you, Michael?

33:03.882 --> 33:06.658
The only plan I have, you all are ruining.

33:06.718 --> 33:10.256
What is more important than bringing
a butcher like Kruger to justice?

33:10.322 --> 33:12.666
Saving lives, many lives.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.066
Most of them in your country.

33:15.126 --> 33:18.539
We got company, coming in fast from the north.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.043
I knew I couldn't trust that Nazi.

33:21.566 --> 33:22.704
You keep her here.

33:22.767 --> 33:23.905
Wait!

33:34.880 --> 33:37.884
I got a pair of Phantoms
20 miles out, closing fast.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.020
What's their armament?

33:40.085 --> 33:41.428
Sparrows.

33:44.456 --> 33:47.767
I sure hate going against
American-built planes and missiles.

33:47.826 --> 33:50.136
Well, that might be just what saves us.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.293
They're on the deck and coming fast.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.231
Check the frequency our Sparrows
are set to and jam them.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.567
Yeah, but what if theirs are
set on a different frequency?

34:21.626 --> 34:23.572
Then we're in trouble.

34:36.174 --> 34:37.744
They've launched their missiles.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.447
Jamming, I hope.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.552
They are still closing.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.255
Vary the frequency slightly.

35:05.036 --> 35:08.040
Hey, String, I think these
missiles are locked on each other.

36:18.743 --> 36:19.881
It's funny.

36:19.944 --> 36:23.551
If those missiles hadn't been
American, we'd have had it.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.157
Nice goin', String.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.690
Yep?

36:38.963 --> 36:42.308
So, he destroyed the Interceptor, huh?

36:43.401 --> 36:44.744
Yes, sir.

36:45.303 --> 36:46.714
Incredible.

36:47.372 --> 36:51.013
I wonder what Archangel would
want for such a weapon?

36:51.409 --> 36:54.618
Archangel, he is obviously
running with them now.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.226
Yes, you're quite right.
I could never trust him.

36:57.282 --> 37:00.456
That helicopter, it will
come back now, won't it?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.762
I certainly hope so.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.333
Even in little pieces I could
find something of value.

37:19.604 --> 37:22.141
You can't go zooming into a foreign country

37:22.207 --> 37:26.383
and attack the residence of one of
their nationals, no matter who he is.

37:26.444 --> 37:28.481
Unless, I'm on a mission for the Firm.

37:28.546 --> 37:31.288
Damn it, Hawke, there are
innocent people in there.

37:31.349 --> 37:34.193
In the middle of a munitions bunker?

37:37.355 --> 37:38.561
You will all be killed.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.603
Ah, he cares.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.966
What's gonna kill us, Michael?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.699
Kruger has Thor missiles.

37:48.366 --> 37:52.109
Why, that's the hottest air-missile
system in the US arsenal.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.776
The government doesn't even
allow its allies to have them.

37:54.839 --> 37:57.820
How could Kruger get a hold of such weapons?

37:59.677 --> 38:02.521
Michael arranged it. Didn't you, Michael?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.685
Yeah, sort of.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.752
You put a weapon system like that in the hands

38:07.819 --> 38:09.025
of a man like Kruger?

38:09.087 --> 38:11.124
Who are his buyers?

38:11.756 --> 38:13.099
Iranians.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.334
I don't think he deserved that.

38:17.395 --> 38:19.306
He deserves to be shot.

38:19.931 --> 38:23.208
I've got an idea he deserves
a medal for ingenuity.

38:25.069 --> 38:26.514
If they didn't buy it from Kruger,

38:26.571 --> 38:29.177
they'd have to buy it from the Russians.

38:29.541 --> 38:33.079
And Russian missiles would be a
whole lot harder to defend against.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.680
I don't understand.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.317
There is no defense against a Thor system.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.794
There is, if you know
its operating frequencies.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.694
Thor operates on randomly selected,

38:41.753 --> 38:43.824
constantly changing frequencies.

38:43.888 --> 38:46.061
There's no way on earth to jam them.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.900
So, you built in a self-destruct system.

38:50.195 --> 38:52.801
Since you've figured it out,
there's no loss in telling.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.935
It's an integral part of the guidance system.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.276
All an American or Israeli plane has to do

38:58.603 --> 39:01.516
is punch a button on a little black box.

39:03.942 --> 39:07.355
You put the hottest
missile system in the world

39:08.012 --> 39:11.118
into the hands of people who can't use ‘em.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.725
They won't know that until it's too late.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.992
I've gotta hand it to you, Mike.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.465
Now that's brilliant.

39:20.425 --> 39:21.426
Thank you.

39:21.492 --> 39:24.268
So, we can go in after Kruger.

39:24.829 --> 39:26.467
He cannot stop us.

39:26.531 --> 39:29.705
He'd be a fool if he didn't hold
back at least one Thor unit

39:29.767 --> 39:31.041
to defend himself against you.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.274
So what?

39:32.337 --> 39:35.944
All you have to do is push the
button on that little black box.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.782
Which we don't have.

39:40.678 --> 39:42.749
We just might not need it.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.630
The money has been transferred
to your Swiss account,

39:48.686 --> 39:50.188
$100 million.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.126
That's very good.

39:54.525 --> 39:57.165
Colonel, you told me yourself,

39:57.228 --> 39:59.572
money is no good if you're dead.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.136
Please, let's leave now.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.647
Let's get out of here before
the helicopter comes back.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.718
Aren't you in the least bit curious

40:08.773 --> 40:12.084
how he defends himself
against the indefensible?

40:12.977 --> 40:14.047
No.

40:15.647 --> 40:16.990
You are a coward?

40:17.749 --> 40:18.853
Yes.

40:19.817 --> 40:21.694
At least you are honest.

40:21.819 --> 40:23.730
I like that quality about you.

40:24.989 --> 40:28.027
Well, then you will let me go?

40:28.092 --> 40:29.537
No.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.428
Look, I have to go in after Kruger.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.792
Archangel will do that.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.093
Kruger didn't kill Archangel's Father.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.725
He killed mine.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.932
I thought you wanted him to stand trial.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.098
I do.

41:04.729 --> 41:06.367
You want revenge.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.170
You want to kill him face-to-face.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.270
How would you know?

41:12.437 --> 41:15.145
Because I've been there. I've done it.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.413
I wouldn't want you to live with that

41:21.479 --> 41:23.982
or die trying.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.691
I'm not going to die.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.696
Don't ever say that.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.699
And don't promise what you can't keep.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.498
What woman did?

41:40.231 --> 41:41.608
All of them.

41:54.545 --> 41:55.990
He's coming.

42:28.112 --> 42:30.456
We're a little ahead of schedule.

42:30.615 --> 42:33.824
Well, do you intend to park
here and take up sunbathing?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.253
Yes.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.300
For about 3 minutes.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.593
You're beginning to sound like Hawke.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.496
No one has ever accused me of that before.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.974
I am not sure whether that's
a curse or a compliment.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.704
I don't know either.

42:48.766 --> 42:50.370
I'll have to think about that.

42:50.435 --> 42:53.712
No, don't. You'd only be
wasting more of your time

42:53.771 --> 42:57.150
and you've already wasted the
most wonderful part of your life.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.915
What about my Father?

42:58.976 --> 43:00.819
Did he waste his life, too?

43:00.878 --> 43:02.880
He had his cause. He had his purpose.

43:02.947 --> 43:04.358
Yes, he did.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.396
But things occurred that gave him no choice.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.527
Hawke has no choice, either.

43:09.654 --> 43:11.725
Until he finds his brother.

43:12.623 --> 43:14.569
Then, uh, it's all over.

43:15.626 --> 43:16.764
Maybe.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.799
You are not going any further.
This is where you get out.

43:23.501 --> 43:24.502
Sure.

43:31.409 --> 43:33.082
You're not going.

43:35.413 --> 43:38.485
Isn't that a bit ridiculous?
You're not going to shoot me.

43:42.487 --> 43:43.932
You shot me!

43:43.988 --> 43:45.695
I just nicked you.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.434
But if you don't hand over those keys,

43:48.493 --> 43:50.803
I'll nick something more vital.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.244
You actually shot me!

43:56.901 --> 43:58.847
The keys, please.

44:01.672 --> 44:03.583
From right there.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.721
Thank you.

45:00.765 --> 45:03.769
He makes it too easy. Fire at will.

45:04.669 --> 45:06.342
Fire the missiles!

45:09.407 --> 45:12.286
Here they come, all 4 at once.

45:19.584 --> 45:20.995
20,000.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.631
Give me 2 Sun Bursts.

45:40.004 --> 45:41.711
He's got 2 down.

45:42.607 --> 45:44.518
But the 2 most deadly to go.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.892
We got a pair on our tail, closin’ fast.

46:05.129 --> 46:06.130
You got ‘em.

46:06.197 --> 46:07.574
I got 1.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.507
There's only 1 left!

46:10.935 --> 46:13.381
But there is no way to escape it.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.246
We got 10 seconds, String.

46:22.546 --> 46:24.116
7 seconds.

46:26.617 --> 46:27.960
5 seconds.

46:30.988 --> 46:32.126
2…

47:11.295 --> 47:12.467
Kruger.

47:21.038 --> 47:22.813
Don't do it, Sarah.

47:23.941 --> 47:25.420
Don't do it.

47:30.815 --> 47:32.852
If it doesn't heal by the trial,

47:32.917 --> 47:35.864
you can tell everyone it was a dueling scar.

47:45.596 --> 47:47.166
If you keep this up, sir,

47:47.231 --> 47:50.110
the Firm's gonna have to clone parts of you.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.338
You like your job, Marella?

47:52.403 --> 47:55.179
I… I still can't figure out how it happened.

47:55.239 --> 47:58.709
I mean, by the time you got to the
fortress the shooting had stopped.

47:59.477 --> 48:02.651
Well, you see it was like this.

48:03.414 --> 48:04.825
We were, I…

48:04.882 --> 48:07.158
Well, Dominic, it… it was my fault.

48:07.218 --> 48:11.598
You see, he asked me to get
out and I wouldn't go and…

48:11.822 --> 48:14.996
it gave a sniper enough
time to get a shot at us.

48:17.862 --> 48:19.170
A sniper?

48:19.630 --> 48:22.167
I could have sworn these are powder burns.

48:22.933 --> 48:24.640
Would anybody like another drink?

48:24.702 --> 48:27.012
Hey, for once, you're talking my language.

48:29.507 --> 48:30.884
Thank you.

48:30.941 --> 48:32.852
Hello, boy.

48:37.615 --> 48:39.253
You shot his ear?

48:40.451 --> 48:42.988
He just wouldn't take me seriously.

48:48.225 --> 48:49.863
What's so funny?
