01:03.730 --> 01:06.149
I've brought
a special guest with me today.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.984
I'm sure you recognize him.

01:08.068 --> 01:13.239
He's the youngest pilot ever to lead
a mission into space, Takashi Shirogane!

01:13.323 --> 01:16.201
Thanks for having me.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.702
Wow, it's really Takashi!
I'm excited!

01:17.786 --> 01:20.830
Shiro broke the record
for the fastest orbital velocity,

01:20.914 --> 01:25.084
beating the old heliocentric speed
by about 50 kilometers per second.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.048
The Galaxy Garrison
sent me to schools in the area

01:30.131 --> 01:33.343
to help find the next generation
of astroexplorers.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.471
Who's ready to find out
if they've got what it takes?

01:39.516 --> 01:44.437
All right, all right. To do that,
we're going to give you a test.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.898
A test?

01:46.981 --> 01:47.941
Not a test.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.652
By playing a video game.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.329
Introducing the Orbit Axiom X,

02:01.412 --> 02:04.207
the Galaxy Garrison's
 most advanced flight simulator.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.627
Cadets not much older than you
use simulators just like this

02:08.711 --> 02:11.965
to train to become the next generation
of space explorers.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.509
-Let's see what you got.
-Wow!

02:25.770 --> 02:27.814
Cool! You made it
through the first checkpoint!

02:30.150 --> 02:33.528
-Oh, man!
-Sorry, man, good luck next time.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.406
Oh, no, dude. Really?

02:39.659 --> 02:42.829
-What?
-Oh, I'm so bad at this!

02:43.371 --> 02:47.125
We've had some great tries,
but nobody's made it past the third level.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.503
Looks like you're the only one who's left.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.422
Think you got what it takes?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.014
That emo kid's doing it!

03:04.142 --> 03:06.769
- Look at that!
- So cool!

03:10.523 --> 03:14.944
No way! Keith made it past level five?
Thing's gotta be broken.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.404
I've compiled a list of students

03:16.487 --> 03:18.781
I think would make the best candidates
for the Garrison.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.702
Is this guy on there?

03:22.785 --> 03:25.163
Looks like he's just about ready
to fly the real thing.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.499
Keith? He's a bit of a discipline case.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.462
I don't think he'd necessarily fit in
with the rigid Garrison culture.

03:33.755 --> 03:37.133
This is James Griffin.
He has the highest grades in school.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.843
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Shirogane.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.519
Is that your car?

03:56.152 --> 03:57.654
I don't get it.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.074
I steal your car
and you respond by helping me out?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.244
Yeah, so you owe me one.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.288
Be at this address tomorrow at 0800 hours.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.710
You're getting a second chance.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.355
Is-- is he gonna be okay?

04:33.273 --> 04:37.068
Only time will tell if this body
will accept Shiro's consciousness.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.404
Is there anything
we can do to help?

04:39.487 --> 04:41.656
I've tried contacting
the Voltron Coalition,

04:41.739 --> 04:44.867
but I can't get through to anyone.
It doesn't make any sense.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.080
There might be some distortion
I'm not picking up on.

04:49.163 --> 04:52.500
Maybe we need to get into the upper
atmosphere for a better signal?

04:52.583 --> 04:55.586
The lions aren't going anywhere
without recharging their power cores.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.298
The battle with Lotor
severely depleted them.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.176
If we had the Castle of Lions
we could recharge them, but...

05:04.345 --> 05:06.597
Is there another way to recharge them?

05:06.681 --> 05:10.226
They can recharge naturally
given enough time and ambient energy,

05:10.310 --> 05:13.938
- but that might take phoebs.
- There's gotta be something we can do.

05:14.022 --> 05:18.192
We are on the Dalterian Belt,
 home to the element faunatonium.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.945
We may be able to use it
as a temporary solution.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.740
Faunatonium?
How will that charge the power cores?

05:23.823 --> 05:27.243
-It involves gluon field fluctuations--
-You know what? Never mind.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.037
Magic or something? Sure.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.040
Not far off.
We're going to use the element

05:32.123 --> 05:34.751
to expand the energy particles
within the cores.

05:34.834 --> 05:39.714
-But first, we need a yalmor.
-Wait, there are yalmors on this planet?

05:40.256 --> 05:44.510
How do you think we find the faunatonium?
Yalmors have a nose for the stuff.

05:44.594 --> 05:48.347
Okay. You guys find a yalmor
and get this faunatonium.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.099
I'll stay with Shiro.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.771
I'll stay as well.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.899
I may have exhausted
the limits of what I learned on Oriande,

05:57.982 --> 06:01.027
but I still might be able to help
in some way.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.321
All right, then, we'll get started.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.450
Wait, you just fought Lotor,

06:08.034 --> 06:11.996
defeated him, stopped an explosion
that could have destroyed reality,

06:12.080 --> 06:13.414
took your friend's consciousness

06:13.498 --> 06:16.667
from the Black Lion of Voltron,
and put it inside his clone,

06:16.751 --> 06:18.753
and now we're simply moving on?

06:20.004 --> 06:22.048
Trust me, I'm always saying
the exact same thing,

06:22.131 --> 06:24.509
but these guys like to move on.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.431
He's going to be okay, Keith.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.558
I hope so.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.977
You can't imagine all he's done for me.

06:45.863 --> 06:51.285
That's the Calypso, the first ship to
carry astronauts to the moons of Jupiter.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.914
It took them three years to get there.
Longest voyage of its kind.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.582
That's right.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.294
Reading about that mission
is what made me wanna be a pilot.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.713
Those astronauts braved the unknown.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.424
People can accomplish incredible things

07:05.508 --> 07:07.176
if they're willing to put in
the time and effort.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.680
I wanna help you, Keith.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.266
I think you've got a lot of potential.

07:13.349 --> 07:17.812
But what you decide to do
with that potential is up to you.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.736
Wow!

07:26.904 --> 07:27.905
Whoa...!

07:32.201 --> 07:34.454
This looks like a yalmor patch.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.041
Yep, yalmors definitely sprayed here.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.266
There's a yalmor!

07:56.142 --> 07:58.686
Wow. They're a lot uglier
than I thought they'd be.

07:58.769 --> 07:59.854
I think it's cute,

07:59.937 --> 08:02.273
you know, in a creepy,
hideous sort of way.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.941
Like you, Lance.

08:04.025 --> 08:08.529
Shh! Yalmors are extremely aggressive.
Any sign of weakness and they attack.

08:08.613 --> 08:12.825
You've gotta corner it, and make it think
you're the bigger, meaner yalmor.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.996
Alfor and I used the Squelzian Technique
to wrangle up some yalmors.

08:17.079 --> 08:21.292
-Are all ancient Alteans like this?
-Well, we only know two.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.222
Ow! Ugh!

08:36.265 --> 08:38.683
Oh, hi, there, little fella.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.537
What the quizacker just happened?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.998
Uh, it's pronounced "quiznak,"
and I have no idea.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.875
Uh, what's that sound?

09:02.959 --> 09:06.087
-Lance, what did you do?
-Nothing! I just bumped into--

09:06.170 --> 09:07.338
What's that?

09:13.511 --> 09:16.180
Oh, no! It's the yalmor!

09:23.646 --> 09:26.274
His levels
are getting dangerously low.

09:27.358 --> 09:31.112
Fight. I won't give up on you.

09:32.613 --> 09:36.200
Bank right
and maintain heading at 0.27 degrees.

09:36.867 --> 09:40.288
Increase throttle by 35 percent
and bank left.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.588
Increase elevation, 15 degrees.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.053
I'm getting dizzy.
I knew I shouldn't have eaten so much.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.139
Oh, make it stop.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.269
Fall in line, cadet.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.063
Just testing my controls. Stick's loose.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.691
Keep this up, and you'll be stuck
a cargo pilot.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.901
Yeah, Keith,
you're gonna get us in trouble.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.864
Decrease elevation by 22 degrees.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.074
Keith!

10:19.285 --> 10:21.662
Looks like we've got a show-off.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.545
Hope you all like it
in the simulator.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.465
You can thank Pilot Fancypants over there
for the privilege

10:32.548 --> 10:36.093
of spending the next three weekends
in here running drills!

10:41.265 --> 10:43.351
-Thanks a lot.
-My pleasure.

10:44.101 --> 10:47.480
We all know the only reason you're here
is because of Shiro.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.232
I can outfly anyone in this building.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.486
Oh, yeah? Is that what Mommy
and Daddy told you before--

10:57.156 --> 10:59.617
Hey!
Hey, break it up!

11:04.622 --> 11:06.165
Understood. I'll handle it.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.927
-Hey.
-Look, I know I messed up.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.930
You should send me back
to the home already.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.932
This place isn't for me.

11:23.015 --> 11:27.645
Keith, you can do this.
I will never give up on you.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.024
But, more importantly,
you can't give up on yourself.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.238
-You don't even know me.
-You're right. I don't.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.365
But sometimes, we all need a hand.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.838
Adventures are not fun!

11:53.921 --> 11:56.257
Thank you!
That's what I'm always saying!

12:06.809 --> 12:09.937
Watch out for that grass!

12:11.814 --> 12:14.066
-We're not running fast enough!
-Run at an angle!

12:14.150 --> 12:15.818
How can I run at a--?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.236
Oh.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.156
Ugh! Huh?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.657
We're trapped!

12:44.263 --> 12:45.264
Huh?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.689
Huh? Keith, do you copy?

12:54.356 --> 12:56.984
Allura? Krolia? Anyone?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.488
The miniaturization must've caused

13:00.571 --> 13:02.907
our communicators' range
to drop exponentially.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.116
Nothing's getting through.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.078
We're so small. It'll take us forever
to get back to the rest of the crew.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.622
What are we going to do?

13:21.091 --> 13:23.802
Come on, catch up!

14:00.172 --> 14:01.173
Whoa...!

14:13.185 --> 14:14.478
Whoo!

14:14.562 --> 14:16.939
All right. You won this round,

14:17.022 --> 14:18.857
but I'll get you in the next race,
old timer.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.902
I don't doubt it.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.071
How'd you do that dive, anyway?

14:24.154 --> 14:27.408
You liked that one, huh?
It's all about timing.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.744
Pull up too soon, you won't have
the momentum needed to create lift.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.706
Too late, there won't be enough lift
to avoid the crash.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.042
You think I'm ready to try that?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.587
What do you think?

14:42.339 --> 14:46.635
Maybe I should be patient
and keep focusing on the basics first.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.096
You're learning.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.390
So you grew up out here?

14:52.683 --> 14:54.977
Yep. Just me and my pop.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.273
He was a fireman, right?

15:00.149 --> 15:03.110
Yeah. He was a real hero.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.238
Hmm. Everyone told him
not to run back into that building,

15:06.322 --> 15:08.616
but you couldn't tell him anything.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.577
Sounds like someone I know.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.287
Oh.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.497
What are those?

15:16.707 --> 15:19.752
Oh... these are just
some electro-stimulators

15:19.835 --> 15:21.170
to keep my muscles loose.

15:22.129 --> 15:25.049
-What's wrong with your muscles?
-Ah, nothing.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.635
This is just what happens
when you get to be an "old-timer."

15:28.135 --> 15:30.304
Come on.
We should get back to the base.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.398
What if we're
this "quizacking" small forever?

15:41.482 --> 15:44.860
It's "quiznaking,"
and yes, thank you, Romelle. What if?

15:46.862 --> 15:50.866
Coran, you said the faunatonium works
on gluon field fluctuations, right?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.410
Correct. It expands atomic distance.

15:53.494 --> 15:57.331
-Maybe it'll work to make us bigger.
-You might be on to something.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.416
But how are we gonna find
the faunatonium?

16:00.084 --> 16:02.503
With a yalmor. We'll lure one back here.

16:02.962 --> 16:07.174
Lure a yalmor? To us? Like this?

16:07.257 --> 16:10.678
I mean, it's like,
I think it and you say it.

16:11.261 --> 16:15.516
It will be incredibly dangerous,
and Hunk's our only hope.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.354
No, absolutely not!

16:20.437 --> 16:22.815
Why not?
He's cleared all his physicals.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.692
I don't care what the doctor says.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.444
This man is sick and he shouldn't be sent
on another mission,

16:27.528 --> 16:29.488
especially as far away as Kerberos.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.074
I have to report this to Flight Command.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.035
Shiro is the best pilot
in the Garrison by far.

16:35.119 --> 16:38.497
He's saved my bacon in deep space
more times than I can count.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.500
If he doesn't go on this mission,
neither do I.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.767
Everything okay?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.771
Iverson thinks
I shouldn't go on the mission.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.606
Called in the big guns.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.898
Admiral Sanda showed up

17:05.983 --> 17:08.484
and tried to convince Sam to remove me
from the crew.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.944
Well, maybe he's right.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.696
Maybe you shouldn't go on the mission.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.741
You'll only be putting yourself at risk.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.578
You know how important this is to me.
It's worth the risk.

17:18.912 --> 17:22.332
Takashi,
how important am I to you?

17:22.790 --> 17:26.837
Every mission, every drill,
I've been right there with you.

17:27.503 --> 17:31.633
But this is more than a mission.
This is your life at stake.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.678
Don't start that again, Adam.
You don't need to protect me.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.431
This is something I need to do for myself.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.308
There's nothing left for you to prove.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.685
You've broken every record
there is to break.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.522
I know I can't stop you...

17:46.565 --> 17:49.068
but I won't go through this again.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.155
So, if you decide to go...

17:53.989 --> 17:56.658
don't expect me to be here
when you get back.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.869
I've got a class to teach.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.427
I can't believe we're doing this.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.263
You can't believe it? I am literal bait!

18:18.347 --> 18:20.099
How could I possibly let this happen?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.643
I told you, Hunk.
You're the biggest meal

18:22.726 --> 18:24.353
and you scream the loudest.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.189
I don't care that I-- okay!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.859
Keep up that panicked yelling.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.195
That's what we need to attract the yalmor.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.863
Seriously, guys...!

18:38.492 --> 18:41.036
Oh! Oh!
Oh, no! Oh, no!

18:43.747 --> 18:44.581
Now!

18:49.753 --> 18:52.047
We've made it much further
than seems possible!

18:55.843 --> 18:58.220
Oh, no!

18:58.303 --> 18:59.596
Oh--!

18:59.888 --> 19:01.723
This is going well.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.869
-When were you gonna tell me?
-Oh. Hey, Keith.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.705
So, what is it?
Are you sick or something?

19:25.664 --> 19:29.042
-I'm not sure I follow--
-I was outside your office.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.087
I overheard you and Commander Holt
talking with Admiral Sanda.

19:32.171 --> 19:36.049
Tell me the truth. Tell me what's wrong.
I'm not a little kid. I can handle it.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.389
I have a disease...

19:43.223 --> 19:44.975
and it's getting worse.

19:45.767 --> 19:49.479
I'll only be able to maintain
my peak condition for a couple more years.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.023
After that...

19:52.691 --> 19:56.612
The Garrison doesn't want me up there.
Neither does Adam.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.114
So, what are you gonna do?

20:01.575 --> 20:03.452
I'm going on the mission.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.788
This is worse than being bait!

20:07.497 --> 20:10.834
Yes! At least then you were
the only one in danger!

20:10.918 --> 20:12.544
Hey, Romelle!

20:22.971 --> 20:25.140
-What's going on?
 -More yalmors!

20:25.224 --> 20:28.560
If they link at the ears,
we're sitting on a faunatonium wizplute!

20:40.030 --> 20:42.115
Whoo-hoo! Yalmor time!

20:42.199 --> 20:44.952
Pay attention, Paladins!
This is how you work together!

20:45.035 --> 20:46.954
-All right, let's go.
-Wait. What?

20:47.037 --> 20:49.206
Look, if we wanna get back
to our regular size,

20:49.289 --> 20:50.958
we have to jump in there.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.043
Are we actually going to do this?

20:53.126 --> 20:56.004
Unless you wanna spend the rest
of your tiny life on the back of a yalmor.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.130
Wait for me!

21:16.733 --> 21:17.985
Oh, man!

21:33.417 --> 21:36.503
- Oh, quiznak.
- My back.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.887
I'm afraid the clone body
is rejecting Shiro's consciousness.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.348
There must be some way you can help!

21:49.474 --> 21:51.310
There's nothing I can do.

21:54.104 --> 21:57.316
Shiro, please. Fight!

21:58.317 --> 22:00.610
You can't do this to me again.

22:11.621 --> 22:12.456
Shiro!

22:15.917 --> 22:19.004
Keith...? I was dreaming.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.342
Keith... you saved me.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.094
We saved each other.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.143
Shiro's looking better. All right!

22:33.226 --> 22:35.562
Where were you guys?
We couldn't get ahold of you.

22:35.645 --> 22:39.649
Well, we were shrunk by a magic skunk,
but we ended up using that sparkly dust

22:39.733 --> 22:43.028
that makes electricity bigger or whatever.
Used it to unshrink ourselves.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.280
So, ready to charge up the lions?

22:47.157 --> 22:49.159
It's good to be back.

22:50.305 --> 22:56.384
