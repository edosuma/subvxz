WEBVTT

00:00.884 --> 00:02.721
My second novel
was just rejected.

00:02.812 --> 00:05.427
The board in Dallas wants
to cut your column.

00:05.522 --> 00:08.548
I quit. The magazine doesn't need
me any more and I don't need it.

00:08.702 --> 00:11.026
You may have been sold illegally obtained sperm.

00:11.127 --> 00:13.013
You're telling me that I'm
pregnant with this guy's baby!?

00:13.102 --> 00:13.988
- You're pregnant?
- You're pregnant?

00:14.080 --> 00:16.209
Well, it's very early.
We're not really telling anyone.

00:16.326 --> 00:18.103
- I have a daughter.
- You guys close?

00:18.193 --> 00:20.739
We love each other but
we don't really know each other.

00:20.842 --> 00:22.691
Hey, should I send
her a text message?

00:22.785 --> 00:24.563
I want you to bring $20,000!

00:24.645 --> 00:27.642
- Why did your friend park on the lawn?
- Mom, he's not my friend!

00:27.737 --> 00:28.670
Got the money?

00:28.780 --> 00:31.064
My stalker sent me
12 e-mails last night.

00:31.143 --> 00:32.350
This was left downstairs.

00:32.476 --> 00:34.072
It's an X-Acto knife!

00:36.335 --> 00:37.465
I love you, Ray.

00:37.932 --> 00:40.209
I can do anything I want.
I can open a restaurant,

00:40.310 --> 00:44.593
I can start an Internet magazine,
we're both our own bosses now.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.914
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.915
I thought that these knives
would be a sort of

01:55.950 --> 01:58.451
metaphorical ribbon cutting
for my new book

01:58.485 --> 01:59.852
"the blonde in the woods."

01:59.886 --> 02:02.554
Oh, it's metaphorical.

02:02.588 --> 02:05.056
I thought he was just being
self-destructive.

02:05.090 --> 02:07.925
- Is it over?
- It's all over, sweetie.

02:07.959 --> 02:10.995
I'll be signing books,
iPads and kindles.

02:11.029 --> 02:12.496
Ah!

02:16.599 --> 02:19.030
- Who should I sign it to?
- Just sign it, kid.

02:24.130 --> 02:25.964
Thank you very much.

02:26.966 --> 02:29.200
Weak grip.
Good to know.

02:29.234 --> 02:30.834
What?

02:32.737 --> 02:36.305
Mom, dad, you guys don't have to wait in line.
I'll sign your books after.

02:36.339 --> 02:38.007
But I'm your biggest fan.

02:38.041 --> 02:41.209
I'm his biggest fan.

02:41.277 --> 02:45.011
He was a 10-month baby.
He didn't want to leave.

02:50.084 --> 02:52.218
<i>I love your organic</i>
<i>restaurant, George.</i>

02:52.253 --> 02:54.988
Thank you, Ray.
And now let's toast to Jonathan

02:55.022 --> 02:56.656
and his wonderful new book.

02:56.690 --> 03:00.193
I'm not the only one who has
a reason to celebrate.

03:00.228 --> 03:02.596
- Ray.
- Oh, you got a job?

03:02.630 --> 03:04.364
No, nothing terrible like that.

03:04.398 --> 03:07.133
Remember the lesbian couple
in Ditmas Park

03:07.167 --> 03:08.767
that got pregnant
from my stolen sperm?

03:08.802 --> 03:12.471
Yes, that was and still is
very memorable.

03:12.505 --> 03:16.373
Well, they're getting a divorce and
I get to see my son one day a week.

03:16.408 --> 03:18.875
I meet him tomorrow.

03:18.910 --> 03:22.111
The nice mom decided that he
needed a male role model.

03:22.145 --> 03:23.845
Oh, that's fantastic.

03:23.879 --> 03:26.647
But I don't understand.
Your sperm was stolen?

03:26.681 --> 03:29.315
Did they take it from you
while you were sleeping?

03:29.350 --> 03:30.917
No, I put it in a cup.

03:30.984 --> 03:32.518
And they stole the cup?

03:39.525 --> 03:42.126
<i>I love the view, Jonathan.</i>

03:42.160 --> 03:43.594
But how can you
afford this place?

03:43.628 --> 03:46.228
Well, because of the clock,
everything trembles once an hour.

03:46.263 --> 03:48.163
It's why the rent is so cheap.

03:48.198 --> 03:49.999
It's like living in California
but in Brooklyn.

03:50.033 --> 03:53.535
Ray probably kept his sperm
in a fridge, don't you think?

03:53.570 --> 03:56.038
Yeah, I remember something about
having to keep it chilled.

03:56.072 --> 03:58.906
So what do you make of this
whole situation with Ray?

03:58.940 --> 04:02.208
- I think it's great.
- So you're not against sperm donation?

04:02.276 --> 04:04.343
Not at all.
I think it's a nice use of sperm.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.845
Ira, I don't think--

04:05.879 --> 04:08.580
Florence, I've been waiting
30 years for a good opening.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.348
What are you guys
talking about?

04:10.383 --> 04:13.618
Jonathan, I'm sterile.

04:13.652 --> 04:16.219
But there was never the
right moment to tell you.

04:16.254 --> 04:18.654
I never wanted you to think
I wasn't your father.

04:18.689 --> 04:22.058
I was too proud.
But hearing Ray's story--

04:22.091 --> 04:24.293
I don't understand.

04:24.328 --> 04:26.562
To conceive you

04:26.596 --> 04:28.363
we went to a sperm bank.

04:36.103 --> 04:38.237
I come from a sperm bank?

04:38.272 --> 04:41.174
Yes, it was in Fair Lawn

04:41.209 --> 04:43.109
near the Kosher Nosh
restaurant.

04:43.144 --> 04:45.078
You know, the place with
the wonderful kugel.

04:45.112 --> 04:46.579
Florence, that's not relevant.

04:46.613 --> 04:48.947
I can't believe this.

04:48.982 --> 04:51.350
Who's my father?

04:52.351 --> 04:54.619
All we know is
that he was Jewish

04:54.653 --> 04:57.888
and very bright,
which is what we requested.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.623
He was a member of Menscha.

04:59.657 --> 05:01.257
Menscha?

05:01.291 --> 05:03.392
He was a member of Mensa.

05:09.665 --> 05:12.633
And so I come from a sperm bank
in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

05:12.667 --> 05:16.170
At least the guy
was a member of Mensa.

05:16.205 --> 05:19.140
I always said
you were very bright.

05:19.174 --> 05:21.308
You know, the whole thing
was pretty emotional.

05:21.343 --> 05:23.710
I had to reassure my dad
that I'll always love him

05:23.744 --> 05:25.477
and I'll always think
of him as my father.

05:25.512 --> 05:27.579
Oh, good boy.
I'm so proud of you.

05:27.613 --> 05:29.980
If my daughter said
something like that to me

05:30.015 --> 05:32.548
I'd dissolve
and turn into mist.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.550
It is weird.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.953
All my life I've defined myself
by saying I'm not like my dad.

05:37.988 --> 05:40.422
But now that it's true,
I feel...

05:40.456 --> 05:42.390
Completely disoriented.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.794
I have to say I'm at a loss
as how to console you.

05:47.163 --> 05:49.897
- I'll pay for lunch.
- Thank you, George.

05:51.266 --> 05:53.199
Oh shit, George.
I'd better get going.

05:53.234 --> 05:56.235
I have a case. I have to follow a
woman off the 1:10 from Katonah.

05:56.270 --> 05:59.438
You know, I don't know
if it's the placebo effect,

05:59.473 --> 06:02.508
but I always feel so virile
after eating oysters.

06:02.542 --> 06:06.711
Like I should mount
a woman immediately.

06:08.246 --> 06:10.714
But you always feel that way.

06:15.519 --> 06:16.818
What do you think?

06:16.853 --> 06:19.823
Super Ray
versus X-Acto Man.

06:19.857 --> 06:23.260
Ray, you have to stop drawing that
stabbing over and over again.

06:23.294 --> 06:25.662
Why? It took Monica Seles
years to get over her stabbing

06:25.696 --> 06:27.664
and she was the number one
tennis player in the world.

06:27.698 --> 06:29.732
You're not Monica Seles.
You have to let it go.

06:31.768 --> 06:33.469
Okay.

06:33.503 --> 06:36.505
I think I'm just getting a little
overwhelmed about meeting Spencer.

06:36.539 --> 06:39.474
It'll be fine.
You're good with children.

06:39.508 --> 06:41.676
No I'm not.
I've always been bad with children.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.912
When I was little, kids
would call me gay Hueston.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.480
They hated me.
They'd say,

06:47.515 --> 06:50.382
"Hueston, we have a problem
because you're gay."

06:51.817 --> 06:53.384
It's why I became an artist.

06:57.354 --> 06:58.988
That's them.
That's them.

06:59.023 --> 07:00.823
You get the door, okay?
And just tell them

07:00.857 --> 07:03.691
that I have very bad diarrhea and that
I don't want Spencer to catch it.

07:03.726 --> 07:05.460
Ray, diarrhea
is not contagious.

07:05.494 --> 07:07.828
That is not true
and you know it.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.464
You're going to meet your son.

07:12.567 --> 07:13.967
- Hi.
- <i>Hi.</i>

07:14.001 --> 07:16.703
Hello.
Come on, Ray.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.305
Renee and Spencer are here.

07:19.340 --> 07:20.840
Is he wearing a red cape?

07:20.874 --> 07:24.410
Oh yes. He wanted to
look heroic for Spencer.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.979
- It's his alter ego.
- Oh, that's sweet.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.547
Is he all right?

07:28.581 --> 07:31.350
He's nervous and didn't sleep
well so he's overtired.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.519
So is Spencer. Maybe later you can
put them both down for a nap.

07:34.553 --> 07:37.321
Anyway, I'm gonna pick
him up at 6:00.

07:37.355 --> 07:39.823
- Come on, Ray.
- <i>No!</i>

07:39.857 --> 07:41.791
Ray, you have nothing
to be afraid of.

07:41.825 --> 07:45.728
Spencer is so excited to meet
you and spend the day with you.

07:45.763 --> 07:47.663
Really?

07:47.698 --> 07:49.431
Yeah, just keep him in
his regular routine--

07:49.466 --> 07:51.433
A walk, a nap, a bottle.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.435
Here, you hold him.

08:00.376 --> 08:02.443
I love you.

08:04.212 --> 08:07.481
My mark is supposed to be tall and
wearing a distinctive yellow hat.

08:07.515 --> 08:09.582
Is the hat distinctive
because it's yellow

08:09.617 --> 08:11.951
or is it yellow
and distinctive?

08:11.985 --> 08:14.085
I don't know.
Good point.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.487
I was hired over the phone. 
All the guy said was to follow

08:16.522 --> 08:18.589
her wherever she goes
and report where she lands.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.524
Sounds easy enough.
I'll help you for a while,

08:20.559 --> 08:22.392
but then I've got to go
meet my daughter.

08:22.427 --> 08:23.960
Did she find a place to live?

08:23.995 --> 08:26.429
Yeah, she and her new boyfriend
found a sublet down in Chelsea.

08:26.463 --> 08:28.598
I'm meeting him today as well.

08:28.666 --> 08:31.768
I hope I don't loathe
the kid immediately.

08:31.802 --> 08:35.270
That must be her.
That hat is yellow and distinctive.

08:35.304 --> 08:37.339
- Let's go.
- Oh my God, what a robust figure.

08:37.373 --> 08:38.974
It's like she has a cello
in that dress

08:39.008 --> 08:40.808
- George. Whoa whoa.
- I love this case.

08:40.842 --> 08:43.077
George, George.
Slow down, you'll tip her off.

08:43.111 --> 08:45.580
I want to get a better look.
I just had oysters.

08:45.614 --> 08:47.081
But you're not
being professional.

08:47.115 --> 08:48.848
I don't want
to be professional.

08:48.883 --> 08:50.950
Oh my God, what about her?
Let's follow her.

08:50.985 --> 08:52.952
- She's going towards my subway.
- George!

08:52.987 --> 08:55.487
The oysters are kicking in.
Good luck.

09:30.185 --> 09:33.454
Sorry.

09:38.693 --> 09:40.660
Come on, dude.

09:42.595 --> 09:45.530
Hey, you could have been a gentleman
and helped me open the door at least.

09:45.564 --> 09:47.698
- Fuck you, estrogen bomb.
- Estrogen?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.334
Spencer!

10:01.942 --> 10:04.209
Fuck it.

10:07.713 --> 10:09.613
More coffee,
Mr. Christopher?

10:09.648 --> 10:12.550
No, no thank you, Phillip.
Have you seen the new article?

10:12.584 --> 10:15.655
I saw it, Mr. Christopher.
But my name is Stephen.

10:15.689 --> 10:18.660
I've been with you
since you left "Edition."

10:18.694 --> 10:20.395
I am so sorry, Stephen.

10:20.430 --> 10:23.865
Because of the marijuana my whole
life is like that film "Memento."

10:23.900 --> 10:26.467
And I'm nervous.

10:26.502 --> 10:30.404
I'm seeing my daughter for
the first time in two years.

10:30.438 --> 10:32.739
Here she is.
Emily.

10:32.773 --> 10:34.974
Oh, hi daddy.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.710
My dear girl.
Oh, look at you.

10:37.744 --> 10:39.444
You are so beautiful.

10:39.479 --> 10:41.446
Oh, really?
I haven't put on weight?

10:41.481 --> 10:42.881
No no no no no.

10:42.915 --> 10:44.649
- Come on, let's sit down.
- Okay.

10:47.653 --> 10:50.955
All right, I want all
your headlines immediately.

10:50.989 --> 10:52.788
- Okay.
- But before you start,

10:52.823 --> 10:56.124
I just want to tell you
that I am so so so sorry

10:56.158 --> 10:58.792
that I've been a lousy father
for the past couple of years.

10:58.827 --> 11:00.560
I want us to be close again.

11:00.595 --> 11:03.963
No, I'm sorry I've been
a lousy daughter.

11:03.998 --> 11:05.765
No, you haven't been lousy.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.133
I'm the only one allowed
to feel guilty here.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.236
That's my job as a parent,
to feel inadequate.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.338
Okay, dad, you're inadequate.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.172
All right, give me
your headlines.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.608
- Okay, I'm--
- Wait wait wait. Hold the presses.

11:17.642 --> 11:20.343
Where's your new boyfriend?
I thought he was coming with you.

11:20.378 --> 11:22.278
Oh yeah. He's out
running errands for me.

11:22.346 --> 11:25.848
We like to pretend that he's my dog.
It's our fun little thing.

11:25.883 --> 11:29.118
Well, that sounds good,
I guess.

11:29.152 --> 11:31.486
I mean, dogs are loyal, right?

11:31.521 --> 11:33.554
- Where'd you meet him?
- At a seance.

11:33.589 --> 11:36.924
We were trying to communicate with
the original designer of Fiestaware.

11:36.958 --> 11:39.326
I went with my
A.A. Sponsor, Sophie.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.561
Wait wait, slow down,
sweetheart.

11:41.595 --> 11:44.397
- You're in A.A.?
- Mm-hmm.

11:44.431 --> 11:47.332
- When did this happen?
- About nine months ago.

11:47.367 --> 11:49.034
I was drinking a lot.

11:49.068 --> 11:51.636
But mostly I was just
becoming a pot-head.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.738
Like you used to be
when I was a kid.

11:53.772 --> 11:56.173
Well, yes.
That-- that is true.

11:56.207 --> 11:59.309
I was a pot-head...
Back then.

11:59.343 --> 12:02.312
But anyway, I'm so glad
that you're sober.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.114
So what about you?

12:04.148 --> 12:07.017
Why did you open this elitist,
artisanal restaurant?

12:07.051 --> 12:10.821
Well, it's kind of
my new canvas, you know?

12:10.855 --> 12:13.056
It's like the magazine
but with steak frites.

12:13.091 --> 12:15.325
Oh, have you seen this article?

12:15.360 --> 12:18.829
- You're gonna get a kick out of it.
- Ooh, there's Bernard.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.531
Bernard, over here.
Here, boy.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.567
Here, boy.

12:26.603 --> 12:28.504
Hi.

13:07.136 --> 13:09.837
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Ames here, your detective.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.505
The woman in the yellow hat

13:11.540 --> 13:14.174
is in room 1527
of the Iroquois Hotel.

13:14.209 --> 13:15.809
<i>Got it.</i>

13:15.844 --> 13:17.778
Speaking of the woman
in the yellow hat,

13:17.812 --> 13:19.679
did you ever read
the Curious George books?

13:19.714 --> 13:22.582
I loved them when I was a kid.

13:29.357 --> 13:32.259
What's going on here?
I heard a scream.

13:32.293 --> 13:34.027
Well, actually two screams.

13:40.701 --> 13:43.836
You've got to stop crying.
Shh.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.804
Shh.

13:45.838 --> 13:48.206
It's okay.

13:49.608 --> 13:51.275
- Shh.
- <i>Hello?</i>

13:51.309 --> 13:52.676
- Mom.
- <i>Hey, Ray.</i>

13:52.711 --> 13:54.711
The baby won't stop crying.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.280
What do I do?
Leah's out with the girls.

13:57.315 --> 14:00.016
<i>Put some whiskey on a nipple.
</i> <i>That's what I used to do</i> <i>for you.</i>

14:00.050 --> 14:01.584
- Really?
- <i>Sure.</i>

14:01.618 --> 14:03.552
It's amazing
I'm not an alcoholic.

14:03.586 --> 14:06.288
- <i>You're not?</i>
- Mom, God.

14:06.322 --> 14:08.189
Shh.
It's okay.

14:08.224 --> 14:10.758
It's okay.

14:10.793 --> 14:14.061
It's okay.
Shh.

14:14.095 --> 14:16.629
Shh.
All right.

14:26.105 --> 14:28.238
There's no nipple.

14:28.273 --> 14:30.640
It's a goddamn sippy cup.

14:52.227 --> 14:55.162
I used to cry a lot too
when I was a kid.

14:55.197 --> 14:58.398
But sometimes you have to
just suck it up, okay?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.808
See this?

15:09.842 --> 15:13.511
Take this, go like this.
Right?

15:16.615 --> 15:18.515
It's okay.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.151
It's okay.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.120
Shh.

15:37.966 --> 15:40.501
Not bad.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.722
Oh my God.

16:10.526 --> 16:11.860
Hello?

16:15.964 --> 16:18.098
Please don't be dead.
Please don't be dead.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.901
Please don't be dead.

16:21.437 --> 16:24.472
Dead.

16:24.506 --> 16:26.874
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

16:26.908 --> 16:29.110
Oh my God.

16:29.144 --> 16:31.512
I've been framed.

16:31.546 --> 16:34.681
Why are my pants at my ankles?

16:49.524 --> 16:50.890
Ah! Oh my God!
I'm sorry.

16:50.925 --> 16:53.092
Are you okay?
I mean...

17:12.644 --> 17:15.313
<i>Police, open up.</i>

17:17.749 --> 17:20.251
<i>Open up, police.</i>

17:20.286 --> 17:22.053
Ah! Shh!

17:22.087 --> 17:25.422
Please don't scream.
I'm not here to molest you.

17:25.457 --> 17:28.993
I mean, you're very beautiful.

17:29.027 --> 17:30.894
Go back into the bathroom,
come out in two minutes

17:30.929 --> 17:32.963
and I'll be gone, okay?

17:40.839 --> 17:42.706
Goodbye.
Thank you.

17:51.748 --> 17:55.317
So did you have fun
with your superhero daddy?

17:55.351 --> 17:57.452
"Yes I did.
I love being with daddy.

17:57.487 --> 17:59.221
I want to be with
him all the time."

17:59.255 --> 18:02.691
Uh-oh, I think somebody
might need a diaper change.

18:03.993 --> 18:06.928
I'm sorry, does he--
does he smell like booze?

18:06.962 --> 18:09.864
No, I don't think so.

18:09.898 --> 18:12.333
Maybe he snuck a drink earlier.
You know kids.

18:12.367 --> 18:15.370
Well, I'd better get him
over to my ex's house.

18:15.404 --> 18:17.272
She can change his diaper.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.541
That's one of the benefits
of divorce.

18:19.575 --> 18:22.711
Now that you've been cut loose,

18:22.746 --> 18:25.782
have you been getting
a lot of puss?

18:25.816 --> 18:27.451
Yeah, it's actually okay.

18:27.485 --> 18:30.320
You know, I was never
single in Brooklyn before.

18:30.355 --> 18:33.056
It's kind of wonderful.
It's kind of like college.

18:33.091 --> 18:36.393
You know, a lot of girls,
a lot of-- lot of puss.

18:36.427 --> 18:39.329
Hmm. Guess it gives
a new meaning

18:39.363 --> 18:41.064
to the phrase
"gay divorcee."

18:41.098 --> 18:44.533
Right. So I guess we'll
see you next week, Ray?

18:44.567 --> 18:47.035
Great. Do remember to have
your ex change him right away.

18:47.069 --> 18:48.736
If he's anything
like his old man,

18:48.770 --> 18:52.505
he has a sensitive tushy.
Right, little guy?

18:52.539 --> 18:54.539
Oh, good to know.

18:54.574 --> 18:57.041
- Okay
- Bye, Spencer.

18:57.076 --> 18:58.643
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:58.678 --> 19:00.745
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

19:00.779 --> 19:03.348
Bye, Spencer.

19:03.382 --> 19:06.516
Bye, Spencer.
Spencer.

19:06.551 --> 19:08.551
Spencer!

19:10.586 --> 19:12.487
And so I'm living
right upstairs.

19:12.521 --> 19:14.022
There's even a dumbwaiter.

19:14.056 --> 19:16.691
So if I want, they can send
my meals right up the chute.

19:16.725 --> 19:18.860
I want a dumbwaiter.

19:18.894 --> 19:21.229
George, I keep noticing
the staff down here

19:21.263 --> 19:23.231
is serving telephones?

19:23.265 --> 19:25.767
Yes, I've banned cell phones
from the restaurant.

19:25.801 --> 19:28.235
But if you have an emergency,

19:28.270 --> 19:31.071
you can have a telephone
plugged in at your table.

19:31.105 --> 19:34.207
Why the ban, daddy?
You love texting.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.009
Well, we are organic.

19:36.076 --> 19:38.510
And lately with all the "pods"

19:38.545 --> 19:41.113
and "pads" I'm feeling
choked by technology.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.181
I even started getting
emails in my mind.

19:43.215 --> 19:45.382
You know I was working
on brain emails,

19:45.417 --> 19:48.284
I was gonna call them
bmails, at my company

19:48.319 --> 19:50.486
before I sold everything
to Microsoft.

19:50.521 --> 19:54.223
My beautiful genius lover.

19:58.861 --> 20:00.628
Sal.

20:00.663 --> 20:01.930
Hey, Sal.

20:01.964 --> 20:05.433
Sal, can I have the--
Thank you.

20:05.467 --> 20:08.369
Daddy, where's the ladies' room?
I need to drain my lizard.

20:08.403 --> 20:10.538
It's down to the right,
sweetheart.

20:15.743 --> 20:17.943
Ah.

20:17.944 --> 20:21.076
- I'm smitten, George.
- I can see that.

20:21.110 --> 20:24.477
But I have to be straight
with you about something..

20:24.511 --> 20:26.712
You are too old for Emily.

20:26.746 --> 20:29.781
That's not true, George.

20:29.816 --> 20:32.218
No, life is being extended.

20:32.252 --> 20:33.819
Something is happening.

20:33.854 --> 20:36.221
Especially for those of us
in the upper income brackets.

20:36.222 --> 20:38.924
Don't you feel unusually young?

20:38.959 --> 20:40.726
Yes, actually I do.

20:40.761 --> 20:43.097
But I'm talking about
my daughter.

20:43.132 --> 20:44.667
So am I.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.802
I've fallen in love with Emily
and I want to marry her.

20:47.837 --> 20:49.904
I would like your permission.

20:49.938 --> 20:51.772
I want to be your son-in-law.

20:51.806 --> 20:54.106
Marry?
Are you delusional?

20:54.140 --> 20:55.441
Sometimes.

20:55.475 --> 20:57.142
But about this I have clarity.

20:57.176 --> 21:00.278
Well, what if I were to say no?

21:00.312 --> 21:02.446
I think you'd make
Emily terribly unhappy.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.347
She wanted me to ask you first.

21:04.382 --> 21:06.416
Your approval
is very important to her.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.418
Is this the kind of thing
that I could think about?

21:39.671 --> 21:41.972
Ah.

21:42.007 --> 21:45.642
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

21:52.415 --> 21:54.349
Yes, can I please speak
to George Christopher?

21:54.384 --> 21:57.485
Oh, Sal.
I'm so upset about my daughter.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.754
I'll have one more.
But that'll be the last one.

22:02.457 --> 22:04.925
You have a phone call,
Mr. Christopher.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.261
Oh, thank you, Richard.

22:06.295 --> 22:08.697
It's Stephen,
Mr. Christopher.

22:08.731 --> 22:11.634
- I don't know a Stephen.
- No, it's Jonathan.

22:11.668 --> 22:14.136
Oh, sorry.
Thank you, Jonathan.

22:14.170 --> 22:17.139
- Hello, Stephen.
- <i>George?</i>

22:17.173 --> 22:19.208
<i>Hello, George?</i>

22:19.242 --> 22:21.176
Oh dear.

22:21.211 --> 22:22.678
Hello?

22:28.216 --> 22:30.017
Police, open up.

22:32.086 --> 22:34.387
Not again.

22:39.993 --> 22:43.194
Jonathan Ames, if you're
in there, open the door.

22:53.507 --> 22:56.975
<i>Jonathan Ames,</i>
<i>open the door.</i>

23:06.218 --> 23:07.986
Leah, today with Spencer

23:08.021 --> 23:10.056
was one of the best days
of my life.

23:10.090 --> 23:13.025
I felt needed.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.624
It's like being with
Jonathan but better.

23:15.659 --> 23:17.592
Ray, that's beautiful.

23:19.294 --> 23:21.728
It's different being a dad.

23:21.763 --> 23:24.930
Most of the time lately
I feel like I've been

23:24.965 --> 23:27.900
sleepwalking my way
through life.

23:29.769 --> 23:31.670
Like I really wasn't here,
you know?

23:31.704 --> 23:34.038
That's how you feel
when you're with me?

23:34.073 --> 23:36.007
No, not with you.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.909
I just only see you at night now that
you're working most of the time.

23:38.944 --> 23:41.612
So it's when you're alone
that you feel this way?

23:41.646 --> 23:44.114
Yeah, but today I felt...

23:44.148 --> 23:46.983
Completely awake,

23:47.018 --> 23:49.886
like my heart
was as big as the moon.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.255
I just love that little kid.
I'd do anything for him.

23:53.289 --> 23:55.523
Ray, I'm so proud of you.

23:55.558 --> 23:57.859
And even if you feel
lost sometimes,

23:57.893 --> 24:00.761
you've been doing a wonderful
job running the house for me.

24:00.795 --> 24:02.729
Yeah, I know.
I'm good at it.

24:02.764 --> 24:06.199
I guess I've become
a real Park Slope mom.

24:07.234 --> 24:09.768
A hot Park Slope mom.

24:15.974 --> 24:17.375
Get the lube.

24:17.409 --> 24:19.212
Really?

24:19.246 --> 24:21.683
Would you like me to shower first?
I know you like me to be clean.

24:21.717 --> 24:24.718
- No, I'm ready now.
- I love you, Leah.

24:32.858 --> 24:34.492
Where is it?

24:35.928 --> 24:38.529
Oh yeah.

24:38.563 --> 24:41.532
Oh God.

24:41.566 --> 24:43.100
It's Jonathan.

24:43.134 --> 24:45.402
This'll only take a second.
No backing out!

24:47.372 --> 24:50.274
Jonathan, I don't appreciate
such a late phone call.

24:50.309 --> 24:52.677
<i>Do you know</i> <i>what time it is?</i>

24:52.712 --> 24:54.780
11:15.

24:54.814 --> 24:57.016
No, actually 11:16.

24:57.050 --> 24:59.718
Ah!

25:04.391 --> 25:06.426
Ray.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.728
Help.
