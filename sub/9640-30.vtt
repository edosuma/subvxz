WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:03.600
Squeeze,
squeeze, squeeze.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.100
[grunting]

00:05.100 --> 00:08.700
And that's how you turn
lemons into lemonade.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.000
And what is magical
about that?

00:14.000 --> 00:17.133
Nothing, but it tastes great.

00:17.133 --> 00:20.000
All right. Who's ready
for today's wizard lesson?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.767
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21.767 --> 00:23.834
I can only learn
one new thing a week,

00:23.834 --> 00:26.133
so I guess I'll just see
you guys next week. Great.

00:26.133 --> 00:27.600
Ah-ah-ah.

00:29.033 --> 00:31.900
- [all] Uncle Kelbo!
- Hey, everybody!

00:31.900 --> 00:35.600
You're not gonna believe this,
but I just discovered America.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.734
You should have seen
Columbus' face

00:38.734 --> 00:42.500
as he sailed up, and I was
waiting there for him
looking like this.

00:44.033 --> 00:48.000
- I thought I heard Kelbo.
- You heard right.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.200
- Nice outfit.
- Well, thank you.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.667
Can you stand outside the
restaurant and hand out menus?

00:52.667 --> 00:55.567
Actually, no, I cannot.

00:55.567 --> 01:00.233
I'm spending all my time using
my magic while I still have it.

01:00.233 --> 01:01.500
What are you
talking about?

01:01.500 --> 01:05.500
I got a letter
from the Wizard Council.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.600
There's some sort
of technicality,

01:07.600 --> 01:11.300
and we have to take
our wizard test again.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.834
All of us.

01:12.834 --> 01:16.000
You, me,
and somebody else.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.233
- All of us?
- Who's "all of us?"

01:19.233 --> 01:22.133
- No one.
- OK, we're not four years old.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.400
We know that
"no one" means someone.

01:26.467 --> 01:29.133
Kelbo and I have a sister.
You guys have an aunt.

01:29.133 --> 01:30.300
Oh, I knew it!

01:30.300 --> 01:33.500
- I didn't know it.
- Hold on.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.300
How come you guys never
told us we had an aunt?

01:37.300 --> 01:41.200
When I won the wizard
competition and gave
my powers to Kelbo,

01:41.200 --> 01:44.900
she got mad and wanted
nothing to do with our family
ever again.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.734
- Which is fine with me.
- Not fine with me.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.934
The wizard auditor's
gonna be here on Friday.

01:49.934 --> 01:52.700
And if Meg is not here
to retake that test,

01:52.700 --> 01:56.300
the Russos will
lose their powers forever.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.567
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:59.567 --> 02:03.300
Are you telling me that my kids
might lose their powers, too?

02:03.300 --> 02:04.700
Hm-hmm.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.934
Oh, no. This is...
This is bad.

02:07.934 --> 02:09.834
We're gonna have to find
a way to get her back here

02:09.834 --> 02:11.367
so she can retake the test.

02:11.367 --> 02:13.767
The problem is
nobody knows where she is.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.100
Well, we're gonna
have to find her then.

02:17.567 --> 02:20.400
I have a magnifying glass.
Will that help?

02:22.100 --> 02:24.467
She's not tiny.

02:24.467 --> 02:27.133
But you said
she was an ant.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.367
Dad, we've got
to do something.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.667
We all know that I was
the one that was gonna win.

02:32.667 --> 02:36.367
I know. And you worked
really hard, too.
You must feel terrible.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.300
Suddenly slacker girl
over here

02:40.300 --> 02:43.900
isn't looking so dumb
anymore is she?

03:36.667 --> 03:39.800
I can't find
a Megan Russo anywhere
on the World Wide Wiz Web.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.500
OK, well, how are
you spelling "Russo?"

03:42.500 --> 03:46.867
Sometimes I'm in a hurry
and I don't use any "S's."

03:46.867 --> 03:50.133
Uh, hey. Once you
all lose your powers,

03:50.133 --> 03:54.667
we should use the Wizards' Lair
as a quiet room just for Mom.

03:54.667 --> 03:58.233
- What's a quiet room?
- You'll never know.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.400
Theresa, we're trying
to figure out a way

04:01.400 --> 04:02.834
for the kids not
to lose their magic.

04:02.834 --> 04:05.133
Is there anything you guys
can tell me about Aunt Megan

04:05.133 --> 04:08.100
- to help me find her?
- Whoo, I know.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.867
I know when your dad
first introduced me

04:09.867 --> 04:12.834
as the girl he was
giving away his powers for,

04:12.834 --> 04:18.100
she threw my homemade empanadas
off the terrace and hit a cop.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.700
So Aunt Megan
has a police record.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.200
- [clearing throat]
- [button beeping]

04:23.200 --> 04:26.000
Found her! Found her!

04:26.000 --> 04:28.900
Megan Brooke Russo.
She lives in Paris.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.400
Paris? She sounds German.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.900
Dad, don't you think
you should go apologize

04:36.900 --> 04:38.600
and convince her
to take the retest?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.033
Absolutely.

04:40.033 --> 04:43.233
I'm going to go over there
and make her take that test,

04:43.233 --> 04:46.233
or I'm going to sit on her,
look her in the eye

04:46.233 --> 04:49.800
and dangle a loogie
right over her face.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.000
That's how I got her
to do things when we were kids.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Uh, it'd be better
if just you guys go.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.967
All right, let's go.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.867
Wait, Alex, let me do it.
I never get to do it.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.700
[groaning]
All right, fine.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.600
Let's go to our new aunt's.
Take us to Paris, Texas.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.600
[together] What?

05:12.700 --> 05:14.467
[rock music plays]

05:16.500 --> 05:19.100
See? This is why we don't
let you do the spells, Max.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.000
[clearing throat]

05:25.000 --> 05:28.900
Hi, uh...
Are you Megan Russo?

05:28.900 --> 05:30.767
Yeah.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.600
We're Jerry Russo's kids.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.500
Oooh.
I'm not Megan Russo.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.767
Wha...?

05:39.767 --> 05:43.000
Well, we gave it a shot.
Let's go.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.967
Yes, I'm convinced,

05:44.967 --> 05:46.834
since your paintings say,

05:46.834 --> 05:49.834
"M. Russo" and
your smock says "Megan."

05:52.600 --> 05:54.767
OK, I'm your aunt.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.834
Let's do all
the aunt stuff.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.734
Wow, I haven't seen you
in so long. You're so tall.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.000
When did the cast come off?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.500
That was fun.
Have a great trip back.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.300
You're kicking us out?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.567
You're still that upset
with your brothers?

06:09.567 --> 06:13.100
[scoffing] No, I'm not upset.
I've totally let it go.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.600
Then, what's this?

06:17.934 --> 06:20.500
Oh, it's the latest
in my series,

06:20.500 --> 06:24.834
called "Every Russo for
Themselves." [giggling]

06:24.834 --> 06:28.300
Wow. She really knows
how to hold a grudge.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.967
Sounds like
someone else we know.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.700
Don't look at me like that.
I'm still mad at you

06:33.700 --> 06:36.767
for the last time
you said I hold a grudge.

06:36.767 --> 06:41.600
OK, great. Thanks for stopping
in. Have a great trip back.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.834
I need to get back
to doing a lot of nothing.

06:43.834 --> 06:46.100
Wow. Alex, you do
a lot of nothing.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.467
You know, she's like
your weird, older-looking twin.

06:49.467 --> 06:52.100
No offense.

06:52.100 --> 06:55.300
You remind me of a brother
I used to have named Kelbo.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.300
Really? I have
an uncle named Kelbo.

06:58.300 --> 07:01.100
Couldn't be the same guy.
My Kelbo is an uncle,

07:01.100 --> 07:02.600
and yours is a brother.

07:03.667 --> 07:06.000
Yep. You're just
like him.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.667
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

07:09.667 --> 07:13.200
- Thank you.
- It was an insult.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.133
Thank you.

07:16.867 --> 07:20.600
Aunt Megan, you need
to come back with us.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.000
You and your brothers need
to retake the wizard exam.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.500
It's the only way the
Russo family can save
its wizarding powers.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.000
What do I care
about wizard powers?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.867
Look, I don't
know if you heard,

07:30.867 --> 07:33.667
but I got totally jacked
in the wizard competition.

07:33.667 --> 07:36.600
Look, we all know
what happened to you, OK?
Yes, it was bad.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.100
This can be your one chance
to win your powers back.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.867
Yay, we all love power!

07:40.867 --> 07:44.100
And we also heard how
unfairly you were treated.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.233
- Yes.
- And how...

07:46.233 --> 07:50.000
...my dad and uncle want
to apologize to you for that.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.367
- Yep. That's what they said.
- Aunt Megan.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.734
Would you mind
taking Max on a tour?

07:57.734 --> 08:00.100
- Don't let him touch anything.
- [canvas ripping]

08:00.100 --> 08:02.400
[chuckles] Too late.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.500
You can't really
lean on these.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.500
Alex!
What are you doing?

08:12.500 --> 08:15.834
Dad said he was never
going to apologize to her.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.233
I'm winging it.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.133
Well, what are you
gonna do if she says yes,

08:19.133 --> 08:22.100
and comes back with us,
and then they won't apologize?

08:22.100 --> 08:24.100
Then I'll wing it again.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.600
The important thing
is not the truth,

08:26.600 --> 08:27.734
it's getting her back.

08:27.734 --> 08:30.233
So, how about it,
Aunt Megan?

08:30.233 --> 08:32.567
Dad and Uncle Kelbo
are ready to get on their knees

08:32.567 --> 08:34.567
and beg for your
forgiveness.

08:34.567 --> 08:37.967
Well, I wouldn't
mind seeing that.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.367
Especially because
I thought I never would.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.767
Winging it never fails.

08:49.233 --> 08:52.233
Is this place a sandwich shop
or a subway stop?

08:52.233 --> 08:55.000
Let me guess.
It was your dad's idea.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.100
Megan. Wow, you're here.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.500
Yep, I'm here.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.233
Nice job combining
two of your favorite things:

09:07.233 --> 09:09.700
railroad travel
and eating.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.400
[scoffing] Shows how
much you don't know me.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.967
My two favorite things now

09:13.967 --> 09:16.600
are baking my own pie crusts
and knitting.

09:19.400 --> 09:24.233
I'm just going to move
this breakable stuff
out of the way.

09:24.233 --> 09:28.100
You know,
get it out of reach.

09:29.967 --> 09:33.500
Wow. I never thought I'd see
the day you'd come back here.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.967
When I heard what you were going
to do, how could I miss it?

09:36.967 --> 09:39.600
- What?
- What do you mean "what?"

09:39.600 --> 09:40.700
[grunting]

09:40.700 --> 09:44.200
Start winging it,
Captain Flappers.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.700
Captain Flappers?

09:46.700 --> 09:48.600
I'll think of something better.
Just go.

09:50.233 --> 09:54.467
Uh, Daddy, Aunt Megan was really
excited to hear how much you
missed her.

09:54.467 --> 09:57.734
And how you feel really,
really bad about what happened.

09:57.734 --> 09:59.400
Really?

10:01.033 --> 10:03.100
'Cause that doesn't sound
like Megan at all.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.400
Look, I'm just
going to cut to it:

10:05.400 --> 10:07.467
I was told you'd be
on your knees for this.

10:07.467 --> 10:10.500
- She's just like you.
- No, she's not.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.033
The only way I'm
getting on my knees

10:13.033 --> 10:14.934
is if I'm sitting on you,

10:14.934 --> 10:17.567
dangling a loogie
over your face.

10:17.567 --> 10:21.600
Then why did I even come to your
stupid restaurant-slash-train
station?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.200
It's a sub shop.

10:25.033 --> 10:28.600
- Just like you.
- I don't see it.

10:30.867 --> 10:31.934
Hey, everybody.

10:31.934 --> 10:33.200
Congratulate me.

10:33.200 --> 10:38.100
I just won the Indianapolis 500
in the year 2092.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.133
Place your bets now.
I was a longshot.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.700
Oh, my... Megan!
It's Megan.

10:46.700 --> 10:52.033
I remember you.
You're my sister.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.500
- Wow.
- Hi, Kelbo.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.300
I can't believe you got her
to come back to take the test.

10:57.300 --> 11:01.900
- Not without an apology.
- Well, OK. Go ahead.

11:03.400 --> 11:08.767
Um, no, Kelbo. She wants
us to apologize to her.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.100
What for?

11:10.100 --> 11:13.600
For giving your powers
to him instead of me.

11:14.834 --> 11:18.233
OK, this is clearly
between the two of you, OK?

11:18.233 --> 11:22.834
Who wants to go with their uncle
fishing for llamas?

11:22.834 --> 11:25.000
Kelbo!

11:25.000 --> 11:27.367
Megan, you know I had to
give him my powers

11:27.367 --> 11:28.800
because he
needed them more.

11:28.800 --> 11:34.000
Kelbo's life without magic
would be a travesty.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.100
A horrible travesty.

11:36.100 --> 11:39.900
That's why I like to spend
all my time appreciating
what I've got,

11:39.900 --> 11:41.667
and going fishing for llamas!

11:43.900 --> 11:48.567
Aunt Megan, this can be your one
chance to win your powers back.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.500
I'm apologizing for them.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.734
Sorry!
Please retake the test.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.400
Why should I?

11:56.400 --> 11:59.300
Jerry will still win
and give his powers to Kelbo,

11:59.300 --> 12:03.000
and all of my hard work
will be for nothing.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.600
And I really
don't like hard work.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.934
Oh, my gosh,
she is just like me.

12:09.934 --> 12:13.767
- Kelbo, send me home.
- You got it.

12:13.767 --> 12:19.600
Zooba, zooba, zooba, hey sister,
go sister, Paris, Texas.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.900
- Alex, what did you do?
- She winged it, Dad.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.367
And I specifically
told you not to wing it.

12:27.367 --> 12:30.367
Hey, I got her here.
If you don't like winging it,
what do you got?

12:30.367 --> 12:33.000
I don't know, but there's
gotta be something we can do.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.400
[all sighing]

12:35.400 --> 12:37.100
What if we hired
a wizard lawyer?

12:37.100 --> 12:39.834
Maybe he can find a loophole
so we can keep our powers.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.934
I know just the guy.
He's fantastic!

12:44.400 --> 12:47.200
The best fish lawyer
in the business.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.934
I'm telling ya,
this guy's a shark.

12:50.934 --> 12:52.300
No offense.

12:54.567 --> 12:57.033
OK. Mr. Fish...

13:00.600 --> 13:02.567
We had a transfer
of power indiscretion,

13:02.567 --> 13:04.200
and our aunt
won't take the retest.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.100
- Is there any legal solution?
- [gurgling noises]

13:08.100 --> 13:09.700
[sighing] We're toast.

13:11.867 --> 13:15.233
Hey, I don't want to be
insensitive, but how long
do you think

13:15.233 --> 13:18.100
it will take to get all
this wizard junk out of here?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.734
Oh, that was insensitive, huh?

13:22.734 --> 13:27.300
OK, looks like it's over.
I'm heading to Atlantic City.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.300
You, my friend, get the hotel
room. I'll get the plane ticket.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.500
[shouts indistinctly]

13:33.200 --> 13:35.600
Go ahead, Mom.
Make it your quiet room.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.567
There's no need for a
wizard training area anymore,

13:38.567 --> 13:43.033
because the competition
is over. Right, Alex?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.400
[sighing] I really
messed up, Harper.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.567
My family could lose our wizard
powers because of what I did.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.700
I'm probably gonna end up
like my Aunt Megan,

13:55.700 --> 13:58.200
with nobody in my family
wanting anything to do with me.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.967
Then I've got this covered.
Here's what you do.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.967
Get a small refrigerator
in your room,

14:02.967 --> 14:05.467
and then be best friends with
someone whose family you like

14:05.467 --> 14:07.967
and spend all of your time
at their house.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.233
Alex, honey, grab your wand.
I want you to take me somewhere.

14:14.233 --> 14:17.767
Really? You never want
anything to do with magic.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.000
Wait a minute.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.500
You're not dropping me off
at boarding school, are you?

14:22.500 --> 14:24.500
I never thought it
would be you, Mom.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.867
I will not let you
do it, Mrs. Russo.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.500
Standing up to you
is really tough for me,

14:29.500 --> 14:31.367
because this is the
only place I have to go.

14:31.367 --> 14:34.000
Harper, honey, relax!

14:34.000 --> 14:37.033
I'm not sending Alex away. I
just need to show her something.

14:37.033 --> 14:41.000
OK... [groaning]
I hate traveling by wand.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Makes my ears pop
and my ankles swell.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.500
I hate it, too.
I hear stuff and I taste metal.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.600
I know.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.000
Wait till they
turn you invisible.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.900
None of your clothes
fit right after that.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.200
Really, Mom, this was
urgent a minute ago, so...

14:55.200 --> 14:57.033
Oh, you're right.
Let's go.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.934
Oy! [speaks Spanish]

15:07.700 --> 15:11.100
- What do you want?
- [yelling] Look, Megan!

15:11.100 --> 15:14.300
I'm sorry. I can't
hear very well right now,

15:14.300 --> 15:16.500
but just listen to me, OK?

15:16.500 --> 15:19.200
I know that you don't get
along with your brothers,

15:19.200 --> 15:20.967
and that's your business.

15:20.967 --> 15:25.367
But now, it's affecting my kids,
and that's my business.

15:25.367 --> 15:29.834
OK? Wait a minute.
[gasping]

15:31.300 --> 15:33.233
My ears just popped.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.500
Look, Theresa,
I'm not going back there.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.100
There's too much bad blood
between me and my brothers.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.600
There's nothing
I can do for you.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.100
Don't you even care
that Justin, Max, and I

15:46.100 --> 15:47.400
are going to
lose our powers?

15:47.400 --> 15:50.400
[scoffing]
You'll be OK without magic.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.967
- I am.
- Uh, no, you're not.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.567
You live alone on a roof.

15:54.567 --> 15:58.300
Mom, it's in Paris.
It's beautiful.
Look at the view.

15:58.300 --> 16:01.000
Shh. It's still sad.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.500
Look, Megan, you're
a miserable, bitter mortal.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.734
You have no family.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.600
You want to know why Alex
will be OK without magic?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.600
Because she has
her family.

16:15.133 --> 16:18.300
You got schooled!

16:18.300 --> 16:20.734
- Alex, watch your mouth.
- Oh, sorry.

16:20.734 --> 16:23.400
Well, you just wasted
your time by coming here.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.567
Wow, maybe I did.

16:30.233 --> 16:33.800
I'm sorry I couldn't
be more help, Alex.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.667
No, Mom. You did help.

16:35.667 --> 16:38.834
I'm not gonna
let magic do this to us.

16:38.834 --> 16:42.567
And, Aunt Megan, I have a
suggestion for your painting.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.767
Now you're the one
being chased by a shark.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.000
Buh-bye.

16:58.567 --> 17:00.667
Guys, we gotta talk...

17:00.667 --> 17:01.967
...about a lot of things.

17:01.967 --> 17:04.300
No, we don't.
We're done talking to you.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.500
We're packing.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.700
Don't you see what
this is doing to us?

17:08.700 --> 17:10.667
We haven't even finished
the wizard competition,

17:10.667 --> 17:13.200
and we're already fighting
like Dad, Kelbo and Megan.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.100
Since when have you ever cared
about the wizard competition?

17:16.100 --> 17:18.100
Since I figured out it was
tearing us apart.

17:19.133 --> 17:21.133
Guys, do you know
what we need to do?

17:21.133 --> 17:23.300
We need to put aside our
differences, come together,

17:23.300 --> 17:26.567
and show the Wizard Council that
the Russos aren't going to take
this lying down.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.834
Continue.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.500
Sure, we annoy each other.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.567
And sure, you're probably not
going to amount to anything.

17:36.033 --> 17:39.100
Sure, I might end up along
the side of the highway,

17:39.100 --> 17:41.000
wearing an orange jumpsuit
picking up trash.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.967
But you know what
I like to call that?

17:45.133 --> 17:46.934
I like to call
that "family."

17:49.200 --> 17:51.400
If there's one thing
I've learned about family,

17:51.400 --> 17:54.033
it's that if we stick together,
nothing can hurt us.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.500
Well, we're gonna lose
our powers anyway,

17:57.500 --> 17:59.100
so what else
do we have to lose?

17:59.100 --> 18:00.967
- Yeah! Let's do it.
- All right. OK.

18:00.967 --> 18:02.233
Bring on
the Wizard Council!

18:02.233 --> 18:04.200
OK, guys, I'm gonna
get a bunch of rest.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.967
It's gonna be a big, long,
emotional day tomorrow.

18:07.967 --> 18:10.934
- Wait, tomorrow?
- Yeah.

18:10.934 --> 18:12.734
So that's not today?

18:14.100 --> 18:17.600
No, tomorrow. The day
the wizard auditor's coming.

18:17.600 --> 18:22.233
All right, do you guys want to
meet earlier before he gets here

18:22.233 --> 18:24.100
and then we can
redo this whole moment,

18:24.100 --> 18:26.033
or we can just remember
that it happened?

18:26.033 --> 18:28.000
Yeah, no, we're good.
All right, let's go.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.233
I am here to administer
a retest to, uh,

18:32.233 --> 18:35.600
Jerry, Megan and... Kelbo?

18:35.600 --> 18:38.467
Uh, Mr. McFly? Our sister,
Megan, is not gonna be here.

18:38.467 --> 18:40.100
Oh, then this is gonna be quick.

18:40.100 --> 18:44.700
Where's your wizard power panel?
I need to take the fuses.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.133
Um, I don't
recall where that is.

18:50.133 --> 18:54.000
- It's right here.
- Oh, this?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.600
This is our decoy panel to,
you know...

18:58.834 --> 19:00.734
Are you the wizard
competition auditor?

19:00.734 --> 19:03.600
- Yes.
- We quit.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
Time out.

19:08.834 --> 19:11.367
- What are you doing?
- I'm winging it.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.500
You gave a big
inspirational speech for that?

19:14.500 --> 19:17.500
Well, first of all, thank you
for remembering my speech.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.734
And second of all, you're
family and you're gonna
wing it with me.

19:21.734 --> 19:24.300
- [sighing]
- We're behind you,
General Flappers.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.667
Would you stop saying that?
I wasn't happy with it.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.200
OK, hands in.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.467
- One, two, three...
- [all] Russos!

19:33.600 --> 19:36.033
Time in!

19:36.033 --> 19:38.233
Ever since
this re-test came up,

19:38.233 --> 19:41.000
I've learned a little
something about us Russos.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.467
We don't need powers
to make us a family,

19:43.467 --> 19:45.934
and we're not gonna let
wizard powers break us apart.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.900
And my brothers
are behind me.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.000
You know what?
She's right.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.500
I don't want to end up losing
these guys. I quit, too.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.967
Alex had a great speech
yesterday,

19:57.967 --> 20:00.867
and the parts that
I remember were very moving.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.367
I quit, too.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.200
Yay, family!

20:07.200 --> 20:09.667
I'm proud of you kids
for sticking together.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.200
Well, I guess I'm gonna go
to the place where I wanna be

20:15.200 --> 20:17.867
when there's no more magic.

20:22.100 --> 20:27.867
We're done, so... here.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.200
Man, I hate this job.

20:33.200 --> 20:37.033
Every day, I see the wizard
competition tear families apart.

20:37.033 --> 20:40.700
Even I haven't seen
my own sister in years.

20:40.700 --> 20:45.500
You know what? I'm gonna
let you keep your powers.

20:48.033 --> 20:50.367
That's against the rules. I
don't know if you're allowed...

20:50.367 --> 20:52.133
Um, um, hey, look...

20:52.133 --> 20:54.734
...you're
bending the rules.

20:54.734 --> 20:59.200
I'm a rule bender. He's Johnny
Honest. Forget about him.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.567
Oh, look, if it comes up?

21:02.567 --> 21:05.000
Mr. McFly was never here.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.800
Thank you! Wow!

21:09.500 --> 21:12.667
You did it.
You guys did it!

21:12.667 --> 21:15.200
Guys, I'm sorry I got us into
this mess in the first place.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.700
Hmm, you're not
at all like Aunt Megan.

21:18.700 --> 21:22.133
But, I complain,
I make fun of you guys,

21:22.133 --> 21:24.967
and I hardly do any work.
I'm exactly like Aunt Megan.

21:24.967 --> 21:28.233
Well, a lot
of that is true.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.100
No, you apologized.
You did.

21:33.100 --> 21:36.233
That's something Aunt Megan
has never figured out how to do.

21:37.667 --> 21:40.500
Hey, what do you say
we unpack these boxes?

21:43.100 --> 21:45.200
How about we let Max do it?

21:45.200 --> 21:48.367
- [gasping]
- Don't feel like
going to Texas.

21:49.834 --> 21:53.100
Love on the rocks.
Unpack the box-es.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.400
OK. [makes beeping noises]

22:06.800 --> 22:10.500
Um, excuse me, is your
refrigerator running?

22:10.500 --> 22:12.867
Alex, I know it's you.

22:12.867 --> 22:16.000
I can see Kelbo's wand number
in my caller ID.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.233
Guys, she's on to us.

22:17.233 --> 22:19.300
You forgot to dial pound,
horse, unicorn!

22:19.300 --> 22:23.000
- What do we do?
- What we always do. Run!

22:24.500 --> 22:25.600
[grunting]
