*

00:09.443 --> 00:12.646
[overlapping chatter]

00:12.680 --> 00:14.682
- Sorry I'm late.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.651
All right, we have
a great show tonight.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.721
We don't have a great show.
We have a mediocre show tonight.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.124
We have Stephanie March
from "Law & Order: SVU."

00:23.157 --> 00:24.258
- Ooh!

00:24.292 --> 00:25.559
- We also have Gigi Gorgeous.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.728
- Who's that?
- Who is Gigi Gorgeous?

00:27.761 --> 00:30.464
She is a trans model
and makeup artist.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.500
She has millions
of YouTube subscribers,

00:32.533 --> 00:35.136
and she introduced me
to this lip gloss,

00:35.169 --> 00:36.604
which obviously looks amazing.
- It looks amazing.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.239
- It's shiny.
- Oh, she's so beautiful.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.074
- We're also gonna do
Vulgar Tweets again.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.609
- Oh, God.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.477
- That's a complete rip-off
of Jimmy's Mean Tweets.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.479
- Which Jimmy? Our Jimmy?
- No, not our Jimmy.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.381
- The other Jimmy.
- Which other Jimmy?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.350
- He's talking about Jimmy...
both: Kimmel.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.385
- Jimmy thinks it's funny,
so we're doing Vulgar Tweets.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.386
- Which Jimmy?

00:52.420 --> 00:53.821
- Jimmy, our Jimmy.

00:53.854 --> 00:58.092
- And it's funny how
he puts the little thing

00:58.126 --> 01:00.694
over the people's mouths when
they're saying the bad words.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.363
It's original.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.398
- Late night hasn't been
original since Steve Allen.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.267
- Okay, we're doing it,
and also,

01:06.300 --> 01:08.602
Jimmy's business
manager embezzled some money

01:08.636 --> 01:10.538
and took off to Mexico,
and he can't reach him.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.273
So Jimmy is drinking vodka
on the toilet

01:12.306 --> 01:13.374
up in his dressing room.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.276
Please do not disturb.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.779
So let's just go in and do
the best mediocre show we can.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.515
- Penny?
- Yeah?

01:21.549 --> 01:23.117
- What's in your neck?

01:23.151 --> 01:24.418
- What--what?

01:24.452 --> 01:26.287
- Looks like
an acupuncture needle.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.223
- Oh, that makes sense.

01:29.257 --> 01:32.360
The light in my acupuncturist's
van is a little shoddy.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.594
- Oh, I could take
it out for you.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.196
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.497
- That would be awesome,
because I'd have to wait

01:36.530 --> 01:37.731
till the next quarter moon.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.200
- Yeah, let's just
go to my office.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.534
That's where I keep
my surgical gloves.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.336
- You need surgical gloves?
- Well, no.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.606
But if something were to go
wrong, then yes.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.341
- From Studio 9B

01:47.375 --> 01:49.410
in the heart of New York City,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.879
it's "Nightcap With Jimmy."

01:51.912 --> 01:56.517
Tonight: transgender YouTube
star Gigi Gorgeous.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.619
A woman who can actually make
you gorgeous,

01:58.652 --> 02:01.222
Stephanie March.

02:01.255 --> 02:04.725
Celebrities read
mean Myspace posts.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.661
And now, the man who's
number five in the ratings,

02:07.695 --> 02:09.697
but number one in our hearts,

02:09.730 --> 02:12.200
here's Jimmy!

02:12.233 --> 02:15.836
[energetic brass music]

02:15.869 --> 02:17.338
[knocking]
- Hey.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.706
- Yep.
- It's Todd.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.441
- Yeah.
- Hi.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.876
So Jimmy wants to be set up
on a date with Gigi.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.678
- Gigi Gorgeous?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.814
We gotta make that happen.
You gotta make that happen.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.449
- Does Jimmy know
that she's...

02:28.482 --> 02:30.318
- Canadian, yeah.
He's totally fine.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.619
It's a great state.
- Okay.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.855
You are aware that
she has another name.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.690
- She in the CIA?

02:36.724 --> 02:37.958
- No, she was born "Gregory."

02:37.991 --> 02:39.493
- Oh, yeah, no, that stuff.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.828
Yeah, Jimmy knows
all about that, yeah.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.296
It's 2016.
- Okay.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.864
- You know,
he sees her on YouTube.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.433
You know, he just--
doesn't want to marry her.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.534
He just wants to hook up.
- All right.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.868
- You get that, right?
- Yeah.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.603
- You hook up.
- No, I don't hook up.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.904
- Yeah, you do.
You have to.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.706
- No, I got a gnome garden,

02:52.740 --> 02:54.442
and I volunteer
at the Humane Society.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.244
I'm full.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.845
- Okay, there's gotta be
humane guys out there, right?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.714
- No, I'm not really using
a man to fulfill me.

03:00.748 --> 03:01.849
- Okay.
- I'm just--I like--

03:01.882 --> 03:03.984
Saturday night to me
is a mug of Ovaltine

03:04.017 --> 03:06.287
and Jane Austen.
- Oh, I get it.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.921
You're into women.
[clicks tongue]

03:07.955 --> 03:09.390
- Not into anything.
Thank you.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.824
- Okay.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.860
[upbeat music]

03:12.893 --> 03:15.463
- Thanks so much for
doing this for me, Randy.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.465
I just have never had
a steady hand

03:17.498 --> 03:19.267
when it comes to needles.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.668
That's why the woman
in the wheelchair

03:20.701 --> 03:22.870
picked a fight with me
in quilters' club.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.273
- It's actually
a really simple procedure.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.974
Plus, I once got
a massage in Bali,

03:27.007 --> 03:29.277
so I'm pretty good with
Eastern medicine, okay?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.544
You got nothing
to worry about.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.679
- Why is Grady here?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.381
- I'm glad you asked.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.882
I'm filming you
for YouTube.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.350
- Why?

03:36.384 --> 03:38.552
- Extraction videos
are huge on YouTube.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.354
- Really?
- Yeah, people love watching

03:40.388 --> 03:41.889
stuff get pulled out
of other people.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.992
Blackheads,
insects from ear canals.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.295
Ingrown hairs are awesome.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.729
- Why would
anyone watch that?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.498
- Sexual gratification,
of course.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.899
- So will people--

03:51.932 --> 03:54.001
- Be fondling themselves
while they watch you?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.669
Most likely.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.306
- Why on earth
would I agree to do this?

03:58.339 --> 03:59.973
- Money.
- Money.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.544
- With the extra cash, I could
finally afford bone broth.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.012
I'm in!

04:05.045 --> 04:07.681
- All right!
Let's do it.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.917
- That's why
I'm not good in heels.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.353
Oh, my God, Ana,
we are not doing

04:12.386 --> 04:14.388
bikini waxes in
the dressing room anymore.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.823
- I am here to speak to Gigi.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.525
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no worries.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.660
I've had fans do worse.
- Oh, I'm not a fan.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.529
I just wanted to show you
my beauty line,

04:21.562 --> 04:23.431
because I was thinking
of maybe making you

04:23.464 --> 04:26.767
my spokesmodel
for Czech Mate Cosmetics.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.069
Czech, you know, like Czech?
You know, like Czech?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.971
- Oh, we get it.
We get it.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.941
- I think the trans community
needs more product identity,

04:33.974 --> 04:35.776
but I already rep a line.
I'm so sorry, boo.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.311
- Oh, she reps a line.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.447
- What the fuck
is a trans community?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.950
- She was a man,
and now she's a woman.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.718
- Ooh.
Only in America.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.520
- Well, actually
all over the world.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.522
Okay, thanks, boo.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.658
- You can still have
a look around, yeah.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.925
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.427
I'm so sorry.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.829
You know,
I don't pick the staff.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.432
- So is she transgender
too?

04:58.466 --> 05:01.335
- Oh, God, you know,
I've never asked.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.070
But I want to talk
about your interview.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.005
So you're gonna
walk out onstage,

05:05.038 --> 05:06.840
you're gonna sit down,
tell the story

05:06.874 --> 05:08.976
about how you almost died
choking on a Cheeto.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.778
- Okay, and then there's
another segment, right?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.012
- You go to the commercial,
you come back,

05:12.045 --> 05:13.547
and then you're
gonna tell the story

05:13.581 --> 05:14.948
about how you almost
incinerated your Whippet.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.850
And then you'll probably
go to dinner with him.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.352
- With Jimmy?

05:18.386 --> 05:19.687
- Yeah, he likes
to entertain the celebs

05:19.720 --> 05:20.954
after the show.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.523
So, you know,
as soon as we're done,

05:22.556 --> 05:23.757
boom, you're in his Hummer,

05:23.791 --> 05:25.893
and you're off
for some tekka maki.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.396
- What are you,
his pimp or something?

05:28.429 --> 05:29.830
- Yes, I am.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.032
- Honey, I didn't
go through all of this

05:32.065 --> 05:34.602
to be going on dates
with some aging comedian.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.637
- Okay, just--
just think about it, okay?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.572
Because it could be fun,
you know?

05:38.606 --> 05:40.608
And it could be my job.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.075
- Well, why don't
you just fuck him then?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.077
- Okay, cool.
So you'll think about it.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.646
Proms?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.715
- Okay, I'll think about it.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.887
- Ana.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.423
- I'm not taking everything.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.125
- Um, listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.993
- Me do you a favor?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.829
- I need you to convince Gigi
to go out with Jimmy tonight.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.631
- Why me?
- Well...

06:03.664 --> 06:07.801
because Gigi thinks
you're also a tran--friend.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.603
And I just need you
to convince her.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.472
- One condition.
- Mm-hmm.

06:11.505 --> 06:15.476
- You get Stephanie March
to try my beauty line products.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.978
And when she loves it,
I'm gonna become rich.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.880
I'm gonna quit
this shithole,

06:19.913 --> 06:22.450
and I'm gonna move
to Pittsburgh.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.951
- Nobody rich
lives in Pittsburgh.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.420
- I know, I'll be the
richest person in Pittsburgh.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.821
- Do we have a deal?
- We have a deal.

06:27.855 --> 06:28.822
- Okay.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.991
[energetic music]

06:31.024 --> 06:32.926
- Do not eat
those pork sliders.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.628
I know cat
when I taste cat.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.830
- Uck, I was actually
contemplating it.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.098
Thank you, girl.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.534
- Jimmy wants
to have sex with you.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.902
- Oh.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.504
Ew.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.772
I don't think I'm interested.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.440
- Okay, I get it.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.876
But I do it
a couple of times a week,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.110
and it's not so bad.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.512
- Hmm.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.846
- I just think
that you should know

06:52.880 --> 06:55.849
that Jimmy gets
50% discount at J.Crew.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.185
- Even though that sounds
very enticing, no.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.820
I don't think
I'll be dating Jimmy.

06:59.853 --> 07:00.988
- That's a good call.

07:01.021 --> 07:01.922
He's not your type.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.624
- Oh, yeah?
Who is?

07:03.657 --> 07:05.726
- I don't know,
but definitely not Jimmy.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.929
I look at Gigi, and I see,
like, a strong, confident woman.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.899
You're like a butterfly,
and Jimmy's like a dung beetle.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.635
- Wow.
I'm Gigi Gorgeous.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.837
- Randy, audio.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.940
- Nice to meet you,
Mr. Audio.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.942
- Do not eat the sliders.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.544
Rawr!

07:23.577 --> 07:25.713
- So are you gonna
fuck Jimmy or not?

07:25.746 --> 07:28.015
- No!

07:28.048 --> 07:29.449
- Smooth.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.222
[energetic brass music]

07:35.255 --> 07:37.057
- You're a very pretty girl,

07:37.090 --> 07:39.727
but what if I can make you
more pretty girl?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.929
See, I have this line
of beauty products that--

07:41.962 --> 07:44.532
- You know, I already endorse
so many products.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.099
I'm the face of them,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.035
and I have contracts with
several different companies

07:48.068 --> 07:50.070
because I have
a makeup bar called Rouge,

07:50.103 --> 07:52.039
and I feel that it would be
a conflict of interest.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.642
- Hello, it's a blow dry bar
for makeup.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.809
It's genius.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.878
- Sounds like
a wonderful spot

07:57.911 --> 07:59.580
to carry my cream.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.982
It's handmade by peasants
in the mountains.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.283
- Where are you from?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.585
- The Czech Republic.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.653
Where are you from?

08:05.686 --> 08:06.720
- East Hampton.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.788
- Is that where, like,

08:07.821 --> 08:08.889
rich people live?

08:08.922 --> 08:10.090
- Not full-time.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.525
- That's where I will live

08:11.559 --> 08:12.826
when I'm rich,
not full-time.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.762
But I really think
that you just let me try

08:14.795 --> 08:17.130
a little bit on your skin,
and then if you like,

08:17.164 --> 08:18.966
maybe you are going
to want to sell

08:18.999 --> 08:22.570
in your blow dry bar
for face store.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.037
- You know what,
give it a shot.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.606
- Okay, fantastic.
- Fine.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.874
- So I'm going
to put this on you.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.976
I try it on my whole family.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.010
- Okay.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.212
- And my family, they love it.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.047
I don't test on animals.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.749
- It's starting
to smell weird.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.718
- It's actually starting
to burn a little bit.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.219
- Oh, no, it's
the organic ingredient.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.121
It's supposed to burn, yes?
It makes it work.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.924
- Oh, ow, ow, ow.
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

08:43.957 --> 08:45.125
What is in this? Ow!

08:45.158 --> 08:46.994
- Uh, what the hell
is going on in here?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.696
- My face is burning off.
That's what's going on.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.898
- Okay, I'm going to go
and make myself a coffee.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.601
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
This is really starting to hurt.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.635
- Uh, will you do something?

08:54.668 --> 08:55.836
- Will you do something?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.170
- Somebody do something!

08:57.204 --> 08:59.707
[lively trumpet music]

08:59.740 --> 09:02.342
[sniffs]

09:02.375 --> 09:03.877
- Ah.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.278
Ahh.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.914
- Penny.
- Ahh.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.181
- Ah, what are you doing?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.783
Can you stop?
We have some news.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.919
- Penny, the video
was a huge success.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.621
We have 10,000 likes.
- 10,000 likes.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.355
- What?
- You're a star, Penny.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.591
- I directed a great video.
Now it's a hit.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.292
- I directed and created
and "story by," teleplay--

09:19.326 --> 09:20.961
- We co-directed it.
He produced it, I directed it.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.030
- Penny, the point is
we have 10,000 likes.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.665
My phone will not
stop beeping.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.700
- The point is, it's all
about content right now.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.168
Content, content, content.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.603
So what else do you have?

09:29.637 --> 09:31.038
- What else can we
pull out of you, Penny?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.940
- There is another
acupuncture needle in my thigh.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.074
- Hey!
- That's perfect.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.208
- Yes!
- You gorgeous idiot.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.209
Why didn't you tell us before?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.845
- I'm a star.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.948
- Get into hair
and makeup now.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.016
- Hey, there, hey-yo,
hi-yo, hey-yo!

09:43.050 --> 09:44.852
Ha ha, hey, hey.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.119
Damn, you are gorgeous.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.088
- Thank you. Hi.
- "Gee-gee" Gorgeous.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.356
Nice.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.791
- It's Gigi.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.059
- Cool.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.927
I'm Todd, by the way.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.063
I'm from upstairs where all
the creative magic happens.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.699
- Oh, cool.
Are you one of the writers?

09:58.732 --> 10:00.400
- Mm-hmm, yep.
- Oh.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.303
- You probably recognize me from
that ongoing segment I have.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.872
Right?
"Todd the Tool."

10:04.905 --> 10:06.173
Dress up as different tools.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.808
I was a saw.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.176
- Okay.
- A screwdriver.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.978
- It was very nice
to meet you.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.980
- Wrench.
I was also a wrench.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.114
So are you excited
for tonight?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.415
- Uh, yeah,
I'm really excited.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.884
I'm excited to be here
and be on the show.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.219
- No, no, I meant
after the show.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.121
Jimmy takes all his dates

10:21.154 --> 10:23.023
to really expensive
restaurants, so...

10:23.056 --> 10:24.892
- I'm sure Jimmy
is very nice,

10:24.925 --> 10:27.060
but, no, I will not
be going out with him,

10:27.094 --> 10:28.095
for the last time.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.296
- What?

10:29.329 --> 10:30.731
What--he's famous.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.865
He's a famous guy.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.734
- He's just not my type.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.369
- He's everyone's type
'cause he's famous.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.071
- Okay.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.873
- Wait, sorry, no one's
ever said no to Jimmy.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.842
I don't know
how to process this.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.211
He--you gotta go.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.946
- I'm gonna--
I'm actually gonna go.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.681
- No!
- Very nice meeting you.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.750
- Where you go--I don't know
how to tell Jimmy this.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.184
- Bye.
[giggles]

10:51.218 --> 10:52.886
- Oh, gosh.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.287
[energetic music]

10:54.321 --> 10:56.456
- [sighs] I can't
believe this happened.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.991
- I'm so sorry.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.326
I know I should
have said something,

10:59.359 --> 11:00.928
but quite frankly
I'm afraid of Ana.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.195
She is a monster.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.364
- Oh, my God.
What happened?

11:04.397 --> 11:07.935
- That Russian hooker's makeup
line ruined my client's face.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.837
- Yeah, she's actually
from the Czech Republic.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.238
- Shut up.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.941
Stephanie March has been
the epitome of beauty

11:13.974 --> 11:15.342
for 40 years.
- Not 40.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.811
- And then she comes
to this shit show,

11:17.845 --> 11:19.479
and now her face is ruined?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.115
- Well, we don't know
how it looks yet.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.417
The aloe vera may have
taken the swelling down.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.720
I think it's time
to take off the bandage, yeah?

11:26.754 --> 11:27.955
- Okay.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.189
- Now, listen to me
very carefully.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.357
Stuff happens all the time

11:30.390 --> 11:31.992
on our set.
- All the time.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.494
- She bruised her knee bone.
I've broken nails.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.230
Marcus always knows
how to fix everything.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.099
Girl, I'm sure it's nothing.
I'm sure--Ahhhh!

11:39.132 --> 11:40.333
- Ahhh!
- Oh, my God.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.769
- [gasps]

11:41.802 --> 11:44.171
Oh, oh.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.472
Oh!

11:45.505 --> 11:48.008
- She looks great.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.276
- Where are you going?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.878
- We have a thing.
- We have a thing.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.345
- What--come back here!
- We have a thing.

11:54.514 --> 11:58.485
[energetic brass music]

11:58.518 --> 11:59.887
- If that Ukrainian cretin

11:59.920 --> 12:01.421
is not deported
by the end of the week--

12:01.454 --> 12:02.990
- Somebody wanted
to see me?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.192
- Yeah, you and
your makeup line

12:05.225 --> 12:07.460
have disfigured
my client's face.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.296
- She has weak American skin.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.933
- It is a very good thing I have
a plastic surgeon on retainer.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.535
- You are so fired!

12:15.568 --> 12:17.337
- [chuckles] You gonna fire me?
- Yeah.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.372
- I am Jimmy's.
You can't fire me.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.274
I'm untouchable.
- You're Jimmy's?

12:21.308 --> 12:22.943
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We got it all figured out.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.912
We have an ambulance
standing by for Stephanie,

12:24.945 --> 12:27.414
and Janeane
is gonna fill in.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.083
- Janeane, I'm gonna need you
to plug Stephanie's makeup line.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.151
It's called Rouge.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.452
- Sure.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.088
- Ugh, that burned face
wore me out!

12:35.122 --> 12:38.158
I'm gonna go vape.
Excuse.

12:38.191 --> 12:42.295
- Don't you have some faces
you need to burn off?

12:42.329 --> 12:44.197
Anyway, we're so excited
to have you here, Janeane.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.099
- Thank you.
I'm happy to be here,

12:46.133 --> 12:48.168
but I'm not entirely comfortable
plugging that makeup line.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.903
I know I said I would do it,
but it's not mine,

12:49.937 --> 12:52.039
and I don't know
anything about it really.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.340
- It's okay.
We would love you

12:53.373 --> 12:55.008
to do something
that Stephanie was gonna do.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.209
She was gonna
stand up on the desk

12:56.243 --> 12:57.811
and flash her boobies,

12:57.845 --> 12:59.346
you know, like Drew Barrymore
did with Letterman.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.981
So if you just wanted to--
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.349
- Just one.
- No, no.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.317
They're both horrible.
I could not do that.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.586
Can I just do some comedy
or some stand-up or something?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.521
- Oh, pfft, comedy.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.091
Yeah, Jimmy--
Jimmy doesn't love comedy.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.125
- But it's a comedy show.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.861
- Is it?
- Intermittently.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.295
But actually--
you know, actually,

13:15.328 --> 13:16.997
a lot of people
don't think I'm funny.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.866
And I could just sort of
make conversationally--

13:18.899 --> 13:20.500
my neighbors don't
break down their boxes.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.935
I mean, this isn't a joke,

13:21.969 --> 13:23.270
but I'd like
to pretend that it is,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.005
'cause maybe
they'll see the show.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.307
Sometimes there's just
Styrofoam peanuts.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.541
And also, the recycling.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.477
Wire hangers in with
the plastic bottles.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.045
It's--it's a fool's errand.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.081
And I just think
it's poor citizenship.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.515
Plus, I don't want Zoltan
to think it's me.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.384
Zoltan is a maintenance man
in my building

13:37.417 --> 13:38.886
from Transylvania.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.487
People are from Transylvania.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.255
In fact, a lot of the
maintenance men in my building.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.892
It's a real, I guess,
who-you-know kind of thing.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.860
- Our audience, I don't think,
is really gonna relate

13:46.894 --> 13:49.329
to a building
and a maintenance man.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.298
- Not relate to people
who Airbnb illegally

13:51.331 --> 13:52.632
also on your floor?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.101
They're not gonna
relate to that?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.136
And also,
that asshole who Airbnbs,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.505
one of those Airbnbers
stole his steak knives.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.607
Then he blames
the maintenance guys.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.442
And, you know,
they're from Transylvania.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.277
I said that already.
- This isn't--

14:04.311 --> 14:06.013
- They didn't come all
the way from Transylvania

14:06.046 --> 14:07.614
in the hold of a cargo ship
covered in earth

14:07.647 --> 14:08.949
to take this kind of abuse.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.250
- All right,
you know what?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.919
I have an idea.
Why don't we play a game?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.253
Jimmy loves to play games
with girls.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.521
- Okay, what kinda game?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.123
- Have you ever seen us
play Jimmy Cricket?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.125
- Yes, yes, is that the one--
you ask him--

14:18.158 --> 14:19.459
- You ask Jimmy
sports questions,

14:19.492 --> 14:21.028
and every time he gets
something wrong,

14:21.061 --> 14:22.896
you get to smack his butt
with a paddle.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.597
- Why is it called Jiminy--

14:24.631 --> 14:26.466
- It's Jimmy Cricket,
because of the--

14:26.499 --> 14:27.634
- Right, but it's "Jiminy."

14:27.667 --> 14:29.302
- Well, there--
hence the joke.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.670
- And his name's Jimmy.
All right, I got it.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.339
Maybe I could
just talk about--

14:32.372 --> 14:34.007
I think it's rude
when people--

14:34.041 --> 14:35.575
fire trucks are loud,
I understand that.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.410
We all understand that,
but I think it's not nice

14:37.444 --> 14:39.679
when people hold their ears
when sirens go by,

14:39.712 --> 14:41.148
because somebody's
in danger.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.450
It seems arrogant,
and, you know,

14:43.483 --> 14:46.186
it's were--we're all in this
together, and I just--I just--

14:46.219 --> 14:47.487
You know what
it reminds me of,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.256
when people do this
in fire trucks?

14:49.289 --> 14:51.524
It reminds me of those who
drink their tea two-handed

14:51.558 --> 14:53.226
in an oversized mug,

14:53.260 --> 14:55.095
usually with their
sleeves pulled like this.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.563
And it's like,
"I'm so cold."

14:56.596 --> 14:58.265
- Hello, team.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.600
Okay, guys, I'm here
to check in on the stats

15:00.633 --> 15:02.002
of the second vid,

15:02.035 --> 15:03.570
and I wanted to discuss
the third vid.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.605
I think it should be a trilogy,
like in "The Lord of--"

15:05.638 --> 15:07.941
- Penny, Penny, some guy
in Cuba just posted a video.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.043
He's pulling out, like,
a three-inch piece of ear wax,

15:10.077 --> 15:11.378
17 years old.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.680
He is killing
the Internet right now.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.482
- But--
- So we're done, Pen.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.350
- What about me?

15:17.384 --> 15:20.053
- You had 15 minutes,
and now we've moved on, but--

15:20.087 --> 15:22.589
- No, the Internet loves me.
I have so much more to offer.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.291
I'm willing to have anything...
- The Internet moves fast.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.592
- Extracted from my body.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.460
Wait, guys, have I shown you
the ingrown hair

15:27.494 --> 15:28.996
on the back of my neck?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.530
I would let one of you
squeeze it out.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.598
- Penny, Penny, please--
- Shh-shh!

15:31.631 --> 15:33.133
Inside my left nostril,
if you

15:33.166 --> 15:35.002
get in there close enough...
- Penny...

15:35.035 --> 15:37.004
- I have a blackhead that's been
there for literally six months--

15:37.037 --> 15:39.039
- No, Penny! Penny, please!
- If you've got a microscop--

15:39.072 --> 15:41.141
- That is enough!

15:41.174 --> 15:42.542
You're embarrassing yourself.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.411
I'm sorry to have to be
the one to say it,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.046
but it's over.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.981
You did a great thing
here today,

15:48.015 --> 15:50.083
and you were a star,
you were.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.985
Look in my eyes
and believe that.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.521
- I was a star, I was.
- You were a star.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.990
You were the world's darling
for a few minutes,

15:57.024 --> 15:58.725
and now
you're nothing again.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.293
You tasted something sweet

16:00.327 --> 16:02.329
that we should have never
let you taste,

16:02.362 --> 16:04.497
and now nothing
will be good again.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.333
But that's reality, kid.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.735
- I knew it was too good
to be true.

16:08.768 --> 16:12.705
I'm not cut out
for this fame.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.541
- Unless...

16:14.574 --> 16:17.244
there's something else
you can do.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.212
- When I hock a loogie,

16:19.246 --> 16:22.282
it kinda looks like
Donald Trump.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.685
* *

16:25.718 --> 16:28.355
- Hey, Staci, Gigi's
not going out with Jimmy?

16:28.388 --> 16:29.722
- No, it's not happening.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.092
- Damn. Well, what about
the what's-her-face?

16:32.125 --> 16:33.693
- Well, that's just it.
Her face got burned off.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.728
She's in an ambulance
on the way to the hospital.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.530
- Is it bad?
- Remember the Nazis

16:37.564 --> 16:39.266
at the end of
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.634
- The melting faces thing?
Yeah, Jimmy's not into that.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.304
All right, uh, I'll tell
Jimmy that you failed him then.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.705
- No, no, no, don't you
tell Jimmy anything.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.507
I'm gonna fix this.

16:47.540 --> 16:54.214
*

16:54.247 --> 16:56.383
Oh, Jesus
Seriously, again?

16:56.416 --> 16:57.650
- Well, it's free.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.486
- Listen to me,
it is your fault

16:59.519 --> 17:01.388
that Stephanie March is not
going out with Jimmy tonight.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.589
So you need
to entertain him.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.424
- Oh, but it's not
my turn tonight.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.493
I entertained him
this morning.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.128
- Listen to me.
[chuckles]

17:08.161 --> 17:09.496
You don't play
with Jimmy tonight,

17:09.529 --> 17:11.464
I'm gonna tell
every publicist in town

17:11.498 --> 17:14.334
that you get your makeup base
from Chernobyl.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.204
- Okay, fine,
I'll do it.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.371
- Good!

17:18.405 --> 17:21.574
- You are ruthless,
like a mobster.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.243
Makes me homesick.

17:23.276 --> 17:27.080
- Excuse me, how hard
am I allowed to hit Jimmy?

17:27.114 --> 17:28.681
- Well, I usually hit him
as hard as I can

17:28.715 --> 17:30.317
until he says his safe word.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.185
- What's his safe word?
- Stop.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.321
- Stop?
- Much like this show,

17:34.354 --> 17:36.256
Jimmy doesn't put a lot
of effort into it.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.858
- Understood.
I'll see you out there.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.693
- Okay.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.629
She's gonna kill him.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.630
*

17:43.663 --> 17:45.765
[cheers and applause]

17:45.798 --> 17:47.867
- Hey, Gigi, can I grab
that mic from you real quick?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.402
- Yeah, sure.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.870
- You were really great
on the show tonight.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.539
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Audio.
- Did you have fun?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.807
Did you have fun?
- Yeah, it was fun.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.676
- Sorry.
Caught in your hair.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.178
You have really nice hair.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.612
Anybody ever tell you that?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.148
- [chuckles]
Yeah, thank you.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.382
- Sorry, I got it
in your eye.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.683
- No worries.
I like your hair too.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.152
It's cute, the curls.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.519
- Thanks.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.455
So you, uh,
you turned Jimmy down, right?

18:08.488 --> 18:10.190
- Yes.
- Yeah.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.658
Well, I'm free tonight,

18:11.691 --> 18:14.827
if you maybe wanted
to get food or something.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.529
- Yeah, let's do it.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.731
- Uh, I didn't think
you'd say that, um...

18:18.765 --> 18:20.667
- You need to have
more confidence.

18:20.700 --> 18:25.138
- Oh, I'm Jewish,
so, uh, it's not natural.

18:25.172 --> 18:29.409
But yeah, so, um, I know,
like, a good Indian place.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.344
- Oh, you know what,
if I have Indian food,

18:31.378 --> 18:33.446
I'll be shitting all night,
so probably not.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.615
- Yeah, let's not do that.
Chinese?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.317
- Um, nah.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.352
- No, okay.
Uh, sushi?

18:39.386 --> 18:40.853
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.555
- Let's do it.
- Cool.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.891
I'm just a little short
on cash at the moment.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.460
- Typical man.
Let's go.
