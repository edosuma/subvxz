00:04.583 --> 00:07.250
Well from July 2013 to last June

00:07.250 --> 00:11.208
54 men, women, and children
had their lives cut short

00:11.208 --> 00:12.291
because of domestic violence.

00:12.291 --> 00:14.333
...spiraled out of control.

00:14.375 --> 00:17.291
Sadly, we know the tragic way
that Sunday turned out

00:17.291 --> 00:19.708
when a mother and her
2-year-old were killed.

00:19.708 --> 00:22.125
Some question why police
didn't arrest him,

00:22.125 --> 00:26.333
but domestic experts tell Lena Tillett
the law can be difficult to navigate.

00:26.708 --> 00:30.166
...daughter never told her about
violence in her relationship.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.250
But she said she did talk to others.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.750
Now the mother says she
understands as a friend

00:34.750 --> 00:36.708
you may not want to break a confidence,

00:36.708 --> 00:40.625
but she says it could be your first
and possibly your only chance

00:40.625 --> 00:42.291
to save someone's life.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.541
I just wanted to let you know I'm sorry.

00:44.666 --> 00:47.041
I mean I knew it was bad.

00:47.791 --> 00:50.708
I just didn't know something like
this would happen.

00:52.458 --> 00:55.375
I knew what your brother was doing to my daughter.

00:55.791 --> 00:58.958
So I always knew something like
this would happen.

00:59.416 --> 01:01.125
You could've done anything!

01:01.291 --> 01:02.291
But you didn't.

01:02.291 --> 01:06.416
So this is your fault
just as much as it's his.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.500
I'm sorry.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.791
Just leave.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.375
(mouse clicks)

01:15.041 --> 01:16.708
Chris: Baby, say hey!
Nailah: To who?

01:16.791 --> 01:17.791
Social Live.

01:17.791 --> 01:19.791
Heeey, Social Live!

01:19.791 --> 01:21.375
Why you gotta get so hood, though?

01:21.875 --> 01:24.333
Chris: Such an attention bully.
Nailah: I am not!

01:24.916 --> 01:26.666
She's an attention bully, folks.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.750
(Nailah laughs)

01:31.875 --> 01:33.833
(mouse clicks)

01:37.333 --> 01:38.333
What's up, y'all?

01:39.125 --> 01:39.958
So...

01:39.958 --> 01:43.750
I just woke up to the most
beautiful image I've ever seen,

01:47.208 --> 01:49.625
just a queen resting.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.375
Perfection.

(small crowd chatter)

02:12.583 --> 02:13.583
Hey.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.291
Hey! Hey... Wait.

02:17.041 --> 02:18.041
Is this thing on?

02:18.041 --> 02:20.125
Fuck it. Alright.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.541
Hey!

02:21.541 --> 02:23.666
Buddy, you joined the club. Alright?

02:23.666 --> 02:27.750
You're in it alright, but I still got
three years on you, Grasshopper.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.750
But... you know...

02:30.166 --> 02:31.166
Shit. Ah.

02:31.166 --> 02:33.375
Ok, but I still love you guys. I love you.

02:33.375 --> 02:36.208
And we're going to do great things

02:36.208 --> 02:38.875
now that school is out, alright?

02:38.875 --> 02:41.333
Yeah!
(drunken laugh)

02:42.583 --> 02:43.583
Grasshopper!

02:43.875 --> 02:45.500
You remember that?

02:46.791 --> 02:48.916
Look! It's the happy couple. Alright?

02:48.916 --> 02:50.625
Hey. Smile, you two.

02:50.625 --> 02:54.291
Smile like you love each other or some...
shit like that.

02:54.416 --> 02:57.666
Ok!
There you go. There you go.

02:57.666 --> 03:01.000
Alright! Oh. Uh. Ooooh

03:01.000 --> 03:03.125
Yeah, there're babies in their future.

03:09.625 --> 03:15.083
(crowd applause)

03:15.083 --> 03:18.166
Nailah: Alright Class of 2002!

03:18.166 --> 03:20.416
If you can hear me, clap one time.
(crowd claps once)

03:20.416 --> 03:23.000
If you can hear me, clap two times.
(crowd claps twice)

03:23.000 --> 03:25.333
If you can hear me, clap three times!
(crowd claps three times)

03:25.333 --> 03:26.333
Good.

03:28.416 --> 03:34.291
They say the average person
has ten seconds between blinks.

03:35.083 --> 03:38.416
And so much can happen within that time.

03:39.458 --> 03:44.250
We graduated over a decade ago,
and that's exactly what it feels like...

03:44.458 --> 03:45.916
a blink.

03:46.458 --> 03:52.500
In ten seconds you could change your mind,
which would change your life.

03:52.500 --> 03:57.333
So if these last ten years hasn't been
what you want them to be,

03:57.333 --> 04:00.541
don't let the next ten be the same.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.500
It's only a blink away.

04:04.708 --> 04:05.708
Thank you.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.166
(crowd applause)

04:08.166 --> 04:11.000
(crowd applause)
(Hip-Hop music plays)

04:14.125 --> 04:16.916
(Music continues)

04:25.958 --> 04:26.958
So Chris...

04:27.666 --> 04:29.833
how did you and Nailah meet?

04:30.291 --> 04:31.291
Oh!

04:31.625 --> 04:33.291
At the grocery store, acutally.

04:33.291 --> 04:36.750
My brother and I were in the store,
and she just...

04:36.750 --> 04:38.875
kind of came out of nowhere.

04:38.875 --> 04:40.291
Yellow sun dress.

04:40.291 --> 04:42.333
Hair pulled in a ponytail.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.833
Blue earrings to match her shoes.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.958
It was like a dream.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.083
I mean, you know
every man is gonna try, but...

04:50.375 --> 04:53.916
I thought it was some kind of joke when
she actually gave me the time of day.

04:54.958 --> 04:55.958
I got lucky.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.833
Let me ask you a question.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.291
Why don't you guys where rings?

05:02.708 --> 05:06.375
Oh! Well! See, a ring they tend to put
value on your love.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.250
Our love is priceless.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.250
Can't put a price on priceless.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.166
Aaaaaaaw!

05:15.416 --> 05:17.291
(high heel footsteps approaching)

05:21.250 --> 05:22.958
Oh! Good job, babe.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.500
Thank you.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.750
Hey girl, good job!

05:26.750 --> 05:28.500
Nice to see you. You did so-

05:28.500 --> 05:29.500
(Nailah gasps)

05:29.500 --> 05:30.500
Chris: Ah!

05:30.500 --> 05:31.500
Baby, I'm sorry!

05:31.500 --> 05:32.916
Chris: Nah nah.
Nailah: I'm so clumsy.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.458
Nailah: Let me get some paper towels.
Chris: Nah nah nah. It's ok, babe. I got it.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.333
I'm sorry.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.791
Come on. You know a party don't start
till someone's pants get wet.

05:38.791 --> 05:41.208
I gotta go to the restroom anyway.
I'll clean it up in there.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.875
Are you sure?
I could just grab some more pa-

05:42.875 --> 05:43.875
Chris: Babe!

05:44.208 --> 05:45.208
Ok.

05:45.583 --> 05:46.583
Excuse me, ladies.

05:49.708 --> 05:50.708
Samantha: Mmm!

05:50.708 --> 05:52.333
Isn't he a keeper?

05:52.500 --> 05:53.500
What?

05:53.916 --> 05:55.291
Nothing. It's just that...

05:55.291 --> 05:57.541
I see why we don't see you
that much anymore.

05:57.541 --> 06:00.500
I mean, I would ask you how's married
life treating you but...

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
It's great!

06:02.500 --> 06:04.958
Having someone love you unconditionally?

06:05.541 --> 06:06.541
It's amazing.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.458
Everyone can't have that fairy tale.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.333
Tonight was really what we needed.

06:18.416 --> 06:21.625
With all your cases and all my grading...

06:21.625 --> 06:23.833
it was really good to get out the house.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.375
I knew Samantha would adore you.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.416
She likes everybody.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.041
Do you think she was too tipsy to drive?

06:39.458 --> 06:41.375
(window crack)

06:41.375 --> 06:42.833
Next time watch what the hell you doing!

06:49.875 --> 06:55.083
Nailah: Ok, class. It's almost time
for your summer vacation.

06:55.083 --> 06:58.541
But what do we have to keep on doing?

06:58.541 --> 06:59.375
Improving!

06:59.375 --> 07:00.583
Nailah: Improving, yes!

07:00.583 --> 07:03.583
And what three things
are we working on this summer?

07:04.125 --> 07:05.125
Reading!

07:05.791 --> 07:06.791
Writing.

07:07.250 --> 07:07.750
Spelling.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.250
Nailah: Yes. Reading, writing,
and spelling.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.791
I want you all to come back smarter
and better next year.

07:13.791 --> 07:14.250
Ok?

07:14.250 --> 07:15.625
Class: Ok!

07:15.791 --> 07:16.791
(knocks on door)

07:16.833 --> 07:18.291
Yes?

07:19.000 --> 07:19.833
Mrs. Belle?

07:19.833 --> 07:21.875
They said you have a call
in the front office.

07:21.875 --> 07:22.875
Ok. Thank you.

07:25.583 --> 07:26.583
Ok, class.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.708
You can talk, but don't leave your seat.

07:30.791 --> 07:32.791
No one leaves this classroom, ok?

07:32.791 --> 07:33.791
Student: Ok.

07:40.875 --> 07:41.875
Hello.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.625
Hey, why aren't you answering your phone?

07:43.875 --> 07:44.875
Babe!

07:44.875 --> 07:47.041
You know I can't have my cell phone
on in the classroom.

07:47.041 --> 07:50.208
Hey, them little bad ass kids ain't giving
you too much trouble out there, are they?

07:50.208 --> 07:52.291
Don't talk about my babies!

07:52.291 --> 07:54.333
They just need more support than others.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.541
They need tender love and care

07:56.541 --> 07:58.833
And you the perfect person for it, babe.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.583
Hey, what time you get off?

08:00.583 --> 08:01.333
Late.

08:01.333 --> 08:02.416
But not too late.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.125
We have end of the year meetings.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.958
Yeah, cause Dereck's coming in today
and I want the house and everything

08:06.958 --> 08:08.208
to be in order when he gets there.

08:09.291 --> 08:10.291
Ok...

08:10.833 --> 08:12.666
When did you know he was coming?

08:12.666 --> 08:15.000
I told you he was coming.
He just called me today.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.291
Oh! Ok.

08:16.291 --> 08:17.708
Is that a problem?

08:17.708 --> 08:18.708
No! No!

08:18.708 --> 08:20.333
I can get it done.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.958
I just didn't know he was staying with us.

08:21.958 --> 08:22.958
We hadn't...

08:22.958 --> 08:23.958
discussed it.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.500
Yeah, he needs something stable
so he can get on his feet.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.833
Plus, I haven't seen him since
he got locked up.

08:28.875 --> 08:29.875
Yeah, I know.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.041
So is that ok with you?

08:32.041 --> 08:33.916
Yeah! He's family, you know.

08:33.916 --> 08:35.750
Better with us than anybody.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.291
See, that's why I love you, babe.

08:37.332 --> 08:38.291
Pick him up at nine.

08:38.291 --> 08:39.707
Wait! I have to pick him up?

08:39.707 --> 08:41.625
Yeah, I can't. I'll still be working.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.207
Nailah: But I have to clean this classroom

08:43.207 --> 08:45.166
and I have end of the year reports due!

08:45.166 --> 08:46.500
Chris: Ah babe, you got it.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
Hey, I gotta go though.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.250
I'll talk to you later.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.250
Love you.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.250
(sighs)

08:52.416 --> 08:53.416
Guess I got it.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.166
(hangs up phone)

09:01.708 --> 09:02.875
Alright, so what we looking like?

09:02.875 --> 09:04.541
Oh, pretty good actually.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.166
Your presentation was excellent.

09:07.166 --> 09:09.375
The whole community aspect,
that was great, but...

09:09.541 --> 09:11.875
We need to make them see how

09:11.875 --> 09:15.125
getting another property would
be more profitable.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.500
What, it being the only good school
in the community isn't good enough?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.958
Plus, they already know the profit
will be at least equal.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.458
They're not moved by equal, though.

09:22.458 --> 09:25.166
Buying a vacant property would be.

09:25.166 --> 09:29.166
But it'd also be a slight
inconvenience that...

09:29.166 --> 09:31.250
that they wouldn't see as necessary.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.250
Unless...

09:32.666 --> 09:33.666
it's worth it.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.625
So, I gotta crunch some more numbers.

09:35.625 --> 09:36.625
(Nick scoffs)

09:36.833 --> 09:37.833
Done!

09:38.750 --> 09:40.041
See, that's why I love you.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.000
Oh I know. I know.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.208
Oh! Hey hey!

09:44.708 --> 09:47.916
In other news, you're gonna handle
that situation for me, right?

09:47.916 --> 09:48.916
Come on, man. I got you.

09:49.250 --> 09:49.875
You sure?

09:49.875 --> 09:50.500
Yeah!

09:50.500 --> 09:51.250
Most definitely.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.250
Alright. You the one!

09:52.250 --> 09:54.708
Hey! I know.
Now tell Sarah I said hello.

09:56.541 --> 09:58.375
Chris: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going today?

09:58.375 --> 09:59.375
Business man: Pleasure, sir.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.458
(Slow tempo Hip-Hop music fades in)

10:03.458 --> 10:49.916
(music plays)

10:50.000 --> 11:02.458
(Music begins to slowly fade)

11:05.166 --> 11:11.250
(phone buzzes)

11:15.166 --> 11:16.166
Hello.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.416
Dereck: Hello, Nailah, is that you?

11:19.416 --> 11:21.333
Yeah. Who's this?

11:21.333 --> 11:22.333
Dereck: This Dereck.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.333
Hey!

11:23.916 --> 11:25.666
Did you make your bus?

11:25.666 --> 11:26.666
Dereck: No, I'm here.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.250
Where?

11:28.250 --> 11:29.250
Dereck: I'm in Houston.

11:29.541 --> 11:30.541
What!?

11:30.875 --> 11:32.791
I thought you got in at nine.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.625
(gasps) Oh my God!

11:37.166 --> 11:39.750
(music plays)

12:02.875 --> 12:04.625
Dereck: Hey.
What's going on?

12:04.625 --> 12:05.625
Nailah: I am so sorry!

12:05.625 --> 12:07.833
I was getting the house together and working...

12:07.833 --> 12:09.750
and I just accidentally fell asleep.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.750
Oh nah! You know

12:10.750 --> 12:13.000
by the time you get here and get your
bags from under the thing

12:13.000 --> 12:15.083
time just be done flew by so we cool.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.750
Nailah: Oh good! It worked out.

12:16.750 --> 12:17.750
Nailah: So!

12:17.750 --> 12:19.041
How are you?

12:19.041 --> 12:20.041
I'm good.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.166
I'm good.

12:22.291 --> 12:23.291
Nailah: Just good?

12:23.875 --> 12:25.500
Any plans while you're here?

12:25.500 --> 12:29.750
Dereck: Yeah! I plan on
working until my probation is up.

12:29.875 --> 12:30.791
Dereck: Pretty much.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.916
How long is that?

12:31.916 --> 12:33.500
Like six to nine months.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.958
Nailah: Oh, you'll get through it.

12:34.958 --> 12:37.208
Nailah: Well you can stay with us
for as long as you like.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.208
Dereck: Well thank you.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.208
Nailah: No rush.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.208
So how's Chris?

12:43.750 --> 12:44.750
He's doing good.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.041
Everything is good.

12:47.041 --> 12:47.833
He's...

12:47.833 --> 12:49.875
doing really well at work.

12:50.375 --> 12:53.791
He's overseeing a lot of projects
and accounts.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
He's doing really good.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.250
Well, what about y'all?

12:57.750 --> 12:58.750
Everything is good.

12:59.916 --> 13:00.916
Dereck: Ok.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.916
(door opens)

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
Chris: There he go!

13:09.750 --> 13:11.250
Chris: What's up, baby?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.166
Chris: Hey! Come here, man.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.416
Hold on, I can't even call you that
no more.

13:15.416 --> 13:18.291
You grew up on me.
Look at you, all big and everything!

13:18.458 --> 13:19.833
Man, it's ben what, three years?

13:19.958 --> 13:21.375
Yeah, it's been about three.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.541
Chris: Dang!

13:22.541 --> 13:24.208
Man, I missed you, bruh!

13:24.208 --> 13:25.625
What you got going on back here?

13:25.625 --> 13:27.125
Chris: Hair all long!
Dereck: Bro!

13:27.250 --> 13:28.041
Dereck: Chill out.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.333
Hey, give me a hug, man.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.625
Chris: Come on.
Dereck: I'm good, bro.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.000
Chris: Good to see you, man!

13:33.000 --> 13:35.208
Hey, what took you so long? What Happened?
Your bus got delayed?

13:35.416 --> 13:36.416
Oh nah!

13:36.416 --> 13:37.750
That would be my fault.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.625
I accidentally fell asleep while working.

13:40.541 --> 13:43.291
I told you nine o'clock. Why would you
let yourself fall asleep?

13:43.375 --> 13:44.458
Baby, it wasn't on purpose.

13:44.458 --> 13:45.625
Chris: You didn't answer my question.
Dereck: Whoa!

13:45.625 --> 13:47.291
Bro, chill. It was an accident.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.583
I'm cool!

13:48.583 --> 13:51.000
The house look amazing! Can I get a tour?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.083
Dereck: Where I'm sleeping?
Chris: For sure.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.000
For sure, come on.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Dereck: Alright.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.708
Dereck: 'Preciate it, Nailah.

13:56.791 --> 14:00.416
(Ominous sound)

14:11.083 --> 14:13.458
Dereck's gone to bed already?

14:13.458 --> 14:15.916
Chris: Yeah. He was tired.

14:17.125 --> 14:25.333
(music plays)

14:37.125 --> 14:38.125
Chris!

14:38.833 --> 14:39.833
Wait a minute! I'm s-

14:44.041 --> 14:47.125
(beating sounds)

14:47.125 --> 14:48.125
(Nailah cries in pain)

14:48.125 --> 14:50.000
Chris: How fucking sorry are you when
you can't even handle

14:50.000 --> 14:51.791
one simple task I ask you to do?

14:51.875 --> 14:53.625
Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!

14:53.625 --> 14:54.500
Easy!

14:54.500 --> 14:55.500
Fucking easy!

14:57.083 --> 14:58.083
(slaps)

14:58.333 --> 14:59.333
(egg crack)

14:59.416 --> 15:01.416
(egg sizzle)

15:09.333 --> 15:10.333
Dereck: Yo.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.375
Morning! Morning.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.083
Why you up so early?

15:14.708 --> 15:15.708
Programmed that way.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Ah okay.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.416
How'd you sleep?

15:18.916 --> 15:20.625
Pretty good. Pretty good.

15:20.791 --> 15:21.791
Bro!

15:22.541 --> 15:23.500
You still do this shit?

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
You still do this shit?
(carton sounds near empty)

15:25.500 --> 15:27.000
It's called a trash can.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.250
I figured somebody'd get it for me.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.625
So what's your schedule?

15:33.916 --> 15:36.791
Oh, nothing heavy. I'm a probably go
put in some applications

15:36.791 --> 15:38.541
and see if somebody pick me up.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.708
You know, I did some fighting
in the joint so...

15:41.708 --> 15:44.583
I was pretty good so, I'm a see if-
check out some gyms or something.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.875
Alright, well...

15:46.875 --> 15:48.208
you do your thing, man.

15:48.416 --> 15:49.416
But no rush.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.958
You're good here. You hear me?

15:52.750 --> 15:53.750
Hey, Nailah up?

15:53.750 --> 15:54.750
Chris: Nah, not yet.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.541
She called in late.
Had a little headache or something.

15:57.666 --> 15:58.666
What time you get off?

15:58.833 --> 15:59.833
Depends.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.791
But hey, if you need me, you call me.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.583
I'm not that busy, alright?

16:05.625 --> 16:06.625
Dereck: Yep.

16:16.583 --> 16:19.458
(Soft somber music)

16:19.458 --> 16:23.458
(Nailah whimpers in pain)

16:31.583 --> 16:34.666
(gasps in pain)

16:42.625 --> 16:43.375
(knocks on door)

16:43.375 --> 16:44.375
Nailah, you up?

16:44.875 --> 16:46.416
Chris said you was under the weather.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.083
Yeah!

16:48.333 --> 16:49.333
I'm fine.

16:49.791 --> 16:50.791
Dereck: You dressed?

16:51.583 --> 16:52.583
No, not yet.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.958
I just wanted to know if I could drop you
off and use your car today for a while.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.000
Yeah, that's fine.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.500
I'll be ready in a minute.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
Dereck: Alright.

17:07.875 --> 17:08.833
(whimpers in pain)

17:08.833 --> 17:14.833
(Soft somber music)

17:36.041 --> 17:37.041
(door opens)

17:37.750 --> 17:38.750
(knocks)

17:39.625 --> 17:40.625
Nailah: Hello, there.

17:41.041 --> 17:42.333
Principal: They're gone. They're gone!

17:42.333 --> 17:44.166
We got three months away from them.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.458
Thank God!

17:45.458 --> 17:46.458
(Nailah laughs)
Right!

17:47.833 --> 17:48.833
I like your room.

17:49.625 --> 17:50.125
Look!

17:50.125 --> 17:51.958
Before you leave today, stop by my office would you?

17:52.083 --> 17:53.083
Okay, I will.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.041
Great.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.416
Principal: Oh. Ivy?

17:56.083 --> 17:57.083
From your husband?

17:57.083 --> 18:00.666
Nailah: Uh, yeah. He always buys sweet surprises like that.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.041
Principal: They're beautiful.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.833
Alright. I see I need pointers.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.375
Nailah: How about...

18:06.375 --> 18:07.708
Happy wife?

18:07.708 --> 18:08.875
Happy life.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.208
I've heard that before.

18:10.208 --> 18:10.750
(clap)

18:10.750 --> 18:11.500
See you in a minute.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.000
I will be there.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.458
(Principal and Paula talking)

18:17.875 --> 18:18.791
Oh! I'm sorry.

18:18.791 --> 18:20.041
I'll come back later.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.750
Oh no. Mrs. Belle, please come in.

18:21.750 --> 18:22.750
This is Ms. Jordan.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.083
She's the new teacher-student counselor.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.083
Nailah: Oh!

18:25.250 --> 18:26.583
I'm... nice to meet you.

18:26.708 --> 18:27.708
You too.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.458
I've heard so much about you.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.125
Well, let's hope I don't make a liar
out of anyone.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.125
(nervous laugh)

18:33.916 --> 18:37.541
Look! I'm gonna get out of you guys' way.
I have so much to do.

18:37.666 --> 18:39.416
And you guys enjoy your evening.

18:39.416 --> 18:40.916
And I'll see you this Summer.

18:41.458 --> 18:42.958
You too...

18:45.083 --> 18:46.083
So...

18:46.208 --> 18:47.875
Teacher-student counselor?

18:49.208 --> 18:51.708
Yeah, the school board says it's
manditory with all the new

18:51.708 --> 18:54.208
teacher-student relationships
popping up in the news.

18:54.458 --> 18:57.291
So they want to make sure we don't have
any unstable teachers teaching our kids.

18:57.291 --> 18:59.958
So now we got somebody to watch us
to make sure we're sane.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.208
And she's going to start with you.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.208
What!?

19:05.041 --> 19:06.041
Why me?

19:06.333 --> 19:08.250
Because, in my book...

19:08.375 --> 19:09.750
you're our best teacher.

19:10.291 --> 19:12.083
I wanna start in a safe place.

19:12.583 --> 19:15.208
And plus, you'll be here a couple of days
throughout the week during the Summer

19:15.208 --> 19:16.208
so it fits.

19:16.708 --> 19:18.416
I don't need the first report back
to be negative.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.416
I don't know about that.

19:20.916 --> 19:21.916
It's simple.

19:22.416 --> 19:24.875
You'll meet with a couple of days
out the week for evaluation

19:24.875 --> 19:26.125
and she'll come by your house for a visit.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.125
My house!?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.916
My brother-in-law is there.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.166
This just isn't good timing.

19:31.875 --> 19:32.500
(exhales)

19:32.500 --> 19:35.000
I know and I'm sorry to throw you
under the bus like this.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.083
But I had to start somewhere.

19:37.458 --> 19:38.833
Principal: She'll give us evaluation...

19:39.333 --> 19:40.291
Principal: Thumbs up.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.291
Principal: You're good!

19:41.625 --> 19:43.125
Principal: Nailah... believe me.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.416
You have nothing to worry about.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.250
(basketball sounds)

20:05.083 --> 20:05.875
Dereck: Yeah, man.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.291
This a nice neighborhood

20:07.291 --> 20:09.125
but that leaving the door open shit?

20:09.375 --> 20:10.375
I don't know how y'all do that.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.833
Chris: Ah man, it's cool.
Everybody know each other around here.

20:12.833 --> 20:13.625
Chris: But!

20:13.625 --> 20:16.250
I keep a nine at the top of the closet,
just in case, ready to go.

20:19.291 --> 20:20.291
Chris: Damn!

20:21.166 --> 20:22.166
Good game.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.125
Alright, I'm out!

20:23.125 --> 20:24.125
That's it?

20:25.125 --> 20:27.208
Dereck: Yeah, I gotta go get this
run in before training today.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.541
Chris: Ah man, well can you wait for training?

20:29.875 --> 20:32.000
Can't spend the day with your big brother?
Catch up with me!

20:32.125 --> 20:33.791
Let's go get some smoothies
or something, man.

20:34.916 --> 20:36.083
Alright, let's do it.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.125
Chris: Bet!

20:37.208 --> 20:45.250
(music plays)

20:45.250 --> 20:48.083
Bro, you don't remember when you and Nick
got locked in that store?

20:48.166 --> 20:49.708
Think somebody was like robbing it or something.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.125
Man, how can I forget!?

20:51.125 --> 20:53.541
Y'all had mom and dad scared sick!

20:53.791 --> 20:54.791
Yeah, I bet.

20:55.916 --> 20:57.166
Mom and dad...

20:57.916 --> 20:58.583
Exactly.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.750
You think you could be with
Nailah that long?

21:01.750 --> 21:02.541
Oh yeah!

21:02.541 --> 21:03.541
Definitely.

21:04.166 --> 21:07.458
To be honest, Nailah is one of the best if
not the best thing to ever happen to me.

21:08.541 --> 21:11.625
I really don't know where I'd be without
her love and understanding.

21:12.916 --> 21:14.375
I can't see it!

21:14.375 --> 21:15.375
What's that?

21:16.375 --> 21:18.750
Being with the same woman
for the rest of my life?

21:19.333 --> 21:20.333
Chris: Oh yeah?

21:20.583 --> 21:22.625
Hey, speaking of which,
you ain't dating nobody?

21:22.791 --> 21:23.791
Yeah! Jada.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.125
Jada from around the corner?

21:25.125 --> 21:25.583
Yeah!

21:25.583 --> 21:26.583
Yeah yeah.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.500
She wrote me when I was locked up,
so we kicking it now.

21:28.833 --> 21:30.166
Chris: Nice! Nice.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
But...

21:32.583 --> 21:33.583
Don't get it twisted.

21:34.416 --> 21:35.291
Yeah, marriage?

21:35.291 --> 21:37.250
That's something that y'all work at everyday.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.250
Both of you.

21:38.666 --> 21:40.375
You gotta be committed to
take this journey,

21:40.375 --> 21:42.250
but you gotta be man enough
to make this journey.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.416
Chris: She gotta be able to understand
that you not perfect.

21:45.958 --> 21:48.875
But she also gotta be willing to
accept where you fall short.

21:49.416 --> 21:50.958
I appreciate y'all marriage.

21:50.958 --> 21:53.583
I'm just happy to see something else
better than mom and pop's.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.208
Wasn't nothing wrong with mom
and pop's marriage!

21:56.416 --> 21:57.416
What!?

21:57.416 --> 21:57.958
Yeah!

21:57.958 --> 21:59.458
I structure my marriage after theirs.

21:59.833 --> 22:00.375
I mean...

22:00.375 --> 22:02.208
we different people.
It's a different time.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.500
But the basics of their marriage
was strong.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.583
I got a lot to learn about marriage then.

22:08.583 --> 22:09.583
(phone dings)

22:09.583 --> 22:11.000
Yeah, apparently so.

22:11.208 --> 22:12.000
Aye...

22:12.000 --> 22:13.166
Look! I gotta run...

22:13.916 --> 22:15.333
Look. I want to um...

22:15.750 --> 22:16.791
I wanna finish this up later.

22:16.791 --> 22:18.500
I wanna hear more about
this fighting, dude.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.375
What about it?

22:19.375 --> 22:20.375
You nice?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.750
I mean, I was good locked up.

22:22.750 --> 22:25.583
But out here, professionally,
it's a different game.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.708
Man, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance
to come in there and see you, bro.

22:30.250 --> 22:31.958
But after Pops died, things got...

22:32.083 --> 22:32.958
different.

22:32.958 --> 22:33.958
You know?

22:34.125 --> 22:36.625
Yeah, well nobody wanna come
see they people locked up.

22:36.958 --> 22:37.958
So it's cool.

22:38.625 --> 22:39.500
So we good?

22:39.500 --> 22:40.375
Dereck: We good.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.083
(Gentle music)

22:44.916 --> 22:45.916
Nailah: Well, hello.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Chris: Welcome home!

22:48.666 --> 22:49.958
What are you up to?

22:50.208 --> 22:51.666
Chris: Why I gotta be up to something?

22:51.666 --> 22:53.500
Well let's see, you cooked...

22:53.500 --> 22:55.208
and you normally don't.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.625
And you have candles.

23:02.833 --> 23:05.375
And I see you have my favorite wine.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.375
(Chris clears throat)

23:06.833 --> 23:07.750
Well...

23:07.750 --> 23:08.750
No.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.291
I'm not up to anything.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.250
I just know how hard you been
working lately, and...

23:13.708 --> 23:15.541
I was talking to me brother the other day

23:15.541 --> 23:16.666
coaching him on women

23:16.666 --> 23:20.208
and I realized a couple of things
that I been falling off on.

23:20.875 --> 23:23.208
I know we been at each other's
throats lately.

23:23.208 --> 23:26.791
Lashing out at each other when
we're not even the problem.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.375
Is that what it is?

23:30.333 --> 23:31.333
W-w-what do you mean?

23:32.041 --> 23:33.666
Is that why you um...

23:35.916 --> 23:38.166
get mad and do the things you do?

23:38.916 --> 23:42.416
I know I piss you off and
mess things up sometimes.

23:42.666 --> 23:44.083
But when I don't...

23:44.208 --> 23:47.000
Is it because of other things
that aren't going right?

23:47.583 --> 23:49.791
I mean, if so, I can understand that.

23:50.708 --> 23:51.708
I...

23:51.708 --> 23:52.458
just don't understa-

23:52.458 --> 23:53.750
Hey, know this.

23:54.291 --> 23:56.333
Everything that I do is for you.

23:56.375 --> 23:57.375
And us.

23:57.791 --> 23:58.791
I love you.

23:58.791 --> 24:01.458
And when I put my hands on you,
it's not like that.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.416
It's hard to explain but

24:03.416 --> 24:05.041
I do it because I love you.

24:05.416 --> 24:07.208
Because I know you won't learn
unless I do.

24:07.416 --> 24:08.416
You won't grow.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.250
I don't know no other way.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.625
That's how my dad disciplined me,
but he didn't do Dereck like that.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.041
And look what happened?

24:16.625 --> 24:18.458
So it's like I'm doing it for you.

24:18.958 --> 24:19.958
You understand?

24:21.750 --> 24:23.041
Do you understand?

24:26.666 --> 24:27.666
Yes.

24:27.958 --> 24:28.958
You sure?

24:30.916 --> 24:31.916
Yes.

24:33.666 --> 24:34.666
See?

24:34.916 --> 24:37.500
Nobody will ever understand us
and our love.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.666
Because they never felt love
like this before.

24:41.833 --> 24:42.708
Beu hey...

24:42.708 --> 24:43.708
I promise you.

24:44.666 --> 24:46.750
I will never stop loving you.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.250
Okay?

24:49.375 --> 24:50.375
Okay.

24:51.541 --> 24:52.541
So uh...

24:53.666 --> 24:55.541
How about we skip dinner
and go to dessert?

24:55.958 --> 24:56.958
(Nailah laughs)

24:56.958 --> 25:00.166
(Romantic music)

27:12.541 --> 27:13.500
Chris: Yeah.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.416
Chris: Okay yeah! She's in the house.

27:15.458 --> 27:16.916
I just stepped out.

27:17.125 --> 27:17.958
(Dereck hits the wooden fence)

27:17.958 --> 27:18.958
Chris: Hold on.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.125
Chris: Dereck!?

27:23.541 --> 27:24.541
Chris: Alright.

27:24.666 --> 27:25.666
So did you get the flowers?

27:27.375 --> 27:29.916
Okay. Good. Good.
Glad those worked for you.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.916
So you gonna be free that day, right?

27:33.291 --> 27:34.291
Alright.

27:34.458 --> 27:36.833
Okay, so it's at the Howard Downtown.

27:36.833 --> 27:39.500
Just go in and grab your key
from the front desk.

27:40.291 --> 27:41.666
Alright. See you in a few.

27:45.208 --> 27:51.791
(boxing training sounds)
(Hip-Hop music)

27:56.250 --> 27:57.250
Coach: Let me hear it!

27:58.291 --> 28:01.666
No opportunity is given here
if you don't create it for yourself.

28:01.666 --> 28:02.666
Not even time.

28:03.041 --> 28:04.041
If you want it,

28:04.500 --> 28:05.458
take it.

28:05.458 --> 28:06.708
If you're unsure,

28:06.791 --> 28:08.083
don't put your boddy through it.

28:08.166 --> 28:09.166
Understood?

28:09.375 --> 28:10.291
Yes, sir.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.291
Let's work.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.291
(Hip-Hop music continues)

28:32.916 --> 28:33.916
(Coach whistles)

28:39.375 --> 28:40.250
Dereck: What's up, Coach?

28:40.250 --> 28:41.000
Hey, man!

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
You're pretty good.

28:42.291 --> 28:43.291
Thank you. Thank you.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.041
'Preciate ya.

28:44.041 --> 28:46.000
Coach: Yeah, but you could
be better though.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.000
I'm not sure what you mean.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.500
Training won't be your battle.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
It's none of my business...

28:51.416 --> 28:52.583
but my business is

28:52.583 --> 28:54.041
if you're gonna be an athlete here,

28:54.083 --> 28:55.708
I need you to give me a hundred percent.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.500
Not only mentally,

28:57.625 --> 28:58.625
but physically.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.208
Win, lose, or draw...

29:00.291 --> 29:01.791
it takes one second

29:02.000 --> 29:03.541
to change somebody's life.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.083
And that life

29:05.166 --> 29:06.166
could be yours.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.208
You let me know when you're ready
to give a hundred percent...

29:08.666 --> 29:09.958
and I'll be right out there.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.458
So until then...

29:11.458 --> 29:12.458
go and train.

29:16.833 --> 29:18.166
(bell dings)

29:23.625 --> 29:24.625
(quiet footsteps)

29:29.166 --> 29:31.583
(Ominous sounds)

29:46.166 --> 29:51.250
(Eerie sound steadily rises)

29:51.375 --> 29:52.375
Hey hey!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Hey! Um...

29:54.208 --> 29:55.208
What are you doing here?

29:55.500 --> 29:57.000
I got off work early.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.458
I just wanted to know
if you wanna go have lunch at my mom's.

29:59.458 --> 30:00.875
Chris: Ah babe, that is so sweet,

30:00.875 --> 30:02.458
but I just got off my lunch.

30:02.458 --> 30:03.625
That's too bad.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.000
Yeah, you should've called!

30:05.250 --> 30:06.541
I wanted to surprise you.

30:06.541 --> 30:08.083
And you did, babe.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.750
You know I wish I could see you every day
in the middle of the day like this,

30:10.750 --> 30:12.541
but I gotta get ready for this meeting.

30:12.541 --> 30:13.958
Unless it's something on your mind?

30:14.291 --> 30:15.000
Eh...

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
No. I...

30:16.291 --> 30:17.583
just wanted to see you.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.750
Well, thank you for making my day
that much better.

30:20.416 --> 30:21.416
I love you.

30:21.416 --> 30:22.416
Nailah: I love you too.

30:22.416 --> 30:23.416
Call me later.

30:23.416 --> 30:24.416
Okay. I...

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
(door closes)

30:34.166 --> 30:36.250
(boxing training sounds)

30:36.958 --> 30:37.791
Intercom: Yo Dereck.

30:37.791 --> 30:40.000
You got a lady at the front here
to see you, man.

30:42.916 --> 30:43.916
Dereck: What's up? What you doing here?

30:44.375 --> 30:47.041
Hey! I wanted to know if you were done.
You not answering your phone.

30:47.041 --> 30:48.625
Ah! I left my phone in the locker.

30:48.791 --> 30:49.791
No distractions.

30:49.791 --> 30:50.791
Okay, cool.

30:50.791 --> 30:51.875
So how long you got?

30:52.083 --> 30:54.375
Oh about... hour hour and a half.

30:54.708 --> 30:55.708
Why? What's up?

30:55.708 --> 30:58.750
Well, I wanted to know if you wanted to
go to my mother's, cause she's cooking?

30:58.750 --> 30:59.750
Free food?

31:00.125 --> 31:01.125
And you not cooking?

31:01.500 --> 31:02.500
Boy!

31:02.750 --> 31:03.625
Give me one second.

31:03.625 --> 31:04.333
I'm fixing to go change.

31:04.333 --> 31:04.958
I'm fixing to go change.
Nailah: Hurry up!

31:04.958 --> 31:05.958
I'm fixing to go change.
Nailah: Hurry up!
Dereck: Alright!

31:28.875 --> 31:29.875
(door slides open)

31:32.041 --> 31:33.041
Nailah: Mama!

31:33.166 --> 31:35.000
Ms Ross: Who's that walking in my house?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.250
Nailah: Where are you?

31:36.250 --> 31:38.291
Ms Ross: That's not what I asked.

31:40.375 --> 31:43.250
Well, to answer your question
it's called a key.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.708
Mom, you remember Chris' brother Dereck.

31:45.708 --> 31:48.083
Yes! Yes, I remember him!

31:48.083 --> 31:49.375
I'm not that old!

31:49.375 --> 31:50.916
(Ms Ross laughs)

31:51.041 --> 31:52.833
Hey, Dereck, baby.

31:52.833 --> 31:53.958
How you doing?

31:54.041 --> 31:54.583
Dereck: I'm good.

31:54.583 --> 31:55.250
Ms Ross: Good!

31:55.250 --> 31:56.875
How's the move been so far?

31:56.875 --> 31:58.208
Dereck: It's been good! It's been good.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.458
Especially staying with Nailah and Chris.

32:00.458 --> 32:01.458
Good.

32:02.041 --> 32:04.125
So, where's Chris, Nailah?

32:04.208 --> 32:05.208
Oh, he's working.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.208
Hmm...

32:06.416 --> 32:07.500
That man.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.083
Work work work.

32:09.875 --> 32:10.666
Well, y'all...

32:10.666 --> 32:11.625
let's eat.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.875
Plates are over there.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.916
Water and juice in the fridge.

32:14.916 --> 32:16.333
Y'all help yourself.

32:18.125 --> 32:24.208
(nailah vomiting)

32:29.875 --> 32:33.125
(toilet flushes)

33:05.458 --> 33:08.250
Beautiful afternoon we're having,
isn't it?

33:08.625 --> 33:09.625
Yes, it is.

33:10.208 --> 33:11.375
Uh huh!

33:11.583 --> 33:13.541
So, what's under your skin today?

33:14.750 --> 33:16.166
Who's skin? Mine?

33:16.166 --> 33:17.166
Mm hmm.

33:17.750 --> 33:18.583
Nothing!

33:18.583 --> 33:19.541
Lunch was good.

33:19.541 --> 33:20.416
We laughed.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.416
We talked.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.458
That's what makes me ask.

33:24.208 --> 33:25.875
Look how defensive you are.

33:26.041 --> 33:29.250
You just described our afternoon
as if I wasn't even there.

33:29.250 --> 33:31.041
Nothing is wrong, mother.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.250
Everything is fine. Not a care in the world.

33:34.375 --> 33:36.500
But what world are you living in?

33:36.500 --> 33:38.791
Why do you do this every time I come here?

33:38.958 --> 33:40.666
I'm not trying to upset you.

33:40.666 --> 33:43.208
I just want to check and make that you're okay.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.291
I have my thoughts and my feelings!

33:45.291 --> 33:46.625
What are you feeling?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.916
Whatever you want to ask, just ask!

33:48.916 --> 33:52.666
I just want you to know
that I'm here without judgement.

33:52.666 --> 33:53.458
Ms Ross: Every marriage has

33:53.458 --> 33:54.458
Oh!

33:54.458 --> 33:55.791
It's about my marriage.

33:55.791 --> 33:57.750
Yes! It is!

33:58.458 --> 33:59.208
Okay!

33:59.208 --> 34:00.208
I see!

34:00.208 --> 34:01.458
The absenteeism.

34:01.458 --> 34:02.916
The bad excuses.

34:02.916 --> 34:03.916
The bruises.

34:04.041 --> 34:04.916
I remember those!

34:04.916 --> 34:06.375
You remember nothing!

34:07.958 --> 34:10.583
My father pushed you once
and you left him.

34:11.166 --> 34:14.791
You stripped me of a life with my father
because of a mistake.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.041
Not to mention, you wre cursing him
like you had no respect for him.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.166
No.

34:19.166 --> 34:22.333
No, mother, I will not
be alone at sixty-five.

34:23.541 --> 34:24.833
You may not get it...

34:25.208 --> 34:26.208
but I do.

34:26.916 --> 34:28.416
My husband...

34:28.666 --> 34:29.666
loves me!

34:31.500 --> 34:35.000
I'm sorry that you feel that way
about your daddy and me...

34:35.083 --> 34:36.416
but you're wrong.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.500
I just hope that you don't end up...

34:38.500 --> 34:39.750
dead wrong!

34:49.708 --> 34:51.416
(keyboard typing)

35:22.625 --> 35:25.958
(keyboard typing)

35:28.333 --> 35:29.333
Principal: Nailah.

35:29.458 --> 35:29.958
Yes?

35:29.958 --> 35:32.083
I'm so glad I caught you.
I need a big favor from you.

35:32.333 --> 35:33.333
Okay?

35:33.458 --> 35:36.125
Could you please pick up the decorations
for the Summer charity event?

35:36.333 --> 35:38.000
I'll write you the check tomorrow
if you pay for them.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
I think it's going to be like...

35:39.708 --> 35:41.041
Six-hundred and fifty dollars.

35:41.583 --> 35:43.833
Sure! I just have to check my account
to be safe.

35:43.916 --> 35:45.041
But I'm sure it's fine.

35:45.125 --> 35:45.666
Great.

35:45.666 --> 35:46.333
Thank you.

35:46.333 --> 35:47.541
You're a life saver.

35:51.625 --> 35:52.625
(mouse click)

35:54.125 --> 35:55.125
(mouse click)

36:03.083 --> 36:04.708
(printer printing)

36:12.750 --> 36:22.125
(ominous tones rising)

36:23.125 --> 36:24.125
Paula: Knock knock!

36:24.541 --> 36:25.541
(nervous laugh)

36:25.625 --> 36:26.375
Hey, Paula.

36:26.375 --> 36:26.875
Hey!

36:26.875 --> 36:27.708
You okay?

36:27.708 --> 36:28.541
I'm good!

36:28.541 --> 36:29.791
What's going on? How are you?

36:29.875 --> 36:31.875
I had some extra time, and...

36:31.875 --> 36:33.625
I was wondering if you had some extra time

36:33.625 --> 36:36.541
so that maybe we could get a jump start
on our sessions?

36:36.750 --> 36:37.541
Nailah: Um...

36:37.541 --> 36:38.333
Yeah.

36:38.333 --> 36:39.208
Um...

36:39.208 --> 36:41.958
I have to go downtown to get decorations
so I guess I could

36:42.166 --> 36:44.125
wait till traffic dies down
before I leave.

36:44.125 --> 36:45.125
Perfect.

36:45.416 --> 36:46.833
I'll go and get my notepad

36:46.833 --> 36:47.833
and then we can walk

36:48.041 --> 36:49.416
and talk and sip some tea

36:49.416 --> 36:50.708
and TALK some tea.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.708
Nailah: Okie dokie!

36:54.250 --> 36:55.458
(high heel footsteps fading)

37:11.500 --> 37:13.833
Paula: What people think has
always been amazing to me.

37:13.833 --> 37:14.541
You know?

37:14.541 --> 37:16.458
How the mind works.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.666
How it grows and diminishes.

37:19.041 --> 37:21.000
So that's why you got into counseling?

37:21.000 --> 37:23.291
Well, I've always been good
at reading people.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.000
And I enjoy helping them
come up with a solution for

37:26.000 --> 37:27.958
whatever problem they
feel they might have.

37:28.291 --> 37:29.875
Nailah: Have you ever been wrong?

37:29.875 --> 37:30.875
Yes.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.416
What did you do?

37:32.708 --> 37:33.708
Well...

37:34.625 --> 37:37.750
sometimes I had enough time
to help them fix it.

37:38.916 --> 37:40.041
Nailah: And the others?

37:43.041 --> 37:44.791
It was too late.

37:49.291 --> 37:50.291
Paula: Yes.

37:50.708 --> 37:51.708
Paula: Uh...

37:51.708 --> 37:52.708
Yes!

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Yes.

37:54.000 --> 37:54.916
Um okay.

37:54.916 --> 37:55.916
Good. Yes.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.041
Okay.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.000
Alright.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Ok.

37:59.083 --> 38:01.166
God!
(laughs)

38:01.958 --> 38:03.125
So what was that about?

38:03.125 --> 38:04.291
Paula: That was the cable installer.

38:04.291 --> 38:06.166
He's been trying to
schedule with me for days,

38:06.166 --> 38:07.500
but I just don't have time for it.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.458
Oh, yes, they can be pushy.

38:09.458 --> 38:10.958
Paula: Very pushy.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.041
So.

38:12.375 --> 38:13.375
What's going on with you?

38:13.583 --> 38:16.583
Oh well, just taking down all the
posters in the classroom.

38:16.583 --> 38:17.333
And trying to finish-

38:17.333 --> 38:18.291
Nooooo.

38:18.291 --> 38:19.208
No!

38:19.208 --> 38:20.791
What seems to be the problem?

38:21.083 --> 38:22.291
Oooh.

38:22.541 --> 38:24.291
I'm on the couch now.

38:24.291 --> 38:25.541
Paula: Don't worry!
(giggles)

38:25.541 --> 38:27.333
I'm not gonna charge you for it.

38:27.958 --> 38:30.250
Well... um...

38:30.250 --> 38:30.833
Oh!

38:30.833 --> 38:31.833
You see there?

38:32.416 --> 38:34.375
Right there.
You just thought of something.

38:34.375 --> 38:36.791
You just thought of something
and that's what we want to talk about.

38:36.791 --> 38:38.291
That's what needs to be here.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.416
I wasn't thinking about anything.

38:40.416 --> 38:42.541
I don't know.
Now it seems like you're lying.

38:42.708 --> 38:45.458
I don't know what you're thinking,
but I have nothing to hide.

38:45.458 --> 38:46.416
(Paula laughs)

38:46.416 --> 38:47.625
Classic!

38:47.625 --> 38:48.416
What?

38:48.416 --> 38:51.083
Nobody said that you were hiding anything!

38:51.083 --> 38:53.958
You see, this is the part where
the subconscious starts to tell on you.

38:53.958 --> 38:54.708
(laughs)

38:54.708 --> 38:55.708
(gasp)

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
So what is it?

38:57.500 --> 38:58.625
Late night clubbing!

38:58.708 --> 38:59.458
(both laugh)

38:59.458 --> 39:00.208
Paula: Come on!

39:00.208 --> 39:02.250
Flask in the classroom?

39:02.250 --> 39:03.000
(gasp)

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I got it.

39:05.250 --> 39:06.583
The over...

39:06.583 --> 39:08.041
protective...

39:08.041 --> 39:08.791
husband!

39:08.791 --> 39:09.583
(mug bangs on table)

39:09.583 --> 39:10.625
I am NOT

39:10.625 --> 39:12.083
hiding anything!

39:12.875 --> 39:13.541
Uh...

39:13.541 --> 39:14.541
O... o...

39:14.541 --> 39:15.125
O... okay!

39:15.125 --> 39:16.666
I'm... I'm sorry! I...
(nervous laugh)

39:16.666 --> 39:17.666
I'm sorry.

39:17.666 --> 39:20.791
I need to go get the decorations
before the store closes.

39:21.125 --> 39:21.916
Nailah: Thank you for your time.

39:21.916 --> 39:22.916
Nailah: Thank you for your time.
Paula: Okay.

39:24.083 --> 39:26.250
Nailah: Yes, I'm calling
about a reservation.

39:27.166 --> 39:30.333
Yes, the confirmation number is...

39:30.791 --> 39:31.791
D-K-L

39:31.958 --> 39:33.250
5-0-3

39:33.500 --> 39:36.125
1-5-4-5-5-9

39:36.958 --> 39:38.791
Yes, when was the reservation.

39:39.833 --> 39:41.125
It's for tonight?

39:42.125 --> 39:43.125
No! No.

39:43.125 --> 39:44.125
Thank you.

39:47.958 --> 39:51.083
(Orchestra music)

40:10.666 --> 40:12.333
Receptionist: Hi. Welcome to Howard.
How may I help you?

40:12.458 --> 40:15.958
Um yes. I wanted to know if you
had a room for a Christopher Belle?

40:16.916 --> 40:17.916
Receptionist: And that's Belle?

40:18.208 --> 40:19.208
Yes.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.958
B-E-L-L-E

40:21.041 --> 40:22.250
Yes, we do. Would you like to call him
down or leave a message?

40:22.250 --> 40:23.000
Yes, we do. Would you like to call him
down or leave a message?
Nailah: Uh! N...n...

40:23.000 --> 40:23.458
No!

40:23.458 --> 40:25.375
No, I just wanted to know if he was here.

40:25.375 --> 40:26.375
Thank you.

40:27.041 --> 40:28.791
Hey! Are you Mrs. Belle?

40:30.083 --> 40:31.083
Yes.

40:31.250 --> 40:32.250
One second

40:36.250 --> 40:37.500
Room 9-0-7, Mrs. Belle.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.458
I hope you and your husband enjoy
the rest of your stay.

40:43.083 --> 40:44.083
Thank you.

40:48.625 --> 40:54.041
(Somber music)

41:32.583 --> 41:35.583
(Music fades)

41:35.708 --> 41:36.541
(lock claps)

41:36.541 --> 41:38.166
(ominous tremble)

41:38.416 --> 41:39.875
(door creaks)

41:40.541 --> 41:46.291
(ominous tremble)

41:47.125 --> 41:48.583
(door creaks)

41:48.958 --> 41:50.750
(ominous tremble)

41:50.916 --> 41:52.291
(door creaks)

41:52.291 --> 41:53.291
(door snaps closed)

41:53.666 --> 42:25.250
(heartbeat thumps)

42:25.250 --> 42:33.000
(female laughter)

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
(heartbeats stop)

42:36.125 --> 42:38.166
Naked Woman: You know they're going to
kill you at the office, right?

42:38.541 --> 42:39.541
(eerie sound)

42:42.333 --> 42:43.500
Nick: Like I care.

42:44.875 --> 42:46.208
Time for round two.

42:46.375 --> 42:47.875
(playful noises and laughter)

42:50.208 --> 42:52.458
Jada: I'm just saying, it's refreshing
to see you in something

42:52.458 --> 42:54.708
other than a white tee and a do-rag.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.208
See, this do-rag is to keep my hair fresh.

42:58.666 --> 43:00.333
But you wouldn't know nothing about that.

43:00.875 --> 43:01.333
(slap)

43:01.333 --> 43:03.125
Oh, so you got jokes now.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.791
Were they pulling your hair in jail?

43:04.791 --> 43:05.833
Mr Avatar!

43:05.833 --> 43:06.750
Yeah.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.166
I didn't think so.

43:11.875 --> 43:13.208
Dereck: It's been about three years.

43:13.208 --> 43:15.166
Dereck: You crazy if you think I'm not.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.333
Jada: No, you are.

43:16.333 --> 43:18.500
Like loco. I don't have time for this.

43:18.500 --> 43:19.500
Hey. Hey.

43:20.666 --> 43:22.166
Take this back there right quick.

43:22.166 --> 43:23.166
I'll be there in a minute.

43:23.166 --> 43:24.166
Everything okay?

43:24.291 --> 43:25.708
Yeah, I'm a just talk to her right quick.

43:25.958 --> 43:26.625
Okay.

43:26.625 --> 43:27.625
Alight.

43:31.083 --> 43:32.875
Everything okay?

43:32.875 --> 43:33.875
Yeah.

43:34.250 --> 43:35.500
Everything's fine.

43:35.541 --> 43:36.458
How was training?

43:36.458 --> 43:37.916
It was fine.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.166
You sure? I've never
seen you drink before.

43:41.583 --> 43:42.583
It's grape juice.

43:43.458 --> 43:44.458
Really?

43:45.083 --> 43:46.083
Yeah.

43:46.375 --> 43:47.375
Okay, so what's that?

43:47.791 --> 43:48.791
It's nothing!

43:48.791 --> 43:51.000
I'm just behind on a few bills.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Really?

43:52.666 --> 43:53.666
Yeah.

43:57.916 --> 43:59.208
It's nothing!

43:59.875 --> 44:02.333
Okay, it's a bank statement. What's wrong?

44:05.916 --> 44:07.458
Well, this gotta be wrong, right?

44:07.500 --> 44:09.166
I went to the hotel.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.458
I saw the woman.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.583
In his room.

44:14.166 --> 44:15.750
His bed.

44:16.916 --> 44:17.916
Naked.

44:19.166 --> 44:20.458
So what you gon do?

44:20.750 --> 44:21.750
About what?

44:22.541 --> 44:24.166
About him cheating?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.708
You are going to say something, right?

44:30.416 --> 44:31.416
Yeah.

44:32.458 --> 44:33.458
You sure?

44:34.000 --> 44:37.666
Yeah, when I find the words to say
to bring it up without accusing?

44:37.750 --> 44:38.750
Accusing him?

44:39.833 --> 44:40.833
Don't get me wrong.

44:41.250 --> 44:44.125
Hope everything works out.
Hope you guys are good.

44:44.666 --> 44:46.833
But brother or no brother...

44:47.458 --> 44:49.083
if you saw him, he's wrong.

44:49.083 --> 44:50.333
I'll handle it!

44:50.833 --> 44:52.875
Everybody makes mistakes.

44:53.333 --> 44:54.333
Everybody.

44:56.416 --> 44:57.291
Wow.

44:57.291 --> 44:58.291
What?

44:59.791 --> 45:00.791
What!?

45:02.416 --> 45:04.791
You fought half the battle
for him already.

45:12.083 --> 45:13.750
But I am sorry, though.

45:29.208 --> 45:30.208
So...

45:30.708 --> 45:32.416
Where have you been?

45:34.208 --> 45:36.166
Why would I ask a question like that?

45:38.666 --> 45:41.583
Make this your last time!

45:43.291 --> 45:44.541
Hell no!

45:47.416 --> 45:48.416
(exhales)

45:51.250 --> 45:53.250
I can do this.

45:55.291 --> 45:56.541
(exhales)

46:01.750 --> 46:03.541
(front door opens)

46:05.708 --> 46:06.416
Hey!

46:06.416 --> 46:07.416
Chris: Hey!

46:08.250 --> 46:10.500
Chris: I have missed you so much.

46:11.875 --> 46:13.333
How was your trip?

46:13.500 --> 46:14.958
Chris: Ah, it was good.

46:14.958 --> 46:16.333
Chris: Got a lot of work done.

46:18.083 --> 46:18.958
(kiss smack)

46:18.958 --> 46:21.416
We had meetings a lot.
That's why I couldn't talk much.

46:21.416 --> 46:22.666
Nailah: At all?

46:22.666 --> 46:23.458
Chris: Hm?

46:23.458 --> 46:24.916
We didn't talk...

46:24.916 --> 46:25.916
at all.

46:26.083 --> 46:27.083
Oh.

46:27.083 --> 46:29.083
Well, you know how these conferences go.

46:29.250 --> 46:32.041
By the time it's over, I'm so beat
I just wanna lay down.

46:32.083 --> 46:33.083
Yeah.

46:34.708 --> 46:37.958
I had to go online to check the account...

46:38.500 --> 46:41.208
and I saw the card was being used.

46:41.500 --> 46:42.500
Ok?

46:43.291 --> 46:45.666
It was used to get a room at the Howard.

46:46.333 --> 46:48.166
Here in Houston.

46:50.750 --> 46:52.625
Not sure what you're insinuating.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.625
Go ahead and say what you're gonna say.

46:55.041 --> 46:56.416
I came...

46:56.416 --> 46:57.708
to the hotel...

46:57.916 --> 46:59.125
and saw you...

46:59.208 --> 47:00.458
with that woman.

47:01.541 --> 47:02.875
You didn't see me with nobody.

47:02.875 --> 47:03.958
Did I see you?

47:04.125 --> 47:05.875
No, you didn't.

47:06.708 --> 47:08.416
You were busy at the time.

47:08.791 --> 47:11.541
So why didn't you say something,
if you so sure you saw me?

47:11.750 --> 47:14.916
The room was reserved and paid for by you.

47:14.916 --> 47:17.708
And I saw you in there with that woman.

47:18.208 --> 47:20.791
You think I would stand here,
look you in the face, and lie to you?

47:20.791 --> 47:23.250
No, but I saw you.

47:23.333 --> 47:23.916
Oh.

47:23.916 --> 47:24.625
Okay.

47:24.625 --> 47:25.708
So I'm a liar.

47:26.250 --> 47:27.833
Let me tell you some truth.

47:29.458 --> 47:30.875
You didn't see me.

47:32.291 --> 47:35.208
I was in New York like I said I was.

47:37.291 --> 47:39.500
Look at the time, date, and location.

47:39.791 --> 47:44.750
Those photos were taken in Times Square
last night when you so-called saw me.

47:45.416 --> 47:47.083
But I saw her.

47:47.416 --> 47:49.583
Oh, the girl. You saw the girl.

47:49.750 --> 47:51.250
And you saw Nick!

47:51.250 --> 47:52.500
Not me!

47:52.875 --> 47:56.333
I paid for the room so it would stay
off of Nick's card.

47:56.625 --> 47:57.625
Oh!

47:58.458 --> 47:59.458
Baby, I'm so-

47:59.625 --> 48:00.625
(ominous tremble)

48:03.291 --> 48:05.666
All I do is try to make you happy.

48:06.583 --> 48:09.291
I bust my ass to make sure you have the things you need.

48:09.291 --> 48:10.416
And you...

48:10.458 --> 48:11.916
don't appreciate any of it.

48:11.916 --> 48:14.166
I know, baby, it was a mistake.

48:17.833 --> 48:18.833
(Nailah gasps)

48:20.125 --> 48:21.666
We've talked enough.

48:22.125 --> 48:23.375
I'm done hearing you.

48:23.375 --> 48:24.958
Baby, wait wait. Let me explain tha-

48:24.958 --> 48:25.750
(slap)

48:25.750 --> 48:26.666
Explain what!?

48:26.666 --> 48:28.458
Now you wanna explain?

48:29.750 --> 48:30.375
(Nailah gasps)

48:30.375 --> 48:31.375
(slams on couch)

48:33.250 --> 48:34.458
Tell me something!

48:34.583 --> 48:36.875
When are you going to start trusting me
the way I love and trust you?

48:36.875 --> 48:37.875
I do!

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
No you don't.

48:39.083 --> 48:40.083
No you don't.

48:40.166 --> 48:43.333
Because if you did, you wouldn't be
out sneaking trying to follow me.

48:43.333 --> 48:44.500
Are the bills not paid!?

48:44.500 --> 48:45.500
Yes!

48:45.625 --> 48:47.375
Am I taking care of home? Huh!?

48:47.375 --> 48:48.375
Yes!

48:48.458 --> 48:49.458
Another woman?

48:49.541 --> 48:51.958
Another woman, that's
what you worried about?

48:51.958 --> 48:53.041
Baby, I'm sorry.

48:53.291 --> 48:54.291
No.

48:54.500 --> 48:57.666
When are you going to get it through
your head that I love you?

48:58.250 --> 48:59.250
I know!

48:59.666 --> 49:00.541
No.

49:00.541 --> 49:01.541
No you don't.

49:02.083 --> 49:03.083
But you will.

49:03.875 --> 49:04.875
Come here.

49:16.083 --> 49:18.083
(musis plays)

49:18.083 --> 49:19.083
Nailah: Okay.

49:20.041 --> 49:21.041
Okay okay.

49:21.291 --> 49:23.875
It's going to be over in a minute.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.666
(music plays)

49:25.666 --> 49:27.458
It's going to be over...

49:27.458 --> 49:28.291
in a minute.

49:28.666 --> 49:30.333
He's not trying to hurt me.

49:30.708 --> 49:32.375
He loves me!

49:32.583 --> 49:33.166
He

49:33.166 --> 49:34.166
loves me.

49:34.791 --> 49:35.791
I know.

49:36.083 --> 49:37.083
I know I know it.

49:37.166 --> 49:38.958
(gasp)

49:39.083 --> 49:40.958
He's gonna kill me.

49:40.958 --> 50:04.875
(music plays)

50:04.916 --> 50:06.500
I love you.

50:06.500 --> 50:21.291
(music plays)

50:21.291 --> 50:23.041
(echoey knock knock knock)

50:23.041 --> 50:32.875
(music plays)

50:32.875 --> 50:33.875
(knocks on front door)

50:40.750 --> 50:41.750
Officer: Good evening, sir.

50:42.208 --> 50:44.166
Good evening, officer. How can I help you?

50:44.666 --> 50:47.166
I'm responding to a disturbance call
from one of your neighbors.

50:47.166 --> 50:48.708
Officer: Is everything okay this evening?

50:48.708 --> 50:51.000
Uh yeah! A disturbance call to MY address?

50:51.125 --> 50:54.041
Yeah, one of your neighbors said they
heard a lot of arguing and screaming.

50:54.583 --> 50:56.500
Well I JUST got back in town.

50:56.500 --> 50:57.500
Oh! My brother...

50:57.500 --> 51:00.083
he's got his workout equipment
set up in the garage, so he...

51:00.083 --> 51:03.208
might've been a little too loud singing
with his headphones on again.

51:03.208 --> 51:05.875
Officer: Okay okay, just make sure
your brother keep it to a minimum, okay?

51:05.875 --> 51:07.166
Chris: Yeah, no problem. No problem.

51:07.166 --> 51:09.875
Have y'all been getting any disturbance
calls in this area lately?

51:10.000 --> 51:12.833
No, not as of late, but this is
the first in a couple of weeks.

51:12.833 --> 51:15.083
And it is mandatory that I
do come and check it out.

51:15.083 --> 51:15.916
Gotcha. Gotcha.

51:15.916 --> 51:17.333
Understood. Just doing your job.

51:17.500 --> 51:18.500
Thank you, sir. You have a good evening.

51:18.541 --> 51:19.541
You do the same.

51:19.541 --> 52:56.958
(R&B music)

53:11.125 --> 53:12.125
(Paula clears her throat)

53:14.083 --> 53:15.083
Oh! Hey, Paula!

53:15.083 --> 53:16.083
Hey!

53:16.083 --> 53:19.666
Did you get the messages that I left in
your mailbox last week about seeing me?

53:19.666 --> 53:20.666
Yes, I did.

53:20.875 --> 53:23.708
So, do you think you will have
some time today or tomorrow?

53:24.083 --> 53:25.083
Um...

53:26.000 --> 53:27.250
I will if I can.

53:27.291 --> 53:28.500
You sure about that?

53:28.916 --> 53:29.916
What do you mean?

53:30.250 --> 53:33.291
Well, it seems like you've been
avoiding talking to me.

53:33.291 --> 53:34.458
Why would I do that?

53:34.458 --> 53:35.458
I don't know.

53:36.625 --> 53:38.333
I have nothing to hide.

53:39.791 --> 53:40.791
(footsteps passing by)

53:41.083 --> 53:42.083
Really?

53:44.166 --> 53:45.166
Yes.

53:46.166 --> 53:50.041
So then why all the button-ups
and heavy make-up?

53:52.666 --> 53:55.125
I'll be in your office after school.

53:55.375 --> 53:56.791
If that's okay,

53:57.208 --> 53:58.208
Ms. Jordan.

53:58.625 --> 54:01.000
That would be fine, Mrs. Belle.

54:02.833 --> 54:04.750
(footsteps walking away)

54:05.291 --> 54:35.041
(music plays)

54:44.166 --> 54:46.250
Just watching you do your thing, man.

54:47.708 --> 54:50.125
You came all this way to
watch me do my thing?

54:50.250 --> 54:51.125
Nah!

54:51.166 --> 54:51.833
Nah man.

54:51.833 --> 54:53.791
Just wondering what you been up to?

54:55.708 --> 54:56.458
Working.

54:56.458 --> 54:57.833
I didn't come here for vacation.

54:58.125 --> 54:59.666
I see you. I see you.

54:59.791 --> 55:01.916
Aye, you too busy to grab
some lunch with your bro?

55:04.708 --> 55:06.458
Nah nah. Give me a minute.

55:09.750 --> 55:12.000
(refrigerators buzzing)

55:22.708 --> 55:23.708
So...

55:24.833 --> 55:26.875
I feel like I gotta ask you,
what's new with you, man?

55:27.458 --> 55:28.250
Oh...

55:28.250 --> 55:29.958
not too much. Um...

55:30.166 --> 55:32.000
Just got an exhibition fight.

55:32.083 --> 55:33.083
Dereck: So that's cool.
Congratulations!

55:33.083 --> 55:34.083
Dereck: Yeah, 'preciate ya.

55:34.458 --> 55:36.250
Other than that, uh...

55:36.500 --> 55:38.583
Been running around looking for a gig.

55:39.083 --> 55:40.041
And a um...

55:40.041 --> 55:41.041
apartment.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.750
Wait, an apartment? Why so soon?

55:42.791 --> 55:44.541
I thought you was gon try
to get stable first.

55:45.208 --> 55:46.875
Yeah, I mean, that's cool. I just-- you know

55:46.875 --> 55:49.625
I don't want to inconvenience
you guys anymore,

55:49.625 --> 55:50.583
Dereck: and not for too much longer.
Inconvenience?

55:50.583 --> 55:51.833
Who said you were an inconvenience?

55:51.833 --> 55:53.333
Did Nailah tell you that!?
No!

55:53.458 --> 55:54.791
No, not at all.

55:54.875 --> 55:56.916
You guys' hospitality has been great.

55:57.166 --> 56:01.000
Okay. So stop beating around the bush
and tell me what the problem is.

56:05.583 --> 56:06.416
Um...

56:06.416 --> 56:08.791
I came home like a couple weeks ago,

56:08.791 --> 56:09.791
and um...

56:10.000 --> 56:12.458
uh... saw you and Nailah, like, fighting.

56:14.333 --> 56:16.458
Chris: What exactly did you see?

56:19.541 --> 56:20.541
Oh.

56:21.375 --> 56:22.500
You saw that (clears throat).

56:24.583 --> 56:25.583
Okay.

56:25.666 --> 56:26.541
So...

56:26.541 --> 56:28.333
what is it you want to ask?

56:28.875 --> 56:30.750
I mean really bruh it's not none of my business.

56:30.750 --> 56:32.666
You're absolutely right, it's not!

56:32.791 --> 56:35.708
But since you asked,
what is it you want to know?

56:37.791 --> 56:39.625
Bro, we went through that
bullshit with pops.

56:39.625 --> 56:40.625
Pops!

56:40.958 --> 56:42.416
What bullshit did we go through with pops?

56:42.416 --> 56:43.083
No!

56:43.083 --> 56:45.750
What bullshit did YOU
go through with pops?

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Pops never laid a finger on you.
Never touched Junior!

56:51.250 --> 56:52.000
I didn't mean it like that.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.083
But Chris...

56:53.083 --> 56:54.416
I'm a beat his ass, he said.

56:54.541 --> 56:55.833
And he did!

56:56.083 --> 56:58.041
Now look at my life and look at yours.

56:58.458 --> 57:00.583
I ain't never been in jail or in trouble.

57:00.916 --> 57:02.291
Moms stayed with him faithfully

57:02.291 --> 57:03.583
till he DIED!

57:04.166 --> 57:05.583
And you look down on ME?

57:05.833 --> 57:06.416
ME!?

57:06.416 --> 57:07.416
(phone chimes)

57:09.666 --> 57:10.666
Shit.

57:11.833 --> 57:14.708
Now don't get me wrong.
I'm not perfect and I don't claim to be.

57:15.583 --> 57:17.125
But look, that's my house.

57:17.875 --> 57:20.541
And I don't EVER want
to get that mistaken again.

57:24.958 --> 57:26.333
Is that gonna be a probelm?

57:26.958 --> 57:27.958
Nah.

57:28.541 --> 57:29.541
Alright.

57:30.541 --> 57:31.541
Chris: I love you.

57:31.708 --> 57:32.708
Chris: Understand?

57:33.250 --> 57:34.250
Yeah, I love you.

57:39.875 --> 57:40.875
Fuck!

57:46.458 --> 57:47.833
(knocks on door)

57:47.916 --> 57:49.125
It's open.

57:53.000 --> 57:53.791
Hm.

57:53.791 --> 57:55.041
Have a seat.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Paula: So?

58:02.166 --> 58:03.166
So?

58:03.541 --> 58:05.250
You don't have anything to start with?

58:05.458 --> 58:08.375
I assumed you had something to say or ask.

58:08.375 --> 58:10.625
I didn't realize this was a
how are you doing meeting.

58:10.708 --> 58:11.958
Because it's not.

58:12.916 --> 58:14.125
Well, let's get to it.

58:14.125 --> 58:15.125
Paula: Okay.

58:15.541 --> 58:16.541
What are you scared of?

58:17.083 --> 58:18.083
(scoffs)

58:19.083 --> 58:19.750
Paula: No!

58:19.750 --> 58:20.750
Wait!

58:21.375 --> 58:23.041
Humor me for a moment.

58:23.125 --> 58:25.458
I don't have a moment for this.

58:25.750 --> 58:27.708
Either you'll have a moment now,

58:27.708 --> 58:30.625
or you'll have a moment when
I fill out that unfit to teach report

58:30.625 --> 58:33.541
and it looks into the home life
of the teacher.

58:33.708 --> 58:34.708
You choose.

58:38.833 --> 58:39.833
(drops bag)

58:41.875 --> 58:44.250
Why is that so scary to you?

58:44.708 --> 58:46.791
Looking into your home life?

58:47.583 --> 58:50.041
Or should I tell you?

58:51.708 --> 58:55.541
Nailah, I've never smelled alcohol on you.

58:55.708 --> 59:00.291
You don't appear to be shaky from drugs,
no anti-movements.

59:00.750 --> 59:02.750
You're not afraid to show your wrists

59:02.750 --> 59:04.500
so you're not suicidal.

59:04.916 --> 59:06.416
So that means...

59:06.416 --> 59:09.791
that the hidden bruises
on your chest and your back

59:09.791 --> 59:12.208
are not self-inflicted.

59:14.500 --> 59:18.708
Looking or threatening
to look into the home life

59:18.708 --> 59:22.375
and your marriage is what scares you.

59:22.750 --> 59:24.708
I know the signs!

59:25.166 --> 59:26.833
But I'll ask you anyway.

59:26.875 --> 59:30.708
Does your husband abuse you, Nailah?

59:31.250 --> 59:33.375
No matter what I say

59:33.791 --> 59:34.791
you know

59:35.458 --> 59:37.166
or you think you know.

59:37.666 --> 59:40.291
With all your degrees you think you know us.

59:40.291 --> 59:41.208
But you'd be wrong!

59:41.208 --> 59:43.250
Paula: You didn't answer--
Nailah: Let me finish!

59:43.583 --> 59:45.041
I love my husband.

59:45.041 --> 59:47.333
And he loves me, I know it.

59:48.625 --> 59:51.708
But we all have that thing
in life we battle with.

59:52.291 --> 59:54.666
But where I'm from when you say I do,

59:54.791 --> 59:59.458
it means for better or worse,
richer or poorer, thick or thin.

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:04.666
So, you can go ahead and fill out your
report about what you think you know.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.208
But I choose my marriage.

01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:09.833
And I love these children,

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:13.125
and I would never do
anything to hurt them.

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:15.875
But you have a job to do.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:18.958
I'll clean out my desk.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Paula: Nailah.

01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:25.000
I'll fill out the report,

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.125
and it's gonna clear you.

01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:32.083
Because my job is to
look out for those kids.

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:34.000
And I believe that they're okay.

01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:36.375
And I asked you to talk to me...

01:00:36.541 --> 01:00:37.541
and you did.

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:39.708
Thank you.

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:41.416
As a colleague...

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.500
it's none of my business.

01:00:43.958 --> 01:00:45.500
But as a woman...

01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:48.333
that can't be love, right?

01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:51.708
It's how he loves me.

01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:54.208
Then I'm petrified for you.

01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:57.791
I'm here

01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:00.250
whenever you need me.

01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:17.000
(music plays)

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.041
(crowd cheering)

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.458
Chris: Get him off you man!

01:01:35.791 --> 01:01:36.208
Coach: Go!

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:38.333
(sound is muffled)

01:01:40.541 --> 01:01:42.166
Coach: Go! There you go!

01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:05.583
Nailah: I didn't know
Dereck was that good.

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:06.958
The boy is nice.
(Nailah laughs)

01:02:06.958 --> 01:02:07.666
He's real nice.

01:02:07.666 --> 01:02:08.666
Dereck!

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:10.291
Nailah: You were amazing!

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:11.291
Really.

01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:12.083
Dereck: Thank you.
Nailah: Really Good.

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.125
Yeah. Man!

01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:15.166
I did not know what to expect.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.416
Great fight, dude!

01:02:16.416 --> 01:02:17.708
Well, I appreciate the confidence.

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:19.041
Hey, better late than never.

01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:20.375
I'll take that, I'll take that.

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.375
Hey, look...

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:22.875
Tomorrow we're gonna celebrate,

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:25.125
Nailah's gon cook, we gon
have a few people over, man.

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:27.500
Well actually, we finna get ready
to go to this after hours spot.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.041
If y'all wanna, like, come with us?

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:32.541
Well, I can't. I gotta go to the office
and get ready for this proposal tomorrow.

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.375
Right now?

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:33.833
Yeah!

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.333
Yeah. Nick didn't get everything ready.
I gotta go play Superman.

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:38.000
Bet hey, you oughta go with Dereck, though!

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah, it's still early.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.625
Nailah: Are you sure
I can't come with you?

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.333
I love watching you work.

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:45.125
Oh, I know sweetheart.
Not tonight though, some other time.

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:46.541
Hey Dereck, can she roll with you?

01:02:46.541 --> 01:02:49.166
Fa sho, man. You don't wanna
go to the office with him anyway.

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.750
I might need a responsible driver.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:51.458
(Nailah laughs)

01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:52.458
See?

01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:54.375
Chris: See? Go ahead
Hooded Guy: Hey, nice fighting tonight.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.041
Are you sure I can't come with you?

01:03:00.083 --> 01:03:02.375
Did you not hear what I just said?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.208
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:09.000
Now go with Dereck.

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:11.375
Alright, bruh.

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:12.708
Dereck: Alright, see you later.
Chris: Take it easy.

01:03:12.708 --> 01:03:13.708
You ready?

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:14.791
Yeah.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:15.791
Dereck: Let's go!

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:28.500
(music plays from inside club)

01:03:30.083 --> 01:03:34.458
Coach: (singing) We are the champions

01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:38.166
(singing) We are the ch--

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:40.500
(singing) cham--
(laughs)

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.083
Dereck: Unlock it.

01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:43.666
Dereck: Nah, unlock it. Unlock it.

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:45.958
Coach: (singing) We are...

01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:47.000
Yeah, we are.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
You... (drunken laugh)

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.000
You got one, but...

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.291
you got practice.
Alright!

01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:52.750
Coach: You got... you won one...
Dereck: Alright!

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:53.375
Dereck: Alright!

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:54.125
Coach: That's just one.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:55.125
Dereck: Alright.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:56.625
Alright!

01:03:57.791 --> 01:03:59.083
Coach: That's just one.
Dereck: Alright!

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:01.291
Dereck: You got him?
Coach: Practice!
Girl: Yeah, I got him.

01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:02.333
Alright, I'll see y'all tomorrow.

01:04:02.333 --> 01:04:03.875
Alright! Alright!

01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:14.541
You full?

01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:16.250
Yeah! I didn't even know
this place was right here.

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.750
Yeah, man.

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:19.833
Did you call Chris and tell him
we was on the way?

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:21.333
Yeah, he...

01:04:21.416 --> 01:04:22.416
he didn't answer.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.875
He's probably really busy, though.

01:04:25.041 --> 01:04:26.291
Yeah, so we gon beat him home?

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:27.916
Can we not go home?

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.291
I just don't wanna be there
right now, you know.

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:32.208
Dereck: Yeah.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.791
I mean... if that's okay with you.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:36.833
Yeah. Yeah yeah.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.625
I think I know the perfect place.

01:04:40.708 --> 01:04:42.625
(crickets chirping)

01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:44.916
Dereck: That's just ridiculous!

01:04:44.916 --> 01:04:46.250
Dereck: Man, I can't--
Nailah: How!?

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:47.666
Dereck: Because... I'm saying...

01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:50.708
If I'm walking and a lady walking
and we bump into each other,

01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:52.791
and she fall down because
I'm a little bit stronger,

01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:54.833
but I wasn't paying attention
and she wasn't paying attention,

01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:56.541
why I gotta say excuse me!?

01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:58.208
She supposed to say excuse me too!

01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:00.208
Why everybody gotta look at me
like I'm disgusting, though?

01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:01.208
like I'm disgusting, though?
Nailah: Shut up!

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:03.041
Just saying that's not EVEN!

01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:04.916
Nailah: You are ridiculous!

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:07.583
Do you do this?

01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:10.916
Yeah, mom used to bring us
here when we were kids.

01:05:10.916 --> 01:05:13.125
It's just somewhere to go
to clear your mind.

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:14.625
Nailah: Hm.

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:16.875
Let me ask you something.

01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:18.875
Shoot.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.000
Did you talk to Chris about cheating?

01:05:22.458 --> 01:05:23.458
Yeah, I did.

01:05:23.791 --> 01:05:24.791
What did he say?

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:27.208
We talked and figured it wasn't him.

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:28.208
It was Nick.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.500
I thought you saw him?

01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:30.666
It was late.

01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:31.958
I was stressed.

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.083
I don't know what I saw.

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:37.500
Did I know what I saw...

01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:39.166
when I saw him hit you?

01:05:39.416 --> 01:05:40.416
What!?

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:42.833
I was at home that day.

01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:44.708
Dereck, everybody just--

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:47.166
Makes mistakes. Makes mistakes.

01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:48.958
Yeah, I heard it.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:50.750
Did you talk to him?

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:54.166
Yep, and he said
it's none of my business...

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.333
He loves you, he loves you, blah...

01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:57.333
Right.

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:58.791
Everybody is different.

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:02.166
Everybody expresses
their love differently.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.416
That's how you see love?

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:04.208
Let me finish.

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:06.541
Nah! I can't belive this shit!

01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:08.291
It's not like it happens all the time.

01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:11.166
Doesn't matter. He does it! It happens!

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.666
The same thing went on with pops
and moms and mom stayed!

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.625
I can not understand it.

01:06:16.625 --> 01:06:18.083
It makes no sense

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:19.083
at all.

01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:20.750
Why do you stay?

01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:22.041
I'm pregnant.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Right now!?

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.250
Yeah.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.250
Six months.

01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:29.958
You six months pregnant right now?

01:06:29.958 --> 01:06:31.583
You not even showing!

01:06:31.916 --> 01:06:35.833
My mom was seven or eight months
before she started to show with me.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.875
Ah, does Chris know?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.958
I was gonna wait until after the
last business deal to tell him.

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:48.458
And no, it's not the only reason.

01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:51.125
We're gonna be one happy family.

01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:53.125
Yeah, The Manson family!

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:56.875
(slap)

01:06:57.666 --> 01:06:59.958
Don't you dare say nothing like that
about my family!

01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:01.458
Or my marriage!

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:06.458
I'm sorry.

01:07:06.458 --> 01:07:09.041
(footsteps in gravel walking away)

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.041
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

01:07:14.458 --> 01:07:16.083
(video game music and sounds)

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:17.916
Dereck: I'm a kick you out.
Is that your foot!?

01:07:17.916 --> 01:07:18.916
(Jada laughs)
Dereck: I'm not sure...

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:20.458
Dereck: If that's suppose to be happening.

01:07:22.916 --> 01:07:23.916
Dereck: Ah!

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.208
Dereck: Stop!

01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:27.000
Dereck: Stop.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.375
Dereck: Don't-- that's you cheating.
That's cheating.
(Jada laughs)

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:30.708
Dereck: That's cheating in like real life.

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:32.000
Dereck: You can't cheat like that.

01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:36.041
(clicks tongue)
Shit!

01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:37.041
Got you.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.500
Whatever.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.750
Do you have anymore soda in there?

01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:43.791
Uh...

01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:44.416
(can sounds nearly empty)

01:07:44.416 --> 01:07:45.000
Nah.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I think my brother got some
in the house, though.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:48.833
Good, can you go get me one, please?

01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:49.833
Uh... no.

01:07:50.083 --> 01:07:51.083
I'm still alive.

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:52.875
Oh!

01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:54.750
Jada: You wrong.
Dereck: Chill. I can't see.

01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:58.291
Bring me one.

01:07:58.708 --> 01:07:59.708
Jada: Bring you NOTHING!

01:07:59.833 --> 01:08:00.833
(door closes)

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:22.875
(gasp)

01:08:23.457 --> 01:08:24.457
Hey!

01:08:24.457 --> 01:08:26.457
Hey, Nailah. Are you okay?

01:08:26.457 --> 01:08:27.000
Yeah!

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.791
Did you need anything out the kitchen?

01:08:29.041 --> 01:08:32.125
I actually went in to get a soda,
but y'all are out.

01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:33.125
Oh... (laughs)

01:08:33.125 --> 01:08:36.041
Yeah, they drink sodas
like crazy around here.

01:08:36.375 --> 01:08:37.375
(silently)
Okay.

01:08:40.832 --> 01:08:41.916
Jada: It was good seeing you.

01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:42.916
You too.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.750
Whoa! What are you doing?

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:03.416
Why is Nailah's body so bruised,
and do not lie to me?

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.500
Chris?

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.041
Yeah.

01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:09.416
Why didn't you tell me?

01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:10.416
Tell you what?

01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:12.207
(scoffs) Okay, wrong question.

01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:15.082
So is she okay? Did he go to jail?
What happened?

01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:16.707
I don't know if she's okay.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.332
She act like it,

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.291
but some days when she not looking...

01:09:20.416 --> 01:09:22.082
I can tell she sore.

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.791
Did she tell you that's what it is?

01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:25.791
Nah, I saw it.

01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:29.082
And what did you say when you stopped him!?

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:30.082
I didn't.

01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:32.332
Why not?

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:33.957
Cause it's not none of my business.

01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:35.666
Is this something that you're on, too?

01:09:35.666 --> 01:09:37.041
Jada: Because I am not the one!
Dereck: Whoa whoa whoa!

01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:38.041
Calm down.

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:40.832
My pops beat my moms.

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:42.457
He also hit Chris.

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:45.000
He never touched me. I don't know if
it was cause I was too little...

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.957
but I would never put my hands on you,

01:09:46.957 --> 01:09:48.791
or any other female.

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:50.957
And that assault charge was to who?

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:52.666
That was towards a nigga in the club!

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.666
I had anger issues, but not towards women,

01:09:54.666 --> 01:09:56.666
but that's why I told you I was moving.

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:59.041
Why are you running?
Why don't you help her!?

01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:00.333
Help her do what!?

01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:02.375
I don't know. Talk some sense into him or something!

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:03.666
I already did!

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.791
He said it wasn't none of my business!

01:10:07.125 --> 01:10:09.750
Fuck. That. Report his ass.

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:11.666
I'm not calling the police on my brother.

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:13.458
And plus she think she pregnant.

01:10:15.333 --> 01:10:16.333
(scoffs)

01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:17.791
Dereck: Jay.

01:10:18.416 --> 01:10:19.416
Jay!

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:21.916
Jay!

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.083
That's all you got for me?

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:27.125
You already made up your mind
on what you're NOT gonna do.

01:10:27.208 --> 01:10:29.083
So let him kill her.

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:35.333
(Mrs. Ross laughing)

01:10:38.166 --> 01:10:39.916
And listen, you're right...

01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:42.875
but I am not about to pretend that I'm not old.

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:44.250
(both laugh)

01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:46.166
Now we're having fun!

01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:48.500
So this is the fun part?

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.291
Ooh! Yes! Sitting!?

01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:51.541
Mm hmm.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:54.000
So.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.500
Now why did you wanna hang out
with this old floozy today, hm?

01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:58.625
I told you.

01:10:58.666 --> 01:10:59.625
Uh uh.

01:10:59.625 --> 01:11:01.500
I can see right through that smirk.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.041
You've been wanting to
say something all day,

01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:06.083
so come on now. Spill it!

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:07.833
Well, I need a favor.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Okay so...

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
what do you need?

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:12.541
There's this concert I wanna go to...

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:15.083
and I wanna know if you'd babysit for me?

01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:19.500
So would I be babysitting for you!?

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:20.666
Yes, mama.

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:23.750
So...

01:11:24.208 --> 01:11:25.208
I...

01:11:25.416 --> 01:11:27.750
I... I'm gonna be a grandmother?

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.041
(Nailah laughs)
Yes.

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:31.000
Oh! (laughs)

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:32.958
Mrs. Ross: Yes!

01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:36.541
Yes, I guess I could be inconvenienced
a couple times for you.

01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:40.000
I knew you would.
(both laugh)

01:11:54.208 --> 01:12:10.208
(music plays)

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:12.125
Oh, baby!

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:55.500
(music plays)

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.041
Yeah, we just gon be a minute.

01:13:01.041 --> 01:13:03.916
I just can't run in and out,
cause I don't know where everything at.

01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:06.750
I do not wanna go in there.

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:09.458
Alright, look...

01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:11.250
Go drop off the mail that you got...

01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:14.500
and then just come back.
I'll try to get out as fast as I can.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.875
Just wait for me right here.

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.291
Alright. Okay.

01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:18.291
Alright.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:38.250
Hey, you called?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.416
Mrs. Ross: Yeah.

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:41.625
I wanted to see how everything went.

01:13:41.916 --> 01:13:43.666
Nailah: It hasn't went anywhere yet.

01:13:44.166 --> 01:13:46.541
Our afternoon together turned into an...

01:13:46.666 --> 01:13:48.208
evening or night together.

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.833
Oh. Why?

01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:52.250
Nailah: Just some last minute things
that came up at work.

01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:54.875
I'm just glad I didn't cook.
(laughs)

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:55.875
Yeah.

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:56.500
So...

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Are you scared?

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.458
Nervous?

01:13:58.458 --> 01:14:01.750
Mrs. Ross: Telling a man he's going to be
a father can be an emotional thing.

01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:02.958
More like...

01:14:03.416 --> 01:14:05.291
excited to tell him.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.708
This is a new beginning for us.

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:11.291
Mrs. Ross: Well, I wish you luck.

01:14:11.458 --> 01:14:12.666
Keep me posted.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.208
Okay.

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:15.083
(front door closes)
Oh!

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.708
I think I hear him coming in.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.250
Okay, bye.

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:21.500
Babe, is that you?

01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:26.000
Nailah: Oh! I thought you were Chris.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.250
Huh?

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:30.000
I said I thought you were Chris.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:30.791
Oh.

01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:32.958
Oh, nah. I just came in to grab something to eat.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:33.958
I'm sorry.

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:34.958
No problem.

01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:36.666
So you really out of here, huh?

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:37.750
Yeah, you know.

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:39.750
Think it's about that time.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.916
Gonna miss having you around.

01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:45.125
Would've been nice to have an in-home babysitter.

01:14:45.125 --> 01:14:46.708
(both laugh)

01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:49.083
I won't go far. Anytime.

01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:49.958
Anytime.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:51.000
Gonna hold you to that.

01:14:51.166 --> 01:14:52.375
Promise! Scout's honor.

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:53.750
(Nailah laughs)

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:22.375
Hey, Nick.

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:23.375
What's going on, man?

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:27.125
What!?

01:15:27.125 --> 01:15:28.583
I thought it was a shoe-in!?

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.125
Alright, man.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.166
Damn!

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:31.250
Nailah: Chris?

01:16:35.416 --> 01:16:36.416
Hey, baby.

01:16:36.916 --> 01:16:37.916
How was your day?

01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:39.166
Hectic.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.291
Glad it's over.

01:16:40.625 --> 01:16:41.791
Well...

01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:43.958
before you lay down...

01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:46.083
I've cooked.

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:48.333
I'm going to run you a bath.

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:51.125
I have some really important news to tell you.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:53.708
Babe, I'm really not up
for any us time tonight.

01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:55.416
Oh, I know you're tired...

01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:57.750
can you play along just for tonight?

01:16:58.708 --> 01:16:59.458
I need you.

01:16:59.458 --> 01:17:01.041
Need! Always need!

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
I do my best and something
else is always needed!

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.291
I'll be quick! I promise.

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.666
Was my tired reply not enough for you!?

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:09.250
Shit!

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:10.916
(Nailah exhales)

01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:12.833
Nailah: I'll just come back later.

01:17:15.916 --> 01:17:16.625
Chris: Okay!

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:17.833
Now you got my attention.

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:19.416
Baby, wait! You can't do this!

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.541
What? I can't!?

01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:21.541
I can't wh--

01:17:22.916 --> 01:17:23.916
(Nailah screams)

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:26.166
Don't tell me what the fuck
I can and can't do!

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.875
(loud bang)

01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:16.250
(Nailah breathes heavily)

01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:21.458
(Nailah whimpers in pain)

01:18:45.541 --> 01:18:46.208
Jada: Dereck!

01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:47.750
Dereck: Yo!
Jada: You have to help Nailah right now!

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.416
Chris is over there beating her ass!

01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:51.083
Dereck: Ok.
Jada: You have to go help her right now!

01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:53.208
He's going to kill her and that baby!
Dereck: Alright! Alright I got it!

01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:54.416
I got it! I got it!

01:18:56.416 --> 01:18:57.416
Oh my God.

01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:08.958
Where's Nailah?

01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:11.750
She in the bedroom, man.
She not feeling well.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:15.625
Not feeling well?

01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:19.083
Hey! Dereck!

01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:22.458
Dereck, hold on!
Hey, she not dressed, man!

01:19:47.625 --> 01:19:55.166
(faint whimpers from Nailah)

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:57.416
Chris: Hey, Dereck. Hey...

01:19:57.416 --> 01:19:58.416
let me talk to you, man.

01:19:59.041 --> 01:20:00.041
Dereck!

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:01.750
Hold on, man!

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.500
Hold on. Let me talk to you, man.

01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:08.291
(Chris coughing)

01:20:24.708 --> 01:20:26.916
You didn't even let her tell you, did you!?

01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:29.541
She's pregnant!!

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.583
Chris: You gonna call the cops on me?
(coughing)

01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:34.333
Dereck: The cops?

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:37.875
Dereck: You fucking worried
about the cops?

01:20:45.791 --> 01:20:47.375
Dad was right, bruh.

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.875
This is the only fucking way you learn.

01:20:54.166 --> 01:21:04.666
(ambulance siren wails)

01:21:07.875 --> 01:21:47.583
(music plays)

01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:51.958
(stretcher wheels rolling fast)

01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:53.750
EMT: Ma'am? Ma'am?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.958
Can you open your eyes for me?
Open your eyes, please?

01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:59.708
(stretcher wheels rolling fast)

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:01.791
(Nailah crying)
My baby!

01:22:05.416 --> 01:22:07.666
(vital signs monitor beeping)

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.458
Dr. Delgado: Ms. Belle?

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:14.083
(baby crying in the distance)

01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:30.458
Mrs. Belle, the baby didn't make it.

01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:32.708
(Nailah labored breathing)

01:22:45.333 --> 01:22:47.291
(Nailah continues to cry)

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:43.041
(vitals monitor echos in the distance)

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:45.500
(newborn transporter rolls by hastily)

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:09.125
Ms. Ross: You can stay here for
as long as you want, you know.

01:24:12.166 --> 01:24:12.916
You hungry?

01:24:12.916 --> 01:24:14.916
You want something to eat or drink?

01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:16.791
No.

01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:19.166
I just wanna get some rest.

01:24:20.666 --> 01:24:23.583
Alright, well, let me know
if you need anything.

01:24:28.166 --> 01:24:29.166
Mrs. Ross: But you...

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.416
You could've done something!

01:24:31.416 --> 01:24:32.416
Anything!

01:24:32.875 --> 01:24:33.875
But you didn't.

01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:35.875
So this is your fault...

01:24:35.958 --> 01:24:38.416
just as much as it's his.

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:39.750
I'm sorry!

01:24:41.416 --> 01:24:44.291
I'm burying my unborn grandbaby today.

01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:45.291
Your nephew!

01:24:45.666 --> 01:24:46.666
(scoffs)

01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:48.583
I'm sure you are.

01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:56.541
Nailah: No.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.250
No, I didn't!

01:24:58.375 --> 01:25:01.666
What I'm saying is, how can
they press charges if I'm not?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Nailah: Yes!

01:25:04.291 --> 01:25:06.791
Nailah: Yes, I will. I'll talk
to whoever I need to.

01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:09.708
I want my husband out of there
as soon as possible.

01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:12.291
I attacked him!

01:25:12.666 --> 01:25:14.541
Nailah: He was just defending himself.

01:25:16.416 --> 01:25:17.416
Yes!

01:25:20.125 --> 01:25:21.125
Thank you.

01:25:32.583 --> 01:25:35.541
(house is echoey, empty sounding)

01:27:03.083 --> 01:27:04.083
(book drops to the floor)

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:39.041
(Nailah cries softly)

01:27:43.916 --> 01:28:05.791
(Upbeat love music)

01:28:05.791 --> 01:28:13.166
(phone rings)

01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:15.125
Dereck's Voicemail:
You got me. Leave me a message.

01:28:15.125 --> 01:28:16.125
(voicemail beeps)

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:18.541
Chris: Hey, uh...

01:28:18.541 --> 01:28:20.875
Dereck, man... uh...

01:28:20.875 --> 01:28:21.583
You know

01:28:21.583 --> 01:28:22.750
I know what you think of me,

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:23.833
but...

01:28:23.833 --> 01:28:25.375
but I got some help.

01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:28.333
And I promise you I've changed.

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:30.916
I couldn't see it at first, but...

01:28:30.916 --> 01:28:32.666
I do now.

01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:34.750
And I am sorry.

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:35.250
I'm...

01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:36.958
SO sorry.

01:28:37.875 --> 01:28:39.333
I-- (exhales)

01:28:39.958 --> 01:28:40.958
Call me.

01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:47.458
(Upbeat love music)

01:28:59.208 --> 01:29:04.250
(music continues from phone)

01:29:30.916 --> 01:29:32.916
(gasps) Oh my God!

01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:36.083
(music stops)

01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:38.708
Chris: What happened?

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.250
I um...

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:42.791
I...

01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:43.791
don't um...

01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:45.875
I was ironing.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.416
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:00.750
It's alright, babe.

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:01.833
It's just a shirt.

01:30:01.833 --> 01:30:03.541
Thought you hurt yourself or something.

01:30:07.083 --> 01:30:08.083
Okay.

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:10.250
(music restarts)

01:30:27.416 --> 01:30:29.791
Chris: I do it because I love you.
(echoes)

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:38.166
Chris: Nobody will ever
understand us and our love.

01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:03.416
(music, shower, and clippers
all making noise)

01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:35.625
(all sounds fade into shellshock)

01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:42.458
(muffled gunshots)

01:32:10.333 --> 01:32:12.750
(door creaks)

01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:51.833
Paula: Nailah?

01:32:54.291 --> 01:32:55.291
Paula: Na--

01:32:57.166 --> 01:32:58.875
Nailah, are you okay?

01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:01.333
I got your text.

01:33:04.583 --> 01:33:06.583
Nailah, honey, are you okay?

01:33:09.208 --> 01:33:10.083
You said that...

01:33:10.083 --> 01:33:12.416
there was blood everywhere, Nailah.

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:15.958
Oh my God! Nailah!

01:33:16.333 --> 01:33:18.250
Nailah, where are you bleeding from?

01:33:19.083 --> 01:33:22.416
Nailah, the ambulance is on it's way,
but you gotta talk to me.

01:33:22.708 --> 01:33:23.708
Nailah!

01:33:36.333 --> 01:33:38.083
Is that Chris?

01:33:43.583 --> 01:33:44.833
He said...

01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:47.291
he did what he did...

01:33:47.583 --> 01:33:49.875
because he loved me.

01:33:51.833 --> 01:33:53.541
I should forgive him...

01:33:53.916 --> 01:33:56.541
because he loved me.

01:33:58.791 --> 01:34:00.500
The choking...

01:34:02.916 --> 01:34:05.583
slapping and punching...

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:07.875
was how he loved me.

01:34:14.333 --> 01:34:17.500
It's not out of anger, Nailah.

01:34:18.958 --> 01:34:22.291
It's because I love you.

01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:30.291
Paula: Nailah.

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:33.416
Why would he stop?

01:34:35.041 --> 01:34:37.083
I believed him.

01:34:38.583 --> 01:34:41.000
And him not loving me...

01:34:41.541 --> 01:34:42.500
I can't deal with that.

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.875
Paula: Nailah, no!

01:34:47.833 --> 01:34:48.833
I won't...

01:34:49.125 --> 01:34:50.125
deal with that.

01:34:52.916 --> 01:34:53.916
(loud bang)

01:34:53.916 --> 01:36:55.333
(music plays)
