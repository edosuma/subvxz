00:02.170 --> 00:03.546
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.713 --> 00:06.758
But you are my only
true blood relative, Oswald.

00:07.258 --> 00:08.968
That vermin has to go.

00:09.135 --> 00:11.388
But, how can we persuade him to go?

00:11.846 --> 00:13.473
How do you get rid of rats?

00:16.267 --> 00:17.936
- Did he, did he drink that?
- Yes.

00:18.103 --> 00:20.188
Why? Why? He's not supposed to.

00:21.106 --> 00:22.607
No!

00:24.484 --> 00:25.735
Awake at last.

00:26.611 --> 00:29.114
Well, hello, dear.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.241
Someone call Professor Strange!

00:31.658 --> 00:33.743
<i>We'll see about your
clever little plan, Jim Gordon.</i>

00:33.910 --> 00:35.954
<i>I can make plans of my own.</i>

00:36.121 --> 00:38.498
- Hello, Officer Pinkney. Can I come in?
- Sure.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.794
Murder weapon was a crowbar.
Your fingerprints were on it.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.170
I was set up!

00:44.629 --> 00:47.006
<i>Being convicted for murder
has its downsides.</i>

00:47.173 --> 00:48.258
It was good to see you, Harv.

00:48.425 --> 00:49.634
Don't give up hope.

00:49.801 --> 00:50.802
What the hell are you doing here?

00:50.969 --> 00:53.096
What's it look like?
We're getting you out of here.

00:53.263 --> 00:54.305
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

00:54.472 --> 00:55.515
I have to clear my name.

00:55.682 --> 00:57.559
<i>And to do that
I have to go to back to Gotham.</i>

01:00.979 --> 01:02.397
You little thugs!

01:03.940 --> 01:05.817
Don't you take that bag!

01:05.984 --> 01:08.570
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

01:11.531 --> 01:12.824
Leave it!

01:27.922 --> 01:29.007
That's my money!

01:29.549 --> 01:33.052
Boo-hoo! You stole it.
Now you got stole, chump.

01:33.303 --> 01:35.472
I catch you, you're dead! Both of you!

01:35.638 --> 01:38.308
By the way, you're a terrible crook,
letting two kids rob you.

01:38.475 --> 01:40.477
You really don't deserve this money.

01:41.311 --> 01:43.354
What the hell are you doing,
you little freak?

01:43.521 --> 01:44.939
What the hell are you doing?

01:45.148 --> 01:49.861
You're both dead!
Nobody's ever gonna touch my money!

01:51.529 --> 01:53.364
I'm not a thief.
I don't steal for the money.

01:53.615 --> 01:54.991
This is research.
I can't understand Gotham,

01:55.158 --> 01:56.326
- until I understand its criminals.
- Okay.

01:56.493 --> 01:59.913
This whole "understanding criminals" thing
is getting on my nerves.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.748
That was your half you threw out.

02:06.044 --> 02:07.796
I saved enough for burgers.

02:08.046 --> 02:09.589
<i>Gotham is on high alert today</i>

02:09.756 --> 02:14.302
<i>after former GCPD detective
and convicted murderer, James Gordon,</i>

02:14.469 --> 02:16.930
<i>escaped from Blackgate Prison last night.</i>

02:17.096 --> 02:18.640
Detective Bullock,
have you heard the news?

02:18.890 --> 02:19.974
Yeah, Ed, I heard.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.309
So what do you think he'll do?

02:21.476 --> 02:23.686
Knowing Jim Gordon,
I'd say he's not gonna rest

02:23.853 --> 02:26.856
until he finds the son-of-a-bitch
who framed him for murder.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.778
Good luck with that.

02:32.028 --> 02:36.783
Bullock. This is your one and
only chance to tell me where he is.

02:37.075 --> 02:39.035
Hand to God, Cap, I have no idea.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.788
Oh, stop it. You're not smart enough
to play dumb.

02:41.955 --> 02:44.582
We both know Jim did not kill Pinkney.

02:44.833 --> 02:46.918
I know that the court found him guilty.

02:47.168 --> 02:50.255
He wants to prove his own innocence,
great, I hope he does.

02:50.463 --> 02:53.550
The public, the people of Gotham,
the ones you and I serve...

02:53.716 --> 02:57.303
They have to know. They have to see
that we're impartial, you understand?

02:57.512 --> 03:00.306
The people of Gotham can eat my socks.

03:01.724 --> 03:05.520
Hey! Hey! Nice try.

03:05.937 --> 03:09.440
Walk away in a huff.
Now I know you know something.

03:09.816 --> 03:12.318
If you're providing aid and shelter
to Jim Gordon,

03:12.485 --> 03:14.612
anything, a glass of water,

03:15.280 --> 03:17.448
I will bust you like a bum I never met.

03:17.615 --> 03:21.286
Cap, I wish I knew where he was,
but I don't.

03:24.581 --> 03:25.665
Go.

03:33.798 --> 03:37.468
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Let's get to work.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.859
I've been going over and over this
a thousand times in my mind.

03:53.026 --> 03:54.611
It all has to be connected.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.947
The theft at the art museum,
the bombing at the train station,

03:58.156 --> 04:00.491
the IA tipoff, Pinkney's murder...

04:02.201 --> 04:04.370
It's all a part of an elaborate frame.

04:04.662 --> 04:09.542
So, he's smart, meticulous,
got technical skill, and access.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.421
- An active cop?
- Has to be.

04:14.005 --> 04:17.508
Only way that he could have access to
a crowbar after it was put into evidence.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.929
That doesn't really narrow
the suspect list too much.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.014
I mean, come on, Jim, be honest,

04:23.181 --> 04:26.684
you probably got 500 cops
who have beef with you.

04:27.018 --> 04:30.396
- Yeah, but enough to frame me for murder?
- Maybe 10.

04:31.356 --> 04:32.607
You got to admit,

04:32.815 --> 04:36.861
you do have a little bit of a knack
for, uh, making enemies.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.489
My number was 12.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.532
- Hmm.
- Mainly Loeb loyalists.

04:41.866 --> 04:43.868
Who knows?
Maybe Loeb himself is behind this.

04:44.035 --> 04:46.037
Before you go down that rabbit hole,

04:46.663 --> 04:48.831
I've gotta say something
to you as a friend.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.751
You can still run.

04:52.377 --> 04:56.381
<i>Go to an island. Buy a banana boat.
Grow a beard. Find Lee. Have a life.</i>

04:56.714 --> 04:58.758
Look, I've been working this thing
since you went away,

04:58.925 --> 05:00.718
and I'm not saying it's hopeless,

05:01.135 --> 05:02.887
but Barnes is on the hunt.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.932
- You don't have much time.
- Did he threaten you?

05:06.099 --> 05:08.434
Hey, I'm the one who busted you
out of jail, remember?

05:08.601 --> 05:10.103
I made my choice.

05:10.395 --> 05:11.938
All right, let's say, I run.

05:12.230 --> 05:15.233
I find Lee. I somehow convince her
to take me back. What then?

05:15.817 --> 05:17.610
I get her to live as a fugitive?

05:19.862 --> 05:23.074
I have to clear my name.
Otherwise, I might as well be in jail.

05:23.825 --> 05:26.411
But how? Starting where?

05:27.495 --> 05:30.373
Dent once told me IA
secretly records and archives

05:30.581 --> 05:32.834
all their incoming calls on tape.

05:33.251 --> 05:37.630
Which means, the eyewitness,
who called into IA,

05:37.880 --> 05:39.799
the one they assumed was Pinkney?

05:40.508 --> 05:42.593
There could be a tape
with his voice on it.

05:43.928 --> 05:45.596
It's a hell of a long shot, brother.

05:45.930 --> 05:51.185
And if... Okay.
Just saying <i>if</i> a tape like that exists,

05:52.103 --> 05:55.398
it's gonna be locked up tighter
than a duck's ass in IA evidence.

05:56.858 --> 06:00.653
That's why it's lucky for you,
Uncle Harvey has connections.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.782
Hey, Ginny.

06:06.284 --> 06:09.704
How's my favorite IA sugar plum, huh?

06:11.164 --> 06:13.166
Well, why do you think I'm calling, baby?

06:14.500 --> 06:17.503
- Heard you're getting married?
- No, she changed her mind.

06:17.670 --> 06:20.131
Smart girl. Oh.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.469
You're an animal, Bullock.
You know that?

06:24.635 --> 06:26.095
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do, I do.

06:26.262 --> 06:27.638
Oh!

06:27.847 --> 06:31.559
- Come on, Bullock.
- Yeah, baby! I'll be right there.

06:31.851 --> 06:33.811
Just hold on for me for a second.

06:37.732 --> 06:40.234
Hey, an hour. Slip 'em under the door.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.987
<i>- Come on, Bullock, I ain't got all night!</i>
- Don't say a word.

06:43.488 --> 06:44.530
Mmm?

06:45.615 --> 06:47.950
<i>Daddy's coming!</i>

07:13.476 --> 07:15.144
<i>- Is that what he said?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

07:17.230 --> 07:18.981
Julian had his arm all twisted up.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.045
<i>Give me that!</i>

07:41.212 --> 07:42.713
Oh, what's up, sweetheart,
what are you doing, huh?

07:42.880 --> 07:45.299
- Where are you going? Give me your purse.
- What, no, no!

07:45.466 --> 07:48.136
- Come on, do it! Just, come on, do it.
- Somebody help!

07:48.386 --> 07:49.512
- Just do it.
- Hey!

07:49.679 --> 07:51.013
No!

07:59.772 --> 08:02.024
Get out of here. Go!

08:04.902 --> 08:06.404
Ma'am, are you okay?

08:09.532 --> 08:12.034
- You're welcome.
<i>- Hands up! Or I'll blow your head off.</i>

08:14.912 --> 08:16.747
GCPD. You're under--

08:17.915 --> 08:19.292
You're Jim Gordon.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.918
Listen to me.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.088
This is Barkley over on Fifth and Spring.
I got Jim--

08:26.340 --> 08:28.384
- Don't kill me!
- I'm innocent, you hear me?

08:31.929 --> 08:34.849
All units, it's Jim freaking Gordon!
I need backup now!

08:52.450 --> 08:54.327
Father, I only knew you a short time.

08:56.871 --> 09:01.083
But you came to me
when I was alone in this cold, dark world.

09:04.128 --> 09:05.796
You gave me a family.

09:09.342 --> 09:13.930
I will never forget you as long as I live.

09:17.350 --> 09:19.185
<i>Oh, Father.</i>

09:27.902 --> 09:30.071
What a bore that was.

09:30.238 --> 09:32.281
Yeah, but the house is ours now,
and we're rich.

09:32.448 --> 09:33.616
Quiet.

09:34.158 --> 09:35.660
Oh.

09:37.078 --> 09:40.498
- He loved us all so much.
- Indeed.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.625
But, Oswald, Oswald...

09:42.792 --> 09:46.212
As painful as this is,
we need to talk practicalities. Um...

09:46.629 --> 09:49.340
Can I call you a cab,
or will you take the bus?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.467
I don't understand.

09:51.968 --> 09:53.761
Well, you're not returning
to the house with us.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.932
- But where shall I go?
- Anywhere, but there.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.393
Oswald, I'm so happy that you
and your father reconnected,

10:00.559 --> 10:04.188
but he left the house
and the estate to me, and I'm...

10:04.522 --> 10:06.565
Well, I'm simply not comfortable sleeping
under the same roof

10:06.732 --> 10:08.234
as a notorious murderer.

10:08.526 --> 10:10.361
But I'm not like that anymore.

10:11.279 --> 10:13.739
I couldn't hurt a fly,
even if I wanted to.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.867
Please, my father was all that I had.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.703
We shared the same blood, and--

10:18.911 --> 10:21.706
And he wanted us to be together.
He told me.

10:22.498 --> 10:24.709
Let me stay. I'll do anything.

10:30.006 --> 10:34.176
You are his blood.
We do need help around the house.

10:34.385 --> 10:35.386
- Mother.
- Mother.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.597
Why waste good money on servants
when we have Oswald?

10:38.764 --> 10:40.349
I'll do anything.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.893
Well, you can start by getting rid
of those disgusting flowers.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.981
- I've always detested lilies.
- Yes, of course.

10:49.734 --> 10:51.360
You're not really letting him stay?

10:51.569 --> 10:53.779
He's Elijah's only natural son.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.824
If he found the right lawyer,
he could make things difficult.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.993
Especially if people look into
how his father died.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.703
So, we just live with him, then?

11:00.911 --> 11:04.206
Yeah, we keep him close and
after a suitable amount of time goes by,

11:04.373 --> 11:07.835
poor Oswald, overcome with grief,
will take his own life.

11:08.002 --> 11:12.214
Till then, we have a free servant.
I can fire the maid.

11:17.428 --> 11:22.224
I murdered my parents.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.061
I cut their throats.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.104
Um...

11:27.772 --> 11:30.232
<i>I joined a gang of psychopathic killers.</i>

11:32.651 --> 11:36.822
I tried to kill Jim Gordon
and Lee Thompkins.

11:37.573 --> 11:41.577
I was a puppet
of these demons in my head

11:41.744 --> 11:45.206
and, uh, they were forcing me
to do these terrible things.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.628
<i>I wish I could go back
and undo what I've done.</i>

11:51.629 --> 11:52.963
<i>Only I can't.</i>

11:55.132 --> 11:59.804
I don't feel insane, now.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.808
I just...

12:05.226 --> 12:07.186
I feel sad.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.273
Thank you, Barbara.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.818
That was very brave.

12:15.319 --> 12:19.698
What do you suppose
made this healthful change in you?

12:21.867 --> 12:26.205
Maybe I just really needed some sleep.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.341
It's a good act.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.511
<i>You're so sure it's an act, are you?</i>

12:40.719 --> 12:43.931
- Aren't you?
- I have no idea.

12:44.807 --> 12:48.227
One way or the other, she intrigues me.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.272
Well, if you would allow us to apply
rigorous dream therapy,

12:51.480 --> 12:52.773
we would know for sure.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.191
No, no, no.

12:54.608 --> 12:59.029
<i>We do have a very useful hammer,
Ms. Peabody,</i>

12:59.447 --> 13:03.242
but not all of our patients are nails.

13:21.427 --> 13:22.761
Thank you.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.972
- What the hell happened last night?
- Ah...

13:26.140 --> 13:27.766
Stumbled on to a mugging.

13:28.476 --> 13:31.228
And Jim Gordon couldn't just walk by.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.355
<i>Where'd you sleep?</i>

13:33.564 --> 13:36.817
I didn't. I just walked around.
How's Barnes?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.652
He's on the warpath.

13:38.903 --> 13:43.032
Governor announced a $10,000 reward
for anyone who helps catch you.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.326
$10,000. You should turn me in.

13:45.618 --> 13:48.579
If he doubled it to 20,
I'd give it some thought.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.080
Okay, here.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.290
<i>Internal Affairs.</i>

13:51.457 --> 13:54.960
<i>I--</i>
<i>I want to report a crime.</i>

13:55.961 --> 13:58.881
- You recognize that voice?
- Sounds like it's been disguised.

13:59.924 --> 14:04.428
<i>I saw Detective James Gordon
shooting Mayor Theo Galavan</i>

14:04.595 --> 14:05.930
<i>on the Southside Docks.</i>

14:06.096 --> 14:10.476
<i>The Penguin was beating him with a bat,
but it was Gordon that pulled the trigger.</i>

14:13.312 --> 14:14.438
Is that a bird?

14:15.689 --> 14:16.857
Run it back.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.363
Yeah.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.824
We gotta find somebody
to clean up the tape.

14:26.075 --> 14:29.453
Isolate the sound.
Maybe do something to the voice.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.375
I gotta get going.
Barnes is watching me like a hawk.

14:34.542 --> 14:35.751
Yeah. All right.

14:36.252 --> 14:37.336
Hey.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.421
You've done more than
any partner could ask.

14:39.672 --> 14:41.882
From now on, stay away from me.

14:42.174 --> 14:45.427
For your own sake. If Loeb is behind this,
you don't wanna be mixed up in it.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.221
What're you gonna do?

14:49.139 --> 14:51.642
I still have some friends
I could ask for help.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.979
Where're you going? Jim!

15:04.697 --> 15:05.990
Hi, Ed.

15:12.246 --> 15:15.165
- Please. Please, don't hurt me.
- No, relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.001
- I need your help.
- My help?

15:17.209 --> 15:18.919
I didn't kill Pinkney.
You have to believe me.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.921
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.798
I need to find the man who framed me.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.175
Whoever it was,
he covered his tracks well.

15:25.509 --> 15:26.802
But I have something.

15:28.178 --> 15:33.058
A recording of his first call to IA.
IA secretly records everyone who calls in.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.394
They do?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.689
Those sneaky little buggers.

15:39.940 --> 15:44.194
Uh, and what did-- What did you hear?
If you don't mind my asking.

15:44.361 --> 15:48.449
Not much. He disguised his voice.
But there are other sounds on the tape.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.661
I figured, you work with audio.
I was hoping you could help me.

15:54.038 --> 15:55.080
Jim.

15:56.290 --> 15:59.209
My friend, you've come to the right place.

16:01.462 --> 16:02.921
Please, have a seat.

16:09.261 --> 16:12.973
I will get my stuff and make some tea.

16:22.441 --> 16:23.442
Mmm.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.660
Well, let's pray Helga hasn't signed on
anywhere new yet.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.579
It's a family recipe.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.581
I'm sorry you don't like it.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.584
<i>I'm sure my cooking
will improve over time.</i>

16:41.043 --> 16:42.920
Mmm, it's not that bad.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.302
Tomorrow, you need to go
to the butcher.

16:50.469 --> 16:56.600
I'd like a nice roast for Sunday dinner.
Not your slut mother's goulash.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.604
A nice roast. Yes, ma'am.

17:01.647 --> 17:05.776
Oh, and clean up this mess tonight.
I can't stand the sight of dirty dishes.

17:17.913 --> 17:18.997
Oops.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.297
Oops.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.052
Good shot, Charles.

17:35.347 --> 17:38.809
Okay. I must get to these dishes.

17:39.268 --> 17:42.646
But, this has been delightful. Really.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.525
Yes, it does sound like a bird.

17:47.943 --> 17:52.281
And he's doing his best to mask his voice.
It's too bad the quality's so poor.

17:52.489 --> 17:53.824
Uh...

17:54.283 --> 17:57.077
Well, I'm afraid it's a dead end.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.079
We should at least clean the tape.

17:59.830 --> 18:00.914
Right.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.092
You need some more tea.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.766
So, the person who killed Pinkney
and framed you,

18:19.183 --> 18:22.186
is the same person
that attacked the art museum

18:22.394 --> 18:24.855
and planted the bomb in the train station.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.525
Amazing. And you don't have any leads?

18:30.194 --> 18:33.280
I think Loeb was behind it.
Payback.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.409
He still has lackeys in the GCPD.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.038
- Is that so?
- Everything points to a cop.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.624
Or someone who worked
with the police, had access.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.878
You all right, Ed?

18:49.004 --> 18:51.548
Right as rain. Just thinking.

18:52.382 --> 18:55.761
Surely, you don't think
that Loeb killed Pinkney himself?

18:56.011 --> 18:59.389
No. He had some psychopath do it for him.

19:02.434 --> 19:04.228
"Psychopath" seems a strong word.

19:05.938 --> 19:09.316
He bludgeoned a man to death
with a crowbar in cold blood.

19:09.775 --> 19:10.901
He's sick.

19:11.276 --> 19:15.113
You say that, yet, you've killed
lots of people, haven't you?

19:17.449 --> 19:19.243
That was in the line of duty.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.581
And a person who would kill
in cold blood is a psychopath.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.254
See, I-- I knew the rumors weren't true.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.092
What rumors?

19:35.592 --> 19:37.010
About you killing Galavan.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.430
You would never do that.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.184
<i>That would make you
like the people that you're hunting.</i>

19:44.601 --> 19:47.855
<i>Sick. Diseased.</i>

19:50.440 --> 19:51.692
Thar she blows.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.112
Shut up, you're talking too much.

19:55.279 --> 19:59.116
Ed, did Penguin ever say
anything about that night?

19:59.283 --> 20:00.325
Hmm?

20:00.534 --> 20:04.121
Did Penguin ever tell you anything
about the night that Galavan died?

20:04.329 --> 20:06.456
No. Remember?
I nipped that friendship in the bud.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.960
And you didn't talk to him in the GCPD?
When Barnes brought him in?

20:10.252 --> 20:13.422
Yes. No. I-- Just to say hi.

20:13.672 --> 20:16.091
Oh, tape's finished.
I'm gonna give that a listen.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.344
Let's both listen.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.555
Swell idea.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.818
<i>Internal Affairs.</i>

20:34.985 --> 20:38.614
<i>I--</i>
<i>I want to report a crime.</i>

20:39.197 --> 20:43.827
<i>I saw Detective James Gordon
shooting Mayor Theo Galavan</i>

20:43.994 --> 20:45.287
<i>on the Southside Docks.</i>

20:45.454 --> 20:50.042
<i>The Penguin was beating him with a bat,
but it was Gordon that pulled the trigger.</i>

20:57.341 --> 20:58.675
It's not a bird.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.970
It was mechanical.

21:04.514 --> 21:05.599
Without fingers I point,

21:05.766 --> 21:08.936
without arms I strike,
without feet I run. What am I?

21:12.189 --> 21:14.024
- You're a clock.
- Correct.

21:15.943 --> 21:17.527
I know it was you, Ed.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.405
- Me?
- You.

21:33.460 --> 21:38.799
Guess what?
I knew that you knew, that I knew.

21:51.853 --> 21:54.606
That's why your chair's
wired to the mains.

22:04.908 --> 22:08.161
<i>Over the pavement and down the alley</i>

22:08.912 --> 22:11.748
<i>But why this wind is cold</i>

22:12.249 --> 22:17.587
<i>It bites my toes and nips my nose,
as over the ground that we go</i>

22:22.134 --> 22:24.177
I hope you like the outdoors, Jimbo.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.264
I know just the spot.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.154
Come out, come out wherever you are.

22:44.698 --> 22:48.618
I bet you're wondering,
"Why would Ed do this to me?

22:52.039 --> 22:53.290
"Set me up.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.461
"Ruin my life."

23:01.256 --> 23:03.091
I'll give you a hint, Jimbo.

23:04.760 --> 23:05.927
K.K.

23:07.179 --> 23:08.305
Kristen Kringle.

23:29.826 --> 23:30.994
<i>Rats.</i>

23:33.580 --> 23:36.041
<i>Hey, have you seen my jacket?</i>

23:38.335 --> 23:39.920
It's freezing outside.

23:40.504 --> 23:44.466
Sorry. I was fixing the sleeve.
You'd ripped it.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.385
You know how to sew?

23:47.761 --> 23:50.097
Alfred says it's an important skill
for young bachelors.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.391
Okay.

23:58.772 --> 23:59.773
Hmm.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.319
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.372
- What the--
- Detective Gordon.

24:17.707 --> 24:20.460
Bruce? What are you doing here?

24:20.627 --> 24:22.129
I could ask the same about you.

24:22.546 --> 24:24.548
I found the man who framed me.

24:26.591 --> 24:27.843
I need a phone--

24:31.638 --> 24:34.057
Great, a dead cop in my crib now.

24:39.563 --> 24:41.189
<i>Don't forget the cherries, Oswald.</i>

24:41.731 --> 24:45.235
Oh. Right, cherries,
cherries, cherries, cherries.

24:57.664 --> 24:58.915
<i>Oswald!</i>

25:04.337 --> 25:05.547
Oswald.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.966
My drink?

25:11.052 --> 25:12.721
I'm sorry. There's no cherries.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.472
No cherries?

25:15.265 --> 25:18.894
The next time I ask for cherries,
there better be cherries.

25:21.104 --> 25:24.107
Yes, Grace. Ma'am. Of course.

26:05.941 --> 26:08.818
Mother said to remind you
of tomorrow's dinner.

26:10.612 --> 26:13.156
- What's wrong with him?
- Who knows?

26:13.657 --> 26:17.160
- Mother wants a roast.
- And make it good this time.

26:21.498 --> 26:22.832
Yes, I will.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.864
<i>He's still sleeping.</i>

26:55.365 --> 26:56.700
Best thing for him.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.705
Thank you for coming
when I called, Alfred.

27:01.955 --> 27:04.207
Of course I came. No question.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.839
You're looking thin.

27:12.215 --> 27:15.427
- I'm getting plenty to eat.
- That I very much doubt, Master Bruce.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.972
But there are things that we must discuss.

27:19.597 --> 27:20.890
- I'm not coming back.
- I understand that--

27:21.057 --> 27:22.100
- Not yet.
- But we need to talk--

27:22.267 --> 27:23.476
- Alfred!
<i>- Good morning.</i>

27:25.061 --> 27:26.730
Detective Gordon, should you be up?

27:27.063 --> 27:30.233
- I'm fine. You stitched me up?
- Actually, it was Master Bruce.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.736
He called from Selina Kyle's
when you passed out.

27:32.902 --> 27:35.196
So I thought I'd bring you here.
Safest place for you.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.740
Master Bruce,
I'm wondering if you might go

27:36.906 --> 27:40.243
and get the detective his clothes
from the laundry room, please.

27:43.246 --> 27:44.414
I'm glad you're okay.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.419
<i>So, I'll make you some breakfast.
Take a seat.</i>

27:49.627 --> 27:51.963
- Like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

27:54.424 --> 27:56.051
There we go.

28:04.601 --> 28:07.437
How long has Bruce
been living with Selina Kyle?

28:07.645 --> 28:10.231
Ever since the Matches Malone debacle.

28:10.398 --> 28:12.734
Turns out staring into the
cold, dead eyes of the man

28:12.901 --> 28:16.654
that killed your parents
doesn't bring the right amount of closure.

28:16.946 --> 28:20.492
Bruce never should've been in that room.
I should've gotten to Malone first.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.285
Yes. You should've done.

28:23.995 --> 28:25.455
But you didn't, did you?

28:26.956 --> 28:27.957
Eh?

28:29.918 --> 28:34.714
You can't un-fry an egg.
As my dear old mum used to say.

28:34.964 --> 28:38.718
So, why don't we leave
Master Bruce's situation alone,

28:38.968 --> 28:41.388
and why don't we discuss yours, eh?

28:42.806 --> 28:44.474
It's a long story.

28:45.141 --> 28:47.727
Right, so you were framed for the murder
of that other police officer.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.354
You escaped from the prison,

28:49.521 --> 28:51.773
you then tracked down
the man that framed you,

28:51.940 --> 28:53.274
and you're promptly shot in the leg.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.860
Right, so, answer me this, Detective.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.697
Do you have any idea

29:00.657 --> 29:03.451
how you're gonna get out
of this awful pickle?

29:05.328 --> 29:06.663
Yes, I do.

29:07.414 --> 29:09.999
Come, my dear.
Your future awaits.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.251
You're sure?

29:12.585 --> 29:16.005
I run a hospital, not a prison.
You're sane.

29:16.172 --> 29:19.092
It would be unethical and illegal
to keep you confined.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.094
- What if I--
- Hush, now.

29:21.428 --> 29:22.929
Life is full of uncertainty.

29:23.096 --> 29:26.266
And if something does happen,
we're always here.

29:27.517 --> 29:28.685
Off you go.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.568
If you keep releasing lunatics
so liberally,

29:36.734 --> 29:38.820
you're going to get a bad reputation.

29:38.987 --> 29:41.030
I'm not looking for a good reputation.

29:41.364 --> 29:44.409
<i>We're releasing Barbara Kean into the wild
to observe her behavior.</i>

29:44.576 --> 29:46.578
<i>- She's a beautiful experiment.</i>
<i>- Hmm.</i>

29:47.412 --> 29:49.998
You know what she's going to do,
don't you?

29:50.748 --> 29:52.083
I don't, actually.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.545
But I do know it will be interesting.

29:58.339 --> 29:59.883
Nygma was right about one thing.

30:00.425 --> 30:03.052
I can't just go to the cops.
They'll never believe me.

30:03.261 --> 30:06.514
- I need hard proof.
- Cops, right? Jerks.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.602
Nygma said he met Penguin
for the first time in the woods.

30:10.810 --> 30:13.480
<i>That's right around the same time
his girlfriend went missing.</i>

30:13.730 --> 30:16.941
I think he was burying her.
Just like he was going to bury me.

30:17.901 --> 30:19.527
<i>What? You wanna find her body?</i>

30:20.195 --> 30:22.280
Touch of the old "needle
in the haystack," isn't it?

30:22.989 --> 30:24.324
Nygma knows where she is.

30:24.616 --> 30:26.409
What? You think he's gonna, what?
Straight tell you?

30:26.743 --> 30:29.204
That's exactly what he's gonna do.
But I need help.

30:29.537 --> 30:30.914
Whatever we can do.

30:32.207 --> 30:35.460
Thanks. But I need someone
Barnes knows will betray me.

30:42.926 --> 30:44.052
What?

30:46.679 --> 30:49.599
Who do I talk to about the reward
for Jim Gordon?

30:50.099 --> 30:52.227
Hey! Psst. Come here. Come here.

30:52.602 --> 30:54.979
- Come here. Come here.
- Let go of me! I'm here for my reward.

30:55.230 --> 30:57.273
- I'll give you a reward.
<i>- Bullock!</i>

30:58.608 --> 31:02.320
- Have you seen Jim Gordon?
- Depends. There really a ten grand?

31:02.820 --> 31:04.614
Depends on your information.

31:04.822 --> 31:07.617
He was at my place a couple of hours ago.
He'd been shot.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.494
Shot? Who shot him?

31:09.661 --> 31:11.829
<i>Didn't say.
He wasn't making a lot of sense.</i>

31:11.996 --> 31:14.165
- Is he still there now?
- No, he took off.

31:14.332 --> 31:15.416
I don't know where,

31:15.583 --> 31:17.961
but he was just looking for a place
to lie low for a while, I guess.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.088
That's not worth $10,000.

31:20.964 --> 31:22.507
Fine.

31:23.049 --> 31:25.843
Before he left he said he'd found out
where the Penguin was hiding

31:26.010 --> 31:27.262
<i>and he was gonna go see him.</i>

31:27.470 --> 31:28.763
<i>Why would he go see the Penguin?</i>

31:28.930 --> 31:31.599
I don't know. Something about,
"Penguin knows where the body is buried."

31:31.766 --> 31:33.393
- What bodies?
- I don't know!

31:33.560 --> 31:35.812
- Where's the Penguin now?
- No one knows.

31:36.437 --> 31:39.482
- You're gonna pay me or what?
- Or what?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.827
Relax. Relax.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.123
Maybe Gordon won't even find Penguin.

31:56.291 --> 32:00.169
You idiot. He's a detective.
He finds people for a living.

32:02.672 --> 32:05.091
Penguin won't tell him.
He's my friend.

32:06.843 --> 32:11.347
Who am I kidding?
You idiot. Stupid. Stupid!

32:11.973 --> 32:15.476
Okay, okay.
Okay, calculate, cal-- Calculate.

32:16.227 --> 32:19.897
Chances of Gordon finding Penguin,
let's say 80%.

32:21.024 --> 32:23.735
Chances of Penguin telling Gordon,
also 80%.

32:24.193 --> 32:27.447
So that's a 60% chance
of Gordon finding Kristen.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.534
That settles it.

32:54.432 --> 32:55.975
Hello, Kristen.

32:57.101 --> 33:00.063
I know, didn't expect to see me again,

33:00.980 --> 33:03.650
but circumstances.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.489
Now, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move you.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.285
Now--

33:21.084 --> 33:24.879
Jim Gordon.
So you did find Penguin.

33:25.755 --> 33:27.173
And that little bird sang.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.467
No, I just followed you.

33:35.515 --> 33:38.935
You fed information to that little
miscreant assuming that I'd hear.

33:39.227 --> 33:42.605
Or no. No, no, no.
Of course, you were in cahoots.

33:42.897 --> 33:43.898
Of course, you were in cahoots.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.234
Well, either way, bravo, Jim.

33:46.651 --> 33:49.278
I'd clap, but I have your gun in my hand.

33:49.654 --> 33:51.280
How did this happen to you?

33:52.782 --> 33:54.659
How did you become this?

33:55.827 --> 33:59.163
You dummy, this is who I am.

34:00.373 --> 34:03.084
It was just finally admitting
the truth to myself.

34:03.751 --> 34:05.545
Well, that and murdering some people.

34:06.295 --> 34:09.382
- I don't believe that.
- You don't believe it. Why, Jim?

34:10.133 --> 34:12.135
'Cause it would make you incompetent?

34:12.343 --> 34:14.637
To know that I was right
under your nose the whole time?

34:14.804 --> 34:16.931
Or you don't wanna admit
that there's a monster in all of us,

34:17.098 --> 34:19.434
because you, of all people,
should know that.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.396
That's what made it so easy to frame you.

34:24.647 --> 34:25.815
I was your friend.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.609
Were you, Jim?
Were you my friend?

34:29.861 --> 34:32.488
Or did you just pity me?
"Oh, poor, weird, little Ed.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.909
"With his little, silly wordplay
and his little riddles."

34:37.535 --> 34:39.203
You're completely insane.

34:39.495 --> 34:42.331
Yeah. It's probably easier
for you to think that.

34:44.667 --> 34:48.212
How about one last riddle
for old time's sake?

34:50.548 --> 34:52.425
"A nightmare for some.

34:53.217 --> 34:56.429
"For others, a savior, I come.

34:57.388 --> 34:59.432
"My hands, cold and bleak,

35:00.641 --> 35:03.144
"it's the warm hearts they seek."

35:05.021 --> 35:06.105
Death.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.025
Right again.

35:11.319 --> 35:12.528
Goodbye, Jim.

35:12.737 --> 35:14.363
<i>Drop the gun!</i>

35:14.614 --> 35:16.032
Drop it!

35:17.116 --> 35:19.869
Captain Barnes, I'm arresting Jim.

35:20.161 --> 35:23.998
Stop it, Ed. We heard everything!
Now, drop the gun and get on your knees!

35:24.165 --> 35:27.043
No, this is-- This-- I'm-- He's-- He's--

35:27.376 --> 35:28.753
Last chance!

35:42.099 --> 35:43.267
Oh, crud.

35:59.075 --> 36:01.244
How is it? Not too gamey?

36:01.452 --> 36:03.412
Hmm. Overcooked.

36:05.498 --> 36:06.916
Try the other joint.

36:09.252 --> 36:11.254
It is much more tender.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.176
Hmm. It's the same.

36:17.426 --> 36:18.427
Mmm.

36:19.178 --> 36:23.099
Still, beats my slut mother's goulash, no?

36:24.934 --> 36:27.270
Where are the children?
Ring the bell again.

36:27.770 --> 36:30.106
Hmm. I doubt they'll hear it.

36:32.608 --> 36:33.651
You look different.

36:33.985 --> 36:35.820
You noticed!

36:38.281 --> 36:40.908
Yes. I'm doing my hair a different way.

36:41.951 --> 36:45.997
Charles! Sasha! Where are they?

36:47.415 --> 36:49.876
I found the sherry decanter, Grace.

36:51.961 --> 36:54.881
The one with poison in it
that you used to kill my father.

36:58.009 --> 37:00.011
What on Earth are you talking about?

37:00.469 --> 37:02.513
You should've thrown it away.

37:02.805 --> 37:06.559
Guess you're a little too mean
to waste good poison, huh?

37:09.437 --> 37:10.730
Don't go.

37:10.897 --> 37:13.024
Charles! Sasha! Help!

37:13.190 --> 37:15.651
- They won't come.
- Where are they?

37:16.986 --> 37:19.447
You thought they tasted the same.

37:20.031 --> 37:21.657
But Sasha--

37:23.534 --> 37:24.535
Mmm.

37:25.745 --> 37:28.164
- No. No. No.
- Definitely more tender.

37:28.331 --> 37:29.665
- No!
- In my opinion.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.543
No! No!

37:33.586 --> 37:35.838
<i>You said you were innocent.
And you were.</i>

37:37.006 --> 37:38.257
I'm glad.

37:39.175 --> 37:40.676
I guess I owe you an apology.

37:40.885 --> 37:44.263
No. You were doing your duty.
Can't fault you for that.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.516
Ah, well, I owe you one.

37:48.184 --> 37:50.186
Not necessary. But I'll take it.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.189
Can you do me a favor,

37:54.357 --> 37:56.150
and take it easy on Bullock?

37:57.360 --> 37:59.236
Thanks.

37:59.612 --> 38:02.698
So, when are you coming back to work?

38:04.367 --> 38:08.162
- I'm not coming back. Not yet, anyhow.
- No?

38:08.704 --> 38:10.998
There's something I have to do first.

38:21.550 --> 38:22.885
Lee Thompkins' number.

38:23.594 --> 38:26.389
She's working for
an M.E. Department down south.

38:31.227 --> 38:34.021
I promised Bruce Wayne
I'd solve his parents' murder.

38:34.689 --> 38:36.399
<i>I have to do that first.</i>

38:37.108 --> 38:38.609
Then, I'm free.

38:41.070 --> 38:44.281
The Wayne case is closed, Jim.
The perp is dead.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.742
But who hired him? Why?
I need to find out.

38:46.909 --> 38:49.745
Sometimes we never find out.
It happens.

38:51.247 --> 38:53.499
I need you to give me the Wayne files.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.837
You take this
and I'll give you the Wayne files.

39:02.425 --> 39:03.509
Call her.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.887
<i>I'll go get 'em.</i>

39:17.273 --> 39:19.984
It was nothing that you did
or didn't do, Alfred.

39:20.693 --> 39:23.362
Why I went away.
I want you to know that.

39:23.988 --> 39:25.239
I do.

39:26.073 --> 39:27.616
Thank you very much.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.660
I'll be going back to the city
as soon as Selina's ready.

39:29.827 --> 39:31.954
She's just taking a hot shower.

39:32.455 --> 39:33.456
Hmm.

39:36.584 --> 39:39.837
You do know that Mr. Lucius Fox
fixed your old man's computer

39:40.004 --> 39:41.422
a couple of days ago, don't you?

39:41.630 --> 39:42.923
And when were you going
to tell me, Alfred?

39:43.090 --> 39:46.802
Well, I tried telling you this morning.
I'm telling you again now, aren't I?

39:47.803 --> 39:49.805
- Don't--
- What're you doing?

39:50.473 --> 39:52.641
She could walk in here.
Have a word.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.478
- I trust her.
- It's about trust, is it?

39:55.853 --> 39:58.898
Look, whatever your father was doing,
he did it in secret for a reason.

39:59.065 --> 40:00.858
To protect those he loved.
And it's got--

40:01.025 --> 40:03.319
It doesn't matter about
my personal opinion about that young girl.

40:03.486 --> 40:05.988
But she has been a bloody good friend
to you and she's been loyal.

40:06.155 --> 40:07.782
So, I'm gonna let you go ahead.

40:07.990 --> 40:10.451
Continue your father's work.
I can't stop you.

40:10.618 --> 40:12.328
I mean I've tried, haven't I?

40:12.536 --> 40:16.624
But I will not have you put that
little girl's life in danger.

40:17.917 --> 40:20.169
It's either the work or it's her.

40:20.795 --> 40:22.838
Can't have both. Do you understand?

40:23.506 --> 40:26.509
Ugh! Man, rich people
have great water pressure.

40:28.052 --> 40:32.223
So, Jeeves, any chance
we can get a ride back to the city?

40:33.724 --> 40:38.062
Right, well, I'll be in the...
In the kitchen, Master Bruce.

40:40.106 --> 40:41.190
Miss.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.488
What's with him?

40:52.409 --> 40:54.078
Bruce, what's going on?

40:58.707 --> 41:00.084
I'm not going back.

41:00.751 --> 41:01.877
What?

41:03.879 --> 41:06.549
I'm grateful for everything
that you taught me.

41:08.175 --> 41:09.552
My place is here.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.974
So, that's it?

41:19.562 --> 41:20.563
Wow.

41:21.272 --> 41:22.314
I don't expect you to understand.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.441
Right, 'cause you're Bruce Wayne
and I'm street trash.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.777
- Selina, it's not like that.
- Yeah, it is.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.447
It is.

41:32.533 --> 41:33.868
It's fine.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.620
Have a great life, Bruce Wayne.
