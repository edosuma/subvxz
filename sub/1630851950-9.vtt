00:12.137 --> 00:15.241
I'm not like some
75-year-old orange dude.

00:15.241 --> 00:17.137
- Previously
on The Oval...

00:17.137 --> 00:18.482
You have a gun?

00:18.482 --> 00:19.655
Yes, sir.

00:19.655 --> 00:22.137
- I bet that I can make you
give it to me.

00:22.137 --> 00:25.862
- Just go and take a bullet
to that bitch's head,

00:25.862 --> 00:28.034
and all your pain will stop.

00:28.034 --> 00:29.862
Honey, I'm home.

00:29.862 --> 00:32.310
Donald, I'm tired.

00:32.310 --> 00:36.068
- I'm tired of your lies,
I'm tired of your bullshit.

00:54.586 --> 00:55.655
Hello?

00:55.655 --> 00:57.517
- What the hell is taking
you so long?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.862
Are you watching me?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.827
- Yes.
I want to see it.

01:03.827 --> 01:05.103
How?

01:05.103 --> 01:07.931
Don't worry about it.

01:07.931 --> 01:09.379
I can't do it.

01:09.379 --> 01:11.965
- She's in the White House,
- - my husband,

01:11.965 --> 01:13.931
and you can't do it?

01:13.931 --> 01:15.827
I can't do it.

01:15.827 --> 01:18.172
- Okay.
Look outside.

01:18.172 --> 01:19.896
Look at the car
across the street.

01:19.896 --> 01:22.793
- Ma'am, please.
- How's your mother?

01:22.793 --> 01:24.103
What?

01:24.103 --> 01:26.241
How's your mother?

01:26.241 --> 01:27.931
She's fine.

01:27.931 --> 01:29.517
Are you sure?

01:29.517 --> 01:31.103
- Where the hell
is my mother?

01:31.103 --> 01:34.344
- No, no,
look at your phone.

01:36.103 --> 01:39.275
- ALLEN'S MOM: Allen...
Allen, please, please!

01:39.275 --> 01:42.551
- You see it?
- I will -- kill you.

01:42.551 --> 01:46.172
- You don't have to,
just kill her.

01:46.172 --> 01:48.172
Where is my mother?

01:48.172 --> 01:49.827
You do what I ask you to do,

01:49.827 --> 01:51.689
and she'll be fine
at home,

01:51.689 --> 01:54.103
baking your favorite
Italian dish.

01:54.103 --> 01:56.862
- Why can't you get that
guy to do it, alright?

01:56.862 --> 01:58.275
He's already beating me.

01:58.275 --> 02:02.172
- Shit, what fun would
that be?

02:02.172 --> 02:06.103
I'm an evil bitch,
not a pleasant one.

02:06.103 --> 02:07.931
I want to have fun.

02:07.931 --> 02:10.310
- I can go to jail.
- You won't.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.896
Trust me, ain't nobody
gonna miss that bitch.

02:12.896 --> 02:14.413
- I'm begging you--

02:14.413 --> 02:18.241
- Just crack her -- skull.
One good hit.

02:18.241 --> 02:21.758
Come on,
make a lady happy.

02:21.758 --> 02:23.586
She's coming back.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.793
- Can you stop staring
at me and go somewhere?

02:44.344 --> 02:47.000
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the president and first lady.

03:13.137 --> 03:14.965
What's wrong with you?

03:21.965 --> 03:23.965
You're standing there like
there's something

03:23.965 --> 03:26.379
you want to say to me, is there
something you wanna say?

03:26.379 --> 03:28.310
Go back to sleep.

03:28.310 --> 03:30.862
- Well, I was trying,
but...

03:32.655 --> 03:33.758
What is it?

03:33.758 --> 03:38.000
- Please, go back
to sleep, okay?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.862
- No.
Allen, what?

03:41.862 --> 03:43.620
Ellie...

03:43.620 --> 03:46.068
- Just tell me what it is,
what?

03:46.068 --> 03:48.620
- Go to sleep.
Please!

03:48.620 --> 03:53.379
- Damn it! Go to bed!
- God...

03:53.379 --> 03:56.310
Look, okay, we just...

03:58.793 --> 04:00.482
Allen, fine, let's just talk
about this,

04:00.482 --> 04:02.862
okay, look, you know...

04:02.862 --> 04:05.793
you know that I was
sleeping with him.

04:05.793 --> 04:08.137
You know it.

04:08.137 --> 04:12.310
What I don't know is why you
would still stay here.

04:12.310 --> 04:14.206
Why are you even here?

04:14.206 --> 04:17.137
- Damn it, please,
just go to sleep!

04:17.137 --> 04:18.758
Okay? Go to bed!

04:18.758 --> 04:20.896
- Okay, just let me
get this out.

04:23.689 --> 04:26.551
I told him it was over.

04:26.551 --> 04:33.275
And if it's not about work
just do not speak to me.

04:33.275 --> 04:36.655
And he got really
pissed off.

04:36.655 --> 04:38.000
No.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.965
- But I don't care,
he can fire me Allen,

04:39.965 --> 04:41.482
I don't care anymore.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.655
No. You're lying.

04:44.655 --> 04:49.275
- I'm not lying.
It's over.

04:49.275 --> 04:54.310
I told him it's over, and he
kept saying that it's not.

04:54.310 --> 04:56.482
You have to believe me.

04:59.206 --> 05:02.551
I'm in love, Allen,
and I don't--

05:02.551 --> 05:06.034
Wait. Wait wait.

05:06.034 --> 05:09.620
You're in love?

05:09.620 --> 05:12.413
You're in love with who?

05:12.413 --> 05:15.000
- You!
Asshole.

05:20.896 --> 05:24.103
- Look, what are you
saying, Ellie?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
You, Allen.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.103
And I know we're a mess.

05:33.103 --> 05:34.793
No.

05:34.793 --> 05:40.655
- Allen, I was wrong.
I was wrong.

05:40.655 --> 05:43.689
You didn't deserve what
I did to you.

05:43.689 --> 05:48.310
What I put you through.

05:48.310 --> 05:51.448
I'm ashamed.

05:51.448 --> 05:54.862
And I feel stupid.

05:54.862 --> 05:57.551
So stupid.

05:57.551 --> 05:59.931
Because you were right.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.758
He was using me
and I let him.

06:07.310 --> 06:10.241
I let him use me
just to hurt you.

06:10.241 --> 06:15.793
- No, no, come on.
Don't say this to me now, Ellie.

06:15.793 --> 06:21.793
- That's why I can't
look at you, Allen.

06:21.793 --> 06:23.689
That's why
I wanted you to leave,

06:23.689 --> 06:26.931
it's not because I hate you.

06:26.931 --> 06:29.103
I just...

06:29.103 --> 06:32.241
I just thought maybe if
I had just one night,

06:32.241 --> 06:34.137
I could think about it,
I could figure it out,

06:34.137 --> 06:36.448
and figure out how
I'll ever make it up to you.

06:36.448 --> 06:39.586
- No, come on. No, no!
- Hear me.

06:39.586 --> 06:42.517
No, please.

06:47.137 --> 06:49.068
I love you.

06:50.586 --> 06:52.862
I love you.

07:04.344 --> 07:05.758
Yeah?

07:05.758 --> 07:08.551
- Max, we're dropping you
at the Washington Grand Hotel.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.206
Okay.

07:10.206 --> 07:11.689
Room key in your pocket.

07:13.413 --> 07:14.758
Okay.

07:14.758 --> 07:17.137
- Now, I want you and Bobby
to stay there and lay low.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.413
You'll be safe.

07:18.413 --> 07:21.620
That hotel is owned by an ally
and one of our donors.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.551
Okay.

07:23.551 --> 07:25.965
- And Max,
please consider my offer.

07:25.965 --> 07:27.413
Yes, sir.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.000
Alright, thank you.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.000
- Apparently we're staying
at the hotel of a donor.

07:37.379 --> 07:39.413
You trust this shit?

07:39.413 --> 07:40.862
- I'm not sure
what to make of it,

07:40.862 --> 07:43.931
just need to
think it through.

07:43.931 --> 07:47.724
- Yeah, maybe I should
do the same.

07:48.965 --> 07:50.965
- Honestly--
- Yeah, I don't want to talk

07:50.965 --> 07:55.068
- about this in a van right now.
- We have been.

07:55.068 --> 07:57.724
- Not to the degree
that I wanted to.

07:57.724 --> 08:02.413
- If they wanted us dead,
I'm pretty sure we'd be dead.

08:02.413 --> 08:07.206
Maybe it's just not time yet.

08:07.206 --> 08:08.655
Yeah.

08:13.310 --> 08:16.586
- Kyle...
- Yes, sir?

08:16.586 --> 08:18.862
What are you doing?

08:18.862 --> 08:21.068
- I was just looking
over some footage, sir.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.517
For what?

08:22.517 --> 08:24.965
- Chief of Staff
asked me to.

08:24.965 --> 08:27.241
Why?

08:27.241 --> 08:29.517
- You'll have to
take it up with him, sir.

08:29.517 --> 08:32.103
- I will.
- Okay.

08:32.103 --> 08:34.068
I'm going home,

08:34.068 --> 08:35.827
we have a detail on
the First Son,

08:35.827 --> 08:38.862
- that should be 24 hours.
- Yes, sir.

08:41.206 --> 08:43.689
What are you up to?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.379
- I don't know
what you mean.

08:45.379 --> 08:47.862
Yeah, okay.

08:47.862 --> 08:51.206
- Goodnight, sir.
- Yes, sir. Goodnight.

09:01.034 --> 09:02.379
Yes?

09:02.379 --> 09:06.068
- Just know that Sam is,
he's asking questions.

09:06.068 --> 09:07.793
- I don't give a shit
about no Sam,

09:07.793 --> 09:09.379
did you find him?

09:09.379 --> 09:11.172
- Sir, we have checked
every inch of this place,

09:11.172 --> 09:13.137
and we have even brought
in two canines,

09:13.137 --> 09:16.206
and they would find anything
that doesn't belong.

09:16.206 --> 09:17.896
- What the hell is
going on, Kyle?

09:17.896 --> 09:20.379
- I don't know, perhaps--

09:20.379 --> 09:22.793
- I will go and
I will talk to her right now.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.482
- You need me to help
persuade her?

09:24.482 --> 09:26.655
- No, Kyle, I need you
to find that son of a bitch.

09:26.655 --> 09:28.206
Can you do that?
Can you find him?

09:28.206 --> 09:31.413
- Look, sir, I am telling
you that he is not here.

09:31.413 --> 09:33.103
Well, somebody got him out.

09:33.103 --> 09:35.862
- Did she?
- And you not know about it?

09:35.862 --> 09:37.827
- Look, sir,
I may be way off on this,

09:37.827 --> 09:40.206
but the kids did sneak
out of here before.

09:42.379 --> 09:44.551
- This is embarrassing,
you understand?

09:44.551 --> 09:46.689
You guys are -- clowns.

09:46.689 --> 09:48.758
- I'm on it, sir.
- Handle it.

09:48.758 --> 09:50.862
Yes, sir.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.862
- Donald, you are not
allowed in here.

10:09.862 --> 10:12.896
- What was he doing there?
- Get out of here.

10:12.896 --> 10:15.241
- Oh, so you think that I'm
playing around with you,

10:15.241 --> 10:16.689
is that it?

10:16.689 --> 10:18.379
- I don't care
what you're doing.

10:18.379 --> 10:22.034
- Let me say this, if we don't
find him in the next hour,

10:22.034 --> 10:23.724
I'm gonna come back up here
in the morning

10:23.724 --> 10:25.896
and make you tell me everything.

10:25.896 --> 10:29.655
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

10:29.655 --> 10:32.310
- Then you gonna get
shot in the damn face.

10:35.137 --> 10:38.000
- You need a gun
to do that, baby.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.655
'Til morning.

10:46.655 --> 10:49.000
Donald!

10:54.379 --> 10:57.137
- Oh, and your phone?
It won't work in here.

10:57.137 --> 11:01.655
So, you can try to call
for help all you want,

11:01.655 --> 11:03.344
but trust me baby,

11:03.344 --> 11:05.551
you are gonna
tell me everything.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.965
Barry!

11:36.965 --> 11:39.620
Oh, shit, what the...

11:39.620 --> 11:41.586
Who is this?

11:41.586 --> 11:44.586
- Sharon, Mia.
Mia, Sharon.

11:44.586 --> 11:45.965
What are you doing here?

11:45.965 --> 11:48.517
Girl, go home.

11:50.413 --> 11:52.517
- Go ahead home,
I'll talk to you later.

11:52.517 --> 11:54.862
- Uh-uh. Go!

11:54.862 --> 11:58.724
- Go, keep walking.
- Wow.

11:58.724 --> 12:00.275
- Really?
This what we doing?

12:00.275 --> 12:01.965
- What the hell?
- Really, what?

12:01.965 --> 12:05.000
Ain't you supposed to be
somewhere with Kareem?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.689
- I need to talk
to your dad.

12:06.689 --> 12:08.689
- He asleep.
- Go wake him up.

12:08.689 --> 12:10.241
- For what, why? What do you
need to talk him about?

12:10.241 --> 12:12.551
- Barry! Will you just go
wake your dad up?

12:12.551 --> 12:14.310
Okay, fine.

12:14.310 --> 12:17.482
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Yo, what the hell?

12:17.482 --> 12:19.103
- Hey, I had to
make sure you're okay.

12:19.103 --> 12:21.068
- Man, if you don't get the hell
out of my yard--

12:21.068 --> 12:22.758
- No, no, no, I told you,
I'll be fine, alright? Just--

12:22.758 --> 12:24.310
- I don't like you running off
without explaining anything.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.448
- You don't have a say in this.
- Yo, what are y'all two

12:26.448 --> 12:28.896
- doing here? What is going on?
- Go on, just--just go. Go.

12:28.896 --> 12:31.241
- What are you?
- -!

12:31.241 --> 12:34.482
- Hey, Hey.
Yo, y'all come in this house.

12:34.482 --> 12:38.482
Come on in this damn house!
All of you.

12:38.482 --> 12:40.137
Come on in the house,

12:40.137 --> 12:42.103
you know Jody done called us
and told us you were out here.

12:42.103 --> 12:43.275
- Ma, he's not comin' in this--

12:43.275 --> 12:45.241
Come in the house right now!

12:45.241 --> 12:47.241
- Let's go, Let's go.
- Barry, Barry!

12:47.241 --> 12:49.655
- Why's he coming in the house?
- Barry!

12:53.965 --> 12:57.000
- Come on Barry, calm down.
Jesus.

12:59.827 --> 13:01.862
- I don't want him
in this house.

13:01.862 --> 13:03.241
- Alright look,
I think you should go.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.862
- No, no. No. I'm not leaving
until I know you're safe.

13:05.862 --> 13:08.034
- Kareem, I'll be fine,
I'll call you later, I promise.

13:08.034 --> 13:10.172
- Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

13:12.137 --> 13:14.724
- She said she needed
to talk to dad.

13:14.724 --> 13:16.620
Well, what is it?

13:16.620 --> 13:20.827
- Yes, what is it that can't
wait until in the morning?

13:20.827 --> 13:22.551
Tell them, Sharon.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.931
- Talk, girl!
- Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, hey.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.551
- Okay, Okay.
All I know--

13:28.551 --> 13:30.965
- Shh.
- All I know,

13:30.965 --> 13:32.482
since she won't say nothing.

13:32.482 --> 13:34.034
Is that Sharon was in
the pharmacy,

13:34.034 --> 13:35.758
some guy came in, she said
that he tried to rob her

13:35.758 --> 13:37.620
so she shot at him,
but by the time I got back,

13:37.620 --> 13:39.620
she was missing and
the store was wrecked.

13:39.620 --> 13:40.896
What?

13:40.896 --> 13:43.137
- And then when I called 911,
some random man answered

13:43.137 --> 13:44.862
and then handed her
the phone directly.

13:44.862 --> 13:47.206
What are you talking about?

13:47.206 --> 13:48.965
- That's what happened.
That's what happened.

13:48.965 --> 13:50.551
- Alright, stop.
- And the President

13:50.551 --> 13:52.413
of the United States has been
calling her cell phone directly.

13:52.413 --> 13:54.517
- Wait, who's been calling--
- What, what, the President?

13:54.517 --> 13:56.448
No, Sharon, tell them.

13:56.448 --> 13:58.620
- I just need to talk to
Mr. Richard.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.551
Alone, please.

14:00.551 --> 14:03.965
- Okay, come on. Come on.
Let's let them talk.

14:03.965 --> 14:06.689
- No.
- No?

14:06.689 --> 14:08.931
No.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.482
No, no, we shouldn't
talk about this.

14:11.482 --> 14:17.241
Look...
it's been a long night,

14:17.241 --> 14:18.724
and you've been
through a lot,

14:18.724 --> 14:21.000
and you are obviously confused.

14:29.793 --> 14:31.931
Now, now you should
go upstairs,

14:31.931 --> 14:34.068
and you should
get some sleep.

14:34.068 --> 14:37.724
Kareem, you should go home.

14:37.724 --> 14:41.103
And we're all
going to bed.

15:06.310 --> 15:10.068
Does everyone understand me?

15:17.620 --> 15:21.275
Now there is no way that
the President was calling you.

15:21.275 --> 15:23.482
Now he has a call log,
and all calls

15:23.482 --> 15:26.827
in and out of the White House
are monitored.

15:26.827 --> 15:32.379
And I think someone
is playing a joke on you.

15:38.034 --> 15:42.206
Now we, we are all,

15:42.206 --> 15:45.655
going to go,
to bed.

15:52.275 --> 15:54.827
Now Kareem, Kareem,
you go home.

15:54.827 --> 15:57.620
- But I--
- Trust me, boy!

15:57.620 --> 15:59.068
Go home!

16:04.586 --> 16:06.413
I'll call you later, Sharon

16:06.413 --> 16:09.172
Nah, she good, fam.

16:09.172 --> 16:12.482
- Come on, Sharon.
Let's go upstairs.

16:18.793 --> 16:22.206
Dad...

16:22.206 --> 16:25.724
- There's nothing
else to say, son.

16:25.724 --> 16:27.758
Nothing.

16:45.896 --> 16:49.310
Wow. Not bad.

16:49.310 --> 16:52.103
It's exquisite.

16:52.103 --> 16:55.172
Yeah. Anyway.

16:57.206 --> 16:59.620
Must be nice
having wealthy donors.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.482
Yeah, it must be.

17:02.482 --> 17:04.068
- Oh, looks like there's
only one bed.

17:04.068 --> 17:05.931
- I got dibs on--
- And I'm taking it!

17:05.931 --> 17:08.758
Too late, we can fight over it
if you want to, though.

17:08.758 --> 17:10.965
- Cheap assholes couldn't even
get us two beds?

17:10.965 --> 17:13.413
Guess not.

17:16.206 --> 17:19.034
Mr. and Mr. Holmes.

17:19.034 --> 17:21.655
- No.
- Mr. Holmes, I presume.

17:21.655 --> 17:25.931
- Is that what it says?
- Check it for yourself.

17:30.275 --> 17:32.137
- They got us up in here
posing as a gay couple?

17:32.137 --> 17:33.655
And I'm on top, big boy.

17:33.655 --> 17:36.000
- Yeah, then we both
got a problem.

17:40.413 --> 17:42.517
You buying this shit?

17:42.517 --> 17:45.758
- We been over that.
- Yeah, I know.

17:48.620 --> 17:50.344
Anything?

17:50.344 --> 17:52.724
- Clear.
You?

17:55.517 --> 17:56.655
Clear.

18:00.103 --> 18:02.275
Nothing?

18:04.068 --> 18:06.655
- Why would they just bring us
here without monitoring us?

18:09.137 --> 18:11.275
They know we're trained.

18:11.275 --> 18:13.827
Maybe they don't wanna
tip their hand.

18:13.827 --> 18:16.448
I don't know.

18:18.379 --> 18:22.344
- Well, I do know about this
fancy whiskey over here.

18:25.689 --> 18:30.310
- Hey, you gonna call Lilly?
- At some point.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.482
Besides, he's home now.

18:33.482 --> 18:37.137
- Never stopped you before.
- Yeah, you right.

18:37.137 --> 18:38.758
Are you gonna call Blakely?

18:38.758 --> 18:41.931
- No.
- Why not?

18:43.413 --> 18:46.517
Stop playing, man.

18:46.517 --> 18:51.517
- She knows what she's doing.
She wants to lay low.

18:51.517 --> 18:54.034
- We should probably bring
her in on this one.

18:54.034 --> 18:55.620
She doesn't want this.

18:55.620 --> 19:00.241
- Oh, but she does.
You don't want her.

19:00.241 --> 19:04.034
- I don't want anyone else
getting hurt.

19:04.034 --> 19:06.068
Fair enough.

19:08.241 --> 19:10.758
You got something to say?

19:15.172 --> 19:18.000
- I'll go shower then.
- Why do you get to go first?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.241
- You're welcome to join me
if you'd like, hubby.

19:20.241 --> 19:22.241
Nevermind.

19:22.241 --> 19:26.034
- Yeah, I bet you it was a
bubble bath you would, though.

19:30.655 --> 19:31.862
Damn.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.172
What's that?

19:35.172 --> 19:36.758
She's blocked.

19:36.758 --> 19:40.689
- With what?
- Her phone, it's scrambled.

19:40.689 --> 19:43.413
No calls in or out
all around the house.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.068
- Why do you think
that is?

19:47.068 --> 19:49.137
I don't know.

19:49.137 --> 19:51.206
- Don't go over there.
- I'm not.

19:51.206 --> 19:54.000
- Yeah you are.
- I'm not.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
- We'll see...
We'll see...

20:06.172 --> 20:09.000
- Where's Sharon?
- Hi, Dale.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.758
- Hi.
Where's Sharon?

20:12.758 --> 20:15.344
- She's not
coming home tonight.

20:15.344 --> 20:18.862
- Oh, I wanted to say
goodnight to her.

20:18.862 --> 20:20.896
Yeah, I did too.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.137
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:28.827 --> 20:31.379
No.

20:31.379 --> 20:32.862
What's, what's wrong?

20:32.862 --> 20:35.379
- There's some strange
shit going on.

20:35.379 --> 20:37.034
Yeah, what do you mean?

20:37.034 --> 20:40.310
- I mean with the--
- Is she with that guy?

20:40.310 --> 20:42.103
What guy?

20:42.103 --> 20:43.413
Barry?

20:43.413 --> 20:45.724
- No. No I'm not
talking about Barry.

20:45.724 --> 20:47.551
- I'm sorry.
- Nobody was talking about Barry

20:47.551 --> 20:52.034
- Sorry.
- No, it's...

20:52.034 --> 20:54.620
the guy that was messing
with you, what's his name?

20:54.620 --> 20:57.310
- Kyle?
- Yeah, yeah

20:57.310 --> 21:00.344
and he's a
Secret Service agent, right?

21:00.344 --> 21:03.241
Yeah.

21:03.241 --> 21:05.206
Okay.

21:05.206 --> 21:07.206
What's all this about?

21:07.206 --> 21:09.793
- I'm just trying to--
- What?

21:09.793 --> 21:11.689
Did something happen
to her?

21:11.689 --> 21:13.310
- No.
- Kareem--

21:13.310 --> 21:15.758
No, no, that...

21:15.758 --> 21:18.379
Why did you say it
like that?

21:18.379 --> 21:22.034
- I just asked.
- No. No, Dale.

21:22.034 --> 21:23.689
No, I was just asking.

21:23.689 --> 21:26.931
- Dale, you said it
that way for a reason.

21:27.931 --> 21:29.931
- Look, I think he had
something to do

21:29.931 --> 21:33.379
- with me getting shot.
- I knew it.

21:33.379 --> 21:36.586
- Non-lethal rounds and all.

21:36.586 --> 21:40.655
- Is he -- crazy?
- Yes, and they all are.

21:40.655 --> 21:43.344
The President,
all of them.

21:43.344 --> 21:47.034
- The President?
- Yeah.

21:47.034 --> 21:49.034
You should've seen the way
he was looking at her

21:49.034 --> 21:53.137
and flirting with her at
The White House, it was crazy.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.413
This is nuts.

21:55.413 --> 21:57.413
I know.

21:57.413 --> 21:59.448
I just want them all
to leave me alone

21:59.448 --> 22:01.724
and not talk to me again.

22:01.724 --> 22:05.310
It's not a bad idea.

22:05.310 --> 22:08.137
- Now tell me--
- What?

22:08.137 --> 22:10.620
What happened to her.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.275
- I don't know.
She won't tell me.

22:13.275 --> 22:14.827
- Okay, well
I'm gonna call her.

22:14.827 --> 22:18.931
- No, Dale.
Dale, no.

22:18.931 --> 22:21.482
She refuses to talk
on the phone.

22:21.482 --> 22:23.413
- Well, I need to know
if she's okay.

22:23.413 --> 22:26.103
- I need to know
that she's okay, too!

22:26.103 --> 22:27.827
But we're just gonna have
to wait until

22:27.827 --> 22:30.551
we see her at
the pharmacy tomorrow.

22:33.586 --> 22:36.551
- I don't know if I'm ready
to go back to work.

22:36.551 --> 22:39.000
Especially up front.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.275
- I understand.
- Can I just work in the back?

22:42.275 --> 22:45.275
Oh, with us?

22:45.275 --> 22:47.896
Yeah. Yeah sure, we'll be there.

22:47.896 --> 22:51.689
- Alright, thanks.
- Yeah man, of course.

22:51.689 --> 22:53.689
But, it's not even like
it's time

22:53.689 --> 22:55.965
for you to get back to work.

22:55.965 --> 22:59.000
Okay. Thanks.

23:01.896 --> 23:03.827
You should get some rest.

23:03.827 --> 23:05.551
I should be telling you that.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.931
You just got out of
the hospital.

23:07.931 --> 23:10.586
Just go back to being
all relaxed.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.931
Hi, uh...

23:23.931 --> 23:25.551
Did you put the clothes
in the washer?

23:25.551 --> 23:29.103
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.413
Tell her to come see me.

23:31.413 --> 23:34.896
- Okay. Do you want me
to wait outside?

23:34.896 --> 23:36.275
Yeah.

23:36.275 --> 23:38.034
Okay.

23:56.586 --> 23:58.517
You okay?

23:58.517 --> 23:59.931
No.

24:02.068 --> 24:03.172
What happened?

24:06.000 --> 24:09.758
- Um, this agent that Dale
was messing with--

24:09.758 --> 24:12.862
Do you know his name?

24:12.862 --> 24:15.172
- No, Dale knows it.
I can get it.

24:15.172 --> 24:19.275
- Okay, please.
But not, not on the phone.

24:19.275 --> 24:20.931
Okay.

24:20.931 --> 24:24.103
Sharon, what happened?

24:24.103 --> 24:27.034
- He came into the store
and he kidnapped me.

24:27.034 --> 24:30.068
And I shot him,
but he had on a vest.

24:30.068 --> 24:33.103
And he took me to
the White House.

24:33.103 --> 24:34.482
You shot him?

24:34.482 --> 24:35.689
Yeah.

24:35.689 --> 24:40.034
- Jesus.
Then what happened?

24:40.034 --> 24:43.517
- Then we went through some
underground, I don't know,

24:43.517 --> 24:45.068
we went through a garage,

24:45.068 --> 24:46.965
and it was about a block
or two away,

24:46.965 --> 24:48.724
and then we
got off of an elevator,

24:48.724 --> 24:51.034
- we were in the White House.
- Okay.

24:51.034 --> 24:54.034
- And then the President said
that he wanted to see me,

24:54.034 --> 24:56.137
and he said that
he would make me rich.

24:56.137 --> 24:58.551
- Whoa, what,
what the, what?

24:58.551 --> 25:04.000
- He said he would make me
rich if I just slept with him.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.413
Geez.

25:05.413 --> 25:09.689
- And he said that nobody else
would know, but me and him.

25:09.689 --> 25:14.586
And he had an apartment,
money, everything.

25:14.586 --> 25:18.137
Alright...

25:18.137 --> 25:21.724
Sharon, I know
you're not lying.

25:21.724 --> 25:23.655
- No, no, I'm not,
I promise I'm not.

25:23.655 --> 25:27.482
I know, but...

25:27.482 --> 25:29.448
this is, this is hard.

25:29.448 --> 25:30.758
- It is.
- It's a lot.

25:30.758 --> 25:32.655
- It is.
And I don't know what to do

25:32.655 --> 25:35.034
because he's the President.
Like, what?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.482
Okay.

25:41.551 --> 25:43.241
I can help you.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.862
- But, how? I mean,
you work there, but...

25:45.862 --> 25:47.793
That's how I can help you.

25:47.793 --> 25:49.482
I don't like this.

25:49.482 --> 25:54.689
- Look, you just go
and get you some rest, okay?

25:54.689 --> 25:57.172
Okay.

25:57.172 --> 26:01.448
- And know that
your phone is bugged,

26:01.448 --> 26:05.551
so don't talk to anyone
about any of this.

26:05.551 --> 26:08.689
And I'm sure they put some
bugs in your clothes too,

26:08.689 --> 26:11.482
so just be careful
what you say.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.758
- Okay.
- And tell Kareem anything,

26:16.758 --> 26:18.551
but this.

26:18.551 --> 26:22.137
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:26.379 --> 26:28.551
You okay?

26:28.551 --> 26:32.931
- Yeah, I'm, I'm okay.
- Okay.

26:44.413 --> 26:46.448
Uh...

26:46.448 --> 26:48.103
Is it bad?

26:50.103 --> 26:53.137
He is worse than I thought.

26:53.137 --> 26:56.724
- So, what are you
gonna do?

26:56.724 --> 26:59.034
I'm gonna handle it.

27:01.551 --> 27:03.551
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:11.275 --> 27:13.793
Are you okay?

27:13.793 --> 27:17.172
I'm fine.

27:20.758 --> 27:22.655
- Sharon,
tell me what happened.

27:22.655 --> 27:26.034
I can't. I can't.

27:26.034 --> 27:28.827
- Well, is my father gonna
take care of it at least?

27:28.827 --> 27:31.310
As best as he can.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.896
- Sharon, look at you,
you're shaking.

27:32.896 --> 27:34.896
I know.

27:34.896 --> 27:36.965
- Come here. Come here.
- No, stop.

27:36.965 --> 27:38.827
- I'm just...
- No.

27:38.827 --> 27:41.931
- I'm just going to hold you.
- Barry...

27:45.931 --> 27:49.310
- Why are you
being like this?

27:49.310 --> 27:52.103
- Mm-mm, you're not touching me.
- Why not?

27:52.103 --> 27:54.344
- Because you smell like
that girl down there.

27:54.344 --> 27:56.551
Sharon...

27:57.931 --> 28:01.482
- I thought you was over
those Rakadushis.

28:01.482 --> 28:03.137
What?

28:03.137 --> 28:06.241
- Yeah, she looked different
without all that shit on.

28:06.241 --> 28:08.344
- What are you
talking about?

28:08.344 --> 28:11.275
- You didn't know that?
- Know what?

28:11.275 --> 28:15.344
- I see her around the store
all the time.

28:16.586 --> 28:19.655
- What the hell.
- What?

28:19.655 --> 28:22.586
- --!
- What?

28:22.586 --> 28:24.517
What are you doing?

28:24.517 --> 28:27.000
She took the money!

28:27.000 --> 28:28.482
Oh my god.

28:28.482 --> 28:32.482
- No, it was Ruth's money
and she sent her here!

28:32.482 --> 28:35.448
Shit.

28:35.448 --> 28:38.379
Damn it.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.275
Wow.

28:43.275 --> 28:47.137
- Please don't.
Please don't, not right now.

29:04.758 --> 29:09.448
- I'm sorry for your loss.
Who was she to you?

29:09.448 --> 29:12.000
My girlfriend.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.793
I'm sorry.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.310
Yeah.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.862
- We need to ask you
a few questions.

29:16.862 --> 29:19.034
- What?
- What happened?

29:22.689 --> 29:25.620
- We were standing in there,
just talking,

29:25.620 --> 29:29.862
and a bullet just
came through that window.

29:29.862 --> 29:32.896
And um,

29:32.896 --> 29:34.689
that was it.

29:36.827 --> 29:40.724
- Sorry.
- We were two feet apart.

29:42.620 --> 29:46.137
- It's horrible
when these things happen.

29:46.137 --> 29:48.034
I don't understand.

29:48.034 --> 29:51.655
We arrested several people.

29:51.655 --> 29:52.965
What?

29:52.965 --> 29:54.379
- Yeah, there was
a gang shootout

29:54.379 --> 29:55.758
in the building
behind yours.

29:58.034 --> 30:01.344
It was a stray bullet.

30:01.344 --> 30:05.000
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.034
How can you be so sure?

30:07.034 --> 30:08.310
- Well, we caught a
guy running,

30:08.310 --> 30:10.965
and we have a confession.
We'll run ballistics,

30:10.965 --> 30:14.482
but we're pretty sure
we know what happened.

30:16.862 --> 30:20.586
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

30:37.413 --> 30:40.275
- Shit.
- Good morning.

30:43.827 --> 30:45.827
- It was so hard
for me to sleep

30:45.827 --> 30:47.482
with you standing there
like that.

30:47.482 --> 30:49.689
- Well, you seemed
to do fine.

30:52.655 --> 30:56.551
- Look, do you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

30:56.551 --> 31:00.793
- I don't know, sir.
- Why are you here?

31:00.793 --> 31:03.241
To assist you, sir.

31:03.241 --> 31:05.586
- Oh yeah?
You want to assist me?

31:05.586 --> 31:07.206
Yes, sir.

31:07.206 --> 31:09.517
- Why don't you open the window
and jump out of it?

31:09.517 --> 31:13.413
- We won't be doing
that today, sir.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.965
- Hey,
you're Secret Service, right?

31:17.965 --> 31:19.586
Where's my sister?

31:19.586 --> 31:21.206
- Sir?
- My sister.

31:21.206 --> 31:24.413
My mother sent her away,
I haven't seen her since.

31:24.413 --> 31:26.758
- I don't know
where your sister is, sir.

31:26.758 --> 31:29.068
- Is she -- you, too?
- Sir?

31:29.068 --> 31:30.758
My mom.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.827
Are you one of the boy toys
that she's screwing?

31:32.827 --> 31:36.448
- Sir, you really should, uh,
start your day.

31:36.448 --> 31:40.517
- Start my day? What do you
think I do, homework?

31:40.517 --> 31:42.827
This is my day.

31:42.827 --> 31:45.000
Yes, sir.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.655
- Yeah, you're screwing her.
I can see it.

31:49.655 --> 31:52.586
How much is she paying you
for that? Good rate?

31:52.586 --> 31:57.551
- Son, you really
should be quiet.

31:57.551 --> 31:59.689
- Yeah, what are you
gonna do?

31:59.689 --> 32:03.206
- Well, I have permission
to keep you in line.

32:03.206 --> 32:05.862
Okay.

32:08.034 --> 32:11.344
Then maybe you should get up.

32:12.793 --> 32:15.689
- Fine. Okay.
I'm going. Okay. I'm going.

32:19.827 --> 32:23.793
- I need to take a shower.
- Yes, that's correct.

32:25.965 --> 32:27.482
- You're not gonna watch me,
are you?

32:27.482 --> 32:30.827
- Yes I will.
- What?

32:30.827 --> 32:34.000
Look, that's like illegal.
I'm underage.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.827
- Sir, I'm uh,
here for your protection,

32:36.827 --> 32:38.413
not to harm you.

32:38.413 --> 32:40.172
- Yeah, but you don't think
that watching me shower

32:40.172 --> 32:42.000
is harming me?

32:42.000 --> 32:46.206
- Well, maybe if you behaved
yourself,

32:46.206 --> 32:48.931
you wouldn't
need an escort, sir.

32:48.931 --> 32:52.068
- -- off.
- Yes, sir.

32:52.068 --> 32:55.034
- No, that's what I'm gonna
do in there.

32:55.034 --> 32:59.448
- I'm gonna be --.
- Yes, sir.

32:59.448 --> 33:02.241
- I'm gonna be --
and pleasuring myself

33:02.241 --> 33:04.241
for a really, really
long time,

33:04.241 --> 33:06.655
so I really hope
you enjoy that.

33:06.655 --> 33:08.103
- Sir?
- Yeah?

33:08.103 --> 33:09.793
I'm going to warn you,

33:09.793 --> 33:11.862
if you do that, then I will be
forced to be sure

33:11.862 --> 33:14.034
you never do that again.

33:14.034 --> 33:17.379
- Oh fun,
I love a good challenge.

33:24.344 --> 33:26.413
- This -- kid.

33:31.448 --> 33:33.965
- Dude, what the hell
are you doing?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.586
- I wasn't laying
on that sofa.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.862
- No. No, no, no, no,
This shit ain't gonna work.

33:43.862 --> 33:47.517
- Yeah, you're telling me.
You got the worst damn gas.

33:47.517 --> 33:49.241
Yeah? That's my way of saying

33:49.241 --> 33:50.862
"Get the --
out of the bed."

33:50.862 --> 33:54.000
It almost worked.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.586
Don't smile at me.

34:02.275 --> 34:04.275
I thought you would have
talked to her.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.103
Nope.

34:06.103 --> 34:09.206
You didn't go?

34:09.206 --> 34:11.379
- No.
Told you I wasn't.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.000
Wow.

34:20.172 --> 34:22.827
Do you believe
the Vice President?

34:22.827 --> 34:25.000
- Gotta give him
the benefit of the doubt.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.517
Yeah.

34:27.517 --> 34:30.344
Aren't you worried about her?

34:30.344 --> 34:33.724
- Of course I am.
- And you're not going?

34:33.724 --> 34:36.931
- What are you doing?
- What?

34:36.931 --> 34:39.310
You want me to go or not?

34:39.310 --> 34:43.241
- I want you to do whatever
you feel is right.

34:43.241 --> 34:44.896
Bullshit.

34:47.413 --> 34:48.931
You trying to get rid of me,
aren't you?

34:48.931 --> 34:51.172
- I thought the farts
would've done that.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.551
- Almost did.

34:56.517 --> 34:58.758
- You expecting someone?

34:58.758 --> 35:00.413
No, sir.

35:04.827 --> 35:06.965
Who is it?

35:06.965 --> 35:08.931
It's me.

35:08.931 --> 35:10.724
"Me?"

35:19.275 --> 35:21.068
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:24.655 --> 35:26.275
How was your night?

35:26.275 --> 35:27.689
It was great.

35:30.068 --> 35:31.827
Good.

35:31.827 --> 35:34.000
- Any reason why
we're a gay couple?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.793
- There's a convention
in town for gay rights,

35:35.793 --> 35:38.275
and we thought we could
hide you guys in plain sight.

35:38.275 --> 35:41.000
And uh, no two beds?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.655
Sorry. Sold out.

35:49.275 --> 35:51.896
So, what brings you by?

35:51.896 --> 35:53.482
- Have you guys
thought about my offer?

35:53.482 --> 35:55.551
- Still thinking about it.
- Mm-hmm.

35:57.586 --> 35:59.551
- Okay, what do I got to do
to prove to you guys

35:59.551 --> 36:01.448
that I'm on the
right side of this?

36:01.448 --> 36:02.862
- I don't know, sir, but--

36:02.862 --> 36:05.172
- He thinks you just want
to be the President.

36:05.172 --> 36:06.758
Well, he's not wrong.

36:06.758 --> 36:09.103
- So then why should we trust
that you're any better than him?

36:09.103 --> 36:10.551
Because I'm your brother,

36:10.551 --> 36:12.034
I was in the military,
same as you.

36:12.034 --> 36:13.586
And I love this country.

36:13.586 --> 36:16.551
And this man is really
horrible for the nation.

36:16.551 --> 36:18.517
Yeah, we know that.

36:18.517 --> 36:20.482
- Well, I have to fix it.
And I can do it.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.655
- Well, you have
an uphill battle.

36:23.655 --> 36:26.310
- I'm aware of that,
but I'm going to do it.

36:26.310 --> 36:28.620
Well, we're not so sure.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.862
Okay, well, fair warning,

36:30.862 --> 36:32.965
things are about to get
really intense around here.

36:32.965 --> 36:35.310
I'm about to go public
with what I have so far.

36:35.310 --> 36:37.379
- What?
- Yeah.

36:37.379 --> 36:39.931
I'm on my way to the White House
right now to see the President.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.724
- You think that's smart?
- Yeah.

36:42.724 --> 36:45.103
And I'll expose you two as
heroes and let the world know

36:45.103 --> 36:47.551
that you're going to be
my security detail.

36:47.551 --> 36:49.586
Wait, wait, what?

36:49.586 --> 36:51.724
- That way they'll be
scared to touch you.

36:53.448 --> 36:55.241
You're serious?

36:55.241 --> 36:57.103
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

36:58.275 --> 37:00.793
How will that work?

37:00.793 --> 37:03.172
- I'm going to tell
the President and the press

37:03.172 --> 37:04.862
everything I know so far.

37:04.862 --> 37:08.482
- You better be careful
doing that.

37:08.482 --> 37:10.965
- That's why I want
you two with me.

37:10.965 --> 37:12.068
What?

37:12.068 --> 37:14.000
That's right.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.413
- So, you want the two of us to
go with you to the White House?

37:17.413 --> 37:19.206
Suits are in the closet.

37:19.206 --> 37:22.620
- Mr. Vice President, are you
sure that you want to do this?

37:22.620 --> 37:25.275
- Yes. I spoke
to my wife about it,

37:25.275 --> 37:27.517
and I'm going to do it.

37:27.517 --> 37:31.896
Well, sir, I don't know if...

37:31.896 --> 37:35.724
- Get dressed, a car will be
here for you in an hour.

37:38.896 --> 37:41.103
- Are you gonna tell him
that you're doing this?

37:41.103 --> 37:43.241
- Yeah, I'll see
how he feels about it.

37:43.241 --> 37:44.689
Make him squirm a bit.

37:44.689 --> 37:47.517
- Listen to me,
this isn't a game.

37:47.517 --> 37:49.586
You need to be careful.

37:49.586 --> 37:51.344
- The car will be here
in an hour.

37:51.344 --> 37:53.172
Be ready.

38:04.482 --> 38:07.068
He's gonna get killed.

38:07.068 --> 38:11.551
- No, he's the V.P.
He wouldn't dare.

38:11.551 --> 38:13.275
They would.

38:17.413 --> 38:20.103
You going or not?

38:23.551 --> 38:26.862
- Hell yeah.
Why not?

38:29.896 --> 38:32.482
- Yes?
- Good morning.

38:32.482 --> 38:35.275
- Anything?
- Nothing.

38:35.275 --> 38:37.379
What the hell, Kyle?

38:37.379 --> 38:40.034
- I know Donald,
I'm sorry.

38:40.034 --> 38:42.586
- Where are you?
- I'm at the door.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.103
What happened?

38:53.103 --> 38:55.206
Not a sign of him.

38:55.206 --> 38:56.413
You're kidding me, right?

38:56.413 --> 38:58.586
No.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.724
- Uh, Kyle,
he didn't just disappear.

39:01.724 --> 39:04.275
- I think he did.
- How? Hm?

39:04.275 --> 39:05.793
How is that possible?

39:05.793 --> 39:07.965
- Look Donald,
he's not at the White House.

39:07.965 --> 39:12.758
- Yeah, I can see that,
but that's not an answer, Kyle.

39:12.758 --> 39:15.655
He had to have some help.

39:15.655 --> 39:18.965
- She got him in?
- Mm-mm, no.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.310
What?

39:20.310 --> 39:22.344
- No, she had to have some
major help getting him out.

39:22.344 --> 39:25.379
- Like who?
- I don't know.

39:25.379 --> 39:26.896
Someone powerful.

39:26.896 --> 39:31.137
No. No, I'm the powerful one.

39:31.137 --> 39:34.896
- You think the President?
- Now why would he do that?

39:34.896 --> 39:37.655
- I don't know,
he's a really strange guy.

39:37.655 --> 39:41.275
- No, no, no, no, no way,
think, think, think.

39:41.275 --> 39:45.206
- What about the First Lady?
- Hell no.

39:45.206 --> 39:48.068
- Alright. Well, I'm gonna head
back to the White House,

39:48.068 --> 39:49.689
I'll see what else
I can dig up.

39:49.689 --> 39:52.034
Okay, this makes no sense.

39:52.034 --> 39:55.000
I know that it doesn't, sir.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.344
- So where the hell
is he, Kyle? Huh?

39:59.965 --> 40:02.758
- Look Donald, I don't know
where he is,

40:02.758 --> 40:08.241
- but I think that...
- No, no, she doesn't.

40:08.241 --> 40:11.068
She does, baby.

40:15.724 --> 40:17.689
Come on.

40:22.206 --> 40:23.931
Shit.

40:34.379 --> 40:36.655
What are you doing up here?

40:39.172 --> 40:43.275
Oh, what is this?

40:43.275 --> 40:47.827
- Oh baby, you are gonna
tell us everything.

40:47.827 --> 40:51.137

ménage à trois or something?

40:51.137 --> 40:55.413
- Oh, you think this is a joke?
- Yes. Both of you are.

40:55.413 --> 40:57.620

- Where is he?
And why was he there? Hm?

41:10.551 --> 41:13.827
- Oh my god, I have no idea
who you're talking about.

41:13.827 --> 41:18.137
- Okay. Kyle?
- Yes?

41:18.137 --> 41:20.310
Glove up.

41:20.310 --> 41:25.034
- Oh, oh.

41:25.034 --> 41:28.172
Is that slang for condom?

41:28.172 --> 41:30.206
No, baby,

41:30.206 --> 41:33.931
that's slang for,
"kill this bitch."

41:35.448 --> 41:37.758
Donald...

41:38.517 --> 41:41.000
Do it.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.344

41:51.586 --> 41:54.275

- I didn't do anything.

41:57.655 --> 42:00.034
Are you out of your mind?

42:00.034 --> 42:02.275
- Can't do anything more,
I've gone all the way up.

42:02.275 --> 42:05.275
- Is that why you
brought Bobby in?

42:05.275 --> 42:06.655
Bobby?

42:06.655 --> 42:08.689

this opportunity to resign.

I'm going to the press,
and I will ruin your -- life!
