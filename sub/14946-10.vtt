00:01.377 --> 00:02.787
KIERA:
Previously on Continuum...

00:03.004 --> 00:04.039
Two of me.

00:04.797 --> 00:05.786
Two of her?

00:06.007 --> 00:06.996
Yep.

00:07.091 --> 00:09.423
You fight a disease
by catching it while
it's still treatable.

00:09.594 --> 00:11.710
HALO will monitor you
on every level.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.340
It's like I am not
of this time.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.423
You're gonna
wanna fit in.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.139
I've had
my representatives
tend you an offer

00:21.230 --> 00:22.436
for SadTech Incorporated

00:22.523 --> 00:23.603
and all
intellectual property,

00:23.691 --> 00:25.807
including your
exclusive services.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.282
(GROANING)

00:36.370 --> 00:38.110
(BREATHING HEAVILY) No!

00:39.457 --> 00:40.537
No!

00:42.084 --> 00:43.073
No!

00:46.047 --> 00:47.127
Shit.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.085
It's okay.
It's okay.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.764
(SWITCH CLICKS)
It's okay.

00:57.308 --> 00:58.593
Are you okay?

01:00.394 --> 01:04.558
They're blue,
like little jewels.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.398
They came loose
off the string.

01:07.485 --> 01:08.975
The necklace is worthless.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.193
But my daughter,
shejust... (SNIFFLES)

01:15.534 --> 01:16.740
Keep going.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.034
Try to remember.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.488
She just had to
gather them up.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.122
Kept them...

01:31.259 --> 01:32.499
Right by the windowsill.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.134
It's the middle of the night,
why is it so bright out?

01:41.519 --> 01:42.975
You can see
every point of light

01:43.062 --> 01:44.347
from every window.

01:45.356 --> 01:47.688
The towers should be dark,
you can't even see the stars.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.526
Why would
the towers be dark?

01:49.610 --> 01:50.690
Because”.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.312
Because”.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.450
Ribbons of dark,
slashed a starlit sky.

02:01.289 --> 02:05.077
Something...
Something we defy.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.830
Because it's dangerous.

02:09.380 --> 02:10.995
Towers are dark.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.633
It's working.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.307
That's it.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.269
That's it! That's it!

02:31.736 --> 02:33.192
Hey, no, no, no! Don't.

02:33.738 --> 02:36.605
It's good. It's good,
but just watch
the merchandise.

02:36.699 --> 02:37.814
That's contents
under pressure here.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.444
It's stable.
The yields have been off,

02:39.535 --> 02:41.150
imperfect,
every single one of them,

02:41.412 --> 02:42.572
like a dirty ice cube.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.069
But then lwas thinking,

02:44.498 --> 02:46.489
there's an element to this
that's bio-organic.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.578
Well, you had me
at "ice cube."

02:49.420 --> 02:51.251
I'm gonna go get us
a couple sodas.
You want one?

02:51.380 --> 02:53.541
Cloned. It needed
to be cloned, not made.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.673
You clone the organic part
of the liquid chip down
to the very last detail

02:56.761 --> 02:58.752
and the DNA integrates
with the nano-circuitry.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.178
Hsudtsamaﬂnm
VVeH,yeah.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.971
It's revolutionary!
That, too.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.055
lt's...

03:04.143 --> 03:06.350
Something you created
in 2028.

03:06.479 --> 03:07.468
(CHUCKLES)

03:08.356 --> 03:09.812
I'll have the yield of 40
ready by the morning.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.264
We'll put them
in the new test units.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.436
Okay.

03:17.573 --> 03:18.608
I want to be first.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.526
What?
HALO, lwant to test it.
Can I be first?

03:23.245 --> 03:24.234
Dad?

03:39.720 --> 03:40.960
That little shit.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.979
BETTY: So there’s dental?

04:31.313 --> 04:32.268
DILLON: Of course,
there ’3 dental.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.096
What kind of a police force
do you think
I’m running, here?

04:34.984 --> 04:36.849
Well, you haven't
seen my teeth. (LAUGHS)

04:38.446 --> 04:40.027
Stats say crime
with a cyber-bend

04:40.114 --> 04:41.604
is up 28% this year.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.314
Now, that trend line
is only going up.

04:43.409 --> 04:44.694
We need to get this division

04:44.785 --> 04:46.161
into the 21 st century fast.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.701
I can definitely
help you with that.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.530
Some enthusiastic,

04:50.624 --> 04:52.364
youthful hijinks here,
Miss Robertson.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.575
I'm gonna have
to smooth some of this

04:53.669 --> 04:54.658
to get you cleared.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.660
I am strictly white hat.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.503
I mean, I like to poke
around systems,

04:58.591 --> 05:00.206
but I clean up my campsite.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.885
So no more surprises
to come?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.960
No, sir. Boss.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.009
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

05:05.097 --> 05:06.633
Hey, you wanted to see me?
Yes.

05:06.724 --> 05:07.884
Detective Carlos Fonnegra,

05:07.975 --> 05:09.431
this is Betty Robertson.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.725
She is going to be joining
our little crew here.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.186
She knows her way
around the cyber.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.226
Thank God,
it'll be good to have you.

05:16.692 --> 05:17.898
Come see me
when you're settled.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.100
There's a couple things
I could use your help with.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.068
Okay.
Welcome to the family.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.155
So dental's
not the only perk.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.501
Cameron?

05:42.843 --> 05:44.049
Ihavent
been sleeping.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.219
I know, in my bones,
that we're not doing

05:47.306 --> 05:49.297
everything we can
to nail Liber8.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.428
Sir, you've got
half of a division on it,

05:51.519 --> 05:53.510
plus Piron resources.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.391
Well, it's clear
that they've become
stronger, smarter.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.189
They've stepped up
their PR war.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.892
We've made
some unforced errors.

06:05.491 --> 06:06.856
I did something terrible.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.991
I pushed my daughter
out there as bait.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.240
Christine's arrest.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.370
We cooked it up together.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.751
She was trying
to impress me,

06:19.838 --> 06:22.124
I knew it
and I let her do it.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.798
Betty told me
something was up.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.128
Liber8 can't resist
the symbolism.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.885
A VPD inspector's daughter.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.010
She was released last week
and I can't get to her.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.470
What would you
like me to do?

06:38.399 --> 06:39.559
You seem to know
these people

06:39.650 --> 06:40.765
better than any of us.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.850
You anticipate them.

06:43.696 --> 06:46.028
Just get Christine
clear, please.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.856
I don't care how you do it.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.364
Yes, sir.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.948
Cameron.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.250
No more Bettys.

07:03.716 --> 07:04.876
No more Bettys.

07:06.885 --> 07:10.298
No, Iwould not
like to leave a message
for Mr. Sadler.

07:10.389 --> 07:13.301
And I do not
want to talk to
the Piron VPD liaison.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.593
I'll tell you what.
You tell that little shit
that he better call me back

07:16.687 --> 07:18.598
or I'm gonna
come down there
and wring his neck.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.347
Are you okay?

07:21.609 --> 07:22.644
Yeah, fine.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.067
What's this?

07:27.031 --> 07:29.613
I've been going over
Liber8's recent moves.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.281
They've been
laser focused,

07:31.368 --> 07:34.075
targeting all
of the companies
that make up the GCC,

07:34.413 --> 07:36.028
Global Corporate Congress.
Yeah, I know.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.574
Some of the players
aren't around yet,
won't be around for decades.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.167
But Sonmanto, Fermitas.
Look at the list.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.869
Yes, yes and yes.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.212
It fits. You're right.
What else?

07:46.300 --> 07:48.131
That leaves only
a few corporations

07:48.218 --> 07:50.209
who have yet to feel
Liber8's boot on their neck.

07:51.055 --> 07:52.090
Skip to G.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.890
Gautuma?
Yes, a pharmaceutical company.

07:57.394 --> 08:01.057
It's small for now,
but Gautuma is going
to grow exponentially.

08:01.774 --> 08:03.480
They pioneer nano-medicine.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.229
They create
self-evolving antibiotics

08:06.320 --> 08:08.527
that adapt to
new strains of diseases.

08:08.614 --> 08:11.230
(SCOFFS) Yeah, and the cure
to the common cold I'm sure.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.522
Yeah.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.241
They upend the industry.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.365
Within three decades,
they swallow
every competitor.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.825
So they become a monopoly?

08:18.916 --> 08:20.622
And they're not shy
about using the power.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.746
Sonya Valentine, any doctor,
would have a lot to say
about these guys.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.250
I wouldn't be surprised
if Liber8 was
casing them already.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.001
Certainly worth
a friendly visit.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.587
Oh, hey,
how's that houseguest,
by the way?

08:32.096 --> 08:33.131
Still sleeping
on the couch?

08:35.557 --> 08:37.172
What's that
supposed to mean?

08:38.102 --> 08:41.060
I'm sorry, Detectives,
but I simply don't see
the logic.

08:41.647 --> 08:44.810
If Liber8 wants to
take down big Pharma,
that's not us.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.731
We are the poor relations,
at best.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.609
Try Pfizer, Merck, Glaxo.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.778
Anybody else, really.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.073
We have reason to believe
Liber8 may have
an interest in Gautuma.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.316
Based on what?

08:56.412 --> 08:57.401
It may be personal.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.073
I highly doubt that.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.577
Liber8 doesn't always
come in with a battering ram
through the front door.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.952
It might help
ifwe knew a bit of your
development slate.

09:06.463 --> 09:10.126
What are you working on
that might be of interest
to a terrorist group?

09:10.384 --> 09:11.373
Or our competitors?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.800
Think of this as
a free threat assessment.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.340
Why don't we do a tour?

09:29.319 --> 09:30.308
(LINE RINGING)

09:31.071 --> 09:32.060
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

09:34.783 --> 09:36.023
Why are you contacting us?

09:36.118 --> 09:37.733
You're there
to observe and wait.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.656
I know.
You’re barely
in place a week,

09:40.289 --> 09:42.029
you haven't filed
a log in the data
we've tasked you to...

09:42.124 --> 09:43.113
VPD.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.239
Say again?

09:44.334 --> 09:46.711
Detective Fonnegra and
the other one, Cameron,
they're here.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.952
Okay, stay out of sight,

09:49.047 --> 09:50.457
wait for instructions.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.215
Sonya.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.261
Yeah?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.509
Dillon's kid,
the one we just placed
in Gautuma

10:00.601 --> 10:01.807
says the protector
just showed up.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.216
(EXHALES)

10:04.313 --> 10:06.349
It has to be a coincidence.
We're just gathering intel.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.644
Okay, well, either Cameron's
getting better or
we're slipping.

10:13.155 --> 10:16.113
Labs and testing are here,
manufacturing is off site.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.657
We've reviewed security
twice in the last year,

10:18.744 --> 10:20.575
we're hyper vigilant
with our supply chain.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.112
We saw contractors
a few minutes ago.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.072
Where were they going?
Fifth floor.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.249
We're expanding
our marketing division.

10:27.336 --> 10:30.078
More money into marketing,
truly impressive security,

10:30.172 --> 10:32.458
a general air
of increased activity,

10:32.549 --> 10:33.709
I mean, you can feel it.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.171
And ifyou don't
mind me saying so,

10:36.553 --> 10:37.759
you seem a bit anxious.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.136
Anxious is completely
the wrong word.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.598
The truth is we're entering
testing on something big.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.055
A game changer.
Yeah? Next little blue pill?

10:46.814 --> 10:48.054
Much more important.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.274
One of the worst things
in life is watching
our parents fade.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.487
It's cruel, inhuman.

10:55.239 --> 10:57.104
We're on the cusp
of making that obsolete.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.402
Alzheimer's. Dementia.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.901
We're heading into trials
and it looks very good.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.956
Why would Liber8
want to stand
in the way of that?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.669
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have eight messages.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.254
How many messages
from Carlos Fonnegra?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.162
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have eight messages
from Carlos...

11:13.257 --> 11:14.292
Delete.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.801
Alec? There's something
you need to see.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.932
Do you know what this is?

11:26.645 --> 11:28.135
Yes, and you have to go.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.511
Jason, come on in.

11:34.778 --> 11:35.767
Morning, Alec.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.769
Good morning.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.354
JACQUELINE: How are
you feeling, Jason?

11:39.449 --> 11:40.700
Great.

11:40.784 --> 11:41.773
Crystal clear.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.998
It's like a fog lifted.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.292
Holy shit.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.167
It's the chip.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.873
It integrates better
than we'd ever dreamed.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.208
I don't know
why this works.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.761
I always figured it
for a wiring issue, myself.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.679
Ifyou're gonna make
a time omelet,

12:04.766 --> 12:05.801
you gotta scramble
a few eggs.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.807
Wait, that sounds like
something you would say.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.931
Well, it doesn't fix
your sense of humor.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.979
This is incredible!
Do you know
what this means?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.897
It means HALO is headed
in the right direction.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.063
Hmm. Shame we can't
tell that story.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.356
What? Why can't we?

12:18.447 --> 12:20.563
Ifwe tell people
how HALO helped me,

12:20.657 --> 12:21.942
it's bound to
raise a few questions.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.822
Questions nobody
really wants answered.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.153
JACQUELINE:
Never mind.

12:28.874 --> 12:31.741
It's a bright spot,
and one we really need.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.702
Launch plans,
manufacturing facilities,
approvals,

12:34.796 --> 12:36.411
they're all behind,
severely.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.495
What's holding
everything up?

12:37.591 --> 12:38.580
You have to get
to that meeting.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.540
And, no,
you cannot reschedule.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.549
Gautuma's not ready
to go public
with a drug trial.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.632
So, I did some
digging around

12:47.726 --> 12:50.559
to see if there's
any insider information
getting leaked out.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.307
Checked security filings.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.686
Guess who popped up
buying large swaths
of Gautuma stock?

12:57.861 --> 12:59.852
Matthew Kellog.
Bingo.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.687
Think he knows something?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.821
Matthew always
knows something.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.650
It's figuring out
whether you can trust
what he knows.

13:06.745 --> 13:07.860
That's the difficult part.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.570
I'll be back.
Want me to tag along?

13:11.333 --> 13:14.291
No, Matthew's better
when he thinks
he's charming me.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.333
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
I should go...

13:15.420 --> 13:16.876
That's Christine Dillon.

13:20.384 --> 13:23.467
I've vetted some
of the recent hires
at Gautuma.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.554
Well, who's May Policetto?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.716
She was born in 2056.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.013
She died a Liber8 martyr

13:33.105 --> 13:35.642
six months before the attack
on the Corporate Congress.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.225
So Dillon's daughter
taking that name
is not a coincidence.

13:42.406 --> 13:43.395
No.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.899
Liber8 got her
a custodial job at Gautuma.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.661
What the hell is he thinking,
putting his own daughter
in undercover?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.252
That's... That's insane!

13:56.712 --> 13:57.747
And it worked.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.918
Okay, we put surveillance
on Gautuma.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.339
We sit on them,
wait for them
to make their move,

14:06.888 --> 14:09.049
catch them in the act
or we follow them
back to their hole.

14:09.141 --> 14:12.554
But none of that
is possible if
we warn her.

14:12.644 --> 14:15.431
For all we know,
Liber8 has
low level people

14:15.522 --> 14:17.353
in half of
the corporations
in this city.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.524
Yeah, you may be right,
but this is the only one
we know about for sure.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.482
Plus, it may be a chance
to get one back for Betty.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.271
It's a big risk.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.231
Hell, yeah,
it's a big risk.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.696
But Dillon's been putting
this department at risk
for months.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.199
He never talked to us
when he wanted
to change the rules,

14:33.290 --> 14:34.700
and he's the one
that put this in motion.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.200
If this was
anybody else's kid,

14:38.295 --> 14:40.377
do you think that
he would blow the best lead
we had in months?

14:40.464 --> 14:41.499
No.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.463

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:45.802 --> 14:47.463
This one I need
to think through.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.387
Okay. I need
to take this.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.635
Track down Kellog, huh?

14:58.523 --> 15:00.184
Start talking,
Mr. Sadler.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.390
You've got it all wrong.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.942
Real/y? So you’re not
a body-snatching
little ghoul?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.728
You know, I oughta
take your head and
bounce it off the...

15:06.823 --> 15:07.812
I’m sorry.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.531
I wanted to do something.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.733
You're the one who said
it was too much
for you to handle.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.944
Where is she?
Safe.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.952
Obviously, any normal service
is out of the question.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.826
We'll say a proper goodbye.
I'm planning it now.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.586
VVhen?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.334
Just leave itwith me, okay?

15:39.064 --> 15:42.682
Congratulations on Piron,
young Mr. Sadler.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.149
You've shaken things up.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.276
I've heard about
things like this.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.487
Are we gonna talk about
overthrowing governments?

15:49.574 --> 15:50.859
Fixing the price of oil?

15:51.701 --> 15:53.202
We'd like to talk
aboutyou.

15:53.537 --> 15:54.652
You need to...

15:54.746 --> 15:56.953
What's that expression
my grandson likes?

15:57.791 --> 15:58.871
Slow your roll.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.249
Oh, hey.
The salmon here is amazing.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.127
Can you believe
they actually catch it,
in the wild?

16:08.718 --> 16:10.583
Why are you buying up
so much Gautuma stock?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.460
Oh.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.425
So this is how
it's gonna be with us now?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.181
I small talk,
you go right to business?

16:17.269 --> 16:18.384
Okay, that hurts.

16:20.272 --> 16:22.137
Well, they're undervalued,
for one.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.722
You and I both know
by how much.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.307
I don't know,
maybe I'm making
a long play.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.942
And maybe your friends
are about to try something.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.404
Yeah, because Liber8
really wants to increase
my stock's value.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.028
You usually have
a better working
theory than this.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.654
Gautuma is starting
drug trials.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.406
Alzheimer's drug, I know.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.362
Soundser
a sure thing to me.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.118
Or a familiar thing, anyway.

16:41.877 --> 16:45.540
Flash, Kellog,
was originally
an Alzheimer's drug.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.619
Oh, yeah, itwas,
wasn't it?

16:47.841 --> 16:50.298
But the good folk
from the VPD took Flash
off the street.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.751
I seem to remember
it was a big win.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.467
I've finished my coffee.

16:57.559 --> 16:58.594
It's good to see you.

Kellog was no help,

17:10.280 --> 17:11.941
except he thinks the drug
might be something

17:12.032 --> 17:13.067
that we've seen before.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.068
Pull all the files
on Flash.

17:15.869 --> 17:16.904
I have to go.

17:17.829 --> 17:18.909
Don't. You can't do that.

17:19.831 --> 17:20.866
Why not?

17:21.124 --> 17:23.240
Because it will
trigger a response.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.084
Ifyou power it up,
they might know
it's not from this time

17:26.171 --> 17:27.456
and then
they will find you.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.128
Who are they?
It's a long story.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.003
Suffice it to say,
they're dangerous.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.008
So what good
is this, then?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.962
I have a wife
and a child

17:37.057 --> 17:38.297
and I don't even know
their names.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.767
How is that
of any use to me?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.019

and I was sent here

17:42.103 --> 17:43.183
to do something,

17:43.271 --> 17:45.136
but all I remember is this.

figure this out.

I'm going to work.

gonna hurt you,

18:09.172 --> 18:10.673

seen me coming.
Get in.

Maybe that
sentimental bullshit
is your way back.

They're close to the bone
so you remember family first.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.179
My son, Sam,

18:24.938 --> 18:26.769
he won't be born
for 60 years

18:26.856 --> 18:29.689
but, ugh,
how I clung to him.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.647
The memories of him
when I first came here,

18:34.281 --> 18:35.521
they got me through.

18:36.408 --> 18:39.775
Yeah, butwhat good
are memories
of someone who isn't real?

18:40.453 --> 18:41.863
Might never be real?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.870
If they haven't
been born yet,

18:45.041 --> 18:46.997
we haven't had
the chance to leave them.

18:47.877 --> 18:48.866
Neither of us.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.878
Wow, that is
a strange way to parse it.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.330
We suffer
for our children,

18:53.425 --> 18:56.542
we fear we are
putting them in
harm's way every day.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.388
And sometimes
we can't help it.

19:01.224 --> 19:05.718
I used to think
being here was
putting Sam in danger,

19:05.812 --> 19:10.272
but maybe,
I'm protecting him somehow.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.563
Maybe Dillon was right.

19:15.697 --> 19:16.686
Who's Dillon?

a lot on my mind.

Scratchy images
playing in my head
do me no good at all.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.666
Is there something
in your cuff?

19:36.384 --> 19:37.794
It's a key.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.757
Does that mean
anything to you?

no new busts or incidents

basically dried up.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.530
Maybe Kellog was
yanking your chain.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.240
The only way to find out
is to get a sample of

20:44.327 --> 20:45.737
Gautuma's Alzheimer's drug.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.410
Just walk through this
with me for a second.

this big breakthrough
is indeed Flash.

to make Gautuma rich?

I don't know.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.749
The car that I had sitting
on Gautuma said that

May Policetto was a no-show
at work this morning.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.559
So the combined message
was that I was
rocking the boat

21:08.643 --> 21:09.723
and I needed
to slow down.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.551
Really? The nerve.

they'll sink us

and labor, ifwe don't...

Okay. (SHUSHING)

21:21.614 --> 21:23.070
Leave the star chamber
crowd to me.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.822
But I need you
to do something.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.025
What?

21:27.245 --> 21:28.781
If HALO is gonna be
what you want it to be,

21:28.872 --> 21:30.282
it's gotta be
more than a product.

21:30.415 --> 21:31.871
It's gotta be
a social movement.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.582
It needs to align
with people's values

21:35.044 --> 21:38.002
in a completely new
and revolutionary way.

rappers or rock stars.

21:41.509 --> 21:42.498
Oh, kid.

Sure you do.

more cryptic hints
about my destiny?

(CHUCKLES) Nice.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.605
And here I thought
I was living on the edge.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.226
SONYA: It seems that
no matter how hard
I try to change things,

22:01.571 --> 22:02.981
that the very corporations
we target

22:03.072 --> 22:04.528
find a way to turn it
to their advantage.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.947
ldidn't think
itwould be like this.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.405
I thought there
would be more outrage.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.485
They feel impotent.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.570
They think what you do
doesn't matter, Sonya.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.239
You're right.

22:18.421 --> 22:19.786
I think what
they need is a leader.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.376
All right. Can I
show you something?

I've been waking up early.

22:26.554 --> 22:29.512
I put in two, three hours,
every day before
the sun's up.

22:42.654 --> 22:43.643
(DOOR OPENS)

22:43.947 --> 22:45.812
ALEC: Julian, you here?
Stay down here.

22:56.793 --> 22:57.828
I just want to talk.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.453
WOMAN: It's not that
I don't appreciate

23:01.548 --> 23:03.334
the pro-active
attention, Detective,

23:03.424 --> 23:06.086
but our trials
will be following
standard procedures.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.926
There's nothing
sinister or unusual
about any of it.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.221
Well, we still may have reason
to believe that Liber8 is
interested in your company.

23:13.851 --> 23:14.840
One more question.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.886
Something that made me
curious in our last visit.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.648
When you were talking
about Alzheimer's,
who was it?

23:23.152 --> 23:24.232
My mother.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.144
I'm sorry, that's tough.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.444
Detective,
where's your partner?

24:12.368 --> 24:13.403
Did you get lost?

24:14.412 --> 24:15.618
Something like that.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.455
Nice stalling.

24:19.542 --> 24:20.748
Thanks.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.746
I'll have the lab put a rush
on this analysis.

24:22.837 --> 24:23.997
Good.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.711
You're out of your mind.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.881
What Sonmanto did
to you was pure
character assassination.

24:29.552 --> 24:30.712
I've got guys like that
on my back, too.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.792
It doesn't have
to be that way.

24:32.764 --> 24:34.595
Look, your HALO thing
sounds like a pipe dream.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.134
It's not.
I promise you.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.683
It's already doing things
that I thought
were impossible.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.682
Can your conscience
wrap itself around
a corporation

24:41.773 --> 24:44.059
that's trying to do good?
'Cause I swear that's
what I'm trying to do.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.644
No, I see why
it's good for you.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.066
I don't see why
it's good for me.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.901
Vice President,
social responsibility.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.729
You write your ticket.

24:52.075 --> 24:54.987
Charity projects,
international development,
brand ambassador?

24:55.578 --> 24:57.569
Your pulpit, Julian,
and I'm gonna pay for it.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.156
Stop talking change
and start making it.

25:02.543 --> 25:03.532
What's this?

25:04.170 --> 25:05.159
A taste.

25:05.630 --> 25:08.588
Having a corporation
working for you,
can be very useful.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.427
It's good to see you.

25:42.792 --> 25:43.872
Well?

25:46.796 --> 25:50.789
Well, it's raw, and, uh,
some of it's pretty rough.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.462
But it's Theseus.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.045
It's me.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.181
I don't appreciate
the summons.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.443
I'm in the middle
ofa case.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.733
KATHERINE: I understand.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.481
Butlhave
a couple of questions.

26:12.822 --> 26:13.811
So do I.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.981
The device I brought you
from the Bregenzer Bank?

26:16.451 --> 26:18.157
lneedit
That's not possible.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.992
That device is of
unknown provenance,

26:20.079 --> 26:21.489
it must remain
in our facility.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.947
Fine.
I'll look at it here.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.372
I see.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.421
I guess we're seeing
the limits of
our partnership.

26:32.717 --> 26:33.832
You have a visitor.

26:35.636 --> 26:36.625
How do you know him?

26:39.223 --> 26:42.431
There was an incident,
approximately 11 weeks ago,

26:42.518 --> 26:44.930
several unexplained
temporal signatures.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.600
So it seems like
we both have something
to investigate.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.222
I'm going to get
back to mine.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.683
My personal life
is off limits.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.606
I promise you,
you don't want
to do this.

26:54.822 --> 26:56.358
Oh, but I kinda do.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.701
Hey, are we gonna
do this or what?

27:10.171 --> 27:12.002
I have a few more
details to get into place.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.370

27:13.716 --> 27:15.297
Don'tjerk me around, Sadler.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.711
Tomorrow, I swear.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.005
Are there gonna be
any questions about
you being late?

27:22.642 --> 27:23.722
Oh, it shouldn't
be a problem.

My supervisor
has a crush.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.017
I haven't had to
scrub a toilet yet.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.560
Okay. Well, keep
coming to work.

27:28.648 --> 27:29.637
Wait for instructions.

27:29.732 --> 27:30.972
In the meantime,
pay attention

27:31.067 --> 27:32.523
for any mention
of clinical trials.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.858
Be invisible,
but see everything.

27:34.946 --> 27:35.981
Okay.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.061
You're smart.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.145
Lucas briefed you
on what to look for

27:38.241 --> 27:39.572
and you know
you're a coup for us.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.282
I know.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.443
I'm hanging a lot on
your daddy issues, kid.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.278
It's more than that.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.791
My father used to talk
about the public like

27:50.878 --> 27:52.459
protecting them was
something sacred.

27:53.589 --> 27:54.669
And now?

27:54.799 --> 27:56.164
He soured on us.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.715
All of us.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.212
You've no idea
how dangerous
your father is.

28:03.266 --> 28:04.722
One day soon,
there'll be
hundreds like him.

28:05.059 --> 28:07.391
They'll be
perfectly insulated,
utterly protected.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.890
Right now he's just
one man drunk on
power and darkness.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.271
It was always there.

28:14.110 --> 28:15.771
Liber8 just revealed
who he really is.

28:20.074 --> 28:21.405
If you betray us,

28:22.451 --> 28:24.407
I will slit your
pretty throat myself.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.075
Now get to work.

28:37.675 --> 28:38.881
It's at the lab now?

28:39.468 --> 28:41.254
Yeah, they promised
the results ASAP.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.632
If it comes back as
Flash or a derivative,

28:44.056 --> 28:46.263
we just have to decide
ifwe move on
Gautuma right away,

28:46.350 --> 28:47.806
or wait and see
what Liber8 does.

28:49.145 --> 28:50.134
We wait.

28:51.647 --> 28:52.636
Liber8's the target.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.096
We've got a solid lead.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.601
Flash was on
the street for weeks.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.351
Anyone could have
acquired a sample
and analyzed it.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.691
There is no evidence
they're linked with Liber8.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.029
Actually, there is.

29:07.914 --> 29:08.994
Your daughter.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.363
What about her?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.706
She's embedded
at Gautuma.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.492
It appears Liber8
placed her there.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.418
They will make a move
sooner or later.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.964
What if pulling her out
tips them off?

29:21.052 --> 29:23.418
It won't.
We'll stash her
in a safe house.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.298
As long as there's
no contact with you,

29:25.389 --> 29:26.674
Liber8 will
assume she ran.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.342
No.

what Liber8 does.

Christine wasn't in
the middle of it,

down that road now.

she shouldn't be
in that position.

my orders, Cameron?

a street drug that comes
straight from Liber8.

it will destroy the company.

to do Liber8's job for them.

sell that Gautuma stock.

that to them?

about this?

36:12.546 --> 36:13.786
I don't care about that.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.590
I am just glad you're safe.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.585
I wanted to get you
something useful.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.250
Some intel, anything.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.797
I'm sorry, I let you down.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.262
That's not possible.

36:27.936 --> 36:28.925
Kiera, are you there?

36:32.024 --> 36:33.013
It's been a while.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.393
Yeah, listen.
I need to see you.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.225
Are you coming
to the send-off?

36:36.945 --> 36:37.980
What send-off?

36:38.364 --> 36:39.729
What, Carlos didn’t tell you?

36:40.074 --> 36:42.110
It’s like a service
for other you.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.032
I'll see you there.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.124
Is there somewhere
we need to be?

36:58.550 --> 36:59.630
Yeah.

37:02.596 --> 37:04.882
CARLOS: Where's the suit?
She didn't know me like that.

37:06.642 --> 37:07.802
What is this place?

37:08.060 --> 37:10.096
It was Escher's
anti-matter lab.

37:10.312 --> 37:11.472
ALEC: You've been
here before?

37:13.065 --> 37:15.397
Right, another timeline.

37:16.735 --> 37:17.850
When the other Alec
came through here,

37:17.945 --> 37:19.310
the machinery was
heavily damaged.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.774
I've been working overtime
to get it up to speed.

37:31.875 --> 37:32.864
KIERA: Alec?

37:32.960 --> 37:34.666
The complete device
allows for modulation.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.501
To choose where
you go in time.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.163
But with these pieces,
and this lab,

37:39.758 --> 37:41.965
there's enough to do
something else.

37:46.432 --> 37:47.592
Okay, I'll need you
both over here.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.727
(DEVICE POWERING UP)

38:01.989 --> 38:03.604
You want to
say something?

38:06.118 --> 38:07.449
You first.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.871
ALEC: Okay, Kiera.

38:10.706 --> 38:11.912
It's hard to say goodbye.

38:15.669 --> 38:16.875
Solong,paﬂner

38:21.508 --> 38:23.169
I'm really happy
you're still here.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.174
Now, I can open the portal,
but I can't set a destination.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.426
It'll annihilate her atoms.

38:31.018 --> 38:35.011
Cast them through time,
she will be everywhere
and every-when.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.062
A Viking funeral.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.517
That's okay, right?

38:48.577 --> 38:49.817
She'd like that.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.418
(MACHINE POWERING UP)

39:14.728 --> 39:15.934
Thanks.

39:16.438 --> 39:17.473
Yeah, don't mention it.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.104
Carlos, give us
a minute?

39:22.110 --> 39:23.270
Yeah, sure.

39:26.782 --> 39:28.113
You think
I don't know?

39:28.534 --> 39:29.614
What?

39:29.743 --> 39:30.778
You dug into her.

39:31.620 --> 39:32.905
You removed the CMR.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.694
This whole thing,

39:34.790 --> 39:36.655
you just trying to
cover up what you did?

39:36.750 --> 39:38.251
Because the Alec Sadler
I know,

39:38.627 --> 39:40.242
the one I met
two years ago,

39:40.712 --> 39:42.543
he would never
have crossed that line.

39:42.631 --> 39:44.371
And you wouldn't have
played on Carlos' grief

39:45.676 --> 39:47.962
The Alec that you met
two years ago is dead.

39:48.387 --> 39:49.627
Or locked away somewhere.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.173
She wasn't using it,

39:51.265 --> 39:52.505
and technically
I did invent it.

39:53.183 --> 39:54.218
Or I Will.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.391
I came because
you called me.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.093
Because Alec Sadler,
my friend,

39:58.188 --> 39:59.769
said he had something
to tell me.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.062
So spit it out,
whatever it is

40:01.149 --> 40:02.559
so that I can get away
from you.

40:02.651 --> 40:04.642
I can't even stand
to look at you right now.

40:10.284 --> 40:11.364
It was nothing.

40:12.953 --> 40:13.942
Goodbye, Alec.

40:35.309 --> 40:37.049
Maybe this
isn't a good idea.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.972
Time is the one thing
I'm sure I don't have.

40:41.815 --> 40:43.521
I can't do it anymore,
I have to know.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.351
Go ahead.

40:50.824 --> 40:52.815
I will be right here
when you, um,

40:54.786 --> 40:55.866
get back.

41:14.473 --> 41:15.462
(GRUNTS)

41:21.605 --> 41:22.594
(INHALES DEEPLY)

41:25.108 --> 41:26.097
(GROANING)

41:36.370 --> 41:37.610
I'm here.

41:39.247 --> 41:40.578
I'm right here.
What did...

41:40.874 --> 41:42.080
What did you see?

41:45.087 --> 41:46.418
My name...

41:49.549 --> 41:51.414
My name is Brad Tonkin.

41:52.636 --> 41:55.673
I'm a field commander
in the Cowichan River militia.

41:57.307 --> 41:58.513
My wife is Melinda.

42:00.894 --> 42:05.354
My daughter is Elenia.

42:06.817 --> 42:08.933
And I know why I came back.
(SOBBING)

42:10.195 --> 42:11.810
It's a one-way trip.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.028
It doesn't have to be.

42:14.741 --> 42:16.572
Your dream,
to get back to Sam

42:16.660 --> 42:19.197
or whatever you
tell yourself is a lie.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.743
It is a lie.

42:20.831 --> 42:22.037
No, no.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.496
No, that is not true.

42:23.583 --> 42:24.743
They're dead!

42:26.586 --> 42:27.621
They're dead.

42:27.713 --> 42:29.294
My wife... My...

42:30.757 --> 42:32.418
My baby.

42:33.719 --> 42:35.459
I watched them die.

42:36.346 --> 42:40.214
Like it was
the first time,
and I felt it happen.

42:41.935 --> 42:42.924
(SOBS)

42:43.395 --> 42:46.011
I felt it happen again!

42:48.859 --> 42:50.065
I'm sorry.

42:51.319 --> 42:52.820
I'm so sorry.

42:57.659 --> 42:59.024
I know why I left.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.584
I volunteered.
