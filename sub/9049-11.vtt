WEBVTT

00:04.340 --> 00:07.175
Guess who has...

00:07.177 --> 00:11.179
Wait, I actually don't have
any big news to announce.

00:11.181 --> 00:12.214
Weird.

00:12.216 --> 00:14.249
Why am I even here?

00:16.219 --> 00:17.953
Because we're friends?

00:17.955 --> 00:19.688
No, that's not it.

00:21.190 --> 00:22.424
Here, I've got news.

00:22.426 --> 00:25.227
Guess who finished a
song for my new album.

00:25.229 --> 00:26.949
- Ooh, let me see it.
- Don't touch my book!

00:28.398 --> 00:30.599
Uh, what's this?

00:30.601 --> 00:32.433
A bookmark Austin made me.

00:32.436 --> 00:35.704
Look, it's got a picture of him
with little hearts instead of eyes,

00:35.706 --> 00:38.373
because he's looking
at me with love.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.777
And that's why I'm
happy being single.

00:41.779 --> 00:44.279
Oh, I remember why
I came in here.

00:44.281 --> 00:45.981
What are you wearing for the
'70s dance party tonight?

00:45.983 --> 00:49.484
Not sure, but I know Austin and Dez
are psyched about their costumes.

00:50.686 --> 00:52.587
Whoo-hoo!

00:55.225 --> 00:56.691
70s party, here we come!

00:57.693 --> 01:00.996
Hey, geezers, it's
a 1970s party.

01:00.998 --> 01:04.666
You dress like you're from
the '70s, not in your 70s.

01:04.668 --> 01:07.602
Huh? I can't hear
you, young lady?

01:07.604 --> 01:09.304
Talk into my good ear.

01:10.768 --> 01:13.608
Well, I guess we better go get some
new costumes after dinner. Let's go.

01:13.610 --> 01:16.311
But dinner? It's only 4:00.

01:16.313 --> 01:18.747
We don't wanna miss the
early bird special.

01:18.749 --> 01:20.882
It's half-price for
senior citizens!

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.356 --> 02:35.524
This is a great
costume idea, Dez.

02:35.526 --> 02:39.327
Yeah, "Groovy goat and the mystery
bunch" is my favorite '70s cartoon.

02:39.329 --> 02:41.396
My favorite character is Reggie.

02:41.398 --> 02:43.999
"Cachoinkers, Groovy.
It's a real whodunnit."

02:45.468 --> 02:48.103
My favorite character is Brenda.

02:48.105 --> 02:50.372
"Hey, guys! It's me, Brenda!"

02:52.708 --> 02:54.509
Brenda really needs a
better catchphrase.

02:55.344 --> 02:58.413
It's so cool that your cousin let
you borrow his goat to play Groovy.

02:58.415 --> 03:01.516
Yeah, too bad we had to smell
him on the ride over here.

03:01.518 --> 03:02.684
What the heck does he eat?

03:02.686 --> 03:05.520
Everything. He's a goat.

03:05.522 --> 03:06.788
Come on, let's dance.

03:06.790 --> 03:08.857
Yeah, I've got disco fever!

03:10.493 --> 03:13.528
Okay, Groovy, will you watch
our stuff for a Groovy treat?

03:15.498 --> 03:17.499
Fine. Two Groovy treats.

03:19.101 --> 03:21.503
Man, he's a good business goat.

03:53.636 --> 03:56.438
Whoo! Disco dancing
really makes me hungry.

03:57.673 --> 04:00.408
Why are you eating Groovy treats?
They're for the goat.

04:00.410 --> 04:03.178
Actually, the package only says
it's recommended for goats.

04:04.447 --> 04:05.914
No, no, no, this
isn't happening!

04:05.916 --> 04:07.097
Ugh, I know.

04:07.128 --> 04:11.850
Someone needs to tell Kevin that wearing
skin-tight bell-bottoms was a bad choice.

04:13.456 --> 04:15.657
No, my songbook is missing!

04:15.659 --> 04:17.591
It was in this bag
and now it's gone!

04:17.594 --> 04:22.130
Cachoinkers, that's horrible! We
have to find out "who dunnit."

04:23.499 --> 04:27.602
Awesome! We get to solve a case,
just like the real mystery bunch!

04:27.604 --> 04:30.472
Well, Groovy saw who took it.
What happened, Groovy?

04:31.541 --> 04:32.641
Uh-huh.

04:33.643 --> 04:34.709
Oh!

04:36.045 --> 04:36.752
I see.

04:36.783 --> 04:39.581
Groovy said to follow him. He
saw which way the thief went.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.917
Really? You got
all that from...?

04:44.620 --> 04:45.287
Uh... yeah!

04:45.318 --> 04:48.990
He also said a few things about your
attitude, but I won't go into that now.

04:48.992 --> 04:50.058
Let's go!

04:59.702 --> 05:01.169
What is this strange place?

05:02.138 --> 05:03.838
It's the school library.

05:05.641 --> 05:07.175
Is it new? I've never
seen it before.

05:08.144 --> 05:11.046
Quiet, this is a library.

05:11.048 --> 05:14.683
And we have a very strict "no
food, drinks, or goats" policy.

05:18.054 --> 05:20.689
Sorry, Mrs. Kravitz. We're
looking for Ally's songbook.

05:20.691 --> 05:21.956
We think someone stole it.

05:21.958 --> 05:26.027
Oh, no, what does it look like?

05:26.029 --> 05:30.131
It is the ultimate manifestation of
love, passion, and every emotion

05:30.133 --> 05:32.667
I've ever felt in my 18 years
on this beautiful earth.

05:33.669 --> 05:35.603
It's a ratty brown book
with an "a" on it.

05:37.106 --> 05:42.877
Oh, I just saw someone run through
here carrying that very same book!

05:42.879 --> 05:44.646
Really? Who was it?

05:44.648 --> 05:47.015
I didn't get a good
look at their face,

05:47.017 --> 05:52.153
but they had a large blond afro
wig and wore a white disco suit.

05:52.155 --> 05:54.089
They were headed
back to the party.

05:54.091 --> 05:55.657
Cachoinkers!

05:55.659 --> 05:57.959
All right, gang, let's go!

05:57.961 --> 05:59.627
Or as my character,
Chaz, would say,

05:59.629 --> 06:02.030
"Let's boogie on out of
here, my funky friends!"

06:05.601 --> 06:11.239
Yeah! Or as my character, Stacy, would
say, "hey, gang! It's me, Stacy!"

06:12.308 --> 06:15.777
Man, they really give the girl
characters the worst catchphrases.

06:22.585 --> 06:27.055
All right, let's see who has a blond
afro wig and a white disco suit.

06:28.657 --> 06:30.258
Go look for clues, Groovy.

06:32.828 --> 06:34.162
Ooh, I found him!

06:34.164 --> 06:37.165
The thief is Chuck! He's
always out to get us.

06:37.167 --> 06:40.168
That's true, he is!
It must be Chuck!

06:40.170 --> 06:43.638
No, look, it's Kimmy
the cheerleader.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.107
Ally beat her out for prom queen
and she still holds a grudge.

06:46.109 --> 06:49.177
That's true, she does!
It must be Kimmy!

06:49.179 --> 06:53.248
No, it's Miles! It's
always the quiet ones.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.250
That's true, he's very quiet!

06:55.252 --> 06:56.286
It must be Miles.

06:56.317 --> 07:00.422
Well, all three are wearing the exact
outfit the librarian described.

07:00.424 --> 07:02.323
So the way I see it, we have...

07:02.325 --> 07:05.794
One... two... three suspects!

07:06.829 --> 07:08.596
Wow, how'd you figure that out?

07:08.598 --> 07:10.932
It's really quite simple. I gave
each suspect a number and...

07:10.934 --> 07:13.101
all right, we get it!

07:13.103 --> 07:15.937
Guys! Someone put
this in my purse.

07:17.807 --> 07:21.776
"I have your songbook. You
have something I want.

07:21.778 --> 07:24.112
I'll tear up a page a
day until I get it."

07:31.787 --> 07:33.154
It's a page from my songbook!

07:33.185 --> 07:36.721
We have to find out who stole it
before there's nothing left of it!

07:37.827 --> 07:42.230
Hmm, so that means the thief must
be strong enough to rip paper.

07:42.232 --> 07:44.399
That narrows it down to...

07:46.702 --> 07:47.802
Three suspects!

07:55.077 --> 07:57.779
I can't believe someone
stole my songbook.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.113
I am so upset.

07:59.115 --> 08:03.218
Ooh, I should write about it in my...
songbook.

08:04.954 --> 08:08.289
But, you see, you can't, Ally.
Because someone stole it.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.061
Let's split up and
investigate each suspect.

08:13.063 --> 08:14.128
Ally and I will take Chuck.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.097
Good idea. I'll go after Miles.

08:16.099 --> 08:18.032
And Groovy and I
will go after Kimmy.

08:18.034 --> 08:19.834
Wait, where's Groovy?

08:23.072 --> 08:26.307
Ooh, Groovy must've discovered
a clue in the popcorn bowl.

08:26.309 --> 08:29.777
Yeah, he discovered
he likes popcorn.

08:37.186 --> 08:39.220
It that Ally's bookmark?

08:51.100 --> 08:52.700
Oops. Sorry.

08:55.738 --> 08:57.839
This is Ally's bookmark!

08:57.841 --> 08:59.140
So you are the thief!

09:09.084 --> 09:10.351
Look, Groovy!

09:13.789 --> 09:15.023
It's the letter "a".

09:16.197 --> 09:20.728
Exactly! The very same kind of letter "a"
from the note Ally got from the thief.

09:20.730 --> 09:23.031
And there's more!

09:23.033 --> 09:24.832
They lead right to a locker.

09:26.937 --> 09:29.103
This just may be Kimmy's locker.

09:33.776 --> 09:35.810
I knew it! Kimmy is the thief!

09:35.812 --> 09:38.379
That evil, menacing, no good...

09:38.381 --> 09:40.915
hey, Dez. Want a
sugar-free cupcake?

09:40.917 --> 09:42.383
Ooh, thanks.

09:44.086 --> 09:45.853
I'm onto you.

10:08.811 --> 10:10.144
That's my new song!

10:10.146 --> 10:12.513
Chuck was singing my new song!

10:12.515 --> 10:14.515
That's great! It's catching on.

10:14.517 --> 10:17.085
No! I haven't released it yet.

10:17.087 --> 10:18.853
It was the one from my songbook.

10:18.855 --> 10:21.122
Which means Chuck is
definitely the thief!

10:21.124 --> 10:24.192
Guys! Miles is
definitely the thief!

10:24.194 --> 10:26.828
Look! He had Ally's bookmark!

10:27.863 --> 10:29.797
Guys! Kimmy is
definitely the thief!

10:29.799 --> 10:31.866
She wrote the ransom
note to Ally!

10:31.868 --> 10:36.070
And she said these cupcakes are
sugar free, but that's a lie.

10:36.072 --> 10:38.039
They just taste way too good.

10:41.243 --> 10:43.945
We need more answers.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.147
Let's put all the
suspects in the same room

10:46.149 --> 10:48.415
and then interrogate them
until someone cracks.

10:48.446 --> 10:52.316
I'll handle it. I have a very gentle way
of coaxing the truth out of people.

10:53.222 --> 10:55.990
One of you lying dirtbags
stole Ally's book

10:55.992 --> 10:59.193
and no one is leaving
until I get a confession!

11:00.562 --> 11:02.864
Hello, Miles. Look familiar?

11:02.866 --> 11:04.932
No. I've never seen it.

11:05.901 --> 11:07.502
Huh?

11:07.504 --> 11:10.304
Your little quiet guy routine
ain't gonna work with me.

11:10.306 --> 11:13.975
Now we can do this the
easy way or the hard way!

11:15.944 --> 11:18.079
Easy way, please.

11:20.616 --> 11:24.152
Look, I don't know why I'm here.

11:24.154 --> 11:25.520
But I didn't do anything wrong.

11:25.522 --> 11:28.256
Um... you didn't, huh?

11:30.492 --> 11:32.894
What about lying about
those cupcakes?

11:32.896 --> 11:34.962
There's no way they
were sugar free.

11:36.965 --> 11:38.599
Dez! Forget about the cupcakes!

11:39.635 --> 11:44.338
Kimmy, what about the cut-out
letters by your locker?

11:47.176 --> 11:48.976
Oh, those?

11:48.978 --> 11:51.045
I used them to make a
collage for spirit week.

11:51.047 --> 11:52.914
Go manatees!

11:57.352 --> 11:59.253
Uh, is this gonna take long?

11:59.255 --> 12:01.189
'Cause I really need
to go to the bathroom.

12:01.191 --> 12:03.291
Sure, Chuck. You can
go to the bathroom.

12:04.493 --> 12:05.893
In jail!

12:05.895 --> 12:08.196
What're you gettin' at?

12:08.198 --> 12:11.232
And, red, why do
you have a goat?

12:14.670 --> 12:17.105
I could ask you the same thing.

12:19.441 --> 12:21.375
You can't, because I
don't have a goat.

12:22.911 --> 12:25.480
Chuck, we heard you singing
Ally's new song earlier.

12:25.482 --> 12:27.615
What? You mean this?

12:27.617 --> 12:29.218
I found it in my locker.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.154
I thought it was a love
song from my sweet Sun Hee.

12:33.156 --> 12:37.925
We broke up again and I thought this was
her loving, tender way of telling me

12:37.927 --> 12:39.360
that she wanted me back.

12:39.362 --> 12:42.096
Well, it wasn't.

12:42.098 --> 12:44.031
This is a song for my new album.

12:46.034 --> 12:49.337
You mean, my sweet Sun Hee

12:49.339 --> 12:51.973
doesn't want to get
back together with me?

13:07.089 --> 13:09.190
Looks like I'm back on
the market, Trish-kabob.

13:11.326 --> 13:14.028
Yeah, that's one market
I'm not shopping in.

13:15.030 --> 13:18.633
So, what do we do now?

13:18.635 --> 13:22.537
Well, we have three...
two... one...

13:22.539 --> 13:23.671
Zero suspects.

13:26.074 --> 13:27.408
Chuck is gone!

13:27.410 --> 13:29.076
He must be guilty.

13:29.078 --> 13:30.444
Let's go find him!

13:41.023 --> 13:43.024
"Come alone to the photo
booth in five minutes

13:43.026 --> 13:46.027
if you ever want to
see your boot again."

13:46.029 --> 13:47.029
My boot?

13:48.064 --> 13:51.299
"Your book. Sorry.
Stupid auto-correct"

13:52.234 --> 13:54.068
don't touch my book!

13:56.171 --> 13:58.439
Oh! Hey!

13:58.441 --> 14:00.541
That's another page
from my songbook!

14:00.543 --> 14:02.109
Oh!

14:03.645 --> 14:05.146
It's you!

14:09.752 --> 14:12.153
Help! Help!

14:12.155 --> 14:15.156
Let me out! I'm trapped!

14:15.158 --> 14:17.024
Help! Let me out!

14:28.605 --> 14:31.506
Dez, your stupid goat led
us to the library again.

14:31.508 --> 14:35.077
Wow, I've been in here
twice in one day.

14:35.079 --> 14:36.712
Look at me, I'm a nerd!

14:39.515 --> 14:42.184
Wait. Where's Ally? I thought
she was right behind us.

14:43.319 --> 14:45.487
Back again I see.

14:45.489 --> 14:48.223
Hey, Mrs. Kravitz, has
Ally been in here?

14:48.225 --> 14:50.659
Oh, I don't know. I
was in the back.

14:51.561 --> 14:54.596
Austin, why don't you and I
search the library for her,

14:54.598 --> 14:59.201
while your two friends and that farm
animal search the rest of the school?

15:01.504 --> 15:03.739
Good idea, really
old librarian lady.

15:03.741 --> 15:05.540
Ally could be in trouble.
There's no time to lose.

15:05.542 --> 15:09.177
You're right. Come on, you stinky animal.
You too, Groovy.

15:18.554 --> 15:20.289
Groovy led us to this trash can.

15:20.291 --> 15:21.704
He must be onto something.

15:21.735 --> 15:25.727
Yeah. He's onto where the buffet
is, Sherlock. Goats love trash.

15:28.377 --> 15:29.498
I thought I heard something.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.466
Guys, help!

15:31.468 --> 15:33.168
All I hear is your stupid goat.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.670
Help!

15:34.672 --> 15:36.438
Quiet, goat!

15:36.440 --> 15:39.241
Trish! Dez! I'm trapped in here!

15:39.243 --> 15:42.177
Wow, Groovy! You sound
just like Ally.

15:42.179 --> 15:44.146
It is Ally.

15:44.148 --> 15:47.482
Cachoinkers, Groovy ate Ally!

15:48.685 --> 15:50.719
Don't worry, Ally,
I'm coming for you!

15:50.721 --> 15:54.289
She's not in the goat, genius,
she's in the photo booth.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.758
Thank goodness you saved me.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.295
You won't believe this. The person
who pushed me in here was...

16:00.297 --> 16:01.363
Who?

16:02.332 --> 16:03.865
I was about to say. It was...

16:03.867 --> 16:06.234
who? Who? I can't
handle the suspense.

16:06.236 --> 16:08.303
I'm trying to tell you.
It was...

16:08.305 --> 16:10.467
why won't you just tell us?

16:10.498 --> 16:13.909
It was Mrs. Kravitz,
the librarian!

16:13.911 --> 16:17.245
Then she must also be the
person who stole your songbook!

16:17.247 --> 16:19.514
Oh, no, Austin's
alone with her now!

16:19.516 --> 16:21.450
We have to save him! Let's go!

16:21.452 --> 16:24.152
One sec. Let me just get some
quick photos with Groovy.

16:36.599 --> 16:38.400
Hello, Austin.

16:38.402 --> 16:41.236
Sorry, Mrs. Kravitz,
you scared me.

16:42.372 --> 16:44.306
I searched the entire library.

16:44.308 --> 16:46.508
Still no sign of Ally,
her songbook, or Chuck.

16:46.510 --> 16:49.911
Aw. Well, I'm sure
they'll turn up.

16:50.913 --> 16:55.217
In the meantime, why not
take a little break?

16:56.486 --> 16:59.621
Uh... I think I'll just
keep looking for Ally.

16:59.623 --> 17:04.726
But I made your favorite...
pancakes.

17:04.728 --> 17:06.461
Ooh, pancakes!

17:07.463 --> 17:09.397
Austin, you're in danger!

17:09.400 --> 17:11.566
We're here to save you
from the mad librarian!

17:12.769 --> 17:14.202
Huh?

17:14.204 --> 17:16.438
Mrs. Kravitz locked Ally
in the photo booth!

17:16.440 --> 17:18.507
And she also stole my songbook!

17:18.509 --> 17:22.544
And she used store-bought pancake mix
instead of making it from scratch!

17:22.546 --> 17:24.346
She's despicable!

17:26.782 --> 17:28.349
She's trying to escape!

18:02.351 --> 18:03.919
Guys, come on!

18:08.591 --> 18:10.292
Oh! We lost her!

18:10.294 --> 18:12.727
Darn you, disco fever!

18:14.464 --> 18:16.331
There she is! Go
get her, Groovy!

18:31.714 --> 18:32.653
Great job, Groovy!

18:32.684 --> 18:35.447
I guess that goat's not
so useless after all.

18:36.686 --> 18:42.357
Okay, I confess. I
stole the book!

18:43.759 --> 18:46.294
Wait a minute. There's something
weird about her face.

18:46.296 --> 18:47.963
They're called wrinkles, Ally.

18:47.965 --> 18:49.831
It's what happens
when people get old.

18:50.766 --> 18:52.667
No, it's a mask!

18:53.416 --> 18:54.936
Now to find out who
the real thief is.

18:54.938 --> 18:55.700
I bet it's Chuck!

18:55.731 --> 18:57.672
- I bet it's Kimmy!
- I bet it's Miles!

18:57.674 --> 18:59.407
I bet it's Channing Tatum!

19:04.313 --> 19:05.067
Brooke!

19:05.098 --> 19:08.083
That's right! And I would've
gotten away with it, too,

19:08.085 --> 19:11.386
if it wasn't for you meddling kids...
and your goat!

19:13.689 --> 19:15.624
Brooke, why did you
steal my book?

19:15.626 --> 19:18.493
Because I knew I could
use it to distract you

19:18.495 --> 19:21.062
and get my beloved
Austin all to myself.

19:22.965 --> 19:25.567
But what about Chuck,
Miles and Kimmy?

19:25.569 --> 19:27.536
They were simply pawns
in my master plan.

19:27.538 --> 19:29.971
I planted Ally's
bookmark on Miles,

19:29.973 --> 19:32.774
used the clippings from Kimmy's
spirit collage for the ransom note,

19:32.776 --> 19:34.976
and stuffed Ally's song
in Chuck's locker,

19:34.978 --> 19:39.614
leading you all on a wild goat
chase, while I stole Austin's heart.

19:43.052 --> 19:44.486
But it didn't work.

19:44.488 --> 19:45.140
But it could have.

19:45.171 --> 19:47.022
- No, it couldn't have.
- Well, it should have.

19:47.024 --> 19:48.723
- But it didn't.
- Says you.

19:50.726 --> 19:52.861
I believe you have something
that belongs to Ally.

19:57.311 --> 19:59.698
Did she hurt you? Mommy's here.
Mommy's here.

20:01.137 --> 20:05.407
Cachoinkers! Another job well done by
Groovy goat and the mystery bunch.

20:05.409 --> 20:06.096
Good job, gang!

20:06.127 --> 20:08.843
Now, let's boogie on out
of here, my funky friends!

20:08.845 --> 20:09.945
Whoo!

20:14.050 --> 20:15.116
Not you.

20:27.496 --> 20:30.532
Did you guys also get a text
saying you won a free fro-yo?

20:30.534 --> 20:32.667
I got that text, too.

20:32.669 --> 20:33.935
Speak up, man!

20:35.938 --> 20:37.839
Hey, guys. We sent
you those texts.

20:37.841 --> 20:39.975
We wanted to apologize
for calling you thieves.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.077
Yeah. It turns out
it was Brooke.

20:42.079 --> 20:43.878
She framed all of you.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.080
She cray-cray.

20:46.415 --> 20:48.483
Well, I wouldn't
call her cray-cray.

20:48.485 --> 20:51.019
She's just a woman in love.

20:51.021 --> 20:54.122
And who wouldn't be in
love with this dream boat?

20:59.729 --> 21:04.065
But just one thing, since you
were innocent, why'd you run?

21:04.067 --> 21:07.068
I told you, I really had to pee.

21:07.070 --> 21:10.839
I drank a lot of punch last night...
lot of punch.

21:12.829 --> 21:14.709
Well, let us make it up
to you with some fro-yo.

21:14.711 --> 21:16.478
Awesome!

21:16.480 --> 21:17.712
Fro-yo rocks!

21:19.815 --> 21:23.551
Sorry, I just get really
excited about frozen yogurt.

21:28.758 --> 21:32.060
After we get our fro-yo, we
can feed it to each other

21:32.062 --> 21:35.897
and then stare into each other's
eyes for hours and hours.

21:38.467 --> 21:39.467
Wait a minute...

21:42.602 --> 21:45.473
Brooke?

21:45.475 --> 21:46.941
Cachoinkers!

21:46.943 --> 21:49.544
Hey, guys, why'd you
leave without me?

21:49.546 --> 21:50.879
Love you. Bye.
