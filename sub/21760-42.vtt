Announcer:
And now back to Thunderbolt .

01:14.670 --> 01:16.540
Look out, Thunderbolt!

01:16.540 --> 01:20.670
Your evil twin
is sneaking up
behind you!

01:20.670 --> 01:23.540
-No matter how many times
I see this rerun,

01:23.540 --> 01:24.960
I can't look!

01:27.920 --> 01:29.500
Newscaster:
We interrupt this program

01:29.500 --> 01:31.750
to bring you an
emergency news bulletin.

01:33.830 --> 01:36.790
Pamela Lee Frizzle,
your one-woman news team,

01:36.790 --> 01:39.250
on the scene
of a major traffic disaster

01:39.250 --> 01:40.750
in downtown Grutely.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.880
Pamela:
And now, an exclusive interview
with the innocent victim

01:46.880 --> 01:49.210
of this senseless tragedy.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.250
-It's Anita.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.920
What's going on?!

01:51.920 --> 01:54.790
Really, Pamela,
one stalled car

01:54.790 --> 01:57.170
is hardly a senseless tragedy.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.120
It is in Grutely.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.790
Now tell us exactly
what happened

02:00.790 --> 02:04.420
after your car screeched
to a terrifying halt.

02:04.420 --> 02:07.710
It didn't screech,
and I wasn't terrified.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.290
I just ran out of gas,
and when I went for help,

02:10.290 --> 02:12.250
I accidentally locked
my keys in the car.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.460
There you have it--
a car, a key,

02:15.460 --> 02:17.580
a careless moment,

02:17.580 --> 02:20.500
and life for this motorist
will never be the same.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.120
And now, let's get some...

02:23.120 --> 02:28.040
exclusive aerial coverage
of the disaster scene.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.290
-Jasper: Look out Horace.
-I'm looking, I'm look--

02:30.290 --> 02:32.210
-Stop looking,
and start stopping!

02:33.420 --> 02:36.120
Yes, the excitement
just keeps building

02:36.120 --> 02:38.710
in Grutely's fast-growing,
major gridlock disaster.

02:38.710 --> 02:41.120
This is Pamela Lee Frizzle

02:41.120 --> 02:43.380
returning you now
to your regular program.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.670
Oh no!
Thunderbolt's over!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.120
We've been robbed.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.500
Well, at least now
we can watch The Gravy Channel.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.210
No way, Rolly.

02:55.210 --> 02:58.210
Anita's car just missed
getting smashed.

02:58.210 --> 03:00.000
We've got to help her.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.120
But tonight
on The Gravy Bunch,

03:02.120 --> 03:04.170
they're taking out the lumps.

03:04.170 --> 03:08.040
Oh, what are we?
Couch dogs or cool dogs?

03:10.250 --> 03:12.420
Uh, can we take a vote?

03:12.420 --> 03:16.210
Lucky's right.
Why watch an adventure
when you can have one?

03:16.210 --> 03:18.210
-Let's go help Anita.

03:18.210 --> 03:21.330
And just how you plan
on doing that, girl?

03:21.330 --> 03:24.380
Huh, good question.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.920
I know, we'll get
their spare keys

03:27.920 --> 03:29.960
hanging in the kitchen
and take 'em to her.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.330
Aww, all the way to Grutely?

03:32.330 --> 03:34.620
That'll take hours!

03:34.620 --> 03:36.920
I know a short cut
through the dairy farm.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.120
Well, now that
they're gone,

03:43.120 --> 03:46.040
we can watch
some real TV.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.000
Announcer:
Now "As the World Churns..."

03:50.000 --> 03:53.120
What?
Sweet little Eloise
broke out of her pasture

03:53.120 --> 03:56.790
and ran off with that
long

03:56.790 --> 03:59.040
How can you
watch that drivel?

03:59.040 --> 04:03.330
Drivel? Girl, have you seen
that Lance Brama?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.750
Whoo!
That's a lot of bull, girl.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.670
You can say that again.

04:07.670 --> 04:11.790
Meanwhile, we're missing
the cheddar cheese awards.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.620
My cousin Queenie
down the road

04:13.620 --> 04:15.210
is getting a golden bucket

04:15.210 --> 04:18.750
for best butter fat performance
in a domestic dairy.

04:18.750 --> 04:22.120
Thank you.
You know, since I was
a little heifer,

04:22.120 --> 04:24.830
I dreamed of making
it big in the dairy biz,

04:24.830 --> 04:27.500
but I couldn't have done it
without the warm fingers

04:27.500 --> 04:28.960
of my milker.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.040
Just wait.
I bet she thanks me next

04:32.040 --> 04:34.040
for all the advice
I gave her.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.250
Ah!

04:36.250 --> 04:38.250
Look!

04:38.250 --> 04:41.120
There's a cow convention
blocking my shortcut.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.000
Hold it, guys.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.540
Hey, who
turned out the lights?

04:53.540 --> 04:56.790
Ah!
Save yourselves!

05:06.170 --> 05:07.500
Turn it off!

05:07.500 --> 05:11.000
-Pesky pups!
-Call the dog catcher!

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Cows:
Mooo-ve them out!

05:17.000 --> 05:19.750
Ladies, please.

05:19.750 --> 05:23.120
This overt hostility
is totally unfeminine.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.920
Calm down before
you curdle yourselves!

05:33.040 --> 05:34.670
Lucky: Just run!

05:37.330 --> 05:39.790
Ooh, this is almost
as exciting

05:39.790 --> 05:43.210
as the time Lance Brama broke up
the Colombian alfalfa cartel.

05:44.790 --> 05:45.920
We interrupt this program

05:45.920 --> 05:48.170
to bring you another
late-breaking news bulletin.

05:48.170 --> 05:51.380
-Oh! Not again!
-Oh, not again.

05:51.380 --> 05:54.920
We are live from
the Greater Grutely
Gridlock Disaster,

05:54.920 --> 05:57.040
where ace locksmith Horace

05:57.040 --> 05:59.330
is attempting to unlock
Anita Dearly's stalled car

05:59.330 --> 06:01.290
by going through the trunk.

06:02.540 --> 06:04.580
Wait a minute,
this just in:

06:04.580 --> 06:06.750
two notorious burglars
have escaped

06:06.750 --> 06:08.620
from Stifle State prison
this morning

06:08.620 --> 06:10.670
and were seen
heading this way.

06:10.670 --> 06:11.920
Lock your doors and windows,

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
and do not confront
these dangerous crooks.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.040
If you see them,
call the Grutely
police department.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.330
And here he is!

06:19.580 --> 06:21.080
Hi, Pop.

06:32.710 --> 06:35.540
I thought they'd
chase us forever.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.920
I'm pooped.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.120
There's no way
I can stagger any further.

06:50.460 --> 06:54.540
-Out of the way, road hog!

07:02.250 --> 07:04.710
Maybe we can catch a ride
on that truck.

07:04.710 --> 07:06.290
Let's do it.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.330
We should have stole
a faster get-away car.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.210
Nah, too suspicious.

07:20.210 --> 07:22.830
This'll get us to Grutely.
We'll rob the bank,

07:22.830 --> 07:24.920
and the cops
won't even notice us.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.880
This is Pamela Lee Frizzle

07:27.880 --> 07:30.120
with another
exciting news update

07:30.120 --> 07:31.790
from the Great Grutely Gridlock.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.500
In attempting
to gain access

07:33.500 --> 07:36.620
to Anita Dearly's car,
well-known locksmith Horace

07:36.620 --> 07:38.710
has locked himself
in the trunk.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.380
Jasper?

07:40.380 --> 07:42.710
Hello

07:42.710 --> 07:44.750
Anybody?

07:44.750 --> 07:47.250
Am I on TV?

07:50.830 --> 07:52.580
Are you listening out there?

07:52.580 --> 07:55.170
We have actual news
right here in Grutely,

07:55.170 --> 07:57.000
and you saw it here first.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.330
And now, an exclusive interview

08:01.330 --> 08:03.330
with Grutely's
leading citizen

08:03.330 --> 08:05.210
Cruella De Vil.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.830
Tell us, Ms. De Vil,

08:08.830 --> 08:11.000
why are you taking money
out of the open vault

08:11.000 --> 08:12.750
in the Grutely Bank?

08:12.750 --> 08:15.040
Well, it's mostly
mine, anyway.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.960
Consider it
a cash withdrawal.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.880
I'll fill out
the tedious forms.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.500
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.330
This'll be the easiest
caper we ever pulled.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.750
Ah, we're riding
with a bunch of crooks!

08:30.750 --> 08:32.580
-Stay down.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.120
We'll figure out
some way to stop 'em.

08:37.380 --> 08:42.040
How can people watch
this namby

08:42.040 --> 08:44.620
-Princess: Hey, put that back.
-Duchess: We were watching that.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.750
Announcer: Attention!
You are watching

08:46.750 --> 08:49.540
the Militaristic Runts Channel,

08:49.540 --> 08:54.500
and now it's time for
"Small Blowhards in Uniform."

09:04.460 --> 09:08.580
We interrupt this program
with an important news flash.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.580
For the first time
in local history,

09:10.580 --> 09:13.380
we are able to bring you
a live broadcast

09:13.380 --> 09:15.460
of a crime in progress.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.210
Just moments ago,
the escaped cons
arrived on the scene

09:18.210 --> 09:20.790
and tied up several
of our leading citizens.

09:20.790 --> 09:23.080
According to Mom,
the Grutely police force

09:23.080 --> 09:25.210
will be here
right after his nap.

09:26.380 --> 09:30.670
Horace:
Help! I need to go
to the little boys' room!

09:30.670 --> 09:31.920
Not now, Horace!

09:31.920 --> 09:34.170
The situation
is too dangerous.

09:34.170 --> 09:37.210
Okay, please hurry.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.920
I mean it.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.460
Hey, the crooks are
stealing Cruella's car

09:43.460 --> 09:44.830
with all the money
from the bank vault.

09:44.830 --> 09:46.710
-We've got to stop 'em.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.120
Oh, right.

09:48.120 --> 09:52.210
We just run 60 miles an hour
and keep yelling, "Halt!"

09:52.210 --> 09:54.830
I've got a better idea.
Come on!

10:04.670 --> 10:05.880
They're headed
out of town!

10:10.710 --> 10:12.670
Rolly, bombs away!

10:28.170 --> 10:30.750
You're under arrest
for prison escape,

10:30.750 --> 10:33.710
bank robbery,
and disturbing my nap.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.790
Don't move
or I'll call out
the Grutely SWAT team.

10:41.620 --> 10:45.040
You know, this was
a lot more fun

10:45.040 --> 10:47.460
than vegging out
and watching TV,

10:47.460 --> 10:49.670
even The Gravy Channel.

10:49.670 --> 10:52.540
Especially
The Gravy Channel!

10:52.540 --> 10:56.170
Pamela:
And thanks to
the heroic efforts

10:56.170 --> 10:58.080
of these four
brave creatures

10:58.080 --> 11:01.330
the most exciting news day
in Grutely history

11:01.330 --> 11:03.540
has come to a happy end.

11:03.540 --> 11:06.500
Hey, how come
they get all the glory?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.540
Maybe 'cause they were
doing something

11:08.540 --> 11:10.960
instead of sitting around
all day watching TV.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.540
All: Nah!

11:15.540 --> 11:17.460
-Give me the remote!
-No!

11:17.460 --> 11:20.120
-Give it to me!
-Try my channel!

11:25.960 --> 11:28.620
Oh, now what
are we supposed to do?

11:28.620 --> 11:30.380
Cow pile!

11:30.380 --> 11:31.830
All right.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.710
-Our snacks on track.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.960
Take cover!

12:02.580 --> 12:03.960
Uncanny.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.830
Spot:
If didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

12:06.830 --> 12:09.960
No wonder you're
named Lucky.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.500
Please, no groveling,

12:11.500 --> 12:14.540
not till after
I whip up dessert.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.580
Oh, man,
that is so cool.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.620
I'd give anything
to have your luck.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.460
Face it, Rolly,
some of us got it,

12:29.460 --> 12:30.670
and some of us don't.

12:30.670 --> 12:33.540
And some of us
are up to our hip boots in it.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.170
Go ahead, Rolly,
rub my horseshoe.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.420
Maybe some of its luck
will rub off on you.

12:40.170 --> 12:42.710
Hey, it is rubbing off.

12:42.710 --> 12:45.460
In totally disgusting clumps.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.670
Time to call
hair club for pups.

12:47.670 --> 12:50.330
Hey, you ruined my horseshoe.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.460
Interesting.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.460
Now it kind of looks
like an enchilada.

12:53.460 --> 12:57.670
To me,
it's more like sunrise
over a dead fly.

12:57.670 --> 13:00.500
Gee, Lucky, I hope
it doesn't change your luck.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.620
Change my luck?

13:01.620 --> 13:04.880
Oh, oh, right, funny.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.540
Cruella:
Oh, too retro.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.920
Too subdued.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.620
Too I-don't-know-what-
I'm-doing-so-I-wore-this.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.330
Sorry, Anita,
your designs are
all rejected.

13:20.330 --> 13:23.540
Luckily, you've got
the whole weekend
to start over.

13:23.540 --> 13:25.120
The weekend?

13:25.120 --> 13:27.710
-But, Cruella--
-Roger: Anita, we're rich!

13:27.710 --> 13:30.710
Overactive Interactive
bought my new computer game,

13:30.710 --> 13:32.670
"Dungeons and Dalmatians."

13:32.670 --> 13:33.880
We're loaded!

13:33.880 --> 13:36.460
Oh, Roger.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.750
That's wonderful.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.460
But I had first refusal
on that game.

13:41.460 --> 13:44.790
And you refused it
six times!

13:44.790 --> 13:47.420
Do you know what this means?

13:47.420 --> 13:50.540
You can quit your job
and we can pay off
the farm's mortgage.

13:50.540 --> 13:53.290
The pups will always
have a good home.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.580
♪ And no more wasted,
worthless, wretched ♪

13:56.580 --> 13:58.040
-♪ working weekends ♪

13:59.210 --> 14:01.540
Drat!
Now I'll never
get their farm.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.580
Memo to myself:
do something about poverty,

14:04.580 --> 14:06.960
keep the Dearlys in it.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.540
In time?!

14:09.540 --> 14:11.750
My horseshoe might
grow back in time?

14:11.750 --> 14:13.790
Now there's nothing
to worry about.

14:13.790 --> 14:16.830
You're growing up,
and a Dalmatian's spots change.

14:16.830 --> 14:19.000
-It's normal.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.540
Luck has nothing
to do with your spots.

14:23.540 --> 14:26.500
You make your luck
by thinking, planning,
and hard work.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.420
Yeah, Dad, thanks.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.420
You're right, I guess.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.750
Lieutenant Pug:
I want to see legs churn.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.920
I want to see ears flap!

14:39.920 --> 14:42.580
I want to see
a new world's record!

14:42.580 --> 14:46.750
Yo, yucky,
the only record you'll set
is for losing!

14:46.750 --> 14:49.540
With Lucky's luck,
he always wins.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.920
Besides, Mooch,

14:50.920 --> 14:53.120
that is not the kind of
pro-social statement

14:53.120 --> 14:55.120
a Bark Brigade cadet
should be modeling,

14:55.120 --> 14:58.330
you inadequate
macho waste of fur.

15:00.580 --> 15:04.120
Charge! Hit the beach!
Geronimo!

15:08.790 --> 15:11.080
Hey, a lucky start.

15:20.830 --> 15:22.790
Oh no!

15:22.790 --> 15:24.580
It's totally gone,

15:24.580 --> 15:26.460
my lucky horseshoe.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.580
And the winner is
Cadet Triplex.

15:40.580 --> 15:45.460
-And the loser is
Cadet Un-Lucky!

15:45.460 --> 15:47.080
Heh, heh, heh.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.790
You should
have consulted me.

15:53.790 --> 15:56.080
If horseshoes
were really lucky,

15:56.080 --> 15:59.080
horses would ride
and people would wear saddles.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.420
Well, so what kind
of lucky charm
does work?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.040
Trust me.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.420
Hello, Mr. Swamp Rat, sir.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.420
We'd like your
very best rabbit's foot.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.580
Should've been here
five minutes ago

16:11.580 --> 16:12.670
before the price went up.

16:12.670 --> 16:15.290
Somehow,
I knew he'd say that.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.620
Lucky will pay
anything you ask.

16:17.620 --> 16:19.210
It's a deal.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.250
Nice bit of negotiating.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.540
You forgot to throw in
my vital organs.

16:24.540 --> 16:27.170
One rabbit's foot
right here.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.420
You didn't tell me
it was attached to a rabbit.

16:39.420 --> 16:41.250
It's a store-wide sale.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.960
More bunny
for your money, sonny.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.000
There must be one somewhere.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.500
There's one!
A four-leaf clover!

16:55.500 --> 16:57.830
I knew I'd
get my luck back.

16:57.830 --> 17:01.040
Lucky, look what you did
to my garden!

17:02.330 --> 17:05.000
Ooh, bad boy!
Bad boy!

17:05.000 --> 17:07.250
You're grounded!

17:07.250 --> 17:08.920
Morning, Nanny, ma'am.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.830
Uh, telephone company sent us
to fix your bad phone line.

17:11.830 --> 17:15.500
What?
Our phones are just fine.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.250
Not when we
get through with them.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.290
-Ow!

17:18.290 --> 17:20.380
It's all part of
the phone company's new policy

17:20.380 --> 17:22.620
"fix tomorrow's
problems today."

17:22.620 --> 17:25.210
And we sent
the bill yesterday.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.420
-That's progress.
-Hm-hmm.

17:27.420 --> 17:30.120
Well, I-I-I can't argue now.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.120
I've got to put
this naughty pup
in solitary,

17:33.120 --> 17:34.580
but listen up.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.290
No funny business.

17:44.170 --> 17:46.210
-Good.

17:46.210 --> 17:49.000
Mr. Dearly's gone.
I can hook this up
to his computer.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.380
We're sure glad
you finally made parole.

17:52.380 --> 17:55.170
Horace and Jasper
just strung some kind of wire

17:55.170 --> 17:57.420
from Roger's computer
over to Cruella's place.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.120
We got to check it out.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.920
Uh, that's okay.
You guys go ahead.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.290
Not without you.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.290
Nobody can come up
with a pro-active,

18:05.290 --> 18:07.620
character-driven solution
like you can.

18:08.790 --> 18:12.250
Uh, all right,
but I'll just be a jinx.

18:23.290 --> 18:26.420
Are we connected
to Raccoon's computer yet?

18:26.420 --> 18:30.750
Yes, ma'am, you'll be able
to play his new computer game
in just a sec.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.250
Play it?
I'm going to ruin it

18:33.250 --> 18:36.120
by sending this
unstoppable virus

18:36.120 --> 18:39.120
over that wire
from my computer
to his.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.920
When I'm done with it,
no computer company in the world

18:41.920 --> 18:44.040
will buy his blasted game!

18:44.040 --> 18:46.250
Lucky, what do we do?

18:46.250 --> 18:49.290
-Don't ask me.
-Maybe we can cut
that wire,

18:49.290 --> 18:51.210
and stop
the unstoppable virus.

18:51.210 --> 18:52.250
Come on!

19:04.170 --> 19:06.330
Puppies?
Get them out of here!

19:06.330 --> 19:08.210
They'll spoil my plans!

19:09.460 --> 19:11.040
This way!

19:41.750 --> 19:44.250
Chase them into this cage,
you twits!

19:54.210 --> 19:56.040
Now back to work.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.750
We'll take care of those
flee-infested intruders

19:58.750 --> 20:01.170
after I've dealt
with Rumple-meyer.

20:01.170 --> 20:03.170
It's all my fault.

20:03.170 --> 20:05.790
If I hadn't lost my good luck,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

20:05.790 --> 20:07.080
Oh, get off it.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.500
I hate it
when you're whiny
and insecure.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.830
That's my shtick.

20:10.830 --> 20:13.500
Everyone makes their luck,
you especially.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.080
-When you got that steak
from the meat truck,

20:16.080 --> 20:18.120
that wasn't luck.
That was planning.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.120
You watched
every day for week

20:20.120 --> 20:22.040
until you knew the exact time
it would hit that bump.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.620
Well, yeah, I guess I did.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.750
Then you had
a really cool idea,

20:26.750 --> 20:28.380
using your collar
for a boomerang.

20:28.380 --> 20:30.960
And you kept practicing
until you were an expert.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.170
It had nothing
to do with luck.

20:33.170 --> 20:34.540
That's it.

20:34.540 --> 20:37.000
Your collar!
You can use it
to get us out.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.540
Look, hit that switch
and the door will open.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.000
Nah, I'd never be
that lucky.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.620
Ah, sure you could.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.420
Cadpig:
You got to try!

20:46.420 --> 20:48.040
Spot: Just do it!

20:50.290 --> 20:51.710
-Cruella: There.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.880
I've transmitted
the unstoppable virus
into Roger's game.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.330
Huh? I don't remember
programming those effects.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.210
All right!

21:02.210 --> 21:05.000
-You did it!
-I knew you had it
in you, kid.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.880
Okay!

21:06.880 --> 21:08.170
Now to finish the job.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.330
And now for step two,

21:10.330 --> 21:13.380
total viral infestation.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.040
Play this
in your game, Rag Bag!

21:21.040 --> 21:23.790
It'll blow up
every computer
it touches.

21:29.670 --> 21:32.040
So much for user-friendly.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.920
No, sorry.
I don't want to ship you
the game yet.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.460
If you think
it's great now,
just wait.

21:38.460 --> 21:42.080
I have got some exciting
new ideas for graphics
that'll bowl you over.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.080
I'll call you
in a couple of months.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.960
Yeah, I guess
you were right, Spot.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.080
It's all about
using your head
and being ready.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.580
-Now, let's get lucky.

22:00.040 --> 22:03.960
Lucky, your horseshoe spots
are coming back.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.210
Oh, yeah, who needs 'em?

22:06.210 --> 22:08.080
When I want luck,

22:08.080 --> 22:09.460
I make it.
