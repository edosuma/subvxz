WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:06.441
Yeah, don't worry, Tunde,
she doesn't suspect a thing.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.269
Yeah, I know it's 6:30.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.184
I'll get her there
as soon as I can.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.273
Well, if you're hungry,
have a snack.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.015
I don't know, cheese.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.929
She's coming. Bye.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.236
What happened? Why are you
wearing your pajamas?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.369
I don't feel like going
to Auntie and Uncle's tonight.

00:21.412 --> 00:24.285
Well, we can't always do
what we feel. Let's go.

00:24.328 --> 00:27.070
I'm tired.
I'll call and reschedule.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.593
No. I forbid it.

00:28.637 --> 00:31.770
Very funny, Bob.
- Come on.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.555
You can't cancel.
They're elders.

00:33.598 --> 00:34.904
I thought you had to
follow their commands

00:34.947 --> 00:36.166
like little
Nigerian robots.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.820
Well, this robot is sleepy.

00:37.863 --> 00:40.040
I'm sorry. The last thing
Tunde said to me was,

00:40.083 --> 00:43.347
"I
order Abishola to be at dinner."

00:43.391 --> 00:45.175
Fine.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.003
But do not ever
do that voice again.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.744
Deal. Go, go, go.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.362
Why are they having us over
on their bingo night?

00:58.406 --> 01:00.016
It got cancelled.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.714
- Why?
- Because...

01:02.758 --> 01:04.020
there was a fire.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.021
Fire?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.544
Everyone's fine,

01:06.588 --> 01:08.938
just all the little
bingo balls melted.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.114
Can't they just get new balls?

01:11.158 --> 01:13.508
Factory's closed.

01:13.551 --> 01:14.944
The factory is closed?

01:14.987 --> 01:17.512
Yeah, another fire.

01:17.555 --> 01:20.515
You now, they haven't said,
but I think they're connected.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.125
What is going on?

01:22.169 --> 01:25.346
Nothing. I'm just excited
to get to Olu and Tunde's

01:25.389 --> 01:27.522
as soon as possible.

01:32.614 --> 01:36.052
Welcome to dinner,
and only dinner.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.010
She knows something's up.

01:38.054 --> 01:40.752
What could be worth going
through all this nonsense for?

01:40.796 --> 01:43.364
<i>E kasaan,</i> Mum.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.192
- Dele?
- Surprise!

01:45.235 --> 01:47.629
Oh, Dele, my baby boy.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.326
I've missed you so much.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.936
I've missed you, too.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.677
I don't understand.
How did you get here?

01:52.721 --> 01:56.464
Abishola, I see you have gained
weight since the wedding.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.729
Surprise.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.189
How is the stew?

02:26.233 --> 02:28.496
So hot it could strip paint.

02:28.539 --> 02:32.195
My sister will still say
it is bland. Add more pepper.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.197
Don't worry, Auntie,

02:34.241 --> 02:36.417
everything is going
- to be delicious.
- It better be.

02:36.460 --> 02:39.811
Otherwise, she will blame me,
and I will blame you.

02:39.855 --> 02:40.986
I've missed you.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.728
I missed you, too.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.644
Okay, enough.
Put this love in the food.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.258
I still cannot believe
you're here in Detroit.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.912
It was nice
to finally be invited.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.088
You're always
invited, Mummy.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.700
Well, this invite included
a first-class ticket.

02:58.743 --> 02:59.701
Thank you, Bob.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.398
You're very welcome.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.140
Although, it would have been
nice to know you were coming

03:04.184 --> 03:05.750
ahead of time.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.883
That would've ruined
the surprise.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.798
Yes, it would have.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.756
Mummy, would you like

03:11.800 --> 03:13.628
to visit the hospital
and see where I work?

03:13.671 --> 03:15.412
- Are you a doctor yet?
- No.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.414
I will visit
when you are a doctor.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.638
But I would love to see
Bob's sock empire.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.771
Well, I wouldn't call it an
empire. It's more of a kingdom.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.686
Happy to have you visit.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.775
Tunde,

03:30.819 --> 03:33.038
that was your second trip
to the bathroom.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.692
Ah, too much ginger ale.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.607
Or it could be your prostate.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.218
Nonsense, Ebun.

03:38.261 --> 03:41.830
My prostate is strong.
My stream is mighty.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.401
She knows about
my prostate problem.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.446
How?

03:49.490 --> 03:52.275
She sniffs out our weaknesses
like a bloodhound.

03:52.319 --> 03:55.104
She is all-knowing,

03:55.147 --> 03:57.149
and all-judging.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.282
The worst part is,

03:59.326 --> 04:02.720
I have to pee again.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.248
Welcome, Ebun.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.250
Thank you, Dottie.
I've brought you a gift.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.468
Dele.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.948
Yes, Granny?

04:12.991 --> 04:14.819
You are the gift.
Hug your grandmother.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.474
Aw. Come here, Dele.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.955
- Nice to see you again.
- Do I get to keep him?

04:19.998 --> 04:22.087
No.

04:22.131 --> 04:24.220
Mummy, I'm sorry the
house is such a mess.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.657
No need to apologize.
Just clean it.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.312
Bob, help her.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.792
The cleaning lady
was here this morning.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.750
Are you talking back
to your mother?

04:32.794 --> 04:34.361
I was, but I'll stop.

04:36.493 --> 04:39.409
Oh, this is gonna be fun.
Can I get you a drink?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.237
Please, allow me.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.891
Abishola,
get us drinks.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.675
- Bring them out
to the hot tub.

04:44.719 --> 04:48.288
Ebun and I are gonna
soak our tootsies.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.030
I hope you are enjoying
your surprise.

04:52.074 --> 04:55.207
You better make this
- a hell of a visit, kid.
- Yeah.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.690
And we put your desk
by the window.

04:59.734 --> 05:00.952
I hope you like it.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.650
It's great.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.652
Um, what are these?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.262
Oh, whenever I read
an article

05:06.306 --> 05:07.655
that made me think of you,

05:07.698 --> 05:09.352
I saved it so you could
read it, too.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.920
Oh, there's so many.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.617
I thought about you a lot.

05:13.661 --> 05:17.229
This one is about
a dance troupe in Ghana.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.927
And this one is about

05:18.970 --> 05:21.495
how terrible
the Detroit Pistons are.

05:21.538 --> 05:22.931
Did you know they were so bad?

05:22.974 --> 05:26.064
Yeah, I knew.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.371
You should think about
following a team that wins.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.286
I think about it every season.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.682
I'm so glad
you are here.

05:34.725 --> 05:37.032
Even if it is just
for a little while.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.426
- Me too.
- And remember,

05:39.469 --> 05:42.385
no matter how far you go
or how long you are gone,

05:42.429 --> 05:43.865
this is your home,

05:43.908 --> 05:45.910
and it alwayswill be.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.609
All right, Dele, scram.
Granny wants our room,

05:48.652 --> 05:50.915
so we're sleeping
in here tonight.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.395
Enjoy the couch.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.136
You can visit
your room tomorrow.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.573
Welcome home, bud.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.103
Everyone, we have
a special guest today.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.888
All the way
from Lagos, Nigeria,

06:06.931 --> 06:09.934
my beautiful mother-in-law,
Ebunoluwa Odegbami.

06:09.978 --> 06:12.154
Give her a big
MaxDot welcome.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.984
What the hell's
a MaxDot welcome?

06:16.027 --> 06:17.855
Clap and bow.
Clap and bow.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.248
Clap and bow!

06:28.083 --> 06:29.954
The workers are very obedient.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.565
I like it.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.958
Yeah, we got a good group.
Award-winning.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.396
We got Detroit's
Top Garment Manufacturer

06:36.439 --> 06:38.789
five out of the last six years.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.793
What happened in 2018?

06:42.837 --> 06:44.534
You know, that's
the same thing Abishola said

06:44.578 --> 06:46.449
when she first came here.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.930
Mummy, Bob also got
Businessman of the Year.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.453
Only one?

06:50.497 --> 06:52.150
Oh, I'm sure it'll be
the first of many.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.151
Good.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.892
Thanks, kid.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.459
Now, if you'll all wait here,

06:56.503 --> 06:59.157
I've got something
special for Mama Ebun.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.595
He is a good man, Abishola.

07:01.638 --> 07:02.813
Thank you.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.554
Also, you should
know my bed

07:04.598 --> 07:06.295
was very uncomfortable
last night.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.036
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.864
Would you like some
- different pillows?
- No.

07:09.907 --> 07:12.040
I just wanted you to know
your bed was a failure.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.172
Special delivery.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.610
Mama, you remember
my brother Douglas?

07:16.653 --> 07:18.133
I do not.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.178
I was the other white guy
at the wedding.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.266
Oh, yes.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.486
The drunk one.

07:23.530 --> 07:26.315
I think it was
the altitude.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.186
And, to be clear, I was high.

07:28.230 --> 07:32.190
And-and Kofo here just got
moved up to head of marketing.

07:34.366 --> 07:37.892
Ah, I see you are smart enough
to have promoted a Nigerian man.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.415
I thought you'd
like that.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.199
I think you're gonna
like this even more.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.768
A bouquet for you.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.162
Notice that each sock flower
is a women's medium.

07:47.205 --> 07:49.947
Thank you, Bob.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.515
My family back home
will be jealous.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.604
Well, that's who those
other boxes are for.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.520
If I give them socks,

07:57.564 --> 07:59.740
how would they
be jealous of mine?

08:00.958 --> 08:03.483
- You're right. They're all yours.
Wonderful.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.224
Thank you for such
a lovely greeting.

08:06.268 --> 08:09.271
Should I expect more surprises
at your other factories?

08:09.314 --> 08:11.055
What's that?

08:11.099 --> 08:13.884
Mummy, this is MaxDot.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.974
Yes, I know
this is the original building.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.020
Surely, after 25 years,

08:19.063 --> 08:21.109
Bob has expanded
to other factories.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.328
Well, I haven't
really needed to.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.766
Wh-What Mr. Wheeler
is saying is

08:25.809 --> 08:28.246
we do not have enough business
to justify other warehouses.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.944
Thanks for helping, Kofo.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.341
This is nice.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.301
I like being a tourist
in our own town.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.999
Did you hear all that stuff
she was saying about MaxDot?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.697
- She likes your company.
- You mean,

08:43.740 --> 08:45.873
my teeny, tiny company?

08:45.916 --> 08:48.092
Bob, look.

08:48.136 --> 08:51.269
Now, here is a businessman.

08:51.313 --> 08:55.099
As if cars were not enough,
Henry Ford also

08:55.143 --> 08:57.232
built airplanes
to help his country.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.843
He also hated unions
and was an anti-Semite.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.366
Is that on there?

09:01.410 --> 09:02.846
- Bob.
- Just asking.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.326
Well, do not worry.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.329
In ten years,
with an improved mindset,

09:07.372 --> 09:08.765
you could be
the Henry Ford of socks.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.943
In ten years, I'm gonna
be on a boat, on a lake.

09:12.987 --> 09:13.988
You are planning to retire?

09:14.031 --> 09:15.729
Oh, yeah.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.383
So, you are satisfied
with what you have accomplished?

09:18.427 --> 09:19.384
I am.

09:19.428 --> 09:20.995
Interesting.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.693
I assumed you were
a more ambitious man.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.478
I'm plenty ambitious.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.655
I met your daughter
because I worked myself

09:28.698 --> 09:30.613
- into a heart attack.
- And it was nearly fatal.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.832
Thank you.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.399
Mr. Ford had several

09:34.443 --> 09:37.272
heart attacks and a stroke.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.796
Mummy,
Bob is a very hard worker.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.798
He kept a small business alive

09:41.842 --> 09:43.670
in Detroit when so many
others went bankrupt.

09:43.713 --> 09:44.801
That's right.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.411
Of course he could work harder,

09:46.455 --> 09:48.805
and his business could
be more successful,

09:48.849 --> 09:51.765
- but he's fine with it.
- Wait, what?

09:51.808 --> 09:53.462
You thought you were
marrying Henry Ford,

09:53.505 --> 09:55.159
instead you get Edsel.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.379
- Who is Edsel?
- Henry Ford's son.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.816
He inherited the business and
didn't really do much with it.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.296
I'm not Edsel.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.689
Says here he loved boats, too.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.604
See? Edsel.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.608
I'm not Edsel!

10:14.048 --> 10:15.789
It's only two weeks.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.834
We can survive
two weeks.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.619
This is who I am.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.882
- What?
- William Clay Ford.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.710
Clay took over when Ford
was on the ropes

10:23.753 --> 10:26.016
and kept it afloat,
just like me and MaxDot.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.889
Bob, do not listen
to my mother.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.368
Well, what about you--
do you think

10:30.412 --> 10:32.109
I could have done more
with the company?

10:32.153 --> 10:34.068
Bob.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.547
Do not listen
to my mother.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.115
Got it.
Edsel hears you loud and clear.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.030
You are not Edsel.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.293
You are Bob Wheeler,
my husband.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.382
A brilliant
and talented man

10:44.426 --> 10:46.863
who can accomplish
anything he puts his mind to.

10:46.907 --> 10:49.692
You have made your choices,
and I'm happy with it,

10:49.736 --> 10:50.954
as long as you are.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.827
That was very nice. Thank you.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.528
But the headline is
I could've done more!

11:08.755 --> 11:10.408
Ah, good morning,
everyone.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.453
Good morning.

11:11.496 --> 11:12.846
You're all up early.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.456
Well, when you
sleep on the couch,

11:14.499 --> 11:16.197
you get to wake up
when everyone else does

11:16.240 --> 11:18.982
and make them breakfast.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.028
I'm still adjusting
to the time change.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.986
And I had a cup of coffee
four days ago,

11:23.030 --> 11:24.684
so I'll never sleep again.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.947
Don't get old, kid.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.426
You are not old.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.254
Oh, what a sweetie.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.821
Go get five dollars
out of my purse.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.261
Where's Bob?
Still in bed.

11:37.305 --> 11:40.134
Hmm. I'm surprised
a company president

11:40.177 --> 11:41.962
can sleep in on a weekday.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.703
Because Bob trains
his employees well,

11:43.746 --> 11:45.139
and they can take care
of anything that comes up.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.836
That's wonderful,

11:46.880 --> 11:50.318
so he can sleep in
and dream of his little boat.

11:50.361 --> 11:51.711
Big boat.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.321
He's already got
the name picked out,

11:53.364 --> 11:54.757
<i>Socks to Be You.</i>

11:54.801 --> 11:56.237
Get it?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.717
No.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.415
Bob works very hard, Mummy.

12:00.458 --> 12:04.332
Of course he does.
Just not today, apparently.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.464
Mummy, please.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.423
What? Am I telling lies?

12:08.466 --> 12:10.773
Bob does not deserve
to be spoken about this way.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.210
And I do not deserve this tone.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.430
Am I not still your mother?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.954
Yes, you are.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.959
You are also insulting
my husband in our home,

12:23.003 --> 12:25.222
and I will nothave it.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.051
How dare you speak
to me this way?

12:28.095 --> 12:30.401
Dele, pack your bag.
We are going back

12:30.445 --> 12:31.881
- to Nigeria.
- Dele.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.404
Stay right where you are.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.798
Go pack.

12:35.842 --> 12:39.323
Do not move.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.589
How are you not nuts?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.466
I think this is
the last one.

12:51.509 --> 12:52.989
Thank you, Tunde.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.296
You have rescued me
from a nightmare.

12:55.339 --> 12:58.125
We are all in the same dream.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.822
I could not

12:59.866 --> 13:02.129
spend another minute
in that house.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.827
I'm sure Abishola is sorry
for what she said.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
It is too late for apologies.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.875
I will never speak to her again.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.877
I'm just worried
that Abishola

13:10.920 --> 13:13.401
will not be able to see
how furious you are

13:13.444 --> 13:16.230
if you are staying here.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.493
- She knows.
- Ah, oh, but

13:18.536 --> 13:21.539
wouldn't it be more clear
if you were at Bob's house

13:21.583 --> 13:24.978
parading your anger
in front of her?

13:25.021 --> 13:26.762
Sister,

13:26.806 --> 13:28.677
this is your first time
in America.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.420
Do not spend it fighting with a
daughter you barely get to see.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.075
I do not want to, but she
has given me no choice.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.338
You insulted
her husband.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.427
She was just
- standing up for him.
- Eh, eh!

13:39.470 --> 13:41.864
Are you saying
this is my fault?

13:43.387 --> 13:46.129
Tunde, get my things,
I am leaving.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.739
Where will you go?

13:47.783 --> 13:50.394
Uh, perhaps
to a hotel.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.483
You can use my Hilton points.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.616
You are right, Olu.
I will stay here.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.882
But, until everyone apologizes,

13:59.926 --> 14:01.884
I am only speaking to Tunde.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.320
- Fine.
- Fine.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.974
Fine.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.851
And I told her to never speak
about my husband that way.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.983
Did you say that in your head
or out loud?

14:14.027 --> 14:16.377
Out loud. <i>Oluwa mi o.</i>

14:16.420 --> 14:19.293
You spoke up for your
husband, good for you.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.424
Not good for her.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.991
Husbands come and go,

14:22.035 --> 14:24.298
mothers are forever.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.995
And now she's
not speaking to me.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.867
- Have you tried groveling?
- No.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.172
I would start there.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.000
Hold on,

14:31.044 --> 14:33.611
maybe she should see
where this goes.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.135
What are you talking about?

14:35.178 --> 14:38.007
She just created a boundary
with her mother.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.791
That's every
daughter's dream.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.664
How did it feel?

14:42.707 --> 14:45.058
In the moment, exhilarating.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.755
Like jumping out of a plane.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.977
But you do realize you are now
plummeting towards the earth

14:51.020 --> 14:52.630
with no parachute.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.632
Come on, it's not that serious.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.025
Have you ever talked back
to your mother?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.244
Hell no.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.941
That's why
I want to see

14:58.985 --> 15:00.987
where this thing goes.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.382
Thank you all
for coming.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.297
Happy to be here, Bob.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.518
Wait a minute, I thought
you don't work here anymore.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.390
I don't, but as a stakeholder
in this company,

15:13.434 --> 15:15.305
Bob requested that
I be at this meeting.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.873
Wait, we don't have to work here
to have a stake in the company?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.441
In that case,
I also have an announcement.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.316
I've done this company
a disservice.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.535
All these years
I've been settling

15:27.578 --> 15:28.753
for staying
in business,

15:28.797 --> 15:30.233
instead of pushing us to live up

15:30.277 --> 15:31.713
to our full potential,

15:31.756 --> 15:32.932
and I'm sorry.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.936
You're apologizing
for keeping us afloat?

15:36.979 --> 15:39.677
Apology accepted.

15:39.721 --> 15:40.983
Look, I'm serious.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.942
We had chances
to expand,

15:42.985 --> 15:44.726
open more factories.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.424
I was too scared to take
the risk, but not anymore.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.425
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying

15:48.469 --> 15:50.036
let's make some moves,

15:50.079 --> 15:52.125
push our chips all in,
and see what happens.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.563
That is really bold, Bob.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.087
I'm out.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.524
I haven't even
told you my plan.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.787
Why don't you just
push your chips in,

16:02.831 --> 16:05.181
and if it goes good, then
we get some of your new chips.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.401
Oh, my gosh.
That's a great idea.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.402
Guys.

16:08.445 --> 16:09.620
We can do this.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.144
We could take MaxDot global.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.667
Honey, what's going on?

16:12.710 --> 16:15.235
I just feel like
I could do more.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.888
You've done plenty.
You took over a business

16:16.932 --> 16:18.586
that was barely hanging on,

16:18.629 --> 16:21.328
in a city that had already
let go, and you made it work.

16:21.371 --> 16:24.984
No layoffs for 25 years, and
that was through two recessions.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.333
That's an achievement.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.944
No, that's just the beginning.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.033
I'm not so sure
- about that, Bob.
- I don't know.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.730
You're sounding
really strange... Okay, can I just say something?

16:32.774 --> 16:34.036
Please.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.082
Motion to freeze
company assets

16:36.125 --> 16:37.170
and suspend
any new business.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.823
Seconded.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.696
You need three-quarters
of the board to do that.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.831
Oh, my God.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.051
You're the Edsels.

16:50.531 --> 16:51.793
I don't know
what that means.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.588
Tunde, ask my sister

17:04.632 --> 17:06.068
if she wants more stew.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.071
Ebun, would you like more stew?

17:09.115 --> 17:11.117
Tell my sister,
no, thank you.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.249
The stew was inedible.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.775
She said, "No, thank you."

17:17.819 --> 17:19.299
Please

17:19.342 --> 17:20.735
ask my sister

17:20.778 --> 17:23.520
why she devoured two bowls.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.392
She said...

17:25.435 --> 17:27.959
"You seem to like it."

17:28.003 --> 17:30.788
Tell her I did not, but

17:30.832 --> 17:32.703
our parents raised us
to be polite.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.576
She obviously
has forgotten that.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.102
Tell her.
Yes, tell me, Tunde.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.669
I am done with this.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.672
- That is not what she said.
- If you need me,

17:44.715 --> 17:46.065
I am taking a walk

17:46.108 --> 17:48.719
to the Downtown Hilton!

17:51.157 --> 17:52.810
What is wrong with him?

17:52.854 --> 17:55.987
He has been very moody lately.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.467
I think it is his prostate.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.816
I knew it.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.470
More stew, Sister?

18:00.514 --> 18:02.037
Oh, yes, please.
