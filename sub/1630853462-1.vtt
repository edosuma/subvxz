01:14.857 --> 01:16.685
South Texas Radio.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.121
Welcome back.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.818
I have to tell
all of you listeners,

01:19.992 --> 01:22.778
in case you haven'’t
already heard about this,

01:22.952 --> 01:24.649
and this one'’s a doozy.

01:24.823 --> 01:28.392
The State of Texas is releasing
a convicted murderer

01:28.566 --> 01:30.699
by the name of Neto Niente,

01:30.873 --> 01:35.356
straight off of death row
and back onto our streets.

01:35.530 --> 01:39.882
It seems that
an overzealous state trooper
by the name of Robert Cuaron

01:40.056 --> 01:41.623
planted a key piece of evidence

01:41.797 --> 01:44.104
that led to Niente'’s
conviction.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.844
Well, shortly before his death,

01:46.018 --> 01:48.020
the trooper confessed
to planting this evidence.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.545
Now, let me tell you folks,

01:51.459 --> 01:54.070
this Niente is the kind of guy

01:54.244 --> 01:56.377
who should be locked away
for good.

01:56.551 --> 01:58.857
His gangster associates
called him The Jesuit

01:59.031 --> 02:00.685
in some sick reference

02:00.859 --> 02:02.644
to the fact
that certain Jesuits

02:02.818 --> 02:05.473
performed torture during
the Spanish Inquisition.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.258
It is only a matter of time

02:08.432 --> 02:10.782
before something
truly awful happens.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.221
Callers, I want to know
what you think.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.787
Crystal in Laredo.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.528
This fella
does sound pretty bad,

02:17.702 --> 02:19.487
but one sin
does not justify another,

02:19.661 --> 02:21.750
especially by the authorities.

02:21.924 --> 02:25.275
In the end, it will be God who
will pass judgment on this guy.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.712
I hope you'’re right.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.323
Jose in Corpus Christi.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.847
I don'’t care
if he rots in prison.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.197
This guy, he just makes
my people look bad.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.286
I really have
no sympathy for him.

03:03.444 --> 03:04.749
These boots.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.491
A bag of clothes.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.320
I'’m sure
I'’ll see you again.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.575
Counselor.

03:49.751 --> 03:50.882
Neto.

03:54.669 --> 03:55.800
Brought you a hat.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.894
Where do you want to go?
Let'’s get out of here.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.469
So, your stuff'’s
in the back there.

04:13.514 --> 04:15.037
Well, you'’ve got
about 30 grand-ish.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.865
Plus your passport.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.260
Speaking of which,
I'’ve got something for you.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.523
There you are.

04:24.351 --> 04:27.005
That'’s got all
the latest shit on it,
that has.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.443
You won'’t believe
that fucking thing.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.838
How'’d you get Cuaron
to change his testimony?

04:34.839 --> 04:36.624
Well, as you know,
six months ago,

04:36.798 --> 04:39.714
he discovered he'’s got
cancer of the asshole.

04:39.888 --> 04:43.500
He says, "God, what have
I done to deserve this?"

04:43.674 --> 04:45.415
He can'’t sit.
He can'’t take a shit.

04:45.589 --> 04:48.418
So his wife says,
"Roberto, my love,"

04:48.592 --> 04:52.204
she says, "You must
confess your sins."

04:52.379 --> 04:54.772
She says, "When you'’re
standing at the pearly gates,

04:54.946 --> 04:57.514
God is gonna look directly
into your soul, right?

04:57.688 --> 04:59.386
He'’s going to see
all your secrets,

04:59.560 --> 05:01.431
and he'’s gonna
judge you."

05:01.605 --> 05:04.434
So he says,
"Cecilia, you'’re right.

05:04.608 --> 05:07.829
Tomorrow,
I will go down to the police
and I will confess all my sins."

05:08.003 --> 05:10.527
And I said, "Hold on a minute."
I said, "Hold on a minute."

05:10.701 --> 05:13.356
Tomorrow, when I come by
with his medicine,

05:13.530 --> 05:17.012
I'’ll bring along a judge
to take down his statement,
which is what I done.

05:17.186 --> 05:20.363
And now,
Robbie'’s soul is at rest.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.410
A week later, he was
in the arms of St. Peter,
thank you very much.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.937
You know you got
no restrictions on you,
right?

05:29.111 --> 05:31.418
No parole,
no supervision.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.245
You can go wherever
you fucking want,

05:34.159 --> 05:35.465
but in Texas,

05:36.814 --> 05:38.425
they don'’t forget
the fucking Jesuit.

05:40.514 --> 05:43.212
Not the police.
As far as they'’re concerned,
you took one of their own.

05:43.386 --> 05:46.868
And certainly
not the fucking cholos.
You'’re fucked there.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.218
You was an enforcer.
You made enemies.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.133
They fucking remember you.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.570
If I was you,
I'’d fuck right off.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.442
There'’s just one thing
I got to do first.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.923
What'’s that?I have to see my son.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.981
Police!

07:46.378 --> 07:49.381
Well, well, well.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.340
Wall hasn'’t changed you.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.777
Haven'’t changed you at all,
have they?

07:55.866 --> 07:57.215
Mama always said,

07:57.389 --> 07:59.696
"Never kick a fresh turd
when it'’s hot out."

08:01.176 --> 08:02.177
But it'’s been raining.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.621
Your ball-sucking lawyer

08:11.795 --> 08:15.756
may have manipulated Cuaron
into changing his testimony.

08:15.930 --> 08:19.586
Lord knows you'’ve sinned.
You'’ve sinned plenty.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.981
We'’re gonna be
watching you closely, boy,
that'’s for goddamn sure.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.532
Yes?

09:46.760 --> 09:47.848
Hi.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.156
You should have called.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.768
May I come in?

09:56.117 --> 09:57.553
Look at you.

09:57.727 --> 10:01.513
You are nothing but trouble.
What do you want?

10:04.647 --> 10:05.953
I'’d like to see my son.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.391
No. He'’s not here.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.915
You need to leave.

10:12.089 --> 10:14.483
It'’s been four years.
Please let me in.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.493
Five minutes.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.799
Thank you.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.760
Julio.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.503
Julio.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.800
So,
what was prison like?

11:13.020 --> 11:16.588
People in there,
they ain'’t very smart,
you know?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.329
I mean,
not like you.

11:22.551 --> 11:25.119
I knew they'’d let you go,
see their mistake.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.598
I never stopped praying.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.395
What happened here?

11:41.788 --> 11:42.963
Vincent happened.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.970
Did he lay a hand
on you?

11:50.144 --> 11:53.060
No, he just doesn'’t
believe in God.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.676
Neto. You have to go.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.722
Vincent will be home soon.But, Mom...

12:03.374 --> 12:04.724
Neto, please.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.466
Here. Smile.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.452
No! No! No!

12:47.114 --> 12:48.898
Who are you?

12:49.072 --> 12:51.509
What do you want?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.947
I need to send
your husband a message.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.428
I have no husband.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.349
That'’s Latin for,

13:05.523 --> 13:08.265
"Let the lying lips
be put to silence."

13:10.354 --> 13:13.314
No! No! No!

13:18.014 --> 13:19.973
He'’s going to kill you.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.019
He'’s going to fucking
rip you apart.

13:23.193 --> 13:26.109
You know, I haven'’t
had the pleasure of
meeting your husband...

13:30.287 --> 13:32.246
but I'’m sure as hell
dying to.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.076
No! No! No! No!

13:36.250 --> 13:37.251
No!

13:37.817 --> 13:39.079
No!

14:20.120 --> 14:21.817
When did you
get out, Neto?

14:22.644 --> 14:24.559
A few days ago.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.867
Good to see you again
in God'’s house.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.914
How long has it been
since your last confession?

14:33.785 --> 14:35.744
Oh, it'’s been
a long time.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.444
Would you like
to confess?

14:51.934 --> 14:53.936
Have you seen Julio?

14:56.460 --> 14:57.984
Yeah,
I saw him yesterday.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.510
He really
looks up to you

15:02.684 --> 15:04.642
and helps you during
the Sunday services and all.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.122
He does.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.083
Julio'’s a good boy.
Kindhearted.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.477
But you'’re the one
he really admires.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.658
Maybe I should
keep my distance then.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.358
Perhaps.

15:26.577 --> 15:30.712
Self-sacrifice is the way
to lead a just life.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.423
♪ Yeah♪

15:52.516 --> 15:53.778
♪ Yeah♪

15:58.479 --> 16:00.002
The Jesuit.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.399
You want to talk to me?

16:05.573 --> 16:07.401
Just checking in.

16:07.575 --> 16:10.012
You haven'’t changed
at all, bastard.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.756
Do you need something?

16:14.930 --> 16:16.279
Do you need to be set up?

16:16.453 --> 16:18.673
Well, actually,

16:18.847 --> 16:21.067
I was thinking of
going the other way.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.071
Stepping back.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.339
That'’s not possible, ese.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.604
Blood in, blood out.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.476
For life, remember?

16:39.650 --> 16:41.217
Yeah, I remember.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.306
That'’s why
I'’m telling you first.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.569
See, I'’ve made up
my mind.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.397
Now you'’ve got to decide

16:47.571 --> 16:49.312
which side you want
to be on this.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.143
See those vatos?

16:55.971 --> 16:57.929
They'’d love
to take you on.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.020
Cut down The Jesuit.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.412
Get his rep.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.414
Oh, I'’d love
to see them try.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.809
Me too!

17:17.036 --> 17:18.559
Okay, asshole.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.257
I'’ll give you a pass,

17:21.431 --> 17:24.434
but you can'’t stay
around here.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.307
Can'’t have people
knowing you'’re back

17:27.481 --> 17:29.135
and not taking orders.

17:29.309 --> 17:32.877
Don'’t take too long
to leave, understood?

17:34.314 --> 17:36.272
I hear
you join another group...

17:37.230 --> 17:39.014
You'’re dead.

17:48.371 --> 17:52.201
And my wife,
she has a new boyfriend, uh,

17:52.375 --> 17:53.594
Vincent Rice.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.423
She says he sells condos.
You know him?

17:56.597 --> 17:58.120
La Cara del Norte.

18:00.253 --> 18:03.908
He has weight down south,
not with us.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.165
First, you promise me
payment on delivery.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.775
That'’s one strike.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.126
Then you make me come here.
That'’s another.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.258
Ah-ah.
That'’s enough.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.522
It'’s a shame I can'’t
deal with a better race
of customers.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.524
We got two strikes
on the batter,

18:54.698 --> 18:56.526
so unless you want
to eat a baseball,

18:56.700 --> 18:59.050
I would suggest
you tell me where
my money is right now.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.487
Hey, Vince.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.619
It'’s her.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.231
Ah, shit.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.755
Game'’s over.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.977
Pick up the damn phone.

19:22.422 --> 19:25.381
Finally.Hey, pretty.

19:25.555 --> 19:28.471
I told you not to come here.You forgot to leave me
the money again.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.299
The money?

19:30.473 --> 19:32.171
Riley, the bag.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.185
I'’m sorry.
You want cash?

19:48.012 --> 19:50.928
Here'’s your cash,
you gold-digging whore.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.846
Now fuck off.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.371
Remember, bitch eyes,
you'’re just part of the act.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.204
Bye now.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.322
Is everything
all right?

20:36.496 --> 20:38.149
I just wanted
to see you.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.982
You know your mama'’s
going to kill me.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.767
She doesn'’t
need to know.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.293
All right.
Come on in.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.599
I brought you
a gift.

20:57.821 --> 20:58.996
Where'’d you get that?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.998
Well, Mom told me
it was your favorite,

21:01.172 --> 21:03.174
so I decided to keep it.

21:06.439 --> 21:10.573
You know, my granddaddy
used to sing this all the time
when we went out riding.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.009
Really?Yeah.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.402
I'’ll tell you what.

21:13.576 --> 21:16.579
Why don'’t you, um,
keep this for me?

21:17.580 --> 21:19.365
Are you hungry?

21:19.539 --> 21:21.410
Do you like pizza?Of course I like pizza.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.282
Everybody likes pizza.Let'’s get pizza.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.848
Pizza it is then.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.335
Counselor. I hope you'’re
long gone by now.

22:16.509 --> 22:19.076
No, I'’m still here. I surprised a bunch
of your relatives

22:19.250 --> 22:21.035
trashing my office today.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.776
No offense.
Fabulous-looking people.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.604
Seemed very keen
to find your ass.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.302
What'’d you tell '’em? What do you think?

22:27.476 --> 22:29.913
I grabbed Jeffrey'’s .45
and told '’em to fuck off.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.916
Are you okay?

22:33.090 --> 22:35.484
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, don'’t be dumb.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.834
Leave town before the shit
really hits the fan.

22:38.661 --> 22:39.662
See you, mate.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.028
Wake up, son.

23:00.509 --> 23:01.728
Come on, wake up.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.251
Wake up.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.036
What?

23:06.210 --> 23:07.690
I have to take you home,
okay?

23:08.474 --> 23:09.997
But I want to stay here.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.999
You can'’t stay with me.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.783
Come on, get your stuff.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.093
Take care, son.

23:25.534 --> 23:26.535
Julio,

23:27.884 --> 23:29.799
I told you
you can'’t see him.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.192
He'’s my dad.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.847
I don'’t care!

23:34.021 --> 23:35.762
You don'’t understand, son.Whatever.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.851
Julio, come here! Julio!

24:55.450 --> 24:57.887
There'’s nowhere
to run.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.150
Fucking Jesuit.

25:22.825 --> 25:23.826
Puta!

26:13.006 --> 26:14.311
Who is this?

26:14.485 --> 26:16.400
Fucking Jesuit.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.359
You still got it.Where are you?

26:18.533 --> 26:21.014
You know me.
I got eyes everywhere.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.669
Everyone is after you.

26:23.843 --> 26:26.541
You have more fucking enemies
than you think.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.587
This is why I told you
to leave.

26:28.761 --> 26:29.849
Yeah, I know.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.372
You know what to do.

26:37.944 --> 26:39.902
All this time gone.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.646
I never wrote.
I never came. I--

26:47.475 --> 26:49.129
I thought
you would never be free.

26:49.303 --> 26:50.696
It'’s okay.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.047
I don'’t blame you.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.789
I thought my life
was over too.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.619
I was afraid
of what I would feel
when I saw you.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.622
Julio always said
you were innocent,

27:03.796 --> 27:06.320
and now he can'’t stop
talking about you,

27:06.494 --> 27:08.409
like some kind of saint.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.239
Just tell him I'’m not.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.078
Get out.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.347
What do you think
this is, huh?

28:17.521 --> 28:19.175
This is the end.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.134
I'’m not going back
to the streets.

28:22.396 --> 28:25.442
You thought I was gonna
give up everything, huh?

28:25.616 --> 28:29.795
I have to think about me,
about what'’s best for Julio.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.362
Hey, he'’s my son too.

28:32.536 --> 28:36.062
If there is one thing
I hope for Julio,

28:37.890 --> 28:40.370
it'’s that he never
turns out to be like you.

28:40.544 --> 28:43.286
Oh, you want him
to be like Vincent then?

28:43.460 --> 28:46.289
Fuck you!I know who he is, Nadia.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.900
Get the fuck out.

29:10.444 --> 29:11.750
Tell him.

29:22.282 --> 29:23.805
Yeah? You were right, boss.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.851
They are going
different ways.

29:28.244 --> 29:29.550
Right.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.596
The Jesuit, guys.

29:37.253 --> 29:38.602
Get the boy.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.223
Hey, son.Dad!

29:50.397 --> 29:51.964
Dad! Can you hear me?

29:52.138 --> 29:54.401
They got Mom, and they'’re
trying to get me. Dad? Dad?

29:55.619 --> 29:57.099
Dad!

30:41.100 --> 30:43.537
This is Bobby, over.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.539
Hey, Bobby.

30:45.713 --> 30:48.150
I think we found our boy with
his hand in the cookie jar.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.631
So you might want
to send me some backup.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.198
All right, honey?

31:32.716 --> 31:34.066
Julio?

31:34.240 --> 31:35.284
Julio!

31:43.771 --> 31:45.207
No!

31:45.381 --> 31:47.166
Shut up,
you little shit! Shut up!Let me go! No!

31:47.340 --> 31:49.820
Stop right there, asshole.Dad. Dad.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.387
Julio.Dad.

31:51.561 --> 31:54.434
Julio, calm down.

31:54.608 --> 31:57.306
Everything'’s gonna be okay.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.180
Motherfucker. Hey!

32:01.354 --> 32:04.792
You so much as twitch,
I'’m gonna blow your goddamn
brains out, you hear me?

32:04.966 --> 32:07.838
You see, actions
have consequences.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.710
Or didn'’t they teach you
that in prison?

32:09.884 --> 32:12.974
What, you think
you can come into my home,

32:13.148 --> 32:14.889
fuck my woman,
and get away with it?

32:15.063 --> 32:17.587
You let go
of my son right now.

32:17.761 --> 32:20.242
You see,
that'’s not gonna happen,
because he'’s coming with me.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.461
Riley, bury him.

32:22.810 --> 32:23.942
Fuck!

32:24.986 --> 32:26.074
Fuck!

32:38.478 --> 32:40.915
Come on!Get off!

32:41.089 --> 32:42.961
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he?Dad!

32:43.135 --> 32:45.615
Find him and kill him!

32:45.789 --> 32:48.923
I'’m going to find you!
You broke my fucking arm!

32:49.097 --> 32:52.361
You fucking wetback,
skinny little shit
motherfucker!

32:52.535 --> 32:55.799
Where are you, man?
Where are you?

32:55.974 --> 32:59.107
I'’m gonna fucking kill you.
You got to say your fucking
prayers, buddy!

32:59.281 --> 33:00.848
Say your fucking prayers!

33:09.857 --> 33:12.077
Get in!Dad!

33:12.251 --> 33:14.166
Julio!

33:14.340 --> 33:16.385
Shut up, or I'’ll
shoot you in the face.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.060
Freeze!

33:39.234 --> 33:40.148
Stop!

33:59.515 --> 34:02.475
Now, I picked up
your stuff.

34:02.649 --> 34:05.347
Got your money
and your clothes
from the motel.

34:05.521 --> 34:09.395
Did the cops find Vincent?No. No, nothing yet.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.962
To tell you the truth,
I don'’t think they'’re
particularly bothered.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.964
What are you talking about?I told '’em about Vincent,

34:14.139 --> 34:16.010
but all they really wanna do
is find The Jesuit.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.491
The whole force
seems to have a bit of
a hard-on for you.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.623
Can'’t say
I blame them, really.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.931
A vicious little fucker
like you, a murderer,
gets released from prison.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.326
Four days later, his wife
and a police sergeant
are found shot to death,

34:27.500 --> 34:29.545
and they see you running
from the scene of the crime.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.287
Fuck.Fuck is right.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.637
You gave them the needle
on the golden platter, mate.

34:34.811 --> 34:37.466
I need to find Julio fast.

34:37.640 --> 34:41.775
Well, bastard'’s
probably gotten across
the border by now.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.298
Did you find out
anything about him?

34:43.472 --> 34:45.822
Well, I made
a few phone calls.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.824
Um, Feds definitely
had him on their radar.

34:47.998 --> 34:51.567
He'’s supposed
to be smuggling a truckload
of guns down south.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.787
To tell you the truth,

34:53.961 --> 34:56.181
Vincent makes people
a little bit nervous.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.312
You know what I mean?

34:57.486 --> 34:59.314
"La Cara del Norte,"
right?

34:59.488 --> 35:01.490
Um, that'’s his nickname,
"The Face of the North."

35:01.664 --> 35:04.189
Why do you fucking people
always have to have nicknames?

35:04.885 --> 35:06.104
So?

35:07.714 --> 35:09.759
Well, he was supposed
to have hooked up with, um,

35:09.933 --> 35:12.240
a local gunrunner
by the name of Jet Rink.

35:12.414 --> 35:15.200
That'’s his real name,
by the way. That'’s not
a fucking nickname.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.245
He'’s a Catholic cunt,
like you.

35:17.419 --> 35:18.638
I think you should
look him up.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.466
Do you know where
I can find him?

35:20.640 --> 35:23.773
Yeah, he owns a place
called Lady Birds.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.036
What, the titty bar?

35:26.211 --> 35:27.473
Yeah, that'’s the one,
yeah.

35:32.782 --> 35:35.045
I need one more thing from you.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.667
You got a full tank.I owe you big-time.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.712
In that case,
do me a favor?Yeah?

35:49.886 --> 35:51.453
Big-time.Yeah?

35:51.627 --> 35:52.933
Forget my fucking number

35:53.107 --> 35:55.196
before these psychos
kill me too.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.804
Yeah!

37:38.343 --> 37:40.388
Hi there.
No, I did. I swear.

37:40.562 --> 37:44.087
Yes, I said that
the next weekend after--

37:44.262 --> 37:46.220
You'’re up, sweetie.
There'’s a man at the bar.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.483
Not today.
I just can'’t take it today.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.181
Why? He looks nice.I'’m going upstairs.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.837
Howdy.Hi, I'’d like a coffee,
please.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.492
Uh, black?Yeah, black'’s fine.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.277
All right, there'’s
a two-drink minimum.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.757
I guess I'’ll have two then.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.020
Can I get
a black coffee, please?

38:07.894 --> 38:09.504
How you doing?I'’m fine, thanks.

38:09.678 --> 38:10.766
Good.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.942
All right, thank you.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.466
All right,
follow me.

38:19.819 --> 38:22.561
There you are,
best seat in the house.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.215
That'’ll be $20.

38:30.482 --> 38:33.746
Nice! Do you want company?Sure.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.619
What'’s your name?Inez.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.670
That'’s interesting.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.411
Interesting for a stripper,
you mean?

38:46.585 --> 38:48.108
Like it'’s not
a regular stripper name?

38:50.284 --> 38:51.677
What'’s yours?

38:55.202 --> 38:57.683
You know what Inez means?

38:57.857 --> 39:01.817
It'’s from Agnes.
It means "holy" or "chaste."

39:04.124 --> 39:06.648
I bet I know
what you'’re thinkin'’.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.737
You'’re thinkin'’,

39:08.911 --> 39:11.479
"Oh, I bet
you'’ve been '’chased,'’"
or something like that.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.220
Listen, honey.
I'’m looking for Jet.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.658
Who?Jet Rink.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.010
I'’m sorry.
I don'’t know the guy.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.366
You have a good time.

39:30.455 --> 39:31.630
I'’ll see ya.

39:44.643 --> 39:49.256
Baby, stop it.
What you making?

39:49.430 --> 39:50.953
Lobster?
I like lobster.

39:51.127 --> 39:53.826
Mm-hmm. Butter?

39:54.696 --> 39:57.656
Wait a second.
What?

39:57.830 --> 39:59.571
That cute Mexican'’s
looking for Jet.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.442
Tell Waylon
to get his piece.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.971
I'’m looking for Jet.

40:10.277 --> 40:13.019
He'’s out sick today.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.151
Called in.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.197
You take a wrong turn?

40:17.371 --> 40:19.808
A friend of mine,
Vincent Rice,

40:19.982 --> 40:21.549
suggested I contact Jet.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.029
Said he'’d help me out.

40:27.555 --> 40:30.297
Lots of gun dealers in town,
they can do the same.

40:30.471 --> 40:31.820
I understand that.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.170
The thing is,
Vincent owes him
some money.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.785
Here'’s a down payment.

40:39.959 --> 40:42.701
Hey, Collie. Is this the spic
I'’ve gotta get rid of?

40:42.875 --> 40:44.790
Everything'’s fine, Waylon.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.231
You want
some rice and beans?

40:57.977 --> 40:59.587
So, you got
a number for him?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.591
What'’s your name?

41:04.505 --> 41:06.594
Just tell him, um,

41:06.768 --> 41:09.815
I want to establish
a long-term relationship,
okay?

41:09.989 --> 41:12.644
Really? How nice.

41:13.296 --> 41:15.168
Hey, baby.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.779
I got a fricking spic here.
He says he wants to...

41:17.953 --> 41:19.607
Yeah, from Vincent.

41:20.782 --> 41:21.870
I don'’t--

41:25.178 --> 41:26.179
Name?

41:26.353 --> 41:27.746
John.

41:31.097 --> 41:32.315
Yeah.

41:32.794 --> 41:34.274
John.

41:34.448 --> 41:36.755
No, he'’s a fricking beaner,
that'’s what he...

41:38.147 --> 41:40.193
All right, babe,
I don'’t think
it'’s a good idea.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.325
Fine. No, I...

41:43.849 --> 41:44.937
Fine.

41:52.945 --> 41:54.468
You can go out
by his house,

41:55.643 --> 41:56.862
out by Beeville.

41:57.993 --> 41:59.952
Armadillo 67.

42:00.126 --> 42:02.215
Don'’t be there
before midnight.

42:04.130 --> 42:06.045
Call before
you ring the bell.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.442
You'’re welcome, John.

42:15.141 --> 42:17.099
An Amber Alert
has been declared

42:17.273 --> 42:19.624
following the abduction
of Julio Niente,

42:19.798 --> 42:21.626
allegedly by his father,

42:21.800 --> 42:24.803
the notorious released killer,
Neto Niente.

42:24.977 --> 42:27.545
A statewide manhunt
from Dallas-Fort Worth

42:27.719 --> 42:30.069
to the Mexican border
is currently under way.

42:30.243 --> 42:32.462
This was preceded
by the grisly discovery

42:32.637 --> 42:35.291
of the bodies of his ex-wife,
a state trooper

42:35.465 --> 42:37.772
and an unknown male
at his wife'’s residence.

42:58.358 --> 43:00.055
Pretty clean for a spic.

43:00.229 --> 43:01.404
Attaboy.

43:05.713 --> 43:06.714
Hold up.

43:10.544 --> 43:11.806
This way, friendo.

43:19.901 --> 43:21.120
He'’s clean.

43:21.294 --> 43:22.600
John.

43:24.732 --> 43:26.255
You like lobster?

43:27.343 --> 43:28.867
You know
these little fuckers,

43:29.041 --> 43:32.174
they'’ll amputate
their legs and their claws

43:32.348 --> 43:34.307
if they feel
any sense of danger.

43:35.134 --> 43:36.396
Is that right?

43:36.570 --> 43:38.485
My little Collie,
she just loves them.

43:38.659 --> 43:40.139
I do.

43:40.313 --> 43:42.489
Careful, baby.You be careful, baby.

43:46.711 --> 43:49.235
In you go,
you little fucker.

43:51.193 --> 43:52.412
Ow!

43:53.631 --> 43:55.371
Of course, you already
met my beautiful wife.

43:56.198 --> 43:57.460
She said
you were sick.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.984
I am--

43:59.158 --> 44:00.855
in the fucking head.

44:03.728 --> 44:05.686
But she makes me
feel so much better.

44:05.860 --> 44:07.645
Do I?Yeah, baby.

44:09.559 --> 44:11.431
Come on. I want
to show you something.

44:11.605 --> 44:13.825
Can we have
a drink first?

44:13.999 --> 44:16.741
Of course we can.
Get up there.

44:18.264 --> 44:19.657
Follow me, John.

44:29.971 --> 44:31.973
Ah, here we are.

44:32.147 --> 44:35.107
Guns, guns, guns!

44:35.673 --> 44:37.196
Guns!

44:37.370 --> 44:39.241
Welcome to our humble home!

44:39.415 --> 44:41.330
Well, this here,

44:42.375 --> 44:44.943
this is my pride
and joy.

44:45.117 --> 44:47.336
This belonged
to Sam Houston.

44:48.860 --> 44:50.252
It was made by, uh...

44:50.426 --> 44:51.863
What'’s that fucker'’s name?

44:52.037 --> 44:55.823
Henry Gross.Henry Gross, Ohio.

44:55.997 --> 44:57.912
Actually used this
in the Mexican War.

44:59.174 --> 45:01.307
But this one'’s
not for sale.

45:01.481 --> 45:02.830
You mind if I take a look?

45:03.004 --> 45:05.572
Honey, go get
the fucking drinks,
would ya?

45:05.746 --> 45:06.791
Straight Jack?Please.

45:06.965 --> 45:08.444
Coming up.

45:08.618 --> 45:11.273
Help yourself.
That'’s what they'’re there for.

45:17.889 --> 45:19.281
...what can we do for ya?

45:19.455 --> 45:22.110
I got cash.
I got customers.

45:22.284 --> 45:24.896
And I got an in-place
transportation system.

45:27.812 --> 45:30.640
I'’d like to purchase
a hundred automatic rifles,

45:30.815 --> 45:31.946
the latest design--

45:33.295 --> 45:36.211
XM8s, FN-F2000s.

45:36.385 --> 45:37.909
As many as you can get.

45:40.346 --> 45:42.565
Fill out the order
with M4s.

45:44.263 --> 45:45.873
That'’s one big fuckin'’ order.

45:46.047 --> 45:49.268
Would you shut your mouth,
darlin'’, please?

45:54.577 --> 45:55.883
So, uh,

45:57.102 --> 45:59.191
what did you do before?

45:59.365 --> 46:00.453
Work with Vincent.

46:00.627 --> 46:02.411
And now you want
to work against him?

46:02.585 --> 46:04.631
It'’s called capitalism.

46:05.980 --> 46:07.895
Now, I take it
you have good-faith money?

46:08.069 --> 46:09.070
I do.

46:10.376 --> 46:11.507
How much you got?

46:12.508 --> 46:13.771
10,000.

46:15.033 --> 46:16.817
Let'’s see it.

46:16.991 --> 46:19.385
This beaner don'’t look
like no John to me, Jet.

46:19.559 --> 46:21.866
He looks like one of those
drug cartel guys from the news.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.084
Shut the fuck up.

46:23.258 --> 46:24.912
Waylon, count it.

46:27.741 --> 46:29.221
The thing is,

46:29.395 --> 46:31.832
I don'’t do business
with people I don'’t know.

46:32.006 --> 46:33.442
So what the fuck
are you doing?

46:33.616 --> 46:35.749
Asking you
to shut up.

46:37.011 --> 46:39.579
So I called
me old amigo, Vincent,

46:39.753 --> 46:43.931
seeing as you'’ve been
spreading his name
all over town,

46:44.105 --> 46:47.239
and he told me
all about ya, Mr. Juan...

46:50.633 --> 46:51.983
Shit! Fuck!

46:58.467 --> 47:00.426
You have no fucking idea

47:00.600 --> 47:01.993
what you'’re dealing with
here, mister...

47:02.167 --> 47:03.951
Ah! You fuck!No!

47:04.125 --> 47:08.129
Ya fucking bastard!You son of a bitch!

47:08.303 --> 47:10.218
Collie, get down now!

47:11.567 --> 47:13.569
Get the fuck
off my property!

47:13.743 --> 47:16.311
You filthy, dirty bastard!

47:16.485 --> 47:17.704
Fuck.

47:17.878 --> 47:18.923
My baby.

47:20.141 --> 47:22.709
You greasy little beaner!Collie, wait! No!

47:28.497 --> 47:29.629
Collie?

47:30.369 --> 47:31.413
Collie?

47:32.023 --> 47:33.198
Collie!

47:34.068 --> 47:35.940
Collie!

47:44.339 --> 47:49.040
You killed the only thing
I ever fucking loved.

47:49.214 --> 47:50.302
Where'’s Vincent?

47:50.476 --> 47:51.564
Fuck you!

47:54.697 --> 47:56.917
Fucking motherfucker!

48:01.313 --> 48:02.618
Where'’s Vincent?

48:05.883 --> 48:07.797
I'’ll tell you what I know.

48:09.843 --> 48:11.889
If he'’s not in Texas--He ain'’t.

48:12.802 --> 48:14.282
Then he'’s down south,

48:15.414 --> 48:17.895
buying up
some shit condos.

48:19.809 --> 48:21.768
There'’s a leaflet
on the table up there.

48:21.942 --> 48:23.117
So?

48:23.291 --> 48:26.120
So that'’s where
he keeps everything!

48:26.294 --> 48:29.428
But if he'’s running,
that'’s where he'’ll run.

48:29.602 --> 48:31.212
You'’re full of shit.

48:32.170 --> 48:33.084
Call him.

48:33.258 --> 48:35.913
Fuck you!

48:40.961 --> 48:42.528
Give him a fucking call.

48:44.878 --> 48:46.227
You fuck...

48:46.401 --> 48:47.794
Baby.

48:56.411 --> 48:59.937
Fuck my hole, motherfucker!

49:57.168 --> 49:58.865
Come on, carnal, chase him!

50:48.741 --> 50:50.090
You want a dance?

50:51.744 --> 50:53.006
You like those?

50:55.356 --> 50:56.357
Jake, can I...

50:56.531 --> 50:58.142
Hi there.Hey.

50:58.316 --> 51:00.622
Two coffees?Whiskey, please.

51:00.796 --> 51:01.841
Whiskey?Yeah.

51:02.015 --> 51:03.886
All right.
Two whiskeys, coming up.

51:07.542 --> 51:09.457
There you are.
$40.

51:09.631 --> 51:10.719
Listen, um...

51:14.593 --> 51:16.073
Can you watch my seat?

51:16.247 --> 51:18.814
I'’d like to have a chat
with you when I come back.

51:18.988 --> 51:19.946
Sure.

51:24.385 --> 51:25.865
Can you get that tray?

52:35.804 --> 52:36.544
Fuck!

52:43.203 --> 52:44.857
Who sent you?
Motherfucker!

52:58.740 --> 53:01.178
Stay still, motherfucker.

53:08.620 --> 53:10.535
You'’re working for Vincent?

53:10.709 --> 53:13.625
We'’re not going to tell you
anything, fucking Jesuit.

53:15.670 --> 53:18.673
You'’ve got five seconds
to tell me where my son is.

53:37.126 --> 53:39.172
Are you okay?Yeah.

53:39.346 --> 53:41.957
What about the boys back there?Yeah.

53:43.394 --> 53:46.310
Um, what time
do you get off work?

53:47.180 --> 53:49.313
I'’d like
to hire you.

53:49.487 --> 53:50.836
Yeah?Yeah.

53:51.010 --> 53:52.707
I'’d like you
to be my wife.

53:52.881 --> 53:54.622
Well, shit.
That'’s some job.

53:54.796 --> 53:56.450
Well, not
the conjugal part,

53:56.624 --> 53:59.932
just the pretending
to be my wife part
to cross the border.

54:00.106 --> 54:02.804
You mean not to care about
each other, just to pretend,

54:02.978 --> 54:04.806
like-- like a real wife?

54:04.980 --> 54:06.373
Yeah.
You got a passport?

54:06.547 --> 54:08.767
How much you paying
for this job, mister?

54:09.289 --> 54:10.464
Well...

54:12.684 --> 54:14.294
It'’s only a day, so...

54:17.210 --> 54:18.559
How about 500?

54:27.481 --> 54:28.917
How about a thousand?

54:30.441 --> 54:32.791
It gets really busy here
on the weekends.

54:34.706 --> 54:36.403
And do I get
to keep my clothes on?

54:36.577 --> 54:37.709
Yes, ma'’am.

54:39.101 --> 54:41.147
And then what happens?Well, we cross the border.

54:41.321 --> 54:43.367
The next day,
you take a bus back.

54:46.892 --> 54:48.067
A thousand.

54:50.025 --> 54:52.289
Just a ride.Across the border.

54:58.904 --> 55:00.122
Do you mind?

55:02.951 --> 55:04.301
Put it away.

55:08.827 --> 55:10.698
You'’ve been in prison,
huh?

55:10.872 --> 55:12.570
You'’ve got that look.

55:13.962 --> 55:16.487
So, I didn'’t see those boys
come out of the bathroom.

55:17.662 --> 55:18.967
The owners are used
to cleaning up

55:19.141 --> 55:21.579
those kinds of messes
all the time anyway.

55:21.753 --> 55:23.276
Do you want me
to wear this wig?

55:23.450 --> 55:26.148
Do you prefer blondes
or brunettes?

55:29.326 --> 55:31.893
It'’s driving me crazy.
It really itches.

55:33.025 --> 55:34.809
I think this is going
to be fun.

55:34.983 --> 55:37.246
I'’ve never been to Mexico,
if you can actually
believe that.

55:37.421 --> 55:39.292
Speak Spanish.

55:42.208 --> 55:43.427
When the officer comes,

55:43.601 --> 55:45.646
I want you to smile
and look pretty.

55:45.820 --> 55:48.083
You understand?Sure thing.

55:52.044 --> 55:53.611
Can you open
the trunk, please?

55:56.091 --> 55:58.006
So, I'’m thinking
that $1,500

55:58.180 --> 56:00.095
sounds like a more
appropriate amount.

56:00.269 --> 56:02.576
Yeah, I ain'’t paying you
to think.

56:09.844 --> 56:11.716
You know what?
Let'’s make it 2,000.

56:11.890 --> 56:13.544
It'’s a more even number,
don'’t you think?

56:13.718 --> 56:15.720
It sounds nicer.
Okay, sweetheart?

56:20.377 --> 56:21.813
All the way down.
Yes.

56:44.226 --> 56:46.054
We will spend the night here.

56:46.228 --> 56:48.753
Tomorrow I'’ll take you
to the bus station
so you can go back.

56:52.844 --> 56:54.498
So, what are
you looking for?

56:54.672 --> 56:56.282
I know you'’re looking
for something.

56:57.326 --> 56:59.416
I'’m looking for my son.

56:59.590 --> 57:01.592
My wife'’s boyfriend
took him, went south.

57:01.766 --> 57:03.158
Good night.

57:03.332 --> 57:04.551
Two rooms.

57:05.378 --> 57:06.988
We only have one.

57:09.251 --> 57:11.036
How much?Forty.

57:13.168 --> 57:15.997
So, uh, this boyfriend...

57:17.042 --> 57:18.696
You met him?Yeah.

57:18.870 --> 57:20.828
And he'’s met you?Mm-hmm.

57:22.047 --> 57:23.657
So he knows
you'’re looking for him,

57:23.831 --> 57:25.093
and you'’re
just going to show up?

57:25.267 --> 57:26.617
Yeah.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.925
I mean, don'’t you need
some help, maybe,

57:31.099 --> 57:32.536
if you don'’t mind
my asking?

57:34.625 --> 57:38.237
I mean, I can arrange
the contact for you.

57:39.238 --> 57:40.761
He doesn'’t know
who I am.

57:40.935 --> 57:42.676
Well, how much
is that going to cost?

57:43.590 --> 57:44.809
I don'’t know.

57:46.158 --> 57:47.376
It sounds
pretty dangerous.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.074
Name your price.

57:49.248 --> 57:50.989
Five grand, at least.

57:52.599 --> 57:55.559
Goddamn, you'’re
just gonna clean me out,
aren'’t you?

57:57.038 --> 57:58.649
It'’s a win-win,
if you ask me.

58:07.832 --> 58:09.311
Were those in the truck
the whole time?

58:09.486 --> 58:10.704
Yep.

58:12.184 --> 58:14.142
What was your plan gonna
be if the border man

58:14.316 --> 58:15.535
asked to look
through it?

58:15.709 --> 58:17.842
Well, I wasn'’t
too worried about him.

58:18.016 --> 58:19.626
He was too busy
looking at your tits.

58:22.629 --> 58:24.588
Well, he wouldn'’t
have been the first.

58:29.157 --> 58:31.464
Do you mind if I borrow
a shirt to sleep in?

58:31.638 --> 58:33.858
I packed really fast
and I forgot one.

58:34.032 --> 58:37.470
My sign is a Pisces.
I am such a Pisces.
What sign are you?

58:37.644 --> 58:39.777
I was kind of discovered
like Anna Nicole Smith.

58:39.951 --> 58:41.430
I dream about
going to Hawaii,

58:41.605 --> 58:43.955
'’cause I really wanna open
my own flower shop.

58:44.129 --> 58:46.653
'’Cause I do like
making people feel good,
and I like having fun.

58:46.827 --> 58:48.437
You would love
my grandmother.

58:48.612 --> 58:50.614
You know why?
Because she doesn'’t ever talk.

58:50.788 --> 58:54.008
I learned how to knit
a little bit by myself,
which I like. I like it.

58:54.182 --> 58:56.794
Yeah, I'’m not so good at it,
but I'’m not sure why,

58:56.968 --> 58:58.970
but it'’s just never
really stuck with me.

58:59.144 --> 59:01.712
Oh, wow, are we here?
Are these them?

59:01.886 --> 59:04.279
Ooh, they look like
pretty nice-looking condos.

59:06.020 --> 59:07.021
Houston.

59:08.370 --> 59:11.591
Well, I'’m originally
from Waco.

59:12.287 --> 59:14.333
Yeah.

59:14.507 --> 59:15.552
That'’s right.

59:15.726 --> 59:17.031
So, yeah.

59:17.205 --> 59:20.600
So, I have a friend, um,
who lives in Tampico,

59:20.774 --> 59:23.081
and she was saying
that there was a...

59:23.255 --> 59:25.344
You know, I saw your sign.
That'’s what it was.

59:25.518 --> 59:27.346
I saw your sign,
and I remember her saying

59:27.520 --> 59:29.914
something about this guy,
Vincent Rice,

59:30.088 --> 59:33.482
who is developing
a community of houses somewhere,

59:33.657 --> 59:36.747
and it'’s really
going to be great,

59:36.921 --> 59:39.880
and that she wanted me
to look into it.

59:42.753 --> 59:45.277
You know what?
I think I can do that. Uh-huh.

59:45.451 --> 59:47.932
Yeah. Great.
I'’ll see you in an hour.

59:48.106 --> 59:49.934
And Vincent'’s going
to be there, right?

59:51.152 --> 59:52.632
Oh, great! That'’s great.
He can!

59:52.806 --> 59:53.938
Okay, good.

59:55.548 --> 59:57.855
Good. Okay, thank you.
I appreciate it.

59:58.029 --> 1:00:00.205
Thank you very much.
I'’ll see you soon. Bye.

1:00:09.649 --> 1:00:11.042
I'’m not gonna kid you, Inez.

1:00:11.216 --> 1:00:13.697
You seem like
a real smart cookie.

1:00:13.871 --> 1:00:16.047
The market'’s going down,
the peso'’s going down.

1:00:16.221 --> 1:00:17.744
This is the time
of opportunity.

1:00:17.918 --> 1:00:19.920
It'’s all upside.
Literally no downside.

1:00:20.094 --> 1:00:22.357
"You buy low,
you watch it grow."

1:00:22.531 --> 1:00:24.795
You know
who said that?No.

1:00:24.969 --> 1:00:26.535
Somebody rich.

1:00:26.710 --> 1:00:27.928
I bet.

1:00:29.016 --> 1:00:30.104
So, you have children?

1:00:30.278 --> 1:00:32.498
Oh, not yet.

1:00:32.672 --> 1:00:35.936
I'’ve been thinking about it,
but I gotta convince
my boyfriend first, of course.

1:00:36.110 --> 1:00:37.024
Boyfriend?Mm-hmm.

1:00:37.198 --> 1:00:38.243
Aw.

1:00:39.592 --> 1:00:41.681
Uh, you live here?No.

1:00:41.855 --> 1:00:44.641
No, I live in a small mansion
on the other side of town.

1:00:44.815 --> 1:00:46.338
Mmm.
Oh, my goodness.

1:00:46.512 --> 1:00:47.731
They follow you
everywhere you go?

1:00:47.905 --> 1:00:49.994
That'’s
my sales team.Mmm.

1:00:50.168 --> 1:00:51.865
Do you mind if I take
a couple pictures?

1:00:52.039 --> 1:00:53.475
Feel free.

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:55.695
Just to show my boyfriend.
I think he would really...

1:00:55.869 --> 1:00:57.262
Give me this....really like this place.

1:00:57.436 --> 1:00:58.655
Felipe, bag.

1:00:59.917 --> 1:01:01.614
So...

1:01:01.788 --> 1:01:04.269
Yeah, I guess you can
just show me the facilities,
you know.

1:01:05.487 --> 1:01:06.967
Playground, clubhouse.

1:01:07.141 --> 1:01:08.055
Clubhouse?Yeah.

1:01:08.229 --> 1:01:09.578
Follow me.Okay.

1:01:39.130 --> 1:01:41.219
Up over there
is gonna be the greens.

1:01:41.393 --> 1:01:44.701
Up top there will be
the new football field.

1:01:44.875 --> 1:01:46.572
Of course, over here
will be the casino.

1:01:46.746 --> 1:01:49.183
Right next to that,
the clubhouse

1:01:49.357 --> 1:01:51.272
with, of course,
another pool, a sauna,

1:01:51.446 --> 1:01:52.970
etcetera,
etcetera, etcetera.

1:01:53.144 --> 1:01:55.059
Oh, I'’m sorry.
Did you want one of these?

1:01:55.233 --> 1:01:58.018
Oh. I never had
one of these before.

1:01:58.192 --> 1:01:59.454
You'’re
kidding me.Yeah.

1:01:59.628 --> 1:02:01.108
How do you do it?Oh, it'’s easy.

1:02:01.282 --> 1:02:02.283
Just suck.

1:02:03.154 --> 1:02:04.155
That'’s it.

1:02:05.373 --> 1:02:07.071
Mmm? Like a chimney.

1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:14.992
That'’s him, right?Yeah.

1:02:15.862 --> 1:02:17.951
Okay, so...

1:02:18.125 --> 1:02:20.345
...those are the condo
offices right behind him,

1:02:20.519 --> 1:02:23.522
and let'’s see...

1:02:23.696 --> 1:02:25.524
There were workers
all over.

1:02:25.698 --> 1:02:28.092
They don'’t look
like workers to me,
but they were all leaving.

1:02:28.266 --> 1:02:31.008
Um, and then here I am,
Miss Motormouth, of course.

1:02:31.182 --> 1:02:33.227
"Can you show me this?"
and "Can I see that?"

1:02:33.401 --> 1:02:34.925
"Take me here,"
and blah, blah, blah, blah,

1:02:35.099 --> 1:02:36.361
running my mouth,
blah, blah, blah.

1:02:36.535 --> 1:02:39.103
There were no sign
of any kids.

1:02:39.277 --> 1:02:43.542
There were no candy wrappers,
no sports stuff or footprints.

1:02:43.716 --> 1:02:46.153
No clothing,
nothin'’.

1:02:46.327 --> 1:02:49.200
Any drawings?No.

1:02:53.552 --> 1:02:55.293
He'’s got him
somewhere.

1:02:58.862 --> 1:03:00.951
Well, I said
I'’d see him at- 00.

1:03:04.432 --> 1:03:06.043
I didn'’t ask you
to do that.

1:03:06.217 --> 1:03:09.307
Well, I did it on my own.
I'’m a big girl.

1:03:10.830 --> 1:03:13.964
And I'’ve handled a lot worse
than him, that'’s for sure.

1:03:27.586 --> 1:03:29.153
Let her in.

1:03:49.869 --> 1:03:52.741
Ah, beautiful.

1:03:52.916 --> 1:03:53.830
Hey.

1:03:54.004 --> 1:03:55.135
Whoo!

1:03:55.309 --> 1:03:56.267
Very pretty.

1:03:58.922 --> 1:04:00.488
This is romantic.

1:04:00.662 --> 1:04:01.576
Thank you.

1:04:06.843 --> 1:04:08.235
Thank you
for coming.Oh.

1:04:10.368 --> 1:04:11.499
Yeah.

1:04:12.849 --> 1:04:15.590
So, you got something
to eat or...

1:04:15.764 --> 1:04:17.723
I'’ve got something
much more interesting
than that.

1:04:17.897 --> 1:04:18.985
Oh.

1:04:19.159 --> 1:04:20.291
It'’s fine.

1:04:21.596 --> 1:04:23.424
Wow, you look
unbelievable!

1:04:31.302 --> 1:04:32.738
Oh, damn, that'’s good.

1:04:33.695 --> 1:04:36.524
Mmm.Good. One more.

1:04:36.698 --> 1:04:37.874
No. You.

1:04:38.831 --> 1:04:39.832
No, I don'’t partake.

1:04:40.006 --> 1:04:41.660
What?

1:04:41.834 --> 1:04:43.401
That'’s not fair.One more.

1:04:43.575 --> 1:04:45.620
Mmm.

1:04:46.795 --> 1:04:48.232
That'’s enough.

1:04:50.930 --> 1:04:52.845
I was wondering something.What'’s that?

1:04:53.019 --> 1:04:56.893
Now, why is it that
a good-looking guy
like yourself...

1:04:57.067 --> 1:04:59.852
...doesn'’t
have a regular woman?
I don'’t get it.

1:05:00.026 --> 1:05:03.551
Oh, I just never had
much luck with the women.
In fact, no luck at all.

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.468
I find that hard
to imagine.

1:05:07.642 --> 1:05:09.906
Well, aren'’t you sweet.

1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:12.821
Can I have
some of this? Mmm.

1:05:15.650 --> 1:05:16.738
Oh!

1:05:18.740 --> 1:05:20.133
Whoo!

1:05:20.307 --> 1:05:22.875
I need to use
the bathroom.No, no, no. Sit.

1:05:23.702 --> 1:05:24.921
Okay.

1:05:30.752 --> 1:05:32.972
Well, you sure like
that thing, don'’t you?

1:05:46.855 --> 1:05:49.902
I really need
to use the bathroom--Sit! Sit!

1:05:53.906 --> 1:05:55.386
What'’s wrong?What'’s wrong with me?

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:57.431
No! No!

1:05:59.303 --> 1:06:01.958
What, you don'’t think
I knew you were playing me?

1:06:03.263 --> 1:06:04.830
Who sent you?No one. Just don'’t--

1:06:05.004 --> 1:06:07.093
Who sent you?I don'’t know what
you'’re talking--

1:06:10.270 --> 1:06:12.142
Such a pretty face.

1:06:12.316 --> 1:06:13.578
What a shame.

1:06:24.415 --> 1:06:25.416
Get up!

1:06:25.590 --> 1:06:27.548
Get up!

1:06:27.722 --> 1:06:29.681
Get up!
Get up!

1:06:30.464 --> 1:06:31.988
Come here! Hey!

1:06:32.162 --> 1:06:33.815
Shut the fuck up.No!

1:06:38.646 --> 1:06:41.388
I just want to know
who to thank for sending you!
Who was it?

1:06:41.562 --> 1:06:43.390
No! No!

1:06:43.564 --> 1:06:44.870
No? Come here.
Open that mouth.

1:06:45.044 --> 1:06:46.045
Open that mouth.

1:06:47.829 --> 1:06:50.571
Eat that wood!
Eat that wood!

1:06:53.009 --> 1:06:54.662
Before I carve up
that pretty face of yours,

1:06:54.836 --> 1:06:56.577
you'’re gonna tell me
exactly who it was!

1:06:56.751 --> 1:06:58.753
Who was it?

1:07:07.371 --> 1:07:08.589
Go to the motel.

1:07:08.763 --> 1:07:10.548
I'’ll call you
if I need a ride.

1:07:11.592 --> 1:07:12.811
What are you gonna do?

1:07:12.985 --> 1:07:14.247
Go, please.

1:07:34.702 --> 1:07:36.269
Where'’s my son?

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:40.534
You'’ll never find him.

1:07:46.410 --> 1:07:49.369
You know that
during the Inquisition,

1:07:49.543 --> 1:07:52.372
the Jesuits would place
the instruments of interrogation

1:07:52.546 --> 1:07:54.331
right in front
of the accused?

1:07:59.945 --> 1:08:01.512
Often, that was enough.

1:08:02.861 --> 1:08:04.819
They knew that everyone talks.

1:08:05.777 --> 1:08:08.780
Every single one.

1:08:09.737 --> 1:08:11.348
"Grief has limits.

1:08:11.522 --> 1:08:13.393
Apprehension has none."

1:08:15.613 --> 1:08:18.572
That'’s a quote
from Pliny the Younger.

1:08:25.188 --> 1:08:26.537
Now we begin.

1:08:28.669 --> 1:08:30.497
Wait, wait, wait.

1:08:30.671 --> 1:08:32.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:08:32.499 --> 1:08:35.198
Wait, wait.
What are you doing?
What? What now?

1:08:36.155 --> 1:08:38.201
Don'’t, don'’t, don'’t.
Fuck! Fuck!

1:08:38.375 --> 1:08:40.638
No!

1:08:41.726 --> 1:08:44.729
Oh, my God!
Oh, you motherfucker!

1:08:44.903 --> 1:08:46.078
Motherfucker!

1:08:57.655 --> 1:09:00.179
They'’re gonna kill you.
Oh, they'’re gonna kill you.

1:09:04.444 --> 1:09:06.098
They had time back then.

1:09:08.492 --> 1:09:10.146
The accused
were put in cages,

1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:13.149
left to starve
for everyone to see.

1:09:14.759 --> 1:09:16.413
Braided to wheels
on high poles

1:09:16.587 --> 1:09:18.328
for the heat
and the crows to pick at...

1:09:18.502 --> 1:09:21.418
Your boy'’s gone!You say his fucking name!

1:09:21.592 --> 1:09:23.637
Julio! Julio!
They got him! He'’s gone!

1:09:24.812 --> 1:09:25.596
No, no, no!

1:09:29.730 --> 1:09:30.949
Fuck.

1:09:32.733 --> 1:09:34.561
Okay, okay, oh...

1:09:35.388 --> 1:09:37.477
Okay, okay. Okay.

1:09:37.651 --> 1:09:39.131
Oh. Okay.

1:09:39.305 --> 1:09:40.567
I'’ll give you
his name.

1:09:40.741 --> 1:09:43.657
I'’ll give you his name.
His name is...

1:09:43.831 --> 1:09:44.919
Suck my dick.

1:09:48.575 --> 1:09:51.012
Wait, wait.
What are you doing
with that?

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:52.405
Don'’t you
fucking do that.

1:09:52.579 --> 1:09:53.580
Don'’t you--

1:09:57.062 --> 1:09:59.586
Señor Sans!
Señor Sans!

1:10:00.413 --> 1:10:02.154
Oh, God.

1:10:03.199 --> 1:10:04.635
Who the fuck is Sans?

1:10:04.809 --> 1:10:06.898
He'’s a lunatic who lives
out in the jungle.

1:10:07.638 --> 1:10:09.596
He used to be ATF.

1:10:09.770 --> 1:10:12.904
He kidnaps
high-profile people--

1:10:13.078 --> 1:10:15.733
rich Mexicans,
foreigners.

1:10:15.907 --> 1:10:18.475
He'’s got people all over
the country, and he'’s got
a shitload of guns.

1:10:18.649 --> 1:10:20.651
You know why?
Because I sold it
to him.

1:10:21.565 --> 1:10:22.827
And that'’s the truth.

1:10:23.001 --> 1:10:24.698
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.

1:10:27.658 --> 1:10:29.616
I just told you the truth.
What are you doing?

1:10:33.054 --> 1:10:35.405
No, no, no.
I just told you
the fucking truth.

1:10:35.579 --> 1:10:37.276
I just told you
the truth.

1:10:37.450 --> 1:10:38.495
No! No! No!

1:10:46.590 --> 1:10:48.069
Oh, God.
I told you the truth.

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:50.158
You want the real truth?
Huh?

1:10:50.333 --> 1:10:52.987
I'’ll give it to you.
I'’ll give it to you.
I'’ll give it to you.

1:10:53.161 --> 1:10:55.251
I owed Sans. I owed him.

1:10:58.776 --> 1:11:00.256
What, you owed him?

1:11:02.867 --> 1:11:05.217
You used my son
to pay off a debt?

1:11:06.653 --> 1:11:07.828
Yeah.

1:11:09.830 --> 1:11:13.747
Señor Sans. He likes--
He likes little boys.

1:11:17.838 --> 1:11:20.363
Right now, he'’s got
a belly full of leche

1:11:20.537 --> 1:11:22.365
and an ass full
of cream cheese.

1:11:26.804 --> 1:11:27.979
He'’s had more cock
in him

1:11:28.153 --> 1:11:30.547
than a Tijuana
whorehouse.

1:11:44.125 --> 1:11:46.432
Bailarin, it'’s me.
I really need your help.

1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:51.307
Weren'’t you going
to lay low?

1:11:52.177 --> 1:11:54.135
Walk the straight line?

1:11:58.096 --> 1:11:59.402
I know. Listen.

1:11:59.576 --> 1:12:01.186
You know a guy named
Señor Sans?

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.362
Quién? Señor Sans.

1:12:03.536 --> 1:12:06.147
Some fucked-up
ex-ATF agent.

1:12:06.322 --> 1:12:07.671
He has Julio.

1:12:09.716 --> 1:12:11.501
I don'’t know that asshole...

1:12:12.371 --> 1:12:13.503
Fuck.

1:12:13.677 --> 1:12:14.982
...but...

1:12:16.375 --> 1:12:17.985
I'’ll make some calls.

1:12:19.117 --> 1:12:22.120
Thanks.
I owe you for life.

1:12:22.294 --> 1:12:23.730
You already do, carnal.

1:12:25.166 --> 1:12:26.559
Take care.

1:13:34.018 --> 1:13:35.323
Would you mind?

1:13:37.587 --> 1:13:38.805
No.

1:13:55.343 --> 1:13:58.172
Thank you
for saving my life.

1:13:58.346 --> 1:14:01.219
Well, I was the one
that threw you
in the lion'’s den.

1:14:07.181 --> 1:14:08.835
I volunteered.

1:14:11.055 --> 1:14:12.317
For a price.

1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:18.454
All those good old boys
down at the Lady Bird

1:14:18.628 --> 1:14:20.586
probably miss
the hell out of you.

1:14:26.505 --> 1:14:27.898
I want to stay.

1:14:31.771 --> 1:14:35.209
I can'’t afford you anymore.
I'’m running low on cash.

1:14:39.387 --> 1:14:40.650
It'’s Bailarin.

1:14:40.824 --> 1:14:42.608
I know where
you can find Señor Sans.

1:14:43.914 --> 1:14:46.960
Go to Tepito in Mexico City.

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:48.788
Look for a boxing gym.

1:14:48.962 --> 1:14:52.009
It'’s called
Del Toros Boxing Gym.

1:14:52.183 --> 1:14:53.401
It'’s the only one.

1:15:34.573 --> 1:15:35.792
Is this it?

1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:39.447
Oh, my God.
Are those guns?

1:15:45.758 --> 1:15:48.544
I just want you to tell me
what kind of boxing gym

1:15:48.718 --> 1:15:50.763
has guys with machine guns
out in the front.

1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:03.994
So this Señor Sans guy
is not just a kidnapper, is he?

1:16:10.653 --> 1:16:12.132
So, what'’s your plan?

1:16:13.351 --> 1:16:14.918
Are you just gonna
waltz in there

1:16:15.092 --> 1:16:16.615
and ask for Señor Sans?

1:16:16.789 --> 1:16:17.964
Pretty much.

1:16:19.139 --> 1:16:21.402
I need to draw
his people out.

1:16:21.577 --> 1:16:25.276
You got enough money
to catch the first flight
in the morning, right?

1:16:28.366 --> 1:16:29.802
Who says
I want to go?

1:17:24.814 --> 1:17:26.380
This is it, Inez.

1:17:39.350 --> 1:17:40.612
Come on.

1:17:42.266 --> 1:17:43.615
Come on, please.

1:17:55.235 --> 1:17:56.933
Hey, taxi!

1:17:57.847 --> 1:17:59.065
Taxi, taxi!

1:18:04.854 --> 1:18:06.333
Please don'’t die.

1:18:08.684 --> 1:18:10.163
Let'’s go. Please.

1:18:11.469 --> 1:18:12.992
Let'’s go. Come on.

1:19:15.925 --> 1:19:17.230
Señor Sans?

1:19:37.903 --> 1:19:41.124
He'’s here.
Yes, he'’s already here.

1:20:05.931 --> 1:20:07.237
I told you to leave.

1:20:08.847 --> 1:20:11.371
I'’m just not the kind of girl
who leaves her man.

1:20:31.348 --> 1:20:34.394
How much longer?
This crap still says five hours.

1:24:29.238 --> 1:24:31.588
Want to live, bitch?

1:24:31.762 --> 1:24:33.372
I'’m asking you a question,
bitch.

1:24:33.546 --> 1:24:35.505
Are you ready
for close-ups?

1:24:40.379 --> 1:24:41.337
Are you ready for the--

1:24:46.994 --> 1:24:48.648
Move your hands, bastard.

1:24:48.822 --> 1:24:50.172
Arriba!

1:25:58.936 --> 1:26:00.677
I thought you retired,
my friend.

1:26:01.591 --> 1:26:03.549
New life and all that.

1:26:17.259 --> 1:26:18.303
Like my work?

1:26:19.870 --> 1:26:22.655
Unfortunately,
it'’s not original.

1:26:22.829 --> 1:26:24.179
I'’m just a copycat.

1:26:24.353 --> 1:26:29.184
"Good artists borrow.
Great artists steal."

1:26:30.097 --> 1:26:31.447
Where'’s my son?

1:26:31.621 --> 1:26:33.797
In time, my friend.
All things in time.

1:26:35.407 --> 1:26:37.017
But I'’m sure
you learned that,

1:26:37.192 --> 1:26:39.716
having spent
all that time
in lock-up.

1:26:39.890 --> 1:26:41.761
Take out the knives...

1:26:41.935 --> 1:26:43.067
and bring her.

1:26:48.159 --> 1:26:50.770
That was nice work you did
back at Vincent'’s house.

1:26:53.338 --> 1:26:55.340
Your son is this way.

1:26:57.734 --> 1:26:59.649
You have a good-looking boy.

1:27:00.911 --> 1:27:02.129
Sensitive soul.

1:27:12.314 --> 1:27:15.926
He reminds me of my own son,
don'’t you think?

1:27:16.100 --> 1:27:18.494
I used to go by
a different name
back then.

1:27:22.324 --> 1:27:23.586
Hey!

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:26.937
Don'’t tell me you don'’t
remember that face.

1:27:27.111 --> 1:27:28.678
He'’s the boy
that walked in

1:27:28.852 --> 1:27:30.375
while you were
cutting up his mother.

1:27:30.549 --> 1:27:31.637
Mommy?

1:27:39.515 --> 1:27:40.646
Leave him alone.

1:27:42.082 --> 1:27:44.302
But I am the father
of that boy.

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.524
Now it'’s time
for some retribution.

1:27:52.702 --> 1:27:54.660
Bailarin must'’ve thought
it was time for you to pay.

1:27:56.967 --> 1:27:58.751
They say time heals us.

1:28:03.103 --> 1:28:04.279
Bullshit.

1:28:11.895 --> 1:28:13.723
Dad! Dad!

1:28:13.897 --> 1:28:16.247
I guess this was
meant to be, amigo.

1:28:18.075 --> 1:28:19.076
Blood in...

1:28:19.250 --> 1:28:21.818
No! Dad! No! Dad!

1:28:21.992 --> 1:28:24.386
Julio!...blood out.

1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:27.214
No! No!

1:28:27.389 --> 1:28:29.391
Dad! Dad, please!

1:28:29.565 --> 1:28:31.915
Dad! Please! Dad!

1:28:32.089 --> 1:28:35.571
No! No!Dad--

1:29:08.343 --> 1:29:10.170
Yado! Leave him.

1:29:17.439 --> 1:29:19.484
Julio!

1:29:51.995 --> 1:29:53.736
Julio!No!

1:29:53.910 --> 1:29:54.954
Julio--

1:29:55.825 --> 1:29:56.869
Yado!

1:30:01.047 --> 1:30:02.484
I said leave him!

1:30:03.615 --> 1:30:04.834
Goddamn it.

1:30:30.207 --> 1:30:31.426
You see?

1:30:35.517 --> 1:30:37.127
This is what justice
looks like.

1:30:48.312 --> 1:30:50.009
Let'’s see how
your boy is doing.

1:33:37.786 --> 1:33:39.570
Julio,

1:33:39.744 --> 1:33:42.138
I was never the man
you thought I was.

1:33:43.661 --> 1:33:45.141
I killed an innocent boy,

1:33:45.315 --> 1:33:47.796
and for that,
you paid the price.

1:33:49.624 --> 1:33:52.235
For all the things I'’ve done,

1:33:52.409 --> 1:33:54.498
for all the things
I'’m about to do,

1:33:55.891 --> 1:33:57.980
may God have mercy on my soul.

1:34:13.125 --> 1:34:17.608
And now, Judas,
it'’s time for you to pay.
