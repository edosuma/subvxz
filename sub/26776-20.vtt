20:09.575 --> 20:11.176
- It's disgusting!

20:11.243 --> 20:12.377
- Sure is can I
borrow your phone?

20:12.444 --> 20:15.047
- Why?
- Uh to text a boy!

20:15.113 --> 20:17.049
- No.
- Girl code?

20:17.115 --> 20:19.885
- You know the girl code
doesn't cover cell phones.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.155
- Then give your phone to me!
I also want to text a boy!

20:23.221 --> 20:27.559
- Oh!
Daughter of a dumpling!

20:27.626 --> 20:30.729
Piper!
Can I borrow your phone!

20:30.796 --> 20:33.999
- Why does everyone
want to borrow my phone?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.335
- Because your phone is
emitting a radioactive--

20:36.401 --> 20:38.170
ahhhh fine I'm lying.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.405
My boss is having a contest

20:40.472 --> 20:43.375
and whoever wins gets a
really sweet massage chair.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.977
- A massage chair?

20:45.043 --> 20:47.746
- Yes. And the first person
to send him a selfie

20:47.813 --> 20:50.983
from your phone
gets the chair.

20:51.049 --> 20:54.386
- I wonder if the vibrations
from a massage chair

20:54.453 --> 20:56.321
could shake the extra
muscles of this leg

20:56.388 --> 20:59.458
and spread them evenly
through both legs.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.527
- Only way for you
to find out

21:02.594 --> 21:03.762
is for you
to give me your phone.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.698
- That's not the only way.
- Okay.

21:06.765 --> 21:10.435
- Captain man
he had a plan

21:10.502 --> 21:11.770
to travel to Uzbekistan.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.439
How many layovers did he have?

21:14.506 --> 21:16.341
One, two, three, four--

21:16.408 --> 21:19.077
- Hold up, hold up.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.279
Looks like we have a winner!

21:21.346 --> 21:23.348
Oooh!

21:23.415 --> 21:25.684
Twist.
- What?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.726
- Hey, look!

21:34.793 --> 21:36.962
My legs are back
to incredible!

21:37.029 --> 21:38.597
- Fantastic.
- So happy for you.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.432
- Got bit by
a death snake today.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.567
- Piper when
do I get a turn?!

21:42.634 --> 21:44.369
- After me!
- No, I'm next, right?

21:44.436 --> 21:45.804
Girl code?

21:45.871 --> 21:46.972
- My face needs
a chair massage

21:47.039 --> 21:48.540
after I bashed it
on your door!

21:48.607 --> 21:51.209
- So you guys
all want turns?

21:51.276 --> 21:52.811
- Yes!

21:52.878 --> 21:54.646
- Okay.

21:54.713 --> 21:58.817
Maybe we can have a little
competition for it.

21:58.884 --> 22:02.387
- I will destroy you all!
- I'm getting that chair!
