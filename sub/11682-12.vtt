<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.510 --> 00:07.045
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.113 --> 00:09.483
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.551 --> 00:12.053
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.121 --> 00:14.523
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.591 --> 00:16.560
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.628 --> 00:19.799
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.867 --> 00:22.435
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.503 --> 00:24.037
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.104 --> 00:25.672
Should we shoot them?

00:25.740 --> 00:28.242
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.310 --> 00:30.644
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.712 --> 00:33.113
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.181 --> 00:35.349
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.417 --> 00:37.851
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.919 --> 00:39.520
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:44.593 --> 00:46.696
Max! What happened?

00:46.763 --> 00:48.164
Who did this to you?

00:48.232 --> 00:49.900
- Say goodbye for me.
- Max!

00:51.637 --> 00:53.371
Whoever did this
managed to put

00:53.439 --> 00:55.742
a murder weapon in Michael's
hands and get away clean.

00:55.809 --> 00:57.844
Our killer's in there.
We should go in now.

00:59.614 --> 01:01.116
Mike, there's the guy!

01:05.522 --> 01:07.724
We got to find this guy,
and the only thing we got now

01:07.792 --> 01:09.293
is a thoroughly toasted
computer.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.863
We got to make it fast, Sam.
I already talked to Pearce.

01:11.931 --> 01:13.064
She's investigating
the warehouse fire.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.934
You lied to me.
<i>You</i> killed him!

01:15.002 --> 01:16.236
I was framed.

01:16.303 --> 01:18.271
He's Romanian.
His name is Tavian.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.841
Sam and Jesse are tracking him
right now.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.375
Just let me make
one phone call --

01:24.079 --> 01:25.112
Don't even think
about it.

01:31.821 --> 01:33.655
Come on, Mike.
Pick up. Pick up.

01:33.723 --> 01:35.523
This is Michael.
Leave a message.

01:35.591 --> 01:36.925
Damn it.
He's still not answering?

01:36.993 --> 01:39.594
Yeah. Fi said she was with him
like 15 minutes ago.

01:39.662 --> 01:41.797
Something's not right.
Pull over up here.

01:41.864 --> 01:43.766
I want to take a peek at
Mike's loft before we get there.

01:49.374 --> 01:52.444
Oh, son of a bitch.
It's the Feds.

01:52.511 --> 01:55.984
I had a feeling.
Take a look.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.532
I guess Pearce
finally caught up with us.

01:57.650 --> 01:58.951
Looks like Mike's
already in custody.

01:59.018 --> 02:00.686
She's gonna be
after us, too.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.388
I'm not ready to say
this is over yet. Are you?

02:02.455 --> 02:03.455
Well...

02:03.523 --> 02:05.057
what are you thinking?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.592
I'm thinking
that Pearce is taking Mike

02:06.660 --> 02:08.461
to a federal holding facility
downtown right now.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.795
Now, if we haul
some serious ass,

02:09.863 --> 02:11.864
we can stop them
and try and change their minds.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.799
Let's go.
Push it!

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.114 --> 02:28.115
Okay, I'm starting to have
second thoughts.

02:28.183 --> 02:30.751
Are you -- com--
this was your idea!

02:30.819 --> 02:32.854
I'm serious.
This car is Fi's baby.

02:32.922 --> 02:35.223
- If we wreck it, she's gonna be pissed.
- Sam, you got a better plan?

02:35.291 --> 02:36.958
- No.
- Me neither.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.527
<i>Stopping an armed convoy</i>

02:38.595 --> 02:40.095
<i>is a tactical nightmare.</i>

02:40.163 --> 02:41.764
<i>The easily accessible cars --</i>

02:41.832 --> 02:43.566
<i>the ones in the lead</i>
<i>and at the tail --</i>

02:43.633 --> 02:45.067
<i>are the ones that don't matter.</i>

02:45.135 --> 02:47.003
Which way you going?
You going right?

02:47.070 --> 02:48.304
Left.
I'm going left.

02:48.372 --> 02:50.339
<i>The trick is</i>
<i>getting into position</i>

02:50.407 --> 02:52.041
<i>to target the key vehicle</i>

02:52.109 --> 02:53.709
<i>before anyone realizes</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

02:53.777 --> 02:55.444
Hey! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:55.512 --> 02:57.580
- Sam, shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
- Pull up a little bit.

02:57.647 --> 02:58.814
<i>There's no real safe way</i>
<i>to do it.</i>

02:58.882 --> 03:01.050
<i>Send the lead car</i>
<i>into a tailspin</i>

03:01.117 --> 03:02.885
<i>while inserting yourself</i>
<i>into the convoy...</i>

03:02.953 --> 03:03.853
Do it!

03:09.994 --> 03:12.630
<i>...And you can create</i>
<i>your own little roadblock.</i>

03:12.697 --> 03:15.800
Move!

03:15.868 --> 03:17.202
- Hands -- hands right here. Yep.
- Hands on your head!

03:17.269 --> 03:18.837
Yep. No need
to shoot anybody.

03:18.905 --> 03:21.173
Hey. Hey, look,
uh, we're not armed.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.041
We just came here to talk.

03:23.109 --> 03:24.475
Oh, well, you've got a funny way
of saying hello.

03:24.543 --> 03:26.043
Yeah, hey,
that's a good one.

03:26.111 --> 03:28.579
Listen, the guy that killed Max
is on Brickell Key.

03:28.647 --> 03:30.214
His name is Tavian Korzha.

03:30.282 --> 03:32.516
Sounds like you boys
got your story straight,

03:32.584 --> 03:34.919
but it's just that --
a story.

03:34.986 --> 03:36.253
Think we'd pull a stunt
like that for fun?

03:36.321 --> 03:38.388
We got Homeland Security
to lock the island down

03:38.456 --> 03:39.823
and trap the son of a bitch.
- Pearce!

03:39.891 --> 03:41.558
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

03:41.626 --> 03:43.527
We know where this guy is
right now!

03:43.594 --> 03:45.162
We could take him down!

03:45.230 --> 03:47.565
Just let me make one phone call
to set up the meeting.

03:49.201 --> 03:50.667
You owe me that much!

03:50.735 --> 03:54.705
I don't owe you
a damn thing!

03:54.773 --> 03:56.340
You and your friends
are done.

03:56.408 --> 03:57.274
What about Max?

03:58.643 --> 03:59.843
What about Max's wife?

03:59.911 --> 04:02.513
What do you owe them?

04:02.581 --> 04:04.315
Look at me.

04:05.884 --> 04:07.284
This is your last chance.

04:07.352 --> 04:09.420
We miss this guy
and he gets away...

04:09.488 --> 04:10.755
will you be able to
forgive yourself?

04:10.823 --> 04:12.790
I know I won't.

04:17.329 --> 04:18.495
Get them in the car.

04:18.563 --> 04:20.464
He...stays with me.

04:24.304 --> 04:26.105
I guess we're going
to Brickell Key.

04:35.006 --> 04:36.454
All right.
What did Tavian say?

04:36.455 --> 04:37.756
He wants to meet.

04:37.823 --> 04:38.857
He's holed up in
a half-finished parking garage

04:38.925 --> 04:40.125
six blocks from here.

04:40.193 --> 04:42.161
How do you want to play this,
Agent Pearce?

04:42.229 --> 04:43.496
I have a couple options.

04:43.564 --> 04:45.598
The FBI wants to send
a negotiator,

04:45.666 --> 04:47.167
and I got a cowboy local sheriff
ready to send S.W.A.T.

04:47.234 --> 04:48.568
on a full-scale assault.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.138
Tavian has the tactical
advantage, and he travels heavy.

04:51.205 --> 04:53.507
Any direct assault
will end up as a bloodbath.

04:53.575 --> 04:55.508
As far as he knows,
no one's on to him.

04:55.576 --> 04:57.043
You send me in,
I'll bring him out.

04:57.111 --> 04:59.245
What, I give you a gun,
send you off by yourself?

04:59.313 --> 05:01.681
You are seriously overestimating
my trust in you.

05:01.749 --> 05:03.550
You send me in unarmed.
I'll wear a mike.

05:03.618 --> 05:05.318
You can have spotters
in the area

05:05.386 --> 05:07.320
and a tactical unit
on the street watching me.

05:09.524 --> 05:11.358
Okay. You're up.

05:11.425 --> 05:14.160
But try anything,
my teams won't just watch you.

05:14.227 --> 05:15.928
- They'll shoot you dead. We clear?
- Crystal clear.

05:26.739 --> 05:27.906
They got you, too?

05:27.973 --> 05:30.007
Picked me up
at the bridge.

05:30.075 --> 05:31.609
I heard
what was going on.

05:31.676 --> 05:34.311
I asked if I could say goodbye
in case...

05:34.379 --> 05:36.847
Hey, an hour ago, I was on my way
to jail for the rest of my life.

05:36.915 --> 05:38.448
How much worse is this,
really?

05:38.516 --> 05:40.417
The man is ruthless.

05:40.485 --> 05:42.452
He killed one of his own people
to avoid capture.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.888
You won't even have
a gun!

05:43.955 --> 05:45.222
The only way I'm gonna
get out of this

05:45.290 --> 05:46.057
is if I get Tavian
to talk.

05:47.559 --> 05:51.363
I can't ask anyone else
to risk their life for this.

05:56.069 --> 05:57.770
Michael,
come back to me.

06:07.883 --> 06:09.350
Come on.

06:18.559 --> 06:20.126
Tavian!

06:23.730 --> 06:27.799
If you're gonna shoot me...
Get it over with.

06:30.035 --> 06:33.004
Otherwise, let's talk.

06:35.807 --> 06:37.174
Finally.

06:37.242 --> 06:38.876
I've been waiting
for you.

06:41.346 --> 06:42.713
It's been
a busy morning.

06:42.781 --> 06:45.483
Your man Sam said
you'd be here two hours ago.

06:45.551 --> 06:47.685
Instead, he has the police
seal the island.

06:47.753 --> 06:49.521
He doesn't know
who he chooses for an enemy.

06:49.588 --> 06:51.289
You chose us.

06:51.357 --> 06:53.492
You killed our friend
and tried to pin it on me.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.727
Yeah.

06:54.794 --> 06:56.228
And it didn't stick,
did it?

06:56.296 --> 06:58.564
And when I came to kill you,
you wouldn't die.

06:58.632 --> 07:01.601
So, here we are.
You need me, and I need you.

07:01.669 --> 07:03.170
Time to make a deal.

07:03.238 --> 07:05.205
It's too late for that.

07:07.275 --> 07:09.177
It's not just local police
down there.

07:09.244 --> 07:10.912
It's FBI, CIA.
They all know your name.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.247
If you think

07:12.315 --> 07:14.215
you're gonna get out
of this clean, you're wrong.

07:15.918 --> 07:17.418
You son of a bitch.

07:17.486 --> 07:18.853
You got a choice,
Tavian.

07:18.921 --> 07:21.522
You surrender peacefully,
you give us information,

07:21.590 --> 07:23.657
I'll try to keep you out
of Guantanamo.

07:23.725 --> 07:26.326
But one way or another,
this ends today!

07:26.394 --> 07:28.762
Well,
you're half right.

07:28.830 --> 07:30.564
It does end...

07:30.632 --> 07:31.465
for me.

07:33.134 --> 07:35.069
But not for you.

07:36.304 --> 07:37.572
Tavian.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.539
Tavian. Tavian, no!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.069
Pearce, look,
I just want to say --

08:08.137 --> 08:09.838
you're free to go.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.806
But don't even think about
leaving Miami.

08:11.874 --> 08:13.975
And when I call, you answer.
There might be more questions.

08:14.043 --> 08:16.344
If I had told you the truth
from the beginning

08:16.412 --> 08:18.546
and you hadn't heard
Tavian confess,

08:18.614 --> 08:20.448
would you really
have believed me?

08:21.684 --> 08:23.318
Maybe.

08:23.385 --> 08:24.719
We'll never know.

08:24.786 --> 08:26.354
Michael!

08:27.756 --> 08:28.756
Mom?

08:28.824 --> 08:31.059
Agent Pearce,
this is my mother.

08:31.126 --> 08:32.025
Mom, this is --

08:32.094 --> 08:34.061
that was Agent Pearce.

08:34.129 --> 08:35.361
Well, that was rude.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.664
What are you doing here?

08:36.731 --> 08:38.732
I was
in the neighborhood.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.067
All right, I called,

08:40.135 --> 08:41.534
and they told me
you were being released.

08:41.602 --> 08:43.471
I thought
Fi was picking me up.

08:43.538 --> 08:44.672
Yeah, well,
I want to talk to you alone.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.007
And you need to
hear this.

08:46.074 --> 08:48.409
And Fiona and Jesse and Sam
are not gonna tell you.

08:48.476 --> 08:52.446
Your friends crashed into
a CIA convoy for you.

08:52.514 --> 08:55.083
Now, you might want to
think about that.

08:55.150 --> 08:57.519
Look, when you first came back
to Miami, you were alone.

08:57.586 --> 09:00.021
God knows you hadn't
talked to me in ages.

09:00.089 --> 09:02.357
You had no friends.
You lived by yourself.

09:02.425 --> 09:04.092
But that isn't true
anymore.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.195
You have roots here now.

09:06.262 --> 09:08.431
And when anything happens,
it affects all of us.

09:08.499 --> 09:10.667
I know.

09:10.735 --> 09:12.536
But it's over now.

09:12.604 --> 09:13.637
Is it?

09:13.705 --> 09:15.005
I hope so.

09:17.341 --> 09:18.808
<i>Covert operative</i>

09:18.876 --> 09:21.778
<i>is one of the most stressful</i>
<i>jobs there is.</i>

09:21.846 --> 09:25.149
<i>Like soldiers, E.R. doctors,</i>
<i>and astronauts,</i>

09:25.217 --> 09:27.018
<i>spies have to schedule</i>

09:27.085 --> 09:29.053
<i>extended downtime</i>
<i>for decompression.</i>

09:29.121 --> 09:30.722
<i>Carry that stress too long,</i>

09:30.789 --> 09:32.890
<i>and it's easy</i>
<i>to start missing details,</i>

09:32.958 --> 09:34.825
<i>like a strange pair of shoes</i>

09:34.893 --> 09:36.460
<i>under the crack</i>
<i>of your door.</i>

09:38.163 --> 09:39.296
Welcome home, kid.

09:39.364 --> 09:41.298
Oh, no gun, huh?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.267
And I thought boy scouts
were <i>always</i> prepared.

09:44.335 --> 09:45.735
Larry.

09:45.803 --> 09:48.837
I thought you were extradited
to an Albanian prison.

09:48.905 --> 09:51.339
Oh, I was, but I guess I'm
just not done haunting you yet.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.410
- How'd you get out?
- The usual.

09:55.477 --> 09:57.879
Money. <i>All</i> my money, actually.
I'm down to the felt.

09:57.947 --> 09:59.480
But there's
a prison warden in Elbasan

09:59.548 --> 10:02.484
who's six feet lower than that,
so here I am.

10:02.552 --> 10:04.086
Don't bother.
The crate's empty.

10:04.153 --> 10:05.153
I already got
your backup gun.

10:06.655 --> 10:07.555
I'll take your phone now.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.127
Why are you here,
Larry?

10:12.195 --> 10:13.696
I got myself
a freelance gig.

10:13.764 --> 10:15.932
You're gonna help me
break in

10:15.999 --> 10:17.900
to the British Consulate
right now.

10:17.968 --> 10:20.770
That sounds like a fun way
to earn yourself a trip --

10:20.838 --> 10:22.672
to a much more secure
penitentiary.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.541
Same old Michael,
always such a pessimist.

10:24.609 --> 10:26.577
I've got this all
worked out.

10:26.645 --> 10:29.581
See, Michael,
I brought along some help.

10:29.648 --> 10:33.318
I brought along
a very useful, um...

10:33.386 --> 10:35.520
kidnapped guy, kidnapped vic--
kidnappee!

10:36.889 --> 10:38.323
Say hello to Anson.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.560
Let's talk inside,
shall we?

10:43.628 --> 10:45.228
Get him out.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.068
Oh, I see you finally got
a woman's touch in here.

10:52.135 --> 10:53.569
Or is it Fiona?

10:53.637 --> 10:56.339
800-thread-count sheets
have their perks.

10:56.407 --> 10:58.007
Flowers -- I could take them
or leave them.

11:01.945 --> 11:04.147
So, Larry, how's this guy

11:04.214 --> 11:05.915
gonna help us break in
to the British Consulate?

11:05.982 --> 11:07.083
Go ahead, Anson.

11:07.150 --> 11:09.352
Explain why I cut
your vacation short.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.654
I'm a clinical psychiatrist
working for the D.I.A.

11:12.722 --> 11:16.525
He is a government-approved
head shrink for spies.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.626
He doles out meds
and happy talk

11:18.694 --> 11:20.962
for broken toys like you.

11:21.030 --> 11:24.566
The point is, he has high-level
clearance across the board.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.367
One of my patients
is an American

11:26.435 --> 11:27.635
working for the British.

11:27.703 --> 11:30.071
My boss will give us...
the access codes

11:30.138 --> 11:31.772
if I say I'm worried
there's been a leak.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.609
Come on, Larry.
We need more than access codes.

11:34.677 --> 11:37.011
What about building security?
What about --

11:37.079 --> 11:38.813
Don't ask me.
Ask him. He's the expert.

11:38.881 --> 11:41.116
Please? This can work.
It has to.

11:41.183 --> 11:42.818
He has my wife.

11:42.885 --> 11:43.585
Oh.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.321
See for yourself, kid.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.559
You see Claire's necklace?

11:52.664 --> 11:54.497
<i>That</i> is
my insurance policy...

11:54.565 --> 11:58.968
that you are gonna do
what I say today.

11:59.036 --> 12:01.470
And I say let's go!

12:07.545 --> 12:10.547
Yeah.
It's kind of intimidating, huh?

12:10.615 --> 12:11.948
You know,
but we do this right,

12:12.016 --> 12:13.616
we go in there like a hot knife
through butter.

12:13.684 --> 12:17.254
Hey. And you know
how I like a hot knife.

12:17.322 --> 12:19.290
3-5-5-6...

12:19.358 --> 12:21.159
2-9-5-1.
Thank you.

12:22.862 --> 12:24.997
That's the front door,
that's the computer log-in,

12:25.064 --> 12:25.998
and that's the vault.

12:26.065 --> 12:27.132
Please, just let Claire go.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.601
Patience, pal, patience.

12:28.668 --> 12:30.869
If these are right,
if they work --

12:30.937 --> 12:32.204
- I think we have a problem here.
- Excuse me!

12:32.272 --> 12:34.106
I don't know what game
you think you're playing here,

12:34.174 --> 12:35.441
but believe me,
Larry plays for keeps.

12:35.508 --> 12:36.742
What?
I'm not playing a game.

12:36.810 --> 12:37.910
Are you sure?

12:37.977 --> 12:39.144
Because when I worked
for the British,

12:39.212 --> 12:40.912
their access codes
were 13 digits.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.313
These are only 12.
Are you trying to pull something?

12:42.381 --> 12:44.248
I'm telling the truth.
I swear.

12:44.316 --> 12:46.050
Kid, seriously,
what are you doing here?

12:46.118 --> 12:47.485
Check the access codes online
with your phone.

12:47.553 --> 12:48.820
If it's right,

12:48.887 --> 12:50.521
you'll be able to log on
to the basic site remotely.

12:58.930 --> 13:00.798
Cut your way through
the backseat.

13:00.865 --> 13:01.966
No cops.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.067
Go to the Crest Hotel.
Ask for Sam Axe.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.309
Well, well, well.

13:12.376 --> 13:13.510
The codes work.

13:13.578 --> 13:14.878
Now who's getting cute?

13:14.946 --> 13:16.046
I'm not the one
getting cute.

13:16.113 --> 13:17.914
I was burned for a while.

13:17.982 --> 13:19.181
Maybe they changed
the codes.

13:19.249 --> 13:20.917
I just don't want to
die today, Lar.

13:20.984 --> 13:23.252
Okay. Okay.
You, in the trunk.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.753
We'll be back in an hour.

13:30.926 --> 13:33.160
Hey. Understand something,
Michael.

13:33.228 --> 13:34.862
You know, I've let you skate
a few times

13:34.930 --> 13:36.597
just because
of old times' sake,

13:36.665 --> 13:40.168
and I always looked upon you
like...a son.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.704
But that ended
when you sent me to prison.

13:42.772 --> 13:44.539
Now, you don't want to get shot
in the neck,

13:44.607 --> 13:45.907
you do what I say!

13:45.975 --> 13:47.476
And then
you cross your fingers,

13:47.543 --> 13:51.146
because daddy is
in one of those moods.

14:00.261 --> 14:00.985
You want to tell me why

14:00.986 --> 14:02.587
we're breaking in
to the British Consulate?

14:03.203 --> 14:04.436
Are we doing a spec job?

14:04.504 --> 14:05.838
Are we stealing
something specific?

14:05.905 --> 14:07.005
Stop saying "we."

14:07.073 --> 14:08.741
There's me,
the guy with the gun,

14:08.809 --> 14:10.809
and there's you, the guy that does
whatever the hell I tell him to do.

14:10.877 --> 14:12.277
This is not
some soapbox derby.

14:12.345 --> 14:14.580
Okay, but but these
biohazard symbols on these boxes

14:14.648 --> 14:16.048
are making me
a little nervous.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.416
Well, that's fascinating,
Michael.

14:17.484 --> 14:18.884
Feel free to keep me posted
on your feelings.

14:18.952 --> 14:20.152
There are some things

14:20.220 --> 14:22.054
you're not gonna get me
to do, Larry, gun or no.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.123
Okay, fine.
It's just a cover I.D.

14:24.191 --> 14:26.392
I'm the boss.
You're my slow-witted underling.

14:26.460 --> 14:27.994
Oh, and by the way,
lose that jacket.

14:28.061 --> 14:29.896
It's just
a little too fancy.

14:36.170 --> 14:39.205
Okay. What's the job?
Where do we work?

14:39.272 --> 14:41.307
Second floor.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.043
That building is
a CDC satellite office

14:44.110 --> 14:46.012
where Larry Baruchel

14:46.079 --> 14:48.515
was recently hired
to test lab samples.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.917
Brits are one floor up.

14:50.985 --> 14:52.886
If Anson gave us
the access codes,

14:52.954 --> 14:54.722
why break in
through the floor?

14:54.789 --> 14:57.424
Because if we open
the front door of the consulate,

14:57.492 --> 14:59.160
building security
gets a heads-up,

14:59.227 --> 15:01.429
so we're not opening
the front door of the consulate.

15:01.496 --> 15:02.830
- What about --
- Oh, Jesus. You know what?

15:02.898 --> 15:05.266
You're really starting
to piss the boss off.

15:05.334 --> 15:08.170
And getting fired around here
is the real bitch.

15:17.748 --> 15:19.949
Hey.
How's it going, guys?

15:20.017 --> 15:22.018
Got a couple of samples
to run here.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.522
Well,
quiet Sunday, huh?

15:25.589 --> 15:26.622
You broke our streak.

15:26.690 --> 15:27.957
Yeah.

15:28.025 --> 15:29.726
Those are
good-looking boys.

15:29.793 --> 15:31.795
Yeah, they take after
their dad...whoever he is.

15:31.863 --> 15:33.931
Oh ho! Nice.

15:33.998 --> 15:35.966
All right.
Have a good one.

15:36.034 --> 15:37.935
Sorry, need your I.D.,
too, sir.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.203
Huh?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.372
Oh, no, uh, he's with me.
Chris is with me.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.807
Oh, no,
it's not okay, though,

15:42.875 --> 15:44.009
'cause, uh, we got to check
the I.D.s before --

15:44.076 --> 15:46.045
but I don't get my I.D.
till Thursday

15:46.112 --> 15:48.514
'cause I didn't fill out the
paperwork right or something.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.682
Yeah.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.518
This is
what they stick me with.

15:51.585 --> 15:54.320
Uh, it's...okay.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.089
Just sign here and stop by
on your way back to sign out.

15:56.157 --> 15:57.490
- Right there.
- Okay.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.264
There we go.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.800
Nice.
Slow-witted suits you.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.750
What up, Eduardo?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.385
Sorry to make you
come down, Mr. Axe.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.287
I know noon to 3:30
is Sam siesta time, but --

16:28.355 --> 16:29.922
No, no, no, that's okay, buddy.
It's all right.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.023
Who's this guy
who wants to see me?

16:35.563 --> 16:36.597
Are you Sam Axe?

16:36.665 --> 16:37.898
Most of the time.

16:37.966 --> 16:40.568
My name's Anson Fullerton.
My...

16:40.635 --> 16:42.870
My wife has been taken.

16:42.938 --> 16:45.739
This lunatic strapped a bomb
to her neck, and Mike --

16:45.807 --> 16:47.308
Michael Westen?

16:47.376 --> 16:49.311
He said that you might be able to --
that you would help.

16:49.378 --> 16:50.512
Okay, slow down.
One thing at a time.

16:50.579 --> 16:51.713
Where is Mike now?

16:51.781 --> 16:54.149
He's with this guy.
Uh, Larry.

16:54.217 --> 16:57.185
They went downtown -- stop talking.
Give me a second.

17:00.022 --> 17:02.856
Fi, it's Sam.
Hey, we got a problem.

17:02.924 --> 17:04.925
Larry's back.

17:07.295 --> 17:11.097
And who said
I'd never get a day job?

17:11.164 --> 17:13.531
Okay.
Open your box.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.035
Inside, you'll find
all the tools you need

17:17.103 --> 17:19.605
to hack your way up
into that vent.

17:19.673 --> 17:21.973
One flight up
runs past a hallway

17:22.041 --> 17:24.242
connected
to the consulate lobby,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.412
and that's where you'll be
making us a doorway.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.581
All right?
Set yourself up.

17:45.098 --> 17:48.199
Let me remind you of something,
Michael.

17:48.267 --> 17:51.569
In two hours, Anson's gonna
have himself a liquid bride

17:51.636 --> 17:52.937
if this doesn't go well.

17:53.004 --> 17:53.971
You got that?

17:56.274 --> 17:59.275
Got it.
Let's do this.

17:59.343 --> 18:01.511
I like that attitude.

18:01.579 --> 18:03.680
Now, before we do
any of the heavy lifting,

18:03.748 --> 18:08.885
I am gonna buy us
a little privacy.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.130
Follow my lead.

18:20.865 --> 18:22.700
Hey, guys.
Is everything okay up there?

18:22.768 --> 18:24.335
Some kind of warning light
just came on.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.772
There's just a little problem
with the container tank.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.006
It's not ebola.
Here's what we need to do.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.842
Call the police, Tim.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.210
Tim, do you have the sheet
with the CDC instructions?

18:31.278 --> 18:35.481
No, no. It is not ebola.
It is just a Class-2 spill.

18:35.549 --> 18:36.716
The building is empty,
right?

18:36.784 --> 18:39.185
Yeah, y-you're
the only visitors.

18:39.253 --> 18:41.421
- W-what do you mean, Class 2?
- Oh, damn it. Damn it.

18:41.489 --> 18:42.789
Look, look,
we just can't have people

18:42.857 --> 18:44.558
coming in and out
of here.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.092
You need to lock
all the exits.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.962
No phone calls, and that is
the emergency-response protocol

18:49.029 --> 18:51.497
that we will follow
until Hazmat gets here,

18:51.565 --> 18:52.899
if it comes to that.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.467
You're gonna be hearing
a lot of noises,

18:54.534 --> 18:55.768
a lot of banging.

18:55.836 --> 18:57.570
That's us looking for that leak.
That's normal.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.938
The most important thing

18:59.005 --> 19:00.272
is for you guys
to just keep your distance.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.974
Okay, let's go, let's go,
let's go! Lock it up!

19:02.041 --> 19:03.975
Come on!
Lock it up!

19:08.280 --> 19:10.814
Oh, there's no way anybody's
gonna crash our party now.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.820
Jesse, I need you
to get Maddy out of town.

19:16.888 --> 19:17.921
Larry's back.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.222
Larry? How the hell --

19:19.290 --> 19:20.657
what is Larry doing
back in town?

19:20.725 --> 19:22.592
I don't know much,
but Maddy knows the drill.

19:22.660 --> 19:23.893
The minute you say,

19:23.961 --> 19:25.529
"It's a Disney World
kind of day,"

19:25.597 --> 19:27.097
she'll grab the shotgun
and go.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.998
Keep her mind off it, will you?
Oh, she loves the teacups.

19:30.534 --> 19:32.135
Sam, you're scaring me.
Do you think Larry's gonna --

19:32.203 --> 19:33.370
Just breathe.
Stay calm.

19:33.437 --> 19:35.205
How am I supposed to stay calm?
My wife is --

19:35.272 --> 19:36.505
Your wife
is gonna be fine.

19:36.573 --> 19:38.207
She's the only thing keeping
Michael Westen

19:38.275 --> 19:40.309
from snapping Larry's neck,
and he knows it.

19:40.377 --> 19:42.011
So, just calm down.
Everything's gonna be --

19:46.749 --> 19:47.849
Oh, God.

19:56.925 --> 19:59.793
Sam...I got here 2 minutes ago,
and it was too late.

19:59.861 --> 20:00.895
Where's my wife?
Where's Claire?

20:00.962 --> 20:02.196
I'm sorry.

20:02.264 --> 20:05.433
No, you can't --
you said he wouldn't kill her!

20:05.501 --> 20:06.768
Claire!

20:06.836 --> 20:08.169
- Claire!
- Anson.

20:08.237 --> 20:09.037
Anson,
you can't go over there.

20:12.409 --> 20:14.043
- Where's my wife?
- I'm sorry.

20:37.659 --> 20:38.825
I don't get it.

20:38.893 --> 20:40.828
I mean, Larry's a monster,

20:40.895 --> 20:42.296
but that woman
was his only leverage.

20:42.363 --> 20:43.330
Why kill her?

20:43.398 --> 20:44.265
It doesn't make
any sense.

20:46.034 --> 20:49.303
Anson, look, I know it's hard
to focus right now,

20:49.371 --> 20:50.905
but the man
who killed your wife,

20:50.973 --> 20:53.274
he's gonna be out of the country
in a matter of hours

20:53.342 --> 20:54.409
if you don't help us.

20:54.477 --> 20:56.511
How? What can I do?

20:56.579 --> 20:58.479
You need to tell us
everything you know

20:58.547 --> 20:59.814
about what Larry is doing.

20:59.882 --> 21:01.449
Where did he take Michael?

21:01.517 --> 21:06.320
I gave him, uh, the codes
for the British Consulate,

21:06.388 --> 21:07.722
the access codes.

21:07.790 --> 21:09.490
Sam...

21:09.558 --> 21:11.141
Look, I don't want to
leave you here like this,

21:11.166 --> 21:13.526
but Sam and I have --
- No. If you're going after

21:13.527 --> 21:15.829
the son of bitch that killed
Claire, I'm coming with you.

21:15.830 --> 21:19.400
I want to see him go down.
I want to see him dead.

21:20.602 --> 21:21.469
Let's go.

21:23.839 --> 21:27.509
Any idea what they feed you
in an Albanian prison?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.578
I don't know.
Yogurt?

21:29.645 --> 21:30.645
I have no idea.

21:30.713 --> 21:32.681
I ate it every day
for 8 months.

21:32.749 --> 21:33.982
I still couldn't tell you
what it was.

21:34.050 --> 21:36.485
You fishing for an apology,
Larry?

21:36.553 --> 21:38.287
You gonna let me go
if I say I'm sorry

21:38.355 --> 21:40.356
I didn't roll over
and let you ruin my life?

21:40.423 --> 21:41.824
Nah, I don't suppose so.

21:41.892 --> 21:43.226
Well, then,
let's do this.

21:43.294 --> 21:45.195
Fine. Up you go.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.798
Well, I need a shield
for the sparks.

21:47.866 --> 21:50.368
Cardboard should do it.
I'll check the copy room.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.937
Oh, and go call your friends?
No, I don't think so.

21:53.004 --> 21:56.274
Get your ass up there
and start cutting.

21:56.341 --> 21:58.243
You'll be fine.

21:58.310 --> 22:01.078
If anyone's used to getting
a little burned, it's you.

22:05.551 --> 22:08.252
<i>Level-3 contagion facilities</i>

22:08.320 --> 22:10.421
<i>are designed with massive</i>
<i>exhaust systems</i>

22:10.488 --> 22:13.724
<i>to quickly remove harmful gases</i>
<i>in case of an emergency.</i>

22:13.792 --> 22:15.993
<i>They're just about the only</i>
<i>type of ventilation shaft</i>

22:16.060 --> 22:18.362
<i>a full-grown man can fit into,</i>

22:18.429 --> 22:20.363
<i>so they can double</i>
<i>as a vertical passageway</i>

22:20.431 --> 22:22.231
<i>to the next floor up.</i>

22:22.299 --> 22:23.666
<i>But if you have to make</i>
<i>your own exit.</i>

22:28.338 --> 22:30.071
Ma'am, I told you.

22:30.139 --> 22:32.106
I don't care what kind of purse
you left upstairs --

22:32.174 --> 22:34.276
It's a Fendi, and it has
a very nice reward in it

22:34.343 --> 22:35.944
for the handsome guard
who saves my life

22:36.012 --> 22:37.279
by letting me go grab it.

22:37.347 --> 22:38.380
No one's allowed in today,
period.

22:38.448 --> 22:40.082
Believe me.
I'm doing you a favor.

22:40.149 --> 22:41.316
But --

22:42.685 --> 22:44.118
No luck?

22:44.186 --> 22:45.620
Larry spooked those guards
somehow.

22:45.688 --> 22:47.022
The place
is locked down tight.

22:47.089 --> 22:48.790
Can't you warn the guards?
W-w-won't they help?

22:48.858 --> 22:50.826
Look, if we send a couple
of Rent-A-Cops up there --

22:50.894 --> 22:52.828
hell, even if we send
a slew of real cops up there --

22:52.896 --> 22:54.630
this is gonna get bloody.

22:54.698 --> 22:56.165
So, that's it?
Wh-- he gets away with it?!

22:56.233 --> 22:57.533
He's not getting away
with anything.

22:57.601 --> 22:59.502
We just have to find another way
into the building.

22:59.569 --> 23:01.637
My feeling exactly, Fi.
Look. Check this out.

23:01.705 --> 23:03.773
See that?
It's a freight access,

23:03.840 --> 23:05.241
but it goes
right inside the building.

23:05.309 --> 23:07.576
And under the circumstances...

23:07.644 --> 23:08.911
maybe we should just blast
our way in.

23:08.979 --> 23:10.713
Oh, Sam...

23:10.781 --> 23:12.281
you're finally speaking
my language.

23:19.088 --> 23:20.522
What is that?

23:20.590 --> 23:22.757
It's a block of C-4.
You should stand back.

23:22.825 --> 23:24.459
Anson, listen.

23:24.527 --> 23:27.695
You're gonna stay here, okay?
This is gonna happen fast.

23:27.763 --> 23:29.064
When that door gets opened,

23:29.131 --> 23:30.698
we only got one shot to
get up there and surprise him.

23:35.437 --> 23:36.904
Michael, are you okay?

23:36.972 --> 23:39.006
Oh, Michael is just fine,

23:39.074 --> 23:40.641
at least
for the moment.

23:43.645 --> 23:45.346
What are you after,
Larry?

23:45.414 --> 23:47.782
You know, you are probably not
the first person

23:47.850 --> 23:49.351
I would tell that to,

23:49.418 --> 23:51.419
so why don't you
do me a favor

23:51.487 --> 23:54.389
and hold all your questions
till forever?!

23:54.457 --> 23:57.226
Now, I have something
I want to explain.

23:57.294 --> 24:00.429
I think you know by now
I never wanted to kill Michael.

24:00.497 --> 24:02.364
Touch him, you are dead.

24:02.432 --> 24:04.000
Oh, that is
pretty tough talk

24:04.068 --> 24:05.735
coming from
a tiny, little psychopath

24:05.802 --> 24:08.237
in, what are those,
Capri pants?

24:08.305 --> 24:09.805
Where the hell is he?

24:12.843 --> 24:15.511
Hello!

24:15.579 --> 24:18.013
Hi, Sam.
Oh, look at you.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.983
I see Jenny Craig
has done her magic.

24:21.050 --> 24:23.419
Thinner but not smarter.

24:23.487 --> 24:25.021
Larry,
you got two choices --

24:25.088 --> 24:26.889
whatever you're after
or your freedom.

24:26.957 --> 24:28.257
Now, you let Michael
out of there,

24:28.325 --> 24:29.925
you can watch us
drive way.

24:29.993 --> 24:32.061
You live to fight another day.
If you don't --

24:32.129 --> 24:33.963
Shut up, you gas bag!

24:34.030 --> 24:36.432
This is not
a conversation!

24:36.500 --> 24:38.634
This is me telling you...

24:38.702 --> 24:43.039
that if you try anything,
I will see you coming,

24:43.107 --> 24:46.576
and I will kill him.

24:46.644 --> 24:48.545
Believe that.

24:51.449 --> 24:52.583
You know what?
He's bluffing.

24:52.650 --> 24:55.152
Larry may be
a murderous ghoul,

24:55.220 --> 24:56.687
but he's always had
a soft spot for Mike.

24:56.755 --> 24:58.022
No.

24:58.089 --> 25:00.524
He said, "I never wanted to
kill Michael."

25:00.592 --> 25:02.226
He's talking about
something that hasn't happened,

25:02.294 --> 25:03.494
as if it were
in the past.

25:03.562 --> 25:05.463
That's never a good sign
coming from a sociopath.

25:05.531 --> 25:07.132
What are you saying?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.669
That no matter what we do,
he's gonna...

25:09.736 --> 25:11.070
I'm so sorry.

25:29.824 --> 25:31.424
Well, you got to love
the Brits.

25:31.492 --> 25:33.460
About as good
at decorating a consulate

25:33.527 --> 25:35.195
as they are at holding on
to their colonies.

25:35.262 --> 25:36.963
- Let's just do the job.
- You know, a funny thing happened

25:37.030 --> 25:38.297
while you were up
in that vent.

25:38.365 --> 25:42.267
Our buddy Anson showed up
out front with Fi and Sam.

25:48.773 --> 25:52.109
I warned you,
and I told you not to test me.

25:52.176 --> 25:56.846
Now, you are gonna do
what I brought you here to do.

25:56.914 --> 25:59.049
And what's that, Larry?

25:59.116 --> 26:01.184
You're gonna plant a report
in a diplomatic pouch.

26:01.252 --> 26:03.920
A few nice people
are gonna rot in prison,

26:03.988 --> 26:06.456
and a few million dollars
lands in my bank account.

26:11.763 --> 26:14.232
You know, if you want to earn
some money,

26:14.299 --> 26:16.901
I can do it without you hurting
innocent people.

26:16.969 --> 26:18.936
Stop the act, man.
Stop it.

26:19.004 --> 26:22.940
I know your holier-than-thou
Boy Scout routine by heart.

26:23.008 --> 26:24.375
And you know
what else I know?

26:24.443 --> 26:26.811
I know something
that nobody else knows.

26:26.879 --> 26:31.049
You deserved
to be burned.

26:33.018 --> 26:34.285
Oh.

26:34.353 --> 26:35.820
Have we forgotten about
Chechnya?

26:39.925 --> 26:41.893
I didn't do anything
in Chechnya.

26:41.961 --> 26:44.963
Oh. Oh, is that
what you tell yourself?

26:45.031 --> 26:46.698
You stood there.

26:46.766 --> 26:48.867
You watched it happen.

26:48.935 --> 26:51.136
You let me kill
those people!

26:53.206 --> 26:56.375
And then you helped me
cover it up,

26:56.443 --> 26:58.477
because that was the job!

26:58.545 --> 27:00.146
Yeah! I did!

27:00.213 --> 27:01.814
I'm just like you, Larry!

27:03.484 --> 27:05.018
Is that what you want?

27:07.956 --> 27:11.025
You know what I want,
Michael?

27:11.093 --> 27:12.994
I want you to choose.

27:13.061 --> 27:17.465
You're either a civilian,
or you're an operator.

27:17.533 --> 27:20.034
And until you choose...

27:20.102 --> 27:21.469
you're just pathetic.

27:22.906 --> 27:24.439
Now, clean yourself up.

27:24.507 --> 27:26.074
We got work to do.

27:35.165 --> 27:37.129
Watch where
you're bleeding, kid.

27:37.130 --> 27:38.397
I'm gonna wipe
the security cam

27:38.465 --> 27:40.032
so they won't know
who came through the wall.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.467
But it won't do any good

27:41.535 --> 27:43.202
if you smear your DNA
all over their furniture.

27:43.269 --> 27:44.569
Here.

27:44.637 --> 27:46.771
Where are we
planting this?

27:46.839 --> 27:48.673
There's that "we" again.

27:48.741 --> 27:50.942
All right,
the outgoing diplomatic pouch

27:51.009 --> 27:53.110
is in the vault
right over there,

27:53.178 --> 27:55.412
and access
is remotely controlled

27:55.479 --> 27:57.881
from this office
right here.

27:57.949 --> 28:00.116
Clever. It makes a break-in
a two-man job.

28:00.184 --> 28:01.884
So, you go into the vault.

28:01.952 --> 28:03.920
Oh, oh,
and wouldn't you love the chance

28:03.987 --> 28:05.855
to have me trapped
in an airtight cage?

28:05.922 --> 28:08.390
No. <i>You're</i> going in.

28:08.458 --> 28:10.692
Well, then, you'll never know for
sure whether I planted the file.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.062
You see these frown lines
on my face?

28:13.129 --> 28:16.800
You see, I was not, in fact,
born yesterday.

28:16.868 --> 28:17.934
Come on.
I want to show you something.

28:19.537 --> 28:22.740
I will be watching you
the whole way.

28:22.807 --> 28:24.041
Now, you go in there.

28:24.109 --> 28:26.444
You put the documents
in the diplomatic pouch.

28:26.511 --> 28:28.279
You log it in
to the computer.

28:28.347 --> 28:29.647
You wait until I buzz you
into the vault,

28:29.715 --> 28:32.650
then you switch the pouches,
and we go home.

28:32.717 --> 28:34.351
- Got it?
- I got it.

28:34.419 --> 28:36.086
Let's do this, huh?

28:36.154 --> 28:37.821
Oh, and, Michael?

28:37.889 --> 28:40.090
Stay out of trouble.

28:40.158 --> 28:42.859
<i>We</i> do remember what happens
when you test me, right?

28:42.927 --> 28:44.661
How could I forget?

29:00.646 --> 29:02.180
Bingo.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.252
Okay.

29:12.892 --> 29:14.125
Bye-bye.

29:16.963 --> 29:18.863
<i>Before cellphones</i>
<i>were invented,</i>

29:18.931 --> 29:21.099
<i>it was much harder</i>
<i>to call out to an office</i>

29:21.166 --> 29:22.667
<i>without everyone else</i>
<i>in the building seeing</i>

29:22.734 --> 29:24.001
<i>that you were on the line.</i>

29:24.069 --> 29:26.170
<i>Diplomatic spies in the '80s</i>

29:26.237 --> 29:28.440
<i>devised an easy solution</i>
<i>to the problem --</i>

29:28.507 --> 29:31.676
<i>a corded handset</i>
<i>wired to a fax machine</i>

29:31.744 --> 29:33.178
<i>gives you the freedom</i>
<i>to make calls</i>

29:33.245 --> 29:34.979
<i>without showing a line in use.</i>

29:35.047 --> 29:37.883
<i>If you can find a way to hide</i>
<i>from the security cameras,</i>

29:37.950 --> 29:40.419
<i>you can call out without anyone</i>
<i>knowing what you're doing.</i>

29:40.486 --> 29:42.754
I am saying we storm the building,

29:42.822 --> 29:44.356
we take out the guards
with rubber bullets,

29:44.424 --> 29:46.092
and we go after Larry
with the real ones!

29:46.159 --> 29:48.060
- Fiona...
- You are talking about an armed assault

29:48.128 --> 29:50.163
of a friendly government consulate, Fi!
- Oh, please.

29:50.231 --> 29:51.831
- The British are far from friendly!
- Come on. Look.

29:51.898 --> 29:52.995
I think that --
if you don't succeed

29:52.996 --> 29:53.959
in getting Mike killed,
the three of us are

29:53.960 --> 29:55.763
gonna wind up in prison
for the rest of our lives!

29:55.769 --> 29:56.602
Fiona, I think
your phone is ringing.

30:00.239 --> 30:01.840
Hello?

30:01.908 --> 30:03.608
Fi, Larry knows
you're outside.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.243
You got to forget about
the consulate and pull back.

30:05.311 --> 30:06.944
If you can get
to Anson's wife,

30:07.012 --> 30:08.312
get her out of
that bomb collar and --

30:08.380 --> 30:09.781
Michael, she's dead.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.016
What?

30:11.084 --> 30:13.185
No, no, no, no.
Why would Larry --

30:13.252 --> 30:15.154
Whatever Larry has planned for
you this time, it is not good.

30:15.222 --> 30:16.488
Can you run?

30:16.556 --> 30:18.256
No, he's got eyes
all over this place.

30:18.324 --> 30:19.591
Yeah, we found that out
the hard way.

30:19.659 --> 30:20.825
What do you want us
to do?

30:20.893 --> 30:22.561
I don't know what you could do.

30:22.628 --> 30:24.896
He'll see any move coming.
The windows are bulletproof.

30:24.964 --> 30:26.564
I think I'm just gonna have to
plant this file

30:26.632 --> 30:27.932
in the vault like he wants

30:28.000 --> 30:30.301
and try to undo the damage
if I survive.

30:32.370 --> 30:34.371
Okay. Okay, great.

30:34.439 --> 30:36.073
Stay in the vault.
Keep your head down.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.440
Fi, what are you
talking about?

30:37.508 --> 30:39.542
Good. And I'll handle
everything else.

30:39.610 --> 30:42.444
Fi, whatever you are planning,
you have to walk away.

30:42.512 --> 30:43.979
You ca-- Fi!

30:44.047 --> 30:45.981
Michael found us a way in.

30:46.049 --> 30:47.082
It's on the east side
of the building.

30:47.150 --> 30:48.684
Okay.
Now we're in business.

30:48.751 --> 30:50.986
We're gonna need the
jaws of life to cut through the wall.

30:51.054 --> 30:52.788
There's one on the fire station
in Brickell.

30:52.856 --> 30:54.123
You two go get that,
and I'll keep watch here.

30:54.191 --> 30:56.258
Fi, how's that supposed to
go down, exactly?

30:56.326 --> 30:58.127
There's no time to explain,
okay? Just go do it!

30:58.195 --> 31:00.597
- Okay, okay.
- Everything will be fine.

31:04.269 --> 31:06.037
<i>Uncut RDX,</i>

31:06.104 --> 31:08.873
<i>sometimes known as T-4</i>
<i>or cyclonite,</i>

31:08.941 --> 31:12.643
<i>is the most powerful military-grade</i>
<i> high explosive there is.</i>

31:12.711 --> 31:14.545
<i>It's an incredibly stable solid</i>

31:14.613 --> 31:16.613
<i>that can withstand</i>
<i>small-arms fire,</i>

31:16.681 --> 31:19.082
<i>but when detonated,</i>
<i>expands faster</i>

31:19.150 --> 31:22.051
<i>than a plasticized formulation</i>
<i>like C-4.</i>

31:22.119 --> 31:24.086
<i>Simply put,</i>
<i>T-4 is the good stuff --</i>

31:24.154 --> 31:27.356
<i>a lethal explosive that creates</i>
<i>a wall of fire and shrapnel</i>

31:27.424 --> 31:31.294
<i>that will decimate everything</i>
<i>and everyone in its path.</i>

31:38.203 --> 31:38.969
Bye-bye.

31:44.742 --> 31:46.343
Okay, kid,
it's like we were never here.

31:46.411 --> 31:47.411
Now, let's make this snappy.

32:06.232 --> 32:07.566
All right,
swap out your file

32:07.634 --> 32:09.101
for the one in box...

32:09.168 --> 32:12.104
378-Baker.

32:20.380 --> 32:22.814
What have we here?

32:29.188 --> 32:31.389
You're gonna have to
walk out of there eventually.

32:31.456 --> 32:33.291
I have always admired you,
Fiona.

32:33.358 --> 32:34.692
I mean,
with Michael's smarts

32:34.760 --> 32:36.961
and your stomach
for violence,

32:37.029 --> 32:38.897
I mean, hell, the two of you
could almost be me.

32:38.964 --> 32:40.465
Ohh!

32:43.870 --> 32:45.137
Wow.

32:45.204 --> 32:48.340
Now -- now, what part
didn't you hear, dear?

32:48.408 --> 32:50.209
This is bulletproof.

32:51.812 --> 32:54.280
Go get a .50 cal --
then maybe you got a shot.

32:55.916 --> 32:58.284
Now, listen, I want to do you
a favor, Fiona.

32:58.351 --> 33:02.155
Go home now. Seriously.

33:02.222 --> 33:05.125
You're not gonna want to see
the way this ends.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.726
Oh, you're wrong, Larry.

33:06.794 --> 33:08.695
I've always wanted to see
how this ends.

33:38.624 --> 33:39.924
Oh, God.

33:39.992 --> 33:42.026
What was that? Michael.

33:42.094 --> 33:43.961
Oh, God.

34:04.451 --> 34:05.752
Oh, Michael.

34:08.155 --> 34:09.322
Oh, thank God.

34:09.389 --> 34:10.723
Oh.

34:10.791 --> 34:14.126
Fi, why did you plant the bomb
in the lobby?

34:14.194 --> 34:15.728
I didn't.

34:15.795 --> 34:18.630
I made one targeted explosive,
just enough for Larry.

34:18.697 --> 34:20.264
Somebody else must have --

34:20.333 --> 34:22.001
The security guards --

34:22.069 --> 34:23.335
they're dead.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.145
Fi!

34:48.205 --> 34:53.643
I don't understand why Larry
had bombs in that lobby...

34:53.710 --> 34:56.313
Or how my detonator
could have set them off.

34:56.380 --> 34:57.948
Sam and Jesse
are looking into it.

34:58.016 --> 34:59.549
They're trying to
make sense of this.

34:59.617 --> 35:02.419
Make sense of it?

35:02.487 --> 35:04.188
Two innocent people
are dead.

35:04.255 --> 35:06.823
You couldn't have known
what was going to happen, Fi.

35:06.891 --> 35:08.892
Yeah, well, I knew...

35:08.960 --> 35:10.827
how dangerous it could be.

35:10.895 --> 35:12.729
That's why I lied to Sam.

35:14.399 --> 35:16.466
When he found out what happened,
the look on his face...

35:16.534 --> 35:18.369
No one's blaming you
for this.

35:18.437 --> 35:19.836
Well, they should.

35:19.904 --> 35:21.271
It was
my finger on that button.

35:21.339 --> 35:22.873
I killed those men.

35:27.111 --> 35:30.914
And cut.

35:30.982 --> 35:32.582
That was really,
really great, you two.

35:32.650 --> 35:34.218
The tears...

35:34.285 --> 35:36.253
The "I killed those men."

35:36.321 --> 35:38.723
Really, really lovely.

35:38.790 --> 35:40.191
How the hell
did you get in here?

35:40.259 --> 35:42.393
I...borrowed this
from Fiona's purse

35:42.461 --> 35:44.428
while she was consoling me.

35:46.098 --> 35:47.932
Dropped a bug in there, too,
while I was at it.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.400
You might want to
get rid of that.

35:49.468 --> 35:50.535
I got what I need.

35:50.603 --> 35:51.836
What the hell is this?

35:51.904 --> 35:53.538
I like to call it leverage.

35:53.605 --> 35:55.840
I hold your girlfriend's fate
in my hands.

35:55.908 --> 35:58.444
Here's the deal.

35:58.511 --> 36:01.547
The tape...is just icing.

36:01.615 --> 36:04.183
I have you blowing up that
building six ways from Sunday,

36:04.251 --> 36:05.985
and if you lay a hand on me,

36:06.053 --> 36:07.787
there's a guy who sends
a mountain of evidence

36:07.855 --> 36:09.723
to the CIA and MI6.

36:12.192 --> 36:14.494
I've gone to a lot of trouble
to hold all the cards today,

36:14.561 --> 36:16.429
and...that's where we are.

36:16.497 --> 36:17.864
You were behind it all?

36:17.932 --> 36:19.198
Behind Larry?

36:19.266 --> 36:21.200
Behind the consulate?

36:21.268 --> 36:22.868
Your wife?

36:22.936 --> 36:24.903
Larry didn't kill his wife.

36:24.971 --> 36:26.405
You don't think
I'd actually...

36:26.473 --> 36:28.340
blow up my <i>wife,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

36:29.609 --> 36:31.177
Who was she?

36:31.244 --> 36:33.011
What kind of question is that?
I don't know.

36:33.079 --> 36:34.146
I think her name was
"some lady."

36:36.082 --> 36:39.084
The hard part was pulling strings
to get Larry out of prison.

36:39.152 --> 36:40.452
I couldn't
let him know who I was

36:40.520 --> 36:41.720
because
I had to lead him here

36:41.788 --> 36:44.423
and to...well, me.

36:46.059 --> 36:48.595
But Larry was worth it,
though.

36:48.662 --> 36:50.297
Worth it.

36:50.364 --> 36:51.731
I saw his file.

36:51.799 --> 36:53.600
That creepy father/son thing
you two had

36:53.668 --> 36:55.369
was just
what the doctor ordered.

36:55.437 --> 36:56.771
You took quite a big risk,
Anson.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.172
He could have killed you.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.475
You still don't get it,
do you?

37:00.543 --> 37:03.145
I hired him.
I hired Larry.

37:03.213 --> 37:04.781
He didn't know it,

37:04.848 --> 37:06.749
but I've been pulling
the strings all along.

37:06.817 --> 37:09.085
No. There's no way
you could have known

37:09.153 --> 37:10.519
what would happen
back there.

37:10.587 --> 37:11.854
I couldn't?

37:11.922 --> 37:13.622
Honey, I really am
a very good psychiatrist,

37:13.690 --> 37:15.157
but I wouldn't need to be
to know

37:15.225 --> 37:18.127
that nobody brings out the
mad bomber in you like Larry.

37:20.997 --> 37:22.932
And a British flag

37:22.999 --> 37:24.567
sure wasn't gonna stop you
from killing him.

37:24.635 --> 37:26.936
I just added a couple of bombs
to the equation.

37:31.075 --> 37:32.976
Who the hell are you?

37:33.044 --> 37:36.212
I'm the last one
of them.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.848
I'm the man
who didn't want to be found,

37:38.916 --> 37:40.150
the one you missed
in Caracas.

37:41.352 --> 37:43.887
After all these years...

37:43.955 --> 37:45.155
That's it?
Hey. Hey.

37:45.223 --> 37:46.756
That's it?!

37:46.824 --> 37:49.893
I'm the one who sent Tavian
to frame you for killing Max

37:49.960 --> 37:51.461
when you wouldn't
leave well enough alone.

37:51.529 --> 37:53.230
Stay with me, Max.

37:53.298 --> 37:54.631
Max!

37:58.937 --> 38:01.239
And I'm the one
who watched you tear down

38:01.306 --> 38:03.508
every last shred of the
organization that burned you.

38:09.248 --> 38:12.550
The organization I spent
half my life building.

38:14.287 --> 38:15.587
What do you want
from us?!

38:15.655 --> 38:18.056
For starters,
I want you to let go of me.

38:18.124 --> 38:19.824
Right now.

38:21.961 --> 38:24.162
That's better.

38:24.230 --> 38:25.931
Next order of business,

38:25.999 --> 38:27.599
in your meeting tomorrow
with Agent Pearce,

38:27.667 --> 38:31.036
I expect you
to keep your mouth shut.

38:31.103 --> 38:32.437
After that,
we'll talk about

38:32.505 --> 38:33.839
all the other things
I want from you.

38:35.775 --> 38:37.709
It's a long list.

38:53.624 --> 38:55.025
Yogurt parfait.

38:55.093 --> 38:56.593
Nice choice.

38:59.397 --> 39:01.265
Max's murder
is officially closed.

39:01.333 --> 39:02.667
I'm supposed to tell you

39:02.735 --> 39:04.569
that your standing with
the Agency won't be affected.

39:04.637 --> 39:07.506
And what exactly is
my standing with the Agency?

39:07.574 --> 39:09.675
You have fans
and you have detractors.

39:09.742 --> 39:11.043
Let me guess
which side <i>you're</i> on.

39:15.181 --> 39:17.748
I do finally get to make
the call to Max's wife,

39:17.816 --> 39:19.784
give that poor woman
some closure.

39:19.851 --> 39:21.752
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

39:21.820 --> 39:24.154
When you call her,

39:24.222 --> 39:26.189
you tell her I was with him
at the end.

39:26.257 --> 39:28.992
He said he loved her.
You tell her that.

39:30.628 --> 39:33.263
You're a damn good Agent,
Pearce.

39:33.331 --> 39:35.064
Maybe I shouldn't say it,

39:35.132 --> 39:36.900
but I hope
our paths cross again.

39:36.968 --> 39:38.502
What?

39:40.238 --> 39:43.707
Michael, Langley wants to
keep using a burned spy.

39:43.775 --> 39:46.343
How many people you think they're
gonna loop in on something like that?

39:46.410 --> 39:48.912
You're still gonna be
my Agency contact.

39:48.980 --> 39:50.948
Whether either of us
likes it or not.

39:51.016 --> 39:53.817
One quick thing
before you go.

39:53.885 --> 39:55.787
I don't know
if you've noticed,

39:55.854 --> 39:57.821
but Miami has turned into
a bit of a hot spot.

39:57.889 --> 39:59.556
Yeah, I heard about this.
Are we on this?

39:59.624 --> 40:01.625
No. The feds
are running point.

40:01.693 --> 40:03.660
But...keep an ear out,
okay?

40:03.728 --> 40:04.928
Sure thing.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.869
<i>For a spy, finding out</i>
<i>you've been compromised,</i>

40:12.937 --> 40:14.838
<i>that someone</i>
<i>has something on you,</i>

40:14.906 --> 40:16.907
<i>is the ultimate nightmare.</i>

40:16.975 --> 40:18.976
<i>The worst part for someone</i>
<i>who has spent a career</i>

40:19.044 --> 40:20.712
<i>training for every situation</i>

40:20.779 --> 40:22.814
<i>is knowing that there is</i>
<i>nothing that you can do</i>

40:22.882 --> 40:25.417
<i>but grit your teeth</i>
<i>and try to figure out</i>

40:25.485 --> 40:28.787
<i>exactly how bad</i>
<i>the nightmare is going to be.</i>

40:30.624 --> 40:32.258
I watched you keep it
short and sweet

40:32.325 --> 40:33.459
with Agent Pearce today.

40:33.526 --> 40:34.660
I appreciate that.

40:34.728 --> 40:36.428
I need to know
that I can trust you.

40:36.496 --> 40:38.597
You know everything about us.
We don't know a thing about you.

40:38.664 --> 40:40.031
That's true.

40:40.099 --> 40:41.533
Once upon a time,

40:41.600 --> 40:44.101
I was just a young psychiatrist
working for the D.I.A.

40:44.169 --> 40:45.469
It was my job to evaluate

40:45.537 --> 40:46.937
the ones
who were being reassigned,

40:47.005 --> 40:49.005
who were retiring...

40:49.073 --> 40:51.208
The ones
who've been burned.

40:51.276 --> 40:55.011
I hated to see that...talent
go to waste.

40:55.079 --> 40:56.846
You were there
in the beginning.

40:56.914 --> 40:59.048
It was just me and management,
two guys with a dream.

40:59.116 --> 41:02.118
It was a dazzling idea,
like a bolt from the blue.

41:02.186 --> 41:04.320
Use burned spies

41:04.388 --> 41:05.988
to carry out ops

41:06.056 --> 41:08.758
that the legitimate intelligence
agencies wouldn't touch.

41:08.825 --> 41:10.493
And then came
Michael Westen.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.994
I should have followed
my gut.

41:12.062 --> 41:14.163
Initially,
I opposed your recruitment.

41:14.231 --> 41:15.398
What changed your mind?

41:16.966 --> 41:18.867
Something your mother said
in one of our sessions.

41:18.935 --> 41:20.502
Although, as it turns out,

41:20.570 --> 41:23.271
you were less easy to manipulate
than she led me to believe.

41:23.339 --> 41:24.739
My mother? What?

41:24.807 --> 41:26.174
I did my homework.

41:26.241 --> 41:28.376
I had to know
what makes Michael Westen tick.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.011
So, about five years ago,

41:30.079 --> 41:32.314
I arranged to substitute
for Madeline's therapist.

41:32.381 --> 41:34.182
She didn't know
who she was talking to.

41:34.250 --> 41:35.384
You son of a bitch.

41:35.452 --> 41:38.120
That's an interesting turn
of phrase.

41:38.188 --> 41:40.423
Funny how that was
on the tip of your tongue.

you <i>should</i> be upset with.

41:42.059 --> 41:45.128
The things <i>that</i> man gave us
before he passed away...

41:46.463 --> 41:47.830
What do you want from us?

41:47.898 --> 41:49.265
Look at your boyfriend,
honey.

41:49.333 --> 41:51.133
He can barely hear
a word I'm saying.

41:52.469 --> 41:55.104
Well, that's all the time
we have for today.

41:55.171 --> 41:58.006

41:58.073 --> 42:01.042
Enjoy the sunset.
