WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:07.875
Oh, my God,
it's happened!

00:07.908 --> 00:09.143
They found Tupac!

00:09.177 --> 00:11.645
No, Eddie,
you're...shaving.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.746
Oh. Yeah.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.482
Some girls at school
started calling me "Cheech,"

00:14.515 --> 00:15.649
so I figured
it was time to --

00:15.683 --> 00:18.486
"Yours is the Earth
and everything that's in it.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.922
And, which is more,
you'll be a man, my son."

00:21.955 --> 00:24.425
Rudyard Kipling.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.861
-Dad, what are you --
-Shh. I'm hugging you.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.230
Why?

00:29.263 --> 00:30.864
Because today is the day

00:30.898 --> 00:33.501
you stop being a boy
and start being a man.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.868
* Yeah

00:34.902 --> 00:37.505
Take a lip.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.907
When your mom and I found out
we were having a baby boy,

00:39.940 --> 00:41.275
you know the first thing
I did?

00:41.309 --> 00:43.244
Cried in the car
listening to James Taylor.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.445
Mom already told me.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.381
No, I drove to the drugstore
and bought two things --

00:47.415 --> 00:50.218
a roll of celebratory Mentos
for myself

00:50.251 --> 00:52.720
and a Gillette Atra Plus
for you.

00:52.753 --> 00:56.023
Eddie, I've kept that razor
in my closet for 14 years

00:56.056 --> 00:58.058
waiting for the day
you would need to use it.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.760
Today is that day!

00:59.793 --> 01:02.896
Wow, Dad, I guess this is
a big moment for me.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.898
I'm glad
you're here for it.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.534
Me, too.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.935
I'll go get your Atra.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.238
And, uh, let's put this
where it belongs.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.880
Nah. He's so happy.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.349
I'm gonna
let him have this.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.621
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:27.655 --> 01:28.789
* Fresh off the boat

01:28.822 --> 01:30.491
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:30.524 --> 01:32.793
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:32.826 --> 01:34.061
* Fresh off the boat

* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:36.430 --> 01:37.898
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:37.931 --> 01:40.634
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:44.104 --> 01:46.240
-Spectacular.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.608
Announcer: And at the end of
the first night

01:47.641 --> 01:49.143
of the Women's Figure Skating
event,

01:49.177 --> 01:52.813
it's Michelle Kwan first,
Tara Lipinski second.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.748
Ohh, yes!
Yes!
Yes!

01:54.782 --> 01:57.418
See, boys, it's just like
I'm always telling you --

01:57.451 --> 01:59.820
If you work hard,
sacrifice everything,

01:59.853 --> 02:02.190
and look good in a tight bun,
you can't lose.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.524
Michelle Kwan
is the proof.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.495
Really, Mom

02:15.203 --> 02:17.938
Tara Lipinski is too busy
flirting with boys

02:17.971 --> 02:20.007
and wiping tater-tot grease
on her leotard.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.475
I mean,
look at her face.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.844
Does that look like
the face of a winner to you?

02:25.646 --> 02:26.847
No.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.881
Evan: Mommy's right.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.450
Lipinski lacks
the self-discipline

02:29.483 --> 02:31.385
that's made Michelle Kwan
a champion.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.120
The gold
is as good as hers.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.489
Can we skip school tomorrow
and watch her win in real time?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.525
No skipping school!

02:37.558 --> 02:39.960
But I'll tape it, and you can
watch it when you get home.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.362
Now it's bedtime.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.231
You need to get your rest
so you can grow up

02:43.264 --> 02:46.133
to be small and poised
like Michelle Kwan.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
I heard she gets
nine hours a night.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.737
If we hurry,
we can make it!

02:49.770 --> 02:52.206
And after the 11:00 news,

02:52.240 --> 02:54.642
it's "The Late Show
With David Letterman"!

02:54.675 --> 02:56.009
Ha! All right!

02:56.043 --> 02:57.177
Ohh, pass.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.046
Louis, you can stay up and watch
that old man

02:59.079 --> 03:02.383
and his piano gremlin,
but I'm going to bed.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.984
You, too, Eddie.
Bedtime.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.255
Tonight Dave welcomes
supermodel Cindy Crawford.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.589
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

03:10.358 --> 03:12.760
Good night, Dad.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.428
Uh, wait.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.498
Why don't you stay up
and watch with me tonight?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.667
But my bedtime's 10:45.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.002
Well, you're shaving.
You're a man now.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.671
Maybe it's time
you had a man's bedtime.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.506
From now on,
you can stay up

03:25.539 --> 03:28.376
for the first guest on
"Letterman," until 11:45.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.177
I think you've earned
a little independence.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.945
Whoa!
Are you serious?

03:31.979 --> 03:34.248
Men are always serious.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.384
-Being a man is awesome.

03:36.417 --> 03:40.020
Do you think Dave will ask
Cindy Crawford about her mole?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.755
He might, son.
He just might.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.358
And then Letterman asked
Cindy Crawford about her mole.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.294
Whoa!

03:46.327 --> 03:48.596
I can't believe your dad
let you stay up till 11:45.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.898
I wonder when my dad
goes to sleep...

03:50.931 --> 03:52.199
or where.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.601
My dad makes me go to bed
halfway through

03:53.634 --> 03:54.802
"Walker, Texas Ranger."

03:54.835 --> 03:56.136
And that's on
a Saturday!

03:56.169 --> 03:59.139
So you never find out
if Walker catches the bad guy?

03:59.172 --> 04:02.810
It's Walker, Brian!
He catches the bad guy!

04:06.480 --> 04:07.715
Finally.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.149
I have been waiting
for someone else

04:09.182 --> 04:11.084
to have a late bedtime
forever.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.620
-Don't have one.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.055
My mom works the night shift
at the Cheesecake Factory,

04:15.088 --> 04:16.790
so I just go to bed
whenever I feel like it.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.092
Also, if somebody
sends their cheesecake back,

04:19.126 --> 04:21.762
my mom brings it home,
and we eat it for breakfast.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.831
Cool!

04:23.864 --> 04:25.499
So, what do you do
all night?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.401
I ride my bike
around the outdoor mall

04:27.435 --> 04:28.802
and eat the stale doughnuts

04:28.836 --> 04:30.471
Donut King throws away
at closing.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.440
Hold up. You're telling me
I've been sleeping through

04:32.473 --> 04:33.907
free doughnuts
this whole time?!

04:33.941 --> 04:35.576
Doughnuts, bagels.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.878
Sometimes you just get
a whole vat of glaze.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.149
Announcer: In a stunning upset,

04:42.182 --> 04:45.853
Tara Lipinski leaps over
Michelle Kwan to win the gold!

04:46.987 --> 04:50.324
Michelle Kwan...lost.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.197
How could this happen?

04:57.230 --> 04:58.866
She was supposed to win!

04:58.899 --> 05:01.001
How could she not win?!

05:01.034 --> 05:02.903
She did everything right!

05:05.406 --> 05:09.910
**

05:11.479 --> 05:14.114
Evan and Emery believe in
Michelle Kwan the winner.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.283
If they find out that
they can work that hard

05:16.316 --> 05:18.986
and still come in second,
they'll never work hard again.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.123
You know,
that's a really good idea.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.125
I do control
what they watch.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.095
So if I don't want them to know,
then they won't know.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.001
We're ready to watch the --

05:36.203 --> 05:37.337
What happened
to the tape?

05:37.371 --> 05:38.572
Technical difficulties.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.207
A mouse was living
inside the VCR

05:40.240 --> 05:42.075
and it ate the tape
and then it died.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.911
Was it a boy mouse
or a girl mouse?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.946
Who cares?!
How did Michelle do?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.818
She won!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.352
-Yes!
-Yes!

05:52.386 --> 05:53.754
Whoo!
She did it!

05:53.787 --> 05:54.855
-I knew she could!
-Whoo!

05:56.390 --> 05:57.491
Hey, Eddie.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.259
Which popcorn do you want
for "Letterman"?

05:59.292 --> 06:02.463
Butter
or movie theater butter?

06:04.297 --> 06:05.599
Eddie?

06:05.633 --> 06:08.536
Okay, top 10 reasons you should
answer your father.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.803
Number 10...

06:29.256 --> 06:30.791
Oh, out with Dave.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.860
On a school night?
Are you crazy?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.227
What were
the two of you doing?

06:34.261 --> 06:35.563
Nothing.
Just hanging out.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.233
Oh, she's gorgeous.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.735
Where do you think
she's getting ready to go?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.471
Dancing, probably.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.906
Classic girls like that
are always going dancing.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.308
I wish
I had a girl like that.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.810
That's not a girl.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.079
That's a woman.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.914
"Just hanging out"?

06:53.947 --> 06:55.082
It's almost midnight.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.818
Well, you said
my bedtime was 11:45.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.487
It's 11:40.
I still have five minutes.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.654
No,
I said you could stay up

07:00.688 --> 07:02.456
to watch the first guest
on "Letterman,"

07:02.490 --> 07:03.557
not run around the streets

07:03.591 --> 07:05.392
doing God knows what
with your friends.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.561
But you said I'd earned
a little independence.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.062
This is not what I meant.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.499
Well, I hope whatever
you were doing was worth it

07:11.532 --> 07:14.234
because you missed Dave
interviewing Andie MacDowell.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.136
So?
I'll just watch it tomorrow.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.572
Andie MacDowell is not
going to be on tomorrow.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.108
I don't care about
Andie MacDowell!

07:23.977 --> 07:27.247
Clearly we're both tired
and saying things we don't mean.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.516
Let's just go to bed,

07:28.549 --> 07:30.350
and we'll talk about this
in the morning.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.819
No!

07:31.852 --> 07:33.153
We will not talk about this
in the morning

07:33.186 --> 07:34.655
because I didn't do
anything wrong!

07:34.688 --> 07:36.857
You can't talk to me
like that.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.092
Why not?
You said I'm a man, remember?

07:39.126 --> 07:42.362
Maybe it's time you started
treating me like one.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.269
Oh, this is interesting.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.871
Michelle Kwan
tried to start a band.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.005
Third Eye Kwan?

07:52.039 --> 07:53.306
That's in this book, too.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.875
She's so talented.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.944
I just wish the TV and the VCR
weren't broken

07:56.977 --> 07:59.046
so we could watch a replay
of her winning.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.148
I can't believe
we still haven't seen it.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.684
It's also unfortunate that
all the newspapers on the street

08:03.717 --> 08:05.318
have been stolen
by a news thief.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.790
USA! USA!

08:10.891 --> 08:12.392
Can you guys believe
she won gold?!

08:12.425 --> 08:14.061
It's exciting, right?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.729
I know.
Michelle Kwan's our hero.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.565
Michelle Kwan? No.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.232
Tara Lipinski won gold.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.134
Michelle Kwan came in second.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.302
That's why they're doing
a special

08:22.335 --> 08:24.404
on Lipinski cuts
at the mall.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.008
No, Honey. Michelle Kwan won.
Right, Mom?

08:30.377 --> 08:32.145
Boys...

08:32.179 --> 08:34.147
...the truth is...

08:34.181 --> 08:35.716
Michelle Kwan didn't win.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.187
Because that wasn't
the real Michelle Kwan!

08:41.555 --> 08:45.525
The real Michelle Kwan has been
replaced by an imposter!

08:45.559 --> 08:47.427
-Think about it.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.496
She trains hard
her whole life.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.832
She wins
the world championships.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.668
Then she goes to the Olympics
and comes in second place?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.003
It doesn't add up.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.071
Has "Lipinski"
written all over it.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.407
The point is
the fake Kwan lost.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.876
The real Kwan
will always be the best.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.778
Let's never
speak of this again.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.348
I can't believe it.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.750
A fake Michelle Kwan.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.952
What do we do?

09:11.985 --> 09:14.855
Use her focus and determination
to get to the bottom of it?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.256
Then we will, too.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.191
We'll be like Woodward
and Bernstein.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.060
Or Chip 'n Dale!

09:20.093 --> 09:22.763
Do you think
Jessica's coming back?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.700
He missed Andie MacDowell,
huh?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.201
-She's a ruddy-cheeked delight.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.870
And he wouldn't
apologize!

09:29.903 --> 09:32.305
I don't know what's
gotten into him lately.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.041
Sure, he and Jessica
clash a lot,

09:34.074 --> 09:36.543
but Eddie and I
have always been pals.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.379
He's never been so openly
defiant to me before.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.548
How old's the boy?
9

09:41.581 --> 09:43.450
He's 14, Marvin.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.952
Ah, 14.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.453
Then that explains it.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.721
It does?

09:47.755 --> 09:50.724
Classic male adolescent elephant
power vacuum.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.392
-Follow me, Lou.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.561
There's something
you need to see.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.131
Now we're cooking with Crisco!

09:59.499 --> 10:01.669
Ah!
I was stationed in Africa,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.837
overseeing the construction
of the railway

10:03.871 --> 10:06.473
from Mombasa to Kisumu.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.108
The railway?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.609
How old are you?

10:09.643 --> 10:11.679
Old enough to know
what you're going through.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.146
Look.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.982
Adolescent male elephants.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.952
Now, see, when the herd lacks
a strong older male presence,

10:18.986 --> 10:22.690
the young males become unruly
and defiant, even violent.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.692
See -- See them shaking
their heads and trumpeting?

10:24.725 --> 10:25.993
That means they're angry.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.995
Why didn't you run away?
They could have trampled you.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.130
Because running away
is what they want,

10:30.163 --> 10:32.099
and it's the worst thing
you can do.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.868
He's so used to
getting his own way

10:34.902 --> 10:38.872
that when you show confidence
and stand your own ground,

10:38.906 --> 10:40.207
he's surprised.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.374
He'll back down.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.475
Watch.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.081
-Wow. It worked.
Yeah!

10:49.482 --> 10:51.618
And it'll work
for you and Eddie, too.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.486
You've been too soft
on that boy, Lou.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.955
I don't know.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.457
My dad was extremely tough on me
when I was Eddie's age,

10:57.490 --> 10:59.793
and our relationship
never recovered.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.795
Eddie and I aren't like that.
We're friends.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.630
Okay, so maybe your dad
wasn't your best friend,

11:03.663 --> 11:05.032
but look how
you turned out.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.801
You're a very successful
small-business owner

11:07.835 --> 11:09.669
with your own home,
great family.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.972
Fathers can't be friends
with their sons.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.908
Not if they want them to grow up
to be responsible adults.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.977
So, what do I do?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.046
Well, you have to be
the angry bull elephant.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.582
Only discipline can
bring the herd back together.

11:22.615 --> 11:29.522
**

11:29.556 --> 11:31.058
What's going on?

11:31.091 --> 11:34.327
We did some research
at the library

11:34.361 --> 11:35.662
on your Kwan-impostor
theory.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.397
Okay, look,
I was just --

11:37.430 --> 11:39.166
And you were
absolutely right!

11:39.199 --> 11:41.334
Emery, let's bring her
up to speed.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.337
Michelle Kwan wins
the 1998 world championships

11:44.371 --> 11:47.674
with 15 perfect 6.0s,

11:47.707 --> 11:49.943
leaving one judge
in tears.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.612
She's the favorite for the gold
medal in the Winter Olympics.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.681
Then things start
getting fishy.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.018
She arrives in Japan
but processes through Tokyo

11:58.051 --> 12:00.420
instead of Osaka
with all the other athletes.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.290
Right, yeah.
That's -- That's weird.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.393
Nobody sees Michelle Kwan
at the Olympic Village

12:06.426 --> 12:11.131
because -- get this --
she's staying "off site."

12:11.164 --> 12:13.934
Next, she misses
the Opening Ceremony.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.103
She works her whole life
to get to the Olympics

12:16.136 --> 12:18.571
and then doesn't go to
the Opening Ceremony?

12:18.605 --> 12:19.873
It doesn't add up.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.109
No, it doesn't, actually.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.478
The night before the event,
nobody sees Michelle Kwan.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.647
Where's Tara Lipinski,
on the other hand?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.083
In bed getting
a full eight hours?

12:30.117 --> 12:33.553
With Wayne Gretzky
and the Canadian Ice Hokey team

12:33.586 --> 12:34.621
eating ice cream!

12:34.654 --> 12:36.890
Like she knew
she couldn't lose.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.228
And Michelle Kwan
was photographed

12:41.261 --> 12:43.797
at her hotel
at 9:30 a.m.,

12:43.831 --> 12:46.934
15 minutes before she was seen
at the Olympic arena --

12:46.967 --> 12:49.336
a distance of 34 miles.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.337
So?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.505
So,
I just drove from here

12:52.539 --> 12:54.741
to the Sea World parking lot
as fast as I could.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.343
It's exactly 34 miles.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.846
It took me way longer
than 15 minutes,

12:58.879 --> 13:01.481
and I didn't even stop
for red lights.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.416
Rearrange the letters
in "Tara Lipinski,"

13:03.450 --> 13:04.484
and what do you get?

13:04.517 --> 13:05.853
Tarantula Kiss!

13:05.886 --> 13:08.421
Rink Alias?!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.958
It's like she's daring us
to catch her.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.194
Michelle Kwan really was
replaced by an imposter.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.663
Unfortunately,
it's just a theory.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.131
Nobody knows for sure.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.767
Actually,
I know someone who might.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.002
I used to do makeup for

13:22.035 --> 13:24.604
the Broadway on Ice production
of "Cats" years ago,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.206
and there is one figure skater
who knows

13:26.239 --> 13:28.775
everything that goes on
with everyone in that world.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.543
If something fishy happened
in Nagano,

13:30.577 --> 13:31.811
she'll know about it.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.684
Okay,
so it's 10:30 now.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.453
I figure we head to the outdoor
mall for an hour or so

13:40.487 --> 13:43.223
and then ride our bikes from the
Big Dog outlet to the Wet Seal.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.858
I have a better idea.

13:44.892 --> 13:45.893
We steal her.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.628
Who?
Her.
The girl from the window.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.963
The mannequin?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.564
It hit me the other night.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.300
What if the place she's been
getting ready to go

13:53.333 --> 13:55.368
all this time
is my house?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.137
I don't know, Dave.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.338
That's, like,
breaking and entering.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.907
So?
It'll be fun!

13:59.940 --> 14:02.309
You said you'd love to have
a girl like her.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.810
Remember?
You said it.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.578
Come on, Eddie.
Say you'll help me.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.813
Come on. Say it.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.715
-I don't know.
-Say it!

14:08.748 --> 14:10.583
Uh, sure.
Sounds like fun.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.385
Great.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.355
Now let's listen to a little
GWAR to pump ourselves up.

14:18.858 --> 14:23.163
Discipline will bring the herd
back together.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.431
**

14:25.565 --> 14:28.201
Not cool, Dave.
My parents are asleep.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.238
Eddie, you may be taller than me
now, slightly,

14:31.271 --> 14:32.505
but I am still
your father.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.606
And when you go out,

14:33.640 --> 14:34.908
I want to know
where you're going,

14:34.942 --> 14:36.509
who you're with,
and when you'll be back.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.011
No more
doing whatever you want,

14:38.045 --> 14:39.279
and no more talking back,
either.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.414
Otherwise,
you won't be going anywhere.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.882
Do we understand
each other?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.387
Screw...you!

14:53.293 --> 14:54.427
That's it, Eddie.
You're grounded!

14:54.461 --> 14:55.562
-I think I'm gonna go.
-Good idea.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.964
I don't know what's
gotten into you lately,

14:56.997 --> 14:58.765
but this behavior
stops now.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.200
I thought we could
get through this as friends,

15:00.233 --> 15:01.568
but clearly I was wrong.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.703
So from now on,
we do things the hard way.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.139
No more TV.
No more video games!

15:06.173 --> 15:07.874
Thanks, Dad.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.042
What are you doing?!

15:09.076 --> 15:10.210
I'm hugging you.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.578
Why?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.213
I knew that if I talked back
to you like that,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.581
you'd be so shocked
you'd ground me,

15:14.614 --> 15:17.384
and I wouldn't have to help Dave
steal that sexy mannequin.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.052
Help Dave do what?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.154
It was his idea to steal it,
and it's crazy.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.455
I didn't want to do it.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.724
But I-I didn't know
how to tell him.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.895
He's been...
intense lately.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.999
Hey, you want to see
something cool?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.467
-Sure.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.737
I'm gonna bust open
this Stretch Armstrong

15:37.770 --> 15:38.771
with a baseball bat.

15:38.805 --> 15:39.772
Um...

15:42.275 --> 15:44.011
No, y don't have a dad!

15:45.612 --> 15:48.581
So, you're not
the adolescent elephant.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.616
Dave is.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.018
Dad,
you're all over the place.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.152
What do you mean?

15:52.185 --> 15:54.354
First, you made a big deal
out of me shaving.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.922
Then you let me
stay up later.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.291
Then you got mad at me
for staying up later.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.792
And now you're talking about
elephants.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.828
I'm sorry.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.531
I was just excited
for you to become a man

16:04.564 --> 16:05.532
because I thought
that would mean

16:05.565 --> 16:06.866
us spending more time
together.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.801
Then you decided to
spend your extra hour

16:08.835 --> 16:09.936
with Dave
instead of me.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.638
So you're upset
because I didn't stay home

16:11.671 --> 16:12.772
and watch "Letterman"
with you.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.442
Look, I just don't
want us to grow apart

16:15.475 --> 16:17.677
because that's what happened
with me and my dad.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.646
Just because I want to
do something on my own

16:19.679 --> 16:21.614
doesn't mean
I don't still need you, Dad.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.350
You and I are friends.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.817
I'm always gonna need that.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.791
Wait, you and Dave haven't
stolen anything else, have you?

16:31.824 --> 16:32.825
No way!

16:32.859 --> 16:34.627
I know a good idea
from a bad one.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.896
I'm lucky to have you around
to teach me stuff like that.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.132
Not everyone's that lucky.

16:39.166 --> 16:44.971
**

16:45.004 --> 16:50.843
**

16:50.877 --> 16:54.347
So, whatcha waitin' for, Chief?

16:58.551 --> 17:00.053
Louis: Stop!

17:00.087 --> 17:01.721
Yeah. Stop.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.590
Now, why don't you
put the brick down, Dave,

17:03.623 --> 17:04.924
and we can talk
about this?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.262
Marvin:
He's so used to getting his way

17:09.296 --> 17:11.331
that when he sees you
showing confidence

17:11.364 --> 17:14.000
and standing your ground,
he'll back down.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.769
Dave, you cut this behavior out
right this minute.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.338
Do you hear me?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.906
I'm going to give you
to the count of three

17:19.939 --> 17:23.042
to put the brick down and to
step away from the mannequin.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.645
One...

17:27.580 --> 17:28.848
Two...

17:28.881 --> 17:35.088
**

17:35.122 --> 17:36.689
Whoa.
Good work, Dad.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.858
Grab that brick.
We need a doorstop.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.127
Uh, okay.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.494
Go. Go.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.930
Jessica: Excuse me.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.365
Excuse me. Out of the way.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.467
Coming through.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.635
Oh!

17:48.668 --> 17:50.103
Hello,
Nancy Kerrigan.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.538
Thanks for
the enthusiasm.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.373
It's nice to meet you.
Who can I make this out to?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.875
Is it true Tara Lipinski
replaced Michelle Kwan

17:55.908 --> 17:57.910
with an impostor
so she could steal the gold?

17:57.944 --> 17:59.979
Uh, well,
that's quite a lot.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.481
How about,
"Believe in yourself"?

18:01.514 --> 18:04.151
What we really need, Nancy,
is answers.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.218
Is it true?

18:05.252 --> 18:06.886
What makes you think
I know?

18:06.919 --> 18:07.987
Because
you're the hub of

18:08.020 --> 18:09.556
the professional ice-skating
world, Kerrigan.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.057
You know everything
that goes on.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.126
Hi. Honey Ellis.
-Hi.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.327
I did your makeup
when you played

18:14.361 --> 18:16.496
Grizabella the Glamour Cat
in Broadway on Ice.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.165
Big fan.
-Oh, right.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.066
Weren't you dating one of
the lighting technicians?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.734
Yes!
It didn't work out.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.571
Of course it didn't.
So, is it true?

18:24.604 --> 18:27.174
Tell me
what you think you know.

18:27.207 --> 18:31.010
Tara Lipinski replaced
the real Michelle Kwan

18:31.043 --> 18:33.413
with a slightly less talented
body double.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.081
That's why the fake
Michelle Kwan

18:35.114 --> 18:37.250
flew into Tokyo,
instead of Osaka.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.352
That's why she missed
the Opening Ceremonies.

18:39.386 --> 18:42.422
And that's why
she was kept "off site."

18:42.455 --> 18:44.824
Look,
Michelle flew into Tokyo

18:44.857 --> 18:46.693
because her pen pal Gabby
lives there

18:46.726 --> 18:48.495
and offered to drive her
from the airport.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.198
Also, flights are way cheaper
if she left mid-week,

18:51.231 --> 18:53.633
and if you know Michelle,
she likes a bargain.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.102
So that's why she missed
the Opening Ceremonies.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.471
Also, she didn't stay
in the Olympic Village

18:58.505 --> 19:01.941
because the Men's Ice Hockey
team throws really loud parties,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.443
and that's why
she got a hotel.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.479
But what about getting from
the hotel to the Olympic arena?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.281
Mm-hmm.
She was photographed
at the hotel

19:08.315 --> 19:10.049
15 minutes
before her event.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.118
There's no way she could make it
in 15 minutes.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.953
That wasn't Michelle
at the hotel that morning.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.355
That was her sister,
Karen.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.456
They look alike.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.024
Michelle didn't even
stay at the hotel

19:18.057 --> 19:19.292
the night before the event.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.461
She didn't?
Where did she stay?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.696
Where she always stays
the night before a big event --

19:23.730 --> 19:25.131
on the ice.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.199
-Oh!
-Oh...

19:26.233 --> 19:27.400
That's what I would do.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.869
But that couldn't have been
the real Michelle Kwan.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.137
But it was.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.139
Michelle Kwan trained
her whole life to win gold.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.707
She sacrificed everything.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.477
How could she possibly
come in second place?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.246
Sometimes
life isn't fair.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.248
Believe me.
I know all about that.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.815
And crazy conspiracies.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.818
You can work really hard,
do everything right,

19:45.852 --> 19:47.987
and sometimes life
just throws you a Lipinski.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.758
You just have to pick yourself
back up and keep on skating.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.726
Thanks for coming out.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.795
Appreciate it.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.930
I like your Kerribun.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.401
Oh, it's not --
It -- Thank you.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.004
Jessica,
are you okay?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.673
No, I'm not.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.107
Everything I know --

20:08.140 --> 20:09.576
Everything
I've taught my children --

20:09.609 --> 20:11.844
My whole worldview
is wrong.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.447
Wait. Mommy, look!

20:19.452 --> 20:24.056
So Tara Lipinski did replace
Michelle Kwan with an impostor!

20:24.090 --> 20:25.191
I knew it!

20:25.224 --> 20:27.193
There's no way
somebody who works that hard

20:27.226 --> 20:28.595
comes in second place.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.062
It just isn't possible.

20:30.096 --> 20:39.606
**

20:39.639 --> 20:43.710
You know, your Sharpie is
slightly thinner than hers.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.211
It worked, didn't it?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
The truth that Michelle Kwan
did everything right

20:47.280 --> 20:49.316
and still lost
would crush mom.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.250
She needs to believe.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.923
You know what,
you go ahead.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.791
I'm gonna stick around
for this.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.192
Hmm.

21:03.029 --> 21:06.733
Announcer:
Tonight, Dave welcomes
the cast of "Baywatch."

21:06.766 --> 21:08.267
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!

21:08.301 --> 21:09.636
I'm gonna go
grab a soda.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.238
Uh, no soda
after 9:00 p.m.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.606
Okay, Mr. Huang.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.843
Hey, how about,
just for tonight,

21:16.876 --> 21:18.945
I let you boys stay up
to watch the musical guest?

21:18.978 --> 21:21.080
...with musical guest
Paula Cole!

21:21.113 --> 21:23.082
Nah, we're good.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.353
**

21:26.386 --> 21:27.854
I think that's a good idea.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.322
Hmm.
