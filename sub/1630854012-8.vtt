WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.699
<i>Someone's been
spying on us, Pat.</i>

00:12.621 --> 00:15.885
I need Courtney Whitmore.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.322
Courtney!

00:19.541 --> 00:21.412
Jennie, what's going on?

00:21.412 --> 00:23.806
My ring was corrupted
by the Shade's shadows,

00:23.806 --> 00:25.764
<i>and now the darkness
is leaking into it.</i>

00:25.764 --> 00:29.768
Jennie needs to exorcise
the darkness from her ring.

00:29.768 --> 00:30.769
You can help me overcome

00:30.769 --> 00:31.770
the darkness within me.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.294
No!

00:33.294 --> 00:34.904
<i>I finally found my brother.</i>

00:34.904 --> 00:36.166
<i>No!</i>
Ah!

00:36.166 --> 00:38.081
<i>And he needs our help.</i>

00:38.081 --> 00:39.126
[distorted] If you
take me out of this room,

00:39.126 --> 00:40.431
I'll destroy the world.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.432
I'm not leaving you here!

00:42.781 --> 00:46.002
Ah!

00:46.002 --> 00:47.873
Courtney! Look out!

00:47.873 --> 00:49.484
Pat!

01:05.761 --> 01:08.198
Hey,
are we in the Shadowlands?

01:08.198 --> 01:11.114
Yes, because you insisted
on helping

01:11.114 --> 01:13.073
those irksome children.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.858
More proof that no good deed
goes unpunished.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.512
How did we get here?

01:17.512 --> 01:19.775
Alan Scott's daughter
has the power of light,

01:19.775 --> 01:22.734
but his son,
for reasons I don't understand,

01:22.734 --> 01:26.086
has the power of the shadows,
like me.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.524
Me coming into direct contact
caused some kind of feedback,

01:29.524 --> 01:31.352
which seems
to have banished us here.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.310
Okay,
we gotta find a way back.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.272
That--that's a brilliant strategy.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.317
I'm truly watching
a master at work.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.927
Hey, Swift,
I'm doing the best that I can--

01:41.927 --> 01:43.581
No, no, please,
please don't apologize.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.366
I can think enough
for the two of us.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.845
Lucky for you,

01:46.845 --> 01:48.804
you're with the sole being
in existence

01:48.804 --> 01:51.154
that knows how to escape
this dreadful place.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.895
Come now.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.984
Let's get home.

02:03.384 --> 02:06.604
Okay then.

02:06.604 --> 02:10.260
I'll do it... right here.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.190
Ah!

02:27.190 --> 02:28.583
Swift!

02:28.583 --> 02:30.628
You okay? Huh?

02:32.108 --> 02:34.023
No.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.025
It seems until Jennie's ring

02:36.025 --> 02:41.204
is free from its corruption,
I'm as useless as...

02:41.204 --> 02:42.553
you.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.338
Ugh.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.857
It's okay, Kritter.

03:25.857 --> 03:26.902
We're okay.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.562
Good God, what now?

03:51.013 --> 03:52.362
It hurts.

03:54.103 --> 03:57.237
Todd? You can control this.

03:57.237 --> 04:01.110
Focus on your sister,
your family.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.331
Family.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.945
What's wrong with you, Todd?

04:15.516 --> 04:17.039
You like boys?

04:18.519 --> 04:21.043
That's sick.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.959
No wonder your real father
didn't want you.

04:23.959 --> 04:27.832
And me? I run my group home
for normal kids.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.660
You're filth.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.358
Tainted.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.230
You'll be alone forever.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.319
We're gonna fix your sins.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.365
I'll beat 'em out of you

04:38.365 --> 04:40.367
for as long as it takes.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.455
Todd!

05:59.402 --> 06:00.708
The hell?

06:09.151 --> 06:10.674
You have caused

06:10.674 --> 06:13.938
quite a lot of trouble tonight,
young lady.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.766
What's going on?

06:15.766 --> 06:17.377
Where are my friends?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.118
I didn't hear a "ma'am"
in there anywhere.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.598
Such disrespect.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.384
Oh, you wanna talk
about disrespect?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.124
How about lying to us?

06:26.124 --> 06:27.474
You said Todd wasn't here.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.695
All right, I lied.

06:31.695 --> 06:35.133
But you don't understand
how necessary it was.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.700
Necessary?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.572
His sister's been looking
for him everywhere

06:38.572 --> 06:41.966
going out of her mind--

06:41.966 --> 06:43.446
where is she?

06:43.446 --> 06:46.318
Jennie-Lynn is safe
for the moment,

06:46.318 --> 06:49.060
but her brother...

06:49.060 --> 06:51.411
Your drop-in visit tonight

06:51.411 --> 06:54.370
interrupted
a very important procedure,

06:54.370 --> 06:59.288
and now you have endangered
everyone, including him.

06:59.288 --> 07:02.378
Jennie-Lynn may
burn down buildings

07:02.378 --> 07:04.598
in her weaker moments,
but Todd?

07:06.382 --> 07:08.950
The whole world could
be swallowed up in shadow

07:08.950 --> 07:12.040
if we don't get him
under control.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.827
We are going to help him,

07:16.827 --> 07:18.916
and you're going home, Stargirl.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.530
I'm not going anywhere.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.575
My dad--

07:25.575 --> 07:27.272
Pat.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.839
I think Todd
sent him and the Shade

07:28.839 --> 07:31.494
into the Shadowlands.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.061
The Shadowlands?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.630
What Pat
could be going through,

07:36.630 --> 07:39.241
it could kill him.

07:39.241 --> 07:43.375
It's horrible. I've been there.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.508
You've been to this place?

07:45.508 --> 07:48.206
It's where the Shade
gets his power from,

07:48.206 --> 07:49.817
and Todd, it looks like.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.299
You shouldn't have come here.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.390
Wait.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.392
Ugh!

08:17.627 --> 08:19.455
Whatever's happening
on the other side,

08:19.455 --> 08:23.067
Jennie's ring is still
connected to the Shadowlands.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.637
That isn't normal.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.596
I mean, is there anything
normal in this town?

08:29.596 --> 08:31.989
Believe it or not,
the Shadowlands has rules,

08:31.989 --> 08:34.165
and you'd better learn them.
- All right.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.950
For one thing,
this place preys

08:35.950 --> 08:37.734
on your subconscious;

08:37.734 --> 08:39.301
your fears and regrets.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.955
While I, of course,
don't harbor

08:40.955 --> 08:43.610
such worthless emotions,
I'm quite sure that you do.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.569
And if you give into them,

08:46.569 --> 08:48.571
it could jeopardize us both.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.007
You're keeping up with this, yes?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.488
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
I understand.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.316
Also, doorways here,

08:54.316 --> 08:57.014
they usually take you
where you most desire to go,

08:57.014 --> 08:59.713
taking their cues
from the subconscious.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.324
It rarely turns out
for the best.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.634
If I can't get us home
the way I did before,

09:07.634 --> 09:10.419
our only hope is to...
keep moving,

09:10.419 --> 09:12.290
avoiding the hungry wraiths

09:12.290 --> 09:14.292
your insecurities
will no doubt conjure up

09:14.292 --> 09:16.599
until I can...

09:16.599 --> 09:18.645
I can find a way out.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.006
It should have taken us
somewhere else.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.616
Why?

09:33.616 --> 09:37.489
Because the diner
is insignificant to me.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.796
Well,
that's not entirely true.

09:52.809 --> 09:55.943
This is where you refused
to forgive me.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.640
Isn't it, Mr. Swift?

09:59.163 --> 10:01.035
- Gambler...
- It's not him.

10:01.035 --> 10:04.560
It's a construct.
- Sure looks like him.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.216
It's awfully hypocritical
of you not to forgive me.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.653
Wouldn't you say?
- Ignore him.

10:10.653 --> 10:13.090
You caused your sister
so much pain,

10:13.090 --> 10:15.615
yet she still forgave you,
didn't she?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.181
Enough.

10:17.181 --> 10:20.010
Sweet, dear Emily.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.927
What did you say to her
on the day she died?

10:25.886 --> 10:28.192
Do you remember?
- Out.

10:29.585 --> 10:30.673
- Go!
- Where?

10:30.673 --> 10:31.674
Away from him.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.293
Oh.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.687
From one grease pit to another.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.259
Damn it.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.883
Who is that?

11:12.323 --> 11:15.718
Well, what are you
standing around for?

11:15.718 --> 11:17.981
Grab a wrench.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.809
Dad?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.425
- Todd!
- Jennie!

11:27.425 --> 11:30.341
- No!
- No!

11:33.910 --> 11:35.172
No!

11:49.186 --> 11:50.579
Hello?

12:13.863 --> 12:15.299
Let me out of here!

12:32.055 --> 12:35.145
<i>PA system: This room is
designed for your protection</i>

12:35.145 --> 12:37.321
<i>and ours.</i>

12:37.321 --> 12:38.670
<i>The walls are coated</i>

12:38.670 --> 12:40.716
<i>with an energy defusing polymer</i>

12:40.716 --> 12:44.111
<i>to assist in power control
and suppression.</i>

12:44.111 --> 12:46.722
Whoever the hell you are,
open the door!

12:46.722 --> 12:49.072
<i>PA system:
I'm a friend, Ms. Hayden.</i>

12:49.072 --> 12:51.379
<i>I'm an ally to both you
and your brother.</i>

12:57.341 --> 13:00.257
<i>I only want
what's best for you both.</i>

13:00.257 --> 13:02.042
Let me out of here.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.826
<i>PA system: I'm sorry,</i>

13:03.826 --> 13:07.090
<i>but you and Todd
can never be together again.</i>

13:33.421 --> 13:35.597
Damn thing keeps overheating.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.425
Sarge is gonna have my ass

13:37.425 --> 13:39.514
unless I get her
up and running.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.864
You wanna help me, son?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.866
I always tried to.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.215
You did try.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.217
Remember the garage
on the base?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.480
You were always at my side.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.352
We should go, Pat.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.269
You were like
a tick on a dog, son.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.360
Every time
you tried to fix something,

13:59.360 --> 14:00.665
you made it worse,

14:00.665 --> 14:02.493
like our family.

14:02.493 --> 14:05.235
You should have brought me
and your mom closer together,

14:05.235 --> 14:08.325
but instead,
she pushed me away.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.240
I was too hard on you.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.373
She worried
about your feelings.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.857
Made you weak.
Stand up straight, would you?

14:23.036 --> 14:25.125
I was never proud

14:25.125 --> 14:27.475
to call you my son.

14:31.479 --> 14:34.047
This is the Shadowlands.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.788
A nightmare version
of the people in our lives.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.269
It twists their words.
- No.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.619
Not this time, Shade.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.013
My real father
spoke every word of this.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.233
You've always been worthless,

14:46.233 --> 14:49.323
playing second fiddle
to everyone in your life.

14:49.323 --> 14:53.588
You've never been a standout,
a leader,

14:53.588 --> 14:55.372
have you?

14:55.372 --> 14:56.678
We need to go.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.813
Still miss you, Pop.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.295
Don't turn your back on me.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.515
I should've been harder on you.

15:26.882 --> 15:27.927
No.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.234
What is it?

15:32.670 --> 15:34.629
Nothing that I care to see.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.502
Ah!

15:38.502 --> 15:41.766
Dickie, is that you?

15:47.598 --> 15:49.905
Have you come to say goodbye?

15:53.778 --> 15:56.259
Don't let me die alone.

15:56.259 --> 16:00.089
Not like Father.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.529
Don't ignore me.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.014
Please.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.842
Say something.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.205
Ah!

16:29.205 --> 16:31.468
Shade.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.210
I know it's difficult
to lose people that you love.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.733
Yes, spare me

16:35.733 --> 16:38.998
your bleeding-heart sentiments, please.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.348
Courtney survived
the Shadowlands because--

16:41.348 --> 16:42.697
Because of me.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.960
She got out because of you.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.571
She survived because of her.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.443
She had to face
her own darkness

16:49.443 --> 16:51.793
in order to get past it.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.839
You're telling me
about the darkness?

16:54.839 --> 16:57.059
I'm just saying,
maybe the key here

16:57.059 --> 16:58.756
is to face things.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.062
You don't run away.

17:09.332 --> 17:12.553
I'm incapable
of feeling anything.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.279
Have you been watching us?

17:46.500 --> 17:50.069
In our town, our school,
our--our homes?

17:54.160 --> 17:57.467
You picked the wrong people
to do this to, you know that?

18:00.688 --> 18:03.125
They're going to find you
if they haven't already.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.041
Starman,
the Justice Society of America,

18:06.041 --> 18:07.869
all of our friends.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.914
They'll be coming for us.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.046
For you.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.747
Y-you think I'm helpless
without my staff.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.706
I'm not.

18:18.706 --> 18:22.449
<i>PA system:
No, but that's the point.</i>

18:22.449 --> 18:24.625
<i>You can set the staff aside.</i>

18:24.625 --> 18:27.845
<i>Just as Yolanda
can put Wildcat's suit away.</i>

18:27.845 --> 18:30.935
<i>Rick the hourglass,
Beth her goggles.</i>

18:30.935 --> 18:33.851
<i>You're not like Jennie
and her brother.</i>

18:33.851 --> 18:36.332
<i>You're not like me.</i>

18:36.332 --> 18:39.292
I don't even know
who you are.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.392
You'll have to try harder
if you want to scare me.

18:52.392 --> 18:56.004
My appearance is not
a choice I can make.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.398
My mother was subjected
to experiments

18:58.398 --> 19:00.008
while pregnant with me.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.188
Beyond my flesh
being transparent,

19:06.188 --> 19:09.322
I was born with a...
cyanide touch,

19:09.322 --> 19:11.019
these doctors called it.

19:14.153 --> 19:18.983
Anything I come
into contact with dies.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.682
That included my mother.

19:21.682 --> 19:25.729
Nurse Love rescued me
from the people who did this.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.297
But there was nothing
to be done.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.256
I'm sorry, I really am, but--

19:30.256 --> 19:33.433
I am as cursed
as Jennie and Todd,

19:33.433 --> 19:35.826
unlike you and your friends.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.611
We were born this way.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.918
Here at Helix,

19:40.918 --> 19:44.574
we help those like us learn
to live a life of isolation.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.970
You teach them
how to hide from the world?

19:48.970 --> 19:52.974
We help our patients survive
the only way they can.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.628
Alone.

19:54.628 --> 19:57.413
When Jennie's ring was infected
by the shadows,

19:57.413 --> 20:01.156
it connected her to Todd,
and his power became unstable.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.941
If we cannot suppress
Todd's power,

20:03.941 --> 20:05.987
he will destroy us all.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.791
Shade, you okay?

20:27.791 --> 20:31.186
Traveling through the fire
like that, I don't--

20:31.186 --> 20:33.101
I don't think
I can do it again.

20:36.757 --> 20:40.021
Emily asked
if I'd come say goodbye.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.939
But the truth is, I didn't say
anything to my sister

20:44.939 --> 20:47.202
the day she died
'cause I wasn't there.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.249
I wasn't there.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.427
I couldn't, you see.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.559
I had to separate myself
from her.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.217
Losing people is just too hard.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.653
Forget that limey.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.440
We're not done, son.

21:11.574 --> 21:14.229
Jennie's still
too close to Todd.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.362
We need to take her
far from here.

21:17.754 --> 21:20.104
Maybe I wasn't born
like Jennie or Todd

21:20.104 --> 21:23.760
or you, but I know
what it's like to lose family,

21:23.760 --> 21:26.502
to feel so flawed
you must have pushed them away.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.113
I've carried that curse too.

21:29.113 --> 21:33.553
But Jennie and Todd
are meant to be together.

21:33.553 --> 21:36.643
I saw her powers reacting
to his hurting.

21:36.643 --> 21:40.473
She's the light he needs,
not those lamps.

21:40.473 --> 21:43.606
My power, Jennie's,

21:43.606 --> 21:46.348
it all reacts to how we feel.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.046
That's why I think
Todd's connection with Jennie

21:49.046 --> 21:51.658
is the only thing
that can save him.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.752
It also might be the one thing
that brings Pat home.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.930
Look,
I know what you're doing here,

22:02.930 --> 22:05.759
and I understand why, I do.

22:05.759 --> 22:09.371
But life isn't about living
in isolation.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.851
It can't be.

22:11.982 --> 22:15.029
Because if we're alone...

22:15.029 --> 22:16.813
what's the point of anything?

22:25.996 --> 22:28.303
If you're wrong,

22:28.303 --> 22:29.783
we all die.

22:49.846 --> 22:52.675
Jennie, are you all right?

22:52.675 --> 22:54.982
Courtney, where's Todd?

22:54.982 --> 22:57.114
Waiting for you.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.682
You need to be with him.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.163
- But when I touched him, it--
- You both were frightened.

23:02.163 --> 23:05.732
And you know what that does
to you and the fire.

23:05.732 --> 23:09.344
For Todd, well, he became...

23:09.344 --> 23:12.434
a living doorway
to the Shadowlands, I think.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.657
What can we do?

23:17.657 --> 23:20.224
Do what we did for you.

23:20.224 --> 23:23.358
Stand with him. Don't go away.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.447
Have faith.

23:47.034 --> 23:50.211
You think I'm a bad father, Pat.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.995
But look at your son.

23:54.171 --> 23:57.610
He does everything he can
to get your attention.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.788
Just like you did with me.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.052
But you don't see Mike
at all,

24:05.052 --> 24:07.402
so like you,
he feels worthless.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.452
Don't.
Don't listen to them, Pat.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.324
You're gonna die alone,
Mr. Swift,

24:16.324 --> 24:17.630
like your sister.

24:19.675 --> 24:23.287
No one's gonna say goodbye
because you haven't earned it.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.854
You shouldn't be here.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.510
She'll never really be his mom.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.994
Mike's mom abandoned him
when he was what?

24:33.994 --> 24:36.475
Three or four years old?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.694
She got strung out and left him

24:38.694 --> 24:40.479
at a soup kitchen.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.527
You got Mike and left

24:45.527 --> 24:48.748
and never spoke
about Mommy again.

24:48.748 --> 24:52.099
You wanted him to forget Maggie
and move on.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.622
Like you did.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.148
Mike thinks
about his mom every day.

24:58.148 --> 25:01.674
He doesn't say it.

25:01.674 --> 25:04.415
But he feels as unwanted

25:04.415 --> 25:06.287
as Courtney does.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.118
One day, I'm gonna hate you

25:11.118 --> 25:13.555
as much as you hate your dad.

25:13.555 --> 25:17.080
I don't hate him, Mike.
I don't.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.693
And I never did.
- Good. Pat, that's good.

25:20.693 --> 25:24.044
Don't give in,
and we'll be out.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.331
You have to go to him.

25:50.331 --> 25:51.811
What if I hurt him again?

25:51.811 --> 25:54.770
Do you wanna hurt him?

25:54.770 --> 25:56.163
Then you won't.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.970
Please. You need to leave.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.581
I'm not going anywhere, Todd.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.199
We shouldn't have
trusted you.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.953
Where are we?

26:49.129 --> 26:50.957
Todd, I--

26:52.698 --> 26:54.395
I don't understand
any of this.

26:54.395 --> 26:57.267
I don't understand
it yet either.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.922
All I know
is we finally found each other.

27:01.576 --> 27:02.795
We need to go.

27:08.409 --> 27:09.715
- You go.
- Come on!

27:09.715 --> 27:12.674
You go, please.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.721
Dad left his ring for me.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.027
He knew we would find
each other with it.

27:22.902 --> 27:26.122
Somehow, he knew.

27:28.385 --> 27:29.909
We've always been connected.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.303
We always will be.

27:37.481 --> 27:38.787
We have to be.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.315
The light and the darkness.

27:57.937 --> 28:00.766
<i>- Todd!
- Jennie!</i>

28:00.766 --> 28:02.158
<i>No!</i>

28:03.377 --> 28:04.813
<i>Jennie!</i>

28:23.919 --> 28:25.442
- Come on!
- I told you,

28:25.442 --> 28:27.749
I could die going
back into that fire.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.056
Hey, you either die in here,
or you die trying.

28:30.056 --> 28:32.493
Pick one.

28:32.493 --> 28:35.017
Fair enough, Pat Dugan.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.484
Well,
I guess you were right.

29:52.225 --> 29:55.010
Where's the...

29:55.010 --> 29:57.578
skeleton guy?

29:57.578 --> 29:59.449
He's calming
some of our other patients.

29:59.449 --> 30:03.236
We don't often have nights
with this much excitement.

30:03.236 --> 30:06.239
I hope this won't become
a regular occurrence.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.719
I think we've got it
under control.

30:08.719 --> 30:12.158
You both still
have a home at Helix.

30:12.158 --> 30:15.378
What you're doing here
isn't right.

30:15.378 --> 30:17.293
All of our patients
are free to go

30:17.293 --> 30:18.947
any time they wish.

30:18.947 --> 30:21.907
No one is being held
against their will.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.996
That's actually true, Courtney.

30:25.693 --> 30:26.825
Oh.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.610
Even so.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.481
Spying on us
like you've been doing?

30:31.481 --> 30:32.961
Spying on you?

30:32.961 --> 30:35.834
They were behind the cameras?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.705
What are you talking about?

30:37.705 --> 30:40.316
The cameras you put up
all over Blue Valley.

30:40.316 --> 30:43.667
Inside our homes--
- We did no such thing.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.931
Then how do you know
so much about us?

30:45.931 --> 30:48.020
We do our research, yes.

30:48.020 --> 30:51.327
But spying on you
with hidden cameras?

30:51.327 --> 30:53.416
Don't be ridiculous.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.288
Yes, well.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.855
Then we're all done here?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.595
Or at least I am.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.905
I'm gonna go.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.081
Where?

31:06.081 --> 31:07.604
With my sister.

31:08.910 --> 31:12.305
I don't think that's wise,
Mr. Rice.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.309
But...

31:16.309 --> 31:17.658
best of luck.

31:23.403 --> 31:27.842
I trust we all keep
each other's secrets?

31:27.842 --> 31:30.236
You didn't happen
to teach fifth grade math

31:30.236 --> 31:34.457
back in the early 1980s
in Omaha, Nebraska, did you?

31:34.457 --> 31:37.417
I don't care
for your attitude, Mr. Dugan.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.288
I knew that was you.

31:56.175 --> 31:59.526
Courtney Whitmore might have
been right, Nurse Love.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.397
About what?

32:01.397 --> 32:06.141
Isolation might not be
the answer these kids need.

32:06.141 --> 32:10.711
Maybe Helix should form
a team of our own.

32:17.152 --> 32:19.111
You know,
I still can't believe

32:19.111 --> 32:20.851
that there's someone else
out there

32:20.851 --> 32:23.942
with the same powers as mine.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.292
Potentially even greater.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.555
- Envious?
- Oh.

32:28.555 --> 32:31.123
Sympathetic.

32:31.123 --> 32:34.996
You know,
when I first experienced them,

32:34.996 --> 32:36.302
they're frightening.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.915
So help him.

32:40.915 --> 32:42.525
I mean,
think about how much different

32:42.525 --> 32:44.310
your life would have been
had somebody helped you.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.312
Yes, well, who knows.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.619
You've lived like this
for over 100 years, Shade.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.360
If there's anything
on the planet

32:51.360 --> 32:53.145
that can help Todd
figure this out,

32:53.145 --> 32:54.494
it's not Helix.

32:56.452 --> 32:59.412
It's you.
- I-I'm no teacher, Pat.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.805
Yeah, I get that,
but you want redemption

33:01.805 --> 33:03.590
for the past, right?

33:03.590 --> 33:07.420
Well, it isn't just about
not doing bad things, Shade.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.248
It's about doing good.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.598
And you helped
to destroy the JSA.

33:11.598 --> 33:14.035
I did not kill--

33:14.035 --> 33:15.384
You were an accessory,

33:15.384 --> 33:16.646
whether you want
to face that or not.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.605
And those kids right there?

33:20.302 --> 33:22.087
They're the orphans
that were left behind.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.958
All right, that's enough, Stripesy.

33:28.832 --> 33:29.964
Ugh.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.013
My heart's dream.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.450
Saddled with reprobates.

33:39.669 --> 33:42.672
Ah, yes, hello. Um...

33:45.458 --> 33:48.852
Rather than make my exit,

33:48.852 --> 33:51.072
I'd like to extend...

33:51.072 --> 33:52.769
a hand.

33:55.207 --> 34:01.256
If you're amenable to my help
with the shadows?

34:01.256 --> 34:04.651
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.174
I'm not so sure.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.871
Well, then,
please turn me down.

34:07.871 --> 34:10.874
I do need to get to New York.
- New York?

34:10.874 --> 34:13.181
It's where Sandy Hawkins is.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.443
Wesley Dodd's nephew.

34:14.443 --> 34:17.838
Wesley Dodds, the Sandman?

34:17.838 --> 34:20.884
Look, I agreed to helping
two children, not three.

34:20.884 --> 34:23.539
Sandy has nightmares
of people in trouble

34:23.539 --> 34:25.628
like his uncle used to.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.761
That's how I knew
Todd was here.

34:27.761 --> 34:31.330
Sandy dreamt about me and Todd
and reached out to me.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.594
I promised him
I'd help with his nightmares

34:34.594 --> 34:36.074
once I found Todd.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.860
Ugh, New York. Fine.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.731
But things are gonna
be different from now on.

34:41.731 --> 34:46.084
None of your
outlandish theatrics.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.173
Right, follow me.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.526
Thanks, Courtney. Bye, Pat.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.228
- Pat?
- Yeah?

35:00.228 --> 35:01.838
How do we get home?

35:16.114 --> 35:19.769
I can't believe the Shade
actually agreed to help them.

35:19.769 --> 35:23.121
But, Pat,
that proves it's possible.

35:24.513 --> 35:26.341
People can reform.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.128
You know what else?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.478
I helped Jennie and Todd

35:32.478 --> 35:36.134
just like I helped
Yolanda and Rick and Beth

35:36.134 --> 35:38.832
without the staff.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.008
I know what I need to do
when I get back.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.228
Not give up

35:43.228 --> 35:46.840
on--on the villains,
on my friends.

35:48.102 --> 35:49.495
On myself.

35:54.108 --> 35:55.762
Pat?

35:55.762 --> 35:57.242
What do you think?

35:57.242 --> 35:59.853
Sounds good. All of it.

36:03.204 --> 36:06.425
I'm sorry, it's just, I, uh...

36:06.425 --> 36:08.731
can't shake it.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.777
I understand.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.562
When I went to the Shadowlands,
I saw and heard stuff

36:13.562 --> 36:16.652
that was really hard see too.

36:19.655 --> 36:23.659
If you wanna talk about them...

36:23.659 --> 36:24.834
Not yet.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.751
Whenever.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.623
Thanks.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.239
Pat.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.547
This has left us
with one question.

36:41.547 --> 36:45.507
If Helix hasn't been
the one spying on us...

36:45.507 --> 36:47.640
then who?

38:17.947 --> 38:19.384
Greg, move your head.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.994
Mad Ghost!
