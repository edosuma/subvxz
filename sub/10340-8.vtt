WEBVTT

02:23.768 --> 02:27.688
- Where do we look?
- I don't know. Everywhere.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.232
Where should we start?

02:38.032 --> 02:40.033
Maybe this is something.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.623
Umbrellas?

02:49.377 --> 02:53.547
The Kahala Hilton, July 1969,
men on the moon.

02:54.924 --> 03:00.971
August 9, 1974,
I first lay eyes on Mimsi.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.641
- Weird.
- Yeah. Heh.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.454
James.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.623
- What did you do?
- I just hit a button.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.583
Hit it again.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.840
There's gotta be a way to turn it off.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.514
My little coconut.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.809
James.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.024
Laura said something
on her tape about a coconut.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.819
Oh, my God. The necklace.

04:19.008 --> 04:23.845
Okay, Laura,
this is where you shot that video.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.557
Now just tell me,

04:27.725 --> 04:31.186
tell me why you sent me
to Sparkwood and 21?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.028
Oh, my God.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.982
No.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.475
- Red 36.
- Sorry, I guess our date's off.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.904
Sir, are you absolutely sure
you want another card?

06:04.322 --> 06:05.781
Yes, please.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.375
Twenty-one, can you beat that?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.797
Mother always said I was born lucky.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.395
Maybe later.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.980
Thanks for asking.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.155
This is for you.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.747
I'm a friend of Leo's.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.791
Who's Leo?

06:58.835 --> 07:00.585
Buy you a cocktail, Jacques?

07:17.770 --> 07:18.770
Come in.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.697
Turn around.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.203
Yes, very nice.

07:35.872 --> 07:36.872
Come over here.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.176
Something wrong?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.886
Uh-uh.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.513
This is a good night for you
to break in.

07:54.807 --> 07:55.974
The owner's coming by tonight,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.810
he likes to spend some time
with all the new girls.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.397
- Who's that?
- No names, child.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.442
You don't offer and you don't ask.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.068
Yes, ma'am.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.699
Pick a card.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.177
Jacques,
how long you been dealing blackjack?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.721
Long enough to spot a card counter.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.932
You always let
card counters buy you a drink?

08:37.099 --> 08:39.518
I don't see tips like that every day.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.937
Leo ever mentioned me to you?

08:43.147 --> 08:44.814
I don't know, mister. Who are you?

08:44.982 --> 08:47.901
I can't believe
Leo never told you about me.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.238
Maybe he did, I don't know.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.406
Leo played you like a violin.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.283
Had you and your brother
taking all the risk

08:55.451 --> 08:56.993
running the product
across the border.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.787
Never cut you in
on a piece of the action.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.455
I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.291
Take that chip out of your pocket
and a look at it.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.126
Go ahead.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.129
That chip has a special significance.

09:08.297 --> 09:11.424
A very special night
you spent up at your cabin.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.592
Here's a clue:

09:13.761 --> 09:16.221
"Laura, Laura."

09:16.806 --> 09:19.558
Take it easy. Take it easy.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.476
How do you think
a low-rent hump like Leo's

09:21.644 --> 09:23.478
been financing this little operation?

09:25.106 --> 09:28.775
- You.
- I'm the bank.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.529
- He never mentioned your name.
- Course not.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.905
Leo makes the buy with my cash.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.949
You and your brother mule it
across the border.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.201
He ever tell you
who was distributing stateside?

09:38.369 --> 09:40.161
No. Some high school kid,
that's all I know.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.329
That's right.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.999
We're in sync now, Jacques.
Can you feel it?

09:44.542 --> 09:47.794
- Can you?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

09:47.962 --> 09:52.382
Good, because I've got a job for you
across the border tonight.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.844
No Leo. No middleman.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.014
It's ten grand.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.433
Half now, half on completion.

10:01.851 --> 10:02.934
How's that sound?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.105
Sounds good.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.524
What are we doing?

10:10.192 --> 10:13.153
You meet me at the water-processing
plant on Black Lake in two hours.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.447
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- No.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.699
- No problem.
- Good.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.373
One more question, Jacques.

10:26.042 --> 10:30.003
You know, Leo told me all about
that night at the cabin with the girls.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.174
I'm curious about the chip,
how'd that happen?

10:36.385 --> 10:38.219
It was that crazy bird.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.973
- Bird?
- It had a thing for Laura.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.561
Saying her name all the time.
Like he's in love or something.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.063
So we're all partying.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.399
Girls are all getting pretty high,
everybody's pretty crazy.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.734
You, Laura and Ronette.

10:53.110 --> 10:57.489
Leo lets Waldo out of the cage
and the bird, he lands on her shoulder.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.492
Laura, she's all tied up.

11:01.035 --> 11:05.288
She liked that, the bird,
he starts pecking on her shoulder,

11:05.456 --> 11:08.416
pecking like love pecks or something,
you know what I mean?

11:08.584 --> 11:09.584
So Leo,

11:10.336 --> 11:11.586
he's doing a number on her

11:12.046 --> 11:15.256
and Laura,
she's screaming about that damn bird.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.593
So Leo takes out a chip.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.097
Puts it in her mouth and says:

11:23.265 --> 11:28.269
"Bite the bullet, baby. Bite the bullet."

11:32.983 --> 11:34.693
Thanks for clearing that up.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.612
Yeah, no problem.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.781
See you on the other side.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.449
Can do, Cappy.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.127
Got a trout on the line, Hawk.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.171
This one's a keeper.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.011
I'm just gonna sit right here, okay?

12:02.179 --> 12:04.347
Come here, sweetie.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.975
Look, we got all night, baby.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.147
Ow.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.784
You made me do this, Shelly.
You made me.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.712
Is Lucy talking to you yet?

13:18.214 --> 13:20.381
As we say
in the law enforcement game,

13:20.549 --> 13:22.926
it's a cold trail.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.846
Agh. Women.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.600
Harry, Hawk here.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.895
The trout's heading upstream
towards the net.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.649
Hawk, hold the line.
We'll set the hook.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.400
You got a twenty on Agent Cooper?

13:39.568 --> 13:41.277
He's downstream
about ten minutes.

13:41.445 --> 13:45.573
He'll probably miss the catch,
but he'll be there when we grill him.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.825
Copy that.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.912
We'll make our move as soon
as the big fish shows his fins.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.500
- Ready, Andy?
- Ready, Harry.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.849
Jacques, keep your hands
where I can see them.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.725
Put them on the roof of the car, now.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.352
You heard him.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.189
Get in there and cuff him.
Don't move.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.149
You're under arrest.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.944
For the attempted murder
of Ronette Pulaski

14:23.529 --> 14:25.947
and the murder of Laura Palmer.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.283
Give me your other hand.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.662
- He's got my gun.
- Harry, look out.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.959
- My shoulder.
- Andy.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.628
- Call an ambulance?
- Are you okay, Harry?

14:40.796 --> 14:42.547
- Yeah.
- Shut up, you're all right.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.965
Better call that ambulance.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.426
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Yeah.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.512
Anything you say can and will
be held against you in a court of law.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.055
You have a right to an attorney.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.811
Hello.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.106
All clear.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.275
Be there as soon as I can.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.491
Hey, what's up, doc?

15:10.659 --> 15:13.286
It's Laura,
in case you haven't guessed.

15:13.454 --> 15:18.207
It's Thursday the 23rd
and I'm so bored.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.836
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.341
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

15:26.508 --> 15:31.012
And right now,
I can only take so much of sweet.

15:32.890 --> 15:38.227
Hey, remember that mystery man
I told you about?

15:38.646 --> 15:44.025
Well, if I tell you his name,
then you're gonna be in trouble.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.028
He wouldn't be such a mystery man
anymore,

15:47.196 --> 15:50.198
but you might be history, man.

15:51.033 --> 15:55.203
I think a couple of times
he's tried to kill me.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.538
But guess what?

15:57.706 --> 16:02.043
As you know, I sure got off on it.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.881
Isn't sex weird?

16:08.133 --> 16:13.721
This guy can really light my F-l-R-E.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.599
As in red Corvette.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.103
Uh-oh.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.314
Here comes Mom
with milk and cookies.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.482
Donna.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.150
- Later, Lawrence.
- Dad?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.778
Bye-bye.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.073
I've got an emergency at the hospital,
I don't know when I'll be back.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.908
See if your mother
needs anything, huh?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.910
- Okay. All right, Dad.
- I'll call later.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.832
James.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.377
It's okay, I'm glad I heard her say it.
I'm glad.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.879
I might have gone my whole life...

16:48.257 --> 16:51.426
- I'm sorry you had to hear that.
- I'm okay.

16:51.885 --> 16:55.013
Jacoby didn't kill her.
He was trying to help her.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.016
Then how'd he get the necklace?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.569
You hear that?

17:55.032 --> 17:58.409
You've got about one hour
to think about what you've done to me.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.287
And think about it.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.333
Because by then
Bobby Briggs is gonna be dead.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.924
You broke my heart.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.195
Goodbye.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.246
It's all here.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.915
Pretty generous, Josie.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.794
Sitting in that concrete box
all that time,

19:31.962 --> 19:35.047
90 grand seemed like
all the money in creation.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.134
Kept me going.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.680
It's a funny thing.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.642
Back in the world, I don't know,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.604
seems kind of light.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.233
We had an agreement.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.990
I've been going over this
in my mind and...

20:01.450 --> 20:04.160
See, if you could follow my thinking,

20:04.328 --> 20:06.412
we're all born into life,

20:06.580 --> 20:08.080
and we have
a certain number of years

20:08.248 --> 20:11.209
to move and breathe
and have our being.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.587
That's from a book
on Oriental philosophy

20:14.755 --> 20:16.964
I read when I was in the joint.

20:17.549 --> 20:22.470
And maybe somebody somewhere
knows how much time we have.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.597
I don't, do you?

20:26.642 --> 20:30.436
So when a man gives up
a certain portion of his life...

20:30.604 --> 20:31.896
Eighteen months, for instance.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.274
- how does he place a value
on that time?

20:35.651 --> 20:40.446
Eighteen months, 90,000,
what's that?

20:40.614 --> 20:42.406
Five thousand a month?

20:42.574 --> 20:45.159
Well, that's not bad, if you're gonna
live another 40 or 50 years.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.411
But what if you only got another 20?

20:47.579 --> 20:49.163
Or ten?

20:49.665 --> 20:53.334
Or some unforeseen event
killed you tomorrow?

20:53.502 --> 20:56.254
As in the case
of the boating accident

20:56.421 --> 20:59.090
that killed your late husband,
Andrew.

21:03.011 --> 21:06.055
Or say you just got out of prison,

21:06.223 --> 21:08.766
where you went in for, uh,

21:08.934 --> 21:13.521
vehicular manslaughter
as part of an agreement

21:13.689 --> 21:17.191
to avoid being implicated in the
commission of a much greater crime.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.859
Murder.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.946
For which in fact
you were responsible.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.031
But now there's this threat,

21:24.199 --> 21:29.453
this possible threat
that this fact could be discovered.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.707
And in one stroke ten
or 15 or 20 more years of your life

21:32.874 --> 21:35.376
could be cut right off
from underneath you.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.504
So I've been asking myself:

21:38.672 --> 21:44.051
"What does that do
to the market value of 18 months?"

21:46.638 --> 21:48.723
We had an agreement.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.019
And we still do, sweetheart.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.855
Signed, sealed, delivered.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.525
And I'm gonna take care
of everything we agreed to.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.902
See, you want a lot for your money.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.406
And I want a lot for my time.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.869
You know,
there's a saying in the joint.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.747
It's not Oriental philosophy,

22:12.914 --> 22:19.587
but it has a similar kind of logic that
appeals to my, uh, spiritual nature.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.756
Once you're in business
with somebody,

22:21.923 --> 22:24.050
you're in business for life.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.427
Like a marriage.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.404
Partner.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.141
Damn.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.937
Where is it? Where is it?

23:18.563 --> 23:19.605
Catherine?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.650
The account ledger,
have you seen it?

23:23.568 --> 23:26.654
Well, don't you keep it
in that little safe at home?

23:26.822 --> 23:29.615
No, it's not in the safe at home,
it's not here, it's not anywhere.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.826
Tell me you didn't take it.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.244
I didn't take it.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.206
Pete, tell me the truth.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.000
You're not helping her
to pull something here.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.002
- Who?
- Josie.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.922
Well, no.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.717
Pull what here?

23:48.885 --> 23:53.472
Oh, Peter, forget everything that we've
ever said or done to hurt each other.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.516
Just like that?

23:55.684 --> 23:57.768
Temporarily.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.687
I know our marriage
is a living train wreck.

23:59.855 --> 24:04.275
But there used to be something
caring between us.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.777
The fellow who caught my eye.

24:07.487 --> 24:11.699
The lumberjack who could
scamper up a tree like a cat.

24:12.701 --> 24:16.704
The boss' sister
from that big house on the hill.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.500
A summer's indiscretion
and here we are.

24:21.668 --> 24:22.668
Catherine.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.256
Oh, Pete.

24:28.216 --> 24:31.802
I never should have taken you
to that house up on the hill.

24:31.970 --> 24:36.390
Well, I have no complaints
about the house.

24:37.309 --> 24:43.189
As for me, taking my principle pleasure
in lashing out at the one person

24:43.356 --> 24:44.773
who was decent enough
to stand by me

24:44.941 --> 24:46.317
through all my foolishness.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.570
I know things haven't
been easy for you.

24:52.741 --> 24:58.913
Peter, if somewhere
under all that scar tissue

24:59.080 --> 25:01.957
there's the faintest flicker
of what we used to feel for each other,

25:02.125 --> 25:04.585
I'm asking you to feel that now.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.087
Why?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.798
Exactly.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.010
Because I'm in trouble.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.263
And given what I've become
and the way I've treated people,

25:16.431 --> 25:18.599
there's no one else I can turn to.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.643
I need your help.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.817
Catherine. Catherine.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.955
So Fred starts
to put the cuffs on him, right.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.123
Now Harry, he turns to go.

25:43.291 --> 25:46.460
Now all of a sudden, Jacques throws
an elbow at Fred like this: Wham!

25:46.628 --> 25:49.672
And in one move, takes Fred's gun

25:49.839 --> 25:51.465
and he's got the drop on Harry.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.677
Harry is deader
than a pound of roadside stew.

25:54.844 --> 25:59.682
Then all of a sudden,
a single shot rings out.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.894
All right.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.605
- Andy, my man.
- All right, Andy.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.655
Go ahead, Andy, give it your best shot.
Go on.

26:56.406 --> 27:00.117
- Oh, Andy.
- Oh, Punky.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.037
I'm pregnant.

27:21.222 --> 27:22.973
Uh-oh.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.062
Fresh coffee.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.785
- What?
- Let me talk to the sheriff.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.745
I'm sorry,
the sheriff isn't in at the moment.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.831
I expect him back shortly,
would you care to leave a message?

27:48.750 --> 27:53.253
You tell him Leo Johnson
said to check out James Hurley.

27:53.421 --> 27:57.091
- He's an easy rider.
- An easy rider?

27:57.258 --> 28:00.094
- You got that?
- Yes, I've got that, but Leo?

28:00.261 --> 28:02.137
Wait, Leo?

28:05.433 --> 28:07.559
Dr. John Vincent, ICU,

28:07.727 --> 28:09.520
Dr. John Vincent, ICU.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.857
Did you take Laura and
Ronette up to your cabin that night?

28:14.025 --> 28:17.945
You know they'd both been up there
before, they was no nuns.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.948
Is that where you took the pictures
for Flesh World?

28:21.116 --> 28:22.950
Yeah, that was Laura's idea.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.953
She talked Ronette into,
uh, making them ads.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.580
What did you and Leo fight about
that night?

28:30.083 --> 28:32.459
Bastard, he hit me
with a whiskey bottle.

28:32.627 --> 28:33.627
Why?

28:33.795 --> 28:36.213
I don't know why.
That's why we fought. Heh.

28:36.381 --> 28:40.509
I'm bleeding like a stuck pig,
and he's laughing.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.262
So you used Leo's shirt
to stop the bleeding. What then?

28:43.430 --> 28:45.431
I got sick.

28:45.598 --> 28:48.976
I go outside, pass out.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.311
I wake up, I'm lying on the ground.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.313
Where was Leo?

28:53.648 --> 28:56.859
Leo and the girls,
they were gone. Ha, ha.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.694
What about the train car?

28:58.862 --> 29:01.155
I don't know nothing about that.

29:01.322 --> 29:04.950
I come down the hill,
Leo's car's gone.

29:06.161 --> 29:10.456
Had to walk 15 miles
back to my own house. Heh.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.172
When they brought him in,
he was rambling incoherently.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.341
These things he said to you,
they're pretty incredible.

29:21.509 --> 29:24.511
I know, let's hope he pulls through.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.014
Well, he's stabilized anyway.

29:27.432 --> 29:31.643
So Leo had to take the girls
to the train car by himself.

29:31.853 --> 29:35.105
- You believe him?
- He's too stupid to lie.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.691
He'll testify against Leo. We got him.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.027
We've gotta find Leo first.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.572
- Doc, how's Jacoby?
- He's out of the woods.

29:43.740 --> 29:48.368
Listen, he, uh... He says he got
a phone call from Laura Palmer.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.370
He was on his way to see her
when he was jumped.

29:50.538 --> 29:51.914
That brought on the heart attack.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.209
- Any description of the assailant?
- He didn't see him.

29:55.376 --> 30:00.005
But he says he saw Laura Palmer
standing by the gazebo in Easter Park.

30:04.385 --> 30:10.808
It's not here. It's not here.
It's not here either. Damn.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.102
Ahh.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.356
Midge.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.400
Midge Jones.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.653
What are you doing?

30:24.197 --> 30:27.574
It's, uh, my old high school yearbook.

30:28.618 --> 30:31.078
I thought it was gone forever.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.579
Oh, Pete.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.207
Sorry.

30:42.423 --> 30:43.924
What?

30:44.092 --> 30:47.261
- It's at the mill.
- What is?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.721
What you're looking for.

30:49.889 --> 30:52.015
Drying shed 3, near the north gate.

30:53.476 --> 30:54.852
Pete.

30:59.065 --> 31:02.025
Guess I'll look in the other room.

31:05.446 --> 31:08.240
What do you want? Talk terms.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.201
We'll let you know.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.807
Hey, Norma, do you still have
that big down comforter on your bed?

31:33.975 --> 31:35.559
Yes, Hank.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.854
Mattresses they give you
on your bunk,

31:39.022 --> 31:43.483
they're probably yay thick, you know.

31:43.818 --> 31:47.446
And you lie there at night thinking,

31:47.614 --> 31:51.074
"If this mattress's so skinny,
how'd they get all those rocks inside?"

31:52.911 --> 31:55.537
So, uh, you'll forgive me if I tell you

31:55.705 --> 31:58.290
that, uh, night after night,

31:58.458 --> 32:03.295
I dreamed of you lying there
on that big feather bed.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.928
I guess the, uh,

32:11.095 --> 32:14.806
hired help shouldn't be so familiar
with the boss lady, huh?

32:14.974 --> 32:16.767
I can't blame you for dreaming.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.355
I wasn't just dreaming
about being with you, Norma.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.523
What I was trying to...

32:24.859 --> 32:27.819
I shouldn't even be saying
this much, heck.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.363
I think you should.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.282
No, I haven't earned the right,
Norma.

32:32.450 --> 32:36.036
- I've been back what, two days?
- Say what you wanna say.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.919
I've been trying to picture
a whole life with you.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.462
With the diner.

32:45.630 --> 32:49.007
Making it soar. Making it blue sky.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.722
I always talk too big.
That's my biggest fault.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.558
I learned that talking
to my counselor inside.

32:58.726 --> 33:01.186
This is new territory for me.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.564
But I'm gonna try Norma.

33:05.733 --> 33:09.027
You know, it's 20 years
we've been together next month.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.237
Can you believe it?

33:11.406 --> 33:13.281
Maybe we're doing this
all backwards.

33:13.449 --> 33:16.576
Maybe it's the next 20 that counts.

33:18.413 --> 33:22.582
Give me time, Norma,
I'll make you proud of me yet.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.021
Nadine?

33:50.528 --> 33:51.903
Nadine?

33:53.239 --> 33:54.865
Honey?

33:59.579 --> 34:02.748
Oh, God, Nadine. Don't you do this.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.708
Nadine.

34:09.589 --> 34:13.383
I need an ambulance.
My wife has just taken some pills.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.469
422 Riverside.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.637
For the love of God, hurry.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.099
Stay with me, Nadine.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.272
Please don't go.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.985
Stay with me.

34:39.118 --> 34:40.619
Leo Johnson's gone underground.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.662
My bet is he's holed up
somewhere near his home.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.874
Sheriff, Leo Johnson called.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.292
- When?
- About ten minutes ago.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.044
He left this message.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.464
And sheriff, in the background,
when I spoke to him,

34:52.632 --> 34:54.800
I could hear a clock striking.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.343
What kind of clock, Lucy?

34:56.511 --> 34:59.096
It sounded like
the clock at Easter Park.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.473
- Harry.
- Hawk.

35:01.641 --> 35:02.682
Good work, Lucy.

35:02.850 --> 35:04.684
Hawk, pull the surveillance
off Leo's house,

35:04.852 --> 35:06.853
I want you to set up a perimeter
around Easter Park.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.021
Got it.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.107
I'll radio.
You get some cars over there.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.567
- Harry, I gotta talk to you.
- Sure.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.694
Harry, let me talk to James.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.988
You wanna investigate this?

35:17.865 --> 35:19.366
Come on, James.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.578
Harry.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.790
Harry, is it true?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.792
You've found him.
You've got the killer?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.919
We've arrested a suspect, Leland,
that's all.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.838
But is it the man, Harry? Is it him?

35:33.005 --> 35:35.257
We can't release
any details right now.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.384
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.886
Leland,
there's nothing you can do here.

35:40.054 --> 35:42.681
You should be home
with Sarah now.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.725
Well, yes, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

35:45.893 --> 35:49.604
- You going back to the hospital?
- No. I'm heading home.

35:49.772 --> 35:53.400
- Thank you, Will.
- Don't give it a thought.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.411
Hospital.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.290
Think you ought to listen to this tape.

36:08.457 --> 36:09.875
Why is that?

36:10.084 --> 36:12.502
It was Laura's. We found it.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.422
I think it'll help you find
who you're looking for.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.591
Who might that be?

36:18.426 --> 36:20.594
Somebody with a red Corvette.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.764
Dr. Jacoby's in the hospital
with a heart attack.

36:25.433 --> 36:28.602
- Heart attack?
- He said he saw Laura Palmer tonight.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.272
James, what kind of dangerous game
have you been playing?

36:34.567 --> 36:35.942
Is Jacoby gonna be all right?

36:43.201 --> 36:46.119
I've been very patient with you,
James.

36:47.038 --> 36:51.917
From here on out, I'm gonna need
a better set of answers.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.925
Let's start with why this was
in the gas tank of your bike.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.645
Fine, fine, fine.

37:11.812 --> 37:14.356
- Okay, okay.
- Uh-huh.

37:14.523 --> 37:18.485
- Ghostwood. Fantastic. I love it.
- Mm! Ha-ha-ha.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.154
All your revisions are included.

37:21.322 --> 37:25.033
Ben, I am so happy
I can't even say how much.

37:28.663 --> 37:33.041
- After you.
- No, no, no, after you.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.919
- After me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.298
Excuse me.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.260
Benjamin Horne here.

37:43.719 --> 37:46.096
Time to Black Flag that little firebug.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.015
Leo Johnson's
gonna get a house call.

37:49.183 --> 37:50.809
Proceed.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.533
Shelly?

38:09.161 --> 38:11.162
Shelly, are you here?

38:14.041 --> 38:15.709
Shelly's not here, Bobby.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.044
Leo, man, am I glad to see you.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.046
Was there something
I could help you with?

38:20.256 --> 38:23.717
Actually, it's you I was looking for,
the cops, man, they're after you.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.385
Liar.

38:28.514 --> 38:31.725
- Shelly's dead. You killed her.
- Aah! Unh!

38:34.437 --> 38:35.770
No, Leo.

38:54.081 --> 38:56.082
Later, Leo.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.999
I can't understand
a word you're saying,

39:38.167 --> 39:40.293
you have a thing in your mouth.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.933
- Who are you?
- Shelly Johnson.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.143
You know who called me here?

39:57.353 --> 39:59.979
No, I don't know anything,
please help me...

40:00.147 --> 40:02.982
Be quiet, I'm thinking.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.153
Oh, God.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.824
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.090
Oh, God.

41:53.969 --> 41:57.263
- Any of the boys still inside?
- Not sure. Shift was over.

41:57.431 --> 41:59.849
But we're still trying to get a count.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.185
- Seen Catherine?
- No, Pete.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.937
That's her car.

42:04.104 --> 42:07.982
Jesus God,
you think she's still inside?

42:08.526 --> 42:11.486
I guess I'm gonna have to find out.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.282
Pete, that ain't such a good idea.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.498
She's still my wife.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.678
Catherine.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.139
And that is that.

42:42.434 --> 42:45.937
- Ben, is this a great moment?
- Ghostwood.

42:46.105 --> 42:49.315
Incredible. Ghostwood. Huh?

42:52.903 --> 42:56.781
Einar, tonight,
you play on the house.

42:58.617 --> 43:01.452
This is marvelous, eh?

43:01.620 --> 43:05.206
Enjoy, my friend. Enjoy.

43:06.625 --> 43:07.792
To Ghostwood.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.879
To Ghostwood Estates
and Country Club.

43:16.719 --> 43:19.887
Congratulations, boss.

43:22.933 --> 43:25.059
Blackie, old pal,

43:26.020 --> 43:28.479
this calls for a celebration.

43:28.647 --> 43:32.900
Let's have a look at the new girl.

43:42.953 --> 43:45.121
Good luck, honey.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.542
Close your eyes.

43:50.294 --> 43:55.423
This is such stuff
as dreams are made of.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.098
Diane.

44:04.266 --> 44:06.517
4:37 a.m.

44:06.852 --> 44:08.353
After a long investigative night,

44:08.520 --> 44:10.480
returning to my room
at The Great Northern.

44:10.648 --> 44:11.981
We have one suspect in custody

44:12.149 --> 44:15.276
and Leo Johnson, the man I believe
is responsible for Laura's death,

44:15.444 --> 44:19.572
won't be able to escape the dragnet
we've thrown up for him much longer.

44:22.159 --> 44:25.745
As you can hear
from the ambient sound around me,

44:25.913 --> 44:28.373
and I notice with some relief
that the Icelandic group

44:28.540 --> 44:33.586
staying on my floor
have either checked or passed out.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.256
I may not need
the Ear-Pillow Earplugs,

44:37.424 --> 44:39.092
which I did receive today, Diane,

44:39.259 --> 44:40.802
although I suspect
I may put them to use

44:40.969 --> 44:43.846
as a purely precautionary measure.

44:44.014 --> 44:45.932
I ordered some hot milk
from room service.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.183
Hoping that does the job

44:47.351 --> 44:50.853
and I'll be able to catch a few hours
of quality sack time.

44:51.814 --> 44:52.980
Twenty-four hour room service

44:53.148 --> 44:56.943
must be one of the premier
achievements of modern civilization.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.913
"My special agent."

45:21.844 --> 45:23.511
Cooper here.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.181
Who is this?

45:29.768 --> 45:31.394
Couldn't this wait
until tomorrow morning?

45:32.771 --> 45:35.314
Please excuse me,
I've got room service.

45:39.153 --> 45:40.945
Agent Cooper,
we found Leo Johnson.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.489
He's been shot. Agent Cooper?
