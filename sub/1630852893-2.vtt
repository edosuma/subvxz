WEBVTT

00:38.246 --> 00:40.206
We would like
to thank you for coming here

00:40.290 --> 00:43.126
all the way from Washington D.C.
to meet with us.

00:43.209 --> 00:48.089
And if there's anything we can get for you
before we begin, some coffee or a--

00:48.173 --> 00:50.925
General Naird, with a new administration
comes a new budget,

00:51.009 --> 00:53.803
and your budget
has been drastically slashed.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.514
So no coffee or…

00:56.598 --> 00:57.474
Cruller?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.185
No. All right.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.854
We understand that
we are entering a period of austerity.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.273
How slashed are we talking about?

01:05.356 --> 01:06.566
Almost half.

01:06.649 --> 01:07.692
Unacceptable.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.945
-Oh, God.
-Science can't be nickeled and dimed.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.907
All right. You know what? We can
tighten our belts a little bit. Sure.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.617
When I was behind enemy lines,

01:15.700 --> 01:19.662
I learned how to make a daily ration
last for three weeks.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.416
The secret is that
you have to swallow a lot of air.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.627
Trick your stomach
into thinking that it's full.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.797
It is not good physically.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.800
It inflates your… your intestine
like a balloon, and that--

01:31.883 --> 01:34.135
I'll need your red-line reductions
by midday.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.428
Okay. Midday.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.264
And if you can't do it,
it'll be done for you.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.599
Some manners would be nice.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.351
Excuse me?

01:41.434 --> 01:42.477
What?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.939
Thank you very much, Miss, uh…

01:46.022 --> 01:47.524
-Hmm.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.858
Wow, what a pill.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.694
They better not cancel my Mars mission.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.697
Dr. Chan and I
personally birthed that project.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.407
I'm… It's not gonna… It's fine.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.662
Not to mention there is
an astronaut up there halfway to Mars.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.996
What do I tell him?

02:02.080 --> 02:05.834
"Hey, Captain Lancaster,
you know the bone mass you lost

02:05.917 --> 02:09.129
traveling through space alone
for nine months?"

02:09.212 --> 02:12.215
"Well, it was all for nothing.
Enjoy your osteoporosis."

02:12.298 --> 02:13.842
I know, I know, I know, Adrian.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.511
We just need to be specific
and surgical about our cuts, that's all.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.306
That woman just took
my prescription office chair.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.519
Who gives a lab rat's ass
about your office chair, Brad?

02:24.602 --> 02:27.230
Well, it was specifically designed
to support my testis.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.941
You can use a regular office chair
for your testis, Brad.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.067
You're not a Fabergé egg.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.862
Look, we just have
to find ways to pinch pennies.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.947
Okay. Well, here's a perfect example.

02:36.030 --> 02:39.576
3D printers for on-site rover repair.
That can be cut.

02:39.659 --> 02:43.788
Sure, let's cut those, because it's not
like we're doing rocket science here.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.625
Right? Oh, wait, it is. Or it was.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.127
I don't know if this helps or not,

02:49.210 --> 02:51.921
but my aunt pees in the dark
to save on her light bill.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.047
Doesn't help.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.886
You bought a stock?
Do you even know anything about stocks?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.095
<i>Not a thing.</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:02.473
<i>My boyfriend told me about it,</i>
<i>and I made almost two grand in one day.</i>

03:02.557 --> 03:04.392
<i>And I didn't have to do anything.</i>

03:04.475 --> 03:05.310
Really?

03:05.393 --> 03:07.645
That sounds a little too good to be true.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.522
But then again,

03:09.606 --> 03:12.775
being paid to do nothing
is actually my dream job.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.486
<i>My boyfriend says</i>
<i>you have to buy in now while it's cheap.</i>

03:15.570 --> 03:17.113
How much do I have to invest?

03:17.197 --> 03:20.450
<i>Just depends on how rich you wanna get.</i>
<i>Takes money to make money.</i>

03:20.533 --> 03:22.452
I could use my college fund.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.953
<i>Oh, that's a great idea.</i>

03:25.455 --> 03:26.414
Is it?

03:29.792 --> 03:34.130
Okay. I think the data supports
a wide range of interpretations.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.507
If we look back at quadrant one here,
when you see the--

03:36.591 --> 03:39.969
Stocks. What do we think?
Like, they're good for you, right?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.095
Uh, what?

03:42.055 --> 03:44.849
Oh. Oh, sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

03:44.933 --> 03:45.892
Well…

03:45.975 --> 03:47.060
Rocket stuff?

03:47.143 --> 03:50.104
No. We're trying to figure out
if Angela's into me or not.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.607
Yeah, you know what?
I definitely don't like these numbers.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.360
Your ratio of text to response
is five to one.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.528
Yeah, maybe it's the emojis you're using.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.240
Well, see, I don't use emojis.
I use emoticons.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.574
See how cute this one is?

04:01.658 --> 04:04.661
Uh, well, no one uses emoticons anymore.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.828
Really?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.080
Mm-mm.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.414
Why didn't anyone tell me?

04:08.498 --> 04:12.293
All these brainiacs, and nobody told me
nobody uses emoticons anymore?

04:12.377 --> 04:13.795
I look like an idiot out here.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.049
-Wait. So you and Angela are like dating?
-That's what we're trying to figure out.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.552
Let me walk everyone
through the timeline one more time. Okay?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.514
So, Angela returns from the moon,

04:24.597 --> 04:27.934
we kiss, and we spend the night
in the hotel room.

04:28.017 --> 04:31.646
And, you know, we fool around,
things are going great, and then boom.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.816
For some mysterious reason, she ghosts me.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.026
Which hotel?

04:37.735 --> 04:38.653
Mm-hmm.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.281
Courtyard by Marriott.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.616
-I'm a Bonvoy Rewards member.
-Mmm.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.868
What? Does she think I'm cheap?

04:47.161 --> 04:49.622
I upgraded the room with points.
I got the Garden View.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.874
I mean, it's a junior executive suite.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.793
I couldn't get
the Executive executive suite.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.045
That's just too much money.
I can't afford that.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.839
And then we got
the continental breakfast--

04:57.922 --> 05:00.925
D-D-Dude. You're spinning like OJ 287.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.138
Jeez. It's a quasar. It's the fastest
rotating object in the universe.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.347
That's so cool.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.598
Yeah. Oh.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.603
-Yep.
-Oh.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.646
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.564
Uh-huh.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.274
You're overthinking it.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.861
Focus up. Focus up, please.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.070
Eyes over here.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.324
What I have in my hands right now,
press schedule, all right?

05:24.407 --> 05:27.452
Now, as you know, Space Force
is very much under the microscope.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.996
The press has
a love-hate relationship with us.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.248
"What does that mean, Tony?"
Let me explain it to you.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.751
They love to hate us,
and they hate to love us.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.961
So we all have to be
on the same exact page

05:37.045 --> 05:40.089
about how we're gonna answer questions
about what happened on the moon.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.591
Right. Like, "Hey, Space Force,

05:41.674 --> 05:43.968
did y'all almost start
a moon war with China?"

05:44.052 --> 05:47.096
Exactly. But… But did we though?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.348
-Yeah.
-Yes.

05:48.431 --> 05:53.561
Or… was there
"a brief communication breakdown,

05:53.644 --> 05:55.980
but with diplomacy and cooperation,

05:56.064 --> 05:59.317
both nations worked together
to return home to Earth"?

05:59.400 --> 06:00.401
Womp-womp!

06:00.485 --> 06:04.530
That, my friend in the biz,
is what we call a spin.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.492
So do we tell the press
what happened to my bird?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.701
Absolutely not.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.745
That bird <i>is </i>the bird from the moon.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.331
Eddie never killed or ate
any living thing.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.291
I don't regret it. I'd do it again.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.210
What's going on
with that bird after the show?

06:17.293 --> 06:20.546
You're not gonna eat that bird
because that bird is Pella's precious pet.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.799
I have no connection to this bird.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.051
Our relationship is a lie.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.845
You got 30 minutes to make it true.
Is that enough time?

06:28.930 --> 06:29.764
No.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.975
Okay. Remember our mantra, everybody.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.936
Whatever happened on the moon…

06:36.646 --> 06:37.814
stays on the moon.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.525
Wow! Whatever happens on the moon…

06:40.608 --> 06:41.943
…stays on the moon.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.611
Great. This is what's gonna happen now.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.280
We're gonna go through some
practice questions. I'll play the press.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.532
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.866
One person. Are you ready?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.576
-Yes, let's do it.
-I'm so ready.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.994
You, sir, in the back.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.081
Oh, me? Thank you for calling on me.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.542
Ron Stimply, <i>National Geographic</i>.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.002
Quick quest for all you
guardians out there.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.046
Uh, do you know any fun facts
about the moon?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.924
Uh, yes. Hello. I do, uh, Ron Stimply.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.509
Yes, that's me. I'm Ron Stimply.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.262
The moon always
shows the Earth the same face.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.807
Oh my! Very fun.
I love how into it you are.

07:12.890 --> 07:17.145
Now is the time where I will ask
other people that same question. You, sir.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.273
Well, it's flat, Ron.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.900
No, of course it's not. It is round.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.861
So is a pizza.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.363
But it is also flat.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.449
Just trust me. I've eaten one.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.326
I'm glad someone finally said
what we're all thinking.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.369
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.288
Okay, there's been
a change of plans. Listen up.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.708
Only Angela and the bird
are going to be meeting the press.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.209
-Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no.
-No!

07:40.293 --> 07:42.336
-Don't know that I can be alone.
-Gotta push my cameo.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.422
General Naird believes,
and I believe as well,

07:44.505 --> 07:47.258
Angela Ali,
that is the future of Space Force.

07:47.341 --> 07:51.929
She is the next "shero"
in our great American "herstory."

07:52.013 --> 07:53.598
I don't think this is such a good idea.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.642
Remember, I was the one who said,
"It's good to be Black on the moon."

07:56.726 --> 07:57.852
-Remember that?
-Yeah.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.021
And America ate it up
like a meth-sprinkled,

08:00.104 --> 08:02.315
deep-fried Snickers bar
you get at a state fair.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.108
Angela, you're a queen.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.902
You're America's queen.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.320
Wear your crown.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.907
I spent $600 on a makeover.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.326
And you look beautiful.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.619
Move that right out.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.539
Please put that printer in my car.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.667
-What else are they taking next?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.461
This is bullshit.

08:24.128 --> 08:27.840
Ah, NASA. You say NASA?
Ah, of course, NASA.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.926
Nerds of Average Science Ability.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.803
<i> Yeah, well, Adrian,</i>
<i>a little birdie told me</i>

08:32.887 --> 08:34.639
<i>that your budget has been cut in half.</i>

08:34.722 --> 08:35.848
Fuck you.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.225
<i> Fuck you.</i>

08:37.308 --> 08:38.518
Fuck you!

08:38.601 --> 08:39.477
<i>-Fuck y--</i>

08:39.560 --> 08:40.394
Anyway…

08:40.478 --> 08:44.190
Well, this room is a big energy suck.

08:44.273 --> 08:48.152
Well, what do you expect? I had to let go
a third of my science team this morning.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.197
Good news. Anybody hungry?
Because I sprung for lunch.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.823
Hope you brought your "McAppetites."

08:52.907 --> 08:55.243
What about lunches
from the executive dining room?

08:55.326 --> 08:58.162
The executive dining room's gone,
so we're gonna brown-bag it.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.916
But I ordered blackened Cajun salmon
with cranberry vinaigrette.

09:01.999 --> 09:05.127
Look, everybody, I know that it's tough.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.673
I know that you are all sacrificing, but…

09:10.049 --> 09:11.551
let me tell you a little story.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.678
-My parents were having a tough year.

09:13.761 --> 09:17.807
And I knew there were going to be
no presents under the tree that Christmas.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.518
So, Christmas morning, what did my dad do?

09:20.601 --> 09:23.396
My dad got down,

09:23.938 --> 09:26.566
and he crawled under the tree.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.863
And then my mom crawled under the tree.
And then I crawled under the tree.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.950
And the three of us lay there,
under the tree,

09:36.033 --> 09:37.618
presents to one another.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.581
Looking up at all those dead branches.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.918
And it was depressing. And awful.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.463
But still, within that,
there was a beauty.

09:49.547 --> 09:54.260
And that is the kind of spirit
I am looking for here at Space Force.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.178
Two points.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.597
Uh, it's March,

09:58.097 --> 10:00.391
and that story's very alarming.

10:00.474 --> 10:04.228
Even when my parents were broke,
they still put something under the tree.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.647
One year, we couldn't afford
a karaoke machine,

10:06.731 --> 10:10.026
and they still bought me
a four-dollar plastic mic from CVS.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.820
-Nice.
-You got McNuggets, you spoiled brat.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.904
Stand down, Brad.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.824
I would like to hear
a "Space Force spirit" on three.

10:16.907 --> 10:17.742
One, two, three.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.285
Space Force spirit!

10:19.368 --> 10:20.286
Ah.

10:20.828 --> 10:21.787
Jesus.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.541
We deactivated satellites,
cut non-essential personnel.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.878
Uh, the executive chef,
dining room, it's all gone.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.881
It wasn't easy,
but I think we made our target.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.924
-You're not even close.
-Wha…

10:34.008 --> 10:37.303
You calculated for a calendar year,
not the fiscal year.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.764
You still need to cut
three months of expenses.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.183
There's one item you could slash.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.309
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.894
The Mars mission, that…

10:45.686 --> 10:47.271
that is a no-fly zone.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.524
It's a very, very
important project for Dr. Mallory.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.234
If that were cut, it would crush him.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.987
Then I suggest
you tell him sooner rather than later.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.367
You are so mean.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.041
Ah!

11:07.541 --> 11:08.751
That's my daughter.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.846
-Oh, oops.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.598
B-7.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.102
Stupid machine.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.647
I mean, you're programmed to do one thing,

11:29.730 --> 11:32.942
so what remains clouded in mystery?

11:33.442 --> 11:35.778
Is it the "B"? Is it the sev-- Hey.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.446
You okay?

11:38.489 --> 11:39.699
Fantastic.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.450
It's just a snack, Adrian.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.830
No, I just received
an unwelcome bit of news.

11:46.997 --> 11:47.998
You did?

11:48.749 --> 11:51.669
Yeah, Jerome called.
He had to put the cat down.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.213
Oh!

11:54.296 --> 11:56.507
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.093
I didn't… I didn't realize you had a cat.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.011
It's Jerome's cat, really.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.304
Oh.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.557
Anyway, you wanted to talk to me?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.934
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you
about the Mars…

12:07.017 --> 12:07.852
What?

12:08.602 --> 12:11.731
…bar. The Mars bar.
Does this machine have a Mars bar?

12:12.606 --> 12:13.733
There it is.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.484
Boy, do I love those.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.864
This point, I'd take any snack
out of this fucking machine.

12:19.947 --> 12:25.327
Tell me about it. All right.
Well… anyhoo, good luck with the cat.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.330
Oh shit.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.335
-Welcome! Hello, everybody. Take a seat.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.838
What… What is happening?

12:35.921 --> 12:39.425
You know, I've seen a lot of press,
but this has to be by far

12:39.508 --> 12:43.304
the most attractive and intelligent press
I've seen in my entire life.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.890
Where did they get you from?
Are you models? You all fake press?

12:45.973 --> 12:48.392
Look at this. Model, model, model, model.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.685
This is insane.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.521
Ladies and gentlemen,
without any further ado,

12:52.605 --> 12:54.815
-a hero, a legend…

12:54.899 --> 12:57.818
…the guardian of Space Force,

12:57.902 --> 12:59.904
give it up for Captain Angela Ali.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.030
Let's go!

13:02.406 --> 13:03.240
Fuck.

13:03.324 --> 13:07.161
Hey. Back in the room.
Here we go. Thank you.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.914
-How you doing, Captain?
-Great.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.832
Very good. Let's start it off.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.751
Raising hands.
Looking for a first question.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.835
How about you, sir,

13:14.919 --> 13:16.879
with the razor-sharp cheekbones
in the front row.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.839
Lemme hear a question.
I know you got a good one.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.174
Where are the other astronauts?

13:20.257 --> 13:23.344
The other astronauts all had
previous personal or dental appointments.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.847
You don't worry about that.
Do you have a question for this hero?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.725
I do. Two military superpowers
were on the moon together.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.435
-Was there any tension

13:31.519 --> 13:33.354
coordinating a safe return

13:33.437 --> 13:35.397
for both nations' astronauts?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.983
Yeah. Um…

13:38.067 --> 13:41.237
There… There was a brief
communication breakdown,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.197
but through diplomacy and cooperation,

13:43.280 --> 13:48.369
we were able to work together
to return safely home to erp.

13:49.036 --> 13:49.912
"Erp"?

13:50.496 --> 13:52.373
What? Nah, I said "Earth."

13:52.456 --> 13:55.334
I heard "Earth." You said "Earth." Right?
She said Earth, everybody.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.795
Unbelievable. Diplomacy and cooperation.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.004
I love that answer.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.881
-Great question. Great answer.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.425
Can't believe I get to watch this.
What about a second question?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.802
<i> We have to stay calm or…</i>

14:04.885 --> 14:07.638
You're sucking up our air!
That's American air!

14:07.721 --> 14:09.682
Typical American.
Think they own everything.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.059
You're in our ship!
You're eating our food!

14:12.142 --> 14:13.435
It's our food too!

14:13.519 --> 14:15.813
We're Americans.
We're used to very large portions.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.148
Guys, there's plenty of air.
Air's not going anywhere.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.110
-There's plenty of food too. We're fine!
-And poultry.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.238
It's fine. We just have
to stay calm, or else we're going to die.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.322
Captain Ali.

14:25.948 --> 14:26.949
Captain Ali?

14:27.032 --> 14:29.243
Sorry. What? Did--
Uh, what was the question?

14:29.326 --> 14:31.954
Hey, can we all
stop whispering our questions?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.205
Listen, I know she's a hero,

14:33.289 --> 14:36.792
but it doesn't mean she has super hearing
like Daredevil or Spider-Man, okay?

14:36.876 --> 14:40.004
So, speak up and use our real voices.
Here we go. One more time. In the middle.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.422
Captain Ali, who or what

14:41.505 --> 14:43.465
did you miss most
when you were on the moon?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.050
Shh, shh. Quiet. Here it comes.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.928
<i>Who or what</i>
<i>did I miss the most on the moon?</i>

14:48.012 --> 14:49.305
<i>Um…</i>

14:51.599 --> 14:52.892
<i>Chile picante Corn Nuts.</i>

14:52.975 --> 14:54.351
-Ooh.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.605
That hurts.
Unless your nickname is Corn Nuts.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.899
Shut up, Xyler.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.150
I didn't say anything.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.653
Hey, you should buy her
some of those chile picante Corn Nuts.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.114
You think so?
You don't think that's too pushy?

15:07.197 --> 15:10.242
No. No. I think it shows that you listen.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.914
It's a nice gesture, and it's romantic.
In a mildly spicy way.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.373
That's a great idea.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.417
Corn Nuts? Know how much money
we could be making?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.253
We do not drop names
until Kraft drops checks.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.130
That's our motto.
What is going on with you?

15:23.213 --> 15:25.799
Sorry. The bird kinda threw me off.
Broke my concentration.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.260
Don't blame the bird.
The bird is trending right now.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.180
"Moon bird" is the number one thing,
and nobody has figured out

15:31.263 --> 15:33.807
that it's a totally different bird.
I love that bird.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.434
So let's think about the next interview.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.062
No, I cannot do the next interview.
Or any interview.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.899
Look, I'm gonna be real with you.
I feel like I'm having a hard time.

15:41.982 --> 15:45.527
Okay? Since I got back.
I'm not able to do even small things.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.695
I don't do laundry.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.072
I just… I just buy new clothes,

15:48.155 --> 15:50.991
then I wear 'em until they get dirty,
and I throw 'em out a window.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.743
-That's normal.
No, it is not.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.495
It is normal. Absolutely.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.206
I don't know anybody
who doesn't love buying new clothes,

15:57.289 --> 15:58.582
and who likes doing laundry?

15:58.666 --> 16:01.919
I think I just need a vacation
from talking about the moon.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.337
It's… It's everywhere I go.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.422
"Hey, oh, there's Moon Girl.
Sign my husband's back."

16:05.506 --> 16:08.092
-I need to stop talking about the moon.
-Okay. All right.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.345
Maybe this can be of some help.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.471
Oh, thank God.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.390
-No, no. Of course not.
-What?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.642
-Immediately you put it in your mouth?
-I don't know.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.019
That is an anchorman's earpiece.
You put that in your ear.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.063
I'm gonna be off to the side
feeding you lines.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.024
You just say what I say.
You could shut off your brain for a sec.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.734
You really think this is gonna work?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.696
I know it'll work.
Baby, I know it'll work.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.660
Albertson, now is not a good time.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.997
I am not in the mood
for your NASA bullshit.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.624
<i>I wouldn't hang up on me</i>
<i>if I were you, Adrian.</i>

16:40.708 --> 16:42.751
<i>I have some info</i>
<i>you might be interested in.</i>

16:42.835 --> 16:44.169
Mallory yawns.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.006
<i>The little birdie that told me</i>
<i>about your budget cuts,</i>

16:47.089 --> 16:49.133
<i>he or she has a friend in the Pentagon,</i>

16:49.216 --> 16:52.386
<i>and they're looking at replacements</i>
<i>for, guess who, General Naird.</i>

16:52.469 --> 16:55.180
Hey, do you have
any real evidence of this?

16:55.723 --> 16:58.350
Or it's just
your "little birdie" bullshit?

16:58.434 --> 17:01.353
<i>Is a copy of the official list</i>
<i>of candidates enough evidence for you?</i>

17:01.437 --> 17:04.481
Shit. This day just keeps getting worse.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.903
Uh, I think I'll take that one, please.
Thank you.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.866
-Buying a muffin?
-I am, yes.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.076
Good choice. Is that cranberry?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.787
Cranberry, yeah.
They were out of blueberry, so…

17:18.871 --> 17:20.205
Darn. Well.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.373
I love muffins.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.460
Uh, Mark, I… I was wondering,

17:24.543 --> 17:27.546
might I be able
to speak with you privately?

17:28.589 --> 17:29.757
Sure. Yeah.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.676
Actually, I need to talk to you too,
in private.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.261
Okay.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.597
Why don't we go outside? Go for a walk.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.182
Yeah. Let's…

17:38.265 --> 17:42.811
We should, yeah, outside, I think.
Out of the… the doors. Outside.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.897
That sounds good.
Get outside. Get some fresh air.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.356
-Sure.
-Away from people.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.484
Away from people and breakable objects.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.695
-Yeah. I can eat my muffin out there.
-Do you want a bag for that?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.155
No. I'm good. I'm good.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.449
-A napkin?
-No, I'll just go commando.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.617
Ah. Okay.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.411
-Nice to be outside.
-Yeah.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.955
It is nice outside. Uh…

18:03.123 --> 18:05.334
-Never knew we had so many guards.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.710
So, Mark, um…

18:07.628 --> 18:09.755
there's no way to sugarcoat this.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.383
I have some very bad news to impart.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.302
You have bad news for me?

18:15.385 --> 18:17.179
Yes, you're gonna hate it. I hate it.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.848
Adrian, I have… I have bad news for you.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.266
Oh, believe me. Mine's worse.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.476
I think mine's worse.

18:22.559 --> 18:26.396
But how would we determine that
without first knowing both bits of news?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.066
Well, that's true, but what's worse?
Getting the bad news first--

18:29.149 --> 18:31.026
-First. Second.
-I think it's second.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.402
-Well-- It's--
-Or first.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.989
You know what? Just rip the Band-Aid off.
Tell me my bad news.

18:36.073 --> 18:40.536
The administration
is looking to replace you at Space Force.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.621
What?

18:42.704 --> 18:44.123
A colleague of mine,

18:44.206 --> 18:49.837
rather a parasite
that attached itself to my gills at NASA,

18:49.920 --> 18:52.798
found out, and he sent me the list
of possible replacements.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.425
No, no, no, no.
I don't want to see the list of po--

18:55.509 --> 18:57.052
But you said to rip the Band-Aid off.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.055
Yes, I did, but I didn't say
rub salt in the wound

19:00.139 --> 19:01.932
and then put a lit cigarette in it.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.976
-No, but I told you my news was worse.
-Oh…

19:04.059 --> 19:05.727
-No, no, mine is worse.
-I told you.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.104
No, it can't… What is it?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.480
The Mars mission is canceled.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.982
-No!
-Yes.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.400
-No!
-I'm sorry.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.111
-I tried to warn you-- Yes.
-No! Say no!

19:14.194 --> 19:16.905
-I'm not saying no because it's yes.
-Please! Say no.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.240
-I can't.
-Fuck!

19:18.323 --> 19:19.533
Fuck, I know. I know.

19:19.616 --> 19:20.742
Fuck!

19:22.369 --> 19:23.495
Fuck!

19:26.039 --> 19:28.375
-Okay.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.085
Get it out.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.015
-Better?
-Yeah. Fine.

19:43.974 --> 19:44.892
-You?

19:44.975 --> 19:46.185
Fine. Fine.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.811
Your muffin isn't.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.229
Yeah.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.524
They told me I had four months.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.986
Yeah, I hate those cheap,
lying D.C. bean counters.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.572
I know.
Well, I'm sorry about the Mars mission.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.949
I know you would've saved it
if you could've.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.242
Well, I'm sorry.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.536
-I'm sorry.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.413
Oh Jesus.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.499
You know who we have to tell
about the Mars mission?

20:09.583 --> 20:10.542
Who?

20:14.504 --> 20:15.380
Oh, boy.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.965
Yeah, "Oh, boy."

20:18.926 --> 20:20.552
All right. All right.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.804
It has to be done.
Do you want me to do this?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.682
It's okay. I'll do it.
It's my job.

20:25.766 --> 20:26.767
Okay.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.311
<i>Oh, yay! A call!</i>

20:29.394 --> 20:32.648
<i>Guys, this is great. Hi! Hi!</i>

20:33.232 --> 20:35.692
-Hello, Captain Lancaster. How are you?
-Hello.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.945
<i>I'm… Fine. I'm fine.</i>

20:38.028 --> 20:39.905
<i>You know, I miss… I miss Earth,</i>

20:39.988 --> 20:41.990
<i>and, uh, my family,</i>

20:42.074 --> 20:43.742
<i>and food,</i>

20:43.825 --> 20:47.287
<i>and, uh, standing up in gravity,</i>
<i>and, you know…</i>

20:47.371 --> 20:50.165
<i>Apparently, my heart</i>
<i>has shrunken a little bit.</i>

20:50.249 --> 20:51.875
<i>But that's… I'm okay.</i>

20:51.959 --> 20:55.087
<i>You know, nobody likes a whiner,</i>
<i>so tell me to shut up. </i>

20:55.170 --> 20:57.881
<i>It'll all be worth it</i>
<i>when I finally set foot on Mars.</i>

20:57.965 --> 20:59.841
<i>Thrill of a lifetime that I've…</i>

21:00.592 --> 21:02.761
<i>that I've waited my whole existence for.</i>

21:04.096 --> 21:05.931
<i>My name will be written in history.</i>

21:06.014 --> 21:09.935
Yes, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.146
<i>Oh, but wait, wait. I…</i>
<i>Sorry. I have so many questions. Um…</i>

21:13.230 --> 21:16.358
<i>How's my boy?</i>
<i>I haven't held him since he was born.</i>

21:16.441 --> 21:18.402
Doing well. Doing well.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.946
He spoke his first words.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.406
<i>What were they?</i>

21:23.073 --> 21:23.991
"I…

21:25.033 --> 21:26.326
love daddy."

21:26.410 --> 21:27.911
What the fuck are you doing?

21:27.995 --> 21:30.330
<i>That's wonderful. That's wonderful.</i>

21:32.708 --> 21:33.875
-Yeah.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.670
<i>Okay. Hey, how are my New York Jets doing?</i>

21:37.421 --> 21:39.673
-You have to tell him.
The Jets…

21:42.134 --> 21:43.260
Uh…

21:43.343 --> 21:45.012
-I… I can't do this.
-Yes, you can.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.472
General Naird has something to tell you.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.683
Nah. All right. Yes.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.893
-Go ahead.
-Okay. Yep.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.980
Hello, Captain Lancaster.
This is General Naird.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.734
And there's something
that I need to tell you.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.612
Your Jets are going to the Super Bowl!

22:02.696 --> 22:05.782
-<i>Oh my.</i>
-They're probably gonna win.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.993
<i>A miracle. A miracle.</i>

22:08.076 --> 22:09.036
Yep.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.871
Jesus Christ.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.791
Oh, I'm so nervous.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.626
What if it backfires?

22:16.710 --> 22:18.670
<i>Prepare to get rich, girl.</i>

22:18.754 --> 22:20.464
Okay. Get ready.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.842
Three, two, one.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.678
I did it.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.638
Captain Ali, you've been the subject

22:28.722 --> 22:31.433
of so much attention
since returning from the moon.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.226
Is it hard adjusting to the spotlight?

22:33.310 --> 22:35.687
-Funny thing about a spotlight.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.231
It illuminates the exteriors

22:38.315 --> 22:40.525
when the real light of a person

22:40.609 --> 22:43.737
<i>-…shines most from within.</i>
-…shines most from an inn.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.906
Um, an inn?

22:46.698 --> 22:47.824
Like a Days Inn?

22:47.908 --> 22:50.952
<i>-Within. Sorry. I made a mistake.</i>
-Within. Sorry. I made a mistake.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.746
-Within.
-Ah. Within.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.206
-Okay.
-Sorry.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.919
The Chinese and American astronauts
both returned home in the same capsule.

22:59.002 --> 22:59.836
Yes.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.297
Was there ever a moment on the moon
when you thought,

23:03.256 --> 23:04.674
"I might not be coming home."

23:04.758 --> 23:05.842
-Definitely not.
-Definitely.

23:05.926 --> 23:06.802
-Not!
-Not.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.512
-Definitely not.
-Say, "Definitely not."

23:08.595 --> 23:11.139
Def… I said, "Definitely not."
Is what I said.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.643
Okay, um, shall we move on?

23:14.726 --> 23:15.769
-Yep.
-Okay.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.438
Something so many of us want to know…

23:18.522 --> 23:22.859
You have been called an American hero.
What does the word "hero" mean to you?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.403
This is a great question.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.738
-This is a great… Yeah, thank…
<i>-Thanks for asking.</i>

23:26.822 --> 23:28.615
<i>Heroes. Rosa Parks.</i>

23:28.698 --> 23:30.700
-No. I'm sorry. I can't do this.
<i>-Serena Williams.</i>

23:30.784 --> 23:32.994
-I cannot handle the word "hero."
-No? What are you doing?

23:33.078 --> 23:35.705
I'm done with it today, okay?
I'm done. I'm not a hero.

23:35.789 --> 23:36.832
I'm an astronaut.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.752
General Naird, he gave me
an opportunity to go to the moon.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.923
And I did, and I came back safely.
We did that under his leadership.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.468
We were just… We were just doing our jobs.
And… I don't know.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.304
I am not a hero,
but you know who is a real hero?

23:51.388 --> 23:52.681
And I'm serious about this.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.350
The people who make
chile picante Corn Nuts.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.269
-I know.

23:57.352 --> 24:00.480
But they are.
Or whoever makes my awesome drum kit.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.565
That's a hero.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.192
Little kids
who do their homework every day.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.821
People who do their laundry. I don't…
I don't do any of that, and I'm…

24:08.363 --> 24:10.157
Those are the real heroes. Not me.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.454
Well, you heard it here first.
We're all heroes.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.415
And this coming from a real American hero.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.625
And apparently, a drummer.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.086
Thank you so much.
You did an amazing job.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.921
-Thanks. Sorry.
-"We're all heroes"?

24:25.005 --> 24:28.049
-I know.
-No, it was amazing. Look at this.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.510
"Drummer Moon Girl"
is trending right this second.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.054
There's already a meme of you.
Look at that thing go.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.475
Great.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.101
Yeah! It's super great.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.270
What a day, huh?

24:40.353 --> 24:42.439
What a shit show.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.608
We've all lost resources.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.860
We lost the Mars mission.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.446
Brad lost his testicle chair.

24:49.529 --> 24:53.825
So we thought it might be a good idea
to gather everyone together

24:53.909 --> 24:55.535
and wish you

24:55.619 --> 24:56.953
a merry Christmas!

24:57.454 --> 24:58.538
Merry Christmas.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.248
-But it's March.
-Come on in!

25:00.332 --> 25:02.334
-Happy holidays. Merry Christmas.
-Whoa.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.336
-Merry Christmas.
-Nice.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.088
I'm helping with this.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.176
Karaoke machine!

25:11.259 --> 25:13.094
-Wow!
-"Party Rocker Max."

25:13.178 --> 25:15.096
-Cool.
-Thank you, General.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.682
-You're welcome.
-Wait, I can't find any dance music.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.683
Check Dua Lipa.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.352
No, but they got "Jingle Bells."

25:20.435 --> 25:22.729
It's mostly public domain Christmas music.

25:22.812 --> 25:26.316
What about the collected works
of Alvin and the Chipmunks?

25:28.068 --> 25:29.027
"O Holy Night."

25:32.113 --> 25:33.198
Mariah Carey.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.324
Mariah Carey.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.326
What do you think about this text?

25:36.409 --> 25:38.662
I think I'm gonna send it
with a singing emoji.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.205
Cute.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.623
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.497
Where's Angela?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.249
I don't know. She just left.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.669
Hey, be honest.
Do you think she's seeing another guy?

26:27.752 --> 26:29.462
I don't know. Let's join in. Here we go.
