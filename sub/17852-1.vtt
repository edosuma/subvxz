01:22.666 --> 01:25.624
Good morning. Hermes Cable TV.
Can I help you?

01:25.669 --> 01:28.331
I've been waitin' all morning for your guy.
Where is he?

01:28.380 --> 01:32.840
He's probably tied up in the field, sir.
I'm sure he'll be there soon. Please hold.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.587
No, wait!

01:36.388 --> 01:38.675
What gives with this?

01:39.266 --> 01:41.132
Look at the time.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.846
What is this? Oh, this is ridiculous.

01:55.574 --> 01:59.568
- Hermes Cable TV.
- It's me again. He's still not here!

01:59.703 --> 02:04.448
I'm sure he's on his way. He's one of
our most reliable men. Please hold.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.623
No! Don't put...

02:07.294 --> 02:12.084
If you wanna get anything done, you gotta
do it yourself. Come on, you son of...

02:22.267 --> 02:24.725
- Hermes Cable TV.
- Hello. Hello!

02:24.770 --> 02:26.807
Please hold.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.564
- Are you still holding?
- I've got somethin' for you to hold, lady.

02:30.609 --> 02:34.728
Sir, if this is an obscene phone call,
we have ways of tracing it.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.738
I want you to trace it.
I demand that you trace it!

02:37.824 --> 02:39.610
My address is...

02:42.537 --> 02:44.574
Die!

02:48.335 --> 02:49.666
Thank you!

03:31.002 --> 03:33.585
Where the hell have you been?

03:34.172 --> 03:36.584
I've been waiting over four hours!

03:36.633 --> 03:40.627
Our cable went down on the West Side.
I've been up to my ass all morning.

03:40.721 --> 03:45.306
- I waited three weeks for an appointment!
- You think I enjoy doin' this to people?

03:45.392 --> 03:49.886
OK, it's not your fault. I'm sorry.
Forget it, OK? There it is right there. OK?

03:49.980 --> 03:52.017
Sorry. I am.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.101
- What have you got?
- I got a black bar on 2, sometimes on 7.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.611
It's probably the connector.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.565
You've been playin' with this,
haven't you?

04:02.659 --> 04:05.196
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.536
No, I haven't!

04:08.707 --> 04:11.995
You ain't got nothin' on here.
HBO, Disney, nothin'.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.079
- Just a black bar on 2, sometimes on 7.
- You want 'em?

04:17.173 --> 04:21.589
I can give 'em to you for... 50 bucks?

04:27.726 --> 04:30.013
Nobody's gotta know.

04:31.563 --> 04:36.774
Yeah. Give me the whole thing. I'll take
the whole package. OK. Set me up.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.611
- Forget it. Don't do it.
- What?

04:41.698 --> 04:45.066
I don't want it. They'll catch me.
They will. I know that.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.197
All right. Suit yourself.

04:47.245 --> 04:51.660
- You fixed it! How did you do that?
- It was the connector.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.542
- Pretty good, huh?
- Terrific. Oh, yeah.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.250
Give me this. I wanna hear it.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.718
What's the rush, Paul?

05:12.813 --> 05:17.683
Rachel, your father is still
in intensive care, and I am still his doctor.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.226
I don't want you to go!

05:20.278 --> 05:23.361
But, Rachel, your father could die!

05:23.406 --> 05:27.024
We all have to die... Sometime.

05:27.077 --> 05:32.288
- Jeez, what a body!
- Laura is more than a body.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.705
- Laura?
- Laura Claybourne. She plays Rachel.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.916
Sorry. You must really follow this shit.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.082
No. I write this shit.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.348
Yes, Mom, I got the brownies.

05:52.477 --> 05:56.436
And the Mace.
Mom, will you please stop worrying?

05:56.481 --> 05:59.564
Everyone gets mugged here
at least once a week.

06:10.829 --> 06:15.118
Guess what. I'm going up for
a part on your favorite soap.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.284
Beyond Our Dreams. Yes, really!

06:22.215 --> 06:24.377
Just a minute, operator.
Hang on, Mom.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.208
Oh, shoot!

06:28.638 --> 06:30.925
I'll be right there, Morn!

06:33.977 --> 06:37.186
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
Here, let me help you up.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.222
Jeez. I am sorry.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.403
Are those real?

06:47.407 --> 06:50.399
- I don't know what to say.
- Excuse me. I'm on a call.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.030
These things happen, I guess.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.493
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't see you.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.541
I didn't see her. I just didn't see her!

07:02.213 --> 07:04.329
Morn, you can't believe what...

07:11.431 --> 07:14.423
Where have you been?
You missed the run-through.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.851
Monday's show is two minutes over.
The Sherwoods cut a scene.

07:17.938 --> 07:23.183
Without telling me? They said we'd
discuss it. They're always doin' this!

07:24.194 --> 07:27.107
- Did you get that refrigerator for Laura?
- Yeah.

07:27.197 --> 07:31.031
- That should keep her happy for a week.
- Mickey, I know you don't like her,

07:31.117 --> 07:34.530
but she's very sensitive. She's got
more going on than people think.

07:34.621 --> 07:39.366
Is it visible to the naked eye? Jack, when
are you gonna stop kiddin' yourself?

07:39.459 --> 07:43.453
What are you talkin' about? There's
nothin' goin' on between me and Laura.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.083
I know that. But do you?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.839
Mr. Sherwood, if you hold one sec...
Jack! Please!

08:02.107 --> 08:04.348
Nervous, huh?

08:04.401 --> 08:07.359
Don't worry, honey, it's just a reading.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.032
Not bad.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.412
- Hey, Jack.
- Hi. You got those eight by tens great.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.671
- Are you all right?
- I'm gettin' used to it.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.967
I am really sorry.

08:34.054 --> 08:37.764
Oh, no! What am I gonna do?
I've got an interview in five minutes!

08:37.851 --> 08:42.812
An interview? Oh, for the production
secretary? I'll make sure you get it.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.138
No, I'm not a secretary. I'm an actress.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.601
- What are you up for? The lesbian maid?
- No, Janet Dubois.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.269
Janet?

08:50.321 --> 08:54.861
You can't be here for Janet.
We're not using Janet.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.819
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I'm supposed to read for Janet.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.029
- I'm here to see the Shervvoods.
- The Shervvoods?

09:01.124 --> 09:02.785
- Yes.
- I knew it.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.496
We agreed on no Janet!
Now they're bringin' in Janet!

09:05.754 --> 09:08.121
Goin' behind my back again.
I'm the producer.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.455
And you're not gonna get away with it!

09:10.508 --> 09:12.624
Move! Come on!

09:13.094 --> 09:14.880
Why is he doing this to me?

09:16.389 --> 09:21.475
What the hell is going on? Why are you
casting Janet? You're always doing this.

09:21.561 --> 09:26.647
Jack, we're just meeting a few actresses.
I mean, we might use Janet down the line.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.729
But we agreed Janet
wasn't interesting. She's dull.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.561
All right. No Janet. Happy?

09:35.408 --> 09:38.366
It's just that we should
discuss these things.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.702
We read your new bible. Some good stuff.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.531
- Oh, thanks.
- And some bad stuff, too.

09:43.625 --> 09:47.960
You got the Hedisons losing all their
money. What kind of bullshit is that?

09:48.004 --> 09:51.167
Arlene, I don't like
the hostility I'm hearing.

09:51.216 --> 09:56.086
People like the Hedisons just the way
they are: rich, ruthless, glitzy.

09:56.179 --> 09:59.547
I just think the audience'll love
that Rachel has to get a job!

09:59.641 --> 10:03.726
Jack, I thought we already discussed
this whole thing about Rachel.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.304
What whole thing?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.728
Oh, no! Rachel stays in the show.

10:10.819 --> 10:15.188
Listen, boychik, Laura's contract
is coming up. Do you have any idea

10:15.240 --> 10:18.904
how much money those mamzers
at the William Morris office are asking?

10:18.993 --> 10:22.281
She's worth it! Rachel works great
and so does my new bible!

10:22.372 --> 10:26.240
Jack, if you'll excuse me,
part of your new bible works great.

10:26.334 --> 10:31.374
We both love this Jack Gates character,
this Wolf of Wall Street. It's brilliant.

10:31.422 --> 10:35.507
Great character, great.
But forget Rachel! She's out!

10:35.677 --> 10:41.719
We got a good idea. Rachel is horseback
riding with Paul. The horse throws her.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.383
Goodbye, Laura.
Goodbye, Morris Agency.

10:44.435 --> 10:48.975
- No. Forget it.
- Or we can give her a brain tumour.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.854
Wonderful, a brain tumour! What's that,
the third brain tumour this season?

10:52.902 --> 10:55.735
- So what?
- Jack, it's a long season.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.984
Oh, I don't believe this!

10:58.074 --> 11:02.534
Come on! This sounds like the kinda crap
Arnie Fetterman would come up with!

11:02.579 --> 11:06.322
You're bringin' in Arnie Fetterman,
aren't you? He's gonna rewrite me.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.282
Absolutely not.

11:08.376 --> 11:12.244
Are we gonna bring in hamburger
when we already have steak on the table?

11:12.338 --> 11:15.706
You'll kill the show! You don't know
what the hell you're doing!

11:15.758 --> 11:19.296
How dare you talk to us like that?
Do you hear the mouth he's opening?

11:19.512 --> 11:24.052
I'm sorry. I don't like fighting and arguing.
I just feel very strongly about this.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.264
Who cares how you feel?
This is a television show.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.935
Arlene, he's talking feelings.
We have to listen.

11:33.026 --> 11:38.612
I'll tell you what. You think about Rachel
and we'll think about Rachel. Is that fair?

11:38.656 --> 11:42.194
- I guess.
- So what's with the long face?

11:42.285 --> 11:44.526
We'll work things out.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.329
There's a lot of love in this room, Jack.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.921
We love you. And we hope you love us.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.466
- Of course I love you. It's just I still...
- We'll talk Monday.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.470
- What about me? Don't you love me?
- I included you in that love.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.976
- He meant you.
- I meant you.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.813
Schmuck.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.147
Ceil, get me Arnie Fetterman.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.321
Yeah. Yeah, Arlene, I told you,
I'll work the Janet character into the story.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.662
I'm getting rid of Rachel with
the horseback riding, even <i>as</i> we speak.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.114
Now will ya stop nudging?

12:34.170 --> 12:36.832
Quiet, everybody! Roll cameras.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.676
Billionaire patriarch Carter Hedison,

12:42.887 --> 12:47.506
having recently recovered from
a brain tumour, battles death once again

12:47.558 --> 12:52.098
as his ambitious daughter Rachel
plots her next move.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.555
Will she marry Dr. Paul Kirkwood,

12:54.649 --> 12:58.859
or will she learn of his affair
with Nurse Helen Caldwell?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.985
Which began, ironically,

13:01.406 --> 13:05.695
in the very bed now occupied
by her stricken father.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.861
Well, Paul? How's he doing?

13:08.913 --> 13:13.908
These heart-lung-liver transplants are
almost routine. He'll be as good as new.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.588
That you, Blake? Come over here, son.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.548
Dad.

13:26.889 --> 13:31.975
Now, you do what Nurse Caldwell
tells you to, Daddy. I'll stop by later.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.019
Blake, I'm so glad you're here.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.989
You look good, Dad.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.571
I don't want Blake
to see my father any more.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.204
What?

13:53.916 --> 13:58.080
If anything happens to the old fool, do you
want Blake taking over the company?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.919
You're playing a dangerous game, Rachel.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.885
They're the only kind worth playing.

14:09.682 --> 14:14.017
- Cut it! Very nice.
- Was that big enough? I can give more.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.471
- No, no, Dennis, that was fine. Thank you.
- "Cos" I got more!

14:17.690 --> 14:19.931
- Am I good in this?
- Really, really good.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.235
- Feels perfect. I feel very strong.
- No, it was perfect.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.397
- It's strong. It's strong.
- It's not in the lines.

14:26.449 --> 14:30.443
- You've gotta play the moment. That's it.
- You had some wonderful moments.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.867
- I thought it was over between them.
- I think he just got his key back.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.747
- Good scene. Really. Great scene.
- Oh, you think so?

14:39.796 --> 14:43.960
- Oh, yeah. Do you have a minute, Laura?
- For you, always.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.798
Thanks. I was wondering if you read the
new bible. With the Jack Gates character.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.302
- Oh, yes. I love it.
- Really?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.472
- It's very good.
- Great!

14:52.517 --> 14:55.179
It works beautifully for the rest of the cast.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.636
Oh, thanks. The rest of the cast?

14:58.856 --> 15:04.442
To be honest, I don't think the audience
will accept Rachel as a working girl.

15:04.487 --> 15:09.732
You said you wanted to do something
with more depth. It'd be good for you.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.574
I hope you're not upset.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.158
You're so open.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.449
You're the only one I can really talk to.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.493
Oh, come on!

15:21.546 --> 15:24.254
And I can't thank you enough
for the refrigerator.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.707
No problem. Are you kidding?

15:26.801 --> 15:29.088
Jesus H Christ, Laura!

15:30.263 --> 15:33.676
I thought you meant
one of those little office ones.

15:33.724 --> 15:37.217
Is something wrong?
If it's gonna cause a problem...

15:38.062 --> 15:40.554
No! No problem at all!

15:41.524 --> 15:44.141
It's OK. It's a beauty.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.023
When are you gonna buy a computer?

15:52.452 --> 15:55.570
I gotta get outta here.
Traffic's gonna be awful.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.155
God, what is wrong with me?

16:03.129 --> 16:06.542
I found this Nat King Cole
on a farm in Pennsylvania.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.174
There's only two left in the entire world.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.256
No.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.013
Yeah? Hi!

16:16.517 --> 16:19.726
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

16:20.062 --> 16:23.100
- Laura.
- I'll turn down the lights.

16:23.191 --> 16:28.903
I hate myself for doing this to you,
but I just had a terrible fight with Dennis.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.736
- It's over this time. Can we have dinner?
- I can't.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.617
What do you mean?

16:39.415 --> 16:43.158
I can't. I just can't.
I'm goin' to Vermont this weekend.

16:43.252 --> 16:48.247
They're having an auction on old records.
You know my Nat King Cole collection.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.088
If it's OK, I'd like to go with you.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.728
Hello?

17:03.773 --> 17:05.855
No problem!

17:06.817 --> 17:09.775
I just can't bear
the thought of being alone.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.775
Please. I won't be in your way.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.364
She wants to go with me for the weekend.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.696
What does she want now? A stove?

17:23.459 --> 17:28.295
You know, when I think back about
Dennis, you know what the truth is?

17:28.381 --> 17:32.875
He doesn't like women.
I swear, he does not like women!

17:33.469 --> 17:37.508
What have you got in here? You know,
we're just goin' for the weekend.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.901
Laura!

17:54.865 --> 17:58.278
It's too late.
We have nothing to say to each other.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.577
Laura, I...

18:40.369 --> 18:42.701
Honk on this, butt-head!

18:55.551 --> 18:58.669
Mickey's right.
I'm bein' a jerk about Laura.

19:00.765 --> 19:04.724
Well, she's not gonna ruin my weekend.
I'm gonna have fun!

19:25.915 --> 19:27.952
Well, I'm glad to see you're up.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.753
What the hell are you two doin' here?
Hey, Dennis, knock it off.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.671
Lee.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.749
What's goin' on here?

19:38.636 --> 19:42.300
I'm Dr. Paul Kirkwood
and this is Nurse Helen Caldwell.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.178
- What am I doin' on the set?
- Set?

19:47.728 --> 19:51.141
Oh, I get it. All right.
Yeah, Mickey. OK, very funny.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.600
- Wait. Now, hang on.
- Where's Mickey? OK, Mickey.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.903
Joke is over. Thank you.
Back to work, everybody.

20:05.079 --> 20:10.791
Jesus! When did we build this?
We're gonna go way over budget!

20:11.168 --> 20:13.626
I don't understand. His tests were normal.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.455
Maybe we should do some more.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.341
This...

20:21.679 --> 20:23.716
Isn't a set, is it?

20:23.806 --> 20:28.346
Set? You're in Ashford Falls
Community Hospital.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.644
- Ashford Falls?
- That's right.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.522
I can't be in Ashford Falls.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.274
There is no Ashford Falls!

20:41.323 --> 20:43.906
See for yourself.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.655
OK, I'll bite.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.907
OK, OK.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.050
This can't be!

21:13.606 --> 21:15.688
I must be dead.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.233
I am dead!

21:19.862 --> 21:21.569
I'm in hell!

21:21.697 --> 21:26.066
And my punishment
is spending eternity on my own show!

21:26.577 --> 21:30.241
- Oh, no!
- You better get 20 milligrams of Valium.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.038
- Not on this show!
- Take it easy.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.786
Please, not this show!

21:35.544 --> 21:37.956
You said we'd go to the mountains.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.460
I'm sorry, Helen.
I've got to see Carter Hedison.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.957
Carter?

21:43.552 --> 21:46.135
Or Rachel Hedison?

21:46.388 --> 21:49.551
I'm OK. I'm fine.

21:49.683 --> 21:54.268
I'm OK. I'm just nervous
in hospitals, that's all.

21:54.355 --> 21:57.063
I'm in Ashford Falls.
I had a car wreck last night.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.434
You're Dr. Kirkwood.
And I panicked a little.

22:00.528 --> 22:05.318
- Follow my finger.
- Sure. See? I've never felt better.

22:05.407 --> 22:10.402
- Will you be quiet?
- OK, Doctor. Anything you say, Doctor.

22:10.454 --> 22:14.413
Get your clothes on. I wanna see you
in my office tomorrow morning.

22:14.458 --> 22:18.417
No problem. I'll be in your dressing room...
Your office at nine o'clock.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.420
You better make it 10.30.
I'm in surgery all morning.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.706
Oh, sure. No problem. Bye-bye!

22:26.887 --> 22:29.128
Thank you both!

22:29.265 --> 22:33.850
He's operating on people?
He's an actor! He's not even a good one!

22:34.937 --> 22:38.771
- I'm telling you, I can walk!
- And I'm telling you, hospital regulations.

22:39.024 --> 22:43.188
- You can walk when you're outside.
- Oh, this is ridiculous!

22:43.279 --> 22:48.115
I'm gonna get your discharge papers.
Just stay put! Boy, what a pain!

22:51.787 --> 22:53.824
Are you ready for this?

22:53.914 --> 22:58.249
Dr. Kirkwood is just stringing you along!
He's gonna dump you and marry Rachel!

23:03.632 --> 23:08.798
Lee, you think you got a small part now,
how would you like a brain tumour?

23:10.973 --> 23:14.091
OK, we're outside. Can I stand up now?

23:16.061 --> 23:18.473
I had your things taken to the hotel.

23:18.689 --> 23:23.229
But I didn't use your real name,
just like you said in the letter. God!

23:23.319 --> 23:27.233
- This is kind of exciting.
- Letter? What letter?

23:29.199 --> 23:32.191
I used the name
that you gave at the hospital.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.527
You know: Jack Gable.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.989
That is my name!

23:37.041 --> 23:41.581
We met at the office.
Don't you recognize me? I ran into you.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.911
I crushed your hand.

23:45.883 --> 23:49.001
I've never been to your office, Mr. Gates.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.337
Gates? You think I'm Jack Gates?

23:53.766 --> 23:56.474
Oh, come on, let's get in the car.

23:56.518 --> 24:00.432
Gosh, I am so excited.
You're buying my father's formula.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.878
Daddy!

24:35.849 --> 24:38.216
He's in the study, sir.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.348
- Which one?
- The one to your right, sir.

24:43.232 --> 24:48.272
What do you think, Blake? If we lose
the daycare center and the playground,

24:49.530 --> 24:53.114
we can park much closer to our office.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.157
Great, Dad.

24:56.412 --> 25:01.623
Daddy! I found out who Janet Dubois
is selling her father's formula to!

25:01.917 --> 25:03.373
It's Jack Gates!

25:06.672 --> 25:08.879
The Wolf of Wall Street?

25:08.924 --> 25:13.418
I've been following Janet. She checked
this guy calling himself Jack Gable

25:13.512 --> 25:15.924
- into the hotel...
- Get to the point, Ty.

25:15.973 --> 25:22.265
Well, I saw his bags, Daddy.
They had the initials JG. JG, Jack Gates.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.895
So they have the same initials.

25:24.940 --> 25:29.059
Yeah, the same initials, and they're both
from New York, and he was with Janet.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.896
That doesn't make him Gates.
Forget it, Ty.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.657
We don't even know if Fletcher Dubois
came up with that formula.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.076
But what if he did, Dad?

25:39.121 --> 25:43.661
It'd be just like Jack Gates
to buy it out from under us.

25:43.751 --> 25:48.461
I think you're on to something, Blake.
Check into it right away.

25:48.505 --> 25:54.171
I'm checking into it! I mean, why does it
always have to be Blake, Daddy?

25:54.261 --> 25:57.799
- It was my idea in the first place!
- Lighten up, Ty.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.803
You're just like your mother.
Too thin-skinned.

26:01.852 --> 26:05.140
I suppose that's why
she committed suicide.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.894
If it was suicide.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.476
For the very last time,

26:12.446 --> 26:16.656
I did not hire Dash Andrews
to kill your mother.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.819
If she was my mother!

26:25.501 --> 26:27.833
Another one of those headaches, son?

26:30.839 --> 26:34.332
I don't care what you think.
I am not Jack Gates!

26:34.384 --> 26:36.921
And you are not Janet Dubois!

26:37.012 --> 26:40.095
You can't be!
You're an offstage character!

26:40.182 --> 26:42.765
- A what?
- We talked about bringing you into it,

26:43.018 --> 26:47.228
but frankly, you weren't that interesting.
You're not even supposed to be here.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.523
But I am here.
I came back to visit my father.

26:50.567 --> 26:54.526
Ah, yes, your father. Fletcher Dubois,
the brilliant but unstable chemist

26:54.571 --> 26:58.030
- who is developing a formula...
- Is developing a formula?

26:58.117 --> 27:00.825
Mr. Gates, my father died four weeks ago.

27:00.869 --> 27:05.989
Oh, yeah. We had to get rid of him.
Because he couldn't remember his lines!

27:07.209 --> 27:13.626
It's the Sherwoods! They did hire
Fetterman. They're messin' with my bible.

27:13.715 --> 27:18.209
What bible? What are you talking about?
You agreed to buy my father's formula!

27:18.637 --> 27:23.723
Oh, what's the use? I know you may
find this hard to believe, but I'm a writer.

27:24.101 --> 27:27.139
Now, I know this may sound crazy,

27:27.563 --> 27:30.146
but I created this whole town!

27:31.692 --> 27:35.651
- I see. You created this whole town.
- Yes!

27:37.239 --> 27:39.731
I'm getting out of here. Where's my car?

27:39.825 --> 27:42.192
It's at Len's Garage.
It needed a new radiator.

27:42.244 --> 27:46.909
Len? There is no Len.
We haven't used Len in two years!

27:47.291 --> 27:49.828
What is happening to me?

27:56.383 --> 27:59.296
- Oh, God!
- What are you doing?

28:00.554 --> 28:02.841
This isn't a dream. I'm not dreaming.

28:02.931 --> 28:06.765
Why are you playing these games
with me, Mr. Gates?

28:06.852 --> 28:11.096
For the last time, lady, I'm not Gates!

28:11.190 --> 28:16.310
I'm a writer! Do you hear me? All I wanna
do is get outta this stinkin' little town!

28:16.403 --> 28:22.149
Well, then, do it! I mean, you say
you're a writer. Then write your way out!

28:32.711 --> 28:38.457
Operator? Yes, could you get me - this
ought to be rich - Len's Garage, please?

28:40.135 --> 28:43.548
What a mistake Len was.
Boy, did we get letters.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.023
Len here.

29:01.031 --> 29:04.569
- Len?
- Like I told Janet, it needs a new radiator.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.402
It'll be a few days.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.363
Hey, mister, I can't work miracles.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.425
"Write your way out."

29:36.817 --> 29:39.935
This is insane. Absolutely insane.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.730
"Write your way out."

29:53.166 --> 29:55.203
Fade in.

29:55.585 --> 29:59.749
Interior, Len's Garage. Day.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.836
Len finds a new radiator

30:02.884 --> 30:05.717
for Mr. Gable's car.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.929
Len calls Mr. Gable

30:09.016 --> 30:12.225
to let him know it is fixed.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.454
Hello?

30:33.540 --> 30:35.952
Len? What?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.454
You found a new radiator for my car?

30:41.173 --> 30:44.165
You did? You found it?

30:44.259 --> 30:47.297
Len, no! I'm not laughing at you! No!

30:47.387 --> 30:50.925
No. Thank you!
I'm thanking you! Yes!

30:51.600 --> 30:54.433
I'll be right over! It worked!

31:07.949 --> 31:10.486
What the hell happened?

31:12.829 --> 31:15.947
I don't wanna know.
I just don't wanna know.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.083
I gotta get outta here.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.795
Hey! Taxi!

31:27.886 --> 31:30.548
Hey, wait a second! Taxi!

31:47.114 --> 31:48.821
Laura!

31:50.367 --> 31:52.483
Do I know you?

31:52.702 --> 31:54.488
Is this man bothering you, Miss Hedison?

31:55.455 --> 31:58.163
Men never bother me, Marco.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.493
Pick me up in half an hour,
I have to be at the Hunt Club.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.328
I'm going riding with Dr. Kirkwood.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.216
Wait!

32:24.276 --> 32:27.268
What's the rush? Where am I running?

32:34.035 --> 32:36.993
Really, Paul, it's not exactly murder.

32:37.539 --> 32:40.702
No. It's out of the question.
I won't even discuss it.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.456
But you're his doctor. Surely you
could increase Blake's medication.

32:44.546 --> 32:48.540
It's an experimental drug.
It could have terrible side effects.

32:48.592 --> 32:52.130
I'm sure Blake would try anything
to get rid of those migraines.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.882
But even if Blake were out of the way,

32:54.973 --> 32:58.841
your father will never leave
the company to you. What about Ty?

32:58.894 --> 33:03.354
- I can always handle Ty.
- Rachel, I'm a medical doctor!

33:03.398 --> 33:05.890
I can't do it!

33:06.485 --> 33:10.353
You don't need your father's company.
We have each other.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.272
Let's get married as we planned.

33:13.366 --> 33:17.735
I'm sorry, Paul, but I don't think
I'm ready for marriage yet.

33:24.252 --> 33:28.166
All right.
I'll increase Blake's medication.

33:32.135 --> 33:35.594
Come on. I'll race you
to Winchester Cathedral.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.606
Yeah.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.525
Should be slow.

33:53.114 --> 33:56.152
I'll make Rachel beg for me.

33:56.243 --> 33:59.110
Let her suffer a little.

33:59.204 --> 34:03.698
Let's see. She's going horseback riding
this afternoon, so I'll...

34:04.417 --> 34:06.454
Horseback riding.

34:07.546 --> 34:13.007
Horseback riding. Oh, my God. Fetterman
and the Sherwoods, they're gonna kill her!

34:14.636 --> 34:20.348
And so no money had changed hands and
the cow was returned to its rightful owner.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.300
That was told to me by a...

34:31.820 --> 34:33.902
Stop! 0h, my God!

35:26.124 --> 35:27.740
Whoops! Sorry.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.404
Easy.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.955
Big fella. Settle down, now.

36:11.086 --> 36:16.752
- I believe you dropped your hat.
- Thank you. You saved my life!

36:19.636 --> 36:22.128
- Haven't we met?
- Perhaps.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.759
And perhaps we'll meet again.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.993
She's dyin' for me. I love this.

36:52.752 --> 36:56.336
Come on, slow down, will you?
Don't do that. Easy, boy.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.583
Why didn't I write myself
back to the stable? Easy!

37:01.136 --> 37:04.970
Oh, please. Slow down.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.305
Hi!

37:08.309 --> 37:10.892
Oh, my God! Jesus!

37:10.979 --> 37:14.142
- Help! Somebody help!
- Oh, my gosh!

37:14.607 --> 37:16.473
9h, my God! Help!

37:32.959 --> 37:34.996
Help me!

37:39.090 --> 37:43.425
Hey, help! Please, lady! Help me!

37:43.553 --> 37:45.385
Whoa! Help!

37:47.474 --> 37:48.555
Oh, no!

37:57.859 --> 38:00.191
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.361
Yeah, I think so. Thanks.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.444
Yeah. What's this?

38:06.534 --> 38:09.617
- Oh, no! You picked up a sickle thorn.
- What?

38:09.704 --> 38:12.287
- Bend over a little.
- Wait. Is it gonna hurt?

38:12.373 --> 38:16.492
- It might hurt.
- No, forget it. Just leave it in. OK.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.711
God!

38:19.756 --> 38:22.999
Look at the size of that! Wow!

38:27.055 --> 38:31.515
- I used to come here as a kid.
- Oh, it's beautiful. It really is.

38:32.227 --> 38:35.936
So, Janet, just out of curiosity,

38:36.064 --> 38:38.772
tell me more about
your character - yourself.

38:38.858 --> 38:43.728
There's not that much to tell. I got my PhD
at Ashford Falls Christian Normal.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.405
- Good school.
- Then I went to Africa.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.862
Africa? Where did that come from?

38:50.245 --> 38:53.454
For the last two years
I've lived there with a colony of ants.

38:53.581 --> 38:57.370
- You lived with ants?
- I do research. I chart everything they do.

38:57.418 --> 39:00.752
Social organization,
their movement, their mating habits.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.048
Oh, I see. Like one of those
National Geographic specials.

39:04.092 --> 39:08.131
No, I'll never be on one of those.
My friend Manu says I'm not big enough.

39:08.221 --> 39:13.261
I don't have gorillas like Dian Fossey or
Jane Goodall with her precious chimps.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.139
- Right.
- See, no one cares about ants,

39:16.229 --> 39:20.644
but once you live with them, you see
their specialness, their individuality.

39:20.733 --> 39:24.351
It's as though each one
has a personality all their own.

39:24.445 --> 39:25.981
Really?

39:27.490 --> 39:30.152
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

39:33.788 --> 39:39.955
Rachel, you know we don't discuss
financial matters at the dinner table.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.502
Father, I have the right
to know what's going on.

39:42.589 --> 39:46.628
I will not be shut out of the business
by you or anyone else.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.473
Yes, Ty?

39:59.188 --> 40:02.306
When are you going to stop
this madness with Rachel?

40:02.400 --> 40:05.938
- Nothing happened at the Mardi Gras.
- She's your sister!

40:05.987 --> 40:09.230
All right, Rachel.
We are working on something.

40:09.324 --> 40:12.191
How would you like to eat
whatever you want,

40:12.285 --> 40:14.777
then take a pill
that speeds up your metabolism,

40:14.829 --> 40:18.163
burning off all the sugar and fat?

40:18.666 --> 40:21.203
We have a pill like that?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.418
My God, I'll make a fortune!

40:24.672 --> 40:28.336
Or lose everything
if someone beats us to the market.

40:28.927 --> 40:34.093
It's possible that Fletcher Dubois
figured out the Meta Pill ahead of us.

40:34.182 --> 40:36.173
That's what Jack Gates is after.

40:36.267 --> 40:40.386
But I don't understand why he wants to
get his hand up your dress. I mean...

40:40.480 --> 40:42.687
We all know what you meant, Ty.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.607
Watch it, Blake, or I'll give you
a headache you won't forget.

40:45.693 --> 40:49.687
- You lay one finger on him, Ty...
- Always protecting Blake, Daddy!

40:49.781 --> 40:52.523
Sometimes I wish I wasn't your son.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.442
If I am your son.

40:57.246 --> 41:01.410
- How are your headaches, Blake?
- Oh, much better.

41:01.501 --> 41:04.664
Paul doubled my dosage.
It seems to be working.

41:04.712 --> 41:08.125
That's not the drug
we're still testing, is it?

41:09.217 --> 41:12.050
Paul feels it's completely safe, Father.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.924
Leave it all to me, Dad.

41:15.014 --> 41:19.383
I'll figure out just how far
Fletcher Dubois got with his formula.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.771
That's strange.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.516
My gums are bleeding.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.410
"With tears in her eyes,
Rachel runs to him."

41:38.746 --> 41:40.987
Too corny!

41:45.086 --> 41:47.123
- Hello.
- It's Janet.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.296
- Where are you?
- I'm in my father's lab, what's left of it.

41:50.425 --> 41:55.135
What a jerk I was! I can't believe it! No
wonder you didn't wanna buy the formula!

41:55.430 --> 41:58.263
- You were gonna steal it all along.
- What?

41:58.516 --> 42:00.928
You're working for the Hedisons,
aren't you?

42:01.019 --> 42:05.263
- What?
- Well, I'll burn it before they ever get it!

42:08.192 --> 42:10.433
I think your friends are still here.

42:11.112 --> 42:14.855
- What friends?
- Well, they're gonna be sorry.

42:15.575 --> 42:19.910
Janet, if there's someone there, get
outta the house right now. Call the police!

42:19.954 --> 42:22.696
I swear, I had nothing to do with this!

42:23.291 --> 42:25.749
Janet? Hello?

42:25.793 --> 42:28.205
Hello, Janet?

42:38.556 --> 42:40.968
Hello? Janet?

42:45.188 --> 42:48.146
Jesus! I didn't write any of this.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.726
Of course. It's Fetterman again!

42:53.529 --> 42:57.614
OK, you two-bit hack.
Now we're gonna play some hardball.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.240
Interior. Dubois lab.

43:04.332 --> 43:07.825
All you have to do is show us your
father's notes and we'll be on our way.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.915
I'm telling you, he never even
figured out that formula!

43:11.130 --> 43:12.165
We'll see about that.

43:17.804 --> 43:19.135
Give yourself a break, lady.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.508
Where did that window come from?

43:29.315 --> 43:30.851
Jack!

43:53.881 --> 43:55.747
9h. my gosh!

43:59.762 --> 44:02.220
What are you gonna do
about this, smart guy?

44:07.311 --> 44:09.268
Jack, watch out!

44:12.733 --> 44:15.475
When did you start carrying a knife?

44:16.445 --> 44:18.607
Let's get outta here. Come on.

44:20.408 --> 44:23.776
- I've never seen anything like that!
- Neither has anyone else.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.573
Boy, these guys sure know
how to tie a knot.

44:29.959 --> 44:34.374
- Hey, what's this?
- What they wanted. My father's formula.

44:34.422 --> 44:37.255
I think it'll be safer in your hands,
Mr. Gates.

44:37.300 --> 44:40.588
Look, lady, for the last time,
the name is not...

44:40.636 --> 44:44.595
He's a master at martial arts,
he's powerful and ruthless.

44:44.682 --> 44:47.014
Who else could you be?

44:47.101 --> 44:49.968
This could work for me.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.269
Powerful, ruthless.

44:52.315 --> 44:55.023
Yes! I am Jack Gates!

44:55.109 --> 44:59.319
- Then you'll buy my father's formula?
- Of course. Come on!

45:00.698 --> 45:03.440
It'd be easier if you pulled out again.

45:03.492 --> 45:07.281
- Don't tell me how to park.
- There's a really big space over there.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.908
- Do you wanna drive?
- No.

45:15.963 --> 45:19.126
OK, we're fine. Here we go, now. Yep.

45:20.468 --> 45:24.382
Oh, yeah. This is fine.
It's a lot closer than I thought.

45:26.015 --> 45:28.302
- You OK there?
- Oh, yeah.

45:41.072 --> 45:42.107
She's beautiful, isn't she?

45:43.074 --> 45:44.235
Beautiful.

45:44.909 --> 45:48.152
- I went to high school with Rachel.
- Oh, yeah?

45:48.204 --> 45:51.162
- What was she like?
- Rich, pretty.

45:52.667 --> 45:55.785
She was homecoming queen
all four years.

45:57.463 --> 46:01.673
I remember once she wore
this beautiful white lace dress

46:01.717 --> 46:04.004
and this gorgeous crown.

46:04.887 --> 46:08.005
When she came down that stairway,

46:08.891 --> 46:12.009
it was as if she were floating.

46:13.437 --> 46:16.179
I wanted to be Rachel that night.

46:20.528 --> 46:24.692
- When did this place open?
- Oh, a couple of hours ago.

46:26.993 --> 46:30.111
And I hear they serve
a very good pastrami.

46:37.545 --> 46:39.206
Pick-up!

46:39.547 --> 46:42.209
Pastrami on a kaiser and...

46:43.384 --> 46:47.719
Lox and cream cheese
on cinnamon toast? Get it outta here!

46:48.931 --> 46:52.799
Yeah, you're right.
It gets really lonely out there.

46:52.893 --> 46:57.228
Sometimes Manu and I are alone
in the bush for months at a time.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.931
Thank you.

47:00.276 --> 47:03.268
So are you tellin' me
you never met anyone out there?

47:03.362 --> 47:06.900
I did get involved with a Frenchman.
He said he was an environmentalist.

47:07.158 --> 47:09.991
- Turns out he wasn't.
- What was he?

47:10.077 --> 47:12.444
A poacher. They hung him.

47:12.580 --> 47:15.789
God, I always choose the wrong guys.

47:15.875 --> 47:19.084
Not me. I always choose the right women.

47:19.128 --> 47:21.745
I just can't get 'em
to go out with me, that's all.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.957
But you're Jack Gates.
You can have anyone you want.

47:25.051 --> 47:29.261
Of course! I meant before
I became ruthless and powerful.

47:36.103 --> 47:40.768
So, maybe you'd like to come over
sometime. I'm really a pretty good cook.

47:42.777 --> 47:45.144
- You don't wanna come.
- I didn't say that.

47:45.237 --> 47:50.107
I understand. You're a busy person.
You've got hostile takeovers to take over.

47:50.159 --> 47:53.151
- I understand.
- Do you want me to come over or not?

47:53.287 --> 47:55.654
- Yes, definitely.
- I'd love to.

47:56.957 --> 47:59.619
I guess this is why I live with ants.

48:01.754 --> 48:04.667
Lox, cream cheese, on cinnamon toast?

48:05.549 --> 48:08.166
- And you're actually eating that?
- Yeah.

48:08.302 --> 48:10.009
Amazing.

48:11.389 --> 48:14.632
The next item up
is this lovely Amish quilt.

48:14.683 --> 48:18.517
Not since Betsy Ross has there been
such exquisite workmanship.

48:18.604 --> 48:20.720
Who Will offer $30?

48:20.815 --> 48:23.432
$35. Do I hear 40?

48:23.484 --> 48:25.851
Daddy, we're never going to
reach our goal.

48:25.945 --> 48:29.028
Rachel, I'm not buying
any more of this crap.

48:33.828 --> 48:39.494
I've been getting these hot flashes. Do you
think I should cut back on the medicine?

48:41.419 --> 48:44.332
Those gums don't look tiptop either.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.997
Maybe you'd better stop. Just...

48:49.927 --> 48:53.921
It's probably just allergies.
Stay on this dosage another week.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.138
Good.

49:19.665 --> 49:24.205
I hope I'm not interrupting, ladies
and gentlemen. My name is Jack Gates.

49:24.420 --> 49:27.663
- You see? I told you it was Jack Gates.
- Be quiet.

49:27.715 --> 49:31.709
- You were right, Blake.
- What do you mean, he was right?

49:31.760 --> 49:34.878
It was me, Daddy! Me! I'm the one!

49:36.640 --> 49:40.759
I'm just a visitor to Ashford Falls,
but I believe in a good cause.

49:40.895 --> 49:45.184
Therefore I'm donating
my Ferrari to your auction.

49:46.859 --> 49:51.069
- He certainly has style.
- Yeah. If you like a showboat.

49:51.155 --> 49:56.901
We would like to thank Mr. Gates for his
very generous donation of this classic.

50:01.749 --> 50:05.208
The bidding will begin at $500,000.

50:06.045 --> 50:09.413
It's the most beautiful car I've ever seen.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.007
Do you want it?

50:16.430 --> 50:19.798
$500,000. Thank you, Dr. Kirkwood.

50:20.559 --> 50:23.768
Do I see 550? 550. Thank you, madam.

50:23.854 --> 50:27.518
600? 600. Thank you, sir.

50:27.942 --> 50:30.479
$700,000.

50:30.569 --> 50:34.984
$700,000. Thank you, Dr. Kirkwood.

50:35.115 --> 50:37.482
$700,000, going once.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.609
$700,000, going twice.

50:39.870 --> 50:42.111
$850,000.

50:43.207 --> 50:45.118
My God!

50:45.209 --> 50:47.826
He's bidding on his own car!

50:48.796 --> 50:52.130
$900,000.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.844
One million dollars.

51:02.560 --> 51:06.349
Sold! One million dollars!

51:07.648 --> 51:09.855
To the original owner.

51:16.448 --> 51:18.860
Rachel, I...

51:27.001 --> 51:31.541
So, the mysterious stranger
rides to the rescue again.

51:31.630 --> 51:34.839
Madam, this stranger knows no danger.

51:35.509 --> 51:38.501
I am much stranger than you think.

51:54.528 --> 51:57.566
Miss Hedison,
may I drop you somewhere?

51:57.698 --> 52:00.190
That's all right. I'll take her.

52:00.242 --> 52:02.358
Oh? Do you think you'll have time?

52:05.414 --> 52:07.030
Oh, my God.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.289
I'm supposed to be in surgery.

52:18.093 --> 52:19.675
May I?

52:23.599 --> 52:26.637
I'll take Rachel
where she's going, Mr. Gates.

52:26.727 --> 52:30.516
- Oh, really? I don't think so.
- Your car phone, sir.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.975
Maybe you could use a lift after all.

52:36.070 --> 52:40.064
Mr. Gates, are you aware that
I'm engaged to Dr. Kirkwood?

52:40.324 --> 52:44.067
- Wouldn't you rather be in love?
- I'm sorry, Rachel.

52:44.161 --> 52:48.325
- I can't take you. I've got to get home.
- What is it, Daddy? ls something wrong?

52:48.415 --> 52:53.376
- The cable TV man is coming.
- But the stockholders' meeting.

52:53.420 --> 52:57.084
You know how hard it is
getting those guys to come out.

52:57.132 --> 53:00.921
I've got black bars on <i>2</i> and 7.

53:01.970 --> 53:05.179
- Rachel, Blake'll take you to the club.
- I can't.

53:05.265 --> 53:09.725
- I've got to get my wheels balanced.
- Now? Why do you have to do that now?

53:09.770 --> 53:14.515
- I don't know!
- What the hell is going on around here?

53:20.572 --> 53:26.113
Your grandstand play at the auction,
Mr. Gates. What are you really up to?

53:26.161 --> 53:30.120
- You don't trust me, do you?
- No more than you trust me.

53:40.968 --> 53:45.678
- Let's play a little game.
- What kind of game?

53:46.306 --> 53:48.388
It's called Trust.

53:49.935 --> 53:52.347
Oh, this is so silly!

53:53.063 --> 53:56.021
All right. How do you play?

53:56.150 --> 53:57.481
Simple.

53:57.526 --> 54:00.359
I place my life in your hands.

54:07.578 --> 54:10.991
- Are you crazy?
- Come on, Rachel, what do I do?

54:11.039 --> 54:14.282
- Please stop!
- Why? I trust you.

54:15.127 --> 54:18.245
Go to the right! Oh, my God!
Look out on the left!

54:19.882 --> 54:23.841
No, right! To the right!

54:38.400 --> 54:40.437
Turn at the truck!

54:50.579 --> 54:52.866
Don't! You'll never make it!

54:56.126 --> 54:59.039
I'm begging you, stop the car!

54:59.254 --> 55:01.871
- Do you really want me to stop?
- Yes!

55:01.924 --> 55:04.416
I thought you could take this.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.505
Don't stop, then. Faster!

55:12.309 --> 55:14.721
Sharp curve to the right.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.394
Steady.

55:18.607 --> 55:20.974
Don't lose it now.

55:21.777 --> 55:23.108
Yes!

55:23.195 --> 55:25.311
Yes! Harder!

55:26.365 --> 55:28.402
Oh, this is wonderful!

55:36.124 --> 55:38.331
Nice day for a drive, isn't it?

55:40.671 --> 55:44.665
How long am I supposed to
wait for these cable people?

55:44.758 --> 55:47.921
Who cares about
the black bar on your TV?

55:48.846 --> 55:53.181
What about Rachel?
She's with Gates. Isn't she?

55:53.767 --> 55:58.227
See? It's definitely the cable.
Look at the difference. Cable, antenna.

55:58.272 --> 56:00.309
- Cable, antenna.
- Daddy!

56:01.358 --> 56:02.940
Dad! Daddy!

56:03.151 --> 56:07.691
- I've got terrible news.
- The cable man's not coming, is he?

56:08.073 --> 56:11.987
I went through Gates' stuff at his hotel.
He's got a deal to buy the formula.

56:12.119 --> 56:14.030
So Dubois came up with the Meta Pill!

56:14.997 --> 56:17.113
- That does it.
- No, there's more.

56:17.165 --> 56:20.874
Gates has all these crazy notes.
He knows everything about us.

56:20.961 --> 56:26.456
He knows about our phony drug test,
your brain tumour, and even my... My...

56:26.508 --> 56:28.499
Amnesia!

56:28.594 --> 56:33.589
What does that man want?
Is he out to break us or to see us in jail?

56:33.640 --> 56:37.725
If I can't have Rachel,
I don't care about jail!

56:38.854 --> 56:41.812
And I hope your cable man
never shows up!

56:44.568 --> 56:46.980
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, Paul.

56:50.324 --> 56:53.862
Dad, I did good. Right, Daddy?

56:54.411 --> 56:57.654
Yes, you did. I'm very proud of you.

56:58.665 --> 57:00.656
Good job, son.

57:01.543 --> 57:03.329
Blake, I'm glad you're here.

57:03.587 --> 57:07.421
Ty, fill him in.
Blake will know what to do about Gates.

57:09.843 --> 57:11.425
Dad!

57:12.512 --> 57:16.380
You can't keep doing this to me!

57:18.602 --> 57:21.890
No! Ty! That's a Tang dynasty!

57:26.818 --> 57:30.982
You can't even do that right,
can you, son?

57:37.120 --> 57:39.532
So he's a little late.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.160
Maybe he stopped for wine.

57:42.209 --> 57:45.452
Or flowers. Oh, God,
it could've been flowers.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.371
Or maybe he's just late.

58:06.900 --> 58:09.392
- Yes?
- Where were you?

58:09.945 --> 58:11.527
What?

58:11.989 --> 58:14.481
You were supposed to meet me.

58:18.870 --> 58:21.737
I'm Jack Gates.

58:26.128 --> 58:30.122
Next time I'll write myself
an automatic transmission.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.056
- Good evening.
- Evening, sir.

59:02.664 --> 59:05.326
Janet! What are you doing here?

59:05.625 --> 59:08.868
Look, about the dinner. I can explain.

59:09.129 --> 59:13.965
- Are you really Jack Gates?
- Of course I'm Jack Gates!

59:14.634 --> 59:16.671
That's funny.

59:18.972 --> 59:22.306
All my life, I've been Jack Gates.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.600
Robert Wagner!

59:26.438 --> 59:30.397
What are you doing in this part?
You don't do daytime TV!

59:30.484 --> 59:34.773
Of course! The Shervvoods hired
Robert Wagner! It's Sweeps Week!

59:35.781 --> 59:38.614
Robert Wagner! Wow!

59:38.992 --> 59:43.202
This nebbish has been masquerading
as me, and you believed him?

59:43.288 --> 59:47.452
I should have known.
I mean, gosh, the way he parked the car!

59:48.376 --> 59:52.119
- This belongs to you, Mr. Gates.
- Thank you, my dear.

59:54.132 --> 59:56.089
Look out!

59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.804
They're tryin' to kill me!
Goddamn you, Fetterman!

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.673
Oh, my God!

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:09.678
It's real blood.

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:13.057
He's dead! It can't be!

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.313
He's Robert Wagner!

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.361
I can't let him die.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:21.611
I gotta bring him back.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:30.032
Don't worry, Mr. Wagner,
everything's gonna be fine.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.168
He even looks good dead.

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:40.046
Jack's hotel room.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.303
This has gotta work.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.558
I did it! It worked!

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.895
I brought him back! How're you feelin'?

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.029
A little dizzy.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:09.156
- I don't understand what happened.
- You don't have to. Goodbye, Mr. Gates.

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:12.787
"Goodbye Mr. Gates," he said.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:22.043
- Get me a cab! I've gotta go to the airport.
- But you just checked in.

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:25.213
I don't care! I gotta go to...

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.308
Cleveland.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:32.686
Jesus! I hate Cleveland!

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:40.061
You don't belong in Ashford Falls.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:45.115
You're really a sweet kid.
You'll be a lot happier back in Africa.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.283
Exterior.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.123
Jungle clearing.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.584
Night.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:59.376
No. Must be day over there.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:05.799
Goodbye, Janet. Have fun with your ants.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:17.181
He's supposed to be
this ruthless tycoon.

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:22.403
- But he seemed like a nice guy to me.
- Sounds like the poacher again.

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:26.232
You should've seen the way
he rode a horse. Oh, it was so cute!

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:30.118
By the way, I nearly forgot.
This telegram came for you this morning.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:32.989
A telegram for me? Wow!

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:37.334
Do you think it's from Jack?
Oh, I bet it's from Jack!

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:42.877
It's from Carter Hedison.
"A matter of life and death."

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:50.889
You can't just toss me aside, Paul.
Don't you see? Rachel's just using you.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:54.765
She uses men the way
other women use cotton balls!

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.141
- It's over, Helen.
- Paul!

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:05.233
You've won again, Rachel.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.987
But for the last time.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:20.120
Paul, you're being childish.
Jack Gates doesn't mean anything to me.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:24.708
- I wish you'd trust me.
- I do. It's just...

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.881
Then prove it.

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.555
Let's play a little game.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.569
Please, miss.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:51.905
Almost killed with
the engaging thoracic surgeon

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:56.072
was his philanthropist
socialite fiancée, Rachel Hedison,

01:03:56.166 --> 01:04:01.206
daughter of industrialist and well-known
socialist... Socialite, Carter Hedison.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:07.083
From Ashford Falls Falls, this is your
Ashford Falls reporter, Debbie Norden.

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:09.801
I had to be a big shot!

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:12.596
I almost killed the woman I love!

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.764
It's all my fault!

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.844
No, it isn't. No, it isn't!

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.605
I can only control what I write, right?

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:23.390
Right!

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.651
No, it's my fault.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:35.111
Who's that?
I didn't write that. Who wrote that?

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:43.206
- Hello?
- Hi. I'm glad I caught you in.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.330
Hi!

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.668
My father's throwing a party
this weekend and he wants you to come.

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:54.881
- Oh, I'd be delighted.
- Jack, I can't talk long.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:59.969
Your life is in danger. My father
will stop at nothing to get the formula.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:03.931
Bring it to me.
It's the last place my father will look.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.475
You really care for me, don't you?

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:11.314
Of course I do. That's why
I didn't want you to come to the party.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:16.493
My father's announcing
my engagement to Paul.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:19.697
Oh, why did you have to
come into my life now?

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:23.159
Goodbye, my darling.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:26.377
"My darling."

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:34.507
- He'll be there.
- What about the formula?

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:39.342
- He'll have it.
- Yes, but will we?

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:47.024
Good point, Blake.
ls there something going on, Rachel?

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:50.356
It's never taken you this long
to get what you want from a man.

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.859
I don't know what it is.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:57.159
When I'm with him, it's as if
I don't have a mind of my own.

01:05:57.245 --> 01:06:01.159
He has this strange power over me.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.875
Exterior.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:07.703
Hedison...

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.120
Mouse.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:12.041
Not mouse. House!

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.217
Watch the typos.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.182
I'm gonna be incredible this weekend.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:27.640
This time it's comin' straight
from the heart. No blindfolds.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.520
No trickery.

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:32.607
No flashy stunts. No.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.109
I gotta be me!

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.794
Is he gonna play all night?

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.678
- Miss Dubois!
- Hello, Edward.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:00.802
- Hello!
- Is Mr. Hedison here?

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:02.974
Oh, yes. Do please go in.

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:12.101
Janet! What are you doing here?

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:15.278
What's going on, Ty?
Why does your father want to see me?

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:19.317
Golly, I've missed you. Remember the
time I was gonna ask you to the prom?

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:23.946
- And your father wouldn't let you.
- No, that's not true.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:29.001
That was the time that I got...
I got...

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.953
- Amnesia, sir.
- Remember?

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:42.927
I thought you were announcing
our engagement.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:46.472
- Why did you ask him to play the piano?
- I didn't.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.227
I didn't ask him to sing
"Send In The Clowns", either.

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:54.142
Paul. Hi.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.318
Excuse me, sir.

01:07:58.366 --> 01:08:01.404
Miss Janet Dubois is in your study.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.825
Oh, my God.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.836
Water, no ice.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:17.040
You were the first one
to drink a lot of water.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.171
Now everybody's doing it.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:25.140
So, Janet, while you're here,
maybe we could go horseback riding.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:28.267
- I don't think so.
- Well!

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.434
Janet Dubois. How grown-up we are.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.937
What's going on?
What's all this about life and death?

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:38.145
We can discuss it later.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:43.359
Ty, show Janet to one of the guest rooms.
She can wear some of Rachel's clothes.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:48.368
- You can have my room, Janet.
- You're not gonna be in it, are you?

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:54.252
I didn't send that wire.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.671
But if you didn't,

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.587
then who did?

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:14.479
Encore!

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:20.233
Thank you very much.
You're wonderful. For me? Thank you!

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.910
- You brought tears to my eyes.
- I know.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.783
Oh, Jack!

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:37.250
- Donna? Donna McKenzie, Lincoln High?
- Yeah!

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.379
I couldn't have been that drunk.
What else did I write last night?

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.004
You were wonderful!

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.428
All those years,
your locker was right next to mine

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.557
- and I never even talked to you.
- I know.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:57.816
How could I ever have been
in love with Greg Petula? Barf!

01:09:57.902 --> 01:09:58.937
Barf!

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:01.478
I was wrong about you.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.439
- You're not a jerk.
- Oh, thanks.

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:09.328
Lincoln High!
Gimme an I, gimme an I! Lincoln High!

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.991
I just want you to know
how much I enjoyed your playing.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.167
Oh, thank you.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.671
The elderly man exits.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:23.463
Great! Now I got 'em
talkin' stage directions!

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.053
What is going on around here?

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:31.470
- The bartender needs more cold deer.
- Not deer!

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:36.521
Beer! It's a typo!
Use your head, for Christ's sake!

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.983
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:48.150
- My God, he's choking to death!
- I'll handle this.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:51.411
- You've got it backwards!
- What are you doing?

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:55.206
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Heimlich maneuver.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.837
- You'll be fine now.
- You saved my life!

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.665
I know.

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.339
Is there nothing you can't do?

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:15.093
Excuse us.
Thank you very much. Excuse us.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:17.270
Paul doesn't know the Heimlich?

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:21.771
Well, of course I know the Heimlich.
I know the Heimlich!

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:25.525
Jim, you know I know the Heimlich.
Look, I love the Heimlich!

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:29.032
I'm always doing the Heimlich.
It's one of my favorite maneuvers!

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:31.534
I'm a medical doctor!

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.668
I want you, Jack.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.129
And you shall have me.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:41.604
I don't know why I'm so thirsty.

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:45.771
Mr. Hedison. Blake.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:49.237
I see you're still under
Dr. Kirkwood's care.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:53.942
What are you up to, Helen?
I don't recall inviting you to this party.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:57.200
Wouldn't you like to find out
why you sent for Janet Dubois?

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:05.838
As Jack pilots his private jet to New York,
Rachel nibbles on his ear...

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:09.049
Her long, supple legs

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:12.127
wrapped sensuously around...

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.889
What am I doing?

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:20.138
I'm like a junkie with this thing!

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.687
I hate you!

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:29.819
Oh, my God, what did I do?

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:34.275
I'm not marrying Paul.
I'm going to call off the engagement.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:36.450
Later, Rachel.

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:40.572
All right, Helen. What is going on?

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.962
I had no idea. She's stunning.

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:09.184
What's she doin' back here?

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:21.621
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:26.202
I guess this is why
I was never homecoming queen.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.878
I think you look beautiful.

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:38.805
Do you hear bells?

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.598
Yes.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.933
Dinner is served.

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.270
Let me help you up. Here we go.

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.398
- Thanks.
- OK.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.655
Rachel! You know Janet.

01:14:56.367 --> 01:15:00.281
- Janet! How are your cockroaches?
- Ants! It's ants!

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:04.907
Jack, the hell with my father. Let's leave
tonight. I'll just pack a few things.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.583
Right.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:13.089
I left in such a rush.
We still have a deal, don't we?

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:16.502
Sure we do.
I've got the formula right here.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:19.094
I've got it right in my...

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:22.515
- Actually, I gave it to Rachel.
- You what?

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.514
- Just for a moment.
- Of all the people to give it to!

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:28.767
- It's not what you think.
- It is what I think.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:33.481
- Jack, I trusted you.
- Janet, I'd like to see you in the library.

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:36.063
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Grates.

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:41.534
- Janet!
- How could you have done this to me?

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.199
- I believed in you!
- But, Janet...

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.791
Not Grates, it's Gates.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:52.378
Excuse me, sir, dinner is...

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:55.002
Are you all right, sir?
Can I get you something?

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.834
Yeah. How about a new typewriter?

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:02.969
- You can't be my father!
- It's true, Janet.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:06.351
When my mother was head nurse
at Ashford Falls Community General,

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:11.648
she accidentally switched
you and Rachel when you were born.

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:16.523
Oh, I can't be a Hedison.
I hate the Hedisons!

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:20.406
I'm sorry, Janet, but it's time it came out.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:26.238
It's time Rachel learned that
she's not a high-and-mighty Hedison.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:30.371
That she can't just take
what belongs to other people.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:32.498
Paul is mine!

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:39.588
I'm glad that you're all here.
Especially you, Janet.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:41.715
Dad, you're not gonna stop me this time.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:46.516
I realized tonight that I'm still in love
with Janet, and that I always will be!

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:50.061
Of course you're in love with her!
She's your sister!

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:57.353
- Rachel, are you ready to...
- How about these?

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:01.239
No, no, Marie.
Flats with that dress? Are you crazy?

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:04.534
I thought you were
just taking a few things!

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.281
Are we going or not?

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:10.414
They're right about me.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.708
I am weak!

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:18.043
I don't have Rachel.
I don't even have my self-respect.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:25.714
I have nothing to live for!

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.935
- Jesus Christ, you almost killed me!
- Water!

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:46.196
Oh, my God! Look what I've done to you!

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:49.029
Forgive me, Blake! Forgive me!

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:53.245
It was Rachel! Rachel made me do it!

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.752
Rachel.

01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:59.164
That slut did this?

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.166
Yes.

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:07.259
- Oh, no!
- What is it now?

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.346
- I forgot my shoulder pads.
- Who gives a shit?

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:17.311
Daddy, don't try to stop me.
I'm going to New York with Jack Gates.

01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:21.611
I think there's something you should
know. This is going to come as a shook,

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.109
but you are not a Hedison.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:30.828
- Janet is my real daughter.
- Oh, for Chrissakes, that is the corniest!

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.616
It's Fetterman. He's goin' for
that baby-switching crap.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:37.289
This can't be true.

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:40.292
Oh, but it is.

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:43.295
Little Miss Tummy Tuck.

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:54.098
This house is mine now.
So pick up your bags and keep moving.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:58.481
- Bitch.
- Look, you little anteater...

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:02.610
- Janet, what are they doing to you?
- By the way, our deal's off, Gates.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:06.773
The formula stays in the family
and I get... 80 per cent.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:10.488
She's a Hedison all right!

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.991
Hold it.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:16.825
Now I get it. They're bringin' you
into the story to replace Rachel!

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:21.083
- Stay out of this, Jack.
- No! It's wrong! You're not like that!

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:25.292
Fetterman's trying to change you
and I won't let him do it!

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:28.803
Paul told me all about it, sister!

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:32.431
Well, if I'm gonna die,

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:34.930
I'm gonna shoot you first!

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:37.099
Gimme that!

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:42.733
Janefl

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:47.321
Oh, shit!

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:51.492
Paul! Do something!
Janet's been shot! Edward, help him.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.199
I will call the paramedics.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.743
- She's wearing my shoes.
- Will you shut the hell up?

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:03.705
- Can you stop the bleeding?
- Yes, stop the bleeding.

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:06.249
She's ruining the parquet floor!

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:11.884
You want bleeding? Huh? I'll show you
bleedin'. You want bleedin', huh?

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:15.550
Is that what you want?
'Cause I'll give you some bleedin'!

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.726
Let me at her! Let me at her!

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:27.903
Whoever you are...

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.906
Promise me...

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:34.281
That you'll be there when I wake up.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.157
I promise.

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:40.583
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I'm not gonna lose you now.

01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:04.436
She's not gonna take away what's mine.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.767
What's ours.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.779
Just make sure Janet
doesn't survive that operation.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:30.713
But don't you see? If Janet is my sister,
then I still have a chance with Rachel!

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:34.637
- I'll make sure he's well taken care of!
- Don't bother.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:37.013
Hurry! Every second counts!
We've got to...

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:40.726
Good Lord.

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:46.015
I can't leave now. Go on. Go on.

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:52.105
- Where the hell have you been?
- How ya doin'?

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:57.698
I'll tell you how I'm doing. I've got
a black bar on 2 and 7. It's in the study.

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:13.171
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about me.

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:16.462
It's Janet!

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:19.891
Rachel is gonna make Paul kill Janet!

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.557
She'll never get outta surgery alive!

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.318
Are you ready, darling?

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:39.993
How am I gonna do this?

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:45.124
Look, I told you.
It's shaped like a little boot!

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.247
I don't have time to come over there!

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:51.543
Just be quiet and listen
to every word I say.

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:54.842
That little boot goes to your spacer.

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:09.223
Now comes the tough part.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:13.437
There are three holes
in that little black bar.

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:17.027
- I see them!
- The one in the middle is a large one.

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:20.944
Attach the spring
to the hole in the middle.

01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:22.654
But...

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:26.537
Don't touch the roller next to it.
Repeat: do not touch the roller!

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.914
This is delicate work, you moron!

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.961
Stop yellin'! You're makin' me nervous!

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:40.011
OK, I've got the spring on.

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:43.557
Oh, shit, it's off again.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.611
It's working! It's working! I did it!

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:03.369
OK, OK. So you did it. Who cares?

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:29.182
- Where's the formula, my friend?
- What are you doing here?

01:24:29.439 --> 01:24:33.023
- I sent you to Cleveland!
- I should kill you for that alone.

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:37.399
- I want that formula.
- Go do a mini-series or something!

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:42.317
Interior. Hospital operating room.

01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:51.000
Nobody crosses Jack Gates.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:54.662
Fine! "Nobody crosses Jack Gates."
Great line.

01:24:56.174 --> 01:25:01.169
Janet has a miraculous recovery.
As her eyes begin to flutter...

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:15.479
Oh, you poor darling!

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:17.894
Just take it easy, Jack.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:22.190
- Stay away from me!
- You're gonna be all right.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:26.027
Get your hands off me,
you two-bit quack! Where's Janet?

01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:29.071
- If anything happens to her, I'll...
- It's all right!

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:33.751
You expect me to believe you? I know
what you're up to, you goddamn bitch!

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:35.373
Jack!

01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:37.880
All you ever think of is yourself.
You're sick!

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:42.464
- How dare you talk to me like that?
- What did you do with Janet?

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:47.014
Jack? You OK?
Somebody said you got hit by a truck.

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:50.142
- Trunk!
- He got hit by luggage?

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:04.398
Yes.

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:08.911
Yeah. You see, the trunk lid
popped open and hit me in the chin.

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:12.911
It's all right, Jack.
You must've been really out of it.

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:16.077
I know you would never
talk to me that way.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.253
Not my Jack!

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:21.169
I was so worried about you!

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.250
Of course!

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:26.671
I know your concern for others
eats you up inside.

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:30.383
Good Lord, look what I've done to you.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:32.597
You need a rest.

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:34.850
You gotta get away!

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:40.276
Don't you worry. I'm gonna arrange for
you to take some time off from the show.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.614
How much time?

01:26:47.577 --> 01:26:49.659
Oh, my God!

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:54.949
- You're going to give me a brain tumour!
- I've gotta go find Janet.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:58.495
Jack! We have to talk!

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:01.167
Jack?

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:03.040
Jack!

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:06.461
Anybody want a refrigerator?

01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:12.558
Marge, there was a girl here who...

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:48.594
- What's goin' on here, Marge?
- Callbacks for Janet.

01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:53.765
More passion?

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.283
Sorry. Sorry.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:20.376
I saw the girls you called in for Janet.
You're making a big mistake.

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:23.545
- She's not glitzy or glamorous.
- She won't be!

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.591
She'll come in wholesome and innocent,
as a contrast to the evil Hedisons.

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:30.506
Oh, I see. I see. Yeah.

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:33.889
First you set her up,
then you change her, right?

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:39.684
Well, we don't have to do it that way.
Where did you hear all this?

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:42.189
Believe me,
I know where you get your ideas.

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:44.976
- But we're gonna do Janet my way.
- Who says?

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:48.688
I do. Or we'll have the same bullshit
we've had for the last five years.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.071
Bullshit?

01:28:50.116 --> 01:28:55.236
You're calling it bullshit? We know more
about this damn business than you'll...

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:01.913
Now look what you did! Get somebody,
quick. Who knows the Heimlich?

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:05.416
- I do.
- Well, help her out, for Christ's sake!

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:08.924
- Not until you agree on Janet.
- Are you crazy?

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:14.589
All right, I agree. You wanna die on
a sandwich you shouldn't even be eating?

01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:16.723
Come on, will ya?

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:25.687
- What'd you give in to him for?
- Because he loves me.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:32.114
There's a lotta love in this room.

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:36.284
- Hi. Is he in?
- He's in a meeting.

01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:38.787
- Thank you.
- May I have your name? Sir!

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:41.950
- Arnie!
- Jacko! Long time no...

01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:48.957
Mr. Fetterman!
Mr. Fetterman, are you all right?

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:52.213
No, Mom, I'm OK. Yeah.

01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:55.888
I mean, they just said they wanted
somebody more glamorous.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:04.934
Last night I had this crazy dream
that I got the part. Yeah.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:09.769
I really had a feeling that something
was gonna happen for me today.

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:14.073
I love you too. OK. Bye.

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:16.362
Oh, shoot!

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.422
Number 31, pastrami on a kaiser!

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:46.642
- Here you go, Jack.
- Thanks. Put it on the tab, will you?

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.974
Sure, Jack.

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:07.126
I can't believe this. Lox and
cream cheese on cinnamon toast?

01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:10.336
Get it outta here!

01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:25.643
I'm the lox.

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:28.230
I know.

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:31.396
Manny, we got the ants back again!

01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:34.357
- No! Stop it! Leave 'em alone!
- Hey!

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.275
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry!

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:41.906
- I don't even like ants!
- Yes, you do!

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:46.452
- I don't know why I did that.
- I do. Have you got a minute?

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:50.081
- Yeah. Where are we going?
- I don't know. I can't see.

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:54.249
Look, the part of the lesbian maid
is taken, but I'm gonna get you Janet.

01:31:55.093 --> 01:31:56.709
What happened to your body?

01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:05.392
She got the part, of course.
By the way, the show is doing great.

01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:10.723
Blake undergoes surgery for his teeth,
and the eight-pound tumour on his neck.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:15.941
Ty has an accident at the sanitarium
and is now wearing two eye patches.

01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:19.281
We brought back Len, pantyhose and all.

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:23.827
He has a major operation
and falls in love with Dr. Kirkwood.

01:32:23.913 --> 01:32:25.620
And what did I learn from this?

01:32:25.665 --> 01:32:29.499
The most important thing is that
you're better off just being yourself.

01:32:29.586 --> 01:32:32.704
Unless, of course,
you get a chance to be Robert Wagner.

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:38.088
Oh, by the way, I must confess I did
try out my typewriterjust one last time,

01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:41.800
and I think it worked.
Remember Laura, who played Rachel?

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:46.179
Well, she's turning letters
on a game show in Cleveland.
