02:14.269 --> 02:16.897
It's still on, and we're going.

02:17.105 --> 02:20.700
Cyrus sent an emissary
this afternoon to make sure.

02:20.909 --> 02:22.809
Now, Cyrus don't want
anybody packed.

02:23.011 --> 02:25.536
He don't want anybody
flexing any muscle.

02:25.747 --> 02:29.808
I gave him my word that the Warriors
would uphold the truce.

02:30.885 --> 02:34.844
Everybody says that Cyrus
is the one and only.

02:36.758 --> 02:40.194
I think we'd better go have
a look for ourself.

03:21.803 --> 03:24.431
- We ain't been to the Bronx before.
- No sweat.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.698
This conclave's gonna be
a real big item.

03:26.908 --> 03:29.274
Every gang in the city
is gonna be there.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.193
We're going in with nothing.

04:24.399 --> 04:26.697
We're going in there
like everybody else.

04:26.901 --> 04:28.835
Nine guys, no weapons.

05:09.344 --> 05:11.209
You got the stuff?

05:11.713 --> 05:13.374
I want you to hit everything in sight.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.106
I want everybody to know
the Warriors were there.

05:51.486 --> 05:53.113
You never know what's out there.

05:53.321 --> 05:56.313
- Wearing our colors, we can't hide.
- Who wants to hide?

06:31.993 --> 06:34.689
Maybe we'll get to waste
a few heads along the way.

06:34.896 --> 06:37.194
You just soldier
and keep your mouth shut.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.170
When we get there,
you stick close by, okay?

06:47.375 --> 06:49.400
Don't worry.
I don't feel like getting wrecked.

06:50.678 --> 06:54.273
One thing we might get out
of Cyrus' little get-together...

06:54.482 --> 06:56.313
...is meeting some strange wool.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.747
I wouldn't mind laying something down
on the way back.

06:58.953 --> 07:01.046
You got a one-track brain,
you know that?

07:01.255 --> 07:02.813
What's the matter?
You going faggot?

07:03.591 --> 07:05.957
What do you know about Cyrus?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.821
Magic.

07:08.296 --> 07:09.854
A whole lot of magic.

07:10.465 --> 07:14.367
- What do you know about Cyrus?
- He's the one and only.

07:15.069 --> 07:17.196
When you're president
of the biggest gang in the city,

07:17.405 --> 07:18.929
you don't have to take any shit.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.835
Fuck him.

07:32.420 --> 07:35.787
I'll tell you something,
I'll bet nobody's even gonna be there.

08:59.974 --> 09:03.432
Can you count, suckers?!

09:05.246 --> 09:09.706
I say the future is ours...

09:10.785 --> 09:14.277
...if you can count!

09:19.160 --> 09:23.688
- Come on, Cyrus, we're with you!
- Go ahead, bro!

09:27.935 --> 09:30.369
Now, look what we have
here before us.

09:31.372 --> 09:33.203
We've got the Saracens...

09:33.407 --> 09:35.705
...sitting next to
the Jones Street Boys.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.078
We've got the Moon Runners...

09:39.280 --> 09:42.511
...right by the Van Courtland Rangers.

09:43.417 --> 09:47.319
Nobody is wasting nobody.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.284
That...

09:49.490 --> 09:51.287
...is a miracle.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.223
And miracles

09:54.428 --> 09:57.056
is the way things ought to be.

09:57.265 --> 09:58.994
- Yeah!
- I heard that!

10:01.135 --> 10:04.468
- I heard that.
- Come get answered!

10:07.708 --> 10:13.772
You're standing right now
with nine delegates from 100 gangs.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.778
And there's over 100 more.

10:16.484 --> 10:20.682
That's 20,000 hard-core members.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.214
Forty thousand, counting affiliates,

10:24.425 --> 10:29.328
and 20,000 more,
not organized but ready to fight.

10:30.097 --> 10:34.056
Sixty thousand soldiers.

10:36.304 --> 10:41.901
Now, there ain't but 20,000 police
in the whole town. Can you dig it?

10:42.109 --> 10:44.202
Can you dig it?

10:44.412 --> 10:48.974
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah!

11:02.930 --> 11:05.899
Now here's the sum total.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.069
One gang could run this city.

11:10.471 --> 11:11.665
One gang.

11:13.307 --> 11:16.674
Nothing would move
without us allowing it to happen.

11:17.311 --> 11:19.677
We could tax the crime syndicates,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.279
the police,

11:21.482 --> 11:24.645
because we got the streets, suckers!

11:24.852 --> 11:28.253
Can you dig it?

11:46.841 --> 11:48.832
Right on!

11:56.517 --> 11:57.984
The problem in the past

11:58.185 --> 12:01.712
has been the man turning us
against one another.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.186
We have been unable
to see the truth,

12:04.392 --> 12:09.125
because we've been fighting
for 10 square feet of ground,

12:09.330 --> 12:14.734
our turf, our little piece of turf.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.130
That's crap, brothers.

12:17.338 --> 12:20.034
The turf is ours by right

12:20.241 --> 12:22.675
because it's our turn.

12:25.079 --> 12:26.546
All we have to do

12:26.747 --> 12:29.375
is keep up the general truce.

12:29.583 --> 12:33.144
We take over one borough at a time.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.856
Secure our territory,

12:37.892 --> 12:40.986
secure our turf

12:41.695 --> 12:46.564
because it's all our turf.

14:27.568 --> 14:29.297
The other way, against the crowd!

14:29.503 --> 14:31.130
And keep your ass down!

14:31.338 --> 14:33.238
Down!

14:38.879 --> 14:40.506
Get out of the way.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.621
They'll kill us all. Watch out, man.
Watch his head.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.163
There wasn't supposed to be
no guns!

15:04.905 --> 15:06.031
Come on, move it!

15:06.240 --> 15:07.673
- Is Cleon all right?
- He's up there.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.399
- Are you sure?
- No.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.305
Come on! Move it!

15:15.983 --> 15:18.144
There he is! That's him!

15:18.352 --> 15:20.343
That's the Warrior!

15:21.121 --> 15:24.682
- He shot Cyrus!
- Man, you're crazy. I didn't do nothing.

15:24.892 --> 15:27.486
- We saw him!
- Yeah, that's him.

15:27.695 --> 15:31.495
He's the one. He's the one!
The Warriors did it!

15:31.699 --> 15:34.668
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!

15:34.868 --> 15:37.200
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!

15:48.282 --> 15:49.909
Kill him!

16:51.979 --> 16:53.776
Down. Everybody down!

16:53.981 --> 16:55.243
- Shit!
- You all right?

16:55.449 --> 16:56.711
Yeah.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.553
Everybody quiet.

17:33.487 --> 17:34.681
Everybody make it?

17:36.724 --> 17:38.624
Just Cleon's missing.

17:38.826 --> 17:41.294
- Fuzz must've got him.
- Did you see him get busted?

17:41.495 --> 17:43.292
I seen him,
then he wasn't there no more.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.691
I was hauling ass.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.798
Why don't you look around,
make sure we're okay.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.433
This is a graveyard.

17:52.406 --> 17:53.532
What are we gonna do now?

17:57.044 --> 17:58.671
We're going back.

17:59.513 --> 18:00.844
You mind telling us how?

18:01.048 --> 18:03.983
Fucking Coney Island must be
50 to 100 miles from here.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.652
- It's the only choice we got.
- Yeah, real simple.

18:06.854 --> 18:10.312
Except that every cop in the city
is looking to bust our heads.

18:10.524 --> 18:13.186
- We got something to think about.
- Yeah? What?

18:13.394 --> 18:14.588
The truce.

18:14.795 --> 18:16.023
Is it still on?

18:16.897 --> 18:19.491
If it ain't, we're gonna have to bop
our way back.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.665
Shit, I wish we was packed.

18:30.811 --> 18:34.542
If this truce is off, anything could hit us
between here and that train.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.443
If you get separated,

18:36.650 --> 18:38.845
make it to the platform
at Union Square.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.953
- That's where we change trains.
- I only got one question:

18:47.127 --> 18:49.095
Who named you leader?

18:52.099 --> 18:54.090
I got as much right
to take over as you.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.565
It was Cleon's choice.
Swan's war chief.

18:56.770 --> 19:01.070
Right now Cleon's most likely got
a nightstick shoved halfway up his ass.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.976
Shit. I bet you can't even
find the subway.

19:07.548 --> 19:09.573
Maybe we ought to talk
about this later, huh?

19:09.783 --> 19:11.944
Well, what's wrong with right now?

19:12.152 --> 19:13.983
I wanna be warlord.

19:15.122 --> 19:16.919
Make your move.

19:17.591 --> 19:21.823
- Hey, Ajax, lighten up.
- Big boy, Swan's war chief.

19:22.296 --> 19:24.457
We better stick together.

19:26.934 --> 19:29.425
Hey, you guys!
The train's right over there.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.535
Come on. Hurry up. Let's go!

19:34.475 --> 19:35.737
Let's move.

19:38.812 --> 19:41.303
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
Stay loose.

19:41.515 --> 19:42.948
Fuck.

19:44.218 --> 19:46.652
Rembrandt, mark this spot.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.936
Hey! Wait for me!

20:56.223 --> 20:57.190
Riffs!

20:57.391 --> 21:00.087
Yeah, right!

21:12.773 --> 21:15.139
Who are the Warriors?

21:28.455 --> 21:30.514
There must be some word.

21:35.228 --> 21:36.718
I want them all.

21:37.331 --> 21:39.765
I want all the Warriors!

21:39.967 --> 21:43.562
I want them alive, if possible.
If not, wasted.

21:44.338 --> 21:46.306
But I want them.

21:56.550 --> 21:58.541
Send the word.

22:02.356 --> 22:06.258
All right, now, for all you boppers
out there in the big city,

22:06.460 --> 22:09.224
all you street people
with an ear for the action,

22:09.429 --> 22:13.388
I've been asked to relay a request
from the Gramercy Riffs.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.568
It's a special for the Warriors.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.533
That's that real,
live bunch from Coney.

22:18.739 --> 22:21.708
And I do mean the Warriors.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.399
Here's a hit with them in mind.

24:44.451 --> 24:46.316
Be looking good, Warriors.

24:46.686 --> 24:49.382
All the way back to Coney.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.420
You hear me, babies?

24:51.625 --> 24:54.890
Good. Real good.

24:55.095 --> 24:56.892
<i>AdiÃ³s. </i>

25:06.806 --> 25:10.765
- Come on. What kind of crap is this?
- Yeah. What are we waiting for?

25:10.976 --> 25:12.204
A train would help,

25:12.411 --> 25:15.312
unless you wanna go up there and
get japed on an open platform.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.505
Bullshit, man.
There ain't nobody on the street.

25:17.716 --> 25:20.412
He's right. We're acting like faggots.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.716
Just keep talking.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.169
Move.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.445
That's the Turnbull A.C.'s.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.714
I think they forgot about the truce.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.152
No shit.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.688
Those lousy skinheaded fucks.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.575
That's our train. We gotta make it.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.245
Oh, Jesus Christ!

26:38.964 --> 26:40.591
Are we gonna go for it?

27:33.619 --> 27:35.610
Hold the fucking train!

28:18.697 --> 28:20.790
Those guys were some
desperate dudes.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.798
- So was we!
- Even fight. We could take them.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.595
Bunch of chickenshits!

28:26.805 --> 28:29.000
Those cats didn't look
too chicken shit to me.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.641
Me neither.

28:30.843 --> 28:36.611
Well, we made it. And in an hour,
it is C.I., the Big Coney.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.113
You got it. Give me that fist, buddy.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.980
When we get there,
that's when we've made it.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.118
Hey, no sweat, war chief.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.159
- Hey! I've got Coney Island!
- Yeah!

28:51.363 --> 28:53.558
Figure out how many stops
to the Union Square?

28:53.766 --> 28:56.599
Hey, come on, man.
That's high math for Rembrandt.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.862
It's all right. Nobody can read
these maps anyway.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.098
Hey, forget it. What's the difference?
We're home free.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.048
We just heard from the Turnbulls.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.047
They blew it.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.337
Shit. This train's had it.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.230
This is fucking impossible.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.104
What the shit are we gonna do?
This sucks.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.744
Why couldn't it rain now?

29:40.946 --> 29:44.404
Maybe we ought to worry about
who set that goddamn fire.

29:44.883 --> 29:46.475
Come on.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.969
Yeah.

30:16.181 --> 30:17.648
How are you?

30:17.850 --> 30:20.045
I was just checking in.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.982
Yeah, it was a real mess up there.

30:23.188 --> 30:25.281
This guy, Cyrus,

30:25.491 --> 30:27.925
had an accident.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.156
They did?

30:32.598 --> 30:34.156
Well, that's okay.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.235
These guys, the Warriors...

30:38.871 --> 30:40.896
Yeah, they deserve it.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.269
Yeah, we will.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.001
Take care of yourself.

30:49.047 --> 30:52.312
- We set?
- We're set, all right.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.850
Somebody should pick their ass up.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.179
The Riffs sent out the word.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.754
They want them alive.
We don't.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.720
The sooner someone grabs them,
the better.

31:00.926 --> 31:05.124
You afraid the Warriors will shoot their
mouths off before they get racked?

31:05.330 --> 31:06.627
Yeah. Right. I'm worried.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.323
- I just don't want the Riffs on my ass.
- No sweat.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.561
They're looking for the Warriors,
remember?

31:14.373 --> 31:17.069
We can do some looking too.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.506
Ought to make you feel better.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.478
Hey.

31:23.682 --> 31:26.742
- What about the money you owe?
- For what?!

31:47.839 --> 31:49.704
We've had it.

31:51.510 --> 31:52.909
Yeah, I made them.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.442
Two there, one there.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.170
I think they just made us.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.006
You recognize them?

31:59.218 --> 32:00.344
Orphans.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.816
So far down,
they ain't even on the map.

32:03.021 --> 32:04.511
Real low-class.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.886
- Numbers?
- Full strength, maybe 30.

32:08.126 --> 32:09.718
Thirty's a lot more than eight.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.022
Not if they're wimps.
And I'm sick of this running crap.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.232
Come on. This way.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.423
Hey.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.131
- You know where that cat's headed.
- Yeah. Reinforcements.

32:53.338 --> 32:56.068
We're gonna get japed here.
We're gonna get japed.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.806
No matter what he says,
nobody lip-off.

33:05.017 --> 33:08.453
Nobody get hot.
I'm gonna see what I can do.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.350
- When did you turn into a diplomat?
- Yeah.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.956
You ain't exactly
the State Department type.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.252
Fox, you come with me.

33:25.103 --> 33:30.302
- You ought to show me your invitation.
- How do you figure?

33:30.509 --> 33:34.775
Well, you come armying down here,
invading our territory.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.971
No permits, no parley.

33:37.883 --> 33:40.818
We're not invading.
And I'm parleying right now.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.180
We were just at that big meeting
up in the Bronx.

33:43.388 --> 33:44.582
We're going home to Coney.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.226
The train gets messed up by the fire
and dumps us here.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.419
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.497
How could this be a big meeting
if the Orphans wasn't there?

33:54.700 --> 33:57.794
You didn't miss anything. There was a
lot of hassle. A lot of heads got busted.

33:58.003 --> 34:01.495
You think the Orphans ain't with it?
You think we ain't well-known?

34:01.707 --> 34:04.369
- We didn't say that.
- Well, we got a heavy rep.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.441
You mess with us,
and you'll find that out.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.387
You see that?

34:19.591 --> 34:21.616
They write about our raids
in the paper.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.721
Yeah.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.021
That's really heavy.

34:27.232 --> 34:28.859
The Orphans, right?

34:29.067 --> 34:32.195
Yeah, our youth worker,
she talks about you guys all the time.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.371
We ain't got one.

34:35.206 --> 34:39.303
That must be because you guys
are so bad, they're afraid of you.

34:48.186 --> 34:52.679
You can make it through our territory,
as long as you're coming in peace.

35:06.171 --> 35:07.763
Cut it, Mercy.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.899
You know what that is, don't you?

35:12.544 --> 35:13.738
Yeah.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.144
Trouble.

35:23.054 --> 35:25.249
Those vests are real nice.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.184
Lighten up, Mercy.
Stop looking for trouble now.

35:28.393 --> 35:31.760
- I should've slapped your mouth
- So who stopped you?

35:36.835 --> 35:38.632
Come on. Give me one.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.206
Just one.

35:42.974 --> 35:47.138
I just want one vest.
You can get another one, man.

35:48.213 --> 35:49.612
No chance.

35:55.420 --> 35:59.015
Are you just gonna let an army walk
through here any time they feel like it?

35:59.224 --> 36:02.250
- How's it gonna look?
- Get lost.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.726
You know, pretty soon, every gang
is just gonna boogie right in,

36:05.931 --> 36:07.296
soldier right through.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.594
I'll tell you, some man you are.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.738
Take your colors off,
you can walk through.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.316
- We don't do that.
- It's just our mark. It don't mean war.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.784
You go as civilians, okay? Go as
soldiers, I gotta come down on you.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.422
Now take off your colors.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.122
You hear me?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.126
Fuck you.

36:58.016 --> 37:02.350
We're not gonna hide who we are just
because some whore shakes her ass.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.681
Don't call me no whore.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.982
I ain't no whore!

37:08.493 --> 37:10.222
Let's go.

37:19.070 --> 37:23.837
We're marching to the next station
through these lame fucks's territory.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.839
Now let's move.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.639
Yeah. That's right, Warriors.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.009
Just keep walking.

37:32.217 --> 37:34.879
Real tough mothers, ain't you?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.350
You guys don't show me much.

37:37.556 --> 37:41.515
Why don't you dickheads
just walk all the way back home!

37:45.363 --> 37:48.526
- Boy, that chick's got some mouth.
- You two were terrific back there.

37:49.267 --> 37:53.397
- You guys let them down, but good.
- His ass gonna be ringing for a month.

37:53.605 --> 37:57.803
- I say we should have wasted them.
- Come on. The station's this way.

39:16.554 --> 39:19.284
Let me go! Let me be.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.595
Okay, what do you got in mind?

39:32.404 --> 39:34.770
Well, maybe I'm looking
for some real action.

39:35.407 --> 39:38.535
Hey, what about me?
I got the big one.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.773
I'll give it to you, baby.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.948
Let her go.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.050
You gonna jump me?

39:50.255 --> 39:54.453
Maybe we ought to pull a train on you.
You look like you might even like it.

39:54.659 --> 39:58.060
- Fuck you!
- Real tough chick.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.405
You see what you get, Warriors?!

40:14.612 --> 40:16.773
You see what you get
when you mess with the Orphans?!

40:25.790 --> 40:28.350
We're gonna rain on you, Warriors!

40:37.769 --> 40:40.237
- Holy shit!
- Now!

40:53.985 --> 40:57.148
- Move, move!
- Where is everybody?

40:57.355 --> 40:59.084
Come on!

41:25.016 --> 41:27.814
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta ask a question.

41:28.453 --> 41:30.318
How come we're running?

41:32.023 --> 41:34.924
I told you, they're a bunch of wimps.

41:35.126 --> 41:37.458
Union Station, here we come.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.027
Hey, what about me?

41:45.069 --> 41:47.230
So, what about you?

41:59.884 --> 42:02.011
We got a report from the Bronx.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.745
Some smalltime clique
ran into them.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.287
The Orphans.

42:06.491 --> 42:10.257
- They're not in our network.
- They rumble anyway.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.026
They got wasted.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.937
Okay, let's get down to it, boppers.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.042
We're gonna have to do
better out there.

42:26.244 --> 42:30.078
Our friends just made it past
one of the minor league teams.

42:30.281 --> 42:32.010
Remember, boppers,

42:32.217 --> 42:34.617
be looking good.

42:35.787 --> 42:38.119
All that's going on?

42:39.858 --> 42:41.883
Right. Great.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.987
Great.

42:44.596 --> 42:46.496
Yeah.

42:52.637 --> 42:53.604
Well?

42:53.805 --> 42:56.899
Some two-bit outfit almost got them,
but bopped their way past.

42:57.108 --> 43:01.670
- We can meet them at 96th Street.
- The platform's crawling with cops.

43:01.880 --> 43:05.008
Cops are trying to rack up
every gang in this town.

43:05.216 --> 43:09.710
- Me and you included.
- How come you're so happy?

43:09.921 --> 43:12.913
I'm having a good time.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.524
Let's go!

43:33.211 --> 43:36.271
How much longer we gotta wait?
We might be here forever.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.972
I'm sick of waiting for trains.

43:39.183 --> 43:41.777
Vermin, sit down and shut up.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.785
Okay, okay.

44:24.262 --> 44:25.991
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?

44:30.268 --> 44:31.860
Hey, hold it!

44:32.637 --> 44:35.128
- Right there.
- Come on.

44:35.340 --> 44:36.830
- Hold it.
- Hey.

44:42.213 --> 44:43.510
Take the uptown.

44:43.715 --> 44:46.013
- Make it! Make it!
- Move!

44:46.217 --> 44:49.778
- Hey! Move! Move!
- Wait up!

44:49.988 --> 44:53.287
- Come back here!
- Hold it!

45:02.533 --> 45:04.592
Let's double back!

45:05.570 --> 45:07.128
- This way!
- No. Come on. Over here.

45:07.338 --> 45:08.999
That way! Go!

45:10.775 --> 45:12.174
- Down the stairs!
- Hurry up.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.679
- The street!
- Far enough, already.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.319
This way.

45:25.590 --> 45:26.784
Oh, shit!

45:27.925 --> 45:29.051
Run!

45:29.594 --> 45:31.425
Just get out of here!

45:31.629 --> 45:32.823
Move!

45:34.999 --> 45:38.025
- Goddamn you!
- Let go of me!

45:56.187 --> 45:57.518
Where are they?

45:59.557 --> 46:02.321
- Union Square! Union Square!
- What about the others?

46:02.527 --> 46:03.585
We gotta go!

46:04.562 --> 46:06.962
Keep after them! Keep on!

46:38.763 --> 46:40.890
Maybe we'd better take off.

46:41.099 --> 46:42.589
Yeah. Right.

47:09.527 --> 47:12.462
- Did we lose these fucking clowns?
- Look.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.561
Holy shit!

48:19.197 --> 48:20.391
Snow, with me!

48:55.833 --> 48:57.027
Hey!

49:15.152 --> 49:17.017
I can't make it.

49:17.221 --> 49:20.019
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

49:20.424 --> 49:23.188
Good. I'm sick of running
from these wimps.

49:40.444 --> 49:44.312
I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass
and turn you into a Popsicle.

49:44.815 --> 49:45.975
Come on.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.565
- Fucking-A.
- Hey!

51:02.393 --> 51:04.054
Come on, cowboy.

51:13.237 --> 51:15.899
Shit, I figured they were wimps.

51:19.610 --> 51:22.511
The latest sports news
off the street, boppers.

51:22.713 --> 51:26.410
The Baseball Furies dropped the ball,
made an error.

51:26.617 --> 51:30.781
Our friends are on second base
and trying to make it all the way home.

51:30.988 --> 51:34.583
But the inside word is that
the odds are against them.

51:34.792 --> 51:36.282
Stay tuned, boppers.

51:37.161 --> 51:39.288
Stay tuned.

52:02.219 --> 52:05.746
- Where is everybody?
- Looks like we're the first ones here.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.686
We're just gonna
have to sit and wait.

52:08.893 --> 52:10.690
They'll show up.

52:10.895 --> 52:13.295
Looks like something else
showed up.

52:14.098 --> 52:15.690
Well, hey, hey, hey.

52:15.900 --> 52:19.199
Now look at what you find here
in the big city.

52:19.403 --> 52:21.894
- Man, you guys. We ain't got time.
- You kidding?

52:22.106 --> 52:25.234
Time's what we got plenty of.

52:36.420 --> 52:38.115
Hi.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.196
Hey.

53:13.357 --> 53:14.847
Hey.

53:20.764 --> 53:22.493
Hey.

53:24.535 --> 53:27.095
I guess she don't know
that parks ain't safe after dark.

53:27.304 --> 53:31.764
- We ain't got time for this right now.
- We've got to get to Union Square.

53:32.610 --> 53:35.875
You go ahead if you want.
I'm gonna get a little exercise.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.378
You never were very smart.

53:39.817 --> 53:42.115
I'll tell you something, warlord.

53:42.319 --> 53:43.911
I'm smart enough.

53:44.121 --> 53:45.782
And it's there for free.

53:45.990 --> 53:48.117
You two coming?

53:48.726 --> 53:52.822
- Come on, man.
- There's plenty of women back home.

53:54.598 --> 53:56.862
Maybe all of you just going faggot.

54:13.217 --> 54:15.879
You feeling all right, lady?

54:16.086 --> 54:17.849
You need a little help or something?

54:18.055 --> 54:21.513
Why don't you sit down.
Keep me company.

54:25.262 --> 54:26.661
Whatever you say, lady.

54:29.366 --> 54:31.664
Look at those muscles.

54:31.869 --> 54:35.361
I bet the chicks like
all those muscles.

54:44.982 --> 54:46.506
Hey.

54:48.218 --> 54:50.516
We better go back
and look out for him.

54:53.123 --> 54:55.216
He saved my ass back there.

54:55.426 --> 54:57.087
I owe him.

54:57.628 --> 55:00.688
Okay, I'll go look for the others.

55:10.841 --> 55:13.969
You wanna show me how you play
with the chicks?

55:15.713 --> 55:17.408
Yeah.

55:18.349 --> 55:21.978
- I'll show you how I play.
- Hey!

55:22.186 --> 55:24.211
Not so rough. Come on.

55:24.421 --> 55:28.824
- We'll get it on.
- You don't get it. I like it rough.

55:40.104 --> 55:43.369
Your nights in the park
are over for a while, honey.

55:43.574 --> 55:45.405
- You're under arrest.
- Hey, lady...

55:45.609 --> 55:47.338
Come on, lady.

55:47.878 --> 55:50.176
Kiss my ass.

55:52.116 --> 55:53.583
Come on, lady.

55:57.588 --> 56:01.718
Come on. Quit playing around.
You don't wanna play around with me!

56:04.995 --> 56:06.895
Let me out of this thing!

56:07.097 --> 56:08.655
You hear me?!

56:13.637 --> 56:16.265
Goddamn it! Let me go!

56:20.544 --> 56:22.637
Let me go!

56:22.846 --> 56:26.873
You can't do this to me!
Come on, you lousy bitch!

56:53.210 --> 56:54.973
Fucking wimp.

57:35.753 --> 57:37.311
Hey, wait!

57:41.191 --> 57:43.421
Still cops all over the place.

57:45.829 --> 57:47.387
Where's the Fox?

57:47.598 --> 57:49.429
A cop grabbed him.

57:50.901 --> 57:53.267
So how come you hung around?

57:55.606 --> 57:57.005
I don't know.

57:58.742 --> 58:02.075
- Where did you get the coat?
- You ask a lot of questions.

58:02.279 --> 58:04.270
Don't give me that.

58:06.416 --> 58:08.475
I stole it.

58:08.852 --> 58:11.719
Cops are looking for somebody
in a pink top.

58:12.456 --> 58:14.083
Real tough chick.

58:14.291 --> 58:16.759
Right. You said that before.

58:18.395 --> 58:21.728
If you still wanna get to Union Square,
I can show you where to grab the train.

58:23.400 --> 58:24.867
Okay.

58:25.068 --> 58:26.467
Come on.

58:29.740 --> 58:31.230
Hey.

59:20.490 --> 59:22.481
Hey!

59:33.437 --> 59:34.961
- What is that?
- Hold it!

59:35.172 --> 59:36.833
- Freeze!
- Go on.

59:37.341 --> 59:38.535
Move it!

59:38.742 --> 59:40.175
- Jesus!
- Come on!

59:40.377 --> 59:42.140
Run!

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.757
Is this the place?

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:08.732
Hey, I hate asking the questions,
but where's the dudes?

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.100
Chicks like you always got
dudes around.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:14.106
They took the night off.
Went up to the Bronx.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:15.801
Don't worry about them.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:19.073
They're lame, real cripples.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.817
Come on.

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.956
When I got off that subway
and I saw you, I thought:

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:38.862
"Oh, baby, throw it my way. "

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:41.367
I mean, it's really great
of you chicks taking us in.

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:45.667
We know about the Warriors.
They're a heavy outfit. We know you.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:49.004
- How'd you hear about us?
- You know how. Word gets around.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:55.016
- I guess we are pretty well-known.
- Come on.

01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:28.073
You're the first friendly faces
we've seen all night.

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:29.718
That's the way we are.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.320
Let's party a little.
Get something going.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:37.084
- Yeah, sure. Hey, I can dig that.
- Hey, you came to the right guys.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.256
Oh, hurt me, hurt me.

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:44.730
Don't thank us, man. Just relax.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.596
Fall out.

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.896
Take your pick.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:59.275
Thanks. This is a great outfit.

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:02.452
- What clique is this?
- We're the Lizzies.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:05.316
Lizzies. Hey, great.

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:07.581
Just great. I like that. I like it.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.355
Glad to hear it.

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:16.156
Man, we got to come
to this part of town more often.

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:18.061
Yeah, right.

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:23.238
That's right. Got to.

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:27.867
Thanks a lot.

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:34.874
- Looks like you're the winner.
- Yeah, right.

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:47.159
How much longer are we
gonna hang around here?

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:51.825
- What's your hurry? We just got here.
- We ought to get to Union Square.

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:55.232
- They're gonna be worried about us.
- Yeah, sure. In a minute.

01:02:55.739 --> 01:02:56.865
Quit breaking the action.

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:30.635
Can we stop for a minute? I'm sick
of this crap. My legs are getting tired.

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.867
- Come on. Just keep walking.
- Well, what's your hurry?

01:03:34.077 --> 01:03:37.410
Trying to set some kind of
a world record or something?

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.614
Hey.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.556
- Just walk.
- I'm walking.

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:55.788
Jesus, why don't you give me
a break.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.201
Be a little friendly.
I don't even know your name.

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.769
My name's Swan.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.869
What do you care about
names so much for?

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:09.011
I like telling my friends
I been with somebody particular.

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:10.804
You know what I mean?

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:14.074
Why don't you just
tie a mattress to your back.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:17.715
You don't care where it is, do you?

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:22.051
Look, what do you got against me?
You been picking on me all night.

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:24.090
You want me to tell you the truth?

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.761
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:28.123
I don't like the way you live.

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:30.796
- The way I live?
- Yeah.

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:34.599
I keep hoping I'm gonna run into
something a little better.

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:37.204
What kind of crap is this?

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.398
Who are you?
You ain't any better than me.

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.804
I guess you like the way
everything's going for you.

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:43.604
Well, maybe I do.

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:47.078
Friday nights are pretty good.
Saturday nights are better.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:50.447
I don't think you can remember
who you get on Friday and Saturday.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.781
I don't think you can remember
what they look like.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:57.085
Sometimes I can, and sometimes
I can't. Who gives a damn?

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:02.564
I see what's happening next door
and down the block,

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:05.428
belly hanging down, five kids,

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:08.069
cockroaches in the cupboard.

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:11.939
I'll tell you what I want.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.877
I want something now.

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:18.514
This is the life I got left.
You know what I mean?

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:22.250
You get it, Warrior?

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.243
Get it?

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:44.139
How do you like it?

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.282
Come on. What's wrong?

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.112
Let's just get
to the next station, okay?

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.017
No.

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:36.658
Please?

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.589
Come on.

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:41.129
Come on.

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:47.363
You're just part of everything that's
happening tonight, and it's all bad.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.731
Just go back to wherever it was
you came from.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:42.455
Hey, little man, you wanna dance?

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.926
I'll be right with you, babe.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:40.346
So you're the famous Warriors,
the guys that shot Cyrus.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:43.075
Shit! The chicks are packed.
The chicks are packed!

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.479
Shit!

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:14.907
Shit.

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:30.595
She cut me. She cut me.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:33.162
Look. Look, man.

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:36.770
Now we gotta hold ourselves together.
We got to.

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:41.103
See, man, now if we go to pieces,
somebody out there's gonna get us.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.743
They think we shot Cyrus.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:47.216
- What are you talking about?
- They think we shot Cyrus.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:49.544
Every gang in this city
must be looking for us.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.947
Holy shit!

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:55.123
We're not gonna be able
to make it back.

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:57.054
We're gonna make it back.

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.285
We came this far.
We'll go the rest of the way.

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:04.130
Let's go to Union Square, okay?
We gotta tell the rest of the guys.

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:20.698
Hey.

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:23.804
Where's the rest of them?

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.673
Yeah, right.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.113
Where's everybody else?

01:12:36.319 --> 01:12:40.119
Cops got Ajax.
We don't know about Swan.

01:12:40.323 --> 01:12:43.815
- Oh, Jesus!
- Are you sure about Ajax?

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:46.295
Real sure.

01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:49.194
I bet he went out swinging.

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:51.761
We better go look for Swan.

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:57.338
God, I can't believe it.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.338
Yeah. What is this shit?

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:26.832
I need to talk to you.

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:30.602
See that dude over there
with the skates?

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:33.937
Over there.

01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:37.874
He's after you.
And he's got some guys with him.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.378
I know they're on my ass.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.719
But now they know I know it.

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:53.324
Well, what are you gonna do?

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.893
Come on.

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:32.533
You sure change your mind fast.

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:37.172
- I was kind of rough on you there.
- Listen, I can take care of myself.

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:39.398
Sure. Come on.

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:50.112
Wait a minute. I can't go in there.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.378
It's a men's room.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:55.090
Are you kidding?

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:45.795
Get him!

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:21.190
What about our patrols?

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:23.627
So far, nothing.

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.431
But we've got somebody here
you ought to talk to.

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:30.298
He says he saw who shot Cyrus.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:53.458
Big Cyrus,
he was gonna run the whole city.

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:56.096
What crap that was.

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:59.267
Cyrus was right about one thing.

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:02.130
It's all out there.

01:19:02.338 --> 01:19:04.932
All we gotta do is just figure out
a way to go steal it.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:06.836
Sounds great.

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:10.570
All you gotta do is figure out
what's worth stealing.

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:37.665
Okay, come on. Let's go.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.938
Come on, let me get some breakfast
or something.

01:20:51.547 --> 01:20:53.879
- Let's get off here.
- Yeah.

01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:11.924
What's this for?

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.730
I just hate seeing anything
go to waste.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:29.769
This is what we fought all night
to get back to?

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:34.445
Maybe I'll just take off.

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:38.050
Well, you know I like traveling too.

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:40.883
Where have you ever been?

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:44.425
I never been anywhere.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.027
I just know I'd like it.

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:52.292
Come on. Let's go.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.141
Stay right on their ass.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:56.497
Wait a couple seconds after we move,
then cut out the other way.

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:59.293
- Why can't I stay with you?
- Just do what I tell you.

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.731
- Okay?
- Come on.

01:24:01.937 --> 01:24:04.428
I can take care of myself.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.608
I proved that.

01:24:08.077 --> 01:24:09.806
Come on.

01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:07.893
Warriors.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:11.664
Come out to play!

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.236
Warriors.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:19.505
Come out to play!

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.050
Warriors.

01:25:23.252 --> 01:25:27.052
Come out to play.

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:29.619
Warriors.

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:33.989
Come out to play.

01:25:34.196 --> 01:25:36.027
Warriors.

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:38.131
Come out to play!

01:25:43.105 --> 01:25:44.663
Everybody packed?

01:25:46.108 --> 01:25:47.666
Yeah.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:52.905
All of you stay behind me.
I'm gonna take them out to the sand.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.116
What about you? You ready?

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:01.619
Let's do it.

01:27:08.757 --> 01:27:13.194
When we see the ocean,
we figure we're home, we're safe.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:16.126
This time, you got it wrong.

01:27:19.768 --> 01:27:21.668
Why did you do it?

01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:24.031
Why did you waste Cyrus?

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.070
No reason.

01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:30.305
I just like doing things like that.

01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:39.545
Let's do it, me and you.

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:42.053
One on one?

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.384
You're crazy.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:49.397
You're dead,

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:52.260
all of you, and you know it.

01:27:53.869 --> 01:27:55.166
- You're dead.
- Swan!

01:28:24.066 --> 01:28:26.557
- Riffs!
- Yeah, right!

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:56.998
You still looking for us?

01:28:59.468 --> 01:29:01.834
We found what we're looking for.

01:29:03.472 --> 01:29:05.337
No.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.508
No.

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.540
It wasn't us.

01:29:09.745 --> 01:29:13.340
It was them, the Warriors.

01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:16.117
You Warriors are good.

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.253
Real good.

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:22.813
The best.

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.489
The rest is ours.

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:59.055
No!

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:05.496
Good news, boppers.
The big alert has been called off.

01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:10.195
It turns out that the early reports
were wrong, all wrong.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:14.739
Now for that group out there that had
such a hard time getting home,

01:30:14.943 --> 01:30:16.808
sorry about that.

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:21.073
I guess the only thing we can do
is play you a song.
