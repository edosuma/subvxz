00:01.147 --> 00:02.453
<i>House meeting.</i>

00:02.538 --> 00:05.125
House meeting, everyone.
Hello?

00:05.266 --> 00:06.922
Ah, Nadja.
Uh, the house meeting

00:07.007 --> 00:08.969
was supposed to
start 15 minutes ago.

00:09.054 --> 00:10.391
- Where's Laszlo?
- He is tending

00:10.476 --> 00:11.516
to his fruit trees.

00:11.601 --> 00:13.251
Okay, great. So maybe
you want to fetch him,

00:13.335 --> 00:14.750
and we can begin
the house meeting.

00:14.835 --> 00:16.571
No, I cannot go and "fetch" him.

00:16.656 --> 00:17.875
That is a job for Guillermo.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.032
Guillermo is
on a break at the moment.

00:20.117 --> 00:21.297
Sorry, a what?

00:21.382 --> 00:23.422
<i>From now on,
Guillermo will receive</i>

00:23.514 --> 00:25.210
<i>one day off per week.</i>

00:26.742 --> 00:29.382
Plus a 15-minute break
every four hours.

00:29.631 --> 00:31.836
<i>This is all my idea,
of course,</i>

00:31.921 --> 00:34.079
- not Guillermo's idea.
- Guillermo,

00:34.164 --> 00:36.291
I give you permission to take
a break from your breaking.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.790
Guillermo, you will do
no such thing. You will not break...

00:38.874 --> 00:40.461
<i>Starting to
think my whole life is a big pile</i>

00:40.545 --> 00:41.750
<i>of bullshit.</i>

00:41.835 --> 00:43.125
<i>Sometimes this job seems like</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:45.460
a really childish
career choice.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.329
<i>Like, what am I doing here?</i>

00:47.421 --> 00:48.955
I don't know.
Maybe it's time to grow up

00:49.039 --> 00:51.859
<i>and get a real job
with real people.</i>

00:51.968 --> 00:53.312
<i>Maybe I could start a business?</i>

00:53.467 --> 00:55.180
<i>I was using these Tide pens
the other day</i>

00:55.265 --> 00:56.901
to take off blood
off my clothes.

00:57.046 --> 01:00.015
And I thought,
I don't have to do this. I...

01:00.100 --> 01:02.018
I dumped all of this...

01:02.476 --> 01:05.054
into <i>this</i> to make <i>this.</i>

01:05.179 --> 01:06.310
<i>Isn't that cool?</i>

01:06.394 --> 01:08.102
<i>It's a Heavy Duty
Blood Remover.</i>

01:08.194 --> 01:09.987
Been watching
a lot of Shark Tank lately.

01:10.249 --> 01:12.852
<i>The sky will be the limit.
What do you say?</i>

01:12.952 --> 01:15.433
- Can we make a deal today?
<i>- I am not fetching anyone!</i>

01:15.860 --> 01:18.227
When I was a child,
I loved juicy red apples.

01:19.062 --> 01:21.156
Now they just smell
like shit and decay.

01:21.241 --> 01:23.695
So now what I basically do
is cut them off the tree

01:23.780 --> 01:25.156
and throw them on the floor.

01:26.765 --> 01:28.897
Laszlo.

01:30.254 --> 01:31.371
Did you hear that?

01:31.456 --> 01:34.041
Laszlo Cravensworth.

01:34.288 --> 01:36.373
Who calls the Cravensworth?

01:36.577 --> 01:39.687
You have a lot of nerve
disturbing me,

01:39.772 --> 01:41.757
in my garden, pruning.

01:42.569 --> 01:45.641
It would be best for everybody
if you show yourself <i>now.</i>

01:47.942 --> 01:48.954
A goat.

01:49.039 --> 01:50.397
Bell ringing

01:50.482 --> 01:52.749
Your shepherd will be wondering
where the hell you are.

01:52.841 --> 01:56.358
- Laszlo! House meeting time.
- Yeah, I'll be there momentarily.

01:56.443 --> 01:57.914
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:57.998 --> 02:00.232
What kind
of goat sorcery is this?

02:00.326 --> 02:02.999
<i>The ceremony awaits you.</i>

02:03.084 --> 02:04.718
Help! Aah!

02:04.803 --> 02:06.882
Laszlo, the house meeting!

02:06.967 --> 02:08.951
Laszlo!

02:45.764 --> 02:48.384
I can feel something
terrible has happened.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.491
It's witches.
They have taken him!

02:50.575 --> 02:52.969
I can feel it on the inside
of my bones.

02:53.053 --> 02:54.149
Ah...

02:54.273 --> 02:57.453
<i>I'm not saying
that Nadja is hysterical, but</i>

02:57.548 --> 03:00.985
she blames everything
on witches.

03:02.352 --> 03:03.478
Witches are near.

03:03.563 --> 03:05.602
Like every
little fucking thing.

03:07.024 --> 03:08.462
<i>The witches
have been toying</i>

03:08.547 --> 03:10.009
with our rugs again.
Please get some

03:10.094 --> 03:12.649
witch-proof carpet tape
and tape that rug down.

03:13.219 --> 03:15.267
Witches! Aah!

03:15.352 --> 03:16.984
See?

03:17.492 --> 03:19.040
Witch dust.
Ugh!

03:19.125 --> 03:21.719
- Or dirt.
- It's not... not witch dust.

03:21.804 --> 03:22.899
Oh, it stinks.

03:22.984 --> 03:23.993
Nobody breathe it in.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.681
It's how they seize
control of your mind.

03:25.766 --> 03:27.868
We're going to
have to burn the garden.

03:27.953 --> 03:30.462
- We have to do something!
- I think perhaps the best place

03:30.547 --> 03:32.353
to start is
to look around here.

03:32.438 --> 03:33.837
- Let's do that.
- Excuse me.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.986
Guillermo,
you will join us, too.

03:36.071 --> 03:38.711
Nah, that's not
in my job description.

03:38.796 --> 03:40.093
Laszlo?

03:40.177 --> 03:41.953
Did you fall down
a hole again?

03:42.060 --> 03:43.828
Nandor.

03:43.946 --> 03:46.728
- Did somebody call my name?
- No, no, shit, Nandor, don't!

03:46.813 --> 03:48.892
Hey, there's a goat
over here.

03:48.977 --> 03:52.204
- Hello, Mr. Goat.
- Nandor, it's... No, don't!

03:52.289 --> 03:54.024
You're very handsome,
aren't you?

03:54.171 --> 03:55.437
Have we met before?

03:55.521 --> 03:59.523
- <i>The ceremony awaits you.</i>
- Hey. Wait. Hey!

03:59.607 --> 04:00.634
<i>Whoa!</i>

04:00.718 --> 04:02.086
Shit, shit, shit.

04:02.171 --> 04:04.836
- Okay. I'll get the keys.
- Yes, you bloody will.

04:04.921 --> 04:07.625
I'll be damned. Witches.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.038
Colin, hurry!

04:12.272 --> 04:13.913
Can you not make

04:13.997 --> 04:15.211
this carriage move faster?

04:15.296 --> 04:16.978
You're moving slower
than when my yaya tried

04:17.062 --> 04:18.680
to ride a snail
to the next village.

04:18.765 --> 04:20.220
If you wanted to go faster,
why didn't you fly?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.516
Ooh, it's too dangerous.

04:21.601 --> 04:23.594
Look how quickly
and disgustingly they move.

04:23.679 --> 04:24.835
They're really hauling ass.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.679
Oh, Gizmo, they're getting ready
to land.

04:26.763 --> 04:27.921
Ooh!

04:28.006 --> 04:29.438
- Ooh.
- Oh.

04:29.523 --> 04:31.477
Well, luckily,
that was just Nandor.

04:31.562 --> 04:34.184
- Oh! They're moving toward the right!
- Hey! Take the next exit!

04:34.269 --> 04:35.857
No!

04:36.894 --> 04:38.959
Let go of the wheel!
Your driving's gonna kill us!

04:43.701 --> 04:45.302
Stop the machine, make it stop.

04:45.567 --> 04:46.858
Yes. They are near.

04:46.943 --> 04:49.037
The smell of beef and sulfur
is overwhelming.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.817
- That's just Brooklyn.
- Yes. It's over there.

04:51.911 --> 04:55.123
Do you want me to go in
for a quick snoop and poop?

04:55.208 --> 04:57.224
No. You cannot go.
They will sense you.

04:57.309 --> 05:00.795
No, we need a mortal.
A human. A common schlub.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.443
A nobody. Someone who's
personality is like a eunuch's.

05:03.528 --> 05:04.638
- You know?
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

05:04.722 --> 05:05.920
I'll go. All right?
I'll go.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.390
Oh, really, Guillermo, I would
never have... <font color="#ffff00">- Right, I'll do it.</font>

05:07.474 --> 05:08.865
No. I'll go. - Thank you,
Guillermo. - I just...

05:08.949 --> 05:10.747
Don't worry.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.599
I have to do everything
myself.

05:12.731 --> 05:15.606
You guys stay back, okay?
Just stay back here.

05:18.809 --> 05:20.355
Anything I can help you find?

05:20.510 --> 05:22.770
No. No, I'm just...

05:23.112 --> 05:25.684
taking a look at, um...

05:26.512 --> 05:28.036
Is this...
is this the only room,

05:28.121 --> 05:31.102
or is there another room
with other stuff, or...?

05:31.187 --> 05:32.738
You're looking
for something specific?

05:32.822 --> 05:33.888
Any allergies?

05:33.973 --> 05:36.040
No. I mean, my nose is stuffy,
but I don't know

05:36.125 --> 05:37.410
if it's because
of a food allergy

05:37.494 --> 05:39.303
- or a seasonal allergy, or...
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.388 --> 05:41.380
Oh, no, you don't have
to do that. No, thank you.

05:41.464 --> 05:43.028
No. No. I'm not good at...

05:43.192 --> 05:45.685
- Mmm...
- Oh, that feels good.

05:45.770 --> 05:48.435
Oh, I think she's trying
to squeeze Gizmo's eyeballs out.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.557
The consensus on Instagram
is that we underestimate

05:51.641 --> 05:53.359
the importance of self-care.

05:53.443 --> 05:54.860
Hang on.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.451
Oh, shit.

05:57.536 --> 06:00.239
- Oh!
- Fuck.

06:01.427 --> 06:04.602
Do you have anything
for Rosacea?

06:04.702 --> 06:08.138
I think I have
a little flare-up on my chin.

06:08.231 --> 06:09.942
Come with me.
Bring the cameras.

06:10.027 --> 06:11.872
- There's no...
<i>- This way.</i>

06:20.155 --> 06:21.974
Fire.

06:22.059 --> 06:24.576
I say, ladies,
perhaps we could come

06:24.661 --> 06:26.053
to some kind of arrangement?

06:26.138 --> 06:29.278
I mean, you don't need
the two of us, surely. No?

06:29.778 --> 06:31.809
Psst, guys.

06:32.419 --> 06:33.817
A little help?

06:34.537 --> 06:37.209
- Intruders! Intruders!
- Sorry, guys.

06:37.294 --> 06:40.810
Fret not, my sisters.

06:40.895 --> 06:42.497
Let 'em in.

06:45.653 --> 06:49.084
Let the ceremony be documented

06:49.169 --> 06:51.216
for the ages.

06:53.739 --> 06:54.826
Idiot.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.410
This is kind of exciting.

06:56.502 --> 06:58.253
Little dark in here, huh?

06:58.338 --> 06:59.671
You will remain here
with the others

06:59.755 --> 07:01.201
until the ceremony is complete.

07:01.286 --> 07:02.854
What cer...?
Others, what?

07:08.489 --> 07:09.592
Wait!

07:09.677 --> 07:10.796
Guillermo, get the lights.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.624
- I'm looking for it.
- It's over there.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.162
- Over where?
- Now he's getting

07:14.246 --> 07:16.435
breaks all the time, so he doesn't want
to turn the lights on!

07:16.519 --> 07:17.363
I'm looking...

07:17.448 --> 07:19.904
- This talking back!
- I'm looking for it!

07:19.989 --> 07:21.193
Turn on the damn light!

07:21.278 --> 07:22.890
Fuck you guys.

07:22.974 --> 07:24.239
Aha!

07:25.034 --> 07:27.575
Oh, what is this place?

07:28.880 --> 07:31.802
Uh,
some sort of storage room, perhaps.

07:39.302 --> 07:40.850
Not a storage room.

07:41.898 --> 07:43.816
Places, everyone.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.763
Everything is secure?

07:47.855 --> 07:49.056
Yes.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.224
Witches!

07:53.309 --> 07:55.989
Hear me now and take note.

07:56.349 --> 07:59.802
Release us,
and you will be shown mercy.

08:00.177 --> 08:03.722
But... any further hesitation
will ensure

08:03.806 --> 08:07.809
your complete
and utter destruction!

08:13.532 --> 08:16.161
- That'll do.
- Well done, Nandor.

08:16.294 --> 08:17.631
You've certainly
frightened them.

08:17.716 --> 08:20.317
Now let us begin.

08:21.781 --> 08:23.420
Start the music.

08:23.809 --> 08:25.006
♪♪ I see you, little mama ♪♪

08:25.091 --> 08:25.944

08:28.388 --> 08:29.639

That's for the hip-hop
kundalini class we offer

08:31.669 --> 08:32.904
Tuesday, Thursday evenings.

08:32.989 --> 08:35.630
- Sorry.
- It's all right, Tessa.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.087
Start the music.

08:42.403 --> 08:43.260
What
the hell are those?

08:43.346 --> 08:45.303
I don't know...

08:45.388 --> 08:46.951
I think this is the end.

08:47.036 --> 08:49.368
Don't breathe it in.
It's some kind of...

08:49.452 --> 08:51.404
- Hey...
- Hello.

08:51.488 --> 08:53.372
I must say, I-I'm not sure

08:53.456 --> 08:55.224
I fully disapprove
of this abduction.

08:55.309 --> 08:58.841
- Relaxing, really.
- Some might say erotic.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.709
I don't know about y-you,
old chap, but

09:01.794 --> 09:04.458
- I have a raging hard-on.
- Yes.

09:05.575 --> 09:08.587
<i>These witches are sly,
but so am I.</i>

09:08.671 --> 09:10.388
<i>I think I have 'em figured out.</i>

09:10.473 --> 09:13.426
Door on the floor...
we ain't here no more.

09:13.559 --> 09:17.095
Aah! Help!

09:20.067 --> 09:21.451
That does that thing.

09:24.247 --> 09:27.217
Oh, hello. We were wondering

09:27.302 --> 09:28.396
if, um...

09:31.961 --> 09:33.403
Ma'am.

09:35.632 --> 09:37.168
- This way.
- Ah.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.701
- Later, suckers.
- And so when I saw that,

09:39.786 --> 09:42.114
I knew
it was the right door.

09:44.630 --> 09:47.537
- Puta madre.
- How many door rooms do they have?

09:47.622 --> 09:50.888
It's the same one,
Professor Pig Dick!

09:51.662 --> 09:53.732
I've done a lot of escape rooms,

09:53.817 --> 09:55.874
but I'm usually the one in
the group that is asking about

09:55.958 --> 09:59.155
where we're gonna go
for dinner afterwards

09:59.240 --> 10:01.420
and how we'll split up the bill.

10:01.505 --> 10:02.881
Don't open that, Nadja.

10:06.054 --> 10:07.865
I hate this place!

10:07.950 --> 10:11.723
Laszlo, my love,
I am coming for you. Be strong.

10:11.833 --> 10:14.068
<i>- I'm coming!</i>
- Not now! Um...

10:14.161 --> 10:17.615
I mean, um, uh,
in your own time, my darling.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.576
- No immediate hurry.
- 'Tis time

10:19.661 --> 10:21.826
- to begin the extraction.
- The what, now?

10:21.911 --> 10:23.662
- Removal of your semen.
- Oh, yes.

10:23.747 --> 10:26.403
Well, I'm quite keen
on that idea, let that be known.

10:26.558 --> 10:28.748
Now, the process

10:28.841 --> 10:29.841
will be quick...

10:30.052 --> 10:31.754
Well, that's slightly insulting
but probably true.

10:31.838 --> 10:33.756
Though I can go again.

10:33.841 --> 10:37.069
...though, I'm afraid,
not entirely painless.

10:37.154 --> 10:39.615
- Ah.
- Tess? Quinn?

10:39.700 --> 10:41.553
Ooh, look out. Marital aids?

10:41.638 --> 10:44.251
No. 18th century surgical tools.

10:45.666 --> 10:47.116
- Ew.
- Shit.

10:47.201 --> 10:49.913
Fast as you can, my dear!
Like, now!

10:49.998 --> 10:54.111
They are fully engorged.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.748
True.

10:56.161 --> 10:59.513
Let us revert to our true form.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.647
MILFs.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.850
- Even better.
- It's a contrast

11:07.935 --> 11:10.552
but something
I wouldn't say no to.

11:10.638 --> 11:14.431
I'll prepare the cauldron. Bring
me the fluid when the bowls

11:14.516 --> 11:17.631
- are filled to the brim.
- What are you doing with those?

11:17.716 --> 11:19.139
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Hi.

11:19.224 --> 11:21.234
I- I don't think that bowl's
going to be big enough.

11:21.318 --> 11:22.849
- Nadja!
- Don't think it's going to fit in there.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.473
You really need
to get here!

11:24.558 --> 11:27.706
Ah. Looks like Epicurus,

11:27.791 --> 11:31.210
the Greek philosopher
and father of hedonism.

11:31.456 --> 11:33.988
Pleasure is the absence
of suffering.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.620
The Greek word
for pleasure is...

11:37.111 --> 11:38.296
Found it.

11:38.381 --> 11:39.581
Ready?

11:39.898 --> 11:41.787
Well, h-h-how'd you find that?

11:41.872 --> 11:43.159
<i>"Salida."</i>

11:43.267 --> 11:44.885
- "Exit."
- It's in Spanish. I know.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.050
- I know that, too.
- I... I've discovered it.

11:47.135 --> 11:49.824
- I would've thought of it.
- Guillermo.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.628
I told you
I'd get us out of here.

11:51.966 --> 11:54.965
- It's for wine, isn't it?
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:55.050 --> 11:56.502
- We just met.
- Where are you going with that?

11:56.586 --> 11:58.699
Put those tiny swords down
this instant,

11:58.784 --> 12:00.878
or you'll be removing them
from your crusty old tits

12:00.963 --> 12:02.222
and dry, old asses.

12:02.307 --> 12:04.691
Ooh, my darling,
am I pleased to see you.

12:04.776 --> 12:06.544
How did you escape
from our secret room?

12:06.629 --> 12:08.167
That would be me, ma'am.
Thank you.

12:08.252 --> 12:10.722
I put together
all your clues.

12:10.816 --> 12:12.417
- Figured it out.
- Actually, it was me.

12:12.502 --> 12:13.887
I'm the one who saw...
It's in Spanish.

12:13.971 --> 12:16.675
Well, yo soy a bit
of a puzzle head.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.177
You're a man
of great intelligence.

12:18.262 --> 12:21.446
Yes, Mensa has been trying
to get me to join.

12:21.531 --> 12:24.484
You've proven that you are also
worthy of semen extraction.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.632
Oh, thank you. I'd like
to tell you you'd be the first

12:27.717 --> 12:29.355
to ever say that to me,
but you're not.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.598
Not with those, though.

12:30.682 --> 12:32.900
Yeah, that's your guy
right there.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.363
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

12:34.745 --> 12:36.347
Real nice job, Colin Robinson.

12:36.459 --> 12:38.577
Well, I know we're all having
the laugh of our lives,

12:38.661 --> 12:40.792
but sadly all parties
must come to an end.

12:40.877 --> 12:42.667
Guillermo, untie them.

12:42.752 --> 12:44.113
Can't you see
you're outnumbered?

12:44.198 --> 12:46.983
What are you gonna do...
Moisturize us to death?

12:47.076 --> 12:49.589
- No. -
- Enough.

12:51.791 --> 12:54.525
Oh, Lilith, I should have known
this was you.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.800
Your stinky old stank
was all over it.

12:56.885 --> 12:59.808
<i>Lilith is a witch I befriended
many, many years ago.</i>

12:59.893 --> 13:01.344
She used to run a shop that sold

13:01.429 --> 13:03.013
all the newest mixtures
of makeups

13:03.098 --> 13:04.821
<i>and ladies' clothings
and shirtings</i>

13:04.906 --> 13:06.433
<i>and suitings and shoesings.</i>

13:06.518 --> 13:07.768
It was all a front, of course.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.347
<i>It was a way to distribute
the very best of semens</i>

13:10.432 --> 13:11.824
<i>to any witch who needed it.</i>

13:11.909 --> 13:14.058
Naturally, we hit it off
straightaway.

13:14.186 --> 13:15.988
Very fast friends.

13:16.073 --> 13:18.745
That was,
until she did something so evil,

13:18.830 --> 13:22.152
<i>so despicable,
so unforgivable that we are now</i>

13:22.237 --> 13:24.074
sworn enemies
for the rest of time.

13:26.302 --> 13:28.453
Five spits for an enemy, Lilith.

13:28.538 --> 13:31.525
- You look so different to
how I remember you. <font color="#ffff00">- Oh, yes.</font>

13:31.610 --> 13:35.222
I appear to you now
as my natural, aged self.

13:35.307 --> 13:36.840
With every passing moment,

13:36.925 --> 13:39.605
our anti-aging spells
lose their potency.

13:39.690 --> 13:42.075
Well, over my undead body
will your crispy hands

13:42.160 --> 13:45.112
get anywhere near
my husband's sperms again.

13:45.197 --> 13:47.683
- "Again"? - Hmm?
- Yeah.

13:47.768 --> 13:49.072
Thing is,

13:49.157 --> 13:52.944
I had a bit of a knee trembler
with Lilith some time ago,

13:53.029 --> 13:55.610
and Nadja found out
and put me on her shit list.

13:55.695 --> 13:56.845
Okay...
She tricked me

13:56.930 --> 13:58.152
with her witchcraft.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.973
Oh, she tricked you, did she?
Come on, Laszlo!

14:02.712 --> 14:04.801
He does not lie.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.499
I didn't come to him
in the form you see me now.

14:06.583 --> 14:09.105
I took a form that I knew

14:09.190 --> 14:12.027
he could never resist.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.644
You.

14:14.923 --> 14:17.113
In bed, she made herself
look just like you.

14:17.198 --> 14:19.717
It's true.
Watch me now. Watch me.

14:19.802 --> 14:21.980
Watch as I transform

14:22.065 --> 14:24.184
to look exactly

14:24.269 --> 14:27.925
like... <i>you!</i>

14:28.071 --> 14:29.907
Voilà.

14:30.872 --> 14:32.675
Is that what you think
I look like?

14:33.065 --> 14:35.214
From here,
I-I can't tell the difference.

14:35.299 --> 14:37.417
You both look exactly the same.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.621
It's a completely
different woman.

14:39.706 --> 14:41.057
Sorry, you'll have
to raise your hand.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.659
Otherwise, I don't know
who's talking.

14:42.744 --> 14:45.062
- Speak for me.
- Speak for me.

14:45.455 --> 14:46.909
- She...
- The same.

14:46.994 --> 14:49.417
She's just doing
a generic European accent!

14:49.502 --> 14:51.820
"Generic European accent."

14:51.905 --> 14:54.156
- Pretty close, my love.
- Colin Robinson?

14:54.241 --> 14:55.738
- Um...
- Nandor?

14:55.823 --> 14:56.808
Uh...

14:56.893 --> 14:58.723
Look at us standing
together now. It's-it's me,

14:58.807 --> 14:59.857
and it's another woman.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.956
How many more women
have you slept with

15:02.041 --> 15:04.097
that just have long dark hair?

15:04.447 --> 15:06.956
She's got long dark hair.
Have you slept with her?

15:07.896 --> 15:09.464
Hello, Judith.

15:11.176 --> 15:13.456
Nandor's got long dark hair
and an accent.

15:13.541 --> 15:15.142
Have you slept with him?

15:17.246 --> 15:20.041
I can't believe...

15:20.183 --> 15:21.949
Right...

15:22.034 --> 15:23.784
You're welcome
to his semens.

15:23.869 --> 15:25.761
- I'm going home.
- Silence!

15:25.910 --> 15:28.128
No one is going anywhere
<i>now.</i>

15:28.222 --> 15:30.910
With the combined semen

15:31.003 --> 15:35.237
of these two vampires...

15:36.261 --> 15:37.371
What's your name?

15:37.456 --> 15:38.989
C- Colin Robinson, Miss.

15:39.074 --> 15:41.981
With Colin Robinson's

15:42.066 --> 15:43.678
semen, too,

15:43.762 --> 15:48.481
we can maintain
our youthful appearances

15:48.566 --> 15:51.712
for an even

15:51.804 --> 15:55.290
longer amount of time
than before.

15:55.374 --> 15:56.658
- Ah.
<i>- Yes, yes, yes.</i>

15:56.742 --> 15:58.660
<i>- Well done. Well done.</i>
- Thank you.

15:58.744 --> 16:00.729
Also, we use it
to make magnets.

16:00.949 --> 16:04.714
Witches.
May I ask you a quick question?

16:04.830 --> 16:08.879
What would you say if I told you
that I could provide you

16:08.964 --> 16:11.550
with all the vampire semen
and more

16:11.667 --> 16:14.309
that your little black hearts
desire?

16:14.393 --> 16:16.534
Hmm, go on.

16:16.791 --> 16:20.434
Sure, you can leave today
with a one-time extraction

16:20.519 --> 16:23.582
- from these two well-endowed...
- Three.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.558
- Hmm?
- Three well-endowed...

16:25.644 --> 16:26.942
- Okay.
- Go on.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.418
These three gentlemen.

16:29.549 --> 16:31.877
But what happens
when that semen is gone?

16:31.964 --> 16:34.696
You're out on the prowl
hunting for more.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.058
Yeah, it's true.

16:36.143 --> 16:38.965
The search for prospective
donors is a constant headache.

16:39.050 --> 16:40.160
Also,

16:40.245 --> 16:41.603
last time things...

16:42.432 --> 16:43.980
totally went off the rails.

16:44.131 --> 16:45.881
Exactly.

16:45.966 --> 16:48.871
So what would you say
if I could provide you

16:48.956 --> 16:52.147
an unlimited supply
of semen? Yeah.

16:52.316 --> 16:55.120
<i>I basically offered them a deal
where, if I could get</i>

16:55.205 --> 16:57.511
Nandor and Laszlo's...

16:58.363 --> 17:00.448
seed, willingly,

17:00.533 --> 17:02.290
<i>then in return,
I would get three percent</i>

17:02.375 --> 17:03.331
<i>of the net profit.</i>

17:03.416 --> 17:06.135
I call this Memo's Man Milk.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.404
Love it.

17:07.489 --> 17:08.829
Memo's short for Guillermo.

17:08.914 --> 17:11.328
<i>No more kidnappings
or surgical</i>

17:11.413 --> 17:13.598
<i>extractions,
and it's not like there's</i>

17:13.684 --> 17:15.897
not enough to go around.
That stuff is everywhere.

17:16.007 --> 17:18.536
I also included Colin Robinson
in the deal,

17:18.621 --> 17:21.316
which they replied
and said "No."

17:22.027 --> 17:23.778
Yeah, I've always been good
at puzzles.

17:23.862 --> 17:26.551
At the 1992
World Puzzle Championship,

17:26.637 --> 17:29.755
I told New York Times
puzzle master Will Shortz

17:29.840 --> 17:30.825
to "eat my shorts."

17:30.910 --> 17:32.161
What the hell?

17:32.246 --> 17:33.614
Who the hell has done all this?

17:33.698 --> 17:34.544
What the...?

17:34.629 --> 17:36.434
My pillows.

17:37.248 --> 17:39.093
What is that sound?

17:39.178 --> 17:41.833
I think it's coming
from down the hall.

17:41.918 --> 17:43.715
- Oh.
- It's the bloody goat.

17:43.918 --> 17:45.894
Wait. Does he live here now?

17:45.979 --> 17:48.036
- Oh, no!
- Did you do this?

17:48.121 --> 17:49.504
Get out of here!

17:49.588 --> 17:52.786
- Oh, no! - Begone!
- Shoo! Naughty goat.

17:52.871 --> 17:55.038
I know where you live,
asshole.

18:00.230 --> 18:02.215
- What are you up to?
- Oh, nothing much.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.230
You?

18:03.315 --> 18:05.113
Relegated to the
coffin in the basement.

18:05.198 --> 18:07.207
Ah. Tough break.

18:07.324 --> 18:09.124
- You still, uh...
- Terribly.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.777
- You?
- Full blazes.

18:15.147 --> 18:16.544
Look, I was thinking that...

18:16.629 --> 18:18.988
That we should finish each other
off and tell no one?

18:19.269 --> 18:21.168
Well, I'm game if you are.

18:26.643 --> 18:28.589
<i>I saved the
day when no one else could.</i>

18:28.681 --> 18:30.925
- Knock, knock.
<i>- Oh, hey there.</i>

18:31.018 --> 18:34.144
<i>But I will always
be "just a familiar" to them.</i>

18:34.293 --> 18:37.285
<i>I'm just another schlub
driving around Brooklyn</i>

18:37.371 --> 18:39.224
<i>with a bunch of jars full
of semen.</i>

18:39.309 --> 18:42.395
- Another delivery?
- Yeah. How about you?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.161
- Guard duty.
- Cool, cool.

18:44.246 --> 18:46.286
It isn't easy for guys like us.

18:46.371 --> 18:48.348
Well, technically,
you're not a guy, so...

18:48.488 --> 18:52.201
I mean, just hanging around for
years doing all the shit work.

18:52.574 --> 18:55.404
Sometimes I wonder
if they'll ever make me a witch.

18:55.550 --> 18:56.972
Yeah.

18:57.290 --> 18:59.177
Anyways, I got to go,
Black Peter, okay?

18:59.262 --> 19:00.832
- I'll see you later.
- Later.

19:02.222 --> 19:05.514
<i>♪♪ Gather up the dill
and the thyme and the walnuts ♪♪</i>

19:05.598 --> 19:09.895
<i>♪♪ The fennel and the sage and
