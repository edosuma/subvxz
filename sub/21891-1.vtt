00:55.889 --> 00:58.882
<i>So, what can I tell you about Eve Wilde</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:00.800
<i>that you don't already know?</i>

01:00.936 --> 01:03.053
Well, for starters, she absolutely hates

01:03.230 --> 01:06.519
being called Grandma or Grandmother
or anything with "grand" in it.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.563
So she's just plain old Eve
to both you and me.

01:10.028 --> 01:15.319
Oh, you probably do know
she's been married before, right?

01:15.826 --> 01:19.285
<i>But the only one you really need
to pay attention to is Laurence,</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.621
<i>husband number one
and my personal favorite</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:25.207
<i>because he is technically my grandpa,
but guess what.</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:29.580
I can't call him that either. Actors.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.581
<i>Eve and Laurence met in New York</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:35.051
<i>where Laurence was studying
to be a famous actor.</i>

01:36.346 --> 01:38.133
<i>And Eve wanted to be an actress,</i>

01:38.265 --> 01:41.975
<i>but, well, you know
how that old chestnut goes.</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:45.140
<i>Life's what happens
while you're busy making plans.</i>

01:46.064 --> 01:48.852
<i>Laurence got cast
as the lead in this big comedy.</i>

01:48.984 --> 01:52.227
<i>and he got Eve a part in it too,
which was super cool of him.</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:57.949
<i>But when the film came out, all of the
reviews said, "Hello. A star is born."</i>

01:58.076 --> 02:00.489
<i>But they weren't talking about Laurence.</i>

02:01.580 --> 02:04.539
<i>By the time Eve was
one of the biggest stars in the world,</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:08.205
<i>she and Laurence were exchanging
humorous divorce gifts.</i>

02:08.336 --> 02:11.044
<i>A silver cowbell for Eve
to wear around her neck</i>

02:11.173 --> 02:13.290
<i>so Laurence would always know
she was coming.</i>

02:13.425 --> 02:17.840
<i>A birdcage for Laurence so that
the next Mrs. Darling couldn't get away.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:21.806
I'd say Eve is on the whole
what you'd call a positive person.

02:21.933 --> 02:26.098
She says that her whole life has been
one long fairy tale and everything.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.222
But I might just disagree with Eve here.

02:29.358 --> 02:33.227
I might say in everything except love,

02:33.362 --> 02:38.653
which, frankly, if you knew the family
would be considered the family "hurdle."

02:39.826 --> 02:42.034
But all that was about to change.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.957
<i>Like the lightning
that precedes thunder,</i>

02:48.085 --> 02:52.045
my eyes took in what my heart knew
an instant later,

02:52.172 --> 02:53.959
that this was love.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.425
Love at first sight.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.064
<i>So I'm making a film
for Eve of the weekend.</i>

03:12.192 --> 03:13.649
<i>It's my wedding gift.</i>

03:13.777 --> 03:15.268
<i>And from prior experience,</i>

03:15.404 --> 03:18.988
<i>I can say it'll have
a little bit of all the genres:</i>

03:19.116 --> 03:21.984
<i>comedy, drama, musical
and, of course,</i>

03:22.119 --> 03:24.202
<i>documentary, which is my forte</i>

03:24.329 --> 03:26.912
<i>because I like to think
I ask the tough questions.</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:31.080
I bet it was the Swedish nanny
who jumped you when you were, like, 16.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.998
- Excuse me?
- Mom told me.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.838
She said that girl
was totally your type. Bad girl.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.959
Oh, my God.
Mackenzie, that is so inappropriate.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.051
Come on,
it was the Swedish nanny, right?

03:41.179 --> 03:44.468
Actually, my first love was...

03:45.475 --> 03:47.558
My first love...

03:48.395 --> 03:51.183
<i>OK, so he's doing
this whole drum-roll thing</i>

03:51.314 --> 03:53.806
<i>because deep down,
he wants to say it was my mom,</i>

03:53.942 --> 03:57.310
<i>but instead he's just trying to think
of something funny.</i>

03:57.487 --> 04:00.651
<i>That's my mom and dad
in this band they had.</i>

04:00.782 --> 04:04.571
<i>Mom said there were a lot of guys
trying to get her attention,</i>

04:04.703 --> 04:07.286
<i>but she only had eyes for him.</i>

04:07.414 --> 04:11.624
<i>She said he wrote the most dreamy music.</i>

04:11.752 --> 04:14.961
<i>Thing is, he still does,
just not for her.</i>

04:16.839 --> 04:21.709
My first love was a crème brûlée

04:21.845 --> 04:24.633
that I had in the south of France
when I was 12.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.802
You're so emotionally retarded, Dad.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.344
Thank you.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.013
Alright, hang on.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.228
<i>- Hey, Jimmy.
- I'm patching Ethan in.</i>

04:32.355 --> 04:34.062
<i>- OK.
- But I got everything.</i>

04:34.191 --> 04:36.774
All of Harold's numbers,
bank accounts, loans, debts...

04:36.902 --> 04:40.646
<i>My Uncle Jimmy has fallen
in love, like, a gazillion times.</i>

04:40.781 --> 04:42.443
<i>He says he's a romantic.</i>

04:43.033 --> 04:44.149
<i>- Look.
- Jimmy?</i>

04:44.284 --> 04:45.946
<i>There he goes again.</i>

04:46.077 --> 04:48.615
<i>Jimmy? Jimmy, you there?</i>

04:48.747 --> 04:52.957
<i>- Sorry. What? Sorry. Where was I?
- Having your suspicions confirmed.</i>

04:53.084 --> 04:56.998
Right, confirming my suspicion
that people who write serious novels

04:57.130 --> 04:59.372
have a relatively small pot to piss in.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.875
- Which is why this fucking prenup is...
- Dad.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.592
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Dad.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.632
Your bus is very late.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.973
Yeah, I know. I was on it.
Dad, this is Pink.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.018
- Pink?
- Hey, dude.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.850
She's coming with us for the weekend.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.894
Well, honey, it's kind of
a special weekend, don't you think?

05:18.026 --> 05:19.608
I brought a friend to her last wedding.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.647
But you were five.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.188
I brought a friend to your last wedding.
Thanks, babe.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.191
Please, I finally erased
that whole debacle from my memory.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.693
- Where's the car?
- Right there.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.070
Come on.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.580
Hello? Where the hell's Ethan?

05:37.003 --> 05:41.293
<i>My Uncle Ethan
says he's never getting married.</i>

05:42.592 --> 05:46.302
Oh, fuck! My God! Ah!

05:48.223 --> 05:51.307
<i>He says why would he,
with all the interesting people</i>

05:51.434 --> 05:53.221
<i>he meets on social media these days?</i>

05:53.395 --> 05:55.478
Good boy, Yoyo. Good boy.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.811
Oh, hey, Guy. Yeah.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.026
You heard the new tracks? OK.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.691
I'm gonna have the number-one
album and the number-one tour

06:04.865 --> 06:06.447
if you pull your finger out of your ass.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.237
Do your job. I want arenas.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.657
- Oh, honey, look. Look.
- No. Mom, please.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.577
Yes, yes, yes. Hey, can you pull over?
Yes, yes, right here.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.460
<i>The problem is
that when it comes to relationships,</i>

06:19.588 --> 06:20.795
<i>examples have to be set.</i>

06:21.464 --> 06:23.330
<i>But in my case, the adults setting them</i>

06:23.466 --> 06:26.959
<i>are quite possibly
the worst examples known to man.</i>

06:30.056 --> 06:32.844
Mom, Mom,
that slope near the boathouse.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.806
Somebody's gonna go ass over backwards
into a lawsuit.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.680
Well, it leads down to the lake.
I don't want to board it up.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.398
Well, can we at least put up
a couple of signs?

06:41.526 --> 06:46.567
Al, could you make up a couple of signs
that say "Beware of Steep Slope"?

06:46.698 --> 06:47.734
- A sign?
- Hello?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.279
A sign's gonna save us
a million dollars if someone falls.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.446
- We're in here.
- Mom.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.535
Hi.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.699
Sam.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.661
Sam can't pass a vintage clothing store
without begging me to stop.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.909
- Hello, darling.
- What's up, buddy?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.913
- That's for you.
- Come sit down.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.506
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

07:05.634 --> 07:09.127
Sam, just do what I do.
Donate all the clothes Mom gives me.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.096
I think your mother
has a charming fashion sense.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.215
- So do I.
- This is lovely.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.432
Yeah.

07:16.144 --> 07:20.855
- Sam. Tell me, how is your father?
- He's in Miami.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.937
- Yeah. Sebastian and I broke up.
- Why?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.194
Well, you know, it was either that
or I was gonna strangle him.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.188
Sure, the go-to options.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.699
<i>- So, Eve...
- Mm-hm.</i>

07:32.827 --> 07:35.319
What can you tell us
about your first love?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.293
Oh.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.881
There was a beautiful boy, Cosmo.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.877
He was the reason I joined
the theater class where I met Laurence.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.179
Of course,
Cosmo wasn't interested in girls.

07:54.349 --> 07:57.683
Yeah, duh. Of course. His name is Cosmo.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.933
Alright, so... so, what,
your first love was Laurence?

08:03.608 --> 08:07.318
I remember the first time
Laurence and I rehearsed.

08:07.445 --> 08:13.407
He looked at me
with that smoldering stare that he has.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.618
I mean, you know. You know the one.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.037
I know it well.

08:19.165 --> 08:23.876
And it was goodbye, Cosmo,
hello, Laurence.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.849
<i>Now, of course,
Laurence has had the career</i>

08:38.977 --> 08:41.219
<i>every actor would dream of having,</i>

08:41.354 --> 08:43.971
<i>unless, of course,
you're Laurence Darling.</i>

08:44.357 --> 08:47.896
<i>He's recognized as a great actor.</i>

08:49.029 --> 08:53.820
<i>I'm just a... a simple movie star.</i>

08:53.950 --> 08:57.910
<i>And he could find that very annoying.</i>

09:06.212 --> 09:08.295
- Morning.
- Morning.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.822
- Boys, boys, boys.
- Dad.

09:34.949 --> 09:39.114
It's so good to see you.
Why isn't it more often?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.578
- You never return any of our calls.
- Dad, Dad, Dad.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.323
It was a rhetorical question, James.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.951
We all have such busy lives now.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.371
- Laurence.
- The Lady Eve.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.591
- How are you?
- I am grand.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.550
I have come to see you off again.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.431
Maybe we'll get it right this time.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.848
That's why I'm here,
to make sure that this one is a keeper.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.891
You are so thoughtful.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.640
As if you'd have any idea
what a keeper was.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.440
- Laurence.
- I'm sensing a theme here.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.273
Are all the exes invited?

10:17.408 --> 10:20.492
- Just the ones Mom likes.
- And they're still alive.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.613
Well, I'm glad I still qualify.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.990
Has the great man arrived?

10:26.126 --> 10:30.211
Not yet. His sense of timing's
even better than yours.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.708
Upstaged again?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.464
<i>- Bad Girls.
- Uh...</i>

10:41.599 --> 10:44.307
<i>Right. Uh, Bad Girls, Bad Girls.</i>

10:44.435 --> 10:47.018
Dad, come on.
It was one of her biggest hits.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.263
Oh, yeah, got it.

10:48.398 --> 10:53.189
Uh, Eve steals into a prison...
an Indonesian prison

10:53.319 --> 10:55.811
to save her daughter
who's wrongly accused of murder.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.322
OK, and it ends...?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.190
Oh, f... Um...

11:01.202 --> 11:03.194
Hang on just a minute. Uh...

11:03.329 --> 11:08.620
Oh, yes, uh, it turns out
the daughter actually did it,

11:08.751 --> 11:10.834
but Eve takes her place
on the scaffold anyway.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.954
<i>Actually, it's a rip-off
of Tale of Two Cities.</i>

11:13.089 --> 11:15.297
Dad, I think it's very romantic

11:15.425 --> 11:17.257
that you're going to all this effort.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.844
- Thank you, Clemmie.
- Romantic?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.176
It's an absolute bloody miracle.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.736
Dad?

11:44.787 --> 11:45.823
Dad.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.952
I'm sorry.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.179
It's a big day here.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.054
- Waiting for Harold.
- It's a very good day.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.143
Harold, man. Oh.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.517
Mum. Mummy.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.981
Hey, hey, hey.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.437
Here they come. Here they come.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.185
He's going around the wrong way.

12:21.324 --> 12:24.032
Alright, everyone, behave, behave.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.360
Our new family.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.453
Four.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.324
Welcome! Welcome!

12:33.711 --> 12:35.543
And there's number five.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.123
Oh!

12:39.300 --> 12:42.088
Right. This is my daughter, Clemmie.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.507
Hello, Clemmie.
I've heard so much about you.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.881
- My daughter, Rose.
- Rose, yes.

12:47.016 --> 12:51.807
And this is Rose's friend
and almost third daughter.

12:51.938 --> 12:52.974
- Hello.
- Saffron.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.313
Saffron. Hi.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.648
Come meet my family.
There's Jimmy, my oldest.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.812
- Hey, Jimmy.
- James.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.943
- And then Rory.
- Hi, Rory.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.479
- Ethan.
- Ethan.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.606
Back there with the camera
is Mackenzie,

13:03.741 --> 13:07.485
whose mother is Priscilla
who was married to Rory.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.452
Here's Sam.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.164
You are doing...? Hi.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.376
- My daughter, Mackenzie.
- Hi.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.787
- Hi, Mackenzie.
- Hi.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.089
My nephew, Dylan.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.506
My brother's son,
who sadly couldn't be here. And...

13:24.637 --> 13:25.673
- You are who?
- Dylan.

13:25.805 --> 13:30.596
- Dylan, hi.
- And Laurence, the father of my sons.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.721
And husband number one.
What a great pleasure. I am a big fan.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.813
The pleasure is all mine.
I'm a bigger fan.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.442
So you guys are in here.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.686
Oh, thank you very much.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.399
<i>According to Wikipedia,</i>

13:43.531 --> 13:48.526
<i>"Harold Alcott writes novels about love
that are tragically comedic."</i>

13:49.454 --> 13:52.572
<i>Which means he's gonna fit right in
with this family.</i>

13:52.707 --> 13:54.949
- I missed you.
- Well, that's your fault.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.871
It's because you have
so many books to pack.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.369
Well, I'm a writer.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.835
Just as long as you have that book
with the pictures that we like.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.332
Oh.

14:03.468 --> 14:07.428
The Pompeiian bathhouses.
Yeah, those saucy Romans.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.263
I brought it in my hand luggage.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.175
Get off.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.140
Stop it.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.473
Oh.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.110
Did the cat get the cream?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.274
- What cream?
- Silver fox.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.398
Major hottie. For an old guy.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.150
Oh, you know, hang on here, you guys.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.949
You make me sound so... so superficial,

14:33.081 --> 14:35.824
like it's all about
his, granted, good looks

14:35.958 --> 14:39.577
and not about his big...
whoopee-doo-doo.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.589
Do I really have to hear this?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.709
Did I wanna hear about you and Priscilla
and the best sex of all time?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.131
Hey, hey, hey. I never said that.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.304
- Really?
- Really?

14:51.432 --> 14:54.266
Do not repeat that to Mackenzie. Do not.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.764
It wasn't the greatest sex of my life.
It was the greatest sex of his.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.105
Seriously?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.233
Hello?

15:09.200 --> 15:13.695
Hello? Hi, yes. I'm trying to track down
an employee of yours.

15:13.830 --> 15:18.074
She drove the Montauk bus yesterday
that arrived at 11:45.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.700
Actually, I say it arrived at 11:45,

15:19.877 --> 15:22.540
but in point of fact
it was very, very late.

15:22.672 --> 15:26.006
Why do I wish to contact her?
Is that any business of yours?

15:26.843 --> 15:30.507
I mean, I could be an estate attorney.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.216
So what does marriage mean to you?

15:36.352 --> 15:38.810
What's your experience with that?

15:41.357 --> 15:43.098
Uh, well...

15:44.777 --> 15:48.236
My... My parents fighting.
People getting divorced.

15:48.364 --> 15:53.701
Whoa, OK. You're being a little bit
of a Debbie Downer here, alright?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.706
What about first love?

16:00.751 --> 16:03.414
What's...
What's your experience with that?

16:03.546 --> 16:09.087
First love?
Let me give that some thought.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.843
Dylan, Dylan, I'm still filming.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.433
<i>Dylan.</i>

16:18.561 --> 16:20.848
<i>Girls, you know that crazy,
warm sensation you get</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:23.188
<i>when you cross your legs
and squeeze really tight?</i>

16:24.233 --> 16:25.895
Well, the first time I had that,

16:26.027 --> 16:28.440
<i>the weirdo in me
was thinking about D ylan.</i>

16:29.655 --> 16:32.819
<i>But what would, o f course,
get tongues wagging around these parts</i>

16:32.992 --> 16:36.110
is that Dylan and I

16:36.245 --> 16:40.239
are technically first cousins,

16:40.374 --> 16:43.742
but first cousins once removed,
so there's, like, a three percent chance

16:43.878 --> 16:46.541
our kids would have, like,
15 fingers and three eyes.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.966
OK, the first-love question
was a bit leading

16:55.097 --> 16:57.259
as Dylan and I have already kissed,

16:57.391 --> 17:01.931
<i>but it was last summer
and I haven't even seen him since.</i>

17:03.731 --> 17:07.098
Anyway, just...
it raises that age-old question.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.527
You know, can you ever go back?

17:11.155 --> 17:13.146
That's exactly what I was thinking,

17:13.281 --> 17:16.616
though I think maybe a couple more here,
possibly another hydrangea.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.493
I think that'd be very nice.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.907
The last thing
I would call either of us is selfish.

17:24.085 --> 17:27.624
In fact, the term "generous to a fault"
springs to mind.

17:27.755 --> 17:31.089
But in this instance,
I suggest we put it to the vote

17:31.217 --> 17:34.801
to keep our one solitary decanter
of liquid nectar

17:34.929 --> 17:38.343
<i>a secret from the vin ordinaire drinkers</i>

17:38.474 --> 17:41.842
<i>and rendezvous back here
après le diner.</i>

17:42.770 --> 17:45.604
I second that motion and say aye.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.188
Aye.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.933
Harold and I will meet you back here.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.112
Yes, Harold.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.157
He's a fine-wine man, is he?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.711
So are you happy?

18:51.839 --> 18:54.331
Go on, say it,
and I'll tell you what I think.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.469
I think you're a liar.

19:00.723 --> 19:04.683
Me? I'm fine.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.642
- Hey.
- I'm fine.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.433
Hey.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.647
Moving right along.

19:12.151 --> 19:16.145
In fact, you know what?
You know what I feel like doing?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.943
I feel like making love right now.

19:21.202 --> 19:27.244
I want a man to devour me

19:27.375 --> 19:30.334
and kiss every inch of my naked body

19:30.461 --> 19:33.204
until I am begging him
to fuck me hard.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.422
How do you feel about that?

19:35.591 --> 19:39.084
Well, guess what.
I'm looking at a guy right now.

19:39.220 --> 19:43.260
And I can tell from his shit-eating grin
that he'll be happy to oblige.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.761
Ciao.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.180
Sorry. Grandma.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.395
<i>It will probably surprise you to learn</i>

19:50.523 --> 19:53.812
<i>that Ethan speaks five languages,
Portuguese among them.</i>

19:53.943 --> 19:58.734
<i>So he understood every word of Saf f ron's
phone call to her, quote, "grandma,"</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:01.026
<i>and explains the grin
she was referring to.</i>

20:01.158 --> 20:03.024
How about we go on a little ride?

20:03.160 --> 20:07.325
I got some delicious magic mushroom
chocolates. You up for it?

20:07.456 --> 20:10.073
Mmm. Very naughty.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.041
Half will get you really high. Easy.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.761
Aah!

20:39.280 --> 20:40.111
Whoo!

21:05.014 --> 21:06.380
To you.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.926
Cheers.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.560
Mmm.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.948
So how's it going
with the young actress?

21:25.117 --> 21:28.781
Young is a relative term. She's 36.

21:28.913 --> 21:32.077
She went back to her boyfriend,
at my suggestion, of course.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.042
They're getting married.
Must be catching.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.536
I'll probably be
at that wedding as well.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.750
Ah, so that leaves
a position to be filled.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.756
Mmm.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.092
Already filled.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.342
So, tell me, am I giving you away
for good this time?

21:54.146 --> 21:56.513
Harold is an extraordinary man.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.813
That he is, but will he understand
your way of thinking?

22:00.569 --> 22:02.435
I don't think that way anymore.

22:02.571 --> 22:06.906
Fame, success, the flattery.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.283
I'll leave it all to you.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.494
Thank you. I'll take it.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.289
Very generous of you.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.498
Eve didn't tell you I was coming, huh?

22:19.630 --> 22:21.121
Oh, I wonder why.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.340
Maybe she thought
you'd have a problem with it.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.133
- Oh, hey.
- What's up, guys?

22:25.261 --> 22:27.423
- Hey.
- Wear less.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.137
OK, that happened. Um...

22:29.265 --> 22:35.102
Look, a rock 'n' roll tour is not
a place for a 16-year-old girl. Come on.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.436
Well, why don't you come?

22:36.564 --> 22:40.558
Oh, sure. What, now that Sebastian
is no longer needed?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.309
- Sure.
- Oh, honey.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.232
- What?
- I think I'd rather be dead.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.152
- Shit. OK, good night.
- OK, good night.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.406
Alright, now, who's shaggable?

23:37.541 --> 23:44.664
I don't know. I can't decide
between the beautiful 17-year-old boy...

23:44.798 --> 23:46.915
You cradle robber.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.299
Saff.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.714
...or the naughty 30-something-year-old

23:50.846 --> 23:53.179
that you were tarting around with
last night.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.550
He's much more up your alley.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.053
- Right.
- He's all yours. How about you, Clem?

24:00.189 --> 24:04.149
Why would I tell you,
Tweedleslap and Tweedleslapper?

24:04.276 --> 24:07.189
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, Clem!

24:10.658 --> 24:12.524
- Dad.
- Yeah?

24:12.660 --> 24:14.777
Eve's one and only Golden Globe

24:14.912 --> 24:18.747
<i>was for, A, Loves of a Blonde,</i>

24:18.874 --> 24:21.912
<i>or, B, Blonde Love?</i>

24:22.836 --> 24:24.919
<i>Uh... Loves of a Blonde.</i>

24:25.047 --> 24:27.130
Uh, wrong.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.546
<i>It was actually for Blind Lover.</i>

24:30.678 --> 24:33.716
That's a trick question.
That's not fair.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.100
An early wedding present.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.476
What is it?

24:40.604 --> 24:41.811
I got sent this the other day

24:41.939 --> 24:44.977
and they want the two of us to be in it
playing mother and son.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.475
That's imaginative casting.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.444
It's actually a really good script.
You should think about doing it.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.525
I'm in a wheelchair.
You end up in a wheelchair.

24:51.699 --> 24:54.191
Last scene is the two of us
dancing in wheelchairs.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.945
- A lot of crying scenes.
- Really? I'm retired. You do it.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.493
- It's a both-or-nothing deal.
- Oh.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.409
- Will you at least read it?
- Oh, honey.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.833
Come on, on your honeymoon.
Gotta get out of bed sometime.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.503
- Bow-chicka-wawa.
- That is so bad. You are my son.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.626
- Where are you guys going?
- Venice.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.424
- That's original.
- Well, it was Harold's idea.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.718
I didn't wanna start off
as a difficult wife.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.974
Then don't be a difficult mother.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.314
OK, Eve and Harold's wedding song,
take one.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.271
I think it's very adult of you
to be this civilized.

26:49.399 --> 26:53.143
I mean, not everyone would have
their ex-husband at their wedding.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.612
My mum would turn into the Exorcist
if Dad showed up at her wedding.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.106
Oh, God.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.201
Projectile green vomit.
Head 360. The whole thing.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.240
She still really hates him.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.614
Dare one ask why?

27:05.749 --> 27:09.288
Oh, well, um,
as Dorothy Parker once said,

27:09.461 --> 27:11.623
"Hogamous, Higamous,
Man is polygamous

27:11.755 --> 27:14.498
Higamous, Hogamous,
Woman is monogamous."

27:18.011 --> 27:20.128
Um, I doubt Dorothy Parker
actually said that.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.722
Yes, it has a man's fingerprints
all over it.

27:22.850 --> 27:25.593
Yes, it sounds
suspiciously self-serving.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.844
You know,
if it helps explain anything, Rose,

27:27.980 --> 27:31.348
Mom and Dad here
were like the poster couple for divorce.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.816
Yeah, they gave each other
divorce gifts.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.276
Really? What?

27:35.404 --> 27:37.737
- I've forgotten.
- Me too.

27:37.865 --> 27:41.825
Actually, one time, Mom took the three
of us out of the country for a vacation

27:41.952 --> 27:43.568
and she didn't get Dad's permission.

27:43.704 --> 27:47.698
Dad waited patiently until we got back
and then had Mom arrested at the airport

27:47.833 --> 27:49.290
and put in prison for the night.

27:49.418 --> 27:50.784
What a guy.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.080
Character building.

27:52.254 --> 27:55.167
And when Dad came back after having
been away working for three months,

27:55.299 --> 27:57.791
he found that Mom
had completely redecorated the suite

27:57.926 --> 27:59.383
and put it on the bill.

27:59.553 --> 28:02.136
Yes, it was much more cheerful.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.281
Hello, there!

28:28.498 --> 28:30.160
<i>- Hey! Hombre!
- Ah!</i>

28:30.292 --> 28:31.624
My best man.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.210
<i>- Cómo está?
- Oh, muy bien. Usted?</i>

28:34.338 --> 28:35.954
<i>Bien, bien, bien.</i>

28:36.131 --> 28:37.463
Hey.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.082
<i>Bienvenido.</i>

28:39.259 --> 28:40.625
<i>- Señor.
- Cómo estás?</i>

28:41.303 --> 28:43.795
I just think we have to make
at least one attempt

28:43.931 --> 28:45.467
to get Mom to do a prenup.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.680
I don't know. She's done
quite well for herself so far.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.770
Yeah, but so far
all of her husbands have had money.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.726
Except for you.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.357
- Of course.
- Yeah.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.321
Come on!

29:07.829 --> 29:11.197
So what does true love
mean to you, Mother?

29:11.333 --> 29:13.950
True love? Um...

29:14.753 --> 29:19.965
Well, you know, if at first
you don't succeed, try, try again.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.880
Which is what I keep saying
about those songs, Mom.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.261
- What songs?
- Your new ones.

29:26.056 --> 29:29.345
<i>What do you know, anyway?
You... You sing along with Les Mis.</i>

29:32.062 --> 29:34.349
Mommy is a rock goddess.

29:34.523 --> 29:37.106
Mom... Mommy is a rock goddess.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.404
A couple of my novels
that were turned into films

29:46.535 --> 29:49.027
sent me to bed with a bottle of Scotch.

29:50.622 --> 29:55.834
Well, that's where the films I'm usually
in these days always send me.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.453
And why I'm in graceful retirement.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.706
Yeah, but that is such a pity, Eve.

30:01.842 --> 30:05.006
- You played some great roles.
- Has she... She has.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.504
Harold has seen all my work.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.845
You've seen all of Eve's films?

30:12.477 --> 30:14.764
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

30:14.896 --> 30:18.139
Uh... well, you know, nearly all.

30:18.317 --> 30:22.778
And which performance
do you treasure the most?

30:24.781 --> 30:30.322
Well, I'd have to say, um... it was
the first time I saw you on screen.

30:30.454 --> 30:36.121
You were playing a waitress in a diner
who kept getting the orders wrong

30:36.251 --> 30:39.961
and you nearly killed this poor guy
who had a nut allergy.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.171
It was hilarious.

30:42.758 --> 30:46.468
<i>Available Man.
Laurence got me that part.</i>

30:46.595 --> 30:52.341
Yes, I also played the guy
with the nut allergy.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.014
Though that wasn't
Eve's first leading role.

30:55.145 --> 30:58.138
It was meant to be, anyways, supporting.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.684
Well, obviously, yes.

30:59.816 --> 31:03.435
Um, in a leading role,

31:03.570 --> 31:09.532
<i>I would have to say, um... uh...
Bad Girls was very moving.</i>

31:11.119 --> 31:12.781
Mmm.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.697
Mmm.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.869
Mmm.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.580
Mmm.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.171
Look, it doesn't have to be perfect.
Can you get a prenup here by tomorrow?

31:24.925 --> 31:29.465
Dance party. Here we go.
Taking us down the road. Let's do it.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.927
Step, and down.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.099
Step.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.399
Step, step. Clap, clap.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.363
Work it, girl. Work it.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.194
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Oh, come on. You can get this.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.072
- Take off! These are our tarts!
- Get outta here.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.954
OK, again.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.999
Go. Get down.

32:05.715 --> 32:08.628
Do you really think
he's seen all your films?

32:08.760 --> 32:12.800
Of course not. But I think
it's sweet that he pretends he has.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.220
- And you never miss it?
- Oh, God, no.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.645
We always did it for different reasons.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.186
- We did?
- Yeah.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.185
You did it, well, you still do it,

32:27.320 --> 32:29.528
for the work,
for the challenge of the work,

32:29.656 --> 32:32.649
for the absences the work affords.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.151
I always thought of the family
as integral to my work

32:35.287 --> 32:37.825
and you thought of it
as detrimental to your work.

32:37.956 --> 32:38.992
Did I?

32:39.166 --> 32:41.123
Speaking about
mixing family and work,

32:41.251 --> 32:44.085
Ethan has this movie
he wants me to act in with him.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.669
Good part?

32:47.090 --> 32:49.298
A mother in a wheelchair, apparently.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.634
Mmm.

32:51.761 --> 32:55.220
Do you think it could be changed
to a father in a wheelchair?

32:55.348 --> 32:57.055
Possible Oscar bait.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.597
"He walks away with it.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.562
I'm supporting."

33:02.689 --> 33:05.397
- "I'm supporting."
- "I'm supporting."

33:05.525 --> 33:10.520
"We start out supporting
and we end up supporting."

33:36.973 --> 33:37.929
Hi.

33:38.058 --> 33:42.268
Hello. Tomas,
ask her who the cute boy is.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.187
My sister wants to know
who Harry Potter is.

33:45.315 --> 33:46.772
Who?

33:48.485 --> 33:50.226
That's Dylan.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.945
He's your boyfriend?

33:53.073 --> 33:54.564
- He's my cousin.
- Ah.

33:54.699 --> 33:55.940
What did she say?

33:56.076 --> 33:59.069
His name's Dylan.
He's not her boyfriend. He's her cousin.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.866
Oh, good. I'll go over.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.829
My sister says, "Oh, good."

34:02.958 --> 34:04.415
Good?

34:06.586 --> 34:10.876
Um, he's actually my first cousin...
He's my first cousin once removed.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.043
- I don't understand her.
- I think she likes Harry Potter.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.257
But he's her cousin.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.473
That's disgusting.
They'll have children with 15 fingers.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.434
No, he's her second cousin,
so they'll probably have normal fingers.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.437
But they're cousins. I'm going.

34:29.693 --> 34:32.275
- Hello.
- Hi.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.612
- How are you?
- I'm good.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.362
So how old are you?

34:36.491 --> 34:38.574
<i>Oh, Girl At War.</i>

34:42.038 --> 34:43.074
OK.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.746
Do you need some help?

34:51.880 --> 34:52.917
Sure.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.292
But first I have to confess something.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.839
OK.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.765
<i>I had my first serious snog to
Up All Night In The Diner With Julie.</i>

35:02.892 --> 35:07.102
Snog. That's...
That's English for "make out," right?

35:07.230 --> 35:09.267
Yes, but with lots and lots of tongue.

35:09.441 --> 35:13.981
Alright, well, that was a...
that was a great choice to, uh, snog to.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.525
- It was amazing.
- I'm glad to hear it.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.358
So, being a bit of a fan,
can I ask you three questions?

35:20.493 --> 35:22.610
Alright. Go for it.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.197
Why did you stop writing?

35:30.086 --> 35:31.418
Who said I stopped?

35:33.256 --> 35:35.339
Right. OK.

35:36.551 --> 35:40.340
- Why did you leave your band?
- Oh, it was never really my band.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.462
It was our band.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.591
But, you know, you got a lead singer
with a huge personality.

35:44.726 --> 35:48.219
It was always gonna be her band
in the end. I mean, rightly so.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.438
And is that why you left?

35:51.691 --> 35:53.774
No, honestly, I, uh...

35:55.153 --> 35:57.440
You know, that whole
rock 'n' roll lifestyle thing,

35:57.572 --> 36:01.407
it just... wasn't that important.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.326
Not fame or money?

36:04.454 --> 36:08.698
No, it's not everything.
I mean, I figured that out pretty early.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.754
OK, uh, I have two questions.

36:14.881 --> 36:18.340
- Oh. Really?
- Yes, I do.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.050
What is an Orange Prize?

36:20.553 --> 36:24.342
- Oh, my God, you googled me.
- No, please.

36:24.474 --> 36:27.057
No, Eve told me
one of Harold's daughters was a novelist

36:27.185 --> 36:29.768
and it's obviously not Rose.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.388
She said that an Orange Prize
had been won.

36:32.899 --> 36:36.939
An Orange Prize is an award
they give to first-time female authors,

36:37.112 --> 36:40.150
and I didn't win, I was shortlisted.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.689
Congratulations.

36:41.825 --> 36:44.943
- Was it autobiographical?
- Why do you ask that?

36:45.078 --> 36:46.364
Oh, come on.

36:46.538 --> 36:51.454
It's about an older sister who's kind of
attractive in a bookish kind of way

36:51.584 --> 36:53.997
who lives with her hipster,
skirt-chasing dad

36:54.129 --> 36:58.123
and wild-child younger sister
and they all live on red wine and pizza?

36:58.258 --> 37:00.591
- You read it.
- Sure.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.006
Gotta check up on my new stepfamily.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.422
Some of it was me, yeah,
but most of it wasn't.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.676
- I can't actually cook a chicken Kiev.
- Not a problem.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.349
- But I do like books.
- Obviously.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.482
Do you know,
I would prefer if you referred to me

37:16.609 --> 37:19.568
as kind of sexy in a librarian way
rather than bookish.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.062
- You would prefer that?
- Yes.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.689
Well, you need glasses
for sexy librarian.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.088
Soul patch.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.545
<i>"Such duty
as the subject owes the prince,</i>

37:42.677 --> 37:45.090
<i>Even such a woman
oweth to her husband.</i>

37:45.221 --> 37:46.632
<i>And if she is froward,</i>

37:46.765 --> 37:51.806
peevish, sullen, sour,
and not obedient to his honest will,

37:51.936 --> 37:54.724
What is she
but a foul contending rebel

37:54.856 --> 37:58.691
And graceless traitor
to her loving lord?"

38:00.653 --> 38:03.270
I'm not just a fuckin' movie star.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.408
<i>It's Priscilla< for Guy.
No, I don't wanna hold.</i>

38:08.536 --> 38:10.152
<i>I don't wanna hold. I don't wanna hold.</i>

38:10.288 --> 38:12.450
Yeah. I wanna write a book.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.325
About me.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.586
You've never seen any of my films?

38:23.718 --> 38:25.084
I don't think so.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.382
Do you go to the theater?

38:27.514 --> 38:29.380
- What?
- Not if we can help it.

38:29.516 --> 38:33.180
Wait, hang on.
Were you in the last SpongeBob film?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.643
I was indeed.

38:34.771 --> 38:38.390
- Oh, my God. I love SpongeBob.
- Oh, yeah?

38:38.525 --> 38:41.609
You used to be quite good-looking.
You've put on some weight, though.

38:41.736 --> 38:46.026
- Come on, Saffie. Let's get a drinkie.
- Actually, I've lost weight.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.491
- What'd I miss?
- My whole career, apparently.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.402
- That's it. I'm moving out.
- What?

38:51.538 --> 38:54.451
You're killing me with the second-hand
smoke and you don't even care.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.996
I do care. But you're not dead yet.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.120
Go over there and have the fresh air.
Go on.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.214
Fifty bucks says Dad
brings up his Tony at dinner.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.334
No way.
Fifty it's before the main course.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.462
<i>A hundred it's before the salad
and he got it for Pirandello's Henry IV.</i>

39:09.597 --> 39:11.429
- That's bold.
- Watch and learn.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.135
- I'll take dessert.
- Alright, man.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.561
So wait, wait, wait.
You guys met in a jailhouse for women?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.681
It's actually a really good way
to meet people.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.941
Here we go, here we go.

39:23.152 --> 39:31.026
I, for one, would like to commend Eve
on her optimism and her perseverance

39:31.160 --> 39:33.573
and, of course, her courage...

39:33.705 --> 39:35.287
Ha-ha!

39:35.415 --> 39:38.783
...in taking this plunge yet again.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.376
- Brave girl.
- I must say, I was surprised.

39:41.504 --> 39:47.045
In fact, I would have wagered
my Tony Award for my performance

39:47.176 --> 39:50.669
<i>- in Pirandello's Henry IV...
- Bastard.</i>

39:50.805 --> 39:56.426
...against the idea that you would ever
tread down this path again, my darling.

39:56.561 --> 40:00.180
But having met Harold, I think I get it.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.477
To Eve and Harold.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.891
To Eve and Harold.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.272
- Harold.
- Here you go.

40:12.285 --> 40:15.323
So, lovebirds, hey.

40:15.455 --> 40:19.950
I... I know it's customary
to give the gifts after the wedding,

40:20.084 --> 40:22.747
but I really wanna give you my gift now.

40:22.879 --> 40:23.915
- Right now.
- Sure.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.755
- Love it.
- Cheers.

41:47.463 --> 41:48.795
That's your daughter.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.086
Hello. This is James Darling.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.876
I called yesterday trying to track down

42:32.008 --> 42:37.299
the young lady who drove the Montauk
bus that did not arrive at 11:45,

42:37.430 --> 42:40.047
and you asked me
why I wanted to contact her,

42:40.224 --> 42:45.936
and, well, the reason is when I saw her,

42:46.064 --> 42:49.228
in her not-very-flattering
jitney uniform, by the way,

42:49.358 --> 42:56.447
when I saw her, the little voice
in my head said, "This is the one."

42:56.574 --> 42:58.531
Ah, fuck!

42:58.659 --> 43:01.242
- Easy, man. I'm not a horse.
- What happened?

43:01.370 --> 43:03.657
- Gentle.
- Jimmy?

43:03.790 --> 43:04.826
Jimmy?

43:04.957 --> 43:11.124
Oh. I... I fucking tripped over
the "Beware of Slope" sign.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.676
- Oh, my God, that is too funny.
- Alright, Mom.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.928
It's just a grade-one ankle sprain.

43:20.056 --> 43:23.549
There's no sign
of anterior talofibular disruption.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.518
Really, that's
your professional diagnosis?

43:26.646 --> 43:28.012
It is indeed, James.

43:28.147 --> 43:32.482
One of the great things
about acting on the stage

43:32.610 --> 43:35.318
is that one gets to inhabit a role,

43:35.446 --> 43:41.158
and you might be aware that I have
rather famously played a doctor.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.277
Doctor Dolittle?

43:43.412 --> 43:45.028
And your point is?

43:45.164 --> 43:48.532
You bandaged the leg
of an animatronic giraffe,

43:48.668 --> 43:51.081
<i>singing "If I Could Talk
to the Animals"?</i>

43:51.254 --> 43:56.466
And I was complimented
on my technique by numerous physicians.

43:56.592 --> 43:57.628
Bravo.

44:00.263 --> 44:03.802
Actually, I would like
to compliment you, Laurence,

44:03.933 --> 44:07.017
on your very gracious toast.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.137
I meant every word I said.

44:09.272 --> 44:14.188
You are amazingly courageous,
amazingly tenacious

44:14.318 --> 44:17.811
and amazingly naive.

44:18.781 --> 44:19.942
Said the old cynic.

44:20.324 --> 44:22.691
Come on, Laurence,
what are you still holding out for?

44:22.827 --> 44:27.367
I'm not holding out.
I like my birdcage empty, thank you.

44:27.498 --> 44:32.209
Anyway, why would I want
a new wife and new family

44:32.336 --> 44:35.625
when I already have the best ex-wife

44:35.756 --> 44:39.340
and raised the most perfect family
any man could want?

44:39.468 --> 44:43.337
Oh, my God, Dad, you have lived
in a hotel suite for the last 30 years.

44:43.472 --> 44:44.929
With one fucking bedroom.

44:45.057 --> 44:47.515
When we wanted to see you,
we had to check in.

44:51.189 --> 44:54.307
<i>I think marriage
is challenging, formidable</i>

44:54.442 --> 44:58.311
<i>and to be taken very seriously,</i>

44:58.446 --> 45:01.780
<i>like a great heroic adventure.</i>

45:01.908 --> 45:05.242
<i>Captain Scott heading o ff
into the Antarctic.</i>

45:05.369 --> 45:07.452
<i>Does that make me the South Pole?</i>

45:09.248 --> 45:12.741
<i>Where I would be very happy
to plant my flag.</i>

45:29.143 --> 45:31.635
Yeah!

45:44.533 --> 45:46.616
Look at this one.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.666
See ya.

46:07.974 --> 46:10.341
You did remember the birdcage.

46:11.310 --> 46:17.056
How could I forget the best piece
of advice an ex-wife ever gave to a man?

46:17.191 --> 46:19.274
"You can't lock me up."

46:19.944 --> 46:22.061
Lock you up?

46:22.196 --> 46:24.939
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

46:25.950 --> 46:29.569
After all these years,
and you had no clue.

46:30.830 --> 46:34.665
- It's not about you.
- It's not? But I hate that.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.375
No, no, the birdcage

46:37.503 --> 46:41.087
was so you could keep
the next Mrs. Darling from flying away.

46:41.257 --> 46:43.340
Like the first one did.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.504
Oh.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.127
- It was?
- Yes.

46:47.263 --> 46:51.052
No, wait, I thought it was because,
you know, you can fly in,

46:51.183 --> 46:55.723
but then if you wanted to fly out, you
know, to meet up with other roosters...

46:55.896 --> 46:57.137
Oh!

47:03.529 --> 47:05.771
Hello, my lady. Where's Saffron?

47:05.906 --> 47:07.693
Gone inside.

47:12.705 --> 47:14.662
Homemade chocolates?

47:14.790 --> 47:17.453
They're super delicious
and a lot of fun.

47:19.045 --> 47:20.752
What sort of fun?

47:20.921 --> 47:23.504
Let's just say
they're in the 'shroom family.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.222
Wanna go for a moonlight ride?
Vroom, vroom!

47:36.354 --> 47:38.846
- Mm-hm.
- Hm?

47:38.981 --> 47:41.064
I'll go change.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.908
Do you know what's great about us?

47:53.662 --> 47:56.154
We've been through all the bad times.

47:57.666 --> 48:00.033
One of the benefits
of being apart so long

48:00.169 --> 48:05.130
is that somebody else
had to take the knockout punches.

48:07.385 --> 48:10.878
And on that note,
think I'll have another drink. Anyone?

48:11.347 --> 48:14.055
No, I won't.
I'm getting married in the morning.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.137
I should think about going to bed.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.472
The night is young.

48:25.611 --> 48:29.355
Eve and Laurence have
started in on the merits of marriage.

48:30.282 --> 48:33.070
It's funny how they didn't have
that conversation 30 years ago.

48:33.202 --> 48:34.534
Isn't it?

48:52.888 --> 48:56.222
- I think that's enough of that.
- Alright.

49:09.738 --> 49:10.774
Fuck.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.531
Fuck, fuck.

49:21.041 --> 49:22.077
<i>Have you ever thought</i>

49:22.209 --> 49:25.293
what might have happened
if you'd never gotten me that part?

49:25.421 --> 49:28.710
Yeah, I might have been mentioned
in one of the reviews.

49:29.884 --> 49:32.672
I meant what might
have happened with us.

49:35.181 --> 49:37.798
I don't know.
Would it have been different? Probably.

49:37.933 --> 49:42.143
Would it have been better?
I don't know. Better than this?

49:44.732 --> 49:48.100
What if Harold feels
there's no room for an ex-husband?

49:49.403 --> 49:51.520
There's always room.

49:51.655 --> 49:54.489
Ah, but maybe no more room for this.

49:58.204 --> 50:00.287
May I tempt you?

50:01.081 --> 50:04.245
I have a wedding dress to fit into.

50:10.341 --> 50:13.584
You're going to be
the most beautiful bride.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.393
Hmm.

50:26.398 --> 50:27.730
Psst. Hey.

50:28.943 --> 50:30.900
You wanna bake a cake?

50:31.654 --> 50:34.146
- OK.
- Fantastic. Let's go.

50:34.281 --> 50:35.522
Come on.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.238
Whoo!

50:41.580 --> 50:47.201
- You feel anything?
- Yeah. I feel fucking amazing!

50:47.336 --> 50:51.080
Alright, I will chop the mint,
you pick the tune.

50:51.215 --> 50:53.582
Music is important.

50:53.759 --> 50:55.876
So what are we actually doing here,
Gordon Ramsay?

50:56.011 --> 50:59.595
Are you familiar
with the chiffonade cut?

50:59.723 --> 51:02.010
No. What is it?

51:03.936 --> 51:07.020
Nice. Austrian Swing.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.764
Is that a lucky guess
or an excellent choice?

51:09.900 --> 51:12.392
- No, it's not a lucky guess.
- Really?

51:12.570 --> 51:16.029
Yeah, I spent two nights
in a soggy tent in Glastonbury

51:16.156 --> 51:18.739
just so I could shake my bum
to these gentlemen.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.526
It's having the same effect
on my ass too, right. Come here.

51:21.662 --> 51:24.370
OK, the chiffonade cut,
you need a knife with a long, thin blade

51:24.498 --> 51:27.036
and a handle
that you can hold like a sword.

51:27.543 --> 51:28.624
Right.

51:28.752 --> 51:32.211
You know, I read that list of things
that psychopaths are good at,

51:32.381 --> 51:35.545
and cooking
is right up there at the top.

51:35.676 --> 51:37.793
I'm almost afraid
to ask how good you are.

51:37.928 --> 51:40.261
Guy who taught me's
got two Michelin stars. Let's go.

51:40.389 --> 51:43.302
Oh, my God.
You're Hannibal bloody Lecter.

51:43.434 --> 51:44.925
Oh, hi.

51:45.686 --> 51:47.018
Um...

51:47.146 --> 51:49.684
I was just on my way up to bed.

51:50.649 --> 51:52.606
OK.

51:52.735 --> 51:55.102
Yeah. Um...

51:56.739 --> 52:00.073
If you see Sam, will you send him up?

52:00.200 --> 52:01.736
OK.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.705
- Good night.
- Good night.

52:15.841 --> 52:17.707
- Good night.
- Night.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.971
You know, I'm feeling
a little bushed myself.

52:27.102 --> 52:29.389
I think it's the jet lag.

52:29.521 --> 52:32.138
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

52:32.650 --> 52:34.357
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:35.861 --> 52:36.726
Sleep well.

52:39.865 --> 52:42.778
This is the best wine I've ever had.

52:44.953 --> 52:50.449
Normally it's an OK little winery,
but 2009 knocked it out of the park.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.880
And it goes deliciously
with these chocolates.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.215
Oh, thank you.

53:03.555 --> 53:05.012
Mmm.

53:08.268 --> 53:10.100
You're making me dizzy.

53:12.189 --> 53:15.648
Shh! Shh!

53:15.776 --> 53:17.768
- Be quiet.
- Shh!

53:17.903 --> 53:20.486
- My dad...
- You be quiet. "My dad."

53:20.614 --> 53:21.900
Harold!

53:55.482 --> 53:57.644
I wasn't a very good husband.

53:59.695 --> 54:02.654
Or father either, for that matter.

54:04.116 --> 54:06.199
Just couldn't say no

54:07.619 --> 54:09.986
to the work,

54:10.122 --> 54:12.580
to the women,

54:12.708 --> 54:14.791
to life's pleasures.

54:18.297 --> 54:23.088
And marriage puts a stop
to all that, doesn't it?

54:24.219 --> 54:25.881
It does tend to, yes.

54:28.724 --> 54:31.467
"The cradle rocks above an abyss,

54:31.602 --> 54:34.185
and common sense tells us

54:34.313 --> 54:38.102
that our existence
is but a brief crack of light

54:38.233 --> 54:41.101
between two eternities of darkness."

54:41.278 --> 54:43.361
Vladimir Nabokov.

54:48.619 --> 54:52.283
Our time in the light is nearly done.

54:54.625 --> 55:00.838
I sometimes wonder if we should
really be saying no to anything

55:00.964 --> 55:04.799
before we face the long night.

55:08.680 --> 55:12.424
So I'm making a collection
of face masks.

55:13.977 --> 55:15.593
What do you think?

55:15.729 --> 55:18.688
You've done this professionally, right?

55:18.816 --> 55:20.728
Well, I don't know.

55:20.901 --> 55:22.688
Like, I've never actually
been paid for it,

55:22.820 --> 55:27.030
so I don't think you could say
that I'm a professional.

55:27.533 --> 55:32.995
But, um, I've done it, like, 50 times
and I've only lost two people.

55:34.581 --> 55:35.617
- Lost?
- Yeah.

55:35.749 --> 55:37.832
Wait a minute.

55:38.418 --> 55:42.253
The breathing part is a bit tricky.

55:44.383 --> 55:45.419
OK.

55:46.635 --> 55:48.752
Stop. Stop.

55:48.887 --> 55:49.923
You're ticklish.

56:04.236 --> 56:06.319
Sorry, kid.

56:07.948 --> 56:10.031
What are you made of, rocks?

56:12.744 --> 56:15.282
Alright, I can do this.

56:20.961 --> 56:24.170
OK. OK. OK.

56:38.979 --> 56:41.062
Did you lose something?

56:44.192 --> 56:45.558
Yeah, yeah, actually.

56:45.694 --> 56:47.811
Um... Uh...

56:47.946 --> 56:51.064
The engagement ring
that you never gave back.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.406
Oh.

56:52.534 --> 56:54.571
- Well, it's not down there.
- Really?

56:54.703 --> 56:57.696
No. Wanna check the other side?

57:04.212 --> 57:05.453
OK, OK, wait, wait, wait.

57:05.589 --> 57:08.127
Mackenzie can
never, ever, ever know about this.

57:08.258 --> 57:12.002
- Oh, God. Or Sam.
- Of course, of course.

57:14.640 --> 57:15.926
And Eve.

57:16.058 --> 57:19.768
- Don't tell your mother, right?
- Oh, God, no. God, no. No, not...

57:21.396 --> 57:23.729
And you know, Laurence,
you know I love your father, I do.

57:23.857 --> 57:26.190
No. God, he's the most fucking
indiscreet person I know.

57:26.318 --> 57:27.980
- OK.
- Ooh!

57:28.111 --> 57:30.444
Oh, God. Oh, God.
OK, I'm here. Here we go.

57:30.572 --> 57:31.858
Just carry on.

57:56.515 --> 57:58.051
What?

57:58.183 --> 58:00.175
I don't know who's worse;

58:00.310 --> 58:02.677
you for putting this on,

58:04.022 --> 58:06.981
or you for watching this.

58:40.851 --> 58:43.389
It's hardly a comedy.

58:50.902 --> 58:54.270
- My love.
- Yes?

58:54.406 --> 58:57.444
- My love.
- Harold, are you drunk?

58:57.576 --> 59:01.160
I just had the most smashing
bottle of wine

59:01.288 --> 59:04.031
with your smashing ex-husband,

59:04.207 --> 59:07.075
who I think is smashing, by the way.

59:07.210 --> 59:09.623
Ah. Well, I'm glad that's going so well.

59:09.755 --> 59:13.999
It is, but what's not going well,
my dearest, is us.

59:14.134 --> 59:20.256
- Oh, yes?
- Yeah. I'm... I'm pining for you.

59:20.974 --> 59:26.811
How can you leave me
to languish on this moonlit night

59:26.938 --> 59:30.852
alone in my bed and you alone in yours?

59:30.984 --> 59:34.102
Alright, Mr. Shakespeare, off you go.

59:34.237 --> 59:36.775
It's bad luck to sleep together
the night before.

59:36.907 --> 59:40.901
- But I...
- I'll bend the rules so far.

59:45.665 --> 59:47.748
That's... That's your lot.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:02.927
I feel a lot of love about the things...

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.765
Love is in the air.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.031
The last one's up.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.205
Laurence, my sofa!

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.795
It's just a teensy, weensy
bit of spillage.

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.512
I'm gonna get another bottle.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:04.617
On the scale of bad ideas,
where do you think this... this one is?

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:09.284
Uh, I would say
it's, uh, somewhere between

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:14.122
when I kissed George Michael
thinking it was you...

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:19.458
...and you remember that time
I surprised you on tour?

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:22.176
- Oh, yeah, that was bad.
- That was terrible.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.843
- Listen, I...
- Yeah, I...

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:27.761
- Mom!
- Fuck.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.976
Hey, will you turn the light out?

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.139
Why?

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:35.982
- Mom!
- OK, I'm... I'm gonna borrow this. OK?

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:37.520
Huh?

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:43.777
- What are you doing?
- Just borrowing a book.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.816
- Why are you up?
- I had a nightmare.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.236
You were singing one of your new songs.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.871
Yeah, it's pretty sick
having your own blog.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:52.956
Like, you can just post
whatever you want.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:56.828
My mom or whoever can't come on
and be, like, "You can't post that."

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.718
Oh, my God.
I do not fuckin' believe that.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.587
- That is my phone.
- Who's "the boss"?

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.433
- That's my phone. Give that to me.
- It's the size of a fucking log.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.644
Saffie, that spanking
could do some serious damage.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.729
Get the fuck off of me!

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.770
And don't you dare call me Saffie,
you nosy bitch.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.152
What?

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:50.181
- You see it? That star over there?
- What is that? Is that the Bear?

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:52.470
I don't know. Is it? I'm asking you.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.745
Now who's the boss, Saffie? Slut!

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:42.937
God!

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:48.401
Yes!

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.359
Fuck. Fuck. Yes!

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:34.864
Fuck.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.661
Fuck.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:05:00.185
Fuck. Fuck!

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.430
Fuck!

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.299
Oh, my God.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:47.233
The sofa looks like
Gorbachev's forehead.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.622
Oh, God.

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:48.619
I'm not gonna marry Harold.

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:50.333
What? Why?

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:54.129
I've been up all night,
pacing around.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.298
What was I thinking,
getting married again?

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:00.468
I have my family,
the people that mean the most to me.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.637
And you know what I realized?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.433
There is only so much room
in the old attic.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.729
OK, sorry. You... You lost me.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:15.104
New people. All that baggage
has to go somewhere.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.072
To make room,
I'd have to start rearranging

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.283
everything that's already up here.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:24.447
New or different
doesn't necessarily mean better.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.544
What am I gonna do?

01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:38.257
Well, we've been here before,
having similar conversations,

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:42.132
normally after the marriage
has taken place.

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:47.012
So, in a way, I suppose we could say
we're making progress.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.473
Come in.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:08.707
It's disgusting. It's disgusting!
It's despicable!

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:11.118
- It's embarrassing!
- What? What?

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:14.543
How many other of my friends
have you shagged?

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.336
Tell me, Dad. How many are there?
Just tell me.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:21.962
- What do you take me for?
- What do you mean? A fucking pervert.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:28.636
- Where is that stupid fucking bitch?
- Rose. Rose. Darling!

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:29.974
Where are you?

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:33.314
You fucking slut!
I'm gonna knock your head off!

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.310
Fucking my dad?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:42.108
Wow. This got more hits
than the piano-playing kitty.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.198
<i>What do we have here?</i>

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.572
<i>Looks like Harold,</i>

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.450
<i>no, "the boss," and Saf f ie.</i>

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.459
If I ever see her again,
I'm gonna kill her.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:53.622
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.538
Although it is lucky that she happened
to be outside with her phone.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:09:00.212
Pink's a blogger, Dad.
Course she had her phone.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:04.089
<i>Oh, my God. I can't believe
I'm getting this on camera right now.</i>

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:08.259
<i>Oh, yeah."The boss" is Harold.</i>

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.814
Nice. That's awesome, Sam.

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.354
Good job, Sammy.

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:24.149
You knew, didn't you?

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:26.151
I wanted to come to see you,

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:30.997
but I was wondering if maybe by now,

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:35.836
you had developed
a spirit of wry realism

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:38.421
with regards to "happily ever after."

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.457
Wry realism?

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:46.260
Yes, well, maybe you were finally ready
to live with bumpily ever after.

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.341
Bumpily ever after?

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:53.312
- You think I'm making a mistake?
- With Harold? No.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.772
Harold's fine.
I personally have nothing against him.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.643
But you deserve way, way better.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:02.487
You deserve to be loved

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:05.070
because you've always been there
to give love.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.692
You deserve to be honored

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:13.082
because you carried this family
single-handedly on your shoulders.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:16.498
And now it's your turn to take a ride.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.250
My love, you spent the entire night
pacing back and forth in your jammies

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.172
and you still look so damn cute,

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.920
and that deserves to be cherished.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:33.306
And maybe it was no... accident

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:36.476
that Harold messed up last night.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:06.839
Oh, Dad.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.306
You've embarrassed us.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:18.515
What you did,
it was just creepy in so many ways.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:22.901
- You watched her grow up.
- I know.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.062
She was Rose's best friend,
for God's sake.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.566
I know. I never meant... It was...

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:32.028
I want... I just...

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:34.280
I packed up all my books.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.619
I really wanted this to work.

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:41.457
Such a... idiot.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.465
Yeah, you are.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:48.336
I thought it was romantic.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:54.349
I thought you'd finally found someone
to spend the rest of your life with.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.264
That you weren't gonna be alone.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:12:00.056
I wasn't gonna have to worry about you
living on cold pizza anymore.

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:02.604
Oh, darling,
that was not our relationship.

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.447
I thought you'd changed.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.284
I'm so, so sorry.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.580
- Come on...
- What am I gonna do?

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:32.342
Well, first of all, I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:37.680
And then we'll all go back to London

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:41.431
and to the shame of you
having been caught having sex

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:44.274
with a woman
nearly 40 years your junior.

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:48.650
And then you'll have to move to Italy

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:51.899
where they don't have a problem
with that sort of thing.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.357
I gather you've heard.

01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:20.488
- I've gone and ballsed this up.
- My cue to exit.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:22.159
No.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.411
You may as well stay.

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:31.586
Eve, I really wanted to be that man.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:34.460
The best man, you know, for you.

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:40.887
You were so utterly fucking fabulous

01:14:41.018 --> 01:14:44.227
and gorgeous and smart and charming,

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.764
and I thought I could change.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.017
But it's just not me.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:55.280
I'm so sorry that I have caused you
this humiliation.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:59.869
I just wish I could have it all
directed at me.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.874
Harold.

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:11.922
You might want to think
about growing up.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:17.962
Chasing 25-year-olds at your age,
it looks very sad.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:20.381
I look like a swine.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.683
Way more sad than that.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:27.312
I am so fucked.

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:32.059
Harold, before you start
flagellating yourself like a monk,

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.810
may I say something?

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:38.611
Eve is a fabulous woman,
she's a major catch,

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:43.909
and I'd say that sadly, from experience,
you're the one who lost out here.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:47.120
And if it makes you feel any better,

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:52.246
the reason I'm here in her bedroom
is because she wanted to tell me

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.374
that she wasn't going through
with the marriage,

01:15:55.509 --> 01:16:00.846
and this was before
you broke the internet

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:04.967
with your Legends of the AARP vine.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:29.829
Hey.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:32.494
I'm so sorry.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.916
You know what?

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:38.588
When it comes to apologizing
for parents who behave badly,

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.711
we are a family of world champs.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.433
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:52.223
I did not expect this weekend
to pan out like this.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.065
No.

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:56.276
How is everybody?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.904
Rose and Saffron aren't speaking.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:02.282
I don't think they ever will again.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:03.650
That bad, huh?

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:06.119
Well, not until they both coincidentally

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:09.452
have teenage children
in rehab in Minnesota.

01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:13.752
How about you?

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:20.043
I think I'm done trying to worry
everyone into making the right decision.

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:24.342
They always make the same stupid
decision they were going to anyway.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.762
I think it's my turn
to make a stupid decision, actually.

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:41.317
- I'm sorry. That was really stupid.
- No, no, no, no.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.943
I can be way more stupid than that.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.339
So how did you see this weekend
panning out?

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:09.133
Well, kind of like this.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.935
And what gave you that impression?

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.772
How we chop mint.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:19.526
We've got the same taste in music.

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.566
That is important.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.781
Yes, it is.

01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:31.577
And you got a whole lot of new material
for your next novel.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.790
Yeah, masses.

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:37.419
You know what I think?

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:42.211
I think you should stay in New York

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:45.802
and do a little research
on some of the American characters.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.556
Well, I can think of one.

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:51.845
OK.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:56.187
But I'm a little worried
that he wants to eat me

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:59.353
with some fava beans and nice chianti.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:03.979
<i>Look, I think
I ought to tell you something.</i>

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:14.323
You don't have to say goodbye.
Just jump in the car.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:15.699
It's great to see you.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:17.917
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:20.537
Bye. Bye.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:40.770
I have a lot of answering to do,
to all of you, and I will.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:44.770
But for now I want you to know

01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:47.773
that I'm so sorry
for having let you all down.

01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:50.491
But I promise you,

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:54.078
we will get over this
and we will move forward, together.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.368
Yeah, right, Dad.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.243
- I'm stopping off in New York.
- What?

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:02.371
Probably gonna stay for a few months.

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:05.169
- You two are on your own.
- No, Clemmie.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.884
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:17.219
Mom, if you sleep with your friend,
does it ruin the friendship?

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:21.268
- Oh. Well, it never did for me.
- Really?

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.608
Yeah, but I can count my real friends
on one hand.

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:26.228
I mean, actually,
I don't even need one hand.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:34.617
You know, the important part is not
working on staying friends afterwards.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:36.830
That's what ruins it.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:42.043
But you don't have to worry about that.
You're gonna have kids with 15 fingers.

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:45.130
- Way bigger things to worry about.
- Oh, my God.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:46.964
- Giant gloves.
- That's not...

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:49.880
- Maybe mittens. That's better, right?
- That's not even funny.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.342
Alright.

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:55.511
- I'm a good mommy.
- Yeah.

01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:57.508
- I gotta go.
- Why?

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.603
I gotta go call Sam's dad.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.022
OK.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.820
Oh, God.
I'm gonna have to say something.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.626
I'll do it.

01:21:58.288 --> 01:22:01.656
Hello, everyone.
I have an announcement to make.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:09.457
After much deliberation and mature
reflection by the parties in question,

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.299
it has been mutually decided

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:17.890
that the advertised wedding
will not be going forward.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:24.559
Now, I know that's a disappointment
to everyone, but look at it this way.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:30.061
At least we won't
have to have pasta after the ballet.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.781
Too soon. Very well.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.491
Uh, boys.

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:44.078
Boys, if you would,
a clever and imaginative toast, please?

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:45.950
To calling it off?

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:51.252
Well done.
To Eve and Harold for calling it off.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:53.875
- Cheers.
- To Eve and Harold for calling it off.

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:58.346
However, Judge McCaffery is here.
Everything is set up.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.637
Why not take advantage?

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:04.886
So would anyone
like to get married today?

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:06.888
Anybody at all? It's all on us.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:11.940
Actually, it's on Eve,
because I'm incredibly cheap.

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:13.106
Anybody?

01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:18.900
No, OK. Well, I have a suggestion.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:21.486
Eve?

01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:25.457
Eve, show yourself.

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:43.847
My dear, before another marriage
ends in divorce or death,

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:48.267
why don't we just cut to the chase
and tie the knot?

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:50.602
What?

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:54.353
I mean, if there is somebody else
you'd like to marry first,

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:57.731
before you remarry me, that's fine.

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:01.614
- Boys, what do you think?
- You're on your own here, Dad.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:06.115
- I definitely wanna hear this.
- Mom, it's Dad, so a prenup is a must.

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.993
Thanks, kids. You're out of the will.

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:18.843
Eve, I've done some stupid things
in my life.

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:23.348
But that was actually
the younger, dumber me.

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:28.019
I remember him well.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:32.064
I constantly hear people say

01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:35.606
they're looking for the person
they wanna grow old with.

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:41.950
But we're here, now,
living it right now.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.865
I wanna grow old with you.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:47.614
I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:51.667
Will you be my wife?

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.878
Will you marry me?

01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:57.752
Again?

01:25:13.817 --> 01:25:15.558
Yes.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:30.952
Come on down here.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.122
I do.

01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:40.800
Then I pronounce you man and wife.

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:08.911
All in all, I would have to say

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:13.534
it was one of Eve's
more entertaining family get-togethers.

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:16.537
Laughter, tears, love and sex.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.040
Who could quibble?

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:24.010
Do you know where your grandmother is?
Sorry. One second. I'll be right back.

01:26:24.137 --> 01:26:26.220
I just wanted to show her something.

01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:30.967
And could you cut the "grandmother" bit?
Otherwise it's...

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:39.020
Actors.

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:09.694
<i>Look at them,</i>

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:13.786
<i>standing around the piano like
they're singing "The Circle of Life"</i>

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:17.498
<i>when they're actually
singing a song about cheating.</i>

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.208
<i>See? I told you.</i>

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:24.998
<i>When it comes to my family,
love is just one big mystery.</i>

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.700
Wait for it.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.537
Wait.

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:41.783
Going.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:44.869
Going.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.374
Gone.

01:29:58.101 --> 01:30:00.184
Almost dark.

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:13.147
There.

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.916
