Black Lightning...

00:01.750 --> 00:04.838
                 The Markovians
are on the outskirts
of Freeland

00:04.878 --> 00:07.173
      and they're marshalling
their forces.

        [speaking Russian]

00:09.759 --> 00:11.010
                 The Markovians
want to capture

00:11.051 --> 00:13.887
       or kill as many metas
as possible.

00:13.929 --> 00:15.682
        Markovians breached
the compound.

-Copy.

00:18.559 --> 00:21.353
        Me, Reverend Holt,
and a handful of other people,

00:21.396 --> 00:23.356
       we started up our own
underground railroad.

00:23.397 --> 00:25.649
     We've been sneaking metas
and suspected metas

         [Black Lightning]
What happened?

00:29.528 --> 00:30.655
         We got ambushed.

00:30.696 --> 00:32.448
         They hit us with
some kind of poison.

00:33.741 --> 00:34.616
           It can't be.

faster than anything
I have ever seen.

in my apartment?

00:48.338 --> 00:50.716
       Don't dash it, perv.
Why do you have
photos of my mom?

00:50.759 --> 00:51.968

       [helicopter whirring]

01:13.406 --> 01:15.784
          Why is my life
always so messed up?

           The medicine
isn't working anymore.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.831
       So I'm shapeshifting
left and right.

01:23.165 --> 01:25.376
         I thought getting
my feelings out in this video

01:25.418 --> 01:27.378
 would help me stabilize, but...

01:29.171 --> 01:30.799
          I'm so scared.

01:44.436 --> 01:47.397
     I keep shifting all day.

01:47.439 --> 01:49.275
        I can't control it,
I don't know
what's happening.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.110
         Okay, [shushing]

01:51.152 --> 01:53.445
       I've got you, Grace.

01:53.487 --> 01:56.281
     Now your emotional state,
it causes you to shift,

01:56.323 --> 01:59.034
    so you've gotta calm down.

01:59.076 --> 02:00.537
            You wanna do
our routine together?

02:01.162 --> 02:01.662
               Okay?

02:01.662 --> 02:03.790
             -Shonda.
Yes, Anissa.

     Breathe in and out, okay?

02:15.300 --> 02:16.885
         You're safe here.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.848
          Just listen to

gonna be around

    to talk me down like that.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.979
       Where am I gonna be?

03:09.813 --> 03:12.692
             Oh, snap.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.360
          So you plannin'
on breaking up with me?

03:15.402 --> 03:17.780
            You so cold,
but you so fine, come here.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.490
    Look, I'm serious, Anissa.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.409
         I heard the ASA's
going door to door now.

03:22.451 --> 03:24.412
       -If they come here...
-They won't come here.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.998
      And that creepy Odell,
I mean, he already paid us
a social call.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.959
       He could pop back in
any minute

03:30.001 --> 03:31.419
      and if I can't control
my shifts--

03:31.461 --> 03:33.253
       -Grace, Grace, Grace.
-No.

03:33.295 --> 03:36.591

the ASA take you.

come back yet?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.187
             Not yet.

03:50.229 --> 03:52.731
        But we'll keep you
out of sight

03:52.774 --> 03:54.609
   until I figure something out.

03:56.026 --> 03:57.319
            All right?

04:09.039 --> 04:10.165

              [beeps]

04:44.617 --> 04:47.452
        I don't appreciate
being summoned, Gambi.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.204
           You obviously
have no more respect

04:49.247 --> 04:50.831
            for my work
than Jefferson does.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.545
      Did something happened
with the girls?

04:57.254 --> 04:59.632
         No, they're fine.

04:59.673 --> 05:00.466
       So what's so urgent?

05:00.466 --> 05:03.802
        Ever since the ASA
had that fire fight
with the Markovians,

05:03.845 --> 05:06.221
       the ASA has gone into
overdrive with Jeff

05:06.264 --> 05:07.973
         and Anissa smack
in the line of fire.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.769
     Now I can't protect them
unless I stay ahead of
the ASA's plans.

05:11.810 --> 05:14.646
        So I need to access
the ASA's mainframe.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.024
        Well, the only way
to do that would be...

05:20.694 --> 05:21.987
              Gambi.

05:22.029 --> 05:24.156

in a sedan,

05:24.197 --> 05:26.492
          I'm blindfolded
for the entire journey

05:26.533 --> 05:29.077
        to and from the Pit,
I have no idea where it is.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.497
       I do, that's not what
I need you for.

05:31.538 --> 05:32.581
           I need you...

              [beeps]

05:38.211 --> 05:39.629

              [sighs]

05:47.555 --> 05:50.266
       This Markovian attack
has got the ASA so riled up,

05:50.307 --> 05:52.810
    they're going door to door
in Freeland looking for
safe houses.

05:52.851 --> 05:54.519
       Which will eventually
lead them here.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.189

from stepping one foot inside

they reach here?

             Not long.

in the works to breach
the reinforced perimeter,

usually die young."

I'm the best

we can't risk you
falling into enemy hands.

using your powers.

        The Markovian threat
is far greater than
we thought, Jennifer.

     Our underground railroad?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.139
               Plan?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.182
        So you're involved
with planting that bomb?

10:42.224 --> 10:44.934
   I'm more than involved, Jeff,
and I want to bring you
in to the fold

10:44.976 --> 10:46.645
         but I don't know
exactly where you stand.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.065
         Now, one minute,
Black Lightning
is roughing up the ASA

10:49.105 --> 10:50.857
     over some damn graffiti,
and the next minute,

10:50.899 --> 10:53.068
        he's saving the ASA
from a bomb.

10:53.110 --> 10:53.943
    Whose side are you on, man?

10:53.943 --> 10:57.114
     Wait, you planted a bomb,
man, you could've hurt
innocent people.

10:57.155 --> 11:00.158
    I controlled the detonator
and made sure no one
was in the vicinity.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.620
      No, no, you know bombs
misfire all the time.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.163
     The shrapnel could've hit
the guard or you.

11:05.206 --> 11:05.914
      Or one of the children.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.500
  It was a calculated risk, Jeff,
what am I supposed to do.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.001
        Let the ASA capture
more metas?

11:10.043 --> 11:12.504
        No, of course not,
I'm talking innocent people,

11:12.546 --> 11:14.090
          you're talking
a calculated risk?

11:14.130 --> 11:15.548
     Are you hearing yourself
right now?

11:15.591 --> 11:18.177
         Hate begets hate,
violence begets violence.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.178
        And toughness begets
a greater toughness, yeah, man,

11:20.221 --> 11:21.346
              I know,
you ain't the only one

11:21.389 --> 11:23.557
      who can quote Dr. King
from memory.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.809
  Now, look, the ASA, ever since
they came to Freeland,

11:25.850 --> 11:28.687
    they have forced me to push
their agenda through
press conferences,

11:28.729 --> 11:31.106
       they have taken over
my police station.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.817
           They got one
of my officers killed.

11:32.857 --> 11:34.527
    Yeah, the ASA locked me up.

11:34.567 --> 11:37.278
     Poked me like a lab rat,
took me away from my family.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.447
    Beat me down in the street.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.033
          So I understand
you frustrated,

11:41.075 --> 11:44.120
        you're pissed off,
so am I.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.746
       But I cannot get down
with your methods, man.

11:46.788 --> 11:48.749
    Duly noted for the record.

11:48.790 --> 11:52.211
       I'm only trying to do
what I can to protect
this city.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.381
  Yeah. By living a double life.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.259
     Member of the resistance.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.845
          Now you remember
how pissed off you were

12:00.885 --> 12:02.303
      when I didn't tell you
I was Black Lightning.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.179
      Who got the secret now?

12:03.221 --> 12:06.475
     Are you seriously trying
to compare me keeping
a secret for 30 days

12:06.517 --> 12:08.226
      to you keeping a secret
for 30 years?

12:08.269 --> 12:11.397
      No, look, the point is,
we gotta get on the same page.

12:11.438 --> 12:14.567
         And by same page,
you mean doing things the way
you would do them.

12:14.607 --> 12:18.028
          Now, look, this
"my way or the highway" mess
you run on your daughters,

12:18.070 --> 12:19.697
       you can't run on me,
I know what I'm doing.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.698
      All I'm saying is that

12:21.740 --> 12:23.743
       we gotta communicate
our plans with each other.

12:23.783 --> 12:26.077
         Oh, okay, great,
so then next time,

12:26.120 --> 12:27.663
          Black Lightning
goes out on the street,

12:27.705 --> 12:29.164
   he'll give me a call, right?

12:30.791 --> 12:31.667
               Huh?

12:33.711 --> 12:34.919
         Didn't think so.

12:34.961 --> 12:36.588
       Since we can't get on
the same page,

12:36.629 --> 12:39.633
       how about you handle
the ASA your way,
I'll handle it my way.

12:39.674 --> 12:42.344
         No, Henny, Bill!

12:42.385 --> 12:43.721
           [door closes]

12:53.980 --> 12:55.899

in the nick of time

12:55.941 --> 12:57.109
      to short out the bomb.

12:57.150 --> 12:58.652
               -Who?
-Black Lightning.

12:58.693 --> 13:01.071
       Coincidence? Hell no.
I don't think so.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.908
       He's a ASA sell-out.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.077
        They are closing in
on us, Blackbird.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.663
      I still don't have a way
through the upgraded perimeter.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.625
     Well, I pray you get it,
post haste.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.251
    The children will stay here
with me hidden until you do.

13:19.506 --> 13:22.634
      Gambi, what's the status
on the updated perimeter?

13:22.676 --> 13:23.885

13:51.371 --> 13:54.415
        what an honor it is
for me to be working
alongside you.

-I followed your career
for several years.

-Sleep inducing?

14:02.173 --> 14:04.134
            -[chuckles]
-Brilliant.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.345
         Ground breaking.

14:06.386 --> 14:08.889
        You don't strike me
as the type of woman
who's interested in accolades

14:08.931 --> 14:11.767
     but in my humble opinion,

14:11.808 --> 14:12.976
          you deserve it.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.144
           All of them.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.692
      Uh, well, I'm grateful
to have someone
with your credentials

14:19.732 --> 14:21.025

14:22.820 --> 14:24.153
        on your first day.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.700
      Can't really help that,
Dr. Stewart.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.158
            I was born
with a brown nose.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.577

14:33.621 --> 14:35.206

14:37.750 --> 14:39.043

14:39.086 --> 14:40.796
          Is that one of
the Green Light metas?

14:42.088 --> 14:44.216
  [Lynn sighs] Yes. Erica Moran.

     Are you all right, Erica?

14:53.017 --> 14:55.727
      [Dr. Blair] Her output
has dropped to 50%.

               -40%.
-Why? What happened?

14:57.605 --> 14:59.273

like a muscle,

        -if you don't train
that muscle--
-It becomes weak.

15:01.274 --> 15:02.400
             Exactly.

15:02.442 --> 15:03.903
    Metas can't maintain output

15:03.943 --> 15:05.738

without exhaustion.

15:05.778 --> 15:07.655

          Hold on, Major.

15:12.702 --> 15:14.663
       If you want the metas
to be stable for longer,

15:14.705 --> 15:18.250
     Dr. Blair and I will need
clearance to all the sectors
in this facility

15:18.292 --> 15:20.878

         On one condition,

15:38.604 --> 15:39.647
            you'll have
additional access,

I'm saying this,

miss Odell.

19:18.531 --> 19:20.075
           Come on now.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.077
             Come on.

19:30.376 --> 19:31.836
           -[all scream]
-Lord!

19:31.878 --> 19:33.838
    Lord have mercy, Two-Bits.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.883
      About to send your ass
to the promised land.

19:39.886 --> 19:41.971
      Hey, man, I was just...

19:42.013 --> 19:43.347
        seeing how you all
was holding up.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.392
              -Oh...
-I figured y'all
would be hungry,

19:45.433 --> 19:48.895
         so bought you all
some chicken wings, you know,
some fries, you know?

19:48.936 --> 19:50.855
             -Snacks.
-It's all right.

19:50.897 --> 19:53.901
         -Come on, y'all.
-Hey, I got a little something
strong for you, Rev.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.193
     -That's just what I need.
-[chuckles]

19:55.234 --> 19:56.028
      Come on, get something
to eat then.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.865
      Get some plates and get
some chicken
and some French fries.

19:59.906 --> 20:01.950
     -So you got my favorite?
-[chuckles] Yes, sir.

20:03.743 --> 20:05.203
       Ah, praise the Lord.

20:05.244 --> 20:06.954
     Praise the Lord. [laughs]

20:13.628 --> 20:15.923
    Okay, so before I come in,
have you...

20:15.963 --> 20:18.299
          invited me here
just so you could
throw me out?

20:18.342 --> 20:19.384
            Yet again?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.553
           Dad, come in.

20:30.436 --> 20:32.564
         I need your help,
I want you to take my place

20:32.605 --> 20:34.566
      escorting the children
out of the perimeter.

20:34.607 --> 20:36.567
      You want me to help you
with the underground railroad?

20:36.609 --> 20:38.444
               -Yes.
-Okay, first I have to ask...

20:38.487 --> 20:41.573
       did you know anything
about Henderson
planting a bomb?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.909
          Look, I knew he
and Reverend Holt
were planning something.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.327
        -Reverend Holt too?
-But I did not know
the specifics.

20:46.827 --> 20:47.996
             [scoffs]

20:49.957 --> 20:51.333
     So now that you're aware,

20:52.084 --> 20:52.750
     what are your intentions?

20:52.792 --> 20:55.336
       You're gonna continue
to be a symbol for a movement

20:55.378 --> 20:57.547
          that uses those
kind of tactics?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.509
          Come on, Anissa,
I taught you
better than that.

21:01.550 --> 21:03.428
       The ends don't always
justify the means.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.265
   Well, if we lived in a world
that was black and white, yes.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.141
         But we are living
in an occupation,

21:08.182 --> 21:11.811
     and if I'm being honest,
I had to do some things
that I'm not proud of

21:11.853 --> 21:13.896
      to make the underground
railroad work.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.108
             -Such as?
-Please, please,
do not do this right now.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.112
        Besides this is not
about me or the resistance.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.739
       It's about the people
who need Black Lightning.

21:27.702 --> 21:30.204
      I need Black Lightning.

21:31.205 --> 21:33.375
         There. I said it.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.376
          Are you happy?

21:38.672 --> 21:41.008
        Grace can't control
her shapeshifting.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.386
       And I'm worried that
she'll be captured by the ASA.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.346
           -Oh, Anissa.
-Dad.

21:48.097 --> 21:49.266
            I love her.

21:49.307 --> 21:51.643
            And I would
get her out myself.

21:51.684 --> 21:54.145
        But I am still hurt
from bringing Tavon back,

21:54.186 --> 21:56.522
          like you asked.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.734
   And I know I'm always saying
that I'm a grown-ass woman

21:59.776 --> 22:01.193
      and that I've got this.

22:03.529 --> 22:05.365
        And most days I do.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.452
           But today...

22:12.372 --> 22:13.457
          Today I don't.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.923
        And I am asking you

22:23.383 --> 22:24.759
             to help.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.096
              [sighs]

22:34.728 --> 22:37.271
           The mainframe
is around the corner,
second door on the left.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.776
          [all clamoring]

22:40.817 --> 22:43.528
       Let her go. Hey, hey.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.030
         Hey! Get off her.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.615
          [all clamoring]

22:49.576 --> 22:51.494
   The Marko what? I don't know
nothing about that.

22:52.078 --> 22:53.288
             [grunts]

22:56.583 --> 22:57.959
            [grunting]

22:59.836 --> 23:01.462
        Stay down, old man.

23:03.089 --> 23:05.008
       Hey. Leave him alone.

23:05.049 --> 23:06.300
   Next house, Sergeant Grayle.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.474
       [indistinct shouting]

23:21.482 --> 23:23.192
       Team bravo, advance.

23:29.615 --> 23:31.034
     [Major Grey] Take cover.

23:32.451 --> 23:33.744
      Team bravo, fall back.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.997
         Fire Team Alpha,
lay down suppressive fire.

23:44.839 --> 23:46.465
          [all groaning]

23:57.810 --> 24:01.897
         [people groaning]

24:32.136 --> 24:35.056
   Well, we were very fortunate
to have you in the area.

24:35.097 --> 24:37.851
        You turned my city
into a war zone.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.435
            -[gunshots]
-[man groans]

24:44.231 --> 24:47.027
             -[grunts]
-We don't execute people
in Freeland.

24:47.067 --> 24:50.447
     -[Major Grey] Let him go.
-You had no right to commit
cold-blooded murder.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.240
       I said put him down.

24:52.281 --> 24:54.284
        I don't take orders
from you, lady.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.368
  Black Lightning, you will obey
my commands,

24:56.411 --> 24:58.747
      or I will order enough
air strikes to turn
this craphole

24:58.788 --> 25:02.459
        into hell on Earth,
and I will simply pick
the enemy from the rubble.

25:06.712 --> 25:07.923
             [grunts]

25:09.715 --> 25:10.592
            Commandos.

25:11.384 --> 25:12.676
         Police the area.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.762
         Collect our dead.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.307
            [grumbles]

25:25.356 --> 25:26.607
       [indistinct talking]

25:38.912 --> 25:40.372
          And you've never
been here before?

25:40.413 --> 25:43.124
           No, Grey only
recently gave me access--

25:43.708 --> 25:45.585
          [gasps] Khalil?

25:46.961 --> 25:48.128
              [beeps]

25:48.712 --> 25:49.756
              Khalil.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.590
             [gasping]

25:53.093 --> 25:54.927
        He can't hear you.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.513
       How is that possible?
We buried him.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.890
          It's in stasis.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.393
       The most humane thing
we can do is unplug it.

26:01.433 --> 26:02.434
                No!

26:03.686 --> 26:05.313
          Khalil is still
in there somewhere.

26:09.942 --> 26:11.569
         Lynn, stop this.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.279
     The Khalil we knew died.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.906
       The ASA is gonna know
that you tampered
with this thing.

26:15.949 --> 26:18.910
   It looks like they completely
wiped his limbic system.

26:18.951 --> 26:20.578
     He's got an advanced chip
in his brain.

26:20.619 --> 26:23.248
       I've seen experiments
with prosthetics in the blind,

26:23.289 --> 26:26.459
         but this... Wait.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.128
     I found his memory files,
I'm gonna open one.

26:41.641 --> 26:44.269
              [Lynn]
His memories are intact.

26:44.310 --> 26:46.395
        The Khalil we know
is still in there.

26:48.522 --> 26:49.857
        [Khalil screaming]

26:57.531 --> 26:58.782
      I'm gonna wake him up.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.161
    Lynn, let this go, please.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.637
       Your staring is less
than professional, Doctor.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.390
      Stewart, Lynn Stewart.
I'm sorry, I just...

27:24.351 --> 27:26.978
       -Do you recognize me?
-Oh, of course.

27:27.019 --> 27:28.563
      Your CV is in my files.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.066
         Dr. Lynn Stewart,

27:31.106 --> 27:33.734
     prize-winning, respected
neuro surgeon and scientist.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.862
      Specialty, meta-humans.

27:37.905 --> 27:39.574
       What do you require,
Dr. Stewart?

27:43.994 --> 27:45.538
   State your previous missions.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.547
      Eliminate the smuggler
known as Sinzell. Check.

27:54.588 --> 27:57.342
   Destroy Markovian safe house.
Levelled.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.719
            Exterminate
the Blackbird. Done.

28:01.512 --> 28:02.721
       Kill Nichelle Payne.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.476
    Terminated with prejudice.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.935
            Oh, my God.

28:11.897 --> 28:13.357
        Is there a problem,
Dr. Stewart?

28:15.442 --> 28:17.862
        No, I just need you
to return to stasis,

28:17.903 --> 28:20.906
    so I can run a few upgrades
on your brain chip.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.673
         That thing killed
Khalil's mother.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.425
         You need to shut
this monster down, Lynn,

28:39.467 --> 28:41.594
       before the ASA uses it
to slaughter anyone else.

28:41.635 --> 28:43.262
        He's not a monster.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.932
     Don't call him a monster
or an "it" or a thing

28:45.973 --> 28:47.892
         or any other word
that isn't Khalil.

28:47.933 --> 28:53.397
       I lost 14 kids, Gambi,
14 people died because of me.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.942
         And I won't lose
another person ever again.

28:56.984 --> 28:59.695
         I'll save Khalil
if it's the last thing I do.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.615
         Lynn. I beg of you
to set your emotions aside.

29:02.656 --> 29:04.241
           You should go
before you're discovered.

29:05.117 --> 29:06.786
     Or I turn you in myself.

29:11.165 --> 29:12.166
              [sighs]

29:13.960 --> 29:17.505
           I've given you
administrative rights
to the ASA network.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.592
      You'll have full access
to the ASA's database,

29:20.633 --> 29:23.761
              and all
the surveillance footage
from inside the Pit.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.680
        I hope in the end,
you'll do the right thing.

29:27.682 --> 29:28.849
         When have I not?

29:31.478 --> 29:32.394
              Now go.

29:36.273 --> 29:37.317
             Peter...

29:39.234 --> 29:40.819
  Jen can never know about this.

30:00.339 --> 30:02.342
             Man, Jen,
quit playing around.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.759
           Tell me what
you know about Jace.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.222
             All right,
but first things first.

30:08.722 --> 30:09.973
          Touch my hand.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.601
          [clicks tongue]
No, that's stupid.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.644
    I need to know what happens
when our powers merge, okay?

30:13.685 --> 30:15.020
    Why are you still on this?

30:15.063 --> 30:16.480
         Do you wanna find
Dr. Jace or not?

30:25.698 --> 30:27.075
      [electricity crackling]

30:31.913 --> 30:33.288
            [exclaims]

30:33.330 --> 30:35.750
      Brandon, do your powers
do this with anybody else?

30:36.375 --> 30:37.585
                No.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.380
            All right.

30:40.421 --> 30:41.881
      That's it, that's done.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.090
            Now tell me
what you know about Jace.

30:47.052 --> 30:49.180
    Okay, do it one more time.

30:49.221 --> 30:51.598
       -Stop messing around.
-Just do it one more time

30:51.641 --> 30:52.933
        and I'ma tell you.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.188
          You know what?

30:57.230 --> 30:59.398
        You don't even know
nothing about Dr. Jace.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.442
             Get out.

31:02.484 --> 31:04.863
         Brandon, you need
to chill out, it ain't ever
that serious.

31:04.903 --> 31:08.365
        Jace killed my mom,
so, yes, that's serious, Jen.

31:08.407 --> 31:10.201
        And I ain't got time
for your games right now.

31:10.242 --> 31:11.451
         So here, get out.

31:12.202 --> 31:13.788
       Fine. [clears throat]

31:13.829 --> 31:16.164
       -It's like that, huh?
-Yeah, it's like that.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.542
       -Don't slam my door.
-[door slams shut]

31:21.128 --> 31:22.462
             [coughs]

31:22.505 --> 31:24.673
      [Anissa] This is as far
as I can take you, okay?

31:24.715 --> 31:26.718
       Someone else is gonna
guide you the rest of the way.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.928
   No, no, no, I don't wanna go
with anyone else.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.221
      Don't leave me, Anissa.

31:30.262 --> 31:30.846
           Look, I know,

31:30.846 --> 31:33.057
       you've been abandoned
in the past, Grace,

31:33.098 --> 31:35.393
         and I would never
ever do that to you.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.563
    I don't have my powers yet.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.356
         So I have someone
who is super strong
to protect you.

31:41.982 --> 31:42.983
               Who?

31:47.113 --> 31:49.073
         I don't know him.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.407
    Don't make me go with him.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.784
           He'll hurt me
like the other men.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.327
          Hey, hey, hey.

31:53.368 --> 31:56.623
          Black Lightning
would never hurt you, Grace.

31:56.663 --> 32:00.250
            I trust him
more than anybody
in the world.

32:00.292 --> 32:02.670
           -So can you.
-Grace.

32:02.711 --> 32:03.880
        I will protect you.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.382
          Let me take you
somewhere safe.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.261
      Look. This necklace...

32:11.304 --> 32:13.765
     it's very special to me.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.223
    And I want you to have it.

32:16.308 --> 32:18.144
      Now if you get scared,

32:18.185 --> 32:19.519
        you just touch it.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.355
     And I'm always with you.

32:23.482 --> 32:25.484
     Okay, you gotta go, okay?

32:25.526 --> 32:27.069
    We won't be apart for long.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.445
             Promise?

32:28.488 --> 32:30.239
         Yeah, I promise.

32:31.990 --> 32:32.991
             Go ahead.

32:34.743 --> 32:35.744
       [cell phone beeping]

32:38.288 --> 32:38.830
  Gambi just sent the coordinates

32:38.830 --> 32:40.625
      of where you can breach
the perimeter.

32:40.666 --> 32:42.335
           I'll send them
to you and the Perdi.

32:42.376 --> 32:43.961
    All right, tell the others
I'm on my way.

32:44.002 --> 32:45.003
         Let's go, Grace.

32:45.046 --> 32:45.922
        Black Lightning...

32:47.339 --> 32:48.383
            thank you.

32:51.009 --> 32:52.220
         Let's go, Grace.

          [Reverend Holt]
Yeah, Blackbird told me
you'd be coming.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.648
    See, I'm still not convinced
I should turn these kids over

33:04.691 --> 33:05.983
         to the ASA's boy.

33:06.025 --> 33:06.692
   We don't have time for this.

33:06.692 --> 33:10.488
     And Judas betrayed Jesus
for a mere 30 silver pieces.

33:10.529 --> 33:13.156
       What's the ASA's price
for your soul, Black Lightning?

33:13.199 --> 33:14.866
     I don't work for the ASA.

33:14.909 --> 33:17.662
     Yeah? Then I'm the first
black Pope.

33:17.703 --> 33:20.789
      The ASA is a block away,
they'll be here any minute.

33:23.875 --> 33:26.586
           Lord help you
if you're lying to me,
Black Lightning.

33:26.628 --> 33:28.839
    Now I'll put down my arms.

33:28.881 --> 33:32.634
    For I know the God I serve
moves in mysterious ways.

33:32.676 --> 33:34.302
        Now He may not come
when you want Him to--

33:34.345 --> 33:35.846
  But He's always right on time,
yeah.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.808

in the necklace
that I gave Grace.

      to have such an amazing
family, Mr. Pierce.

      I wish that I had a dad
who cared for me

37:47.974 --> 37:49.432

for Anissa.

Jefferson Pierce's.

I'll never tell anyone.
