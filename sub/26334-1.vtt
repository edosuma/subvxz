♪

00:05.788 --> 00:08.486
DANNY: You know, I want to be
one of those people that spends

00:08.530 --> 00:11.054
their sunny days laying
out at the beach.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.316
We're at the shore,
aren't we?

00:12.360 --> 00:14.231
Yeah, but we're
in the wrong kind of suits.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.232
What do you got?

00:15.276 --> 00:16.407
A floater.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.322
A floater. Great.

00:18.366 --> 00:21.325
What's your least favorite thing
on the job besides floaters?

00:21.369 --> 00:22.674
Well, that's number two.

00:22.718 --> 00:23.936
I think ripe ones
are worse.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.287
Yeah. I guess
pedophiles, for me.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.679
Mine's headless floaters.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.855
Headless floaters?Yeah.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.944
You find the body?Yeah,

00:31.988 --> 00:33.424
I was on a foot post
and he was right over there,

00:33.468 --> 00:34.425
near the rocks.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.297
The head wash up?Not yet.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.299
Any visible wounds
or bullet holes?

00:38.342 --> 00:39.517
Not that I could see.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.608
It's gonna be a bitch
to determine cause of death

00:43.652 --> 00:44.827
without the head.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.270
I think the tattoo
says it all.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.447
The Black Hand.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.536
Mexican Mafia.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.365
Yeah. Mexican Mafia.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.110
600 square feet.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.895
You've got east view, hmm?

01:09.939 --> 01:12.289
And you're right next
to the elevator.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.595
Nice, huh?

01:13.638 --> 01:15.814
Yeah. Absolutely.
But why are you...

01:15.858 --> 01:19.209
This is your new office, Erin.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.168
I'm promoting you
to bureau chief.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.474
Congratulations.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.129
:
W...

01:26.173 --> 01:27.522
I guess I have to ask.

01:27.565 --> 01:29.872
Is this because of Monica?

01:29.915 --> 01:31.395
Why does that matter?Well, she was

01:31.439 --> 01:33.093
my friend and she was murdered

01:33.136 --> 01:35.443
and it just feels weird
to just...Keep going?

01:35.486 --> 01:37.445
That's life, Erin.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.971
There's no room for
sentimentality in this office.

01:42.014 --> 01:44.016
Meaning?Everyone knows

01:44.060 --> 01:45.931
you got two brothers on
the job, your father's PC,

01:45.975 --> 01:48.020
you're sympathetic
to law enforcement.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.893
I have always followed
the letter of the law.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.547
I have no doubt.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.462
But I just want you to know

01:54.505 --> 01:56.681
that people will be watching you
more closely

01:56.725 --> 01:58.335
than they ever have before.

01:58.379 --> 01:59.206
People?

01:59.249 --> 02:00.511
Me.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.558
Let me know if
you need anything.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.563
Actually...

02:10.521 --> 02:12.480
...I'd like to stay
in my office,

02:12.523 --> 02:15.918
and I'd like to keep Anthony
Abetemarco as my investigator.

02:15.961 --> 02:18.660
There's that sentimentality
creeping in.It's just

02:18.703 --> 02:20.401
the geography I'm used to.

02:20.444 --> 02:21.880
Have it your way.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.578
And...

02:23.621 --> 02:25.145
thank you.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.798
Very much.

02:26.842 --> 02:29.410
Of course.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.418
And the final item is the fallen
heroes dinner with the mayor.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.160
It's now moved
to the 15th.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.121
Anybody home?

03:03.226 --> 03:05.402
My son Jamie

03:05.446 --> 03:09.493
and his partner Eddie
got engaged this weekend.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.886
Whoa! Good for them!Congratulations!

03:10.929 --> 03:12.061
Great!

03:12.104 --> 03:13.236
That's great!Thank you.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.239
Thank you very much.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.241
And it is their plan

03:18.285 --> 03:22.027
to still keep riding together
as partners.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.814
Oh.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.033
Boy, that's a problem.

03:28.077 --> 03:30.340
It is?

03:30.384 --> 03:32.560
Why?

03:32.603 --> 03:35.563
Why? A million good reasons.

03:35.606 --> 03:38.479
First of all,
it's against regulations.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.655
Well, technically, it's not.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.266
There's nothing in the book
forbidding it.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.659
Really?

03:44.702 --> 03:47.749
Really.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.578
Well, there ought to be.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.406
If you feel that strongly,

03:52.449 --> 03:55.017
why not just issue
an interim order against it?

04:00.327 --> 04:03.112
Draw one up, Sid.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.467
MAN: Hey!
Uh, please...What's going on with this guy?

04:10.511 --> 04:12.469
Someone! Hey, we
got a problem here!

04:12.513 --> 04:13.601
Maybe he just had dinner
with his fiancée's family.

04:13.644 --> 04:14.906
How many times
we got to do this?

04:14.950 --> 04:17.213
I'll let you know. Hey, hey!Hey, hey!

You're an ass!

07:18.916 --> 07:20.396
What'd you say?

The hell's wrong with you, huh?

07:36.107 --> 07:38.240
Nothing, nothing. It's nothing.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.504
Hey, him.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.334
Let's talk to him. Come on.Hey. We didn't get
your name earlier.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.074
What's your name?Hey.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.511
Justin Mathews.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.600
Is everyone out?
Did everyone get out?

07:50.644 --> 07:52.167
You know how this fire
got started?

07:52.210 --> 07:54.952
Please. I need to know. Did...

07:54.996 --> 07:56.519
did everyone get out?

07:56.563 --> 07:57.955
I-I think so, but we don't know

07:57.999 --> 07:58.826
everyone that lives
in that building yet.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.874
You smell like gasoline, Justin.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.354
That hand looks
like it's pretty burned up.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.446
No one was supposed
to be in there.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.926
Is that why you started
this fire, because there wasn't

08:11.969 --> 08:13.057
supposed to be anyone in there?

08:13.101 --> 08:14.232
You almost got us all killed!

08:14.276 --> 08:15.886
All right, all right. Hey.I didn't know.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.062
Give me the bag.
You're under arrest for arson.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.324
I didn't know.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.761
Hands behind your back.

08:20.804 --> 08:21.718
Give me the bag.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.546
Give me the bag.The backpack.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.548
Hey. Am I gonna find
anything in here, Justin?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.115
No.I'm gonna take it easy,

08:27.158 --> 08:28.769
but I got to cuff you up,
all right?

08:34.644 --> 08:36.864
Are you sure it was Manny?

08:36.907 --> 08:39.040
Yes, we're sure.
The M.E. used a DNA kit

08:39.083 --> 08:40.607
to identify the body.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.305
Any idea who killed him?

08:43.348 --> 08:44.915
I have no idea.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.743
Can I go now?

08:46.787 --> 08:47.962
No. Sit down.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.052
Look, why don't

08:51.095 --> 08:53.184
you stop with the innocent
victim routine, okay?

08:53.228 --> 08:55.404
We know he bought
and sold drugs.

08:55.447 --> 08:58.015
We know he was a member
of the Mexican Mafia.

08:58.059 --> 09:01.584
You look at a couple of tattoos
and you've got all the answers?

09:01.628 --> 09:03.586
That's why cops are dicks.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.066
Okay.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.894
Well, why don't
you enlighten us.

09:06.937 --> 09:10.288
So I end up like Manny,
floating down the East River?

09:10.332 --> 09:11.333
Floating down the East River
with a severed head.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.595
Don't forget

09:12.639 --> 09:13.857
that part.Just stop!

09:13.901 --> 09:15.685
You do realize that
your son or daughter,

09:15.729 --> 09:17.469
when they grow up,
is gonna want to know

09:17.513 --> 09:18.819
what happened to
their dad, right?

09:20.211 --> 09:23.519
Manny was a drug runner.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.870
But when I got pregnant,
he wanted out of that life.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.090
Manny's uncle
even hooked him up with a job

09:29.133 --> 09:31.048
at the carpenters union.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.616
Then, a few days ago,
Manny gets a text

09:33.660 --> 09:35.705
that the cartel wants him

09:35.749 --> 09:38.142
to deliver 40 kilos of cocaine

09:38.186 --> 09:42.103
from a ship container
in Red Hook up to a stash house

09:42.146 --> 09:43.626
in the Bronx.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.628
Manny turned
that job down.

09:45.672 --> 09:49.110
You don't turn
those kind of jobs down.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.590
What cartel?

09:55.246 --> 09:56.726
What cartel?

09:57.858 --> 09:59.990
Mano Sangriento.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.128
You know who it was
who reached out to him?

10:07.171 --> 10:09.260
Manny always kept those things
from me.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.653
But there's a man.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.829
He's in the gang, and he's...

10:12.873 --> 10:15.658
the hit man
for one of the cartels.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.051
This guy have a name?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.444
La Pantera.

10:19.488 --> 10:20.663
The Panther?

10:20.707 --> 10:23.753
Because he sneaks up behind you

10:23.797 --> 10:26.234
without a sound,

10:26.277 --> 10:28.845
and he's lethal.

10:34.198 --> 10:37.158
You're facing serious
felony charges, Justin.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.550
There was two family
members in that building

10:38.594 --> 10:40.117
at the time of the fire.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.076
One of them is in critical
condition-- a grandpa.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.251
N-No, no.Oh, you're so concerned

10:43.294 --> 10:44.644
about him,
why'd you set the fire

10:44.687 --> 10:45.819
in the first place?

10:45.862 --> 10:47.255
'Cause he said
no one was in there.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.387
Who's he?

10:51.302 --> 10:52.434
Who said?!

10:53.696 --> 10:55.306
No one.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.265
But you just said,
hesaid no one was in there.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.354
I want a lawyer.

10:59.397 --> 11:00.485
Get up. Let's go.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.578
DANNY:
The Panther wasn't

11:06.622 --> 11:08.058
in the system, by the way.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.799
Because he doesn't
have a record.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.801
His real name
is Luis Delgado.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.368
How do you know?

11:13.411 --> 11:15.805
I just got off the phone
with a friend from the DEA.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.372
Delgado's on
their radar, too.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.895
A friend at the DEA?

11:18.939 --> 11:20.505
This wouldn't happen
to be the friend

11:20.549 --> 11:21.855
you were dating
from the DEA,

11:21.898 --> 11:23.770
the one with the
Mustang, would it?

11:23.813 --> 11:25.946
Might be him.
Oh, my God.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.817
You're back together
with that clown?

11:27.861 --> 11:29.906
No, but I do miss
that Mustang.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.299
:
Oh.
Danny.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.475
No. Hey, date whoever
you want. I don't care.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.739
Come on. I know the look.

11:36.783 --> 11:40.221
According to the DEA,

11:40.264 --> 11:42.614
Delgado's the one
that set your house on fire.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.506
The commissioner is waiting
for you in his office.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.432
Oh, you don't have
to do all that.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.789
Sit down,
Officer Reagan.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.853
I know you have reservations
about me riding with Eddie.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.724
A little more than reservations.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.161
But as you've pointed out,

12:51.205 --> 12:52.946
there's nothing
in the book that says you can't.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.730
That's right.There is

12:54.774 --> 12:56.819
one thing the book says
has to happen, though.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.560
Our C.O. has to be informed.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.779
And has been?

12:59.822 --> 13:00.997
Haven't had the opportunity.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.477
Then find one.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.830
Or you want me to?

13:07.874 --> 13:09.789
No, I'll tell him.
We'll tell him.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.835
Forthwith.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.795
I promise you...
my riding with Eddie

13:15.838 --> 13:17.797
won't affect my performance
on the job.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.017
Why'd you get into it
with the firefighter today?

13:21.061 --> 13:22.845
I was going back in
for my partner.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.761
Your fiancée.Partner. As I would
for any partner.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.937
Come on, Jamie. Don't lawyer me.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.025
I'm not lawyering you.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.984
Yeah, you are.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.638
There's nothing on the books
about riding with a fiancée.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.031
That's a fact.
I'm asking you

13:35.075 --> 13:36.467
to trust me, trust us.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.861
No, you're asking me
to bend the rules for you.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.689
There are no rules, Dad!

13:40.732 --> 13:42.647
There isn't a commanding officer

13:42.691 --> 13:44.867
in this city
who would keep two people

13:44.911 --> 13:46.869
who are engaged to be married
as partners.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.958
You know that.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.439
I don'tknow that, no.That's why you haven't
told your C.O.

13:51.482 --> 13:54.485
Why can't you just trust
my judgment?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.270
You're the commissioner's son,
and you are waiting

13:56.313 --> 13:59.099
for me to make
an exception for you.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.883
That's not true.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.194
So I look the other way,
you get married,

14:07.237 --> 14:09.936
the two of you get taken out
in the same action.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.199
What do you want me
to do with your kids?

14:30.957 --> 14:32.610
:
Aah.

14:43.099 --> 14:46.363
Congratulations
on your promotion.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.061
Thank you.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.541
You really came all the way
down here just to tell me that?

14:50.585 --> 14:51.803
Absolutely.

14:51.847 --> 14:54.502
Not. Why don't you
tell me why

14:54.545 --> 14:56.025
you're really here.
Because God knows

14:56.069 --> 14:58.027
everyone in this family has
an ulterior motive

14:58.071 --> 14:59.637
for just about everything.

14:59.681 --> 15:02.162
I just wanted to know what's
going on with Justin Mathews.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.380
The tenant,

15:03.424 --> 15:05.774
Mr. Fowler, the grandfather,

15:05.817 --> 15:07.776
died of smoke inhalation,

15:07.819 --> 15:09.909
so the charges
against Justin

15:09.952 --> 15:14.217
are being bumped up
to murder two and arson.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.740
You can't charge him
with murder.

15:15.784 --> 15:16.741
I can,

15:16.785 --> 15:18.613
and I have.
Whether he thought

15:18.656 --> 15:20.571
the building was empty or not
is irrelevant, Jamie.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.269
It's a felony murder.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.358
In commission of an arson,

15:24.401 --> 15:26.012
he caused a death.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.665
I think
someone put him up to it.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.971
What are you talking about?

15:29.015 --> 15:30.625
At least give us a chance,

15:30.668 --> 15:32.714
before you charge him
with murder, to look into it.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.803
Okay, see, this is what
you and Danny don't understand.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.458
I can't just trust your gut
every time you walk in here.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.808
I've got a guy
who admits to lighting

15:39.851 --> 15:42.202
a building on fire, I've got
evidence that proves that.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.031
I can't just sit on that.You can charge him with arson.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.163
Uh...That's enough to hold him,
and it'll give us six days

15:47.207 --> 15:48.512
before you have to indict him.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.253
Perfect.
I cannot play around
with murder charges

15:50.297 --> 15:52.777
because my baby brother
has a hunch!

15:52.821 --> 15:54.475
Thank you.
Ugh!

16:09.533 --> 16:11.013
My detail ready?

16:11.057 --> 16:12.667
There's a ten-minute delay.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.408
For what?

16:14.451 --> 16:16.453
Me.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.153
Okay.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.596
Look, you're married to a cop.
What do you think?

16:28.639 --> 16:30.772
That it's not the issue here.
We're not partnered on the job.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.513
Thank you.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.211
Okay, what do you think
of the issue here?

16:35.255 --> 16:38.171
I think an interim order
prohibiting partners

16:38.214 --> 16:40.260
from having
a romantic relationship,

16:40.303 --> 16:42.914
coming from you, is a mistake.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.613
Because?

16:45.656 --> 16:47.832
I know you know
the answer to that.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.792
Because I'd be
singling out my son

16:50.835 --> 16:52.750
as much as if
I looked the other way.

16:52.794 --> 16:53.882
Exactly.

16:53.925 --> 16:57.712
Maybe tell Sid
to put a pin in that?

16:57.755 --> 17:00.454
No maybe. And the moment
I'm back at my desk.

17:00.497 --> 17:03.326
But...

17:03.370 --> 17:06.025
there is no way,
no way you are saying

17:06.068 --> 17:08.549
couples riding together
is a good idea?

17:08.592 --> 17:10.768
There's a lot of valid reasoning
in forbidding it.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.422
Thank you.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.294
But maybe to Jamie's
side, there's also

17:14.337 --> 17:16.861
no data or evidence,
much less an actual rule.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.472
It's just a tradition.

17:18.515 --> 17:21.301
Some traditions are born
of common sense.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.999
Yes, like Catholic priests
being forbidden to marry,

17:24.043 --> 17:25.653
because common sense tells us

17:25.696 --> 17:27.568
you couldn't possibly
tend the flock unless

17:27.611 --> 17:29.396
your personal life
was utterly devoid

17:29.439 --> 17:32.094
of the comforts of human touch
and companionship.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.968
Not the same thing, Abigail.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.973
No, it's not the same thing,

17:42.017 --> 17:44.150
but it's not
that distant a cousin, either.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.155
Tell my detail I'm ready.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.461
Yes, sir.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.642
Yeah. I got it. Thanks.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.122
ABETEMARCO:
Sauerkraut,

18:00.166 --> 18:02.037
onions, mustard and ketchup.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.952
Thank you.

18:05.910 --> 18:10.524
So, uh, what exactly
does this bump mean?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.569
Well, I'll be supervising
50 attorneys,

18:12.613 --> 18:15.137
and more time with the D.A.,

18:15.181 --> 18:18.053
and any big press case--
it will go through me.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.795
That's great.Yeah, and you will be
exclusive to me.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.797
That's like hundreds
of cases, Erin.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.364
I can't handle that on my own.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.713
Let me tell you something.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.454
I've been with the D.A.'s office
for 15 years,

18:27.497 --> 18:29.847
and I have a lot
of acquaintances,

18:29.891 --> 18:31.936
and a lot of coworkers,

18:31.980 --> 18:34.809
and there's only one person
I truly trust, and that's you.

18:36.985 --> 18:39.770
How's that kale

18:39.814 --> 18:42.730
Mow a lawn, rake it up and pour
dressing on it? This is brutal.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.343
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.171
Congrats on
the promotion.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.912
I need a warrant.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.043
I'm fine. And you?

18:52.087 --> 18:53.697
For what

18:53.741 --> 18:55.090
and who?Luis Delgado.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.745
He's the guy
who set my house on fire.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.268
How do you know?

18:59.312 --> 19:01.183
I know because a witness said

19:01.227 --> 19:04.273
that a drug runner and hit man
from Mano Sangriento

19:04.317 --> 19:06.406
nicknamed "Panther,"
AKA Luis Delgado,

19:06.449 --> 19:08.799
set a cop's house on fire
last year.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.323
We also have
reason to believe

19:10.366 --> 19:13.152
that this is the same person
who killed Manuel Sanchez.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.327
That's the floater.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.719
Exactly.
Has that

19:15.763 --> 19:16.851
been ruled a homicide?

19:16.894 --> 19:18.896
No. Without the head,
it's technically

19:18.940 --> 19:21.421
"Causes Undetermined
Pending Police Investigation."

19:21.464 --> 19:24.206
Until the M.E. rules it
a homicide,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.817
I cannot give you a warrant
based on a hunch.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.645
It's not a hunch.

19:28.689 --> 19:31.213
And you know
that chopping off a guy's head

19:31.257 --> 19:34.173
is the preferred method of
homicide of the Mexican Mafia.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.349
Maybe it got severed
by a boat propeller.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.089
Really?

19:38.133 --> 19:39.439
It's possible.

19:39.482 --> 19:40.527
Really?

19:40.570 --> 19:41.963
I don't think

19:42.006 --> 19:44.008
that's what happened, but...Exactly.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.836
You gonna help me or not?

19:45.880 --> 19:47.708
It cannot look
like I'm doing you favors.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.884
The judge will never
sign off on it.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.494
Right, because getting
a murderer off the street

19:51.538 --> 19:52.887
would be doing a favor for me.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.845
The facts don't add up, Danny.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.891
No. You know what
doesn't add up is

19:56.934 --> 19:59.154
that of all the times
that I've had to come here

19:59.198 --> 20:01.374
and beg, plead and grovel,

20:01.417 --> 20:02.853
it would be when I was
coming to get help

20:02.897 --> 20:04.420
to catch the son of a bitch

20:04.464 --> 20:07.597
who burned down the house
where my kids and my wife slept!

20:10.992 --> 20:12.689
But I guess not.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.922
Mr. Delgado?

20:29.967 --> 20:31.534
We really can't come in
here without a warrant.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.319
Door was open.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.277
Somebody could be in danger.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.974
It's clear.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.454
Come on, take a look around.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.342
DANNY:
Police! Don't move!

20:56.385 --> 20:59.823
Don't move, or I'll blow your
brains all over that wall.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.085
Get your hands up!

21:01.129 --> 21:02.435
Now! Now!

21:05.742 --> 21:07.962
Come on, get 'em up!

21:08.005 --> 21:09.746
You okay, partner?

21:09.790 --> 21:10.965
I am now.You can't
arrest me.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.141
I haven't broken any laws.Yeah, you did.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.403
You assaulted a
police officer.

21:14.447 --> 21:16.710
You didn't even
identify yourselves as cops.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.451
I'm Detective
Daniel Reagan.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.235
That ring a bell?

21:21.976 --> 21:23.673
Let's go.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.985
You have no right
to keep me here.Yeah, I do.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.334
You assaulted
a police officer.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.944
Now, sit down and shut up.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.382
You guys came in my house
without a warrant even.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.079
But I get it,

21:38.122 --> 21:40.429
that's what you cops do:
you lie to get what you want.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.822
You're known as the Panther.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.476
I've never heard
that name before.How about

21:43.519 --> 21:45.739
Manuel Sanchez?
You ever heard that name before?

21:45.782 --> 21:47.741
No.
Where were you
yesterday

21:47.784 --> 21:49.308
between the hours
of 12:00 and 5:00?

21:49.351 --> 21:50.874
I was home,
reading the penal code

21:50.918 --> 21:52.789
so I know when my rights
are being violated.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.574
You torched a cop's house
last year.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.097
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.708
Fine, then you can write down
that you know nothing.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.057
I'm gonna go get
a legal pad

22:00.101 --> 22:01.407
and a pen.

22:11.155 --> 22:14.245
Your house went up
like a stack of kindling.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.513
My only regret:

22:20.556 --> 22:23.603
that your family wasn't
in it at the time.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.825
Hey! Hey! Hey!

22:28.869 --> 22:30.087
Cut it out!Son of a bitch

22:30.131 --> 22:31.828
just admitted
to burning my house down.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.396
Knock it off!He just admitted
to torching my house!

22:34.440 --> 22:36.398
I didn't say anything.Yes, you did,
you son of a bitch!

22:36.442 --> 22:39.270
Danny, I told you,
we have to do everything

22:39.314 --> 22:41.229
by the book on this one.

22:54.503 --> 22:59.247
Did you admit to torching
Detective Reagan's house?

22:59.290 --> 23:00.117
I never said that.

23:00.161 --> 23:01.118
Yes, he did.
He's lying.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.511
Danny.We've already
answered

23:02.555 --> 23:04.252
the question about your
brother's house, Counselor.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.514
Move on.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.473
You attacked Detective Baez.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.692
I thought she was a burglar.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.433
Detective Baez and
Detective Reagan

23:11.477 --> 23:12.869
were trespassing
on my client's property

23:12.913 --> 23:14.741
without a
search warrant.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.612
They did not identify
themselves as police.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.180
Detective Reagan accosted him.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.355
He murdered
Manuel Sanchez.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.922
Oh. I'm sorry.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.881
I missed the part where you
have any evidence of that.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.538
I've had enough.
You cannot hold

23:29.582 --> 23:31.453
my client with
no evidence against him

23:31.497 --> 23:32.715
and an illegal search.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.804
He has no priors.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.328
We are not answering
any more questions.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.374
A moment, Counselor.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.423
It's your word against his.
Now, if you wanted

23:44.466 --> 23:45.989
to interrogate him
about a murder,

23:46.033 --> 23:48.209
you should have videotaped it
like you're supposed to.

23:48.252 --> 23:50.298
Then we would have
a confession on tape.Oh, I'm sorry.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.213
Somebody was in the box,

23:52.256 --> 23:53.910
so I had to talk to him
in the boss's office.
Okay.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.912
What the hell's the difference?
He admitted it!Okay, fine!

23:55.956 --> 23:59.133
Fine. I can't do anything
without a confession.

23:59.176 --> 24:01.440
He did confess.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.485
He told me he burned
down my house.

24:03.529 --> 24:04.921
Prove it.I don't have

24:04.965 --> 24:06.923
to prove it;
he admitted it!I cannot go

24:06.967 --> 24:09.448
to the jury and ask them
to take your word for it.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.537
Yes, you can.No, I can't.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.800
I will not be able to find
12 people in New York City

24:13.843 --> 24:15.715
who is going to take
a cop's word

24:15.758 --> 24:17.586
over a man who has no record.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.414
Now, cut him loose.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.122
What are we doing here?

24:32.166 --> 24:34.037
The detectives have
the case. We can't...You know what?

24:34.081 --> 24:36.518
I'm getting tired of people
telling me what I can't do.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.911
Excuse me.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.347
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know anything

24:39.390 --> 24:41.305
about this building that burned
across the street?

24:41.349 --> 24:43.003
All I know is that poor family
went through the mill.

24:43.046 --> 24:44.483
How so?

24:44.526 --> 24:47.050
Landlord used to turn off
the heat in the winter,

24:47.094 --> 24:49.618
turn off their water
and electricity.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.141
What about the other tenants?

24:51.185 --> 24:53.535
The owner got rid
of all the other tenants.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.058
They were the last holdouts.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.799
He really
wanted them

24:56.843 --> 24:59.367
to vacate
so he could sell the place.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.245
That's a motive.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.513
I talked to the prior tenants
who lived in the building.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.079
They were all harassed
into vacating,

25:16.123 --> 25:18.081
because the owner wanted
to sell the building.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.083
The Fowler family were
the last holdouts.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.911
Do we know anything
about the owner?

25:21.955 --> 25:23.696
See, that's where
it gets interesting.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.307
The building
is listed as an LLC

25:26.350 --> 25:29.310
called Fergus Limited.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.051
So I went to the
Buildings Department.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.705
It's owned by
a Samuel Arpel,

25:32.748 --> 25:35.359
who used to be married
to Linda Mathews.

25:35.403 --> 25:36.709
Mathews?

25:36.752 --> 25:38.711
She was pregnant
when he divorced her.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.887
She had a boy
she named Justin.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.932
They shared joint custody,

25:42.976 --> 25:45.892
but he, uh... he kept
his mother's last name.

25:45.935 --> 25:49.156
So the father put him up
to setting that fire?

25:50.287 --> 25:52.028
It looks that way.

25:52.072 --> 25:54.117
You think you can coax
him into coming in?

25:54.161 --> 25:56.555
I can be very charming,
you know that.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.295
I have no doubt.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.951
ALL: Bless us, O Lord,
and these, Thy gifts,

26:01.995 --> 26:04.606
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.303
Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.

26:15.965 --> 26:18.272
Eddie, would you like
any cornbread?

26:18.315 --> 26:20.013
Yes. Thank you.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.188
Eddie?

26:21.231 --> 26:22.406
Hmm?

26:22.450 --> 26:24.104
Welcome.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.496
Thank you, Commissioner.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.107
Frank.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.499
Or "Dad."

26:31.459 --> 26:32.982
So, do you cook?

26:33.026 --> 26:33.983
Oh, me?

26:34.027 --> 26:34.984
Yeah.Uh, yeah.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.551
But not like this.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.206
This... is amazing.

26:39.249 --> 26:40.337
Yeah, usually.

26:40.381 --> 26:41.600
NICKY:
Just don't use your phone

26:41.643 --> 26:43.427
or iPad at the table.

26:43.471 --> 26:44.559
SEAN:
Or curse.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.865
They hate it when you curse.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.736
I'm pretty sure she
gets it already, guys.

26:47.780 --> 26:50.478
Really looks great, Erin.
I love mashed potatoes.

26:50.521 --> 26:53.089
Thanks. It's my
mom's recipe.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.743
Do you have
any actual proof

26:54.787 --> 26:56.745
that Mom actually
made these potatoes?

26:56.789 --> 26:58.138
You know,

26:58.181 --> 26:59.182
evidence?

27:00.662 --> 27:02.621
What?I'm just saying.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.101
Danny.Well, Dad, should we
just take Erin's word for it,

27:05.145 --> 27:08.409
based on, uh,
I don't know, a hunch?

27:08.452 --> 27:11.368
My word on mashed potatoes does
not need to hold up in court.

27:11.412 --> 27:12.805
Whatever.JAMIE: Well,
from where I sit

27:12.848 --> 27:14.458
at this table,
you can be accused

27:14.502 --> 27:15.721
of breaking rules
that don't even exist.

27:17.592 --> 27:20.508
If you're talking about what
I think you're talking about,

27:20.551 --> 27:23.250
a rule can exist
without being in a book.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.555
NICKY:
But breaking an
unwritten rule

27:24.599 --> 27:26.427
is pretty hard
to prosecute, now.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.951
ERIN:
Legally, yes.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.953
But not practically.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.346
HENRY: All right,
let's everybody just...

27:32.389 --> 27:33.826
take a step back.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.392
It gets like this sometimes.

27:35.436 --> 27:36.263
JACK:
Not always, but...

27:36.306 --> 27:37.699
sometimes.

27:37.743 --> 27:38.874
Most of the time.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.702
Maybe you want
to chime in, too, Pop,

27:40.746 --> 27:42.356
about whether Eddie and I
should ride together,

27:42.399 --> 27:44.053
about breaking rules
that don't exist.Jamie.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.795
Jamie, I happen to agree
with your father.

27:46.839 --> 27:50.581
Mixing romance and police work,
never a good idea.

27:50.625 --> 27:51.931
Romance

27:51.974 --> 27:53.715
Eddie, am I
romancing you at work?

27:53.759 --> 27:55.282
I... Mm...

27:55.325 --> 27:57.023
JAMIE: Because as far
as I could tell, all we're doing

27:57.066 --> 27:58.720
is our jobs,
which is what we've always done.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.243
All right, quit
being so sensitive.

28:00.287 --> 28:01.984
Gramps is just sayin'.

28:02.028 --> 28:04.508
Who's calling who sensitive

28:04.552 --> 28:07.860
Why? Because I want
to see justice done

28:07.903 --> 28:08.643
No, you don't.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.036
Not at the table.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.080
Not my choice.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.429
It's my victim's
girlfriend.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.474
Reagan.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.434
Hello

28:17.478 --> 28:18.871
You okay?

28:21.743 --> 28:23.179
I don't think she's okay.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.877
And do you know why?

28:24.920 --> 28:26.705
:
You son of a bitch.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.315
Because you messed
with the wrong man.

28:28.358 --> 28:29.359
Delgado...

28:33.059 --> 28:35.322
We should have charged Delgado
when you had the chance.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.803
You know I couldn't.You could've and you should've.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.641
This is really good.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.385
What are the little green bits
in the mashed potatoes?

28:55.429 --> 28:57.257
Is that parsley?

29:01.827 --> 29:03.524
Mmm.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.744
Really gives it a zing.

29:15.841 --> 29:16.972
So, I thought family dinner

29:17.016 --> 29:18.713
was more, like,
a warm family get-together

29:18.757 --> 29:20.759
once a week--
catch up, break bread.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.630
I didn't say we don't
disagree about stuff.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.806
:
Disagree?

29:24.850 --> 29:26.590
Don't you think
it's a little more serious

29:26.634 --> 29:27.591
than just disagreeing?

29:29.680 --> 29:31.944
We need to think
about not partnering together.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.293
What?

29:33.336 --> 29:35.904
It'll solve the problems
with your dad and...

29:35.948 --> 29:37.993
Eddie, you don't want
to ride together anymore?

29:38.037 --> 29:39.690
No, it's just your dad
clearly has a problem

29:39.734 --> 29:40.735
with us riding together.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.215
You can't just
cave every time

29:42.258 --> 29:44.173
you don't agree with
somebody in my family.

29:44.217 --> 29:46.306
And you can't ignore it
like this is gonna go away.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.308
Do you really want to hide
the fact that we're engaged

29:48.351 --> 29:49.700
from the department

29:49.744 --> 29:51.267
and fight with your dad
just to ride together?

29:51.311 --> 29:53.704
I thought that's
what we both wanted.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.969
I just want you.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.709
♪

30:02.365 --> 30:04.237
HENRY:
Jamie feels strongly

30:04.280 --> 30:07.283
that since there are no rules,
they should ride together.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.329
I know my son, Pop.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.288
I know the reasoning part of him
would agree that riding together

30:12.332 --> 30:14.421
became a handicap
when love and sex and all

30:14.464 --> 30:16.379
got in the car with him.

30:16.423 --> 30:20.514
And love and sex and all tends
to push reason out of the car.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.995
So why is he being so stubborn?
What am I missing here?

30:23.038 --> 30:24.866
More than usual.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.564
You completely ignored
the "new haircut" protocol

30:27.608 --> 30:29.740
when he brought her in
and broke the news.

30:31.090 --> 30:33.179
What are you talking about?

30:35.442 --> 30:37.052
Say Baker shows up

30:37.096 --> 30:39.228
tomorrow morning with
a radical new haircut

30:39.272 --> 30:40.839
that you think is terrible.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.144
What do you say to her?

30:44.146 --> 30:46.235
I don't know.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.716
"I'm sorry, it'll grow out"?

30:48.759 --> 30:50.979
No.
No?

30:51.023 --> 30:53.503
You say, "Nice haircut.
You look great."

30:53.547 --> 30:55.679
I do?

30:55.723 --> 30:57.464
Because what's done is done.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.509
All you can do
now is be kind.

30:59.553 --> 31:03.078
Look, I'm happy for Jamie,
I'm happy for Eddie.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.037
But in the moment,

31:05.080 --> 31:07.561
you took their news
like a bad haircut.

31:07.604 --> 31:09.302
You went straight
to what was wrong

31:09.345 --> 31:10.999
about them riding together.

31:13.393 --> 31:16.918
And that's gonna take
some time to fade away.

31:22.489 --> 31:25.361
Anything else I'm missing?

31:25.405 --> 31:28.277
That we have another
cop in our family.

31:28.321 --> 31:32.325
That we now have another
reason to stop our hearts

31:32.368 --> 31:36.198
when we hear "officer down"
go out over the radio.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.872
I'm sorry.
Not your fault.
Warrant or no warrant,

31:57.916 --> 31:59.830
I should have had a radio
car sitting on her place.

31:59.874 --> 32:02.572
Come on, Danny. Her boyfriend
was part of Mano Sangriento.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.400
She knew the danger going in.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.054
Yeah, well, now this guy's
got two bodies on him,

32:06.098 --> 32:07.708
and I got nothing.

32:07.751 --> 32:10.450
I got no hair, no fibers,
no DNA, no witnesses.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.713
Well, Delgado is smart,
and he knows the law,

32:12.756 --> 32:14.280
which is why
he's never been caught,

32:14.323 --> 32:15.803
so we need to be smarter.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.197
What do you mean "we"?
What are you getting at?

32:18.240 --> 32:19.850
Well, we don't have him
on the murders,

32:19.894 --> 32:21.591
but Melissa said
Sanchez was killed

32:21.635 --> 32:23.898
because he refused
to do a drug run.
Right.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.553
So, what if we intercept
the next exchange,

32:26.596 --> 32:28.337
get him on drugs?

32:28.381 --> 32:30.470
I mean, it's something.Well, that's great,

32:30.513 --> 32:31.862
except I don't know
where it's going down,

32:31.906 --> 32:33.560
when it's going down,

32:33.603 --> 32:35.301
I got no way to find out
how it's going down.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.390
Here's a warrant
for the text messages

32:37.433 --> 32:39.261
on Delgado's cell phone
after the murders.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.744
Get to work.

32:55.669 --> 32:58.280
Black Escalade just pulled in.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.412
Two males in front.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.243
Silver Tahoe just pulled in.

33:09.726 --> 33:10.814
It's him.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.207
That's Delgado.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.211
Move on my command.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.086
Go. Go!

33:24.393 --> 33:26.482
Go, go, go!

33:26.526 --> 33:27.614
Police! Get
on the ground!

33:27.657 --> 33:28.571
Put your hands in
the air right now!

33:28.615 --> 33:30.138
You heard me!

33:30.182 --> 33:31.966
Get on the ground with
your hands in the air!

33:32.010 --> 33:33.228
Right now!

33:35.752 --> 33:36.753
On the ground!

33:36.797 --> 33:39.887
Get 'em up.
Keep 'em up.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.323
Gotcha, kitty-cat.

33:41.367 --> 33:43.847
What you think.That's what I know.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.328
No, you don't have
that kind of luck.How's that?

33:46.372 --> 33:48.722
First, her house burns up,
then her chopper goes down?

33:50.550 --> 33:52.856
That's some pretty bad mojo
you're carrying around.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.950
Get him on his feet.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.477
Turn him around.

34:07.741 --> 34:10.091
You're a real
funny guy, Delgado.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.354
Turn around.

34:15.923 --> 34:18.578
We appreciate
your cooperation, sir.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.145
You're free to go.

34:22.234 --> 34:23.496
What are you talking about?

34:23.539 --> 34:25.454
DANNY:
We're done here,
but we couldn't

34:25.498 --> 34:27.717
have pulled it off without you,
so thanks for the help.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.632
What are you talking about?
What are you doing, huh?

34:29.676 --> 34:31.634
We're done here.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.071
See you later.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.570
Yeah, that's right.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.659
[man shouting
in Spanish]
Yup.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.313
You know what
you're doing?
Hope so.

34:58.357 --> 35:01.142
You had him. You
just let him walk.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.926
Hey, everyone hates
a snitch, right?

35:09.629 --> 35:11.152
We just got a confession.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.415
Nice work, Counselor.

35:13.459 --> 35:16.244
I knew he would fold
in order to protect his kid.

35:16.288 --> 35:19.508
In my experience,
most dads, even criminals,

35:19.552 --> 35:22.424
would do anything
to protect their kids.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.818
Something you
want to say?

35:24.861 --> 35:27.690
The only reason why Dad doesn't
want you riding with Eddie

35:27.734 --> 35:30.432
is because he's afraid
that will put you in danger.

35:30.476 --> 35:33.348
He's not worried
about department policy.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.785
He's worried
about your safety.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.745
I just wish sometimes
he'd cut me some slack.

35:38.788 --> 35:41.008
Well...

35:41.051 --> 35:43.315
maybe you should
cut him a little.

35:51.888 --> 35:53.629
WOMAN:
I called the desk.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.457
They said a supervisor
is on the way.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.590
It looks like there's
a wallet in his pocket,

35:57.633 --> 36:00.332
but I didn't want to check for
I.D. until the M.E. got here.

36:00.375 --> 36:01.550
It's all right.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.291
Pretty sure we know
who it is anyway.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.207
Delgado?

36:06.251 --> 36:07.948
Good a guess as any.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.390
You okay?

36:16.522 --> 36:18.567
Nothing is ever over.

36:23.877 --> 36:27.402
You know, if there's one thing
I've learned in the last year--

36:27.446 --> 36:29.665
closure's overrated.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.589
This was meant for
your new office.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.983
Well, it will look good
in this one.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.507
Oh. How about over here?

36:46.856 --> 36:49.729
Ah. Yeah.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.034
Perfect.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.994
I saw the DD-5s
for Mano Sangriento.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.691
You applied

36:55.735 --> 36:57.606
for a warrant
for Delgado's phone.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.087
And the judge signed it.And when the drugs

37:00.130 --> 37:03.656
were intercepted, six Sangriento
members were arrested,

37:03.699 --> 37:05.919
the seventh went free.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.399
It was my understanding

37:07.442 --> 37:09.052
that Detective Reagan and Baez
were hoping

37:09.096 --> 37:10.793
Delgado would lead them

37:10.837 --> 37:13.274
to someone higher
in the food chain.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.276
Well, that's a theory.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.584
Another is that
it gave the impression

37:18.627 --> 37:20.542
that he was cooperating
with the police,

37:20.586 --> 37:23.023
which led to his execution.

37:23.066 --> 37:26.548
Or he was executed
because he was a drug runner,

37:26.592 --> 37:29.203
and a hit man
most of his adult life.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.292
What do cops call that?

37:31.336 --> 37:33.947
Public service homicide?

37:33.990 --> 37:35.644
Something like that.

37:39.082 --> 37:41.041
Don't overwater it.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.522
That is the mistake
most people make.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.611
If you keep the balance
just right,

37:45.654 --> 37:48.483
they last a lot longer.

37:48.527 --> 37:51.269
I will keep that in mind.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.401
And thank you very much.

37:53.445 --> 37:56.143
Good night, Erin.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.036
Hey.
Hey.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.779
Good stuff.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.869
Yeah. You owe me 68 bucks.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.263
I do?
Yeah.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.047
It's a congratulations present
from you to me.

38:34.224 --> 38:35.922
Look, Jamie...

38:38.098 --> 38:40.361
I couldn't be more thrilled
for you and Eddie.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.668
If somehow you got
the idea that...

38:42.711 --> 38:45.192
No, not congratulations
about that.

38:45.235 --> 38:47.368
Okay.

38:49.762 --> 38:52.155
Did you know that they, uh,
posted the results

38:52.199 --> 38:53.853
for the sergeants exam today?

38:53.896 --> 38:57.552
Oh, yeah. I think
it's on my desk somewhere.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.249
But you didn't look
at the scoreboard?

38:59.293 --> 39:01.208
This about Eddie?

39:01.251 --> 39:03.253
She did okay, but, uh, no.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.168
It's about me.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.866
Number one.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.744
You took it?

39:15.788 --> 39:19.139
Yeah, I took it, and I...
I came out on top.

39:19.182 --> 39:20.401
Why didn't you tell me?

39:20.445 --> 39:22.360
With what we were going
through over it?

39:22.403 --> 39:25.667
Well, maybe it could've saved us
both some pushing and shoving.

39:25.711 --> 39:26.929
Yeah, but maybe
you would've thought

39:26.973 --> 39:28.627
that I took it
on account of the pushing,

39:28.670 --> 39:31.194
which would've been
a feather in your cap,

39:31.238 --> 39:34.241
one I didn't feel
like giving you.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.425
Congratulations.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.645
Thank you.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.783
You know, you don't have
to accept the promotion.

39:54.827 --> 39:56.785
It is your choice.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.700
And mine alone.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.530
Yes.

40:04.663 --> 40:06.795
I'm taking the promotion.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.933
And you know...

40:13.976 --> 40:15.674
that means
you can't ride with Eddie.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.458
You know that, right?

40:17.502 --> 40:20.461
I know that, yeah,
and so does she.

40:24.944 --> 40:27.337
So, does that mean
that I have your blessing?

40:32.691 --> 40:34.388
I couldn't be happier for you.

40:35.694 --> 40:38.174
I'm not talking
about the promotion.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.179
Neither am I.
