take drives in these backwoods,

02:45.433 --> 02:46.966
and we're really not that far
from my house.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.502
We're only
about five minutes away,

02:48.636 --> 02:49.903
but five minutes away,

you on Broadway,

03:10.123 --> 03:11.959

in your orbit.
-Right, right.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.661
It's really, really cool,
and to be here

03:13.794 --> 03:15.963
because we're about

03:16.096 --> 03:17.598
and your daddy so happy...

03:17.698 --> 03:19.800
-Yeah.
-...that just makes me
so excited.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.669
UTKARSH:
My parents came here
from a different country.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.203
-NISCHELLE: Right.
-In 1980.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.373
My parents are PhD biochemists.-
-Okay.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.040
nd they come from an era whereA

03:27.174 --> 03:28.841
academics is how you got out of

03:28.976 --> 03:30.844
-whatever situation you were in.
-Right. Right.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.514
And they were both
really fortunate

03:33.647 --> 03:35.883
to have the right pieces
around them,

03:36.016 --> 03:40.488
the right mentors, the right
teachers where they could excel.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.022
-Mm-hmm.
-And then I come along.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.992
And at 14 or 15,
just kind of know in my bones,I

03:45.125 --> 03:47.895
-whether I like it or not,
that I want to perform.
-Yes.

03:48.028 --> 03:52.232
They're like, "We came to this
country for you to do what?!"

03:52.366 --> 03:53.901
This, like,
child of immigrants was like,

03:54.034 --> 03:55.469
-"Hey, I want to be an actor..."
-Mm.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.038
...at a time when people
that looked like me

03:58.171 --> 04:00.207
-weren't really acting.
-Mm-hmm.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.875
And, um, I just remember

04:02.009 --> 04:04.244
they just literally
had blind faith in me.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.247
And luckily,
t's paid off, at least so far.i

04:07.381 --> 04:09.350
Do you remember
the very first time

04:09.483 --> 04:11.419
your parents saw you
in a production?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.554
You know, I remember the first
time my parents actually looked

04:13.687 --> 04:15.589
at what I did and were like,

04:15.723 --> 04:20.394
-"What this guy's doing
is actually worthwhile."
-Uh-huh.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.430
UTKARSH:
Freestyle Love Supreme
that just won a Special Tony

04:22.563 --> 04:23.997
-on Broadway.
My favorite. Yes. My favorite.-

04:24.097 --> 04:26.334
UTKARSH:
Um, and they saw me do that.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.436
And they were like, "Oh,
the stuff you do with music,

04:28.569 --> 04:30.571
"the stuff...
the way your mind works--

04:30.704 --> 04:33.173
it's creative,
but it is a science."

04:33.273 --> 04:34.942
-That was just
a goose bump moment.
-They-they saw...

04:35.075 --> 04:36.744
-They... Well.
-That was just
a light bulb moment.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.613
Yeah, they saw, like,
it for what it was,

04:39.747 --> 04:41.615
which is something
that's not easy to do.

04:41.749 --> 04:45.386
The truth is, not everybody
is as lucky as I was to know

04:45.519 --> 04:47.120
-what they want to do
at such a young age, right?
-Right.

04:47.254 --> 04:50.724
And then to also have
the support of my parents going

04:50.858 --> 04:54.294
into something that was a huge
unknown is-- was a real gift.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.865
-Yeah.
-If I can give any amount
of that back today,

04:57.965 --> 05:01.134
that would be a gift
for them and for me, too.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.269
NISCHELLE:
What did you tell them

05:02.403 --> 05:03.971
about this?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.473
They know
something's going to happen.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.308
-Okay.
-But they don't know what.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.810
-Okay.
-And I'm excited, too,

05:09.943 --> 05:11.745
because I've never done anything
like this.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.647
My mom is going
to get very excited.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.916
Oh! I can't wait to hug her.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.317
-Yeah.
-Is your mama a hugger?

05:17.451 --> 05:18.919
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, good.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.656

This is going
to be really exciting.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.501

How are you?
Are you okay with this?

05:46.614 --> 05:49.016
Leaving it all
in this man's hands?

05:49.149 --> 05:51.685
I mean, we're a little bit
nervous, but I think

05:51.819 --> 05:53.487
I completely trust you guys.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.122
So we are going to send you

-We are packed. We are packed.
-You're ready to go?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.160
-Where's your stuff?
-Here. It's right inside.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.829

06:01.962 --> 06:03.464
-Come, let's do it.
-NISCHELLE: Utkarsh booked

-No peeking.
-We're not gonna be here, so...

06:06.700 --> 06:07.935
-Promise?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.438
I know, but no drive-bys,
you know?

06:10.538 --> 06:12.840
They have no idea what
to expect when they return.

06:12.973 --> 06:13.841
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.275

-Hey.

06:29.890 --> 06:30.791
SABRINA: I've seen Utkarsh
on Pitch Perfect,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.225
and I'm so excited

06:32.359 --> 06:33.293
to finally meet him in person.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.495
I heard he is such a hoot.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.396
Hey, Utkarsh.
Good to meet you.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.966
UTKARSH:
Coming home
is like instant nostalgia.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.134
Just the smell of the house,
the feel of the stairs

06:41.234 --> 06:42.736
when you're walking down them,

06:42.870 --> 06:44.905
knowing that the door creaks
every time it opens.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.241
-So you tell us,
what's the big thing here?
-All right, well,

06:48.375 --> 06:49.877
it's-it's actually
not inside the house.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.545
-It's outside the house.
It's back here.
-Oh.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.682
We spend most of our spring
and summers out here.

06:54.815 --> 06:55.983
This is where we eat.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.417
NISCHELLE:
Utkarsh, I'd never leave.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.819
You got a whole forest
back here.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.420
-UTKARSH: Yeah, so...
-There's a creek.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.255
I can't wait to see
what Utkarsh wants

07:02.389 --> 07:03.991
to add to this beautiful house.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.759
And this is the area
that I would really love

07:05.893 --> 07:07.661
-for you guys to help me with.
-Okay.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.597
This is sort of
what I'm trying to...

07:09.730 --> 07:11.765
NISCHELLE:
Okay.

07:11.899 --> 07:15.202
SABRINA:
Okay, now I get it.
There's junk everywhere,

07:15.335 --> 07:17.104
and the back deck is
literally falling apart.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.272
It looks haunted. I mean,
it looks like a horror movie

07:19.406 --> 07:21.241
could be shot back here now.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.276
-Utkarsh,
I got to ask you a question.
-Yeah.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.445
-So, on your CBS show Ghosts...
-Yeah, yeah.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.748
-...you guys do some renovation.
-Uh-huh.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.950
And, you know, we all know
what happens there.

07:30.082 --> 07:31.719
Is there anything
you want to tell us

07:31.852 --> 07:33.787
before we get started
renovating your parents' house?

07:33.921 --> 07:38.091
Well, despite the fact that the
deck looks haunted, it's not.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.093
There are no ghosts in here,

07:40.227 --> 07:42.429
-but there are some skeletons
in the closets.
-Ah!

07:42.563 --> 07:45.933
-Oh!
-All right, let's get to work.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.736
Easy. I haven't been up
these stairs in a long time.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.403
-Well...
-I'll tell you what.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.072
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-ROB: This is, uh...

07:52.205 --> 07:54.642
I don't even know if this is
still structurally sound.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.409
-SABRINA: Rob?
-Yeah.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.811
SABRINA:
Do we have time
to replace all of it?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.279
-It's gonna...
-It has to happen.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.081
This-this has to go, all of it.

08:01.214 --> 08:05.285
t's 25 years old, and it's madeI
f old pressure-treated lumber.o

08:05.418 --> 08:07.387
The whole thing really needs
to come down

08:07.487 --> 08:09.657
and be rebuilt
from the ground up.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.292
I mean, it literally is
falling apart right now.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.795
-Look at this.
-Sabrina, Sabrina, not...
-Whoa, whoa.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.797
-Let's wait
for the demo to start.
-Okay.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.332
-Okay, let's wait.
-I know. (roars)

08:19.466 --> 08:20.768
(Sabrina laughs)

08:20.901 --> 08:22.302
ROB:
Well, here's the thing, Sabrina.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.337
If we get rid of this bush
that's now a tree,

08:24.471 --> 08:27.507
I think we can open this up
and-and make a bigger area.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.176
-What do you think?
-Okay. I love that.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.444
-Just so I have an idea.
-Sure.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.681
About how many people
does this deck have to support?

08:33.813 --> 08:36.349
Well, uh, we are Indian, Rob.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.687
So I would say,
at any given time,

08:39.820 --> 08:41.520
-40 to 50.
-NISCHELLE: Oh.
-What?!

08:41.655 --> 08:43.323
So everybody's
just standing like this?

08:43.456 --> 08:45.659
-No. We need space out here.
-Well, we have, like...

08:45.793 --> 08:47.695
-Yeah, we need way more space
out here.
-Yeah.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.763
This is, like,
the centerpiece of the house

08:49.863 --> 08:51.765
-for social events
with the view.
-Okay.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.767
-And in summertime...
-Oh, so this has got to be,
like...

08:53.867 --> 08:55.435
-...the people mill about.
-...the-the Puff Daddy of all.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.104
-We'll build it,
and they will come.
-Yeah.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.539
The deck seems like
it would be the perfect place

08:59.673 --> 09:01.709
to hang out and lounge,
but right now

09:01.842 --> 09:04.144
it's not a place
you really want to stand on.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.879
I feel a little uneasy about it.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.715
-Exactly.
-Basically, people take turns.
You, like,

09:07.848 --> 09:09.850
get a ticket, and you go,
"You get 15 minutes on the deck.

09:09.983 --> 09:14.054
You get 15." The deck is
a time-share at this point.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.723
Utkarsh is talking

09:15.856 --> 09:18.191
about having 40 or 50 people
out here on this deck.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.994
So we're going to figure out
an entirely new design

09:21.128 --> 09:22.229
to make this space larger.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.964
UTKARSH:
That tree--

09:24.064 --> 09:26.033
-we're going to have
to work around it.
-Yes.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.500
-'Cause my parents planted that
themselves.
-This has to stay?

09:27.635 --> 09:29.202
There's, like, a picture of me

09:29.336 --> 09:30.904
t my junior prom with this treea
when it's probably just

09:31.038 --> 09:32.505
a little bit bigger than I am.-
-NISCHELLE: Okay.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.174
-Enough said. Enough said.
-ROB: Okay.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.043
SABRINA: The family's
favorite tree will stay,

09:36.176 --> 09:38.378
but everything else has to go.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.514
We'll rip it all down
and then build it back up

09:41.649 --> 09:44.685
with a new, bigger and
etter design for entertaining,b

09:44.818 --> 09:46.419
including a veranda,

09:46.553 --> 09:47.988
which will have comfortable
seating for nine,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.357
and a dining area
with new table,

09:50.490 --> 09:52.159
grill and beverage station.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.094
We're also going to increase
the space down below

09:54.227 --> 09:56.730
by relocating the stairs
to the other side of the deck,

09:56.864 --> 09:59.099
giving this new space
a more dramatic entrance

09:59.232 --> 10:00.533
and extra room.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.202
We'll build up the ground

10:02.335 --> 10:04.004
and add natural stone pavers
for the patio,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.006
as well
as some comfortable seating

10:06.106 --> 10:09.943
to turn this neglected area
into an oasis for the family.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.745
All right, you guys said
there was another area

10:11.879 --> 10:13.613
-that you might want to work on.
-There's an office, which...

10:13.747 --> 10:15.215
-An office?
-...to call it an office
at this point is just...

10:15.348 --> 10:16.884
it's-it's a joke.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.619
My mom uses the dining room
now instead of this,

10:19.753 --> 10:21.288
which is supposed
to be the office.

10:21.421 --> 10:25.258
My mom and my dad--
neither of them use it because

10:25.392 --> 10:26.794
it's not conducive
to actually doing work.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.628
NISCHELLE:
Yeah, it's not functional.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.264
-ROB: Office/exercise room.
-SABRINA: The office

10:31.398 --> 10:33.633
seems like it needs
a little love. It looks like

10:33.767 --> 10:35.635
things haven't been updated
in quite some time, so I want

10:35.769 --> 10:38.972
to really make it a space
that they want to do work in.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.808
I would love for this room
to have some purpose

10:40.941 --> 10:43.476
other than to just be,
like, a place to dump things.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.979
Got it. So, office and workout?

10:46.113 --> 10:48.448
Yeah, ideally.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.118
SABRINA:
This is a pretty small room,
so it's going to be tricky

10:51.251 --> 10:53.386
o get everything Utkarsh wantst
out of this space.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.322
NISCHELLE:
This is a small space,
but you do well

10:55.455 --> 10:57.090
-with small spaces. Yeah.
-SABRINA: I like a small space.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.491
It just looks like
there's no rhyme or reason.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.160
I want
to make it a functional space

11:00.293 --> 11:01.995
that looks absolutely beautiful.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.797
Organization, I think,
is key here

11:03.931 --> 11:05.999
-'cause there's a lot
of paperwork. Okay.
-Yes.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.168
-Well, I hate
to break up the party.
-No, you don't.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.304
-But we do actually have
to start to get to work.
-Okay.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.274
-Oh, that's my cue.
-(laughter)

11:14.407 --> 11:15.843
-Bye.
-That's my cue to go.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.610
No, really, I do have
some stuff to do because

11:17.745 --> 11:19.312
-I have some things planned
for you, as well.
-Oh.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.914
-Keep this man busy.
-Oh, we will.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.415
-We're going to keep him busy.
-Keep him busy.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.516
SABRINA:
The first thing we need to do

11:23.650 --> 11:25.352
is rip out that old carpet.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.354
Then we'll brighten it up
ith new paint and new lighting.w

11:27.487 --> 11:30.490
Then we'll install
vinyl flooring and top it off

11:30.623 --> 11:32.860
with an area rug,
new desk and chairs,

11:32.993 --> 11:34.995
storage cabinet,
and beautiful artwork.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.866
And finally, everything
they need to stay in shape.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.535
ROB:
We rarely do this type
of renovation or one this big,

11:42.669 --> 11:45.205
so we might have a problem
finishing up on time.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.540
But we're going to do everything
we can for Utkarsh's parents.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.343
-See ya.
-Because this is
your mom's stuff,

11:50.477 --> 11:52.179
-we have
to be very delicate...
-Right.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.781
-...when we're putting stuff
away.
-So, I'll start

11:53.881 --> 11:55.883
-with the heavy stuff.
-Okay.
-Oh, wow.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.684
-(chuckles)
-Let me help you with that.
Let me grab an end

11:57.818 --> 11:59.386
-to that and help you with that.
-It's gonna be a long day, guys.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.954
-Together.
-Okay. Easy.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.622
-I'll...
-Easy. Watch your back, Rob.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.858
-Sabrina, you do the rest.
-Sabrina, finish it up.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.659
SABRINA:
I love packing up a space

12:06.794 --> 12:08.528
because it's like
a little treasure hunt for me.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.364
-What is in here?
-If it's a newspaper,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.000
it's definitely from India.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.501
Oh, Richie Rich.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.837
who's into rocks and minerals?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.739
That would probably be me
in elementary school.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.241
Wow. Okay.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.010
You know what, guys?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.744
Maybe we should just sit here
and read books all day.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.014
-No? Okay.
-And here we go.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.648
Once we had everything
cleared out,

12:28.748 --> 12:31.584
the only demo that was left
to do was to take up

12:31.718 --> 12:33.086
the old carpet.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.188
Do you have a license
to operate one of these?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.557
(whoops) I do now.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.559
-ROB: Start right at the end.
-UTKARSH: Uh-huh.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.161
And then you put it in.
Just cut right through.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.430
You pull it down.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.099
SABRINA:
I'll get in front of you
and start rolling.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.435
UTKARSH:
This is so satisfying.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.270
SABRINA:
Ah! (laughs)

12:50.403 --> 12:51.604
ROB:
There you go.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.906
UTKARSH:
Wow.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.408
Are you guys getting this
at home?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.177
-(Sabrina laughs)
-Are you seeing this?

12:57.277 --> 13:00.413
You pick it up like this.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.516
The key is to act like it's way
heavier than it actually is.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.952
SABRINA:
Yeah, it's, uh...

13:05.085 --> 13:06.453
It weighs two pounds.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.622
To give the illusion
that I'm working hard.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.458
-We got another one?
-ROB: There you go.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.460
-Don't hurt the baseboard.
-SABRINA: No. Look at...

13:13.593 --> 13:15.562
There's one every,
like, two inches.

13:15.695 --> 13:16.629
UTKARSH:
Guys, don't fight. I'm...

13:16.763 --> 13:18.798
Wait. How does this even work?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.733
ROB:
You know, what's good is that

13:20.868 --> 13:23.136
your sweater
actually matches the tool.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.238
I'm, like, the only dude
who's ever done this

13:25.372 --> 13:26.907
-wearing a cashmere sweater.
-Cashmere.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.808
I mean, you are very fancy.

13:28.942 --> 13:32.479
Utkarsh did a pretty good job
with the pry bar in the office.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.314
So, even though
my guys are coming tomorrow,

13:34.447 --> 13:36.649
e're going to get a jump startw
on demoing the deck.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.085
ROB:
Have you ever used sawzall?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.420
-Nope, but let's do it.
-Okay.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.322
-Right.
-So you want to hold it level.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.325
(buzzing)

13:47.094 --> 13:48.828
You got it. You got it.
Let's go to the next one.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.331
(laughter)

13:51.464 --> 13:53.400
Uh-oh. We created a monster.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.069
-This is amazing.
-Go ahead.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.912
ROB:
Okay.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.679
-On the count of three,
we're gonna push it over.
-Okay.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.681
-One, two, three.
-SABRINA: Two, three.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.321
-I'm blind!
NISCHELLE: Utkarsh gets to work-

14:14.454 --> 14:15.822
in the office...

14:15.956 --> 14:17.024
I forgot to tell you
about the sheetrock dust.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.358
No, it's all good.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.859
...and makes more space...

14:19.993 --> 14:21.294
Watch this, everyone.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.662
...for the deck outside.

14:22.795 --> 14:23.997
ROB:
Can we have a moment of silence

14:24.131 --> 14:25.365
for the tree that gave its life?

14:25.498 --> 14:28.168
Dear tree, forgive Sabrina.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.536
What?!

14:29.669 --> 14:31.038
For her idea to chop you down.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.705
NISCHELLE:
And later...

14:32.839 --> 14:33.806
MAN (over P.A.):
Utkarsh Ambudkar, please come

14:33.941 --> 14:34.975
to the principal's office

14:35.108 --> 14:36.376
immediately. I repeat...

14:36.509 --> 14:37.544
NISCHELLE:
I take Utkarsh back

14:37.677 --> 14:39.046
to where it all began...

14:39.179 --> 14:40.380
UTKARSH:
Every minute that I spent

14:40.513 --> 14:42.182
in that theater was

14:42.315 --> 14:44.217
pure, unadulterated joy.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.519
NISCHELLE:
..with a few special surprises.
along the way.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.855
-Hi. No way!
-Do you see who that is?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.157
Harriett Mittelberger, man.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.225
UTKARSH:
How did you do that?

14:52.359 --> 14:53.360
You changed the course
of my life.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.902
NISCHELLE:
Utkarsh Ambudkar.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.404
I don't want to embarrass you.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.738
NISCHELLE:
Actor...

15:05.872 --> 15:07.640
No, it's more like
you save yourself

15:07.740 --> 15:09.242
from humiliation.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.244
...and rapper...

15:11.378 --> 15:12.379
-* I need a volunteer... *
-...currently starring

15:12.512 --> 15:14.581
n the hit CBS sitcom Ghosts... i

15:14.714 --> 15:16.083
-Okay, this is huge.
-And it's all ours.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.517
...about a husband and wife

15:17.650 --> 15:19.852
renovating
their new haunted house,

15:19.987 --> 15:22.722
has returned home
to surprise his parents

15:22.855 --> 15:23.923
with a real-life renovation.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.858
Oh, she was waiting for you.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.760
To thank them
for their unending support,

15:27.894 --> 15:32.599
tkarsh is remodeling an officeU
badly in need of attention...

15:32.732 --> 15:35.102
-I'll tell you what.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:35.235 --> 15:36.869
...and renovating
the family's deck,

15:37.004 --> 15:39.272
which is on its last legs.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.274
-(laughter)
-ROB: Uh-oh.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.110
-On the count of three,
we're going to push it over.
-Okay.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.278
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

15:46.846 --> 15:47.880
ROB:
There we go.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.417
Today I got my guys coming in

15:50.550 --> 15:52.085
to fully demo the old deck.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.787
But first
we got to clear out some space.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.124
We're keeping the tree
that the family planted,

15:57.257 --> 15:59.192
but on the other side
of the deck,

15:59.292 --> 16:01.128
there's an overgrown bush
that's grown so big,

16:01.261 --> 16:02.129
it looks like a tree.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.730
And that's got to go.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.465
Do you remember how
to do the sawzall?

16:05.598 --> 16:07.534
-I remember how
to do the sawzall.
-Oh!

16:07.634 --> 16:09.269
-Here we go. Ready?
-SABRINA: I got one down.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.903
-Start low.
-Good job.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.873
-Cut it as low as you can.
-Watch this, everyone.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.314
SABRINA:
Oh, boy, is he...

16:21.448 --> 16:23.283
Limbs-- they look
like they could be light,

16:23.416 --> 16:24.651
but they're actually
super heavy,

16:24.784 --> 16:26.319
so I was a little worried
about my noggin.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.127
ROB:
Can we have a moment of silence

16:34.261 --> 16:37.330
for the tree that gave its life
for your parents' new deck?

16:37.464 --> 16:41.101
Dear trees, forgive Sabrina
for her idea to chop you down.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.769
Nice try.

16:42.902 --> 16:46.005
Sabrina really wanted that tree
to come down,

16:46.139 --> 16:48.007
and Rob and I--
we fought against it.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.976
Let it be known,
I didn't want this to happen.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.512
-I know you didn't.
-Rob and I tried to stop her,
trees.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.148
In the end, she won, and I hope
she's proud of herself.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.849
I can't be part of this anymore.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.318
Well, that's okay. We're going
to drag this out front

16:58.451 --> 17:00.153
-to get rid of this.
-Yeah, we got this.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.621
ROB:
With the bush gone,
my guys could

17:01.754 --> 17:03.323
get in there
and do their thing.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.525
Look, ripping out
any deck is a lot of work.

17:05.657 --> 17:08.861
This one here is almost
en feet high in some sections,t

17:08.994 --> 17:11.698
so we need to do
it strategically and safely

17:11.830 --> 17:13.665
so that no one gets hurt.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.934
While my guys get it
all in the dumpster,

17:15.034 --> 17:16.203
I got a little project

17:16.336 --> 17:18.371
n the office for Utkarsh to do.i

17:18.505 --> 17:20.140
All right,
so what we have to do is...

17:20.272 --> 17:22.008
This is where your mom
and dad's new light is gonna go

17:22.142 --> 17:23.376
-in the office.
-Great.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.944
I've already marked it.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.378
We have to cut a hole
for the junction box.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.147
UTKARSH:
There is an office

17:28.281 --> 17:29.882
that my parents don't use
because it's super dark.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.351
And so,
they use our dining room,

17:31.484 --> 17:32.985
which just isn't going to fly.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.354
So more light in the office
is absolutely paramount.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.855
We need it.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.891
I'm sure
you've had to overexplain this

17:39.025 --> 17:40.560
to many people like me,

17:40.693 --> 17:42.562
but can you tell me
what a junction box is?

17:42.695 --> 17:45.332
Yeah. Simply, there's no wire
in the ceiling right there

17:45.465 --> 17:47.734
-where we're going
to attach our light fixture to.
-Okay.

17:47.867 --> 17:52.172
So a junction box will be
fixed up in between the studs,

17:52.305 --> 17:53.540
and we'll run a wire to it,

17:53.673 --> 17:54.674
and it'll give us a place

17:54.807 --> 17:55.808
to mount the light fixture.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.213
-Keep going?
-Hold it straight.
Right through.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.914
That's it. Bring it down.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.152
-I'm blind!
-Perfect.
And that worked out good,

18:05.252 --> 18:08.721
'cause there's no stud there, so
we'll put a spreader in between.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.723
The junction box?
First of all,

18:10.857 --> 18:13.593
thought it was something
that goes on a train.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.262
Doesn't. Goes in your ceiling.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.096
And now I know how
to cut a hole for one.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.666
Forgot to tell you
about the sheetrock dust.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.334
-No, it's all good.
-But that's why

18:21.434 --> 18:23.503
-I had you do it and not me.
-Yup, I see that now.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.440
You're blinded by what
I can only hope is not asbestos.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.910
Um, and then you kind of,
like, dust yourself off, and

18:31.043 --> 18:32.279
it was really fun.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.846
The next thing
we got to do is just

18:33.946 --> 18:35.515
put the junction box in,
and then we'll be ready

18:35.615 --> 18:38.285
for paint, and, uh,
this room will be ready to go.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.553
Everything has been running
pretty smoothly

18:40.687 --> 18:42.789
so far in this renovation.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.757
In the office,
the flooring went in,

18:44.891 --> 18:48.295
and outside we finally have
a clean slate to work with.

18:48.428 --> 18:52.232
All the lumber's here, and
I have all my carpenters in.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.801
So we're going to get this
entire deck framed out today.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.969
When we're done,
Utkarsh's parents

18:57.103 --> 18:59.872
are going to have
way more space out here.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.142
And unlike the old deck,
which was about to fall down,

19:03.276 --> 19:06.379
this one's going to be safe
and last a lifetime.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.649
And in order for Utkarsh's mom
and dad to access

19:09.782 --> 19:11.818
the beautiful new deck,
we're replacing the old,

19:11.951 --> 19:14.821
haunted staircase
with a new sturdy one,

19:14.954 --> 19:18.325
which will lead out
to the new patio.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.328
This is all pretty heavy
construction, and Nischelle

19:21.461 --> 19:22.895
wanted to take Utkarsh

19:22.995 --> 19:24.664
back to his high school
where it all began.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.133
So I told her today was
a perfect day for that.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.337
NISCHELLE:
ow, you moved to this-this areaN

19:30.470 --> 19:31.671
when you were, what, 13?

19:31.804 --> 19:33.005
I just turned 13,

19:33.139 --> 19:34.774
and we moved
to this neighborhood.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.343
What were you into?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.511
I was really hoping
to play basketball.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.280
And my friend Camby--

19:40.413 --> 19:42.982
e and I went to see this play,h
and I was like,

19:43.115 --> 19:44.984
"I think I could do this."

19:45.117 --> 19:48.288
My mom had Camby sign me up
for auditions for

19:48.421 --> 19:49.689
-Taming of the Shrew.
-Uh-huh.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.824
And I got onstage,
and it was like

19:51.958 --> 19:54.661
-dropping a fish in water.
It was really wild.
-Oh, wow.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.530
UTKARSH:
Okay, so this is
Wootton High School.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.367
-NISCHELLE:
I'm hyped about this.
-Welcome to my alma mater.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.502
Wow. Office was here, I think.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.771
Yeah.
Guidance counselor was here.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.606
-Yeah?
-Ms. Goddard was there.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.108
Peek in. Oh, yeah.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.543
-That's it, huh?
-(bell dings)

20:10.677 --> 20:12.379
MAN (over P.A.):
Utkarsh Ambudkar,

20:12.512 --> 20:14.381
please come to the principal's
office immediately.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.383
I repeat. Utkarsh Ambudkar,

20:16.516 --> 20:17.817
-please come
to the principal's office.
-(laughing)

20:17.950 --> 20:19.185
-Oh, crazy.
-Does that sound familiar?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.487
Who did that?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.221
-I know that voice.
-All right.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.291
There he is. That's very funny.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.693
ick Hitchens was one of my veryN
best friends in high school.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.561
An incredible singer, actor.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.731
This dude, he and I did
plays together in high school.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.733
Anthropological...

20:33.866 --> 20:35.735
We sang together,
acted together.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.904
And now,
20-some-odd years later,

20:38.037 --> 20:39.672
he's the assistant principal

20:39.806 --> 20:41.408
-at the same high school
that we went to.
-Are you serious?

20:41.541 --> 20:42.475
Who was the better singer?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.876
-Nick, by far.
-(laughs)

20:44.010 --> 20:45.745
He has a great voice.
It got butter...

20:45.878 --> 20:47.580
Hey, man, that means a lot.
I appreciate it.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.583
Well, 'cause when I graduated...
Hi.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.918
-You see who that is?
-No way.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.252
Harriett Mittelberger, man.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.754
How did you do that?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.556
-How are you?
-I'm good.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.091
-Oh, wow.
-It's so good to see you.

20:59.225 --> 21:01.260
-These are my guys.
-Yeah.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.396
Hey, Ms. Mitt...

21:03.530 --> 21:05.932
UTKARSH: Nick and I had this
irector, Harriett Mittelberger,d

21:06.065 --> 21:09.068
and when I wanted to become
an actor, my mom was like,

21:09.201 --> 21:12.339
"I need a second opinion,"
and called Harriett.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.608
It's really 'cause you told my
mom to give me a chance, truly.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.610
-Wow.
-I think if you had said,
"No, he doesn't have it,"

21:17.744 --> 21:19.346
it just wouldn't
have happened for me.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.680
-No, you did have the talent.
-So thank you so much.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.515
Based on
whatever Harriett told her,

21:22.615 --> 21:25.585
my mom agreed to let me
pursue acting as a career.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.921
So she literally is,
like, she's the only reason.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.623
-Can we go see the theater?
-Sure, of course.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.091
-NISCHELLE: Yeah.
-UTKARSH: It's so exciting

21:32.224 --> 21:33.593
to be here.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.927
So there we go.
Yeah, Anything Goes.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.963
Harriett Mittelberger.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.732
UTKARSH: Because there's
such great memories.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.134
-Here are the shows. Everybody
gets to write their names.
-Oh, cool!

21:42.268 --> 21:44.937
UTKARSH: Every minute
that I spent in that theater

21:45.071 --> 21:47.474
was pure, unadulterated joy.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.476
It's really cool.

21:49.609 --> 21:53.079
I mean, when you look at this
stage, everything that I've done

21:53.212 --> 21:56.449
since was just to get back to
the way it felt doing it here.

21:56.583 --> 21:57.950
You changed
the course of my life.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.452
(chuckles)

21:59.586 --> 22:01.954
-Come on, Utkarsh...
-It's like completely...

22:02.088 --> 22:04.991
My mom put the responsibility
of my future

22:05.124 --> 22:06.893
-in your hands,
and you didn't mess it up.
-I didn't know that.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.728
I didn't know that.
I didn't mess it up.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.096
-Good job.
-I'm so glad I didn't mess up.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.665
I just tear up.
I'm so proud of him.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.801
And I'm so honored

22:14.934 --> 22:17.470
that he, that you feel that way,
I'm so honored.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.171
-Really. It's, it's so true.
-Um...

22:19.305 --> 22:22.008
sorry.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.644
NISCHELLE: Coming up, Rob
becomes a little designer...

22:24.777 --> 22:27.346
I was thinking
that we could incorporate

22:27.480 --> 22:29.248
some of the old deck,

22:29.348 --> 22:31.851
since it meant so much to them,
into the new bench.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.687
..and leaves the heavy lifting.
for Sabrina.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.823
All right, I'll be right back.
Just hold that

22:36.956 --> 22:38.024
for a minute, okay?

22:38.157 --> 22:39.692
-I got to go work out.
-(laughs)

22:39.826 --> 22:40.860
Come on.

22:40.993 --> 22:41.961
And later...

22:42.094 --> 22:44.864
ALL:
One, two, three.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.332
-Open!
-Wow!

22:46.466 --> 22:47.667
Oh, my God!

22:47.800 --> 22:50.002
Wow!

22:54.006 --> 22:56.375
NISCHELLE: When Utkarsh
Ambudkar's parents immigrated

22:56.509 --> 23:00.046
to America in 1980,
hey had no idea what to expect.t

23:00.179 --> 23:02.849
And it was also foreign
to this pair of biochemists

23:02.982 --> 23:05.217
when their only son
fell in love with the stage.

23:05.351 --> 23:08.455
But nevertheless,
hey worked tirelessly for yearst

23:08.555 --> 23:11.724
to foster his dream
of Hollywood stardom.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.894
So to say thanks
for everything they've done,

23:15.027 --> 23:17.697
Utkarsh is building them
a new deck and renovating

23:17.830 --> 23:19.732
their home office
so they can entertain

23:19.866 --> 23:22.502
their friends and family
and work from home in style.

23:23.503 --> 23:27.740
It's day seven, and the team
has made good headway so far.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.375
he office was freshly painted.T

23:29.509 --> 23:31.077
And the floor molding
was finished off.

23:31.210 --> 23:34.146
And outside,
the new deck is really

23:34.246 --> 23:36.082
coming to life with all
the new composite floorboards

23:36.215 --> 23:38.551
and handrailings going in.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.389
This is a huge deck
we're building.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.760
All right, guys, looking good.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.262
And we've undertaken
a lot with this renovation.

23:50.396 --> 23:53.900
One section at a time.
Be careful, all right?

23:54.033 --> 23:55.535
But I got faith in my team.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.104
We're gonna get it done,
and it's gonna look amazing.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.375
Rob, hold on.
Can you give me a second?

24:03.510 --> 24:05.111
I'll tell you what,
when I come back

24:05.244 --> 24:07.947
-in my next life,
I want to be a designer.
-Why?

24:08.080 --> 24:09.949
-What are you doing
sitting down?
-Are you kidding me right now?

24:10.082 --> 24:11.618
I'll be right there, Joe.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.520
So I've been looking
at all the furniture options.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.854
And there's
so much to choose from.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.689
I want to make sure
that you and I

24:16.789 --> 24:18.290
choose the same one.
It's more of a test

24:18.424 --> 24:19.526
-than anything.
-You're testing me?

24:19.626 --> 24:20.960
-Yeah.
-On my design ability.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.195
-That's right.
-But you're the designer.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.864
-That's right.
-Okay. Okay.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.465
-So this is option one.
-Yeah.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.801
-Kinda like that
hanging chair situation.
-Right.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.870
-We have this option.
-Okay.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.472
More of a lounge, traditional.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.441
And then this
is more modern coastal.

24:35.575 --> 24:38.645
-I feel like I got to go
with "A."
-Okay, good.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.246
-So we are on the same page.
-Was I right?

24:40.379 --> 24:41.648
-Yes, you're right.
-Really?

24:41.781 --> 24:42.982
Yes.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.416
You could be a designer.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.485
-Oh, my gosh!
-Watch out.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.154
Are you for real?

24:48.287 --> 24:49.989
You know,
helping out Sabrina did

24:50.122 --> 24:51.457
make me feel a little bit

24:51.591 --> 24:53.092
like a designer,

24:53.225 --> 24:54.627
and I already came up
with a great idea.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.663
Hey, Joe,
come here for a second.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.464
-All right.
-This is what I'm thinking.
So we're gonna build

24:58.598 --> 25:00.432
-some new benches
on the deck for them.
-All right.

25:00.567 --> 25:03.169
But I was thinking
maybe we take

25:03.302 --> 25:05.071
a piece of the old deck

25:05.171 --> 25:07.506
-and incorporate it
into the new bench.
-All right.

25:07.640 --> 25:11.911
Indu and Suresh spent almost
30 years with that old deck.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.914
It would be nice to preserve
even just a piece of it.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.515
-But what do you think?
-Yeah, it's a nice idea.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.150
It's just, uh...

25:18.284 --> 25:19.418
it's, like, probably
the ugliest piece of wood

25:19.518 --> 25:20.853
I've ever seen in my life.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.254
We'll rip it and sand it.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.856
-It'll look great.
-All right.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.158
ROB:
So my plan is to split up

25:26.292 --> 25:28.194
the work on this side project.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.496
I put Joe
on the task of building

25:30.630 --> 25:32.665
the new bench for the deck.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.770
While I started to clean
and prepare the wood

25:37.870 --> 25:40.372
that I had taken
out of the dumpster.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.644
I can't wait to show
Sabrina what I came up with.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.547
Hey, Sabrina.
Who's the designer now?

25:49.782 --> 25:51.684
So, this is the bench
that I built for the deck.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.887
-Okay. I like it a lot.
-And...

25:55.021 --> 25:56.522
We sanded it, but I left, like,

25:56.656 --> 25:58.324
see the old nails
from the old deck?

25:58.457 --> 26:00.492
And we grinded it on this side.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.662
So I was thinking we'd put it
in the front like this.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.896
-I love that.
-Yeah?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.564
You know what? When I am on

26:05.698 --> 26:07.166
my hiking trail,
there's always these benches

26:07.299 --> 26:08.701
that are dedicated to people.

26:08.835 --> 26:11.370
What if we, like, somehow
dedicate this to them?

26:11.503 --> 26:13.305
Yeah, we could do that.
We could get a plaque made

26:13.405 --> 26:16.242
-and kind of center it
right in the middle.
-Yeah.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.409
-Would that be all right?
-Oh, I love this.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.045
Listen, Sabrina and I don't see

26:19.178 --> 26:20.647
eye to eye all that often,

26:20.747 --> 26:22.815
but I got to admit, when we do,

26:22.915 --> 26:24.216
we make a pretty good team.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.085
Working together, I love it.
Thank you.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.353
Oh, you were supposed to,
at the end,

26:27.486 --> 26:28.921
like, do you, like, blow it up?

26:29.055 --> 26:30.422
-(imitates explosion)
-There you go.

26:30.556 --> 26:31.924
All right,
I'm gonna go back downstairs.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.826
Welcome back to 2012.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.995
(Sabrina laughing)

26:36.095 --> 26:39.098
ROB:
For some reason, on this build
there just doesn't seem

26:39.231 --> 26:41.768
to be enough hours in the day.
It's been raining a ton,

26:41.901 --> 26:44.070
and we only have
a few days left,

26:44.203 --> 26:45.171
so we have
to keep plugging away.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.739
Today we laid the concrete

26:46.873 --> 26:48.941
to set our new deck footings
in place.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.778
We installed
a new sliding glass door,

26:51.911 --> 26:54.213
which will lead out
to the new back patio,

26:54.346 --> 26:57.449
where we also had
to add some more dirt

26:57.583 --> 26:59.952
and get the whole area prepped
for the natural

27:00.086 --> 27:01.954
tone pavers we have coming in.s

27:02.088 --> 27:04.290
Up top, I have my carpenters

27:04.423 --> 27:06.793
framing out the roof
for the veranda,

27:06.926 --> 27:08.795
And when this is done,

27:08.928 --> 27:10.797
they'll even be able
to sit out here in the rain,

27:10.930 --> 27:14.300
which I think Indu and Suresh
are absolutely gonna love.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.805
SABRINA:
With the roof in place,
now we can transform this

27:18.938 --> 27:21.941
into the veranda that Utkarsh
really wanted for his parents.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.276
To get the feel I want,
I went with

27:24.410 --> 27:26.078
a natural tongue and groove
beadboard

27:26.212 --> 27:28.547
for the ceiling,
ut this ceiling is really high,b

27:28.647 --> 27:31.650
so it's taking a ton
of Rob's guys to put it up.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.053
It's amazing
how quick they nail it in

27:34.153 --> 27:36.288
and then
give it a light sanding.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.657
After Rob finished covering up
all the support beams...

27:38.791 --> 27:41.227
(whoops)
Looks good.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.663
We need to finalize
the electrical in the office.

27:44.797 --> 27:45.898
-It's really heavy.
-Two hands.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.266
-No, but it's heavy.
-I know.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.567
-I'm just warning you.
-I know it is.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.169
We got two
different height options.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.638
Okay? This one here
is a foot down

27:52.772 --> 27:54.673
or...

27:54.807 --> 27:57.509
-tight to the ceiling.
-I think because...

27:57.643 --> 27:59.478
this is a smaller space

27:59.611 --> 28:01.180
and that's
a really big light fixture,

28:01.313 --> 28:03.449
I feel like it
should be semi-flush mount

28:03.582 --> 28:05.017
instead of, like,
more encroaching the space.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.152
Okay.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.955
Like a little hat.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.859
Look at-- you look like a...
like a lamp. Like cha-ching.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.961
Look at how
bright and shiny she is,

28:15.094 --> 28:16.328
-ladies and gentlemen.
-Right?

28:16.462 --> 28:18.164
All right.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.198
Wait, I'm just holding it
for you.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.967
-It's fine.
-Okay.

28:21.100 --> 28:24.436
I actually work out, Rob,
unlike some people on this job.

28:24.536 --> 28:28.307
I'm not naming any names,
but it rhymes with Bob.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.876
(laughs)

28:30.009 --> 28:31.210
All right, I'll be right back.

28:31.343 --> 28:32.211
Just hold that for a minute,
okay?

28:32.344 --> 28:33.212
I got to go work out.

28:33.345 --> 28:37.683
(laughs)
Come on.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.119
After I finish my arm workout,
Rob has to finish the light,

28:40.219 --> 28:42.021
and I want to pick out
some photos to highlight.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.389
And I know
just the place to look.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.225
I am so glad that we
found this book

28:46.358 --> 28:47.693
-of your parents'...
-We did.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.829
-We did.
Of your parents' wedding.
-Yeah.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.231
Because what I want to do
is frame a few photos.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.232
Right.

28:53.365 --> 28:56.068
-March 23, 1979.
-1979.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.073
SABRINA:
This is so amazing.
They look so young.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.242
How old were they when
they came to this country?

29:03.375 --> 29:05.177
UTKARSH:
In the mid to late 20s.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.913
SABRINA:
Like, growing up,
how did you kind of

29:07.046 --> 29:08.580
find the culture yourself?

29:08.714 --> 29:10.549
Well, we lived in a cul-de-sac,

29:10.682 --> 29:12.751
and my neighbor
George Samuels taught me

29:12.885 --> 29:16.022
how to play baseball,
taught me about Cal Ripken Jr.

29:16.155 --> 29:20.259
And my first Bullets game
was with him and his son Robbie,

29:20.392 --> 29:22.094
who was my best friend
growing up.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.596
We celebrated Yom Kippur
and Rosh Hashanah.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.566
-And we did-- they taught me
about Hanukkah and...
-I love that.

29:27.699 --> 29:31.003
On the flip side, Robbie
would come over and eat samosas

29:31.103 --> 29:34.440
and learn about Indian culture
and celebrate Diwali and Holi.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.242
And it was, um...

29:36.375 --> 29:38.344
I mean, I know this sounds,
like, hokey, but isn't that

29:38.444 --> 29:40.379
what this country is about?
Right?

29:40.512 --> 29:42.281
Yeah, yeah, it was really cool.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.083
SABRINA:
I'm first generation American.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.018
Both my parents
immigrated here from Cuba,

29:46.118 --> 29:49.388
so I can totally
understand this family's story.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.291
-I love it, so...
-And you can pick
any one of these.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.793
I think my family
would be over the moon.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.562
If my parents can take
that walk down memory lane

29:56.695 --> 29:57.563
and look
at their wedding photos,

29:57.696 --> 29:59.065
I think it'll be great.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.799
You know, they've been married
for so long,

30:00.933 --> 30:04.803
nd it's, it's nice to see thema
young and wide-eyed

30:04.937 --> 30:07.639
and without any idea
of what-what's to come.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.475
Okay, I'll take care of it.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.913
NISCHELLE: With the reno
moving along, so are we.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.315
Utkarsh is a great actor,
but he started out

30:16.448 --> 30:17.984
as a rapper,
and that's how he got

30:18.117 --> 30:19.585
the role in the movie
Pitch Perfect.

30:19.718 --> 30:22.454
So I wanted
to see where it all began

30:22.588 --> 30:24.323
at his old friend Zia's house.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.893
I haven't been here
in at least 11 years.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.895
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. It's been a long time.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.129
Oh, my gosh.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.731
(laughing)

30:32.831 --> 30:34.566
-Hey, man.
-Hey, Utkarsh.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.168
-How's it going?
-Good.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.803
-Good to see ya.
-Aw, reunion time.

30:37.937 --> 30:38.971
Oh, my gosh.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.576
-Wow.
-So this is
where y'all hung out.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.179
This was, like,
the center of our world.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.115
It's so cool to be back there
and be like, oh, yeah,

30:49.248 --> 30:50.917
this is where it happened.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.351
-This corner is
the first place...
-NISCHELLE: Okay.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.954
...that I ever
recorded music in my life.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.523
He's always had that ability
to just sort of

30:57.656 --> 31:00.526
make things up on the spot,
let his brain flow,

31:00.659 --> 31:03.195
and not really judge
what's coming out, you know?

31:03.329 --> 31:06.032
* Sitting here cross-legged
with Miss Nischelle *

31:06.165 --> 31:08.000
* Yeah, she's
the host of the show *

31:08.134 --> 31:10.802
* You all know
I'm UTK with the flow *

31:10.937 --> 31:12.804
* Okay, yes,
so yes, get respect *

31:12.939 --> 31:16.042
* I'm here on CBS getting
my folks a brand-new deck *

31:16.175 --> 31:17.709
-Ha!
-* And an office, too *

31:17.843 --> 31:19.878
* That's how I'm
here rocking with you *

31:20.012 --> 31:22.381
* But anyway, we do it all day *

31:22.514 --> 31:24.550
* Zia and UTK, oh, yeah. *

31:24.683 --> 31:27.853
Oh, yeah!

31:27.987 --> 31:29.721
Give me a little bit up top.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.857
See what I'm saying? Didn't it
tug your heartstrings?

31:31.991 --> 31:33.559
-He said your name in there.
-Yes. Yeah.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.628
I did. That's why they pay us
dozens of dollars.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.066
-Dozens of dollars.
-Dozens of dollars.
-Yeah.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.468
This really just--
I'm not even kidding you.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.003
-This makes me so happy.
-UTKARSH: Me, too. Me, too.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.404
This makes my heart feel good.

31:45.537 --> 31:46.905
-It's really, really special.
-Yeah.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.474
-I love you, man.
-I love you, too.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.841
-It's really good to see you.
-Good to see you.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.343
All right.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.246
NISCHELLE:
he team is running out of time,T

31:54.380 --> 31:57.249
and they're not sure if
verything's gonna get finishede

31:57.383 --> 32:00.086
before Utkarsh's parents
get back home.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.197
NISCHELLE:
Utkarsh wants to give his
parents a dream renovation,

32:11.330 --> 32:15.501
ut with only one day left untilb
Indu and Suresh return home,

32:15.601 --> 32:18.404
the team may have bit off
more than they can chew.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.239
Even though the office
is ready to go,

32:20.372 --> 32:23.575
there is still major
construction going on outside.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.111
The roof shingles are
going down,

32:25.244 --> 32:26.945
and the gutters are going up.

32:27.079 --> 32:31.083
Rob has multiple teams working
side by side installing

32:31.217 --> 32:33.919
all the electric,
dding the last of the railings,a

32:34.053 --> 32:35.754
and polishing everything off
with new lattice

32:35.887 --> 32:37.889
underneath the deck,

32:38.024 --> 32:39.625
and a fresh coat of paint
on top.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.427
There is definitely
a lot going on,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.462
and Utkarsh is helping out
wherever he can.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.565
Okay, so remember how we
talked about, you know,

32:46.698 --> 32:48.467
-building a patio
for Mom and Dad?
-Right, right.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.302
Well, Sabrina came up with
this cool idea

32:50.436 --> 32:52.971
to add a fire pit.

32:53.105 --> 32:56.575
We've got over 1,500 pounds
of natural stone pavers

32:56.708 --> 32:58.977
going in today, and as we're
carrying them in,

32:59.111 --> 33:01.647
my guys are immediately
cutting them to size

33:01.780 --> 33:03.649
and putting them in place.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.984
You know, this whole area
wasn't used before,

33:06.118 --> 33:08.654
but with all this beautiful
new stonework

33:08.787 --> 33:10.222
and the fire pit going in,

33:10.322 --> 33:12.291
Utkarsh's parents
are going to have

33:12.424 --> 33:15.661
a whole new area to entertain
their family and friends.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.496
I think the fire pit
came out nice.

33:17.629 --> 33:18.930
That patio's looking good.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.966
And just to, like,
have these little chairs

33:21.100 --> 33:25.003
and, like, relaxing
up against this view...

33:25.137 --> 33:26.972
-ROB: Beautiful. Yeah, it is.
-It's gonna be amazing.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.478
SABRINA:
Today is Reveal Day,
and I can't wait

33:32.611 --> 33:34.946
for Utkarsh's parents to see
what we've done here.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.515
I am so excited.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.016
-There are the pictures!
-Wow.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.685
SABRINA:
Ta-da!

33:39.818 --> 33:41.653
And then check this out.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.122
Oh, my gosh, is this therapy?

33:43.255 --> 33:44.256
Yes, it is.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.024
Trust me, you don't want
to know.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.959
-All right, fair enough.
-(laughs)

33:48.094 --> 33:49.495
UTKARSH: Look how much light
is in here now.

33:49.628 --> 33:50.796
SABRINA: Right?
o you remember how dark it was?D

33:50.929 --> 33:52.764
UTKARSH:
It's just gorgeous.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.600
They're gonna be so surprised
with this room.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.168
SABRINA: All right, let's
inish off the rest of the housef

33:56.302 --> 33:57.803
-so we can actually see this.
-Okay, cool.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.971
The stuff Sabrina has done
in the office,

34:00.106 --> 34:02.541
they're just--
They're gonna be really touched.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.311
-You want to put that
in the corner there?
-Yep.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.478
Utkarsh, I want you
to try it out.

34:06.612 --> 34:07.879
Try it out.
Go ahead, bro.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.848
-SABRINA: What do you think?
-Well,

34:09.981 --> 34:12.050
I will sit here,
and you guys can continue.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.219
Oh, gosh, yeah, he's done.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.155
All right, Utkarsh.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.989
Let's do this so that one person
can be in shade.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.559
And s'mores.

34:20.692 --> 34:21.893
Is there, like, a trick
to make a fire?

34:22.027 --> 34:23.829
ROB:
You want to put it in a tepee.

34:23.962 --> 34:25.996
You know, I love backyard fires,

34:26.132 --> 34:27.899
especially when I can
use a lighter

34:28.033 --> 34:29.534
instead of a flint
and a machete,

34:29.668 --> 34:30.902
like when I was on Survivor.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.571
Saves a lot of time.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.739
-Can you feel that?
-I feel the warmth.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.308
-Okay, we still have work
to do, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.009
-Let's go upstairs.
-Right.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.878
They built a tree house
and a whole brand-new room.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.746
The way that they executed it
was just incredible.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.217
-This way, please.
Bend with the knees.
-(laughter)

34:45.351 --> 34:47.085
SABRINA:
Do we remember what this deck
looked like before?

34:47.219 --> 34:49.221
NISCHELLE:
Yeah, it was the haunted deck.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.422
So above and beyond anything
that I could have imagined, bro.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.025
-You good? Aw.
-It's incredible.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.395
UTKARSH: Did you know that
the railings are composite?

34:56.527 --> 34:58.897
-You taught him that, right?
-I give him an "A"
for paying attention.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.700
They'll be here
for hundreds of years.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.602
Okay, let's keep going
because they're almost here.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.737
-This is heavy.
-That does look heavy.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.173
Nischelle,
you gotta check this out.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.607
We used a little bit
of the old deck...

35:08.740 --> 35:09.575
-Oh, you did?
-...and we incorporated it

35:09.708 --> 35:10.942
into the new bench.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.579
-Let me see. This is awesome.
-Yeah.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.447
It's a pellet smoker.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.082
It's like, set it and forget it.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.618
So cool, man. My dad is
gonna be over the moon.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.887
NISCHELLE:
Let's go meet Mom and Daddy.

35:23.021 --> 35:25.257
*

35:25.391 --> 35:28.093
UTKARSH:
I think they're gonna love all
the work that we've done here.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.428
So are you excited?

35:29.561 --> 35:30.562
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

35:30.696 --> 35:32.798
A bit anxious to see what's

35:32.931 --> 35:34.466
-been done, right?
-Yeah.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.269
I'm not anxious, I'm just,
like, excited, I think.

35:37.403 --> 35:38.970
-And eager.
-Yeah.

35:39.104 --> 35:41.139
Indu and Suresh are almost here.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.874
I can't wait to
finally meet them.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.111
INDU:
Okay, this is it.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.546
-Oh, I see.
-How ready are you?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.648
-I'm ready as much as you are.
-(laughs)

35:49.781 --> 35:51.817
NISCHELLE:
They're looking.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.785
I wonder what she's thinking
right now.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.487
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

35:55.621 --> 35:56.988
-Thank you.
-Bye.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.457
Welcome back.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.491
All of you guys
are still smiling,

35:59.625 --> 36:00.492
which is a good thing.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.160
Hi, Suresh. I know, right?

36:02.294 --> 36:03.662
-How are you?
-Yeah, yeah.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.432
ROB: This renovation was
a lot of work,

36:06.565 --> 36:08.834
but I think they're
gonna love it.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.270
UTKARSH:
I think there's so many
little thoughtful touches.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.004
A lot of things that they love
are still there.

36:13.138 --> 36:14.640
hey're gonna be really touched.T

36:14.773 --> 36:17.175
-I've got Dad. You've got Mom.
-Okay. Here we go.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.477
-All right, guys.
-Bye, guys.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.511
-See you in a little bit.
-Have fun.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.679
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.080
-Okay, I trust you.
-Hold on.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.682
I'm gonna put your hand
on the door.

36:23.815 --> 36:26.017
Open the door.
I'm opening it with you.

36:26.151 --> 36:28.654
-All right.
-Now you're going--
Keep your eyes closed.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.188
I'm not opening, trust me.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.023
UTKARSH:
Well, I know my mom,

36:32.157 --> 36:33.692
and she doesn't like keeping
her eyes closed for anything.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.361
Side step.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.995
So the amount of trust
that it took for her

36:37.128 --> 36:38.797
to let us guide her
out the door, that was huge.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.500
One, two, three.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.535
-Open.
-Wow.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.704
Oh, my God!

36:55.347 --> 36:57.449
One, two, three.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.117
-Open.
-Wow.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.353
Oh, my God!

37:01.487 --> 37:02.821
(laughter)

37:03.955 --> 37:05.891
INDU:
The color is just amazing.

37:06.024 --> 37:09.060
-SURESH: Look at that paneling.
-How lovely.

37:09.194 --> 37:12.030
Wow, a fan.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.500
INDU:
Oh, my God, this is lovely.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.569
NISCHELLE: This deck actually
tripled in size

37:17.703 --> 37:19.505
from what you had.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.340
Now you have all the space
in the world

37:21.473 --> 37:23.409
-to lounge
and to dine out here.
-Amazing. Amazing.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.678
-Great job.
-You can have huge parties.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.415
UTKARSH: It's like you're
in your own little tree house.

37:29.548 --> 37:30.516
INDU:
It's so lovely.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.418
That tree looks so beautiful.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.520
There's no way I could have
even dreamt of trying

37:34.653 --> 37:36.722
to do anything like this
on our own.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.257
SURESH: We are really happy
that this tree was saved

37:39.391 --> 37:41.760
because we planted this
35 years ago.

37:41.893 --> 37:45.063
INDU: It's a bit too much
to take in. (laughs)

37:45.196 --> 37:46.832
He wanted to say thank you
to you guys

37:46.932 --> 37:48.667
-in the best way he could.
-I wanted to say thank you.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.602
-Well, we have to
thank him, too.
-Him for doing this.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.572
NISCHELLE:
Oh... getting emotional.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.407
-I love it.
-It's pretty cool, right?

37:55.541 --> 37:56.742
Yeah.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.110
Oh, Mom, that's so cool.

37:59.244 --> 38:02.013
You know, we get to go
on movie sets and Broadway,

38:02.113 --> 38:05.417
-and meet all his
famous friends and...
-Yeah.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.586
-...and this is one more thing.
-Now he does this for us.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.555
This is just the main area,

38:09.688 --> 38:11.122
-but there's so much more.
-Okay. Okay.

38:11.256 --> 38:12.724
You ready to go see
the rest of the patio?

38:12.858 --> 38:13.859
-All right.
-Of course.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.062
Oh, wow.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.299
INDU:
This is amazing.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.638
UTKARSH:
This is, like,
a fancy-pants grill.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.808
-Yeah.
-It's got a smoker,
and you can also do

38:29.941 --> 38:31.610
-a regular grill
with it as well.
-UTKARSH: Yeah.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.144
INDU:
You have to retrain yourself
for grilling.

38:33.278 --> 38:35.747
SURESH:
Yeah, grilling. It's amazing.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.783
UTKARSH: So this is
something that Rob and I

38:37.916 --> 38:39.485
-did together. Okay?
-Okay.

38:39.618 --> 38:43.955
So this is actually a bench
made from the old deck.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.256
-The old deck?
-Wow.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.958
This is what Sabrina did.
Look here.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.828
-INDU: Oh, wow.
-SURESH: That's amazing.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.497
INDU:
That is amazing.

38:51.630 --> 38:52.998
-See those tiny little screws?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.165
-I did that.
-You put those in?

38:54.299 --> 38:55.967
-(laughing)
-How impressive.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.304
INDU: I don't know how
they managed to find

38:59.438 --> 39:01.006
everything that we like.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.341
-We love this kind of chair.
-Yeah, it's lovely.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.677
NISCHELLE:
What are your friends gonna say

39:05.811 --> 39:07.479
-when they come over?
-Nischelle, you have to

39:07.613 --> 39:09.948
come back too, so I can
cook you a nice meal, you know.

39:10.081 --> 39:13.284
Nothing but a word.
Nothing but a word.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.020
-You have to come back.
-Yes! Oh.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.188
UTKARSH:
So the old deck used to be--

39:17.322 --> 39:19.525
-Obviously, right?
The stairs were there.
-INDU: Yeah. Yeah.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.660
UTKARSH:
Rob moved them to there.

39:21.793 --> 39:25.864
This is your new
downstairs entrance.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.199
-And this is your new patio.
-Wow. Yeah.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.468
INDU:
Beautiful.

39:30.836 --> 39:34.372
-And I have a swing chair.
-You do.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.041
INDU: Traditionally,
in the south of India,

39:36.174 --> 39:38.544
there are swings in the houses.
In the old houses.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.546
Ah...

39:40.679 --> 39:43.381
t just feels something specialI
to have that swing there

39:43.515 --> 39:45.851
that I can sit on,
and the fire pit is great.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.553
mean, what can I say about it?I

39:47.686 --> 39:49.621
It's beautiful.

39:50.456 --> 39:51.790
NISCHELLE:
There's one more thing.

39:51.890 --> 39:52.824
SURESH:
You guys have been really busy.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.359
(Nischelle laughs)

39:54.493 --> 39:58.063
This is your new study,
meditation area.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.965
(Indu and Suresh gasping)

40:00.065 --> 40:01.967
SURESH: This doesn't look
like the same room we had.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.040
NISCHELLE:
There's one more thing.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.576
You guys have been really busy.

40:10.709 --> 40:11.877
(laughs)

40:12.010 --> 40:13.845
Ready?

40:13.979 --> 40:16.748
This is your new study,

40:16.882 --> 40:19.585
-meditation area.
-(gasping, laughing)

40:22.387 --> 40:25.090
This doesn't look like
the same room we had.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.592
UTKARSH:
No.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.029
-INDU: Beautiful.
-Incidentally,

40:31.162 --> 40:32.931
I, you know, ripped up
the carpet myself.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.400
I drilled a hole in the ceiling

40:35.534 --> 40:37.068
so that the light could go in.
It's not, you know--

40:37.202 --> 40:38.236
I don't want to take
all the credit,

40:38.369 --> 40:39.370
but most of it goes to me.

40:39.505 --> 40:40.371
Listen, you did a lot.

40:40.506 --> 40:41.773
You did do a lot.

40:41.907 --> 40:42.941
-Yeah.
-Look at these pictures.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.778
UTKARSH:
Sabrina thought it would be

40:46.912 --> 40:49.047
-amazing for you
to see where you started.
-Beautiful.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.682
That's so lovely.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.119
UTKARSH:
March 23, 1979.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.120
-Wow.
-Yes.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.187
It takes you back,

40:56.287 --> 40:58.724
you know, to that day.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.025
And they're lovely,
lovely pictures.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.292
Beautiful pictures.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.395
-Everything is new.
-So beautiful.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.131
The first thing that I see
that was never there

41:06.264 --> 41:08.099
-in this room...
-Is space.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.601
-And light.
-And light.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.036
UTKARSH:
For the first time,

41:11.136 --> 41:13.438
-it's a brightly lit room.
-INDU: Yes.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.641
Now it's just so nice and airy.

41:15.774 --> 41:16.808
And I think that desk is

41:16.942 --> 41:18.443
just the right size for having

41:18.577 --> 41:19.745
just a small, little computer

41:19.878 --> 41:21.446
and a little laptop.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.782
And we have an exercise bike
for you to keep limber.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.584
Very nice of you.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.586
UTKARSH: I think my dad loves
the exercise bike.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.254
He's gonna use it,
and I'm really happy for him.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.824
Final surprise.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.325
(overlapping greetings)

41:34.459 --> 41:36.161
Wow.

41:36.294 --> 41:39.097
-(laughter)
-Hey, Bhumi.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.933
Hi, Bhumi.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.669
-Mwah!
-We didn't expect you.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.303
INDU:
This is the best.

41:45.436 --> 41:48.106
First of all, I got to have
this beautiful deck.

41:48.239 --> 41:50.642
We can live outside.
This is nice.

41:50.776 --> 41:52.343
And then I got to
spend some time

41:52.477 --> 41:54.145
ith my grandkids and my family.w

41:54.279 --> 41:56.982
As parents, we just do what
we need to do.

41:57.115 --> 42:01.452
You don't really expect that
something has to come back.

42:01.587 --> 42:04.189
-So this is just amazing.
-I'm so glad.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.424
Well, we wanted to
do this for you.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.293
INDU:
I think it was just a lovely,

42:08.426 --> 42:10.095
lovely, lovely experience.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.131
Way more than I could have
dreamed about, you know.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.801
SABRINA: Indu and Suresh
are gonna have many years of

42:15.934 --> 42:17.535
building memories here,
and that's what it's all about.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.705
Thank you all for letting us
come here with you.

42:19.838 --> 42:22.708
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.976
To have the opportunity to just
give them something back,

42:25.110 --> 42:26.712
that's beautiful.

42:26.845 --> 42:29.380
That I know they'll use
and that they'll love

42:29.514 --> 42:30.515
is really special.

42:30.649 --> 42:31.983
And now we all get to live

42:32.117 --> 42:33.284
like this together,

42:33.384 --> 42:34.853
-it's pretty cool.
-Now let's party.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.487
(all cheering)
