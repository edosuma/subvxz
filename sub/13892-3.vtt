00:31.500 --> 00:34.650
Listen up pump heads,
Fist Pump is coming to Slammers!!!!

00:34.650 --> 00:37.750
They just got out of jail,
and rehab, and now they're back,

00:37.750 --> 00:41.150
and ready to rock your
11-through-15 year old pants off!

00:41.150 --> 00:44.070
That's our Demographic get over it!
That's right! Fist Pump live!

00:44.070 --> 00:46.470
- At Slammers this Friday!
- FRIDAY!!

00:46.470 --> 00:48.080
Be there or be a loser!

00:48.870 --> 00:51.920
There's gonna be so many losers at that concert.

00:52.810 --> 00:54.710
We have to go to that concert.

00:54.810 --> 00:55.830
Seriously?

00:55.890 --> 00:58.410
Dude, they were cooler in the 3rd grade.
But now--

00:58.410 --> 01:00.650
Correction, they're cool in any grade,

01:00.650 --> 01:01.710
but you wouldn't know that!

01:01.710 --> 01:03.820
Probably because you hate
yourself or something.

01:03.870 --> 01:05.740
Dude, we don't have the money for those tickets.

01:05.740 --> 01:06.790
That doesn't even matter!

01:06.790 --> 01:07.850
We can figure out a way,

01:07.850 --> 01:10.240
but you're to busy figuring out a way to hate yourself.

01:10.310 --> 01:12.160
Why do you wanna go so bad?

01:12.160 --> 01:15.790
Going to this concert could be
the biggest moment of my life.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.120
Wow, sounds like your life sucks.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.470
SHUT UP!!!

01:20.400 --> 01:21.010
Hey guys!

01:21.010 --> 01:22.390
Hey Margaret!

01:22.390 --> 01:23.830
Were you guys talking about the concert?

01:23.830 --> 01:25.830
We were talking about a concert.

01:25.940 --> 01:29.790
Is the concert you're
talking about FIST PUMP????

01:30.940 --> 01:31.940
Yeah cool.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.460
Wait you're going?

01:33.520 --> 01:34.520
Yeah I am,

01:34.600 --> 01:37.790
I know they're kinda old but
I remember them from when I was a kid.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.630
Besides, everyone is gonna be there.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.520
It's gonna be fun. You guys gonna go?

01:42.290 --> 01:43.780
I'm totally gonna go.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.920
Oh so now you're gonna...
owww...

01:46.920 --> 01:48.160
We'll be there!

01:48.160 --> 01:49.840
Cool....see you guys there.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.640
Yeah....see you.

01:52.020 --> 01:56.700
I can't believe you're going to a
Fist Pump Concert just for some lady pecks!

01:56.850 --> 01:57.920
Rigby,

02:04.860 --> 02:06.950
Now, how are we going to get
the money for those tickets?

02:06.950 --> 02:08.729
Dude, it's gonna be easy-

02:08.729 --> 02:10.669
we just have to work some extra hours.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.080
Extra work? I don't even like regular work.

02:13.180 --> 02:14.890
Do you like Fist Pump?

02:14.890 --> 02:15.740
Yes.

02:15.740 --> 02:17.800
Humph, then you like extra work.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.960
Humph, fine.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.740
Let me get this straight-

02:24.740 --> 02:26.860
you and Rigby want me to give you overtime,

02:26.860 --> 02:30.520
and even though you can't even finish
the regular amount of work that you normally have,

02:30.520 --> 02:32.650
you want me to add on even more.

02:32.830 --> 02:33.490
Yes.

02:34.210 --> 02:34.900
No.

02:35.070 --> 02:37.170
Ah, come on Benson, please.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.980
Fist Pump is playing at Slammers
and we don't have enough money for tickets.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.950
Are you serious?

02:41.950 --> 02:43.130
Fist Pump?

02:43.310 --> 02:45.750
You know what kind
of people go to those concerts?

02:45.750 --> 02:49.990
Whoo! That's right ladies,

02:49.990 --> 02:53.040
we got two tickets to Fist Pump,

02:53.520 --> 02:55.600
see ya later grandmas.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.000
Benson, you listen and you listen good.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.340
Please Benson, please give us overtime!

03:03.450 --> 03:04.370
Please?

03:04.370 --> 03:05.820
What is the big deal?

03:06.030 --> 03:07.770
It's Just some talentless band.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.800
Actually, they aren't that bad.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
Not that I'm into that stuff.

03:11.910 --> 03:13.480
We are pretty backed up, though.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.170
I think you should give them the work.

03:15.220 --> 03:16.420
Oh, I agree.

03:16.540 --> 03:21.260
I say if they want to see Pump Fist,
then let them see Pump Fist.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.260
Fine.

03:23.330 --> 03:25.060
You can work overtime. 

03:27.730 --> 03:29.550
Here's a list of things we need done. 

03:29.550 --> 03:30.900
When you finish them, 

03:30.900 --> 03:31.980
you'll get your money. 

03:38.420 --> 03:39.240
 Idiots. 

03:51.700 --> 03:53.490
Dude, I'm fading fast. 

03:53.590 --> 03:54.510
Don't worry, dude. 

03:54.640 --> 03:58.920
We just got to fight it with COFFEEEEE.

04:31.210 --> 04:32.400
Two for fist pump. 

04:33.220 --> 04:34.610
$400. 

04:34.610 --> 04:36.780
What?! But I thought they were $50. 

04:37.520 --> 04:39.360
$50 Tickets are sold out. 

04:39.440 --> 04:42.230
All that's left is super-deluxe front-row seats. 

04:43.250 --> 04:45.380
No, no, no! 

04:45.380 --> 04:47.200
Mordecai, wait. 
Wait man.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.190
We can't give up. 

04:48.370 --> 04:49.930
Fist Pump! 

04:50.080 --> 04:51.280
 I know, dude, but,

04:51.340 --> 04:52.920
I just don't want to work any more-

04:52.920 --> 04:54.330
Oh my...

05:02.320 --> 05:04.230
Maybe I could work a little more. 

05:04.510 --> 05:05.390
All right, dude.

05:05.390 --> 05:06.380
Let's do this. 

05:08.500 --> 05:10.680
You're lucky I care about lady pecs. 

05:12.040 --> 05:13.870
Benson, we need more money. 

05:14.620 --> 05:16.690
Yeah, give us more money. 

05:16.690 --> 05:18.130
There's no chores left,

05:18.410 --> 05:19.380
Unless..

05:19.640 --> 05:21.120
you want to mow the lawn. 

05:21.190 --> 05:23.570
The lawn? 

05:28.380 --> 05:29.590
Oh, what? 

05:29.660 --> 05:31.200
That'll take forever! 

05:31.200 --> 05:32.420
Here's the keys. 

05:32.480 --> 05:33.990
You know where the mower is. 

05:36.850 --> 05:37.800
Good luck. 

05:40.000 --> 05:43.810
Who needs luck when we have COFFEEE!? 

05:47.110 --> 05:52.020
Dude, seriously, though, my eyes won't stay open anymore,
and I think we're almost out of coffee.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.460
Nonsense, dude. 

05:53.580 --> 05:55.460
We've got plenty of coffee. 

05:57.530 --> 05:58.850
Mordecai? 

05:58.850 --> 06:00.160
What happened? 

06:00.160 --> 06:02.160
Need more coffee. 

06:02.290 --> 06:04.460
Need more Margaret.

07:51.710 --> 07:53.040
Mordecai and Rigby,

07:53.040 --> 07:56.230
we are very excited for you 
to be the ones to see fist pump. 

07:56.290 --> 07:59.210
Please accept this coffee to help you make it through concert. 

07:59.300 --> 08:00.130
Thanks. 

08:00.940 --> 08:03.120
Hey, what the- 
this isn't coffee. 

08:05.350 --> 08:07.460
IT'S CHAMOMILE Tea,

08:07.460 --> 08:10.510
the sleepiest of all teas. 

08:10.510 --> 08:11.720
Rigby, get the --

08:13.480 --> 08:14.550
..tickets.

08:21.930 --> 08:24.530
Rigby, come on! They got the tickets. 
Come on, let's go, let's go!

08:25.840 --> 08:27.140
Fist pump. 

08:29.340 --> 08:31.110
Now what are we supposed to do? 

08:31.540 --> 08:33.159
Come on. I have an idea.

08:36.940 --> 08:40.650
You morons! Get back here 
and help me pick up my gum balls!

08:48.320 --> 08:49.940
Give us the tickets! 

09:08.820 --> 09:10.770
Uh, Mordecai and Rigby. 

09:11.560 --> 09:14.630
- Funny seeing you here.
- A chain saw? Are you serious?!

09:14.630 --> 09:16.630
I mean, what's up with the chain saw? 

09:16.670 --> 09:18.180
Coffee! Coffee, coffee!

09:18.180 --> 09:19.690
Why didn't you buys us tickets? 

09:19.720 --> 09:21.200
What are you talking about? 

09:21.200 --> 09:23.140
We never said we'd buy you tickets. 

09:23.140 --> 09:25.200
- But we had a contract.
- Shut it! 

09:26.750 --> 09:28.870
You know, at first I thought you were cool,

09:28.870 --> 09:31.870
but now I know that you're both total losers. 

09:31.870 --> 09:33.250
Everybody hates you. 

09:33.410 --> 09:36.010
Oh, and I just realized something. 

09:36.010 --> 09:36.600
What? 

09:36.680 --> 09:38.620
Your coffee sucks. 

09:46.760 --> 09:48.480
- What's up, Mordecai? 
- Hey dude.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.900
Dude, there they are! 

09:50.860 --> 09:51.960
We did it!

09:51.960 --> 09:53.160
Fist Pump! 

09:53.160 --> 09:55.720
- Fist Pump!
- I wonder where Margaret sittin'?

09:57.120 --> 09:58.200
Aw, sick. 

09:58.230 --> 09:59.480
It's all sweaty.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.690
I just threw my shirt! 

10:03.930 --> 10:06.200
Bring out Fist Pump! 

10:06.200 --> 10:08.330
Let's do it! 

10:08.330 --> 10:09.400
Hey, Mordecai. 

10:09.400 --> 10:12.110
Hey, Margaret! Fist Pump.

10:12.110 --> 10:15.440
Mordecai, you have to meet my boyfriend -- Slasher. 

10:16.360 --> 10:18.900
Hey, Slasher, that's my friend Mordecai. 

10:19.920 --> 10:23.020
You should tell your friend he should stop pumping it in the wind

10:23.020 --> 10:25.020
and start pumping it at the gym. 

10:25.850 --> 10:27.260
Don't be such a jerk. 

10:28.180 --> 10:29.110
You're dead. 

10:31.080 --> 10:32.690
Oh, this sucks. 

10:32.690 --> 10:35.810
Aw, don't worry about her. 
You'll get another chance. 

10:43.020 --> 10:45.970
Dude, wake up!
They're about to come out!

10:45.970 --> 10:46.470
Wait. 

10:46.750 --> 10:48.440
Must.. stay awake..

10:48.700 --> 10:51.820
