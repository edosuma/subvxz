WEBVTT

00:44.169 --> 00:45.003
Hey!

00:45.086 --> 00:48.256
What the hell are you doing?!
You gotta really launch yourself!

00:48.339 --> 00:49.758
Don't be so hard on me.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.052
You can't say that.
We've tried everything else!

00:52.135 --> 00:54.637
Then we don't know
if this will work either.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.514
Are there no other ways?

00:58.475 --> 00:59.392
Well...

01:00.977 --> 01:03.855
-There's one option left.
-What is it? Tell me.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.858
Getting struck by lightning.

01:14.783 --> 01:15.784
<i>It's fine.</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:19.329
<i>Zenko Umine as Ayumi Kohinata is fine.</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:21.915
Umine!

01:24.375 --> 01:25.251
Sorry I'm late.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.921
No worries. I just got here.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.049
-That girl's so cute.
-Wonder if that's her boyfriend.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.678
<i>I have Ayumi Kohinata's body</i>
<i>in my possession.</i>

01:39.516 --> 01:40.391
<i>And...</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:42.560
Shall we go?

01:44.187 --> 01:45.897
<i>the thing I wanted the most...</i>

01:45.980 --> 01:46.815
Yes.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.738
<i>is the happiness I now have.</i>

01:55.406 --> 01:58.034
<i>I never want to go back to being alone.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:01.079
HOW TO SWITCH BODIES

02:01.162 --> 02:03.873
Ah, I just don't know anymore!

02:04.833 --> 02:08.294
All we can do now
is force Umine to spit it out.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.340
There might be

02:13.091 --> 02:14.717
another person who knows.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.010
Huh?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.303
Actually...

02:18.263 --> 02:19.097
<i>You...</i>

02:20.223 --> 02:22.183
<i>switched with someone, didn't you?</i>

02:23.726 --> 02:25.103
Who is this?

02:25.186 --> 02:28.606
<i>If you cooperate with my research,</i>
<i>I'll tell you everything,</i>

02:29.149 --> 02:31.067
<i>even how to switch bodies.</i>

02:32.777 --> 02:34.863
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!

02:34.946 --> 02:37.866
Well, I didn't know if it was true,

02:38.283 --> 02:40.618
-and I was scared--
-So how do we find her?

02:41.494 --> 02:43.496
She said go to her research lab
on the sixth.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.414
The sixth?

02:45.039 --> 02:46.499
-That's today!
-I know...

02:46.583 --> 02:47.625
Where is the lab?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.753
We don't have any other options!

03:11.774 --> 03:12.734
It's a woman, right?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.152
I can take her.

03:27.415 --> 03:28.541
If...

03:29.626 --> 03:30.460
by chance,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.838
the person on the phone
was telling the truth,

03:36.299 --> 03:37.383
it might be possible

03:38.593 --> 03:40.929
for me to go back to normal, right?

03:47.602 --> 03:48.436
Ayumi. Hmm?

03:53.733 --> 03:54.734
If that happens...

04:24.681 --> 04:25.598
Are you...

04:25.682 --> 04:26.724
Don't worry.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.520
I'm not trying to scam you. RED MOON RESEARCHER
MAO UKON

04:32.855 --> 04:34.565
Thank you for bringing the parakeet.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.989
This parakeet only comes near
those who've switched bodies.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.866
-So it knew that I--
-You were serious, right?

04:45.868 --> 04:47.537
About knowing how to change bodies.

04:54.919 --> 04:55.753
Of course I am.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.299
After all,

05:00.466 --> 05:02.093
I switched with someone, too.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.159
Welcome home,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.078
-Amagase.
-What kind of name is that?

06:10.661 --> 06:11.496
Typically,

06:12.038 --> 06:14.123
you conduct your research
on the Red Moon here?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.209
Yes. On the outside, at least.

06:17.418 --> 06:21.005
The data on the Red Moon is crucial
for my business.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.548
Business?

06:23.257 --> 06:25.968
I earn money in exchange
for information about switching.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.056
Appearance, talent, wealth.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.850
Humans are born into disparity.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.770
But with the ability to exchange bodies,

06:36.062 --> 06:38.523
anyone can obtain happiness.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.026
Who were you originally?

06:48.741 --> 06:52.245
Before we get to that,
I'd like to hear your story first.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.768
-Here I go!
-Okay.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.319
Thanks for inviting me out today.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.657
It felt like I was living
in a dream world for the day.

07:30.741 --> 07:31.742
You're exaggerating.

07:33.494 --> 07:37.498
But it's always been my dream
to go on a date with you.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.386
You know,

07:52.180 --> 07:53.806
I initially intended to die.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.391
What?

07:56.267 --> 07:58.811
That's why I wanted to be reborn.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.065
Koshiro...

08:07.028 --> 08:09.489
people's hands are warm, aren't they?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.827
I never want to let go of this hand.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.292
That's why I can't tell you.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.544
I want you to tell me.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.463
How to switch bodies.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.965
I've always wanted to be Kaga.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.259
You're only staying with me

08:30.843 --> 08:32.512
because you want to know, right?

08:35.431 --> 08:37.558
If you betray me,

08:39.936 --> 08:40.770
I...

08:43.064 --> 08:44.357
wouldn't be able to live.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.658
It certainly seems that

08:53.741 --> 08:56.077
Zenko Umine knew the conditions
for the switch.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.246
Conditions?

08:59.205 --> 09:02.291
First, you must commit suicide
when there is a Red Moon.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.877
Then, you must be seen
by the person you wish to be.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.797
And...

09:11.092 --> 09:12.176
you must die.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.804
If these three conditions are met, you can do your first body switch.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.685
Then, next time,

09:21.936 --> 09:23.813
I have to go in front of Umine and...

09:25.773 --> 09:26.649
You'll be fine!

09:27.358 --> 09:29.151
If you succeed, you wouldn't die.

09:29.986 --> 09:30.903
Succeed?

09:31.821 --> 09:33.114
What are you talking about?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.241
I...

09:36.117 --> 09:39.161
I'll do anything to get my body back.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.499
I'm sorry.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.377
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.965
I said I would teach you
how to switch bodies,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.634
but I never said anything
about going back.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.970
What do you mean?

10:00.182 --> 10:02.184
<i>I can return to normal this way, right?</i>

10:03.519 --> 10:05.104
<i>Everything will be fine, right?</i>

10:06.480 --> 10:07.315
<i>I want to...</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:10.526
<i>go back to my old self quickly...</i>

10:11.360 --> 10:13.362
This was what I looked like before.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.074
I had just changed places with her,

10:17.158 --> 10:19.160
but she suddenly wanted to switch back.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.372
Everything about the method was correct,

10:23.831 --> 10:26.083
but for some reason,
we couldn't return to normal.

10:28.002 --> 10:28.961
So...

10:29.754 --> 10:31.130
where is she now?

10:34.925 --> 10:36.344
She died in my body.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.371
There were two other pairs
who tried switching back,

11:03.913 --> 11:06.707
but both groups failed,
each one resulting in someone's death.

11:06.791 --> 11:07.625
In other words,

11:08.501 --> 11:10.503
once people switch with another person,

11:11.170 --> 11:13.381
they can never return
to their original body.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.217
Oh my...

11:16.300 --> 11:18.469
Wait... Wait just a minute!

11:18.803 --> 11:19.929
Is there no other way?

11:20.262 --> 11:21.097
No clue.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.599
Those three groups

11:24.600 --> 11:26.268
could have just happened to fail.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.562
That may be true.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.815
In that case, why don't you try?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.111
If you don't mind dying.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.704
Thanks.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.205
See you tomorrow.

11:49.125 --> 11:49.959
Umine.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.338
What happened...

11:55.798 --> 11:57.049
to make you want to die?

12:01.345 --> 12:02.221
I...

12:06.934 --> 12:08.144
am not Umine anymore.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.069
Good night.

12:35.838 --> 12:36.881
I'll walk you home.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.009
I...

12:41.677 --> 12:42.678
will be fine.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.263
-Yeah, but--
-Sorry.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.975
I just want to be alone.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.033
<i>I can't go back.</i>

13:08.746 --> 13:10.456
<i>I can never...</i>

13:15.753 --> 13:16.837
<i>go back to normal.</i>

13:20.508 --> 13:21.425
<i>Why don't you try?</i>

13:22.384 --> 13:23.511
<i>If you don't mind dying.</i>

13:26.430 --> 13:27.348
<i>Mom...</i> <i>Dad...</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:10.850
-Okay! It's ready.
-Ooh!

14:11.475 --> 14:14.478
Finally it's here!
Bring on the<i> nabe,</i> Watanabe!

14:14.687 --> 14:17.022
-He's at it again.
-In English, it's called a "pot."

14:17.106 --> 14:18.816
-I know!
-Oh, really?

14:21.902 --> 14:24.655
-Okay, opening the "pot!"
-We know already!

14:25.281 --> 14:26.574
You really like saying that.

14:43.924 --> 14:44.758
Ayumi!

14:50.139 --> 14:51.098
Kaga...

14:54.685 --> 14:55.561
Why?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.397
You don't have go back to normal. It doesn't matter how you look.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.863
You don't have to smile every day,
or be strong,

15:06.238 --> 15:07.239
or not be depressed.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.783
I, alone,

15:10.951 --> 15:12.745
will love you in everyone else's place.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.541
I love you,

15:18.334 --> 15:19.209
Ayumi.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.258
Ayumi.

15:34.934 --> 15:35.976
Koshiro?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.184
What was that just now?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.353
Just now?

16:21.522 --> 16:22.523
I love you,

16:23.315 --> 16:24.149
Ayumi.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.860
That was--

16:26.944 --> 16:28.362
About not returning to normal?

16:33.575 --> 16:34.618
That was...

16:40.708 --> 16:41.667
Actually,

16:43.544 --> 16:46.338
I met someone who knows
how to switch bodies.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.340
And--

16:48.924 --> 16:50.092
Tell me

16:50.175 --> 16:51.510
every detail about that.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.556
Goddammit!

16:59.143 --> 16:59.977
Ah, jeez! That's why...

17:09.653 --> 17:10.612
I can never...

17:12.114 --> 17:14.450
go back to my original body.

17:22.958 --> 17:23.959
Koshiro?

17:28.505 --> 17:29.339
Thank you

17:30.340 --> 17:31.300
for telling me.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.344
Here.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.142
You remembered.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.067
It's been a while
since we've talked like this.

17:49.985 --> 17:50.819
Yeah.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.492
<i>I can't be happy about this.</i>

17:57.493 --> 17:59.161
<i>I can't tell him I love him.</i>

18:00.496 --> 18:01.872
<i>Koshiro is now</i>

18:03.040 --> 18:05.000
<i>Umine's boyfriend.</i>

18:08.003 --> 18:08.962
Will you date Kaga?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.048
Huh?

18:14.384 --> 18:17.888
I've thought for a while now
that you two would make a better match.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.142
See ya.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.111
<i>Just as I thought,</i>

18:33.195 --> 18:37.241
<i>Koshiro doesn't think anything</i>
<i>of me anymore.</i>

18:55.008 --> 18:56.009
Kaga.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.267
If you're concerned about Koshiro,
don't worry.

19:03.725 --> 19:07.187
He was only interested in
learning how to switch.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.147
That's not it.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.525
I waited for you because...

19:13.193 --> 19:14.820
I wanted to apologize to you.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.407
I'm sorry!

19:22.661 --> 19:26.665
For expressing how I feel
while you're having a rough time.

19:33.130 --> 19:33.964
And...

19:35.465 --> 19:38.594
to be honest,
I have no idea what Koshiro is thinking.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.097
After you changed with her,

19:43.515 --> 19:44.975
he still had feelings for you.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.894
Ayumi!

19:47.227 --> 19:48.896
I came to help you that time

19:49.605 --> 19:50.689
only thanks to him.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.443
<i>Go to the classroom now.</i>

19:54.860 --> 19:57.404
<i>When you find Ayumi,</i>
<i>open the curtain immediately.</i>

19:59.781 --> 20:01.408
Confessing to you

20:03.911 --> 20:05.621
without telling you that

20:06.455 --> 20:07.372
seems cowardly.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.333
Kaga...

20:11.418 --> 20:12.252
Ayumi.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.967
Focus on yourself for now.

20:26.808 --> 20:27.976
No matter what happens,

20:30.270 --> 20:32.064
I'll be right there, cheering you on.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.067
Thank you. Yeah.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.216
What time do you think it is?

21:02.302 --> 21:03.136
I'm sorry.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.182
Are you working tonight, too?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.434
Going to play pachinko.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.190
<i>From now on,</i>

21:15.899 --> 21:18.068
<i>this woman will be my mom.</i>

21:23.365 --> 21:24.908
<i>This will be my home.</i>

21:27.953 --> 21:32.582
<i>I have no choice but to live this way</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

21:56.189 --> 22:00.569
CONDITIONS FOR THE EXCHANGING OF BODIES

22:04.865 --> 22:07.409
<i>As long as the process is correct,</i>
<i>the switch will occur.</i>

22:08.702 --> 22:10.245
<i>Me and Kaga.</i>

22:37.814 --> 22:39.983
Kaga, were you waiting for me?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.234
Yeah. Um,

22:43.487 --> 22:44.821
about yesterday...

22:49.743 --> 22:51.536
Please let me copy your homework!

22:52.871 --> 22:53.705
Huh?

22:53.789 --> 22:55.374
I was playing games till 1:00 a.m. Sorry, I can't.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.795
Wait, please--

22:59.878 --> 23:01.254
It's not that.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.840
I forgot, too.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.719
You're supposed to come prepared!

23:07.803 --> 23:09.054
You're not one to talk.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.473
I didn't say that.
But you always do your homeowrk!

23:12.557 --> 23:14.059
Ah jeez, what're we gonna do?

23:14.434 --> 23:18.605
<i>Never once did Kaga talk about</i>
<i>what happened yesterday.</i>

23:21.149 --> 23:25.487
<i>He's most likely giving me time</i>
<i>to think it over slowly.</i>

23:25.904 --> 23:26.738
Kaga!

23:28.407 --> 23:29.282
You got a minute?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.450
Yeah.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.662
-See you later.
-Yeah.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.666
<i>Knowing how he feels,</i>

23:37.749 --> 23:40.335
<i>I'm not sure how I'll answer him.</i>

23:40.419 --> 23:42.587
<i>I wonder if it's okay for me</i>
<i>to depend on him.</i>

23:46.174 --> 23:49.052
Lately, you've distanced yourself
from Ayumi and Mizumoto.

23:52.013 --> 23:52.931
What about it?

23:53.306 --> 23:55.308
Mizumoto is your best friend.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.687
Plus, you like Ayumi.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.022
What? You're crazy. There's no way--

24:01.106 --> 24:02.566
You're such a bad liar.

24:03.150 --> 24:06.403
Other than Ayumi,
everyone in class already knows.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.904
-What?!
-So...

24:07.988 --> 24:11.783
-what happened?
-You're not with Zenko, are you?

24:14.411 --> 24:17.080
Fine. I'll tell only you two.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.417
-I like Umine.
-Huh?

24:20.500 --> 24:23.879
It started during the school festival,
and now I'm trying to appeal to her.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.382
Do not tell anyone!

24:27.466 --> 24:28.550
Seriously?!

24:33.555 --> 24:34.389
Hey!

24:34.473 --> 24:36.516
-I just heard something crazy.
-What?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.268
Kaga...

24:38.602 --> 24:41.271
likes Umine!

24:43.440 --> 24:45.192
No way. That's impossible.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.735
-That Umine?
-Liar!

24:46.818 --> 24:47.652
I'm serious! <i>What?</i>

24:49.821 --> 24:51.865
I heard it from the horse's mouth. Right?

24:51.948 --> 24:52.908
I heard it, too.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.286
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

24:57.412 --> 25:00.165
<i>For someone to like her</i>
<i>looking like that is unthinkable.</i>

25:00.248 --> 25:04.044
And how does Umine feel about this?

25:04.586 --> 25:05.545
Huh?

25:05.629 --> 25:07.214
What do you think of Kaga?

25:08.131 --> 25:09.132
Hmm?

25:09.216 --> 25:11.218
Tell us, tell us!

25:11.718 --> 25:13.762
Stop it! That's enough.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.138
Don't mess with her.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.139
<i>Wait,</i>

25:16.223 --> 25:18.099
<i>is he serious?</i>

25:18.850 --> 25:20.435
Got it. It's a joke, right?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.646
Starting today,

25:22.729 --> 25:26.316
I, Shunpei Kaga,
am attracted to ugly girls!

25:33.615 --> 25:35.492
<i>What are you doing, Kaga?</i>

25:37.786 --> 25:39.746
<i>Hurry up and deny it!</i>

25:40.121 --> 25:40.956
<i>Go on.</i>

25:41.873 --> 25:43.750
<i>Tell everyone you hate ugly girls!</i>

25:43.833 --> 25:45.001
What's wrong with that?!

25:51.716 --> 25:52.592
To me,

25:55.011 --> 25:56.846
Umine is the cutest as she is now.

26:48.648 --> 26:49.649
Did I...

26:54.946 --> 26:55.822
Did I...

26:57.282 --> 26:59.784
do something to deserve to be laughed at?

27:11.963 --> 27:16.509
Before... you laugh at me...

27:19.179 --> 27:20.847
before you hate me...

27:23.391 --> 27:25.268
I want you to know more about me.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.610
Just try touching my cheek!

27:41.242 --> 27:42.077
Maria.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.595
It's so soft! I could do this all day!

28:01.262 --> 28:03.139
-Right?
-Can I try?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.518
It really does feel nice!

28:06.601 --> 28:07.686
Let me try, too!

28:08.478 --> 28:09.604
It feels good!

28:10.063 --> 28:10.897
Seriously?

28:15.902 --> 28:17.821
Hey, wait a minute, all of you!

28:17.946 --> 28:20.407
-Hundred yen per pinch.
-You're charging us?!

28:20.490 --> 28:23.201
Of course. It took 16 years
for those cheeks to mature.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.204
Kaga, knock it off.

28:27.038 --> 28:27.997
Everyone,

28:28.456 --> 28:29.416
fifty yen is fine.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.168
She's still charging us!

28:45.348 --> 28:47.016
They're saying she's cute?!

28:47.100 --> 28:48.643
Are they trying to spite me?!

28:49.227 --> 28:51.438
Kaga and Ayumi Kohinata are the same.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.733
They understand nothing
since they were blessed with good looks.

28:54.816 --> 28:58.069
Do you know how much I suffered
because I looked like that?

29:00.655 --> 29:03.116
I will never forgive Kaga.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.127
Suffered?

29:15.920 --> 29:19.048
-What happened, Umine?
-I told you I'm not Umine anymore!

29:19.132 --> 29:19.966
That's right.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.179
But... I want to know
everything about you.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.433
Because I'm...

29:29.809 --> 29:30.769
your boyfriend now.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.285
I was...

29:49.120 --> 29:50.288
always alone.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.753
What should we do about our field trip
group? Shouldn't we ask Umine?

29:56.836 --> 29:59.631
It'll be embarrassing to walk next to her.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.008
We can just have her do something else.

30:02.133 --> 30:02.967
Yeah!

30:03.092 --> 30:06.429
She'll have special treatment
and do everything individually!

30:06.513 --> 30:08.014
That's a great idea!

30:08.097 --> 30:10.141
Then let's have her go home alone.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.728
The loser has to touch Umine!

30:13.812 --> 30:15.647
-That's perfect!
-Are you serious?!

30:15.730 --> 30:17.398
There she is. Hurry up and do it!

30:17.524 --> 30:18.775
Get going!

30:20.443 --> 30:21.611
Ew, he touched her!

30:26.032 --> 30:27.158
Did you see that girl?

30:27.325 --> 30:28.660
Her bangs are awful.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.412
So gross! No one does that.

30:31.746 --> 30:35.959
<i>For the rest of my life,</i>
<i>I thought I would always be alone.</i>

30:40.713 --> 30:42.090
<i>During that time,</i>

30:42.173 --> 30:43.925
<i>I met you, Koshiro.</i>

30:44.467 --> 30:45.343
Umine.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.056
I'll help you.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.851
I can do it alone.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.332
It's faster with two people.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.419
<i>I told myself not to get my hopes up.</i>

31:20.670 --> 31:21.838
<i>That's because</i>

31:22.589 --> 31:24.424
<i>I would just be betrayed in the end.</i>

31:32.807 --> 31:33.933
<i>My dad</i>

31:35.101 --> 31:37.437
<i>left me behind without a word.</i>

31:41.107 --> 31:44.360
<i>After that, my relationship</i>
<i>with my mom soured.</i>

31:44.444 --> 31:46.487
Don't infect me. I can't take off work.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.573
Then don't come home anymore, hag.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.867
For who do you think I'm working?!

32:04.923 --> 32:07.592
<i>My mom kept me at a distance.</i>

32:14.515 --> 32:16.476
Umine, are you okay?

32:17.560 --> 32:19.270
You can look at my notes if you want.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.023
I don't need it.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.108
Oh, okay.

32:24.817 --> 32:27.487
<i>I've always hated Ayumi Kohinata</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

32:27.570 --> 32:30.865
<i>She's just an attractive wolf</i>
<i>in sheep's clothing.</i>

32:34.494 --> 32:38.498
<i>There was no one</i>
<i>who ever truly cared about me.</i>

32:40.291 --> 32:41.125
<i>But...</i>

32:43.461 --> 32:46.130
<i>only you were always kind to me.</i>

32:47.340 --> 32:49.509
What... is this?

32:52.136 --> 32:54.514
It's hard to keep up
after missing four classes.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.563
If you don't use it, toss it out.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.281
<i>You start to hope</i>
<i>when things like that happen.</i>

33:15.952 --> 33:17.078
<i>I thought that maybe</i>

33:18.037 --> 33:21.165
<i>you would accept</i>
<i>even an ugly girl like me.</i>

33:21.249 --> 33:25.294
MIZUMOTO, I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.847
TO MIZUMOTO

33:38.474 --> 33:41.102
KOSHIRO MIZUMOTO

34:04.125 --> 34:05.960
I thought I should tell you.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.255
I'm confessing my feelings

34:10.715 --> 34:11.549
to Ayumi. I see.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.098
Good luck.

34:31.778 --> 34:33.029
<i>In that moment,</i>

34:36.407 --> 34:38.284
<i>my guts fell out.</i>

34:42.163 --> 34:45.083
Being born ugly was a mistake itself.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.963
If you're not pretty,
then no one will love you.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.551
That's why I risked my life
to steal it all.

34:55.718 --> 34:58.387
Ayumi Kohinata's life,
her body, everything!

34:59.722 --> 35:03.392
She had a pretty face,
friends, and everything else,

35:03.476 --> 35:05.561
but she had to take you from me, too?

35:06.062 --> 35:10.399
She didn't realize how blessed she was
and lived without a care in the world.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.153
But I...

35:14.862 --> 35:17.448
would never be needed by anyone.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.492
I suffered...

35:21.577 --> 35:22.537
and I suffered...

35:24.539 --> 35:25.498
and I suffered.

35:27.708 --> 35:28.876
If I died,

35:31.170 --> 35:33.422
there would be no one to cry over me.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.636
The only thing left for me was to die.

35:42.890 --> 35:43.808
I finally,

35:45.643 --> 35:47.645
finally switched with her.

35:50.815 --> 35:54.694
Why must I still endure
these painful memories?!

35:57.780 --> 35:59.198
Ayumi aside,

36:00.783 --> 36:02.660
Kaga is still an eyesore.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.039
I'll steal Kaga's life for you next.

36:10.084 --> 36:13.337
I learned how to definitively change
with others.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.590
-From who?
-Don't look at me that way.

36:17.967 --> 36:20.761
I will never leave your side.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.180
Even so, don't do that.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.473
I like you the way you are now!

36:24.557 --> 36:25.558
You've misunderstood.

36:25.808 --> 36:26.642
Huh?

36:27.351 --> 36:29.187
I'm not switching with Kaga.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.024
He will switch with Ayumi.

37:09.602 --> 37:10.853
During the next Red Moon

37:12.563 --> 37:14.690
I will end their lives.
