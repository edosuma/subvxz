01:58.000 --> 02:01.390
We got out of the car
and got swept down the stream.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.433
We caught on a tree,

02:03.960 --> 02:06.076
and my father-in-law

02:07.440 --> 02:10.591
lost his footing
and asked me to grab the girl.

02:10.960 --> 02:15.795
I grabber her, but slipped,
and the little girl went.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.957
Shortly after that
the little boy he went,

02:21.880 --> 02:26.829
and soon after that my wife,
father-in-law and the baby,

02:27.440 --> 02:28.395
they went too.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.070
The three children
that were lost,

02:33.320 --> 02:38.155
their ages, the oldest was six,
and the middle one was four

02:38.360 --> 02:39.952
and the baby was three.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.275
They haven't found the baby
and the oldest boy yet.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.675
The little girl we have
and that's all.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.076
To stop the devastation,
the waste,

02:53.680 --> 02:56.433
the loss of life caused by
the Tennessee River at flood,

02:57.360 --> 03:01.672
the Congress of the United States,
on May 18th 1933,

03:02.040 --> 03:06.636
created a vast new agency called
The Tennessee Valley Authority,

03:06.880 --> 03:08.950
or TVA,

03:09.360 --> 03:14.309
and authorised it to build
a series of dams along the river.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.034
At the same time,
the Tennessee Valley authority

03:19.240 --> 03:22.232
had to buy all the land
along the shore of the river

03:22.520 --> 03:24.636
and all its islands.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.756
Some people had lived on
this land for generations.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.793
Some people refused to sell,
under any persuasion whatsoever.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.549
Garthville.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.159
Hi, I'm Chuck Glover.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.553
I'm Betty Jackson.
I was Mr. Biggs secretary.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.639
Do I inherit you, too?

04:14.120 --> 04:17.714
I don't know. Mr. Biggs left
so suddenly he didn't say.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.033
You're inherited.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.315
What desk should I use?

04:24.240 --> 04:26.151
That was Mr. Biggs desk.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.754
Thank you.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.549
What's the matter?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.391
I thought they'd send
an older man.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.433
No, they sent a younger one.
Shall we get to work?

04:37.760 --> 04:39.512
I'll get the folder
on Garth Island.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.073
Getting the old lady off Garth
is difficult.

04:44.680 --> 04:48.673
You're the third one
they've sent to try.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.390
Ella Garth versus Washington.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.959
Poor old Mr. Biggs
was disgusted when he quit.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.868
I'll bet he was.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.789
Maybe, it could be
he went about it the wrong way.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.799
That man did everything
anybody could do.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.356
He begged and pleaded with her,
but she won't budge an inch.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.711
That's the American way of life.
Rugged individualism is our heritage.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.392
3000 people sell,
and Ella Garth won't sell.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.109
We applaud that spirit,
we admire it, we believe in it,

05:21.320 --> 05:23.629
but we must get her out of there.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.674
The dam is finished

05:28.240 --> 05:31.789
and once they close those gates
and the water starts to rise...

05:34.400 --> 05:37.358
Well, we've not only
got to get her out of there,

05:37.560 --> 05:41.314
but we must get the land cleared,
the houses and trees down...

05:41.760 --> 05:43.478
Be careful!

05:43.840 --> 05:45.751
I guess I'm not telling you
anything new.

05:46.520 --> 05:51.310
Betty, how would you go about
getting her off the island?

05:51.720 --> 05:53.199
I'd let her drown.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.039
That's one way.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.833
How many...?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.191
Is that the island?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.836
Everyone of them
bought up except that one.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.072
How many Garth's live there?

06:08.280 --> 06:11.477
There's many,
but that old women, she's it.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.955
They've been told
the island will be flooded?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.196
About a million times.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.638
I guess I'll go out
and talk to her.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.838
You do that.

06:25.880 --> 06:29.589
It's not that I think I can talk
any better than the others,

06:30.680 --> 06:35.435
but I think we often underestimate
the intelligence of people.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.635
We can talk to them
and they'll listen.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.553
Well...

06:42.520 --> 06:43.748
Well, what?

06:44.520 --> 06:46.431
Let's see how you feel
in a few days.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.712
I'm off to see the Mayor.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.511
He's in charge of
clearing the land.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.314
Wish me luck.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.320
Have your cards and stamps
in your hands.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.873
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-We've been waiting, Mr. Davis.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.230
Could you tell me
where I'd find the Mayor?

07:17.880 --> 07:19.518
In the barber shop.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.039
Is the Mayor still in there?

07:25.280 --> 07:26.793
Yeah, sure.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.075
Mayor Maynard?

07:36.280 --> 07:37.554
Be with you in just a minute.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.069
All right.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.118
The only way to get her off
the island is to get a U.S. Marshal.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.948
Except, we can't use force.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.393
We're having trouble enough
in Washington.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.115
Some Senators are solidly
opposed to these dams.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.869
-Tom, how long are you going to be?
-I'll cut your hair tomorrow.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.313
We've got to get
those Garths off the island.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.555
Bottled it Friday.

08:04.760 --> 08:09.311
With no dispossess, no marshals,
and no bad publicity in the papers.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.715
You'll never do it.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.474
I'll do it.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.958
I mean, I'll try to do it.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.992
There must be some way,
don't you think?

08:31.320 --> 08:32.434
Stay where you are.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.231
There'll be 20 feet of water there.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.592
We're a little behind schedule,

08:41.960 --> 08:44.793
but we'll make it
before the winter rains.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.908
Why don't you get more men?

08:48.480 --> 08:49.799
Can't. Unless we use coloured.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.795
Well?

08:52.040 --> 08:54.031
Use coloured
and the whites would quit.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.070
For a minute there
I forgot where I was.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.908
Here we are.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.428
There's the island.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.999
It looks deserted.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.429
It's not. They're there.
They know you're here.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.749
I suppose that means me.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.632
T.V.A. KEEP OFF

10:03.840 --> 10:04.989
Nobody else.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.474
Well.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.389
Here I go.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.074
Good luck.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.713
After all what can they
do to me?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.273
Just pull yourself over.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.399
And let me know
how you come out.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.548
I will.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.714
Hi, men.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.953
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.395
Good afternoon.
I'm from the TVA.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.875
And...

13:12.280 --> 13:15.033
I saw your sign, unfortunately
I had to disregard it.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.395
I'd like to talk to you.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.872
Would you give me
a few minutes?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.239
If I was you I'd go now.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.678
Would you give speak to me?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.269
I have a problem.

13:49.600 --> 13:54.469
We've just built this big dam
down the river,

13:55.160 --> 13:58.072
and pretty soon
this whole place will be water.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.473
Everywhere it's going to be water.

14:00.680 --> 14:01.954
That's wonderful.

14:03.160 --> 14:03.990
What's your name?

14:04.200 --> 14:05.315
Barbara Ann.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.469
I'm five years old.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.596
You're what?

14:08.800 --> 14:09.755
Five years old.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.270
You're not five.
You're at least six.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.398
No, I'm only five.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.631
Barbara Ann!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.069
Yes, Mama?

14:21.800 --> 14:25.634
Barbara Ann,
where are the men working?

14:25.880 --> 14:27.074
Barbara Ann, come in here.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.515
Yes, Mama.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.074
Uncle Hamilton and Uncle Cal
are by the stream.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.916
You mean, you get catfish
bigger than that?

15:14.120 --> 15:15.678
Some are bigger,
some are smaller.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.868
Well...

15:23.320 --> 15:24.992
about what I came to discuss...

15:25.200 --> 15:27.668
Why don't you get out of here?
We don't want any trouble.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.430
Trouble?

15:29.640 --> 15:30.914
You're from the Government,
ain't you?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.314
Yes.

15:32.520 --> 15:33.748
Go on about your business.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.278
My business is with you.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.872
Ma said we wasn't to talk
to you.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.390
You have to talk to me.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.635
We do?

15:44.840 --> 15:48.833
Look, you know as well as I know
that you must leave here.

15:49.760 --> 15:54.356
TVA has offered you a fair price
and a new place just as good.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.948
What have you got
against a new place?

15:58.920 --> 15:59.909
Too much work.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.835
You work here, don't you?

16:02.240 --> 16:03.116
No, sir.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.435
Who does?

16:07.120 --> 16:09.111
You don't do any work at all?

16:10.360 --> 16:11.509
How do you manage that?

16:12.760 --> 16:13.954
Just never started.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.710
Ma owns this property
and she ain't gonna sell it.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.710
Certainly I can understand
how a senile old woman

16:25.920 --> 16:28.992
would be sentimental about a place
and not want to leave.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.079
Perhaps, she doesn't understand
what it's all about.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.918
Ma understands everything.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.875
If she understands, then what
is she doing? These floods...

16:37.080 --> 16:38.593
Ma knows about the floods.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.949
Then I really don't understand!

16:40.160 --> 16:43.789
Now, you just quiet down.
We ain't stupid.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.195
I didn't say you were.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.358
-Been reading your mind.
-Mister, Ma ain't selling.

16:48.920 --> 16:52.993
It's up to you to make her sell.
Are you all afraid of her?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.874
Joe John.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.952
Don't say nothing against Ma.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.238
What am I saying against her?

17:03.680 --> 17:04.635
I'm saying that

17:05.880 --> 17:09.349
if your mother is senile
it's up to you

17:09.760 --> 17:11.557
to make her understand
she has to leave.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.669
Ma ain't gonna.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.150
She is gonna.
You know that.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.114
Joe John.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.391
Mister, you'd better go now.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.759
Not until I talk to your mother.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.228
Come on, take me up there.
What's so funny?

17:29.120 --> 17:30.348
What's senile?

17:31.600 --> 17:32.635
Crazy.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.190
He says Ma is crazy?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.630
I never saw so many men
afraid of one...

17:36.840 --> 17:37.670
What are you doing?

17:37.880 --> 17:40.599
Hey, hey. Let me go!
Let go of me!

18:00.800 --> 18:04.349
-Wake up, Mr. Penner.
-What time is it, Mrs. Riggs?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.994
October,
and you haven't got a job yet.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.955
Want to buy a duck?
I'll sell Goo-Goo cheap.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.749
I've been swimming.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.191
Hello, Glover?
You sure got her off in a hurry.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.992
Now start getting the land cleared.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.112
What do you mean I got her off?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.350
What's holding you up?

18:39.760 --> 18:42.718
I've been here one half day.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.590
Yes. There's a possibility
that Biggs was right,

18:48.800 --> 18:50.870
the only way to get her off
may be by force.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.354
We can't use force.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.797
What?
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.159
A couple of senators
have got their teeth into us.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.874
They'll use any incident
to destroy us.

19:02.240 --> 19:06.199
I know that.
I'll call you in a couple of days.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.712
Right. Goodbye.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.675
You wanted to see me?

19:13.640 --> 19:17.394
Too bad about this afternoon.
Old Joe John is unpredictable.

19:19.000 --> 19:19.955
What do you want?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.191
Ma says you got an apology
coming to you.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.957
She's sorry about what happened.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.995
Cal and Joe John are sorry.
Carol, she's sorry, too.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.194
And me, I'm all busted up
about it.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.196
If you come tomorrow,
Ma will talk to you.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.871
You better hang them up,
they'll get crinkled down there.

19:46.040 --> 19:46.711
What time?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.956
Any time.
We don't go no place.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.479
The say that President Roosevelt
has a new government, you know.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.319
It's called the New Deal.
What do you think of that?

20:06.560 --> 20:09.393
You know anything
about Mr. Roosevelt, son?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.235
Yes ma'am.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.115
I tell you Mr. Roosevelt
is gonna flood this island.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.039
Yes, sir.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.915
He's going to take the best land
in these parts

20:21.120 --> 20:24.590
and put it right smack
under the Tennessee river.

20:25.440 --> 20:29.991
You know these politicians,
they gotta get the votes.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.676
Yes, they gotta get
the votes somehow.

20:35.640 --> 20:40.589
So the President, he sits up there
in that big White House,

20:40.840 --> 20:45.789
and says, "This country
is just going to the dogs."

20:47.120 --> 20:52.069
And the only way he can figure
to do anything to stop it

20:52.640 --> 20:55.279
is to put my island under water.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.753
What do you think of that?

20:59.520 --> 21:00.873
I'm telling you this

21:02.720 --> 21:05.951
because our friend,

21:06.560 --> 21:10.633
in this end cabin here
sneaked off last night.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.589
Yes, sir.
He just slipped out with his family,

21:15.800 --> 21:17.950
in the middle of the night.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.350
I ain't blaming him.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.110
I ain't blaming him

21:26.320 --> 21:30.029
because nobody wants
to be put under water permanent.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.752
But I'm telling you all
right now,

21:36.040 --> 21:39.794
don't go sneaking off
in the middle of the night.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.949
Any of you want to go?
Any of you want to leave?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.308
The ferry is down there
waiting for you

21:51.520 --> 21:54.398
just any time you want to go.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.151
Nobody keeping you here.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.355
Hi.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.993
You go off and join the government.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.953
I understand they're gonna
put you on relief.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.395
Now you just go
and get yourselves relieved

22:20.240 --> 22:22.071
any time you want.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.634
Me, I ain't going.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.914
Sam.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.270
Yes, Mrs. Ella?

22:31.560 --> 22:34.472
How's "Old Blue"
running these days?

22:34.680 --> 22:35.795
He's all right, Mrs. Ella.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.510
I decided I gonna buy
"Old Blue", Sam.

22:42.040 --> 22:42.916
What's that?

22:43.520 --> 22:46.876
You heard me,
I said I want to buy "Old Blue".

22:47.640 --> 22:48.959
How much you want for him?

22:50.240 --> 22:51.593
I wouldn't want to sell "Old Blue".

22:51.800 --> 22:53.916
I didn't ask
if you wanted to sell him.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.833
I say I'm gonna buy him.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.636
I gonna give you...
I'll give you 15 dollars for him.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.233
What's the matter?
He ain't worth more than that.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.029
No.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.317
He ain't worth nothing,
but I ain't selling him.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.910
You gotta sell him
because I'm going to buy him.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.156
How am I gonna buy him
unless you sell him?

23:20.720 --> 23:22.199
I don't know,
but I ain't gonna sell him.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.437
Sam Johnson,
You is selling him.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.029
No I ain't gonna.

23:26.680 --> 23:30.036
"Old Blue" is mine and I ain't
gonna sell him even to you.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.519
You ain't got no right
to make me.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.553
That's true, Sam.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.956
And come to think of it,
I don't have the right.

23:53.920 --> 23:57.959
You see, young man,
Sam and me, we don't sell.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.551
Sam don't sell his dog

24:02.480 --> 24:06.678
and I don't sell my land that
I've poured my heart's blood into.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.039
Joe John.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.711
Joe John is real sorry
for what he done yesterday.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.035
Ain't you, son?

24:42.240 --> 24:43.719
That's all right, Joe John.

24:49.800 --> 24:50.949
Mrs. Garth,

24:54.160 --> 24:55.957
sometimes it happens

24:57.000 --> 25:00.959
we can't remain true to our beliefs
without hurting many people,

25:02.400 --> 25:04.516
and I'm afraid
this is one of those times.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.794
You're the only person
who hasn't sold here.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.991
That's all right with me.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.311
Granma.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.589
Yes, Carol?

25:16.240 --> 25:17.912
What?

25:21.040 --> 25:22.234
Nothing.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.234
Young man, do you know
anything at all about land?

25:30.400 --> 25:33.312
I believe so,
that's why I was sent down here.

25:34.680 --> 25:38.878
When you go back to the ferry
pick up a handful of soil.

25:39.840 --> 25:40.989
That's real bottom.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.790
Thousands of tonnes of it
are being washed away every year.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.677
Mrs. Garth, you don't love
the land. You love your land.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.914
You know the Tennessee River
is a killer.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.913
Year after year
it's taken many lives.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.796
Isn't it plain common sense
to want to harness it?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.079
You know what that will mean?

26:03.840 --> 26:08.277
Today, 98 of the people
in this valley have no electricity.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.957
The dam will bring them
the electricity.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.229
I expect that's what you call
progress, isn't it?

26:16.840 --> 26:18.273
No, sir.
I don't.

26:19.760 --> 26:24.709
Taking away peoples souls,
putting electricity in place of them

26:25.040 --> 26:28.077
ain't progress.
Not the way I see it.

26:28.280 --> 26:32.751
We're not doing that. We're giving
them a chance to have a soul.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.310
And it isn't just this dam.
It's dam after dam after dam.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.591
We aim to tame this whole river.

26:41.080 --> 26:45.915
You do? I like things running wild.
Like nature meant.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.791
There's already enough dams
locking things up, taming them,

26:51.680 --> 26:55.878
making them go against
their natural wants and needs.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.391
I'm against dams of any kind.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.553
You can get me off by force,
I reckon.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.596
It won't take much force,
but it will take some.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.870
That's the only way
you'll ever get me off here,

27:26.880 --> 27:29.553
because I ain't going
against nature

27:31.360 --> 27:35.911
and I ain't crawling
for no damn government.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.632
Mrs. Garth, we don't want
to put you off by force.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.508
What's going to happen to you?

27:52.720 --> 27:53.914
Me?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.274
I'll show you.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.950
If you come with me,
I'll show you.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.109
Now, read it out.

28:31.280 --> 28:35.353
"Woodbridge Garth,
born 1839, died 1889".

28:37.840 --> 28:38.955
Now that one.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.550
"Ella Garth,
born 1853, died..."

28:48.200 --> 28:52.830
I stay right here
in this land.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.197
The water would never
come up this far, would it?

29:01.080 --> 29:02.559
Young man,

29:03.680 --> 29:07.832
my husband come down this river

29:08.160 --> 29:10.276
in a flat bottom boat

29:12.080 --> 29:14.116
when he was nothing but a boy.

29:16.880 --> 29:21.556
There wasn't even a road
anywhere then.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.598
He was looking for an island.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.233
And he took this one.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.917
That near field there

29:36.200 --> 29:39.397
was all trees, you know.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.673
That one down there
nothing but a damn swamp.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.117
He cleared it.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.993
He drained the fields,
he cleaned the brush,

29:54.920 --> 29:57.275
he cut down them trees.

29:58.160 --> 30:02.676
He worked himself to death
just to make these fields

30:04.680 --> 30:08.070
and he told me never to get off,

30:09.440 --> 30:10.953
and I ain't.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.115
I ain't.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.112
I'm getting a little tired.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.112
Goodbye.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.270
Why haven't you gotten her off?
You know what's coming.

31:05.560 --> 31:09.439
Don't look to me. I was born here.
I know what she's talking about.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.678
You've gotta believe it,
if she has to leave, it'll kill her.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.793
People don't die as easy as that.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.873
There's some people like that.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.236
We'll get her a nice house
with a radio, a modern kitchen.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.074
You don't know her.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.433
You love her, don't you?
And you're afraid of her.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.794
Not really.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.878
I think if anyone has a chance
of reaching her, it would be you.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.395
Was that your little girl?

31:57.560 --> 31:58.993
I have a little boy, too.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.232
One of those men
isn't your husband?

32:02.640 --> 32:03.914
My uncles.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.554
Where's your husband?

32:10.280 --> 32:11.633
I'm sorry.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.879
How long have you lived here
with here?

32:17.040 --> 32:18.439
Since my husband died.

32:20.680 --> 32:25.470
We lived on the other bank,
in a white house. Did you see it?

32:26.480 --> 32:27.879
Yes, I did. Yeah.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.553
Well, when he died,

32:34.520 --> 32:36.078
I just locked the door

32:37.280 --> 32:41.398
and took my two babies
and come over here to Granma.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.473
How old were you when he died?

32:44.840 --> 32:45.829
Nineteen.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.838
Nineteen?
And you have two children.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.237
I plain gave up.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.430
But Granma doesn't believe
in giving up.

32:56.920 --> 32:58.512
Yes, I kind of gathered that.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.990
She gave me her savings

33:03.200 --> 33:05.509
and sent me off to Jennings college

33:07.280 --> 33:08.474
to better myself.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.359
I tried it a whole year,
but I just couldn't concentrate.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.558
So I came back.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.756
And I've been here ever since.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.389
Certainly you have a fellow
somebody who cares.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.638
Yes, I've got a fellow.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.194
Well, then?

33:38.400 --> 33:39.833
What's that supposed to mean?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.431
If you do have a fellow...

33:43.640 --> 33:45.437
Yeah, a fellow solves everything.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.518
I gather you don't care
too much about him.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.034
I'm going to marry him.

33:53.720 --> 33:54.994
But you don't love him?

33:59.080 --> 34:00.354
My children...

34:01.440 --> 34:02.953
Everything is so confused,
I don't...

34:08.600 --> 34:10.556
I can't wait much longer,
he's getting impatient.

34:12.639 --> 34:16.268
If you don't love him,
I wouldn't marry him.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.353
You wouldn't?

34:25.440 --> 34:27.112
You're a real romantic,
aren't you?

34:32.840 --> 34:34.319
I'll walk you to the ferry.

34:36.679 --> 34:37.908
Come on.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.277
You can't let a tough break
ruin your whole life.

34:49.679 --> 34:50.954
I know you can't.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.879
Just like they say,

34:54.239 --> 34:56.800
you gotta snap out of it
and take an interest in things.

34:57.880 --> 34:58.995
I know you do.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.989
The most dangerous erosion
is not the land,

35:02.440 --> 35:04.749
but your capacity
for living.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.273
What you looking at, Sam?

35:13.760 --> 35:15.318
Just measuring, Miss Carol.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.594
The water won't rise until
they close the gates.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.879
How they get the electricity?

35:30.600 --> 35:35.469
Is it in the water all the time
or do they squeeze it out somehow?

35:36.800 --> 35:39.314
No, Sam, it's the fall of the water.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.389
The force of water
coming down the mountain.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.195
If you come down to the dam
I'll show you, okay?

35:47.560 --> 35:48.675
Yes, sir.

35:49.120 --> 35:54.069
What will you all do when the water
starts covering the island?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.551
-Let the white folks worry.
-We all gonna drown?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.556
Of course not,
but you've all got to get off.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.349
Who's gonna look after us?

36:03.720 --> 36:04.869
Who does that now?

36:05.320 --> 36:08.437
Mrs. Ella, she looks after us good.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.871
Wouldn't you rather
look after yourselves?

36:15.680 --> 36:16.829
I've got an idea.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.751
Can all of you come down
to the TVA office tomorrow?

36:20.960 --> 36:22.234
We can talk about it.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.758
Mrs. Ella won't like it.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.391
Think about it.
I'll be in there all morning.

36:36.040 --> 36:39.430
I want to thank you, Mrs...
I don't know your name.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.795
Carol.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.433
Okay, Carol.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.519
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

36:49.560 --> 36:50.754
Will it?

36:51.200 --> 36:53.077
Sure.
If we help a little.

36:53.760 --> 36:54.590
There we go!

37:12.920 --> 37:14.831
Do you mind if I come with you?

37:15.640 --> 37:16.834
No.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.714
Do you mind?

37:21.240 --> 37:22.468
Do you mind?

37:23.080 --> 37:24.399
No.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.711
I haven't talked to anyone
in so long.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.949
I know.

37:39.520 --> 37:43.069
The current will carry us
across. Slowly.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.434
Slowly.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.759
What's that song?

38:01.760 --> 38:03.318
It's just an old hymn.

38:07.640 --> 38:10.074
And he walks with me.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.396
And he tells me
I am his own.

38:16.200 --> 38:21.149
And the joy we share
as we tarry there,

38:22.480 --> 38:25.916
none other has ever known.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.758
I think it might work.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.355
What?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.319
What you was talking about.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.269
Come with me?
I want to show you something.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.915
Sure.

38:46.040 --> 38:47.314
Would you get me the key?

39:22.880 --> 39:24.393
Oh, my...

39:34.280 --> 39:35.998
You all right?

39:36.680 --> 39:37.829
I'm all right, thanks.

39:40.520 --> 39:41.714
This is...?

39:42.520 --> 39:44.511
is this the first time
you've been back?

39:46.200 --> 39:47.872
My, oh my.

40:06.680 --> 40:10.593
I had someone straighten up
a few weeks after, but since then...

41:39.680 --> 41:41.159
There's that river out there.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.114
Granma loves that river.

41:45.960 --> 41:50.909
Maybe she could come here,
sit here and look at it.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.316
How come you never suggested it?

41:56.040 --> 41:57.393
I just thought of it.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.397
You never thought of it before?

42:01.640 --> 42:03.312
I never thought I'd come back.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.549
You really loved your husband,
didn't you?

42:11.640 --> 42:12.914
Jim.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.199
Yeah.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.713
Yeah.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.637
Can I ask you something?

42:32.800 --> 42:34.711
When I told you
about Walter...

42:34.920 --> 42:35.909
About who?

42:36.120 --> 42:38.839
Walter Clark.
The man who wants to marry me.

42:40.440 --> 42:41.555
Yes?

42:43.280 --> 42:46.158
You said that I shouldn't

42:47.200 --> 42:49.236
marry him if I didn't love him.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.599
Yes, I said that,

42:54.440 --> 42:57.273
but as a sort of general rule.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.514
Is he a nice person?

43:01.000 --> 43:02.274
Yeah!

43:02.840 --> 43:04.193
Well...

43:05.000 --> 43:06.479
And I like him,

43:08.080 --> 43:09.399
but...

43:17.120 --> 43:21.591
Maybe I'd get to love him,
after I was married to him awhile.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.235
You think it ever
happens that way?

43:29.560 --> 43:30.675
No.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.391
If I married Walter, I could
come here and live with the children.

43:47.880 --> 43:51.429
And then,
maybe Granma come.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.754
But she won't, I know she won't,
she'll never leave that island.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.278
I don't know what to do.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.671
I don't, I don't.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.038
I just don't know.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.029
It's getting dark out.

44:43.640 --> 44:44.755
Don't go.

44:45.560 --> 44:46.879
Please don't go.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.589
Don't go.

45:35.720 --> 45:40.430
And he walks with me
and he talks with me,

45:41.640 --> 45:45.076
And he tells me I am his own.

45:46.280 --> 45:51.229
And the joy we share
and we tarry there

45:52.000 --> 45:55.834
none other has ever known.

45:58.640 --> 46:02.679
I don't understand. You're behind
on clearing the fields

46:02.880 --> 46:06.111
and yet, here you have
12 able-bodied men who want jobs.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.275
They want to work!

46:07.480 --> 46:09.038
-I also said...
-Tom.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.355
Not now, Jack.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.269
I also said that we can't hire
Negroes. The whites would quit.

46:16.760 --> 46:18.432
That's a chance we have to take.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.834
Let's go out back.

46:21.080 --> 46:24.311
You think if you take
all the Negroes off the island

46:24.520 --> 46:28.433
the old lady will be stranded
and will have to leave too?

46:29.000 --> 46:30.911
It might work out that way.

46:31.120 --> 46:35.511
You're heading into trouble with
the townsfolk. Our customs is...

46:35.720 --> 46:37.517
Look, this is TVA.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.715
We're new,
we don't have any customs yet.

46:42.160 --> 46:43.559
I'm going to hire those men

46:43.760 --> 46:47.196
and every man, black or white,
gets paid the same.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.234
Mr. Glover, I predict your next
visit will be from Mr. Moore.

46:51.720 --> 46:54.473
We'd like a few words.
My name's Sy Moore.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.149
Mr. Moore...

47:01.160 --> 47:03.754
Come on in.
What can I do for you?

47:03.960 --> 47:07.270
Thank you. Now Mr. Glover,
we've come here to help you.

47:07.680 --> 47:10.353
-Mr. Todd is President of our bank.
-Just fine.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.352
And Mr. Thompson,
he's our undertaker,

47:12.560 --> 47:15.393
also runs a furniture store,
very highly respected.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.198
I'm just a plain business man.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.993
Won't you sit down?

47:20.920 --> 47:23.753
I tell you this so you'll know
who you're talking with.

47:24.480 --> 47:27.711
You might say we're the responsibles
of the town.

47:28.160 --> 47:31.550
I see and you're here
to tell me that

47:32.960 --> 47:37.909
if I hire Negroes
the whites will quit, is that it?

47:38.440 --> 47:41.273
Why, not at all.
What makes you think that?

47:43.120 --> 47:43.996
Sorry.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.156
Just have to keep them
in separate gangs.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.669
Keeping them...

47:47.880 --> 47:49.393
In separate gangs.

47:53.920 --> 47:56.639
All right. I will do that.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.272
We were sure you would.

47:59.560 --> 48:01.869
Now Mr. Glover,
how much you planning to pay them?

48:02.520 --> 48:04.670
You're not planning
to pay them the same as the whites?

48:05.480 --> 48:06.754
The jobs are the same.

48:06.960 --> 48:10.032
-You look like a reasonable man.
-You do.

48:10.240 --> 48:13.118
So just think,
after this project is over

48:13.320 --> 48:15.959
we can't go on paying them
as much as the white man.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.276
Would ruin our whole economy.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.838
The Federal Government
can't make such distinctions.

48:23.520 --> 48:26.910
Still, we prefer that you pay
their usual wage.

48:27.320 --> 48:28.594
How much do the whites get?

48:29.280 --> 48:30.190
Five dollars a day.

48:30.920 --> 48:34.390
You surely don't intend to pay
these darkies five dollars?

48:34.720 --> 48:37.109
I'll go out myself
for five dollars a day.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.750
I'll get you the biggest,
strongest

48:39.960 --> 48:42.633
best-looking bucks in this country
for two dollars a day.

48:43.520 --> 48:46.318
We're all for the TVA
and we want to help you,

48:46.520 --> 48:50.832
so if you'll cooperate on this point,
everything will be just fine.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.472
If I don't go along with you?

48:58.720 --> 49:01.393
As I said, we're the responsibles
of this town, but...

49:01.600 --> 49:03.716
-There are other type of men here.
-Yes there are.

49:03.920 --> 49:07.196
Men who aren't so responsible.
We can control them only to a point.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.676
-Bailey's a good example.
-He runs the gas station.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.235
He's a very good boy
and he wanted to come too.

49:12.440 --> 49:15.113
In which case the conversation
would've been different.

49:15.440 --> 49:18.876
We said to Bailey,
"Let's go over and talk to him."

49:19.080 --> 49:21.196
-"Give him a chance".
-And that was all right with him.

49:21.400 --> 49:22.992
We made it all right with him.

49:23.320 --> 49:26.676
-We want to help you, but Bailey...
-Hard boy to reason with.

49:26.880 --> 49:27.995
Yes. he is.

49:28.240 --> 49:29.992
And there's a whole lot
like him in this town.

49:31.160 --> 49:32.275
Really.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.795
We want you to know
how we feel about it.

49:40.160 --> 49:44.472
I understand your feeling.
I'd like to think it over.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.916
Betty,
would you ask them to come in?

49:59.240 --> 50:00.514
You all come on in.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.115
I'll be right with you.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.389
Hi, Sam.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.434
Here we are, boys.

50:33.400 --> 50:37.234
Jerry, this ought to do
for you and your family,

50:37.440 --> 50:39.908
until you find something
of your own.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.514
Boy, oh boy,
who ever thought of that?

51:06.880 --> 51:09.633
Yes, sir. We'd have trouble
coming through mud tonight.

51:09.880 --> 51:10.995
I'll say.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.277
Goodnight,
I'll see you in the morning.

51:36.840 --> 51:37.989
I've got them all jobs.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.556
They're leaving the island
in the morning.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.635
Carol.

51:53.880 --> 51:57.236
It's beautiful here
when it rains too.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.839
No wonder she doesn't want to leave.

52:01.600 --> 52:02.794
You're shivering.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.712
It's October.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.118
I hate to see the summer go.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.672
Look at the leaves falling.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.915
Chuck.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.190
Don't, don't, don't.

52:36.960 --> 52:39.758
I don't want to kid myself
or you.

52:43.640 --> 52:46.473
I believe maybe
I'm in love with you.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.631
I didn't think I'd ever
fall in love again.

52:52.800 --> 52:57.078
Soon this business will be over
and you'll be leaving.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.631
I've got to protect myself, Chuck.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.151
I feel like living again now,

53:07.400 --> 53:08.799
but I don't want to be
hurt any more.

53:12.360 --> 53:13.679
Not by anybody.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.669
Yes.

53:19.240 --> 53:20.593
Do you want to come in?

53:23.360 --> 53:25.828
I've been working here all day,
and you know what?

53:26.120 --> 53:28.793
I'm going to paint every room
a different colour. Look.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.559
That's all Jim's stuff.

53:32.920 --> 53:34.273
Some boots

53:34.920 --> 53:37.115
and that old shotgun.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.519
I don't know what to do with it.

53:50.360 --> 53:53.955
Look, Chuck. Look at
this sweater Granma knit.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.918
It looks like something she'd do.

53:59.200 --> 54:02.431
Stop walking around
in front of me, would you?

54:02.640 --> 54:04.039
Don't walk in front of me.

54:07.240 --> 54:08.355
I'm sorry.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.479
I'd like a drink.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.154
I'll look.

54:49.840 --> 54:53.515
What's the matter?
Stay still.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.834
Don't.

55:09.480 --> 55:10.799
Don't.

55:33.160 --> 55:34.354
I'm gonna go.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.038
Carol,

57:35.400 --> 57:38.756
did you know about this?

57:43.480 --> 57:44.435
I had hints.

57:44.640 --> 57:46.073
Hints?

57:52.000 --> 57:54.594
Carol, you remember
that yellow cat we had?

57:56.800 --> 58:01.271
Come her season,
we used to let her out at night.

58:02.240 --> 58:04.390
It was dawn when she'd come back.

58:07.840 --> 58:11.628
Now a cat is really quiet,

58:13.560 --> 58:16.358
but I could hear her at dawn,

58:17.360 --> 58:19.351
sneaking back into the house.

58:21.920 --> 58:23.035
I know I done wrong.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.590
I done wrong. I know it.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.917
How long has Jim been dead now?

58:33.160 --> 58:34.275
Three years.

58:34.560 --> 58:36.232
That's a long time.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.514
I remember when I was young.

58:41.640 --> 58:43.232
That's a long time.

58:45.200 --> 58:49.113
But I just can't understand
going over to the enemy.

58:49.360 --> 58:51.271
He's right,
you can't stay here any longer.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.517
Stop looking at me that way.
People say you're crazy.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.109
I've fixed my house.
We can take the children.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.469
We can't stay here any longer.

58:58.680 --> 59:00.033
Well, you better go too.

59:00.480 --> 59:02.198
I want you to go!
Tonight!

59:02.760 --> 59:03.988
Go!

59:08.840 --> 59:10.990
All right, I'll go,
but I'm not going far.

59:11.200 --> 59:14.590
I'm going over to my house
and I'm going to wait for you.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.233
Jim Junior, Barbara Ann!

59:22.240 --> 59:23.832
Why are you sitting there?

59:25.680 --> 59:26.999
Just resting.

59:28.320 --> 59:30.629
Well, rest and then get going.

59:32.480 --> 59:35.040
I've changed my mind.
I ain't going.

59:40.960 --> 59:42.109
Get up.

59:44.120 --> 59:45.348
Get up!

59:49.840 --> 59:53.833
Never did have no brains,
did you, Sam?

59:56.360 --> 59:57.793
Don't you know what's coming?

59:58.720 --> 59:59.948
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.391
You get going, Sam.
I want you to go.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.828
I ain't going.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.473
The ferry pole.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.239
Granma.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.997
We better go get some groceries.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.520
Eight gallons at 18.
1.44 dollars.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.673
Bailey, how's Alice?

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.311
Why, Carol, she's just fine.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.912
Do you two know each other?
R.J. Bailey, Chuck Glover.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.309
You're Bailey?

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.952
R.J. Bailey.
No, I haven't had the pleasure.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.948
I'm happy to meet you.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.352
That's a nice ready-made family
you've got, Mr. Glouver.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.908
Glover.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.992
-Did I read that right? Carol Garth?
-I saw her, too.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.236
You think Walter knows
somebody's getting in his nest?

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.398
-I heard he knew about it.
-What do you expect he'll do?

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.029
He's so scared of what Carol thinks
of him he might not do anything.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.916
He might appreciate a little help
in the situation.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.271
As for those jobs,
that gentleman is handing out...

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.439
We had a hard day.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.911
Give him his supper
and put him to bed.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.279
What's the matter?
Afraid you're getting in too deep?

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.753
I don't want you to marry me.
Do you feel better?

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.032
That is it.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.593
I understand how you men
have to watch every step.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.190
You can't be caught saying
anything permanent sounding.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.557
I'm not out to tie you down.
You don't have to say you love me.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.751
Now will you come in?

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.512
It's just that I've been taking
a good look at myself...

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.280
And you decided that
you're not the marrying type.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.635
No, no, it's not...

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.479
You've got so much to do
before you settle down.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.318
Don't, please.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.953
Besides...

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.794
let's tell the truth.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.195
We're different people,
aren't we?

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.468
You're... I don't know.
Everything different.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.751
Do you ever need anybody?

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.633
Shut up.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.635
Come here.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.039
Don't.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.389
Chuck...

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.753
The children.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.315
Hold still, hold still.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.915
Anyway now it's wonderful.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.431
You can't get enough of me right now,
can you? Tell me!

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.990
I can't get enough of you.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.198
Let's put the kids to bed.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.592
Let's put the kids to bed.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.873
Jim Junior. Wake up, honey.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.315
Hi, Jimmy.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.678
Little rabbit,
little white rabbit...

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.591
Wake up.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.198
Chuck, will you carry me in?

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.629
Yes.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.989
Jimmy!

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.638
You love me, don't you?

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.039
Walter,
what are you doing here?

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.199
I came to help you clean up.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.630
Aren't you going to introduce me
to Mr. Glover?

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.553
I'm Walter Clark.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.150
I brought in some eggs, milk,
bread and coffee for breakfast.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.395
You didn't have anything.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.238
Oh, we...

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.318
You see, Mr. Glover,
she doesn't even thank me.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.635
but it's natural to take care
of the girl one is courting.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.239
Get those kids to bed.
They look tired.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.759
They slept in the car.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.678
They look tired.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.110
Will you sleep with me, Chuck?

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.392
You going back to town?

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.799
Yes.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.273
Would you drive me in?
I'll leave my car here for her.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.839
Do you mind?

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.589
No, not at all.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.754
Well, say goodbye
and let's go.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.475
Goodnight.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.674
Goodnight.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.511
You rest too, Carol.
You look tired.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.395
Once this Garth business is over,
will you be leaving here?

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.236
It ought to be over pretty soon,
oughtn't it?

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.913
It has to be.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.433
That's right.
It has to be.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.356
You just drive me to your hotel.
I'll walk from there.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.752
You do have my thought by now?

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.194
I have your thought.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.677
You eat your cereal.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.835
Well...

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.838
Which did you say
your room was?

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.872
I didn't say,
but it's next to the end.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.513
You left your light on.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.031
Goodnight.
And I want to pay you a compliment.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.912
Carol could do worse.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.279
Tonight,
we open the jolly festivities,

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.200
by singing the praises
of dear old Redville".

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.033
What's the matter?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.149
Don't go up there.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.995
How many are there?

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.839
Just one.
He wants to see you...

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.314
Go on home.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.314
BELL

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:33.508
Turn on the light.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.792
There's only one of you.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.874
I didn't figure I needed
anyone else.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.835
What do you want?

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.270
Remember my name, R.J. Bailey,
I run that gas station.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.595
Yeah, I remember.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.590
I also work 400 acres of cotton
just outside of town.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.750
I'd have visited you sooner,
but we're harvesting.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.837
Yesterday one of my best hands,
Ben, a real nice boy,

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.715
ran off and joined your workers.
Five dollars a day.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.435
When I heard about it,
I went into the house and got a stick

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.069
about so long
and about that thick,

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.277
and I went to where he was working.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.833
I didn't get out of the car,
I didn't want to shame him,

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.113
I said to him,
"Ben, get in the car."

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.276
When we got home, I took him
into the barn and beat him.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.918
He's all right now. I mean,
he's thinking is all right now.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.034
He couldn't work yesterday
or today.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.830
Had to hire another boy
to do his job for two days.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.755
So I figure you owe me
what I had to pay that extra.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.592
Two times two dollars a day,
four dollars.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.511
Yeah, Mr. Glover,
you owe me four dollars.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.399
I don't see it that way.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.911
You need some time
to think it over.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.799
I don't need it.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.434
You think it over.
Do you want one?

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.472
You see, Mr. Glover,

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.110
if you keep stealing our best field
hands at five dollars,

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.596
you're gonna be dealing
with my friends too.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.872
What's keeping you here?

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.718
They tell me you're here to get
an old woman off an island.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.112
There's nothing to that.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.356
I'll go and get her off tomorrow.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.755
I'll go down and pack her up.
Wouldn't you like me to?

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.038
I want you to mind
your own business.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.108
I figured since you've been
mixing in mine,

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.233
that you wouldn't mind
if just I mixed in yours.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.956
But you're like me, Mr. Glover.
You do mind.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.514
Well, how about it?
Four dollars?

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.835
No.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.119
If you don't give it to me,
I'm going to take it away from you.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.315
You may have some trouble.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.789
Oh, man...

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.668
Good night, Sully.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.518
Was you there, Charlie?

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.314
Then the air was full
of hamburger meat.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.109
Our friend in Number 3
needs change for this ten.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.514
I think I have it.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.353
I think you'll get
your girl all right, Walter.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.074
And I think our friend upstairs
will be leaving town soon.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.393
This is his change.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.191
Take my four dollars and send him
the best liquor you can find.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.275
He needs it.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.671
Okay, I am stubborn,
but I can't get it out of my head

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.997
that there isn't some way
to reach that old woman.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.759
After all, people are human,
I mean, people are human.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.712
I don't know if Ella Garth is.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.232
I don't care what you call her.
She was born, she'll die, won't she?

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.594
Mrs. Garth!

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.116
Mrs. Garth!

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.559
Mrs. Garth!

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.875
Who's there?

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.797
It's me, Chuck Glover.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.399
Who's that with you?

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.589
That's my friend, Walter Clark.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.910
You've been drinking
that corn liquor, ain't you?

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.714
I acknowledge, I had a drink.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.076
It seems to me
you can hardly stand up.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.354
Mrs. Garth, we've come here

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.834
we want to talk to you
as one human being to another.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.954
Walter.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.432
You better take this lunatic home.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.679
I'll take him home in a minute,
but I want to say something.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.791
I understand you, Mrs. Garth.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.159
I know exactly
what you're fighting for.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.797
It's your dignity.
I know!

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.555
I'm right?

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.031
It's your everlasting,
ever loving dignity.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.714
It's your dignity.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.151
That's it, it's your dignity.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.029
He's...

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.677
Well, he sure is.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.708
He looks smaller
than I thought.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.199
That's right.
They're closing that dam Monday.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.836
You got two weeks
to get that island levelled.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.272
We haven't got the old lady
off yet.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.679
Have the U.S. Marshal put her off
as soon as you can.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.757
-Or sooner.
-Clear the land!

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.679
But what about the bad publicity?

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.559
There'll be worse publicity
if she gets wet!

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.594
Yeah.
I'll get to it right away.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.072
Another cup of coffee?

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.230
Mr. Glover!

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.155
It's about Ma.

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.751
This here is Mr. Armstrong,
our lawyer.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.589
We feel that Mrs. Garth is
no longer fit to handle her affairs.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.872
We'll declare her senile
and sell the property ourselves.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.798
You said yourself
she was incompetent.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.992
Anybody that stays when
the water is rising, must be crazy.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.119
-The rest of us done got off.
-And Joe John and Mattie.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.675
Under the law we can
have her declared incompetent.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.156
I'd rather have her put off
at gun point.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.351
I'll have the papers ready
in the morning.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.670
I've known her since I was a boy.
I hate to do this.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.635
You hate to do it?

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.674
It all goes under the general
heading of progress.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.793
Yeah, that's what they say.

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.278
Heard you had trouble last night.
Any complaints?

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.914
All goes under the general
heading of progress.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.909
Mrs. Garth?

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.951
I apologise for the other night.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.076
First and only time
I ever liked you.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.549
Mrs. Garth, Hamilton y Cal
came to my office with a lawyer.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.111
They'll prove you're of unsound mind

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.437
and unable to negotiate
the sale of your property.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.834
Worthless!

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:20.796
Can you hear me?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.752
They was always worthless!

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.351
If they can prove it
they can sell your land.

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:32.233
This whole island
will be flooded in two weeks.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.716
This house is coming down!

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.275
You can't stay here any longer!

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.874
Are you listening?

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.519
Marshal Hogue has issued
an order for your eviction

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.877
and tomorrow it'll be executed.
Come with me now.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.315
Mrs. Garth.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.919
What are you trying to prove?

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.032
Sam, all this is going to be
under water.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:52.995
I said a house with a porch.
It's got to have a porch.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.279
So keep trying, will you?

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.878
When other helpers fail

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.989
and comfort flees,

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.716
Help of the helpless,

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.391
oh, abide with.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.878
Jimmy learned a new one.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:18.956
Sing it for me.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.317
Jesus loves me,

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.353
this is know.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.433
For the Bib...

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.589
Hi.

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:35.956
Hello, Chuck!

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.752
How is it?

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.839
Okay.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.838
You look tired.
What you been doing all day?

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.111
Looking for a house with a porch.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.230
Good night, Chuck.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.555
Good night.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.037
Frances, just put them down for me.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.398
Get to bed, honey.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.236
When I first came down here
I thought,

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.870
"How can one person go against
what's happening in the country?"

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.790
There she's been, sitting there
for 80 years

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.715
and I was going to get her off
in one day.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.628
I was even looking forward to it.
Imagine.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.318
And now, I have to make sure
I get her off alive.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.633
Goodnight, honey.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.515
Goodnight.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.392
You're becoming human,
aren't you?

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.550
I was always human, wasn't I?

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.874
Then you'll be leaving soon.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.993
Not for a couple of weeks
at least.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.953
I have to wait until the land
is cleared first,

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.199
and stuff like that.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.510
A couple of weeks?

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.630
Maybe more,
maybe a little longer.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.433
A little longer.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.796
I'm going now, Mrs. Carol.

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.277
Good night, Frances.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.113
Good night, Frances.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.389
Here you are.

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.835
Chuck.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.589
Yes, dear?

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.874
I hate to say this.

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.349
Say what?

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.192
Something I hate to say.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.515
What?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.789
When you go,

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.559
take me with you.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.117
One day soon,
you're going to come to me

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.549
and you're gonna say,

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.753
"Carol, I have to go."

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.712
And there won't be time to talk,
or to think, or anything.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.715
And there'll be a car waiting,
and then a plane

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.996
and you'll say,
"Carol, honey, I have to go."

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.514
Isn't that right?

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.188
Yes, that's right.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.474
Take me with you.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.989
Did I tell you what happened
after you left with Walter?

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.232
No.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.235
He came back here
at the middle of the night

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.150
and he nearly broke my heart.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.554
How?

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.589
I kept saying to him,
"Stop looking at me.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.872
I have nothing to give any man.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.512
Except if I love him."

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.069
He kept saying,

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.070
"He'll leave you
after his job's done,

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.117
but I'm forever.
I'm forever."

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.196
He's right.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.592
I wish you hadn't said that.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.072
Why did you say that?

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.755
I know it's true,
but why?

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.194
I know it's true.

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.468
I know.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.508
I'm leaving here,

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.914
with or without you,
but I want you to know something.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.154
I'd be a good wife for you.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.632
A damn good wife.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.197
I'm smart in some ways
and I know what's good about you

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.516
and what's bad
and I'm not afraid to tell you.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.911
I have two children who love you.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.558
They love you and I love you.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.119
And you're not easy to love,

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.072
but you do need someone.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.834
And I love you.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.517
I love you.

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.999
It's stopped raining.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.509
Don't say anything.
Don't.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.558
I'm afraid of what you might say.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.755
I don't know what to say.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.353
God, that says it all.

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.314
That's not what I meant.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:58.749
It's what you really meant.
It's what you are thinking.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.877
I heard you.
I asked you and you said "no."

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.314
I heard you.

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.835
Chuck.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.789
Anything.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.068
What do you want from me?

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.751
I'll do anything.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.919
I'm sorry to break in here.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:33.836
I told you...

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.519
I owe it to him.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.359
Carol!
What is it?

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.229
There are men coming.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.632
Silence.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.350
Turn off those lights.
Alden, give me that rifle.

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.874
(Barnyard like sounds)

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.992
-Whose truck is this, Buddy?
-Walter Clark.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.394
Get out.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.833
I don't know what's happening.

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:23.712
Mama!

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.672
I'm in here, honey.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.192
I'd better pull down that shade.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:36.796
Walter.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.912
What happened?
Are you all right?

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.076
Chuck! It's your old buddy,
Bailey!

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.472
I've brought my friends along!

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.398
Got you all packed!

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.514
What are they doing with my car?

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.312
Excuse me, Barbara.
Don't you dare go out there.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.875
Got your ticket bought
all the way to Washington!

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.756
Got you a travelling mate.
How'd you like to go to Washington?

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.471
-What do you think?
-They're just having fun.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.719
Mommy! Mommy!

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.189
You go...

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:39.556
Did you see that?

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.589
What are you doing in my pickup!
Get out of it!

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.598
Bailey, you damaged my house
and you're paying for it!

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.872
-Time to go, Mr. Glover!
-Bailey, you shot at me.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.911
-I shot at the lamp.
-You shot at me!

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:57.238
-Well, Mr. Glover.
-Sure is nice to meet you.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:01.992
-Sure has been fitting to meet you.
-When are you going home?

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.077
-How's Eleanor up there.
-Who's Eleanor?

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.872
Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.316
My pickup. You did!

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.428
I'll see you to the train.

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.709
Glover!

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.629
Watch it, Chuck.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:21.829
Bailey.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.752
There's no way to scare me out.

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.511
I came down here to do a job and...

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.189
Carol!

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.879
Muss him up!

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.668
What that matter with you?
What are you doing?

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.556
No, no don't.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.273
Let me go.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.635
-Do you know what you just did?
-Don't hit a woman.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.115
I don't want a word out of you.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.478
Time to go beddy-bye.

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.990
You just smacked a woman
right on the ground.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.433
Don't hit a woman.
Don't hit a woman.

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:11.791
Who else is gonna say a word?
Go on, another word.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.230
I want to hear another word
out of someone!

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:15.999
Just say one word.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.677
-Sheriff.
-How you getting along?

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.918
All right, I guess.
A little tired.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.911
Why don't you all go on home?

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.956
Anything I can do for you,
Mrs. Carol?

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.071
Get off my place now.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.955
You know...

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.117
I wish some day I could win
maybe one fight.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.753
You were wonderful up there.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.796
I don't care if you ever win
a fight.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.796
Marry me?

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.913
I know I'll probably
regret it.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.674
I'm sure you'll regret it,
but...

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.077
Get your hat, get a coat,
wash up. All right?

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:58.435
All right.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.911
"And now, by the authority invested
in me by the State of Tennessee

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:14.159
as a Justice of Peace,
I pronounce you man and wife.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.352
What God has joined together
let no man put asunder."

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.038
Five dollars, please.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.558
Five dollars, please.

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:25.909
Anyway, it's got a porch.
I hope she likes it.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:43.230
"You have refused to vacate
said property you are therefore,

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:47.508
hereby commanded to immediately
and forthwith vacate

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.839
the real estate, buildings,
outbuildings,

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.157
and the premises, designated
as Tract 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 7,

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.598
and this you'll in nowise fail
to do under the penalty of the law.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.189
Signed, Allan R. Nealy,
District judge."

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.238
That's it.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.116
What are you waiting for?

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.873
There she goes!

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.919
Well, this is it.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.229
Granma, you look kind of tired.

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.511
Don't you want to go in
and lie down?

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.356
Carol.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.834
Yes, Granma.

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.634
I owe Frank Zachary

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.713
16 cents
for two pounds of sugar.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.312
You see that he gets it

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.831
next time you go in.

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.075
Yes, Granma.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.436
That's all I owe.

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.513
Anybody.

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.509
Chuck!

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.072
Well, here she goes.

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.992
Granma just died.

01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.392
You had it to do. There was
nothing else you could've done.

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.912
It looks like we're ready to go.

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.875
Go ahead.

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:11.509
Yeah.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.758
Okay, go ahead!

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.397
"Truly, truly, I say to you

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.718
she who believeth
hath life eternal."

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:58.759
(Song)

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.079
Barbara Ann!
