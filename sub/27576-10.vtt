55 seconds.

00:13.670 --> 00:15.990
And that's your fastest time of the day,
folks.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.060
Georgie, what is it?

00:19.418 --> 00:20.389
Georgie!

00:20.410 --> 00:22.218
And thanks again for
taking him this weekend,

00:22.250 --> 00:23.754
it looks like you made some progress.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.070
I know he's hiding something.

00:25.110 --> 00:27.310
I just need a bit more time
to get to the bottom of it.

00:27.434 --> 00:28.821
Okay, it's a song.

00:28.853 --> 00:30.784
It's my ex's birthday coming up,

00:30.848 --> 00:31.717
and I'm stuck on the hook.

00:31.728 --> 00:33.301
I wonder if you could
just take a look at it,

00:33.312 --> 00:34.240
and make it good?

00:34.266 --> 00:36.805
- Sure, I'll have a look at it.
- Thank you, buddy.

00:36.816 --> 00:37.880
It's good to see you.

00:57.870 --> 00:59.509
Are you sure you're up for this?

00:59.562 --> 01:01.240
Are you feeling okay?

01:01.408 --> 01:02.869
I'm-I'm fine.

01:03.459 --> 01:05.569
Really,
I wish people would stop asking me that.

01:05.701 --> 01:08.110
It's great that you wanna help, but I...

01:08.298 --> 01:10.005
I really don't need any.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.200
Okay, you're gonna have fun doing this.

01:20.693 --> 01:21.584
Yeah.

01:21.890 --> 01:24.848
Yeah,
I used a bit of feather from a pheasant,

01:24.940 --> 01:29.189
to make this fly look like a tiny wing.

01:29.424 --> 01:31.290
Because that's what fish like.

01:31.312 --> 01:35.605
They think this is
something real tasty to eat.

01:35.910 --> 01:37.616
When I go fishing next week

01:37.642 --> 01:39.696
with my old friend, Will Vernon,

01:39.738 --> 01:42.405
this new fly is gonna be the reason

01:42.453 --> 01:46.000
that I catch more fish than he does.

01:46.820 --> 01:48.490
Hey!

01:48.741 --> 01:51.730
Hey! It's your favourite Grandpa.

01:51.962 --> 01:53.925
What are you doing, having a tea party?

01:54.550 --> 01:55.989
Good. Hey!

01:56.037 --> 01:57.962
Lou tells me that you're
going up to the fishing cabin.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.506
- You want some company?
- I've already got company.

02:00.522 --> 02:03.168
What's with that RV of
yours suddenly appearing

02:03.189 --> 02:05.140
at the end of the driveway? My driveway!

02:05.146 --> 02:07.269
Well, Stumpy leased out that
land to another rancher.

02:07.296 --> 02:09.018
- So I had to move it out.
- Yeah well,

02:09.044 --> 02:11.173
you better not think that
you can leave it there.

02:11.178 --> 02:13.744
You should be happy
that I bought that RV.

02:13.781 --> 02:16.160
'Cause we can travel anywhere.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.066
Like the fishing cabin.
Plus, air conditioning,

02:19.088 --> 02:21.605
fridge, microwave, surround sound.

02:21.674 --> 02:22.970
Sleeps six.

02:22.997 --> 02:25.792
I mean, it's way better than
that crap cabin you stay in.

02:25.882 --> 02:26.554
Think about it.

02:26.586 --> 02:29.160
There is nothing to think about,
believe me.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.930
- Don't touch that! Ah!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

02:31.962 --> 02:33.970
I-I got it Jack, I got it.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.500
- You make me crazy!
- My fault.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.496
Okay, they all came out.

02:41.390 --> 02:43.418
G.G. needs a nap, huh?

02:43.440 --> 02:44.330
Yeah.

03:10.070 --> 03:13.040
Jack. Oh my goodness!

03:13.422 --> 03:14.992
You probably don't recognize me.

03:15.002 --> 03:17.914
Oh, on the contrary, Doreen Vernon.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.557
Will's better half.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.170
It's good to see you.

03:25.230 --> 03:27.397
It's good to see you.

03:28.693 --> 03:30.260
Jack, I um...

03:32.520 --> 03:33.525
well, here.

03:33.552 --> 03:34.752
I have something.

03:44.410 --> 03:46.469
That is Will's guitar.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.232
He's gone, Jack.

03:52.044 --> 03:54.654
Our dear Will passed away.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.626
You make it look so easy.

04:57.690 --> 05:00.210
- And you will, too.
- How?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.645
You already have a
great bond with Phoenix.

05:02.698 --> 05:04.698
Well, we'll just build on that.

05:06.357 --> 05:07.568
Okay.

05:22.340 --> 05:23.570
There you go!

05:23.760 --> 05:26.405
I just, I feel really awkward.

05:30.976 --> 05:32.846
See? He's bored with me already.

05:32.912 --> 05:35.632
Come on Georgie, these things take time.

05:35.648 --> 05:37.818
You have to give it a chance.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.168
I just...

05:39.651 --> 05:41.721
I just don't really
feel like it right now.

05:41.749 --> 05:43.720
Well, I think you need to relax.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.333
You've already proven yourself.

05:45.349 --> 05:46.810
You have a ticket to go to Europe

05:46.816 --> 05:48.128
if that's what you wanna do.

05:48.170 --> 05:50.117
That's the last thing
I wanna think about.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.424
Okay, fine!

05:51.456 --> 05:53.669
But you do need to take a step back.

05:53.749 --> 05:57.093
A big one,
to a place where there's no competition.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.085
Right.

06:03.675 --> 06:05.615
Hey, Grandpa, can I call you back?

06:09.850 --> 06:11.482
Yeah, we'll be right there.

06:13.477 --> 06:15.037
We have to go home.

06:15.066 --> 06:16.362
Come on.

06:20.260 --> 06:22.860
Will always wanted you
to have his guitar.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.830
If anything happened.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.040
I'm honoured to have it.

06:27.490 --> 06:29.466
You know, I was always afraid

06:29.530 --> 06:32.138
that Will would end up a total recluse.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.000
But that man...

06:34.873 --> 06:37.673
he really changed these
past couple of years.

06:38.710 --> 06:40.901
He even swallowed his pride,

06:41.340 --> 06:44.778
and came courting me
after all our time apart.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.858
From what Will said, I guess...

06:49.560 --> 06:51.488
I have you to thank for that, Jack.

06:51.568 --> 06:55.125
Well, Will never did anything
he didn't want to do, so...

06:56.228 --> 06:59.788
do you have any funeral plans?

07:00.128 --> 07:03.632
No. Will didn't want any
of that kind of thing.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.362
It was always his wish
that his ashes be scattered

07:06.373 --> 07:09.170
on the land where his wild horses are.

07:10.033 --> 07:12.493
You all know how much he loved them.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.602
And that's where he
was when he went down.

07:19.835 --> 07:23.345
By the fence, watching his horses.

07:25.402 --> 07:27.952
He never forgot what
you did for that herd.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.184
Saving them from the cull like that.

07:33.170 --> 07:36.810
I'm sure grateful that
you came all this way

07:37.140 --> 07:40.336
to give me this news in person, Doreen.

07:40.810 --> 07:43.573
Oh, I couldn'tve told you any other way,
Jack.

07:43.860 --> 07:46.762
I mean, after all,
you and your wife, Lyndy,

07:46.768 --> 07:50.000
were the ones who introduced
me to Will in the first place.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.328
I thought he was the
craziest man I'd ever met.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.168
It turns out I was right, he was.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.066
But he was also a hopeless romantic.

08:03.237 --> 08:05.002
That song you helped him with?

08:05.130 --> 08:07.970
He serenaded me with
it on my last birthday.

08:08.186 --> 08:09.536
I really loved it.

08:11.370 --> 08:12.890
So I just...

08:17.340 --> 08:19.434
I wanna thank you, Jack.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.850
For giving me my Will not once,

08:24.890 --> 08:27.390
but twice in my lifetime.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.320
- So take care of yourself, now.
- Oh, you, too.

08:47.510 --> 08:49.110
Bye.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.460
Oh, Clint and Luke are on their way.

09:02.666 --> 09:05.594
- Do you want me to cancel?
- No, we promised.

09:05.730 --> 09:07.290
- Want some?
- I'm okay, thanks.

09:07.330 --> 09:08.522
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

09:08.522 --> 09:09.317
- Morning.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

09:09.317 --> 09:10.300
- Morning.
- Hey.

09:11.488 --> 09:14.318
Ha ha, Mitch's wedding invite.

09:14.352 --> 09:15.840
I got one of these too.

09:15.898 --> 09:17.589
I think I'll be taking a pass on that.

09:17.616 --> 09:18.840
Is anybody gonna go?

09:18.870 --> 09:21.616
Yeah, Ty and I are going,
and I think Grandpa is, too.

09:21.642 --> 09:23.456
Ugh. Weddings and funerals.

09:23.477 --> 09:25.914
That's pretty much life in a nutshell,
isn't it?

09:25.952 --> 09:29.701
Okay... I had a date to go fishing

09:29.722 --> 09:31.280
with Will Vernon,

09:31.470 --> 09:33.482
and by way of honouring my old friend,

09:33.498 --> 09:35.520
I'm sticking to the plan.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.306
I'll be at the cabin.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.605
I really don't think it's
a good idea for Grandpa

09:43.626 --> 09:45.200
to go up there alone right now.

09:45.230 --> 09:46.570
Maybe it'll be good for him.

09:46.677 --> 09:49.029
Amy, it'll give him some
time to process everything.

09:49.093 --> 09:51.450
I'll go with the old man,
he shouldn't be alone.

09:53.540 --> 09:56.117
I'm not asking for
anyone's permission here.

09:56.165 --> 09:57.940
I'm going. Alone.

09:59.402 --> 10:00.581
Hope you all understand.

10:00.592 --> 10:03.562
Grandpa, just don't spend
too long up there, okay?

10:03.589 --> 10:05.237
And drive safe.

10:05.710 --> 10:06.752
See you, Jack.

10:08.750 --> 10:09.893
Well, I've gotta get some paperwork done

10:09.904 --> 10:12.298
- before Luke and Clint show up.
- Yeah, I'll come help you.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.590
Okay, thank you. You got her?

10:15.973 --> 10:17.498
- All right.
- Thank you, Lou.

10:17.530 --> 10:18.378
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay, have a good one.

10:18.394 --> 10:19.952
- Sorry about the mess.
- Bye, guys.

10:39.317 --> 10:41.845
"Sometimes when you
sleep I watch you dream,

10:41.861 --> 10:43.301
and I dream, too.

10:43.580 --> 10:46.133
Someday your eyes will be
filled with a joy so deep

10:46.144 --> 10:47.590
that they shine.

10:47.793 --> 10:50.963
Someday you will hear something so sad

10:51.090 --> 10:53.130
that you will fold up with sorrow.

10:53.237 --> 10:56.597
Someday you will call
a song to the wind,

10:57.180 --> 10:59.834
and the wind will carry your song away."

11:04.560 --> 11:05.936
You okay, Amy?

11:12.320 --> 11:14.325
If it hadn't have been for Will,

11:14.530 --> 11:16.533
and our time at Pike River,

11:16.576 --> 11:18.597
we never would've gotten back together.

11:18.650 --> 11:21.493
We never... would've been married,

11:21.520 --> 11:23.000
had Lyndy.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.430
I know.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.530
I thought of that, too.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.840
I just can't believe that he's gone.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.074
Well, you couldn't ask for a better guy

11:36.096 --> 11:37.584
to help you with your project, Luke.

11:37.610 --> 11:39.328
Ty here is a mechanical wizard.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.552
Well, I wouldn't go that far, but...

11:41.621 --> 11:43.650
why don't you tell me about
what your project's about?

11:43.680 --> 11:45.696
It's for my STEM class.

11:46.601 --> 11:48.631
Uh, STEM class? Okay.

11:48.704 --> 11:51.269
Science, technology...

11:52.149 --> 11:53.649
Engineering and math.

11:53.717 --> 11:56.112
Okay well,
what'd you want to do for your project?

11:56.154 --> 11:59.109
I saw this picture of a
battery-operated truck.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.165
It was cool.

12:00.323 --> 12:02.623
And I brought some
parts that might work?

12:02.634 --> 12:03.786
I'd be happy to help you out, Luke,

12:03.808 --> 12:05.696
if that's what you wanna do.

12:06.371 --> 12:07.601
Where's Boots?

12:08.580 --> 12:09.882
Oh, he's in the barn.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.338
Okay, well, thanks, Clint.

12:20.220 --> 12:21.280
Hey, boy.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.216
How are you doing?

12:24.310 --> 12:25.621
I missed you.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.338
Hey, Luke?

12:28.100 --> 12:29.482
We should get started.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.461
All right,
why don't you show me what you got

12:37.466 --> 12:39.082
in your bag there?

12:45.380 --> 12:49.242
I found these from one of my old trucks.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.480
And uh...

12:50.791 --> 12:52.861
I found this in my train set.

12:53.850 --> 12:57.290
It was broken anyway,
but the motor's still good.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.802
Yeah, this is a good start.

13:00.050 --> 13:01.418
But you gotta find some gears,

13:01.450 --> 13:03.226
and then figure out a
way to get the power...

13:03.300 --> 13:04.549
to the wheels.

13:04.928 --> 13:06.485
Like a transmission.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.600
Yeah, like a transmission.

13:09.810 --> 13:11.952
Maybe you do know what you're talkin'
about.

13:12.230 --> 13:13.973
And maybe you do, too.

13:15.180 --> 13:17.642
All right, well,
let's go look in the Quonset hut.

13:57.434 --> 14:00.080
Mmm! Good tea, sweetheart.

14:00.990 --> 14:04.400
Okay, so we got the body
of the truck done today.

14:04.586 --> 14:05.890
And you like it, right, Luke?

14:06.106 --> 14:07.701
- Yep.
- Good.

14:08.030 --> 14:10.922
So tomorrow we can get
the gears all lined up,

14:10.944 --> 14:12.400
and hopefully...

14:12.830 --> 14:15.461
get the batteries
connected to the switch.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.021
What colour do you want to paint it,
Luke?

14:21.600 --> 14:22.602
Luke?

14:25.418 --> 14:28.938
Amy, are you okay?

14:30.720 --> 14:31.706
It's all right.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.704
Ty, I can't...

14:53.110 --> 14:54.840
Have you still got that fishing cabin?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.040
Yeah, yeah, I do.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.157
Well, that's what you do, then.

14:57.173 --> 14:58.940
You take yourself up there.

14:59.090 --> 15:02.490
As a matter of fact,
we both should go up there.

15:03.050 --> 15:06.848
How many songs did we write
in that cabin, oh my gosh!

15:07.290 --> 15:09.490
Some of them were God awful too,
weren't they?

15:10.013 --> 15:12.013
That is true.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.917
I agree with you,
Will, a fishing trip is due,

15:18.933 --> 15:20.144
let's set a date.

15:20.197 --> 15:21.781
That's right, I got a social calendar,

15:21.797 --> 15:23.658
I'm gonna fit you in.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.749
Here's to you, Will. Cheers.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.005
Good boy.

16:35.150 --> 16:37.658
Hey, do you see that? He's following me.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.568
Good boy.

16:40.613 --> 16:43.402
I see what you mean
about this being calming.

16:43.429 --> 16:44.373
It is kind of Zen.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.640
Yeah, it really quiets your mind.

16:46.656 --> 16:47.920
Yeah. It does.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.221
Speaking of,
is there something on yours?

16:52.870 --> 16:55.754
- I'm worried about my Mom.
- How so?

16:55.952 --> 16:59.622
It's just...
I think she's pretty upset...

16:59.810 --> 17:03.010
with Mitch, and the wedding,
and everything.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.810
Have you talked to her about it?

17:04.839 --> 17:07.109
I tried, but she didn't wanna go there.

17:07.150 --> 17:09.125
I don't think she's over him.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.880
Not at all.

17:13.146 --> 17:14.096
Okay, bud.

17:16.849 --> 17:18.064
Come on.

17:18.890 --> 17:20.730
Good boy, Phoenix.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.290
Come around.

17:22.329 --> 17:23.540
Good.

17:24.058 --> 17:25.119
All right.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.034
There you go!

17:27.530 --> 17:28.608
What do you think?

17:29.820 --> 17:30.704
It's fine.

17:32.740 --> 17:33.940
Just fine?

17:35.080 --> 17:37.322
I think it's a lot better than "fine".

17:37.740 --> 17:41.120
Let's get the wheels here,
and get it set up.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.290
Is Amy okay?

17:49.920 --> 17:50.784
Yeah.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.386
I saw her last night.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.397
She was sad.

18:04.770 --> 18:06.160
Yeah, she was.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.010
Our family lost a good friend.

18:10.410 --> 18:12.293
She was a little upset about it.

18:14.181 --> 18:15.882
She couldn't hold it in any longer.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.050
But you know,
sometimes that's the only way

18:19.066 --> 18:20.629
to start feeling better, Luke.

18:23.410 --> 18:26.154
We can't always hide our emotions.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.200
If we did, people wouldn't
know when we needed comfort.

18:30.230 --> 18:31.712
Or maybe some help.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.178
My mom cries sometimes.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.410
Yeah?

18:46.208 --> 18:47.957
Do you know what it's about?

18:48.280 --> 18:50.341
Well, she gets sad.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.808
And I'm like you are, with Amy.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.581
I try to make her feel better.

18:58.530 --> 18:59.685
That's good.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.338
That's the right thing to do.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.314
Well, I mean,
she doesn't cry all the time.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.000
She sometimes, she wants to have fun.

19:09.030 --> 19:10.940
Like we get up in the
middle of the night,

19:10.970 --> 19:14.373
and make pancakes,
and eat as many as we want.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.858
But then, after...

19:17.594 --> 19:19.334
she kinda gets sad again.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.680
How often does she get sad?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.069
I think I wanna paint it blue.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.730
Blue it is.

19:41.568 --> 19:43.216
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.456
Okay!

19:57.010 --> 20:00.064
So no one wants to bite today, huh?

20:02.501 --> 20:04.037
Okay.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.450
Hello? Jack?

20:19.910 --> 20:21.237
I'm home!

20:21.660 --> 20:24.464
Oh my goodness, look at this!

20:24.506 --> 20:27.350
Honey? Wow!

20:27.380 --> 20:28.350
Where is everybody?

20:28.384 --> 20:30.064
- Hey.
- Hi! How are you?

20:30.080 --> 20:31.898
Yeah, hey, good, you're back, huh?

20:31.925 --> 20:33.525
- Yes.
- Finally.

20:33.552 --> 20:35.620
Well, where is he?
I wanted to surprise him.

20:36.048 --> 20:37.168
Not here.

20:37.890 --> 20:39.221
Where is he?

20:41.690 --> 20:43.090
Um...

20:45.045 --> 20:45.770
What?

20:47.270 --> 20:49.400
Will Vernon passed away.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.360
He did? Oh no.

20:51.381 --> 20:54.910
Well, when? Why didn't he tell me that?

20:55.066 --> 20:57.466
He probably tried to get a hold of you,
but he...

20:57.514 --> 20:59.344
he couldn't because you
haven't exactly been easy

20:59.360 --> 21:01.410
to track down, so he probably gave up.

21:01.450 --> 21:02.880
Well, where is he?

21:04.069 --> 21:06.128
- Fishing cabin.
- By himself?

21:06.149 --> 21:08.050
He went by himself after
hearing about Will?

21:08.090 --> 21:10.720
I offered to go with him,
but he didn't want me to.

21:10.773 --> 21:13.626
So I think he just
needs some alone time.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.925
Well, I don't,
I don't think he should be alone.

21:18.630 --> 21:21.520
He's been alone for quite a while now,
Lisa.

21:23.970 --> 21:25.205
All right.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.380
Yes, sir!

21:39.390 --> 21:40.950
Look at that, Will!

21:40.990 --> 21:42.448
That's a beauty!

21:59.550 --> 22:01.973
Well, hello there.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.037
How did you get into this mess?

22:08.064 --> 22:10.154
Hold still. Oh, easy, now.

22:10.181 --> 22:11.482
Easy, now.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.952
Hold your horses, I got ya.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.072
There you go.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.330
Be free!

22:35.856 --> 22:38.512
Jack! Get up!

22:40.210 --> 22:41.536
Jack, get up!

22:44.069 --> 22:46.741
What're you gonna do,
just lay there in the ice cold water

22:46.752 --> 22:47.701
and freeze your butt off,

22:47.712 --> 22:50.650
instead of coming over here
and joining your old friend?

22:52.277 --> 22:53.658
Jack, get up!

23:01.390 --> 23:03.157
Will, you...

23:03.730 --> 23:05.700
you're here! You came!

23:06.320 --> 23:07.242
Oh, man!

23:07.397 --> 23:09.962
You gave me the scare of my life!

23:09.984 --> 23:11.002
I thought...

23:12.290 --> 23:14.021
I don't know how to tell you this,

23:14.053 --> 23:16.586
but someone's made a serious mistake,

23:16.597 --> 23:17.914
they think you...

23:18.840 --> 23:19.722
Well,

23:20.130 --> 23:23.669
you are gonna get a good
laugh out of this one.

23:25.994 --> 23:26.832
Okay.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.700
Have you got time for a chat?

23:50.780 --> 23:53.136
You feel we should be going,
I mean, he's-he's grieving,

23:53.162 --> 23:54.912
he shouldn't be alone.

23:55.450 --> 23:57.621
He's used to it by now.

24:00.741 --> 24:02.736
Okay, so you've been needling me

24:02.757 --> 24:04.709
since I walked through the door.

24:05.893 --> 24:06.709
If you have something to say,

24:06.720 --> 24:09.018
why don't you just come out and say it?

24:10.100 --> 24:12.453
Well, you've been away for months, Lisa.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.744
Jack hasn't been the
same since you left,

24:15.754 --> 24:18.522
I can't count the number of
times he's tried to call you.

24:20.540 --> 24:21.877
So I guess at the end of the day

24:21.893 --> 24:24.064
you just have to ask yourself
what's more important.

24:24.117 --> 24:25.626
Your aunt...

24:26.940 --> 24:27.909
or your husband?

24:27.930 --> 24:29.856
What?! Tim, that's not fair.

24:29.866 --> 24:32.050
My aunt has been extremely ill.

24:32.241 --> 24:35.051
- Needed me.
- Jack needed you, too.

24:40.210 --> 24:42.453
So this project's pretty
important to you, huh?

24:43.660 --> 24:45.562
Yeah, it is.

24:46.670 --> 24:48.432
It has to be perfect.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.565
Well, we're gonna do our best.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.088
Are you worried about your grades, Luke?

24:53.640 --> 24:56.592
No. It's my teachers.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.424
They say I don't pay attention.

24:59.980 --> 25:02.610
And they're always calling
my Mom or Clint about it.

25:03.650 --> 25:05.322
If I do good on this,

25:06.120 --> 25:09.125
it'll show them all that
I can do something right.

25:10.060 --> 25:11.434
And...

25:11.669 --> 25:13.488
it'll make my Mom proud.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.290
Well, I think we can make that happen.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.650
Wanna do a test drive?

25:21.530 --> 25:23.424
- Yeah!
- All right, let's do it.

25:25.586 --> 25:26.786
Set 'er down?

25:27.540 --> 25:29.301
- Okay, let's press the button.
- All right.

25:33.510 --> 25:35.840
Great! It doesn't work!

25:35.882 --> 25:37.162
This idea is stupid!

25:37.221 --> 25:38.698
You know we should've
done something else!

25:38.720 --> 25:41.350
Luke! Luke! Whoa, whoa, hey!
Hold on a sec, hey!

25:41.472 --> 25:43.658
Just relax, okay?

25:44.310 --> 25:45.984
Remember what we talked about.

25:46.474 --> 25:47.728
Take a breath.

25:51.330 --> 25:53.664
Now, we just need to adjust some gears,
okay?

25:53.728 --> 25:55.520
Happens all the time on my motorcycle.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.424
Why don't you put it
back up on the desk,

25:57.450 --> 25:58.549
and we'll take a look at it.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.680
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:06.710 --> 26:08.750
- Lisa's back?
- Yeah, um...

26:08.780 --> 26:10.620
but as soon as she got here,
she heard about Will,

26:10.661 --> 26:12.520
and her and Dad headed up to the cabin.

26:12.550 --> 26:13.893
Well, I think that's good.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.344
Grandpa shouldn't be alone right now.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.620
- Yeah.
- Hey, what's this?

26:17.696 --> 26:20.490
Oh,
it's just Mitch and Maya's wedding site.

26:20.805 --> 26:21.818
Listen to this.

26:21.893 --> 26:23.904
"In lieu of gifts,
please make a thoughtful donation

26:23.920 --> 26:25.440
to our favourite charity,

26:25.466 --> 26:27.829
Changing the World With Crystals."

26:28.020 --> 26:29.146
It's so Maya.

26:29.194 --> 26:31.640
Lou, you've gotta talk to me.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.408
Every time I ask how you're doing

26:33.429 --> 26:35.850
with this whole wedding thing,
you just shut me down.

26:35.882 --> 26:37.365
Well, you know, things have been

26:37.381 --> 26:38.965
just a little bit busy, Amy.

26:38.986 --> 26:40.581
Yes, but Georgie doesn't think

26:40.597 --> 26:43.120
that you're over Mitch yet.
Is that true?

26:43.749 --> 26:44.816
Hello?

26:45.696 --> 26:47.818
- Can I come in?
- Maya!

26:49.820 --> 26:50.848
Hi!

26:51.620 --> 26:52.874
Hi.

26:56.130 --> 26:59.146
Do you remember being
out there on the road

26:59.162 --> 27:02.538
month after month, rodeo after rodeo?

27:03.570 --> 27:06.940
The big payouts. The big parties.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.389
The big injuries.

27:08.432 --> 27:11.580
I remember that you were
competing at one stage with,

27:11.610 --> 27:14.096
we had four broke ribs, and a...

27:14.580 --> 27:16.032
oh, a collarbone.

27:16.058 --> 27:17.936
I had a busted collarbone, too.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.576
We were insane!

27:20.820 --> 27:22.453
Yes, I...

27:22.960 --> 27:24.320
I guess we were.

27:24.357 --> 27:26.760
I don't know how we made
it out of all that alive,

27:26.790 --> 27:28.360
to tell you the honest truth.

27:28.390 --> 27:30.400
But I just wanted you to know,

27:30.430 --> 27:33.600
they weren't just the wildest times,

27:33.632 --> 27:36.940
they were also some of the
happiest times of my life.

27:37.157 --> 27:38.117
Yeah.

27:38.670 --> 27:40.506
Yeah, those, those...

27:40.810 --> 27:43.050
those days were somethin', all right.

27:43.082 --> 27:45.980
But Pike River,
you remember that Christmas?

27:46.010 --> 27:48.506
When we saved them horses
that were trapped there

27:48.570 --> 27:50.357
in the avalanche, remember that?

27:50.564 --> 27:52.604
I do, yeah.

27:52.750 --> 27:57.140
That was quite the trick
to get them out alive.

27:57.490 --> 28:00.117
Yeah...
well, they weren't the only lives

28:00.144 --> 28:01.941
we saved that week.

28:03.530 --> 28:06.762
It was that Christmas,
Jack, you saved my life.

28:06.794 --> 28:09.456
- Ah, come on.
- No, you did.

28:09.498 --> 28:12.140
I would've died right,
right then and there

28:12.170 --> 28:14.670
in that house, just sittin' in there.

28:14.710 --> 28:16.610
I would've died for sure.

28:16.640 --> 28:20.410
But you, you brought back my family,

28:20.450 --> 28:22.010
you brought back my life.

28:22.050 --> 28:26.357
And now, well Jack,
you've brought back my ex-wife.

28:27.250 --> 28:32.180
Well today,
it's my turn to return the favour.

28:38.900 --> 28:42.341
You know, I was so totally
set on an outdoor ceremony.

28:42.453 --> 28:44.762
- You know, one with nature.
- Yeah...

28:44.789 --> 28:49.184
Oh, but no,
Mitch's family wanted a church wedding.

28:49.216 --> 28:51.056
I got my way on the reception, though.

28:51.093 --> 28:52.810
It's gonna be in the middle of a field,

28:52.826 --> 28:54.380
with these big white tents!

28:54.410 --> 28:56.554
Pinnacles of twinkly white lights?

28:56.950 --> 28:59.237
Exactly! How did you...

28:59.248 --> 29:00.282
how did you know?

29:00.314 --> 29:02.256
It's what I wanted for my wedding.

29:02.266 --> 29:05.360
But it didn't,
it didn't quite work that way.

29:05.930 --> 29:08.256
It'll happen for you, Lou.

29:08.512 --> 29:10.826
I know you'll meet someone

29:10.842 --> 29:13.664
who makes you just as
happy as Mitch has made me.

29:13.744 --> 29:15.472
I sure hope so.

29:15.690 --> 29:17.365
So, back to business.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.048
The reception,
I noticed you still haven't RSVP'd,

29:20.058 --> 29:21.701
are you bringing a "plus one"?

29:22.573 --> 29:23.973
- Um...
- Your date.

29:24.037 --> 29:25.701
I need the names for the place cards.

29:25.728 --> 29:28.053
Right, of course, the place cards.

29:28.106 --> 29:30.512
Those are important things. Place cards.

29:30.613 --> 29:33.008
You know,
Mitch hinted that you might have

29:33.018 --> 29:35.008
a special someone to invite?

29:35.045 --> 29:36.485
He did, did he?

29:36.890 --> 29:38.794
- Who?
- The um...

29:39.090 --> 29:40.528
you know, the grocery guy

29:40.549 --> 29:42.981
that Mitch's company
has the big deal with.

29:43.180 --> 29:46.112
Fred! That's his name. Fred Garland.

29:46.154 --> 29:48.300
Yeah. Yeah.
You can tell Mitch that's exactly

29:48.330 --> 29:49.557
who I'm bringing.'

29:49.669 --> 29:51.740
That's my "plus one".

29:52.020 --> 29:53.520
Amazing!

29:53.810 --> 29:55.728
I'm so glad you have someone.

29:58.554 --> 30:00.709
You should've seen Doreen's face

30:00.725 --> 30:04.288
when I showed up at her door after what,
ten years?

30:04.304 --> 30:05.616
Maybe more?

30:07.584 --> 30:10.240
And she takes one look
at me and she says,

30:10.370 --> 30:13.317
"I cannot believe you're
still driving around

30:13.328 --> 30:15.090
in that piece of crap!"

30:15.251 --> 30:17.221
My stupid truck.

30:18.970 --> 30:21.580
Yeah, I like Doreen.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.080
Oh yeah, salt of the earth, her.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.900
Come on, Jack.

30:25.940 --> 30:27.706
Time to go. Come here.

30:31.380 --> 30:32.980
I'd say it's uh,

30:33.010 --> 30:36.026
enough of the reminiscing
now at this point.

30:36.780 --> 30:39.320
I think it's time to get up, old friend.

30:42.042 --> 30:44.160
It's time to wake up.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.830
Will!

31:21.050 --> 31:23.380
Jack? Jack?

31:25.877 --> 31:28.458
Nope, he must be fishing.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.130
All right, well, this is a start.

31:35.410 --> 31:37.786
And he's got his fishing rod, so...

31:38.260 --> 31:40.170
I'm just gonna look down
around the bend, then.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.120
Jack?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.002
Okay.

31:43.590 --> 31:45.328
Okay, I'll go upriver.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.669
Hey Amy, come down here,

31:47.680 --> 31:49.386
we've got something to show you!

31:49.424 --> 31:51.088
No! Don't tell her!

31:51.136 --> 31:52.580
What if it doesn't work again?

31:52.610 --> 31:55.088
Hey! It's okay. You're among friends.

31:55.125 --> 31:58.042
And besides, I think it's gonna work.

31:58.266 --> 32:00.234
All right, Amy, you ready for this?

32:00.606 --> 32:02.066
All right Luke, hit the switch.

32:07.488 --> 32:08.821
Look at that!

32:09.632 --> 32:10.874
Hey!

32:11.990 --> 32:15.312
Wow, look at that, Boots!

32:15.370 --> 32:16.800
It works!

32:16.840 --> 32:19.370
That is so cool!

32:37.600 --> 32:38.560
Jack?

32:40.270 --> 32:43.018
Dad, I just,
I wanna know if you guys are doing okay.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.666
Call me back when you get this.

32:46.981 --> 32:47.930
Wow!

32:48.230 --> 32:50.986
You and Maya really have a
way of sneaking up on me.

32:51.029 --> 32:54.026
I'm sorry, I knocked,
but you were just on the...

32:56.005 --> 32:58.380
- So...
- So...

33:00.010 --> 33:02.180
Maya tells me you're bringing Fred

33:02.220 --> 33:03.888
as a guest to the wedding.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.800
You know, I think that's great.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.962
Mitch,
I'm not bringing Fred to the wedding.

33:12.260 --> 33:14.360
I'm not bringing anyone because um,

33:14.390 --> 33:15.925
I don't think I can be there.

33:15.941 --> 33:17.968
What? Why?

33:18.230 --> 33:20.485
What,
you're not gonna come to my wedding?

33:20.517 --> 33:22.853
It's just not a good time.
Georgie's been sick,

33:22.874 --> 33:24.234
and I don't know if you know this,

33:24.245 --> 33:26.138
but my Grandfather's oldest friend,
Will Vernon,

33:26.144 --> 33:28.634
just passed away, so...

33:30.640 --> 33:34.069
I... I didn't, I'm sorry.

33:36.330 --> 33:38.149
And anyway, Mitch, why...

33:40.960 --> 33:42.400
why would you even want me there?

33:42.432 --> 33:43.296
Why?

33:44.500 --> 33:47.269
- What do you mean, why?
- Just a simple question.

33:47.550 --> 33:48.736
Why?

33:49.130 --> 33:50.560
Because I want you.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.000
At the wedding. I...

33:56.741 --> 33:58.138
Well, I'll think about it.

34:01.310 --> 34:03.658
Well, I hope to see you there.

34:22.821 --> 34:24.341
Oh no, Jack!

34:25.536 --> 34:26.420
Jack!

34:27.335 --> 34:29.846
Jack, you gotta get it together,
come on.

34:33.370 --> 34:35.402
I've seen you wounded
way worse than this,

34:35.418 --> 34:38.409
and still make it home alive,
so come on, let's go.

34:40.469 --> 34:42.666
I need to thank you, Will.

34:45.179 --> 34:46.505
Yeah, I do.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.150
For everything you've done for me.

34:49.190 --> 34:50.080
Oh...

34:54.060 --> 34:56.789
You can't be gone, Will.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.470
It's too soon.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.800
I've got no regrets now.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.140
These past few years
have just been golden,

35:06.165 --> 35:07.940
thanks to you.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.610
The only thing I worry
about is them horses.

35:12.650 --> 35:15.200
So if you wanna thank me,

35:15.800 --> 35:17.386
you could look in on 'em.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.730
I'll do that.

35:23.690 --> 35:25.717
Good. Thanks.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.530
You're my best friend, Will.

35:36.470 --> 35:38.666
And I never told you that.

35:38.970 --> 35:39.904
Oh...

35:41.070 --> 35:44.805
I was gonna tell you, I was.

35:45.750 --> 35:48.640
I was gonna tell you on this trip,
but then...

35:51.520 --> 35:53.733
Well, you have, and now you have again,

35:53.749 --> 35:55.420
so we're square.

36:00.260 --> 36:01.370
Jack!

36:02.230 --> 36:05.560
You hear that?
Someone's lookin' out for you.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.070
I don't wanna leave you, Will.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.314
Jack?

36:11.040 --> 36:12.256
Not yet.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.093
You have to.

36:20.202 --> 36:22.320
- That's just it.
- Jack!

36:22.362 --> 36:25.620
Answer the man.
Let him know you're here.

36:25.650 --> 36:26.634
Yeah...

36:27.890 --> 36:29.632
No, no, no, no, louder.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.030
I'm here.

36:34.210 --> 36:38.069
- Jack?
- Yeah... I'm here.

36:38.090 --> 36:41.120
- Jack! Hey! Hey!
- I'm here...

36:42.928 --> 36:44.869
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

36:44.885 --> 36:47.850
You okay? Easy, come on.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.200
Yeah, okay...

36:55.328 --> 36:57.180
Okay, all right.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.160
Okay, come on, Jack.

37:00.572 --> 37:02.002
All right.

37:08.830 --> 37:10.277
That's it.

37:13.335 --> 37:14.965
There you are, what happened?

37:15.013 --> 37:16.130
Oh my goodness!

37:16.170 --> 37:18.640
What happened?
What happened? Oh, sweetie!

37:18.670 --> 37:21.670
Are you okay? What-what happened, honey?

37:21.710 --> 37:23.338
It's okay.

37:23.365 --> 37:25.653
Oh, sweetie. Are you okay?

37:25.680 --> 37:26.944
Let me see you.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.672
Oh!

37:29.328 --> 37:31.168
Hi! Hi!

37:31.520 --> 37:32.950
It's okay.

37:33.866 --> 37:36.992
Okay, let's get him to the cabin.

37:37.002 --> 37:38.394
Come on, let's go inside.

37:38.416 --> 37:40.460
Come on. Come on, let's get you inside.

37:40.490 --> 37:42.130
- Let's go.
- Okay, come on.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.330
Can you tell me what happened?

37:55.717 --> 37:58.373
Well, that fridge keeps
everything at a perfect,

37:58.405 --> 38:00.085
perfect temperature.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.506
What a beautiful gift, thank you.

38:02.709 --> 38:04.640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:07.190 --> 38:08.176
Mmm!

38:12.500 --> 38:13.722
Hey Lise...

38:15.402 --> 38:17.500
we're okay, aren't we? You and me?

38:17.540 --> 38:18.362
Honey.

38:20.510 --> 38:22.370
I'm sorry I was away for so long.

38:22.410 --> 38:23.610
I was so torn, I mean,

38:23.621 --> 38:25.940
if you could've seen Aunt Evelyn,
she just...

38:25.957 --> 38:28.138
You don't need to explain.

38:28.952 --> 38:30.952
You did what you had to do.

38:32.820 --> 38:34.450
It's funny, isn't it?

38:34.490 --> 38:38.021
How we can think of
family as being so strong,

38:38.037 --> 38:40.560
when it's actually so delicate.

38:41.630 --> 38:43.760
I don't know what I
would do without you,

38:43.800 --> 38:44.896
I really don't.

38:50.853 --> 38:53.440
I'm so happy to be home with you,
Cowboy.

38:56.266 --> 38:58.256
I want to play something for you.

38:58.277 --> 38:59.264
Oh, good.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.020
This is a song...

39:06.608 --> 39:09.130
Will wrote for his wife.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.018
For Doreen.

39:11.790 --> 39:14.144
But I kinda think it was meant for us,
too.

Hi! Hi.

40:38.224 --> 40:40.064
I got the highest mark!

40:40.080 --> 40:42.805
- I won first place!
- Fantastic!

40:42.820 --> 40:44.620
Good for you, Luke!

40:44.650 --> 40:46.224
I want you to have it.

40:47.013 --> 40:50.010
Um, well,
you think your mom would want that, or?

40:51.220 --> 40:54.190
No, you're the one who helped me.

40:56.090 --> 40:57.498
Thanks, Luke.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.026
I'll-I'll put this on the fridge, okay?

41:02.170 --> 41:03.706
How about right there?

41:04.360 --> 41:06.314
Looks pretty good, what do you think?

41:16.280 --> 41:18.757
- Hi, Lyndy. Hi!
- Hi!

41:18.789 --> 41:19.909
Hello?

41:21.360 --> 41:23.696
Sorry, he bolted up the stairs

41:23.722 --> 41:25.146
before I even got out of the car.

41:25.152 --> 41:27.050
That's all right, do you want anything?

41:27.072 --> 41:29.290
No, thanks, but um...

41:29.800 --> 41:31.088
Can we talk?

41:32.160 --> 41:33.530
Yeah, yeah, sure.

41:37.070 --> 41:38.500
Is everything okay?

41:42.210 --> 41:44.208
Yeah, let's put this here. That's good.

41:44.256 --> 41:45.952
It's Luke's mother.

41:47.600 --> 41:51.150
She doesn't feel that she
can take care of him anymore.

41:51.490 --> 41:54.149
Not properly, so uh...

41:54.950 --> 41:57.749
I'm afraid I'm looking into foster care.

41:57.781 --> 41:58.464
Here.

42:02.330 --> 42:04.709
- You made some tea.
- Yeah.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.725
You're lucky.

42:10.090 --> 42:12.090
You wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for me.

42:12.106 --> 42:13.664
It wasn't just you.

42:14.170 --> 42:15.114
What?

42:15.290 --> 42:16.282
Nothing.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.650
Ah, come on.

42:26.050 --> 42:28.176
That's twice I've saved your life.

42:29.860 --> 42:31.790
I guess that is true.

42:33.820 --> 42:36.789
Now I've just gotta figure
out how to save my own.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.760
What's that supposed to mean?

42:39.792 --> 42:41.386
Come on, Jack.

42:42.410 --> 42:45.114
Look at me, I got a big second chance.

42:45.184 --> 42:46.730
Just like Will.

42:47.380 --> 42:48.901
And what did I do?

42:50.050 --> 42:51.034
Nothing.

42:52.580 --> 42:55.010
Lost and alone.

42:58.950 --> 43:01.354
That cannot be my best life.

43:01.450 --> 43:03.520
All right.

43:05.029 --> 43:07.120
All right, if you wanna move that thing

43:07.130 --> 43:09.200
into the yard here, just do it,

43:09.226 --> 43:11.850
'cause you're going to
sneak up on me anyway.
