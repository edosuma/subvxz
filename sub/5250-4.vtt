WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.835
Another Yom Kippur.

00:02.835 --> 00:05.071
Do you think Bethenny
Frankel's fasting today?

00:05.071 --> 00:06.406
Uh yeah, but not because she knows

00:06.406 --> 00:07.674
what day it is.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.075
Oh, these fucking shoes.

00:09.075 --> 00:10.777
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

00:10.777 --> 00:11.844
I never see you in a chunky heel,

00:11.844 --> 00:13.246
only a sassy flat.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.981
I'm going to my mom's break-fast later

00:14.981 --> 00:15.982
and Nicole's gonna be there

00:15.982 --> 00:17.050
and she's always dressed up.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.351
Wait, which one is Nicole again?

00:18.351 --> 00:19.919
Is that the Uber driver
that tried to sell us

00:19.919 --> 00:20.987
a friendship bracelet?

00:20.987 --> 00:22.355
No, it's another person we hate.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.324
She's that annoying psychology student

00:24.324 --> 00:25.758
who's obsessed with my mom.

00:25.758 --> 00:26.993
She looks great without makeup,

00:26.993 --> 00:28.228
she likes hiking,

00:28.228 --> 00:29.829
she has no food issues.

00:29.829 --> 00:30.730
She's basically the daughter

00:30.730 --> 00:32.165
my mom always wanted.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.800
Yeah, family is the
worst way to meet someone

00:33.800 --> 00:35.001
that you have nothing in common with.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.236
So how did you suckered into going

00:36.236 --> 00:37.470
to your brother's for Yom Kippur?

00:37.470 --> 00:39.205
You said last year, "Never again!"

00:39.205 --> 00:41.174
Which, honestly, was a little on the nose.

00:41.174 --> 00:44.777
I know, I got a call from an unknown number

00:44.777 --> 00:46.846
and I thought it was
that agent Skippy Truce,

00:46.846 --> 00:48.948
the one that likes me, but
it wasn't, it was Garry.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.083
Does your brother spell "Gary"

00:50.083 --> 00:51.084
with one R?

00:51.084 --> 00:52.919
Oh, I wish. Two Rs.

00:52.919 --> 00:53.953
The bad Garry.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.755
Of course.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.691
Hello? Yeah!

00:58.691 --> 01:00.426
Oh my God, yes! Yes, that's amazing.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.428
That's so great.

01:02.428 --> 01:03.429
Okay, thank you.

01:03.429 --> 01:04.263
Thank you! Okay, bye.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.098
I got an agent!

01:05.098 --> 01:06.466
(screaming)

01:06.466 --> 01:07.967
- That's amazing!
- Oh my God, I'm sorry!

01:07.967 --> 01:09.068
I'm screaming, I know,

01:09.068 --> 01:10.169
I'll buy your agave syrup.

01:10.169 --> 01:11.204
I can't believe it!

01:11.204 --> 01:12.338
I'm represented.

01:12.338 --> 01:13.706
- I am represented.
- Finally!

01:13.706 --> 01:15.241
I am represented! Yes!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.310
- That's amazing.
- Oh, I can't.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.078
He said I have a John C. Reilly quality.

01:19.078 --> 01:20.880
- I've always thought that.
- Yes!

01:20.880 --> 01:21.948
Do you think it's a little weird

01:21.948 --> 01:23.349
he called on Yom Kippur?

01:23.349 --> 01:24.717
No, no, no, he's not Jewish.

01:24.717 --> 01:25.852
(groans)

01:25.852 --> 01:27.854
Julie, no! Julie, no, no, no!

01:27.854 --> 01:29.188
It's fine! He's good.

01:29.188 --> 01:30.390
I'm telling you, he's legit.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.158
He knows all those guys at HBO.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.459
What more do you need?

01:33.459 --> 01:35.328
You have to pitch a series to HBO

01:35.328 --> 01:36.763
about a network that passed on

01:36.763 --> 01:38.197
all the good shows and all it was left with

01:38.197 --> 01:40.867
was "The Leftovers."

01:40.867 --> 01:42.935
Yes! Or what about a "Fraggle Rock" reboot

01:42.935 --> 01:44.737
except all the Fraggles are trans?

01:44.737 --> 01:46.272
You think that's too close to "Looking"?

01:46.272 --> 01:50.272
â™ª

01:53.867 --> 01:56.336
(laughter)

01:56.336 --> 01:57.437
Julie, come in.

01:57.437 --> 01:58.738
Hug Nicole.

01:58.738 --> 02:00.607
She's helping me because you were late.

02:00.607 --> 02:01.741
- Julie.
- Hey, Nicole.

02:01.741 --> 02:02.943
Oh, look at you.

02:02.943 --> 02:04.110
I'm still in my workout clothes.

02:04.110 --> 02:06.379
Oh, natural beauty.

02:06.379 --> 02:07.614
Julie, get the juice

02:07.614 --> 02:08.782
out of the fridge, please,

02:08.782 --> 02:10.317
before your father comes back

02:10.317 --> 02:11.518
with the lox.

02:11.518 --> 02:13.353
So, Julie, are you still writing?

02:13.353 --> 02:14.554
Well, I just live-blogged

02:14.554 --> 02:16.323
the Emmys last month.

02:16.323 --> 02:17.524
Twelve of the people I took

02:17.524 --> 02:19.859
improv classes with won statues

02:19.859 --> 02:21.328
and one of them hosted.

02:21.328 --> 02:22.395
Oh, that's impressive.

02:22.395 --> 02:23.563
Yeah, for them.

02:23.563 --> 02:25.465
How's psychology school?

02:25.465 --> 02:26.866
Uh, I'm already done.

02:26.866 --> 02:28.568
Yeah, she's got a graduation party

02:28.568 --> 02:30.003
on Sunday.

02:30.003 --> 02:31.671
Do you have a clean dress?

02:31.671 --> 02:32.872
Why isn't your mom hosting

02:32.872 --> 02:34.674
a graduation party for you?

02:34.674 --> 02:35.742
Because her mother

02:35.742 --> 02:37.877
just joined Scientology.

02:37.877 --> 02:39.079
Oh, it's terrible.

02:39.079 --> 02:40.547
Those people hate psychologists.

02:40.547 --> 02:41.748
You know we're

02:41.748 --> 02:43.016
the chief competitor of any cult.

02:43.016 --> 02:44.818
Wait a minute, Nicole, does this mean

02:44.818 --> 02:45.852
you know Anne Archer?

02:45.852 --> 02:46.886
Okay, just ignore her.

02:46.886 --> 02:47.887
I love her.

02:47.887 --> 02:49.723
Honey, help me with the bagels.

02:49.723 --> 02:51.858
Nicole is fasting.

02:51.858 --> 02:53.693
I can't because it's uncomfortable,

02:53.693 --> 02:55.061
and Julie can't because she's hungry

02:55.061 --> 02:56.496
all the time.

02:56.496 --> 02:58.298
Oh, is that because you work out?

02:58.298 --> 02:59.466
Come on, Nicole.

02:59.466 --> 03:01.368
No, Nicole's doing this...

03:01.368 --> 03:02.469
what is the name of that,

03:02.469 --> 03:03.803
that great new exercise thing?

03:03.803 --> 03:05.372
Oh, Bernie's Bootcamp.

03:05.372 --> 03:07.674
- Yeah, that's right.
- Every day at six a.m.

03:07.674 --> 03:10.643
Can you believe that?
"Private Benjamin" stuff.

03:10.643 --> 03:13.780
It's mud trenches, chin-ups,

03:13.780 --> 03:15.749
and there's an Army guy with a whistle.

03:15.749 --> 03:16.950
That's what you gotta do

03:16.950 --> 03:18.752
to have this body. Show that off.

03:18.752 --> 03:20.653
Look at that beautiful bootcamp body.

03:20.653 --> 03:21.788
- You.
- Stop it!

03:21.788 --> 03:23.323
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I guess

03:23.323 --> 03:24.958
I just find that a little offensive.

03:24.958 --> 03:27.460
Honey, what is your problem?

03:27.460 --> 03:29.396
I don't know, just a military themed

03:29.396 --> 03:30.830
exercise class?

03:30.830 --> 03:33.433
I... think it minimizes the contributions

03:33.433 --> 03:35.635
that veterans have made to society.

03:35.635 --> 03:37.437
Well, I had no idea that
you were so concerned

03:37.437 --> 03:39.339
about protecting veterans in society.

03:39.339 --> 03:40.673
Yeah, well, I, uh,

03:40.673 --> 03:42.709
have a lot of friends who are veterans.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.744
- No you don't.
- Of course I do.

03:44.744 --> 03:46.713
There's a lot you don't
know about me, Nicole.

03:46.713 --> 03:47.814
Well, how did you meet them?

03:47.814 --> 03:48.882
Volunteering.

03:48.882 --> 03:49.983
But you don't volunteer.

03:49.983 --> 03:51.384
Tell that to my comedy career

03:51.384 --> 03:52.519
'cause it's basically just

03:52.519 --> 03:53.820
one big unpaid internship.

03:53.820 --> 03:54.921
I don't believe you.

03:54.921 --> 03:56.423
I've seen you with one friend

03:56.423 --> 03:57.724
and it's that loud gay guy

03:57.724 --> 03:58.925
that you bring around.

03:58.925 --> 04:00.894
I have lots of friends, Nicole,

04:00.894 --> 04:02.929
so many of whom are veterans.

04:02.929 --> 04:04.531
In fact, I'm gonna bring one of them

04:04.531 --> 04:06.566
to your graduation party.

04:06.566 --> 04:08.468
How do you like that? Huh?

04:08.468 --> 04:09.903
That would be amazing.

04:09.903 --> 04:11.037
I can't wait to meet him.

04:11.037 --> 04:12.906
Arthur's here!

04:12.906 --> 04:14.441
Chag sameach, Marilyn.

04:14.441 --> 04:17.377
You look like Julie's beautiful sister.

04:17.377 --> 04:19.546
You know, this looks like something

04:19.546 --> 04:21.781
that you would love to drink, Arthur.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.883
Hey Mom, just because Arthur's a WASP

04:23.883 --> 04:25.652
doesn't mean he's an alcoholic.

04:25.652 --> 04:27.587
Hm. It probably does.

04:27.587 --> 04:29.522
Arthur, you remember Nicole, right?

04:29.522 --> 04:30.757
Wanna hear something funny?

04:30.757 --> 04:32.525
Her mom knows John Travolta.

04:32.525 --> 04:33.960
- Oh really?
- Isn't that great?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.329
- John Travolta.
- Let it go!

04:36.329 --> 04:40.329
â™ª

04:44.804 --> 04:46.773
Billy!

04:46.773 --> 04:48.441
Come here. Chag sameach!

04:48.441 --> 04:49.509
Hey, Garry.

04:49.509 --> 04:50.710
Big hug, come in,

04:50.710 --> 04:51.978
it's freezing out there.

04:51.978 --> 04:53.480
- Take your coat off.
- Sure.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.749
Boy, sorry, I was just, uh...

04:56.749 --> 04:58.618
You got a lot of mezuzahs out there.

04:58.618 --> 04:59.986
Yeah, three of them are doorbells.

04:59.986 --> 05:01.387
Oh really?

05:01.387 --> 05:02.322
Come in, here, I got it, I got it,

05:02.322 --> 05:03.756
let go, let go, let go.

05:03.756 --> 05:04.891
Here, here.

05:04.891 --> 05:06.292
Wow, you guys keep it smelling

05:06.292 --> 05:07.694
like pot roast and boiled carrots

05:07.694 --> 05:09.729
around here all year long.

05:09.729 --> 05:10.797
Thank you very much.

05:10.797 --> 05:12.365
Rachel, look who's here.

05:12.365 --> 05:14.467
Tal, Renee, get out of the goddamn kitchen

05:14.467 --> 05:16.336
and say hello to your Uncle Billy.

05:16.336 --> 05:17.504
Hey Tal, Hey Renee.

05:17.504 --> 05:18.605
Hi, Uncle Billy.

05:18.605 --> 05:20.507
Why aren't you famous yet?

05:20.507 --> 05:22.575
Renee is going through her cunt phase.

05:22.575 --> 05:24.577
That's okay, me too. Hello, Rachel.

05:24.577 --> 05:25.845
Tal, you wanna tell Billy what your

05:25.845 --> 05:28.448
bat mitzvah party theme's gonna be?

05:28.448 --> 05:30.583
- "It gets better." 
- Are you gay?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.585
I wish. Just chubby.

05:32.585 --> 05:33.887
(chuckling)

05:33.887 --> 05:35.421
Renee, put away your cell phone

05:35.421 --> 05:36.623
or I'll take your flat iron

05:36.623 --> 05:38.424
and bury it so far up your ass,

05:38.424 --> 05:40.360
your throat will burn.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.794
It's a real threat.

05:41.794 --> 05:42.862
Yom Kippur!

05:42.862 --> 05:44.364
(awkward chuckling)

05:44.364 --> 05:45.498
Sit down.

05:45.498 --> 05:46.666
Gotta hear it all day long.

05:46.666 --> 05:47.901
I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.

05:47.901 --> 05:50.036
They're at that age, huh?

05:50.036 --> 05:51.804
It's a real treat having
you here, you know?

05:51.804 --> 05:52.839
I don't see you enough.

05:52.839 --> 05:54.040
I've seen you, I think,

05:54.040 --> 05:55.942
twice since Dad's funeral.

05:55.942 --> 05:56.910
Mm-hm.

05:56.910 --> 05:58.011
Let me tell you something.

05:58.011 --> 05:59.679
There's only two of us left.

05:59.679 --> 06:01.381
That's it, the last people on Earth.

06:01.381 --> 06:02.582
- The last people... 
- It's up to us.

06:02.582 --> 06:04.517
The last people on Earth.

06:04.517 --> 06:05.652
And we're sitting in this house.

06:05.652 --> 06:07.654
Yes, Dad died and that's it.

06:07.654 --> 06:08.888
Uh, no, I know, I know,

06:08.888 --> 06:10.323
and I'm sorry about that.

06:10.323 --> 06:11.524
I should see you guys more

06:11.524 --> 06:12.926
but I don't want to.

06:12.926 --> 06:14.060
I'm just kidding.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.528
Rachel, Billy did a joke

06:15.528 --> 06:16.663
and he said, "I would see you more,

06:16.663 --> 06:17.764
but I don't want to."

06:17.764 --> 06:18.831
He's very funny.

06:18.831 --> 06:20.934
I was kidding. Thank you.

06:20.934 --> 06:22.302
No, but you know, you don't have to

06:22.302 --> 06:23.903
mention that every time I come over.

06:23.903 --> 06:25.805
It's not like I'm gonna forget.

06:25.805 --> 06:27.073
Dad died, you know,

06:27.073 --> 06:29.742
like it's my keys or Minnie Driver.

06:29.742 --> 06:32.045
(chuckling)

06:32.045 --> 06:34.380
Um, I have two pieces of good news

06:34.380 --> 06:36.516
that I wanted to share from my world.

06:36.516 --> 06:37.784
I can't wait to hear it.

06:37.784 --> 06:39.619
Number one: John Stamos

06:39.619 --> 06:42.322
was delightful on "The Chew" yesterday.

06:42.322 --> 06:43.823
How about it? That's great!

06:43.823 --> 06:45.425
No, no, I'm kidding.

06:45.425 --> 06:47.360
- You're joking?
- It was a joke.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.762
- Billy.
- And number two:

06:49.762 --> 06:50.797
I got a new agent.

06:50.797 --> 06:52.065
Two bits of good news.

06:52.065 --> 06:53.333
Rachel, did you hear that?

06:53.333 --> 06:55.835
Billy's got a new agent.

06:55.835 --> 06:57.036
But you gotta remember, you know,

06:57.036 --> 06:58.037
there's other things in your life

06:58.037 --> 06:59.672
you need, you know?

06:59.672 --> 07:02.041
You need a special
someone to share this with.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.743
Garry, pick up your fucking shoes!

07:03.743 --> 07:05.345
They stink!

07:05.345 --> 07:07.580
All right, sorry about that.

07:07.580 --> 07:10.316
Um... how's the dry cleaning business?

07:10.316 --> 07:12.318
- Better than ever.
- Really?

07:12.318 --> 07:13.953
- Better than ever.
- Great.

07:13.953 --> 07:15.588
Here's a fun overlap actually,

07:15.588 --> 07:17.056
is that a lot of the Broadway shows

07:17.056 --> 07:19.325
are coming to me now.

07:19.325 --> 07:20.493
I'm cleaning the costumes...

07:20.493 --> 07:22.595
-... for "On The Town."
- Oh wow.

07:22.595 --> 07:24.097
Do you know that show, "On The Town"?

07:24.097 --> 07:25.698
Everybody into the dining room,

07:25.698 --> 07:27.934
it's time for the first hour of blessings.

07:27.934 --> 07:30.603
â™ª

07:30.603 --> 07:32.005
Both self-satisfied...

07:32.005 --> 07:33.706
I mean, where does Nicole even get off

07:33.706 --> 07:35.074
saying I don't have any veteran friends?

07:35.074 --> 07:36.342
Well, Noodles, you don't.

07:36.342 --> 07:37.810
Yeah, I know, but who is she?

07:37.810 --> 07:40.446
Nobody. Just a beautiful, obedient redhead

07:40.446 --> 07:41.848
that my mother wishes that I was.

07:41.848 --> 07:43.616
Well, I don't wish you were anybody else.

07:43.616 --> 07:45.385
She has the nerve to tell me

07:45.385 --> 07:47.053
how she thinks I live my life?

07:47.053 --> 07:48.721
I don't think so.

07:48.721 --> 07:50.056
You watch me become the person

07:50.056 --> 07:51.391
Nicole doesn't believe I am

07:51.391 --> 07:53.026
just to teach her a lesson.

07:53.026 --> 07:54.427
I'll find some veteran friends.

07:54.427 --> 07:55.795
I'll even volunteer.

07:55.795 --> 07:57.664
That'll show the bitch.

07:59.332 --> 08:01.434
Siri, where can I volunteer tonight

08:01.434 --> 08:02.568
with veterans?

08:02.568 --> 08:03.636
Tonight?

08:03.636 --> 08:04.971
I don't want you cavorting around

08:04.971 --> 08:06.806
New York City at night with military men.

08:06.806 --> 08:08.341
Oh, Arthur, I'll be fine.

08:08.341 --> 08:09.642
I insist on coming with you.

08:09.642 --> 08:12.779
I don't want you to be you-know-whated.

08:12.779 --> 08:14.047
Did I ever tell you about the time that

08:14.047 --> 08:15.481
Laura Linney tried to walk to her car

08:15.481 --> 08:16.649
alone after a day of recording

08:16.649 --> 08:18.584
intros to "Downton Abbey"?

08:18.584 --> 08:19.986
- No.
- Well, she kept telling me

08:19.986 --> 08:21.487
to go, but I wouldn't hear of it.

08:21.487 --> 08:23.990
You have to escort a lady to her vehicle.

08:23.990 --> 08:25.825
And sure enough, she was followed

08:25.825 --> 08:27.827
by a crazy fan.

08:27.827 --> 08:29.462
He kept shouting, "Hey, Laura Dern!

08:29.462 --> 08:31.397
Amy Adams! Holly Hunter!"

08:31.397 --> 08:32.732
It wasn't until I told him who she was

08:32.732 --> 08:34.933
that he left her alone.

08:34.933 --> 08:37.669
Um, before I bless the bread and the wine

08:37.669 --> 08:39.005
and the salad forks

08:39.005 --> 08:41.874
and the napkin holders,

08:41.874 --> 08:44.010
I want to say something to Uncle Billy.

08:44.010 --> 08:46.379
And I'm sure I speak for everybody here

08:46.379 --> 08:49.615
when I say that we are absolutely fine

08:49.615 --> 08:53.386
with you being gay.

08:53.386 --> 08:55.088
Okay.

08:55.088 --> 08:58.358
And, um, I am still coming to terms

08:58.358 --> 09:01.461
with the fact that you like Billy Joel.

09:01.461 --> 09:03.529
So.

09:03.529 --> 09:04.731
I'm proud of my record collection,

09:04.731 --> 09:06.065
I'll admit that.

09:06.065 --> 09:09.702
But Billy, look around the table.

09:09.702 --> 09:10.803
Move your head around

09:10.803 --> 09:12.572
and just take it all in.

09:12.572 --> 09:14.941
We are your family

09:14.941 --> 09:16.843
and we want you to feel

09:16.843 --> 09:18.044
comfortable in our home.

09:18.044 --> 09:21.614
Well, I don't.

09:21.614 --> 09:23.516
- I'm just kidding.
- You were being honest.

09:23.516 --> 09:24.817
No, I wasn't. I'm kidding.

09:24.817 --> 09:26.052
I don't know if you're just kidding.

09:26.052 --> 09:27.453
- Stop it, please.
- No, I'm not gonna stop.

09:27.453 --> 09:28.654
Come on, let's eat.

09:28.654 --> 09:30.556
Can you take smaller bites, please?

09:30.556 --> 09:31.557
I can't let out the seams

09:31.557 --> 09:32.658
in your bat mitzvah dress,

09:32.658 --> 09:33.926
there's not enough fabric.

09:33.926 --> 09:35.928
Norma Aronoff got her dress at Saks.

09:35.928 --> 09:37.630
That's because Moshe Aronoff

09:37.630 --> 09:39.832
invented a laser you can use on skin tags

09:39.832 --> 09:41.033
and he was smart enough to patent it.

09:41.033 --> 09:42.535
That's besides the point.

09:42.535 --> 09:44.737
- Why would you say that?
- That is not a patent.

09:44.737 --> 09:46.572
- He had permission.
- How is it not a patent?

09:46.572 --> 09:48.408
You look fine, by the way.

09:48.408 --> 09:50.443
And you would never say that to Renee.

09:50.443 --> 09:51.778
Guys, everybody, everybody,

09:51.778 --> 09:53.946
there's no reason to shout about it.

09:53.946 --> 09:55.848
What's not comfortable about this?

09:55.848 --> 09:57.483
So, Billy, why are you uncomfortable?

09:57.483 --> 09:58.618
I'm not uncomfortable,

09:58.618 --> 09:59.685
I just don't understand

09:59.685 --> 10:03.856
when everything got so Jewish!

10:03.856 --> 10:05.858
It's fine, it's just
not who we were as kids.

10:05.858 --> 10:08.528
I mean, we didn't even
fast when we were kids.

10:08.528 --> 10:10.329
Look, I don't know what
you people are doing,

10:10.329 --> 10:11.397
if it works for you, great...

10:11.397 --> 10:12.698
It's the holiest day of the year.

10:12.698 --> 10:13.766
But Garry, here's the thing.

10:13.766 --> 10:14.801
You know what the holiest day

10:14.801 --> 10:16.402
of the year is for me?

10:16.402 --> 10:17.904
The Golden Globes.

10:17.904 --> 10:19.372
I don't care about the blessings.

10:19.372 --> 10:21.908
I care about the SAG Awards.

10:21.908 --> 10:24.944
And no one cares about those.

10:24.944 --> 10:27.447
Show business, Garry.

10:27.447 --> 10:30.082
That's what I care about.

10:30.082 --> 10:32.518
That's the most Jewish
thing I've ever heard.

10:32.518 --> 10:34.520
â™ª

10:34.520 --> 10:36.456
VA hospitals never close.

10:36.456 --> 10:37.623
They are perfect for late night

10:37.623 --> 10:38.958
impulse volunteering.

10:38.958 --> 10:40.827
Noods, I don't think you can just show up

10:40.827 --> 10:41.928
and start browsing the hospital

10:41.928 --> 10:42.962
for friends unannounced.

10:42.962 --> 10:44.730
Oh, I'll announce myself.

10:44.730 --> 10:48.868
â™ª

10:48.868 --> 10:51.404
Hello! Hello.

10:51.404 --> 10:52.505
Hello.

10:52.505 --> 10:54.040
My name is Julie Kessler

10:54.040 --> 10:54.974
and I'm here to volunteer

10:54.974 --> 10:56.676
with some veterans.

10:56.676 --> 11:00.112
Good morning, Vietnam!

11:02.381 --> 11:03.683
â™ª

11:03.683 --> 11:04.984
What did you say you were here for?

11:04.984 --> 11:06.486
To volunteer.

11:06.486 --> 11:08.321
Well, you can't just walk in.

11:08.321 --> 11:09.722
Are you here with a group?

11:09.722 --> 11:11.357
(stuttering) Yeah, I'm with a...

11:11.357 --> 11:12.558
I'm in the Bee Gees.

11:12.558 --> 11:14.360
This is why healthcare is broken.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.362
- No, no, no... 
- Need a room!

11:16.362 --> 11:17.630
We got a screamer!

11:17.630 --> 11:19.966
Now! Now!

11:19.966 --> 11:22.768
(screaming)

11:24.537 --> 11:26.072
Ten minutes, I'll find a friend,

11:26.072 --> 11:28.040
and then we'll go home, okay?

11:28.040 --> 11:29.775
I love you!

11:29.775 --> 11:32.979
â™ª

11:32.979 --> 11:34.714
Candles, I know you want to show up Nicole,

11:34.714 --> 11:36.716
but maybe this is not the way.

11:36.716 --> 11:38.351
This is exactly the way.

11:38.351 --> 11:40.620
Hello? Hello!

11:40.620 --> 11:41.821
Oh, it's probably just like Bloomingdale's,

11:41.821 --> 11:43.055
as soon as you find what you need,

11:43.055 --> 11:44.490
then someone shows up to help you.

11:44.490 --> 11:45.892
Ohh.

11:45.892 --> 11:48.828
Please, I need a friend.

11:48.828 --> 11:50.663
Oof. Pass.

11:50.663 --> 11:53.032
â™ª

11:53.032 --> 11:54.934
This one goes out to my favorite captain,

11:54.934 --> 11:57.003
Captain Crunch.

11:57.003 --> 11:59.805
(poorly playing "Taps")

11:59.805 --> 12:02.508
"Coven" was perfect.
"Coven" was a lot of fun.

12:02.508 --> 12:03.743
Emma Roberts didn't even

12:03.743 --> 12:05.411
bother me in "Coven."

12:05.411 --> 12:07.513
You know what my triggers are?

12:07.513 --> 12:09.482
Sugar,

12:09.482 --> 12:11.984
um, I try not to Google my exes.

12:11.984 --> 12:14.554
("Taps" continues)

12:14.554 --> 12:16.389
Do you even know what brunch is?

12:16.389 --> 12:17.490
Do you guys have brunch?

12:17.490 --> 12:18.958
Do soldiers have brunch?

12:18.958 --> 12:22.428
("Taps" continues)

12:22.428 --> 12:23.796
Phew!

12:23.796 --> 12:24.997
"Taps"!

12:24.997 --> 12:26.065
I don't mind walking in circles,

12:26.065 --> 12:27.433
but that's what we're doing.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.068
We're not walking in a circle.

12:29.068 --> 12:31.404
Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

12:31.404 --> 12:32.638
What do you think you're doing?

12:32.638 --> 12:33.773
Listen, I'm gonna level with you.

12:33.773 --> 12:35.508
Okay, I need to meet a veteran

12:35.508 --> 12:37.343
so I can take him to a party

12:37.343 --> 12:38.844
and make my mother's surrogate daughter...

12:38.844 --> 12:40.746
this bitch Nicole who's got eyes

12:40.746 --> 12:42.848
like fucking swimming pools...

12:42.848 --> 12:44.050
I need to make her angry

12:44.050 --> 12:45.818
with this veteran friend.

12:45.818 --> 12:47.486
Out.

12:50.356 --> 12:51.724
- Thank you.
- Why are you thanking her?

12:51.724 --> 12:54.460
- I love you.
- I don't care.

12:54.460 --> 12:55.962
All right, I really wish
I could see you more,

12:55.962 --> 12:57.330
you know?

12:57.330 --> 12:58.564
No more funeral talk, I swear.

12:58.564 --> 12:59.899
You know, you don't have to come

12:59.899 --> 13:01.634
all the way out here, I can go to you.

13:01.634 --> 13:03.502
Okay, yeah. That'd be great.

13:03.502 --> 13:04.937
- Good idea, Garry.
- You know, we don't have

13:04.937 --> 13:06.639
to go to a gay club or anything like that.

13:06.639 --> 13:09.408
I mean, we could...

13:09.408 --> 13:10.743
I was not planning on taking you

13:10.743 --> 13:12.078
to a gay club.

13:12.078 --> 13:13.713
Well, I would if you wanted to.

13:13.713 --> 13:15.081
Maybe we should do that.

13:15.081 --> 13:16.515
I think Rachel would love...

13:16.515 --> 13:18.417
- ... the Flaming Saddle.
- Or you know what?

13:18.417 --> 13:19.619
I could go to your apartment,

13:19.619 --> 13:20.920
we could have a movie night.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.421
Remember when we were kids

13:22.421 --> 13:23.623
how much fun we had doing movie nights?

13:23.623 --> 13:25.458
- I do, I do.
- You had your tapes,

13:25.458 --> 13:28.561
you had "Mannequin" and "Big Business."

13:28.561 --> 13:29.662
You loved "Mannequin."

13:29.662 --> 13:31.731
R.I.P., Meshach Taylor.

13:31.731 --> 13:34.433
Yeah, and I had "Shoah" and "Fiddler."

13:34.433 --> 13:35.768
Well, you always had a soft spot

13:35.768 --> 13:36.836
for Topol.

13:36.836 --> 13:38.471
- I did.
- We could agree on that.

13:38.471 --> 13:39.839
Yes, and you know what else?

13:39.839 --> 13:41.407
"Born on the Fourth of July."

13:41.407 --> 13:42.508
That's right.

13:42.508 --> 13:44.010
- You remember that?
- Yes.

13:44.010 --> 13:46.412
"We're never, never gonna let the people

13:46.412 --> 13:49.415
of the United States forget that war!"

13:52.485 --> 13:54.020
All right, I'll call you, Garry.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.621
Okay. All right.

13:55.621 --> 13:58.424
â™ª

13:58.424 --> 14:00.326
I feel like I need two weeks of recovery

14:00.326 --> 14:02.294
for every day I spend with my family.

14:02.294 --> 14:03.663
Family is like religion, it's just

14:03.663 --> 14:05.064
for when you're dying or getting married.

14:05.064 --> 14:07.333
Any other time is just superfluous.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.968
This month on HBO:

14:08.968 --> 14:10.903
From producers Tom Hanks,

14:10.903 --> 14:12.371
Steven Spielberg,

14:12.371 --> 14:14.607
and Steven "Little Steven" Van Zandt,

14:14.607 --> 14:17.410
comes the true story of Stanley Pilburn,

14:17.410 --> 14:18.978
a World War II soldier

14:18.978 --> 14:22.048
who put six other
soldiers' lives above his.

14:22.048 --> 14:23.082
Wow. Now there's

14:23.082 --> 14:24.550
an impressive veteran friend.

14:24.550 --> 14:26.052
Yeah, where was that guy last night?

14:26.052 --> 14:28.087
Wait a minute. Didn't you say your agent

14:28.087 --> 14:29.855
was friends with someone at HBO?

14:29.855 --> 14:31.624
Yeah.

14:31.624 --> 14:33.759
Oh, maybe he can get us
into that premiere party.

14:33.759 --> 14:37.759
â™ª

14:38.698 --> 14:40.433
I don't know a single person at this party

14:40.433 --> 14:41.867
and I have never felt more at home.

14:41.867 --> 14:43.069
There's the cast of "Getting On."

14:43.069 --> 14:44.904
We have to say hi to Niecy Nash.

14:44.904 --> 14:45.871
Oh, and it's Little Steven.

14:45.871 --> 14:47.373
- Where?
- Little Steven.

14:47.373 --> 14:48.841
- Look, between those two.
- Oh my God.

14:48.841 --> 14:50.309
He's wearing his luxury bandana.

14:50.309 --> 14:51.944
- What a class act.
- I love him.

14:51.944 --> 14:53.846
Have you seen Stanley Pilburn anywhere yet?

14:53.846 --> 14:55.848
No. But, I mean, you know, he'll come.

14:55.848 --> 14:57.016
He's the guest of honor.

14:57.016 --> 14:58.384
God, I can't wait to show up

14:58.384 --> 14:59.752
to Nicole's graduation party

14:59.752 --> 15:01.353
and see her stupid face

15:01.353 --> 15:03.456
when she sees that I'm
not only with a veteran,

15:03.456 --> 15:04.690
I'm with a famous veteran.

15:04.690 --> 15:05.958
Oh, hold on.

15:05.958 --> 15:06.859
That guy's Cab Culver,

15:06.859 --> 15:08.060
he works at HBO.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.495
He knows my agent, let's say hi.

15:09.495 --> 15:11.497
- Excuse me.
- Excuse us.

15:11.497 --> 15:13.399
Hey. Cab Culver, right?

15:13.399 --> 15:15.367
You work at HBO? I'm Billy Epstein.

15:15.367 --> 15:16.535
My agent Skippy Truce mentioned

15:16.535 --> 15:17.603
that you guys were friends.

15:17.603 --> 15:18.537
Oh yeah, Skippy.

15:18.537 --> 15:19.939
Yes, exactly.

15:19.939 --> 15:21.941
It's the agent that's not Jewish.

15:21.941 --> 15:23.809
Oh, this is my colleague Marcy Stein.

15:23.809 --> 15:24.810
- Hi!
- Hello!

15:24.810 --> 15:26.879
Nice to meet you.

15:29.048 --> 15:31.350
So, we know who we are, who are you?

15:31.350 --> 15:32.585
I'm a comedian with an agent.

15:32.585 --> 15:34.553
I write recaps on the internet.

15:35.955 --> 15:38.357
Great meeting you.

15:39.992 --> 15:41.494
Nice to meet you too.

15:41.494 --> 15:44.830
Yes, they seem like very warm people.

15:44.830 --> 15:46.499
No, very nice.

15:46.499 --> 15:47.800
And by the way, when did HBO

15:47.800 --> 15:49.401
stop making comedies

15:49.401 --> 15:51.904
and only start making
gently funny comedies?

15:51.904 --> 15:53.339
Oh, and while we have your attention,

15:53.339 --> 15:54.774
can I just say, is there any way

15:54.774 --> 15:56.542
we could give Ricky Gervais another show?

15:56.542 --> 15:57.610
Yes, is it true that your slogan now

15:57.610 --> 15:58.811
is "It's not TV,

15:58.811 --> 16:00.813
let's give Ricky Gervais more chances."

16:00.813 --> 16:02.548
Oh, and remember that really cute story

16:02.548 --> 16:03.816
where you guys accidentally turned down

16:03.816 --> 16:05.417
"Breaking Bad" and "Mad Men"?

16:05.417 --> 16:06.685
And then turned around and made

16:06.685 --> 16:08.487
"John From Cincinnati."

16:08.487 --> 16:09.421
Please give us a show.

16:09.421 --> 16:10.556
Give us a show, please.

16:10.556 --> 16:11.891
Anyone, anyone in this party,

16:11.891 --> 16:12.992
please give us a show.

16:12.992 --> 16:13.726
Please give us a show.

16:13.726 --> 16:15.027
Ah! Billy, look!

16:15.027 --> 16:16.028
It's Private Pilburn,
right by the restrooms.

16:16.028 --> 16:17.496
Oh, perfect.

16:17.496 --> 16:19.298
You go do that, I'll get more champagne.

16:19.298 --> 16:20.533
Good luck.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.401
â™ª

16:22.401 --> 16:24.336
Private Pilburn, I am such a fan

16:24.336 --> 16:25.037
of your work.

16:25.037 --> 16:26.872
Aren't you kind?

16:26.872 --> 16:28.107
My name is Julie

16:28.107 --> 16:30.342
and I respect veterans.

16:30.342 --> 16:32.478
In fact, Gary Sinise and I

16:32.478 --> 16:33.979
have a contest every year to see

16:33.979 --> 16:35.381
who respects veterans more

16:35.381 --> 16:37.750
and every time we just tie

16:37.750 --> 16:40.519
because we love our nation's veterans.

16:40.519 --> 16:41.921
Oh, thank you.

16:41.921 --> 16:44.657
It's nice to know that your generation

16:44.657 --> 16:46.892
appreciates the freedoms

16:46.892 --> 16:48.294
we fought for.

16:48.294 --> 16:50.629
Absolutely. And in gratitude,

16:50.629 --> 16:52.731
I was wondering if you
would do me the honor

16:52.731 --> 16:54.567
of being my special guest

16:54.567 --> 16:56.669
at a graduation party.

16:56.669 --> 16:58.504
You and me?

16:58.504 --> 16:59.338
At a party?

16:59.338 --> 17:00.406
Yes.

17:00.406 --> 17:01.974
Oh, why, yes.

17:01.974 --> 17:04.810
Oh! Private Pilburn,

17:04.810 --> 17:06.912
you've made my night, sir.

17:06.912 --> 17:08.414
And may I say also,

17:08.414 --> 17:10.449
thank you for your service.

17:10.449 --> 17:11.617
I tell you what.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.419
Let's skip the party,

17:13.419 --> 17:15.820
walk over to the restroom,

17:15.820 --> 17:18.089
you can service me there.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.625
What?

17:19.625 --> 17:22.728
You remind me of Maureen O'Hara.

17:22.728 --> 17:25.631
I always wanted her to suck me off.

17:25.631 --> 17:26.932
Billy!

17:26.932 --> 17:29.735
This veteran is disgusting.

17:29.735 --> 17:32.838
Hey, hey, hey, what did I say, huh?

17:34.592 --> 17:36.060
You don't have to kick us out

17:36.060 --> 17:37.562
of the party, that man's a pervert.

17:37.562 --> 17:38.563
No, the "Getting On" girl.

17:38.563 --> 17:39.664
"Getting On" girl!

17:39.664 --> 17:40.965
- "Getting On"!
- Niecy Nash!

17:40.965 --> 17:42.366
"Getting On," we love you!

17:42.366 --> 17:44.702
Laurie Metcalf, "MADtv," "MADtv"!

17:44.702 --> 17:46.337
All right, we're going.

17:46.337 --> 17:48.372
- They're comics or something.
- They're nobody.

17:48.372 --> 17:49.407
Fine, you don't have to touch us.

17:49.407 --> 17:50.441
I'm getting gift bags.

17:50.441 --> 17:52.043
- No, excuse me.
- Let him get...

17:52.043 --> 17:54.212
I'm getting gift bags!

17:55.980 --> 17:57.515
I'm coming up the stairs!

17:57.515 --> 17:59.183
I know how to walk up stairs!

18:00.284 --> 18:01.352
How many parties have we been

18:01.352 --> 18:03.321
kicked out of now?

18:03.321 --> 18:04.956
What am I gonna do?

18:04.956 --> 18:06.224
Nicole's graduation party

18:06.224 --> 18:07.492
is in less than 24 hours

18:07.492 --> 18:09.026
and I haven't met a single veteran

18:09.026 --> 18:10.027
that I could use to make her look

18:10.027 --> 18:11.262
like an asshole.

18:11.262 --> 18:12.530
Well, maybe don't go to the party.

18:12.530 --> 18:14.966
Just once I wanted to show up Nicole

18:14.966 --> 18:17.068
and prove to her that
I'm the better person,

18:17.068 --> 18:18.970
even if that is a total lie.

18:20.204 --> 18:22.206
This is really important to you?

18:22.206 --> 18:23.407
Yes.

18:23.407 --> 18:27.011
Yes it is.

18:27.011 --> 18:30.081
What?

18:30.081 --> 18:31.549
You wanna go see "On The Town" again?

18:31.549 --> 18:33.584
I know someone who cleans their costumes.

18:33.584 --> 18:37.488
â™ª

18:37.488 --> 18:39.624
Okay, so you can have
as much food as you want.

18:39.624 --> 18:41.158
I don't know what's Kosher or not,

18:41.158 --> 18:43.327
and, um, if Nicole asks,

18:43.327 --> 18:45.062
you've been to battle, okay?

18:45.062 --> 18:46.297
- Okay.
- And by the way, Garry,

18:46.297 --> 18:48.199
thank you so much for doing this.

18:48.199 --> 18:49.233
You look great.

18:49.233 --> 18:50.401
Aw, I'm so happy to be here.

18:50.401 --> 18:52.236
Uh, excuse me, everyone.

18:52.236 --> 18:54.272
Uh, hi.

18:54.272 --> 18:56.107
Uh, I just want to thank all of you

18:56.107 --> 18:58.376
for coming to my graduation party.

18:58.376 --> 19:00.511
But most of all, I want to thank

19:00.511 --> 19:03.047
the mom I never had,

19:03.047 --> 19:05.182
Marilyn Kessler.

19:05.182 --> 19:08.052
I cannot wait to follow in your footsteps.

19:08.052 --> 19:10.321
Well, you can try, but I have tiny feet.

19:10.321 --> 19:11.689
Tiny, tiny!

19:11.689 --> 19:13.324
That's so cute.

19:13.324 --> 19:15.593
Julie, would you like to say

19:15.593 --> 19:18.396
a few words about your mom?

19:18.396 --> 19:20.264
Sure, yeah, thank you.

19:20.264 --> 19:22.133
Thanks, Mom.

19:22.133 --> 19:24.035
Uh, thank you, Nicole.

19:24.035 --> 19:25.169
Okay. No, I know where to stand,

19:25.169 --> 19:26.437
thanks, Nicole.

19:26.437 --> 19:28.906
Um, I just wanted to say that today

19:28.906 --> 19:30.408
isn't about us.

19:30.408 --> 19:32.043
It's about our troops,

19:32.043 --> 19:33.644
it's about our veterans,

19:33.644 --> 19:35.446
and it's about how they fought

19:35.446 --> 19:37.081
for our freedoms.

19:37.081 --> 19:40.017
So, please join me in boycotting

19:40.017 --> 19:41.886
Bernie's Bootcamp!

19:41.886 --> 19:43.087
Thank you.

19:43.087 --> 19:46.457
And for a few words about that,

19:46.457 --> 19:48.192
and our country,

19:48.192 --> 19:50.361
I wanna bring to the stage right now

19:50.361 --> 19:54.465
my best friend Sergeant Garry Epstein,

19:54.465 --> 19:57.201
who's a veteran!

19:57.201 --> 19:59.036
(microphone feedback)

19:59.036 --> 20:02.974
Thank you. At ease.

20:02.974 --> 20:06.010
We are never, never gonna let the people

20:06.010 --> 20:08.112
of the United States forget that war!

20:08.112 --> 20:09.614
"Born on the Fourth of July."

20:09.614 --> 20:12.149
Because the moment we do,

20:12.149 --> 20:14.018
there's gonna be another war,

20:14.018 --> 20:15.353
and another,

20:15.353 --> 20:17.021
and another.

20:17.021 --> 20:19.557
I would like to say one more thing.

20:19.557 --> 20:21.359
I have a gay brother

20:21.359 --> 20:23.060
and I am not ashamed.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.228
So let's end this whole

20:24.228 --> 20:25.363
"Don't ask, don't tell" thing.

20:25.363 --> 20:27.431
Thank you very much.

20:27.431 --> 20:29.100
Okay, thank you.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.169
Uh, everyone enjoy the party.

20:32.169 --> 20:33.704
(chuckling)

20:33.704 --> 20:35.906
- Huh?
- Uh, it was great.

20:35.906 --> 20:37.241
- Thank you.
- I think I got bitten

20:37.241 --> 20:38.542
by that show biz bug.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.077
Well, you know what they say:

20:40.077 --> 20:41.479
friends and families come and go

20:41.479 --> 20:43.147
but show business is forever.

20:43.147 --> 20:45.016
Forever and ever.

20:45.016 --> 20:46.617
Oh, speaking of which,

20:46.617 --> 20:47.585
my agent, gotta go.

20:47.585 --> 20:48.686
I love this guy.

20:48.686 --> 20:50.021
He calls Billy on a Sunday,

20:50.021 --> 20:51.188
he reaches out on Yom Kippur.

20:51.188 --> 20:52.556
Once he texts him on Ramadan,

20:52.556 --> 20:54.558
I'm gonna make him put a ring on it.

20:54.558 --> 20:55.993
- Sweetheart.
- Hi Mom.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.094
I can't wait to throw you

20:57.094 --> 20:58.629
a graduation party

20:58.629 --> 21:00.197
or a wedding

21:00.197 --> 21:01.432
or a baby shower.

21:01.432 --> 21:03.234
I know you mean well, but

21:03.234 --> 21:05.102
that really hurts my feelings.

21:05.102 --> 21:06.637
What if I went blonde?

21:06.637 --> 21:07.938
Now, I'm not talking about anything

21:07.938 --> 21:09.006
age inappropriate,

21:09.006 --> 21:10.107
I'm just talking about something

21:10.107 --> 21:11.609
to give me a little lift.

21:11.609 --> 21:13.110
- Billy, what's wrong?
- My agent

21:13.110 --> 21:14.578
committed suicide this morning.

21:14.578 --> 21:18.282
- He what?
- You have an agent?

21:18.282 --> 21:20.418
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

21:20.418 --> 21:21.619
Don't worry, Billy.

21:21.619 --> 21:23.154
It probably has nothing to do with you.

21:23.154 --> 21:24.388
Oh, well, thanks for

21:24.388 --> 21:25.623
the grief counseling, Marilyn.

21:25.623 --> 21:27.425
Well, if you wanna talk any more about it,

21:27.425 --> 21:28.693
you know where to reach me.

21:28.693 --> 21:30.327
Julie has my number.

21:30.327 --> 21:33.130
â™ª

21:33.130 --> 21:34.298
I gotta say, Billy,

21:34.298 --> 21:36.333
after the events of today,

21:36.333 --> 21:37.668
life is short, you know?

21:37.668 --> 21:40.104
(sighs)

21:40.104 --> 21:42.106
Don't spend too much
of it with your family.

21:42.106 --> 21:43.374
This is getting too real.

21:43.374 --> 21:44.575
Wanna duck out of here and see that

21:44.575 --> 21:45.976
new Rachel McAdams movie?

21:45.976 --> 21:47.011
It's supposed to be terrible.

21:47.011 --> 21:49.346
The worst.

21:49.346 --> 21:52.183
Excuse us. Pardon us.

21:52.183 --> 21:54.985
I am so glad we survived that party.

21:54.985 --> 21:57.321
You know, in a way, we're veterans.

21:57.321 --> 21:58.389
Yes.

22:01.292 --> 22:03.227
So ends a week

22:03.227 --> 22:04.462
of family awfulness.

22:04.462 --> 22:05.296
You're my family.

22:05.296 --> 22:06.330
You're my family!

22:06.330 --> 22:07.331
