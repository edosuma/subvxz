00:06.960 --> 00:08.246
Hello?

00:10.080 --> 00:12.128
Can anyone hear me?

00:13.840 --> 00:16.047
This is unbelievable.

00:16.160 --> 00:20.131
There are 7,000 people watching this
stream, and it's working flawlessly.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.801
Rebuffering events are below 0.5%.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.360
Even when his sobbing
shakes the camera,

00:25.440 --> 00:26.601
there's no blocking at all.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.045
I mean, the quality is great.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.167
Why?

00:29.280 --> 00:31.203
More good news. There's a storm coming.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.328
There's no way the EMS guys
can get up there.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.129
This could go on all day.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.168
Appreciate your cooperation
here, gentlemen.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.285
We'll see you this afternoon.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.291
Richard, I'm sorry about that.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.084
Oh, no, it's fine.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.928
The lead counsel of the company
that's suing us

00:51.000 --> 00:52.525
just marched their engineer
through the house

00:52.600 --> 00:56.082
to make sure the platform they want
to seize is ready for them.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.601
Felt great.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.690
It's like they assume they've already won.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.083
Is there any chance they haven't?

01:02.160 --> 01:03.764
God damn it, Richard!

01:03.840 --> 01:07.561
In addition to stealing
two of my four-packs of Fage yogurt,

01:07.640 --> 01:09.927
your ship-jumping coder cunts

01:10.000 --> 01:13.288
happened to walk off with the rest
of our toilet paper, so that...

01:13.360 --> 01:14.361
Hmm.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.845
Speaking of shit that can't be
wiped away and flushed,

01:19.960 --> 01:21.644
how are you, Mr. Mohanahan?

01:21.800 --> 01:22.926
Morning, Mr. Bachman.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.644
I don't suppose you have
anything to say to me

01:24.720 --> 01:26.085
by way of an apology?

01:26.760 --> 01:28.842
- For?
- For the embarrassing ordeal

01:28.920 --> 01:32.163
that you put me through yesterday
in front of over nine people.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.643
I think you should be the one
apologizing, Mr. Bachman.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.167
You lost your composure
and ruined our entire case.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.089
I'll see you gentlemen at 3:00.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.208
I shan't be attending, out of contempt,

01:44.280 --> 01:46.362
so this will have to serve as our goodbye.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.690
Don't let the door hit
ya where God split ya.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.046
- I'm sorry.
- No.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.527
- Richard, I'll see you there?
- Yeah.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.886
Uh, Pete?

01:57.760 --> 01:59.410
Do we have any chance of winning this?

02:00.240 --> 02:04.609
When you hired me, I told you I
would never lie to you, Richard.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.690
Yeah, that's true. You did.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.525
I'll see you at 3:00.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.162
- Oh, hello, neighbor.
- Neighbor.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.531
Not for long. Louise
helped me sell my house.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.009
The ferret laws are
much more enlightened in Arizona.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.844
Arizona, huh?

02:39.920 --> 02:41.081
You'll be dead in a month.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.249
We'll miss you.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.367
This your home?

02:44.440 --> 02:45.441
Indeed it is.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.530
Are you interested in selling?
It's a great time.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.171
Not interested.
There are people in there who depend on me,

02:51.240 --> 02:54.528
human people, not weasel animals.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.806
It's a ferret.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.086
- Weasels.
- Ferrets!

02:57.160 --> 02:59.527
Corner lot, good square footage,

02:59.600 --> 03:02.922
I could probably get you
a lot more than I got Noah.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.963
How much did you get him?

03:06.280 --> 03:08.681
Wait. You're selling the
house just like that?

03:08.760 --> 03:11.684
It wasn't a rash decision.
I agonized over it.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.441
- But what about your incubator?
- What about it, Jared?

03:14.520 --> 03:16.249
Pied Piper has caked its pants,

03:16.320 --> 03:19.927
Jian Yang's chances of investment
have literally gone up in smoke,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.401
and you heard what Monahan said
in court yesterday.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.485
Market forces and random events
have conspired against me

03:25.600 --> 03:28.922
to make the success of my incubator
all but impossible.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.562
Functionally, all I've really achieved is
running a flop house where guys have shat,

03:33.640 --> 03:35.961
jerked off and paid me no rent.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.606
MAN". Why won't anyone come get me?

03:37.680 --> 03:39.728
Well, we have accomplished one other thing.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.689
We're up over 20,000 viewers.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.489
Holy shit. Really?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.165
Yeah, Buzzfeed linked to us.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.890
Now we're picking up on Reddit.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.930
This guy falling off a cliff
is the first good luck we've had.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.326
And right as we're gaining traction,

03:51.400 --> 03:54.244
we have to hand it all over
to Gavin fucking Belson.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.129
This is fucked.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.402
We can't give it to him

03:58.480 --> 04:00.084
if we don't have it to give.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.401
What do you mean?

04:03.480 --> 04:05.960
We do have it to give,
and we have to give it.

04:06.040 --> 04:11.171
100% of what he's trying to take from us
exists digitally on servers in this house.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.323
If we nuke them,
there's nothing for him to seize.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.880
As far as he knows, it's an accident.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.325
No one would believe that.

04:18.399 --> 04:23.850
Two weeks ago, we accidentally erased
one-third of Intersite's entire library.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.527
I think we've established our ineptitude
beyond a reasonable doubt.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.450
Fuck it.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.931
I say we delete everything.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.361
No.No.No.No.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.726
Guys, that's not what we do.
We don't destroy things.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.564
Not on purpose, anyway.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.291
Right? Isn't that the whole reason
why you got into this in the first place,

04:41.360 --> 04:43.203
to build cool shit?

04:43.600 --> 04:46.649
I mean, look at that livestream.
It's fucking perfect.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.808
And even if Hooli ends up owning it,

04:50.880 --> 04:53.645
we built it, with no resources

04:53.720 --> 04:57.122
and a fucking stream of endless obstacles.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.931
I don't know, I mean,
I kind of want to see how big it can get,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.322
right up until the point where Gavin Belson
has to fucking take it from us.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.166
Guys, who is Manny Pa-qui-oh?

05:07.240 --> 05:10.642
Pacquiao? He's one of the most famous
people on the planet Earth.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.326
Oh! Manny Pacquiao, the
Filipino legislator.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.761
No, boxer.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.161
Okay, well, he just tweeted
a link to our livestream.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.368
And he has almost two million followers.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.286
Oh, fuck.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.681
Oh, fuck.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.041
We got to scale up if we're going
to handle that kind of traffic.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.326
I'm gonna compress the manifests.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.164
I'll kill the highest bitrate
to give us more headroom.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.171
I've always wanted to be
part of a suicide pact.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.083
- What?
- That's not what we're doing.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.691
Hey, Gilfoyle, we're up to 50,000 views.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.525
Whoa. It is, like, 500 degrees in here.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.007
Yeah. Anton is really starting to sweat.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.686
Yeah, I still can't believe
you gave the servers a man's name.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.127
Sorry, I couldn't remember
your mother's name.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.168
Hey, why don't I just open up
the garage door?

05:52.240 --> 05:53.446
Let some fresh air in here.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.126
Yeah, sure, if you want
the cooling system to shut down

05:56.200 --> 05:57.690
and everything in here to turn to magma.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.764
Actually, with all the new servers
I have running,

06:00.880 --> 06:03.611
we're about to max out the amperage
and blow the main breaker anyway.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.002
Sooner or later, Gilfoyle's servers
are gonna fail, and then it's all done.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.248
My servers can handle 10 times the traffic

06:09.320 --> 06:12.051
if they weren't busy
apologizing for your shit codebase.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.805
Oh, yeah? Well, my codebase
could handle this traffic,

06:14.880 --> 06:16.723
fuck your mother,
make a video of it, upload it,

06:16.800 --> 06:19.041
- and even that video would not rebuffer.
- Hey, Pete.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.125
Hey, I just heard from the judge.
He's gonna call us in an hour early.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.964
Early? What does that mean?

06:25.280 --> 06:27.567
Well, it's either a very
good or a very bad sign.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.281
Well, actually, it's almost always bad.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.329
I take it back. It's a bad thing.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.481
Why don't you head over,
I'll see you when you get there, okay?

06:37.920 --> 06:40.526
Hey. guys, I gotta go.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.967
It's time.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.008
Try to keep it online
as long as you can, okay?

06:48.320 --> 06:49.321
Why?

06:49.400 --> 06:52.563
- The picture quality is remarkable.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:52.680 --> 06:58.483
And this is all hosted at a data center
they built themselves in their garage.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.164
- Please help me.
- That's right.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.248
- Very impressive.
- Please someone help me!

07:02.320 --> 07:05.767
It's already becoming a meme
in the Philippines. Look.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.729
Why won't anyone come help me?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.609
Can anyone hear me?

07:13.680 --> 07:14.681
Hello?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.207
And Filipinos find this amusing?

07:17.280 --> 07:18.611
- Can anyone hear me?
- Apparently.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.603
Please help me.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.124
I've lost all feeling below the waist.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.487
- Why?
- They are a fascinating people.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.561
How are the numbers?

07:30.640 --> 07:34.008
Unless people start getting bored and
tuning out, we're gonna hit our capacity.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.650
Fuck.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.449
MAN". I'm so dehydrated.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.166
I'm gonna have to urinate
into my water bottle.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.641
Uh, this guy's gonna drink his own piss?

07:42.720 --> 07:45.485
That's too good.
We're gonna fail by succeeding.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.848
Jared, I need you
to plug those servers in now.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.046
Aye-aye, captain.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.771
What a shit-circus. Good riddance.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.520
- You're never gonna sell.
- What?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.523
I mean, look what's happening here.
It's magical.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.681
The only thing magical

07:57.760 --> 08:01.128
is how much this house has appreciated
in the last three years, Jared.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.167
I'm selling.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.811
I mean, that's just money.
It has no real value.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.447
It literally defines value.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.124
Look at this check. All right?

08:09.200 --> 08:11.726
You can't actually cash it,
but think about what it represents.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.370
It's priceless.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.091
Jared, I saw your entire HR file.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.605
It was in the Hooli disclosure.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.648
You had a fat salary and stock options.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.087
By now, you would be a senior VP.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.607
But instead, you walked away
to wrangle extension cords

08:25.680 --> 08:28.923
for a company that will be defunct
in maybe 30 hours.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.802
If you're not kicking yourself,
even just a little bit,

08:32.880 --> 08:34.530
you are objectively insane.

08:34.600 --> 08:38.207
I can always find another job,
but look at us doing this.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.965
It's intoxicating.
Don't act like it's not magical.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.081
It is.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.441
What the fuck is that?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.520
Jesus Christ!

08:47.320 --> 08:48.526
What the fucking fuck?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.407
Hey, guys.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.051
On the day that I'm showing the place?
Are you serious?

08:53.120 --> 08:54.884
I had to shorten up the cable run, so...

08:54.960 --> 08:57.008
This is the shortest distance
to the garage. Had to do it.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.806
It's magical.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.201
Huh.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.728
So, start with the wide end.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.481
Oh, Richard.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.529
Here, let me help you with that.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.766
- May I?
- Uh...

09:27.200 --> 09:28.929
- Relax.
- Okay.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.604
Just gonna tie your tie.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.685
All right.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.726
I feel terrible it's come to this, Richard.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.211
But who knows?

09:38.280 --> 09:41.250
Sometimes things like
this are for the best.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.607
I know this one is for me.

09:45.280 --> 09:49.444
If you hadn't
blackmailed me into this arbitration,

09:49.520 --> 09:52.046
I was gonna have to go
in front of the Hooli Board of Directors

09:52.120 --> 09:56.364
and ask for $250 million to buy you out.

09:57.240 --> 10:00.130
Wow. $250 million?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.247
Believe it or not,

10:01.320 --> 10:04.483
your algorithm is the only way
to make Nucleus work.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.370
I was ready to pay whatever it took.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.601
Let me ask you this.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.126
If I offered you 10 million
for Pied Piper right now,

10:11.200 --> 10:14.602
before we even go in
there, would you take it?

10:15.680 --> 10:16.966
Really? You'd do that?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.930
No, of course not.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.241
I'm about to get it for free.
I'm just fucking with you.

10:21.320 --> 10:26.167
I'm sure you'll come up with plenty more
once-in-a-lifetime ideas, Richard.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.561
Or not.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.807
There you go.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.641
Mmm-hmm.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.530
Good luck in there, Richard.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.324
Gilfoyle, what are you doing?

10:45.400 --> 10:46.890
Jamming the breakers so they don't trip.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.002
That's not a huge fucking fire hazard?

10:49.080 --> 10:51.731
Yeah, of course it is. This whole shit box
could go up at any second.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.131
No, no. No. No fires in here.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.487
I already had that conversation
with Jian Yang, I think.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.562
Two hundred thousand views. Fuck!

10:57.640 --> 11:00.723
Gilfoyle, we need to build
the caching mechanisms now!

11:00.800 --> 11:02.643
It's the only way the clusters will scale.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.881
Okay, sounds good. Do it.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.327
I can't do it on my own, Gilfoyle!

11:06.400 --> 11:09.210
Hey, Erlich, I need another coder here!
None of these guys can help me.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.487
Sorry, amigo. I don't code anymore.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.483
Remember? Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.927
Well, then we're fucked.
This thing is gonna crash any second.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.201
Mr. Bachman,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.607
- I am sorry to drop in on you like this...
- Erlich, Seriously!

11:20.680 --> 11:21.966
- ...but I have got the buyers here.
- Shit!

11:22.040 --> 11:23.530
He's gonna drink his own piss!

11:23.920 --> 11:25.445
- Gilfoyle, I need some fucking help!
- Sorry, Louise,

11:25.520 --> 11:28.729
- this isn't a great time. I'm entertaining...
- I told you already, I'm busy!

11:28.800 --> 11:31.804
...and I have some minor cosmetic repairs
to do before I show the house.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.763
Oh, no, they don't even
need to look inside.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.087
They only want the property
for the lot value.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.811
- Seriously, I can't do this by myself!
- Lot value? Meaning?

11:39.120 --> 11:42.329
You have to realize your house
is a total teardown, right?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.565
They want to tear this place down?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.728
Gilfoyle, the caching mechanisms!
We're gonna crash!

11:46.800 --> 11:48.609
I told you, get Erlich to do it.

11:48.680 --> 11:49.886
Richard said keep it online!

11:49.960 --> 11:51.724
- Uh, Mr. Bachman.
- I can't do this by myself!

11:51.800 --> 11:54.406
They want to make an offer
right now, all cash.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.689
Mr. Bachman, I think
you would be foolish to turn this down.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.926
Did you just call me a fool?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.968
- No. All I meant was...
- Madam,

12:04.040 --> 12:07.249
you do not call a man a fool
on the transom of his own home.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.324
A home that happens to be
the world headquarters of a company

12:10.400 --> 12:13.609
keeping streaming video
of a man who's about to drink his own urine

12:13.680 --> 12:16.251
online for tens of thousands of Filipinos.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.607
Does that sound like foolishness to you?

12:18.680 --> 12:22.446
So, you can tell your clients, respectfully,
that they may go fuck themselves.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.766
All right, I'm gonna start compiling
varnish to cache the manifest.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.923
Dinesh, you reduce the seeds
in the P2P swarm, got it?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.126
Let's fucking do this.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.651
I knew you wouldn't sell.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.566
Jared, respectfully, shut the fuck up.
I'm working.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.487
MAN". I don't wanna drink my pee.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.440
What's that smell?

12:54.520 --> 12:58.081
...which I weighed
in making my final decision.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.647
A decision I do not take lightly.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.526
Now, in concerning...

13:06.720 --> 13:09.690
Mr. Hendricks, are you on your phone?

13:10.880 --> 13:11.881
No.

13:13.240 --> 13:17.723
It says, "Aim at the base of the fire."
That's the servers.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.087
If you hit those servers,
you kill our livestream, Jared.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.605
All right. I don't know what to do!

13:21.680 --> 13:25.969
- Maybe we should do verbal SWOT analysis?
- 298,000! 299,000!

13:26.080 --> 13:27.411
Our check is burning!

13:27.480 --> 13:29.482
He's drinking his own urine.
He's drinking his piss.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.164
We're up over 300,000 viewers!

13:31.240 --> 13:34.130
Hello? I'm down here! Hello?

13:34.200 --> 13:35.486
Wait, who the fuck is that guy?

13:35.560 --> 13:37.642
Wait, wait. They're rescuing him.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.530
Why did it take you so long?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.170
Wait. He shut it off.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.971
290, 270... Everyone's leaving.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.371
It's over.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.521
Holy shit.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.644
- We did it.
- We fucking did it.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.609
We stayed online till the end.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.646
Fuck, yeah.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.925
Oh!

14:04.920 --> 14:06.684
I wonder if Richard got to see that.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.891
...which is why I had no recourse

14:10.960 --> 14:15.045
but to rule that, since Mr. Hendricks,
by his own admission,

14:15.120 --> 14:19.205
used Hooli equipment to facilitate
the development of Pied Piper,

14:19.640 --> 14:22.689
then pursuant to California Labor Code,

14:22.760 --> 14:27.971
Hooli has a right to ownership
of Pied Piper's underlying IP.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.723
Congrats.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.484
- Congratulations.
- Well done.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.929
- Very well done.
- Congratulations.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.162
You did a very good job, very impressive.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.210
Richard, I'm sorry.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.645
I really am.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.643
We're now at 78 viewers,
which still seems high.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.688
Like, who's watching a blank screen?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.410
We never went down, gents.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.606
Anton really carried us.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.569
Oh, one, still a weird name,

14:58.640 --> 15:01.291
and two, this was
a win for our software stack.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.125
Your software can choke
on my fat fucking balls.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.486
Guys.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.564
Richard just texted me.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.641
He says delete it.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.571
- What?
- He says,

15:11.680 --> 15:15.127
"We just lost. It's my company.
Delete it all. Now."

15:18.320 --> 15:19.810
Motherfucker.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.370
Now, Pied Piper, you conceded
on all of these minor counts.

15:24.440 --> 15:28.411
Accordingly, on the count
of wrongful solicitation,

15:28.480 --> 15:32.883
I find Richard Hendricks did indeed
breach his contract with Hooli

15:32.960 --> 15:37.329
when he hired away a Hooli employee,
one Donald Dunn,

15:37.400 --> 15:41.644
AKA Jared, AKA O.J., apparently.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.610
But this is where things get interesting.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.606
Mr. Belson, there is
language in this contract

15:49.680 --> 15:53.207
that the California Supreme Court
has deemed unlawful.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.684
Preventing Mr. Dunn
from seeking employment elsewhere

15:56.760 --> 15:59.843
is a violation of his rights.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.490
Are you aware of this?

16:01.960 --> 16:05.009
I was not, but I'm willing
to drop that count altogether

16:05.080 --> 16:06.241
if it makes things easier.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.643
Well, here's the thing.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.042
This clause was unlawful

16:12.120 --> 16:16.648
when you included it
in Mr. Hendricks' employment agreement.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.530
Right. As I said,
I'm willing to just move past this.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.001
See, again, I don't think you understand.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.163
If Mr. Hendricks hadn't hired Mr. Dunn,

16:25.240 --> 16:28.847
or you hadn't pursued him for that hire,

16:28.920 --> 16:31.685
I'm not sure I would've
noticed the violation.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.280
But you did, so I did.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.681
What's happening?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.125
Justice, baby.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.282
And what I find is,

16:39.360 --> 16:42.170
this is an unenforceable contract.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.969
It is null and void.

16:44.040 --> 16:49.524
So, effectively, Mr. Hendricks never had
a valid employment agreement with Hooli.

16:49.600 --> 16:55.767
As a result, Hooli has no claim
to ownership of Pied Piper's underlying IP.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.888
That is my ruling.

16:59.080 --> 17:03.961
And per your arbitration agreement,
it is binding and final.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.804
Thank you, everyone.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.049
What the fuck just happened? We lost?
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

17:15.119 --> 17:18.044
We won. We won, right?
I mean, Pied Piper is ours?

17:20.800 --> 17:23.166
Richard, not long ago,

17:23.240 --> 17:25.891
emergency workers
pulled me out of the flaming wreckage

17:25.960 --> 17:27.962
- of my Mercury Grand Marquis.
- All right.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.570
Today, you pulled me out of
the flaming wreckage of my life,

17:31.640 --> 17:33.290
and those flames burn far hotter.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.646
- Sure.
- For that, I thank you.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.721
Yeah, you're welcome.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.326
I used to take a tampon,
soak it in grain alcohol,

17:38.400 --> 17:40.323
and stick it up into my rectum.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.765
That got me high, Richard,

17:41.840 --> 17:44.650
but not half as high
as the drug you just gave me.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.085
You know what that drug's called?

17:46.880 --> 17:47.961
No.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.366
A second chance.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.568
Right on. Uh...

17:52.640 --> 17:54.210
Well, thank you. You did great.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.000
Great job.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.290
Wow! I mean, I totally thought
we were gonna lose that.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.169
I actually told the guys to...

18:03.200 --> 18:04.725
Oh, my God.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.804
All right, I just wrote a mod of DBAN.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.726
As soon as we run it,
it will delete the entire code repository.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.690
Pied Piper will literally vanish.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.365
Wait, what? What?

18:18.560 --> 18:20.289
No. No, no, no. Fuck!

18:21.680 --> 18:22.681
Ah...

18:23.360 --> 18:25.124
Are we sure we have to do this?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.770
You read the text, Jared.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.605
If anything had changed,
Richard would have called by now. Right?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.170
Shit, no! God damn it.

18:39.800 --> 18:44.567
So all you have to do is press that button,
and the entire platform's obliterated.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.371
And no one will ever be able to recover it.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.960
Yep, one click and poof.

18:50.040 --> 18:54.568
"The power to destroy a thing
is the absolute control over it."

18:55.320 --> 18:57.561
Frank Herbert, Dune.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.767
All right then. Here we go.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.082
Three, two, one...

19:05.160 --> 19:06.321
Wait, wait.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.290
Shouldn't we drink
one last toast to Pied Piper

19:09.360 --> 19:11.567
before we burn it to the fucking ground?

19:11.640 --> 19:14.644
All right. As long as God
isn't involved and there's beer.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.290
Okay. Okay.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.409
But if we're claiming
this happened before the ruling,

19:19.480 --> 19:20.766
we should do it quickly.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.321
Damn. Hey, I need to use your phone.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.050
Sorry, I can only allow that for customers.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.122
I'm just gonna use it.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.247
Oh, shit.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.924
I don't know any of their numbers.
They're all on my phone.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.805
God damn it! Fuck!

19:36.200 --> 19:38.851
I need to use your phone to email my friend
so he doesn't delete Pied Piper.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.081
Please.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.125
Bus? Okay.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.486
To Pied Piper.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.521
Wait, is this a wheat beer?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.284
I can't drink this without a lemon.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.044
Noah's got a lemon tree.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.690
Fuck him over one last time?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.762
Okay, but then we're...

19:56.880 --> 19:58.450
- Then we're gonna do it.
- Yeah.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.249
Thank you so much
for letting me use your phone.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.882
Just one email and I'm done, I swear.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.043
As long as you don't shit, piss,
or puke on my bus, it's all good.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.640
Okay.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.645
I hope it's not weird that
the email's coming from your account.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.646
I did not know lemon trees had thorns.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.085
Wait.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.322
This one has like a bruise on it.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.801
Hmm.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.243
No response. Nothing.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.851
Fuck.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.451
Hey, thanks.

20:34.520 --> 20:37.091
Don't get that shitty one.
Get that nice one up there.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.243
Yeah, I think the ferrets have
nibbled some of the lower ones.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.248
Okay, there's no way
I could have squirted this lemon

20:48.320 --> 20:50.243
in your eye on purpose from this distance.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.970
I'm not a fucking lemon sniper.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.691
You'd be more of a lemon suicide bomber.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.603
- Guys. Guys!
- It's Richard.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.682
Why is he knocking? He has my keys.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.171
We need to delete it before he comes in.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.321
Let me in!

21:01.400 --> 21:03.084
Richard. Richard.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.811
Don't delete it.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.685
Did you delete it?

21:09.360 --> 21:10.361
Oops.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.808
Oops? What does that mean, "Oops"?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.449
You said "delete."

21:15.520 --> 21:16.521
Fuck.

21:16.920 --> 21:17.967
Oh, wait.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.286
- Hold on.
- What?

21:21.360 --> 21:22.600
Gilfoyle, what's happening? What?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.971
That's weird. Kernel panic.
The whole system just crashed.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.044
So, what does that mean?
Did you delete Pied Piper or not?

21:29.640 --> 21:31.688
- NOpe_"

21:31.760 --> 21:33.330
We definitely did not.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.164
All thanks to Dinesh's garbage code.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.722
The software you wrote
to delete our software just shit the bed.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.689
- No surprise.
- No, my software's fine.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.171
It's 'cause it's running
on your shit hardware.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.244
My hardware handled
everything else just fine...

21:47.320 --> 21:49.129
- It caught fucking fire!
- ...until your shit software

21:49.200 --> 21:50.645
spread like a virus and killed it.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.846
- Restart it! Restart it!
- I will restart it.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.764
No, no, no, don't restart it.
Don't restart it.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.081
We won.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.810
- We won?
- We won?

21:59.920 --> 22:03.845
Yeah, we beat Gavin Belson, and we won.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.001
Holy shit.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.961
We won.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.163
What the fuck happened here?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.321
Magic.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.129
Gilfoyle's shit hardware caught fire.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.487
No, 'cause your shit software
was slowing it down.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.528
And then Erlich coded
and it gave me chills.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.443
Gilfoyle made a hole in the wall.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.521
- Look!
- I did.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.761
It was frightening.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.848
Did you hear he just lost
the Pied Piper suit?

22:29.920 --> 22:32.969
That's nothing. They're saying
half of all Hooli employment agreements

22:33.080 --> 22:35.242
may be legally invalid.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.288
You don't think
the board will get rid of him, do you?

22:37.360 --> 22:38.771
Maybe.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.649
- Two, please.
- Sure, coming right up.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.850
I'm hearing a lot of chatter
about that Nelson Bighetti guy over at XYZ.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.843
I mean, three promotions in a year?

22:46.920 --> 22:49.730
President of Hooli Cancer
and AIDS societies?

22:49.800 --> 22:51.450
That doesn't just happen.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.769
He must be smart as hell.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.121
Gavin, come in.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.011
Motherfuck.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.361
Wait, what?

23:14.680 --> 23:17.445
I am rarely wrong about these things.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.803
You have an aura about you.

23:23.120 --> 23:28.206
An aura that if carefully managed by someone
with the necessary spiritual expertise,

23:29.080 --> 23:31.481
could be harnessed to great effect.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.560
Okay.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.321
Monica.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.881
Russ, what are you doing here?

23:40.960 --> 23:44.726
Question. What's got two thumbs
and three commas?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.047
This guy.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.687
- What?
- Yeah.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.922
Like, 10 minutes after
boy genius won his lawsuit,

23:51.000 --> 23:52.240
your boss lady gave me a call.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.765
We just did a deal.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.366
She put me back over a

23:57.400 --> 23:59.528
- it means a billion.
- Yeah, I got it.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.360
I got a lot of cars, you know,

24:02.440 --> 24:04.681
if you want to go for a drive some time.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.361
Got my own.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.291
Does it go like this?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.083
Does it go like this? No?

24:12.680 --> 24:14.045
Think about it.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.571
Laurie.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.689
I just ran into Russ Hanneman leaving.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.730
He said you made him some
kind of, uh, a deal.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.926
Yes.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.482
He was substantially difficult,
truly repugnant.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.690
And when we finalized our agreement,
he described his erection to me.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.480
But in the end,

24:36.560 --> 24:39.962
I managed to buy
100% of his interest in Pied Piper.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.923
Let us never speak of him again.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.203
Well, that is fine by me,

24:45.600 --> 24:49.082
and I'm so glad that
you got him away from Pied Piper.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.329
I mean, now that their
suit has been resolved,

24:51.400 --> 24:54.768
I think that they're about to become
something really special.

24:55.120 --> 24:59.170
Their core technology, it's visionary.

24:59.240 --> 25:00.241
Absolutely.

25:00.320 --> 25:04.166
Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles

25:04.240 --> 25:06.242
with Homicide, with Intersite,

25:06.320 --> 25:12.521
with the very decision to pursue video
instead of more pioneering applications,

25:12.760 --> 25:14.410
this was all rooted in human error,

25:14.480 --> 25:18.485
which is why I found it prudent
to secure Hanneman's shares,

25:18.560 --> 25:23.043
his voting rights, and, most critically,
his board seats.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.847
Right. Russ has two board seats.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.246
He did.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.088
Now, Hendricks votes one,

25:31.360 --> 25:33.522
Bachman votes one,

25:33.600 --> 25:36.251
and we, at Raviga,

25:36.320 --> 25:37.810
we vote three.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.165
That is a majority.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.644
We can now take the necessary steps

25:42.720 --> 25:45.246
to ensure that Pied Piper
is properly managed.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.523
What are you saying?

25:51.880 --> 25:53.166
I don't understand.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.529
Monica, I believe you do.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.570
Always blue! Always blue!

26:00.640 --> 26:03.371
Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!

26:06.760 --> 26:08.125
That was a long one.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.406
It's not the first
time I've heard that.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.370
Monica, what's up?
When are you getting here?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.446
The party has already started,
and it's getting pretty crazy.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.045
I have yet to smoke weed.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.760
- What's wrong?
- This is the best day of my life.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.842
- Um, okay.
- And yet, no girls.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.251
There's nothing to it, it's just luck.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.845
Okay, well, then do it.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.081
Beat my 43.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.083
- Beat my 43.
- I'd like to smoke weed.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.640
That's the difference between you
and me, you smoke weed all day,

26:33.720 --> 26:34.926
I learn a valuable skill.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.048
Richard, are you okay?

26:37.520 --> 26:38.726
Yeah, who died?

26:40.800 --> 26:41.801
Um...

26:41.880 --> 26:43.120
What just happened?

26:43.200 --> 26:45.407
Well, apparently,

26:45.480 --> 26:51.203
Raviga held an emergency meeting
of Pied Piper's Board of Directors.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.481
Oh, no.

26:52.560 --> 26:58.488
And they voted to remove me
as CEO of my own company.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.003
I just got fired.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.169
And what about me?
