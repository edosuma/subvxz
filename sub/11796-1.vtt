The Bayside Costume Ball
is this week

01:17.177 --> 01:18.845
   and I plan
   to be chosen king.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.114
  And guess who I want
  as my queen.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.683
   Hi, Zack.

01:23.717 --> 01:26.753
That is not my queen.
That's the royal doofus.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.222
   There's my queen.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.192
   Kelly, thou art more
   hotteth today than usual.

01:32.225 --> 01:35.128
 Thank you, Zacketh.
 Why are we
 talking like thiseth?

01:35.161 --> 01:38.932
It could be an overbite.
You might need braces.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.633
  No, it's 'cause we're going
  to the costume ball

01:40.667 --> 01:43.103
  as Romeo and Juliet.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.939
   I can't wait to see you
   in those tights, Preppie.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.775
 Oh, yeah?
 What are you going as?

01:48.808 --> 01:50.710
We're going as history's
greatest lovers.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.212
   You're going
   as Sonny and Cher?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.716
  No. We're going as Cleopatra
  and Mark Antony.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.218
Those guys wore
mini-skirts, Slater.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.319
Better shave your legs.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.256
  Hey, we got to talk,
  Jessie.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.691
  Zack, I don't think
  I can go.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.092
I mean, costumes
are expensive

02:06.126 --> 02:07.660
   and money's really
   tight at home.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.095
I should look for a job.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.831
   Kelly, they're looking
   for a waitress at The Max.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.266
  Great, I'll go during lunch.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.201
   Okay. You get the job
   and I'll get the costumes.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.070
I'm going as Mel Gibson.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.607
It'll be easier
getting a date.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.375
 Why don't you go
 as <i>The Invisible Man?</i>

02:22.409 --> 02:24.310
   I would, but I don't know
   what he looks like.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.179
 ( bell rings )

02:26.212 --> 02:27.380
You guys, we better go.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.183
Don't forget our
band is practicing
after school today. Bye.

02:30.216 --> 02:33.953
Oh, no. lf I get a job,
I won't be able to
play in the band.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.121
Oh, that's okay, Kelly.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.690
Getting a job is
more important.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.091
 Okay.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.832
   You all finished?
   Yes, sir.

02:45.865 --> 02:48.635
 Please call me Jeff.
 Sir makes me feel like
 I'm losing my hair.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.341
   Okay. Little smiley faces
   in the O's.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.843
   I've never seen
   that before. Nice.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.112
  I'm a happy person.

02:59.145 --> 03:01.915
  I'm also very punctual.
  Well, I'm late sometimes...

03:01.948 --> 03:04.050
 Only if I'm not
 in the bathroom first.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.220
  Okay. I'll stay out
  of the bathroom.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.322
   I also have a very
   pleasant attitude.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.658
  Most people like me.
  I'm usually very up.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.961
Aren't you gonna
write that down?

03:15.061 --> 03:16.262
   Oh. Sorry.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.299
  Often perky.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.201
 How come I haven't
 seen you here before?

03:21.234 --> 03:22.802
I just transferred here
from Michigan.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.671
I'm a sophomore
over at UCLA.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.306
   Go Bruins!
   Did I get the job?

03:28.241 --> 03:29.809
You seem
like a nice girl

03:29.843 --> 03:31.211
 and I'm sure
 you do a great job...

03:31.244 --> 03:33.346
Then I'm hired!
All right!

03:33.380 --> 03:34.848
  Pardon my perkiness.

03:36.082 --> 03:36.983
   I would love to hire you,

03:37.083 --> 03:39.819
but the owner wants
an experienced waitress.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.689
   Oh, I have experience.
   I come from a big family.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.157
I set and clear
the dinner-table

03:44.190 --> 03:45.925
   for nine people,
   three times a week

03:45.959 --> 03:48.094
   and I don't spill a thing.
   Please.

03:49.262 --> 03:50.997
   Okay. I'll take a chance.

03:51.097 --> 03:52.732
 I'll hire you on
 a probationary basis.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.769
   Oh, thank you, thank you.
   You won't regret this.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.237
  What does that mean?

03:57.270 --> 03:58.905
  It means,
  we'll try it out
  for a couple of days

03:58.938 --> 04:00.273
   and if you
   do well, the job is yours.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.142
  Oh, it'll be great.
  I promise.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.181
  Today doesn't count,
  does it?

04:12.852 --> 04:14.320
   And don't forget,

04:14.354 --> 04:17.589
this year,
no Mr. Belding costumes.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.591
   Mrs. Belding gets
   confused easily.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.696
  Oh. Oh. Oh.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.764
   And all the boys
   who dress as girls

04:24.798 --> 04:26.199
must still use
the boys' room.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.068
  Understood?

04:28.068 --> 04:29.903
   Slater: All right,
   Mr. B. Fine.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.072
I'd like to discuss
the coronation ceremony

04:32.072 --> 04:33.106
 of the king and queen.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.307
Hey, that's a good idea.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.942
   Where should
   Kelly and I stand?

04:35.975 --> 04:38.611
   Behind Jessie and me
   with all the other losers.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.947
 Zack: Yeah,
 that's what you think.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.683
All right, now.
All right.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.686
Lisa? Ollie?
What about decorations?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.222
  Well, decorations committee
  hit a minor snag.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.658
What's the snag?

04:51.691 --> 04:53.093
   There are no decorations.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.362
   We have no money.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.897
   We were hoping to hang
   Screech from the ceiling.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.633
 Hey. I refuse
 to be a <i>pinata</i> again.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.638
 Forget it. Any extra money was
 already budgeted for a deejay.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.107
   Why don't we forget about
   the deejay

05:07.140 --> 05:09.042
  and give Lisa money
  to decorate the gym?

05:09.075 --> 05:10.944
  Our band will play for free.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.045
 Are you kids any good?

05:12.078 --> 05:13.146
Are you kidding?

05:13.179 --> 05:14.848
  We're better than MC Hammer.

05:16.349 --> 05:19.319
And I'd like to hit you
with MC's hammer.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.722
All right, all right.
You can play
but on one condition...

05:22.756 --> 05:24.657
  I get to sing one
  song with the band.

05:24.691 --> 05:25.959
   See, I'm a rocker
   from way back.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.627
   ( laughs )

05:32.766 --> 05:34.334
 This sandwich stinks.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.102
 Waitress. Yo!

05:38.104 --> 05:39.139
  Is there a problem?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.874
   Yeah. You.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.143
 Sid didn't order mayo.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.111
   Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
   you asked for mayonnaise.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.113
   I want the manager
   of this dump.

05:47.147 --> 05:50.083
 You don't have to bother him.
 I'll get you a new sandwich.

05:50.116 --> 05:54.087
  And we're not paying
  for this garbage.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.689
   Is there a problem
   here, Kelly?

05:55.722 --> 05:57.190
 No... No, there's no problem.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.826
 Sweet cheeks
 screwed up the order.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.696
   I said I'd fix it.
   I'll even pay for
   it out of my tips.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.031
 Kelly, you know the rules.
 The customer is always right.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.666
  ( laughing )

06:06.700 --> 06:10.303
  Until now.
  This order is to go.

06:10.337 --> 06:13.673
And let me give you guys
a little tip. Get lost!

06:19.045 --> 06:21.314
   I'm sorry. I should've
   handled that much better.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.782
   You're doing a fine job.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.918
Don't let a couple of
sleaze balls bother you.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.223
   Here come a couple of guys
   I know I can handle.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.861
   All right, Kelly,
   you got the job.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.629
 No, I'm on probation.
 I have to prove

06:36.663 --> 06:38.164
  to my boss that
  I'm a good waitress.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.100
You're wonderful.
He's lucky to have you.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.702
Thanks guys.
I even made $5 in tips.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.672
  Great, then you can
  pay for our lunch.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.608
   She's working, nim-wad.
   She doesn't buy our food.

06:48.641 --> 06:49.809
   We'll each have a burger.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.211
   Okay. What do you
   want to drink?

06:51.244 --> 06:54.080
  Give me a pineapple, papaya,
  cranberry sparkler.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.384
Or milk.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.754
One cow juice
coming right up.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.555
That's my boss.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.757
   Screech: Oh, yeah?

07:03.790 --> 07:05.759
Don't worry, we're cool.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.928
   Kelly, you're
   the best waitress
   we've ever had at The Max.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.232
 It a shame to waste
 such great service on
 such rotten food.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.933
Screech, please.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.602
  Hi, guys.
  Is everything okay?

07:15.635 --> 07:16.736
What a waitress.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.806
She serves French fries
just like a real
French person.

07:19.839 --> 07:20.907
   ( yelps )

07:20.940 --> 07:22.242
That's why I hired her.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.310
   I'll go put your order in.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.645
   All right.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.948
  Are those friends of yours?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.684
   Yeah, they're just trying
   to make me look good.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.719
   They don't have
   to try very hard.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.320
   You already look
   pretty good to me.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.861
  ( knocking on door )
   Come in.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.100
 Forsooth, yonder sits
 my blue jean queen.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.337
   Guess what. I got the job
   and I made $22 in tips.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.707
  Hey that's great.
  Now wait till you see this.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.843
  Kelly, willest thou
  hangeth with me
  at the costume ball

07:56.876 --> 07:59.346
  and be my... Juliet?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.548
   Oh, Zack.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.118
It's beautiful.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.753
  I don't know
  what to say.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.189
Well, start with a yes
followed by a long kiss

08:09.222 --> 08:10.724
   and I'll take over
   from there.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.029
   Zack, I really appreciate
   everything you've done,

08:16.029 --> 08:17.163
  but I have to work.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.631
 My family needs me right now.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.866
Every little bit helps.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.835
Come on, Kelly.
It's only one
Saturday night.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.670
   What if I tip you?
   I'm a big tipper.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.673
   Zack, I just got the job.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.708
I couldn't ask
for time off this soon.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.076
   I'm sorry.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.712
Me too.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.847
 ( rock music playing )

08:45.692 --> 08:48.828
  <i>* When we met I knew</i>

08:49.696 --> 08:52.198
 <i>* Right from the start</i>

08:53.433 --> 08:57.070
<i>* If you wanted to *</i>

08:57.070 --> 08:58.938
( off-key chord plays )

09:01.041 --> 09:03.009
   Sorry. Was it me?

09:03.009 --> 09:05.311
   It's been you all morning.
   What's the problem?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.347
 I just can't stop
 thinking about Kelly.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.816
I can't stop thinking
about Denzel Washington,

09:09.849 --> 09:11.685
   but I'm still able
   to live my life.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.888
  Aw, I'm just bummed.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.023
   Kelly won't ask
   for the night off.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.125
Well, then why don't you
ask her boss for her?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.628
  Hey, that's not a bad idea.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.863
Excuse me. Jeff?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.032
  Hi, I'm Zack Morris.
  Remember me?

09:26.032 --> 09:27.100
  Yeah...yeah. Don't tell me.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.636
 You're
 the pineapple-prune juice guy.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.238
 No, no, no.
 I'm the medium burger
 hold-the-onions guy.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.374
Also known as
Kelly's boyfriend Zack.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.410
 Boyfriend? Kelly never
 mentioned a boyfriend.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.714
   If she didn't mention me,
   you must be working her
   too hard.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.282
   It's a good thing
   I came when I did.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.650
   Why? What's wrong?

09:43.683 --> 09:44.818
   Well, we better sit down.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.655
 Gosh.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.059
You see, Jeff, Kelly is
an only child

09:53.093 --> 09:54.728
   and this Saturday
   is her father's birthday.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.263
 Now, it would break
 his already weak heart

09:57.297 --> 09:58.865
 if his only
 daughter wasn't there

09:58.898 --> 10:00.867
 to help him
 blow out the candles.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.903
   Having a sick parent must
   be really rough
   on an only child.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.272
Oh, man, it's the worst.
You can't imagine.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.308
   Oh, I can.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.978
   Especially, when
   that only child has
   six brothers and sisters.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.316
   Oh, so that's who
   those people were.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.952
  I thought they were
  very short aunts and uncles.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.453
 Come on, Zack.
 What gives?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.156
All right, look.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.791
 Saturday is a big
 costume ball at school

10:24.824 --> 10:25.725
   and I want Kelly to come,

10:25.759 --> 10:27.894
 but she's afraid to
 ask for the night off.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.896
 Why didn't you
 just say so?

10:29.929 --> 10:31.031
  What, you mean you'll do it?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.432
  Yeah, sure. Why not?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.768
Hey. You're a great guy
just like Kelly said.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.936
  She did?
  That's nice.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.940
 And Jeff's majoring in pre-law

10:40.974 --> 10:43.243
   with a minor in
   romance languages.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.412
  I've heard that line before.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.946
 It's not a line, Lisa.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.948
  He's so nice once
  you get to know him.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.051
   I feel like I've known him
   my whole life.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.019
  You've been blabbing
  about him all night.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.821
Have not.
  Yes, you have.

10:54.854 --> 10:57.123
  I know everything about him
  but his shoe size.

10:57.157 --> 11:02.162
   Ten and a half.
   You were in the bathroom.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.298
   Call me crazy,
   but I think you've
   got a thing for this guy.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.167
Get out!
Just because he's hot...

11:10.437 --> 11:14.107
 I mean, kind of good looking,
 doesn't mean I like him.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.343
 I don't know, Kelly,
 you seem hung up on this guy.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.745
 I am not.
 Come on, he's my boss.

11:18.778 --> 11:22.115
Yeah, and I bet you guys
have a very professional
relationship.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.284
   Yes, and speaking
   of relationships,

11:24.317 --> 11:26.886
   whatever happened
   to that cute guy
   you used to date?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.421
   I think his name was Zack.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.957
Guys, I still love Zack.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.760
   Jeff's just a new friend.
   That's all.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.395
 Yeah right,
 and acne's a turn on.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.972
  You know, I am beat.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.175
 I must have served
 a zillion hamburgers tonight.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.178
   Then I guess it's time
   for you to rest your buns.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.349
  Hey, I'm not complaining.
  I made $30 in tips tonight.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.853
Not bad. Sounds like you
can afford to
take a night off.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.322
   What do you mean?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.791
   Kelly, everybody
   is talking about
   this costume ball.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.393
Now, why aren't
you going?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.661
   Jeff, I just got this job.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.263
 I couldn't ask
 for time off already.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.065
  If you'd like to go,
  take the night off.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.433
   It's okay with me.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.335
Are you sure you're
not gonna miss me, here?

12:15.368 --> 12:16.803
  Of course,
  I'm gonna miss you.

12:16.836 --> 12:17.971
   I always miss you
   when you're gone.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.710
You do?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.078
You're terrific, Kelly.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.414
 You too, Jeff.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.683
You know,
you're the nicest guy
I've met in a long time.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.368
 I better get going.
 I'll see you tomorrow.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.952
  I hope it didn't
  cause you a problem.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.755
Jeff, the problem is...
I liked it.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.260
   Hey, guys,

13:14.294 --> 13:16.663
 I've just got one thing to say
 about Kelly's new career.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.965
   She is a knockout
   in that waitress uniform.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.901
Whoa. You can
say that again.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.071
No, you won't
say that again.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.973
  What a stupid idea.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.975
   Hey, Kelly. Why don't you
   come over and sit down?

13:29.075 --> 13:29.909
  I don't think I can.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.112
Of course, you can.
Can't you take a break?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.247
  Yeah, in fact, Kelly,
  why don't you sit right here

13:34.280 --> 13:35.382
so Screech has to move?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.184
 You just want to stare
 across the table into my eyes.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.321
Hey guys. Kelly's boss
gave her the night off.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.423
  Now she can go to the dance
  with me. Isn't that great?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.725
Yeah.
   That's wonderful.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.761
Sounds like fun.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.130
   Now, should I go
   as Bart Simpson
   and shave my head

13:50.163 --> 13:52.198
   or as Al Bundy
   and shave my back?

13:53.767 --> 13:56.202
 Why don't you go as Barf Bundy
 and put your head in a bag?

13:57.470 --> 14:00.273
  Wait a second.
  What do we do about Belding?

14:00.306 --> 14:03.309
   Major earplug alert.
   He still plans on singing.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.178
   That's no problem.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.946
   We'll just crank
   up the feedback
   and drown him out.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.050
Oh, hi, guys.
Can I get you something?

14:10.050 --> 14:13.853
 Yeah. One celery,
 rhubarb, turnip tonic.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.221
   Sorry,
   we just sold the last one.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.391
  Then give me a milk
  with an olive in it.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.660
   I better get back to work,
   my break's almost over.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.796
 There's no rush, Kelly.
 Take as much time as you want.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.264
Zack: All right.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.932
Hey, nice boss.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.701
You know,
if I ever have to work,

14:27.734 --> 14:29.703
  which I never plan on doing,

14:29.736 --> 14:31.137
  I hope it's for you.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.645
   Jeff, thanks again
   for giving my girl
   the night off on Saturday.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.080
  Yeah, sure.
  No problem.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.083
 Have fun at the dance.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.087
 What's wrong?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.288
   I'm at work, Zack.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.123
   You're on a break.
   Just don't, okay?

14:50.156 --> 14:51.925
  I have to go.
  See you guys later.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.905
  Hey, did either of you guys
  notice anything different

15:05.939 --> 15:07.073
about Kelly at The Max?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.042
  Yeah. She's a waitress now.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.113
   I know that, noodle head.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.347
 It's kind of weird.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.782
I feel like I'm getting
the cold shoulder.

15:15.815 --> 15:16.950
 Sounds like
 the flu to me.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.918
 I'd wear
 a turtleneck tomorrow.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.756
   You are a strange
   and weird person.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.058
  Thanks for noticing.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.397
   Hey, Slater. Do you think
   Kelly likes somebody else?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.933
 Uh-uh. No way.
 She passed me
 over for you.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.635
Who's left
for her to like?

15:35.669 --> 15:37.904
 She did bring me
 an extra pickle today.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.205
I wonder
what that meant.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.410
  Naw. It's probably
  just my imagination.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.146
 Yeah. Besides, where
 would she meet anyone?

15:46.179 --> 15:48.748
She's at school all day.
Don't worry about it.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.084
   You're right.
   I'm worrying over nothing.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.086
And the rest of the time
she's working at The Max

15:53.119 --> 15:55.088
 with that good-looking
 college guy Jeff.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.068
  <i>* When we met I knew</i>

16:09.035 --> 16:11.604
 <i>* Right from the start</i>

16:13.039 --> 16:15.775
   <i>* If you wanted to</i>

16:17.043 --> 16:19.646
   <i>* You could take my heart</i>

16:21.047 --> 16:24.784
<i>* How can I say</i>

16:24.818 --> 16:27.887
  <i>* I want to be</i>
  <i>with you every day?</i>

16:29.356 --> 16:32.692
 <i>* Make my day</i>

16:32.726 --> 16:35.895
  <i>* You drive me crazy</i>
  <i>in a good way</i>

16:37.263 --> 16:39.299
<i>* Hey, hey, hey</i>

16:40.700 --> 16:42.135
<i>* I hope you're</i>
<i>here to stay</i>

16:45.205 --> 16:47.107
 <i>* Make my day</i>

16:47.140 --> 16:48.708
 <i>* Hey</i>

16:48.742 --> 16:50.643
  <i>* You drive me crazy</i>
  <i>in a good way</i>

16:53.146 --> 16:54.914
<i>* Hey, hey, hey</i>

16:56.316 --> 16:58.818
<i>* I hope you're</i>
<i>here to stay *</i>

17:01.287 --> 17:02.889
( all cheering )

17:05.692 --> 17:07.027
 Thank you. Thank you.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.060
  Now, before we take a break

17:08.094 --> 17:09.762
  I'd like to
  introduce the band.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.631
The tonsils you've been
looking at all night

17:11.664 --> 17:13.867
 belong to
 our lead singer Jessie Spano.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.772
Y'all beautiful.
Peace. Equality.

17:19.806 --> 17:23.108
And the boss of the bass
and backup vocals,
Lisa Turtle.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.611
( all cheering )

17:24.644 --> 17:26.212
   Guy: Yeah!
   Keep on rockin'.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.249
All right.
And none other than
AC Slater on the sticks.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.220
  Smooth, AC,
  real smooth.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.822
And last,
but certainly not least,

17:35.855 --> 17:37.757
 Screech Powers
 tickling the ivories.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.227
 Cock-a-doodle, dudes!

17:42.395 --> 17:44.698
 And I'm Zack Morris.
 Everyone have a ball.

17:49.703 --> 17:51.971
Hey, Kelly, what did you
think of the last song?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.174
   Oh, I'm fine.
   Not hungry at all.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.109
  No, the song, Kelly.
  Did you like it?

17:56.142 --> 17:57.377
 Oh, it was great. I liked it.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.878
  I wrote it for you.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.248
 What? I mean, thanks.
 I mean, I'm thirsty.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.017
I'll get you some punch.
   No. I'll go get it.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.256
  Kelly, are you okay?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.926
No, I'm not.
It is so weird.

18:13.026 --> 18:16.029
   I mean, I'm here with Zack
   and he's the greatest guy,

18:16.029 --> 18:17.931
  but all I can
  think about is Jeff.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.666
 Now, it's my pleasure
 to announce

18:19.699 --> 18:21.901
  the king and queen
  of the costume ball.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.204
 The envelope, please.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.606
 Thanks, mummy.
 ( cackles )

18:28.108 --> 18:30.076
   Drum roll!

18:30.110 --> 18:32.112
   The king and queen
   of the costume ball are...

18:34.047 --> 18:36.716
   Romeo and Juliet.
   Zack and Kelly.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.084
  Wherefore art they?

18:44.858 --> 18:47.327
 Kelly, you're the most
 beautiful queen
 I've ever seen.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.495
 Thanks, Jeff.

18:50.864 --> 18:53.233
  Well, Zack, looks
  like I finally
  get to crown you.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.268
 Get it? Ha-ha, ha-ha.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.070
Congratulations.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.246
   May your reign
   be long and detentionless.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.017
   Hey, Kelly,
   let's go outside.
   We need to talk.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.688
Should we wait for Zack?

19:14.721 --> 19:17.023
  I don't know where he went.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.591
   Forget it.
   Let's just do it.

19:20.694 --> 19:23.797
Okay, everyone.
This is the last dance.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.299
  So find that special person
  and make it good.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.270
   One...two...three.

19:44.718 --> 19:47.187
  <i>* I could hardly believe it</i>

19:47.220 --> 19:48.788
 <i>* When I heard</i>
 <i>the news today</i>

19:50.790 --> 19:54.961
   <i>* I had to come and get it</i>
   <i>straight from you</i>

19:58.198 --> 20:00.367
 <i>* They said you were leaving,</i>

20:00.400 --> 20:03.803
<i>* Someone swept</i>
<i>your heart away</i>

20:03.837 --> 20:06.373
  <i>* From the look upon</i>
  <i>your face</i>

20:06.406 --> 20:08.208
   <i>* I see it's true</i>

20:10.443 --> 20:12.312
   <i>* So tell me all about it</i>

20:12.345 --> 20:15.181
<i>* Tell me about</i>
<i>the plans you're making</i>

20:17.317 --> 20:21.321
  <i>* Tell me one thing</i>
  <i>more before I go</i>

20:24.024 --> 20:29.329
 <i>* How am I supposed to</i>
 <i>live without you? *</i>

20:29.362 --> 20:32.198
 I know there's something
 going on between you and Jeff.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.933
Please, just talk to me.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.736
I don't know
how to say this.

20:36.770 --> 20:40.273
It's just that Jeff
and I have been
working together and...

20:40.306 --> 20:42.275
Do you really like him?

20:42.308 --> 20:44.944
   No... Yes.

20:44.978 --> 20:48.214
   I don't know.
   It's just all
   happening so fast.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.718
Kelly, what happened?
I thought you loved me.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.021
  I do love you, Zack.

20:55.055 --> 20:56.823
   It wasn't supposed
   to be this way.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.192
  Not for us.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.293
   I didn't want to hurt you

21:00.326 --> 21:01.928
  for anything
  in the whole world.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.331
  I thought we'd
  always be together.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.901
  Zack, I'm so sorry.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.972
 I'll miss you, Kelly.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.974
  Well, hey, how about
  one last dance?

21:15.075 --> 21:16.242
 I'd like that.

21:19.813 --> 21:23.683
   <i>* When all that I've been</i>
   <i>living for is gone *</i>

21:31.391 --> 21:33.660
Can we still be friends?

21:34.127 --> 21:35.729
Forever.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.206
