01:50.040 --> 01:51.929
<i>Is heaven a hope?</i>

01:53.040 --> 01:55.281
<i>Or as real as the earth and sky?</i>

01:57.040 --> 02:00.123
<i>I once asked my grandfather that question.</i>

02:00.800 --> 02:05.647
<i>And he said by the time he knew the answer
it would be too late for him to tell me.</i>

02:07.160 --> 02:10.163
<i>The day would come when
I asked that question again,</i>

02:11.080 --> 02:13.447
<i>staring into the eyes of my son.</i>

02:44.480 --> 02:47.643
- Mighty quick.
- I don't get paid by the hour.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.087
I'm afraid you don't get
paid by cash, either.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.640
- Are you sure you're okay with the carpet?
- Times are tough.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.530
Your business improves, mine will, too.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.962
- Why don't you grab a hose?
- Did you rob a carpet store, Todd?

03:46.040 --> 03:49.044
Unlike you guys, I actually have a job.
Look at these bums.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.885
And he's got five of them.
Do you want some help?

03:53.240 --> 03:56.642
You know, if you keep accepting
things instead of money,

03:56.720 --> 03:59.246
eventually, you're going to run out
of things and money.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.926
Yeah, I have to downsize, man. Downsize.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.487
You ladies just keep your seats.
Todd and I got this.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.211
- Yeah, don't help. Not necessary.
- No problem.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.006
Longhorns, let's go! Line it up!
Show me what you got!

04:12.320 --> 04:13.765
Coach is late!

04:14.120 --> 04:16.521
Go, go, Burpos, Burpos!

04:17.079 --> 04:21.165
Let's go, Davidson! You were slacking
last week. These ladies are watching.

04:22.079 --> 04:24.208
That's it, that's it.
That's what I'm talking about right there.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.850
I want you and you up.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.328
<i>Every blessing</i>

05:01.400 --> 05:04.722
<i>Tune my heart to sing Thy grace</i>

05:04.840 --> 05:07.047
Every Monday.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.888
<i>Never ceasing</i>

05:10.080 --> 05:14.324
<i>Call for songs of loudest praise</i>

05:14.400 --> 05:18.724
<i>Teach me some melodious sonnet</i>

05:18.800 --> 05:23.249
<i>Sung by flaming tongues above</i>

05:23.360 --> 05:27.570
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
We gotta work on that pitch, ladies.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.482
- Well, it's a little bit pious.
- Shall we try it one more time?

05:32.600 --> 05:37.162
<i>Come, Thou Fount of every blessing</i>

05:37.240 --> 05:41.609
<i>Tune my heart to sing Thy grace</i>

05:41.680 --> 05:45.924
<i>Streams of mercy, never ceasing</i>

05:46.040 --> 05:48.520
<i>Call for songs of loudest praise</i>

05:48.600 --> 05:50.284
Okay, once more.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.603
<i>Come, Thou Fount of every blessing</i>

05:55.120 --> 05:57.600
- There's my guy
- Daddy!

05:57.680 --> 05:59.967
How are you? What's happening?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.451
How are you doing?

06:04.920 --> 06:08.083
How was your day?
What's going on in there?

06:08.400 --> 06:12.644
Mom has a house full of women
and Cassie thinks she's one, too.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.923
Oh, no. They're singing.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.440
<i>Tongues above</i>

06:32.920 --> 06:34.445
Todd's home.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.644
All right, how about boy's night out,
we go get some pizza? Pizza Palace?

06:38.720 --> 06:40.563
- Really?
- What do you think?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.165
What do you think?

06:42.280 --> 06:44.647
Does that sound good?
What kind are you going to get?

06:44.720 --> 06:46.165
- Cheese.
- No, you're not.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.163
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.330
What's wrong, Dad?

06:51.440 --> 06:55.923
There are some people over at the hospital
and they want me to come by.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.640
<i>To sing Thy grace</i>

06:58.920 --> 07:01.241
<i>- I'll</i> go with you.
- You're going to go with me?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.209
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.001
It might be a little sad or a little scary.

07:07.080 --> 07:11.642
That's all right.
If I'm with you, I won't be afraid.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.530
You're coming with me, then.
Hospital and pizza. Hospital and pizza.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.764
Let's go.
You know what we say when we're hungry?

07:30.720 --> 07:32.529
There's the doctor.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.770
- Reverend Burpo.
- Todd.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.001
- Todd.
- Yeah.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.046
My name is Lee. My father
asked for a pastor.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.207
- Would you mind talking to him?
- Sure.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.401
- Great.
- Sure. Are you okay, pal?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.210
He's in here.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.565
My name's Todd.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.003
I'm here to pray for you.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.882
Is there anything you're sorry for?

08:24.560 --> 08:25.925
Everything.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.847
I believe God forgives.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.126
And if he forgives anything,
he forgives everything.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.885
Our Father who art in heaven,

08:44.520 --> 08:45.851
hallowed be Thy name.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.691
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

08:48.760 --> 08:51.127
on earth as it is in heaven.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.124
<i>"And then said to the
lion, 'Of all the deaths</i>

08:57.200 --> 09:01.728
"'we could have died,
this is the one we would have chosen."'

09:03.120 --> 09:04.645
Take your blanket.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.801
- Night-night.
- Dad.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.331
- Yeah?
- I prayed for the sick man.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.764
<i>We're currently looking at 62 degrees</i>

09:47.840 --> 09:50.366
<i>with winds out of the south-southwest
at 13 miles an hour.</i>

09:50.440 --> 09:52.920
<i>Lows expected to be in the mid-to upper...</i>

10:00.120 --> 10:02.851
When Jay offered us a house
as a part of my salary,

10:02.920 --> 10:04.922
he never mentioned the rail road.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.691
I like the rumble. It's romantic.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.089
- How tight are we this month?
- No, don't talk about money.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.202
Slim Forrest couldn't pay for
those garage doors.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.961
He donated some carpet
for the church instead.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.689
But he said he had the cash
when he placed the order.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.571
Things changed.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.208
You had a rough day, didn't you?

10:34.120 --> 10:38.728
As long as I'm with you, I'm not afraid.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.325
You're good.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.083
But let me tell you something.

10:50.240 --> 10:54.848
The next time I'm practicing your
favorite hymn and you howl like a dog,

10:54.920 --> 10:57.241
I'm going to whip you like a dog.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.765
Do you hear me?

10:59.360 --> 11:01.362
Doesn't sound so bad.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.607
Stop.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.850
<i>For I love the little children of the world</i>

11:14.200 --> 11:18.842
<i>I will take you by the hand
Lead you to a better land</i>

11:18.920 --> 11:20.524
<i>For I love.</i>

11:20.600 --> 11:24.446
Do you think Mom realizes
how funny she looks when she does that?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.920
No. And we're not going
to tell her, are we?

11:29.040 --> 11:32.249
<i>All the children of the world</i>

11:32.760 --> 11:37.448
<i>Red and yellow, black and white
All are precious in his sight</i>

11:37.560 --> 11:41.531
<i>Jesus loves the little
children of the world</i>

11:47.280 --> 11:51.490
High five. Really good.
Really good, Douglas.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.088
Voices of angels, right?

11:55.480 --> 12:00.611
Well, this morning I want to talk to you about
what sort of commitment makes a marriage,

12:01.120 --> 12:04.806
makes a relationship, makes up a life.

12:07.920 --> 12:12.084
Last night, I stood in the bedroom where
our children sleep

12:12.160 --> 12:15.642
and I listened to their mother read them
a bedtime story.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.088
And in the final saga
of this wonderful land

12:19.160 --> 12:24.405
where animals talk with humans
and a great lion leads them all to love

12:24.480 --> 12:27.689
and faith and courage.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.243
In the last chapter of this great story,

12:31.320 --> 12:34.608
written for children just like me
and Mrs. Davis over here,

12:35.320 --> 12:40.531
all of the lion's enemies have swept away
his followers except for two,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.080
a bear and a unicorn,

12:43.360 --> 12:45.931
who are trapped in a cave with the lion.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.846
And because
the entrance to this cave is narrow,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.846
the wave after wave of soldiers that
the evil king sends in

12:53.960 --> 12:55.769
to try and kill them can't do it.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.526
The lion, the bear, the unicorn,
they fight them off.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.125
So finally, the king sends in a messenger.

13:01.200 --> 13:06.730
He says, "Look, the one that we really want,
the one we're interested in, is that lion.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.168
"Give him up and the rest of you will live.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.891
"The unicorn, we're going
to cut his horn off.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.282
"We'll make him pull a cart
for the rest of his life.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.610
"The bear, we're going to put in chains
and shackles, make him dance in the circus.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.809
"But both Of you Will live.

13:25.240 --> 13:29.723
"All you have to do is give up that lion."

13:32.240 --> 13:35.084
Finally, the lion looks at his friends with
that look in his eyes,

13:35.160 --> 13:36.924
"What are you going to do?"

13:37.080 --> 13:40.562
And the bear and the
unicorn, they just smile

13:40.640 --> 13:44.247
and they say,
"Of all the deaths that we could have died,

13:44.840 --> 13:49.402
"this right here is the one
we would have chosen."

13:53.920 --> 13:58.164
But the bear and the lion and the unicorn,
they weren't looking for an easy road.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.847
I don't think Jesus was either
when he accepted the cross.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.528
There's a lot of people,
they don't believe that story anymore than

14:05.600 --> 14:08.444
the one about the lion, the bear,
and the unicorn.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.207
I'm here with you all this morning
because I believe in them both.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.281
And I'll never give up that lion.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.202
- Rosa.
- Sonja.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.930
- How are you?
- I'm good.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.682
I have something I wanted to give you.
It's just something small.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.125
Thank you.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.043
Oh, Sonja, this is too beautiful.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.441
No. Not for her.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.410
- I'll see you guys next Sunday.
- Yeah. Take care.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.326
Look, baby. Sonja gave it to us for Lucia.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.640
It's gorgeous.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.888
You're great when I'm there to inspire you.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.850
If you want to inspire me, you get a hit at
that softball game this afternoon.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.490
Outstanding. I will.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.242
- Watch that ball like that.
- Embarrassing.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.522
- He's a good batter.
- Embarrassing.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.491
All right, Jay!

15:35.120 --> 15:36.167
Hold up.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.441
- Let's go, baby.
- Come on, Sonja!

15:41.440 --> 15:45.206
- Come on, Mama!
- All right! Let's go, Sonja!

15:46.120 --> 15:47.645
Two more!

15:48.120 --> 15:50.168
- Come on, Mama.
- Go!

15:56.120 --> 15:58.726
Go! Go, go, go!

15:59.720 --> 16:01.484
- No!
"Out!

16:01.880 --> 16:05.202
- No, he knocked it loose. He's safe! Safe.
- There you go.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.322
- You can't do that, man. That's dirty.
- Or what? ls there a problem?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.050
Is there a problem?

16:15.880 --> 16:17.325
I'm all right.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.483
You just got me warmed up, baby.
You got me warmed up now.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.846
Come on, baby.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.844
Yeah, let's go. Easy out.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.208
Yeah, Todd!

16:30.520 --> 16:32.329
- Go, Sonja!
- Yes!

16:34.480 --> 16:37.404
- Come on, Todd!
- Safe. Safe.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.921
Michael, Michael! It's bad, it's bad!

16:51.520 --> 16:54.524
Hold on, let me look. Don't move.
Get my bag.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.443
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you okay?

16:56.560 --> 16:58.289
Todd, just stay still, buddy.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.204
- We have to cut your pants, Todd.
- Don't touch it!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.122
- It's a spiral fracture.
- Is it going to heal?

17:06.200 --> 17:09.170
It'll heal, but he won't be climbing
any ladders soon.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.890
Todd, just stay still, buddy.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.884
I'm going to put some pressure on it,
Todd, okay?

17:16.440 --> 17:18.521
Todd, we gotta lift it up, buddy.

17:18.640 --> 17:19.971
We gotta lift it up.

17:20.119 --> 17:24.647
As many of you already know,
I was hurt sliding into third.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.406
- I was safe.
- No, he was out.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.930
Okay, I was out.

17:33.960 --> 17:38.170
I had a great teacher early in the ministry

17:38.240 --> 17:42.484
who told me that
we'd have good days and bad days

17:42.600 --> 17:45.570
and we'd seldom know at the time
which is which.

17:46.480 --> 17:51.486
But a few Sundays ago, as I was sliding
into third and I heard the crack of my leg,

17:52.560 --> 17:55.166
I had a pretty good idea which was which.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.927
So, the Bible talks about adversity.
The Bible talks about

18:03.840 --> 18:07.526
all things working together for the good.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.840
Todd! What...

18:19.680 --> 18:21.284
Okay, I'm all right.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.162
- It's my back.
- Are you all right?

18:26.680 --> 18:27.841
Don't move.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.444
- Lie down.
- I'm on it.

18:31.520 --> 18:35.127
- It's Pastor Todd. He's fallen.
- Nancy, sing Amazing Grace.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.731
- Don't move, don't move.
- It's just a spasm.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.802
It's my back. It's my back.

18:45.720 --> 18:49.042
<i>Amazing Grace</i>

18:49.160 --> 18:53.643
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

18:53.720 --> 18:58.248
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

18:58.360 --> 19:00.522
<i>Like me</i>

19:03.240 --> 19:06.084
- it's kidney stones again.
- Yeah.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.323
All we can do is give you painkillers
and lots of water and let you pass them.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.562
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.924
You're going to be all right.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.925
- Jay!
- Hey.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.931
Todd's passing another stone,
so Colton and I, we're going to the park.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.161
All right.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.130
- Giddyup, horsey!
- Horseys bite. Did I tell you that?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.929
How's he doing?

19:36.840 --> 19:37.921
Todd?

19:48.280 --> 19:49.281
Todd?

19:50.280 --> 19:54.205
I'm passing another one!

19:58.440 --> 20:00.363
Todd, it's Jay!

20:01.760 --> 20:03.444
How are you doing, buddy?

20:03.960 --> 20:06.930
Can I do anything for you?

20:07.440 --> 20:11.490
- What, do you want to try and catch it?
- No. That's not what I had in mind.

20:11.760 --> 20:16.641
- How many have you passed?
- I've passed seven, Jay! Seven!

20:16.720 --> 20:18.563
That's a bunch.

20:18.640 --> 20:22.725
I think they usually say you gotta pass
about 14, 15 to make sure they're gone.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.810
What do you want?

20:25.920 --> 20:29.163
Well, you know, we're sort of wondering

20:29.280 --> 20:32.090
when you think
you might be able to preach again.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.323
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

20:38.120 --> 20:41.567
- From the prison ministry.
- Giving is a good...

20:41.640 --> 20:43.608
He's used to captive audiences.

20:43.960 --> 20:48.761
- Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit.
- She's from the seminary.

20:48.840 --> 20:52.686
If Todd isn't back soon,
I'm going to kill somebody.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.448
And I'm going to start with you.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.921
- Holy Spirit.
- Use an anvil.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.329
We need to get out of town.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.685
A family getaway.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.691
I know a great place. Denver.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.041
Denver?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.601
We can bring the kids, go for a weekend.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.804
- When?
- I don't know. Soon.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.886
No, honey. I have to focus on work.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.480
- We need it.
- We've got to get some bills paid.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.971
You need it.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.042
- All right, well...
- There's no way, I'm telling you.

21:45.120 --> 21:49.045
Okay. I'm just saying, if you did,

21:49.840 --> 21:51.490
I would...

21:57.320 --> 21:58.560
Now?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.160
Okay.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.849
Not now. If you say we can go.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.763
Kids, we're going to Denver!

22:07.760 --> 22:12.163
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

22:12.600 --> 22:16.764
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

22:16.840 --> 22:21.209
<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

22:21.360 --> 22:24.045
<i>Could we sing We Will Rock You?</i>

22:28.920 --> 22:31.366
<i>Buddy you're a boy
Make a big noise</i>

22:31.440 --> 22:34.603
<i>Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man some day</i>

22:34.720 --> 22:38.042
<i>You got mud on your face
You big disgrace</i>

22:38.120 --> 22:40.964
<i>Kicking your can all over the place</i>

22:41.040 --> 22:45.250
<i>Singing "We will, we will rock you"</i>

22:51.720 --> 22:54.963
I wouldn't want to eat a monarch.
They taste so bad.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.771
- You wouldn't want to eat it?
- Yeah, for sure.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.727
- He's coming home with us.
- Do you see his eyes?

23:04.440 --> 23:07.125
- He wants to...
- No, he wants...

23:07.720 --> 23:09.085
There he goes.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.164
Dad, speed up.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.000
Look!

23:23.720 --> 23:26.087
- Here's a butterfly.
- Yeah, look at that one.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.491
Oh, my gosh.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.323
Look! They've got a place where
you can hold a tarantula.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.640
There's one.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.241
- A butterfly.
- Pretty good, right?

23:38.520 --> 23:40.807
Let's follow that guy.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.209
- What do you think? Is she soft?
- Yeah.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.208
- I did it, I did it!
- You sure did.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.123
I want a sticker.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.965
If you want a sticker,
you have to get in there and hold Rosie.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.567
- Colton, why don't you try?
- No.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.968
<i>Hello, Doctor, it's Sonja Burpo.</i>

24:23.040 --> 24:25.407
<i>Colton started throwing up
on the way home in the car.</i>

24:25.480 --> 24:26.641
<i>Cassie!</i>

24:27.000 --> 24:30.561
No, I don't. Cassie. Cassie. Honey.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.526
Yeah.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.040
- Todd!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.164
- His temperature is 103.
- Keep it in there.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.402
- And Cassie is throwing up now also.
- Don't get any in your hair.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.811
Don't get any in your hair.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.769
- Honey. Thank you. Thank you.
- Those are chunks.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.444
You've got to chew your food.

24:46.520 --> 24:50.525
The doctor says that
the flu's been going around and... Todd!

24:50.840 --> 24:54.765
Hey, this is Todd Burpo,
Overhead Garage Door, Imperial, Nebraska.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.689
That's right. Right.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.684
I got that big order for
the 591 series doors.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.402
B-U-R-P-O. Okay, I'm
sending in that deposit.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.683
I'm going to pay that in full
with the job completion, all right?

25:06.760 --> 25:09.525
Okay, thank you very much.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.605
His fever's up.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.167
- I thought it was holding steady.
- It was.

25:18.240 --> 25:22.040
It's now 104. It's been four days.
Cassie is fine.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.602
I mean, could it be appendicitis?
You had it in college. I've had it.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.125
Maybe this is the beginning of it.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.009
- I'm going to try to call...
- No, I already tried.

25:29.080 --> 25:32.368
We've got to take him
to the medical center. Now.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.521
All right.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.770
Cassie!

25:43.120 --> 25:45.122
Todd, we need to hurry.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.880
Faster, Todd.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.007
He has a ruptured appendix.
We need to get him to surgery right away.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.286
Call the OR.

26:17.480 --> 26:20.245
- Daddy, don't let them take me.
- I'm right here, buddy.

26:20.320 --> 26:23.403
- Ruptured when?
- It looks like days ago. He's very sick.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.562
Dawn, run ahead, get everybody ready.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.450
- But how can that happen?
- The blotches on the X-ray are infected.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.602
It exploded all through
his abdominal cavity.

26:30.680 --> 26:31.841
But he's going to be okay, right?

26:31.920 --> 26:35.845
We're going to get in there and clean him out.
You'll have to wait here.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.601
Stay right there, please.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.210
Are they ready for us in OR?
I need his status ASAP.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.884
<i>- I'll</i> come with you.
- No, no, I just need a minute.

27:45.200 --> 27:49.091
You've made me suffer. And I took that.

27:51.440 --> 27:54.091
You made my family suffer and I took that.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.089
You're going to take my boy?

28:03.080 --> 28:07.290
Don't you take my son.
Don't you take my son!

28:08.120 --> 28:11.522
His blood pressure is falling.
We're losing him.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.961
Sonja.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.770
How's Colton?

28:23.120 --> 28:25.122
We're in trouble here.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.930
He's...

28:31.200 --> 28:33.806
He's not... He's not doing well.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.282
He's worse. He's <i>much</i> worse. And I...

28:37.400 --> 28:39.641
No. No.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.411
Will you call some friends

28:45.240 --> 28:47.607
and ask them to pray for him?

28:48.720 --> 28:52.406
Of course, I will, honey. Right now.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.808
I'll pray for you, too.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.571
Thank you.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.364
Jay, we've got a problem.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.920
Please help us watch over this little boy.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.845
He's very precious.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.367
I've heard him say so many times
what a fine young man you are.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.086
I have a favor I'd like to ask.

29:26.160 --> 29:32.042
For our brother, for his
family, for his boy.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.488
<i>Rosa, it's Nancy from the church.</i>

29:35.560 --> 29:38.723
<i>Colton Burpo is in the hospital
and he may not live.</i>

29:55.480 --> 29:57.369
Our Father who art in heaven...

30:02.960 --> 30:04.962
Mr. and Mrs. Burpo.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.366
Colton.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.167
Hi.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.930
Hi, buddy.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.526
Hi.

30:27.400 --> 30:32.201
Dad, I want to hold

30:33.800 --> 30:35.848
that spider.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.081
Wow.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.562
I think it's amazing.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.131
- How is it?
- Fun.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.241
- Now you have to do it.
- I'm not going to do it.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.560
- Do it, do it!
- I'm not doing it.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.880
- Do you want a sticker?
- Get the kid a sticker.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.007
Okay.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.809
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.970
That's fun.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.530
I've been here.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.409
Here? I don't think
we've been here before, pal.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.769
- Guess what.
- What?

31:45.720 --> 31:48.644
- I like spiders.
- I saw that!

31:49.120 --> 31:52.044
You got a sticker. You're
not afraid anymore.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.042
We don't ever have to be scared.

31:56.160 --> 31:59.209
Is that why you wanted to come back,
to show me you weren't afraid?

31:59.280 --> 32:00.725
It's important.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.324
What about the hospital?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.927
How do you feel about that?
Does that scare you?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.890
No, that's where the angels sang to me.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.368
The angels sang to you?

32:13.840 --> 32:14.887
Yes.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.566
When?

32:17.640 --> 32:22.771
During the operation, when Mom
was in one room talking on the phone,

32:22.840 --> 32:27.402
and you were in another
room yelling at God.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.604
How did you know that?

32:41.840 --> 32:43.683
Because I saw you.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.965
When did you see me?

32:46.680 --> 32:50.890
I lifted up and I looked down
and saw the doctor working on me.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.206
<i>And I saw you and Mommy.</i>

33:00.320 --> 33:01.810
You saw...

33:12.320 --> 33:14.402
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

33:14.480 --> 33:16.084
<i>A storm's coming.</i>

33:16.360 --> 33:17.566
<i>Are you setting records?</i>

33:17.680 --> 33:20.047
- You got a sticker, huh?
- It's a record.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.802
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.931
How was the trip?

33:28.720 --> 33:32.566
- It was good. Fine.
- Just fine?

33:32.640 --> 33:33.687
It was amazing, actually.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.286
Colton held that spider like
he was holding his Spider-Man.

33:36.360 --> 33:37.486
Come on.

33:40.080 --> 33:45.371
Did he ever mention this idea to you
of hearing angels singing?

33:46.800 --> 33:49.041
Not unless you're talking about
you and me in the shower.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.481
Todd, these bills, they are coming through.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.404
- How bad?
- $23,000.

33:54.920 --> 33:58.970
I mean, do we have any receivables,
anything we can collect at all?

33:59.040 --> 34:01.930
These utilities, we can put those off.

34:02.720 --> 34:06.805
Now this one, I have to pay Jack Martin
for those truck tires. His wife is sick.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.963
We've got a medical bill
coming in as well. $34,000.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.724
- I thought this was part of the $23,000.
- No.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.600
That's just what we owe with
medical supplies, living expenses, taxes.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.159
- I'm going to have to get a job.
- I don't want to do that.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.368
But you can't work any harder than you are.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.170
- We need you here.
- You have to pay the doctor.

34:24.639 --> 34:27.405
Of course, honey. We're going to find
some way to take care of that.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.087
We've got to pay him.
He helped me. I saw him.

34:44.760 --> 34:48.525
- Is something wrong with Colton?
- Why do you say that?

34:48.600 --> 34:51.251
Because sometimes he sounds weird.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.402
He says Jesus has a horse.

34:53.480 --> 34:57.644
Well, all sisters think
their brothers are weird.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.604
That's just the way it goes. Okay?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.211
All right.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.848
Okay, so, your dad's a preacher.
He knows a lot of things,

35:07.920 --> 35:11.083
but he didn't know that Jesus has a horse.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.965
Didn't know that.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.243
It's beautiful.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.687
Yeah? What color is it?

35:17.800 --> 35:19.529
It's all the colors.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.649
All the colors of the
rainbow are in heaven,

35:22.720 --> 35:26.327
except they're all more.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.882
- More what?
- Just more and brighter.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.526
How do you know about this horse?

35:33.600 --> 35:35.443
Because I saw him in heaven.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.482
You were in heaven?

35:38.560 --> 35:43.282
Dad, can we talk about this tomorrow
because I'm getting really sleepy.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.566
Okay.

35:45.320 --> 35:48.085
Dad, can I sleep in your room tonight?

35:48.800 --> 35:52.247
No. No, we're going to go ahead
and sleep here.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.322
It's late, guys. Come on.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.406
- Open the door!
- Sorry.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.931
Are you asleep?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.287
Colton just told me he went to heaven.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.449
What? When?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.411
Just now.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.129
No, when did he go to heaven?

36:20.960 --> 36:25.488
He said that during his operation,
he left his body,

36:26.560 --> 36:30.246
and he looked back on the operating table
and saw himself.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.083
He has a very beautiful imagination.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.531
I'll do it, too. I'll have the same thing.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.649
Hi, how are you, Rosa? Can we get...
What do you think?

36:47.720 --> 36:49.961
Milkshake.
- Two milkshakes, please.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.802
- How is everything?
- Okay, great.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.450
So, Colton,

36:57.520 --> 37:00.330
I want to ask you about
when the angels sang to you.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.561
Sure.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.801
<i>I was alone, but I wasn't scared.</i>

37:53.520 --> 37:55.124
<i>I was at the church.</i>

37:55.840 --> 37:57.365
<i>The door was closed.</i>

37:57.520 --> 37:59.329
<i>I opened it.</i>

38:12.880 --> 38:16.043
<i>And I saw something wonderful.</i>

38:25.280 --> 38:30.002
<i>Hallelujah</i>

38:31.560 --> 38:33.562
<i>Hallelujah</i>

38:54.600 --> 38:59.162
<i>I saw angels and they were singing to me.</i>

39:10.320 --> 39:13.051
<i>Can we sing We Will Rock You?</i>

39:34.760 --> 39:38.003
Colton, do you know who I am?

39:39.600 --> 39:41.125
You're not afraid?

39:42.120 --> 39:44.487
Nobody here wants to hurt me.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.684
That's right, Colton.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.728
And nobody here ever will.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.005
There are some people here
who want to meet you.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.489
So, what did they sing?

40:14.240 --> 40:18.131
I asked them to sing We <i>Will Rock</i> You,
but they wouldn't.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.687
And they laughed just like that.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.650
Milkshake.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.483
<i>Moreland University,
Department of Psychology,</i>

40:31.560 --> 40:32.686
<i>Chairman's office.</i>

40:32.760 --> 40:35.809
<i>- May I speak with Dr. Slater, please'?
- Are you calling for an appointment?</i>

40:35.880 --> 40:39.248
<i>Yeah. ls there any chance
she could see me today?</i>

40:47.840 --> 40:50.127
- Dr. Slater?
- Yes.

40:50.240 --> 40:53.084
Hi. I'm Todd Burpo.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.481
Yes, please come in.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.887
Thanks for seeing me on short notice.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.885
"Burpo". Are you a
minister over in Imperial?

41:03.960 --> 41:06.247
Yeah. Yes. How'd you know that?

41:06.320 --> 41:09.529
My late husband was religious. Please, sit.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.482
He had heard about a speaker
named Burpo who was very interesting

41:13.560 --> 41:16.040
and he kept badgering me to come hear you.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.566
You're not?

41:17.960 --> 41:20.201
- Not what?
- Religious.

41:20.760 --> 41:23.286
No. Is that a problem?

41:23.520 --> 41:24.567
No.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.890
No, you might offer me a harder opinion,

41:27.960 --> 41:31.248
help me find a more rational
understanding for something.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.690
I have a son who's extremely smart.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.410
And he's sensitive.

41:41.880 --> 41:42.927
And?

41:44.680 --> 41:46.045
He went to heaven.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.324
And then he came back.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.609
- Your son had a near-death experience?
- No, he didn't die.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.411
We checked his surgical reports.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.966
His heart never stopped,
his brain activity never flatlined.

42:03.400 --> 42:06.961
- So, why do you say he went to heaven?
- Because he says he did.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.808
At the point near death,

42:09.920 --> 42:14.130
the body releases hormones that can
induce a state of peace, even bliss.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.329
Our brains fill in the blanks.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.405
Christians see Jesus, Jews see Moses,
Muslims see Muhammad.

42:20.480 --> 42:25.725
Yeah, I read your article, but my son
saw things that I can't really explain.

42:25.800 --> 42:29.282
He saw me praying. He saw me

42:29.760 --> 42:33.810
shouting at God. He saw his mother
in another wing calling friends,

42:33.880 --> 42:37.282
asking them to pray for us.
All the while, he was in surgery.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.327
- Reverend Burpo...
- Todd.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.086
Todd.

42:43.720 --> 42:47.281
Is it unusual for your wife
to call friends in a time of crisis?

42:48.240 --> 42:49.844
No. No, it's not.

42:49.960 --> 42:53.601
And is it unusual for you to pray?
Or become passionate when you do?

42:53.680 --> 42:57.048
No. No. Of course not. But I know my son.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.564
And when he talks about heaven,

42:59.680 --> 43:02.968
it doesn't sound like something
he's making up.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.690
He's very specific. He's four.

43:04.760 --> 43:09.049
- And he's extremely smart.
- Yes. Both of my kids are.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.646
Reverend...

43:12.360 --> 43:16.046
Todd, I don't mean to discount
whatever magic it is

43:16.120 --> 43:20.205
you derive from all of this,
but there are many explanations,

43:20.280 --> 43:22.328
even for extrasensory knowledge.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.444
Is it really easier to believe in that

43:28.520 --> 43:33.970
or clairvoyance or telepathy
than it is life after the physical?

43:34.040 --> 43:35.530
Believe in miracles?

43:36.200 --> 43:38.885
I've found such concepts
to be a bit circular.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.161
Even before I watched my husband die.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.848
Let me ask you,
did you come here today because

43:47.920 --> 43:51.891
you were wondering about my faith?
Or were you wondering about your own?

43:55.120 --> 43:56.770
Thanks for your time.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.771
You're welcome.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.526
What if you have an encounter so far

44:11.600 --> 44:15.969
beyond your own experience that it's

44:18.560 --> 44:19.800
irrational?

44:21.240 --> 44:22.480
What then?

44:45.040 --> 44:47.361
This looks like trouble here.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.807
- Todd, we're so happy about Colton.
- Thank you.

44:49.880 --> 44:53.327
Thanks. Thank you very much.
See you later. Good.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.521
There he is.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.602
- How are you doing, buddy?
- Good. How are you?

45:03.720 --> 45:07.361
How's that Colton doing today?
Is he back to torturing his sister?

45:08.440 --> 45:09.487
Yes.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.766
I need some advice, smart advice.

45:14.360 --> 45:17.011
Well, I am not smart,
so you came to the right guy.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.127
I know that.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.761
Nothing but clumsy,
inaccurate advice available here.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.888
I've been expecting to
see you a little sooner.

45:24.200 --> 45:27.170
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm your banker.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.009
I didn't come here for a loan.

45:30.120 --> 45:33.408
Not the bank's money,
just from a friend to a friend.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.245
Let me help you out, okay?
Nobody would have to know.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.481
I'd know.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.526
I never wanted to be the guy
who stands up there in the pulpit

45:40.600 --> 45:43.331
asking people to give to charity
when all he does is take it.

45:43.400 --> 45:47.883
It's not charity.
It's a loan from a friend to a friend.

45:47.960 --> 45:50.930
I know you need the help.
It's what real people do.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.240
I don't.

45:53.720 --> 45:56.371
Well, then you didn't come here
for smart advice.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.960
I don't think the church has kept
your salary in line with

45:59.040 --> 46:02.362
the new members that you've brought in.
I think you deserve a raise.

46:02.440 --> 46:05.046
Let me talk to the board,
see what I can do.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.521
I didn't come here for a raise, either.

46:07.640 --> 46:12.202
All right. Good. I didn't want to ask them.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.564
What can I do for you?

46:15.880 --> 46:17.086
It's Colton.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.086
He's been talking about this...

46:23.200 --> 46:25.328
We ask these kids to believe this stuff

46:25.400 --> 46:28.210
and I don't even know
if I believe it myself, Jay.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.327
What?

46:37.720 --> 46:42.009
Colton is what I'm trying to tell you about.
He's been saying things I don't understand.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.731
He's talking about these conversations
in heaven.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.401
I used to go out with a flight attendant

46:46.440 --> 46:49.887
whose son had extensive conversations
with Barney the dinosaur.

46:50.520 --> 46:53.205
- Do you know how irritating Barney is?
- Yeah.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.726
- He's purple.
- Exactly, exactly.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.644
The Bible tells us to believe his children.

46:58.920 --> 47:02.288
What my child's telling me
will get me laughed out of this town.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.931
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know what to preach.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.445
I don't have anything to say.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.410
Just speak from the heart, Todd,
like you always do.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.970
<i>What about fear do we struggle with?
Is it confusion?</i>

47:17.240 --> 47:19.641
Is it doubt? Is it questions?

47:19.920 --> 47:21.445
I got questions.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.080
We all do. Maybe we ought to just...

47:26.200 --> 47:28.965
Maybe we ought to try that today.
Just see if...

47:29.040 --> 47:30.929
Do you want to try questions?

47:38.560 --> 47:40.289
- Hey, Todd.
- Yeah?

47:40.800 --> 47:44.600
- My family and I prayed for you a lot.
- Thank you. Thank you, Michael.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.201
We're just wondering, how bad was it?

47:47.760 --> 47:49.842
"How bad?" it was awful.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.482
I mean, a lot of us heard that
Colton died during the operation

47:53.560 --> 47:56.211
and prayers brought him back to life.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.724
No, he didn't die on the operating table.

48:01.040 --> 48:06.001
He, you know, came mighty close,
but I think it was the doctors,

48:06.240 --> 48:09.449
through God and all of your prayers,
that kept him alive

48:09.520 --> 48:11.966
and so thank you all for that.

48:12.600 --> 48:15.570
- So, how did you handle it?
- Not well.

48:15.640 --> 48:20.601
But the important thing is that
the Burpos faced a significant challenge

48:20.680 --> 48:23.081
and they came through it. Amen.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.207
Amen.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.366
That's the thing, though.

48:28.440 --> 48:32.047
Thank you for that, Jay,
but I don't know that I did come through.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.323
Colton's experience makes me wonder.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.562
About what, exactly, Todd?

48:38.640 --> 48:42.565
He's just been telling us about
his experiences, talking

48:45.080 --> 48:46.206
about them.

48:46.280 --> 48:51.047
When he was in the operation,
Colton visited heaven.

48:51.120 --> 48:52.360
But you said he didn't die.

48:52.440 --> 48:56.365
He didn't, but he saw heaven.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.690
- He saw Jesus and angels and...
- But how?

49:00.880 --> 49:02.166
I don't know.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.765
- Reverend Burpo.
- Todd.

49:03.840 --> 49:07.367
Todd. Some of the hospital staff have said,
off the record,

49:07.440 --> 49:11.001
that your son was not expected to survive
and used the word "miracle".

49:11.080 --> 49:15.961
- How would you explain that?
- I haven't even tried to do that.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.441
Can you try?

49:17.720 --> 49:20.166
If he didn't die, how could he see heaven?

49:20.240 --> 49:22.129
I don't know, but he did.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.202
Do you believe he was in heaven?

49:29.080 --> 49:30.809
I know he saw something.

49:32.080 --> 49:33.923
It sure sounded like heaven.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.720
Good Lord,
what's happened to our preacher?

49:52.920 --> 49:55.082
Well, I thought that went well, huh?

49:58.280 --> 49:59.805
Nice view.

50:01.280 --> 50:03.009
I love being up so high.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.008
Colton! Hey!

50:08.080 --> 50:10.811
I thought I asked you
to stop playing with that!

50:11.600 --> 50:15.400
- I'm sorry, Dad!
- I told him not to, Dad!

50:15.600 --> 50:19.241
Half the church wants to stop feeling
and start thinking.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.961
And the other half,
they want the exact opposite.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.325
This is Todd.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.567
Yeah.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.290
Let me call you back.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.964
That was the newspaper.

50:39.680 --> 50:42.809
They want to do an article about heaven.

50:43.760 --> 50:44.807
And?

50:45.280 --> 50:47.442
And they want to interview Colton.

50:48.600 --> 50:50.841
And you think that's a good idea?

50:52.120 --> 50:55.408
So, Colton, a lot of people
were praying for you.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.925
I guess.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.650
Well, that must feel good.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.485
Come over here, buddy.
You're being interviewed.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.601
Thank you.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.085
You were very sick.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.208
What did it feel like to die?

51:11.080 --> 51:13.560
- I didn't die.
- But you went to heaven?

51:14.680 --> 51:16.762
That's a little off-topic.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.650
It's beautiful.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.730
You saw heaven?

51:25.080 --> 51:26.844
What does it look like?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.526
Like here, but even more beautiful.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.725
And you saw Jesus?

51:33.800 --> 51:34.847
Yeah.

51:36.600 --> 51:41.083
He's very nice. I sat on his lap.
He has markers.

51:41.680 --> 51:42.966
Markers?

51:43.360 --> 51:47.888
Yeah. Right here and right here
and right here and right here.

51:49.320 --> 51:51.926
Can I go swing on the swing some more?

51:52.360 --> 51:53.407
Yeah.

51:57.760 --> 52:00.650
So, Jesus has a horse?

52:01.600 --> 52:04.001
There are lots of animals in heaven.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.531
They don't believe me, do they?

52:16.640 --> 52:19.086
Some people might be afraid to believe.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.968
- What are they afraid of?
- I don't know.

52:23.680 --> 52:26.251
Maybe they're afraid
that there's no heaven.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.201
Or maybe they're afraid that there is.

52:29.880 --> 52:33.009
You believe me, Daddy, don't you?

52:35.040 --> 52:39.090
I believe God loves you. And so do I.

52:39.520 --> 52:41.522
Can I get your picture?

52:42.040 --> 52:44.327
- What's that?
- Can I take your picture?

52:45.480 --> 52:46.527
Yeah.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.171
And...

52:51.480 --> 52:52.970
Thank you.

53:03.400 --> 53:07.007
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Jay. Have you seen this?

53:07.120 --> 53:09.282
<i>Yeah, I read it a couple of times.</i>

53:09.480 --> 53:11.164
It's quite an article.

53:11.240 --> 53:13.971
<i>I love Todd, but I love our church, too.</i>

53:14.040 --> 53:17.840
And I really can't stand to see it
turn into some kind of circus.

53:18.440 --> 53:22.047
<i>- Why don't we get together?
- Yeah,</i> I <i>think that's</i> a <i>good idea.</i>

53:22.120 --> 53:23.804
<i>- Okay,</i> thank you.
- Okay.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.803
- Bye-bye.
- All right, bye-bye.

53:32.520 --> 53:35.649
No, that's okay.
Actually, I'm going to get out of here.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.483
No, no. It's on me, buddy.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.130
- What do you mean?
- It's on me.

53:40.200 --> 53:42.521
- No. No. No. No. I got this.
- No. It's on me.

53:42.600 --> 53:46.207
Sonja gives Rosa clothes for Miguelito
whenever Colton outgrows anything.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.841
And she gave Lucia a baby dress that
an angel would wear.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.810
- A pink dress?
- Yeah, beautiful.

53:55.920 --> 53:58.491
So, please, give me the
gift of giving back.

53:58.760 --> 54:00.728
Okay. Thanks a lot.

54:00.840 --> 54:02.444
- All right.
- Bye. Bye, sweetie.

54:02.520 --> 54:03.806
Say bye. bye.

54:06.560 --> 54:08.403
Hey. Hey, Burpo.

54:08.480 --> 54:11.051
Hey, next time there's a fire,
maybe you should tell Jesus that

54:11.120 --> 54:15.045
instead of walking on the water,
he could just dump it all on your fire.

54:17.480 --> 54:18.527
Right?

54:21.120 --> 54:24.727
Come on. You gotta see the humor in it.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.968
Kayla, pass it to me.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.324
Come on. Yeah.

54:42.280 --> 54:46.569
Hey, Cassie, did your brother
really sit on Jesus' lap?

54:46.640 --> 54:48.563
Did he ask for a new bicycle

54:48.840 --> 54:50.763
or a magic DOW?

55:15.480 --> 55:17.403
Hello. This is Todd.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.047
Yeah.

55:23.880 --> 55:25.962
Well, I'm surprised to hear that.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.440
Can you hold on?

55:30.520 --> 55:33.126
Honey, did you punch
a kid in the nose today?

55:34.640 --> 55:36.642
With your fist?

55:37.040 --> 55:38.405
In the nose?

55:38.760 --> 55:39.807
Yep.

55:41.760 --> 55:44.604
But not one kid. Two.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.168
What was the reason, honey?

55:47.280 --> 55:49.521
She hits good when she wants to.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.682
I'm sorry. Can I call you right back?

55:51.760 --> 55:54.843
No, honey. I think we should
talk about this right now.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.528
If you punched somebody,
there must have been a good reason for it.

55:58.600 --> 56:01.251
They were making fun of Colton.

56:01.320 --> 56:04.608
They made fun about him
sitting on Jesus' lap.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.483
Honey, you know you should have
turned the other cheek, though, right?

56:11.560 --> 56:14.609
I did turn his other cheek. When I hit him.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.647
Is Cassie going to get a spanking?

56:20.040 --> 56:21.485
Heck, no.

56:21.560 --> 56:25.201
I'm just going to teach her to hit
without hurting her knuckles.

56:46.560 --> 56:47.641
Hey-

56:55.520 --> 56:57.522
Are you having trouble sleeping?

56:57.640 --> 56:59.642
No. Are you?

57:02.360 --> 57:03.566
Yeah.

57:05.720 --> 57:08.963
It's pretty cool what
Cassie did today, huh?

57:16.120 --> 57:19.010
Yeah. It's pretty cool.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.845
Do you want to talk?

57:24.200 --> 57:25.247
Sure.

57:25.600 --> 57:27.887
Great. I like our talks.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.364
Can we talk about heaven?

57:32.440 --> 57:34.283
What would you like to know?

57:35.240 --> 57:37.129
What did Jesus look like?

57:37.200 --> 57:39.601
He's kind of hard to describe.

57:40.680 --> 57:41.966
I'll bet.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.645
Did he look

57:45.560 --> 57:48.040
maybe like a picture you've seen?

57:49.920 --> 57:51.285
How about...

57:59.280 --> 58:03.251
- Did he look like that?
- The clothes. Not the face.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.211
This one?

58:09.240 --> 58:12.847
- This?
- No. Jesus has light eyes.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.411
What color?

58:16.600 --> 58:19.126
Bluish or green.

58:19.200 --> 58:20.850
Bluish-greenish.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.210
- Here.
- Hey.

58:30.280 --> 58:33.170
- Did you get enough sleep?
- Not much.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.606
So, he says that Jesus has light eyes.

58:39.240 --> 58:42.164
Greenish blue.
Yours are green, mine are blue.

58:42.680 --> 58:44.409
He's seeing us.

58:44.720 --> 58:46.722
It's quite a compliment, really.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.205
In college, I read something about

58:52.280 --> 58:56.524
our own personal concept of God
comes from our feelings about our father.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.850
I sure hope not. Mine had issues.

59:01.960 --> 59:07.171
If our kids, they grow up believing that
they are loved the way you love them,

59:08.600 --> 59:10.648
the luckiest kids alive.

59:22.240 --> 59:24.971
- We've got a fire.
- We sure have.

59:26.920 --> 59:30.970
I'm going to take care of that one,
come home, and add to this, all right?

59:38.880 --> 59:40.166
I'll be here.

59:53.080 --> 59:55.321
- Get two hoses on that car!
- No, no, no.

59:55.400 --> 59:57.084
- They're in there!
- Who?

59:57.160 --> 59:58.844
My family, they're in there!

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.922
- You've got a search?
- Yeah, he's saying they're in there.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.243
Todd, you're in.
Let's go, let's run another one.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.084
Here, you'll need this.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.400
Keep him back.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.885
Let's go, let's go!

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.691
- That's hot! That's hot!
- You can't go in there!

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.651
Hello? Is anyone here?

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.926
Hello?

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.002
It's clear! It's clear!

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.684
Charge. Clear. Shock.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.768
Charge. Clear. Shock.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.127
Colton, this is just a visit,

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.409
but before you go back,
I want you to meet someone.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.042
I heard you gave Michael and Rosa
a baby present.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.331
Yeah, I thought they could use it.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.205
- Let's go out.
- What?

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.727
Yeah. Call Sheila. She'll watch them.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.006
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.411
Honey, no, we can't afford it.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.131
That charity auction last
year, dinner for two.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.920
Maple Grove restaurant,
your favorite place.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.689
- We used that already.
- No, we did not.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.969
- We did. What are you doing?
- No, we did not. We did not.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.289
The darker the night,
the brighter they are.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.411
Like you.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.444
Yeah, you're good.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.244
It's my best stuff.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.849
It's getting darker, though.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.924
We're out of money.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.529
We're out of credit, too.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.685
And the church board called me today.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.249
They want to sit down with you
and talk about where we're at as a church.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.209
Why didn't they call me?

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.289
I don't think they wanted you to think that
they were putting you on the spot.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.040
Because they are putting you on the spot.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.721
Todd, we're prepared for you
to have all kinds of struggles,

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.610
and we're here to support you
during those times.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.130
We've extended a leave of absence.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.208
- Twice.
- Twice, right.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.841
So, I think you're aware the church
is not doing very well without you

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.200
and so we need to know
what to plan for in the close future.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.084
The question for me isn't whether you're
preaching, it's what you're preaching.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.847
Colton's trip to heaven disturbs
a lot of people. it disturbs me.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.003
Do you take it as a literal event?

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.003
Well, for him, it's not imaginary.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.927
It's not a metaphor or a feeling.
It happened.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.766
And I take that seriously. I just
don't know what to make of it. You know?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.730
What about it bothers you so much?

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.283
What is it? I mean, I want to talk about it.
I need to talk about it.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.091
All right. I don't like that it feels like

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.610
some fairy tale,

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.004
just a simple, easy explanation of life.
I don't like that.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.761
Okay. So, because it appeals
to simple people?

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.326
No. No. Yeah.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.887
Okay. I don't like how it makes our church

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.930
a magnet for everyone who
wants to take the brain out of their head

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.400
and beat it to death with the Bible

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.808
and then seem to want to show off
how much they believe.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.441
Heaven and hell have always been concepts

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.490
that have been used to control
and frighten people.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.851
That's one way to look at it, but

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.841
all Colton's ever talked about is heaven
and how it's a beautiful place.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.325
Todd, what do you plan on preaching?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.370
All of us have times when we lose our way.
That's when we look to leaders.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.326
If you're going to lead this church,
you've got to make a decision.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.686
All right. I say that we give
Todd a little bit more time.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.004
One more week.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.370
But in the meantime, we need to start
planning for the future of our church

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.761
and looking for someone else.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.001
Here you go. B-U-R-P-O.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.605
Yeah, we've got everything ready
to settle your account today.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.686
I can't do that today.
I had an unforeseen situation.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.640
- You're not going to settle today?
- Not today.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.002
Well, you are aware that we have
extended your accounts twice already.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.321
- I think it's been one extension.
- No, it's been twice.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.607
And they are going to collections
as we speak.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.968
Okay, but the collections
is not something that...

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.725
Hey, Colton.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.447
Hospital policy demands that I tell you
your account is going to collections.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.925
Colton.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.086
Colton!

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.884
Hey, come here.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.041
Colton!

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.567
- I need to tell them. Please.
- Come here.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.890
Yes, sweetie.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.725
They don't look like that.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.208
It's all right. No one will ever hurt you.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.083
Come on, guys, WW UP-

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.322
Mom's got a music conference today.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.401
Hurry, hurry-

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.485
Hey, you didn't tell me
how the church board meeting went.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.926
They've started looking for somebody else.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.525
Guys, let's go, come on.
Go brush your teeth.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.207
Well, we'll figure it out.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.645
You didn't come to bed
until it was almost dawn.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.520
I was researching near-death experiences.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.603
- Are you all right?
- It's fine!

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.283
- It's fine. I mean, don't you think that...
- Hey! What?

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:47.160
We need to be talking about this life?
Not the next one.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.368
I'm right here.
What do you want to talk about?

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:53.604
We need to make sure
our children are safe and they are happy.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.008
- And that they are normal!
- Happy, yes! And normal! I agree!

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:05.006
I have to go out to that
service for that loner

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.527
who died after the fire in his motor home.
He didn't have any friends or next of kin.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.365
- You've got Colton today.
- I'm going to take him with me.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.566
Great.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:18.410
He's never been freaked out
in those situations. He's a lot of comfort.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.403
For the dead man or for you?

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.926
Touché.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:25.925
Touché. Touché.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.921
Our Father who art in heaven,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.729
hallowed be Thy name.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.645
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.764
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.002
Give us this day, our daily bread.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.921
Aim. Begin.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.442
- You had a grandpa named "Pop", right?
- That's right.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.804
Was he your daddy's daddy
or your mommy's daddy?

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.283
He was my mom's dad.
He died when I was about your age.

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.370
He's very nice.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.724
You saw Pop? You saw my grandfather?

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.845
You saw him?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.645
- Where did you see him?
- In heaven.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.811
I loved my grandfather very much.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.724
He was there with me
when my father couldn't be.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.090
He taught me to weld.
He gave me that slingshot.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.721
I know. We play with it.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.321
That's right. And he was a good man.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.327
He was a really good man,
but I don't know what he believed in.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.244
None of us did.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.526
I think

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.090
he's one of the reasons
your dad became a minister.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.411
I was hoping he would get a break
getting into heaven then.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.046
You don't have to worry, Dad. He's there.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.529
He came up to me and told me he was
your grandfather and you called him "Pop".

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.809
And he held me in his lap
just like Jesus did.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.850
And he told me everything was all right.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.247
Okay, look at this.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.807
Is this him? Is this the man you saw?

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.962
No. That's not who I saw.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.011
Okay, but just look. Are you sure? Colton?

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.448
Nobody wears glasses in heaven.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.688
Can I go play?
Because when Mom gets home...

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.603
Are you sure that's not him?

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.810
- It's not him.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.645
- When Mom gets home...
- Mom will be home in a second.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.722
Just wait one second. Wait.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.126
Colton?

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.164
That's him. That's Pop.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.966
In heaven, everybody's young.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.603
Are you okay, Dad?

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.407
An awful lot happened to you in heaven.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.801
Yeah, it was amazing.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.563
Todd, dinner is going
to be ready in five...

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.730
Are you okay?

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.404
Colton saw Pop.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.928
In heaven. My grandfather.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.082
I don't know what to make of this.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.766
Well, I don't have the luxury
of not knowing, Sonja.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.320
I don't. Everything he tells me,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.561
it hits me, you know?
And I want to believe him.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.845
Okay, I want to believe him. He's four.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.651
He's four. He's so innocent,
he can't be making this up,

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:52.326
but everything he talks
about is impossible.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.447
It is a massive adventure
that he's created.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.922
He's talking about Jesus,
seeing Jesus' horse.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.890
He talks about choirs of angels
and my grandfather.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.762
It would take weeks or days,
but, "For God a day is a thousand years."

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.049
"And a thousand years but a day."
I'm just saying that's scripture.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.202
It's scripture. There's no clock.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.601
There's no clock.
Einstein talks about the same thing.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.520
- "Some reality is beyond time."
- Why can't it just be a mystery?

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.009
Because I think God might be
trying to reach out to us through Colton.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.127
That's what I think.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.125
What Colton is telling us, Todd,
is an echo of every story,

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.568
every song, every image
he's seen since he was a child.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.650
Why does this have to be a myth? Why?

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.369
I don't know. I don't know how to move on

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.805
with my life.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.324
Tell me what to do.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.925
I don't know.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.641
All I care about is if my husband
and my family know that I love them.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.923
I'm sorry I can't help
you with any of this.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.483
Well, I'm here.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.325
Where are you?

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.203
Please accept this flag
as a symbol of our appreciation

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.045
for your loved one's
honorable and faithful service.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.567
Your son was a hero. He
died a brave marine.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.321
You.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.926
I always figured it was Jay leaving

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.083
flags and flowers here on my son's grave.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.163
I failed you, Nancy.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.410
The worst moment of your life,

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.525
loss beyond comprehension, and I had...

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.170
I had nothing for you.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.290
No comfort.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.206
No hope.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.205
No peace.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.124
- I should have maybe...
- No, you didn't let me down.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.443
You couldn't take my pain away
and I didn't want it gone.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.241
For a while, pain was all I had of him.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.326
You don't have to save the world, Todd.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.646
I believe that's already been done.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.122
Since that meeting at the church

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.724
where I was the bitter woman
I swore I'd never be,

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.210
I've been thinking.

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.010
It's not the people of
the church I'm mad at.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.322
And it's not you. Not your son.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.685
It's God.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:14.163
Why God would give you your son back
and take mine away.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.682
When Colton was in that hospital,

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.164
I saw he was dying

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.602
and some part of me broke.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.446
Some part that still hasn't mended.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.170
Nancy, you don't ever
have to apologize to me

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.561
for any broken part you carry.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.804
Do you think...

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.930
I have to ask.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.771
Do you think my son went to heaven?

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.041
Do you love your son still?

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.885
Of course.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.608
- Do you think I love mine?
- I know you do.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.767
Do you think I love my son
more than you love yours?

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.640
No.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:34.487
Do you think God loves my son
more than he loves yours?

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.044
Mommy?

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.645
Yes, Colton.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.643
Did you know I have a sister?

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.290
Yes, Colton, of course,
I know you have a sister.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.325
I didn't know.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.011
You didn't know that Cassie is your sister?

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.681
No, I have two sisters.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.123
You had a baby die in your tummy,
didn't you?

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.450
Honey, who told you
I had a baby die in my tummy?

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.570
She told me she died in your tummy.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.609
What does she look like?

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.365
Like Cassie, but a little smaller.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.728
And hair like yours.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.846
In heaven, this little girl came up to me
and she wouldn't stop hugging me.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.967
Honey, what did... What was her name?

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.527
She didn't have a name.
You guys didn't name her.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.127
You're right. We didn't. We...

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.646
We didn't know that she was a "she".

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.567
- Are you okay, Mommy?
- Yeah.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.202
We lost a baby, sweetheart,

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.042
just a few months before she was...

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.881
Todd.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.086
That's our baby. That's our little girl.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.765
She's okay.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.211
I don't want to be late for school today
and the phone's ringing!

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.691
I'll get it.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.087
- H <i>i.
- Pastor Todd Burpo?</i>

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.241
This is Todd.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.243
<i>Great. We're live on the
air with Todd Burpo.</i>

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.527
<i>Can you tell us about
your son's adventure in heaven?</i>

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.125
- On the air?
- Dad!

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.607
<i>Everybody here in Imperial
followed the story of your son's sickness</i>

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:38.001
<i>and people all over town
were praying for his recovery.</i>

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.845
<i>Now we're starting to hear of
an amazing trip he took to heaven.</i>

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.127
<i>Can you tell us about that?</i>

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.931
Come by Crossroads Wesleyan Church
on Sunday.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.122
I'll tell you all about it.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.888
<i>Here's my heart now</i>

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.441
<i>Take and seal it</i>

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:09.044
<i>Seal it for Thy courts above</i>

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.042
<i>Here's my heart now</i>

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.723
<i>Take and seal it</i>

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.171
<i>Seal it for Thy courts</i>

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.300
<i>Above</i>

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.165
I love you.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.403
I'm standing here today with
wounds that are still healing,

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.047
fears that are still echoing

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.926
and in that way, maybe some of you are
sitting here this morning exactly like me.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.686
I can say truthfully that
the pain that I suffered,

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:07.609
it was nothing compared to
watching my son that close to death.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.841
So, now we've got a question.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.929
Was Colton in heaven?

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.206
Yes.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.360
He was in the heaven that God showed him.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.204
Is heaven real?

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.767
'Cause, if heaven is for real,

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.489
we'd all lead different lives, wouldn't we?

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.131
Would we?

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.010
Really? Haven't we already seen heaven?

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:48.927
In the first cry of a baby,
the courage of a friend,

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.685
the hands of a nurse or a doctor,
the love of a mother or father.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:26:00.166
Haven't we already had a glimpse
of heaven and so often chosen the hell

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.244
of hate and fear?

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.162
Is heaven for real? Every single
one of you has asked that question.

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.164
All of us have. And for me, the answer...

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.245
It's "yes."

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.969
I see it, so I believe it.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.604
And what we believe
changes what we perceive.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.288
And I believe that God, he's love.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:33.684
Ten thousand times I've been here
and I've talked about

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.728
"On earth as it is in heaven."

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.130
And I don't know that I
ever listened to that.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.002
And my son, he saw something.
He saw heaven.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.168
He'll tell you all about Jesus.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.042
How about that name? "Jesus."

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.291
"Jesus?

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:02.211
It creates so much hope in so many of you,

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.641
so much distrust in so many others.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.530
That's okay.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.090
I believe God asked me to be a pastor.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.484
Did he insist on my vision
being the same as yours? Or yours?

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.131
Of course not.
Did he make me one those heroes like

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.761
that lion and the bear and unicorn
I preached about?

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.845
No. That's what I wanted.
God had a different plan.

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.567
God crushed my pride.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.084
He opened my heart

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.570
to love.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.248
And all I have to do,

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.608
the one thing this love requires

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.445
is that I let others
know they're not alone.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.968
So amazing.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.121
Welcome back. Good work, buddy.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.082
It's good to see you.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.400
Hey, Randy.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.404
Are things okay over there?

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.649
What? What? What was that?

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.411
- Hey, thanks very much, John.
- You're welcome.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.887
Thanks. You, too. I am.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.290
Hey, Ray.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.722
<i>She picked up the brush
when she was just six years old.</i>

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.210
<i>But the visions...</i>

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.288
- Mom, can I have some lemonade, please?
- Of course.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.601
<i>Started when she was just four.</i>

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.490
- Look <i>at this on</i> CNN.
<i>- She's</i> a <i>self-taught painter.</i>

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.562
It's about a girl on the
other side of the world

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.166
who had an experience a lot like Colton's.

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.882
She saw visions of heaven.
Look at this. Angels.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.285
<i>She began to describe to her mother
in great detail...</i>

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.771
Look at this, honey. This is incredible.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.569
<i>Her visits to heaven.</i>

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.411
- It's nice, honey, but I have got to talk to you.
- Okay.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:24.931
Okay, but she's...

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.005
At the age of four,
she began to describe her visits to heaven.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.521
See?

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:41.843
Colton? Are you okay?

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.690
That's him.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.245
That's...

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.405
But... Colton.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.089
That's him?

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.683
That's who you saw? Colton, come here.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.889
- I've got to talk to you.
- Come on. This is...

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.291
Hey, I want to talk to you.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.801
He told me that painting back there
that girl saw is what Colton saw.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.963
Todd, you know that little baby-blue
outfit we keep in the drawer?

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.611
Todd, we're going to need this.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.926
Really?

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.450
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.164
- Wow.
- I know.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.484
- Wow, when did you find out?
- Yesterday.
