00:04.308 --> 00:04.526
.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.310
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.354 --> 00:07.746
sexually based offenses

00:07.790 --> 00:09.922
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.966 --> 00:12.490
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:12.534 --> 00:14.275
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:14.318 --> 00:15.711
are members of an elite squad

00:15.754 --> 00:17.843
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.541
These are their stories.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.153
- [chuckles]

00:23.197 --> 00:24.415
All right.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.982
Come on, everybody.
Listen up. Listen up.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.940
- Quiet!
- All right, guys.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.246
I'd love to say a few words,

00:29.290 --> 00:31.814
but don't worry,
I'll make it short.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.207
Get over here, Fin.

00:34.817 --> 00:38.168
So over the past 22 years,

00:38.212 --> 00:41.824
I have had the privilege
of bearing witness

00:41.867 --> 00:45.132
to all that Sergeant Tutuola
has accomplished.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.177
- Benson's getting all misty.
- Oh, just wait.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.614
- So, you know,
we all love

00:49.658 --> 00:53.140
Fin's sort of easy,
laid-back attitude

00:53.183 --> 00:55.098
and a sarcasm that is so sharp

00:55.142 --> 00:57.405
that it could cut
a person's brake line.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.233
- Take it easy.
- OK.

00:59.276 --> 01:03.019
But those of us who have
been in the trenches with Fin

01:03.063 --> 01:07.937
know that he is truly
a walking redemption story.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.808
Fin was raised in Harlem.

01:09.852 --> 01:13.464
And at the tender age
of six years old,

01:13.508 --> 01:17.077
he witnessed
his own mother's murder.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.340
And the reason I say that

01:19.383 --> 01:21.951
is because Fin worked
through his own pain

01:21.994 --> 01:24.214
and was determined

01:24.258 --> 01:27.217
to help other people
work through theirs.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.741
So he became a cop.

01:29.785 --> 01:33.396
He joined the Narcotics Squad,
and fortunately for us,

01:33.441 --> 01:36.226
found that his talents
were better suited for SVU.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.401
So, Fin,
I just want you to know

01:37.445 --> 01:40.143
that you're not fooling anyone.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.102
And underneath
that tough façade

01:42.145 --> 01:46.410
is a kind and compassionate man

01:46.454 --> 01:49.587
who has bravely
triumphed over his trauma

01:49.631 --> 01:52.938
and used it for so much good.

01:52.982 --> 01:55.941
So will you all join me

01:55.985 --> 01:58.596
in raising a glass

01:58.640 --> 02:02.992
to this year's winner
of the Harlem Heart Award

02:03.035 --> 02:08.824
but also to the enduring power
of redemption?

02:08.866 --> 02:11.696
Sergeant Odafin Tutuola!

02:11.740 --> 02:14.786
[cheering]

who this Fin guy is

02:16.788 --> 02:18.268
you've been
talking about all night,

02:18.312 --> 02:21.141
but I will try
to fill his shoes.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.492
[laughter]

02:24.535 --> 02:26.929
- I am so proud of you.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.368
- Hey. Congratulations, Fin.
- Thanks, man.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.935
- Recognition
looks good on you.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.371
- Better than a lawsuit.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.199
- I'm so sorry that Phoebe
couldn't be here tonight.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.722
- She had to work.
- Yeah, Rollins too.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.420
- I'm just glad
you guys made it.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.944
- Well, so are we.
So much fun.

02:41.987 --> 02:45.295
Hey, uh, anybody want a water?
- I'll join you.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.167
I got to relieve the sitter
in ten minutes.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.559
All right, Fin.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.344
- Let's get that halo
a little dirty tonight, huh?

02:50.387 --> 02:51.388
How about it?

02:51.432 --> 02:52.954
- Old buddy of yours?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.478
- Back in the day,
the perps weren't the only ones

02:54.522 --> 02:55.914
with the vices, right?

02:55.958 --> 02:58.178
[laughter]

03:04.271 --> 03:06.186
- You have fun?
- Yeah, I did.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.491
- Good.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.927
- It was pretty unexpected

03:08.971 --> 03:10.973
to see all those hard-asses
from my old precinct.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.454
- Well, they all love you.
- I got 'em fooled.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.498

I got it. I got it.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.113
I have an idea.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.419
How about I drive you home?

03:22.463 --> 03:23.942
- How about that?

03:26.336 --> 03:27.990
Whew!

03:28.033 --> 03:29.948
Guess I'm more of a lightweight
than I thought.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.429
- Well, you're allowed
to have a good time, Fin,

03:32.473 --> 03:34.344
especially tonight.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.954
- I really want to thank you

03:35.998 --> 03:38.305
for the nice stuff
you said about me tonight, Liv.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.089
- Well, I meant them.

03:40.132 --> 03:43.353
And I want to thank you
for being so steady.

03:43.397 --> 03:46.356
You know, Fin,
there's been so much change.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.228
And I know
that it hasn't been easy.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.273

03:50.317 --> 03:52.319
got to find the balance
in this job.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.016

03:54.059 --> 03:55.365
- Well, it hasn't been easy.

03:55.409 --> 03:58.063
I've done some things
I'm not too proud of.

03:58.107 --> 04:02.459
- Well, fortunately, you don't
have to have a great past

04:02.503 --> 04:04.896
to have a great future.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.376
Good night.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.402
You want to tell me
how you got in here?

05:59.446 --> 06:02.013
- They sell lock picking sets
on Amazon.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.842
But Amazon wasn't even a thing
when you put me away.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.802

- 23 years ago.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.107

Dub Nichols, did.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.118
I thought about it
every damn day I was in jail.

That's a long time.

06:22.991 --> 06:23.992
What did me and Dub
pick you up for?

06:24.035 --> 06:25.385

06:25.428 --> 06:27.343
- Well, that was back
in my Narcotics days.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.736
It must have been
a drug arrest.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.434
- East 12th Street, Grandpa.
- Nothing personal,

06:31.478 --> 06:34.132

All you cops do is lie.

1999.

You were carrying
several packages

06:58.505 --> 06:59.810

07:01.508 --> 07:03.814
Just got accepted

07:05.337 --> 07:06.469
to pay their way
through college.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.123
You decided to sell tab.

07:10.342 --> 07:12.475
But then again, so did you.

of drugs in a school zone.

Never.

Everything that happened to me

I'm with you, all right?

the minute you tackled me

off the pavement.

I tried to get you off,

It wasn't Dub's fault.

You think that I don't know
that you left Narcotics?

with Special Victims now?

in the Tombs, by myself.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.576
- That's because you were 17.

That night, the cell unlocks.

stupid moment,

coming to take me home.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.079
and I mean ugly,

He pushed me face down
on my cot.

He made me bite a rag.

And, like,
it hurt, like, so much.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.616

09:40.405 --> 09:42.320

09:42.364 --> 09:45.628
Right after Cream Cheese
was finished,

09:45.672 --> 09:50.154
he burned this H into my skin
with a hot paper clip.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.289
He marked me, man.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.770
- You report that?

09:56.813 --> 10:01.165
- I stumbled out of my cell,
and I asked the CO for help.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.820
You know what he said?

10:03.864 --> 10:06.518
"Go back inside and wash up.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.868
You stink."

10:07.911 --> 10:10.479
That's when I knew.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.481
- He let him into your cell.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.918
- Yeah.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.441
And then a few years back,

10:16.485 --> 10:21.490
off some chomo up in Green
Haven that you locked up,

10:21.533 --> 10:24.841
I come to find out you
investigate crimes like this.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.322
You know what you are, man?

10:27.365 --> 10:30.064
You're a hypocrite.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.336
- Is that gun
even loaded, Dutch?

10:49.997 --> 10:52.956
- [sobbing]

10:53.000 --> 10:55.872
- What do you want
from me, man?

10:55.915 --> 10:59.093
- I want justice.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.312
I want the ones
who did this to me.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.446
- I can help you with that.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.841
And let's get that CO
who let him do this to you.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.723
You don't know
Cream Cheese's name?

11:20.767 --> 11:23.378
- I never saw him
after that night.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.162
He must have been
transferred out.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.642
- What about the CO?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.600
- I was in shock.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.560
My public defender told me
to plead guilty.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.431
- I'm not gonna
lie to you, man.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.433
You got railroaded.

11:35.477 --> 11:38.480
OK, Dutch.
Here's what we're gonna do.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.483
You come into SVU with me
first thing in the morning,

11:41.526 --> 11:45.095
file a report, and I'll
personally take it from there.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.750
- You don't understand.

11:47.794 --> 11:51.841
When they moved me upstate,
I was a marked man.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.365
Everyone seemed to know.

11:54.409 --> 11:58.326
This brand made me a punk.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.459
I was gang raped,
passed around,

12:01.503 --> 12:05.246
lent, sold, and bartered.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.031
They made me grow my hair
and wear pigtails.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.686
- OK, Dutch, I'm gonna need you
explain something to me.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.994
You say you were assaulted many
times, by many different guys.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.866
Why is it you only want
to go after Cream Cheese?

12:16.910 --> 12:19.129
- He broke me.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.523
If I hadn't been raped
in holding,

12:21.566 --> 12:23.786
I might have had a chance
in Green Haven.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.657
- You're smart.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.659
You would have figured out
a way to survive.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.793
- First things first,
Detective Tutuola--

12:30.837 --> 12:31.794
- Sergeant.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.277
What's that H stand for?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.237
- I always thought
"homosexual."

12:40.281 --> 12:43.327
- For all you know,
the guy's name is Harry.

12:43.371 --> 12:47.549
- Like I said,
Sergeant, I need help.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.160
But I'm not waiting
till tomorrow.

12:50.204 --> 12:53.903
23 years is long enough,
don't you think?

12:53.947 --> 12:57.602
- OK, first thing,

12:57.646 --> 13:01.389
I'ma see if I can
find a shirt that fits you.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.826
I'll try to help you,
but I'm not gonna be able

13:03.870 --> 13:06.089
to do this alone.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.961
And you can call me Fin.

13:18.362 --> 13:18.754
.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.973
- Who's this?

13:20.016 --> 13:22.323
- This is Detective Bruno.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.804
- How are you doing?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.109
- Why should I trust this guy?

13:26.153 --> 13:27.850
- Doesn't matter.
I trust him.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.852
Now, you want our help or not?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.462
- Does Pinocchio have
little wooden balls?

13:31.506 --> 13:33.856
- [chuckles]

13:33.900 --> 13:35.553
- Bruno sounds
like a dog's name.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.338
- [scoffs]

13:37.381 --> 13:40.732
Just tell us
what you remember about the CO.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.519
- I don't like to relive it.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.826
- Well, you're gonna have
to, at least for tonight.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.349
Even if it hurts.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.396
- Listen.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.008
I know guys don't like
talking about stuff like this,

13:55.051 --> 13:57.837
but believe me,
we've heard it all.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.365
The Tombs have been closed
for a minute,

14:04.408 --> 14:06.715
but these are pics of
all the COs that worked there

14:06.758 --> 14:08.238
the year you were incarcerated.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.892
- I've been looking through
a couple of dozen bald guys

14:09.936 --> 14:10.937
with dad bod.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.199
I'm losing my appetite.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.288
- Yo, Dutch.
Dutch, focus, man.

14:14.331 --> 14:15.767
- There's not many more.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.262
- What do you see?

14:32.306 --> 14:33.568
- That him?

14:33.611 --> 14:35.657
- He's a lot older now.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.789
But yeah, that's him.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.356
The CO who unlocked my cell.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.491
- Pete Ryan.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.710
- He still working?
- He's at Rikers now.

14:45.754 --> 14:48.104
Says here he was promoted
to captain a few years back.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.802
- What do you say we go
pay this guy a visit?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.159
[knocks at door]

15:02.640 --> 15:04.773
Captain Ryan?

15:04.816 --> 15:06.253
- Who's asking?

15:06.296 --> 15:09.952
- I'm Sergeant Tutuola.
This is Detective Bruno, SVU.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.172
We're hoping you can
help us out with an old case.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.000
- We coming at a bad time?

15:14.043 --> 15:15.610
- Well, it's a little late,
isn't it?

15:15.653 --> 15:17.003
- This won't take long.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.656
- You'll be back to your
regularly scheduled program

15:18.700 --> 15:20.093
in no time.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.793
- Get you fellas anything else?
- No. We're good, Patty.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.316
Thanks.
- Thank you.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.147
- 23-year-old sexual assault
at the Tombs?

15:31.191 --> 15:32.888
I don't see how I can help you.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.585
- Well, the vic
ID'd the accomplice.

15:34.629 --> 15:38.241
It was a CO.
1999, 2000.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.895
- Vic ID'd him off a picture?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.462
- Yeah.

15:41.505 --> 15:44.160
- Let me see.
Maybe it'll trigger my memory.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.949
[phone unlocks]

15:52.212 --> 15:53.604
This some sort of joke?

15:53.648 --> 15:56.259
- Look like we're laughing?

15:56.303 --> 15:58.914
- Look, I let you guys in here
out of respect for the badge.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.743
But you know what?
That's it. I'm done here.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.092
- We're not.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.928
- Uh...

16:12.972 --> 16:15.017
- Look at him.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.497
Look at him.

16:16.540 --> 16:20.762
Street name Dutch.
Real name Ivan Hernandez.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.851
Not even 18 at the time.

16:22.894 --> 16:26.594
Now, he just had the guts to
look at your picture earlier.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.204
You at least owe him that.

16:31.686 --> 16:32.992
- Look familiar?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.167
- You know how many scumbags
we used to get

16:34.210 --> 16:35.777
coming through the Tombs?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.735
- There it is, man.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.172
That mildewy smell.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.783
- Yeah, a real stench.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.698
- I never raped anybody.
- We know.

16:43.741 --> 16:46.527
- We also know you gave the guy
who did a key to his cell.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.094
Now, you give up a name,
we may be able

16:48.137 --> 16:49.878
to work something out
with the DA.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.401
[plate shatters]

16:53.447 --> 16:54.622
- The DA?

16:54.665 --> 16:57.016
- Patty, it's all right.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.018
- You guys get out of here.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.237
And leave my husband alone.
He's a good man.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.766
- That guy was rattled.

17:08.810 --> 17:09.984
- But no cuffs?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.595
I thought you said
you'd fix this.

17:11.638 --> 17:14.511
- We will.
These things take time.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.738
That's Ryan's wife.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.348
She's in a hurry.

17:26.393 --> 17:30.049
- Where the hell is she going
at this time of night?

17:35.184 --> 17:37.360
[tires screeching]

17:43.105 --> 17:46.195
[sirens wailing]

17:56.988 --> 17:58.381
What the hell is this place?

17:58.425 --> 18:00.601
- Some kind of
sober living facility.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.125
- Maybe she just developed
a drinking problem.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.474
- I have that effect on people.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.956
- Are you guys gonna
do something, or what?

18:07.999 --> 18:09.610
- Hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.444
- Are we gonna roll inside and
find out who she's talking to?

18:17.487 --> 18:20.751
- Not until I call Benson
and bring her up to speed.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.275
That's a captain's wife.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.668
I'm not taking any chances
with protocol.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.803
- What the hell
are you doing up?

18:28.846 --> 18:30.152
- You know what they say.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.588
The world is full
of good people.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.503
If you can't find one, be one.
- OK.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.376
But do you have to do it when
the rest of us are sleeping?

18:36.419 --> 18:38.160
- This guy hasn't had
a good night's sleep

18:38.204 --> 18:39.292
in over 20 years.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.207
Me? I haven't missed a wink.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.034
- And you want to pay the debt.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.476
So where
is this Patty woman now?

18:49.519 --> 18:51.391
- She left while we were
waiting on you to get here.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.914
There was no reason
to hold her.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.611
- OK.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.048
Captain Benson, SVU.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.311
This is Sergeant Tutuola.

18:58.354 --> 18:59.877
- How can I help you?

18:59.921 --> 19:02.619
- Was this woman here tonight?

19:02.663 --> 19:04.404
- Yeah. She left
about 20 minutes ago.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.145
- Yeah. What did she want?

19:06.188 --> 19:07.972
- Unfortunately,
I can't give you information

19:08.016 --> 19:09.322
on visitors or residents.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.324
- You have a supervisor
on site we could talk to?

19:11.367 --> 19:14.196
- He's home, asleep.
Why? What's this about?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.372
- We are investigating a rape.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.679
- Which tends to keep
our ADA up at night.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.855
- So unless you want
to find out

19:20.898 --> 19:22.291
what he does when he's cranky,

19:22.335 --> 19:26.426
I highly suggest you tell us
which room she visited.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.213
- I'm nervous, man.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.302
- About what?

19:33.346 --> 19:37.219
- I mean, Sergeant Tutuola's
boss lady show up.

19:37.263 --> 19:40.353
I-I did pull a gun on him.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.833
You sure he ain't in there
ratting me out?

19:42.877 --> 19:45.488
- One thing at a time.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.577
- My mind defaults
to the catastrophic

19:47.621 --> 19:50.711
after being inside of it
for so long.

19:50.754 --> 19:55.716
- Well, I will say this.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.762
What it takes to survive
in your own head,

19:58.806 --> 20:00.373
being locked away in jail,

20:00.416 --> 20:03.289
is damn good training
for what we're doing tonight.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.726
So just stay focused.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.336
You got this.

20:09.599 --> 20:13.168
- So you did have
a visitor today?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.910
- Yeah. I-I told you.
Older lady.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.129
- What did she want?

20:18.173 --> 20:20.393
- She was an alcoholic.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.829
She was looking for a sponsor.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.134
- In this room?

20:23.178 --> 20:26.137
This is a male-only facility.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.574
- I told her it was pretty odd.

20:27.617 --> 20:30.272
- Yeah.
You know what else is odd?

20:30.316 --> 20:32.883
This bed. It's empty.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.624
You have a roommate?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.587
- Is that him?
- How the hell would I know?

20:40.630 --> 20:42.937
Hey! NYPD!

20:42.980 --> 20:47.115
[car horn honking]

20:47.158 --> 20:49.596
[tires screeching]

20:58.474 --> 20:58.866
.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.563
- Dutch,
what are you doing here?

21:00.607 --> 21:01.434
I told you to stay in the car.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.783
- What happened?
Where's Bruno?

21:02.826 --> 21:04.132
- Dutch, are you OK?

21:05.916 --> 21:08.223
- He got away.
- What? Are you serious?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.094
- Wait.
Who is he talking about?

21:10.138 --> 21:11.661
- The guy
the CO's wife came to see?

21:11.705 --> 21:13.097
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.404
- I-I think it was him.
The guy who raped me.

21:15.448 --> 21:16.753
And you let him go?

21:16.797 --> 21:19.103
- This is Captain Benson, SVU.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.409
Suspect fleeing.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.933
- 5'11", male, white.
Got into a black Nissan.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.631
- OK. Black Nissan.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.634
Near the corner
of Amboy Road and Berry.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.549
- Why didn't you shoot him?

21:29.592 --> 21:32.682
- Because even though I'm rich,
I like my pension.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.175
- [hyperventilating]

21:47.218 --> 21:48.437
- Hey.

21:48.481 --> 21:51.527
Take it easy, Dutch.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.224
Take in a deep breath.

21:56.706 --> 21:59.230
- We're gonna find him, man.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.015
We'll find him.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.678
You want to talk about it?

22:11.721 --> 22:13.593
- What?

22:13.636 --> 22:15.899
- Disassociation.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.296
- Sometimes
I'm back in my cell.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.994
- That happens.
It's normal.

22:25.909 --> 22:29.043
- What if it was him
and he got away for good?

22:29.086 --> 22:30.523
I thought you said
you trust this guy.

22:30.566 --> 22:31.785
- What I don't trust is

22:31.828 --> 22:33.874
people that are careless
with their bullets.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.659
You want to kill the guy
that hurt you?

22:36.703 --> 22:38.357
Is that justice to you?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.836
- He stole my life.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.185
- You're hurt, Dutch.
I get it.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.927
- I just want
to make it all go away.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.668
- Even if it means
going back to prison?

22:45.712 --> 22:47.714
- Even if it kills me.

22:55.286 --> 22:59.421
- How about we find you
something to live for instead?

22:59.465 --> 23:00.770
Tell me about your daughter.

23:02.903 --> 23:05.471
- My daughter?

23:05.514 --> 23:06.820
You remembered I had one?

23:06.863 --> 23:10.040
- I did a background.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.390
- I met her mom
at the Limelight.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.130
And she was knocked up

23:13.174 --> 23:15.437
six months before you and
your old partner arrested me.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.570
- She ever come visit you
with your daughter?

23:17.613 --> 23:19.833
- Hell no.
I already told you,

23:19.876 --> 23:22.705
I didn't want anyone
to see me like that.

23:22.749 --> 23:25.447
Not what they made me become.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.406
The long hair and the makeup.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.016
- I get it.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.409
- Found something.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.672
- You--you got him?
- No. Relax.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.325
I got a name.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.937
Virgil Hatton.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.852
- I just always
called him Cream Cheese.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.244
It's not like
he ever introduced himself.

23:40.288 --> 23:43.465
- Well, at least
we're past the bagel phase

23:43.509 --> 23:45.467
of this investigation.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.817
- It's a start.

23:59.916 --> 24:03.572
- I-I think that's him.

24:03.616 --> 24:04.747
- You think?

24:04.791 --> 24:06.662
"Think" is not good enough, OK?

24:06.706 --> 24:09.317
Let me tell you how this goes.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.146
You go through these photos.
You pick out Cream Cheese.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.801
I call the ADA,
and I get an arrest warrant.

24:16.106 --> 24:18.195
- These are old and dusty.

24:18.239 --> 24:21.895
- These are mug shots from the
year you were allegedly raped.

24:23.549 --> 24:26.465
- [breathing shakily]

24:33.254 --> 24:34.473
- OK.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.782
Oh, yeah. That's him.
That's--that's him.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.001
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.482
Yeah.
Yeah, that--that's him.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.874
- You sure?

24:46.876 --> 24:49.139
- No, I mean,
his neck was thicker.

24:49.183 --> 24:52.491
- Come on. Do you even remember
an eye color or anything?

24:52.534 --> 24:53.666
- Why is that important?

24:53.709 --> 24:55.929
- It's all important, man.
Everything.

24:55.972 --> 24:59.323
We're trying to put someone
behind bars for a lot of years.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.238
You already know
what that's like.

25:01.282 --> 25:05.373
You have to be 100% sure,
or this goes nowhere.

25:09.377 --> 25:12.511
You don't even know if Bruno
was chasing the right guy.

25:15.775 --> 25:17.472
This is bad.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.476
- Let me stare at them longer.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.531
- So you regret
coming downtown?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.968
- Me? Nah.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.447
I got nothing better to do.

25:38.145 --> 25:40.974
- You're not fooling anybody.
I see your armor.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.105
- It's called humor, Fin.

25:42.149 --> 25:45.021
- See,
I had a partner years ago,

25:45.065 --> 25:47.502
an old homicide detective.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.549
He had the same exact
defense mechanism.

25:50.592 --> 25:53.160
- Is he still around?
- No, he retired.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.031
I guess he just ran out of gas.

25:55.075 --> 25:58.339
Last I heard,
he moved back to Baltimore.

25:58.382 --> 26:01.690
Met a divorced female rabbi.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.170
- A rabbi?
- Yeah.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.955
And he bought back
his old cop bar.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.568
It's about 1:30 a.m.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.222
He's probably cracking a joke
to some barfly.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.050
That skinny bastard
had a punchline

26:14.094 --> 26:16.226
for every second of the day.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.228
- It sounds like you miss him.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.013
- I'm not into nostalgia.

26:20.056 --> 26:22.232
I mean, that stuff's heavy.
Brings you down.

26:22.276 --> 26:25.235
- Well, I'm flattered
by the comparison.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.629
And anyway,
the coffee's better here

26:27.673 --> 26:29.805
than what the DOJ
was making up in The Bronx.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.111
- That's all Benson.

26:31.154 --> 26:34.854
She's into that hazelnut stuff.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.160
- Not going so good in there?

26:37.204 --> 26:39.859
- It's been 20 years,

26:39.902 --> 26:42.949
and he didn't get a good look
at the guy's face.

26:42.992 --> 26:45.038
- Virgil Hatton's
got to be our perp.

26:45.081 --> 26:50.043
Why else would the old CO send
his wife to go warn the guy?

26:50.086 --> 26:51.740
- Let me call Carisi.

26:51.784 --> 26:55.483
See if he can find a way
we can bring Ryan in.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.532
- "Captain Crunk"?

27:01.576 --> 27:03.056
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.101
- That's your nickname
on "Prison Chat."

27:05.145 --> 27:06.668
You want to tell us
how you got that?

27:06.712 --> 27:08.888
- Don't you NYPD cops
have better sources

27:08.931 --> 27:10.280
than a web forum?

27:10.324 --> 27:12.152
- My client's been
a dedicated member of the DOC

27:12.195 --> 27:13.936
for the past 25 years.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.504
He's bound to have ruffled
a few feathers along the way.

27:16.547 --> 27:20.203
- Hmm. Well, this is more
than ruffled feathers.

27:20.247 --> 27:21.944
We contacted your fellow COs.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.250
They gave us some statements

27:23.293 --> 27:26.122
that, uh, before
you were promoted to captain,

27:26.166 --> 27:27.558
say you used to bend the rules.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.648
- Smuggling drugs,
allowing rapes.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.998
- Whoa, whoa. I told you,
I never raped anybody.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.217
- Nah. You're just
a pimp with a badge.

27:34.261 --> 27:36.480
And the minute you opened
Ivan Hernandez's cell

27:36.524 --> 27:38.569
for Virgil Hatton,
that made you criminally liable

27:38.613 --> 27:39.745
for his actions.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.355
- Who?

27:41.398 --> 27:42.704
I never heard
of either of these people.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.315
- So how is it
right after we left your house,

27:45.359 --> 27:47.535
your wife happened
to show up at Horizon House?

27:47.578 --> 27:51.147
Clerk said she asked for Hatton
by name specifically.

27:51.191 --> 27:53.410
- He must be mistaken.
[door opens]

27:58.111 --> 28:00.200
- You know what that is,
don't you?

28:00.243 --> 28:02.071
- What's that?
- Proof your client

28:02.115 --> 28:06.162
knows Virgil Hatton
outside of the Tombs.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.861
New Dorp High School.
Class of '79.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.384
- You two look pretty cozy.

28:10.427 --> 28:13.517
- Neighbors and best friends
all through high school.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.390
He's your boy.
You grew up together.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.740
- I, uh, need a moment
with my client.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.263
- Yeah,
take all the time you need.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.439
But you're gonna do time
for this, Ryan.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.834
Now, you can cooperate with us.

28:25.878 --> 28:29.316
And maybe I can talk to the DA.
He'll cut you a deal.

28:36.018 --> 28:39.282
- [sighs]
Look, the Tombs was a zoo.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.676
You do whatever you can
to maintain order.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.373
You look
for the biggest guy in there,

28:43.417 --> 28:45.811
and they help you
keep things in check.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.290
When big, old Virgil showed up,

28:47.334 --> 28:49.292
you bet your ass
my job got a whole lot easier.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.904
- And in exchange,
you sanction prison rape.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.210
You gave him access
to other inmates to brutalize.

28:54.254 --> 28:55.385
- How many times
did you do this?

28:55.429 --> 28:56.604
- Don't answer that.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.911
- Virgil's always
been a scary guy.

28:58.954 --> 29:02.044
I mean, they called him
the Hangman for a reason.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.786
- That H on Dutch's chest.

29:06.353 --> 29:07.876
- What do you want?

29:07.920 --> 29:09.095
- I want your boy Hatton.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.574
- And then my client
gets a deal?

29:10.618 --> 29:12.402
- Well, that depends.
I'm not in the habit

29:12.446 --> 29:14.753
of exchanging something
for nothing.

29:16.363 --> 29:19.235
- He's been ducking my calls.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.455
But there's a bar
on the Lower East Side.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.500
He likes to hide out there.

29:35.295 --> 29:35.686
.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.732
- Can we trust this CO?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.603
- Pete Ryan is
a grade-A scumbag

29:39.647 --> 29:41.127
with more self-interest
than most.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.868
- Counselor,
do we have enough

29:42.911 --> 29:44.347
for an arrest warrant
for Hatton?

29:44.391 --> 29:47.611
- I'd feel better
if we had an admissible ID.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.222
- Dutch said he thought
he recognized him

29:49.265 --> 29:50.571
outside the sober house.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.790
- Yeah, after midnight,
when the guy's running

29:51.833 --> 29:53.182
full speed away from him.

29:53.226 --> 29:54.401
He couldn't even
pick out his mugshot.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.185
- But I saw it.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.884
Look, Dutch had
a classic somatic reaction

29:58.927 --> 30:00.233
to this guy Hatton.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.322
OK, you know
with this kind of trauma,

30:02.365 --> 30:04.150
sometimes your body remembers

30:04.193 --> 30:05.760
what your brain
wants to forget.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.718
- Yeah, that's right, Liv.
You know that, and I know that.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.590
But a jury is not
gonna see him twitch

30:09.633 --> 30:10.721
and then say,
"We gotta convict."

30:10.765 --> 30:12.332
- So we just scoop up Hatton

30:12.375 --> 30:14.421
and have Dutch ID him
in an old-school lineup.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.726
- Fin, listen.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.946
I cannot arrest
without probable cause.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.775
And I don't have probable cause
until I get a positive ID.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.387
- Ryan gave up the bar
where Hatton is.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.172
Let's call the fire marshal,

30:26.215 --> 30:29.262
wake him up if you have to, and
have him close the place down.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.786
- We stash Dutch
in a unmarked van out front.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.267
He might be able
to pick him out of a crowd.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.703
- I'm game.

30:36.878 --> 30:39.272
- Counselor?

30:39.315 --> 30:40.882
- Yeah, it'll be
just like old times.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.492
Except I'm unarmed.

30:42.536 --> 30:43.798
- Doesn't matter.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.018
You'll be staying
in the van with Dutch.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.636
- I'm nervous,
and I can't breathe.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.464
- Don't die on me now, dude.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.031
You gotta take this guy down.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.554
- Do we even know he's there?

31:00.597 --> 31:03.339
- UCs are canvassing the bar.
They'll let us know.

31:05.994 --> 31:08.649
- You should have kids.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.825
You'd make a good dad.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.132
- I've got a son
and a grandson.

31:13.175 --> 31:16.962
I wasn't always
the best father or husband.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.921
- At least you got to be one.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.358
Bet you're
a better dad now too.

31:24.317 --> 31:28.016
- Yeah.
Ken and I get along fine.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.497
And I love my grandson.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.847
He's a cute kid.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.243
- I didn't have a good family.

31:37.286 --> 31:41.551
- It's never too late
to change.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.162
- You ever hear of Dutch tears?

31:43.205 --> 31:45.773
- No.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.167
- They're these things
created by, um,

31:48.210 --> 31:51.344
pouring molten glass
into cold water.

31:51.387 --> 31:55.391
Little droplets
with a long glass tail.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.002
It looks like sperm, but...

31:57.045 --> 31:58.699
it's one of the hardest things
on Earth.

31:58.742 --> 31:59.830
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.876
They can withstand a hit
from a hammer.

32:01.920 --> 32:06.185
You shoot one of these things,
and even the bullet shatters.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.535
But you so much as flick
that long sperm tail

32:08.578 --> 32:11.233
with one of your fingers,

32:11.277 --> 32:16.195
and it explodes like a brick
through stained glass window.

32:16.238 --> 32:19.633
There ain't
no putting it back together.

32:19.676 --> 32:23.071
- Why do I feel that we're not
talking about glass anymore?

32:26.422 --> 32:27.989
Your family?

32:28.033 --> 32:29.512
- I'm talking about me.

32:35.518 --> 32:36.911
- Well, look, man.

32:36.955 --> 32:40.915
We all have armor up front.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.962
And I know it's heavy.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.486
But I believe
that after tonight,

32:46.529 --> 32:50.055
you'll be able
to lose some of yours.

32:50.098 --> 32:54.798
After you ID this guy Hatton.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.844
It's time.

33:02.545 --> 33:03.851
[door slides open]

33:03.894 --> 33:06.027
Where are we with this?
- Fire marshal's late.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.160
- Should have
been here already.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.944
How you holding up, Dutch?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.860
- He's hanging tough.
Up front, at least.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.383
- There's the marshal.

33:14.427 --> 33:17.604
[sirens wailing]

33:17.647 --> 33:20.302
- Let me find out
how long this is gonna take.

33:24.959 --> 33:28.049
[radio chatter]

33:29.659 --> 33:31.139
- So we know your guy's inside?

33:31.183 --> 33:32.619
- Plainclothes confirm.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.925
How long is it gonna take you
to clear that place out?

33:34.969 --> 33:36.971
- We'll tell them
we got a gas leak complaint.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.625
You'd be surprised
how fast people tend

33:38.668 --> 33:40.583
to vacate a building when you
tell them it's about to blow.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.237
- OK. My vic's in that van.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.196
So it might take a minute
for him to ID.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.068
- Take as long as you need.
- Thanks.

33:49.679 --> 33:52.117
They'll have the place cleared
in a few minutes.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.814
You stay in the van.
And don't worry.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.076
Nobody even knows
you're in here.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.383
- Take your time.
Look every guy in the eye.

33:57.426 --> 33:58.819
You've gotta be
dead sure on this.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.082
You got it?
- And then what?

34:01.126 --> 34:02.823
- He'll find himself
in a nice, orange jumpsuit.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.564
- Full circle.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.263
- All right.
Here we go.

34:12.266 --> 34:14.226
Look at every one of them.

34:14.268 --> 34:17.054
- Yeah, let me know
when you recognize him.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.621
- It's not him.
