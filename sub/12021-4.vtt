09:44.900 --> 09:46.534
THE ROAD.

09:46.602 --> 09:47.802
WHILE THE BETTLES CREW TRIES

09:47.837 --> 09:49.704
NOT TO GO THROUGH IT.

09:49.772 --> 09:51.239
>> WHOA, WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

09:52.875 --> 09:54.075
>> narrator: IN THE BLIZZARD

09:54.110 --> 09:56.244
THAT SWALLOWED PRUDHOE BAY...

09:58.981 --> 10:00.715
RAY VELLIEUX AND TIM BISHOP ARE

10:00.750 --> 10:02.817
BATTLING FREEZING WINDS AND

10:02.885 --> 10:07.422
BLOWING SNOW...

10:07.456 --> 10:10.625
TO LOCK DOWN RAY'S BACK HAUL.

10:18.267 --> 10:22.704
>> [puffing]

10:22.738 --> 10:24.339
>> narrator: AN HOUR INTO THE

10:24.373 --> 10:25.774
JOB, THE BRUTAL ARCTIC

10:25.808 --> 10:27.709
CONDITIONS HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE

10:27.743 --> 10:29.511
THEIR TOLL.

10:29.545 --> 10:33.348
>> OHH.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.883
UHH.

10:47.663 --> 10:48.430
>> OHH.

10:48.497 --> 10:50.131
>> narrator: FINALLY, THE DECK

10:50.166 --> 10:51.333
IS SECURED.

10:55.104 --> 10:56.304
BUT WITH THE BLIZZARD

10:56.339 --> 10:58.440
BUILDING, RAY MAY BE STUCK IN

10:58.474 --> 11:01.242
PRUDHOE FOR SOME TIME.

11:09.452 --> 11:11.353
200 MILES SOUTH...

11:11.387 --> 11:13.488
>> WELCOME TO THE TWILIGHT ZONE

11:13.522 --> 11:14.689
AGAIN.

11:14.724 --> 11:15.857
>> narrator: ALEX HAS SPENT THE

11:15.891 --> 11:17.425
LAST TWO HOURS BATTLING THE

11:17.493 --> 11:21.696
STORM.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.333
>> ROAD'S STARTING TO CLOSE UP.

11:25.368 --> 11:26.534
THEN THE DRIFTS STARTED GETTING

11:26.602 --> 11:29.237
DEEPER.

11:29.305 --> 11:30.438
AND THE NEXT STEP IS BEING

11:30.506 --> 11:32.307
BURIED.

11:46.222 --> 11:47.255
>> narrator: JUST AS THE ROAD IS

11:47.323 --> 11:50.325
ABOUT TO VANISH...

11:50.359 --> 11:52.427
ALEX SPOTS A GRATER WORKING UP

11:52.461 --> 11:53.795
AHEAD.

12:01.604 --> 12:02.704
>> I'VE JUST COME INTO AN AREA

12:02.772 --> 12:04.606
WHERE THE GRATER IS BUSY MAKING

12:04.673 --> 12:06.207
A PASS, SO IT'S A LITTLE EASIER

12:06.242 --> 12:07.475
TO SEE THE ROAD NOW.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.043
>> narrator: THE GRATER IS A

12:09.111 --> 12:10.311
SURE SIGN THAT HE'S APPROACHING

12:10.346 --> 12:12.147
COLDFOOT.

12:12.181 --> 12:13.214
>> WELL, THIS IS A BLESSING.

12:13.249 --> 12:16.251
SEE, NOW WE GOT A ROAD TO WATCH.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.886
>> narrator: AND TO ALEX, A SIGN

12:17.953 --> 12:19.521
THAT SOMEONE EVEN HIGHER THAN

12:19.555 --> 12:21.322
THE D.O.T. IS LOOKING OUT FOR

12:21.390 --> 12:22.590
HIM.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.692
>> MY FAITH HELPS ME THROUGH

12:24.760 --> 12:26.861
WHATEVER CHALLENGES I HAVE TO

12:28.731 --> 12:31.132
I THANK GOD FOR, UH, HIS

12:31.167 --> 12:34.402
BLESSINGS AND HELP.

12:38.107 --> 12:39.841

12:39.875 --> 12:42.243
THE CLEAR SKIES OF FAIRBANKS,

12:42.278 --> 12:44.112
HUGH ROWLAND IS READY FOR HIS

12:44.146 --> 12:45.580
NEXT LOAD.

12:45.648 --> 12:47.849
>> OH, HEY, HUGH, GOOD MORNING.

12:47.883 --> 12:49.050
READY TO HEAD UP NORTH, ANOTHER

12:49.084 --> 12:49.951

12:51.387 --> 12:52.520
>> WEATHER UP THERE'S PRETTY

12:52.588 --> 12:53.788
BAD.

12:53.856 --> 12:54.956
>> narrator: NASTY WEATHER IS

12:55.024 --> 12:56.057
NOTHING NEW FOR THE VETERAN

12:56.125 --> 12:57.492
POLAR BEAR.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.127
BUT TO CARLILE, HUGH IS JUST

12:59.161 --> 13:01.563
ANOTHER SECOND-YEAR ROOKIE.

13:01.597 --> 13:02.664
>> THIS MORNING, WE'RE GONNA

13:02.698 --> 13:04.599
HAVE YOU FOLLOW JACK JESSEE UP,

13:04.667 --> 13:07.602

13:07.636 --> 13:09.604
WE'RE JUST PAIRING GUYS UP FOR,

13:09.672 --> 13:12.106
YOU KNOW, JUST MORE SAFETY.

13:12.141 --> 13:13.508
>> HEY, I SHOULD LEARN HOW TO

13:13.576 --> 13:14.576
DRIVE IF HE'S IN FRONT OF ME,

13:14.643 --> 13:17.512
HUH?

13:17.546 --> 13:19.380
>> OH, YEAH.

13:19.415 --> 13:20.482
YOU'RE GONNA RUN THAT UP.

13:20.516 --> 13:22.283
JUST FOLLOW HIM UP THERE.

13:22.318 --> 13:23.551
ALL RIGHT?

13:23.586 --> 13:26.120
>> CHECK.

13:26.188 --> 13:27.288
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO TRAVEL

13:27.323 --> 13:28.923
ALONE WHEN THERE'S A STORM ON.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.325
AND SO THEN THEY PUT ME IN WITH

13:30.392 --> 13:32.126
A GUY NAMED JACK JESSEE THERE,

13:32.194 --> 13:33.194
'CAUSE I GUESS HE'S THE KING OF

13:33.229 --> 13:34.863
THE DALTON.

13:34.897 --> 13:35.864
>> narrator: AS HE WAITS FOR

13:35.931 --> 13:37.599
JACK, THE POLAR BEAR CHAFES AT

13:37.666 --> 13:42.470
THE IDEA HE NEEDS A BABYSITTER.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.038
>> SO NOW I'M SUCKIN' HIND TIT

13:48.477 --> 13:49.777
POSSIBLE.

14:05.794 --> 14:07.295
COME ON.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.501
DAMN IT.

14:19.241 --> 14:20.408
I BEEN WAITING FOR KING JAMES

14:20.442 --> 14:22.210
THERE FOR THREE HOURS ALREADY

14:22.244 --> 14:23.845
THIS MORNING.

14:23.879 --> 14:25.113
I KNOW THEY WANT US TO TRAVEL

14:25.180 --> 14:27.382
TOGETHER, BUT IT'S ALREADY NOON.

14:27.416 --> 14:28.550
>> narrator: THE COMPANY MAY

14:28.584 --> 14:30.218
WANT HIM TO RUN WITH JACK, BUT

14:30.286 --> 14:31.920
THE POLAR BEAR DIDN'T MAKE IT TO

14:31.954 --> 14:33.655
THE TOP PLAYING BY SOMEONE

14:33.689 --> 14:36.558
ELSE'S RULES.

14:36.592 --> 14:39.127
>> KING JESSEE, UH, I'LL MEET UP

14:39.161 --> 14:40.562
WITH HIM AT COLDFOOT.

14:40.629 --> 14:41.930
I JUST WANTED TO GET GOING.

14:41.997 --> 14:43.131
I MEAN, I GOTTA MAKE SOME MONEY

14:43.165 --> 14:44.666
HERE.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.172
THEY CAN THINK WHATEVER THEY

14:51.206 --> 14:52.674
WANT ABOUT ME.

14:52.708 --> 14:53.841
MOST OF 'EM ALWAYS THINK I'M AN

14:53.876 --> 14:56.911
[bleep].

14:56.946 --> 14:58.212
THEY CAN SHOVE IT.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.484
>> narrator: 60 MINUTES LATER,

15:03.519 --> 15:06.754
JACK IS FINALLY READY TO ROLL.

15:06.789 --> 15:07.922
>> SO WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT

15:07.990 --> 15:08.923
LATER START THAN I REALLY WOULD

15:08.958 --> 15:09.757
HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.025
BUT THAT'S OKAY, BECAUSE THERE'S

15:11.093 --> 15:12.193
A BIG STORM UP THERE RIGHT NOW,

15:12.261 --> 15:13.294
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE IT DIES

15:13.362 --> 15:14.929
OUT AND MOVES THROUGH.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.130
AND THAT WAY, I CAN DRIVE

15:16.198 --> 15:16.898
STRAIGHT IN.

15:16.932 --> 15:18.466
>> narrator: BUT WITH THE STORM

15:18.500 --> 15:22.303
RAGING AT ATIGUN PASS...

15:22.371 --> 15:24.572
JACK'S IN NO HURRY TO DRIVE INTO

15:24.607 --> 15:26.274
THE HEART OF IT.

15:30.779 --> 15:33.014
>> WELL, WE'VE GOT A VAC TRUCK.

15:33.015 --> 15:33.915
THEY REALLY NEED IT UP HERE

15:33.949 --> 15:35.750
TONIGHT, SO THEY CAN GET THIS

15:35.784 --> 15:37.218
THING FIRED UP.

15:37.286 --> 15:40.088
THEY USE THESE VAC TRUCKS TO FOR

15:40.122 --> 15:43.124
POTABLE WATER.

15:43.158 --> 15:44.392
THESE EXPLORATORY MAN CAMPS

15:44.460 --> 15:46.461
THEY'VE GOT OUT SEARCHING FOR

15:46.528 --> 15:48.563
MORE OIL RELY ON THE TRUCKS LIKE

15:48.597 --> 15:50.398
THIS TO DRIVE OUT TO 'EM...

15:50.466 --> 15:51.666
AND--AND FILL UP THEIR HOLDING

15:51.700 --> 15:53.935
TANKS.

15:54.003 --> 15:56.004
THE AREA UP HERE IS SO ARID,

15:56.038 --> 15:58.840
IT'S JUST LIKE A DESERT.

15:58.907 --> 16:00.842
YOU CAN DEHYDRATE HERE JUST AS

16:00.909 --> 16:02.110
FAST OR FASTER THAN YOU CAN OUT

16:02.144 --> 16:05.580
IN THE SAHARA DESERT.

16:05.648 --> 16:06.848
MOST PEOPLE THINK THE BIGGEST

16:06.882 --> 16:08.483
DANGER UP HERE IS FREEZING TO

16:08.550 --> 16:11.819
DEATH.

16:11.854 --> 16:13.755
BUT THE SECOND MOST DANGEROUS

16:13.822 --> 16:16.557
THING IS DEHYDRATION.

16:18.661 --> 16:19.827
>> narrator: THE COMPANY IS

16:19.862 --> 16:21.462
COUNTING ON HIM, AND THE HAUL

16:21.497 --> 16:23.631
ROAD ACE HAS NO INTENTION OF

16:23.666 --> 16:25.299
LETTING THEM DOWN.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.534
>> I'M GETTING THIS TANK THERE

16:26.568 --> 16:28.369
TONIGHT, STORM OR NO STORM.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.072
[horn honks]

16:31.106 --> 16:33.174
>> narrator: 170 MILES NORTHWEST

16:33.208 --> 16:35.176
OF FAIRBANKS IS THE ISOLATED

16:35.210 --> 16:37.378
TOWN OF BETTLES, ALASKA.

16:37.446 --> 16:39.247
THE ONLY LIFELINE TO THIS TOWN

16:39.281 --> 16:41.716
OF 60 PEOPLE IS THE FLEET OF BIG

16:41.750 --> 16:43.451
RIGS OWNED AND OPERATED BY MERV

16:43.485 --> 16:45.186
GILBERTSON.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.721
>> I'VE GOT 12 LOADS TO GET OVER

16:46.755 --> 16:48.956
THAT TRAIL IN LESS THAN 30 DAYS.

16:48.957 --> 16:49.924
IF I DON'T GET THAT DONE,

16:49.992 --> 16:52.593
THEY DON'T GET THEIR FUEL.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.561
>> narrator: FOR JUST A FEW

16:53.629 --> 16:55.797
WEEKS EACH YEAR, THE JIM RIVER

16:55.831 --> 16:57.632
FREEZES, CREATING A BRIDGE FOR

16:57.700 --> 16:59.167
MERV'S TRUCKS TO SUPPLY THE

16:59.201 --> 17:02.370
TOWN...BUT CONDITIONS ON THE

17:02.404 --> 17:05.707
RIVER CHANGE HOUR BY HOUR.

17:05.741 --> 17:07.275
>> WOW.

17:07.309 --> 17:08.476
MAN, IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD, IS

17:08.510 --> 17:10.912
IT?

17:10.946 --> 17:12.914
>> narrator: SO EACH TRIP BEFORE

17:12.948 --> 17:15.349
MERV'S BIG RIGS CAN ROLL, HE'S

17:15.384 --> 17:17.552
GOT TO TEST THE ICE.

17:17.619 --> 17:18.653
>> BUT I DON'T HEAR ANY

17:18.687 --> 17:20.088
CRACKING, SO THAT'S--THAT'S

17:20.155 --> 17:21.823
COMFORTING.

17:26.495 --> 17:29.330
YEAH, WHAT A MESS.

17:29.364 --> 17:30.898
>> IT LOOKS DOABLE.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.734
I THINK WE CAN, UH, I THINK WE

17:32.768 --> 17:34.368
CAN MAKE IT ACROSS.

17:34.403 --> 17:35.603
>> WELL...AS YOU COME DOWN RIGHT

17:35.637 --> 17:37.538
THERE, YOU'RE DEFINITELY GONNA

17:37.573 --> 17:38.906
FALL THROUGH.

17:38.941 --> 17:39.807
>> narrator: MERV HAS HIS

17:39.842 --> 17:40.541
DOUBTS.

17:40.609 --> 17:42.443
>> I THINK WE'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.644
>> narrator: BUT JAMIE ELLINGSON

17:43.679 --> 17:45.279
FROM THE D.O.T. THINKS IT'S

17:45.347 --> 17:48.082
WORTH A TEST RUN IN HIS 3 1/2

17:48.117 --> 17:49.550
TON PICKUP.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.827
>> WHOA, WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

17:59.862 --> 18:02.830
OH, DAMN!

18:02.865 --> 18:04.465
>> narrator: THE ICE BEGINS TO

18:04.500 --> 18:06.968
CRUMBLE AROUND THE PICKUP.

18:11.907 --> 18:13.875
>> WHOA.

18:13.909 --> 18:16.778
[tires grinding]

18:16.812 --> 18:18.980
[ice cracking]

18:19.014 --> 18:20.148
>> narrator: JAMIE MAKES A QUICK

18:20.182 --> 18:21.983
MOVE AND BACKS UP ONTO MORE

18:22.017 --> 18:28.523
SOLID ICE.

18:28.557 --> 18:30.525
MERV'S PLAN TO REACH BETTLES

18:30.559 --> 18:33.161
TODAY IS JUST AS SHAKY AS THE

18:33.195 --> 18:34.896
FROZEN RIVER CROSSING.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.898
>> PUT A LOADED TRUCK ON THIS...

18:36.965 --> 18:39.433
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

18:39.468 --> 18:41.169
THE LAST TIME WE ENCOUNTERED

18:41.236 --> 18:42.170
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WE DID

18:42.204 --> 18:45.339
ABOUT $10,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.541
>> narrator: BUT JAMIE'S NOT

18:46.575 --> 18:52.680
READY TO GIVE UP.

18:52.714 --> 18:57.351
>> OKAY.

18:57.419 --> 19:00.721
[laughing] SUCCESS!

19:00.789 --> 19:01.956
>> narrator: THE GOOD NEWS:

19:01.990 --> 19:04.892
JAMIE'S SUPER DUTY FORD AND HIS

19:04.927 --> 19:06.994
PRIDE MADE IT ACROSS THE THIN

19:07.029 --> 19:08.529
ICE UNHARMED.

19:08.597 --> 19:10.731
THE BAD NEWS: THERE'S NO WAY

19:10.799 --> 19:13.367
MERV IS GONNA RISK HIS 50,000

19:13.435 --> 19:15.703
POUND BIG RIGS TO GET ACROSS.

19:15.771 --> 19:16.604
>> WELL, I FEEL BAD FOR THE

19:16.638 --> 19:17.638
RESIDENTS BECAUSE IT'S GONNA

19:17.706 --> 19:19.040
TAKE A WHILE BEFORE THIS FREEZES

19:19.074 --> 19:20.174
SOLID AGAIN.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.676
THEY WANT YOU TO COME ACROSS,

19:21.710 --> 19:22.877
BUT THEY KNOW THE STORY.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.779
IF--IF YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T.

19:24.813 --> 19:27.949
AND RIGHT NOW...YOU CAN'T.

19:27.983 --> 19:31.719
[laughs]

19:31.787 --> 19:32.854
>> narrator: BACK IN

19:32.888 --> 19:33.955
FAIRBANKS...

19:33.989 --> 19:35.356
>> MORNIN', BOSS.

19:35.390 --> 19:36.591
>> GREG, HOW WE DOING?

19:36.625 --> 19:37.592
>> narrator: GREG IS READY TO

19:37.626 --> 19:38.893
HEAD NORTH.

19:38.961 --> 19:39.794
>> AND THE PASS IS SUPPOSED TO

19:39.828 --> 19:41.062
HIT 30 TO 40 MILES AN HOUR

19:41.096 --> 19:41.996
TONIGHT.

19:42.064 --> 19:43.331
SO WE GOT A LOT OF GUYS SITTING

>> WHY, IS THERE A PROBLEM UP

28:53.998 --> 28:55.199
THERE?

29:08.480 --> 29:10.013
>> YEAH, I'M ABOUT 100 YARDS, I

29:10.048 --> 29:11.815
THINK, BEHIND JOHN, AND I CAN'T

29:11.850 --> 29:14.184
EVEN SEE HIM.

29:24.062 --> 29:25.262
HOLY MACKEREL.

29:27.415 --> 29:31.952
[whirring and grinding]

29:31.986 --> 29:32.953
>> narrator: FOR THE LAST 24

29:33.021 --> 29:36.290
HOURS, A PHASE THREE STORM HAS

29:36.324 --> 29:38.492
HAMMERED ATIGUN PASS, BRINGING

29:38.526 --> 29:42.062
TRAFFIC TO A HALT AND

29:42.096 --> 29:44.331
THREATENING TO DESTROY ANYONE

29:44.399 --> 29:47.334
WHO ENTERS.

29:47.402 --> 29:49.703
BUT NOW, WORD HAS COME IN THAT A

29:49.771 --> 29:51.038
FEW TRUCKS ARE HEADED OUT TO

29:51.072 --> 29:55.242
TAKE ON THE PASS.

29:55.310 --> 29:57.778
>> I'M GETTIN' READY TO GO.

29:57.812 --> 29:58.846
>> narrator: ANXIOUS TO PROVE

29:58.880 --> 30:00.581
SHE CAN DELIVER HER URGENT LOAD

30:00.648 --> 30:03.584
ON TIME, LISA WANTS TO BE IN THE

30:03.618 --> 30:07.955
FIRST GROUP LEAVING COLDFOOT.

30:08.022 --> 30:09.423
>> I AM GONNA BE SITTING IN MY

30:09.491 --> 30:10.491
TRUCK BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL

30:10.558 --> 30:11.425
LIKE THIS.

30:11.459 --> 30:12.392
AND AS SOON AS I SEE SOMEONE

30:12.427 --> 30:13.560
WALK OUT AND GET IN THEIR TRUCK,

30:13.595 --> 30:15.229
I'M GONNA LET THE CLUTCH OUT.

30:15.296 --> 30:16.697
[laughs]

30:16.731 --> 30:19.967
WATCH OUT! I'M COMIN' THROUGH.

30:20.034 --> 30:21.335
[honk honk]

30:21.369 --> 30:22.402
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF

30:22.437 --> 30:26.139
HERE.

30:26.174 --> 30:27.374
>> narrator: AS THE FIRST TRUCKS

30:27.408 --> 30:29.576
LEAVE THE YARD, LISA JUMPS IN

30:29.611 --> 30:36.149
LINE, READY TO RACE NORTH.

30:36.217 --> 30:37.651
>> AND I'M RUNNING WITH A WHOLE

30:37.685 --> 30:39.586
PACK OF PEOPLE, SO I GOT TWO

30:39.654 --> 30:41.121
SCOUTS IN FRONT OF ME.

30:41.189 --> 30:42.589
LONG AS THEY DON'T DITCH ME,

30:42.657 --> 30:43.857
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS STORM OUT

30:43.925 --> 30:45.025
TOGETHER.

30:45.059 --> 30:47.394
YOU DON'T GO TRUCKING IN A STORM

30:47.428 --> 30:49.830
WITHOUT A BUDDY.

30:54.702 --> 30:56.570
I AM SO GLAD TO BE OUT OF

30:56.604 --> 30:57.771
COLDFOOT.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.411
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING A

31:04.479 --> 31:10.417
LITTLE HAIRY UP THERE.

31:10.485 --> 31:11.919
>> narrator: BACK IN COLDFOOT,

31:11.953 --> 31:13.921
WITH TRUCKS BEGINNING TO ROLL

31:13.955 --> 31:16.189
NORTH, THE POLAR BEAR TAKES ONE

31:16.224 --> 31:17.824
MORE SHOT AT BEING A COMPANY

31:17.859 --> 31:21.295
MAN.

31:21.329 --> 31:23.497
>> HEY, YOU, WHAT'S HAPPENING.

31:23.531 --> 31:24.464
>> NOT MUCH. WHAT TIME DID YOU

31:24.499 --> 31:27.234
GET IN LAST NIGHT?

31:27.302 --> 31:28.135
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

31:28.169 --> 31:29.303
>> DON'T REMEMBER.

31:29.337 --> 31:30.404
[laughing]

31:30.438 --> 31:31.204
WHAT TIME YOU PULLING OUT OF

31:31.239 --> 31:32.205

31:32.240 --> 31:33.273
>> UH, WHEN I GET DONE WITH

31:33.308 --> 31:34.641
THIS, I THINK.

31:34.676 --> 31:35.943
WHAT'D YOU HEAR ABOUT THE ROAD?

31:36.010 --> 31:36.944
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING YET.

31:37.011 --> 31:37.911
>> I JUST KIND OF HEARD THAT

31:37.946 --> 31:43.650
IT'S OPEN.

31:43.685 --> 31:45.218
WELL, I'M GONNA GO GET READY TO

31:45.286 --> 31:46.753
GO, AND THEN, UH, WE'LL HEAD UP

31:46.788 --> 31:48.388
TOGETHER IF YOU'RE...

31:48.456 --> 31:49.756
WANT TO, OR WHATEVER.

31:49.791 --> 31:50.924
DOESN'T MATTER.

31:50.959 --> 31:51.959
>> YEAH, SURE, I JUST--REALLY

31:52.026 --> 31:53.026
JUST GOTTA GET DONE HERE, AND

31:53.094 --> 31:54.227
SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO.

31:54.262 --> 31:55.462
>> ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO YOU

31:55.496 --> 31:56.296
AFTER A BIT.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.097
>> OKAY.

31:57.131 --> 31:58.565
WE WILL SEE YOU OUT THERE.

32:14.248 --> 32:15.382
>> I'M JUST KIND OF SITTING

32:15.450 --> 32:16.483
HERE WAITING ON KING JAMES

32:16.551 --> 32:19.119
THERE, AND...

32:19.153 --> 32:20.387
APPARENTLY HE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER

32:20.421 --> 32:22.656
HOUR.

32:22.724 --> 32:23.857
>> I HAD A COUPLE OLD TIMERS ONE

32:23.891 --> 32:25.859
TIME TELL ME, "DO NOT PASS UP A

32:25.893 --> 32:27.427
WARM MEAL ON THIS ROAD."

32:27.462 --> 32:29.296
YOU GET A CHANCE TO STOP AND GET

32:29.330 --> 32:31.131
ONE, GET IT, BECAUSE...YOU NEVER

32:31.165 --> 32:34.034
KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

32:34.068 --> 32:35.102
>> AND I ASKED HIM WHAT TIME HE

32:35.169 --> 32:36.103
WAS LEAVING, AND...

32:36.170 --> 32:38.639
I DON'T KNOW, I, UH...

32:38.673 --> 32:40.207
LIKE I SAID, HE'S PRETTY FULL OF

32:40.241 --> 32:41.575
HIMSELF.

32:47.849 --> 32:48.949
>> WELL, I THINK HE WAS READY TO

32:49.017 --> 32:50.751
GO, BUT...I'M NOT DONE EATING.

32:50.818 --> 32:52.753
SO...I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE ALL

32:52.820 --> 32:53.820
THIS GOOD FOOD JUST SITTING

32:53.855 --> 32:55.756
HERE.

32:55.790 --> 32:56.923
>> narrator: SINCE JACK WON'T

32:56.991 --> 32:58.825
JOIN HIM, HUGH MAKES A PLAN TO

32:58.860 --> 33:00.394
BEAT HIM.

33:00.461 --> 33:02.663
HE'LL DODGE THE STORM AND RACK

33:02.730 --> 33:05.932
UP TWO LOADS TO JACK'S ONE.

33:05.967 --> 33:06.933
>> I GOTTA GO IN AND PHONE

33:06.968 --> 33:08.735
DISPATCH.

33:08.770 --> 33:09.836
SEE IF I CAN DROP MY LOAD HERE

33:09.871 --> 33:12.005
AND...GO GET ANOTHER ONE, SO AT

33:12.073 --> 33:13.373
LEAST I'M NOT BEHIND THE GAME SO

33:13.441 --> 33:14.841
FAR.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.643
HEY, I'M UP AT COLDFOOT HERE.

33:16.678 --> 33:19.112
I GUESS IT'S STORMING UP THERE.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.147
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF I COULD

33:20.214 --> 33:21.348
DROP MY LOAD HERE AND COME BACK

33:21.382 --> 33:22.215
FOR ANOTHER ONE AND STOCKPILE A

33:22.283 --> 33:23.283
COUPLE.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.387
>> OKAY, THANKS.

33:27.455 --> 33:28.755
SO I'LL GRAB ANOTHER ONE AND

33:28.823 --> 33:31.191
BURN 'ER BACK UP HERE.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.292
I'LL GET MY LOAD COUNT UP.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.827
THE END OF MARCH COMES AROUND,

33:33.895 --> 33:34.928
I'M LAID OFF.

33:34.962 --> 33:36.196
SO I'M HERE TO GET AS MANY LOADS

33:36.230 --> 33:37.798
AS I CAN, AND THAT'S THE WHOLE

33:37.832 --> 33:39.533
IDEA FOR ME.

33:39.567 --> 33:40.567
>> narrator: ONCE AGAIN, HUGH

33:40.635 --> 33:41.835
PROVES THAT NOTHING'S GONNA

33:41.903 --> 33:43.904
STAND BETWEEN THE POLAR BEAR AND

33:43.938 --> 33:45.205
HIS PAYCHECK.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.339
>> I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS.

33:46.374 --> 33:47.841
I'M HERE TO MAKE MONEY.

33:47.909 --> 33:50.077
>> [clears throat]

33:50.111 --> 33:51.278
>> narrator: AS HUGH HEADS SOUTH

33:51.345 --> 33:53.647
INTO CLEAR SKIES, LISA HEADS

33:53.681 --> 33:56.116
NORTH INTO THE STORM.

34:00.588 --> 34:05.092
[indistinct radio chatter]

34:05.126 --> 34:07.094
>> IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT IT

34:07.161 --> 34:08.562
WAS GONNA BE OUT HERE.

34:08.596 --> 34:09.830
I MEAN, THERE'S DEFINITELY

34:09.897 --> 34:13.734
PRETTY GOOD SNOW DRIFTS.

34:13.801 --> 34:14.735
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.

34:14.802 --> 34:15.736
THERE'S LIKE A WALL.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.537
YOU CAN SEE RIGHT TO THERE, AND

34:17.572 --> 34:18.839
THEN YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING PAST

34:18.873 --> 34:20.273
THAT.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.291
>> narrator: IT'S NOT LONG

34:38.359 --> 34:40.627
BEFORE LISA AND HER CONVOY ARE

34:40.695 --> 34:42.996
FORCED OFF THE ROAD TO WAIT.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.169
>> UH-OH.

34:49.203 --> 34:52.172
>> OKAY.

34:52.173 --> 34:54.174
>> OKAY.
>> ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD.

34:59.213 --> 35:01.548
WE'RE AT THE EYE OF THE STORM.

35:06.621 --> 35:08.188
THE MOUTH OF THE BEAST.

35:08.256 --> 35:09.456
WE'RE RIGHT THERE.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.363
>> narrator: JUST OVER THE PASS

35:16.430 --> 35:19.966
AND HEADING SOUTH...

35:20.001 --> 35:21.168
>> HE'S GOTTA DRIVE WITH HIS

35:21.202 --> 35:23.436
BACKUP LIGHTS ON, SO IT LOOKS

35:23.471 --> 35:24.604
LIKE HEADLIGHTS COMING AT ME.

35:24.639 --> 35:25.806
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:

35:25.873 --> 35:27.240
TO SEE HIM THROUGH THE DRIFTS.

35:27.275 --> 35:29.242
OH, IS THAT A VEHICLE?

35:29.277 --> 35:30.443
>> narrator: RAY'S EAGERNESS TO

35:30.511 --> 35:32.445
LEAVE PRUDHOE ISN'T LOOKING LIKE

35:32.480 --> 35:33.713
A GOOD DECISION.

35:33.748 --> 35:34.981
>> IT'S HARD TO TELL IF--

35:35.049 --> 35:38.885
IS THAT HIM?

35:38.920 --> 35:42.722
THAT'S HIM.

35:42.790 --> 35:43.890
IT'S HARD TO TELL IF IT WAS

35:43.958 --> 35:45.091
SOMEBODY COMING AT ME OR HIM

35:45.126 --> 35:46.827
DRIVING AWAY FROM ME.

35:46.894 --> 35:50.897
IT'S THE ONLY LIGHTS I CAN SEE.

35:50.932 --> 35:52.098
I'M HAPPY I'M WITH THESE GUYS,

35:52.133 --> 35:53.099
THAT'S FOR SURE.

35:53.167 --> 35:54.334
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE DOING THIS

35:54.368 --> 35:55.068
STUFF ALONE.

35:55.102 --> 35:56.369
NOT RIGHT NOW.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.772
JUST TOO AT IT, YOU KNOW?

36:07.849 --> 36:08.982

36:11.285 --> 36:14.955
CREWS HAVE HEADED FOR SHELTER.

36:14.989 --> 36:19.326
>> DAMN, IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE.

36:19.360 --> 36:24.264
WELCOME TO THE HAUL ROAD.

36:24.298 --> 36:25.365

37:13.114 --> 37:14.648
IT'S CLOSED BEHIND US.

37:23.925 --> 37:25.558
AND STAY WARM, KEEP EVERYTHING

37:27.061 --> 37:28.161
HOPEFULLY IT'LL QUIT BY TOMORROW

37:28.229 --> 37:29.162
MORNING.

39:08.662 --> 39:10.964
COULD SEND LISA PLUNGING OFF THE

39:11.065 --> 39:12.966
CLIFF.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.868
>> I'M TRYING TO REMAIN CALM AND

39:14.902 --> 39:18.605
KEEP MY MIND CLEAR.

39:18.639 --> 39:19.773
CAN YOU SEE THE EDGE OF THE

39:19.807 --> 39:20.507
ROAD?

39:20.541 --> 39:22.575
'CAUSE I SURE CAN'T.

39:27.581 --> 39:29.716
DRIFTED PRETTY GOOD HERE.

39:33.721 --> 39:34.888
LET'S HOPE THERE'S NO SNOWBANKS,

39:34.955 --> 39:36.790
'CAUSE I CAN'T SEE IF THERE IS.

39:42.063 --> 39:43.596
HMM.

39:48.836 --> 39:52.772
LOST THE DELINEATORS THERE.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.974
THERE WE GO.

39:55.009 --> 39:56.409
I GOT A LONG HOOD, AND I CAN'T

39:56.444 --> 39:58.344
SEE OVER IT.

40:07.455 --> 40:09.055
>> narrator: FINALLY, LISA AND

40:09.123 --> 40:11.424
HER CONVOY BREAK THROUGH.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.659
>> WELL, WE'RE STILL ON THE

40:12.693 --> 40:13.393
ROAD.

40:13.427 --> 40:14.994
[laughs]

40:15.062 --> 40:16.229
>> narrator: OVER THE PASS WITH

40:16.263 --> 40:18.565
CLEAR ROAD AHEAD, LISA'S FIRST

40:18.599 --> 40:20.600
HOT LOAD WILL GET IN UNDER THE

40:20.668 --> 40:22.068
WIRE.

40:22.103 --> 40:23.069
>> WE'RE ALL MOVING ALONG.

40:23.137 --> 40:24.871
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEMS.

40:24.905 --> 40:26.239
THERE'S GOOD VISIBILITY.

40:26.307 --> 40:31.878
GOT OURSELVES A CONVOY.

40:31.946 --> 40:33.113
>> narrator: ON THE NORTH SIDE

40:33.147 --> 40:34.481
OF ATIGUN, THE SOUND OF LISA'S

40:34.515 --> 40:37.317
CONVOY ROLLING BY INSPIRES RAY

40:37.384 --> 40:39.018
AND THE OTHER DRIVERS TO MAKE

40:39.053 --> 40:41.221
THEIR OWN RUN THROUGH THE PASS.

40:41.255 --> 40:42.522
>> THERE'S PLENTY OF SNOW ON THE

40:42.556 --> 40:45.291
PASS, THAT'S FOR SURE.

40:45.326 --> 40:47.127
YOU GOT BIG DRIFTS HERE.

40:47.161 --> 40:49.596
BIG DRIFTS.

40:49.663 --> 40:51.197
OOH.

40:57.271 --> 40:58.505
OH, THAT'S UGLY.

40:58.572 --> 41:00.607
ALL THE OTHER TRUCKS BUSTED A--

41:00.641 --> 41:02.208
A LITTLE TRAIL THROUGH HERE.

41:02.243 --> 41:03.309
SO AS LONG AS WE STAY IN THEIR

41:03.344 --> 41:09.048
TRACKS, WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

41:09.083 --> 41:10.216
A LOT OF THE GUYS WERE TALKING

41:10.251 --> 41:15.221
ABOUT AVALANCHE DANGER.

41:15.256 --> 41:17.423
IT'S BEEN SNOWIN', BLOWIN'.

41:17.458 --> 41:19.192
AND ALL THE SNOW GETS PACKED IN

41:19.226 --> 41:20.760
ONE CERTAIN SPOT AND GETS HEAVY,

41:20.794 --> 41:22.328
AND THEN IT LETS GO AND...

41:22.363 --> 41:23.496
OH, YEAH, TRUCKS HAVE BEEN HIT

41:23.564 --> 41:25.298
BY AVALANCHES RIGHT HERE AND

41:25.332 --> 41:30.603
KNOCKED OVER THE GUARD RAIL.

41:30.638 --> 41:32.305
WE'LL JUST GET THROUGH HERE AND

41:32.373 --> 41:34.207
GET OUT OF HERE.

41:38.312 --> 41:39.579
>> narrator: IT'S NOT LONG

41:39.613 --> 41:41.281
BEFORE RAY, TOO, FIGHTS THROUGH

41:41.315 --> 41:44.050
THE DYING STORM TO SAFETY.

41:44.118 --> 41:46.319
>> THE WORST OF IT'S OVER NOW.

41:46.353 --> 41:47.487
WE'RE OFF OF ATIGUN.

41:47.521 --> 41:49.122
AND WE'RE HEADING BACK TO

41:49.190 --> 41:51.858
FAIRBANKS.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.860
>> narrator: AN HOUR LATER, JACK

41:53.894 --> 41:55.862
JESSEE MAKES THE 4,700 FOOT

41:55.930 --> 41:58.031
CLIMB TO FIND THAT HIS PLAN HAS

41:58.098 --> 41:59.199
PAID OFF.

41:59.233 --> 42:00.133
>> WELL, I CAN SEE THE TOP

42:00.167 --> 42:00.833
AGAIN.

42:00.868 --> 42:02.235
I THINK I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

42:02.269 --> 42:03.403
>> narrator: WHILE LISA AND RAY

42:03.470 --> 42:05.238
SPENT A FREEZING NIGHT STRANDED

42:05.306 --> 42:07.640
IN THE PASS, JACK WAITED OUT THE

42:07.675 --> 42:09.509
STORM, SAFE AND WARM IN

42:09.577 --> 42:10.777
COLDFOOT.

42:10.811 --> 42:13.680
>> MADE IT UP ATIGUN AGAIN.

42:13.747 --> 42:16.115
NORTHBOUND, GOING DOWN ATIGUN.

42:16.183 --> 42:17.317
>> narrator: WITH A CLEAR ROAD

42:17.384 --> 42:19.552
AHEAD, IT'S A STRAIGHT SHOT TO

42:19.587 --> 42:21.754
PRUDHOE BAY.

42:21.822 --> 42:24.123
AS JACK ROLLS IN, THE VAT TRUCK

42:24.191 --> 42:26.125
CREWS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IS

42:26.160 --> 42:27.827
NOW ON HAND.

42:27.861 --> 42:29.395
>> WELL, WE FINALLY MADE IT.

42:29.430 --> 42:30.597
THE WEATHER CAUSED A LITTLE BIT

42:30.664 --> 42:32.232
OF PROBLEMS THERE, SO IT'S A DAY

42:32.266 --> 42:33.299
LATER THAN THEY WANTED IT.

42:33.367 --> 42:34.734
BUT I GOT IT HERE.

42:34.768 --> 42:35.935
THEY'LL WORK ON GETTING IT

42:35.970 --> 42:36.936
STARTED AND GETTING IT DELIVERED

42:36.971 --> 42:38.271
TOMORROW.

42:38.305 --> 42:39.505
UH, ALL I WANT TO DO IS TRY TO

42:39.573 --> 42:42.141
GET OUT OF HERE AND GET HOME.

42:42.176 --> 42:43.409
>> narrator: AS THE STORM

42:43.477 --> 42:45.845
SETTLES DOWN, THE DASH FOR THE

42:45.913 --> 42:48.314
CASH IS JUST HEATING UP.

42:48.349 --> 42:50.383
[honking horn]

42:50.451 --> 42:52.685
JACK'S SLOW AND STEADY STRATEGY

42:52.753 --> 42:54.387
GOT HIM SAFELY THROUGH THE STORM

42:54.421 --> 42:56.823
TO DELIVER HIS FIFTH LOAD.

42:56.857 --> 42:59.459
GREG AND HUGH AVOIDED THE CHAOS

42:59.493 --> 43:01.995
OF ATIGUN, AND BOTH RACKED UP

43:02.029 --> 43:04.464
QUICK TRIPS,

43:04.465 --> 43:06.833
WHILE LISA, ALEX, AND RAY RAN

43:06.867 --> 43:08.735
THE GAUNTLET, KEEPING THE RACE

43:08.769 --> 43:14.674
TIGHT BETWEEN ALL DRIVERS.

43:14.675 --> 43:17.377

43:30.090 --> 43:31.557
