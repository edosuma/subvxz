&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:08.240 --> 00:10.840
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.440

&lrm;Thanks for showing up!

00:31.200 --> 00:34.880
&lrm;So, check this out.
&lrm;I've got the biggest scoop!

00:35.000 --> 00:38.600
&lrm;But FYI, it's seriously hush hush.
&lrm;Top secret. Classified information.

00:38.720 --> 00:42.360
&lrm;-You know who Ladybug is?
&lrm;-No. But it's almost as hot.

00:42.480 --> 00:43.520
&lrm;Marinette is...

00:43.640 --> 00:45.880
&lrm;Wait.
&lrm;Do you think this is such a good idea?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.240
&lrm;I don't think it is. I know it is!

00:48.360 --> 00:52.080
&lrm;But remember, girls,
&lrm;your lips are sealed. Got it?

00:52.200 --> 00:55.120
&lrm;Well, Marinette
&lrm;is head over heels for somebody!

00:55.240 --> 00:57.600
&lrm;- Yeah. Adrien!
&lrm;- [laughter]

00:58.240 --> 01:01.280
&lrm;-What? But how did you know?
&lrm;-Well, it is pretty obvious!

01:01.400 --> 01:04.080
&lrm;So do you think...
&lrm;I mean... Adrien knows too?

01:04.200 --> 01:06.960
&lrm;No way.
&lrm;Boys never pick up on things like that.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.080
&lrm;Right. Let's get down to business.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.400
&lrm;Your mission,
&lrm;is to arrange a ridiculously romantic date

01:13.520 --> 01:16.360
&lrm;- between Marinette and Adrien.
&lrm;- Oh, that's so sweet!

01:16.480 --> 01:18.280
&lrm;- Great!
&lrm;- Big time!

01:18.400 --> 01:21.600
&lrm;We know we can always count on you,
&lrm;so you can count on us, too!

01:21.720 --> 01:24.360
&lrm;- Aw, thanks, girls!
&lrm;- You're up, Marinette!

01:24.480 --> 01:28.320
&lrm;Alya and I have come up with a plan.
&lrm;It's called "Operation Secret Garden"!

01:28.440 --> 01:30.560
&lrm;Excuse me, but why do we need a plan?

01:30.720 --> 01:32.840
&lrm;Can't Marinette just ask Adrien out?

01:32.960 --> 01:35.200
&lrm;[laughter]

01:35.320 --> 01:38.080
&lrm;Seriously? This is Marinette
&lrm;we're talking about here!

01:38.200 --> 01:41.000
&lrm;Now, each of you
&lrm;will have a code name based on a flower.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.120
&lrm;Alix you'll be "Violet",
&lrm;Mylène, you'll be "Sunflower",

01:44.240 --> 01:46.880
&lrm;Juleka, you'll be "Rose",
&lrm;and Rose will be "Tulip."

01:47.000 --> 01:51.080
&lrm;- Uh... Why isn't my name "Rose?"
&lrm;- Because "Rose" is your real name!

01:51.200 --> 01:53.080
&lrm;It won't be a code name
&lrm;if we call you "Rose!"

01:54.680 --> 01:58.440
&lrm;This afternoon, "Buttercup" has
&lrm;a photo shoot at the Trocadéro fountains.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.880
&lrm;- Adrien!
&lrm;- Ah!

02:04.120 --> 02:09.400
&lrm;His security guard, aka "The Nanny",
&lrm;will be waiting for him in the car.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.360
&lrm;He's supposed to take Buttercup home,
&lrm;except that's not gonna happen!

02:13.480 --> 02:15.440
&lrm;This is where you guys come in!

02:15.560 --> 02:19.200
&lrm;Step one, Rose will have a fake
&lrm;no-parking sign. She'll go over to...

02:19.320 --> 02:21.040
&lrm;- Who's Rose again?
&lrm;- Me, of course!

02:21.160 --> 02:27.400
&lrm;No, Rose, it's Juleka! You're Tulip!
&lrm;Violet, Sunflower, Rose, Tulip!

02:27.520 --> 02:29.240
&lrm;- [sighs]
&lrm;- So, step one...

02:29.360 --> 02:31.960
&lrm;Rose, you put the sign
&lrm;next to The Nanny's chariot.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.320
&lrm;Step two. Sunflower,
&lrm;you'll go and find a police officer

02:39.440 --> 02:41.560
&lrm;and say to him,
&lrm;"Hello, Mr Police Officer!

02:41.680 --> 02:43.440
&lrm;That car's parked illegally!"

02:43.560 --> 02:46.160
&lrm;"You don't say!
&lrm;I'll enforce the law this second!

02:46.280 --> 02:47.960
&lrm;Thank you, young lady!"

02:48.080 --> 02:49.480
&lrm;[blows whistle]

02:49.600 --> 02:51.320
&lrm;Oh! Grr!

02:52.960 --> 02:57.040
&lrm;Step three. No more Nanny!
&lrm;Step four. Tigerlily will let us know

02:57.160 --> 02:59.080
&lrm;as soon as Buttercup's done.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.320
&lrm;Tigerlily.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.320
&lrm;But instead of meeting back up
&lrm;with The Nanny, Adrien's going to find...

03:09.440 --> 03:10.520
&lrm;Lotus!

03:10.640 --> 03:12.240
&lrm;That's Marinette!

03:12.360 --> 03:14.640
&lrm;But when Buttercup
&lrm;sees the chariot's gone,

03:14.760 --> 03:15.960
&lrm;he'll text his Nanny, won't he?

03:17.800 --> 03:21.920
&lrm;Impossible. Buttercup always leaves
&lrm;his personal items in the car,

03:22.040 --> 03:23.520
&lrm;even his phone.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.080
&lrm;Such a professional!

03:25.200 --> 03:28.080
&lrm;She knows everything about Adrien.
&lrm;Creepy, no?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.920
&lrm;Yeah! It's so romantic!

03:31.040 --> 03:32.880
&lrm;So, then...

03:33.000 --> 03:34.320
&lrm;"Hey, Marinette."

03:37.480 --> 03:40.960
&lrm;"What are you doing here?
&lrm;What a incredible, crazy, coincidence!"

03:41.080 --> 03:44.360
&lrm;Now Tulip will give the signal
&lrm;to the rickshaw driver

03:44.480 --> 03:48.160
&lrm;to come and park in the car spot.
&lrm;Then all I need to do is say to Adrien...

03:48.280 --> 03:50.880
&lrm;Blblblblblblblb!

03:51.000 --> 03:52.520
&lrm;[laughter]

03:52.640 --> 03:54.640
&lrm;You're right. That's usually how it goes.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.440
&lrm;But this time, I'm really ready.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.880
&lrm;I've got you guys with me.
&lrm;I'll do it, I promise!

03:59.000 --> 04:00.280
&lrm;- You'll be great.
&lrm;- Yeah!

04:00.400 --> 04:04.240
&lrm;So I say to him, "Since your car's
&lrm;not here, let's ride home together.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.240
&lrm;Look, there's a rickshaw, right here!"

04:07.360 --> 04:11.680
&lrm;"Awesome idea, Marinette. I've always
&lrm;dreamed of going on a rickshaw with you!"

04:14.560 --> 04:17.040
&lrm;We take a really romantic ride
&lrm;along the Seine

04:17.160 --> 04:20.040
&lrm;and over the Pont des Arts bridge,
&lrm;where we run into André,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.680
&lrm;the sweethearts' ice-cream maker!

04:31.240 --> 04:34.600
&lrm;Then Violet skates by
&lrm;and showers us with rose petals!

04:39.560 --> 04:41.600
&lrm;It's gonna be perfect.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.360
&lrm;It's... it's... so beautiful!

04:44.480 --> 04:45.960
&lrm;Any questions?

04:46.080 --> 04:48.840
&lrm;- Which flower am I, again?
&lrm;- You're Rose.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.840
&lrm;- That's right, right?
&lrm;- Mmm-hmm.

04:50.960 --> 04:54.200
&lrm;- Yes!
&lrm;- Operation Secret Garden, here we come!

05:00.560 --> 05:04.080
&lrm;Come on, more happy! The smile like you're
&lrm;smelling a delicious lunch in the kitchen!

05:04.800 --> 05:06.920
&lrm;Ah! No, no! We need...

05:09.840 --> 05:11.000
&lrm;A lollipop!

05:16.840 --> 05:18.240
&lrm;There!

05:18.360 --> 05:20.280
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop!

05:22.000 --> 05:25.200
&lrm;Now we have good taste! Mmm-hmm!

05:26.320 --> 05:28.360
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop!

05:28.480 --> 05:32.840
&lrm;No, August! Lollipops are not for babies!
&lrm;Your snack is a delicious bottle of milk!

05:38.440 --> 05:40.400
&lrm;Are all the flowers planted?

05:41.280 --> 05:42.240
&lrm;Rose planted!

05:44.120 --> 05:46.040
&lrm;Sunflower planted!

05:46.880 --> 05:47.840
&lrm;Tulip planted!

05:49.760 --> 05:51.200
&lrm;Perfect! Go, Rose!

05:51.400 --> 05:53.880
&lrm;- Uh... Me?
&lrm;- No, the other Rose!

05:54.480 --> 05:56.720
&lrm;- Hmm...
&lrm;- [chuckles]

05:59.440 --> 06:01.000
&lrm;Huh? [gasps]

06:02.920 --> 06:05.040
&lrm;- Um, you guys, I've got a problem.
&lrm;- Rose?

06:05.240 --> 06:07.600
&lrm;- Yeah? What?
&lrm;- It's stuck in the grate.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.840
&lrm;- Rose! Louder!
&lrm;- Yeah? What?

06:10.040 --> 06:11.360
&lrm;[both] Oh! Shh!

06:12.520 --> 06:13.920
&lrm;Ugh!

06:17.000 --> 06:18.520
&lrm;Uh-oh!

06:21.400 --> 06:25.400
&lrm;- What's this fake sign made of?
&lrm;- Metal, like road signs are made of. Why?

06:25.600 --> 06:28.360
&lrm;Couldn't you have made it
&lrm;out of cardboard or something?

06:28.960 --> 06:31.200
&lrm;Go and get the police officer!

06:31.400 --> 06:33.960
&lrm;Caution! Buttercup's photo shoot
&lrm;will be over soon!

06:34.160 --> 06:37.200
&lrm;Ah, seriously? Enough with the chitchat.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.440
&lrm;I know you!
&lrm;You're in class with my daughter!

06:42.640 --> 06:45.200
&lrm;Hello, sir...
&lrm;I just wanted to tell you something...

06:45.400 --> 06:48.120
&lrm;Huh? Tell me about it!
&lrm;These pigeons are such a nuisance!

06:48.320 --> 06:50.760
&lrm;- Huh?
&lrm;- Come on, Rose, do it now!

06:50.960 --> 06:53.000
&lrm;OK!

06:53.200 --> 06:56.560
&lrm;- Not you, Tulip! The other Rose!
&lrm;- [gasps] No, wait!

06:58.520 --> 07:00.120
&lrm;Come on, Rose, you can do it!

07:01.240 --> 07:03.680
&lrm;- Illegally parked car!
&lrm;- Hmm?

07:03.880 --> 07:05.480
&lrm;Yes!

07:05.680 --> 07:06.640
&lrm;Oh!

07:09.840 --> 07:11.440
&lrm;Thank you, young lady!

07:11.640 --> 07:12.800
&lrm;Great job, Rose!

07:16.320 --> 07:20.120
&lrm;No! Look at me! Give me your best smile!

07:20.320 --> 07:22.280
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop!

07:22.480 --> 07:26.440
&lrm;No, August, Mummy told you already.
&lrm;You're too young for lollipops!

07:28.520 --> 07:30.560
&lrm;That poor lady.
&lrm;She could really use a hand!

07:30.760 --> 07:32.680
&lrm;If you do that, Adrien will see you!

07:35.200 --> 07:37.000
&lrm;Oh, here we go, honey.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.400
&lrm;Sir! Move this vehicle right away.
&lrm;This is a no-parking zone!

07:45.720 --> 07:46.800
&lrm;Grr!

07:48.200 --> 07:49.880
&lrm;Move it, move it, move it!

07:50.080 --> 07:52.360
&lrm;- Hey, watch it!
&lrm;- He's right, be careful!

07:55.880 --> 07:57.280
&lrm;U-turn, please!

07:59.960 --> 08:01.480
&lrm;Mmm-hmm.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.320
&lrm;Bravo, girls! Step two, commence!

08:07.040 --> 08:08.560
&lrm;Eh?

08:10.360 --> 08:11.920
&lrm;Grr! Grr!

08:13.520 --> 08:16.640
&lrm;Seating! Perfect! Hold it right there!

08:22.760 --> 08:24.960
&lrm;Lotus! Uh... Marinette! Stay here!

08:26.960 --> 08:30.000
&lrm;Hello, ma'am! Hello, little baby!

08:30.920 --> 08:32.480
&lrm;Thank you so much!

08:33.039 --> 08:34.520
&lrm;All right, have a good day!

08:34.720 --> 08:37.360
&lrm;Look out! Buttercup's on the move!

08:45.840 --> 08:48.560
&lrm;Sorry!

08:50.000 --> 08:51.160
&lrm;- Here you go.
&lrm;- Thank you!

08:51.360 --> 08:53.080
&lrm;You're welcome! Bye!

08:58.720 --> 09:01.240
&lrm;Red alert! The Nanny's back!

09:03.320 --> 09:04.760
&lrm;- Um...
&lrm;- Yes?

09:06.080 --> 09:08.480
&lrm;Hey, you, Mister! Over there!
&lrm;You've asked for it!

09:08.680 --> 09:12.200
&lrm;Here are fines for a parking violation,
&lrm;non-compliance with orders

09:12.400 --> 09:15.480
&lrm;and for infuriating
&lrm;a usually cheerful police officer!

09:17.080 --> 09:20.120
&lrm;A man who takes his work very seriously,

09:20.320 --> 09:22.960
&lrm;whose blood is boiled
&lrm;by the slightest shortfall...

09:23.160 --> 09:26.920
&lrm;That's what I call
&lrm;an easy target for my dear akumas.

09:33.640 --> 09:37.640
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him!

09:42.880 --> 09:45.280
&lrm;[wailing baby]

09:45.480 --> 09:47.640
&lrm;Lollipop!

09:47.840 --> 09:50.360
&lrm;You're being quite stubborn today, August!

10:00.960 --> 10:03.800
&lrm;What happened? His emotions just vanished!

10:04.880 --> 10:08.400
&lrm;Lollipop! Lollipop! Lollipop!

10:11.320 --> 10:14.480
&lrm;This wasn't what I had in mind.
&lrm;But, why not, after all?

10:14.680 --> 10:17.120
&lrm;What could be
&lrm;more emotionally powerful than a baby

10:17.320 --> 10:19.480
&lrm;throwing a giant temper tantrum?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.880
&lrm;Gigantitan, I am Hawk Moth.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.000
&lrm;Hawk-mo?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.960
&lrm;No... Not Haw-mo.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.840
&lrm;Just Hawk Moth. Well...
&lrm;You're going to be... big and strong,

10:32.040 --> 10:36.000
&lrm;and you'll get to do... whatever you want!

10:36.200 --> 10:40.240
&lrm;But in return, you must bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

10:40.640 --> 10:46.520
&lrm;- Lollipop?
&lrm;- Not lollipop! Miraculous. Mi-ra-cu-lous!

10:52.560 --> 10:56.840
&lrm;- My little baby!
&lrm;- Lollipop!

10:59.320 --> 11:00.640
&lrm;Lollipop!

11:04.840 --> 11:07.920
&lrm;Kids these days, they grow up so fast.
&lrm;Am I right?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.520
&lrm;- It's a baby!
&lrm;- Whoa! Don't blink now! Come on!

11:12.720 --> 11:13.800
&lrm;Lollipop!

11:17.800 --> 11:20.080
&lrm;Lollipop!

11:25.800 --> 11:27.400
&lrm;Ah!

11:29.880 --> 11:31.760
&lrm;- August!
&lrm;- Stay out of danger, ma'am!

11:31.960 --> 11:35.400
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir will be here soon
&lrm;and save your little August!

11:40.880 --> 11:43.280
&lrm;Oh!
&lrm;I was just about to take a cheese break!

11:43.480 --> 11:46.920
&lrm;Oh, don't be such a baby, Plagg!
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

12:05.320 --> 12:07.040
&lrm;Girls, where is Lotus?

12:08.320 --> 12:10.320
&lrm;Marinette, where is she?

12:11.760 --> 12:13.760
&lrm;Hey, look!

12:16.280 --> 12:18.320
&lrm;[screaming]

12:21.560 --> 12:24.400
&lrm;Well, you're the biggest
&lrm;rug rat I've ever seen!

12:25.480 --> 12:26.440
&lrm;Kitty!

12:26.640 --> 12:28.920
&lrm;Let's go splish-splash, Megababy!

12:30.040 --> 12:31.760
&lrm;You can't catch me!

12:33.200 --> 12:37.360
&lrm;Let's get our feet nice and wet.
&lrm;But we can't squish anyone, OK?

12:38.280 --> 12:40.320
&lrm;Lure him where there's nothing to destroy.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.120
&lrm;Nice move, Cat Noir!

12:42.320 --> 12:44.640
&lrm;Looks like
&lrm;that romantic outing is on hold.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.560
&lrm;We'll be pausing
&lrm;for an epic battle instead.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.800
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

13:05.320 --> 13:06.600
&lrm;Lolli...

13:09.240 --> 13:11.040
&lrm;Well, hey there, kitty-cat!

13:11.240 --> 13:13.480
&lrm;I see you're not much
&lrm;of a natural with kids.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.520
&lrm;Are you kidding?
&lrm;We were just playing a fun game of tag!

13:17.960 --> 13:19.800
&lrm;The akuma's probably in his bracelet.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.000
&lrm;Gigantitan,
&lrm;watch out for the very naughty Ladybug!

13:29.160 --> 13:30.600
&lrm;Whoa! How about that?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.320
&lrm;You're not a natural with kids either!
&lrm;Nice flying!

13:33.520 --> 13:37.760
&lrm;Ha, ha! For your information, I've never
&lrm;babysat anything heavier than ten tons!

13:40.600 --> 13:41.720
&lrm;Kitty!

13:42.760 --> 13:43.720
&lrm;Yes!

13:45.760 --> 13:47.720
&lrm;Ah! No!

13:49.880 --> 13:52.760
&lrm;Change of plans. To calm a baby down
&lrm;just put him in a playpen!

13:52.960 --> 13:55.160
&lrm;Where are we gonna find
&lrm;a playpen his size?

13:55.360 --> 13:58.080
&lrm;The Eiffel Tower! We'll pen him up
&lrm;in there with my yoyo,

13:58.280 --> 13:59.960
&lrm;sing him some lullabies...

14:00.160 --> 14:03.240
&lrm;We can read him a bedtime story,
&lrm;make cooing noises... Coo! Coo!

14:03.440 --> 14:05.200
&lrm;Then, when he's getting sleepy, bam!

14:05.400 --> 14:07.200
&lrm;You'll destroy his bracelet!

14:07.400 --> 14:10.560
&lrm;Interesting idea, Milady.
&lrm;But how are we going to get him there?

14:10.760 --> 14:12.640
&lrm;Don't you have a simpler plan?

14:12.840 --> 14:15.160
&lrm;If this is too complicated,
&lrm;just copy what I do!

14:17.280 --> 14:19.760
&lrm;- Yoo-hoo!
&lrm;- Over here, little guy!

14:21.400 --> 14:23.960
&lrm;Once we get him in his playpen,
&lrm;I'll sing him a lullaby.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.080
&lrm;- We don't want to burst his eardrums!
&lrm;- What? I have a great voice, you know!

14:28.280 --> 14:30.960
&lrm;I'll miaow you a serenade
&lrm;one of these days.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.840
&lrm;Lollipop!

14:36.000 --> 14:37.920
&lrm;Lollipop!

14:39.240 --> 14:41.080
&lrm;- Hey! Hey, over here!
&lrm;- We're here!

14:41.280 --> 14:42.520
&lrm;Big baby!

14:42.720 --> 14:44.320
&lrm;We're losing him, Cat Noir!

14:44.880 --> 14:46.240
&lrm;Lollipop!

14:50.120 --> 14:51.240
&lrm;[crying]

14:51.440 --> 14:52.920
&lrm;[honking]

15:00.320 --> 15:02.080
&lrm;- Vroom!
&lrm;- Gah!

15:02.280 --> 15:04.920
&lrm;Vroom, vroom!

15:05.120 --> 15:08.120
&lrm;I loved playing with cars
&lrm;when I was a kid, too!

15:09.960 --> 15:13.200
&lrm;Look! He's going to his playpen
&lrm;all by himself! Good job, Kitty!

15:16.600 --> 15:19.960
&lrm;No! Stop playing!
&lrm;Attack the kittycat and Ladybug!

15:20.160 --> 15:21.680
&lrm;Vroom!

15:21.880 --> 15:23.120
&lrm;Oh, no!

15:25.760 --> 15:26.800
&lrm;Here we go!

15:35.680 --> 15:37.000
&lrm;[whistles]

15:47.320 --> 15:49.600
&lrm;Hurry! Use your cataclysm on his bracelet!

15:49.800 --> 15:51.520
&lrm;At your command, Milady!

15:51.720 --> 15:53.520
&lrm;Cataclysm!

16:02.800 --> 16:04.760
&lrm;Whoa!

16:12.960 --> 16:16.120
&lrm;[groans] Did she take
&lrm;the rickshaw ride with Adrien or not?

16:19.280 --> 16:20.400
&lrm;[screams]

16:25.080 --> 16:27.360
&lrm;I hear your ice-cream's the best in Paris!

16:29.080 --> 16:31.360
&lrm;Uh... thank you, Cat Noir!

16:38.920 --> 16:42.520
&lrm;Turn around! Look at the mean Ladybug!
&lrm;Grab her!

16:43.400 --> 16:45.640
&lrm;Lollipop!

16:48.280 --> 16:51.800
&lrm;Hey, silly baby!
&lrm;This isn't a delicious lollipop!

16:52.000 --> 16:54.880
&lrm;- Ah!
&lrm;- Supersize!

16:55.960 --> 16:58.720
&lrm;- Hold on tight, Ladybug!
&lrm;- Thanks, girls!

17:00.200 --> 17:01.600
&lrm;Lollipop!

17:03.160 --> 17:06.720
&lrm;No! Don't let the ladybug get away!
&lrm;Argh!

17:08.240 --> 17:09.960
&lrm;Quick! We don't have much time left!

17:10.160 --> 17:11.960
&lrm;OK. Enough with complicated plans!

17:12.160 --> 17:14.280
&lrm;Sometimes it's best to get to the point!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.560
&lrm;Lucky charm!

17:22.359 --> 17:23.400
&lrm;- Gift wrap?
&lrm;- Great!

17:23.599 --> 17:26.640
&lrm;Now figure something out
&lrm;so we can "wrap this up!"

17:31.440 --> 17:33.080
&lrm;Got it!

17:36.000 --> 17:40.520
&lrm;Girls, I can't do it any more. Run!

17:42.560 --> 17:45.040
&lrm;Lollipop!

17:49.560 --> 17:51.520
&lrm;[crying]

17:54.520 --> 17:56.880
&lrm;Who wants a nice tasty lollipop?

17:57.080 --> 17:59.600
&lrm;Lollipop!

18:04.440 --> 18:07.640
&lrm;You've heard of the Trojan horse?
&lrm;Now meet the Parisian lollipop!

18:13.040 --> 18:15.400
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

18:19.200 --> 18:21.600
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:24.560 --> 18:25.520
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

18:29.720 --> 18:31.920
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:44.680 --> 18:46.000
&lrm;- Kitty!
&lrm;- OK,

18:46.200 --> 18:48.400
&lrm;you are a natural with babies, after all!

18:48.600 --> 18:52.280
&lrm;- August!
&lrm;- Mama!

18:56.160 --> 18:58.360
&lrm;We gotta get going! Bye-bye, little guy!

18:59.560 --> 19:02.320
&lrm;Thank you, Cat Noir. Thank you, Ladybug.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.400
&lrm;Thank you!

19:05.080 --> 19:09.240
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir! Gigantitan
&lrm;may not have been big enough for the job,

19:09.440 --> 19:12.920
&lrm;but I promise my next villain
&lrm;will be more than you can handle!

19:16.320 --> 19:20.120
&lrm;- Hey, guys!
&lrm;- [laughter]

19:20.320 --> 19:23.280
&lrm;- Marinette!
&lrm;- I was so worried about you!

19:23.480 --> 19:26.000
&lrm;I was worried too.
&lrm;I looked all over for you guys!

19:26.200 --> 19:29.880
&lrm;- I'm so glad everything worked out OK!
&lrm;- Except for your date with Adrien.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.360
&lrm;- Oh, yeah, where did he go?
&lrm;- Oh! There he is!

19:35.560 --> 19:38.520
&lrm;- Maybe we can finish the job, after all.
&lrm;- Awesome!

19:38.720 --> 19:40.440
&lrm;No. No more complicated plans!

19:40.640 --> 19:43.440
&lrm;Sometimes it's best
&lrm;to just get straight to the point!

19:44.400 --> 19:45.600
&lrm;Adrien!

19:48.320 --> 19:50.880
&lrm;Marinette, what are you doing here?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.800
&lrm;- Is she going to do it?
&lrm;- It's just like a romantic movie!

19:54.000 --> 19:57.200
&lrm;I came here to sketch!
&lrm;I can't believe we've run into each other!

19:57.400 --> 20:00.360
&lrm;- Hey, would you like to... ?
&lrm;- [honking]

20:00.560 --> 20:04.400
&lrm;Hang pout, I mean, hang about?
&lrm;No... hag out?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.520
&lrm;[honking]

20:05.720 --> 20:08.360
&lrm;Oh, forget it!
&lrm;Better not keep your guard waiting.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.080
&lrm;Uh... OK.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.280
&lrm;But we could take you home, if you wanted?

20:19.400 --> 20:22.280
&lrm;No, it's OK.
&lrm;I'll take a cole slaw home, thanks!

20:24.400 --> 20:29.520
&lrm;OK... Enjoy your meal, then!
&lrm;See you at school tomorrow!

20:35.880 --> 20:40.600
&lrm;Why did I say no? I'm so lame! I could
&lrm;have ridden home with him, in his car!

20:40.800 --> 20:43.720
&lrm;At least you got a sentence out
&lrm;without losing your cool!

20:43.920 --> 20:48.760
&lrm;- One sentence out of three. Not bad!
&lrm;- You'll get there in the end!

20:48.960 --> 20:50.880
&lrm;- Sure will.
&lrm;- Thanks, girls!

20:53.840 --> 20:56.840
&lrm;Don't tell me "Buttercup" left
&lrm;the flowerbed with the Nanny.

20:57.040 --> 21:01.560
&lrm;Yup! But it's all good! Come on, BFF,
&lrm;let's take a ride on the "cole slaw!"

21:01.760 --> 21:04.400
&lrm;- Please tell me I didn't say that!
&lrm;- Yeah!

21:04.520 --> 21:07.200
&lrm;[laughing]
