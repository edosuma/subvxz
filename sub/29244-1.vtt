00:34.566 --> 00:35.566
Ryan.

00:36.574 --> 00:37.652
Yeah?

00:37.653 --> 00:41.253
We should have sex right now.

00:41.254 --> 00:42.254
One,

00:43.105 --> 00:44.105
two,

00:45.366 --> 00:46.366
three.

00:54.367 --> 00:55.372
Shh, shh.

00:55.373 --> 00:57.432
Jono, Jono's asleep.

00:57.433 --> 00:58.598
Jono.

00:58.599 --> 01:01.133
Wait, Jono's not here.

01:02.340 --> 01:03.173
Jono's not here this weekend.

01:03.174 --> 01:04.491
Beth is gone, too!

01:04.492 --> 01:05.325
We have the place to ourselves.

01:05.325 --> 01:06.180
We have the place to ourselves.

01:06.181 --> 01:07.421
We have the place to ourselves!

01:12.801 --> 01:13.971
Our kitchen!

01:13.972 --> 01:15.677
We have the kitchen to ourselves!

01:15.678 --> 01:17.610
This is Jonathan's room, get out!

01:17.611 --> 01:18.480
Okay.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.380
Roommate's gonna kill me.

01:19.381 --> 01:20.868
Ohh, let's go in the pool!

01:20.869 --> 01:21.869
Let's go in the pool,
let's go in the pool.

01:21.869 --> 01:22.869
Pool.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.540
Why didn't you jump?

01:32.541 --> 01:34.057
What if the neighbors see?

01:34.058 --> 01:34.891
What do you care?

01:34.892 --> 01:36.617
They're not your neighbors.

01:36.618 --> 01:37.618
I don't.

01:40.188 --> 01:41.028
Okay.

01:41.029 --> 01:42.097
Hang on one sec, I've got an idea.

01:42.098 --> 01:43.515
I've got an idea.

01:45.199 --> 01:50.199
What's your idea?

01:55.150 --> 01:56.150
Mm.

01:56.940 --> 01:57.773
Ooh, ah.

01:57.774 --> 01:59.093
It's your next creation.

02:00.986 --> 02:02.329
Oh, my God.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.855
It's so good.

02:03.856 --> 02:04.778
Mmm!

02:04.778 --> 02:05.630
Mm.

02:05.631 --> 02:06.939
We can do anything today.

02:06.940 --> 02:08.773
Anything at all, what do you wanna do?

02:25.470 --> 02:28.514
How is Cabbage Patch Dolls
not a top toy of the 80s?

02:28.515 --> 02:31.766
Why is a Tamagotchi
not a top toy of the 90s?

02:31.767 --> 02:34.315
What's a Tamagotchi?

02:34.316 --> 02:35.316
Really?

02:44.644 --> 02:47.319
Hey, which one of these would you post?

02:47.320 --> 02:49.115
Those are the same cupcake, right?

02:49.116 --> 02:50.803
Yeah, but different angles.

02:55.138 --> 02:56.759
Oh, give me your laptop.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.897
Blowjob on a boat?

02:57.898 --> 02:58.880
Yeah.

02:58.881 --> 03:00.799
- Been tied up?
- Yup.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.139
Kissed before exchanging names?

03:03.140 --> 03:04.030
Yup.

03:04.030 --> 03:04.863
Squirted?

03:04.864 --> 03:06.669
No, wait, that's not even
a real thing.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.349
Prostate massage?

03:08.350 --> 03:09.627
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?

03:09.628 --> 03:11.211
- Ahhh.
- Just once?

03:18.207 --> 03:20.235
Hey, have
you seen my phone cord?

03:23.186 --> 03:24.316
There it is.

03:24.317 --> 03:26.795
Why do you keep so much stuff with you?

03:26.796 --> 03:28.796
Well, you never know.

03:42.316 --> 03:43.149
Enough of these.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.617
Let's go to Angie's boudoir album.

03:45.618 --> 03:47.589
Are you gonna put
yourself in there again?

03:47.590 --> 03:48.496
Maybe.

03:48.497 --> 03:49.558
Yeah, you want to?

03:49.559 --> 03:50.524
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

03:50.525 --> 03:51.834
How 'bout both of us?

03:51.835 --> 03:53.227
Oh yeah, if you want.

03:53.228 --> 03:54.395
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:17.160 --> 04:18.619
Okay, I might need your advice on this,

04:18.620 --> 04:20.418
'cause there are 10 things in life

04:20.420 --> 04:21.869
that I'll only realize when I'm old.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.119
- Totally qualified.
- Yep, yep, okay.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.339
Firstly, fight for the thing
that means the most to you.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.349
Yep.

04:28.350 --> 04:29.529
- Agree?
- Yep.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.219
You were born for greatness,
believe in yourself.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.053
Oh, absolutely.

04:33.054 --> 04:34.275
Everyone's born for greatness.

04:34.276 --> 04:35.678
- I'm great, I'm great.
- You're great.

04:35.679 --> 04:37.039
- I think you're great.
- Thank you.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.119
- Stop.
- Go, next one.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.589
- All right, next one.
- Read it, read it.

04:39.590 --> 04:41.899
Do it your way, no regrets.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.569
Do everything with,
like, no consequence,

04:43.570 --> 04:44.610
and be like, "I'm glad I did it that way."

04:44.611 --> 04:45.749
Absolutely.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.369
Okay, sure, yes.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.203
- Yes?
- Yes.

04:48.203 --> 04:49.203
Yeah.

04:49.929 --> 04:51.029
What's the last one?

04:52.210 --> 04:53.260
Find your own path.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.320
Yeah.

04:56.090 --> 04:57.433
Yeah, find your own path.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.729
My path is gonna take me to

04:59.730 --> 05:01.109
the best pastries in the world.

05:01.110 --> 05:02.334
Mmm, sounds good.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.637
- France.
- Ohh.

05:03.638 --> 05:04.471
Gotta go to France first.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.293
No, this reminds me of work.

05:06.294 --> 05:08.929
I can't stop thinkin' about that big trip.

05:08.930 --> 05:10.059
What trip?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.919
Ah, it's our latest trip deal.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.626
We're pushin' on our fan page,
social media and everywhere.

05:15.627 --> 05:19.113
If that one doesn't take off
then Magic Wanderers is poof.

05:22.437 --> 05:25.136
Oh, yup, "Our most magical wander yet."

05:25.137 --> 05:28.323
"35 countries, all flights
and hostel stay included."

05:36.240 --> 05:37.499
Yeah, I still
can't believe I let Jono

05:37.500 --> 05:40.350
go out of town when it's such
a big weekend for the site.

05:42.370 --> 05:44.049
He and Beth, it's been three months

05:44.050 --> 05:44.969
and she's already movin' in.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.419
You think it's a little fast?

05:48.170 --> 05:49.717
Wow.

05:49.718 --> 05:50.718
Ah.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.449
Let's see, yellow, keep it mellow.

05:54.450 --> 05:55.963
If it's brown, flush it down.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.789
Savin' the planet one flush at a time.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.069
Oh, my God!

06:01.070 --> 06:01.903
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

06:01.903 --> 06:02.820
What? What?

06:02.821 --> 06:04.609
That blog, the sugar free recipe!

06:04.610 --> 06:07.219
It's been re-pinned 53 times.

06:07.220 --> 06:08.659
Get out of town.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.989
And it's got three
comments for me to approve.

06:10.990 --> 06:12.426
Okay, do it.

06:12.427 --> 06:13.839
I'm too nervous.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.959
- Come on, you can do it.
- You do it, you do it.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.099
Come on, you do it for me.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.749
Okay, all right.

06:17.750 --> 06:18.750
Okay.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.858
Uh, let's skip the first one.

06:21.859 --> 06:22.746
Why?

06:22.747 --> 06:24.289
What is it?

06:24.290 --> 06:27.069
This recipe looks like sweetened poo.

06:27.070 --> 06:28.266
Definitely canceled, okay.

06:28.267 --> 06:30.759
The second one's like
the thing for Viagra.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.019
It's a link I could use some day.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.219
Just keep it up there, no, no?

06:33.220 --> 06:34.679
Okay, all right.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.839
This last one is no big deal.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.206
It just says, "Your recipe rocks."

06:37.207 --> 06:39.066
"I tried it with my kids,

06:39.067 --> 06:41.866
"and they loved it despite the low sugar.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.523
"Thanks," three exclamation marks.

06:44.524 --> 06:47.679
Yes, you did, baby!

06:47.680 --> 06:50.739
Let me tell you, if a third
of your comments are good,

06:50.740 --> 06:52.389
you're an internet star.

06:52.390 --> 06:54.549
Have you thought about
that bakery cart idea?

06:54.550 --> 06:55.442
Not really.

06:55.443 --> 06:57.039
'Cause in Portland and San Francisco,

06:57.040 --> 06:58.123
it's a huge movement.

06:58.124 --> 07:00.269
I think you could be amazing
at here in New Zealand.

07:00.270 --> 07:01.869
You can make it happen.

07:01.870 --> 07:02.703
Maybe.

07:02.704 --> 07:04.189
Yeah, or in the meantime,

07:04.190 --> 07:05.979
you could teach me to bake today.

07:05.980 --> 07:06.813
- Okay.
- Yes?

07:06.814 --> 07:07.999
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.143
There's this recipe on
your site that's like,

07:12.430 --> 07:14.509
what, are you making wedding dresses?

07:14.510 --> 07:16.963
Is there a new subject, "Dear Blog,"

07:16.964 --> 07:18.369
- that I should know about?
- No.

07:18.370 --> 07:19.370
That's just my stupid cousin.

07:19.371 --> 07:21.399
She wants me to be a
bridesmaid at her wedding.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.309
Oh, well, that's not stupid, right?

07:23.310 --> 07:24.469
Well, she's like 21.

07:24.470 --> 07:25.999
Why is she getting married that young?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.849
I mean, did people in your generation

07:27.850 --> 07:28.683
get married that young?

07:28.684 --> 07:29.719
Oh, my generation?

07:29.720 --> 07:30.839
Oh, you mean like the Great Depression?

07:30.840 --> 07:31.810
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:31.811 --> 07:33.546
We had to sit together back then, so...

07:33.547 --> 07:35.539
No, seriously.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.679
Oh, well, there was this one girl.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.489
Her name was Jessica,

07:40.490 --> 07:43.479
and we dated for a little bit,

07:43.480 --> 07:46.069
and then we broke up right after school,

07:46.070 --> 07:48.119
and the first guy she went out with

07:48.120 --> 07:51.478
after that got her pregnant.

07:51.479 --> 07:52.312
Oh.

07:52.313 --> 07:54.559
Yeah, so she had kids right away.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.289
She must've had a very
boring sex life, then,

07:56.290 --> 07:57.869
with just the one guy.

07:57.870 --> 07:58.703
But at the same time, you know,

07:58.704 --> 08:00.589
if you're with one person for a long time,

08:00.590 --> 08:03.743
they can start to know all your
tricks and licks, you know?

08:04.660 --> 08:05.669
I remember this thing that she used

08:05.670 --> 08:07.079
to do to me in her basement.

08:07.080 --> 08:07.913
No, wait, hang on, hang on.

08:07.914 --> 08:11.199
We have a rule that we don't
go into detail about our exes.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
Okay.

08:14.359 --> 08:16.049
Are you jealous?

08:16.050 --> 08:16.883
No.

08:16.884 --> 08:17.907
You don't have to be jealous.

08:17.908 --> 08:19.969
There's nothing to threaten you here.

08:19.970 --> 08:21.669
'Cause if it really bothered you,

08:21.670 --> 08:23.149
one thing that we could do is

08:23.150 --> 08:27.721
I could just change my relationship status

08:27.722 --> 08:29.019
to be attached to Lizzie Conley.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.662
Are you serious?

08:30.663 --> 08:32.113
No.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.309
Oh, my God, why would you do that?

08:36.311 --> 08:37.991
No, I didn't do it.

08:37.993 --> 08:41.129
I did it, but it doesn't
count until you approve it.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.109
Well, the great thing
about our relationship

08:43.110 --> 08:44.859
is that we're free to be just us,

08:44.860 --> 08:46.269
just be honest and everything.

08:46.270 --> 08:48.049
Okay, yeah, of course, yeah.

08:48.050 --> 08:50.459
I mean, we have an honest, open thing.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.226
I don't want to, you know?

08:52.227 --> 08:54.029
- That's not who we are.
- No.

08:54.030 --> 08:55.809
We're free to do and be,

08:55.810 --> 08:57.539
and be and do who...

08:57.540 --> 08:59.109
Right, we're open, and...

08:59.110 --> 09:00.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.519
I mean, we don't have to
be like Ozzie and Harriet,

09:04.520 --> 09:06.909
Donna Reid, 1950s Nick
at Nite show, you know?

09:06.910 --> 09:08.409
Like your job is to make my dinner

09:08.410 --> 09:09.479
on time when we get home from work.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.539
Absolutely, and make sure
that you say grace at the table.

09:11.540 --> 09:14.119
Yes, everyone holding hands,
and then our 2.5 children...

09:14.120 --> 09:14.953
Playing Yahtzee.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.249
Playing Yahtzee at the end of the night,

09:16.250 --> 09:17.250
and goin' to bed.

09:18.039 --> 09:20.713
In separate beds.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.599
Thank you for that sexual intercourse.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.600
Oh, you're very welcome.

09:26.601 --> 09:28.829
I was pretending the whole time.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.639
At least now I have my sperm inside you,

09:30.640 --> 09:32.879
so that you can give me my third child.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.713
Aw, thank you, darling.

09:33.714 --> 09:35.603
You're such a loving provider.

09:37.390 --> 09:39.409
No white picket fence for us.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.867
Mm.

10:14.098 --> 10:15.185
Turn off the...

10:15.186 --> 10:17.374
Okay, 80%, this water.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.227
And energy.

10:24.850 --> 10:25.962
Hey, so I want to talk to you...

10:25.963 --> 10:29.259
I just wanted to say
that I'm totally okay

10:29.260 --> 10:32.376
with this whole no strings
attached thing, okay?

10:32.377 --> 10:35.429
I'm not gonna get obsessive or crazy.

10:35.430 --> 10:37.993
It's your path 100% of the way.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.180
Okay?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.229
Hey, so you know the deal on your site?

10:49.230 --> 10:50.909
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about work today.

10:50.910 --> 10:53.499
The thing is makin' me lose
more money and hair by the day.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.763
Yeah, but I'm thinking of taking it.

10:59.087 --> 11:02.317
Great.

11:02.318 --> 11:03.318
Great.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.699
No.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.183
No, no, it's great.

11:09.547 --> 11:10.833
Can you afford it?

11:12.719 --> 11:16.019
I don't know, I mean, I
can borrow from somebody.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.379
You know what, it's crazy.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.280
We don't have to talk about work.

11:18.281 --> 11:20.269
We don't need another potential
customer in the shower.

11:20.270 --> 11:21.270
It's okay.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.809
If you're gonna be on my show,

11:43.810 --> 11:45.599
you better not use a recipe book.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.659
Fine.

11:46.660 --> 11:47.650
- Fine.
- Fine.

11:47.650 --> 11:48.650
- Fine.
- Fine.

11:53.049 --> 11:54.489
Watch the pro, watch the pro.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.079
Stop moving it, just leave it.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.555
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Okay.

11:58.609 --> 11:59.848
Check this out.

11:59.849 --> 12:00.970
Oh, shit.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.925
- Oh, clearly.
- See?

12:02.926 --> 12:04.526
That's really
good, just one hand.

12:06.314 --> 12:08.922
This is like cake mix.

12:08.923 --> 12:09.756
- Okay.
- What did you do?

12:09.757 --> 12:11.220
- Is that bad?
- That's very bad.

12:13.693 --> 12:14.526
Ahh.

12:14.526 --> 12:15.359
Magic.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.989
And in the US they make
these silver dollar ones.

12:16.990 --> 12:18.319
I don't know if they do that here.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.070
Like pikelets.

12:20.071 --> 12:20.911
Pie clits?

12:20.912 --> 12:22.132
- Pikelets.
- Pie clits?

12:22.133 --> 12:23.732
They're like really small, Yeah.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.452
More, more, more,

12:25.453 --> 12:26.793
more, more, more...

12:26.794 --> 12:28.412
No, that's enough, that's
enough, that's enough.

12:28.413 --> 12:30.492
Oh, man.

12:30.493 --> 12:32.249
This is gonna make me kinda sick, huh?

12:32.250 --> 12:33.409
All right.

12:33.410 --> 12:34.410
Um,

12:35.620 --> 12:36.620
can we?

12:38.020 --> 12:39.892
No, I don't, I don't want,

12:39.893 --> 12:42.679
we were talking before
about the whole 50s thing,

12:42.680 --> 12:43.919
and it's ridiculous, right?

12:43.920 --> 12:46.879
But one thing that we
don't really ever do is,

12:46.880 --> 12:48.199
I don't really do enough,

12:48.200 --> 12:50.559
is give gratitude, you know?

12:50.560 --> 12:51.869
So, I just thought,

12:51.870 --> 12:53.919
but it's stupid, it's
stupid, let's just eat.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.559
No, wait, hang on, hang
on, hang on, hang on.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.119
I watched a Ted Talk where people

12:57.120 --> 12:59.070
who are grateful happen to live longer.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.683
Okay, yeah.

13:03.670 --> 13:04.909
Let's live longer.

13:04.910 --> 13:05.825
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.158
All right.

13:10.510 --> 13:12.123
Okay, uh,

13:13.330 --> 13:16.199
I'm grateful to be here at Ryan's house,

13:16.200 --> 13:18.059
which is swanky.

13:18.060 --> 13:19.424
Well, it's not really my house.

13:19.425 --> 13:20.779
It's more like Jono's house.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.660
- You still live here.
- Well, I just live here.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.879
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.199
Uh, I'm thankful to the universe

13:28.200 --> 13:30.899
for creating stars that blow up

13:30.900 --> 13:32.819
into different elements
and reassemble themselves

13:32.820 --> 13:35.963
into amazing pancakes with
the help of an amazing cook.

13:37.079 --> 13:39.943
I'm grateful to maple
syrup for being on sale.

13:41.760 --> 13:46.077
I'm grateful to maple
syrup trees in Canada

13:46.078 --> 13:48.219
that have survived
climate change long enough

13:48.220 --> 13:52.473
to stay cold enough to keep
making syrup for us forever.

13:54.110 --> 13:55.699
I'm grateful to fossil
fuels for bringing me

13:55.700 --> 13:58.050
cute American guys to
New Zealand to play with.

13:59.030 --> 14:01.529
And to Magic Wanders, uh, that exists

14:01.530 --> 14:04.109
because for the first
time in world history,

14:04.110 --> 14:08.379
people can truly wander at
will to pursue happiness

14:08.380 --> 14:09.913
in any way that they want.

14:12.830 --> 14:13.830
Amen?

14:14.753 --> 14:16.079
It looks amazing, isn't it?

14:16.080 --> 14:17.639
It's so good, mm-hmm.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.299
It is gorgeous.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.589
Oh, I know what we can do.

14:20.590 --> 14:23.039
We can go over and start
off in Enigma, right?

14:23.040 --> 14:25.089
And then slowly go up Mount Vick.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.903
Please untag me from the photo.

14:28.993 --> 14:29.993
Okay.

14:31.153 --> 14:33.589
I just don't want my
colleagues and stuff...

14:33.590 --> 14:34.619
No, no, I wouldn't want you

14:34.620 --> 14:35.829
to stop dating your colleagues,

14:35.830 --> 14:37.669
or have the option at least to...

14:37.670 --> 14:38.640
No.

14:38.641 --> 14:40.019
No, it's okay, it's okay.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.402
Also, Tinder is an option for you as well.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.609
It's still on your phone. Yeah.

14:44.610 --> 14:46.683
I should get rid of it eventually.

14:47.650 --> 14:48.650
Did you?

14:49.830 --> 14:51.149
Oh, no, it's probably still

14:51.150 --> 14:52.439
maybe in the back of my phone somewhere.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.159
I think I have it, like,
inside of a folder of a folder.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.710
I can do a search for it, but...

14:59.609 --> 15:02.189
I just think online's just,

15:02.190 --> 15:03.639
try and keep things private sometimes.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.237
You don't have to tell
everybody everything.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.979
Ooh, your college friend, Angie,

15:10.980 --> 15:15.249
oh, speak of the devil,
is liking my photos.

15:15.250 --> 15:16.989
She thinks I'm sexy.

15:16.990 --> 15:18.767
That's not the word she used for me.

15:19.601 --> 15:20.440
She's stalking both of us.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.299
I think you two are meant
to be together, basically.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.300
Maybe.

15:26.678 --> 15:27.678
I'll tell you what.

15:29.397 --> 15:31.085
Are you snapping her?

15:31.086 --> 15:31.958
Yeah.

15:31.959 --> 15:33.219
Snapchatting or whatever?

15:33.220 --> 15:34.719
That's amateur.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.089
Phone sex.

15:36.090 --> 15:38.549
Now that is a lost art.

15:38.550 --> 15:40.129
- What are you doing?
- Calling Angie.

15:40.130 --> 15:41.187
Oh, my God, no you're not.

15:41.188 --> 15:42.365
Yes.

15:42.366 --> 15:43.199
No, no, no!

15:43.200 --> 15:44.359
Wait, wait, it's ringing.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.984
- It's okay.
- Are you serious?

15:45.985 --> 15:48.288
No, no, no, no, no, no!

15:48.289 --> 15:50.609
Wait, wait, hang on, hang on, hang on!

15:50.610 --> 15:52.039
It's still ringing, let her pick up.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
Stop, come on.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.699
That's crossing the line.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.199
What's wrong with a little analog love?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.819
I don't even know what that is.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.851
Oh, really?

16:07.822 --> 16:08.822
Mmm.

16:14.681 --> 16:16.789
Oh, we never had sex up here.

16:16.790 --> 16:17.809
Let's do it.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.643
No, we don't...

16:18.644 --> 16:20.164
Tell you what, tell you what, hang on.

16:21.411 --> 16:22.244
Okay.

16:22.245 --> 16:23.849
Let's make it like a sexercise thing.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.979
I'm gonna be like the girl
from Midnight Espresso, okay,

16:25.980 --> 16:26.970
'cause I know you like her,

16:26.971 --> 16:28.329
and you'll be like thrusting this way,

16:28.330 --> 16:29.636
and then I'm gonna be up this way,

16:29.637 --> 16:31.963
and yeah, it'll be like
two birds with one stone.

16:33.550 --> 16:34.550
No.

16:35.380 --> 16:36.213
Let me tell you something.

16:36.214 --> 16:37.975
I have a confession to make, okay?

16:37.976 --> 16:39.606
No, no, no, it's okay, you
don't have to tell me anything.

16:39.607 --> 16:40.470
No, I do.

16:40.471 --> 16:41.509
I got to let you know.

16:41.510 --> 16:45.353
You're not just like a body to me.

16:47.790 --> 16:48.790
Yeah?

16:51.860 --> 16:52.860
I love you.

17:07.056 --> 17:08.056
Yay.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.267
I don't know, Mum, just busy.

17:25.153 --> 17:27.821
I'm not comparing my life
to old uni friends, okay?

17:33.020 --> 17:35.170
Nothing, I'm just super
stressed right now.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.110
Yeah, he just got back from the U.S.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.729
Hey, Mummy, I got to go.

18:45.730 --> 18:47.519
Okay, we'll talk some more soon.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.969
Okay, bye.

18:48.970 --> 18:50.173
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.940
Keep using my laptop if you wanna.

18:53.786 --> 18:54.786
Okay.

18:55.590 --> 18:56.590
Ah,

18:58.604 --> 19:00.669
I've been thinkin' about the trip.

19:00.670 --> 19:01.610
Yeah, me, too.

19:01.611 --> 19:02.999
Okay, all right.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.039
So, if you're thinking about the trip,

19:04.040 --> 19:05.229
I'm thinking about the trip,

19:05.230 --> 19:07.299
I was thinking that maybe
instead of going out

19:07.300 --> 19:10.309
for lunch or something like that,

19:10.310 --> 19:14.029
maybe I could help
figure it out, you know?

19:14.030 --> 19:15.529
'Cause I wanna be of some kind of use.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.969
I know that I can't do anything

19:16.970 --> 19:18.849
on the Magic Wanders end of it.

19:18.850 --> 19:19.959
I mean, it's a one time deal,

19:19.960 --> 19:22.609
but I can help you talk
it out, you know, or...

19:22.610 --> 19:24.760
But it's not just
about the trip, though.

19:25.810 --> 19:28.989
Yeah, I mean, you've got
the bakery cart options

19:28.990 --> 19:30.509
and everything like
that, I totally get it,

19:30.510 --> 19:33.573
but I just figured if you take that trip,

19:35.380 --> 19:37.180
this could be our last day together.

19:38.580 --> 19:39.580
Yeah?

19:43.970 --> 19:46.019
Okay, let's do it.

19:46.020 --> 19:46.853
Let's do it.

19:46.853 --> 19:47.686
Yeah.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.579
We're gonna have a hot lava
moat around the house, okay?

19:50.580 --> 19:51.413
- Okay.
- We're locked in.

19:51.414 --> 19:52.668
We can't leave.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.228
- Just you and me.
- Just us.

19:54.229 --> 19:55.629
Okay.

19:55.630 --> 19:56.630
Uh,

19:57.710 --> 19:58.710
what do we do?

19:59.949 --> 20:00.949
I have no idea.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.579
A list.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.289
Probably start with Vegas.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.473
Vegas? Okay, cool.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.248
Uh, parkour.

20:11.249 --> 20:12.749
- Parkore, like...
- No, I'm just kidding.

20:12.750 --> 20:13.583
No, I want you to do it.

20:13.584 --> 20:15.223
- Build a home.
- Okay.

20:16.170 --> 20:17.150
Get in shape.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.083
Get in shape.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.060
Everybody wants to get in shape, right?

20:19.061 --> 20:20.419
Mm-hmm.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.360
Learn an instrument.

20:21.361 --> 20:22.929
On top of that, learn a language.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.929
Um, open a bakery.

20:24.930 --> 20:26.529
Yeah, awesome.

20:26.530 --> 20:27.569
Karate champion.

20:27.570 --> 20:29.309
I used to be a brown belt in high school.

20:29.310 --> 20:31.089
- What?
- Join the circus.

20:31.090 --> 20:32.649
Yes. Yes.

20:32.650 --> 20:34.049
Oh, make a web series.

20:34.050 --> 20:35.159
Use my degree?

20:35.160 --> 20:36.749
Use your degree in...

20:36.750 --> 20:38.719
- Philosophy.
- Philosophy.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.139
That's a little, yes,
you will find a way.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.249
Every day, you're using it.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.181
- Yeah, no?
- Yeah.

20:43.182 --> 20:45.509
Okay.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.229
Oh, you've been tagged.

20:47.230 --> 20:48.469
It's your sister and nephews.

20:48.470 --> 20:49.920
I know, yeah, they're cute.

20:51.213 --> 20:52.080
It says your dad tagged you,

20:52.081 --> 20:53.870
but you're not in it.

20:54.731 --> 20:55.942
Ah.

20:55.943 --> 20:56.943
Yeah.

20:58.570 --> 21:01.092
What else? Uh, long term stuff.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.999
I'd like to pay off my student loans.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.972
Maybe have a family?

21:04.973 --> 21:06.113
Have a family? Sure.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.320
What else?

21:09.270 --> 21:10.320
White picket fence?

21:13.790 --> 21:15.240
What do you think about that?

21:19.393 --> 21:20.393
And

21:21.300 --> 21:23.359
what about, like, romance?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.860
I mean, you got your whole
life ahead of you here.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.139
At least...

21:28.140 --> 21:29.517
- I dunno.
- Somethin'.

21:30.730 --> 21:32.349
Like, it might be weird,
but just to be honest

21:32.350 --> 21:34.773
about the list, we'll just put this here.

21:35.731 --> 21:36.564
There we go.

21:36.565 --> 21:37.693
Just an idea.

21:39.220 --> 21:40.220
Yeah?

21:42.240 --> 21:43.240
Okay.

21:44.850 --> 21:45.850
Shall we?

21:53.830 --> 21:54.720
That's a lot of stuff.

21:54.721 --> 21:56.220
Yeah, that's a lot of stuff.

22:00.700 --> 22:01.700
But we could do it.

22:03.450 --> 22:04.450
Today.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.439
Reverse strip blackjack.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.949
Look at this, we got
clothes everywhere, right?

22:25.950 --> 22:28.650
I mean, half of this is
Beth's, and the rest is Paris.

22:30.260 --> 22:33.841
Whoever loses, has to put on a layer.

22:33.842 --> 22:35.451
- Hit.
- Boom, you lose!

22:35.452 --> 22:38.590
Why did you hit on 19?

22:38.591 --> 22:40.508
Aww, come on, bust you.

22:41.572 --> 22:44.822
Very nice.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.709
Business underneath, and butch,

22:54.710 --> 22:55.562
maybe not so much...

22:55.562 --> 22:56.420
With the kitty cat.

22:56.421 --> 22:58.649
That's a different kind of butch.

23:01.396 --> 23:02.725
Getting a little sweaty in there, huh?

23:02.726 --> 23:03.570
It's all right.

23:03.571 --> 23:05.129
Maybe gambling isn't your thing.

23:05.130 --> 23:07.289
Maybe like a Grand Canyon in the US trip

23:07.290 --> 23:09.209
would be your best bet?

23:09.210 --> 23:10.649
What about you, you've
moved to Wellington.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.279
You got your start up and
you could lose it any minute.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.599
Yeah, but, I dunno,
it was just kinda time

23:16.600 --> 23:18.109
to be an adult, you know?

23:18.110 --> 23:21.209
I wanted to make something of myself.

23:21.210 --> 23:23.669
You got to take a risk
sometimes to get what you want.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.669
I get the whole bakery thing,
I wanna do the bakery thing,

23:25.670 --> 23:27.751
but travel...

23:27.752 --> 23:30.153
Yeah, and don't let anybody
hold you back from that.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.805
I was dating this girl in
San Francisco, and she...

23:34.806 --> 23:37.409
Hang on, hang on, we
have a rule, remember?

23:37.410 --> 23:38.885
Oh, yeah, okay.

23:42.060 --> 23:43.429
You know what? Sod it.

23:43.430 --> 23:44.430
Tell me the story.

23:45.450 --> 23:46.283
You sawed it?

23:46.284 --> 23:47.589
Sod, S-O-D.

23:47.590 --> 23:48.423
S-O-D, sod it.

23:48.423 --> 23:49.410
Just put grass on it.

23:49.411 --> 23:50.761
Which means...
Screw it, like screw it.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.595
Cool.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.679
Okay, 'cause it's kind of a
stupid rule anyway, right?

23:54.680 --> 23:57.669
Yeah, so this girl, uh,

23:57.670 --> 23:59.999
she was obsessed with painting,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.969
and I thought she was amazingly talented.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.279
And she just had this dream, you know,

24:03.280 --> 24:05.269
like to get away from her crazy mother,

24:05.270 --> 24:08.749
and her little small town
life, and do something.

24:08.750 --> 24:13.119
And I tried to help her in any
way that I could, you know.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.699
I was like trying to
sign her up for classes,

24:15.700 --> 24:16.700
and she wouldn't go,

24:16.701 --> 24:19.209
and I was trying to take
her to art galleries,

24:19.210 --> 24:20.043
and she wouldn't go,

24:20.044 --> 24:22.189
and so finally I just, like,

24:22.190 --> 24:25.109
I had to leave her just
to give her her space

24:25.110 --> 24:27.773
so she could be who she wanted to be.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.669
And I went traveling.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.009
And I went Calcutta, and it blew my mind,

24:33.010 --> 24:35.440
and I went to Tokyo, and it blew my mind,

24:35.441 --> 24:38.297
and I went to Sri Lanka,
and it blew my mind.

24:38.298 --> 24:40.799
And I kept get getting
higher, higher, higher

24:40.800 --> 24:42.139
until my head exploded,

24:42.140 --> 24:44.619
and it was one of the best explosions,

24:44.620 --> 24:48.397
second best explosion, ever.

24:49.380 --> 24:50.549
- Hit?
- Yes.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.596
- Are you sure you wanna hit?
- I'm gonna win this.

24:54.264 --> 24:56.377
You're so busted!

24:56.378 --> 24:59.295
So easy!

25:04.266 --> 25:06.266
You know I was just
kidding about Parkour, right?

25:07.410 --> 25:10.356
Sometimes our greatest
dreams are kidded first.

25:10.357 --> 25:12.563
And two, and three, and...

25:17.502 --> 25:18.502
It's easy!

25:24.070 --> 25:24.909
Remember to breathe.

25:24.910 --> 25:27.159
Are my buns steel-ifying?

25:34.211 --> 25:36.469
Feel that burn!

25:36.470 --> 25:37.749
My tempo, my tempo!

25:37.750 --> 25:38.909
My tempo, my tempo,

25:38.910 --> 25:41.327
my tempo, my tempo, my tempo!

25:44.092 --> 25:45.137
Come on, no.

25:45.138 --> 25:46.976
You're looking at me like
that's an impossible move

25:46.977 --> 25:47.840
or something like that.

25:47.841 --> 25:49.033
Anybody can do that.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.163
That's not what I meant.

25:51.164 --> 25:52.189
Nobody can do,

25:52.190 --> 25:53.379
very few people.

25:53.380 --> 25:55.029
There's only one per, there's two.

25:55.030 --> 25:57.193
You're amazing in every way.

26:07.510 --> 26:08.810
- Maori language.
- Maori.

26:08.811 --> 26:10.257
Okay, oh, yeah, bro.

26:10.258 --> 26:11.399
Let's go.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.429
- No.
- That sounds right.

26:12.430 --> 26:13.727
Doesn't that sound good?

26:13.728 --> 26:14.969
Is that, is that racist?

26:14.970 --> 26:15.950
Is that bad?

26:15.951 --> 26:16.988
That's pretty bad.

26:21.990 --> 26:23.627
You know what? I got this.

26:23.628 --> 26:25.239
I can do it, okay, I don't need this.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.559
Uh,

26:26.560 --> 26:27.847
all righty.

26:27.848 --> 26:28.931
Here we go.

26:39.630 --> 26:41.010
Ahh!

26:41.011 --> 26:43.159
That was fucking awesome.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.259
I'm gonna email this to you, okay?

26:44.260 --> 26:46.959
You can post it and send
it to everybody you know.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.733
It's all right, you can tag me.

26:52.856 --> 26:54.715
I'm gonna do it again.

26:55.550 --> 26:57.057
Yeah.

27:08.230 --> 27:10.096
If you can get one more
sheet from down there,

27:10.097 --> 27:12.409
and we'll just cover it up at the top.

27:12.410 --> 27:13.889
Take this,

27:13.890 --> 27:15.484
this...

27:15.485 --> 27:17.293
- This right here.
- Ahh!

27:17.294 --> 27:18.364
- Like this?
- No.

27:18.365 --> 27:19.294
- Like this?
- No.

27:19.294 --> 27:20.165
- Like this?
- No!

27:20.165 --> 27:20.998
Like this?

27:20.999 --> 27:22.362
Oh, your McMansion is killing me!

27:22.363 --> 27:26.043
It's my house, eco boy!

27:27.910 --> 27:29.569
So how can I be more useful here?

27:29.570 --> 27:31.709
Okay, you can go make us some tea.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.964
I'm American, I don't
know how to make tea.

27:34.860 --> 27:35.860
Well done.

27:37.150 --> 27:38.719
Is this earthquake proof, though?

27:38.720 --> 27:39.974
- Oh, totally.
- Okay.

27:39.975 --> 27:40.808
Totally.

27:40.809 --> 27:42.289
I am seriously impressed.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.629
It could use some art, though, you know?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.839
Well, what about that painter girl?

27:46.840 --> 27:48.609
She's busy, trust me.

27:48.610 --> 27:49.929
How do you know?

27:49.930 --> 27:52.489
All right, so I was
traveling for like three months

27:52.490 --> 27:53.549
after we broke up, right,

27:53.550 --> 27:55.429
and I'm getting a little
bit lonely on the road.

27:55.430 --> 27:58.699
And so at an internet cafe in Ghana,

27:58.700 --> 28:01.409
I Facebook stalk her, right?

28:01.410 --> 28:04.869
I look on her profile, and
her picture is just just her

28:04.870 --> 28:07.809
but it's also this guy
with his arm around her,

28:07.810 --> 28:09.309
and looks nothing like me,

28:09.310 --> 28:11.363
but looks a lot like her dad.

28:12.383 --> 28:14.059
It was a little weird before I realized

28:14.060 --> 28:16.129
that actually this guy also lives

28:16.130 --> 28:18.599
in the same small town that
she was trying to escape from.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.469
I find out from my mom
a couple months later

28:20.470 --> 28:22.259
that she's engaged,

28:22.260 --> 28:24.959
and I find out from my mom a
couple months later after that

28:24.960 --> 28:26.049
that they're married,

28:26.050 --> 28:29.557
and a couple months after
that, nuclear family, you know?

28:30.434 --> 28:31.434
I didn't ask.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.599
It must be kinda nice to
have some sort of stability.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.829
You know, have a nice house,

28:36.830 --> 28:39.113
and maybe a trampoline in the backyard.

28:40.205 --> 28:41.205
Yeah.

28:42.740 --> 28:44.929
I mean, did she ever paint again?

28:44.930 --> 28:47.859
I checked the fan page that I made her,

28:47.860 --> 28:50.079
there wasn't another post.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.019
Twitter, Instagram, same thing.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.099
And I googled everywhere to see if she'd

28:54.100 --> 28:55.409
done anything with her life at that point,

28:55.410 --> 28:58.043
but, like, no painting.

29:00.490 --> 29:01.840
Uh, but don't read into it.

29:02.910 --> 29:04.153
You know, it's...

29:12.400 --> 29:13.759
Bakery is next.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.139
Uh, let's go to the kitchen.

29:15.140 --> 29:15.973
Let's do...

29:15.973 --> 29:16.973
Can we skip this one?

29:18.170 --> 29:19.199
Yeah.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.090
Yeah, okay, yeah.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.483
Uh, then,

29:22.565 --> 29:23.565
yeah.

29:25.006 --> 29:26.006
Yeah.

29:49.961 --> 29:54.491
What was that?

29:54.492 --> 29:56.033
Oh!

29:59.143 --> 30:02.153
You almost burnt my face
on the hot lava line.

30:02.154 --> 30:03.829
And you don't care, all right.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.530
You were clearly the school bully.

30:07.361 --> 30:09.329
When's the last time
you said you did this?

30:09.330 --> 30:11.041
I was 17.

30:11.042 --> 30:11.890
I was gonna quit earlier,

30:11.891 --> 30:14.273
but there was this cute
guy in class, Ethan.

30:14.274 --> 30:15.107
Oh, okay.

30:15.108 --> 30:17.129
Cool, it's worth gettin' violent

30:17.130 --> 30:19.029
for an Ethan, right?

30:19.030 --> 30:20.409
Yeah, he went to a
different high school,

30:20.410 --> 30:22.652
and he had dreams, kind
of like your painter girl,

30:22.653 --> 30:24.839
except, you know, he went for his dreams.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.819
He got into this prestigious
music school in Vienna.

30:27.820 --> 30:28.680
Okay.

30:28.681 --> 30:30.699
And, you know, I thought I loved him,

30:30.700 --> 30:33.810
so I was young, I let him go, you know.

30:35.150 --> 30:37.079
But I looked him on
Facebook four years later,

30:37.080 --> 30:39.559
and turns out the last post he ever made

30:39.560 --> 30:40.769
was three years before that.

30:40.770 --> 30:42.899
Ahh, okay, so he either ended up being

30:42.900 --> 30:45.049
a failed musician,

30:45.050 --> 30:47.189
or he turned out to be so successful

30:47.190 --> 30:48.979
that he's like fuck social media,

30:48.980 --> 30:51.739
I'm just gonna be my true artist self.

30:51.740 --> 30:52.940
Actually, he was dead.

30:55.190 --> 30:57.469
About six months after he moved,

30:57.470 --> 31:00.399
he was crossing the street
and got hit by a car.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.169
That's fuckin' terrible.

31:02.170 --> 31:04.379
Look, it was three years ago,

31:04.380 --> 31:07.089
and we dated seven years ago, but...

31:07.090 --> 31:08.509
- Do you wanna just...
- What?

31:08.510 --> 31:09.887
It seems like a weird...

31:11.431 --> 31:13.478
What, what are you doing?

31:16.220 --> 31:17.220
Okay.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.729
Actually, it was kind of
alleviated by the fact

31:20.730 --> 31:23.589
that it was a memorial tribute
from his Austrian girlfriend

31:23.590 --> 31:25.440
who he had been dating for two years.

31:27.640 --> 31:28.873
Wait, like two years.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.709
She was an exchange
student at his high school.

31:34.710 --> 31:37.199
He'd been seeing me
and her at the same time.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.209
I think she was probably the reason

31:38.210 --> 31:39.453
why he moved to Vienna.

31:41.778 --> 31:42.785
That's fuckin' awful.

31:44.940 --> 31:46.599
Seriously.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.530
Come on, get up.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.530
Got one more move.

31:56.159 --> 31:58.076
The hell are you doing?

31:59.370 --> 32:01.139
All right, if you don't know
what that is, then you win.

32:01.140 --> 32:02.549
You win.

32:02.550 --> 32:04.122
No, no, no, hey, I'm kidding.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.249
It's the Karate Kid.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.250
Thank you.

32:08.738 --> 32:10.486
With Jane Smith.

32:10.487 --> 32:11.606
I'll ring your...

32:25.298 --> 32:28.832
It's like so easy in the YouTubes.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.817
Yes, yes, yes!

32:30.818 --> 32:32.187
- No!
- Yes, no, yes!

32:33.640 --> 32:35.179
Ready, circus superstar?

32:35.180 --> 32:37.799
I'm ready to be the star attraction.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.406
One,

32:39.407 --> 32:40.849
two,

32:40.850 --> 32:41.850
three.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.206
Wait!

32:45.111 --> 32:46.193
You're Superwoman!

32:47.620 --> 32:49.135
What's it like up there?

32:49.136 --> 32:53.928
Feels amazing!

32:56.868 --> 32:58.496
Oh, oh! Oof!

33:00.478 --> 33:01.902
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

33:01.903 --> 33:03.070
You're okay.

33:05.227 --> 33:06.489
Ahh.

33:06.490 --> 33:07.854
It's a short career.

33:34.436 --> 33:35.475
Ow.

33:38.785 --> 33:40.554
You havin' a good time today?

33:40.555 --> 33:41.804
Yeah, I'm having a great time.

33:41.805 --> 33:42.849
Good.

33:42.850 --> 33:44.569
So we're good then, right?

33:44.570 --> 33:46.259
We're doin' pretty good, you and me.

33:46.260 --> 33:47.260
- Mm.
- Mm.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.300
Do you believe in polyamory?

33:52.310 --> 33:55.309
Uh, isn't that officially what we have?

33:55.310 --> 33:56.619
Um, we're not really official.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.199
Well, it's like technical, I mean...

33:58.200 --> 33:59.655
Are you dating anyone else?

33:59.656 --> 34:01.114
Not that I know of.

34:02.580 --> 34:04.189
Last time I checked, you
were lying next to me

34:04.190 --> 34:06.609
like six to seven nights a week.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.775
Are you dating anyone
while I'm sleeping or...

34:08.775 --> 34:09.706
Obviously I'm not.

34:09.708 --> 34:10.748
Okay, good.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.759
All I'm saying that maybe what I had

34:12.760 --> 34:14.453
with Ethan was polyamory.

34:16.254 --> 34:17.539
Well, it woulda been cool,

34:17.540 --> 34:18.931
but it would be nice
to have known about it.

34:18.933 --> 34:20.864
Yeah.

34:20.866 --> 34:21.886
Sounds like a cool idea.

34:21.887 --> 34:23.257
I think that's a prerequisite.

34:25.909 --> 34:27.199
I don't think, honestly,
at the end of the day,

34:27.199 --> 34:29.033
people can share much of anything.

34:29.975 --> 34:31.549
What do you mean?

34:31.550 --> 34:36.299
Well, all right, so I went
to this commune in Spain

34:36.300 --> 34:39.629
where they literally did
share everything, yeah?

34:39.630 --> 34:40.570
One of those intentional communities,

34:40.571 --> 34:43.289
and you share money and resources, and...

34:43.290 --> 34:44.123
Yeah.

34:44.123 --> 34:44.956
Why is that bad for you?

34:44.956 --> 34:47.409
I mean, it's all about
sustainability, right?

34:47.409 --> 34:50.081
Yeah, no, I didn't even
know what sustainability was.

34:50.081 --> 34:51.369
Until like three months ago,

34:51.370 --> 34:53.518
and I'm just saying that,
like, they lost a lot of people

34:53.520 --> 34:55.168
because they couldn't hold onto 'em.

34:55.170 --> 34:57.629
Everybody wanted their
own stuff, you know?

34:57.630 --> 35:01.219
And in this day and age where
everything's about, you know,

35:01.220 --> 35:04.969
the white picket fence and
keeping up with the Joneses,

35:04.970 --> 35:07.799
there was this gal, her name was Indigo,

35:07.800 --> 35:09.129
and she was my host.

35:09.130 --> 35:12.729
And at community dinners, we
would sit next to each other,

35:12.730 --> 35:15.499
and her leg was like
rubbing up against my leg,

35:15.500 --> 35:17.629
and I don't know, but she told me

35:17.630 --> 35:19.889
that I should meet her at
this building along the creek.

35:19.890 --> 35:22.439
So that night, I go and
I walk along the creek,

35:22.440 --> 35:24.716
and there are signs there that say,

35:24.717 --> 35:27.194
"This way, Love Hut number seven."

35:28.029 --> 35:30.159
So I'm like, okay.

35:30.160 --> 35:35.160
So I get there, and there's
this guy waiting for me,

35:36.840 --> 35:40.533
and he introduces himself
as Indigo's husband.

35:41.595 --> 35:43.379
- Yeah.
- What?

35:43.380 --> 35:45.659
And he's simply there with
a big bright smile on his face

35:45.660 --> 35:49.433
giving me instructions on
exactly how to please his wife.

35:50.420 --> 35:51.839
Because when I say they shared everything,

35:51.840 --> 35:54.773
I mean, they literally,
like, shared everything?

35:55.680 --> 35:57.829
Did you go through with it?

35:57.830 --> 35:59.011
Yeah.

35:59.012 --> 36:01.149
I mean, you know, like social obligation.

36:01.150 --> 36:02.550
And he gave me instructions.

36:03.660 --> 36:04.580
I just think at the end of the day,

36:04.581 --> 36:06.189
it's not good for the kids.

36:06.190 --> 36:07.209
Maybe it is good for those kids,

36:07.210 --> 36:08.889
but I grew up in a world where it's like

36:08.890 --> 36:10.409
one man, one woman,

36:10.410 --> 36:12.979
or I guess now it could be two
women or two men, you know.

36:12.980 --> 36:15.409
But they're in a committed relationship.

36:15.410 --> 36:16.330
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:16.331 --> 36:18.469
And Anything else kind of feels

36:18.470 --> 36:20.301
like they're lying to themselves.

36:20.302 --> 36:21.450
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:21.451 --> 36:22.330
I don't think I could be with a guy

36:22.331 --> 36:24.059
who's lying to himself anyway.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.060
Yeah.

37:01.589 --> 37:02.689
I want something viral.

37:02.690 --> 37:04.408
Something viral and edgy.

37:04.409 --> 37:05.409
What's edgy?

37:06.580 --> 37:07.949
The licking.

37:07.950 --> 37:10.209
Oh, like sexy licking?

37:10.210 --> 37:11.409
- Yeah?
- It's different!

37:11.410 --> 37:12.243
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

37:12.244 --> 37:14.339
Yes, edgy, safe for work.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.279
Uh, good for kids but not really.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.130
No, no, yeah, yeah, that's brilliant.

37:20.090 --> 37:21.046
I'm gonna take it off.
You ready?

37:21.047 --> 37:23.546
I'm gonna leave it on, okay.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.799
Oh my God, I've already got two likes

37:34.800 --> 37:36.402
on that Facebook video.

37:37.390 --> 37:38.380
Two, that's absolutely viral.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.099
Yeah, like 10 people
catch measles or something,

37:40.100 --> 37:41.740
then, yeah, that's like a virus.

37:41.741 --> 37:43.199
You win.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.639
Three comments.

37:44.640 --> 37:48.169
The first one says, "Lizzie
has started a meme!"

37:48.170 --> 37:49.610
There is no higher compliment.

37:49.611 --> 37:50.540
I know.

37:50.541 --> 37:52.296
Um, second one says,
"You should totally do it"

37:52.297 --> 37:53.297
"gonzo style."

37:54.220 --> 37:55.869
What's that, is he
referring to the Muppet?

37:55.870 --> 37:57.559
Like throw some chickens
at 'em or something,

37:57.560 --> 37:59.389
but I think it means more like attack,

37:59.390 --> 38:01.323
like in-your-face type thing?

38:03.772 --> 38:05.359
Oh okay, the little cartoon pizza guy,

38:05.360 --> 38:06.559
it says he's around the corner.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.419
This is exactly like one
of those pornos, actually.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.309
You know like where the guy
shows up with the pizza.

38:11.310 --> 38:12.739
They're like, oh, I don't
have enough money to pay,

38:12.740 --> 38:14.070
- and you...
- Yeah.

38:14.071 --> 38:15.291
You haven't seen it, you're too young.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.239
I have seen it, I have seen it.

38:17.240 --> 38:18.240
It's vintage porn!

38:18.241 --> 38:20.899
You know what? No, I've got a better idea.

38:20.900 --> 38:21.733
He's here.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.049
He's gonna enter the door,
and I'm gonna try and get,

38:23.050 --> 38:24.979
you know, all sexy like
to get him to try and...

38:24.980 --> 38:26.302
Yeah, but we already said that.

38:26.303 --> 38:27.579
And you got to keep recording, okay?

38:27.580 --> 38:29.029
But he's gonna eat it, not me.

38:29.030 --> 38:30.849
We already did the plan, let's just go.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.007
No, why does everything have to be

38:32.008 --> 38:33.067
according to what you wanna do?

38:33.068 --> 38:35.409
Not everything has to be
according to your plan.

38:35.410 --> 38:36.739
Okay? Just follow along.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.006
Just record, and I'll do everything, okay?

38:39.007 --> 38:39.908
- Okay.
- Okay?

38:39.908 --> 38:40.847
- Okay.
- Ready?

38:40.848 --> 38:42.347
All right, yeah.

38:44.817 --> 38:45.777
Hey.

38:45.778 --> 38:47.086
Hey, Hell Pizza, how you goin'?

38:47.087 --> 38:48.939
Got a large cheese, large 'lux,

38:48.940 --> 38:50.333
and a salad for you guys.

38:52.770 --> 38:54.189
What's with the camera?

38:54.190 --> 38:56.934
Uh, we're doing a
documentary on pizza delivery.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.180
Blake?

39:00.724 --> 39:01.724
Do I know you?

39:04.790 --> 39:06.840
Blake's the guy I lost my virginity to.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.209
Yup, we got drunk at a party,

39:10.210 --> 39:12.319
and we just did it on the bathroom floor,

39:12.320 --> 39:14.243
and you got up and took off.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.760
Uh...

39:16.760 --> 39:17.593
No?

39:17.594 --> 39:19.099
You don't remember me,
you don't recognize me?

39:19.100 --> 39:20.100
No.

39:21.116 --> 39:22.030
Dude?

39:22.031 --> 39:24.569
I sent you this naked picture of myself.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.789
Next thing I know, it
gets emailed back to me

39:25.790 --> 39:27.399
by all my friends.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.129
I heard that you were going
around bragging to everybody

39:29.130 --> 39:31.169
how you banged this random slut.

39:31.170 --> 39:32.439
Well, I used to drink a lot of piss

39:32.440 --> 39:33.420
and do a lot of dumb shit,

39:33.421 --> 39:35.983
but can't apologize to everyone.

39:39.300 --> 39:40.419
Just, just,

39:40.420 --> 39:42.149
we're gonna pay for the pizza.

39:42.150 --> 39:43.150
How much is it?

39:43.985 --> 39:45.053
39.50.

40:00.140 --> 40:01.140
Hey.

40:06.110 --> 40:07.229
I'm really sorry back there.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.580
I shoulda stood up for you.

40:09.687 --> 40:11.786
I wanted to, you know, but...

40:11.787 --> 40:13.603
Okay, it was my fault.

40:14.606 --> 40:15.736
It's not your fault.

40:15.737 --> 40:18.779
That guy's a douchebag, you know?

40:18.780 --> 40:21.529
And we're living in a world where people

40:21.530 --> 40:24.239
send random naked pictures to people,

40:24.240 --> 40:25.459
you know, that they barely know.

40:25.460 --> 40:28.399
I mean, it's, it's the age.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.566
Yeah?

40:29.567 --> 40:32.482
Yeah, well, you've caught up
pretty quickly, haven't you?

40:32.483 --> 40:33.889
I mean, what's the difference?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.396
We're taking pictures now.

40:35.397 --> 40:38.143
I don't know if I can trust
you with these pictures.

40:40.290 --> 40:41.290
Are you serious?

40:42.770 --> 40:44.470
It's 'cause I fuckin' respect you.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.240
I love you.

40:49.565 --> 40:50.565
And you love me.

40:51.540 --> 40:52.540
Right?

40:54.660 --> 40:55.660
I love you.

41:09.436 --> 41:11.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.463
Oh, hey, shh.

41:13.400 --> 41:14.400
Jeez!

41:15.456 --> 41:18.579
This is, it's just my
great grandmother's ring.

41:18.580 --> 41:22.384
I'm just supposed to use it on someone,

41:22.385 --> 41:25.909
I'm just supposed
to be able to use it with,

41:25.910 --> 41:29.740
I just want some kind
of commitment, you know.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.299
Like any kind, really.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.119
We can go Facebook official.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.570
I don't wanna feel trapped.

41:38.680 --> 41:39.610
Yeah.

41:39.610 --> 41:40.443
Yeah, yeah.

41:40.444 --> 41:42.450
Yeah, that's, that's fine.

41:43.550 --> 41:44.440
I get it.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.360
Yeah, that's okay.

41:45.361 --> 41:46.410
- That's good.
- Ryan.

41:47.290 --> 41:48.263
Ryan!

41:48.264 --> 41:50.039
I didn't mean what I meant, okay?

41:50.040 --> 41:51.499
Whatever we've had, it's been great,

41:51.500 --> 41:53.719
and I don't see why we have to start

41:53.720 --> 41:55.299
labeling things now, right?

41:55.300 --> 41:58.609
I mean, we're happy, aren't we?

41:58.610 --> 41:59.928
I've had a great day.

41:59.929 --> 42:02.519
Why can't it just be like this?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.483
What's, what is so wrong with that?

42:20.479 --> 42:22.979
Are you even gonna look at me?

42:25.240 --> 42:26.999
I think what we have
right now is wonderful.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.199
Okay, I...

42:29.200 --> 42:30.779
I think the last six months have been

42:30.780 --> 42:32.083
just beyond amazing.

42:32.930 --> 42:34.579
I don't know where I'm
gonna be in the future,

42:34.580 --> 42:36.439
I don't even know where I'm
gonna be in three weeks.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.669
Okay?

42:39.670 --> 42:41.307
I think what we have is fine.

42:59.830 --> 43:00.880
It's over now anyway.

43:08.916 --> 43:13.916
What?

43:26.410 --> 43:27.799
Would a guy trying to trap a girl

43:27.800 --> 43:29.719
spend 80% of his life savings

43:29.720 --> 43:31.920
putting her on a solo
trip around the world?

43:36.350 --> 43:37.350
Yes.

43:38.810 --> 43:39.899
What?

43:39.900 --> 43:40.900
Cancel it.

43:42.870 --> 43:43.722
What?

43:43.723 --> 43:44.849
No, no.

43:44.850 --> 43:47.429
I'm not gonna cancel it.

43:47.430 --> 43:50.080
This is like the ultimate
control right here, okay?

43:51.400 --> 43:52.519
I wanna go.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.899
I really, really wanna go, okay?

43:53.900 --> 43:55.809
But I wanna do it my own way.

43:55.810 --> 43:57.209
I wanna find my own way of getting there.

43:57.210 --> 43:59.076
I don't need you to pay something for me.

43:59.077 --> 44:00.929
I'll get money from my parents,

44:00.930 --> 44:02.545
I'll put it on someone's credit card,

44:02.546 --> 44:04.459
I'll do the crowd funding thing.

44:04.460 --> 44:05.739
Fuck it, I'll do it if I have to,

44:05.740 --> 44:06.989
but I'm gonna find my own way.

44:06.990 --> 44:10.489
You already have a free ticket from me.

44:10.490 --> 44:13.499
You have one from some
that you care about.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.299
If you wanna pay me back,
you can pay me back.

44:15.300 --> 44:16.133
If you don't wanna pay me back,

44:16.134 --> 44:17.339
you don't have to pay me back.

44:17.340 --> 44:20.969
I will cancel if you want me

44:20.970 --> 44:25.949
to get rid of an opportunity
for you to see the world.

44:25.950 --> 44:27.329
Is that what you really want?

44:27.330 --> 44:28.563
It is a click away.

44:29.510 --> 44:31.273
How long have you got to cancel it?

44:32.290 --> 44:34.089
Uh, officially, it's two weeks

44:34.090 --> 44:36.559
before you're supposed to
leave, like, to the dot.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
So that's

44:39.810 --> 44:42.499
three hours and 22 minutes from now.

44:42.500 --> 44:43.545
Okay.

44:43.546 --> 44:46.979
Thank you so much for putting
me in this position, okay?

44:46.980 --> 44:48.239
Has this whole day been a lie?

44:48.240 --> 44:50.409
Has this been about you using this day

44:50.410 --> 44:53.319
to try and get me to your level

44:53.320 --> 44:54.649
so that I'm in your life forever

44:54.650 --> 44:56.829
with the whole open the
whole bakery thing, and...

44:56.830 --> 44:58.079
You're a baker!

44:58.080 --> 44:59.536
You like baking!

44:59.537 --> 45:01.359
And the period track app, yeah?

45:01.360 --> 45:02.926
You're saying the whole no condom thing

45:02.927 --> 45:03.837
and trying to get me pregnant?

45:03.838 --> 45:05.009
You're trying to control my body, too?

45:05.010 --> 45:06.896
I can't feel anything
with a condom, it's,

45:06.897 --> 45:09.239
and I haven't felt anything in, ooh...

45:09.240 --> 45:12.529
No, you're being controlling,
manipulative, and selfish.

45:12.530 --> 45:14.979
And frankly, I don't what
I'm gonna say to you...

45:14.980 --> 45:15.847
- I'm selfish, I'm selfish?
- Yeah, you're selfish.

45:15.848 --> 45:17.199
I'm fucking selfish?

45:17.200 --> 45:20.689
I am the fucking Giving Tree.

45:20.690 --> 45:22.158
Of course you don't know what that is.

45:22.159 --> 45:24.169
Maybe you're like too
young or too Kiwi, okay?

45:24.170 --> 45:25.379
But a fucking Giving Tree,

45:25.380 --> 45:27.189
over here, this is a
little branch over here,

45:27.190 --> 45:28.499
when you date too many douchebags,

45:28.500 --> 45:30.278
I shade you from it, right?

45:30.279 --> 45:32.329
And underneath it, you want your freedom.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.939
I go ahead and give you another branch.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.529
And then you wanna leave me forever

45:37.530 --> 45:39.223
in two fucking weeks?

45:40.200 --> 45:41.879
You're just like a woodpecker.

45:41.880 --> 45:45.049
Just peck, peck, peck, peck,
peck, peck, peck, peck, peck,

45:45.050 --> 45:46.967
peck, peck, peck, peck!

45:47.890 --> 45:49.719
You think I'm trying to control you?

45:49.720 --> 45:52.963
I would give you, and I
do give you, everything.

46:06.010 --> 46:07.444
Hey, beautiful.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.289
Congratulations!

46:10.290 --> 46:11.499
Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much,

46:11.500 --> 46:13.289
but honestly, that was my bad anyway.

46:13.290 --> 46:14.449
Angie, you came here for,

46:14.450 --> 46:16.473
but that was like three minutes ago.

46:17.580 --> 46:19.829
No, I just saw the
trip post on my way here.

46:19.830 --> 46:22.830
I came for fantasy day 'cause of the trip.

46:22.831 --> 46:25.189
Maybe I shouldn't have sent that, we...

46:25.190 --> 46:26.699
Once in a life time opportunity,

46:26.700 --> 46:27.979
Lizzie Conley is living out

46:27.980 --> 46:30.059
all her life's fantasies in one day!

46:30.060 --> 46:32.372
Yeah, but maybe just the two of us.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.010
Guess who she wants to
help round out the list.

46:34.011 --> 46:35.759
13 Green Lane, see you soon.

46:35.760 --> 46:38.559
I wrote back, but you never replied, so,

46:38.560 --> 46:39.960
what am I here to help with?

46:44.082 --> 46:44.961
What?

46:44.962 --> 46:46.829
That one
wasn't my idea, I swear.

46:46.830 --> 46:47.663
Look, he's just a...

46:47.664 --> 46:51.830
What, are we back at uni now?

46:53.090 --> 46:54.469
Fucking guys.

46:54.470 --> 46:56.320
I mean, why would he even think that?

47:00.890 --> 47:01.890
Lizzie?

47:05.200 --> 47:07.969
Okay, just a few times, okay?

47:07.970 --> 47:12.970
Maybe we fantasize about other girls,

47:13.270 --> 47:16.489
and we randomly come
across somebody's profile...

47:16.490 --> 47:17.543
Like my profile?

47:20.010 --> 47:21.639
Yup.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
Um,

47:23.710 --> 47:25.089
Lizzie,

47:25.090 --> 47:26.090
that's...

47:28.490 --> 47:29.490
Awesome.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.733
I mean, why do you do that?

47:36.780 --> 47:39.830
Um, Jesus, 'cause you're a goddess.

47:39.831 --> 47:42.539
Like you do the Bali
street clean ups with kids,

47:42.540 --> 47:45.239
and you do triathlons and seminars and...

47:45.240 --> 47:46.509
Oh, that reminds me,

47:46.510 --> 47:48.069
I'm totally behind on
my squirting workshop.

47:48.070 --> 47:49.620
That's what I mean, you just,

47:50.520 --> 47:52.241
squirting's real?

47:52.242 --> 47:53.242
Ah.

47:54.530 --> 47:55.530
Mm-hmm.

47:56.900 --> 47:58.389
I mean, you know,

47:58.390 --> 48:01.513
why do you do that with girls in general?

48:03.330 --> 48:04.379
I don't know.

48:04.380 --> 48:07.189
Keeps it light, and I
think he might be open

48:07.190 --> 48:09.279
to other possibilities, so...

48:09.280 --> 48:11.559
But you're keeping your
options open, too, right?

48:11.560 --> 48:12.660
I mean, with the trip?

48:16.722 --> 48:17.722
No.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.009
My mom keeps sending me these articles

48:21.010 --> 48:22.539
on my chronic indecisiveness

48:22.540 --> 48:23.989
and that it's a sign of depression.

48:23.990 --> 48:26.099
Well, then that's an epidemic.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.929
I was watching this
Ted Talk the other day,

48:27.930 --> 48:30.689
and it was talking about tech and mobile

48:30.690 --> 48:32.589
and all these options that are open to us,

48:32.590 --> 48:36.059
and with everything out
there, we just freeze.

48:36.060 --> 48:39.143
You know, it's like paradox of choice.

48:40.210 --> 48:41.210
Hm.

48:43.652 --> 48:44.919
Tell you what,

48:44.920 --> 48:49.920
you can choose not to sexually explore me.

48:50.478 --> 48:51.919
Thanks.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.193
You know, unless you want to.

48:55.349 --> 48:56.229
What?

48:56.229 --> 48:57.062
Angie!

48:57.063 --> 49:01.089
You're the one who's always
posting those YOLO memes.

49:01.090 --> 49:03.369
Potentially, I could be interested

49:03.370 --> 49:07.940
in a little bit of real
life, you-only-live-once,

49:09.370 --> 49:10.370
real YOLO.

49:14.390 --> 49:16.889
Finally having the chance
to get it on with Lizzie,

49:16.890 --> 49:19.519
I mean, you know, because girls...

49:19.520 --> 49:20.353
We're so shy.

49:20.354 --> 49:23.053
Yeah, we're not aggressive like men.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.999
We think we know what we want, but...

49:26.000 --> 49:27.399
We just need a little guidance.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.119
- A push.
- Yeah.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.889
Men, they have that
objective brain, you know.

49:31.890 --> 49:33.759
They can see the big picture.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.193
Well, I mean, I would
never say that exactly.

49:37.448 --> 49:38.281
Yep.

49:38.281 --> 49:39.240
So when this opportunity came up

49:39.241 --> 49:40.869
in the six years that
we've known each other,

49:40.870 --> 49:42.312
it was like...
Yeah, it was like-

49:42.313 --> 49:44.628
Like had that hesitation before.

49:44.629 --> 49:45.462
Right.

49:45.463 --> 49:49.309
But then after a while, it's
like, what's the big deal?

49:49.310 --> 49:50.459
But do you remember the fantasy,

49:50.460 --> 49:51.659
it wasn't about me and Angie,

49:51.660 --> 49:54.263
it was about you and me
doing something with Angie.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.139
Yeah.

49:57.140 --> 49:58.339
I just thought it would be a way

49:58.340 --> 50:00.989
for you and I to connect
a little bit more.

50:00.990 --> 50:02.159
How?

50:02.160 --> 50:04.179
I mean, great.

50:04.180 --> 50:05.180
But, I mean, I don't...

50:05.181 --> 50:08.609
Well, it's about new
experiences for you and me,

50:08.610 --> 50:10.159
and it's not just you teaching me.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.243
No offense.

50:12.677 --> 50:14.843
I don't think he wants to.

50:15.790 --> 50:18.129
No, I'm up for learning new things.

50:18.130 --> 50:19.225
Yeah?

50:19.226 --> 50:20.226
Then come on in.

50:21.666 --> 50:22.499
Yeah?

50:22.499 --> 50:23.499
- Yeah.
- Mm.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.560
Okay!

50:29.780 --> 50:30.780
All right.

50:36.460 --> 50:37.293
Uh...

50:37.293 --> 50:38.126
Got the lube?

50:38.127 --> 50:39.412
You know me.

50:39.413 --> 50:41.839
Uh, Lizzie actually
never really needs that.

50:41.840 --> 50:42.820
- So...
- Oh.

50:42.820 --> 50:43.820
You will.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.409
Wait, what, what're we doing?

50:47.410 --> 50:49.649
Sexual exploration.

50:49.650 --> 50:51.639
Oh, wait, this is Ryan
we're talking about.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.440
He's already had a prostate massage.

50:54.280 --> 50:55.529
No.

50:55.530 --> 50:57.763
Oh. Well, then take 'em off.

50:59.560 --> 51:00.869
I don't need that.

51:00.870 --> 51:02.403
How do you know unless you try?

51:04.190 --> 51:06.369
We're really happy with what we have.

51:06.370 --> 51:07.203
Right, honey?

51:07.204 --> 51:09.929
It's A plus, like, 100%.

51:09.930 --> 51:12.139
Yeah, but Angie was
reading in this Vice article

51:12.140 --> 51:14.449
that the prostate is the male G-spot

51:14.450 --> 51:17.547
and the massage is the new blowjob, so...

51:19.730 --> 51:20.779
'Kay.

51:20.780 --> 51:22.083
The last time somebody,

51:23.842 --> 51:27.523
it was my doctor checking for tumors.

51:28.530 --> 51:30.969
And it didn't feel like a blowjob.

51:30.970 --> 51:32.519
At all.

51:32.520 --> 51:35.259
He probably just didn't read
the same article, you know?

51:35.260 --> 51:38.729
Look, I think I can
remember all the details.

51:38.730 --> 51:40.409
I'll just run Lizzie through it,

51:40.410 --> 51:43.229
and then you guys can
explore each other together.

51:43.230 --> 51:44.230
Right?

51:47.401 --> 51:49.060
Is that what you want?

51:49.061 --> 51:50.061
Yeah.

52:01.009 --> 52:01.842
No.

52:01.842 --> 52:02.831
Oh, no.

52:02.832 --> 52:05.081
Oh, no, it's so mean!

52:05.082 --> 52:06.512
That's what you get
for trying to put me on

52:06.513 --> 52:08.839
into fucking my friend, asshole!

52:08.840 --> 52:12.193
I'm sorry, I was honestly
just trying to, like,

52:13.230 --> 52:15.089
be an idiot, I guess, but...
Mmhmm.

52:15.090 --> 52:16.129
Oh, man.

52:16.130 --> 52:17.489
I woulda done it, too.

52:17.490 --> 52:18.649
I swear, I really woulda done it.

52:18.650 --> 52:21.699
That was abundantly clear.

52:21.700 --> 52:22.979
Well, I'll send Lizzie the article,

52:22.980 --> 52:24.589
and she can teach people

52:24.590 --> 52:26.319
all around the world
on her trip, you know?

52:26.320 --> 52:27.638
Cultural exchange.

52:29.590 --> 52:31.493
You're still going on your trip, right?

52:33.060 --> 52:36.180
You're not stickin' around for this guy.

52:37.870 --> 52:40.020
I mean, that list, it's
not even about you.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.649
Hey, I, I love her.

52:44.650 --> 52:45.650
Yeah, so?

52:55.473 --> 52:57.189
Because if you love someone,

52:57.190 --> 52:59.859
you want their life to be
as full as yours was, right?

52:59.860 --> 53:01.599
I mean, it's only reasonable.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.476
Why are you trying to reason everything?

53:03.477 --> 53:05.159
Everything has to be reason, facts,

53:05.160 --> 53:07.256
logic, statistics, that sort of thing,

53:07.257 --> 53:09.619
and love shouldn't ever
have to be about that.

53:09.620 --> 53:10.719
No, I'm not trying to do that.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.619
No, I mean, I don't know.

53:12.620 --> 53:14.529
I mean, there's a lot of
science to it, though, right?

53:14.530 --> 53:16.049
Aren't you supposed to
figure out relationships?

53:16.050 --> 53:18.227
Isn't that what relationships are about?

53:19.100 --> 53:21.529
Okay, well, let's say, um,

53:21.530 --> 53:22.679
let's say you have a couple.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.199
They've been together their whole lives.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.969
Both of them have been completely
unfaithful to each other,

53:27.970 --> 53:30.924
and the other person is not aware of this.

53:30.925 --> 53:31.758
Okay.

53:31.759 --> 53:33.309
They live our their
whole lives together.

53:33.310 --> 53:36.779
Kids, grandkids, and die happily.

53:36.780 --> 53:38.779
I mean, is that reasonable?

53:38.780 --> 53:39.640
No, no, no.

53:39.641 --> 53:42.779
'Cause if you start a
relationship on a basis of lies,

53:42.780 --> 53:45.373
then it's not a real relationship.

53:47.330 --> 53:48.585
Okay.

53:48.586 --> 53:49.586
Okay.

53:57.390 --> 53:58.390
So we have...

54:01.550 --> 54:02.613
Happy couple.

54:07.430 --> 54:12.009
Uh, happiness plus millions of lies,

54:12.010 --> 54:13.633
divided by no breakup,

54:14.880 --> 54:16.123
equals,

54:19.150 --> 54:20.489
but it's not...

54:20.490 --> 54:21.609
So these guys don't break up

54:21.610 --> 54:24.283
because of the millions of lies.

54:41.525 --> 54:44.013
You realize what just happened, right?

54:44.014 --> 54:45.283
You just kicked my ass.

54:46.300 --> 54:47.600
For the second time today.

54:48.490 --> 54:51.889
I mean, I guess my degree was useful.

54:51.890 --> 54:52.993
Yeah, check it off.

54:53.885 --> 54:54.885
Okay.

54:56.440 --> 54:57.440
Oh, look.

55:07.010 --> 55:07.843
Is this what you wanted?

55:07.844 --> 55:10.629
For me to win this
argument or this debate?

55:10.630 --> 55:12.349
It's cool when you win arguments.

55:12.350 --> 55:15.109
But, no, that's not,
I'm not living to win,

55:15.110 --> 55:16.199
or to have you win or anything.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.562
I want something good, you know?

55:18.563 --> 55:20.389
I just don't want to fight, that's all.

55:20.390 --> 55:22.079
I mean, I come from, you know, my parents,

55:22.080 --> 55:23.209
they were high school sweethearts,

55:23.210 --> 55:24.309
and now they hate each other

55:24.310 --> 55:26.009
because they just keep fighting
and fighting and fighting,

55:26.010 --> 55:28.129
and my dad keeps on wining,
and I hate watching that.

55:28.130 --> 55:29.199
I don't wanna win.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.033
Don't wanna win.

55:30.034 --> 55:31.169
Yeah.

55:31.170 --> 55:32.003
Mm, ha ha.

55:32.004 --> 55:33.563
So what do you want to do?

55:35.933 --> 55:38.279
How much time do we have?

55:38.280 --> 55:40.043
Till the, yeah, um,

55:40.880 --> 55:41.880
let's see.

55:44.900 --> 55:46.463
An hour and 38 minutes.

55:47.543 --> 55:48.543
Okay.

55:49.670 --> 55:51.749
Well, if you want to be real scientific

55:51.750 --> 55:53.819
about this whole thing,

55:53.820 --> 55:56.139
I read an article about
how if you ask each other

55:56.140 --> 55:57.169
36 questions,

55:57.170 --> 55:58.479
and then by the end of
it, you're apparently...

55:58.480 --> 56:00.979
Oh, you're supposed to be
falling in love at the end.

56:00.980 --> 56:02.761
And you're supposed to,

56:02.762 --> 56:04.019
you're supposed to stare
in each other's eyes

56:04.020 --> 56:05.451
for a few minutes.

56:05.452 --> 56:06.491
We can do that.

56:07.326 --> 56:08.639
I'm starving, though.

56:08.640 --> 56:11.659
Okay, um, we have pizza from Blake.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.650
Mm.

56:12.651 --> 56:13.779
Can we bake some cookies?

56:13.780 --> 56:15.079
Yes, totally, bake cookies?

56:15.080 --> 56:16.651
Yeah.

56:16.652 --> 56:17.652
All right.

56:19.420 --> 56:22.869
Uh, start off with this,

56:22.870 --> 56:26.231
and we got butter...
Ryan, pick up the phone.

56:26.232 --> 56:27.561
- Okay.
- Ryan...

56:27.562 --> 56:28.929
- Is that your dad?
- Pick up the phone.

56:28.930 --> 56:30.459
Yeah, but he calls me all the time, so...

56:30.460 --> 56:32.549
It's okay, you haven't
spoke to him in like a month.

56:32.550 --> 56:33.383
It's fine.

56:33.383 --> 56:34.237
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

56:34.238 --> 56:37.209
Just like two minutes just
to get rid of him, okay?

56:37.210 --> 56:39.649
All right, there's some like
baking stuff over there.

56:39.650 --> 56:42.147
Ryan, pick up the phone.

56:56.602 --> 56:59.351
Just add egg and vegetable oil.

57:14.372 --> 57:15.539
Vegetable oil.

57:18.121 --> 57:20.089
You know what's goin'
on with your nephews?

57:20.090 --> 57:22.499
One of them has size 12 shoe,

57:22.500 --> 57:26.169
and he's probably now
about five foot seven.

57:26.170 --> 57:28.669
You got a mother and father who are aging,

57:28.670 --> 57:32.062
a family that you have
become estranged from,

57:32.063 --> 57:34.849
because you're not there for the weddings,

57:34.850 --> 57:38.449
for the funerals, for the Thanksgiving,

57:38.450 --> 57:39.759
the other holidays.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.743
You're just, like, out of it.

57:45.372 --> 57:47.017
Okay, add eggs and,

57:49.950 --> 57:50.950
vegetable oil.

57:52.604 --> 57:53.604
But...

57:57.524 --> 57:58.524
Fuck.

58:05.103 --> 58:06.191
You're not making any money,

58:06.192 --> 58:07.382
you're putting in all these hours.

58:07.383 --> 58:09.679
Over here, you'd get a decent job,

58:09.680 --> 58:10.752
and do whatever you want.

58:10.753 --> 58:12.602
America is a land of opportunity.

58:12.603 --> 58:14.119
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I've got a pool.

58:14.120 --> 58:14.953
I've got a spa.

58:14.954 --> 58:16.779
I got him on mute, don't worry.

58:16.780 --> 58:17.799
What are you using this stuff for?

58:17.800 --> 58:19.359
This is Jono's shit.

58:19.360 --> 58:20.509
I have a barbecue.

58:20.510 --> 58:22.739
Baking stuff is over here, okay?

58:22.740 --> 58:23.573
I'll get it for you.

58:23.574 --> 58:25.139
In our backyard.

58:25.140 --> 58:26.849
Oh, yeah, I got a new Porsche.

58:26.850 --> 58:28.989
It not only has tushy warmers,

58:28.990 --> 58:31.169
it has tushy coolers.

58:31.170 --> 58:34.799
This one on a hot day, you
put on the tushy cooler,

58:34.800 --> 58:37.019
and it circulates cold air

58:37.020 --> 58:40.109
so you don't get that
clammy feeling on your seat.

58:40.110 --> 58:41.429
It looks like my butt's gonna be clammy

58:41.430 --> 58:42.430
for a while, Dad.

58:43.601 --> 58:45.699
Do you have a car over there?

58:45.700 --> 58:47.259
No, I take the bus, Dad.

58:47.260 --> 58:49.079
But a lot of people take the bus,

58:49.080 --> 58:52.249
but what I mean is, like,
I'm establishing myself here.

58:52.250 --> 58:54.849
Like, I'm making something of myself,

58:54.850 --> 58:57.834
and I'm spending a lot
of time with Lizzie, so...

58:57.835 --> 59:00.083
I don't know anything about her.

59:00.084 --> 59:04.239
Dad, I tell you about
her all the time, you know?

59:04.240 --> 59:05.729
She's awesome.

59:05.730 --> 59:08.579
And I support her, you know?

59:08.580 --> 59:09.915
100%.

59:09.916 --> 59:11.329
What do
you mean you support her?

59:11.330 --> 59:12.819
You mean you're being supportive of her,

59:12.820 --> 59:14.579
you're not supporting her, God forbid.

59:14.580 --> 59:16.963
No, Dad, I would never do that, okay?

59:18.033 --> 59:19.766
I mean, I would of course do that

59:19.767 --> 59:21.519
if I'm in a more financially...

59:21.520 --> 59:23.153
What'd she go to school for?

59:24.904 --> 59:26.209
Philosophy.

59:26.210 --> 59:27.180
Philosophy?

59:27.181 --> 59:28.452
That's for people who
can't make up their mind

59:28.453 --> 59:29.899
what they wanna do.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.529
Why didn't she major like in business

59:31.530 --> 59:33.629
so she can make a living to support you

59:33.630 --> 59:36.289
because I'm not sure you'll
be able to support yourself.

59:36.290 --> 59:37.462
You think she's doin', like,

59:37.463 --> 59:39.233
what the Russian brides do?

59:42.215 --> 59:43.619
Dad, what're you talkin' about?

59:43.620 --> 59:45.209
They put ads in the paper,

59:45.210 --> 59:46.989
they put ads on the internet,

59:46.990 --> 59:49.769
and they come over as a Russian bride,

59:49.770 --> 59:50.999
and they're just the
sweetest things in the world

59:51.000 --> 59:52.939
and they do everything for you

59:52.940 --> 59:54.816
'cause they want the Green Card.

59:54.817 --> 59:56.789
I think she's got higher
aspirations than that, Dad.

59:56.790 --> 59:59.219
Yeah, she's a pretty mean baker.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.489
If she
wants to bake, she can bake

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:01.740
cookies for her children.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.120
Uh,

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.879
maybe.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.049
What do you have in common
with the girls in New Zealand?

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:10.883
Nothing.

01:00:10.884 --> 01:00:13.309
Maybe there's a Lizzie over here.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.099
A good old American Lizzie.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.100
Dad, come on.

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:20.433
I don't think we're gonna
find another Lizzie anywhere.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.420
What about that Jessica girl,

01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:25.643
the one you were with when
you were here last time?

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:27.583
Dad.

01:00:27.584 --> 01:00:28.999
We went to buy
new furniture for a house.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.479
- Dad.
- Lo and behold...

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.919
Dad, Dad, Dad, I got to go, okay?

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.999
But I wanna let you know
that it's time for you

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.509
to start showing some
respect for me, okay?

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:40.219
I'm really establishing myself
out here in the tech world.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.053
Okay?

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.429
You're not even on Instagram.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.230
Everybody's on Instagram except you.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.420
Mm.

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:29.509
Uh, first one.

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:30.529
Pfft, easy.

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:33.129
If you could have any super
power, what would it be?

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:34.830
Obviously invisibility. Flying.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.753
Yes.

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:37.859
Invisible flying.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.430
Like Wonder Woman's plane, right?

01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:40.881
Okay, cool.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.563
Name three things you both
appear to have in common.

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.869
Uh,

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.547
gorgeous blue eyes.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.929
You're not blue.

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:53.930
Pale.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.753
Have a fuck load of fun.

01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:08.399
I'm sure the third will come with time.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.423
Uh, great hair.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.779
Wow, thanks.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:15.939
It's a little bit higher
each year, but okay.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.799
We'll have less and less
in common over time.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.919
Unless you thin out when you're older.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.509
We're both very flexible.

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:23.379
- Flexible.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.380
Okay.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.367
And...

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.803
Both unsure about the future.

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:39.080
Uh, what is the greatest
accomplishment of your life?

01:03:46.745 --> 01:03:48.089
Do you wanna have kids?

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.849
Is that on,

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:51.649
uh, separate, okay.

01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:52.693
Uh, yes.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:59.589
Do you wanna have kids?

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:01.289
One of my greatest fears
when I was growing up

01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:04.239
was that, well, when
I was 18 specifically,

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.429
I remember that I was afraid

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:07.549
that by the time I reached 30,

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:09.809
I would be single and childless.

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:10.800
I know, I know, it's strange,

01:04:10.801 --> 01:04:12.299
but I still think about it now.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.171
I really, really want to travel,

01:04:14.172 --> 01:04:15.969
but could I do that with a kid?

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:16.803
I don't know.

01:04:16.804 --> 01:04:19.639
But at the same time, if I travel,

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.239
and I come back back,
and when I meet someone,

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.399
will it be too late?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.629
Will I have, I dunno, dried
up by then?

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:26.463
I dunno.

01:04:26.464 --> 01:04:29.920
I mean, I just feel like it's
my species responsibility

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:33.139
to procreate in some way, right?

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:33.973
I mean, isn't that what it's about?

01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:38.973
It's like eating, defecating,
and populating, right?

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:41.949
Well, that's why the globe
is so overpopulated, right?

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:43.356
I read an article that if you had your SUV

01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:46.679
parked in a driveway and
running 24 hours a day,

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.839
that that's still gonna
impact the environment

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.490
a lot less than if you were
to raise a western child.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.199
That's the first I've
heard that you've read up

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.643
on any of that eco stuff.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.269
If you knew you were going to die today,

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:12.573
what would you most regret
not telling someone?

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.277
Can we skip this one?

01:05:18.278 --> 01:05:19.749
It should be really easy.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:20.583
We don't have enough time.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.416
Just say it.

01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:22.390
No, we don't have enough time.

01:05:22.391 --> 01:05:23.739
We have enough time!

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:24.849
I run the, just say it!

01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:26.173
How hard is it to say?

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.440
You have enough time to say one thing.

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:31.540
You can do it.

01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:33.859
Come on, just say what you wanna say.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.949
How hard is it just to say

01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:37.439
what you wanna say to somebody?

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.940
Just say it, say the one
thing that you wanna say.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.877
Okay?

01:05:45.878 --> 01:05:46.878
Okay.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.183
What is Zed Picket Fence?

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:04.859
You've been going through my laptop?

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.349
When you came back
from the US last month,

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:08.039
I asked to borrow your computer,

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040
while you, Mr. Eco-friendly,

01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:11.759
were taking a 40-fucking-minute
shower, by the way,

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.399
and this was just an open
window on your computer.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.509
And I didn't think
anything of it at the time,

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:19.423
but do you mind telling me
what these pictures are?

01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:24.830
It's pictures.

01:06:26.618 --> 01:06:28.701
And what about Jessica?

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.809
You brought her up like three times

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:34.566
since you got back from the US.

01:06:34.567 --> 01:06:37.646
And I may have Facebook
stalked her from your profile,

01:06:37.647 --> 01:06:40.179
and I saw an album on there

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.719
that matched the exact same photos

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.170
that you have on this folder.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:48.470
Okay, sit down.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:50.730
Sit down.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.240
Ryan,

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.719
if you want to be in a
genuine relationship with me,

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.453
you have to start being genuine.

01:07:13.882 --> 01:07:14.882
Okay.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.600
Okay.

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:18.593
Jessica, she's,

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.983
I went out with her in my senior year,

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:24.313
and things were nice.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.219
And my dad told me to break up with her

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.969
because, you know,

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:30.389
there'd be tons of other girls in college,

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:31.823
and don't settle too early.

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.439
Fast forward 18 years later,

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.083
she finds me on Facebook,

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.396
and I just became obsessed.

01:07:41.397 --> 01:07:45.379
I mean, she was with a guy
that she got pregnant with,

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.419
and they have these almost grown up kids.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.629
Grown up.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.329
I haven't even grown up, you know?

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.743
So her husband was out of town,

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.119
and the kids were away, you
know, with the grandparents,

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.449
and so we went out to dinner

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:05.599
to the old diner that we
always went to in high school.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:08.059
And she was, it was really nice.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.393
It was like old times.

01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:12.609
And I drove her home.

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.559
And the house that she lives in now

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.893
is the same house that she grew up in.

01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:19.538
And so I'd been there before,

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.406
and she was telling me
about all these renovations,

01:08:21.407 --> 01:08:22.639
and so we went inside,

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.439
and it was pretty dark.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.158
We walked to the basement,

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.283
and we were sitting there,

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:31.260
and we didn't.

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.210
We didn't do...

01:08:37.836 --> 01:08:40.252
But, I mean, we kissed, okay?

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.330
Okay?

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:44.279
All right.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:45.279
That's good.

01:08:46.546 --> 01:08:49.129
And so, um,

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:51.622
there was a thought in my mind, like, wow,

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:55.129
I'm gonna be with this girl
for the rest of my life.

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.569
This is exactly what I wanted,

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:58.839
and I felt 100% at home

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.723
for the first time in like 18 years.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:04.059
Did you ever think about
me at all during that?

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.499
Oh my God, man, I thought about you

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.203
every fucking step of the way.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.143
You know?

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:11.049
And that wasn't good, 'cause
we're not supposed to,

01:09:11.050 --> 01:09:12.116
I'm not supposed to think about you.

01:09:12.117 --> 01:09:14.263
I'm supposed to be free and open, right?

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:18.488
And as I'm thinking about
this, she took me upstairs,

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:20.779
and I don't know why, but
she flipped on the light

01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:23.179
when we were at the top of the stairs,

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.013
and everything changed.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.099
The appliances were shiny,

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:33.749
and all of the edges were hard and white,

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.233
and it just wasn't,

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.533
it wasn't home anymore.

01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:41.828
And she took me up the stairs

01:09:41.830 --> 01:09:44.679
to what used to be her
parents' master bedroom,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.529
and it just wasn't right,
and I just freaked.

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:49.109
I just said, "I got to get outta here."

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:51.184
So I said I had to use the bathroom.

01:09:51.185 --> 01:09:53.769
You know, the
oldest excuse in the book.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:55.559
And she and I had sex in that bathroom

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.969
when we were in high school,

01:09:56.970 --> 01:10:01.609
and now, at that same sink,

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:02.999
that one.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.079
The rest are from Facebook,

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.639
but I shot that one 'cause I just,

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.640
it hit me.

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:09.793
Those two toothbrushes, man.

01:10:11.028 --> 01:10:13.448
I thought, this is not my home.

01:10:13.449 --> 01:10:15.387
This is not my place, you know?

01:10:16.399 --> 01:10:18.919
And it was, fuck,

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.849
it was weird, you know?

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.533
It was weird being there.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.709
And I left,

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:29.166
and then I was like, oh,
God, I forgot my phone.

01:10:29.167 --> 01:10:31.889
And so I went back to get my phone,

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:32.810
and she was in the bathroom,

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:34.519
and she told me to hold on a minute,

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.783
and I swear to God, that was it.

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:42.383
What about that one?

01:10:43.879 --> 01:10:45.209
I don't know why she took that.

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:46.210
It's,

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:50.349
maybe it was some kinda thing

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:51.850
to tell me she's still got it?

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:54.973
Or to stay away.

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:57.910
Yeah, maybe that's it,

01:10:57.911 --> 01:11:00.060
that's what that whole
folder is, you know?

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560
So I guess you're off the hook

01:11:02.561 --> 01:11:04.110
and you didn't break any rules.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.103
I was hiding.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.660
I was hiding to protect our relationship.

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:14.889
'Cause I didn't wanna say this,

01:11:14.890 --> 01:11:16.133
but I got to say it now.

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.693
It was never about Jessica.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.093
I don't think the white
picket fence is for me.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.959
You don't want success?

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.259
No, no, no, it's not about success.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.739
I would love to be a success,

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.693
but it's that, like, it's that lifestyle.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.539
PTA, the poker nights,

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.859
the watering, and the herbiciding,

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.421
and the mowing of the grass.

01:11:47.422 --> 01:11:52.049
The making sure you have new
furniture every five years,

01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:53.913
you now, like the white picket fence.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.423
It's not for me.

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:01.450
And I was afraid that if I told you that

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.539
then you would wanna leave

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.591
and I couldn't risk that.

01:12:05.592 --> 01:12:07.206
I couldn't risk that.

01:12:07.207 --> 01:12:08.209
I don't wanna risk that.

01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:10.703
It's not like we talked
about longterm anyway.

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:14.019
Oh, come on, are you kidding me?

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.909
Longterm, that's all I ever
think about is longterm.

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:19.222
You think that this whole eco thing,

01:12:19.223 --> 01:12:21.459
echo hippy thing that I do, right,

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.209
aren't you a little bit concerned

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:25.296
as to why this started out of nowhere?

01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:27.099
I think you're too busy
thinking about the fucking planet

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.820
to think about what's
right in front of you.

01:12:29.651 --> 01:12:32.069
That's what I think.

01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:36.459
Three months ago I
decided that I loved you

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.060
more than anybody I've ever met.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.409
And I see you looking
at those wedding photos.

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:44.309
I see you looking at the dresses,

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.009
I see you looking at the pictures

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:48.069
of the carbon copy
McMansions and everything,

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:50.023
and I wanted to give you what you want.

01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:54.419
Three months ago I looked
up the word stability,

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.919
not sustainability, stability, right?

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.049
And what did I find?

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:00.439
I found out that there's climate change,

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.799
I found out about peak oil,

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.279
I found out about soil depletion,

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.086
phosphorous depletion, water pollution.

01:13:05.087 --> 01:13:07.929
There's only half of
one percent of the water

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.069
left for the planet that we can even do,

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:11.009
we're adding 220,000 people
to the planet every day.

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:12.369
You don't think I know
these kinda statistics

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:13.869
that you're citing me out there?

01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:15.029
I know this stuff.

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:16.569
This, this here comes from China,

01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:18.449
this here comes from fucking Korea,

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:20.739
this here is built
entirely on fossil fuels,

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.329
and what happens when we can't afford

01:13:22.330 --> 01:13:24.829
to pull fossil fuels out
of the ground anymore?

01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:26.579
I don't know, are we all
gonna be goin' around

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.159
and carrying spears,

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.059
or are we gonna be like Amish farmers?

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.199
The suburbs are fucked,

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.679
are they gonna just like pave
those down and build farms,

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.209
and throw everybody into super cities?

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.893
Like, I don't know, I have
no idea what's stable.

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.369
Now it might make more sense for you

01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:45.129
to accept what's right in front of you.

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:46.180
Excuse me?

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.180
Say it.

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.853
- What?
- Say you love me!

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.273
Say you wanna be with me.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.760
I'm here.

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:00.926
I'm the most stable thing you got.

01:14:03.965 --> 01:14:05.015
You want the truth?

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.223
You wanna know why this is all like this?

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.369
It's because I met you on fucking Tinder!

01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:17.899
Because all I ever fucking
wanted from you was a fling.

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.299
Yeah, we have great sex and
we have a fucking great time,

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.479
but you're just this old fucking man

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.359
who just can't maintain any
of his fucking relationships!

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.499
Just this fucking startup wannabe,

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.209
you can't even control the damn tickets

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.833
on your own fucking company!

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.763
I knew it was gonna be easy
not to fall in love with you.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.669
Because your life was lacking direction,

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:43.420
you weren't doing anything with it.

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.033
Wow, that's,

01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:57.205
yeah.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.505
I'm sorry, I...

01:15:04.506 --> 01:15:05.679
No, it's...

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.249
I don't know if any of that was true,

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:08.650
I just said that to hurt you

01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:14.033
because I'm afraid of everything.

01:15:14.034 --> 01:15:16.193
Of relationships of,

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560
oh, Jesus.

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:25.153
I'm just not an interesting person.

01:15:26.965 --> 01:15:29.959
I have nothing to offer anybody.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.753
Want some article quotes?

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.799
I'm just another cog in the system,

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.869
just another face in the book.

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:40.066
I'm living my life and
not doing anything with it

01:15:40.067 --> 01:15:41.299
and I don't know why.

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.300
No, no.

01:15:43.365 --> 01:15:45.969
I just sit in front of
a screen most of the week,

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:48.149
I just go on autopilot.

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:49.729
I don't know what to say to people,

01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:52.699
I don't know how to be in any situation

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.759
when I'm looking at these photos
of people getting married,

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.524
and being so happy.

01:15:57.525 --> 01:16:00.479
Just the smiling, and living everything

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.786
that they probably wanted and more.

01:16:01.787 --> 01:16:03.702
And I don't have that, you know?

01:16:03.703 --> 01:16:05.219
I mean, look at me, right?

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.309
I've been like traveling
and experiencing things

01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:09.469
my entire life, you know,
dabbled in this and that,

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:13.979
and yeah, it makes for a very
extensive Facebook profile,

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.330
but where has it gotten me?

01:16:16.274 --> 01:16:17.210
I mean, look at me.

01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:18.469
I'm single, I'm alone,

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:20.179
I've never committed to anything,

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.323
and it's gotten me absolutely nothing.

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:26.113
I'm not some kind of sexy
alternative to stability.

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.567
What is stability?

01:16:32.853 --> 01:16:33.853
You.

01:16:34.746 --> 01:16:35.746
Yeah.

01:16:36.656 --> 01:16:38.073
Stability is you.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.583
You can boil water in it.

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:11.652
And you'll need to.

01:19:43.797 --> 01:19:44.913
Cancel the trip.

01:19:46.234 --> 01:19:47.067
Are you sure?

01:19:47.067 --> 01:19:48.067
Because I can,

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:50.860
okay.

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:03.950
Why'd you do it?

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.840
I'm gonna do it on my own.

01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:11.790
All on your own, or...

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:17.639
How long is the love stare?

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.963
Well, I don't know, but I can Google it.

01:20:20.874 --> 01:20:23.741
Let's just do a minute.
