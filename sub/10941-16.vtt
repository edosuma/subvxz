<i>Previously on "heartland":</i>

00:01.673 --> 00:04.107
You were right,
this is a real honey.

00:04.175 --> 00:05.708
All I gotta do is find
a few parts for it

00:05.776 --> 00:06.842
and she's gonna rock!

00:10.714 --> 00:11.881
I'll get your wheelchair.

00:11.949 --> 00:13.316
No, um...

00:13.384 --> 00:14.884
Could you just grab my crutch?

00:14.952 --> 00:16.953
Yes, Caleb,
you can stay at the dude ranch

00:17.020 --> 00:18.120
until your cast comes off,

00:18.188 --> 00:19.754
or I get a paying customer.

00:19.822 --> 00:20.956
I told you
it was bad luck for me,

00:21.023 --> 00:23.325
and what do you do but show up?

00:23.393 --> 00:24.893
Let's just call it a day.

00:24.961 --> 00:26.195
Fine.

00:26.262 --> 00:27.796
You're not committed to me!

00:27.863 --> 00:29.331
You want proof?
You want proof?

00:29.399 --> 00:31.300
Then marry me, dammit!

01:11.004 --> 01:12.771
Unh!

01:13.940 --> 01:15.307
Let's see what's
for breakfast today?

01:15.375 --> 01:16.675
Hey, hey, hey!

01:16.743 --> 01:19.778
Those are for Caleb, from Lou.

01:19.846 --> 01:22.080
The guy's been doing
nothing for weeks.

01:22.148 --> 01:25.082
Maybe it's time for him
to get his own breakfast.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.851
You'd think you'd be a
little more understanding,

01:26.918 --> 01:29.387
considering everything
you went through with Scott.

01:29.455 --> 01:30.788
Maybe I would be.

01:30.856 --> 01:32.023
No one made me muffins.

01:34.026 --> 01:35.326
All right. Here.

02:02.952 --> 02:04.887
What the hell?
How did they find me?!

02:07.857 --> 02:08.824
<i>Hey!</i>

02:08.892 --> 02:10.658
Hey, what're you doing?!

02:10.726 --> 02:12.026
I only missed two payments.

02:13.062 --> 02:14.329
Come on, man!

02:14.397 --> 02:16.431
Well, the doctor said
he was doing great,

02:16.499 --> 02:19.401
but it would be a miracle
if he was... back on his feet.

02:19.468 --> 02:22.103
<i>That's Caleb's truck.</i>

02:23.072 --> 02:26.674
<i>Get back here!
That's my truck!</i>

02:26.741 --> 02:28.008
He gets around pretty good.

02:28.076 --> 02:30.211
It's a miracle.

03:19.524 --> 03:22.293
So, I've got the invitations
for the engagement party,

03:22.361 --> 03:24.762
I booked the rehearsal dinner.

03:24.829 --> 03:28.633
So I think I've got everything
under control.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.867
Um... except, Grampa,

03:30.934 --> 03:32.835
I need to talk to you
about Lisa.

03:32.903 --> 03:35.004
- Lisa?
- Yeah, um...

03:35.072 --> 03:36.373
Actually, about you and Lisa.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.241
Why? Did...

03:38.309 --> 03:39.709
Did she say something to you?

03:39.777 --> 03:42.178
I don't wanna cause
any problems.

03:42.246 --> 03:44.781
But you know that really nice
reception room

03:44.848 --> 03:45.948
Lisa has at Fairfield?

03:46.016 --> 03:47.549
What are you talking about?

03:47.617 --> 03:50.319
The out-of-towners brunch
for our wedding.

03:50.387 --> 03:52.288
I'll tell ya-

03:52.355 --> 03:53.522
I know it's a huge imposition,

03:53.590 --> 03:54.723
but it would mean so much

03:54.791 --> 03:56.592
if you and Lisa
could host it for me.

03:56.660 --> 03:59.027
I'm on my way
to see her right now,

03:59.095 --> 04:00.629
so I suppose I can...

04:00.697 --> 04:03.097
No pressure. Take your time.

04:03.165 --> 04:04.265
I love you.

04:05.867 --> 04:08.235
I love you too.

04:08.304 --> 04:09.704
So?

04:09.772 --> 04:12.740
How did Lou and Amy
take the news?

04:12.808 --> 04:14.375
Uh, well, to tell you the truth,

04:14.443 --> 04:19.313
uh, I still haven't told 'em.

04:19.380 --> 04:20.846
You promised you would.

04:20.915 --> 04:22.015
I know.

04:23.318 --> 04:25.652
What's really going on here?

04:25.720 --> 04:27.321
Oh well, you see...

04:27.388 --> 04:29.856
The problem is Lou.

04:29.924 --> 04:31.024
Uh, I made a fresh pot.

04:31.091 --> 04:34.093
Oh, great. Thank you, Soraya.

04:34.994 --> 04:37.296
Oh, no. I'm fine thanks.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.432
I just don't wanna rain
on her parade,

04:39.499 --> 04:41.467
and I...

04:41.535 --> 04:44.370
Thought maybe we could
keep this thing

04:44.438 --> 04:46.238
<i>to ourselves a little longer.</i>

04:46.306 --> 04:47.406
This thing?

04:47.474 --> 04:49.308
Mm-hmm.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.510
Our engagement? That thing?

04:56.014 --> 04:57.949
Walk in front of me
so she won't notice.

04:59.685 --> 05:02.119
You can't keep avoiding her,
Mallory.

05:06.491 --> 05:07.825
Hey, Mallory.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.860
<i>I saved you a seat.</i>

05:09.927 --> 05:11.362
I'm sitting with Amy.

05:11.429 --> 05:13.497
You know my friend Amy, right?
She's in grade 12.

05:13.565 --> 05:14.765
Oh, come on, Mallory.

05:14.833 --> 05:16.834
You can't still be mad at me!

05:16.901 --> 05:18.635
The rodeo club tryouts
start tomorrow,

05:18.703 --> 05:19.737
and Rachel and all her friends

05:19.804 --> 05:21.438
are really into pole-bending.

05:21.506 --> 05:22.438
So?

05:22.506 --> 05:24.139
It's like so much fun.

05:24.207 --> 05:25.408
And all the girls
you wanna get in with

05:25.476 --> 05:26.743
are trying out.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.578
No, all the girls
you wanna get in with.

05:28.645 --> 05:30.480
Just come tomorrow!

05:30.547 --> 05:32.782
I know you'll have
a really good shot at it.

05:32.850 --> 05:33.916
Whatever.

05:36.787 --> 05:39.388
Jamie just asked me
to join the rodeo club.

05:39.455 --> 05:41.956
I thought you didn't like Jamie
and all her cool friends.

05:42.024 --> 05:43.625
Yeah, that's why I have
to get really good,

05:43.693 --> 05:45.427
really fast!

05:45.495 --> 05:47.562
What, so you can show them
how much you don't care?

05:47.630 --> 05:49.030
Exactly! Amy, please,

05:49.098 --> 05:51.232
you've gotta help me!

05:54.370 --> 05:55.436
<i>Hey.</i>

05:55.504 --> 05:56.837
In case you actually...

05:56.905 --> 05:59.573
Decide to change your sheets.

05:59.641 --> 06:00.741
Hey, don't worry, Lou.

06:00.809 --> 06:01.975
I promise I'll do it
once a month,

06:02.043 --> 06:03.343
whether I need to or not.

06:03.412 --> 06:04.512
Great.

06:05.847 --> 06:08.416
Sorry to hear about your truck.

06:08.483 --> 06:11.551
Yeah, I don't know how the
hell they found me out here.

06:11.619 --> 06:13.052
Look, I was wondering,
next time you're in town,

06:13.120 --> 06:14.854
if you could put this up
at Maggie's for me?

06:14.922 --> 06:16.723
Sure.

06:16.791 --> 06:17.857
No problem.

06:19.894 --> 06:21.294
You sure about this?

06:21.361 --> 06:22.929
Yeah. A hundred percent.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.566
Okay.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.902
So, uh, what's Jack
been up to these days?

06:29.969 --> 06:32.237
Jack? Like, Grampa?

06:32.305 --> 06:34.005
Yeah. Like is there anything...

06:34.073 --> 06:35.574
Special going on with him?

06:35.642 --> 06:37.509
No, uh...

06:37.577 --> 06:39.878
Well, he was talking about
putting snow tires on his truck.

06:39.946 --> 06:41.480
Why?

06:41.548 --> 06:45.683
Um, it's just he was in here
this morning with Lisa.

06:45.751 --> 06:46.884
<i>But it... It doesn't matter.</i>

06:46.952 --> 06:48.285
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

06:48.353 --> 06:50.220
But you did.

06:50.288 --> 06:51.288
What's up?

06:51.356 --> 06:52.757
All right.

06:52.825 --> 06:55.426
They mentioned something
about an engagement?

06:55.494 --> 06:56.794
Lou's engagement?

06:56.862 --> 06:58.262
Yeah, except...

06:58.330 --> 07:02.298
No, I'm pretty sure
it was their engagement.

07:02.366 --> 07:05.068
Grampa and Lisa
getting married?

07:05.135 --> 07:06.269
Jack and Lisa?

07:07.171 --> 07:08.605
Oooh! I want details!

07:08.673 --> 07:09.940
There are no details, Ashley.

07:10.007 --> 07:12.241
It's just something
I thought I heard.

07:12.309 --> 07:15.210
So, there's no reason
to make a big deal about it.

07:15.278 --> 07:16.211
<i>Right.</i>

07:16.279 --> 07:17.513
I get it,

07:17.581 --> 07:18.914
because your grandfather
isn't marrying

07:18.982 --> 07:20.883
one of the richest women
in Hudson county?

07:20.951 --> 07:23.586
That's right,
so no need to alert the media.

07:23.653 --> 07:24.720
Or my mother.

07:28.825 --> 07:30.825
Looks good, Mallory.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.163
Good.

07:36.231 --> 07:37.832
<i>Come on, Copper!</i>

07:37.900 --> 07:38.633
<i>Okay, keep your outside leg
on him</i>

07:38.701 --> 07:39.901
<i>around the turn.</i>

07:39.969 --> 07:41.302
<i>Just weave through the poles.</i>

07:41.370 --> 07:43.437
Yeah, well, he
doesn't turn very well!

07:43.506 --> 07:44.606
And what's the point
of trotting?

07:44.673 --> 07:45.974
Isn't it all about the speed?

07:46.041 --> 07:48.208
Okay! Try it at a lope then.

07:51.613 --> 07:52.646
Ow!

07:53.715 --> 07:54.815
<i>Ow!</i>

07:56.718 --> 07:57.818
Ah!

08:00.755 --> 08:01.788
Okay, uh...

08:03.423 --> 08:05.324
Amy, this sucks.

08:06.326 --> 08:08.127
Yeah.

08:08.194 --> 08:10.396
You know, I think Copper might
be a little too old and stiff

08:10.463 --> 08:11.564
to be a pole-bending horse.

08:11.632 --> 08:13.633
Great.
What am I supposed to do now?

08:13.700 --> 08:15.701
Well, um...

08:15.769 --> 08:17.069
If you wanna keep
riding Copper,

08:17.137 --> 08:18.803
you could,
you could try something else.

08:18.871 --> 08:21.372
Like what? I don't know...

08:21.440 --> 08:22.674
Goat tying?

08:22.742 --> 08:24.442
And commit social suicide!

08:24.510 --> 08:27.378
Like I could see Jamie
and Rachel tying goats!

08:28.981 --> 08:31.215
So what is this I hear
about an engagement party?

08:31.283 --> 08:33.952
It's what people do
when they get engaged, Dad.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.753
Some people do.

08:35.820 --> 08:36.687
<i>And you know,
it's a nice chance for us all</i>

08:36.755 --> 08:37.888
to meet Peter's family.

08:37.956 --> 08:39.423
I think it's a great idea.

08:39.490 --> 08:42.559
Celebrating your engagement
with the people that you love.

08:42.626 --> 08:45.294
<i>Don't you think so, Jack?</i>

08:47.665 --> 08:48.731
Yeah. So...

08:48.799 --> 08:50.600
How is, uh, Caleb doing?

08:50.668 --> 08:53.002
Uh, he's getting
better, I think.

08:53.070 --> 08:54.704
I didn't see his truck
at the dude ranch.

08:54.772 --> 08:56.639
- Well...
- It got repossessed.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.942
<i>Yeah, you know,
i'm kinda worried about him.</i>

08:59.009 --> 08:59.943
He looks like hell.

09:00.010 --> 09:03.111
And uh... check this out.

09:04.047 --> 09:06.414
i>He's selling his horse?

09:06.482 --> 09:07.716
<i>What?!</i>

09:08.618 --> 09:10.452
But Caleb loves Shorty!

09:10.519 --> 09:13.254
Oh, this all
sounds very familiar.

09:13.322 --> 09:14.422
<i>Get in a wreck,</i>

09:14.490 --> 09:16.058
sell your horse, and your...

09:16.125 --> 09:17.658
Rodeo career's over.

09:17.726 --> 09:19.627
And he broke up with Ashley.

09:19.695 --> 09:22.196
He might've had a streak
of bad luck,

09:22.263 --> 09:24.198
but he hasn't said a word
about quitting.

09:24.265 --> 09:27.267
So I suggest
we all just calm down

09:27.335 --> 09:29.837
and take a wait-and-see
attitude.

09:29.905 --> 09:31.872
I feel like I've heard that
a few times lately.

09:35.810 --> 09:37.811
Hey, what's with
Grampa and Lisa?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.679
They're acting weird.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.049
Uh, Lou?

09:44.485 --> 09:45.652
If I tell you something,

09:45.720 --> 09:46.820
will you promise
not to freak out?

09:46.887 --> 09:48.454
Yeah, I promise.

09:48.522 --> 09:49.855
What?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.991
Soraya told me
she thought she heard them

09:52.058 --> 09:54.593
talking about...
getting married.

09:57.864 --> 09:58.964
Yeah, right! Come on!

09:59.032 --> 10:00.866
As if Grampa's
gonna do that to me now!

10:00.934 --> 10:02.601
Lou! I'm... Shhhh!

10:03.937 --> 10:05.236
Just think about it.

10:05.303 --> 10:06.504
You guys could have
like a double wedding!

10:06.571 --> 10:07.571
I think it'd be great!

10:07.640 --> 10:08.640
Oh! Save money!

10:08.707 --> 10:09.807
Yeah, get out!

10:13.646 --> 10:15.647
No.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.548
<i>This is a good move
for both New York and Boston.</i>

10:17.616 --> 10:19.316
They need these kind of players
<i>on their team.</i>

10:22.020 --> 10:22.953
Just a sec.

10:24.155 --> 10:26.322
Yeah! Just hold on, would ya?

10:27.959 --> 10:28.792
<i>Mr. Fleming.</i>

10:30.128 --> 10:32.328
I hear you're selling
your horse.

10:32.396 --> 10:33.363
Yeah.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.632
Why, you wanna buy him?

10:35.700 --> 10:36.966
Well, I don't know.

10:37.034 --> 10:39.201
A horse like that
doesn't come along every day.

10:39.269 --> 10:40.536
Well, I trained him myself.

10:40.603 --> 10:42.772
Oh! Really? All by yourself?

10:42.839 --> 10:44.940
For a second,
I was almost interested.

10:45.008 --> 10:46.408
He's the best horse
I ever rode.

10:46.476 --> 10:47.810
So why're you selling him?

10:47.878 --> 10:51.513
Got a sore back?
Gone sour on you?

10:51.581 --> 10:53.481
I got my truck repossessed.

10:53.549 --> 10:54.883
<i>Can't afford to haul
to any rodeos,</i>

10:54.950 --> 10:56.818
can't afford to keep a horse
I'm not using.

10:56.886 --> 10:57.886
So you're broke,
you're not working,

10:57.953 --> 10:59.054
and you're not competing.

10:59.121 --> 11:00.055
Just living here like a king,

11:00.122 --> 11:03.591
free of charge,
at my dude ranch.

11:03.659 --> 11:05.994
How many of these
are you taking?

11:06.929 --> 11:08.762
<i>Just what it says
on the label.</i>

11:08.830 --> 11:10.597
One every four hours
for pain, as needed.

11:10.665 --> 11:12.166
As needed...
That's kind of a grey area,

11:12.233 --> 11:13.633
isn't it?

11:13.702 --> 11:15.069
May need a little less,
may need a little more.

11:15.136 --> 11:16.970
I've got a doctor's prescription
for those.

11:17.038 --> 11:18.572
I used to use that one.

11:18.639 --> 11:19.606
Yeah, well, I'm still hurting.

11:19.674 --> 11:21.341
And I used that one, too.

11:23.311 --> 11:25.511
I'm gonna do you a favour.

11:27.014 --> 11:28.447
I'm gonna start to charge you

11:28.515 --> 11:30.183
the regular rate
for staying here.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.283
What kind of a favour is that?

11:31.351 --> 11:32.719
Well, it's not really a favour.

11:32.786 --> 11:34.486
Consider it more
of an intervention.

11:34.554 --> 11:36.455
Intervention?
What're you talking about?

11:36.523 --> 11:37.724
It's very simple, Caleb.

11:37.791 --> 11:41.159
Here's the deal:
You pay up or you get out.

11:41.227 --> 11:43.195
If I had any money,
I'd still have my truck.

11:43.262 --> 11:44.963
That's your problem,
not my problem.

11:45.031 --> 11:46.698
Deal with it.

11:54.587 --> 11:55.921
<i>No, I did not kick him out.</i>

11:56.238 --> 11:57.772
I just negotiated a new deal.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.174
Come on, Dad,

11:59.241 --> 12:00.341
the whole reason we put Caleb
at the dude ranch

12:00.409 --> 12:01.743
in the first place,

12:01.811 --> 12:03.078
was because he couldn't manage
on his own!

12:03.145 --> 12:04.846
Well, maybe if you stop
babying him.

12:04.914 --> 12:06.014
Oh, I get it, Dad.

12:06.082 --> 12:07.381
Your response to everything -

12:07.449 --> 12:08.449
tough love.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.050
Tough love, that's right.

12:10.118 --> 12:11.585
You know,
when I had my rodeo accident,

12:11.652 --> 12:12.552
and Jack kicked me out,

12:12.620 --> 12:13.821
it was a real wake-up call.

12:13.888 --> 12:15.022
It sure was,

12:15.090 --> 12:16.990
and ten years later
you woke up.

12:18.659 --> 12:20.160
Well, we all deal with things

12:20.228 --> 12:22.395
at our own speed, Jack.

12:31.705 --> 12:33.706
You're a lucky
man there, Caleb.

12:33.774 --> 12:35.208
I'm in no mood for jokes, Jack.

12:35.275 --> 12:36.542
Neither am I.

12:36.610 --> 12:38.410
It seems you've got
the Fleming sisters

12:38.478 --> 12:39.812
on your side.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.312
What're you saying?

12:42.215 --> 12:43.715
You can stay.

12:43.783 --> 12:44.983
But you've gotta start
pulling your weight,

12:45.051 --> 12:46.284
and get back to work.

12:46.352 --> 12:49.087
Well, I'm not ready
for that yet.

12:49.155 --> 12:51.689
The longer you sit around
doin' nothing,

12:51.758 --> 12:53.524
the harder it is
gettin' back in the saddle.

12:53.592 --> 12:55.761
Yeah, well,

12:55.828 --> 12:58.229
I think I'm quitting rodeo.

12:58.296 --> 12:59.864
I'll get a job in the oil patch
or something.

12:59.931 --> 13:01.766
Make some real money.

13:02.768 --> 13:04.668
Well, there's an offer
on the table...

13:04.736 --> 13:07.271
And the meter's running.

13:10.475 --> 13:11.909
Okay.

13:12.710 --> 13:15.511
Maybe I should ease back into it
on a part-time basis.

13:15.579 --> 13:17.213
You start now, full-time,

13:17.281 --> 13:18.581
or you don't start at all.

13:29.659 --> 13:32.594
Promise you won't tell anybody
what happened?

13:32.662 --> 13:34.663
Come on, Mallory,
it's an important job!

13:35.899 --> 13:39.234
So? How'd the tryouts go?

13:39.302 --> 13:41.170
Well, I kind of blew
the pole-bending,

13:41.237 --> 13:43.806
but they let me join anyway.

13:43.873 --> 13:45.439
That's still great!

13:45.507 --> 13:47.809
I mean just being a part
of the rodeo club is awesome.

13:47.876 --> 13:49.143
What do they have you doing?

13:50.412 --> 13:51.512
The rodeo clown.

13:51.579 --> 13:53.815
It's pretty awesome.

14:02.456 --> 14:03.857
Hey, Caleb?

14:03.925 --> 14:05.192
Look, um...

14:06.093 --> 14:07.794
I know it must be difficult
getting back to work

14:07.862 --> 14:09.896
so soon after your accident,

14:09.964 --> 14:13.033
so I thought I could
give you a hand.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.468
Sure. No, I um...

14:16.403 --> 14:17.669
I mean I can give you
a hand with Shorty.

14:17.737 --> 14:20.505
I'll-I'll look after him
for you.

14:20.573 --> 14:22.607
Okay. What's the catch?

14:23.543 --> 14:24.944
Mallory.

14:25.011 --> 14:27.546
She just tried out
for the high school rodeo club.

14:27.613 --> 14:30.149
That's how I got my start too.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.884
As rodeo clown?

14:31.952 --> 14:32.951
Ooh.

14:33.018 --> 14:34.219
Yeah.

14:34.286 --> 14:35.453
She really wants to get
into pole-bending,

14:35.520 --> 14:38.223
but she needs a good horse.

14:38.290 --> 14:39.557
A good rodeo horse.

14:39.624 --> 14:40.825
You mean Shorty?

14:40.893 --> 14:41.960
Yeah.

14:42.027 --> 14:43.361
No, she can't ride Shorty!

14:43.428 --> 14:44.795
- She'd ruin him, are you kidding me?
- Caleb,

14:44.864 --> 14:47.165
you know what? He's for sale,

14:47.233 --> 14:48.499
so you're gonna have
to get used to the idea

14:48.567 --> 14:49.733
of someone else riding him.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.801
It might as well be Mallory.

14:56.140 --> 14:57.806
<i>Hey! Jack!</i>

14:57.875 --> 15:00.809
Jack, I hear you decided,
all on your own,

15:00.878 --> 15:02.511
to let Caleb stay
at the dude ranch...

15:02.579 --> 15:03.812
Free of charge!

15:03.881 --> 15:05.748
If you've got a better idea,
go for it.

15:05.815 --> 15:07.283
But he obviously
looks up to you,

15:07.351 --> 15:09.151
the way he's following
in your footsteps.

15:09.219 --> 15:10.286
Thanks for noticing.

15:10.354 --> 15:11.620
Drinkin' beer for breakfast,

15:11.688 --> 15:12.855
sleeping 'til noon,

15:12.922 --> 15:14.089
talking about quittin'
the rodeo -

15:14.156 --> 15:15.723
that's the only thing
he's good at -

15:15.791 --> 15:17.425
and gettin' a job
working on the oil rigs.

15:17.493 --> 15:20.929
Yeah, pretty big shoes to fill.

15:20.997 --> 15:22.463
<i>Hey, Val.</i>

15:22.531 --> 15:24.699
Hey, Tim. Good to see ya.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.102
<i>Jack, I was gonna call you.</i>

15:27.169 --> 15:29.136
I hear there's news!

15:30.105 --> 15:31.338
You and Lisa?

15:32.274 --> 15:33.640
Me and Lisa what?

15:35.277 --> 15:37.477
Come on!
You've taken the plunge, right?

15:40.882 --> 15:44.151
And come up gasping for air,
by the looks of it.

15:45.953 --> 15:48.121
Well, we were hoping to...

15:48.188 --> 15:50.990
Keep it kinda quiet,
uh, 'til the time is right.

15:51.058 --> 15:53.726
Oh, so it's true! Hmm.

15:54.962 --> 15:56.229
Wow!

15:57.031 --> 15:58.932
And to think
I had to hear it from Ashley

15:58.999 --> 16:02.134
that my closest
and dearest friend is engaged!

16:02.201 --> 16:04.036
I haven't even told
the girls yet.

16:05.771 --> 16:07.205
Yeah, well,

16:07.273 --> 16:08.506
you're doing the right thing
stepping back

16:08.574 --> 16:10.375
and letting Lou shine.

16:10.443 --> 16:11.576
No, I'm...

16:11.644 --> 16:14.179
I'm really happy for you, Jack.

16:14.247 --> 16:15.480
I guess I'm having
a little trouble

16:15.548 --> 16:18.215
imagining Lisa
living at your place.

16:18.283 --> 16:20.584
Talk about downsizing!

16:20.652 --> 16:23.554
That'll be quite
a lifestyle change, huh?

16:23.621 --> 16:25.122
For both of you.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.094
Lisa...

16:30.162 --> 16:31.728
Great gal.

16:31.796 --> 16:33.529
Good looking.

16:33.597 --> 16:35.465
And at your age?

16:35.532 --> 16:37.334
Getting married.

16:38.269 --> 16:40.736
What were you thinking?

16:42.273 --> 16:43.773
Well, I kinda wasn't thinking,

16:43.841 --> 16:46.176
I was more like yelling.

16:46.243 --> 16:48.678
Well, I wasn't yelling...

16:48.745 --> 16:50.679
You know what?
It's gonna be just fine!

16:50.746 --> 16:52.547
Sounds like true love.

16:53.450 --> 16:56.751
It's probably your enthusiasm
that swept her off her feet.

17:05.694 --> 17:08.128
You know, it's actually
looking pretty good.

17:08.196 --> 17:09.964
Yeah, I got some work to do
on the brakes tonight,

17:10.031 --> 17:13.666
and then I'm putting on
a new exhaust system.

17:13.734 --> 17:15.069
You know,
you're gonna have to let me

17:15.137 --> 17:16.770
take it out for a ride
some time.

17:16.838 --> 17:18.339
No way.

17:18.406 --> 17:19.507
Hey! Don't touch!

17:19.574 --> 17:20.674
Whoa! All right?!

17:20.742 --> 17:23.109
Jeez, what's your problem, man?

17:23.176 --> 17:25.078
Let's say I wanted
to borrow your hat.

17:25.146 --> 17:26.512
No!

17:26.579 --> 17:29.682
A man's hat is kinda like
his girl, you know?

17:29.750 --> 17:32.252
Same deal with my motorcycle.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.787
So I guess you heard about me
and Ashley, huh?

17:34.855 --> 17:36.823
Yeah.

17:36.891 --> 17:38.190
Least you've still got
your hat, right?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.659
Yes I do.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.301
Mallory, you have a death grip
on your reins.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.505
He's going too fast!

17:52.572 --> 17:53.571
He has to go fast,

17:53.639 --> 17:55.173
<i>it's a speed event!</i>

17:55.241 --> 17:57.375
<i>Whoa!</i>

17:57.443 --> 17:58.809
Agh! Ow!

17:58.877 --> 17:59.977
<i>Mallory!</i>

18:02.781 --> 18:04.582
Don't get up, are you okay?

18:04.650 --> 18:06.451
I guess.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.886
Why did he stop so fast?

18:08.954 --> 18:10.887
Because you don't know
what you're doing.

18:11.789 --> 18:12.889
<i>She's gonna ruin him!</i>

18:12.957 --> 18:13.924
She keeps yanking on his mouth,

18:13.991 --> 18:14.891
he's gonna start rearing up,

18:14.959 --> 18:16.260
and if that happens-

18:16.327 --> 18:17.794
Okay. If you're so concerned
about Shorty,

18:17.862 --> 18:21.665
why don't you ride him
and show her yourself?

18:22.534 --> 18:24.268
How do you expect me
to do that?

18:24.335 --> 18:26.635
Ow. He's right!

18:26.703 --> 18:28.671
We should just forget
about the whole thing.

18:28.738 --> 18:29.805
Uh, no!

18:29.873 --> 18:30.806
You know what
you're supposed to do

18:30.874 --> 18:32.341
when you fall off a horse?!

18:32.409 --> 18:33.609
Quit?

18:33.677 --> 18:35.244
Caleb quit.

18:36.146 --> 18:37.713
Yeah.

18:37.781 --> 18:40.916
And look how that worked out
for him.

18:44.019 --> 18:45.887
He's selling Shorty,
I don't believe it.

18:45.955 --> 18:48.123
Maybe it's another one
of those rodeo superstitions.

18:48.191 --> 18:49.558
Have a wreck,
sell your horse...

18:49.625 --> 18:51.193
Oh, and blame your girlfriend
for everything.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.961
Have you talked to him at all?

18:53.028 --> 18:54.463
Like I need the aggravation?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.164
So you're totally over him?

18:56.232 --> 18:57.431
Yup!

18:57.499 --> 18:59.266
Besides,
he should apologize to me

18:59.334 --> 19:01.735
for being such a jerk!

19:04.906 --> 19:06.873
You know,
you're totally right,

19:06.941 --> 19:08.875
it's just maybe you should
make the first move.

19:08.943 --> 19:10.444
You mean like call him?

19:10.512 --> 19:12.980
Yeah. You know,
just see if he's okay?

19:13.047 --> 19:14.747
And pretend I care.

19:14.815 --> 19:16.516
Yeah. Okay, why not?

19:22.956 --> 19:25.191
<i>The number you have reached
is not in service.</i>

19:25.259 --> 19:26.792
<i>Please check the number
and try your call again.</i>

19:26.860 --> 19:29.761
Great.

19:49.214 --> 19:50.248
Ash.

19:51.216 --> 19:52.283
Hey.

19:53.919 --> 19:55.586
Are you busy?

20:06.631 --> 20:08.699
Look, um...

20:08.767 --> 20:11.401
I'm sorry about
the no-girlfriends-

20:11.469 --> 20:12.836
on-the-circuit thing.

20:12.904 --> 20:16.840
I... guess I thought
it was about the partying,

20:16.908 --> 20:19.008
and not the superstition.

20:19.076 --> 20:21.477
It's not a superstition, Ash.

20:21.545 --> 20:23.245
It's obviously true.
I mean, look what happened.

20:23.313 --> 20:25.214
You didn't even know I was there
when it happened!

20:25.282 --> 20:28.084
That just proves it's true!

20:29.653 --> 20:32.288
You're still taking these?

20:32.355 --> 20:33.656
Don't start!

20:33.723 --> 20:34.656
If you're gonna rag on me
about the pills,

20:34.724 --> 20:36.424
I've got a doctor's
prescription!

20:36.492 --> 20:37.693
Okay!

20:37.760 --> 20:39.027
Okay,
who cares about the pills!

20:39.095 --> 20:41.196
You do, obviously.

20:42.631 --> 20:44.299
So what,

20:44.366 --> 20:47.002
now you're gonna tell
everyone about 'em?

20:47.070 --> 20:48.603
There's beer over there.

20:48.671 --> 20:51.806
Don't forget to mention
that too, huh?

20:51.873 --> 20:53.273
This is my life!

20:55.077 --> 20:57.344
Just leave me alone, okay?

20:59.447 --> 21:00.514
Okay.

21:01.249 --> 21:03.584
I'll leave you alone.

21:08.389 --> 21:09.756
Ungh!

21:23.136 --> 21:24.403
Okay.

21:24.471 --> 21:25.671
I don't believe
I'm gonna say this,

21:25.739 --> 21:26.805
but I actually think
it's a good thing

21:26.873 --> 21:28.307
that we waited
to tell everyone,

21:28.375 --> 21:32.678
because we need to sort out
some of the details.

21:32.746 --> 21:33.946
Well...

21:34.715 --> 21:37.416
That ship might've
already sailed.

21:37.484 --> 21:38.817
Oh.

21:38.885 --> 21:40.285
<i>So you did tell the girls?</i>

21:40.353 --> 21:42.320
<i>No, no...</i>

21:43.289 --> 21:44.556
<i>It's Val,</i>

21:44.624 --> 21:46.658
somehow she already knows.

21:46.726 --> 21:48.160
<i>You know what?</i>

21:48.228 --> 21:49.461
<i>If Val knows,
then it's just a matter of time</i>

21:49.528 --> 21:51.163
before absolutely
everybody knows.

21:51.231 --> 21:53.232
Well, not everybody.

21:54.167 --> 21:56.500
'Cept... maybe Tim.

21:57.970 --> 22:00.738
Tim? Yeah, that's why...

22:00.806 --> 22:04.341
<i>I think I've got to tell
Lou and Amy now.</i>

22:04.409 --> 22:05.609
<i>Yes.</i>

22:06.478 --> 22:08.813
But I wanna...
I wanna tell them together.

22:08.881 --> 22:09.914
Okay?

22:12.349 --> 22:13.383
Okay.

22:14.385 --> 22:15.685
Oh my God!

22:15.753 --> 22:16.820
What?

22:16.888 --> 22:18.088
Like talk about timing!

22:18.156 --> 22:19.890
- Lou-
- Well, couldn't they have just waited?!

22:19.957 --> 22:21.624
What difference
would it even make to them?

22:21.692 --> 22:22.793
What are you talking about?

22:22.860 --> 22:26.263
Grampa and Lisa
have some big news!

22:26.330 --> 22:27.529
Like they're getting married.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.999
What else could it be?!

22:30.066 --> 22:31.466
Wow!

22:31.534 --> 22:32.567
Um...

22:34.604 --> 22:38.307
I guess I'm supposed
to be happy, right?

22:39.242 --> 22:40.676
It just feels like
everyone's getting married

22:40.743 --> 22:42.678
and moving away.

22:42.745 --> 22:44.312
Amy,

22:44.379 --> 22:47.248
it's not gonna be
like that, okay?

22:47.316 --> 22:48.249
I promise.

22:48.317 --> 22:50.418
You can't promise that.

22:50.485 --> 22:53.254
Uh, things aren't gonna be
the same here.

22:53.322 --> 22:55.256
Look. First thing tomorrow,

22:55.324 --> 22:57.959
we'll just ask Grampa
what's going on,

22:58.027 --> 22:59.659
okay?

22:59.727 --> 23:00.794
All right.

23:03.331 --> 23:05.265
Why would he do this to me?!

23:05.333 --> 23:06.266
I'm the one
who's getting married!

23:06.334 --> 23:07.400
<i>Lou!</i>

23:08.303 --> 23:09.369
Sorry.

23:17.344 --> 23:18.377
Damn.

23:41.334 --> 23:42.400
Ugh! Damn!

24:18.269 --> 24:19.635
Oh jeez!

24:19.703 --> 24:20.403
Ungh!

24:31.981 --> 24:33.015
Ungh! Oh...

24:35.718 --> 24:36.785
No...

24:38.387 --> 24:40.288
Oh damn!

24:48.103 --> 24:49.903
Uh, hey Grampa?

24:50.122 --> 24:52.723
Is there anything
you need to tell us?

24:54.760 --> 24:57.128
As a matter of fact, there is.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.030
<i>Uh...</i>

25:00.098 --> 25:02.832
Lisa has offered
to make dinner tonight.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.067
Her specialty...

25:04.135 --> 25:06.203
Uh, beef bourguignonne.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.105
That's beef stew, in French.

25:08.172 --> 25:09.839
<i>I'm just heading to town now</i>

25:09.908 --> 25:11.141
<i>to pick up
all the stuff she needs,</i>

25:11.209 --> 25:13.643
if I can get it all
into my truck.

25:13.711 --> 25:15.012
Well, I'm picking up
an exhaust system in town.

25:15.079 --> 25:16.245
I can give you a hand,
if you like.

25:16.313 --> 25:17.579
Now speaking of hands,

25:17.647 --> 25:19.715
has anybody seen Caleb
this morning?

25:19.783 --> 25:21.884
Isn't he supposed
to be working here?

25:26.390 --> 25:27.823
Boeuf bourguignonne?

25:27.891 --> 25:29.558
Likely story.

25:34.430 --> 25:35.763
Hey, Caleb?!

25:40.069 --> 25:41.669
Caleb, are you in there?

25:41.737 --> 25:43.271
<i>Yeah!</i>

25:43.339 --> 25:44.472
<i>Yeah...</i>

25:48.310 --> 25:49.509
What happened?

25:49.577 --> 25:50.811
Nothing.

25:52.314 --> 25:53.547
I had to go see Ashley.

25:53.614 --> 25:54.648
How the hell else
was I supposed to get there

25:54.715 --> 25:55.649
without my truck?

25:55.716 --> 25:57.751
What are you talking about?

25:57.819 --> 25:59.954
You don't know.

26:00.021 --> 26:01.055
Where's Ty?

26:01.122 --> 26:02.222
Uh...

26:02.290 --> 26:05.058
Ty is in town with Grampa.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.794
Look,
I borrowed his motorcycle.

26:07.862 --> 26:10.797
You borrowed it?
Without asking?

26:10.865 --> 26:13.467
I kinda went into the ditch.

26:13.534 --> 26:15.368
It took me half the night
to wheel it back here.

26:15.436 --> 26:17.637
Caleb, you know how much
that motorcycle means to him!

26:17.705 --> 26:19.038
I know!

26:19.106 --> 26:20.239
<i>I wasn't thinking clearly,
all right?</i>

26:20.307 --> 26:21.406
I'll pay for everything,
I promise.

26:21.475 --> 26:22.875
Just please,

26:22.943 --> 26:24.977
you gotta help me
square things over with Ty.

26:25.044 --> 26:26.311
No, I'm not getting involved
in this.

26:26.379 --> 26:28.046
<i>Look, Amy, wait!</i>

26:30.350 --> 26:32.751
You want me to work
with Mallory and Shorty?

26:32.819 --> 26:34.687
I will, on one condition.

26:34.754 --> 26:37.288
I stop Ty from killing you?

26:37.356 --> 26:38.656
Please, just...

26:38.724 --> 26:39.991
Tell him it was all
a misunderstanding.

26:40.058 --> 26:42.293
He'll listen to you.

26:43.428 --> 26:45.029
<i>Hello!</i>

26:46.699 --> 26:47.866
Hi! Hey.

26:47.933 --> 26:50.502
You don't mind, do you?

26:50.569 --> 26:51.703
What's all this?

26:51.770 --> 26:53.303
Um...

26:53.371 --> 26:54.638
I wanted to surprise Jack

26:54.706 --> 26:56.239
with his favourite
Saskatoon berry pie!

26:56.307 --> 26:57.908
Huh.

26:57.976 --> 26:59.610
Boeuf bourguignonne,

26:59.677 --> 27:01.678
Saskatoon berry pie...

27:01.746 --> 27:03.046
What's the occasion?

27:03.114 --> 27:04.781
Nothing, just uh...

27:05.750 --> 27:07.484
Just a nice dinner...

27:07.552 --> 27:09.218
While we still can.

27:10.186 --> 27:11.120
I'm sure Jack
hasn't mentioned it,

27:11.187 --> 27:12.555
but I think...

27:12.623 --> 27:13.623
I think he's having a bit
of a hard time with the idea

27:13.690 --> 27:15.024
that you're getting married
to Peter,

27:15.091 --> 27:17.092
and then you're not gonna
be here any more.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.895
Yeah. Me too.

27:18.962 --> 27:21.196
I mean, I'm crazy about Peter,

27:21.264 --> 27:22.865
but I'm not so crazy

27:22.933 --> 27:24.666
about the "where
we're gonna live" part.

27:24.734 --> 27:27.769
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.

27:27.837 --> 27:29.404
I've lived at Fairfield
my whole life

27:29.471 --> 27:30.906
and...

27:32.341 --> 27:33.842
And?

27:33.910 --> 27:35.043
And I...

27:35.110 --> 27:37.111
And I... shoot!

27:37.179 --> 27:38.914
Forgot my flour sifter.

27:38.981 --> 27:41.214
You have one, right?

27:42.717 --> 27:45.753
<i>Mallory, what're
you doing up there?!</i>

27:45.820 --> 27:48.321
Come on,
you gotta cut it closer.

27:48.389 --> 27:49.557
Move it, Mallory!

27:49.624 --> 27:50.891
Caleb!

27:51.259 --> 27:53.293
She's holding him back,
she's gotta let him run.

27:53.361 --> 27:55.195
Yeah, well,
she's just scared.

27:55.263 --> 27:56.396
<i>She doesn't wanna go too fast.</i>

27:56.464 --> 27:57.730
Fast? She's barely moving.

27:57.798 --> 27:59.098
That's because she's afraid.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.700
You know maybe you could
just talk to her,

28:00.768 --> 28:02.334
<i>instead of yelling at her?</i>

28:02.402 --> 28:04.370
Just build up her confidence.

28:07.307 --> 28:09.776
I know. That sucked.

28:11.579 --> 28:12.778
You're not a bad rider,
Mallory.

28:12.845 --> 28:14.813
But you gotta loosen up
on the reins,

28:14.881 --> 28:16.548
let Shorty do his job.

28:16.616 --> 28:17.783
Yeah, right. If I let him go,

28:17.850 --> 28:19.117
how am I supposed
to control him?

28:19.185 --> 28:20.385
You don't have to.

28:21.220 --> 28:22.387
Hell, he knows
what he's doing out there

28:22.455 --> 28:24.289
better than you do.

28:24.356 --> 28:25.390
Yeah, a little more time

28:25.458 --> 28:27.158
and you two'll be a real team.

28:31.563 --> 28:32.964
Oh!

28:33.031 --> 28:35.265
<i>Hi, Lisa. I didn't expect
to see you here.</i>

28:35.333 --> 28:36.533
Hi.

28:36.602 --> 28:37.835
But then again,

28:37.903 --> 28:39.269
now that you're engaged,
I guess...

28:41.172 --> 28:42.439
Oh...

28:42.507 --> 28:44.441
Well, I guess it's true
what they say.

28:44.509 --> 28:45.541
Good news travels fast.

28:45.610 --> 28:46.576
Oh.

28:46.644 --> 28:47.677
Val, it'd be great

28:47.745 --> 28:48.544
if you could keep that
under wraps

28:48.613 --> 28:50.313
for a little bit longer.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.881
Sure.

28:51.949 --> 28:53.182
But, you know,
as I said to Jack,

28:53.250 --> 28:55.085
I'm just...

28:55.152 --> 28:57.988
Well, I'm just...
So happy for both of you.

28:59.189 --> 29:00.189
And we're gonna be neighbours.

29:00.257 --> 29:01.624
Neighbours?

29:01.658 --> 29:03.626
I don't...

29:03.693 --> 29:05.861
I don't know, I don't think so.

29:05.929 --> 29:09.164
So you'll be living
at Fairfield then?

29:09.232 --> 29:10.432
<i>Wow.</i>

29:11.167 --> 29:13.068
Jack did hit the jackpot,
didn't he?

29:13.136 --> 29:14.837
<i>No.</i>

29:15.404 --> 29:16.938
No, Lisa, I'm-I'm sorry.

29:17.006 --> 29:18.339
I'm just kidding.

29:18.406 --> 29:20.008
I'm sure you'll have
an ironclad pre-nup.

29:20.075 --> 29:21.242
You know, just in case...

29:21.309 --> 29:23.210
It doesn't work out,
or something.

29:23.278 --> 29:24.779
Right?

29:24.847 --> 29:26.080
You know, I would love to chat,

29:26.148 --> 29:29.350
um, but I really do have
a lot to do, Val.

29:29.417 --> 29:31.218
Sure, another time.
I'll just leave the pie.

29:31.286 --> 29:32.919
No, I actually made dessert,

29:32.987 --> 29:35.555
so you can probably
take that with you.

29:35.623 --> 29:37.858
Jack loves Rosalita's
Saskatoon berry pie.

29:37.925 --> 29:39.592
<i>He waits for it every year.</i>

29:39.661 --> 29:41.628
And you know what I always say?

29:41.696 --> 29:43.363
If a man asks for pie,

29:43.430 --> 29:44.898
I like to give it to him.

29:45.867 --> 29:46.933
A la mode.

29:55.275 --> 29:56.542
<i>Oh!</i>

29:56.609 --> 29:58.177
Look at it.

29:59.146 --> 30:00.880
What?! Oh, no!

30:01.381 --> 30:02.048
Oh, no!

30:06.451 --> 30:07.686
Poop!

30:07.753 --> 30:09.154
Oh, shoot!

30:23.868 --> 30:25.536
Remember our deal.

30:25.604 --> 30:27.871
Right, I'm on it.

30:27.939 --> 30:29.173
Hey, Ty?

30:30.309 --> 30:32.743
<i>Ty, can I talk to you?</i>

30:33.679 --> 30:34.978
<i>He's really really sorry,</i>

30:35.046 --> 30:38.515
<i>and he promises
to pay for everything.</i>

30:44.522 --> 30:45.622
Ty!

30:46.524 --> 30:48.692
Ty! You should've seen me.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.026
<i>Whoa! Wait!</i>

30:50.094 --> 30:51.528
Look, man,
I know it was a mistake.

30:51.596 --> 30:52.596
I'm sorry, I should've asked.

30:52.663 --> 30:53.529
You did ask.

30:53.597 --> 30:55.698
Ungh!

30:57.601 --> 30:58.667
And I said no!

31:15.894 --> 31:17.262
You're lucky
he only hit you once,

31:17.330 --> 31:18.796
and didn't kick you
when you were down.

31:18.864 --> 31:20.198
Yeah, well,

31:20.266 --> 31:22.100
maybe he remembered
I just got out of the hospital.

31:22.168 --> 31:23.301
<i>What do you not get,
Caleb?</i>

31:23.369 --> 31:24.702
Everybody's been
bending over backwards

31:24.770 --> 31:26.438
to help you out!

31:26.505 --> 31:27.572
<i>How long do you think
you can play the sympathy card</i>

31:27.639 --> 31:29.874
before you're out of here?

31:30.809 --> 31:31.942
Where are they?

31:32.010 --> 31:32.943
Where are what?

31:33.979 --> 31:35.045
Hey...

31:36.714 --> 31:38.015
Aspirin.

31:38.083 --> 31:40.117
Okay, I gotta go.

31:44.189 --> 31:45.422
Okay...

31:46.191 --> 31:47.790
I understand why
you're mad at Caleb.

31:47.858 --> 31:48.992
I do, okay?

31:49.059 --> 31:52.528
It's just...
Your timing's a little off.

31:52.596 --> 31:54.197
He wrecked my bike.

31:54.264 --> 31:55.431
You're giving the guy
way too big a break.

31:55.499 --> 31:56.832
You know that whole
high school rodeo thing

31:56.900 --> 31:58.067
with Mallory and his horse?

31:58.135 --> 31:58.834
Do you know how long
that took me

31:58.902 --> 31:59.935
to get him to do it?

32:00.004 --> 32:01.004
Yeah, 'cause it was
something more

32:01.071 --> 32:02.405
than sitting around
and complaining.

32:02.473 --> 32:04.806
Ty, this is serious!
He's not making this up.

32:04.874 --> 32:06.508
Come on, Amy!

32:06.575 --> 32:08.377
How could you miss this

32:08.444 --> 32:11.846
after what happened
with your dad?

32:17.220 --> 32:20.721
I knew there was something
going on with him.

32:20.788 --> 32:23.590
I've seen this before,
and so have you.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.068
That was for dinner.

32:34.136 --> 32:35.235
I just couldn't help it,

32:35.302 --> 32:37.870
it looked so good
sitting there.

32:37.938 --> 32:39.439
And...

32:39.507 --> 32:40.606
As it turns out,

32:40.674 --> 32:43.043
it's the best damn pie
I've ever had.

32:43.977 --> 32:46.979
Is it better than Rosalita's?

32:48.282 --> 32:51.250
Well, uh... at least as good.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.817
I didn't bake it.

32:52.885 --> 32:55.787
Val brought it over for you.

32:56.822 --> 32:58.057
So it is Rosalita's.

32:58.124 --> 32:59.224
Mm-hmm.

33:01.027 --> 33:02.361
Well, to be perfectly honest
with you,

33:02.429 --> 33:04.729
it's...
It's not one of her best.

33:05.932 --> 33:08.666
If we're gonna be honest...

33:08.733 --> 33:12.036
I think there's something
I need to say.

33:12.104 --> 33:13.671
It's just...

33:15.607 --> 33:20.711
I'm-I'm wondering if maybe
we're making a mistake.

33:20.779 --> 33:23.047
Does this have something
to do with Val?

33:23.114 --> 33:24.414
Did she say something?

33:24.482 --> 33:26.749
Oh, she said plenty.

33:28.319 --> 33:29.686
But it-it...

33:30.621 --> 33:34.757
It doesn't change
the way that I'm feeling.

33:39.596 --> 33:42.331
You know I love you, Lisa.

33:44.934 --> 33:49.004
And I probably don't
show you that enough.

33:52.175 --> 33:53.976
I love you too.

33:56.612 --> 33:57.912
I love...

33:59.582 --> 34:01.149
I love us together.

34:01.217 --> 34:02.450
So do I.

34:03.352 --> 34:07.054
I love the life
that we have together.

34:24.071 --> 34:26.473
So what happened to you? Hmm?

34:26.541 --> 34:28.373
You fall on your face?

34:28.442 --> 34:29.775
<i>You finally hit rock bottom?</i>

34:29.842 --> 34:32.277
Listen, Mr. Fleming,

34:32.346 --> 34:33.379
I know you own the place,

34:33.447 --> 34:34.880
but you need to knock.

34:34.947 --> 34:35.848
<i>I'm busy.</i>

34:35.915 --> 34:37.949
Yeah, I can see that.

34:38.018 --> 34:39.685
Wallowing in self-pity.

34:39.753 --> 34:41.154
Okay.

34:41.221 --> 34:42.255
You need to leave.

34:42.322 --> 34:44.422
Happens all the time.

34:44.489 --> 34:46.690
Cowboy gets wracked up,
loses his nerve.

34:46.759 --> 34:48.393
You saying I'm a coward?

34:48.460 --> 34:49.594
I've ridden bareback,

34:49.661 --> 34:50.995
saddled broncs,
wrestled steers.

34:51.063 --> 34:52.330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:52.398 --> 34:54.065
Yeah. So what?

34:54.132 --> 34:55.933
You know, it doesn't take guts

34:56.001 --> 34:59.003
to be clueless
about what could happen.

34:59.071 --> 35:00.604
It's just being
young and stupid.

35:00.672 --> 35:01.605
I'm warning you.

35:01.673 --> 35:02.973
I'm warning you!

35:03.041 --> 35:05.409
I'm talking, shut up!

35:07.879 --> 35:12.316
I won more buckles
than you can probably count.

35:12.384 --> 35:15.052
I know what
I'm talking about, Caleb.

35:15.119 --> 35:16.752
You're having trouble
sleeping at night, right?

35:16.820 --> 35:18.821
Wake up sweating?

35:20.191 --> 35:24.126
Walk down the street,
heart starts beating,

35:24.195 --> 35:25.195
can't breathe.

35:26.697 --> 35:29.732
It's anxiety caused by these.

35:30.967 --> 35:32.867
I used to call it the dread.

35:32.935 --> 35:34.269
Yeah?

35:34.337 --> 35:37.472
Well, I never gave it a name.

35:38.441 --> 35:40.576
But every time I think
about getting on a horse,

35:40.643 --> 35:43.745
sure, I'd like to go back
to being young and stupid.

35:43.813 --> 35:45.314
<i>Stop thinking about it.</i>

35:45.381 --> 35:46.815
Hmm... I tried that -

35:46.882 --> 35:49.217
not thinking about it any more.

35:49.284 --> 35:51.352
Pills, alcohol,

35:51.420 --> 35:52.886
whatever... works.

35:55.090 --> 35:57.358
There's something
that works better,

35:57.426 --> 35:59.126
except it took me years
to figure it out.

35:59.194 --> 36:01.028
So, what?

36:01.096 --> 36:02.597
Now you're gonna give me
a twelve-step pep talk?

36:02.664 --> 36:05.865
I'm gonna give you
a one-step pep talk.

36:05.933 --> 36:07.334
You stop taking these pills,

36:07.401 --> 36:08.768
you get back on your horse,

36:08.836 --> 36:10.570
and you get back to doing
the thing that you do best.

36:10.638 --> 36:12.672
Well, that's three steps
and counting, ain't it?

36:16.076 --> 36:18.077
Cut the crap!

36:19.247 --> 36:21.748
I know exactly where you are,

36:21.815 --> 36:24.984
and there's a very heavy
price to pay.

36:25.052 --> 36:28.020
I had a wife who loved me,

36:28.956 --> 36:30.289
who tried to help me.

36:30.357 --> 36:31.624
I had a family.

36:31.691 --> 36:34.426
I had two beautiful
little girls.

36:34.494 --> 36:36.228
I had a life,

36:37.130 --> 36:38.797
and I was blind,

36:38.865 --> 36:40.031
and it all slipped away.

36:40.099 --> 36:41.532
Okay.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.934
- Okay, I get it.
- No, I don't think you do,

36:43.002 --> 36:45.003
and you have to!

36:45.071 --> 36:48.206
You gotta get it soon, Caleb.

36:48.274 --> 36:51.743
Because if you make
the same mistakes that I made,

36:51.810 --> 36:54.611
with all of these people around
that love you

36:54.679 --> 36:57.414
and are trying to help you,

36:57.482 --> 37:00.818
you're gonna slip
right through the cracks.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.052
And there'll be nobody to blame
but yourself.

37:30.180 --> 37:31.879
So, Grampa,

37:32.782 --> 37:33.715
we can't take it any more.

37:33.783 --> 37:34.949
Is-is it true?

37:35.017 --> 37:36.584
Are you and Lisa
getting married?

37:39.789 --> 37:43.325
Well, that's
kind of a long story.

37:43.392 --> 37:44.926
Oh my God!

37:44.993 --> 37:46.294
A long story
about how you forgot

37:46.362 --> 37:47.761
that I'm the one
who's getting married?!

37:47.829 --> 37:50.464
Just calm down, Lou.

37:50.532 --> 37:53.634
Yes, I did propose to Lisa-

37:53.702 --> 37:54.735
I knew it!

37:54.803 --> 37:56.102
I knew it! See, I told you!

37:56.170 --> 37:57.971
<i>And she did say yes...</i>

37:58.039 --> 37:59.406
So you guys just take

37:59.474 --> 38:00.741
one of the most important
moments of my life

38:00.809 --> 38:02.275
and hijack it from me?!

38:02.344 --> 38:05.611
But, when we thought about it,

38:05.679 --> 38:11.083
we realized that we were happy
with the way things are.

38:12.185 --> 38:13.252
So...

38:15.088 --> 38:17.557
So no,
we're not getting married.

38:17.624 --> 38:18.725
Oh.

38:20.593 --> 38:24.596
And we didn't want
to steal your thunder.

38:26.098 --> 38:27.165
Oh.

38:30.202 --> 38:33.238
Well then.

38:33.305 --> 38:35.706
Uh, how about a toast?

38:45.149 --> 38:47.251
Right, the toast.
Uh, how about a toast...

38:48.687 --> 38:50.488
To Jack and Lisa,

38:51.390 --> 38:54.224
and uh... to things
staying the same.

38:55.726 --> 38:56.793
The same.

38:56.861 --> 38:57.794
<i>The same.</i>

38:57.862 --> 38:58.929
Cheers!

39:33.762 --> 39:36.164
Maybe I'm just not
a good enough rider.

39:36.232 --> 39:38.133
No one likes to fall off
a horse, Mallory.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.467
But it's getting back on

39:39.535 --> 39:41.302
that separates the winners
from the losers.

39:41.369 --> 39:43.037
I wish I could show you, but...

39:43.104 --> 39:44.905
I can't ride Shorty
the way Caleb can.

39:44.973 --> 39:46.807
<i>Okay, you need
a specific style of riding</i>

39:46.874 --> 39:48.175
<i>for timed events.</i>

39:48.243 --> 39:49.176
You've gotta just cowboy up,

39:49.244 --> 39:50.444
and let 'em run.

39:50.511 --> 39:53.080
And I know that takes
lot of guts, okay?

39:53.148 --> 39:54.748
Especially coming off
a big fall

39:54.816 --> 39:56.916
- like you just had-
- it wasn't a bad fall, Amy.

39:56.984 --> 39:58.551
I didn't even get hurt.

39:58.618 --> 40:00.453
She's not talking about you,
Mallory.

40:01.355 --> 40:03.957
Oh, I get it.
Reverse psychology.

40:04.024 --> 40:05.425
Or sports psychology.

40:05.492 --> 40:07.160
Or reverse sports psychology.

40:07.227 --> 40:08.561
Or blackmail.

40:16.836 --> 40:18.337
Okay.

40:18.404 --> 40:20.939
I'll get on the damn horse.

40:21.007 --> 40:22.907
But you gotta promise
not to tell anyone.

40:22.976 --> 40:25.978
Some cowboys figure
pole-bending

40:26.045 --> 40:29.280
is, uh, more
of a Little Britches event.

40:32.351 --> 40:33.985
Caleb...

40:34.052 --> 40:35.486
Get on the horse.

40:38.156 --> 40:39.190
Okay.

40:42.594 --> 40:43.961
Uh...

40:44.028 --> 40:45.761
Yeah, I'll give you a leg up.
Yeah, a leg up.

40:45.829 --> 40:48.031
All right. One, two, three!

40:50.034 --> 40:51.401
See?

40:51.469 --> 40:53.470
Nothing to it.

40:53.537 --> 40:55.271
Now get out of my way.

40:57.074 --> 40:58.108
Whoo!

40:58.175 --> 40:59.642
<i>Yeah, Caleb!</i>

40:59.710 --> 41:02.111
- Come on, Caleb!
- Yeah, Caleb!

41:04.514 --> 41:05.547
Bring him back,
bring him back now!

41:05.615 --> 41:07.983
<i>Whoa, whooo!</i>

41:10.387 --> 41:12.187
Yeah, Caleb!

41:18.093 --> 41:19.293
<i>Yeah!</i>

41:19.361 --> 41:20.428
Whooo!

41:25.110 --> 41:27.545
<i>That's not your horse.</i>

41:27.612 --> 41:29.713
His name's Shorty.

41:29.781 --> 41:31.115
He's an actual rodeo horse.

41:31.183 --> 41:33.650
My friend Caleb's
a professional cowboy.

41:33.717 --> 41:35.285
And he
lets you ride him?

41:35.353 --> 41:38.121
Uh yeah, he's pretty
much my personal trainer.

41:49.266 --> 41:51.667
Man, it was those damn pills,

41:51.734 --> 41:52.835
they were really messing
with my head.

41:52.902 --> 41:55.838
But you should know
I quit taking 'em.

41:55.905 --> 41:59.075
I've spent half my life
listening to that story.

41:59.142 --> 42:01.344
Yeah, well, it's true.

42:01.411 --> 42:02.945
I mean...

42:03.013 --> 42:04.312
<i>Even pole-bending,
it might be a girls' sport,</i>

42:04.380 --> 42:08.149
but still,
it's split-second timing.

42:08.217 --> 42:09.317
I can't even show Mallory
how it's done

42:09.385 --> 42:11.853
if I don't have a clear head.

42:16.459 --> 42:18.026
Hand me that screwdriver?

42:18.094 --> 42:19.194
Okay.

42:21.496 --> 42:22.562
Thanks.

42:25.233 --> 42:26.333
But you should know,

42:26.401 --> 42:27.401
I never would've spun out
on that turn

42:27.469 --> 42:30.570
if you'd gotten
the brakes right.

42:30.638 --> 42:31.805
If you knew anything
about motorcycles,

42:31.873 --> 42:33.440
you wouldn't have braked
on a turn.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.078
Hey, that's...

42:51.091 --> 42:52.457
My truck!

42:53.393 --> 42:55.427
How'd you get it back
from the repo man?

42:55.495 --> 42:58.296
All it took was some money.

42:59.399 --> 43:01.066
Forget it, Ash.

43:01.134 --> 43:02.234
I mean it's real generous
and all,

43:02.301 --> 43:04.169
but... you know I can't accept.

43:04.237 --> 43:06.238
I'm not that generous.

43:06.305 --> 43:07.472
When you get back
on the circuit,

43:07.540 --> 43:08.972
you can pay me back.

43:09.041 --> 43:12.376
Yeah, well,
that might be a while yet.

43:12.444 --> 43:14.412
Well, that's okay.

43:14.479 --> 43:16.380
I won't charge interest.

43:16.448 --> 43:17.948

43:18.016 --> 43:20.084

43:39.603 --> 43:41.870
Okay, so maybe Grampa
isn't getting married.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.940
<i>But one way or another,</i>

43:45.007 --> 43:47.543
<i>things are gonna change
around here.</i>

43:47.610 --> 43:49.578
And, I don't know...

43:49.645 --> 43:51.112
I mean, Lou's leaving.

43:51.180 --> 43:52.346
That's for sure, right?

43:52.414 --> 43:53.848
And I'm graduating high school,

43:53.916 --> 43:55.817
and you're going off
to college, and...

43:55.885 --> 43:57.719
Those are all good things, Amy.

43:57.787 --> 44:00.589
How come it doesn't feel
like it?

44:04.459 --> 44:06.393
Amy...

44:06.461 --> 44:08.462
Even if all those things
do happen,
