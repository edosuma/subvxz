00:02.540 --> 00:03.960
GRACE: Previously on
The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:03.960 --> 00:05.250
So I woke up Grace and
asked her to come in here,

00:05.250 --> 00:06.210
and then I'll tell
her about Jack.

00:06.210 --> 00:07.420
He's not gonna die, is he?

00:07.420 --> 00:09.880
You seem to be
in a good mood.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.380
My dad got
remarried yesterday.

00:11.380 --> 00:13.460
What are you doing here?
I slept over with Anne.

00:13.460 --> 00:14.790
Did you know
that marriages
are public record?

00:14.790 --> 00:16.380
You're not married,
are you?

00:16.380 --> 00:18.120
After the baby is born,

00:18.120 --> 00:19.120
I'm going to be going
back home to my family,

00:19.120 --> 00:21.420
I'm transferring.

00:21.420 --> 00:22.380
And so are my friends.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.250
He's a beautiful boy!

00:25.250 --> 00:26.750
Oh, thanks.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.620
He really doesn't look
anything like George.

00:28.620 --> 00:31.040
Jack got beaten
within an inch of his life,
probably by that pimp.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.290
I just can't believe
that you guys are
doing this for me.

00:33.290 --> 00:35.620
We would like to
have you in our family.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.420
That's my sponsor.
You can't date her.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.750
This is the first woman
that I've been interested in.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.120
Hey, David!
George Juergens.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.880
George.
Anne's husband.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.290
How's your son?
You have a son, right?

00:46.290 --> 00:48.710
Right.
I'll be in touch.

00:48.710 --> 00:49.960
I want you
to have this baby.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.670
I know you're going
to be good parents.

00:51.670 --> 00:53.380
I do want to get married,
I really do.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.540
Shall we pray?

01:00.540 --> 01:03.420
♪ You better watch out
You better not cry

01:03.420 --> 01:05.580
♪ You better not pout
I'm telling you why

01:05.580 --> 01:06.960
♪ Why?

01:06.960 --> 01:08.880
♪ Santa Claus is
coming to town

01:08.880 --> 01:11.620
♪ Gather round

01:11.620 --> 01:14.580
♪ He's making a list
And checking it twice

01:14.580 --> 01:16.790
♪ He's gonna find out
who's naughty and nice... ♪

01:17.330 --> 01:19.000
Mmm.

01:19.000 --> 01:19.120
What time is it?

01:20.670 --> 01:22.710
Mmm. 6:00.

01:22.710 --> 01:27.420
Okay. Well,
we've had Christmas dinner
and opened the presents,

01:27.420 --> 01:29.830
what should we do
until Santa comes
at midnight?

01:29.830 --> 01:31.170
I don't know.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.960
What did you do
when you were a kid?

01:32.960 --> 01:33.830
Every year
was different.

01:33.830 --> 01:36.670
Um...

01:36.670 --> 01:38.580
There was always
a Christmas tree.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.920
Some years
we would open gifts
on Christmas Eve,

01:41.920 --> 01:43.920
and some years
we'd open them
on Christmas Day.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.210
And Santa Claus?

01:45.210 --> 01:47.540
Oh, yeah,
Santa always came.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.920
Ashley and I would
get up early to see
what he got us.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.380
What's the biggest
surprise you ever got
for Christmas?

01:52.380 --> 01:53.500
You mean,
besides John?

01:55.460 --> 01:57.460
Yeah, when you
were a kid,

01:57.460 --> 01:59.380
what's the best gift
you ever got,
the biggest surprise gift?

01:59.380 --> 02:02.670
The biggest surprise was
my first French horn.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.290
Uh... (CHUCKLES)

02:05.290 --> 02:07.120
I got it
when school started
in September

02:07.120 --> 02:08.620
in the fifth grade.

02:08.620 --> 02:11.540
My parents gave it to me
as an early Christmas gift.

02:11.540 --> 02:15.080
And then on Christmas Eve
my dad wrapped it up again
and put it in a big box.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.330
And when I opened it,
I was surprised that
it was my French horn.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.620
I'd been playing it
for three months.
(CHUCKLES)

02:20.620 --> 02:23.210
I forgot that it was
a Christmas gift.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.210
And to make it worse,
Ashley had a bicycle
in her big box.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.710
I was so upset
that my parents
bought me a bike

02:29.710 --> 02:33.290
when they went on sale
after Christmas.
(LAUGHS)

02:33.290 --> 02:35.580
I wanted a blue bike,
but they got Ashley
a blue bike,

02:35.580 --> 02:37.000
so I settled
for dark green,

02:37.000 --> 02:38.710
and it was
a boy's bike.

02:38.710 --> 02:41.040
That was
a bad Christmas.
(CHUCKLES)

02:41.040 --> 02:42.830
Not as bad as some
of my Christmases,
I'm sure.

02:42.830 --> 02:43.960
No, of course not.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.790
But not all of them
were bad.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.040
The ones I spent in juvie
were pretty good.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.500
How could a
Christmas in juvie
be good?

02:49.500 --> 02:52.380
It was downtown,
juvie hall,

02:52.380 --> 02:54.500
near Hedy's
Happy Holiday House.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.080
What is that?
What? You've never
been to Hedy's?

02:56.080 --> 02:58.750
No. I don't know
what Hedy's is.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.000
Hedy's is
the best toy store ever.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.670
Ever?
Yeah!

03:02.670 --> 03:03.710
It's, like, in the worst
section of downtown,

03:03.710 --> 03:05.670
it's a family-owned
business.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.620
It's like Santa's workshop
or something.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.120
It has old toys
and new toys,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.380
and lights and a train.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.080
We used to break in
every year.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.210
Those were
the best Christmases.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.580
The security guard would
always leave the loading
dock door unlocked

03:19.580 --> 03:21.460
and cracked
just a little bit.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.830
He knew kids would break in.
Hedy knew kids would break in.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.250
And we would break in.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.500
We'd climb up
the loading dock,

03:26.500 --> 03:30.330
go in and have ourselves
a little party.

03:30.330 --> 03:33.670
We never trashed
the place or anything,
we just ate the candy.

03:33.670 --> 03:36.170
Then when we
were ready to leave,

03:36.170 --> 03:37.830
we'd each take some
small toy we thought
they wouldn't miss,

03:37.830 --> 03:39.380
and that we could hide,

03:39.380 --> 03:40.830
and then we'd go
back out through
the loading dock.

03:40.830 --> 03:43.120
And you never
got caught?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.580
I think they knew, really.
It would have been easy
to catch us,

03:44.580 --> 03:45.750
there were
a dozen of us.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.000
Is it still there, Hedy's?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.170
I don't know,
it's been a while.

03:49.170 --> 03:51.210
Want to take a ride?
Yeah.
You want to break in?

03:51.210 --> 03:53.750
And get arrested
on Christmas Eve?
No, thank you.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.540
We're more likely
to get accosted

03:55.540 --> 03:57.170
by juvenile delinquents
than get arrested.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.880
No one's going to
get arrested.
Come on, let's do it.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.170
I mean,
I don't even know
if it's still there,

04:01.170 --> 04:02.960
but let's take John
and find out.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.210
Really?
Yeah.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.080
All right.
Let's go!

04:10.620 --> 04:13.040
AMY: Come on, John!
It's Christmas Eve!

04:13.040 --> 04:15.710
Let's go see
what Daddy did when
he was growing up!

04:15.710 --> 04:16.000

04:27.670 --> 04:33.380
♪ Falling in love
is such an easy
thing to do

04:33.380 --> 04:35.620
♪ Birds can do it

04:56.040 --> 04:57.620
It's open.
You go in first,

04:57.620 --> 04:58.710
I'll hand you John
and then I'll hop in.

04:58.710 --> 05:00.210
I don't want
to go first.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.920
You have to go first.
If you don't go first,

05:01.920 --> 05:02.880
you'll have to
get in by yourself.

05:04.830 --> 05:07.460
Here, I'll give
you a boost.

05:07.460 --> 05:09.880
Ricky, it sounded like
a good idea, but...

05:09.880 --> 05:11.170
Just do it.
Come on, hurry up.

05:13.210 --> 05:15.250
Find me something to step on
so I can get up there.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.750
I don't want you to boost me,
you might boost me
onto my head.

05:18.540 --> 05:21.120
Here. Try this.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.210
(SIGHS)

05:23.210 --> 05:24.380
Ricky...
Do it!

05:25.080 --> 05:26.120
Here. Go with Dad.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.330
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Um...

05:36.330 --> 05:37.330
Hand me John.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.000
It's just like I remember.
Come on.

05:56.540 --> 05:57.710
I can't believe it!

06:05.420 --> 06:07.170
(POWER SURGING)

06:23.120 --> 06:28.080
Um, it's amazing.
It's absolutely amazing.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.880
Isn't it? (CHUCKLES)

06:29.880 --> 06:31.960
What do you
think, John?

06:31.960 --> 06:34.500
Where's Santa?
Well, Santa's probably
already out delivering toys

06:34.500 --> 06:35.960
to all the good
little boys and girls.

06:39.210 --> 06:41.960
You know what?
Maybe you'd like to
ride on the train?

06:41.960 --> 06:43.170
You want to ride
on the train?

06:43.170 --> 06:44.790
I want to ride
on the train.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.380
I want to ride
on the train!

06:46.380 --> 06:47.670
Are we going to
ride on the train?

06:47.670 --> 06:49.170
We're going to do
a lot of things.

06:49.170 --> 06:51.330
Where's Santa?

06:51.330 --> 06:53.380
Let me see if I can
find out when he's
going to be back.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.580
Okay.
Come on, bud,
let's go.

06:57.960 --> 06:58.920
(PHONE BEEPING)

07:03.960 --> 07:05.080
(PHONE RINGING)

07:08.790 --> 07:11.420
Hey.
Hey. Merry Christmas.

07:11.420 --> 07:13.170
Yeah.
What's wrong?

07:13.170 --> 07:15.750
Shakur volunteered
to work in the emergency room

07:15.750 --> 07:17.040
and Margaret's down
at the Children's Center
dishing out dinner.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.380
Yeah. That's what
they always do.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.790
What are you doing?
Nothing.

07:20.790 --> 07:22.380
Absolutely nothing.

07:22.380 --> 07:25.420
I'm here alone
because Kathy's parents
don't want me

07:25.420 --> 07:27.750
to be part of
their stupid
family Christmas,

07:27.750 --> 07:30.960
so my first Christmas
with a family in years
totally sucks.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.790
I need you to
do me a favor.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.500
Dad keeps a Santa suit
in the hall closet.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.330
I need you to get it,
get on a bus and
come down to Hedy's.

07:40.330 --> 07:41.670
You must have
gone to Hedy's
at some point, right?

07:41.670 --> 07:44.580
You're at Hedy's?

07:44.580 --> 07:46.710
What are you doing
at Hedy's?

07:46.710 --> 07:48.830
It's Christmas Eve.
I brought Amy and
John down here.

07:48.830 --> 07:51.040
I thought I'd
show them a traditional
juvie Christmas.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.960
All right. Yeah,
I'll come down there,
sure.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.670
You know what?
Take a taxi.

07:54.670 --> 07:54.830
I'll give you the money
when you get here.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.750
I see envelopes
under the tree,
I think there's cash.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.790
Don't steal money
on Christmas Eve.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.250
I'll leave the money on
the loading dock.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.710
And you know what,
you be Santa.

08:06.710 --> 08:08.790
I was going to do it,
but you put on the
Santa suit and you do it.

08:08.790 --> 08:09.920
I'm not fat enough.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.250
Tell John you're on
a health kick.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.250
Santa wasn't always fat,
you know.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.960
I'll bring you the suit,
but I'm not
promising I'll be in it.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.000
Come on, it'll be fun.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.290
And hurry up,
'cause John's getting
really sleepy.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.210
Should I tell
Margaret and Shakur
where I'm going?

08:21.210 --> 08:23.290
Yeah. Tell them
you're going to spend
some time with us

08:23.290 --> 08:24.710
and we'll bring you
home by 8:00.

08:24.710 --> 08:26.420
And that's all
you tell them.

08:26.420 --> 08:26.790
I'm not stupid.
See you in 15 minutes.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.040
(CHUCKLING)
You look so cute!
You do, too.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.170
What are you doing?
I'm going to be
Santa for John.

08:42.170 --> 08:43.080
Aw.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.960
Ricky and Amy
have him at Hedy's.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.420
It's the crazy old
toy store downtown.
They snuck in.

08:49.420 --> 08:53.250
It's something you just did
if you were in
juvie hall at Christmas.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.880
So you're going
to sneak in, too?

08:54.880 --> 08:56.920
Yeah, it's great.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.120
I thought the tradition was
you didn't go unless you
were in juvie, but...

09:00.920 --> 09:02.250
It's unbelievable.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.670
I wish you could
go with me.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.670
How long are you
going to stay?
I should be home by 8:00.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.290
That's an hour
from now.

09:09.290 --> 09:11.210
I know.
I'm just going to
go down there,

09:11.210 --> 09:13.380
sneak in and
say, "Ho, ho, ho!"

09:13.380 --> 09:14.790
And they're
going to give me
a ride home, so...

09:17.330 --> 09:17.710
I guess
I better go then.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.830
Here. This is for you.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.380
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.500
And I have
something for you.

09:45.500 --> 09:45.750
(TUNE PLAYING)

09:51.620 --> 09:53.040
Our first date.
I know.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.920
Thank you.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.790
Really.
That is so thoughtful.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.080
Come on,
can't you go
with me?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.710
Well... Why not?

10:04.710 --> 10:07.420
What are they
going to do?
It's Christmas.

10:07.420 --> 10:08.170
I'll text them
from the car.

10:26.458 --> 10:30.908
Jack, it would be so nice
if you woke up in time
for Christmas.

10:30.908 --> 10:32.698
That would be
the best gift
I could ask for,

10:32.698 --> 10:33.458
for you to wake up.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.658
You sure you don't
want to wake up?
For me?

10:38.498 --> 10:40.998
Maybe, uh...

10:40.998 --> 10:42.788
Maybe he doesn't
know it's Christmas.

10:42.788 --> 10:45.538
Oh, no, Adrian,
he knows it's Christmas,
he just...

10:45.538 --> 10:48.158
He knows what I'm saying,
he just can't respond.
You know?

10:48.158 --> 10:51.538
Not yet anyway,
but he will.
Won't you, Jack?

10:53.328 --> 10:56.578
Okay, well,
we're going to
have to leave soon.

10:56.578 --> 10:59.198
We're having
Christmas dinner
with my family.

10:59.198 --> 11:02.368
And 50 other people
from the church.

11:02.368 --> 11:04.698
I'm telling you, it's fun.
It's going to be fun.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.248
No, it's not.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.288
And we have to go
to my parents', too.

11:07.288 --> 11:10.498
No, we don't.
Yes, we do.

11:10.498 --> 11:11.498
My mother invited them.
They're coming
to the house.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.538
What?
(CHUCKLES)

11:13.538 --> 11:16.908
You better not be
proposing to me or
anything stupid like that.

11:16.908 --> 11:18.328
Uh, I'm not
proposing to you.

11:18.328 --> 11:19.788
I've already
proposed to you

11:19.788 --> 11:21.618
and I'm still waiting
on an answer,

11:21.618 --> 11:24.118
and I'm not
getting you a ring
until you've said yes.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.038
But I love you.
If you loved me,

11:26.038 --> 11:28.408
you wouldn't torture me
on Christmas Eve.

11:28.408 --> 11:30.328
I don't want to
spend Christmas
with family.

11:30.328 --> 11:31.658
This was
a compromise,
remember?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.958
Tonight we spend
with our families

11:33.958 --> 11:36.458
and tomorrow
we have Christmas Day
all to ourselves.

11:36.458 --> 11:37.998
Not that that's
going to be fun either.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.158
I like being
around my family
at Christmas.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.288
I have nieces
and nephews

11:42.288 --> 11:43.958
and I like to see them
get all excited and
open gifts and all that.

11:43.958 --> 11:46.248
And the food!
Oh, my God!

11:46.248 --> 11:47.288
You wouldn't believe
the food we have
at our house.

11:47.288 --> 11:47.458
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:48.908 --> 11:50.498
Hi. It's me.

11:50.498 --> 11:51.998
Hi.

11:51.998 --> 11:53.408
Merry Christmas,
Clementine.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.828
I was really surprised
to get your text.

11:55.828 --> 11:56.958
Thank you
for inviting me
to stop by.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.788
Oh, no.
I am so happy
you did.

11:58.788 --> 12:02.368
I really wanted
some of Jack's friends
to drop by,

12:02.368 --> 12:03.788
but, so far,
you are the only one.

12:03.788 --> 12:04.658
(CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)

12:06.868 --> 12:08.788
Oh. Well, except for
Adrian and Omar.

12:10.198 --> 12:11.408
Hi. Merry Christmas.

12:11.408 --> 12:13.288
Merry Christmas.

12:13.288 --> 12:15.118
Is that a gift?
Oh.

12:15.118 --> 12:17.198
Yeah. It's just
a little something
for Jack and Grace.

12:17.198 --> 12:18.658
I didn't realize
you would be here.

12:18.658 --> 12:19.698
I would have brought
you something.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.038
Oh, you didn't
have to do that.

12:21.038 --> 12:23.578
But it would
have been nice.

12:23.578 --> 12:25.288
Merry Christmas,
Clementine.

12:25.288 --> 12:26.908
We were just leaving
to go to my house.

12:26.908 --> 12:28.578
You and Grace
should come with us.

12:28.578 --> 12:30.198
Oh, I can't.
I'm staying here
until midnight.

12:30.198 --> 12:31.578
Well, almost midnight.

12:31.578 --> 12:33.498
I promised my mom
I'd be home in time

12:33.498 --> 12:35.538
for midnight
church services.

12:35.538 --> 12:37.118
Jack's dad decided to
do that this year,

12:37.118 --> 12:40.658
a special prayer service
for Jack on Christmas.

12:40.658 --> 12:42.288
'Cause Jack loves Christmas,
don't you, Jack?

12:44.828 --> 12:45.868
Open the gift.

12:45.868 --> 12:46.908
Oh. Okay.

12:50.788 --> 12:54.248
Did you ever see the movie,
It's a Wonderful Life?

12:54.248 --> 12:58.538
Every time a bell rings,
it's because
an angel gets its wings.

12:58.538 --> 13:01.158
I was hoping maybe,
you know,

13:01.158 --> 13:03.198
an angel would get his wings
by waking up Jack.

13:04.248 --> 13:06.158
(RINGING)

13:06.158 --> 13:08.328
That's a great idea!
It's so thoughtful.
Thank you.

13:09.328 --> 13:11.828
Oh. Do you want
some candy?

13:11.828 --> 13:13.328
'Cause Adrian and Omar
brought some candy.

13:15.288 --> 13:18.038
Well, not just any candy,

13:18.038 --> 13:22.328
it's taffy made by monks
at some monastery
or something.

13:22.328 --> 13:24.578
And also
very thoughtful.
Hmm.

13:24.578 --> 13:26.998
I'll pass, but thanks.
I have to get going.

13:26.998 --> 13:28.288
Oh, really?
So soon?

13:28.288 --> 13:29.958
We got to
get going, too.

13:29.958 --> 13:32.368
Everyone's leaving?
Really?

13:32.368 --> 13:34.538
Yeah, I have this stupid
Christmas tradition
to keep up.

13:34.538 --> 13:36.868
Yeah, us, too.

13:36.868 --> 13:39.328
What are you doing?
It's just this
stupid thing I did

13:39.328 --> 13:41.908
when I was
in social services.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.998
A small group of us
would sneak out
on Christmas Eve

13:44.998 --> 13:47.328
and sneak in
to this store.

13:47.328 --> 13:49.198
You ever been to
Hedy's Happy Holiday
House downtown?

13:49.198 --> 13:51.538
I heard about it.
It's a toy store,
right?

13:51.538 --> 13:53.458
Yeah.
Are you still
sneaking in?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.038
Does that mean
breaking in?
Yeah.

13:55.038 --> 13:56.788
But it's not
what you think.

13:56.788 --> 13:58.868
They leave a way in.

13:58.868 --> 14:01.198
They know that kids
who have no place to go
are going to come in

14:01.198 --> 14:03.368
and they know that
they're going to leave
with a little something.

14:03.368 --> 14:05.658
So I'm too old to
go with the other kids,

14:05.658 --> 14:09.078
but I drop by
a little early and
just look around.

14:10.578 --> 14:12.538
I love it.
I want to do that.

14:12.538 --> 14:15.998
You want to do what?
I want to go to Hedy's
Happy Holiday House.

14:15.998 --> 14:18.368
We have to go
to Mom's Happy
Holiday House.

14:18.368 --> 14:19.908
You all could go
if you want.

14:19.908 --> 14:20.958
I only stop by
for a few minutes.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.288
It's an amazing place.

14:23.288 --> 14:25.368
If you've never seen it,
you really should go.

14:25.368 --> 14:26.458
Grace?
You want to go?

14:27.158 --> 14:29.038
Uh...

14:29.038 --> 14:30.618
No. I mean,
not without Jack.

14:30.618 --> 14:32.658
Well, don't they
come in and put him
in a wheelchair

14:32.658 --> 14:34.868
and wheel him around
every few hours?

14:34.868 --> 14:36.038
Yeah. A couple
times a day.

14:36.038 --> 14:37.248
But he's already had
his rides today.

14:38.828 --> 14:41.288
But today is Christmas,

14:41.288 --> 14:43.198
maybe he'd like
another ride.

14:43.998 --> 14:46.118
A bigger ride.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.658
A ride downtown
to Hedy's.

14:47.658 --> 14:50.578
Uh, Adrian...
Your mom said
any time.

14:50.578 --> 14:53.458
We can come down
at any time.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.248
There are so
many people there,

14:55.248 --> 14:57.538
she's not going to care
if we show up just, what,

14:57.538 --> 14:58.118
a half-hour later
than we said we would.

14:58.118 --> 15:00.868
Let's do it.

15:00.868 --> 15:01.958
Let's put Jack
in a wheelchair and
take him with us.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.618
I mean, it's not
gonna hurt him,

15:03.618 --> 15:05.458
and maybe it would
help him wake up.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.828
Just tell the nurse
to put him in the chair,

15:07.828 --> 15:09.408
we want to take him
outside and let him
see the Christmas lights.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.998
He can't see
the Christmas lights.

15:10.998 --> 15:12.118
Who knows what
he can see?

15:12.118 --> 15:13.368
Let's do it!

15:13.368 --> 15:15.618
Hurry!
Hurry up!

15:15.618 --> 15:16.908
I can't believe
we're doing this!

15:16.908 --> 15:19.368
Merry Christmas, Jack!
Wake up!

15:19.368 --> 15:22.868
COP: Hey! Hey!
What are you
doing there?

15:22.868 --> 15:25.038
I got it.
You? I got it.

15:25.038 --> 15:26.118
Let me explain.
Somebody better explain.

15:26.118 --> 15:29.408
It's me, Officer.

15:29.408 --> 15:31.248
I'm trying to steal my
boyfriend and take him to
a toy store on Christmas.

15:31.248 --> 15:33.868
He's been semi-comatose
for months

15:33.868 --> 15:37.078
and his doctors just
thought it would be really
good for him to get out.

15:37.078 --> 15:38.698
I'll put him back.

15:38.698 --> 15:40.198
His doctors?
Well, I'm his girlfriend,

15:40.198 --> 15:42.328
but I've been supervising
his medical care.

15:42.328 --> 15:44.788
'Cause I've been
at med camp
for three years

15:44.788 --> 15:46.658
and then in the fall
I'll be pre-med
and I'll be a doctor.

15:46.658 --> 15:48.868
But you're not
a doctor now, are you?
I'll put him back.

15:48.868 --> 15:50.538
All right, somebody's gonna
have to go put him back.

15:50.538 --> 15:52.288
Please, please, please don't
make us put him back.

15:52.288 --> 15:54.698
I really think it would
be good for him to get out.

15:54.698 --> 15:56.748
It's Christmas!

15:56.748 --> 15:58.788
Yeah, and I'm not
getting fired
on Christmas Eve.

15:58.788 --> 16:02.658
Look, I'm sorry,
but you can't just
steal a patient.

16:02.658 --> 16:04.198
Now, you go
get him checked out
legitimately,

16:04.198 --> 16:06.328
I'll be the first one
to help you out, but...

16:06.328 --> 16:07.198
I'm sorry, toots.

16:07.868 --> 16:08.118
(RINGING)

16:11.408 --> 16:13.578
Come on, we'll put
Jack back in bed

16:13.578 --> 16:15.868
and then the rest of us
should go,
just for a few minutes.

16:15.868 --> 16:17.498
It'll get everyone
in the Christmas spirit.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.658
Where were you going?
Oh, just this toy store.

16:20.328 --> 16:22.618
Hedy's?

16:22.618 --> 16:24.288
Yeah, you wouldn't know it
to look at her,
but she was a delinquent.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.868
No, you wouldn't.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.458
All right, let's go.
I'll go.

16:30.458 --> 16:35.078
You guys should, uh...
You guys should take off.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.288
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Merry Christmas, Grace!

16:37.288 --> 16:38.538
Merry Christmas, Grace.
Merry Christmas, Grace.

16:38.538 --> 16:39.328
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:40.788 --> 16:42.158
ALL: Merry Christmas, Jack!

16:42.868 --> 16:44.618
Let's do this.

17:05.417 --> 17:07.167
Psst!

17:07.997 --> 17:09.587
Little problem here.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.417
I'll be right back.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.207
What took you
so long?

17:17.707 --> 17:19.377
What?
I need some help.

17:19.377 --> 17:20.297
I brought Kathy with me.

17:23.757 --> 17:25.127
Hi. Merry Christmas.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.497
Yeah. Hey, Kathy.
Merry Christmas.

17:28.497 --> 17:29.877
Who are you?
Taxi.

17:29.877 --> 17:30.997
Oh. Here,
let me pay you.

17:30.997 --> 17:32.837
No, it's okay.

17:32.837 --> 17:34.797
Just helping
a couple of people out
on Christmas Eve.

17:34.797 --> 17:36.667
I mean, once she's in,
I'm done for the night.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.167
You didn't think
this through,
did you?

17:38.167 --> 17:39.587
That's okay,
I don't have to come in.

17:39.587 --> 17:41.917
I can just
go back home.

17:41.917 --> 17:43.917
I think my parents are
kind of upset with me
anyway.

17:43.917 --> 17:44.707
What kind of
alarm system are
we looking at here?

17:44.707 --> 17:46.547
I don't know.

17:46.547 --> 17:48.497
I got to make
a phone call,
I think I can find out.

17:48.497 --> 17:50.707
Maybe we can
open a door

17:50.707 --> 17:52.207
without tripping the alarm
if I just know
what the system is.

17:52.207 --> 17:53.047
Well, make the phone call!

17:58.707 --> 17:59.087
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

18:05.167 --> 18:07.547
Hey, Ethan.
Hey. I need a number
for the girl

18:07.547 --> 18:09.207
whose dad owns
the security company.
You know the one.

18:09.207 --> 18:11.047
What do you
need it for?

18:11.047 --> 18:13.917
Uh, I just want to ask
about a certain kind of lock.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.377
What kind of lock?

18:15.377 --> 18:17.167
Can I just have the number?
I'm kind of busy here.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.837
I don't know if
she'd like you to
have her number.

18:18.837 --> 18:19.877
Fine, you got
a security guy there
who could help me out?

18:19.877 --> 18:22.587
One of your guys?

18:22.587 --> 18:23.797
Maybe. But you're
going to have to tell me
what's going on.

18:23.797 --> 18:26.207
Okay.

18:26.207 --> 18:28.707
What's going on is that
I'm at a toy store
playing Santa

18:28.707 --> 18:30.127
and I've locked myself
into an area that I need
to get out of

18:30.127 --> 18:31.587
and I don't want to
set off any alarms.

18:31.587 --> 18:33.497
That sounds
kind of fishy to me.

18:33.497 --> 18:35.297
Hey. What's up?

18:35.297 --> 18:37.297
Is that the girl who's your
sister, the one who...
Yeah.

18:37.297 --> 18:39.417
Who is that?
(WHISPERING) It's Ethan.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.957
Let me speak to her.
She doesn't know anything
about alarm systems.

18:41.957 --> 18:42.047
I might.

18:44.337 --> 18:45.587
Hey, who is this?
Ethan.

18:45.587 --> 18:47.957
You know me
from school, right?

18:47.957 --> 18:50.257
Are you familiar with
a toy store called...

18:50.257 --> 18:52.047
Hedy's? Oh, my God,
are you at Hedy's?

18:52.047 --> 18:54.497
I am. And I've got
my girlfriend down here

18:54.497 --> 18:56.127
who's nine months pregnant
and, well...

18:57.957 --> 18:59.877
I can't get her up
on the loading dock.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.707
Loading dock?
I never used
the loading dock.

19:02.707 --> 19:04.667
There's a hidden door
on the side of the building,
I'll tell you where it is.

19:04.667 --> 19:07.127
There's no locks on it,
you don't have to worry
about locks or alarms

19:07.127 --> 19:08.837
or anything like that,
you just have to find it.

19:08.837 --> 19:10.587
There's a
side entrance.

19:10.587 --> 19:11.627
There's a
side entrance.

19:11.627 --> 19:13.337
Good. That's good.

19:13.337 --> 19:15.127
I really need to sit down.
She's getting really heavy.

19:15.997 --> 19:16.917
Hurry it up.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.457
When is she due?

19:20.797 --> 19:20.877
She's not, like,
due now is she?

19:22.457 --> 19:23.457
(DISCONNECTS)

19:23.457 --> 19:23.837
No, she's
just nine months.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.707
Yeah, it's downtown
in this really iffy area.

19:30.707 --> 19:32.257
The kids come
in around midnight,
they're out by 2:00.

19:32.257 --> 19:33.957
And you went in there?

19:33.957 --> 19:35.377
I went in there,
yeah, some of us

19:35.377 --> 19:40.337
sometimes went in there
after the kids had gone,

19:40.337 --> 19:41.547
but we didn't
stay long,
believe me.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.587
And you had to work
on Christmas Eve?

19:43.587 --> 19:45.797
Lot of lonely guys
on Christmas Eve.

19:45.797 --> 19:47.627
I never even
heard of the place.

19:48.667 --> 19:51.297
Heard of what?
Hedy's.

19:51.297 --> 19:53.457
It's this place downtown.
I don't think you'd know it.

19:53.457 --> 19:55.127
Oh, you don't, huh?

19:55.127 --> 19:56.877
You do?
Yeah,
I'm familiar with it.

19:56.877 --> 20:01.377
You should go down there
sometime and take a look.

20:01.377 --> 20:04.957
But, uh, you may want
to take someone with you,
one of our guys.

20:04.957 --> 20:07.047
In fact,
while we're
killing time,

20:07.047 --> 20:08.257
why don't you
take a ride?

20:08.257 --> 20:09.547
But it's almost 8:00.

20:09.547 --> 20:11.457
Aren't we having
dinner at 8:00?

20:11.457 --> 20:12.837
We always have dinner
at 8:00 on Christmas Eve.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.547
Not this Christmas Eve.
Moved it to midnight.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.957
Midnight? Ugh!
Man, I'm starving!

20:17.957 --> 20:20.337
Yeah, there's going
to be snacks
to hold us over.

20:20.337 --> 20:22.457
Some...
What are they?
Canapes.

20:22.457 --> 20:23.997
Yeah, what are they?
Snacks.

20:23.997 --> 20:26.047
Why are we having dinner
at midnight?

20:26.047 --> 20:27.337
'Cause that's
Camille's tradition.

20:27.337 --> 20:29.207
I never realized it,
but I used to

20:29.207 --> 20:30.917
keep her at the office
late every Christmas Eve

20:30.917 --> 20:32.837
trying to get
everything ready for us,

20:32.837 --> 20:36.047
so by the time
she got home and put
something in the oven

20:36.047 --> 20:39.207
and cleaned up and
got her Christmas lights
on the tree

20:39.207 --> 20:43.127
and got her
Christmas dinner ready,
it was midnight.

20:43.127 --> 20:45.757
So that became her
tradition, because of us.

20:45.757 --> 20:48.417
So shouldn't we be
feeding her before
midnight now?

20:48.417 --> 20:50.757
She likes midnight.

20:50.757 --> 20:52.207
And she's still
in there getting
things ready for us.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.417
All right. Well...

20:53.417 --> 20:55.957
Well, let's take a ride.

20:55.957 --> 20:57.707
If you're gonna go downtown,
you should have
someone drive you.

20:57.707 --> 20:59.957
Dad...
Ben.

20:59.957 --> 21:02.457
I think he's right.
Then this Hedy place
will just have to wait.

21:02.457 --> 21:04.797
Maybe we'll, um, I don't know,
drive around and look at
Christmas lights or something.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.547
And what about
the canapes?

21:07.547 --> 21:09.047
Take 'em with you.
I'll just get my coat.

21:14.457 --> 21:17.957
I was coming up to tell you,
keep her out of the house
for a while,

21:17.957 --> 21:20.707
we want to decorate
her room with a tree
and presents and stuff.

21:20.707 --> 21:23.167
Uh, I don't think she
believes in Santa Claus.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.997
Don't be a Scrooge,
it's Christmas Eve.

21:24.997 --> 21:28.087
It's her first
Christmas Eve with us.
We want it to make it good.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.917
Like Christmas isn't
always good at this house?

21:29.917 --> 21:31.377
Thanks.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.997
I'll try to keep her out
as long as I can.

21:32.997 --> 21:34.457
Merry Christmas, son.
Merry Christmas.

21:41.257 --> 21:43.497
Now?
He's sleeping now?

21:43.497 --> 21:45.167
Yeah. I couldn't keep
him awake any longer.

21:45.167 --> 21:47.497
But...
Santa is here.

21:47.497 --> 21:49.337
Well, he's out cold.

21:50.997 --> 21:51.877
Merry Christmas!

21:56.757 --> 22:01.087
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas
one and all!

22:01.087 --> 22:01.757
Oh, Santa! (CHUCKLES)

22:03.707 --> 22:05.127
Hey, John.

22:05.127 --> 22:06.127
Hey, John,
Santa's here.

22:15.087 --> 22:16.917
Hey!
What are you
doing here?

22:16.917 --> 22:18.707
It's so good to
see you!
Merry Christmas!

22:18.707 --> 22:20.457
Merry Christmas!

22:20.457 --> 22:23.087
Wow!
Look at this place!
This is crazy!

22:23.087 --> 22:24.087
Didn't I tell you?

22:25.837 --> 22:27.337
Find her a place
to sit down.

22:27.337 --> 22:28.707
Are you okay, Kathy?
Yeah, are you okay?

22:28.707 --> 22:29.837
She's fine.

22:29.837 --> 22:29.917
You're fine, right?

22:38.377 --> 22:40.667
RICKY: Hey!
What are you
doing here!

22:40.667 --> 22:42.127
What are you
doing here?

22:42.127 --> 22:44.547
I wanted Amy and John
to see this.

22:44.547 --> 22:48.167
I come down here
every year all by myself,
just for a few minutes.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.877
Well, this year,
you have friends.

22:50.877 --> 22:52.337
Merry Christmas,
Clementine!

22:57.377 --> 22:59.297
I don't believe this.

22:59.297 --> 23:00.957
Me neither.
This is crazy good.

23:00.957 --> 23:01.797
Merry Christmas,
everyone!

23:03.797 --> 23:04.547
Hey, guys!

23:04.547 --> 23:05.797
We found it!

23:05.797 --> 23:08.417
AMY: Well,
what do you think?

23:08.417 --> 23:09.837
I think there are
a lot of people here, Amy.

23:09.837 --> 23:12.257
Oh, come on.
I wanted them
to see it!

23:12.257 --> 23:13.497
Merry Christmas!

23:13.497 --> 23:15.127
Yeah. Merry Christmas,
everyone!

23:15.127 --> 23:17.337
Merry Christmas,
everyone!

23:17.337 --> 23:19.837
Uh, I think, um...
I think we have to
leave though.

23:19.837 --> 23:22.917
Yeah, we better
get you home to your
parents and your grandma.

23:22.917 --> 23:24.257
We need to get
me to a hospital.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.257
The first time too many
teenagers have the sex talk
with their parents

23:40.257 --> 23:42.417
is when they're telling them
that they're pregnant.

23:42.417 --> 23:45.087
Parents, if your teen
has a question about sex,

23:45.087 --> 23:47.547
don't assume
they're doing it.

23:47.547 --> 23:48.837
And teens,
if your parents aren't
talking to you about sex,

23:48.837 --> 23:50.997
don't assume
that they don't care.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.757
Teenage pregnancy
is 100% preventable.

23:53.757 --> 23:55.667
Start talking.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.457
Visit stayteen.org
or abcfamily.com
for more information.

24:03.127 --> 24:05.627
How far apart are
the contractions now?

24:05.627 --> 24:09.877
Um, they are many,
many minutes apart.

24:09.877 --> 24:11.667
Many.
How many?

24:11.667 --> 24:13.917
Why don't you, like,
play some music
or something?

24:13.917 --> 24:16.047
Wouldn't it be nice to
hear some music, Kathy?
Yeah.

24:16.047 --> 24:19.627
Oh, my God,
I hope she doesn't
make it to the hospital.

24:19.627 --> 24:22.127
What?
It's like the birth of Christ

24:22.127 --> 24:24.337
and we're the
three wise women!

24:24.337 --> 24:26.997
Uh, it would not be
wise to have a baby
in the toy store.

24:26.997 --> 24:28.337
We have to
get her to a hospital.
She's what, 15?

24:28.877 --> 24:29.997
Hmm...

24:34.497 --> 24:36.087
I don't believe I did this.
I don't believe I did this.

24:36.087 --> 24:37.457
We saw your car,
so we drove in.

24:40.497 --> 24:41.297
No!
No!

24:43.047 --> 24:45.797
Hey!
Merry Christmas, guys!
What's going on?

24:45.797 --> 24:48.457
What's going on is
that Kathy's in there

24:48.457 --> 24:50.417
and she's having a baby
and for some reason
the ambulance isn't here

24:50.417 --> 24:52.047
and we can't get our cars
out of this parking lot.

24:52.047 --> 24:53.997
And now
you can't either!

24:53.997 --> 24:56.757
Hmm.
Never drove
here before.

24:56.757 --> 24:58.047
Yeah. Me neither.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

25:00.957 --> 25:02.257
Where are they?
Sir, we're having
trouble

25:02.257 --> 25:04.207
finding Hedy's
Happy Holiday House.

25:04.207 --> 25:05.837
We don't have
a listing for it.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.917
Are you sure you don't
have an address?

25:07.917 --> 25:09.957
They're not even
on the way!
Oh, my God.

25:09.957 --> 25:11.047
No. There's no
address on
the building!

25:11.047 --> 25:12.457
Cross street?
I don't know.

25:12.457 --> 25:13.457
It's just blocks
from juvie hall.

25:13.457 --> 25:15.207
The old one
or the new one?

25:15.207 --> 25:17.297
There's a new one?
It's near the old one.

25:17.297 --> 25:18.957
All right,
we're working on it.
(TAPPING KEYBOARD)

25:18.957 --> 25:19.587
Are you anywhere
near the stockyard?

25:19.587 --> 25:21.167
The what?

25:21.167 --> 25:24.127
I think I see
the stockyard.

25:24.127 --> 25:26.497
Was there an
ambulance or not?
Uh...

25:26.497 --> 25:28.047
They're working on it.

25:28.047 --> 25:30.087
Just look at this place!

25:30.087 --> 25:33.207
Oh, dear.
I can't have
a baby in here.

25:33.207 --> 25:35.167
I'm going to be
in so much trouble
with my parents

25:35.167 --> 25:36.417
and with her parents.

Are they sending in

Yeah. Is somebody

26:10.167 --> 26:11.127

I think we're gonna

will be back

26:49.499 --> 26:51.379

26:53.959 --> 26:55.999
I'm off duty. Um...

26:55.999 --> 26:57.499
I'm going to
meet my brothers
at this little diner.

care to join me?
Oh. Um...

Maybe.

Come on,
get in the holiday spirit.

27:07.289 --> 27:08.589
They serve a traditional
Christmas dinner all night.

27:08.589 --> 27:10.669
What about
pumpkin pie?

27:10.669 --> 27:11.209
Do they have
pumpkin pie?

27:11.209 --> 27:13.539
Of course.

You can't have Christmas
without pumpkin pie.

27:14.459 --> 27:16.669
Okay. Well, then I'm in.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.089
All right.

27:18.089 --> 27:18.919

help me out here!

Hey! What are you
doing here?

27:32.539 --> 27:35.249
What am I doing here?
It's Christmas Eve,
you dummy.

27:35.249 --> 27:36.999
Get the food and the gifts
out of the car.
Is everybody here?

27:36.999 --> 27:38.209
Well, not everybody.
Oh!

27:38.209 --> 27:39.379
It took me six hours
to get here.

Hi, George.
Hey, Mimsy.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.789

You want a drink?

27:46.789 --> 27:48.169
Oh, yeah. Sure.

you are really pretty!

28:07.379 --> 28:07.629
Is this your wife?

28:09.129 --> 28:11.709
Uh, I was.

28:11.709 --> 28:13.329
Oh, so was she.

28:13.329 --> 28:14.499
I thought this was
a family dinner.

28:14.499 --> 28:15.789
That's tomorrow night.
Over at Amy's.

28:15.789 --> 28:17.459
And I'm not invited,

28:17.459 --> 28:20.499
so we thought we'd
have our Christmas
tonight.

28:20.499 --> 28:23.289
I, uh, dropped
Tom off with Grace
at the hospital

28:23.289 --> 28:24.829
and then we're
picking them up later,

28:24.829 --> 28:26.329
and then we're
going to church,

28:26.329 --> 28:27.089

I'll go change.

gotten together on
Christmas Eve.

it was your
daughter's idea.

And by the way,
your girlfriend's not invited
tomorrow night either.

Oh, yes she is!

28:39.829 --> 28:42.289
We're doing
family dinner tonight

28:42.289 --> 28:43.419
and then tomorrow night,
we're spending Christmas
together.

28:43.419 --> 28:45.039
Not at Amy's.
This totally...

28:45.039 --> 28:47.209
Sucks.

28:47.209 --> 28:49.169
I'm going to go
put Robie down.

28:49.169 --> 28:51.919
Oh, that woman
is such a whiner.
I mean...

28:51.919 --> 28:54.629
I thought she would
never shut up
about the traffic.

28:54.629 --> 28:57.039
I mean, six hours
in a car with that woman.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.249

She wasn't supposed to
be here till tomorrow.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.709
I guess Amy didn't
make that clear.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.829
Guess my Christmas
present to you is
just gonna have to wait.

29:16.829 --> 29:18.629
Mine as well.

29:18.629 --> 29:19.629

window of opportunity.

some food in the car.

I know you're just trying
to make me feel better,

have to make things up.

get going to church soon.

I asked you months ago.

I hope they didn't
tell my parents.

not getting a ring.

come in, they could take
