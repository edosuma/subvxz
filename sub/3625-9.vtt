[Gossip Girl]
Gossip Girl here.

00:02.437 --> 00:03.394
Your one and only source

00:03.481 --> 00:04.395
into the scandalous lives

00:04.482 --> 00:05.396
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.483 --> 00:06.397
How's your mom doing

00:06.484 --> 00:07.703
with the divorce and everything?

00:07.790 --> 00:09.574
So my dad left her
for another man.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.837
She lost 15 pounds, got an eye
lift. It's been good for her.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.014
My mom kind of left us
a couple months ago.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.494
My dad and my sister
don't really see that.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.801
I don't know what's happened
with my wife or my marriage

00:18.888 --> 00:20.237
and you showing up here randomly

00:20.324 --> 00:21.934
doesn't make figuring
that out any easier.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.980
Am I the only one who thinks
this is extremely weird?

00:24.067 --> 00:25.895
Forget about it. If dad
can let it go, so can you.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.418
[Serena]
'I can't believe you didn't tell
me your mom came home.'

00:27.505 --> 00:29.029
Your wife despises me.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.595
- I wouldn't say that.
- Well, she did.

00:30.682 --> 00:31.770
You should deal
with your father.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.120
He needs you. I don't.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.643
We broke up, okay?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.036
He was gonna get
back together with me

00:36.123 --> 00:37.559
but only so my mom
would help his dad.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.474
I need your support here,
son, and your trust.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.518
Well, you better hope
for your sake they don't

00:40.605 --> 00:42.042
call your son to the stand.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.478
Do you like me?

00:43.565 --> 00:44.783
[Chuck]
Define like.

00:48.439 --> 00:49.745
[indistinct whispering]

00:49.832 --> 00:51.312
[Gossip Girl]
And who am I?

00:51.399 --> 00:53.270
That's one secret
I'll never tell.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.619
[theme music]

00:54.706 --> 00:56.447
You know you love me.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.279
[instrumental music]

01:02.366 --> 01:04.890
As per Gossip Girl's
Thanksgiving tradition

01:04.977 --> 01:07.284
I'm trading my laptop
for stovetop.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.025
And for the next 16 hours

01:09.112 --> 01:11.549
the only thing
I'm dishing is seconds.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.986
When the cat's away,
the mice will play.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.379
Have fun, little rodents.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.992
I mean, who gets
wasted on Thanksgiving?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.690
The holidays
are lonely for people.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.257
I wanted to keep
'em company.

01:23.344 --> 01:24.258
Whoo!

01:27.783 --> 01:30.481
Your mom is freaking out,
so my mom is freaking out.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.004
What, which means
you freak out?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.745
Blair, just cut
the cord. Go nuts.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.182
Come on. Let's do shots.
Come on!

01:35.269 --> 01:38.750
I told Lily that you
were buying a pie.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.796
- Oh, pie.
- Where's your purse?

01:41.971 --> 01:43.233
Uh, my purse..

01:43.320 --> 01:45.322
Oh, great. Alright.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.020
You stay here, okay?
I'm gonna go look.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.587
Don't drink
or hit on anything.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.199
Pie's been secured.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.201
Thanksgiving no longer
needs to be canceled.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.593
Alright?

01:55.680 --> 01:56.812
Um..

01:56.899 --> 01:58.118
[tires screeching]

01:58.205 --> 01:59.423
[horn honking]

01:59.510 --> 02:00.468
Hey, mom, you know,
I need to go.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.078
I'm sorry. Bye.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.862
[horn honking]

02:03.949 --> 02:05.037
Oh, man.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.040
[tires screeching]

02:08.128 --> 02:09.041
[male #1]
Hey! What are you doing?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.740
Hey, right of way...pal.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.045
- 'Screw you, buddy!'
- Hey.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.046
Uh, excu-excuse me,
d-do you need

02:14.134 --> 02:16.179
like a crossing guard or a..

02:16.266 --> 02:17.615
...cab maybe?

02:19.400 --> 02:21.402
Oh, pie.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.012
[Dan]
'More like road kill now.'

02:23.099 --> 02:25.232
But, uh, better it
than you, right?

02:27.234 --> 02:29.149
Um..

02:29.236 --> 02:31.063
I'm-I'm Dan Humphrey.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.239
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.718
Uh...I don't know

02:33.805 --> 02:34.763
we met last year.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.200
Uh, you, you might not remember.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.549
Yeah, I..
You probably don't.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.072
But, look, you should
be more careful.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.161
And you need to keep
your hands off of her.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.205
Blair!

02:42.292 --> 02:43.554
Trying to take advantage of her

02:43.641 --> 02:45.469
on the holidays. Come on.
Let's go, Serena.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.473
[Serena chuckling]

02:49.560 --> 02:51.127
Bye, Dave.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.389
Bye.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.651
Bye.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.698
Bye, Serena.

02:59.918 --> 03:02.007
- Hey.
- And hello to you.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.487
Big national holiday.
You excited?

03:03.574 --> 03:05.228
Kind of am.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.838
It might be the first
Thanksgiving in a while

03:06.925 --> 03:08.405
that I actually remember.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.059
Yeah, I bet.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.800
- Huh?
- Uh, nothing.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.889
- Uh, you, uh, you at Blair's?
- Almost.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.021
Her dad's gonna be home
for the first time since he left

03:16.108 --> 03:17.458
so she's really excited.

03:17.545 --> 03:18.807
Oh, well, family reunions

03:18.894 --> 03:19.895
are all around then.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.244
Uh, we too, have a full

03:21.331 --> 03:23.551
Humphrey household.
Hopefully, it'll stick.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.640
Well, it seems like
your mom is really trying.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.816
Better Thanksgiving than never.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.383
Call me between every course?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.515
- 'Okay.'
- Muah. Bye.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.128
Mom, is it really okay to cook
with this much heavy cream?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.522
Our arteries give us
a free pass on Turkey Day.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.829
It's a shame our family doesn't
have a few hundred more members.

03:40.916 --> 03:41.960
Do you think I
bought too much?

03:42.047 --> 03:43.353
Only by several tons.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.572
But it's our
first holiday back.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.443
I wanted to make sure
it was special.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.924
Mmm, I think they
call that guilt.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.666
Yeah, I guess they do.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.407
But if it means more
midnight turkey sandwiches

03:53.494 --> 03:54.886
for all of us, then so be it.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.888
Yeah, see, Dan, uh,
we on this side of the kitchen

03:56.975 --> 03:58.716
choose to be positive.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.892
Yeah, Dan. What's it gonna be?

04:00.979 --> 04:04.418
- 'You with us or against us?'
- Uh, ha ha, fine, fine.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.071
But only if I can take the
cranberry sauce out of the can.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.334
That is my specialty.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.294
I have to find this recipe
before my dad gets here.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.601
Harold Waldorf's
famous pumpkin pie.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.429
Well, it may have been
Bobby Flay's, but it didn't

04:15.516 --> 04:17.953
stop my dad from
taking credit for it.

04:18.040 --> 04:18.954
It's gonna be perfect!

04:19.041 --> 04:20.825
Look at you.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.218
Quite the chipper sous-chef.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.699
Well, I'm in a good mood.
It happens.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.091
Sometimes 'cause I
increase my Lexapro

04:26.178 --> 04:27.441
sometimes because
my dad's in town.

04:27.528 --> 04:29.617
And sometimes,
mostly because things

04:29.704 --> 04:32.881
are good with a boy.
You and Nate get back together?

04:32.968 --> 04:34.361
You mean, since
Gossip Girl published

04:34.448 --> 04:35.884
pictures of him
and some skank?

04:35.971 --> 04:37.451
So that's a no.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.367
What's Chuck doing today?

04:41.498 --> 04:42.804
Why are you asking me?

04:43.979 --> 04:45.807
Well, you guys are friends.

04:45.894 --> 04:48.723
And, Blair, look, you know
you can tell me anything.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.464
I'd be the last person
to judge anyone.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.030
With good reason.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.991
Blair, I saw you with Chuck.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.996
I don't know
what I was thinking.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.389
I mean, sleeping
with him once

05:02.476 --> 05:03.390
maybe you could understand,
but twice?

05:03.477 --> 05:04.652
Wait. You slept with him?

05:04.739 --> 05:06.044
- Shh!
- 'Ugh! Blair!'

05:06.131 --> 05:07.350
What happened to no judging?

05:07.437 --> 05:08.960
I'm not, but I thought
you wanted to wait.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.484
I thought you wanted
to make things special.

05:10.571 --> 05:11.702
Oh, so Nate
gets the free pass

05:11.789 --> 05:13.617
and I'm the slut?

05:13.704 --> 05:16.664
Tell me you didn't sleep
with Chuck for revenge.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.493
Well, it wasn't because I
like his natural musk.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.364
And besides, nothing
hurts more than

05:21.451 --> 05:23.975
sleeping with the best
friend. Right, S?

05:24.062 --> 05:25.063
Way to prove a point.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.414
Well, I learned from the master.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.763
If you're sleeping with Chuck

05:28.850 --> 05:30.504
I'd say the student's
become the master.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.940
Are you jealous...you didn't get

05:32.027 --> 05:33.811
to sleep with him first?

05:33.898 --> 05:36.553
There had to be somebody
left on the Upper East Side.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.470
[Eleanor]
Blair, darling, are you
going to help me at all?

05:40.557 --> 05:42.690
Serena, do you know when
your mother's arriving?

05:44.082 --> 05:45.606
She's not.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.782
We're not doing
Thanksgiving here anymore.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.305
Oh. Why?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.307
Because I uninvited them.

05:52.264 --> 05:55.180
[instrumental music]

05:57.792 --> 05:59.271
Happy holidays, Eleanor.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.802
[Serena]
'Mom, I know it's my
fault that we're here'

06:07.889 --> 06:09.456
'but let's not get crazy.'

06:09.543 --> 06:10.761
Well, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.197
I'm just trying
to provide my family

06:12.284 --> 06:13.851
with a home-cooked meal.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.549
You don't know howto cook.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.899
Well, don't blame me,
talk to your sister.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.553
She's the one that got us
exiled from the Waldorf's.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.163
Mom, I'm sorry.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.947
And even if you did cook,
we don't have an oven.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.949
Preaching to the converted,
Eric.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.648
Look, we'll just pick up
a few things and try to make do.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.389
Like Peking duck
on Thanksgiving.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.781
[Lily]
'Hmm, not a bad idea.'

06:30.868 --> 06:31.869
[Serena]
'No, mom.'

06:31.956 --> 06:33.480
All the other shops are closed.

06:33.567 --> 06:34.959
There's nothing
wrong with having

06:35.046 --> 06:36.787
Chinese food
on Thanksgiving.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.877
Jews have been doing it
on Christmas since forever.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.706
Look, a pumpkin.
Isn't this..

06:42.793 --> 06:44.665
This is festive, yes?

06:44.752 --> 06:46.623
We're gonna eat a pumpkin?

06:47.885 --> 06:48.886
Mom.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.584
Oh.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.152
So you couldn't make
it past the salad, huh?

06:54.239 --> 06:57.025
I opened the cranberries.
My work is done.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.243
How's Blair's?

06:58.330 --> 06:59.375
Uh, I wouldn't know.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.898
She gave me the boot.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.031
Wha.. She kicked you
out of her house?

07:03.118 --> 07:05.773
- What happened now?
- Uh, don't ask.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.298
But the good news is, my mom
is gonna slice us up a pumpkin.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.082
- Oh, and there's a duck.
- No, no, no.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.389
You can't eat...
duck and raw pumpkin

07:13.476 --> 07:14.825
on Thanksgiving.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.698
Uh, you know what?

07:17.785 --> 07:19.351
I'm the guardian
of Vanessa's sister's van

07:19.439 --> 07:21.179
for the weekend, and we
here at the Humphrey manor

07:21.266 --> 07:23.878
have an oddly
large kitchen table.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.533
- What are you suggesting?
- These smell great.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.839
Yes, so we can starve
in a fragrant hotel room.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.188
[Serena]
We're not starving.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.407
Look, I got us into this mess

07:31.494 --> 07:33.148
so I'm gonna get us out of it.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.932
Elaborate, Serena.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.804
Thanksgiving at the Humphreys.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.241
Dan invited me and Eric's
friends with his sister

07:39.328 --> 07:40.938
and his dad's really cool.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.331
[Eric]
'Awesome.
I'm leaving the pumpkin.'

07:42.418 --> 07:44.289
What do you say, mom?

07:44.376 --> 07:46.117
[chuckling]

07:47.075 --> 07:48.032
[chuckling]

07:50.644 --> 07:52.907
[instrumental music]

07:57.651 --> 08:00.349
Found it! Sous-chef,
you're needed.

08:00.436 --> 08:03.221
- Ready and awaiting orders.
- I see we have extra help.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.615
Yes, well, Serena's spending
Thanksgiving with us this year.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.009
Ah, the more the merrier.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.185
- Happy to have you, my dear.
- Whoo! Yes.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.362
The canapeswere a hugesuccess.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.798
I saved one for you, Blair.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.887
I'm not really hungry.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.715
Well, what does that mean,
you're not really hungry?

08:18.802 --> 08:21.196
Well, I had, like, 15
of them this morning

08:21.283 --> 08:22.240
'when daddy first made them.'

08:22.327 --> 08:24.460
Fifteen?

08:24.547 --> 08:27.463
- Serena. Serena.
- Do you think that's wise?

08:27.550 --> 08:28.986
Hey, darling, she's fine.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.945
'She has been for two months.'

08:31.032 --> 08:32.337
What did the doctor say?

08:32.424 --> 08:34.992
Don't drive us crazy, okay?

08:35.079 --> 08:37.429
- So, please.
- Ah, fine.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.476
Uh, we are going to need to set
another place at the table.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.347
Laurel brought one
of the models I'm working with.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.436
Ha! Do I know her?
What's her name?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.309
His name...is Roman.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.572
Ah. Roman.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.269
Not this one, Harold.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.534
We have to work together.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.318
[Nate]
Hey, you.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.146
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.626
- Want one?
- Good to see you. Ah, sure.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.584
- Good boy.
- Nate the great.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.543
- Mm, so what'd I miss?
- 'Mm, nothing.'

09:03.630 --> 09:05.283
You're about to witness
the return of sober Serena.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.895
- Ah, Nate!
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

09:07.982 --> 09:09.810
Or maybe not. Sweetie,
would you take her upstairs?

09:09.897 --> 09:11.159
'Put her in the bath
before your mother'

09:11.246 --> 09:12.464
'gets wind of this
whole situation?'

09:12.552 --> 09:14.423
What, and leave you all alone?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.773
Thanksgiving is our thing.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.993
Nate, will you please
take care of her?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.908
- 'Please?'
- Oh, I will.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.344
Come on.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.695
[Blair]
'Daddy, can I help
with the pumpkin pie?'

09:25.782 --> 09:26.696
[Harold]
'Of course.'

09:28.393 --> 09:29.438
- Thank you.
- Crush them.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.353
Thank you very much.
Crush them.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.357
Caterers?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.143
What's going on here?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.668
Everyone is getting ready
for our lovely dinner

09:41.755 --> 09:43.147
and you should be too.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.541
Everyone except daddy.
Where is he?

09:46.629 --> 09:48.326
I thought you knew.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.458
Knew what?

09:49.545 --> 09:51.721
Uh. Your father isn't coming.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.418
'He didn't tell you?'

09:53.505 --> 09:54.985
Uh!

09:55.072 --> 09:57.422
Well, he decided
to stay in Paris.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.076
He's got either
too much work

09:59.163 --> 10:01.949
or Roman is too much
work. Who knows?

10:02.036 --> 10:03.690
I-I don't understand,
if he wasn't coming

10:03.777 --> 10:05.387
why wouldn't he just
call me and tell me himself?

10:05.474 --> 10:06.997
Darling, you should know
by now that your father

10:07.084 --> 10:09.260
is not a fan
of the difficult conversation.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.088
Now, why don't you
run along and change into

10:11.175 --> 10:13.177
something a little
more, sss..

10:13.264 --> 10:14.744
...enchanting?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.269
'That's good.'

10:18.356 --> 10:21.229
[instrumental music]

10:24.145 --> 10:25.799
Are you sure you don't
want us to stay with you?

10:25.886 --> 10:27.844
Yeah, we don't wanna leave you,
mom, if you don't feel well.

10:27.931 --> 10:30.412
Oh, no.
You kids have fun.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.761
I don't have
an appetite anyway.

10:31.848 --> 10:32.806
[knocking on door]

10:32.893 --> 10:33.850
Oh, hold on a second.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.243
That must be Dan.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.376
- Hey!
- Room service.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.552
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, sir.
You have the wrong room.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.077
Oh, no, you're early.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.905
- I lied.
- Mom.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.081
[Lily sighs]

10:47.168 --> 10:49.649
All I care about is that
you two are together.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.259
I don't want
to be an imposition.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.608
No.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.002
Man with van, at your service.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.351
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.964
Uh, bold choice of attire,
Mrs. Van der Woodsen

11:01.051 --> 11:02.662
Unless it's what they're wearing
on the runway these days.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.360
No, my mom sicked out because
she didn't want to be imposing.

11:05.447 --> 11:06.970
You know what, I am fine

11:07.057 --> 11:08.798
just curling up
and reading a good book.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.408
But you're supposed to be with
your family on Thanksgiving.

11:10.495 --> 11:13.237
Yeah, and Nicholas Sparks
is hardly family.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.546
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.634
'In fact, I'm not even asking.'

11:18.721 --> 11:20.244
You're coming with us.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.550
I'm adult-napping you.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.422
Fine, just...stop talking..

11:24.509 --> 11:25.772
...and I'll get ready.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.211
Make it snappy.
I'm double-parked. Thanks.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.691
[Rufus on voice mail]
'Hey, Rufus Humphrey.'

11:31.778 --> 11:33.649
'Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.'

11:33.736 --> 11:35.259
Rufus, it's Lily.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.522
Um, your very persistent son

11:37.609 --> 11:39.437
insisted that I
join you for dinner.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.832
I want to remind you
that my kids do not know

11:42.919 --> 11:44.573
that we are friendly

11:44.660 --> 11:47.184
and I would like
to keep it that way.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.273
That said..

11:49.360 --> 11:50.971
...I look forward to seeing you.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.582
[instrumental music]

11:53.669 --> 11:56.628
Uh! How could he
just blow me off?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.543
Thanksgiving is our ritual.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.980
You know, he didn't even call.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.243
How hard is it
to pick up the phone?

12:02.330 --> 12:06.987
Miss Blair, maybe you pick up
phone, call your papa.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.119
Maybe he tell you
the real story.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.556
Real story?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.342
With pearls.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.563
[instrumental music]

12:26.223 --> 12:28.573
Tastes good, mum.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.532
Thank God Citarella
was still open.

12:30.619 --> 12:33.404
I had to improvise since we were
dis-invited from the Waldorfs

12:33.491 --> 12:34.710
'at the last minute.'

12:39.671 --> 12:41.325
Just like I was
asked to step down

12:41.412 --> 12:42.936
from the committee
for the snowflake ball

12:43.023 --> 12:44.372
'and how I wasn't asked back'

12:44.459 --> 12:45.765
'to the Lincoln
Center Foundation.'

12:45.852 --> 12:47.027
I thought at least
your father's lawyer

12:47.114 --> 12:48.071
might join us for dessert.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.681
Mom, stop.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.900
You were all for
acting like nothing

12:50.987 --> 12:52.380
was wrong until it
landed on you.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.642
I forgot to call
the bail bondsman.

12:53.729 --> 12:54.948
Maybe he has nowhere to go.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.210
Mom, no one
is more mad than I am

12:56.297 --> 12:57.254
but this is not the right way.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.213
Nathaniel, I don't need you

12:59.300 --> 13:01.215
to fight this fight for me.

13:01.302 --> 13:04.174
[instrumental music]

13:09.440 --> 13:10.485
Where do you think you're going?

13:10.572 --> 13:12.008
[Nate]
'Anywhere but here.'

13:18.101 --> 13:20.887
[music continues]

13:23.759 --> 13:25.630
What's taking Dan
and Serena so long?

13:25.717 --> 13:27.458
- 'Hey, we're here.'
- There you are.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.460
You're lucky you made it
while the turkey's still hot.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.898
Mom, this is Serena,
and this is her brother Eric.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.508
It is so nice to meet you both.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.466
- It's nice to meet you too.
- 'Hi.'

13:35.553 --> 13:37.077
And this is their mother, Lily.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.950
[instrumental music]

13:42.343 --> 13:43.518
Happy Thanksgiving.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.441
Just in time, but I thought
you were gonna bring pie.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.531
I did, but it kinda
got run over by a taxi

13:56.618 --> 13:58.925
uh, as I was trying to help
this girl stay out of traffic.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.665
Ah, well, who needs
dessert when we have

14:00.752 --> 14:02.058
a real-life hero
in our midst?

14:02.145 --> 14:03.494
Your brother
just saved a girl.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.844
I thought you had
to be near a girl

14:04.931 --> 14:06.236
'for that to happen.'

14:06.323 --> 14:08.151
Not just any girl. The girl.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.587
Oh, the blond
you stalk at school?

14:09.674 --> 14:11.502
- 'Just the one.'
- A thing for blonds.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.287
You are your father's son.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.028
Not just any blond.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.073
Apparently, I like
the ones who get drunk

14:17.160 --> 14:18.335
on Thanksgiving and almost die.

14:18.422 --> 14:19.423
Well, your dad liked 'em

14:19.510 --> 14:20.642
dangerous and troubled too.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.209
- 'So..'
- You were dangerous?

14:22.296 --> 14:24.428
Who said I was talking about me?

14:24.515 --> 14:26.039
Well, I didn't realize
there was anyone else.

14:28.389 --> 14:31.044
Well, it is so nice to meet you.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.784
Alison, right?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.482
It's nice to meet you too.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.353
- Lily, was it?
- Yes.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.617
Well, I'm just
gonna take these coats

14:39.704 --> 14:43.012
and put them in,
um...Dan's room.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.493
Uh, you know what?
It's okay. I've got them.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.408
Oh.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.064
Oh, thank you.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.501
Okay, Eric and Jenny,
napkin duty.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.329
'Serena and Dan, I want
every water glass filled'

14:55.416 --> 14:57.374
'and every candle
you can find lit.'

14:57.461 --> 14:59.899
I am sorry. I did not
know that you were--

14:59.986 --> 15:02.118
Back? Well, I am.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.426
And why would you know?

15:05.513 --> 15:09.691
Well, Dan never mentioned it
when he invited me.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.259
- I called.
- I didn't hear the phone.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.785
You know what? It's fine.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.482
It's fine. Let's just
have a great time.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.223
- 'The holiday's about sharing.'
- Right.

15:20.310 --> 15:23.270
And if you don't mind, um,
could we not share too much?

15:23.357 --> 15:25.707
'I haven't exactly told
my kids about my past.'

15:25.794 --> 15:28.797
Well...our past.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.886
[Dan]
Hey, turkey's almost
room temp, guys.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.235
Come on down.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.715
Grab the mashed.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.677
- Uh.
- 'I got that.'

15:41.679 --> 15:43.116
Happy Thanksgiving.

15:43.203 --> 15:46.075
[indistinct chattering]

15:55.867 --> 15:57.043
Blair.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.393
You haven't
touched your food.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.351
Come on, darling.
What has gotten into you?

16:02.831 --> 16:05.486
Well, I was going
to wait till after dinner

16:05.573 --> 16:07.575
but I guess now
is as good a time as any.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.534
Did you call daddy
and say that

16:10.621 --> 16:11.796
I didn't want to see him
this Thanksgiving?

16:11.883 --> 16:13.537
Of course not.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.583
What a ridiculous accusation.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.194
So you didn't tell him that I
was so angry at him for leaving

16:18.281 --> 16:20.196
that I didn't even
want to talk to him today?

16:20.283 --> 16:21.371
[sighs]

16:22.764 --> 16:25.027
You had no right
to un-invite him.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.377
When are you gonna
get it through your head?

16:27.464 --> 16:29.684
- He left us.
- He didn't leave us.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.642
- He left you.
- That's enough.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.779
That's enough.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.476
If you want to take
this up with me

16:39.563 --> 16:42.436
we can discuss it later,
after our guests have left.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.525
Right now you either eat
or you leave the table.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.614
I told you, I'm not hungry.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.922
Or maybe dessert
will change your mind.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.750
- Where is daddy's pie?
- Hmm?

16:52.837 --> 16:54.883
- Care for dessert, sir?
- I don't see his pumpkin pie.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.711
Well, there were so
many delicious choices

16:56.798 --> 16:58.191
coming from the caterer

16:58.278 --> 17:00.715
we just sent that one
down to the doorman.

17:00.802 --> 17:03.022
'What is Thanksgiving
after all, hmm?'

17:04.849 --> 17:08.114
'Now choose one
of those amazing desserts.'

17:14.903 --> 17:16.035
Hmm.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.691
[instrumental music]

17:39.014 --> 17:40.146
[door closes]

17:42.278 --> 17:45.151
[music continues]

[clattering]

18:14.093 --> 18:17.008
[instrumental music]

18:21.100 --> 18:23.014
[Dan]
So, uh, Mrs. Van der Woodsen

18:23.102 --> 18:25.321
um, what were Thanksgivings
like when you were growing up?

18:25.408 --> 18:26.844
Serena said you were
raised in California?

18:26.931 --> 18:29.412
Oh, I grew up on a little
ranch in Montecito.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.892
I didn't know there
were little ranches.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.633
There aren't.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.851
[all laughing]

18:34.983 --> 18:36.289
[cell phone ringing]

18:38.334 --> 18:40.075
Hey, I don't wanna be rude,
but I should take this.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.903
[Dan]
'Yeah, sure.'

18:41.990 --> 18:43.426
Hey, we're right
in the middle of di..

18:45.167 --> 18:47.604
Yeah. Of-of course.
I'm on my way.

18:47.691 --> 18:48.692
What's up?

18:48.779 --> 18:50.216
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.304
Is everything alright?

18:51.391 --> 18:53.436
No, but, um,
it will be, I hope.

18:53.523 --> 18:54.959
I'm sorry. I can't
really say more.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.787
- But it's nothing about us.
- Okay.

18:56.874 --> 18:57.788
I was having
a lot of fun, though.

18:57.875 --> 18:58.920
Alright.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.095
Bye.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.879
[indistinct song]

19:01.966 --> 19:03.359
[indistinct whispering]

19:03.446 --> 19:05.144
Oh, of course.
You're such a good friend.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.798
Look, um, I hope you don't mind,
but my daughter has to go.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.670
- Do you need to go with her?
- 'No, no, no, mom. Stay.'

19:09.757 --> 19:12.412
Have fun, please. Thanks, guys.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.805
[Serena]
It was nice to meet you.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.373
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah, uh, yeah.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.983
I don't think it has
anything to do with her.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.638
But, um, you were
talking about your ranch.

19:21.725 --> 19:22.813
Did you have any horses?

19:22.900 --> 19:24.641
Yes, I had a few.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.991
Um, I had my own, Rosewood.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.123
My dad has a song
called "Rosewood."

19:28.210 --> 19:29.820
Oh, but, no, not that rosewood.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.257
[Dan]
'I completely forgot
about that song.'

19:31.344 --> 19:32.867
Yeah, it's about
my mom, you know?

19:32.954 --> 19:34.390
''Cause she had this perfume
that she always wore.'

19:34.477 --> 19:35.783
- 'And it was rose and..'
- 'Sandalwood.'

19:35.870 --> 19:37.828
Sandalwood. It was like
her own personal scent.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.353
I'm a fool.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.311
[whispering]
You're not a fool.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.533
[instrumental music]

19:50.754 --> 19:52.887
Um, raise your hand
if you're over 30

19:52.974 --> 19:55.455
and acting really
weird right now.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.152
[Lily chuckles]
'I'm sorry, Alison.'

19:57.239 --> 19:58.980
'I never told Rufus
about that horse.'

19:59.067 --> 20:01.461
So I'm sure it's
just a coincidence.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.463
[Dan]
Wait a minute here.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.421
Why are you talking
like you know each other?

20:07.075 --> 20:08.990
Do you two know each other?

20:13.299 --> 20:16.432
Uh, we kinda did know each
other, a long, long time ago.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.739
- What?
- Know each other how?

20:19.957 --> 20:22.830
[music continues]

20:26.094 --> 20:27.530
Oh, my God.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.839
This is unbelievable.
You know what? I need some air.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.449
Don't follow me.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.718
You have a lot
of explaining to do.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.504
'Mom, wait.'

20:44.591 --> 20:46.419
- May we please be excused?
- Yeah, sure.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.556
[music continues]

20:53.643 --> 20:54.775
[door slams shut]

20:55.732 --> 20:57.473
[music continues]

21:03.262 --> 21:04.915
[instrumental music]

21:05.873 --> 21:07.483
[Nate laughing]

21:07.570 --> 21:08.963
Watch it. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.312
I don't want a bath.

21:10.399 --> 21:13.010
Oh, too bad.
Blair's direct orders.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.404
- Blair's not the boss of me.
- Sit. Oh, are you new here?

21:15.491 --> 21:18.015
'Cause Blair's
the boss of all of us.

21:18.102 --> 21:20.496
Oh, seriously, Serena, you smell
like the floor of a brewery.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.760
- I do not.
- Yes, you do. Mmm.

21:23.847 --> 21:27.111
- Oh, my God. Yes, I do.
- Ha ha. Yeah.

21:27.198 --> 21:30.898
Brewery floor with
a hint of secondhand smoke?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.203
[both laughing]

21:32.291 --> 21:33.292
And a pint of Old Spice.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.032
- Whoa.
- I totally need a bath.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.470
Yeah, deal with it.
Please.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.167
Blair's a bossy genius.

21:39.254 --> 21:41.561
Oh, yes, she is. Mmm.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.128
So, what about you?

21:44.215 --> 21:45.782
What about me? I don't
smell like an ashtray.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.916
But you look
like an ass tray.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.787
Hey, Serena.
Stop, stop, stop.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.920
Stop, Serena.
Serena, stop.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.661
What's wrong with you?
Uh, uh..

21:54.748 --> 21:56.489
Oh. Oh..

21:56.576 --> 21:57.925
Oh.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.448
- Ba-a-ah! Ha ha!
- Ah! Go away!

21:59.535 --> 22:00.841
Oh, what, what, what?

22:00.928 --> 22:03.191
You started it, dude.
You started it.

22:04.235 --> 22:05.541
What are you guys doing?

22:06.455 --> 22:07.761
Ha ha ha.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.023
Uh..

22:10.459 --> 22:11.547
Um..

22:12.635 --> 22:14.550
A-a-ah!

22:14.637 --> 22:16.204
My hair!

22:16.291 --> 22:19.207
[screaming]

22:20.600 --> 22:23.516
[indistinct shouting]

22:23.603 --> 22:25.735
I'm king of the world!

22:28.782 --> 22:31.654
[instrumental music]

22:33.395 --> 22:35.092
[cell phone keys beeping]

22:52.719 --> 22:54.373
[knocking on door]

22:54.460 --> 22:56.375
[Serena]
'Hey, it's me.'

22:59.334 --> 23:02.250
[instrumental music]

23:03.643 --> 23:05.471
[crying]

23:05.558 --> 23:07.473
I didn't mean for it to happen.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
I didn't see your
dad downstairs.

23:24.794 --> 23:28.450
My mother just decides
everything, you know?

23:28.537 --> 23:30.931
Everything in the world
is just totally up to her.

23:33.368 --> 23:34.500
I know.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.813
Hey, why don't
we get out of here?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.989
I'm not going back
to that party.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.904
No, I mean, outta here,
outta here.

23:47.991 --> 23:51.038
Out of this apartment,
to a place a little more sane.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.389
[sighs]

23:54.476 --> 23:56.435
Any place would qualify.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.660
So you actually threatened
Lily van der Woodsen

24:04.747 --> 24:06.532
with physical violence?

24:06.619 --> 24:08.577
Mom, you are a badass.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.013
[Alison]
Yeah, well, what can I say?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.450
I was younger then

24:11.537 --> 24:13.321
and wearing steel-toed boots.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.801
[chuckles]
No, no. No.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.672
We never actually
came too close.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.414
I focused on transforming

24:19.501 --> 24:22.635
my anger into art.
I made some collages.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.811
I wrote a trilogy
of one-act plays about her

24:24.898 --> 24:27.422
named the character Milly
to try to be, you know, subtle.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.033
It's clever.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.951
So what was so bad about her?

24:35.038 --> 24:36.736
'And I mean aside
from the superior'

24:36.823 --> 24:38.955
fluttering eyelids
and punishing sarcasm.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.437
Well, uh, she
was your dad's

24:42.524 --> 24:44.831
first great love..

24:44.918 --> 24:47.398
'...as she liked to remind me
every chance she got.'

24:47.486 --> 24:49.226
[instrumental music]

24:49.313 --> 24:50.967
It's kinda hard
to compete with that.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.927
[music continues]

24:58.975 --> 25:00.977
You've, uh, been
in here for a half hour.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.805
Yeah, well, not nearly
enough time to fathom

25:02.892 --> 25:05.155
how you allowed me
to walk into this situation.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.941
Allowed you? Th..

25:08.028 --> 25:09.333
You were the last
person I expected

25:09.420 --> 25:10.813
to come through
my front door today.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.423
Yeah, well,
at the very least you knew

25:12.511 --> 25:14.251
that Serena would come
home and tell me all about

25:14.338 --> 25:16.645
the wonderful Thanksgiving
she had with Dan

25:16.732 --> 25:19.430
his father, oh, and his mother.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.696
Is this really how you think
I deserve to find out?

25:23.783 --> 25:27.743
I don't know...what I
do or do not owe you.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.703
I mean, we haven't
actually defined..

25:30.790 --> 25:32.705
...what we are
to each other.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.927
Well, maybe this is the perfect
opportunity to do it.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.626
But, Lily..

25:40.713 --> 25:42.584
...these past few weeks have..

25:45.195 --> 25:46.893
Have been what?

25:50.679 --> 25:52.507
You can't even
say it, can you?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.640
I can..

25:54.727 --> 25:56.119
...but I shouldn't.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.864
Look, for better or for worse..

26:01.951 --> 26:03.387
...you're one
of my oldest friends.

26:03.474 --> 26:06.390
Hmm. Oldest friends?

26:06.477 --> 26:08.218
That's certainly not how
it felt when you kissed me

26:08.305 --> 26:09.655
at Eleanor's party.

26:10.743 --> 26:11.700
What?

26:13.528 --> 26:14.964
Oh!

26:15.051 --> 26:17.401
Alison, honey..

26:17.488 --> 26:18.620
Dan, will you go and..

26:18.707 --> 26:21.580
Uh, check on Jenny and Eric.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.668
Yeah.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.894
- 'Mom, where's dad?'
- 'How dare you do that?'

26:31.981 --> 26:33.983
[Anne]
'Leave in the middle
of Thanksgiving dinner?'

26:34.070 --> 26:35.463
[Nate]
'I need to talk to dad.'

26:35.550 --> 26:38.553
Dad? Dad?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.468
Oh, my God. Dad. Dad!

26:40.555 --> 26:42.818
Mom, call 911! Hurry!

26:42.905 --> 26:44.211
Dad, please, wake up. Dad!

26:47.606 --> 26:48.519
[Serena]
'Dorita.'

26:48.607 --> 26:50.696
[laughing]

26:50.783 --> 26:52.219
Easy.

26:52.306 --> 26:53.350
- Take a seat, honey.
- Oh, goodness.

26:53.437 --> 26:54.917
Oh, how do I smell now?

26:55.004 --> 26:56.353
Uh, you smell fantastic

26:56.440 --> 26:58.138
but you might not wanna
keep asking people that.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.487
Serena, you look wonderful.

26:59.574 --> 27:00.619
That shirt was made for you.

27:00.706 --> 27:01.968
Actually, it was made for you.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.839
Well, I knew there
was a reason I liked it.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.798
- Yours too, I see.
- And mine.

27:05.885 --> 27:07.538
- 'No, no, no.'
- Oh, no, no, no.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.975
Would you help me
with the potatoes?

27:09.062 --> 27:10.585
Yes. Ah!

27:11.281 --> 27:12.456
[laughing]

27:12.543 --> 27:14.023
Don't tell me it's a big deal.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.503
I'm well aware of the stakes.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.983
- Hey, who's dad talking to?
- 'What, now?'

27:17.070 --> 27:18.158
The office, something about that

27:18.245 --> 27:19.550
deal with the Dutch company.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.595
So it looks like I'll have

27:20.682 --> 27:22.075
to slip out for a few minutes.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.251
- Dad, it's a holiday.
- Not in Amsterdam.

27:24.338 --> 27:25.687
Well, we are in America.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.036
Tell them it will
wait till tomorrow.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.082
Sweetheart, I don't
want to go. I have to.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.564
I brought this deal in,
but if Meltzer closes it

27:33.652 --> 27:35.523
without me, I don't
get the commission.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.960
Forget the commission.
I'll write you a check myself.

27:38.047 --> 27:40.354
Sit. We're just about to eat.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.356
I think I just
lost my appetite.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.315
[instrumental music]

27:52.627 --> 27:55.543
[indistinct announcement on PA]

27:57.371 --> 27:59.765
Your father and his headaches.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.942
Probably took
the Vicodin and forgot.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.552
Had some whiskey,
and the next thing--

28:04.639 --> 28:07.381
Mom, seriously, did you hear
anything the doctor said?

28:07.468 --> 28:09.600
'With what he took, he
could've cured 30 headaches.'

28:11.428 --> 28:12.691
Mom, he's got a problem

28:12.778 --> 28:14.301
'and ignoring it
almost killed him.'

28:14.388 --> 28:18.522
- Oh, no. This is not my fault.
- I'm not blaming anybody.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.133
You can blame whoever
you want, just not me.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.309
'All I'm guilty of is
trying to make his life easier.'

28:22.396 --> 28:25.007
Easier? You've made
his life impossible.

28:25.094 --> 28:26.313
What do you mean?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.749
He's had everything
he ever wanted

28:27.836 --> 28:29.359
just handed to him.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.057
My father set him up
with his own firm.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.059
'He gave us the house that
we live in, the Hamptons'

28:33.146 --> 28:34.887
the boat. He's never
had to earn a dime.

28:34.974 --> 28:38.107
And how do you think that's
working out for him, mom, huh?

28:38.194 --> 28:40.588
Wake up!

28:40.675 --> 28:42.677
All he had to do
was sit behind a desk

28:42.764 --> 28:44.548
put on a suit
and not get arrested

28:44.635 --> 28:46.463
and he couldn't
manage to do that.

28:46.550 --> 28:49.162
'You want me to give him more
responsibility in the family?'

28:49.249 --> 28:50.598
[sighs]

28:50.685 --> 28:53.557

28:53.644 --> 28:55.429
Look, I don't know
what the answer is.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.779
But we can't keep
going on like this..

28:57.866 --> 28:59.563
...or else we'll lose him.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.218
[female #1]
Excuse me.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.960
Sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. Archibald is awake.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.179
'He was asking for you.'

29:06.266 --> 29:07.615
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.792
[instrumental music]

29:11.924 --> 29:13.273
I'll go see how he's doing.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.491
No.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.015
I will.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.715
[music continues]

29:23.805 --> 29:25.415
[Rufus]
I'm not saying you're
overreacting per se

29:25.502 --> 29:26.460
just having a reaction
that is above

29:26.547 --> 29:27.766
and beyond
what is appropriate.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.158
I have been killing
myself trying

29:29.245 --> 29:30.507
to make up for what
happened in Hudson.

29:30.594 --> 29:31.944
Which is not
an overreaction, I might add.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.162
And then I find out
that the two of you

29:33.249 --> 29:34.381
are making out
at theme parties?

29:34.468 --> 29:36.426
Ah, it was hardly making out

29:36.513 --> 29:37.906
and there is an explanation.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.561
Hey, guys, I'm back,
and I brought...Blair.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.563
[Blair]
'Hey.'

29:42.650 --> 29:44.695
Wow. Weird vibe.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.350
Okay.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.875
Where's Dan?

29:49.962 --> 29:51.050
There's no chance
we're related, right?

29:51.137 --> 29:52.442
Oh, look at Eric's roots.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.661
What do you mean?
What's wrong with my roots?

29:53.748 --> 29:55.184
They're kind of Rufus-like.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.534
- 'Hey.'
- Serena and Blair.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.710
- Blair?
- Yeah, it's me.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.886
Explanation to follow,
but first

30:00.973 --> 30:02.931
what's going on
with our parents?

30:03.018 --> 30:04.715
Oh, uh, our dad
dated your mom.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.934
Yeah, we're not
related, though.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.980
- What?
- Ignore my roots.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.808
Wait. Wait. What?

30:09.895 --> 30:11.635
[Blair]
You know what's really weird?

30:11.722 --> 30:13.159
There's a garage door

30:13.246 --> 30:15.552
in the middle of your room.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.859
Oh. Is that Cedric?

30:17.946 --> 30:19.339
Wow. This day
just got a lot worse.

30:19.426 --> 30:21.428
Hold on. How serious
were they, our parents?

30:21.515 --> 30:24.648
Uh, I think it's safe to say
that they have had sex.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.259
- Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
- 'Yeah.'

30:26.346 --> 30:28.827
- No, I'm gonna faint.
- To repeat, we are not related.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.916
She was a groupie,
and he was almost famous.

30:31.003 --> 30:33.266
Suddenly, my family
seems so sane.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.311
This is too much to handle
on an empty stomach.

30:35.398 --> 30:37.052
Well, we're not
going back out there..

30:37.139 --> 30:39.228
Well, can we leave
here then, please?

30:39.315 --> 30:42.492
Escape. I don't know. Maybe eat?

30:42.579 --> 30:44.364
[Dan]
That's why they
call it a fire escape.

30:44.451 --> 30:45.756
I think we're splitting
hairs here, Rufus.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.019
An emotional affair
is just as bad

30:47.106 --> 30:48.629
as a, as a physical one.

30:48.716 --> 30:49.804
[Lily]
'Oh, please,
nobody's buying that.'

30:49.891 --> 30:51.066
Emotional affairs are necessary

30:51.153 --> 30:52.372
to keep a marriage alive.

30:52.459 --> 30:53.982
And how many times
have you been divorced?

30:54.069 --> 30:55.984
[Rufus]
Alison, this is not about Lily.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.899
- This is about you and me.
- Exactly.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.293
And if we're gonna have any
chance, then she can't be here.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.121
What, for Thanksgiving?

31:02.208 --> 31:03.383
Or ever?

31:05.080 --> 31:06.560
Oh, you can't be serious.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.301
[Alison]
I am.

31:08.388 --> 31:11.304
Look, I have made mistakes,
and I know that.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.132
'But if she's in your life'

31:13.219 --> 31:14.481
'you're never
gonna get over her.'

31:14.568 --> 31:16.309
- Alison.
- This is it, Rufus, okay?

31:16.396 --> 31:17.963
If you wanna make this work

31:18.050 --> 31:19.965
then you have to make a choice.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.924
[instrumental music]

31:32.455 --> 31:34.283
she's been riding me
about my behavior.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.981
And here she's just
mad at you for being her.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.765
The whole time, my dad has
been giving me this advice

31:37.852 --> 31:39.593
based on this girl
he dated.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.987
- This girl, a lot like Serena.
- It's her mom.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.379
When you think about it,
it makes total sense

31:43.466 --> 31:44.554
that your mom was a groupie.

31:44.641 --> 31:45.642
'I mean, only a woman that had'

31:45.729 --> 31:46.905
completely satisfied her

31:46.992 --> 31:48.080
sexual appetite in her youth

31:48.167 --> 31:49.690
would ever marry
your stepdads.

31:49.777 --> 31:51.344
Blair, can we not talk
about mom's appetite?

31:51.431 --> 31:52.693
Yeah, or who,
or who satisfied it.

31:52.780 --> 31:53.955
- It's just..
- So..

31:54.042 --> 31:55.522
- Gross.
- Yeah.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.873
Hi.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.831
- Hey, mom.
- Is everything okay?

32:02.485 --> 32:04.923
Yeah. Hmm.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.489
Do you, do you wanna go home?
We could call a car.

32:06.576 --> 32:07.751
No, no, not yet.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.840
Um, I need fries.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.799
Excuse me. Could I
get some French fries?

32:11.886 --> 32:13.496
And just
keep 'em coming.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.063
[female #2]
'Sure. Coming right up.'

32:17.022 --> 32:18.197
Uh, we should, Jenny
and I should probably

32:18.284 --> 32:19.807
head back to the loft.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.116
I'm gonna go too.
Leave you guys alone.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.291
Bye.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.860
[Blair]
S.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.993
Thank you...for today.

32:32.559 --> 32:33.560
Hmm.

32:33.647 --> 32:34.953
The sandwich was delicious.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.911
I'm calling
Dr. Sherman tomorrow.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.089
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:41.176 --> 32:44.049
[instrumental music]

32:46.790 --> 32:47.791
[chuckles]

32:47.878 --> 32:49.576
Is that really necessary, mom?

32:49.663 --> 32:51.273
From what I hear, you have been

32:51.360 --> 32:53.667
in places far dirtier than this.

32:54.798 --> 32:55.799
Well..

32:55.886 --> 32:57.497
[chuckles]
...please.

32:59.629 --> 33:03.372
Try spending nine hours
with Jane's Addiction

33:03.459 --> 33:06.897
on the Ohio Turnpike.
Then we'll talk about dirty.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.812
[laughing]

33:08.899 --> 33:09.900
Okay.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.119
[laughs]

33:12.903 --> 33:14.775
[Dan]
See you later, Waldorf.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.955
So, uh, so today
was not boring.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.609
No.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.654
I never should have
asked mom to come home.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.006
But I didn't
see this coming.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.617
Who could've?
Don't worry about it.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.184
It's so weird to think
that our parents had lives

33:32.271 --> 33:33.489
before us, you know?

33:33.576 --> 33:34.708
I know, or that they had

33:34.795 --> 33:36.492
lives before each other, huh?

33:37.972 --> 33:40.496
Lily seemed pretty upset.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.890
I wonder what happened
while we were gone.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.805
Uh, I-I don't know

33:44.892 --> 33:46.676
but it looks like
we're about to find out.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.113
Hey, who's in
the mood for a little

33:48.200 --> 33:50.202
Humphrey family scrimmage?
What'll it be?

33:50.289 --> 33:52.117
Kids against the parents?
Boys against the girls?

33:52.204 --> 33:54.293
Oh, definitely girls against
the boys, because last year

33:54.380 --> 33:55.685
I got burned by Dan's
weak forward pass.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.252
Hey, hey..

33:57.339 --> 33:59.211
I was nursing a rotator cuff
injury from aught five.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.516
[scoffs]
Duh.

34:00.603 --> 34:01.909
Come on, mom, let's
go work out our plays.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.389
[Alison]
Yep.

34:04.564 --> 34:05.869
[sighs]

34:05.956 --> 34:07.393
So, uh, dad,
not that I'm

34:07.480 --> 34:08.959
not that I'm mad exactly

34:09.047 --> 34:11.701
but not telling me
about Serena's mom

34:11.788 --> 34:13.138
was extremely uncool.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.313
I should've said something

34:14.400 --> 34:16.445
I know...and I'm sorry.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.534
Given the ick factor alone,
I would say that you

34:18.621 --> 34:21.102
set my progress back
by at least several months.

34:21.189 --> 34:22.408
Oh, come on.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.149
You're a Humphrey man.

34:24.236 --> 34:27.152
No daughter of Lily's
could ever resist.

34:27.239 --> 34:30.024
How'd you leave it
back there with her?

34:30.111 --> 34:31.547
Well, I wouldn't be expecting

34:31.634 --> 34:33.506
Lil over for dinner
anytime soon.

34:33.593 --> 34:36.857
Your mom and I need to focus
on the future, not the past.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.381
And that's a lot easier for
all of us without her around.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.862
[instrumental music]

34:42.950 --> 34:45.561
Oh, well..

34:45.648 --> 34:47.694
...let's play with
the old pigskin then.

34:47.781 --> 34:50.653
[music continues]

34:58.487 --> 34:59.662
Mom.

35:01.011 --> 35:02.100
Here you are.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.753
And here you are.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.408
You had me worried sick.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.628
Blair, uh..

35:08.715 --> 35:12.806
I know I-I...shouldn't have
lied to you about your father.

35:12.893 --> 35:15.025
That never
stopped you before.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.636
True.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.203
But..

35:18.290 --> 35:20.248
...the real truth..

35:21.510 --> 35:24.383
Divorce papers...
from your father

35:24.470 --> 35:26.559
and I'm supposed
to sign them.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.648
- I haven't yet.
- Mom.

35:28.735 --> 35:31.172
[instrumental music]

35:31.259 --> 35:33.957
He's living in Europe..

35:34.044 --> 35:35.524
...with a man.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.355
You can't be all that surprised
that he wants a divorce.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.270
I'm not.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.967
But what I..

35:44.054 --> 35:46.492
...what I am surprised about
is how it makes me feel.

35:49.277 --> 35:51.497
He was my husband after all.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.065
He was my Harold..

35:56.415 --> 35:58.286
...for almost 20 years.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.030
I couldn't face him..

36:04.727 --> 36:08.122
...during the holidays.
It was always our happiest time.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.516
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

36:10.603 --> 36:12.779
And let you choose
between the two of us?

36:12.866 --> 36:14.607
I wonder who would've
won that battle.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.913
Yeah, I would've
been entirely alone.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.482
Well, uh, I was, anyway.

36:20.569 --> 36:21.657
[scoffs]

36:21.744 --> 36:24.617
[music continues]

36:41.199 --> 36:43.201
It's still Thanksgiving.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.245
Yeah.

36:44.332 --> 36:45.812
[both chuckle]

36:45.899 --> 36:47.683
What do you wanna do?

36:47.770 --> 36:50.512
[monitor beeping]

36:58.216 --> 37:00.870
- Hey.
- Hey, you're still here.

37:00.957 --> 37:03.177
'I guess I must've
fallen back asleep.'

37:03.264 --> 37:05.571
Yeah, you were, uh,
you were pretty out of it

37:05.658 --> 37:07.486
when I first came in.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.444
Where's your mom?

37:09.531 --> 37:11.446
She's getting coffee.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.015
How's your mom?

37:16.364 --> 37:18.236
She's gonna be alright.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.673
We all are.

37:24.111 --> 37:26.461
So..

37:26.548 --> 37:29.464
...Vicodin and whiskey, huh?

37:29.551 --> 37:31.336
I guess I forgot I took
that medicine when I--

37:31.423 --> 37:33.338
Dad, we're not
doing this anymore.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.384
Okay? We're just not.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.735
[instrumental music]

37:39.822 --> 37:42.085
- I know it wasn't an accident.
- Of course, it was.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.044
And when I found you,
I thought you were dead.

37:48.570 --> 37:49.963
I'm sorry.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.575
I just didn't..

37:53.662 --> 37:55.534
- I couldn't--
- Yes, you can.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.187
Dad, you have to, please.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.800
I know it might not
always feel that way, but..

38:04.282 --> 38:05.805
...we need you.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.198
[music continues]

38:08.286 --> 38:09.852
Dad, we need you.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.812
[music continues]

38:17.947 --> 38:19.993
[Blair laughing]

38:20.080 --> 38:22.778
- Here you go, Nate.
- Ah, thank you, Mr. Waldorf.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.432
- My dad will appreciate this.
- It's a pleasure.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.912
Keep out the gravy.
He's got high cholesterol.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.741
- Anne, it's Thanksgiving.
- Mom, seriously.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.699
- Give the man some gravy.
- It's okay.

38:30.786 --> 38:31.831
- Happy Thanksgiving.
