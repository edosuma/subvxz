00:33.801 --> 00:35.102
I don't care where he is.
Find him.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.369
It's urgent.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.004
Yes, I'll hold.

00:45.713 --> 00:49.015
<i>He's been locked up</i>
<i>for almost a year</i>

00:49.050 --> 00:51.384
<i>and overnight they decide</i>
<i>to hold a trial</i>

00:51.419 --> 00:52.953
<i>and pronounce a death sentence?</i>

00:52.987 --> 00:54.721
What did you expect?

00:54.755 --> 00:56.990
Hasan blew up 129 civilians
in the marketplace in Ramadi.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.525
I know what he did.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.826
I also know he's got intel

00:59.861 --> 01:01.461
about an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

01:01.496 --> 01:02.729
He's been dangling
this so-called attack

01:02.763 --> 01:04.631
for the last three months.
Yeah.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.867
And now he'll come clean
if we commute his sentence.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.469
We don't dictate law
to the Iraqis anymore.

01:09.504 --> 01:10.937
This is their jurisdiction.

01:10.972 --> 01:12.105
And Hasan is their prisoner.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.174
David...

01:21.616 --> 01:22.816
Hold on a second.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.821
He's Abu Nazir's
bomb maker, David.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.223
Execute him now, and everything
he knows is gone forever.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.025
It's over.

01:32.059 --> 01:34.294
I'm on my way to the prison now.
At least petition JSOC.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.329
- Have them appeal to the Iraqi Army.
- JSOC can't do anything either.

01:36.364 --> 01:39.574
David, you're a CIA deputy
director-- you can do this.

01:40.189 --> 01:42.593
- I told you it's over.
- Please don't shut me down.

01:42.594 --> 01:44.811
David, Senator Feldman's
looking for you.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.273
- Tell him I'll be right there.
- David, please,

01:46.307 --> 01:47.874
this is
my last chance with Hasan.

01:47.909 --> 01:49.809
- Carrie, I have to go.
- David...

01:49.844 --> 01:51.344
I'm hanging up.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.926
Estes didn't go for it.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.127
I knew he wouldn't.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.099
Is that him?

02:13.134 --> 02:15.168
Yes.

02:15.203 --> 02:18.205
I'm not sure
we can trust him.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.673
Can he get me inside or not?

02:19.707 --> 02:21.007
He says he can.

02:26.047 --> 02:27.480
Now you have
only two minutes.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.182
Understand what I say--
two minutes.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.483
Ibrahim...

02:30.518 --> 02:33.887
I tried to get the
Agency to intervene,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.522
but they couldn't
do anything.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.990
I'm sorry.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.059
So I have nothing to say to you.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.360
Ibrahim, you said

02:40.394 --> 02:41.861
your family was in hiding,

02:41.896 --> 02:43.029
afraid for their lives.

02:43.064 --> 02:44.664
I can get them to Amman.

02:44.699 --> 02:46.533
Tell me what you know,

02:46.567 --> 02:49.869
and I will personally
guarantee their safety.

02:49.904 --> 02:52.739
Why should I believe
you will do what you say?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.541
We have to go.
You said two minutes.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.543
The guards, they are coming.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.311
I need more time.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.717
You don't believe me?

03:03.751 --> 03:06.119
Well, maybe I was wrong
to believe you.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.120
You said you were
an important man.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.488
You said you had information

03:08.522 --> 03:10.390
about an attack by Abu Nazir.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.392
- I have information.
- Prove it.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.494
Because unless you do,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.463
I won't protect your family.

03:22.737 --> 03:24.738
Please, we're out of time!

03:29.310 --> 03:30.343
My family!

03:31.779 --> 03:34.314
My family!
You promised to protect them!

05:01.035 --> 05:03.069
Last night, at 2300 GMT,

05:03.104 --> 05:05.238
one of our ground assets
produced a live lead

05:05.272 --> 05:07.907
on an enemy operating base
in the Korengal Valley.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.376
Nice of you
to join us, Carrie.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.177
How is it you are
the only analyst

05:11.212 --> 05:13.646
in this section that can't
get to a briefing on time?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.715
I wanted the whole
group to hear this.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.618
Within the hour,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.220
Delta Team
was on site.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.722
where they identified multiple
insurgents on our hit list.

05:22.757 --> 05:25.658
Minutes later, two UH-60
Blackhawk gunships

05:25.693 --> 05:28.528
lit the target with
over 8,000 rounds.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.663
All 13 hostiles
were confirmed kills.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.465
But, during the sweep,

05:32.500 --> 05:35.702
one of the deltas found
something else--

05:35.736 --> 05:39.205
a padlocked door
to an interior room.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.341
I wanted you
to see for yourselves.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.315
Get the fuck down!

05:49.350 --> 05:51.384
Get him on his feet!

05:54.321 --> 05:55.822
What did you say?

05:57.792 --> 06:00.660
I'm an American.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.531
Turns out he's one of ours.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.167
Marine Sergeant
Nicholas Brody.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.803
MIA since early 2003
and presumed dead--

06:09.837 --> 06:11.504
until now.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.773
What happened
to his partner?

06:13.808 --> 06:15.708
Brody was a scout sniper.
They work in pairs.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.877
Corporal Thomas Walker also
went missing that day.

06:17.912 --> 06:19.312
According to Sergeant Brody,

06:19.346 --> 06:21.147
Walker was killed
during their captivity.

06:21.182 --> 06:22.882
But that shouldn't dampen

06:22.917 --> 06:24.684
what is a major win
for the agency and for everyone

06:24.718 --> 06:27.020
in this room.
You should all take a moment--

06:27.054 --> 06:29.189
give yourselves
a big hand.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.825
Because of you, an American hero
is coming home.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.127
Good job.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.435
What were his exact
words, please?

07:15.469 --> 07:18.705
<i>An American prisoner of war</i>
<i>has been turned.</i>

07:18.739 --> 07:19.939
He said this
in English?

07:19.974 --> 07:21.241
Yes. He whispered it
into my ear

07:21.275 --> 07:22.575
right before the
guards pulled me away.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.244
And when he used
the expression "turned..."

07:24.278 --> 07:27.881
He meant turned--
working for Abu Nazir.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.439
Why am I just hearing
about this now?

07:29.464 --> 07:30.864
Because until ten minutes ago,

07:30.918 --> 07:34.087
I didn't know there were any P.O.W.'s
still alive in Iraq or Afghanistan.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.455
So you're suggesting
that Abu Nazir...

07:39.560 --> 07:42.161
You're suggesting
that Abu Nazir

07:42.196 --> 07:44.631
planted intelligence in
his own safe house

07:44.665 --> 07:47.133
just so we could recover
Sergeant Brody?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.235
I realize it sounds
like a reach.

07:49.270 --> 07:51.905
To say the least.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.540
Why not just drop him
near a checkpoint

07:53.574 --> 07:55.174
and make it look
like he escaped.

07:55.209 --> 07:56.576
Why would you sacrifice
13 trained fighters?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.710
Because Abu Nazir

07:57.745 --> 07:59.078
is playing the long game.

07:59.113 --> 08:00.413
This way, no one
suspects a thing.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.581
Except you.
Yeah, except me.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.216
Yeah.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.384
And Sergeant Brody's due home

08:04.418 --> 08:05.818
from Germany tomorrow morning,

08:05.853 --> 08:08.112
which gives us
just under 22 hours.

08:08.137 --> 08:09.288
To do what?

08:09.610 --> 08:12.973
To authorize a
surveillance package.

08:12.974 --> 08:15.124
To tap his phones,
wire his house,

08:15.125 --> 08:16.685
follow him wherever he goes.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.353
David will never sign off
on that and you know it.

08:18.378 --> 08:19.399
Of course he won't.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.267
The White House needs
a poster boy for the war,

08:21.302 --> 08:22.867
and David just served
him up on a platter.

08:22.869 --> 08:23.919
That's why I'm coming to you.

08:23.944 --> 08:25.638
I'm not going over his
head, not on a hunch.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.041
But if I'm right,
if he is a terrorist,

08:28.075 --> 08:30.507
we need eyes and ears
on Brody from the minute

08:30.532 --> 08:31.678
he steps off the plane.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.477
- Never happen.
- But...

08:32.513 --> 08:35.815
Out of the question.
Carrie...

08:38.719 --> 08:40.720
All right, fine.
What do I have to do?

08:44.258 --> 08:46.693
Prove that the safe house
leak was planted.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.861
Or at least give me a reason
to doubt its authenticity.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.663
I'm in the penalty box, Saul.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.832
I'm 5,000 miles away
from my contacts.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.068
I can't collect intelligence
from behind a desk.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.769
Find a way.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.441
No, don't look at me that way.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.277
We're all fighting
the same enemy here.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.800
We're ready for you,
Sergeant Brody.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.272
Your debriefing.

09:33.307 --> 09:37.243
I want to call my wife first.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.927
Oh, I think that's mine.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.896
Oh, no. Oh...

10:29.930 --> 10:32.065
Don't get it. Don't.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.167
It might be one
of my kids.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.006
Hello.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.474
Jessica?

10:43.177 --> 10:45.878
It's me. Brody.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.283
Brody?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.656
Come on, Jess,
talk to me.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.357
What do you want me to say?

10:58.392 --> 11:00.026
Tell me that you're okay.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.195
I'm not okay.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.530
I'm a long way from okay.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.800
Hey.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.303
Mom!

11:44.338 --> 11:46.539
Where's your sister?

11:46.573 --> 11:48.307
I thought you were
at the movies with Jody.

11:48.342 --> 11:50.476
Dana!
Is she in her room?

11:50.511 --> 11:51.711
Mom...
Come with me. Dana?!

11:51.745 --> 11:53.379
Mom, just wait
a second.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.847
Come on. I have some
incredible news for you guys.

11:54.882 --> 11:55.915
Mom! Come on, Mom!

11:55.949 --> 11:57.750
Dana!
Mom, don't go in there!

11:57.785 --> 12:01.487
Mom, just...
Tried to stop her.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.557
How come you're home so early?

12:04.591 --> 12:05.558
Who is he?

12:05.592 --> 12:07.960
Xander.
Xander...

12:07.995 --> 12:09.595
you need to leave
right now.

12:09.630 --> 12:11.697
I'll text you later.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.167
Xan, your jacket.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.674
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this, Mom?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.810
Gee, Dana, I don't know, it's
either the lying or the drugs.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.878
You're supposed to be looking
after your brother.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.547
Well, he didn't
burn down the house.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.815
Why don't you just do what
you say you're gonna do

12:28.849 --> 12:30.383
for a change? What?
Mom!

12:30.417 --> 12:32.485
You said you had something
important to tell us.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.086
Shit!

12:34.121 --> 12:36.022
What, Ma?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.524
Come here, you two.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.573
Touchdown in
about two hours.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.007
You need anything?

12:55.042 --> 12:57.443
No, I'm good. Thanks.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.546
You'll have some time
with your family first.

13:00.581 --> 13:02.682
Then you'll meet
the Vice President,

13:02.716 --> 13:04.584
who'll introduce you to
every major media outlet

13:04.618 --> 13:06.385
in the whole country.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.827
<i>The turnout is overwhelming</i>
<i>here at Andrews Air Force Base</i>

13:14.862 --> 13:18.898
where Sergeant Nicholas Brody
is scheduled to land

13:18.932 --> 13:20.166
in just under two hours.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.634
Now a White House spokesman
confirms

13:21.668 --> 13:23.903
that the Vice President
will be on hand.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.772
Do you even remember him?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.841
Not really.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.444
As we reported, Sergeant Brody
is one of two Marines

13:31.478 --> 13:33.379
who went missing in action
eight years ago,

13:33.413 --> 13:37.283
during a mission into
Iraq, near the Syrian border.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.119
A former Marine Scout sniper,
Sergeant Brody was operating

13:40.153 --> 13:42.755
in hostile territory
when his spotter...

13:42.789 --> 13:44.557
Hi, Brody.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.559
The soldiers
were then separated...

13:48.328 --> 13:49.795
You coming or not, Mom?

13:51.665 --> 13:54.066
'Cause I don't think it'd
appropriate if we were late.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.802
Yeah, let me
just get my coat.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.738
Are you really wearing
that dress?

13:58.772 --> 14:00.172
...but after the announcement

14:00.207 --> 14:02.842
that Sergeant Brody,
in fact, survived

14:02.876 --> 14:06.812
the eight-year ordeal and was
greeted by a wave of enthusiasm

14:06.847 --> 14:11.150
from an American public
eager to greet a true hero.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.818
More details on
Sergeant Brody's captivity

14:12.853 --> 14:14.453
are expected to come out

14:14.488 --> 14:17.990
over the coming days,
but a military spokesman...

14:22.195 --> 14:24.463
You look pretty, Mom.

14:24.498 --> 14:26.766
Thank you.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.275
Let's go.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.965
Start in the living room.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.105
I got 30 minutes.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.741
And good to see
you, too, Carrie.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.447
Who the fuck is he?!

15:14.481 --> 15:16.315
Relax, it's all good.
It's my brother Max.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.950
Max, say hi to the client.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.285
Hi.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.686
What happened
to Nick and Eddie?

15:20.721 --> 15:22.021
Out of your price range.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.689
I told you, for a grand a day,

15:23.724 --> 15:25.224
it's gonna be
bare bones.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.625
Hey, you got
a bad feeling about this?

15:26.660 --> 15:28.661
You want to roll this thing up

15:28.695 --> 15:30.763
before we get started,
you just say the word.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.167
Eyes and ears in every room.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.737
Then it's back to my place
to set up the monitors.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.248
No way you could delay
the ceremony?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.184
Not without looking
like a complete asshole.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.520
He's in the head now
puking his guts out.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.489
I thought the Army docs
did a complete psych eval.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.324
They did.
So what's the problem?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.793
I don't know, David.
Maybe eight years at the bottom

16:00.827 --> 16:02.361
of a hole had something
to do with it.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.530
I have the Vice President
arriving as we speak.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.632
And I need him smiling and
waving like a hero,

16:06.666 --> 16:09.001
like it's the fucking
Macy's Day Parade.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.791
The President asked me
to thank you personally.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.593
I have to think the short list
for the directorship

16:34.628 --> 16:36.095
just got a lot shorter.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.396
Well, I appreciate
the consideration, sir.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.898
Not that
I'm pushing for it.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.766
Sure you are.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.736
Hi, Dad.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.676
Dana.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.680
How was your trip?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.252
Look at how beautiful you are.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.631
Chris.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.967
Pleased to meet you.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.172
Hug him, Chris.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.589
Where's Mom?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.962
When?

18:49.996 --> 18:52.464
Four years ago.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.304
Sergeant Brody,
the Vice President's here.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.947
Sergeant Brody.

19:10.850 --> 19:11.951
It's an honor.

19:14.888 --> 19:16.689
Thank you, sir.

19:38.078 --> 19:40.279
You okay?
Yeah.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.227
Good morning, Marines.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.629
Good morning, sir!

19:56.663 --> 19:58.364
I said, "Good morning, Marines."

19:58.398 --> 19:59.965
Good morning, sir!

20:00.000 --> 20:01.734
Stand at ease.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.370
<i>Sergeant Brody, on behalf</i>
<i>of the President</i>

20:04.404 --> 20:06.538
of the United States and
a grateful nation,

20:06.573 --> 20:09.108
it is my privilege to welcome
you home!

20:09.142 --> 20:10.776
Oorah!

20:10.810 --> 20:12.411
Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.221
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

20:22.255 --> 20:25.491
I'm not really too good
at making speeches.

20:25.525 --> 20:28.827
My wife does most of the talking
in the family.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.633
Even though
I can't mention 'em by name,

20:34.668 --> 20:39.772
I want to thank the Special
Forces team that saved my life.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.909
And thanks
to all of you out there

20:43.943 --> 20:45.911
for your prayers
and your good wishes.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.112
It made all the difference.

20:47.147 --> 20:48.180
Most of all,

20:48.214 --> 20:50.849
I want to say...

20:50.884 --> 20:54.520
I want to say
thank you to my family

20:54.554 --> 20:58.057
for their strength
in my absence...

21:01.461 --> 21:06.098
...and for their undying faith
this day would come.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.167
I'm a lucky man.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.708
Guy's got game.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.815
How long before you're set up?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.516
The feed will be live
by the time

21:24.551 --> 21:26.185
Sergeant Brody
gets back to his house.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.155
More details on
Sergeant Brody's captivity

21:30.190 --> 21:31.523
are expected to come out.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.992
So, uh, you and Carrie,

21:34.027 --> 21:36.295
how long you guys
known each other?

21:36.329 --> 21:37.763
Long enough.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.865
'Cause I'd kind of feel
a lot better

21:39.899 --> 21:41.266
if I had a clear picture

21:41.301 --> 21:42.534
about who
we're dealing with.

21:42.569 --> 21:45.471
We are breaking, like,
12 federal laws.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.307
You would, would you?
A clearer picture?

21:48.341 --> 21:49.842
Why don't you shut
the fuck up

21:49.876 --> 21:51.243
and get back
to work, okay?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.947
Hey...

21:54.981 --> 21:57.816
I'm sorry, um... let's just say

21:57.851 --> 21:59.385
that she's
a little intense.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.753
Yeah.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.354
Yeah.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.593
What's that?

22:07.627 --> 22:09.428
It's what she hides
in her aspirin bottle

22:09.462 --> 22:10.696
instead of aspirin.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.333
I have one of my migraines
coming on, so...

22:14.367 --> 22:15.934
Let me see that.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.505
What do you
think it is?

22:22.542 --> 22:24.543
I don't know.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.088
I'm driving.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.056
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

22:38.091 --> 22:40.526
Jesus, Mom, just
let him drive.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.195
Okay, I guess.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.164
Marine!

22:45.198 --> 22:47.232
Mike?

22:50.970 --> 22:51.937
Welcome back.

22:51.971 --> 22:52.971
Thanks, man.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.542
How you holding up?

22:56.576 --> 22:57.543
You look good.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.278
It's great to be home.

22:59.312 --> 23:01.280
It's great to have you home.

23:01.314 --> 23:02.948
This is for real?
You stayed in?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.349
Military
intelligence.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.785
I know, right?
Me, of all people, huh?

23:07.821 --> 23:10.122
And Megan? How's she?

23:10.156 --> 23:11.723
Long gone, buddy.

23:11.758 --> 23:14.426
She divorced me between
my second and third tours.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.128
Ah.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.564
Look, I hate to bring this
up, but Langley wants to

23:18.598 --> 23:20.265
schedule a follow-up to
your debrief in Germany.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.934
- They asked me to arrange it.
- When?

23:21.968 --> 23:24.269
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?!

23:24.304 --> 23:26.605
I know. I said the
same thing, but...

23:26.639 --> 23:28.807
this guy Estes, he wants it
done sooner than later.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.443
He just got here.
It's okay, Jess.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.545
I'd rather just
get it over with.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.747
Well, I'll send
a car in the morning.

23:35.782 --> 23:36.882
Good.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.983
And when you're up for it...

23:39.786 --> 23:41.854
I'm taking you to the Greeks
for some steak and beer, buddy,

23:41.888 --> 23:44.289
'cause we got a lot of lost
time to start making up for.

23:44.324 --> 23:46.325
Huh?

23:46.359 --> 23:48.627
Yeah. God, it's good
to see you, buddy.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.830
You, too.
You, too.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.919
Look.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.287
We're famous.

24:24.264 --> 24:25.964
You said you'd be ready
by the time they got home.

24:25.999 --> 24:29.468
It's just a minor glitch,
give me a few minutes.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.776
You painted the house.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.044
Mike's brother did it.

24:41.281 --> 24:44.316
He's a contractor.
He gave us a really great rate.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.952
What do you think
of the color?

24:46.986 --> 24:48.654
I like it.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.455
Come on.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.624
I'll show you
what we did inside.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.346
How's it feel to be back?

25:14.380 --> 25:16.415
Can we get a group shot
with the yellow ribbon?

25:17.550 --> 25:19.084
What do you think?

25:19.118 --> 25:21.386
Sure.
Sure.

25:21.421 --> 25:22.454
Come on,
come on.

25:26.159 --> 25:29.394
Yeah. If you could just line up
in front of the tree, yeah.

25:29.429 --> 25:31.897
Family shot.
That's fantastic.

25:38.071 --> 25:40.339
Big smile.

25:40.373 --> 25:43.308
I'm having trouble collecting
that intel. I need you to get me

25:43.343 --> 25:45.310
into Sergeant Brody's debrief
tomorrow morning.

25:45.345 --> 25:47.713
And what good
would come of that?

25:47.747 --> 25:50.148
I'm a trained interrogator.
I'll ask him a few questions,

25:50.183 --> 25:51.583
poke around his story a little.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.819
David was very specific:
principals only.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.821
David's all about punishing me.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.156
And not just for what
happened in Baghdad.

25:58.191 --> 25:59.658
- Do you blame him?
- No, but...

25:59.692 --> 26:01.827
this shouldn't be personal;
I belong in that room.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.028
Will you behave yourself?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.264
Carrie?

26:06.299 --> 26:07.866
- Carrie?
- Sorry.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.201
Uh, yeah.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.469
I need you to promise.

26:10.503 --> 26:12.604
You will raise
no eyebrows in there.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.172
You will break no china.

26:16.209 --> 26:17.442
I promise.

26:17.477 --> 26:19.344
Good.

26:19.379 --> 26:21.613
Then you can have your face
time with Sergeant Brody.

26:21.648 --> 26:24.349
Thank you, Saul.

26:24.384 --> 26:26.284
Yep.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.220
Oh, Christ.

26:29.789 --> 26:33.091
Well?

26:33.126 --> 26:35.661
Hello, Big Brother.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.910
So when do you want
me back tomorrow?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.745
Carrie.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.847
I need to be in the office
by 9:00, so get here at 8:00.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.049
Okay.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.352
Hello?

27:35.421 --> 27:37.422
Hello?

27:37.457 --> 27:39.658
Hello?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.130
Who was that?

27:45.164 --> 27:46.598
Oh, Jesus,
you scared me.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.269
Nobody. They hung up.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.874
How was your shower?

27:59.378 --> 28:01.613
God, you look beautiful.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.753
How about a glass of wine?
I opened a bottle.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.421
Oh, I see what
this is now.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.023
Dimming the lights,
plying me with liquor.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.625
Is it that obvious?

28:13.659 --> 28:15.961
Kind of.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.431
I gotta say, I like you in
that nightgown, though.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.233
My mother wears a nightgown.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.336
This is a negligee.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.178
How about that wine,
what do you say?

28:36.282 --> 28:38.583
Sure.

28:47.460 --> 28:48.627
The tag is still...

29:19.926 --> 29:22.127
Is that okay?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.362
Yeah.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.256
Jess...

29:51.290 --> 29:54.192
Jess...
Hmm?

29:54.227 --> 29:56.595
Oh, my...

30:00.933 --> 30:03.401
Hey.

30:03.436 --> 30:04.903
What they did to you...

30:04.937 --> 30:08.173
Hey. Hey...

30:08.207 --> 30:10.609
Baby...
Oh, Jess...

30:12.445 --> 30:15.513
Oh, God...
Hey.

30:15.548 --> 30:16.548
I'm sorry.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.283
No, it's okay.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.351
I'm so sorry.

30:19.385 --> 30:22.220
Let's sit down here.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.091
It's over.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.726
It's over now, baby.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.261
I'm home.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.997
Okay.
I'm home now, baby.

30:32.031 --> 30:35.634
Okay. Oh, baby.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.558
Oh, God...

31:18.377 --> 31:20.045
It hurts...

32:13.733 --> 32:16.267
What
time is it?

32:16.302 --> 32:17.836
Quarter after 8:00.

32:17.870 --> 32:18.937
The debrief!
I'm late!

32:18.971 --> 32:20.305
- Shit!
- Want a donut?

32:20.339 --> 32:22.941
Two calls came in;
both hang-ups.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.776
Yeah? 
One last night, one this morning.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.811
Both times the wife answered;
both times there was no one

32:26.846 --> 32:28.713
on the other end of the line.
Did a number pop up on a tracer?

32:28.748 --> 32:32.050
No, and the calls were blocked.
Is there any way that...

32:32.084 --> 32:33.385
No, not without a subpoena.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.120
Look, Virgil,
if somebody's trying

32:35.154 --> 32:36.821
to make contact with Brody,
it'll only happen once.

32:36.856 --> 32:38.323
And when it does,
we'll be there.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.058
All right?
It's all good. Relax.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.027
All right.
I've got to get dressed.

32:50.503 --> 32:52.470
<i>Many of the men and women</i>
<i>in this room are involved</i>

32:52.505 --> 32:55.073
in the operation which resulted
in your rescue, so we take

32:55.107 --> 32:56.941
an extra measure of pride
in welcoming you.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.309
Thank you, sir.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.611
Now, we've all
read your debrief

32:59.645 --> 33:01.012
from Germany, so
today we just have

33:01.047 --> 33:03.248
a few more questions--
clarifications, really--

33:03.282 --> 33:05.617
that might help us in our
ongoing fight against Al Qaeda.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.486
- I understand.
- Good.

33:08.521 --> 33:11.222
Good. We'll, uh, start
with Stuart Strickland,

33:11.257 --> 33:13.425
lead analyst in
our Iraq section.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.193
Sergeant Brody,
it's a pleasure.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.495
A few weeks after your capture,
Special Forces conducted

33:17.530 --> 33:19.164
a direct action mission
against

33:19.198 --> 33:20.665
a former police HQ in Garma...

33:20.699 --> 33:21.833
According to your debrief,

33:21.867 --> 33:23.601
most of your incarceration

33:23.636 --> 33:26.738
was spent at a secret military
facility outside Damascus.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.606
What landmarks

33:28.641 --> 33:31.409
or structural details can you
give us to help pinpoint...?

33:31.444 --> 33:32.911
Eight months you were
smuggled overland

33:32.945 --> 33:34.946
to an enemy operating base in
Afghanistan.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.182
Now, after so many years,
what prompted...?

33:37.216 --> 33:38.850
Sergeant Brody, my name
is Carrie Mathison.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.785
I served as a case officer
in Iraq.

33:40.820 --> 33:42.887
Your picture was on
our MIA wall.

33:42.922 --> 33:45.690
I saw it every day
for five years.

33:45.724 --> 33:46.958
It's good to meet you in person.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.726
Thank you, ma'am.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.395
I'm sorry we were unable
to find you sooner.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.930
I appreciate that.
I'd like to start

33:51.964 --> 33:53.565
with the first few days
of your captivity

33:53.599 --> 33:55.467
if you don't mind.
Not at all.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.803
How soon after you were taken
did the interrogations begin?

33:58.838 --> 34:00.138
Pretty much right away.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.040
What did they want
to know?

34:02.074 --> 34:05.143
Anything I could tell 'em
about U.S. ground operations,

34:05.177 --> 34:09.313
supply routes, communication
codes, rules of engagement.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.049
When you were debriefed
in Germany,

34:11.083 --> 34:13.751
you said you gave up
no such information.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.020
My SERE training
was excellent.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.589
And Corporal Walker?

34:17.623 --> 34:19.389
Ma'am?

34:19.425 --> 34:21.159
Did he give anything up?

34:21.193 --> 34:25.063
We were never interrogated
together, so I don't know.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.732
But still you must have
wondered, especially

34:27.766 --> 34:29.134
after you learned of his death.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.368
I'm assuming

34:30.402 --> 34:32.137
there's a point
to all this, Carrie?

34:32.170 --> 34:35.139
There is, sir.
As you know, the first 72 hours

34:35.174 --> 34:36.440
after a soldier's capture
are critical.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.842
What he knows can be
used by the enemy

34:38.878 --> 34:40.612
during that period to
devastating effect.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.014
The point is Sergeant Brody
stopped being a source

34:43.047 --> 34:45.116
of actionable intelligence
fairly quickly,

34:45.150 --> 34:48.386
and yet he was kept
alive for eight more years.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.588
I'd like to ask him
if he knows why.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.592
I often wondered that myself.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.797
Who was your interrogator?

34:59.832 --> 35:00.932
An Al Qaeda commander.

35:00.966 --> 35:03.368
His name was Zayadi.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.470
Zayadi?

35:05.504 --> 35:07.872
That's what he told me
his name was, anyway.

35:07.907 --> 35:10.808
Was this him?

35:17.516 --> 35:18.850
No.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.818
But you know who this man is.

35:20.853 --> 35:22.220
Of course.

35:22.254 --> 35:23.855
Every Marine in country
was briefed

35:23.889 --> 35:25.690
on high-value targets.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.625
Did you ever meet him?
Abu Nazir?

35:27.660 --> 35:29.727
Was he ever present during
any of your interrogations?

35:29.762 --> 35:30.862
No.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.834
Look again.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.398
<i>Sergeant Brody?</i>

36:11.036 --> 36:12.804
No, I never met him.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.909
What-what... what about Walker?

36:17.943 --> 36:19.444
Did he ever mention Abu Nazir?

36:19.478 --> 36:20.545
No.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.081
You sure?
Carrie, how many times

36:23.115 --> 36:25.283
does the man have
to answer the question?

36:25.317 --> 36:28.353
It's just, I'm just
a little surprised, sir.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.355
Abu Nazir was in charge
of coordinating attacks

36:30.389 --> 36:31.623
against coalition forces
at the time.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.358
No one had more

36:33.392 --> 36:35.460
reason to sit down with the only
two American P.O.W.'s

36:35.494 --> 36:36.794
in his custody.

36:36.829 --> 36:40.064
Well, apparently, he didn't.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.636
Is there anything
else, Carrie?

36:44.670 --> 36:47.605
No, sir, that's it.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.740
Thank you,
Sergeant Brody.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.941
Thank you.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.309
Moving on,
Sergeant Brody,

36:51.343 --> 36:53.044
I'd like to turn
your attention

36:53.078 --> 36:54.746
to anything you may have
witnessed

36:54.780 --> 36:55.913
or overheard
when in captivity.

36:55.948 --> 36:57.982
Remember Mrs. Base?

36:58.017 --> 37:00.518
The math teacher?
Yeah.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.587
Yeah, she was, like, my
least-favorite teacher of all time.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.022
She's so annoying.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.923
Hey, can you guys
come in here a second?

37:05.958 --> 37:07.759
Hey, I need help
getting ready for tonight.

37:07.793 --> 37:08.893
What's tonight?

37:08.927 --> 37:10.528
Some of your father's buddies

37:10.562 --> 37:12.463
from Bravo Company are coming
over for a barbecue.

37:12.498 --> 37:14.766
There's a bag of corn
that needs to be shucked,

37:14.800 --> 37:16.267
and the grill needs
to be cleaned.

37:16.302 --> 37:19.103
I'll do the corn.

37:19.138 --> 37:21.005
So, do I have to be here?

37:21.040 --> 37:24.175
Why is everything always
a problem with you?

37:24.209 --> 37:26.177
I was just asking a question.

37:26.211 --> 37:28.613
I know things haven't
been easy between you and me.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.248
But we all have to find a way

37:30.282 --> 37:31.849
to be there
for each other now, okay?

37:31.884 --> 37:34.585
Yeah, okay.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.987
Clean the grill.

37:39.158 --> 37:40.525
Hello?

37:40.559 --> 37:41.926
Hey, Jess.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.294
Hey. How did it go?

37:43.329 --> 37:45.330
I'm actually still here
at Langley.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.864
I'm stuck in this debrief,

37:46.899 --> 37:48.266
and it's taking a little
longer than I expected.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.667
How much longer?

37:49.702 --> 37:52.070
Oh, only an hour or two maybe.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.739
Well, don't forget,
everybody's coming at 5:00.

37:54.773 --> 37:55.907
Sure. I won't be late.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.476
Okay. Bye, honey.

38:02.715 --> 38:05.383
Sergeant Brody
you're a man who's endured

38:05.417 --> 38:07.218
a terrible ordeal.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.686
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.256
Anything?

38:12.291 --> 38:15.026
As a matter of fact, yeah.
Brody just lied to his wife.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.294
- Tell me.
- Max is tailing his town car.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.196
Brody just said
he was still at Langley,

38:18.230 --> 38:20.198
but he told his driver to
drop him off at Bluemont Park.

38:20.232 --> 38:22.533
This is it.
He's making contact.

38:22.568 --> 38:23.935
All right, I'll meet you there.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.770
Where's-Where's Bluemont Park?

38:28.674 --> 38:30.641
Saul?

38:30.676 --> 38:33.211
Hey. Late for a
meeting off campus.

38:33.245 --> 38:36.547
How many boards
can one man sit on?

38:36.582 --> 38:39.784
You kissed Carrie Mathison
into my debrief this morning.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.420
I'm curious if that was
her request or yours.

38:42.454 --> 38:46.324
Hers. Frankly, I'm surprised
you didn't assign her yourself,

38:46.358 --> 38:49.093
since she's the only one in the
section who's ever been to Iraq.

38:49.128 --> 38:50.928
It's not her resume
I have a problem with.

38:50.963 --> 38:52.397
It's her temperament.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.132
What happened?

38:54.166 --> 38:57.201
She turned a routine follow-up
into a cross-examination.

38:57.236 --> 39:00.705
Kept trying to connect
Brody to Abu Nazir.

39:00.739 --> 39:01.739
It's always Nazir with her.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.374
I won't deny

39:03.409 --> 39:05.276
she can be a little obsessive
on the subject.

39:05.310 --> 39:07.845
Is there something
I should know, Saul?

39:07.880 --> 39:09.747
Not that I'm aware of.
Because the last time

39:09.782 --> 39:11.449
I heard her like this,
she bribed her way

39:11.483 --> 39:13.918
into an Iraqi prison,
caused an international crisis.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.486
I appreciate your concern.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.755
Carrie has learned her lesson.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.657
And we both know
how good she is.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.325
What did I tell you
when I agreed

39:21.360 --> 39:22.927
to give her one more chance?

39:22.961 --> 39:26.531
You said only if I agreed
to do the babysitting.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.199
I said it would end badly.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.667
For both of you.

39:32.504 --> 39:35.506
You've got a big blind spot
where she's concerned.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.542
Trust me.
I did, too.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.243
Now my wife lives in Palm Beach,

39:39.278 --> 39:41.446
and I only see my kids
twice a year.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.855
Did you fix the audio?

40:23.889 --> 40:25.223
Well, we'll know
soon enough.

40:25.257 --> 40:26.691
I set up a directional mic

40:26.725 --> 40:29.494
near the band shell.
Max, switch

40:29.528 --> 40:30.628
to channel three.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.129
Somebody's approaching Brody

40:32.164 --> 40:34.632
from 1:00--
a female, dark red coat.

40:47.412 --> 40:49.313
I didn't think
you'd be able to make it.

40:49.348 --> 40:51.983
I don't understand why
you had to go through Mike.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.851
Why didn't you just
call me yourself?

40:53.886 --> 40:56.287
I did. Twice.

40:56.321 --> 40:57.488
Are you recording this?

40:57.523 --> 40:59.123
But your wife answered.

40:59.157 --> 41:00.858
She didn't give me
any messages.

41:00.893 --> 41:02.360
Because I hung up.

41:02.394 --> 41:04.328
She hates me, Brody.

41:04.363 --> 41:05.763
Hates you? Why?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.932
Because I got remarried.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.034
Jessica reacted like
it was a personal insult.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.503
Like I was publicly
giving up hope that you

41:12.538 --> 41:13.771
and Tom were still alive.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.007
What the...?
Who the hell is she?

41:16.041 --> 41:18.709
Helen Walker. It's the wife
of the other missing Marine.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.912
Ah, well, then,
she's not Brody's contact.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.714
Just keep listening.

41:25.417 --> 41:27.385
The Pentagon said
you both were dead.

41:27.419 --> 41:29.453
And now they're refusing
to give me any information

41:29.488 --> 41:30.922
about what
happened to Tom.

41:30.956 --> 41:33.424
What do you want to know?

41:33.458 --> 41:35.359
How he died.

41:35.394 --> 41:36.894
He's gone.

41:36.929 --> 41:39.130
Does it really matter
how it happened?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.899
It does to me.

41:44.636 --> 41:47.238
He was beaten to death.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.476
Were you there?

42:02.020 --> 42:04.889
No.

42:06.024 --> 42:09.193
Thank you for telling me.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.297
I'm going home.

42:13.332 --> 42:14.799
Want to be there
in time for this barbecue.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.067
Hold on a second.

42:16.101 --> 42:19.136
Max, will you give us a minute?

42:20.706 --> 42:23.107
Max, step out of the van.

42:30.515 --> 42:32.483
I didn't think that this was
any of my business.

42:32.517 --> 42:34.118
Now I'm thinking that it is.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.321
Clozapine?

42:40.726 --> 42:42.460
I'm sorry.

42:42.494 --> 42:44.862
Was I supposed to say something?

42:44.896 --> 42:46.497
Just tell me I'm not out here

42:46.531 --> 42:48.099
risking federal prison
on behalf of a crazy person.

42:48.133 --> 42:50.468
I am crazy.
It's not funny.

42:50.502 --> 42:53.070
If anybody at the Agency
finds out about this...

42:54.539 --> 42:56.140
I've got a mood disorder, okay?

42:56.174 --> 42:57.575
I looked it up, Carrie.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.310
Clozapine's an anti-psychotic.

42:59.344 --> 43:00.978
I'm dealing with it.

43:01.013 --> 43:03.280
I've-I've been dealing with it
since I was 22.

43:03.315 --> 43:05.816
- Does Saul know?
- God, no.

43:08.453 --> 43:10.888
No. Nobody does.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.690
Don't act so shocked.

43:12.724 --> 43:16.060
I mean, it can't come
as a complete surprise.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.130
You know I love you, Carrie,
but I got to be honest.

43:19.164 --> 43:21.232
None of this is making me feel
any better.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.800
What are you saying?

43:22.834 --> 43:26.537
That I'm making
this shit up?

43:26.571 --> 43:29.040
Well, maybe I am; you know,
maybe it is all in my head,

43:29.074 --> 43:31.242
but you're in it now, Virgil,
up to your fucking neck,

43:31.276 --> 43:32.810
and so is your weird
little brother,
