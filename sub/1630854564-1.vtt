it's just so darling,

00:57.616 --> 01:01.376
And people are going crazy
over this magical christmas town

01:01.395 --> 01:04.063
In the heart
of majestic washington state.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.974
Over 30,000 people each year
flock there

01:08.127 --> 01:09.976
Right around the holidays,
can you believe that?

01:10.129 --> 01:12.462
-That's a lot of people.
-I certainly can, tatum.

01:12.481 --> 01:15.223
Because I'm actually
from leavenworth.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.150
-Stop it. You are not.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.319
I am. Grew up on lake wenatchee.

01:27.146 --> 01:30.589
[chuckles]
wait. Really? Are you serious?

01:30.740 --> 01:32.983
Yup, I just got the call
an hour ago.

01:33.001 --> 01:36.002
Okay, but I'm confused as to why
they would want me to cover it

01:36.097 --> 01:39.840
Instead of the all-american
morning dream team there.

01:39.992 --> 01:44.010
Because america doesn't
only look like tatum and drake.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.847
America looks like me

01:46.941 --> 01:49.349
And you, bridget torres.

01:49.501 --> 01:52.444
Not to mention, your funny
forecasts are the only reason

01:52.671 --> 01:54.113
We have people
tuning into the nightly news.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.948
Girl, I got to keep it
a little funny

01:56.175 --> 01:57.858
When I literally have
nothing to cover in la

01:58.010 --> 02:00.694
Besides a no-skirts
santa ana winds warning

02:00.846 --> 02:02.604
And the doom of June gloom.

02:04.683 --> 02:08.018
This is why people love you.

02:08.036 --> 02:11.188
Tatum isn't funny. She thinks
she is, but she isn't.

02:11.281 --> 02:14.967
And drake's humor is, mm,
debatable.

02:15.118 --> 02:19.029
The execs want your charm
front and center this year

02:19.047 --> 02:22.457
For our big annual snowcast.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.395
And it's going to air
on the morning show.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.391
This is the kind of exposure
you've been waiting forever for!

02:31.543 --> 02:35.212
Yes! I don't even care
about the stardom.

02:35.305 --> 02:37.805
My dream is just to move
to a morning spot

02:37.900 --> 02:39.733
Or a primetime.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.736
All right, so, uh,
who is all going with me, then?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.738
Well, there'll be a few of us.
You know, I've...

02:44.832 --> 02:46.481
Of course, I'm coming with you

02:46.575 --> 02:50.169
And eddie's gonna come and play
videographer for us.

02:50.396 --> 02:51.912
Oh, it'll be so fun.

02:52.006 --> 02:56.324
And they're not coming with us,
though, right?

02:56.418 --> 02:58.585
[bridget] lisa, 'cause you know
that would be a deal-breaker.

02:58.737 --> 03:01.847
Nope. No, no, no, no,
they're not going with us.

03:03.575 --> 03:05.926
Okay, great.

03:06.078 --> 03:09.021
Oh, then I guess I get to be
your and eddie's third wheel

03:09.172 --> 03:12.766
In this romantic bavarian
christmas town. Perfect.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.027
Honey, eddie and I have been
married for five years.

03:15.254 --> 03:17.437
We promise to keep the romance
to a minimum.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.532
All right, fine.

03:20.759 --> 03:23.202
All right, oh, my goodness!
So when do we leave?

03:23.353 --> 03:26.947
Tomorrow. We are going
to christmas town, usa.

03:27.099 --> 03:29.115
Ah! I can't believe it!

-Oh, hey, bridge.

03:40.796 --> 03:42.946
Oh, hey, uh, it's almost
kind of like that,

03:43.039 --> 03:44.297
But with an extra syllable
at the end.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.559
[laughs] oh. You're so funny.

03:47.786 --> 03:49.119
I wonder,
would you ever consider writing

03:49.212 --> 03:51.379
Some one-liners
for the morning show?

03:51.398 --> 03:53.881
Drake, wouldn't that be so cute?

03:53.976 --> 03:56.217
Uh, y-yeah, th-that would be...

03:56.311 --> 03:58.628
Wha-what are you doing here
so early?

03:58.647 --> 03:59.963
You're usually here
after we're gone.

04:00.056 --> 04:02.074
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I'm sorry

04:02.225 --> 04:04.225
I had to grace my face
around here this morning.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.152
But I actually
just had a meeting with lisa

04:06.247 --> 04:09.306
About the annual snowcast,
and I was asked to do the spot.

04:09.399 --> 04:11.975
So yay me!

04:11.994 --> 04:14.402
-Well, that's amazing! Congrats.
-Yes.

04:14.496 --> 04:16.813
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

04:16.832 --> 04:18.331
Uh, now, if you don't mind,
I have to go

04:18.425 --> 04:19.841
Bundle up for some snow.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.596
Did lisa talk to you about that?

04:24.823 --> 04:26.414
Hey, it's the first time
I'm hearing about it.

to come to mass with me.

Ready.

07:58.887 --> 08:02.147
Millie works at our year-round
christmas store downtown

08:02.298 --> 08:03.815
Almost every day,
she's done it ever since

08:03.967 --> 08:05.484
She retired from the bank.

08:05.711 --> 08:07.301
She doesn't have to do it,
she just loves it.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.136
[wally] and our son dillon here

08:09.156 --> 08:13.399
Is an expert at everything
in leavenworth.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.328
He, uh, used to work at the
visitors center every summer,

08:16.479 --> 08:20.056
So he knows any and every place
that you might wanna check out

08:20.149 --> 08:21.816
For your upcoming, well,

08:21.910 --> 08:23.560
-Snowcast.
-Yeah, snowcast.

08:23.578 --> 08:26.412
Speaking of, any news
on when all the snow flurries

08:26.565 --> 08:28.322
Might start pickin' up?

08:28.416 --> 08:31.901
[chuckles] right.
Well, I'll tell you.

08:31.995 --> 08:35.680
Santa sends snow
when you least expect it.

But rest assured,
we will get you your snowcast

08:57.704 --> 09:00.187
Mm, I've been waiting all year

09:00.207 --> 09:02.541
For some yummy hot apple cider,
thank you.

09:02.692 --> 09:04.450
Thank you.

-Cheers.
-Cheers.

09:07.272 --> 09:09.622
Mm!

09:09.775 --> 09:13.960
So what all is there to do
in this romantic little town?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.629
I assume you're taking me
to all the local haunts.

09:16.782 --> 09:19.206
Um, yeah, uh, I think we'll,

09:19.226 --> 09:21.542
You know, probably just wait
for everyone to get here

09:21.562 --> 09:23.728
And then we'll go see
all the best spots.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.882
Oh. Touring with the team, sure.
That'll be fun.

09:27.976 --> 09:29.401
But what about when we're done?

09:29.628 --> 09:31.218
We need to make some time
to, uh,

09:31.238 --> 09:33.572
Celebrate, just the two of us.

09:33.799 --> 09:36.816
Our viewership has
nearly doubled in the last year.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.152
Uh, I-it has, yes.

09:39.304 --> 09:41.821
You have, you have definitely
brought a lot of greatness

09:41.915 --> 09:45.250
To the show since susan has
left. That's, that's for sure.

09:45.477 --> 09:48.753
Um, and, yes,
that is a reason to celebrate.

09:48.905 --> 09:51.238
Wonderful,
so you'll pick a place,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.650
And make a nice little rezzie

09:53.668 --> 09:55.910
For a fun little
fireside dinner.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.912
-Make it a date.
-All right.

09:58.006 --> 10:01.174
I, I will, uh,
I'll find us a place.

10:01.326 --> 10:02.434
-[door chimes chiming]
-hey, hey!

10:02.585 --> 10:04.994
-Hi!
-There's the party people.

10:05.088 --> 10:07.664
Welcome to my hometown.
Merry christmas!

10:07.757 --> 10:10.166
Oh, thank you.
We are in love with this place.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.426
-Oh, good! Hey.
-[eddie] here's the man!

10:12.446 --> 10:13.853
Hey, buddy,
it's good to see you.

10:14.005 --> 10:15.864
-Dill!
-[mumbles]

10:18.452 --> 10:22.178
Bridget, this wintry weather
look suits you, sweetie.

10:22.271 --> 10:24.013
-I love the hat.
-Thank you.

10:24.032 --> 10:25.865
You are ready
for a snowstorm, huh?

10:25.959 --> 10:28.793
Yeah, um, the puerto rican
in me can survive

10:29.020 --> 10:31.855
A category-four hurricane,
but admittedly,

10:31.873 --> 10:35.541
A snowstorm is not this weather
woman's idea of a fun time.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.469
Well, I guess you won't be
buttoning up our jack frost

10:37.620 --> 10:39.286
When we build a snowman.
Will you?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.622
Guess not,
but I-I'll supervise

10:41.716 --> 10:43.791
From the warmth of the indoors.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.035
Okay.

10:46.129 --> 10:48.813
-You do that.
-Yeah, so...

10:48.965 --> 10:51.391
-Bridget, hi.
-Good to see you.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.800
-Hello.
-Thanks.

10:52.894 --> 10:55.561
Mm, uh,
those ciders smell so good.

10:55.714 --> 10:57.063
I think
I'm gonna go get us some to go.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.214
-Yeah.
-Okay.

10:58.233 --> 11:00.307
Do you guys wanna meet? Huh?

11:00.402 --> 11:01.660
[tatum] so nice to meet you.

11:01.887 --> 11:03.745
[indistinct chatter]

11:05.499 --> 11:08.315
Uh, four ciders to go, thanks.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.835
Hey, can we get to-go cups
for ours, please? Thank you.

11:10.987 --> 11:13.654
[sighs] so...

11:13.674 --> 11:17.083
You didn't know that
I was gonna be here, did you?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.326
-I did not.
-Well, I'm...

11:19.421 --> 11:22.422
I'm from here, and, uh,

11:22.516 --> 11:26.592
You know, I always
co-host the snowcast, so...

11:26.745 --> 11:28.261
[sighs] you know,
maybe we can just

11:28.355 --> 11:30.188
Find a way to somehow get along?

11:30.415 --> 11:33.433
Right, yeah, I mean,
I'm not sure why I'd assume

11:33.585 --> 11:34.934
This year would be
any different.

11:35.086 --> 11:38.922
But, uh,
lisa was a bit misleading.

11:39.015 --> 11:40.757
Right. Would you rather
I wasn't here?

11:40.775 --> 11:42.867
No, what I'd rather
is have tatum's job,

11:43.094 --> 11:45.094
And I'd rather
you and I be working together.

11:45.113 --> 11:47.021
You remember the job
that I didn't get

11:47.040 --> 11:49.708
Because you didn't think I was
the right fit for your show?

11:51.786 --> 11:55.213
[sighs]
bridget, look. Tr..

11:55.364 --> 11:57.882
I-it wasn't because
I didn't think

11:58.034 --> 11:59.533
That you weren't right
for the position.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.886
That's not what I said. Just--

12:02.113 --> 12:04.973
Just what?
Tatum was a better fit for it.

12:06.634 --> 12:11.545
Look, maybe we could get
a bite to eat

12:11.565 --> 12:14.807
Sometime this week,
and, you know, we can,

12:14.960 --> 12:17.961
We could talk about it.
It's, it's complicated.

12:17.979 --> 12:20.797
[scoffs]
the only explanation I needed,

12:20.815 --> 12:22.465
You just refused to give me.

12:22.558 --> 12:24.576
So thank you,
but, no, thank you.

12:27.639 --> 12:30.999
Ooh! She really
doesn't like you, does she?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.659
Nope.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.587
Well, that's a first.

12:35.738 --> 12:37.647
Too bad, bro.

12:37.665 --> 12:38.664
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

12:38.817 --> 12:41.242
Mm-hmm.

12:41.336 --> 12:43.002
-Stop it!
-Mm.

12:43.154 --> 12:46.155
-A real nutcracker museum?
-Mm-hmm.

12:46.249 --> 12:48.767
Do you believe that? Ah. Wait.

12:48.918 --> 12:51.418
Has it always been christmas
town, usa, here or what?

12:51.513 --> 12:52.678
Uh, actually, no, it hasn't.

12:52.831 --> 12:55.348
When it was established
as icicle flats

12:55.500 --> 12:58.092
In the late 19th century,
it was really just a small town

12:58.186 --> 13:00.261
Focused on logging and fur.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.113
-Ooh.
-And, uh, lake wenatchee.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.098
That sounds more
native american, no?

13:04.192 --> 13:06.025
Ah, exactly, yes.

13:06.177 --> 13:08.602
So before
the, the settlers came,

13:08.696 --> 13:13.032
The yakama, chinook and wenatchi
tribes were all over the area

13:13.184 --> 13:15.943
Hunting for elk
and fishing for salmon.

13:16.037 --> 13:18.187
So how did it become
little bavaria?

13:18.206 --> 13:20.857
W-well,
after the great depression,

13:20.875 --> 13:22.616
Uh, it started to die down a
little, and then they re-routed

13:22.710 --> 13:24.377
The railroads out of town

13:24.529 --> 13:26.787
And people started to leave
<i> en masse.</i>

13:26.881 --> 13:29.957
And then in the 1960s,
the town leaders got together

13:29.976 --> 13:33.553
And decided they needed to do
something to save the town.

13:33.705 --> 13:36.055
'cause the town already had
these stunning alpine hills.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.149
[drake] it's not unlike
those on the german countryside.

13:38.376 --> 13:40.543
They decided to change
the town's appearance

13:40.636 --> 13:43.212
By completely renovating
the town in hopes

13:43.231 --> 13:47.492
That it would draw in visitors
from all over, and it worked.

13:47.643 --> 13:50.403
[gasps]
ooh! A german bakery.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.146
Oh, the puff pastries
are calling my name.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.832
-Everything there is delicious.
-Oh!

13:53.983 --> 13:55.908
-Absolu-lutely.
-Coffee?

13:56.061 --> 13:59.078
-Oh. Of course.
-I'm hungry, too.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.897
-Bridget, are you coming?
-Oh, no, you go on.

14:00.915 --> 14:02.298
-I'll be right there.
-[lisa] okay.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.070
Do you see something you like?

14:07.163 --> 14:08.847
Uh, actually,
I was just thinking

14:08.998 --> 14:11.591
That might be the perfect spot
for the snowcast.

14:11.743 --> 14:12.851
Huh?

14:14.095 --> 14:16.337
Yeah. You're right.

14:16.431 --> 14:19.006
That's the, uh, the rhein haus.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.009
And we could probably get the
owner's number from my mother

14:22.103 --> 14:25.697
Who is working right there.

14:25.924 --> 14:28.515
Wait, is that
a year-round christmas store?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.443
Yes, it is,
that is kris kringle,

14:30.595 --> 14:33.621
And exactly why my mother was
dressed in her bavarian best.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.708
After you.

14:45.777 --> 14:49.203
This place is like
right out of a fairy tale.

14:49.222 --> 14:53.633
Welcome to your very merry
little bavarian christmas.

14:53.785 --> 14:56.185
Anything you want,
I'm sure we'd get a discount.

14:57.305 --> 14:59.546
Nah.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.808
-I know what you're doing.
-What am I doing?

15:02.903 --> 15:06.479
That annoyingly cute
drake's donations thing you do

15:06.573 --> 15:09.056
On your morning show
when you give away things

15:09.075 --> 15:11.317
To families in need.
I mean, it's...

15:11.411 --> 15:13.469
It's really nice
you do it on your show and all,

15:13.562 --> 15:15.413
But it's not gonna work on me,

15:15.640 --> 15:17.823
Mr. I love christmas,
I cannot be bought.

15:17.976 --> 15:20.585
Well, I didn't offer
to buy you anything.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.213
-Mm?
-Tsk.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.928
Merry christmas.

15:32.415 --> 15:35.341
Hi. And, mm...

15:35.435 --> 15:37.769
-For you...
-Ooh!

15:40.273 --> 15:42.999
[chuckles] oh! Aw!

15:43.017 --> 15:45.518
This ladybug is so precious!

15:45.612 --> 15:48.595
I love ladybugs.

15:48.690 --> 15:50.339
-How did you know?
-Ah!

15:50.358 --> 15:53.284
But this is not just a ladybug.

15:53.511 --> 15:55.954
In german
we call her a<i> marienkafer.</i>

15:56.105 --> 15:58.531
-And she brings great luck.
-Really?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.442
Well, that's good,
because I'm gonna need it.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.278
-Thank you.
-Hello, dear.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.464
-Hi, ma.
-Hey, where's everyone else?

16:06.615 --> 16:09.300
-Getting pastries next door.
-Oh.

16:09.452 --> 16:13.529
And so you just decided
to stop by and see your old mom?

16:13.622 --> 16:18.292
Well, of course, that and...

16:18.311 --> 16:21.813
We were hoping to get the number
for the owner of rhein haus.

16:21.964 --> 16:23.797
We wanna host
the snowcast there.

16:23.891 --> 16:26.651
Oh, hey, t-that's a great idea!

16:26.878 --> 16:28.561
Yeah, I-I'll-I'll text you
the info.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.154
They're really lovely people.

16:30.381 --> 16:33.065
So, bridget,

16:33.159 --> 16:36.643
Will you be staying
through christmas? I hope so.

16:36.738 --> 16:40.164
And you can see me perform at
the festhalle on christmas eve.

16:40.316 --> 16:42.649
Oh, I would love that,

16:42.744 --> 16:44.894
But I actually have to get back
to la by christmas eve

16:44.987 --> 16:47.488
Because I promised my aunt marta

16:47.507 --> 16:49.582
That I was gonna spend christmas
with her.

16:49.734 --> 16:52.510
-Well, that's very sweet.
-Hm.

16:52.661 --> 16:54.512
[instrumental music]

16:56.182 --> 16:57.740
[lisa] I hear
it's going to snow.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.666
-Oh, yay!
-[bridget] and also...

16:59.686 --> 17:02.186
I think it'd be good
if we got some footage

17:02.338 --> 17:04.430
Of those darling little stores
downtown.

17:04.582 --> 17:08.434
It would be great for a opening
montage before the spots.

17:08.586 --> 17:09.935
Yes, I think
that's a great idea.

17:10.088 --> 17:11.587
Wow, we're goin' a bit rouge

17:11.680 --> 17:13.865
With our format, though, huh?

17:14.016 --> 17:16.759
Well, I mean, isn't that the
point of filming on location?

17:16.778 --> 17:20.596
Just to have some fun with it
and keep things natural,

17:20.615 --> 17:24.691
Then get into the spirit of
the season and see what sticks?

17:24.786 --> 17:27.694
Yeah, I-I think that might work
with your evening forecast.

17:27.789 --> 17:29.605
And don't get me wrong,

17:29.624 --> 17:33.033
You do an amazing job
keeping it lively.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.795
I-I just don't know
for a big morning show

17:35.947 --> 17:37.538
With millions of viewers
who rely

17:37.557 --> 17:40.558
On a more formal
narrative format.

17:40.785 --> 17:42.376
I-I don't know.
I don't know if it works.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.728
You know, actually, I-I think

17:43.955 --> 17:46.289
You both make
really great points.

17:46.307 --> 17:49.959
So maybe it's a blend
of both sides of the spectrum

17:50.052 --> 17:52.461
Where we finally find
our sweet spot.

17:52.555 --> 17:55.147
-Yeah. I agree.
-Great.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.650
S-so we're in agreement, then.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.302
[tatum] uh, drake and I
should definitely work

17:59.395 --> 18:01.061
On a formatted script, though,

18:01.081 --> 18:04.323
Just to get us into the moments.

18:04.475 --> 18:07.476
Right, uh, but do I think
with bridget here,

18:07.570 --> 18:09.645
We can use some of those moments

18:09.664 --> 18:12.665
And sort of in there forefront.

18:12.817 --> 18:14.592
Yeah, I mean, I don't need
any charitable air time.

18:14.819 --> 18:16.552
Uh, trust me,
I'll find my own way in.

18:24.679 --> 18:27.254
Mm! Something smells good.

18:27.348 --> 18:30.608
Oh, yeah, I think my dad made
some traditional german meal.

18:30.835 --> 18:33.185
Uh, bratwurst,
sauerkraut and beets.

18:33.338 --> 18:35.671
Ooh, fun.

18:35.764 --> 18:38.950
Hey, uh, been meaning
to talk to you.

18:39.101 --> 18:41.786
Listen,
I know you're not thrilled

18:41.937 --> 18:43.529
About working on this thing
with me and tatum,

18:43.623 --> 18:48.292
But I do think we need
to find a way to get along,

18:48.519 --> 18:50.186
You know, at least
until this thing is over.

18:50.204 --> 18:53.297
Yeah, drake,
I do not have a problem

18:53.524 --> 18:55.299
With you two
working on the special.

18:55.526 --> 18:57.193
I mean, you guys
are the stars of the show.

18:57.211 --> 19:00.696
So I'm just gonna sit back
and do my little thing

19:00.715 --> 19:02.715
Like I always do.

19:02.867 --> 19:04.642
-Your little thing?
-Yes!

19:04.793 --> 19:08.646
Be the fabulous funny lady
everyone loves to hear deliver

19:08.873 --> 19:11.891
"all your up-to-date forecasts
at kqv!"

19:12.043 --> 19:13.651
And leave the big stuff
to you and tatum,

19:13.878 --> 19:15.878
Everyone's favorite
all-american hunk

19:15.971 --> 19:18.138
And darling dear
from<i> top of the morning.</i>

19:18.158 --> 19:20.383
No, no, that's not
what the network wants.

19:20.401 --> 19:22.735
You heard lisa,
we are all in this together,

19:22.829 --> 19:25.812
Which means the three of us
do this together.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.392
Drake, I don't know
what you want from me.

19:29.410 --> 19:31.169
Well, uh, for starters,

19:31.320 --> 19:35.581
We can at least pretend
to get along while we're on air.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.491
Nothing else,
for the sake of the viewers

19:37.510 --> 19:39.735
Who just want
a little christmas cheer.

19:39.754 --> 19:42.254
Okay, yeah, fine,
because the last thing I want

19:42.348 --> 19:46.833
Is to spend christmas
being a scrooge, anyway, so...

19:46.853 --> 19:50.855
Great. Yeah, nobody wants
to be that, right?

19:51.082 --> 19:54.750
So, all-american hunk, huh?
Says who?

19:54.769 --> 19:57.511
[laughs]
I-I wouldn't even know

19:57.605 --> 20:00.180
Because, you know, I'm actually
sleeping in the morning

20:00.200 --> 20:02.942
When you go on the air because
that is the price you pay

20:03.094 --> 20:07.947
When you go on air
hours after primetime, so, uh...

20:08.041 --> 20:09.765
Yeah, now, uh, if you will
excuse me, I would love

20:09.784 --> 20:12.210
To eat dinner before primetime,
uh, so...

20:13.880 --> 20:14.879
By all means.

20:16.624 --> 20:20.626
[drake] okay, oh, yeah.
[eddie] oops. Uh...

20:20.778 --> 20:23.295
-Here we are.
-Whoo!

20:23.448 --> 20:25.056
It's really comin' down
out here.

20:26.634 --> 20:28.968
-Ooh... Whoo!
-Well...

20:29.062 --> 20:30.803
-Beautiful!
-Whoa!

20:30.955 --> 20:32.897
Where are the trailers?

20:33.124 --> 20:35.716
-Trailers?
-The hair and makeup trailers.

20:35.810 --> 20:38.794
Tatum, did you read the email
I sent before we headed up here?

20:38.813 --> 20:40.145
We don't have trailers here,

20:40.298 --> 20:42.131
Neither do we have
hair and makeup.

20:42.224 --> 20:45.225
We said
every day make-up ready.

20:45.319 --> 20:47.820
What? Are you kidding me?

20:47.972 --> 20:49.989
We are a network brand.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.917
In what world would
I ever wanna do my own makeup?

20:53.068 --> 20:55.494
[gasps] oh, I don't know,
a world where you actually

20:55.646 --> 20:57.922
Read your own emails and know

20:58.073 --> 20:59.999
What you're getting
yourself into?

21:00.151 --> 21:01.817
Ah. I can't go on camera
like this!

21:01.836 --> 21:03.410
I barely put any make-up on.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.264
Tatum, you have flawless skin.

21:06.491 --> 21:09.934
You look the same
with or without makeup.

21:10.085 --> 21:14.013
Okay, do you wanna go back
to the lodge for a quick zhuzh?

21:14.165 --> 21:15.606
A zhuzh?

21:18.093 --> 21:20.611
Fine. Yes, please.

21:20.838 --> 21:23.005
-This was not in the script.
-I will--

21:23.024 --> 21:24.615
-Take me back.
-[whispers] take you back.

21:24.767 --> 21:25.950
Thank you.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.453
All right.

21:31.273 --> 21:32.957
-Who's ready to snowshoe?
-Whoo!

21:33.108 --> 21:34.458
[drake grunts]

21:34.685 --> 21:38.296
[bridget] how did you do yours
so fast?

21:38.523 --> 21:40.539
[drake] there's a bit
of a learning...

21:40.633 --> 21:42.616
[drake laughs]

21:42.635 --> 21:45.694
You, uh, you got 'em
on the wrong feet.

21:45.713 --> 21:46.804
[grunts] hold on.

21:46.955 --> 21:48.714
-What?
-Let me help you.

21:48.866 --> 21:51.458
How would you even know that?

21:51.477 --> 21:53.552
It, uh, it's,
it's the buckles. Okay.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.813
[drake] plop this around. Yup.
[bridget] okay.

21:55.964 --> 21:57.373
Okay, put your foot now.

21:57.391 --> 22:00.376
You know, I'm not helpless,
you know?

22:00.394 --> 22:03.637
I-I'm actually very good
at a lot of different things.

22:03.731 --> 22:05.881
Um, I know many forms of dance.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.901
I'm actually really good
at salsa and ballroom.

22:09.053 --> 22:12.479
-Uh, they're on point.
-Okay, I believe you.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.831
[drake] so you don't have
two left feet.

22:14.058 --> 22:17.001
You just get 'em flipped around
sometimes, huh?

22:18.396 --> 22:20.579
Yes.

22:20.731 --> 22:23.248
You're good to go.
Now key is the walking up.

22:23.401 --> 22:24.842
-You got it?
-[bridget chuckles]

22:24.993 --> 22:25.826
-Easy, just nice and...
-[screams]

22:25.845 --> 22:27.570
Oh, easy, easy.

22:27.588 --> 22:29.588
[mumbles]

22:29.682 --> 22:31.515
-Just nice and easy.
-Okay, I got it, I got it.

22:31.667 --> 22:34.018
-Oh! You're contagious!
-Ooh. See?

22:34.169 --> 22:36.169
-No!
-How're you supposed to help me?

22:36.189 --> 22:39.190
How are you supposed to help me?
Okay. Okay.

22:39.341 --> 22:41.025
Well, bridget,
I don't know about you,

22:41.176 --> 22:43.586
But I am ready
to get out on the snow,

22:43.604 --> 22:46.422
And hopefully
not take a real fall.

22:46.515 --> 22:49.925
Uh, yes, I actually hope you're
a lot more graceful on the snow

22:49.944 --> 22:54.096
Than you are here on this,
on this grass.

22:54.115 --> 22:57.875
And I think that is our cue
to get this tour going.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.769
Are we ready?

23:00.863 --> 23:02.938
<i> -Vamanos.</i>
-Wish us luck.

23:02.957 --> 23:05.716
This way. I'll stay behind you
just in case.

23:05.868 --> 23:08.886
-Oh. We're gonna take a while.
-[bridget laughs]

23:09.037 --> 23:10.721
All right, here we go.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.517
[laughing]

23:17.563 --> 23:19.212
Do I need to hold your hand
the entire time?

23:19.306 --> 23:21.565
[instrumental music]

23:24.462 --> 23:27.405
Mm, what's going on over here?

23:27.632 --> 23:32.301
[chuckles] hey, hey,
no peeking! It's a surprise.

23:32.319 --> 23:36.822
Well, it smells like
slow-cooked beef to me.

23:36.974 --> 23:39.417
-[chuckles]
-you got me.

23:39.644 --> 23:42.402
It's my bavarian
slow-cooked pot roast.

23:42.496 --> 23:47.091
But I bet you'll never guess
my secret sauce ingredient.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.428
Is it german beer?

23:52.080 --> 23:54.098
It is! H-how did you know?

23:54.249 --> 23:57.826
Oh, well, the bottle is actually
right over there behind you.

23:57.845 --> 24:00.104
-So I cheated.
-Uh...

24:00.331 --> 24:04.424
Wow.
Sneaky little elf on a shelf.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.943
Sorry.

24:06.170 --> 24:08.261
You know, actually,
if you like pork...

24:08.355 --> 24:10.764
-You have to try pernil.
-Pernil?

24:10.858 --> 24:13.951
Yeah, it's slow-roasted pork,
but puerto rican style.

24:14.102 --> 24:16.603
And we make it
with a lot of different spices.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.532
There's a nice layer of fat
left on the pork shoulder,

24:20.626 --> 24:24.462
And then we serve it with
yellow rice and pigeon peas.

24:24.613 --> 24:28.114
-Mm! Sounds heavenly.
-Oh, it is.

24:28.209 --> 24:30.542
You'll have to show me how
to make it. Get me the recipe.

24:30.695 --> 24:32.878
Yeah, uh, I'll get it
from my aunt marta.

24:33.030 --> 24:36.623
Wonderful! Maybe we can make it
together later this week.

24:36.642 --> 24:39.977
Look, I am always trying
to show up wally.

24:40.128 --> 24:41.770
To be honest,
he's a better cook.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.482
-Aw.
-Mm-hmm.

24:48.395 --> 24:49.487
[instrumental music]

24:58.981 --> 25:01.815
-Hey.
-Those are delicious, huh?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.743
Oh, yeah,
I always gain at least a pound

25:04.895 --> 25:06.653
Eating them
when I come home for christmas.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.840
Oh, yes, uh, rightfully so.
I would, too.

25:09.992 --> 25:13.660
So I was, um, just watching
our spot from this morning.

25:13.754 --> 25:17.573
It's...It's quite good.

25:17.666 --> 25:20.592
Yeah, I guess we owe eddie
some credit.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.245
-He knew what he was doing.
-Um, yes, he did.

25:23.264 --> 25:25.022
E-especially because
he caught that part

25:25.173 --> 25:28.600
With you
tripping over the snowshoe.

25:28.753 --> 25:30.269
Oh, geez!

25:30.421 --> 25:33.255
-So bad!
-Whoo! It was money!

25:33.274 --> 25:35.424
-Oh...
-Oh, it's cold.

25:35.517 --> 25:38.869
-Oh.
-You're not wrong. Whoo!

25:39.021 --> 25:40.204
Yeah, I got, uh...

25:41.523 --> 25:43.448
Somethin' for you right here.

25:43.601 --> 25:46.026
Just, um, you know, it's... Ah!

25:46.045 --> 25:48.437
[both laughing]

25:48.530 --> 25:50.881
-There it is.
-Very nice.

25:51.033 --> 25:52.550
-[sighs] thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:52.701 --> 25:54.552
You know what's gonna make this
even more perfect?

25:54.703 --> 25:57.221
-What's that?
-Some of these.

25:57.372 --> 25:59.723
Oh, please, I am...

25:59.875 --> 26:01.466
I've reached my limit.

26:01.619 --> 26:03.452
All right, I'll help you out,
thank you.

26:03.470 --> 26:04.636
-Yeah.
-Cheers.

26:04.789 --> 26:05.971
Dang it. I'll take the last one.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.357
Mm! I knew it.

26:10.961 --> 26:13.812
[instrumental music]

26:13.964 --> 26:16.298
[tatum] I mean, these antlers.

26:16.391 --> 26:18.725
These creatures are so majestic.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.804
And, wow, if they aren't just
totally domesticated.

26:21.897 --> 26:23.747
Drake, aren't you just in awe?

26:23.899 --> 26:26.917
They truly
are incredible creatures.

26:27.069 --> 26:29.828
You know, I grew up around
some of these deer.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.148
They can live up to 20 years
here on the farm.

26:33.167 --> 26:34.817
Wow! And-and...

26:34.835 --> 26:37.243
These younger ones, with
the-the smaller antlers...

26:37.263 --> 26:39.746
-How old are they?
-[drake] actually...

26:39.765 --> 26:42.324
Antlers don't dictate the age,
they shed their antlers

26:42.417 --> 26:44.676
Once a year and grow new ones.

26:44.829 --> 26:47.179
-Wow! Can you believe that?
-Crazy, huh?

26:47.273 --> 26:50.349
And let me tell you,
some of these antlers, sharp!

26:50.501 --> 26:52.926
Careful.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.187
Maybe that's how
rudolph got his red nose!

26:55.339 --> 26:56.688
Prancer nipped him one.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.616
[drake] well, believe it or not,
some reindeer

26:58.767 --> 27:01.619
Really do have a red nose.

27:01.846 --> 27:03.862
It's the result
of densely-packed blood vessels

27:04.014 --> 27:05.289
Just beneath the skin's surface.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.699
-No.
-Yup.

27:07.852 --> 27:09.609
So maybe rudolph isn't a rarity.

27:09.629 --> 27:10.628
Mm...

27:13.966 --> 27:17.784
Hey, everyone,
we predict santa's reindeer.

27:17.878 --> 27:19.136
Uh, it is raining reindeer

27:19.363 --> 27:21.972
Up here in leavenworth
quite literally.

27:22.124 --> 27:25.200
Now, um, can someone please get
this message to santa for me?

27:25.219 --> 27:28.294
If your eight tiny reindeer
ever get tired,

27:28.314 --> 27:30.314
These guys over here at the farm
are ready

27:30.541 --> 27:32.541
To rock out with you
on christmas eve!

27:32.559 --> 27:34.801
[cheering and applauding]

27:34.895 --> 27:36.136
[instrumental music]

27:36.230 --> 27:37.546
So nice to meet you.

27:37.564 --> 27:39.548
Who's next? Get on up here!

27:39.566 --> 27:41.717
[bridget] everybody say kqv!

27:41.810 --> 27:44.069
-Hi, I'm tatum.
-Reindeer!

27:44.163 --> 27:46.312
It's so nice meeting you guys.
Yup, take care.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.165
-Have a lovely day.
-Have a good day.

27:49.894 --> 27:52.728
-Well, that was a hit.
-It was good. Yes.

27:52.746 --> 27:55.989
You are
a bona fide reindeer whisperer.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.916
-They absolutely loved you.
-Uh, no.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.161
Uh, what they loved
was that magical reindeer food

28:01.180 --> 28:03.997
I coerced from the lady
who runs the farm.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.832
All the same, uh, you had them
eating out of your hand

28:05.851 --> 28:09.428
Like you were mrs. Claus
or something. I-I'm impressed.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.522
[sighs]
anyways, I mean...

28:11.673 --> 28:13.691
You really seem to have
the lady fans

28:13.842 --> 28:15.918
Eating out of your hand.

28:15.936 --> 28:19.530
Must be exhausting
being so special, hm?

28:19.681 --> 28:21.273
Nah, I wouldn't think
about that.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.608
A special guy

28:23.761 --> 28:26.537
Needs special girls. Tsk.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.044
Where did you learn how to cook
like this, bridget?

28:34.271 --> 28:36.271
Well, my aunt actually taught me
everything I know.

28:36.290 --> 28:40.384
She is such an amazing cook.

28:40.535 --> 28:43.554
And she got all her recipes
from my<i> abuelita</i> in puerto rico

28:43.781 --> 28:45.222
Because she has a restaurant
there, so...

28:45.449 --> 28:48.058
-Just kept it in the family.
-Very cool.

28:48.210 --> 28:50.394
-So, lisa, how were the ratings?
-Mm!

28:50.545 --> 28:53.789
The livestreams are a hit,
playbacks on the morning show

28:53.807 --> 28:56.400
Are up another ten percent,

28:56.627 --> 28:58.885
Which is normal
for the week of christmas,

28:58.904 --> 29:02.314
But pr says that it's more so
now than ever before.

29:02.466 --> 29:05.150
Wow, so I guess
being on location

29:05.302 --> 29:07.135
Is paying off then, huh, drake?

29:07.154 --> 29:08.895
Maybe we should do this
more often.

29:08.914 --> 29:12.140
Well, that and the fact
that we have a special co-host

29:12.159 --> 29:13.809
Keeping it spicy.

29:13.827 --> 29:17.921
Well, thank you, actually,
both, for having me.

29:18.073 --> 29:22.259
Um, and, of course, lisa and
eddie, for all of your hard work

29:22.486 --> 29:24.928
And the kincaids
for your hospitality.

29:25.155 --> 29:27.656
Just, it's been so lovely
being here.

29:27.749 --> 29:30.250
What a wonderful holiday trip.

29:30.344 --> 29:31.435
-I concur!
-Thank you.

29:31.586 --> 29:33.253
-And I'll cheers to that.
-Yeah!

29:33.272 --> 29:34.587
-Cheers!
<i> -Salut.</i>

29:34.607 --> 29:36.106
-Cheers.
-Guys.

29:40.504 --> 29:43.263
[exhales sharply]
ooh, good girl!

29:43.357 --> 29:45.265
Oof! Oof, it's cold!

29:45.284 --> 29:47.743
That was sweet of you to take
trixie out for your mom.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.680
Well, it's, uh...

29:51.773 --> 29:54.016
It's been my job
all through school

29:54.109 --> 29:56.701
Since my mom got her as a puppy.

29:56.854 --> 29:59.871
Dillon is not to be trusted
with the dog.

30:00.024 --> 30:03.133
Oh, okay. So, uh, you're saying
that you're the mama's boy?

30:03.285 --> 30:05.877
Oh, yeah, I still am.

30:06.030 --> 30:07.638
-Yeah, I believe it.
-Oh, really?

30:07.865 --> 30:09.698
I do, I do.

30:09.716 --> 30:11.791
So, um...

30:11.885 --> 30:14.294
What about your parents? I've
heard you talk about your aunt.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.889
But... Are they both
still back in puerto rico or...

30:18.042 --> 30:22.044
My mother was, and, um,
my dad grew up in the us,

30:22.137 --> 30:25.213
But we don't really talk much.

30:25.232 --> 30:27.473
They separated
when I was little, um...

30:27.568 --> 30:29.976
And he has a new family, but...

30:29.995 --> 30:32.645
You know, he sends money

30:32.665 --> 30:36.074
And birthday wishes
every single year.

30:36.226 --> 30:38.335
It does not fail, I just...

30:38.562 --> 30:40.653
It's probably
just what he can do.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.231
-That's great.
-And my mother...

30:43.250 --> 30:46.401
She passed a few years ago.
Uh, she was sick.

30:46.420 --> 30:49.254
Oh, man, I'm, I'm really sorry.

30:49.406 --> 30:51.664
Thanks.

30:51.758 --> 30:56.261
She got to see me on tv
just before she passed and...

30:56.413 --> 30:59.081
It was like a dream come true,
uh, for her.

30:59.174 --> 31:01.600
She really thought
I had made it.

31:01.752 --> 31:05.604
You have. I mean...

31:05.756 --> 31:08.273
Look, you're on
one of the best networks on tv,

31:08.425 --> 31:11.927
And really good at what you do.

31:12.020 --> 31:14.946
Yeah, I'm sure
she's watching somewhere,

31:15.099 --> 31:16.522
Extremely proud of you.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.208
Yeah, thanks.

31:20.028 --> 31:22.695
Growing up here
must've been like

31:22.789 --> 31:24.882
Living in a fairy tale.

31:26.868 --> 31:29.794
Yeah, sometimes.

31:29.947 --> 31:33.115
As you now know,
my mom can be a bit whimsical.

31:33.133 --> 31:34.892
So, uh,

31:35.119 --> 31:38.303
Holidays were always
off the charts.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.732
But, man, summertime,

31:41.959 --> 31:43.716
That, that's my favorite time
of year.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.477
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah.

31:45.629 --> 31:48.405
Hiking and-and hot springs,

31:48.556 --> 31:51.650
A little weekend trip
to spokane.

31:51.802 --> 31:55.579
Nothing beats the beauty
of it. Oh, I love it.

31:55.730 --> 31:59.416
Yeah, I bet. So, then,
why would you ever leave?

31:59.643 --> 32:02.994
Well, I, uh, went to college
in, uh, california,

32:03.147 --> 32:06.164
And... Decided to stay.

32:06.316 --> 32:09.000
You know, I guess
something called me to it.

32:09.153 --> 32:10.218
Mm-hmm.

32:13.248 --> 32:15.340
-How about you?
-Oh, I grew up in california.

32:15.492 --> 32:17.175
'cause that's where
my dad's from and...

32:17.269 --> 32:20.845
Um, then my aunt,
she got a job sponsorship in la,

32:20.940 --> 32:22.681
So then she came, too.

32:22.833 --> 32:26.777
And it's just always been
just the two of us.

32:26.928 --> 32:29.613
And, uh, boyfriends?

32:29.764 --> 32:32.190
-Got any of those?
-Oh, man, please.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.768
You know what I say,
dating in la feels like

32:35.788 --> 32:38.271
Going to a store
where nothing is available.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.940
So what is the point?

32:41.034 --> 32:43.368
Well, you know, maybe you, uh,
just haven't found the section

32:43.462 --> 32:46.021
That suits your style.

32:46.039 --> 32:48.540
Okay. So what's your excuse
for being single?

32:48.692 --> 32:49.967
Oh, man!

32:51.712 --> 32:55.530
I don't know, I guess I just...

32:55.549 --> 32:57.866
Haven't found the right fit.

32:57.884 --> 32:59.810
Isn't that what
alterations are for?

33:01.555 --> 33:03.480
-Wow!
-I had to.

33:03.631 --> 33:06.149
-My mind is blown.
-You're welcome.

33:06.301 --> 33:07.818
You are so welcome.

33:09.655 --> 33:13.898
Hey, uh, you want to go
into town tomorrow?

33:14.051 --> 33:16.885
We can stop by rhein haus,
check it out.

33:16.903 --> 33:18.662
Yeah, sure.

33:18.889 --> 33:20.646
And how about
I bring eddie's gopro,

33:20.741 --> 33:24.835
And I will put my amazing camera
operating skills to work?

33:24.986 --> 33:27.229
You're gonna be shocked.

33:27.247 --> 33:30.081
Well, I can't wait to see these
amazing camera operating skills.

33:30.234 --> 33:31.733
Good.

33:31.826 --> 33:33.493
All right, all right, so, uh,

33:33.512 --> 33:35.420
Sneak away seven-ish?

33:35.514 --> 33:37.973
Yeah, perfect.

33:41.928 --> 33:45.022
[instrumental music]

33:53.940 --> 33:56.682
All right, here we are.

33:56.702 --> 33:57.868
Okay.

34:00.113 --> 34:04.766
And this is the nutcracker
museum's mascot, karl.

34:04.859 --> 34:07.711
Leavenworth's most famous local.

34:07.938 --> 34:10.455
Wait, he's even more famous
than you?

34:10.607 --> 34:13.050
Oh, without a doubt.

34:13.201 --> 34:17.779
Karl was carved by karl rappl.
Took 18 months to make.

34:17.798 --> 34:19.614
Came all the way
from the real germany

34:19.633 --> 34:23.226
To join museum owners
george and arlene wagner's side.

34:28.716 --> 34:30.959
-[exhales sharply]
-mm.

34:31.052 --> 34:35.980
He's wonderful.
Everything in here is.

34:36.133 --> 34:38.316
Yeah, well,
you haven't seen the half of it.

34:38.468 --> 34:40.035
Wait till I show you upstairs.

34:42.897 --> 34:45.415
I can't believe it. I mean,
there's just so many of them.

34:45.567 --> 34:48.734
-All right.
-Uh, what, hundreds?

34:48.829 --> 34:51.237
Over 1400, to be exact.

34:51.331 --> 34:53.665
-Oh, wow.
-Mm-hmm.

34:53.817 --> 34:57.594
Uh, it's-it's magical.
I mean, really, it is.

34:57.821 --> 34:58.653
-Look here...
-How long has this...

34:58.672 --> 35:00.580
[laughing]

35:00.599 --> 35:02.824
How long has this been here for?

35:02.917 --> 35:05.435
-Over 25 years. Yeah.
-Mm.

35:05.587 --> 35:08.254
Used to be a-a private show,
and then they made it public

35:08.273 --> 35:10.774
And now
people from all over can see.

35:11.835 --> 35:13.777
Yeah.

35:13.928 --> 35:15.520
Oh, and it's not just
nutcrackers.

35:15.672 --> 35:18.022
-There's other stuff here, too.
-Yeah. Yeah.

35:18.117 --> 35:20.342
Not just the kind we know
from christmas plays.

35:20.360 --> 35:23.787
You know, there's these
european wooden figurals,

35:24.014 --> 35:27.124
The kind they used
in victorian tableware,

35:27.275 --> 35:29.701
All kinds made from ebony,

35:29.853 --> 35:32.129
Metal, boxwood, you name it.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.465
[clears throat]

35:40.364 --> 35:41.954
What?

35:42.048 --> 35:44.790
Oh, uh, nothin'. I just...

35:44.810 --> 35:47.793
Uh, isn't there a big story
you wanna tell

35:47.813 --> 35:49.295
With that camera in your hand?

35:49.314 --> 35:52.040
Oh. Yes, uh...

35:52.133 --> 35:53.708
We should probably do a piece,

35:53.727 --> 35:55.819
And, you know, give lisa
what she's looking for.

35:56.046 --> 35:59.881
But I just wanna enjoy it
for a moment, you know?

35:59.900 --> 36:01.549
-For myself, too.
-Yeah.

36:01.643 --> 36:03.493
I know exactly what you mean.

36:05.739 --> 36:07.497
-Hm.
-Show you somethin' else.

36:11.395 --> 36:14.171
[instrumental music]

36:18.585 --> 36:22.012
-[gasps] ooh!
-Huh?

36:22.163 --> 36:24.181
-Right?
-Wow, I...

36:24.332 --> 36:25.757
I'm not gonna know
what to choose.

36:25.909 --> 36:28.000
Uh, do they offer
a sample platter?

36:28.020 --> 36:31.262
Because I want to try
all the things.

36:31.356 --> 36:35.007
Well, I can honestly say I've
tried just about everything,

36:35.027 --> 36:38.753
And honestly, no matter
what you choose, can't go wrong.

36:38.772 --> 36:41.031
Mm. Okay, then.

36:41.182 --> 36:43.849
-Not that that helps.
-Not at all.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.369
-Hi. Uh, let's see.
-Hey, how are ya?

36:46.596 --> 36:48.930
All right then, sir,
I'm going to have

36:49.023 --> 36:50.707
A soft-iced gingerbread cookie

36:50.934 --> 36:53.376
With this pink
buttercream frosting.

36:53.528 --> 36:55.545
A marionberry scone.

36:55.772 --> 36:58.715
-[gasps] oh, a tiramisu cake.
-Yes.

36:58.942 --> 37:02.034
Oh, and, yum,
I-I have to do this.

37:02.128 --> 37:04.870
Gigantic cinnamon roll.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.615
Oh, and can I have
a double cappuccino

37:07.634 --> 37:10.060
Just so I do not go
into a food coma later?

37:11.396 --> 37:12.729
And what would you like?

37:15.141 --> 37:17.049
[bridget] I wanna come back
to get some pastries

37:17.069 --> 37:19.552
To take back to my aunt,
but I'm just afraid

37:19.571 --> 37:21.129
Of what I'm gonna eat.

37:21.147 --> 37:24.056
And I'm afraid
if I keep eating with you,

37:24.150 --> 37:26.409
I need to ask santa for some
bigger sweaters this christmas.

37:28.896 --> 37:31.823
So how long has this place been
around? Did you come as a kid?

37:31.975 --> 37:35.252
Yeah, I did,
this place opened up

37:35.403 --> 37:37.829
When I was about ten,
I wanna say.

37:37.923 --> 37:41.591
And, uh, dillon and I,
we used to save all our money.

37:41.818 --> 37:44.486
We'd, uh, buy mom and dad
these little cakes

37:44.579 --> 37:45.837
For their birthday from here.

37:45.989 --> 37:49.415
-Aww, that's so sweet.
-Yeah.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.102
And what about in high school?

37:52.253 --> 37:55.588
Is this also where you brought
the ladies on a first date?

37:55.682 --> 37:58.275
-Absolutely not.
-Okay.

37:58.426 --> 38:00.610
I had a job in high school,
I took 'em somewhere fancy,

38:00.762 --> 38:03.095
Like andreas keller.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.840
Oh, okay. And what was
this, this big job?

38:05.859 --> 38:08.952
I worked for the local
visitors center, actually.

38:09.103 --> 38:11.288
You know, showed tourists
all around town every weekend.

38:11.515 --> 38:15.350
That's how you know so much
of this history.

38:15.368 --> 38:18.277
Well, to be fair,
everyone around here

38:18.371 --> 38:20.021
Knows the town's history.

38:20.114 --> 38:21.781
It's part of the town's pride.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.134
-Oh.
-What about you?

38:24.285 --> 38:26.469
-Have a job in high school?
-Yeah.

38:26.621 --> 38:30.473
I was an english tutor for
young, spanish-speaking kiddos

38:30.625 --> 38:32.550
Coming from puerto rico.

38:32.702 --> 38:34.460
I still do it for some kids.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.372
It's just not something
I charge for.

38:37.465 --> 38:39.482
Oh, that's, that's really sweet.

38:46.140 --> 38:49.567
-That food was amazing!
-Told ya.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.387
I think we need to walk
the entire town again

38:52.405 --> 38:55.648
To burn off all the calories
I've had today.

38:55.667 --> 38:59.985
Or we can go say hi to my mom
right here.

39:00.005 --> 39:04.248
Take a walk in the kringle
after-hours.

39:04.401 --> 39:07.251
You wouldn't believe
how magical it is at night.

39:07.404 --> 39:09.179
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Come on.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.351
Well, here we are.

39:16.429 --> 39:21.265
Okay, town tour guide,
tell me more about this place.

39:21.418 --> 39:25.862
Well, uh, it first opened up
when I was a kid.

39:26.013 --> 39:29.032
-Back in '86.
-Oh, wow.

39:29.183 --> 39:32.443
Uh, so these places really
are your childhood, then, huh?

39:32.596 --> 39:35.263
Hm, 100%.

39:35.281 --> 39:38.766
And my mom started working
holidays here

39:38.785 --> 39:41.360
As long as I can remember.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.714
Started reading<i> 'twas</i>
<i> the night before christmas</i>

39:44.941 --> 39:46.457
Right here to all the kids
every afternoon.

39:46.610 --> 39:49.293
Aww... I wanna be
a part of that.

39:49.446 --> 39:51.279
So great.

39:51.372 --> 39:54.557
So how did
she and your dad meet?

39:54.709 --> 39:58.043
They are so cute together.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.564
Trust me. It wasn't as romantic
as you might think.

40:02.976 --> 40:04.642
-We met at the bank.
-Oh.

40:04.794 --> 40:06.385
He came in to do
a wire transfer,

40:06.479 --> 40:08.980
He asked me out on a date.

40:09.132 --> 40:12.224
I believe he was wiring
his college tuition.

40:12.318 --> 40:14.302
So what did you say?

40:14.320 --> 40:17.822
Well, I said, "if you're moving
soon to go away to college,

40:17.916 --> 40:19.582
Well, then, no.

40:19.734 --> 40:24.254
But if you come back some day
and I'm still here,

40:24.481 --> 40:26.405
Then, yeah,
I'll go out with you."

40:26.425 --> 40:30.093
-[laughing] okay.
-Yeah, it sounds like dad.

40:30.320 --> 40:34.172
So, you said
your aunt loves church.

40:34.324 --> 40:36.324
Oh, yeah, it's her thing.

40:36.342 --> 40:39.585
Well, I think I have
just the thing for her.

40:39.679 --> 40:42.564
[instrumental music]

40:49.948 --> 40:54.099
It's a snow-covered countryside
catholic christmas church.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.360
[gasps]
oh!

40:56.455 --> 40:58.680
It's perfect.

40:58.698 --> 41:00.623
-Thank you.
-Wonderful!

41:03.369 --> 41:05.703
Isn't it a little worrisome
they're still not back?

41:05.855 --> 41:07.855
-They went offline hours ago.
-[door shuts]

41:07.949 --> 41:09.632
[gasps] oh, hey. There they are.

41:09.784 --> 41:11.134
-Hello!
-Hey!

41:11.361 --> 41:13.878
<i> Hola!</i> Ooh.
What are we drinking?

41:13.972 --> 41:16.380
-Hot toddies. You want one?
-I would love one.

41:16.533 --> 41:18.866
-Yeah?
-I'll go make us a couple.

41:18.885 --> 41:20.459
No, I'll help you.
You don't make 'em good.

41:20.553 --> 41:22.294
-Uh-oh.
-[laughing]

41:22.314 --> 41:24.038
-Really? Oh, thanks.
-Really!

41:24.131 --> 41:26.149
So how'd the rest of the day go?

41:26.300 --> 41:28.710
It was nice.
Um, how are the clips?

41:28.728 --> 41:32.638
Oh, fantastic! And the ratings
are still growing.

41:32.732 --> 41:35.566
We had an online
frenzy of fans

41:35.660 --> 41:38.161
Watching your excursions
around town this afternoon,

41:38.388 --> 41:42.390
And over 90,000 viewers
today alone.

41:42.408 --> 41:44.650
-What?
-What?

41:44.669 --> 41:46.894
Which means
even more viewers tomorrow

41:46.988 --> 41:48.396
As the onliners create a buzz.

41:48.414 --> 41:49.839
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

41:49.991 --> 41:51.508
I can't wait
to watch the playback.

41:51.659 --> 41:53.251
-You haven't watched them yet?
-No.

41:53.345 --> 41:55.570
Wow! Well, I guess...

41:55.588 --> 41:57.329
Then you missed my, uh, clip

41:57.423 --> 42:00.241
Making pinecone wreaths
here on the property, too, huh?

42:00.334 --> 42:02.334
Yeah, I guess
that I missed that all,

42:02.354 --> 42:04.670
Sadly, but I'm gonna... I'll
have to watch it tonight though.

42:04.764 --> 42:08.674
So what is it exactly you two
were so busy doing this evening?

42:08.693 --> 42:11.343
We thought for sure
you'd be back for diner.

42:11.363 --> 42:14.013
-Wally saved you some schnitzel.
-Aww! That's sweet.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.199
Uh, we actually had dinner
downtown, though,

42:16.350 --> 42:19.927
In this great little german
restaurant in this basement.

42:19.946 --> 42:22.430
It was delicious!

42:22.448 --> 42:24.523
And I got to see
the christmas store at night.

42:24.617 --> 42:26.601
-So cute.
-Aww!

42:26.619 --> 42:28.527
It sounds like the two of you
had a lot fun.

42:28.621 --> 42:30.104
Well, that sounds cute,

42:30.197 --> 42:32.715
But I think having snow
for the snowcast

42:32.942 --> 42:36.778
Is a bit more of a pressing
issue for me anyway.

42:36.796 --> 42:38.721
Um, well, I am gonna go to bed.

42:38.873 --> 42:40.281
What? Already?

42:40.300 --> 42:42.374
Yeah, I'm pretty tired.

42:42.394 --> 42:45.562
Uh, making pinecone wreaths
without the help

42:45.713 --> 42:49.399
Of my co-host today proved to be
quite the daunting debacle.

42:49.626 --> 42:52.051
-Right. Well, I'm sorry.
-[tatum] it's okay.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.978
I'm sure you were great.
You always are.

42:54.130 --> 42:56.221
Thank you. Goodnight, everyone.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.891
-[lisa] goodnight.
-Goodnight.

42:58.985 --> 43:00.468
-For you.
-Thank you.

43:00.561 --> 43:03.246
-You're welcome.
-Mm! Smells good.

43:03.473 --> 43:06.641
So, uh, dillon said
the clips were a hit?

43:06.734 --> 43:09.419
Yup. I was just telling bridget.

43:09.646 --> 43:12.647
Guess the viewers
just love the two of you.

43:12.665 --> 43:15.258
The two of us? That's rich.

43:15.409 --> 43:18.595
Uh, they probably can't get
enough of christmas town, usa.

43:18.822 --> 43:22.156
What? Are you kidding?
We crushed it!

43:22.175 --> 43:26.585
Okay, then, uh, so cheers to us
and christmas in leavenworth.

43:26.605 --> 43:28.012
-[dillon] yeah.
-[overlapping chatter]

43:28.106 --> 43:30.681
[all] cheers.

43:30.834 --> 43:32.275
Eye contact. Eye contact.

43:35.113 --> 43:38.281
From the 155 douglas fir
and pine trees

43:38.432 --> 43:41.284
Used to create
this exquisite log cabin,

43:41.511 --> 43:43.678
To the giant
hand-picked river rocks

43:43.771 --> 43:46.180
Used to make
the walk-around fireplace,

43:46.199 --> 43:50.034
This destination winery has no
shortage of holiday merrymaking.

43:50.186 --> 43:52.520
That's right, tatum,
the icicle ridge winery

43:52.538 --> 43:55.948
Is a classic staple
of our humble holiday town.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.967
So who's ready
for the grand tour?

44:00.380 --> 44:04.140
That was great. Uh, now let's
get bridget on the grapevines.

44:04.291 --> 44:07.201
Drake, uh, why don't you come in
during bridget's, uh, spot?

44:07.294 --> 44:08.703
You could, uh,
bring in a bottle,

44:08.721 --> 44:10.554
Say it's time for wine-tasting.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.206
-I like it.
-Yeah.

44:12.225 --> 44:14.041
Hey, dill,
grab me a bottle of your best.

44:14.060 --> 44:17.136
-Yes, I think... You know...
-So just, I was...

44:17.155 --> 44:20.214
Um, hello.
What about me? What am I doing?

44:20.233 --> 44:22.400
Oh, tatum, uh, why don't you go
pick out some wines

44:22.494 --> 44:24.568
For the, uh, sip-and-paint?
And we'll be right there.

44:24.663 --> 44:26.404
Thanks.

44:26.556 --> 44:28.164
[lisa] um...

44:28.315 --> 44:31.409
And spanning over five acres
of productive grapevines

44:31.503 --> 44:34.337
Here in the foothills
of the cascade mountains,

44:34.564 --> 44:37.322
Icicle ridge
is no stranger to snow

44:37.342 --> 44:40.659
As they get over 90 inches
of snow per year.

44:40.679 --> 44:43.404
I mean, look at this,
it's magical.

44:43.423 --> 44:45.330
Well, I guess that's one thing
we can scratch

44:45.425 --> 44:46.683
From santa's wish list.

44:46.910 --> 44:48.500
You know what
I'm wishin' for here?

44:48.594 --> 44:49.577
What are you wishin' for?

44:49.670 --> 44:52.689
A flight inside from the freeze.

44:52.840 --> 44:55.858
-Flight of wine, that is.
-Oh-ho-ho.

44:56.010 --> 44:58.695
Guess drake kincaid
has jokes now.

44:58.846 --> 45:01.105
-I have my moments.
-[lisa] cut!

45:01.199 --> 45:03.424
Well, that was a tree-topper
on my christmas tree.

45:03.517 --> 45:05.017
-Let's drink!
-[bridget] yes, cheers!

45:05.036 --> 45:06.202
-Do it!
-Good job.

45:08.264 --> 45:09.280
[tatum] I don't know
what I'm gonna paint!

45:09.374 --> 45:11.949
And here you go.

45:12.101 --> 45:14.026
-Ooh. Such service.
-Yeah.

45:14.045 --> 45:17.029
I worked here in high school,
and law school summers.

45:17.048 --> 45:20.958
You got a bona fide holiday
sommelier at your service.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.036
Okay, so, uh,
which one should I try first?

45:24.055 --> 45:25.947
Just go in the order
of the numbers.

45:25.965 --> 45:28.224
Well, you can go in the order
of the numbers,

45:28.451 --> 45:32.395
But I actually prefer to go
by the tastiest.

45:32.546 --> 45:35.398
-And then I'll save--
-save the best one for last?

45:35.549 --> 45:37.066
My brother does
the exact same thing.

45:40.721 --> 45:43.573
[instrumental music]

45:53.159 --> 45:55.752
[chuckling]

45:55.979 --> 45:59.647
Okay, sipping time's up.
Brushes down.

45:59.665 --> 46:02.500
-Eeh!
-Let's see 'em!

46:02.594 --> 46:05.428
[lisa] your perfect holiday
on canvas with acrylics.

46:07.323 --> 46:10.057
Nay! Uh-uh-uh! No peeking.
You first.

46:10.769 --> 46:12.268
All right.

46:14.421 --> 46:16.439
My perfect holiday.

46:16.590 --> 46:19.500
What's in the stocking
from santa?

46:19.519 --> 46:21.778
Well, hopefully,
season tickets to the lakers.

46:21.929 --> 46:23.521
-Oh.
-[laughing]

46:23.673 --> 46:25.281
Okay, tatum, your turn.

46:27.677 --> 46:31.120
I am dreaming
of a white christmas.

46:31.272 --> 46:32.363
Very nice.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.682
And, bridget?

46:34.775 --> 46:38.795
So I went with a cozy little

-[lisa chuckles]
-spetch-z-leh.

46:56.797 --> 47:00.224
Mm! Well, it is delish,
even though I can't say that.

47:00.318 --> 47:03.468
So I will just eat it.

47:03.563 --> 47:07.548
This mushroom sauce is so good,
babe, I'm in heaven.

47:07.641 --> 47:08.899
We have to learn
how to make this at home.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.993
Mm, yeah, and, you know,

47:11.145 --> 47:15.331
If we replace the mushrooms
with, like, melted cheese,

47:15.558 --> 47:17.908
And you have the perfect dish
for kids. Hm.

47:18.061 --> 47:21.320
Oh, are you two thinkin'
about having kids?

47:21.339 --> 47:22.413
-Ed, you didn't tell me this.
-No.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.748
This is news to me, too, lisa.

47:24.901 --> 47:27.677
I mean, look,
it's not a must right now,

47:27.904 --> 47:31.072
But we think it might be
a good time to try.

47:31.090 --> 47:33.165
We're not getting younger,
and, you know,

47:33.184 --> 47:36.018
We both want a child, maybe two.

47:36.245 --> 47:38.020
And if the first one's like me,
we'll have two.

47:38.247 --> 47:40.523
-[drake] oh, geez.
-It's like her, one is enough.

47:40.750 --> 47:42.917
-My god! Better watch yourself.
-[bridget] wow.

47:42.935 --> 47:45.510
I'm teasing, babe, any child
of ours that's like you

47:45.605 --> 47:48.513
Will be the apple of my eye.

-And here's one for you.
-What is this?

48:54.581 --> 48:56.840
Our script for the snowcast,
of course.

48:56.993 --> 48:58.492
Don't worry,
I left a little bit of room

48:58.511 --> 49:00.919
For bridget's
stellar improvisational skills

49:00.939 --> 49:02.754
Just in case
we don't get any snow,

49:02.774 --> 49:05.274
So you can have a little fun.

49:05.426 --> 49:08.519
This has you and drake
doing the entire snowcast

49:08.613 --> 49:10.595
And then just me getting
covered in snow at the end.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.674
Oh, like I said, it's your spot.

49:13.767 --> 49:15.618
You have room to say
whatever you want.

49:17.288 --> 49:20.364
Those pastries look delicious.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.124
I need coffee.

49:22.276 --> 49:24.702
[tatum] anybody need anything
from the kitchen?

49:24.854 --> 49:27.037
-I'm good.
-Uh...

49:27.131 --> 49:30.758
Um, would you guys mind if I
talk to lisa alone for a moment?

49:32.545 --> 49:34.470
-Sure.
-Thanks.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.306
Yeah.

49:41.037 --> 49:43.295
Bridget, I am so sorry.

49:43.389 --> 49:46.131
I had no idea she was writing
a script for the snowcast.

49:46.225 --> 49:48.633
-I swear.
-Yeah, no. Clearly.

49:48.728 --> 49:53.214
But I thought that the network
wanted<i> me</i> to host the snowcast.

49:53.232 --> 49:55.716
I know, and I figured
they were just here for the week

49:55.735 --> 49:58.643
For the bells and whistles.

49:58.738 --> 50:01.414
But I mean, she's tatum tilson.

50:02.408 --> 50:04.391
What should I do?

50:04.485 --> 50:06.151
Call the network
and tattle and say

50:06.170 --> 50:08.395
That she wants to open
the special?

50:08.489 --> 50:11.323
-I will.
-Yeah, I know. I guess not.

50:11.417 --> 50:13.917
-Um...
-Look.

50:14.012 --> 50:16.587
Why don't you just work
on your own thing?

50:16.681 --> 50:20.424
They can film theirs and
we just do separate segments.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.977
But put yours first in the edit.

50:24.838 --> 50:26.647
-I will.
-I know you will.

50:28.100 --> 50:31.009
Nope. You know what? It's fine.

50:31.029 --> 50:33.678
We'll just do the livestream
like we originally planned

50:33.698 --> 50:36.348
And I'll just have
to show the world

50:36.367 --> 50:38.850

50:48.271 --> 50:50.437

50:50.456 --> 50:52.531
Is it wishful thinking
that these, uh, weather patterns

50:52.550 --> 50:54.625
Continue to shift?

50:54.777 --> 50:57.369
I mean, you never know.

50:57.388 --> 51:00.372
I really hope it keeps snowing
like this for tomorrow.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.633
Hey, you okay?

51:02.727 --> 51:05.286
Yeah, I'm fine. Never better.

51:05.379 --> 51:06.896
Well, what was that about
earlier

51:07.047 --> 51:09.732
With, uh, you know, the script
and lisa and all?

51:09.883 --> 51:13.736
Oh, uh, yeah, that was just
business as usual.

51:14.906 --> 51:17.073
Come on.

51:17.300 --> 51:19.149
No, I just was, um,
a little confused

51:19.243 --> 51:22.803
As to what my part was
in the snowcast. That's all.

51:22.822 --> 51:25.322
Well, I mean, it's exactly what
we talked about earlier, right?

51:25.416 --> 51:28.142
-We're all doing this together.
-Yeah, right.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.661
Except, you and tatum
are the stars

51:30.755 --> 51:32.922
And I'm just the weatherwoman.

51:34.926 --> 51:38.319
[sighs]
okay.

51:38.412 --> 51:40.654
You thought
that you were hosting

51:40.673 --> 51:43.248
This whole thing alone.

51:43.267 --> 51:44.767
That's why you were so surprised
when you saw

51:44.994 --> 51:46.418
That we'd come here as well,
huh?

51:46.437 --> 51:49.496
Yeah, I think
there was just, um,

51:49.590 --> 51:52.942
Crossed wires from above,
I suppose.

51:53.169 --> 51:56.353
[sighs] right. Yeah.

51:56.505 --> 52:00.932
Well, I don't know if this
helps, but in tatum's defense,

52:01.026 --> 52:02.509
They didn't really tell us

52:02.603 --> 52:04.194
Exactly why we were coming here
as well.

52:04.347 --> 52:07.606
I mean, they just put lisa
in charge and...

52:07.625 --> 52:11.185
Yeah, that's right,
and lisa is a big fan

52:11.278 --> 52:12.853
Of doing what comes naturally

52:12.946 --> 52:15.780
And-and producing pieces
from the heart.

52:15.875 --> 52:16.966
That's why she and I get along.

52:17.117 --> 52:19.951
We produce spots
the same exact way.

52:19.971 --> 52:23.288
And tatum is the exact opposite.

52:23.307 --> 52:24.807
Both of you are.

52:24.958 --> 52:29.052
So polished,
super rehearsed, um...

52:29.147 --> 52:33.390
But that's probably why
you both work so great together.

52:33.542 --> 52:36.226
Also probably why
the younger demographic

52:36.320 --> 52:38.395
Doesn't watch our morning show

52:38.547 --> 52:41.949
Because we're predictable
and a little too stale.

52:43.903 --> 52:45.736
[drake exhales sharply]

52:45.830 --> 52:48.831
I always knew you'd skyrocket
to the top eventually.

52:50.576 --> 52:53.961
And yet you still chose tatum
over me.

52:56.065 --> 52:59.508
Look, all I know is

52:59.660 --> 53:03.328
Our ratings have been up
all week.

53:03.347 --> 53:06.015
And I'm pretty sure
that's because of you.

53:06.242 --> 53:09.018
No, you don't need to be
co-hosting a show with me.

53:10.429 --> 53:12.855
You deserve your very own show.

53:13.082 --> 53:14.148

53:57.793 --> 54:01.311
Has finished
his sappy sentiments

54:01.464 --> 54:04.823
And, uh, nearly made
this old mama cry...

54:07.728 --> 54:10.471
Well, I think we should all
go around the fire

54:10.489 --> 54:13.140
And tell
our best christmas wish.

54:13.233 --> 54:15.584
-Mm.
-Honey, you go first.

54:15.811 --> 54:19.162
Well, oh, okay, well,
that's-that's-that's easy.

54:19.257 --> 54:23.166
Um, my christmas wish, uh,
this year is pretty simple,

54:23.261 --> 54:26.929
And that is to, uh, not screw up
the christmas dinner again,

54:27.080 --> 54:31.416
Because last year
your mother gave me some grief

54:31.435 --> 54:34.661
About the apple-sausage stuffing
was too dry

54:34.755 --> 54:37.831
And the potato dumplings
were undercooked.

54:37.850 --> 54:42.669
So my goal this year
is to dress to impress your ma.

54:42.763 --> 54:45.355
-Okay.
-Grandma, impressed?

54:45.508 --> 54:48.117
-[drake] yeah.
-Not gonna happen.

54:48.268 --> 54:49.785
-Better luck with that one.
-Okay.

54:50.012 --> 54:52.679
Son, what about you?
What's your christmas wish?

54:52.698 --> 54:55.182
[dillon] my christmas wish?

54:55.200 --> 54:58.018
Promotion from associate
to partner at my firm.

54:58.037 --> 55:00.462
Please, please, please,
please, please.

55:00.689 --> 55:02.113
[indistinct chatter]

55:02.133 --> 55:04.041
[sighs] I think I can beat that.

55:04.193 --> 55:07.786
-Ahem...
-Um, okay.

55:07.805 --> 55:11.365
So my very big christmas wish

55:11.383 --> 55:12.891
Is pretty simple.

55:14.294 --> 55:16.461
-Always the same.
-Yup.

55:16.480 --> 55:18.722
-But I wish for world peace.
-World peace.

55:18.874 --> 55:22.151
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you know me well.

55:22.302 --> 55:24.653
-Tatum, what about you?
-Um...

55:24.805 --> 55:27.564
Well, I suppose
it's a little late to be wishing

55:27.658 --> 55:30.901
For holiday love, so I will wish

55:31.053 --> 55:33.887
For chart-topping ratings
this christmas.

55:33.906 --> 55:35.739
-[indistinct chatter]
-I will definitely take that.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.666
But, you know, tatum,

55:37.818 --> 55:39.743
The wenatchee valley
humane society

55:39.837 --> 55:41.411
Isn't too far from here.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.488
I'm not a dog person.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.632
[all laughing]

55:47.903 --> 55:49.920
-Uh, eddie?
-Oh.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.830
My christmas wish, well,

55:51.849 --> 55:54.074
I think it's both of our
christmas wish, which is...

55:54.093 --> 55:57.244
-Well, you know what that is.
-Yeah.

55:57.262 --> 55:59.688
-A little mini-me.
-Hey!

56:01.842 --> 56:04.434
Bridget,
I think yours is probably

56:04.587 --> 56:09.365
A bit easier to accomplish
than ours or drake's.

56:09.516 --> 56:13.594
Yeah, okay, so I actually had
two christmas wishes this year,

56:13.612 --> 56:17.188
And the big one is, you know,
slowly but surely coming true,

56:17.208 --> 56:21.435
And that's for puerto rico
to, you know, come back strong.

56:21.528 --> 56:26.273
Um, and the second one is,

56:26.366 --> 56:28.867
Please let it snow
tomorrow night.

56:28.886 --> 56:31.553
-Oh, right.
-[indistinct chatter]

56:31.780 --> 56:34.615
-Let it snow.
-Well, cheers again, then.

56:34.633 --> 56:39.544
For all our wishes to come true
and to let it snow.

56:39.638 --> 56:43.123
[all] let it snow! Let it snow!

56:43.142 --> 56:44.566
-Yes!
-Cheers!

56:48.480 --> 56:49.571
[sighs]

56:52.576 --> 56:53.892
-Hey.
-Hey.

56:53.986 --> 56:55.744
Do you see it up there?

56:55.971 --> 56:57.988
-That's the north star.
-Beautiful.

56:58.140 --> 57:02.066
It's also called polaris
or the north pole star

57:02.086 --> 57:04.586
Because it's the closest
to the celestial north pole.

57:04.738 --> 57:06.313
-Oh, yeah?
-And...

57:06.331 --> 57:08.649
It's the one that santa uses
each year

57:08.667 --> 57:10.984
To guide his sleigh
all the way home.

57:11.003 --> 57:12.761
That... Mm-hmm.

57:12.988 --> 57:14.430
Did you learn that
in meteorology school?

57:14.581 --> 57:16.432
[chuckles] no!

57:16.659 --> 57:19.435
I actually didn't go
to meteorology school.

57:19.662 --> 57:21.937
I took
some atmospheric science courses

57:22.088 --> 57:26.275
And I know the math models a lot
better than I did back then,

57:26.502 --> 57:29.686
But I got
my bachelor's in journalism.

57:29.780 --> 57:32.172
Oh! I see.

57:32.191 --> 57:35.951
So that's where your love
for reporting comes from.

57:36.178 --> 57:38.120
Yeah.

57:38.271 --> 57:40.939
But I've actually come
to love the weather, though.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.349
It's always changing,

57:42.442 --> 57:45.368
But the power of its patterns

57:45.521 --> 57:47.796
Always remains the same.
I just, I love that.

57:50.042 --> 57:52.859
Did you know that today is the
first day of winter solstice?

57:52.953 --> 57:54.695
-So exciting!
-Remind me.

57:54.788 --> 57:57.306
-What solstice is again?
-[chuckles] so...

57:57.533 --> 57:59.216
It's an astronomical event
that's caused

57:59.310 --> 58:03.386
By the earth's axis and its
orbital motion around the sun.

58:03.481 --> 58:06.389
-Is that what you remember?
-Somethin' like that.

58:06.542 --> 58:09.485
Basically, the sun travels the
shortest path through the sky

58:09.712 --> 58:12.136
At winter solstice,
which means that today

58:12.156 --> 58:14.990
Had the least amount of daylight
in the entire year,

58:15.217 --> 58:18.051
Therefore making tonight
the longest night.

58:18.144 --> 58:20.237
-Cool, huh?
-Fascinating.

58:20.389 --> 58:24.224
And it's probably why
it is so cold tonight.

58:24.243 --> 58:27.485
Yes, it has definitely dropped
a few degrees tonight.

58:27.579 --> 58:29.338
-Hasn't it?
-Uh, yup.

58:29.489 --> 58:32.082
And I am not used to this.

58:32.234 --> 58:34.993
So if you find me frozen
before this all ends,

58:35.012 --> 58:37.328
You can tell my aunt
that at least in the end

58:37.348 --> 58:41.258
I did not feel my toes,
or a lot of everything else.

58:41.352 --> 58:43.852
[laughs]
oh..

58:44.004 --> 58:48.081
Well, it's not gonna help
your toes much, but...

58:48.100 --> 58:52.919
You just got to have somethin'
around your neck.

58:53.013 --> 58:54.921
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

58:55.015 --> 58:58.033
You think it's cold out here.

58:58.184 --> 59:00.369
It's gonna be a lot colder
back at the lodge, I'll bet.

59:00.520 --> 59:04.540
It was freezing last night,
I had to get an extra blanket.

59:04.767 --> 59:06.691
[tatum] but I got you guys
some extra cider.

59:06.785 --> 59:09.770
-Thanks.
-Yeah, thank you.

59:09.788 --> 59:11.362
It's, uh, the lake freeze.

59:11.456 --> 59:13.273
-Most likely.
-Huh?

59:13.292 --> 59:16.034
The reason why it's so cold
at the lodge is because

59:16.053 --> 59:19.037
We're close to the lake, and
the closer you are to the lake

59:19.056 --> 59:22.874
Means more than likely that
the warm air from the land rises

59:22.893 --> 59:24.467
So that the cold air
from the lake can

59:24.620 --> 59:26.061
Fill in the space in between.

59:26.288 --> 59:27.879
Well, I don't know
about any lake freeze,

59:27.898 --> 59:30.214
But I do know
that it is a lot warmer

59:30.309 --> 59:31.900
Over there by the fire.

59:32.052 --> 59:35.720
Yeah, we should, uh, we should
probably get back. Huh?

59:35.739 --> 59:39.132
Yes, I would love
to keep my toes.

59:39.225 --> 59:40.576
-Thank you for this.
-Mm-hmm.

59:42.896 --> 59:45.914
Hm. So, drake.

59:46.066 --> 59:48.584
Um, you and bridget,

59:48.735 --> 59:52.087
Is there something I should know
about going on between you two?

59:52.238 --> 59:55.591
-What?
-I-I-I don't mean to pry.

59:55.818 --> 59:59.428
I just, uh,
I couldn't help but notice.

59:59.579 --> 1:00:03.098
I mean, I asked
if you wanted to have a dinner

1:00:03.249 --> 1:00:05.434
While we were here, and you
didn't think there'd be time,

1:00:05.585 --> 1:00:08.011
But you managed to find time
to have dinner with her,

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:11.998
And you two seem to be
hanging out an awful lot.

1:00:12.017 --> 1:00:14.517
Well...

1:00:14.670 --> 1:00:18.521
I assure you, there's nothing
going on between me and bridget.

1:00:18.616 --> 1:00:20.340
And, look.

1:00:20.359 --> 1:00:23.619
Sorry we didn't have
the time to grab some dinner

1:00:23.770 --> 1:00:25.937
And celebrate, but...

1:00:25.956 --> 1:00:27.530
I don't know,
why don't we, uh...

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:29.199
Why don't we try to have
some breakfast christmas eve

1:00:29.351 --> 1:00:30.517
Before the festhalle event?

1:00:30.610 --> 1:00:32.628
Sure, yeah. That sounds great.

1:00:34.039 --> 1:00:37.357
All right. Lookin' forward.

1:00:37.450 --> 1:00:39.283
-Let's go get warm.
-Okay.

1:00:39.378 --> 1:00:42.262
[instrumental music]

1:00:51.965 --> 1:00:53.723
-[lisa] yeah.
-Thank you.

1:00:53.876 --> 1:00:55.375
No, no, no, ma, ma,
you'll do it too tight.

1:00:55.394 --> 1:00:57.878
Oh!

1:00:57.896 --> 1:00:59.379
-[drake] here, ma, I got it.
-No, no, no.

1:00:59.472 --> 1:01:01.323
Both of you away. Where's dad?

1:01:01.474 --> 1:01:03.808
I am here, right here.

1:01:03.902 --> 1:01:07.721
I've been up all night
baking for today's festivities.

1:01:07.739 --> 1:01:09.981
Mm, those smell good.
What are they?

1:01:10.075 --> 1:01:11.725
<i> Lebkuchen,</i> my friend.

1:01:11.743 --> 1:01:13.894
These are
traditional german cookies,

1:01:13.987 --> 1:01:16.171
Powdered in spice to perfection.

1:01:16.398 --> 1:01:18.915
-Uh, look, here. Have one.
-Oh, yes, sir.

1:01:19.009 --> 1:01:21.176
-Hey, bridget, hurry up!
-[bridget] I'm coming!

1:01:22.179 --> 1:01:23.661
Mm-mm!

1:01:23.755 --> 1:01:25.847
[indistinct chatter]

1:01:27.576 --> 1:01:30.668
-[wally] there you go.
-Thank you.

1:01:30.688 --> 1:01:32.979
Oh, you have some powdered sugar
right there.

1:01:33.765 --> 1:01:35.524
Thank you.

1:01:35.675 --> 1:01:39.027
You ladies
look absolutely stunning.

1:01:39.179 --> 1:01:40.603
-Thank you.
-Well...

1:01:40.756 --> 1:01:43.365
I think it's time
for a snowcast.

1:01:43.516 --> 1:01:46.368
[instrumental music]

1:01:47.112 --> 1:01:50.038
[alphorn music]

1:01:57.697 --> 1:02:01.216
[chuckles]
ooh. This is incredible!

1:02:01.367 --> 1:02:04.219
-Oh, and check it out.
-Ooh! Hey!

1:02:06.724 --> 1:02:09.115
[drake] the weather
doesn't cooperate,

1:02:09.209 --> 1:02:10.467
We bring the snow to us instead.

1:02:10.619 --> 1:02:13.119
Oh, my goodness. Snow machines?

1:02:13.213 --> 1:02:15.288
I love it!
Where did you find this?

1:02:15.307 --> 1:02:17.123
The city is letting us
borrow them. Yeah.

1:02:17.142 --> 1:02:19.383
They, uh, use them
for events and stuff.

1:02:19.403 --> 1:02:22.386
Isn't it great?
It was all drake's idea.

1:02:22.481 --> 1:02:24.072
It's amazing. And look.

1:02:24.299 --> 1:02:26.241
America can think
it's really snowing.

1:02:32.565 --> 1:02:35.992
Okay, wait, um,
so I'm not gonna pretend

1:02:36.144 --> 1:02:38.478
It's really snowing, right?
It's a schtick.

1:02:38.571 --> 1:02:40.922
Like, I lean into the fun
of the fake snow

1:02:41.074 --> 1:02:43.666
And then just announce that the
real stuff is headed this way?

1:02:43.761 --> 1:02:46.077
[chuckles] but the real stuff
is headed this way,

1:02:46.096 --> 1:02:48.171
And that's what
everyone wants to see.

1:02:48.323 --> 1:02:49.598
The illusion is still there.

1:02:49.749 --> 1:02:52.083
So who cares
what we do on camera?

1:02:52.177 --> 1:02:56.012
America wants to see real snow,
just like a real santa.

1:02:56.106 --> 1:02:59.590
Right, so that's just it.
It's not real snow.

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:02.593
So why wouldn't we wait for
the real stuff to hit the ground

1:03:02.613 --> 1:03:03.928
And then roll?

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:05.280
I mean, we could.

1:03:05.507 --> 1:03:07.449
But what
if the real snow doesn't come?

1:03:07.676 --> 1:03:09.192
I mean, lisa's got a point,
I mean,

1:03:09.286 --> 1:03:10.452
We know it's supposed to snow
at some point,

1:03:10.679 --> 1:03:13.029
But there's really no guarantee.
Right?

1:03:13.123 --> 1:03:14.848
I'm not sure we can keep
the fans here all night.

1:03:14.866 --> 1:03:17.700
So, um, couldn't we get
some footage of them now?

1:03:17.853 --> 1:03:21.129
And then you and tatum can do
your spot first and so on?

1:03:23.449 --> 1:03:26.026
Or I can just play into the fact
that it's fake snow,

1:03:26.044 --> 1:03:29.453
Have some fun with it,
I'll promise the real deal later

1:03:29.548 --> 1:03:31.047
And then I'll do a pick-up
tomorrow morning at the lodge

1:03:31.199 --> 1:03:33.958
With the real snow
on the ground.

1:03:33.977 --> 1:03:37.053
Oh, actually that could work.
Like, that could be cute.

1:03:37.147 --> 1:03:39.630
Like a-a quick christmas eve
frolic in the snow

1:03:39.650 --> 1:03:41.875
With all three of you.

1:03:41.968 --> 1:03:46.154
Yeah, announcing merry christmas
and<i> top of the morning, america</i>

1:03:46.306 --> 1:03:49.065
Right here
in christmas town, usa.

1:03:49.217 --> 1:03:51.401
Yeah, sort of like
a-a bookend to the spot,

1:03:51.553 --> 1:03:53.553
And we could do it
as a, as a livestream.

1:03:53.572 --> 1:03:55.388
-Okay. Thanks.
-Yeah.

1:03:55.407 --> 1:03:58.333
But that's not the plan. Is it?

1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:00.001
I mean, we were supposed to do
the script,

1:04:00.228 --> 1:04:03.063
And then bridget announces
the snow,

1:04:03.081 --> 1:04:06.232
And then the snow arrives
here in leavenworth.

1:04:06.326 --> 1:04:08.568
-Cut, and go to print.
-Right.

1:04:08.587 --> 1:04:11.738
But you're not the one doing
the dishonest reporting, tatum.

1:04:11.756 --> 1:04:14.757
Faking the forecast for the sake
of sticking to a script?

1:04:14.852 --> 1:04:17.501
I mean, that's just making me
the joke, isn't it?

1:04:17.596 --> 1:04:21.598
But it's not for the script.
It's for the sake of the story.

1:04:21.692 --> 1:04:24.526
In case you forgot, everyone
lives for a great story.

1:04:24.753 --> 1:04:27.770
It's junk food for the soul,
right, lisa?

1:04:27.923 --> 1:04:29.155
Not always.

1:04:31.276 --> 1:04:34.352
Oh, think about it. And if you
don't wanna do it, I will.

1:04:34.371 --> 1:04:36.354
[scoffs]

1:04:36.448 --> 1:04:39.616
Um, well, I'm gonna go take
some selfies with our fans.

1:04:39.710 --> 1:04:40.876
You should, too.

1:04:46.791 --> 1:04:48.884
You do what you want to do.

1:04:49.035 --> 1:04:50.701
It's your spot. Okay?

1:04:50.721 --> 1:04:54.222
Thanks.
I'm just gonna need a minute.

1:04:54.449 --> 1:04:55.515
Yeah.

1:04:58.954 --> 1:05:00.520
Will you check on her
in a little bit?

1:05:02.900 --> 1:05:06.459
I don't know what to do,<i> titi.</i>
Am I overreacting?

1:05:06.552 --> 1:05:08.570
I mean, because maybe,
maybe I am just

1:05:08.797 --> 1:05:10.572
The silly weather girl
everyone says I am

1:05:10.723 --> 1:05:12.982
And I'm just making a big deal
out of nothing.

1:05:13.076 --> 1:05:15.985
[marta]<i> no, sobrina.</i>
<i> What if your mother heard?</i>

1:05:16.079 --> 1:05:18.821
<i> You're so much more,</i>
<i> and if the snow won't fall</i>

1:05:18.916 --> 1:05:21.157
<i> For that stuck-up show host,</i>
<i> neither should you.</i>

1:05:21.251 --> 1:05:22.417
[laughing]

1:05:23.828 --> 1:05:27.981
Hm. Okay. Well, thank you.

1:05:27.999 --> 1:05:29.816
I have to go,
we're gonna be starting soon.

1:05:29.834 --> 1:05:32.001
But I will see you
tomorrow night for mass.

1:05:32.154 --> 1:05:34.763
[marta]<i> sounds good, mija.</i>
<i> I love you.</i>

1:05:34.914 --> 1:05:36.264
I love you, too. Muah.

1:05:38.602 --> 1:05:40.251
[exhales sharply]

1:05:40.270 --> 1:05:42.845
So sad you're leaving so soon.

1:05:42.998 --> 1:05:45.014
Really wish you could
come to the festhalle.

1:05:45.167 --> 1:05:48.944
Yeah, me, too, I've-I've fallen
in love with leavenworth,

1:05:49.095 --> 1:05:50.946
Despite this cold.

1:05:51.097 --> 1:05:54.357
[laughing]
yeah. Yeah.

1:05:54.509 --> 1:05:57.601
Um, you know,
maybe when I get back from la

1:05:57.621 --> 1:06:01.181
Or after the new year,
I don't know,

1:06:01.274 --> 1:06:03.683
We can have dinner sometime?

1:06:03.702 --> 1:06:13.134
-Yeah, I'd like that.
-Good.

1:06:13.361 --> 1:06:15.303
So tell me,
how does this thing work anyway?

1:06:15.530 --> 1:06:16.972
Oh, y-you don't have to do
anything.

1:06:17.123 --> 1:06:18.622
Just click
your heels together twice

1:06:18.642 --> 1:06:21.142
And I'll give you as much snow
as you want.

1:06:21.369 --> 1:06:23.645
Perfect, well, let's turn
that thing all the way up

1:06:23.872 --> 1:06:26.039
'cause I'm dreaming
of a white christmas.

1:06:26.057 --> 1:06:28.149
You got it.

1:06:28.301 --> 1:06:31.544
By the way, do you have any idea
what's going on with those two?

1:06:31.563 --> 1:06:34.047
I don't mean to be
a nosy rudolph, but...

1:06:34.065 --> 1:06:37.659
Who? My brother and bridget?

1:06:37.810 --> 1:06:41.145
Well, of course, sparks are
flying. They have been all week.

1:06:41.239 --> 1:06:44.741
Drake's had a thing for bridget
for, for forever, really.

1:06:44.835 --> 1:06:47.243
I'm sorry?

1:06:47.395 --> 1:06:49.746
What? You didn't know? Come on.

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:52.990
I figured, surely of all people,
you would know.

1:06:53.010 --> 1:06:54.901
[chuckles] what's that
supposed to mean?

1:06:54.919 --> 1:06:57.237
Nothing, never mind.
Forget I said anything.

1:06:57.330 --> 1:06:59.347
It's... You know,
it's not my place to--

1:06:59.574 --> 1:07:02.166
Dillon,
tell me what you know now,

1:07:02.185 --> 1:07:06.079
So I don't have to ask drake
about it live on camera later.

1:07:06.097 --> 1:07:08.690
Fine, fine. Fine.

1:07:11.253 --> 1:07:14.011
Drake wanted bridget,
but I think ultimately

1:07:14.031 --> 1:07:17.198
The network chose you
because they wanted bridget

1:07:17.350 --> 1:07:19.942
To solo the nightly news
to get the ratings back up.

1:07:20.095 --> 1:07:21.352
And drake was relieved
because he didn't want

1:07:21.371 --> 1:07:22.686
A conflict of interest
on his hand

1:07:22.706 --> 1:07:24.706
Because he had a crush
on his co-host.

1:07:27.210 --> 1:07:28.951
-That's all.
-Wait.

1:07:29.046 --> 1:07:32.213
-So I was a consolation prize?
-I wouldn't say that.

1:07:32.365 --> 1:07:34.774
I mean,
he didn't even know you then.

1:07:34.793 --> 1:07:36.959
I mean,
when he came home last year,

1:07:37.112 --> 1:07:38.461
He said that you were new
to the network.

1:07:38.613 --> 1:07:41.872
I was. I was new to the news.

1:07:41.966 --> 1:07:44.059
And apparently I still am

1:07:44.210 --> 1:07:46.394
Because all of this
is news to me.

1:07:48.290 --> 1:07:50.065
But...

1:07:50.292 --> 1:07:52.734
Whatever. Everything happens
for a reason, right?

1:07:52.885 --> 1:07:55.695
And the show must go on.

1:07:56.631 --> 1:07:57.697
So...

1:08:02.137 --> 1:08:04.412
[indistinct chatter]

1:08:04.564 --> 1:08:07.582
Good evening, everyone, I'm
lisa liu lawson from kqv news.

1:08:07.809 --> 1:08:09.992
And thank you so much
for being here

1:08:10.145 --> 1:08:13.254
At our annual snowcast this year
right here in leavenworth.

1:08:13.406 --> 1:08:16.424
[crowd cheering]

1:08:16.576 --> 1:08:18.818
Uh, just a few quick things, uh,
once our cameras start rolling,

1:08:18.837 --> 1:08:20.929
I need you to keep your talking
to a whisper,

1:08:21.156 --> 1:08:23.156
Silence your cell phones,
and, of course,

1:08:23.249 --> 1:08:26.159
Cheer on our commentators
on air and...

1:08:26.177 --> 1:08:28.995
Oh, oh, yes, um, and don't
forget, while you're here,

1:08:29.088 --> 1:08:30.830
Before you leave,
make sure you grab a bag

1:08:30.849 --> 1:08:33.349
Of the yummy delicious
<i> lebkuchen</i> cookies,

1:08:33.501 --> 1:08:35.443
Courtesy of the kincaids.

1:08:35.595 --> 1:08:38.596
Now, without further ado,
I give you drake kincaid

1:08:38.615 --> 1:08:40.448
And tatum tilson
of<i> top of the morning!</i>

1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:43.451
[crowd cheering]

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:49.958
Man, oh, man, doesn't feel like
a regular morning.

1:08:50.109 --> 1:08:53.853
Does it, drake? Oh, wait, that's
'cause it's not morning at all!

1:08:53.872 --> 1:08:57.615
For once we are up way
past our bedtime, huh?

1:08:57.709 --> 1:09:01.210
Well, it's worth it to see
all these beautiful lights.

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:04.788
Here we are in beautiful
downtown leavenworth,

1:09:04.808 --> 1:09:08.292
A charming bavarian hideaway
nestled deep in the mountains

1:09:08.311 --> 1:09:11.146
Just south of lake wenatchee,
washington,

1:09:11.297 --> 1:09:14.131
Where you can guarantee you're
gonna quench your penchant

1:09:14.225 --> 1:09:16.726
For all things christmas.

1:09:16.878 --> 1:09:18.969
That's right, tatum,
whether taking a stroll

1:09:18.989 --> 1:09:20.822
Through the nutcracker museum

1:09:20.973 --> 1:09:23.992
Or having a gingerbread party
in the gingerbread factory,

1:09:24.143 --> 1:09:25.401
It's easy to see
we didn't coin it

1:09:25.553 --> 1:09:27.829
Christmas town, usa,
for nothing.

1:09:28.056 --> 1:09:30.331
There's only one thing missing
this week.

1:09:31.501 --> 1:09:33.910
A fresh snowfall.

1:09:34.004 --> 1:09:37.730
[tatum] but I think
tonight just might be the night.

1:09:37.749 --> 1:09:40.900
One can hope, right,
but even if it doesn't snow,

1:09:40.919 --> 1:09:43.678
It simply won't take away
the magic we're feeling

1:09:43.829 --> 1:09:46.239
This christmas,
and when we come back,

1:09:46.257 --> 1:09:49.742
A very special hello
from your nightly newscaster

1:09:49.835 --> 1:09:52.595
Always delivering
your favorite forecasts,

1:09:52.689 --> 1:09:53.930
Bridget torres.

1:09:54.024 --> 1:09:55.356
So stick with us.

1:09:57.027 --> 1:10:01.029
-Nice.
-If it doesn't snow?

1:10:01.180 --> 1:10:04.014
Drake, do you remember when
you and I used to be a team?

1:10:04.108 --> 1:10:06.850
Or are you so starry-eyed for
the weatherwoman, you forgot?

1:10:06.870 --> 1:10:09.595
[scoffs] I'm not starry-eyed
over bridget.

1:10:09.689 --> 1:10:13.023
-What are you...
-[scoffs] fine. Whatever.

1:10:13.117 --> 1:10:15.877
Just know that you may not have
chosen her for the show

1:10:16.104 --> 1:10:17.695
Because of your little crush
or whatever,

1:10:17.789 --> 1:10:21.958
But the execs chose me.
So let's not forget that, okay?

1:10:22.110 --> 1:10:25.035
Drake, is that true?

1:10:25.055 --> 1:10:26.946
Because I thought
you picked tatum

1:10:27.039 --> 1:10:30.800
Because of your commonalities.

1:10:30.952 --> 1:10:34.044
Bridget, look.
I wasn't lying, all right?

1:10:34.064 --> 1:10:37.881
The choice wasn't mine
ultimately.

1:10:37.901 --> 1:10:40.735
Everyone loved you, all right,
but the execs wanted someone

1:10:40.886 --> 1:10:45.055
To liven nighttime news,
otherwise it was gonna die.

1:10:45.075 --> 1:10:46.983
You were that person.

1:10:47.135 --> 1:10:51.412
And I didn't fight them
because, yeah, I like you

1:10:51.564 --> 1:10:55.083
And I didn't want it
to get weird.

1:10:55.234 --> 1:10:56.809
And I mean,
we all know that tatum

1:10:56.902 --> 1:10:59.645
Is a great candidate as well.

1:10:59.664 --> 1:11:02.924
Hey, guys, uh,
we're back in ten, nine...

1:11:08.006 --> 1:11:10.914
And we're back here
with bridget torres,

1:11:11.009 --> 1:11:14.602
Our favorite forecaster who may
just have some good news for us.

1:11:14.754 --> 1:11:17.346
Yes. Uh, I believe I do, tatum.
Thank you so much.

1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:21.943
Now, while we may not have
the real deal here, uh,

1:11:22.170 --> 1:11:24.854
Faking it seems to be the answer
sometimes.

1:11:24.948 --> 1:11:26.948
So, hey, why not?

1:11:27.099 --> 1:11:29.767
It's christmas, right?
So everybody say it with me.

1:11:29.786 --> 1:11:34.104
Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow!

1:11:34.124 --> 1:11:35.606
Yee-haw!

1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:38.459
[instrumental music]

1:11:43.133 --> 1:11:45.541
Bridget?

1:11:45.693 --> 1:11:49.378
Oh. Hey, um,
where-where's-where's bridget?

1:11:49.531 --> 1:11:52.623
She decided to stay
at beaver valley tonight.

1:11:52.717 --> 1:11:56.144
Y-yeah, lisa and dillon took her
over just about a minute ago.

1:11:56.295 --> 1:11:59.981
[sighs] oh, I'm sorry, honey,
I thought you knew.

1:12:02.319 --> 1:12:04.377
[mellow music]

1:12:04.395 --> 1:12:05.778
Thanks, mom.

1:12:12.478 --> 1:12:14.162
Oh, it's really coming down
out there.

1:12:14.313 --> 1:12:17.239
Yeah, and my flight out
of wenatchee is on a big delay.

1:12:17.392 --> 1:12:19.292
Ugh! This is the worst.

1:12:24.990 --> 1:12:27.567
Son, you want some coffee?

1:12:27.585 --> 1:12:30.160
Uh, sure, please, thanks.

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:31.662
[wally] comin' up.

1:12:31.756 --> 1:12:35.241
-Hey. You okay?
-Mm.

1:12:35.259 --> 1:12:37.426
Drake, honey,
why don't you give her a call?

1:12:37.579 --> 1:12:39.336
-She hasn't left town yet.
-Yeah.

1:12:39.356 --> 1:12:41.171
I was supposed to take her
to the airport this morning,

1:12:41.191 --> 1:12:43.416
But all the flights
out of wenatchee are canceled

1:12:43.434 --> 1:12:45.193
Or delayed because
of all the ice on the ground.

1:12:45.344 --> 1:12:47.653
Yeah, but she has to get home,
though.

1:12:49.607 --> 1:12:53.275
Hey, dad, can't your suv
make it into seattle?

1:12:53.428 --> 1:12:55.111
I mean, I'm sure flights are
running just fine out of there.

1:12:55.205 --> 1:12:59.207
-No?
-Mm, probably.

1:12:59.434 --> 1:13:01.542
Maybe you could offer
to take her there.

1:13:01.694 --> 1:13:05.454
Yeah, but I'm not sure she wants
to talk to me right now, and...

1:13:05.607 --> 1:13:07.048
I don't blame her, you know?

1:13:09.719 --> 1:13:11.177
I'mma go outside.

1:13:12.447 --> 1:13:15.223
[instrumental music]

1:13:18.119 --> 1:13:19.227
Morning.

1:13:20.471 --> 1:13:22.972
Mm, something smells yummy.

1:13:23.066 --> 1:13:24.548
Guess it's too bad drake and I
are having breakfast

1:13:24.567 --> 1:13:25.641
In town today.

1:13:25.793 --> 1:13:27.309
Really?

1:13:27.462 --> 1:13:28.903
Are you so sure about that?

1:13:29.054 --> 1:13:31.797
Why? What's going on?

1:13:31.891 --> 1:13:33.799
I don't think drake was thrilled

1:13:33.893 --> 1:13:35.968
With the show you put on
yesterday.

1:13:36.061 --> 1:13:37.987
And I don't guess you know,

1:13:38.139 --> 1:13:42.917
But bridget left yesterday
because of you.

1:13:43.068 --> 1:13:45.995
But good news is, at least
your holiday wish came true.

1:13:46.147 --> 1:13:48.589
Ratings are through the roof.

1:13:48.741 --> 1:13:50.091
You're a big hit, tatum.

1:13:51.428 --> 1:13:52.760
Congrats.

1:13:56.081 --> 1:13:58.933
[instrumental music]

1:14:16.511 --> 1:14:17.577
Morning.

1:14:21.516 --> 1:14:24.533
I suppose having breakfast
is off the table.

1:14:24.686 --> 1:14:27.110
Nope, there's still some
on the dining-room table

1:14:27.130 --> 1:14:28.629
If you want any.

1:14:31.042 --> 1:14:32.592
I guess that's fair.

1:14:36.214 --> 1:14:39.699
Look, I'm sorry if I ruined
things between you and bridget.

1:14:39.717 --> 1:14:42.201
I didn't like seeing you
have so much chemistry

1:14:42.294 --> 1:14:44.537
On camera with someone else.

1:14:44.555 --> 1:14:47.723
I've gotten used to it being you
and I the world wants to see.

1:14:47.817 --> 1:14:49.817
Yeah, but, tatum,

1:14:50.044 --> 1:14:53.395
You do realize
there is no you and I?

1:14:53.490 --> 1:14:55.156
I do now.

1:14:57.552 --> 1:15:00.402
I mean, I-I've seen
what's been happening

1:15:00.497 --> 1:15:03.647
With you and her all week.
The whole world has.

1:15:03.741 --> 1:15:07.126
It's very... Authentic.

1:15:08.505 --> 1:15:11.506
I guess I just wished

1:15:11.733 --> 1:15:14.175
It was happening
between you and me is all.

1:15:15.828 --> 1:15:18.420
I'm sorry for that.

1:15:18.573 --> 1:15:21.090
I know firsthand
what it's like to like someone

1:15:21.242 --> 1:15:22.332
You have to be
professional with.

1:15:22.352 --> 1:15:25.427
It's... It's not easy.

1:15:25.580 --> 1:15:26.521
Right.

1:15:28.432 --> 1:15:31.174
And I-I realized pretty quickly
after we got to this

1:15:31.269 --> 1:15:35.363
Romantic town that it wasn't
what I thought it was gonna be.

1:15:35.590 --> 1:15:39.700
And that's fine, I guess,
that it didn't...

1:15:43.765 --> 1:15:45.039
And more so just...

1:15:47.377 --> 1:15:50.027
It hurt my feelings thinking
that I was your second choice.

1:15:50.121 --> 1:15:52.104
-So...
-Look, tatum.

1:15:52.197 --> 1:15:54.865
You and I have an amazing show

1:15:54.959 --> 1:15:57.443
I'm extremely proud of.

1:15:57.461 --> 1:16:00.388
I have zero regrets
doing this with you.

1:16:01.707 --> 1:16:03.966
I just, you know, I hope

1:16:04.118 --> 1:16:07.562
This show is enough, that's all.

1:16:13.570 --> 1:16:16.720
So I wasn't just some
consolation prize for you, then?

1:16:16.814 --> 1:16:20.800
What? Heck, no! Are you
kidding me? You're tatum tilson.

1:16:20.893 --> 1:16:23.703
Morning-show host
extraordinaire. Come on.

1:16:25.582 --> 1:16:26.747
Thank you.

1:16:27.900 --> 1:16:29.542
And again, I'm sorry.

1:16:30.661 --> 1:16:31.752
It's fine.

1:16:33.815 --> 1:16:36.257
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:16:41.246 --> 1:16:43.172
[millie] hey there. Huh.

1:16:43.324 --> 1:16:45.916
Hi! What are you doing here?

1:16:45.935 --> 1:16:48.603
I think you forgot something
at the lodge.

1:16:48.754 --> 1:16:51.105
Aw. Thank you.

1:16:51.256 --> 1:16:54.500
I was in such a rush to get out
before the snowfall got worse,

1:16:54.518 --> 1:16:57.427
That I just totally forgot.

1:16:57.447 --> 1:17:00.430
It's fine.
I'm happy to swing it by.

1:17:00.450 --> 1:17:02.675
I'm on my way into town anyway
to get ready

1:17:02.693 --> 1:17:05.268
For the performance at
the festhalle this afternoon.

1:17:05.288 --> 1:17:09.181
Oh, that's right. Oh, I'm
so sorry I'm gonna miss that.

1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:10.791
You sure you have to? Uh...

1:17:11.018 --> 1:17:13.443
Dillon told us that
all the flights are delayed.

1:17:13.463 --> 1:17:15.946
-Yeah.
-A-any update on yours?

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:19.375
Yeah. Mine's actually delayed
until 8:45.

1:17:19.527 --> 1:17:22.544
It looks like I won't make it
in time for mass, unfortunately.

1:17:22.697 --> 1:17:26.365
You know, I think
drake is a little bit afraid

1:17:26.384 --> 1:17:28.384
To talk to you.

1:17:28.536 --> 1:17:32.146
He feels so bad
about everything.

1:17:32.297 --> 1:17:36.133
And I know he would love
to drive you to seattle

1:17:36.152 --> 1:17:39.302
To catch an earlier flight
I-if you, if you'd let him.

1:17:39.397 --> 1:17:41.397
Yeah, you know, I just...

1:17:41.549 --> 1:17:43.065
I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

1:17:43.159 --> 1:17:46.327
I'm just really not ready
to see him right now.

1:17:46.478 --> 1:17:49.646
I'm still so confused
about everything.

1:17:49.666 --> 1:17:53.316
Yeah, yeah,
I, I-I totally get it.

1:17:53.411 --> 1:17:57.338
And normally, I am not one
to get into my son's business...

1:17:58.341 --> 1:18:01.825
But, bridget...

1:18:01.844 --> 1:18:06.013
I have never seen him this crazy
about anyone, like, ever.

1:18:06.165 --> 1:18:07.330
You know what's funny
about that?

1:18:07.350 --> 1:18:09.684
It's just that this whole time I

1:18:09.835 --> 1:18:11.001
Thought he didn't even
care for me.

1:18:11.095 --> 1:18:14.671
No, on the contrary.

1:18:14.691 --> 1:18:18.083
Drake has always felt
you guys were a perfect fit.

1:18:18.102 --> 1:18:21.344
Uh, and I know he would've
asked you out then, too,

1:18:21.439 --> 1:18:25.182
If tatum
hadn't muddled the lines

1:18:25.201 --> 1:18:29.019
And caused you
to start avoiding him.

1:18:29.113 --> 1:18:31.947
<i> Se fue al garete.</i> Wow.

1:18:32.041 --> 1:18:34.709
Okay, so this whole time
he didn't say anything

1:18:34.860 --> 1:18:37.545
Just because he was trying
to keep it professional

1:18:37.696 --> 1:18:39.772
And not throw these execs
under the bus?

1:18:39.790 --> 1:18:43.050
-Yeah.
-Wow.

1:18:43.202 --> 1:18:45.294
I don't know
if I want to commend him

1:18:45.446 --> 1:18:47.947
Or if I just want to, argh,
scream at him.

1:18:47.965 --> 1:18:50.707
Well, I suppose

1:18:50.801 --> 1:18:54.895
If you come to the festhalle,
you can take your pick.

1:18:55.122 --> 1:18:56.230
Hm.

1:19:04.632 --> 1:19:07.466
You guys look great.

1:19:07.485 --> 1:19:09.985
Wow, this is so incredible!

1:19:10.137 --> 1:19:11.203
Isn't it?

1:19:12.306 --> 1:19:13.748
Oh, my gosh.

1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:16.900
Oh, oh, honey,
I'm gonna take this.

1:19:16.919 --> 1:19:18.978
-It's-it's the network calling.
-Oh, babe.

1:19:18.996 --> 1:19:20.570
Fingers crossed. Good luck.

1:19:20.664 --> 1:19:22.089
Lisa liu lawson speaking.

1:19:25.094 --> 1:19:28.262
[tatum] ugh. Should I go
talk to her?

1:19:28.413 --> 1:19:30.431
If you think you should.

1:19:32.268 --> 1:19:34.918
I should go talk to her,
shouldn't I? You think?

1:19:34.937 --> 1:19:37.104
-You should go talk to her.
-Yup.

1:19:38.849 --> 1:19:40.775
Thank you. Appreciate that.

1:19:41.002 --> 1:19:43.018
I'll take a gluhwein, too.
Thank you.

1:19:43.170 --> 1:19:47.189
And I got hers. I owe you one.

1:19:47.341 --> 1:19:49.691
I... Thanks, uh,
but you really didn't need to.

1:19:49.844 --> 1:19:51.452
You don't owe me anything,
tatum.

1:19:51.603 --> 1:19:54.437
Actually, I do.
I owe you an apology.

1:19:54.457 --> 1:19:56.439
I never should've gotten jealous

1:19:56.459 --> 1:20:00.019
And I never should've felt
threatened of you and drake.

1:20:00.112 --> 1:20:02.445
He's my co-host. Nothing more.

1:20:02.465 --> 1:20:05.466
And I had no right to get
between the two of you, so...

1:20:06.785 --> 1:20:09.136
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

1:20:09.363 --> 1:20:12.306
But, uh, honestly,
I don't even think

1:20:12.533 --> 1:20:15.125
There's anything
to get in between, so...

1:20:15.144 --> 1:20:17.870
We both know there is.

1:20:17.888 --> 1:20:20.055
But since I'm way beyond
trying to convince you

1:20:20.149 --> 1:20:23.800
To do things my way,
I will say this one thing.

1:20:23.894 --> 1:20:26.320
Drake's a really good guy

1:20:26.547 --> 1:20:28.489
And you both deserve
someone good.

1:20:34.330 --> 1:20:35.454
Cheers.

1:20:36.724 --> 1:20:38.223
Cheers.

1:20:38.242 --> 1:20:39.241

1:21:32.555 --> 1:21:35.389
[crowd cheering]

1:21:40.304 --> 1:21:43.380
Oh, hey. Eeh.
We have to tell you something.

1:21:43.474 --> 1:21:45.399
-Oh, okay.
-Come.

1:21:47.219 --> 1:21:49.811
-Um...
-Oh, all right.

1:21:49.906 --> 1:21:52.222
Bridget, you will never guess
who just called us.

1:21:52.316 --> 1:21:54.967
-Who?
-Rashida george.

1:21:55.060 --> 1:21:57.136
-The head of the network.
-Okay.

1:21:57.154 --> 1:21:59.896
She's been watching you all week
and she thinks it's time

1:21:59.916 --> 1:22:04.084
That we give you
your very own show.

1:22:04.921 --> 1:22:07.980
What? Seriously?

1:22:07.998 --> 1:22:10.999
-My own show?
-Well, I mean, our show.

1:22:11.093 --> 1:22:14.577
Eddie and I will produce it.
But, yes, your own show.

1:22:14.672 --> 1:22:17.489
<i> Ay, bendito.</i> Really?

1:22:17.508 --> 1:22:20.267
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

1:22:20.494 --> 1:22:22.995
Okay, so, uh,
what else did she say?

1:22:23.088 --> 1:22:25.088
Oh, uh, it'll be mid-morning,

1:22:25.107 --> 1:22:27.849
Following directly after,
uh,<i> top of the morning.</i>

1:22:27.944 --> 1:22:30.927
Yeah, and you get to choose
your very own co-host.

1:22:30.947 --> 1:22:33.447
-A very merry christmas to you.
-What?

1:22:33.674 --> 1:22:36.508
Anyone you want.
Or go at it on your own.

1:22:36.527 --> 1:22:38.101
It's totally up to you.

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:41.438
Wow, I just...
I can't believe this.

1:22:41.457 --> 1:22:45.684
Thank you, both, so much
for believing in me. Thank you.

1:22:45.703 --> 1:22:49.296
-What's not to believe?
-Thank you.

1:22:49.448 --> 1:22:50.464
-[eddie chuckles]
-wow.

1:22:50.615 --> 1:22:52.040
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:22:52.193 --> 1:22:53.950
Well, hello.

1:22:53.970 --> 1:22:55.877
You're looking at the new face
of the morning show

1:22:56.030 --> 1:22:58.380
Following directly after yours.

1:22:58.532 --> 1:23:01.383
-Wait, really?
-Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

1:23:01.535 --> 1:23:04.553
-Wow! Congrats.
-Thank you.

1:23:04.705 --> 1:23:05.721
-To all of you.
-Thank you.

1:23:05.873 --> 1:23:07.964
-Thank you.
-Happy for you.

1:23:07.984 --> 1:23:09.984
[chuckles]
yeah...

1:23:10.135 --> 1:23:13.378
Well, now it's time for us to go
get some of that gluhwein, huh?

1:23:13.397 --> 1:23:16.824
Well, I think that's
an excellent idea. Let's go.

1:23:17.051 --> 1:23:19.660
-See you later.
-Congratulations again.

1:23:22.056 --> 1:23:23.646
So...

1:23:23.666 --> 1:23:26.333
So, looks like
you're gonna have

1:23:26.485 --> 1:23:29.819
Some morning competition,
kincaid.

1:23:29.839 --> 1:23:32.172
Well, I mean,
it's not really competition

1:23:32.399 --> 1:23:33.823
If we're on the same team,
though, right?

1:23:33.917 --> 1:23:36.176
-Yeah, guess not.
-Hm.

1:23:36.403 --> 1:23:38.679
But I guess we're gonna have
to find a way

1:23:38.830 --> 1:23:41.682
To work around each other,
so we're gonna have to learn

1:23:41.833 --> 1:23:43.575
How to get along, huh?

1:23:43.594 --> 1:23:45.519
Yeah. I guess so.

1:23:47.005 --> 1:23:48.505
I promise I'll try my best

1:23:48.599 --> 1:23:51.099
If you finally allow me

1:23:51.252 --> 1:23:53.694
To take you on a proper date.

1:23:56.774 --> 1:23:58.774
Okay, fine.

1:23:58.926 --> 1:24:01.426
But I'm just so curious

1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:04.930
As to why
you never asked me out before.

1:24:04.948 --> 1:24:07.933
So they don't bring me
on to your show,

1:24:07.951 --> 1:24:09.877
They hire me
for the nighttime news,

1:24:10.028 --> 1:24:11.937
Then you see me at work
sometimes

1:24:11.955 --> 1:24:14.956
And you never asked me out?

1:24:15.051 --> 1:24:19.202
Oh, so, uh, are you talking
about in the hallways

1:24:19.221 --> 1:24:22.890
When you'd completely avoid me
by looking the other way?

1:24:23.041 --> 1:24:26.785
Or the break room you'd escape
from the second I came in?

1:24:26.804 --> 1:24:28.896
Oh, I know it must've been

1:24:29.123 --> 1:24:31.565
The, uh, office holiday party
last year.

1:24:31.716 --> 1:24:34.126
You completely ignored me.

1:24:34.144 --> 1:24:36.795
And then to make matters worse,
you were on a cell phone call

1:24:36.814 --> 1:24:38.721
When I approached you
from the bar.

1:24:38.816 --> 1:24:41.241
So I'm at a loss of words.

1:24:41.393 --> 1:24:44.227
-Yeah. We.. Yes.
-Hm.

1:24:44.246 --> 1:24:46.080
I was, I was pretty brutal, huh?

1:24:46.307 --> 1:24:48.640
Nah, it's...

1:24:48.733 --> 1:24:51.143
[exhales sharply]
it's fine.

1:24:51.161 --> 1:24:53.587
-I mean, you didn't know me.
-Yeah, that's right.

1:24:55.149 --> 1:24:57.907
But you know
what's kind of funny?

1:24:57.927 --> 1:25:02.504
Because you're a lot
like your hometown here.

1:25:02.656 --> 1:25:04.506
Real frozen on the outside,

1:25:04.658 --> 1:25:08.602
But, but all warm and cozy
in the center.

1:25:10.606 --> 1:25:14.066
Well, speaking of hometowns...

1:25:15.945 --> 1:25:19.020
I should probably
get you out of here.

1:25:19.173 --> 1:25:22.691
Yeah, we got a plane we need
you to get on from seattle,

1:25:22.843 --> 1:25:25.344
7:00 p.M. Sharp,
so that we can get you home

1:25:25.362 --> 1:25:28.104
In time for midnight mass.

1:25:28.198 --> 1:25:30.607
-Really?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1:25:30.626 --> 1:25:33.627
We're gonna head out
in my dad's suv.

summer activities that you love?

1:25:58.545 --> 1:26:00.729

I really like your family, too.

1:26:08.664 --> 1:26:10.122

1:26:11.483 --> 1:26:15.727
Uh, you know what my mom says?

1:26:15.820 --> 1:26:18.321
Happy kids make a happy home?

1:26:18.415 --> 1:26:20.399
