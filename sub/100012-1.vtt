23:09.400 --> 23:11.880
What, do you want the chairman?
Do you? Hmm?

23:12.960 --> 23:17.921
With his fancy briefcase
and his gold fountain pen, eh?

23:20.440 --> 23:21.646
What do you want?

23:23.160 --> 23:24.161
Chairman...

23:25.480 --> 23:27.562
...or doorman? Hm?

23:27.680 --> 23:31.969
You think we can fuck and it'll be OK
and I'll be quiet. Well, I won't.

23:33.720 --> 23:37.088
Every week, your brother's down in London,
making out he's fucking Robin Hood,

23:37.200 --> 23:40.568
champion of the people, while you're
up here running the racket for him.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.001
And according to your "arrangement",
if anything should happen,

23:43.120 --> 23:45.851
it'd be you who takes the blame,
does the time or swings for it.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.242
- And what do you want?
- I want you...

23:56.080 --> 23:57.366
...to take the opportunity

23:57.480 --> 24:01.041
that God and the New York Stock Exchange
has presented to you.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

24:02.440 --> 24:04.329
EDNA: Mr Shelby,
the meeting will be starting soon.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.681
Yeah. All right.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.125
Be right there.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.121

OK, now...

24:56.840 --> 24:58.330
Mmm, they're nice.

24:59.480 --> 25:00.481
...let's begin.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.685
Yesterday, as you all know,
there was a fucking terrible...

25:08.000 --> 25:11.288
There was a terrible disaster. Hm?

25:11.400 --> 25:12.640
It wasn'tjust for us.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.331
It was for the whole world.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.847
Happened in New York.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.081
That's where it happened.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.964
And it slowly spread to London.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.682
And then to, er, fucking Hong Kong. Hm?

25:31.680 --> 25:33.728
Whole thing...whole thing went up.

25:34.720 --> 25:38.327
Well, actually the whole thing
went fucking down but...

25:42.120 --> 25:45.567
...we wasn't the only ones hurt by this.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.207
Whole world is hurt.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.601
A lot of people.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.405
In the papers.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.124
It's all over the news.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.163
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Arthur?

25:59.280 --> 26:01.044
Shouldn't we just wait for Thomas?

26:01.160 --> 26:04.403
Polly, Arthur's now
the chairman of the board.

26:06.280 --> 26:09.363
LEON: Er, Mr Chairman,
perhaps while we wait for Thomas,

26:09.480 --> 26:14.566
I might lighten the gloom and express, as
a relatively new member of this company,

26:14.680 --> 26:17.809
what a pleasure it is to be in a boardroom
that has so many females in it,

26:17.920 --> 26:23.086
and all females who are both
sharp-witted and decorative.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.568
ARTHUR: Yeah, well, we're a very modern
company, Mr Greene.

26:26.680 --> 26:27.647
Indeed.

26:27.760 --> 26:33.130
Although there are still some among us
who cling to their old-fashioned values.

(DOOR OPENS)

26:36.360 --> 26:37.441
How far have we got?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.122
We've established
that ladies are decorative.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.844
ARTHUR: We've only just sat down, Tom.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.851
Actually, um, Arthur has some documents
that he'd like to hand out.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.166
THOMAS: Yeah?

26:48.280 --> 26:49.566
What documents?

26:51.080 --> 26:55.563
I was just explaining to everyone, Tom,
that, um, well, we're fucked.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.809
- Ain't that right? Hm?
- Yes and no. (CLEARS THROAT)

27:00.120 --> 27:03.841
It is true that a large proportion
of the company's funds

27:03.960 --> 27:07.089
were invested in American stocks
and shares.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.440
Invested or hidden?

27:10.240 --> 27:12.527
All investments are approved
by the board, Linda.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.610
Only the ones that went
through the books, Thomas.

27:16.880 --> 27:21.169
Linda, after this meeting there will
be another meeting, forjust family.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.367
Did we vote on this?

27:28.560 --> 27:29.527
Arthur?

27:29.640 --> 27:31.051
"Arthur, can't you control your wife?"

We are a very modern company, Mr Greene.

As nonexecutive director of the company,
I need the permission from the chairman

28:11.120 --> 28:13.964
to present my strategy to the boa rd.

- All right, Mr Shelby.

- Mr Shelby...
- Yeah?

29:31.920 --> 29:33.206
...thank you for what you did.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.560
What did I do?

29:34.680 --> 29:37.081
He was going to evict us,
that bastard Fellows.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.567
Now he's cut our rent in half.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.921
Good. Glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

- All the way, brother. All the way.
- Revolution, man.

they're gonna cut my hours.

- Yeah. Where do you work?
- Greenhams Engineering.

- Enjoy your drink.
- Gentlemen and ladies.

- Sorry, Ada.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.641
Right.

Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

30:43.680 --> 30:45.682
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.609
Your husband believes that being seen

30:47.720 --> 30:50.007
mixing with the common people
is good politics.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.487
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism,

30:52.600 --> 30:55.763
perhaps next time, Polly, you won't
wear earrings worth more than the pub.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.724
Right. Family meeting. First item.

and a razor blade.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.850
Finn?

31:07.960 --> 31:09.086
He says they were sent to Limehouse.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.440
Chinatown.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.164
Sent by fucking who?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.406
THOMAS: Sent by me.

31:13.520 --> 31:17.127
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.290
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.

31:21.400 --> 31:25.325
I listen to you when you tell me
no more sport for anyone named Shelby.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.523
I listen to you
when you make me promises.

31:30.360 --> 31:33.330
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

31:34.440 --> 31:36.488
£50,000.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.931
In cash.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.089
He said they were sent to Chinatown
to kill somebody.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.481
That kid needs educating, Tommy,
really does.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.045
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

31:46.160 --> 31:48.845
- It was a particular opportunity.
- A particular opportunity

31:48.960 --> 31:51.804
presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.968
But you told Polly.

31:54.080 --> 31:58.369
Tommy told me there was
a pimp in East London who sold kids.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.847
THOMAS: Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hm?

32:00.960 --> 32:05.488
This pimp was blackmailing a senior member
of the House of Lords, a very wealthy man.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.365
Now this pimp is lying in a ditch,

32:08.480 --> 32:09.811
covered in flies.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.649
World's a better place.

32:11.760 --> 32:16.322
Holy fuck! So now your business
is improving the world?

32:18.040 --> 32:19.883
Sometimes, Ada...

32:21.040 --> 32:23.088
...killing is a kindness.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.531
Hm?

32:27.120 --> 32:30.044
The man we did the job for
is a High Courtjudge.

32:30.160 --> 32:34.290
We received intelligence from
a senior police officer in Scotland Yard.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.882
I've made lots of new friends in London.
Men with influence.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.288
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.165
He wasn't worth a trial.
The coppers cleared the streets for us.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.807
This was work commissioned
by a High Courtjudge, by Scotland Yard

32:47.920 --> 32:49.251
and by the House of Lords.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.840
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.486
- And it was the right thing to do.
- Fucking right.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.364
Lizzie, you need to understand.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.084
That you tell Polly, not me.

32:58.200 --> 33:03.127
You need to understand that the corridors
of Westminster are very dimly lit.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.562
And for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.081
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?

33:09.200 --> 33:11.282
<i>We? We</i> own the ropes, do we?

33:11.400 --> 33:15.041
Lizzie, Lizzie, if Finn had've listened
to me, you wouldn't have known.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.208
When we go home, I'll explain.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.562
LIZZIE: I can't be bothered
with this shit.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.925
So...

33:27.040 --> 33:31.125
...Tommy Shelby MP. Business as usual.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.168
The strategy I outlined earlier

33:34.280 --> 33:37.807
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.526
- In the meantime...
- just business as fucking usual.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.246
In the meantime,
it is fortunate that we have maintained

33:43.360 --> 33:45.727
other sources of cash income.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.322
Because until the stock market
recovers, cash is king.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.680
And cash we have.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.529
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.130
You're gonna hang yourself.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.522
Someone has to pay for them
paintings on your wall, Ada.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.005
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

34:01.120 --> 34:04.363
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.369
Polly...

34:06.480 --> 34:11.281
...when am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?

34:15.719 --> 34:19.485
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

34:19.600 --> 34:21.681
- She's pregnant.
- (SPLUTTERS)

34:23.600 --> 34:25.523
Ada's what?

34:25.639 --> 34:29.087
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.406
ARTHUR: Wait a minute.

34:30.520 --> 34:31.726
Wait a minute.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.684
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hm?

34:35.800 --> 34:40.761
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

34:40.880 --> 34:43.690
we've a lot to do, and no-one gives a fuck
who the father is.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.005
Really?

34:46.320 --> 34:48.402
I already know who the father is.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.445
But we've had enough shocks for one day.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.160
OK.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.811
All right, go on, then.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.651
How long you known about Ada, huh?

35:14.760 --> 35:15.966
I know her doctor.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.241
He calls me.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.888
Yeah, longer than me.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.081
Have a look at this.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.685
What's that funny writing on there?

35:32.800 --> 35:34.245
Chinese.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.885
Ah, right.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.686
What is it? Hmm?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.241
Bad news?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.406
Maybe.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.240
Angels of Retribution?

35:48.360 --> 35:49.486
Yeah.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.967
Burn the letter they sent.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.491
It's already done.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.525
Look at that, Tom. Hm?

36:02.680 --> 36:04.170
Pulled from our brother, eh?

36:05.840 --> 36:07.604
Finally took a first bullet.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.609
No-one fucking listens to me.

36:15.480 --> 36:16.686
Here, give it here.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.165
I'll keep it for him.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.886
- I still have my first one.
- (CHUCKLES)

36:28.480 --> 36:32.565
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.084
Where are you going, brother?

37:10.400 --> 37:13.370
MP: The huge losses
on the British Stock Exchange

37:13.480 --> 37:17.326
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

37:17.440 --> 37:22.571
I therefore must ask the trade unions
to possess understanding.

37:22.680 --> 37:26.446
The need for their flexibility
and cooperation is paramount

37:26.560 --> 37:30.610
in the coming months as we attempt
to rebuild this great nation.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.563

37:34.200 --> 37:36.009
SPEAKER: Mr Thomas Shelby.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.891
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.531
My right honourable friend,
the member for Epping,

37:44.640 --> 37:47.723
asks that following the crash,

37:47.840 --> 37:52.084
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

37:53.920 --> 37:57.242
What he's really asking
is that the working man carry the can.

37:59.480 --> 38:03.326
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

38:03.440 --> 38:08.480
when compared to the wild games of chance
being played in London and New York

38:08.600 --> 38:13.766
by gamblers in silk gloves and beaver
hats, who, when they lose their bets,

38:13.880 --> 38:16.121
turn around and ask the shoe-shine
to pay for it.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.401
(LAUGHTER)

38:17.520 --> 38:21.366
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and can carriers of South Birmingham

38:21.480 --> 38:24.927
and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest

38:25.040 --> 38:29.170
that those who so recklessly lost
their fortunes on the capitalist lottery

38:29.280 --> 38:32.648
- learn to shine their own shoes...
- (MURMURS OF ASSENT)

38:32.760 --> 38:35.843
...carry their own can
and pay their own bills.

38:35.960 --> 38:36.961
(CHEERING)

38:43.840 --> 38:44.841
Mr Shelby?

38:46.200 --> 38:49.124
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.730
You speak very eloquently.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.569
Thank you.

38:52.680 --> 38:57.163
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.247
Yeah, I know who you are.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.647
My constituency borders yours.

39:00.760 --> 39:04.128
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.083
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come.

39:13.480 --> 39:14.481
Ah.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.642
I have bad news, Mr...

39:22.520 --> 39:23.521
Shelby.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.441
We agreed 50,000
on completion of business.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.565
My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.762
There's 2O there.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.723
You'll have to wait for the rest.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.001
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

39:49.400 --> 39:50.606
Cavalry, eh?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.529
Mm.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.687
Huh!

39:54.920 --> 39:56.001
Yeah.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.561
I spent a long of time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

40:01.960 --> 40:06.761
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.451
When the cavalry finally came,

40:09.560 --> 40:13.201
an officer,
on the back of a fine white horse,

40:13.320 --> 40:18.087
joked that he'd been delayed
playing a game of whist.

40:19.160 --> 40:23.085
So I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.965
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.611
All for a game of chance.

40:31.280 --> 40:34.727
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

40:34.840 --> 40:38.526
they collected all the photographs,
letters and cheques

40:38.640 --> 40:40.722
that will cause you concern.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.002
I now have them in a safe place.

40:43.120 --> 40:48.889
On Monday, you will give me
the full £50,000 in cash...

40:50.040 --> 40:52.691
...or I will steal your white horse
from under you.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.609
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

40:58.720 --> 41:01.291
in a place of power and privilege?

41:01.400 --> 41:02.845
A man like me?

41:07.600 --> 41:08.601
A man like me?

41:10.120 --> 41:11.884
Lord Suckerby.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.411
I've seen the photographs.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.081
Monday.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.490
(SHOUTS) Shelby!

41:26.800 --> 41:28.450
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.245
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

41:31.360 --> 41:34.648
The police are concerned about the effect
of the crash in industrial areas.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.001
- Right.
- Everything all right?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.645
Yeah, fine.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.081
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.207
Your brother been busy?

41:44.160 --> 41:47.642
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

41:47.760 --> 41:49.762
the former Communist MP
for Battersea.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.486
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall -

41:52.600 --> 41:53.726
he's setting up a meeting -

41:53.840 --> 41:57.811
and there's talk of a mass walk-out
of bus drivers, Nottingham and Derby,

41:57.920 --> 42:02.562
organised by two Communist convenors
not formerly known to Special Branch.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.604
He's also had a telephone conversation
with Jessie Eden,

42:05.720 --> 42:09.247
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.761
But he'll report more when he sees her.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.006
It's all in there, though.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.565
Names and everything.

42:14.680 --> 42:17.331
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

42:17.440 --> 42:21.001
Huh. If only he meant it,
he'd be dangerous.

42:21.120 --> 42:24.363
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.482
Times are hard.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.008
Hm.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.127
Exactly how much did you lose?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.766
Don't worry about it. Tommy has a plan.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.930
He thinks that we can turn the collapse
of the stock exchange to our advantage.

42:42.040 --> 42:45.487
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

42:45.600 --> 42:48.922
He says, "We can wave cash in the faces
of desperate men."

42:50.920 --> 42:53.446
Tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

42:53.560 --> 42:57.849
I'm told two more military contracts
for vehicles

42:57.960 --> 43:00.964
and parts for the Army in India
are on their way to him.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.530
(EXHALES)

43:17.640 --> 43:18.641
Fuck.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.485
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.126
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.

43:29.240 --> 43:30.890
It's from Winston Churchill.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.569
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin

43:35.680 --> 43:37.887
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.844
So he was in New York
and he doesn't mention the crash.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.361
No. Even though, in the bar last night,

43:43.480 --> 43:48.361
Mr Churchill's private secretary
reckoned he lost £75,000 in two hours.

43:50.600 --> 43:51.601
And you?

43:53.240 --> 43:56.210
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

43:56.320 --> 43:58.607
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.642
You lock up.

43:59.760 --> 44:03.731
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you...
you have one more appointment.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.241
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

44:06.360 --> 44:07.850
<i>A journalist from the Times.</i>

44:07.960 --> 44:09.724
<i>He used to</i> be with
<i>the Birmingham Mail.</i>

44:09.840 --> 44:11.604
He sent you some questions.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.563
You said you wanted to meet him.

44:13.680 --> 44:14.681
He's outside.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.761
Yes.

44:17.880 --> 44:18.961
Send him in.

44:23.240 --> 44:27.450
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the London <i>Times.</i>

44:27.560 --> 44:29.289
Have a seat.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.402
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.487
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

44:42.600 --> 44:44.250
No.

44:44.360 --> 44:49.161
Once, in Small Heath,
you were burning photographs of the King.

44:49.280 --> 44:55.401
- London <i>Times.</i> You've done well.
- As have you, sir, to put it mildly.

44:55.520 --> 44:57.648
I sent you a list of questions.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.842
Yeah, I misplaced them.

45:01.040 --> 45:02.963
Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.286
Yes.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.210
All I remember is
that your questions interested me.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.084
Oh!

45:09.200 --> 45:10.486
Good.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.449
Sorry, just...

45:13.560 --> 45:15.164
Ah, here we are.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.730
Yes, um... (CLEARS THROAT)

45:19.480 --> 45:24.850
Um... So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

45:24.960 --> 45:29.761
printjournalists take no interest in the,
er, the private lives of politicians.

45:29.880 --> 45:31.848
Private lives?

45:31.960 --> 45:36.045
But in these modern times,
especially in America...

45:36.160 --> 45:40.927
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...

45:41.040 --> 45:42.929
Readers are beginning to say...

45:43.960 --> 45:47.203
...want to know more about the men
who represent them.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.606
Of course.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.643
In these modern times.

45:51.720 --> 45:55.008
Whereas before it would have
been seen as ungentlemanly to, er,

45:55.120 --> 45:58.920
to ask a public figure questions
about personal matters

45:59.040 --> 46:01.930
- or business affairs.
- Oh, well. No need to worry.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.565
I'm no gentleman.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.521
Hm.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.884
Er, Mr Shelby,
as I said in my letter,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.731
<i>ten</i> years <i>ago</i> I <i>was a journalist
on the Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>

46:16.920 --> 46:19.082
And of course, working in that city,

46:19.200 --> 46:22.010
it was impossible
not to know your name...

46:23.640 --> 46:26.086
...and your reputation.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.844
(EXHALES) So, when I saw that you had
been elected as a socialist...

46:31.960 --> 46:33.291
You reflected on the fact

46:33.400 --> 46:39.089
that working people can indeed change
their lives for the better...

46:40.400 --> 46:44.724
...channel their abilities in new
directions, discover better methods,

46:44.840 --> 46:50.210
aim for happier outcomes,
even win awards for industry.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.084
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

46:52.200 --> 46:55.602
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

46:57.160 --> 47:02.041
Was your conversion from bookmaker
to socialist politician

47:02.160 --> 47:05.050
a gradual thing or...

47:06.400 --> 47:09.961
...a road to Damascus experience?

47:11.040 --> 47:12.724
Yeah.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.729
Now I hear that question...

47:16.640 --> 47:18.244
...I remember receiving your letters

47:18.360 --> 47:21.523
and I distinctly remember your use
of the word "bookmaker".

47:22.880 --> 47:26.043
- Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
- Yes.

47:26.160 --> 47:30.449
I gained a license
in 1919 for on-track betting.

47:30.560 --> 47:31.800
But, since 1923,

47:31.920 --> 47:35.367
I've made my fortune in the manufacture,
sale and export of motor cars.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.925
And lately gin.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.522
And lately three new homes
for orphaned children.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.251
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.171
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

47:49.280 --> 47:53.763
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there,

47:53.880 --> 47:56.121
there was a Major Campbell.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.646
He was found dead.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.722
A member of your family was charged.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.006
(CHUCKLES)

48:11.040 --> 48:13.884
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

48:16.320 --> 48:19.881
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.526
Is it evolution or revolution?

48:22.640 --> 48:26.167
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

48:26.280 --> 48:29.648
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart,

48:29.760 --> 48:34.766
what is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

48:34.880 --> 48:37.121
I am talking about specific events, sir.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.241
Which I don't recall...

48:39.680 --> 48:42.365
...with which I was never
personally linked,

48:42.480 --> 48:45.962
and after which
all convictions were quashed.

48:52.440 --> 48:57.446
Yeah, now...
I recall receiving your letter...

48:58.920 --> 49:00.888
...and I recall that when I did...

49:02.400 --> 49:06.724
...I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

49:09.560 --> 49:10.641
Just a moment.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.725
Here we are. (EXHALES)

49:27.240 --> 49:29.846
Ah, Michael Levitt.

49:29.960 --> 49:30.961
Correct?

49:32.240 --> 49:34.368
- Yes.
- Yes.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.925
Journalist.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.042
Unmarried.

49:38.160 --> 49:40.003
An apartment in Maida Vale.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.527
An apartment opposite
the underground station.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.370
"Unmarried" is underlined.

49:49.480 --> 49:52.563
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

49:52.680 --> 49:54.205
Sometimes alone.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.368
Sometimes not alone.

49:57.920 --> 50:00.161
Sometimes with other men.

50:05.960 --> 50:10.204
Sometimes with other men.

50:12.960 --> 50:16.681
I'm old-fashioned...Michael.

50:17.720 --> 50:20.326
I believe private lives
should remain private.

50:21.560 --> 50:24.006
Not everything modern is good, now, is it?

50:28.360 --> 50:29.646
You gonna write this down...

50:31.240 --> 50:33.208
...in your little fucking book?

50:41.240 --> 50:42.810
Well?

50:42.920 --> 50:44.729
Not yet.

50:44.840 --> 50:46.524
I didn't tell him.

50:46.640 --> 50:49.928
Him knowing or not knowing
has no relevance to what we're drinking.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.487
It's vintage.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.129
- Fuck it.
- (CHUCKLES)

50:57.240 --> 50:58.571
This...

51:00.280 --> 51:01.520
...is for us.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.404
Let's drink to the baby.

51:08.080 --> 51:10.208
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

51:12.560 --> 51:14.688
You were going to take me to Cardiff.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.768
I was going to get rid of it.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.046
What about this time?

51:22.640 --> 51:23.846
Imagine.

51:26.360 --> 51:28.124
The father's scared.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.924
He runs away.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.201
You're left.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.482
Oh, sweetheart.

51:35.600 --> 51:40.811
The baby's black,
he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.

51:42.440 --> 51:43.771
But you don't care.

51:44.880 --> 51:47.281
Because the world has changed.

51:48.720 --> 51:51.041
And the baby's eyes are golden.

51:51.160 --> 51:55.848
And you're gonna leave her with
Aunt Polly every day to look after.

51:55.960 --> 51:59.203
Aunt Polly, who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.402
How do you know it's a her?

52:01.520 --> 52:04.569
Cos I'm Polly Gray.

52:04.680 --> 52:06.444
It's a girl?

52:06.560 --> 52:07.561
Golden.

52:08.760 --> 52:12.048
To be born in the year 1930,

52:12.160 --> 52:14.891
where everything will be changed
for the better.

52:16.640 --> 52:19.530
She'll be the colour of a Hollywood Oscar.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.205
What will Tommy say?

52:27.440 --> 52:29.090
Tommy knows.

52:32.440 --> 52:33.771
Hmm!

52:33.880 --> 52:38.602
He's also seen that the world's
big and round and he says, "So what?"

52:43.600 --> 52:45.728
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

52:47.160 --> 52:49.561
We are flying above the rules now.

52:52.520 --> 52:54.966
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

52:56.600 --> 52:57.886
That's the beauty.

53:12.320 --> 53:13.321
Hello, Cyril.

53:15.120 --> 53:17.043
Least you're still talking to me.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.081
Where is everyone?

53:28.200 --> 53:30.043
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

53:33.520 --> 53:39.846
You know, Frances, if there were to be
a snap election in this house today...

53:41.440 --> 53:42.726
...wouldn't win it...

53:43.760 --> 53:46.604
...not even if I were running
against the devil himself.

53:46.720 --> 53:47.721
No.

53:48.760 --> 53:49.966
- I gathered.
- Mm.

53:51.680 --> 53:53.284
Where's Charles?

53:53.400 --> 53:54.640
Charles is in the stable.

53:56.760 --> 53:58.091
Thank you.

54:15.080 --> 54:16.491
(CLEARS THROAT)

54:18.000 --> 54:19.445
Did Arthur explain?

54:19.560 --> 54:21.403
He said it's God's will.

54:23.320 --> 54:24.890
But you're not God!

54:35.520 --> 54:37.761
(SIGHS) No, I'm not God.

54:42.720 --> 54:43.846
Not yet.
