03:55.000 --> 03:56.208
- What's up, baby boy?

03:56.916 --> 03:58.333
What's up, mama?

03:59.833 --> 04:02.708
Whoa!
What are you doing?

04:02.708 --> 04:06.125
- Washing my hands.
- His mama got locked up.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.166
- What? For what?

04:07.166 --> 04:09.333
- An old warrant
or some bullshit.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.333
I don't know, but you
need to go bail her.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.666
- Why can't she just
thug it out?

04:13.666 --> 04:16.000
- Because I got work.
I can't watch him.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.541
- Well, who said you
have to watch him?

04:17.541 --> 04:19.875
- Well, I know you ain't gonna
watch him, so...

04:20.500 --> 04:22.625
- How much is it?
400.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.166
- Ah, shit.
What the fuck?

04:24.166 --> 04:25.708
How the fuck am I
gonna get that?

04:25.708 --> 04:27.875
- I don't fucking know where
you're gonna get $400.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.375
Ask her aunties.
- Mom, her aunties

04:29.375 --> 04:30.875
don't even like me.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.291
I ain't got time for this.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.708
- You don't have time
for what shit?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.625
Your baby mama? Or me?

04:59.625 --> 05:01.708
- Oh, you got a collar, huh?

05:12.166 --> 05:13.416
Yo.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.541
I have your dog.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.375
Yeah, where you live at?

05:23.625 --> 05:26.041
Like the first one
or the second one?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.958
Alright. Well, I'll be by
in like a couple minutes
or something.

05:38.208 --> 05:39.416
Alright.

05:45.583 --> 05:47.625
Yo, you guys wanna buy a PS4?

05:47.625 --> 05:49.041
No.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.291
- Come on.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.166
Come on.

05:57.416 --> 05:59.250
Here you go. Come on.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.375
- What kind of dog is it?
- I don't even know.

06:01.375 --> 06:02.958
She was just outside
of my house.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.583
She's pretty cool, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.500
- You wanna buy her?
- No.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.958
Come on.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.666
- Hey, you good?

06:56.708 --> 06:59.250
- Man, nah, I'm fucking
confused, bro.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.958
- Fuck, bro, it's hot outside.

07:12.541 --> 07:14.583
- Hotter than Germ's
math teacher.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
Oh, score.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.708
- Yeah.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.625
He's flexing the burrito.

07:20.625 --> 07:22.416
- It's a bologna sandwich.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.416
Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks
for this couch.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.583
- I know he got some blaze.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.500
- Hey, Donny,
don't look at these.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.708
- Holy cow.

07:33.708 --> 07:35.875
Holy fuck, these are
pretty nice, bro.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.791
- Hey, don't fuck with that.
My dad will fuck you up, man.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.625
- Alright, after I look
I'll return it.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.166
- Geez!
- What?

07:44.166 --> 07:45.833
- Holy shit!
What is this?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.791
I knew he had something.

07:47.791 --> 07:49.083
What is this?
- Let me see.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.291
Let me check it out.

07:51.291 --> 07:53.500
- Fuck you.
- Yo, we can smoke that.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.750
Bro, let's smoke it then.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.666
- Fuck that.
- Why?

07:59.916 --> 08:01.750
- My dad will fuck me up.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.708
- Bruh.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.166
- Shit's bunk.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.083
- Did you experience it?

08:08.625 --> 08:10.541
- Bro... It's meth.

08:12.541 --> 08:14.125
- Meth is the best.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.583
- I'm about it,
walking around like that.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.208
- Like you tried it.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.666
- Like you ever tried it?

08:23.250 --> 08:26.041
- Well, I did.
- Oh. My. Gosh.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.166
But I did.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.375
- Geez.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.000
- And it tastes like shit.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.500
Bro, it burns the back
of your throat so much

08:33.500 --> 08:34.875
it makes you skinny.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.500
It makes you throw up
all your food.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.832
You stay up for like, 14 days.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.666
Bro, one single fucking hit.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.625
- One hit, you're addicted.
- Fucker.

08:49.208 --> 08:50.458
- Boy, you're like, 10.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.416
You can't have
tried it back then.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.166
- Chicken wing, no way.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.875
- Let me see then.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.125
You being a bitch, bro.
Just let me see.

09:04.166 --> 09:07.541
- Bro, you're gonna end up
bony as fuck.

09:09.833 --> 09:11.333
Let's sell it.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.916
- Yo, who is it?

09:16.916 --> 09:19.291
- I was talking to somebody
about returning a dog.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.125
- Oh, yeah. She's mine.
Let me see.

09:26.541 --> 09:27.583
Come on.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.541
So, what's good?

09:33.541 --> 09:35.000
- Not much.
You got a return fee?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.958
- For what?
- Well, we were just thinking,

09:36.958 --> 09:38.250
since we brought it back,

09:38.250 --> 09:39.750
you could hook it up
with a little something.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.250
- Can't be giving out
hand-outs, bro.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.041
That's bad for business.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.416
But if you want to buy her,

09:44.416 --> 09:46.708
I could cut you in
because you found her.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.500
She's expensive though.
- Fuck.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.583
How much is she?
- A rack.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.750
Sometimes two.
Just depends.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.458
- Fuck, a rack for that?
- Fuck yeah. Shit.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.875
If you breed her,
the puppies go for like,
a rack or two each.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.625
- Holy fuck, man.

09:58.625 --> 10:00.750
- Yo, so I'm gonna make
some tea. Do you guys want any?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.500
- No, I'm good.
- No, we're straight.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.125
But I just think it's fucked up
that we did a good deed

10:05.125 --> 10:08.083
when we didn't have to, and
we can't get no deal or nothing.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.750
We could've just
ran off with it.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.833
- Could cut you a deal for 990

10:11.833 --> 10:13.416
for your little good
deed or whatever.

10:13.416 --> 10:15.541
- What the fuck? 990? Ain't that
some cheap-skating ass shit?

10:15.541 --> 10:16.833
You're only taking
10 bucks off of that.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.291
You fucking serious?
- I mean, you're the one

10:18.291 --> 10:19.750
fucking coming at me
with a deal.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.166
I'm giving you one, bro.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.208
- First of all, we ain't come
and ask for a deal.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.250
We're coming because
we're bringing your dog back.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.250
And second of all,
when do I need the money by?

10:28.250 --> 10:29.875
Shit.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.958
Could be tonight.
Could be tomorrow.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.833
ASAP.

10:36.791 --> 10:38.416
- Hurry up, you fucking...

10:38.416 --> 10:39.958
- His donkey looks retarded.

10:39.958 --> 10:42.208
- We got some meth, bro.
You want some?

10:42.208 --> 10:43.625
- Shut the fuck up.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.125
- That donkey's straight up
dementia or something.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.333
Fuck.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.125
- Yo, why are you calling
me out like that?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.666
- 'Cuz, bro, we got some shit
and we need to get rid of it.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.583
- How much?
- How much do you want?

10:53.583 --> 10:55.500
- Probably just a dub right now.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.375
- 100 bucks, bro.
- 100 bucks for

10:58.375 --> 11:00.791
a fucking dub, man?
What the fuck, man?

11:00.791 --> 11:02.625
That shit's outrageous, bro.
- All right. 60 bucks.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.625
- 60 bucks is still
too much, man.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.875
What the fuck? You think
I'm a bank or something?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.750
I'll give you $20
for two dubs, man.
That's a deal.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.333
- Okay wait, hold up.
You got any hoots?

11:10.333 --> 11:11.625
- Shit, yeah.
I got a couple.

11:11.625 --> 11:12.916
- Well, I'll tell you this.

11:12.916 --> 11:14.666
We'll take 40 and the hoots.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.625
- Shit, all I got is
20 on me right now.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.083
- Alright, bro, that'll work.
Give it to him.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.833
- Shit, y'all are crazy.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.166
Alright, for sure, boys.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.500
- Pleasure doing business
with you and your donkey.

11:36.958 --> 11:40.875
- Yeah, papered,
but we have to pay tomorrow.

11:42.166 --> 11:43.541
- What's he getting
a poodle for?

11:43.541 --> 11:44.708
- Puppy soup.
- No shit?

11:44.708 --> 11:46.625
- Alright, then.
Well, hit me back.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.333
- Bro, what you getting
a poodle for?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.833
- Bro, because when I breed her,
that's like 10 G's per litter.

11:50.833 --> 11:52.416
- Shit. How much?

11:52.416 --> 11:54.375
- She's a rack, but I got
a good deal for her.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.375
- I know, but how much
for the one you're getting?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.250
- I just said that.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.916
- She's a rack,
but I got a good deal.

11:59.916 --> 12:01.500
Damn, a rack for a poodle?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.708
- Yeah.
- I've been saying, man.

12:02.708 --> 12:04.125
Fuck, we should have just
stole that thing.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.500
Shit.
- Yeah.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.875
Bro, that's fucking crazy shit.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.583
- Shit, who are you gonna
breed it with?

12:08.583 --> 12:09.708
- Hello?

12:09.708 --> 12:11.291
- Who's he gonna
breed it with, bro?

12:11.291 --> 12:13.166
- I don't know, man,
but it don't make no sense.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.625
- Yeah, if you want
to split the litter,
you gotta come in on half.

12:15.625 --> 12:18.041
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to Tiberius, man.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.000
Chill out.
- Man, fuck that motherfucker.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.625
- Is it one of those
little poodles?

12:21.625 --> 12:23.541
- No, it's a legit poodle, bro.

12:23.541 --> 12:26.208
- Yeah, bro. Uh...
If we get the brindled ones,

12:26.208 --> 12:27.916
it's 4 K a dog.

12:27.916 --> 12:29.416
- Bro, tell him I said
fuck him, bro.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.875
If I see him,
I'm gonna fuck him up

12:30.875 --> 12:32.250
and I'm gonna take his dog.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.833
- Bro, you need
to calm down, alright?

12:33.833 --> 12:36.083
This is business.
Plus, he don't have the dog.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.500
See, this is the point.
I'm trying to have him
buy the dog with me.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.166
- I could care a less, bro.
Still, fuck him.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.916
Tell him I said that shit too.
- Shit.

12:41.916 --> 12:43.583
<i>- Hello?</i><i>
Who are you talking about?</i>

12:43.583 --> 12:45.916
- Huh? No, man. We ain't
fucking talking about you.

12:45.916 --> 12:47.708
- We are fucking talking
about you.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.041
Man, shut up.

12:49.041 --> 12:50.625
Hey, but I'll talk
to you later, alright?

12:50.625 --> 12:52.916
- Tiberius? What kind
of fucking name is that anyway?

12:52.916 --> 12:55.000
Did he call Popcorn?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.500
- Shit.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.833
- Yeah, bro.
But remember Popcorn

12:57.833 --> 12:59.416
is breeding with
Sissy Sanchez now.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.375
- Pop this bitch...

13:42.083 --> 13:45.291
- Hey, bro.
This ain't enough.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.208
- I got you.
- Alright, thank you, Auntie.

13:47.208 --> 13:48.500
- I got him.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.500
- Hey, are you guys hiring?
- We are not.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.666
- No?

14:03.500 --> 14:04.791
Echo!

14:05.416 --> 14:07.208
Echo!
- What?

14:07.208 --> 14:09.333
- Is that my baby
or did you have another one?

14:10.791 --> 14:12.541
Echo!
- What do you want?

14:12.541 --> 14:14.916
- You. Where you been at?

14:14.916 --> 14:16.833
- Home.
- Oh.

14:18.916 --> 14:21.208
It's like that?
- What do you want?

14:21.958 --> 14:23.208
- I got you this.

14:23.708 --> 14:25.250
- I gotta go.
- Why?

14:25.250 --> 14:27.041
- Because I don't want
to talk to you right now.

14:27.041 --> 14:28.708
- Why?
- Because I'm mad at you.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.083
- Since when?

14:31.083 --> 14:32.458
- Since you stole my fucking car

14:32.458 --> 14:33.833
and missed your son's baptism.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.333
Took that hoe on a run
to Denver

14:35.333 --> 14:37.166
when I told you my car
didn't have tags.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.875
- Shit.
- Yep.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.666
- But like, you don't even
know me anymore.

14:41.666 --> 14:43.333
I'm a changed man.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.791
I'm about to be rich as fuck
with a million poodles.

14:45.791 --> 14:47.916
- I gotta go.
- Ah.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.541
- Fuck.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.000
- Man, Germ, you're stinking

15:21.000 --> 15:22.875
like some fucking ass
or something.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.375
- You haven't showered
in four weeks.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.625
- Chee four.

15:28.625 --> 15:32.166
- If you laugh, you're in
love with Lil' Marty.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.875
Alright, alright.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.250
- Nay, this guy laughed.
- Starting now.

15:45.916 --> 15:47.375
- Fucker's out.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.208
- Hi.

15:56.666 --> 15:58.583
- Stealing from your
own dad now, huh?

16:02.875 --> 16:04.083
Hello?

16:05.875 --> 16:07.000
- No.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.208
- Who the fuck ate
my sandwich then?

16:12.500 --> 16:13.708
- I did.

16:14.416 --> 16:16.541
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

16:24.166 --> 16:27.291
- I need the bed tonight.
- Okay.

17:05.375 --> 17:09.458
- Alright, I got wheels, rims,

17:09.458 --> 17:12.415
catalytic converters,
batteries, gas.

17:12.415 --> 17:14.583
Oh, and a GPS system.

17:14.583 --> 17:17.040
- I can do $250 for everything
but the gas.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.208
I don't buy gas anymore.
- Fuck, would you be able

17:19.208 --> 17:22.833
to do at least $400 or $350?
- No, it's the end of the month.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.833
You'll have to wait
till next Thursday

17:24.833 --> 17:27.083
when the boss gets back if you
want him to take another look.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.000
- To be honest, I'm just
trying to buy this dog.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.666
- What's the best you
can do today?

17:30.666 --> 17:32.458
- It's $250, man.

17:32.458 --> 17:33.583
- Fuck.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.041
- I'll take that rice cooker
for $20, though.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.291
- $20? Alright then.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.833
But I gotta sell it with
the dishwashing gloves.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.916
It's like a two-for-one deal.

17:42.916 --> 17:45.041
- Well, how about $22 for both?

17:45.958 --> 17:47.583
- Yeah. That sounds good.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.541
- Bro, you know anybody
looking for any PS4's?

17:51.541 --> 17:53.375
- No, we don't buy PS4's, bro.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.125
You might have to try
Prairie's Edge.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.958
- Fuck, alright.

18:05.666 --> 18:08.208
- 100 equals 10
to the second power.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.958
10 times 10.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.541
1,000 equals 10
to the third power.

18:12.541 --> 18:17.708
10 times 10 times 10 times
10 times 10 times 10,

18:17.708 --> 18:20.000
and so on through the series.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.666
Now, we can do it with
another number like 2

18:22.666 --> 18:24.708
which is pretty straightforward.

18:24.708 --> 18:27.791
Two to the first power
equals itself. Two.

18:27.791 --> 18:30.125
Two to the second power
equals four.

18:30.125 --> 18:33.166
Now... following that pattern,

18:33.166 --> 18:35.666
what would be the next number
in this series?

18:35.666 --> 18:38.833
- Two to the fifth power?
- Good.

18:38.833 --> 18:41.083
- Two to the fifth power.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.416
And the answer to that
would be what?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.000
- 20?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.041
- It would be two times two

18:49.041 --> 18:52.958
times two times
two times two is eight.

18:52.958 --> 18:54.500
Two times eight is 16.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.000
Two times 16 is 32.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.250
So, this is all the material
that you're gonna need to know

19:00.250 --> 19:02.291
for your quiz on Thursday.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.833
Those of you that don't have
your notebooks and pencils out,

19:04.833 --> 19:07.625
you probably want to get them
out and get these down.

19:07.625 --> 19:11.166
Any questions on this so far?
Does this make sense?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.541
Thursday's quiz is going
to cover exponents.

19:15.916 --> 19:17.875
So, see you tomorrow.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.458
<i>- This is a prepaid</i><i>
call from...</i>

19:38.458 --> 19:40.000
<i>- Carly.</i>

19:40.000 --> 19:43.083
<i>- ...an inmate at the County</i><i>
Correctional Facility.</i>

19:43.083 --> 19:45.583
<i>To decline this call,</i><i>
press nine now,</i>

19:45.583 --> 19:47.083

Your call has been accepted.</i>

19:48.875 --> 19:50.125
- Hello?

19:50.125 --> 19:52.000
<i>- What are you doing?</i><i>
Come bail me.</i>

19:52.000 --> 19:54.333
- What the fuck
you talking about? How?
I don't even have no money.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.500
<i>- I don't know, Bill.</i><i>
Figure it out.</i>

19:57.000 --> 19:58.958
<i>It's fucking cold in here.</i>
- Well, then what the fuck

19:58.958 --> 20:00.708
did you do to get there
in the first place?

20:00.708 --> 20:02.875
<i>- For a traffic violation, Bill.</i><i>
I don't know.</i>

20:02.875 --> 20:04.958
<i>Is my son okay?</i>

20:04.958 --> 20:07.958
- Duh, what you think? <i>
- Well, where is he?</i>

20:07.958 --> 20:10.250
- With my mom. <i>
- You have 30 seconds left.</i>

20:10.250 --> 20:13.541
<i>- Well, man the fuck up</i><i>
and bail me right now, Bill.</i><i>
I'm not fucking playing.</i>

20:13.541 --> 20:15.833
- How about you fucking call
the homeboy that you've been

20:15.833 --> 20:18.041
messaging and have him
come bail you?

20:18.041 --> 20:20.416
<i>- Oh, you mean homeboy</i><i>
who looks after your son</i>

20:20.416 --> 20:21.875
<i>because you're too busy</i><i>
rattling off</i>

20:21.875 --> 20:23.666
<i>with your new family to be</i><i>
a fucking dad to him?</i>

20:23.666 --> 20:25.083
<i>You rat off all</i><i>
the fucking time.</i>

20:25.083 --> 20:26.458
- You know what?
Girl, I rat around

20:26.458 --> 20:28.125
because I don't even know
where we stand, alright?

20:28.125 --> 20:29.916
And I ain't got time for this. <i>
- ...bail me out</i>

20:29.916 --> 20:31.541
<i>so I can take care</i><i>
of my own goddamn--</i>

20:39.000 --> 20:40.208
- Hello?

20:40.208 --> 20:41.916
<i>- Hey, man.</i><i>
What you selling?</i>

20:41.916 --> 20:44.583
- What up, bro?
It's a poodle with papers.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.291
<i>- Why the fuck you buying</i><i>
a poodle, man?</i>

20:46.291 --> 20:48.541
- Nah, I'm gonna breed her, but
I gotta pay this girl tomorrow.

20:48.541 --> 20:50.375
<i>- Well, how much then?</i>
- Hey, I'm gonna have

20:50.375 --> 20:52.166
to call you back. Alright? <i>
- No problem.</i>

21:10.750 --> 21:12.708
- What's up, man?
- Howdy.

21:12.708 --> 21:13.791
- You need some help?

21:13.791 --> 21:15.666
- Yeah, my front tire's
blown out.

21:15.666 --> 21:18.333
- Damn. Well,
you got any cash on you?

21:18.333 --> 21:20.541
I could help you like,
take you to Rush or something.

21:20.541 --> 21:22.708
- I was hoping maybe
you'd take me up to my house

21:22.708 --> 21:24.750
and I'll have my boys
come back for the truck.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.958
- Well, where do you live?
- About two miles out

21:26.958 --> 21:28.541
of Scottsbluff.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.250
- Ooh.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.166
Hmm.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.375
That's gonna have to cost you.
- Yeah?

21:36.375 --> 21:38.791
How much?
- Shit.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.166
Scottsbluff is pretty far.

21:42.166 --> 21:45.708
Plus, I need some gas.
I'd say at least like, $80.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.750
- All right.
That'll work.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.458
- Alright. Well, hop in.
- Alrighty.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.958
- What's up, Dad?
- What's up, little man?

22:07.958 --> 22:10.291
- Nothing.
- How was school?

22:10.291 --> 22:11.333
- Good.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.416
- Tight. Tight.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.083
- Well, you wanna play
some video games?

22:16.083 --> 22:17.875
- Nah, I gotta work.

22:17.875 --> 22:19.625
- Why, you still got
that one job?

22:19.625 --> 22:21.666
- No, those fuckers fired me
over some dumb shit.

22:23.791 --> 22:26.375
- I'm going to get a job soon.
- Oh, yeah?

22:26.375 --> 22:29.708
- Yeah. So I can get a phone
and talk to my girl.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.541
- You ain't got no girl.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.291
You wanna hit it?

22:40.833 --> 22:42.375
I know you smoke.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.416
Alright, Snoop.

22:59.416 --> 23:01.250
Give me that back now.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.291
That's what you get.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.708
- I got a hot lunch for you.

23:11.833 --> 23:14.958
- You ate already?
- Yeah, I ate.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.458
- What'd you eat?

23:18.416 --> 23:20.416
- Oh, shit. My bad.

23:20.416 --> 23:23.500
That was last night,
but I'm not even hungry.

23:24.666 --> 23:25.875
- Alright.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.916
What's that?
- A book to learn magic.

23:31.916 --> 23:33.833
- Show me a magic trick.

23:33.833 --> 23:35.666
- What kind of magic?

23:35.666 --> 23:38.625
- I don't know.
Show me a card trick, something.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.041
- I don't like card tricks.

23:40.041 --> 23:41.166
- Why not?

23:41.916 --> 23:44.625
- 'Cause it's not real magic.
- What's real magic?

23:44.625 --> 23:47.291
- Like when you can change
things with your mind.

23:48.291 --> 23:49.791
- I'll show you a magic trick.

23:49.791 --> 23:51.416
I'll make this food disappear.

23:51.416 --> 23:54.125
Alright, man. I'm out.

23:54.125 --> 23:56.000
- Alright. I'll be in in a bit.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.208
- Alright.

24:22.541 --> 24:24.458
- You can just pull over here.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.708
Wait here for a second.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.333
Say, Bill.

24:54.958 --> 24:56.958
How'd you like
to make another $100?

24:56.958 --> 24:58.500
- Shit, how so?

24:58.500 --> 25:01.083
- The thing is I'm supposed
to have dinner with my wife

25:01.083 --> 25:03.125
and I was hoping that
you'd do me a favor

25:03.125 --> 25:06.500
and head out to the truck
and swap out that tire for me.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.958
- Hmm.

25:11.541 --> 25:13.500
Is it all yours?

25:14.250 --> 25:16.500
- Yep. It's all mine.
- Hmm.

25:17.791 --> 25:20.791
I could do it for $200.
- Okay.

25:22.833 --> 25:24.500
Here's the thing, Bill.

25:25.708 --> 25:28.291
The important thing
here is that...

25:28.291 --> 25:30.333
I got a girl out in that truck.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.208
- Ooh.

25:32.208 --> 25:35.291
And I'm going to need you
to give her a ride home.

25:35.291 --> 25:36.666
Could you do that for me?

25:37.333 --> 25:39.041
- Sure. Where does she stay?

25:39.041 --> 25:40.791
- I don't know.
You'll have to ask her.

25:40.791 --> 25:42.250
Somewhere on the rez, I think.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.041
- Oh, shit.

25:45.291 --> 25:48.291
Shit, I mean that's like
a couple hours to go pick her up

25:48.291 --> 25:50.625
and an hour back to Ridge,

25:50.625 --> 25:52.958
plus I don't even know
where she'll be staying.

25:52.958 --> 25:55.250
I'm gonna need a little
bit more than $200.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.875
- How much more?
- $400.

25:56.875 --> 25:58.500
- $400?
- And a job.

25:58.500 --> 25:59.833
- And a job?

26:01.208 --> 26:03.500
What makes you think
I got a job for you?

26:03.500 --> 26:05.125
- I mean...

26:05.125 --> 26:09.041
You got two big houses,
big 'ol land.

26:10.916 --> 26:12.291
You must be doing
something right.

26:12.291 --> 26:13.583
- Uh-huh.

26:14.458 --> 26:17.916
I'll tell you what.
I'm not gonna give you $400,

26:17.916 --> 26:20.708
but we can see about the job.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.041
What do you think?

26:22.041 --> 26:24.875
- Yeah, well,
I appreciate all that,

26:24.875 --> 26:27.375
but I gotta go get my son
to the dentist.

26:27.375 --> 26:28.750
I'm gonna have to pass.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:30.291 --> 26:31.916
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

26:33.541 --> 26:36.125
I'll do $300...

26:36.125 --> 26:39.416
and you might be in luck
with the job, yeah.

26:40.375 --> 26:42.750
- Yeah. Yeah.
I could do that.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.333
Throw it in the trunk.
- Alrighty.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.250
- Check this out.

26:54.291 --> 26:55.625
- That's pretty cool.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.208
- I waited six fucking months

26:57.208 --> 26:58.541
for this little bastard, man.

27:00.958 --> 27:03.125
They sent it
to two or three P.O. boxes

27:03.125 --> 27:04.708
before they finally got us.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.708
I spaced them out.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.083
Yeah.

27:12.541 --> 27:14.333
Alright, little man.
See you later.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.166
Alright. See you, Dad.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.791
- Yeah.

27:43.041 --> 27:44.625
- Fuck!
- What are you doing, bro?

27:45.583 --> 27:48.125
- Don't come barging in
like that next time.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.666
- My bad.
- Fuck this guy.

27:49.666 --> 27:52.666
Scared you shitless?

27:52.666 --> 27:54.041
Or shirtless?

27:55.250 --> 27:57.166
- Here you go, bro.
Check it out.

27:57.166 --> 28:00.833
This here, my boy,
is Epsom salt.

28:00.833 --> 28:03.458
- Ha, I ain't your fuckin' son.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.083
- You good?
- Yeah.

28:20.083 --> 28:22.083
- I'm Bill.
I'm taking you home.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.000
Go ahead.
You can just get in.

28:44.291 --> 28:45.583
- Look at these little guys.

28:45.583 --> 28:47.333
- Fucking mutts,
forget about it.

28:47.333 --> 28:48.208
- Who's looking?

28:48.750 --> 28:50.500
- Who's all looking?

28:50.500 --> 28:52.208
- Is this shit good, or what?

28:52.208 --> 28:54.416
- It's good stuff, bro.
- Yeah, it's legit.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.833
- Who's your dad?

28:56.833 --> 28:58.458
Arnie Whitehorse.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.791
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Whitehorse's kid out here

29:00.791 --> 29:02.666
trying to sell me
his own fucking drugs.

29:02.666 --> 29:04.083
How much?

29:04.083 --> 29:05.291
- 50 bucks.
- 35.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.041
- 45!

29:07.041 --> 29:08.166
- 45? This kid...

29:08.166 --> 29:09.750
- 45?

29:10.791 --> 29:12.541
Man.
- Whitehorse.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.291
- Arnie Whitehorse.
- Fuck.

29:14.291 --> 29:15.333
- Alright.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.416
Let's go then.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.416
- Yo, let's go around the back.

29:20.416 --> 29:22.291
That guy was fucking...
- What'd you guys get?

29:22.291 --> 29:24.166
- Just wait till we get home.
- What is it?

29:24.166 --> 29:26.416
- Wait till we get home.
- What is this shit, bro?

29:26.416 --> 29:28.208
- What?
- This shit's fake as fuck.

29:28.208 --> 29:29.958
What'd y'all give me?
What is this?

29:29.958 --> 29:31.291
Fuck!

29:31.291 --> 29:32.375
- Run!

29:34.041 --> 29:36.083
- Dad! Dad!

29:37.750 --> 29:40.166
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
- What the fuck you doing here?

29:40.166 --> 29:41.708
- He's trying to beat us up!
- Who?

29:41.708 --> 29:43.666
- That guy!
- What'd you do?

29:43.666 --> 29:45.958
- I don't know what we did!
- What the fuck did you do?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.458
- Who, this guy?
That's my son.

29:47.458 --> 29:50.000
That's your fuckin--

30:01.541 --> 30:03.833
- Yeah, that's my fucking son!
What's good, bitch?!

30:14.666 --> 30:15.750
- You want some?

30:22.458 --> 30:24.041
- Right here then, WWE style.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.625
Where were you?

31:10.708 --> 31:12.625
- I think I found a job.

31:13.625 --> 31:14.791
- Doing what?

31:15.916 --> 31:17.833
- Working for some white guy.

31:18.583 --> 31:21.416
I made like, 300 taking
some people home.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.250
- Like a taxi?

31:24.250 --> 31:25.666
- I don't know.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.333
I guess.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.541
But I'll be doing
more stuff, too.

31:30.208 --> 31:31.625
- Well, good.

31:31.625 --> 31:33.291
You could bail Carly.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.291
The kid would be happy.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.083
- He already looks happy.

31:40.083 --> 31:42.250
- That's 'cause he's sleeping.

33:26.291 --> 33:27.958
- I saw you dance before.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.375
You're a really good dancer.

33:31.583 --> 33:33.041
- Thanks.

33:33.041 --> 33:34.875
- Can I have a kiss?

33:43.708 --> 33:45.375
- Does it hurt?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.458
- I'll be gentle.

33:50.916 --> 33:52.791
- I wasn't talking about that.

33:52.791 --> 33:55.291
- Oh. What were you
talking about?

33:55.291 --> 33:57.333
- Your face.
- Oh, shit.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.458
My bad.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.041
- Um..

34:05.041 --> 34:07.000
I don't want to do it here.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.666
- Okay.

34:22.458 --> 34:23.750
- Come here.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.291
- Man, you're really goofy, huh?

34:25.291 --> 34:26.708
- You still love me.

34:27.375 --> 34:28.916
Why don't you come outside?

34:28.916 --> 34:30.166
- Holy fuck.
- What?

34:30.166 --> 34:31.666
- What the fuck is that?

34:31.666 --> 34:33.291
- What do you mean?
What do you mean,

34:33.291 --> 34:35.083
what is it? It's a poodle.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.833
- I know it's a fucking
poodle, you idiot.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.333
Where'd you even get her at?

34:38.333 --> 34:40.291
- Does it really matter?
- You probably stole it.

34:40.291 --> 34:42.000
- What makes you think
I stole it?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.833
Don't be thinking like that.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.083
I bought it.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.750
- The most goofiest shit
I've ever heard.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.250
Only you would buy some white
lady-type dog, I swear.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.166
- I'm gonna tell everybody
that she's yours

34:51.166 --> 34:52.625
so I don't look like a pussy.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.708
- Fuck no, you better not tell
nobody that's my dog.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.625
- Why not?
- Why would you even buy it?

34:56.625 --> 34:59.125
Why the fuck would you even
invest in something like this?

34:59.125 --> 35:00.958
- 'Cause, you know,
it's not just mine.
It's yours too.

35:00.958 --> 35:02.541
- So, what?
What do you plan to do?

35:02.541 --> 35:04.875
- I don't know.
What do you want to do with it?

35:04.875 --> 35:06.458
It's half yours.
- I can't take care

35:06.458 --> 35:08.250
of no fucking dog, Bill.
- That's alright.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.208
She's hella great, though.
She could make us rich.

35:11.583 --> 35:13.375
Buy you that car.

35:13.375 --> 35:15.250
Buy you some new clothes.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.208
I'mma get us a trailer
and give you more baby boys.

35:17.208 --> 35:19.583
Oh, you're a fucking rat.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.541
- And you're beautiful.
- Yeah?

35:21.541 --> 35:23.375
- Mm-hmm. You know...

35:27.333 --> 35:28.666
- So, what's up?

35:32.791 --> 35:34.416
- She wants you to come outside.

35:35.291 --> 35:37.500
I want you to come outside.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.208
Please?
- You're fucking crazy.

35:40.208 --> 35:42.708
- You need some help?
- No, I'm good.

35:42.708 --> 35:43.916
- All right.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.833
- Oh, shit.
- Here, can you hold this?

35:46.833 --> 35:47.958
- For what?

35:47.958 --> 35:49.916
- Because you're gonna
stay with me.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.375
- Oh, my God.

37:11.958 --> 37:13.916
- Yo, what the fuck did you do?

37:14.666 --> 37:17.250
You really think I would notice,
you stupid little fuck?!

37:17.250 --> 37:18.750
Fuck you!
Look at me!

37:18.750 --> 37:20.583
Look at me!

37:20.583 --> 37:22.708
Fight back!
Fight back, bitch!

37:22.708 --> 37:23.958
Fight back!

37:25.541 --> 37:26.875
You're a bitch!
Fight me!

37:26.875 --> 37:29.125
You're gonna get me
fucking killed!

37:29.125 --> 37:31.125
Fight back.
Come on, son.

37:31.125 --> 37:32.625
You putting salt
in my fucking shit!

37:32.625 --> 37:34.166
You think I wouldn't notice it?

38:00.625 --> 38:02.916
Get the fuck out of my house.

38:03.625 --> 38:05.250
I don't want you here no more.

39:20.666 --> 39:22.083
- Hey, Bill!

39:22.750 --> 39:24.041
Come on up!

39:38.083 --> 39:39.416
- Here you go.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.875
Okay.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.708
So, the whole point of wine,

40:08.708 --> 40:11.833
Bill, is sipping it slowly

40:11.833 --> 40:13.958
so you can enjoy it.

40:13.958 --> 40:16.458
- Oh, shit.
Thank you.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.000
- Mm-hmm.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.750
- So, do you have any holiday
plans this year?

40:21.750 --> 40:24.333
- Hmm. Not really.

40:24.333 --> 40:27.458
Probably just try
to hang out with my kids.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.791
- I didn't know you had kids.

40:31.125 --> 40:33.041
- Mm-hmm. I got two sons.

40:33.041 --> 40:34.458
- Wow.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.250
Two sons.

40:36.625 --> 40:38.833
That's amazing.
- So listen, Bill.

40:38.833 --> 40:42.458
We own Fall River Farms
and there's a bunch of positions

40:42.458 --> 40:45.916
opening up at the plant
and I was thinking

40:45.916 --> 40:47.583
we could get you started
over there

40:47.583 --> 40:49.166
because I know
you could do with more work.

40:49.166 --> 40:50.833
- So adorable.
- What do you think?

40:50.833 --> 40:52.500
- Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

40:53.083 --> 40:56.291
- Thanksgiving is obviously
our busiest time of year

40:56.291 --> 40:59.041
and we're providing
to three new suppliers this year

40:59.041 --> 41:01.500
which is huge for us.
- Huge.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.333
- Yeah.

41:04.333 --> 41:06.166
- Yeah, Bill.

41:06.166 --> 41:07.958
Bill should help with Halloween.

41:07.958 --> 41:09.625
- Oh, okay.

41:09.625 --> 41:11.666
- Yeah, because last year,

41:11.666 --> 41:15.583
we hired this Mexican company
from Rapid and, well,

41:15.583 --> 41:17.666
one of the employees
pooped on our lawn.

41:17.666 --> 41:20.541
- Okay, honey.
It wasn't a Mexican thing.

41:20.541 --> 41:22.166
It was just a bad manners thing.

41:22.166 --> 41:24.541
- No, he was Mexican.

41:24.541 --> 41:25.916
- He just happened
to be Mexican.

41:25.916 --> 41:28.291
That's not why...
I mean, come on.

41:28.291 --> 41:30.416
- We can laugh about it now.

41:30.416 --> 41:32.708
Like I'm laughing,
but at the time,

41:32.708 --> 41:34.208
it really wasn't that funny.

41:34.208 --> 41:36.291
- Look, someone shat
on our lawn,

41:36.291 --> 41:39.500
who happened
to be Mexican, okay?

41:39.500 --> 41:42.541
Anyway, I'd still love
to keep you around the house

41:42.541 --> 41:45.791
doing personal stuff
if you'd be open to, you know,

41:45.791 --> 41:49.125
having two jobs, but we don't
need to get into all that today.

41:49.125 --> 41:51.208
- Oh, my gosh.
Who's this little doggie?

41:51.833 --> 41:54.041
- Oh, that's Beast.
I'm breeding her,

41:54.041 --> 41:56.208
trying to start my own business.

41:56.208 --> 41:57.833
- Beast?

41:57.833 --> 41:59.833
That's an interesting name.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.000
- Yeah. My son named her,

42:01.000 --> 42:02.375
so no rez dogs
would fuck with her.

42:02.375 --> 42:05.041
I love that.

42:05.041 --> 42:08.375
You really are... You're just,
you're so different.

42:08.375 --> 42:10.500
- He's smart, honey.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.625
Unlike most of
the other guys around here.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.291
- Oh, who is this?

42:14.291 --> 42:16.208
- Someone that's dead to me.

42:16.208 --> 42:18.833
- Oh, sweetie.
I'm so sorry.

42:19.458 --> 42:20.875
- No, it's all right.

42:20.875 --> 42:22.583
- No, no, it isn't.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.958
You poor thing.
When did she pass?

42:24.958 --> 42:26.333
- Huh?

42:26.875 --> 42:28.291
- When did she die?

42:28.833 --> 42:30.958
- We just broke up.

42:30.958 --> 42:32.875
Oh!

42:32.875 --> 42:35.125
I thought she died.

42:35.125 --> 42:37.583
- All right, Bill.
So what did you do?

42:38.958 --> 42:40.291
- Nothing.
- Come on.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.000
You must have done something.
- Nothing.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.416
- Nothing at all, huh?

42:44.416 --> 42:46.500
- See, this is
my new girlfriend.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.000
We also got a kid together.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.375
- Aww.
- Wow.

42:50.208 --> 42:52.583
Well, you want
to hang onto that one,

42:52.583 --> 42:54.333
buy her lots of presents.

42:54.333 --> 42:56.208
Tell her she's always right.

42:56.208 --> 42:58.041
Trust me with this.

42:58.041 --> 42:59.291
Let me tell you something.

42:59.750 --> 43:01.958
If there were no women
in the world,

43:01.958 --> 43:04.125
money would have no meaning.

43:07.041 --> 43:09.875
Matter of fact, Allie,
why don't you take Bill up

43:09.875 --> 43:11.958
to your jewelry box
and give him something

43:11.958 --> 43:14.041
you don't wear anymore
so he can give it to...

43:14.041 --> 43:16.333
What's her name, Bill?
- Echo.

43:16.333 --> 43:17.916
- Ethyl?
- Echo.

43:17.916 --> 43:20.416
- Echo?
- Echo.

43:20.416 --> 43:24.125
- These I got from Alaska.

43:24.125 --> 43:25.458
- Cool.

43:25.458 --> 43:27.500
- But you don't want
these, though.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.958
- Why?
- They have bad juju.

43:31.083 --> 43:35.000
Me and Tim, we almost got
divorced that trip.

43:36.750 --> 43:39.291
We almost get divorced
a lot, but...

43:39.875 --> 43:45.208
Um... I think
Echo would like these.

43:46.125 --> 43:47.500
Dreamcatchers.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.875
- Hmm.

43:49.416 --> 43:51.500
What about those ones?

43:51.500 --> 43:53.125
- Uh... These?

43:53.666 --> 43:55.625
You picked my favorite.

43:55.625 --> 43:57.000
- You just gonna give them
to me?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.958
- Yeah. I'm just
gonna give them to you.

43:58.958 --> 44:01.125
- Wow. Thank you.

44:01.125 --> 44:03.291
- So, anything else?

44:04.333 --> 44:06.083
- No, I'm alright.

44:06.083 --> 44:07.416
- Okay, great.

44:44.625 --> 44:46.166
- I got you this.

44:46.541 --> 44:47.958
- Hi.

44:49.375 --> 44:51.208
- I need some place to stay.

44:51.208 --> 44:52.541
- Why?

44:53.041 --> 44:55.125
- My dad kicked me
out of the house.

44:56.458 --> 44:57.708
- Okay.

45:03.583 --> 45:06.291
I got three rules if you're
gonna be staying here with me.

45:06.916 --> 45:08.416
No fighting in the house.

45:09.541 --> 45:12.958
Keep it real with me, and you
gotta go to school every day.

45:12.958 --> 45:15.291
Go ahead and get comfortable.
Pick a shelf.

45:15.291 --> 45:17.000
This is where
you're gonna be staying.

45:18.208 --> 45:20.625
Don't bring no drama
into my tipi, okay?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.083
- Okay.

45:41.083 --> 45:42.416
Thanks.

45:42.416 --> 45:44.375
- Coffee time.
- Thanks.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.458
- It ain't him.

47:00.666 --> 47:01.958
- Whoa.

47:03.958 --> 47:05.708
- I'm still mad at you.

47:05.708 --> 47:07.208
- I know.

47:08.291 --> 47:09.875
But you love me.

47:10.541 --> 47:12.958
Everything's gonna be
different this time.

48:09.291 --> 48:10.583
- No, keep it.

48:10.583 --> 48:11.958
Keep it.

48:17.666 --> 48:18.958
You alright?

48:20.541 --> 48:21.541
- Yeah.

48:42.416 --> 48:44.000
- So how'd you get the job? Tim?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.500
- Yeah.

48:46.458 --> 48:49.125
- This is one turkey shed
over here,

48:49.125 --> 48:52.541
then there's like,
three or four down that way.

48:54.041 --> 48:57.208
All right, they might be
a little loud, so beware.

48:57.208 --> 48:58.750
- Alright.
- They're crazy, too.

48:58.750 --> 49:00.125
Rowdy. Really rowdy.

49:00.125 --> 49:02.083
Been locked up 24/7.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.541
You got asthma?
- No.

49:08.625 --> 49:10.625
- This is the turkey jerky room.

49:10.625 --> 49:12.166
This is the layout.

49:12.166 --> 49:14.208
The snipping.

49:14.208 --> 49:15.583
The weighing.

49:15.583 --> 49:18.125
This is probably
where you will start out.

49:18.125 --> 49:20.666
And then, we have
the packaging back there.

49:22.125 --> 49:23.208
Yeah.

49:36.458 --> 49:37.750
- Hello?

49:37.750 --> 49:39.541
<i>- This is a prepaid</i><i>
call from...</i>

49:39.541 --> 49:41.666
<i>- Carly. Pick up</i><i>
the phone, bitch.</i>

49:59.666 --> 50:01.125
- Sit.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.041
Come on, girl. Sit.

50:06.041 --> 50:07.166
Beast.

50:07.166 --> 50:08.250
Please!

50:08.833 --> 50:09.916
Sit.

51:30.041 --> 51:32.500
Let's go! Let's go!

51:32.500 --> 51:34.333
Let's go!

52:10.625 --> 52:13.833
- Hey, you need to come get her.
She's not feeling great.

52:13.833 --> 52:15.166
- Like how?

52:15.875 --> 52:17.125
Is she okay?

52:17.125 --> 52:18.625
- Yeah, I don't fucking know.

52:18.625 --> 52:20.791
She was like this
when I picked her up.

52:20.791 --> 52:22.666
You just need
to get her out of here.

52:23.333 --> 52:24.916
- That's not good.

52:25.666 --> 52:28.083
Well, fuck.
What am I supposed to do?

52:28.958 --> 52:31.791
- Um, it's up to her.

52:31.791 --> 52:33.500
Whatever she wants.

52:46.666 --> 52:47.916
- Hey.

52:47.916 --> 52:49.291
Hey!

52:49.291 --> 52:50.708
I think this is it.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.916
I don't speak Lakota.

56:32.333 --> 56:33.500
- Matho.

56:39.375 --> 56:41.250
- We've been looking
all over for you.

56:45.416 --> 56:46.500
- What?

56:49.250 --> 56:50.833
- Bro, I'm sorry
to tell you this.

56:51.625 --> 56:53.708
They found your dad
in the creek.

56:58.250 --> 56:59.666
- I'm sorry.

57:05.458 --> 57:07.125
<i>- I'm finally home.</i>

57:07.958 --> 57:10.416
I gazed upon the Lord's sweet,

57:10.416 --> 57:12.166
smiling face...

57:13.375 --> 57:16.125
And for the first time
in my life...

57:17.750 --> 57:21.458
I knew and felt His grace.

58:32.458 --> 58:34.291
- Can I have a cigarette?

59:27.708 --> 59:29.375
- Hey, I'm gonna head out.

59:29.375 --> 59:30.875
- Hey, Bill.

59:30.875 --> 59:32.916
Come here.
Share this glass with me.

59:47.791 --> 59:49.083
Goddamn.

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:16.666
What's up?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.875
- Who the fuck let you out?

01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:21.833
- Long time, no see, bitch.

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:24.833
Where's my money at?

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:27.583
- Shit.

01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:29.541
I don't know where that shit is.

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.458
- Well, I heard you got
an expensive new dog

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.666
and a fancy job,
so you must have some money.

01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:35.208
- Are you mad at me?

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:36.791
- No.

01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:38.958
I don't expect much from you.

01:00:39.666 --> 01:00:41.083
- Ugh...

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.791
- What you mean, "Ugh?"

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:47.875
- Like, "Ugh, why can't you
just be nice to me?"

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:49.625
- You're fucking weird, man.

01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:52.833
What's that?

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.791
- It's some wine.

01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:57.750
- Look at you trying to act
all brand new and shit.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:00.166
- I just got some
acquired taste.

01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.166
Oh, I gotta fucking throw up.

01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:15.291
- I ain't fucking playing
with you, Bill.

01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:16.791
Man, I want my fucking money.

01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:18.208
- Bet. Oh...

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:44.458
- Come on, Bill. Get up.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.666
- What?
- Nothing.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.750
- Hurry up. I gotta go.

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.125
- Who gave you
all those hickeys?

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:18.500
Huh?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.208
Fuck!

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.750
Where's Beast?

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:28.583
- I don't know.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.750
- Well, what about Carly?
- I have no clue.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.291
- Oh, my God.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.791
- Fucking idiot.

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:41.083
- Hey, did you guys see my dog?
- No.

01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.375
- Hello?

01:02:51.916 --> 01:02:53.458
Yeah, I could do that.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.125
- Stop doing that.

01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:30.791
Could I use the bathroom?

01:03:46.041 --> 01:03:47.666
Watch the fuck out!

01:04:26.458 --> 01:04:27.583
What's up?

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.125
- Hey.

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.375
Hey, Matho.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:39.625
Matho!

01:04:45.666 --> 01:04:47.291
- Get out of there!

01:04:47.291 --> 01:04:48.791
Hustle!

01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:05.541
Boy, go on!
Get out of here!

01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:12.083
- Ah. There you are!
Don't run, now.

01:05:12.083 --> 01:05:14.041
Don't run. Relax, now.
Relax. Relax.

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:15.416
Relax, now.

01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:17.791
We'll go to the office, okay?

01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:19.291
Let's find out what
the trouble is.

01:05:19.291 --> 01:05:21.583
Relax, now. Okay?

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:23.083
All right, we're gonna go.

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.708
<i>- It's Carly.</i><i>
Leave me a message.</i>

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.666
- You want some turkey jerky?
- No.

01:06:03.958 --> 01:06:05.916
- Well, we're going to have
to make a short stop.

01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:07.208
- How short?

01:06:12.416 --> 01:06:14.083
- Where's Carly at?
- Jail.

01:06:14.083 --> 01:06:15.750
They took her back this morning.

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.916
- Well, did you see my dog?
- No.

01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:21.708
- What the fuck do you want?

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:23.208
- Motherfucker,
my motherfucking dog!

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:25.541
- I sold your little
bitch ass dog.

01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:27.708
- Sold him to who?
- To the only other motherfucker

01:06:27.708 --> 01:06:30.375
down here that's dumb enough
to sell fucking poodles
on the fucking rez.

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:32.250
- Man, you shouldn't even be
taking people's shit like that.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.791
- You know what?
That's pretty fucking funny

01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.291
coming from your little
bitch ass, Bill.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:37.291
You left me in jail to go buy
a fucking dog,

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:40.000
so stay in your little fucked up
lane, alright? Fuck you.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.125
- Ooh.

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:54.708
Come on.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.041
- What are you doing? You can't
drive with him like this.

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:15.166
- Why?

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:16.958
- Because he don't
have a car seat.

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:18.666
Yeah, I don't have a car seat.

01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:19.958
- Well, then maybe
you shouldn't be driving

01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:21.625
with him in the first place.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:23.333
Listen, I like that you care,

01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:25.416
but can you just mind your damn
business for five minutes?

01:07:26.708 --> 01:07:29.125
Hey, I need you to watch Mason.
- Where are you going?

01:07:29.125 --> 01:07:30.750
- I have to go find
Beast real quick.

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:33.708
- Oh, no, no no.
I have to go to the
volleyball game.

01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:35.583
- It'll take an hour.
I'll be right back, okay?

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:37.291
I'm sorry.
- Hey, come on, now.

01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:38.833
You're such a butthead.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:42.666
- Has anybody got a taser?

01:07:42.666 --> 01:07:44.625
- What the fuck are you going
to do with a taser

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:47.166
if she has a gun?
- Shit, bro. You ever get tased?

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:48.666
That shit hurts worse,
more than a bullet.

01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:14.416
- Hello?

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:31.291
Hey, yo.

01:08:31.291 --> 01:08:32.916
Where's my dog at?

01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:34.541
Yo!

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:36.707
- What?

01:08:36.707 --> 01:08:38.457
- I said, where's my dog at?

01:08:38.457 --> 01:08:39.791
- I don't fucking know, man.

01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:42.207
Why the fuck is everyone
coming at me today for?

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:44.166
- I'm just looking for my dog.

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:45.832
I'm not trying
to come at you, bro.

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:47.750
- Look, if y'all don't know the
fucking poodle business, man,

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.541
there's nothing
I can do for you.

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.125
So, can you please
get the fuck out?

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:53.082
- Oh, all right.

01:08:53.082 --> 01:08:55.082
Chill, bro.
I'm gone, alright?

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:07.375
She had her babies? Yes!

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:09.000
Go. Go get the boys.

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.125
Goddamn.

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:22.125
What did you even do?

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:29.416
Help me get these in. Yeah.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.791
Look what you did.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.250
- One, two, three, four, five...

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.332
six, seven, eight, nine.

01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:41.332
- Shh. Be quiet.

01:09:41.332 --> 01:09:43.166
- That's $18,000.
- Shh!

01:09:46.457 --> 01:09:47.916
- She's cute.

01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:52.375
- Look, it gots waves.

01:09:55.708 --> 01:09:57.125
Oh, I missed you.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:58.458
Where'd you go?

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:09.083
- Hello?

01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:19.375
- Come on, come on.

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:23.833
<i>The Bible tells us</i><i>
to rejoice in hope,</i>

01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:26.625
<i>to be patient in tribulation.</i>

01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:31.208
<i>There's a lot of problems</i><i>
in our country and...</i>

01:10:32.583 --> 01:10:34.083
<i>I don't...</i>

01:10:35.375 --> 01:10:37.875
<i>God knows that, and so do we.</i>

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:41.791
<i>If we look at creation, and we</i><i>
look at everything around...</i>

01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:43.041
- What the fuck is this?

01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.541
- They didn't give you
extra pineapple?

01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:46.750
- Fuck, I told them.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.541
- Hey, bro.
My dad will go back in there

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:50.083
if they forgot
the extra pineapple

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:51.833
and they'll just
put them on for free.

01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:53.958
- Let me have some.
- Alright, man.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.291
- I didn't have none.

01:10:55.291 --> 01:10:57.625
<i>- ...that'll save you,</i><i>
it'll save me.</i>

01:10:58.458 --> 01:10:59.833
<i>It'll save all of us.</i>

01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:03.958
- What's up?

01:11:07.166 --> 01:11:09.833
Well, why have you been
leaving me on seen?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.583
- Is it true you got
suspended for meth?

01:11:13.583 --> 01:11:15.791
- Who said that?
- Thelma.

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:18.083
- Well, nay.
That's not even true.

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:20.000
- What'd you get suspended for?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.625
- Why do you care?

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:24.166
- My mom said I'm not allowed
to hang around you anymore.

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:26.750
- Why?
- Because she don't trust you.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.333
- Well, she don't even know me.
Tell her to invite me over.

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:31.583
- I don't even want to be
with you anymore.

01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:33.583
- We're not even together.
I only snagged you
that one time.

01:11:33.583 --> 01:11:34.833
- Save it,
because you're disgusting.

01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:36.166
I ain't trying to be
with someone

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:37.500
who can't even
get through high school.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.250
- Well, fuck you, bitch.

01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.000
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.125
- Why are you home from school?

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:18.125
- I think I'm sick.
I don't feel good.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.208
- Hmm.

01:12:43.541 --> 01:12:45.208
What kind of sick are you?

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:50.541
- My stomach kind of hurts,
and I have a sore throat.

01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:01.583
- What are my rules?

01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:04.458
- Don't lie.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:05.791
- Speak up.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.625
- Don't lie, don't fight,
and go to school.

01:13:14.166 --> 01:13:16.166
- They called my house phone.

01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:22.791
- I'll work for you for free.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.750
- Excuse me?

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:28.375
- If you let me stay,
I'll work for you for free.

01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:30.583
- Okay, listen.
You got in trouble,

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:32.125
and you told me
you're staying with me,

01:13:32.125 --> 01:13:34.250
and now you got the whole school
paying attention to me.

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:35.541
You can't work for me at all.

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:37.916
- But they didn't find anything.
I hid it.

01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:40.000
<i>That was the Buddy</i><i>
Red Bow track there.</i>

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.375
<i>I hope you guys enjoyed that.</i>

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.750
- Get out.

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.125
<i>- You're listening</i><i>
to KILI radio...</i>

01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:47.041
- Can I eat first?

01:13:52.541 --> 01:13:54.000
Fuck.

01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:09.125
- Yo, I have to get some gas.

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:10.541
- Fuck.

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:13.125
- Bro, what's wrong with you?
You mad at me?

01:14:13.125 --> 01:14:15.375
- No, you're too fucking
stupid to get mad at.

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:17.500
What do you mean by that?

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.416
- You're fucking boring.

01:14:19.416 --> 01:14:21.083
You think you're interesting,
and you're not.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:23.000
Nobody gives a fuck about
your baby mamas

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.958
or your fucking stupid
stolen dog.

01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:26.250
- Hey, man.
Don't call her stupid.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.125
She's not stupid.
You're stupid.

01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:29.916
- Alright. Well, text Tim.
Tell him I'm gonna be late.

01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:32.000
- What do you mean, text Tim?
Why don't you just text Tim

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.291
if y'all are so close?

01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:35.625
- I never said we was close.

01:14:35.625 --> 01:14:37.500
- Alright, then. So what is it
that y'all be doing?

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.666
What does he do?
Does he pay you or something?

01:14:39.666 --> 01:14:41.708
What's the deal?
- That's not your business.

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:44.666
We just fucking kick it.
- You just kick it? Okay.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.333
You know that he has a lot
of girlfriends, right?

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:53.625
- So?

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:56.166
That's not my place.

01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:08.166
- Ah, fuck.

01:15:08.166 --> 01:15:09.375
- What's wrong?

01:15:09.375 --> 01:15:10.750
- She's about to trip.

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:12.041
- What?
- Just stay in the car.

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:13.750
- I swear you're not playing
with a full deck.

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.166
- Ah, I'm kilt now.

01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:16.750
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.041
I don't like that
kinda energy, bro.

01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:19.750
- You're so fucking stupid.
- What?

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:21.291
- What the fuck?
- Don't trip.

01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.750
- What do you mean, don't trip?

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.333
- Let's go. I'll explain.
- Explain what?

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:25.875
- Beast got stolen.
- What?

01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:27.833
- Come on, Beast got stolen.
- Who's in your car, Bill?

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:30.083
- It's a girl from work.
I have to give her a ride home

01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:32.041
- What do you mean a ride home?
- It's my job.

01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:34.458
- What kind of job requires
you have to give bitches rides?

01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:35.916
Why you pushing me like that?
- Come here.

01:15:35.916 --> 01:15:37.041
- Move! I gotta fucking go!

01:15:37.041 --> 01:15:38.750
- I need you to calm
the fuck down.

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.875
- Wow. Look at your
fucking neck!

01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:42.291
- Man, you're fucking tripping.

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:44.291
- Why the fuck you got
hickeys on your neck?

01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:45.625
- What?
- What?

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.041
- What?
- Let's fucking go!

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.666
- You're fucking gross!

01:15:48.666 --> 01:15:51.000
- Oh, my God.
- Are you taking me, or what?

01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.000
- Let me take you home.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.500
- What, with your other
fucking bitch?

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.708
- Gross. I just met him

01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:57.541
a couple hours ago, but okay.
- Shut up!

01:15:57.541 --> 01:15:58.708
- Get the fuck away from me.

01:15:58.708 --> 01:16:00.208
- Get in the car then.
- Fuck you!

01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:01.916
- Don't tell me
what the fuck to do.

01:16:01.916 --> 01:16:03.750
- Go!
- You fucking go!

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:06.000
- Go! Damn, you're in the car.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:54.291
- This sacrifice,
this ancient spell...

01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:56.333
I hope the land
receives it well.

01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:59.750
And so beneath
the moons descent,

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:02.833
I hope my loved one
might rise again.

01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:07.375
- Wake up, wake up, wake up.

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:09.250
What happened right here?

01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:13.083
You got bit?
- I did.

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:07.708
- Matho!

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:12.250
<i>- Yo, bro, I could ask</i><i>
my grandma if you could</i><i>
spend the night.</i>

01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:14.875
- I asked my mom,
but she wasn't into it.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:17.458
- Bro, I'm good. I'll probably
just stay here for a bit.

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.666
<i>- But, bro, it's boarded up.</i>

01:19:21.666 --> 01:19:24.250
<i>- Well, I can maybe</i><i>
go get some stuff,</i>

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.791
<i>and go decorate it or something.</i>

01:19:26.791 --> 01:19:29.791
<i>- But where are you gonna get</i><i>
furniture and all that stuff?</i>

01:19:29.791 --> 01:19:31.750
<i>- Maybe I'll just go</i><i>
on the swap.</i>

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:34.500
<i>I only need some blankets</i><i>
and a TV.</i>

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:39.208
<i>- I could call my auntie</i><i>
and see if she has an old TV</i><i>
she don't want no more.</i>

01:19:40.541 --> 01:19:42.291
- Bro, if you want
to make it look nice,

01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:44.125
<i>you could get some plants, too.</i>

01:19:44.125 --> 01:19:46.958
<i>- Yeah, and maybe just like</i><i>
a couch to sit on.</i>

01:19:46.958 --> 01:19:49.541
<i>- Yeah, maybe from</i><i>
the dollar store or somewhere.</i>

01:19:49.541 --> 01:19:51.666
<i>- You could also just steal it.</i>

01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:35.875
- It's broken.
- It is.

01:20:36.708 --> 01:20:38.375
I gotta get that fixed.

01:20:40.208 --> 01:20:42.125
I shocked you? My bad.

01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:53.125
Oh, motherfucker.

01:20:54.666 --> 01:20:55.916
Damn.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:20:59.750
Hey.

01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.125
- Echo!

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.041
- You locking me out now?

01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:08.500
- What do you want, Bill?

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.416
- Beast had her puppies.

01:21:12.583 --> 01:21:13.833
- Wow.

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:15.625
- Yo, could I talk
to you for a second?

01:21:15.625 --> 01:21:17.458
- About what?
- I was just driving

01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:19.500
that girl home, and I don't
even know her name

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.833
and I just wanted to tell you
that I'm getting promoted

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:23.916
at work too so I'll have
more money to help you.

01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:26.250
- Anything else?
- What are you doing tonight?

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:28.250
- Why?
- Because I want to know.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.833
- So I could watch Mason?

01:21:30.625 --> 01:21:32.208
- No.

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:34.500
- I have a fucking kid, Bill.
What else would I be doing?

01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:41.083
- Well, let me watch him.
Yeah, let me watch him.

01:21:41.083 --> 01:21:42.791
It's Halloween.
Go out and have some fun.

01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:45.333
- Don't you have work?
- No.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.791
- Okay. That would help.

01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:49.416
Thanks.

01:21:49.416 --> 01:21:51.166
- Yeah, you're welcome.

01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:59.666
You boys okay?

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:02.458
Okay, I'll be back
to check on you guys

01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:04.541
every 10 minutes, alright?
- Yeah.

01:22:04.541 --> 01:22:06.875
- I'll just be right over there.

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:08.541
Okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:10.541
- Watch out for your brother
and those puppies.

01:22:11.416 --> 01:22:13.916
And you got Beast
to protect you, alright?

01:22:14.625 --> 01:22:16.000
All right, I love you.

01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:20.083
- Love you.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:44.708
- Hi.

01:22:44.708 --> 01:22:45.875
- Hi.

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:47.166
- You guys look great.

01:22:47.166 --> 01:22:49.083
Spooky.
- Thank you. You too.

01:22:50.458 --> 01:22:52.916
- I'm Allison.
Bill, you know me.

01:22:52.916 --> 01:22:55.000
- Nice to meet you.
- Alright, yep.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.833
- So, you could help
these guys out.

01:22:57.833 --> 01:22:59.375
They're catering.
- Um...

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:01.125
I got somebody coming tonight

01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:03.083
that I think wants
to buy one of your pups.

01:23:03.083 --> 01:23:04.958
- Man, no shit. For real?
- Yeah, man.

01:23:04.958 --> 01:23:06.291
- Alright then.

01:23:07.666 --> 01:23:12.458
- We have faders, we have all
these Halloween decorations...

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:14.500
- Let's go.

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:30.041
- Bro, let's go.

01:23:37.416 --> 01:23:39.458
- What the fuck you
looking at, man?

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.541
- Hey Bill,
could you take that for me?

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:32.875
- Man, you gotta have a mixer.

01:24:32.875 --> 01:24:34.250
A chaser.

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:35.708
- It's kinda gross.

01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:56.791
Oh, damn.

01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:01.000
- There's leftover back there.

01:25:02.541 --> 01:25:04.750
- Sell this or drink it?

01:25:05.916 --> 01:25:07.625
- Just drink it.
- Are we gonna sell this

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:09.000
or drink it?
- Drink it.

01:25:11.958 --> 01:25:13.041
- Give me that.

01:25:16.416 --> 01:25:17.875
- Scared me.

01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:27.875
- What are you doing?

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:31.416
- Nothing.

01:25:31.416 --> 01:25:34.208
Just looking for some
bottles for upstairs.

01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:37.791
- Oh, okay. Well,
don't let me interrupt you.

01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:46.000
You know, I know about
his little girlfriends.

01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:49.375
It's okay.
It's not like...

01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:54.041
It's not like a thing.
We don't need to talk
about it or anything.

01:25:54.958 --> 01:25:56.583
- Okay.

01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:59.333
- But, like,
it's easier for him now.

01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:05.500
Because he has you,
who lives at the rez and...

01:26:08.166 --> 01:26:13.375
Before, he was just finding
these girls on Facebook and...

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:17.708
- I don't... I don't know
nothing about that.

01:26:17.708 --> 01:26:20.416
- Oh. Well, I do.
I read his messages.

01:26:24.666 --> 01:26:27.291
You know, and like...
I really don't get it.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.833
I don't get it. Personally,
I don't really see the appeal,

01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:34.958
if you know what I mean.

01:26:34.958 --> 01:26:38.250
I don't know if he's got,
like, an Indian fetish

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:40.208
or they're the only ones
that he can con

01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:41.750
into having sex with him.

01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:44.083
- Like I said, I don't know
anything about that.

01:26:45.083 --> 01:26:46.833
- But like, technically...

01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:50.958
Technically, you're like
sex trafficking.

01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:54.416
And you could go
to jail for that.

01:26:57.541 --> 01:27:00.125
And you know, like,
you know that you're not...

01:27:00.125 --> 01:27:02.375
You're not any different
from them.

01:27:12.791 --> 01:27:14.875
- I think I better
get back to work.

01:27:36.041 --> 01:27:37.958
- Let's go. Nobody saw.

01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:45.708
- What are we doing?

01:27:47.291 --> 01:27:49.458
- My Auntie's not coming
back tonight.

01:27:49.458 --> 01:27:50.833
- Where is she?

01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:52.708
- They're all gone
for the weekend.

01:27:52.708 --> 01:27:54.208
- How do you know
she's not coming back?

01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:58.166
- Come on. Get in there.
- Okay.

01:27:58.166 --> 01:27:59.833
- What are we gonna get?

01:27:59.833 --> 01:28:01.375
- Look for the blue bag.

01:28:01.375 --> 01:28:03.375
She keeps all her guns
and meth in there.

01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:06.375
- Wait, what are we getting?
- Shh, shut the fuck up.

01:28:06.375 --> 01:28:09.166
Just find the blue bag.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.250
- Here. Yes, yes, yes.

01:28:14.625 --> 01:28:16.041
- Hustle.

01:28:50.166 --> 01:28:52.000
- This one.
- Yeah!

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.541
Let's go.

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.000
- Alright, here you go.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.416
<i>Screwdriver</i><i>
in the ignition.</i>

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:00.041
- Put it in the ignition.

01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:06.125
Try turning it into the...

01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:07.750
There you go.

01:29:09.625 --> 01:29:10.791
Ooh!

01:29:11.541 --> 01:29:12.625
Holy fuck.

01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:13.625
Fucking fruit.

01:29:13.625 --> 01:29:15.333
- I know.
- Weirdo.

01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:16.791
- Fruits these days.

01:30:06.875 --> 01:30:08.375
- Swing it!

01:30:10.833 --> 01:30:12.000
Disgusting.

01:30:14.458 --> 01:30:16.083
- When you gonna pass it?

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:18.375
- Little Worm... Pass it.

01:30:18.375 --> 01:30:20.916
- Pass it back.
- Little Worm.

01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:25.791
- Bro, pass the blue bag
to the back.

01:30:25.791 --> 01:30:27.250
Where are we going?

01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:29.458
- Bro, let's go to Denver
and sell all of this.

01:30:31.666 --> 01:30:33.041
- Where is Denver?

01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:38.333

It's pretty quiet.

01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:52.625

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:02.958
- Man, you're fucking
scaring me.

01:33:04.541 --> 01:33:06.916
Bro, I mean it, bro.
We gotta go.

01:33:06.916 --> 01:33:08.875
- Then fucking leave!
- Let's go. We gotta go.

01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:11.666
Bro, we ain't taking
responsibility for that.

01:33:11.666 --> 01:33:12.916
Let's go.

01:33:13.875 --> 01:33:15.583
- Someone grab that blue bag.

01:33:25.375 --> 01:33:26.625
- Oh.

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:29.625
Thanks, Bill.

01:33:29.625 --> 01:33:33.083
This one's for me, and this
one's for you guys.

01:33:34.583 --> 01:33:36.166
Drive safe, alright?

01:33:36.166 --> 01:33:37.666
- What about that guy?

01:33:37.666 --> 01:33:39.250
- What guy?

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:41.625
- That guy that you said
would buy that dog?

01:33:42.375 --> 01:33:46.333
- Oh. Well, I know Luis
here doesn't...

01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:48.666
He doesn't want a dog,
because he's allergic to dogs.

01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:51.375
Isn't that right? Yeah.

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:53.958
Hot Dog, you want a dog?
- What kind of dog is it?

01:33:53.958 --> 01:33:56.416
- It's a poodle.
- Absolutely not.

01:33:57.791 --> 01:33:59.291
Uh...

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.291
Cynthia, devil woman,
you want a poodle?

01:34:03.291 --> 01:34:05.041
- No.
- No?

01:34:05.916 --> 01:34:07.750
- Omar, do you want a poodle?

01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:09.541
- No, man.
I already got a dog.

01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:13.000
- All right.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.708
Well... I guess nobody
wants a poodle, Bill.

01:34:18.333 --> 01:34:19.625
- Mm-hmm.

01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:22.083
- Where did that kid
get a poodle?

01:34:28.833 --> 01:34:30.291
- Oh, shit.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.666
- Yo, what the fuck, bro?

01:34:32.666 --> 01:34:34.166
- What are you guys doing?

01:34:34.666 --> 01:34:36.333
What are you doing
out of the car, son?

01:34:36.333 --> 01:34:37.750
- I needed to go
to the bathroom.

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:39.833
- Poor guy.
Are you all right?

01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:42.208
Shit, I'm sorry.

01:34:43.833 --> 01:34:45.375
Where's my dog?

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:47.000
Did you see where she went?

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.291
- I can't see shit.

01:34:50.916 --> 01:34:52.375
- Are you okay?

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:54.083
Aw, don't cry.

01:34:54.083 --> 01:34:56.291
Hold on. Hang on. Hang on.
- What's going on, bud?

01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:57.666
Quit crying.

01:35:03.125 --> 01:35:05.125
- Aw, little guy.

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:06.208
- Where the fuck is she?

01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:07.625
- Fuck, man.
It's cold as fuck.

01:35:07.625 --> 01:35:09.083
- Can you guys see her?
- No, bro.

01:35:09.083 --> 01:35:10.375
Where the fuck's she at, man?

01:35:10.375 --> 01:35:11.666
- Beast!
- Beast!

01:35:11.666 --> 01:35:13.333
Beast! Beast!

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:14.750
- What was that?

01:35:15.333 --> 01:35:17.916
Holy shit. Holy shit.
- Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro!

01:35:23.916 --> 01:35:26.750
- Holy fuck, man.
- Oh, my God.

01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.583
- Bill!

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:56.666
What the fuck happened?

01:35:56.666 --> 01:35:58.208
- Yo, he shot my homie's dog.

01:35:58.208 --> 01:36:00.125
Man, that's some
fucking bullshit.

01:36:00.125 --> 01:36:02.333
- Okay, you need to calm down
right fucking now

01:36:02.333 --> 01:36:04.041
or I'll call the police.

01:36:10.916 --> 01:36:13.541
- You killed my homie's dog
over a fucking turkey!

01:36:14.125 --> 01:36:15.666
- Why are you in my face?

01:36:15.666 --> 01:36:17.333
- Why the fuck are you
in my fucking face?!

01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:19.291
Don't you put your hands on me.

01:36:22.083 --> 01:36:23.625
- Whoa.

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:32.791
- Go home, Bill.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.083
- I don't think I could take
care of these...

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:28.541
- Shay.

01:38:36.791 --> 01:38:39.458
- And maybe you
should keep them.

01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:44.083
And I'm really sorry.

01:38:50.333 --> 01:38:53.333
Well, I guess
I'll see you around.

01:43:15.833 --> 01:43:17.333
- What are you doing?

01:43:22.416 --> 01:43:23.875
Are you okay?

01:43:30.458 --> 01:43:32.041
You got a name?

01:43:36.291 --> 01:43:37.375
Are you hungry?

01:43:40.833 --> 01:43:42.791
What do you want, pancakes?

01:43:47.166 --> 01:43:48.833
A sandwich?

01:43:50.083 --> 01:43:52.666
- I want a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

01:43:54.041 --> 01:43:56.875
- Alright. Well, go sit down.
I'll make it for you.

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:42.625
Do you like coffee?

01:44:50.958 --> 01:44:52.916
Well, you will
whenever you grow up.

01:45:10.375 --> 01:45:12.125
- Who's calling, please?

01:45:18.791 --> 01:45:20.708
- What's up?
- What's up?

01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:22.250
- Sit down.

01:45:28.125 --> 01:45:30.583
- I was wondering if you could
pay out my wages for me.

01:45:30.583 --> 01:45:32.958
- Uh-huh. Okay. Um...

01:45:32.958 --> 01:45:35.250
Your dog killed
one of the turkeys,

01:45:35.250 --> 01:45:37.333
contaminated my personal pen

01:45:37.333 --> 01:45:40.375
and you punched
my cousin in the face.

01:45:40.375 --> 01:45:42.125
- Yeah, but I worked
them two weeks

01:45:42.125 --> 01:45:43.458
and I didn't get paid for it,

01:45:43.458 --> 01:45:44.791
so I'm just asking
for what you owe.

01:45:44.791 --> 01:45:45.916
- Okay.

01:45:45.916 --> 01:45:48.208
You get me 45 turkeys,

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:50.916
and then we can talk
about your pay. How's that?

01:45:50.916 --> 01:45:53.250
- She didn't even do shit
to 45 turkeys.

01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:54.916
She killed one,
but it was on accident,

01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:56.708
and where the fuck am I gonna
get 45 turkeys from?

01:45:56.708 --> 01:45:57.958
- I don't know.

01:45:57.958 --> 01:45:59.333
You could always
try getting a job.

01:46:00.375 --> 01:46:02.333
Or you could steal them.

01:46:02.333 --> 01:46:03.791
Or you could do
a fucking rain dance.

01:46:03.791 --> 01:46:05.333
- You fucking killed my dog.

01:46:05.333 --> 01:46:08.041
I worked them days,
I chopped your wood,

01:46:08.041 --> 01:46:09.333
I cleaned your fucking closet,

01:46:09.333 --> 01:46:11.333
I took them bitches
everywhere for you.

01:46:11.333 --> 01:46:13.000
- Alright, are you done?
- I don't fucking know.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.333
Are you gonna pay me?

01:46:14.333 --> 01:46:16.708
- I'm not gonna pay you
because you fucked up.

01:46:16.708 --> 01:46:19.750
So I think that you should
probably go now.

01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:21.291
And we'll leave it at that.

01:48:11.083 --> 01:48:12.500
- Over here.

01:48:19.458 --> 01:48:20.666
- Hey.

01:48:20.666 --> 01:48:22.458
- Ooh, yeah.

01:48:56.333 --> 01:48:58.041
- Let's go! Hurry up!

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:43.833
- Oh, my God!
