00:07.701 --> 00:09.103
<i>Previously on</i>
Fatal Attraction...

00:12.072 --> 00:13.874
Quincy. Ah!

00:13.874 --> 00:15.543
DAN
Oh, my... Oh, no.

00:15.543 --> 00:18.345
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I've lost an earring.

00:18.345 --> 00:19.847
I always have
time for my friends.

00:19.847 --> 00:21.348
What I don't
have time for, though,

00:21.348 --> 00:22.983
is criminals.

00:22.983 --> 00:25.452
In fact, I have
a professional obligation

00:25.452 --> 00:27.121
to report criminals.

00:27.121 --> 00:29.890
I mean, obviously,
I work in the criminal courts.

00:29.890 --> 00:32.593
Why is there an invoice from the
cleaning service on the counter?

00:32.593 --> 00:34.261
I came home
from work really late

00:34.261 --> 00:35.830
and he had torn the place up.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.231
<i>Hello?</i>

00:37.231 --> 00:38.465
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Uh-oh.</i>

00:38.465 --> 00:40.100
They got a situation

00:40.100 --> 00:41.635
<i>up at Men's Central Jail,
so now they all need</i>

00:41.635 --> 00:42.803
<i>to be interviewed right away.</i>

00:43.737 --> 00:44.839
Can I take these socks?

00:44.839 --> 00:46.640
To each according to his needs.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.276
The walk of shame
closet is a Marxist utopia.

00:49.276 --> 00:51.812
What, so you're admitting
you're doing the walk of shame?

00:51.812 --> 00:53.881
You honestly think I could
pull it off? Living like you?

00:53.881 --> 00:55.149
Tot Mom Casey Anthony

00:55.149 --> 00:56.750
with her hair in a ponytail

00:56.750 --> 00:58.619
like some demonic
cheerleader from hell

00:58.619 --> 01:01.255
- expects us to believe...
- Oh, my God. Wow.

01:01.255 --> 01:02.890
She makes it all seem so simple.

01:03.724 --> 01:04.825
Um, this is Alex...

01:04.825 --> 01:06.293
- Forrest.
- Alex Forest.

01:06.293 --> 01:07.928
- My husband Dan.
- No, I know him already.

01:07.928 --> 01:09.396
It's starting
to make me feel like

01:09.396 --> 01:10.865
maybe I misunderstood something,

01:10.865 --> 01:12.132
except I really don't think

01:12.132 --> 01:13.234
<i>that I did.</i>

01:14.602 --> 01:16.337
<i>And I'm not going to be ignored,</i>

01:16.337 --> 01:17.905
<i>Dan.</i>

01:29.683 --> 01:32.653
You were what, eight?

01:33.587 --> 01:35.856
Did you even know
what an affair was?

01:37.157 --> 01:38.559
No.

01:38.559 --> 01:41.695
That was too much information
for you so young.

01:41.695 --> 01:43.664
What did you make of it?

01:45.032 --> 01:46.734
I mean, I didn't.

01:46.734 --> 01:48.903
You know, like you said,
it was just...

01:48.903 --> 01:50.838
it seemed bad.

01:51.639 --> 01:52.706
And my mom was different

01:52.706 --> 01:55.009
- after it.
- Different how?

01:56.977 --> 01:58.279
I don't know.

02:00.381 --> 02:03.250
I think she was probably scared.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.087
I know I was.

02:09.556 --> 02:11.692
I was thinking
about asking her now.

02:11.692 --> 02:13.460
Asking her about what?

02:13.460 --> 02:14.461
We've just never

02:14.461 --> 02:17.431
talked about it before.

02:17.431 --> 02:18.699
Ever.

02:18.699 --> 02:20.100
I mean, it's not like...

02:20.100 --> 02:21.702
like, it's not like
it's, like, a secret,

02:21.702 --> 02:25.005
but just like what
that was like for her.

02:25.973 --> 02:26.807
You know?

02:26.807 --> 02:28.108
'Cause maybe she really wants

02:28.108 --> 02:29.944
to talk about it,
for us to talk about it.

02:29.944 --> 02:32.780
But also
maybe she really doesn't.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.214
I'm gonna relieve you

02:34.214 --> 02:36.884
of the job of taking
care of your mom here.

02:36.884 --> 02:39.553
It's been a long time,
and she's a big girl.

02:39.553 --> 02:42.222
But she's been a good mother.

02:42.222 --> 02:46.293
Loving, supportive.
Right? Would you say?

02:47.594 --> 02:48.929
So,

02:48.929 --> 02:51.665
maybe with everything
else happening recently,

02:51.665 --> 02:53.834
now you're just
feeling this needs to be

02:53.834 --> 02:56.103
out there between you, finally,

02:56.103 --> 02:57.237
in some form.

02:57.237 --> 02:58.906
Yeah.

03:00.274 --> 03:02.209
Yeah, I just don't
know where to start.

03:02.209 --> 03:06.647
Well, I don't want
to give you a script.

03:07.815 --> 03:09.950
Unless you want one.

03:17.324 --> 03:20.094
You could start like,

03:20.094 --> 03:24.431
"So much has been
coming up for me lately,

03:24.431 --> 03:25.666
"coming back to me.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.835
"Memories, emotions.

03:27.835 --> 03:31.238
"I feel like I'm
rethinking everything,

03:31.238 --> 03:33.173
"and because I love you,

03:33.173 --> 03:36.810
"I want to tell you
about the things

03:36.810 --> 03:39.713
I've been carrying
that I didn't ask to know."

03:42.483 --> 03:43.917
<i>I'm excited to move.</i>

03:43.917 --> 03:45.986
<i>Me, too. I love our new house.</i>

03:45.986 --> 03:47.955
Well, I'm excited for the pool.

03:47.955 --> 03:50.057
You have mentioned that.

03:52.226 --> 03:54.328
I'm not excited
about having to pack

03:54.328 --> 03:57.398
all the rest of my stuff
and then unpack my stuff,

03:57.398 --> 03:58.799
but I love my new room,

03:58.799 --> 04:01.835
and Quincy's going to
love the backyard.

04:04.138 --> 04:06.040
Does it smell weird
in here to you?

04:06.040 --> 04:06.840
Smells nice,

04:06.840 --> 04:09.410
like lemon flowers.

04:09.410 --> 04:12.279
Yeah, that's what I mean.
We've been gone for four days.

04:12.279 --> 04:13.981
It should smell like Quincy.

04:13.981 --> 04:15.849
Maybe Daddy had
the cleaning service come.

04:15.849 --> 04:18.419
They're scheduled to
come the day after we move.

04:19.386 --> 04:21.155
Maybe he cleaned it himself.

04:21.155 --> 04:22.523
Uh, no.

04:23.557 --> 04:25.993
Smells so good in here, it's
making us smell so much worse.

04:25.993 --> 04:27.661
Go shower, he's going
to be home any minute.

04:27.661 --> 04:29.029
Okay.

04:32.232 --> 04:33.667
<i>Don't try to be cute.</i>

04:33.667 --> 04:36.437
You know you ate
my Patriots blanket,

04:36.437 --> 04:38.405
and I'm still angry at you.

04:49.650 --> 04:50.751
What...

04:50.751 --> 04:52.052
Is this your new thing now?

04:52.052 --> 04:54.321
You're eating things
that aren't food?

04:56.323 --> 05:00.127
Hope nobody posted flyers
saying they lost an earring.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.101
Come on.

05:07.101 --> 05:08.836
<i>They're withholding approvals,</i>

05:08.836 --> 05:10.938
<i>not allowing access
to work areas.</i>

05:10.938 --> 05:12.573
Remember when we
excavated their patio

05:12.573 --> 05:13.874
and there was another
patio underneath?

05:13.874 --> 05:15.442
And Bruce thought
we should pay for it

05:15.442 --> 05:17.544
because we should have
known it was there. I do.

05:17.544 --> 05:19.880
I do remember that.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.815
Fuck it. I'm ordering
honey walnut shrimp

05:21.815 --> 05:24.017
because I can't work all night

05:24.017 --> 05:26.053
on steamed chicken
and vegetables.

05:26.053 --> 05:28.255
Okay, so I had Lena
print out clean copies

05:28.255 --> 05:29.590
so that we can triage

05:29.590 --> 05:30.791
on a blank slate.

05:30.791 --> 05:32.559
Oh. Julia?

05:32.559 --> 05:34.495
Hey.

05:35.462 --> 05:37.197
Well, just tell her Gretchen

05:37.197 --> 05:39.433
always flushes out
your PICC line.

05:39.433 --> 05:43.137
Look it, this is well within
the duties of a chemo nurse.

05:45.305 --> 05:48.809
Baby, just-just put
her on the phone, please.

05:52.079 --> 05:54.715
Hello?
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

05:54.715 --> 05:56.950
- Uh-oh.
<i>- Yeah, there's been an incident</i>

05:56.950 --> 05:58.185
<i>down in Men's Central Jail.</i>

05:58.185 --> 05:59.920
- No.
<i>- Frank's supposed to be on call,</i>

05:59.920 --> 06:01.388
<i>but they can't reach him
and he's not picking up,</i>

06:01.388 --> 06:02.489
<i>so I got to go.</i>

06:02.489 --> 06:04.791
Fucking Frank.

06:06.193 --> 06:08.962
Hey, Bethy, you want a salad?

06:08.962 --> 06:10.564
Arthur and I are going to
have to work through

06:10.564 --> 06:11.832
all this shit over the phone,

06:11.832 --> 06:14.601
and we need
an actual dinner plan.

06:14.601 --> 06:16.537
Your mother made a thing.

06:21.241 --> 06:24.378
- Locking it up.
- Put the oven on 400.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.883
- Cheers.
- Mm-hmm.

06:29.883 --> 06:31.518
Mm-hmm.

06:32.853 --> 06:36.190
"In love, the faithful must pay
with the blood of their hearts.

06:36.190 --> 06:40.027
"Otherwise their love
is not worth a grain of rye.

06:40.027 --> 06:41.895
"So you are leading me,

06:41.895 --> 06:44.498
"revealing the true
faith of love,

06:44.498 --> 06:49.336
"even if your faith shall
remain hidden from me forever.

06:49.336 --> 06:52.673
"Let my love for you be
the guardian of my secrets.

06:52.673 --> 06:56.710
"Let the grief
which this love brings me

06:56.710 --> 06:59.112
be my soul's caress."

06:59.913 --> 07:00.814
Wow, she's got it bad.

07:00.814 --> 07:01.982
It's not a "her."

07:01.982 --> 07:03.317
No, it's a Romeo,

07:03.317 --> 07:04.318
not the Juliet.

07:04.318 --> 07:05.886
I beg your pardon.

07:05.886 --> 07:08.088
Although this is a thousand
years older than that,

07:08.088 --> 07:11.058
so actually,
Romeo was the Majnun

07:11.058 --> 07:12.826
of Elizabethan drama.

07:12.826 --> 07:14.962
Layla's parents
wouldn't let Majnun

07:14.962 --> 07:17.431
marry her, and so he
went out to the desert

07:17.431 --> 07:18.498
and went crazy.

07:18.498 --> 07:19.600
Hmm.
- Mmm.

07:20.467 --> 07:21.835
What would you have
done if your parents

07:21.835 --> 07:23.503
hadn't let you marry Grandpa?

07:23.503 --> 07:24.972
Are you kidding?

07:24.972 --> 07:27.608
Grandpa was a naval lieutenant
going to Wharton.

07:27.608 --> 07:30.077
My parents
made me marry Grandpa.

07:30.077 --> 07:33.313
So did they end
up together or not?

07:33.313 --> 07:36.883
Well, the man that Layla's
parents made her marry dies,

07:36.883 --> 07:38.952
and so then she goes
out to the desert

07:38.952 --> 07:40.721
to tell Majnun they can
finally be together,

07:40.721 --> 07:42.322
and he says no.

07:42.322 --> 07:44.424
Yeah, because he had
embroidered on her

07:44.424 --> 07:48.295
so much in his mind
all those years alone,

07:48.295 --> 07:51.098
so the actual her
just couldn't live up.

07:51.098 --> 07:53.934
You know, it's an
allegory, but for what,

07:53.934 --> 07:55.435
I don't know.

07:55.435 --> 07:57.170
I just like the part
where he lives in the cave

07:57.170 --> 07:58.805
with all the animals.

07:58.805 --> 08:00.240
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- That is the dream.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.876
I'm gonna check on dinner.

08:03.777 --> 08:07.748
"Not only have I lost you,
I no longer know myself.

08:07.748 --> 08:12.019
I keep turning upon myself
and asking, what is your name?"

08:21.595 --> 08:23.630
<i>"Are you in love?</i>

08:23.630 --> 08:25.632
<i>"With whom?</i>

08:25.632 --> 08:28.001
<i>Or are you loved? By whom?"</i>

08:31.305 --> 08:34.274
Hey.

08:34.274 --> 08:36.209
You did it.

08:36.209 --> 08:37.577
Hey!

08:37.577 --> 08:39.379
<i>"Do I still know where I live?</i>

08:39.379 --> 08:41.648
<i>Do I still taste what I eat?"</i>

08:43.283 --> 08:45.552
<i>"The fire burns within me.</i>

08:45.552 --> 08:48.789
<i>"The fire beyond measure,</i>

08:48.789 --> 08:52.592
<i>which has turned
my being to ashes."</i>

08:52.592 --> 08:53.827
- It's that one.
- This one?

08:53.827 --> 08:56.797
No, baby. Aw. No, no. No!

08:56.797 --> 08:59.266
Baby? Oh. Babe?

08:59.266 --> 09:01.101
- Welcome to your new home.
- Babe?

09:01.101 --> 09:04.071
<i>"I'm lost in my own wilderness."</i>

09:12.212 --> 09:15.782
<i>"Do not try to bring me
back to the world of humans.</i>

09:15.782 --> 09:17.818
<i>I'm a stranger to them."</i>

09:17.818 --> 09:18.885
Hello, hello,

09:18.885 --> 09:20.620
you darling girl. Oh, my God.

09:20.620 --> 09:24.257
How-how are you this big?
How are you this big?

09:34.034 --> 09:36.503
<i>"I am drawn to death.</i>

09:36.503 --> 09:39.539
<i>Death is within me."</i>

09:46.513 --> 09:48.982
The suitcase that sat on the
landing for three weeks after

09:48.982 --> 09:50.517
they got home from vacation

09:50.517 --> 09:53.720
because neither of them
would bring it upstairs.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.089
That pool cover is our suitcase.

09:56.089 --> 09:58.091
And I even tried to do a Debra

09:58.091 --> 09:59.493
and make it into a competition.

09:59.493 --> 10:00.827
Which didn't work
'cause we don't actually

10:00.827 --> 10:01.995
live in <i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

10:01.995 --> 10:03.196
Wait, isn't it just

10:03.196 --> 10:05.132
like a button you have to press?

10:05.132 --> 10:08.001
It's not like you have to
break rocks in the hot sun.

10:08.001 --> 10:09.770
No, it's not a button
you have to push.

10:09.770 --> 10:12.406
You got to hold that fucking
thing down for, like, a minute.

10:12.406 --> 10:15.108
Who has the time to
stand around for a minute?

10:15.108 --> 10:16.209
Well, not you. Have you met you?

10:16.209 --> 10:18.345
You've got important shit to do.

10:18.345 --> 10:19.846
You two like to poke the bear.

10:19.846 --> 10:20.914
Or you could just go out there

10:20.914 --> 10:21.948
and do it right fucking now.

10:21.948 --> 10:23.683
It's still open right now?

10:23.683 --> 10:24.785
No.

10:24.785 --> 10:26.286
I thought this was just like

10:26.286 --> 10:28.155
an ongoing bone of contention.
No, no.

10:28.155 --> 10:29.756
- Danny...
- I was just about to do it.

10:29.756 --> 10:31.658
I was, I promise, I really was.

10:31.658 --> 10:33.360
But then they arrived,
and we had guests,

10:33.360 --> 10:35.429
I didn't want to be rude.
Oh, my God.

10:35.429 --> 10:37.097
That makes
perfect sense.
- Okay, I'm going to do it.

10:37.097 --> 10:38.598
- No, no, no.
- Somebody tell me how to do it.

10:38.598 --> 10:39.800
- No, you're not. I made cake.
- Sit back down.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.001
You're going to eat cake.

10:41.001 --> 10:43.003
The cake? The... With the cream?

10:43.003 --> 10:44.738
Yeah, it's in the fridge,

10:44.738 --> 10:47.107
so sit your ass down.

10:47.107 --> 10:48.809
- Your favorite.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:51.845 --> 10:54.448
Oh, did they ever
find that woman?

10:54.448 --> 10:56.116
The one you thought was dead?

10:56.116 --> 10:57.584
I still think
she's dead, but no.

10:57.584 --> 10:58.618
What's this now?

10:58.618 --> 11:00.454
Sylvie Rubidoh.

11:00.454 --> 11:02.189
Her kids report her missing,

11:02.189 --> 11:04.257
husband says that he's at work,

11:04.257 --> 11:05.759
but we know he's lying

11:05.759 --> 11:07.527
'cause he gamed
the login system and snuck out.

11:07.527 --> 11:09.095
So where does he say

11:09.095 --> 11:10.530
he thinks she is now?

11:10.530 --> 11:12.699
Well, he says she ran off
with a boyfriend, but...

11:12.699 --> 11:14.367
Ah.
Have you arrested him?

11:14.367 --> 11:17.037
Or can you arrest someone

11:17.037 --> 11:19.072
for murder if
you don't have the body?

11:19.072 --> 11:21.074
Yeah, you can,
but we usually don't.

11:29.282 --> 11:31.685
Aren't they just
going to keep calling?

11:32.719 --> 11:36.089
Yeah. Yeah, they will, until
they give up and pass it off

11:36.089 --> 11:37.557
to Frank, who needs
to redeem himself

11:37.557 --> 11:39.159
after that whole
county jail thing

11:39.159 --> 11:40.760
that he foisted on me.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.329
Am I right?

11:43.997 --> 11:45.799
When you're right, you're right.

11:48.702 --> 11:50.070
Yeah, get it.

11:50.070 --> 11:51.104
It's awful, right?
Good, right?

11:51.104 --> 11:52.439
Thank you.

12:06.419 --> 12:08.355
Good morning.
- Oh.

12:08.355 --> 12:09.890
12th floor called.

12:10.824 --> 12:12.092
What about?

12:12.092 --> 12:12.729
Just said come
as soon as you get in.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.840
- Thanks-- oh.
- Oh.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.241
Dan. Good.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.377
Listen, we've got
a kind of a turf dispute,

12:24.377 --> 12:26.312
and I need you to weigh in.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.414
Assaults where
victims were targeted

12:28.414 --> 12:32.451
for being females over 70 are
obviously crimes against women.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.387
I don't understand what
we're even doing right now.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.721
So just to catch up,

12:35.721 --> 12:38.090
Jorge caught a case,
and Earl's here

12:38.090 --> 12:40.493
'cause he brought it to Jorge?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.428
Also because people assume I got
no other shit to do but be here.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.430
Earl's been working it
for six months,

12:44.430 --> 12:46.832
- and it's definitely a pattern.
- Against women.

12:46.832 --> 12:48.267
A pattern against women.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.903
Patterns are historically
Major Crimes Bureau.

12:50.903 --> 12:53.205
Because historically
the Crimes against Women Bureau

12:53.205 --> 12:54.740
didn't exist,
Marcella, which is why

12:54.740 --> 12:58.311
you set it up.
For this specific reason.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.712
Not to conform to history.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.447
And you guys have been
doing amazing work,

13:01.447 --> 13:03.215
which I've supported right
from the very beginning.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.153
Literally was like this
when I got here.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.888
I mean, why someone
would make something

13:08.888 --> 13:10.156
that's supposed to be a globe
in two pieces, I don't know.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.958
It's a fucking ball.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.159
How many victims do we have?

13:13.159 --> 13:15.061
11.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.630
11 is a major case. We have
the resources. We'll handle it.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.032
You have the resources
because you get the cases.

13:20.032 --> 13:23.569
I hear you, but Jorge and
Earl have an amazing shorthand.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.104
As we get
into the investigation,

13:25.104 --> 13:26.305
we're bound
to turn up more victims,

13:26.305 --> 13:27.840
and then once it goes to trial,

13:27.840 --> 13:29.141
I'll take the lead.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.509
Well, since it came through

13:30.509 --> 13:32.678
Major Crimes,
let's keep it there.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.246
I want updates.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.618
Thanks.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.892
Well, it's fun watching
you guys match piss.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.694
I mean, not compared
to something actually fun.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.296
Don't worry, nobody
was under the impression

13:50.296 --> 13:52.498
that you were having fun.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.200
That's pretty disrespectful
to the boss,

13:54.200 --> 13:55.735
who is my direct boss

13:55.735 --> 13:57.403
and your boss, too.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.804
You think I don't know who
the boss is and who it isn't?

13:58.804 --> 14:00.740
No, actually, sometimes
I think you don't.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.442
Well, we all can't be political
animals like you, Danny.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.944
I mean, but it's okay, though,

14:04.944 --> 14:06.712
'cause somebody's got
to be the audience, right?

14:07.513 --> 14:08.748
<i>Hi, welcome.</i>

14:08.748 --> 14:10.750
I'm Beth Gallagher. Hi.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.752
I'm the owner, as
in "For sale by owner."

14:12.752 --> 14:14.286
Thank you.

14:15.287 --> 14:16.856
I'm right here if
you have any questions.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.290
Mm-hmm.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.395
So I actually did the remodel
myself through my company.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.464
Um, hi, I'm Beth.
I'm the owner.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.966
- Uh, the sign-in
is in the kitchen.
- Okay.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.535
I'll be with you in a second.
Thank you. Sorry.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.570
- Oh, hey. I'm the owner.
- Mm-hmm.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.507
Uh, if you have any questions
about the house, come find me.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.742
Otherwise, have fun
looking around.

14:37.576 --> 14:38.911
Oh, hey, I'm Beth.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.213
I'm the owner.
I did the remodel myself,

14:41.213 --> 14:42.415
so if you have any questions...

14:42.415 --> 14:43.683
I'll find you.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.685
Great. Oh, here,
let me get that for you.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.219
Thank you.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.388
It's lovely through here.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.297
It's so cute.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.332
It's nice.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.140
I'm sure you've been
hearing this all day,

15:08.140 --> 15:11.143
but this place is amazing, Beth.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.745
Why would you ever
want to leave it?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.681
I have that exact
thought once a day.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.384
I'm like, "You're
making a terrible mistake.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.153
"Think of all the memories
you have at this place.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.655
You're out of your mind."

15:22.655 --> 15:26.792
But I think any big move
in life is like that, right?

15:27.827 --> 15:28.828
Right?

15:28.828 --> 15:29.962
Right.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.698
Yeah, giant, life-changing leaps

15:32.698 --> 15:34.667
always seem like a-a great idea

15:34.667 --> 15:36.602
until you actually
have to take one.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.437
Exactly.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.743
What about you?

15:43.743 --> 15:46.512
What, I don't know,
life-changing leap

15:46.512 --> 15:48.881
would this maybe be for...

15:48.881 --> 15:50.216
Sorry, what's your name?

15:50.216 --> 15:51.617
Sorry, I should have
asked you already.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.253
Alex Forrest. My first house.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.855
Wow.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.657
Oh, I love that.
And I love this for you.

15:58.657 --> 15:59.692
Me, too.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.427
All the best things
that happened

16:01.427 --> 16:03.829
in my adult life happened here.

16:03.829 --> 16:04.997
I got married,

16:04.997 --> 16:07.366
started a business
with my best friend,

16:07.366 --> 16:08.734
I had a kid.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.803
She had all
her first milestones here.

16:11.837 --> 16:15.441
It's truly been magical.
No fooling.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.546
But you're headed somewhere
even better next, I assume.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.782
Not better, just different.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.018
Oh, then the best
is yet to come.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.622
Or just keep
telling yourself that.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.359
Hey.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.927
Hi.

16:34.927 --> 16:38.230
This is Alex. I'm so sorry,
I forgot your last name.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.999
- Forrest.
- Alex Forrest.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.100
My husband Dan.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.035
Dan, this is Alex Forrest.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.703
I know him already.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.208
From, uh,

16:49.208 --> 16:51.343
<i>the criminal courts.</i>

16:51.343 --> 16:53.946
<i>I work in Victim Services.</i>

16:53.946 --> 16:56.282
<i>That's with Conchita, right?</i>

16:56.282 --> 16:57.483
<i>Right.
Wow.</i>

16:57.483 --> 16:59.251
<i>Are you kidding? (chuckles)</i>

17:00.586 --> 17:02.454
<i>You were right, Beth.</i>

17:02.454 --> 17:04.757
<i>This place,
I mean, it's-it's magical.</i>

17:08.661 --> 17:11.564
<i>We've been very happy here.</i>

17:22.074 --> 17:24.143
No, she-she had a bad reaction,

17:24.143 --> 17:26.579
that's why they switched her.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.348
No, no, he did. I mean,
he warned us about the nausea,

17:29.348 --> 17:30.616
but still.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.485
She's IV, though.

17:33.485 --> 17:37.623
Can they do saline
hydration for IV only?

17:38.457 --> 17:41.193
Great. No, no, no.
Thank you. Thank you.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.628
Hey. Sorry.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.264
Pironen Plumbing.

17:45.264 --> 17:49.168
Apparently they are
independent subcontractors,

17:49.168 --> 17:50.703
so Andy can't tell them anything

17:50.703 --> 17:54.273
about their appearance
or their odor.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.575
What's the matter?

17:56.575 --> 17:59.178
What, this isn't enough?

17:59.178 --> 18:03.682
I know what this is,
but what's the matter?

18:05.284 --> 18:06.485
Nothing.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.821
Nothing real.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.423
Well, if it's real to you,

18:11.423 --> 18:13.125
it's real.

18:17.496 --> 18:18.964
Put it into words.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.100
Change its nature.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.003
Take its power.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.005
Thought into action.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.075
What's the action?

18:30.075 --> 18:31.911
Saying it out loud.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.983
No?

18:41.787 --> 18:44.023
Well, it turns out, um,

18:44.023 --> 18:48.193
Julia's cancer is what
they call platinum resistance.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.597
And the doctors don't know

18:51.597 --> 18:53.465
what drug to put her on next,

18:53.465 --> 18:55.668
and whatever they do
needs to work.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.837
And here I am, over here,

18:58.837 --> 19:01.073
not knowing anything.

19:01.073 --> 19:04.810
And I can't do
anything about anything.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.252
You can fire the plumbers.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.122
Yeah?

19:17.122 --> 19:19.858
But you love to do that.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.260
Okay.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.075
You don't have to
appreciate the effort

19:36.075 --> 19:39.144
it's taking for me not to get
super fucking salty right now,

19:39.144 --> 19:41.647
but you are going to tell me
what the fuck is going on.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.250
One time? Ten times?

19:45.250 --> 19:47.386
More than one.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.254
Okay, so then why is she

19:49.254 --> 19:51.557
throwing acid on your car,
if you had to guess?

19:51.557 --> 19:53.125
Mike, I thought
I had this handled.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.594
Then the other day,
we're having the open house,

19:55.594 --> 19:57.229
and she shows up
in my fucking home.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.698
Goddamn it.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.938
I'm sorry, Mike.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.207
You have no idea how sorry I am.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.675
Okay, okay.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.610
But I need to know
what to do here.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.912
This is a pretty big
fucking play on her part.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.049
Yes, it is, and it's
designed to generate

20:17.049 --> 20:21.120
a big response, and my vote
is... don't respond at all.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.589
If you tell someone
to stop calling you

20:23.589 --> 20:24.823
and they keep calling,

20:24.823 --> 20:26.592
and the 20th time, you pick up

20:26.592 --> 20:28.460
and say, "Would you
stop fucking calling me?"

20:28.460 --> 20:31.430
What you've just taught them is
that 20 calls is what it takes.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.833
And how many times

20:34.833 --> 20:36.769
have I told you to park
where the fucking cameras

20:36.769 --> 20:38.437
can see your car?

20:38.437 --> 20:40.773
Fuck. Honestly,
now do you get it?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.908
Goddamn, man.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.146
Morning, humpy.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.814
Hey, don't mind me.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.249
I'm not naked.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.017
Anymore.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.485
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.254
Ahem.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.190
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.528
Is this really your old
lucky testimony tie,

21:02.528 --> 21:03.896
or does it just look like it?

21:03.896 --> 21:04.997
What, you think
you won't get hired

21:04.997 --> 21:07.332
because my tie is out of style?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.204
I don't know, Mike.

21:17.476 --> 21:20.779
I don't know what
the fuck I'm doing. I mean...

21:22.081 --> 21:23.782
...who's going to hire
a convicted murderer

21:23.782 --> 21:26.051
to be in their paralegal
department? Seriously.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.322
You want to know how
many job interviews I went on

21:30.322 --> 21:32.157
before my dad called
the D.A.'s office for me?

21:32.157 --> 21:33.792
Hmm?

21:34.593 --> 21:36.195
Zero.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.197
I've literally
never done this before.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.064
Look, what law firm

21:39.064 --> 21:41.567
is going to turn down the chance

21:41.567 --> 21:43.035
to get the head
of Major Crimes Bureau

21:43.035 --> 21:45.471
on a paralegal salary? Hmm?

21:45.471 --> 21:47.606
It's just the kind of greedy,
sneaky, advantage-taking shit

21:47.606 --> 21:50.409
that lawyers live for, right?
Now, look,

21:50.409 --> 21:51.777
stop psyching yourself out

21:51.777 --> 21:53.679
and go out there and get a job.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.247
You know, your rent
may be next to nothing,

21:55.247 --> 21:57.182
but if you don't pay it,

21:57.182 --> 21:59.751
your landlady's going to come
down on you with both bunions.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.288
<i>So, you remember
when Jung's wife</i>

22:03.288 --> 22:04.990
<i>saw that house
with the beautiful door?</i>

22:04.990 --> 22:06.458
And then he went back and
there was no house there.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.726
- Yeah.
- Right.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.661
So a little while later,
Jung is in Italy

22:09.661 --> 22:11.797
with a colleague
named Toni Wolff,

22:11.797 --> 22:13.465
and they were visiting a church,

22:13.465 --> 22:14.833
and inside the baptistry there

22:14.833 --> 22:16.935
they saw these
beautiful mosaics,

22:16.935 --> 22:19.371
huge tile scenes on every wall.

22:19.371 --> 22:20.506
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.107
So when they get back,

22:22.107 --> 22:24.042
Jung had another close colleague
who was going to Italy,

22:24.042 --> 22:27.212
and he told him, "You have to
see these amazing mosaics."

22:27.212 --> 22:29.214
That didn't exist.

22:29.214 --> 22:30.382
Right.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.151
So now Jung had had
the same experience

22:32.151 --> 22:35.587
as his wife,
and plus, his had been shared

22:35.587 --> 22:37.256
because there was another person

22:37.256 --> 22:39.358
that had participated simultaneously,

22:39.358 --> 22:42.594
and still, apparently,
it hadn't happened.

22:42.594 --> 22:44.796
So how did he
explain it this time?

22:44.796 --> 22:47.032
Well, remember...

22:47.032 --> 22:49.134
Jung considered his wife
totally trustworthy,

22:49.134 --> 22:51.570
so he'd believed her even before
the same thing happened to him.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.405
So his position was,

22:53.405 --> 22:55.707
when we have an experience

22:55.707 --> 22:59.144
that we can't understand

22:59.144 --> 23:02.848
or that doesn't
match conventional reality,

23:02.848 --> 23:06.285
then we can't use
that reality to explain it.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.155
Also, it might be relevant
that when they were in Italy,

23:10.155 --> 23:12.824
Toni Wolff was Jung's mistress.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.395
I'm s-- It might be relevant?

23:16.395 --> 23:19.364
And which his wife knew
and was okay with.

23:19.364 --> 23:20.799
Well, what was Jung's

23:20.799 --> 23:22.734
source of information
on that? Was it him?

23:25.871 --> 23:27.105
No.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.907
There are a lot
of books out there

23:28.907 --> 23:30.976
that you can read
that talk all about it.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.212
I want to read that stuff.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.646
Oh, good. Then maybe
you will find

23:34.646 --> 23:36.248
something in them
to write about.

23:37.015 --> 23:38.850
'Cause it bears saying out loud,

23:38.850 --> 23:41.720
even by a generous timetable,
you are behind.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.021
I know.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.156
You should be outlining by now.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.958
Yeah, I've been distracted.

23:45.958 --> 23:49.194
I've been seeing my father,

23:49.194 --> 23:52.164
and I haven't seen him
since I was ten.

23:52.898 --> 23:54.132
Oh, then...

23:54.132 --> 23:56.235
that, uh, that
could be difficult

23:56.235 --> 23:57.836
no matter what the reason is.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.739
He was in prison
for second degree murder.

24:00.739 --> 24:03.342
Yeah.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.378
But he's paroled.

24:07.913 --> 24:09.548
And he's out now.

24:09.548 --> 24:11.950
Do you...

24:11.950 --> 24:13.919
need an extension?

24:13.919 --> 24:17.456
Um, I think I'm okay.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.258
But thanks.

24:20.025 --> 24:22.628
And thanks for, uh,
for all this.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.629
Oh, no, no, no, no.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.964
This, this? This is all...

24:25.964 --> 24:27.532
This is fun for me, really,

24:27.532 --> 24:29.835
being an armchair Jung expert.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.903
Or not even.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.945
He says he's innocent.

24:42.281 --> 24:46.385
And what do you think?
Or do you?

24:49.454 --> 24:52.291
I can't use
my reality to explain it.

24:57.429 --> 25:00.432
Yeah, El Segundo,
uh, Burbank, Simi.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.434
We've opened so many
new ones the past two years,

25:02.434 --> 25:04.569
I almost forgot
we already had one in Pomona.

25:04.569 --> 25:07.773
Yeah, I've-I've seen
the billboards all over town.

25:07.773 --> 25:08.974
Congratulations.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.442
Yeah, thanks.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.010
You know, it didn't take
a genius to figure out

25:12.010 --> 25:13.445
that auto accidents
were the niche.

25:13.445 --> 25:14.980
The further away
people need to live for work

25:14.980 --> 25:16.515
because of real estate prices,

25:16.515 --> 25:18.750
the more they're going
to be driving in their car.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.018
The more they're
driving in their car,

25:20.018 --> 25:21.586
more accidents
they're going to have.

25:21.586 --> 25:23.088
It's just... it's just
fucking science, right?

25:23.088 --> 25:25.857
Yeah. It's fantastic,
man. Congrats.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.759
Yeah. No, hey, and-and you, too.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.661
Congratulations. Freedom!

25:29.661 --> 25:31.530
Right?

25:32.431 --> 25:34.566
Anyway, uh,
I'm glad you reached out.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.337
Yeah. Um...

25:40.172 --> 25:42.374
You know, I didn't want
to make any assumptions,

25:42.374 --> 25:43.942
uh...

25:43.942 --> 25:47.312
about anything, really, but...

25:48.547 --> 25:50.048
...you know, I've been
making the rounds

25:50.048 --> 25:51.850
at the law firms, and...

25:51.850 --> 25:53.752
...with my...

25:54.986 --> 25:57.756
...baggage, there's not a lot
of options out there for me.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.391
So I wanted to reach out to you

25:59.391 --> 26:03.662
because I know that you know
that I know the law,

26:03.662 --> 26:07.366
and anything that
I don't know, I can learn.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.769
Yeah. No, Danny, I...
I remember you.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.006
Do you remember what
you said when you found out

26:15.006 --> 26:17.109
I was prosecuting your case?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.944
This is before Marcella
took it away from me,

26:18.944 --> 26:20.479
that high-handed bitch.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.385
You know, anything
I said back then...

26:26.385 --> 26:27.953
And keep in mind,
this came from,

26:27.953 --> 26:29.388
like, six or seven
people secondhand,

26:29.388 --> 26:30.689
so I'm talking like,
a whole courthouse's worth

26:30.689 --> 26:32.557
of the telephone game here.

26:32.557 --> 26:35.694
But it was basically,
"If Frank's in the chair,

26:35.694 --> 26:38.296
"then we're golden,
because that dumb shit

26:38.296 --> 26:40.699
couldn't convict
John Wilkes Booth."

26:44.069 --> 26:45.537
Even still,

26:45.537 --> 26:47.439
there's part of me that
would love to have you

26:47.439 --> 26:49.975
grinding away in the basement
for 28 bucks an hour,

26:49.975 --> 26:52.110
but the rest of me,

26:52.110 --> 26:54.179
I wouldn't validate your parking

26:54.179 --> 26:56.114
if you had a fucking car.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.588
Hey.

27:03.588 --> 27:04.923
What are you doing here?

27:04.923 --> 27:07.793
I'm picking you up.
You see Frank?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.094
Yep.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.362
- He giving you a job?
- Nope.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.098
Yeah, of course
he's not. Come on.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.699
It was worth a shot.

27:14.699 --> 27:16.568
No, it really wasn't.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.003
There's just no universe

27:18.003 --> 27:19.104
in which he wasn't
just bringing you in

27:19.104 --> 27:20.372
to see the look on your face

27:20.372 --> 27:22.474
when he told you
to go fuck yourself.

27:23.341 --> 27:25.110
Tell me how this is better
than me taking the bus?

27:25.110 --> 27:26.678
Well, because I brought snacks.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.847
- Oh.
- Oh.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.415
Oh, and also,

27:30.415 --> 27:32.617
we got to go by Alex's
old apartment building

27:32.617 --> 27:35.821
and talk to the super
who remembers them both.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.155
Both who?

27:37.155 --> 27:39.424
Her and that
Dr. Paul Halliwell guy,

27:39.424 --> 27:40.992
the pill mill drug dealer?

27:40.992 --> 27:43.528
Lived across the hall from her.

27:43.528 --> 27:46.097
And he remembers
them both together?

27:46.097 --> 27:47.699
He saw them together?

27:47.699 --> 27:49.668
Well, we're going to see.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.708
Hey, get that glove
compartment, will you?

27:59.377 --> 28:02.113
- Oh.
- Oh, shit.

28:02.113 --> 28:04.349
- Goldfish.
- Yes.

28:04.349 --> 28:07.118
Do they give you
Goldfish on the bus, Dan?

28:07.118 --> 28:08.553
Oh, my God.

28:08.553 --> 28:10.455
No, they do not.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.090
So we're like,
"That's terrible,"

28:12.090 --> 28:13.458
but it also sounds
like the contractor

28:13.458 --> 28:15.093
was very inexperienced,
and that was

28:15.093 --> 28:16.161
- most of the problem.
- Right.

28:16.161 --> 28:17.762
She's nodding,

28:17.762 --> 28:20.365
agrees she should have
vetted the company better,

28:20.365 --> 28:24.269
but then she says
the second company she hired,

28:24.269 --> 28:25.737
they were very experienced,

28:25.737 --> 28:28.373
and then launches into
this whole thing about

28:28.373 --> 28:29.941
how she had all
these problems with them.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.277
Okay. Yeah. Run away, run away.

28:32.277 --> 28:33.745
So it was the classic,

28:33.745 --> 28:35.514
if you meet an asshole,
they're an asshole.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.016
If you meet assholes all day,
you're an asshole.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.352
Mm-hmm. The asshole. Yeah.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.487
She's the asshole.

28:44.356 --> 28:47.759
Anyway, how are you?

28:49.928 --> 28:51.997
Um, you know,

28:51.997 --> 28:54.232
I'm-I'm okay.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.337
Uh, it's just...

29:00.372 --> 29:03.041
So much has been, um,

29:03.041 --> 29:05.110
coming up for me lately?

29:05.110 --> 29:08.146
Like, coming back to me, um...

29:08.146 --> 29:11.750
You know, like, just
memories and emotions,

29:11.750 --> 29:16.821
and, uh, I feel like
I'm rethinking everything.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.225
And...

29:27.232 --> 29:29.000
I...

29:29.000 --> 29:31.970
just, I... just love you.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.006
So...

29:35.006 --> 29:36.875
I just wanted to...

29:36.875 --> 29:37.976
say that.

29:37.976 --> 29:40.211
I love you, too.

29:43.381 --> 29:44.816
- Aw.
- Mwah.

29:51.795 --> 29:53.597
You know how many
codefendants were on my case?

29:53.597 --> 29:55.165
How's there anything left
to even talk about?

29:55.165 --> 29:56.866
Well, South Bixel
Street's an angle,

29:56.866 --> 29:58.401
what you got up to
when you lived there.

29:58.401 --> 30:00.403
I don't know, that's...

30:00.403 --> 30:02.005
that was, like, 16 years ago.

30:02.005 --> 30:03.440
It was a long time ago.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.741
Statute of limitations.
Long time ago, so...

30:04.741 --> 30:07.077
There's no
statute of limitations

30:07.077 --> 30:08.411
on what we're talking about.

30:08.411 --> 30:11.748
Yeah, which is what?

30:11.748 --> 30:13.316
You and Alex Forrest,

30:13.316 --> 30:16.653
and why your fingerprints
were found in her apartment.

30:18.622 --> 30:21.791
Uh, well, we were friends.

30:21.791 --> 30:23.893
Were you friends
when she was killed?

30:24.861 --> 30:26.196
Fuck...

30:26.196 --> 30:27.397
When you broke your lease
and skipped out,

30:27.397 --> 30:28.398
did you ever see her again?

30:28.398 --> 30:30.533
You keep in contact?

30:30.533 --> 30:32.202
Uh, uh...

30:32.202 --> 30:33.637
Why not?

30:34.437 --> 30:36.006
I don't know.

30:37.307 --> 30:39.743
Or I-I-I do, but I don't know...

30:39.743 --> 30:41.244
I don't know...

30:41.244 --> 30:43.313
I-I don't... I...

30:43.313 --> 30:45.382
I don't know how
to describe her.

30:45.382 --> 30:47.017
How she was, um,

30:47.017 --> 30:49.252
which she wasn't at first.

30:49.252 --> 30:51.354
She was great at first. She...

30:51.354 --> 30:54.491
She knew so many
random, funny things,

30:54.491 --> 30:56.192
had such a smart
take on the world.

30:56.192 --> 30:57.661
Were you lovers?

30:58.995 --> 31:01.197
Did she want to be lovers?

31:01.197 --> 31:03.533
Uh, uh, I don't know
what she wanted.

31:07.937 --> 31:11.274
Uh, no, that's...

31:11.274 --> 31:12.909
that's not true.

31:14.477 --> 31:17.814
We liked all the same things.
Or I thought we did.

31:17.814 --> 31:19.382
And-and then...

31:19.382 --> 31:21.317
And then I-I realized,
no, I like things.

31:21.317 --> 31:23.687
And then she liked things
because I liked them.

31:23.687 --> 31:26.256
You know, she-she'd,
she'd like things

31:26.256 --> 31:27.891
it wouldn't even
make sense for her to like.

31:27.891 --> 31:29.092
Uh...

31:29.092 --> 31:31.061
You know, one night I laughed,

31:31.061 --> 31:33.196
and then she laughed, and...

31:33.196 --> 31:34.931
But it was not her laugh,
it was mine.

31:34.931 --> 31:38.234
She was not...
And not-not teasing me,

31:38.234 --> 31:40.870
exactly like me.

31:40.870 --> 31:42.338
I can still hear it.

31:42.338 --> 31:44.874
And-and...

31:44.874 --> 31:48.344
when I asked, she acted
like I was crazy for asking.

31:48.344 --> 31:49.579
Uh...

31:49.579 --> 31:51.548
Just so many things like that.

31:51.548 --> 31:53.450
She would, she would always

31:53.450 --> 31:54.784
make fun of me
having bad handwriting,

31:54.784 --> 31:56.486
even for a doctor.
She'd say it was

31:56.486 --> 31:58.088
because I was left-handed.

31:58.088 --> 32:00.724
I was always smearing ink.
And I was over at her place,

32:00.724 --> 32:03.993
she was writing a list,
and she was a lefty now.

32:03.993 --> 32:07.097
And she-she saw me seeing her,

32:07.097 --> 32:08.798
and she smiled at me, and...

32:08.798 --> 32:10.700
and... just...

32:11.568 --> 32:14.771
I-I know it all sounds stupid, and...

32:14.771 --> 32:17.807
it-it really
did not feel stupid.

32:17.807 --> 32:20.043
It felt like...

32:21.444 --> 32:24.147
...like I was getting
swallowed up.

32:28.251 --> 32:30.687
Anyway, I don't even know
why we're talking about this,

32:30.687 --> 32:33.389
because a guy's in prison
for killing her, I thought.

32:33.389 --> 32:35.625
What happened to that?

32:39.229 --> 32:40.764
Okay, not a jilted lover.

32:40.764 --> 32:43.566
Not a lover at all
of the ladies.

32:43.566 --> 32:46.102
But there's more than enough
there without any of that.

32:46.102 --> 32:49.339
Victim lived across the hall
from an active drug operation.

32:49.339 --> 32:51.875
Dangerous addicts
had access to the floor.

32:51.875 --> 32:53.176
The head of
said operation's prints

32:53.176 --> 32:54.611
were found inside her apartment.

32:54.611 --> 32:56.546
And he knew she
worked for the D.A.

32:56.546 --> 32:57.881
In fact, he admitted

32:57.881 --> 32:59.482
that she threatened
him with exposure.

32:59.482 --> 33:00.750
That's a pretty good
opening paragraph.

33:00.750 --> 33:02.819
Viable alternate
suspects with motive.

33:02.819 --> 33:05.155
You still remember how to
fill out your own paperwork?

33:05.155 --> 33:07.357
Excuse me, sir.

33:07.357 --> 33:10.426
I have filled out many
new trial applications

33:10.426 --> 33:12.061
while I was a guest
of the state.

33:12.061 --> 33:14.464
- Just none of them were for me.
- All right, all right.

33:16.699 --> 33:18.701
You know what else
I've been thinking about?

33:18.701 --> 33:22.472
What Brooker's gonna do
when you get a new trial?

33:23.373 --> 33:25.308
When the Longhorns
beat USC in '06,

33:25.308 --> 33:27.744
he broke his coffee table.

33:29.179 --> 33:31.714
- Conchita Lewis.
- Hmm?

33:31.714 --> 33:34.384
She ever talk to you
after the trial?

33:34.384 --> 33:35.985
Oh, no.

33:35.985 --> 33:39.155
But not a lot of people
wanted to talk to me back then.

33:39.155 --> 33:41.624
Uh, how come?

33:42.525 --> 33:43.760
I always wonder
what happened there.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.529
Why she chose to side with Ruiz.

33:47.597 --> 33:49.465
I thought about reaching
out to her while I was...

33:49.465 --> 33:51.201
But...

33:52.669 --> 33:54.904
Anyway, I think
I should do that now.

33:54.904 --> 33:56.339
Yeah.

33:56.339 --> 33:58.241
Well, that's all you, buddy.

34:02.312 --> 34:03.513
Hello?

34:03.513 --> 34:05.682
She just told me
to be back at 11:00.

34:05.682 --> 34:07.116
I'm not actually even sure

34:07.116 --> 34:08.384
who it is I'm supposed
to be meeting with.

34:08.384 --> 34:09.919
Give me a minute. I'll find out.

34:09.919 --> 34:11.788
Thank you.

34:18.061 --> 34:19.062
He's here.

34:19.062 --> 34:20.230
Yeah. Okay.

34:23.132 --> 34:26.269
Gagan, Ollen, Bibb.
How may I direct your call?

34:30.773 --> 34:33.509
Art, am I right?

34:36.045 --> 34:37.981
Jorge?

34:40.817 --> 34:43.720
I had no idea that
you worked at this firm.

34:45.388 --> 34:47.457
You're probably a partner here,
aren't you? That's great.

34:47.457 --> 34:49.292
Head of litigation, man.
It is great.

34:49.292 --> 34:51.527
But it's also why I didn't know
you were in the building

34:51.527 --> 34:53.062
the first time around
until you were gone.

34:54.230 --> 34:55.198
I want to catch up,

34:55.198 --> 34:56.833
find out how you're doing.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.869
But first, you... you really
looking to be a paralegal?

34:59.869 --> 35:01.671
Yeah, I am.

35:01.671 --> 35:04.641
Well, okay, then.
Welcome aboard.

35:04.641 --> 35:06.643
I mean, duh.
Or-or you got other offers.

35:06.643 --> 35:08.945
Well, what are they?
We'll-we'll be competitive.

35:08.945 --> 35:11.381
I do not.

35:11.381 --> 35:12.682
Well, shit, what other firms

35:12.682 --> 35:13.883
were dumb enough
to pass you up, then?

35:13.883 --> 35:15.718
I need names, because obviously

35:15.718 --> 35:17.553
they must be making all kinds
of other dumb mistakes

35:17.553 --> 35:19.689
I can capitalize on.

35:21.224 --> 35:24.294
You can tell me while we go
deal with your start paperwork.

35:24.294 --> 35:26.095
Come on.

35:26.095 --> 35:27.997
Jorge.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.901
Thank you.

35:31.901 --> 35:33.636
Of course.

35:33.636 --> 35:36.572
Thank you. For back then.

35:38.441 --> 35:40.310
I just got out of your way.

35:46.482 --> 35:47.617
Detective.

35:47.617 --> 35:50.053
Uh, please, could you, please,

35:50.053 --> 35:52.889
sign my grand jury
subpoenas, please?

35:52.889 --> 35:54.958
Why don't you
ask Jorge to do it?

35:54.958 --> 35:56.659
Oh, you let
Jorge make decisions?

35:56.659 --> 35:57.927
I-I'm so sorry. I wasn't aware.

35:57.927 --> 35:59.696
Just...

36:01.297 --> 36:02.465
You know, got to hand it to you.

36:02.465 --> 36:04.000
You seem pretty calm.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.668
Here I was, wondering
how much you were regretting

36:05.668 --> 36:07.270
sticking your neck out
for my old lady case.

36:07.270 --> 36:10.073
Leyva asked me to be there.

36:10.073 --> 36:13.343
You wanted Jorge, you got Jorge.
Why are you busting my balls?

36:13.343 --> 36:15.078
I'm just backstopping him.

36:15.078 --> 36:16.879
"When it goes
to trial, I'll lead."

36:16.879 --> 36:18.147
That's you backstopping him?

36:18.147 --> 36:20.216
Whatever I said,
I said to support Jorge.

36:20.216 --> 36:22.752
Well, nobody bought it,
including you.

36:24.420 --> 36:26.422
Anyway, so it turns out

36:26.422 --> 36:29.726
the junkie fuck who beat up
all the old ladies has a dad

36:29.726 --> 36:31.694
who owns all
these pay-for-parking lots,

36:31.694 --> 36:33.763
and guess who
he hired for the defense.

36:34.731 --> 36:36.966
Rolando Cabral.

36:36.966 --> 36:38.701
Right?

36:40.236 --> 36:43.740
So maybe you want to
reconsider grabbing lead,

36:43.740 --> 36:44.907
not just because
Jorge deserves a shot

36:44.907 --> 36:46.442
but because, I don't know,

36:46.442 --> 36:49.912
Cabral never
destroyed Jorge in court.

37:07.663 --> 37:09.165
Hey. What are we doing?

37:09.165 --> 37:10.366
Talking.

37:10.366 --> 37:12.235
Just us this time.

37:12.235 --> 37:13.936
Whatever.

37:13.936 --> 37:15.872
I'm gonna water my squash.

37:16.773 --> 37:18.274
You know, in all
the ways of this world

37:18.274 --> 37:19.809
that we did not make,

37:19.809 --> 37:22.345
I ever do anything
specific to you,

37:22.345 --> 37:24.147
specifically, to make you

37:24.147 --> 37:26.716
not respect me?
I mean specifically.

37:27.884 --> 37:29.352
So when it's two guys

37:29.352 --> 37:30.653
who did the job...

37:30.653 --> 37:32.955
Fine. Maybe you
deserve more slack

37:32.955 --> 37:34.891
than I cut you the other day,
and maybe I could say that

37:34.891 --> 37:36.325
because he's not standing
in front of me

37:36.325 --> 37:37.593
with his big fucking face.

37:37.593 --> 37:39.162
- Okay.
- What? I never liked him.

37:39.162 --> 37:41.230
I'm going to like him now?
I who like no one?

37:41.230 --> 37:42.999
It's just not irrelevant,
that's all.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.133
And I didn't go after him

37:44.133 --> 37:46.002
because I didn't
like him, Mikey.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.503
- The facts presented
themselves to me...
- I know, I know.

37:47.503 --> 37:48.638
If it had been me,
I would have done

37:48.638 --> 37:50.039
everything the same as you did.

37:50.039 --> 37:51.174
We just saw things
differently, is all.

37:51.174 --> 37:52.375
Fuck, yeah, we did.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.177
And all those years
of kissing lawyer ass

37:54.177 --> 37:55.678
worked out pretty goddamn well
for you till they didn't.

37:55.678 --> 37:57.046
Wouldn't change
what I did either.

37:57.046 --> 37:58.347
Yeah? I bet you
would like to retire

37:58.347 --> 37:59.749
instead of getting forced out.

37:59.749 --> 38:01.250
And why weren't you
able to do that again?

38:01.250 --> 38:02.585
That's a separate issue
from if he killed her,

38:02.585 --> 38:03.886
because I know he didn't.

38:03.886 --> 38:04.921
You want some cucumbers?

38:04.921 --> 38:06.722
Persian, seedless.

38:06.722 --> 38:08.024
I'll slice them up,

38:08.024 --> 38:09.158
throw a little
olive oil on them,

38:09.158 --> 38:10.726
a little lime juice, red onion.

38:10.726 --> 38:12.061
Listen, I'm just going
to talk about food

38:12.061 --> 38:13.696
right now 'cause
I'm done talking about

38:13.696 --> 38:15.198
- the other thing.
- Dan's not a murderer, Earl.

38:15.198 --> 38:17.433
He's a liar, Mikey.

38:17.433 --> 38:19.669
So you'll never, ever
be able to say for sure

38:19.669 --> 38:21.337
what the fuck else he is.

38:26.342 --> 38:27.910
Well, now I'm confused.

38:28.678 --> 38:30.046
What?

38:30.947 --> 38:33.783
You asked me did
I want some cucumbers,

38:33.783 --> 38:35.218
and I'm not
getting any cucumbers.

38:35.218 --> 38:36.953
I'm not giving you
any of my cucumbers,

38:36.953 --> 38:38.955
you fucking neckbone. That was
just a figure of speech.

38:40.556 --> 38:41.858
You could have a beer

38:41.858 --> 38:44.093
and shut the fuck up.
How about that?

38:44.093 --> 38:45.194
Done.

38:46.162 --> 38:48.764
<i>Who do they think
has the leisure time to</i>

38:48.764 --> 38:51.067
wait at home for
a five-hour window, or more,

38:51.067 --> 38:53.436
- on a weekday?
- Um, you do.

38:53.436 --> 38:55.138
It's not my home.

38:55.138 --> 38:56.973
Are we going to that
consignment place on Ventura,

38:56.973 --> 38:58.574
or just Wertz Brothers?

38:58.574 --> 39:00.376
Uh, if we have time. Why?

39:00.376 --> 39:02.445
I'm just timing
my trips to the pisser.

39:02.445 --> 39:04.147
What are we looking for?

39:04.147 --> 39:06.549
Um, an end table
and a bench for the hall.

39:06.549 --> 39:09.051
Why a window? A window of time?

39:09.051 --> 39:12.188
Because it has a frame.
Because it closes.

39:12.188 --> 39:15.258
Well, so do doors.
Why not a door of time?

39:15.258 --> 39:16.826
We are leaving.

39:16.826 --> 39:19.795
Go to the bathroom.

39:19.795 --> 39:21.164
- Mama?
- Yeah?

39:21.164 --> 39:23.199
Gas and electric
will be here between

39:23.199 --> 39:25.868
10:00 and 3:00
to trim the trees.

39:25.868 --> 39:27.170
Maybe.
- We live in hope.

39:27.170 --> 39:30.806
The gate is unlocked.
The key is here.

39:30.806 --> 39:32.575
- Got it.
- When they come,

39:32.575 --> 39:34.544
they're going to prop the gate
open to get their equipment in,

39:34.544 --> 39:37.113
and when they leave, they might
close it, but they won't.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.515
- Hmm.
- If you let Quincy out,

39:39.515 --> 39:41.717
he will run off.

39:41.717 --> 39:43.653
So if he has to go potty,
I do what?

39:43.653 --> 39:45.021
You take him out in the yard

39:45.021 --> 39:46.556
- on leash.
- Okay.

39:46.556 --> 39:48.558
When they leave, you need to

39:48.558 --> 39:50.293
close the gate and lock it.

39:50.293 --> 39:52.094
- Then you may take Quincy out.
- Okay.

39:52.094 --> 39:54.830
Ellen gets off the bus
between 2:30 and 2:45.

39:54.830 --> 39:55.831
I know that.

39:55.831 --> 39:56.999
Grab her,

39:56.999 --> 39:59.001
and then, please,
give her a snack

39:59.001 --> 40:01.804
that is not mac and cheese.

40:01.804 --> 40:03.239
Okay.

40:03.239 --> 40:05.241
10:00 to 3:00.
The key lives in the bowl.

40:05.241 --> 40:08.811
Don't let Quincy out
until the gate is locked.

40:08.811 --> 40:13.182
And give Ellen mac and cheese.

40:15.651 --> 40:17.520
You look lovely, Bethy.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.921
So fresh.

40:18.921 --> 40:20.990
- Ugh, no, I don't.
- Well, you look like

40:20.990 --> 40:23.192
a flower. You do to me.

40:23.192 --> 40:24.927
- You're fresh.
- She is fresh.

40:24.927 --> 40:27.096
She takes liberties
you would not believe.

40:27.096 --> 40:29.899
Stop.
- Are you ready?

40:29.899 --> 40:32.068
Maybe one time I'd like to go

40:32.068 --> 40:33.703
help pick out antiques.

40:33.703 --> 40:35.771
No, no, Mom, you don't
have Daddy's eye.

40:35.771 --> 40:37.440
My beady flinty eye.

40:37.440 --> 40:41.244
Your surprisingly eclectic
and beautiful eye

40:41.244 --> 40:43.246
for someone who is friends
with Caspar Weinberger.

40:43.246 --> 40:45.047
"Friendly."
You always say friends.

40:45.047 --> 40:46.849
There's a difference.

40:46.849 --> 40:49.518
Is there, though?
- No, there really is.

40:52.521 --> 40:53.656
Rolando Cabral.

40:53.656 --> 40:55.491
What are you doing?

40:56.759 --> 40:58.060
I-I heard there was

40:58.060 --> 40:59.428
a dartboard with my face on it

40:59.428 --> 41:01.063
- in here somewhere.
- No, you didn't.

41:01.063 --> 41:03.366
- Oh, didn't I?
- No.

41:03.366 --> 41:04.500
Is there?

41:04.500 --> 41:05.635
Never seen it.

41:05.635 --> 41:08.170
Wait, d... Do you even know

41:08.170 --> 41:10.606
why there would be one?

41:10.606 --> 41:11.674
Has he told you?

41:11.674 --> 41:13.276
Wow.

41:13.276 --> 41:16.345
I mean, I wouldn't want
to relive that shit either,

41:16.345 --> 41:17.513
but still.

41:17.513 --> 41:19.949
Nando Winston.

41:19.949 --> 41:21.851
Mid-level coke guy on the rise,

41:21.851 --> 41:23.452
not a care in the world
other than the fact

41:23.452 --> 41:26.155
that he's Black and
he's driving a 7 Series.

41:26.155 --> 41:29.058
So two hair-bags pull him over.

41:29.058 --> 41:31.894
First, they say
Nando failed to signal.

41:31.894 --> 41:33.796
Obviously a pretextual stop.

41:33.796 --> 41:35.564
Then they say Nando,
who fully knows

41:35.564 --> 41:37.533
he's got a loaded
nine millimeter under the seat,

41:37.533 --> 41:40.870
consented to these two
motherfuckers searching his car.

41:40.870 --> 41:43.039
<i>Okay, well, you being worried
that I'm making you look bad</i>

41:43.039 --> 41:44.674
in front of your
Navy buddy you've known

41:44.674 --> 41:46.375
for less than five minutes
is not a good reason for me

41:46.375 --> 41:49.078
to buy a $2,600 antique
that's not an antique.

41:49.078 --> 41:50.479
It's the man's trade.

41:50.479 --> 41:52.281
You were second-guessing him
in the field

41:52.281 --> 41:54.417
where he's established
and where he's known.

41:54.417 --> 41:56.218
Yeah, he's probably
known as a crook

41:56.218 --> 41:59.288
who tries to pass off
thrift store shit as antique.

41:59.288 --> 42:01.057
<i>So these Sherlock Holmeses</i>

42:01.057 --> 42:03.859
search and find this gun,
at which point they say

42:03.859 --> 42:05.561
Nando tells them it's his.

42:05.561 --> 42:09.231
No actual shit in the alleged
statement is "That's my gun."

42:09.231 --> 42:11.834
They call it an excited
utterance prior to arrest

42:11.834 --> 42:13.402
for illegal
possession of a weapon,

42:13.402 --> 42:15.738
which is adorable,
and as long as we're dreaming,

42:15.738 --> 42:17.006
I'd like a pony.

42:17.006 --> 42:17.973
<i>You embarrassed him.</i>

42:17.973 --> 42:19.008
An antique end table

42:19.008 --> 42:20.843
has single spot screws,

42:20.843 --> 42:22.111
and every one of
those screws is different

42:22.111 --> 42:23.746
because they're handmade.

42:23.746 --> 42:25.047
But I should not point that out

42:25.047 --> 42:26.315
to the guy trying to
sell me a table

42:26.315 --> 42:27.850
that has
factory-manufactured screws

42:27.850 --> 42:31.754
with tapered ends?
Um, okay, got it.

42:32.822 --> 42:34.857
Oh, at last, a place

42:34.857 --> 42:36.525
to rest a drink
on this end of the couch,

42:36.525 --> 42:39.362
instead of on the floor where
the dog can knock it over.

42:39.362 --> 42:41.130
Please, he could knock
a drink off the roof

42:41.130 --> 42:42.565
if he was motivated.

42:42.565 --> 42:43.966
Let's find out.

42:43.966 --> 42:46.736
Let's wave some vermouth
at this thorny quest.

42:46.736 --> 42:50.606
Uh, let's you guys go home and
spill drinks on your own rugs.

42:51.807 --> 42:53.275
Where is the dog?

42:55.144 --> 42:56.379
<i>So I immediately</i>

42:56.379 --> 42:58.047
take it to trial.
Why do I do that?

42:58.047 --> 42:59.949
One, the cops are lying.

42:59.949 --> 43:03.018
But two,
your boss is feeling cocky.

43:03.018 --> 43:05.054
He's on one of his
yearlong winning streaks.

43:05.054 --> 43:06.222
He's running up the numbers.

43:06.222 --> 43:07.957
No way is he ready for <i>moi.</i>

43:07.957 --> 43:10.393
<i>Quincy? (smacks lips)</i>

43:25.775 --> 43:27.209
Quincy?

43:30.279 --> 43:31.881
- Hi.
- No one was there waiting.

43:31.881 --> 43:32.915
You were early.

43:32.915 --> 43:34.984
I was about to come out.

43:34.984 --> 43:37.086
Can you run upstairs
and find Nana and Papa?

43:37.086 --> 43:38.687
And your laundry's on your bed.

43:38.687 --> 43:40.623
Please put it all away,
but not in the same drawer.

43:40.623 --> 43:42.291
Okay.

44:11.086 --> 44:13.088
Quincy!

44:31.040 --> 44:33.576
Help!

44:34.643 --> 44:35.878
Help!

44:35.878 --> 44:37.179
Bethy? Beth?

44:37.179 --> 44:38.681
What is... Oh, my God!

44:41.150 --> 44:42.184
No, Mom!

44:42.184 --> 44:43.953
Here, here!

44:43.953 --> 44:46.755
Here. Oh, God.

44:46.755 --> 44:48.360
Help her!

44:50.831 --> 44:53.300
Anyway, so the cops lied,
Dan looked like he was

44:53.300 --> 44:54.768
suborning perjury, and the jury

44:54.768 --> 44:57.972
walks Nando's ass out
the door in 42 minutes.

44:57.972 --> 44:59.340
Are we going to conduct
some business

44:59.340 --> 45:00.274
or are you just here
for story hour?

45:06.280 --> 45:07.915
<i>The Clarks brought him back.</i>

45:07.915 --> 45:11.785
They heard barking
and looked out,

45:11.785 --> 45:13.721
and there he was, in their yard.

45:14.688 --> 45:18.926
Don't know how long
he was loose for.

45:20.094 --> 45:21.896
The gate was closed.

45:21.896 --> 45:23.664
I know.

45:24.865 --> 45:26.166
You keep saying that.

45:26.166 --> 45:28.335
Well, I just don't
understand why she would

45:28.335 --> 45:31.372
close the gate if she didn't
know where Quincy was.

45:35.309 --> 45:37.711
Maybe she assumed she did.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.282
Or maybe she wasn't thinking,

45:41.282 --> 45:42.783
because, clearly, she'd already

45:42.783 --> 45:44.652
broken the seal for the day

45:44.652 --> 45:47.888
even though Ellen
wasn't even off the bus yet.

45:50.558 --> 45:53.160
Even if she was drunk,
it wouldn't make her cruel.

45:53.160 --> 45:56.397
She wouldn't turn into somebody
who didn't care about Quincy.

45:57.331 --> 45:58.899
She couldn't
get out of the pool, Dan.

45:58.899 --> 46:00.634
She was something.

46:01.902 --> 46:03.404
- Yeah.
- Even if...

46:03.404 --> 46:05.072
he can't admit that,

46:05.072 --> 46:06.574
we can.

46:08.108 --> 46:11.345
Mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.

46:29.530 --> 46:31.231
<i>She was here.</i>

46:31.231 --> 46:33.467
<i>MIKE Oh, come on.</i>

46:33.467 --> 46:35.436
<i>And what's your
mother-in-law doing</i>

46:35.436 --> 46:36.804
<i>while Alex is in your house?</i>

46:36.804 --> 46:38.205
I don't know.

46:38.205 --> 46:40.374
But it's not like
we've never seen somebody

46:40.374 --> 46:43.611
go from destroying property
to destroying people, right?

46:43.611 --> 46:45.746
<i>But why? Why would Alex do that?</i>

46:45.746 --> 46:47.247
I don't know.

46:47.247 --> 46:48.582
If it makes sense to her,

46:48.582 --> 46:49.984
does it have
to make sense to us?

46:49.984 --> 46:51.385
<i>So, what, we're going from</i>

46:51.385 --> 46:53.954
<i>floor stripper
on your car to this?</i>

46:53.954 --> 46:55.389
<i>I don't know.</i>

46:55.389 --> 46:58.292
<i>I'll go talk to her. Fuck.</i>

46:59.059 --> 47:00.394
<i>Okay, go be with Beth and them.</i>

47:00.394 --> 47:02.396
<i>They need you.</i>

47:13.374 --> 47:15.442
Sorry about that.
He usually settles

47:15.442 --> 47:16.944
a little quicker than that.

47:16.944 --> 47:17.945
Don't worry about it.

47:17.945 --> 47:19.847
He's very cute. Zeke?

47:19.847 --> 47:21.215
Uh, Ziggy.

47:21.215 --> 47:23.050
I was all ready
to change his name,

47:23.050 --> 47:25.019
even though they say you
never change a rescue's name.

47:25.019 --> 47:28.956
But then the longer we had him,
the more he just was a Ziggy.

47:28.956 --> 47:30.758
Whatever a Ziggy is.

47:30.758 --> 47:32.893
Oh, it's German.
Short for "Zigmund."

47:32.893 --> 47:35.262
It means, uh,
"victorious protector."

47:35.262 --> 47:38.432
Here I was thinking
it was just a Bowie song.

47:50.344 --> 47:51.779
You know, we can totally
do this over the phone.

47:51.779 --> 47:54.682
I'm the one
who told you to come over.

47:54.682 --> 47:56.550
It's just I, uh,

47:56.550 --> 48:00.020
don't know what this is
or how to do this.

48:00.020 --> 48:01.488
I-I, uh...

48:01.488 --> 48:03.624
I was fine being done
with it, with all of it.

48:03.624 --> 48:05.826
Because you thought
I was guilty.

48:06.927 --> 48:09.496
Because you made me think
that you were.

48:11.765 --> 48:13.434
Not at first.

48:14.435 --> 48:17.104
I mean, that's Dan Gallagher.

48:17.104 --> 48:18.439
I'd worked with you for years,

48:18.439 --> 48:21.942
speaking up for people,
ruined people.

48:21.942 --> 48:24.111
I'm thinking to myself,

48:24.111 --> 48:25.846
"Could you betray them?

48:25.846 --> 48:28.115
"Could you have
dealt death to someone

48:28.115 --> 48:29.983
with everything that you know?"

48:29.983 --> 48:33.454
I didn't believe it. I couldn't.

48:34.922 --> 48:37.524
And then I heard
about your defense.

48:38.425 --> 48:40.961
That you were
putting it all on her.

48:40.961 --> 48:42.362
That was a strategy.

48:42.362 --> 48:43.864
Someone gets assaulted.

48:43.864 --> 48:45.299
What did they say to make
the guy go after them?

48:45.299 --> 48:46.767
They must have been drunk.

48:46.767 --> 48:49.036
Someone gets raped.
What were they wearing?

48:49.036 --> 48:50.270
Why did they leave with him?

48:50.270 --> 48:51.839
Someone gets robbed and shot.

48:51.839 --> 48:53.707
What were they doing
in that neighborhood

48:53.707 --> 48:55.709
that time of day? Must have
been a drug deal gone wrong.

48:55.709 --> 48:58.011
It was your thing
that you always said,

48:58.011 --> 48:59.780
that I always repeated.

48:59.780 --> 49:01.682
I think I told
every single newbie

49:01.682 --> 49:04.685
at the VSB at some point.
I'm sure I told her.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.721
When they don't have the law,
they argue the facts.

49:07.721 --> 49:09.490
When they don't have the facts,
they argue the law.

49:09.490 --> 49:11.058
When they don't have either,
they blame the victim.

49:12.292 --> 49:14.995
The guilty
always blame the victim.

49:21.135 --> 49:23.137
Is that what you still think?

49:24.671 --> 49:26.907
I don't think about you, Dan.

49:26.907 --> 49:30.144
Or no, I do. A little,

49:30.144 --> 49:33.580
when I remember how well
I used to think I knew people.

49:33.580 --> 49:35.649
Including myself.

49:45.125 --> 49:47.995
A while before she died,

49:47.995 --> 49:50.964
I received an unofficial
complaint about Alex.

49:51.965 --> 49:55.135
Inappropriate behavior towards
a criminal courts employee.

49:55.135 --> 49:58.839
I met with him and
his union rep off the record.

49:59.907 --> 50:02.576
He had rejected her,
and she had backed off,

50:02.576 --> 50:04.545
but only sort of.

50:04.545 --> 50:08.482
And he was afraid for
his job and about gossip.

50:08.482 --> 50:09.716
He had had an affair once,

50:09.716 --> 50:11.251
and his wife had
made it very clear

50:11.251 --> 50:12.586
that there would be
zero tolerance.

50:12.586 --> 50:14.822
Alex had not gotten ugly,

50:14.822 --> 50:17.391
and he was not looking
to have her disciplined.

50:17.391 --> 50:19.760
He was just trying
to get on the books

50:19.760 --> 50:21.962
with his side in case she did.

50:24.631 --> 50:26.967
- So she was stalking him?
- No.

50:26.967 --> 50:28.836
Harassing him, then.

50:28.836 --> 50:31.238
Enough to make him
want to come forward.

50:31.238 --> 50:32.873
Unofficially, off the record.

50:32.873 --> 50:34.541
Right.

50:34.541 --> 50:36.310
Which means that you
could have done anything

50:36.310 --> 50:38.045
that you wanted
with that information,

50:38.045 --> 50:40.681
including give it to me when
you knew how much I needed it.

50:40.681 --> 50:42.349
She was dead,
and someone killed her,

50:42.349 --> 50:44.651
and you wanted to
make that her fault!

50:45.853 --> 50:49.156
The guilty
always blame the victim.

51:08.108 --> 51:10.878
Who made the complaint,
Conchita?

51:12.646 --> 51:15.249
Please, after all
this time, just tell me.

51:22.089 --> 51:23.724
Gabriel Ibarra,

51:23.724 --> 51:27.227
the bailiff from courtroom M71.

51:33.533 --> 51:35.202
Ziggy really wants you to go.

51:57.457 --> 51:59.159
Hey, there.

52:01.128 --> 52:03.931
Mike Gerard.
I met you at Andolini's.

52:03.931 --> 52:06.500
Right. Hi.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.634
What are you doing here?

52:07.634 --> 52:09.736
Oh, I'm on my way home.

52:09.736 --> 52:11.338
Thought I'd talk to you.

52:12.706 --> 52:15.075
This is a beautiful building.

52:15.075 --> 52:17.644
I-I can't believe
they made it residential.

52:17.644 --> 52:19.780
You know, it started out
as a vaudeville house

52:19.780 --> 52:22.482
and a garment depot?

52:22.482 --> 52:23.684
Yeah, somebody said that.

52:23.684 --> 52:25.485
You live downtown?

52:25.485 --> 52:27.254
No. No, I don't like
to live where I work.

52:27.254 --> 52:28.722
Huh.

52:28.722 --> 52:30.457
That's what I like about it.

52:30.457 --> 52:32.259
Yeah, I got that.

52:33.093 --> 52:34.962
I just think we need
some separation.

52:34.962 --> 52:37.998
You know? The terrible
things we see on this job.

52:37.998 --> 52:40.133
Need a little distraction
now and again.

52:40.133 --> 52:41.268
That's what gets us

52:41.268 --> 52:43.303
into trouble sometimes, though.

52:43.303 --> 52:46.740
I mean, you spend all day
doing good for other people,

52:46.740 --> 52:49.309
you start to feeling like
if you want to get up to

52:49.309 --> 52:52.279
some shenanigans on your
own time, it's your business.

52:53.313 --> 52:55.082
And it is.

52:56.216 --> 52:57.851
You know, until it's not.

53:02.222 --> 53:04.124
You know, Dan Gallagher?

53:05.959 --> 53:07.728
I've known him a long time.

53:07.728 --> 53:09.229
Half his life.

53:09.229 --> 53:10.764
You know,

53:10.764 --> 53:14.868
he's a good man in
the most important ways,

53:14.868 --> 53:18.071
but he should
have left you alone.

53:18.071 --> 53:19.339
He knows that.

53:19.339 --> 53:21.074
Does he know that you're here?

53:22.542 --> 53:23.977
Does she know?

53:23.977 --> 53:26.947
Are you going to tell her?

53:28.215 --> 53:30.751
- No.
- Hmm.

53:31.785 --> 53:33.954
I don't think I'll have to.

53:36.990 --> 53:38.291
Anyway...

53:40.427 --> 53:42.662
Safe home, Mike.

53:44.131 --> 53:46.033
Wherever that is.

53:52.005 --> 53:53.607
Hey.

53:53.607 --> 53:55.442
How's she doing? Is she down?

53:57.577 --> 53:59.179
What about him? How is he?

54:03.784 --> 54:07.754
I've never seen him like...
whatever this is.

54:09.723 --> 54:12.292
I actually got him
to take a pill,

54:12.292 --> 54:13.827
that's how he is.

54:20.233 --> 54:21.735
Are you sick?

54:23.270 --> 54:24.971
You okay, baby?

54:32.879 --> 54:35.282
I have to tell you
something, Beth.

54:38.685 --> 54:41.188
Now? Does it have to be now?

54:43.423 --> 54:45.959
Yeah, I think it does.

54:53.958 --> 56:06.898

Oh, hey, I'm Beth.

56:08.399 --> 56:09.234
I'm the owner.

56:09.767 --> 56:11.469
I did the remodel myself,
so if you have any questions--

56:11.469 --> 56:12.470
I'll find you.
