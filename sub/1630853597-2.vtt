14:45.623 --> 14:47.887
What about the chemical plant
in the Cession?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.845
If the poison
is being manufactured there,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.760
we need to act.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.022
I can reach out to

14:54.719 --> 14:56.112

was with Alder.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.897
There are witches
on that Council.

shows up,

No. What is it?

26:52.567 --> 26:54.221
[coughs]

26:55.614 --> 26:57.180
Glad to see you haven't gone
completely soft.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.008
I didn't see Hearst in there.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.663
Listen. He's trying to leave.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.276
[chatter]

27:06.320 --> 27:07.843
Is that one Claude?

27:07.887 --> 27:09.671
Does it really matter?

27:09.715 --> 27:11.412
They should just number them.

27:11.455 --> 27:12.805
Make it easier on everyone.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.154
[laughs]

27:16.504 --> 27:18.071
I don't know how much more
of them I can take.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.550
Can I please
rip his face off now?

27:19.594 --> 27:21.683
You're gonna have
to get in line.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.036
Will we be serving dinner soon?

27:27.080 --> 27:29.343
Veal Prince Orlov
is unforgiving of delays.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.345
Well, we can't have that.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.347
Let me see
if I can move things along.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.441
Step aside, please.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.617
I'm afraid I can't do that,
General.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.532
If I let you in there, ma'am,

27:44.575 --> 27:46.708
I won't be on the President's
detail for long

27:46.752 --> 27:48.231
and there goes our surveillance.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.800
I see we chose the right soldier
for the job.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.323
Carry on.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.639
[helicopter engine whirring]

28:11.298 --> 28:13.213
-Is Hearst on there?
-I can't tell.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.130
We can't let him leave.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.045
He's not going anywhere.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.483
[growling]

28:48.291 --> 28:50.337
[explosion]

28:51.947 --> 28:52.992
[screams]

28:55.821 --> 28:57.823
[gasps]

29:00.826 --> 29:02.262
You're welcome.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.789
VP SILVER: I would like
to propose a toast

29:07.833 --> 29:10.009
to our lovely hostess.

29:10.052 --> 29:12.489
Thank you for a truly
enjoyable evening

29:12.533 --> 29:15.666
in celebration of the Washington
Historical Society.

29:15.710 --> 29:16.972
Cheers.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.321
ALL: Cheers.

29:18.365 --> 29:20.454
Thank you, all.

29:20.497 --> 29:23.370
And thank you for taking time
out of your schedule to be here.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.807
I know you've been very busy
with the new legislation.

29:25.851 --> 29:29.724
-Part of the job.
-Oh, Blanton is being modest.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.380
He's been working very hard
on this bill

29:33.423 --> 29:34.903
and it's gonna make
a world of difference.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.081
I know it's controversial
with your people

29:39.125 --> 29:40.779
and certainly not something
that could have happened

29:40.822 --> 29:42.258
during Alder's time,

29:42.302 --> 29:45.653
but I just think

29:45.696 --> 29:47.263
that we're all gonna
get along so much better

29:47.307 --> 29:49.570
when we don't have to worry
about the voting.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.355
Don't you?

29:52.399 --> 29:55.315
There are voting restrictions
in this bill?

29:57.143 --> 29:59.580
It's one of the things
that we're discussing, yes.

29:59.623 --> 30:02.670
You think we should fight
and die for this country

30:02.713 --> 30:04.672
but shouldn't have a say
in how it's being run?

30:04.715 --> 30:07.109
What I think is that,
for too long,

30:07.153 --> 30:09.590
witches have lived as
a separate society

30:09.633 --> 30:11.026
within this nation
and it's time for that

30:11.070 --> 30:12.767
to come to an end.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.334
And for that to happen smoothly,

30:14.377 --> 30:15.552
there needs to be
a system of checks

30:15.596 --> 30:16.771
and balances put in place.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.773
PRESIDENT WADE: Blanton.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.820
I do hope you're playing nice.

30:21.863 --> 30:24.300
I want to be perfectly clear

30:24.344 --> 30:26.302
and it's fitting
that I should be saying this

30:26.346 --> 30:28.827
in a room full of historians

30:28.870 --> 30:31.917
because I believe this
is going to be one of the most

30:31.960 --> 30:35.659
important moments
in the history of our nation.

30:35.703 --> 30:36.791
-Madame President--
-PRESIDENT WADE: I will not be

30:36.835 --> 30:38.793
signing the bill, Blanton.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.927
And if that legislation
comes to my desk,

30:41.970 --> 30:43.450
I will veto it.

30:45.452 --> 30:49.586
As the 45th elected President
of this nation,

30:49.630 --> 30:51.850
I will be working to ensure

30:51.893 --> 30:55.418
that the rights
of every US citizens,

30:55.462 --> 31:01.294
witch and non-witch,
are legally protected.

31:01.337 --> 31:05.776
It's been a long time coming

31:05.820 --> 31:07.387
but the time is now.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.739
Let's enjoy this dinner
I've been hearing so much about.

31:11.782 --> 31:13.262
Shall we?

31:19.878 --> 31:20.879
Hmm.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.665
We need to get out of here.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.797
-Now.
-We can pick up Khalida

31:26.841 --> 31:28.669
and head straight
for the Western border.

31:28.712 --> 31:31.106
We have to make sure the job
is done first.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.934
Are there any of them left?

31:32.978 --> 31:34.849
I can't see any.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.375
[gasps] Wait.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.812
If they take me,
get to Miss Brandt.

31:41.856 --> 31:45.947
Carry on with the drilling
and the hunt for the First Song.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.994
It's Hearst.
He's still alive.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.389
[chatters]

32:04.835 --> 32:07.621
I'm very sorry, everyone,
but a situation

32:07.664 --> 32:09.797
has arisen that requires
my immediate attention.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.755
Is it something
I should be concerned about?

32:11.799 --> 32:13.105
No, Madam President.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.671
All right then.

32:14.715 --> 32:15.759
We will talk tomorrow.

32:15.803 --> 32:16.978
Of course.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.328
And, uh, General,

32:19.372 --> 32:21.809
thank you very much
for a wonderful evening.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.507
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Vice President.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.987
Thank you.

32:29.556 --> 32:31.601
[steam hissing]

32:41.785 --> 32:42.830
[grunts]

32:45.050 --> 32:48.792
Well,
this is a pleasant surprise.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.272
Hi, doc.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.797
Remember me?

32:53.841 --> 32:55.799
[groans]

32:58.977 --> 33:00.239
What do we know?

33:01.283 --> 33:02.806
There was an incident

33:02.850 --> 33:03.764
at the chemical plant
in the Cession.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.505
Nothing confirmed.

33:05.548 --> 33:07.768
But there was a large explosion.

33:07.811 --> 33:08.856
Damn it.

33:11.119 --> 33:12.816
Any word on Abigail?

33:12.860 --> 33:15.776
There are no reports
of any US military personnel

33:15.819 --> 33:17.560
having been captured or killed.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.432
My sources are working
to find out more.

33:19.475 --> 33:20.911
PETRA: Keep me posted.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.654
The President made
her position clear,

33:24.698 --> 33:27.440
but just to be safe,
did Izadora finish her analysis?

33:27.483 --> 33:30.791
She did. Wade was sincere.
She is not Camarilla.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.837
Which I told you
from the very beginning.

33:34.838 --> 33:37.102
Kelly and I
might not see eye to eye,

33:37.145 --> 33:40.714
but that woman
has integrity to spare.

33:41.889 --> 33:43.891
What happened in that room
tonight, Mother?

33:43.934 --> 33:45.762
Please tell me
you didn't push her.

33:45.806 --> 33:48.809
[scoffs] Of course not.

33:48.852 --> 33:52.247
Kelly and I were rising through
the ranks at the same time.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.119
A witch and a civilian.

33:54.162 --> 33:58.601
Both Black women
and both a little stubborn.

33:58.645 --> 34:01.865
[chuckles] And at the time,
neither of us could see

34:01.909 --> 34:06.305
that we had far more
in common than not.

34:06.348 --> 34:11.049
But we've put that
to bed tonight. [chuckles]

34:11.092 --> 34:13.051
Just like that?

34:13.094 --> 34:15.879
Think of it this way, Petti.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.794
You didn't like Alder,

34:17.838 --> 34:20.101
but imagine the conversation

34:20.145 --> 34:22.669
you'd have with her now, hmm.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.019
One can always find common
ground

34:25.063 --> 34:26.847
over a glass of bourbon.

34:27.848 --> 34:30.590
Goodnight. [chuckles softly]

34:31.808 --> 34:33.288
[sighs]

34:33.332 --> 34:34.942
Wade is on our side.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.032
But that raises another problem.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.773
Uh-hmm.

34:39.816 --> 34:43.951
She just became the Camarilla's
number one target.

34:44.995 --> 34:49.304
[tense music playing]

34:49.348 --> 34:50.827
We ready to go?

34:52.612 --> 34:54.266
Would you rather talk
about the drilling

34:54.309 --> 34:55.745
or the First Song?

34:58.008 --> 35:00.663
You have no idea what
you're talking about, do you?

35:02.665 --> 35:05.103
[groans]

35:06.408 --> 35:08.062
Scylla?

35:12.936 --> 35:14.808
I keep sending it to her

35:14.851 --> 35:17.811
so that wherever she is,
it'll reach her

35:17.854 --> 35:19.900
and she'll know
that I'm looking for her

35:19.943 --> 35:21.162
and that I'll never give up.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.816
None of us will.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.514
I know it hasn't always
felt like this

35:25.558 --> 35:27.386
but we are in this together,

35:27.429 --> 35:29.344
and we are gonna find her.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.827
[siren wailing in the distance]

35:35.698 --> 35:36.743
Thank you, Tally.

35:40.007 --> 35:42.183
I noticed Blondie
isn't with you.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.837
Is she feeling all right?

35:45.055 --> 35:46.840
[groaning]

35:48.798 --> 35:51.801
[tense music playing]

36:09.732 --> 36:11.778
[pitch fork dings]

36:33.756 --> 36:36.803
[tense music playing]

36:55.822 --> 36:57.867
[breathing heavily]

37:04.700 --> 37:06.136
Hello, Penelope.

37:08.748 --> 37:09.923
Welcome back.

37:11.577 --> 37:12.795
Thank you?

37:16.103 --> 37:18.105
Where am I?

37:18.148 --> 37:19.715
You're at Fort Salem.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.283
You're home.

37:23.719 --> 37:24.764
Home?

37:26.113 --> 37:28.071
[screaming]

37:28.115 --> 37:30.030
[groans]

37:32.075 --> 37:34.600
[whimpering]

37:34.643 --> 37:37.646
[tense music playing]

37:40.780 --> 37:42.825
[panting]

37:49.963 --> 37:53.009
[ominous music playing]

38:15.380 --> 38:16.903
Where are the crickets?

38:23.866 --> 38:26.216
The wards will hold him.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.306
[footsteps approaching]

38:31.309 --> 38:34.747
I don't see Khalida,
but there are people here.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.315
A half dozen or more.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.055
It's the Marshals.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.796
How did they find us so fast?

38:40.840 --> 38:42.798
ADIL: I'll get Khalida.
They won't be able to see me.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.630
Adil, wait...

38:51.241 --> 38:54.723
[whistling sound playing]

39:02.383 --> 39:04.385
THE MARSHALL: [laughs]

39:20.314 --> 39:22.882
Goddess, they can see him.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.484
We need to go. Now!

39:59.527 --> 40:00.746
We're not leaving him alive.

40:00.789 --> 40:02.095
No. We don't have time.

40:03.313 --> 40:04.793
Come on!

40:07.796 --> 40:09.798
MAN: [laughs]

40:11.060 --> 40:14.107
[tense music playing]

40:34.040 --> 40:36.390
Mom?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.827
Raelle.

40:38.871 --> 40:41.003
You're sick.

40:41.047 --> 40:42.831
You need your rest.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.747
Sick?
What are you talking about?

40:50.926 --> 40:52.188
Never mind about that.

40:53.799 --> 40:57.324
Mother is going to take care
of you from now on.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.464
[theme music playing]
