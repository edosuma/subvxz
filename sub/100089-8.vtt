WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.472
So, this is how we're kicking
off Thanksgiving, huh?

00:04.505 --> 00:06.207
Watching
a second-grade president

00:06.240 --> 00:08.376
on a power trip
pardon a turkey?

00:08.409 --> 00:10.811
Sad thing is, this is
the highlight of my week.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.414
Give Rory a break.
He's running for re-election.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.515
I spent all night
helping him

00:14.548 --> 00:16.150
with his Barack Obama
impression.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.851
Uh, look,
uh, I want to be clear.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.353
That's pretty good.
Thanks.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.921
Hey.
Miggy's gonna be a minute.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.490
He's stuck in
the security line.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.657
This ain't right.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.926
We all got
a job to do.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.062
Hey, Room Parent,
I saw your coffee station.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.864
A little worried those beans
weren't farmed responsibly.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.833
Yeah, that's because
they weren't.
Move along, please.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.102
Hm.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.539
Pronstroller -- she just
broke up with her boyfriend,

00:38.572 --> 00:41.509
so now all of her extra energy
is directed on me.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.776
She texted me last night,

00:42.810 --> 00:45.846
asking if I was okay with
non-gendered CPR dummies.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.682
Hmm.
I have no opinion
in these matters.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.051
Tell you what I do know --
that woman needs a man.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.586
Uh --

00:52.620 --> 00:55.456
Will, why don't you
take her off my hands?

00:55.489 --> 00:56.624
I'm dating someone.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.858
Tracy Freeze?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.194
I told you I'm bringing her
to your Thanksgiving?

01:00.228 --> 01:01.462
Hey, Miggy.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.763
Did you know if you don't have
kids at this school,

01:02.796 --> 01:04.198
they put you on a list?

01:04.232 --> 01:05.633
Check this -- you and me,
we're gonna be

01:05.666 --> 01:07.535
the only single losers
at Thanksgiving.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.802
Oh, you're not
gonna love this,

01:08.836 --> 01:11.038
but, um, I've been seeing
someone for a few weeks.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.041
We're vibing pretty hard!
I'm gonna bring her.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.042
Really?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.144
So, it's just gonna be me

01:16.177 --> 01:17.745
and Tony
at the singles table.

01:17.778 --> 01:18.879
Well, actually,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.781
Cassandra and Tony
are back together again.

01:20.814 --> 01:21.982
She stopped gambling,

01:22.015 --> 01:23.717
and he's actually learning
how to listen.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.653
* 'Cause we're number one *

01:25.686 --> 01:28.256
* Number one, number one,
number one, number one *

01:28.289 --> 01:29.790
* Number one, number one *

01:29.823 --> 01:31.825
Good morning, Hilltop.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.395
Today, I would like to grant
a presidential pardon

01:34.428 --> 01:35.963
to a very special guest.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.799
Please welcome Cookies!

01:38.832 --> 01:40.000
"Hail to the Chief" plays

01:44.104 --> 01:45.439
Whoa!

01:45.473 --> 01:48.142
Code Blue!
Get him out!
Let's go!
Let's go!

01:49.210 --> 01:52.180
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:56.284 --> 01:57.651
Oh.

01:57.685 --> 01:58.786
Hello, Tony.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.454
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.923
I thought I was doing
the turkey,

02:02.956 --> 02:04.858
but I guess we have
two turkeys.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.126
What a blessing.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.863
Well, he's doing it again.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.532
Tony always has to one-up me
at the holidays.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.866
This is just like Labor Day.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.809
You know what?
Tony is an old man.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.044
The only thing
he's at war with is time.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.013
Well, looks like my hands
are gonna be full,

02:26.046 --> 02:28.349
so can you do me a favor
and hang out with Tracy
when she gets here?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.617
Oh, really, dude?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.952
The one good thing about
being single on Thanksgiving

02:31.985 --> 02:33.854
is being able to drink
without having responsibility

02:33.887 --> 02:35.189
for anybody but myself.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.957
Isn't Graham here?
Probably.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.327
Look, it'll be easy.
You and Tracy are friends.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.462
We've said, like, four words
to each other ever --

02:41.495 --> 02:43.864
"Hi," "Hello," "Hey,"
and "Nice shoes,"

02:43.897 --> 02:46.467
which is just girl-speak for
"Hello," so, doesn't count.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.302
Angie, this is Tracy and I's
first holiday together,

02:48.336 --> 02:49.403
and, more importantly,

02:49.437 --> 02:51.972
my first opportunity
to cook her a bird.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.841
So the stakes
could not be higher.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.310
I'm begging you, please
just put in a little effort.

02:56.344 --> 03:00.314
Today is about gathering
and sharing in the...

03:00.348 --> 03:01.715
Oh, no,
that's fine, Tony.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.951
Use as much of my sea salt
as you need.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.054
Son of a bitch.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.989
What are we doing?
The guests are arriving.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.491
And you know this is
a white Thanksgiving,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.159
so folks are gonna
want to eat at 2:00.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.395
I just want to
savor this moment

03:14.428 --> 03:16.430
before we're besieged
with riffraff --

03:16.464 --> 03:19.400
and yes, I am including
our kids in that mix.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.669
Oh. Well, I don't know.
It's such a big house.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.404
So many rooms
to give thanks in.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.339
Indeed.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.040
Including rooms
I've never seen before.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.177
Oh, that door's
locked.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.345
Can we unlock it?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.747
Let's not ruin
the sensual atmosphere

03:33.781 --> 03:35.082
with questions.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.083
Uh-huh.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.519
Time to play host.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.788
Okay.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.623
Sorry, but what's
behind the door?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.495
Oh, your ass
gonna get opened.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.364
This is the life.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.733
Why do we need to wait
for holidays to relax?

03:52.766 --> 03:55.102
Every Thursday
should be like this.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.571
Emma Fogerty's
off the clock.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.374
Feels good to
let the gut out.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.413
Fine, I'll get it.

04:05.446 --> 04:09.116
Got forbid I lay down
for five seconds.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.558
Ms. Homily Pronstroller!

04:17.591 --> 04:18.892
Graham.
Happy Genocide Day.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.928
My teacher.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.230
In my temporary home?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.065
Who's watching
the school?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.066
Hi, friends.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.568
Uh, what are we doing
with our day?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.470
I hope we're not
just lying around.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.172
Um...no.
No.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.742
We are in
our comfy pants...

04:34.775 --> 04:38.245
because we are rehearsing
our Thanksgiving play.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.915
Well, I'm sure it'll reflect
everything I've taught you

04:41.949 --> 04:43.951
and not traditional
holiday stereotypes.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.655
Graham: Great. Now we got to
come up with a play.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.022
We're screwed.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.258
Do any of you even remember
the Thanksgiving unit?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.660
No.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.929
If I thought I wasn't
gonna direct a play
today, I was crazy.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.631
To the sauna!

04:58.666 --> 05:00.668
Okay, so you're really just
gonna let it sit...

05:00.701 --> 05:02.436
You're dating
the teacher?
Yeah.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.605
Did you think I was
hanging out at your kids'
school for no reason?

05:04.638 --> 05:05.806
And none of you
said anything?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.107
Oh, this is fantastic.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.809
I was hoping
she'd start dating again

05:08.842 --> 05:11.812
so she'd have more in her life
than just ordering me around.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.447
Miggy, my simple friend,

05:13.481 --> 05:15.783
you are the answer
to my prayers.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.017
Our vibe is electric.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.219
Me plus her equals heart emoji
plus fireworks emoji

05:19.252 --> 05:21.455
plus a double dose
of train emojis.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.890
It's an inside joke.

05:22.923 --> 05:23.991
Mm.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.158
Douglas, did you get my text

05:25.192 --> 05:26.627
about the blow-up snowman
we got

05:26.660 --> 05:27.695
for the holiday pageant?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.029
Well, it didn't come
with a motor,

05:29.062 --> 05:30.631
so you're gonna have to
blow it up with your mouth.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.733
I did and will
certainly get to it.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.536
I just wouldn't want to take
time away from you and Miggy.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.243
You call that vibe
electric?

05:43.276 --> 05:44.478
Why didn't you
say anything?

05:44.512 --> 05:45.979
Oh, we've never talked.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.748
You're dating someone
you've never talked to?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.817
That's how people date
in the digital age.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.318
It's all about
sliding into DMs,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.186
GIFs, likes, reposts,
double taps.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.187
You feel me?

05:54.221 --> 05:58.258
I do not, nor will I ever.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.728
Nice shoes, Tracy.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.829
Oh, nice shoes to you.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.863
Hmm.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.335
Did I say
"nice shoes"?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.337
Yeah.
Did I say it back?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.705
Yeah.
Mm.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.908
You know,
it's been a while

06:14.942 --> 06:16.677
since I've done
a group Thanksgiving.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.345
Most years,
I just do Walter's Diner.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.346
Shut up.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.515
You know Walter's?
Yes! Of course.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.451
It's exclusively for
sad and single people.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.618
It's like
the middle seat on a plane,

06:24.652 --> 06:25.919
but a restaurant.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.688
Huh.
Tracy Freeze knows Walter's.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.590
Did not see that coming.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.758
Oh, yeah.
I'm a wild card.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.293
Check this -- I have
a bearded dragon named BJ.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.028
What?
No way.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.964
Yeah. No cage.
Just loose in my house.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.232
Okay, Freeze.
I'm not changing the channel.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.534
What else you got?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.304
Miggy?
A moment?

06:46.474 --> 06:47.708
Yo.
Listen.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.543
I just got another e-mail
from Pronstroller.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.145
Subject heading -- "Clear
your next five Saturdays."

06:52.179 --> 06:54.448
I thought you were gonna
get her off my back.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.984
Dude, I told you, people my age
don't have conversations.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.086
Well, maybe it's time
you learned how to have one.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.454
In fact...Pronstroller?

07:01.354 --> 07:03.657
Both of you, in my study,
10 minutes.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.992
And you may want
to brace yourself,

07:05.025 --> 07:06.494
because I have
multiple paintings

07:06.527 --> 07:08.562
by George W. Bush
in there.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.397
Oh.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.465
You're kidding.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.600
I am not kidding!

07:12.633 --> 07:13.734
Oh.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.003
This printer is stylish
and fire-resistant.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.471
Oh.
Snerfink.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.772
Mm.
Make a note of it
in your phone.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.407
S-N-E-R-F...
Mm-hmm.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.075
...I-N-K.
I-N-K.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.310
Mm-hmm.
I am sold.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.512
I am buying one.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.514
Can't!
It was recalled years ago.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.515
No.
Okay, your turn.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.750
Okay.
Um...let's see.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.985
I told you about...

07:32.019 --> 07:34.421
the Chipotle
I co-own in Memphis,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.690
my meltdown at
the Laugh Factory...
Ah.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.860
...how I was in the test trial
of NuvaRing.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.929
I feel like that's it.

07:41.962 --> 07:42.930
Dig deep, Freeze.

07:42.963 --> 07:43.931
I'm gonna go gas up,

07:43.964 --> 07:45.866
and when I come back,
I want juicy.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.601
Juice.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.736
Juice.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.772
I think Tony put something
in my gravy.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.542
How's it going with Tracy?
Seems like you guys are bonding.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.709
We are.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.278
Will, did you know
that Tracy is actually cool?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.047
Like, you are dating
a cool person.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.282
She's got a frickin'
loose lizard in her house.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.452
Well, Angie, and I mean this
in the nicest way possible --

08:05.485 --> 08:06.386
in your face.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.956
So, you want me
to tell you

08:08.989 --> 08:10.824
everything I know
about Thanksgiving.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.627
Yeah, and hurry. Or do you not
want me to go to college?

08:13.661 --> 08:14.628
Okay.

08:14.662 --> 08:17.330
Um...Plymouth Rock.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.133
Corn is maize.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.570
Um...Santa Maria?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.471
That was Columbus.
Are you kidding me?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.306
This was a waste
of my time.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.975
Alright.
You were right.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.042
I was wrong.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.311
She's perfect.
Are you happy?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.914
I will be happy when I am
standing on Tony's grave.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.684
Tony, don't touch
that stuff!

08:36.717 --> 08:38.852
I'll preheat your ass to 350!

08:40.353 --> 08:43.090
Oh, Angie, do you know
anything about...

08:43.123 --> 08:44.291
Of course you don't.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.997
Hey, uh,
I thought of something juicy

08:50.030 --> 08:51.231
to tell you about me.
Ooh.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.566
Juice me, Freeze.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.768
But remember, you can't tell
anyone, especially Will.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.503
Mama loves a secret.
Come on.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.172
I, um...

08:59.206 --> 09:01.174
I don't like Sophie.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.010
Hey-o!

09:03.043 --> 09:04.878
But for real, what is it?

09:04.912 --> 09:07.681
No, for real.
That kid is so annoying.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.683
Ooh!
Yeah.
Right?

09:09.717 --> 09:12.052
Mm!
Oh, God.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.887
This is fun.
Mm-hmm.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.222
What fun.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.625
We're still having fun.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.027
Mm.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.702
Alrighty. First things first --
give me your phones.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.203
What?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.305
I'll give them back to you
when we're done. Come on.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.877
Miggy,
what are you doing?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.478
Oh. Sometimes,
when I don't have my phone,

09:38.511 --> 09:39.880
my thumb continues texting.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.748
Stop it!

09:40.781 --> 09:41.882
Alright, I've come up

09:41.915 --> 09:44.918
with a few everyday
conversation starters.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.656
"Baseball
Hall of Famers."

09:48.689 --> 09:50.323
"Poetry -- Why?"

09:50.357 --> 09:52.926
"Conical-shaped
brassieres."

09:52.960 --> 09:55.562
"How to look like a gentleman
in the hot summer months."

09:55.595 --> 09:56.897
Now, that is a rich vein,

09:56.930 --> 10:00.067
and you may find yourself musing
on the subject of shorts.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.735
Are they ever appropriate?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.270
You'll get there
on your own.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.451
Oh, hey, Poppy.
There you are.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.020
I've got to talk to you.
Wait, what are you doing?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.154
Douglas won't tell me
what's behind this door,

10:21.188 --> 10:22.455
so
I'm breaking in.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.857
Yeah. My thing's
more interesting.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.592
Look.
Get this, alright?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.360
Will's girlfriend,
Tracy Freeze,

10:27.394 --> 10:30.698
said she doesn't like Sophie.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.799
Bombshell.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.801
Wait.
How is that a bombshell?
Because.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.704
Wouldn't you be upset
if Douglas said
Rory was annoying?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.672
Oh, I'm pretty sure Douglas
does find Rory annoying,

10:38.706 --> 10:40.307
because -- news flash --
kids are annoying.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.376
Ooh, that should be
a slogan for condoms.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.678
Anyway, Ang, please tell me

10:44.712 --> 10:45.979
you didn't make
a big deal out of this.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.447
Relax, alright?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.850
On the inside,
I was super judgmental,

10:49.883 --> 10:52.185
but on the outside,
I said all the right things.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.787
Oh, God.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.389
I can't believe I said I didn't
like my boyfriend's daughter.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.458
That is a big problem.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.193
And also, I meant it.
Ohhh.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.361
Are Will and I doomed?

11:01.394 --> 11:04.798
I meeeeeean...

11:04.832 --> 11:07.000
Oh, no.
You "I meaned" her?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.635
"I mean"
is a neutral statement.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.337
Yeah, but what about
the high-pitched part?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.638
That part I can't explain.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.474
Look, don't you think that
Will should know about this?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.643
Okay, look, Ang, I'm on
my own deadline here, okay,

11:16.676 --> 11:17.845
so let's
speed things along.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.146
Permission to switch
into bitch mode.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.213
Permission granted.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.481
Bitch, what is this
really about?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.550
Are you hating on
other people's relationships

11:23.583 --> 11:25.218
just because you're the only
single person here?

11:25.252 --> 11:28.155
Bitch, do not
single-shame me, alright?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.422
I may not be
in a relationship,

11:29.456 --> 11:30.490
but at least I'm not
trying to break into

11:30.523 --> 11:31.859
my boyfriend's
locked door.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.927
Bitch,
that man had a secret son.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.829
For all I know, there's a twin
brother behind that door,

11:35.863 --> 11:37.064
or -- or a dead wife

11:37.097 --> 11:38.331
or illegally imported
skin products

11:38.365 --> 11:40.567
I could use just in case
black does crack.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.036
Now, look, Ang,
Will and Tracy's relationship

11:43.070 --> 11:44.504
is not your business.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.273
So just support him.
He'd do the same for you.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.009
You're right, okay?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.377
I will let it go.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.678
But for the record,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.246
I'm not the only
single person here.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.715
None of the kids
have dates.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.751
Yes, bitch.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.622
Hey, have you seen Poppy?
Will: No.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.292
Have you seen Tracy
or Angie or Miggy

12:05.325 --> 12:06.526
or any of our children?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.861
Where is everyone?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.096
What the hell happened
to your hand?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.198
The short version is,
I punched Tony's turkey.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.866
Will you cut
the guy a break?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.634
He's a good egg,
and he's had a hard life.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.436
He's seen things --

12:16.469 --> 12:18.671
usually through the sight
of a high-powered rifle.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.642
What was that?

12:22.675 --> 12:24.377
That's the sound of
two 24-year-olds

12:24.411 --> 12:26.479
attempting to have
a conversation.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.950
They must have gotten to the
card that says "Desert Storm."

12:29.983 --> 12:31.551
Right.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.820
Wait, what?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.222
We had to invade.
Saddam had us by the balls --

12:35.255 --> 12:36.256
Oh, God!

12:36.289 --> 12:38.391
Hey, Douglas.
Great flashcards.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.592
Hope you don't
want them back.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.897
It's been two hours,
and we're nowhere.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.332
What do we do?

12:45.365 --> 12:46.800
You know what? I say we stage
a medical emergency.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.335
Sophie,
let me see you faint.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.669
You do it.
Fine.

12:49.702 --> 12:50.838
Take notes, babies.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.807
It's '97,

12:53.841 --> 12:57.077
and we've just lost
our princess.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.248
Hey, guys.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.583
Who said that?
Are you an angel?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.318
Yeah.
Have you seen Tracy?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.319
No.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.354
Hey, Angie,
what the heck?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.156
I just got a text.
Tracy said she left?

13:09.189 --> 13:10.657
Oh, my God.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.459
Okay. Come with me.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.295
And scene.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.333
Mm. Ah.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.434
Mm.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.703
Hey, D, you want to
get in on this?

13:23.736 --> 13:25.672
Do I want to drink from
the faucet with you?

13:25.705 --> 13:27.707
I do not.
Okay.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.677
Uh, guess you didn't need
those flashcards.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.880
No, we did. We got to one
that said "boat names,"

13:32.913 --> 13:33.981
and I was like,
"I don't know any,"

13:34.014 --> 13:35.615
and she was like,
"Let's have sex."

13:35.648 --> 13:37.684
And you obliged,
in my home.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.888
Well, at least things with
you two are moving along.

13:40.921 --> 13:41.889
Nah, we're through.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.825
We DM'd, we liked each
other's posts, we had sex.

13:45.859 --> 13:46.860
That's the arc.
No, no, no.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.528
The arc is
you keep seeing her

13:48.561 --> 13:51.064
so I can get back to a world
with no nut allergies

13:51.098 --> 13:53.400
and where everyone knows
what gender they are.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.235
Yeah, but I don't know if
I really like Pronstroller.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.469
I barely know her.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.805
Well, then why end it
before you find out?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.208
Come on. Don't pretend
like you care.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.475
I do.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.645
I started to like the idea
of you having someone.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.981
I was tired of watching you
walk around alone

14:08.015 --> 14:10.683
with your weird hat
and weird baby.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.052
He is weird, right?

14:13.120 --> 14:16.323
Listen, you can always go back
to your BMs,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.491
but you have to
ask yourself --

14:18.525 --> 14:21.828
"Maybe I'm ready for
something more real."

14:21.861 --> 14:23.931
You mean like
what you have with Poppy?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.498
Do not discuss
my private life.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.201
But yes.

14:28.235 --> 14:32.839
Hey, guys,
the play is almost...

14:32.872 --> 14:34.507
Oh, no.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.276
Oh, God.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.112
No one's buying it,
Rory.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.480
God, this kid's
annoying.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.686
Will: Walter's?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.122
Isn't this place for
people without families,
loved ones, or hope?

14:49.156 --> 14:51.858
No depression, no despair,
no service.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.793
Oh, no.
Tracy is here.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.528
Ugh,
this is all my fault.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.197
I got so caught up
in my feud with Tony,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.966
I didn't spend any time
with my girlfriend.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.700
What if that was
Tony's plan all along?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.370
Will, no.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.704
This is actually on me.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.407
We started talking
about your relationship,

15:07.440 --> 15:09.076
and I may have
spooked her.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.577
What? How?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.145
It was accidental.

15:12.179 --> 15:15.315
Oh. I specifically asked you
to be supportive this time.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.483
A-And I was, and it was
going really well.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.118
I even shared
some of Douglas' wine --

15:18.151 --> 15:20.954
the good stuff that I hoard
for myself in the sauna.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.056
But then she said something
that I didn't love,

15:23.090 --> 15:24.291
and I tried to be cool --

15:24.324 --> 15:25.825
Oh, God.
You "I meaned" her.

15:25.858 --> 15:26.893
No. I never said that.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.061
You "I mean" me
all the time.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.396
Why do you think
I have a beard again?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.563
Is that why
that thing is back?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.332
You do think I look
better with it, right?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.734
I meeeeeeean...

15:34.767 --> 15:36.403
Well, now, I am very confused.
Okay, look.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.007
Tracy is great, okay?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.941
And maybe
I was feeling down

15:41.975 --> 15:44.844
about being the only
single person at Thanksgiving,

15:44.877 --> 15:46.913
and I took it out on her.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.915
But you're in a good
relationship --

15:48.948 --> 15:49.916
over the holidays.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.118
That never happens.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.523
So, go.
Get your girl.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.094
Thanks.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.796
Wait. What did Tracy say
that upset you?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.765
She just said that...

16:05.798 --> 16:08.101
she was very excited
to try Tony's turkey.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.369
Oh, yeah?

16:09.402 --> 16:10.637
Well, is she also excited
for him to go straight to Hell?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.139
Don't do this. Just go.
Okay.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.290
That's what
I'm talking about, Walter.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.359
Keep that diner single.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.796
Are you okay?
I haven't seen you all day.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.898
Look.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.567
The truth is,
I got in my head

16:40.600 --> 16:41.968
that you're hiding
something in here.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.736
And this is your next
logical step?

16:43.770 --> 16:46.573
Hey, in my defense,
you've had your share
of skeletons, Douglas.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.175
Okay, you're right.
I haven't been an open book.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.211
But I promise you, I'm not
hiding any more adult sons.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.979
Why'd you specify
adult sons?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.481
You know what?
I'm sorry.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.050
I'm just --
I'm paranoid because...

16:57.084 --> 16:59.486
I haven't been in something
this good in a while,

16:59.519 --> 17:01.321
and you're making me
a little crazy.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.190
You think you're crazy?

17:03.223 --> 17:06.193
I just lectured Miggy
on the benefits of romance,

17:06.226 --> 17:08.528
and that was only 50%
out of self-interest.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.530
That's what you're doing
to my brain.

17:10.563 --> 17:14.167
You actually make me thankful
on Thanksgiving.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.604
For me?
Mm-hmm.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.707
Well, I'm thankful
for you, too.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.047
And I meant
everything I said.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.682
But I really got to know
what's behind this door.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.584
So, can you...

17:31.618 --> 17:32.852
You are unbelievable.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.487
Well, I-I just
want to see it.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.959
Well, that's a real
let-down.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.361
Yeah.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.802
Hey, so, uh,
I made a couple of cards.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.870
They're not as good
as Douglas',

17:50.903 --> 17:54.107
but...I-I want to
get to know you.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.211
Okay.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.247
"Food."

18:00.280 --> 18:02.415
"Table."

18:02.449 --> 18:03.583
"Chairs."

18:03.616 --> 18:05.552
W-Were these just things
you were looking at?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.387
Yeah, yeah. You know what?
You're right. These are stupid.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.755
No, no.
I want to talk.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.391
Let's do, um...food.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.825
Okay.
Okay.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.995
Um...I...

18:16.028 --> 18:17.664
I like ranch dressing.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.898
I love ranch!

18:18.931 --> 18:20.667
It's my second-favorite food,
after ketchup.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.070
So, is everything cool
with Tracy?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.238
Yeah.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.174
I, uh, I think I'll wait
till after the holidays

18:27.207 --> 18:28.441
to bring up
the Tony thing --

18:28.475 --> 18:30.577
if they aren't sleeping
with each other by then.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.679
Or you could drop it
and never bring it up.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.481
Oh, Angie.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.915
Permission to go
full bitch mode?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.450
Denied.
Damn it.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.918
I'm gonna go check
on my turkey.

18:42.455 --> 18:46.159
So...glad you and Will
worked things out.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.260
We did.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.861
And thank you for
bringing him to Walter's

18:48.895 --> 18:51.030
and not spilling any of that
crazy stuff I said.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.098
Oh.
Of course.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.100
I mean, you know,
the truth is, it's...

18:54.133 --> 18:55.335
it's not that crazy.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.937
I didn't really get kids
until I had one of my own.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.273
And even now,
I'm only half on board.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.841
Kidding.
Wonderful child.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.109
I get it, Angie.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.011
You and Will
are both parents.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.779
You'll always
have that bond.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.848
I'm not part
of your club.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.650
Oh. Well, no,
that's not what I meant.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.185
It's all good.

19:12.219 --> 19:15.121
And it was fun almost making
friends with you tonight.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.223
Almost?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.291
But I thought we had
a good time.
We did.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.560
But I don't think
we're gonna do that again.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.231
Thank you
for keeping my secret,

19:24.264 --> 19:26.899
and I promise
I will keep yours.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.635
Wait, what secret?

19:30.036 --> 19:31.604
I think you know.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.675
You're in my seat.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.380
Oh.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.157
Oh.
You must be Cassandra.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.060
Graham:
Mom, over here.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.832
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present Tony's turkey.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.501
Wow.
As big as a condor

20:01.534 --> 20:03.169
and twice as delicious.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.171
But also,
probably more important,

20:05.204 --> 20:07.840
is save some room for my turkey,
which will be out shortly.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.176
It's just someone
turned off the oven.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.345
But you don't know anything
about that, do you, Tony?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.346
There. There.
He just smiled.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.847
Did you see that?
Did you see?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.616
He's 110 pounds
of pure evil.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.418
Okay, well,
just eat the damn turkey.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.852
Fine.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.122
I will eat this slop,
but I will not be happy about --

20:23.155 --> 20:24.524
Oh.
Oh, my God.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.394
It's the best thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.895
It's my own fault.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.063
All those times I punched it
made it more tender.

20:31.097 --> 20:35.368
Okay.
Tony, you've done it again.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.869
Tony.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.237
Tony.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.039
Tony?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.574
Ah, let him sleep.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.877
He has a 5k tomorrow.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.145
To Thanksgiving.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.948
All: Happy Thanksgiving.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.119
This is the story
about Thanksgiving --

20:53.152 --> 20:55.121
a story that reflects
all of the knowledge

20:55.154 --> 20:56.222
bestowed upon us

20:56.255 --> 20:58.491
by our guest of honor,
Ms. Pronstroller.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.497
Pilgrims.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.898
Native Americans.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.334
A new world.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.068
Turkeys.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.504
-Cranberries.
-A boat.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.573
-Two boats.
-Three boats.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.842
Possibly four boats.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.279
Is this all
they've learned this year?

21:20.313 --> 21:22.349
Please e-mail all concerns
to Douglas.
