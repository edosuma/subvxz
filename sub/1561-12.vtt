WEBVTT

00:02.628 --> 00:04.721
(indistinct chatter,
dog barking in distance)

00:04.922 --> 00:06.344
(glass shatters)

00:06.548 --> 00:08.050
MAN: Hey, baby, want a ride?

00:11.386 --> 00:13.059
Hey, girl. Where you going?

00:13.263 --> 00:15.357
WOMAN (in distance):
I told you, hurry up!

00:16.767 --> 00:18.815
(man speaks indistinctly)

00:22.898 --> 00:24.696
Taylor.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.777
What brings you back?

00:26.985 --> 00:30.159
My brother's funeral's tomorrow.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.580
I got just what you need.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.913
A little bit of down,
and a whole lot of up.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.043
##

00:44.753 --> 00:46.551
Why don't you come inside?

00:51.635 --> 00:54.434
Maybe next time.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.817
(low snarling)

00:59.017 --> 01:01.236
(panting, trembling)

01:13.323 --> 01:14.916
(whooshing)

01:15.075 --> 01:17.123
(electrical buzzing)

01:17.327 --> 01:18.829
(trembling breath)

01:20.163 --> 01:22.461
(electrical crackling)

01:24.167 --> 01:26.261
(gasping)

01:30.382 --> 01:31.508
(yells)

01:31.717 --> 01:34.311
(Taylor screaming, gasping)

01:34.511 --> 01:36.309
(deep roaring)

01:38.932 --> 01:41.185
No!

01:42.519 --> 01:45.113
(crackling)

01:45.314 --> 01:48.033
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:51.945 --> 01:54.824
(indistinct chatter nearby)

01:57.034 --> 02:00.709
OFFICER 1:
What kind of drug does that?

02:00.912 --> 02:02.539
OFFICER 2:
Not one you give yourself.

02:02.748 --> 02:03.840
OFFICER 1: Mm.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.839
Looks like she was
beaten to death.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.592
(low crackling)

02:08.794 --> 02:09.887
(gasps)

02:10.088 --> 02:12.011
Ambulance! Now! Ambulance!

02:34.863 --> 02:36.661
CONSTANTINE:
You haven't moved since I left.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.666
Did you get cilantro?

02:38.867 --> 02:42.713
I got tannis root, adder's
tongue and catnip, so no.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.790
Scry map's still dry.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.046
You getting anything off that radio?
I'm scanning

02:47.250 --> 02:49.048
for weird, but coming up empty.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.720
What's this?

02:50.921 --> 02:52.423
Leave it, John.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.184
She wants to be alone.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.058
Does she, now?

03:13.485 --> 03:15.408
(door creaks)

03:17.030 --> 03:19.158
(wind chimes tinkling)

03:22.536 --> 03:24.413
Ariadne's thread.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.217
Well, at least you
took precautions.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.512
She used it to save Theseus
from the labyrinth.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.055
And then he abandoned her.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.008
Heroes are usually
jerks at heart.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.639
- He left her on the island?
- Yeah, but she made out all right

03:38.844 --> 03:40.141
in the end, didn't she?

03:40.345 --> 03:43.269
Bagged herself a god. Dionysus.

03:43.473 --> 03:47.603
All that adventure started
from one thin bit of thread.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.609
(smacks lips)

03:49.813 --> 03:52.612
(flaughs) How many of these
rooms have you seen?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.238
Just this one.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.990
It never changes.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.243
(sighs)
It's like a good song on repeat.

03:59.448 --> 04:02.452
Come here to escape
your visions?

04:02.659 --> 04:06.414
You might've gone too far
too fast back in New York.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.419
Hell of a hangover
comes with magic,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.050
even if you're born to it.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.378
But the best cure
for that hangover

04:12.586 --> 04:13.929
is another drink.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.598
So buck up, soldier,
come out of your tent,

04:16.798 --> 04:19.221
because there's a war on,
in case you forgot.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.019
I don't think I'm ready.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.723
Nobody's ever ready,
not for what we do.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.770
But this is the labyrinth
we chose to walk.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.946
Innit?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.533
(door closes, Constantine sighs)

04:42.741 --> 04:45.665
Hopefully, I've got our psychic
out of sensory deprivation.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.212
She needs her rest.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.039
Oh, sure, yeah, well,

04:49.247 --> 04:51.420
why don't we all just take
a bloody holiday, eh?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.127
MANNY:
'Don't even think about it.'

04:53.335 --> 04:55.633
(groans)

04:55.837 --> 04:59.387
Oh, I forgot... angels,
they can't read sarcasm.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.060
I can read it; ljust
don't have patience for it.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.354
The Brujeria is
amassing power, John.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.023
Oh, have you come with
some news for me, then?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.271
Because you're the all-knowing,

05:08.475 --> 05:09.943
all-seeing agent
of the Almighty,

05:10.143 --> 05:12.271
and yet it seems to me
that I'm the one

05:12.479 --> 05:14.732
that's always giving you the information.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.283
St. Catherine's Hospital.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.905
A woman named Taylor
will be brought in

05:18.109 --> 05:19.656
with what looks
like an overdose.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.784
Are you actually
giving me a case?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.366
Or maybe, just maybe,
this is another form

05:24.574 --> 05:27.418
of manipulation dressed up
as angelic guidance.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.587
Why don't I verify that

05:29.788 --> 05:31.290
with the scry map.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.886
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:36.086 --> 05:38.965
(groaning)

05:39.172 --> 05:40.890
Of course!

05:41.091 --> 05:45.187
Angels aren't against
pandering bloody theatrics!

05:45.345 --> 05:47.768
How the bloody hell
is that going to help us, eh?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.520
The scry map is a crutch.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.352
What's going on out there
is pervasive.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.655
Invunche, Brujeria, the Serpent himself?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.402
We're off the map now, John.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.074
You need to read
the signs around you.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.824
Use your instincts,
Zed's visions.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.495
Stay vigilant.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.198
(whooshing)

06:06.116 --> 06:07.868
How the hell
did I get over here?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.999
Manny.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.080
I hate being used.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.337
Do us a favor, mate.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.714
Reel Zed in, will you?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.170
It's time she got back
in the field.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.595
Oh, and, um,

06:19.796 --> 06:21.639
grab your biggest screwdriver.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.102
For what?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.148
CONSTANTINE: Nurse!

06:30.348 --> 06:31.895
Nurse, we need some help here.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.560
My mate's gone and fallen
on his bloody screwdriver.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.353
Got himself all screwed up.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.153
Yes, some mate.

06:35.353 --> 06:35.774
Sir, please have a seat.

06:35.979 --> 06:36.445
This hurts like a bitch.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.772
You should've just killed me.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.028
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
stop your whining.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.279
This is your best plan?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.530
Best is the enemy of good, luv.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.578
This, this is a good plan.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.581
NURSE: Here we go.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.159
All right,
let's get you up here.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.995
(groaning) Thank you.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.750
Okay.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.674
(Chas groaning)

06:58.460 --> 06:59.461
(groaning continues)

06:59.669 --> 07:00.886
Black veins.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.261
That's her.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.559
We need to get closer.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.181
(Chas chuckles)

07:07.385 --> 07:08.762
Of course you do.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.722
(sighs)

07:12.265 --> 07:13.812
(screaming)

07:14.017 --> 07:15.815
She's stable.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.692
Go ahead.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.196
(indistinct conversations)

07:27.739 --> 07:29.286
NURSE 2:
'All right, take her into two.'

07:29.491 --> 07:31.334
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

07:38.166 --> 07:39.918
(both gasp)

07:46.675 --> 07:47.346
(gasps)

07:47.550 --> 07:48.176
Oh, oh, hey.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.853
That looked like a barrel
of bloody laughs.

07:50.053 --> 07:50.929
Are you all right?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.480
I was just...

07:52.681 --> 07:54.934
There was, there was a light.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.064
It was white hot,
and it-it came from above.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.611
It-it hurt really bad.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.655
It was like it was trying
to kill me.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.356
(beeping rapidly)

08:01.564 --> 08:02.110
DOCTOR: Code blue!

08:02.315 --> 08:03.362
Here, stand back, stand back.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.488
Move out of the way.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.910
Look at me.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.909
She's coding!
We need a crash cart!

08:08.113 --> 08:10.332
Focus on me.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.709
All right,
her pressure's dropping.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.661
There's no way
that's an overdose.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.916
Look at the veins.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.590
No man-made drug could do that.

08:18.790 --> 08:19.666
No, no, no, no.

08:19.874 --> 08:20.875
Come on, come on.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.085
DOCTOR: Give her an epi.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.215
NURSE: One milligram of epi.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.342
Come on, come on, come on.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.139
Where's respiratory?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.261
(indistinct announcements
over P.A.)

08:27.465 --> 08:28.261
(gasps)

08:28.466 --> 08:29.683
Zed, what's wrong?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.602
Hey, we need some help here.
Whoa, whoa.

08:31.803 --> 08:32.804
We need some help!
She's having a seizure!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.014
Zed. Zed.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.940
We need some help over here now!

08:36.140 --> 08:37.393
(gasping)

08:48.445 --> 08:51.915
(mechanical whirring)

09:02.375 --> 09:04.377
TECHNICIAN (over speaker): 'Please
keep your head still, ma'am.'

09:10.967 --> 09:13.937
(loud, rhythmic thumping)

09:15.930 --> 09:17.227
CHAS (muffled): 'How is she?'

09:17.432 --> 09:19.230
'Zed, how is she?'

09:19.434 --> 09:20.560
'John?'

09:20.769 --> 09:21.691
(clearly): 'John!'

09:21.895 --> 09:23.317
Yeah?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.773
Oh, she's fine,
she's fine, yeah.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.654
That, uh, vision just

09:26.858 --> 09:28.701
threw her for a loop is all.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.950
E.R. doc's looking
for a medical malady,

09:31.154 --> 09:32.827
not a psychic gift,
so he's not gonna find anything.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.033
On the other hand, Manny,

09:35.241 --> 09:37.619
he's pointed us straight
at that Taylor bird.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.999
Black veins, huh?

09:39.204 --> 09:40.456
I've never seen that before.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.882
I need a closer look
at the body.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.756
Yeah, she's probably

09:44.959 --> 09:46.176
in the morgue by now.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.424
(grunts)

09:47.629 --> 09:49.256
Yeah, that's a good idea.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.808
Stay here, they're likely
to experiment on you

09:52.008 --> 09:53.681
in the name of science.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.228
Oh, like you did?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.227
That was in the name of magic.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.478
Put your pants on.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.227
MAN: 'Linda!'

10:02.435 --> 10:04.233
LINDA: 'Mr. Morris.'

10:04.437 --> 10:06.940
'You're not due for another
skin graft for two more weeks.'

10:07.148 --> 10:08.365
So why are you here?

10:08.566 --> 10:09.909
Bar fight.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.282
Might've knocked the
skin off my face,

10:11.486 --> 10:13.079
but you should see
the other guy.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.656
Wait, I don't want

10:14.864 --> 10:16.457
to waste my time talking
to some nurse.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.705
Where's Doc Galen?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.035
LINDA: Come on.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.496
These procedures are delicate.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.330
You shouldn't even be drinking,

10:22.539 --> 10:23.711
let alone getting
into a bar fight.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.087
Just go get the doc.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.385
'I don't have time for
one of your lectures.'

10:27.585 --> 10:28.586
(clears throat)

10:30.672 --> 10:31.924
CONSTANTINE: Smooth, mate.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.759
Real smooth.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.016
Let's go.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.356
(footsteps approaching)

10:43.560 --> 10:45.483
(clears throat)

10:45.645 --> 10:46.771
Who are you?

10:46.980 --> 10:47.902
I'm Detective Constantine.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.528
This is Officer Chandler.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.904
We need to take a look
at the homicide victim.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.156
'I don't work down here.'

10:52.318 --> 10:53.911
Go ahead.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.410
Good a place as any,
I suppose, to get tanked up.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.461
Let's get this spell done
before someone comes in, eh?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.255
Close your eyes.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.469
De Cruinne-ce

11:10.670 --> 11:12.547
agus Akasha

11:12.755 --> 11:16.726
seal! me do solas...

11:22.182 --> 11:24.526
- Wow.
- I told you to close your eyes.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.319
You could've burned
your bloody corneas.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.395
It's like she was...

11:27.604 --> 11:28.856
pure darkness.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.820
A human body, even a dead one,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.241
should show a vital spark.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.694
Elan vital.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.245
But Taylor, here,

11:35.445 --> 11:36.742
she's giving the
reverse impression.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.198
What did this to her? A demon?

11:38.406 --> 11:39.874
It's not an entity.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.371
It's dark matter.
I'd almost rather

11:41.576 --> 11:42.953
a garden-variety demon.
Look, do us a favor.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.629
Go back to the Mill House.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.502
Have a look through
Jasper's archives.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.958
He did a lot of research
on the matter.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.713
You'll check on Zed, right?

11:49.918 --> 11:51.841
Oh, I need to suss out what kind
of dark matter this is,

11:52.045 --> 11:53.422
whether it came in
on the back of this bird

11:53.630 --> 11:55.177
and where it's lurking now.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.428
John!

11:56.633 --> 11:59.853
Go see Zed first!

12:08.937 --> 12:10.564
WOMAN (over P.A. system):
'Dr. Bertoli to CICU.'

12:10.730 --> 12:13.984
'Repeat, Dr. Bertoli to CICU.'

12:15.985 --> 12:17.828
Gonna make a run for it?

12:18.029 --> 12:20.327
How'd you know?

12:20.531 --> 12:21.703
You're Zed Martin, right?

12:21.908 --> 12:22.875
Yeah. Doctor...?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.168
Galen.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.419
I'm the E.R. workhorse.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.622
I've got the results
of your scans here.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.877
CONSTANTINE: Oh, um,

12:29.082 --> 12:30.709
I'm sorry, Doc.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.089
I'll-I'll come back later.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.340
No.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.636
I want you to stay.

12:36.631 --> 12:37.598
Are you two...?

12:37.799 --> 12:38.470
Colleagues.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.346
Friends.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.676
(sighs)

12:40.885 --> 12:44.389
I spoke with
the radiologist on call

12:44.597 --> 12:46.520
and what your scans show
is there's a small mass

12:46.724 --> 12:47.600
on your temporal lobe.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.231
A tumor.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.652
GALEN: 'Well, we can't
be sure of that yet.'

12:50.853 --> 12:51.945
We won't know what
we're dealing with

12:52.146 --> 12:53.693
until we can do a biopsy.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.366
Is this your first seizure?

12:55.566 --> 12:56.909
Look here.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.578
Yeah.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.826
I almost passed out
a couple of weeks ago.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.452
Do you have headaches?

13:02.657 --> 13:03.829
Migraines.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.535
They're getting more intense.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.462
And I also have visions.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.131
GALEN:
'Well, that's not surprising,

13:10.331 --> 13:11.583
given the location of the mass.'

13:11.791 --> 13:13.338
Pressure on
the ventral temporal lobe

13:13.543 --> 13:15.511
can cause visual hallucinations.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.510
CONSTANTINE: It ain't a tumor
that's causing her visions, mate.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.137
She-she's been having them
a long time, trust me.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.184
Well, she might have had
this mass for a long time,

13:22.385 --> 13:23.682
if it's a slow grower.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.269
Look, Ms. Martin...
it may be nothing.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.941
But we'll find out for certain

13:29.142 --> 13:30.735
- and then go from there, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.562
(sniffles)

13:32.770 --> 13:34.693
GALEN:
Uh, I'll let you two talk.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.615
You just have the nurse
page me when you're ready.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.667
A tumor's causing my visions.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.328
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.129
Cold, hard science.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.582
Humans always look for

13:51.789 --> 13:54.633
narrative and causality.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.212
Nothing that he just said
suggests that this “mass“

13:57.420 --> 13:58.637
and your visions are linked

13:58.838 --> 13:59.964
in any way.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.265
You don't want to believe it.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.267
The thing about Ariadne...

14:07.472 --> 14:08.849
Dionysus rescued her,

14:09.057 --> 14:11.651
but she ended up dying anyway.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.774
Didn't she, John?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.611
WOMAN (over P.A. system): Nurse
Garcia, call the satellite pharmacy.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.537
Nurse Garcia, call
the satellite pharmacy.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.742
About time, numb nuts.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.701
Get this thing fixed.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.163
(buzzing, crackling)

14:31.371 --> 14:32.588
Okay.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.274
(lights buzzing, crackling)

14:59.482 --> 15:00.699
(sighs)

15:05.488 --> 15:07.582
(growling)

15:09.951 --> 15:12.625
(snarling)

15:12.829 --> 15:15.207
(snarling)

15:15.415 --> 15:16.837
(screams)

15:17.041 --> 15:19.089
(choking)

15:28.845 --> 15:29.846
(door closes)

15:30.054 --> 15:31.180
MAN: Excuse me, sir?

15:31.389 --> 15:33.812
Sir.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.393
CONSTANTINE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.648
I know, I can't smoke here.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.070
Actually, I was just, uh,

15:38.271 --> 15:39.443
hoping to get one of those.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.024
Ah, sure.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.529
Thanks.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.619
Filthy habit.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.118
Fix it!

15:48.322 --> 15:49.790
If this is about Zed...

15:49.991 --> 15:51.083
Who the hell do you
think it's about?!

15:51.284 --> 15:52.911
Did you know, eh? Did you know

15:53.119 --> 15:53.620
all this time?

15:53.828 --> 15:54.329
Calm down, John.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.914
She had headaches,
and I told her

15:56.122 --> 15:57.715
to push past the pain

15:57.915 --> 16:00.009
and get out there in the field
and fight bloody demons.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.176
I said that to her, Manny.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.378
This is not your fault.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.804
You're damn right
it's not my fault!

16:04.005 --> 16:04.972
Now fix it, or I'm not

16:05.173 --> 16:06.675
working for you anymore.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.180
- And how would you suggest that I...
- Heal her.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.057
I'm sorry, John.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.513
This is out of my hands.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.519
And yours. Now, look.
You can set yourself

16:13.723 --> 16:15.316
on fire with anger

16:15.516 --> 16:17.393
or you can focus
on what you can control.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.158
I think I'll do just that, mate.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.077
(coughs)

16:35.786 --> 16:38.915
Gaha oiad naneel

16:39.123 --> 16:40.670
ol Och...

16:44.170 --> 16:46.138
coraxo Oiad vnph.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.517
(gasps)

16:54.722 --> 16:56.099
What...

16:56.307 --> 16:57.559
what was that?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.019
A vial of air from Hades.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.319
A real stunner, eh?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.522
So was the siren I won it from.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.817
Now that... that was
a weekend to remember.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.118
What did you do, John?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.820
Took your advice.
I'm focusing on

17:10.029 --> 17:11.451
what I can control,
and that's you.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.078
Zed's laid out, so I need help.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.001
So now your boots are
on the ground with me.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.374
Trapped,
until the spell wears off.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.921
John...

17:19.121 --> 17:20.464
John, come here.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.588
(grunts)

17:22.791 --> 17:24.169
John, listen to me.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.221
It doesn't work like that, John.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.798
Listen to me.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.008
Listen. Do you know
why I don't stay

17:31.217 --> 17:33.185
- in a human body for very long?
- All that messy blood,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.639
coursing through your veins,
all those feelings and urges...

17:35.846 --> 17:38.065
You probably need a nice
shower in heavenly light

17:38.266 --> 17:40.109
- afterwards, don't you?
- John...

17:40.309 --> 17:41.561
when I am in a body

17:41.769 --> 17:43.771
I lose contact
with the heavenly host,

17:43.980 --> 17:46.153
its vast stores of knowledge,

17:46.357 --> 17:47.449
and, more importantly,

17:47.650 --> 17:49.493
all of my angelic powers.

17:49.694 --> 17:53.449
Well, it's not like you were
using them anyway, is it, chief?

17:53.656 --> 17:55.408
(light buzzing)

17:55.616 --> 17:56.663
Again.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.414
What?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.496
Another sign of dark matter.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.673
It interferes with illumination.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.841
You can follow it like
a trail of bread crumbs.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.965
Come on, boots.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.591
(sighs)

18:11.799 --> 18:14.018
(lights buzzing, crackling)

18:20.850 --> 18:22.693
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

18:22.893 --> 18:24.236
Hey, Doc.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.774
What... what are you...?

18:29.275 --> 18:29.741
(beeping)

18:29.942 --> 18:30.408
What are you doing?

18:38.743 --> 18:40.996
Newsflash: people can see you.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.672
Try not to draw attention to us.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.092
By the look of things,
we missed this bastard

18:46.292 --> 18:47.635
by a few minutes.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.462
John,

18:49.670 --> 18:51.047
this is all... it's...

18:51.255 --> 18:52.677
Oh, come on.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.259
Don't tell me
you're bloody squeamish.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.266
I've seen death before...

18:57.470 --> 19:00.223
that smell...

19:00.431 --> 19:02.104
(retching) 'Oh, yeah,
that's great, go ahead.'

19:02.308 --> 19:03.560
'Just contaminate
the crime scene.'

19:06.646 --> 19:08.239
'That's the thing
about being mortal.'

19:08.439 --> 19:09.486
You can't just flap out

19:09.690 --> 19:11.442
when things get rough.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.154
And this here, this is rough.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.081
This wasn't a clean murder;
this was a bloody savaging.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.954
Hold on a second.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.041
Ah...

19:23.245 --> 19:24.713
Come on.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.215
CONSTANTINE: Heart of darkness.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.387
Most of these mystic "tells, “"

19:32.588 --> 19:33.760
they're not so literal,

19:33.964 --> 19:35.056
but this one...

19:35.257 --> 19:36.099
The Black Diamond caused this.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.643
You know the legend, then?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.345
It's not a legend, John.
I was there.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.770
A sorcerer amassed
infernal power.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.567
Claimed to be a god.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.611
Plagues fell, crops withered,

19:47.812 --> 19:49.439
children perished.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.820
Finally, the people cried
out to the Almighty Father

19:52.024 --> 19:54.277
and a shaft of heavenly light
was released.

19:54.485 --> 19:56.032
The sorcerer was destroyed

19:56.195 --> 19:59.825
and his dark power hardened
into a pure mass...

20:00.032 --> 20:02.751
a black diamond of radiant evil.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.671
An angel's fiery sword
shattered the diamond,

20:05.871 --> 20:08.090
so that no one man could
ever wield it again.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.669
All this around the time your
boss decided to turn on the tap.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.345
The Great Flood spread

20:13.546 --> 20:14.638
the diamond fragments
all around the world.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.512
Every time one was found...

20:16.716 --> 20:18.093
Death followed.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.270
And the victims ended up
like this poor sod.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.687
All right.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.694
Oi. Come on.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.530
(lights buzzing)

20:37.445 --> 20:39.743
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

20:44.243 --> 20:46.041
What? If the police
get involved,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.997
they'll close the ward
and kick me to the curb.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.627
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to let Drunken Duncan

20:49.832 --> 20:51.505
steep for the time being.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.882
But would it hurt you to
show respect? A man is dead.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.305
Yeah, and he won't be the only
one if we don't find our killer.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.927
There's no sign
of forced entry on that door.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.136
I reckon we're
looking for someone

21:02.344 --> 21:04.187
that has or stole a key card.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.140
And a Black Diamond
with infernal power.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.770
You know, locking me
in this body,

21:07.933 --> 21:08.604
you're putting us in danger.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.439
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.728
Bygones be bygones.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.361
Oh, and speaking
of infernal power.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.442
Can you use a computer?

21:16.650 --> 21:17.492
I have a general knowledge...

21:17.693 --> 21:18.569
Uh, save it.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.872
I need you to look up Taylor
and this orderly Duncan.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.243
See if they have
anything else in common,

21:22.448 --> 21:24.416
besides the fact
they both died here

21:24.617 --> 21:26.494
in the bosom of the lovely
St. Catherine, all right?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.670
John?

21:28.871 --> 21:32.546
Dr. Bob Carroll, anesthesiology.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.673
Exceflent

21:34.877 --> 21:36.879
You can free reign
of all these halls, Doc.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.304
Use them wisely.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.600
When I get my wings back...
(groans)

21:42.468 --> 21:44.766
(footsteps approaching)

21:46.680 --> 21:47.431
What are you doing back?

21:47.640 --> 21:48.391
Following up on a lead.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.567
You find anything
in Jasper's papers?

21:50.768 --> 21:52.065
Yeah, I'm working on it.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.612
His filing system leaves
a lot to be desired.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.156
All right, well, you stay at it.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.199
Got to be here somewhere.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.616
How's Zed?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.115
Any word after the CAT scan?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.242
Aah! Bloody Jasper!

22:02.446 --> 22:03.538
Never makes things easy!

22:03.739 --> 22:04.865
I tried calling the hospital.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.246
But no one answered in her room.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.077
Reception didn't tell me squat.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.081
(mumbling)

22:09.286 --> 22:10.162
John!

22:12.122 --> 22:13.499
Talk to me.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.173
She has a brain tumor, Chas.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.801
Over the temporal lobe.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.723
It's language, emotion, memory

22:21.924 --> 22:24.143
and, uh...

22:24.343 --> 22:27.096
visions.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.398
Someone should be with her.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.350
She's resting.

22:31.559 --> 22:34.062
This is our priority now.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.487
What's that?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.361
Well, according
to this label here,

22:37.565 --> 22:39.659
this box contains a fragment
of the Black Diamond.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.157
And hopefully the answer
to whatever's laying waste

22:42.361 --> 22:44.614
to those poor sods
at the hospital.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.043
Dr. Carroll?

22:50.244 --> 22:51.666
Can I help you with something?

22:51.871 --> 22:54.545
Oh, yeah, Brad showed me how
to get the patient files, but

22:54.707 --> 22:57.130
every time I, I hit print,

22:57.334 --> 22:59.837
I get the little
swirly pinwheel.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.137
NURSE (over intercom):
'Nurse Bailey to pediatrics.'

23:01.338 --> 23:02.715
'Nurse Bailey to pediatrics.'

23:02.923 --> 23:04.345
(printer whirring)

23:06.552 --> 23:08.896
That was humbling.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.518
Nothing wrong
with being a Luddite.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.191
I actually find it refreshing.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.189
(chuckles)

23:14.393 --> 23:15.565
Go get me the damn doc!

23:15.769 --> 23:17.521
Is he always like that?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.653
Mr. Morris keeps me on my toes.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.076
Thank God it's my break.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.153
You know, those aren't
the most current files.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.989
If you'd like, I can
pull the charts for you.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.744
Oh, yeah.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.451
If it's no trouble, I...

23:30.659 --> 23:32.912
appreciate that, that's...

23:33.078 --> 23:35.172
that's, uh...

23:35.372 --> 23:36.669
Yeah.

23:36.874 --> 23:39.593
(over P.A.):
Lab technician to 0R6.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.844
Lab technician to 0R6.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.137
Whoa!

23:46.383 --> 23:47.555
(passionate moan)

23:47.760 --> 23:49.728
Oh, I hate the game
we have to play

23:49.929 --> 23:51.397
when we're in front
of the others,

23:51.597 --> 23:54.191
Dr. Carroll.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.644
I don't know about you,

23:56.852 --> 23:58.274
but my clay has been one

23:58.479 --> 24:00.447
long sprint through hell.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.321
And the only thing
that got me through it

24:02.524 --> 24:04.652
was imagining you...

24:04.860 --> 24:05.736
and me...

24:05.945 --> 24:07.413
right here.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.739
Wha...?

24:08.948 --> 24:10.200
Right now.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.580
(grunting) Now?

24:15.871 --> 24:16.872
Now.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.550
But...

24:19.750 --> 24:21.002
I...

24:21.210 --> 24:22.006
(zipper unzips)

24:22.211 --> 24:24.930
Oh, now! Now!

24:27.967 --> 24:29.435
What's the plan?

24:29.635 --> 24:31.182
The pieces of this Black
Diamond are basically

24:31.387 --> 24:33.185
calcified evil.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.732
All I know is that a human being

24:34.932 --> 24:36.775
isn't supposed to
touch it, because...

24:36.976 --> 24:38.853
well, that's
what I want to find out.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.904
Why? What happens?

24:41.105 --> 24:42.402
You need a guinea pig.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.903
I prefer the term
"test subject."

24:44.108 --> 24:44.904
And, uh,

24:45.109 --> 24:46.531
only if you're game.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.237
Well, I've already
been stabbed once today.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.867
What do I do?

24:54.076 --> 24:56.625
(clicking, whirring)

25:09.758 --> 25:11.556
All you have to do, mate,
is, uh...

25:11.760 --> 25:13.012
(clears his throat)

25:13.178 --> 25:14.976
you hold the diamond.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.434
Well, what's with the gun?

25:18.642 --> 25:20.269
It's just a precaution,
you know.

25:20.477 --> 25:23.151
Worst case scenario.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.778
All right. Well...

25:25.983 --> 25:27.155
let's get this over with.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.611
Hmm.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.750
(deep groaning)

25:45.794 --> 25:48.297
Chas, I think you better
drop the stone!

25:50.090 --> 25:52.513
Chas, you need
to drop the stone, all right?!

25:52.718 --> 25:55.517
Chas, mate, drop
the bloody stone, will you?!

25:55.721 --> 25:57.268
Drop the stone!

25:57.473 --> 25:58.690
(grunting)

25:58.891 --> 26:01.644
(growling)

26:03.145 --> 26:04.772
(yelling)

26:06.648 --> 26:09.572
(grunting)

26:09.777 --> 26:12.121
Sorry about that, mate.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.415
Oh.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.413
Did you get
what you were looking for?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.873
Uh... yeah.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.331
Unfortunately, I think I did.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.344
Did you page me?

26:31.548 --> 26:32.424
Yeah.

26:32.633 --> 26:33.725
What?

26:33.926 --> 26:34.973
You know what a shard

26:35.177 --> 26:37.179
of Black Diamond
does to a human?

26:37.387 --> 26:39.685
It brings out their rage,
doubles their strength,

26:39.890 --> 26:41.813
and makes a man want to murder.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.610
(sniffing)

26:45.187 --> 26:47.030
Are you wearing perfume?

26:47.231 --> 26:48.448
What?

26:48.649 --> 26:49.901
(laughs)

26:50.109 --> 26:51.577
You see that? You
see that what you're

26:51.777 --> 26:52.949
feeling there, that's,

26:53.153 --> 26:54.370
that's embarrassment.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.868
It's socialized, not innate.

26:56.073 --> 26:56.699
And trust me, it's not worth it.

26:56.907 --> 26:57.533
Look.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.209
I feel... guilty.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.251
Oh, you feel guilty.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.328
The man's body had

27:01.537 --> 27:03.335
all these feelings, and I used
a woman to extinguish them.

27:03.539 --> 27:04.756
You mean you made

27:04.957 --> 27:08.052
two poor sods feel pleasure.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.845
Momentary relief from the,
uh, tragedy of everyday living.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.548
That doesn't sound like
a sin to me, mate.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.555
But then again, you know, I wasn't
around when they made those rules.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.761
Do what thou wilt.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.643
It's too much, John. I want out!

27:19.847 --> 27:21.099
Yeah, well, your
time's not done!

27:21.306 --> 27:22.307
It's out of my power,

27:22.516 --> 27:23.733
as you're so fond of saying.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.982
Now, I know it's hard.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.530
All those chemicals
swirling around.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.609
Your heart aches,
your head hurts,

27:31.817 --> 27:34.070
makes it hard to
concentrate, doesn't it?

27:34.278 --> 27:35.700
Yeah, I don't know
how you get anything done.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.952
A little bit of denial
and a whole lot of gin.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.376
Oh, did you get those
files or were you, uh,

27:40.576 --> 27:42.044
too busy playing doctor?

27:42.244 --> 27:43.962
(chuckles)

27:44.163 --> 27:45.335
Taylor and Duncan
both had a problem

27:45.539 --> 27:47.758
with substance abuse.
They went here,

27:47.958 --> 27:49.676
at St. Catherine's.
The orderly, Duncan?

27:49.877 --> 27:51.629
His brother gave him
part of a liver.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.010
He still went back to drinking.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.467
Two addicts made it to sobriety,
only to fall off the wagon.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.677
Well, that's a pattern
shared by our victims.

27:58.886 --> 28:02.436
I never understood it when
mortals waste a second chance.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.437
It makes me angry. It's...

28:04.641 --> 28:08.145
Maybe it makes the killer angry.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.151
Madness. Anger.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.736
On your rounds,
did you notice anyone

28:15.944 --> 28:18.538
who was full of suppressed rage?

28:18.739 --> 28:20.082
- Morris... patient with skin grafts.
- Yes.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.000
Linda told me

28:22.201 --> 28:23.623
that he fell asleep halfway
through a bottle of beer

28:23.827 --> 28:26.000
and a cigarette,
set his house on fire.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.582
Wife and kids died, he survived.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.041
Now he terrorizes everyone.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.717
Abusive, abrasive...

28:30.918 --> 28:32.261
I'll deal with Morris.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.508
You check on Zed.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.679
Whoa.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.517
She-she's ill, John.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.469
If you can't talk to her now,

28:40.677 --> 28:42.520
when can you?

28:49.353 --> 28:52.903
What if I can live
with the headaches?

28:53.106 --> 28:54.858
I still recommend the biopsy
just to be safe.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.115
Dr. Carroll, great.

28:57.319 --> 28:58.696
Zed, this is Dr. Carroll.

28:58.904 --> 28:59.746
You can call me Bob.

28:59.947 --> 29:00.823
He'll be handling your

29:01.031 --> 29:02.203
anesthesia in the morning.
Zed here was just

29:02.407 --> 29:03.283
feeling a little nervous

29:03.492 --> 29:04.789
about the procedure.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.667
Not about the biopsy...
The surgery.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.215
Removing the tumor?
I might not want to do that.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.089
I understand how scary this must
seem to you, believe me.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.510
But it's a very small mass.

29:14.711 --> 29:15.758
It's accessible.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.260
And the surgeons here?

29:17.464 --> 29:18.807
They do this procedure
all the time.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.975
What if it's supposed
to be there?

29:21.176 --> 29:22.723
You don't want something
in your body

29:22.928 --> 29:24.180
that could take your life
at anytime.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.943
Shrapnel, half inch
from my heart.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.485
Too close to cut out.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.279
You served in the military?

29:32.479 --> 29:34.402
I was a corpsman
in Baghdad, yes.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.404
I stitched up
soldiers and civilians.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.407
When the lEDs hit,
I was in the secondary blast.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.705
But I lived. I was lucky.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.657
You're lucky, Zed.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.162
The fact that we
found this early?

29:45.367 --> 29:47.119
It's a blessing.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.328
I'll be back.

29:48.537 --> 29:50.005
Just think it over.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.007
Who are you?

29:56.211 --> 29:57.963
Interesting.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.844
You can tell?

30:00.048 --> 30:01.641
I'm a sensitive.
You're not a doctor.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.518
Who are you?

30:05.178 --> 30:08.398
You'd know me as Manny.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.352
Are you here for me?

30:11.560 --> 30:14.188
Am I going to die?

30:14.396 --> 30:17.024
Ooh. All humans die.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.575
As to your time,

30:18.775 --> 30:20.903
I don't have
the answers for that.

30:21.111 --> 30:24.035
John grounded me in
this body and ljust

30:24.239 --> 30:26.583
wanted to see how you were.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.206
He sent you?

30:29.411 --> 30:32.255
John has a hard time
communicating his feelings.

30:32.456 --> 30:35.050
I know.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.127
Can I ask you another question?

30:37.336 --> 30:39.555
Of course.

30:39.755 --> 30:40.927
My visions?

30:41.131 --> 30:42.474
Are they a gift from God?

30:42.674 --> 30:45.928
Or do my abilities
come from somewhere

30:46.136 --> 30:49.140
evil and the tumor is my...

30:49.348 --> 30:52.067
punishment?

30:52.267 --> 30:55.271
Do you think
your powers are evil?

30:55.479 --> 30:58.733
Sometimes they feel that way.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.989
But since I met John, I...

31:02.194 --> 31:05.619
I've been able to use them
to save lives.

31:05.822 --> 31:09.452
And if this is my gift,
I'll put up with the pain.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.536
Exactly.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.299
So my visions do come from God?

31:20.379 --> 31:22.222
Like I said,

31:22.422 --> 31:24.220
John grounded me in this body.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.222
So I'm cut off from my power,

31:26.426 --> 31:29.896
but based on what
you've told me, Zed,

31:30.097 --> 31:32.350
you have all the
answers you need.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.739
Morris, you shouldn't
be smoking here

31:46.905 --> 31:48.407
or anywhere; get back in bed!

31:48.573 --> 31:50.325
(light crackles)

31:50.534 --> 31:52.753
(indistinct chatter)

31:56.289 --> 31:58.542
(light crackles)

32:01.837 --> 32:03.180
(light crackles)

32:03.380 --> 32:04.973
Hey, hey, hey,
have you seen Morris?

32:05.173 --> 32:07.096
A big lad, got a pretty
face, real lady killer.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.517
I'm sorry.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.811
(sighs)

32:18.186 --> 32:20.439
(lights buzzing, crackling)

32:25.819 --> 32:27.321
(screams)

32:29.531 --> 32:31.704
(electrical crackling)

32:31.908 --> 32:33.751
(growling)

32:35.954 --> 32:38.252
(Morris continues screaming)

32:39.624 --> 32:41.046
Halt, you thing of darkness!

32:42.252 --> 32:43.629
By my Power, halt!

32:49.301 --> 32:51.599
(Constantine groans)

32:51.803 --> 32:54.022
CONSTANTINE: Wish you had a bloody
pager when you were an angel.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.145
Would make my life
a hell of a lot easier.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.942
MANNY: You okay?

32:58.143 --> 33:00.521
CONSTANTINE: (groans)
Yeah, only hurts when I breathe.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.529
Here's to hoping you get
to experience pain

33:04.733 --> 33:07.703
before, uh, your tour
of the human condition is done.

33:07.903 --> 33:10.122
What happened?

33:10.322 --> 33:13.121
Well, it turns out that Morris
isn't our killer after all.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.123
Did you see who did it?

33:15.327 --> 33:17.546
I saw a manifestation
of the Black Diamond's evil,

33:17.746 --> 33:19.748
just not the face.

33:19.956 --> 33:23.176
So if Morris isn't the killer,
then we're back to square one.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.925
(sighs)

33:26.129 --> 33:29.258
We are seriously missing
something obvious here.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.093
Zed.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.099
(scoffs)

33:33.303 --> 33:35.772
You're missing Zed, not
just her value to the case,

33:35.972 --> 33:38.100
her value to you as
a source of support.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.434
- I see it all...
- All right.

33:39.643 --> 33:40.519
- Just, you know,
- (laughing): No, no.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.649
Leave it out, will you?

33:41.853 --> 33:42.945
I recognize the sarcasm

33:43.146 --> 33:45.114
masking your true
feelings, John.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.443
That's what I admire about you...
All the darkness you've seen,

33:47.651 --> 33:49.745
and still you have the heart
to do what you do.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.697
What do you want me
to say, Manny, eh?

33:51.905 --> 33:53.623
What do you want me to say?

33:53.823 --> 33:56.372
That I helped her use her
gift, and if the price

33:56.576 --> 33:58.374
of that magic is a bloody tumor
in her brain,

33:58.578 --> 34:00.421
then that's my fault... is
that what you want me to say?

34:01.581 --> 34:02.753
It's not your fault.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.505
You're fighting a war, John.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.211
- Ah...
- Wounds are inevitable.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.842
Now what the bloody hell
do you know about that?

34:09.047 --> 34:11.300
I've been watching mankind
from the beginning, John.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.053
The price of battle
doesn't change.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.980
You should talk to Zed's doctor.

34:17.179 --> 34:19.524
(chuckles) It might
not be a holy war

34:19.724 --> 34:21.101
against the darkness,

34:21.309 --> 34:23.107
but he lost friends
in the front line, too.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.531
Whoa, wh-wh-whoa, wait a minute.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.529
What front lines?

34:28.733 --> 34:30.360
Galen was a corpsman
with the Marines.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.196
He had it pretty rough
over in the Middle East.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.371
- Ah...
- What?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.824
Geez, if he was a snake,

34:35.031 --> 34:36.203
he would have bloody bitten me.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.126
The Black Diamond at Jasper's,

34:38.326 --> 34:40.954
that came from a place
called “Gift from God.“

34:41.161 --> 34:43.085
That translates into Bagh-dadu.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.085
We call it...

34:44.291 --> 34:45.087
- Baghdad.
- Baghdad.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.589
Galen is the killer.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.841
John, he's Zed's doctor.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.933
(knocking on door)

34:53.132 --> 34:54.385
GALEN: Zed?

34:54.592 --> 34:56.344
Yeah?

34:56.553 --> 34:58.396
Are you withdrawing your
consent for the procedure?

34:58.597 --> 35:01.521
Yeah, I'm checking out, Doctor.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.022
You cannot do this.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.569
Yes, I can, it's my decision.

35:04.769 --> 35:05.770
There is no decision, Zed.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.606
This is your second chance.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.657
Do you know how many people
don't get a choice?

35:09.858 --> 35:12.862
You said yourself you don't
know what this mass is.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.616
It may be nothing at all.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.744
But we can't be sure
without the procedure.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.120
We need to know...

35:18.325 --> 35:19.702
Sometimes you can't
know, Doctor.

35:19.909 --> 35:20.956
None of you...

35:21.161 --> 35:22.959
None of you listen.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.540
Oh, another one.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.126
Pissing it all away for
the second time, eh?

35:27.334 --> 35:28.130
What?

35:28.335 --> 35:29.382
Just like Taylor,

35:29.586 --> 35:30.462
Morris, Duncan.

35:30.670 --> 35:31.717
They were healed.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.764
And then they slid back,

35:33.965 --> 35:35.842
and so you killed them.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.599
Are you sure, John?

35:38.803 --> 35:39.929
L-I didn't kill anyone.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.015
Even when I was serving.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.816
I've spent my life healing.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.564
Bob, what is this?

35:45.769 --> 35:47.521
I'm sorry, Tom.
This isn't your fault.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.447
When your unit was hit,
there must have been

35:49.648 --> 35:51.116
a piece of Black
Diamond in the ground.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.784
All right, I don't know
what you three

35:52.984 --> 35:54.702
are up to,
but I'm calling security...

35:54.903 --> 35:56.621
It isn't shrapnel that's
next to your heart, mate.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.038
It's shards of a Black Diamond.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.866
Their pieces drawn together,

36:00.075 --> 36:01.827
and that's the pull you're
feeling right there.

36:03.453 --> 36:04.750
(shouts in pain)

36:05.872 --> 36:06.794
You stay here!

36:11.586 --> 36:14.135
(electrical crackling)

36:15.382 --> 36:17.680
(lights buzzing)

36:22.180 --> 36:24.023
John!

36:26.309 --> 36:27.526
It's burning.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.400
This way.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.823
(lights buzzing)

36:32.023 --> 36:33.650
Wait, wait, he's here?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.280
The diamond wants to reassemble.

36:35.485 --> 36:36.953
It's like a magnet,
pulling us to him.

36:37.153 --> 36:40.202
John, the white light,
I know what it means.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.250
(creaking, slams)

36:42.450 --> 36:43.747
It may be too late
for that, luv.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.876
(snarling)

36:54.254 --> 36:56.803
I should have taken him out
when I had the chance.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.849
Now that he's turned,
we'll never get close to him.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.518
MANNY: If Galen is
still in that body,

37:00.719 --> 37:02.938
maybe we can appeal
to his-his better nature.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.561
I'm sorry to inform you,
but the doctor is not in.

37:05.765 --> 37:06.266
No...!

37:06.474 --> 37:07.020
(groans in frustration)

37:08.393 --> 37:11.021
John, the light in my vision,

37:11.229 --> 37:13.448
the terrifying holy light.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.491
Right?

37:17.610 --> 37:18.907
Manny.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.364
What?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.370
You need to open your shirt.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.496
What?

37:25.243 --> 37:27.120
Hey, what are you doing?
John, what are you doing?

37:27.328 --> 37:28.580
John, listen.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.548
I'm reversing the spell
I cast on you, mate.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.630
- Are you telling me...?
- I could have released you at any time.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.340
We can talk about that later.

37:38.548 --> 37:39.720
(growls)

37:39.924 --> 37:41.016
Hurry up.

37:45.847 --> 37:46.769
(snarling)

37:46.973 --> 37:48.441
(screams)

37:49.726 --> 37:51.148
Just close your eyes, Doc.

37:52.479 --> 37:53.856
Well, that will work as well.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.155
ZED: John, use
the Black Diamond!

37:59.736 --> 38:01.238
- John!
- I have never asked before,

38:01.446 --> 38:02.993
but I am asking you now.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.825
Please,

38:05.033 --> 38:06.125
please.

38:06.326 --> 38:07.543
MANNY: Stop.

38:07.744 --> 38:09.587
Thomas Galen.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.051
Yes.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.549
It's time to come home.

38:17.754 --> 38:21.054
ZED: It's just like my vision.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.884
The heavenly light.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.345
It's the only thing that
can fight dark matter.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.057
Your work here is finished.

38:31.184 --> 38:33.437
Peace is yours.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.658
Your place of rest... awaits.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.059
(chuckles)

39:17.188 --> 39:19.737
Thanks for the assist, old son.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.697
(insects chirping)

39:31.327 --> 39:32.704
(speaking low, indistinctly)

39:32.912 --> 39:34.755
(door opens)

39:46.467 --> 39:49.346
I want to tell you something
about me that nobody knows.

39:51.306 --> 39:52.774
I wake up every morning,

39:52.974 --> 39:56.774
and for the first five
minutes of the day,

39:56.978 --> 40:00.858
I imagine that everyone
I care about is dead.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.864
I lie there, and...

40:04.068 --> 40:06.867
I meditate on that.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.871
So that when it
inevitably happens,

40:11.075 --> 40:14.705
then, uh...

40:14.913 --> 40:17.712
it lessens the blow.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.715
Then what do you do?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.717
I spark a ciggy and fry an 999-

40:22.921 --> 40:25.174
(laughs softly)

40:28.885 --> 40:31.764
So are you telling me
I'm on that list now?

40:34.724 --> 40:36.567
Why don't you just enjoy
your time with them, John?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.441
Ah...

40:38.645 --> 40:40.568
CONSTANTINE: You're up
to your old tricks again.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.319
Manny's here.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.696
I know.

40:44.901 --> 40:46.744
You can see him?

40:51.950 --> 40:55.875
You're... not having
the surgery?

40:59.040 --> 41:01.884
John taught me that...

41:02.085 --> 41:04.804
magic has its cost.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.467
If that cost is pain,

41:08.675 --> 41:11.178
I'll take it.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.764
That's a brave decision.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.940
Ooh, compliments as well.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.485
You have changed, angel.

41:23.731 --> 41:27.326
You never answered my question
about my visions.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.577
Where do they come from?

41:32.865 --> 41:35.288
I'm here, aren't I?

41:37.078 --> 41:38.955
Well, now he's your problem
as well.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.962
Guess I'll just leave you two
to the Almighty.
