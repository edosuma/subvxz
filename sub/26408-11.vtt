You'll survive.

What's your favorite thing
we did in Africa?

00:38.770 --> 00:41.682

all of our friends and family

Okay. Send me an invitation.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.963
If my team thinks
it's as scalable as you say,

01:06.020 --> 01:07.749
I'll have a series A offer
for you

01:07.800 --> 01:09.882
before I leave Barcelona
next week.

01:09.930 --> 01:12.546
So you don't think Rashid
should be starting goalkeeper?

01:12.590 --> 01:15.286
Defense is not the problem.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.838
I thought I told you guys
to clean up at least.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.699
A disaster.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.627
Thanks. Unbelievable.

[wind chimes jingling]

Mikey. Emma.

[grunts]

03:31.380 --> 03:32.938
What are you doing?

03:32.990 --> 03:34.548
Cleaning this up for you.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.942
Pass.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.423
Huh.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.256
There is no "pass."

03:39.300 --> 03:41.120
I'm taking you to the range
'cause you need

03:41.170 --> 03:43.434
to learn how to shoot.No, I don't.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.823
Yes, you do. You need
to learn how to shoot.

03:45.870 --> 03:47.599
What's gonna happen
when Grandma's not here

03:47.660 --> 03:49.878
or I'm not here?
Who do you think's in charge?

03:49.920 --> 03:52.172
You would be the one
who's in charge.I know how to dial 911.

03:52.230 --> 03:53.913
That's great. You know
how to dial 911.

03:53.970 --> 03:55.449
All right, so what happens

03:55.490 --> 03:56.832
when you do dial 911?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.575
How long does it take
for them to get here?

03:58.620 --> 04:00.099
The world's not full
of bad guys.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.448
You only see it that way
because of your job.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.104
Not because of my job,
all right?

04:04.150 --> 04:05.936
You're going to college soon.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.754
I'm not gonna be around
to look after you,

04:07.810 --> 04:10.062
so you need to be prepared.

04:10.110 --> 04:12.726
For what? I'm going
to college, not Yemen.

04:12.770 --> 04:14.670
It's not a joke, Emma.I know.

04:14.730 --> 04:16.721
You want to keep me safe.

04:16.770 --> 04:20.809
But guess what, I am safe.
And so is Mikey.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.862
I don't need a gun.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.773
But if it makes
you feel better,

04:25.830 --> 04:28.390
I'll take Krav Maga classes
or something.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.829
Oh, that makes me feel
a whole lot better.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.704

Hi.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.378
Hi.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.682
I didn't die in Mexico.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.595
[laughs softly]

05:04.650 --> 05:08.825
Um, here's-here's
your-your stuff.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.031
Oh.

05:11.090 --> 05:12.307
Right.

05:12.350 --> 05:14.079
This is everything
that I could find.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.004
Okay.Yeah, I-I could have just

05:17.050 --> 05:18.836
brought this to you.It's all right.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.098
I have a thing in-in town
tonight anyway,

05:21.140 --> 05:23.096
SO...

05:23.140 --> 05:24.539
This looks like
it has everything.

05:24.580 --> 05:25.831
All right.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.050
I'll see you around.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.534
Oh, um, before I forget.

05:31.150 --> 05:33.675
[keys jingling]

05:33.720 --> 05:35.494
I probably shouldn't have this.

05:35.550 --> 05:37.279
[sniffles]

05:48.780 --> 05:50.771
All right.Okay.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.087
Bye, Stella.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.950
Bye.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.661
[lock clicks]

06:25.900 --> 06:30.985
Davis, I feel like Operation
Change of Scenery is a failure,

06:31.040 --> 06:34.555
because the long-lost
Jonas brother is miserable.

06:34.610 --> 06:37.295
Look at those pouty lips.I don't know. Was the
objective to cheer him up

06:37.350 --> 06:39.215
or just to get him out of
that smelly apartment?

06:39.260 --> 06:41.865
[laughs]: Well, if it was smell
we were worried about,

06:41.920 --> 06:43.694
we shouldn't have come
to a place with Natty Light

06:43.750 --> 06:46.435
and three decades
of Drakkar Noir

06:46.490 --> 06:49.448
clinging to the walls.Drakkar Noir.
Well, look,

06:49.490 --> 06:51.446
it is a proven fact
that you cannot dance

06:51.490 --> 06:53.446
and be sad at
the same time.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.660
So...[claps hands]

06:54.710 --> 06:56.439
CLAY: No, not me.Let's go, Clay. Clay.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.058
Absolute... I'm just... No.
Clay, Clay's not a dancer.Come on.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.589
He's not a dancer.
Just not gonna do It.

06:59.630 --> 07:01.416
You realize it is bad manners

07:01.460 --> 07:03.542
to decline a lady's invitation
to dance.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.377
Thank you.Okay, well, then,
why don't you be Mr. Chivalrous

07:06.420 --> 07:07.899
and take the lady
dancing, Sonny?Yeah.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.680
That's gonna be
up to you there, cowboy.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.981
Come on. Put your spurs on.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.770
I'm gonna get us
some more beer.

07:12.820 --> 07:13.980
Get me a whiskey.

07:14.040 --> 07:14.984
I'll get you a cosmo.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.166
Ooh.[Sonny laughs]

07:17.210 --> 07:18.905
All right.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.689
You don't really want
to dance, do you?Oh, hell no.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.082
I'd rather be
bull-kicked in the gut.

07:22.130 --> 07:25.395
Good.Sonny don't dance. No.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.919
Mm.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.009
I saw what
you were doing, though. Hmm?

07:30.050 --> 07:32.393
Doing what?
Oh, yeah.

07:32.450 --> 07:35.180
Trying to make me jealous,
asking that big ol' stud

07:35.230 --> 07:36.481
Clay Spenser to dance.Sonny...

07:36.540 --> 07:37.928
I was just trying
to be a good friend

07:37.970 --> 07:40.359
to someone who needs one.[laughs]

07:40.410 --> 07:43.197
Uh-huh. Yeah.Uh-huh.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.846
Do you want to talk about it?Talk about what?

07:46.900 --> 07:50.063
What happened when
we got back from Mexico.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.337
Oh, you mean when you kissed me?

07:51.380 --> 07:53.848
Uh, hold up, okay?
When we kissed.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.162
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

07:55.210 --> 07:57.815
Yeah, you know,
it was pretty good, too.

07:57.860 --> 08:00.863
Some might actually say
it was great.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.088
What?

08:04.130 --> 08:06.086
It wasn't great?

08:06.130 --> 08:08.439
I would just say
that it can't happen again.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.005
Did I have bad breath?
'Cause I was eating trail mix,

08:11.050 --> 08:13.041
and I probably hadn't
brushed my teeth...

08:13.100 --> 08:15.045
Sonny, you know, I really wish
you'd take this seriously

08:15.100 --> 08:16.920
for just a second.Okay.

08:19.190 --> 08:22.148
And UCMJ says
that that kiss was illegal.

08:22.190 --> 08:24.624
_ And fraterniz_ation
IS a really big Violation,

08:24.670 --> 08:28.549
so was it worth jeopardizing
our careers over?

08:28.590 --> 08:31.764
I feel like this
is a trick question, Davis.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.984
5-1-5-0...

08:35.030 --> 08:36.986
Yeah, come on, man,
you can't deny that this is fun.

08:37.030 --> 08:38.292
Yes, I can.

08:38.340 --> 08:41.639
I have to. We both do.

08:41.690 --> 08:43.646
Okay.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.215
Okay.Mm-hmm.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.511
And it was great.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.992
Yeah, see? I told you it was.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.258

09:48.230 --> 09:49.492
You guys have a good evening.

Only four in history. Come on,
you got a better shot than that.

Too bad it'll be going

just over an hour ago.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.170
Europeans are sending
British SAS forces.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.268
SONNY:
Well, they're gonna get there
seven hours before we do.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.266
Which means the Redcoats
will have a chance

11:52.320 --> 11:54.094
to bag the unicorn
before we land.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.402
MANDY:
Not likely.

11:55.450 --> 11:58.010
There are more European hostages
than Americans,

11:58.060 --> 12:00.233
so the EU is jockeying
for authority.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.407
And they prefer
to negotiate.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.269
What are their demands?Bet you it's
more than

12:04.330 --> 12:06.366
a meat lover's pizza
and a side of wings.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.103
They want
prisoners released.
JASON: Oh.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.582
These guys
hijacked a plane

12:09.640 --> 12:11.892
to leverage a
jailbreak for friends?50 friends...

12:11.940 --> 12:15.376
in prisons in the U.S., U.K.,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

12:15.430 --> 12:18.900
And they want them transported
to their plane in Doha.

12:18.950 --> 12:20.554
In exchange for the hostages?

12:20.600 --> 12:23.603
Well, that makes our job easy;
we just wait till the hostages

12:23.650 --> 12:26.380
are clear, and then take them.They are also
demanding fuel

12:26.440 --> 12:27.998
and clearance to take off.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.302
If their demands aren't
met within 24 hours,

12:30.350 --> 12:31.749
they will kill
the hostages.

12:32.830 --> 12:34.388
Mandy and I
are already in touch

12:34.440 --> 12:36.522
with our counterparts
on the ground in Doha.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.445
It's gonna be a long flight.
Let's get some rest.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.311
[team chatting lightly]

12:48.410 --> 12:49.843
Hey.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.542
You talk to him
about last night?

12:53.590 --> 12:56.058
Is he all right?Oh, yeah. Last...

12:56.120 --> 12:58.076
Last night was the result of

12:58.120 --> 13:00.372
trying to drink away
a run-in with your ex.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.646
You know, a...

13:02.690 --> 13:05.033
a messy but necessary step

13:05.080 --> 13:07.776
in the relationship
recovery cycle.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.513
What do you know
about relationships?

13:10.570 --> 13:12.344
Oh, easy, Davis.[zipper closes]

13:12.400 --> 13:14.789
He just needs to rub
some dirt on it, walk it off.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.789
Unbelievable.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.784
What'd I do?

13:20.620 --> 13:23.145
So... you figure out when

13:23.190 --> 13:25.499
you're gonna tell
the guys about OCS?[sharp exhale]

13:25.540 --> 13:27.622
You know, I don't leave
for a few more weeks, so...

13:27.670 --> 13:31.322
I'd rather skip the cake-eater
cracks the whole time.

13:32.630 --> 13:34.154
Well, you never know.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.895
They may surprise you.

13:46.430 --> 13:50.548
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

13:55.530 --> 13:57.782
I didn't realize
you were awake.

13:57.830 --> 14:00.481
What, do you think I sleep
sitting up or something? [sighs]

14:00.530 --> 14:02.441
Hungry? Want some?

14:02.490 --> 14:04.446
Not gonna eat that stuff.

14:04.490 --> 14:06.355
You got any updates on anything?

14:06.410 --> 14:07.570
No assault yet.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.269
SAS standing by.All right.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.185
When we land, we'll give them
a good push, huh?

14:11.240 --> 14:12.537
Get them going.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.660
It's a partner op, Jason.
We're equals.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.494
I'm not in charge;
I don't think

14:16.550 --> 14:18.359
we should be throwing our weight
around on this one.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.899
I know how to play nice.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.892
What?

14:22.940 --> 14:24.817
You really think I'm gonna
mess up a partner op?

14:26.730 --> 14:29.290
Questions are being asked
about what happened in Mexico.

14:29.340 --> 14:31.513
Mexico's done. It's finished.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.073
All right?
Anyone who didn't have boots

14:33.130 --> 14:35.212
on that ground...
they can't judge.

14:36.650 --> 14:37.912
Brass is just doing their jobs.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.780
And that means
that eyes will be on us.

14:39.830 --> 14:41.309
So...

14:41.350 --> 14:43.432
You want me to play nice?Hmm.

14:43.490 --> 14:44.832
Yeah, well...

14:44.880 --> 14:46.962
I'll play nice.Thank you.

14:47.010 --> 14:49.058
Doesn't mean I like it,
but I'm gonna play nice.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.447
Get some rest.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.336
Are you in charge of
the EU's interests here?

15:12.380 --> 15:13.688
I am. Claire North.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.732
Mandy Ellis.Commander Blackburn.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.736
Why hasn't an assault
been ordered?

15:18.870 --> 15:21.782
Because so far, negotiations
are yielding results.

15:22.870 --> 15:24.565
The hijackers have
been reasonable.

15:24.610 --> 15:26.430
They've agreed
to an hourly check-in

15:26.490 --> 15:29.573
with a hostage negotiator from
Qatar's Ministry of Defense,

15:29.620 --> 15:32.134
and at each one,
they've made concessions.

15:32.190 --> 15:35.705
Such as?They allowed the airport
to resume operations.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.887
They agreed to free
half of the hostages

15:37.930 --> 15:39.886
before they leave,
as opposed to all of them

15:39.930 --> 15:41.329
after they land in Iran.

15:41.370 --> 15:42.849
And as the U.S.
and Israel

15:42.890 --> 15:45.029
are not releasing
prisoners,

15:45.070 --> 15:47.118
next, we need to ask them
to reduce the number

15:47.160 --> 15:49.469
they want in exchange
for the hostages.

15:49.510 --> 15:50.727
What's an acceptable number

15:50.770 --> 15:52.681
of terrorists to release
back into the world?

15:53.730 --> 15:55.038
I've seen their list.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.685
British embassy
siege in Riyadh,

15:57.730 --> 15:58.867
51 victims.

15:58.910 --> 16:00.468
Paris school bombing,

16:00.520 --> 16:02.647
112 teachers
and children killed.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.123
Hamza al-Moussa_ attacked
a mosque here In Doha.

16:05.180 --> 16:06.659
37 victims, and that is just

16:06.700 --> 16:09.214
a fraction of the
blood on the hands

16:09.270 --> 16:13.354
of everyone your reasonable
hijackers want freed.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.960
I understand that we're
dragging our heels

16:16.010 --> 16:17.181
on the assault
because we want

16:17.230 --> 16:19.278
to protect the innocent lives
on that plane.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.538
But let's make_ sure
that our negotiations

16:21.580 --> 16:24.583
don't ignore the innocent lives
that will be lost

16:24.630 --> 16:26.973
if you give in to their demands.

16:29.460 --> 16:31.280
Your concerns are noted.

16:35.550 --> 16:36.858
Right, yes, so we
breach in here,

16:36.900 --> 16:38.902
left and right...Sir, the Americans.

16:38.950 --> 16:40.679
Master Chief Jason Hayes.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.254
Sergeant Major Nigel Wickham.

16:43.950 --> 16:45.599
Sorry, we thought
when they said

16:45.650 --> 16:48.084
American special operations
that Delta was gonna come.

16:48.130 --> 16:50.655
This is their area
of expertise, no?

16:52.440 --> 16:54.749
Look, don't get caught up
on the color of the uniform.

16:54.790 --> 16:56.223
We all train the same, so...

16:56.270 --> 16:57.578
Any news on the assault?

16:58.660 --> 17:00.400
Uh, yeah, we're still
fine-tuning a plan.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.315
Now, is that Brit slang
for wasting time?

17:02.360 --> 17:03.668
There's no way

17:03.710 --> 17:05.530
they're gonna get green-lit
for this assault.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.195
NIGEL: Right, well,
uh, in our country,

17:07.240 --> 17:09.800
we like to save lives
any way necessary.

17:09.850 --> 17:11.067
Even diplomacy.

17:11.110 --> 17:12.805
Well, it sounds
like caving in to me.

17:12.850 --> 17:14.670
Sonny.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.631
Look”.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.808
U.S. doesn't negotiate
with terrorists ever,

17:19.860 --> 17:21.760
but we're here
to help and as5ist,

17:21.820 --> 17:23.776
so tell us what you have.

17:25.470 --> 17:27.210
Right, well,
we're thinking of breaching

17:27.260 --> 17:30.081
the ovenNing emergency exits,
splitting left and right,

17:30.130 --> 17:32.086
_ and then we'll clear
in opp05ite directions.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.086
What about the cockpit?

17:34.140 --> 17:36.131
Hijacker behind
that fortified door,

17:36.180 --> 17:38.353
soon as he hears you guys
coming in blazing guns,

17:38.400 --> 17:40.448
he's gonna kill the pilot
and the copilot.

17:40.490 --> 17:41.650
One of our snipers
will take him out

17:41.710 --> 17:43.314
with a .50-caliber round
soon as we breach.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.702
.50? Way too big.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.923
Go right through Tango,
could injure the hostages.

17:46.970 --> 17:49.757
Mm, well, the windscreen glass
is 22 millimeters thick.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.973
Anything smaller than a .50
won't penetrate.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.806
Use two snipers,

17:55.850 --> 17:57.545
300 Win Mags,
simultaneous shots.

17:57.590 --> 17:59.114
Both bullets won't hit
at the same time,

17:59.160 --> 18:01.799
first one will weaken the glass,
second takes out the Tango.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.169
No risk of overpenetration
and collateral damage.

18:06.730 --> 18:08.686
That's a good idea, Ray.

18:08.730 --> 18:09.867
Assuming we're cleared hot,

18:09.910 --> 18:11.639
we have to make sure
that our assault team

18:11.690 --> 18:13.476
is around the same FREQs
and crypto.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.215
Petty Officer Davis here
will make sure that...

18:15.260 --> 18:18.081
we're coordinated
with your comms.NIGEL: Okay.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.300
You two are snipers?

18:19.350 --> 18:21.261
Right. You're gonna
link up with Rufus,

18:21.310 --> 18:23.744
and you're gonna work out
the cockpit problem.

18:23.790 --> 18:25.348
Master Chief,
when you're ready, let's get

18:25.400 --> 18:26.799
the rest of your boys
briefed.

18:26.840 --> 18:27.920
Let's go.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.286
It's Wentz and Foles,
brother.

18:38.330 --> 18:39.809
Both great QBs,

18:39.850 --> 18:41.989
both can't call the play
at the same time.

18:48.690 --> 18:51.853
Charlie 1, this is Bravo 3.
I pass Chelsea. How copy?

18:51.910 --> 18:54.162
NIGEL: Bravo 3, this is
Charlie 1. That's a good copy.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.381
It's time for kickoff.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.705
[panting]: Charlie 1,
this is Bravo 3.

19:14.760 --> 19:15.977
I pass Arsenal.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.147
JASON: 3, this is 1.
You got no shot on goal.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.804
First class is dead. ENDEX.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.010
ENDEX, ENDEX.

19:21.070 --> 19:22.196
EN DEX.
EN DEX.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.376
EN DEX.

19:29.990 --> 19:31.207
NIGEL: What do you
think, Master Chief?

19:31.250 --> 19:33.070
We were close, the entry
was strong, but...

19:33.120 --> 19:34.599
JASON:
Too damn slow is what it is.

19:34.650 --> 19:36.333
Mind your step, Master Chief.Too slow. My-my step?

19:36.390 --> 19:38.039
I did not call the exercise...Okay, look.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.082
We take that long to clear,
we're gonna kill hostages.

19:40.130 --> 19:41.518
Real simple. What we need
is an explosive breach.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.049
Much faster;
go in through the front

19:43.090 --> 19:44.569
and the rear of the plane.Right.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.396
Okay, mate, and then, if the
explosives over-pressurize

19:46.440 --> 19:48.874
the cabin, we risk injuring
the hostages.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.444
Kairos?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.219
The chance of injury from
over-pressurization is small.

19:52.270 --> 19:53.669
It's worth the risk.

19:53.710 --> 19:54.927
Not in my opinion.

20:00.020 --> 20:01.191
Look, this is what we do.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.844
We send in a group
with a fuel truck.

20:02.890 --> 20:04.619
We disguise them
as ground crew,

20:04.680 --> 20:06.068
then we distract
the hijackers.

20:06.110 --> 20:07.634
That will give us
time for the breach.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.238
What is this, 1977?

20:09.290 --> 20:13.021
That may have worked
for the German GSG 9, but...

20:13.080 --> 20:16.072
we don't exactly look like
Qatari mechanics, now, do we?

20:18.120 --> 20:19.997
With all due respect,
Master Chief,

20:20.040 --> 20:22.554
this is an SAS operation,
and that means I'm in charge.

20:22.610 --> 20:24.475
SAS operation.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.511
Doesn't mean you don't
have to listen, though.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.265
[Jason groans]Everything okay?

20:34.320 --> 20:36.447
I just need some air.
I need a breath.

20:36.490 --> 20:39.960
It's not easy dancing
backwards in high heels.

20:40.020 --> 20:43.183
We have no assault plan.
We have eight hours to deadline.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.969
That's assuming
the hijackers

20:45.020 --> 20:46.499
stick to their plan.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.281
So, do you really not trust
the sergeant major,

20:50.330 --> 20:51.809
or is this...

20:51.850 --> 20:53.806
because you're
usually the boss

20:53.860 --> 20:56.203
making these decisions?

20:56.250 --> 20:59.299
This is not some alpha
male pissing contest.
[laughs]

20:59.340 --> 21:02.298
Come on.
It's not about ego;
it's about control.

21:02.340 --> 21:05.810
Letting someone else lead my
team puts their lives in danger.

21:05.870 --> 21:07.565
I'm not there,
I can't protect them.

21:07.610 --> 21:09.566
I wasn't there
in Mumbai,

21:09.610 --> 21:12.829
look what happens--
we lose Adam.

21:14.220 --> 21:15.778
[sighs]
Sergeant major,

21:15.830 --> 21:18.310
he-he knows
what he's doing.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.399
Okay, then.
I got to go.

21:29.370 --> 21:30.758
Target set.

21:30.810 --> 21:34.234
Clay, double-check
the range.

21:34.290 --> 21:36.588
Yeah. Roger,
it's, uh...

21:36.640 --> 21:38.722
all good, 200 meters.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.298
All right, let's go hot,
check our zeros.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.119
Range is hot.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.248
Right, the senior chief
and I will take the shot.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.155
Copy.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.901
I'm going down range,
make sure the windshield is set.

22:27.950 --> 22:29.201
Yeah.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.522
You want to talk about it?

22:38.570 --> 22:40.344
No.

22:42.750 --> 22:46.004
Never seen you shoot a group
like that. Not your style.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.751
[grunts]
Look, brother.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.367
We all have faith
in something, right?

22:57.410 --> 23:00.971
Whether it's
religion, sports,

23:01.030 --> 23:03.419
politics,
husbands, wives.

23:03.460 --> 23:06.759
We lose that,
we flounder.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.118
Takes a moment
to get back right.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.115
That's the problem
with relying on anything

23:11.170 --> 23:14.298
other than
yourself, Clay.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.388
Trust yourself.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.994
Mm-hmm.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.302
All right, Ray.

23:22.350 --> 23:25.080
Look, you and, uh... you and
Rufus, you all take the shot.

23:25.140 --> 23:26.391
I'm gonna spot.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.741
All right.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.322
I ran your concerns
about releasing prisoners

23:39.370 --> 23:40.758
up the proverbial
flagpole,

23:40.810 --> 23:43.233
and the powers that be
agree with your assessment.

23:43.290 --> 23:46.066
There's to be no capitulating
to the hijackers' demands.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.247
So we're cleared hot
for an assault?
Yeah.

23:48.290 --> 23:50.076
How soon will your teams
be ready to launch?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.294
We're approaching
the next check-in.

23:56.340 --> 23:58.945
If we're not ready to launch
an assault right away,

23:59.000 --> 24:00.126
I need to give
the negotiator something,

24:00.170 --> 24:01.478
some way to stall them.

24:03.310 --> 24:05.824
Have him tell the hijackers
that we're organizing

24:05.870 --> 24:08.338
the release of the prisoners,
as they demanded,

24:08.400 --> 24:11.619
but we're gonna need
proof of life.

24:11.660 --> 24:14.185
A live video of the hostages.

24:14.230 --> 24:16.095
That should buy us some time.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.703
And it'll get us eyes
inside that plane.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.012
Let's just hope
the hijackers agree to it.

24:22.060 --> 24:25.143
MAN: We are respecting
these people's lives.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.158
[second man speaking Arabic]

24:28.200 --> 24:30.327
MAN: We fed them.
They have food.

24:30.380 --> 24:31.540
They have water.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.158
[second man speaking Arabic]

24:33.210 --> 24:34.814
We've identified four hijackers.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.426
Looks like there's a fifth.

24:37.470 --> 24:38.596
MAN:
They are safe.

24:38.650 --> 24:40.299
NIGEL: The arm at the edge
of the frame?

24:40.340 --> 24:41.682
MAN:
They will remain safe

24:41.740 --> 24:44.868
as long as you live up
to your end of the bargain,

24:44.910 --> 24:47.253
and our brothers are released
and brought back home.

24:47.310 --> 24:50.393
[frantic chatter and screaming]

24:54.530 --> 24:56.964
[gunshots, screaming]CLAIRE: Oh, my God.

24:57.010 --> 24:58.568
JASON:
They shot two.

24:58.620 --> 25:00.440
[woman screaming on video]

25:04.670 --> 25:06.661
The aircraft door
is opening.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.545
[murmuring]

25:17.600 --> 25:20.683
I think the time for
talking just passed.

25:31.610 --> 25:32.918
All right, listen up.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.088
The hijackers have accelerated
their timeline.

25:36.140 --> 25:38.574
They will now kill one hostage
every 30 minutes

25:38.620 --> 25:40.099
until their demands are met.

25:41.490 --> 25:42.969
Are we meeting
their demands?

25:43.010 --> 25:44.489
Not yet.

25:44.540 --> 25:46.792
How far away are we,
realistically?

25:46.840 --> 25:48.148
The current plan's too slow.

25:48.190 --> 25:49.589
_ It would result
in an unacceptable

25:49.630 --> 25:50.665
number of casualties.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.800
So you were right.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.579
We need the
explosive breach.

25:53.630 --> 25:56.281
Well, it'll work if we combine
it with your infil method.

25:57.380 --> 25:58.449
Not that you were wrong.

25:58.510 --> 25:59.545
You just weren't exactly right.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.068
That's a clever
distinction.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.202
All right, let's keep in mind
that the clock is ticking.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.592
[knocking]Let's double-time it, fellas.

26:05.650 --> 26:07.868
MANDY: We want you to
talk to the hijackers.

26:07.910 --> 26:09.559
Remind them that
we're still negotiating

26:09.610 --> 26:11.384
for the prisoners
they want released.

26:11.430 --> 26:14.342
But in the meantime, we'll send
a crew to refuel the plane.

26:14.390 --> 26:17.655
An act of good faith.
That could help.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.965
Perhaps even stop them
from shooting someone else.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.968
Tell them the fuel truck
will be ready in an hour.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.577
In actuality, they'll arrive
30 minutes early,

26:28.630 --> 26:30.313
approaching from behind
another vehicle.

26:33.590 --> 26:36.935
We estimate 60 seconds between
the time that the fuel truck

26:36.980 --> 26:39.414
is out in the open and
the hijackers hit the ground.

26:39.460 --> 26:42.588
That's our only window
to get teams in position.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.091
Yalla.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.906
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

27:38.260 --> 27:40.694
Don't really think
you look like airline mechanics.

27:40.740 --> 27:44.085
We're just here to refuel you.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.701
One wrong move,
and we'll blow this whole plane.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.138
Get busy.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.000
Tanks are full.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.568
[over comm]:
Let them leave.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.264
[speaking Arabic]

29:33.160 --> 29:34.889
Havoc, this is 1.
We're passing Man U. How copy?

29:34.940 --> 29:38.023
It's good copy, Bravo 1.
I have Man U.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.150
We have six and a half minutes
till the next check-in

29:40.210 --> 29:43.555
and they kill another hostage.
Good luck. Havoc out.

30:14.070 --> 30:15.674
Six minutes, Bravo 1.

30:15.720 --> 30:19.019
JASON: Be advised, Havoc,
slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

30:22.210 --> 30:24.110
ERIC:
Roger that, Bravo 1.

30:25.430 --> 30:27.898
Bravo 6, this is Charlie 1.
Radio check. Over.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.821
Copy, Charlie 1.
We got eyes on target.

30:34.350 --> 30:36.659
NIGEL:
Okay, Bravo, stand by.

30:52.930 --> 30:56.195
Charlie 1, this is Bravo 3.
I pass Liverpool.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.798
How copy?

30:57.850 --> 31:00.318
Bravo 3, this is Charlie 1.
I copy Liverpool.

31:03.330 --> 31:06.117
Wait, scroll back to the
middle of that shake.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.331
There.

31:08.340 --> 31:09.557
Blackburn.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.381
Oh, they've placed hostages
in front of the exits.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.305
We blow those doors,
we might kill them.

31:21.350 --> 31:22.954
Bravo 6, this is Charlie 1.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.398
On my count.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.227
Three. Two.

31:29.270 --> 31:31.272
ERIC: Charlie 1,
this is Havoc. Stand down.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.969
I say again, stand down.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.105
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Over.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.025
ERIC [over comm]: The hijackers
have placed hostages

31:46.070 --> 31:47.059
in front of the exits.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.508
We cannot blow those doors.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.330
Havoc, this is Charlie 1.

31:50.380 --> 31:51.426
Are you telling us
to abort the mission?

31:51.470 --> 31:52.630
By my count,
we've got four minutes

31:52.690 --> 31:53.725
till they kill another one.

31:53.780 --> 31:54.940
Yeah, that's the call,
Charlie 1.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.467
You need to pull back.

31:58.870 --> 32:01.304
You know, we do that, it's over.
We don't get another shot.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.910
Look, all we have to do is move
the hostages a few feet, right?

32:08.660 --> 32:10.093
Havoc, this is 1.

32:10.140 --> 32:12.392
I may have an idea
how to blow the doors

32:12.450 --> 32:15.442
without hurting the hostages.
Stand by.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.923
Roger that, Bravo 1.
Standing by.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.619
3, this is 1. How many
charges do you have?

32:22.670 --> 32:26.322
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.
We got two slaps and a C6.

32:26.370 --> 32:27.928
Copy that. Get 'em ready.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.722
Go, go.

32:30.770 --> 32:31.850
I take it you've got a plan?

32:31.900 --> 32:33.117
I call it a Philly Philly.

32:39.340 --> 32:42.514
Charlie 3, Charlie 1. The Yanks
are taking the lead on this.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.562
Hand it over to Bravo 2.

32:48.740 --> 32:50.480
Jason, what do you got?

32:50.530 --> 32:53.306
2, this is 1. We're gonna
blow the front landing gear.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.874
On your shots.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.966
Ray, it's on your
call. How copy?

32:58.010 --> 32:59.966
Good copy. How long do you need?

33:00.020 --> 33:01.180
One mike.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.969
Check. One minute out.

33:03.020 --> 33:05.409
You heard the man.

33:05.460 --> 33:08.361
Get on the gun.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.992
2, this is 1. We're set.
On your call.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.179

the pilot and copilot.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.062
All stations, I have control.

Everybody, listen up!

This is a joint
military operation.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.514
I need you to stay calm
and listen to my commands.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.996
On my command, you will stand up
one row at a time.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.645
Your hands will stay in the air,
and if you do not keep them

34:55.700 --> 34:57.736
in the air, you will be shot.

34:57.790 --> 34:59.269
Stand up, this row.

Let's go. Move.
To the back, to the back.This row here.

Move. Come on, let's go.Hands in the air.

35:07.270 --> 35:08.487
Let's go. Go, go.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.225
Nice and easy. Go!

35:20.980 --> 35:23.062
Despite suffering
a 27-hour ordeal,

35:23.120 --> 35:26.669
the hostages are healthy
and in good spirits.

35:26.730 --> 35:28.686
Nice job. You bagged
your unicorn.

35:28.730 --> 35:31.164
Triclq critters, them unicorns.
Tough to catch.

35:31.210 --> 35:33.678
Turns out you need
a hell of a decoy.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.731
Don't touch me.

35:53.970 --> 35:57.974
Qatar and our respective nations
consider the losses acceptable.

35:58.020 --> 35:59.191
They, um...

35:59.240 --> 36:02.152
they're calling
this a win.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.765
No losses are acceptable.

36:07.070 --> 36:09.026
Well, some things are
beyond our control.

36:09.070 --> 36:11.026
Yeah.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.116
Thanks.

36:13.170 --> 36:16.515
This was a win.
Took both of us.

JASON: Just when you thought
you were all alone,

36:42.410 --> 36:44.230
look who's back.[laughs]

36:44.280 --> 36:47.022
You're back.I'm back, huh? I'm back. Yeah.

36:47.070 --> 36:50.119
Why don't you ever call
and say you're back?

36:50.160 --> 36:51.639
Yeah, well, you know,
I love surprising you.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.238
The look on your face
is priceless, anyhow.

36:53.290 --> 36:54.723
Where's your brother?

36:54.770 --> 36:57.159
Mm, playing video games
in his room.Of course he is.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.553
Like a mole person.What is this?

36:59.600 --> 37:01.386
Hasn't senioritis
kicked in already?

37:01.430 --> 37:03.819
I'm prepping for the APs.Prepping for the APs, huh?

37:03.870 --> 37:06.259
If I do well on the exams,
we won't have to pay tuition

37:06.310 --> 37:07.789
for classes that don't teach me
anything new.

37:07.830 --> 37:10.264
Okay, well, I don't want you
to worry about any of this.

37:10.310 --> 37:12.949
Right. You're the only one who
gets to worry or figure out

37:13.010 --> 37:14.307
how to solve problems.That's right.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.351
Ah. [clicks tongue]

37:16.400 --> 37:18.311
What is that,
a concealed carry permit?

37:18.360 --> 37:20.442
Look at that.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.358
Krav Maga.

37:23.410 --> 37:24.923
Right? At the Y.

37:24.980 --> 37:27.369
What's happening here?

37:27.410 --> 37:29.628
I heard you.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.540
Come on, this is me
compromising. Tell you what.

37:33.590 --> 37:36.286
You better take advantage
of this before I change my mind.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.819
So you like my Krav Maga idea?

37:37.860 --> 37:39.816
Yeah, of course, you know,
I'm gonna have to vet

37:39.860 --> 37:42.328
the instructor, obviously,
to make sure he's okay.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.721
I can work with that.

37:43.780 --> 37:45.816
All right.
Sure you don't want a gun?Yes.

37:45.870 --> 37:47.383

for someone?

38:02.060 --> 38:04.528
Uh, a buddy, but
he's-he's late.

38:04.580 --> 38:07.231
So you... yeah,
help yourself.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.363
And I don't care
about the time...

38:10.410 --> 38:13.288
Can I get two more?
Please? Thank you.

38:14.330 --> 38:16.150
What's your name?

38:18.420 --> 38:19.409
What's your name?

38:19.470 --> 38:22.633
[chuckles]
I'm Marcie.

38:22.690 --> 38:24.988
Hi, Marcie.Hi.

38:25.040 --> 38:28.419
[phone chiming]Sorry.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.387
My buddy just blew me off.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.432
You'd be doing me a favor
if you had that beer with me.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.431
Cheers.Cheers.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.664
So you're a SEAL?

38:53.370 --> 38:56.237
Risking your life to go after
the worst of the worst,

38:56.290 --> 38:57.496
what's that like?

38:59.110 --> 39:00.509
How many?

39:00.550 --> 39:01.801
How many what?

39:01.860 --> 39:03.339
How many team guys
have you dated?

39:04.820 --> 39:08.244
My guess is zero, but you want
to know what it's like.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.858
Can you live
with uncertainty?

39:09.910 --> 39:12.344
Put half your life on hold
for a spin-up?

39:12.390 --> 39:13.607
Act like you're cool
about the job

39:13.650 --> 39:15.823
even though it terrifies you?

39:22.960 --> 39:26.043
I'm sorry for whatever
happened to you.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.918
But you should know,
any woman who makes you choose

39:30.970 --> 39:32.790
between her
and the team

39:32.840 --> 39:34.398
is a bitch.

39:34.450 --> 39:38.238
The devil's right there,
right there in the details

39:38.280 --> 39:40.453
And you don't want
to hurt yourself

39:40.500 --> 39:42.502
[exhales, grunting] Hurt yourself

39:45.420 --> 39:47.376
Looking too closely

39:50.990 --> 39:53.072
Looking too closely

39:55.040 --> 39:57.736
No, no, no, no...

40:07.620 --> 40:09.485
Sonny.Yeah.

40:09.530 --> 40:11.088
I have neighbors.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.449
What are you doing? I thought
you're supposed to be out

40:13.490 --> 40:14.479
hound-dogging with
Clay, anyway.

40:14.540 --> 40:17.316
Well, you know.

40:17.370 --> 40:20.009
A beer with you sounded better.

40:22.150 --> 40:25.108
And I lost my house keys.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.503
Oh, you don't know
how to breach a door?

40:27.550 --> 40:28.938
Pick the lock.

40:28.990 --> 40:31.504
Well, I lost my car keys, too.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.169
Uber.

40:38.610 --> 40:41.556
I think I misplaced
my cell phone.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.384
Sonny. . .Yeah?

40:43.440 --> 40:45.305
These are lies.Okay.

40:45.350 --> 40:47.079
You're right, you got me.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.483
All right.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.397
Then tell me
the truth.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.657
Already did.

40:54.710 --> 40:56.962
A beer with you sounded better.

41:01.500 --> 41:05.459
You don't want to
hurt yourself, hurt yourself

41:12.380 --> 41:16.419
You don't want to
hurt yourself, hurt yourself

41:23.080 --> 41:25.696
No, no, no, no

41:40.060 --> 41:41.880
See you around.

41:41.930 --> 41:43.704
Yeah.

41:45.850 --> 41:47.101
See you.

41:47.150 --> 41:49.459
I could be wrong
about anybody else

41:49.500 --> 41:50.717
[door opens]

41:50.760 --> 41:53.149
So don't kid yourself [door closes]

41:53.200 --> 41:54.508
Kid yourself.
