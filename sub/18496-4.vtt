00:17.434 --> 00:19.394
El Gato!

00:36.844 --> 00:39.722
<b>4x04 - Prey Time</b>

01:21.665 --> 01:22.583
Ooh!

01:51.737 --> 01:52.779
Where am I?

01:53.697 --> 01:54.906
How did I get here?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.451
Maybe I should cut down on the leche.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.625
Hello?

02:06.668 --> 02:08.419
Is anyone there?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.757
Anyone?

02:26.355 --> 02:28.815
There is no sign of anyone.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.159
Well, survival comes first.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.619
Hmm.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.287
I wonder if I could build a fire.

02:48.043 --> 02:52.714
Maybe later. I guess I will start
with water, food, and shelter.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.342
Well, maybe this is not so bad.

02:55.592 --> 02:59.930
I am sure all is well back in San Lorenzo
and no one is freaking out.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.475
I'm freaking out! Puss in gone!

03:03.558 --> 03:05.310
Puss!

03:06.019 --> 03:06.978
Ginger?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.606
Puss? Puss?

03:11.483 --> 03:12.359
Sorry.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.194
Boot Cat?

03:19.449 --> 03:20.575
Uh-oh!

03:20.659 --> 03:22.702
Herr Puss?

03:23.286 --> 03:25.247
Like, Puss, or whatever?

03:25.330 --> 03:27.999
Puss? Puss!

03:28.083 --> 03:29.251
Puss!

03:30.293 --> 03:32.421
- Puss!
- Puss!

03:32.504 --> 03:33.630
Puss!

03:33.713 --> 03:35.173
- Puss!
- Puss!

03:35.257 --> 03:39.803
Puss!

03:41.471 --> 03:46.059
We have looked everywhere
and there is no sign of Puss.

03:46.143 --> 03:52.065
This can mean only one thing.
Puss in Boots is dead!

03:53.608 --> 03:54.776
Oh!

03:55.402 --> 03:59.489
Or he is somewhere else. So, two things.

03:59.906 --> 04:03.452
Sorry, that was a little
over-dramatic.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.579
Puss never disappears like this.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.956
I don't like this. I don't like it at all.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.168
Nor do I. Senior Puss Squad,

04:11.251 --> 04:15.630
we must become the Senior Find Puss Squad!

04:17.257 --> 04:19.301
Senior Find Puss Squad...

04:19.384 --> 04:20.844
Go!

04:20.927 --> 04:22.179
- Puss!
- Puss!

04:22.262 --> 04:24.097
- Ginger!
- Puss! Where are you?

04:24.181 --> 04:27.058
Oh. Yeah, okay.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.853
Golem just wait here.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.078
Wonderful. No island getaway
is complete without a hammock.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.707
Looks like I have it all covered.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.294
I can fish if I get hungry.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.303
And I can get fresh water from the tree.

05:07.974 --> 05:08.850
Hmm.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.352
I guess it takes a while.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.655
Hmm.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.541
Whoa!

05:33.250 --> 05:34.709
Whoa!

05:39.839 --> 05:42.133
Well, obviously,
this hammock is defective.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.077
Hello, my...

06:52.329 --> 06:53.246
Get off of me!

06:56.875 --> 06:58.710
What is wrong with you creatures?

07:02.213 --> 07:05.216
Ooh!

07:05.300 --> 07:07.510
Now this...

07:07.594 --> 07:09.804
...is a very nice hat.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.064
And this is for you.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.525
I name thee "Coco."

07:23.610 --> 07:26.780
Come, Coco, my friend.
Let me show you around my humble abode.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.157
This is where I get my fresh water.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.700
Oh.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.410
Thank you. So kind of you.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.329
Yes, yes, I am very clever.

07:34.412 --> 07:38.792
And here, we have a fishing pole,
you know, for uh, for the fishing.

07:39.084 --> 07:43.380
Oh, and over here. This is what I like
to call my "kitty-cat man cave."

07:44.422 --> 07:47.467
You know, Coco,
there is no reason to be uncivilized

07:47.550 --> 07:50.011
even when you're stranded on an island.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.930
Now, would you care for some...

07:54.474 --> 07:55.976
That is not what you think it is.

08:00.563 --> 08:05.110
This is better. So, tomorrow,
we will start building a raft,

08:05.193 --> 08:09.531
and before you know it,
we'll be on our way back to San Lorenzo!

08:10.281 --> 08:12.659
Uh, San Lorenzo!

08:15.620 --> 08:18.373
Anyway, I cannot wait for you
to meet my friends,

08:18.456 --> 08:21.167
Dulcinea, Artephius, the orphans.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.837
Oh, you will love the orphans.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.630
They are so delightful...

08:53.324 --> 08:54.367
Hmm.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.582
Coco! I think someone is after you!

09:01.374 --> 09:02.709
What did you do?

09:54.552 --> 09:56.304
It is all right, Coco.
I think we are safe.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.645
Exorior domi!

10:03.978 --> 10:08.024
Bring back Puss in Boots!

10:12.153 --> 10:13.029
Ooh!

10:13.113 --> 10:16.616
Did I do it? Is he back?
I can't hear anything!

10:16.699 --> 10:18.076
Am I yelling?!

10:24.249 --> 10:27.377
Golem examine cup for clues.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.385
Hmm...

10:48.898 --> 10:51.860
There must be the clues
in here somewhere, ja?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.996
Gasp! Ein ball of yarn!

11:03.580 --> 11:06.207
Could this be... a clue?

11:07.750 --> 11:10.044
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.966
Please tell me
where you last saw Puss in Boots.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.010
I saw Puss on the rooftops.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.303
I saw him with the mayor.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.890
I saw him in the cantina!

11:22.432 --> 11:24.851
You told me you didn't go to the cantina!

11:25.393 --> 11:27.186
I retract my earlier statement.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.524
Someone is hunting me.
How dare they?

11:31.816 --> 11:34.027
I do not like this game of cat and mouse.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.487
Especially when I am the mouse.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.573
Do they not know with whom
they are dealing?

11:38.907 --> 11:39.741
That is it.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.161
Surely the person hunting me
is someone I've wronged in the past.

11:43.912 --> 11:44.829
Perhaps Uli?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.250
Maybe... Fartholomew?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.085
Hmm. Unlikely.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.962
The Scimitar? Doubtful.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.089
The Piper?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.425
No, I reunited her with her sisters.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.094
The Mole King and his army?

12:01.012 --> 12:02.472
El Moco and his thieves?

12:02.555 --> 12:05.099
Skeletons? Mermaids? Pickles?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.310
Parrots? Pigs? Dragons?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.979
Monsters? The Bloodwolf himself?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.446
Or...

12:18.529 --> 12:20.740
none of those. How about you, Coco?

12:20.823 --> 12:21.658
Any enemies?

12:25.244 --> 12:26.788
Of course you have none, my friend.

12:26.871 --> 12:27.914
Whoa!

12:30.333 --> 12:31.334
Hmm.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.586
You are absolutely right, Coco.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.463
I am a cat of action.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.841
So, it is time for the hunted
to become the hunter.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.680
And in this hunt, the once hunted hunter
shall now hunt the hunter turned hunted.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.307
Is that clear? Does that make sense?

13:40.611 --> 13:42.655
I do not think this is working, Coco.

13:43.072 --> 13:43.906
Hmm?

13:45.533 --> 13:48.036
All right, we shall wait a little longer.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.664
Aha!

13:51.748 --> 13:52.999
You were right, my friend.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.333
We got him!

13:59.047 --> 14:04.218
All this time being hunted by a seagull?
I have disgraced myself!

14:04.761 --> 14:06.262
Oh. Good point, Coco.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.057
This bird is probably not the one
trying to kill us.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.249
No! No! No! No!

14:52.683 --> 14:54.143
Will you get out of here?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.436
Whoa!

14:59.399 --> 15:02.318
Perhaps we need to switch...

15:03.027 --> 15:04.070
to live bait.

15:11.828 --> 15:12.662
There we go.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.789
Now, all you have to do is stand there,

15:14.872 --> 15:16.791
and I will handle the rest.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.377
We are going to succeed now,
I am sure of it.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.797
Don't give me that look.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.425
You know I would never let
anything bad happen to you.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.429
See? I will be right here,
behind this rock.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.183
I see that you are still worried,
my friend.

15:34.851 --> 15:38.479
Here, take this. It will give you bravery!

15:40.231 --> 15:41.107
Boop.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.888
No!

16:12.513 --> 16:15.349
I will avenge you!

17:22.458 --> 17:24.335
Whoa!

17:57.159 --> 17:58.619
Okay, everyone,
I know we've been at this nonstop

17:58.703 --> 18:00.288
and nobody has slept for days,
but I'm feeling good.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.205
You feeling good? Yeah?

18:01.289 --> 18:04.542
Never better! I could do this
all day, every day, forever!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.338
Pajuna, we need some more coffee.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.425
So, 12 different people saw Puss
in 12 different places, all...

18:12.508 --> 18:15.219
...on the same day!
So many places. So many places.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.763
It's madness!
No one could be in that many places

18:17.847 --> 18:19.682
all on the same day!

18:19.932 --> 18:23.644
Unless there is more than one
Puss in Boots!

18:24.854 --> 18:27.064
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

18:27.148 --> 18:30.026
That might make sense.
There's Puss, and Puss Dos.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.404
There must be a third, fourth, fifth,
and sixth Puss. So many Pusses!

18:33.487 --> 18:36.782
They're everywhere! It's an invasion!

18:36.866 --> 18:38.326
What about the yarn?

18:38.409 --> 18:40.703
The yarn is the key to everything!

18:40.786 --> 18:42.455
Of course! The yarn!

18:42.538 --> 18:44.248
Talk, yarn! Talk!

18:48.669 --> 18:50.171
Hey, guys. Whatcha doin'?

18:50.254 --> 18:52.506
We're trying to find Puss!

18:53.466 --> 18:54.884
Oh, I know where he is.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.806
Tell us! Tell us where he is! Do it now!

19:00.931 --> 19:05.061
He got knocked out and taken to the jungle
by a tiger who was out for revenge.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.604
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.649
I am so sorry, how do you know this?

19:10.232 --> 19:13.736
I asked the tiger?
Well, we actually had a nice little chat.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.113
You talked to the tiger?

19:16.197 --> 19:17.073
Oh, sure.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.450
That kidnapped Puss?

19:19.533 --> 19:20.576
Yeah?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.412
Why didn't you tell us?!

19:23.496 --> 19:25.873
- You didn't ask!
- I have to go save him!

19:25.956 --> 19:28.167
All this time
when we were looking for Puss...

19:28.250 --> 19:30.920
I never liked him!

19:31.003 --> 19:32.713
Sphinx!

19:32.797 --> 19:34.757
We need to go get Puss!

19:34.840 --> 19:36.008
Like, on it!

19:37.468 --> 19:39.595
So, am I on the team now?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.893
Aw, I just want to have friends.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.232
Surprised to see me, Puss?

19:52.066 --> 19:53.109
Victoria!

19:54.402 --> 19:55.236
No!

19:55.319 --> 19:57.113
Uh... Cristina?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.072
No.

19:58.781 --> 19:59.615
Nadia!

20:00.199 --> 20:01.701
Unbelievable.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.620
Aless...

20:04.704 --> 20:07.998
Al... Al-ess... Alice?

20:09.417 --> 20:10.543
Alessandra?

20:11.585 --> 20:12.545
Uh...

20:12.962 --> 20:14.171
From Segovia?

20:15.297 --> 20:18.843
Ah, Alessandra! From Segovia! Of course!

20:19.301 --> 20:22.179
Boy, did we have some fun times
back in the good old days.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.308
You don't remember me.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.185
I... do not!

20:28.686 --> 20:32.148
How could you?
After what you put me through?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.066
Um...

20:34.150 --> 20:37.194
Please remind me what I did?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.529
You broke my heart!

20:42.199 --> 20:43.868
We met and danced.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.537
We had the most wonderful evening.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.206
We talked long into the night.

20:49.290 --> 20:53.085
We were having a romantic dinner,
but then, you just took off.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.546
And I never heard from you again!

20:56.088 --> 21:01.761
I made it my mission to make you feel
how I felt: hurt, lost, and alone.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.888
By trying to kill me?

21:03.971 --> 21:07.558
I was never going to kill you.
I just wanted to scare you.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.186
Well, I just...

21:11.061 --> 21:12.938
I... am sorry.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.524
I came back to the cantina to find you,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.276
but you were already gone.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.820
You went back to find me?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.573
Well, it was three days later, but...

21:22.656 --> 21:25.618
Ay, pobrecito!

21:25.701 --> 21:27.495
Whoa!

21:27.578 --> 21:29.497
Puss!

21:29.580 --> 21:34.084
To make up for it, I will make for you
a muy romantico y delicioso paella dinner.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.129
Ah, my favorite!
Let me just go freshen up.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.723
Oh, Alessandra! The paella is finished!

21:47.807 --> 21:49.391
I'll be right there!

21:49.558 --> 21:51.811
Huh?

21:52.937 --> 21:53.813
Meh.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.028
- Whoa!
- Puss! Puss, are you all right?

22:01.111 --> 22:03.823
- No. We must go back. I...
- Shh, shh, shh!

22:03.906 --> 22:06.450
It's over now, Puss. You're safe.
