WEBVTT

00:33.284 --> 00:37.288
That looks perfect!

00:37.288 --> 00:39.749
Aagh! I am so excited

00:39.749 --> 00:43.043
that Sir Pentious is staying at
the hotel.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.088
Um... Pentious was just trying
to take over the city with

00:46.088 --> 00:49.091
his weird steampunk
bullshit a few days ago.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.261
Well, I haven't seen him
try to pull any of that here.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.514
What the hell is that?

00:55.514 --> 00:58.434
Oh, hello, purple female.

00:58.768 --> 01:03.522
It's my new invention,
the "Skin Flayer 11,000".

01:04.190 --> 01:08.277
I'm really looking forward
to shooting the other residents.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.445
What? Why?

01:09.445 --> 01:11.447
Everyone is being too nice.

01:11.447 --> 01:13.449
Obviously, it must be a lie.

01:13.449 --> 01:17.119
I can sense they are
planning to kill me, but when?

01:17.119 --> 01:19.622
How?
I must be prepared!

01:19.622 --> 01:22.166
Ooh, the new parts
of my machine are here.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.794
Sign, please.

01:24.794 --> 01:28.464
Thank you for your business.
Enjoy your Carmine purchase.

01:28.464 --> 01:31.467
Carmine? As in Carmella Carmine.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.552
You are buying
parts from an overlord?

01:33.552 --> 01:36.847
Err, of course. She's the top
weapons dealer in Hell.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.308
Okay, well,
that stops right now.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.644
- Hey.
- You absolutely cannot

01:41.644 --> 01:43.145
build weapons in this hotel.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.147
No one is trying to kill you.

01:45.147 --> 01:48.317
People are being nice because
they want you to feel welcome.

01:57.368 --> 02:00.496
- Hmm. I have my doubts.
- Well, it's true.

02:00.496 --> 02:03.165
- You have to trust us.
- But I don't.

02:03.165 --> 02:07.670
Well, why don't we focus
on that for today's activities?

02:07.878 --> 02:09.755
Not before
we lay some ground rules.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.590
No more building weapons,

02:11.590 --> 02:13.592
no more plotting
against other guests.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.761
And you need to
get rid of these things.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.349
Ugh! What did I just say?
What did I just say?

02:20.349 --> 02:24.520
What? Not my little egg boys.
They do my evil bidding for me.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.189
Do you want to stay
here and redeem yourself?

02:27.189 --> 02:30.192
- Yes.
- Then no more eggs.

02:30.192 --> 02:33.237
All right,
eggies. You've got to go.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.573
I...

02:35.573 --> 02:38.534
- Can't keep you anymore.
- Okay, boss.

02:38.534 --> 02:42.413
No, don't resist.
This is how it has to be.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.802
Alastor!

02:59.263 --> 03:01.599
Do you mind? I'm in
the middle of breakfast.

03:01.599 --> 03:04.226
Pentious's eggs
are all over the place,

03:04.226 --> 03:05.728
and I need
you to get rid of them.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.855
Oh, well, in that case,
I'd be delighted to!

03:07.855 --> 03:09.440
Humanely!

03:09.648 --> 03:11.650
Hm.
Well, that's a lot less hot,

03:11.650 --> 03:14.403
but I suppose I can take care of
that on my outing today.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.739
Great.
That looks disgusting.

03:16.739 --> 03:19.325
Hi, guys. Thanks for coming.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.285
It's been
brought to our attention

03:21.285 --> 03:23.329
that there may be a little...

03:24.830 --> 03:26.540
tension in the hotel.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.375
Tension that
can be counterproductive

03:28.375 --> 03:30.336
to what we're trying to do here.

03:30.336 --> 03:36.008
We think that this group could
really benefit from...

03:36.008 --> 03:38.469
- Trust exercises!
- Trust exercises!

03:38.469 --> 03:39.595
Ah shit!

03:40.262 --> 03:42.556
Vaggie, we rehearsed this.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.643
We're doing trust exercises.

03:45.643 --> 03:49.605
So, what's
with the whole, uhhh..This?

03:49.897 --> 03:53.359
I'm not about to put on some
show for these fucking chumps.

03:53.359 --> 03:56.654
Oh, I will,
but it's cash up front,

03:56.654 --> 03:59.323
and I know that one,
can't afford me.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.826
Gross! I'd never
think of it spider!

04:02.826 --> 04:05.871
Right. Well,
let's get started. Charlie?

04:05.871 --> 04:09.917
Actually, I thought maybe you
could take the lead on this one.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.586
I trust everyone,
so maybe you know better

04:12.586 --> 04:14.672
about how to build it properly.

04:14.672 --> 04:18.968
What? Uhh, I don't know if I'm
qualified, uh--

04:18.968 --> 04:22.471
Oh, come on. It'll be easy.
I'm sure you can handle this.

04:22.471 --> 04:26.934
Yeah, Um... Sure,
I can handle this. No problem.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.812
All right,

04:29.812 --> 04:31.689
so we are
starting with trust falls.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.565
Each of you are going
to share something vulnerable

04:33.565 --> 04:35.901
with the group about yourself
and then fall backwards,

04:35.901 --> 04:37.653
while the rest of
the group catches you.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.613
Got it?
Who wants to go first?

04:39.613 --> 04:42.783
Oooohh, ooohh, me me me! Me!
Me! Me!

04:42.783 --> 04:44.702
All right.
Get on up here.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.830
I love you guys.

04:47.830 --> 04:51.834
Like really, really love you.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.336
Whoa!
Gotcha.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.756
That felt good!

04:57.756 --> 05:00.884
- Angel, why don't you go next?
- Fine.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.054
This time
everyone needs to catch him.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.640
Okay?
Unless you want me to hurt you.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.019
Somethin' about myself, huh?
How about this?

05:10.019 --> 05:12.396
I love to suck--

05:12.396 --> 05:13.981
I swear to
fuck if you say dicks.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.025
Popsicles, ya sicko!

05:16.025 --> 05:20.362
Get your mind out of the gutter.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.573
But you know, dick's too!

05:24.408 --> 05:27.286
All right, new guy, you're up.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.414
I...

05:30.414 --> 05:32.833
don't want to
live without my minions.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.544
Nobody catch me.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.837
- Damn it.
- That's great.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.422
Wow, you are slimy.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.424
Okay. Good job.
Err, Niffty.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.596
Sometimes I kill motherbugs
in front of their children

05:45.596 --> 05:47.431
as a warning to others.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.643
Yay! Pain.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.940
Pain!

05:58.108 --> 06:00.652
I don't know if this is
really working the way we hoped.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.154
Maybe we should--

06:02.154 --> 06:04.031
Honey,
you have to trust me here.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.742
I got this, okay?
I'll figure something out.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.744
If you're in
the market for some ideas,

06:08.744 --> 06:12.664
I got just a thing
for some "trust" buildin'.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.792
What do you have in mind?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.545
Oh, boy. What's the plan, boss?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.922
I like your suit.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.632
What are the antlers for?

06:21.632 --> 06:23.884
Can I touch your staff thing?

06:23.884 --> 06:26.845
Are those
your ears? Or is it your hair? I can't tell.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.931
Hark, Alastor.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.433
How fare thee this day?

06:31.433 --> 06:32.643
Who's that, boss?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.478
Want me to rough him up for you?

06:34.478 --> 06:37.606
Follow in silence
if you value your shell.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.858
Greetings Zestial!

06:39.858 --> 06:41.485
Oh holy shit!

06:41.735 --> 06:44.696
Ah, the weather doth
become this fine day.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.910
Indeed. Looks like we might have
some acid rain this afternoon.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.913
If our luck doth hold!

06:52.913 --> 06:56.792
I do revel in the screams.
How art thou?

06:56.792 --> 06:59.044
It has been an age since thou
hath graced us with thy presence.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.963
Oh, fuck!

07:00.963 --> 07:05.467
Some hath spun wild
tales of you falling to...

07:05.467 --> 07:07.136
<i>holy arms</i> .

07:09.096 --> 07:12.641
Oh, I just took a well earned
sabbatical. Nothing serious.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.227
Though it's fun to
keep everyone on their toes.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.982
There too hath been
rumour of thy involvement

07:19.982 --> 07:23.819
with the princess and
her recent flight of fancy.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.947
Tell me, how does
thou fall in such folly?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.615
That is for me to know.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.200
But please do guess.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.161
I'd love to know the theories.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.622
T'would
be grander folly by far

07:35.622 --> 07:38.584
to assume the workings
of <i>your</i> mind, Alastor.

07:38.584 --> 07:42.921
Thou hath been naught but
an enigma since thy manifested in this realm.

07:42.921 --> 07:47.926
Coming from someone as ancient as
you, I take that as quite the compliment.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.981
No, No. I have a very
important task for you.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.692
Stay here and guard
the front until I return.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.449
Oh look.
Frank is up there.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.743
We have names?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.083
Oh!

08:36.016 --> 08:36.975
Oh!

08:40.771 --> 08:42.856
Welcome,
Hell sovereign overlords.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.733
I've invited you all here

08:44.733 --> 08:47.694
because you represent the
controlling powers of our city.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.696
Together,
you own millions of souls.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.824
Souls at risk with the new
extermination schedule.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.619
We need to discuss what can be
done to minimize

08:55.619 --> 08:58.914
the impact to our interest.

08:58.914 --> 09:02.834
- Zestial, so good to see you, my friend.
- Enchanted as always Carmilla.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.253
Alastor?

09:04.253 --> 09:07.256
Yes, I know I've
been absent some time.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.925
I'm sure you've
all been wondering.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.886
Not really.
But welcome back in any case.

09:13.595 --> 09:19.601
This year's extermination was
<i>brutal</i> , far more even than years past.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.855
We have assessed that about
16% of the population was lost.

09:23.855 --> 09:26.942
With the angelic legions now
returning twice as quickly

09:26.942 --> 09:28.652
I think it prudent we--

09:28.652 --> 09:31.071
Yes, I've got it handled, Vox.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.614
Are you doubting me?

09:32.614 --> 09:35.617
Really? Me?
That's what I thought.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.079
Yes, I know. They're all a joke.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.373
Thank you, Vee.
See you soon.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.874
Kisses, darling.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.626
Nice of you to join us,
Velvette.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.213
Will your... colleagues be
joining?

09:48.213 --> 09:51.133
No. They have better shit to do
than to listen to an old windbag

09:51.133 --> 09:54.136
Who thinks she's tough shit.
I'm here to represent.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.971
Charming.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.308
So, as I was
saying, we need to discuss-

10:00.767 --> 10:04.813
- Yes?
- On the subject of discussion...

10:04.813 --> 10:06.356
Ooh shit.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.859
Oh, tasty!

10:08.859 --> 10:10.652
Where did you get this?

10:10.652 --> 10:13.280
We found it during
extermination day.

10:13.280 --> 10:18.160
If these Holy Rollers can
be killed, the game has changed.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.163
We can take the fight to them.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.666
The boys and I have come
up with a full assault plan.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.093
If it be true thee and
thy colleagues desire to war,

10:35.093 --> 10:36.762
with such meagre proof.

10:36.762 --> 10:41.183
Thou art far more
foolish than I be thought.

10:41.183 --> 10:44.353
Meager proof? It's a
dead fucking exorcist.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.813
I'd say that's
pretty fucking definitive.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.149
You going blind, old man?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
We know not how this perished.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.029
mayhaps t'was not by a demon's
hand at all.

10:54.029 --> 10:57.115
If we rush to war without
knowing mightn't they purge

10:57.115 --> 11:00.118
<i>all</i> of Hell for
daring an uprising?

11:03.038 --> 11:05.123
Oh,
that's possible I suppose.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.793
Oh, I get it.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.712
So Grandpa is
too pussy to fight,

11:10.712 --> 11:12.381
so I guess
there's no point, right?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.343
Oh. What's the matter, Fossil?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.054

Safe travels back to
the nursing home, fuckers.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.323
Kiss my ass.

13:03.492 --> 13:07.287
What the hell?
We literally just got here.

13:08.914 --> 13:09.998
Mother?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.254
Hmm!

13:16.254 --> 13:18.006
Well, that's interesting.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.344
You little egg creature.
I have a job for you.

13:22.344 --> 13:26.056
- Oh, yes, boss.
- Follow them.

13:29.351 --> 13:33.355
Angel! What the actual fuck?

13:34.022 --> 13:38.360
No activity requires
more trust than BDSM, baby.

13:38.360 --> 13:43.365
No bond stronger than
those formed through bondage.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.242
That's their motto.

13:47.077 --> 13:52.624
Angel, love the enthusiasm.
But umm, uh... Hmmmm...

13:52.624 --> 13:56.044
What makes you think
anyone would be into this?

13:56.044 --> 13:59.506
Ya know, I... I don't hate this.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.219
I'm ready
to punish some bad boys.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.222
Never mind, I-I'm out.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.560
Okay, hello,
there. Hi. Um. Hm...

14:13.562 --> 14:16.565
Ugh, I can't fucking believe
I let you drag us here Angel.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.066
This is disgusting.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.609
It's no big deal, Vaggie.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.404
You know,
maybe I can just help, uh--

14:22.404 --> 14:24.239
No. I told you,
you could trust me.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.949
And I'm not
going to let you down.

14:27.492 --> 14:31.037
I just need to teach them the
way I was taught.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.914
AHHH!

14:32.914 --> 14:34.416
This is
how you learned to trust people?

14:34.416 --> 14:37.419
Bring it on Bitch, Yeehaw!

14:37.419 --> 14:39.087
There is nothing stronger

14:39.087 --> 14:41.256
than the trust
between comrades and arms.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.467
Buckle up, butter cups, because
today you boys become men!

14:44.467 --> 14:46.428
You...

14:46.428 --> 14:49.931
Wait, wait! I
can't fight without my minions--

14:49.931 --> 14:52.559
...
Are going to <i>survive</i> together.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
Aaaahhh!
And you--

14:54.227 --> 14:55.604
D-don't you even think
about it--

14:55.604 --> 14:56.688
Are going to
make this hotel work!

14:59.065 --> 15:02.360
My turn, my turn!

15:02.360 --> 15:04.112
Vaggie! No!

15:04.112 --> 15:05.530
This is the only way
they'll learn, Charlie.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.407
No, it's not.
There are other ways.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.327
- It just takes time.
- Time we don't have.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.370
How many
exterminations

15:12.370 --> 15:14.623
will have gone by before these
idiots get their shit together?

15:14.623 --> 15:16.958
How many times do we have
to watch your people be killed

15:16.958 --> 15:18.960
before we make headway?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.503
Vaggie...

15:20.503 --> 15:23.173
I took charge today
and it all went sideways.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.091
I'm supposed to make
your dreams a reality.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.635
I'm supposed to protect you.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.303
I'm supposed to never fail you.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.305
I blame you for this you
crazy bitch!

15:30.639 --> 15:32.557
You didn't fail me,

15:32.557 --> 15:35.435
Vaggie... You're not--

15:35.435 --> 15:38.021
If I can't help you,
what's the point of me?

15:38.271 --> 15:42.359
Vaggie, don't say that!
You do so much! It's--

15:42.359 --> 15:45.695
I'm sorry. I'd like
to be alone for a minute.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.913
Made it.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.332
Let's go home, guys.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.377
Ugh! I just walked
up all those stairs.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.932
Carmilla,
what troubles thou?

16:14.391 --> 16:17.185
Losing thy
composure is unlike thee.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.437
It's nothing, Zestial.
Really.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.690
The felled angel...

16:22.107 --> 16:23.775
'twas by thy hand, was it not?

16:23.775 --> 16:26.152
- Let's not talk about it.
- Mom...

16:26.152 --> 16:27.487
Maybe he should know.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.364
<i>Nobody</i> should know.

16:29.364 --> 16:34.160

19:41.806 --> 19:44.183
So, what did you hear?

19:44.976 --> 19:48.730
First the old guy w-was
all "you're not yourself,

19:48.730 --> 19:51.316
you're the one that
killed the angel" a-a-and

19:51.316 --> 19:52.734
then she was all

19:52.734 --> 19:54.611
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

19:54.611 --> 19:57.655
- And then what was that last thing?
- She killed the angel?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.574
Interesting.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.577
Let's keep this between us,
<i>shall we?</i>

20:02.577 --> 20:03.786
You got it, boss.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.374
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.669
I'm sorry I got so crazy today.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.422
No, no, I'm sorry.

20:14.797 --> 20:18.426
I'm sorry I put pressure on you.
We work as a team.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.804
I guess I just thought
all this would be easier,

20:21.804 --> 20:25.642
But we'll figure
it out... together.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.896
I mean, look what
your exercise did for them.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.318
And then when that buff
guy started beating the shit outta you.

20:35.318 --> 20:38.321
Ha ha!
Yes, with the dismembered arm.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.908
Yes, that was
particularly unpleasant.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.785
I liked that part.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.578
Well hey,

20:45.578 --> 20:47.580
at least you can take
a beating like a champ.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.457
You did okay, new kid.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.876
Really?
Oh, well,

20:51.876 --> 20:55.838
I suppose I did get into a little
of the old rough and tumble today.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.969
And thank you for
pulling me out of there.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.728
Well, how about that?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.690
Alastor...

21:13.690 --> 21:15.650
Failed to get rid
of the eggs, I see.

21:15.650 --> 21:20.905
Yes, well, the little monsters
prove to be rather useful.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.449
Why don't you give
them back to Pentious?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.535
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.870
After today, I guess I
can trust you with them.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.790
But seriously, no more weapons.

21:30.999 --> 21:35.795
Ahhhh! My eggs! Yeah.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.006
Oh it's so good
to have you back.

21:38.006 --> 21:42.010
Now go clean
my quarters this instant!

21:42.010 --> 21:45.346
Maybe things will
move faster than you think.

21:45.888 --> 21:49.726
Ah! How was your
day with Alastor my minions?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.561
It was awesome, boss.

21:51.561 --> 21:54.814
I went to this meeting
and there was a knife lady,

21:54.814 --> 21:58.359
an old guy and a dinosaur.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.694
That's nice.

21:59.694 --> 22:02.030
And the nice
lady killed an angel.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.658
And I was not
supposed to talk about it--

22:05.658 --> 22:09.662
Oh, I'm so sure and maybe
you'll meet martians tomorrow.

22:09.662 --> 22:15.001
But now it's time for sleep.
Good night Eggies.
