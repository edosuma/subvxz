00:41.542 --> 00:43.043
Hey.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.422
How about letting an
old timer sit in tonight?

00:49.801 --> 00:51.803
It's cool, I'm Tucker's brother.

00:51.803 --> 00:55.765
I used to run these meetings.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.937
Looks like you've
changed things a little bit.

01:00.937 --> 01:05.024
When I was here we'd...

01:05.608 --> 01:06.609
Gary!

01:06.609 --> 01:07.652
Gramps?

01:07.652 --> 01:08.987
I need your help!

01:08.987 --> 01:13.073
[telephone ringing]

01:13.992 --> 01:15.743
Hello?

01:15.743 --> 01:16.943
Hi Gramma.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.206
No, it's okay I was a...

01:21.206 --> 01:22.834
I was awake sort of uh...

01:22.834 --> 01:25.711
What's up?

01:28.631 --> 01:29.351
Oh no.

01:52.030 --> 01:52.780
Hi.

01:56.575 --> 02:00.162
We were sitting
here just yesterday...

02:00.162 --> 02:05.710
watching kids play
ball on the street.

02:05.710 --> 02:09.253
Gene got such a
kick out of that.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.636
It's amazing how
quickly things can change.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.347
But Gramps wasn't even sick.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.682
What happened?

02:19.682 --> 02:23.143
He came home upset
about something.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.063
I've never seen
him in such a state.

02:25.063 --> 02:29.901
He... he was
angry and frightened.

02:29.901 --> 02:37.033
I tried to calm him down
but, he was all wound up...

02:37.033 --> 02:41.704
and his heart wasn't
strong enough to take it.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.455
What was he so upset about?

02:43.455 --> 02:47.085
I don't know!

02:47.085 --> 02:49.837
But he said...

02:49.837 --> 02:54.133
it had something to do with you!

03:01.099 --> 03:06.478
He was desperate to
tell you something.

03:06.478 --> 03:10.149
Your Grandfather Gene
was a wonderful man.

03:10.149 --> 03:15.696
He loved to tell stories
and laugh at silly things.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.366
He wasn't often
serious, but when he was,

03:19.366 --> 03:22.536
I always listened.

03:22.536 --> 03:29.835
And he was very serious about
making sure that you got this.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.886
It's a piece of an old record.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.055
"Listen to the music".

03:41.055 --> 03:44.850
He wrote this to
go along with it.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.105
Grandma?

03:49.105 --> 03:51.107
I came as soon as I heard.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.483
Ah Tucker.

03:52.483 --> 03:55.527
I'm glad you did.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.865
I don't know what to say.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.119
It's alright, I
know how you feel.

04:03.119 --> 04:06.288
It's my dream.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.873
What dream?

04:07.873 --> 04:10.292
Grandma I need some
time to figure this out.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.128
I'll be back later alright.

04:12.128 --> 04:14.755
C'mon Tuck.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.298
Do you need anything?

04:16.298 --> 04:18.009
No.
No thank you.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.593
Call me later huh?.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.180
You got it.

04:24.723 --> 04:25.975
What's with the note?

04:25.975 --> 04:27.267
You have a
meeting tonight?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.393
Yeah but
I'll cancel...

04:28.393 --> 04:29.436
Don't.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.395
Why not?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.438
Because I'll be there.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.898
Why?

04:32.898 --> 04:34.608
To deal with this.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.196
It might tell us why
Grandpa Gene died.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.368
So, your grandfather
started the Midnight Society.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.703
1937.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.412
He and four friends
cleared these woods,

04:47.412 --> 04:51.917
made the fire ring, and
built the storyteller's chair.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.837
There's been a Midnight Society
coming out here ever since.

04:54.837 --> 04:58.674
Wow that's a lot of stories.

04:58.674 --> 05:03.012
I'll bet your gramps
told great stories.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.514
Just before he died
Gramps wrote down a story.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.808
Go ahead!

05:07.808 --> 05:08.976
His last.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.477
And it's the most amazing story

05:10.477 --> 05:13.814
The Midnight Society's
ever going to hear.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.319
He began it over 60 years ago,
and it's still not finished.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.738
Not finished??

05:20.738 --> 05:22.364
He wants US to finish it.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.575
It's about five best
friends who got this

05:24.575 --> 05:25.784
charm from a magic shop.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.578
Like the Magic Mansion?

05:27.578 --> 05:28.996
Yeah, sorta.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.915
They thought it was
a good luck piece.

05:30.915 --> 05:33.876
But they soon found out the
only luck this charm had...

05:33.876 --> 05:36.712
was BAD luck.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.923
Good start, keep goin'.

05:38.923 --> 05:41.383
The charm was called "The
Silver Sight" and it held

05:41.383 --> 05:42.843
a powerful, black magic.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.179
When they found out, they
tried to get rid of it,

05:45.179 --> 05:47.598
but they didn't know how.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.726
And then horrible
things started to go down...

05:50.726 --> 05:53.812
all because one of the friends,
someone they thought they could

05:53.812 --> 05:59.235
trust, was using the
evil magic of the charm.

05:59.235 --> 06:01.612
A traitor in the
group, excellent!

06:01.612 --> 06:04.364
So one of the friends
took the charm and hid it.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.117
He gave each of the
others one clue

06:06.117 --> 06:07.743
to where it was hidden.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.828
They'd have to put their
clues together to find it,

06:09.828 --> 06:12.831
and working together was the
only way they could destroy it.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.208
Cool!

06:14.208 --> 06:16.127
Like a treasure hunt!

06:16.127 --> 06:18.045
What were the clues?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.005
The guy made a voice recording.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.174
They didn't have
cassettes or CD's back then,

06:22.174 --> 06:24.676
so he made a record.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.220
He broke it into five pieces.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.097
On each piece he
wrote down one clue,

06:28.097 --> 06:31.016
gave a piece to each of his
friends, and kept one himself.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.311
So to find out where
The Silver Sight was,

06:33.311 --> 06:35.104
they had to put the
record together,

06:35.104 --> 06:37.106
get all the clues,
and listen to it.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.190
Exactly.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.733
That's cool.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.443
Then what happens?

06:41.443 --> 06:44.363
What happens is this
isn't a story, is it?

06:44.363 --> 06:45.613
What?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.119
Yeah this is a story...

06:50.119 --> 06:51.453
a TRUE story.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.704
No way!

06:52.704 --> 06:54.290
Gary, this really happened?

06:54.290 --> 06:57.751
Well...
unfortunately, yeah.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.045
Why don't you
tell us everything.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.256
Alright, here it is.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.091
The five friends were the
first Midnight Society.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.760
They never got back together
so, the Silver Sight's been

07:06.760 --> 07:08.762
hidden all these years.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.098
Good, let it STAY hidden.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.393
But yesterday, something
scared Grandpa Gene so bad,

07:14.393 --> 07:18.356
he had a heart attack, it had to
do with this Silver Sight thing.

07:18.356 --> 07:20.858
You mean, like it's come back??

07:20.858 --> 07:22.442
I don't know.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.029
This note is a plea for help.
He gave it to me because

07:25.029 --> 07:27.114
he didn't think anyone
else would believe him.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.241
What kind of help?

07:29.241 --> 07:31.743
Gramps wants me to track
down the Old Midnight Society,

07:31.743 --> 07:34.372
get their clues, find The
Silver Sight and destroy it

07:34.372 --> 07:35.706
once and for all...

07:35.706 --> 07:37.375
like they should
done have years ago.

07:37.375 --> 07:38.625
Whoa.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.378
So how come you're telling us?

07:40.378 --> 07:42.254
Because we gotta move fast.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.923
Gramps was afraid somebody
else might find it first.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.551
And there's nobody we could
go to who'd believe us...

07:47.551 --> 07:48.844
except you guys.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.888
So, what do you want us to do?

07:50.888 --> 07:52.223
I've got four names...

07:52.223 --> 07:54.141
the rest of the Old
Midnight Society.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.435
We'd split up, find 'em, get
their pieces of the record.

07:56.435 --> 07:57.686
That's it.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.563
Tuck and I will
take it from there.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.772
What if we find the traitor?

08:00.772 --> 08:02.566
I don't know.

08:02.566 --> 08:06.862
Look, I won't blame you guys
if you don't want to help.

08:12.243 --> 08:14.370
Gary, we tell stories here!

08:14.370 --> 08:15.579
Made up stories!

08:15.579 --> 08:16.830
This is like...

08:16.830 --> 08:18.123
REAL!

08:18.123 --> 08:19.458
Exactly!

08:19.458 --> 08:20.918
That's why we have
to do something...

08:20.918 --> 08:22.836
because it's real!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.713
Tell us about the
Silver Sight thing again?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.882
It's a charm,
probably a small thing,

08:26.882 --> 08:29.885
but has got some kind of power
that can really hurt people.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.720
Oh man I'm not liking this.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.472
Your gramps was a
good guy, right?

08:33.472 --> 08:35.057
The best.

08:35.057 --> 08:40.604
I gotta find out why he died.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.523
Okay, give me a name.
Quick, before I change my mind.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.235
Alright.
Thanks Meg.

08:46.235 --> 08:47.861
Why don't we just find

08:47.861 --> 08:49.447
the guy that hid the thing?

08:49.447 --> 08:52.074
He died the day after he hid it.

08:52.074 --> 08:55.453
Oh man, this just
keeps getting better.

08:55.453 --> 08:57.329
I'll help.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.872
Me too...

08:58.872 --> 09:01.166
but, not by myself.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.877
No problem, how 'bout the
two of you work together.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.337
Alright?

09:05.337 --> 09:08.048
Don't you think this is
a little out of bounds.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.300
It's alright Quinn.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.304
You don't have to help man.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.224
You know I'll help.

09:17.224 --> 09:21.312
Cuz if this thing gets
nasty, you're gonna need me.

09:21.312 --> 09:23.939
Great man.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.900
Alright Tuck and I'll take
care of the fourth name.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.611
Now remember, it's the pieces
of the record that we need.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.530
That's where the clues are.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.949
We'll meet tomorrow in my dorm
room for a status report. Okay?

09:33.949 --> 09:36.160
Alright!
Let's hit it!

09:36.160 --> 09:38.245
Guys...

09:38.245 --> 09:40.205
I uh...

09:40.205 --> 09:43.667
well, thanks for doing this.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.344
You forgot something.

09:53.344 --> 09:54.845
What?

09:54.845 --> 09:57.097
Story needs a title.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.347
Yeah.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.813
I haven't done this in a while.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.525
Submitted for the approval
of The Midnight Society,

10:07.525 --> 10:11.195
I call this story...

10:12.863 --> 10:14.948
Whoa!

10:17.826 --> 10:22.373
That's kinda not normal.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.262
Ha ha ha.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.265
Ha ha ha!

10:59.784 --> 11:00.504
Hello!

11:02.662 --> 11:05.207
Hello in there!

11:05.207 --> 11:06.333
Don't be a goof.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.336
What??
We're on TV!

11:19.888 --> 11:21.098
Be cool.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.600
This guy's a war hero.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.393
This guy's a RICH war hero!

11:24.393 --> 11:25.603
What's his name?

11:25.603 --> 11:27.104
Laing Candle.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.981
The oldest member of the
original Midnight Society.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.701
Hey check this out.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.621
What?

11:43.621 --> 11:44.341
What?!

11:54.714 --> 11:58.302
Step in men, don't be shy!

12:00.137 --> 12:04.391
Yes I can see your
grandfather in both of you...

12:04.391 --> 12:08.270
except for the slouch of course.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.607
I was very sorry to hear
about his untimely demise.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.485
Never thought he'd go before me.

12:14.485 --> 12:15.735
Pity.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.113
Mr. Candle we...

12:18.113 --> 12:19.114
General.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.115
Excuse me?

12:20.115 --> 12:22.117
You call me General.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.535
Okay...

12:23.535 --> 12:24.911
GENERAL...

12:24.911 --> 12:27.498
you were part of The
Midnight Society, right?

12:27.498 --> 12:29.124
Midnight Society.

12:29.124 --> 12:33.878
Haven't thought about that
team for quite some time.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.173
This way!

12:42.429 --> 12:44.473
That was an exceptional group.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.351
Every last one of them.

12:47.351 --> 12:52.063
That's how I like
to remember them.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.691
Take it I have another.

12:53.691 --> 12:54.733
Aw, cool!

12:54.733 --> 12:57.819
You're slouching again.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.572
Uh, we're here because uh...

13:00.572 --> 13:01.990
Speak up son!

13:01.990 --> 13:04.868
If you got anything
worth saying, say it!

13:04.868 --> 13:06.286
Well.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.956
We're here about
The Silver Sight.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.419
Why in the name of Sam Houston
are you asking about that?

13:14.419 --> 13:16.505
It was Gramps' last request.

13:16.505 --> 13:19.257
He wants us to find
it and destroy it.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.676
You know what it is, right?

13:20.676 --> 13:24.555
Question is, do
you know what it is?

13:24.555 --> 13:26.640
Sort of.
It's like this...

13:26.640 --> 13:28.016
little evil charm thing.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.686
It's the devil's own tool.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.896
Go home and forget
you ever heard of it.

13:32.896 --> 13:33.855
We can't.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.106
Grandpa Gene wrote...

13:35.106 --> 13:36.734
Have you got his
piece of the record?

13:36.734 --> 13:38.068
Well, we're...

13:38.068 --> 13:40.111
We're tracking
down ALL the pieces.

13:40.111 --> 13:43.490
We'd like to have
your piece, if we could.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.711
I always thought something
like this would happen.

13:55.711 --> 13:58.797
A part of me wanted to
pass on before I had to

13:58.797 --> 14:03.594
face this particular
demon again.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.598
I'll have to dig
it out of storage.

14:07.598 --> 14:12.352
Come back in a few hours
I'll have it for you then.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.094
Thank you.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.067
I hope you know what
you've gotten yourself into.

14:19.067 --> 14:22.362
No one who has touched
the Silver Sight

14:22.362 --> 14:25.073
has emerged undamaged.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.043
Generally speaking, I think
the general is a little wacked.

14:37.043 --> 14:41.005
Doesn't matter, as long as we
get his piece of the record.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.245
Gary?

15:15.915 --> 15:16.755
Tucker?

15:37.855 --> 15:39.523
Who are you?

15:39.523 --> 15:41.733
What are you doing in my house?

15:41.733 --> 15:44.444
My grandson will be
back here any second!

15:44.444 --> 15:46.112
Ahhhh!

15:53.704 --> 15:54.954
Ahhh!

16:00.043 --> 16:00.943
P.U., what smells?

16:05.382 --> 16:07.718
Alright, alright, I'm guilty.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.636
You said this was
gonna be a dangerous

16:09.636 --> 16:11.388
mission not a dirty one.

16:11.388 --> 16:15.809
Well at least you're getting
closer to a piece of the record.

16:17.018 --> 16:21.022
Oh, you stink.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.232
Sorry.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.358
Hey check this out.

16:23.358 --> 16:26.778
Midnight Society 1937.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.238
Wow!

16:34.828 --> 16:36.120
So how'd you guys do?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.748
Not good.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.750
We've been to the
library, we've been on-line,

16:39.750 --> 16:43.086
we've called everywhere, but we
can't seem to find any record of

16:43.086 --> 16:44.379
Bruce McGorrill.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.047
There's gotta be
some trace somewhere.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.841
Keep looking alright.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.634
[telephone rings]

16:49.634 --> 16:50.635
Hello?

16:50.635 --> 16:51.929
Gary!

16:51.929 --> 16:53.805
Grandma?

16:53.805 --> 16:56.808
There's someone's in the house!

16:56.808 --> 16:58.727
I'm afraid he's...

16:58.727 --> 16:59.686
HELLO???

16:59.686 --> 17:00.687
HELLO??

17:00.687 --> 17:02.564
Hello??

17:03.398 --> 17:04.523
Grandma?

17:04.523 --> 17:07.109
What? Hello!! Grandma!

17:07.109 --> 17:08.236
What!

17:08.236 --> 17:08.955
C'mon!

17:17.203 --> 17:19.414
Grandma?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.708
Where are you?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.877
It's Gary and Tucker!
Where are you?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.628
Boys?

17:25.628 --> 17:28.590
Upstairs.
Go!

17:28.590 --> 17:30.467
Grandma?

17:30.467 --> 17:31.426
Are you alright?

17:31.426 --> 17:32.510
Yes, I'm fine.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.012
Someone broke into the house.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.431
I locked myself
in the bedroom...

17:36.431 --> 17:38.308
he destroyed my home.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.851
Did you see him?

17:39.851 --> 17:42.353
Yes, but I was frightened,
and he was wearing a mask.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.354
What did he want?

17:43.354 --> 17:44.564
It was horrible. He kept

17:44.564 --> 17:46.483
pounding at the door,
I thought he was

17:46.483 --> 17:48.652
going to break it down
and he kept yelling

17:48.652 --> 17:50.737
that he wanted Gene's
piece of the record.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.864
Oh my...

17:52.864 --> 17:53.865
Oh.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.325
Uh oh.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.035
This just got more serious.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.037
I'll call the police and
stay with Grandma.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.581
Tuck, go back and get
that thing we were after?

18:01.581 --> 18:02.457
Yeah, yeah sure.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.501
Good.
Go.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.418
Hey, you sure...?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.713
Yes.
Go now.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.217
Hey grandma.

18:13.217 --> 18:17.305
What is so important about
a broken piece of record?

18:19.432 --> 18:23.186
I think you should read this.

18:23.186 --> 18:28.107
It's Grandpa Gene's last story.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.363
Hey, it's me...

18:33.363 --> 18:34.698
I mean...

18:34.698 --> 18:38.326
I've come for the
record, General.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.928
Let me try.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.640
You SURE you want to go in?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.725
Well, yeah.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.434
He's expecting me.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.854
Okay.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

19:05.854 --> 19:11.026
Don't bother.
It's locked.

19:11.026 --> 19:14.278
Hey...
who are you?

19:16.573 --> 19:17.293
Hello?

19:19.034 --> 19:21.160
General?

19:21.160 --> 19:21.880
Hello?

19:49.439 --> 19:52.650
This is getting creepy.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.029
Hey!

19:56.029 --> 19:57.238
Both:
What're you doing here?

19:57.238 --> 19:58.615
Both:
I came for...

19:58.615 --> 20:00.617
Both:
But you're supposed to...

20:00.617 --> 20:02.869
I'm looking for...

20:03.369 --> 20:04.619
That!

20:12.170 --> 20:13.671
This is her, right?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.506
Donna Tilton?

20:15.506 --> 20:16.758
Looks like her.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.093
Excellent.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.594
Hey, you can't just take that!

20:19.594 --> 20:21.638
Yeah I can, it doesn't
belong to him.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.474
I'll tell you about it later!

20:24.474 --> 20:27.102
I know why you're here.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.437
You shouldn't be playing
the way you're playing.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.730
What do you mean?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.065
Cuz you're not good enough.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.191
For what?

20:33.191 --> 20:36.153
To handle the power.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.322
Hey!

20:39.322 --> 20:41.032
But if you still want to try...

20:41.032 --> 20:44.786
what you're looking for
is right... in... here.

20:44.786 --> 20:48.331
What's in there?
The Silver Sight?

20:48.331 --> 20:51.542
See for yourself!

21:12.189 --> 21:14.232
The record!

21:20.197 --> 21:22.699
Boy:
Ha ha ha!

21:50.852 --> 21:53.563
Boy:
You better turn around!

22:59.670 --> 23:00.390
Uh oh!

23:23.194 --> 23:27.949
Not all the eyes are brown?

23:30.618 --> 23:33.204
I warned you!

23:33.204 --> 23:36.916
It only gets worse from here.
