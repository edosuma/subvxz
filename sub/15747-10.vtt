WEBVTT

00:02.537 --> 00:06.058
Humanity's survival was never certain.

00:06.088 --> 00:10.012
We came close to perishing
many times before.

00:10.098 --> 00:13.649
In the 1300s, the bubonic plague killed

00:13.684 --> 00:17.153
over 20% of the humans on the globe.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.522
It took 300 years to restore

00:19.574 --> 00:21.652
the world's population.

00:23.011 --> 00:25.511
Later, the Spanish
flu infected more than

00:25.546 --> 00:28.022
half the people on Earth

00:28.052 --> 00:29.966
and killed 75 million

00:30.051 --> 00:33.052
before we were able to recover.

00:33.487 --> 00:35.438
And then science rose,

00:35.523 --> 00:37.356
and humanity flourished.

00:37.814 --> 00:41.360
The population soared
to more than 7 billion.

00:43.731 --> 00:46.399
Our advancements brought
us all closer together.

00:48.544 --> 00:50.903
We lost our fear.

00:51.272 --> 00:54.407
We believed we no
longer had any predators.

00:54.798 --> 00:58.828
We believed in the primacy
of science and technology.

00:58.913 --> 01:02.048
Oh, it's beautiful, Mike. Really is.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.834
But 41 days was all it took...

01:04.919 --> 01:08.042
from the day an airplane
arrived carrying this plague

01:08.072 --> 01:10.180
to the moment when mankind stood

01:10.210 --> 01:12.980
on the precipice of destruction.

01:13.010 --> 01:16.762
Humanity teetered on
the edge of the abyss.

01:16.797 --> 01:19.979
All it needed was one small push,

01:20.009 --> 01:23.302
or a final, last-ditch rescue.

01:25.822 --> 01:28.347
- _
- Out of my way!

01:31.445 --> 01:33.161
All clear.

01:33.246 --> 01:35.225
Back here, left.

01:35.255 --> 01:37.350
What's that?

01:40.804 --> 01:43.839
I have broken with the
Master once and for all.

01:43.924 --> 01:46.725
You sent him a letter of resignation?

01:46.810 --> 01:48.699
In a manner of speaking.

01:48.729 --> 01:52.364
I ambushed Eichhorst and
riddled him with silver bullets.

01:52.992 --> 01:56.034
Is... Eichhorst dead?

01:56.120 --> 01:58.487
He crawled away wounded,
but it's only a matter

01:58.572 --> 02:01.679
of time. He is no longer
of any consequence.

02:01.709 --> 02:02.826
I'm out of here!

02:02.856 --> 02:05.800
I also discovered what
the mysterious cargo was

02:05.830 --> 02:07.863
on board the Aurora Cutlass.

02:07.948 --> 02:10.621
- A nuclear weapon.
- There is a second

02:10.651 --> 02:13.573
now safely in my possession.

02:13.603 --> 02:15.932
- What does he need a second for?
- I know it is

02:15.962 --> 02:18.957
essential to complete the
Master's plan and, as such,

02:19.043 --> 02:21.708
he will do whatever it
takes to get it back.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.213
Without Eichhorst,

02:24.298 --> 02:27.132
the Master has to retrieve it himself...

02:27.218 --> 02:30.018
You want to know who the Master is?

02:30.104 --> 02:32.354
Get your team together
as soon as possible

02:32.440 --> 02:34.807
and be ready to ambush
him at Stoneheart.

02:34.859 --> 02:37.389
He'll be coming for my throat.

02:37.419 --> 02:39.978
You're playing a very
dangerous game, Eldritch.

02:40.030 --> 02:41.814
No other choice, Abraham.

02:41.899 --> 02:44.650
One final spin of the wheel.

02:44.702 --> 02:47.152
Now, this is the end
game for both of us.

02:47.204 --> 02:48.867
One way or the other.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.617
_

03:58.988 --> 04:01.413
Get away from me!

04:17.228 --> 04:19.512
Master. Ah!

04:29.058 --> 04:32.259
Whoa! Who do we have here?

04:35.050 --> 04:36.847
Ugh!

04:36.933 --> 04:39.350
- Oh!
- What is that?

04:41.153 --> 04:43.070
Is that a mask?

04:45.136 --> 04:47.942
My God! It's trying to pass for human.

04:48.027 --> 04:50.416
I haven't ever seen
one like this before.

04:51.459 --> 04:55.046
I want the head for my collection.

04:58.087 --> 05:00.955
Oh, God! You killed him! We're human!

05:01.007 --> 05:02.256
Can't you...?

05:44.467 --> 05:46.250
Get out of here!

05:50.389 --> 05:52.473
Get me that flag.

05:52.508 --> 05:55.342
Quick, I'm timing you. Go!

06:12.194 --> 06:14.194
Hey there. Are you OK?

06:14.246 --> 06:16.864
You alone?

06:16.916 --> 06:19.867
Where are your parents?

06:19.919 --> 06:21.535
You shouldn't be out here by yourself.

06:27.781 --> 06:31.128
- Family?
- Just leave me alone.

06:31.213 --> 06:34.214
I have a son your age.
We're leaving the city.

06:34.266 --> 06:36.413
Everybody is.

06:36.443 --> 06:38.769
You can come with us.

06:38.804 --> 06:41.455
Stop!

06:41.524 --> 06:42.634
Oh, shit!

06:42.664 --> 06:45.509
No! Don't shoot her!

06:45.561 --> 06:47.811
Go!

07:36.562 --> 07:39.362
_

07:40.900 --> 07:44.068
I know this is sudden,
but we must move quickly.

07:44.153 --> 07:46.453
This might be our best opportunity ever.

07:48.541 --> 07:52.331
Ephraim, you're just in time. Come.

07:52.361 --> 07:55.245
- What do you want?
- I'm here to help.

07:55.331 --> 07:57.414
We don't need you, Doc.

07:57.466 --> 07:59.717
Enough! Only if we all work together,

07:59.752 --> 08:03.887
do we have any chance to stop
this, or we're all gonna die.

08:03.923 --> 08:06.390
If you don't want to
cooperate, then leave,

08:06.425 --> 08:08.726
go, now! Any of you!

08:22.812 --> 08:24.908
- What do you want me to do?
- Dutch will take

08:24.944 --> 08:28.278
the device you both
developed and set it up here,

08:28.364 --> 08:31.331
one floor below the penthouse,
in the security office.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.417
It's close enough to be
in range, and I can use

08:33.452 --> 08:36.120
the security cameras to
monitor the Master's arrival.

08:36.205 --> 08:38.422
Eph, you can accompany me
up to Palmer's penthouse.

08:38.457 --> 08:41.625
As soon as the Master
arrives, Dutch will activate

08:41.711 --> 08:44.344
the device, incapacitating him.

08:44.430 --> 08:46.263
Fet will bring in the box,

08:46.298 --> 08:48.298
and then you, me,

08:48.384 --> 08:49.967
Fet, and Mr. Quinlan

08:50.019 --> 08:51.852
will force him inside it

08:51.937 --> 08:55.022
where the silver will trap him forever.

08:55.107 --> 08:57.775
Then we'll transfer
the Master to a tugboat,

08:57.810 --> 08:59.643
sail out to the North Atlantic

09:00.358 --> 09:01.645
and sink him.

09:01.697 --> 09:05.315
Then it's open season on munchers.

09:05.401 --> 09:07.451
Great!

09:07.486 --> 09:09.369
Let's sink the son of a bitch.

09:29.758 --> 09:31.875
Coming in now.

09:36.765 --> 09:38.298
Main 1, main 2 on location.

09:43.055 --> 09:44.938
Mr. Duncan, put men on the doors.

09:45.024 --> 09:47.691
Setrakian and his people must be
admitted as soon as they arrive.

09:47.726 --> 09:49.559
Get down!

09:56.960 --> 09:59.202
Mister Duncan!

10:00.322 --> 10:02.739
Aaah!

10:05.044 --> 10:07.577
Aaaah!

10:10.382 --> 10:12.249
Aaargh!

10:16.305 --> 10:18.422
Aaaah!

10:35.524 --> 10:37.190
You!

10:39.745 --> 10:42.612
You stole something that is mine.

10:42.698 --> 10:44.364
That is ours.

10:47.119 --> 10:49.169
It may please you

10:49.254 --> 10:51.755
to know you chose a partner as wily

10:51.790 --> 10:53.757
and as cutthroat as you are.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.959
The bomb is in my safe.

10:56.011 --> 10:58.795
I alone know the combination.

10:58.881 --> 11:01.848
We must work together now.

11:01.934 --> 11:04.101
Perhaps it is

11:04.136 --> 11:07.437
in my best interest not to destroy you.

11:12.728 --> 11:14.778
I shall abide by the terms

11:14.813 --> 11:16.780
of our original agreement.

11:21.286 --> 11:24.488
No, wait. Wait. No.

11:36.552 --> 11:38.502
Eldritch Palmer,

11:38.587 --> 11:41.671
eternal life is now yours.

12:52.528 --> 12:54.645
What's going on here?

12:55.765 --> 12:58.388
I heard about the man in the car.

12:58.418 --> 13:00.752
- He was gonna shoot her.
- Zack!

13:00.837 --> 13:03.137
- It wasn't my fault!
- Zachary,

13:03.223 --> 13:05.556
you did the right thing.

13:06.395 --> 13:07.658
I did?

13:11.765 --> 13:13.731
You're not mad?

13:13.767 --> 13:17.068
Mad? Being turned

13:17.103 --> 13:19.354
is an act of great beauty, Zack.

13:22.692 --> 13:25.443
- It is?
- Of course.

13:28.948 --> 13:31.616
Why haven't I been turned?

13:33.937 --> 13:36.454
I want to turn you.

13:36.506 --> 13:40.341
I do very much,

13:40.427 --> 13:42.510
but the Master,

13:42.579 --> 13:44.846
in his wisdom, has other plans.

13:45.968 --> 13:47.181
And Dad?

13:47.267 --> 13:50.268
I'd love nothing more than
for your father to join us,

13:50.303 --> 13:53.638
but your father is
following his own path,

13:53.723 --> 13:56.891
as he always does.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.679
I'm very proud of you
for what you did today.

14:02.065 --> 14:03.898
Both of you.

14:03.983 --> 14:05.817
And so is the Master.

14:05.902 --> 14:07.785
Speaking of which...

14:07.821 --> 14:09.987
get your things together,

14:10.039 --> 14:11.956
we're leaving here.

14:11.991 --> 14:14.625
Where are we going now?

14:14.661 --> 14:17.462
The Master has revealed himself,

14:17.497 --> 14:20.298
and we are going to join him.

14:31.845 --> 14:34.262
You know, at first, I
wondered why the professor

14:34.347 --> 14:36.063
wanted you up in Palmer's penthouse

14:36.149 --> 14:38.182
with him, but now I think I got it.

14:38.234 --> 14:40.351
Keep the weakest link close.

14:40.403 --> 14:42.937
You gotta hit me, huh?
Either with your fist

14:43.022 --> 14:46.157
or with insults. Did nothing
Setrakian said land with you?

14:46.192 --> 14:48.943
Get away! Go!

14:49.028 --> 14:50.995
- Guess not.
- You know what?

14:51.030 --> 14:54.665
After this is done, we'll never
have to see each other again.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.004
- I guess we agree on one thing.
- Yeah.

15:02.592 --> 15:04.675
You gonna fight me too?

15:06.546 --> 15:08.713
You made it very clear
that it was over between us.

15:08.798 --> 15:11.048
Not as clear as you made it.

15:11.134 --> 15:13.551
You have a very high opinion

15:13.603 --> 15:15.520
of your own moral compass, don't you?

15:15.555 --> 15:17.855
God forbid somebody do
something you disagree with.

15:17.891 --> 15:20.308
You mean, like sleep with
every other person I meet?

15:20.393 --> 15:23.027
Sanctimonious, hypocritical prick!

16:06.523 --> 16:08.369
_

16:08.399 --> 16:11.831
_

16:12.543 --> 16:18.627
_

16:19.677 --> 16:27.363
_

16:29.053 --> 16:30.628
Why,

16:30.713 --> 16:34.799
mein Master, have you taken his form?

16:34.884 --> 16:37.602
For what purpose, my Lord?

16:37.637 --> 16:40.438
A necessary ruse.

16:40.473 --> 16:43.858
And I now possess all
of Palmer's knowledge

16:43.943 --> 16:45.918
and memories.

16:45.948 --> 16:50.565
Thus, using Palmer's memories,

16:50.650 --> 16:53.818
I have located the other nuclear device.

16:53.903 --> 16:57.121
- Where is it?
- Here.

16:57.156 --> 16:59.373
Your conquest

16:59.459 --> 17:01.325
is assured, my Lord.

17:02.996 --> 17:05.329
My time is at an end.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.383
Release me.

17:09.469 --> 17:12.169
My most loyal

17:12.255 --> 17:14.755
and faithful servant,

17:14.840 --> 17:17.508
I know my visage troubles you,

17:17.560 --> 17:20.895
but your talents are
more necessary than ever.

17:20.964 --> 17:23.513
You are far too valuable to me

17:23.566 --> 17:25.933
to lose you now.

17:53.292 --> 17:57.518
_

17:58.780 --> 18:03.554
_

18:04.092 --> 18:09.304
_

18:26.471 --> 18:29.558
His new host body is pure expedience.

18:30.436 --> 18:32.728
A brilliant master stroke in fact.

18:34.482 --> 18:37.299
No one can stop him now.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.231
Done.

18:40.261 --> 18:41.511
Perfect.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.124
Thank you.

18:50.665 --> 18:53.666
Zack, would you like
to see what is inside?

18:53.734 --> 18:57.386
- Sure.
- Come.

19:04.679 --> 19:06.190
Whoa.

19:06.220 --> 19:10.099
The detonator and the device
are synced. Once the device

19:10.151 --> 19:12.852
is armed...

19:12.937 --> 19:15.104
a red light comes on, here.

19:16.199 --> 19:18.073
Also on the detonator.

19:18.103 --> 19:20.186
You see?

19:22.673 --> 19:24.957
I'll leave the detonator with you.

19:25.009 --> 19:26.792
It is armed now.

19:29.597 --> 19:32.798
You will keep it for the Master.

19:32.850 --> 19:35.634
He, and he only, is to press the button.

19:35.686 --> 19:37.436
Is that clear?

19:37.471 --> 19:38.971
Yes.

19:42.059 --> 19:44.977
The Master has an important
meeting at Stoneheart

19:45.029 --> 19:47.730
Headquarters upstairs.
Once it is finished,

19:47.815 --> 19:49.648
the final phase will commence.

19:53.753 --> 19:55.376
What an honor it is

19:55.406 --> 19:58.824
to fulfill the final stage of the plan.

20:00.878 --> 20:03.128
Who else but you?

20:05.216 --> 20:07.666
Keep an eye on your mother, young man.

20:07.718 --> 20:09.585
Yes, sir.

20:11.088 --> 20:14.139
I will be back for both of you, shortly.

20:25.130 --> 20:27.241
_

20:36.447 --> 20:38.330
Mr. Desai...

20:40.868 --> 20:43.502
your duties are about to expand

20:43.537 --> 20:45.754
greatly.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.790
You will be pleased to learn

20:47.875 --> 20:49.708
that we have a great need

20:49.794 --> 20:51.710
for a helpful human confederate.

20:53.881 --> 20:56.548
That's very good to hear, Mr. Eichhorst.

20:58.886 --> 21:01.387
Thank you.

21:06.027 --> 21:09.695
Humans... think of evolution

21:09.730 --> 21:12.314
in terms of progress and advancement.

21:14.201 --> 21:17.403
This final errand will
be the catalyzing event

21:17.455 --> 21:21.156
precipitating a new era on Earth,

21:21.242 --> 21:24.576
akin to the meteor that
felled the dinosaurs

21:24.662 --> 21:27.046
and ushered in the Ice Age.

21:27.081 --> 21:30.332
I'm honoured, sir...

21:32.386 --> 21:34.503
and humbled.

21:36.474 --> 21:39.391
Once we dock,

21:39.427 --> 21:42.094
you will take the suitcase

21:42.146 --> 21:44.096
and place it exactly where I showed you

21:44.148 --> 21:46.065
on the map.

21:48.152 --> 21:50.936
Are you clear as to the location?

21:50.988 --> 21:53.072
Yes, sir. I am.

22:02.283 --> 22:05.117
Accursed sunlight,

22:05.169 --> 22:07.453
I shan't miss it.

22:10.374 --> 22:12.708
"Give me your tired,

22:12.793 --> 22:15.844
"your poor, your huddled masses

22:15.930 --> 22:18.847
"yearning to breathe free,

22:18.933 --> 22:21.717
"the wretched refuse
of your teeming shore.

22:21.802 --> 22:24.970
"Send these, the homeless,

22:25.022 --> 22:27.523
"tempest-tossed to me.

22:27.608 --> 22:29.725
"I lift my lamp

22:29.810 --> 22:31.977
beside the shining door."

23:09.206 --> 23:11.128
What is it?

23:11.158 --> 23:13.158
Go ahead. I'm going
to have a look around.

23:25.902 --> 23:27.979
Godspeed, everyone.

23:29.176 --> 23:31.293
You too, Professor.

23:48.896 --> 23:50.863
I'm not sanctimonious.

23:50.948 --> 23:53.782
You're just a hypocritical prick then?

23:55.987 --> 23:57.653
You slept with him.

23:59.824 --> 24:03.158
And?

24:03.210 --> 24:06.328
"And?"

24:24.315 --> 24:26.398
I don't want to fight with you.

24:28.486 --> 24:30.352
It's just, uh...

24:32.690 --> 24:35.858
I just wish that it'd ended up better

24:35.910 --> 24:38.410
between you and me, you know?

24:42.583 --> 24:45.501
We would be scratching each
other's eyes out by now.

24:45.536 --> 24:47.670
Haha!

24:50.374 --> 24:53.342
But I do, too.

25:00.051 --> 25:01.850
Housewares.

25:01.886 --> 25:03.802
This is me.

25:25.076 --> 25:26.992
Fet, I'm in. No one's here.

25:30.581 --> 25:32.581
Roger that.

25:32.633 --> 25:34.800
I'm in the service kitchen.

25:34.885 --> 25:36.719
Do you see Quinlan anywhere?

25:36.754 --> 25:39.755
No. No, I don't.

26:27.271 --> 26:29.104
Eldritch?

26:29.140 --> 26:30.939
Here.

26:30.975 --> 26:33.192
No sign of the Master yet.

26:33.277 --> 26:35.644
Excuse the mess.

26:38.199 --> 26:40.149
I admit

26:40.201 --> 26:42.117
I would like to have seen

26:42.153 --> 26:44.486
Eichhorst riddled with bullets.

26:44.538 --> 26:47.072
I'm sure you would.

26:47.158 --> 26:49.491
Dr. Goodweather, welcome.

26:49.543 --> 26:51.994
Strange bedfellows, eh?

26:52.079 --> 26:54.213
- Where's the bomb?
- It's near.

26:54.298 --> 26:56.165
It's safe.

27:05.176 --> 27:07.176
Everything all right, Eldritch?

27:07.261 --> 27:10.979
I'm a little anxious,
with the end so near.

27:15.853 --> 27:18.604
- What's happening?
- Uh, Eph and Setrakian

27:18.689 --> 27:20.355
are with Palmer in
the penthouse, talking.

27:27.915 --> 27:29.865
Miriam's heart.

27:29.917 --> 27:33.085
Yours to take of course.

27:33.170 --> 27:35.704
You loved her very much.

27:35.790 --> 27:39.708
How many years has it been, Abraham?

27:39.794 --> 27:41.844
Too many.

27:41.879 --> 27:45.264
And you, Dr. Goodweather,

27:45.349 --> 27:46.799
your wife...

27:48.719 --> 27:52.938
- What about her?
- Sad situation.

27:53.023 --> 27:57.226
- Your son though...
- What about my son?

27:57.278 --> 27:58.894
A fine boy.

27:58.979 --> 28:01.563
Great potential.

28:01.649 --> 28:04.233
- You've never met my son.
- Zack has

28:04.285 --> 28:06.568
a dark heart, don't you think?

28:06.654 --> 28:09.788
- What are you talking about?
- Ephraim, get back!

28:09.874 --> 28:12.241
Why are you talking about my son?!

28:12.293 --> 28:14.376
Ugh!

28:14.411 --> 28:16.295
Oh, shit! Fet, they're fighting.

28:16.380 --> 28:18.497
- With Palmer.
- Turn the jammer on!

28:18.582 --> 28:20.415
Turn it on now!

28:24.555 --> 28:26.421
Fet, give me a sec!

28:56.036 --> 28:58.453
Ugh! He jumped

28:58.539 --> 29:00.339
into Palmer's body.
He's playing with us.

29:00.424 --> 29:03.926
You should have ended it
when you had the chance!

29:03.961 --> 29:06.261
The taking of a soul is
but another blood meal,

29:06.297 --> 29:08.463
but your suffering,

29:08.549 --> 29:10.799
this is a delicacy.

29:14.638 --> 29:17.105
Dutch!

29:17.141 --> 29:20.309
Come on! Come on!

29:20.394 --> 29:22.394
Oh, you're unplugged,
you little bastard!

29:31.071 --> 29:34.239
What are you going to do?
Chop my head off again?

29:38.796 --> 29:41.830
No, we have something else in mind.

29:41.882 --> 29:43.498
Aaaah!

30:17.952 --> 30:19.668
Argh!

30:21.872 --> 30:23.705
Aaaah!

31:01.245 --> 31:03.829
Aaah!

31:29.894 --> 31:32.845
- He's in there?
- Yeah.

31:35.483 --> 31:38.517
Oh, my God! Eph!

31:38.569 --> 31:40.519
It's superficial.

31:40.605 --> 31:42.521
It didn't hit the muscle.

31:42.607 --> 31:45.107
Sure as hell doesn't look like
it's bleeding superficially.

31:45.192 --> 31:47.192
Our job is only
half-done. We need to get

31:47.278 --> 31:49.194
this box to the bottom
of the ocean as soon

31:49.280 --> 31:50.996
as possible.

31:53.284 --> 31:56.702
I'm staying. You need
help with the wound.

31:56.787 --> 31:59.038
Van's downstairs.

31:59.090 --> 32:01.957
- We need to go.
- Palmer's got all sorts

32:02.043 --> 32:04.293
- of medical equipment here.
- The jammer.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.714
- It worked.
- Yeah.

32:08.799 --> 32:11.717
Take it with you. It'll be helpful
if you run into some strigoi.

32:11.802 --> 32:15.471
- Well, who's gonna help you?
- I'm a doctor, remember?

32:17.558 --> 32:19.858
Go.

32:21.779 --> 32:23.729
OK.

32:23.814 --> 32:26.649
But we'll be back soon, OK?

32:26.734 --> 32:29.818
- Don't die.
- Let's go!

32:56.263 --> 32:58.764
Sir, are you all right?

32:58.849 --> 33:01.316
I hear nothing.

33:01.402 --> 33:04.103
There is no voice.

33:04.188 --> 33:05.904
Hear?

33:05.940 --> 33:08.073
- Who?
- Drive

33:08.109 --> 33:10.109
to Stoneheart headquarters!

33:10.194 --> 33:12.111
- Immediately!
- Yes, sir.

33:19.754 --> 33:22.621
Mom?

33:22.673 --> 33:24.957
The Master...

33:25.009 --> 33:26.959
I cannot hear him.

33:27.044 --> 33:29.228
You can't...

33:29.258 --> 33:32.347
You can't what?

33:47.281 --> 33:49.314
The Master's right upstairs.

33:51.619 --> 33:54.536
Let's just go see him.

33:54.622 --> 33:57.656
Come on, Mom.

34:17.844 --> 34:20.012
Ugh!

34:36.246 --> 34:38.112
Oh!

34:58.986 --> 35:01.203
Zack?

35:01.289 --> 35:04.540
Dad?

35:07.495 --> 35:10.496
No! Stop!

35:10.581 --> 35:12.965
No, get off!

35:13.000 --> 35:15.634
Please, just stop!

35:15.670 --> 35:17.386
Mom!

35:17.472 --> 35:19.889
Stop it, please!

35:19.974 --> 35:22.091
Dad!

35:22.176 --> 35:24.176
- Ugh!
- No, don't!

35:31.769 --> 35:34.019
Mom!

35:37.191 --> 35:39.492
Mom.

35:58.575 --> 36:00.338
_

36:00.368 --> 36:02.149
Get back!

36:30.628 --> 36:32.161
Are you OK?

36:40.021 --> 36:42.355
It's over.

36:44.793 --> 36:48.128
It's all over now.
You're safe. You're...

36:52.967 --> 36:55.434
You know what that is?

36:55.469 --> 36:57.302
Yeah.

37:02.193 --> 37:05.194
Give that to me.

37:05.279 --> 37:07.317
I hate you!

37:16.007 --> 37:18.391
Oh, shit! Get to cover!

37:18.426 --> 37:21.177
Behind the wall! Come on!

37:25.099 --> 37:26.265
Quinlan!

38:34.836 --> 38:37.002
No. No.

38:42.226 --> 38:44.093
Where are you?

38:56.774 --> 38:58.691
He's gone.

39:24.769 --> 39:26.635
Oof!

39:32.560 --> 39:35.394
Zack?!

39:39.817 --> 39:41.734
Help.

39:45.206 --> 39:47.206
- Aaaah!
- Get up!

39:49.377 --> 39:52.044
Please help me!

39:52.079 --> 39:53.996
Please!

40:06.427 --> 40:09.762
Mr. Eichhorst.

40:09.847 --> 40:11.096
Mr. Eichhorst.

40:13.317 --> 40:15.601
Help me. Please.

40:19.824 --> 40:22.491
Please. Please.

40:22.577 --> 40:24.777
Help me.

40:32.870 --> 40:34.954
- Has anyone seen my son?
- What's happening?

40:35.039 --> 40:37.623
Anyone, please!

40:37.708 --> 40:40.259
Help!

40:40.294 --> 40:43.012
Where did she go?!

40:43.097 --> 40:45.080
Help me!

40:58.145 --> 40:59.778
Where's Kelly?

41:05.036 --> 41:07.953
My dad...

41:07.989 --> 41:10.205
killed her.

41:10.291 --> 41:13.042
I'm sorry, Zack.

41:22.803 --> 41:24.420
Well done, son.

41:26.140 --> 41:30.342
Thanks to you, we are well again.

41:30.394 --> 41:31.844
Come.

41:31.929 --> 41:34.263
Come.

41:40.271 --> 41:43.405
- Oh, my God!
- If the fallout blows this way,

41:43.491 --> 41:45.357
we're not gonna have
to worry about strigoi.

41:45.409 --> 41:48.527
We'll be glowing. We
gotta get underground.

41:48.613 --> 41:51.280
- We have to find him.
- You want to get irradiated?

41:51.365 --> 41:53.699
Be my guest.

42:01.709 --> 42:05.010
The occultation.

42:20.695 --> 42:23.312
Zack!

42:23.397 --> 42:25.814
You're gonna be OK. You're gonna be OK.

42:30.788 --> 42:32.705
Zack!
