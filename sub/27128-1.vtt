01:56.898 --> 01:58.631
Good afternoon, Donna.

01:58.633 --> 02:01.033
I only had one customer
come by this week.

02:01.035 --> 02:02.501
He didn't even spend
the night, just...

02:03.939 --> 02:06.339
I swear to God, whoever
taught you manners.

02:06.341 --> 02:09.074
We're gonna hit the rewind
button, start this one over.

02:09.077 --> 02:09.912
Okay?

02:19.121 --> 02:20.422
Good afternoon, Donna.

02:21.522 --> 02:22.855
Good afternoon, Zane.

02:22.857 --> 02:24.024
How are we doing today?

02:24.026 --> 02:25.658
Just
fine, and yourself?

02:25.660 --> 02:28.728
Oh, I'm all right.

02:28.730 --> 02:30.964
My mother's back in
the hospital again.

02:30.966 --> 02:32.601
The emphysema's getting ugly.

02:34.503 --> 02:37.773
But other than that,
uh, I can't complain.

02:40.008 --> 02:42.641
Anyhow, I'd love to stay and
chat but I'm afraid I got me

02:42.643 --> 02:44.747
a whole laundry list
of things to do today.

02:46.047 --> 02:49.014
Let me guess, you had
one customer this week?

02:49.016 --> 02:50.049
That's right.

02:50.051 --> 02:51.016
And he had a nap?

02:51.018 --> 02:52.452
- And a meal?
- Yeah.

02:52.454 --> 02:54.020
- You charge him by the hour?
- Uh huh.

02:54.022 --> 02:54.988
How many hours?

02:54.990 --> 02:55.855
Three?

02:55.857 --> 02:57.556
Okay, so plus a
meal, that's $60.

02:57.558 --> 02:59.061
20% of 60 is...

03:00.129 --> 03:01.995
Oh, I got two bucks inside.

03:01.997 --> 03:03.196
You're getting good at this.

03:03.198 --> 03:05.031
I remember when you used to
take awhile to do the math.

03:05.033 --> 03:07.601
You know what, you keep it.

03:07.603 --> 03:08.935
No, no,
no, I got it inside...

03:08.937 --> 03:10.406
No, no, no, no, no, I insist.

03:13.141 --> 03:13.975
Okay.

03:18.045 --> 03:21.580
Hey, you, uh, you didn't happen

03:21.582 --> 03:23.985
to offer anything
extra, did you?

03:25.587 --> 03:27.086
Considering I haven't
done that in close

03:27.088 --> 03:29.692
to 20 years I'll let you
figure out the answer.

03:33.061 --> 03:34.627
I'm just checking.

03:34.629 --> 03:36.531
Gotta check, okay?

03:38.133 --> 03:39.768
You have yourself a nice day.

with you, what,

04:09.130 --> 04:12.097
we had to turn people away.

04:12.099 --> 04:14.633
Both rooms were booked up.

04:14.635 --> 04:16.535
Someone was in the
kitchen having a meal,

04:16.536 --> 04:18.003
people were stopping in.

04:18.005 --> 04:21.107
It was like the Super 8.

I don't know.

04:51.039 --> 04:53.039

05:11.693 --> 05:12.527
Yeah.

05:14.796 --> 05:16.032
Yeah, he was nice.

05:19.133 --> 05:21.167
You didn't marry him?

05:21.169 --> 05:23.806
No, I didn't get married.

05:25.274 --> 05:26.108
Why not?

05:29.111 --> 05:32.181
'Cause I, I didn't
feel for him that way.

05:34.549 --> 05:36.218
Nor did he for me.

05:37.286 --> 05:39.085
You know, when you get married,

05:39.087 --> 05:41.121
you gotta really love someone.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.989
'Cause when you get
married it's forever.

05:43.991 --> 05:45.494
At least, it's supposed to be.

05:46.628 --> 05:48.561
So they gotta be
your favorite person

05:48.563 --> 05:50.232

05:53.200 --> 05:55.037

gonna get married?

05:55.971 --> 05:58.237
No, I think my
ship has sailed.

05:58.239 --> 06:00.006
But you will.

06:00.008 --> 06:01.010
You'll get married.

kidding, all right?

07:59.960 --> 08:01.460
I got a headache.

08:01.462 --> 08:03.196
- Goodbye!
- Headaches don't mean

08:03.198 --> 08:06.001
that you can't...

08:21.717 --> 08:22.351
Yeah.

08:28.924 --> 08:29.758

08:55.350 --> 08:57.149
'cause I pay for
the damned things.

08:57.151 --> 08:58.353
I have a right to ask.

Hey, when do uh, when
do most women get

09:05.526 --> 09:08.163

what do you call it?

09:09.130 --> 09:11.297
- What, hit menopause?
- Yeah.

09:11.299 --> 09:13.736
I don't know, like,
mid-40s I guess.

09:15.770 --> 09:18.104
You're 40, shit, so
that's like another

09:18.106 --> 09:20.076
five years give or take?

09:21.342 --> 09:24.511
Well, you might get
tired of me before then.

09:28.183 --> 09:29.351
Yeah, maybe.

09:31.052 --> 09:33.353
Not a lotta options in these
parts, that's for sure.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.424
It's either you or
Helen the Heifer.

09:36.824 --> 09:40.395

Helen the Heifer, but.

He's touched.

10:16.463 --> 10:19.167
Touched implies God had
something to do with it.

Oh, hardly.

12:17.452 --> 12:18.287
Oh, good.

12:19.353 --> 12:20.619
Good, name's Cam.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.654
Cameron Lewis,
everybody calls me Cam.

12:22.656 --> 12:25.157
Hi, Cam, Donna,
nice to meet you.

12:25.159 --> 12:26.692
You plan on spending the night?

12:26.694 --> 12:28.427
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

12:28.429 --> 12:31.364
Uh, but first thing's first,
I'd love a wash and a shave

12:31.366 --> 12:32.598
and some food, too,
if you don't mind.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.004
Yeah, of course, it's
what we're here for.

12:38.606 --> 12:39.575
Sorry, you don't.

12:40.674 --> 12:42.111
You don't remember me, do ya?

12:44.178 --> 12:45.345
Should I?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.446
Oh, no, no, suppose,
I suppose not.

12:47.448 --> 12:49.548
I remember you, though, I
stayed here a long time ago.

12:49.550 --> 12:52.185
I'm sure I looked different
then but you don't.

12:52.187 --> 12:54.420
You don't look a
day older, ma'am.

12:54.422 --> 12:57.724
And uh, you showed me a
good time, a real good time,

12:57.726 --> 12:59.157
you know, it was
memorable for me,

12:59.159 --> 13:01.329
but maybe not for you, so.

13:04.598 --> 13:07.669
Uh, sure, yeah,
I remember you.

13:09.036 --> 13:11.706
Um, it's nice to
see you again, Cam.

13:13.441 --> 13:15.707
Uh, I'm afraid that
things have changed

13:15.709 --> 13:18.277
in the years since
you've been here.

13:18.279 --> 13:21.114
I have a son now and this
here is where we live

13:21.116 --> 13:23.582
so we're still a fully
operational bread and breakfast

13:23.584 --> 13:25.350
but that's all we
are, you understand?

13:25.352 --> 13:27.152
Yes, I think I do.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.388
Okay.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.555
So if that's not what
you're lookin' for,

13:29.557 --> 13:30.558
I just can't help you.

13:31.726 --> 13:33.393
Well, no, like
I said, I just uh,

13:33.395 --> 13:35.728
I'd love a bar of soap
and a razor if you got one

13:35.730 --> 13:37.162
and something warm to eat.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.465
Yeah, that we can
most certainly do.

13:39.467 --> 13:41.367
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

13:41.369 --> 13:42.204
All right.

14:11.598 --> 14:12.831
So what
brings you back

14:12.833 --> 14:14.535
around after all this time?

14:15.736 --> 14:18.303
Well, the truth is,
I never really left.

14:18.305 --> 14:21.075
Been an inmate over at
Four Corners Prison.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.710
The plan is to take
a bus back home

14:25.712 --> 14:27.613
see my brother and his now wife.

14:27.615 --> 14:29.685
I haven't seen them
in close to 20 years.

14:30.751 --> 14:32.652
You were in prison
that whole time?

14:32.654 --> 14:33.621
Yes, ma'am.

14:35.789 --> 14:37.190
What for?

14:37.192 --> 14:39.224
Well, only one
thing can get you put

14:39.226 --> 14:40.460
in prison for that
long and it ain't

14:40.462 --> 14:42.360
something I enjoy
talking about, but,

14:42.362 --> 14:44.497
this being your house and all.

14:44.499 --> 14:46.702
You got every right to
ask me anything you want.

14:48.169 --> 14:49.704
I don't need to
know the details.

14:50.771 --> 14:51.806
Good.

14:54.275 --> 14:58.347
Just know that, uh, I'm what
they call rehabilitated.

14:59.514 --> 15:02.481
Studied the Bible
every night in there

15:02.483 --> 15:03.550
and I don't mean to
bring any trouble

15:03.552 --> 15:08.287
or disrespect to this
home or anyone or anything

15:08.289 --> 15:09.721
until my time is
up on this earth.

15:09.723 --> 15:11.691
That's about all I do know.

15:11.693 --> 15:12.827
I appreciate that.

15:16.430 --> 15:18.464
Hope you're not put off.

15:18.466 --> 15:19.301
No.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.603
No, I've done things
I'm not proud of.

15:23.804 --> 15:25.738
I mean, people don't
understand it's all

15:25.740 --> 15:27.509
a matter of circumstance.

15:28.775 --> 15:33.714
The less fortunate you are,
the more desperate you are,

15:35.750 --> 15:37.852
the greater chance you
got at screwing up.

15:38.852 --> 15:41.255
I believe most people
have a good heart.

15:42.856 --> 15:45.557
Just life has this
way of squeezing out

15:45.559 --> 15:47.195
that little bit of bad and then

15:48.862 --> 15:50.465
well, that's all people can see.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.431
Do you read the Bible?

15:53.433 --> 15:54.303
Book of Matthew?

15:55.702 --> 15:58.106
No, I'm not one for
religion or readin'.

15:59.473 --> 16:01.606
Seems like you live
by it, read it or not.

16:01.608 --> 16:04.278
There's this part in there
about, uh, judging others.

16:06.347 --> 16:07.749
I can see you don't do that.

16:09.516 --> 16:10.351
Guess not.

16:12.419 --> 16:13.319
Can I take your plate?

16:13.321 --> 16:13.952
Yes, ma'am.

16:13.954 --> 16:15.289
It was delicious.

18:49.343 --> 18:50.943
Did you sleep okay?

18:50.945 --> 18:51.980
Yes, ma'am.

18:54.015 --> 18:56.485
Been sleeping on a
cardboard box all this time.

18:57.884 --> 18:59.819
Felt every damn bedspring
for close to 20 years,

18:59.821 --> 19:01.553
you don't know how well I slept.

19:01.555 --> 19:02.623
I'm living in luxury.

19:05.892 --> 19:08.796
So this place,
um, change at all?

19:09.897 --> 19:10.896
Coulda sworn it was different.

19:10.898 --> 19:12.063
It's been so long.

19:12.065 --> 19:13.532
Oh yeah.

19:13.534 --> 19:16.068
Well, for one, there
was no Jimmy's room.

19:16.070 --> 19:17.503
That was my bedroom.

19:17.505 --> 19:19.738
So I had two rooms for rent.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.876
My room now, plus
the one you're in.

19:22.976 --> 19:26.111
Yeah, yeah, I think
I stayed in your room.

19:26.113 --> 19:28.046
That makes sense.

19:28.048 --> 19:30.318
Yeah, it's all
coming back to me.

19:32.018 --> 19:33.651
So you plan on
heading out today?

19:33.653 --> 19:35.423
Well, you know,
I thought I was.

19:36.923 --> 19:38.991
Maybe another night
would do me good.

19:38.993 --> 19:41.926
My brother's just gonna put me
on his couch or on the floor,

19:41.928 --> 19:43.596
he don't have much in the
way of accommodations,

19:43.598 --> 19:46.031
so maybe I treat myself
to another night.

19:46.033 --> 19:47.433
If you're not already booked.

19:47.435 --> 19:51.035
Oh no, there's no
reservations here.

19:51.037 --> 19:51.971
Great!

19:51.973 --> 19:53.671
Well, I'll go get my wallet.

19:53.673 --> 19:55.407
Oh, no, no, you stay
put, that's all right.

19:55.409 --> 19:56.942
You can give it to me later.

19:56.944 --> 19:58.046
Good morning, pumpkin.

19:58.946 --> 20:00.615
Come say hi to our guest.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.481
- Hi.
- Howdy.

20:02.483 --> 20:03.882
Name's Cam, Cameron Lewis.

20:03.884 --> 20:05.517
Everybody calls me Cam.

20:05.519 --> 20:07.753
I was just telling your mom
what a great place you got here.

20:07.755 --> 20:09.754
I make all of the
beds and I do all

20:09.756 --> 20:12.957
of the grocery shopping so
everyone can eat that comes in.

20:12.959 --> 20:16.161
Oh, those are two
very important jobs.

20:16.163 --> 20:19.066
I guess I should thank you
for my delicious breakfast.

20:21.636 --> 20:23.135
You want some
orange juice, honey?

20:23.137 --> 20:24.438
Yes, please.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.843
- Spiderman, snack time.
- Here you go.

20:30.076 --> 20:31.746
He make a good
pet, that rabbit?

20:32.780 --> 20:33.982
- Yes.
- Yeah, I suppose.

20:48.094 --> 20:49.727
Bang!

20:49.729 --> 20:51.062
Whoa!

20:51.064 --> 20:52.164
This a stickup?

20:52.166 --> 20:53.599
No.

20:53.601 --> 20:54.733
No?

20:54.735 --> 20:55.504
What then?

20:56.169 --> 20:57.770
It's broke.

20:57.772 --> 20:58.607
Ah.

21:00.740 --> 21:01.809
Broke, let me see it.

21:02.843 --> 21:04.209
I got it at the
store awhile ago

21:04.211 --> 21:06.244
but they don't make it anymore.

21:06.246 --> 21:07.082
Oh yeah?

21:08.149 --> 21:10.115
Oh, there you go.

21:10.117 --> 21:11.586
Just jammed, is all.

21:13.086 --> 21:14.121
Let's see.

21:15.590 --> 21:16.425
Yeah.

21:17.891 --> 21:19.224
It should work now.

21:19.226 --> 21:22.061
Be careful, these BBs hurt,

21:22.063 --> 21:23.228
don't go shooting
people with it.

21:23.230 --> 21:25.166
Well, what do I shoot then?

21:26.167 --> 21:27.169
Cans?

21:29.035 --> 21:30.471
You never shot cans?

21:31.738 --> 21:32.372
You wanna?

21:34.207 --> 21:36.074
Why don't you go ask your mom

21:36.076 --> 21:37.510
if you can shoot
some cans with me?

21:37.512 --> 21:38.644
All right?

21:38.646 --> 21:39.481
I'll wait here.

21:46.152 --> 21:50.054
Mom, can I go outside
and shoot cans with Mr. Cam?

21:50.056 --> 21:52.757
Uh, what,
you're gonna shoot cans?

21:52.759 --> 21:54.193
I'm gonna
shoot cans with the BB.

21:56.162 --> 21:59.233
All right,
if Cam wants to.

23:05.065 --> 23:06.133
She said yes.

23:09.169 --> 23:10.205
There we go.

23:12.305 --> 23:13.038
All right.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.939
- Can I try it now?
- Yeah.

23:14.941 --> 23:15.776
Yeah.

23:17.210 --> 23:19.078
Now, what you wanna do,
you wanna close one eye,

23:19.080 --> 23:21.013
and keep your dominant
eye open, okay?

23:21.015 --> 23:22.246
What?

23:22.248 --> 23:24.117
Your better eye, which
one's your better eye?

23:25.149 --> 23:26.685
Doesn't matter, doesn't
matter, just one eye, okay?

23:26.687 --> 23:29.157
Line up the front sight
onto the target, okay?

23:30.791 --> 23:32.256
There you go, keep it level.

23:32.258 --> 23:35.226
Now, think about that gun as
an extension of your arm, okay?

23:35.228 --> 23:36.361
Now, I don't want you to pull,

23:36.363 --> 23:38.796
I want you to
squeeze that trigger.

23:39.633 --> 23:40.299
Yeah!

23:40.301 --> 23:41.367
There you go!

23:41.369 --> 23:42.502
- I did it.
- Kid's a natural!

23:42.504 --> 23:44.369
Same with the real thing,
you just get a little bit

23:44.371 --> 23:47.305
of kick back and it's
a bit loader, but...

23:49.377 --> 23:51.212
Oh, it's all
right, I know him.

24:00.053 --> 24:01.052
Afternoon.

24:01.054 --> 24:02.321
Good afternoon, Zane.

24:02.323 --> 24:03.321
Howdy.

24:03.323 --> 24:04.523
Shooting some BBs.

24:04.525 --> 24:08.292
Oh, shucks, I thought I'd get
me some excitement for once.

24:09.229 --> 24:10.361
Sorry to get your hopes up.

24:10.363 --> 24:12.965
Name's Cam, Cameron Lewis.

24:12.967 --> 24:14.966
Ah, Zane.

24:14.968 --> 24:16.267
I'm the sheriff here.

24:16.269 --> 24:17.972
Also an old friend of Donna's.

24:19.105 --> 24:20.304
How's the bed and
breakfast treatin' ya?

24:20.306 --> 24:21.139
Very well.

24:21.141 --> 24:22.274
Very well, thank you.

24:22.276 --> 24:23.942
Well, if you're gonna
stay awhile I can recommend

24:23.944 --> 24:25.843
a couple of spots if you
feel like getting out.

24:25.845 --> 24:28.013
Oh, no, no, thanks,
I'm just passing by.

24:28.015 --> 24:30.081
I figured that
was the case, yes.

24:30.083 --> 24:33.418
That's what everyone does 'cause
it's just that kinda town.

24:33.420 --> 24:35.420
Reckon I was passing by, too.

24:35.422 --> 24:37.289
I stopped a little
longer than I thought

24:37.291 --> 24:40.324
and next thing I knew
I was the damn sheriff.

24:41.361 --> 24:43.462
Pretty sweet deal to me.

24:43.464 --> 24:44.332
Yeah, its okay.

24:45.365 --> 24:46.266
It's okay.

24:47.767 --> 24:49.234
So from where to where?

24:49.236 --> 24:50.468
Sorry?

24:50.470 --> 24:52.236
Just passing by, where you
coming from, where you going?

24:52.238 --> 24:53.371
Jimmy, stop!

24:53.373 --> 24:55.006
You do not point that at people.

24:55.008 --> 24:56.841
Only at cans, okay?

24:56.843 --> 24:58.711
- I wasn't gonna shoot it.
- I don't care!

24:58.713 --> 25:00.949
That is the rule,
otherwise I take it away.

25:02.416 --> 25:05.917
Yeah, I did try to tell him
if that makes any difference.

25:05.919 --> 25:06.553
It's all right.

25:08.389 --> 25:09.921
Donna, let's talk a minute.

25:09.923 --> 25:10.891
Excuse us.

25:15.763 --> 25:16.427
Handsome.

25:16.429 --> 25:17.830
I suppose.

25:17.832 --> 25:18.664
You really have to suppose?

25:18.666 --> 25:20.264
I'm a man and even
I can see that.

25:20.266 --> 25:21.833
Sure, he's handsome.

25:21.835 --> 25:23.301
Do I gotta
start wearing a rubber?

25:23.303 --> 25:24.936
Oh, don't be vulgar.

25:24.938 --> 25:26.871
You have every right, but
I have just as much right,

25:26.873 --> 25:28.840
I ain't going where
someone else has been.

25:28.842 --> 25:30.876
Jesus, Zane.

25:30.878 --> 25:33.411
I am not fucking him, I told
you I don't do that no more,

25:33.413 --> 25:34.682
he's a customer.

25:36.082 --> 25:37.448
How many nights?

25:37.450 --> 25:38.349
One so far.

25:38.351 --> 25:39.917
- Meals?
- Yeah.

25:39.919 --> 25:42.154
Okay, go get it, I'll wait.

25:42.156 --> 25:43.358
He hasn't paid me yet.

25:44.390 --> 25:45.456
He has...

25:45.458 --> 25:47.027
Well, why the hell not?

25:48.262 --> 25:50.262
Just, I just
haven't had the time.

25:50.264 --> 25:52.296
You always get
the money up front.

25:52.298 --> 25:54.233
Now he's already
spent the damn night

25:54.235 --> 25:55.501
and ate your damn food.

25:55.503 --> 25:57.235
What are you gonna do when he
says he don't have the money?

25:57.237 --> 25:59.440
- He's not gonna say...
- What would you do?

26:01.408 --> 26:04.245
You'd come crying to me,
that's what you'd do.

26:06.813 --> 26:08.981
It's like I have to stay on top
of you for every damn thing.

26:08.983 --> 26:11.282
Running a simple business,
you can't even do that right.

26:11.284 --> 26:12.784
Rule number fucking one.

26:12.786 --> 26:15.186
Look, I will go inside
and I'll get the money.

26:15.188 --> 26:16.420
Come back tomorrow
and I'll pay you.

26:16.422 --> 26:18.023
I don't wanna
be here tomorrow,

26:18.025 --> 26:18.957
I got stuff to do tomorrow.

26:18.959 --> 26:20.359
All right, then
come back another day.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.463
No, I'll come tomorrow.

26:25.900 --> 26:27.468
It was nice meetin' ya!

26:33.506 --> 26:36.440
What do you say we switch to
something a little stronger?

26:36.442 --> 26:37.842
On the house, of course.

26:37.844 --> 26:39.011
That'd be nice.

26:39.013 --> 26:40.244
Yeah, what do you like?

26:40.246 --> 26:42.046
I'm afraid I don't
have a full bar.

26:42.048 --> 26:43.815
Well, it don't matter,
you pour it, I'll drink it.

26:43.817 --> 26:44.818
All right.

26:47.487 --> 26:48.523
Cheers.

26:56.229 --> 26:57.064
God.

26:59.132 --> 27:00.099
What.

27:00.101 --> 27:01.399
I haven't had one of
these in a long time.

27:01.401 --> 27:03.004
Not used to it.

27:04.604 --> 27:06.170
Prolly got the tolerance
of a high school girl.

27:06.172 --> 27:07.472
Well as
long as I don't have

27:07.474 --> 27:08.506
to hold your hair back.

27:12.446 --> 27:13.611
Smoke?

27:13.613 --> 27:15.150
No thanks, I don't smoke.

27:16.449 --> 27:18.318
Quit in prison.

27:19.285 --> 27:20.121
Wow.

27:22.389 --> 27:23.589
That's an odd place to quit.

27:23.591 --> 27:25.424
Tell me about it.

27:25.426 --> 27:28.627
Like currency in there,
kinda gives you a leg up.

27:28.629 --> 27:29.994
If that makes sense.

27:29.996 --> 27:30.832
Yeah, it does.

27:31.497 --> 27:32.833
Yeah, I couldn't do it.

27:34.001 --> 27:34.836
Oh.

27:36.402 --> 27:39.370
I wanna thank you
for what you did today.

27:39.372 --> 27:41.540
Oh, no, it's nothing.

27:41.542 --> 27:42.510
No, really.

27:44.143 --> 27:47.478
You know, he don't have a
man around and sometimes

27:47.480 --> 27:49.550
I forget how important that is.

27:50.884 --> 27:53.086
What it does to be
able to do guy stuff.

27:54.521 --> 27:56.057
And he was really happy.

27:57.925 --> 28:00.559
Then I had to go ruin
it and yell at him.

28:00.561 --> 28:02.026
Oh, you didn't
do nothing wrong,

28:02.028 --> 28:03.263
you were just being safe.

28:07.066 --> 28:08.535
Yeah, I know.

28:10.103 --> 28:12.940
Sometimes I forget that
he just don't know better.

28:14.641 --> 28:16.073
You know?

28:16.075 --> 28:18.045
I just wanna shake
the hell outta him.

28:19.545 --> 28:21.114
But then I know he means well.

28:22.248 --> 28:27.020
He's just so good and simple.

28:30.623 --> 28:31.860
You're doing your best.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.930
I can tell you from
someone who had a bad mom.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.465
But you ain't that.

28:40.467 --> 28:41.636
Not by a long shot.

28:43.603 --> 28:44.438
Thank you.

28:49.243 --> 28:50.611
Can I ask you something?

28:53.179 --> 28:56.650
When you came by here,
were you looking for a lay?

28:59.620 --> 29:02.119
Hey, I guess so.

29:02.121 --> 29:03.554
- But I didn't...
- I mean,

29:03.556 --> 29:04.925
did you think about me?

29:06.127 --> 29:08.596
And the time we spent together
while you were in prison?

29:10.698 --> 29:12.100
Yes, ma'am, I did.

29:15.069 --> 29:18.505
And was it good
that I can't remember?

29:19.605 --> 29:20.540
Was I good?

29:23.677 --> 29:27.713
Well, without much
basis for comparison

29:27.715 --> 29:30.318
I can tell you.

29:31.651 --> 29:32.687

33:50.276 --> 33:51.946
How long is he usually
out there playing?

33:53.280 --> 33:54.448
He could be some time.

33:55.681 --> 33:57.384
What are you proposin'?

34:32.284 --> 34:32.918
Oh that?

34:35.054 --> 34:37.257
That's just a birthmark.

34:38.556 --> 34:39.791
Well, I can't do
anything about it,

34:39.793 --> 34:41.428
I was born with
the damned thing.

34:42.928 --> 34:44.797
Uh, no, it's just that um.

34:48.534 --> 34:50.004
Jimmy has the same mark.

34:59.979 --> 35:01.979
What do you suppose we do now?

35:01.981 --> 35:03.516
I don't care, honestly.

35:04.651 --> 35:05.850
And I'm not looking
for any handouts

35:05.852 --> 35:08.787
and I don't need your
help raising my son.

35:08.789 --> 35:10.591
I've been doing
just fine on my own.

35:11.992 --> 35:12.890
Well then why does it,

35:12.892 --> 35:15.563
sounds like you're
angry or something.

35:17.930 --> 35:18.932
I'm not.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.302
I am just processin'.

35:23.035 --> 35:25.003
Look, I had no idea
who the father was

35:25.005 --> 35:29.039
and now that I might I'm
just lettin' it sink in.

35:29.041 --> 35:29.876
That's all.

35:34.481 --> 35:36.513
I'm also wonderin' if...

35:36.515 --> 35:37.751
If you should tell him.

35:39.052 --> 35:40.553
That's entirely up to you.

35:41.421 --> 35:42.056
I know.

35:56.035 --> 35:58.039
So where are you headed
when you leave here?

35:59.872 --> 36:02.043
Where's your brother live?

36:05.010 --> 36:07.447
Afraid I haven't been
completely honest with you.

36:08.115 --> 36:10.448
I'm not going to see my brother.

36:10.450 --> 36:11.383
Okay.

36:11.385 --> 36:12.950
I'm going to Mexico.

36:12.952 --> 36:14.385
What's in Mexico?

36:14.387 --> 36:16.656
It's not what's there,
it's what's not there.

36:19.059 --> 36:23.030
There's some people here
I'd rather not bump into.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.465
I thought you said you were

36:27.467 --> 36:29.133
what they called rehabilitated.

36:29.135 --> 36:31.671
I am, they're not.

36:32.671 --> 36:33.640
That's the problem.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.073
Morning, Jimmy.

36:36.075 --> 36:37.841
- Good morning.
- Morning, Jimmy.

36:37.843 --> 36:38.678
Hi.

36:39.945 --> 36:41.381
Hey, thank you.

36:42.715 --> 36:44.718
So are you gonna
stay another night?

36:46.619 --> 36:47.621
Afraid not, kid.

36:49.889 --> 36:52.459
Hey, Jimmy, why don't you
go outside and get some air?

36:54.059 --> 36:55.459
But I just came in.

36:55.461 --> 36:57.128
So why don't you
take Spiderman outside

36:57.130 --> 36:58.698
and get him some fresh air?

37:02.202 --> 37:03.635
Okay.

37:03.637 --> 37:04.972
Okay, but don't leave
him outta your sight.

37:11.811 --> 37:13.010
Come on, Spiderman,

37:13.012 --> 37:16.683
I think they don't want
us inside right now.

37:34.034 --> 37:37.167
Hey listen, I don't mean
to be rude or offend you

37:37.169 --> 37:42.175
or nothing, but Jimmy, what's,
what's his malfunction?

37:44.211 --> 37:47.211
You know, I only ask
'cause if I am the father...

37:47.213 --> 37:49.717
It'd have nothing to
do with you regardless.

37:51.084 --> 37:53.517
I gave birth to him here,
and during the birth

37:53.519 --> 37:57.488
something got all mixed
around and the umbilical cord

37:57.490 --> 37:59.122
was wrapped around his neck.

37:59.124 --> 38:01.091
That scar he got, you
noticed that, right?

38:01.093 --> 38:02.794
Yeah.

38:02.796 --> 38:04.829
He wasn't breathing for
awhile and I finally got

38:04.831 --> 38:09.100
it off him and I
think it did something

38:09.102 --> 38:12.202
to his head 'cause he's
never been quite right.

38:12.204 --> 38:13.206
Spiderman!

38:19.945 --> 38:20.780
Spiderman!

38:28.088 --> 38:28.956
Spiderman!

38:34.793 --> 38:35.628
Spiderman!

38:39.932 --> 38:40.767
There you are.

38:50.543 --> 38:51.177
Hey there.

38:52.979 --> 38:53.814
Hi.

38:55.148 --> 38:56.914
Hospitality.

38:56.916 --> 38:58.916
I could use some of that.

38:58.918 --> 38:59.752
You work here?

39:00.986 --> 39:05.055
Yes, I make the beds and I
do all of the grocery shopping

39:05.057 --> 39:06.260
so everybody can eat.

39:07.126 --> 39:09.861
Well, you wanna see me inside?

39:09.863 --> 39:11.262
Sure.

39:11.264 --> 39:14.097
My mom's in there right now,
though, with a customer.

39:14.099 --> 39:15.168
His name is Cam.

39:16.302 --> 39:17.637
But he's leaving today.

39:18.838 --> 39:19.773
Oh he is, is he?

39:23.209 --> 39:25.546
Mama, we got another customer.

39:27.847 --> 39:28.682
Oh.

39:30.215 --> 39:31.249
Hello.

39:31.251 --> 39:32.749
Hi, Joe.

39:32.751 --> 39:35.119
But you can call me The Boss.

39:35.121 --> 39:36.354
Uh, boss of what?

39:36.356 --> 39:38.622
Uh, it's a
nickname that stuck.

39:38.624 --> 39:42.059
You yell Joe and I barely
even turn around anymore.

39:42.061 --> 39:43.260
Fair enough.

39:43.262 --> 39:45.129
I'm Donna, I believe
you've met my son Jimmy.

39:45.131 --> 39:46.698
Yep.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.032
And this here is...

39:48.034 --> 39:49.267
Cam.

39:49.269 --> 39:50.100
Good to meet ya.

39:50.102 --> 39:52.769
Oh, likewise, sure.

39:52.771 --> 39:55.907
Oh, the boy there, uh,
what'd you say his name was?

39:55.909 --> 39:56.740
Jimmy.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.242
Jimmy, yeah.

39:58.244 --> 40:00.345
Jimmy said that, uh, there
might be space for me here.

40:00.347 --> 40:02.312
Uh yeah, yeah.

40:02.314 --> 40:03.948
You're leaving, right?

40:03.950 --> 40:07.385
Well, you know, on
second thought maybe, uh,

40:07.387 --> 40:09.954
maybe I'll spend another night.

40:09.956 --> 40:11.388
All right.

40:11.390 --> 40:14.091
Could you excuse
us, just a second?

40:14.093 --> 40:17.061
Um, do you wanna bring your
stuff upstairs into my room?

40:17.063 --> 40:18.963
- Yeah.
- All right.

40:18.965 --> 40:19.967
That's wonderful.

40:22.135 --> 40:24.267
No, you got a knack
for cookin' darling.

40:24.269 --> 40:25.336
You really, you do.

40:25.338 --> 40:26.840
Oh thank you.

40:28.340 --> 40:29.309
You're not hungry?

40:30.677 --> 40:32.109
I strongly recommend it.

40:32.111 --> 40:33.280
I'm okay, thank you.

40:36.883 --> 40:39.216
You got a nice place here.

40:39.218 --> 40:40.852
It's home.

40:40.854 --> 40:41.689
Oh, it's nice.

40:42.856 --> 40:45.092
You ever think about
putting in new flooring?

40:46.191 --> 40:47.325
No.

40:47.327 --> 40:50.128
Oh, you
should keep it in mind.

40:50.130 --> 40:53.330
People don't realize what
floors do for a place.

40:53.332 --> 40:55.133
You put in a new
flooring and suddenly

40:55.135 --> 40:56.937
it's like a new house again.

40:57.871 --> 40:58.771
You agree, Cam?

40:59.738 --> 41:01.675
Oh, I never
gave it much thought.

41:02.742 --> 41:04.908
I'm sure most people don't.

41:04.910 --> 41:08.278
I'm in flooring so
it's how my mind works.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.347
You know, I walk into a house,

41:09.349 --> 41:11.849
first thing I notice
is the floors.

41:11.851 --> 41:15.820
Now, laminate flooring,
it's easy, it's cheap,

41:15.822 --> 41:18.691
you can put it right down on
whatever you got right now.

41:19.858 --> 41:22.061
If you don't mind being
about an inch taller.

41:23.195 --> 41:25.064
You pull the base
shoe, the baseboards,

41:26.265 --> 41:28.836
you can put it right down
on this kitchen floor.

41:30.235 --> 41:33.773
Of course you gotta remember
to wipe up spills quick.

41:34.740 --> 41:35.972
That's important, see,

41:35.974 --> 41:39.010
'cause it's susceptible
to moisture damage.

41:39.012 --> 41:41.081
You get that right
away or it'll mold.

41:42.247 --> 41:43.050
So.

41:47.052 --> 41:50.021
Well, I um, I should get to bed.

41:50.023 --> 41:51.388
Long day of traveling
ahead of me.

41:51.390 --> 41:52.823
Oh, of course.

41:52.825 --> 41:54.425
Um, it should be
all made up for you,

41:54.427 --> 41:56.827
and if you need anything,
anything at all.

41:56.829 --> 41:58.431
Oh, I doubt it.

42:04.336 --> 42:07.240
Hey, what's the
matter with you?

42:08.240 --> 42:09.073
Huh?

42:09.075 --> 42:10.475
Oh, hey, I'm just tired.

42:10.477 --> 42:12.680
Not too tired, I hope.

42:24.356 --> 42:25.391
Hey.

42:26.925 --> 42:28.325
You sure you're all right?

42:28.327 --> 42:31.062
Yeah, I'm just, I
don't know, I'm just,

42:31.064 --> 42:33.967
um, you think maybe we
could call it a night?

42:35.367 --> 42:37.003
Yeah, no prob.

42:39.338 --> 42:41.104
Goodnight.

42:41.106 --> 42:41.941
I'm sorry.

43:37.363 --> 43:38.532
How'd you find me?

43:40.599 --> 43:42.399
What's the
first thing a man wants

43:42.401 --> 43:45.336
after 20 years of abstinence?

43:45.338 --> 43:47.604
Don't gotta be Sherlock
Holmes to figure that out.

43:47.606 --> 43:48.972
She ain't a whore.

43:48.974 --> 43:49.974
Oh?

43:49.976 --> 43:51.175
Coulda fooled me.

43:51.177 --> 43:52.609
Anyways, I was gonna call you.

43:52.611 --> 43:54.010
- Sure.
- It was the first thing

43:54.012 --> 43:55.379
I was going to do
when I left here.

43:55.381 --> 43:58.115
Sure, in a week
or two Thursdays.

43:58.117 --> 43:59.550
I shoulda known.

43:59.552 --> 44:03.254
Shoulda waited instead of
traveling all this way.

44:07.559 --> 44:09.496
I won't tolerate any
trouble in my home.

44:10.496 --> 44:11.963
If that's what you
two are here for,

44:11.965 --> 44:13.865
I think you should leave.

44:13.867 --> 44:15.867
Oh, no trouble.

44:15.869 --> 44:18.903
Cam, is there gonna
be any trouble?

44:18.905 --> 44:20.006
I don't think so.

44:21.640 --> 44:22.439
See?

44:22.441 --> 44:24.108
Uh uh.

44:24.110 --> 44:25.343
Something's going on here,

44:25.345 --> 44:26.611
I don't even wanna
know what it is.

44:26.613 --> 44:28.479
I think you should
leave right now.

44:28.481 --> 44:30.580
- Okay.
- Sit down.

44:30.582 --> 44:33.316
Look, let's take
it outside, okay?

44:33.318 --> 44:36.486
I'm not sure where you're
headed but there's a bus

44:36.488 --> 44:37.588
that could take
us right through...

44:37.590 --> 44:39.490
Sit down.

44:53.472 --> 44:56.439
We got a lotta catching
up to do, me and him.

44:56.441 --> 44:58.344
So how about you
wrestle something up.

44:59.479 --> 45:01.314
I got the appetite
for a midnight snack.

45:02.447 --> 45:04.948
I'll warm up the
leftovers, it's all I got.

45:04.950 --> 45:06.086
I'll take 'em cold.

45:27.606 --> 45:29.008
I need that money.

45:34.247 --> 45:35.148
I don't have it.

45:37.483 --> 45:41.622
You know, I was only gonna
take half, my half, but,

45:45.191 --> 45:47.524
if you keep lying to me I'm
gonna have to take it all.

45:47.526 --> 45:48.561
I ain't lying.

45:49.963 --> 45:51.365
I don't know where it is.

45:55.401 --> 45:59.169
You said that
you hid it and you

45:59.171 --> 46:01.571
was gonna go get it
when you got out.

46:01.573 --> 46:05.111
Now, you've been a free
man for how many days?

46:06.512 --> 46:09.379
You expect me to think that
wasn't the first thing you did?

46:09.381 --> 46:10.217
It was.

46:11.150 --> 46:12.318
It ain't there anymore.

46:13.720 --> 46:17.220
20 years is a long time.

46:17.222 --> 46:18.324
Things change.

46:20.626 --> 46:23.530
And I buried that
money in the woods

46:24.697 --> 46:27.200
and now in that very
spot is a parking lot.

46:30.602 --> 46:31.602
A parking lot?

46:31.604 --> 46:32.439
Yeah.

46:33.506 --> 46:35.271
So either some construction
worker ain't working

46:35.273 --> 46:37.041
construction no
more, or me and you,

46:37.043 --> 46:40.414
we gotta go rent a
jackhammer and find out.

46:41.646 --> 46:46.052
But either way, sitting here
talking in this woman's house,

46:46.785 --> 46:48.454
it ain't gonna do us any good.

46:51.356 --> 46:52.655
A parking lot.

46:52.657 --> 46:54.225
Yeah.

46:54.227 --> 46:56.563
I couldn't believe it myself.

46:57.497 --> 46:58.999
What time is it?

47:00.032 --> 47:01.298
Baby, go back to bed.

47:01.300 --> 47:02.700
But I heard
everyone talking.

47:02.702 --> 47:04.535
Yeah, we're talking.

47:04.537 --> 47:06.704
Please go up to your
room and shut the door.

47:06.706 --> 47:08.175
We're all headed to bed soon.

47:20.086 --> 47:25.055
You know, I ain't
good at much aside from

47:25.057 --> 47:27.660
flooring which just
about anybody can do.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.495
I'll admit, I was
usually the one wearing

47:31.497 --> 47:33.664
the dunce cap at school.

47:33.666 --> 47:36.533
It's not that I'm not smart,

47:36.535 --> 47:38.635
it's that I'm a
different kind of smart.

47:38.637 --> 47:43.642
Now, now the way I'm smart is
I have a bullshit detector.

47:45.110 --> 47:47.477
It's probably better than
anyone's bullshit detector

47:47.479 --> 47:49.245
in the whole world.

47:49.247 --> 47:54.253
And right now I'm tellin'
ya, alarm bells are ringin'.

47:55.854 --> 47:58.425
'Cause there's so much
bullshit in this room

47:59.691 --> 48:03.295
that I feel like somebody's
rubbed it into my mustache.

48:05.131 --> 48:06.633
I'll tell ya what I think.

48:08.401 --> 48:11.204
I'll tell you what I think
and you tell me if I'm wrong.

48:12.805 --> 48:17.811
I think that you two are
smitten with each other.

48:19.244 --> 48:22.146
I noticed it as soon as
I walked into this house.

48:22.148 --> 48:25.682
You're shacking up,
hitting the hay.

48:25.684 --> 48:28.586
You have fallen for one another

48:28.588 --> 48:30.791
and now you're gonna make
off with all my money.

48:32.457 --> 48:37.463
Now, if I don't have the
best bullshit detector

48:38.331 --> 48:40.467
in the whole world, tell me.

48:42.568 --> 48:43.834
I hate to break it to ya.

48:43.836 --> 48:44.738
What money?

48:49.474 --> 48:50.309
What money?

48:51.376 --> 48:52.579
She's better than you.

48:54.213 --> 48:57.680
I still smell bullshit, but
you're the better actor.

48:57.682 --> 48:58.617
What money?

49:03.689 --> 49:04.825
You got a cigarette?

49:07.860 --> 49:10.564
It's not one of those
mini things, is it?

49:13.832 --> 49:15.168
Thank you, dear.

49:36.521 --> 49:37.756
What's up, Doc?

49:43.796 --> 49:44.762
There you go.

49:44.764 --> 49:46.629
Here, here you go, yeah.

49:46.631 --> 49:48.735
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

49:50.635 --> 49:51.737
There you go.

49:55.207 --> 49:56.142
What money?

50:01.479 --> 50:02.812
Just stop!

50:02.814 --> 50:04.847
What money, huh?

50:04.849 --> 50:06.883
No, no, please.

50:06.885 --> 50:08.651
What money, huh?

50:08.653 --> 50:10.954
What fucking money, yeah, yeah?

50:10.956 --> 50:12.622
You don't know, yeah?

50:12.624 --> 50:16.794
I swear I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

50:16.796 --> 50:17.729
No, I swear, I swear,

50:17.731 --> 50:19.363
I don't know what
you're talking about.

50:19.365 --> 50:20.934
I have the money!

50:23.869 --> 50:24.738
I thought so.

50:25.838 --> 50:26.872
Upstairs?

50:28.573 --> 50:29.907
Yeah.

50:29.909 --> 50:30.744
All of it?

50:31.776 --> 50:33.010
Yeah.

50:33.012 --> 50:33.813
Okay.

50:35.014 --> 50:35.814
Go get it.

50:47.727 --> 50:49.362
I'm sorry about your pet.

50:50.496 --> 50:53.967
I actually like animals
believe it or not.

50:55.300 --> 50:57.836
I just, I just like money more.

51:21.459 --> 51:23.894
Like the perfume
of an old flame.

51:23.896 --> 51:25.265
It's all there, count it.

51:26.398 --> 51:28.767
Nah, bullshit
detector, remember?

51:29.869 --> 51:31.068
That was all the money I had,

51:31.070 --> 51:32.602
I'm afraid I can't
pay you for my stay.

51:32.604 --> 51:33.903
You know what?

51:33.905 --> 51:36.008
Fuck off, both of you.

51:41.314 --> 51:44.847
Now that I thought this
was the honeymoon phase.

51:44.849 --> 51:47.050
Hey, did you hurt Spiderman?

51:47.052 --> 51:47.986
- Jesus Christ.
- Jimmy.

51:47.988 --> 51:49.653
Baby, put that down,
that's not a toy.

51:49.655 --> 51:51.021
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Now, listen, listen,

51:51.023 --> 51:53.557
- Just let him go.
- I know you got rice pudding

51:53.559 --> 51:54.992
where your brains
are supposed to be,

51:54.994 --> 51:57.827
but this is stupid
even for you, son.

51:57.829 --> 52:00.030
- You hurt Spiderman!
- You know how to use

52:00.032 --> 52:01.765
that thing, kid?

52:01.767 --> 52:04.934
'Cause if you shoot me and you
don't kill me, I'm gonna snap

52:04.936 --> 52:06.769
- that little fucker's legs.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

52:06.771 --> 52:08.671
- All four of 'em.
- He's just a kid,

52:08.673 --> 52:09.872
- he don't know better.
- Yeah, yeah,

52:09.874 --> 52:11.675
then you're gonna have to
watch your little bunny wabbit

52:11.677 --> 52:14.477
- wiggling around on the ground.
- Hey, just go!

52:14.479 --> 52:16.680
You're a, you're a bad man.

52:16.682 --> 52:18.582
You know how to
shoot to kill, Jimmy?

52:18.584 --> 52:19.916
Come on, I dare ya.

52:19.918 --> 52:21.952
- Jimmy, we don't shoot.
- It's a free shot!

52:21.954 --> 52:23.019
Your mother is speaking

52:23.021 --> 52:23.921
- to you, god damnit!
- I'm gonna fix the rabbit,

52:23.923 --> 52:25.756
- the rabbit's fine.
- Come on, come on.

52:25.758 --> 52:26.691
He's not hurt.

52:26.693 --> 52:27.925
Get the
fuck away from my son!

52:27.927 --> 52:28.961
Donna!

52:36.501 --> 52:39.736
Oh, no, oh, no.

52:39.738 --> 52:41.073
What did you do?

52:43.441 --> 52:44.073
It's okay, baby.

52:44.075 --> 52:45.776
No.

52:45.778 --> 52:47.414
No, what did you do?

52:48.613 --> 52:50.381
- Mom.
- It's okay, sweetheart.

52:50.383 --> 52:51.849
Did you do?

52:51.851 --> 52:53.986
- Donna!
- You're okay, baby.

52:55.086 --> 52:56.687
Who is that?

52:56.689 --> 52:58.055
Who?

52:58.057 --> 53:00.023
What the fuck did you
bring into my house?

53:00.025 --> 53:01.492
Well, I didn't
think you were gonna...

53:01.494 --> 53:02.725
You didn't think what?

53:02.727 --> 53:04.093
That one of those people
you were runnin' from

53:04.095 --> 53:05.028
would find you here?

53:05.030 --> 53:07.930
Or that my son would
find your gun, huh?

53:07.932 --> 53:09.399
I shoulda kept going.

53:09.401 --> 53:11.135
I liked you too
much, I shouldn't of,

53:11.137 --> 53:12.503
I shouldn't of
stayed another night.

53:12.505 --> 53:14.437
Oh, so I'm supposed
to be flattered?

53:14.439 --> 53:15.939
I'm fucking flattered now?

53:15.941 --> 53:17.441
- No!
- Mama.

53:17.443 --> 53:20.077
Honey, he was a bad man.

53:20.079 --> 53:22.079
He was so bad.

53:22.081 --> 53:23.146
But he wasn't
gonna hurt nobody,

53:23.148 --> 53:24.881
he just wanted the money.

53:24.883 --> 53:25.783
He ain't a killer!

53:25.785 --> 53:27.417
Well, then he
picked the wrong house

53:27.419 --> 53:28.787
to find it in, 'cause I am.

53:33.057 --> 53:34.892
When it's deep enough
we'll go in and grab in.

53:34.894 --> 53:38.629
No, maybe, maybe we should
call the police instead.

53:38.631 --> 53:41.564
I will kill you before you
go and do a thing like that.

53:41.566 --> 53:43.666
Look who's true
colors come out.

53:43.668 --> 53:45.104
Look, it ain't personal.

53:46.070 --> 53:48.070
I need to protect my
son and I can't do

53:48.072 --> 53:49.338
that if I'm in jail, can I?

53:49.340 --> 53:52.742
Maybe I'll, I'll say it's my
fault, I'll say I killed him.

53:52.744 --> 53:54.211
It don't matter.

53:54.213 --> 53:55.912
I'm involved.

53:55.914 --> 53:58.617
As soon as they find out who
I am they'll put me away, too.

54:00.985 --> 54:02.452
Look, this ain't the
first man I've killed

54:02.454 --> 54:05.021
and I don't feel
about either of 'em.

54:05.023 --> 54:06.957
I'm not sure if that makes
me a bad person or what,

54:06.959 --> 54:08.191
but I don't, and I
don't wanna spend

54:08.193 --> 54:09.928
any more time talking about it.

54:11.130 --> 54:13.532
I got a boy in there who
needs me, I'm all he's got.

54:14.633 --> 54:17.133
You got anyone who
needs you for anything?

54:17.135 --> 54:17.968
No, I don't.

54:17.970 --> 54:19.236
All right, well
you got one now.

54:19.238 --> 54:21.107
It's me and I need you to dig.

54:39.023 --> 54:42.024
That guy you killed, the
one you went to prison for,

54:42.026 --> 54:43.496
what was that all about?

54:44.662 --> 54:48.434
You know, I was in and
outta juvie my whole childhood

54:49.635 --> 54:51.037
and when I got older, jail.

54:53.137 --> 54:56.875
When I got out the last time
I worked flooring for houses

54:58.010 --> 55:00.209
and it was one of those
rehabilitation jobs

55:00.211 --> 55:01.812
they give you to walk
the straight and narrow

55:01.814 --> 55:02.745
but I wasn't making any money

55:02.747 --> 55:05.217
it was community service hours.

55:07.086 --> 55:09.122
Then one day when
I was on the job

55:12.525 --> 55:13.425
I found that suitcase.

55:16.160 --> 55:20.097
For the first time in
my life I felt

55:20.099 --> 55:21.066
like I had options.

55:22.668 --> 55:27.173
I felt ambition I didn't
know I had and it was nice.

55:28.006 --> 55:29.575
I figured I'd start
a business of my own.

55:31.977 --> 55:35.081
I shoulda known better
but I told the boss,

55:36.282 --> 55:39.550
he was my employer at
the time and I figured

55:39.552 --> 55:40.983
I knew nothing about businesses,

55:40.985 --> 55:42.588
he already was the owner of one.

55:43.956 --> 55:45.158
Well, he was more
than interested.

55:46.592 --> 55:49.963
That is until the
owners of the suitcase

55:50.863 --> 55:52.065
noticed it was gone.

55:53.298 --> 55:56.802
They went straight to him, he
pointed them straight to me.

55:58.202 --> 56:01.106
One of them broke into my house
in the middle of the night.

56:02.874 --> 56:04.106
I guess he wasn't
expecting me to have

56:04.108 --> 56:05.811
a gun on my bedside table.

56:06.912 --> 56:08.245
You shot him.

56:08.247 --> 56:09.082
Yep.

56:11.015 --> 56:16.021
Then I took off, stashed it,
came here, turned myself in.

56:17.189 --> 56:21.158
'Cause I knew the boss or
somebody else will come after me

56:21.160 --> 56:23.894
once they realized
the suitcase was gone.

56:23.896 --> 56:25.198
Money never goes unmissed.

56:27.633 --> 56:28.568
So I stayed safe.

56:29.735 --> 56:31.734
Close to 20 years locked up.

56:31.736 --> 56:33.169
Rolled the dice
on whether the bag

56:33.171 --> 56:34.606
would be here when I got out.

56:35.374 --> 56:36.773
You stashed it.

56:36.775 --> 56:40.142
In your room
before it was your room.

56:41.747 --> 56:44.183
I knew you didn't
walk in with a case.

56:51.055 --> 56:54.191
You know, um, I was
planning on leaving

56:54.193 --> 56:55.392
you some of it anyway, you know,

56:55.394 --> 57:00.099
for taking care of it for me
even though you didn't know.

57:01.332 --> 57:02.168
Thanks.

57:03.702 --> 57:06.202
You know, now that we're
in the thick of this,

57:06.204 --> 57:08.240
I wouldn't mind
splitting it with ya.

57:11.276 --> 57:15.214
You know, I dunno, maybe we
could, maybe we share it.

57:18.182 --> 57:19.585
Ain't that the same thing?

57:21.019 --> 57:21.820
No.

57:22.988 --> 57:23.856
No, it's different.

57:26.325 --> 57:28.294
Donna, last night
was something for me.

57:29.727 --> 57:32.963
Hell, I'm sorry it had to
be followed by all this mess

57:32.965 --> 57:34.196
but that don't
change the fact that

57:34.198 --> 57:36.336
it was special to me,
it was real special.

57:38.871 --> 57:40.305
I've grown sweet on you.

57:42.907 --> 57:44.343
All you gotta do
is say the word.

57:45.711 --> 57:50.146
Now just one thing
at a time, all right?

57:50.148 --> 57:52.182
I'm not saying no, I just...

57:52.184 --> 57:53.653
I understand, I understand.

57:57.456 --> 57:58.291
What about you?

57:59.425 --> 58:01.394
When you killed,
what happened there?

58:03.195 --> 58:03.997
It was my dad.

58:06.197 --> 58:08.298
Oh.

58:08.300 --> 58:10.102
Yeah, I was 18.

58:11.369 --> 58:15.405
I knew I'd be tried as an
adult so I jumped on a bus

58:15.407 --> 58:19.175
and tried to find the smallest
podunk town I could find.

58:19.177 --> 58:20.112
Changed my name.

58:22.314 --> 58:23.216
Why'd you do it?

58:25.950 --> 58:28.320
One night I decided
enough was enough.

58:45.236 --> 58:47.840
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

58:50.309 --> 58:51.742
He couldn't of gone far.

58:51.744 --> 58:53.343
Well he's had
hours to get away,

58:53.345 --> 58:54.910
he could be at the
fucking police station.

58:54.912 --> 58:56.979
He's got a hole in his
neck, he probably bled out.

58:56.981 --> 58:58.817
Well, that's not a
chance I'm willing to take.

59:04.222 --> 59:05.056
There.

59:21.939 --> 59:23.974
Oh god.

59:23.976 --> 59:25.508
Cameron, put
your hand on his neck,

59:25.510 --> 59:28.445
he's still breathing
through his damn throat.

59:34.285 --> 59:35.354
Okay.

59:58.209 --> 59:59.276
Oh shit.

59:59.278 --> 01:00:00.910
- Shit, is that?
- Oh shit!

01:00:00.912 --> 01:00:02.144
All right, come on.

01:00:02.146 --> 01:00:03.345
Help me get him to
the house quick.

01:00:10.822 --> 01:00:11.456
Shit!

01:00:19.997 --> 01:00:23.432
♪ I'm filled with dreams
they pass me back ♪

01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:25.836
♪ Until spring they're
only pictures ♪

01:00:25.838 --> 01:00:29.405
♪ Left hanging in
my frame of mind ♪

01:00:31.476 --> 01:00:34.376
Oh god, all right.

01:00:34.378 --> 01:00:35.380
Oh god.

01:00:43.988 --> 01:00:47.059
All right, just let me do the
talking, you go by the hall.

01:00:52.296 --> 01:00:53.963
Is that blood, jeez,
Donna, are you okay?

01:00:53.965 --> 01:00:54.865
Oh, I'm fine.

01:00:54.867 --> 01:00:55.631
Well, what in
God's name happened...

01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:56.566
It's not mine.

01:00:56.568 --> 01:00:57.537
Oh, you won't even believe it.

01:01:00.472 --> 01:01:02.238
Well try me.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.410
Damn bunny rabbit escaped
and got killed by a coyote.

01:01:07.044 --> 01:01:08.644
- Spiderman?
- Yeah.

01:01:08.646 --> 01:01:12.582
So we heard a
commotion, ran outside,

01:01:12.584 --> 01:01:14.550
coyote dropped the bunny rabbit

01:01:14.552 --> 01:01:16.119
and now we gotta
bury the poor thing.

01:01:16.121 --> 01:01:17.456
And Jimmy, he's a wreck.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.425
He's still here, huh?

01:01:23.427 --> 01:01:25.397
Yeah, he's
leaving tonight.

01:01:27.398 --> 01:01:28.233
Yeah.

01:01:30.168 --> 01:01:31.267
He pay you yet.

01:01:32.104 --> 01:01:32.939
Ah, good.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.475
It's a pretty big hole
for a little bunny rabbit.

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:40.577
Yeah, it is.

01:01:40.579 --> 01:01:44.280
Jimmy wanted me to
bury him with his cage.

01:01:44.282 --> 01:01:47.085
You know, that way
he has his home and.

01:01:48.153 --> 01:01:48.955
Right.

01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:52.457
I can see why he'd
find that important.

01:01:54.492 --> 01:01:58.197
Yeah, why don't I go
and grab your money?

01:02:00.698 --> 01:02:01.601
Thank you, Dona.

01:02:10.943 --> 01:02:11.577
Coyote, huh?

01:02:13.211 --> 01:02:14.544
What?

01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:16.546
Oh, yeah.

01:02:16.548 --> 01:02:17.582
Yeah.

01:02:19.651 --> 01:02:21.584
Must've given him
quite a scare in order

01:02:21.586 --> 01:02:23.452
for him to drop his dinner.

01:02:23.454 --> 01:02:25.657
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I guess.

01:02:27.191 --> 01:02:28.193
Lotta blood.

01:02:29.628 --> 01:02:32.899
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna
have to wash everything.

01:02:34.465 --> 01:02:37.269
How was, how was your night?

01:02:39.003 --> 01:02:42.539
You must think I got this
badge out of a Cracker Jack box.

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.006
Excuse me?

01:02:44.008 --> 01:02:45.677
I'm gonna give
you two options.

01:02:47.178 --> 01:02:49.611
Either you tell me what the
hell is going on around here

01:02:49.613 --> 01:02:51.580
or I put you in cuffs and
I take you to the station.

01:02:51.582 --> 01:02:53.749
Either way, I'm gonna find out.

01:02:53.751 --> 01:02:55.053
So the choice is yours.

01:02:56.655 --> 01:03:01.394
I know what I would
pick, but that's just me.

01:03:03.628 --> 01:03:04.664
All right.

01:03:06.731 --> 01:03:07.565
I'll tell you.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.103
How would you like to
walk outta here cash rich?

01:03:14.039 --> 01:03:14.674
I'm listening.

01:03:17.075 --> 01:03:18.341
- Jimmy!
- Spiderman?

01:03:18.343 --> 01:03:20.142
Yeah, honey,
I need you to put him

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:21.144
in your room, okay?

01:03:21.146 --> 01:03:22.379
Do you
think he's hurt?

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:24.079
Yeah, but I need
your help, okay?

01:03:24.081 --> 01:03:25.148
Come on, hurry up.

01:03:31.689 --> 01:03:33.655
And what about this boss,

01:03:33.657 --> 01:03:35.557
we just dump him in the
hole and that's that?

01:03:35.559 --> 01:03:38.193
Nobody knows he came here and
gonna come looking for him?

01:03:38.195 --> 01:03:39.028
No.

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.599
No, he's a solitary guy.

01:03:41.733 --> 01:03:44.267
I mean, he's got his
business but nobody's gonna.

01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:47.037
They're not gonna know
he came down here.

01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:49.642
People go missing all the time.

01:03:52.677 --> 01:03:55.345
Yeah, they do, don't they?

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:56.582
- I think so.
- Yeah.

01:04:04.155 --> 01:04:08.994
Well, I guess the big fat
elephant in the room is Donna.

01:04:12.564 --> 01:04:14.100
What about her?

01:04:15.767 --> 01:04:17.466
Well, I don't know about you,

01:04:17.468 --> 01:04:19.204
but I sure as hell don't
wanna split it three ways.

01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:23.673
I mean, it's not like she
ain't gonna spill the beans

01:04:23.675 --> 01:04:25.774
with her past and
all but she just...

01:04:25.776 --> 01:04:27.676
You don't trust her?

01:04:27.678 --> 01:04:30.715
Uh, yeah, sure, about
as far as I can throw her.

01:04:33.184 --> 01:04:34.719
Don't fall for her looks.

01:04:36.787 --> 01:04:39.758
It's just best not to give her
the opportunity, that's all.

01:04:41.258 --> 01:04:42.093
Okay.

01:04:44.361 --> 01:04:45.363
Okay what?

01:04:47.765 --> 01:04:49.668
Okay, let's not give
her the opportunity.

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:52.635
Honey.

01:04:52.637 --> 01:04:53.635
Honey, look at me.

01:04:53.637 --> 01:04:54.672
Look at me.

01:04:55.807 --> 01:04:57.707
This is very important, okay?

01:04:57.709 --> 01:05:00.109
We need to get out of here,
we're gonna take a trip.

01:05:00.111 --> 01:05:01.176
To the store?

01:05:01.178 --> 01:05:02.812
No, baby, not to the store.

01:05:02.814 --> 01:05:04.513
To a new home.

01:05:04.515 --> 01:05:06.751
Someplace nicer, someplace a
whole lot different than here.

01:05:09.287 --> 01:05:10.720
But why?

01:05:10.722 --> 01:05:13.155
Because we can't
stay here anymore.

01:05:13.157 --> 01:05:15.225
Look, I'm gonna ask you to
do the most important thing

01:05:15.227 --> 01:05:16.425
I've ever asked of you.

01:05:16.427 --> 01:05:18.561
I don't are if you never
make the beds again

01:05:18.563 --> 01:05:21.164
or if the fridge stays
empty, it doesn't matter.

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:23.803
This is the only thing
I need you to do, okay?

01:05:26.872 --> 01:05:29.171
Take this towel
and soap and scrub

01:05:29.173 --> 01:05:30.773
this out as fast as you can.

01:05:30.775 --> 01:05:32.742
Can I trust you to do that?

01:05:32.744 --> 01:05:34.646
Yeah, I can do that.

01:05:44.588 --> 01:05:45.423
Donna.

01:05:48.226 --> 01:05:50.229
What have you done, huh?

01:05:58.702 --> 01:06:02.405
You got the kid.

01:06:02.407 --> 01:06:04.142
You got the kid
doing the cleaning?

01:06:04.843 --> 01:06:05.874
Oh my god.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.550
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:13.850
That kills me!

01:06:13.852 --> 01:06:15.718
That kills me.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.352
Oh my god.

01:06:17.354 --> 01:06:18.687
Here.

01:06:18.689 --> 01:06:19.525
Oh god.

01:06:20.425 --> 01:06:21.293
I needed that.

01:06:23.427 --> 01:06:24.660
Sorry, mama.

01:06:24.662 --> 01:06:26.963
No, baby, it's okay,
you did a great job.

01:06:26.965 --> 01:06:27.800
God.

01:06:31.436 --> 01:06:35.504
I had a background check
done on your boytoy out there.

01:06:35.506 --> 01:06:38.878
Holy cow are you two a
match made in heaven, hmm?

01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:42.547
One piece of advice.

01:06:43.715 --> 01:06:46.249
Run your info by one
another before you try

01:06:46.251 --> 01:06:47.785
to spin a tall tale.

01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:53.256
He didn't know nothing about
the rabbit and the coyote.

01:06:53.258 --> 01:06:54.560
Where's the rabbit?

01:06:55.593 --> 01:06:57.859
Where's the coyote, Donna?

01:06:57.861 --> 01:06:58.898
Hello!

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.633
It didn't take me long to
get the rest out of him.

01:07:04.635 --> 01:07:05.871
Rest of what?

01:07:07.405 --> 01:07:08.937
- Zane!
- You're dumb enough

01:07:08.939 --> 01:07:10.242
as it is, sweetheart.

01:07:10.874 --> 01:07:12.277
You ain't gonna play it.

01:07:15.512 --> 01:07:16.881
Show me where this Boss is.

01:07:19.818 --> 01:07:20.983
Wow.

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:25.254
Couldn't help yourself, huh?

01:07:25.256 --> 01:07:27.490
Killer instinct
got the best of ya?

01:07:27.492 --> 01:07:28.825
Yeah, something like that.

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:29.828
Yeah.

01:07:30.794 --> 01:07:33.396
Well your boy toy told
me all about the money.

01:07:33.398 --> 01:07:36.966
In fact, he said he'd split
it with me if I let him go.

01:07:36.968 --> 01:07:38.468
Got rid of you.

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:39.635
I don't believe that.

01:07:39.637 --> 01:07:41.437
Believe it, sister.

01:07:41.439 --> 01:07:42.638
He woulda cut you
out of the picture

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.439
the first chance he got.

01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:45.975
Yep.

01:07:45.977 --> 01:07:48.711
You should feel pretty lucky
I came around when I did.

01:07:48.713 --> 01:07:49.544
Where is he now?

01:07:49.546 --> 01:07:51.314
He's in my car.

01:07:51.316 --> 01:07:52.818
Front seat or back?

01:07:53.952 --> 01:07:54.852
The back.

01:07:57.956 --> 01:07:59.892
So you weren't tempted
to take that deal?

01:08:00.825 --> 01:08:01.827
No, of course not.

01:08:02.994 --> 01:08:04.662
I got certain allegiances.

01:08:06.898 --> 01:08:09.735
What if I told you I was
prepared to sweeten that deal?

01:08:10.735 --> 01:08:11.901
Give it all to you if you forget

01:08:11.903 --> 01:08:13.606
the whole thing ever happened?

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:16.939
The cash?

01:08:16.941 --> 01:08:17.977
Yeah.

01:08:18.942 --> 01:08:20.609
Let me bury the
body and you never

01:08:20.612 --> 01:08:22.979
bring it up again,
it's all yours.

01:08:22.981 --> 01:08:25.913
I don't know how much is in
there, but it's not a little,

01:08:25.916 --> 01:08:27.917
and it sure beats you
coming by here to nickel

01:08:27.919 --> 01:08:30.086
and dime me every time I
get a goddamn customer.

01:08:30.087 --> 01:08:31.953
Well, look bitch,
there's no world in where

01:08:31.955 --> 01:08:34.590
I leave here tonight
without that money.

01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:35.957
Even if I have to get rid of Cam

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.926
- or you for that matter!
- Zane!

01:08:37.929 --> 01:08:41.029
Well, the worst will be
two less fucking killers!

01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:43.533
The only thing you stand
to gain in this negotiation

01:08:43.535 --> 01:08:47.639
is your life and not a damned
thing more, you understand?

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.742
You understand?

01:08:52.443 --> 01:08:53.278
Good!

01:08:56.548 --> 01:08:58.716
You'd pour me a glass
of milk, I'm parched.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:10.028
Well, you were right,
it ain't a little.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:13.965
Let me ask you something.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.703
If I do what you said,
I look the other way.

01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:19.968
Do I gotta worry about
the retard spilling

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:21.404
his guts to the next passerby?

01:09:21.406 --> 01:09:23.638
Look, don't call
him that, all right?

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.742
Jimmy does what
I tell him to do.

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:27.412
You don't gotta
worry about that.

01:09:28.612 --> 01:09:29.845
Well, here's my other idea.

01:09:29.848 --> 01:09:32.013
And don't get mad until
you hear me out, okay?

01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:34.917
My other idea is
we light a match

01:09:34.919 --> 01:09:36.921
and burn this place
to the ground.

01:09:38.923 --> 01:09:40.425
Why would you wanna do that?

01:09:41.459 --> 01:09:42.728
Insurance, duh.

01:09:43.928 --> 01:09:46.631
Plus it's a nice clean
way to explain the bodies.

01:09:47.732 --> 01:09:49.430
Bodies?

01:09:49.433 --> 01:09:50.702
As in more than one?

01:09:51.635 --> 01:09:53.037
Yeah, boss man and Cam.

01:09:54.571 --> 01:09:56.441
You don't gotta
kill Cam, Zane.

01:09:57.776 --> 01:09:58.610
Oh, sure I do.

01:10:00.612 --> 01:10:01.447
Sure I do.

01:10:04.148 --> 01:10:05.882
This is how I see it.

01:10:05.884 --> 01:10:08.918
Someone falls asleep drunk,
cigarette lit, blinds catch.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.955
It's a fireworks show.

01:10:10.921 --> 01:10:12.821
And since this place is
registered in my name

01:10:12.823 --> 01:10:14.657
you ain't gotta worry about
anyone finding out who you are.

01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:17.963
We both get cash,
we find a new place,

01:10:19.763 --> 01:10:23.067
and I make off with my
fortune somewhere tropical.

01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:28.136
Tired of this town anyhow.

01:10:28.138 --> 01:10:30.972
The lord took my mom
tonight, God rest her soul.

01:10:30.974 --> 01:10:32.475
Sorry to hear that.

01:10:32.477 --> 01:10:33.112
Thank you.

01:10:39.049 --> 01:10:40.686
You really like this doofus Cam?

01:10:45.924 --> 01:10:47.222
I do.

01:10:47.224 --> 01:10:48.026
I did.

01:10:49.193 --> 01:10:49.995
I don't know.

01:10:54.031 --> 01:10:55.032
Why?

01:10:55.933 --> 01:10:57.001
He was kind to me.

01:10:59.504 --> 01:11:01.604
And he might be Jimmy's father.

01:11:01.606 --> 01:11:02.441
Really?

01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:06.044
Well the plot thickens.

01:11:07.545 --> 01:11:08.711
How can you be sure?

01:11:08.713 --> 01:11:10.178
- I can't.
- I mean, there was a time

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.181
when you first moved
here, put a blindfold on,

01:11:12.183 --> 01:11:14.249
spun you around,
whoever you landed on

01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:15.751
woulda had just a
good a chance of being

01:11:15.753 --> 01:11:16.985
the father as the next.

01:11:16.987 --> 01:11:18.154
All right, Zane,
you made your point.

01:11:18.156 --> 01:11:20.859
I even thought, I
thought I might be.

01:11:24.762 --> 01:11:27.064
And what difference would
that make if you were?

01:11:28.665 --> 01:11:31.436
Tell you the truth, I never
gave it that much thought.

01:11:32.103 --> 01:11:33.703
Neither here nor there, really.

01:11:33.705 --> 01:11:35.136
I guess not.

01:11:35.138 --> 01:11:36.207
Yep, I guess not.

01:11:46.116 --> 01:11:48.085
Let me just ask you,
'cause I'll wonder.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.193
If I was, would that mean
we have a chance you and me?

01:11:56.628 --> 01:11:58.063
If you were Jimmy's father?

01:12:00.231 --> 01:12:01.066
Yeah.

01:12:05.003 --> 01:12:06.671
You'd have to
be there for him.

01:12:08.272 --> 01:12:10.141
You'd have to be there for us.

01:12:11.108 --> 01:12:12.807
I know.

01:12:12.809 --> 01:12:15.481
You can't just come by
looking for a place to put it.

01:12:17.048 --> 01:12:19.080
Is that really
what you think of me?

01:12:19.082 --> 01:12:21.152
And you gotta
listen when I talk.

01:12:22.719 --> 01:12:24.956
You've gotta respect
what I say when I say it.

01:12:27.258 --> 01:12:28.190
It's a give and
take, relationships,

01:12:28.192 --> 01:12:30.963
you just can't be in
charge all the time.

01:12:32.129 --> 01:12:33.231
I can abide by that.

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:39.571
All right.

01:12:41.004 --> 01:12:42.073
Let's go upstairs.

01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:28.787
You.

01:13:32.723 --> 01:13:37.728
Donna, I'm loving the
smell of you, Donna.

01:13:38.763 --> 01:13:39.831
What is that?

01:13:42.366 --> 01:13:46.368
No!

01:13:53.945 --> 01:13:56.314
You had a take something
nice and ruin it, didn't ya?

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.116
I said I loved you, Donna!

01:14:00.284 --> 01:14:01.820
I said I loved you!

01:14:11.829 --> 01:14:14.299
I shoulda listened to my mother!

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.205
'Cause she always said you
were just a no good whore.

01:14:28.979 --> 01:14:29.814
Son.

01:14:37.688 --> 01:14:38.689
Oh my god.

01:14:53.036 --> 01:14:54.302
Oh my god.

01:14:54.304 --> 01:14:56.271
Do I have to clean it up?

01:14:56.273 --> 01:14:57.108
No, no.

01:14:58.043 --> 01:15:00.342
Look, I need you to
get your stuff together

01:15:00.344 --> 01:15:03.044
and we're gonna get
out of here, okay?

01:15:03.046 --> 01:15:04.379
Okay?

01:15:04.381 --> 01:15:06.351
- To our new home?
- Yeah, baby, to our new home.

01:15:08.352 --> 01:15:10.022

01:15:11.755 --> 01:15:13.288

without Spiderman.

01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:14.425
Oh, sweetheart, we're
gonna bring Spiderman.

01:15:17.428 --> 01:15:19.264

gonna have Spiderman.
