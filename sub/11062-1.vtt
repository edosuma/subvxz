NUTMEG MOVIES
presents

00:06.667 --> 00:10.876
In collaboration with TV2
with support from Danish Film Institute

00:16.542 --> 00:21.126
- Crap weather.
- But the fall colors are beautiful.

00:21.251 --> 00:25.709
Not a damn thing is happening.
No one walks by here.

00:25.834 --> 00:29.334
That's kinda what I like about it.
Peace and quiet.

00:29.459 --> 00:33.459
I wouldn't mind a couple of girls
jogging by.

00:34.626 --> 00:37.501
- Well...
- Let's have a beer.

00:37.626 --> 00:41.209
- Why not grab one now?
- No, I don't have time.

00:41.334 --> 00:45.876
Mia is alone with Fie.
We're struggling with the christening.

00:46.001 --> 00:48.876
The christening?
It's in 2 weeks!

00:49.001 --> 00:52.542
The final details and all that.
Mia's going through the roof.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.167
- You're welcome to stop by.
- Now?

00:55.292 --> 00:57.167
No! In 2 weeks.

02:18.042 --> 02:22.584
Yes...
I'd like to welcome you all.

02:22.709 --> 02:26.126
Thank you for coming
to our christening celebration.

02:26.251 --> 02:29.501
And a special thank you
to our nanny, Tuss.

02:29.626 --> 02:33.376
She and Fie have become great friends.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.001
The delivery was a bit rough.

02:36.084 --> 02:42.584
Malthe weighed in at almost 4.5 kilos.
It took everyone by surprise.

02:42.709 --> 02:46.792
Lars, our dear friend,
has made some lovely food for us.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.459
Yes, temptations of all sorts.
Sausage rolls for the kids -

02:50.584 --> 02:54.709
- and delicacies you can munch on
throughout the day.

02:54.876 --> 02:58.542
- Bueno apetito!
- Cheers, everyone. And welcome.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.626
It's lovely to see you.

03:01.751 --> 03:04.001
Delicious and home-made.

03:04.084 --> 03:08.042
Select produce.
Keeping it simple. Family food.

03:08.167 --> 03:13.001
- Isn't Casper coming?
- No, we didn't invite him.

03:13.126 --> 03:17.917
It's a family affair, and he doesn't
really fit in. Right, Frank?

03:18.042 --> 03:21.667
- Right.
- Hello! Hi!

03:21.792 --> 03:24.834
Hi.
Hi, everyone.

03:25.001 --> 03:29.126
- Congratulations. Mia, take this.
- Long time no see!

03:29.251 --> 03:34.751
Sorry, I skipped the church.
Hope that was okay.

03:34.876 --> 03:39.584
I just want to say:
A wise man once said:

03:39.709 --> 03:45.084
You choose your friends,
you get a family.

03:45.209 --> 03:49.001
Your unity is beautiful.
We just watch it in awe.

03:49.126 --> 03:55.251
I'm single, so I look at it with eyes
that just try to take it all in.

03:55.376 --> 04:00.001
So congratulations on that, and cheers
everyone. I'm sorry I was late.

04:00.126 --> 04:02.376
Cheers!

04:04.084 --> 04:06.626
And congratulations to you!

04:06.751 --> 04:11.292
- I'm not sure what we agreed.
- Well, he's your responsibility.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.001
How old are you?
You're older, I can see that.

04:15.084 --> 04:19.666
- I just turned 21.
- Okay! Perfect.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.584
- Having fun, Bo?
- Definitely.

04:25.709 --> 04:30.167
- Our camping trip was ages ago.
- Yes, it's been a while.

04:30.292 --> 04:35.001
- When was it, anyway?
- Five years ago, Frank.

04:36.167 --> 04:42.126
- Has it really been five years?
- Yes. It's not something one forgets.

04:43.626 --> 04:46.626
- Right... I'd better mingle.
- Yes.

04:46.751 --> 04:52.251
- Dad, I can't find my teddy bear.
- Oh? Let's go look for it.

04:52.376 --> 04:56.626
- Did you have it upstairs, sweetie?
- I don't know.

05:01.501 --> 05:04.709
- What the hell, Frank?
- What are you doing?

05:04.834 --> 05:09.251
- What we're doing? We're talking.
- I want my teddy bear.

05:09.376 --> 05:12.084
- She needs her teddy bear.
- Yes...

05:12.209 --> 05:15.542
You have it in your hand!

05:15.667 --> 05:20.751
- Sweetie, go downstairs.
- There's nothing going on down there.

05:22.501 --> 05:25.667
- That's why she won't sleep with it?
- Honey...

05:25.792 --> 05:28.042
It can be washed.

05:29.001 --> 05:32.459
I don't think it got soiled.

05:32.584 --> 05:36.126
- He just held it to cover it up.
- It smells.

05:36.251 --> 05:42.001
Old teddy bear smell, that's all.
Old crotch smells entirely different.

05:42.084 --> 05:45.584
I'll talk to him tomorrow.
We're meeting at the publisher's.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.917
About the friendship book.

05:54.084 --> 05:56.334
The manuscript is finished.

05:56.459 --> 06:02.709
I read it this weekend, and you
sure get your money's worth here.

06:02.834 --> 06:06.834
- It'll be a great book.
- Listen, boys. I read it.

06:07.001 --> 06:10.334
Let me tell you,
it's world-class!

06:10.459 --> 06:14.792
That book has it all!
It'll be a humongous seller.

06:14.917 --> 06:19.209
It's our retirement plan right there.
The first book from the Golden Boys.

06:19.334 --> 06:23.917
- It'll take off big time.
- I agree with Ulrich.

06:24.042 --> 06:27.709
- There are no guarantees.
- We start out with 100,000 copies.

06:27.834 --> 06:32.126
That depends on the reactions
at the retailers...

06:32.251 --> 06:36.417
I'm in with the big companies.
I've sold the first 75,000 copies.

06:36.542 --> 06:40.376
- Sure. If you can guarantee sales...
- I totally guarantee it.

06:40.501 --> 06:44.834
There are a few details to discuss.
But that's normal procedure.

06:45.001 --> 06:48.084
- We need to read it first.
- What?

06:48.209 --> 06:52.001
That'll have to be quick,
or we won't make it by Christmas.

06:52.126 --> 06:55.792
- I didn't know we had to read it.
- Me neither! I'm never reading it.

06:55.917 --> 06:59.126
- You didn't read it?
- No, and I'm not going to.

06:59.251 --> 07:02.001
Me neither.
I'm so tied up at home.

07:02.126 --> 07:07.042
- Let's have a beer. A quick one?
- No, I have to get home.

07:07.167 --> 07:09.792
- Why?
- Mia's stuck with everything.

07:09.917 --> 07:13.751
- Come on! Have a beer with me!
- We don't have a nanny anymore.

07:13.876 --> 07:18.667
- Who did you think you were boinking?
- 'Boinking'...?

07:18.792 --> 07:21.751
- Intercourse.
- Cousin Andreas's daughter.

07:21.876 --> 07:25.834
Fie's nanny. We had to let her go
when Mia found out.

07:26.001 --> 07:30.792
The redhead? Oh, okay.
There's no way I could've known that!

07:30.917 --> 07:36.126
- Is Mia upset?
- That's putting it mildly! She's livid.

07:36.251 --> 07:39.042
- Have you put on weight?
- Me?

07:39.167 --> 07:45.042
When we first met you were 75 kilos.
Ladies, partying...

07:45.167 --> 07:47.001
And now?

07:47.126 --> 07:51.417
- I can still take you down.
- No, you can't!

07:54.459 --> 07:58.001
- Defend yourself!
- You're waking up Malthe!

07:58.126 --> 08:00.626
God damn it!

08:03.042 --> 08:07.251
He just fell asleep!
There goes the routine. Damn it...

08:07.376 --> 08:09.667
He'll go back to sleep.

08:09.792 --> 08:14.292
The kitchen's a mess! And you don't help
even though you're on paternity leave!

08:14.417 --> 08:18.167
- Sure, I do, honey.
- No, you don't! Look at it!

08:18.292 --> 08:23.209
Casper came to apologize
for the thing with Tuss.

08:23.334 --> 08:27.584
Some other time, Casper. I don't have
time for that now. Can you sense that?

08:27.709 --> 08:32.917
- Yes.
- And no more pictures of your willy!

08:34.126 --> 08:36.626
Do you get it?

08:36.751 --> 08:40.167
What the hell was that?
I never sent anything to Mia.

08:40.292 --> 08:43.708
- She saw my phone...
- You let her check your phone?

08:43.833 --> 08:47.792
- There's nothing she shouldn't see.
- Apparently there is.

08:47.917 --> 08:51.834
Alright, the one picture.

08:52.001 --> 08:56.417
What the hell kind of life
are you making for yourself here?

08:56.542 --> 09:03.042
- What the hell is this?
- Listen, we're a nuclear family...

09:03.167 --> 09:07.334
That comes with some stuff
that isn't always practical.

09:07.459 --> 09:11.251
Well, see ya.
I have to deal with this now.

09:11.376 --> 09:14.251
Bye, Frank.

09:18.042 --> 09:22.001
Don't forget baby swimming today.

09:23.167 --> 09:26.709
- Why? Do you have plans?
- I can't go in the water.

09:26.834 --> 09:30.042
The vagina-anus region
has to heal first.

09:30.167 --> 09:34.584
- Oh, right.
- That's what the doctor said.

09:37.167 --> 09:39.917
What... what's this?!

09:40.042 --> 09:43.751
- Have you seen this, honey?
- Yes.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.626
- "Casper sells luxury mansion."
- He's probably working the market.

09:47.751 --> 09:54.001
Starts over in the States. "I'm all in,"
says the successful entertainer.

09:54.084 --> 09:59.459
- Well, we don't see him much.
- He's had loads of chances to tell me.

10:02.584 --> 10:05.001
Oh, excuse me...

10:06.209 --> 10:11.584
Voice mail. Honey, I'll pop over...
I need to...

10:11.709 --> 10:15.001
What about baby swimming?
You can't go.

10:15.126 --> 10:17.584
- One hour.
- Tops!

10:29.459 --> 10:31.834
Cuckoo!

10:32.001 --> 10:35.751
- Casper?
- Frank? Hi!

10:35.876 --> 10:38.626
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

10:38.751 --> 10:42.792
- I was reading the paper...
- Okay. Yeah, I'm moving to the States.

10:42.917 --> 10:46.001
- Yes, I saw that.
- I'm heading out now.

10:46.084 --> 10:50.584
I can't even offer you anything.
I'm waiting for my driver.

10:50.709 --> 10:54.917
So, this is probably
your last time here.

10:55.042 --> 11:00.167
- This is insane...
- Don't sit on that. It was just done.

11:00.292 --> 11:06.792
- Weren't you gonna say goodbye?
- I'm no good at that, Frank.

11:06.917 --> 11:13.876
I was just gonna go. You'd be fine here
and 'pling' we'd email each other.

11:14.001 --> 11:16.376
Pictures and stuff.

11:16.501 --> 11:21.459
- But you should say goodbye...
- It's not like we're dating.

11:21.584 --> 11:24.001
No, sure. Thanks a lot.

11:24.084 --> 11:28.876
- But we do stuff together...
- We never do anything together.

11:29.001 --> 11:31.709
- The friendship book.
- It's finished.

11:31.834 --> 11:36.001
- It hasn't been approved yet.
- Then approve it.

11:36.126 --> 11:43.084
But there's other stuff. I have
thousands of ideas for future projects.

11:43.209 --> 11:46.584
We haven't had fun in years.

11:46.709 --> 11:49.459
- I think we have fun.
- When were we last out?

11:49.584 --> 11:54.792
A real night out. A hush-hush night.
When did we last do that?

11:54.917 --> 11:59.376
I'm not blaming you! You've got
your hands full with the kids and Mia.

11:59.501 --> 12:03.251
You're a family man!
But I'm in a different place.

12:03.376 --> 12:08.376
There's nothing here for me!
So I'm taking off.

12:11.584 --> 12:14.626
Could you grab the bird?

12:18.667 --> 12:23.584
- Will you take it to Iben?
- Aren't you taking it with you?

12:23.709 --> 12:29.001
I can't bring it to the States.
So, could you take it to Iben's?

12:29.084 --> 12:32.792
It's her week.
We have shared custody.

12:32.917 --> 12:36.751
Take care.
Bye-bye.

12:36.876 --> 12:40.709
Alright? Bye-bye.
Say hi to the family.

13:11.251 --> 13:15.251
- Hi, Iben, I was to bring this to you.
- 'Bring'?

13:15.376 --> 13:20.834
- From Casper. Your shared cockatoo.
- Never heard about it. I don't want it.

13:21.001 --> 13:27.292
- Then why did he say it's yours?
- I can't help it if you fell for that.

13:27.417 --> 13:30.501
- I think it belongs here.
- No, it doesn't. There. Go.

13:30.626 --> 13:34.542
Tell him that when he's man enough
to look after his daughter-

13:34.667 --> 13:38.751
- I'll consider looking after his
lame peacock for five minutes.

13:38.876 --> 13:44.292
But until then, he can go fuck himself.
Take the damn chicken away!

13:56.126 --> 14:00.251
- Oh my God, what now?
- I can't handle talking about it.

14:00.376 --> 14:05.584
And I can't handle that you're not here
in time for baby swimming.

14:06.417 --> 14:10.709
You say: 1, 2, 3.
Lift the baby-

14:10.834 --> 14:15.667
- and push it gently
to the other parent.

14:15.792 --> 14:20.709
- I'm relatively shaken, honey.
- Focus.

14:20.834 --> 14:24.001
1, 2, 3, now.

14:28.626 --> 14:33.542
- It's a pretty bizarre goodbye, honey.
- There's nothing you can do, honey.

14:33.667 --> 14:38.084
- No, but...
- Let it go. Don't obsess over it.

14:38.209 --> 14:41.792
He found a house over there!
He's not coming back!

14:41.917 --> 14:45.667
And he's completely abandoning me.

14:45.792 --> 14:50.167
- Okay, send him to me.
- I just did.

14:50.292 --> 14:52.501
Where is he?

14:52.626 --> 14:55.209
Has someone seen a baby?

14:59.459 --> 15:01.376
Sweetie!

15:07.292 --> 15:09.876
He's gone!

15:10.001 --> 15:14.292
Jackass! Why didn't you
grab him when she said 'now'?

15:14.417 --> 15:18.459
She didn't say now!
She really didn't, honey.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.001
- I did say 'now'.
- No.

15:22.126 --> 15:25.376
- I said: 1, 2, 3, now.
- Well, I didn't hear you.

15:25.501 --> 15:28.751
- I did say it.
- I'm not sure you did.

15:28.876 --> 15:31.042
I did.

15:31.167 --> 15:35.167
I was a bit out of it
because Casper left for the States.

15:35.292 --> 15:39.834
I think it's great that he went.
He's a party animal.

15:40.001 --> 15:42.584
- It's true!
- Sure he is.

15:42.709 --> 15:47.417
Do you know what, Mom? He sends
Frank pictures of him having sex.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.501
May I see?

15:49.626 --> 15:52.501
- They're not...
- They're on your phone.

15:52.626 --> 15:56.126
- I deleted them.
- Let me see.

16:01.001 --> 16:05.709
- Oh, you didn't delete them.
- Are they still there?

16:07.876 --> 16:10.376
Oh, my...

16:10.501 --> 16:14.334
- Is that her head?
- Yes, it's a standing 69.

16:14.459 --> 16:19.876
Why is her head upside down?
And what's that thing right there?

16:20.001 --> 16:25.334
It's gag drool. When the willy
hits the throat, she starts salivating.

16:25.459 --> 16:29.626
- Not much love in that.
- It's pornography.

16:29.751 --> 16:34.084
- I don't want to look at it.
- I for one think it's good he's gone.

16:34.209 --> 16:40.626
- You have nothing in common anymore.
- Find a new friend, Frank.

16:40.751 --> 16:46.376
We have a blast, Frank.
It's me and five other famous dads -

16:46.501 --> 16:51.834
- and Claus Meyer shows us how to make
exotic lunch boxes for the kids.

16:52.001 --> 16:58.084
- Who's your best friend, Lars?
- No doubt about that! It's Tina.

16:59.834 --> 17:02.417
They're asleep, honey.

17:02.542 --> 17:07.751
- Frank asked who my best friend is.
- And what did you say?

17:07.876 --> 17:10.459
I said: Tina.

17:11.501 --> 17:18.416
A great buddy. We have the rule
here in our Little Tuscany-

17:18.541 --> 17:21.626
- that every night, when we go to bed,
Tina says:

17:21.751 --> 17:25.084
I love you, Lars.

17:25.209 --> 17:30.834
And the first thing out of Lars's mouth
in the morning is:

17:31.001 --> 17:35.792
- I love you, Tina.
- Yeah.

17:35.917 --> 17:39.126
But your food is always...
What, honey?

17:39.251 --> 17:41.001
Grab Malthe's bag.

17:41.084 --> 17:47.542
... so these caring grownups
volunteer to watch out for the young.

17:47.667 --> 17:52.001
- It's not entirely safe.
- Have you ever been in danger?

17:52.084 --> 17:55.376
- Yeah, sure.
- So, honey. Let's go.

17:55.501 --> 17:59.501
- Lars is a Night Owl.
- Oh, okay.

17:59.626 --> 18:03.334
Remember we talked about
making a difference?

18:03.459 --> 18:05.334
Okay...

18:05.459 --> 18:09.667
- There.
- Damn, what an idiot.

18:10.626 --> 18:13.001
Bye-bye!

18:14.417 --> 18:18.167
It's funny that they've
named their house.

18:18.292 --> 18:23.251
We should do that too, honey.
We could call it...

18:23.376 --> 18:27.334
.... Chestnut Grove or something.
What do you think?

18:27.459 --> 18:33.001
I'm wondering what I should do now.
Work-wise, everything's changed.

18:33.084 --> 18:38.001
Casper is gone.
Maybe I should start a blog.

18:38.084 --> 18:43.917
I often get hopping mad over stuff.
I could get it all out in a blog.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.584
Do you think you love me
as much as Lars loves Tina?

18:49.709 --> 18:53.792
Honey, if you're banking on some
adult entertainment, you can drop it.

18:53.917 --> 18:58.917
- I can't handle it right now.
- That's not what I was talking about.

18:59.042 --> 19:03.709
- But you're touching me and everything.
- Yes!

19:03.834 --> 19:07.042
I can't handle it!
I'm under so much pressure!

19:07.167 --> 19:11.334
- I'm not talking about sex!
- Oh?

19:11.459 --> 19:15.376
And besides I can't do it yet.
In case you hadn't noticed.

19:15.501 --> 19:20.542
My peepee hasn't healed yet.
And... I mean...

19:25.876 --> 19:30.709
We need to go shopping tomorrow.
We're out of diapers.

19:30.834 --> 19:34.209
- Do you hear me?!
- Yes. Nice overview.

19:34.334 --> 19:37.501
Well, you don't have it.

19:42.126 --> 19:44.584
Where did we park?

19:45.542 --> 19:49.209
- Well?
- Level 3. Like last time you asked.

19:51.667 --> 19:54.417
Excuse me... Oh, hi Frank!

19:54.542 --> 19:57.584
- Hi, Nikolaj!
- Hi.

19:57.709 --> 20:00.167
- Nikolaj.
- My wife, Mia.

20:00.292 --> 20:03.876
- Mia.
- Nikolaj. What a coincidence!

20:04.001 --> 20:09.584
Yes! Great news about Casper!
Dropping everything and taking off.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.292
Yes. It's pretty wild.

20:13.417 --> 20:16.209
- An adventure.
- And what are you up to?

20:16.334 --> 20:19.751
Frank isn't doing much.
He's going to start blogging.

20:19.876 --> 20:24.459
- No, I'm not going to blog, honey.
- I thought you wanted to.

20:24.584 --> 20:29.917
No. I had an idea for a movie
about bloggers.

20:30.042 --> 20:34.084
- A feature film about bloggers.
- Right.

20:34.209 --> 20:39.001
And I have a friendship book
coming out. A book with Casper and me.

20:39.126 --> 20:43.501
- It could very well be a giant success.
- Hell, yeah.

20:45.292 --> 20:49.084
I have to tell you, Nikolaj...
you're so good as that knight...

20:49.209 --> 20:54.834
- Thank you. You watch the series?
- Oh, yes!

20:55.001 --> 20:58.126
- I'm a big fan.
- Wow. Thank you.

20:58.251 --> 21:02.667
- This is our level.
- No, this is level 2.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.751
Come on, honey.

21:04.876 --> 21:08.209
- Great seeing you.
- It was lovely, Nikolaj.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.584
This is stupid.

21:12.126 --> 21:16.376
God, he's handsome in real life.

21:16.501 --> 21:18.709
FRIENDSHIP THROUGH STORMS

21:18.834 --> 21:24.751
Remove the papers, we're decorating.
Remove the papers, please!

21:28.459 --> 21:33.001
I'll just... take care of the laundry.

21:33.126 --> 21:39.376
Ole and I are moving in,
so that we can give you a hand.

21:39.501 --> 21:43.751
- Is there an end-date on that project?
- No, not at all.

21:43.876 --> 21:50.292
Let me just put
the laundry basket here... Yes, super.

21:50.417 --> 21:56.501
- Honey, I'll finish reading upstairs.
- No, Dad's napping up there.

21:56.626 --> 21:59.501
- In my bed?
- Yes.

22:00.917 --> 22:05.459
He's tired.
He's an elderly man, Frank.

22:44.626 --> 22:48.542
Oh, man.
Seriously, Christensen...

23:16.542 --> 23:18.501
- Honey?
- Yes.

23:18.626 --> 23:22.626
I have to go to the States.
To see Casper.

23:22.751 --> 23:27.709
- You can't. You're on paternity leave.
- But you have Ole and Pykker now!

23:27.834 --> 23:32.042
- Uhm, they just sit and watch TV.
- I have to try to salvage it!

23:32.167 --> 23:37.001
- Why were you outside all night?
- Because the book is really good!

23:37.084 --> 23:42.834
He shouldn't sell the damn house.
He's a moron, but he's my friend!

23:43.626 --> 23:47.501
- I'm going over there to get him back.
- No! I don't think...

23:51.042 --> 23:53.584
I'm off to LA!

23:53.709 --> 23:58.001
- Mom, did you hear that?
- Yes, he's off to LA?

23:58.084 --> 24:01.501
- He can't. Didn't you tell him no?
- Yes!

24:01.626 --> 24:05.292
- Majorca?
- No! He's going to see Casper.

24:28.042 --> 24:32.709
Okay, stay away from South Central and
the bad areas and you should be all set.

24:32.834 --> 24:34.792
Have a good one.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.251
Frank? Up here!

25:25.376 --> 25:27.376
Hi!

25:27.501 --> 25:30.542
- What do you think?
- It's steep, huh?

25:30.667 --> 25:34.792
- It's a mountain!
- My bag almost rolled away from me.

25:34.917 --> 25:37.001
It's a mountain, Frank!

25:37.084 --> 25:41.834
- Home, sweet home!
- Wow.

25:42.001 --> 25:45.667
Place to hang out,
playing backgammon, chillin'.

25:45.792 --> 25:48.709
- But here's the best part!
- A pool?

25:48.834 --> 25:51.584
Hey, girls!
Say hi to Frank.

25:51.709 --> 25:53.584
Hi, Frank.

25:53.709 --> 25:56.626
My buddy, Jason.
Jason, this is Frank.

25:56.751 --> 25:59.001
- Welcome, Frank.
- Thank you!

25:59.084 --> 26:03.167
- Jason, were we class of '86?
- '86, brother, '86.

26:03.292 --> 26:06.376
The girls are just a bit of eye candy.

26:06.501 --> 26:09.292
Do you... do them?

26:09.417 --> 26:13.917
Yes, I got a pussy snout
only this morning.

26:14.042 --> 26:17.167
Your snout in the pussy.
And then three snorts.

26:17.292 --> 26:20.709
- Three breaths?
- Yes. Kicks off your day!

26:20.834 --> 26:24.751
- A pussy snout for you coming up!
- The one in orange is cute.

26:24.876 --> 26:29.834
That's Cille. My daughter.
Yes, she's cute, Frank.

26:30.001 --> 26:32.834
- Cille! Say hi to Frank!
- Hi, Frank.

26:33.001 --> 26:35.917
- Hi, Cille!
- Hang up when you say hi.

26:36.042 --> 26:38.876
Hopeless. Ignore her.
Let's find your room.

26:39.001 --> 26:44.001
- The Jason fella...
- He's awesome!

26:44.126 --> 26:48.042
- I call him Battle Cat.
- Battle Cat? I never heard of him.

26:48.167 --> 26:52.292
I talk about Battle Cat all the time!
Perfect, right?

26:52.417 --> 26:56.876
- It's lovely.
- King-size bed, the works. And look!

26:57.001 --> 27:02.376
Look at this. Wow, man!
Satisfaction that blows your mind.

27:02.501 --> 27:06.626
- Wow, looking good.
- Isn't it great?

27:06.751 --> 27:09.251
CC in Hollywood.

27:09.376 --> 27:13.876
You don't actually say Hollywood
when you live here. Danes always go:

27:14.001 --> 27:17.251
"Woohoo Hollywood".
Like you just did.

27:17.376 --> 27:20.709
Let's have a drink!
I'll mix a few!

27:20.834 --> 27:24.501
Have a shower and join us.
I'll be with the girls. And Battle Cat!

27:24.626 --> 27:30.709
- I'd like five minutes with you.
- Sure! We just had five minutes!

27:37.001 --> 27:40.376
- Hey, Frank! Join us!
- I just...

27:40.501 --> 27:42.792
Come on, Frank.

27:44.917 --> 27:49.001
- Pool prank, Frank.
- I'll go say hi to Cille.

27:51.209 --> 27:55.251
- Cactus! It's a cactus!
- Yeah, we have it all over here.

27:56.751 --> 28:00.042
- Hi.
- I didn't say proper hello.

28:00.167 --> 28:04.501
I haven't seen you in years.
Imagine you here, too.

28:04.626 --> 28:07.542
- You're not the only one from home.
- Right!

28:07.667 --> 28:10.584
- My jaws hurt from speaking English.
- You just arrived.

28:10.709 --> 28:15.292
Sure, but I talked to people on the
plane and at the airport. I'm wrecked.

28:15.417 --> 28:17.667
Take a dip in the pool.

28:17.792 --> 28:22.251
- Frank! Get in the pool!
- Let's see your best jump!

28:50.001 --> 28:52.042
Good morning!

28:52.167 --> 28:54.709
- Who are you?
- I am the housekeeper.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.459
- My name is Hoyt.
- Oh, hello.

28:57.584 --> 29:02.292
- Did you dream well?
- Uhm, I don't remember. Probably.

29:02.417 --> 29:04.709
That's good.
Dreamcatcher is working.

29:04.834 --> 29:09.417
It catches the good dreams
and holds them for you.

29:09.542 --> 29:12.376
- Is it...
- No, no, no! Don't touch.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.542
- It will bring you bad luck.
- Okay.

29:15.667 --> 29:20.084
- Real bad luck!
- Are you a native...

29:20.209 --> 29:22.167
I'm Navajo.

29:22.292 --> 29:28.334
I've always been on the Indians' side
when I saw cowboy movies.

29:28.459 --> 29:31.251
- Hm. Really?
- Yeah.

29:33.459 --> 29:36.292
- Morning, Cille.
- Good morning.

29:36.417 --> 29:40.542
This way! 3, 2, 1...
Catch!

29:42.834 --> 29:46.834
Throw it over my head,
and I'll catch it. On 3. Now!

29:52.667 --> 29:56.626
Where did it go?
You'll have to find it, Frank.

29:56.751 --> 29:59.376
Have some breakfast.

29:59.501 --> 30:02.667
Listen up. I'm throwing a party.

30:02.792 --> 30:07.459
What I have in mind is...
How would people know I moved here?

30:07.584 --> 30:11.209
I kinda kept it on the down-low.
I want to throw a Danish party.

30:11.334 --> 30:15.167
So all the Danes here will go:
Damn, Casper, CC, is in LA!

30:15.292 --> 30:17.751
CC in LA, you know?

30:17.876 --> 30:21.334
You could do a mix
of the letters CC and LA.

30:21.459 --> 30:25.167
LA and CC or... CC and LA,
what do you think?

30:25.292 --> 30:27.584
- I don't know.
- Both work!

30:27.709 --> 30:33.042
We'll have DJ Breum. JÃ¸rgen Klubien
on the guitar, the Rain Dance, you know.

30:33.167 --> 30:39.001
Lovely, beautiful little sweetheart,
please stop feeding Frank papaya.

30:39.084 --> 30:44.251
- Isn't it delicious, Frank?
- Yes, it's great papaya.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.792
I can't communicate with Frank
when he's chewing.

30:47.917 --> 30:52.459
You're sort of both right...

30:52.584 --> 30:55.251
Anyhow! We need a guest list...

30:55.376 --> 31:00.001
- Stop! This has to stop, Cille!
- See you later, Frank.

31:00.126 --> 31:06.042
Stop pouting! She's hopeless, Frank.
Completely hopeless.

31:07.209 --> 31:09.584
I'll go tell her off.

31:09.709 --> 31:12.292
And find the ball!

31:32.334 --> 31:35.001
Honey? Can you hear me?

31:36.917 --> 31:40.334
- Is there... Cuckoo.
- Hi.

31:40.459 --> 31:42.751
- Hi!
- Why are you calling now?

31:42.876 --> 31:47.001
- What?
- It's 2 a.m., Frank.

31:47.834 --> 31:52.709
It's the time difference, I forgot!
It's only 5 p.m. here.

31:52.834 --> 31:55.834
- Well, it's not 5 here.
- Right.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.417
Did you tell Casper
what you needed to say?

31:58.542 --> 32:03.001
- No. There hasn't been...
- Isn't that why you went?

32:03.126 --> 32:08.292
Yes! Yes, yes, honey.
I'm waiting for the right moment.

32:08.417 --> 32:12.501
For a natural... window.

32:12.626 --> 32:15.126
When I can work my magic.

32:15.251 --> 32:20.417
In the meantime, I'm minding
your children, the house.

32:20.542 --> 32:25.084
I'm minding a damn parrot
that bit my finger.

32:25.209 --> 32:30.626
- Isn't there...
- Hi, Frank! Hi, Mia! Hi, hi!

32:30.751 --> 32:35.209
- Are you asleep?
- Does it look like it?

32:35.334 --> 32:38.917
- Wave goodbye, Frank. We have plans.
- Gotta go, honey.

32:39.042 --> 32:42.792
- Take care.
- We're busy.

32:42.917 --> 32:45.626
We have to go!
I have a great idea!

32:45.751 --> 32:49.292
At the party, how about
if I appear with a Great Dane?

32:49.417 --> 32:52.334
Everyone will go:
Isn't that a Great Dane?

32:52.459 --> 32:56.626
And it is. But two Great Danes.
The great Dane with a Great Dane.

32:56.751 --> 33:01.792
- Just say you're a great Dane.
- I want people to say it.

33:01.917 --> 33:07.542
It's a Great Dane dog. You do get that?
I found a place! Come on, man!

33:07.667 --> 33:11.209
- Are you coming, Frank?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:12.292 --> 33:15.126
- A double knot, Frank?
- Yes.

33:15.251 --> 33:19.917
Come on! I don't wanna miss
out on this. I want that Great Dane.

33:20.042 --> 33:22.626
I always do a double knot.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.459
What the hell?

33:25.501 --> 33:29.292
Cille! Cille, damn it!

33:30.834 --> 33:34.917
Has she totally lost it? What the hell
do you need a double knot for?

33:35.042 --> 33:39.834
Now we don't have the car!
We could've dragged her out of there!

33:40.001 --> 33:43.917
- It takes a second to tie the knot.
- It takes a second to drag her out!

33:44.042 --> 33:48.209
- I was supposed to get the dog!
- We'll take my car.

33:50.792 --> 33:54.209
You can rent any car in the world,
and you pick this?

33:54.334 --> 33:57.251
It's perfect for parking.

33:59.001 --> 34:02.459
Are we listening to
Mexican music by choice?

34:02.584 --> 34:05.751
- It's all I could find.
- Allow me.

34:11.126 --> 34:15.417
Frank, seriously. Why would there
only be Mexican music?

34:15.542 --> 34:18.208
'Cause we're close to Mexico!

34:21.333 --> 34:23.333
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

34:23.458 --> 34:27.292
- I'm Savannah.
- Hey, my name is Casper.

34:27.417 --> 34:30.333
I called earlier
about a Great Dane.

34:30.458 --> 34:35.333
Oh. My sister and I were talking about
the Great Dane. This is the guy.

34:35.458 --> 34:38.458
- Hey, good to meet you.
- Hello. Frank.

34:38.583 --> 34:43.001
Are you sisters?
Oh, wow. Lucky parents.

34:46.251 --> 34:50.708
I wanna make sure that you're
aware of the dog's characteristics.

34:50.833 --> 34:54.626
- I am.
- The dog is noble. Are you noble?

34:54.751 --> 34:58.917
- I try to be as noble as possible.
- The dog is needy. Are you a needy guy?

34:59.042 --> 35:02.542
Oh, yeah.
I'm very needy.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.834
- It's a big dog, too.
- Very big. Are you big?

35:06.001 --> 35:09.167
Oh, yeah. I'm big.
I'm big.

35:13.542 --> 35:16.876
- Here. My address.
- See you later, girls!

35:17.001 --> 35:20.751
- See you, Frank!
- I'll bring him, don't worry.

35:20.876 --> 35:25.001
Bye. See you in a few.
Bye, baby.

35:26.542 --> 35:30.126
Their address!
We're going straight there.

35:30.251 --> 35:34.626
- No way. We're taking this dog home.
- It'll be fine there!

35:34.751 --> 35:37.626
- Right, Jack? See! He's nodding.
- No, he's not.

35:37.751 --> 35:42.626
Sure, he is. He loves this shit.
Look how cute. In with it.

35:42.751 --> 35:48.876
I want to go! It's a hush-hush trip!
You've gotta give me that.

35:53.792 --> 35:57.001
No need to lock the doors
when we're in the car, Frank.

35:57.084 --> 36:00.917
- It's a special neighborhood.
- Yeah, but don't lock us in.

36:01.042 --> 36:03.584
- Need help?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

36:03.709 --> 36:09.459
Her car is over there.
Fuck, this is wild!

36:18.042 --> 36:20.251
I don't dance.

36:24.084 --> 36:29.167
What are your hobbies, Desiree? What do
you like to do in your spare time?

36:29.292 --> 36:32.376
You know, I like to have fun.

36:32.501 --> 36:35.626
I like meeting people,
I like seeing the sights.

36:35.751 --> 36:39.376
I like what I'm seeing right now.

36:39.501 --> 36:44.751
- I play badminton.
- Frank? We'll just...

36:44.876 --> 36:50.834
- I'm just gonna give him a tour.
- Get some. Come on, man.

36:51.001 --> 36:53.167
Hush-hush trip. Come on.

36:53.292 --> 36:57.626
Don't worry, baby. They're just
gonna have a good time. I like you.

36:57.751 --> 37:03.126
I like your accent. I like that face.
You know, you've got a pretty face.

37:03.251 --> 37:08.001
- Thank you.
- I think you need to smoke this.

37:08.084 --> 37:12.251
You need to smoke this.
Smoke it!

37:14.709 --> 37:21.292
Yeah, baby. Take this off.
So I can see that pretty white face.

37:23.501 --> 37:27.834
That's right, baby.

37:33.751 --> 37:38.501
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you a minute.

37:39.709 --> 37:44.542
Desiree babe's gonna freshen up,
and when I come back -

37:44.667 --> 37:48.084
- I wanna see some pretty white dick.

37:48.209 --> 37:50.292
Okay.

37:51.084 --> 37:53.376
Okay.

38:03.876 --> 38:08.209
You'd better be ready for me!
I'm comin', are you ready?

38:08.334 --> 38:13.626
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Got that dick out?

38:17.001 --> 38:18.876
Come on, knot.

38:20.376 --> 38:22.167
Damn it...

38:25.459 --> 38:28.251
What the fuck?

38:28.376 --> 38:31.459
What the fuck is this shit?!

38:34.334 --> 38:38.209
What did you do, Jack?
There must've been something in my butt.

38:38.334 --> 38:43.501
- Salty minerals or something.
- Why the fuck was the dog licking you?

38:43.626 --> 38:48.126
I don't know. It happened in a split
second. I thought it was you, and...

38:48.251 --> 38:51.209
What the fuck did you think
was about to happen?

38:51.334 --> 38:57.209
You thought I was gonna lick your
foreign asshole? Fuck you, motherfucker.

38:57.334 --> 39:01.126
Sit your ass down. I'm gonna get
my niggas. We gonna fuck you up!

39:01.251 --> 39:05.834
- Fuck this shit, motherfucker!
- Where are you going, Desiree?

39:08.334 --> 39:10.251
Fuck...

39:10.376 --> 39:15.251
- ... some animal shit...
- ... whoop his ass all day.

39:18.792 --> 39:20.876
Casper...

39:24.042 --> 39:27.084
- Casper?
- What the fuck?

39:27.209 --> 39:30.001
We have to get out of here.

39:30.126 --> 39:32.876
- What are you doing?
- It's an emergency.

39:33.001 --> 39:37.751
- English! What happened?
- The boys from the street are coming.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.584
Casper, come on! Come on!

39:43.792 --> 39:46.501
- What now?
- That way!

39:50.917 --> 39:52.584
Why are you runnin'?

40:06.001 --> 40:08.292
Are we being followed?

40:10.417 --> 40:13.667
- We did it, Frank!
- Did we lose them?

40:13.792 --> 40:19.834
- Hush-hush. Woop, woop!
- That was hush-hush for sure.

40:20.001 --> 40:23.709
That was wild! Wild!

40:32.834 --> 40:36.876
Such a good boy...
That's right.

40:37.001 --> 40:41.834
- Look, Frank! It loves me!
- No, don't do that, dog.

40:42.001 --> 40:46.042
- Don't let it lick you.
- It's a dog, Frank! It's safe.

40:46.167 --> 40:49.542
You don't know
where its tongue's been.

40:52.084 --> 40:56.084
- You sure saw some action.
- Hell, yeah.

40:56.209 --> 41:00.084
- Did you get a pussy snout?
- I actually did.

41:00.209 --> 41:04.001
But I'm feeling a bit...
Listen...

41:04.084 --> 41:08.251
It feels like something's stuck.
Inside my nose.

41:08.376 --> 41:12.417
- Can't you tell by my voice?
- From her peepee?

41:12.542 --> 41:15.917
I'm not sure the pussy snout
is a good idea.

41:16.042 --> 41:20.501
- It was never a good idea.
- What the hell am I doing?

41:24.709 --> 41:28.542
- It's a shame if you sell the house.
- Why?

41:31.751 --> 41:35.667
- Because of you and me.
- You never come by, what do you care?

41:35.792 --> 41:37.834
That's...

41:40.584 --> 41:45.167
- That was a mistake on my part.
- I want to go home, Frank.

41:45.292 --> 41:50.751
- Please read the friendship book.
- We have a giant party to plan.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.834
That party is mega important.
The Great Dane.

41:54.001 --> 41:56.626
Alright!

41:56.751 --> 42:00.126
Where's the dog, Frank?

42:02.167 --> 42:05.501
Don't worry about it.
It was weird.

43:08.792 --> 43:12.584
Hoyt! It was an accident!

43:27.251 --> 43:30.042
- Morning, CC.
- Morning.

43:31.834 --> 43:35.501
- What up, Battle Cat?
- Franko!

43:40.001 --> 43:43.167
Very funny, Battle Cat.
Very funny.

43:44.126 --> 43:47.084
I love it when he makes that sound.

43:47.209 --> 43:50.209
Frank, do like this.

43:50.334 --> 43:54.084
- What did you do to your hair?
- What do you mean?

43:54.209 --> 43:59.417
You have no hair up top.
You look like an ass! Upstairs!

43:59.542 --> 44:04.334
- What the hell is that?
- You're bald on top!

44:04.459 --> 44:07.792
- It's terrible! I don't want to see it!
- It was shaved off!

44:07.917 --> 44:11.126
- Why did you do that, you idiot?
- I didn't!

44:11.251 --> 44:14.001
- It was worn off?
- It's Hoyt!

44:14.084 --> 44:18.042
- Hoyt?
- She scalped me. Indian style!

44:18.167 --> 44:24.042
- I touched the stupid dreamcatcher!
- Stop! Stop whatever the hell this is.

44:24.167 --> 44:27.667
- It makes no sense.
- She put up a Navajo dreamcatcher.

44:27.792 --> 44:30.792
I touch it. She scalps me.
Indian logic.

44:30.917 --> 44:35.292
No, Indian logic is bow and arrow
and teepee and...

44:35.417 --> 44:40.042
Wear a hat to the party!
And I never wanted hats at the party!

44:40.167 --> 44:44.417
I can't believe you're gonna wear a hat!
In her 5 days here, she's been great -

44:44.542 --> 44:49.126
- and then you come over, and there's
dreamcatcher on a willy and hair...

44:49.251 --> 44:52.376
You're not saying anything to Hoyt!

45:10.376 --> 45:13.667
Stop, stop.
Fuck, this is great!

45:13.792 --> 45:18.917
I've been looking forward to this
for years. The Great Dane in LA.

45:19.042 --> 45:21.042
Yes!

45:21.167 --> 45:26.167
And I'd like to thank you all for coming
and for supporting the project.

45:26.292 --> 45:29.001
You're all amazing!

45:30.542 --> 45:35.501
Some deserve special thanks. I want
to thank my lovely daughter Cille.

45:37.167 --> 45:40.876
She's here supporting me in my project.

45:41.001 --> 45:45.292
And I'd like to thank Morten Breum
who'll play for us!

45:45.417 --> 45:50.751
Last but not least, there's one
individual I owe special thanks.

45:50.876 --> 45:54.417
Someone who, for years,
has meant the world to me -

45:54.542 --> 46:01.459
- and who is my closest friend,
my oldest friend. Give it up for...

46:01.584 --> 46:03.751
... Battle Cat!

46:05.292 --> 46:11.001
And just to prove my point,
Battle Cat just told me -

46:11.084 --> 46:17.167
- that we'll have an extra guest.
Ladies and gentlemen: Adam Levine!

46:31.584 --> 46:33.834
Welcome, everyone!

46:51.292 --> 46:55.209
Do you think it's fair to scalp me?

46:55.334 --> 46:58.167
I mean... why?

47:02.542 --> 47:05.001
I have work to do.

47:10.417 --> 47:15.584
Let me introduce you to some people.
Murray, my good friend.

47:15.709 --> 47:19.251
- How are you?
- This guy is writing for HBO.

47:19.376 --> 47:23.126
- And this is...
- Whoa, hey!

47:23.251 --> 47:26.834
Frank. Have you seen that?

47:27.001 --> 47:30.001
Adam Levine from Maroon 5.
'Moves like Jagger'!

47:30.084 --> 47:34.834
This is a game changer for Casper.
A game changer, Frank!

47:35.001 --> 47:38.376
Okay. Good thing he came, then.

47:38.501 --> 47:42.459
- This is it, man.
- It's so beautiful.

47:51.001 --> 47:53.751
They're beautiful people.
So sweet.

47:53.876 --> 47:57.001
A buddy of mine was born
to American parents.

47:57.126 --> 48:00.876
They left him on the doorstep
of this reservation -

48:01.001 --> 48:05.126
- and he wound up being raised by these
native Americans. They took him in.

48:05.251 --> 48:08.459
Fed him, clothed him and raised him.

48:08.584 --> 48:11.209
S'up, man?
How are you doing?

48:11.334 --> 48:14.751
I just heard that you've visited
native Americans.

48:14.876 --> 48:19.584
- Yeah.
- And that you're fond of them.

48:19.709 --> 48:23.709
I'm sure there are wonderful, wonderful
native Americans around -

48:23.834 --> 48:26.626
- but I can tell you
there are shitholes, too.

48:26.751 --> 48:33.751
- Shitholes?
- I can point out... That's the woman.

48:33.876 --> 48:38.167
What could this sweet woman have
possibly done. Did you upset her?

48:38.292 --> 48:42.834
- She scalped me.
- That's just straight up racist.

48:43.001 --> 48:44.667
Look!

48:44.792 --> 48:46.751
Holy shit!

48:46.876 --> 48:49.251
- Look!
- Is that a joke?

48:49.376 --> 48:54.709
I can't tell if he's joking or not.
Wow, you just killed the vibe in here.

48:54.834 --> 48:58.459
- That's an evil Indian!
- Please don't...

49:00.376 --> 49:03.667
- You're a fucking asshole.
- She scalped me, man!

49:03.792 --> 49:07.792
- Fucking Dutch people.
- Hey, we had a discussion!

49:10.667 --> 49:13.501
Wow, he really took offense.

49:13.626 --> 49:15.917
Having a good time?

49:16.042 --> 49:19.001
What the hell? What's going on?

49:19.126 --> 49:22.126
He said something to Adam Levine.

49:22.251 --> 49:26.626
What the hell is going on, Frank?
Where's Adam?

49:27.917 --> 49:31.709
Fuck! Adam! Wait!

49:32.501 --> 49:37.167
It just kinda escalated.
It was both of us.

49:37.292 --> 49:42.126
We are two about it.
You have to be two to... an argument.

49:42.251 --> 49:47.459
What the fuck was that?
I was gone for one second!

49:47.584 --> 49:54.001
And you ruin everything! Where the hell
is the Great Dane party now?

49:54.126 --> 49:58.001
- You're the biggest moron I know.
- I'm not the moron!

49:58.126 --> 50:00.834
- You're a moron!
- You're a fucking moron.

50:01.001 --> 50:03.501
You come here at 46 to make it big!

50:03.626 --> 50:06.876
- As what? The Mummy?
- You're talking shit!

50:07.001 --> 50:10.876
I came to tell you there's stuff
in Denmark you can build on!

50:11.001 --> 50:15.167
- Hello! There's nothing back home!
- There's our friendship book.

50:15.292 --> 50:20.584
Shut up about that shitty book!
I'm never gonna read it!

50:20.709 --> 50:26.459
I don't want to deal with you anymore.
No more.

50:26.584 --> 50:30.501
We've run out of gas. It's over.

50:30.626 --> 50:33.042
I'm done with it.

50:33.167 --> 50:35.876
Wanna go, Battle Cat?

50:37.917 --> 50:40.751
Frank, the fuck-up.

50:54.751 --> 50:59.501
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Cille.

50:59.626 --> 51:02.292
Are you okay?

51:03.334 --> 51:05.542
- Not quite?
- Not really.

51:05.667 --> 51:10.376
I understand.
Casper totally overreacted.

51:10.501 --> 51:16.126
So don't lose your cool over it.
That's just how he is.

51:16.251 --> 51:19.376
That's sweet of you,
but it's too late...

51:19.501 --> 51:22.126
- Did it completely flatten you?
- Totally.

51:22.251 --> 51:24.709
Have a drink
and think of something else.

51:24.834 --> 51:27.834
- Did everybody leave?
- Yeah.

51:28.001 --> 51:32.417
- Another bright item for my CV.
- You emptied a party.

51:34.126 --> 51:37.334
- This tastes like crap.
- Yep.

51:37.459 --> 51:42.042
- Let's get in the pool.
- Yeah, why not.

51:42.167 --> 51:47.626
- I'll just get my trunks.
- No, fuck that. You don't need 'em.

51:47.751 --> 51:51.626
- I'm not wearing trunks?
- No! Nobody's home!

51:51.751 --> 51:54.917
Everyone's asleep.
There's nobody around.

51:55.042 --> 51:58.292
Here we go! Woohoo!

51:58.417 --> 52:02.126
- It's gorgeous. Just amazing.
- Is it nice?

52:02.251 --> 52:04.667
Here I come!

52:07.209 --> 52:10.001
It's cold!

52:13.209 --> 52:16.626
What a pick-me-up!

52:17.667 --> 52:23.626
I needed this.
This is the best thing on this trip.

52:23.751 --> 52:27.001
Come see the view.
It's beautiful.

52:27.084 --> 52:31.292
You can see the entire city.
It's awesome.

52:42.459 --> 52:45.751
- I think we should have sex, Frank.
- What?

52:45.876 --> 52:49.001
We should have sex.

52:52.751 --> 52:57.876
- Stop it, Cille.
- You're leaving soon anyway.

52:58.001 --> 53:00.709
I'm serious.

53:01.584 --> 53:05.001
Cille, for God's sake.

53:05.126 --> 53:08.334
Let's have sex.

53:09.792 --> 53:13.751
What the hell are you doing, Cille?

53:19.834 --> 53:22.334
I can't return that favour...

53:53.584 --> 53:56.376
Morning, Frank.

53:57.251 --> 53:58.709
Fuck...

53:58.834 --> 54:03.917
It's just sad to find out like this.

54:04.042 --> 54:07.542
To have to read the book
to understand -

54:07.667 --> 54:11.626
- how much our friendship means.
That's pathetic.

54:11.751 --> 54:18.501
I've been a giant asshole.
This ridiculous ego circus stops now!

54:18.626 --> 54:22.626
- I get it now, man!
- Did you just read it?

54:22.751 --> 54:27.792
I've been reading it for the past
six hours! I'm so embarrassed!

54:27.917 --> 54:31.209
Will you accept my apology?

54:31.334 --> 54:34.876
Come here! I'm sorry, Frank.

54:36.001 --> 54:40.251
You and I... we'll get through this.

54:40.376 --> 54:44.126
Why aren't you wearing any pants?
Why's your ass hanging out, Frank?

54:44.251 --> 54:47.584
- I just patted your naked ass.
- I was putting on sun lotion.

54:47.709 --> 54:53.876
Frank, we don't show our naked asses.
If the neighbors find out, they'll sue.

54:54.001 --> 54:57.584
- I was about to put them back on.
- Right now. Hey, Cille!

54:57.709 --> 55:01.876
Morning.
Good morning, Frank.

55:02.001 --> 55:04.584
- Stop, you two...
- What's going on?

55:04.709 --> 55:10.126
- Nothing, Cille.
- Don't look. He has no pants on.

55:10.251 --> 55:14.001
I love you both. You're my family.
This is it.

55:14.084 --> 55:20.042
This little cosy nook we're in here,
that's my family.

55:20.167 --> 55:27.001
Without you, I'd be dead. I would
kill myself if I couldn't trust you two.

55:27.126 --> 55:29.501
I love you.

55:29.626 --> 55:34.042
I love you.
Go put on some pants, Frank.

55:34.167 --> 55:38.834
- And sun lotion on your scalp.
- I'll just take a quick shower.

55:45.292 --> 55:50.501
We arrive at the lobster house in...
Hang on, sweetie.

55:50.626 --> 55:55.001
Do you remember the guy who owned it?
We have to do a follow-up!

55:55.126 --> 56:00.126
We've experienced tons of stuff!
It's Isla!

56:00.251 --> 56:03.167
- Hey, Casper.
- How are you doing today?

56:03.292 --> 56:07.001
- I brought your ball back.
- Hey. Good to see you.

56:07.084 --> 56:11.834
I know you had a party last night.
It's all good...

56:12.001 --> 56:17.334
But somebody was having sex outside
between your house and mine really loud.

56:17.459 --> 56:22.167
I could hear them. I thought a coyote
was getting killed or something.

56:22.292 --> 56:25.376
- I thought you should know...
- Say hi.

56:25.501 --> 56:30.626
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Nice to meet you.
- I really liked you in 'Shopaholic'.

56:30.751 --> 56:34.667
- I'm just gonna go for a minute, Dad.
- It was nice meeting you. Take care.

56:34.792 --> 56:38.126
Actually, it was her.
I recognize her voice.

56:38.251 --> 56:43.376
- What are you saying?
- I'm sorry. That's who was having sex.

56:43.501 --> 56:47.001
- I heard her. I know the voice.
- Are you sure?

56:47.084 --> 56:50.209
I'm an actor. I do an American accent.
I can hear accents.

56:50.334 --> 56:53.251
- That is who was having sex.
- And the man?

56:53.376 --> 56:58.042
- Could you recognize it...
- Definitely. Of course! Yes!

56:58.167 --> 57:00.542
- I'm so sorry.
- Hold on.

57:00.667 --> 57:07.417
Frank! We have a situation. Talk to Isla
for two minutes. This is an emergency.

57:07.542 --> 57:11.084
I'm really sorry. I feel like
I came over and ruined your day.

57:11.209 --> 57:15.209
Just hang on for two minutes.
Cille!

57:15.334 --> 57:18.876
I think I just caused
a major family drama.

57:19.001 --> 57:23.417
But what can I do? I totally heard her
having sex. She was very loud.

57:23.542 --> 57:27.501
And I've got kids. It's illegal.
It's indecent exposure.

57:27.626 --> 57:32.001
My daughter, can you imagine, she's six.
She can hear it. It's disgusting!

57:32.084 --> 57:37.001
Would you ever do something like that?
Have sex at a party in a public place?

57:37.126 --> 57:42.501
It's criminal misdemeanor.
I'm Isla, by the way.

57:43.209 --> 57:45.501
- What's your name?
- Frank.

57:45.626 --> 57:51.584
Frank. Well it must be nice
to see Casper. Do you miss him?

57:51.709 --> 57:55.501
Where are you... okay.

57:55.626 --> 57:58.917
This view is amazing.
We've got the same view actually.

57:59.042 --> 58:02.542
If you come across to...
Are you going in?

58:02.667 --> 58:07.126
Do you want me to take your hat
or your glasses or something?

58:14.501 --> 58:18.584
- Lovely!
- Nice to meet you, Frank!

58:18.709 --> 58:21.042
- See you.
- See you.

58:21.167 --> 58:24.501
Tell Casper I had to go.

58:24.626 --> 58:27.709
He's so weird.

58:33.001 --> 58:38.376
Frank. I just talked to Cille.
She fucking admitted everything.

58:38.501 --> 58:44.334
I'm furious!
Wanna hear something disgusting?

58:44.459 --> 58:49.084
She says... and this is verbatim:
"Dad, I shagged someone over 40."

58:49.209 --> 58:54.751
At my party! The pig! It's illegal!
Straight to prison with that guy.

58:54.876 --> 58:59.334
- It's not illegal to be over 40.
- Yes, if you fuck a 20-year-old!

58:59.459 --> 59:02.626
- Do you see why I'm out of my mind?!
- Sure!

59:02.751 --> 59:06.001
What are you doing?
Are you packing?

59:06.084 --> 59:09.292
Mia called.
There's news about my blog.

59:09.417 --> 59:13.459
- Blog?
- It's taking off. I should...

59:13.584 --> 59:17.459
There's no plane until tomorrow.
So calm down.

59:17.584 --> 59:23.292
Top Gun, Zipper, all the rappers
actually, are out. They're too young.

59:23.417 --> 59:28.542
- Let it go, Casper. Just...
- No way! I'll never let it go.

59:28.667 --> 59:32.417
Who do you think it is?
Did you sense anything yesterday?

59:32.542 --> 59:34.876
Did you see anything, Frank?

59:35.001 --> 59:40.292
- A shot in the dark...
- Go!

59:40.417 --> 59:43.084
Battle Cat.

59:46.251 --> 59:50.792
Frank, let me be brutally honest.
If it's Battle cat...

59:50.917 --> 59:55.001
- He's that age...
- Yes, yes, I hear you.

59:55.126 --> 59:57.834
But he's a close friend.

59:59.334 --> 01:00:01.709
- Hoyt!
- It's not Hoyt.

01:00:01.834 --> 01:00:05.042
I know that.
Hoyt!

01:00:05.167 --> 01:00:08.001
- Sir?
- Listen to me carefully.

01:00:08.084 --> 01:00:10.417
You're fired.

01:00:10.542 --> 01:00:16.084
I want you out of my house. I will
not accept what you did to my friend.

01:00:20.626 --> 01:00:24.334
- I'm tired. I'm off to bed.
- Frank, before you go.

01:00:24.459 --> 01:00:31.334
I'm sending Cille home. This area
is crawling with sex offenders!

01:00:31.459 --> 01:00:36.001
You'll have to take her home.
I already booked the flight.

01:00:36.126 --> 01:00:41.001
I called Christopher in Denmark.
Everything's been arranged.

01:00:41.084 --> 01:00:46.459
You sit together. Comfort her.
You're the only one I can trust!

01:00:46.584 --> 01:00:51.292
I want her home and safe.
This country's too dangerous.

01:00:57.417 --> 01:01:03.167
This can't get out, Cille.
Mia would leave me.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:07.126
And I'd never see Casper again.
We have to put a lid on it.

01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:09.876
Agreed?

01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:12.209
Cille!

01:01:12.334 --> 01:01:14.334
What?

01:01:14.459 --> 01:01:17.084
We have
to put a lid on what happened.

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:19.417
- Frank, chill.
- No, I...

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:24.251
Frank, stop!
It doesn't matter!

01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:26.917
Just stop it.

01:01:38.376 --> 01:01:40.709
- Hi! There he is.
- Dad!

01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:43.626
Isn't that your wife?

01:01:43.751 --> 01:01:46.042
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:01:47.292 --> 01:01:50.001
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi, welcome home.

01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:53.584
It's so good to see you.
Hi.

01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:58.417
- What a surprise!
- How nice that you came!

01:01:58.542 --> 01:02:02.084
I remember when you were...
When did we look after her?

01:02:02.209 --> 01:02:07.917
- You wanted to sleep in our bed.
- That won't do anymore, Frank.

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:11.334
- No... Shall we get going?
- Yes.

01:02:11.459 --> 01:02:13.876
- Take care.
- See you, Frank.

01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:15.751
Yeah... bye.

01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:45.334
You have a text from Cille.

01:02:46.251 --> 01:02:50.417
She says she hasn't gotten her period.

01:02:50.542 --> 01:02:54.042
Why would she write that to you?

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:59.876
- I don't know.
- Look.

01:03:01.084 --> 01:03:05.584
- Well?
- I have no clue.

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:13.917
- Is she pregnant?
- I don't know.

01:03:14.042 --> 01:03:16.167
What?

01:03:20.126 --> 01:03:26.751
In the States,
there were times when she...

01:03:26.876 --> 01:03:31.876
... confided in me,
because she couldn't talk to Casper.

01:03:32.001 --> 01:03:35.501
So you became her confidante?

01:03:36.501 --> 01:03:39.376
Yes. Uhm...

01:03:39.501 --> 01:03:45.251
I think I'll give her a call, honey.
It may be serious.

01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:55.876
Hi, Cille. This is Frank.

01:03:56.001 --> 01:04:00.792
I just got your text.
Hang on...

01:04:02.709 --> 01:04:05.126
What, honey?

01:04:08.667 --> 01:04:11.042
Hang on, Cille.

01:04:12.334 --> 01:04:16.001
I'm back.
We can't panic!

01:04:16.084 --> 01:04:22.084
We keep each other updated.
You and me. No one else.

01:04:22.209 --> 01:04:25.584
Okay. Yes, bye.

01:04:33.834 --> 01:04:36.001
- Hi!
- So?

01:04:36.126 --> 01:04:39.376
She was so happy I called.

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:43.251
You've all done great,
so we'll take a short break -

01:04:43.376 --> 01:04:50.001
- with free play for a few minutes.
Let the water carry the child.

01:05:17.251 --> 01:05:22.126
- You fucked Cille.
- What? No! Never!

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:26.417
That is the most insane accusation!

01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:31.917
Frank, you fucked Cille
at the Great Dane party.

01:05:32.042 --> 01:05:34.001
Okay.

01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:41.709
And my reaction is: Mia needs to know
that we can't trust you.

01:05:41.834 --> 01:05:46.084
- She doesn't have to know that.
- Oh, but she does.

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:50.667
Of course she should know
that her hubby is fucking my daughter.

01:05:50.792 --> 01:05:56.334
- Casper, you don't have to tell anyone.
- Then you have to do something else.

01:05:56.459 --> 01:05:59.167
Then we'll
have to find another solution.

01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:03.792
- What do you want?
- You fucked Cille.

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:08.501
Ergo, I'll fuck Mia.
This is how it's gonna go down.

01:06:08.626 --> 01:06:12.042
You check into a hotel.
You blindfold her.

01:06:12.167 --> 01:06:16.126
And then I stick it to her
and fuck her.

01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:20.209
- I doubt she's interested in that.
- This is about you and me.

01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:24.001
- That's just how it'll be.
- What are we talking about...

01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:29.209
- Or I could tell Mia everything!
- No, no! We'll work something out.

01:06:29.334 --> 01:06:32.834
It's just a question of how long.
A minute? 60 seconds.

01:06:33.001 --> 01:06:36.042
- That's a long time!
- No, it isn't, Frank.

01:06:36.167 --> 01:06:39.917
- Yes, it is. One minute?!
- 40 seconds?

01:06:41.876 --> 01:06:47.001
- 12.
- I'd need a stop watch!

01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:55.251
- 30.
- 30 seconds? Okay. Fine.

01:06:55.376 --> 01:06:59.042
It's a deal. 1-1, Frank.
An eye for an eye when you screw up.

01:06:59.167 --> 01:07:01.626
Say hi to the family.

01:07:52.292 --> 01:07:54.542
What the hell?!

01:07:56.501 --> 01:08:00.001
Sweetie! Little sweetie!

01:08:03.126 --> 01:08:07.084
Was it fun to swim with daddy?
Was it fun?

01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:09.209
I think he's tired.

01:08:10.876 --> 01:08:15.876
The event at Gyldendal Publishers
is kinda exciting, Frank.

01:08:16.001 --> 01:08:22.126
'Christmas reception'. My parents
can watch the kids, so I can join you.

01:08:23.084 --> 01:08:26.001
- Would you like that?
- Sure...

01:08:27.751 --> 01:08:32.209
I want to see my clever husband,
that I'm quite proud of.

01:08:32.334 --> 01:08:38.917
And we're going to Gyldendal's no less.
Together with the elite.

01:08:39.042 --> 01:08:43.126
- I thought we might cuddle a little.
- Now?

01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:48.167
I've healed.
It's lovely down there now. Come.

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:51.709
I'm having an idea...

01:08:53.501 --> 01:09:00.084
Why don't we make a really big deal
out of you healing so beautifully-

01:09:00.209 --> 01:09:07.667
- and celebrate it, perhaps in a hotel?

01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:11.542
At the Phoenix.
Like in the old days.

01:09:11.667 --> 01:09:15.792
- And a really nice...
- Have you been planning this, honey?

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:19.709
Sure, I've thought about it.

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:22.834
I'd love to.

01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:27.709
A whole day without the kids?

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:36.376
Staying in a hotel. Being naughty.
Would you like that?

01:09:39.584 --> 01:09:45.667
- Just making love. Hm?
- Yes.

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:49.501
So, do we have a plan?

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:52.792
May I have a kiss?

01:09:52.917 --> 01:09:56.792
- Yeah...
- I can't wait for Wednesday.

01:09:56.917 --> 01:10:00.376
- I love you, honey.
- I love you, too, sweetie.

01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:07.751
It's always all about the kids, and then
you tend to forget about each other.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:12.209
And all the erotic stuff.

01:10:19.126 --> 01:10:21.417
Look how beautiful, honey.

01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:24.001
- Good evening.
- A room?

01:10:24.084 --> 01:10:26.917
Yes, a room for Hvam.

01:10:28.084 --> 01:10:31.501
- Room 1218.
- Thank you.

01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:37.417
There, my sweet.

01:10:37.542 --> 01:10:43.584
I was thinking... When we begin,
perhaps we could...

01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:48.209
Would you like to try it blind?

01:10:48.334 --> 01:10:51.792
- Blind?
- Blindfolded...

01:10:51.917 --> 01:10:56.542
- Oh... sure, I'd like that.
- I just thought...

01:10:56.667 --> 01:11:00.251
- It's been ages since we...
- Did you bring a blindfold?

01:11:00.376 --> 01:11:04.501
- I brought one just in case.
- I'd like that.

01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:09.709
I'll get comfortable, honey.

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:17.001
- We're doing it now, right, honey?
- Yes, I'm taking off the cover...

01:11:17.084 --> 01:11:21.501
Let's get it over with...
I mean, let's get to it.

01:11:27.167 --> 01:11:30.042
Hi, honey.

01:11:49.334 --> 01:11:52.084
- It's a bit tight.
- Can you see anything?

01:11:52.209 --> 01:11:54.001
No.

01:11:57.626 --> 01:12:01.709
- I'll just get undressed.
- Mmm.

01:12:15.626 --> 01:12:18.334
Are you coming, honey?

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:21.001
I'm right here.

01:12:21.126 --> 01:12:25.792
- Are you naked?
- Almost there.

01:12:27.334 --> 01:12:31.917
- I can't wait to feel you.
- Right...

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:44.501
Are you coming, honey?

01:12:57.709 --> 01:13:01.042
- What?
- Why aren't you wearing a condom?

01:13:01.167 --> 01:13:03.417
- Is she sick?
- No!

01:13:03.542 --> 01:13:07.376
- You have to wear a rubber!
- Give it a fucking rest!

01:13:07.501 --> 01:13:11.834
For a 30-second fuck,
I'm not gonna waste a condom!

01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:17.209
- I bought some.
- You're so fucking clever.

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:55.376
What the hell are you doing, man?
We had a deal! It has to be 1-1!

01:13:55.501 --> 01:13:59.209
- It's not gonna happen.
- You know what that means.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:01.709
Then it's not 1-1!
We're not even!

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:06.251
You'll live to regret it, Frank.

01:14:06.376 --> 01:14:11.292
Something's happening, sweetie.
I just had to get out of my briefs.

01:14:15.001 --> 01:14:21.292
- What's wrong, honey?
- I don't know. Jet lag maybe.

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:26.501
I'm not sure I can, honey.
I'm so disappointed in myself.

01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:30.126
Look how beautiful.

01:14:32.417 --> 01:14:37.042
- Do I look okay?
- Just checking if Casper texted.

01:14:37.167 --> 01:14:38.834
Shall we?

01:14:39.001 --> 01:14:43.001
- Hi, Johannes.
- Hello. Welcome.

01:14:43.126 --> 01:14:47.334
- Congratulations on your book.
- Thank you. Have you seen Casper?

01:14:47.459 --> 01:14:51.209
He's around somewhere.
I saw him arrive.

01:14:51.334 --> 01:14:53.667
I'm sure you'll spot him.

01:14:53.792 --> 01:14:57.209
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:14:57.334 --> 01:14:59.001
Hi. Frank.

01:14:59.126 --> 01:15:03.751
Look! Ib Michael.
Hi.

01:15:03.876 --> 01:15:09.001
Congratulations on your book.
A whole new world is opening up.

01:15:09.126 --> 01:15:13.459
- Yes.
- To exist in print, too.

01:15:13.584 --> 01:15:16.626
Hello, everyone.

01:15:19.167 --> 01:15:23.542
Welcome to the Gyldendal
Christmas gathering.

01:15:23.667 --> 01:15:28.209
This year we are fortunate enough
to be able to combine it with -

01:15:28.334 --> 01:15:31.042
- two important publications.

01:15:31.167 --> 01:15:35.084
Ib Michael's 'Reflections',
a story from the seven seas.

01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:39.542
And 'Friendship Through Storms',
a friendship book -

01:15:39.667 --> 01:15:43.501
- with Casper Christensen
and Frank Hvam. It's on its way-

01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:46.792
- and a fresh
conversation piece for today.

01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:59.376
I'll happily kick this off.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:05.584
I'm sorry to inform you
that this book will not be published.

01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:10.417
Don't laugh. It's true.
Let me share with you why.

01:16:10.542 --> 01:16:16.001
I just threw a bash in LA, and what
happens is that Frank decides to...

01:16:16.126 --> 01:16:19.834
... yes, let's put the cards
on the table, Frank.

01:16:20.001 --> 01:16:24.501
During this party,
Frank fucks my daughter.

01:16:24.626 --> 01:16:28.709
Yes, it's true.
Let's put it up on the monitor.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:32.626
I give you the evidence.

01:16:32.751 --> 01:16:35.834
- That's not Frank.
- That's not me!

01:16:36.001 --> 01:16:41.001
It's my daughter, Cille, it's Frank,
and it's a sunbed and it's LA.

01:16:41.126 --> 01:16:44.501
No! That's not me!
It's someone who looks like me!

01:16:44.626 --> 01:16:48.876
It's all blurry.
No one can see a thing!

01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:51.542
Exhibit number one! Baldy!

01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:55.834
Hey, hey, hey!

01:16:59.292 --> 01:17:00.751
Mia!

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:09.209
We don't hit authors here.
Only critics.

01:17:09.334 --> 01:17:11.084
Honey!

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:12.709
Mia!

01:17:18.626 --> 01:17:20.834
Mia!

01:17:23.292 --> 01:17:25.584
Honey... honey!

01:17:26.626 --> 01:17:29.876
Open the door, so we can talk about it!

01:17:30.001 --> 01:17:33.876
Honey!
Honey! Honey!

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:49.292
Mia?

01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:53.001
Mia?

01:17:54.001 --> 01:17:55.917
Honey?

01:18:18.751 --> 01:18:22.126
We're here for Mia's toothbrush
and stuff.

01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:26.792
- I'd better get it myself.
- Can we talk for a minute, honey?

01:18:26.917 --> 01:18:29.417
I don't think so.

01:18:31.667 --> 01:18:37.126
- Frank, that's not a good idea.
- But I have to talk to her, Tina.

01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:41.376
- What about?
- The kids and... what we do now.

01:18:41.501 --> 01:18:44.376
- Honey?
- You have five minutes.

01:18:44.501 --> 01:18:46.751
You can have five minutes.

01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:55.917
This... is just about the worst thing
you can do in a relationship.

01:18:56.042 --> 01:19:00.751
It's like throwing a hand grenade
at another human being.

01:19:00.876 --> 01:19:06.001
That hurts! And then it detonates,
and then it hurts again. Disgusting!

01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:09.667
May I have a word with my wife?

01:19:14.376 --> 01:19:16.376
What do we do, honey?

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:20.084
I need space and...

01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:24.876
I'll take the kids for Christmas.
Don't contact me.

01:19:25.001 --> 01:19:27.376
Throughout Christmas.

01:19:29.292 --> 01:19:32.209
I'll go get my things.

01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:42.042
Honey! I just got a text from Cille.

01:19:42.167 --> 01:19:46.001
She's having her period!

01:19:46.126 --> 01:19:51.626
- So she's not pregnant.
- Did you fuck her without a condom?

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:56.001
Damn...

01:19:56.126 --> 01:19:58.917
- Come, Tina.
- Disgusting, Frank.

01:19:59.042 --> 01:20:02.334
I thought you knew that, honey?

01:20:02.459 --> 01:20:06.542
That someone had told you...

01:20:16.001 --> 01:20:18.709
Frank!

01:20:18.834 --> 01:20:22.001
How's your blog going?

01:20:25.792 --> 01:20:28.001
Merry Christmas.

01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:43.209
Ãvlisen?

01:20:43.334 --> 01:20:47.251
<i>The book on everybody's lips,</i>
<i>but which nobody has read.</i>

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:51.751
<i>And they never will, according to you.</i>
<i>Welcome. Why shouldn't we read it?</i>

01:20:51.876 --> 01:20:56.751
<i>Because it's a book about</i>
<i>two people that were friends.</i>

01:20:56.876 --> 01:21:02.292
<i>- The friendship is over.</i>
<i>- Why does it evoke such emotion?</i>

01:21:02.417 --> 01:21:09.042
<i>Frank was my friend for many years,</i>
<i>and he completely betrayed me.</i>

01:21:09.167 --> 01:21:15.751
<i>That obviously resulted in a breakdown</i>
<i>between us, which was painful but...</i>

01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:40.334
Frank!
Standing here all by your lonesome?

01:21:40.459 --> 01:21:43.167
- Hi, Ulrich.
- What are you doing?

01:21:43.292 --> 01:21:47.584
- Eating a hotdog.
- Haven't had one forever. One hotdog!

01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:52.167
- What's up, my boy? You look miserable.
- I don't know if you heard...

01:21:52.292 --> 01:21:55.584
Heard what? I have good news.

01:21:55.709 --> 01:22:01.376
Tonight, a truckload of your books leaves
the harbor. It'll be all over the country.

01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:05.417
- The friendship book?
- How many other books did you write?

01:22:05.542 --> 01:22:10.834
- But Casper doesn't want it published.
- He's always complaining.

01:22:11.001 --> 01:22:14.417
- I've had it with his bullshit.
- Just 'cause you've got money in this?

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:18.626
- Sure, that's part of it.
- But Casper will get hurt.

01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:22.626
Casper will get hurt?
Shut up...

01:22:22.751 --> 01:22:25.501
This tastes like shit.

01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:31.667
Frank, you and Casper...
were you ever really that close?

01:22:31.792 --> 01:22:34.209
Thanks for dinner.

01:22:47.126 --> 01:22:49.917
Hey! You didn't pay!

01:22:50.042 --> 01:22:52.501
Taxi!

01:22:52.626 --> 01:22:57.417
- To the harbor.
- Looking for a good time?

01:22:57.542 --> 01:23:02.126
- A good time?
- That's where the hookers are.

01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:06.417
No, no, no, no...
I just have to get there.

01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:10.459
- Oh, okay.
- I'm going to steal a truck.

01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:15.542
Stop!
Yes! There it is!

01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:18.834
Here! Stop.
Thank you. Keep the change.

01:23:46.292 --> 01:23:50.334
- Yes?
- Hello? Excuse me!

01:23:51.542 --> 01:23:55.126
- Lars?
- Hi, Frank.

01:24:00.834 --> 01:24:03.584
What are you doing?

01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:07.792
- I'm just on... Night Owl duty.
- Okay.

01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:13.126
- And this is part of your duties?
- Yes, it's all part of it.

01:24:13.251 --> 01:24:17.751
We'll talk about it some other time.
I need your help. I need a hand.

01:24:17.876 --> 01:24:20.292
I'm your man.

01:24:34.042 --> 01:24:36.834
See you, Lars!

01:25:18.626 --> 01:25:21.209
- Hi.
- What the hell do you want?

01:25:21.334 --> 01:25:25.417
- I want to show you something.
- No. We're not doing this, Frank.

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:30.001
Christensen! Two seconds,
and I'll leave! It's important!

01:25:30.084 --> 01:25:32.876
It had better be, Frank.

01:25:34.792 --> 01:25:37.501
It's a truck with all our books.

01:25:37.626 --> 01:25:42.417
If you don't want it published,
then of course it shouldn't be.

01:25:42.542 --> 01:25:46.209
Do with them as you please.
Hi, Cille.

01:25:47.292 --> 01:25:51.042
What are you doing?
Why are you letting him leave?

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:55.584
Frank, come back!
He's your best friend! Come back!

01:26:16.834 --> 01:26:19.459
- Yes?
<i>- It's me!</i>

01:26:19.584 --> 01:26:21.501
- Hi.
<i>- Hey! Hi.</i>

01:26:21.626 --> 01:26:26.709
<i>Uhm... awesome, with the books.</i>
<i>Great job.</i>

01:26:26.834 --> 01:26:30.292
Okay. Well, if you don't want it
published, then it shouldn't be.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:35.501
<i>Seriously, Frank. Let's move on.</i>
<i>I have no problem forgiving you.</i>

01:26:35.626 --> 01:26:40.917
- Yeah? Well, I forgive you, too!
<i>- That's where we're at now, right?</i>

01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:45.417
<i>Let's be mature about this</i>
<i>and move on! Great!</i>

01:26:45.542 --> 01:26:48.584
<i>And Frank, I have an idea.</i>

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:53.084
<i>I'm looking at the truck</i>
<i>and doing some calculations -</i>

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:56.917
<i>- and there's 30M kroner's worth</i>
<i>of books in that truck!</i>

01:26:57.042 --> 01:27:00.626
<i>Now that we're friends,</i>
<i>the book should be published!</i>

01:27:00.751 --> 01:27:03.542
<i>- Come over.</i>
- I'll be right there!

01:27:03.667 --> 01:27:08.001
<i>- We'll drop off Cille at Iben's.</i>
- Sure!

01:27:08.126 --> 01:27:12.042
Great, CC! Bye.

01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:20.876
- Can I drive it?
- Yes! Drive!

01:27:21.001 --> 01:27:24.667
Shut up, and let me focus.

01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:31.917
Cheers!

01:27:33.334 --> 01:27:36.084
Don't say anything about the truck.

01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:45.834
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

01:27:47.917 --> 01:27:49.626
Hey, you.

01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:53.292
- I'll call you, Dad.
- Yes, do!

01:27:53.417 --> 01:27:57.459
- So... Merry Christmas.
- Yes, Merry Christmas.

01:27:57.584 --> 01:28:01.292
- Your hair looks great...
- Shut your fucking ass!

01:28:01.417 --> 01:28:05.001
You throw her in the arms
of a bunch of pedophile bastards!?

01:28:05.126 --> 01:28:07.251
What the hell, Uncle Frank!?

01:28:07.376 --> 01:28:10.792
I'm shocked
at your general unfitness!

01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:15.542
As a father, as a human being.
As everything! We're done! Totally done!

01:28:15.667 --> 01:28:18.292
Yes. So... yes.

01:28:19.001 --> 01:28:21.751
Fuck you.

01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:34.001
- What now?
- Another 500 meters then turn right.

01:28:34.126 --> 01:28:39.584
We're here!
And Frank, I'm so impressed with you.

01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:44.209
And it's awesome
that you forgive me, too.

01:28:44.334 --> 01:28:46.292
Yes, of course.

01:28:46.417 --> 01:28:52.501
The Phoenix stunt, damn! The fact that
I had my dick inside Mia for 5 seconds -

01:28:52.626 --> 01:28:56.042
- would've been too much
for most men.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:01.292
- What?
- You left to get condoms.

01:29:01.417 --> 01:29:04.667
I stuck my dick in Mia to keep it hard,
you know.

01:29:04.792 --> 01:29:09.917
- You had your willy inside Mia?
- Yes. For five measly seconds! Jeez!

01:29:31.001 --> 01:29:35.334
- You're a crap friend!
- You fucking suck, Frank!

01:29:35.459 --> 01:29:37.626
What the hell did you do?

01:29:37.751 --> 01:29:41.584
- Ulrich! It's Frank!
- Ask Casper!

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:47.292
Is that my 30 million down there?
Get those books up! Now!

01:29:47.417 --> 01:29:51.376
- You're an asshole!
- Wait till I get my hands on you!

01:29:51.501 --> 01:29:54.584
I hate you!
I hate you!

01:30:51.167 --> 01:30:54.709
- You can sit here and relax.
- Yes, that's fine. Hi.

01:30:54.834 --> 01:30:59.417
- I'll come get you in about 30 minutes.
- Yes.

01:31:05.417 --> 01:31:08.042
Merry Christmas.

01:31:09.001 --> 01:31:11.292
Merry Christmas.

01:31:20.584 --> 01:31:23.917
That dog looks just like Jack.

01:31:26.667 --> 01:31:30.001
It licked my ass in LA.

01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:59.417
I never told you that...
Okay, fair enough.

01:31:59.542 --> 01:32:05.501
Battle Cat... as it turns out,
we never went to school together.

01:32:05.626 --> 01:32:09.751
He claimed that we...
And I did have trouble recognizing...

01:32:09.876 --> 01:32:14.042
He was just some guy I met in a bar,
and then somehow...

01:32:14.167 --> 01:32:16.917
So I <i>am</i> your oldest friend!

01:32:19.042 --> 01:32:21.251
What... uhm...

01:32:30.001 --> 01:32:33.792
We're on our way to my parents'
to celebrate Christmas...

01:32:35.292 --> 01:32:39.251
... and we just wanted
to wish you a Merry Christmas.

01:32:39.376 --> 01:32:44.292
Thank you.
And a Merry Christmas to you, too.

01:32:44.417 --> 01:32:49.292
- Fie, did you have a present for Dad?
- This is for you.

01:32:49.417 --> 01:32:54.292
Sweetie...
I don't have anything for you, honey.

01:32:58.126 --> 01:33:01.584
This makes me so happy, sweetie.

01:33:07.167 --> 01:33:09.876
How are you?

01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:13.459
We miss you a little bit.

01:33:13.584 --> 01:33:17.251
I miss you, too, honey.

01:33:22.209 --> 01:33:25.792
It was wonderful to see
Mia and the kids.

01:33:25.917 --> 01:33:29.334
It was just what I needed.

01:33:29.459 --> 01:33:33.292
Look what I figured out.
I stole the work shift schedule -

01:33:33.417 --> 01:33:41.042
- and tonight, December 24, all the
nurses without children are working.

01:33:41.167 --> 01:33:45.126
Obviously, those with kids are at home.
So, all the nurses working tonight -

01:33:45.251 --> 01:33:51.001
- are horny as hell.
So, I got my hands on this fella.

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:55.126
We get them tipsy
and have a Christmas hush-hush.

01:33:55.251 --> 01:33:59.001
- Come on, Frank. We need a good time.
- I'm done with the hush-hush.

01:33:59.084 --> 01:34:02.626
- Why?
- It's overrated.

01:34:02.751 --> 01:34:06.292
It's Christmas Eve! Jesus's birthday!

01:34:06.417 --> 01:34:10.084
Yes, but shouldn't we
tone down the hush-hush?

01:34:10.209 --> 01:34:13.001
I'm doing one of them for damn sure.

01:34:13.126 --> 01:34:15.459
- Good evening.
- Merry Christmas.

01:34:15.584 --> 01:34:18.709
Merry Christmas right back at you.

01:34:18.834 --> 01:34:23.792
Did you hear that? 'Merry Christmas'.
'Merry Christmas'. Look at that...

01:34:23.917 --> 01:34:27.376
I'll take the one in white, Frank.
They're going into room 2!

01:34:27.501 --> 01:34:31.167
That's our cue, Frank.
Let's get 'em. Come on!

01:34:31.292 --> 01:34:35.209
- Our cue?
- They don't have kids! I have wine.

01:34:35.334 --> 01:34:38.917
- Come on!
- How is that a cue for anything?

01:34:39.042 --> 01:34:41.667
- It's halfway inside already!
- No...

01:34:41.792 --> 01:34:45.209
- They went into room 2! I have wine...
- I'm not coming.

01:34:45.334 --> 01:34:48.001
- Come on, Frank!
- No!

01:34:48.084 --> 01:34:52.792
Hi, hi! I was wondering,
may one enter room 2?

01:34:52.917 --> 01:34:56.042
- Certainly.
- Absolutely.

01:35:05.459 --> 01:35:10.042
Okay, I'll have a glass!
Just the one.

01:35:10.167 --> 01:35:12.709
Casper, I'm coming!

01:35:45.209 --> 01:35:47.209
- Look, Frank.
- Huh?

01:35:47.334 --> 01:35:48.917
Look.

01:35:51.459 --> 01:35:52.792
Wow!

01:35:52.917 --> 01:35:54.834
Hi, Malthe.

01:35:54.959 --> 01:35:57.251
You can walk.
