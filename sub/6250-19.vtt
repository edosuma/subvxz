Give everything, my darling.

00:05.131 --> 00:08.089
Everything. Utter dross
to upper-class gloss. All right?

00:08.176 --> 00:11.464
Keep her lit.
Keep her bathed in the glow.
All right. Yes! Okay, good.

00:11.554 --> 00:14.591
Now, look up.
All r/ght Yes. Nice. Okay.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.970
- Right in front ofyou.
That’s the future. Yes. Okay.
- [Crows Can/mg]

00:18.060 --> 00:22.269
- What the hell is that?
- Pigeons, blackbirds or crows—
something along those lines.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.847
- Telephoto.
- God, he has an idea!

00:24.942 --> 00:27.934
This is what we need!
Caw! Caw! Yeah!

00:28.029 --> 00:30.736
Flap, ﬂap, ﬂap. Yea/7, yea/7.
Give me more! Yes!

00:30.823 --> 00:34.987
Fierce aviary wings! Yes!
Beaks! Caw, caw, caw, caw!

00:35.077 --> 00:36.817
Those creatures, they are death.

00:36.913 --> 00:40.201
Flap your arms, chase death away,
but remain beaut/ful. You understand?

00:40.291 --> 00:42.202
Running through
a vacant lot—
[Chuckles]

00:42.293 --> 00:44.909
at a bunch of birds
in six-inch heels!

00:45.004 --> 00:48.542
Ooh! Excellent.
Good, good, good!
You’re a leopard! Leap!

00:48.633 --> 00:50.999
You’re an angel!
Oh, yes! Beautiful!

00:51.135 --> 00:54.753
Beautiful! Terror! Fear!
Okay, gaze nea ven wardl

[ Police Radio Chatter]

01:07.401 --> 01:09.392
[Shutter Clicking]

01:11.781 --> 01:14.693
Oh. Okay, so what’s it
look like to you?

01:14.784 --> 01:17.321
An ear.
Did you just make a joke?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.322
- No.
- ’Cause that wouldn’t be like you.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.369
I didn’t. It looks like an ear.

01:21.457 --> 01:25.666
- What do you make of the stuff
in the blue bag there?
- Looks like chili con carne.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.244
Could this be
the rest of the person
who lost the ear?

01:28.339 --> 01:31.752
I don’t know.
It looks like chili con carne.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.209
There’s no single piece here
bigger than the skull
ofan Australopithecus.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.216
Sports terms, Bones.
Remember we talked about this?

01:38.307 --> 01:40.218
Oh, um—

01:40.309 --> 01:43.346
Ah! Softball. Good.
You’re getting better.
Size ofa softball.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.474
At first guess, the total mass
in this garbage bag...

01:46.565 --> 01:48.521
does not add up to
an entire human being.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.773
- Right. So I’ll get Forensics
to scour the entire lot.
- Yes.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.572
[Whispering] Hey, would you
even want to guess what happened
to this human being?

01:57.994 --> 02:00.406
No.
I knew you’d say that.
Ijust had to ask.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.532
All right, let’s scour it up!

02:02.623 --> 02:05.615
[ Police Radio Chatter]

02:07.003 --> 02:08.618
Wow.

02:08.713 --> 02:13.423
I’ve been a pathologist
for 13 years, and I admit,
lam... a little nauseated.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.672
It’s going to fall to me
to empty these bags, isn ’t it?

02:18.347 --> 02:22.215
All right, then, fine.
I may need a pot of tea waiting.

02:22.310 --> 02:26.679
Maggots place time ofdeath
somewhere between 48 and 72 hours.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.728
I’m gonna go with
a wood chipper on this.

02:28.816 --> 02:33.560
In that case,
it was a gold wood chipper.
This looks like gold.

02:33.696 --> 02:37.939
The ancient Sumerians were prone
to spreading gold dust over the body
during funeral rites.

02:38.034 --> 02:40.946
Did the Sumerians
chop up the body into
little tiny bits first?

02:41.037 --> 02:42.618
Not to my knowledge.

02:42.705 --> 02:46.118
- What is this?
- A black pearl?

02:46.208 --> 02:50.497
Pearls, symbolizing eggs
or rebirth and resurrection,
were used...

02:50.588 --> 02:52.203
in many South Seas
funeral rites.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.914
Did they chop up the bodies
into little tiny bits first?

02:55.009 --> 02:57.671
[Stammering]

02:57.762 --> 03:00.925
I’ve begun to apprehend
your point, Dr. Saroyan.

03:01.015 --> 03:04.132
Find out how many corpses
we’re dealing with.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.389
I’ll find out ifthese are
really gold flecks
and pearl fragments.

03:21.077 --> 03:23.489
Celibacy is a lot like fasting.

03:23.579 --> 03:26.321
So you’ve become
sexually anorexic?

03:26.415 --> 03:28.827
At first you’re out of sorts
and agitated,

03:28.918 --> 03:32.410
and then you sort of
push through
to a kind ofclarity.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.835
Have you reached clarity?
No, I’m still at the
agitated and horny stage.

03:36.926 --> 03:39.167
Why are you fasting sexually?

03:39.261 --> 03:42.173
Sweets thinks it will
do me good to put sex
on the back burner...

03:42.264 --> 03:45.427
in order to relate to people
in other—

03:46.894 --> 03:48.759
[Brennan]
Why are you listening to Sweets?

03:49.814 --> 03:52.055
Um—

03:52.149 --> 03:55.516
Ange/a, / asked why are you
listening to Sweets?

03:55.611 --> 03:58.353
Sweetie,
can you pay for this?
I have to go.

03:58.489 --> 04:03.153
Sure. Why?
I have to save
Hodgins’s life. Yeah.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.158
I found something interesting
on the cellular level.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.240
I don’t care about
the cellular level.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.995
No hemorrhagic tissue.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.452
- What?
- Means the victim was dead
before being chopped up.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.499
You care about that, right?
No, not really.

04:16.590 --> 04:20.503
- What I’m interested in is
how this guy got chopped up.
- Now, this here...

04:20.594 --> 04:23.506
shows that the cell burst
from the inside out.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.213
- Gives me nothing.
- Frostbite can do that.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.262
What, like
climbing a mountain?
Yes. Exactly.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.265
The water in the cells
crystallizes and explodes.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.314
/ha ve got
an absolutely fasc/nat/ng
clue to tell you about.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.608
Hey, hey, uh,
you have to leave town.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.936
What? Why?
No. Fascinating clue first.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.397
The pearl we found
in the victim wasn’t a pearl.
Why do I have to leave town?

04:43.492 --> 04:45.733
- My father is here.
- What was it then?

04:45.828 --> 04:48.865
Carbonaceous chondrites.
It’s what meteorites are made of.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.742
Your father blames me
for our breakup?

04:50.833 --> 04:54.496
Well, he has sort ofa blind spot
when it comes to me.

04:54.587 --> 04:57.704
- Sojust get out of town
until I can call him off.
- Stop. Okay? Stop it.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.047
Dead guy.
What about the dead guy?
It’s obvious.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.920
He was frostbitten
while climbing Everest,

05:02.052 --> 05:06.091
then struck by a meteor,
then dumped into a vacant lot in
two garbage bags and eaten by crows.

05:06.182 --> 05:08.639
All right. Obvious.
That’s so obvious.

05:08.726 --> 05:11.058
Hey, it’s a start.

05:44.762 --> 05:49.506
The slowest meteorites travel
at 25,000 miles per hour.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.184
- Uh-huh.
- I’m notjust spouting useless facts.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.182
You do not have a chance
of recreating those velocities...

05:56.273 --> 05:58.104
with a glorified blow gun.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.855
You simply want to fire
a cannon at a dummy.

06:01.946 --> 06:03.482
You staying or going?

06:04.865 --> 06:08.403
Another set of eyes and ears
taking note can never be amiss.

06:18.128 --> 06:23.589
What possible information could
this exper/ment ,oro wde us that
you cou/dn ’t get mathematically?

06:23.676 --> 06:25.758
Mathematics is theory.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.096
This is a real—world
recreation.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.671
In order to prove what, exactly?

06:32.268 --> 06:35.055
That a, uh, frozen person...

06:35.145 --> 06:36.726
struck by a meteorite...

06:36.814 --> 06:39.180
would turn into chili con carne.

06:39.275 --> 06:43.644
NASA has no record of a meteorite
ofthis size and type...

06:43.737 --> 06:46.649
striking North America
at the time ofdeath.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.446
Oh.

06:48.534 --> 06:52.402
According to NASA, a meteorite
match/ng these characterist/cs
is right here in D. C

06:52.496 --> 06:54.657
Oh.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.249
I’m all set up and everything.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.291
Your experiment is not pertinent.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.710
So, you found out
where the meteor came from?

07:08.804 --> 07:10.465
From the solar nebula.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.635
Right. Anything
more current than that?

[Both Coughing]

07:22.026 --> 07:23.732
We’re okay!

07:23.819 --> 07:25.730
Everything’s fine!

07:25.821 --> 07:28.278
We should get out of here
before lockdo wn.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.113

Yeah!

07:30.200 --> 07:33.067

Hoo!

07:34.538 --> 07:36.529
[Saroyan]
You know you’re grounded, right?

07:39.627 --> 07:44.041
So, you think the piece
of meteor we found in the
murder victim came from this.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.042
Yeah.
It’s an exact match.

07:49.261 --> 07:53.129
Well, you’ve heard of
Landis Collar, right?
Sure, I have. Mm-hmm.

07:53.223 --> 07:57.512
Blind guy. World’s leading
expert in superconductivity.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.969
Do you even know
what superconductivity is?

08:00.064 --> 08:01.770
I know it’s better
than normal conductivity.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.394
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan,
I’m Christopher Beaudette,

08:04.485 --> 08:06.771
senior scholar here at the Collar.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.853
Shall we?
Yes!

08:10.115 --> 08:12.026
So, you work in
superconductivity.

08:12.117 --> 08:17.032
No, Agent Booth. I’m doing
research into generating
power from earthquakes.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.746
Groundbreaking.
[Laughing]
That was a funnyjoke.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.745
Yeah, and one I’ve ne vel;
e ver heard before.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.918
Are these people here
smarter than you?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.166
That would depend on how
one defines intelligence.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.542
I’m Landis Collar.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.792
Thank you, Christopher.
Landis.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.094
I’m Special Agent
Seeley Booth.
This here is—

08:34.181 --> 08:35.591
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

08:35.724 --> 08:39.308
Is that clicking noise
attached to your blindness?
[Clicking]

08:39.395 --> 08:43.513
Yes. It’s a prototype—
sonic echo locator.

08:43.607 --> 08:46.098
It allows me to...

08:47.736 --> 08:50.113
[Laughs]
apprehend
my surroundings.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.564
- Have you forgiven me?
- Forgiven him?

08:53.659 --> 08:56.696
I was turned down
for a fellowship here
at the institute.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.369
No, no, that is not true.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.572
Your anthropological
research was rejected...

09:01.667 --> 09:03.658
because it looked to
the past, not the future.

09:03.752 --> 09:07.210
[Speaking Latin]

09:07.297 --> 09:10.380
“To eternity, to glory,
to the future.”

09:10.467 --> 09:13.459
Right. Then why say your motto
in a dead, ancient language?

09:13.554 --> 09:15.010
Okay, Booth.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.050
How can I help you?
Uh, this—

09:17.141 --> 09:20.554
Uh, put your hand out.
I’ll— There you go.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.644
What Agent Booth
has given you—
I know what it is.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.642
It’s a piece of my meteorite.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.439
That’s impressive for a blind man.

09:27.568 --> 09:31.026
I know because I had it
made for Diane.
Diane?

09:31.113 --> 09:33.695
Dr. Diane Sidman, my fiancée.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.194
The meteorite was set
in her engagement ring.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.448
- Well, that would explain the gold flecks.
- Is Diane all right?

09:39.580 --> 09:42.617
When was the last time
you saw Diane?
A few days ago.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.700
She was ill, which is
understandable considering
the pressure she’s under.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.498
Pressure.
She’s editor-in-chief
of the C o/lar journal

09:48.589 --> 09:52.753
Perhaps the most important venue
for scientific publishing in
the world. What has happened?

09:52.843 --> 09:57.758
We have discovered
some human remains
which contained...

09:57.848 --> 10:00.840
what is most certainly
your fiancée’s engagement ring.

10:04.146 --> 10:07.730
[Clicking]

10:14.156 --> 10:17.990
We ’d like to talk to anyone
who may have interacted with
Diane before she disappeared

10:18.076 --> 10:22.035
Speak with Diane’s students,
chiefamong them Jennifer
Keating and Milton Alvaredo.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.159
I’ll have Dr. Beaudette
bring them to you.

10:25.250 --> 10:29.289
Oh. Well—
Ifyou need anything else,
I’ll be in my office.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.751
My God.
Dr. Sidman is dead?

10:33.842 --> 10:36.754
We have not yet made
a positive identification.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.757
When was the last time
you saw her, Milton?

10:39.848 --> 10:42.464
I suffer from a kind of
chronological dyslexia...

10:42.559 --> 10:47.474
which makes it very difficult
for me to place discreet events
accurately on a linear timeline.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.475
Whew!
This one’s all yours.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.477
What, exactly,
are you working on?

10:51.568 --> 10:55.481
I’m endeavoring to find a way to
transmit single-cell organisms,
using common pond scum,

10:55.572 --> 10:57.483
from one location
to another.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.485
Ever try a spoon?

10:59.576 --> 11:02.409
I’ve had some success
vibrating two separate samples
of single-cell scum...

11:02.496 --> 11:04.407
in complete symmetry
at a quantum level.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.409
That’s very impressive.
You wouldn’t understand,
Booth.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.537
Of course I do.
Beam me up, Scotty.
Very good.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.164
Yes, exactly.

11:11.255 --> 11:13.667
Dr. Sidman must have been eager
to publish that in thejournal.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.339
Very excited, yes,
pending a few questions.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.384
- Is this publishing thing important?
- Publish or perish.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.883
- I mean, is it motive?
- For a murder, you mean? Definitely.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.757
Definitely.
But only on the level
of vengeance.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.763
Killing her would not
reverse the decision,

11:26.854 --> 11:30.767
unless, of course, the person who killed her
wanted to take over her position.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.646
I last saw Diane when jennifer
asked us to stop arguing so loudly.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.941
Jennifer Keating,
Dr. Sidman’s other grad student?
Yes.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.990
Jenny works in
cosmogenic isotope research.
It can make her cranky.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.746
This place is making me cranky.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.413
I asked Milton
to quiet down, not Diane.

11:52.546 --> 11:56.789
I would never
get mad at Diane.
Why?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.715
She’s editor-in-chief ofthejournal.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.259
Publish or perish. Right?

12:01.346 --> 12:04.838
- What were they arguing about?
- I have no idea. Could’ve been about anything.

12:04.933 --> 12:09.472
Landis encourages
a free exchange of ideas,
and it can get pretty Intense.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.179
You specialize in
cosmogenic isotope research?

12:12.274 --> 12:13.810
“Cosmogenic”?

12:13.901 --> 12:17.314
It’s a new way
ofdating artifacts
using 14-C isotopes.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.895
Through accelerated
mass spectroscopy.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.901
Oh. That’d make me
cranky too.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.359
I can’t imagine that your project
excited Diane Sidman.

12:25.454 --> 12:28.446
Veni Vidi V/c/I
Look to the future.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.452
Carbon-dating
is all about the past.

12:31.543 --> 12:36.378
You’re right. There was no way
she was gonna publish me.

12:36.465 --> 12:39.207
This time next year, I’ll be looking
for postgraduate work.

12:39.301 --> 12:43.089
- Is that the last time
you saw Diane Sidman?
- Yes. Three days ago.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.136
Why? Is something wrong?

12:45.223 --> 12:47.509
It is possible that she is dead.

12:51.563 --> 12:56.398
Bones account for
approximately 15% ofthe mass
ofa human being.

12:56.485 --> 13:00.774
Given that the total bone mass
here comes to 8.9 kilograms,

13:00.864 --> 13:04.197
that would suggest
a human being who weighed
approximately...

13:04.284 --> 13:08.277
59.3333333 kilograms.

13:08.372 --> 13:12.456
One hundred and 31 pounds.
Well, that matches
the victim’s stats.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.453
[ I/incent]
Oh, it’s Diane Sidman, all r/ght.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.752
Dr. Saroyan got D. N.A. confirmation.

13:17.839 --> 13:22.253
There are no other particulates
outside ofthe gold flecks
and meteorite.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.050
What did I tell you?

13:30.227 --> 13:34.391
That we aren’t allowed
in the same room
without supervision.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.767
Why?

13:38.068 --> 13:39.979
Because we were
stupid enough...

13:40.070 --> 13:42.026
to fire a— a cannon indoors.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.480
And?

13:44.574 --> 13:48.283
You know, you’re here,
which— which counts
for supervision, so—

13:48.370 --> 13:49.735
FHleave.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.833
There’s a deep pitting
in these bones,

13:56.920 --> 13:59.957
which may or may not be
connected to the fractures.

14:00.048 --> 14:03.632
- Also, I excluded wood chipper
as a possibility.
- How?

14:03.719 --> 14:07.928
Whirling blades
would create parallel and
evenly-spaced fractures.

14:08.015 --> 14:12.429
These patterns appear
to be completely random.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.852
Even more puzzling,
they are unusually clean.

14:15.939 --> 14:21.900
What ifthe cellular damage
and the fractures were caused
by the same thing?

14:21.987 --> 14:26.356
The cells could have burst
as a result of ice microcrystals...

14:26.450 --> 14:29.362
having formed ifthe body
was rap/d/y frozen.

14:29.453 --> 14:32.160
You mean, freeze the body
and then shatter the bones.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.659
Liquid nitrogen?

14:39.087 --> 14:42.671
You have my permission
to confer with Dr. Hodgins
on the subject.

14:42.758 --> 14:46.091
Oh, uh, in the same room,
yes?

14:46.178 --> 14:49.466
-Just to be clear.
- Any damages come out ofyour pay.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.674

14:53.769 --> 14:56.727
As requested,
Diane’s work area.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.976
[Whistles] Wow.
Looks like somebody
cleaned it out.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.559
Oh, no, Booth.
Dr. Sidman was
a theoretical physicist.

15:03.653 --> 15:07.316
She didn’t do experiments.
She figured everything out
through equations.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.649
Diane was a member
ofthe Large Hadron
Collider team.

15:10.744 --> 15:15.283
Isn’t that that thing in Europe
that’s gonna create a black hole
and end the universe?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.989
There’s only
a very small chance ofthat
actually occurring.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.827
And yet Diane received
a number ofdeath threats.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.084
Diane Sidman’s role
was important to the
Large Hadron Collider team?

15:24.174 --> 15:26.540
The effort to find the Higgs boson
will be set back months.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.092
- The God particle.
- What’s that?

15:29.179 --> 15:32.137
Uh, a theoretical particle
which explains why matter has mass.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.010
Mass and matter
aren’t the same?

15:34.142 --> 15:36.349
[ Ch uckles ]
Don ’t look at each other
like that.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.018
I bet neither one ofyou know
how to make your own beer.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.722
You realize you just said
“Don’t look at each other”
to a blind man.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.103
Do you have records
ofthreats made against her?

15:44.194 --> 15:47.561
Yes, ever since one of
our scientists was attacked
for his work in cloning.

15:47.656 --> 15:51.023
Milton Alvaredo suggested
that we look at whoever was
going to replace Diane Sidman...

15:51.118 --> 15:53.029
as editor-in-chief.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.283
That would be the senior scholar,
Christopher Beaudette.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.035
You can understand how
that makes him a suspect.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.960
I’ll tell Sweets to look
into the threats and see if
they’re worth following up.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.880
Ifit matters,
Diane and Christopher were also
enjoying a sexual relationship.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.880
Whoa! “/f it matters”?
/ thought you were
going to marry her.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.882
At which time,
by mutual agreement,

16:12.973 --> 16:16.261
Diane and Christopher’s
sexual relationship was to cease.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.592
Completely rational.

It’s a good thing they didn’t
accept you at that place.
Why?

16:34.578 --> 16:36.569
It’s creepy.
Everyone there is creepy.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.621
Well, ifyou think
they’re creepy, then you
must think I’m creepy.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.245
Well, you have
a creepy mode, Bones.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.883

16:55.390 --> 16:59.884
He freely admits that he had
an ongoing sexual relationship
with the victim.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.889
Oh!

17:01.980 --> 17:03.936
That little brain.

17:04.024 --> 17:07.608
But he denies ever having
been “in love” with her.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.357
- What’s with the hooked fingers?
- Well, he said “in love” very sarcastically.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.155
Like it was something that
happened to “lower primates.”

17:14.242 --> 17:16.233
Okay, who else
was he sleeping with?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.118
- I didn’t ask.
- What does that matter?

17:19.206 --> 17:23.700
Because maybe not everybody is
so, you know, “adult,” you know,

17:23.793 --> 17:26.284
or “rational”...

17:27.297 --> 17:29.583
or— hey— “clear-thinking”...

17:29.674 --> 17:31.665
or “heartless” as him.

17:53.198 --> 17:56.315

who was also seeing Milton.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.869
So, is it poss/b/e that jennifer
was try/ng to get rid of
a roman t/c rival?

18:00.956 --> 18:02.787
By that retrograde
manner ofthought,

18:02.874 --> 18:05.616

for sleeping with me.

way too much.

sees himselfas Dr. Nemo.

18:40.412 --> 18:44.280

18:46.751 --> 18:49.993
or minus 346 degrees

18:50.088 --> 18:52.420
It’s, uh, unnecessary
to say “degrees Celsius.”

not super-cooled.

20:18.927 --> 20:22.715
Welding is a realjob,
unlike psychology.

20:22.806 --> 20:27.766
How can a reasonable human being
with a physics degree honestly believe...

20:27.852 --> 20:31.765
that a particle accelerator in Europe
is going to create a black hole...

20:31.856 --> 20:34.939

Would you like a list
of Nobel Laureates

20:41.241 --> 20:44.108
Too high when you consider
the loss of not only humanity,

that we know for certain...

20:47.205 --> 20:49.662

706 of them were from you.

The way that English people

“G-demolish,”

and it sounded pretty bad.

23:20.650 --> 23:24.188
The blues is known
as the devil’s music
because those most adept...

23:24.279 --> 23:28.318
are thought to have made
a pact with the devil
and thus fear no earthly law...

could very well be
the result ofa tumor.

24:06.821 --> 24:09.483

of Diane Sidman’s leukemia.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.781
A tumor this size
over two weeks...

24:11.868 --> 24:17.033
would require
a radiation source of between
1,000 and 5,000 rems.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.159
That would’ve burned the victim.
We would’ve seen that.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.866
Must have been
a steady exposure over time.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.953

24:58.873 --> 25:00.659
This stain here...

25:00.750 --> 25:05.995

You may be wondering
why I’m going through
these bones again.

25:34.200 --> 25:39.115

that Dr. Brennan found evidence
ofa tumor that you missed?

The discoloration in the fabric
was not radioactive,

I tested for daughter isotopes.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.358
Daughter isotopes?

26:14.449 --> 26:18.783
Daughter isotopes
are what’s left behind after
radioactive isotopes decay.

26:18.870 --> 26:22.704
So there was a radioactive isotope
on Diane Sidman’s chair.

26:22.790 --> 26:26.248

37:13.565 --> 37:16.477
Okay, sweet girl.

37:16.568 --> 37:20.186
I will ameliorate
my vengeful intentions.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.362
“Ameliorate”?

37:22.449 --> 37:24.189
Honest?

37:25.452 --> 37:27.238
Honest.

37:27.329 --> 37:30.321
Honest
as a Texas sundown.

37:42.803 --> 37:44.714
[Brennan]
One of you killed Diane Sidman.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.716
And tried
to kill us.

37:46.807 --> 37:49.719
I think we can rule out
sexual jealousy as a motive
for this murder.

37:49.810 --> 37:52.517
- [All]
Of course we can.
-Yeah, ofcourse we can.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.469
Why? Because these robots
don’t feel like humans?

37:54.565 --> 37:58.808
No, because radiation poisoning
is the opposite ofa crime of passion.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.565
Well, m y people say
that Diane S/dman was
stabbed to death with a pencil

38:02.656 --> 38:06.114
Well, indicating that the murderer
suddenly became impatient...

38:06.201 --> 38:08.112
or approached a deadline.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.660
You figure out that deadline,
you’ll ﬁgure out your murderer.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.454
It has to be
the publishing deadline
from thejournal.

38:13.542 --> 38:17.330
t ook at this, huh?
Found blood in your
resonance chamber.

38:17.463 --> 38:21.297
Obviously you can’t see that,
but it’s right there.
That’s not blood.

38:21.383 --> 38:24.921
- Luminol means blood.
- There’s no evidence ofsmearing.

38:25.012 --> 38:27.219
Ifthe murderer had seen blood,
he would’ve cleaned it up.

38:27.306 --> 38:30.719
Luminol reacts with copper,
iron, peroxides and cyanide.

38:30.809 --> 38:35.269
Which provides for
a number of false positives—
vegetables, fruit pulp.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.062
Cleaning agents, insecticides.

38:38.150 --> 38:42.234
Various glues, rust remover,
ketchup, seaweed, staph, algae.

38:42.321 --> 38:45.484
Is this luminol stuff
ever useful?

38:45.574 --> 38:50.068
I’mjust asking because it—
Yes? It is? Fine, I’ll shut up.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.993
Mm-hmm.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.038
- Booth.
- What?

38:55.125 --> 38:57.116
Luminol reacts
with pond scum.

38:57.211 --> 38:59.702
So?

38:59.796 --> 39:02.082
Right!

39:02.174 --> 39:04.130
Right.

39:04.218 --> 39:07.255
Pond scum Scotty
You ’re our gu y

39:07.346 --> 39:09.211
You’re under arrest.

39:09.348 --> 39:12.681
Knew it all along.
Let’s go. Come on. Up.
[Clicking]

39:12.768 --> 39:14.850
[Groans]
God! Oww!

39:14.937 --> 39:16.928
That’s for killing my fiancée.

39:17.022 --> 39:20.856
One person to your left,
Dr. Collar.

39:23.445 --> 39:27.779
My apologies, Agent Booth.
My echo locator
must have malfunctioned.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.652
[Clears Throat]

39:29.743 --> 39:33.952
This may not be
the most appropo time, but—

39:34.039 --> 39:36.121
- Oh! Here we go!
- Here we go, what?

39:36.208 --> 39:39.120
/ was wonder/ng,
could / ha ve your phone number?

39:39.211 --> 39:41.293
- Wow!
- Told you.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.711
ReaHy?

39:42.798 --> 39:46.290
I have been... considering
how to respond...

39:46.385 --> 39:48.216
ifyou asked...

39:48.303 --> 39:50.919
and have dec/ded upon no.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.425
- Well—
- I can go, right?

39:53.517 --> 39:57.180
- Yep.
- I have actual “save the world”
work to do.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.681
Dr. Collar.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.273
[Groaning]

40:03.402 --> 40:05.438
You okay?
Yeah, I’m all right.

40:05.529 --> 40:08.362
You know what?
You’re the only smart person
I really like.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.822
Th a n k yo u.
Oh, that’s—
W- What about—

40:10.909 --> 40:13.116
What about me?

40:17.332 --> 40:22.577
So, Diane Sidman agreed
to publish Milton Alvaredo only
ifhe shared credit with her.

40:22.671 --> 40:26.880
Right. She said that
he was using his theories
about the God particles—

40:27.009 --> 40:29.341
Particle.
There’s only one.
Right. Particle.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.293
To vibrate
the pond scum.

40:31.430 --> 40:35.298
He gives her cancer,
but she lives too long.
Wow. Yeah.

40:35.392 --> 40:38.304
Then he kills her with a pencil
and feeds her to crows...

40:38.395 --> 40:40.761
so he doesn’t have to
share a credit.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.892
Wow, that is cold.

40:42.983 --> 40:45.474
And creepy?

40:46.987 --> 40:50.150
I didn’t mean
to call you creepy.
You said I have a creepy mode.

40:50.240 --> 40:54.028
I apologize. Okay, look,
I wasn’t in my element.

40:54.161 --> 40:57.073
Every element is your element.
No, that is not true.

40:57.164 --> 40:59.029
Okay, listen,

40:59.124 --> 41:01.957
wejust gotta stop
hanging out with geniuses,

41:02.044 --> 41:05.002
because you’re gonna figure out
that I’m really stupid.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.170
What?
Don’t worry about that.

41:07.299 --> 41:11.633
Mmm.
I figured out a long time ago
how stupid you are.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.927
Hmm.

41:14.014 --> 41:17.427
What Ijust said... is true,

41:17.517 --> 41:21.430
and yet it really...
sounded wrong.

41:21.521 --> 41:25.730
What I should say is,
I don’t care how stupid you are.

41:28.362 --> 41:29.772
That’s not any better.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.525
No. No.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.990
Not at all.
It’s not even rel—
Okay, well—

41:35.077 --> 41:38.319
There is intelligence,
which I have
and Mr. Nigel-Murray.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.028
Oh. Thank you.

41:40.123 --> 41:45.789
And Sweets, even though
his is so misdirected
as to be meaningless.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.833
Right.
Wow. Backhand full of knuckles
with that compliment.

41:48.924 --> 41:52.041
And Hodgins. And Angela—

41:53.428 --> 41:55.840
Not so much,
but she’s very talented.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.224
Thank you very much.
You’re welcome.

41:58.308 --> 42:02.472
Then there’s another quality,
which is the ability
to use intelligence.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.553
That is what you have.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.899
Thanks, Bones.

42:09.986 --> 42:14.901
Hey, wait a minute,
speaking of Hodgins,
has anybody seen Hodgins?

42:16.034 --> 42:18.195
No.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.277
Oh, God.

42:22.165 --> 42:25.657
