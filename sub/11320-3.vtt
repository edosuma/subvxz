WEBVTT

00:23.648 --> 00:24.649
What do you want?

00:24.941 --> 00:25.942
Did you regret

00:26.317 --> 00:27.444
declining the offer?

00:27.861 --> 00:28.987
Yes.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.655
What do I need to do first?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.408
Do we start with the marriage license?

00:34.284 --> 00:35.660
We should draw up the contract first.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.413
How much do you want?

00:40.331 --> 00:41.332
Tell me.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.376
How much do you want?

00:45.545 --> 00:46.546
Give me a lot.

00:50.049 --> 00:53.011
Enough to use
until my daughter grows up...

00:55.513 --> 00:56.931
and can survive on her own.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.353
Okay.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.522
I'll give you plenty.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.524
We don't have time,

01:07.025 --> 01:08.568
so let's get you tested since you're here.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.322
Let's check and see whether or not
you're a match with my mom.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.783
If you pass the tests,

01:16.159 --> 01:17.827
you just have to do as I say.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.625
Clench your fist.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.461
Hello.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.380
Don't get too nervous.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.216
The test isn't hard to pass.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.386
What's your relationship with the person
receiving the transplant?

01:35.929 --> 01:36.930
Are you her daughter?

01:37.764 --> 01:38.973
-Pardon?
-No.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.767
She's my wife.

01:41.017 --> 01:41.935
I see.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.229
You're her daughter-in-law.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.023
Goodness.
You've made a difficult decision.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.986
HEART NAIL

01:52.195 --> 01:56.282
Gosh. How nice would it be
if all these nail clippings were money?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.410
My gosh. A new nail salon opens up

01:59.577 --> 02:01.246
every single day.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.415
Everyone is doing nails for a living.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.377
They're trying to kill me.

02:11.422 --> 02:12.340
Gosh.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.008
Give it to me.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.261
Rest up. I'll finish here.

02:16.594 --> 02:19.430
Every single muscle aches.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.476
Want a massage?

02:24.727 --> 02:26.312
It's okay.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.275
I'm really going to bed.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.070
Are you sleepy, Eun-seong?

02:34.195 --> 02:35.405
Want to go in with me?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.824
It's okay. Go in.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.325
Okay.

02:44.747 --> 02:45.748
Eun-seong.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.376
I'll do well.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.879
I'll do well.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.923
So let's live a long, healthy life

02:55.091 --> 02:56.092
full of happiness.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.636
Okay?

03:05.059 --> 03:06.185
Sorry that I kept you waiting.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.440
Your guardian didn't come with you?

03:14.569 --> 03:15.570
Doctor.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.531
Can I postpone my treatment
for a few months?

03:19.657 --> 03:21.034
Postpone the treatment?

03:21.117 --> 03:23.494
You said it's still in the early stages,
and I have no symptoms yet.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.830
I have no guardian

03:26.664 --> 03:28.333
and can't afford the treatment.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.793
I understand, but--

03:30.877 --> 03:32.462
I'm going to come back
after I can afford it.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.505
I'll get treated.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.008
I'm going to live.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.596
That's why I'm delaying it.
Just for a short while.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.290
Have a seat.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.392
It's an advance.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.685
As for the rest,

04:28.935 --> 04:30.603
I'll give it to you after the surgery.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.563
The test--

04:32.689 --> 04:33.690
As for the test,

04:34.691 --> 04:35.692
you passed.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.696
There weren't any problems?

04:40.196 --> 04:41.906
No. There are no problems with you

04:42.532 --> 04:43.783
donating your liver.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.204
What is it?

04:48.621 --> 04:49.622
Do you have more questions?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.541
No.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.128
I'm glad there aren't any problems.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.171
It's too soon to relax.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.258
We need to prove to the hospital

05:00.675 --> 05:02.719
that you are really family,

05:02.969 --> 05:04.387
and not someone I paid.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.182
They need to make sure,
since these things happen.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.647
I told you over and over
that you'll need to be strong.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.276
Don't worry.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.862
I'm ready for much more

05:22.030 --> 05:23.239
than you think I am.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.493
If things go wrong
because of your mistake,

05:29.495 --> 05:30.747
you must return the money.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.248
Of course,

05:32.915 --> 05:35.168
it'll be different if it's my fault.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.627
Do you agree?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.465
Yes.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.052
You need to eat more.

05:45.970 --> 05:46.971
Pardon?

05:47.263 --> 05:48.473
You're so skinny.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.974
Can you really get the surgery?

05:57.231 --> 05:58.232
Did you bring your seal?

05:58.733 --> 05:59.984
I'll handle the marriage license.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.741
Once the surgery is done,

06:07.241 --> 06:08.743
we can process the divorce.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.655
Here comes the bride.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.379
We'll have the groom choose.

07:01.546 --> 07:02.713
A flower crown or hair clip?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.050
Let's go with anything.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.011
The groom is too shy.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.931
I'll go with this one.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.391
Okay.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.401
Place your hand lightly on hers.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.777
Place your arm around her waist.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.362
Okay. Closer.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.530
That's good.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.491
Okay. One, two, three.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.161
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.329
Let's have one of you kissing.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.332
Come on.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.667
You do it all the time.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.670
Okay. Put your hands around her waist.

07:43.379 --> 07:44.380
Bride.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.675
A little closer. Closer.

07:47.758 --> 07:48.843
Get together.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.928
One, two, three.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.265
Yes.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.475
Smile. More.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.523
Did the hospital ask you
to submit these pictures too?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.401
Submitting proof is necessary.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.737
If we marry out of the blue,

08:08.196 --> 08:09.322
they'll suspect us for sure.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.699
We need to submit proof

08:12.450 --> 08:14.035
that I didn't buy an organ,

08:14.452 --> 08:16.287
but married you out of love.

08:16.829 --> 08:17.914
I'm going to say

08:18.206 --> 08:19.832
these photos were from a year ago.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.919
Let's say that's when we got
secretly engaged.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.421
I'm going to insist

08:25.963 --> 08:27.089
we got engaged in secret

08:27.924 --> 08:29.759
without telling the family
because my mom objected.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.887
Can you manipulate the photos
to make it look a year old?

08:34.388 --> 08:36.516
You don't need to worry about that.

08:36.974 --> 08:37.975
I'll take care of it.

08:39.769 --> 08:40.770
Okay.

08:42.855 --> 08:43.856
What are you doing tomorrow?

08:44.148 --> 08:45.483
I have to work.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.778
Return to the restaurant tomorrow.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.072
The restaurant?

08:51.822 --> 08:53.157
You need to stay near me for now.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.993
I can't trust you not to bail.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.088
Next is the hospital interview.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.589
You need to act well.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.508
It's over if they can tell it's fake.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.262
Place your hand on his shoulder.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.805
One, two.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.807
Stand behind him.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.850
Place your hands on his shoulders.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.103
One, two. Okay.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.063
Look at each other.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.649
Good. Okay.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.819
Give me a happy smile. Smile.

09:29.902 --> 09:30.987
Can't we speed this up?

09:31.779 --> 09:32.947
And why is it so hot in here?

09:49.463 --> 09:50.464
Ms. Oh.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.259
Your son is here.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.264
She won't say anything.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.851
Please excuse us.

10:01.934 --> 10:02.935
Okay.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.116
Stop scaring me.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.243
I'm a busy man.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.954
The ICU won't take visitors.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.664
Stop going there.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.791
Please...

10:28.002 --> 10:30.087
process my discharge.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.757
I want to go home.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.550
Not like this.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.969
Are you hiding a lover at home
or something?

10:37.803 --> 10:38.888
Don't tease me.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.848
I have no energy to fight.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.810
I know I don't have much time left.

10:46.896 --> 10:47.897
Let me go home

10:48.773 --> 10:49.774
and...

10:50.816 --> 10:53.611
finish things up before I go.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.363
Like what?

10:56.072 --> 10:58.282
Going to Dad and causing a scene?

11:02.119 --> 11:04.080
Sorry, but it won't go as you wish.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.792
I think I can get a donor.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.045
You need to eat well
and get stronger to get a transplant.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.130
You can't get the surgery in this state.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.093
Where did we get a donor?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.261
I'm far down on the list.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.389
You can always pull that up.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.724
Tell me.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.393
I'll explain later.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.395
Just do as I say.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.571
Where's the blanched broccoli?

11:37.655 --> 11:38.656
Coming.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.914
What got into Mr. Han?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.959
That cold-hearted jerk told you
to come back?

11:50.626 --> 11:51.627
I'm stunned.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.546
He's usually dying to fire people.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.923
What happened to him?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.174
Maybe

11:58.300 --> 11:59.427
she has connections.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.845
Go do your job.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.638
Okay.

12:11.730 --> 12:12.857
Hye-su.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.817
I heard from the manager.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.570
The company reconsidered
and let you come back?

12:18.863 --> 12:19.780
Well,

12:19.989 --> 12:21.115
I guess that's what happened.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.741
I'm surprised.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.118
I got lucky.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.829
Did you really pay the loan shark back?

12:29.039 --> 12:31.041
Yes, I did.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.418
You really did?

12:33.419 --> 12:34.420
How?

12:36.088 --> 12:38.257
Someone helped me. Don't worry about it.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.718
Is that true?

12:41.844 --> 12:42.970
Look me in the eye.

12:46.807 --> 12:47.808
It's true.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.226
This is my business.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.895
Don't worry about it.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.438
It was my cousin's debt.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.107
It's as much my business as it is yours.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.442
How could I not worry about it?

12:58.152 --> 12:59.153
Hye-su?

12:59.487 --> 13:00.404
Yes?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.156
Can I have a word with you?

13:05.242 --> 13:06.243
What are you doing here?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.999
Don't get any weird ideas.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.092
Hey.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.136
Do you still work with those tough guys?

13:25.429 --> 13:27.014
No, I just need some money.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.227
I don't care, as long as it's
the right amount.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.687
Seung-ju.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.190
Here.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.193
What could happen?
Worst case scenario, I'll die.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.196
It's urgent, so look into it for me.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.245
Seung-ju! Where are you going?

13:54.124 --> 13:55.125
Have a seat.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.509
Here.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.012
This is Mr. Han's profile
and personal information.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.514
Did you bring yours?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.225
Here you go.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.441
From now on,

14:20.150 --> 14:21.986
you two need to get your stories straight.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.321
You need to come up with a story
about your relationship

14:24.405 --> 14:27.032
and a reason why you pushed off the
marriage although you dated for so long.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.702
You guys need to make sure to be
on the same page for every little detail.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.413
If you want to look
like you were dating for a while,

14:32.746 --> 14:35.207
you need to know about each other's lives.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.501
Yes.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.546
Also,

14:41.505 --> 14:43.757
starting tonight, stay after work

14:44.133 --> 14:47.761
and begin studying hard with Mr. Han.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.305
Study?

14:49.513 --> 14:50.389
Gosh.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.435
Sloppy acting won't fool the hospital.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.979
They're experts.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.399
I heard they can tell right away
whether or not you're lying.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.401
Gosh.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.279
I'm more worried about Mr. Han though.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.697
He can't control his expressions.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.366
He always loses at poker
because he's always getting angry.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.577
Gosh.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.370
Anyway,

15:13.621 --> 15:15.247
memorize everything here. Okay?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.207
Hometown, age, school, hobbies,

15:18.626 --> 15:19.793
underwear size...

15:23.380 --> 15:26.008
I mean, you're his wife after all.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.145
-Good job today.
-You too, Hye-su.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.314
-Let's get drinks.
-No thank you.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.734
How is your mom nowadays?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.278
She's getting better.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.696
What about the hospital bill?

15:48.113 --> 15:49.698
We've paid off most of it.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.034
HAN JI-HUN'S PROFILE

15:57.081 --> 15:58.290
HOBBIES, SIZES

16:01.293 --> 16:03.087
What are you studying so intently?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.296
Let us see too.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.381
It's nothing.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.674
Let's all have some fun.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.886
"Born in Seoul in 1980.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.484
Hello.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.081
Let's go.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.545
What are you doing?

16:47.631 --> 16:49.633
Mr. Han, I have some questions.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.677
What's NYU?

16:52.219 --> 16:54.054
It says the university you went to is NYU.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.935
Did you graduate in the States?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.062
Then what's this?

17:07.067 --> 17:09.486
How could you read this here
in front of everyone?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.031
I mean, I just got it.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.616
I'm sorry.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.914
Gosh.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.768
It's so hard to see you these days.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.102
Are you that busy?

17:42.561 --> 17:43.562
Yes.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.273
How are preparations
for the second restaurant going?

17:46.565 --> 17:49.359
Yes. We should be able to open
in the first half of the year.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.737
I've narrowed it down to two places

17:52.154 --> 17:53.155
and I'm going over them.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.533
I know you're busy but make some time.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.787
She's Assemblyman Oh Sang-jin's daughter.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.247
She gives lectures at a university.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.333
She's ambitious and strong-willed.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.503
Very smart like her dad.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.923
She isn't an eyesore, either.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.051
I'm not interested in
getting married for a while.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.636
You've said that many times.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.098
Get married soon
after your brother's wedding.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.310
I won't be around forever.

18:25.562 --> 18:26.647
Your mom has been

18:27.523 --> 18:29.733
quiet lately.

18:30.734 --> 18:31.902
She hasn't called.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.613
That scares me more.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.700
I don't know what scheme she's cooking up.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.577
Don't worry.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.204
I talked to her.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.248
-Ji-hun.
-Yes.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.791
I'm glad you're here.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.794
Let's go. We'll be late.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.129
Are you going somewhere?

18:50.420 --> 18:51.505
Well,

18:52.005 --> 18:54.716
Na-yoon's recital is today.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.010
We may become a family soon.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.887
We should go and support her.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.140
Will you drive me?

19:01.974 --> 19:05.144
Why don't we go on a nice date?

19:06.061 --> 19:07.062
Okay.

19:11.984 --> 19:12.985
Ji-hun.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.070
I've been thinking.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.531
Why don't we get

19:18.448 --> 19:20.576
that woman to see a psychiatrist?

19:21.451 --> 19:23.370
She seems to need treatment.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.456
I'm genuinely concerned.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.419
It was over between her
and your dad ages ago.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.462
What's gotten into her lately?

19:34.882 --> 19:38.093
It's not like
I can't guess what she's up to.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.804
And she spends frivolously too.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.808
You poor thing.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.437
When I think

19:50.230 --> 19:52.316
about how she neglected you
when you were younger,

19:54.234 --> 19:56.028
it still makes me tear up.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.287
I made so many mistakes.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.122
Not at all.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.040
It was so beautiful.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.879
Oh, right.
These flowers are from the chairman.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.301
Wait.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.510
Where's Ji-hun?

21:43.885 --> 21:44.886
Did he go somewhere?

21:45.554 --> 21:46.805
He was just here.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.527
Hey, Jeong-hun.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.154
Something came up and I need to go.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.323
I'll call Mom later.

22:04.948 --> 22:05.949
Okay.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.910
Ji-hun, you came.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.832
Hi.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.834
I liked your recital.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.627
You haven't

22:18.337 --> 22:19.338
improved at all.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.427
Sorry, but I need to go.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.638
Don't avoid me.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.891
We'll have to keep seeing each other.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.563
You are still as cowardly
as you were then, Ji-hun.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.483
You ran away then,
and you're running away now.

22:40.358 --> 22:42.069
You'll run away all your life.

22:44.362 --> 22:46.281
Just tell them I'm your ex-girlfriend

22:46.782 --> 22:47.866
and ruin the wedding.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.411
You can't do that, can you?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.414
So how dare you act sarcastic to me?

23:01.922 --> 23:02.923
I'm leaving now.

23:11.389 --> 23:12.682
-You were here.
-Hey, Jeong-hun.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.103
Her recital was so moving.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.980
She was embarrassed by my compliment.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.024
Really?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.109
Yes.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.657
Why couldn't I reach you?

23:29.282 --> 23:30.283
I was at a recital.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.077
What an easy life.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.372
The hospital called
to schedule the interview.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.374
It's sooner than we expected.

23:37.833 --> 23:38.834
What should we do?

23:40.127 --> 23:41.128
Where's Hye-su?

23:41.253 --> 23:42.254
Hye-su?

23:43.547 --> 23:44.548
What?

23:45.799 --> 23:46.800
Hye-su!

23:46.967 --> 23:49.928
She was here not too long ago.

23:51.721 --> 23:52.722
Hye-su.

24:23.879 --> 24:24.880
Hello.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.047
What are you doing here?

24:26.798 --> 24:28.550
I was taking inventory.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.638
Why didn't you answer your phone?

24:34.764 --> 24:36.600
I must've left it downstairs.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.144
I told you to make sure
you can always answer your phone.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.063
Just stay

24:42.731 --> 24:44.232
at my place for a while.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.775
Sorry?

24:45.859 --> 24:47.152
I'll stay at my house.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.905
I may often need to consult
with you on short notice.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.364
So I need you to be nearby.

24:56.369 --> 24:57.370
Gosh.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.082
No.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.001
I don't need your place.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.047
Would you rent out that room to me?

25:08.924 --> 25:11.384
It used to be the employee lounge,
so it isn't bad.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.220
Here.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.771
It won't look good to the others

25:22.854 --> 25:25.065
if they find out I moved into your place.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.902
It has a sink and a bathroom.
I just need to clean it up.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.739
I've been looking for a place to live
with my child, anyway.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.000
Don't worry.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.169
I'll stay here until the surgery,

25:46.962 --> 25:48.672
right where you need me.

25:49.547 --> 25:50.924
I'll go down now.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.772
These are our engagement photos.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.274
We'll need to take

26:07.774 --> 26:09.276
a few more pictures for proof.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.486
Not like these, but more casual pictures.

26:12.195 --> 26:13.196
Okay.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.489
Burn them after the surgery.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.410
The recording has started.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.371
And here.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.541
These are possible questions
the hospital may ask us.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.462
We've been dating for two years.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.257
What were you doing two years ago?

26:33.008 --> 26:35.468
I worked at a restaurant
while studying for the chef's exam.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.846
Send me the name of the restaurant
where you worked

26:38.054 --> 26:39.180
and your address from back then.

26:41.683 --> 26:42.851
When did your husband die?

26:46.896 --> 26:49.232
He died in a car accident
the same year my child was born.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.859
Why are you in debt?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.736
Do you need to know that too?

26:53.903 --> 26:55.113
If we were dating for two years,

26:55.447 --> 26:57.449
I feel like I should know.

26:59.909 --> 27:00.910
But then again,

27:01.619 --> 27:03.997
we don't want the hospital to know
about the debt.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.292
Your parents?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.127
What do they do?

27:09.336 --> 27:11.629
They passed away early.
I lived with my grandmother.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.298
You've had a sad life.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.466
I did not.

27:14.924 --> 27:17.552
She was a doting grandmother
and I was happy.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.347
Don't get angry.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.349
I didn't say you had a bad life.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.520
Where did we meet?

27:29.147 --> 27:30.315
What should we say?

27:31.483 --> 27:32.484
A club?

27:32.942 --> 27:33.985
Have you been to any clubs?

27:34.235 --> 27:36.571
I doubt it, since my child is so young.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.533
Let's just say we met
after a car accident in front of a club.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.702
Let's say you hit me with your car.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.539
That's realistic.

27:46.664 --> 27:47.749
Nice. Let's go with that.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.837
"The most recent trip we took."

27:54.172 --> 27:55.840
Where should we say?

27:57.717 --> 27:58.718
Hawaii?

27:59.386 --> 28:00.387
Okinawa?

28:02.013 --> 28:03.014
Okay.

28:03.556 --> 28:04.557
Let's say Yongpyong.

28:04.724 --> 28:05.725
You've been there, right?

28:05.975 --> 28:08.645
Let's say we took a three-day ski trip
with your child last year.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.980
I'll send you my membership usage record.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.367
May I call Mom?

28:22.492 --> 28:23.868
No, you may not.

28:24.077 --> 28:27.038
You shouldn't call her when she's working.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.165
But she's getting off way too late.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.418
She said she'll be very late tonight.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.753
They're preparing for a big party.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.672
Still, it's too late.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.717
You're right.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.052
Maybe...

28:42.011 --> 28:43.972
your mom left you behind

28:44.389 --> 28:46.015
to go play somewhere fun.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.101
No way. She wouldn't do that.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.603
My mom isn't like you.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.439
What do you take me for?

28:52.605 --> 28:55.316
Who says your mom can't go somewhere fun?

29:00.739 --> 29:04.075
Maybe your mom left you and went far away.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.202
Gosh! What then?

29:06.327 --> 29:09.831
Then you'll have to live with me
for the rest of your life.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.667
I would love that

29:12.751 --> 29:15.378
because I love you so much.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.380
Right?

29:29.184 --> 29:32.395
Goodness, why is she so late?

29:45.074 --> 29:46.576
Thank you for the ride.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.204
People live here?

29:50.622 --> 29:51.790
It's my friend's shop.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.082
She's watching my child.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.003
I see.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.922
I won't run away.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.799
Don't worry.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.056
Press that

30:08.681 --> 30:09.808
and push the door.

30:10.975 --> 30:11.976
This?

30:18.775 --> 30:19.901
Good night.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.833
-You startled me.
-Hey.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.043
Who was that? What happened?

30:37.126 --> 30:38.837
The restaurant's director gave me a ride.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.176
Is she asleep?

30:46.302 --> 30:49.430
Why did your director drive you home?

30:50.473 --> 30:51.933
Because it was late.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.352
Wrong. That makes no sense.

30:54.477 --> 30:57.730
You weren't the only one working late,
so why did he drive just you home?

30:59.899 --> 31:02.443
He lives that way.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.863
I see. How kind of him.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.365
He fired you not long ago.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.449
Why is he doing this now?

31:09.784 --> 31:10.785
I know.

31:11.077 --> 31:13.204
Do you think he's interested in you?

31:14.539 --> 31:16.249
Oh my gosh.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.376
Think whatever you want.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.129
How romantic.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.213
Eun-seong.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.423
Let's go and sleep.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.592
You couldn't sleep
because you were waiting for me?

31:25.967 --> 31:27.010
What's this?

31:28.761 --> 31:30.054
-Don't touch it.
-My goodness.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.142
Gosh.

31:34.809 --> 31:35.810
Shut it.

31:36.185 --> 31:37.186
"Don't touch it."

31:37.270 --> 31:38.605
Eun-seong, let's go in.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.399
-Mom.
-Sorry.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.110
SEUNGJIN HOSPITAL

31:51.326 --> 31:53.077
You look much better.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.163
Thanks to you.

31:55.788 --> 31:58.917
It's so great
that you can get a transplant.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.003
Not many daughters-in-law
would do that nowadays.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.505
You're truly blessed.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.174
Daughter-in-law?

32:06.424 --> 32:09.385
Yes. I heard your daughter-in-law
is donating her liver to you.

32:09.844 --> 32:10.970
Isn't that it?

32:11.304 --> 32:12.931
But...

32:13.806 --> 32:14.807
Oh my...

32:15.099 --> 32:18.061
They didn't talk to me about it yet.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.812
I see.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.773
It wasn't decided yet?

32:23.232 --> 32:24.233
No.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.737
I haven't decided yet.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.781
Sure, I can understand.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.407
It's not an easy decision.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.046
What is it?

32:45.129 --> 32:46.506
Did you get married

32:46.923 --> 32:48.049
without telling me?

32:49.634 --> 32:50.635
What happened?

32:51.260 --> 32:52.261
Tell me.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.806
You must be better. You sound strong.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.976
What daughter-in-law?
I don't have a daughter-in-law.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.394
Did you get married?

32:59.519 --> 33:01.562
How else would you have a daughter-in-law?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.272
What do you mean?

33:03.439 --> 33:04.440
I'm busy.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.526
I'll explain later at the hospital.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.904
Don't ask around.

33:10.947 --> 33:11.948
Hello.

33:14.409 --> 33:15.410
Just pray

33:15.827 --> 33:17.203
and be thankful you can live.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.675
Ta-da!

33:34.178 --> 33:35.513
Here you go!

33:35.763 --> 33:38.641
I brought you your favorite. Red roses.

33:40.059 --> 33:41.477
The color of passion.

33:41.561 --> 33:42.895
The scent.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.816
They look just like you!

33:48.568 --> 33:51.612
And a nice sweater for the spring!

33:52.113 --> 33:53.322
Tell me the truth.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.366
Everything you know.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.119
Pardon? What do you mean?

33:58.202 --> 34:00.538
I don't know anything.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.123
There's no way.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.125
I can tell from your face.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.335
I really don't know.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.256
Please calm down.

34:10.339 --> 34:12.300
If you stay upset like this,

34:12.675 --> 34:14.260
you're going to make yourself sicker.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.888
Tell me. Tell me everything.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.349
Since when did I have a daughter-in-law?

34:20.725 --> 34:21.726
Since when?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.896
Who on earth did he marry?

34:26.355 --> 34:28.524
Well, the thing is...

34:30.193 --> 34:32.528
What are you talking about?

34:33.112 --> 34:35.364
Ji-hun isn't married.

34:35.448 --> 34:38.284
He freaks out at the mention of marriage.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.870
He won't even go to our friends' weddings.

34:40.953 --> 34:41.996
Then tell me.

34:42.622 --> 34:45.291
What is this about my daughter-in-law
donating her liver?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.835
Is the nurse mistaken?

34:49.087 --> 34:50.379
The thing is...

34:50.505 --> 34:51.798
That is...

34:52.548 --> 34:53.549
Well...

34:53.966 --> 34:56.803
I'll need to talk to Ji-hun first.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.139
Anyway, you need to relax.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.307
Who is she?

35:01.766 --> 35:02.767
What is she like?

35:03.476 --> 35:04.644
I'll ask the hospital then.

35:04.727 --> 35:05.812
Wait!

35:05.978 --> 35:07.897
Please wait.

35:11.734 --> 35:13.986
The truth is...

35:15.488 --> 35:18.449
He met her while he was studying abroad.

35:18.783 --> 35:22.370
They ran into each other
about two years ago.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.205
However,

35:25.957 --> 35:28.000
her husband passed away

35:28.292 --> 35:29.669
and she had a child,

35:30.545 --> 35:33.798
so he couldn't tell you about her.

35:37.009 --> 35:39.554
I think they're really in love!

35:39.679 --> 35:41.556
And she has such a kind heart.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.349
She's willing to do the surgery for you.

35:43.432 --> 35:45.935
Gosh, and she happens to be
a perfect match.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.478
She's a nice girl.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.566
You'll see.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.528
Isn't it nice?

35:55.653 --> 35:58.781
It has a nice view
and it's close to my work.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.199
Yes. I love it.

36:02.451 --> 36:03.494
Mister!

36:07.874 --> 36:09.876
-Hi, Eun-seong.
-Hello.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.087
I'll do it. Go down.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.172
Why?

36:14.672 --> 36:16.257
-What's going on?
-I'll be right down.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.927
-How have you been?
-Good.

36:26.684 --> 36:27.810
No, Eun-seong.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.689
-Thanks.
-What's going on?

36:32.398 --> 36:34.025
You got your job back
and you're staying here?

36:34.692 --> 36:36.402
Mr. Han isn't like that.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.905
I begged him.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.324
I told him I had nowhere else to go
and to let me stay here.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.243
That jerk doesn't care
about things like that.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.830
They dock your pay
even if you step out for a bit.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.832
He's trying to kiss up to his dad,

36:50.082 --> 36:51.709
so he lives here

36:51.918 --> 36:53.920
and only pretends to work.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.797
Everyone says he's garbage.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.717
He must be after something.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.888
Maybe I have something on him.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.556
Something on him? Like what?

37:06.641 --> 37:08.392
I would lose my hold over him
if I told you.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.520
Bring me that. Those plates are heavy.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.859
So cute.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.532
Look at that wiggly tail.

37:26.702 --> 37:28.663
I said everything you told me to,

37:29.080 --> 37:32.250
but why don't you just tell your mom
that it's a fake marriage?

37:34.168 --> 37:35.169
Are you stupid?

37:36.629 --> 37:38.047
What do you think will happen?

37:38.798 --> 37:40.549
If I say I'm getting married
for her transplant,

37:40.633 --> 37:41.634
would she agree to it?

37:43.552 --> 37:45.721
My marriage is everything to her.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.390
It'll only complicate things.

37:47.556 --> 37:48.557
You're right.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.643
She would freak out.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.395
The fewer people who know, the better.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.481
Still, things keep getting
more complicated.

37:55.564 --> 37:56.691
What do you plan to do?

37:56.774 --> 37:58.359
It will be problem after problem.

37:58.442 --> 38:01.696
I wouldn't say anything
if you had passed the hospital interview.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.907
Gosh. I hear they are super tough.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.160
What is that noise?

38:08.244 --> 38:09.412
Where's it coming from?

38:19.130 --> 38:20.589
Who said you could jump rope here?

38:24.677 --> 38:25.678
Goodness.

38:26.178 --> 38:27.471
Kid, don't you hear me?

38:29.932 --> 38:31.434
I said, stop jumping!

38:32.601 --> 38:33.811
It's so hot.

38:33.978 --> 38:34.979
Stop, Eun-seong.

38:43.487 --> 38:44.488
The two of you

38:44.864 --> 38:46.198
seem close.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.745
This is no longer the employee lounge.

38:50.870 --> 38:51.912
It's Hye-su's home,

38:52.496 --> 38:54.457
so please don't go in anymore.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.209
Don't cause trouble.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.211
-But Mr. Han--
-Go down.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.761
Train the employees properly.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.430
That lazy bum.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.359
Kid, would you stop?

39:24.945 --> 39:26.947
My goodness! Eun-seong!

39:28.908 --> 39:29.909
Are you okay?

39:33.079 --> 39:34.997
Gross. You're a weird old man.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.667
-Oh my.
-Hey!

39:38.793 --> 39:40.086
-That brat.
-I'll wipe that.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.712
Take it off. I will--

39:41.837 --> 39:43.422
-Take off what?
-I'm sorry.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.299
Hye-su, we need to talk.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.344
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.596
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.522
Make sure she stops jumping.

40:00.314 --> 40:01.440
It's distracting. I can't work.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.442
I'll tell her.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.362
I hate kids running around.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.824
I didn't stop you,
since you insisted on moving in here,

40:10.741 --> 40:12.785
but if the kid goes downstairs
and hinders business,

40:12.868 --> 40:13.911
or runs around near my room,

40:15.121 --> 40:16.622
you'll have to move out.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.416
Okay.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.460
Can't you send the kid
to your in-laws or somewhere?

40:22.128 --> 40:23.546
Must you live with her?

40:24.547 --> 40:27.299
I'm saying this because you insist on
living with her when you're in such debt.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.634
It makes you look foolish.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.221
I guess that's why

40:32.721 --> 40:33.848
your husband's debt is yours.

40:34.515 --> 40:35.808
You're right. I'm foolish.

40:36.308 --> 40:38.144
That's why I'm selling my liver.

40:46.735 --> 40:47.736
Are you kidding me?

40:48.654 --> 40:49.655
Don't tell me

40:50.114 --> 40:51.824
you say things like that to others.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.617
Are you always that loud?

40:54.618 --> 40:56.287
This isn't a game.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.747
This is a conspiracy to commit a crime.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.753
This is why I want you
where I can see you.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.505
I just can't trust you.

41:07.089 --> 41:09.758
Do you know how dangerous
things are going to get?

41:10.176 --> 41:12.261
Did you memorize the possible questions

41:12.803 --> 41:13.804
for the hospital interview?

41:14.138 --> 41:15.139
Yes.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.107
Here.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.902
This is what to say to my mom.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.445
For her,

41:30.112 --> 41:32.698
we need to change your background a bit.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.825
Do we need to lie to your mom too?

41:36.660 --> 41:39.205
Just keep to the script
until the surgery is over.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.916
If you don't,
it'll only make life harder for you.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.418
I'll do my best

41:44.585 --> 41:47.213
and explain why you're raising a kid alone
and how your husband passed away,

41:49.006 --> 41:50.549
but I had to change your educational

41:50.925 --> 41:52.009
and family background a bit.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.886
The fact that you were raised
in a broken family

41:54.011 --> 41:55.679
and are a widow with a kid

41:56.138 --> 41:57.848
is enough to make my mom freak out.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.393
If we don't lie about all of this,
she'd refuse the surgery.

42:01.852 --> 42:04.688
This is all because I'm worried about you.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.401
What is it?

42:09.860 --> 42:10.861
Do you have a problem?

42:11.237 --> 42:12.404
Mr. Han.

42:12.821 --> 42:13.781
What is it?

42:13.864 --> 42:15.699
I know you're very prejudiced,

42:16.867 --> 42:18.702
but please have some manners.

42:19.954 --> 42:23.123
I don't like the way you talk about my
background and how I'm a widow with a kid.

42:23.666 --> 42:24.792
You're quite snappish.

42:25.709 --> 42:26.835
You didn't look like it.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.129
You're the one who's messed up.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.506
What?

42:30.589 --> 42:31.590
You know,

42:31.840 --> 42:34.218
I've done all sorts of things
to survive with a kid

42:34.343 --> 42:35.761
and pay back my debt.

42:36.470 --> 42:38.597
I've sold street food illegally

42:39.014 --> 42:40.766
and sold counterfeits.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.685
I've lent someone my identity

42:42.893 --> 42:45.187
for some strange company, for money.

42:46.730 --> 42:47.982
I've done all sorts of illegal

42:48.440 --> 42:49.858
and dangerous things.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.862
-So?
-This isn't easy for me, either.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.114
I am

42:56.031 --> 42:57.825
putting my life on the line.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.411
Why are you acting so weak now?

43:01.036 --> 43:02.621
The surgery won't kill you.

43:16.969 --> 43:18.429
The chef is looking for me.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.056
I'll talk to you later.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.233
Don't worry too much.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.068
Pardon?

43:33.277 --> 43:34.903
Weren't you with Mr. Han just now?

43:36.113 --> 43:37.740
He has a thing for abusing people.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.158
He wants you to work hard, right?

43:40.326 --> 43:41.327
Yes.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.329
Tell him to look in the mirror.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.999
He knows nothing about cooking,
but he acts like he's all that.

43:47.708 --> 43:48.917
What a complete idiot.

43:51.253 --> 43:52.254
Don't you think so?

43:52.630 --> 43:53.756
Yes, a little.

43:55.674 --> 43:57.468
He should tone it down.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.219
Who cares if he's the director?

43:59.345 --> 44:00.679
That young punk

44:00.929 --> 44:02.389
bosses everyone around.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.476
I guess money is everything.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.063
What?

44:09.563 --> 44:10.564
What?

44:15.736 --> 44:17.029
Still,

44:17.112 --> 44:20.282
we get paid a salary,
so we need to be understanding.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.326
That's the way to survive.

44:25.287 --> 44:26.497
You should've said something.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.696
And that guy

45:00.531 --> 45:02.991
was the big brother of Jung-woo's mom.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.619
He thought he was...

45:06.036 --> 45:07.538
Sorry, Eun-seong.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.501
Open wide.

45:13.001 --> 45:14.128
Chew well.

45:15.170 --> 45:17.506
And I gave him a watch as a gift.

45:17.589 --> 45:18.632
What are you doing?

45:19.174 --> 45:20.676
What? Nothing.

45:20.759 --> 45:21.760
It's nothing.

45:22.594 --> 45:23.595
Aren't you hungry?

45:24.012 --> 45:25.180
You should try one too.

45:25.347 --> 45:28.016
I'm fine. You should eat a lot.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.601
It's so good.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.812
You're the best cook.

45:32.604 --> 45:34.815
It takes no skill to grill meat.

45:35.274 --> 45:36.400
Open wide.

45:36.567 --> 45:37.901
Eat just one.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.403
Should I?

45:49.371 --> 45:51.665
It's so yummy.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.167
One more.

45:53.709 --> 45:54.710
One more?

45:57.212 --> 45:58.422
"Favorite food.

46:00.632 --> 46:01.633
Nuts.

46:02.593 --> 46:03.594
Tteokbokki...

46:04.970 --> 46:06.054
with

46:07.347 --> 46:08.348
sesame seeds."

46:08.807 --> 46:11.143
What is this?

46:29.077 --> 46:30.037
Hey, Ji-hun.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.705
Is someone grilling pork belly
in the kitchen?

46:31.830 --> 46:33.332
Everyone went home.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.417
Who would be grilling meat?

46:42.341 --> 46:43.509
Gosh.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.179
My goodness, that smell.

46:47.513 --> 46:50.516
We have a home and got to eat meat.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.851
I'm so happy. So excited.

46:54.353 --> 46:56.980
I learned this dance at the nursery.

46:57.105 --> 46:58.106
Do you want to see?

47:02.861 --> 47:03.862
Catch me if you can!

47:03.946 --> 47:05.072
No running.

47:05.697 --> 47:07.783
Eun-seong, no running.

47:08.283 --> 47:09.284
Stop.

47:10.494 --> 47:11.495
Are you okay?

47:11.828 --> 47:13.497
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

47:13.705 --> 47:15.457
-Yes.
-Sit down.

47:28.804 --> 47:29.805
"Sundae."

47:43.944 --> 47:45.153
Favorite shoe brand.

47:52.160 --> 47:53.912
Shoe size, it's...

48:12.889 --> 48:15.142
Must I know this jerk's shoe size too?

48:16.476 --> 48:17.603
Must I?

48:25.402 --> 48:26.403
It's okay.

48:27.362 --> 48:28.739
You're doing the right thing.

48:29.489 --> 48:30.490
It's all right.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.452
You have a place to stay.

48:34.494 --> 48:35.621
You repaid your debt.

48:37.247 --> 48:39.916
And you're saving someone's life.

48:42.544 --> 48:43.545
And...

49:03.440 --> 49:04.941
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

49:05.359 --> 49:06.818
This is a submission from a lady.

49:06.943 --> 49:10.405
Last night, when I got home from a
work dinner, my home had been broken into.

49:10.489 --> 49:12.949
They took my laptop,
a wallet my friend gave me,

49:13.033 --> 49:16.078
and the piggy bank that I had been
saving in for over a year.

49:16.662 --> 49:19.373
Money is one thing. I couldn't sleep
because I was so scared.

49:19.665 --> 49:22.793
-The thief took my emergency cash.
-Gosh.

49:23.168 --> 49:24.795
This month is going to be difficult

49:25.003 --> 49:26.505
because of that thief.

49:27.047 --> 49:29.049
I had been robbed once as well.

49:29.508 --> 49:30.509
I was scared.

49:31.968 --> 49:33.345
I felt like they knew my number.

49:33.428 --> 49:34.638
-It was scary.
-I see.

49:35.514 --> 49:37.265
-I bet it was.
-You would be too, right?

49:38.058 --> 49:39.851
I think it would feel horrible.

49:41.061 --> 49:43.563
Take a look at the socks.
They're 1,000 won a pair.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.859
Get out of here. They're here.

49:47.943 --> 49:48.944
Again?

49:50.612 --> 49:52.989
-Move all this.
-Ma'am, you can't peddle here.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.283
-Move it!
-Okay.

49:55.367 --> 49:57.536
-Fine.
-Hurry up!

49:57.619 --> 49:58.787
-Gosh.
-Hurry up.

49:59.162 --> 50:00.414
How have you been, Mother?

50:01.289 --> 50:02.708
Who are you to call me Mother?

50:03.333 --> 50:04.626
I'll help out and go.

50:04.710 --> 50:05.711
Forget it. Go.

50:05.877 --> 50:06.878
Just this.

50:06.962 --> 50:08.463
-I said forget it!
-What are you doing?

50:08.547 --> 50:09.715
Move it!

50:09.840 --> 50:11.007
Okay!

50:11.508 --> 50:12.509
Gosh.

50:13.468 --> 50:14.720
Move it!

50:14.886 --> 50:16.638
Have some tea with me.

50:16.722 --> 50:17.889
Forget it. Go.

50:18.682 --> 50:19.725
Then here.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.144
At least take this.

50:25.021 --> 50:26.732
I know I hurt your feelings.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.275
I'm sorry.

50:29.067 --> 50:31.445
I bought you a sweater and long johns
for spring,

50:31.528 --> 50:33.321
since you get cold easily.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.490
And I put in a little bit of money too.

50:38.034 --> 50:39.161
Mother.

50:39.369 --> 50:40.454
Please take it.

50:42.622 --> 50:43.623
I said, leave.

50:44.207 --> 50:45.459
I don't need this,

50:46.126 --> 50:47.461
so don't ever come to see me again.

50:52.174 --> 50:53.175
Mother!

50:53.759 --> 50:56.011
I'll come with Eun-seong next time!

50:56.970 --> 50:59.264
She's gotten really big now!

51:00.432 --> 51:02.225
Don't you want to see her?

51:03.769 --> 51:04.895
Mother!

51:06.855 --> 51:08.148
Mother.

51:10.734 --> 51:11.860
Mother...

51:39.304 --> 51:40.972
You're so hard at work.

51:41.473 --> 51:43.099
Are you feeling okay?

51:43.892 --> 51:46.019
I wanted to walk for exercise.

51:46.311 --> 51:48.063
Good thinking.

51:48.313 --> 51:50.982
You need to get stronger
so that you can get your surgery.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.150
You should take walks too.

51:52.526 --> 51:55.904
May I ask you for a favor?

51:56.571 --> 51:57.572
Yes?

51:58.615 --> 52:02.244
My cell phone died,
so I lost all my numbers.

52:02.702 --> 52:05.121
I lost my son's and everyone else's.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.832
I don't know what to do.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.708
Oh, no.

52:10.126 --> 52:11.294
The thing is,

52:12.546 --> 52:16.216
I need to talk to my daughter-in-law
urgently about the surgery.

52:17.467 --> 52:19.427
You have her contact information, right?

52:19.970 --> 52:22.055
POSSIBLE HOSPITAL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

52:23.807 --> 52:24.766
Keep it down.

52:25.058 --> 52:26.059
Move.

52:31.439 --> 52:33.733
You must be happy
that it's easier to watch your kid.

52:34.568 --> 52:35.569
Yes.

52:35.777 --> 52:37.988
She goes to nursery school
during working hours.

52:38.071 --> 52:39.865
I'll make sure
she doesn't bother the business.

52:40.615 --> 52:44.828
I have a working wife and kids,
so I know how you feel.

52:45.662 --> 52:47.873
I misjudged Mr. Han.

52:48.039 --> 52:49.875
He hated kids even if they were customers.

52:50.458 --> 52:53.336
What's gotten into him?
He's turning over a new leaf.

52:54.379 --> 52:56.006
Stop laughing.

52:56.464 --> 52:57.674
INCOMING CALL

52:57.757 --> 52:58.842
What is that?

53:03.889 --> 53:05.015
Hello?

53:05.473 --> 53:08.643
I'm Han Ji-hun's mom.

53:09.853 --> 53:10.854
Pardon?

53:10.937 --> 53:12.647
Can we meet right now for a bit?

53:14.441 --> 53:15.442
Right now?

53:16.818 --> 53:18.528
I'm sorry.

53:19.529 --> 53:22.824
There must be a problem
with the donor's interview process.

53:23.575 --> 53:25.076
What problem?

53:25.327 --> 53:27.871
You and I need to meet and resolve this.

53:28.079 --> 53:29.915
Don't tell Ji-hun.

53:30.665 --> 53:32.208
Can you come to the hospital now?

53:34.586 --> 53:35.712
Yes.

53:52.771 --> 53:55.523
As for the second location of The Promise,

53:55.607 --> 53:59.444
it will be located at the hottest spot
among young people,

53:59.527 --> 54:01.613
Gyeongridan-gil of Itaewon.

54:01.738 --> 54:05.325
The theme of the second location will be
Italian fusion.

54:05.408 --> 54:07.160
The person you are trying
to reach cannot...

54:11.539 --> 54:13.166
Our marketing strategy will use

54:13.249 --> 54:15.877
social media to target
the 20s and 30s demographic,

54:15.961 --> 54:18.296
and create an online community
for The Promise.

54:19.714 --> 54:20.882
KANG HYE-SU

54:20.966 --> 54:21.925
IGNORE

54:23.843 --> 54:26.179
So in the demographic's leisure time...

54:26.262 --> 54:28.181
The person you are trying
to reach cannot...

54:43.905 --> 54:46.574
Hi, Hye-su. I was just about to head out.

54:46.825 --> 54:47.826
What do you need?

54:48.994 --> 54:50.620
Our shop is closed today.

54:50.996 --> 54:53.331
I couldn't help you move.
Don't you need help unpacking?

54:53.581 --> 54:56.167
Sorry, but I need to go somewhere.

54:56.543 --> 54:58.378
Will you take care of Eun-seong?

54:59.004 --> 55:00.005
I'll be right back.

55:00.422 --> 55:01.423
Sorry.

55:03.008 --> 55:04.050
Darn it.

55:07.387 --> 55:08.638
Not there.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.682
-No? Here?
-Yes.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.225
Let's go in.

55:12.308 --> 55:13.351
-Auntie.
-Yes?

55:13.476 --> 55:15.562
Once you take off your shoes,
close your eyes.

55:15.812 --> 55:16.813
What?

55:16.896 --> 55:19.524
Take off your shoes
and then close your eyes.

55:19.607 --> 55:20.608
-Close my eyes?
-Yes.

55:22.652 --> 55:23.653
Auntie.

55:24.029 --> 55:24.988
Gosh.

55:25.238 --> 55:26.072
Ta-da.

55:27.282 --> 55:28.950
So this is your new home.

55:29.034 --> 55:30.660
It's so nice.

55:31.536 --> 55:33.955
Gosh, your mom made a mess.

55:34.039 --> 55:36.499
-Put your bag down.
-Okay.

55:37.292 --> 55:40.253
Goodness. What was the big rush?

55:40.336 --> 55:41.546
Sit down.

55:41.629 --> 55:43.923
Once I clean this up, let's have

55:44.007 --> 55:45.592
a delicious snack.

55:45.675 --> 55:46.676
Okay.

55:47.886 --> 55:49.471
My goodness.

55:52.974 --> 55:55.268
What is this?

55:56.644 --> 55:57.896
HAN JI-HUN'S PROFILE

56:13.411 --> 56:14.454
You scared me.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.289
When did you get there?

56:17.040 --> 56:20.794
Why is my mom together with that man?

56:22.170 --> 56:23.338
Do you know him?

56:24.089 --> 56:26.091
-Give it to me!
-No.

56:26.257 --> 56:27.383
-It's nothing.
-Give it to me.

56:27.509 --> 56:29.511
It isn't your mom.

56:29.844 --> 56:31.846
-Give it to me!
-It really isn't your mom!

56:32.263 --> 56:33.723
It isn't your mom.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.226
-It isn't!
-I saw.

56:36.309 --> 56:37.769
-No.
-Stop lying!

56:37.894 --> 56:39.604
It really isn't her.

56:40.438 --> 56:43.108
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer the phone.

56:43.274 --> 56:45.485
Please leave a message after the tone.

56:49.697 --> 56:52.450
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer the phone.

56:52.617 --> 56:54.327
-Please leave a message...
-Seriously?

56:57.288 --> 56:58.498
-Hello?
-Where are you?

56:58.832 --> 57:00.834
-Are you here yet?
-Yes, I'm here.

57:01.334 --> 57:02.460
Okay.

57:05.547 --> 57:08.800
STRATEGIES FOR THE SECOND LOCATION
OF THE PROMISE

57:08.967 --> 57:10.510
Even if you're desperate,

57:10.677 --> 57:12.220
don't make up the numbers.

57:12.929 --> 57:14.722
It'll become a habit to use these tricks.

57:15.473 --> 57:16.724
What do you mean?

57:17.725 --> 57:18.810
Is that how it looked to you?

57:18.893 --> 57:20.770
I know everything.

57:21.146 --> 57:23.356
Family restaurants are things of the past.

57:23.481 --> 57:27.152
I told Dad that times are changing,
but he's so stubborn.

57:28.528 --> 57:29.487
Sorry.

57:29.988 --> 57:32.490
Our restaurant isn't keeping up
with the times.

57:33.032 --> 57:34.409
I'd like to forge the numbers.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.536
I keep getting franchise requests.

57:36.744 --> 57:37.745
They're so annoying.

57:37.829 --> 57:40.748
Punk. When will you ever stop
being so sarcastic?

57:41.082 --> 57:42.083
When?

57:45.503 --> 57:47.630
Do you really not know Na-yoon?

57:48.465 --> 57:51.759
Your New York apartment was
close to her school.

57:53.094 --> 57:55.513
I'm sure
all the foreign students knew her.

57:59.350 --> 58:00.560
All I did was study.

58:01.686 --> 58:02.687
I have a call.

58:02.770 --> 58:03.980
I'll get going. See you later.

58:06.608 --> 58:08.902
Hurry up and get to the hospital.

58:09.027 --> 58:10.028
Your mom called Hye-su

58:10.612 --> 58:11.779
to the hospital.

58:11.905 --> 58:13.907
What? How did she get her number?

58:14.115 --> 58:15.325
You didn't give it to her?

58:16.201 --> 58:18.036
I have a bad feeling about this.

58:18.161 --> 58:20.497
She told her something urgent happened
and to hurry right over.

58:21.456 --> 58:23.291
Why weren't you answering your phone?

58:25.210 --> 58:26.336
Hello?

58:27.462 --> 58:31.799
This punk. He's always hanging up.

58:32.467 --> 58:33.551
So annoying.

58:33.718 --> 58:34.719
Welcome.

58:38.973 --> 58:40.225
What do you do for a living?

58:41.851 --> 58:42.894
I'm a chef.

58:43.895 --> 58:45.480
You met while studying abroad?

58:46.648 --> 58:47.649
Yes.

58:48.233 --> 58:49.234
And then,

58:50.235 --> 58:51.778
you reunited here

58:52.028 --> 58:53.613
many years later?

58:56.824 --> 58:57.825
Yes.

58:58.535 --> 58:59.536
It must have been

59:00.703 --> 59:02.705
difficult to date

59:03.248 --> 59:04.332
in secret.

59:06.960 --> 59:08.336
I know Ji-hun

59:09.045 --> 59:10.046
would not decide

59:10.755 --> 59:12.882
to get married so easily.

59:15.885 --> 59:17.095
Hye-su, was it?

59:18.346 --> 59:20.682
Do you love Ji-hun?

59:23.768 --> 59:24.769
Yes.

59:24.852 --> 59:26.145
It's so strange.

59:28.273 --> 59:30.108
You don't look like you mean it.

59:32.110 --> 59:33.820
Tell me the truth.

59:34.445 --> 59:36.781
Have you two really dated for a long time?

59:38.199 --> 59:39.200
No, right?

59:51.254 --> 59:52.672
How much is he paying you?

59:54.048 --> 59:55.883
It's not like that.

59:55.967 --> 59:58.469
Don't expect me to fall for that lie.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:01.681
Tell me the truth.

1:00:02.890 --> 1:00:03.975
I've thought it over,

1:00:04.475 --> 1:00:05.476
and this is wrong.

1:00:06.269 --> 1:00:07.270
It's strange.

1:00:08.104 --> 1:00:09.105
Answer me.

1:00:09.689 --> 1:00:12.483
How much is he paying you to do this?

1:00:23.745 --> 1:00:24.871
Whatever it is,

1:00:26.414 --> 1:00:27.790
she's saving your life.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:30.251
Why are you doing this to her?

1:00:33.463 --> 1:00:35.006
What in life isn't an exchange?

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:38.509
Even love and marriage are deals
when you think about it.

1:00:38.926 --> 1:00:40.428
It really is fake.

1:00:45.099 --> 1:00:46.100
If I say it's real,

1:00:46.893 --> 1:00:48.019
will you believe me?

1:00:50.104 --> 1:00:51.564
I really love her.

1:00:52.732 --> 1:00:54.275
I'm marrying her because I love her.

1:00:54.359 --> 1:00:55.485
Stop fooling around.

1:00:56.235 --> 1:00:57.779
I knew from the start.

1:00:59.739 --> 1:01:00.740
Fine.

1:01:01.115 --> 1:01:02.450
Let's say you're right.

1:01:03.493 --> 1:01:05.453
But regardless, what's the problem?

1:01:06.537 --> 1:01:08.706
I was never going to get married anyway.

1:01:09.165 --> 1:01:10.291
She needed money.

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:11.793
You needed to live.

1:01:12.710 --> 1:01:14.754
Great. Everyone here wins.

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:17.340
-What's the problem?
-Stop joking around.

1:01:17.507 --> 1:01:18.716
What are you trying to do?

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:20.593
Does your dad know?

1:01:21.886 --> 1:01:23.805
Why are you afraid of him?

1:01:23.971 --> 1:01:25.390
He left you anyway.

1:01:26.391 --> 1:01:29.185
You've been the mistress for so long.
Why do you care?

1:01:29.602 --> 1:01:31.562
Why do you still have
lingering feelings for him?

1:01:34.857 --> 1:01:36.025
Fine. I'm full of regrets.

1:01:36.442 --> 1:01:37.985
Not for your dad, but for you.

1:01:38.653 --> 1:01:40.905
How could you go about doing
something reckless like this?

1:01:41.531 --> 1:01:42.824
What if you get caught?

1:01:43.783 --> 1:01:45.284
Do you want to lose

1:01:45.618 --> 1:01:47.870
everything you've worked so hard to build?

1:01:48.246 --> 1:01:51.666
You care that much about your son?
That's why you did this to yourself?

1:01:52.417 --> 1:01:54.252
How many times did I tell you
not to drink?

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:56.546
Even after you were diagnosed,
you drank and drank.

1:01:57.130 --> 1:02:00.007
Why didn't you just die then?
Why are you doing this to me now?

1:02:00.216 --> 1:02:02.552
You have no right to demand
anything of me.

1:02:02.885 --> 1:02:04.303
What's been done is done.

1:02:04.429 --> 1:02:05.555
It's too late.

1:02:07.390 --> 1:02:08.391
Let's go, Hye-su.

1:02:10.643 --> 1:02:11.644
Wait...

1:02:31.581 --> 1:02:33.166
I have to get back to the office.

1:02:34.542 --> 1:02:35.543
Go back.

1:02:40.047 --> 1:02:42.800
It would've been better
to tell her the truth.

1:02:45.636 --> 1:02:47.764
Are you making excuses
after that horrible acting?

1:02:47.889 --> 1:02:48.973
She's your mom.

1:02:49.891 --> 1:02:51.601
Don't you think she'll know?

1:02:51.893 --> 1:02:53.060
Everything aside,

1:02:53.394 --> 1:02:55.772
it was wrong to lie to your mom.

1:02:57.482 --> 1:02:58.858
Are you lecturing me?

1:03:00.485 --> 1:03:01.486
Forget it.

1:03:02.028 --> 1:03:03.029
Let's quit.

1:03:03.988 --> 1:03:04.989
Let's forget it all!

1:03:06.115 --> 1:03:07.283
Look here, Mr. Han.

1:03:07.575 --> 1:03:08.576
Excuse me.

1:03:09.285 --> 1:03:11.204
You're Ms. Oh Mi-ran's
daughter-in-law, correct?

1:03:14.999 --> 1:03:16.000
Yes.

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:17.710
I'm glad you're here.

1:03:17.919 --> 1:03:19.670
He's the social worker
who's in charge of her case.

1:03:19.879 --> 1:03:22.089
You haven't scheduled
the interview yet, have you?

1:03:22.882 --> 1:03:25.384
Why don't we do it now,
since you're both here?

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:30.848
Right now?

1:03:58.209 --> 1:03:59.961
First, I need to get closer with the kid.

1:04:00.086 --> 1:04:01.879
Did you invite him?

1:04:01.963 --> 1:04:03.464
Why did you come here?

1:04:03.548 --> 1:04:05.550
Stop arguing with me.
I don't like it either.

1:04:06.092 --> 1:04:08.052
I won't sell my son
in order to save my life!

1:04:08.135 --> 1:04:10.888
Who knows where she's from?
How could you do something so dangerous?

1:04:10.972 --> 1:04:11.973
I'll go now.

1:04:12.098 --> 1:04:13.099
Wait.

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:14.684
Let's have dinner tomorrow.

1:04:16.519 --> 1:04:18.521
